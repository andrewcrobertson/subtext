50760 51843 On your feet!
72885 74135 An American, Colonel.
74468 76468 He was at the gate,<br />impersonating an officer.
83010 84135 You were alone?
85718 88593 Spy, you were alone?
88760 90260 I like to be alone.
91551 93343 What did you come here for?
94176 96593 You got a lot of nice stuff.
96718 98093 Other people's stuff.
99760 101843 "To the victor belongs the spoils."
103135 104301 "To the victor"?
105301 106801 Berlin's in rubble.
107010 108551 The Führer's in hiding.
109801 111510 You lost.
115426 116843 Take him upstairs.
117468 118468 What? What?
118510 119510 Hey!
119551 120635 Hey, wait a second. Guys!
120801 122176 A moment. Please!
122885 124468 Stop! I must speak to the commander.
124718 126593 Colonel. I found it!
128676 130051 Do as he says. Open it.
135426 136426 Doctor.
144468 146468 The Lance of Long in us.
147968 150301 The blade that drew Christ's blood.
151135 152426 The Holy Lance.
162635 164801 Double the guard.<br />This is the prize the Führer seeks.
165051 166051 Colonel, we need to talk.
166093 167260 No time, Doctor.
167468 168801 The train to Berlin is waiting.
170385 171385 Search the woods!
171510 172510 Take the dogs.
173385 174718 Do you think that spy was alone?
175385 176843 Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!
177135 178135 On the double!
203926 206301 Looks like they're<br />leaving without you guys.
207593 209718 Tell us your story, or die.
210468 211468 Story.
212676 214510 Okay, okay.
214676 215676 Well...
216510 218093 it all started...
218676 222760 once upon a time,<br />when this village...
222968 227426 of stupid blue-eyed boys<br />decided to join hands together...
227551 230843 and follow this sweaty little pied piper<br />named Adolf...
251093 252093 No.
330551 332635 This man was with the American.
334385 335468 This is the American's bag.
337343 338343 What have I done?
342843 344260 Bring him to my carriage.
352093 354885 Careful. This is the<br />Führer's special relic!
384426 385718 Stay seated.
386551 387926 So...
390760 392676 you are a birdwatcher?
396426 398301 Yes. Because of the bombing,
398551 401176 the wagtails are following<br />a completely different trajectory.
405135 406843 We caught your accomplice.
408093 409510 The American.
475135 476135 Oh, my!
502260 503510 Get off of me!
531801 534385 There's one reason you're still alive,<br />birdwatcher.
537093 538551 Who sent you?
538718 539926 What was your mission?
540135 542135 Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.
542301 544551 My name is Basil Shaw.
545760 547510 I'm a professor at Oxford.
547635 549301 An archeologist.
556843 557926 There you are.
562051 564135 There is a problem.
565176 566426 I must speak to the Colonel.
566885 568676 It's urgent.
571135 573010 I have a daughter. I beg you.
573635 576385 I guarantee you will never see<br />your child again, Mr. Shaw.
579676 582635 Unless you explain<br />why your accomplice had this.
605176 609301 We were told that the Lance of Long in us<br />could be found at the fortress.
610218 611218 We were looking for it.
612176 613176 Why?
614676 615718 Because of its power?
616843 619551 It has no power.
622260 624801 My friend and I were<br />trying to save history.
627510 628926 I must speak with the Colonel.
630218 631260 It's about the Lance.
677968 679343 I only had a moment to look at it.
679551 681260 Of course, my training is in physics,
681760 683718 For God's sake, spit it out!
685801 686801 The Lance...
689260 690926 It's a fake.
691510 692510 It's a fake.
692760 693885 A fake?
696218 697676 The blade is an alloy.
697843 699260 Fifty years old,
699468 701551 the engravings recent. It's a replica.
701760 702760 We're dead.
705551 707801 Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.
708510 710135 Ramesses II.
711468 713260 None of this stuff is fake.
716093 717593 I gotta stop this train.
718010 719490 There is another relic on this train.
720510 721843 One with real power.
722385 723510 What are you talking about?
725510 726510 The Antikythera.
727135 727885 The Antikythera?!
728051 730051 Enough about that old dial!
730301 732468 Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...
732885 734260 and his mind!
736551 737801 Let me explain.
739760 742301 The Antikythera's<br />power is not supernatural.
742676 744551 It is mathematics.
746343 747760 Whoever harnesses it...
749843 751426 will not be King...
752135 753135 nor Emperor...
754510 755718 or Führer.
759218 761051 He will be God.
779510 781051 Too many Nazis.
784885 787468 And how do you propose we tell him this?
788218 789218 My Führer,
789510 791551 I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.
791801 793051 But here is...
794468 797218 half of something you've never heard of.
798718 799718 Tell me,
800135 801635 have you ever met Hitler?!!
804218 805301 A saboteur aboard.
805510 806801 And Hitler's Lance is gone.
848135 849385 That way!
853010 854301 What are you doing here?!
861551 862551 What the hell?
863926 865343 Indy?
865468 866468 Baz?
866760 867760 You're alive!
868385 869385 So far.
870260 872468 I thought I told you<br />to stay in the woods, Baz.
872593 876676 What sort of a man hides in a hedge<br />while his friend is facing death?
889801 893551 This lot are carting off<br />half the world's antiquities.
893718 896760 I was gonna stop 'em,<br />but now I've gotta rescue you.
897468 898843 Did you at least find the Lance?
899343 901135 - "At least"?<br />- Well, have you got it?
901635 902510 It's a fake.
902635 903635 What?
904176 905510 A reproduction.
908260 909260 Who are you?
913635 914635 Indy?
923593 924843 The Antikythera.
926051 927718 Archimedes' Dial.
929260 930260 Bring it.
947968 949093 Hurry up, Baz.
952010 953426 Give me that.
953551 954676 Come on.
969343 970843 Get up, Baz.
971051 972301 Follow me.
972885 974260 Towards the gun?
974426 975676 Away from the Nazis!
976093 978051 Those are Nazis!
978593 980593 Get down! Down! Down!
1029801 1031010 This way. Come on!
1031635 1032635 I can't do that!
1032718 1034593 You wanna stop for a little lie-down?
1038426 1039760 They have the Antikythera!
1041260 1042260 Easy.
1073301 1074301 Tunnel!
1084885 1086426 Got you! No!
1126801 1128051 Indy!
1136218 1137301 Get the gun!
1146510 1147843 Shoot him!
1150801 1151843 Not me!
1153010 1154010 Sorry.
1173343 1175343 To the victor go the spoils.
1206260 1208010 Drop the gun.
1210718 1212260 Give me the Antikythera.
1223343 1224718 Indy!
1235635 1236635 Hey!
1239551 1241885 - Here!<br />- They can't hear you, Baz.
1242468 1243801 We gotta jump!
1244051 1245385 What about my dicky knee?
1252301 1253301 Baz!
1254218 1255218 Baz!
1257051 1258093 Baz!
1259426 1261135 - Indy!<br />- Baz!
1266426 1267843 Go! Move! Move it!
1269593 1272510 Bit rum to go home empty-handed<br />after all that.
1273093 1274343 "Empty-handed"?
1274510 1275801 Not exactly.
1278593 1279718 Archimedes' Dial.
1279885 1280926 Well, half of it.
1281093 1283301 Come on, Baz. Let's get home.
1348593 1351218 Larry! Turn it down!
1352260 1353510 Turn it down!
1353676 1355510 Hey, Larry!
1370260 1371260 Larry!
1372676 1373676 Larry!
1373718 1375385 - Hi, Mr. Jones.<br />- Where's Larry?
1376676 1377426 Who is this guy?
1377551 1378676 It's the old guy next door.
1378843 1380510 Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.
1380635 1383051 - "It's 8:00 in the morning."<br />- We talked about this, Larry.
1383176 1384176 Yeah, but that was...
1384301 1386760 - a workday, Mr. Jones.<br />- This is a workday too, Larry!
1388176 1389343 Turn on the news.
1389468 1390801 It's moon day, Mr. Jones.
1392010 1393218 Moon day?
1446510 1447510 Thanks.
1460926 1462718 All you really need to remember...
1462926 1466468 is that Assyrian ceramics of this period<br />are characterized...
1466635 1470593 by this complex blue-line pattern.
1470760 1471760 Okay?
1472843 1476260 I assigned pages 131 through 171...
1476468 1478051 in Winford for today.
1478218 1479718 Anybody do the reading?
1482176 1483176 Anyone?
1485801 1487843 Gosh, this is on the test.
1488051 1489260 Okay.
1490426 1492468 Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.
1495343 1497885 In 213 BC...
1498093 1500093 Roman forces led by Marcellus...
1500301 1503093 laid siege to the city of Syracuse.
1503260 1504926 "Syracuse."
1506385 1509010 Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.
1509135 1510718 The one in Sicily.
1511468 1513885 Amongst the defenders of the city...
1514093 1517176 was its most famous resident, who was...
1519385 1521051 Come on, guys. This is on the final.
1521718 1523385 Archimedes.
1524260 1525301 Archimedes.
1525468 1526760 Archimedes, who was a...
1526885 1528051 A mathematician.
1528218 1529385 A mathematician.
1529551 1532135 But more than that, an inventor...
1532301 1534801 a brilliant engineer...
1535010 1539343 who conceived of a way to harness<br />the energy of the Mediterranean sun...
1539468 1542218 on concave mirrors and focus it...
1542385 1545010 on attacking Roman warships<br />and set them on fire.
1545218 1548635 Who devised giant iron claws...
1548760 1551426 that could snatch hostiles from the sea.
1553968 1556843 But how do we know it really happened?
1558010 1562010 What physical, irrefutable<br />archeological evidence...
1562176 1565468 - is there of these inventions?<br />- The Antikythera.
1566801 1569051 - The Antikythera.<br />- For starters.
1569218 1571218 They're here! They're downtown!
1573135 1574510 The astronauts.
1574635 1576968 Giant parade this morning will be seen...
1577135 1580260 by about two and a half million people<br />lining the sidewalks...
1583301 1584718 He's coming. He's come. See?
1584885 1586301 Oh, here he comes.
1587343 1588343 Hide the cake.
1590010 1592093 - Surprise.<br />- Surprise!
1596218 1597385 For over a decade now...
1597510 1602010 our colleague Dr. Jones has been<br />a loyal servant of Hunter.
1603468 1605010 A token of our gratitude.
1612343 1613343 Wow.
1617635 1619551 Thanks for putting up with me.
1634010 1635010 Here.
1643510 1646551 Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,<br />and Buzz Aldrin...
1646676 1648676 will not be able to avoid the spotlight.
1648801 1652551 At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,<br />a grateful nation will pay homage...
1652718 1655343 with a ticker-tape parade<br />through New York and Chicago...
1655510 1657051 climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...
1657176 1658468 What would the ancients say?
1659010 1660760 Neil, Buzz, and Mike...
1660926 1663635 If they knew we walked on the moon?
1663843 1665385 Speaking as an ancient...
1665510 1668051 going to the moon is like going to Reno.
1668218 1669510 Middle of nowhere...
1670635 1672176 and no blackjack.
1673218 1674760 You don't recognize me, do you?
1677135 1679176 Whatever I did, I apologize.
1680135 1681176 It's Helena.
1682760 1683801 Helena Shaw.
1685635 1686843 Wombat?
1687051 1688635 Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.
1689343 1690926 - You got tall.<br />- I did.
1691135 1692426 It's fair to say.
1694510 1695593 I'm celebrating.
1696676 1698885 - I'm retiring.<br />- Oh.
1699468 1701268 Wow.<br />Well, in that case, what are we drinking?
1706343 1708093 Room service for Mr. Schmidt.
1720593 1721593 Put that away.
1721676 1723551 I was asking how you broke your ankle.
1724385 1725385 None of your business.
1725468 1726468 Are you Mr. Schmidt?
1726510 1728635 "Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.
1728801 1731593 And he don't eat anything on wheels,<br />so put it on a table.
1733093 1734343 When I was a little boy...
1734843 1736051 I always imagined...
1736218 1739885 that one day man would walk on the moon.
1740426 1741510 And by golly...
1748218 1749843 Quite a celebration out there.
1753301 1754760 The man you're servin'...
1754926 1757218 he's the one who put those astronauts<br />on the moon.
1757385 1758625 Built the rockets they rode in.
1759843 1761135 Congratulations.
1761510 1762510 Where are you from?
1763468 1764301 The Bronx, sir.
1764426 1766426 No, no. I mean originally, your people.
1766510 1767510 Do you know?
1772218 1773843 I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.
1776510 1778301 And you fought for your country?
1779260 1780676 320th Battalion.
1780843 1783218 Set up balloons to stop the planes<br />bombing Normandy.
1788676 1790510 And are you enjoying your victory?
1798468 1799588 Will there be anything else?
1801968 1803176 You didn't win the war.
1804843 1806010 Hitler lost it.
1811551 1812551 Yeah.
1813676 1816426 My field agent, she found Shaw.
1817426 1818551 Yeah, I'm comin'.
1818718 1819718 Let's go, Hauke.
1823093 1824385 Where are we here?
1825468 1827385 Oxford. In the garden.
1829218 1830510 He was an original.
1832926 1834343 I just graduated.
1834468 1835468 In Archeology.
1836468 1838551 Archeology. Wow.
1838718 1840343 Apple didn't fall far.
1840468 1843218 Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.
1844426 1845426 What's your subject?
1846218 1848218 The Archimedes Dial.
1848801 1850301 The Antikythera.
1853218 1854551 What do you know about that?
1855093 1856426 Well, for starters...
1856593 1860010 in 1902, Greek sponge divers found<br />a wrecked Roman warship...
1860176 1861468 huge, off the coast of Greece.
1862176 1863843 Below deck, sealed in wax...
1864051 1865510 was a clock-like mechanism...
1865676 1868510 finely tooled, purpose unknown.
1868635 1872635 Nothing approximating its complexity<br />appears in the world for 1,000 years.
1873760 1875885 - You've done your homework.<br />- Well, not me.
1876093 1879093 Dad. He had all these journals,<br />reams of notes about it.
1879260 1881093 He was obsessed till the end.
1884760 1886926 He told me you found it<br />on a Nazi plunder train.
1888385 1891468 And then lost it in a river<br />in the French Alps.
1894301 1895541 Well, that was a long time ago.
1895593 1897051 And it was only half the Dial.
1897260 1898861 - Archimedes...<br />- Archimedes broke the Dial in two...
1898885 1900027 - ...disassembled it.<br />- ...and then hid...
1900051 1902194 the two halves from the Romans<br />during the siege of Syracuse.
1902218 1903468 I know. Look.
1904593 1906593 You don't remember the last time I saw you,<br />do you?
1908093 1909176 Remember what?
1909343 1910343 These are the Alps.
1911676 1913301 Yeah, I see.
1913468 1915343 And this is the route<br />that your train took...
1915468 1917468 - from the Nazi stronghold in '44.<br />- Right.
1917551 1919426 It went through this mountain pass...
1919551 1921051 and then here.
1921260 1923468 - Here, it's the only river on the route.<br />- Right.
1923593 1924676 Under a bridge.
1924801 1926218 It's down there. It's got to be.
1926426 1928801 - And nobody knows except us.<br />- "Us"?
1929093 1930593 Well, I mean, you.
1930760 1932301 And me. So, yeah.
1932468 1934301 - Us.<br />- Us.
1935301 1937801 And what were you thinking exactly?
1939301 1940385 Well, that maybe...
1942218 1943676 we could go there.
1943843 1944885 And?
1945135 1946218 And find it.
1947093 1948718 And I'd become...
1950385 1951510 famous.
1951676 1952968 Oh, well, not famous.
1953135 1954135 Renowned. Feted.
1954551 1956343 A feted archeologist.
1956468 1958260 And you, a final triumph!
1958426 1959426 Indiana Jones!
1959468 1961510 Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!
1964551 1966051 I'm not selling this, am I?
1968510 1969676 Wombat...
1971801 1973676 why are you chasing the thing...
1975468 1977510 that drove your father crazy?
1983468 1984885 Wouldn't you?
2003218 2004051 I got it.
2004218 2005218 Parade's comin' soon.
2006385 2007385 So, what we got?
2009010 2011343 She's in there, third<br />floor, with an old guy.
2011468 2012593 Who is he, a Russian?
2012801 2014676 No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.
2016010 2017010 Klaber!
2017343 2019426 Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!
2019551 2020801 Goddammit!<br />Go.
2021010 2023593 I'll get support up here<br />and pull a file on Jones.
2044260 2045510 This way.
2081593 2084676 Basil became obsessed<br />by this German theory.
2086218 2087551 Conjecture, really.
2090176 2092468 Archimedes had figured out...
2092551 2094801 that the movements of<br />the moon and planets...
2095676 2096885 weren't perfect.
2098218 2100676 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.
2101843 2104135 He thought these irregularities might...
2104301 2107676 explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.
2109801 2111135 Storms, even.
2112468 2115385 So, he set about building a device<br />to predict them.
2117093 2120968 But then, he stumbled upon a method<br />to predict even larger...
2121676 2122676 disturbances.
2124593 2126010 Larger disturbances?
2126635 2128843 Your father thought this thing could...
2129551 2131801 predict fissures in time.
2148760 2150343 Hauke, if you don't...
2152718 2153801 Found 'em.
2162468 2163468 Hello.
2164551 2166760 Are you looking for...
2167010 2168176 Dr. Jones?
2171760 2173051 Excuse me, can I help you?
2173676 2174676 No, thank you.
2174718 2176468 Just a routine investigation, ma'am.
2177510 2180010 Are you the police?
2180176 2181468 It'll just be a few moments.
2181676 2183468 - Professor Plimpton.<br />- Ma'am.
2183676 2184801 - Professor Plimpton!<br />- Ma'am!
2189343 2190343 Drop your weapon.
2190510 2191630 What the hell are you doin'?
2192801 2194885 What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.
2195135 2196135 Mandy?
2200718 2202760 Yeah, no witnesses.
2207135 2209218 Jesus. What the hell?
2209468 2212801 Your father wrote so many letters<br />about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.
2215926 2218593 You really don't remember the last time<br />I was at your house?
2220593 2222510 I took that from him then.
2224093 2225801 I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.
2225968 2229843 But your father was convinced this thing<br />was real and dangerous.
2230010 2232010 Do not shoot.
2232385 2235801 He was terrified that if somebody found<br />this legendary tablet,
2236010 2237135 the Grafikos...
2237260 2239500 The tablet containing directions<br />to the rest of the Dial.
2239551 2240819 And if they found the Grafikos...
2240843 2242527 they might acquire the other half<br />of the Dial...
2242551 2243551 and put the two together.
2245135 2246375 I knew you wouldn't destroy it.
2249885 2251760 How did you know he asked me to destroy it?
2252260 2253093 What?
2253260 2254635 You do remember that night.
2256051 2258801 - I was 12 years old, Indy.<br />- You knew we didn't drop it in a river.
2259593 2260718 Baz didn't tell you that.
2260885 2262885 - See, listen. I didn't...<br />- No, he never lied.
2263426 2265760 - No. You...<br />- What was all that crap about the map?
2266010 2267330 No, you've had too many whiskeys.
2267843 2268923 What are you doing, Wombat?
2268968 2270176 Stay where you are.
2271635 2272635 Don't move.
2273301 2274819 - Who are these people?<br />- We need to get out of here.
2274843 2275718 Are they with you?
2275843 2277051 Not an inch, Miss Shaw.
2278426 2279426 Miss Shaw, stop!
2282760 2283760 Helena!
2289051 2290051 Stop!
2291760 2292801 Sorry.
2293051 2293801 Helena!
2293968 2295801 Dr. Jones. It's over.
2296010 2297260 Who are you people?
2297426 2298510 What do you want?
2300510 2301510 Stop!
2303510 2304301 Helena Shaw!
2304510 2305861 She's on the roof. Find another way up.
2305885 2306885 Dr. Jones!
2307510 2308950 Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.
2335426 2337926 - Move. We gotta follow 'em.<br />- Go. Hurry up.
2365468 2366468 Fan out!
2379510 2382027 - Let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!<br />- Come on. Get everything.
2382051 2383135 Found her!
2411510 2413843 - Operator.<br />- I need the police.
2414051 2416343 Hunter College. People are dead.
2416468 2417510 - Please...<br />- Hang up, fella.
2423468 2424468 Stand up.
2429968 2430968 Okay, okay.
2455385 2456843 She's gone. You blew it...
2457051 2458260 you trigger-happy cracker.
2458426 2460885 - She had it in her hand.<br />- We got the professor.
2464468 2465593 Here's the file on Jones.
2465760 2466760 Yes.
2485010 2486051 Who are you?
2486218 2487593 That's my question.
2498135 2499593 You're CIA.
2499760 2501510 Oh, not me, man.
2501676 2503635 I don't take government jobs.
2503801 2504801 Okay.
2506176 2508343 How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?
2508718 2510010 She's my goddaughter.
2510718 2512343 I haven't seen her in 18 years.
2512468 2514635 Why did you meet with her today?<br />To give her the Dial?
2516093 2518510 Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.
2519510 2520510 Half a hunk.
2520593 2522343 Oh, it's a lot more than that.
2524010 2525093 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2525301 2526581 Where do you think you're going?
2526676 2528051 I got a parade going on.
2528218 2529698 And a demonstration coming down here.
2529843 2530885 Hey! Hey, hey!
2531551 2532593 - Hey...<br />- Shut up.
2532760 2535176 I can't go this way. Gotta go back.
2540218 2541885 Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?
2542135 2543676 Damn it!<br />Let's go on foot.
2543843 2544843 You heard her.
2546718 2547736 What the hell were you thinking?
2547760 2549240 - Walk! Come on.<br />- What is your problem?
2549301 2550861 - You don't look when you're backin' up?<br />- Take care of that guy.
2550885 2551718 Who's gonna pay for that?
2551843 2553051 Easy, fella. Easy.
2553218 2553968 Keep movin'.
2554135 2555843 Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.
2556010 2558490 No, you're gonna have to pay<br />for this bodywork, man. I don't...
2560510 2562843 Peace now! Peace now!
2564301 2567135 Stop the war! Stop the fighting!
2567301 2569051 - Where are we going, Mason?<br />- This way.
2571051 2572635 - Hell no, we won't go.<br />- Shut up.
2572760 2574260 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no!
2574551 2577135 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no, we won't go!
2577301 2578301 We won't go!
2578343 2580718 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no, we won't go!
2581301 2582718 - Hell no...<br />- Shut up!
2583093 2584093 Hell yeah!
2593885 2594885 Hell no...
2605843 2606843 Hey!
2607593 2609551 Officer! Help me!
2610343 2611843 Officer, there was a shooting...
2612051 2614011 - All right, all right.<br />- ...this morning at Hunter.
2614051 2615718 People are dead. God damn it.
2615926 2619301 - Some rogue maniacs broke in and...<br />- Sir, you need to calm it down.
2619468 2620593 Please listen to me.
2620760 2622885 There was a shooting<br />this morning, and the...
2623093 2626510 They're in a Con Ed van<br />right around the corner!
2629093 2630718 Hey! What do you think you're doing?
2642843 2644260 - Watch out!<br />- What's he doin'?
2665051 2666135 You did it!
2693426 2694426 Move, out the way!
2702551 2703551 Watch out!
2705718 2706885 Move! Quickly!
2721635 2722635 Move! Move!
2733135 2734468 Go, go, go!
2755093 2757760 Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.
2757926 2758926 Come on!
2761260 2763135 - Hey, mister.<br />- Move! Out of the way!
2763426 2764301 Hold my horse.
2764426 2765510 Move! Move!
2765676 2768468 Transfer is available<br />for IND Queens Boulevard.
2777885 2780885 Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.
2782760 2784051 Subway is faster.
2785510 2789343 People tend to romanticize science,<br />when it is, in fact, quite cold.
2789468 2791051 So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?
2792176 2793176 Mars?
2794051 2795468 No, we've conquered space.
2797301 2798968 I'm moving to the next frontier.
2800468 2802843 What's beyond space?
2806468 2809468 You might wanna get that suit pressed,<br />Dr. Schmidt.
2810135 2811676 We leave for the airport in an hour.
2812135 2813319 He's gonna meet the President.
2813343 2815027 If the President objects<br />to a few creases...
2815051 2817301 perhaps he should find himself<br />another physicist.
2818301 2820135 - Can I use that?<br />- No.
2820510 2821510 Yes.
2823051 2824051 Baxter.
2827843 2828968 It's for you, Doctor.
2832718 2834760 I may wanna leave a bit later<br />for Los Angeles.
2834926 2837218 I'm expecting a delivery shortly.
2840426 2841301 Speak.
2841426 2842885 Your goons made a mess.
2843135 2844301 Did they?
2844468 2846801 Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.
2847510 2849260 She acquired the device from him.
2850135 2851218 Then we lost her.
2852885 2854551 Dr. Jones got away as well.
2854968 2856135 Is that so?
2856301 2857635 Most unfortunate.
2858051 2859551 I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.
2859760 2862051 And as a representative<br />of the United States government...
2862218 2863885 I urge you to cooperate.
2864093 2865493 Get on that plane to Los Angeles...
2866218 2867738 and get your medal from the President.
2875051 2876051 Hello?
2876635 2878801 Call our friends<br />and secure a private charter.
2880218 2881218 To Morocco.
2881301 2882468 Yes, sir.
2883385 2886551 The university murders took place<br />at the height of the parade.
2886760 2890218 Police are searching for retired professor<br />Dr. Henry Jones.
2890385 2893385 A colleague told ABC<br />that Jones recently lost his son...
2893510 2895510 and was in the middle of a divorce.
2898260 2900885 This guy, he looks like you.
2901843 2904260 Nah. No.
2906218 2907218 It is you.
2907385 2908218 No, no, no. Hey.
2908385 2910069 - Go home, pal. You're drunk.<br />- This is the guy!
2910093 2911343 - Hey!<br />- It's the killer!
2914051 2915426 Sorry I'm late, Indy.
2915551 2917051 Bridge traffic.
2927885 2930051 Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.
2930885 2932885 I wish I could say the same, old friend.
2936218 2938135 Quickly, Indy. Inside.
2941843 2944218 Your goddaughter, Helena...
2944385 2947010 was arrested in Tangier last year...
2947885 2949885 for auctioning contraband.
2952426 2953426 There's more.
2954510 2957926 She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.
2958676 2961468 Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...
2961635 2964426 a well-known Moroccan mobster.
2966010 2969593 Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...
2969760 2972426 in Tangier, and this week...
2972551 2976676 the hotel is hosting its annual auction...
2976843 2978718 of stolen antiquities.
2979885 2982385 All the big players are already there.
2982510 2984343 Alia, Jabari.
2984468 2988635 This is the great man who brought<br />our family to America during the war.
2988843 2991260 Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?
2992135 2993718 1956.
2994260 2995593 Very impressive, Jabari.
2995718 2998218 My grandchildren watch too much TV...
2998385 3000843 but they know their history.
3001051 3005176 They understand what it is<br />to be American and Egyptian.
3006051 3008218 I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.
3009301 3011801 If you run, the police will assume<br />that you're guilty.
3012468 3015801 Without Helena or the Dial,<br />I'm gonna get framed for murder.
3017051 3018593 Have you thought about calling Marion?
3019676 3021051 She doesn't wanna talk to me.
3027218 3030801 Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy<br />International Airport.
3031635 3034111 The upper level is for Pan American<br />Airlines passenger drop off only.
3034135 3035926 I took something else from your apartment.
3036135 3037301 It was under the bed.
3042468 3043510 Thanks, Sallah.
3045760 3047593 I also brought my passport.
3049635 3050801 I could help you.
3051010 3052010 In Tangier?
3052093 3053718 Wherever chance takes us.
3054635 3055718 Indy, I...
3056635 3058093 I miss the desert.
3058676 3060010 I miss the sea.
3061468 3063301 And I miss waking up every morning...
3063468 3066551 wondering what wonderful adventure<br />the new day will bring to us.
3067510 3069551 This is not an adventure, Sallah.
3071010 3073593 Those days have come and gone.
3073718 3074760 Perhaps.
3074968 3076343 Perhaps not.
3080760 3083385 Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!
3094968 3095968 Champagne?
3096468 3098343 We've got four more hours to Tangier.
3106051 3107468 Your scotch, sir.
3108093 3109135 Thanks.
3116051 3117426 Basil. Come on, Baz!
3117510 3119343 - Open the door!<br />- No!
3119510 3120968 - Stay out, Indy!<br />- Open the door.
3124176 3126051 The Germans were right, Indy.
3126718 3128510 - What?<br />- It's too big. It's too much.
3128676 3129510 Hey, Ba...<br />Hey, hey!
3129676 3131468 - Hey, Baz! Give me...<br />- No.
3131635 3133861 - What are you doing?<br />- You've listened to nothing that I said.
3133885 3135635 I don't understand it, Baz!
3136051 3138051 Well, I was trying to explain it<br />to you downstairs.
3138176 3140776 - You've just ignored everything.<br />- You're terrifying your daughter.
3142551 3144635 Indy, Archimedes...
3144801 3147051 discovered a temporal meteorology.
3147301 3149843 Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...
3150051 3151260 not a magician.
3151468 3153885 He could predict fissures in time.
3154051 3155593 Fissures in time?
3156010 3159051 - Baz, you can't prove that!<br />- Well, not yet.
3159176 3161093 Proving it is what makes it science!
3176343 3177510 Oh, Baz.
3179218 3180760 I never should've given you the thing.
3181468 3183010 It belongs in a museum.
3183885 3185551 Give it to me. Please.
3189218 3190510 If I give you this...
3191718 3193260 it must be destroyed.
3194676 3195676 I will.
3198468 3199801 I'll destroy it, Baz.
3202385 3203385 Promise.
3209468 3211010 I'm sorry about this.
3211176 3212343 It's all my fault.
3214510 3215926 - Are you gonna be here?<br />- Yes, sir.
3216135 3218218 Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.
3218385 3221176 If anyone finds the Grafikos,<br />they'll have both halves.
3221343 3222635 Some things should stay buried.
3222760 3223551 I know, Baz.
3223718 3225518 - It's vital that you destroy it.<br />- I will, Baz.
3225676 3227116 - Do you understand?<br />- I'll destroy it.
3227218 3227968 - Say you will, Indy.<br />- Yes.
3228135 3229135 I will... Yes.
3229301 3230885 You promised me. Remember that.
3231051 3232051 I will... I promise.
3232218 3233218 There's a reason...
3233260 3235843 a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.
3236051 3237676 I know, Baz.
3237885 3238885 Indy.
3240718 3242093 Thanks, Wombat.
3242260 3244218 He's gonna be all right in a few days.
3246301 3247676 I'll call you as soon as I land.
3252760 3254010 Ladies and gentlemen...
3254176 3256635 we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.
3290385 3291785 - Stop drinking!<br />- What are you doing?
3291885 3293510 No more champagne! How many more...
3293635 3294635 I'm staying.
3294676 3296218 Go home. Go home!
3312843 3315218 Miss Shaw, she's here.
3319510 3320510 Forged in bronze.
3320676 3321718 Nearly complete.
3321885 3323551 It is an astrological clock.
3324135 3326385 Dating third century BC...
3326551 3330426 and built by Archimedes himself.
3332468 3333885 All right, let's start at 20,000.
3334093 3335213 20,000, thank you very much.
3335301 3336593 30.30.
3336801 3337801 Gauges green...
3338301 3339468 power full...
3339593 3341926 and when I reach 85, I rotate.
3342551 3343468 What next?
3343551 3345711 - Louis, help him! He's so cute.<br />- Pull back on the yoke.
3345801 3348051 - I did, man. I'm airborne.<br />- Yeah, he's airborne.
3348260 3349569 - Can I have a sip?<br />- Do I pick up the flaps?
3349593 3351593 Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.
3351760 3353468 Decrease your pitch to get to 120.
3353593 3354593 All right.
3357176 3359426 - Private auction, old timer.<br />- I've gotta get in there.
3359551 3362135 No password, no entry.<br />I don't make the rules.
3364926 3366777 - And what is the current bid?<br />- The bid is 50,000.
3366801 3368135 Then I bid 55.
3369093 3370093 - Who'll give me 60?<br />- 60.
3370260 3371676 60.65?
3371843 3373051 - 65.70?<br />- 75.
3373260 3374510 - 75.80?<br />- 80.
3374635 3376260 - 85.<br />- How about 90?
3383260 3384260 This auction is private.
3384426 3385510 This auction's over.
3385926 3387260 Au contraire, it's hardly begun.
3387385 3388760 - 100.<br />- 100,000.
3388968 3390510 I like the hat, by the way.
3390635 3392111 Makes you look at least two years younger.
3392135 3393218 Thanks.
3393385 3395111 - 110, bravo.<br />- I told you that this auction is over.
3395135 3396426 Excuse me, who is this man?
3396551 3398069 - I'm her godfather.<br />- He's mildly related.
3398093 3400010 And she's up past her bedtime.
3400176 3401527 - Come on, Wombat.<br />- I wouldn't do that.
3401551 3403194 You want to explain it to the cops<br />at the bar?
3403218 3404551 The ones I paid off?
3405093 3406676 You're out of your depth, Jonesy.
3406843 3408283 - "Jonesy"?<br />- He thinks I'm a criminal.
3408343 3410135 He's the one wanted for murder.
3410260 3412301 Nice big picture in the<br />New York Herald. 130?
3412468 3414135 I didn't kill anyone.
3414301 3416661 - No entry, it's a private auction.<br />- And you know it, Helena.
3416885 3420135 But whoever did was looking for this.
3420718 3422635 What you've got here is Pandora's Box.
3423843 3425093 No, actually.
3425926 3427468 It's my box.
3430051 3431051 You.
3432760 3433885 Have we met?
3434218 3435093 No.
3435218 3436551 My memory is a little fuzzy...
3436718 3438468 but your face rings a bell.
3439135 3440176 Are you still a Nazi?
3444260 3446426 You're confused. My name is Schmidt.
3446926 3449135 Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.
3450843 3451843 Professor Schmidt.
3452218 3453458 How nice to meet you in person.
3454260 3455940 - 150.<br />- After our conversation, Miss Shaw...
3456093 3458093 I thought we'd come to an agreement<br />about the Dial.
3458218 3460527 Funny. The last time I saw the other guy<br />who looks like you...
3460551 3462343 he was also after this.
3462926 3464646 Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.
3464676 3465944 But good news is, you're here now.
3465968 3468468 - The bid is 160.<br />- You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.
3468551 3469801 This relic is my property.
3470010 3471551 It's not yours. You stole it.
3471676 3472468 Then you stole it.
3472593 3474313 And then I stole it.<br />It's called capitalism.
3474385 3475385 The bid is 160.
3475426 3476426 - 160.<br />- 170?
3476468 3477527 You should've stayed in New York.
3477551 3479426 - 170?<br />- You should've stayed out of Poland.
3479593 3481426 170. Anyone? Anyone?
3481593 3482885 Going, going...
3483426 3484426 Gone!
3484885 3485885 Stay away!
3487593 3488593 Get the Dial.
3493510 3494510 Stay away!
3503593 3504593 Oh, hello, Claude.
3504676 3506196 You should not have come back, Helena.
3515176 3516468 Get back.
3527301 3528301 Teddy!
3542510 3543593 Rahim says you stay.
3555593 3556593 Thank you.
3569551 3570926 See you in the past, Dr. Jones.
3578968 3580718 Move! Get out of the way!
3598010 3599010 It's my cab!
3604551 3605718 Tell them to back off.
3605885 3607260 I just told them to shoot you.
3609343 3610510 All right, guys.
3611926 3613343 Put the guns down.
3613468 3614635 Put 'em down.
3616760 3617760 All right.
3619343 3620635 That's better.
3624510 3626093 Oh, dear.
3636176 3637301 Rahim.
3638343 3639801 You're in pajamas.
3640385 3642093 I was sleeping, Helena.
3642510 3643510 Peacefully.
3644385 3646218 Then my father woke me.
3646385 3648926 He told me you'd returned to our hotel.
3650510 3652718 Then he handed me this scimitar...
3652885 3655718 and told me to come home with your head.
3657510 3658843 Does it have to be that bit?
3666551 3669426 I thought maybe you returned<br />because you loved me.
3669551 3670635 Rahim...
3671468 3673010 I had an item to sell.
3673176 3675051 Excuse me. The item she's talking about...
3675218 3676986 - actually belongs to me.<br />- No. You do not need to...
3677010 3678236 - And some very bad people...<br />- ...intrude in this conversation.
3678260 3680527 - ...worse people, have run off with it.<br />- You do not need to get involved...
3680551 3681611 - with my business.<br />- Is this your new man?
3681635 3682926 - No. No, no.<br />- It's complicated.
3684635 3686218 What exactly do you owe this guy?
3686343 3688426 Just some bail money<br />and a lifetime of happiness.
3688551 3690301 I presume you sold the ring.
3690426 3692236 It didn't go for as much<br />as I thought it would.
3692260 3693301 I'll do it!
3693468 3694510 What are you... Hey!
3700760 3702260 You just got me killed!
3702468 3705010 Well, I'm not the one that's engaged<br />to a mobster!
3705176 3708135 I don't need morality lessons<br />from an aging grave robber!
3708260 3709468 I'm not a grave robber.
3709593 3711926 Your father and I<br />did important work together.
3714343 3716652 Don't tell me all your escapades<br />were noble, selfless quests.
3716676 3717676 You did it for the buzz!
3720343 3721385 Oh, good work, Teddy!
3722801 3724551 - Move over, kid.<br />- Hey!
3735218 3737135 - Helena!<br />- Back up! Back up!
3754801 3755801 Not this way!
3755843 3757277 You don't know where you're going, Indy!
3757301 3759341 - Listen to him. He knows this town!<br />- I know Tangier!
3763593 3764635 There he is!
3769760 3771885 Faster. Go faster!
3772093 3774051 Ten minutes to the airport, boss.
3776010 3778718 I'm not sure Professor Schmidt<br />is an actual professor, by the way.
3778885 3780010 - He's a Nazi!<br />- Turn left!
3780176 3781718 Turn left! Turn left!
3781885 3782968 - Oh, no!<br />- No!
3797635 3799593 Helena! Don't do this!
3807510 3809135 - Hey, this way!<br />- That way!
3810093 3811093 No!
3812051 3813510 Helena!
3815510 3816510 No!
3826260 3827801 What the hell?
3834426 3835635 Helena!
3837593 3838468 Hey!
3838593 3839593 Hey!
3840135 3841135 What the hell?
3844426 3845468 Come on!
3849218 3851051 Come on. Come on!
3884885 3887510 You think he'd be proud of this?
3887635 3888635 Who?
3890385 3891218 Your father!
3891385 3894301 His only daughter selling her soul<br />for bail money!
3894468 3895902 Sounds quite cool<br />when you put it like that.
3895926 3897593 And it's not all bail money.
3897718 3900051 - Some of it's gambling debt and some...<br />- Thank you, Teddy.
3900218 3901885 Helena!<br />No!
3902093 3903093 Helena!
3904801 3906676 How did you end up like this?
3906843 3908176 Well, you mean resourceful?
3908343 3910635 Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?
3935968 3936968 Hold on!
3940510 3941510 Go this way!
3951051 3952051 There he is.
3964551 3966926 - Stop! Stop!<br />- Hey! Hey!
3979676 3980843 On the left!
3981968 3982968 Take the wheel, Teddy!
3985218 3986260 What are you doing?
3986385 3987926 Getting what's mine.
3988885 3989885 Helena!
3994135 3995635 Damn it! You crazy?
3998301 4000176 Hey! Helena!
4004135 4005760 - Take the gun!<br />- Miss Shaw.
4007176 4008843 Let go, Miss Shaw!
4031676 4032676 Let go.
4032760 4035176 Come on! Give me the Dial!
4036593 4037926 Helena!
4039801 4040801 Damn.
4047551 4049635 - Turn back! They went that way!<br />- He's gone!
4049801 4051635 - Move over!<br />- Hey!
4055051 4058135 I didn't come here to rescue you<br />from your fiancé!
4058260 4059260 Rescue me?
4064301 4065843 I just want the Dial back.
4085301 4086801 Put your hands above your head.
4088093 4089611 Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.
4089635 4091875 - If your father was still alive...<br />- Well, he's not, Indy.
4092093 4093569 Hey, something's wrong with the engine.
4093593 4095736 If only there'd been someone there for me,<br />some father figure...
4095760 4098635 someone specifically anointed for the job.
4098760 4101194 - You have no idea about the kind...<br />- Don't beat yourself up about it.
4101218 4103301 I mean, what even is a godfather?
4104301 4106343 Anyway, family never was your strong suit.
4107051 4109343 - What is the time, by the way?<br />- It's...
4109510 4110510 Hey, no fair.
4111260 4112260 Give me that back.
4112343 4113510 That was my father's watch!
4116135 4117135 Give it back to him.
4121468 4122986 You're gonna have to leave town with me.
4123010 4124551 Rahim will be looking for you too.
4124676 4126027 They'll go to Tangier airport first...
4126051 4128531 so we'll need to catch a train<br />and get a plane from Casablanca.
4130385 4131385 What was that?
4136510 4137510 Damn.
4139760 4140843 Yeah.
4141093 4142093 I know, sir.
4144343 4145343 Yes...
4146551 4147551 Copy.
4152635 4153760 They pulled the plug.
4154010 4155385 You got them scared.
4155760 4157426 - Because they don't understand.<br />- No.
4157551 4160051 Because your associates killed<br />three American civilians...
4160218 4162426 and blew up a nationally televised parade.
4162551 4165510 Because you stood up<br />the President of the United States...
4165676 4166843 ran to Morocco...
4167093 4169468 and created an incident<br />that required military extraction!
4171551 4173351 Then take me to DC,<br />and I will explain it all.
4173468 4174760 They want you to vanish.
4174885 4177051 We have half the Dial now.
4177218 4178898 They were just trying to keep you happy...
4179551 4181218 letting you chase that thing.
4181385 4182551 They never cared about it.
4182760 4185301 They will, Miss Mason,<br />when they understand what it can do.
4185468 4186551 You put them on the moon.
4187301 4188510 They got what they wanted.
4189801 4191718 All right, buckle up.<br />We're landing in Spain.
4192426 4194426 C-9 transport will take you<br />from there to Maxwell.
4194551 4196010 I'm not going back to Alabama!
4196218 4198468 All we need is a vessel to take us<br />to the Mediterranean.
4199093 4200611 The Grafikos will take us to the other...
4200635 4202676 Please, Miss Mason. Please.
4202843 4203885 Let go of me, Schmidt.
4204051 4205676 I'm asking you personally.
4206593 4208051 You're a piece of work, Doc.
4209718 4210718 Hey!
4238510 4240093 Schmidt...
4240968 4242551 My name is Voller.
4245426 4246718 Jürgen Voller.
4260051 4261801 That's a Sea Stallion.
4261968 4263385 American helicopter.
4264385 4266135 Did you know the Wright Brothers?
4266510 4268051 - What?<br />- The Wright Brothers.
4268218 4269301 Orville and Wilbur.
4269468 4271676 They invented the airplane,<br />and they lived in Indiana.
4271801 4273426 Wilbur was born in Indiana.
4273551 4275926 I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.
4276135 4278676 And the Wright Brothers were born<br />during the Civil War.
4278843 4280968 Oh, I thought maybe you went to school<br />with them.
4282385 4284843 Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.
4285051 4286051 "Funny"?
4286968 4290635 I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk<br />and two thieves.
4290801 4292051 I'm wanted for murder.
4292218 4294176 Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...
4294343 4295676 and your father's notebooks.
4296885 4298093 I have a copy.
4298885 4300385 Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.
4300551 4301551 Where?
4302510 4304426 You memorized five notebooks?
4304593 4305801 Seven. And of course not.
4305968 4307608 Half of them were as dull as ditch water.
4308468 4310885 Just the really important bits.
4311885 4312885 Like what?
4313260 4314420 The location of the Grafikos.
4314510 4316260 Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.
4316426 4317676 - Dad did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4317843 4319093 - Yes, he did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4319260 4320801 - Yes, he did.<br />- What's a Grafikos?
4321010 4322486 It's directions to the rest of the Dial.
4322510 4324194 Ask her if she knows what language it's in.
4324218 4326051 It isn't in a language. It's in a code.
4326218 4327468 What code?
4327593 4329051 Archimedes used two codes.
4329218 4330760 Linear B and Polybius Square.
4330926 4334301 So, even if you find the Grafikos,<br />without me, you can't read it.
4334801 4336135 Please.
4336260 4338135 Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.
4338301 4340027 Used to leave little<br />notes around the house.
4340051 4341051 "Tidy your room."
4341135 4342426 "Stay away from my brandy."
4343551 4344551 What if it's Linear B?
4345551 4346843 50 quid it's Polybius.
4347885 4349051 Give me that.
4349218 4350218 Hey.
4350551 4351760 That won't work.
4351885 4354176 Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap<br />of the Manilkara.
4354343 4355635 Heat resistant.
4357135 4358343 Try and start it.
4363301 4364426 - Start it.<br />- I am.
4366510 4368135 Huh? Huh?
4368760 4370426 - Huh?<br />- It won't hold.
4370551 4372510 It'll get us to the train station.
4372635 4373760 "Us"?
4373885 4375135 - You goin' home?<br />- No.
4375343 4377093 I'm going to Casablanca.
4377260 4379051 Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.
4379218 4380218 Just like you.
4380551 4382194 What makes you think<br />we're going to the Aegean?
4382218 4385301 You gotta get to the Grafikos<br />before the Nazis.
4385468 4387510 Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.
4388301 4389468 Where else would it be?
4389593 4390593 The Aegean is huge, Indy.
4390760 4392000 And you don't have coordinates.
4392135 4393593 And you don't have a boat.
4396551 4398926 I've got an old friend in Greece.
4399135 4400551 An expert diver.
4400676 4402551 With a big, beautiful boat...
4402676 4404718 that'll get us there before they will.
4405593 4407635 You need me...
4407801 4409051 and you know it.
4459093 4460301 Renny!
4462385 4463385 Indy?
4464301 4465343 Indy!
4470718 4472676 So, that's the expert diver?
4472843 4475093 Spain's greatest frogman.
4478051 4478885 Hey!
4479051 4482468 So, Spain's greatest frogman has a<br />shit boat and only one good frog leg?
4482676 4483718 Stop it.
4487551 4488843 You got a different boat.
4489051 4490051 Stop it.
4504260 4505301 We're going here.
4506926 4509385 Where they found the first part<br />of the Antikythera.
4510301 4511301 But...
4512801 4514135 we're going deeper.
4515635 4519426 Dad tracked down the old sponge diver<br />who found the Dial.
4519551 4520676 He told him...
4520843 4523801 that the wrecked Roman ship broke up<br />under the sea...
4524010 4525135 70 feet below.
4525343 4528260 Filled with the skeletons<br />of over 100 centurions.
4529468 4530593 That's where they found it.
4532218 4535260 But he said that most of the ship<br />had broken off...
4535426 4537218 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4538176 4539676 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540718 4543551 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship...
4543718 4547176 would sail out of Syracuse<br />with 100 centurions on board.
4550801 4554218 They weren't taking half a Dial<br />for a joyride.
4558093 4559593 They had the Grafikos...
4562468 4564635 and they were looking<br />for the rest of the Dial.
4568010 4569551 Your dad was a genius.
4570260 4571260 Yeah.
4572676 4573676 He was.
4593510 4594551 Seven of spades.
4597801 4598885 How do you do that?
4599093 4600135 Wow.
4600968 4601968 Do it again.
4605801 4607676 Pick a card, Dr. Jones.
4615218 4616343 Seven of spades!
4618468 4619510 She's magic.
4619593 4620760 Trick deck.
4620968 4621968 No.
4623135 4624551 I force the card.
4624718 4626010 I offer the mark...
4626176 4627385 you...
4627510 4628550 the feeling of a choice...
4628676 4630885 but ultimately,<br />I make you pick the card I want.
4633051 4634176 "The mark."
4637260 4639176 Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.
4639343 4641135 I have to check the lines.
4647093 4648218 Good night.
4651343 4654468 You remember seeing any dates<br />in your father's notebooks?
4655760 4657135 Dates?
4657301 4658551 What dates?
4659468 4660468 These dates.
4664260 4666635 Written over and over again in this letter.
4668135 4669885 August 20th, 1969.
4670135 4671635 That's three days from now.
4671760 4674051 And the same date in 1939.
4674260 4676635 Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.
4679093 4680093 Wait.
4680843 4683176 Now you believe the<br />Dial has magical powers?
4684468 4686468 I don't believe in magic, Wombat.
4688385 4690718 But a few times in my<br />life, I've seen things.
4693843 4695593 Things I can't explain.
4696968 4699385 And I've come to<br />believe it's not so much...
4699510 4701635 what you believe.
4701801 4704051 It's how hard you believe it.
4707176 4708468 I've seen things too, Indy.
4709426 4712010 The only thing worth believing in, ever...
4712176 4713760 is cash.
4716135 4717218 Right.
4722968 4724328 What if you could go back in time?
4726468 4727510 What would you do?
4728843 4730260 Witness the Trojan War?
4731551 4732885 Check in on Cleopatra?
4736468 4738593 I'd stop my son from enlisting.
4741760 4743510 Did he sign up to please you?
4744551 4746760 No, he signed up to piss me off.
4750510 4752676 How would you have stopped him?
4756843 4758676 I'd tell him he was gonna die.
4765676 4767551 I'd tell him that his mother would...
4770260 4772051 find no end to her grief.
4773843 4775635 And that his father would be...
4778510 4780385 helpless to console her.
4783676 4786218 And that the loss would put an end<br />to their marriage.
4800176 4801426 You're still wearing the ring.
4824760 4825760 Promising.
4834176 4835551 More promising.
4841426 4842468 Hello.
4844635 4846635 Get your gear on. They're waiting.
4851343 4852343 Hey.
4853426 4854426 Come here.
4855218 4856635 Okay.
4856801 4857593 I'm gonna show you something.
4857760 4859676 Gosh, this looks important.
4863010 4863760 Around the rope...
4864010 4866176 Now, we are going deep.
4866343 4869176 Descend fast,<br />and breathe through these hoses.
4869343 4870343 Okay?
4870593 4872176 Stay separate.
4872343 4874301 No crisscross. All right?
4874468 4875593 We cannot stay long.
4875760 4879093 I have a method<br />that usually prevents the bends.
4880093 4881135 - Usually?<br />- Yeah.
4881301 4882468 I call it "the bounce."
4882676 4883676 You know, fast down...
4883843 4885760 three minutes on the bottom, and then up.
4885926 4887010 Three minutes!
4887176 4889010 No one more second.
4889593 4890593 Three minutes.
4891010 4892010 Yeah, that's right.
4892093 4893853 - Where is my lighter?<br />- I don't know, capitán.
4895135 4896135 We have to go.
4898843 4899843 Quick question.
4900010 4901385 What's that?
4901510 4902801 - They're sharks?<br />- No.
4902968 4905343 No, no. No sharks here. Eels.
4906426 4907426 Eels?
4907468 4908718 Anguilas.
4908885 4909885 Most are small.
4910010 4911510 Sometimes they are big. Two meters.
4911676 4913718 But if you see them, stay still.
4913926 4917176 They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.
4917343 4918676 They look like snakes.
4919551 4920551 No, they don't.
4921010 4922676 Private Brandy reporting for duty.
4923343 4924343 You're not coming, Teddy?
4924885 4926051 I can't swim.
4926218 4927385 Lucky him.
4927510 4928801 Everyone can swim.
4930676 4932635 Reach and pull. Reach and pull.
4934676 4936926 All right. You stay here with Hector<br />and watch our lines.
4940718 4942010 It is time, camarada.
5050343 5051343 Two minutes?
5142551 5143551 I got it.
5184385 5185385 Hey.
5217301 5218301 Hurry up!
5233218 5234718 Helena!
5243593 5244510 Come on.
5244593 5246218 That's it. That's it. That's it.
5247010 5248260 That's it.
5271385 5272593 Who are these people?
5275051 5275843 Nazis.
5276051 5278510 First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...
5278676 5281801 and now, you bring me the Grafikos.
5282718 5284885 I'm very happy you're not wasting<br />in retirement.
5285260 5287593 I should have retired you<br />when I had the chance.
5287801 5288926 Where are your sponsors?
5289135 5290635 I'm on my own now.
5290801 5292510 Things move forward, Dr. Jones.
5292676 5293676 And sometimes...
5295510 5297301 they go backward.
5300510 5302760 Now, let's get comfortable<br />and have a little talk.
5329801 5331176 What language is that?
5331343 5332926 It's not a language.
5334176 5335260 It's a code.
5336218 5337218 Polybius.
5337926 5339260 You owe me 50 quid.
5341510 5343385 Not familiar with Polybius cipher?
5343510 5344510 No.
5345301 5346635 But it appears you are.
5351051 5352051 Read it, please.
5360426 5361426 No.
5367176 5368176 Indy...
5379218 5380510 Feeling helpful now?
5383926 5384926 I am.
5387926 5389218 I know this stuff backwards.
5389343 5390343 No!
5392135 5393135 Sorry, Indy.
5393468 5394760 I don't do noble death.
5395510 5396551 Just...
5396676 5398135 cold, hard maths.
5398676 5400516 I crack the code,<br />help you find the other half.
5401885 5403593 One hundred grand. Cash.
5403760 5404760 Helena...
5405385 5406385 Take it or leave it.
5407885 5408926 You have a deal.
5422510 5424260 He'll never pay you.
5425760 5428635 I think you will find this is worth<br />more than your asking price.
5438176 5439593 - Teddy.<br />- Helena...
5439760 5441010 don't do this.
5446426 5447760 Let's see what we've got here.
5449968 5451385 "My Makhana..."
5452010 5453010 That's "machine"...
5454093 5457635 "lies with me, in the city I left.
5457801 5460176 "Where wolves teach men to walk."
5460343 5464468 "Under one of nine, I lie."
5467343 5469051 Only one thing lies anywhere forever.
5469218 5471843 The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,<br />then...
5473718 5475301 then this is directions to his tomb.
5475760 5477093 The Tomb of Archimedes?
5478510 5480301 Undiscovered for two millennia.
5483385 5485468 "The city I left."
5486135 5489510 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life, so he only left one.
5490426 5492468 Anyone? At the back?
5493343 5494801 Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.
5495010 5495801 Even this clown.
5496010 5497385 Alexandria.
5497510 5498551 Full marks.
5499760 5501968 Now, "wolf" in Greek is "lycos."
5502135 5504385 Root of the word "lycaeum" or "school."
5504551 5507176 And the Doric for "walking" is...
5508551 5509551 "peripatio."
5510718 5513468 Which also happens to be the word for...
5518676 5520635 I thought you were a bright spark.
5523301 5526426 "Peripatio" means "walking"...
5526551 5528968 but it also means "counting."
5529135 5532260 So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...
5533051 5535301 - could be...<br />- The School of Mathematics.
5536593 5538260 Is correct.
5538385 5539926 Now, the next bit is easy.
5541260 5542760 "Beneath one of nine"?
5543968 5545343 There are nine Muses.
5545510 5546593 The Museon.
5546718 5549260 The Greek word<br />for the Great Library of Alexandria.
5549426 5553176 Which, as we all know, has nine statues<br />supporting its roof.
5553343 5554343 May I?
5555510 5556510 Thank you.
5557801 5560510 The nine Muses, in reverse order...
5562051 5563468 are Calliope...
5564426 5565426 Urania...
5566801 5567843 Polymnia...
5568801 5570426 - Erato...<br />- Polymnia.
5570593 5572968 ...and Meli whasisname...
5573510 5574510 that other one...
5575218 5576218 Thalia...
5576843 5578051 Euteroe...
5578218 5580301 but the first is...
5580718 5581718 Clio.
5583385 5584545 The Muse of history and time.
5584718 5585926 That Archimedes...
5586135 5587402 - what a clever bugger.<br />- The entrance...
5587426 5589510 to the tomb<br />is by the School of Mathematics...
5589676 5591426 under a statue of Clio...
5591551 5594385 in the ruins<br />of the Great Library of Alexandria.
5594510 5595760 Gold star for Dr. Brains.
5597385 5598385 Teddy!
5608218 5609676 The Grafikos, get it!
5637301 5640051 I have said it before,<br />and I will say it again!
5640218 5642760 When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.
5644551 5646135 My friend was just murdered.
5651593 5652593 Sorry.
5652760 5654510 You told them everything.
5656218 5657301 Word for word.
5657926 5659843 But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.
5660593 5662510 The tomb isn't in Alexandria.
5671593 5672593 Go!
5676093 5677093 So, what do you see?
5677718 5679510 Polybius square.
5680051 5681176 Made of?
5683718 5684926 Wax and wood.
5686510 5687801 Anything else?
5691426 5692426 It's heavy.
5695343 5696468 Too heavy.
5698551 5699676 Give me that.
5739801 5741510 This is solid gold?
5741676 5742885 Ancient gold.
5744468 5745468 From the Nile.
5747176 5748176 Hold it, Teddy.
5759551 5760635 Sell this thing...
5760843 5762483 and we are out of the hole and then some.
5762635 5763635 I have just the customer.
5763718 5766718 - Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...<br />- This is going in a museum.
5770093 5771385 Take the wheel, Teddy.
5778218 5779218 What does it say?
5781343 5784218 "Search where Dionysius...
5785051 5787718 "hears each whisper..."
5788551 5790593 "like a hurricane."
5793510 5794843 The Ear.
5795593 5797426 The cave of Dionysius.
5798301 5799301 Where is that?
5800676 5801718 In Sicily.
5803218 5805301 - How much fuel have we got?<br />- It's full.
5814343 5815343 They're heading west.
5816635 5817635 Not east.
5846593 5847593 I want the papaya.
5847676 5848718 How much is it?
5852176 5853176 Take this.
5855926 5858093 Look at that kid with the straw hat.
5859260 5860260 This way.
5863343 5864343 Hey.
5865760 5867051 What do you think?
5874051 5875343 What are we doing?
5876885 5878593 Waiting for closing time at the caves.
5878760 5880260 It's crawling with tourists.
5880426 5882843 Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?
5884218 5885593 He's not running the show, Teddy.
5887051 5890176 I just thought we were in this<br />for all the wrong reasons.
5890676 5891843 We are.
5895426 5896426 Most assuredly.
5896468 5899260 You know he's never gonna let us sell<br />any of that stuff.
5900718 5902426 I'm still in charge, Teddy.
5902551 5904551 Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!
5910468 5911551 You splurged.
5912926 5913926 Here's your backpack.
5914093 5915093 Where's the kid?
5929010 5930051 Hey, watch it!
5930676 5931926 What's wrong with you?
5960426 5961551 Hello.
5963218 5964218 Hey.
5967176 5968176 Let me go!
5969343 5970385 Let me go!
5978135 5980343 Get off me! Let me go!
5984051 5985051 Hey, hey, hey!
5996051 5997176 Helena!
5998510 5999968 They've got Teddy.
6002051 6003635 They took him up the hill somewhere.
6023718 6024918 What are they gonna do to him?
6024968 6027635 He knows about the Ear,<br />what the Grafikos says.
6029010 6030510 They're not gonna hurt him.
6030635 6031801 They're gonna use him...
6032510 6034801 to get the other half of the Dial.
6035010 6036343 We gotta get there first.
6049093 6053135 Colonizing queens built many cities<br />in Sicily.
6053301 6054801 - The temple...<br />- Let's go.
6055510 6058051 ...is the oldest of the Greek temples.
6059135 6060468 The cave's over there.
6070801 6072593 Could we go a little faster, please?
6081801 6083260 The Ear of Dionysius.
6091010 6092010 Wow.
6106176 6109676 "Search where Dionysius hears each whisper<br />like a hurricane."
6110885 6111885 That's some echo.
6113593 6116260 Keep making noise till we find out<br />where it's loudest.
6133635 6134635 Stop.
6142426 6143510 This is it.
6148510 6149510 Greek pediment.
6150635 6151635 An entrance.
6153051 6154051 Used to be.
6157343 6158343 A crescent.
6161218 6162301 Just like on the Grafikos.
6169843 6171676 I think there's an opening up there.
6178510 6179510 You okay up there?
6180510 6181510 Yes.
6184176 6185218 You're not moving.
6187676 6188926 I'm thinking.
6191843 6192843 About?
6193885 6196801 About what the hell I'm doing up here,<br />40 feet in the air...
6197218 6198718 with crap shoulders...
6198885 6200718 crumbling vertebrae...
6200843 6203426 a plate in one leg, screws in the other.
6203551 6204801 Yeah, I get it. I get it.
6205426 6206551 No, you don't get it.
6207385 6208551 You're half my age.
6209593 6212301 You haven't been forced<br />to drink the blood of Kali.
6212468 6213676 No. Fair enough.
6214510 6216343 Or been tortured with voodoo.
6217635 6220468 And I'm just guessing, but I don't think<br />you've been shot nine times...
6220593 6223051 including once by your father.
6224760 6226135 Dad shot you?
6226843 6228010 Don't talk to me.
6228176 6229416 Just go ahead. I'll follow you.
6238135 6239135 No, no, no.
6239176 6240635 We are close. We are close.
6240801 6241801 Look around you.
6242051 6243531 - We are close.<br />- The Cave of Dionysius.
6243635 6244510 No, no, no.
6244593 6246551 The cave is closed for renovation.
6248635 6249635 Let me ask again.
6249760 6251676 Where is the Cave of Dionysius?
6271343 6273510 What's the matter? You<br />worried about the kid?
6274760 6276468 Are you sure they won't hurt him?
6276593 6277801 He'll be fine.
6277968 6279010 He's smart.
6280885 6282260 Where'd you find him?
6284010 6288593 He tried to steal my purse outside a casino<br />in Marrakesh when he was 10.
6288760 6290593 I hit him repeatedly with my car door...
6290760 6293343 but he didn't let go and neither did I.
6293510 6295010 So, been together ever since.
6296176 6298093 Thought you were all about the money.
6299260 6300260 I am.
6303301 6307343 Nobody memorizes every page<br />of their dead father's notebooks...
6307468 6308551 for the money.
6315260 6316260 Herr Voller!
6326843 6328218 They went that way.
6338510 6339551 Why?
6343510 6345385 Come on, come on.
6348093 6349093 Let's go.
6353843 6354843 Oh, my...
6357760 6359260 Oh, my God!
6360135 6361426 Oh, my God!
6361593 6363051 - Oh, God!<br />- No, no.
6363926 6365343 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
6369801 6370843 Are they off me?
6371051 6371843 - Get 'em off!<br />- No, no.
6372051 6373260 - Get 'em off!<br />- Wait.
6386260 6387260 What is that?
6390343 6391385 Methane.
6392801 6394093 Don't breathe.
6394260 6395260 Don't breathe?
6398885 6400343 We've gotta get outta here.
6409218 6410218 Athena.
6411885 6413218 Goddess of war.
6416093 6417301 And reason.
6421551 6422885 "Under the moon..."
6425218 6427218 "life lies at her feet."
6435010 6436301 Water displacement.
6437135 6438426 Get in the pool!
6438551 6440551 Why? Help me open the door.
6440718 6442468 Well, they didn't get out the doors!
6442551 6443551 Get in the pool!
6444510 6446426 Okay, I'm getting in the pool.
6446551 6447676 Help me.
6450426 6452468 Archimedes was fascinated...
6453926 6455885 by water displacement!
6497051 6498260 Hey! Get back here!
6498426 6499426 Klaber!
6513343 6514468 You don't need to do that.
6540635 6541635 Hey!
6542676 6543676 Give me that!
6545510 6546510 No!
6553760 6555051 Leave them.
6555760 6557385 I said leave them.
6581801 6583343 Reach and pull.
6583468 6585135 Reach and pull.
6585260 6587426 Reach and pull.
6615801 6617426 Archimedes' tomb.
6646343 6647593 Grab that corner.
6693843 6694843 Indy.
6697218 6698551 This frieze...
6701218 6702510 It's a phoenix.
6702635 6703635 A common icon.
6703801 6705385 No. Look, it isn't.
6707010 6708676 This phoenix has propellers.
6717510 6719051 What's this doing here?
6727801 6730801 Clocks won't be invented<br />for 1,000 years...
6731468 6732926 much less watches.
6735468 6736635 Archimedes used it.
6740260 6741551 Dad was right.
6742385 6743218 It works.
6743385 6744968 Of course it works, Miss Shaw.
6747676 6748885 Mathematics works.
6750051 6753051 As it conquered space,<br />it will conquer time.
6760926 6762843 You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.
6763051 6764051 Your wife is gone.
6764135 6766051 Do you really want to lose your godchild?
6769135 6770218 For what?
6770593 6772718 A world that no longer cares<br />about men like us.
6784260 6785260 Thank you.
6823718 6825135 History's greatest moment.
6832218 6833468 Its end.
6841301 6842301 Throw me the gun!
6852551 6853801 Get him outta here.
6853968 6854968 Teddy.
6855843 6857010 Teddy! Teddy!
6857135 6858218 Come on! Go!
6858385 6859385 This way. Come on.
6863343 6864343 Go!
6868593 6869593 Indy!
6871510 6872635 Go!
6872760 6874051 Go!
6874260 6875343 Stop!
6878676 6880093 Now what?
6881718 6882718 Bring him.
6890760 6891760 Helena, come on!
6892010 6893486 - Teddy, we can't just leave him.<br />- We're not!
6893510 6894635 Follow me!
6896635 6897635 Come on!
6901551 6902551 Come on.
6916760 6918718 Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.
6923676 6924676 Crap.
6930843 6931885 Stay there.
6950760 6951760 Hop on.
6955385 6958301 The first hemisphere sets the destination.
6959801 6963385 The second calculates the location<br />of the fissure...
6964593 6966468 in Alexandrine coordinates.
6967093 6969885 Have Messner transpose this<br />to longitude and latitude...
6970968 6972801 and transmit way points to the pilots.
6985010 6986468 Shortcut.
6990718 6995176 - You got coordinates for 37.07.<br />- So, who is it?
6995843 6997176 Churchill?
6998510 6999510 Ike?
7001801 7004301 Who are you gonna kill to win the war?
7005135 7008051 In a few minutes,<br />with the help of Archimedes...
7008176 7010093 we shall fly into the eye of this storm...
7010843 7013135 and cross into Sicilian airspace...
7013301 7016718 on August 20th, 1939.
7017468 7021051 We will head north over friendly skies<br />with enough fuel to reach Munich.
7022385 7023968 My quarry will be waiting for me...
7024135 7026968 at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...
7027385 7029551 for an update on his V-1 rocket.
7036510 7040468 What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?
7042176 7044760 The kind that believes<br />in victory, Dr. Jones.
7050051 7053885 Hitler lit a fire that could have burned<br />1,000 years.
7054051 7055551 I saw every mistake.
7056343 7057635 Every blunder.
7057801 7059468 And I will correct them all.
7059593 7062260 History is a long list<br />of losses, Dr. Jones.
7063301 7064510 It's just a question of whose.
7077218 7078218 Stop!
7151343 7152343 Teddy.
7153968 7155368 You think you can fly one of those?
7157135 7158135 A Nord?
7160718 7161718 Sure.
7162426 7163546 It's not a ringing response.
7163676 7165385 Well, I haven't flown a Nord.
7165468 7167093 You've never flown any plane.
7168885 7170093 I'll get it started.
7170260 7171510 No, Teddy.
7172801 7173801 Crap.
7201010 7202593 Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.
7202760 7204093 There might be some turbulence.
7205051 7207468 You're German, Voller.
7207676 7209676 Don't try and be funny.
7233093 7234885 Come on, big talker.
7249801 7250801 Okay.
7267468 7269135 Okay. Okay.
7269301 7271760 Gauges green. Power full.
7272510 7274968 And when I reach 85, I rotate.
7312635 7314135 Okay, wings down.
7316218 7318218 Okay, 84 miles an hour.
7318593 7319593 Rotate.
7387426 7388718 Time to destination?
7390010 7391468 60 seconds.
7396801 7398343 Continental drift.
7401718 7402885 Continental drift!
7404676 7407260 Archimedes didn't know<br />about continental drift.
7408093 7409343 He couldn't have!
7410343 7412260 It hadn't been observed yet.
7413301 7415093 You're off target.
7415468 7417426 Your coordinates are based on markers...
7418176 7421385 that have been moving for 2000 years!
7421510 7424885 You could be off by 10 degrees, by...
7439885 7441468 30 seconds.
7442676 7443510 Herr Voller...
7443676 7446468 Your calculations are wrong!
7447010 7448330 - Herr Voller...<br />- Will you shut up?
7448801 7449801 I'm thinking!
7452801 7453801 20 seconds.
7456468 7457593 Hold the flight path!
7459551 7460885 15 seconds.
7464426 7465986 I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.
7466093 7467093 10 seconds.
7467760 7468510 9!
7468593 7470093 - But it sure as hell...<br />- 8!
7470635 7472176 - 7!<br />- ...ain't 1939!
7472260 7473010 6!
7473093 7474385 Turn around!
7475051 7476051 Abort!
7476468 7477468 Turn around!
7478135 7479135 ABORT!!!
7479260 7481218 We're being pulled in!
7491260 7492510 What are you doing?!
7492718 7493718 This is my plane!
7493885 7495301 You're flying my plane!
7520093 7521260 We're going to DIE!!!
7522551 7524301 We need to pull up!
7546135 7547301 Restart engines!
7575885 7577010 That's Sicily.
7577176 7578426 1939.
7580135 7581551 I did it.
7581718 7583218 I did it, Dr. Jones!
7583385 7585135 Setting coordinates for Munich.
7592093 7594135 Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.
7618968 7621176 Those are Roman triremes.
7649385 7650551 Keep it in the air!
7670676 7671426 Master...
7671635 7674051 The Romans are getting closer.
7675801 7676801 They have dragons!
7681385 7682760 Amazing.
7692260 7693260 Open the door!
7698135 7699135 What are you doing?
7700093 7701801 What are you doing, you idiots?
7701968 7703760 They think we're a monster!
7710218 7711676 You have to turn around.
7711885 7713760 This is the Siege of Syracuse.
7714926 7716301 214 BC.
7716426 7717593 You got the wrong war.
7721426 7722426 Master...
7725635 7726843 Don't ride out there, Master!
7727510 7728676 The dragons!!
7738926 7742468 We must take down their dragons!
7749593 7750468 Boss!
7750593 7751593 Change course!
7751676 7753051 The portal closes in minutes!
7753510 7754510 I have to go back!
7754843 7756010 I can't be here!
7756176 7757260 I CAN'T STAY HERE!!
7757426 7758885 The plane won't make it!!
7788593 7789593 Get out of the way!
7795843 7798010 How do you like that, you savages?
7801051 7803801 Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!
7813843 7815926 What are you doing here?
7816135 7817593 Rescuing you!
7829176 7830176 Get him off!
7831426 7832468 Indy!
7838176 7839343 Parachute!
7842176 7843343 I got a parachute!
7844760 7845760 Hang on!
7849468 7850468 Let go!
7852635 7854051 Give me the parachute!
7860135 7862260 Grab it. Hang on!
7864635 7865635 Indy!
7892801 7894343 We're losing altitude!
7895551 7896551 We're going down!
7898426 7899968 I've lost control!
7918218 7920593 Hey, those are my friends.
7920760 7922801 Those are my friends. We need to help them!
7924010 7925593 Those are my friends!
7987426 7988760 Eureka.
8006010 8007010 He's trying to land.
8007051 8009051 Come on, Indy. Help me.
8009760 8011801 Get up. Yeah.
8012010 8014301 We need to get you out of here. Okay.
8016218 8017468 Help me. Sit up, okay?
8018385 8019551 Sit up. You need to help me.
8019718 8021635 I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.
8021760 8024510 This is incredible, Wombat.
8025051 8027010 Incredible.
8028551 8030260 Yeah, it very well is.
8030426 8032051 But we have to get you out of here.
8034135 8035260 My God.
8036926 8038760 We're witnessing history.
8045843 8047676 Reverse these numbers.
8047801 8048885 They'll get you home.
8050760 8051760 What?
8054510 8055718 I'm going to stay.
8056468 8058468 No. You're not serious.
8061301 8062343 Wow, you are serious.
8066426 8068176 Indy, you've been shot.
8068343 8069343 You're bleeding.
8069510 8071135 You can't stay here.
8071301 8072301 Yes, I can.
8072760 8073760 But for what?
8073885 8077510 For a long, painful death<br />with poultice and leeches?
8078510 8080635 I've imagined this, Wombat.
8081718 8083510 Studied it.
8083718 8085760 - All my life.<br />- Yeah.
8085926 8089051 And if you stay here,<br />you will muck it all up.
8089218 8090218 And die.
8090718 8092426 Please, get up.
8094176 8095343 Helena!
8095801 8096635 I did it!
8096760 8099135 Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!
8099343 8100801 Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.
8101010 8102611 - I need to get you into that plane, okay?<br />- No.
8102635 8103635 - We need to.<br />- No.
8103718 8105343 Get up. You can... We can!
8118510 8119510 Master!
8122010 8123760 We have to leave, Master.
8125468 8126468 It's him.
8135385 8137426 He's asking how far we've come.
8140801 8143551 Two thousand years.
8144260 8145426 We've come...
8145968 8148968 two thousand years.
8151343 8154468 But we didn't expect to meet...
8154968 8157468 the great...
8158051 8160093 Archimedes.
8165676 8166676 You...
8167801 8169218 were always...
8169801 8171135 going to...
8171635 8173301 meet me.
8174010 8175801 That dial is a forced deck.
8175968 8177448 It doesn't take us anywhere but here.
8177551 8178843 He built it to get help.
8179010 8181551 Well, we just scared off<br />the entire Roman Navy...
8181718 8182819 so I think we've helped enough.
8182843 8184468 Apologies, Archimedes.
8184676 8186051 I'm a fan...
8186260 8188301 but we need to leave. He's hurt.
8188426 8189426 Helena...
8189468 8190611 He can't keep that, by the way.
8190635 8191652 He needs to build his own one.
8191676 8193468 Helena, we need to go!
8193843 8196010 Indy, the window is closing!
8196218 8197343 We cannot get stuck here!
8198760 8199510 I want...
8199635 8200718 to stay...
8201093 8202843 with you.
8203010 8204968 No, no, no! Do not say yes!
8205551 8207801 You are a brilliant man...
8208093 8210093 a wise man...
8210551 8211926 a genius...
8212135 8212926 Helena...
8213135 8215426 a hero to your people.
8216176 8219635 But he can't help you.
8220718 8222510 This is your time.
8222635 8223385 This is your time.
8223510 8225510 He must be in his own time -
8225635 8226718 He needs to be in his.
8226843 8227843 His work is not done.
8228218 8229218 He needs to go home.
8229343 8230926 There is medicine at home.
8231093 8232885 He cannot die here. He can't.
8234510 8237385 Helena, get on the plane.
8240010 8241093 I'll be all right.
8242843 8244301 No, you won't.
8247218 8248885 I need to do this.
8250176 8251176 Me too.
8305593 8306593 Good morning.
8311343 8312676 How's the shoulder?
8315385 8317843 Better than my jaw.
8321510 8322510 Right.
8324510 8326010 You should've let me stay.
8326843 8328093 I couldn't do that.
8337135 8338135 Why not?
8340010 8342468 Well, for starters, you'd have changed<br />the course of history.
8346801 8348635 That's supposed to be a bad thing?
8352760 8354551 You're meant to be here, Indy.
8358426 8359426 Here.
8364468 8365551 For who?
8392843 8394510 Marion.
8395676 8396718 Hey.
8416135 8417135 Teddy.
8418593 8419593 Marion.
8422426 8423426 What are you doing?
8424843 8426051 Putting groceries away.
8428343 8431051 There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.
8432010 8434010 No. Really.
8438718 8441010 Someone told me you were back.
8448468 8450051 Are you back, Indy?
8451676 8453426 It was explosives...
8453551 8455676 and Indy was running,<br />Marion was running...
8455843 8458468 and suddenly the plane exploded.
8462260 8464301 Indy, you're up and about.
8465468 8466801 Yes, I am.
8468176 8469176 Yes.
8469551 8471635 Why don't we go and<br />get some ice cream, kids?
8471760 8473051 But Marion just bought some.
8473260 8474343 Oh, I know a better place.
8474510 8476676 You can never have too much ice cream,<br />can you?
8480551 8481551 See you later.
8484551 8487885 A British tar is a soaring soul
8488093 8490843 As free as a mountain bird
8491093 8492843 His energetic fist
8493093 8495510 Should be ready to resist...
8497385 8498635 That looks bad.
8500135 8501426 Does it hurt?
8503926 8505385 Everything hurts.
8508260 8509885 I know how that feels.
8516010 8518593 Well, where doesn't it hurt?
8526760 8527760 Here.
8528968 8530218 It doesn't hurt here.
8538468 8540051 And here.
8563551 8566010 Jabari, Alia, slow down!
8566176 8568301 Helena! Hurry up!
8568468 8571135 I scream, you scream...
8571301 8573010 Everybody, slow down.
8573093 8575551 -I scream, you scream<br />-I scream, I scream
8575718 8577468 We all scream for ice cream!
8577593 8578760 Slow down.
