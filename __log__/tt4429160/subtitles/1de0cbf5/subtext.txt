16000 18583 <i>This is Fairytale Island.</i>
19333 25625 <i>A magical land of princes and princess,<br />and witches and monsters.</i>
25708 30250 <i>Accidents from strange events<br />happen all the time.</i>
30333 33083 <i>That's when people call us.</i>
33166 38041 <i>The Fearless 7,<br />the greatest heroes on Fairytale Island.</i>
38125 40166 <i>Especially me, Merlin.</i>
40916 42958 <i>But everything changed</i>
43041 46666 <i>the day we defeated a dragon<br />and saved a princess.</i>
48333 52833 <i>We thought we'd saved a witch,<br />so we attacked her.</i>
52916 55166 <i>But we were wrong.</i>
56166 59708 <i>She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.</i>
59791 62041 <i>The fairy princess!</i>
62125 63708 <i>How were we supposed to know?</i>
63791 64958 <i>She looked like a witch,</i>
65041 68375 <i>and everyone knows that a princess<br />doesn’t look like a witch.</i>
69083 73291 <i>Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson.<br />So, she put a curse on us.</i>
73958 78875 <i>And this was a nasty one that turned us<br />into ugly little green monsters</i>
78958 80166 <i>whenever people looked at us.</i>
80750 83625 <i>And the only way to break the curse<br />is to get a kiss</i>
83708 86541 <i>from the most beautiful woman<br />in the world.</i>
87250 90583 <i>Are you kidding me? With this face?</i>
137916 139541 Hello, your majesty.
139625 140791 Good morning, ma’am.
140875 141958 Good morning.
146541 150250 Magic tree, magic tree,
150333 156208 let this morning be the time<br />that you perform your duty…
162000 165833 of bringing me the shoes of youthful,
166500 170541 eternal beauty.
178000 178875 Yes.
178958 180250 -Wow.<br />-Wow.
180333 182125 Change me.
184291 185958 Finally.
190583 192958 Not again! How long must I wait?
193041 194708 -Oh, no.<br />-Clear these away!
194791 196208 Oh, head down.
196291 198166 Oh, pull yourself together.
201708 202750 Here you are.
204500 205708 Thanks!
228250 230500 Huh? That wasn’t here before.
231125 232416 What is she up to now?
252125 253166 Huh?
273708 274541 Huh?
278791 280500 You weren’t here before.
284791 285625 Whatever.
295958 297000 Yes!
300250 304666 <i>I can’t believe my beloved daughter,<br />Snow White, has turned eighteen.</i>
304750 306458 <i>I only wish her mother could see</i>
306541 310250 <i>the kind of smart and beautiful<br />young woman she’s become.</i>
311125 313958 <i>Strange thing happened during the party.</i>
314041 317666 <i>The castle guards brought in<br />a woman named Regina.</i>
318333 319833 <i>They said she was a witch.</i>
320416 323750 <i>But she was too beautiful to be a witch.</i>
323833 326125 <i>I have married Regina.</i>
326208 328208 <i>Everything feels so perfect!</i>
329125 332791 <i>Except for Regina’s<br />strange-looking mirror.</i>
332875 335166 <i>There’s something not quite right.</i>
336166 339791 <i>People around the castle<br />have been disappearing one by one.</i>
340500 343250 <i>Is it because of that peculiar mirror?</i>
343333 345708 <i>I saw it with my own eyes!</i>
345791 348166 <i>Regina, talking to a tree.</i>
348250 350375 <i>She must be a witch!</i>
351250 354791 <i>I should send Snow away, to a safer place.</i>
354875 356458 <i>My dear Snow,</i>
356541 360375 <i>by the time you read this,<br />my fate will be uncertain.</i>
360458 362333 <i>She’s coming for me now.</i>
362416 366708 <i>I only hope you can find<br />The Fearless Seven and ask them for help!</i>
368500 373083 <i>Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.</i>
374541 378666 Oh, Papa, where are you?
382083 383875 But they don’t look dangerous.
400916 401750 Regina?
401833 403750 No! My shoes!
403833 404875 Get her!
413958 415583 -Can I borrow this?<br />-Okay.
415666 416500 Thanks.
431083 431916 What?
433416 435583 No!
443291 445833 Short, chubby and green.
447250 448916 Green is like an ogre.
449000 452250 Blue or yellow could have made us<br />look cute and cuddly.
452333 454958 Quit your complaining, Merlin.
455041 458791 I’m figuring out how to take this curse<br />and kick it where the sun don’t shine.
458875 463500 Listen, we need to find<br />the most beautifulest princess to kiss us,
463583 465291 and we’ve just about run out of options!
466041 470333 How would a beautiful woman<br />even see you, Mr. Invisible?
473416 475500 What was that? Some kind of bird?
480333 483333 Magic Mirror full of wisdom,
483416 486541 who’s the fairest in the kingdom?
486625 489416 <i>The woman who wears the red shoes.</i>
491791 494708 And side-note, “wisdom” and “kingdom”<br />don’t really rhyme.
494791 498333 Cut the sass and tell me her name!
499375 501125 How should I know? I don’t get out much.
501208 503541 Well, you are the Magic Mirror.
503625 508458 “Magic” is just my first name.<br />It’s short for “Magichard,” like Richard.
508541 510666 What can you do then?
510750 513500 I just reflect what I see, the truth.
513583 515250 And the truth is,
515333 518625 that you should see yourself right now.
518708 520250 Right now.
521708 522666 Watch it.
523291 527250 Distribute wanted posters<br />to every town, village, valley, forest
527333 529916 and forge in the kingdom and find her!
531916 535625 I feel my power draining.<br />I don’t have much time.
535708 537875 The aging is accelerating.
537958 541041 And only three bumbling bits of kindling<br />for help.
541125 543083 Perhaps you should recruit another.
543166 545208 Someone who stands to gain<br />from your success.
545291 547125 How about this fellow?
548125 550166 Interesting.
551041 554541 Tell me more, Magichard.
555958 558250 Hey, hey, over here, over here!
558333 559666 <i>Si, si,</i> come, very quick!
559750 561625 Look <i>das</i>! Look, look, look!
562291 563541 What is it?
567833 569875 I know a lot about silhouettes.
569958 572458 And I think this shape is a witch.
572541 574125 Let’s not jump to conclusions.
574208 577791 Yes, it could be a witch, or--<br />Yeah, it’s a witch.
577875 579833 The witch who cursed us!
579916 581958 Let’s catch her<br />and make her break the spell!
600791 603208 -En garde!<br />-Wands where I can see ‘em, witch!
612583 614250 -Fräulein!<br />-No, no, no, stop!
614333 616583 I baked you some revenge!
619791 621500 Oh, beautiful.
621583 624791 I didn’t know anyone<br />could be so beautiful.
624875 626125 How did she end up with us?
633666 637541 Hello, dear lady.<br />Welcome to my home-slash-command post.
637625 640208 I have six roommates,<br />but my name’s on the lease.
640291 641666 I pay the rent.
641750 645791 Your home?<br />Oh, my gosh, I am, I am so sorry.
645875 648125 I was, I was starving and I wandered
648208 650333 -into this home--<br />-There’s no need to apologize.
650416 653166 We didn’t mean to interrupt<br />your stolen meal.
653250 656333 If you’re still hungry,<br />I can whip up something simple.
656416 658541 You see, I marinate the celery root<br />in a mustard aioli--
658625 659583 Who is that?
661208 663250 Uh, who?
668375 669583 Wow!
670166 673375 I look so different.
673458 677125 I mean my face, and my waist.<br />My waist? My waist.
677958 680541 Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
682791 683750 Well…
686458 690583 I must have gotten up so quickly.<br />My back is killing me!
691166 692875 You mean your head, right?
693833 695000 -Do you need help?<br />-No.
695958 697333 I’m fine.
699875 703583 Um, is that really what I look like?<br />In the mirror.
703666 704958 Do you see the same thing?
705041 706916 You’re beautiful, miss.
707000 708500 Like an angel.
708583 709583 Really?
710958 712208 Could it be?
712291 714000 Excuse me, but who are you?
714083 715625 Oh, I’m Snow--
715708 716750 Snot?
716833 718583 No, no, no, no, no, no.
719916 721875 My name is…
722625 723916 Red Shoes.
725333 728166 Yep, it’s me, Red Shoes!
728250 729166 Cool name.
729250 732833 By any chance,<br />would that be “Princess” Red Shoes?
732916 734541 Of course, she’s a princess!
734625 737291 How could she be so beautiful<br />if she weren’t?
737375 739333 Obviously. Right, miss?
739416 742375 Obviously. I mean, I am a princess.
743583 744791 Who are you guys?
744875 749666 I'm Merlin, part-time hero,<br />full-time romantic.
750500 753750 And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,<br />Pino, Noki, and Kio.
753833 757375 No way! Your names are the same as F7!
757458 760166 The Fearless Seven. I’m looking for them!
760250 762666 Let me guess, Merlin’s your favorite.
764125 766000 No, not really.
766083 768291 Nah, that Merlin’s not your type.
768375 771291 You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
771375 774708 Honestly, none of them are really my type.
777208 780958 Oh. Well, that’s fine<br />because we’re not them,
781041 783125 we’re actually<br />completely different people.
783208 786333 In no way, are we the same guys<br />put under a curse
786416 789166 and changed into different forms,<br />but only if someone looks at us.
789250 791000 It’s very complicated..
791083 792250 Glad we’re all clear.
793250 795708 So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
796333 799791 I need to find my father.<br />And I know that the F7 can help.
800625 804875 We know the F7 very well,<br />and their schedule is fully booked.
804958 807791 Leave it to me!<br />I’ll find your father within the month.
807875 809333 I can do it in one week.
809416 810500 Four days.
810583 811625 -<i>Tre giorni!</i><br />-Two!
811708 813583 One, and a half.
813666 815708 I already found your father<br />like two weeks ago.
815791 817000 Really?
817083 820041 I just need a few days<br />to get him across state lines.
820125 822083 I seriously need to find my dad.
822166 826458 Hold on. Nobody has seen the F7<br />in over a year, right?
826541 828500 You’re not going to find them now.
828583 829708 We’re your best bet.
829791 831291 Wow.
831375 834166 No one’s offered to help me<br />for such a long time.
835541 836666 You guys are awesome.
836750 840208 Really? You think we’re awesome?
840291 845583 Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and…
845666 848708 And not completely hideous to look at?
848791 851625 No. You guys are totally adorable.
851708 853625 I think I hit her too hard.
853708 856083 But she is a beautiful
857708 860041 She can help me break the curse.
865291 868500 Who is coming to my birthday party?
868583 870500 Has Ariel RSVP'd?
870583 873208 She says she can’t make it, sir.<br />She has to wax her legs.
873291 874458 But she’s a mermaid!
874541 875708 What about Sleeping Beauty?
875791 877000 Doctor’s appointment.
877083 877916 Is she sick?
878000 879125 Says she has insomnia.
879208 881375 If she’s not going to sleep,<br />she can come to our party.
881458 882625 What about Rapunzel?
882708 885666 And don’t tell me<br />she’s getting her hair done.
885750 888875 No, she’s writing something called a book.
888958 889916 Princess Cruise?
890000 891083 That’s a ship, sir.
891166 893083 -Princess Leia?<br />-She’s a general now.
893166 895791 I demand glorious guests!
895875 899250 I couldn’t be any more unpopular.
899333 901958 And I don’t understand why.
904583 907333 Greetings, Prince Average.
907416 909750 It’s pronounced “A-voo-raj.”
909833 911416 Sure it is.
911500 915125 If you’re here for<br />the We Love Our Peasants Gruel Giveaway,
915208 918250 that promotion has ended.<br />Grab your wrinkles and go.
918333 919291 Move along.
923541 927083 Do you think the people would respect you
927166 930125 if you celebrated your birthday
930208 934000 with a beautiful woman on your arm?
934583 939333 Finally, someone talking sense!<br />This horrible crone gets it.
939416 942625 Then may I suggest inviting
942708 944541 this young lady.
945791 948541 She’s beautiful! When can she get here?
948625 950458 Well that’s up to you.
950541 954208 You see, she’s stolen something from me.
954291 957750 You find her, bring her along with you
957833 960208 and you won’t look like such a loser,
960291 963416 and I get my shoes back.
963500 965625 Fear not, loyal hag.
965708 967916 I, Prince Average,
968000 971875 shall find this fugitive<br />and make her pay for her crimes.
971958 974000 By making her attend my birthday party!
975125 977583 There shall be balloons!
977666 981250 I just thought of that.<br />Let’s have a lot of balloons!
981333 983041 More like buffoons.
991875 993541 It looks just like Papa.
999500 1000708 Papa won’t recognize me.
1007250 1011416 Why won’t these shoes just, just come off?
1017333 1020666 Oh, yes. This is me.
1029166 1032708 Would you like to join me<br />in a moisturizing mask?
1032791 1035833 Oh, thanks. Oh, oof, but I am…
1037666 1038916 I'm so tired.
1039000 1040375 Are you sure?
1040458 1043000 It’s very important<br />to take care of your skin.
1043083 1044166 Positive.
1046416 1049625 But this is the finest French recipe<br />meant to hydrate skin.
1050208 1052416 It is made of French poopie!
1053500 1054416 Papa?
1055916 1059041 A spell that makes you fall in love…
1060333 1061541 Ah. There it is.
1062291 1064500 Merlin, have you seen my cookbook?
1064583 1066750 Have you checked in the kitchen?
1066833 1070333 Ah, silly me. The kitchen. Of course.
1072916 1074666 Now. Where was I?
1075666 1078083 Merlin. Have you seen my moisturizer?
1079333 1081041 -It’s nowhere to be found.<br />-No.
1081125 1083708 Whatever it is. I haven’t seen it.<br />Now, please, go away.
1083791 1086250 Someone’s got anger management issues.
1090208 1092708 Getting a kiss was never a problem<br />with this face.
1095541 1096666 Red Shoes?
1098666 1099750 Papa?
1100458 1102208 Papa, are you there?
1103250 1104166 Papa!
1127291 1131541 Boys, I’m telling you, sweet treats<br />are the way to a woman’s heart.
1133958 1137083 It works. I call it an auto-portrait!
1137166 1138750 I call it, the dupli-cata-tron!
1138833 1140208 I call it, selfie!
1140291 1142083 Red Shoes must love it!
1142166 1146125 Monsieur, Monsieur.<br />She doesn’t want sweets and selfies.
1146208 1148666 Women want diamonds.
1148750 1149958 Merlin?
1155958 1159916 <i>The Book of Spells<br />to Make You Fall in Love?</i>
1164041 1167791 Okay, big, terrifying wooden bunny.
1167875 1169291 You’re a nice bunny.
1170250 1172125 You’re a vegan bunny, right?
1175833 1178166 What was that? Lightning?
1178250 1180875 Actually, it’s called magic. I do it.
1180958 1183208 Really Then do some!
1203958 1206750 Keep running!<br />And whatever you do, don’t look back!
1206833 1208041 But I can’t leave without you.
1208125 1210833 You’re looking back! Don’t do that!
1210916 1211750 But…
1212375 1217125 Hate to zap you, long ears.<br />But I need to impress a beautiful woman.
1217208 1219541 Big, scary bunny! Over here!
1219625 1221333 Red, stop putting yourself in--
1223625 1225416 Danger.
1245250 1246875 Arthur, I got you!
1246958 1253000 It’s no use, Red Shoes.<br />I’m slipping away. Not much time.
1253083 1256333 Just need to use that core of mine.
1256416 1258958 I see that light at the end of the funnel.
1259041 1264500 Time for me to kick butt in heaven.<br />I had a good run. Hashtag blessed.
1264583 1268875 Oh, I used to be able to bench 250.
1268958 1272000 Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
1272083 1275166 Red Shoes! Oh, thank goodness you’re safe.
1275250 1278083 Do you need CPR? I’m basically an expert.
1278166 1280333 And don't worry,<br />I brushed my teeth. Twice.
1280416 1282625 No, no, no, no, I’m fine,<br />but Arthur, he’s stuck.
1282708 1284375 He tried to save me,<br />and then he got stuck…
1284458 1285333 Would you get up.
1286041 1287791 What? He’s not hurt?
1287875 1288958 Only his pride.
1289041 1290250 Seriously, Arthur.
1290333 1292541 You need to find a better way<br />to hit on girls.
1302250 1304958 Stand back.<br />I may have to risk my life again.
1314375 1316291 Someone call for three inventors?
1316375 1317916 For three geniuses?
1318500 1319708 That sounds like us!
1320958 1322666 Everyone came running to help.
1322750 1324625 Great, just great.
1324708 1326375 Everyone except Merlin that is.
1326458 1328625 Super. There he is now.
1328708 1330000 Where have you been?
1330083 1332916 Something awful could have happened<br />to Red if I hadn’t shown up.
1333000 1334000 You?
1334750 1339625 Don’t even go there, I saved her first.
1340541 1342625 -Right?<br />-I was worried about you.
1342708 1346208 I was worried about me too.<br />But mostly you.
1346291 1348750 No one needs to worry. Arthur’s here.
1348833 1351541 -Please, my lady.<br />-Um, okay.
1360791 1362750 You shouldn’t go<br />into the forest by yourself.
1362833 1368416 It’s a nightmarish landscape fit only<br />for bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
1368500 1369583 And squirrels.
1369666 1371208 I thought I saw my father.
1372083 1374958 Turned out just to be that big bunny.
1375041 1379041 Well, if you ever make such a dangerous<br />and weird mistake again,
1379125 1381125 just know that I can protect you.
1381750 1383250 That’s very kind.
1383333 1388125 And if you really want<br />to express your gratitude, you can…
1389583 1392166 Oh, I am so sorry!
1392250 1397166 That was much slappier<br />than I intended it to be.
1397250 1400125 Oh, it happens. No problem.
1400916 1402958 Maybe an apology kiss then?
1405916 1407583 <i>Bravo, mon ami!</i>
1407666 1408958 Nice try.
1409708 1411250 Red Shoes!
1416208 1417583 Gentlemen, to break this curse,
1417666 1419625 we’re going to have to work<br />as a tightly-knit team.
1419708 1421583 Which means you do everything I say.
1421666 1423000 -<i>Scusi?</i><br />-What? No.
1423083 1423916 You got to be kidding
1424000 1426333 Hans and Jack will search<br />around the Dismal Lake.
1426416 1429083 Triplets, you search the Caves of Despair.
1429166 1432333 Red Shoes and I<br />will go to Golden Goose Avenue.
1432416 1434166 Golden Goose Avenue.
1434250 1437250 Which happens to be<br />your go-to place for dates.
1437333 1442208 We are going to focus on the mission.<br />And then see where the evening takes us.
1442291 1446416 The only thing you’re going to shop for<br />on Golden Goose Avenue is rejection.
1446500 1448083 And you can’t even afford that.
1448166 1450833 I like my odds. You saw what she did.
1450916 1455166 An expression of affection.<br />Every woman shows it differently.
1455250 1456833 You took your shot, you got slapped.
1456916 1460333 May I remind you,<br />that this is the closest thing to a kiss
1460416 1461916 anyone’s had since the curse.
1463000 1466666 Let’s work together<br />to guide Red Shoes’ feelings towards me,
1466750 1468416 so we can break the curse.
1468500 1469708 What about the rest of us?
1469791 1474833 After I resume my princely form,<br />the word about F7 will be out.
1474916 1478708 Ladies will be begging to kiss<br />your green mugs.
1478791 1480625 -Really?<br />-Sounds reasonable.
1480708 1482250 I’ll bring the gelato!
1482333 1484833 Getting one kiss<br />sure is easier than getting seven.
1484916 1487916 This is not a plan!<br />He’s just out for himself.
1488000 1489583 A half-baked plan is better than none.
1489666 1493291 Don’t worry, Merlin.<br />I have a big assignment for you.
1494166 1495375 Big assignment?
1495958 1498375 Here you go. I drew these up last night.
1498458 1504250 {\an8}I can’t tell if this drawing<br />is terrible or really avant-garde.
1504333 1508166 Oh, my neighbor’s a great art teacher,<br />Pablo Picass-ogre.
1508250 1512333 One thing’s for sure,<br />Daddy’s on the big side
1512416 1514125 …of big.
1515166 1516833 You must take after your mother.
1516916 1518208 No, I look a lot like Pa--
1518291 1521500 Oh, yeah, my mother. Gosh, we…
1522500 1525250 Exactly. Twins.
1526125 1527875 Alright, you know the plan.
1527958 1529875 Let’s move! Deploy!
1529958 1532041 Thunder Dwarfs are go!
1534333 1536166 And where do you think you’re going?
1536250 1537916 Your post is right there.
1538000 1539458 You watch the savage monster.
1539541 1540541 I call him vicious.
1540625 1542166 I call him “Woodbottom.”
1542250 1544750 Don’t worry, Merlin,<br />we’ll make sure you get kissed, too.
1544833 1546125 Eventually.
1547833 1549000 We will split up here.
1549083 1550583 Alright. See you later.
1551416 1554708 I know exactly where we should look<br />to find your father!
1554791 1556291 Really? Where?
1564541 1565375 Daddy!
1565458 1566666 Wow!
1567708 1569000 Is this what I think it is?
1569083 1575250 I present Excalibur, a legendary sword<br />trapped in this rock for centuries,
1575333 1578541 waiting for a man of great strength<br />to release it.
1578625 1582000 It says,<br />“Do not attempt to remove by force.”
1582083 1584833 Oh, right. I guess, uh…
1584916 1591250 The truth is, I realized you are the woman<br />of my destiny the first time I saw you.
1591333 1594083 I thought if I could show you my strength,
1594166 1596458 I would be worthy of your affections.
1602041 1603916 Oops! I’ll put it back.
1604000 1605708 No! No, no, no. Can I hold it?
1616125 1619375 Oh, Arthur, it’s just beginners luck.
1619458 1621875 You want me to,<br />maybe pull it out for you again?
1621958 1624208 No. I’m not humiliated at all.
1625041 1626125 {\an8}Let’s go.
1635666 1639125 Don’t look at me like that.<br />I’m the real prisoner here.
1639833 1641833 What? You’re hungry?
1643041 1645000 And fetch!
1652833 1654583 Hop along, big guy.
1654666 1657375 There’s no way Arthur<br />is breaking this curse alone.
1674291 1675291 Excuse me!
1677208 1678958 Arthur, where are you going?
1681541 1683000 Oh. Okay.
1683875 1684916 See you later.
1686333 1687333 Hi.
1687416 1689833 Oh, look at what you made me do!
1689916 1690791 You…
1691666 1692666 I’m sorry.
1692750 1696041 …made me make it perfect. Thank you.
1698458 1700500 I’m so sorry.
1700583 1703666 No. Don’t be. I’m sorry.
1703750 1705208 Are you all right?
1705291 1708000 And don’t worry about this.
1711166 1713250 -What?<br />-Ta-da!
1716125 1718333 {\an8}Excuse me, have you seen this man?
1780791 1783708 Arthur. I was thinking.
1783791 1786291 What if I just like pull out<br />the Excalibur for you?
1786375 1787375 Our secret.
1788666 1791625 -Really? We have a secret now?<br />-Yeah.
1791708 1794125 I like a girl<br />who can keep things classified.
1794208 1796541 Let’s find your pops, Red!
1796625 1797750 Bye, guys
1801666 1802916 What?
1804083 1807166 Hey, you. No.
1808625 1809708 Hey!
1810375 1811500 Stop!
1817291 1818541 Come on.
1845833 1847750 Oh, you guys don’t have to help.
1847833 1849958 That’s not her. Come on.
1850041 1850916 Sorry, miss.
1855083 1857583 Red Shoes! Where has she gone.
1857666 1859291 Where’s Red Shoes?
1859375 1860833 That’s what I’d like to know!
1861583 1862875 Wait a minute,
1862958 1864500 who said you could leave your post?
1864583 1866625 I’m just walking the bunny.
1869125 1871541 Red Shoes, where are you?
1871625 1873750 Hey, you’ve seen this girl?
1879791 1880833 Look what I found.
1880916 1884166 Oh, those are mine.<br />Um, can I actually have my shoes back?
1886625 1889166 No way! You're not serious, are you?
1889250 1893083 I’m really not in the mood.<br />Could you just please give ’em back to me?
1893166 1895375 Ha! They won't even fit on you!
1895458 1897875 They’re gonna fit me<br />better than they fit you. Hey!
1899416 1900625 Red Shoes!
1900708 1902666 Guys, guys, I’m here!
1906166 1907708 Red Shoes!
1907791 1909291 Red Shoes, where are you?
1910666 1913041 Even the hideous dwarfs won’t help you.
1915458 1921291 Those dwarfs are not hideous,<br />and I don’t need anyone to help me.
1923083 1926041 Freeze! Put the shoes down,<br />get on your knees,
1926125 1927833 and put your hands behind your head.
1927916 1929416 On second thought, they’re yours.
1929500 1932625 There’s no need to push me into a corner.
1932708 1934208 This is super scary.
1945416 1947125 Your red shoes, m'lady.
1947958 1948791 Thank you.
1949375 1951791 Excuse me miss, have we met?
1951875 1955916 Um, well, that's kind of<br />a complicated question.
1956000 1957583 Red Shoes!
1957666 1960083 Gotta go. Be safe.
1980458 1981291 Guys!
1984250 1985833 Where has she gone?
1986666 1987750 Red Shoes!
1988458 1989625 Stop!
1992458 1993291 -Hold on!<br />-Whoa!
1996875 1997833 Wait a minute.
1999250 2000916 Got you now, don’t we?
2002125 2003166 I don’t get it.
2006625 2009291 Now we know how fast bunny can hop<br />in a pinch.
2009375 2011208 Thank you for helping me, Merlin.
2011291 2013125 Pleasure my lady.
2013208 2015083 But I also did it for us.
2016166 2018416 By the way, what is this?
2020000 2023250 Gosh, it sounds silly, but it’s my shoes.
2024791 2027083 -They’re magical.<br />-I know they’re fabulous.
2027166 2028833 But why they are after you?
2028916 2031250 No my shoes, they're…
2031333 2033333 they're actually made of magic.
2033416 2035083 Red Shoes!
2035166 2037666 -Are you a criminal?<br />-No, of course not.
2038625 2041791 I know girl this pretty<br />couldn’t possibly be a criminal
2041875 2043375 Look we should head out now.
2043458 2045458 There could be more guards around<br />any minute.
2045541 2048708 Don’t worry about them.<br />I’ve got these bad boys.
2048791 2051625 This is going to make so much harder<br />to find my dad.
2055666 2056875 I have an idea!
2092333 2093916 Ta-da!
2094000 2095416 Oh, wow!
2101000 2102500 What do you think?
2102583 2105041 That is amazing.
2106708 2107708 Thank you.
2124666 2127625 You had a thing on your cheek
2127708 2128791 Alright, let’s go.
2148583 2149708 We've been walking for hours.
2149791 2151916 And we'll keep walking till we find her.
2158916 2160375 Now we’ve got her.
2161958 2163416 Are they gone?
2163500 2164416 Who cares.
2164500 2166166 Come on, let’s go see.
2167125 2168125 Look at that!
2168625 2170083 -Wow!<br />-Wow!
2170166 2171208 Awesome!
2171291 2172458 Who’s that?
2172541 2173750 It’s the girl’s father.
2173833 2175291 But where is the girl?
2175375 2178375 It said to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2178458 2180041 But why Risky Rock?
2180125 2181458 We should ask the girl.
2181541 2183958 Perfect! Where is the girl?
2184041 2187208 It said to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2187875 2190375 But why Risky Rock?
2190458 2191416 We should ask the girl.
2191500 2193666 Um… where is the girl?
2193750 2196291 It said to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2196375 2198666 But why Risky Rock?
2198750 2200250 We should ask the girl.
2221375 2222416 What was that for?
2222500 2225583 You, sir, are sabotaging my relationship<br />with Red Shoes.
2225666 2228000 What “relationship” are you talking about?
2228083 2231708 Red Shoes and I share a secret.<br />I would tell you what it is.
2231791 2233375 But it’s a secret.
2233458 2237000 While you’re busy keeping secrets,<br />I’m going to break my curse.
2237083 2239250 You’re nothing<br />without your spells, magic boy.
2239333 2241625 And you’re nothing without Excalibur.
2242416 2246458 You’re not waiting for someone<br />to pull it out for you, are you?
2246541 2247625 How did you know?
2247708 2248875 Is it true?
2263541 2265416 Hans, you shouldn’t have!
2265500 2268291 Something sweet for someone sweeter.
2270416 2272125 This is spectacular!
2272208 2273208 Oh, it’s nothing.
2273291 2277125 Just let me know what you want,<br />anytime, for the rest of your life.
2277208 2278083 Do you like fondue?
2278166 2283333 Behold, carved by the finest jewelers<br />out of all the jewelers I know.
2283416 2284625 Which is a lot.
2286000 2288666 -It’s pretty.<br />-And it’s yours, Miss Shoes.
2288750 2291291 Yours, in exchange for nothing.
2291375 2292250 Maybe a kiss.
2292333 2295500 That’s really sweet, Jack,<br />but I can’t accept it.
2295583 2298333 I don’t want your jewels,<br />only your good intentions.
2298416 2301833 My intentions are more than good.<br />They’re super <i>bon.</i>
2301916 2303041 <i>Testing, one, two.</i>
2303125 2305833 <i>Testing. No I’m pushing that, you dolt.</i>
2305916 2308208 Attention, hideous dwarfs!
2308291 2311250 Is it dwarfs, with a “F,”<br />or dwarfs, with a “V?”
2311333 2313041 I want to use whatever’s more offensive.
2313125 2314750 Oh, it’s that loser, Prince Average.
2314833 2316958 Heard that! It’s “A-voo-raj.”
2317041 2318208 Oh, please.
2318291 2322166 Inside your amateurish attempt<br />at a façade of a sham of a travesty
2322250 2326750 of a veneer of a castle<br />is a gorgeous wanted criminal.
2326833 2330083 I hereby command that all of you<br />exit the premises
2330166 2331375 and surrender post haste!
2331458 2335541 Fail to comply,<br />and you will never see these two again.
2335625 2337541 You have until three…
2337625 2338708 One…
2340625 2341791 Two…
2341875 2343083 I lied! Charge!
2363666 2365166 Am I the person you want?
2365250 2367125 Yes. Yes, you are.
2367208 2369625 Though I don’t know if you’re a person<br />or a vision of beauty,
2369708 2373041 some kind of angelic thing with wings.
2373125 2375041 Angelic wing thing.
2375125 2378625 I will come with you.<br />But only after you release my friends.
2378708 2379791 Do it. Do it!
2381958 2383416 Now. Here’s the good news.
2383500 2388125 It’s my birthday and you are going to be<br />the belle of the ball.
2388208 2392166 The invitation sounds great, really. But…
2392250 2394291 It wasn’t an invitation, more of an order.
2394375 2395625 Prepare the lady’s carriage.
2395708 2397958 She said she doesn’t wanna go, Average.
2398041 2402500 "A-voo-raj." Don’t troll me, troll.
2403125 2404166 So rude!
2404250 2407500 I couldn’t agree more.<br />Subjects these days. Now, shall we?
2416125 2417250 Get her!
2417333 2419375 You hold off the guards,<br />and I’ll get her out of here.
2419458 2422208 No, I’m faster!<br />You stay here and buy us time.
2430500 2433791 Here’s a thought. Stop fighting and fight!
2435291 2436250 What’s the plan?
2437333 2438791 Let’s rescue Red Shoes.
2438875 2440833 Like the old days, guys.
2475708 2476958 Arthur!
2482750 2484833 Can we get this over with,<br />they’re just dwarfs.
2497291 2499750 Hey. Did you guys hear something?
2508708 2509750 Come on!
2521375 2522250 Uh-oh.
2537375 2539166 Hi, guards, are we taking a break?
2539250 2540750 Well, FYI,
2540833 2543291 they're getting away!
2549875 2551208 No.
2556916 2559833 Who’s throwing vegetables? Huh?
2563666 2566750 Yeah! You just got Merlin’d!
2574750 2575583 Run!
2577125 2578125 Jack!
2588958 2589791 Duck!
2594958 2596708 I’m so sorry, are you alright?
2596791 2598833 No, I’m not.
2604833 2607833 Gentlemen, he surrenders.
2607916 2608791 What?
2639041 2640208 Engines, full power!
2640291 2641291 Shields up!
2642625 2644000 Turn on the mini-fridge!
2662875 2664375 Superhero landing!
2664458 2665291 Hooray for us!
2665375 2667875 We did it! It was mostly me.
2667958 2669125 -Yeah!<br />-Yeah!
2669208 2670041 What?
2673875 2675083 You got to be kidding.
2675166 2677791 Finally, the big guns. Thank you!
2677875 2678750 Fire!
2686916 2687916 Fire.
2694125 2695625 Oh, close.
2696208 2697833 The cannonball, not you.
2698458 2701083 Okay, time out, time out!<br />Everyone, time out.
2701166 2702416 You almost blew her up.
2702500 2704541 And she can’t come to my party<br />if you blow her up.
2704625 2705916 Sorry sir…
2706000 2707250 All right, time back in.
2708625 2709666 Surrender, monsters.
2709750 2710916 No, wait.
2743416 2744791 Huh, that’s pretty cool.
2752500 2754291 Everyone inside! And hurry!
2755791 2756708 Look out!
2768583 2770916 You messed with the wrong prince.
2771000 2773833 There’s nothing average about Average.
2773916 2777208 I shall return!
2777291 2778291 On Tuesday.
2778375 2780791 No, wait, let me check my calendar…
2780875 2781708 Thursday.
2781791 2784708 I shall return Thursday!
2786166 2787375 We’ll be ready.
2787458 2788291 And waiting.
2788375 2789458 Arrivederci!
2789541 2791125 -Ciao for now!<br />-Bye, bye!
2791208 2792958 You just got dwarfed!
2793041 2795083 Is that better?<br />I think Merlin’d is better.
2811416 2814458 You should have seen<br />the look on his big, ugly face
2814541 2816208 when Bunny came running at him.
2817041 2819208 That’s how you see everything, isn’t it?
2819291 2820208 With my eyes?
2820291 2823458 You always talk about<br />what someone looks like.
2823541 2824625 I do?
2824708 2826000 I wouldn’t say that.
2826083 2828458 But I can’t wait<br />for you to see the real me.
2828541 2830833 What kind of Merlin is the real you?
2830916 2832250 You might not believe it,
2832333 2836083 but the real me is famous,<br />handsome and even popular.
2836166 2839375 Not short, stumpy and green.
2839458 2842000 Yeah, you’re short, stumpy and green.
2842083 2845583 But you’re also a wonderful<br />and charming person.
2845666 2847083 I’m not explaining it right.
2847166 2850833 If you saw the real me,<br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
2851625 2853541 I think I can see the real you.
2854166 2857083 And I like you, just as you are.
2859458 2860625 That’s hilarious.
2860708 2864666 Here, close your eyes,<br />and imagine the real me.
2864750 2867500 I guarantee you it’ll be different.
2869500 2872958 I do feel something different.
2873041 2874291 Really?
2874375 2879000 But eyes opened or closed,<br />to me you’re still Merlin.
2880375 2881250 Now tell me,
2882541 2884416 who am I to you?
2885458 2887083 You’re a gift.
2887166 2891916 A gift that’ll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
2892000 2893833 Just like you’re amazing.
2902375 2905458 Actually, I want to show you<br />something, too.
2910250 2911541 Do you need a hand?
2911625 2913208 Hold on! Nope. Stand back.
2913791 2915416 I got this.
2915500 2917083 One, two…
2917166 2919125 Okay, yeah. I need help.
2937125 2938583 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2938666 2940458 Nope. Thank you though.
2946541 2949583 You know the weird thing is,<br />they’re super comfortable.
2951875 2955291 No, I’m just saying, where were you<br />when the façade was falling?
2955375 2957250 I mean that was terrifying.
2959375 2960875 What are you doing here?
2962500 2964250 I’ve come for my shoes.
2964333 2966791 Well, I had them. I mean, I saw them.
2966875 2968916 But those, those dwarfs.
2969000 2970333 It’s dwarfs. With a “v.”
2970416 2972083 So you failed?
2972166 2973625 I did not fail.
2973708 2976208 I took a time-out.
2976291 2978375 Yeah, this is a calculated time-out,
2978458 2980541 I’m going to return on Thursday,<br />we all penciled it in.
2980625 2982000 Silence!
2982083 2983458 Have a bite.
2983541 2985250 For strength.
2986041 2986916 Apples.
2987708 2990041 The most suspicious of fruits.
2990125 2993125 I don’t have much time, Prince.
2993208 2997375 You could still have<br />the best birthday ever.
2997458 3001125 But remember what’s bad for me,
3001208 3005333 will be very bad for you.
3011625 3012458 She is gone.
3013708 3016125 Ah, what’s the worst that could happen?
3019833 3020958 It's kinda sweet--
3037125 3038125 Don’t move.
3038208 3039041 Okay.
3039125 3041166 Pino, Noki, Kio, show us what you got!
3041250 3042791 Okeydokey. Here we go!
3042875 3044125 Our pleasure!
3051375 3053875 Keep going, yeah, yeah,<br />a little, a little to the left.
3053958 3055041 Whoa, whoa, right there.
3070458 3071875 Wow.
3071958 3073541 Now that looks like a real home.
3073625 3075458 Yeah. I could get used to that.
3075541 3076750 Uh-uh. I cannot.
3080666 3083625 It’s a perfect copy of my drawing!<br />That’s incredible!
3084958 3086083 Let me try.
3086166 3089500 Wow, this will definitely make it easier<br />to find your dad.
3089583 3092083 Unfortunately, this thing ain’t flying.
3092166 3094000 -It’s grounded.<br />-Why does it need to fly?
3094083 3096458 The posters are no good<br />if we can’t distribute them fast.
3096541 3101083 Guys, thank you so much<br />for everything you’re doing for me.
3101166 3102375 Oh, my pleasure.
3102458 3103708 Oh, it's nice.
3124333 3125500 Hi.
3147208 3148041 Watch out.
3148958 3149791 Whoa.
3160958 3161791 Wow.
3172750 3174041 Opening doors!
3190125 3193000 You know, Merlin?<br />I feel so lucky that I’ve meet you.
3194000 3195750 I feel the same way!
3196416 3199750 I feel like anything is possible!
3215833 3217666 Merlin, watch out!
3228916 3230125 Merlin.
3232208 3233333 Merlin.
3234625 3235666 Merlin.
3235750 3237333 Everything okay?
3238000 3239291 Of course, sure!
3239916 3241166 Nothing to be embarrassed about.
3241250 3245375 So why are we even talking about that<br />when we should be going…
3245458 3246458 this direction.
3246541 3247541 Hey, wait!
3251333 3254166 So, about these magic shoes.
3254250 3255583 Are those still bothering you?
3255666 3257875 What kind of magic do those shoes have?
3257958 3258791 Well…
3259958 3261125 How do I put this?
3261208 3265250 Merlin, I used to be strong.<br />Really strong.
3265333 3267541 And, I was always proud of that.
3267625 3272666 But the shoes’ magic,<br />um, it made me a little dainty.
3272750 3273791 Sorry to hear.
3273875 3278291 The shoes made me lose<br />a little bit of weight.
3278375 3279583 Could be worse.
3279666 3280750 Okay.
3282000 3283208 A lot of weight.
3283291 3284166 Ah.
3284250 3287375 {\an8}Well, I know what it’s like<br />to look different on the outside
3287458 3288791 {\an8}from what you feel on the inside.
3293458 3297291 Merlin, I'd like to do give you<br />a token of my appreciation.
3298916 3300833 Oh, here. Hand me one of your spells.
3300916 3302791 -Why?<br />-Oh, come on.
3302875 3304375 I’m not going to zap you.
3305416 3306375 Give me a sec.
3318958 3322583 There. Consider it your good luck charm.
3326166 3327250 Thank you.
3333708 3340083 Merlin, do you think we’d be happier<br />if we were our old selves again?
3340166 3343125 Yup. Yup, yup, definitely we would.
3343208 3344458 I don’t know.
3345583 3346916 I like how we are.
3347916 3351208 Right here, just, right now.
3351916 3355541 Even if I’m an ugly green monster?
3357208 3360791 I don’t care about your height<br />or what color you are.
3361791 3365250 I mean, that’s the way<br />you feel about me, right?
3365333 3368416 Yes, of course! I mean, duh.
3370166 3374083 I think we’re both just trapped<br />under the same spell.
3390208 3392958 Wait. Keep your eyes closed.
3394250 3396291 Don’t open them until I say.
3396375 3401541 When you open your eyes, there will be<br />a handsome man in front of you.
3401625 3405208 Someone worthy of you.<br />Someone you’d be proud to be seen with.
3406291 3407541 I think you’re right.
3407625 3410375 Ready, and…
3410458 3413291 Oh, it’s such a good day to break a curse.
3416041 3417458 Now!
3417541 3418791 Ta-da!
3418875 3420708 You just got Merlin’d!
3422208 3423708 What do you think?
3423791 3427250 Mission impossibly handsome, right?
3428791 3432291 Oh, it’s okay.<br />I know this is a lot to take in.
3432375 3434958 But you can let your happiness flag fly.
3435041 3439125 This. This. Is the real me.
3439916 3441000 It’s stupid.
3441083 3442125 What?
3443125 3447208 Wait a minute.<br />My hands are still green sausages.
3448416 3450750 No. I look the same.
3450833 3453333 Yes. Impossibly handsome.
3453416 3455583 This doesn’t make sense.
3455666 3457375 You’re the most beautiful woman<br />in the world!
3457458 3458916 Why do I look the same?
3459000 3460708 What are you talking about, Merlin?
3460791 3462541 Do I need a longer kiss?
3462625 3463750 Two kisses?
3464708 3466375 Let’s try again.
3466458 3469291 Um, you’re not making any sense.
3478541 3479375 Hurry!
3481416 3482583 What is that?
3482666 3485208 This kingdom has<br />a serious monster problem!
3501125 3503958 -You all right?<br />-No, I’m not.
3512208 3513958 -Thank you.<br />-Pleasure, my lady.
3514916 3516291 Whoa!
3516375 3517625 Watch out!
3535083 3536416 -Yes!<br />-What?
3543125 3544291 What do they want?
3544375 3546333 -Besides smashing us?<br />-I don’t know!
3555583 3557250 The old me would have nailed that.
3565583 3567500 You just got Merlin’d!
3578000 3579041 Hurry!
3594375 3595958 Red, close your eyes.
3596041 3597875 This is no time for kissing, Merlin!
3597958 3599875 Just trust me. Close your eyes.
3601083 3603208 Please! Close them!
3607041 3608958 -Huh?<br />-That was too close.
3609708 3611125 Don’t look at me.
3611208 3613416 You see that tree<br />on the other side of the bridge?
3613500 3614916 -Yeah.<br />-On my signal,
3615000 3617000 run towards it as fast as you can.
3617083 3618500 No, I can’t leave you here!
3618583 3621916 You have to. And don’t look back, okay?
3622000 3624291 Look right at that tree<br />until I say it’s safe.
3624375 3626000 Promise you won’t look.
3626083 3628583 Um, okay. I promise.
3629166 3630333 Now!
3661708 3663833 What’s that? You just got Merlin’d?
3663916 3664750 Yes, you did.
3694083 3695958 Hey, block-head!
3696750 3698458 Hey block-head bear!
3698541 3702125 You're even more of a block-head<br />than Prince Average!
3704125 3706666 A-voo-raj!
3706750 3708250 Prince Average?
3724458 3725833 You just got Merlin’d.
3729583 3731875 -Take a look, Red Shoes.<br />-Merlin!
3731958 3734375 I have triumphantly saved the day.
3735583 3736875 Merlin! No!
3738833 3740666 No! Merlin!
3744916 3746125 Merlin!
3811458 3812375 Snow White?
3822291 3823833 Snow White?
3823916 3827000 The thief was Snow White this whole time?
3827083 3830708 Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
3832333 3834750 You’re going after her yourself?
3834833 3836541 What? Were you going to go?
3837250 3839583 I get it. I don’t have legs.
3842500 3845541 So. Here I am.
3846625 3847833 Well, the real me.
3849291 3850916 I bet you’re disappointed, huh?
3851000 3854125 You’re the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.
3854208 3855708 -Red Shoes!<br />-That’s not my name.
3856791 3857875 It’s Snow White.
3857958 3860708 Princess Snow White? So your father is--
3860791 3863208 King White, yeah.
3863291 3866666 By the time I figured out his new wife,<br />Regina, was a witch,
3868083 3869375 he’d already disappeared.
3870416 3874416 And the monsters who attacked us<br />were sent by my stepmother
3874500 3876958 to get these shoes.
3878291 3881333 I guess being beautiful<br />is really worth that much to her.
3881416 3884583 Have you thought about<br />just giving them back?
3885458 3886708 And give up their magic?
3888333 3891916 If I’d given up their magic you wouldn’t<br />have helped me find my father, would you?
3893083 3894166 Would you?
3898083 3900333 I thought we were both under<br />the same spell,
3901916 3905250 but I see now that, I was wrong.
3905333 3908791 Listen, I can’t get into all the details,
3908875 3911125 but I’m under a curse too.
3911208 3913000 You still don’t get it, Merlin.
3914375 3916541 I’m not talking about our curses,
3917708 3920125 Merlin, I’m talking about<br />the kind of spell…
3921833 3923083 you never want to break.
3972500 3974875 He likes you more than he likes me.
4006833 4009041 What would have happened<br />if she had taken off her shoes
4009125 4010083 that day in the barn?
4010166 4011250 You think that’s important?
4014208 4018875 I just wonder what I would have done<br />if I had seen the real Snow White.
4018958 4022875 Seriously?<br />It’s still all about appearance for you.
4022958 4025833 No! Not exactly.
4026708 4030125 But I can’t live looking like you<br />for the rest of my life!
4030208 4032041 Kind of proving my point, other me.
4032125 4034625 Alright, let’s try this,
4034708 4037333 who do you like more,<br />Snow White or Red Shoes?
4037416 4039333 Easy! It’s Red Shoes.
4039416 4042166 Now, which of us<br />do you think Red Shoes likes more?
4042250 4044000 Easy! It’s me.
4045791 4048416 Wait, no.
4049041 4051583 It’s you.
4087791 4089666 You’re a gift.
4089750 4093541 A gift that’ll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
4114333 4116916 Well, I know what it’s like<br />to look different on the outside
4117000 4118375 from what you feel on the inside.
4138208 4139291 Look at that!
4144041 4145083 The shoes.
4146083 4146916 You’re wearing them.
4147000 4148791 I thought you left.
4148875 4150375 You should take them off again.
4155750 4156583 I can’t.
4157791 4160625 You just had to make things complicated.
4161500 4163125 Maybe this will help.
4163208 4165625 Eat the apple,<br />and they’ll slide right off.
4165708 4166708 Where did you get that?
4166791 4170166 I want to help you, Snow White. Please.
4177250 4178666 Red Shoes!
4178750 4179583 Merlin?
4180541 4181708 Merlin?
4184666 4186958 What terrible timing you have.
4190041 4191916 We’re going to have to do this<br />the hard way.
4192583 4193500 Regina?
4197125 4200291 Such a tender family reunion.
4200375 4202583 So sad we can’t stay.
4203291 4204375 Red Shoes!
4206958 4208833 Come on. Let’s go, long ears!
4208916 4210583 Hey! Wait for us!
4210666 4212458 How about you go back and get the others.
4212541 4214666 And make lots of copies of this.
4215166 4216166 Let’s go!
4218541 4220458 -We can do this!<br />-Yeah!
4223333 4225958 Your power, my lady, it has drained you.
4226041 4227125 You think?
4227208 4230000 I don’t need you tell me how I look.
4230083 4232541 I’m a mirror. It’s what I do.
4232625 4235083 M-I-R-O-R. I can’t spell.
4235166 4236208 Enough!
4237458 4238458 Bind her.
4239375 4241708 It’s snack time.
4245541 4248000 How can you sleep-eat at a time like this?
4249333 4251916 I’m not supposed to talk<br />when I have this on,
4252000 4255333 but I got to ask,<br />do you think they’ve kissed yet?
4255416 4256541 I hope so.
4256625 4259541 Because it’ll feel better to punch Merlin<br />when he’s pretty.
4260791 4263916 We’ve been waiting forever!<br />Where have you bee--
4264000 4265125 Did you break the curse, yet?
4265208 4266583 Ah, Merlin, are you hungry?
4266666 4267666 Those are bears.
4267750 4270166 Uh, hi.
4270250 4271666 This is from Merlin.
4290250 4292375 Wow. This is so cool.
4296208 4297708 Okay, sword.
4297791 4302750 If you think you’ve humiliated,<br />embarrassed and otherwise frustrated me…
4302833 4303833 You’re right.
4304750 4308041 But that ends now!
4318958 4320458 Please end this.
4331625 4335791 Hey! Wait! you are running the wrong way!
4335875 4337291 The castle is over there!
4352500 4354791 Uh, sit?
4366458 4370125 Eat this, darling,<br />and you’ll get your freedom.
4370208 4371666 Where’s my father?
4372666 4376791 Royal, loyal little girl,<br />pining for her papa.
4376875 4378166 This is getting a little boring.
4378250 4381500 So I need you to take a bite,<br />and I’ll tell you.
4381583 4382583 I won’t let you win.
4383250 4386333 You’ve torn apart my family,<br />and you will not get away with it, Regina.
4387791 4390666 Oh, I'm so scared, Snow.
4390750 4394416 Very well. A different approach, then.
4402291 4403958 -Merlin!<br />-No!
4404041 4406583 Eat the apple or watch him die.
4406666 4409625 -That’s your choice.<br />-Red Shoes! Don’t do it!
4409708 4411041 No!
4411833 4413625 No, Red Shoes!
4413708 4416000 Promise to me you’ll let him go.
4416083 4417833 Oh, absolutely.
4417916 4419583 When the third bell chimes,
4419666 4422541 everything will be<br />just like it used to be.
4422625 4424500 Don’t do it. No, no.
4427375 4429125 Save my papa for me.
4431458 4432833 No!
4433583 4435083 Red Shoes!
4437583 4439083 No!
4439166 4441166 Red Shoes!
4455916 4460500 The legendary handsome Merlin,<br />fearless rescuer of princesses…
4460583 4462000 …sitting in a tree.
4462083 4465333 Not getting K-I-S-I-N-G’d!
4466791 4468416 Burn! I can’t spell.
4470708 4474208 You don’t have to do this.<br />Just take the shoes and let us go!
4475125 4477625 I wish. They’re made of pure magic apple.
4477708 4480833 The fruit of temptation and want.<br />They feed on your desires.
4480916 4485208 And once they give you what you desire,<br />the bond is permanent.
4485291 4487541 That’s not true.<br />She took them off in the river.
4487625 4489583 That doesn’t make any sense.
4489666 4494166 How could she possibly want to save you<br />more than she wanted to be beautiful?
4494250 4496375 What did you do to her?
4496458 4498541 Did you cast a spell?
4500541 4502208 What’s going to happen to her?
4502291 4504166 Well, once she eats the apple,
4504250 4507291 its magic will turn her<br />into a magic apple tree.
4507375 4510416 <i>Gong! First bell. Nothing really happens,<br />but very dramatic.</i>
4510500 4513041 <i>The tree bears fruit at the second bell.</i>
4513125 4515375 <i>Gong! Excitement mounts!</i>
4515458 4520000 <i>The morning sun touches the fruit,<br />turning it into a new pair of red shoes.</i>
4520083 4523291 Gong number three! The circle of life!
4523375 4524458 And then what?
4524541 4529458 Regina will be the most beautiful person<br />in the kingdom. Forever.
4529541 4532333 I don’t care about her!<br />What about Snow White?
4532416 4536666 The tree withers and dies.<br />And so does Snow White.
4536750 4538333 No!
4538416 4540750 Yes!
4540833 4545000 Oh, I’m rotting! I’m dying.
4561500 4564750 Why don’t you come back and play.
4571000 4572208 Not so fast.
4581958 4583416 It’s gonna hurt.
4586583 4588291 Oh, yeah!
4588375 4589541 Stretch it out.
4601416 4602250 Uh-oh.
4606958 4608208 Smoke! Smoke!
4608291 4610000 We’re here, mate. Are you okay?
4610083 4611125 Yeah
4612416 4614750 I never thought I’d say this,
4614833 4617333 but I’m so glad<br />to be chubby and green again.
4618125 4622833 Seven to one, I like those odds. Let’s go.
4624458 4626958 We like those odds even better.
4629125 4630750 Are you up to this, muchacho?
4630833 4634625 Wow. You finally pulled out Excalibur!
4634708 4638875 Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, I did it,<br />that’s exactly how it went down.
4638958 4641291 Here you go, Merlin,<br />you’re gonna need these.
4641375 4642583 Thanks.
4648041 4650166 Here comes the sun.
4650750 4652875 Now let’s all get dwarfed!
4657041 4661083 This is where<br />your fairy tale ends, trolls!
4665458 4666416 You missed.
4703458 4705250 Au revoir, mirror!
4720250 4721375 Finally…
4730083 4732666 It’s a good day to break a curse!
4734375 4736541 …eternal beauty.
4750083 4753000 <i>I’m sorry, Snow White.</i>
4756125 4759500 No!
4786083 4788625 Extraordinary, no more carrots for me.
4790666 4791750 Woah!
4794541 4796208 -Woah! We’re back!<br />-Yay!
4796291 4797125 Yippee!
4807500 4808583 Papa?
4818791 4819916 Snow White?
4822291 4823458 Oh, Papa!
4823541 4824666 Snow!
4829750 4830708 Wait.
4830791 4832416 Where’s Merlin?
4832500 4834291 I’m so sorry.
4834375 4838250 He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
4838750 4840166 Merlin, no!
4843333 4844791 Merlin!
4844875 4847083 <i>Merlin! Merlin…</i>
4905583 4907375 I thought you were gone.
4908333 4912291 You’re the most beautiful woman<br />in the world.
4914458 4919958 Whether my eyes are open or closed.
4931041 4931916 No.
4949541 4950791 I got Merlin’d.
4976625 4978583 You’re Prince Merlin.
4985833 4988916 Yeah. That Merlin.
4989000 4992125 The one who’s not really your type.
4995583 4998166 I kinda liked the short and green Merlin.
5000666 5002625 But I’m still that Merlin inside.
5004083 5004916 Yes.
5005583 5006791 Yes, you are.
5014208 5015458 -Yeah!<br />-Yay!
5015541 5017041 Wow!
5025500 5027041 Any idea who that girl is?
5173041 5174125 Not again.
