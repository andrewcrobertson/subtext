24550 27675 This, is Fairy Tale Island.
28008 31258 A magical land of princes and princesses
31758 33467 witches and monsters.
34383 38800 Accidents and strange events<br />happen all the time.
38967 41342 And that's when people call us.
41717 46425 The Fearless Seven, the greatest<br />heroes on Fairy Tale Island.
46467 48758 Especially me, Merlin.
49467 53383 But everything changed<br />the day we defeated a dragon
53592 55300 and saved a Princess.
56967 61092 We thought we'd saved a witch,<br />so, we attacked her.
61550 64300 But we were wrong.
64717 68258 She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.
68300 70633 The Fairy Princess!
70967 73526 How were we supposed to know?<br />She looks like a witch,
73550 76675 and everyone knows that a<br />princess doesn't look like a witch.
77717 82258 Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,<br />so she put a curse on us.
82467 84425 And this was a nasty one.
84592 89008 That turned us into little ugly green<br />monsters whenever people looked at us.
89425 91300 And the only way to break the curse
91342 95342 is to get a kiss from the<br />most beautiful woman in the world.
95883 97675 Are you kidding me?
97758 99425 With this face?
146633 148217 Hello, your majesty.
148342 151092 - Good morning ma'am.<br />- Good morning ma'am.
155008 158967 Magic tree, magic tree...
159217 165050 Let this morning be the time<br />that you perform your duty,
170342 178342 of bringing me the shoes<br />of youthful eternal... beauty.
186592 187592 Yes!
188883 190592 Change me!
192967 194425 Finally!
199342 201467 Not again! How long must I wait?
201592 203276 - No.<br />- Clear these away.
203300 204068 Uh-oh.
204092 204883 Heads off.
205050 206633 Pull yourself together.
210425 211467 Here you are.
212300 214425 Oh? Thanks!
237842 241092 That wasn't here before.<br />What is she up to now?
260883 261883 Huh?
282592 283592 Huh?
287425 288925 You weren't here before.
293550 294550 Whatever.
299175 300508 Oh! Oww!
304675 305675 Yes!
308800 313217 I can't believe my beloved daughter<br />Snow White has turned eighteen.
313383 319092 I only wish her mother could see the kind of<br />smart and beautiful young woman she's become.
319675 322550 Strange thing happened during the party.
322758 326467 The castle guards brought in<br />a woman named Regina.
326675 332467 They said she was a witch,<br />but she was too beautiful to be a witch.
332550 337008 I have married Regina.<br />Everything feels so perfect!
337592 344008 Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.<br />There's something not quite right.
344633 348883 People around the castle have been<br />disappearing, one by one.
349050 351675 Is it because of that peculiar mirror?
351758 356717 I saw it with my own eyes,<br />Regina talking to a tree.
356758 359092 She must be a witch!
359592 363425 I should send Snow away to a safer place.
363467 368675 My dear Snow, by the time you read this,<br />my fate will be uncertain.
369008 370842 She's coming for me now.
370967 375633 I only hope you can find the<br />Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.
377300 378383 Apples...
378467 381508 the most suspicious of fruits.
383133 384110 Oh,
384134 387217 Papa, where are you?
390925 392508 But they don't look dangerous.
409675 410300 Regina?
410342 413508 No, my shoes! Get her!
422842 424175 - Can I borrow this?<br />- Okay.
424217 425217 Thanks!
439633 440800 What?
442092 444467 Nooo!
452008 454592 Short, chubby, and green.
455842 457467 Green is like an ogre.
457508 460717 Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.<br />And cuddly.
461050 463592 Quit your complaining, Merlin!
463717 467425 I'm figuring out how to take this curse<br />and kick it where the sun don't shine.
467633 472050 Listen, we need to find the most<br />beautifullest princess to kiss us,
472175 474092 and we've just about run out of options.
474592 479133 How would a beautiful woman<br />even see you, Mister Invisible?
481967 484133 - What was that?<br />- Some kind of bird?
488883 491800 Magic mirror, full of wisdom,
491925 494967 who's the fairest in the Kingdom?
495300 498217 The woman who wears the red shoes.
500300 503175 And side note, wisdom and<br />kingdom don't really rhyme.
503217 506967 Cut the sass and tell me her name!
507967 509842 How should I know?<br />I don't get out much.
509925 512175 Well, you are the magic mirror.
512342 516842 Magic is just my first name,<br />it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.
516883 519300 What can you do then?
519467 523883 I just reflect what I see,<br />the truth. The truth is,
523967 528800 that you should see yourself right now.<br />Right now!
530217 531300 Watch it.
531925 536967 Distribute wanted posters to every town,<br />village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,
537092 538800 and find her!
540592 542300 I feel my power draining.
542425 546258 I don't have much time.<br />The aging is accelerating.
546550 549675 And only three bumbling<br />bits of kindling for help.
549800 553883 Perhaps you should recruit another, someone<br />who stands to gain from your success.
553925 555925 What about this fellow?
556758 558967 Interesting.
559467 563592 Tell me more, Magichard.
564633 566758 Hey hey, Over here! Over here!
566800 568300 See, see. Come! Very quick.
568342 569800 Look at this. Look, look, look.
570925 571925 What is it?
576467 578633 I know a lot about silhouettes,
578842 581008 and I think this shape is a witch.
581050 584467 Let's not jump to conclusions.<br />Yes, it could be a witch.
584550 585425 Or
585550 586425 Ya. It's a witch
586550 588508 The witch who cursed us?
588592 590592 Let's catch her and make<br />her break the spell!
609467 609883 En garde!
609925 611842 Wands where I can see 'em, witch!
620842 621819 Fraulein!
621843 622883 No No No! Stop!
622925 625217 I get you some revenge!
629092 630175 Beautiful!
630508 633342 I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.
633425 634967 How did she end up with us?
642383 646175 Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my<br />home slash command post.
646217 648842 I have six room mates<br />but my name's on the lease.
648883 650300 I pay the rent.
650508 654883 Your home? Oh my gosh,<br />I am... I am so sorry.
655050 656800 I was starving and...
656842 658842 No need to apologize.
659092 661717 We didn't mean to interrupt<br />your stolen meal.
661758 664925 If you're still hungry,<br />I can whip up something simple.
664967 667050 - You see I, marinate the solution and...
667092 668217 Who is that?
669550 670527 Uhh...
670551 671800 Who?
678592 681758 Wow. I look so different.
682092 684800 I mean, my face, and my waist,<br />and my waist and...
684842 685925 My waist?
686550 689550 Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
694592 699092 Oh, I must've gotten up so<br />quickly my back is killing me.
700008 701842 You mean your head, right?
702383 705800 - Do you need help?<br />- No, I'm fine.
709383 713592 Is that really what I look like?<br />In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?
713758 715425 You're beautiful, miss.
715550 717133 Like an angel!
717300 718300 Really?
719425 720592 Could it be?
720800 722717 Excuse me, but who are you?
722758 724258 Oh... I'm Snow...
724508 725383 Snot?
725467 727008 No no no no no no.
728467 730300 My name is...
731092 732467 R-Red Shoes.
733883 736758 Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.
736800 741383 Cool name, but, by any chance<br />would that be Princess Red Shoes?
741425 743175 Of course, she's a princess!
743217 746175 How could she be so<br />beautiful if she weren't?
746217 748133 Obviously! Right, miss?
748217 751175 Obviously, I mean I am a princess.
752300 753675 Who are you guys?
753717 755800 I'm Merlin.
755883 758342 Part time hero, full time romantic.
759217 762467 And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,<br />Pino, Noki and Kio.
762508 766092 No way, your names are<br />the same as the F-Seven.
766217 768925 The Fearless Seven.<br />I'm looking for them.
768967 771758 Let me guess,<br />Merlin's your favourite?
772633 774758 No, not really.
774800 776967 No, that Merlin's not your type.
777050 779967 You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
780092 783633 Honestly, none of them are<br />really my type.
785383 786360 Oh.
786384 788300 Well. That's fine.
788467 791717 Because we're not them, we're<br />actually completely different people.
791758 796508 In no way are we the same guys, put under<br />a curse, and changed into different forms.
796550 799717 But only if someone looks at us,<br />It's very complicated.
799758 800758 Right. We're all clear.
801842 804508 So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
804800 806508 I need to find my father,
806633 808508 and I know that the F-Seven can help.
809175 813508 We know the F-Seven very well,<br />and their schedule is fully booked.
813675 816508 Leave it to me,<br />I'll find your father within the month.
816550 818133 I can do it in one week.
818175 819883 - Four days!<br />- Three days!
819925 821217 - Two days!<br />- One!
821300 822175 Oomph!
822217 824425 I already found your<br />father like, two weeks ago.
824508 825592 Really?
825675 828633 I just need a few days<br />to get him across state lines.
828675 830675 I seriously need to find my dad.
830717 835133 Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven<br />in over a year, right?
835258 838592 You're not going to find them now,<br />we're your best bet.
839967 843342 Wow. No-ones offered to<br />help me for such a long time.
844342 845467 You guys are awesome
845508 848842 Really? You think we are awesome?
848883 854175 Yeah, you guys are<br />caring, and sweet, and...
854217 857050 And not completely hideous to look at?
857217 860425 No, you guys are totally adorable.
860467 862342 I think I hit her too hard.
862383 865258 But she is beautiful.
866425 868883 She can help me break the curse.
873883 877133 Who is coming to my birthday party?
877217 879092 Has Ariel RSVP'd?
879133 881800 She says she can't make it, sir.<br />She has to wax her legs.
881842 883133 But she's a mermaid!
883217 884342 What about Sleeping Beauty?
884383 885592 Doctor's appointment.
885633 887758 - Is she sick?<br />- Says she has insomnia.
887800 890050 If she's not gonna sleep,<br />she can come to our party.
890092 891092 What about Rapunzel?
891133 894258 And don't tell me she's<br />getting her hair done.
894300 897508 Nope. It's something called, uh, book.
897592 898550 Princess Cruise?
898592 899717 That's a ship, sir.
899758 900425 Princess Leia?
900467 901609 She's a general!
901633 904383 I demand glorious guests!
904592 907842 How can I be any more unpopular!
907883 910550 And I don't understand, why?
913050 915842 Greetings, Prince Average.
915883 918425 It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.
918550 919925 Sure it is.
920217 923800 If you're here for the 'We Love<br />Our Peasants' group giveaway,
923842 926717 that motion is ended.<br />Grab your wrinkles and go.
926883 927883 Move along.
932133 935717 Do you think that people would respect you,
935758 942633 if you celebrated your birthday with<br />a beautiful woman on your arm?
942925 946092 Finally, someone talking sense!
946133 947967 This horrible crone gets it!
948008 950675 May I suggest inviting
951050 953258 this young lady?
954342 957092 She's beautiful, when can she get here?
957133 958967 Well, that's up to you.
959092 962675 You see, she's stolen something from me.
962883 968758 You find her, bring her along with you,<br />and you won't look like such a loser,
968925 972050 and I get my shoes back.
972217 974217 Fear not, loyal hag.
974258 976383 I, Prince Average,
976508 980383 shall find this fugitive,<br />and make her pay for her crimes,
980508 982550 by making her attend my birthday party.
983675 986092 There shall be balloons!
986175 989550 I just thought of it.<br />Let's have a lot of balloons!
989883 991758 What a buffoon.
1000342 1002300 It looks just like papa.
1008133 1009717 Papa won't recognise me.
1015633 1020050 Why won't... why won't these<br />shoes just come off?
1026675 1029383 Yes, this is me.
1037675 1041342 Would you like to join me<br />in a moisturising mask?
1041508 1044467 Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...
1045383 1046360 Oh!
1046384 1047425 So tired.
1047467 1048758 Are you sure?
1048925 1051717 It's very important to take<br />care of your skin.
1051758 1052758 Positive.
1054883 1058258 But this is the finest French<br />recipe meant to hydrate skin.
1058675 1060967 It is made of French poopee!
1062300 1063300 Papa?
1064467 1068800 Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.
1069092 1070550 Oh, there it is.
1070883 1073175 Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?
1073217 1075425 Have you checked in the kitchen?
1075592 1078967 Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!
1081467 1083383 Now, where was I?
1084175 1086425 Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?
1088008 1089383 - It's nowhere to be...<br />- No!
1089425 1092592 Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.<br />Now please, go away.
1092633 1094717 Someone's got anger management issues.
1098800 1101383 Getting a kiss was never<br />a problem with this face.
1104217 1105217 Red Shoes?
1107258 1108592 Papa?
1109258 1111008 Papa? Are you there?
1111925 1112967 Papa?
1135883 1140175 Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are<br />the way to a woman's heart.
1142508 1145675 It works! I call it, an auto portrait.
1145717 1147342 I call it, the duplicatertron.
1147383 1148842 I call it, selfie!
1148883 1150550 Red Shoes must love it!
1150592 1152050 Monsieur, monsieur.
1152092 1154758 She doesn't want sweets and selfies.
1154925 1157258 Women want diamonds.
1157508 1158508 Merlin?
1164758 1168550 The Book of Spells To<br />Make You Fall In Love?
1172675 1176342 Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.
1176383 1177842 You're a nice bunny.
1178633 1180842 You're a Vegan bunny, right?
1184425 1186800 What was that? Lightning?
1186925 1189425 Actually, it's called magic. I do it.
1189467 1191717 Really? Then do some!
1212425 1215258 Keep running, and whatever<br />you do, don't look back.
1215300 1216592 But I can't leave without you.
1216842 1219092 You're looking back. Don't do that.
1219300 1220300 But...
1221050 1222925 Hate to zap you longears,
1223133 1225592 But I need to impress a beautiful woman.
1225758 1227925 Big, scary bunny! Over here!
1227967 1229967 Red! Stop putting yourself in...
1232175 1233842 danger...
1253592 1255300 Arthur! I got you.
1255550 1258008 It's no use, Red Shoes.
1258050 1261717 I'm slippin' away. Not much time...
1261758 1264883 Just... need to... use that core of mine...
1264925 1267425 I see the light at the end of the funnel.
1267675 1271133 Time for me to kick the bucket
1271175 1273175 I had a good run. I was God blessed.
1273217 1277217 Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!
1277425 1280592 Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
1280633 1283675 Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.
1283925 1286633 Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.
1286675 1288925 And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.
1288967 1291217 No, No, No. I'm fine,<br />but Arthur, he's stuck.
1291258 1292717 He tried to save me and...
1292758 1294217 Would you get up?
1294633 1296258 What? He's not hurt?
1296425 1298842 - Only his pride.<br />- Seriously Arthur?
1298967 1301383 You need to find a better<br />way to hit on girls.
1310717 1313592 Stand back! I may have to risk my life.
1322883 1324758 Someone call for three inventors?
1324925 1326383 For three geniuses?
1326967 1328467 That sounds like us!
1329717 1333175 Everyone came runnin' to help,<br />great, just great.
1333217 1334925 Everyone except Merlin, that is.
1334967 1337175 Ah! Super, there he is now.
1337800 1338675 Where have you been?
1338717 1341467 Something awful could've happened<br />to Red if I hadn't shown up.
1341508 1342592 You?
1343342 1345550 Don't even go there!
1345925 1348092 I saved her first.
1349217 1351133 - Right?<br />- I was worried about you.
1351258 1353175 I was worried about me too.
1353508 1356342 - But mostly you.<br />- No-one needs to worry.
1356383 1358633 Arthur's here. Please, my lady.
1358758 1360050 Um... Okay.
1369300 1371383 You shouldn't go into the<br />forest by yourself.
1371592 1376633 It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for<br />bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
1377050 1378175 And squirrels.
1378342 1380050 I thought I saw my father.
1380717 1383467 Turned out, just to be that big bunny.
1383633 1387633 Well, if you ever make such a dangerous<br />and weird mistake again,
1387800 1389967 just know that I can protect you.
1390467 1391758 This's very kind.
1391800 1396425 And if you really want to express<br />your gratitude, you can...
1398217 1400675 Oh, I am so sorry.
1400717 1406008 This was much slappier than<br />I intended it to be.
1406383 1408800 Oh! It happens. No problem.
1409508 1411758 Maybe an apology kiss then?
1414383 1415800 Bravo mon ami!
1416300 1417675 Nice try.
1418342 1419883 Red Shoes.
1424633 1428092 Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going<br />to have to work as a tightly knit team.
1428217 1430133 Which means, you do everything I say.
1430217 1431758 - Excuse?<br />- Huh? - What? - No.
1431800 1432550 You got to be kidding.
1432592 1434842 Hans and Jack will search<br />around the Dismal Lake.
1434925 1437800 Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.
1437925 1440967 Red Shoe and I, will go<br />to Golden Goose Avenue.
1441092 1445758 Golden Goose Avenue, which happens<br />to be your go to place for dates.
1445883 1448092 We are going to focus on the mission.
1448258 1450550 And then see where the evening takes us.
1450842 1455008 The only thing you're going to shop for<br />on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.
1455050 1456717 And you can't even afford that.
1456883 1459467 I like my odds. You saw what she did.
1459508 1461842 An expression of affection.
1462008 1463842 Every woman shows it differently.
1463967 1465467 You took your shot. You got slapped.
1465508 1466550 May I remind you
1466592 1470467 that this is the closest thing to a<br />kiss anyone's had since the curse.
1471550 1475133 Let's work together to guide<br />Red Shoes' feelings towards me
1475175 1477008 so we can break the curse.
1477050 1478342 What about the rest of us?
1478383 1480883 After I resume my princely form,
1481050 1483508 the word about F-Seven will be out.
1483550 1487300 Ladies will be begging<br />to kiss your green mugs.
1487383 1489175 - Really?<br />- Sounds reasonable.
1489258 1490758 I'll bring the gelato!
1490800 1493383 Getting one kiss sure is easier<br />than getting seven.
1493467 1496342 This is not a plan,<br />he's just out for himself!
1496383 1498383 A half baked plan is better than none.
1498425 1502008 Don't worry Merlin,<br />I have a big assignment for you.
1502675 1504258 Big assignment?
1504592 1506758 Here you go. I drew these up last night.
1507133 1510508 I can't tell if this<br />drawing is terrible, or
1511133 1512842 really avant garde.
1512967 1515175 Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.
1515342 1516717 Pablo Picassover?
1516758 1520550 One thing's for sure,<br />daddy's on the big side...
1521133 1522717 of big.
1523883 1525300 You must take after your mother.
1525508 1526828 No, I look a lot like papa... Oh!
1527758 1534008 Yeah, my mother. Gosh!<br />We... exactly! Twins!
1534842 1537675 Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.
1537717 1540508 Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!
1542967 1544467 And where d'ya think you're going?
1544800 1546508 Your post is right there.
1546592 1549175 You'll watch the savage monster.<br />I call him Vicious!
1549217 1550758 I call him Woodbottom.
1550842 1553258 Do not worry Merlin. We'll make<br />sure you get kissed too.
1553508 1554717 Eventually.
1556300 1557508 We'll split up here.
1557550 1559300 Alright, see you later.
1560175 1563133 I know exactly where we should<br />look to find your father.
1563383 1564883 Really? Where?
1572925 1574050 Daddy!
1574342 1575342 Wow!
1576342 1577508 Is this what I think it is?
1577550 1583592 I present Excalibur, the legendary<br />sword trapped in this rock for centuries.
1583967 1587342 Waiting for a man of great<br />strength to release it.
1587383 1590633 It says 'Do not attempt<br />to remove by force'.
1590717 1593217 Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.
1593550 1599633 The truth is, I realized you were the woman<br />of my destiny the first time I saw you.
1599967 1602675 I thought if I could show you my strength
1602925 1605133 I would be worthy of your affections.
1609050 1610050 Oh!
1610550 1612508 Oops, I'll put it back.
1612550 1614217 No No No! Can I have it?
1624592 1627758 Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.
1628092 1630342 You want me to, maybe pull<br />it out for you again?
1630592 1632842 No, I'm not humiliated at all.
1633633 1634675 Let's go.
1644258 1648008 Don't look at me like that,<br />I'm the real prisoner here.
1648258 1650342 What? You hungry?
1651800 1653383 And fetch!
1661342 1663092 Hop along, big guy!
1663300 1666050 There's no way Arthur is<br />breaking this curse alone!
1683008 1684092 Woah!
1685842 1687633 Arthur, where're you going?
1690883 1691883 Okay.
1692467 1693592 See you later.
1694758 1695758 Hi.
1696675 1698592 Oh, look at what you made me do!
1698675 1699717 You...
1699925 1701133 I'm sorry.
1701342 1703342 Made me make it perfect.
1703800 1704800 Thank you.
1705300 1706300 Woah!
1707383 1709175 I'm so sorry.
1709217 1712133 No, don't be. I am sorry.
1712467 1713800 Are you alright?
1713925 1714902 And...
1714926 1716717 don't worry about this.
1719967 1720633 What?
1720842 1722217 Ta-da!
1724633 1726925 Excuse me, have you seen this man?
1789425 1792217 Arthur, I was thinking.
1792258 1794967 What if I just pull out<br />the Excalibur for you?
1795008 1796508 Our secret.
1797258 1799425 Really? We have a secret now?
1799467 1800050 Yeah.
1800092 1802693 I like a girl who can<br />keep things classified.
1802717 1805008 Let's find your pops, friend.
1805217 1806217 'Bye guys.
1810300 1811300 What?
1812675 1814633 Hey, you.
1815008 1816133 No.
1817342 1818342 Hey!
1818967 1819967 Stop!
1825883 1826883 Come on!
1854217 1856425 Oh, you guys don't have to help.
1856550 1858633 That's not her. Come on.
1858675 1859675 Sorry miss.
1863467 1866133 Red Shoes! Where has she gone?
1866175 1867925 Where's Red Shoes?
1867967 1869633 That's what I'd like to know.
1870133 1871425 Wait a minute.
1871550 1873092 Who said you could leave your post?
1873133 1875175 I'm just walking the bunny.
1877633 1880008 Red Shoes, where are you?
1880175 1882383 Hey, have you seen this girl?
1888050 1889258 Look what I found
1889300 1892592 Oh, those're mine.<br />Can I, actually have my shoes back?
1895425 1897717 No way. You're not serious, are you?
1897758 1901508 I'm really not in the mood,<br />Can you just, please give them back to me?
1902342 1904008 Ha! They won't even fit on you.
1904050 1906133 They're gonna fit me better<br />than they fit you.
1906175 1907175 Hey!
1908175 1909258 Red Shoes!
1909383 1911175 Guys! Guys, I'm here.
1914758 1917842 - Red Shoes!<br />- Red Shoes! Where are you?
1919133 1921758 Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.
1924300 1927050 Those dwarfs are not hideous.
1927175 1929800 And I don't need anyone to help me.
1931800 1933675 Freeze! Put the shoes down.
1933717 1936258 Get on your knees and put<br />your hands behind your head.
1936300 1938092 On second thought, they're yours.
1938133 1941258 There's no need to push me in a corner
1941467 1943342 Super scary.
1953967 1955758 Your red shoes, milady.
1956550 1957550 Thank you.
1957758 1960425 Excuse me, miss, have we met?
1961800 1964258 Well, that's kind of a<br />complicated question.
1964383 1965758 Red Shoes!
1966383 1968925 Gotta go. Be safe.
1989133 1990133 Guys!
1992675 1994258 Where has she gone?
1995425 1996675 Red Shoes!
1997092 1998092 Stop!
2000967 2001967 Hold on!
2005550 2006550 Wait a minute.
2007717 2009883 Gotcha now, don't we?
2010800 2011800 I don't get it.
2015383 2017925 Now we know how fast a<br />bunny can hop in a pinch.
2018175 2019717 Thank you for helping me, Merlin.
2019883 2021300 A pleasure, milady.
2021717 2023800 But I also did it for us.
2024633 2027217 By the way, what is this?
2028342 2030300 Gosh, it seems silly but...
2030967 2032425 It's my shoes
2033383 2035842 - They're magical.<br />- I know, they're fabulous.
2035967 2037425 But why're they after you?
2037467 2041758 No, my shoes, they're<br />actually made of magic.
2041800 2043133 Red Shoes!
2043425 2044467 Are you a criminal?
2044800 2046592 No, of course not.
2047217 2050425 I knew a girl this pretty couldn't<br />possibly be a criminal.
2050633 2053967 Look, we should head out now, there<br />could be more guards around any minute.
2054217 2057092 Don't worry about them,<br />I've got these bad boys.
2057467 2060383 This is gonna make it so much<br />harder to find my dad.
2064342 2065383 I have an idea!
2101092 2102300 Ta-da!
2103050 2105175 Oh wow!
2109717 2110717 What do you think?
2111175 2113883 That is amazing.
2115425 2116217 Thank you.
2133217 2136217 You had a thing on your cheek.
2136258 2137342 Alright, let's go.
2157133 2160550 - We've been walking for hours.<br />- And we'll keep walking 'till we find them.
2167342 2169092 Now we got her.
2170592 2172967 - Are they gone?<br />- Shh. Who cares? -
2173175 2174675 C'mon. Let's go see.
2175633 2176717 Look at that.
2177717 2178694 - Wow!<br />- Wow!
2178718 2179758 Awsome!
2179883 2180800 Who's that?
2180842 2182217 It's the girl's father.
2182383 2183675 But where's the girl?
2183842 2186842 It says to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2187342 2188717 Why Risky Rock?
2188842 2190050 We should ask the girl.
2190092 2192467 Perfect! Where's the girl?
2192717 2196050 It says to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2196342 2198633 But, why Risky Rock?
2198800 2200026 We should ask the girl.
2200050 2201027 Umm...
2201051 2202217 Where's the girl?
2202258 2204842 It says to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2204883 2207133 But, why Risky Rock?
2207342 2208550 We should ask the girl.
2228550 2229550 Oww!
2229967 2231092 What was that for?
2231133 2234133 You, sir, are sabotaging my<br />relationship with Red Shoes.
2234175 2236425 What relationship are<br />you talking about?
2236467 2239008 Red Shoes and I share a secret.
2239050 2242008 I would tell you what it is,<br />but it's a secret.
2242133 2245550 While you're busy keeping secrets,<br />I'm going to break my curse.
2245633 2247842 You're nothing without<br />your spells, magic boy.
2247883 2250383 And you're nothing without Excalibur.
2251133 2254967 You're not waiting for someone to<br />pull it out for you, are you?
2255008 2256050 How did you know?
2256175 2257258 Is it true?
2272342 2273925 Hans, you shouldn't have.
2274050 2276883 Something sweet, for someone sweeter.
2279133 2280467 This is spectacular!
2280508 2283193 Oh, it's nothing.<br />Just let me know what you want.
2283217 2286550 Any time, for the rest of your life.<br />Do you like fondue?
2286592 2291800 Behold! Carved by the finest jewellers<br />out of all the jewellers I know
2292092 2293342 which is a lot.
2294717 2295175 Pretty.
2295217 2299800 And it's yours, Miss Shoes,<br />yours in exchange for nothing.
2299883 2300800 Make it a kiss.
2300883 2303925 That's really sweet Jack,<br />but I can't accept it.
2304175 2306967 I don't want your jewells,<br />only your good intentions.
2307008 2310425 My intentions are more than good,<br />they're super bonne.
2310508 2311592 Testing one, two.
2311675 2314425 Testing one... no,<br />I'm pushing it, you dolt.
2314467 2316633 Attention! Hideous trolls!
2316675 2319842 Is it dwarfs with an 'f',<br />or dwarves, with a 'v'?
2319883 2321443 I want to use whatever's more offensive.
2321467 2323508 Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.
2323592 2325758 I heard that! It's Avv-vous-rarge!
2325800 2326717 Oh, please.
2326758 2332133 Inside your amateurs attempt at a facade of<br />a sham of a travesty of a veneer of a castle
2332175 2335300 is a gorgeous wanted criminal.
2335383 2339925 I hereby command that all of you exit<br />the premises and surrender post haste.
2340050 2344008 Fail to comply, and you will<br />never see these two again.
2344258 2345883 You have until three.
2346175 2347175 One.
2349383 2350175 Two.
2350342 2351717 I lied. Charge!
2372342 2373717 Am I the person you want?
2373758 2375592 Yes, yes you are.
2375800 2379342 Though I don't know if you're a person<br />or a vision of beauty, some kind of angelic
2379675 2383342 thing with wings. Angelic wing things?
2383717 2387175 I will come with you,<br />but only after you release my friends.
2387383 2388383 Do it. Do it!
2390425 2393133 Now, here's the good news.<br />It's my birthday!
2393300 2396758 And you are going to be<br />the belle of the ball.
2396800 2400550 The invitation sounds great,<br />really. But...
2400633 2402883 It wasn't an invitation,<br />more of an order.
2403008 2403967 Prepare the lady's carriage.
2404008 2406550 She said she doesn't want to go, Average.
2406592 2409508 Avv-vous-rarge!
2409633 2411258 Don't troll me, Troll.
2411633 2412758 Ah! So rude.
2412800 2415050 I couldn't agree more.<br />Subjects these days.
2415092 2416217 Now. Shall we?
2424800 2425800 Get her!
2426050 2427734 You hold off the guards, and<br />I'll get her out of here.
2427758 2430800 No, I'm faster. You stay<br />here and buy us time.
2439133 2439925 Here's a thought.
2440133 2442300 Stop fighting and fight!
2443842 2444883 What's the plan?
2445925 2447383 Rescue Red Shoes.
2447425 2449342 Like the old days, guys.
2484300 2485300 Arthur!
2491300 2493467 Can we get this over with?<br />They're just dwarfs!
2505758 2508217 Did you guys hear something?
2517258 2518258 Come on!
2538633 2539633 Duck!
2545800 2548092 Hi, guards, are we taking a break?
2548175 2549300 Well, FYI
2549342 2551592 They're getting away!
2558467 2559592 No!
2565592 2567925 Who's throwin' vegetables?
2572467 2575342 Yeah! You just got Merlined!
2583508 2584508 Run!
2585925 2586925 Jack!
2597633 2598633 Duck!
2603550 2605300 I'm so sorry. You alright?
2605425 2607675 No. I'm not.
2613383 2616383 Gentlemen, he surrenders.
2616592 2617592 What?
2647592 2649008 Engines. Full power.
2649092 2650092 Shields up.
2651050 2652592 Turn on the mini frizzer.
2671342 2672842 Superhero landing!
2673008 2673967 Hooray for us!
2674008 2676383 - We did it!<br />- It was mostly me.
2676425 2677425 Yeah!
2677925 2678925 What?
2682383 2683633 You've got to be kidding.
2683717 2686217 Finally the big guns, thank you.
2686467 2687467 Fire!
2695758 2696758 Fire!
2702675 2704217 Ooh, close.
2704550 2706342 The cannonball. Not you.
2707050 2709383 Timeout, timeout.<br />Everyone, timeout.
2709758 2713050 You almost blew her up, and she can't<br />come to my party if you blow her up.
2713092 2714217 Sorry, sir.
2714592 2716050 Alright. Time back in.
2717050 2718258 Surrender monsters!
2718300 2719467 No! Wait!
2751967 2753300 Oh. That's pretty cool.
2761175 2763092 Everyone inside. And hurry!
2777050 2779467 You messed with the wrong prince.
2779633 2782300 There is nothing average<br />about Avv-vous-rarge.
2782508 2785758 I shall return!
2785967 2786883 On Tuesday.
2786925 2789258 No, wait. I'll check my calendar...
2789300 2793383 Thursday, I shall return Thursday!
2794758 2796008 We'll be ready.
2796050 2796842 And waiting.
2796925 2797883 Arrivederci!
2797925 2798925 Ciao for now!
2799008 2799758 Bye bye!
2799883 2801508 You just got dwarfed!
2801633 2803675 Is that better? I think Merlined is better.
2819883 2824425 You should have seen the look on his big<br />ugly face when bunny came running at him.
2825467 2827633 That's how you see everything, isn't it?
2827675 2828967 With my eyes?
2829175 2832050 You always talk about<br />what someone looks like.
2832133 2834633 I do? I wouldn't say that.
2834675 2837258 But I can't wait for you<br />to see the real me.
2837550 2839425 What kind of Merlin is the real you?
2839633 2841050 You might not believe it,
2841133 2844675 but the real me is famous,<br />handsome, and even popular.
2844842 2847800 Not short, stumpy and green.
2847925 2851217 Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but
2851258 2854175 you're also a wonderful<br />and charming person.
2854217 2855717 I'm not explaining it right.
2855800 2859383 If you saw the real me,<br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
2860217 2862175 I think I can see the real you.
2862800 2866008 And I like you, just as you are.
2867883 2869175 That's hilarious.
2869467 2873300 Here, close your eyes,<br />and imagine the real me.
2873800 2876300 I guarantee you, it'll be different.
2877967 2881592 I do feel something different ..
2881800 2882800 Really?
2883008 2885217 But eyes opened or closed
2885300 2887550 to me you're still Merlin.
2888925 2893467 Now tell me, who am I to you?
2894050 2895592 You're a gift.
2895717 2899925 A gift that'll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
2900633 2902717 Just like you're amazing.
2910967 2914008 Actually, I want to show you something too.
2918592 2920008 You need a hand?
2920133 2923508 Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.
2924133 2925675 One...
2925717 2927467 Two, yeah, okay, I need help.
2945758 2947234 Woah. Woah woah woah.
2947258 2949050 No thankyou.
2955133 2958300 You know what the weird thing is?<br />They're super comfortable.
2960550 2963883 Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were<br />you when the facade was falling?
2963925 2966050 I mean, that was terrifying.
2967883 2968967 What're you doing here?
2970967 2972883 I have come for my shoes.
2973175 2977526 Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.<br />But those dwarfs!
2977550 2980092 It's dwarves with a 'v'.<br />So you failed?
2980800 2984800 I did not fail, I took a timeout.
2984883 2986883 Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.
2986925 2989125 I'm going to return on Thursday,<br />we all pencilled it in.
2989175 2990175 Silence!
2990467 2991967 Have a bite.
2992508 2993967 For strength.
2994633 2998800 Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.
2998842 3001508 I don't have much time, Prince.
3001800 3005800 You could still have the<br />best birthday ever,
3005967 3007425 But remember...
3007467 3014092 What's bad for me,<br />will be very bad for you.
3020175 3021175 She's gone.
3022383 3024675 Ah! What's the worst that could happen.
3028717 3029717 It's kind of sweet.
3045967 3046967 Don't move.
3047092 3047633 Okay.
3047675 3049758 Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.
3049800 3050717 Okey doky!
3050758 3051550 Here we go!
3051592 3052717 Our pleasure.
3059967 3062443 Here we go, yeah, a little
3062467 3063633 Oooh a little over here!
3080342 3082133 Now that looks like a real home.
3082175 3084133 Yep. I could get used to that.
3084342 3085550 Uh uh. I cannot.
3089217 3092217 It's a perfect copy of my drawing.<br />That's incredible.
3093550 3094800 Let me try.
3095967 3098300 This will definitely make it easier to<br />find your dad.
3098383 3100675 Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.
3100717 3101550 It's grounded.
3101592 3102592 Why does it need to fly?
3102633 3105383 The posters are no good if we<br />can't distribute them fast.
3105633 3109550 Guys, thankyou so much for<br />everything you're doing.
3110050 3112050 - My pleasure.<br />- It's nice.
3181550 3182592 Opening doors!
3198633 3201842 You know Merlin, I feel so<br />lucky that I've met you.
3202550 3204425 I feel the same way.
3204842 3208175 I feel like anything is possible.
3224425 3226550 Merlin! Watch out!
3237550 3238967 Merlin.
3240800 3241842 Merlin.
3243133 3244133 Merlin!
3244550 3246050 Everything okay?
3246467 3247675 Of course! Sure!
3248467 3249734 Nothing to be embarrassed about.
3249758 3253967 So why are we even talking about<br />that when we should be going...
3254008 3255008 this direction.
3255175 3256175 Hey wait!
3259883 3262800 So, about these magic shoes.
3262967 3264193 Why, are they still bothering you?
3264217 3266217 What kind of magic do<br />those shoes have?
3266592 3269592 Well .. How do I put this.
3269800 3273550 Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.
3273967 3276175 And, I was always proud of that.
3276217 3281258 But, the shoes magic, umm,<br />it made me a little dainty?
3281383 3282425 Sorry to hear.
3282467 3286758 The shoes made me lose<br />a little bit of weight.
3286967 3288175 It could be worse.
3288217 3289550 Okay.
3290550 3292133 - A lot of weight.<br />- Ah.
3293217 3297342 Well, I know what it's like to look different<br />on the outside from what you feel on the inside.
3302008 3306050 Merlin, I'd like to give you a<br />token of my appreciation.
3307467 3309467 Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.
3309675 3310175 Why?
3310217 3312842 Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.
3314050 3315050 Give me a second.
3327467 3331342 There. Consider it your good luck charm.
3334800 3335883 Thank you.
3342425 3346217 Merlin, do you think we'd be happier
3346508 3348717 if we were our old selves again?
3348883 3351633 Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.
3351800 3353050 I don't know.
3354175 3355758 I like how we are.
3356508 3359883 Right here, just, right now.
3360550 3364258 Even if I'm an ugly green monster?
3365758 3369342 I don't care about your height<br />or what colour you are.
3370258 3373800 And that's the way you<br />feel about me, right?
3373925 3377050 Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!
3378717 3382508 I think we're both just trapped<br />under the same spell.
3398758 3404883 Wait. Keep your eyes closed<br />and don't open them until I say.
3405050 3407133 When you open your eyes there will be...
3407342 3410008 a handsome man in front of you.
3410050 3411508 Someone worthy of you.
3411550 3413758 Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.
3414967 3416133 I think you're right.
3416217 3418758 Ready? And...
3419092 3422258 Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!
3424758 3425758 Now!
3426217 3427383 Ta-da!
3427550 3430550 You just got Merlined!
3430758 3431925 What do you think?
3432342 3435592 Mission impossibly handsome, right?
3437342 3440717 Oh, it's okay,<br />I know this is a lot to take in.
3441050 3443592 But you can let your happiness flag fly.
3443633 3447550 This, this is the real me.
3448467 3450550 - It's stupid.<br />- What?
3451717 3452925 Wait a minute!
3453383 3455925 My hands are still green sausages.
3457050 3459217 No! I look the same.
3459467 3462008 Yes, impossibly handsome.
3462050 3464217 This doesn't make sense.
3464342 3467342 You're the most beautiful woman in<br />the world, why do I look the same?
3467550 3469467 What're you talking about, Merlin?
3469508 3470925 Do I need a longer kiss?
3471383 3472383 Two kisses?
3473258 3474842 Let's try again.
3475383 3476360 Umm.
3476384 3477800 You're not making any sense.
3487050 3488050 Hurry!
3490008 3491008 What is that?
3491300 3493883 This kingdom has a serious<br />monster problem.
3509758 3510300 Are you alright?
3510342 3512258 No. I'm not.
3520758 3521383 Thank you.
3521425 3522675 Pleasure, milady.
3525008 3526008 Watch out!
3543633 3545675 Ha-hah! Yes!
3551758 3554217 What do they want,<br />besides smashing us?
3554258 3555258 I don't know!
3564258 3565800 The old me would've nailed that.
3574300 3575675 You just got Merlined!
3586633 3587633 Hurry!
3603008 3604467 Red, close your eyes.
3604508 3606342 This is no time for kissing, Merlin.
3606383 3608508 Trust me. Close your eyes.
3609717 3611383 Please, close them!
3616050 3617467 That was too close.
3618258 3619675 Don't look at me.
3619842 3621842 You see that tree on the<br />other side of the bridge?
3621883 3622467 Yeah.
3622508 3625508 On my signal, run towards<br />it as fast as you can.
3625550 3627050 No, I can't leave you here.
3627217 3630425 You have to.<br />And don't look back, okay?
3630592 3632967 Look right at that<br />tree until I say it's safe.
3633092 3634675 Promise you won't look.
3634717 3637175 Okay. I promise.
3637758 3638758 Now!
3670217 3671217 What?
3671258 3673550 You just got Merlined?<br />Oh. Yes you did.
3702550 3704258 Hey! Locate!
3705300 3707050 Hey, locate here!
3707342 3710383 You're even more of a blockhead<br />than Prince Average.
3712592 3715050 Avv-vous-rarge!
3715342 3716800 Prince Average?
3733050 3734633 You just got Merlined.
3738217 3739550 Take a look, Red Shoes.
3739883 3740425 Merlin!
3740467 3742925 I have triumphantly saved the day.
3744092 3745092 Merlin, no!
3747508 3748800 Merlin!
3753633 3754925 Merlin!
3819675 3821175 Snow White?
3830675 3832342 Snow White?
3832675 3835550 The thief was Snow White<br />this whole time?
3835633 3839133 Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
3840925 3843383 You're going after her yourself?
3843467 3845008 What? Were you going to go?
3845717 3848217 I get it! I don't have legs.
3850800 3854175 So, here I am.
3855258 3856425 All the real me.
3858050 3859467 I bet you're disappointed, huh?
3859675 3862717 You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.
3862758 3863300 Red Shoes!
3863342 3866675 That's not my name, it's Snow White.
3866800 3869300 Princess Snow White? So your father is...
3869342 3871758 King White, yeah.
3872092 3875633 By the time I figured out his<br />new wife Regina was a witch
3876675 3878508 he'd already disappeared.
3879050 3881550 And the monsters who attacked us
3881592 3885592 were sent by my stepmother<br />to get these shoes.
3886883 3889842 I guess being beautiful is really<br />worth that much to her.
3890175 3893092 Have you thought about<br />just giving them back?
3894092 3895717 And give up their magic?
3896925 3900508 If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't<br />have helped me find my father, would you?
3901467 3902800 Would you?
3906592 3909050 I thought we were both<br />under the same spell.
3910300 3913592 But I see now that I was wrong.
3914008 3919508 Listen, I can't get into all the details,<br />but I'm under a curse too.
3919925 3921842 You still don't get it, Merlin.
3923050 3925550 I'm not talking about our curses.
3926258 3929050 Merlin, I'm talking about<br />the kind of spell
3930258 3932342 you never want to break.
3981008 3983508 He likes you more than he likes me.
4015383 4018717 What would've happened if she'd taken<br />off her shoes that day in the barn?
4018758 4020175 You think that's important?
4022758 4024484 I just wonder,
4024508 4027508 what I would've done if I'd<br />seen the real Snow White.
4027758 4029133 Seriously?
4029217 4031508 It's still all about appearance for you.
4031717 4034425 No! Not exactly.
4035425 4038258 But I can't live looking like<br />you for the rest of my life
4038425 4042717 Kind of proving my point, other me.<br />Alright. Let's try this.
4043217 4045883 Who do you like more,<br />Snow White or Red Shoes?
4046050 4047967 Easy, it's Red Shoes.
4048133 4050800 Now, which of us do you<br />think Red Shoes likes more?
4050883 4052592 Easy, it's me!
4054508 4057133 Wait. No.
4057717 4058883 It's...
4059258 4060300 you.
4096383 4097633 You're a gift.
4097925 4099609 A gift that'll transform me
4099633 4101967 into someone amazing.
4122967 4126925 Well, I know what it's like to look different<br />on the outside to what we feel on the inside.
4146717 4147883 Look at that!
4152550 4155592 The shoes. You're wearing them.
4155633 4157342 I thought you left.
4157550 4159092 You should take them off again.
4164383 4165383 I can't.
4166175 4169133 You just had to make things complicated.
4170175 4171550 Maybe this will help.
4171758 4174092 Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.
4174133 4175258 Where did you get that?
4175550 4177842 I want to help you, Snow White.
4178092 4179092 Please.
4185758 4186758 Red Shoes?
4187342 4188342 Merlin?
4189258 4190258 Merlin?
4193092 4195550 What terrible timing you have.
4198550 4200550 We're gonna have to do this the hard way.
4201258 4202258 Regina?
4205675 4208633 Such a tender family reunion.
4208967 4211092 So sad we can't stay!
4211925 4213008 Red Shoes!
4215467 4217383 Come on, let's go, longears.
4217425 4218967 Hey! Wait for us!
4219008 4221050 How 'bout you go back<br />and get the others?
4221217 4223175 And make lots of copies of this.
4223758 4224758 Let's go!
4227258 4228592 We can do this.
4228633 4229633 Yeah!
4232050 4234508 Your power my lady. It has drained you.
4234592 4238467 You think? I don't need<br />you to tell me how I look.
4238633 4240842 I'm a mirror. It's what I do.
4240883 4243758 I can't spell.
4243800 4244800 Enough.
4245967 4247217 Bind her.
4248258 4250383 It's snack time.
4254008 4256217 How can you sleep at<br />a time like this?
4257883 4260550 I'm not supposed to talk<br />when I have this on,
4260592 4264008 but I got to ask.<br />Do you think they've kissed yet?
4264092 4265092 I hope so,
4265175 4268133 because it'll feel better to<br />punch Merlin when he's pretty.
4269342 4272508 We've been waiting for a...<br />Where have you been?
4272550 4273568 Did you break the curse yet?
4273592 4275258 Merlin, are you hungry?
4275467 4276592 Those are bears.
4276633 4277610 Ah...
4277634 4280508 Hi? This is from Merlin.
4298883 4300842 Wow! This is so cool.
4304717 4306092 Okay, sword.
4306258 4311050 If you think you've humiliated,<br />embarrassed, and otherwise frustrated me,
4311550 4312717 you're right.
4313217 4316883 But that ends now!
4326467 4328508 Oh, zut alors. Please end this.
4340133 4344217 Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.
4344258 4345592 The castle's over there.
4362508 4363508 Sit.
4375133 4378967 Eat this darling, and you'll<br />get your freedom.
4379133 4380467 Where is my father?
4381133 4385133 Royal loyal little girl,<br />pining for her papa?
4385550 4389842 This is getting a little boring, so I need<br />you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.
4389967 4391383 I won't let you win.
4391800 4395258 You've torn apart my family,<br />and you will not get away with it, Regina.
4396300 4399133 Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.
4399425 4402383 Very well. A different approach.
4411050 4412050 - Merlin!<br />- No!
4412508 4415050 Eat the apple, or watch him die.
4415217 4416092 That's your choice.
4416133 4418008 Don't do it. No!
4418050 4419925 No!
4421383 4422360 Red Shoes!
4422384 4424633 Promise to me, you'll let him go.
4424800 4428092 Oh absolutely.<br />When the third bell chimes,
4428300 4431217 everything will be just<br />like it used to be.
4431342 4433633 No! No no no.
4435842 4437633 Save my papa for me.
4448092 4449592 Red Shoes!
4464383 4469008 A legendary handsome knight,<br />fearless rescuer of princesses.
4469133 4474217 Sitting in a tree,<br />not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.
4475383 4477050 Burn. I can't spell.
4479383 4480842 You don't have to do this.
4480883 4482967 Just take the shoes and let us go.
4483425 4486175 I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.
4486300 4489300 The fruit of temptation and want.<br />They feed on your desires
4489342 4493800 Once they give you what you desire,<br />the bond is permanent.
4494008 4496258 That's not true. She took<br />them off in the river.
4496342 4498008 That doesn't make any sense.
4498050 4502675 How could she possibly want to save you<br />more than she wanted to be beautiful?
4502925 4505008 What did you do to her?
4505258 4507175 Did you cast a spell?
4509300 4510842 What's going to happen to her?
4510883 4515800 Well, once she eats the apple, its magic<br />will turn her into a magic apple tree.
4515842 4518925 The first bell, nothing really happens,<br />but very dramatic.
4519133 4521425 The tree bears fruit,<br />and the second bell...
4521467 4523675 Oh! Excitement mounts!
4523925 4525883 The morning sun touches the fruit
4526008 4528592 turning it into a new<br />pair of red shoes
4528633 4531592 And number three, the circle of life!
4531967 4532967 And then what?
4533092 4536592 Regina will be the most<br />beautiful person in the kingdom.
4536967 4537883 Forever.
4537925 4540800 I don't care about her,<br />what about Snow White?
4540967 4545175 The tree withers and dies,<br />and so does Snow White.
4545217 4547008 No!
4547133 4548842 Yes!
4549633 4553383 Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.
4570258 4573092 Why don't you come back and play?
4579425 4580800 Not so fast.
4590550 4591675 It's gonna hurt.
4595342 4598383 Oh yeah! Stretch it out.
4609967 4611175 Uh-oh.
4615467 4616633 Smoke! Smoke!
4616842 4618800 We're here, bitch. Are you okay?
4618842 4620300 Yeah.
4620883 4622883 I never thought I'd say this,
4623592 4625883 but I'm so glad to be chubby<br />and green again.
4626675 4629883 Seven to one.<br />I like those odds.
4630092 4631133 Let's go.
4633092 4635092 We like those odds even better.
4637925 4639675 Are you up to this, muchacho?
4640842 4643217 You finally pulled out Excalibur.
4643342 4647467 Oh, yes, yes. I did it.<br />That's exactly how it went down.
4647508 4649758 Here you go Merlin.<br />You're gonna need these.
4649800 4650800 Thanks.
4656508 4658800 Here comes the sun.
4659258 4661092 Now let's all get dwarfed.
4665008 4669508 Ah, this is where your<br />fairy tale ends, trolls.
4674133 4675133 You missed.
4711967 4713717 Au revoir, mirror!
4728800 4730050 Finally.
4738717 4741425 It's a good day to break a curse.
4743092 4745300 Eternal Beauty.
4758508 4759508 I'm sorry
4760050 4761383 Snow White.
4764467 4767675 Ahhh!
4794675 4797383 Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.
4803758 4804717 Woah! We're back!
4804758 4805800 Yippee!
4816217 4817217 Papa?
4827342 4828717 Snow White?
4831008 4832092 Oh papa!
4832217 4833217 Snow!
4838467 4839467 Wait.
4839633 4840883 Where's Merlin?
4841008 4842675 I'm so sorry.
4843133 4847092 He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
4847550 4849217 Merlin, no!
4852258 4853800 Merlin!
4914258 4915883 I thought you were gone.
4916717 4921008 You're the most beautiful<br />woman in the world.
4922842 4925342 With my eyes open
4927092 4928550 or closed.
4939842 4940842 No.
4958217 4960050 I got Merlined.
4985217 4986842 You're a prince, Merlin.
4994425 4997092 Yeah, that Merlin.
4997508 5000508 The one who's not really your type.
5004258 5006842 I kind of liked the short<br />and green Merlin.
5009258 5011800 But I'm still that Merlin inside.
5012883 5015508 Yes, yes you are.
5034050 5035675 Any idea who that girl is?
5168758 5169967 Huh?
5179842 5182050 Ooh. Not Again!
