52200 55328 This, is Fairy Tale Island.
55661 58915 A magical land of princes and princesses
59416 61126 witches and monsters.
62043 66465 Accidents and strange events<br />happen all the time.
66633 69010 And that's when people call us.
69385 74099 The Fearless Seven, the greatest<br />heroes on Fairy Tale Island.
74141 76434 Especially me, Merlin.
77143 81064 But everything changed<br />the day we defeated a dragon
81273 82983 and saved a Princess.
84651 88781 We thought we'd saved a witch,<br />so, we attacked her.
89240 91992 But we were wrong.
92411 95955 She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.
95997 98332 The Fairy Princess!
98667 101253 How were we supposed to know?<br />She looks like a witch,
101253 104380 and everyone knows that a<br />princess doesn't look like a witch.
105423 109969 Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,<br />so she put a curse on us.
110178 112138 And this was a nasty one.
112305 116726 That turned us into little ugly green<br />monsters whenever people looked at us.
117144 119021 And the only way to break the curse
119063 123067 is to get a kiss from the<br />most beautiful woman in the world.
123609 125403 Are you kidding me?
125486 127154 With this face?
174414 175999 Hello, your majesty.
176124 178877 - Good morning ma'am.<br />- Good morning ma'am.
182797 186761 Magic tree, magic tree...
187011 192850 Let this morning be the time<br />that you perform your duty,
198148 206156 of bringing me the shoes<br />of youthful eternal... beauty.
214414 215415 Yes!
216708 218419 Change me!
220796 222255 Finally!
227178 229305 Not again! How long must I wait?
229430 231141 - No. - Clear these away.
231141 232142 Uh-oh.
231933 232725 Heads off.
232892 234477 Pull yourself together.
238273 239316 Here you are.
240150 242277 Oh? Thanks!
265719 268973 That wasn't here before.<br />What is she up to now?
288786 289787 Huh?
310517 311518 Huh?
315355 316856 You weren't here before.
321486 322487 Whatever.
327118 328452 Oh! Oww!
332624 333625 Yes!
336753 341175 I can't believe my beloved daughter<br />Snow White has turned eighteen.
341341 347056 I only wish her mother could see the kind of<br />smart and beautiful young woman she's become.
347640 350518 Strange thing happened during the party.
350726 354439 The castle guards brought in<br />a woman named Regina.
354647 360445 They said she was a witch,<br />but she was too beautiful to be a witch.
360528 364991 I have married Regina.<br />Everything feels so perfect!
365576 371999 Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.<br />There's something not quite right.
372624 376879 People around the castle have been<br />disappearing, one by one.
377046 379674 Is it because of that peculiar mirror?
379757 384722 I saw it with my own eyes,<br />Regina talking to a tree.
384763 387099 She must be a witch!
387599 391437 I should send Snow away to a safer place.
391479 396692 My dear Snow, by the time you read this,<br />my fate will be uncertain.
397026 398862 She's coming for me now.
398987 403657 I only hope you can find the<br />Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.
405327 406411 Apples...
406495 409539 ...the most suspicious of fruits.
411165 412167 Oh,
412167 415253 Papa, where are you?
418966 420550 But they don't look dangerous.
437735 438361 Regina?
438403 441573 No, my shoes! Get her!
450917 452251 - Can I borrow this?<br />- Okay.
452293 453294 Thanks!
467725 468894 What?
470188 472565 Nooo!
480114 482700 Short, chubby, and green.
483952 485579 Green is like an ogre.
485620 488832 Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.<br />And cuddly.
489166 491711 Quit your complaining, Merlin!
491836 495548 I'm figuring out how to take this curse<br />and kick it where the sun don't shine.
495756 500178 Listen, we need to find the most<br />beautifullest princess to kiss us,
500303 502222 and we've just about run out of options.
502722 507268 How would a beautiful woman<br />even see you, Mister Invisible?
510105 512273 - What was that?<br />- Some kind of bird?
517028 519947 Magic mirror, full of wisdom,
520072 523118 who's the fairest in the Kingdom?
523452 526371 The woman who wears the red shoes.
528457 531335 And side note, wisdom and<br />kingdom don't really rhyme.
531377 535132 Cut the sass and tell me her name!
536133 538009 How should I know?<br />I don't get out much.
538092 540344 Well, you are the magic mirror.
540512 545017 Magic is just my first name,<br />it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.
545058 547477 What can you do then?
547644 552065 I just reflect what I see,<br />the truth. The truth is,
552150 556988 that you should see yourself right now.<br />Right now!
558406 559490 Watch it.
560116 565164 Distribute wanted posters to every town,<br />village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,
565289 566998 and find her!
568792 570502 I feel my power draining.
570627 574464 I don't have much time.<br />The aging is accelerating.
574757 577885 And only three bumbling<br />bits of kindling for help.
578010 582098 Perhaps you should recruit another, someone<br />who stands to gain from your success.
582140 584142 What about this fellow?
584975 587187 Interesting.
587688 591817 Tell me more, Magichard.
592859 594987 Hey hey, Over here! Over here!
595029 596530 See, see. Come! Very quick.
596572 598032 Look at this. Look, look, look.
599158 600159 What is it?
604706 606874 I know a lot about silhouettes,
607083 609252 and I think this shape is a witch.
609294 612714 Let's not jump to conclusions.<br />Yes, it could be a witch.
612797 613673 ...Or
613798 614674 Ya. It's a witch
614800 616760 The witch who cursed us?
616844 618846 Let's catch her and make<br />her break the spell!
637741 638157 En garde!
638199 640118 Wands where I can see 'em, witch!
649127 650128 Fraulein!
650128 651171 No No No! Stop!
651213 653508 I get you some revenge!
657386 658471 Beautiful!
658805 661641 I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.
661724 663268 How did she end up with us?
670692 674488 Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my<br />home slash command post.
674530 677158 I have six room mates<br />but my name's on the lease.
677199 678617 I pay the rent.
678825 683205 Your home? Oh my gosh,<br />I am... I am so sorry.
683373 685124 I was starving and...
685166 687168 No need to apologize.
687419 690047 We didn't mean to interrupt<br />your stolen meal.
690088 693258 If you're still hungry,<br />I can whip up something simple.
693300 695386 - You see I, marinate the solution and...
695428 696554 Who is that?
697888 698889 Uhh...
698889 700140 Who?
706940 710110 Wow. I look so different.
710444 713154 I mean, my face, and my waist,<br />and my waist and...
713196 714280 My waist?
714906 717910 Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
722957 727461 Oh, I must've gotten up so<br />quickly my back is killing me.
728378 730213 You mean your head, right?
730755 734176 - Do you need help?<br />- No, I'm fine.
737763 741976 Is that really what I look like?<br />In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?
742143 743811 You're beautiful, miss.
743936 745522 Like an angel!
745689 746690 Really?
747816 748984 Could it be?
749192 751111 Excuse me, but who are you?
751152 752654 Oh... I'm Snow...
752905 753781 Snot?
753865 755407 No no no no no no.
756867 758702 My name is...
759495 760872 R-Red Shoes.
762289 765167 Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.
765209 769798 Cool name, but, by any chance<br />would that be Princess Red Shoes?
769840 771591 Of course, she's a princess!
771633 774595 How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?
774637 776555 Obviously! Right, miss?
776639 779600 Obviously, I mean I am a princess.
780726 782103 Who are you guys?
782145 784230 I'm Merlin.
784313 786774 Part time hero, full time romantic.
787650 790904 And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,<br />Pino, Noki and Kio.
790945 794533 No way, your names are<br />the same as the F-Seven.
794658 797369 The Fearless Seven.<br />I'm looking for them.
797411 800205 Let me guess,<br />Merlin's your favourite?
801081 803208 No, not really.
803250 805420 No, that Merlin's not your type.
805503 808423 You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
808548 812093 Honestly, none of them are<br />really my type.
813845 814846 Oh.
814846 816765 Well. That's fine.
816932 820186 Because we're not them, we're<br />actually completely different people.
820227 824981 In no way are we the same guys, put under<br />a curse, and changed into different forms.
825023 828193 But only if someone looks at us,<br />It's very complicated.
828234 829235 Right. We're all clear.
830320 832990 So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
833282 834992 I need to find my father,
835117 836994 and I know that the F-Seven can help.
837661 841999 We know the F-Seven very well,<br />and their schedule is fully booked.
842166 845002 Leave it to me,<br />I'll find your father within the month.
845044 846629 I can do it in one week.
846671 848381 - Four days! - Three days!
848423 849716 - Two days! - One!
849800 850675 Oomph!
850717 852927 I already found your<br />father like, two weeks ago.
853011 854096 Really?
854179 857140 I just need a few days<br />to get him across state lines.
857182 859184 I seriously need to find my dad.
859226 863647 Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven<br />in over a year, right?
863773 867110 You're not going to find them now,<br />we're your best bet.
868486 871865 Wow. No-ones offered to<br />help me for such a long time.
872866 873992 You guys are awesome
874033 877371 Really? You think we are awesome?
877412 882709 Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...
882751 885588 And not completely hideous to look at?
885755 888966 No, you guys are totally adorable.
889008 890886 I think I hit her too hard.
890927 893805 But she is beautiful.
894973 897433 She can help me break the curse.
902439 905693 Who is coming to my birthday party?
905777 907654 Has Ariel RSVP'd?
907695 910364 She says she can't make it, sir.<br />She has to wax her legs.
910406 911699 But she's a mermaid!
911783 912910 What about Sleeping Beauty?
912951 914161 Doctor's appointment.
914202 916329 - Is she sick?<br />- Says she has insomnia.
916371 918623 If she's not gonna sleep,<br />she can come to our party.
918665 919667 What about Rapunzel?
919708 922836 And don't tell me she's<br />getting her hair done.
922878 926089 Nope. It's something called, uh, book.
926173 927133 Princess Cruise?
927175 928301 That's a ship, sir.
928342 929010 Princess Leia?
929052 930218 She's a general!
930218 932970 I demand glorious guests!
933180 936434 How can I be any more unpopular!
936475 939144 And I don't understand, why?
941648 944442 Greetings, Prince Average.
944483 947028 It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.
947153 948529 Sure it is.
948822 952409 If you're here for the 'We Love<br />Our Peasants' group giveaway,
952451 955328 that motion is ended.<br />Grab your wrinkles and go.
955495 956496 Move along.
960750 964339 Do you think that people would respect you,
964380 971262 if you celebrated your birthday with<br />a beautiful woman on your arm?
971555 974725 Finally, someone talking sense!
974766 976601 This horrible crone gets it!
976642 979313 May I suggest inviting
979688 981898 this young lady?
982983 985737 She's beautiful, when can she get here?
985778 987614 Well, that's up to you.
987739 991325 You see, she's stolen something from me.
991533 997415 You find her, bring her along with you,<br />and you won't look like such a loser,
997582 1000711 and I get my shoes back.
1000878 1002880 Fear not, loyal hag.
1002921 1005048 I, Prince Average,
1005173 1009053 shall find this fugitive,<br />and make her pay for her crimes,
1009178 1011222 by making her attend my birthday party.
1012348 1014768 There shall be balloons!
1014851 1018229 I just thought of it.<br />Let's have a lot of balloons!
1018563 1020439 What a buffoon.
1029033 1030993 It looks just like papa.
1036832 1038417 Papa won't recognise me.
1044340 1048761 Why won't... why won't these<br />shoes just come off?
1055393 1058105 Yes, this is me.
1066406 1070076 Would you like to join me<br />in a moisturising mask?
1070242 1073205 Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...
1074122 1075123 Oh!
1075123 1076166 So tired.
1076208 1077500 Are you sure?
1077667 1080463 It's very important to take<br />care of your skin.
1080504 1081505 Positive.
1083632 1087011 But this is the finest French<br />recipe meant to hydrate skin.
1087428 1089722 It is made of French poopee!
1091057 1092058 Papa?
1093226 1097564 Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.
1097856 1099315 Oh, there it is.
1099649 1101944 Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?
1101986 1104196 Have you checked in the kitchen?
1104363 1107741 Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!
1110245 1112162 Now, where was I?
1112955 1115207 Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?
1116793 1118169 - It's nowhere to be... - No!
1118211 1121381 Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.<br />Now please, go away.
1121422 1123509 Someone's got anger management issues.
1127596 1130182 Getting a kiss was never<br />a problem with this face.
1133019 1134020 Red Shoes?
1136062 1137398 Papa?
1138065 1139816 Papa? Are you there?
1140734 1141777 Papa?
1164718 1169015 Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are<br />the way to a woman's heart.
1171350 1174521 It works! I call it, an auto portrait.
1174563 1176189 I call it, the duplicatertron.
1176230 1177691 I call it, selfie!
1177732 1179400 Red Shoes must love it!
1179442 1180903 Monsieur, monsieur.
1180945 1183613 She doesn't want sweets and selfies.
1183781 1186116 Women want diamonds.
1186366 1187367 Merlin?
1193624 1197420 The Book of Spells To Make You Fall In Love?
1201549 1205221 Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.
1205262 1206722 You're a nice bunny.
1207514 1209725 You're a Vegan bunny, right?
1213312 1215689 What was that? Lightning?
1215815 1218318 Actually, it's called magic. I do it.
1218360 1220612 Really? Then do some!
1221654 1223365 ♪ Darling...
1224783 1228411 ♪ Wish you could see what can I see
1228954 1232708 ♪ Miles ahead just you and me
1233084 1236087 ♪ To infinity
1241341 1244177 Keep running, and whatever<br />you do, don't look back.
1244219 1245512 But I can't leave without you.
1245763 1248016 You're looking back. Don't do that.
1248224 1249225 But...
1249976 1251852 Hate to zap you longears,
1252060 1254523 But I need to impress a beautiful woman.
1254689 1256858 Big, scary bunny! Over here!
1256900 1258902 Red! Stop putting yourself in...
1261113 1262782 ...danger...
1282553 1284263 Arthur! I got you.
1284513 1286973 It's no use, Red Shoes.
1287015 1290687 I'm slippin' away. Not much time...
1290728 1293856 Just... need to... use that core of mine...
1293898 1296400 I see the light at the end of the funnel.
1296650 1300113 Time for me to kick the bucket
1300155 1302156 I had a good run. I was God blessed.
1302198 1306203 Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!
1306411 1309581 Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
1309622 1312668 Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.
1312919 1315629 Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.
1315671 1317923 And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.
1317965 1320218 No, No, No. I'm fine, but Arthur, he's stuck.
1320259 1321720 He tried to save me and...
1321761 1323221 Would you get up?
1323638 1325264 What? He's not hurt?
1325431 1327852 - Only his pride.<br />- Seriously Arthur?
1327977 1330395 You need to find a better<br />way to hit on girls.
1339739 1342616 Stand back! I may have to risk my life.
1351917 1353794 Someone call for three inventors?
1353961 1355421 For three geniuses?
1356006 1357507 That sounds like us!
1358758 1362220 Everyone came runnin' to help,<br />great, just great.
1362262 1363972 Everyone except Merlin, that is.
1364014 1366224 Ah! Super, there he is now.
1366850 1367726 Where have you been?
1367768 1370522 Something awful could've happened<br />to Red if I hadn't shown up.
1370563 1371648 You?
1372398 1374608 Don't even go there!
1374984 1377154 I saved her first.
1378280 1380198 - Right?<br />- I was worried about you.
1380323 1382242 I was worried about me too.
1382575 1385412 - But mostly you.<br />- No-one needs to worry.
1385454 1387706 Arthur's here. Please, my lady.
1387831 1389124 Um... Okay.
1398384 1400470 You shouldn't go into the<br />forest by yourself.
1400679 1405725 It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for<br />bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
1406143 1407269 ...And squirrels.
1407436 1409146 I thought I saw my father.
1409813 1412566 Turned out, just to be that big bunny.
1412732 1416737 Well, if you ever make such a dangerous<br />and weird mistake again,
1416904 1419073 just know that I can protect you.
1419573 1420867 This's very kind.
1420909 1425538 And if you really want to express<br />your gratitude, you can...
1427332 1429793 Oh, I am so sorry.
1429835 1435132 This was much slappier than<br />I intended it to be.
1435507 1437927 Oh! It happens. No problem.
1438635 1440887 Maybe an apology kiss then?
1443516 1444934 Bravo mon ami!
1445435 1446810 Nice try.
1447478 1449020 Red Shoes.
1453776 1457239 Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going<br />to have to work as a tightly knit team.
1457364 1459282 Which means, you do everything I say.
1459366 1460908 - Excuse? - Huh? - What? - No.
1460950 1461701 You got to be kidding.
1461743 1463996 Hans and Jack will search around the Dismal Lake.
1464079 1466957 Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.
1467082 1470127 Red Shoe and I, will go to Golden Goose Avenue.
1470252 1474923 Golden Goose Avenue, which happens<br />to be your go to place for dates.
1475048 1477260 We are going to focus on the mission.
1477426 1479721 And then see where the evening takes us.
1480013 1484183 The only thing you're going to shop for<br />on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.
1484225 1485895 And you can't even afford that.
1486061 1488647 I like my odds. You saw what she did.
1488688 1491024 An expression of affection.
1491191 1493027 Every woman shows it differently.
1493152 1494654 You took your shot. You got slapped.
1494695 1495738 May I remind you
1495780 1499659 that this is the closest thing to a<br />kiss anyone's had since the curse.
1500744 1504330 Let's work together to guide<br />Red Shoes' feelings towards me
1504372 1506207 so we can break the curse.
1506249 1507543 What about the rest of us?
1507584 1510086 After I resume my princely form,
1510253 1512714 the word about F-Seven will be out.
1512756 1516510 Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.
1516593 1518387 - Really?<br />- Sounds reasonable.
1518470 1519972 I'll bring the gelato!
1520014 1522600 Getting one kiss sure is easier<br />than getting seven.
1522684 1525562 This is not a plan,<br />he's just out for himself!
1525603 1527605 A half baked plan is better than none.
1527647 1531234 Don't worry Merlin,<br />I have a big assignment for you.
1531902 1533486 Big assignment?
1533821 1535989 Here you go. I drew these up last night.
1536364 1539743 I can't tell if this drawing is terrible, or
1540369 1542079 really avant garde.
1542204 1544415 Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.
1544583 1545959 Pablo Picassover?
1546000 1549795 One thing's for sure,<br />daddy's on the big side...
1550378 1551965 ...of big.
1553132 1554550 You must take after your mother.
1554758 1556009 No, I look a lot like papa... Oh!
1557010 1563267 Yeah, my mother. Gosh! We... exactly! Twins!
1564102 1566939 Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.
1566981 1569774 Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!
1572236 1573738 And where d'ya think you're going?
1574071 1575781 Your post is right there.
1575865 1578450 You'll watch the savage monster.<br />I call him Vicious!
1578492 1580035 I call him Woodbottom.
1580120 1582538 Do not worry Merlin. We'll make<br />sure you get kissed too.
1582788 1583999 Eventually.
1585583 1586792 We'll split up here.
1586834 1588587 Alright, see you later.
1589463 1592423 I know exactly where we should<br />look to find your father.
1592674 1594175 Really? Where?
1602227 1603353 Daddy!
1603645 1604646 Wow!
1605647 1606814 Is this what I think it is?
1606856 1612905 I present Excalibur, the legendary<br />sword trapped in this rock for centuries.
1613280 1616659 Waiting for a man of great<br />strength to release it.
1616700 1619953 It says 'Do not attempt to remove by force'.
1620037 1622540 ...Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.
1622873 1628963 The truth is, I realized you were the woman<br />of my destiny the first time I saw you.
1629297 1632009 I thought if I could show you my strength
1632259 1634469 I would be worthy of your affections.
1638391 1639391 Oh!
1639892 1641852 Oops, I'll put it back.
1641894 1643562 No No No! Can I have it?
1653948 1657117 Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.
1657451 1659704 You want me to, maybe pull<br />it out for you again?
1659954 1662207 No, I'm not humiliated at all.
1662999 1664042 Let's go.
1673635 1677389 Don't look at me like that,<br />I'm the real prisoner here.
1677639 1679725 What? You hungry?
1681185 1682770 And fetch!
1690738 1692489 Hop along, big guy!
1692697 1695450 There's no way Arthur is<br />breaking this curse alone!
1712427 1713512 Woah!
1715264 1717056 Arthur, where're you going?
1720310 1721311 Okay.

1734743 1735744 Woah!

2417553 2418554 Do it. Do it!
2420598 2423309 Now, here's the good news.<br />It's my birthday!
2423476 2426938 And you are going to be<br />the belle of the ball.
2426980 2430734 The invitation sounds great,<br />really. But...
2430817 2433069 It wasn't an invitation,<br />more of an order.
2433194 2434154 Prepare the lady's carriage.
2434195 2436741 She said she doesn't want to go, Average.
2436783 2439702 Avv-vous-rarge!
2439827 2441453 Don't troll me, Troll.
2441829 2442955 Ah! So rude.
2442997 2445250 I couldn't agree more.<br />Subjects these days.
2445292 2446418 Now. Shall we?
2455010 2456011 Get her!
2456261 2457930 You hold off the guards, and<br />I'll get her out of here.
2457971 2461017 No, I'm faster. You stay<br />here and buy us time.
2469358 2470151 Here's a thought.
2470359 2472528 Stop fighting and fight!
2474073 2475115 What's the plan?
2476158 2477617 Rescue Red Shoes.
2477659 2479577 Like the old days, guys.
2514573 2515574 Arthur!
2521580 2523750 Can we get this over with?<br />They're just dwarfs!
2536054 2538516 Did you guys hear something?
2547567 2548568 Come on!
2568965 2569966 Duck!
2576139 2578434 Hi, guards, are we taking a break?
2578517 2579643 ...well, FYI
2579685 2581937 They're getting away!
2588818 2589945 No!
2595951 2598287 Who's throwin' vegetables?
2602833 2605712 Yeah! You just got Merlined!
2613887 2614888 Run!
2616306 2617307 Jack!
2628027 2629028 Duck!
2633951 2635702 I'm so sorry. You alright?
2635827 2638079 No. I'm not.
2643794 2646797 Gentlemen, he surrenders.
2647006 2648008 What?
2678040 2679457 Engines. Full power.
2679541 2680542 Shields up.
2681501 2683045 Turn on the mini frizzer.
2701814 2703316 Superhero landing!
2703482 2704442 Hooray for us!
2704483 2706861 - We did it!<br />- It was mostly me.
2706903 2707904 Yeah!
2708404 2709405 What?
2712868 2714119 You've got to be kidding.
2714203 2716705 Finally the big guns, thank you.
2716955 2717956 Fire!
2726256 2727258 Fire!
2733181 2734725 Ooh, close.
2735058 2736852 The cannonball. Not you.
2737561 2739896 Timeout, timeout.<br />Everyone, timeout.
2740271 2743567 You almost blew her up, and she can't<br />come to my party if you blow her up.
2743609 2744735 Sorry, sir.
2745111 2746570 Alright. Time back in.
2747571 2748781 Surrender monsters!
2748823 2749991 No! Wait!
2782526 2783860 Oh. That's pretty cool.
2791742 2793662 Everyone inside. And hurry!
2807635 2810055 You messed with the wrong prince.
2810221 2812890 There is nothing average about Avv-vous-rarge.
2813098 2816353 I shall return!
2816562 2817479 On Tuesday.
2817521 2819856 No, wait. I'll check my calendar...
2819898 2823986 Thursday, I shall return Thursday!
2825362 2826613 We'll be ready.
2826655 2827448 And waiting.
2827531 2828490 Arrivederci!
2828532 2829534 Ciao for now!
2829617 2830368 Bye bye!
2830493 2832119 You just got dwarfed!
2832244 2834288 Is that better? I think Merlined is better.
2850515 2855061 You should have seen the look on his big<br />ugly face when bunny came running at him.
2856104 2858273 That's how you see everything, isn't it?
2858315 2859608 With my eyes?
2859816 2862694 You always talk about<br />what someone looks like.
2862777 2865280 I do? I wouldn't say that.
2865322 2867908 But I can't wait for you<br />to see the real me.
2868200 2870077 What kind of Merlin is the real you?
2870285 2871703 You might not believe it,
2871786 2875333 but the real me is famous,<br />handsome, and even popular.
2875500 2878461 Not short, stumpy and green.
2878586 2881882 Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but
2881923 2884843 you're also a wonderful and charming person.
2884885 2886386 I'm not explaining it right.
2886469 2890057 If you saw the real me,<br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
2890890 2892850 I think I can see the real you.
2893476 2896688 And I like you, just as you are.
2898565 2899858 That's hilarious.
2900150 2903988 Here, close your eyes,<br />and imagine the real me.
2904488 2906990 I guarantee you, it'll be different.
2908660 2912288 I do feel something different ..
2912497 2913498 Really?
2913706 2915918 But eyes opened or closed
2916001 2918253 to me you're still Merlin.
2919629 2924177 Now tell me, who am I to you?
2924760 2926304 You're a gift.
2926429 2930642 A gift that'll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
2931350 2933436 Just like you're amazing.
2941695 2944740 Actually, I want to show you something too.
2949328 2950745 You need a hand?
2950871 2954250 Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.
2954875 2956419 ...One...
2956461 2958212 Two, yeah, okay, I need help.
2976524 2978025 Woah. Woah woah woah.
2978025 2979819 No thank you.
2985908 2989079 You know what the weird thing is?<br />They're super comfortable.
2991332 2994667 Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were<br />you when the facade was falling?
2994709 2996837 I mean, that was terrifying.
2998671 2999756 What're you doing here?
3001758 3003677 I have come for my shoes.
3003969 3008348 Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.<br />But those dwarfs!
3008348 3010894 It's dwarves with a 'v'.<br />So you failed?
3011603 3015606 I did not fail, I took a timeout.
3015689 3017692 Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.
3017734 3019861 I'm going to return on Thursday,<br />we all pencilled it in.
3019986 3020987 Silence!
3021280 3022781 Have a bite.
3023323 3024784 For strength.
3025450 3029621 Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.
3029663 3032333 I don't have much time, Prince.
3032625 3036629 You could still have the<br />best birthday ever,
3036796 3038256 But remember...
3038298 3044930 What's bad for me,<br />will be very bad for you.
3051019 3052020 She's gone.
3053230 3055525 Ah! What's the worst that could happen.
3059570 3060571 It's kind of sweet.
3076840 3077841 Don't move.
3077966 3078507 Okay.
3078549 3080634 Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.
3080676 3081594 Okey doky!
3081635 3082428 Here we go!
3082470 3083597 Our pleasure.
3090855 3093357 ...here we go, yeah, a little
3093357 3094524 Oooh a little over here!
3111250 3113044 Now that looks like a real home.
3113086 3115045 Yep. I could get used to that.
3115255 3116464 Uh uh. I cannot.
3120135 3123138 It's a perfect copy of my drawing.<br />That's incredible.
3124472 3125723 Let me try.
3126893 3129228 This will definitely make it easier to<br />find your dad.
3129311 3131605 Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.
3131647 3132481 It's grounded.
3132523 3133525 Why does it need to fly?
3133566 3136318 The posters are no good if we<br />can't distribute them fast.
3136569 3140489 Guys, thank you so much for<br />everything you're doing.
3140991 3142993 - My pleasure.<br />- It's nice.
3212566 3213610 Opening doors!
3229668 3232880 You know Merlin, I feel so<br />lucky that I've met you.
3233589 3235466 I feel the same way.
3235884 3239220 I feel like anything is possible.
3240554 3242014 ♪ Darling
3243725 3247562 ♪ Come on out there and take my hand
3247896 3251692 ♪ I will show you that I'm your man
3251776 3254694 ♪ Is that okay
3255487 3257615 Merlin! Watch out!
3268626 3270045 Merlin.
3271880 3272923 Merlin.
3274216 3275217 Merlin!
3275634 3277135 Everything okay?
3277553 3278763 Of course! Sure!
3279556 3280807 Nothing to be embarrassed about.
3280848 3285061 So why are we even talking about<br />that when we should be going...
3285102 3286104 this direction.
3286271 3287272 Hey wait!
3290983 3293904 So, about these magic shoes.
3294071 3295280 Why, are they still bothering you?
3295322 3297324 What kind of magic do<br />those shoes have?
3297700 3300703 Well .. How do I put this.
3300912 3304664 Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.
3305082 3307292 And, I was always proud of that.
3307334 3312380 But, the shoes magic, umm,<br />it made me a little dainty?
3312506 3313549 Sorry to hear.
3313591 3317887 The shoes made me lose<br />a little bit of weight.
3318096 3319305 It could be worse.
3319347 3320681 ...Okay.
3321682 3323268 - A lot of weight.<br />- Ah.
3324353 3328481 Well, I know what it's like to look different on<br />the outside from what you feel on the inside.
3333153 3337200 Merlin, I'd like to give you a<br />token of my appreciation.
3338618 3340620 Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.
3340828 3341329 Why?
3341371 3343999 Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.
3345208 3346209 Give me a second.
3358640 3362518 There. Consider it your good luck charm.
3365981 3367065 Thank you.
3373614 3377409 Merlin, do you think we'd be happier
3377701 3379912 if we were our old selves again?
3380078 3382831 Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.
3382999 3384250 I don't know.
3385376 3386960 I like how we are.
3387712 3391090 Right here, just, right now.
3391758 3395470 Even if I'm an ugly green monster?
3396972 3400559 I don't care about your height<br />or what colour you are.
3401476 3405022 And that's the way you feel about me, right?
3405147 3408274 Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!
3409944 3413738 I think we're both just trapped<br />under the same spell.
3430006 3436137 Wait. Keep your eyes closed<br />and don't open them until I say.
3436305 3438391 When you open your eyes there will be...
3438600 3441268 a handsome man in front of you.
3441310 3442770 Someone worthy of you.
3442812 3445022 Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.
3446233 3447400 I think you're right.
3447484 3450027 Ready? And...
3450362 3453532 Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!
3456034 3457035 Now!
3457494 3458662 Ta-da!
3458829 3461832 You just got Merlined!
3462041 3463209 What do you think?
3463626 3466879 Mission impossibly handsome, right?
3468632 3472010 Oh, it's okay,<br />I know this is a lot to take in.
3472343 3474889 But you can let your happiness flag fly.
3474930 3478850 This, this is the real me.
3479768 3481854 - It's stupid.<br />- What?
3483022 3484231 Wait a minute!
3484690 3487234 My hands are still green sausages.
3488360 3490530 No! I look the same.
3490781 3493324 Yes, impossibly handsome.
3493366 3495535 This doesn't make sense.
3495660 3498664 You're the most beautiful woman in<br />the world, why do I look the same?
3498872 3500791 What're you talking about, Merlin?
3500832 3502250 Do I need a longer kiss?
3502709 3503711 Two kisses?
3504587 3506172 Let's try again.
3506714 3507714 Umm.
3507714 3509133 You're not making any sense.
3518392 3519393 Hurry!
3521353 3522354 What is that?
3522646 3525232 This kingdom has a serious<br />monster problem.
3541125 3541667 Are you alright?
3541709 3543627 No. I'm not.
3552136 3552762 Thank you.
3552804 3554055 Pleasure, milady.
3556391 3557392 Watch out!
3575036 3577080 Ha-hah! Yes!
3583169 3585631 What do they want,<br />besides smashing us?
3585673 3586673 I don't know!
3595683 3597226 The old me would've nailed that.
3605736 3607113 You just got Merlined!
3618081 3619082 Hurry!
3634474 3635935 Red, close your eyes.
3635976 3637811 This is no time for kissing, Merlin.
3637852 3639979 Trust me. Close your eyes.
3641190 3642858 Please, close them!
3647530 3648949 That was too close.
3649741 3651159 Don't look at me.
3651326 3653328 You see that tree on the<br />other side of the bridge?
3653369 3653954 Yeah.
3653995 3656998 On my signal, run towards<br />it as fast as you can.
3657040 3658542 No, I can't leave you here.
3658709 3661920 You have to.<br />And don't look back, okay?
3662087 3664465 Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.
3664590 3666175 Promise you won't look.
3666217 3668677 Okay. I promise.
3669261 3670262 Now!
3701755 3702756 What?
3702797 3705091 You just got Merlined?<br />Oh. Yes you did.
3734122 3735831 Hey! Locate!
3736875 3738627 Hey, locate here!
3738919 3741963 You're even more of a blockhead<br />than Prince Average.
3744175 3746635 Avv-vous-rarge!
3746928 3748387 Prince Average?
3764654 3766240 You just got Merlined.
3769827 3771161 Take a look, Red Shoes.
3771495 3772037 Merlin!
3772079 3774541 I have triumphantly saved the day.
3775709 3776710 Merlin, no!
3779128 3780422 Merlin!
3785260 3786553 Merlin!
3851372 3852874 Snow White?
3862384 3864052 Snow White?
3864386 3867264 The thief was Snow White<br />this whole time?
3867348 3870851 Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
3872644 3875106 You're going after her yourself?
3875190 3876732 What? Were you going to go?
3877442 3879944 I get it! I don't have legs.
3882531 3885909 So, here I am.
3886993 3888161 All the real me.
3889789 3891207 I bet you're disappointed, huh?
3891415 3894460 You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.
3894501 3895043 Red Shoes!
3895086 3898423 That's not my name, it's Snow White.
3898548 3901050 Princess Snow White? So your father is...
3901092 3903511 King White, yeah.
3903846 3907390 By the time I figured out his<br />new wife Regina was a witch
3908433 3910269 he'd already disappeared.
3910811 3913314 And the monsters who attacked us
3913356 3917360 were sent by my stepmother<br />to get these shoes.
3918653 3921614 I guess being beautiful is really<br />worth that much to her.
3921948 3924867 Have you thought about<br />just giving them back?
3925868 3927495 And give up their magic?
3928704 3932291 If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't<br />have helped me find my father, would you?
3933251 3934586 Would you?
3938381 3940842 I thought we were both<br />under the same spell.
3942094 3945389 But I see now that I was wrong.
3945805 3951311 Listen, I can't get into all the details,<br />but I'm under a curse too.
3951729 3953648 You still don't get it, Merlin.
3954858 3957360 I'm not talking about our curses.
3958069 3960863 Merlin, I'm talking about<br />the kind of spell
3962073 3964159 you never want to break.
4012878 4015380 He likes you more than he likes me.
4047288 4050626 What would've happened if she'd taken<br />off her shoes that day in the barn?
4050667 4052086 You think that's important?
4054671 4056424 I just wonder,
4056424 4059427 what I would've done if I'd<br />seen the real Snow White.
4059677 4061053 Seriously?
4061137 4063431 It's still all about appearance for you.

4067352 4070189 But I can't live looking like<br />you for the rest of my life
4070356 4074652 Kind of proving my point, other me.<br />Alright. Let's try this.
4075152 4077822 Who do you like more,<br />Snow White or Red Shoes?
4077989 4079908 Easy, it's Red Shoes.
4080074 4082743 Now, which of us do you<br />think Red Shoes likes more?
4082826 4084538 Easy, it's me!
4086456 4089083 Wait. No.
4089668 4090835 It's...

4187689 4189399 I thought you left.
4189608 4191151 You should take them off again.
4196448 4197449 I can't.
4198242 4201203 You just had to make things complicated.
4202246 4203623 Maybe this will help.
4203831 4206167 Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.
4206208 4207334 Where did you get that?
4207626 4209922 I want to help you, Snow White.
4210172 4211173 Please.
4217846 4218847 Red Shoes?
4219431 4220432 Merlin?
4221349 4222351 Merlin?
4225188 4227648 What terrible timing you have.
4230652 4232653 We're gonna have to do this the hard way.
4233362 4234362 Regina?
4237784 4240744 Such a tender family reunion.
4241079 4243206 So sad we can't stay!
4244041 4245125 Red Shoes!
4247586 4249504 Come on, let's go, longears.
4249546 4251089 Hey! Wait for us!
4251130 4253175 How 'bout you go back<br />and get the others?
4253342 4255302 And make lots of copies of this.
4255886 4256887 Let's go!
4259390 4260725 We can do this.
4260766 4261767 Yeah!
4264186 4266648 Your power my lady. It has drained you.
4266732 4270610 You think? I don't need<br />you to tell me how I look.
4270777 4272988 I'm a mirror. It's what I do.
4273030 4275907 M - I - R - O - R.<br />I can't spell.
4275949 4276950 Enough.
4278118 4279370 Bind her.
4280413 4282540 It's snack time.
4286168 4288380 How can you sleep at<br />a time like this?
4290048 4292717 I'm not supposed to talk<br />when I have this on,
4292759 4296179 but I got to ask.<br />Do you think they've kissed yet?
4296263 4297264 I hope so,
4297348 4300308 because it'll feel better to<br />punch Merlin when he's pretty.
4301518 4304688 We've been waiting for a...<br />Where have you been?
4304730 4305731 Did you break the curse yet?
4305773 4307441 Merlin, are you hungry?
4307650 4308776 Those are bears.
4308817 4309819 Ah...
4309819 4312697 Hi? This is from Merlin.
4331092 4333053 Wow! This is so cool.
4336931 4338307 Okay, sword.
4338474 4343271 If you think you've humiliated, embarrassed,<br />and otherwise frustrated me,
4343771 4344939 you're right.
4345440 4349110 But that ends now!
4358704 4360748 Oh, zut alors. Please end this.
4372385 4376474 Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.
4376515 4377850 The castle's over there.
4394784 4395785 Sit.
4407423 4411261 Eat this darling, and you'll<br />get your freedom.
4411427 4412763 Where is my father?
4413429 4417433 Royal loyal little girl,<br />pining for her papa?
4417850 4422147 This is getting a little boring, so I need<br />you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.
4422273 4423690 I won't let you win.
4424107 4427570 You've torn apart my family,<br />and you will not get away with it, Regina.
4428613 4431448 Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.
4431740 4434702 Very well. A different approach.
4443377 4444378 - Merlin!<br />- No!
4444837 4447382 Eat the apple, or watch him die.
4447549 4448425 That's your choice.
4448466 4450343 Don't do it. No!
4450385 4452262 No!
4453721 4454723 Red Shoes!
4454723 4456975 Promise to me, you'll let him go.
4457142 4460437 Oh absolutely.<br />When the third bell chimes,
4460646 4463566 everything will be just<br />like it used to be.
4463691 4465985 No! No no no.
4468196 4469989 Save my papa for me.
4480459 4481961 Red Shoes!
4496767 4501398 A legendary handsome knight,<br />fearless rescuer of princesses.
4501523 4506613 Sitting in a tree,<br />not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.
4507780 4509448 Burn. I can't spell.
4511783 4513245 You don't have to do this.
4513286 4515372 Just take the shoes and let us go.
4515830 4518583 I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.
4518708 4521712 The fruit of temptation and want.<br />They feed on your desires
4521754 4526216 Once they give you what you desire,<br />the bond is permanent.
4526424 4528677 That's not true. She took<br />them off in the river.
4528761 4530429 That doesn't make any sense.
4530471 4535101 How could she possibly want to save you<br />more than she wanted to be beautiful?
4535352 4537437 What did you do to her?
4537687 4539606 Did you cast a spell?
4541734 4543276 What's going to happen to her?
4543317 4548239 Well, once she eats the apple, its magic<br />will turn her into a magic apple tree.
4548281 4551368 The first bell, nothing really happens,<br />but very dramatic.
4551576 4553870 The tree bears fruit,<br />and the second bell...
4553912 4556123 Oh! Excitement mounts!
4556373 4558333 The morning sun touches the fruit
4558458 4561045 turning it into a new<br />pair of red shoes
4561086 4564048 And number three, the circle of life!
4564424 4565425 And then what?
4565550 4569053 Regina will be the most<br />beautiful person in the kingdom.
4569429 4570345 Forever.
4570387 4573266 I don't care about her,<br />what about Snow White?
4573433 4577645 The tree withers and dies,<br />and so does Snow White.
4577687 4579481 No!
4579606 4581317 Yes!
4582108 4585863 Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.
4602756 4605592 Why don't you come back and play?
4611932 4613309 Not so fast.
4623070 4624196 It's gonna hurt.
4627866 4630911 Oh yeah! Stretch it out.
4642507 4643717 Uh-oh.
4648012 4649179 Smoke! Smoke!
4649388 4651349 We're here, bitch. Are you okay?
4651391 4652851 Yeah.
4653434 4655436 I never thought I'd say this,
4656146 4658440 but I'm so glad to be chubby<br />and green again.
4659233 4662444 Seven to one.<br />I like those odds.
4662653 4663695 Let's go.
4665657 4667659 We like those odds even better.
4670494 4672247 Are you up to this, muchacho?
4673415 4675792 You finally pulled out Excalibur.
4675917 4680047 Oh, yes, yes. I did it.<br />That's exactly how it went down.
4680088 4682340 Here you go Merlin.<br />You're gonna need these.
4682382 4683383 Thanks.
4689098 4691392 Here comes the sun.
4691850 4693686 Now let's all get dwarfed.
4697607 4702112 Ah, this is where your<br />fairy tale ends, trolls.
4706741 4707742 You missed.
4744616 4746368 Au revoir, mirror!
4761466 4762718 Finally.
4771394 4774105 It's a good day to break a curse.
4775774 4777984 Eternal Beauty.
4791206 4792207 I'm sorry
4792750 4794084 Snow White.
4797172 4800383 Ahhh!
4827412 4830123 Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.
4836505 4837465 Woah! We're back!
4837506 4838549 Yippee!
4848977 4849978 Papa?
4860113 4861490 Snow White?
4863783 4864868 Oh papa!
4864994 4865994 Snow!
4871250 4872251 Wait.
4872417 4873669 Where's Merlin?
4873794 4875462 I'm so sorry.
4875922 4879884 He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
4880343 4882011 Merlin, no!
4885056 4886600 Merlin!
4947122 4948750 I thought you were gone.
4949585 4953880 You're the most beautiful<br />woman in the world.
4955716 4958218 With my eyes open
4959970 4961429 or closed.
4972733 4973734 No.
4991128 4992963 I got Merlined.
5018157 5019784 You're a prince, Merlin.
5027375 5030045 Yeah, that Merlin.
5030462 5033464 The one who's not really your type.
5037219 5039805 I kind of liked the short<br />and green Merlin.
5042224 5044769 But I'm still that Merlin inside.
5045853 5048480 Yes, yes you are.
