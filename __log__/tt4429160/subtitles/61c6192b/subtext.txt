24600 27728 This, is Fairy Tale Island.
28061 31315 A magical land of princes and princesses
31816 33526 witches and monsters.
34443 38865 Accidents and strange events<br />happen all the time.
39033 41410 And that's when people call us.
41785 46499 The Fearless Seven, the greatest<br />heroes on Fairy Tale Island.
46541 48834 Especially me, Merlin.
49543 53464 But everything changed<br />the day we defeated a dragon
53673 55383 and saved a Princess.
57051 61181 We thought we'd saved a witch,<br />so, we attacked her.
61640 64392 But we were wrong.
64811 68355 She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.
68397 70732 The Fairy Princess!
71067 73653 How were we supposed to know?<br />She looks like a witch,
73653 76780 and everyone knows that a<br />princess doesn't look like a witch.
77823 82369 Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,<br />so she put a curse on us.
82578 84538 And this was a nasty one.
84705 89126 That turned us into little ugly green<br />monsters whenever people looked at us.
89544 91421 And the only way to break the curse
91463 95467 is to get a kiss from the<br />most beautiful woman in the world.
96009 97803 Are you kidding me?
97886 99554 With this face?
146814 148399 Hello, your majesty.
148524 151277 - Good morning ma'am.<br />- Good morning ma'am.
155197 159161 Magic tree, magic tree...
159411 165250 Let this morning be the time<br />that you perform your duty,
170548 178556 of bringing me the shoes<br />of youthful eternal... beauty.
186814 187815 Yes!
189108 190819 Change me!
193196 194655 Finally!
199578 201705 Not again! How long must I wait?
201830 203541 - No. - Clear these away.
203541 204542 Uh-oh.
204333 205125 Heads off.
205292 206877 Pull yourself together.
210673 211716 Here you are.
212550 214677 Oh? Thanks!
238119 241373 That wasn't here before.<br />What is she up to now?
261186 262187 Huh?
282917 283918 Huh?
287755 289256 You weren't here before.
293886 294887 Whatever.
299518 300852 Oh! Oww!
305024 306025 Yes!
309153 313575 I can't believe my beloved daughter<br />Snow White has turned eighteen.
313741 319456 I only wish her mother could see the kind of<br />smart and beautiful young woman she's become.
320040 322918 Strange thing happened during the party.
323126 326839 The castle guards brought in<br />a woman named Regina.
327047 332845 They said she was a witch,<br />but she was too beautiful to be a witch.
332928 337391 I have married Regina.<br />Everything feels so perfect!
337976 344399 Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.<br />There's something not quite right.
345024 349279 People around the castle have been<br />disappearing, one by one.
349446 352074 Is it because of that peculiar mirror?
352157 357122 I saw it with my own eyes,<br />Regina talking to a tree.
357163 359499 She must be a witch!
359999 363837 I should send Snow away to a safer place.
363879 369092 My dear Snow, by the time you read this,<br />my fate will be uncertain.
369426 371262 She's coming for me now.
371387 376057 I only hope you can find the<br />Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.
377727 378811 Apples...
378895 381939 ...the most suspicious of fruits.
383565 384567 Oh,
384567 387653 Papa, where are you?
391366 392950 But they don't look dangerous.
410135 410761 Regina?
410803 413973 No, my shoes! Get her!
423317 424651 - Can I borrow this?<br />- Okay.
424693 425694 Thanks!
440125 441294 What?
442588 444965 Nooo!
452514 455100 Short, chubby, and green.
456352 457979 Green is like an ogre.
458020 461232 Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.<br />And cuddly.
461566 464111 Quit your complaining, Merlin!
464236 467948 I'm figuring out how to take this curse<br />and kick it where the sun don't shine.
468156 472578 Listen, we need to find the most<br />beautifullest princess to kiss us,
472703 474622 and we've just about run out of options.
475122 479668 How would a beautiful woman<br />even see you, Mister Invisible?
482505 484673 - What was that?<br />- Some kind of bird?
489428 492347 Magic mirror, full of wisdom,
492472 495518 who's the fairest in the Kingdom?
495852 498771 The woman who wears the red shoes.
500857 503735 And side note, wisdom and<br />kingdom don't really rhyme.
503777 507532 Cut the sass and tell me her name!
508533 510409 How should I know?<br />I don't get out much.
510492 512744 Well, you are the magic mirror.
512912 517417 Magic is just my first name,<br />it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.
517458 519877 What can you do then?
520044 524465 I just reflect what I see,<br />the truth. The truth is,
524550 529388 that you should see yourself right now.<br />Right now!
530806 531890 Watch it.
532516 537564 Distribute wanted posters to every town,<br />village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,
537689 539398 and find her!
541192 542902 I feel my power draining.
543027 546864 I don't have much time.<br />The aging is accelerating.
547157 550285 And only three bumbling<br />bits of kindling for help.
550410 554498 Perhaps you should recruit another, someone<br />who stands to gain from your success.
554540 556542 What about this fellow?
557375 559587 Interesting.
560088 564217 Tell me more, Magichard.
565259 567387 Hey hey, Over here! Over here!
567429 568930 See, see. Come! Very quick.
568972 570432 Look at this. Look, look, look.
571558 572559 What is it?
577106 579274 I know a lot about silhouettes,
579483 581652 and I think this shape is a witch.
581694 585114 Let's not jump to conclusions.<br />Yes, it could be a witch.
585197 586073 ...Or
586198 587074 Ya. It's a witch
587200 589160 The witch who cursed us?
589244 591246 Let's catch her and make<br />her break the spell!
610141 610557 En garde!
610599 612518 Wands where I can see 'em, witch!
621527 622528 Fraulein!
622528 623571 No No No! Stop!
623613 625908 I get you some revenge!
629786 630871 Beautiful!
631205 634041 I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.
634124 635668 How did she end up with us?
643092 646888 Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my<br />home slash command post.
646930 649558 I have six room mates<br />but my name's on the lease.
649599 651017 I pay the rent.
651225 655605 Your home? Oh my gosh,<br />I am... I am so sorry.
655773 657524 I was starving and...
657566 659568 No need to apologize.
659819 662447 We didn't mean to interrupt<br />your stolen meal.
662488 665658 If you're still hungry,<br />I can whip up something simple.
665700 667786 - You see I, marinate the solution and...
667828 668954 Who is that?
670288 671289 Uhh...
671289 672540 Who?
679340 682510 Wow. I look so different.
682844 685554 I mean, my face, and my waist,<br />and my waist and...
685596 686680 My waist?
687306 690310 Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
695357 699861 Oh, I must've gotten up so<br />quickly my back is killing me.
700778 702613 You mean your head, right?
703155 706576 - Do you need help?<br />- No, I'm fine.
710163 714376 Is that really what I look like?<br />In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?
714543 716211 You're beautiful, miss.
716336 717922 Like an angel!
718089 719090 Really?
720216 721384 Could it be?
721592 723511 Excuse me, but who are you?
723552 725054 Oh... I'm Snow...
725305 726181 Snot?
726265 727807 No no no no no no.
729267 731102 My name is...
731895 733272 R-Red Shoes.
734689 737567 Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.
737609 742198 Cool name, but, by any chance<br />would that be Princess Red Shoes?
742240 743991 Of course, she's a princess!
744033 746995 How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?
747037 748955 Obviously! Right, miss?
749039 752000 Obviously, I mean I am a princess.
753126 754503 Who are you guys?
754545 756630 I'm Merlin.
756713 759174 Part time hero, full time romantic.
760050 763304 And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,<br />Pino, Noki and Kio.
763345 766933 No way, your names are<br />the same as the F-Seven.
767058 769769 The Fearless Seven.<br />I'm looking for them.
769811 772605 Let me guess,<br />Merlin's your favourite?
773481 775608 No, not really.
775650 777820 No, that Merlin's not your type.
777903 780823 You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
780948 784493 Honestly, none of them are<br />really my type.
786245 787246 Oh.
787246 789165 Well. That's fine.
789332 792586 Because we're not them, we're<br />actually completely different people.
792627 797381 In no way are we the same guys, put under<br />a curse, and changed into different forms.
797423 800593 But only if someone looks at us,<br />It's very complicated.
800634 801635 Right. We're all clear.
802720 805390 So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
805682 807392 I need to find my father,
807517 809394 and I know that the F-Seven can help.
810061 814399 We know the F-Seven very well,<br />and their schedule is fully booked.
814566 817402 Leave it to me,<br />I'll find your father within the month.
817444 819029 I can do it in one week.
819071 820781 - Four days! - Three days!
820823 822116 - Two days! - One!
822200 823075 Oomph!
823117 825327 I already found your<br />father like, two weeks ago.
825411 826496 Really?
826579 829540 I just need a few days<br />to get him across state lines.
829582 831584 I seriously need to find my dad.
831626 836047 Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven<br />in over a year, right?
836173 839510 You're not going to find them now,<br />we're your best bet.
840886 844265 Wow. No-ones offered to<br />help me for such a long time.
845266 846392 You guys are awesome
846433 849771 Really? You think we are awesome?
849812 855109 Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...
855151 857988 And not completely hideous to look at?
858155 861366 No, you guys are totally adorable.
861408 863286 I think I hit her too hard.
863327 866205 But she is beautiful.
867373 869833 She can help me break the curse.
874839 878093 Who is coming to my birthday party?
878177 880054 Has Ariel RSVP'd?
880095 882764 She says she can't make it, sir.<br />She has to wax her legs.
882806 884099 But she's a mermaid!
884183 885310 What about Sleeping Beauty?
885351 886561 Doctor's appointment.
886602 888729 - Is she sick?<br />- Says she has insomnia.
888771 891023 If she's not gonna sleep,<br />she can come to our party.
891065 892067 What about Rapunzel?
892108 895236 And don't tell me she's<br />getting her hair done.
895278 898489 Nope. It's something called, uh, book.
898573 899533 Princess Cruise?
899575 900701 That's a ship, sir.
900742 901410 Princess Leia?
901452 902618 She's a general!
902618 905370 I demand glorious guests!
905580 908834 How can I be any more unpopular!
908875 911544 And I don't understand, why?
914048 916842 Greetings, Prince Average.
916883 919428 It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.
919553 920929 Sure it is.
921222 924809 If you're here for the 'We Love<br />Our Peasants' group giveaway,
924851 927728 that motion is ended.<br />Grab your wrinkles and go.
927895 928896 Move along.
933150 936739 Do you think that people would respect you,
936780 943662 if you celebrated your birthday with<br />a beautiful woman on your arm?
943955 947125 Finally, someone talking sense!
947166 949001 This horrible crone gets it!
949042 951713 May I suggest inviting
952088 954298 this young lady?
955383 958137 She's beautiful, when can she get here?
958178 960014 Well, that's up to you.
960139 963725 You see, she's stolen something from me.
963933 969815 You find her, bring her along with you,<br />and you won't look like such a loser,
969982 973111 and I get my shoes back.
973278 975280 Fear not, loyal hag.
975321 977448 I, Prince Average,
977573 981453 shall find this fugitive,<br />and make her pay for her crimes,
981578 983622 by making her attend my birthday party.
984748 987168 There shall be balloons!
987251 990629 I just thought of it.<br />Let's have a lot of balloons!
990963 992839 What a buffoon.
1001433 1003393 It looks just like papa.
1009232 1010817 Papa won't recognise me.
1016740 1021161 Why won't... why won't these<br />shoes just come off?
1027793 1030505 Yes, this is me.
1038806 1042476 Would you like to join me<br />in a moisturising mask?
1042642 1045605 Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...
1046522 1047523 Oh!
1047523 1048566 So tired.
1048608 1049900 Are you sure?
1050067 1052863 It's very important to take<br />care of your skin.
1052904 1053905 Positive.
1056032 1059411 But this is the finest French<br />recipe meant to hydrate skin.
1059828 1062122 It is made of French poopee!
1063457 1064458 Papa?
1065626 1069964 Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.
1070256 1071715 Oh, there it is.
1072049 1074344 Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?
1074386 1076596 Have you checked in the kitchen?
1076763 1080141 Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!
1082645 1084562 Now, where was I?
1085355 1087607 Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?
1089193 1090569 - It's nowhere to be... - No!
1090611 1093781 Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.<br />Now please, go away.
1093822 1095909 Someone's got anger management issues.
1099996 1102582 Getting a kiss was never<br />a problem with this face.
1105419 1106420 Red Shoes?
1108462 1109798 Papa?
1110465 1112216 Papa? Are you there?
1113134 1114177 Papa?
1137118 1141415 Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are<br />the way to a woman's heart.
1143750 1146921 It works! I call it, an auto portrait.
1146963 1148589 I call it, the duplicatertron.
1148630 1150091 I call it, selfie!
1150132 1151800 Red Shoes must love it!
1151842 1153303 Monsieur, monsieur.
1153345 1156013 She doesn't want sweets and selfies.
1156181 1158516 Women want diamonds.
1158766 1159767 Merlin?
1166024 1169820 The Book of Spells To Make You Fall In Love?
1173949 1177621 Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.
1177662 1179122 You're a nice bunny.
1179914 1182125 You're a Vegan bunny, right?
1185712 1188089 What was that? Lightning?
1188215 1190718 Actually, it's called magic. I do it.
1190760 1193012 Really? Then do some!
1194054 1195765 ♪ Darling...
1197183 1200811 ♪ Wish you could see what can I see
1201354 1205108 ♪ Miles ahead just you and me
1205484 1208487 ♪ To infinity
1213741 1216577 Keep running, and whatever<br />you do, don't look back.
1216619 1217912 But I can't leave without you.
1218163 1220416 You're looking back. Don't do that.
1220624 1221625 But...
1222376 1224252 Hate to zap you longears,
1224460 1226923 But I need to impress a beautiful woman.
1227089 1229258 Big, scary bunny! Over here!
1229300 1231302 Red! Stop putting yourself in...
1233513 1235182 ...danger...
1254953 1256663 Arthur! I got you.
1256913 1259373 It's no use, Red Shoes.
1259415 1263087 I'm slippin' away. Not much time...
1263128 1266256 Just... need to... use that core of mine...
1266298 1268800 I see the light at the end of the funnel.
1269050 1272513 Time for me to kick the bucket
1272555 1274556 I had a good run. I was God blessed.
1274598 1278603 Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!
1278811 1281981 Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
1282022 1285068 Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.
1285319 1288029 Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.
1288071 1290323 And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.
1290365 1292618 No, No, No. I'm fine, but Arthur, he's stuck.
1292659 1294120 He tried to save me and...
1294161 1295621 Would you get up?
1296038 1297664 What? He's not hurt?
1297831 1300252 - Only his pride.<br />- Seriously Arthur?
1300377 1302795 You need to find a better<br />way to hit on girls.
1312139 1315016 Stand back! I may have to risk my life.
1324317 1326194 Someone call for three inventors?
1326361 1327821 For three geniuses?
1328406 1329907 That sounds like us!
1331158 1334620 Everyone came runnin' to help,<br />great, just great.
1334662 1336372 Everyone except Merlin, that is.
1336414 1338624 Ah! Super, there he is now.
1339250 1340126 Where have you been?
1340168 1342922 Something awful could've happened<br />to Red if I hadn't shown up.
1342963 1344048 You?
1344798 1347008 Don't even go there!
1347384 1349554 I saved her first.
1350680 1352598 - Right?<br />- I was worried about you.
1352723 1354642 I was worried about me too.
1354975 1357812 - But mostly you.<br />- No-one needs to worry.
1357854 1360106 Arthur's here. Please, my lady.
1360231 1361524 Um... Okay.
1370784 1372870 You shouldn't go into the<br />forest by yourself.
1373079 1378125 It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for<br />bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
1378543 1379669 ...And squirrels.
1379836 1381546 I thought I saw my father.
1382213 1384966 Turned out, just to be that big bunny.
1385132 1389137 Well, if you ever make such a dangerous<br />and weird mistake again,
1389304 1391473 just know that I can protect you.
1391973 1393267 This's very kind.
1393309 1397938 And if you really want to express<br />your gratitude, you can...
1399732 1402193 Oh, I am so sorry.
1402235 1407532 This was much slappier than<br />I intended it to be.
1407907 1410327 Oh! It happens. No problem.
1411035 1413287 Maybe an apology kiss then?
1415916 1417334 Bravo mon ami!
1417835 1419210 Nice try.
1419878 1421420 Red Shoes.
1426176 1429639 Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going<br />to have to work as a tightly knit team.
1429764 1431682 Which means, you do everything I say.
1431766 1433308 - Excuse? - Huh? - What? - No.
1433350 1434101 You got to be kidding.
1434143 1436396 Hans and Jack will search around the Dismal Lake.
1436479 1439357 Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.
1439482 1442527 Red Shoe and I, will go to Golden Goose Avenue.
1442652 1447323 Golden Goose Avenue, which happens<br />to be your go to place for dates.
1447448 1449660 We are going to focus on the mission.
1449826 1452121 And then see where the evening takes us.
1452413 1456583 The only thing you're going to shop for<br />on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.
1456625 1458295 And you can't even afford that.
1458461 1461047 I like my odds. You saw what she did.
1461088 1463424 An expression of affection.
1463591 1465427 Every woman shows it differently.
1465552 1467054 You took your shot. You got slapped.
1467095 1468138 May I remind you
1468180 1472059 that this is the closest thing to a<br />kiss anyone's had since the curse.
1473144 1476730 Let's work together to guide<br />Red Shoes' feelings towards me
1476772 1478607 so we can break the curse.
1478649 1479943 What about the rest of us?
1479984 1482486 After I resume my princely form,
1482653 1485114 the word about F-Seven will be out.
1485156 1488910 Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.
1488993 1490787 - Really?<br />- Sounds reasonable.
1490870 1492372 I'll bring the gelato!
1492414 1495000 Getting one kiss sure is easier<br />than getting seven.
1495084 1497962 This is not a plan,<br />he's just out for himself!
1498003 1500005 A half baked plan is better than none.
1500047 1503634 Don't worry Merlin,<br />I have a big assignment for you.
1504302 1505886 Big assignment?
1506221 1508389 Here you go. I drew these up last night.
1508764 1512143 I can't tell if this drawing is terrible, or
1512769 1514479 really avant garde.
1514604 1516815 Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.
1516983 1518359 Pablo Picassover?
1518400 1522195 One thing's for sure,<br />daddy's on the big side...
1522778 1524365 ...of big.
1525532 1526950 You must take after your mother.
1527158 1528409 No, I look a lot like papa... Oh!
1529410 1535667 Yeah, my mother. Gosh! We... exactly! Twins!
1536502 1539339 Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.
1539381 1542174 Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!
1544636 1546138 And where d'ya think you're going?
1546471 1548181 Your post is right there.
1548265 1550850 You'll watch the savage monster.<br />I call him Vicious!
1550892 1552435 I call him Woodbottom.
1552520 1554938 Do not worry Merlin. We'll make<br />sure you get kissed too.
1555188 1556399 Eventually.
1557983 1559192 We'll split up here.
1559234 1560987 Alright, see you later.
1561863 1564823 I know exactly where we should<br />look to find your father.
1565074 1566575 Really? Where?
1574627 1575753 Daddy!
1576045 1577046 Wow!
1578047 1579214 Is this what I think it is?
1579256 1585305 I present Excalibur, the legendary<br />sword trapped in this rock for centuries.
1585680 1589059 Waiting for a man of great<br />strength to release it.
1589100 1592353 It says 'Do not attempt to remove by force'.
1592437 1594940 ...Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.
1595273 1601363 The truth is, I realized you were the woman<br />of my destiny the first time I saw you.
1601697 1604409 I thought if I could show you my strength
1604659 1606869 I would be worthy of your affections.
1610791 1611791 Oh!
1612292 1614252 Oops, I'll put it back.
1614294 1615962 No No No! Can I have it?
1626348 1629517 Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.
1629851 1632104 You want me to, maybe pull<br />it out for you again?
1632354 1634607 No, I'm not humiliated at all.
1635399 1636442 Let's go.
1646035 1649789 Don't look at me like that,<br />I'm the real prisoner here.
1650039 1652125 What? You hungry?
1653585 1655170 And fetch!
1663138 1664889 Hop along, big guy!
1665097 1667850 There's no way Arthur is<br />breaking this curse alone!
1684827 1685912 Woah!
1687664 1689456 Arthur, where're you going?
1692710 1693711 Okay.

2392998 2395709 Now, here's the good news.<br />It's my birthday!
2395876 2399338 And you are going to be<br />the belle of the ball.
2399380 2403134 The invitation sounds great,<br />really. But...
2403217 2405469 It wasn't an invitation,<br />more of an order.
2405594 2406554 Prepare the lady's carriage.
2406595 2409141 She said she doesn't want to go, Average.
2409183 2412102 Avv-vous-rarge!
2412227 2413853 Don't troll me, Troll.
2414229 2415355 Ah! So rude.
2415397 2417650 I couldn't agree more.<br />Subjects these days.
2417692 2418818 Now. Shall we?
2427410 2428411 Get her!
2428661 2430330 You hold off the guards, and<br />I'll get her out of here.
2430371 2433417 No, I'm faster. You stay<br />here and buy us time.
2441758 2442551 Here's a thought.
2442759 2444928 Stop fighting and fight!
2446473 2447515 What's the plan?
2448558 2450017 Rescue Red Shoes.
2450059 2451977 Like the old days, guys.
2486973 2487974 Arthur!
2493980 2496150 Can we get this over with?<br />They're just dwarfs!
2508454 2510916 Did you guys hear something?
2519967 2520968 Come on!
2541365 2542366 Duck!
2548539 2550834 Hi, guards, are we taking a break?
2550917 2552043 ...well, FYI
2552085 2554337 They're getting away!
2561218 2562345 No!
2568351 2570687 Who's throwin' vegetables?
2575233 2578112 Yeah! You just got Merlined!
2586287 2587288 Run!
2588706 2589707 Jack!
2600427 2601428 Duck!
2606351 2608102 I'm so sorry. You alright?
2608227 2610479 No. I'm not.
2616194 2619197 Gentlemen, he surrenders.
2619406 2620408 What?
2650440 2651857 Engines. Full power.
2651941 2652942 Shields up.
2653901 2655445 Turn on the mini frizzer.
2674214 2675716 Superhero landing!
2675882 2676842 Hooray for us!
2676883 2679261 - We did it!<br />- It was mostly me.
2679303 2680304 Yeah!
2680804 2681805 What?
2685268 2686519 You've got to be kidding.
2686603 2689105 Finally the big guns, thank you.
2689355 2690356 Fire!
2698656 2699658 Fire!
2705581 2707125 Ooh, close.
2707458 2709252 The cannonball. Not you.
2709961 2712296 Timeout, timeout.<br />Everyone, timeout.
2712671 2715967 You almost blew her up, and she can't<br />come to my party if you blow her up.
2716009 2717135 Sorry, sir.
2717511 2718970 Alright. Time back in.
2719971 2721181 Surrender monsters!
2721223 2722391 No! Wait!
2754926 2756260 Oh. That's pretty cool.
2764142 2766062 Everyone inside. And hurry!
2780035 2782455 You messed with the wrong prince.
2782621 2785290 There is nothing average about Avv-vous-rarge.
2785498 2788753 I shall return!
2788962 2789879 On Tuesday.
2789921 2792256 No, wait. I'll check my calendar...
2792298 2796386 Thursday, I shall return Thursday!
2797762 2799013 We'll be ready.
2799055 2799848 And waiting.
2799931 2800890 Arrivederci!
2800932 2801934 Ciao for now!
2802017 2802768 Bye bye!
2802893 2804519 You just got dwarfed!
2804644 2806688 Is that better? I think Merlined is better.
2822915 2827461 You should have seen the look on his big<br />ugly face when bunny came running at him.
2828504 2830673 That's how you see everything, isn't it?
2830715 2832008 With my eyes?
2832216 2835094 You always talk about<br />what someone looks like.
2835177 2837680 I do? I wouldn't say that.
2837722 2840308 But I can't wait for you<br />to see the real me.
2840600 2842477 What kind of Merlin is the real you?
2842685 2844103 You might not believe it,
2844186 2847733 but the real me is famous,<br />handsome, and even popular.
2847900 2850861 Not short, stumpy and green.
2850986 2854282 Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but
2854323 2857243 you're also a wonderful and charming person.
2857285 2858786 I'm not explaining it right.
2858869 2862457 If you saw the real me,<br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
2863290 2865250 I think I can see the real you.
2865876 2869088 And I like you, just as you are.
2870965 2872258 That's hilarious.
2872550 2876388 Here, close your eyes,<br />and imagine the real me.
2876888 2879390 I guarantee you, it'll be different.
2881060 2884688 I do feel something different ..
2884897 2885898 Really?
2886106 2888318 But eyes opened or closed
2888401 2890653 to me you're still Merlin.
2892029 2896577 Now tell me, who am I to you?
2897160 2898704 You're a gift.
2898829 2903042 A gift that'll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
2903750 2905836 Just like you're amazing.
2914095 2917140 Actually, I want to show you something too.
2921728 2923145 You need a hand?
2923271 2926650 Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.
2927275 2928819 ...One...
2928861 2930612 Two, yeah, okay, I need help.
2948924 2950425 Woah. Woah woah woah.
2950425 2952219 No thank you.
2958308 2961479 You know what the weird thing is?<br />They're super comfortable.
2963732 2967067 Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were<br />you when the facade was falling?
2967109 2969237 I mean, that was terrifying.
2971071 2972156 What're you doing here?
2974158 2976077 I have come for my shoes.
2976369 2980748 Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.<br />But those dwarfs!
2980748 2983294 It's dwarves with a 'v'.<br />So you failed?
2984003 2988006 I did not fail, I took a timeout.
2988089 2990092 Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.
2990134 2992261 I'm going to return on Thursday,<br />we all pencilled it in.
2992386 2993387 Silence!
2993680 2995181 Have a bite.
2995723 2997184 For strength.
2997850 3002021 Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.
3002063 3004733 I don't have much time, Prince.
3005025 3009029 You could still have the<br />best birthday ever,
3009196 3010656 But remember...
3010698 3017330 What's bad for me,<br />will be very bad for you.
3023419 3024420 She's gone.
3025630 3027925 Ah! What's the worst that could happen.
3031970 3032971 It's kind of sweet.
3049240 3050241 Don't move.
3050366 3050907 Okay.
3050949 3053034 Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.
3053076 3053994 Okey doky!
3054035 3054828 Here we go!
3054870 3055997 Our pleasure.
3063255 3065757 ...here we go, yeah, a little
3065757 3066924 Oooh a little over here!
3083650 3085444 Now that looks like a real home.
3085486 3087445 Yep. I could get used to that.
3087655 3088864 Uh uh. I cannot.
3092535 3095538 It's a perfect copy of my drawing.<br />That's incredible.
3096872 3098123 Let me try.
3099293 3101628 This will definitely make it easier to<br />find your dad.
3101711 3104005 Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.
3104047 3104881 It's grounded.
3104923 3105925 Why does it need to fly?
3105966 3108718 The posters are no good if we<br />can't distribute them fast.
3108969 3112889 Guys, thank you so much for<br />everything you're doing.
3113391 3115393 - My pleasure.<br />- It's nice.
3184966 3186010 Opening doors!
3202068 3205280 You know Merlin, I feel so<br />lucky that I've met you.
3205989 3207866 I feel the same way.
3208284 3211620 I feel like anything is possible.
3212954 3214414 ♪ Darling
3216125 3219962 ♪ Come on out there and take my hand
3220296 3224092 ♪ I will show you that I'm your man
3224176 3227094 ♪ Is that okay
3227887 3230015 Merlin! Watch out!
3241026 3242445 Merlin.
3244280 3245323 Merlin.
3246616 3247617 Merlin!
3248034 3249535 Everything okay?
3249953 3251163 Of course! Sure!
3251956 3253207 Nothing to be embarrassed about.
3253248 3257461 So why are we even talking about<br />that when we should be going...
3257502 3258504 this direction.
3258671 3259672 Hey wait!
3263383 3266304 So, about these magic shoes.
3266471 3267680 Why, are they still bothering you?
3267722 3269724 What kind of magic do<br />those shoes have?
3270100 3273103 Well .. How do I put this.
3273312 3277064 Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.
3277482 3279692 And, I was always proud of that.
3279734 3284780 But, the shoes magic, umm,<br />it made me a little dainty?
3284906 3285949 Sorry to hear.
3285991 3290287 The shoes made me lose<br />a little bit of weight.
3290496 3291705 It could be worse.
3291747 3293081 ...Okay.
3294082 3295668 - A lot of weight.<br />- Ah.
3296753 3300881 Well, I know what it's like to look different on<br />the outside from what you feel on the inside.
3305553 3309600 Merlin, I'd like to give you a<br />token of my appreciation.
3311018 3313020 Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.
3313228 3313729 Why?
3313771 3316399 Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.
3317608 3318609 Give me a second.
3331040 3334918 There. Consider it your good luck charm.
3338381 3339465 Thank you.
3346014 3349809 Merlin, do you think we'd be happier
3350101 3352312 if we were our old selves again?
3352478 3355231 Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.
3355399 3356650 I don't know.
3357776 3359360 I like how we are.
3360112 3363490 Right here, just, right now.
3364158 3367870 Even if I'm an ugly green monster?
3369372 3372959 I don't care about your height<br />or what colour you are.
3373876 3377422 And that's the way you feel about me, right?
3377547 3380674 Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!
3382344 3386138 I think we're both just trapped<br />under the same spell.
3402406 3408537 Wait. Keep your eyes closed<br />and don't open them until I say.
3408705 3410791 When you open your eyes there will be...
3411000 3413668 a handsome man in front of you.
3413710 3415170 Someone worthy of you.
3415212 3417422 Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.
3418633 3419800 I think you're right.
3419884 3422427 Ready? And...
3422762 3425932 Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!
3428434 3429435 Now!
3429894 3431062 Ta-da!
3431229 3434232 You just got Merlined!
3434441 3435609 What do you think?
3436026 3439279 Mission impossibly handsome, right?
3441032 3444410 Oh, it's okay,<br />I know this is a lot to take in.
3444743 3447289 But you can let your happiness flag fly.
3447330 3451250 This, this is the real me.
3452168 3454254 - It's stupid.<br />- What?
3455422 3456631 Wait a minute!
3457090 3459634 My hands are still green sausages.
3460760 3462930 No! I look the same.
3463181 3465724 Yes, impossibly handsome.
3465766 3467935 This doesn't make sense.
3468060 3471064 You're the most beautiful woman in<br />the world, why do I look the same?
3471272 3473191 What're you talking about, Merlin?
3473232 3474650 Do I need a longer kiss?
3475109 3476111 Two kisses?
3476987 3478572 Let's try again.
3479114 3480114 Umm.
3480114 3481533 You're not making any sense.
3490792 3491793 Hurry!
3493753 3494754 What is that?
3495046 3497632 This kingdom has a serious<br />monster problem.
3513525 3514067 Are you alright?
3514109 3516027 No. I'm not.
3524536 3525162 Thank you.
3525204 3526455 Pleasure, milady.
3528791 3529792 Watch out!
3547436 3549480 Ha-hah! Yes!
3555569 3558031 What do they want,<br />besides smashing us?
3558073 3559073 I don't know!
3568083 3569626 The old me would've nailed that.
3578136 3579513 You just got Merlined!
3590481 3591482 Hurry!
3606874 3608335 Red, close your eyes.
3608376 3610211 This is no time for kissing, Merlin.
3610252 3612379 Trust me. Close your eyes.
3613590 3615258 Please, close them!
3619930 3621349 That was too close.
3622141 3623559 Don't look at me.
3623726 3625728 You see that tree on the<br />other side of the bridge?
3625769 3626354 Yeah.
3626395 3629398 On my signal, run towards<br />it as fast as you can.
3629440 3630942 No, I can't leave you here.
3631109 3634320 You have to.<br />And don't look back, okay?
3634487 3636865 Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.
3636990 3638575 Promise you won't look.
3638617 3641077 Okay. I promise.
3641661 3642662 Now!
3674155 3675156 What?
3675197 3677491 You just got Merlined?<br />Oh. Yes you did.
3706522 3708231 Hey! Locate!
3709275 3711027 Hey, locate here!
3711319 3714363 You're even more of a blockhead<br />than Prince Average.
3716575 3719035 Avv-vous-rarge!
3719328 3720787 Prince Average?
3737054 3738640 You just got Merlined.
3742227 3743561 Take a look, Red Shoes.
3743895 3744437 Merlin!
3744479 3746941 I have triumphantly saved the day.
3748109 3749110 Merlin, no!
3751528 3752822 Merlin!
3757660 3758953 Merlin!
3823772 3825274 Snow White?
3834784 3836452 Snow White?
3836786 3839664 The thief was Snow White<br />this whole time?
3839748 3843251 Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
3845044 3847506 You're going after her yourself?
3847590 3849132 What? Were you going to go?
3849842 3852344 I get it! I don't have legs.
3854931 3858309 So, here I am.
3859393 3860561 All the real me.
3862189 3863607 I bet you're disappointed, huh?
3863815 3866860 You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.
3866901 3867443 Red Shoes!
3867486 3870823 That's not my name, it's Snow White.
3870948 3873450 Princess Snow White? So your father is...
3873492 3875911 King White, yeah.
3876246 3879790 By the time I figured out his<br />new wife Regina was a witch
3880833 3882669 he'd already disappeared.
3883211 3885714 And the monsters who attacked us
3885756 3889760 were sent by my stepmother<br />to get these shoes.
3891053 3894014 I guess being beautiful is really<br />worth that much to her.
3894348 3897267 Have you thought about<br />just giving them back?
3898268 3899895 And give up their magic?
3901104 3904691 If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't<br />have helped me find my father, would you?
3905651 3906986 Would you?
3910781 3913242 I thought we were both<br />under the same spell.
3914494 3917789 But I see now that I was wrong.
3918205 3923711 Listen, I can't get into all the details,<br />but I'm under a curse too.
3924129 3926048 You still don't get it, Merlin.
3927258 3929760 I'm not talking about our curses.
3930469 3933263 Merlin, I'm talking about<br />the kind of spell
3934473 3936559 you never want to break.
3985278 3987780 He likes you more than he likes me.
4019688 4023026 What would've happened if she'd taken<br />off her shoes that day in the barn?
4023067 4024486 You think that's important?
4027071 4028824 I just wonder,
4028824 4031827 what I would've done if I'd<br />seen the real Snow White.
4032077 4033453 Seriously?
4033537 4035831 It's still all about appearance for you.
4036040 4038751 No! Not exactly.

4042756 4047052 Kind of proving my point, other me.<br />Alright. Let's try this.
4047552 4050222 Who do you like more,<br />Snow White or Red Shoes?
4050389 4052308 Easy, it's Red Shoes.
4052474 4055143 Now, which of us do you<br />think Red Shoes likes more?
4055226 4056938 Easy, it's me!
4058856 4061483 Wait. No.
4062068 4063235 It's...

4160089 4161799 I thought you left.
4162008 4163551 You should take them off again.
4168848 4169849 I can't.
4170642 4173603 You just had to make things complicated.
4174646 4176023 Maybe this will help.
4176231 4178567 Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.
4178608 4179734 Where did you get that?
4180026 4182322 I want to help you, Snow White.
4182572 4183573 Please.
4190246 4191247 Red Shoes?
4191831 4192832 Merlin?
4193749 4194751 Merlin?
4197588 4200048 What terrible timing you have.
4203052 4205053 We're gonna have to do this the hard way.
4205762 4206762 Regina?
4210184 4213144 Such a tender family reunion.
4213479 4215606 So sad we can't stay!
4216441 4217525 Red Shoes!
4219986 4221904 Come on, let's go, longears.
4221946 4223489 Hey! Wait for us!
4223530 4225575 How 'bout you go back<br />and get the others?
4225742 4227702 And make lots of copies of this.
4228286 4229287 Let's go!
4231790 4233125 We can do this.
4233166 4234167 Yeah!
4236586 4239048 Your power my lady. It has drained you.
4239132 4243010 You think? I don't need<br />you to tell me how I look.
4243177 4245388 I'm a mirror. It's what I do.
4245430 4248307 M - I - R - O - R.<br />I can't spell.
4248349 4249350 Enough.
4250518 4251770 Bind her.
4252813 4254940 It's snack time.
4258568 4260780 How can you sleep at<br />a time like this?
4262448 4265117 I'm not supposed to talk<br />when I have this on,
4265159 4268579 but I got to ask.<br />Do you think they've kissed yet?
4268663 4269664 I hope so,
4269748 4272708 because it'll feel better to<br />punch Merlin when he's pretty.
4273918 4277088 We've been waiting for a...<br />Where have you been?
4277130 4278131 Did you break the curse yet?
4278173 4279841 Merlin, are you hungry?
4280050 4281176 Those are bears.
4281217 4282219 Ah...
4282219 4285097 Hi? This is from Merlin.
4303492 4305453 Wow! This is so cool.
4309331 4310707 Okay, sword.
4310874 4315671 If you think you've humiliated, embarrassed,<br />and otherwise frustrated me,
4316171 4317339 you're right.
4317840 4321510 But that ends now!
4331104 4333148 Oh, zut alors. Please end this.
4344785 4348874 Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.
4348915 4350250 The castle's over there.
4367184 4368185 Sit.
4379823 4383661 Eat this darling, and you'll<br />get your freedom.
4383827 4385163 Where is my father?
4385829 4389833 Royal loyal little girl,<br />pining for her papa?
4390250 4394547 This is getting a little boring, so I need<br />you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.
4394673 4396090 I won't let you win.
4396507 4399970 You've torn apart my family,<br />and you will not get away with it, Regina.
4401013 4403848 Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.
4404140 4407102 Very well. A different approach.
4415777 4416778 - Merlin!<br />- No!
4417237 4419782 Eat the apple, or watch him die.
4419949 4420825 That's your choice.
4420866 4422743 Don't do it. No!
4422785 4424662 No!
4426121 4427123 Red Shoes!
4427123 4429375 Promise to me, you'll let him go.
4429542 4432837 Oh absolutely.<br />When the third bell chimes,
4433046 4435966 everything will be just<br />like it used to be.
4436091 4438385 No! No no no.
4440596 4442389 Save my papa for me.
4452859 4454361 Red Shoes!
4469167 4473798 A legendary handsome knight,<br />fearless rescuer of princesses.
4473923 4479013 Sitting in a tree,<br />not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.
4480180 4481848 Burn. I can't spell.
4484183 4485645 You don't have to do this.
4485686 4487772 Just take the shoes and let us go.
4488230 4490983 I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.
4491108 4494112 The fruit of temptation and want.<br />They feed on your desires
4494154 4498616 Once they give you what you desire,<br />the bond is permanent.
4498824 4501077 That's not true. She took<br />them off in the river.
4501161 4502829 That doesn't make any sense.
4502871 4507501 How could she possibly want to save you<br />more than she wanted to be beautiful?
4507752 4509837 What did you do to her?
4510087 4512006 Did you cast a spell?
4514134 4515676 What's going to happen to her?
4515717 4520639 Well, once she eats the apple, its magic<br />will turn her into a magic apple tree.
4520681 4523768 The first bell, nothing really happens,<br />but very dramatic.
4523976 4526270 The tree bears fruit,<br />and the second bell...
4526312 4528523 Oh! Excitement mounts!
4528773 4530733 The morning sun touches the fruit
4530858 4533445 turning it into a new<br />pair of red shoes
4533486 4536448 And number three, the circle of life!
4536824 4537825 And then what?
4537950 4541453 Regina will be the most<br />beautiful person in the kingdom.
4541829 4542745 Forever.
4542787 4545666 I don't care about her,<br />what about Snow White?
4545833 4550045 The tree withers and dies,<br />and so does Snow White.
4550087 4551881 No!
4552006 4553717 Yes!
4554508 4558263 Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.
4575156 4577992 Why don't you come back and play?
4584332 4585709 Not so fast.
4595470 4596596 It's gonna hurt.
4600266 4603311 Oh yeah! Stretch it out.
4614907 4616117 Uh-oh.
4620412 4621579 Smoke! Smoke!
4621788 4623749 We're here, bitch. Are you okay?
4623791 4625251 Yeah.
4625834 4627836 I never thought I'd say this,
4628546 4630840 but I'm so glad to be chubby<br />and green again.
4631633 4634844 Seven to one.<br />I like those odds.
4635053 4636095 Let's go.
4638057 4640059 We like those odds even better.
4642894 4644647 Are you up to this, muchacho?
4645815 4648192 You finally pulled out Excalibur.
4648317 4652447 Oh, yes, yes. I did it.<br />That's exactly how it went down.
4652488 4654740 Here you go Merlin.<br />You're gonna need these.
4654782 4655783 Thanks.
4661498 4663792 Here comes the sun.
4664250 4666086 Now let's all get dwarfed.
4670007 4674512 Ah, this is where your<br />fairy tale ends, trolls.
4679141 4680142 You missed.
4717016 4718768 Au revoir, mirror!
4733866 4735118 Finally.
4743794 4746505 It's a good day to break a curse.
4748174 4750384 Eternal Beauty.
4763606 4764607 I'm sorry
4765150 4766484 Snow White.
4769572 4772783 Ahhh!
4799812 4802523 Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.
4808905 4809865 Woah! We're back!
4809906 4810949 Yippee!
4821377 4822378 Papa?
4832513 4833890 Snow White?
4836183 4837268 Oh papa!
4837394 4838394 Snow!
4843650 4844651 Wait.
4844817 4846069 Where's Merlin?
4846194 4847862 I'm so sorry.
4848322 4852284 He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
4852743 4854411 Merlin, no!
4857456 4859000 Merlin!
4919522 4921150 I thought you were gone.
4921985 4926280 You're the most beautiful<br />woman in the world.
4928116 4930618 With my eyes open
4932370 4933829 or closed.
4945133 4946134 No.
4963528 4965363 I got Merlined.
4990557 4992184 You're a prince, Merlin.
4999775 5002445 Yeah, that Merlin.
5002862 5005864 The one who's not really your type.
5009619 5012205 I kind of liked the short<br />and green Merlin.
5014624 5017169 But I'm still that Merlin inside.
5018253 5020880 Yes, yes you are.
