24074 27870 This is Fairytale Island.
27911 34126 A magical land of princes and princess,<br />and witches and monsters.
34167 39089 Here - accidents from strange events<br />happen all the time.
39131 46346 That's when people call us - The Fearless 7 -<br />the greatest heroes on Fairytale Island.
46388 49349 Especially ME - Merlin.
49391 56481 But everything changed the day we defeated<br />a dragon and saved a princess.
56523 61361 We thought we'd saved a witch -<br />so we attacked her.
61403 68243 But we were wrong. She wasn't a witch --<br />she was a princess.
68285 70704 The FAIRY princess!
70746 72164 How were we supposed to know?
72205 77711 She looked like a witch, and everyone knows<br />that a princess doesn't look like a witch.
77753 82549 Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson.<br />So, she put a curse on us.
82591 84509 And this was a nasty one,
84552 89181 that turned us into ugly little green monsters<br />whenever people looked at us.
89222 95395 And the only way to break the curse is to get<br />a kiss from the most beautiful woman in the world.
95437 97522 Are you kidding me?
97565 99567 With this face?
145696 147948 Hello, your majesty.
148031 149282 Good morning ma'am.
149324 150701 Good morning.
154622 164965 Magic tree, magic tree let this morning be the time<br />that you perform your duty...
170596 179187 ...Of bringing me the shoes of youthful,<br />eternal beauty.
186737 187696 Yes.
187738 188989 WOW!
189031 194578 Change me... Finally.
199499 201627 Not again! How long must I wait?!
201669 202085 Oh No.
202127 203712 Clear these away!
203754 205255 Oh head down.
205338 206882 Oh, pull yourself together.
210678 211804 Here you are.
212429 214557 Oh! Thanks!
236704 239414 Huh? That wasn't here before.
239456 241083 What is she up to now?
282791 283500 Huh?
287504 289047 You weren't here before.
293802 294427 Whatever.
299349 300183 Owe!
304688 305480 Yes!
308609 313321 I can't believe my beloved daughter<br />Snow White has turned eighteen.
313405 319995 I only wish her mother could see the kind of smart<br />and beautiful young woman she's become.
320037 322873 Strange thing happened during the party.
322915 326669 The castle guards brought in a woman -<br />named Regina.
326710 332299 They said she was a witch.<br />But she was too beautiful to be a witch.
332340 337429 I have married Regina,<br />Everything feels so perfect!
337470 344269 ...Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.<br />There's something not quite right.
344311 349232 People around the castle<br />have been disappearing one by one.
349274 352152 Is it because of that peculiar mirror?
352194 354404 I saw it with my own eyes!
354446 357240 Regina - talking to a tree!
357282 359451 She must be a witch!
359492 363622 I should send Snow away, to a safer place.
363706 364915 My dear Snow
364957 368919 by the time you read this,<br />my fate will be uncertain.
368961 371213 She's coming for me now.
371254 375508 I only hope you can find The Fearless Seven<br />and ask them for help!
377219 382099 Apples... the most suspicious of fruits.
383350 388146 Oh, papa, where are you.
391066 392693 But they don't look dangerous.
409752 410252 Regina?
410293 414882 No!! My shoes! Get her!
421680 422765 Owe!
422806 423849 Can I borrow this?
423891 424391 Okay.
424474 425350 Thanks!
439948 440824 What?
442284 444161 No!
452169 454880 Short, chubby and green.
456006 457966 Green is like an ogre.
458008 460969 Blue or yellow could have<br />made us look cute and cuddly.
461011 463722 Quit your complaining, Merlin.
463806 467976 I'm figuring out how to take this curse<br />and kick it where the sun don't shine.
468018 472439 Listen, we need to find the most<br />beautifulest princess to kiss us,
472480 474650 and we've just about run out of options!
474692 479112 How would a beautiful woman even see you,<br />Mr. Invisible?
482240 484492 What was that? Some kind of bird?
488789 495462 Magic Mirror full of wisdom,<br />who's the fairest in the kingdom??
495503 498465 The woman who wears the red shoes.
500008 503554 And side-note: "wisdom" and "kingdom"<br />don't really rhyme.
503596 507140 Cut the sass and tell me her name!
507182 507975 Ha!
508016 510102 How should I know? I don't get out much.
510143 512520 Well, you are the magic mirror.
512563 517275 "Magic" is just my first name.<br />It's short for "Magitchard," like Richard.
517317 519903 What can you do then?
519945 524074 I just reflect what I see.<br />The truth. And the truth is,
524116 528829 that you should see yourself right now.
530663 531538 Watch it.
532289 538881 Distribute wanted posters to every town, village,<br />valley, forest and forge in the kingdom and find her!
540674 546346 I feel my power draining. I don't have much time.<br />The aging is accelerating.
546429 550225 And only three bumbling bits of kindling for help.
550267 554354 Perhaps you should recruit another.<br />Someone who stands to gain from your success.
554396 556189 How about this fellow?
557107 563656 Interesting. Tell me more, Magitchard.
564948 567242 Hey, hey, over here, over here!
567284 568702 Si', si' come, very quick!
568744 571121 Look at us! Look, look, look!
571163 572080 What is it?
576710 579046 I know a lot about silhouettes.
579087 581256 And I think this shape... is a witch.
581339 583175 Let's not jump to conclusions.
583216 587012 Yes, it could be a witch, or -- yah, it's a witch.
587054 588847 The witch who cursed us!
588931 591099 Let's catch her and make her break the spell!
609827 610285 En garde!
610327 612370 Wands where I can see 'em, witch!
621504 622172 Fraulein!
622214 623381 NO, NO, NO, Stop!
623465 628470 I baked you some revenge!
629555 630931 beautiful.
630973 633726 I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.
633767 635185 How did she end up with us?
642610 646822 Hello, dear lady.<br />Welcome to my home-slash-command post.
646864 649199 I have six roommates, but my name's on the lease.
649241 650868 I pay the rent.
650909 655288 YOUR home? Oh my gosh, I am, I am so sorry. I was,
655330 657249 I was starving and I wandered into this home --
657332 662004 There's no need to apologize.<br />We didn't mean to interrupt your stolen meal.
662045 665173 If you're still hungry,<br />I can whip up something simple --
665215 667384 You see,<br />I marinate the celery root in a mustard aioli--
667425 668468 Who is that?
670303 672305 Ahh-who?
677269 682107 Wow! I look so...different.
682149 687237 I mean my face, and my waist. My waist? My waist.
687279 689907 Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
691909 694452 Well...
694494 700500 Ha! Must have gotten up so quickly.<br />My back is killing me!
700542 703420 You mean your head, right? Do you need help?
703461 706464 No. I'm fine.
709009 714347 Um, is that really what I look like?<br />In the mirror. Do you see the same thing?
714389 715891 You're beautiful, miss.
715933 717810 Like an angel?
717851 720062 Wow, really?
720103 721063 Could it be...?
721146 723440 Excuse me, but who are you?
723481 724733 Oh, I'm Sno--
724775 726026 "Snot"?
726109 728737 No, no, no, no, no, no.
728779 734451 My name is... Red Shoes.
734492 737287 Yep, it's me, Red Shoes!
737329 741917 Cool name.<br />By any chance would that be "Princess" Red Shoes?
742000 746504 Of course she's a princess!<br />How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?
746546 748841 Obviously! Right, miss?
748882 754179 Obviously...I mean, I am a princess...<br />Who are you guys?
754221 759602 I'm Merlin, part time hero, full time romantic.
759643 762980 And this is Jack, Hans,<br />Arthur, Pino, Noki, and Kio.
763021 766609 No way! Your names are the same as F7!
766650 769653 The Fearless Seven. I'm looking for them!
769695 773073 Let me guess, Merlin's your favorite.
773115 775200 No, not really.
775242 777535 Nah, that Merlin's not your type.
777578 780748 You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
780789 783917 Honestly, none of them are really my type.
786503 792425 Oh. Well, that's fine because we're not them,<br />we're actually completely different people.
792467 797180 In no way are we the same guys put under a curse<br />and changed into different forms,
797222 800225 but only if someone looks at us,<br />it's very complicated..
800267 802352 Glad we're all clear.
802394 805438 So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
805480 809652 I need to find my father.<br />And I know that the F7 can help...
809693 814322 We know the F7 very well,<br />and their schedule is fully booked.
814364 817075 Leave it to me!<br />I'll find your father within the month.
817117 818619 I can do it in one week.
818661 819828 Four days.
819870 820537 Three!
820579 820996 Two!
821038 821914 One!
821955 822873 --and a half.
822915 825083 I already found your father like two weeks ago.
825125 826251 Really?
826293 829212 I just need a few days<br />to get him across state lines.
829254 831339 I seriously need to find my dad.
831381 835594 Hold on.<br />Nobody has seen the F7 in over a year, right?
835678 837470 You're not going to find them now.
837512 839264 We're your best bet.
839306 844770 Wow. No one's offered to help me<br />for such a long time.
844812 845896 You guys are awesome.
845938 849441 Really? You think... we're awesome?
849524 854988 Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...
855030 857700 ...And not completely hideous to look at?
857741 861161 No. You guys are totally adorable.
861203 862955 I think I hit her too hard.
862996 865373 But she is a beautiful
867000 869336 She can help me break the curse.
874633 877845 Who is coming to my birthday party?
877886 879638 Has Ariel rsvp'ed?
879680 882474 She says she can't make it, sir.<br />She has to wax her legs.
882515 883642 But she's a mermaid!
883684 885185 What about Sleeping Beauty?
885227 886311 Doctor's appointment.
886353 887229 Is she sick?
887270 888438 Says she has insomnia.
888480 890733 If she's not going to sleep,<br />she can come to our party.
890774 895070 What about Rapunzel?<br />And don't tell me she's getting her hair done.
895112 898281 No, she's writing something called... a book.
898323 899407 Princess Cruise?
899449 900533 That's a ship, sir.
900576 901243 Princess Leia?
901284 902327 She's a general now.
902369 905080 I demand glorious guests!
905122 908667 I couldn't be any more unpopular.
908709 911294 And I don't understand why.
913546 916424 Greetings, Prince Average.
916466 919136 It's pronounced "AVE-VOO-RAHJ."
919177 921054 Sure it is.
921096 924516 If you're here<br />for the We Love Our Peasants Gruel Giveaway,
924558 927352 that promotion has ended.<br />Grab your wrinkles and go.
927435 928186 Move along.
932900 936444 Do you think the people would respect you
936486 943702 if you celebrated your birthday<br />with a beautiful woman on your arm.
943744 948832 Finally, someone talking sense!<br />This horrible crone gets it.
948874 951835 Then may I suggest inviting...
951877 954046 ...this young lady.
954797 957925 She's beautiful! When can she get here?
957966 963471 Well that's up to you.<br />You see, she's stolen something from me.
963513 969394 You find her, bring her along with you<br />and you won't look like such a loser,
969436 973106 and I get my shoes back.
973148 975067 Fear not, loyal hag.
975108 981198 I, Prince Ave- voo-rahj, shall find this fugitive<br />and make her pay for her crimes.
981239 984409 By making her attend my birthday party!
984451 987079 There shall be balloons!
987120 990833 I just thought of that!<br />Let's have a lot of balloons!
990874 994712 More like buffoons.
1001134 1003053 It looks just like papa.
1008809 1010268 Papa won't recognize me.
1014064 1021029 Huh? Why won't these shoes just, just come off?
1026619 1030288 Oh, yes. This is me.
1038589 1042092 Would you like to join me in a moisturizing mask?
1042133 1048348 Oh, thanks. Oh, oof, but I am so tired.
1048389 1052686 Are you sure?<br />It's very important to take care of your skin.
1052728 1053436 Positive.
1055521 1059401 but this is the finest French recipe meant<br />to hydrate skin.
1059484 1061862 It is made of French poopie!
1062988 1064031 Papa?!
1065783 1070120 A spell that makes you fall in love...
1070162 1071747 Ah. There it is.
1071789 1074166 Merlin, have you seen my cookbook?
1074207 1076459 Have you checked in the kitchen?
1076501 1080213 Ah, silly me. The kitchen. Of course.
1082215 1085177 Now. Where was I?
1085218 1089640 Merlin. Have you seen my moisturizer?<br />It's nowhere to be found...
1089682 1093561 No. Whatever it is. I haven't seen it.<br />Now please - go away.
1093602 1095729 Someone's got anger management issues.
1099733 1102152 Getting a kiss was never a problem with this face.
1105030 1105948 Red Shoes?
1108200 1113581 Papa? Papa, are you there? Papa!
1136687 1141441 Boys, I'm telling you,<br />sweet treats are the way to a woman's heart.
1143526 1146697 It works. I call it an auto- portrait!
1146739 1148365 I call it, the dupli-cata-tron!
1148406 1149825 I call it, selfie!
1149867 1151744 Red Shoes must love it!
1151785 1155706 Monsieur, Monsieur.<br />She doesn't want sweets and selfies.
1155748 1156790 Women want...
1156832 1158208 ...diamonds.
1158291 1159001 Merlin?
1165841 1169678 "The Book of Spells to Make You Fall in Love?"
1172389 1173431 Huh?
1173473 1177519 Okay, big, terrifying wooden bunny.
1177561 1178520 You're a nice bunny.
1178687 1181940 You're a vegan bunny, right?
1185277 1187821 What... was that?... Lightning?
1187863 1189865 Actually, it's called magic.
1189907 1190532 I do it.
1190574 1192826 Really?... Then... do some!
1213556 1216474 Keep running! And whatever you do,<br />don't look back!
1216516 1217601 But I can't leave without you -
1217685 1220437 You're looking back! Don't do that!
1220478 1222105 But...
1222147 1226652 Hate to zap you, long ears.<br />But I gotta impress a beautiful woman.
1226694 1229029 Big, scary bunny! Over here!
1229071 1231073 Red, stop putting yourself in--!
1233200 1234952 Danger...
1254763 1256724 Arthur! I got you!
1256765 1262896 It's no use, Red Shoes.<br />I'm slipping away. Not much time.
1262938 1266066 Just... need to... use that core of mine...
1266108 1268569 I see that light at the end of the funnel.
1268611 1274324 Time for me to kick butt in heaven.<br />I had a good run. Hashtag blessed.
1274366 1278286 Oh I used to be able to bench 250...
1278328 1281749 Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
1281790 1284793 Red Shoes! Oh, thank goodness you're safe.
1284877 1286169 Do you need CPR?
1286211 1289923 I'm basically an expert.<br />And don't worry, I brushed my teeth. Twice.
1289965 1292217 No, no-no-no, I'm fine, but Arthur - he's stuck.
1292259 1293927 He tried to save me,<br />and then he got stuck underneath...
1293969 1295638 Would you get up.
1295679 1297389 What? He's not hurt?
1297430 1298557 Only his pride.
1298599 1302352 Seriously, Arthur.<br />You need to find a better way to hit on girls.
1311820 1314990 Stand back. I may have to risk my life again.
1323791 1325918 Someone call for three inventors?
1325959 1327502 For three geniuses?
1327544 1329421 Ooh! That sounds like us!
1330964 1332382 Everyone came running to help.
1332424 1334092 Great...just great.
1334176 1336178 Everyone except Merlin that is.
1336219 1338764 Ah. Super. There he is now.
1338806 1339807 Where have you been?
1339848 1342810 Something awful could have happened<br />to Red if I hadn't shown up.
1342851 1350233 You?! Don't even... go there... I saved... her first.
1350317 1351109 Right?
1351151 1352360 I was worried about you.
1352402 1356114 I was worried about me too. But mostly you.
1356156 1359993 No one needs to worry.<br />Arthur's here. Please, my lady.
1360035 1361161 Um... OK
1370629 1372881 You shouldn't go into the forest by yourself.
1372923 1378095 It's a nightmarish landscape fit only<br />for bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
1378136 1379471 And squirrels.
1379512 1381807 I thought I saw my father.
1381890 1384517 Turned out just to be that big bunny.
1384560 1388897 Well, if you ever make such a dangerous<br />and weird mistake again,
1388939 1391274 just know that I can protect you.
1391316 1393068 That's very kind.
1393110 1397740 And if you really want<br />to express your gratitude, you can...
1399658 1407374 Oh, I am so sorry!<br />That was much... slapper than I intended it to be.
1407415 1412880 Oh, it happens. No problem.<br />Maybe an apology kiss then?
1415633 1417551 Bravo, mon ami!
1417593 1419637 Nice try.
1419678 1421263 Red Shoes!
1425559 1429271 Gentlemen, to break this curse we're going<br />to have to work as a tightly-knit team.
1429312 1431356 Which means you do everything I say.
1431439 1432065 Excuse me?
1432107 1432524 Huh?
1432566 1432983 What? No.
1433025 1433942 You got to be kidding
1434026 1436236 Hans and Jack will search around the dismal lake.
1436278 1438989 Triplets, you search the caves of despair.
1439031 1442200 Red Shoes and I will go to Golden Goose Avenue.
1442242 1447080 Golden Goose Avenue.<br />Which happens to be your go-to place for dates.
1447122 1452210 We are going to focus on the mission.<br />And then see where the evening takes us.
1452252 1456339 The only thing you're going to shop<br />for on Golden Goose Avenue is rejection.
1456381 1458091 And you can't even afford that.
1458133 1460594 I like my odds. You saw what she did.
1460636 1465140 An expression of affection.<br />Every woman shows it differently.
1465182 1466850 You took your shot, you got slapped.
1466892 1472565 May I remind you that this is the closest thing<br />to a kiss anyone's had since the curse.
1472606 1476526 Let's work together<br />to guide Red Shoes' feelings towards me,
1476569 1478486 so We can break the curse.
1478528 1479655 What about the rest of us?
1479697 1484577 After I resume my princely form,<br />the word about F7 will be out.
1484618 1488538 Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.
1488581 1489289 Really?
1489331 1490498 Sounds reasonable.
1490540 1492167 I'll bring the gelato!
1492209 1494753 Getting one kiss sure is easier than getting seven.
1494795 1497590 This is not a plan! He's just out for himself.
1497631 1499633 A half-baked plan is better than none.
1499675 1503386 Don't worry, Merlin.<br />I have a big assignment for you.
1503428 1505931 Hmph. Big Assignment?
1505973 1508266 Here you go. I drew this up last night.
1508308 1514189 I can't tell if this drawing is terrible<br />or really avant-garde.
1514231 1518193 Awe, my neighbor's a great art teacher,<br />Pablo Picass-ogre.
1518235 1522114 One thing's for sure, Daddy's on the big side
1522197 1524825 ...of big.
1524867 1526577 You must take after your mother.
1526619 1528120 No, I look a lot like pap--
1528161 1535878 Oh, yeah, my mother. Gosh, we, exactly. Twins.
1535919 1537880 Alright, you know the plan.
1537921 1540173 Let's move! Deploy!
1540215 1542009 Thunder dwarfs are go!
1544219 1545929 And where do you think you're going?
1545971 1547890 Your post is right there.
1547931 1549474 You watch the savage monster.
1549516 1550517 I call him vicious.
1550559 1552185 I call him "Woodbottom."
1552227 1554813 Don't worry, Merlin,<br />we'll make sure you get kissed, too.
1554855 1556231 Eventually.
1557566 1559026 we will split up here.
1559067 1560360 Alright. See you later.
1561695 1564615 I know exactly where we should look<br />to find your father!
1564657 1566158 Really? Where?
1574207 1575417 Daddy!
1575500 1577502 Wow!
1577544 1578921 Is this what I think it is?
1578962 1585135 I present Excalibur, a legendary sword trapped<br />in this rock for centuries,
1585177 1588764 waiting for a man of great strength to release it.
1588806 1592059 It says: "Do not attempt to remove by force."
1592142 1594853 Oh, right. I guess, uh,
1594895 1601276 the truth is, I realized you are the woman<br />of my destiny the first time I saw you.
1601318 1604029 I thought if I could show you my strength...
1604071 1606489 ...I would be worthy of your affections.
1610452 1613956 Oh! Oops! I'll put it back.
1614039 1615749 No! No, no, no. Can I hold it?
1626176 1629346 Oh, Arthur, it's just beginners luck.
1629387 1631932 You want me to maybe pull it out for you again?
1631974 1635060 No. I'm not humiliated at all.
1635102 1636103 Let's go.
1645613 1649575 Don't look at me like that.<br />I'm the real prisoner here.
1649617 1651910 What? You're hungry?
1653120 1654997 and fetch
1662880 1667718 Hop along, big guy.<br />There's no way Arthur is breaking this curse alone.
1684484 1685360 Excuse me!
1687237 1689072 Arthur, where are you going?
1691617 1693869 Oh. Okay.
1693952 1695037 See you later.
1696163 1697330 Hi.
1697372 1700292 Oh, look at what you made me do!
1700333 1701418 You...
1701459 1702795 I'm sorry.
1702836 1706423 made me make it perfect. Thank you.
1708884 1710678 I'm so sorry.
1710719 1716224 No. Don't be. I'm sorry. Are you all right? And...
1716266 1718435 don't worry about this.
1721564 1722230 What?
1722314 1723941 Ta-da!
1726276 1728361 Excuse me, have you seen this man?
1791049 1793969 Arthur. I was thinking.
1794011 1798849 What if I just like pull out the Excalibur for you?<br />our secret.
1798891 1801018 Really? We have a secret now?
1801059 1801852 Yeah.
1801894 1806815 I like a girl who can keep things classified.<br />Let's find your pops, Red!
1806857 1807691 Bye Guys

1889648 1890983 Look what I found.
1891024 1894319 Oh, those are mine. Um,<br />can I actually have my shoes back?
1896780 1899491 No way! You're not serious, are you?
1899532 1903411 I'm really not in the mood.<br />Could you just please give'em back to me?
1903453 1905748 Ha! They won't even fit on you!
1905789 1907833 They're gonna fit me better than they fit you.
1907875 1908541 Hey!

1918135 1919637 Red Shoes, where are you?
1921013 1923390 Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.
1926226 1932315 Those dwarfs are not hideous,<br />and I don't need anyone to help me.
1932357 1933400 Ahh-Owe!
1933441 1938155 Freeze! Put the shoes down, get on your knees,<br />and put your hands behind your head.
1938196 1939865 On second thought - they're yours.
1939907 1942993 There's no need to push me into a corner.
1943035 1944578 This is super scary.
1955798 1957549 Your red shoes, m'lady.
1958341 1959301 Thank you.
1959342 1962137 Excuse me miss, have we met?
1962220 1966058 Umm... well...<br />that's kind of a complicated question.
1966099 1967768 Red Shoes?

2045303 2046471 Are you a criminal?
2046513 2048181 No, of course not.
2049099 2052394 I know girl this pretty<br />couldn't possibly be a criminal
2052435 2053646 Look we should head out now.
2053687 2055856 There could be more guards around any minute.
2055898 2058984 Don't worry about them. I've got these bad boys.
2059026 2062487 This is going to make so much harder<br />to find my dad.
2066158 2067325 I have an idea!
2111536 2112495 What do you think?
2112955 2118126 That is amazing. Thank you.
2135227 2138230 You had a thing on your cheek

2181899 2182858 Who's that?
2182941 2184276 It's the girl's father.
2184317 2185736 But where is the girl?
2185778 2188906 It saids to go to risky rock,<br />so she must be there.
2188947 2190532 But why risky rock?
2190574 2192117 We should ask the girl.
2192159 2194494 Perfect! Where is the girl?
2194536 2198081 It saids to go to risky rock,<br />so she must be there.
2198123 2200793 But why risky rock?

2202252 2204337 Um... where is the girl?
2204379 2206965 It saids to go to risky rock,<br />so she must be there.
2207007 2209176 But why risky rock?
2209217 2210678 We should ask the girl.
2230488 2233241 Owe! What was that for?
2233283 2236286 You, sir, are sabotaging my relationship<br />with Red Shoes.
2236328 2238413 What "relationship" are you talking about?
2238455 2242417 Red Shoes and I share a secret.<br />I would tell you what it is.
2242459 2244294 But it's a secret.
2244336 2247464 Well, while you're busy keeping secrets,<br />I'm going to break my curse.
2247547 2249800 You're nothing without your spells, magic boy.
2249842 2253095 And you're nothing without Excalibur.
2253136 2257140 You're not waiting for someone<br />to pull it out for you, are you?
2257182 2258183 How did you know??
2258225 2259476 Is it true?
2274032 2276034 Hans, you shouldn't have!
2276076 2278829 Something sweet for someone sweeter.
2281123 2282666 This is, this is spectacular!
2282708 2285335 Awe, it's nothing.<br />Just let me know what you want,
2285377 2287838 anytime, for the rest of your life.
2287880 2288631 Do you like fondue?
2288672 2293969 Behold, carved by the finest jewelers out<br />of all the jewelers I know.
2294011 2295220 Which is a lot.
2296597 2297514 It's pretty.
2297556 2302019 And it's yours, Miss Shoes.<br />Yours, in exchange for nothing.
2302060 2302978 Maybe a kiss.
2303020 2306231 That's really sweet, Jack, but I can't accept it.
2306273 2309192 I don't want your jewels,<br />only your good intentions.
2309234 2312613 My intentions are more than good.<br />They're super-bon.
2312655 2313739 Testing, one two.
2313781 2316659 Testing. No I'm pushing that, you dolt.
2316700 2318702 Attention, hideous dwarfs!
2318744 2323498 Is it dwarfs, with a "F", or dwarves, with a "V"?<br />I want to use whatever's more offensive.
2323540 2325584 Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.
2325626 2328003 Heard that! It's "Ave-voo-RAHJ."
2328045 2329004 Oh, please.
2329046 2333091 Inside your amateurish attempt<br />at a facade of a sham of a travesty
2333133 2337429 of a veneer of a castle<br />is a gorgeous wanted criminal.
2337470 2341934 I hereby command that all of you exit the premises<br />and surrender post haste!
2341975 2346438 Fail to comply,<br />and you will never see these two again.
2346479 2348273 You have until three...
2348315 2348899 One...!
2351401 2352402 Two...!
2352444 2353779 I lied! Charge!
2374466 2376009 Am I the person you want?
2376051 2377845 Yes. Yes, you are.
2377886 2380430 Though I don't know if you're a person<br />or a vision of beauty,
2380472 2383809 some kind of angelic... thing with wings...
2383851 2385894 angelic wing thing.
2385936 2389314 I will come with you.<br />But only after you release my friends.
2389356 2390691 Do it. Do it!
2392735 2394236 Now. Here's the good news.
2394277 2398991 It's my birthday --<br />and you are going to be the belle of the ball.
2399074 2402828 The invitation sounds great, really. But...
2402870 2405163 It wasn't an invitation, more of an order.
2405205 2406081 Prepare the lady's carriage.
2406123 2408876 She said she doesn't wanna go, Average.
2408917 2413839 Ave-voo-rahj. Don't troll me, troll.
2413881 2415048 So rude!
2415132 2418468 I couldn't agree more!<br />Subjects these days. Now, shall we?
2427019 2427561 Get her!
2428395 2430230 You hold off the guards,<br />and I'll get her out of here.
2430272 2433150 No, I'm faster! You stay here and buy us time.
2441324 2444578 Here's a thought. Stop fighting...and fight!
2445996 2447080 What's the plan?
2448081 2449625 Let's rescue Red Shoes.
2449667 2451585 Like the old days, guys.

2680355 2681148 What?
2684902 2686111 You got to be kidding.
2686153 2688906 Finally, the big guns. Thank you!

2709051 2712304 OK Time out, time out! Everyone time out!
2712345 2715766 You almost blew her up.<br />And she can't come to my party if you blow her up!
2715808 2717059 Sorry sir...
2717100 2718393 All right, time back in.
2719645 2720688 Surrender, monsters!

2767025 2767484 WHAAAA!
2779788 2782165 You messed with the wrong prince!
2782207 2785002 There's nothing Average about Ave- voo-RAHJ!
2785043 2788546 I shall return!
2788589 2789464 On Tuesday.
2789506 2792843 No, wait, let me check my calendar... Thursday.
2792885 2796179 I shall return Thursday!
2797556 2798557 We'll be ready!
2798599 2799516 And waiting!
2799558 2800684 Arrivederci!
2800726 2801644 Chow for now!
2801685 2802603 Bye, bye!
2802645 2806148 You just got dwarfed! Is that better?<br />I think Merlin'd is better.
2822665 2826877 You should have seen the look on his big,<br />ugly face when Bunny came running at him.
2828003 2830422 That's how you see everything, isn't it?
2830463 2831799 With my eyes?
2831840 2834552 You always talk about what someone looks like.
2834593 2835844 I do?
2835886 2840057 I wouldn't say that.<br />But I can't wait for you to see the real me.
2840098 2842142 What kind of Merlin is the real you?
2842184 2843769 You might not believe it,
2843811 2847565 but the real me is famous, handsome<br />and even popular.
2847606 2850818 Not short, stumpy and green.
2850859 2856699 Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green.<br />But you're also a wonderful and charming person.
2856740 2862037 I'm not explaining it right. If you saw the real me,<br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
2862830 2864832 I think I can see the real you.
2865332 2868001 And I like you, just as you are.
2870754 2871964 That's hilarious.
2872005 2876384 Here - close your eyes, and imagine the real me.
2876468 2878679 I guarantee you it'll be different.
2880347 2884351 I do feel something different.
2884392 2885352 -- Really?
2885393 2890315 But eyes opened or closed,<br />to me you're still Merlin.
2891817 2896780 Now tell me, who am I to you?
2896822 2903161 You're a gift.<br />A gift that'll transform me into someone amazing.
2903203 2905122 Just like you're amazing.
2913714 2916800 Actually, I want to show you something, too.
2921597 2922806 Do you need a hand?
2922848 2926810 Hold on! Nope. Stand back. I got this.
2926852 2930272 One, two...Okay, yeah. I need help.
2948373 2951710 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope.<br />Thank you though.
2957841 2960678 You know the weird thing is,<br />they're super comfortable.
2963346 2966642 No, I'm just saying, where were you<br />when the facade was falling?
2966684 2968811 I mean that was terrifying.
2970688 2971647 What are you doing here?
2973774 2975734 I've come for my shoes.
2975776 2980614 Well, I had them. I mean, I saw them.<br />But those, those dwarfs.
2980656 2982908 It's dwarves. With a "v." So you failed?
2983366 2985077 I did not fail.
2985118 2987580 I took a time-out.
2987621 2989665 Yeah, this is a calculated time- out,
2989707 2991875 I'm going to return on Thursday,<br />we all penciled it in.
2991917 2993085 Silence!
2993126 2994211 Have a bite.
2995253 2996797 For strength.
2997339 3001677 Apples. The most suspicious of fruits.
3001719 3004512 I don't have much time, Prince.
3004555 3008851 You could still have the best birthday ever.
3008892 3016900 But remember what's bad for me,<br />will be very bad for you.
3022823 3023616 She is gone...
3025158 3027494 Ah, what's the worst that could happen?
3031539 3032415 It's kinda sweet...
3048599 3049683 Don't move.
3049767 3050601 Okay.
3050643 3052645 Pino, Noki, Kio - show us what you got!
3052686 3053604 Okey-dokey!
3053646 3054396 Here we go!
3054479 3055606 Our pleasure!
3062696 3066491 Keep going, little to the left. right there.
3083133 3084802 Now that looks like a real home.
3084843 3087012 Yeah. I could get used to that.
3087054 3088263 Nu-uh. I cannot.
3092142 3095145 It's a perfect copy of my drawing! That's incredible!
3096479 3097690 Let me try.
3097731 3101401 Wow. This will definitely make it easier<br />to find your dad.
3101443 3103612 Unfortunately, this thing ain't flying.
3103654 3104613 It's grounded.
3104655 3105573 Why does it need to fly?
3105614 3108450 The posters are no good<br />if we can't distribute them fast.
3108491 3112705 Guys, thank you so much<br />for everything you're doing for me.
3136061 3137062 Hi~
3160586 3162087 Wow! look at that!
3172640 3173223 Wow.
3184401 3185653 opening doors!
3201376 3205338 You know, merlin?<br />I feel so lucky that I've meet you.
3205380 3207675 I feel the same way!
3207716 3210969 I feel like anything is possible!
3227277 3229321 Merlin! watch out!
3240415 3241792 Merlin.
3243627 3244712 Merlin.
3246088 3246504 Merlin!
3247339 3249007 everything OK?
3249549 3251552 Of course, sure!
3251594 3252845 Nothing to be embarrassed about.
3252886 3257099 So why are we even talking about<br />that when we should be going...
3257140 3258058 this direction.
3258100 3259184 Hey, wait!
3263021 3265899 So, about these magic shoes.
3265941 3267317 Are those still bothering you?
3267359 3269319 What kind of magic do those shoes have?
3269695 3272823 Well...How do I put this?
3272865 3276827 Merlin, I used to be strong. Really strong.
3276869 3279537 And, I was always proud of that.
3279622 3284752 But the shoes' magic, um,<br />it made me a little dainty.
3284793 3285543 Sorry to hear.
3285586 3289798 The shoes made me lose a little bit of weight.
3289840 3291216 Could be worse.
3291258 3295095 Ok, a lot of weight.
3295137 3296221 Ah.
3296263 3300308 Well, I know what it's like to look different<br />on the outside from what you feel on the inside.
3304897 3309026 Merlin, I'd like to do give you a token<br />of my appreciation.
3310527 3312613 Oh, here. Hand me one of your spells.
3312655 3313572 Why?
3313614 3316033 Oh come on, I'm not going to zap you.
3317159 3317993 Give me a sec.
3330714 3334301 There. Consider it your good luck charm.
3337888 3339890 Thank you.
3345688 3352069 Merlin, do you think we'd be happier<br />if we were our old selves again?
3352110 3355072 Yep. Yep, yep, definitely we would.
3355113 3363872 I don't know. I like how we are.<br />Right here, just, right now.
3363914 3367417 Even if I'm an ugly green monster?
3369002 3372590 I don't care about your height<br />or what color you are
3373506 3377219 that's the way you feel about me, right?
3377260 3380347 Yes, of course! I mean, duh.
3382099 3385352 I think we're both just trapped<br />under the same spell.
3402160 3408041 Wait. Keep your eyes closed.<br />Don't open them until I say.
3408083 3413505 When you open your eyes,<br />there will be a handsome man in front of you.
3413546 3417092 Someone worthy of you.<br />Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.
3418135 3419302 I think you're right.
3419344 3422264 Ready, and...
3422305 3424808 It's such a good day to break a curse.
3427895 3428395 Now!
3429479 3435527 Tada! You just got Merlin'd! Ha-ha!<br />What do you think?
3435569 3438781 Mission impossibly handsome, right?
3440574 3444077 It's okay. I know this is a lot to take in.
3444119 3447164 But you can let your happiness flag fly.
3447205 3450709 This. This. Is the real me.
3451794 3452878 Ha Ha it's stupid.
3452920 3459092 What? Wait a minute.<br />My hands are still green sausages.
3460093 3462888 No. I look the same.
3462930 3465182 Yes. Impossibly handsome.
3465223 3467685 This doesn't make sense.
3467726 3470688 You're the most beautiful woman in the world!<br />Why do I look the same?
3470729 3472815 What are you talking about, Merlin?
3472856 3474399 Do I need a longer kiss?
3474441 3475651 Two kisses?
3476610 3478528 Let's try again.
3478571 3481198 Um, you're not making any sense.
3490123 3490874 Hurry!
3493376 3494127 What is that?!
3494502 3496797 This kingdom has a serious monster problem!
3513063 3513731 You all right?
3513772 3515566 No, I'm not.
3524157 3524658 Thank you.
3524700 3525618 Pleasure my lady.
3526952 3527369 Whoa!
3528411 3529162 Watch out!
3546096 3547430 Ha ha. Yes!
3547681 3548140 What?
3555022 3557650 What do they want?! Besides smashing us?
3557691 3558316 I don't know!
3567492 3569286 The old me would have nailed that!
3577753 3579129 You just got Merlin'd!
3589848 3590473 Hurry!
3606406 3608075 Red, close your eyes.
3608116 3609785 Um, this is no time for kissing, Merlin!
3609827 3611912 Just trust me. Close your eyes.
3613121 3614748 Please! Close them!
3619461 3620838 That was too close.
3621714 3623215 Don't look at me.
3623256 3625383 You see that tree on the other side of the bridge?
3625425 3625884 Yeah.
3625926 3629054 On my signal, run towards it as fast as you can.
3629096 3630472 No, I can't leave you here!
3630513 3633767 You have to. And don't look back, okay?
3633851 3636394 Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.
3636436 3638105 Promise you won't look.
3638146 3640608 Um, okay. I promise.
3641191 3641692 Now!
3673766 3674850 What's that?
3674892 3677019 You just got Merlin'd! Yes you did.
3706214 3707800 Hey, block-head!
3708884 3710844 Hey block-head bear!
3710886 3713806 You're even more<br />of a block-head than Prince Average!
3716266 3718435 Ave-voo-rahj!
3719061 3720228 Prince Average?
3736369 3737996 You just got Merlin'd.
3741750 3743085 Take a look, Red Shoes.
3743586 3744169 Merlin!
3744252 3746546 I have triumphantly saved the day!
3747673 3748591 Merlin! No!
3751093 3751760 No!
3751802 3752385 Merlin!
3823331 3824792 Snow White?
3834552 3839222 Snow White?<br />The thief was Snow White this whole time?!
3839264 3842810 Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
3844603 3847022 You're going after her yourself?
3847064 3848857 What? Were you going to go?
3848899 3851694 I get it. I don't have legs.
3854780 3859910 So. Here I am. Well, the real me.
3861579 3863413 I bet you're disappointed, huh?
3863455 3867042 You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.<br />Red Shoes!
3867084 3870337 That's not my name. It's Snow White.
3870378 3873048 Princess Snow White? So your father is --
3873090 3875801 King White, yeah.
3875843 3882349 By the time I figured out his new wife Regina<br />was a witch, he'd already disappeared.
3882390 3888689 And the monsters who attacked us were sent<br />by my stepmother to get these shoes.
3890608 3893526 I guess being beautiful is really worth<br />that much to her...
3893569 3896780 Have you thought about just giving them back?
3897781 3899032 And give up their magic?
3900618 3904246 If I'd given up their magic you wouldn't have<br />helped me find my father, would you?
3905413 3906414 Would you?
3910418 3912545 I thought we were both under the same spell,
3914256 3917801 but I see now that, I was wrong.
3917843 3923431 Listen, I can't get into all the details,<br />but I'm under a curse too.
3923473 3925183 You still don't get it, Merlin.
3926727 3928896 I'm not talking about our curses,
3930063 3935527 Merlin, I'm talking about the kind<br />of spell you never want to break.
3984910 3986912 He likes you more than he likes me.
4019277 4022573 What would have happened if she had<br />taken off her shoes that day in the barn?
4022615 4023907 You think that's important?
4026660 4031582 I just wonder what I would have done<br />if I had seen the real Snow White.
4031624 4035586 Seriously?<br />It's still all about appearance for you.
4035628 4038296 No! Not exactly.
4039172 4042425 But I can't live looking like you<br />for the rest of my life!
4042467 4044469 Kind of proving my point, other me.
4044511 4046930 Alright, let's try this--
4046972 4049683 who do you like more, Snow White or Red Shoes?
4049767 4052019 Easy! It's Red Shoes.
4052060 4054730 Now, which of us do you think<br />Red Shoes likes more?
4054772 4056106 Easy! It's-- me,
4058108 4063864 wait, no, it's you?
4100233 4105823 You're a gift. A gift that'll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
4126844 4130763 Well, I know what it's like to look different<br />on the outside from what you feel on the inside.
4150658 4151577 look at that!
4156624 4159667 The shoes. You're wearing them?
4159710 4161253 I thought you left.
4161293 4163005 You should take them off again.
4168260 4169970 I can't.
4170012 4173223 Ugh, you just had to make things complicated.
4174016 4175808 Maybe this will help.
4175851 4178270 Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.
4178310 4179146 Where did you get that?
4179186 4182815 I want to help you, Snow White. Please.
4189782 4190490 Red Shoes?
4191323 4191949 Merlin?
4193200 4194201 Merlin??
4197289 4199416 What terrible timing you have.
4201669 4204504 Uggh, we're going to have to do this the hard way.
4205087 4206006 Regina?
4208466 4212971 Aw. Such a tender family reunion.
4213013 4214848 So sad we can't stay.
4215974 4217017 Red Shoes!
4219352 4221521 C'mon. Let's go, long ears!
4221564 4223106 Hey! Wait for us!
4223148 4225108 How about you go back and get the others.
4225150 4227277 And make lots of copies of this.
4227736 4228403 Let's go!
4231281 4232741 We can do this!
4235994 4238581 Your power, my lady, it has drained you.
4238622 4242375 You think? I don't need you tell me how I look.
4242417 4247923 I'm a mirror. It's what I do?<br />M-I-R- O-R. I can't spell.
4247965 4248423 Enough!
4250133 4254555 Bind her. It's snack time.
4258225 4260268 How can you sleep-eat at a time like this?
4262020 4264690 I'm not supposed to talk when I have this on,
4264732 4268068 but I gotta ask - do you think they've kissed yet?
4268110 4272239 I hope so. Because it'll feel better<br />to punch Merlin when he's pretty.
4273323 4276827 We've been waiting forever! Where have you --
4276869 4277786 Did you break the curse, yet?
4277828 4279580 Ah, Merlin - are you hungry?
4279622 4280372 Those are bears.
4280413 4286003 Uh, hi. This is from Merlin.
4302519 4304563 Wow. This is so cool.
4308692 4310277 Okay, sword.
4310318 4314907 If you think you've humiliated,<br />embarrassed and otherwise frustrated me...
4315532 4317409 You're right.
4317492 4321079 But that ends now!
4330714 4332758 Oh, please end this.
4344394 4348481 Hey! Wait! you are running the wrong way!
4348523 4349858 The castle is over there!
4365290 4367334 Uh, "sit."
4379262 4383350 Eat this, darling, and you'll get your freedom.
4383391 4384476 Where's my father?
4384517 4389648 Uggh. Royal, loyal little girl,<br />pining for her papa.
4389732 4394236 This is getting a little boring.<br />So I need you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.
4394277 4397322 I won't let you win. You've torn apart my family,
4397364 4399282 and you will not get away with it, Regina.
4400618 4403536 Ooh, so scared, Snow.
4403579 4406749 Very well. A different approach, then.
4415382 4416008 Merlin!
4417050 4418927 Eat the apple or watch him die.
4419011 4420095 That's your choice.
4420137 4426727 Red Shoes! Don't do it!
4426769 4429187 Promise to me you'll let him go.
4429229 4432440 Oh absolutely. When the third bell chimes,
4432482 4435360 everything will be just like it used to be.
4435443 4437362 Red Shoes, don't do it! No!
4440240 4441366 Save my papa for me.
4468811 4473273 The Legendary handsome Merlin,<br />fearless rescuer of princesses...
4473315 4481448 ...sitting in a tree. Not getting K-I-S-I-N-G'd!<br />Burn! I can't spell.
4483617 4487079 You don't have to do this.<br />Just take the shoes and let us go!
4487120 4490583 Ugh, I wish! They're made of pure magic apple --
4490624 4493836 the fruit of temptation and want.<br />They feed on your desires.
4493919 4498173 And once they give you what you desire,<br />the bond is permanent.
4498215 4500508 That's not true. She took them off in the river.
4500551 4502553 That doesn't make any sense.
4502595 4507057 How could she possibly want to save you<br />more than she wanted to be beautiful?
4507099 4509309 What did you do to her?
4509351 4511478 Did you cast a spell?
4513480 4515315 What's going to happen to her?
4515357 4520237 Well, once she eats the apple,<br />its magic will turn her into a magic apple tree.
4520278 4523240 Gong! First bell sounds. Very dramatic.
4523281 4526034 The tree bears fruit at the second bell.
4526076 4530581 Gong! Excitement mounts!<br />The morning sun touches the fruit,
4530623 4533041 turning it into a new pair of red shoes.
4533083 4536003 Gong number three! The circle of life!
4536044 4537420 And then what?
4537462 4542384 Regina will be the most beautiful person<br />in the kingdom. Forever.
4542425 4545137 I don't care about her! What about Snow White?
4545220 4549683 The tree withers and dies. And so does Snow White.
4549725 4551476 No!
4551518 4557900 Yas! Oh! I'm rotting! I'm dying.
4574708 4577586 Why don't you come back and play.
4584009 4585343 Not so fast.
4594728 4595896 It's gonna hurt.
4599567 4602527 Oh yeah! Stretch it out.
4614247 4615040 Uh oh.
4620003 4621088 Smoke! Smoke!
4621171 4623465 We're here, mate. Are you OK?
4623506 4625008 Yeah
4625050 4630305 I never thought I'd say this,<br />but I'm so glad to be chubby and green again.
4631181 4635603 Seven to one, I like those odds. Let's go.
4637730 4639690 We like those odds even better.
4642359 4643944 Are you up to this, muchacho?
4643986 4647656 Wow. You finally pulled out Excalibur!
4647698 4652035 Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, I did it,<br />that's exactly how it went down.
4652119 4654204 Here you go, Merlin, you're gonna need these.
4654246 4655664 Thanks.
4661128 4663130 Here comes the sun.
4663672 4665548 Now let's all get dwarfed!
4669887 4674057 This is where your fairy tale ends, trolls!
4678562 4679521 You missed.
4716642 4718268 Au revoir, mirror!
4733408 4734534 Finally..!
4743293 4745545 It's a good day to break a curse!
4747715 4749424 ...Eternal beauty!
4763271 4765733 I'm sorry, Snow White.
4768694 4772405 Noo!
4798932 4801935 Extraordinary no more carrots for me.
4807524 4808441 Woah!
4808483 4809526 We're back!
4809568 4810360 Yippee!
4820746 4821329 Papa!
4831840 4833258 Snow White!
4835510 4836929 Oh, Papa!
4836970 4837638 Snow!
4842976 4843393 Wait.
4844269 4845604 Where's Merlin?
4845646 4847522 I'm so sorry.
4847565 4851526 He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
4852235 4853571 Merlin, no!
4856865 4858325 Merlin!
4918927 4920262 I thought you were gone.
4921639 4925643 You're the most beautiful woman in the world.
4927770 4932858 Whether my eyes are open or closed.
4944452 4945245 No...
4962930 4964181 I got Merlin'd.
4989915 4991499 You're Prince Merlin.
4999257 5005388 Yeah. That Merlin.<br />The one who's not really your type.
5009017 5011144 I kinda liked the short and green Merlin.
5014106 5016191 But I'm still that Merlin inside.
5017525 5020320 Yes. Yes you are.
5027828 5028787 Yay!
5028829 5030372 Yes!
5030413 5032625 Hooray!
5032750 5033375 Nice!
5038672 5040507 Any idea who that girl is?
5186654 5187362 Not again.
