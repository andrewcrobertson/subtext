24450 27600 This, is Fairy Tale Island.
27930 31180 A magical land of princes and princesses
31680 33380 witches and monsters.
34310 38730 Accidents and strange events<br />happen all the time.
38900 41280 And that's when people call us.
41650 46360 The Fearless Seven, the greatest<br />heroes on Fairy Tale Island.
46400 48700 Especially me, Merlin.
49400 53330 But everything changed<br />the day we defeated a dragon
53540 55250 and saved a Princess.
56920 61050 We thought we'd saved a witch,<br />so, we attacked her.
61510 64260 But we were wrong.
64670 68220 She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.
68260 70600 The Fairy Princess!
70930 73530 How were we supposed to know?<br />She looks like a witch,
73530 76630 and everyone knows that a<br />princess doesn't look like a witch.
77690 82230 Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,<br />so she put a curse on us.
82430 84400 And this was a nasty one.
84570 88990 that turned us into little ugly green<br />monsters whenever people looked at us.
89400 91280 And the only way to break the curse
91330 95330 is to get a kiss from the<br />most beautiful woman in the world.
95870 97670 Are you kidding me?
97750 99410 With this face?
146670 148260 Hello, your majesty.
148380 151140 - Good morning ma'am.<br />- Good morning ma'am.
155060 159020 Magic tree, magic tree...
159270 165110 Let this morning be the time<br />that you perform your duty,
170400 178400 of bringing me the shoes<br />of youthful eternal... beauty.
186670 187670 Yes!
188970 190680 Change me!
193050 194510 Finally!
199420 201560 Not again! How long must I wait?
201690 203400 - No. - Clear these away.
203400 204190 Uh-oh.
204190 204400 Heads off.<br />Uh-oh.
204400 204980 Heads off.
205150 206730 Pull yourself together.
210530 211570 Here you are.
212400 214530 Oh? Thanks!
237970 241230 That wasn't here before.<br />What is she up to now?
261030 262030 Huh?
282770 283770 Huh?
287610 289110 You weren't here before.
293740 294740 Whatever.
299370 300700 Oh! Oww!
304870 305870 Yes!
309000 313410 I can't believe my beloved daughter<br />Snow White has turned eighteen.
313590 319300 I only wish her mother could see the kind of<br />smart and beautiful young woman she's become.
319890 322770 Strange thing happened during the party.
322970 326690 The castle guards brought in<br />a woman named Regina.
326900 332690 They said she was a witch,<br />but she was too beautiful to be a witch.
332780 337240 I have married Regina.<br />Everything feels so perfect!
337820 344250 Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.<br />There's something not quite right.
344870 349130 People around the castle have been<br />disappearing, one by one.
349290 351920 Is it because of that peculiar mirror?
352000 356970 I saw it with my own eyes,<br />Regina talking to a tree.
357010 359340 She must be a witch!
359840 363690 I should send Snow away to a safer place.
363720 368940 My dear Snow, by the time you read this,<br />my fate will be uncertain.
369270 371110 She's coming for me now.
371230 375900 I only hope you can find the<br />Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.
377570 378660 Apples...
378740 381780 ... the most suspicious of fruits.
383400 384400 Oh,
384400 387500 Papa, where are you?
391210 392790 But they don't look dangerous.
409980 410620 Regina?
410650 413820 No, my shoes! Get her!
423160 424500 - Can I borrow this?<br />- Okay.
424530 425530 Thanks!
439970 441130 What?
442420 444800 Nooo!!!!!
452350 454940 Short, chubby, and green.
456190 457820 Green is like an ogre.
457860 461070 Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.<br />And cuddly.
461400 463950 Quit your complaining, Merlin!
464070 467790 I'm figuring out how to take this curse<br />and kick it where the sun don't shine.
467990 472410 Listen, we need to find the most<br />beautifullest princess to kiss us,
472540 474440 and we've just about run out of options.
474960 479510 How would a beautiful woman<br />even see you, Mister Invisible?
482340 484510 - What was that?<br />- Some kind of bird?
489270 492190 Magic mirror, full of wisdom,
492310 495360 who's the fairest in the Kingdom?
495690 498610 The woman who wears the red shoes.
500690 503580 And side note, wisdom and<br />kingdom don't really rhyme.
503610 507370 Cut the sass and tell me her name!
508370 510240 How should I know?<br />I don't get out much.
510330 512580 Well, you are the magic mirror.
512750 517260 Magic is just my first name,<br />it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.
517290 519710 What can you do then?
519880 524300 I just reflect what I see,<br />the truth. The truth is,
524380 529220 that you should see yourself right now.<br />Right now!
530640 531720 Watch it.
532350 537400 Distribute wanted posters to every town,<br />village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,
537520 539230 and find her!
541030 542740 I feel my power draining.
542860 546700 I don't have much time.<br />The aging is accelerating.
546990 550120 And only three bumbling<br />bits of kindling for help.
550240 554330 Perhaps you should recruit another, someone<br />who stands to gain from your success.
554370 556370 What about this fellow?
557210 559410 Interesting.
559920 564050 Tell me more, Magichard.
565090 567230 Hey hey, Over here! Over here!
567260 568760 See, see. Come! Very quick.
568800 570260 Look at this. Look, look, look.
571390 572390 What is it?
576940 579110 I know a lot about silhouettes,
579310 581490 and I think this shape is a witch.
581520 584940 Let's not jump to conclusions.<br />Yes, it could be a witch.
585030 585900 ...Or
586030 586900 Ya. It's a witch
587030 588990 The witch who cursed us?
589070 591080 Let's catch her and make<br />her break the spell!
609970 610400 En garde!
610420 612350 Wands where I can see 'em, witch!
621350 622350 Fraulein!
622360 623400 No No No! Stop!
623430 625740 I get you some revenge!
629610 630700 Beautiful!
631030 633870 I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.
633950 635500 How did she end up with us?
642920 646730 Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my<br />home slash command post.
646760 649380 I have six room mates<br />but my name's on the lease.
649420 650840 I pay the rent.
651050 655450 Your home? Oh my gosh,<br />I am... I am so sorry.
655600 657360 I was starving and...
657390 659390 No need to apologize.
659640 662280 We didn't mean to interrupt<br />your stolen meal.
662310 665500 If you're still hungry,<br />I can whip up something simple.
665530 667620 - You see I, marinate the solution and...
667650 668780 Who is that?
670100 671100 Uhh...
671110 672370 Who?
679160 682330 Wow. I look so different.
682670 685380 I mean, my face, and my waist,<br />and my waist and...
685410 686500 My waist?
687130 690130 Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
695180 699680 Oh, I must've gotten up so<br />quickly my back is killing me.
700600 702430 You mean your head, right?
702980 706400 - Do you need help?<br />- No, I'm fine.
709990 714200 Is that really what I look like?<br />In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?
714370 716030 You're beautiful, miss.
716160 717740 Like an angel!
717910 718910 Really?
720040 721210 Could it be?
721400 723340 Excuse me, but who are you?
723370 724880 Oh... I'm Snow...
725130 726000 Snot?
726090 727630 No no no no no no.
729090 730920 My name is...
731720 733090 R-Red Shoes.
734510 737390 Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.
737450 742020 Cool name, but, by any chance<br />would that be Princess Red Shoes?
742060 743820 Of course, she's a princess!
743850 746830 How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?
746860 748770 Obviously! Right, miss?
748860 751820 Obviously, I mean I am a princess.
752950 754320 Who are you guys?
754360 756440 I'm Merlin.
756530 759010 Part time hero, full time romantic.
759870 763130 And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,<br />Pino, Noki and Kio.
763160 766750 No way, your names are<br />the same as the F-Seven.
766880 769600 The Fearless Seven.<br />I'm looking for them.
769630 772410 Let me guess,<br />Merlin's your favourite?
773300 775420 No, not really.
775450 777640 No, that Merlin's not your type.
777720 780640 You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
780770 784310 Honestly, none of them are<br />really my type.
786050 787050 Oh.
787060 788980 Well. That's fine.
789150 792400 Because we're not them, we're<br />actually completely different people.
792430 797210 In no way are we the same guys, put under<br />a curse, and changed into different forms.
797240 800410 But only if someone looks at us,<br />It's very complicated.
800440 801480 Right. We're all clear.
802540 805210 So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
805500 807210 I need to find my father,
807330 809210 and I know that the F-Seven can help.
809880 814220 We know the F-Seven very well,<br />and their schedule is fully booked.
814380 817220 Leave it to me,<br />I'll find your father within the month.
817260 818860 I can do it in one week.
818890 820610 - Four days! - Three days!
820640 821930 - Two days! - One!
822010 822900 Oomph!
822930 825140 I already found your<br />father like, two weeks ago.
825230 826310 Really?
826390 829370 I just need a few days<br />to get him across state lines.
829400 831400 I seriously need to find my dad.
831430 835860 Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven<br />in over a year, right?
835990 839320 You're not going to find them now,<br />we're your best bet.
840700 844080 Wow. No-ones offered to<br />help me for such a long time.
845080 846220 You guys are awesome
846250 849580 Really? You think we are awesome?
849630 854930 Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...
854960 857800 And not completely hideous to look at?
857970 861180 No, you guys are totally adorable.
861220 863100 I think I hit her too hard.
863140 866020 But she is beautiful.
867180 869650 She can help me break the curse.
874650 877900 Who is coming to my birthday party?
877990 879880 Has Ariel RSVP'd?
879910 882590 She says she can't make it, sir.<br />She has to wax her legs.
882620 883910 But she's a mermaid!
883990 885130 What about Sleeping Beauty?
885160 886380 Doctor's appointment.
886400 888550 - Is she sick?<br />- Says she has insomnia.
888580 890850 If she's not gonna sleep,<br />she can come to our party.
890880 891890 What about Rapunzel?
891920 895060 And don't tell me she's<br />getting her hair done.
895090 898300 Nope. It's something called, uh, book.
898380 899350 Princess Cruise?
899380 900520 That's a ship, sir.
900550 901230 Princess Leia?
901260 902430 She's a general!
902450 905180 I demand glorious guests!
905390 908650 How can I be any more unpopular!
908680 911350 And I don't understand, why?
913860 916660 Greetings, Prince Average.
916690 919240 It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.
919360 920740 Sure it is.
921030 924630 If you're here for the 'We Love<br />Our Peasants' group giveaway,
924660 927540 that motion is ended.<br />Grab your wrinkles and go.
927700 928700 Move along.
932960 936560 Do you think that people would respect you,
936590 943450 if you celebrated your birthday with<br />a beautiful woman on your arm?
943760 946940 Finally, someone talking sense!
946970 948820 This horrible crone gets it!
948850 951520 May I suggest inviting
951890 954110 this young lady?
955190 957950 She's beautiful, when can she get here?
957980 959820 Well, that's up to you.
959940 963530 You see, she's stolen something from me.
963740 969620 You find her, bring her along with you,<br />and you won't look like such a loser,
969790 972920 and I get my shoes back.
973080 975100 Fear not, loyal hag.
975130 977250 I, Prince Average,
977380 981260 shall find this fugitive,<br />and make her pay for her crimes,
981380 983420 by making her attend my birthday party.
984550 986970 There shall be balloons!
987050 990450 I just thought of it.<br />Let's have a lot of balloons!
990770 992640 What a buffoon.
1001240 1003200 It looks just like papa.
1009030 1010620 Papa won't recognise me.
1016540 1020960 Why won't... why won't these<br />shoes just come off?
1027600 1030310 Yes, this is me.
1038610 1042280 Would you like to join me<br />in a moisturising mask?
1042430 1045400 Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...
1046310 1047310 Oh!
1047320 1048370 So tired.
1048400 1049700 Are you sure?
1049870 1052670 It's very important to take<br />care of your skin.
1052700 1053700 Positive.
1055830 1059210 But this is the finest French<br />recipe meant to hydrate skin.
1059630 1061920 It is made of French poopee!
1063260 1064260 Papa?
1065410 1069760 Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.
1070050 1071510 Oh, there it is.
1071850 1074140 Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?
1074180 1076390 Have you checked in the kitchen?
1076560 1079940 Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!
1082430 1084360 Now, where was I?
1085150 1087400 Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?
1088990 1090380 - It's nowhere to be... - No!
1090400 1093590 Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.<br />Now please, go away.
1093620 1095700 Someone's got anger management issues.
1099790 1102380 Getting a kiss was never<br />a problem with this face.
1105210 1106220 Red Shoes?
1108260 1109590 Papa?
1110260 1112010 Papa? Are you there?
1112930 1113970 Papa?
1136910 1141210 Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are<br />the way to a woman's heart.
1143540 1146730 It works! I call it, an auto portrait.
1146760 1148390 I call it, the duplicatertron.
1148410 1149900 I call it, selfie!
1149930 1151610 Red Shoes must love it!
1151640 1153110 Monsieur, monsieur.
1153140 1155810 She doesn't want sweets and selfies.
1155970 1158310 Women want diamonds.
1158560 1159560 Merlin?
1165820 1169610 The Book of Spells To Make You Fall In Love?
1173740 1177410 Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.
1177440 1178910 You're a nice bunny.
1179710 1181920 You're a Vegan bunny, right?
1185500 1187880 What was that? Lightning?
1188010 1190510 Actually, it's called magic. I do it.
1190550 1192800 Really? Then do some!
1193840 1195550 ¶ Darling...
1196970 1200600 ¶ Wish you could see what can I see
1201140 1204900 ¶ Miles ahead just you and me
1205270 1208280 ¶ To infinity
1213530 1216370 Keep running, and whatever<br />you do, don't look back.
1216400 1217700 But I can't leave without you.
1217950 1220200 You're looking back. Don't do that.
1220440 1221440 But...
1222160 1224040 Hate to zap you longears,
1224250 1226710 But I need to impress a beautiful woman.
1226880 1229060 Big, scary bunny! Over here!
1229090 1231090 Red! Stop putting yourself in...
1233300 1234970 ...danger...
1254740 1256440 Arthur! I got you.
1256700 1259170 It's no use, Red Shoes.
1259200 1262880 I'm slippin' away. Not much time...
1262910 1266050 Just... need to... use that core of mine...
1266080 1268590 I see the light at the end of the funnel.
1268840 1272310 Time for me to kick the bucket
1272340 1274350 I had a good run. I was God blessed.
1274380 1278390 Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!
1278600 1281780 Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
1281810 1284850 Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.
1285100 1287830 Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.
1287860 1290120 And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.
1290150 1292400 No, No, No. I'm fine, but Arthur, he's stuck.
1292430 1293910 He tried to save me and...
1293940 1295400 Would you get up?
1295820 1297440 What? He's not hurt?
1297610 1300030 - Only his pride.<br />- Seriously Arthur?
1300160 1302580 You need to find a better<br />way to hit on girls.
1311920 1314800 Stand back! I may have to risk my life.
1324100 1325980 Someone call for three inventors?
1326140 1327600 For three geniuses?
1328190 1329690 That sounds like us!
1330940 1334400 Everyone came runnin' to help,<br />great, just great.
1334430 1336170 Everyone except Merlin, that is.
1336200 1338400 Ah! Super, there he is now.
1339030 1339920 Where have you been?
1339950 1342710 Something awful could've happened<br />to Red if I hadn't shown up.
1342740 1343830 You?
1344580 1346790 Don't even go there!
1347160 1349330 I saved her first.
1350440 1352380 - Right?<br />- I was worried about you.
1352500 1354440 I was worried about me too.
1354760 1357600 - But mostly you.<br />- No-one needs to worry.
1357630 1359890 Arthur's here. Please, my lady.
1360010 1361300 Um... Okay.
1370560 1372650 You shouldn't go into the<br />forest by yourself.
1372860 1377900 It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for<br />bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
1378320 1379440 ...And squirrels.
1379610 1381320 I thought I saw my father.
1381990 1384740 Turned out, just to be that big bunny.
1384910 1388910 Well, if you ever make such a dangerous<br />and weird mistake again,
1389080 1391250 just know that I can protect you.
1391750 1393060 This's very kind.
1393090 1397710 And if you really want to express<br />your gratitude, you can...
1399510 1401980 Oh, I am so sorry.
1402010 1407310 This was much slappier than<br />I intended it to be.
1407680 1410100 Oh! It happens. No problem.
1410810 1413060 Maybe an apology kiss then?
1415690 1417110 Bravo mon ami!
1417610 1418990 Nice try.
1419650 1421200 Red Shoes.
1425950 1429440 Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going<br />to have to work as a tightly knit team.
1429540 1431440 Which means, you do everything I say.
1431540 1433100 - Excuse? - Huh? - What? - No.
1433130 1433890 You got to be kidding.
1433920 1436170 Hans and Jack will search around the Dismal Lake.
1436250 1439130 Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.
1439260 1442300 Red Shoe and I, will go to Golden Goose Avenue.
1442420 1447100 Golden Goose Avenue, which happens<br />to be your go to place for dates.
1447220 1449450 We are going to focus on the mission.
1449600 1451890 And then see where the evening takes us.
1452190 1456360 The only thing you're going to shop for<br />on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.
1456400 1458070 And you can't even afford that.
1458230 1460830 I like my odds. You saw what she did.
1460860 1463200 An expression of affection.
1463360 1465200 Every woman shows it differently.
1465320 1466840 You took your shot. You got slapped.
1466870 1467920 May I remind you
1467950 1471830 that this is the closest thing to a<br />kiss anyone's had since the curse.
1472920 1476510 Let's work together to guide<br />Red Shoes' feelings towards me
1476540 1478390 so we can break the curse.
1478410 1479710 What about the rest of us?
1479760 1482260 After I resume my princely form,
1482410 1484890 the word about F-Seven will be out.
1484930 1488680 Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.
1488760 1490560 - Really?<br />- Sounds reasonable.
1490640 1492150 I'll bring the gelato!
1492180 1494770 Getting one kiss sure is easier<br />than getting seven.
1494850 1497740 This is not a plan,<br />he's just out for himself!
1497770 1499790 A half baked plan is better than none.
1499820 1503400 Don't worry Merlin,<br />I have a big assignment for you.
1504070 1505660 Big assignment?
1505990 1508160 Here you go. I drew these up last night.
1508530 1511910 I can't tell if this drawing is terrible, or
1512540 1514250 really avant garde.
1514370 1516580 Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.
1516750 1518140 Pablo Picassover?
1518170 1521960 One thing's for sure,<br />daddy's on the big side...
1522550 1524130 ...of big.
1525300 1526720 You must take after your mother.
1526930 1528180 No, I look a lot like papa...Oh!
1529180 1535430 Yeah, my mother. Gosh! We... exactly! Twins!
1536270 1539120 Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.
1539150 1541940 Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!
1544400 1545900 And where d'ya think you're going?
1546240 1547950 Your post is right there.
1548030 1550620 You'll watch the savage monster.<br />I call him Vicious!
1550660 1552200 I call him Woodbottom.
1552290 1554730 Do not worry Merlin. We'll make<br />sure you get kissed too.
1554960 1556160 Eventually.
1557750 1558970 We'll split up here.
1559000 1560750 Alright, see you later.
1561630 1564590 I know exactly where we should<br />look to find your father.
1564840 1566340 Really? Where?
1574390 1575520 Daddy!
1575800 1576800 Wow!
1577810 1578990 Is this what I think it is?
1579020 1585070 I present Excalibur, the legendary<br />sword trapped in this rock for centuries.
1585430 1588830 Waiting for a man of great<br />strength to release it.
1588860 1592120 It says 'Do not attempt to remove by force'.
1592200 1594700 ... Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.
1595040 1601130 The truth is, I realized you were the woman<br />of my destiny the first time I saw you.
1601440 1604170 I thought if I could show you my strength
1604410 1606630 I would be worthy of your affections.
1610540 1611540 Oh!
1612050 1614030 Oops, I'll put it back.
1614060 1615720 No No No! Can I have it?
1626110 1629280 Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.
1629610 1631870 You want me to, maybe pull<br />it out for you again?
1632120 1634370 No, I'm not humiliated at all.
1635160 1636200 Let's go.
1645800 1649550 Don't look at me like that,<br />I'm the real prisoner here.
1649800 1651890 What? You hungry?
1653350 1654930 And fetch!
1662900 1664650 Hop along, big guy!
1664860 1667610 There's no way Arthur is<br />breaking this curse alone!
1684580 1685670 Woah!
1687440 1689210 Arthur, where're you going?
1692450 1693450 Okay.
1694050 1695180 See you later.
1696350 1697350 Hi.
1698270 1700180 Oh, look at what you made me do!
1700270 1701310 You...
1701520 1702730 I'm sorry.
1702940 1704940 ...made me make it perfect.
1705400 1706400 Thank you.
1706900 1707900 Woah!
1708980 1710790 I'm so sorry.
1710820 1713740 No, don't be. I am sorry.
1714070 1715400 Are you alright?
1715520 1716520 And...
1716530 1718330 ...don't worry about this.
1721580 1722250 What?
1722440 1723830 Ta-da!
1726250 1728560 Excuse me, have you seen this man?
1728590 1731090 ¶ I'm feeling good today
1731840 1735090 ¶ And nothing standing in my way
1735260 1737450 ¶ I wouldn't change a thing
1737720 1741310 ¶ I must have been walking in a dream
1741600 1744520 ¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare
1744810 1747860 ¶ People talk but I don't care
1748020 1751190 ¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare
1751280 1754280 ¶ People talk but I don't care
1754400 1757400 ¶ Don't matter what you think or see
1757420 1759920 ¶ There's no-one I would rather be
1760330 1763370 ¶ Take me as I am this is me
1763540 1766750 ¶ There's no-one I would rather be
1767240 1768540 ¶ It don't matter
1769250 1771670 ¶ It don't matter to me
1772460 1774260 ¶ It dont matter
1774840 1777890 ¶ Take me as I am this is me
1791110 1793910 Arthur, I was thinking.
1793940 1796670 What if I just pull out the Excalibur for you?
1796700 1798200 Our secret.
1798950 1801130 Really? We have a secret now?
1801160 1801760 Yeah.
1801790 1804410 I like a girl who can keep things classified.
1804440 1806710 Let's find your pops, friend.
1806920 1807920 'Bye guys.
1812000 1813000 What?
1814380 1816340 Hey, you.
1816720 1817840 No.
1819050 1820050 Hey!
1820680 1821680 Stop!
1827600 1828600 Come on!
1855960 1858170 Oh, you guys don't have to help.
1858300 1860400 That's not her. Come on.
1860420 1861450 Sorry miss.
1865220 1867900 Red Shoes! Where has she gone?
1867930 1869700 Where's Red Shoes?
1869730 1871400 That's what I'd like to know.
1871900 1873190 Wait a minute.
1873320 1874870 Who said you could leave your post?
1874900 1876940 I'm just walking the bunny.
1879400 1881780 Red Shoes, where are you?
1881950 1884160 Hey, have you seen this girl?
1889830 1891050 Look what I found
1891080 1894380 Oh, those're mine.<br />Can I, actually have my shoes back?
1897210 1899520 No way. You're not serious, are you?
1899550 1903300 I'm really not in the mood,<br />Can you just, please give them back to me?
1904140 1905820 Ha! They won't even fit on you.
1905850 1907940 They're gonna fit me better<br />than they fit you.
1907970 1908970 Hey!
1909980 1911060 Red Shoes!
1911190 1912980 Guys! Guys, I'm here.
1916570 1919650 - Red Shoes!<br />- Red Shoes! Where are you?
1920950 1923570 Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.
1926120 1928870 Those dwarfs are not hideous.
1929000 1931620 And I don't need anyone to help me.
1933630 1935510 Freeze! Put the shoes down.
1935540 1938100 Get on your knees and put<br />your hands behind your head.
1938130 1939930 On second thought, they're yours.
1939960 1943090 There's no need to push me in a corner
1943300 1945180 Super scary.
1955810 1957610 Your red shoes, milady.
1958400 1959400 Thank you.
1959610 1962280 Excuse me, miss, have we met?
1963660 1966120 Well, that's kind of a complicated question.
1966240 1967620 Red Shoes!
1968240 1970790 Gotta go. Be safe.
1991020 1992020 Guys!
1994560 1996150 Where has she gone?
1997310 1998570 Red Shoes!
1998980 1999980 Stop!
2002860 2003860 Hold on!
2007440 2008440 Wait a minute.
2009620 2011790 Gotcha now, don't we?
2012700 2013710 I don't get it.
2017290 2019840 Now we know how fast a<br />bunny can hop in a pinch.
2020090 2021630 Thank you for helping me, Merlin.
2021800 2023210 A pleasure, milady.
2023630 2025720 But I also did it for us.
2026550 2029140 By the way, what is this?
2030260 2032220 Gosh, it seems silly but...
2032890 2034350 ... It's my shoes
2035310 2037770 - They're magical.<br />- I know, they're fabulous.
2037900 2039370 But why're they after you?
2039400 2043710 No, my shoes, they're actually made of magic.
2043740 2045070 Red Shoes!
2045360 2046400 Are you a criminal?
2046740 2048530 No, of course not.
2049160 2052370 I knew a girl this pretty couldn't<br />possibly be a criminal.
2052580 2055910 Look, we should head out now,<br />there could be more guards around any minute.
2056160 2059040 Don't worry about them,<br />I've got these bad boys.
2059410 2062340 This is gonna make it so much<br />harder to find my dad.
2066300 2067340 I have an idea!
2070010 2074420 ¶ What a sight what I feel<br />when I'm looking at you
2074560 2078390 ¶ Like I see in the sky for<br />the very first time
2078430 2085570 ¶ And I want you to know that I've<br />never seen something so beautiful
2086950 2091620 ¶ In the stars it's a sign that<br />our worlds could collide
2092200 2095400 ¶ You and I, side by side
2095540 2102540 ¶ And I want you to know that I've<br />never seen something so beautiful
2103090 2104300 Ta-da!
2105050 2107170 Oh wow!
2111720 2112720 What do you think?
2113180 2115890 That is amazing.
2117420 2118230 Thank you.
2118310 2123020 ¶ This is the start of something so right
2123230 2128030 ¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned
2128400 2131910 ¶ In the right place at the right time
2135240 2138260 You had a thing on your cheek.
2138290 2139370 Alright, let's go.
2159180 2162600 - We've been walking for hours.<br />- And we'll keep walking 'till we find them.
2169400 2171150 Now we got her.
2172660 2175030 - Are they gone?<br />- Shh. Who cares? -
2175240 2176740 C'mon. Let's go see.
2177700 2178790 Look at that.
2179780 2180780 - Wow!<br />- Wow!
2180790 2181830 Awsome!
2181960 2182890 Who's that?
2182920 2184290 It's the girl's father.
2184440 2185750 But where's the girl?
2185920 2188920 It says to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2189410 2190800 Why Risky Rock?
2190920 2192150 We should ask the girl.
2192180 2194550 Perfect! Where's the girl?
2194800 2198140 It says to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2198450 2200730 But, why Risky Rock?
2200890 2202130 We should ask the girl.
2202130 2202270 Umm...<br />We should ask the girl.
2202270 2203130 Umm...
2203140 2204320 Where's the girl?
2204350 2206950 It says to go to Risky Rock,<br />so she must be there.
2206980 2209230 But, why Risky Rock?
2209430 2210650 We should ask the girl.
2221980 2226580 ¶ This is the start of something so right
2226580 2230580 ¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned
2230680 2231480 Oww!
2232090 2233220 What was that for?
2233260 2236270 You, sir, are sabotaging my<br />relationship with Red Shoes.
2236300 2238570 What relationship are<br />you talking about?
2238600 2241150 Red Shoes and I share a secret.
2241180 2244140 I would tell you what it is,<br />but it's a secret.
2244270 2247690 While you're busy keeping secrets,<br />I'm going to break my curse.
2247770 2249990 You're nothing without<br />your spells, magic boy.
2250020 2252530 And you're nothing without Excalibur.
2253280 2257130 You're not waiting for someone to<br />pull it out for you, are you?
2257160 2258200 How did you know?
2258320 2259400 Is it true?
2274510 2276090 Hans, you shouldn't have.
2276220 2279050 Something sweet, for someone sweeter.
2281310 2282650 This is spectacular!
2282680 2285390 Oh, it's nothing.<br />Just let me know what you want.
2285410 2288730 Any time, for the rest of your life.<br />Do you like fondue?
2288770 2293990 Behold! Carved by the finest jewellers<br />out of all the jewellers I know
2294280 2295530 which is a lot.
2296900 2297370 Pretty.
2297400 2301990 And it's yours, Miss Shoes,<br />yours in exchange for nothing.
2302080 2302990 Make it a kiss.
2303080 2306120 That's really sweet Jack,<br />but I can't accept it.
2306370 2309180 I don't want your jewells,<br />only your good intentions.
2309210 2312630 My intentions are more than good,<br />they're super bonne.
2312710 2313800 Testing one, two.
2313880 2316630 Testing one... no, I'm pushing it, you dolt.
2316670 2318860 Attention! Hideous trolls!
2318890 2322070 Is it dwarfs with an 'f',<br />or dwarves, with a 'v'?
2322100 2323640 I want to use whatever's more offensive.
2323680 2325730 Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.
2325810 2327990 I heard that! It's Avv-vous-rarge!
2328020 2328950 Oh, please.
2328980 2334370 Inside your amateurs attempt at a facade<br />of a sham of a travesty of a veneer of a castle
2334400 2337530 is a gorgeous wanted criminal.
2337610 2342160 I hereby command that all of you exit<br />the premises and surrender post haste.
2342280 2346250 Fail to comply, and you will<br />never see these two again.
2346500 2348120 You have until three.
2348400 2349400 One.
2351630 2352410 Two.
2352590 2353960 I lied. Charge!
2374610 2376000 Am I the person you want?
2376030 2377860 Yes, yes you are.
2378070 2381610 Though I don't know if you're a person<br />or a vision of beauty, some kind of angelic
2381950 2385620 thing with wings. Angelic wing things?
2385990 2389440 I will come with you,<br />but only after you release my friends.
2389660 2390670 Do it. Do it!
2392710 2395440 Now, here's the good news.<br />It's my birthday!
2395590 2399050 And you are going to be<br />the belle of the ball.
2399090 2402840 The invitation sounds great,<br />really. But...
2402930 2405180 It wasn't an invitation,<br />more of an order.
2405300 2406280 Prepare the lady's carriage.
2406310 2408860 She said she doesn't want to go, Average.
2408890 2411810 Avv-vous-rarge!
2411940 2413560 Don't troll me, Troll.
2413940 2415080 Ah! So rude.
2415110 2417370 I couldn't agree more.<br />Subjects these days.
2417400 2418530 Now. Shall we?
2427120 2428120 Get her!
2428370 2430050 You hold off the guards, and<br />I'll get her out of here.
2430080 2433120 No, I'm faster. You stay<br />here and buy us time.
2441450 2442260 Here's a thought.
2442450 2444640 Stop fighting and fight!
2446180 2447220 What's the plan?
2448260 2449740 Rescue Red Shoes.
2449770 2451680 Like the old days, guys.
2486680 2487680 Arthur!
2493680 2495850 Can we get this over with?<br />They're just dwarfs!
2508160 2510620 Did you guys hear something?
2519670 2520670 Come on!
2541070 2542070 Duck!
2548240 2550530 Hi, guards, are we taking a break?
2550620 2551750 ... well, FYI
2551780 2554040 They're getting away!
2560940 2562040 No!
2568050 2570390 Who's throwin' vegetables?
2574930 2577810 Yeah! You just got Merlined!
2585990 2586990 Run!
2588400 2589400 Jack!
2600120 2601120 Duck!
2606050 2607800 I'm so sorry. You alright?
2607920 2610180 No. I'm not.
2615890 2618890 Gentlemen, he surrenders.
2619100 2620100 What?
2650130 2651550 Engines. Full power.
2651630 2652630 Shields up.
2653590 2655140 Turn on the mini frizzer.
2673910 2675400 Superhero landing!
2675570 2676530 Hooray for us!
2676580 2678950 - We did it!<br />- It was mostly me.
2678990 2679990 Yeah!
2680500 2681500 What?
2684960 2686210 You've got to be kidding.
2686290 2688800 Finally the big guns, thank you.
2689050 2690050 Fire!
2698350 2699350 Fire!
2705270 2706810 Ooh, close.
2707150 2708940 The cannonball. Not you.
2709650 2711990 timeout, timeout.<br />Everyone, timeout.
2712360 2715670 You almost blew her up, and she can't<br />come to my party if you blow her up.
2715700 2716820 Sorry, sir.
2717200 2718660 Alright. Time back in.
2719660 2720870 Surrender monsters!
2720910 2722080 No! Wait!
2754610 2755950 Oh. That's pretty cool.
2763830 2765750 Everyone inside. And hurry!
2779720 2782140 You messed with the wrong prince.
2782310 2784980 There is nothing average about Avv-vous-rarge.
2785180 2788430 I shall return!
2788650 2789580 On Tuesday.
2789610 2791950 No, wait. I'll check my calendar...
2791980 2796070 Thursday, I shall return Thursday!
2797440 2798700 We'll be ready.
2798740 2799530 And waiting.
2799620 2800590 Arrivederci!
2800620 2801620 Ciao for now!
2801700 2802440 Bye bye!
2802580 2804200 You just got dwarfed!
2804330 2806370 Is that better? I think Merlined is better.
2822600 2827140 You should have seen the look on his big<br />ugly face when bunny came running at him.
2828190 2830370 That's how you see everything, isn't it?
2830400 2831690 With my eyes?
2831900 2834780 You always talk about<br />what someone looks like.
2834860 2837360 I do? I wouldn't say that.
2837430 2839990 But I can't wait for you<br />to see the real me.
2840280 2842160 What kind of Merlin is the real you?
2842370 2843780 You might not believe it,
2843870 2847440 but the real me is famous,<br />handsome, and even popular.
2847580 2850540 Not short, stumpy and green.
2850670 2853970 Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but
2854000 2856930 you're also a wonderful and charming person.
2856960 2858450 I'm not explaining it right.
2858550 2862140 If you saw the real me,<br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
2862970 2864930 I think I can see the real you.
2865560 2868770 And I like you, just as you are.
2870640 2871940 That's hilarious.
2872230 2876070 Here, close your eyes,<br />and imagine the real me.
2876570 2879070 I guarantee you, it'll be different.
2880740 2884370 I do feel something different ..
2884580 2885580 Really?
2885780 2888000 But eyes opened or closed
2888080 2890330 to me you're still Merlin.
2891710 2896250 Now tell me, who am I to you?
2896840 2898380 You're a gift.
2898510 2902720 A gift that'll transform me<br />into someone amazing.
2903420 2905510 Just like you're amazing.
2913770 2916820 Actually, I want to show you something too.
2921400 2922820 You need a hand?
2922950 2926330 Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.
2926950 2928510 ...One...
2928540 2930290 Two, yeah, okay, I need help.
2948590 2950090 Woah. Woah woah woah.
2950100 2951890 No thankyou.
2957980 2961150 You know what the weird thing is?<br />They're super comfortable.
2963400 2966750 Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were<br />you when the facade was falling?
2966780 2968910 I mean, that was terrifying.
2970740 2971830 What're you doing here?
2973830 2975750 I have come for my shoes.
2976040 2980410 Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.<br />But those dwarfs!
2980440 2982970 It's dwarves with a 'v'.<br />So you failed?
2983670 2987680 I did not fail, I took a timeout.
2987760 2989780 Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.
2989810 2991930 I'm going to return on Thursday,<br />we all pencilled it in.
2992060 2993060 Silence!
2993350 2994850 Have a bite.
2995400 2996850 For strength.
2997520 3001700 Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.
3001730 3004400 I don't have much time, Prince.
3004700 3008700 You could still have the<br />best birthday ever,
3008870 3010340 But remember...
3010370 3017000 What's bad for me,<br />will be very bad for you.
3023090 3024090 She's gone.
3025300 3027590 Ah! What's the worst that could happen.
3031640 3032640 It's kind of sweet.
3048910 3049910 Don't move.
3050030 3050590 Okay.
3050620 3052710 Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.
3052740 3053670 Okey doky!
3053700 3054510 Here we go!
3054540 3055660 Our pleasure.
3062920 3065420 ... here we go, yeah, a little
3065440 3066590 Oooh a little over here!
3083320 3085120 Now that looks like a real home.
3085150 3087110 Yep. I could get used to that.
3087320 3088530 Uh uh. I cannot.
3092200 3095200 It's a perfect copy of my drawing.<br />That's incredible.
3096540 3097790 Let me try.
3098960 3101320 This will definitely make it easier to<br />find your dad.
3101380 3103680 Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.
3103710 3104560 It's grounded.
3104590 3105600 Why does it need to fly?
3105630 3108380 The posters are no good if we<br />can't distribute them fast.
3108630 3112550 Guys, thankyou so much for<br />everything you're doing.
3113050 3115050 - My pleasure.<br />- It's nice.
3184630 3185670 Opening doors!
3201730 3204940 You know Merlin, I feel so<br />lucky that I've met you.
3205650 3207520 I feel the same way.
3207940 3211280 I feel like anything is possible.
3212610 3214080 ¶ Darling
3215780 3219620 ¶ Come on out there and take my hand
3219950 3223750 ¶ I will show you that I'm your man
3223830 3226750 ¶ Is that okay
3227540 3229670 Merlin! Watch out!
3240680 3242100 Merlin.
3243930 3244980 Merlin.
3246270 3247270 Merlin!
3247690 3249190 Everything okay?
3249610 3250820 Of course! Sure!
3251610 3252870 Nothing to be embarrassed about.
3252900 3257130 So why are we even talking about<br />that when we should be going...
3257160 3258160 this direction.
3258320 3259320 Hey wait!
3263040 3265960 So, about these magic shoes.
3266120 3267340 Why, are they still bothering you?
3267370 3269380 What kind of magic do<br />those shoes have?
3269750 3272750 Well .. how do I put this.
3272960 3276720 Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.
3277130 3279360 And, I was always proud of that.
3279390 3284450 But, the shoes magic, umm,<br />it made me a little dainty?
3284560 3285610 Sorry to hear.
3285640 3289940 The shoes made me lose<br />a little bit of weight.
3290150 3291370 It could be worse.
3291400 3292730 ..Okay.
3293730 3295320 - A lot of weight.<br />- Ah.
3296400 3300530 Well, I know what it's like to look different on<br />the outside from what you feel on the inside.
3305200 3309250 Merlin, I'd like to give you a<br />token of my appreciation.
3310670 3312670 Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.
3312880 3313390 Why?
3313410 3316050 Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.
3317260 3318260 Give me a second.
3330690 3334570 There. Consider it your good luck charm.
3338030 3339110 Thank you.
3345660 3349440 Merlin, do you think we'd be happier
3349750 3351960 if we were our old selves again?
3352130 3354880 Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.
3355050 3356300 I don't know.
3357410 3359010 I like how we are.
3359760 3363140 Right here, just, right now.
3363800 3367520 Even if I'm an ugly green monster?
3369020 3372600 I don't care about your height<br />or what colour you are.
3373520 3377070 And that's the way you feel about me, right?
3377190 3380320 Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!
3381990 3385780 I think we're both just trapped<br />under the same spell.
3402050 3408180 Wait. Keep your eyes closed<br />and don't open them until I say.
3408350 3410420 When you open your eyes there will be...
3410640 3413320 a handsome man in front of you.
3413350 3414830 Someone worthy of you.
3414860 3417070 Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.
3418280 3419430 I think you're right.
3419530 3422070 Ready? And...
3422400 3425570 Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!
3428080 3429080 Now!
3429540 3430700 Ta-da!
3430870 3433870 You just got Merlined!
3434080 3435250 What do you think?
3435670 3438920 Mission impossibly handsome, right?
3440670 3444050 Oh, it's okay,<br />I know this is a lot to take in.
3444380 3446940 But you can let your happiness flag fly.
3446970 3450890 This, this is the real me.
3451810 3453890 - It's stupid.<br />- What?
3455060 3456270 Wait a minute!
3456730 3459270 My hands are still green sausages.
3460400 3462570 No! I look the same.
3462820 3465360 Yes, impossibly handsome.
3465400 3467570 This doesn't make sense.
3467700 3470700 You're the most beautiful woman in<br />the world, why do I look the same?
3470910 3472840 What're you talking about, Merlin?
3472870 3474290 Do I need a longer kiss?
3474750 3475750 Two kisses?
3476630 3478210 Let's try again.
3478740 3479740 Umm.
3479750 3481170 You're not making any sense.
3490420 3491420 Hurry!
3493400 3494400 What is that?
3494680 3497270 This kingdom has a serious<br />monster problem.
3513160 3513720 Are you alright?
3513750 3515660 No. I'm not.
3524170 3524800 Thank you.
3524840 3526090 Pleasure, milady.
3528450 3529450 Watch out!
3547070 3549110 Ha-hah! Yes!
3555200 3557680 What do they want,<br />besides smashing us?
3557710 3558710 I don't know!
3567720 3569260 The old me would've nailed that.
3577770 3579140 You just got Merlined!
3590110 3591110 Hurry!
3606500 3607980 Red, close your eyes.
3608010 3609850 This is no time for kissing, Merlin.
3609880 3612010 Trust me. Close your eyes.
3613220 3614890 Please, close them!
3619560 3620980 That was too close.
3621770 3623190 Don't look at me.
3623350 3625370 You see that tree on the<br />other side of the bridge?
3625400 3625990 Yeah.
3626020 3629040 On my signal, run towards<br />it as fast as you can.
3629070 3630570 No, I can't leave you here.
3630740 3633950 You have to.<br />And don't look back, okay?
3634120 3636520 Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.
3636620 3638210 Promise you won't look.
3638240 3640710 Okay. I promise.
3641290 3642290 Now!
3673780 3674790 What?
3674820 3677120 You just got Merlined?<br />Oh. Yes you did.
3706150 3707860 Hey! Locate!
3708900 3710650 Hey, locate here!
3710940 3713990 You're even more of a blockhead<br />than Prince Average.
3716200 3718660 Avv-vous-rarge!
3718950 3720440 Prince Average?
3736680 3738260 You just got Merlined.
3741850 3743180 Take a look, Red Shoes.
3743520 3744070 Merlin!
3744100 3746560 I have triumphantly saved the day.
3747730 3748730 Merlin, no!
3751150 3752430 Merlin!
3757280 3758570 Merlin!
3823390 3824890 Snow White?
3834400 3836070 Snow White?
3836430 3839280 The thief was Snow White<br />this whole time?
3839360 3842870 Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
3844660 3847120 You're going after her yourself?
3847200 3848750 What? Were you going to go?
3849440 3851960 I get it! I don't have legs.
3854540 3857920 So, here I am.
3859010 3860170 All the real me.
3861800 3863220 I bet you're disappointed, huh?
3863420 3866480 You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.
3866510 3867070 Red Shoes!
3867100 3870430 That's not my name, it's Snow White.
3870560 3873070 Princess Snow White? So your father is...
3873100 3875520 King White, yeah.
3875860 3879430 By the time I figured out his<br />new wife Regina was a witch
3880440 3882280 he'd already disappeared.
3882820 3885340 And the monsters who attacked us
3885370 3889370 were sent by my stepmother<br />to get these shoes.
3890660 3893620 I guess being beautiful is really<br />worth that much to her.
3893960 3896880 Have you thought about<br />just giving them back?
3897880 3899510 And give up their magic?
3900720 3904300 If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't<br />have helped me find my father, would you?
3905260 3906600 Would you?
3910400 3912880 I thought we were both<br />under the same spell.
3914100 3917400 But I see now that I was wrong.
3917820 3923320 Listen, I can't get into all the details,<br />but I'm under a curse too.
3923740 3925660 You still don't get it, Merlin.
3926870 3929370 I'm not talking about our curses.
3930080 3932870 Merlin, I'm talking about<br />the kind of spell
3934080 3936170 you never want to break.
3984880 3987390 He likes you more than he likes me.
4019290 4022630 What would've happened if she'd taken<br />off her shoes that day in the barn?
4022670 4024090 You think that's important?
4026670 4028430 I just wonder,
4028450 4031420 what I would've done if I'd<br />seen the real Snow White.
4031680 4033060 Seriously?
4033140 4035420 It's still all about appearance for you.
4035640 4038350 No! Not exactly.
4039350 4042190 But I can't live looking like<br />you for the rest of my life
4042360 4046650 Kind of proving my point, other me.<br />Alright. Let's try this.
4047150 4049820 Who do you like more,<br />Snow White or Red Shoes?
4049990 4051910 Easy, it's Red Shoes.
4052070 4054740 Now, which of us do you<br />think Red Shoes likes more?
4054830 4056540 Easy, it's me!
4058440 4061080 Wait. No.
4061670 4062840 It's...
4063210 4064250 you.
4085730 4091070 ¶ You came in my life in a high flash of lightning
4091160 4096120 ¶ I covered my eyes but there's no use in hiding
4096200 4100290 ¶ This feeling has stuck and I couldn't say
4100370 4101620 You're a gift.
4101920 4103620 A gift that'll transform me
4103640 4105970 into someone amazing.
4106000 4110720 ¶ This is the start of something so right
4110880 4115760 ¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned
4116100 4120810 ¶ In the right place at the right time
4121100 4126150 ¶ This is the start of something so right
4126980 4130950 Well, I know what it's like to look different on<br />the outside to what we feel on the inside.
4131280 4136400 ¶ This is the start of something so right
4141400 4149090 ¶ This is the start of something so right
4150760 4151920 Look at that!
4156600 4159650 The shoes. You're wearing them.
4159680 4161390 I thought you left.
4161600 4163140 You should take them off again.
4168430 4169430 I can't.
4170230 4173200 You just had to make things complicated.
4174240 4175620 Maybe this will help.
4175820 4178170 Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.
4178200 4179330 Where did you get that?
4179620 4181910 I want to help you, Snow White.
4182160 4183160 Please.
4189840 4190840 Red Shoes?
4191410 4192410 Merlin?
4193340 4194340 Merlin?
4197180 4199640 What terrible timing you have.
4202640 4204640 We're gonna have to do this the hard way.
4205350 4206350 Regina?
4209770 4212740 Such a tender family reunion.
4213070 4215200 So sad we can't stay!
4216030 4217110 Red Shoes!
4219580 4221510 Come on, let's go, longears.
4221540 4223090 Hey! Wait for us!
4223120 4225160 How 'bout you go back<br />and get the others?
4225330 4227290 And make lots of copies of this.
4227880 4228880 Let's go!
4231380 4232730 We can do this.
4232760 4233760 Yeah!
4236180 4238640 Your power my lady. It has drained you.
4238720 4242600 You think? I don't need<br />you to tell me how I look.
4242770 4244990 I'm a mirror. It's what I do.
4245020 4247910 M - I - R - O - R.<br />I can't spell.
4247940 4248940 Enough.
4250110 4251360 Bind her.
4252400 4254530 It's snack time.
4258160 4260370 How can you sleep at<br />a time like this?
4262030 4264720 I'm not supposed to talk<br />when I have this on,
4264750 4268170 but I got to ask.<br />Do you think they've kissed yet?
4268250 4269250 I hope so,
4269330 4272290 because it'll feel better to<br />punch Merlin when he's pretty.
4273500 4276690 We've been waiting for a...<br />Where have you been?
4276720 4277730 Did you break the curse yet?
4277760 4279420 Merlin, are you hungry?
4279640 4280760 Those are bears.
4280790 4281790 Ah...
4281800 4284680 Hi? This is from Merlin.
4303080 4305040 Wow! This is so cool.
4308910 4310290 Okay, sword.
4310440 4315250 If you think you've humiliated, embarrassed,<br />and otherwise frustrated me,
4315760 4316920 you're right.
4317410 4321090 But that ends now!
4330690 4332730 Oh, zut alors. Please end this.
4344370 4348470 Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.
4348500 4349830 The castle's over there.
4366760 4367760 Sit.
4379430 4383240 Eat this darling, and you'll<br />get your freedom.
4383400 4384740 Where is my father?
4385400 4389440 Royal loyal little girl,<br />pining for her papa?
4389830 4394120 This is getting a little boring, so I need<br />you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.
4394250 4395670 I won't let you win.
4396090 4399550 You've torn apart my family,<br />and you will not get away with it, Regina.
4400590 4403450 Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.
4403720 4406680 Very well. A different approach.
4415350 4416350 - Merlin!<br />- No!
4416810 4419360 Eat the apple, or watch him die.
4419530 4420400 That's your choice.
4420430 4422330 Don't do it. No!
4422360 4424240 No!
4425690 4426690 Red Shoes!
4426700 4428950 Promise to me, you'll let him go.
4429120 4432440 Oh absolutely.<br />When the third bell chimes,
4432620 4435540 everything will be just<br />like it used to be.
4435670 4437960 No! No no no.
4440170 4441960 Save my papa for me.
4452430 4453930 Red Shoes!
4468740 4473370 A legendary handsome knight,<br />fearless rescuer of princesses.
4473500 4478580 Sitting in a tree,<br />not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.
4479750 4481410 Burn. I can't spell.
4483760 4485230 You don't have to do this.
4485260 4487340 Just take the shoes and let us go.
4487800 4490550 I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.
4490680 4493690 The fruit of temptation and want.<br />They feed on your desires
4493720 4498190 Once they give you what you desire,<br />the bond is permanent.
4498400 4500650 That's not true. She took<br />them off in the river.
4500730 4502400 That doesn't make any sense.
4502430 4507070 How could she possibly want to save you<br />more than she wanted to be beautiful?
4507320 4509400 What did you do to her?
4509660 4511580 Did you cast a spell?
4513700 4515260 What's going to happen to her?
4515290 4520220 Well, once she eats the apple, its magic<br />will turn her into a magic apple tree.
4520250 4523340 The first bell, nothing really happens,<br />but very dramatic.
4523550 4525850 The tree bears fruit,<br />and the second bell...
4525880 4528090 Oh! Excitement mounts!
4528340 4530300 The morning sun touches the fruit
4530450 4533030 turning it into a new<br />pair of red shoes
4533060 4536020 And number three, the circle of life!
4536390 4537390 And then what?
4537520 4541020 Regina will be the most<br />beautiful person in the kingdom.
4541400 4542330 Forever.
4542360 4545230 I don't care about her,<br />what about Snow White?
4545400 4549630 The tree withers and dies,<br />and so does Snow White.
4549660 4551440 No!
4551570 4553280 Yes!
4554080 4557830 Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.
4574720 4577560 Why don't you come back and play?
4583900 4585270 Not so fast.
4595030 4596160 It's gonna hurt.
4599830 4602880 Oh yeah! Stretch it out.
4614470 4615670 Uh-oh.
4619980 4621140 Smoke! Smoke!
4621350 4623320 We're here, bitch. Are you okay?
4623350 4624810 Yeah.
4625400 4627400 I never thought I'd say this,
4628110 4630400 but I'm so glad to be chubby<br />and green again.
4631200 4634400 Seven to one.<br />I like those odds.
4634620 4635660 Let's go.
4637620 4639620 We like those odds even better.
4642440 4644210 Are you up to this, muchacho?
4645380 4647750 You finally pulled out Excalibur.
4647880 4652020 Oh, yes, yes. I did it.<br />That's exactly how it went down.
4652050 4654300 Here you go Merlin.<br />You're gonna need these.
4654340 4655340 Thanks.
4661060 4663350 Here comes the sun.
4663810 4665650 Now let's all get dwarfed.
4669570 4674070 Ah, this is where your<br />fairy tale ends, trolls.
4678700 4679700 You missed.
4716570 4718320 Au revoir, mirror!
4733410 4734670 Finally.
4743350 4746060 It's a good day to break a curse.
4747730 4749940 Eternal Beauty.
4763160 4764160 I'm sorry
4764700 4766040 Snow White.
4769120 4772340 Ahhh!
4799360 4802070 Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.
4808440 4809420 Woah! We're back!
4809440 4810500 Yippee!
4820930 4821930 Papa?
4832060 4833430 Snow White?
4835730 4836820 Oh papa!
4836940 4837940 Snow!
4843200 4844200 Wait.
4844370 4845620 Where's Merlin?
4845740 4847400 I'm so sorry.
4847870 4851830 He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
4852290 4853960 Merlin, no!
4857000 4858550 Merlin!
4919070 4920690 I thought you were gone.
4921530 4925820 You're the most beautiful<br />woman in the world.
4927660 4930160 With my eyes open
4931910 4933370 or closed.
4944670 4945670 No.
4963070 4964900 I got Merlined.
4990100 4991720 You're a prince, Merlin.
4999310 5001980 Yeah, that Merlin.
5002400 5005400 The one who's not really your type.
5009160 5011740 I kind of liked the short<br />and green Merlin.
5014160 5016710 But I'm still that Merlin inside.
5017790 5020410 Yes, yes you are.
5038980 5040600 Any idea who that girl is?
5052400 5054600 ¶ I'm feeling good today
5055800 5058300 ¶ Aint nothing standing in my way
5058300 5060500 ¶ I wouldn't change a thing
5060500 5064000 ¶ I must get hot walking in a dream
5064000 5067500 ¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare
5067500 5070500 ¶ People talk but I don't care

5108920 5111920 ¶ I learned to dance in the suits I'm in
