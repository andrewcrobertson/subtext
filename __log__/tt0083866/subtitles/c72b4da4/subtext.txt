640766 642734 Mom! There's<br />something out...
642801 644200 Where's the pizza?
644269 645702 There's something<br />out there!
645771 647136 In the tool shed.
647205 649639 It threw<br />the ball at me.
649708 651471 Quiet!

693452 694942 Look at these.
699858 702793 Coyote's come<br />back again, Mom.

938330 939490 Hello?
990181 993548 What are you going as<br />for Halloween?
993618 995882 I'm not going<br />to stupid Halloween.
995954 997751 Go as a goblin.
997822 999380 Shut up.
999457 1002255 It's not<br />that we don't
1002327 1003885 Well, it was real.
1003962 1007398 What are<br />you going as, Gert?
1007465 1010593 I'm going<br />as a cowgirl.
1010668 1013102 So what else<br />is new?
1013171 1015264 Maybe it was<br />an iguana.
1015340 1016932 It was no iguana.
1017008 1018032 Maybe a...
1018109 1019940 You know<br />how they say
1020011 1022172 there are alligators<br />in the sewers?
1022247 1024238 Alligators<br />in the sewers.
1024315 1026579 All we're<br />trying to say is
1026651 1028118 maybe<br />you imagined it.
1028186 1029585 I couldn't have.
1029654 1031246 Maybe<br />a deformed kid.
1031322 1033483 A deformed kid.
1033558 1036186 Maybe an elf<br />or leprechaun.
1036261 1038286 It wasn't that,<br />penis breath!
1038363 1040058 Elliott!
1040131 1041860 Sit down.
1043835 1044767 Ahem.
1044836 1047464 Dad would believe me.
1050675 1053439 Maybe you ought<br />to call your father
1053511 1055479 and tell him<br />about it.
1055547 1056775 I can't.
1056848 1058873 He's in Mexico<br />with Sally.
1068860 1072352 Wh-Where's Mexico?
1075533 1076795 Excuse me.
1081940 1084204 I'm going<br />to kill you.
1084275 1087108 If you see it again,<br />whatever it is,
1087178 1089112 don't touch it.<br />Just call me.
1089180 1092013 We'll have somebody<br />take it away.
1092083 1095052 Like the dogcatcher?
1095120 1096951 They'll give it<br />a lobotomy
1097021 1100047 or do experiments on it<br />or something.
1100125 1102650 Your turn<br />to do the dishes.
1102727 1104194 I set and cleared.
1104262 1105194 I did.
1105263 1106662 I did breakfast.
1106731 1108289 I did breakfast.
1111169 1112761 What's the matter, Mom?
1115707 1117572 He hates Mexico.
1118576 1119474 Damn it!
1119544 1121307 Why don't you<br />grow up?
1121379 1124439 Think how<br />other people feel

1594018 1596316 You were<br />outside last night
1596387 1598855 waiting<br />for that thing,

1751542 1753009 You want some?
1756247 1757737 This is a peanut.

1883807 1887800 Thirty-five pounds!<br />You're so fat!
1892750 1894741 I wonder how tall you are.

1919476 1921410 This is hot and this is cold.
1921478 1924242 Now, it all comes<br />from a big water tower.
1924315 1926909 It goes through pipes<br />and sometimes
1926984 1930920 dead bugs come through<br />and land in the bath.
1930988 1933684 It's real sick.<br />Anyway, look...
1937928 1940658 Are you thirsty?

2008132 2010760 Uhhh!
2017641 2019666 You could drown in stuff<br />like this.
2031321 2033619 Is this your idea<br />of a good time?
2037461 2038894 # Accidents<br />will happen #
2038962 2041021 # But it's only<br />hit-and-run #
2041098 2045034 # There are<br />so many people to see #

2066490 2067923 Mike, come in.
2067991 2069390 How you feeling,<br />faker?
2069460 2071394 I got something<br />really important...
2071462 2075296 Tyler said he got 69,000<br />on Asteroids yesterday.
2075365 2077390 Look, remember<br />the goblin?
2077468 2079197 You're so lame,<br />Elliott.
2079269 2081396 Come on, Michael.<br />He came back.
2081472 2084305 He came back?
2084374 2086308 He came back?
2086376 2088003 Oh, my God!
2088078 2090012 One thing.
2090080 2092310 I have<br />absolute power.
2092382 2094009 Say it.
2094084 2095551 What have you got?
2095619 2096984 Is it the coyote?
2097054 2099249 No. Look...
2100757 2102486 O.K. Now, swear it...
2102559 2106325 The most excellent<br />promise you can make.
2106396 2110355 Swear as my only brother<br />on our lives.
2110434 2112868 Don't get so heavy.<br />I swear.
2112936 2115496 O.K. Stand over there.
2115572 2118473 You'd better take off<br />your shoulder pads.
2118542 2119975 You might scare him.
2120043 2122273 And close your eyes.
2122346 2123779 Don't push it, Elliott.
2123847 2125280 I'm not<br />coming out there
2125349 2127317 until your eyes<br />are closed.
2127384 2129477 O.K. They're closed.
2129553 2131987 Mom is going<br />to kill you.
2132055 2133955 Aah! Ohh! Ooh!
2134024 2137425 O.K. Swear it<br />one more time.
2137494 2141225 You have absolute<br />power. Eerrp!
2152042 2155569 Elliott! Look what<br />I made for you!
2156713 2157839 Aahr!

2166790 2168417 Aah!
2168492 2170687 Aah!
2170761 2171921 Mmm!
2171995 2173587 Kids, I'm home!
2173664 2174995 Guys?
2175065 2176430 In the closet, fast.
2176500 2177967 Anybody up there,<br />kids?
2178035 2179730 Aah!
2179803 2180929 Aahr!
2181004 2182631 Anybody home?
2182706 2184936 Hi, honey,<br />how do you fee...
2185008 2187033 What happened<br />in here?
2188512 2190537 Oh, you mean my room.
2192382 2194316 This is no room.
2194384 2195976 This is an accident.
2196053 2197452 I was, um...
2197521 2198818 reorganizing.
2198889 2200322 I can see that.
2200390 2203359 Put those shelves<br />back on the wall.
2203427 2206362 Get the toys<br />off the floor.
2206430 2207863 Make your bed.
2207931 2209831 You're feeling better,<br />I see.
2209900 2212266 You guys watch<br />Gertie for me
2212336 2214827 while I take a shower.
2214905 2216065 Absolutely.
2217541 2218735 Bye, Mom.
2219876 2221400 Whew!
2227384 2229409 Uhhh.
2229486 2230919 Elliott...
2230988 2233013 I'm keeping him.
2233090 2234887 Ahhr...
2234958 2236619 What is it?
2237995 2240623 He won't hurt you,<br />Gertie.
2240697 2244155 He won't hurt you,<br />Gertie.
2244234 2246202 We're not going<br />to hurt you.
2246270 2249296 Is he a boy or a girl?
2249373 2250965 He's a boy.
2254177 2257078 Was he wearing<br />any clothes?
2257147 2258614 No.
2258682 2260582 But, look...
2260651 2264109 you can't tell.<br />Not even Mom.
2264187 2265415 Why not?
2265489 2268515 Because, um...<br />grownups can't see him.
2269526 2272393 Only little kids<br />can see him.
2272462 2274089 Give me a break.
2274164 2277463 Well, do you know<br />what's going to happen
2277534 2279593 if you do tell?
2282506 2284440 Do it, Mike.<br />We have to.
2284508 2285941 Oh, no, please!
2286009 2288637 Don't do anything,<br />please!
2288712 2290043 Help me!
2290113 2291603 No, please!
2291682 2292614 Give it!
2292683 2293672 Promise?
2293750 2294739 Yes.
2294818 2296342 Do you promise?
2323847 2325712 Runff.
2325782 2327113 Runff.
2366990 2368890 What are you<br />doing, Gert?
2368959 2372895 I'm going to play<br />in Elliott's room.
2372963 2375295 O.K. Don't let him<br />torture you.
2375365 2376764 I won't, Mary.
2383206 2384195 Hello?
2384274 2385468 Ahhr...
2385542 2387373 Jer-Jerry!
2393016 2395484 Come on, come on.<br />Hurry up.
2395552 2398749 Don't be pushy,<br />pushy.
2402225 2403749 A plant for you.
2403827 2405226 Maybe he's some animal
2405295 2407286 that wasn't<br />supposed to live.
2407364 2408797 I brought<br />some clay...
2408865 2410833 Like those<br />rabbits we saw.
2410901 2411833 Green, orange...
2411902 2413335 Could be a monkey.
2413403 2414563 A bald monkey?
2414638 2417664 Is he a pig? He<br />sure eats like one.
2417741 2419231 You could<br />make faces.
2419309 2423405 And make them<br />mean... and happy
2423480 2425948 and make them<br />get sharp teeth...
2426016 2427813 We are here.
2427884 2428908 We're here.
2428985 2430145 Use this.
2430220 2433121 You could make<br />all sorts of things.
2433190 2435488 O.K. We're here.
2435559 2437390 We are here.
2437461 2439258 Where are you from?
2439329 2440853 Ahhr...
2452242 2454176 I don't like his feet.
2454244 2456678 They're only feet,<br />you little twerp.
2456746 2459476 He's trying<br />to tell us something.
2468458 2469618 Earth.
2470760 2472125 Home.
2473263 2474389 Home.
2475365 2476593 Home.
2513436 2515028 What's he doing?
2516006 2518804 What's happening?
2530954 2532251 Elliott.
2534758 2536157 Oh, no.
2539095 2540084 Aah!
2549773 2551206 Elliott,<br />what is it?
2551274 2553299 I don't know.<br />Something scary.
2573897 2574795 Got a pulse?
2574864 2576058 No, boss.
2579869 2582895 Hold it.<br />We got it right here.
2584207 2585333 Follow him.
2585408 2586568 O.K.
2588044 2589739 You think this house?
2599189 2600679 Hmm.
2607530 2609464 Mmm.
2609532 2612524 Mmrrr.
2620944 2622377 Did you<br />explain school?
2622445 2624913 How do you explain school<br />to higher intelligence?
2624981 2628382 Maybe he's not that smart.<br />Maybe he's a worker bee.
2628451 2629383 He's smart.
2629452 2632421 I hope we don't<br />wake up on Mars
2632489 2635253 surrounded by millions<br />of these squashy guys.
2641331 2642730 Hi, Elliott.
2642799 2644767 Hey, Elliott,<br />where's your goblin?
2644834 2645732 Shut up.
2645802 2647235 Did he come back?
2647303 2648235 Did he?
2648304 2650238 Yeah,<br />he came back.
2650306 2652274 But he's<br />not a goblin.
2652342 2654242 He's a spaceman.
2654310 2656278 As in extraterrestrial.
2656346 2657745 Where's he from?
2657814 2659782 Uranus? Get it?<br />Your anus?
2659849 2661282 He doesn't get it.
2661351 2662784 Get it? Your anus?
2662852 2664285 He doesn't get it.
2664354 2665343 You're<br />so immature.
2665422 2666787 <i>And you're<br />a cintus suprimus.</i>
2666856 2667788 Zero charisma.
2667857 2668789 <i>Cintus suprimus.</i>
2668858 2669916 Zero charisma.
2669993 2671290 Shut up, Greg!
2671361 2673329 <i>Cintus suprimus.</i>
2673396 2674294 Zero charisma!
2674364 2675422 You wimp.
2684774 2686298 Let's go.
2689279 2691247 Come on.<br />Get in the car.
2691314 2692804 We'll be late.
2735358 2736450 Hummm.
2736526 2736992 OK, boys and girls,
2738061 2741394 today we will be doing<br />the actual frog dissection
2741464 2743489 for which<br />we've been preparing.
2744567 2747161 And you will find...
2747237 2748966 many similarities.
2755078 2757478 As you get<br />into the dissection,
2757547 2760072 you will discover<br />that the anatomy...
2790480 2794416 The scalpel<br />is very sharp.
2794484 2797578 Use discretion<br />when you are cutting.
2797654 2800122 There will be<br />very little blood.
2800190 2803125 There may be<br />a few body fluids.
2835725 2837090 Yecchh!
2854310 2856107 As we<br />get started with...
2857247 2858179 the dissection...
2858248 2859613 Ew!<br />Ew!
2859682 2864016 remember that the things<br />you are writing down...
2867690 2868884 Ahhr...
2871895 2872884 Urp!
2874063 2875291 Some of the things
2875365 2878300 that you should look<br />for during the dissection
2878368 2879801 is the heart,
2879869 2882895 and notice that<br />it is still beating.
2885174 2886402 Oof!
2886476 2889445 I'm going to once more<br />emphasize the similarities
2889512 2891980 of those things<br />which we see...
2894550 2896381 Mmm.
2896452 2900013 Similarities with<br />human anatomy.
2900089 2902819 First of all,<br />here's the heart.
2908464 2911456 The intestines<br />will be going
2911534 2914196 through their<br />peristaltic action.
2915471 2918702 <i>X-W-V-U</i>
2918775 2921300 <i>A-F-P.</i>
2921377 2922901 <i>That is incorrect.</i>
2922979 2925072 <i>The correct spelling<br />of nuisance</i>
2925148 2927946 <i>is N-U-I-</i>
2928017 2930247 <i>S-A-N-C-E.</i>
2930320 2932345 <i>Yeow!</i>
2937560 2938959 <i>They're<br />pulling us up.</i>
2945368 2947802 Class, these are<br />the cotton balls
2947870 2949303 with the chloroform.
2949372 2952273 As soon as I<br />get them all in,
2952342 2954810 put the lid on<br />right away.
2954877 2955809 Eww.
2955878 2957106 That's it.
2957180 2960206 That will start them<br />going to sleep.
2963019 2964782 They won't feel anything.
2964854 2966378 They won't be hurt.
2968391 2969949 It'll take a little while.
2970026 2972995 If you don't want<br />to watch them,
2973062 2974552 you don't have to.
2992648 2994673 Say hi.
2995852 2997410 Can you talk?
2997487 2999250 Can you say hi?
3000790 3002189 Ahhr...
3009532 3010692 Hic!
3019776 3021710 Mmm...
3024547 3025605 <i>Hello.</i>
3025681 3027444 <i>Uncle Ralph!</i>
3027517 3030452 <i>It's Uncle Ralph,<br />long distance
3030520 3032454 <i>This call<br />must be expensive.</i>
3032522 3035980 <i>Oh, no, no.<br />Anytime on Saturday
3036059 3038960 <i>it's 5 minutes<br />for 85 cents plus tax.</i>
3039028 3041895 <i>If I talk less,<br />I pay less.</i>
3041964 3044432 <i>Let me talk to<br />that little fella, huh?</i>
3044500 3045467 <i>Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.</i>
3045535 3047469 <i>Hello, Uncle Ralph.</i>
3068157 3069681 Save him.
3076699 3079600 Run for your life!<br />Back to the river!
3079669 3081136 Back to the forest!
3081204 3083798 Run! I want to save you!
3083873 3085932 Let's get out of here!
3088044 3089705 Get out!
3089779 3091770 I got to let him go!
3099021 3100989 You've got to save him!
3124814 3125906 Aah!<br />Aah!
3125982 3127415 Let me handle this!
3127483 3129508 Let me handle this!
3129585 3131314 I can handle this.
3131387 3132877 Let me get this.
3134657 3136215 <i>Aah!</i>
3138027 3139358 Aah!
3186475 3188568 <i>Stanford, what's wrong?</i>
3188644 3192080 <i>I'm afraid Betsy Sue isn't<br />going to run tomorrow.</i>
3192148 3194742 <i>Oh, no. Is it<br />anything serious?</i>
3194817 3197377 Harvey, I'm home.<br />Come here, boy.
3209332 3210765 Here he is.
3210833 3212300 Here's who?
3212368 3214268 The man from the moon,
3214337 3216271 but you've<br />killed him already.
3216339 3219365 As soon as I<br />unload the stuff, OK?
3223212 3224110 Mmm.
3224180 3225647 Med-bugs.
3227516 3229984 I want you<br />to meet somebody.
3230052 3232782 This stuff has<br />gone up so much.
3232855 3235289 I want you<br />to meet somebody.
3235358 3238384 When I finish putting<br />this stuff away, OK?
3248704 3252071 Stupid Ragu. I knew<br />it wouldn't come out.
3253409 3254467 <i>"B."<br />"B."</i>
3256545 3258012 What's with this?

3317440 3318873 Will you be...
3318941 3320431 Mommy, he can talk.
3320509 3321942 Of course he can.

3382805 3385740 I taught him<br />how to talk now.
3385808 3387366 He can talk now.
3387443 3390435 Look what he brought<br />up here all by himself.
3390513 3393414 What's he need<br />this stuff for?

3512968 3516165 <i>Now I wish I would've<br />listened in science.</i>
3516238 3517432 <i>Think, Michael.</i>
3517506 3520942 Just grab anything<br />he could make
3521010 3522875 <i>What would make a radar?</i>
3522945 3525311 How the hell do I know?
3525381 3526780 You're the genius here.
3526849 3528783 You have absolute<br />power, remember?
3528851 3531877 "I found him.<br />He belongs to me."
3545467 3547196 You know, Elliott,
3547269 3549635 he doesn't look<br />too good anymore.
3549705 3551138 Don't say that!
3551206 3552468 We're fine!
3552541 3554338 What's all this<br />"we" stuff?
3554410 3556742 <i>You say "we"<br />all the time.</i>
3556812 3559212 <i>Really, I think<br />he's getting sick.</i>
3559281 3560646 <i>Look, he's fine,<br />Michael!</i>
3560716 3563310 <i>OK! OK!<br />Forget I mentioned it.</i>

3578934 3583496 Remember when he<br />used to take us out
3583572 3585301 and take us<br />to the movies
3585374 3587137 and have<br />popcorn fights?
3587209 3589609 <i>We'll do that again,<br />Elliott.</i>

3738494 3740962 I told you<br />he was smart.
3741029 3742462 I'm worried,<br />Elliott.
3742531 3744123 He could blow up<br />the house.
3744199 3745826 He knows<br />what he's doing.
3745901 3748267 Listen to<br />how he's breathing.
3748337 3750601 It's going to work.
3750672 3752799 What's he<br />feeling now?
3752875 3754866 He's feeling everything.
3778834 3780768 You're going<br />as a ghost.
3780836 3781860 You promised.
3781937 3785498 I'm only pretending<br />I'm going as a cowgirl.
3785574 3789510 O.K. Now, you know<br />the plans by heart,
3789578 3791478 Meet you<br />at the lookout.
3791547 3794516 At the lookout.<br />I'm not stupid,
3794583 3797552 Listen, buster.<br />You won't get four blocks
3797619 3799712 in this neighborhood<br />dressed like that.
3799788 3801688 Please.<br />All the guys are.
3801757 3803850 I'm not stupid,<br />you know.
3812134 3813897 Ready?
3813969 3815129 Ready.
3831453 3833421 Oh, wait, Mom.<br />Don't look.
3833488 3834648 Oh, O.K.
3840629 3843928 OK, Mom.<br />You can look now.
3843999 3845296 Aah!
3847302 3848826 Oh, that's great.
3850706 3852003 Stay here.
3859514 3860981 Ooh.

3872828 3873920 O.K.
3879134 3880328 All right.

3884406 3885373 Thank you.
3885440 3886372 Thank you.
3886441 3887635 Thank you.

3895884 3898250 Be back one hour<br />after sundown.
3898320 3899344 No later.
3902257 3904384 Ohh.
3904459 3905721 Bye.
3907930 3908988 Aah!
3909064 3910929 Gertie, come here.<br />Come on.
3933522 3935046 Trick or treat.

3972948 3975109 Home. Home. Home.
3977590 3980024 Be back one hour<br />after sunset.
3980093 3981025 No later.
3981094 3984063 I'll try as fast<br />as I can, Mike.
3984130 3986121 You got to cover me.
3989302 3991202 Well, come on.<br />Help me.
3991271 3993671 We'll be waiting<br />for you, Elliott.
3993740 3995731 So come back for sure.
4021367 4022994 It's too bumpy.
4023069 4026038 We'll have<br />to walk from here!
4026105 4028073 E.T.!
4038918 4041978 Not so high!<br />Not so high!
4070783 4072410 Ah ha!
4079959 4082052 Don't crash, please.
4083796 4085263 Ugh!
4165778 4169805 I really can't believe<br />you did this.
4174387 4177584 Your father's going<br />to hear about this one.
4184073 4185097 Mexico.
4255778 4257769 Where's Elliot?
4259849 4262147 I'm asking you a question.
4263786 4268155 Anyways, why would Elliot<br />go to the forest?
4268224 4270954 Why would he<br />do such a thing?
4271027 4273461 Get in the car.
4273529 4276327 Get in the car now.
4293316 4295250 Runff.
4321877 4323811 E.T., it's working.
4323879 4325369 Oh.
4325448 4327040 It's working!
4327116 4328811 Home.
4328884 4330317 You did it!
4331887 4334014 It's working!
4334090 4336684 Home.
4336759 4340661 E.T., it's working!
4383939 4386840 We have to<br />go now, E.T.
4386909 4389343 We're so late<br />already.
4395885 4398854 We have to<br />go home now, E.T.
4398921 4399910 Hmm?
4404894 4407385 You should<br />give them some time.
4409365 4411833 Ouch.
4418607 4420472 You could<br />be happy here.
4420543 4422977 I could<br />take care of you.
4423045 4425513 I wouldn't let<br />anybody hurt you.
4425581 4427708 We could grow up<br />together, E.T.
4432688 4435418 Home.
4436692 4439320 Home.
4471393 4474556 Home.
4478567 4480762 Home.
4515271 4516465 E.T.?
4519775 4520969 E.T.?
4526615 4530574 Uh, how was he<br />dressed when
4530653 4533679 He was<br />dressed as a...
4533756 4535747 hunchback.
4535824 4537655 Hunchback.
4537726 4539660 Is there anything<br />to indicate
4539728 4541662 that he might<br />have run away?
4541730 4545666 Any family problems<br />or recent arguments?
4545734 4550171 Um... my husband and I<br />just separated recently,
4550239 4554869 and it hasn't been easy<br />on the children, but...
4554944 4557708 My father's<br />in Mexico.
4563452 4565386 But run away, I...
4565454 4567888 Where would he<br />have gone?
4567957 4569219 Elliott.
4569291 4571521 Oh, Elliott!
4571594 4577294 Don't ever do this<br />again, Elliott!
4577366 4579926 Oh, my. You're so hot.
4580002 4583403 Run up and draw him<br />a bath. Quick, Gert.
4583472 4586168 Sorry I yelled at you.
4588277 4591906 Um... thanks very much<br />for all your trouble.
4591981 4593744 Is he here?
4595784 4598252 You've got to<br />find him, Mike.
4598320 4599753 Where is he?
4599822 4602052 In the forest.
4602124 4604752 At the bald spot.
4604827 4606818 You've got<br />to find him.
4657112 4658909 E.T.!
4662117 4664085 E.T.!
4666455 4667945 E.T.!
4706595 4708222 No!
4708297 4709321 No!
4739628 4742290 Mom, would you<br />come with me?
4742364 4744195 What is it?
4744266 4746530 Mary,<br />just come with me.
4746602 4747830 Michael, what?
4747903 4749768 Mom, remember<br />the goblin?
4749838 4751738 What are you<br />talking about?
4751807 4754776 Swear the most<br />excellent promise
4754843 4755832 Michael.
4761850 4763613 That's terrific.
4769992 4772756 Mom.
4776832 4779494 We're sick.
4781403 4784497 I think we're dying.
4787409 4788398 Michael.
4788477 4789910 Mom, it's O.K.
4791914 4792846 Downstairs.
4792915 4796112 He's not going<br />to hurt you, Mom.
4796185 4797584 He won't hurt you.
4797653 4799280 Michael,<br />get her downstairs.
4799354 4801754 It's the man<br />from the moon.
4801824 4803849 The man<br />from the moon!
4806795 4809764 You don't know him!<br />You don't know him!
4814503 4816437 We can't<br />leave him alone.
4838961 4839950 Aah!
4855744 4858008 This is my home!
4906561 4908028 Home.
4910232 4911358 Home.
4935524 4937890 Check the north<br />perimeter.
4940362 4942956 Check the north<br />perimeter.
4945267 4948634 Is it fine?<br />Tent OK?
4951273 4952638 The collagen unit,
4952708 4955700 report to the blue level<br />immediately.
4963285 4966220 Regulate oxygen level<br />on countdown.
4987909 4989843 Does he sleep<br />at night?
4989911 4991378 I don't know.
4991446 4993380 What's the matter<br />with Elliott?
4993448 4995814 Have you noticed<br />any surface sweating?
4995884 4996816 No.
4996885 4998318 Has it lost hair?
4998387 5000355 He never<br />had any hair.
5000422 5002356 Are the children<br />all right?
5002424 5004824 Did it build<br />or write anything?
5004893 5006383 Uh, no.
5006461 5008895 You say it<br />has the ability
5008964 5010898 to manipulate<br />its own environment?
5010966 5013935 He's smart.<br />He communicates
5014002 5016994 Elliott thinks<br />its thoughts.
5017072 5018835 No. Elliott...
5018907 5021432 Elliott feels<br />his feelings.
5025514 5027675 We've identified<br />his primary carrier protein.
5027749 5029478 It's definitely not Albumin.
5029551 5032850 The testing shows no deficits<br />on FNF and HTS testing.
5032921 5035412 EEG analysis shows complete<br />coherence and synchronization
5035490 5037481 of brain wave activity<br />between both subjects.
5045167 5046828 There's no response<br />at 20 per kilo.
5046902 5048631 Let's move<br />to hypertonic saline.
5050138 5052129 Cut five per kilo.
5056511 5059878 You have no right<br />to do this.
5059948 5061438 You're scaring him.
5061516 5063609 You're scaring him!
5063885 5065045 Respiratory rate:12.
5065120 5067680 Good air entry but decreased<br />tidal volume on the boy.
5067756 5071988 Put him on 0-2-5 liters<br />and draw blood in 20 minutes.
5073595 5075460 Get a hypothermia blanket<br />and some warming rags.
5075530 5078499 Leave him alone.
5078567 5081434 Leave him alone.<br />I can take
5081503 5084131 Set me up for<br />a 2-D cardiac echo.
5084206 5086640 Skin is cool and diaphoretic.
5086708 5089643 He's not refusing at all.<br />He needs anatropic support.
5089711 5092009 Ph is down to 7.03.
5092080 5095641 He's got a metabolic acidosis.<br />It could be sepsis.
5096651 5098243 We've drawn two sets<br />of blood cultures.
5098320 5101483 He needs broad<br />spectrum coverage.
5108830 5110422 Elliott.
5112934 5114834 I've been<br />to the forest.
5114903 5117394 He shouldn't<br />talk now.
5117472 5120964 Well, he has to<br />talk now, Major.
5123311 5125438 Elliott,<br />that machine...
5125514 5129075 what does it do?
5129151 5132780 The communicator?
5132854 5135755 Is it still working?
5135824 5138884 It's doing something.
5138960 5140757 What?
5140829 5144128 I really<br />shouldn't tell.
5144199 5146633 He came to me.
5146701 5150102 He came to me.
5150172 5153608 Elliott,<br />he came to me, too.
5153675 5155609 I've been<br />wishing for this
5155677 5158111 since I was<br />10 years old.
5158180 5160614 I don't want him<br />to die.
5160682 5164277 What can we do that<br />we're not already doing?
5164352 5169085 He needs to go home.
5169157 5172752 He's calling<br />his people...
5172827 5177389 and I don't know<br />where they are.
5177465 5180161 He needs to go home.
5180235 5181998 Elliott, I don't think
5182070 5184766 that he was left here<br />intentionally.
5187242 5191144 But his being here<br />is a miracle, Elliott.
5191213 5194182 It's a miracle,
5194249 5197844 and you did the best<br />that anybody could do.
5200722 5203350 I'm glad<br />he met you first.
5212801 5213733 He's got DNA.
5213802 5215201 Incredible.
5215270 5216737 He's got DNA!
5216771 5219001 He doesn't have<br />four nucleotides like we do.
5219074 5221542 He has six.<br />Desynchronization
5224613 5225545 E.T.!

5281936 5283267 How's the boy?
5283338 5286705 He's converting back<br />to normal sinus rhythm.
5288143 5289075 They're separating.
5289144 5291442 Boy and creature<br />are separating.
5291513 5292946 What does<br />that mean?

5377966 5380901 We can't<br />get a pulse
5380969 5383335 It doesn't look<br />like he's breathing.
5385840 5387637 Leave him alone!
5387709 5389768 You're killing him!

5435657 5437215 All IV push.
5437292 5439055 He's not ventilating.
5439127 5442153 His pupils are fixed<br />and dilated.
5442230 5443197 More drugs.

5487942 5489637 Let's continue CPR,<br />please.
5505193 5507218 Would you people<br />stand back?
5512200 5514134 Something's<br />happening.
5514202 5516170 Ooh, they're<br />going to die.
5516237 5517636 Shut up, Greg.
5517705 5519570 Something is<br />definitely happening.

5527081 5528514 No. I don't know.
5528583 5530551 What time<br />do you have?
5530618 5531516 15:36.
5531586 5534111 15 hours,<br />36 minutes.

5535723 5537987 Let's pack him in ice.
5539527 5540858 Let's leave.
5606861 5610058 Is he dead, mama?
5610131 5612224 I think so,<br />sweetheart.
5612300 5616236 Can we wish<br />for him to come back?
5616304 5618238 Yeah.
5618306 5620433 I wish.

5637291 5638849 Cardiac arrest<br />was terminated
5638926 5642225 at 1500 hours<br />and 36 minutes.

5652807 5654274 And the<br />intravenous line
5654342 5657209 should be sent<br />for culture.

5659781 5663114 EEG and an EKG,
5663184 5665015 he was<br />defibrillated.
5665086 5668021 They're going to have<br />to take him away now.
5668089 5670523 They'll just<br />cut him all up.
5670591 5674618 Would you like<br />to spend some time
5689944 5693744 Could we all step out<br />for a minute, please?
5747335 5750327 Look at what<br />they've done to you.
5753207 5755141 I'm so sorry.
5760715 5763149 You must be dead...
5765119 5766279 because...
5766354 5769187 I don't know<br />how to feel.
5772727 5775252 I can't feel<br />anything anymore.
