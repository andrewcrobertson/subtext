35616 38616 OK... Here we go. Focus.
38688 41917 Speed. I am speed.
43552 46170 One winner, 42 losers.
46239 48694 I eat losers for breakfast.
50720 52094 Breakfast.
52159 54167 Wait, maybe I<br />should have had breakfast.
54239 57785 A little breck-y could be good for me.<br />No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
59423 61562 I'm faster than fast.<br />Quicker than quick.
61632 63159 I am lightning!
64256 66460 Hey, Lightning! You ready?
68031 71065 Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready
107775 108822 Ka-chow!
154079 155989 Get your antenna balls here!
162303 164376 Go, Lightnin'!
164448 168277 - Whoo!<br />- You got that right, slick.
181247 183157 Uh!
193215 195932 Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
195999 199479 I'm Bob Cutlass, here<br />with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.
199551 202421 <i>We're midway through what may<br />be an historic day for racing.</i>
202496 204438 <i>Bob, my oil pressure's<br />through the roof.</i>
204511 207959 <i>If this gets more exciting, they're<br />gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>
208031 209046 <i>Right, Darrell.</i>
209120 211640 <i>Three cars are tied<br />for the season points lead,</i>
211711 213718 <i>heading into the final race<br />of the season.</i>
213791 218363 <i>And the winner of this race will win<br />the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>
218431 220057 <i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>
220127 222429 <i>have one more victory in him<br />before retirement?</i>
222495 224983 <i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy<br />for years!</i>
225055 227160 <i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>
227231 230460 <i>And, as always, in the<br />second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>
230527 232949 <i>He's been chasing<br />that tailfin his entire career.</i>
233024 235096 <i>Chick thought<br />this was his year.</i>
235167 237818 <i>His chance to finally emerge<br />from The King's shadow.</i>
237887 241782 <i>But the last thing he expected was...<br />Lightning McQueen!</i>
241856 244376 <i>You know, I don't think<br />anybody expected this.</i>
244447 246967 <i>The rookie sensation<br />came into the season unknown.</i>
247039 248468 <i>But everyone knows him now.</i>
248543 252438 <i>Will he be the first rookie<br />to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>
252543 254998 <i>The legend, the runner-up,<br />and the rookie!</i>
255071 257821 <i>Three cars, one champion!</i>
269504 270933 No you don't.
273535 275445 Hey!
282143 283965 What a ride!
285312 287417 Go get 'em, McQueen!<br />Go get 'em!
291072 292828 I love you, Lightning!
292896 295449 Dinoco is all mine.
295520 297374 Trouble, turn three!
297440 300538 - Get through that, McQueen.<br />- Huge crash behind the leaders!
321535 324285 Wait a second, Darrell.<br />McQueen is in the wreckage.
324351 327068 There's no way the rookie<br />can make it through!
327135 328313 Not in one piece, that is.
342335 343961 Yeah!
344032 345919 Lightning! Oh!
347743 350110 Look at that!<br />McQueen made it through!
350175 352542 A spectacular move<br />by Lightning McQueen!
352607 354647 Yeah! Ka-chow!
354719 357850 McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!<br />McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
357919 360767 Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!
360831 362970 While everyone<br />heads into the pits,
363039 364730 McQueen stays out to take the lead!
364800 367669 Don't take me out, coach.<br />I can still race!
372224 374590 What do you think?<br />A thing of beauty.
374655 376510 - McQueen made it!<br />- What?
376575 377589 He's not pitting!
377663 380663 You gotta get me out there!<br />Let's go! Get me back out there!
380735 382426 McQueen's not going into the pits!
382495 385910 The rookie fired his<br />crew chief. The third this season!
385983 388187 - Says he likes working alone.<br />- Go, go!
388255 390394 Looks like Chick<br />got caught up in the pits.
390464 393725 Yeah, after a stop like that,<br />he's got a lot of ground to make up.
393791 396093 Get ready, boys,<br />we're coming to the restart!
413599 415258 Come on, come on, come on!
423295 425303 We need tires now!<br />Come on, let's go!
425375 427961 - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!<br />- What?
428095 430070 You need tires, you idiot!
430399 433246 Looks like it's<br />gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
433312 434686 Right. No tires again.
434751 437337 That's a short-term gain,<br />long-term loss,
437407 440920 but it's workin' for him. He obviously<br />knows somethin' we don't know.
448703 452762 This is it, Darrell. One lap to go<br />and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
452831 455580 He's got it in the bag.<br />Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
455647 457850 We're gonna crown us a new champion!
464063 466202 Checkered flag, here I come!
466271 468180 No! McQueen's blown a tire!
468255 470873 And with only one turn to go!<br />Can he make it?
470943 473398 You fool!
474719 477086 McQueen's blown a tire!<br />He's blown a tire!
477151 478580 Go, go, go!
487391 489049 He's lost another tire!
489119 492218 - King and Chick come up fast!<br />- They're entering turn three!
492287 494075 Come on.
495871 498009 I don't believe<br />what I'm watching, Bob!
498079 501462 Lightning McQueen<br />is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
506975 509463 The King and Chick<br />rounding turn four.
512223 515355 Down the stretch they come!<br />And it's, and it's...
515423 518106 - It's too close to call! Too close!<br />- I don't believe it!
518175 519484 Lightning!
519775 522644 - The most spectacular, amazing...<br />- I don't believe it!
522719 526035 ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending<br />in the history of the world!
526111 528053 - And we don't know who won!<br />- Look at that!
538303 541205 - That's very close to call.<br />- Can we play that again?
541279 543384 Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
543455 545886 <i>We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.</i>
545951 548318 <i>McQueen, that was a risky move,<br />not taking tires.</i>
548383 549331 <i>Tell me about it!</i>
549407 551960 <i>Are you sorry you didn't have<br />a crew chief out there?</i>
552031 555326 <i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing<br />than just winning.</i>
555391 559133 <i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...<br />Where's the entertainment in that?</i>
559199 561054 <i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>
561119 563159 <i>- Sizzle?<br />- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>
563231 565303 <i>No, I'm not.<br />'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>
565375 566749 <i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>
566815 568789 <i>That was a confident<br />Lightning McQueen.</i>
568863 571384 Live from Victory Lane,<br />I'm Kori Turbowitz.
571455 573080 - Get outta the shot.<br />- Yo, Chuck.
573151 574777 Chuck, what are you doing?<br />You're blockin' the camera!
574847 576756 - Everyone wants to see the bolt.<br />- What?
576831 580279 - Now, back away.<br />- That's it! Come on, guys.
580351 584245 - Whoa, team! Where are you going?<br />- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
584319 585945 Oh, OK, leave. Fine.
586015 589626 How will I ever find anyone else<br />who knows how to fill me up with gas?
590719 593501 - Adios, Chuck!<br />- And my name is not Chuck!
593567 595160 Oh, whatever.
595231 597173 Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!
597247 600411 Seriously, that was some<br />pretty darn nice racin' out there.
600479 602618 - By me!<br />- Oh, yeah.
602687 605108 - Zinger!<br />- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!
605183 607736 The Piston Cup...<br />It's mine, dude. It's mine.
607807 612182 Hey, fellas, how do you think<br />I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!
612255 614011 In your dreams, Thunder.
614079 617046 Yeah, right. Thunder?<br />What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
617119 619836 You know, 'cause thunder<br />always comes after lightning.
619903 621627 Ka-ping! Ka-pow!
621695 624029 - Who knew about the thunder thing?<br />- I didn't.
624095 625721 - Give us the bolt!<br />- That's right.
625791 627198 Right in the lens.
627359 629431 - Show me the bolt, baby!<br />- Smile, McQueen!
629503 632667 - Show me the bolt, McQueen!<br />- That's it!
637759 642036 That was one close finish.<br />You sure made Dinoco proud.
642111 643059 Thank you, King.
643135 645786 Well, Tex, you've been<br />good to me all these years.
645855 647164 It's the least I could do.
647231 650330 Whatever happens, you're a winner<br />to me, you old daddy rabbit.
650399 653082 Thanks, dear.<br />Wouldn't be nothing without you.
653151 654777 Kch-i-ka-chow!
655807 657400 - I'm Mia.<br />- I'm Tia.
657471 660602 We're, like, your biggest fans!<br />Ka-chow!
660671 663060 I love being me.
663135 666102 - OK, girls, that's it.<br />- We love you, Lightning!
667999 670716 Hey, buddy.<br />You're one gutsy racer.
670783 672277 Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
672351 674075 You got more talent in one lug nut
674143 676598 than a lot of cars has got<br />in their whole body.
676671 679159 - Really? Oh, that...<br />- But you're stupid.
679230 681686 - Excuse me?<br />- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.
681759 684726 You need to wise up and get<br />a good crew chief and a good team.
684799 687701 You ain't gonna win<br />unless you got good folks behind you,
687775 690938 and you let them<br />do their job, like they should.
691007 693625 - Like I tell the boys at the shop...<br />- A good team.
693695 695517 Yeah...
702974 704436 Ka-chow! Ka-pow!
723423 725333 Oh, Lightning!
726719 729436 If you figure that out<br />you just gonna be OK.
729502 732983 Oh, yeah, that...<br />That is spectacular advice.
733055 734429 Thank you, Mr. The King.
734495 736502 Ladies and gentlemen,
736574 738713 for the first time<br />in Piston Cup history...
738783 742329 A rookie<br />has won the Piston Cup.
742719 743734 Yes!
743806 746621 ...we have a three-way tie.
753183 755933 Hey,<br />that must be really embarrassing.
755999 758552 But I wouldn't worry about it.<br />Because I didn't do it!
759583 762844 Piston Cup officials<br />have determined that a tiebreaker race
762911 766969 between the three leaders<br />will be held in California in one week.
767198 770330 Well, thank you! Thanks to<br />all of you out there! Thank you!
770399 773944 Hey, first one to<br />California gets Dinoco all to himself.
774014 776862 No, not me!<br />No, you rock, and you know that!
780894 783098 Oh, yeah! Whoo!
784959 786169 Yep! All right! Got it!
786239 789556 "First one to California<br />gets Dinoco all to himself. "
789630 792151 Oh, we'll see<br />who gets there first, Chick.
792223 793270 Huh?
793343 796539 - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.<br />- I don't want to talk about it.
796606 799356 Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.<br />What'd you do with my trailer?
799423 801528 - I parked it at your sponsor's tent.<br />- What?
801599 803509 Gotta make your personal appearance.
803582 806038 No. No! No, no, no, no!
806175 808476 <i>Yes, yes, yes!<br />Lightning McQueen here.</i>
808543 812023 <i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>
812095 815641 <i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper<br />like Rust-eze.</i>
816031 818365 <i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>
818430 822009 <i>Use Rust-eze and you too<br />can look like me!</i>
822079 823289 <i>Ka-chow!</i>
825919 828340 I met this car from Swampscott.
828415 831350 He was so rusty<br />he didn't even cast a shadow.
831422 834172 You could see his dirty undercarriage.
834239 838298 I hate rusty cars.<br />This is not good for my image.
838367 841629 They did give you your big break.<br />Besides, it's in your contract.
841695 844477 Oh, will you stop, please?<br />Just go get hooked up.
844543 848340 - Winter is a grand old time.<br />- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
848415 850749 But remember,<br />all that salt and grime...
850814 852702 Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
852767 854654 Hey, look! There he is!
854719 856606 Our almost champ!
856671 858264 Get your rear end in here.
858335 860277 Lightning McQueen,<br />you are wicked fast!
860351 862423 - That race was a pisser!<br />- You were booking!
862494 864469 - Give me a little room.<br />- You're my hero!
864543 866299 Yes, I know.
866367 867861 "Fred. " Fred, thank you.
867998 870420 He knows my name.<br />He knows my name!
871230 872375 Looking good, Freddie!
872446 874813 Thanks to you, Lightning,<br />we had a banner year!
874878 877300 We might clear enough<br />to buy you some headlights.
877375 879317 You saying he doesn't have headlights?
879391 881627 That's what I'm telling ya.<br />They're stickers!
881694 884564 Well, you know,<br />racecars don't need headlights,
884639 886548 because the track is always lit.
886623 889689 Yeah, well, so is my brother,<br />but he still needs headlights.
894399 898011 - Ladies and gentlemen,<br />- Lightning McQueen!
900863 902717 Free Bird!
902783 905979 You know, the Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment team
906046 907835 ran a great race today.
908222 910459 And remember, with a little Rust-eze...
910559 912631 And an insane<br />amount of luck,
912703 917046 ...you too, can look like me.<br />Ka-chow.
919582 920989 - Hey, kid.<br />- We love ya.
921054 923421 And we're looking forward<br />to another great year.
923486 924730 Just like this year!
926079 928446 Not on your life.
928671 932086 - Don't drive like my brother!<br />- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!
932159 935029 <i>California, here we come!</i>
935135 937688 Dinoco, here we come!
1041470 1046773 Oh... oh... uh,<br />I needed this. Hello?

1382399 1384820 Oh, maybe he can help me!
1384894 1387065 He's shooting at me!<br />Why is he shooting at me?
1388190 1390362 I haven't gone this fast in years.
1390431 1393148 I'm gonna<br />blow a gasket or somethin'.
1393214 1395450 Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!
1395518 1397144 What in the blue blazes?
1397214 1398675 Crazy hot-rodder.
1457182 1461589 I'm telling you, man,<br />every third blink is slower.
1465919 1468471 The sixties weren't good to you,<br />were they?
1477534 1480568 What? That's not the Interstate!

1498718 1500343 - Incoming!<br />- Whoa, man.
1500414 1501691 - No!<br />- Hey!
1502686 1503930 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1504862 1506073 My tires!
1549854 1552952 Fly away, Stanley. Be free!
1562238 1565533 Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.
1568830 1571448 <i>We're live at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway</i>
1571518 1573940 <i>as the first competitor,<br />Lightning McQueen,</i>
1574014 1576218 <i>is arriving at the track.</i>
1576286 1578141 <i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>
1578206 1579318 <i>What's your strategy?</i>
1581278 1583863 <i>What? Did I forget<br />to wipe my mud flaps?</i>
1585342 1588571 <i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,<br />but McQueen was missing.</i>
1588638 1592435 <i>- McQueen was reported missing.<br />- ... to race an unprecedented...</i>
1592510 1594965 <i>Sponsor stated<br />they have no idea where he is.</i>
1597790 1601139 I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate<br />to see anything bad happen to him.
1601214 1605240 <i>I don't know what's harder to find,<br />McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>
1605310 1608277 <i>Lightning McQueen<br />must be found at all costs!</i>
1608350 1612147 <i>They're all asking the same question:<br />Where is McQueen?</i>
1613086 1615159 Oh, boy.
1616126 1618166 Where am I?
1618302 1620724 - Mornin', sleepin' beauty!<br />- Ah!
1621406 1623795 Boy, I was wonderin'<br />when you was gonna wake up.
1623870 1626455 Take whatever you want!<br />Just don't hurt me!
1626718 1629303 A parking boot?<br />Why do I have a parking boot on?
1629373 1634130 - What's going on here? Please!<br />- You're funny.
1634206 1637141 I like you already. My name's Mater.
1638590 1639538 Mater?
1639614 1642429 Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"<br />but without the "tuh".
1642494 1645625 - What's your name?<br />- You don't know my name?
1645693 1646642 Uh...
1646718 1649979 No, I know your name.<br />Is your name Mater too?
1650046 1651028 What?
1651101 1655673 Look, I need to get to California<br />as fast as possible. Where am I?
1655742 1657914 Where are you? Shoot!
1657982 1659476 You're in Radiator Springs.
1659550 1662811 The cutest little town<br />in Carburetor County.
1662878 1665627 Oh, great. Just great!
1665694 1670037 Well, if you think that's great,<br />you should see the rest of the town.
1670110 1673754 You know,<br />I'd love to see the rest of the town!
1673950 1676667 So if you could just open the gate,<br />take this boot off,
1676734 1679352 you and me, we go cruisin',<br />check out the local scene...
1679422 1681561 - Dad-gum!<br />- How'd that be, Tuhmater?
1681630 1683091 - Cool!<br />- Mater!
1683166 1685916 What did I tell you<br />about talkin' to the accused?
1685982 1687411 To not to.
1687486 1691741 Well, quit your yappin' and tow this<br />delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
1691806 1693813 Well, we'll talk later, Mater.
1693886 1696636 "Later, Mater. "<br />That's funny!
1696894 1697842 Ah!
1697918 1701464 The Radiator Springs<br />Traffic Court will come to order!
1701534 1704916 Hey, you scratched my paint!<br />I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!
1704990 1707292 You broke-a the road!<br />You a very bad car!
1707358 1708340 - Fascist!<br />- Commie!
1708414 1710999 Officer, talk to me, babe.<br />How long is this gonna take?
1711070 1712761 I gotta get to California, pronto.
1712830 1713943 Where's your lawyer?
1714014 1717145 I don't know. Tahiti maybe.<br />He's got a timeshare there.
1717214 1722135 When a defendant has no lawyer,<br />the court will assign one to him. Hey!
1722206 1724115 Anyone want to be his lawyer?
1725438 1727674 Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
1727742 1731354 All rise! The Honorable<br />Doc Hudson presiding.
1731678 1732758 Show-off.
1732830 1736026 May Doc have mercy on your soul.
1736094 1737239 All right,
1737310 1740309 I wanna know who's responsible<br />for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.
1740381 1742204 I want his hood on a platter!
1742270 1744823 I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!<br />No, check that.
1744894 1748505 I'm gonna put him in jail till<br />the jail rots on top of him,
1748574 1752086 and then I'm gonna move him<br />to a new jail and let that jail rot.
1752157 1753619 I'm...
1755518 1757373 Throw him out of here, Sheriff.
1757438 1760667 I want him out of my courtroom.<br />I want him out of our town!
1760797 1762324 - Case dismissed.<br />- Yes!
1762398 1764569 Boy, I'm purty good<br />at this lawyerin' stuff.
1764637 1766044 Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!
1767038 1770867 Holy Porsche! She's gotta be<br />from my attorney's office.
1770942 1773309 Hey, thanks for comin',<br />but we're all set.
1773373 1775708 - He's letting me go.<br />- He's letting you go?
1775774 1777629 Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.
1777694 1780727 All you have to do now is stand there<br />and let me look at you.
1780798 1784213 Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.<br />Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!
1784606 1786166 - What the...? Ow! Oh!<br />- Ka-chow!
1786238 1789173 - Please!<br />- I know. I get that reaction a lot.
1789310 1792692 I create feelings in others that<br />they themselves don't understand.
1792766 1794359 Agh! Ow!
1794430 1796732 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
1796798 1798740 A little bit, but I'll be all right.
1798814 1802426 OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
1802494 1804981 Do what you gotta do, baby.<br />But listen. Be careful.
1805053 1808599 Folks around here are not firing on<br />all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
1808701 1810589 Ka-ching!
1810654 1811701 Ah!
1811838 1813692 I'll keep that in mind.
1813853 1816155 - Hey there, Mater.<br />- Howdy, Sally.
1816510 1818714 - Hi, folks!<br />- Good morning!
1819422 1820370 You know her?
1820446 1823293 She's the town attorney and my fiancée.
1823358 1824306 What?
1824382 1828310 Nah, I'm just kiddin'.<br />She just likes me for my body.
1828382 1832059 You look great. You do something<br />different with your side view mirrors?
1832126 1833719 What do you want, Sally?
1833790 1837019 Come on, make this guy<br />fix the road. The town needs this.
1837085 1840119 No. I know his type. Racecar.
1840190 1842164 That's the last thing this town needs.
1842238 1846548 OK, I didn't want to have to do this,<br />Doc, but you leave me no choice.
1846622 1850397 Fellow citizens, you're all aware<br />of our town's proud history.
1850462 1851836 Here she goes again.
1851901 1854487 Radiator Springs,<br />the glorious jewel
1854558 1858038 strung on the necklace<br />of Route 66, the mother road!
1858109 1861754 It is our job and our pleasure<br />to take care of the travelers
1861822 1864691 - on our stretch of that road.<br />- Travelers? What travelers?
1864766 1865878 Ignore him.
1865949 1869179 But how, I ask you,<br />are we to care for those travelers
1869246 1871482 if there is no road<br />for them to drive on?
1871549 1874233 - Luigi, what do you have at your store?<br />- Tires.
1874302 1875731 And if no one can get to you?
1875806 1879962 I won't sell any... tires.<br />I will lose everything!
1880030 1882747 - Flo, what do you have at your store?<br />- I have gas.
1882813 1886075 - Lotsa gas!<br />- OK boys, stay with me.
1886142 1889525 And, Flo, what'll happen if no one<br />can come to your station to buy gas?
1889597 1892946 I'll go outta business and...<br />we'll have to leave town.
1893021 1896021 What's gonna happen if Flo<br />leaves town and closes her station?
1896094 1898549 - Without gas, we're done for!<br />- What?
1898622 1901339 Don't you think the car responsible<br />should fix our road?
1901405 1904504 The only guy strong enough<br />to fix that road is Big Al!
1904574 1906712 Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.
1906782 1908724 Then why are you bringing<br />him up, you lemon?
1908797 1909746 Oh, he can do it.
1909822 1912505 He's got the horsepower.<br />So, what do you want him to do?
1912573 1913980 Fix the road!
1914045 1917460 - Because we are a town worth fixing!<br />- Yeah!
1918814 1921880 Order in the court!
1922622 1925273 Seems like my mind<br />has been changed for me.
1925342 1927251 - Yeah!<br />- No!
1927325 1928602 Nice ruling.
1929309 1932658 Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.
1932733 1936443 That's OK, Stickers.<br />You can take Bessie.
1936637 1938263 Man, you get to work with Bessie!
1938334 1940854 I'd give my left two lug nuts<br />for somethin' like that.
1940925 1943478 Bessie? Who's Bessie?
1945598 1949395 This here is Bessie,<br />finest road-pavin' machine ever built.
1949469 1952404 I'm hereby sentencing you<br />to community service.
1952478 1955096 You're gonna fix the road<br />under my supervision.
1955165 1957402 What? This place is crazy!
1957470 1959542 I know this may be<br />a bad time right now,
1959613 1962483 but you owe me $32,000<br />in legal fees.
1962557 1963506 What?
1963582 1966997 We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,<br />and you're gonna pull her nice.
1967070 1968596 You gotta be kidding me.
1968669 1971222 You start there where the road begins.
1971582 1974451 You finish down there<br />where the road ends.
1976349 1978521 Holy shoot!
1979038 1981339 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />How long is this gonna take?
1981405 1984821 Well, fella does it right,<br />should take him about five days.
1984893 1986006 Five days?
1986078 1988893 But I should be in California<br />schmoozing Dinoco right now!
1988958 1991805 Then if I were you,<br />I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!
1991869 1994258 - Hook him up, Mater.<br />- Okay-dokey.
2002013 2004152 Freedom!
2009245 2012628 Maybe I should've<br />hooked him up to Bessie...
2013373 2016537 ...and then...<br />then took the boot off.
2017950 2020251 Whoo-hoo!
2020957 2024787 Goodbye, Radiator Springs,<br />and goodbye, Bessie!
2024861 2028571 California, here I come! Yeah!
2030846 2032755 Oh, feel that wind.
2033181 2034708 Yes!
2035838 2037780 No. No, no, no.
2038078 2040282 No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?
2040350 2042259 How can I be outta gas?
2042333 2046130 Boy, we ain't<br />as dumb as you think we are.
2046206 2048442 But how did,<br />how did... you...?
2048509 2050746 We siphoned your gas<br />while you were passed out.
2050813 2053595 - Ka-chow.<br />- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
2061662 2063963 - Gentlemen.<br />- Sheriff.
2064030 2065077 Hey, Sheriff.
2065150 2067321 <i>- Why here?<br />- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>
2067389 2069778 <i>- They were better before.<br />- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>
2069854 2071642 - Guido!<br />- Red, can you move over?
2071710 2074427 I want to get a look<br />at that sexy hot rod.
2074494 2077211 You know, I used to be<br />a purty good whistler.
2077278 2079896 I can't do it now, of course,<br />on account of sometimes
2079965 2082747 I get fluid built up<br />in my engine block,
2082813 2086042 but Doc said he's gonna fix it.<br />He can fix about anything.
2086110 2088248 That's why we made him the judge.
2088413 2092407 <i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on<br />Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>
2092478 2093787 Now, I'm not one to brag
2093854 2097018 but people come purty far<br />to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
2097469 2098451 Oh!
2098525 2101242 - Aw, man, that's just great!<br />- Hey, what's wrong?
2101309 2103033 My lucky sticker's all dirty.
2103102 2105273 Ah, that ain't nothin'.<br />I'll clean it for ya.
2105341 2109848 No, no, no!
2109918 2112154 That won't be necessary.
2113181 2116345 Hey! Hey, big fella!<br />Yeah, you in the red!
2116413 2118934 I could use a little hose down.<br />Help me wash this off.
2121278 2122226 Where's he goin'?
2122302 2125597 Oh, he's a little bit shy, and<br />he hates you for killin' his flowers.
2125661 2127123 I shouldn't put up with this.
2127198 2129947 I'm a precision instrument<br />of speed and aerodynamics.
2130013 2132916 - You hurt your what?<br />- I'm a very famous racecar!
2133181 2136247 You are a famous racecar?<br />A real racecar?
2136317 2138838 Yes, I'm a real racecar.<br />What do you think? Look at me.
2138910 2142739 I have followed racing my entire life.<br />My whole life!
2142814 2145018 Then you know who I am.<br />I'm Lightning McQueen.
2145086 2147093 - Lightning McQueen?<br />- Yes! Yes!
2147165 2149074 I must scream it to the world!
2149149 2153208 My excitement from the top<br />of someplace very high!
2153278 2155667 - Do you know many Ferraris?<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2155742 2158589 They race on the European circuit.<br />I'm in the Piston Cup!
2159326 2162140 - What?<br />- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
2166814 2169269 Is that what I think it is?
2170781 2171992 Customers.
2172062 2175378 Customers!<br />Customers, everyone! Customers!
2175454 2176763 - OK!<br />- Customers?
2176829 2179546 Been a long time.<br />Remember what we rehearsed.
2179613 2182068 Make sure your<br />"Open, please come in" signs are out.
2182141 2185524 You all know what to do.<br />All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
2185597 2188150 Van, I just don't see<br />any on-ramp anywhere.
2188221 2192444 - Minny, I know exactly where we are.<br />- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
2192509 2195062 - Honey, please.<br />- Hello.
2195133 2197981 Welcome to Radiator Springs,<br />gateway to Ornament Valley.
2198045 2200216 Legendary for<br />its service and hospitality.
2200285 2201267 How can we help you?
2201341 2205236 - We don't need anything, thank you.<br />- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
2205310 2208408 There's no need to ask for directions.<br />I know where we're going.
2208477 2210812 He did the same thing<br />on our trip to Shakopee.
2210878 2213595 We were headed over there<br />for the Crazy Days, and we...
2213661 2216596 - OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?<br />- What you really need
2216669 2220564 is the sweet taste<br />of my homemade, organic fuel.
2220637 2222263 No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
2222334 2225400 - Just trying to find the Interstate.<br />- Good to see you, soldier!
2225470 2228666 Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut<br />for your government surplus needs.
2228733 2230970 - Honey, surplus!<br />- We have too much surplus.
2231038 2233274 I do have a map<br />over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
2233341 2236375 And if you stay, we offer a free<br />Lincoln Continental breakfast.
2236445 2240023 - Honey, she's got a map.<br />- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.
2240093 2243409 - Never need a map again, thank you.<br />- How 'bout somethin' to drink?
2243485 2247260 Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.<br />Finest fuel on Route 66.
2247325 2248438 No we just topped off.
2248510 2252219 And if you need tires,<br />stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,
2252285 2254652 home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
2254717 2257914 - We're trying to find the Interstate.<br />- But you do need a paint job.
2257981 2261014 Ramone will paint you up right.<br />Hey, anything you want!
2261085 2263289 - You know, like a flame job.<br />- No thanks...
2263357 2264634 Maybe ghost flames!
2264701 2267156 You like old school pinstripin'?<br />Von Dutch style?
2267229 2270971 Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
2271037 2273939 OK, no.<br />We're gonna be going now, OK?
2274013 2275442 Ow!

2278813 2280821 - OK!<br />- Come back soon, OK?
2280893 2284242 I mean, you know where we are!<br />Tell your friends!
2285789 2287764 OK! Yes. You bet.
2287837 2290008 Thanks again, folks.<br />Bye-bye now.
2290077 2293045 Psst! Psst!<br />Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
2293117 2295190 - I know how to get to the Interstate!<br />- Do ya?
2295261 2297814 - Minny, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2297885 2299292 No, not really. But listen.
2299357 2302837 I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.<br />I'm being held against my will.
2302909 2305331 I need you to call my team,<br />so they can come rescue me
2305406 2309083 and get me to California in time for me<br />to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
2310013 2312184 <i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>
2312253 2315963 No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!<br />You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
2316029 2319062 I'm in hillbilly hell!<br />My IQ's dropping by the second!
2319133 2321141 I'm becoming one of them!
2322942 2324981 OK, don't worry.<br />They know where we are now.
2325053 2326744 They'll tell friends. You'll see.
2326813 2329563 <i>We'll be back<br />for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>
2329629 2332247 <i>- That's good.<br />- ... after a Piston Cup update.</i>
2332317 2336059 <i>Still no sign of Lightning<br />McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>
2336126 2339442 <i>and today became the first car<br />to spend practice time on the track.</i>
2339518 2342551 <i>It's nice to get out here<br />before the other competitors.</i>
2342621 2346233 <i>You know, get a head start.<br />Gives me an edge.</i>
2349533 2351256 Hoo-hoo-hoo!
2356125 2357074 Ha-ha!
2360765 2361714 Yeah!
2372862 2375098 Hey, McQueen...<br />Eat your heart out.
2375549 2377305 Oh!
2377373 2378682 Let me get this straight.
2378749 2381564 I can go when this road is done.<br />That's the deal, right?
2381629 2385207 - That's what they done did said.<br />- OK. Outta my way.
2385277 2386325 I got a road to finish.
2397693 2399995 - He's done!<br />- Done?
2400061 2402330 - Uh-huh.<br />- It's only been an hour.
2404190 2407386 Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
2407453 2410203 Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.<br />That's all you gotta say.
2410781 2414294 Whee-hoo!<br />I'm the first one on the new road!
2414845 2416372 Oh!
2417661 2420247 It rides purty smooth.
2420477 2423793 - It looks awful!<br />- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
2423901 2427250 Oh!
2427613 2429523 Red.
2432030 2433306 Who do you think you are?
2433373 2436537 Look, Doc said when I finish,<br />I could go. That was the deal.
2436605 2439900 The deal was you fix the road,<br />not make it worse.
2439965 2442332 Now, scrape it off!<br />Start over again.
2442397 2445877 Hey, look, grandpa,<br />I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
2445949 2447378 Oh-ho-ho-ho!
2447453 2451511 Is that right? Then why don't we<br />just have a little race? Me and you.
2451581 2455226 - What?<br />- Me and you. That a joke?
2455293 2457562 If you win, you go and I fix the road.
2457629 2460215 If I win, you do the road my way.
2460285 2461746 Doc, what're you doin'?
2462109 2463865 I don't mean to be rude here,
2463933 2467511 but you probably go zero to sixty in,<br />like, what? Three-point-five years?
2467581 2470003 Then I reckon<br />you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
2470078 2474550 You know what, old-timer?<br />That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
2476221 2478643 Gentlemen,<br />this will be a one-lap race.
2478718 2483027 You will drive to Willy's Butte,<br />go around Willy's Butte and come back.
2483101 2485916 There will be no bumpin',<br />no cheatin', no spittin',
2485981 2488403 no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
2488477 2493398 no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',<br />no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
2493469 2495160 and no lollygaggin'.
2495229 2496723 Speed. I'm speed.
2496797 2499252 Float like a Cadillac,<br />sting like a Beemer.
2500445 2505049 My friend Guido, he dream to give<br />a real racecar a pit stop.
2505117 2507539 - Peet stop!<br />- Uh...
2507613 2510363 The race is only one lap, guys.
2510429 2512818 <i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>
2512893 2516570 <i>- I work solo mio.<br />- Fine. Race your way.</i>
2517821 2521531 - No pit stoppo. Comprendo?<br />- OK.
2521629 2523538 Gentlemen...
2524157 2526874 ...start your engines!
2533373 2535642 <i>- Hijole! Check that out!<br />- Whoa.</i>
2535709 2538677 Great idea, Doc.<br />Now the road will never get done.
2539037 2540281 Luigi?
2540349 2543415 On your mark, get set...
2543485 2545624 <i>Uno for the money,<br />due for the show,</i>
2545693 2551160 <i>tre to get ready, and quattro<br />to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>
2559293 2560570 Huh?
2561181 2563602 Doc... the flag means go.
2563677 2566873 Remember the fl...<br />Here we go. Go.
2566941 2569559 Doc, what are you doing, man?
2569629 2573044 Oh, dear. It would seem<br />I'm off to a poor start.
2573117 2576117 Well, better late than never.<br />Come on, Mater.
2576189 2578839 - Might need a little help.<br />- Uh... OK.
2580477 2581852 You got your tow cable?
2581917 2584022 Well, yeah,<br />I always got my tow cable. Why?
2584093 2586297 Oh, just in case.
2594493 2596598 Ow! Ow!<br />Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
2596669 2598327 No, no, no, no, no!
2598461 2600763 - Oh, man!<br />- Whoa.
2601469 2603673 - Ow!<br />- Bad trip, man.
2606717 2612467 Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac<br />or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
2612541 2614810 I'm confused.
2614877 2616884 You drive like you fix roads.
2616957 2620023 Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
2623677 2625433 Ah!
2626141 2628989 I'm startin' to think he knowed<br />you was gonna crash!
2629053 2632053 Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
2635037 2636892 I can make a little turn on dirt.
2636957 2638332 You think?
2638397 2642674 No. And now I'm a day behind.<br />I'm never gonna get outta here!
2642749 2645116 <i>Hey, ése!<br />You need a new paint job, man!</i>
2645181 2648028 - No, thank you.<br />- How 'bout some organic fuel?
2648093 2650362 - That freak juice?<br />- Pass.
2650429 2654706 Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.<br />Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
2654781 2656308 Nah, not me, Flo.
2656381 2658748 I'm on one of them there special diets.
2658813 2663221 I'm a precisional instrument<br />of speed and aero-matics.
2663773 2665944 "You race like you fix roads. "
2666013 2670585 I'll show him.<br />I will show him!
2678589 2682746 Oh, great! I hate it!
2682813 2686293 - Hate, hate, hate, hate it!<br />- Music. Sweet music.
2687453 2689908 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
2689981 2692599 Radiator Springs, a happy place!
2692669 2695571 OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?
2698013 2701657 Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!<br />I'm talking to Bessie!
2714172 2715187 Wow.
2715517 2717143 Mornin', Sally!
2717213 2722199 Hey, look at this here fancy new road<br />that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
2722269 2724211 Yes! Uh, amazing!
2724669 2728149 Whoa-ho! Yeah!
2728220 2732246 Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't<br />seen you that low in years.
2732316 2734772 I haven't seen a road like this<br />in years.
2734844 2738805 - Well, then let's cruise, baby.<br />- Low and slow.
2738877 2740982 <i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>
2741052 2744631 Guido, look, it's-a like<br />it was paved by angels.
2745533 2746777 Boy, I tell you what.
2746845 2749562 I bet even the roads on the moon<br />ain't this smooth.
2749629 2751222 Doc, look at this!
2751357 2754107 Shoulda tossed him into<br />the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
2754173 2757522 Well, he ain't finished yet.<br />Still got a long way to go.
2757597 2760444 Guido, look at Luigi!
2761021 2762679 <i>This is fantastico!</i>
2762749 2766065 That looks like fun!<br />Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
2766141 2770265 Hey, Luigi, this new road<br />makes your place look like a dump.
2770909 2773495 That crazy old devil woman.
2773948 2777210 Oh!
2777277 2779033 She's right!
2779100 2780595 - Ah!<br />- Guido!
2780668 2784280 Huh. That punk actually did a good job.
2785501 2789145 Well, now... where the heck is he?
2795229 2797847 Sheriff!<br />Is he makin' another run for it?
2797917 2801146 No, no. He ran outta asphalt<br />in the middle of the night,
2801213 2803482 and asked me if he could<br />come down here.
2803549 2805851 All he's tryin' to do<br />is make that there turn.
2805917 2808634 No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
2809085 2811506 Perfect turns on every track<br />I've ever raced on.
2813629 2817426 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself<br />a quart of oil at Flo's.
2817500 2818842 I'll keep an eye on him.
2818909 2822651 Well, thanks, Doc.<br />I've been feelin' a quart low.
2836444 2838811 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
2838876 2841495 Oh, great. What do you want?<br />You here to gloat?
2841565 2844761 You don't have three-wheel brakes,<br />so you got to pitch it hard,
2844829 2848178 break it loose and then<br />just drive it with the throttle.
2848253 2851188 Give it too much, you'll be<br />outta the dirt and into the tulips.
2851260 2854228 So you're a judge,<br />a doctor and a racing expert.
2854301 2855894 I'll put it simple.
2855965 2859958 If you're goin' hard enough left,<br />you'll find yourself turnin' right.
2860989 2866172 Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.<br />Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
2866237 2867960 Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
2868028 2871476 Because in Opposite World,<br />maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
2874173 2877435 Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
2884765 2886619 Turn right to go left.
2887836 2889746 Hmm...
2889821 2890835 Whoa!
2892157 2894491 Oh!
2894941 2898738 Ow! Oh, that...
2900253 2903482 Ow!
2904860 2907991 Turn right to go left.<br />Guess what. I tried it.
2908061 2911028 You know what? This crazy thing<br />happened... I went right!
2911101 2914362 You keep talkin' to yourself,<br />people'll think you're crazy.
2914429 2918203 - Thanks for the tip.<br />- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
2924797 2928212 <i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!<br />- Che cosa?</i>
2928285 2932475 <i>- It looks great! This is great!<br />- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>
2934972 2936882 Oh, Lord.
2936956 2938517 Mater!
2938589 2940661 I need you<br />to watch the prisoner tonight.
2940732 2943896 Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.<br />What if he tries to run again?
2943964 2946681 Just let him run outta gas<br />and tow him on back.
2946748 2949115 - But keep an eye on him.<br />- Yes, sir!
2950173 2951766 Oh...
2951837 2954390 While I'm stuck here<br />paving this stinkin' road,
2954461 2956916 Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
2956989 2960120 My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />Who's touching me?
2960188 2962392 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
2962460 2964402 You make-a such a nice new road.
2964477 2967030 You come to my shop.<br />Luigi take-a good care of you.
2967101 2968628 Even though you not a Ferrari.
2968701 2972629 You buy four tires,<br />I give you a full-a size spare
2972701 2976410 - absolutely free!<br />- Look, I get all my tires for free.
2976477 2979859 I like your style, eh?
2979933 2983348 You drive the hard bargain.<br />OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
2983421 2986737 You buy one tire,<br />I give you three for free!
2986812 2988405 Oh, would you look at that?
2988477 2990517 Ramone, Ramone!
2990589 2992596 Then Luigi make you<br />a new new deal.
2992669 2995538 No, no, no, no.<br />Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
2995612 2999093 - No, no, no, no. No.<br />- This is it. My last offer.
2999165 3003671 You buy one tire, I give you<br />seven-a snow tires for free!
3003740 3006490 Done. You interested, you call me.<br />You know where I am.
3007836 3008949 Ah!
3009021 3011060 Stop! Let me...
3012413 3015130 Oh, Red, you missed a spot.<br />See it right there?
3015197 3017139 - No! No!<br />- On the hood right there.
3017213 3020409 Stop, stop! That's cold!
3020476 3022865 Help! Please! Stop!
3022940 3026169 Thanks, Red.
3027356 3028567 What was that for?
3028637 3030677 - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?<br />- Huh?
3030749 3032178 If you do, you gotta be clean.
3032252 3034674 'Cause even in hillbilly hell<br />we have standards.
3034749 3036407 What, I...? I don't get it.
3036477 3038965 I thought I'd say thank you<br />for doin' a great job.
3039037 3042135 So I thought I'd let you stay with me.<br />I mean, not with me!
3042204 3046645 But there. Not with me there,<br />but there in your own cozy cone.
3046717 3050426 - And I'd be in my cone, and it's...<br />- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
3050492 3052794 If you want to stay<br />at the dirty impound, fine.
3052860 3055992 - I understand you criminal types.<br />- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
3056061 3059127 - Yeah, the Cozy Cone.<br />- It's newly refurbished.
3059197 3062513 Yeah,<br />it's like a clever little twist.
3062589 3066550 The motel's made out of caution cones,<br />which, of course, cars try to avoid.
3066621 3069850 But now we're gonna stay in them.<br />That's funny.
3071292 3073431 Figure that all out on your own,<br />did you?
3074365 3076732 Cone number one, if you want.
3077789 3080058 Oh...
3081148 3084726 Hey, do I spy a little<br />pinstriping tattoo back there?
3084796 3087764 Oh...<br />That's just a... Oh!
3090237 3093433 Oh, you saw that? Yeah.<br />Just gonna be going.
3093501 3096021 Gonna... Yeah.
3100572 3103060 You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
3103132 3104561 Good-lookin' girl.
3104637 3107801 Looked just like a Jaguar,<br />only she was a truck!
3107869 3111218 You know, I used to crash into her,<br />just so I could spoke to her.
3112284 3114651 - What are you talking about?<br />- I don't know.
3114716 3118677 Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,<br />'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
3118748 3122742 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,<br />and I have to get out of here.
3122813 3126228 Well, that's all right,<br />Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
3126301 3128505 You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
3128573 3130263 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
3130332 3133202 You know who you're talkin' to?<br />This is Lightning McQueen.
3133277 3135513 I can handle anything.
3135580 3140217 - I'm not doin' this.<br />- Come on. You'll love it!
3140476 3143859 - Tractor-tippin's fun.<br />- This is ridiculous.
3143933 3146267 All right, listen.
3146332 3150162 When I say go, we go.<br />But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

3360143 3363886 Yeah, you probably right.<br />Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
3363952 3366570 Where, where?
3366640 3369128 - You're in love with Miss Sally.<br />- No, I'm not.
3369200 3371272 - Yes, you do.<br />- No way.

3383983 3387147 Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.<br />You're gonna wreck.
3387215 3391917 Wreck? Shoot!<br />I'm the world's best backwards driver!
3391984 3394983 You just watch this right here,<br />lover boy. Wee-hee!

3432751 3434410 Just need to know where I've been.
3434480 3437479 Whoa, that was incredible!<br />How'd you do that?
3437551 3441381 Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,<br />and I'll teach you if you want.
3441456 3444554 Yeah,<br />maybe I'll use it in my big race.
3444623 3448006 What's so important<br />about this race of yours, anyway?
3449455 3453033 It's not just a race.<br />We're talking about the Piston Cup!
3453103 3455340 I've been dreaming about it<br />my whole life!
3455408 3458310 I'll be the first rookie in history<br />ever to win it.
3458384 3461799 And when I do,<br />we're talkin' big new sponsor,
3461872 3463465 with private helicopters.
3463536 3466667 No more medicated bumper ointment.<br />No more rusty old cars.
3466735 3468775 What's wrong with rusty old cars?
3470512 3473992 Well, I don't mean you, Mater.<br />I mean other old cars. You know?
3474063 3477096 - Not like you. I like you.<br />- It's OK, buddy.
3477423 3481930 Hey, you think maybe one day I can<br />get a ride in one of them helicopters?
3481999 3486407 I mean, I've always wanted to ride<br />in one of them fancy helicopters.
3486480 3489163 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.<br />- You mean it?
3489231 3490922 Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

3546704 3549354 Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got<br />a kick out of that, didn't he?

3565007 3567592 - Did you mean that?<br />- What?
3567663 3573065 Was it just a "Yeah, OK",<br />or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?
3573136 3575689 Look, I'm exhausted.<br />It's kinda been a long day.
3576399 3579116 Yeah, OK. G'night.
3581455 3582568 Oh...
3582640 3584745 Hey, thank you.
3586959 3588552 What did you just say?
3589231 3591336 You know,<br />thanks for lettin' me stay here.
3591407 3595117 It's nice to be out of the impound,<br />and this is... It's great.
3595183 3598598 - Newly refurbished, right?<br />- Yeah.
3599471 3601892 - G'night.<br />- Good night.
3605935 3607364 Hmm.
3622219 3625121 Will you turn<br />that disrespectful junk off?
3625195 3628872 Respect the classics, man.<br />It's Hendrix!
3639436 3640865 Ah!

3657547 3658922 I gotta get outta here!
3659372 3662186 Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?<br />Oh! Oh, my gosh.
3662252 3665383 - Hey, what are you doin'?<br />- Get a good peek, city boy?
3665452 3668801 I just need my<br />daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
3668876 3670915 Wait for him at Flo's.<br />Get outta here.
3670987 3673540 I've been trying<br />to get outta here for three days!
3673611 3676000 Hope you enjoyed the show!
3689036 3690759 Whoa, Doc.
3690827 3694405 Time to clean out the garage, buddy,<br />come on.
3709612 3711368 What?
3712428 3715111 He has a Piston Cup?
3721899 3723590 Oh, my gosh.
3724908 3726850 Three Piston Cups?
3738668 3740577 Sign says stay out.
3741388 3743875 You have three Piston Cups.<br />How could you have...
3743947 3746915 I knew you couldn't drive.<br />I didn't know you couldn't read.
3746988 3749890 - You're the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!
3749963 3752385 Of course. I can't believe<br />I didn't see it before.
3752460 3754118 You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
3754187 3757700 You used to hold the record for most<br />wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.
3757771 3760389 - You gotta show me your tricks. Please.<br />- I tried that.
3760459 3763077 You won three times!<br />Look at those trophies!
3763147 3766443 You look.<br />All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
3771467 3776552 You know, some automotive yoga<br />could really lower your RPM's, man.
3776619 3778342 Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
3778411 3781510 Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!<br />Whoo! That's your color!
3781579 3785157 - Yellow, baby.<br />- Mmm. You smokin' hot!
3785227 3786242 There he is.
3786316 3789185 Oh, my gosh!<br />Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
3792299 3794950 - Doc? Our Doc?<br />- Not Doc Hudson.
3795019 3797507 No, no, no, no, it's true!<br />He's a real racing legend.
3797580 3799751 He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
3799819 3802983 Fabulous? I never seen Doc<br />drive more than 20 miles an hour.
3803051 3805026 I mean, have you ever seen him race?
3805100 3808547 No, but I wish I could have.<br />They say he was amazing!
3808619 3812329 - He won three Piston Cups!<br />- He did what in his cup?
3812395 3814631 I think the heat's<br />startin' to get to the boy!
3814700 3816739 Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.
3816811 3819113 I think he needs<br />a new coat of poly, man.
3819179 3821830 - Are you sick, buddy?<br />- You are lookin' peaked.
3821899 3823590 He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
3825803 3829186 - Hey! What are you doin'?<br />- It's OK. You can trust me, right?
3829260 3831845 I trust you, all right.<br />It's him I'm worried about.
3832748 3834984 Hmm... I trust him.
3835915 3838119 - Come on, let's take a drive.<br />- A drive?
3838187 3839431 Yeah, a drive.
3839499 3842499 Don't you big city racecars<br />ever just take a drive?
3842571 3845157 Ah... No. No, we don't.
3866731 3870408 Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
3875979 3877124 Mm-hm!
3877195 3880512 - And you thought he was gonna run.<br />- Hey, can you believe it, man?
3880588 3882922 He actually thought<br />Doc was a famous racecar!
3883915 3885803 That's so too much!
3887755 3890122 OK, you got me out here.<br />Where are we goin'?
3890188 3892097 I don't know.
3896779 3898688 Whoa! Yes.
3914827 3916388 Oh! Ah-ha-ha!
3916459 3919972 Bleah!
3981292 3983266 Oh!
4002699 4006277 Wow. What is this place?
4006955 4008265 Wheel Well.
4008331 4011462 Used to be the most popular stop<br />on the mother road.
4015915 4017573 This place?
4021035 4023010 Yeah, imagine.
4024619 4027237 Oh, imagine what<br />it must have been like to stay here.
4029483 4030977 You know, I don't get you.
4031051 4034150 How does a Porsche<br />wind up in a place like this?
4034219 4036324 Well, it's really pretty simple.<br />I was...
4036395 4040389 ...an attorney in LA<br />livin' life in the fast lane, and...
4040459 4043875 Oh, you were, were you?<br />Were you rich?
4043948 4047209 - What?<br />- Just... clues to the puzzle.
4047947 4050467 Yeah, OK.<br />Well, that was my life.
4050539 4052230 And you know what?
4052299 4055779 It never felt... happy.
4057355 4060322 Yeah. I mean... really?
4060395 4062053 Yeah. So I left California.
4062123 4065287 Just drove and drove<br />and finally broke down right here.
4065995 4068678 Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
4068747 4071617 Well, they all did. And I never left.
4072843 4074469 Yeah. You know, I understand.
4074539 4077256 You need a little R and R.<br />Recharge the old batteries.
4077323 4080901 But you know, after a while,<br />why didn't you go back?
4081835 4085152 I fell in love.
4085227 4088740 - Oh.<br />- Yep.
4089547 4092230 - Corvette?<br />- No.
4097547 4100198 I fell in love with this.
4111723 4115301 Whoa. Look at that.
4116139 4118376 Look, they're drivin' right by.
4118443 4120548 They don't even know<br />what they're missing!
4121515 4123751 Well,<br />it didn't used to be that way.
4125163 4126439 Oh, yeah?
4126507 4130250 Yeah. Forty years ago,<br />that Interstate down there didn't exist.
4131339 4132288 Really?
4132363 4134949 Yeah. Back then,
4135019 4137768 cars came across the country<br />a whole different way.
4138987 4140264 How do you mean?
4140331 4143593 The road didn't cut through the land<br />like that Interstate.
4143659 4147685 It moved with the land, you know?<br />It rose, it fell, it curved.
4149131 4151041 - Mornin'!<br />- Nice day, huh?
4152875 4155559 Cars didn't drive on it<br />to make great time.
4155627 4158082 They drove on it to have a great time.
4190699 4193001 Well, what happened?
4193067 4196383 The town got bypassed<br />just to save ten minutes of driving.
4279019 4282467 How great would it have been<br />to see this place in its heyday!
4282538 4285222 Oh, I can't tell you how many times<br />I've dreamed of that.
4285291 4288804 But one of these days we'll<br />find a way to get it back on the map.
4288875 4292388 Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.
4292459 4294215 I had a great time.
4294283 4296901 It's kinda nice to slow down<br />every once in a while.
4297515 4299587 You're welcome.
4306667 4307877 Hey, listen, listen!
4307947 4310915 If anybody asks you,<br />we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?
4310986 4312994 Wha... what?
4327691 4329666 Oh, man, the paint's still wet!
4339851 4341639 No, no, no, no!<br />Get out of the store!
4341706 4345154 Hey! Don't eat the radial!<br />Here, take-a the snow tires.
4345227 4347431 - Mater!<br />- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
4347499 4350401 Then where did all these<br />gol-durn tractors come from?
4350635 4352872 - Whoa, boy!<br />- Hey! Hey, guys!
4352939 4354826 There's one goin' this way.
4355754 4357860 I got it.
4361227 4363431 Come here, little tractor,<br />come here.
4363499 4365670 Yeah, that's a good tractor.
4365739 4367048 No, no, no, no, come here.
4367115 4368424 What are you doing?
4368490 4371076 You're not supposed to go<br />wandering off all...
4371370 4373640 ...alone.
4383594 4387653 What are you doin'<br />with those old racin' tires?
4394059 4396262 Come on, Doc, drive.
4470954 4472678 Ah... Yeah.
4472747 4474340 - Wow.<br />- Huh?
4474411 4475938 You're amazing!
4477834 4480006 What are you doin'?
4480075 4481700 Doc, wait!
4485419 4487753 Giddup right in there!<br />Come on, Rusty.
4490539 4493605 Doc, hold it!<br />Seriously, your driving's incredible!
4493675 4496839 - Wonderful. Now, go away.<br />- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
4496907 4498663 - I'm askin' you to leave.<br />- Come on.
4498731 4501600 I'm a racecar,<br />you're a much older racecar,
4501674 4503584 but under the hood<br />you and I are the same.
4503659 4506593 We are not the same!<br />Understand? Now, get out.
4506667 4509482 How could a car like you quit<br />at the top of your game?
4511274 4513641 You think I quit?
4525707 4527332 Right.
4527946 4530467 Your big wreck in '54.
4531178 4533382 They quit on me.
4533450 4536865 When I finally got put together,<br />I went back expecting a big welcome.
4536938 4539720 You know what they said?<br />"You're history. "
4539787 4542721 Moved right on to<br />the next rookie standing in line.
4545451 4547589 There was a lot left in me.
4548299 4551168 I never got a chance to show 'em.
4552619 4556481 I keep that to remind me<br />never to go back.
4557610 4560644 I just never expected that<br />that world would...
4560715 4562820 ...would find me here.
4563882 4566370 - Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.<br />- Oh, yeah?
4566442 4567391 No, I'm not.
4567466 4571143 When is the last time you cared about<br />something except yourself, hot rod?
4571210 4575618 You name me one time<br />and I will take it all back.
4577387 4580256 Uh-huh. I didn't think so.
4580650 4584262 These are good folk around here,<br />who care about one another.
4584875 4587875 I don't want 'em depending<br />on someone they can't count on.
4588426 4590368 Oh, like you?<br />You've been here how long
4590442 4592581 and your friends<br />don't even know who you are?
4593226 4595201 Who's caring about only himself?
4595275 4597958 Just finish that road<br />and get outta here!
4611530 4614116 Will you turn that<br />disrespectful junk off?
4614187 4616521 Respect the classics, man.
4625866 4628550 Ah...
4641898 4643208 He's done.
4643275 4646373 He must've finished it<br />while we was all sleepin'.
4646442 4648581 Good riddance.
4656138 4657513 He's gone?
4657579 4660481 Well, we wouldn't want him<br />to miss that race of his.
4665707 4669863 - Oh, dude, are you crying?<br />- No! I'm happy!
4669930 4672778 I don't have to watch him<br />every second of the day anymore!
4672843 4673988 I'm glad he's gone!
4680330 4682053 What's wrong with Red?
4682122 4685384 Oh, he's just sad<br />'cause you left town
4685450 4688265 and went to your big race to win<br />the Piston Cup
4688330 4691080 that you've always dreamed about<br />your whole life
4691146 4696449 and get that big ol' sponsor and that<br />fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
4700906 4703110 Wait a minute!
4704459 4707175 I knowed you wouldn't leave<br />without saying goodbye.
4707243 4709861 What are you doin' here?<br />You're gonna miss your race.
4709931 4713444 Don't worry. I'll give you<br />a police escort, and we'll make up time.
4713515 4714627 Thank you, Sheriff.
4714698 4716738 But you know I can't go just yet.
4716810 4718239 Well, why not?
4718315 4721032 I'm not sure these tires...
4721099 4723881 ...can get me to California.<br />- Peet stop?
4723946 4727077 Yeah, does anybody know<br />what time Luigi's opens?
4727147 4728427 I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
4728460 4730183 I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
4730378 4732866 <i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>
4732938 4736866 - Would you look at that!<br />- Our first customer in years!
4736938 4740386 I am filled with tears of ecstasy,
4740458 4744168 for this is the most glorious day<br />of my life!
4744235 4748064 All right, Luigi, give me<br />the best set of blackwalls you've got.
4748267 4749444 No! No, no, no.
4749514 4752743 You don't-a know what you want.<br />Luigi know what you want.
4753835 4758025 Blackwall tires.<br />They blend into the pavement.
4758090 4759497 But-a this...
4759786 4761542 Whitewall tires!
4761611 4766564 They say, "Look at me!<br />Here I am! Love me. "
4766634 4768357 All right, you're the expert.
4768426 4771241 Don't forget the spare.
4771306 4774023 <i>- Perfetto. Guido!<br />- Peet stop!</i>
4784938 4787753 What did Luigi tell you, eh?
4787818 4791135 Wow, you were right.<br />Better than a Ferrari, huh?
4791883 4792995 Eh... No.
4796714 4800162 Wow! This organic fuel is great!<br />Why haven't I heard about it before?
4800234 4802143 It's a conspiracy, man!
4802218 4804585 The oil companies got a grip<br />on the government!
4804650 4807749 They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
4807818 4809858 OK, I'll take a case.
4824298 4825705 Ow! Eh!
4834186 4835746 Ah... Yeah.
4836266 4837728 Ka-chow.
4838571 4841418 - Here she comes!<br />- Places, everybody. Hurry!
4841482 4843140 Act natural.
4843211 4844487 <i>- Hi, Sally.<br />- Buon giorno!</i>
4844554 4846310 All right, what's goin' on?
4846378 4848451 Ladies and gentlecars,
4848523 4852297 please welcome<br />the new Lightning McQueen!
4852906 4854816 Pow! What do you think?
4854891 4856996 Radiator Springs<br />looks pretty good on me.
4857067 4858790 I'll say.
4858858 4861924 Ka-chow.
4861994 4864416 You're gonna fit right in<br />in California.
4865258 4868258 My goodness. It looks like<br />you've helped everybody in town.
4868331 4870087 Yeah, everybody except one.
4871274 4876063 - Hey, is it getting dark out?<br />- What? What'd he say?
4876138 4879040 Let me say that again.<br />Is it getting dark out?
4879114 4881219 Now, what was I<br />supposed to do after that?
4904234 4906918 They fixed their neon!
4914026 4918815 - Low and slow?<br />- Oh, yeah, baby!
4922955 4926151 Just like in its heyday, right?
4926218 4929447 It's even better than I pictured it.<br />Thank you.
4955754 4957128 Shall we cruise?
4957194 4959431 Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
4959498 4960905 - No, no, no.<br />- Lizzie!
4960970 4965127 I remember when Stanley<br />first asked me to take a drive with him.
4965195 4967944 Hey, Miss Sally.<br />May I have this cruise?
4968010 4971239 - Of course, Mater.<br />- Uh-uh-uh!
4977450 4981640 ...and again and I said, "No. "<br />He asked me again, and I said, "No. "
4981706 4985863 But, oh, he was a persistent<br />little bugger for a two-cylinder.
4985930 4989192 Finally I said,<br />"All right, one little drive. "
4991274 4994143 Oh!
4998314 5000354 - Hey!<br />- Thanks, Mater.
5000426 5002630 Good evenin', you two.
5005034 5010053 Oh, Stanley,<br />I wish you could see this.
5013994 5017639 - Is that what I think it is?<br />- Oh, I don't know, Flo.
5017706 5023140 I haven't had a chance to find out.<br />But I am going to find out. Hello.
5023210 5025698 Not that. That.
5025770 5025834 Customers?
5025867 5028070 Customers?
5028138 5030691 Customers, everybody!<br />And a lot of 'em!
5030762 5032835 You know what to do.<br />Just like we rehearsed.
5033930 5036418 It's the ghostlight!
5036490 5038977 We have found McQueen.<br />We have found McQueen!
5039818 5041225 McQueen, over here!
5041290 5043940 - Wait, excuse me.<br />- Is it true you've been in rehab?
5044010 5046050 - Did you have a nervous breakdown?<br />- What?
5046122 5048740 - McQueen's wearing whitewalls!<br />- Your tires balding?
5048810 5049759 Stickers!
5049834 5051906 - Was McQueen your prisoner?<br />- Shoot, no!
5051978 5054345 We're best buds!<br />I ain't braggin' or nothin',
5054410 5057476 but I was in charge of huntin' him down<br />if he tried to escape.
5057546 5059073 Sally! Sally!
5059146 5061121 Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
5061195 5062853 - Stickers?<br />- Sally!

5079435 5081223 Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

5266794 5269477 I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
5326602 5329799 Hello, race fans. Welcome<br />to what has become, quite simply,
5329866 5332070 the biggest event<br />in the history of racing.
5332138 5334276 A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
5334345 5336712 There's a crowd<br />of nearly 200,000 cars
5336778 5339233 here at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway.
5339306 5343462 Tickets to this race are hotter than a<br />black leather seat on a hot summer day!
5343530 5345985 The King, Chick Hicks<br />and Lightning McQueen
5346058 5349255 in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,<br />tiebreaker race.
5349322 5352420 I got a lotta miles on me,<br />but let me tell you somethin'.
5352490 5356319 I never thought I'd see anything<br />like this. This is exciting!
5356394 5358630 In fact, the country<br />has almost shut down
5358697 5362626 to watch what many experts<br />are calling "the race of the century. "
5362698 5365218 Hey, King!<br />Good luck in your last race.
5365290 5369218 - You've sure been an inspiration to me.<br />- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
5369290 5372257 - Hey, be careful out there, OK?<br />- Yeah, man.
5372330 5373279 He's hot!
5373353 5375906 Wanna know the forecast?<br />I'll give you the forecast.
5375977 5378945 A 100 percent chance of thunder!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5379018 5381439 Say it with me!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5381514 5384329 Hey, you! No admittance<br />without a garage pass.
5384394 5387045 Oh, it's OK.<br />Lightning McQueen knows me!
5387114 5390114 Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day<br />for a race, isn't it?
5390186 5394942 - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.<br />- And good morning to you, Fred.
5395018 5398760 Mario Andretti knows my name!<br />You gotta let me in now!
5398826 5400036 Sorry, pal.
5400106 5404197 OK, here we go.<br />Focus. Speed.
5404937 5407621 I am speed.
5409290 5410435 Victory.
5410506 5412546 One winner, two losers.
5414570 5419873 Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
5424841 5426368 Lightnin'! You ready?
5426442 5429028 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
5441834 5444551 Mack, thanks for being<br />my pit crew today.
5444618 5447106 Don't worry about it, kid.<br />It's the least I could do.
5447177 5449479 After all, "Gas Can"<br />is my middle name.
5449545 5451814 - It is?<br />- Ah... Not really.
5468393 5469735 Uh-oh
5480169 5483017 Nelson! Zoom in.<br />Ready, 16? Take 16.
5483178 5485317 And there he is,<br />Lightning McQueen!
5485386 5488385 Missing all week, and then he turns up<br />in the middle of nowhere!
5488457 5490759 In a little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
5490825 5493760 Wearin' whitewall tires,<br />of all things.
5494858 5497858 - Oh!<br />- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5499113 5501350 Hey, where you been?<br />I've been kinda lonely.
5501418 5504200 Nobody to hang out with.<br />I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
5504265 5507135 And the twins. Of course.<br />The ones that used to be your fans,
5507210 5510243 but now they're my fans.<br />Listen to what the twins think...
5516810 5518784 Agh! Shoot!
5518858 5521858 Boogity, boogity, boogity,<br />boys! Let's go racin'!
5527882 5529376 Come on, you can do it!
5529450 5531392 Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
5532554 5535620 Fifty laps down, and The King<br />is still holding a slim lead.
5535689 5538788 McQueen's got a run on him!<br />He's lookin' to the inside!
5540874 5542946 Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
5543017 5545319 Chick's not<br />making it easy on him today.
5545386 5547044 He lost momentum,
5547113 5549317 and now he's gonna have to<br />chase him back down!
5558346 5560320 McQueen spins out in the infield!
5564137 5566625 Just me<br />and the old man, fellas.
5566698 5570080 McQueen just doesn't have it today.
5571209 5575104 - Hey, kid, are you all right?<br />- I don't know, Mack.
5575178 5576552 I don't think I...
5576617 5579235 I didn't come all this way<br />to see you quit.
5579466 5580927 Doc?
5583497 5586018 Guys, you're here!<br />I can't believe this!
5586090 5589701 I knew you needed a crew chief,<br />but I didn't know it was this bad.
5589769 5591592 You said you'd never come back.
5591658 5595106 Well, I really didn't have a choice.<br />Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
5595177 5597960 Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
5601770 5605119 All right, if you can drive as good<br />as you can fix a road
5605194 5608325 then you can win this race<br />with your eyes shut.
5608394 5610303 Now, get back out there!
5612457 5615305 Hot snot, we are back in business!<br />Guido! Luigi!
5615369 5617573 You're goin' up<br />against professional pit crews.
5617641 5620674 - You're gonna have to be fast.<br />- They will not know what bit them!
5620745 5622371 Kid, you can beat these guys.
5622441 5625703 Find a groove that works for you<br />and get that lap back.
5636938 5638760 - Is it?<br />- Oh, wow. That's him!
5638825 5642437 Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!<br />The Hudson Hornet's back!
5642505 5645025 It appears McQueen<br />has got himself a pit crew.
5645097 5647399 And look who he has for a crew chief!
5647465 5650051 - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Whoa!
5650122 5653318 Well, dip me in axle grease<br />and call me Slick! It surely is.
5657769 5659711 <i>Wow, this is history<br />in the making.</i>
5659785 5662567 <i>Nobody has seen the racing legend<br />in over 50 years!</i>
5662633 5663975 Hey, Doc!
5664041 5668035 Come look at this fellow on the radio.<br />He looks just like you.
5672746 5676390 - McQueen passes on the inside!<br />- He's nearly a lap down.
5676457 5679239 Can he catch up to them<br />with only 60 laps to go?
5679305 5682088 You're goin' great, kid.<br />Just keep your head on.
5682154 5683681 <i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>
5683753 5686536 Hey, shrimpie,<br />where did McQueen find you, huh?
5686602 5689897 Those round things are called tires,<br />and they go under the car!
5691017 5693505 <i>Con chi credi di parlare?<br />Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>
5693578 5696611 No! No, no! You'll have your chance.<br />You will have your chance.
5710473 5713157 Oh, kid's just tryin'<br />to be a hero, huh?
5714665 5715876 What do you think of this?
5715946 5718018 Yeah, that's it, kid.
5721193 5722437 What?
5722505 5724229 Whoa! Git-R-done!
5725929 5730020 - I taught him that. Ka-chow!<br />- Ah!
5730089 5732937 What a move by McQueen!<br />He's caught up to the leaders.
5733001 5734757 Yeah. This is what it's all about.
5734825 5737859 A three-way battle for the lead,<br />with ten to go!
5741353 5744419 Look at that boy go out there!
5749897 5752101 Oh!
5753001 5754495 No, you don't.
5757449 5759358 Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
5759433 5762728 - Can you get back to the pits?<br />- Yeah, yeah. I think so.
5762794 5765958 Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.<br />Don't tear yourself up, kid.
5767817 5769857 We gotta get him<br />back out there fast
5769929 5772744 or we're gonna be a lap down,<br />and we'll never win this race!
5772809 5774881 Guido! It's time.
5778985 5781952 Hey, tiny,<br />you gonna clean his windshield?
5790697 5792071 I don't believe it!
5792137 5793763 That was<br />the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
5793833 5796288 It was a great stop,<br />but he's still gotta beat that pace car!
5796361 5797987 It's gonna be close.
5799593 5801960 Yeah, baby!
5802025 5803334 <i>He's back in!</i>
5804617 5805566 Peet stop.
5806954 5808808 - Guido, you did it!<br />- Way to go, Guido!
5823465 5826400 This is it. We're heading into<br />the final lap and McQueen
5826473 5828742 is right behind the leaders.<br />What a comeback!
5828809 5832192 A hundred and ninety-nine<br />laps! It all comes down to this!
5832266 5833476 This is it, kiddo.
5833545 5835934 You've got four turns left.<br />One at a time.
5836010 5838344 Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.
5838409 5839751 Go!
5842345 5843425 We'll see about that!
5844873 5846367 McQueen's going inside!
5849225 5852127 - Chick and King are loose!<br />- I think McQueen's out!
5862378 5864744 - McQueen saved it!<br />- He's back on the track!
5865129 5867682 - Float like a Cadillac...<br />- Sting like a Beemer!
5868713 5872193 Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
5873706 5876575 Lightning McQueen<br />is gonna win the Piston Cup!
5876649 5878656 Come on! You got it!<br />You got it, Stickers!
5880105 5883750 I am not comin' in<br />behind you again, old man.
5893673 5895495 Oh, no!
5913257 5915363 Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
5915434 5919012 I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
5920265 5922305 What's he up to, Doc?
5932266 5933575 What are you doin', kid?
5933641 5936740 I think The King<br />should finish his last race.
5939785 5942655 You just gave up the Piston Cup,<br />you know that?
5942729 5946177 This grumpy old racecar I know<br />once told me somethin'.
5946249 5948224 It's just an empty cup.
5950250 5952705 Darrell, is pushing<br />on the last lap legal?
5952778 5956291 He's not really pushin' him. He's<br />just givin' him a little bump draft.
5956362 5958565 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
5958633 5961219 Hey. What? What's goin' on?
5961289 5963460 That's what I call racin'.
5978761 5981696 <i>- Bravo il mio amico!<br />- Way to go, buddy!</i>
5981769 5984257 There's a lotta love out there,<br />you know, man?
5984329 5988672 - Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.<br />- That's my hot rod.
5990633 5993928 Come on, baby, bring it out!<br />Bring out the Piston Cup!
5993993 5995335 Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5995401 5998249 Yeah!<br />Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
5998313 6001313 Hey, how come the only one celebrating<br />is me, huh?
6001386 6003524 Where are the girls?<br />Bring on the confetti!
6003593 6007041 Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.<br />What's goin' on?
6007113 6010277 Come on, snap some pictures.<br />I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!
6010345 6011752 Say it with me. Ka-chicka!
6011913 6013375 - Boo!<br />- Boo!
6013449 6016417 What's wrong with everybody?<br />Where's the happiness?
6016489 6018497 Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!
6024169 6026558 - Thanks, Lightnin'.<br />- You're welcome.
6028874 6031208 - Way to go, King!<br />- You're still the car!
6031273 6033183 You're The King! Yeah!
6043177 6046493 - You made us proud, kid!<br />- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
6049577 6052098 You got a lotta stuff, kid.
6052297 6053890 Thanks, Doc.
6054985 6056262 Hey, Lightnin'.
6056329 6058882 How 'bout comin' over here<br />and talk to me a minute?
6059753 6062655 Son, that was some<br />real racin' out there.
6062729 6065379 How'd you like to become<br />the new face of Dinoco?
6069897 6071304 But I didn't win.
6071369 6074882 Lightnin', there's a whole lot<br />more to racin' than just winnin'.
6074954 6077539 He was so rusty,<br />when he drove down the street
6077609 6081603 buzzards used to circle the car!
6081674 6083332 Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...
6083401 6086979 ...but these Rust-eze guys over there<br />gave me my big break.
6088457 6090115 I'm gonna stick with them.
6090185 6093120 Well, I sure can respect that.
6093194 6094306 Still, you know,
6094377 6098087 if there's ever anything<br />I can do for you, just let me know.
6098153 6100574 I sure appreciate that.<br />Thank you.
6101993 6104862 Actually, there is one thing.
6105545 6107683 Whoo-hoo!
6107753 6111462 Hey, look at me!<br />I'm flyin', by golly!
6115785 6118654 I'm happier than a tornado<br />in a trailer park!
6122153 6124357 I think it's about-a time<br />we redecorate.
6127369 6130664 Hi. Lightning McQueen told me<br />this was the best place in the world
6130729 6131678 to get tires.
6131753 6135779 How 'bout setting me and my friends up<br />with three or four sets each?
6135849 6140835 Guido! There is a real<br />Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.
6140905 6143109 A real Ferrari!
6143177 6145217 Punch me, Guido.<br />Punch me in the face.
6145289 6148605 This is the most glorious day<br />of my life.
6149865 6153280 <i>Wow.<br />Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>
6153353 6155590 <i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>
6171209 6172670 Just passin' through?
6172745 6174949 Actually, I thought I'd stop<br />and stay awhile.
6175017 6178148 - I hear this place is back on the map.<br />- It is?
6178217 6181829 There's some rumor floating around<br />that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar
6181897 6184264 is setting up his big<br />racing headquarters here.
6184329 6187046 Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
6187113 6189502 You know, I really missed you, Sally.
6189577 6193538 Well, I create feelings in others<br />they themselves don't understand and,
6193609 6195681 blah, blah, blah.
6196073 6198942 <i>McQueen and Sally<br />parked beneath the tree,</i>
6199017 6203457 <i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>
6203817 6205704 Great timing, Mater!
6205768 6209598 Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!
6209673 6212007 He's my best friend.<br />What're you gonna do?
6212073 6214888 So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?
6214953 6217539 I don't know.<br />Why don't we just take a drive?
6217609 6220097 Hmm... Nah.
6221769 6223913 Yeah! Ka-chow!
6286313 6290142 Ah-choo!

6295784 6300356 We is now entering the Doc Hudson<br />wing of the museum.
6300424 6303271 Wow. Unbelievable.<br />That many wins in a single season.
6303336 6307231 He's the real deal, Junior.<br />The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.
6307304 6310620 Excuse me, son.<br />Is Doc Hudson here today?
6310696 6314340 Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc<br />went out for a drive or somethin'.
6317544 6320577 - Whoo! Whoo!<br />- Yeah!
6320648 6323070 Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.
6323144 6326079 Not today, old man.<br />I know all your tricks.

6334184 6336289 Not all my tricks, rookie!
6352232 6355581 Attention!<br />Kiss the pavement goodbye.
6355656 6358951 When I'm finished, you'll have mud<br />in places you didn't know you had!
6359016 6362693 - Yo, I've never been off-road!<br />- Well, that's gonna change right now!

6380712 6384509 Well, it fits perfectly.<br />How do I look? Ah-choo!
6389960 6391170 Oh, dang.

6399592 6404164 <i>You are a sad, strange little wagon<br />and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>
6404552 6407170 <i>Oh, yeah?<br />Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

6445032 6447453 <i>These are the lousiest<br />circus cars in the world,</i>
6447528 6449438 <i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>
6449512 6450592 Wait a minute here.
6450664 6453031 They're just usin' the same actor<br />over and over.
6453096 6455551 What kind of a cut-rate production<br />is this?
6652968 6657441 Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we<br />please ask someone for directions?
6657512 6661570 No! There's an on-ramp close!<br />I know it! I can feel it!
