2051150 2053812 You start there where the road begins.
2054187 2057179 You finish down there<br />where the road ends.
2059158 2061422 [Mater] Holy shoot!
2061961 2064361 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />How long is this gonna take?
2064430 2067991 Well, fella does it right,<br />should take him about five days.
2068067 2069227 Five days?
2069302 2072237 But I should be in California<br />schmoozing Dinoco right now!
2072305 2075274 Then if I were you,<br />I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!
2075341 2077832 - Hook him up, Mater.<br />- Okay-dokey.
2079479 2082039 [grunting]
2082114 2085550 [tires squealing, engine revving]
2085918 2088148 [Lightning] Freedom!
2093459 2096986 Maybe I should've<br />hooked him up to Bessie...
2097763 2101062 ...and then...<br />then took the boot off.
2102535 2104935 Whoo-hoo!
2105671 2109664 Goodbye, Radiator Springs,<br />and goodbye, Bessie!
2109742 2113610 California, here I come! Yeah!
2115982 2117973 Oh, feel that wind.
2118417 2120009 Yes!
2120086 2121110 [sputtering]
2121187 2123212 No. No, no, no.
2123523 2125821 No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?
2125892 2127883 How can I be outta gas?
2127960 2131919 [chuckling] Boy, we ain't<br />as dumb as you think we are.
2131998 2134330 [stuttering] But how did,<br />how did... you...?
2134400 2136732 We siphoned your gas<br />while you were passed out.
2136802 2139703 - Ka-chow.<br />- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
2148114 2150514 - Gentlemen.<br />- Sheriff.
2150583 2151675 Hey, Sheriff.
2151751 2154015 - Why here?<br />- <i>[Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.</i>
2154086 2156577 - They were better before.<br />- <i>Stai sempre a parlare.</i>
2156656 2158521 - Guido!<br />- Red, can you move over?
2158591 2161424 I want to get a look<br />at that sexy hot rod.
2161494 2164327 You know, I used to be<br />a purty good whistler.
2164397 2167127 I can't do it now, of course,<br />on account of sometimes
2167199 2170100 I get fluid built up<br />in my engine block,
2170169 2173536 but Doc said he's gonna fix it.<br />He can fix about anything.
2173606 2175836 That's why we made him the judge.
2176008 2180172 Boy, you shoulda heard me on<br /><i>Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>
2180246 2181611 Now, I'm not one to brag
2181681 2184980 but people come purty far<br />to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
2185451 2186475 Oh!
2186552 2189385 - Aw, man, that's just great!<br />- Hey, what's wrong?
2189455 2191252 My lucky sticker's all dirty.
2191324 2193588 Ah, that ain't nothin'.<br />I'll clean it for ya.
2193659 2198358 - [snorting, hacking]<br />- No, no, no!
2198431 2200763 That won't be necessary.
2201834 2205133 Hey! Hey, big fella!<br />Yeah, you in the red!
2205204 2207832 I could use a little hose down.<br />Help me wash this off.
2210276 2211265 Where's he goin'?
2211344 2214780 Oh, he's a little bit shy, and<br />he hates you for killin' his flowers.
2214847 2216371 I shouldn't put up with this.
2216449 2219316 I'm a precision instrument<br />of speed and aerodynamics.
2219385 2222411 - You hurt your what?<br />- I'm a very famous racecar!
2222688 2225885 You are a famous racecar?<br />A real racecar?
2225958 2228586 Yes, I'm a real racecar.<br />What do you think? Look at me.
2228661 2232654 I have followed racing my entire life.<br />My whole life!
2232732 2235030 Then you know who I am.<br />I'm Lightning McQueen.
2235101 2237194 - Lightning McQueen?<br />- Yes! Yes!
2237269 2239260 I must scream it to the world!
2239338 2243570 My excitement from the top<br />of someplace very high!
2243643 2246134 - Do you know many Ferraris?<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2246212 2249181 They race on the European circuit.<br />I'm in the Piston Cup!
2249949 2252884 - [Lightning] What?<br />- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
2257757 2260317 Is that what I think it is?
2261894 2263156 [Sally] Customers.
2263229 2266687 Customers!<br />Customers, everyone! Customers!
2266766 2268131 - [Sally] OK!<br />- Customers?
2268200 2271033 [Sally] Been a long time.<br />Remember what we rehearsed.
2271103 2273663 Make sure your<br />"Open, please come in" signs are out.
2273739 2277266 You all know what to do.<br />All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
2277343 2280005 Van, I just don't see<br />any on-ramp anywhere.
2280079 2284482 - Minny, I know exactly where we are.<br />- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
2284550 2287212 - Honey, please.<br />- [Sally] Hello.
2287286 2290255 Welcome to Radiator Springs,<br />gateway to Ornament Valley.
2290322 2292586 Legendary for<br />its service and hospitality.
2292658 2293682 How can we help you?
2293759 2297820 - We don't need anything, thank you.<br />- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
2297897 2301128 There's no need to ask for directions.<br />I know where we're going.
2301200 2303634 He did the same thing<br />on our trip to Shakopee.
2303703 2306536 We were headed over there<br />for the Crazy Days, and we...
2306605 2309665 - OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?<br />- What you really need
2309742 2313803 is the sweet taste<br />of my homemade, organic fuel.
2313879 2315574 No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
2315648 2318845 - Just trying to find the Interstate.<br />- Good to see you, soldier!
2318918 2322251 Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut<br />for your government surplus needs.
2322321 2324653 - Honey, surplus!<br />- We have too much surplus.
2324724 2327056 I do have a map<br />over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
2327126 2330289 And if you stay, we offer a free<br />Lincoln Continental breakfast.
2330362 2334093 - Honey, she's got a map.<br />- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.
2334166 2337624 - Never need a map again, thank you.<br />- How 'bout somethin' to drink?
2337703 2341639 Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.<br />Finest fuel on Route 66.
2341707 2342867 No we just topped off.
2342942 2346810 And if you need tires,<br />stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,
2346879 2349347 home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
2349415 2352748 - We're trying to find the Interstate.<br />- But you do need a paint job.
2352818 2355981 Ramone will paint you up right.<br />Hey, anything you want!
2356055 2358353 - You know, like a flame job.<br />- No thanks...
2358424 2359755 Maybe ghost flames!
2359825 2362385 You like old school pinstripin'?<br />Von Dutch style?
2362461 2366363 - [both gasp]<br />- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
2366432 2369458 [chuckling] OK, no.<br />We're gonna be going now, OK?
2369535 2371025 Ow!

2374540 2376633 - OK!<br />- Come back soon, OK?
2376709 2380201 I mean, you know where we are!<br />Tell your friends!
2381814 2383873 [Van] OK! Yes. You bet.
2383949 2386213 Thanks again, folks.<br />Bye-bye now.
2386285 2389379 Psst! Psst!<br />Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
2389455 2391616 - I know how to get to the Interstate!<br />- Do ya?
2391690 2394352 - Minny, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2394426 2395893 No, not really. But listen.
2395961 2399590 I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.<br />I'm being held against my will.
2399665 2402190 I need you to call my team,<br />so they can come rescue me
2402268 2406102 and get me to California in time for me<br />to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
2407072 2409336 - <i>[locks beeping]</i><br />- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2409408 2413276 No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!<br />You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
2413345 2416508 I'm in hillbilly hell!<br />My IQ's dropping by the second!
2416582 2418675 I'm becoming one of them!
2418751 2420480 - [Lightning echoes]<br />- [sighing]
2420553 2422680 OK, don't worry.<br />They know where we are now.
2422755 2424518 They'll tell friends. You'll see.
2424590 2427457 <i>[Male DJ] We'll be back</i><br /><i>for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>
2427526 2430256 - That's good.<br />- <i>...after a Piston Cup update.</i>
2430329 2434231 <i>[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning</i><br /><i>McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

2448280 2450077 Hoo-hoo-hoo!
2455154 2456143 Ha-ha!
2459992 2460981 Yeah!
2462261 2464354 [crowd shouting and cheering]
2469268 2472533 [girls chattering and giggling]
2472605 2474937 Hey, McQueen...<br />Eat your heart out.
2475407 2477238 [gasping] Oh!
2477309 2478674 Let me get this straight.
2478744 2481679 I can go when this road is done.<br />That's the deal, right?
2481747 2485478 - That's what they done did said.<br />- OK. Outta my way.
2485551 2486643 I got a road to finish.
2487953 2490353 [grunting and revving]
2498497 2500897 - He's done!<br />- Done?
2500966 2503332 - Uh-huh.<br />- It's only been an hour.
2505271 2508604 - [Bessie groans]<br />- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
2508674 2511541 Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.<br />That's all you gotta say.
2512144 2515807 [Mater] Whee-hoo!<br />I'm the first one on the new road!
2516382 2517974 Oh!
2519318 2522014 [vibrating] It rides purty smooth.
2522254 2525712 - It looks awful!<br />- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
2525824 2529316 - Oh!<br />- [blubbering]
2529695 2531686 Red.
2534300 2535631 Who do you think you are?
2535701 2539000 Look, Doc said when I finish,<br />I could go. That was the deal.
2539071 2542507 The deal was you fix the road,<br />not make it worse.
2542574 2545042 Now, scrape it off!<br />Start over again.
2545110 2548739 Hey, look, grandpa,<br />I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
2548814 2550304 Oh-ho-ho-ho!
2550382 2554614 Is that right? Then why don't we<br />just have a little race? Me and you.
2554687 2558487 - What?<br />- [chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?
2558557 2560923 If you win, you go and I fix the road.
2560993 2563689 If I win, you do the road my way.
2563762 2565286 Doc, what're you doin'?
2565664 2567495 I don't mean to be rude here,
2567566 2571297 but you probably go zero to sixty in,<br />like, what? Three-point-five years?
2571370 2573895 Then I reckon<br />you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
2573973 2578637 You know what, old-timer?<br />That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
2580379 2582904 [Sheriff] Gentlemen,<br />this will be a one-lap race.
2582982 2587476 You will drive to Willy's Butte,<br />go around Willy's Butte and come back.
2587553 2590488 There will be no bumpin',<br />no cheatin', no spittin',
2590556 2593081 no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
2593158 2598289 no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',<br />no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
2598364 2600127 and no lollygaggin'.
2600199 2601757 Speed. I'm speed.
2601834 2604394 Float like a Cadillac,<br />sting like a Beemer.
2604470 2605494 [Luigi laughs]
2605637 2610438 My friend Guido, he dream to give<br />a real racecar a pit stop.
2610509 2613034 - Peet stop!<br />- Uh... [chuckles]
2613112 2615979 The race is only one lap, guys.
2616048 2618539 <i>Uno</i> lappo! Don't need any help.
2618617 2622451 - I work <i>solo mio.</i><br />- Fine. Race your way.
2623756 2627624 - No pit stoppo. Comprendo?<br />- OK.
2627726 2629717 Gentlemen...
2630362 2633195 ...start your engines!
2635334 2636995 [engine sputters]
2637436 2639904 [revving furiously]
2639972 2642338 - <i>¡Hijole!</i> Check that out!<br />- Whoa.
2642408 2645502 Great idea, Doc.<br />Now the road will never get done.
2645878 2647175 Luigi?
2647246 2650443 [chuckling] On your mark, get set...
2650516 2652746 <i>Uno</i> for the money,<br /><i>due</i> for the show,
2652818 2658518 <i>tre</i> to get ready, and <i>quattro</i><br />to... I can't believe it. Go!
2659858 2660950 [giggling]
2662561 2664461 [cheering]
2666999 2668330 Huh?
2668967 2671492 Doc... the flag means go.
2671570 2674903 Remember the fl...<br />Here we go. Go.
2674973 2677703 Doc, what are you doing, man?
2677776 2681337 Oh, dear. It would seem<br />I'm off to a poor start.
2681413 2684541 Well, better late than never.<br />Come on, Mater.
2684616 2687380 - Might need a little help.<br />- Uh... OK.
2689088 2690521 You got your tow cable?
2690589 2692784 Well, yeah,<br />I always got my tow cable. Why?
2692858 2695156 [Doc] Oh, just in case.
2703702 2705897 [yelling] Ow! Ow!<br />Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
2705971 2707700 No, no, no, no, no!
2707840 2710240 - Oh, man!<br />- Whoa.
2710976 2713274 - Ow!<br />- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.
2713345 2714778 [revving]
2716448 2722444 Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac<br />or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
2722521 2724887 - I'm confused.<br />- [chuckling]
2724957 2727050 [Doc] You drive like you fix roads.
2727126 2730323 Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
2734133 2735964 [gasps] Ah!
2736702 2739671 I'm startin' to think he knowed<br />you was gonna crash!
2739738 2742866 Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
2745978 2747912 I can make a little turn on dirt.
2747980 2749413 You think?
2749481 2753941 No. And now I'm a day behind.<br />I'm never gonna get outta here!
2754019 2756487 Hey, <i>ése!</i><br />You need a new paint job, man!
2756555 2759524 - [Lightning] No, thank you.<br />- How 'bout some organic fuel?
2759591 2761957 - That freak juice?<br />- [Lightning] Pass.
2762027 2766487 Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.<br />Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
2766565 2768157 Nah, not me, Flo.
2768233 2770701 I'm on one of them there special diets.
2770769 2775365 I'm a precisional instrument<br />of speed and aero-matics.
2775941 2778205 "You race like you fix roads."
2778277 2783044 [grunting] I'll show him.<br />[grunting] I will show him!
2791390 2795724 - [tar splattering]<br />- Oh, great! I hate it!
2795794 2799423 - Hate, hate, hate, hate it!<br />- [chuckles] Music. Sweet music.
2800632 2803192 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
2803268 2805998 [Lightning]<br />Radiator Springs, a happy place!
2806071 2809097 OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?
2811643 2815443 Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!<br />I'm talking to Bessie!
2828493 2829551 Wow.

2836935 2838960 Yes! Uh, amazing!
2839438 2843067 Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]
2843141 2847339 Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't<br />seen you that low in years.
2847412 2849972 I haven't seen a road like this<br />in years.
2850048 2854178 - Well, then let's cruise, baby.<br />- Low and slow.
2854253 2856448 <i>[Italian] È bellissima!</i> It's beautiful!
2856521 2860252 Guido, look, it's-a like<br />it was paved by angels.
2861193 2862490 Boy, I tell you what.
2862561 2865394 I bet even the roads on the moon<br />ain't this smooth.
2865464 2867125 Doc, look at this!
2867266 2870133 Shoulda tossed him into<br />the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
2870202 2873694 Well, he ain't finished yet.<br />Still got a long way to go.
2873772 2876741 Guido, look at Luigi!
2877342 2879071 This is <i>fantastico!</i>
2879144 2882602 That looks like fun!<br />Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
2882681 2886981 Hey, Luigi, this new road<br />makes your place look like a dump.
2887653 2890349 That crazy old devil woman.
2890822 2894223 [sighs] Oh!
2894293 2896124 She's right!

2897829 2901595 Huh. That punk actually did a good job.
2902868 2906668 Well, now... where the heck is he?
2913011 2915741 Sheriff!<br />Is he makin' another run for it?
2915814 2919181 No, no. He ran outta asphalt<br />in the middle of the night,
2919251 2921617 and asked me if he could<br />come down here.
2921687 2924087 All he's tryin' to do<br />is make that there turn.
2924156 2926989 [Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
2927459 2929984 Perfect turns on every track<br />I've ever raced on.
2932197 2936156 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself<br />a quart of oil at Flo's.
2936234 2937633 I'll keep an eye on him.
2937703 2941605 Well, thanks, Doc.<br />I've been feelin' a quart low.
2943275 2946073 [engine revving]
2949448 2951439 [screaming]
2953051 2955246 [spitting]
2955987 2958455 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
2958523 2961253 Oh, great. What do you want?<br />You here to gloat?
2961326 2964659 You don't have three-wheel brakes,<br />so you got to pitch it hard,
2964730 2968222 break it loose and then<br />just drive it with the throttle.
2968300 2971360 Give it too much, you'll be<br />outta the dirt and into the tulips.
2971436 2974530 So you're a judge,<br />a doctor and a racing expert.
2974606 2976267 I'll put it simple.
2976341 2980505 If you're goin' hard enough left,<br />you'll find yourself turnin' right.
2981580 2986984 Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.<br />Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
2987052 2988849 Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
2988920 2992515 Because in Opposite World,<br />maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
2995327 2998728 Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
2999965 3001796 [groans]
3006371 3008305 [Lightning] Turn right to go left.
3009574 3011565 Hmm...
3011643 3012701 Whoa!
3014079 3016513 - Oh!<br />- [car crashing]
3016982 3020941 - Ow! Oh, that...<br />- [cactus crashing]
3022521 3025888 [screaming] Ow!
3027325 3030590 Turn right to go left.<br />Guess what. I tried it.
3030662 3033756 You know what? This crazy thing<br />happened... I went right!
3033832 3037233 You keep talkin' to yourself,<br />people'll think you're crazy.
3037302 3041238 - Thanks for the tip.<br />- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
3048113 3051674 - Oh, Guido, <i>è bellissimo!</i><br />- <i>Che cosa?</i>
3051750 3056119 - It looks great! This is great!<br />- <i>Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>
3057122 3058646 [grunts, passes gas]
3058723 3060714 Oh, Lord.
3060792 3062419 - [chuckles]<br />- [Sheriff] Mater!
3062494 3064655 I need you<br />to watch the prisoner tonight.
3064729 3068028 Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.<br />What if he tries to run again?
3068099 3070932 Just let him run outta gas<br />and tow him on back.
3071002 3073470 - But keep an eye on him.<br />- Yes, sir!
3074573 3076234 [groaning] Oh...
3076308 3078970 While I'm stuck here<br />paving this stinkin' road,
3079044 3081604 Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
3081680 3084945 My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />Who's touching me?
3085016 3087314 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
3087385 3089410 You make-a such a nice new road.
3089488 3092150 You come to my shop.<br />Luigi take-a good care of you.
3092224 3093816 Even though you not a Ferrari.
3093892 3097988 You buy four tires,<br />I give you a full-a size spare
3098063 3101931 - absolutely free!<br />- Look, I get all my tires for free.
3102000 3105527 [chuckling] I like your style, eh?
3105604 3109165 You drive the hard bargain.<br />OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
3109241 3112699 You buy one tire,<br />I give you three for free!
3112777 3114438 [Flo] Oh, would you look at that?
3114513 3116640 Ramone, Ramone!
3116715 3118808 [Luigi] Then Luigi make you<br />a new new deal.
3118884 3121876 [Lightning] No, no, no, no.<br />Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
3121953 3125582 - No, no, no, no. No.<br />- This is it. My last offer.
3125657 3130356 You buy one tire, I give you<br />seven-a snow tires for free!
3130428 3133295 Done. You interested, you call me.<br />You know where I am.
3133365 3134627 [exhales deeply]
3134699 3135859 Ah!
3135934 3138061 Stop! Let me...
3139471 3142304 Oh, Red, you missed a spot.<br />See it right there?
3142374 3144399 - No! No!<br />- On the hood right there.
3144476 3147809 Stop, stop! That's cold!
3147879 3150370 Help! Please! Stop!
3150448 3153815 - [coughing, sputtering]<br />- Thanks, Red.
3155053 3156315 What was that for?
3156388 3158515 - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?<br />- Huh?
3158590 3160080 If you do, you gotta be clean.
3160158 3162683 'Cause even in hillbilly hell<br />we have standards.
3162761 3164490 What, I...? I don't get it.
3164563 3167157 I thought I'd say thank you<br />for doin' a great job.
3167232 3170463 So I thought I'd let you stay with me.<br />I mean, not with me!
3170535 3175165 But there. Not with me there,<br />but there in your own cozy cone.
3175240 3179108 - And I'd be in my cone, and it's...<br />- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
3179177 3181577 If you want to stay<br />at the dirty impound, fine.
3181646 3184911 - I understand you criminal types.<br />- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
3184983 3188180 - Yeah, the Cozy Cone.<br />- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.
3188253 3191711 [Lightning chuckles] Yeah,<br />it's like a clever little twist.
3191790 3195920 The motel's made out of caution cones,<br />which, of course, cars try to avoid.
3195994 3199361 But now we're gonna stay in them.<br />That's funny.
3200865 3203095 Figure that all out on your own,<br />did you?
3204069 3206537 Cone number one, if you want.
3207639 3210005 Oh...
3211142 3214873 Hey, do I spy a little<br />pinstriping tattoo back there?
3214946 3218040 Oh... [chuckles]<br />That's just a... Oh!
3218116 3220277 [both chuckle]
3220619 3223952 Oh, you saw that? Yeah.<br />Just gonna be going.
3224022 3226650 Gonna... Yeah.
3231396 3233990 - You know, I knew this girl Doreen.<br />- [gasps]
3234065 3235555 Good-lookin' girl.
3235634 3238933 Looked just like a Jaguar,<br />only she was a truck!
3239004 3242496 You know, I used to crash into her,<br />just so I could spoke to her.
3243608 3246076 - What are you talking about?<br />- I don't know.
3246144 3250274 Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,<br />'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
3250348 3254512 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,<br />and I have to get out of here.
3254586 3258147 Well, that's all right,<br />Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
3258223 3260521 You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
3260592 3262355 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
3262427 3265419 You know who you're talkin' to?<br />This is Lightning McQueen.
3265497 3267829 I can handle anything.
3267899 3272734 - [whispering] I'm not doin' this.<br />- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]
3273004 3276531 - [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.<br />- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.
3276608 3279042 - [tractors snore]<br />- [Mater] All right, listen.
3279110 3283103 When I say go, we go.<br />But don't let Frank catch you. Go!
3283181 3285012 Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?
3286017 3287985 [Lightning whispering] Mater!
3288053 3289486 Wait, Mater!
3291256 3292621 OK, here's what you do.
3292691 3296092 You just sneak up in front of 'em,<br />and then honk.
3296161 3298652 And they do the rest. Watch this.
3305704 3307535 - [honking loudly]<br />- Oh!
3307605 3312804 Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

3326791 3329385 Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.
3332363 3334957 - [honking]<br />- Oh!
3335033 3338628 Oh! Oh... [mooing]
3338703 3341604 [gas sloshing, backfiring]
3341673 3345666 [laughing] I don't care who you are,<br />that's funny right there.
3345744 3347507 Oh, your turn, bud.
3347579 3349979 Mater, I can't.<br />I don't even have a horn.
3350048 3352278 - Baby.<br />- I'm not a baby.
3352350 3353339 [clucking]
3353418 3356819 Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?<br />All right. I'll do something.
3363862 3366797 [snoring]
3374600 3377960 - [revving engine]<br />- Oh!

3498440 3502720 Besides, she can't stand me.<br />And I don't like her, to be honest.
3502800 3506680 Yeah, you probably right.<br />Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
3506760 3509480 - Where, where?<br />- [laughing]

3587560 3590800 [chuckling] Yeah,<br />maybe I'll use it in my big race.
3590880 3594400 What's so important<br />about this race of yours, anyway?
3595920 3599640 It's not just a race.<br />We're talking about the Piston Cup!
3599720 3602040 I've been dreaming about it<br />my whole life!

3617880 3621480 Well, I don't mean you, Mater.<br />I mean other old cars. You know?
3621560 3624720 - Not like you. I like you.<br />- It's OK, buddy.

4177200 4178600 Wheel Well.
4178640 4181920 Used to be the most popular stop<br />on the mother road.
4186560 4188280 This place?
4188360 4190360 [horns beeping]
4191920 4193960 [Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.
4195640 4198360 Oh, imagine what<br />it must have been like to stay here.

4202360 4205560 How does a Porsche<br />wind up in a place like this?
4205640 4207840 Well, it's really pretty simple.<br />I was...

4215800 4219200 - What?<br />- Just... clues to the puzzle.
4219960 4222600 Yeah, OK.<br />Well, that was my life.
4222680 4224440 And you know what?
4224520 4228120 It never felt... happy.
4229760 4232880 Yeah. I mean... really?
4232960 4234680 Yeah. So I left California.
4234760 4238040 Just drove and drove<br />and finally broke down right here.
4238800 4241560 Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
4241640 4244640 Well, they all did. And I never left.
4245920 4247600 Yeah. You know, I understand.
4247680 4250520 You need a little R and R.<br />Recharge the old batteries.
4250600 4254320 But you know, after a while,<br />why didn't you go back?
4255280 4258760 [inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

4293480 4295680 They don't even know<br />what they're missing!
4296680 4299000 [Sally] Well,<br />it didn't used to be that way.
4300480 4301800 Oh, yeah?
4301880 4305760 Yeah. Forty years ago,<br />that Interstate down there didn't exist.
4306920 4307920 Really?
4308000 4310680 [Sally] Yeah. Back then,
4310760 4313640 cars came across the country<br />a whole different way.
4314880 4316240 How do you mean?
4316280 4319680 The road didn't cut through the land<br />like that Interstate.
4319760 4323960 It moved with the land, you know?<br />It rose, it fell, it curved.
4325480 4327440 - Mornin'!<br />- Nice day, huh?
4329360 4332160 Cars didn't drive on it<br />to make great time.

4460920 4464480 [Lightning] How great would it have been<br />to see this place in its heyday!

5236880 5239480 Not that. That.
5239560 5239600 [Sally gasps] Customers?
5239640 5241960 [Sally gasps] Customers?
5242000 5244680 Customers, everybody!<br />And a lot of 'em!
5244760 5246920 You know what to do.<br />Just like we rehearsed.
5247000 5247960 [all gasp]
5248040 5250640 It's the ghostlight!
5250720 5253320 We have found McQueen.<br />We have found McQueen!
5254200 5255680 McQueen, over here!
5255720 5258480 - Wait, excuse me.<br />- Is it true you've been in rehab?
5258560 5260680 - Did you have a nervous breakdown?<br />- What?
5260760 5263480 - McQueen's wearing whitewalls!<br />- Your tires balding?
5263560 5264560 [Sally] Stickers!
5264640 5266800 - Was McQueen your prisoner?<br />- Shoot, no!
5266880 5269360 We're best buds!<br />I ain't braggin' or nothin',
5269400 5272600 but I was in charge of huntin' him down<br />if he tried to escape.
5272680 5274280 Sally! Sally!
5274360 5276400 Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
5276480 5278200 - Stickers?<br />- Sally!
5278280 5280680 - Come on, give us some bolt!<br />- [horn honking]
5280760 5285240 You're here!<br />Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!
5285320 5288680 - Mack?<br />- You're here! I can't believe it!
5288760 5292640 [chuckling] You are a sight<br />for sore headlights!
5292720 5295440 I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.<br />I'll make it up to you!
5295520 5297360 Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.
5297440 5300040 <i>[Harv] Is that the world's</i><br /><i>fastest racing machine?</i>
5300120 5302640 - Is that Harv?<br />- Yeah. He's in the back.
5304240 5307200 - Show us the bolt!<br />- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!
5307240 5310520 - Where's the old McQueen?<br />- Actually, this is my good side here.

5330240 5332720 <i>That's just a figure of speech,</i><br /><i>by the way. You signed a contract.</i>
5332760 5335080 <i>Where are you?</i><br /><i>I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>
5335160 5337680 I'm in this little town<br />called Radiator Springs.

5376080 5378880 Sally, I... I want you to...
5379520 5382600 Look, I wish... [sighs]
5384080 5386960 Thank you. Thanks for everything.
5387040 5389040 [groans, chuckles]
5389120 5394320 - It was just a road.<br />- No. It was much more than that.
5397480 5400680 Hey, kid! We gotta go.<br />Harv's goin' crazy!
5400760 5403960 He's gonna have me fired if<br />I don't get you in the truck right now!
5404040 5406760 - Mack, just... hold it for...<br />- You should go.
5406840 5409080 - I know, but...<br />- Good luck in California.
5411440 5414480 I hope you find<br />what you're looking for.
5414560 5416640 - McQueen, come on!<br />- Sally...

5456000 5458400 - Yeah.<br />- Thanks for the call.
5466880 5470600 - You called them?<br />- It's best for everyone, Sally.
5471240 5474360 Best for everyone or best for you?
5490880 5493680 I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
5539280 5541560 [light buzzing]
5553240 5556560 [Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome<br />to what has become, quite simply,
5556640 5558920 the biggest event<br />in the history of racing.
5559000 5561240 A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
5561320 5563760 [Darrell] There's a crowd<br />of nearly 200,000 cars
5563840 5566400 here at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway.
5566480 5570800 Tickets to this race are hotter than a<br />black leather seat on a hot summer day!
5570880 5573440 [Bob] The King, Chick Hicks<br />and Lightning McQueen
5573520 5576840 in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,<br />tiebreaker race.
5576920 5580160 [Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,<br />but let me tell you somethin'.
5580240 5584200 I never thought I'd see anything<br />like this. This is exciting!
5584280 5586640 [Bob] In fact, the country<br />has almost shut down
5586680 5590800 to watch what many experts<br />are calling "the race of the century."
5590880 5593480 Hey, King!<br />Good luck in your last race.
5593560 5597680 - You've sure been an inspiration to me.<br />- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
5597720 5600840 - Hey, be careful out there, OK?<br />- Yeah, man.
5600920 5601880 [Mia] He's hot!
5601960 5604640 Wanna know the forecast?<br />I'll give you the forecast.
5604720 5607800 A 100 percent chance of thunder!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5607880 5610400 Say it with me!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5610480 5613400 Hey, you! No admittance<br />without a garage pass.
5613480 5616240 Oh, it's OK.<br />Lightning McQueen knows me!
5616320 5619440 Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day<br />for a race, isn't it?
5619520 5624480 - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.<br />- And good morning to you, Fred.
5624560 5628480 Mario Andretti knows my name!<br />You gotta let me in now!
5628520 5629800 [guard] Sorry, pal.
5629880 5634120 [Lightning] OK, here we go.<br />Focus. Speed.
5634920 5637720 I am speed.
5637760 5639360 [cars whizzing]
5639440 5640640 Victory.
5640720 5642840 One winner, two losers.
5642920 5644880 [engine revving]
5644960 5650480 Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
5650560 5653120 [birds singing]
5654600 5655600 [knock on door]
5655680 5657240 [Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?
5657320 5660040 [gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
5663320 5666280 [indistinct chatter]
5673400 5676200 Mack, thanks for being<br />my pit crew today.
5676280 5678880 Don't worry about it, kid.<br />It's the least I could do.
5678960 5681360 After all, "Gas Can"<br />is my middle name.
5681440 5683800 - It is?<br />- Ah... Not really.
5689160 5691160 [all shouting]
5691240 5692960 [gulping]
5701080 5702480 Uh-oh
5706480 5709120 - [cheering, laughing]<br />- [giggling]
5713360 5716320 Nelson! Zoom in.<br />Ready, 16? Take 16.
5716480 5718720 [Bob] And there he is,<br />Lightning McQueen!
5718800 5721920 Missing all week, and then he turns up<br />in the middle of nowhere!
5722000 5724400 In a little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
5724480 5727520 [Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,<br />of all things.
5728680 5731800 - Oh!<br />- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5731880 5733040 [chuckling]
5733120 5735440 Hey, where you been?<br />I've been kinda lonely.
5735520 5738400 Nobody to hang out with.<br />I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
5738480 5741480 And the twins. Of course.<br />The ones that used to be your fans,
5741560 5744720 but now they're my fans.<br />Listen to what the twins think...
5751560 5753600 Agh! Shoot!
5753680 5756840 [Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,<br />boys! Let's go racin'!
5760480 5763000 [crowd cheering]
5763120 5764680 Come on, you can do it!
5764720 5766760 Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
5767960 5771160 [Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King<br />is still holding a slim lead.
5771240 5774480 [Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!<br />He's lookin' to the inside!
5776640 5778800 Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
5778880 5781280 [Bob] Chick's not<br />making it easy on him today.
5781360 5783080 [Darrell] He lost momentum,
5783160 5785440 and now he's gonna have to<br />chase him back down!
5789360 5792360 - [soft music]<br />- [birds singing]
5793720 5794800 [breaks squealing]
5794880 5796920 [Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!
5797000 5798040 [all gasp]
5800920 5803520 [chuckling] Just me<br />and the old man, fellas.
5803560 5807120 - McQueen just doesn't have it today.<br />- [all laugh]
5807200 5808200 [groans]
5808280 5812360 - Hey, kid, are you all right?<br />- I don't know, Mack.
5812400 5813840 I don't think I...
5813920 5816640 [Doc] I didn't come all this way<br />to see you quit.
5816880 5818400 Doc?
5821080 5823720 Guys, you're here!<br />I can't believe this!
5823800 5827560 I knew you needed a crew chief,<br />but I didn't know it was this bad.
5827640 5829520 You said you'd never come back.
5829600 5833200 Well, I really didn't have a choice.<br />Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
5833280 5836160 Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
5836240 5838120 [chuckles]
5840160 5843640 All right, if you can drive as good<br />as you can fix a road
5843720 5847000 then you can win this race<br />with your eyes shut.
5847040 5849040 Now, get back out there!
5851280 5854280 Hot snot, we are back in business!<br />Guido! Luigi!
5854320 5856640 You're goin' up<br />against professional pit crews.
5856680 5859880 - You're gonna have to be fast.<br />- They will not know what bit them!
5859920 5861640 Kid, you can beat these guys.
5861720 5865120 Find a groove that works for you<br />and get that lap back.
5874360 5876760 [murmuring]
5876800 5878720 - Is it?<br />- Oh, wow. That's him!
5878800 5882560 Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!<br />The Hudson Hornet's back!
5882640 5885240 [Bob] It appears McQueen<br />has got himself a pit crew.
5885320 5887720 And look who he has for a crew chief!
5887800 5890480 - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Whoa!
5890560 5893880 Well, dip me in axle grease<br />and call me Slick! It surely is.
5896360 5898480 [crowd cheering]
5898520 5900560 <i>[Bob] Wow, this is history</i><br /><i>in the making.</i>
5900640 5903560 <i>Nobody has seen the racing legend</i><br /><i>in over 50 years!</i>
5903600 5905000 Hey, Doc!
5905080 5909240 Come look at this fellow on the radio.<br />He looks just like you.
5914160 5917960 - [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!<br />- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.
5918040 5920920 [Bob] Can he catch up to them<br />with only 60 laps to go?
5921000 5923880 You're goin' great, kid.<br />Just keep your head on.
5923960 5925560 <i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>
5925640 5928520 Hey, shrimpie,<br />where did McQueen find you, huh?
5928600 5932040 Those round things are called tires,<br />and they go under the car!
5932120 5933120 [all laugh]
5933200 5935800 <i>Con chi credi di parlare?</i><br /><i>Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>
5935880 5939040 No! No, no! You'll have your chance.<br />You will have your chance.
5953480 5956280 Oh, kid's just tryin'<br />to be a hero, huh?
5957880 5959120 What do you think of this?
5959200 5961360 - [tires squealing]<br />- Yeah, that's it, kid.
5964680 5965960 What?
5966040 5967840 Whoa! Git-R-done!
5969600 5973880 - [laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!<br />- Ah!
5973960 5976920 [Bob] What a move by McQueen!<br />He's caught up to the leaders.
5977000 5978800 Yeah. This is what it's all about.
5978880 5982040 A three-way battle for the lead,<br />with ten to go!
5985680 5988880 [chortling]<br />Look at that boy go out there!
5994600 5996880 [Chick] Oh! [grunting]
5997840 5999400 No, you don't.
6000560 6002400 [tire blows]
6002480 6004480 Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
6004560 6008000 - Can you get back to the pits?<br />- Yeah, yeah. I think so.
6008040 6011360 Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.<br />Don't tear yourself up, kid.
6013280 6015400 [Mack] We gotta get him<br />back out there fast
6015480 6018440 or we're gonna be a lap down,<br />and we'll never win this race!
6018480 6020640 Guido! It's time.
6024920 6028040 Hey, tiny,<br />you gonna clean his windshield?
6030640 6033120 [air wrench whirring]
6037160 6038560 [Darrell] I don't believe it!
6038640 6040360 [Bob] That was<br />the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
6040400 6042960 [Darrell] It was a great stop,<br />but he's still gotta beat that pace car!
6043040 6044760 [Bob] It's gonna be close.
6046400 6048880 - Yeah, baby!<br />- [all hollering]
6048960 6050320 <i>[Darrell] He's back in!</i>
6051640 6052640 Peet stop.
6054080 6056040 - Guido, you did it!<br />- Way to go, Guido!
6071320 6074360 [Bob] This is it. We're heading into<br />the final lap and McQueen
6074440 6076800 is right behind the leaders.<br />What a comeback!
6076880 6080400 [Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine<br />laps! It all comes down to this!
6080480 6081760 This is it, kiddo.
6081840 6084320 You've got four turns left.<br />One at a time.
6084400 6086840 Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.
6086880 6088280 - Go!<br />- [revving]
6091000 6092120 We'll see about that!
6093640 6095200 [Bob] McQueen's going inside!
6098160 6101200 - Chick and King are loose!<br />- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!
6111880 6114360 - McQueen saved it!<br />- [Bob] He's back on the track!
6114760 6117400 - Float like a Cadillac...<br />- Sting like a Beemer!
6118480 6122120 - Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...<br />- [all cheer]
6123680 6126680 [Darrell] Lightning McQueen<br />is gonna win the Piston Cup!
6126760 6128880 Come on! You got it!<br />You got it, Stickers!
6130360 6134160 [grunts] I am not comin' in<br />behind you again, old man.
6144520 6146400 - Oh, no!<br />- [crowd gasps]
6155680 6157840 [breaks screeching]
6160320 6161600 [engine idling]
6164920 6167120 Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
6167200 6170920 I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
6172240 6174360 [Flo] What's he up to, Doc?
6182680 6184680 [grunting, moaning]
6184760 6186120 What are you doin', kid?
6186200 6189440 I think The King<br />should finish his last race.
6192600 6195600 You just gave up the Piston Cup,<br />you know that?
6195680 6199280 This grumpy old racecar I know<br />once told me somethin'.
6199320 6201400 It's just an empty cup.
6203520 6206080 [Bob] Darrell, is pushing<br />on the last lap legal?
6206160 6209800 He's not really pushin' him. He's<br />just givin' him a little bump draft.
6209880 6212200 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
6212240 6214960 Hey. What? What's goin' on?
6215040 6217280 - That's what I call racin'.<br />- [sobbing]

6312720 6314040 Hey, Lightnin'.
6314120 6316800 How 'bout comin' over here<br />and talk to me a minute?
6317680 6320720 Son, that was some<br />real racin' out there.
6320800 6323560 How'd you like to become<br />the new face of Dinoco?
6328280 6329720 But I didn't win.
6329800 6333480 Lightnin', there's a whole lot<br />more to racin' than just winnin'.

6340560 6342280 Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...
6342360 6346080 ...but these Rust-eze guys over there<br />gave me my big break.

6357720 6360240 I sure appreciate that.<br />Thank you.

6365440 6366440 Whoo-hoo!

6382760 6385040 I think it's about-a time<br />we redecorate.

6392760 6396960 How 'bout setting me and my friends up<br />with three or four sets each?
6397040 6402240 Guido! There is a real<br />Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

6437880 6441160 - I hear this place is back on the map.<br />- It is?
6441200 6445000 There's some rumor floating around<br />that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar
6445040 6447520 is setting up his big<br />racing headquarters here.
6447600 6450440 Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
6450480 6453000 You know, I really missed you, Sally.
