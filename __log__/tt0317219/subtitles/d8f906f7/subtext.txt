1411 3709 Come here, little tractor,<br />come here.
3780 6044 Yeah, that's a good tractor.
6116 7481 No, no, no, no, come here.
7551 8916 What are you doing?
8985 11681 You're not supposed to go<br />wandering off all...
11988 14354 ...alone.
24734 28966 What are you doin'<br />with those old racin' tires?
31542 35000 [Sighing heavily]
35646 37944 Come on, Doc, drive.
47959 50860 [Revs engine]
115829 117626 Ah... Yeah.
117698 119359 - Wow.<br />- Huh?
119433 121025 You're amazing!
123004 125268 [Coughing] What are you doin'?
125340 127035 Doc, wait!
129110 130839 [Trucks mooing]
130912 133346 Giddup right in there!<br />Come on, Rusty.
136251 139448 Doc, hold it!<br />Seriously, your driving's incredible!
139521 142820 - Wonderful. Now, go away.<br />- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
142891 144722 - I'm askin' you to leave.<br />- Come on.
144793 147785 I'm a racecar,<br />you're a much older racecar,
147863 149854 but under the hood<br />you and I are the same.
149932 152992 We are not the same!<br />Understand? Now, get out.
153069 156004 How could a car like you quit<br />at the top of your game?
157873 160341 You think I quit?
172923 174618 [Lightning] Right.
175258 177886 Your big wreck in '54.
178628 180926 They quit on me.
180997 184558 When I finally got put together,<br />I went back expecting a big welcome.
184634 187535 You know what they said?<br />"You're history."
187604 190664 Moved right on to<br />the next rookie standing in line.
193510 195740 There was a lot left in me.
196481 199473 I never got a chance to show 'em.
200985 205012 I keep that to remind me<br />never to go back.
206190 209353 I just never expected that<br />that world would...
209427 211622 ...would find me here.
212730 215324 - Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.<br />- Oh, yeah?
215399 216388 No, I'm not.
216467 220301 When is the last time you cared about<br />something except yourself, hot rod?
220372 224968 You name me one time<br />and I will take it all back.
226812 229804 Uh-huh. I didn't think so.
230215 233981 These are good folk around here,<br />who care about one another.
234620 237748 I don't want 'em depending<br />on someone they can't count on.
238323 240348 Oh, like you?<br />You've been here how long
240425 242655 and your friends<br />don't even know who you are?
243329 245388 Who's caring about only himself?
245465 248263 Just finish that road<br />and get outta here!
258244 260269 [Reveille plays]
260346 262337 [~ Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]
262415 265111 [Sarge] Will you turn that<br />disrespectful junk off?
265185 267619 [Fillmore] Respect the classics, man.
267688 270680 [Snoring]
270758 273818 [Snorts, putters]
273894 277295 [Grunting]
277364 280162 [Smacking] Ah...
294082 295447 [Mater] He's done.
295517 298748 He must've finished it<br />while we was all sleepin'.
298820 301050 Good riddance.
308930 310363 He's gone?
310432 313458 Well, we wouldn't want him<br />to miss that race of his.
316839 318830 [Sniffing]
318908 323242 - Oh, dude, are you crying?<br />- No! I'm happy!
323312 326281 I don't have to watch him<br />every second of the day anymore!
326349 327543 I'm glad he's gone!
327617 330415 [Blubbering, sobbing]
334156 335953 What's wrong with Red?
336025 339426 Oh, he's just sad<br />'cause you left town
339495 342430 and went to your big race to win<br />the Piston Cup
342499 345366 that you've always dreamed about<br />your whole life
345435 350964 and get that big ol' sponsor and that<br />fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
355612 357910 [Gasping] Wait a minute!
357981 359243 [All laugh]
359316 362149 I knowed you wouldn't leave<br />without saying goodbye.
362219 364949 What are you doin' here?<br />You're gonna miss your race.
365023 368686 Don't worry. I'll give you<br />a police escort, and we'll make up time.
368760 369920 Thank you, Sheriff.
369994 372121 But you know I can't go just yet.
372196 373686 Well, why not?
373765 376598 - I'm not sure these tires...<br />- [Luigi gasps excitedly]
376668 379569 ...can get me to California.<br />- Peet stop?
379637 382902 Yeah, does anybody know<br />what time Luigi's opens?
382974 384309 [Laughing] I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
384309 386140 [Laughing] I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
386344 388938 Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!
389014 393110 - Would you look at that!<br />- [Luigi] Our first customer in years!
393185 396780 I am filled with tears of ecstasy,
396855 400723 for this is the most glorious day<br />of my life!
400793 404786 All right, Luigi, give me<br />the best set of blackwalls you've got.
404997 406225 No! No, no, no.
406298 409665 You don't-a know what you want.<br />Luigi know what you want.
410803 415172 Blackwall tires.<br />They blend into the pavement.
415241 416708 But-a this...
417010 418841 Whitewall tires!
418912 424077 They say, "Look at me!<br />Here I am! Love me."
424150 425947 All right, you're the expert.
426019 428954 - [Snarling]<br />- [Lightning] Don't forget the spare.
429022 431855 - Perfetto. Guido!<br />- Peet stop!
431925 434223 [~ Chuck Berry: Route 66]
443237 446172 [Laughing] What did Luigi tell you, eh?
446240 449698 Wow, you were right.<br />Better than a Ferrari, huh?
450478 451638 Eh... No.
455516 459111 Wow! This organic fuel is great!<br />Why haven't I heard about it before?
459186 461177 It's a conspiracy, man!
461256 463724 The oil companies got a grip<br />on the government!
463792 467023 They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
467095 469222 OK, I'll take a case.
484279 485746 Ow! Eh!
485815 487077 [Lightning yelps]
489786 492516 - [Chuckles]<br />- [Breathes in deeply]
494590 496217 [Ramone] Ah... Yeah.
496759 498283 [Lightning] Ka-chow.
499162 502131 - Here she comes!<br />- [Lightning] Places, everybody. Hurry!
502198 503927 - Act natural.<br />- [Whistling]
504000 505331 - Hi, Sally.<br />- Buon giorno!
505401 507232 All right, what's goin' on?
507303 509464 Ladies and gentlecars,
509540 513476 please welcome<br />the new Lightning McQueen!
514111 516102 Pow! What do you think?
516180 518375 Radiator Springs<br />looks pretty good on me.
518449 520246 [Chuckling] I'll say.
520317 523514 [Purring] Ka-chow.
523587 526112 You're gonna fit right in<br />in California.
526990 530118 My goodness. It looks like<br />you've helped everybody in town.
530194 532025 Yeah, everybody except one.
533263 538257 - Hey, is it getting dark out?<br />- What? What'd he say?
538336 541362 Let me say that again.<br />Is it getting dark out?
541439 543634 Now, what was I<br />supposed to do after that?
543708 546006 [~ The Chords: Sh-Boom]
567633 570431 [Gasping] They fixed their neon!
577843 582837 - Low and slow?<br />- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]
582916 585510 [Flo laughs and shrieks]
587154 590487 Just like in its heyday, right?
590557 593924 It's even better than I pictured it.<br />Thank you.
615550 617916 [Chuckling]
621355 622788 Shall we cruise?
622857 625189 Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
625259 626726 - No, no, no.<br />- Lizzie!
626794 631128 I remember when Stanley<br />first asked me to take a drive with him.
631200 634067 Hey, Miss Sally.<br />May I have this cruise?
634136 637503 - Of course, Mater.<br />- Uh-uh-uh!
638941 641842 [Mooing]
643979 648348 ...and again and I said, "No."<br />He asked me again, and I said, "No."
648417 652751 But, oh, he was a persistent<br />little bugger for a two-cylinder.
652821 656222 Finally I said,<br />"All right, one little drive."
658394 661386 - Oh!<br />- [Mater chuckling]
665735 667862 - Hey!<br />- Thanks, Mater.
667937 670235 Good evenin', you two.
672742 677975 Oh, Stanley,<br />I wish you could see this.
682086 685886 - Is that what I think it is?<br />- Oh, I don't know, Flo.
685956 691622 I haven't had a chance to find out.<br />But I am going to find out. Hello.
691695 694289 Not that. That.
694365 694431 [Sally gasps] Customers?
694431 696763 [Sally gasps] Customers?
696834 699496 Customers, everybody!<br />And a lot of 'em!
699570 701731 You know what to do.<br />Just like we rehearsed.
701805 702794 [All gasp]
702874 705468 It's the ghostlight!
705543 708137 We have found McQueen.<br />We have found McQueen!
709014 710481 McQueen, over here!
710548 713312 - Wait, excuse me.<br />- Is it true you've been in rehab?
713385 715512 - Did you have a nervous breakdown?<br />- What?
715587 718317 - McQueen's wearing whitewalls!<br />- Your tires balding?
718390 719379 [Sally] Stickers!
719457 721618 - Was McQueen your prisoner?<br />- Shoot, no!
721693 724161 We're best buds!<br />I ain't braggin' or nothin',
724229 727426 but I was in charge of huntin' him down<br />if he tried to escape.
727500 729092 Sally! Sally!
729168 731227 Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
731304 733033 - Stickers?<br />- Sally!
733105 735505 - Come on, give us some bolt!<br />- [Horn honking]
735574 740068 You're here!<br />Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!
740146 743513 - Mack?<br />- You're here! I can't believe it!
743582 747450 [Chuckling] You are a sight<br />for sore headlights!
747520 750250 I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.<br />I'll make it up to you!
750323 752188 Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.
752259 754853 [Harv] Is that the world's<br />fastest racing machine?
754928 757453 - Is that Harv?<br />- Yeah. He's in the back.
759066 762001 - Show us the bolt!<br />- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!
762069 765334 - Where's the old McQueen?<br />- Actually, this is my good side here.
765639 767664 - Harv! Harv!<br />- Give us the bolt!
768608 769597 - Harv?<br />- Come on!
769676 772372 - Kid, I'm over here!<br />- How you doin', buddy?
772446 775108 My star client disappears<br />off the face of the earth!
775182 777377 - How do you think I'm doing?<br />- I can explain.
777452 781855 I'm doing great! You're everywhere!<br />Radio, TV, the papers!
781923 784983 You can't buy this kind of publicity!<br />What do you need me for?
785059 787527 That's just a figure of speech,<br />by the way. You signed a contract.
787595 789893 Where are you?<br />I can't even find you on my GPS.
789964 792489 I'm in this little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
792600 795763 - You know Route 66? It's still here!<br />- Yeah, that's great, kid.
795837 797031 Playtime is over, pal.
797105 800939 While the world's been trying to<br />find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.
801009 802704 - Who are they gonna woo?<br />- Chick!
802778 806407 Bingo. In fact, check out<br />what's on the plasma right now.
806482 808643 - Show us the thunder!<br />- You want thunder?
808717 812346 You want thunder?<br />Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!
812421 815686 - Hey, that's my bit!<br />- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!
815758 819751 Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,<br />or Dinoco is history, you hear me?
819828 821557 Just give me a second here, Harv.
821730 823425 No, wait. Where are you goin'?
823499 826764 Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!<br />You want a bigger trailer?
830907 833705 Sally, I... I want you to...
834344 837438 Look, I wish... [sighs]
838915 841782 Thank you. Thanks for everything.
841851 843876 [Groans, chuckles]
843953 849152 - It was just a road.<br />- No. It was much more than that.
852296 855493 Hey, kid! We gotta go.<br />Harv's goin' crazy!
855566 858797 He's gonna have me fired if<br />I don't get you in the truck right now!
858869 861599 - Mack, just... hold it for...<br />- You should go.
861672 863902 - I know, but...<br />- Good luck in California.
866277 869303 I hope you find<br />what you're looking for.
869380 871473 - McQueen, come on!<br />- Sally...
871549 874780 - Sally!<br />- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!
874853 876946 Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!
882794 885558 - Come on, get in the trailer.<br />- Where's the old McQueen?
885630 887996 - The bolt!<br />- That's it. That's right, let's go!
888066 890762 You're a big shining star.<br />You're a superstar.
890836 893134 You don't belong there, anyway.
893205 896197 Whoa... Wait...<br />Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!
896676 898940 [Engine starts]
899011 901241 Hey, guys!<br />McQueen's leavin' in the truck!
908387 910753 Hey, are you Doc Hudson?
910823 913223 - Yeah.<br />- Thanks for the call.
921702 925433 - You called them?<br />- It's best for everyone, Sally.
926073 929201 Best for everyone or best for you?
945693 948491 I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
994110 996374 [Light buzzing]
1008058 1011391 [Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome<br />to what has become, quite simply,
1011461 1013759 the biggest event<br />in the history of racing.
1013830 1016060 A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
1016132 1018600 [Darrell] There's a crowd<br />of nearly 200,000 cars
1018669 1021229 here at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway.
1021305 1025639 Tickets to this race are hotter than a<br />black leather seat on a hot summer day!
1025710 1028270 [Bob] The King, Chick Hicks<br />and Lightning McQueen
1028346 1031679 in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,<br />tiebreaker race.
1031749 1034980 [Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,<br />but let me tell you somethin'.
1035052 1039045 I never thought I'd see anything<br />like this. This is exciting!
1039123 1041455 [Bob] In fact, the country<br />has almost shut down
1041526 1045622 to watch what many experts<br />are calling "the race of the century."
1045697 1048325 Hey, King!<br />Good luck in your last race.
1048400 1052496 - You've sure been an inspiration to me.<br />- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
1052571 1055665 - Hey, be careful out there, OK?<br />- Yeah, man.
1055741 1056730 [Mia] He's hot!

1065317 1068252 Hey, you! No admittance<br />without a garage pass.
1068321 1071085 Oh, it's OK.<br />Lightning McQueen knows me!
1071157 1074285 Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day<br />for a race, isn't it?
1074360 1079320 - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.<br />- And good morning to you, Fred.
1079399 1083301 Mario Andretti knows my name!<br />You gotta let me in now!
1083369 1084631 [Guard] Sorry, pal.
1084704 1088970 [Lightning] OK, here we go.<br />Focus. Speed.
1089742 1092540 I am speed.

1097751 1099719 [Engine revving]
1099787 1105316 Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
1105392 1107952 [birds singing]
1109430 1110419 [Knock on door]
1110497 1112089 [Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?
1112166 1114862 [Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
1118139 1121131 [Indistinct chatter]
1128216 1131049 Mack, thanks for being<br />my pit crew today.
1131119 1133713 Don't worry about it, kid.<br />It's the least I could do.
1133788 1136188 After all, "Gas Can"<br />is my middle name.
1136257 1138623 - It is?<br />- Ah... Not really.
1143999 1145990 [All shouting]
1146068 1147797 [Gulping]
1155911 1157310 Uh-oh
1161317 1163945 - [cheering, laughing]<br />- [Giggling]
1168191 1171160 Nelson! Zoom in.<br />Ready, 16? Take 16.
1171328 1173558 [Bob] And there he is,<br />Lightning McQueen!
1173630 1176758 Missing all week, and then he turns up<br />in the middle of nowhere!
1176833 1179233 In a little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
1179302 1182362 [Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,<br />of all things.
1183507 1186635 - Oh!<br />- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
1186711 1187871 [Chuckling]
1187945 1190277 Hey, where you been?<br />I've been kinda lonely.
1190348 1193249 Nobody to hang out with.<br />I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
1193317 1196309 And the twins. Of course.<br />The ones that used to be your fans,
1196387 1199550 but now they're my fans.<br />Listen to what the twins think...
1206397 1208456 Agh! Shoot!
1208533 1211661 [Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,<br />boys! Let's go racin'!
1215307 1217832 [Crowd cheering]
1217943 1219501 Come on, you can do it!
1219578 1221603 Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
1222815 1226012 [Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King<br />is still holding a slim lead.
1226084 1229315 [Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!<br />He's lookin' to the inside!
1231490 1233651 Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
1233725 1236125 [Bob] Chick's not<br />making it easy on him today.
1236196 1237925 [Darrell] He lost momentum,
1237997 1240295 and now he's gonna have to<br />chase him back down!
1244204 1247196 - [Soft music]<br />- [Birds singing]
1248541 1249633 [Breaks squealing]
1249709 1251768 [Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!
1251845 1252869 [All gasp]
1255748 1258342 [Chuckling] Just me<br />and the old man, fellas.
1258418 1261945 - McQueen just doesn't have it today.<br />- [All laugh]
1262022 1263046 [Groans]
1263123 1267184 - Hey, kid, are you all right?<br />- I don't know, Mack.
1267261 1268694 I don't think I...
1268762 1271492 [Doc] I didn't come all this way<br />to see you quit.
1271732 1273256 Doc?
1275936 1278564 Guys, you're here!<br />I can't believe this!
1278639 1282405 I knew you needed a crew chief,<br />but I didn't know it was this bad.
1282476 1284376 You said you'd never come back.
1284446 1288041 Well, I really didn't have a choice.<br />Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
1288116 1291017 Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
1291086 1292951 [Chuckles]
1294990 1298482 All right, if you can drive as good<br />as you can fix a road
1298560 1301825 then you can win this race<br />with your eyes shut.
1301897 1303888 Now, get back out there!
1306134 1309103 Hot snot, we are back in business!<br />Guido! Luigi!
1309171 1311469 You're goin' up<br />against professional pit crews.
1311540 1314703 - You're gonna have to be fast.<br />- They will not know what bit them!
1314777 1316472 Kid, you can beat these guys.
1316545 1319946 Find a groove that works for you<br />and get that lap back.
1329191 1331591 [Murmuring]
1331661 1333561 - Is it?<br />- Oh, wow. That's him!
1333630 1337396 Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!<br />The Hudson Hornet's back!
1337467 1340095 [Bob] It appears McQueen<br />has got himself a pit crew.
1340170 1342570 And look who he has for a crew chief!
1342639 1345335 - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Whoa!
1345409 1348742 Well, dip me in axle grease<br />and call me Slick! It surely is.
1351214 1353307 [Crowd cheering]
1353383 1355408 [Bob] Wow, this is history<br />in the making.
1355485 1358386 Nobody has seen the racing legend<br />in over 50 years!
1358456 1359855 Hey, Doc!
1359924 1364088 Come look at this fellow on the radio.<br />He looks just like you.
1369000 1372800 - [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!<br />- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.
1372870 1375771 [Bob] Can he catch up to them<br />with only 60 laps to go?
1375840 1378741 You're goin' great, kid.<br />Just keep your head on.
1378810 1380402 Vai! Vai, vai!
1380479 1383380 Hey, shrimpie,<br />where did McQueen find you, huh?
1383449 1386885 Those round things are called tires,<br />and they go under the car!
1386952 1387976 [All laugh]
1388053 1390647 Con chi credi di parlare?<br />Ma, con chi stai parlando?
1390723 1393886 No! No, no! You'll have your chance.<br />You will have your chance.
1408341 1411139 Oh, kid's just tryin'<br />to be a hero, huh?
1412712 1413974 What do you think of this?
1414047 1416208 - [Tires squealing]<br />- Yeah, that's it, kid.
1419519 1420816 What?
1420887 1422684 Whoa! Git-R-done!
1424457 1428723 - [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!<br />- Ah!
1428796 1431765 [Bob] What a move by McQueen!<br />He's caught up to the leaders.
1431832 1433663 Yeah. This is what it's all about.
1433734 1436897 A three-way battle for the lead,<br />with ten to go!
1440541 1443738 [Chortling]<br />Look at that boy go out there!
1449450 1451748 [Chick] Oh! [grunting]
1452687 1454245 No, you don't.
1455390 1457255 [Tire blows]
1457325 1459316 Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
1459394 1462830 - Can you get back to the pits?<br />- Yeah, yeah. I think so.
1462898 1466197 Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.<br />Don't tear yourself up, kid.
1468136 1470263 [Mack] We gotta get him<br />back out there fast
1470338 1473273 or we're gonna be a lap down,<br />and we'll never win this race!
1473341 1475502 Guido! It's time.
1479782 1482876 Hey, tiny,<br />you gonna clean his windshield?
1485488 1487979 [Air wrench whirring]
1491994 1493427 [Darrell] I don't believe it!
1493496 1495191 [Bob] That was<br />the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
1495264 1497824 [Darrell] It was a great stop,<br />but he's still gotta beat that pace car!
1497900 1499595 [Bob] It's gonna be close.
1501271 1503739 - Yeah, baby!<br />- [All hollering]
1503807 1505172 [Darrell] He's back in!
1506510 1507499 Peet stop.
1508946 1510880 - Guido, you did it!<br />- Way to go, Guido!
1526164 1529224 [Bob] This is it. We're heading into<br />the final lap and McQueen
1529300 1531666 is right behind the leaders.<br />What a comeback!
1531736 1535263 [Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine<br />laps! It all comes down to this!
1535340 1536602 This is it, kiddo.
1536674 1539165 You've got four turns left.<br />One at a time.
1539244 1541678 Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.
1541746 1543145 - Go!<br />- [Revving]
1545850 1546976 We'll see about that!
1548486 1550044 [Bob] McQueen's going inside!
1553025 1556051 - Chick and King are loose!<br />- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!
1566739 1569207 - McQueen saved it!<br />- [Bob] He's back on the track!
1569608 1572270 - Float like a Cadillac...<br />- Sting like a Beemer!
1573345 1576974 - Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...<br />- [all cheer]
1578552 1581544 [Darrell] Lightning McQueen<br />is gonna win the Piston Cup!
1581621 1583714 Come on! You got it!<br />You got it, Stickers!
1585225 1589025 [Grunts] I am not comin' in<br />behind you again, old man.
1599373 1601273 - Oh, no!<br />- [Crowd gasps]
1610551 1612712 [Breaks screeching]
1615156 1616453 [Engine idling]
1619794 1621989 Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
1622064 1625795 I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
1627102 1629229 [Flo] What's he up to, Doc?
1637546 1639537 [Grunting, moaning]
1639615 1640980 What are you doin', kid?
1641049 1644280 I think The King<br />should finish his last race.
1647457 1650449 You just gave up the Piston Cup,<br />you know that?
1650526 1654121 This grumpy old racecar I know<br />once told me somethin'.
1654197 1656256 It's just an empty cup.
1658368 1660928 [Bob] Darrell, is pushing<br />on the last lap legal?
1661004 1664667 He's not really pushin' him. He's<br />just givin' him a little bump draft.
1664741 1667039 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
1667110 1669806 Hey. What? What's goin' on?
1669879 1672143 - That's what I call racin'.<br />- [Sobbing]
1672216 1673683 [Laughing]
1675686 1678678 [Crowd cheers wildly]
1688098 1691158 - Bravo il mio amico!<br />- Way to go, buddy!
1691235 1693829 There's a lotta love out there,<br />you know, man?
1693904 1698432 - Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.<br />- That's my hot rod.
1700478 1703914 Come on, baby, bring it out!<br />Bring out the Piston Cup!
1703982 1705381 Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
1705450 1708419 Yeah!<br />Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
1708486 1711614 Hey, how come the only one celebrating<br />is me, huh?
1711690 1713920 Where are the girls?<br />Bring on the confetti!
1713992 1717587 Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.<br />What's goin' on?
1717662 1720961 Come on, snap some pictures.<br />I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!
1721033 1722500 Say it with me. Ka-chicka!
1722668 1724192 - Boo!<br />- Boo!
1724270 1727364 What's wrong with everybody?<br />Where's the happiness?
1727440 1729533 Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!
1735448 1737939 - Thanks, Lightnin'.<br />- You're welcome.
1740353 1742787 - Way to go, King!<br />- You're still the car!
1742856 1744847 You're The King! Yeah!
1745359 1747623 [Crowd cheers]
1752366 1755199 [Laughing and cheering]
1755268 1758726 - You made us proud, kid!<br />- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
1761942 1764570 You got a lotta stuff, kid.
1764778 1766439 Thanks, Doc.
1767582 1768913 Hey, Lightnin'.
1768983 1771645 How 'bout comin' over here<br />and talk to me a minute?
1772553 1775579 Son, that was some<br />real racin' out there.
1775656 1778420 How'd you like to become<br />the new face of Dinoco?
1783131 1784598 But I didn't win.
1784665 1788328 Lightnin', there's a whole lot<br />more to racin' than just winnin'.
1788403 1791099 [Clank] He was so rusty,<br />when he drove down the street
1791172 1795336 - buzzards used to circle the car!<br />- [All laugh]
1795411 1797140 Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...
1797212 1800943 ...but these Rust-eze guys over there<br />gave me my big break.
1802484 1804213 I'm gonna stick with them.
1804286 1807346 Well, I sure can respect that.
1807423 1808583 Still, you know,
1808657 1812525 if there's ever anything<br />I can do for you, just let me know.
1812594 1815119 I sure appreciate that.<br />Thank you.
1816599 1819591 Actually, there is one thing.
1820303 1821304 Whoo-hoo!
1821304 1822532 Whoo-hoo!
1822605 1826473 Hey, look at me!<br />I'm flyin', by golly!
1830980 1833972 I'm happier than a tornado<br />in a trailer park!
1837620 1839918 I think it's about-a time<br />we redecorate.
1843060 1846496 Hi. Lightning McQueen told me<br />this was the best place in the world
1846564 1847553 to get tires.
1847631 1851829 How 'bout setting me and my friends up<br />with three or four sets each?
1851902 1857101 Guido! There is a real<br />Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.
1857174 1859472 A real Ferrari!
1859543 1861670 Punch me, Guido.<br />Punch me in the face.
1861745 1865203 This is the most glorious day<br />of my life.
1866518 1870079 Wow. [Italian]<br />Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.
1870155 1872487 Mi dicono che siete fantastici.
1881867 1886133 - [Sighing]<br />- [Engine revving]
1886505 1888700 [Both chuckle]
1888774 1890298 Just passin' through?
1890376 1892674 Actually, I thought I'd stop<br />and stay awhile.
1892745 1896010 - I hear this place is back on the map.<br />- It is?
1896082 1899848 There's some rumor floating around<br />that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar
1899919 1902387 is setting up his big<br />racing headquarters here.
1902455 1905288 Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
1905358 1907849 You know, I really missed you, Sally.
1907927 1912057 Well, I create feelings in others<br />they themselves don't understand and,
1912131 1914292 - blah, blah, blah.<br />- [Lightning chuckles]
1914701 1917693 McQueen and Sally<br />parked beneath the tree,
1917771 1922401 K-i-s-s...uh... i-n-t!
1922776 1924744 Great timing, Mater!
1924811 1928804 Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!
1928882 1931316 He's my best friend.<br />What're you gonna do?
1931385 1934320 So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?
1934388 1937084 I don't know.<br />Why don't we just take a drive?
1937158 1939752 Hmm... Nah.
