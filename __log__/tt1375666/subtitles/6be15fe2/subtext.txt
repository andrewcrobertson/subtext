129250 134250 Are you here to kill me?
139670 143220 I know what this is.
143220 148220 I've seen one before.<br />Many, many years ago.
150020 155020 It belonged to a man I met<br />in a half-remembered dream.
156900 161900 A man possessed of<br />some radical notions.
165870 169040 COBB: What is the<br />most resilient parasite?
169040 172960 A bacteria? A virus?
172960 174540 An intestinal worm?
175960 177750 What Mr. Cobb<br />is trying to say...
177750 180260 An idea.
180260 182930 Resilient. Highly contagious.
182930 187930 Once an idea has taken hold of the<br />brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.
188010 191810 An idea that is fully formed,<br />fully understood, that sticks.
191810 193230 Right in there somewhere.
193230 194940 For someone like you to steal?
194940 198070 Yes. In the dream state, your<br />conscious defenses are lowered...
198070 200650 and that makes your<br />thoughts vulnerable to theft.
200650 202070 It's called extraction.
202070 205780 Mr. Saito, we can train your<br />subconscious to defend itself...
205780 208450 from even the most<br />skilled extractor.
208450 209790 How can you do that?
209790 213080 Because I am the<br />most skilled extractor.
213080 216670 I know how to search your mind<br />and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
216670 219750 And I can teach them to you,<br />so that even when you're asleep...
219750 223010 your defense is never down.
223010 227090 Look, if you want my help, you're gonna<br />have to be completely open with me.
227100 230600 I need to know my way around<br />your thoughts better than your wife...
230600 233350 better than your therapist,<br />better than anyone.
233350 236190 If this is a dream, and you<br />have a safe full of secrets...
236190 238690 I need to know<br />what's in that safe.
238690 243690 In order for this all to work,<br />you need to completely let me in.
245030 250030 Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,<br />as I consider your proposal.
252120 253330 He knows.
256210 261210 What's going on up there?
311930 314930 Saito knows. He's<br />playing with us.
314930 317430 Doesn't matter. I can<br />get it here. Trust me.
317440 319100 The information is in the safe.
319100 322650 He looked right at it<br />when I mentioned secrets.
322650 326610 What's she doing here?
326610 329660 Just head back to the room.<br />All right? I'll take care of this.
329660 334660 Okay, make sure you<br />do. We're here to work.
340130 345130 If I jumped, would I survive?
347170 349720 With a clean dive, perhaps.
349720 351550 Mal, what are you doing here?
351550 354050 I thought you might<br />be missing me.
354060 356770 COBB: You know that I am.
356770 359980 But I can't trust you anymore.
359980 362900 So what?
362900 365270 MAL: Looks like Arthur's taste.
365280 370280 Actually, the subject is partial<br />to postwar British painters.
370610 375610 Please, have a seat.
380080 381920 MAL: Tell me...
381920 386920 do the children miss me?
387800 392800 You can't imagine.
393680 394930 What are you doing?
394930 396890 Just getting some fresh air.
396890 401890 Stay where you are, Mal.
412360 417360 Goddamn it.
476050 477800 SAITO: Turn around.
477800 482800 The gun, Dom.
488110 489110 Please.
501370 504120 Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
504120 507960 Did she tell you? Or<br />have you known all along?
507960 512960 That you're here to steal from<br />me, or that we are actually asleep?
517050 521430 I want to know the<br />name of your employer.
521430 525480 There's no use threatening<br />him in a dream, right, Mal?
525480 528850 Thatdepends on what<br />you're threatening.
528860 531770 Killing him would<br />just wake him up.
531770 534610 But pain...
536910 539490 Pain is in the mind.
539490 544490 And judging by the decor, we're<br />in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
555090 558380 - What are you doing? It's too soon.<br />- But the dream's collapsing.
558380 562220 I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a<br />little bit longer. We're almost there.
576030 581030 He was close. Very close.
594300 595300 Stop him!
621700 626700 This isn't gonna<br />work. Wake him up.
644680 649680 He won't wake.
651100 652940 - Give him the kick.<br />NASH: What?
652940 654150 Dunk him.
698520 701900 COBB: He's out.
705200 707410 You came prepared?
707410 711910 Not even my head of security knows<br />this apartment. How did you find it?
711910 715790 It's difficult for a man of your position<br />to keep a love nest like this secret...
715790 718500 particularly where there's<br />a married woman involved.
718500 721550 - She would never...<br />- Yet here we are.
721550 723800 - With a dilemma.<br />- They're getting closer.
723800 726760 - You got what you came for.<br />COBB: Well, that's not true.
726760 729600 You left out a key piece<br />of information, didn't you?
729600 732930 You held something back because<br />you knew what we were up to.
732930 737020 - Question is, why'd you let us in at all?<br />- An audition.
737020 740110 - An audition for what?<br />- Doesn't matter. You failed.
740110 743240 We extracted every bit of<br />information you had in there.
743240 748240 But your deception was obvious.
786400 790990 - So leave me and go.<br />- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
790990 795410 That Corporation that hired<br />us, they won't accept failure.
795410 799500 We won't last two days.
799500 800830 Cobb?
800840 804170 Looks like I'm gonna have<br />to do this a little more simply.
804170 808840 Tell us what you know!<br />Tell us what you know, now!
811300 814810 SAITO: I've always<br />hated this carpet.
814810 819810 It's stained and frayed<br />in such distinctive ways.
820190 824360 But very definitely<br />made of wool.
824360 827110 Right now...
827110 832110 I'm lying on polyester.
833410 838410 Which means I'm not lying<br />on my carpet, in my apartment.
839120 842830 You have lived up to<br />your reputation, Mr. Cobb.
842840 846550 I'm still dreaming.
851550 856550 - How'd it go?<br />- Not good.
858770 863770 Dream within a<br />dream? I'm impressed.
864150 867820 But in my dream,<br />you play by my rules.
867820 870240 Yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...
870240 871820 We're not in your dream.
871820 873570 We're in mine.
883330 885590 Asshole. How do you<br />mess up the carpet?
885590 888090 - It wasn't my fault.<br />- You're the architect.
888090 890380 I didn't know he was<br />gonna rub his cheek on it!
890380 892590 That's enough.
892590 894590 You. What the hell was all that?
894600 897640 - I have it under control.<br />- I'd hate to see you out of control.
897640 901600 We don't have time for<br />this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.
901600 903600 ARTHUR: He's not gonna<br />check every compartment.
903600 905400 Yeah, well, I don't like trains.
905400 910400 Listen. Every man for himself.
982520 983730 Yes, hello?
983730 986850 PHILLIPA: <i>Hi, Daddy.</i><br />JAMES: <i>Hi, Dad.</i>
986850 990650 Hey, guys. Hey. How<br />are you? How you doing?
990650 993030 PHILLIPA: <i>Good.</i><br />JAMES: <i>Okay, I guess.</i>
993030 996950 Okay? Who's just<br />okay? Is that you, James?
996950 1001870 JAMES: <i>Yeah. When are<br />you coming home, Dad?</i>
1001870 1006660 Well, I can't, sweetheart. I<br />can't. Not for a while, remember?
1006670 1008330 JAMES: Why?
1008330 1013330 Look, I told you, I'm away<br />because I'm working, right?
1014220 1017720 PHILLIPA: <i>Grandma says<br />you're never coming back.</i>
1017720 1020550 COBB: <i>Phillipa, is that you?</i>
1020550 1023060 Put Grandma on the<br />phone for me, will you?
1023060 1026890 PHILLIPA: <i>She's<br />shaking her head.</i>
1026890 1030270 Well, just hope she's<br />wrong about that.
1030270 1032190 JAMES: <i>Daddy?</i>
1032190 1033400 Yeah, James?
1033400 1037700 JAMES: <i>Is Mommy with you?</i>
1037700 1041200 James, we talked about this.
1041200 1044580 Mommy's not here anymore.
1044580 1047580 JAMES: <i>Where?</i>
1047580 1050380 WOMAN: <i>That's enough, kids.<br />Say bye-bye.</i>
1050380 1053590 Listen, I'm gonna send some<br />presents with Grandpa, all right?
1053590 1054750 And you be good, you be...
1065100 1070100 - Our ride's on the roof.<br />- Right.
1074480 1076400 Hey, are you okay?
1076400 1077860 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
1077860 1080450 Well, down in the<br />dream, Mal showing up.
1080450 1083870 Look, I'm, sorry about your<br />leg. Won't happen again.
1083870 1085370 It's getting worse, isn't it?
1085380 1087620 One apology's all<br />you're getting, all right?
1087620 1090290 - Where's Nash?<br />- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
1090290 1092920 We were supposed to deliver<br />Saito's expansion plans...
1092920 1094840 to Cobol Engineering<br />two hours ago.
1094840 1098630 By now, they know we<br />failed. It's time we disappear.
1098630 1101300 - Where you gonna go?<br />- Buenos Aires.
1101300 1105720 I can lie low there, maybe sniff out<br />a job when things quiet down. You?
1105720 1107140 Stateside.
1107140 1112140 Send my regards.
1114980 1119980 He sold you out. Thought to<br />come to me and bargain for his life.
1120700 1125700 So I offer you the satisfaction.
1126450 1131450 It's not the way I<br />deal with things.
1141260 1144510 - What will you do with him?<br />- Nothing.
1144510 1149510 But I can't speak for<br />Cobol Engineering.
1161530 1166160 - What do you want from us?<br />- Inception.
1166160 1168700 - Is it possible?<br />- Of course not.
1168700 1171080 If you can steal an idea<br />from someone's mind...
1171080 1173120 why can't you plant<br />one there instead?
1173120 1175380 Okay, here's me planting<br />an idea in your head.
1175380 1178880 I say, "Don't think about elephants."<br />What are you thinking about?
1178880 1180050 Elephants.
1180050 1183420 Right. But it's not your idea,<br />because you know I gave it to you.
1183430 1186550 The subject's mind can always<br />trace the genesis of the idea.
1186550 1191550 - True inspiration's impossible to fake.<br />- That's not true.
1192310 1195560 - Can you do it?<br />- Are you offering me a choice?
1195560 1198400 Because I can find my own<br />way to square things with Cobol.
1198400 1200610 Then you do have a choice.
1200610 1205610 Then I choose to leave, sir.
1207280 1212280 Tell the crew where<br />you want to go.
1214250 1218500 Hey, Mr. Cobb.
1218500 1221380 How would you like to go home?
1221380 1225090 To America. To your children.
1225090 1228600 You can't fix that. No one can.
1228600 1233600 - Just like inception.<br />- Cobb, come on.
1235600 1238650 - How complex is the idea?<br />- Simple enough.
1238650 1242610 No idea is simple when you need<br />to plant it in somebody else's mind.
1242610 1246280 My main competitor is<br />an old man in poor health.
1246280 1250950 His son will soon inherit<br />control of the Corporation.
1250950 1255200 I need him to decide to<br />break up his father's empire.
1255210 1259960 - Cobb, we should walk away from this.<br />- Hold on.
1259960 1263380 If I were to do this,<br />if I even could do it...
1263380 1265470 I'd need a guarantee.
1265470 1269300 - How do I know you can deliver?<br />- You don't.
1269300 1271390 Butlcan.
1271390 1276390 So do you want to<br />take a leap of faith...
1276390 1280400 or become an old<br />man, filled with regret...
1280400 1285400 waiting to die alone?
1286070 1291070 Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.<br />And choose your people more wisely.
1298500 1303130 Look, I know how much<br />you wanna go home.
1303130 1305000 This can't be done.
1305010 1308510 Yes, it can. Just have<br />to go deep enough.
1308510 1311340 You don't know that.
1311350 1314390 I've done it before.
1314390 1319390 Who'd you do it to?
1320810 1324400 Why are we going to Paris?
1324400 1326690 We're gonna need<br />a new architect.
1343040 1346880 COBB: You never did<br />like your office, did you?
1346880 1351800 No space to think in<br />that broom cupboard.
1351800 1355260 Is it safe for you to be here?
1355260 1357850 Extradition between France<br />and the United States...
1357850 1360230 is a bureaucratic<br />nightmare, you know that.
1360230 1363150 I think they might find a way<br />to make it work in your case.
1363150 1367820 Look, I, brought these for you to give<br />to the kids when you have a chance.
1367820 1370570 It'll take more than the<br />occasional stuffed animal...
1370570 1373740 to convince those children<br />they still have a father.
1373740 1376740 I'm just doing what I know.<br />I'm doing what you taught me.
1376740 1378410 I never taught<br />you to be a thief.
1378410 1380790 No, you taught me to<br />navigate people's minds.
1380790 1382250 But after what happened...
1382250 1387250 there weren't a whole lot of<br />legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
1390970 1394590 What are you doing here, Dom?
1394600 1397140 I think I found a way home.
1397140 1400930 It's a job for some very,<br />very powerful people.
1400930 1405930 People who I believe can<br />fix my charges permanently.
1406150 1408110 But I need your help.
1408110 1411610 You're here to corrupt one<br />of my brightest and best.
1411610 1414660 You know what I'm offering.<br />Let them decide for themselves.
1414660 1416280 - Money.<br />- Not just money.
1416280 1417780 You remember.
1417790 1421200 It's the chance to build<br />cathedrals, entire cities...
1421210 1423120 things that never existed...
1423120 1426500 things that couldn't<br />exist in the real world.
1426500 1431500 So you want me to let someone<br />else follow you into your fantasy?
1431840 1433970 They don't actually<br />come into the dream.
1433970 1437430 They just design the levels and<br />teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
1437430 1441310 Design it yourself.
1441310 1446310 Mal won't let me.
1449020 1452490 Come back to reality, Dom.
1452490 1455450 - Please.<br />- Reality.
1455450 1458160 Those kids, your<br />grandchildren...
1458160 1462330 they're waiting for their father to<br />come back home. That's their reality.
1462330 1466040 And this job, this last<br />job, that's how I get there.
1466040 1471040 I would not be standing<br />here if I knew any other way.
1472840 1477840 I need an architect<br />who's as good as I was.
1479970 1482140 I've got somebody better.
1482140 1485770 <i>Ariadne?</i>
1485770 1488690 I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
1488690 1489980 Pleased to meet you.
1489980 1494820 If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has<br />a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
1494820 1496240 A work placement?
1496240 1497700 Not exactly.
1497700 1499780 I have a test for you.
1499780 1502030 You're not gonna<br />tell me anything first?
1502040 1504830 Before I describe the job, I<br />have to know you can do it.
1504830 1509830 - Why?<br />- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
1511130 1516130 You have two minutes to design a<br />maze that it takes one minute to solve.
1517720 1521300 Stop.
1521310 1524640 Again.
1524640 1525640 Stop.
1529150 1534150 You're gonna have<br />to do better than that.
1544240 1549240 That's more like it.
1565680 1568770 COBB: <i>They say we only use a<br />fraction of our brain's true potential.</i>
1568770 1570600 <i>Now, that's when we're awake.</i>
1570600 1573770 When we're asleep, our<br />mind can do almost anything.
1573770 1574940 Such as?
1574940 1579110 Imagine you're designing a building.<br />You consciously create each aspect.
1579110 1583120 But sometimes, it feels like it's almost<br />creating itself, if you know what I mean.
1583120 1585280 Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
1585290 1587700 Genuine inspiration, right?
1587700 1591210 Now, in a dream, our<br />mind continuously does this.
1591210 1596000 We create and perceive<br />our world simultaneously.
1596000 1599590 And our mind does this so well that<br />we don't even know it's happening.
1599590 1602470 That allows us to get right<br />in the middle of that process.
1602470 1605010 - How?<br />- By taking over the creating part.
1605010 1606810 Now, this is where I need you.
1606810 1609350 You create the<br />world of the dream.
1609350 1614350 We bring the subject into that dream,<br />and they fill it with their subconscious.
1614900 1619740 How could I ever acquire enough detail<br />to make them think that it's reality?
1619740 1623360 Well, dreams, they feel real<br />while we're in them, right?
1623370 1628370 It's only when we wake up that we<br />realize something was actually strange.
1628540 1630120 Let me ask you a question.
1630120 1633670 You never really remember the<br />beginning of a dream, do you?
1633670 1636880 You always wind up right in<br />the middle of what's going on.
1636880 1638090 I guess, yeah.
1638090 1640050 So how did we end up here?
1640050 1642340 Well, we just came from the...
1642340 1646350 Think about it, Ariadne.<br />How did you get here?
1646350 1651350 Where are you right now?
1651560 1652890 We're dreaming?
1652890 1655520 You're in the middle of<br />the workshop, sleeping.
1655520 1658650 This is your first lesson in<br />shared dreaming. Stay calm.
1695810 1698110 If it's just a dream,<br />then why are you...?
1699570 1701480 COBB: Because it's<br />neverjust a dream, is it?
1701490 1704950 And a face full of glass hurts like<br />hell. When you're in it, it feels real.
1704950 1707320 ARTHUR: That's why the<br />military developed dream sharing.
1707320 1711200 It was a training program for Soldiers<br />to shoot, stab and strangle each other...
1711200 1712620 and then wake up.
1712620 1714580 ARIADNE: How did<br />architects become involved?
1714580 1718460 COBB: Well, someone had<br />to design the dreams, right?
1718460 1721800 Why don't you give us<br />another five minutes?
1721800 1725930 Five minutes? What...? We were<br />talking for, like, at least an hour.
1725930 1728340 In a dream, your mind<br />functions more quickly...
1728350 1731350 therefore time seems<br />to feel more slow.
1731350 1735430 Five minutes in the real world<br />gives you an hour in the dream.
1735440 1740440 Why don't you see what you<br />can get up to in five minutes?
1744440 1747530 COBB: You've got the<br />basic layout. Bookstore, café.
1747530 1749370 Almost everything<br />else is here too.
1749370 1752450 ARIADNE: Who are the people?<br />- Projections of my subconscious.
1752450 1753790 - Yours?<br />- Yes.
1753790 1756500 Remember, you are the<br />dreamer. You build this world.
1756500 1759330 I am the subject.<br />My mind populates it.
1759330 1761420 You can literally talk<br />to my subconscious.
1761420 1764460 That's one of the ways we<br />extract information from the subject.
1764460 1765970 How else do you do it?
1765970 1770090 By creating something<br />secure, like a bank vault or a jail.
1770100 1773970 The mind automatically fills it<br />with information it's trying to protect.
1773970 1776930 - You understand?<br />- Then you break in and steal it?
1776940 1778140 Well...
1778150 1782820 I guess I thought that the dream<br />space would be all about the visual...
1782820 1785150 but it's more<br />about the feel of it.
1785150 1790150 My question is what happens when you<br />start messing with the physics of it all?
1830610 1833280 It's something, isn't it?
1833280 1838280 Yes, it is.
1858480 1860230 ARIADNE: Why are<br />they all looking at me?
1860230 1863900 Because my subconscious feels<br />that someone else is creating this world.
1863900 1868360 The more you change things, the quicker<br />the projections start to converge on you.
1868360 1869570 Converge?
1869570 1871820 They sense the foreign<br />nature of the dreamer.
1871820 1874660 They attack, like white blood<br />cells fighting an infection.
1874660 1878080 - What, they're gonna attack us?<br />- No, no.
1878080 1880870 Justyou.
1883540 1888540 This is great, but I'm telling you, if<br />you keep changing things like this...
1891300 1894430 Jeez, mind telling your<br />subconscious to take it easy?
1894430 1899430 It's my subconscious.<br />Remember? I can't control it.
1950780 1955780 Very impressive.
1963870 1967580 I know this bridge.<br />This place is real, isn't it?
1967580 1970090 Yeah, I cross it every<br />day to get to the college.
1970090 1973670 Never re-create places from your<br />memory. Always imagine new places.
1973670 1975670 You draw from<br />stuff you know, right?
1975680 1980050 Only use details. A streetlamp or<br />a phone booth. Never entire areas.
1980060 1982350 - Why not?<br />- Building a dream from your memory...
1982350 1986020 is the easiest way to lose your grasp<br />on what's real and what is a dream.
1986020 1988270 - Is that what happened to you?<br />- Listen to me.
1988270 1990440 This has nothing to do<br />with me, understand?
1990440 1992570 That why you need me<br />to build your dreams?
1992570 1995280 Hey, get off of her.<br />Back up. Back up.
1995280 1997070 - Cobb! Cobb!<br />- Get off of her!
1997070 1999530 - Let me go! Let me go!<br />- Mal!
1999530 2001780 - Mal!<br />- Cobb! Wake me up!
2001790 2003740 - Wake me up! Wake me up!<br />- No!
2003750 2005410 - Mal, no! No!<br />- Wake me up!
2006870 2011040 Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.<br />You're okay. You're okay.
2011040 2014550 - Hey.<br />- Why wouldn't I wake up?
2014550 2016340 There was still<br />time on the clock.
2016340 2019050 You can't wake up from<br />within the dream unless you die.
2019050 2020800 - She'll need a totem.<br />ARIADNE: What?
2020800 2022430 A totem, it's a<br />small personal...
2022430 2025140 That's some subconscious<br />you've got on you, Cobb!
2025140 2027140 She's a real charmer.
2027140 2029940 - I see you met Mrs. Cobb.<br />- She's his wife?
2029940 2033860 Yeah. So a totem. You need a<br />small object, potentially heavy.
2033860 2036490 Something you can have on<br />you that no one else knows.
2036490 2037900 ARIADNE: Like a coin?<br />ARTHUR: No.
2037900 2042900 It needs to be more unique<br />than that. Like, this is a loaded die.
2043660 2046750 No, I can't let you touch it.<br />That would defeat the purpose.
2046750 2051080 See, only I know the balance and<br />the weight of this particular loaded die.
2051080 2053090 That way, when you<br />look at your totem...
2053090 2058090 you know beyond a doubt that<br />you're not in someone else's dream.
2059630 2064100 I don't know if you can't see what's<br />going on, or if you just don't want to...
2064100 2067810 but Cobb has some serious problems<br />that he's tried to bury down there.
2067810 2072810 And I'm not about to just open<br />my mind to someone like that.
2077900 2081780 She'll be back. I've never seen<br />anyone pick it up that quickly before.
2081780 2086620 Reality's not gonna be enough for<br />her now, and when she comes back...
2086620 2089460 When she comes back, you're<br />gonna have her building mazes.
2089460 2091920 - Where are you gonna be?<br />- I gotta go visit Eames.
2091920 2095250 Eames? No, he's in<br />Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard.
2095250 2097210 It's a necessary risk.
2097210 2101590 - Well, there's plenty of good thieves.<br />- We don't just need a thief.
2101590 2106590 We need a forger.
2111310 2114480 Rub them together all you<br />want, they're not gonna breed.
2114480 2116440 You never know.
2116440 2120650 COBB: I'm gonna get you a drink.
2120650 2125650 You're buying.
2128500 2130950 - Your spelling hasn't improved.<br />- Piss off.
2130960 2133080 How's your handwriting?
2133080 2135080 - It's versatile.<br />- Good.
2135080 2137000 Thank you very much.
2137000 2138590 Incepüon.
2138590 2141590 Now, before you bother telling<br />me it's impossible, let me...
2141590 2145050 No, it's perfectly possible.<br />It's just bloody difficult.
2145050 2148760 Interesting. Because Arthur<br />keeps telling me it can't be done.
2148770 2151890 Arthur. You still working<br />with that stick in the mud?
2151890 2153770 He is good at<br />what he does, right?
2153770 2156020 He's the best, but he<br />has no imagination.
2156020 2157190 Not like you.
2157190 2160360 Listen, if you're gonna perform<br />inoeption, you need imagination.
2160360 2164070 Let me ask you something.<br />Have you done it before?
2164070 2167870 We tried it. We got the idea<br />in place, but it didn't take.
2167870 2171370 - You didn't plant it deep enough?<br />- No, it's not just about depth.
2171370 2173540 You need the simplest<br />version of the idea...
2173540 2177380 in order for it to grow naturally in<br />your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
2177380 2180090 So, what is this idea<br />that you need to plant?
2180090 2184470 We need the heir of a major Corporation<br />to dissolve his father's empire.
2184470 2187050 Right there you have<br />various political motivations...
2187050 2189220 and anti-monopolistic<br />sentiments and so forth.
2189220 2191220 But all of that<br />stuff, it's, om...
2191220 2194270 It's really at the mercy of your<br />subject's prejudice, you see?
2194270 2196940 What you have to do is<br />start at the absolute basic.
2196940 2199020 Which is what?
2199020 2203110 The relationship<br />with the father.
2203110 2204950 - Do you have a chemist?<br />- No, not yet.
2204950 2208200 Right. Okay, well,<br />there's a man here, Yusuf.
2208200 2211790 He, formulates his own<br />versions of the compounds.
2211790 2213250 Why don't you take me there?
2213250 2216500 Once you've lost your<br />tail. The man at the bar.
2216500 2218130 COBB: Cobol Engineering.
2218130 2220630 That price on my head,<br />was that dead or alive?
2220630 2223340 Don't remember. Let's<br />see if he starts shooting.
2223340 2227130 Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs<br />in the bar in, say, half an hour?
2227140 2229300 - Back here?<br />- This is the last place they'd suspect.
2231680 2234180 All right.
2234180 2236180 Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
2236190 2239150 My God, it's you, isn't it?
2241190 2242440 No, it isn't you.
2242440 2244030 Not dreaming now, are you?
2246070 2251070 MAN: Get him!
2263170 2264170 There!
2284820 2285820 <i>One café.</i>
2290910 2293870 Shh.
2297710 2302830 <i>One café.</i>
2356260 2359350 Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
2359350 2364100 - What are you doing in Mombasa?<br />- I'm here to protect my investment.
2365940 2369070 So this is your<br />idea of losing a tail?
2369070 2372900 Different tail.
2378790 2381660 Cobb said you'd be back.
2381660 2385380 - I tried not to come, but...<br />- But there's nothing quite like it.
2385380 2388550 It's just...
2388550 2390050 pure creation.
2390050 2392720 Shall we take a look at some<br />paradoxical architecture?
2392720 2394890 ARTHUR: You're gonna<br />have to master a few tricks...
2394890 2398600 if you're gonna build three<br />complete dream levels. Excuse me.
2398600 2400180 ARIADNE: What kind of tricks?
2400180 2403850 In a dream, you can cheat<br />architecture into impossible shapes.
2403850 2407940 That lets you create closed<br />loops, like the Penrose Steps.
2407940 2412940 The infinite staircase.
2413320 2414320 See?
2418950 2420160 Paradox.
2420160 2421750 So a closed loop like that...
2421750 2425000 will help you disguise the<br />boundaries of the dream you create.
2425000 2427130 But how big do these<br />levels have to be?
2427130 2430460 It could be anything from the<br />floor of a building to an entire city.
2430460 2434050 They have to be complicated enough<br />that we can hide from the projections.
2434050 2435630 - A maze?<br />- Right, a maze.
2435640 2437140 And the better the maze...
2437140 2439970 Then the longer we have<br />before the projections Catch us?
2439970 2441930 Exactly.
2441930 2446930 - My subconscious seems polite enough.<br />- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.
2447230 2448810 No one likes to feel someone<br />else messing around in their mind.
2448810 2452730 Cobb can't build<br />anymore, can he?
2452740 2454740 I don't know if he<br />can't, but he won't.
2454740 2457320 He thinks it's Safer if he<br />doesn't know the layouts.
2457320 2458570 Why?
2458570 2461240 He won't tell me.<br />But I think it's Mal.
2461240 2463700 - His ex-wife?<br />- No, not his ex.
2463700 2468120 - They're still together?<br />- No.
2468130 2471590 No, she's dead.
2471590 2476590 What you see in there is<br />just his projection of her.
2477840 2480010 What was she like in real life?
2480010 2485010 She was lovely.
2485230 2487770 YUSUF: <i>You are seeking a chemist?</i><br />COBB: <i>Yes.</i>
2487770 2490560 To formulate<br />compounds for a job?
2490570 2492610 And to go into<br />the field with us.
2492610 2495030 No, I rarely go into<br />the field, Mr. Cobb.
2495030 2498910 Well, we'd need you there to tailor<br />compounds specific to our needs.
2498910 2501200 - Which are?<br />- Great depth.
2501200 2506200 A dream within a<br />dream? Two levels?
2507210 2508420 Three.
2508420 2512170 Not possible. That many dreams<br />within dreams is too unstable.
2512170 2516300 It is possible. You just<br />have to add a sedative.
2516300 2520760 A powerful sedative.
2520760 2523180 - How many team members?<br />- Five.
2523180 2525770 SAITO: Six.
2525770 2529980 The only way to know you've<br />done the job is if I go in with you.
2529980 2533230 There's no room for tourists<br />on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
2533230 2536570 This time, it seems there is.
2536570 2540450 This, I think, is a good place<br />to start. I use it every day.
2540450 2545450 COBB: What for?<br />- Here, I'll show you.
2546910 2551580 Perhaps you will<br />not want to see.
2551580 2553380 After you.
2562470 2565640 EAMES: Ten. Twelve.<br />All connected. Bloody hell.
2565640 2570440 They come every day<br />to share the dream.
2570440 2575440 You see? Very stable.
2578740 2583070 - How long do they dream for?<br />YUSUF: Three, four hours, each day.
2583070 2584280 In dream time?
2584280 2588120 With this compound? About<br />40 hours, each and every day.
2588120 2592960 - Why do they do it?<br />YUSUF: Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
2592960 2595540 After a while, it becomes<br />the only way you can dream.
2595540 2598130 Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
2598130 2603130 - They come here every day to sleep?<br />MAN: No.
2603260 2606970 They come to be woken up.
2606970 2611180 The dream has<br />become their reality.
2611190 2615860 Who are you to<br />say otherwise, sir?
2615860 2620860 Let's see what you can do.
2628490 2632660 You know how to find me.
2632670 2637670 You know what you have to do.
2639920 2644920 Sharp, no?
2656560 2659940 SAITO: Are you<br />all right, Mr. Cobb?
2659940 2664940 Yeah, yeah.<br />Everything's just fine.
2672160 2676040 Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer<br />Morrow energy conglomerate.
2676040 2678080 COBB: What's your<br />problem with this Mr. Fischer?
2678090 2680090 That's not your concern.
2680090 2684630 Mr. Saito, this isn't your<br />typical corporate espionage.
2684630 2686380 You asked me for inception.
2686390 2689930 I do hope you understand<br />the gravity of that request.
2689930 2694060 Now, the seed that we plant in this<br />man's mind will grow into an idea.
2694060 2696100 This idea will define him.
2696100 2698100 It may come to change...
2698110 2700570 Well, it may come to<br />change everything about him.
2700570 2705070 We're the last company standing<br />between them and total energy dominance.
2705070 2707320 And we can no longer compete.
2707320 2710950 Soon, they'll control the<br />energy supply of half the world.
2710950 2714750 In effect, they become<br />a new superpower.
2714750 2718250 The world needs Robert<br />Fischer to change his mind.
2718250 2719960 EAMES: That's where we come in.
2719960 2723420 How is Robert Fischer's<br />relationship with his father?
2723420 2726300 Rumor is the relationship<br />is quite complicated.
2726300 2728970 Well, we can't work based<br />solely on rumor, can we?
2728970 2732350 Can you get me access<br />to this man here? Browning.
2732350 2736680 Fischer Senior's right-hand<br />man. Fischer Junior's godfather.
2736690 2740100 It should be possible, if you<br />can get the right references.
2740110 2745110 References are something of<br />a Specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
2745240 2748320 BROWNING: I'm not smelling<br />settlement here. Take them down.
2748320 2749610 LAWYER: Mr. Browning...
2749620 2754620 Maurice Fischer's policy is<br />always one of avoiding litigation.
2756000 2760630 Well, shall we voice your<br />concerns with Maurice directly?
2760630 2762210 Not sure that's necessary.
2762210 2767210 No, no, no. I think we should.
2786150 2788570 BROWNING: How is he?
2788570 2791490 I don't want to bother<br />him unnecessarily, but...
2791490 2796490 MAURICE: Robert, I told you keep<br />out the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...
2797250 2800710 NURSE: Mr. Fischer.<br />MAURICE: Put it through.
2800710 2805630 Never, never. Never<br />do the same as I asked.
2805630 2810630 Leave that.
2811010 2814640 Here.
2814640 2818140 BROWNING: Must be a<br />cherished memory of his.
2818140 2822850 I put it beside his bed.<br />He hasn't even noticed.
2822860 2826860 Robert...
2826860 2829440 we need to talk about<br />a power of attorney.
2829450 2832740 I know this is hard,<br />but it's imperative...
2832750 2834450 Not now, Uncle Peter.
2836740 2838700 EAMES: <i>The vultures are circling.</i>
2838700 2843290 <i>And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,<br />the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</i>
2843290 2846340 I've had ample opportunity<br />to observe Browning...
2846340 2850880 <i>and adopt his physical presence, study<br />his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.</i>
2850880 2854890 So now in the first layer of the<br />dream, I can impersonate Browning.
2854890 2858310 <i>And suggest concepts to<br />Fischer's conscious mind.</i>
2858310 2860310 Then, when we take<br />him a level deeper...
2860310 2863980 his own projection of Browning<br />should feed that right back to him.
2863980 2866060 So he gives himself the idea.
2866070 2868710 Precisely. That's the<br />only way it will stick.
2868720 2870490 It has to seem self-generated.
2870490 2874070 Eames, I am impressed.
2874070 2879070 Your condescension, as always, is<br />much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
2898970 2901140 Were you going<br />under on your own?
2901140 2904810 No, no, I was just,<br />running some experiments.
2904810 2906940 I didn't realize<br />anyone was here, 30...
2906940 2909770 Yeah, I was just... I was<br />working on my totem, actually.
2909780 2913110 Here, let me take a look.
2913110 2914610 So you're learning?
2914610 2918740 An elegant solution for<br />keeping track of reality.
2918740 2921370 - Was it your idea?<br />- No, it was...
2921370 2924120 It was Mal's, actually. This...
2924120 2928130 This one was hers. She would spin it<br />in the dream and it would never topple.
2928130 2932550 Just spin and spin.
2932550 2936380 Arthur told me she passed away.
2936390 2938640 How are the mazes coming along?
2938640 2941680 Each level relates to the part<br />of the subject's subconscious...
2941680 2943310 that we are trying to access.
2943310 2948310 So I'm making the bottom level a<br />hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.
2949150 2952070 You know, I... Actually, I have<br />a question about this layout.
2952070 2956990 No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.<br />Only the dreamer should know the layout.
2956990 2958320 Why is that so important?
2958320 2960490 In case one of us<br />brings in our projections.
2960490 2964200 We don't want them knowing<br />the details of the maze.
2964200 2966830 You mean in case<br />you bring Mal in.
2966830 2970170 You can't keep her out, can you?
2970170 2971840 - Right.<br />- You can't build...
2971840 2975340 because if you know the<br />maze, then she knows it.
2975340 2977680 Well, she'd sabotage<br />the whole operation.
2977680 2980680 - Cobb, do the others know?<br />- No. No, they don't.
2980680 2983060 You've gotta warn them<br />if this is getting worse.
2983060 2986180 No one said it's getting worse.
2986190 2990350 I need to get home. That's<br />all I care about right now.
2990360 2995360 Why can't you go home?
2995530 3000530 Because they think I killed her.
3000820 3003280 - Thank you.<br />- For what?
3003290 3005700 For not asking whether I did.
3005700 3008040 "I will split up my<br />father's empire."
3008040 3012420 Now, this is obviously an idea that<br />Robert himself would choose to reject...
3012420 3015380 which is why we need to plant<br />it deep in his subconscious.
3015380 3019090 The subconscious is motivated<br />by emotion, right? Not reason.
3019090 3023050 We need to find a way to translate<br />this into an emotional concept.
3023060 3025640 How do you translate<br />business strategy into emotion?
3025640 3029390 That's what we're here to figure out.<br />Robert's relationship with his father...
3029390 3032310 - ...is stressed, to say the least.<br />- Can we run with that?
3032310 3036070 We suggest breaking up his father's<br />company as a "screw you" to the old man.
3036070 3039950 No, because I think positive emotion<br />trumps negative emotion every time.
3039950 3043830 We all yearn for<br />reconciliation, for catharsis.
3043830 3047750 We need Robert Fischer to have a<br />positive emotional reaction to all this.
3047750 3049750 All right, well, try this. Um...
3049750 3054750 "My father accepts that I want to create<br />for myself, not follow in his footsteps."
3054920 3056130 That might work.
3056130 3059470 Might? We're gonna need to<br />do a little better than "might."
3059470 3061590 Thank you for your<br />contribution, Arthur.
3061590 3064760 Forgive me for wanting<br />a little specificity, Eames.
3064760 3066010 Specificity?
3066010 3068020 Inception's not<br />about being specific.
3068020 3073020 When we get inside his mind, we're<br />gonna have to work with what we find.
3073270 3076440 EAMES: On the top level, we open<br />up his relationship with his father...
3076440 3079690 and say, "I will not follow<br />in my father's footsteps."
3079700 3084530 Then the next level down, we feed<br />him, "I will create something for myself."
3084530 3088040 Then, by the time we hit the bottom<br />level, we bring out the big guns.
3088040 3090620 - "My father doesn't want me to be him."<br />EAMES: Exactly.
3091790 3095960 Three layers down, the dreams are gonna<br />Collapse with the slightest disturbance.
3095960 3097300 Sedation.
3097300 3100300 For sleep stable enough to<br />create three layers of dreaming...
3100300 3104550 we'll have to combine it with<br />an extremely powerful sedative.
3115650 3117320 Good night.
3117320 3119690 YUSUF: <i>The compound we'll<br />be using to share the dream...</i>
3119690 3121820 <i>Creates</i> a <i>clear connection<br />between dreamers...</i>
3121820 3126200 - ...whilst accelerating brain function.<br />- In other words, more time on each level.
3126200 3129540 Brain function in the dream<br />will be about 20 times normal.
3129540 3133210 And when you enter a dream within<br />that dream, the effect is compounded.
3133210 3135500 It's three dreams, that's<br />10 hours times 20...
3135500 3138540 Math was never my strong<br />subject. How much time is that?
3138550 3141920 It's a week, the<br />first level down.
3141920 3144930 Six months the second level<br />down, and the third level...
3144930 3149010 That's 10 years.
3149010 3151560 Who'd wanna be stuck<br />in a dream for 10 years?
3151560 3152890 Depends on the dream.
3152890 3155350 So once we've made the<br />plant, how do we get out?
3155350 3158860 I'm hoping you have something more<br />elegant than shooting me in the head.
3158860 3161820 - A kick.<br />- What's a kick?
3161820 3166660 EAMES: This,<br />Ariadne, would be a kick.
3166660 3169530 It's that feeling of falling<br />you get that jolts you awake.
3169530 3172910 - Snaps you out of the dream.<br />- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
3172910 3174290 YUSUP That's the clever part.
3174290 3177710 I customized the sedative to<br />leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
3177710 3182710 That way, however deep the<br />sleep, the Sleeper still feels falling.
3182710 3185720 <i>Or tipping.</i>
3185720 3190390 The trick is to synchronize a kick<br />that can penetrate all three levels.
3190390 3194100 We could use a musical Countdown<br />to synchronize the different kicks.
3201820 3205490 EAMES: <i>He hasn't got any surgery<br />scheduled, no dental, nothing.</i>
3205490 3207660 COBB: <i>Wasn't he supposed<br />to have a knee operation?</i>
3207660 3211080 Nothing. Nothing that they'll put<br />him under for, anyway. And we need...
3211080 3213160 We need at least<br />a good 10 hours.
3213160 3215830 Sydney to Los Angeles.
3215830 3220250 One of the longest flights in the<br />world. He makes it every two weeks.
3220250 3222920 He must be flying private, then.
3222920 3226260 SAITO: Not if there were unexpected<br />maintenance with his plane.
3226260 3228680 ARTHUR: It would have to be a 747.<br />- Why's that?
3228680 3230300 On a 747, the pilot's up top...
3230300 3233680 the first-class cabin's in the nose,<br />so no one would walk through.
3233680 3237350 You'd have to buy out the entire<br />Cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
3237350 3240480 I bought the airline.
3240480 3243900 It seemed neater.
3243900 3247360 Well, looks like we<br />have our 10 hours.
3247360 3252360 Ariadne? Terrific<br />work, by the way.
3298500 3302170 MAL: You know how to find me.
3302170 3307170 You know what you have to do.
3307420 3311760 You remember when you<br />asked me to marry you?
3311760 3314890 Of course I do.
3314890 3319890 You said you had a dream.
3320350 3324520 That we'd grow old together.
3324520 3329520 And we can.
3332910 3337910 COBB: You shouldn't be here.
3338620 3342250 Just wanted to see what kind of tests<br />you're doing on your own every night.
3342250 3345630 - This has nothing to do with you.<br />- This has everything to do with me.
3345630 3350630 - You've asked me to share dreams with you.<br />- Not these. These are my dreams.
3362310 3364900 ARIADNE: Why do<br />you do this to yourself?
3364900 3369570 It's the only way<br />I can still dream.
3369570 3372700 Why is it so important to dream?
3372700 3377700 In my dreams,<br />we're still together.
3389300 3392840 These aren't just dreams.
3392840 3396050 These are memories. And<br />you said never to use memories.
3396050 3397760 I know I did.
3397760 3402430 You're trying to keep her<br />alive. You can't let her go.
3402430 3405600 You don't understand.<br />These are moments I regret.
3405600 3409440 They're memories<br />that I have to change.
3409440 3412280 Well, what's down<br />there that you regret?
3412280 3417280 Listen, there's only one thing<br />you need to understand about me.
3423910 3426170 ARIADNE: This is your house?
3426170 3428790 Mine and Mal's, yes.
3428790 3431170 Where is she?
3431170 3436170 She's already gone.
3437930 3439640 That's my son, James.
3439640 3442890 He's digging for<br />something, maybe a worm.
3444100 3445770 That's Phillipa.
3445770 3447810 I thought about<br />calling out to them...
3447810 3451270 so they'd turn and<br />smile and I could see...
3451270 3456270 those beautiful faces of<br />theirs, but it's all too late.
3456570 3461570 MAN: Right now or never, Cobb.
3463870 3465830 COBB: Then I start to panic.
3465830 3469380 I realize I'm gonna<br />regret this moment...
3469380 3471880 that I need to see<br />their faces one last time.
3471880 3474550 WOMAN: James!<br />Phillipa! Come on in!
3474550 3478800 COBB: But the moment's past.
3478800 3483060 And whatever I do, I<br />can't change this moment.
3483060 3486270 As I'm about to<br />call out to them...
3486270 3490100 they run away.
3490110 3494400 If I'm ever gonna see their faces<br />again, I've gotta get back home.
3494400 3499400 The real world.
3537490 3539780 What are you doing here?
3539780 3541070 My name is...
3541070 3546070 I know who you are.<br />What are you doing here?
3552540 3555130 I'm just trying to understand.
3555130 3558460 How could you understand?
3558470 3562590 Do you know what<br />it is to be a lover?
3562590 3565970 To be half of a whole?
3565970 3569020 No.
3569020 3572480 I'll tell you a riddle.
3572480 3575810 You're waiting for a train.
3575820 3580360 A train that will<br />take you far away.
3580360 3584370 You know where you<br />hope this train will take you...
3584370 3586780 but you don't know for sure.
3586790 3589660 But it doesn't matter.
3589660 3593250 How can it not matter to you<br />where that train will take you?
3593250 3596040 COBB: Because<br />you'll be together.
3596040 3599550 MAL: How could you bring her here, Dom?<br />- What is this place?
3599550 3602880 This is a hotel suite where we<br />used to spend our anniversary.
3602880 3606140 What happened here?
3606140 3609390 You promised! You<br />promised we'd be together!
3609390 3611640 Please, I need you to<br />stay here just for now!
3611640 3615020 You said we'd be together!<br />You said we'd grow old together!
3615020 3617650 I'll come back<br />for you. I promise.
3635710 3640710 Do you think you can just build a<br />prison of memories to lock her in?
3641720 3645010 Do you really think that<br />that's gonna contain her?
3645010 3647510 SAITO: It's time.
3647510 3650010 Maurice Fischerjust<br />died in Sydney.
3650010 3652350 - When's the funeral?<br />- Thursday. In Los Angeles.
3652350 3655770 Robert should accompany the body<br />no later than Tuesday. We should move.
3655770 3657860 All right.
3657860 3661020 - Cobb, I'm coming with you.<br />- I promised Miles. No.
3661030 3666030 The team needs someone who<br />understands what you're struggling with.
3666740 3669070 And it doesn't have to be me...
3669080 3674080 but then you have to<br />show Arthur what I just saw.
3678170 3683170 Get us another<br />seat on the plane.
3683920 3687130 COBB: If I get on this plane and<br />you don't honor our agreement...
3687140 3691470 when we land, I go to<br />jail for the rest of my life.
3691470 3693850 Complete the job en route...
3693850 3696480 I make one phone<br />call from the plane...
3696480 3701480 you have no trouble<br />getting through Immigration.
3713120 3715790 - I'm sorry.<br />- Yeah, absolutely.
3715790 3720790 Thank you.
3750950 3754450 Excuse me, I think this is<br />yours? You must have dropped it.
3754450 3756500 FLIGHT ATTENDANT:<br />Would you care for a drink?
3756500 3757960 Water, please.
3757960 3761250 Om, same, please.
3761250 3763290 Um...
3763290 3764550 Thank you.
3764550 3766590 You know, I couldn't<br />help but notice...
3766590 3770340 but you wouldn't happen to be related<br />to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
3770340 3772800 Yes, he, om...
3772800 3775220 He was my father.
3775220 3780220 Well, he was a very inspiring<br />figure. I'm sorry for your loss.
3782230 3784060 - Here you go.<br />- Thank you.
3784070 3785820 COBB: Hey.
3785820 3788030 To your father.
3788030 3793030 May he rest in peace?
3858720 3861220 - Couldn't have peed before you went under?<br />- Sorry.
3861230 3863440 Bit too much free<br />champagne before takeoff?
3863440 3864730 Ha, ha, bloody ha.
3864730 3869730 We know he's gonna be<br />looking for a taxi in this weather.
3879370 3884370 - Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...?<br />- Walk away.
3899260 3900850 Just have him ca... I gotta go.
3900850 3905850 All right. Taxi. Thank you.
3905940 3909360 All right, Third and<br />Market. Snappy.
3909360 3911860 - What are you doing?<br />- Sorry, I thought it was free.
3911860 3913530 - It's not.<br />- Maybe we could share.
3913530 3918530 Maybe not. Can you<br />pull over and get this...?
3919330 3920330 Great.
3925620 3926620 Come on.
3938180 3940970 There's $500 in there. The<br />wallet's worth more than that.
3940970 3942850 You might at least<br />drop me at my stop.
3942850 3944140 I'm afraid that it doesn't...
3953650 3955650 - Cover him!<br />EAMES: Down! Down now!
3955650 3960650 What the hell is going on?
3960990 3964160 ARIADNE: This<br />wasn't in the design.
3964160 3966290 Cobb?
4017720 4018720 Get him!
4025600 4027220 Are you all right?
4027230 4029560 Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
4029560 4031650 Fischer's okay,<br />unless he gets carsick.
4031650 4032650 Saüo?
4051790 4054250 COBB: Get Fischer<br />in the back room now.
4054250 4057380 - Get him in the back room. Move.<br />ARTHUR: What the hell happened?
4057380 4059010 COBB: Has he been<br />shot? Is he dying?
4059010 4060920 ARTHUR: I don't know.<br />- Jesus Christ.
4060930 4063510 ARTHUR: What happened to you?<br />- Blocked by a freight train.
4063510 4065640 Why put a train in a<br />downtown intersection?
4065640 4067430 - I didn't.<br />ARTHUR: Where'd it come from?
4067430 4069270 Why the hell were we ambushed?
4069270 4073770 Those were not normal projections.<br />They'd been trained, for God's sakes.
4073770 4075560 - How could he be trained?<br />- Fischer's had an extractor...
4075570 4079940 teach his subconscious to defend<br />itself, so his subconscious is militarized.
4079940 4081740 It should've shown<br />in the research.
4081740 4083700 COBB: Why the hell didn't it?<br />- Calm down.
4083700 4085200 COBB: Don't tell<br />me to calm down!
4085200 4088290 This was your job, goddamn<br />it! This was your responsibility!
4088290 4090540 You were meant to check<br />Fischer's background!
4090540 4094040 - We are not prepared for this!<br />- We have dealt with sub-security before!
4094040 4096290 We'll be more careful<br />and we're gonna be fine!
4096290 4098300 This was not a part<br />of the plan! He's dying.
4098300 4099500 Put him out his misety.
4099510 4102510 - No, don't do that! Don't do that.<br />- Cobb, hey, hey.
4102510 4104800 He's in agony.<br />I'm waking him up.
4104800 4106850 No. It won't wake him up.
4106850 4110640 What do you mean, it won't wake him<br />up? When we die in a dream, we wake up.
4110640 4112060 Not from this.
4112060 4115190 We're too heavily sedated<br />to wake up that way.
4115190 4117060 Right. So, what<br />happens when we die?
4117060 4119070 - We drop into limbo.<br />- Are you serious?
4119070 4121780 - Limbo?<br />ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space.
4121780 4125200 ARIADNE: What the hell is down there?<br />- Just raw, infinite subconscious.
4125200 4128580 Nothing is down there, except for<br />what might have been left behind...
4128580 4131660 by anyone sharing the dream<br />who's been trapped there before.
4131660 4133710 Which, in our case, is just you.
4133710 4136580 - How long could we be stuck?<br />YUSUF: Can't even think about...
4136580 4139170 - ...trying to escape until the sedation...<br />- How long?
4139170 4142550 Decades. It could be infinite. Ask<br />him, he's the one who's been there.
4142550 4143920 ARTHUR: Let's get him upstairs.
4145380 4147840 Great.
4147850 4150010 Thank you.
4150010 4153430 So now we're trapped in Fischer's<br />mind, battling his own private army.
4153430 4155060 And if we get killed...
4155060 4160060 we'll be lost in limbo till our<br />brains turn to scrambled egg?
4165200 4169280 ARTHUR: Someone got first aid?
4169280 4172910 - You knew these risks and didn't tell us?<br />- There weren't meant to be risks.
4172910 4175100 I didn't know we'd be<br />dealing with gunfire.
4175110 4176040 You had no right.
4176040 4178540 This was the only way<br />to go three layers deep.
4178540 4180710 You knew about this<br />and went along with it?
4180710 4181920 I trusted him.
4181920 4184010 When? When he<br />promised you half his share?
4184010 4187430 No. His whole share. Besides,<br />he said he'd done it before.
4187430 4189680 What, with Mal? Because<br />that worked so good?
4189680 4193260 That has nothing to do with it. I did<br />what I had to to get to my children.
4193270 4195350 You led us into a war<br />zone with no way out?
4195350 4199560 There is a way out. We continue on with the<br />job, and we do it as fast as possible...
4199560 4202070 and we get out using<br />the kick, just like before.
4202070 4204690 Forget it. We go any deeper,<br />we just raise the Stakes.
4204690 4206740 I am sitting this<br />one out on this level.
4206740 4209320 COBB: Fischer's security<br />is surrounding this place.
4209320 4211740 Ten hours of flight time<br />is a week at this level.
4211740 4216080 That means each and every one of us<br />will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
4216080 4221080 We have no other choice but to<br />continue on and do it as fast as possible.
4221460 4225460 Downwards is the<br />only way forwards.
4225460 4226760 Get ready.
4226760 4231760 You, come on. Let's<br />go shake him up.
4233810 4237020 I'm insured against<br />kidnapping for up to 10 million.
4237020 4240100 - This should be very simple.<br />COBB: Shut up! It won't be.
4240100 4242560 ARTHUR: In your father's<br />office, below the bookshelves...
4242570 4244770 is his personal safe.<br />We need the combination.
4245990 4247610 I don't know any safe.
4247610 4252120 COBB: That doesn't mean<br />you don't know the combination.
4252120 4254280 Tell us what it is.
4254290 4259290 I don't know.
4260960 4263290 We have it on good<br />authority you do know.
4263290 4267130 Yeah? Whose authority?
4267130 4270880 - Five hundred dollars, this cost.<br />EAMES: What's inside it?
4270890 4275890 Cash, cards, ID. And this.
4279690 4281940 Useful?
4281940 4283440 Maybe.
4283440 4285650 You're on. You've got an hour.
4285650 4287980 An hour?
4287990 4290400 I was supposed to have<br />all night to crack this.
4290400 4293160 And Saito wasn't supposed<br />to be shot in the Chest.
4293160 4297200 You've got one hour, now get<br />us something useful, please.
4298870 4303870 - What's that?<br />- Good authority.
4305540 4307960 Uncle Peter.
4307960 4310380 Just make them stop.
4310380 4312880 - The combination.<br />- I don't know it.
4312890 4315720 - Why does Browning say you do?<br />- I don't know.
4315720 4320560 Just let me talk to<br />him and I'll find out.
4320560 4325270 You have one<br />hour. Start talking.
4325270 4326650 FISCHER: You all right?
4328360 4329360 You okay?
4333360 4337700 Those bastards have<br />had at me for two days.
4337700 4340370 They have someone with<br />access to your father's office.
4340370 4342370 - They're trying to open his safe.<br />- Yeah.
4342370 4345290 They thought I'd know the<br />combination, but I don't know it.
4345290 4348800 - Yeah, well, neither do I, so...<br />- What?
4348800 4352220 Maurice told me that when he passed,<br />you were the only one able to open it.
4352220 4355470 No, he never gave<br />me any combination.
4355470 4359760 Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you<br />just didn't know it was a combination.
4359770 4361140 Well, what, then?
4361140 4363850 I don't know, some meaningful<br />combination of numbers...
4363850 4368850 based on your<br />experiences with Maurice.
4369480 4374150 We didn't have very many,<br />meaningful experiences together.
4374160 4378280 Perhaps after your mother died.
4378280 4382660 After my mother died,<br />you know what he told me?
4382660 4387660 "Robert, there's really<br />nothing to be said."
4387790 4390300 Well, he was bad with emotion.
4390300 4393760 I was 11, Uncle Peter.
4393760 4397180 - How's he doing?<br />- He's in a lot of pain.
4397180 4400930 When we get down to the lower<br />levels, the pain will be less intense.
4400930 4403350 And if he dies?
4403350 4404980 Worst-case scenario?
4404980 4407850 When he wakes up, his<br />mind is completely gone.
4407860 4412110 Cobb, I'll still honor<br />the arrangement.
4412110 4413940 COBB: I appreciate that, Saito.
4413940 4418200 But when you wake up, you won't even<br />remember that we had an arrangement.
4418200 4420410 Limbo is gonna<br />become your reality.
4420410 4424620 You're gonna be lost down there so<br />long that you're gonna become an old man.
4424620 4427420 Filled with regret?
4427420 4429170 Waiting to die alone.
4429170 4430840 No.
4430840 4433300 I'll come back.
4433300 4438300 And we'll be young<br />men together again.
4441930 4443140 Breathe.
4443140 4446350 These people are gonna kill us if<br />we don't give them the combination.
4446350 4448440 - They just wanna ransom us.<br />- I heard them.
4448440 4452480 They're gonna lock us in that<br />van, and then drive it into the river.
4452480 4455070 All right. What is in the safe?
4455070 4456860 Something for you.
4456860 4461740 Maurice always said it was<br />his most precious gift to you.
4461740 4464990 - A will.<br />- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
4465000 4466370 That's an alternate.
4466370 4468920 This would supersede<br />the other if you want it to.
4468920 4471710 It splits up the component<br />businesses of Fischer Morrow.
4471710 4475590 It'd be the end of the<br />entire empire as we know it.
4475590 4479720 Destroying my whole inheritance?
4479720 4484720 - Why would he suggest such a thing?<br />- I just don't know.
4485770 4488310 He loved you, Robert.
4488310 4490100 In his own way.
4490100 4493190 FISCHER: In his own way.
4493190 4495860 At the end...
4495860 4498700 he called me in to his deathbed.
4498700 4501610 He could barely speak.
4501620 4506620 But he took the trouble<br />to tell me one last thing.
4508370 4512670 He pulled me close.
4512670 4515630 And I could only make out...
4515630 4516630 one word.
4520760 4525760 "Disappointed."
4528390 4531140 When were you in limbo?
4531150 4534810 You might have the rest of the team<br />convinced to carry on with this job.
4534820 4537400 - But they don't know the truth.<br />- Truth? What truth?
4537400 4541700 The truth that, at any minute, you might<br />bring a freight train through the wall.
4541700 4545910 The truth that Mal is bursting<br />through your subconscious.
4545910 4548490 And the truth that, as we<br />go deeper into Fischer...
4548500 4551120 we're also going<br />deeper into you.
4551120 4556120 And I'm not sure we're<br />gonna like what we find.
4558420 4560050 We were working together.
4560050 4563930 We were exploring the concept<br />of a dream within a dream.
4563930 4565350 I kept pushing things.
4565350 4569520 I wanted to go deeper and<br />deeper. I wanted to go further.
4569520 4574520 I just didn't understand the concept that<br />hours could turn into years down there...
4574560 4578110 that we could get<br />trapped so deep...
4578110 4582030 that when we wound up on the<br />shore of our own subconscious...
4582030 4587030 <i>we lost sight of what was real.</i>
4590620 4594830 We created. We built<br />the world for ourselves.
4594830 4597960 <i>We did that for years.</i>
4597960 4601300 <i>We built our own world.</i>
4601300 4604180 How long were you stuck there?
4604180 4609180 Something like 50 years.
4609680 4613140 Jesus.
4613140 4614640 How could you stand it?
4614650 4617560 It wasn't so bad at<br />first, feeling like gods.
4617560 4620780 <i>The problem was knowing<br />that none of it was real.</i>
4620780 4625320 Eventually, it just became<br />impossible for me to live like that.
4625320 4630200 And what about for her?
4630200 4635200 <i>She had looked something</i><br />away, <i>something deep inside her.</i>
4635500 4640500 <i>A truth that she had once<br />known, but chose to forget.</i>
4643670 4647510 Limbo became her reality.
4647510 4649850 What happened when you woke up?
4649850 4654600 Well, to wake up from that<br />after years, after decades...
4654600 4659600 <i>to become old souls thrown<br />back into youth like that?</i>
4660020 4665020 <i>I knew something was wrong<br />with her. She just wouldn't admit it.</i>
4665150 4667860 Eventually, she<br />told me the truth.
4667870 4671370 <i>She was possessed by an idea.</i>
4671370 4676370 <i>This one very simple idea<br />that changed everything.</i>
4678210 4681630 That our world wasn't real.
4681630 4686420 That she needed to wake<br />up to come back to reality...
4686430 4690050 that in order to<br />get back home...
4690050 4695050 we had to kill ourselves.
4698480 4702110 <i>- What about your children?<br />- She thought they were projeotions...</i>
4702110 4705280 <i>That our real children were<br />waiting for us up there somewhere.</i>
4705280 4707150 MAL: I'm their mother!<br />COBB: Calm down.
4707150 4708570 I can tell the difference.
4708570 4711070 If this is my dream,<br />why can't I control this?
4711070 4712950 You don't know you're dreaming!
4712950 4715330 COBB: <i>She was certain<br />there was nothing I could do...</i>
4715330 4720330 No matter how much I begged,<br />no matter how much I pleaded.
4722130 4725340 She wanted to do it, but<br />she could not do it alone.
4725340 4730340 <i>She loved me too much, so she<br />came up with</i> a <i>plan on our anniversary.</i>
4757910 4760870 - Sweetheart, what are you doing?<br />- Join me.
4760870 4765290 Just... Just step back inside. All right?<br />Just step back inside now, come on.
4765300 4769920 No. I'm going to jump,<br />and you're coming with me.
4769930 4771800 No, I'm not.
4771800 4774470 Now, you listen to me.
4774470 4778890 If you jump, you're not gonna wake<br />up, remember? You're gonna die.
4778890 4780980 Now, just step back inside.
4780980 4783900 Come on. Step back inside<br />so we can talk about this.
4783900 4787900 We've talked enough.
4787900 4789740 - Mal.<br />- Come out onto the ledge...
4789740 4794740 - ...or I'll jump right now.<br />- Okay.
4796700 4799370 We're gonna talk about this.
4799370 4800710 All right?
4800710 4805710 - I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.<br />- No, honey.
4806750 4809920 No, I can't. You<br />know I can't do that.
4809920 4812840 Take a second, think<br />about our children.
4812840 4815340 Think about James.
4815350 4817140 Think about Phillipa, now.
4817140 4820220 If I go without you, they'll<br />take them away anyway.
4820230 4823980 - What does that mean?<br />- I filed a letter with our attorney...
4823980 4828980 explaining how I'm<br />fearful for my safety.
4829530 4834490 How you've<br />threatened to kill me.
4834490 4837280 - Why did you do this?<br />- I love you, Dom.
4837280 4839200 Why did...? Why<br />would you do this to me?
4839200 4842250 I've freed you from the guilt<br />of choosing to leave them.
4842250 4845460 We're going home<br />to our real children.
4845460 4849250 No, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,<br />all right? Mal, look at me, please?
4849250 4851050 You're waiting for a train.
4851050 4854800 - Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!<br />- A train that will take you far away.
4854800 4856970 James and Phillipa<br />are waiting for you!
4856970 4860970 You know where you hope this train<br />will take you, but you can't know for sure.
4860970 4863350 - Mal, look at me!<br />- But it doesn't matter.
4863350 4866730 - Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!<br />- Because you'll be together.
4866730 4870730 Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!
4870730 4875660 <i>Jesus Christ!</i>
4875660 4879580 She had herself declared sane<br />by three different psychiatrists.
4879580 4883910 It made it impossible for me to try<br />to explain the nature of her madness.
4883910 4885330 <i>So I ran.</i>
4887000 4892000 MAN: Right now, or never, Cobb.
4895590 4900510 WOMAN: James! Phillipa!<br />Come on in! Come on!
4900510 4902100 All right, let's go.
4902100 4906480 I left my children behind and I've been<br />trying to buy my way back ever since.
4906480 4910520 Your guilt defines her.<br />It's what powers her.
4910520 4915070 But you are not responsible<br />for the idea that destroyed her.
4915070 4917780 And if we are gonna<br />succeed in this...
4917780 4922780 you have to forgive yourself, and<br />you're gonna have to confront her.
4922950 4924950 But you don't have<br />to do that alone.
4924960 4927870 - No, you're not...<br />- I'm doing it for the others.
4927870 4932870 Because they have no idea the risk<br />they've taken coming down here with you.
4938050 4939720 We have to move.
4939720 4941300 Time's up.
4941300 4944220 All right. I don't know<br />any combination.
4944220 4947480 - Not consciously, anyway.<br />- COBB: How about instinctively?
4947480 4951610 I got somebody in your father's office<br />right now ready to tap in the combination.
4951610 4954650 Give me the first six numbers<br />that come to your head right now.
4954650 4957070 - I have no idea.<br />- Right now!
4957070 4959490 I said, right now! Right now!
4959490 4964490 Five, two, eight,<br />four, nine, one.
4967250 4969420 You'll have to do<br />better than that.
4969420 4974420 All right. Bag them.<br />You're going for a ride.
4977130 4982130 FISCHER: We're worth more<br />to you alive. You hear me?
4986520 4988430 What'd you get?
4988440 4991150 Relationship with his father<br />is worse than we imagined.
4991150 4992350 This helps us how?
4992360 4996650 The stronger the issues, the<br />more powerful the catharsis.
4996650 4999900 - How are we gonna reconcile them?<br />- I'm working on that.
4999910 5003620 Work faster. The projections<br />are closing in quick.
5003620 5008620 We gotta break out of here<br />before we're totally boxed in.
5042280 5043490 Damn it.
5043490 5048490 You mustn't be afraid to<br />dream a little bigger, darling.
5063260 5066430 We need to shift his animosity<br />from his father to his godfather.
5066430 5068310 Destroy his one<br />positive relationship?
5068320 5070600 No, repair his relationship<br />with his father...
5070600 5073100 whilst exposing his<br />godfather's true nature.
5073100 5076270 We should charge Fischer a<br />lot more than Saito for this job.
5076270 5078770 His security is gonna get<br />worse as we go deeper.
5078780 5081690 - I think we run with Mr. Charles.<br />- No.
5081700 5083280 EAMES: Who's Mr. Charles?<br />- Bad idea.
5083280 5086990 The second we get into that hotel<br />his security's gonna be all over us.
5086990 5089290 We run with Mr. Charles<br />like on the Stein job.
5089290 5091790 - You've done it before?<br />ARTHUR: Yeah, and it didn't work.
5091790 5095460 The subject realized he was dreaming<br />and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
5095460 5097630 Excellent. But you<br />learned a lot, right?
5097630 5099920 - I need some kind of distraction.<br />EAMES: No problem.
5099920 5102300 How about a lovely lady<br />that I've used before?
5102300 5104510 Listen to me. You<br />drive carefully, all right?
5104510 5109510 Everything down there is<br />gonna be unstable as hell.
5111520 5115060 Don't jump too soon. We only got<br />one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
5115060 5118520 I'll play the music to let you know<br />it's coming. The rest is on you.
5118520 5121570 - You ready?<br />- Ready!
5121570 5122820 Sweet dreams.
5122820 5126030 WOMAN: Am I boring you?
5126030 5131030 I was telling you my story. I<br />guess it wasn't to your liking.
5131080 5135290 Um, I have a lot on my mind.
5135290 5140290 There goes Mr. Charles.
5141590 5144380 Mr. Fischer, right?
5144380 5148050 Pleasure to see you again.<br />Rod Green from marketing. I...
5149350 5154350 - And you must be?<br />- Leaving.
5155270 5160270 In case you get bored.
5161650 5163190 Must've blown you off.
5163190 5168070 That is, unless her phone<br />number really is only six digits.
5168070 5173070 Funny way to make friends,<br />someone stealing your wallet like that.
5176460 5178960 Goddamn it. The wallet<br />alone is worth at least 500...
5178960 5180250 About $500, right?
5180250 5183380 Don't worry about it. My people<br />are already on it as we speak.
5183380 5185550 Who or what is Mr. Charles?
5185550 5189390 It's a gambit designed to turn<br />Fischer against his own subconscious.
5189390 5190890 ARIADNE: And why<br />don't you approve?
5190890 5193060 It involves telling the<br />mark that he's dreaming...
5193060 5195390 which involves attracting<br />a lot of attention to us.
5195390 5198480 Didn't Cobb say<br />never to do that?
5198480 5200400 So now you've noticed<br />how much time...
5200400 5204780 Cobb spends doing<br />things he says never to do.
5204780 5206740 Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
5206740 5210490 - I'm sorry, but...<br />MAN: Hold on! Wait!
5210490 5211950 You look a bit perkier.
5211950 5216950 Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
5220540 5222210 Turbulence on the plane?
5222210 5224090 No, it's much closer.
5224090 5226630 That's Yusuf's driving.
5234100 5236720 Um, I'm sorry. Who<br />did you say you were?
5236730 5238980 COBB: Rod Green from marketing.
5238980 5242690 But that's not<br />true at all, is it?
5242690 5246360 My name is Mr. Charles.<br />You remember me, don't you?
5246360 5249610 I'm the head of your<br />security down here.
5249610 5251700 Get out on a different<br />floor, keep moving.
5251700 5254200 Dump the wallet. Security<br />will be looking for that.
5254200 5259200 - Okay.<br />- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
5261330 5265340 Security?
5265340 5267670 - You work for the hotel?<br />- No, no.
5267670 5272670 I specialize in a very<br />specific type of security.
5272680 5274510 Subconscious security.
5274510 5276810 You're talking about dreams?
5276810 5280680 Are you talking<br />about, om, extraction?
5280690 5282270 I am here to protect you.
5295530 5298240 Mr. Fischer, I'm here to<br />protect you in the event...
5298240 5301790 that someone tries to access<br />your mind through your dreams.
5301790 5305250 You're not safe here.
5305250 5310250 They're coming for you.
5325190 5330190 Strange weather, isn't it?
5332070 5335200 You feel that?
5335200 5336530 What's happening?
5336530 5339950 Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention<br />to the strangeness of the dream...
5339950 5343000 which is making his<br />subconscious look for the dreamer.
5343000 5348000 For me. Quick, give me a kiss.
5351050 5355590 - They're still looking at us.<br />- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
5355590 5360590 We should probably<br />get out of here.
5372900 5376660 COBB: You feel that? You've actually<br />been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
5376660 5380830 Pay attention to the strangeness<br />of the weather, the shift in gravity.
5380830 5385830 None of this is real.<br />You're in a dream.
5388790 5391250 Now, the easiest way<br />for you to test yourself...
5391250 5396130 is to try and remember how you<br />arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
5396130 5397590 Yeah, I...
5397590 5402140 COBB: No, breathe, breathe.<br />Remember your training.
5402140 5407140 Accept the fact that you're in a dream,<br />and I'm here to protect you. Go on.
5411650 5413650 - You're not real?<br />- No.
5413650 5417200 No. I'm a projection<br />of your subconscious.
5417200 5419450 I was sent here to<br />protect you in the event...
5419450 5422530 that extractors tried to<br />pull you into a dream.
5422540 5426870 And I believe that's what's<br />going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
5426870 5428080 Yeah.
5428080 5430580 <i>Okay-</i>
5434130 5437050 Can you get me out of here?
5437050 5442050 Right away. Follow me.
5453860 5458860 Hold on a second.
5460160 5462160 Jesus Christ! What<br />are you doing?
5462160 5464580 These men were sent<br />here to abduct you, all right?
5464580 5468870 If you want my help,<br />you have to remain calm.
5468870 5473870 I need you to work<br />with me, Mr. Fischer.
5482890 5486680 If this is a dream, I should<br />just kill myself to wake up, right?
5486680 5488930 I wouldn't do that if I<br />were you, Mr. Fischer.
5488940 5492600 I believe they have you sedated,<br />and if you pull that trigger...
5492610 5494900 you may not wake up.
5494900 5499900 You may go into a further dream state.<br />Now, you know what I'm talking about.
5501530 5504370 You remember the training.
5504370 5506620 Remember what I said to you.
5506620 5511620 Give me the gun.
5519590 5523470 - This room should be directly below 528?<br />- Yeah.
5531560 5533230 Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
5533230 5537440 What do you remember<br />from before this dream?
5537440 5540240 There was, om, a lot of gunfire.
5540240 5543410 There was rain.
5543410 5545240 Uncle Peter.
5545240 5550240 - My God, we've been kidnapped.<br />- Where were they holding you?
5551910 5555420 - They had us in the back of a van.<br />- That explains the gravity shifts.
5555420 5557630 You're in the back<br />of a van. Keep going.
5557630 5560550 It had something<br />to do with, om...
5560550 5564050 Something to do with a safe.
5564050 5565840 God, why is it so<br />hard to remember?
5565850 5568720 It's like trying to remember a<br />dream after you've woken up.
5568720 5570600 Listen, it takes<br />years of practice.
5570600 5573190 You and Browning have<br />been pulled into this dream...
5573190 5576100 because they're trying to<br />steal something from your mind.
5576110 5579860 I need you to focus and try<br />and remember what that is.
5579860 5581650 What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
5581650 5585570 A combination. They demanded<br />the first numbers to pop into my head.
5585570 5588450 They're trying to extract a<br />number from your subconscious.
5588450 5593040 It can represent anything.<br />We're in a hotel right now.
5593040 5596330 We should try hotel rooms.<br />What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
5596330 5599340 Try and remember for<br />me. This is very important.
5599340 5601630 Five.
5601630 5604260 Five, two... It was something,<br />it was a long number.
5604260 5606510 That's good. We can<br />start there. Fifth floor.
5606510 5607720 Yep.
5607720 5611970 - So do you use a timer?<br />- No, I have to judge it for myself.
5611970 5615390 While you're all asleep in<br />528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.
5615390 5617690 - Well, how will you know?<br />- His music warns me.
5617690 5621820 And then when the van hits the barrier<br />of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
5621820 5625150 So we get a nice<br />synchronized kick.
5625150 5627740 If it's too soon, we<br />won't get pulled out.
5627740 5631160 But if it's too late, I<br />won't be able to drop us.
5631160 5635500 - Well, why not?<br />- Because the van will be in freefall.
5635500 5640500 - Can't drop you without gravity.<br />- Right.
5644010 5649010 They're with me. Go on.
5670530 5671740 Mr. Charles.
5671740 5674870 - Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?<br />- Yeah, I think so.
5674870 5677370 They were trying<br />to put you under.
5677370 5679620 - I'm already under.<br />- Under again.
5679630 5682790 What do you mean, a<br />dream within a dream?
5682800 5685420 Hey. I see you've changed.
5685420 5687550 I'm sorry?
5687550 5691600 I'm sorry. I mistook<br />you for a friend.
5693060 5695850 Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
5695850 5698940 No, no, no. That's Fischer's<br />projection of Browning.
5698940 5700980 Let's follow him and<br />see how he behaves.
5700980 5703110 - Why?<br />- Because how he acts will tell us...
5703110 5706610 if Fischer is starting to suspect<br />his motives the way we want him to.
5706610 5707820 Shh.
5712240 5714910 - Uncle Peter.<br />- You said you were kidnapped together?
5714910 5718500 Well, not exactly. They already<br />had him. They were torturing him.
5718500 5723500 And you saw them torture him?
5727510 5730300 The kidnappers<br />are working for you?
5730300 5731930 Robert.
5731930 5736180 You're trying to get that safe<br />open? To get the alternate will?
5736180 5740600 Fischer Morrow has been my<br />entire life. I can't let you destroy it.
5740600 5743100 I'm not gonna throw<br />away my inheritance.
5743110 5748110 I couldn't let you rise to<br />your father's last taunt.
5748110 5751280 - What taunt?<br />- The will, Robert. That will?
5751280 5753410 That's his last insult.
5753410 5757200 A challenge for you to<br />build something for yourself...
5757200 5762200 by telling you you're not<br />worthy of his accomplishments.
5766670 5771670 - What, but that he was, um, disappointed?<br />- I'm sorry.
5773430 5777260 But he's wrong.
5777270 5780060 You can build a better<br />company than he ever did.
5780060 5782640 Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
5782650 5784940 - How do you know?<br />- Trust me, it's what I do.
5784940 5788900 He's hiding something, and<br />we need to find out what that is.
5788900 5793900 I need you to do the same thing to<br />him that he was going to do to you.
5794870 5799870 We'll enter his subconscious and find<br />out what he doesn't want you to know.
5800200 5802080 All right.
5807670 5809090 - COBB: He's out.<br />- Wait.
5809090 5811340 Whose subconscious<br />are we going into exactly?
5811340 5812840 We're going into Fischer's.
5812840 5815680 I told him it was Browning's<br />so he'd be a part of our team.
5815680 5818180 He's gonna help us break<br />into his own subconscious.
5818180 5819930 COBB: That's right.
5819930 5822180 Security's gonna<br />run you down hard.
5822180 5825060 And I will lead them<br />on a merry Chase.
5825060 5830060 - Just be back before the kick.<br />- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
5832900 5837280 ARTHUR: You good?
5837280 5838780 Hey. You ready?
5838780 5843780 Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.
5854930 5856930 ARIADNE: Cobb?
5856930 5861930 Cobb? What's down there?
5862730 5865520 Hopefully, the truth we<br />want Fischer to learn.
5865520 5870520 I mean, what's<br />down there for you?
6024010 6029010 Did you see that?
6044240 6046240 COBB: Eames, this is your dream.
6046240 6049540 I need you to draw the security<br />away from the complex, understand?
6049540 6051500 - Who guides Fischer in?<br />COBB: Not me.
6051500 6054120 If I know the route, everything<br />could be compromised.
6054120 6056830 - I designed the place.<br />COBB: No, you're with me.
6056840 6058800 SAITO: I could do it.
6058800 6061420 All right. Brief him on<br />the route into the complex.
6061420 6065760 - Fischer, you'll be going with him.<br />- All right. What about you?
6065760 6068760 You keep this live. I'll be<br />listening in the whole time.
6068760 6073100 The windows on that upper floor are big<br />enough for me to cover you from that tower.
6073100 6074560 FISCHER: You're not coming in?
6074560 6077060 In order to find out the<br />truth about your father...
6077060 6080940 you're gonna need to break<br />into Browning's mind on your own.
6080940 6085940 SAITO: Come on, Fischer!
6137500 6141340 - Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!<br />- Go, go, go!
6141340 6144420 Move!
6144420 6145420 Go!
6160690 6165690 YUSUP Sod it.
6172910 6174870 I hope you're ready.
6183340 6187880 No, it's too soon.
6191600 6192970 Cobb, do you hear that?
6192970 6197060 I first noticed it about 20 minutes<br />ago, I thought it was the wind up here.
6197060 6199730 Yeah, I hear it. It's music.
6199730 6201310 So, what do we do?
6201310 6206310 We move fast.
6208240 6212320 Yusuf's 10 seconds<br />from the jump.
6212320 6215620 Which gives Arthur<br />three minutes.
6215620 6218410 - Hey!<br />- That's him!
6218410 6220290 - Which gives us what?<br />- Sixty minutes.
6220290 6223750 - Can they make that route in an hour?<br />- They have to climb to the terrace.
6223750 6228750 Then they need a new<br />route, a more direct route.
6237810 6239600 It's designed as a labyrinth.
6239600 6242270 There must be access routes<br />that cut through the maze.
6242270 6243270 Eames?
6266960 6268380 Did Eames add any features?
6268380 6270010 I don't think I should tell you.
6270010 6272760 We don't have time for<br />this. Did he add anything?
6272760 6274180 He added an air-duct system...
6274180 6279180 - ...that can cut through the maze.<br />- Good. Explain it to them.
6311630 6313340 Paradox.
6383080 6385750 ARIADNE: What was that?<br />- The kick.
6385750 6387790 Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?
6387790 6389670 Yeah, we missed it.
6389670 6391040 FISCHER: Man.
6391040 6395510 Couldn't someone have<br />dreamt up a goddamn beach?
6397510 6399840 EAMES: Well, what<br />the hell do we do now?
6399850 6401850 We finish the job<br />before the next kick.
6401850 6406850 - What next kick?<br />- When the van hits the water.
6426790 6430420 WOMAN: <i>If you'd like to make a<br />call, please hang up and try again.</i>
6430420 6432460 <i>If you need help, hang up...</i>
6432460 6437460 How do I drop<br />you without gravity?
6438300 6443300 Arthur has a couple minutes,<br />and we have about 20.
6464370 6465370 You okay?
6470500 6474540 SOLDIER: Run! Turn around!<br />Move to base! Move to base!
6474540 6478260 Go, go, go!
6478260 6479590 There's something wrong.
6479590 6483180 They're heading your way,<br />like they know something.
6483180 6485550 Just buy us more<br />time, all right?
6485560 6487560 - Come on!<br />- On my way.
6487560 6492560 SOLDIER: Come on! Move!
6573440 6578440 All right.
6587160 6590120 Okay. That's the antechamber<br />outside the strong room.
6590120 6593790 - Does the strong room have windows?<br />- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.
6593790 6597670 Let's hope Fischer likes<br />what he finds in there.
6597670 6601170 - Are those projections his subconscious?<br />- Yes.
6601170 6606170 - Are you destroying parts of his mind?<br />- No. They're just projections.
6630830 6632740 - We're here.<br />- You're clear, but hurry.
6632740 6637740 There's an entire<br />army headed your way.
6661400 6663400 I'm in.
6668070 6673070 SOLDIER: There he is.
6711780 6715660 - There's someone in there.<br />- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.
6715660 6720660 Come on. Come<br />on, a little lower.
6723960 6725750 ARIADNE: Cobb.
6725750 6728920 No, she is not real.
6728920 6730300 How do you know that?
6730300 6735300 She is just a projection.<br />Fischer. Fischer is real.
6737930 6738930 Hello.
6744150 6749150 ARIADNE: Eames! Eames,<br />get to the antechamber now!
6791280 6796280 EAMES: What happened?<br />- Mal killed Fischer.
6796410 6799120 I couldn't shoot her.
6799120 6802660 There's no use in reviving him. His<br />mind's already trapped down there.
6802660 6805460 It's all over.
6805460 6807710 So that's it, then? We failed?
6807710 6812710 We're done. I'm sorry.
6813760 6817090 It's not me that doesn't<br />get back to my family, is it?
6817100 6821180 Shame. I wanted to know what was<br />gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
6821180 6825060 Let's set the charges.
6825060 6827860 No, there's still another way.
6827860 6831440 - We have to follow Fischer down there.<br />- Not enough time.
6831440 6835400 No, but there will be<br />enough time down there.
6835410 6836700 And we will find him.
6836700 6840780 Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,<br />just use the defibrillator to revive him.
6840790 6844710 We can give him his<br />own kick down below.
6844710 6846580 Look, you get him in there.
6846580 6849630 As soon as the music ends,<br />you blow up the hospital...
6849630 6853630 and we all ride the<br />kick back up the layers.
6853630 6858550 It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold<br />the guards off while I set the charges.
6858550 6862720 Saito will never<br />make it, will he?
6862720 6865350 - Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.<br />- Go for it.
6865350 6868440 If you are not back before the<br />kick, I am gone with or without you.
6868440 6873440 She's right. She's<br />right. Come on. Let's go.
6875900 6878280 Can I trust you to do what<br />needs to happen here?
6878280 6879660 Mal's gonna be down there.
6879660 6882240 I know where to find<br />her. She'll have Fischer.
6882240 6886330 - How do you know?<br />- Because she wants me to come after him.
6886330 6891330 She wants me back<br />down there with her.
6915280 6920280 All right?
6923540 6927000 - This is your world?<br />- It was.
6927000 6929670 And this is where she'll be.
6929670 6931830 Come on.
6977710 6980630 Saito. Saito.
6980630 6984760 I need you to take care of Fischer<br />while I go set some charges, okay?
6984760 6989760 No room for tourists<br />on these jobs.
6990850 6995850 Don't be silly.
7024510 7027050 ARIADNE: You built all<br />this? This is incredible.
7027060 7030100 We built for years.
7030100 7035100 Then we started<br />in on the memories.
7039150 7040150 This way.
7082240 7084490 COBB: This was our neighborhood.
7084490 7086990 Places from our past.
7086990 7088950 That was our first apartment.
7088950 7091330 Then we moved to<br />that building right there.
7091330 7094040 After Mal became pregnant,<br />that became our home.
7094040 7097000 You reconstructed all<br />of this from memory?
7097000 7099460 Like I told you,<br />we had lots of time.
7099460 7102590 ARIADNE: What is that?
7102590 7104510 That's the house Mal grew up in.
7104510 7107300 - Well, will she be in there?<br />- No.
7107300 7108470 Come on.
7108470 7111970 We both wanted to live in a house,<br />but we loved this type of building.
7111970 7116970 In the real world, we'd<br />have to choose, but not here.
7155520 7157930 How are we gonna<br />bring Fischer back?
7157940 7160520 We're gonna have to come<br />up with some kind of a kick.
7160520 7162940 What?
7162940 7164190 I'm gonna improvise.
7164190 7169190 Listen, there's something you should<br />know about me. About inoeption.
7181960 7186670 An idea is like<br />a virus. Resilient.
7186670 7188380 Highly contagious.
7188380 7192800 And the smallest seed<br />of an idea can grow.
7192800 7195810 It can grow to define...
7195810 7200520 or destroy you.
7200520 7203900 MAL: The smallest idea, such as:
7203900 7206530 "Your world is not real."
7206530 7211530 Simple little thought<br />that changes everything.
7211530 7216200 So certain of your<br />world. Of what's real.
7216200 7219790 Do you think he is?
7219790 7223830 Or do you think<br />he's as lost as I was?
7223840 7227420 COBB: I know what's real, Mal.
7227420 7230420 No creeping doubts?
7230420 7233340 Not feeling persecuted, Dom?
7233340 7234850 Chased around the globe...
7234850 7237680 by anonymous corporations<br />and police forces...
7237680 7241940 the way the projections<br />persecute the dreamer?
7241940 7244730 Admit it.
7244730 7247730 You don't believe in<br />one reality anymore.
7247730 7249440 So choose.
7249440 7254440 Choose to be here. Choose me.
7279560 7280970 You know what I have to do.
7280980 7284980 I have to get back to our<br />children because you left them.
7284980 7286690 Because you left us.
7286690 7288650 - You're wrong.<br />COBB: I'm not wrong.
7288650 7291820 You're confused.
7291820 7294650 Our children are here.
7294660 7298070 And you'd like to see their<br />faces again, wouldn't you?
7298080 7301330 Yes, but I'm gonna<br />see them up above, Mal.
7314800 7317680 Up above?
7317680 7321850 Listen to yourself.<br />These are our children.
7321850 7323730 Watch.
7323730 7325600 James? Phillipa?
7325600 7328190 Don't do this, Mal. Please.<br />Those aren't my children.
7328190 7330860 You keep telling yourself<br />that, but you don't believe it.
7330860 7333150 - No, I know it.<br />- What if you're wrong?
7333150 7336660 What if I'm what's real?
7336660 7340450 You keep telling<br />yourself what you know.
7340450 7343660 But what do you believe?
7343660 7347040 What do you feel?
7347040 7349670 Guilt.
7349670 7352420 I feel guilt, Mal.
7352420 7356550 And no matter what I do, no<br />matter how hopeless I am...
7356550 7360970 no matter how confused,<br />that guilt is always there...
7360970 7364020 reminding me of the truth.
7364020 7367730 What truth?
7367730 7372730 That the idea that caused you to<br />question your reality came from me.
7376360 7380990 You planted the idea in my mind?
7380990 7383410 What is she talking about?
7383410 7388410 The reason I knew inception was<br />possible was because I did it to her first.
7389710 7393420 - I did it to my own wife.<br />- Why?
7393420 7395840 We were lost in here.
7395840 7400840 <i>I knew we needed to escape,<br />but she wouldn't accept it.</i>
7403680 7408680 <i>She had looked something</i><br />away, <i>something deep inside.</i>
7410100 7415100 <i>A truth that she had once<br />known, but chose to forget.</i>
7415230 7420070 And she couldn't break free.
7420070 7423370 <i>So I decided to search for it.</i>
7423370 7428370 <i>I went deep into the recess of her<br />mind and found that secret place.</i>
7428410 7430870 <i>And I broke in...</i>
7430880 7433790 <i>And I planted an idea.</i>
7433790 7438790 <i>A simple little idea that<br />would change everything.</i>
7442800 7447800 <i>That her world wasn't real.</i>
7457990 7462990 That death was the only escape.
7468580 7470500 You're waiting for a train.
7472670 7476540 A train that'll<br />take you far away.
7476550 7480670 You know where you<br />hope this train will take you...
7480670 7483840 but you can't know for sure.
7483840 7486850 Yet it doesn't matter.
7486850 7491850 - Now, tell me why!<br />- Because you'll be together!
7494360 7498570 COBB: <i>But I never knew that that idea<br />would grow in her mind like a cancer...</i>
7498570 7503570 <i>That even after she woke..., </i>
7503860 7508860 That even after you<br />came back to reality...
7509290 7514290 that you'd continue to<br />believe your world wasn't real.
7515040 7517590 That death was the only escape.
7517590 7520420 Mal, no! Jesus!
7520420 7524300 - You infected my mind.<br />- I was trying to save you.
7524300 7526550 You betrayed me.
7526550 7530390 But you can make amends.<br />You can still keep your promise.
7530390 7533600 We can still be<br />together, right here...
7533600 7538600 in the world we built together.
7616890 7620100 Cobb, we need to get Fischer.
7620110 7622440 You can't have him.
7622440 7627440 - If I stay here, will you let him go?<br />- What are you talking about?
7630320 7632740 Fischer is on the porch.
7632740 7635500 - Go check he's alive, Ariadne.<br />- Cobb, you can't do this.
7635500 7640500 Go check he's<br />alive right now. Do it.
7653810 7657060 He's here! And it's time,<br />but you have to come now!
7657060 7662060 COBB: You take Fischer with you, all right?<br />- You can't stay here to be with her.
7663320 7666190 I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
7666190 7671190 That means he's down here<br />somewhere. That means I have to find him.
7671700 7674950 I can't stay with her anymore,<br />because she doesn't exist.
7674950 7678540 I'm the only thing you<br />do believe in anymore.
7678540 7681040 No.
7681040 7684040 I wish.
7684040 7687670 I wish more than<br />anything, but...
7687670 7690550 I can't imagine you<br />with all your complexity...
7690550 7694220 all your perfection,<br />all your imperfection.
7694220 7695390 - You all right?<br />- Yeah.
7695390 7698470 Look at you.
7698480 7703480 You're just a shade. You're<br />just a shade of my real wife.
7703860 7707320 And you were the best<br />that I could do, but...
7707320 7709900 I'm sorry, you're<br />just not good enough.
7709900 7711990 Does this feel real?
7713950 7718950 - What are you doing?<br />- Improvising.
7725170 7727840 No, no, no!
7727840 7732840 In there, now. Go, go, go.
7775090 7778680 I was dis\.
7778680 7781890 I was dis... Disa...
7781890 7786890 - I know, Dad.<br />- Dis...
7790440 7793320 I know you were disappointed...
7793320 7795110 I couldn't be you.
7795110 7797120 No.
7797120 7799370 No, no, no.
7799370 7803120 I was disappointed...
7803120 7808120 that you tried.
7828310 7829310 What?
7839410 7844410 Come on, come on.
7870770 7874070 Dad?
7910600 7915600 That's the kick, Ariadne!<br />You have to go now!
7926540 7930120 Don't lose yourself! Find<br />Saito and bring him back!
7930120 7931120 I will!
7971960 7974880 You remember when you<br />asked me to marry you?
7974880 7976170 Yes.
7976170 7981170 You said you dreamt that<br />we'd grow old together.
7981930 7985340 But we did.
7985350 7990350 <i>We did. You don't remember?</i>
7992390 7997390 I miss you more<br />than I can bear...
7997610 8000940 but we had our time together.
8000940 8005110 And I have to let you go.
8005120 8010120 I have to let you go.
8058170 8063170 I'm sorry, Robert.
8087110 8091870 You know, the will means that<br />Dad wanted me to be my own man...
8091870 8095500 not just to live for him.
8095500 8100500 That's what I'm<br />gonna do, Uncle Peter.
8107800 8109510 What happened?
8109510 8111390 - Cobb stayed.<br />- With Mal?
8111390 8114930 No, to find Saito.
8114930 8119230 He'll be lost.
8119230 8124230 No, he'll be all right.
8137080 8142080 SAITO: Have you come to kill me?
8143340 8148340 I'm waiting for someone.
8150260 8155260 COBB: Someone from a<br />half-remembered dream.
8155770 8157890 Cobb?
8159100 8161400 Impossible.
8161400 8165610 We were young men together.
8165610 8169200 I'm an old man.
8169200 8174200 Filled with regret.
8174370 8179370 Waiting to die alone.
8180250 8185250 I've come back for you.
8185710 8190710 To remind you of something.
8192840 8197840 Something you once knew.
8198060 8203060 That this world is not real.
8205230 8210230 To convince me to<br />honor our arrangement?
8210570 8215570 To take a leap of faith, yes.
8219410 8223290 Come back...
8223290 8228290 so we can be young<br />men together again.
8230420 8235420 Come back with me.
8235510 8240510 Come back.
8246690 8249020 FLIGHT ATTENDANT:<br />Hot towel, sir?
8249030 8252070 We'll be landing in Los<br />Angeles in about 20 minutes.
8252070 8256450 Do you need immigration forms?
8256450 8258280 Thank you.
8258290 8260910 Hot towel, sir?
8260910 8265910 - No.<br />- Do you need immigration forms?
8335280 8337490 Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
8337490 8342490 Thank you, sir.
8383160 8384990 Welcome.
8385000 8386000 This way.
8407600 8412600 MILES: James? Phillipa?
8414770 8419770 Look who's here.
8421660 8423820 <i>Hey-</i>
8423830 8426700 - Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?<br />PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!
8426700 8430080 JAMES: Daddy!<br />COBB: How are you?
8430080 8431830 Look what I've been building!
8431830 8435710 - What are you building?<br />JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!
8435710 8438760 COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want<br />you to show me. Can you show me?
8438760 8443760 JAMES: Let's go.<br />PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!
