193785 196204 [chains rattling]
211302 213054 [man grunting]
218351 220228 [horse nickering]
234409 236953 - Whoa.<br />- [horses snorting]
237120 239789 [gentle metallic rattling]
243251 244419 Whoa.
258850 262061 Who's that stumblin'<br />around in the dark?
262228 266024 State your business<br />or prepare to get winged!
266190 268776 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
268943 271279 I mean you no harm.
271446 276284 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.<br />Whoa, boy.
277618 279287 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
279454 281789 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
281956 283624 that go by the name<br />of the Speck Brothers.
283791 285626 Might that be you?
287003 289756 - Who wants to know?<br />- Well, I do.
289922 291799 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
291966 292884 [snorting]
293051 296554 - What kinda doctor?<br />- [Schultz] Dentist.
296721 298514 Now, are you the Speck Brothers?
298681 301476 And did you purchase those men<br />at the Greenville slave auction?
301642 304228 - So what?<br />- So I wish to parley with you.
304395 307732 - Speak English.<br />- [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.
307899 310109 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
310276 313571 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe,
313738 316157 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
316324 317784 Hello, you poor devils!
319118 321704 Is there one amongst you<br />who was formerly a resident
321871 325166 of the Carrucan plantation?
325917 328127 [man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
329754 331130 Who said that?
338679 339931 [Schultz lighting match]
378344 379720 What's your name?
383891 385768 Django.
385935 388688 Then you are exactly<br />the one I'm looking for.
390565 392775 Do you know who<br />the Brittle Brothers are?
396404 397405 Who are they?
399824 401450 Big John.
402243 403578 Ellis.
404996 408916 Roger.<br />Sometime they call him Lil Raj.
410293 412503 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
412670 413754 Not anymore.
416841 417884 Tell me...
418467 421262 if you were to see<br />any of these three gentlemen again,
421429 424098 - would you recognize them?<br />- [man] Hey.
424265 426726 - Stop talkin' to him like that.<br />- Like What?
426893 428436 Like that.
428603 430897 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain...
431063 433107 Speak English, goddamn it.
433274 435026 Everybody calm down.
435193 438905 I'm simply a customer<br />trying to conduct a transaction.
439071 442074 I don't care. No sale.<br />Now, off with ya.
442241 445244 [scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
446078 447538 Move it.
447705 452627 My good man, did you simply get carried<br />away with your dramatic gesture
452793 456589 or are you pointing your weapon at me<br />with lethal intention?
457673 459550 Last chance, fancy pants.
460968 463304 Oh, very well.
463971 465014 [horse whinnying]
466599 468935 [man screaming]
473064 474732 [scream echoing]
487620 490331 [screaming continues]
492083 494502 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,
494669 496587 but I didn't want you<br />to do anything rash
496754 499048 before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
499215 502635 You goddamn son of a bitch!
502802 505596 - You shot Roscoe!<br />- Well...
505763 507473 And you killed Ace!
507640 510309 I only shot your brother once<br />he threatened to shoot me.
510476 513312 And I do believe I have...<br />one, two, three, four...
513479 516440 five witnesses<br />who can attest to that fact.
516607 519485 - Damn leg's busted!<br />- No doubt.
519652 522196 Now, if you could keep your<br />caterwauling down to a minimum,
522363 525700 I'd like to finish my line<br />of inquiry with young Django.
525866 527868 [screaming resumes]
529704 533165 - [man] God-fuckin'-damn it!<br />- As I was saying...
533332 537044 if you were to see the Brittle<br />Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?
537712 539422 Yeah.
539588 540881 Sold American!
541048 545011 So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?<br />How much for young Django here?
550308 552935 That iron is nasty business.
558149 560276 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
562403 563904 Thank you. Django?
564071 565948 Get up on that horse.
566115 567908 Also, if I were you,
568075 572079 I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear departed Speck left behind.
586218 590097 Nigger!<br />Don't you touch my brother's coat.
599065 600608 [screaming]
600775 605696 Goddamn it! Oh!<br />[moaning]
607365 612536 One hundred... ten... 20...
612703 614538 and five...
615790 616957 for young Django here.
617124 619293 And since he won't<br />be needing it anymore,
619460 621962 I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
622671 627635 Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid<br />I will require a bill of sale.
627802 629387 Do you have one?
629553 632473 - You go to hell, dentist.<br />- [scoffs]
632640 634642 I thought not.
634809 638312 No worries. I come prepared.
642650 644235 Thank you.
644402 647988 This will serve nicely<br />as a bill of sale.
652910 654495 [nickering]
660334 661335 Whoa.
665506 668968 Now, as to you poor devils.
669135 674181 So, as I see it, when it comes to<br />the subject of what to do next,
674348 677184 you gentlemen have two choices.
677351 682481 One: Once I'm gone, you could lift<br />that beast off the remaining Speck,
682648 684567 then carry him to the nearest town.
684733 688320 Which would be at least<br />37 miles back the way you came.
688487 694160 Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,<br />take that rifle,
694326 696871 put a bullet in his head,<br />bury the two of them deep,
697037 700583 and then make your way to a<br />more enlightened area of this country.
701667 702835 Choice is yours.
703002 707381 Oh, and on the off chance there are<br />any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
707548 710551 the North Star is that one.
712011 715181 Ta-ta. [clucking]
729987 734074 Now wait a minute, fellas.<br />Let's talk about this!
734325 737536 - [lantern crashing]<br />- [chains rattling]
737703 741123 You gotta be reasonable<br />in a situation like this!
742583 745586 I'm not a bad guy.<br />I'm just doin' my job!
745753 749340 Blueberry, didn't I<br />give you my last apple?
749507 752468 Tell you what, boys:<br />Take me to the doc in El Paso,
752635 754678 - I'll get you your freedom.<br />- [gun cocking]
754845 758599 - No. No, please...<br />- [gunshot echoing]
774323 776158 [dogs barking nearby]
800975 803269 [squeaking]
803936 805312 All right, now.
805479 807481 I'd like you to<br />take two of these tonight...
807648 809858 - [coughing]<br />- ...and then in the morning...
811986 813779 That's a nigger on a horse.
839388 841181 What's everybody staring at?
841348 843851 They ain't never seen<br />no nigger on a horse before.
845060 847313 [goats bleating]
856155 857156 Whoa.
867207 869209 Good morning, innkeeper!
870544 873005 Two beers for two weary travelers.
873172 874923 It's still a bit early.
875090 877509 We won't be open for another hour.
877676 879511 By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.
879678 885100 [gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what<br />the hell you think you're doing, boy?
885267 887353 Get that nigger outta here!
890898 894902 - [panting] Help! Help!<br />- Innkeeper!
895069 898238 Remember, get the sheriff,<br />not the marshal.
898405 900282 [man] Sheriff! Help!
900449 902076 Alas.
903452 905996 Now we must act as our own bartender.
908415 910167 Sit down, my boy.
919843 922721 - What kind of dentist are you?<br />- [chortles]
923555 928143 Despite that cart, I haven't<br />practiced dentistry in five years.
932773 936068 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession...
938278 939655 bounty hunter.
946245 948080 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
948789 949832 No.
949998 951208 Well...
952835 956964 the way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash,
957131 959466 a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
959633 961844 [tsking] Hat
965597 967141 Prost.
975315 977985 The state places a bounty<br />on a man's head.
978152 980821 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
980988 984950 After I've killed him, I transport that<br />man's corpse back to the authorities.
985117 987828 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
987995 990789 I show that corpse to the authorities,<br />proving yes, indeed,
990956 992666 I truly have killed him,
992833 995836 at which point the authorities<br />pay me the bounty.
996003 999339 So, like slavery,<br />it's a flesh for cash business.
1000966 1001967 What's a bounty?
1005763 1007222 It's like a reward.
1007389 1010768 You kill people?<br />And they give you a reward?
1010934 1012811 Certain people, yeah.
1012978 1014104 Bad people?
1014271 1018233 Ah! Badder they are,<br />bigger the reward.
1018400 1020694 Which brings me to you.
1020861 1025115 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of<br />a quandary when it comes to you.
1025282 1027701 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1027868 1030996 On the other hand, I need your help.
1031163 1034541 If you're not in a position to refuse,<br />all the better.
1035417 1038086 So, for the time being, I'm gonna<br />make this slavery malarkey
1038253 1040464 work to my benefit.
1040631 1045302 Still, having said that, I feel guilty.
1046970 1052226 So, I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1059274 1061109 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
1065781 1067115 However, at this endeavor,
1067282 1072412 I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar<br />as I don't know what they look like.
1073664 1076542 But you do. Don't ya?
1076708 1078919 I know what they look like all right.
1079086 1082589 Good. So here's my agreement.
1082756 1086176 - You travel with me until we find them.<br />- Where we goin'?
1086343 1088971 I hear at least two of them<br />are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,
1089137 1091306 but I don't know where.
1091473 1095769 That means we visit every plantation<br />in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
1095936 1101191 And when we find them,<br />you point them out, and I kill them.
1102234 1105612 You do that, I agree<br />to give you your freedom,
1105779 1109908 $25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.
1110075 1113787 And, as if on cue,<br />here comes the sheriff.
1117624 1118876 [scoffs]
1121545 1127050 OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.
1129678 1134266 - [overlapping chatter]<br />- All right, folks, calm down.
1135309 1137019 Go about your business.
1137811 1140188 These jokers will be gone soon.
1142149 1147571 Now, why y'all wanna come<br />into my town and start trouble?
1147738 1150991 And scare all these nice people.
1152159 1154828 You ain't got nothing better to do
1154995 1158206 than to come into Bill Sharp's town
1158373 1160626 and show your ass?
1160792 1162633 - [metal springing noise]<br />- [sheriff screaming]
1162711 1165672 - [crowd gasping]<br />- [groaning]
1165839 1167215 [woman screams]
1168967 1172888 - What'd you just do to our sheriff?<br />- [groaning]
1174348 1176224 - [yelling]<br />- [shot echoing]
1176391 1177601 [woman gasps]
1177768 1179728 [crowd screaming]
1184191 1186526 Now you can get the marshal.
1188028 1190364 [man] Marshal! Marshal!
1190530 1192783 - Should we wait inside?<br />- Can we just leave?
1192950 1194159 After you.
1196620 1200832 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1200999 1203877 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1204044 1206213 I want two men,<br />two rifles up on this roof.
1206380 1208715 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
1208882 1211843 All the barrels aimed<br />at that front door.
1212010 1215013 Somebody get poor Bill<br />outta the goddamn street.
1216181 1218350 You in the saloon!
1218517 1221853 We got a hundred rifles aimed<br />at every way out of that buildin'.
1222562 1225732 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1226566 1229069 You and your nigger come out right now<br />with your hands over your head,
1229236 1231196 and I mean right now.
1232322 1235742 [Schultz] Is this the marshal<br />I have the pleasure of addressing?
1235909 1237703 Yes, it is.
1237869 1239955 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1240122 1242416 [Schultz]<br />Na wunderbar, marshal.
1242916 1246503 I have relieved myself of all weapons,
1246670 1249589 and just as you have instructed,
1249756 1252426 I am ready to step outside
1252592 1256680 with my hands raised above my head.
1257764 1260183 I trust as a representative
1260350 1263729 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America,
1263895 1269735 I shan't be shot down in the street<br />by either you or your deputies
1269901 1272738 before I've had my day in court.
1272904 1275240 You mean like you did our sheriff.
1275407 1277200 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
1277367 1279703 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1279870 1285542 Do I have your word as a lawman not to<br />shoot me down like a dog in the street?
1288879 1292132 Well, much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that,
1292299 1295302 ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1296344 1299306 Fair enough, marshal.<br />Here we come.
1301141 1303310 They're a little tense out there.
1303477 1306938 So don't make any quick movements,<br />and let me do the talking.
1307272 1309941 - [doors squeaking open]<br />- Come ahead.
1316990 1318241 You unarmed?
1318408 1320118 [Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.
1320869 1324206 Marshal Tatum, may I address you<br />and your deputies,
1324372 1326333 and apparently the<br />entire town of Daughtrey,
1326500 1328835 as to the incident that just occurred?
1330170 1332631 - Go on.<br />- Thank you.
1332798 1334925 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1335092 1338345 Like yourself, marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1338512 1341932 The man lying dead in the dirt,<br />who the good people of Daughtrey
1342099 1346186 saw fit to elect as their sheriff,<br />who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
1346353 1350941 is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck,
1351108 1353693 with a price on his head of $200.
1353860 1356822 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
1356988 1358323 The hell, you say!
1358490 1362536 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news.
1362702 1365872 But I'm willing to wager<br />this man was elected sheriff
1366039 1368542 sometime in the past two years?
1369459 1370460 Yeah.
1370627 1374047 [Schultz] I know this because three<br />years ago, he was rustling cattle
1374214 1377676 from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company<br />of Lubbock, Texas.
1377843 1381638 Now, this is a warrant<br />made out by
1381805 1387477 Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen<br />Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
1387644 1389354 You're encouraged to wire him.
1389521 1394568 He'll back up who I am and<br />who your dear departed sheriff was.
1394734 1398697 [guns uncocking]
1402742 1406663 In other words, marshal,<br />you owe me $200.
1406830 1409749 [medium-tempo song plays]
1415338 1416840 I'll be damned.
1444910 1448455 After this Brittle business<br />is behind us,
1448622 1454169 you'll be a free man, with a horse,<br />$75 in your back pocket...
1456963 1458381 What's your plan after that?
1460634 1464471 Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
1466723 1471603 Django, I had no idea<br />you were a married man.
1472103 1474397 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
1474564 1478151 Oh, me and my wife do.
1478318 1482489 Old Man Carrucan didn't.<br />That's why we, uh... we run off.
1483698 1485325 [man] Django.
1485992 1488578 Django, Django-
1488745 1491456 You got sand, Django.
1492165 1494042 Boy's got sand.
1495835 1498964 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1500674 1504177 I want you to burn a runaway "r"<br />right here on his cheek.
1504344 1505387 And the girl, too.
1505553 1507347 [groaning]
1507514 1512310 And I want you to take 'em to<br />the Greenville auction and sell 'em.
1513144 1515021 Both of 'em.
1515188 1516940 Separately.
1519401 1520735 And this one...
1523363 1526074 you will sell him cheap.
1528034 1529536 In Greenville...
1532080 1535041 there should be some sort<br />of a records office.
1542257 1544467 You know when she was sold...
1545927 1548888 you know where she came from,
1549055 1550890 and you know her name.
1551683 1553226 What is her name?
1553393 1555061 Broomhilda.
1556646 1559899 - What?<br />- Broom-hilda.
1560066 1562027 - Broomhilda?<br />- Hm-mm.
1564112 1567115 - Were her owners German?<br />- Yeah, how you know?
1567991 1569409 She wasn't born on<br />the Carrucan plantation.
1569576 1572120 She was raised by a German mistress,<br />the Von Shafts.
1572287 1574414 She speak a little German, too.
1574581 1576333 - Your wife?<br />- Hm-mm.
1576499 1578335 When she was little, her mistress<br />taught her so she'd have somebody
1578501 1580086 to speak German with.
1581671 1584257 Well, let me get this straight.
1584424 1589012 Your slave wife speaks German<br />and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
1589179 1590305 Yep.
1594351 1597103 They call me Hildi.
1605695 1607614 [rooster crowing nearby]
1613787 1619376 When we gain access to these<br />plantations, we'll be putting on an act.
1620710 1623463 You'll be playing a character.
1630345 1631471 Hm?
1632180 1633598 No?
1640605 1645068 During the act, you can<br />never break character.
1646152 1647695 Do you understand?
1648446 1650990 Yeah. Don't break character.
1653326 1657247 And your character<br />is that of The Valet.
1657997 1659499 What that is?
1660417 1662794 That's a fancy word for servant.
1662961 1664212 - Valet?<br />- Hm-mm.
1664379 1665547 [chuckles]
1665713 1670218 And now, Django, you may choose<br />your character's costume.
1672637 1674472 Youse gonna let me<br />pick out my own clothes?
1674639 1675598 But of course.
1675765 1679436 [medium-tempo song<br />resumes playing]
1704377 1705587 Whoa.
1709883 1713470 It's against the law for niggers<br />to ride horses in this territory.
1713636 1717015 This is my valet.<br />My valet does not walk.
1717182 1721060 - I said niggers on horses...<br />- [Schultz] His name is Django.
1721227 1724022 He's a free man.<br />He can ride what he pleases.
1724189 1727650 Not on my property.<br />Not around my niggers, he can't.
1728318 1733323 My good sir,<br />perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
1733490 1735950 Allow me to unring this bell.
1736117 1739954 My name is Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my valet, Django.
1740121 1742248 And these are our horses,<br />Tony and Fritz.
1742415 1744250 - [snorting]<br />- [women giggling]
1746085 1747462 Mr. Bennett?
1747629 1751841 I've been led to believe that you<br />are a gentleman and a businessman.
1752008 1755970 And it is for these attributes<br />we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee
1756137 1758056 to parley with you now.
1758890 1763186 I wish to purchase<br />one of your nigger gals.
1764729 1767815 You and your Jimmie<br />rode from Texas to Tennessee
1767982 1769776 to buy one of my nigger gals?
1769943 1771611 No appointment, no nothin'?
1771778 1773696 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1773863 1776282 Well, what if I was to say<br />I don't like you?
1776449 1778117 Or your fancy-pants nigger?
1778284 1780495 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
1780662 1782622 Now what you got to say about that?
1785959 1787877 Mr. Bennett.
1788044 1791297 If you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be,
1791464 1796636 I have 5,000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.
1798054 1799097 [chuckles softly]
1800848 1804310 Well, come on inside and get<br />yourself somethin' cool to drink.
1806312 1807397 Hm-mm.
1811067 1812151 [chuckles]
1818825 1820785 Oh, maybe while we discuss business,
1820952 1823496 you could provide one of<br />your loveliest black creatures
1823663 1826040 to escort Django here<br />around your magnificent grounds.
1826207 1828376 Oh, well, absolutely!<br />Uh, Betina.
1828543 1830295 - Yessir, Big Daddy?<br />- Uh...
1830461 1832338 What's your Jimmie's name again?
1832505 1834007 <i>'</i> Django.<br /><i>'</i> Django.
1834173 1836342 Betina, sugar, could you<br />take Django there
1836509 1839721 and take him around the grounds here<br />and show him all the pretty stuff.
1839887 1841180 As you please, Big Daddy.
1841347 1845268 Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,<br />Django is a free man.
1845435 1848771 He cannot be treated like a slave.<br />He... within the bounds of good taste,
1848938 1851441 he must be treated<br />as an extension of myself.
1851608 1854611 - Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?<br />- Yes'm?
1854777 1859407 Django isn't a slave.<br />Django is a free man, you understand?
1860742 1862910 You can't treat him like any<br />of the other niggers around here,
1863077 1865997 'cause he ain't like any of the<br />other niggers around here. You got it?
1866164 1869042 You want I should<br />treat him like white folks?
1869208 1872337 No. That's not what I said.
1872503 1875048 Then I don't know what you want,<br />Big Daddy.
1875548 1880053 Yes, I can see that. Uh...
1880219 1884682 What's the name of that peckerwood boy<br />from town that works with the glass?
1884849 1886809 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
1886976 1889729 - Oh, you mean Jerry.<br />- That's the boy's name. Jerry!
1889896 1891397 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
1891564 1894692 - Yes'm, Big Daddy.<br />- Well, that's it, then.
1894859 1897820 You just treat him like you would Jerry.
1898029 1901324 [playing medium-tempo tune]
1904786 1907497 That house we just left from<br />is The Big House.
1907664 1910583 Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.
1911751 1913920 That there is the pantry.
1914087 1917590 That's where Big Daddy<br />hang all his dead meat.
1917757 1919801 Po' little squirrels.
1921511 1923930 What you do for your massa?
1924097 1925898 Didn't you hear him tell you<br />I ain't no slave?
1926015 1928434 - So you really free?<br />- Yes, I's free.
1928601 1930937 You mean you wanna dress like that?
1932772 1935233 - Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.<br />- What you want?
1935400 1938486 I'm lookin' for three white men.<br />Three brothers. Overseers.
1938653 1940113 Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?
1940279 1942156 - Brittle?<br />- Yes, Brittle.
1942323 1946619 John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.
1946786 1948621 I don't know them.
1949205 1951040 They could be usin' a different name.
1951207 1953459 They woulda come to the plantation<br />this past year.
1953626 1956254 - You mean the Shaffers?<br />- Maybe.
1956421 1958548 - Three brothers?<br />- Uh-huh.
1958715 1960466 - They here?<br />- Uh-huh.
1960633 1962385 Could you point one of 'em out to me?
1962552 1964846 Well, one's over in that field.
1970810 1973646 [medium-tempo song plays]

1992457 1994625 [Django] Look, I told you<br />that I was one that made her do it.
1994792 1996419 You ready?
1996586 1998880 She didn't wanna run off with me. If<br />anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

2000590 2003551 Now, I been here long enough, you know<br />me, you know me a long time, now.

2094433 2097395 - [cracking]<br />- "...and the dread of ye
2097562 2099856 shall be on every beast<br />of the earth."'
2100022 2100982 [cracking]
2101148 2102525 Come here now, woman!
2102692 2105778 - You'd better give me that arm!<br />- [screaming]
2122962 2124714 OK, she's ready!
2126799 2129093 [whimpering]
2138811 2142815 And after this, we'll see<br />if you break eggs again.
2146235 2148154 John Brittle!
2168716 2171385 - You remember me?<br />- [metal springing noise]
2182313 2184690 I like the way you die, boy.
2190446 2192990 Goddamn son of a bitch!
2202041 2203834 [grunting]
2204460 2205878 [whip cracking]
2206587 2207672 [groaning]
2211050 2212510 - Keep it funny!<br />- [grunting]
2216389 2218099 [yelling]
2227149 2228734 [man groaning]
2238077 2239537 Y'all wanna see somethin'?
2240329 2241789 [cocking pistol]
2243040 2244709 No! [groans]

2254844 2256387 Who were they?
2257096 2260099 That's Big John,<br />and that's Lil Raj.
2260266 2261767 Where's Ellis?
2261934 2264270 He's the one hightailin' it<br />across that field right now.
2269108 2270609 - You sure that's him?<br />- Yeah.
2270776 2272695 - Positive?<br />- I don't know.
2272862 2275114 - You don't know if you're positive?<br />- I don't know what "positive" mean.
2275281 2276532 - It means you're sure.<br />- Yes.
2276699 2278993 - "Yes," what?<br />- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
2292214 2293799 I'm positive he dead.
2298846 2299847 Django!
2301640 2304060 Everybody calm down.
2304226 2306479 We mean no one else any harm.
2306645 2308189 Who are you two jokers?
2308355 2311358 I am Dr. King Schultz,<br />a legal representative
2311525 2314195 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America.
2314361 2318949 The man to my left is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2319116 2321077 In my pocket is a warrant,
2321243 2325331 signed by Circuit Court Judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,
2325498 2329376 for the arrest and capture,<br />dead or alive,
2329543 2334548 of John Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
2334715 2336801 They were goin' by the name Shaffer.
2338219 2342348 You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br />but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
2342515 2344183 These are wanted men.
2344350 2345810 The law wants 'em for murder.
2345976 2350106 Now, I reiterate, the warrant<br />states dead or alive,
2350272 2353567 so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight,
2353734 2357196 we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2358322 2362701 I realize passions are high,
2362868 2366914 but I must warn you,<br />the penalty for taking deadly force
2367081 2369521 against an officer of the court<br />in the performance of his duty
2369625 2373546 is you'll be hung by the neck<br />until you're dead.
2376423 2381303 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2383389 2384515 Gimme.
2401073 2402408 Satisfied?
2408914 2411208 May I have that back, please?
2416922 2419925 - Get off my land.<br />- Posthaste.
2420593 2425014 Load up the bodies as quickly as you can<br />and let's get outta here.
2428100 2430561 [Schultz whistling indistinctly]
2450873 2454376 Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.
2462259 2465638 [galloping hoofbeats]
2467473 2471769 - [dramatic choral music]<br />- [horses snorting, whinnying]
2479610 2482655 [men yelling, whooping]
2494416 2495668 Come on, men!
2497878 2501382 - [man 1] We're coming for you, nigger!<br />- [man 2] Hee-haw!
2510599 2515020 Now, unless they start shootin' first,<br />nobody shoot 'em.
2515187 2517398 That's way too simple for these jokers.
2518148 2520776 We're gonna whup that<br />nigger-lover to death.
2520943 2525990 And I'm gonna personally<br />strip and clip that garboon myself.
2529868 2531078 Damn.
2532413 2535040 I can't see fuckin' shit<br />outta this thing.
2535958 2537251 We ready or what?
2537418 2539795 [Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,<br />I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.
2539962 2542339 - [fabric ripping]<br />- Oh... Oh, shit.
2542506 2544717 I just made it worse.
2544883 2546927 Who made this goddamn shit?
2547094 2550055 - Willard's wife.<br />- Well, make your own goddamn masks!
2550222 2553809 Look, nobody's sayin'<br />they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
2553976 2556562 Well, if all I had to do<br />was cut a hole in a bag,
2556729 2558397 I coulda cut it better than this!
2558564 2561358 What about you, Robert?<br />Can you see?
2561525 2562735 Not too good.
2562901 2567239 I mean, if I don't move my head I can<br />see you pretty good, more or less.
2567406 2570909 But when I start ridin', the bag's<br />movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
2571076 2573162 - Shit.<br />- [man] Yeah.
2573704 2575372 I just made mine worse.
2576206 2577333 Oh, God.
2577499 2579043 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2579209 2582171 No, nobody brought an extra bag!
2582338 2583964 I'm just askin'.
2584131 2585924 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?
2586091 2587301 Oh, well, shitfire!
2587468 2590554 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,<br />that just defeats the purpose!
2590721 2592681 Well, I can't see<br />in this fuckin' thing!
2592848 2595559 I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing<br />and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!
2595726 2598145 Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!
2598312 2602107 Now, I watched my wife work all day<br />gettin' 30 bags together
2602274 2604276 for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,
2604443 2608197 and all I can hear is<br />criticize, criticize, criticize!
2608364 2611533 From now on, don't ask me<br />or mine for nothin'!
2612826 2615704 Now, look, let's not forget<br />why we're here.
2615871 2618957 We got a killer nigger<br />over that hill there!
2619124 2620459 And we gotta make a lesson out of him.
2620626 2624463 OK, I'm confused.<br />Are the bags on or off?
2624630 2629426 I think we all think<br />the bag was a nice idea.
2629593 2630552 - Yeah.<br />- [mumbling agreements]
2630719 2634807 But, not pointin' any fingers,<br />they coulda been done better.
2635766 2639478 So how 'bout no bags this time,
2639645 2644650 but next time we do the bags right<br />and then we go full regalia.
2644817 2646857 - I like that idea a lot.<br />- You get my vote, Robert.
2646985 2650322 Wait a minute!<br />I didn't say no bags.
2650489 2652491 But nobody can see.
2652658 2653742 So?
2653909 2655786 So it'd be nice to see.

2729860 2732029 - He's getting away.<br />- I got him.
2734072 2735532 [Schultz]<br />Big Daddy's getting away.
2735699 2736950 I got him.
2741413 2743916 - [slow-motion impact sound]<br />- [Big Daddy grunting]
2752216 2753258 Got him.
2758096 2761099 [chuckles] The kid's a natural.
2765771 2767439 [animal yipping nearby]
2771777 2775572 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2775739 2777991 Broomhilda is a German name.
2778158 2780869 If they named her,<br />it stands to reason they'd be German.
2781036 2783288 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2784081 2787042 Broomhilda is the name of a character
2787209 2791129 in the most popular<br />of all the German legends.
2791296 2793257 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2793423 2795133 Oh, yes, there is.
2801181 2804643 - Do you know it?<br />- Oh, every German knows that story.
2811066 2812442 Would you like me to tell you?
2813944 2819950 Well, Broomhilda was a princess.
2821785 2825872 She was a daughter of Wotan,<br />god of all gods.
2826915 2830127 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
2830294 2831545 What she do?
2832504 2833964 I can't exactly remember.
2834131 2836800 She disobeys him in some way.
2836967 2840137 So he puts her on top of the mountain.
2840804 2841930 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
2842097 2843348 It's a German legend,
2843515 2846310 there's always going to be<br />a mountain in there somewhere.
2846476 2850522 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon<br />there to guard the mountain.
2852190 2857279 And he surrounds her<br />in a circle of hellfire.
2858739 2863076 And there, Broomhilda shall remain.
2864369 2869666 Unless a hero arises<br />brave enough to save her.
2870751 2872336 Does a fella arise?
2872502 2875464 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,<br />he does.
2875631 2877674 A fella named Siegfried.
2878383 2879384 Does Siegfried save her?
2881553 2884181 Quite spectacularly so.
2885223 2889353 He scales the mountain,<br />because he's not afraid of it.
2890062 2894232 He slays the dragon,<br />because he's not afraid of him.
2894399 2896902 And he walks through hellfire...
2899237 2901615 because Broomhilda's worth it.
2905744 2907412 I know how he feel.
2908872 2911750 I think I'm just<br />starting to realize that.
2917255 2921426 Now, look, Django...
2924346 2928392 I don't doubt that one day<br />you'll save your lady love...
2929518 2933105 but I can't let you go to<br />Greenville in a good conscience.
2934147 2938610 A slave auction town in Mississippi<br />isn't the place for you to visit.
2938777 2941655 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
2944616 2946785 But let me ask you a question.
2954292 2956712 How do you like the<br />bounty hunting business?
2958213 2960549 Kill white folks<br />and they pay you for it?
2961383 2962718 What's not to like?
2962884 2965303 Now, I have to admit,<br />we make a good team.
2965470 2968306 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
2968473 2970559 Yeah, on that occasion<br />you were a tad overzealous,
2970726 2972686 but normally, that's a good thing.
2973478 2975689 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2975856 2977858 What you mean "partner up"?
2978024 2982320 You work with me through the winter<br />till the snow melts...
2983321 2985323 I give you a third of my bounties.
2986533 2990454 So we make some money this winter,<br />and when the snow melts,
2990620 2993540 I'll take you to Greenville myself
2993707 2996918 and we'll find<br />where they sent your wife.
3001173 3002924 Why you care what happen to me?
3004676 3006636 Why you care if I find my wife?
3006803 3008180 Frankly...
3009473 3012350 I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before.
3012517 3016354 And now that I have,<br />I feel vaguely responsible for you.
3017606 3021318 Plus, when a German meets a real life<br />Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
3023862 3026740 As a German, I'm obliged<br />to help you on your quest
3026907 3029534 to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
3036291 3039461 [medium-tempo song plays]
3158830 3159831 [man] You got her.
3166630 3171551 Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna<br />Shoot White Folks For Money"?
3171718 3174429 - His son's with him.<br />- Well, good.
3174596 3176181 He'll have a loved one with him.
3176348 3178850 Maybe even share a last word.
3180852 3182896 That's better than most of them get.
3183063 3185357 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3193531 3194866 Put down the rifle.
3197869 3199579 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3200372 3202707 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3206670 3208171 Read it aloud.
3209047 3210840 Consider that today's lesson.

3261391 3263309 Crazy Craig Koons.
3264310 3266563 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
3266730 3269607 If Smitty Bacall wanted<br />to start a farm at 22,
3269774 3271735 they would never have printed that.
3272444 3275864 But Smitty Bacall<br />wanted to rob stagecoaches
3276031 3278450 and he didn't mind<br />killing people to do it.
3279117 3282454 Do you want to save your wife<br />by doing what I do?
3283705 3285165 This is what I do.
3285331 3288877 I kill people and<br />sell their corpses for cash.
3289794 3293590 This corpse is worth $7,000.

3544299 3548720 He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br />plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.
3548886 3550221 Candyland?
3550388 3551472 Oh, so you've heard of it.
3551639 3553725 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
3553891 3556561 Well, apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3556728 3558396 - [sighs]<br />- ...and that's the repellant gentleman
3558563 3562108 who owns her. Let's just hope she<br />works in the house, not in the field.
3562275 3564402 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
3564569 3566571 She... she pretty.
3567238 3569157 And she talk good, too.
3570742 3572583 But when they tore her back up<br />and then they...
3573745 3575913 burned that runaway "r"<br />on her cheek...
3577332 3578499 they goddamned her.

3580418 3581961 - [sizzling]<br />- [screaming]
3583212 3584589 She ain't no field nigger<br />but she ain't good enough
3584756 3586758 for the house no more either.
3586924 3588217 They gonna try to<br />make her a comfort girl.
3588384 3590261 What's a comfort...? Oh.
3591179 3592472 Not while I got freedom.
3594057 3595850 Not while I got my gun.
3598936 3600646 So do we offer to buy her?
3603274 3604650 So...
3606235 3607904 say...
3610073 3613284 a man wants to buy a horse.
3613451 3615495 Needs to buy a horse.
3616454 3619415 He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />and he knocks on the farmer's door
3619582 3621250 and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
3621417 3623211 And do you know what the farmer says?
3623378 3625588 The farmer says no.
3627090 3632053 Well, I say fuck that farmer,<br />and I'm stealin' that horse.
3632220 3636349 Fair enough. But now you're a horse<br />thief, and they hang horse thieves.
3636516 3638717 Not to mention the horse<br />goes back to its original owner
3638810 3640436 because the horse is still his property.
3640603 3644482 We need her and we need a bill of sale.
3644649 3647249 Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,<br />then how we gonna get her?
3648027 3651614 May I offer an alternative<br />plan of action?
3651781 3653282 Go ahead.
3653449 3657995 So... the man walks up<br />to the farmer's farm,
3658162 3659705 he knocks on the farmer's door...
3660415 3665461 and asks not to buy the horse,<br />but the farm.
3665628 3669006 And makes an offer so ridiculous,
3669173 3671968 the farmer is forced to say yes.
3672844 3675596 - We gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br />- No, it's far too big.
3675763 3679016 But apparently this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3680476 3682520 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3682687 3683688 What?
3683855 3686691 Can you convincingly<br />masquerade as someone
3686858 3688526 who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
3688693 3689735 Why?

3726272 3729734 A black slaver is lower<br />than the head house nigger...
3730401 3732528 and, buddy,<br />that's pretty fuckin' low.
3733654 3735656 Then play him that way.

3756677 3759472 Thank you for your assistance<br />in creating the opportunity
3759639 3762433 - for this appointment.<br />- Nonsense, it's my job.

3778950 3781410 [Leo] Oh, Calvin's father and I<br />were about 11
3781577 3783371 when we went to<br />boarding school together.

3789961 3791712 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3792588 3794006 What did you say?
3794173 3796926 - I said...<br />- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3797468 3801889 Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3802056 3804058 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
3804225 3806018 [chuckles]<br />What civilized people aren't?
3806185 3808437 And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3808604 3811065 [speaks French]
3811232 3815236 He doesn't speak French. Don't speak<br />French to him, it'll embarrass him.

3934230 3937316 - [grunting]<br />- You either hit him or are you ain't?
3937483 3938776 [yelling]
3941862 3944115 [speaking foreign language]
3945324 3948411 - Big Fred, come on!<br />- [grunting]
3948577 3950121 [Calvin] Turn him around! Now...
3953916 3958254 [Calvin] Use your strength, boy!<br />Come on, now! Use your strength!
3958421 3960172 [man screaming]
3960339 3962133 [Calvin] There you go!
3963467 3965928 There you go! Look at that.
3967012 3969974 See, I told you to put<br />some more power in there.
3970141 3972184 Do what I told you, boy!
3972351 3973811 - There you go!<br />- [bones cracking]
3973978 3976272 - No!<br />- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!
3976439 3979483 Blind him black, boy!<br />Blind him black!
3979650 3981736 [man screaming]
3981902 3984405 - Oh, no, Luigi.<br />- [screaming]
3987616 3991537 - Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!<br />- [screaming]
3992163 3993330 Oh...
3993497 3996333 - [panting]<br />- [man continues screaming]
4000463 4001422 [playing pool]
4001589 4003716 [screaming continues]
4003883 4005176 Finish him.
4009472 4011223 Go on, boy, finish him!
4012933 4014185 [screaming halts]
4015728 4017438 [Moguy] That's why they<br />call him Big Fred.
4017605 4021025 - Worth every penny.<br />- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
4021192 4023402 Come on up, now, boy.<br />Get yourself a rest.
4023569 4026572 You did a fine job.<br />A real fine job.
4027198 4028908 Mercedes.
4050012 4051222 Tequila.
4061232 4062733 What's your name?
4064902 4066403 Django.
4068823 4070491 Can you spell it?
4072618 4076664 D-J-A-N-G-O.
4078165 4079667 The D is silent.
4079834 4081418 I know.
4088133 4089218 [speaks foreign language]
4089385 4092888 [Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to<br />take care of my new boy here.
4093055 4094765 You find him a room<br />with a soft bed,
4094932 4097518 then you bring him up<br />a pony to lick his pole.
4097685 4100485 But you be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
4100604 4101605 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
4101772 4105651 Before you go,<br />Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
4109488 4112491 You enjoy that, boy.<br />You've earned it.
4112658 4113951 Yessir.
4123460 4127256 - What's your name, boy?<br />- His name is Django Freeman.
4127423 4128632 [Calvin chuckles]
4130801 4132428 Where'd you dig him up?
4132595 4135848 A fortuitous turn of events<br />brought Django and myself together.
4137558 4139643 I've heard tell about you.
4140394 4143147 I heard you been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
4143314 4145441 Ain't nothin' nobody<br />is sellin' is worth buyin'.
4145608 4149820 I'm curious... what makes you<br />such a Mandingo expert?
4151780 4154199 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4157494 4159580 - What did you say, boy?<br />- Calm down, Butch.
4160623 4161957 No offense given...
4162791 4164001 none taken.
4164168 4165878 [Schultz] Monsieur Candie...
4166045 4169548 I'd appreciate if you could<br />direct your line of inquiry toward me.
4169715 4171175 One...
4171800 4174929 you do not have anything to drink.<br />Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
4175095 4177932 - Yes! I'll have a beer.<br />- Wunderbar.
4178098 4179934 Roscoe, a beer<br />for the man with the beard,
4180100 4181936 and I will have a<br />Polynesian Pearl Diver.
4182102 4184188 Do not spare the rum.
4184355 4187858 Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.
4188025 4189735 You are, well, you are a neophyte.
4189902 4195032 I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this<br />cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.
4196492 4199703 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...
4200412 4202289 I didn't seek you<br />out for your advice.
4202456 4204583 I sought you out to<br />purchase a fighting nigger
4204750 4207294 at above top-dollar market price.
4207461 4210005 Now I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience,
4210172 4212549 it would be to discuss business.
4215260 4217721 Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.
4217888 4220224 We were discussin' my curiosity.
4222518 4223519 Thank you.
4223686 4226397 [Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,<br />go outside and play.
4228399 4231860 Sheba... you stay right there.
4232027 4233570 I know you didn't mean me.
4235322 4237825 - Prost!<br />- German.
4238742 4242538 Now, according to Moguy,<br />if I do business with you,
4242705 4244748 I'm doing business with both y'all.
4244915 4247334 He does the eyeballin',<br />you the billfold? Is that it?
4247501 4251255 Well, you don't make it sound<br />too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
4251422 4252589 Hm.
4253882 4254883 So...
4255050 4256969 Bright Boy...
4257136 4259096 Moguy tells me<br />you looked over my African flesh
4259263 4261432 and you was<br />none too impressed, huh?
4261598 4263100 Not for top dollar.
4265269 4267312 Well, then,<br />we got nothin' more to talk about.
4267479 4269606 You see, you wanna buy<br />a beat-ass nigger from me,
4269773 4272026 those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell so...
4272192 4274153 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4275112 4278282 He wants the nigger<br />you don't wanna sell.
4278449 4282745 Well, I don't sell the niggers<br />I don't wanna sell.
4284997 4288667 Well, you won't sell your best.
4288834 4291253 You won't even sell your second best.
4291420 4295090 But your third best...?<br />You don't want to sell him either.
4295257 4299178 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4299970 4302014 [chortles]<br />...who knows what could happen?
4304349 4306643 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4307644 4311732 For a truly talented specimen,<br />the right nigger?
4313484 4315527 How much would you say, Django?
4318906 4320616 Twelve thousand dollars.
4321325 4322993 [straw slurping]
4325162 4329166 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,
4329333 4331251 but now you have my attention.
4344932 4350604 Willie. Willie.<br />Hold up! Hold up. Ah!
4350771 4353190 - Good morning, gentlemen.<br />- Good Dr. Schultz.
4353357 4357277 - Beautiful morning, isn't it?<br />- You couldn't have picked a better one.
4357444 4360322 Please, won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the Victoria.
4360489 4362032 [Schultz]<br />Oh, thank you very much.
4362199 4364326 You can tie your horse up back there.
4372543 4373836 [Calvin] Django.
4378632 4382261 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues
4382427 4387599 is I believe there is a level<br />above bright, above talented,
4387766 4391895 above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.
4392062 4396733 Say, one nigger that<br />just pops up in 10,000.
4396900 4398402 The exceptional nigger.
4399403 4401446 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
4402573 4403740 Sun is up.
4404908 4406785 Shining on all of us.
4411540 4414459 - [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.<br />- [Schultz] Thank you.
4414626 4415919 Quite an honor.
4416086 4417796 - The honor is all ours.<br />- Thank you.
4417963 4421341 <i>[Calvin] But I do believe that,<br />given time,</i>
4421508 4424469 exceptional niggers<br />like Bright Boy here...
4425429 4427264 become if not frequent...
4428515 4430142 more frequent.
4431894 4436481 Bright Boy,<br />you are that one in 10,000.
4436648 4439526 The name of the game is keep up,<br />not catch up, nigger.
4440110 4442196 [men laughing]
4452414 4453790 - Whoa!<br />- [whinnying]
4455292 4458712 - Touch your guns, you die.<br />- Everybody, calm down!
4458879 4460797 Now I saw the whole thing.<br />No harm done.
4460964 4462007 Are you kidding me?
4462174 4464176 - This nigger just...<br />- I said no harm done!
4464343 4466887 Now take your hand off your pistol!
4467971 4470766 Butch, that means you too.
4471975 4474978 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
4476480 4478690 Hoot! Get back up on your horse.
4479441 4480984 He broke my collarbone!
4481151 4485447 For God's sake, somebody please help<br />Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.
4485614 4488659 - [man] Yessir, boss.<br />- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
4490035 4491411 You better listen to your boss,<br />white boy.
4491578 4494039 Oh, I'm gonna go<br />walking in the moonlight with you.
4494206 4495999 You wanna hold my hand?
4496833 4498460 [chuckling]
4498627 4500629 [rap song playing]
4500796 4502422 [clucking]
4502589 4505259 Willie, take us home.
4507511 4509513 [man] Start moving!
4515894 4517145 Head 'em out!
4562774 4564375 You got a problem<br />with your eyeball, boy?
4564484 4565736 No, sir.
4565902 4567404 You want a boot heel in it?
4568613 4569573 No, sir.
4569740 4572784 Then you keep your<br />goddamn eyeballs off me.
4572951 4576079 You flash that bad look at me again,<br />I'll give you a reason not to like me.
4576246 4577789 Now move, nigger!
4578332 4579750 [horse snorting]
4579916 4582044 You niggers are gonna<br />understand something about me.
4582210 4584087 I'm worse than any of these<br />white men here.
4584254 4587841 You get the molasses out your ass,<br />you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
4588008 4591053 He is a rambunctious sort,<br />ain't he? [chuckles]
4591219 4592554 Indeed.
4595057 4598435 May we stop for a moment<br />so I may put a word in my man's ear?
4598602 4602314 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love<br />once I see the specimens at Candyland,
4602481 4605567 so before that moment,<br />it would be good if I could have
4605734 4610113 a confidential strategy meeting<br />with my confidant.
4613075 4614910 You mind telling me<br />what the hell you doing?
4615077 4617120 I confirmed that Broomhilda's<br />at Candyland.
4621166 4623752 - You're sure it's her?<br />- He didn't call her by name,
4623919 4627297 but she's a young lady, whip marks<br />on her back and speaks German.
4627464 4629341 Now, while it's not wise to assume,
4629508 4631968 in this instance,<br />I think it's pretty safe.
4632135 4636765 Point being, don't get so<br />carried away with your retribution.
4636932 4638892 You lose sight of why we're here.
4639059 4640860 - You think I lost sight of that?<br />- Yes, I do.
4641019 4643522 Stop antagonizing Candie.
4643688 4648652 You're going to blow this whole charade,<br />or more than likely get us both killed.
4648819 4653490 And I, for one, don't intend to die<br />in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.
4653657 4656660 I'm not antagonizing him.<br />I'm intriguing him.
4656827 4659371 You're yelling abuse<br />at these poor slaves.
4660372 4665794 I recall the man who had me<br />kill another man in front of his son
4665961 4667754 and he didn't bat a eye.
4669172 4670298 You remember that?
4672551 4673885 Yeah, of course I remember.
4674052 4677514 What you said was that<br />this is my world...
4678473 4680475 and in my world you gotta get dirty.
4681476 4684354 So that's what I'm doing.<br />I'm gettin' dirty.
4688024 4691194 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
4692654 4694739 that was the general gist.
4695240 4696408 [sighing]
4698493 4699995 See you at Candyland.
4707711 4710297 [Django]<br />All right, niggers, back at it.
4711590 4713633 That means you too, Moonlight.
4722476 4725103 [dogs barking nearby]
4750504 4752422 [dogs barking loudly]
4761014 4763892 [Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!
4764059 4767312 Now, boy, why do a<br />fool thing like run off?
4767479 4769564 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4769731 4771024 [Calvin] Yes, you can.
4771191 4774736 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4774903 4777322 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please<br />shut these goddamn dogs up?
4777489 4780116 - I cannot hear myself think!<br />- Quiet down, Marsha!
4780283 4782327 Marsha, hush up! Marsha!
4782494 4784037 Hush up! Hey!
4784204 4786831 Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4786998 4789251 [dogs whining]
4796341 4799803 Come on now, boy...<br />get on out that tree.
4799970 4801638 Yessir.
4802180 4803848 [dogs resume barking]
4808103 4809479 [barking stops]
4824202 4826329 How long was he loose?
4826496 4829749 [speech slurred]<br />A night. Day.
4829916 4831543 Half the other night.
4832669 4834212 How far he get off the property?
4834379 4836089 'Bout 20 miles off the prop.
4836256 4838383 Pretty far considering<br />that limp he got.
4838550 4839926 Hm.
4841177 4844514 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4844681 4846308 One-a this new lot.
4847475 4850186 Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian<br />wouldn't bet a bead on him.
4850353 4852856 [D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur<br />Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.
4853023 4854543 - Now, now, now, now, now.<br />- I can't...
4854691 4857110 Now, no beggin'.
4857277 4859738 No playin' on my soft heart.
4863199 4865744 - You in trouble now, son.<br />- Yessir.
4868663 4872208 I done paid $500 for you.
4872375 4877255 When I pay $500, then I expect<br />to get five fights out of a nigger
4877422 4879799 - 'fore he roll over and play dead.<br />- Sir.
4879966 4883845 You got to understand<br />that I'm runnin' a business here.
4884012 4886723 - You fought three fights.<br />- But I won every one.
4886890 4888391 Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
4888558 4891561 But that last one, you muddled the line<br />between winnin' and losin'.
4891728 4892771 Yessir.
4895440 4897484 Still, the fact remains:
4897651 4901279 I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
4901446 4903990 So what about my $500, huh?
4905867 4907786 What about my $500?
4909329 4910872 You gonna reimburse me?
4916878 4919255 You even know what "reimburse" means?
4919422 4921466 - [laughing]<br />- [Calvin] Huh?
4923259 4925762 [laughter continues]
4927764 4929474 I'll reimburse you!
4933228 4934437 You Will?
4935647 4937190 Yep.
4939943 4942654 You'll pay $500
4942821 4946282 for practically a one-eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4946449 4947575 No, he won't.
4949828 4951913 He just tired of you<br />toyin' with him is all.
4952831 4954791 Matter of fact, so am I.
4954958 4957419 But we ain't payin' a penny<br />for that pickaninny.
4957585 4959465 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4961131 4962340 You heard him.
4971516 4975270 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4975437 4979107 He ain't never seen a<br />nigger like you ever in his life.
4979899 4981860 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4984112 4985572 That right.
4986573 4987907 [Calvin] For that matter...
4989200 4990785 nor have I.
4996875 4998042 Now...
4999210 5002338 seein' as you won't pay a penny<br />for this pickaninny here...
5004841 5008178 you won't mind me handlin'<br />this nigger any way I see fit?
5009304 5010847 He's your nigger.
5014601 5016686 Mr. Stonesipher?
5017479 5021441 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5021608 5026404 - Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!<br />- [barks echoing]
5027864 5030074 Get 'im, get 'im!
5031117 5033620 - Yeah!<br />- Whoo!
5033787 5035205 Whoo-ee!
5040418 5043046 - [dogs snarling]<br />- [screaming]
5063566 5065610 Your boss looks a little<br />green around the gills
5065777 5067946 for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
5068112 5072742 Nah, he just ain't used to seein'<br />a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
5073326 5074619 Hm.
5075703 5077080 You are used to it?
5077247 5080208 I'm just a little more<br />used to Americans than he is.
5080375 5085088 - Hm.<br />- Now, Monsieur Candie...
5085255 5086881 whenever you're ready.
5087048 5090426 We rode five hours<br />so you could show off your stock.
5090593 5092220 Let's get to it.
5093429 5097809 'Cause as of now,<br />if he's an example, I ain't impressed.
5100019 5101437 Follow me.
5113908 5115743 [snarling]
5121583 5123001 [clucking]
5123167 5124377 [nickering]
5218721 5221432 Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.
5223059 5224435 Stand up straight, now!
5225603 5226896 Get up there.
5227063 5229649 Get up there, boy. Come on.
5229816 5231442 Give me a line! Give me a line!
5231609 5233695 Get in line there! Straighten up!
5291419 5292628 [indistinct chatter]
5293337 5294964 Hello! Stephen, my boy!
5295131 5297800 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Hello, my ass.
5297967 5300928 Who this nigger up on that nag?
5301095 5304432 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?<br />What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?
5304599 5306976 - You miss me, huh?<br />- Oh, yessir. [laughs]
5307143 5310688 I miss you like a hog miss slop!
5310855 5314776 - Like a baby miss mammy's titty.<br />- [all chuckling]
5314942 5318780 I miss you like I misses<br />a rock in my shoe.
5318946 5321032 [laughing]
5321199 5325661 Now, I axed you:<br />Who this nigger on that nag?
5325828 5327497 Hey, Snowball?
5328706 5332293 Wanna know my name or<br />the name of my horse, you ask me.
5332460 5335296 Just who the hell you callin'<br />"Snowball," horse boy?
5335463 5337223 I'll snatch your<br />black ass off that nag there
5337298 5338674 - and in the mud so fast...<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5338841 5340961 - ...make your head spin.<br />- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5341094 5345389 Let's keep it funny.<br />Django here's a free man.
5345556 5347934 - This nigger here?<br />- That nigger there.
5348101 5350353 Let me at least<br />introduce the two of you.
5350520 5354315 Django, this is another cheeky<br />black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
5354482 5357735 Stephen, this here's Django.<br />You two oughta hate each other.
5357902 5361906 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5362073 5365993 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5366160 5367537 And they are our guests, Stephen.
5367703 5371207 And you, you old decrepit bastard,<br />oughta show them every hospitality.
5371374 5373751 - You understand that?<br />- Yessir. Him I understand.
5373918 5375586 But I don't know why<br />I got to take lip off this nigger.
5375753 5378381 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5379382 5380883 Yessir. I understand.
5381050 5383511 Well, good.<br />They're spendin' the night.
5383678 5385805 Go up in the guest bedrooms<br />and get two ready.
5386973 5388641 He gonna stay in The Big House?
5388808 5391018 Stephen, he's a slaver.<br />It's different.
5391185 5393771 - In The Big House?<br />- Well, you got a problem with that?
5393938 5396232 Oh, no.<br />I ain't got no problem with it,
5396399 5398442 if you ain't got no problem<br />with burnin' the bed, the sheets,
5398609 5400945 the pillowcases, everything else when<br />this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
5401112 5403364 That is my problem!<br />They are mine to burn!
5403531 5405741 Now your problem right now<br />is makin' a good impression!
5405908 5407827 And I want you to start solvin'<br />that problem right now
5407994 5409620 and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5411747 5413666 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
5415126 5416294 Go on, now.
5417211 5419630 Can't believe you brought<br />a nigger to stay in The Big House.
5419797 5421132 Your daddy rollin' over<br />in his goddamned grave.
5421299 5424844 Man, the lip on him. Whoo!<br />He's gettin' worse and worse.
5425011 5426179 Now...
5426345 5431017 Where is my beautiful sister?!
5431184 5434270 There she is!<br />Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
5434437 5439483 Dr. Schultz, this attractive<br />Southern belle is my widowed sister.
5439650 5443654 Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5444906 5448284 May I present to you<br />Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
5448451 5451829 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.<br />Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
5451996 5454123 - Come on, Charly. Come on, now!<br />- Let's go.
5454290 5455333 You know where it is.
5455499 5457251 Like you on a rope!
5458461 5461214 Niggers don't walk around here,<br />niggers run!
5461923 5464926 - Monsieur Candie?<br />- Hm?
5465092 5468888 Yeah. About that matter about the<br />nigger girl you were talking about?
5469055 5470014 Nigger gal?
5470181 5473184 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5473351 5475937 Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?
5476103 5480274 Do you think before the demonstration,<br />you could send her around to my room?
5480441 5484612 [laughs] You little dickens, you.<br />I don't see why not.
5484779 5488157 Stephen, when you get through showin'<br />them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,
5488324 5490159 get her cleaned up<br />and smellin' real nice,
5490326 5491744 and sent over to<br />Dr. Schultz's room here.
5491911 5493579 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,
5493746 5496415 there's-a somethin'<br />I ain't told you 'bout yet.
5496624 5500294 - What?<br />- [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.
5501796 5503076 [Calvin] What's she doin' there?
5503130 5505883 [Stephen] What you think she<br />doin' there in the Hot Box?
5506050 5507510 She bein' punished.
5507677 5510012 - [Calvin] What she do?<br />- [Stephen] She run off again.
5510179 5512848 Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people<br />ran away while I was gone?
5513015 5515518 - Two.<br />- When did she go?
5515685 5518187 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5518354 5521023 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5521941 5525444 [Stephen] Lucky for her,<br />they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.
5525611 5529907 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,<br />found her, brung her back.
5530074 5532994 Now, she a little beat-up.<br />But she done that to her own damn self
5533160 5534370 runnin' through them<br />damn bushes and shit.
5534537 5536205 [Calvin]<br />How long she been in the box?
5536372 5539166 [Stephen] How long you think<br />she been in there? All damn day.
5539333 5542003 And the little bitch<br />got ten more days to be in there.
5542169 5545214 - Still, take her out.<br />- Take her out? Why?
5545381 5549302 Because I said so, that's why.<br />Dr. Schultz is my guest.
5549468 5550428 Hildi is my nigger.
5550594 5553764 Southern hospitality dictates<br />I make her available to him.
5553931 5557143 - But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.<br />- Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5557310 5559729 What is the point of havin'<br />a nigger that speaks German
5559895 5562356 if you can't wheel 'em out<br />when you have a German guest?
5562523 5566694 Now, I realize it is inconvenient,<br />but still, you take her ass out.
5566861 5568029 Yessir.
5569322 5571907 [Calvin] Lara Lee!<br />Will you and Cora be responsible
5572074 5575453 for gettin' Hildi cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
5575619 5576996 [Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.
5577163 5582043 Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am<br />weary from our travels beyond words.
5582209 5585087 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5587548 5589759 [clucking]
5589925 5592678 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up outta there!
5592845 5595389 Cora! Come here!
5595556 5598601 Get over there and get her cleaned up,<br />bring her back over here to Dr...
5598768 5601145 - What he say your name is? Shoots?<br />- Schultz.
5601312 5603773 Schultz. Get her back over here.<br />Hurry up, girl.
5603939 5607318 - Yessir.<br />- [soft guitar music plays]
5648192 5650069 [Hildi screams]
5650903 5653614 Come on, girl. Stand up.
5654824 5656200 [Hildi yelling]
5656367 5659912 [gasping screaming]
5661205 5663666 [sobbing]
5683644 5687189 Is you comin' with me or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?
5689900 5692570 [slow-tempo song plays]
5696115 5698742 [woman sings in foreign language]
5774443 5775611 [exhales]
5782368 5783827 Hello, ladies.
5783994 5787373 Dr. Schultz.<br />May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5791544 5794004 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
5795464 5797591 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
5798634 5800970 I've heard a lot of<br />good things about you.
5801136 5803931 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't ya know.
5804098 5806016 - [chuckles]<br />- [forced chuckle]
5807184 5809186 As I look at you now, Broomhilda,
5809353 5814316 I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5817653 5819989 The doctor here speaks German.
5821991 5823951 And I've been informed you do as well?
5825494 5827663 Go ahead, girl.<br />Speak a little German.
5829790 5833419 [Speaking German]
5834211 5835838 Ha! [laughs]
5836005 5838007 Astonishing.
5838173 5839842 [Speaking German]
5844972 5847182 - And I shall bring you...<br />- [Schultz] Much obliged.
5856692 5857818 <i>Ja.</i>
5878464 5880049 [speaks German]
5881216 5882676 Don't be afraid.
5920756 5923258 Hm. Pardon.
5930849 5932142 <i>Danke.</i>
5975978 5977604 [chuckling]
6020397 6022441 [repeats German phrase]
6037581 6039166 Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
6039750 6041335 [gasping]
6043754 6044922 [moaning]
6047758 6051053 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6052638 6053972 - Hurry up, girl.<br />- These ready, Miss Cora.
6054139 6055500 No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.
6055557 6058597 Go downstairs, get the big jug with the<br />red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
6058685 6061438 - Get your big pretty ass out the way.<br />- You know you like it.
6061605 6063816 [laughs] That's 'cause<br />you knows what I like.
6063982 6066568 Ooh!<br />Come on with these biscuits, girl.
6066735 6072533 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were<br />all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
6072699 6077079 But the best three by far were Samson...
6078455 6080056 - What's that other one's name?<br />- Goldie.
6080207 6083544 Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
6083710 6086296 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
6086463 6089550 [chuckles] You never know how<br />these nigger nicknames get started.
6089716 6092302 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold. Who knows?
6092469 6094471 [all laugh]
6095973 6101311 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.<br />We all know that.
6101478 6105190 You will never sell him,<br />and I can see why. He's a champion.
6105357 6109111 Hm-hm.<br />All three are champions.
6109778 6111864 Samson's the champion.
6112030 6113824 Them other two pretty good.
6115117 6116718 Calvin, now what's<br />this nigger you let...
6116785 6117911 It's all right.
6118078 6120163 You have to understand,<br />Monsieur Candie,
6120330 6123709 while admittedly a neophyte<br />in the nigger fight game,
6123876 6128171 I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6128338 6129423 Is that right?
6129590 6133677 Hence, I have big ideas<br />when it comes to presentation.
6133844 6134803 Hm.
6134970 6137431 I need something more<br />than just a big nigger.
6139182 6141393 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6141560 6144646 - Need to have what? What?<br />- Panache. Uh...
6144813 6147566 - A sense of Showmanship.<br />- Showmanship, yes.
6147733 6150944 I want to be able to bill him<br />as The Black Hercules.
6151111 6152738 [all chuckling]
6152905 6154385 The Black Hercules,<br />isn't that clever?
6154448 6155449 More like Nigger-les.
6155616 6157743 [laughing]
6157910 6163290 I said, and I quote:<br />"I would pay top dollar for...
6163790 6166585 'the right nigger."'
6166752 6171048 Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6171214 6173926 But is he right as rain?
6175177 6176595 Oh, Dr. Schultz,
6176762 6180557 I will have you know there<br />is no one in the nigger fight game
6180724 6182643 that appreciates<br />the value of showmanship
6182809 6184561 more than Monsieur<br />Calvin J. Candie here.
6184728 6185729 Nobody.
6185896 6187776 But one must not forget<br />the most important thing
6187898 6189298 - in the nigger fight game.<br />- Hm-mm.
6189441 6191443 And that is a nigger<br />that can win fights.
6191610 6192819 Hm-mm.
6192986 6197199 Now that should be your first, second,<br />third, fourth, and fifth concern.
6197366 6199446 Now, after you have that,<br />and you know you have that,
6199576 6203538 then you can start<br />to implement a grand design.
6203705 6206249 In other words, first thing is first.
6206416 6207876 First thing's first.
6212714 6214341 [whispers in German]
6215550 6218929 Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.
6219096 6220973 Famously.
6221723 6224393 Oh, Monsieur Candie,<br />you can't imagine what it's like
6224559 6227896 not to hear your<br />native tongue in four years.
6228063 6229943 Well, hell,<br />I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
6230065 6232150 [laughing]
6232317 6234361 Two weeks in Boston!
6234528 6237322 - Monsieur Candie, you a mess!<br />- [coughing]
6237489 6239199 [Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!
6239366 6244579 I can't express the joy I felt<br />conversing in my mother tongue.
6244746 6248834 And Hildi is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6249001 6250877 [Calvin] Well, be careful now,<br />Dr. Schultz.
6251044 6252379 You might-a caught yourself
6252546 6253797 - a little dose of nigger love.<br />- Hm!
6253964 6256049 [Calvin] Nigger love's<br />a powerful emotion, boy.
6256216 6258218 - [Stephen] Hm!<br />- It's like a pool of black tar.
6258385 6260012 Once it catches your ass, you're caught.
6260178 6263140 Yessir, you stuck. [laughs]
6263306 6264850 [Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.
6265017 6267269 You can lay on all the<br />German sweet talk you want,
6267436 6271940 but it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6273066 6274192 [Lara Lee giggles]
6274359 6276820 Well, naturally.
6276987 6280615 It is the soaring eagle<br />that attracts her attention,
6280782 6283577 - not the plucked chicken.<br />- [all chuckle]
6283744 6286246 [Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be<br />so down on yourself.
6286413 6288331 You are quite the dapper<br />European gentleman.
6288498 6289541 [Cora] You got to clean these dishes,
6289708 6291869 you got to put your elbow<br />in these dishes, you hear me?
6291877 6294087 You know that nigger, don't you?
6295005 6296298 - Who?<br />- "Who?"
6296465 6299551 Don't "who" me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talkin' about.
6301303 6303305 At the table?
6303472 6304723 I don't know him.
6304890 6307934 - You don't know him.<br />- No.
6308101 6310937 - "No," what?<br />- No, sir.
6313023 6314107 [chuckles]
6315567 6318028 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
6322240 6323450 OK.
6324701 6327829 Yeah. If you say so.
6334294 6337714 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br />no doubt about it.
6339091 6344262 But if it was my money,<br />I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.
6344429 6346765 What would your price be?
6346932 6348892 Well, if I was inclined<br />to be generous...
6349059 6352521 and I don't know why<br />I would be inclined to be generous...
6353480 6356733 9,000. Maybe.
6357984 6363782 Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how<br />this whole negotiation came about.
6363949 6366118 You see, it wasn't me<br />who came to you to sell a nigger.
6366284 6367244 Sure wasn't.
6367410 6369121 It was you who approached me to buy one.
6369287 6371456 - Sure was.<br />- Now, that $9,000 figure
6371623 6374042 Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,<br />that ain't too far off from right.
6374209 6375929 And if I wanted to sell<br />Eskimo Joe for that,
6376002 6378964 - I could do so any day of the week.<br />- Any day.
6379131 6383385 But, like you said in Greenville,<br />doctor... I don't want to sell him.
6384010 6388014 It was only your ridiculous<br />offer of $12,000
6388181 6391017 - that made me even consider it.<br />- Hm-mm.
6395689 6399025 [deep inhale]
6399192 6403280 You know, Monsieur Candie,<br />you do possess the power of persuasion.
6403446 6404739 [chuckles]
6407200 6409619 [slamming table] Why not?<br />Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
6409786 6413123 - Eskimo Joe, $12,000.<br />- [banging table] Hooray, doctor.
6413290 6415417 Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6415584 6419129 However, that is<br />a tremendous amount of money.
6419296 6422465 And the way you have<br />your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.
6422632 6424426 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6424593 6427679 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract
6427846 6430891 before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6431057 6432058 Hm-mm.
6432225 6433894 Not to mention having<br />Eskimo Joe examined
6434060 6436688 - by a physician of my choosing.<br />- [Calvin] Naturally.
6436855 6441568 So, say I return in about...
6443737 6446031 - ...five days time.<br />- Five days?
6446198 6447449 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6447616 6449659 And then my Mr. Tuttle<br />and your Mr. Moguy
6449826 6452787 can hash out the finer<br />details between themselves.
6453622 6456666 I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
6457417 6458585 Gentlemen...
6459586 6461588 may I propose a toast.
6463965 6468845 To Eskimo Joe.<br />Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?
6469012 6471681 - [all chuckling]<br />- To The Black Hercules.
6471848 6473225 [Stephen] The Black Hercules.
6473391 6474809 [speaks low]<br />To The Black Hercules.
6474976 6478813 You was right, doctor.<br />That name do have pan-ass. [chuckles]
6478980 6480398 Hm.
6480565 6483818 Hildi, top my drink off.
6486905 6491952 So, Hildi, how you like servin'<br />at the big table in The Big House, huh?
6492118 6495330 When Monsieur Candie talk to you,<br />you answers.
6495497 6498250 - I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.<br />- Hm-mm.
6498416 6501169 It's a lot better than sizzlin'<br />in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass
6501336 6502671 through a bramble bush.
6502837 6505958 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as<br />gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,
6506091 6507676 - huh, sugar bear?<br />- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.
6507842 6509010 - Sure do.<br />- Like Samson? Huh?
6509177 6510637 [Hildi] No, sir.
6510804 6512138 You know, Monsieur Candie,
6512305 6515976 the doctor here might be interested<br />in seein' Hildi's peeled back,
6516142 6519396 seein' as how they don't have<br />many niggers where he come from.
6519562 6521690 Dr. Schultz,<br />when you was alone with Hildi, here,
6521856 6524901 did you just speak German<br />or did you get to take her clothes off?
6525068 6526820 No, we just talked and...
6526987 6529364 [Calvin] Oh, so you<br />haven't seen her back?
6529531 6531324 - I haven't...<br />- No, no, no, no.
6531491 6533535 Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6533702 6536788 Hildi, go on, take off your dress.<br />Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
6536955 6538915 - Go on.<br />- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.
6539082 6541459 I just got her all dressed up<br />and lookin' nice.
6541626 6544546 [Calvin] But, Lara Lee,<br />Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.
6544713 6547716 They don't got niggers there.<br />He is a man of medicine.
6547882 6550468 I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br />the niggers' endurance for pain.
6550635 6554222 These niggers are tough,<br />Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
6554389 6556558 Hildi's got somethin'<br />like four lashes on her back.
6556725 6558725 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6558852 6559936 - [Stephen] Sure would.<br />- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.
6560103 6562355 - It's like a paintin'. Look at that.<br />- Calvin!
6563148 6566192 We are eating. Ain't no one wanna<br />look at her whipped up back.
6567861 6570280 - [exhales]<br />- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.
6570447 6573116 After dinner, then, Stephen.<br />After dinner.
6574326 6576119 During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?
6582500 6584044 [Lara Lee]<br />Cora, come get this girl!
6584210 6585879 [approaching footsteps]
6587505 6590717 - [Lara Lee] She a mess.<br />- Yes, ma'am. [gasps] Oh!
6590884 6593345 Why are you all undone?<br />I just got you done up.
6593511 6594846 Come on in here.
6601353 6605148 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,<br />and you need to be on his blind side.
6605315 6607275 You say you ain't know him.
6608401 6609486 Huh?
6609652 6615241 I said, you said you ain't know him.
6616409 6619788 - I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6621956 6623583 Mr. Stephen...
6624584 6625585 I don't.
6625752 6628254 Why is you lying to me?
6630632 6631966 I ain't.
6632133 6634636 Then why is you crying?
6634803 6636971 You scarin' me.
6637138 6641059 - Why is I'm scaring you?<br />- Because you scary.
6642727 6645814 [Schultz] To speak German<br />this afternoon with Hildi
6645980 6649109 was positively soul-enriching.
6649275 6652153 [Calvin] Doctor,<br />that warms my heart to hear that.
6652320 6655156 You stay right here.
6660495 6664999 [Schultz] You indicated earlier<br />you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
6665166 6668002 Why, yes.<br />Yessiree bob, I did.
6670004 6675969 In that case, allow me<br />to propose another proposition.
6676136 6677512 I'm all ears.
6677679 6679389 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6680014 6681599 - Monsieur Candie...<br />- [Calvin] Stephen!
6682642 6685103 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
6686229 6688356 [Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
6688523 6691234 My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
6691401 6692527 Excuse him.
6692694 6696448 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6696614 6698533 You mean get up out of my chair?
6698700 6702036 - If'n you could manage it.<br />- Why?
6702203 6706040 - It's about dessert.<br />- What about dessert?
6706207 6708835 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6709002 6710879 We're having white cake!
6711045 6713381 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing back there?
6713548 6717886 You right, Monsieur Candie.<br />You right. I'll handle it myself.
6718052 6719846 [whispers] Meet me in the library.
6720013 6723099 I just can't understand why you<br />won't come talk to these niggers.
6723266 6725143 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6725310 6730315 Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,<br />I will be along momentarily.
6730482 6731649 Yessir.
6732567 6736237 Well, gentlemen, as you can see,
6736404 6738245 talented as they are,<br />no doubt, in the kitchen,
6738323 6741951 from time to time,<br />adult supervision is required.
6742118 6743411 [all chuckle]
6744954 6746748 If you'll excuse me a moment.
6752921 6754714 [Calvin] You may clear<br />the dinner service.
6756174 6759552 [Cora] You heard him. Go on!<br />Get! Hurry up, girl.
6759719 6765141 So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you<br />regale us with a tale of the circus.
6765308 6767977 [chuckles] The circus?
6768144 6769646 [fire crackling]
6774442 6776236 What is the matter?
6781491 6786579 Them motherfuckers<br />ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
6786746 6790291 - They wants that girl.<br />- [chuckling]
6790458 6793211 Stephen, what the hell<br />are you talking about? Hm?
6793378 6796548 They playing your ass for a fool<br />is what I'm talking about.
6796714 6800385 They ain't here for<br />no musclebound Jimmie.
6800552 6802720 They here for that girl.
6802887 6805515 Wh... What girl? Hildi?
6805682 6809310 Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,<br />them niggers know each other.
6811020 6812605 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
6812772 6815149 - Did he give you any money?<br />- No! Not yet. But...
6815316 6817777 Then he ain't bought diddly.<br />Not yet, nohow.
6817944 6820196 But he's just about to buy
6820363 6823575 who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6823741 6826744 "Thank you, Stephen."<br />You're welcome, Calvin.
6832166 6834168 Where you gettin' all this?
6835295 6837088 Why would they go through<br />all that trouble for a nigger
6837255 6839757 with a chewed up back,<br />ain't worth $300?
6839924 6844220 They doin' it 'cause that nigger<br />Django's in love with Hildi.
6844387 6846222 She probably his wife.
6846389 6849183 Now, why that German gives a fuck<br />who that uppity son of a bitch
6849350 6852437 is in love with,<br />I'm sure I don't know.
6855023 6856983 If she's who they want...
6857567 6861863 why this whole snake oil pitch<br />about Mandingos, then?
6862030 6865533 You wouldn't pay no<br />never mind to no $300.
6865700 6871164 But that 12,000? That made you<br />real friendly, now, didn't it?
6873875 6875543 Yes, it did.
6878880 6880506 His wife, huh?
6884385 6888097 If it had been a snake,<br />it would have bit me.
6888264 6889682 [chuckles]
6891392 6893394 Those lying...
6894228 6900234 goddamn time-wastin'<br />sons of bitches.
6902445 6903613 Sons of bitches!
6904238 6909035 Out of New Orleans, so I have quite<br />a bit of practice with theater types.
6910286 6911746 Oh, there you are.
6911913 6914707 I was beginning to think that you<br />and that old crow run off together.
6914874 6916334 [all chuckling]
6916501 6918670 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
6918836 6921923 Lara Lee, I was just<br />looking out the big window.
6922090 6925134 Billy Crash is out there<br />dealing with some shady slaver
6925301 6926386 trying to sell a passel of ponies.
6926552 6930431 Would you be a dear, go out there<br />and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?
6930598 6932850 - Of course, brother.<br />- Thank you, darling.
6946114 6949826 - Yeah. Business never sleeps.<br />- Hm-mm.
6951869 6954789 Apropos, before your exit,
6954956 6958960 we were discussing the possibility<br />of my purchasing Broomhilda.
6959127 6962046 Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
6962213 6964340 And we will again. In a moment.
6980815 6982859 Who's your little friend?
6985236 6986279 [clearing throat]
6987822 6989323 This is Ben.
6990658 6995663 He's a old Joe that<br />lived around here for a long time.
6995830 6998249 And I do mean a long damn time.
6999333 7003087 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
7003963 7006007 and my daddy's daddy.
7006174 7008760 Till he up and keeled over one day...
7011596 7013264 Old Ben took care of me.
7015850 7019645 Growing up the son of a huge<br />plantation owner in Mississippi
7019812 7025693 puts a white man in contact<br />with a whole lotta black faces.
7027320 7032617 I spent my whole life here,<br />right here in Candyland...
7033868 7037663 surrounded by black faces.
7039707 7042043 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out,
7042210 7045379 I only had one question:
7049091 7051552 - Why don't they kill us?<br />- [laughs]
7054555 7059727 Now, right out there on that porch,<br />three times a week for 50 years,
7059894 7064816 Old Ben here would<br />shave my daddy with a straight razor.
7064982 7070112 Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda<br />cut my daddy's goddamn throat
7070279 7073699 and it wouldn't have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7076244 7077745 But he never did.
7079622 7080915 Why not?
7082291 7087088 You see, the science of phrenology
7087255 7092343 is crucial to understanding<br />the separation of our two species.
7094178 7097890 In the skull of the African here,
7098057 7100184 the area associated<br />with submissiveness
7100351 7105857 is larger than any human or any other<br />subhuman species on planet Earth.
7106941 7108609 [sawing]
7121372 7123332 If you examine...
7124709 7126878 this piece of skull here...
7133175 7136762 you will notice<br />three distinct dimples.
7140349 7144061 Here, here and here.
7144228 7145479 Now...
7145646 7150651 if I was holding the skull<br />of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,
7150818 7153321 these three dimples would be<br />found in the area of the skull
7153487 7156824 most associated with... creativity.
7157491 7159327 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
7159952 7162079 And in the skull of Old Ben,
7162246 7164540 unburdened by genius,
7164707 7168878 these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7170004 7171339 servility.
7172340 7174091 Now, Bright Boy...
7175009 7177178 I will admit you are pretty clever.
7179639 7181724 But if I took this hammer here...
7183851 7186187 and I bashed in your skull with it...
7187188 7192526 you would have the same<br />three dimples in the same place...
7193778 7195237 as Old Ben.
7196364 7199951 Hey! Now lay your palms<br />flat on that tabletop!
7200117 7203079 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop,
7203245 7206499 Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7207583 7210711 There have been a lot of lies said<br />around this dinner table here tonight,
7210878 7213214 but that you can believe!
7213381 7216175 Mr. Moguy, would you be<br />so kind as to collect the pistol
7216342 7218719 hanging off these boys' hips here?
7223432 7225851 - Thank you ever so much.<br />- Doctor.
7230398 7231774 Where were we?
7236237 7237655 Jackass.
7241659 7243160 Ah, yes.
7243327 7246080 I do believe you were<br />just getting ready to make me
7246247 7248708 a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
7248874 7250251 Am I right?
7254255 7255589 Right.
7258009 7259510 Bring out Hildi!
7262263 7263806 Get over there yonder.
7265266 7267518 - [screams]<br />- Sit your ass in that goddamn...
7267685 7268936 [Stephen] Lay your hand<br />flat on that tabletop.
7269103 7270646 [Calvin] Now shut your mouth!
7274942 7277528 Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,
7277695 7280448 you yourself said that<br />for the right nigger
7280614 7284952 you'd be willin' to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7285119 7288164 To which me myself said,<br />"What is your definition of ridiculous?"
7288330 7292293 To which you said, "$12,000."
7293085 7294837 - [yells]<br />- Now, considering y'all
7295004 7296964 have ridden a whole lot of miles,
7297131 7301093 went through a whole lot of trouble,<br />and done spread a whole lot of bull
7301260 7303679 to purchase this<br />lovely lady right here,
7303846 7309810 it would appear that Broomhilda is,<br />in fact... the right nigger.
7309977 7313731 And if y'all want to leave<br />Candyland with Broomhilda,
7313898 7319528 the price is $12,000.
7319695 7323491 And I take it you prefer the "take it<br />or leave it" style of negotiation?
7325743 7327286 Yes, I do, doctor.
7328120 7331123 You see,<br />under the laws of Chickasaw County,
7331290 7334835 Broomhilda here is my property.
7335002 7340132 And I can choose to do with<br />my property whatever I so desire!
7341217 7343511 And if y'all think my price...
7344178 7346889 for this nigger here<br />is too steep...
7347056 7350518 - [grunts]<br />- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...
7354438 7357566 take this goddamn hammer here<br />and beat her ass to death with it!
7357733 7359860 - Right in front of both y'all!<br />- Easy, big fella.
7360027 7364532 Then we can examine the three dimples<br />inside Broomhilda's skull!
7364698 7368869 Now, what's it gonna be, doc?<br />Huh?
7369036 7370371 - [Hildi whimpering]<br />- What's it gonna be?
7370538 7374416 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7375626 7376961 Yes, you may.
7390724 7391934 That 12.
7395980 7397857 - Sold!<br />- [screaming]
7398023 7400568 To the man with the exceptional beard
7400734 7404071 and his unexceptional nigger.
7409910 7412204 - Mr. Moguy.<br />- Yes, Calvin?
7412371 7416041 Will you make these gentlemen<br />a receipt for $12,000, please?
7416208 7417960 $12,000.
7421088 7423257 It was a pleasure doing<br />business with y'all.
7424133 7425885 Now, gentlemen...
7427094 7428971 if you care to<br />join me in the parlor...
7429930 7432391 we will be serving white cake.
7433267 7434894 [Beethoven's "Fur Elise"<br />played on harp]
7492201 7493401 - [screaming]<br />- [dogs snarling]
7508259 7509718 [screaming]
7520729 7522064 Well done, Calvin.
7524566 7527444 Excuse me.<br />Excuse me, ma'am?
7528904 7532574 Could you please stop playing Beethoven?<br />Take your hands off the harp!
7536829 7537913 [Stephen] Doctor!
7538080 7540708 - Doctor, you can't go in there!<br />- Stephen, Stephen.
7540874 7542042 He ain't got no business<br />going in there.
7542209 7543544 Let it be.
7543711 7545629 He's just a little upset, that's all.
7545796 7547214 I'll handle this.
7573073 7574366 White cake?
7575367 7577619 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
7578662 7579872 Hm.
7584626 7585627 [Calvin chuckles softly]
7587588 7590299 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you, huh?
7591008 7595763 Actually, I was thinking of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7595929 7597765 D'Artagnan.
7598557 7602353 And I was wondering what<br />Dumas would make of all this.
7602519 7603979 Come again?
7607066 7611111 Alexandre Dumas.<br />He wrote The <i>Three</i> Musketeers.
7611278 7612946 Yes, of course, doctor.
7613113 7614656 I figured you must be an admirer.
7614823 7619244 You named your slave<br />after his novel's lead character.
7619411 7623123 Now, if Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today,
7623290 7625250 I wonder what<br />he would have made of it.
7627294 7629129 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
7631340 7636512 Yes. His approval would be<br />a dubious proposition at best.
7638806 7640599 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
7642476 7644686 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7648524 7651318 - Are these Broomhilda's papers?<br />- Yes, they are.
7651485 7653153 - May I?<br />- Of course.
7653320 7654696 Thank you.
7656824 7659785 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history,
7659952 7662121 and, of course,<br />her freedom papers, doctor.
7662287 7664498 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7665749 7668669 - Right over there on that little table.<br />- Thank you.
7689982 7691191 Thank you.
7694778 7697072 Broomhilda Von Shaft...
7699324 7701702 consider yourself a free woman.
7713630 7715591 Mr. Candie...
7717551 7721346 normally,<br />I would say auf Wiedersehen.
7721513 7725976 But since what auf Wiedersehen actually<br />means is "till I see you again"
7726143 7728479 and since I never<br />wish to see you again,
7728645 7733317 to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."
7737196 7738489 Let's go.
7739448 7740991 Come on.
7742701 7744786 One more moment, doctor!
7746663 7747706 What?
7752419 7754546 It's a custom here in the South...
7755047 7760427 once a business deal is concluded<br />that the two parties shake hands.
7761261 7763305 It implies good faith.
7763472 7766517 - I'm not from the South.<br />- But you are...
7766683 7768977 in my house, doctor.
7769853 7772773 - So I'm afraid I must insist.<br />- Insist?
7772940 7774942 On what?<br />That I shake your hand?
7775108 7778403 Oh, then I'm afraid<br />I must insist in the opposite direction.
7779029 7782032 - You know what I think you are?<br />- What you think I am?
7782199 7783992 No, I don't.
7785661 7790874 - I think you are a bad loser.<br />- And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7791041 7796004 Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw<br />County, a deal ain't done
7796171 7798799 until the two parties<br />have shook hands.
7799675 7802511 Even after all that paper signin',<br />don't mean shit...
7803470 7806974 you don't shake my hand.
7807933 7813605 If I don't shake your hand,<br />you're gonna throw away $12,000?
7813772 7815524 I don't think so.
7816525 7817693 Mr. Pooch?
7819528 7824241 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand,
7824408 7826159 you cut her ass down.
7829079 7830414 [cocking shotgun]
7848181 7851518 You really want me to shake your hand?
7853186 7854771 I insist.
7855856 7858525 If you insist.
7860861 7862070 [metal springing noise]
7875125 7878128 No! Calvin!
7879212 7880797 Calvin!
7880964 7883300 [slow heartbeat rhythm]
7887137 7889640 I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
7892476 7894227 [sobbing]
7901902 7904071 Ni99er's gone crazy! Help!
7904237 7906031 - [screaming]<br />- Help, he's killing everyone!

7938105 7939648 What...? Fucking...
7939815 7941441 Goddamn it!
7942776 7945070 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- [screams]
7945237 7947197 You shot me!
7947364 7950450 - You stupid son of a bitch!<br />- [man] Sorry, Jessie!
7950617 7954746 Who the fuck gave a nigger<br />a goddamn gun?
7966675 7968176 [whimpering]
7971513 7973014 [screaming]
7978437 7981106 [yelling]
7984776 7985902 [man] Aim low!
7988238 7990073 Nigger! Gonna kill...!
7991032 7993201 [screams] God! Oh, my God!

7995495 7997330 [slow-motion gunshot]
8001752 8003754 [rap song playing]
8004171 8005338 Shit!
8006548 8007424 [screaming]
8062312 8063396 Shit.
8063563 8064606 [door squeaks open]
8073323 8075408 [overlapping gunshots]
8075575 8076993 [Stephen] Hold your fire!
8080413 8081915 Hold your fire!
8083834 8085710 Stop shootin', goddamn it!
8086711 8088046 [gunfire stops]
8094511 8095846 Django!
8096012 8097264 What?
8100475 8102102 We got your woman!
8103520 8106022 Billy Crash here got his pistol<br />upside her head.
8106189 8108775 - [gasping]<br />- You don't stop all that carrying on,
8108942 8111987 - he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.<br />- [gasping]
8112153 8116116 And that ain't no threat, horse boy.<br />That there is a promise.
8117742 8118952 Or...
8119119 8122122 you can give up,<br />throw your gun out...
8123248 8125417 - ...we won't kill Hildi.<br />- Horseshit!
8125584 8129296 Honest lnjun, Django.<br />I swear 'fore God.
8130380 8135010 You give up,<br />ain't no harm gonna come to her.
8136469 8138889 And I'm supposed to believe<br />your black ass?
8139055 8141766 Personally, I don't give a good goddamn<br />what you believe or don't believe!
8141933 8144978 I believe if you don't<br />give up in the next ten seconds,
8145145 8149024 we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!<br />Believe that!
8151276 8155030 Don't do it. [sniffling]<br />You give me up.
8155196 8157032 - [Stephen] Six!<br />- Just let me go.
8157198 8158742 - Seven!<br />- They got too much.
8158909 8160493 - [Hildi] Django.<br />- [Stephen] Eight!
8160660 8163163 - I love you.<br />- Nine!

8167417 8168501 <i>L</i> give UP-
8169711 8172464 I can't hear you, nigger.
8172631 8175133 I said I give up!

8198239 8200784 No! [sobbing]

8270603 8273606 [door opening]
8273773 8276109 [spurs clinking]
8294669 8297255 Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.
8302552 8304679 So y'all bounty hunters, huh?
8305638 8308391 I knew there was something<br />fishy about y'all.
8309392 8311603 We found your wanted posters...
8312187 8314397 and book of figures<br />in your saddlebags.
8315815 8317442 I got to say...
8318151 8321446 I ain't never heard of<br />no black bounty hunter before.
8321613 8324657 Black boy paid to kill white men?<br />How'd you like that line of work?
8325700 8328328 Probably pretty good while it lasted,<br />huh?
8330371 8331831 [sizzling]
8334501 8336419 [Django yells, muffled]
8336586 8337629 [grunting]
8337796 8339631 Time to say good night<br />to them nuts, blackie.
8339798 8342467 - [yelling]<br />- On three. One...
8342634 8345512 - [screaming]<br />- I got you. Two...
8345678 8348890 - [screaming]<br />- Calm down, now, here it comes.
8349057 8351643 - [screaming]<br />" [Stephen] Captain?
8351810 8353561 Miss Lara want to see you.
8354395 8358316 Something to do<br />with the Old Man's funeral.
8358483 8362278 Oh, and she changed her mind<br />'bout snipping Django.
8363071 8365907 She gonna give him<br />to the LeQuint Dickey people.
8366074 8367575 [Django moaning]
8367742 8369869 Well, she didn't<br />waste a minute telling me.
8377127 8378920 How disappointing.
8385426 8387220 [hissing]
8387387 8388721 [chuckles]
8401860 8403194 [Stephen] You leavin'.
8404863 8407907 This here what you take with you.
8411286 8414747 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at The Big House
8414914 8418334 could talk about<br />for the last few hours.
8418501 8422213 Seem like white folk ain't never<br />had a bright idea in they life
8422380 8425091 was coming up with all<br />kinds of ways to kill your ass.
8425258 8430555 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had<br />to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
8430722 8436269 Now, that may seem like a good idea,<br />but truth is...
8437854 8440106 when you snip a nigger's nuts,
8440273 8444485 most of them bleed out in,<br />oh, about, hm... seven minutes.
8444652 8446237 Most of 'em.
8446446 8449616 [chuckles]<br />Well, more than most.
8450366 8456206 Then I says: "Shitfire.
8456372 8460376 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8461419 8464130 And they still sayin',<br />"Let's whip him to death."
8464297 8467592 Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."<br />"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."
8467759 8470970 And I said,<br />"What's so special about that?
8471137 8473264 We do that shit all the time.
8473431 8479312 Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to<br />LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."
8480438 8483149 Lo and behold,
8483316 8488154 out of nowhere, Miss Lara<br />come up with the bright idea
8488321 8491783 of giving your ass to the<br />LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
8494160 8499290 And as a slave of the<br />LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,
8499457 8503002 henceforth, till the day you die,
8503169 8506297 all day, every day,
8506464 8509300 you will be swinging<br />a sledgehammer,
8509467 8514097 turning big rocks into little rocks.
8514264 8518851 Now, when you get there,<br />they gonna take away your name,
8519018 8521938 give you a number<br />and a sledgehammer,
8522105 8524524 and say, "Get to work!"
8524691 8527110 One word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8527277 8529612 And they good at it too.<br />You won't bleed out.
8529779 8533449 Oh, they does that real good.
8533616 8535201 They gonna work ya.
8535368 8540373 All day, every day,<br />till your back give out.
8540540 8543126 Then they're gonna hit you<br />in the head with a hammer,
8543293 8545712 throw your ass down the nigger hole.
8545878 8551259 And that will be the story of you,<br />Django.
8552802 8554721 [slow-tempo song plays]
8590298 8592858 [man, Australian accent] And what's<br />the golden rule, Frankie, eh?
8592925 8595053 You don't root abos.
8599807 8601267 Hey, white boy.
8602810 8604979 I said, hey, white boy.
8605146 8608232 Shut up, black. You ain't got<br />nothing to say I want to hear.
8608399 8610693 How'd you like to make $11,000?
8610860 8612028 Do what, now?
8612195 8617992 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?<br />11,500, actually.
8618159 8620119 What the fuck are you talking about?
8620286 8624957 Back there at that plantation,<br />Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,
8625124 8627960 just sittin' there.<br />And y'all rode right past it.
8628920 8630630 You be damned, blackie,<br />we're not bandits.
8630797 8635009 I ain't saying that. Nice thing<br />about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
8635176 8636594 You can't steal it.
8636761 8638429 You got to earn it, white boy.
8639389 8641391 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8641557 8644769 The $11,500 fortune waitin'<br />for you back at Candyland
8644936 8647063 is in the form of a<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty
8647230 8649565 on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
8649732 8651192 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8651359 8654654 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this<br />murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,
8654821 8656406 the Bacall Gang.
8656572 8659826 There's a $7,000<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,
8659992 8663329 $1,500 for each<br />of his three accomplices:
8663496 8666749 Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,
8666916 8669627 and Crazy Craig Koons.
8669794 8671212 Now, all four of them gentlemen,
8671379 8673506 they back there at Candyland<br />laughing their ass off.
8673673 8677343 You know why?<br />'Cause they just got away with murder.
8677510 8679053 But it ain't got to be that way.
8679220 8682515 You and your mates, y'all can ride back<br />there and y'all can go get that money.
8682682 8683842 What'd these jokers do again?
8683933 8687437 These sons of bitches,<br />they killed innocent people.
8687603 8690857 Stagecoach robbery.<br />Innocent white people.
8691941 8694944 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8695111 8696279 Get it out.
8698030 8703286 [man 1] "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty<br />Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."
8703453 8704787 - [man 2] But you're a slave.<br />- [man 1] "For murder..."
8704954 8707457 - [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave.<br />- [man 1] "...and stagecoach robbery."
8707623 8708903 Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
8709208 8710668 - [man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."<br />- Hm?
8710835 8713629 - [man 2] That's a shitload.<br />- I'm a bounty hunter.
8715047 8717633 Yesterday, as a free man,
8717800 8722346 I rode into Candyland on a horse<br />with my German white partner,
8722513 8724056 Dr. King Schultz.
8724223 8728978 We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way<br />from Texas to Chickasaw County.
8729145 8732064 We finally found their ass<br />layin' low in Candyland.
8732231 8735735 We went in there to get 'em,<br />things went sour,
8735902 8739238 my partner got killed,<br />Calvin Candie got shot,
8739405 8743576 then everybody there<br />decided to blame me, so here I am.
8745578 8747497 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
8747663 8750458 And all y'all know<br />I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
8750625 8753961 But them four men is still back there,<br />they're still wanted,
8754128 8757423 and that 11,500 is up for grabs,<br />and the last thing they'd expect
8757590 8759842 is y'all ridin' back in there<br />and gettin' it.
8760009 8761761 [man 1] What's the deal?
8761928 8765389 You tell us who they are<br />and we turn you loose?
8765556 8768434 No, no, no, no.<br />I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
8768601 8772104 But, you give me a pistol,<br />one of them horses,

8780196 8782281 doesn't mean that other<br />bunch of malarkey is.
