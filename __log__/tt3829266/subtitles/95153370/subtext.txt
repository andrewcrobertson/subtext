808473 809515 What am I looking at?
811184 813311 It's exactly<br />what you think it is. Yeah.
815814 817398 They've been here before.
817607 819775 '87. '97.
822029 825532 Lately, the visits<br />are increasing in frequency.
836293 839379 EMILY: Rory, I'm home!<br />Hey, I got you something.
840589 841590 Hey.
845093 847095 Did you do<br />one of these after school?
847471 848722 I did all of them.
849514 851098 Oh. Okay.
851808 855061 Well, I got you two options.
856271 857397 We have...
858231 860191 pirate, or...
862652 863694 Frankenstein.
866198 867949 Frankenstein,<br />you know, green skin?
868575 870368 Threw a girl<br />to see if she would float?
872496 873497 No. Okay.
873663 875873 Well, let's go with pirate.<br />Yeah?
876500 877542 This is dumb.
879002 880628 The guys will...
881588 883047 They will still<br />be able to see.
884424 885466 See what?
886426 887468 That it's me.
890055 892098 PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once<br />quoted as saying,
892182 894225 "I dropped<br />from my mother's womb...
894518 896228 I hit the floor...
896686 897978 and I started crawling

902734 903776 QUINN: <i>About right, yeah.</i>
903860 905778 - That's badass.<br />- It's pretty morbid.
905946 907030 It's pretty dark.
907864 910533 What's with the polygraph?
910617 911909 I thought<br />this was a psych eval.
912285 914245 We need to know<br />if you pose a threat.
914413 915580 Oh, I'm a sniper.
916415 918500 Isn't posing a threat<br />kind of the fucking point?
919334 922378 You spend most of your time<br />now in-country...
922796 924756 estranged from your wife<br />and son?
928051 929343 (sighs)
930720 932096 Look, I get it.
932848 935892 Something went down in Mexico<br />and nobody wants any witnesses.
936059 937059 Excuse me?
937394 939687 You're not here<br />to find out if I'm crazy.
940313 942273 You wanna make sure<br />the label sticks.
942482 943941 So, you feel<br />you're being railroaded?
944234 946486 I can see the tracks<br />on the floor!
948155 950035 I don't see tracks<br />on the floor, for the record.
950240 951824 You feel<br />like you're a stranger
951908 953428 on your own planet,<br />don't you, Captain?
955036 957163 Like an alien, you mean?

1063812 1065146 Did I say that out loud?
1069568 1071111 - (Quinn clears throat)<br />- McKenna.
1073989 1074990 OFFICER: Last one.
1075156 1076657 Thanks for your kindness.<br />Thank you.

1128084 1129126 Gaylord.
1129294 1131214 - That's a good call, then.<br />- Yeah, I thought so.
1131379 1132630 (chuckles)
1132714 1134006 Where did you serve?
1134591 1136509 Operation<br />Enduring Freedom, '03.
1137177 1139846 Went for the Taliban,<br />stayed for the opium.

1146603 1149188 Got turned around, fired<br />at one of his own vehicles.
1150398 1151607 Now, he tells jokes.
1151691 1152775 (Coyle clears throat)
1152859 1154986 - (thuds)<br />- (grunts) That's Lynch.
1155445 1157530 Got a medal for blowing up<br />half a mountain in Mosul.
1158156 1159407 Entropy.

1166998 1168666 Just... Just like that.

1178802 1180887 (stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.
1181262 1182888 Did three tours flying Hueys.
1183056 1185183 He loves his Bible.<br />Hey, Netty?
1185350 1186851 Is it end times yet?
1187018 1188394 Yeah, laugh all you want.
1188520 1190539 But when you're standing at<br />attention before your Maker...
1190563 1192398 I always stand at attention<br />before I make her.
1192607 1194191 - (whistles)<br />- (laughter)
1194359 1195902 God makes shitty people.
1196569 1197570 Yeah.
1197696 1199823 I mean, why do you think<br />people make war?
1199989 1201323 Why, Baxley?<br />Why do we make war?
1201491 1203743 - Come on, Baxley!<br />- Because fuck-cock-cock!
1203910 1205870 - Because we fuck cock-cock?<br />- Yes, we fuck cocks.
1205912 1207181 That's it,<br />because we fuck cocks,
1207205 1208497 that's why. We get upset.
1208873 1211083 How'd you snag a ticket<br />on this shitmobile?
1211751 1213252 Put a bullet in a CO.
1214295 1215754 Any particular reason?
1217507 1218716 He was an asshole.
1241865 1243157 Keep your head down.
1251624 1252791 Here, throw this on.
1257756 1259048 (bell rings)

1280820 1283322 Welcome.<br />I'm Sean Keyes.
1283990 1285908 Wow. I heard you basically<br />wrote the book
1285992 1287284 on evolutionary biology.
1287452 1289120 Um, I'm sorry, can I just...
1289412 1290496 Is that...?
1293291 1294750 Oh, my God!
1296336 1298796 (chuckles nervously)<br />Holy shit.
1299297 1300840 That's alien technology.
1303176 1304802 This is what<br />you brought me here to see?
1305553 1307179 KEYES: Well, yeah.
1307972 1310516 Can I... Can I see this?<br />Can I get into this?
1310892 1311893 Doc.
1312644 1313686 Let's go.
1313895 1315980 (indistinct PA announcement)
1326616 1328326 - TRAEGER: <i>Everything good?<br />- Yes, sir.</i>
1329536 1330745 TRAEGER: <i>What is it?</i>
1332747 1333831 <i>Dr. Brackett.</i>
1334457 1336167 <i>Would you like<br />to meet a Predator?</i>
1336918 1338294 (chuckles) <i>Come on.</i>
1346845 1348137 WOMAN (on PA):<br /><i>Please observe</i>
1348263 1350056 <i>decontamination protocol.</i>
1350765 1352683 KEYES: So, how'd they<br />rope you into this?
1353059 1355144 I wrote a letter to<br />the president when I was six.
1355311 1356645 Told him how much<br />I loved animals,
1356729 1358409 and that if NASA<br />ever found a space animal,
1358565 1359774 they should call me.
1360233 1362735 Couple years ago,<br />I was put on a short list
1362902 1364653 for a paper<br />I wrote on hybrid strains.
1364946 1368324 Computer cross-referenced<br />the letter, and... here I am.
1370034 1371452 (machine whirring)
1376082 1377249 Dr. Brackett.
1378334 1379668 Thanks for coming.
1379836 1381128 I'm sure you have questions.
1381462 1383964 - Oh. Just two, actually.<br />- Okay.
1384465 1385924 Why do you call it<br />"the Predator"?
1386718 1388177 It's a nickname.
1388970 1391681 You know, the data suggests<br />that it tracks its prey.
1391931 1393265 Exploits weakness.
1393558 1394976 Seems to...
1395560 1396644 well, enjoy it.
1396936 1398145 Like a game.
1398313 1400231 That's not a predator,<br />that's a sports hunter.
1400315 1401315 Sorry?
1401482 1403609 A predator<br />kills its prey to survive.
1403776 1407488 I mean, what you're describing<br />is more like a bass fisherman.
1407655 1409531 Well, we took a vote.<br />Predator's cooler, right?
1409657 1411533 - SAPIR: Fuck yeah.<br />- Fuck yeah.
1411826 1413577 Found his escape pod<br />in Mexico.
1413745 1415413 Still looking<br />for the ship he came in.
1416289 1417707 He's heavily sedated.
1423546 1425798 You are<br />one beautiful motherfucker.
1426841 1429593 I'm gonna guess your second<br />question is, why are you here?
1431846 1434932 Our test results yielded<br />something a little... odd.
1436768 1438311 (scoffs) Is this a joke?
1438978 1441063 KEYES: We ran the genome<br />sequence ten times.
1441564 1442982 This specimen has...
1443149 1444650 - Human DNA?<br />- Yeah.
1444859 1445860 Yeah.
1445944 1448780 Look, we know<br />about spontaneous speciation.
1448863 1450281 Mostly plants and insects,<br />but...
1450448 1453075 But some mammals,<br />sheep, goats, uh...
1453159 1454034 Yeah.
1454160 1455840 KEYES: The red wolf<br />is known to be a hybrid

2459790 2461030 I should have bet you<br />that time!
2461083 2462268 WILLIAMS: I like her.<br />I like her.
2462292 2463436 I should have bet you<br />that time!
2463460 2464771 - I like her.<br />- NETTLES: I like her.
2464795 2466046 I like her. I like her a lot.
2466213 2467464 QUINN: Give me that,<br />ding-dong.
2467631 2470383 COYLE: Oh, shit! Attagirl.
2470676 2473762 What? You're a scientist, huh?<br />What they got you working on?
2474638 2476681 You're not gonna last a day<br />out there!
2478934 2480602 What, you think you're special?
2481186 2483506 Back at the dam, they were gonna<br />put a bullet in your head.
2484064 2485190 They were gonna shoot her?
2485357 2486358 Yes.
2486984 2488276 Oh, I'm sorry.
2488777 2490820 Get out of the way.<br />See you around.
2493156 2494657 (stutters) Eat your pussy.
2495242 2496326 Wait, what?
2496493 2497702 How you doing?
2497869 2499269 No, you just said,<br />"Eat your pussy."
2499371 2500288 Hey...
2500372 2502100 - How you doing?<br />- No, you said, "Eat my pussy."
2502124 2503364 What the fuck<br />is wrong with him?
2503417 2505061 - I said you're pushy.<br />- He said you're pushy.
2505085 2506145 No, you said,<br />"Eat your pussy."
2506169 2507753 No. I said,<br />"Sheesh! You're pushy!"
2507879 2509148 CASEY: No, you said,<br />"Eat my pussy."
2509172 2510525 No, that's what he said,<br />I heard it.
2510549 2512175 - He said... pushy.<br />- What the fuck?
2512342 2513926 Which is also fucking rude.
2514011 2515530 He doesn't mean your pussy<br />in particular.
2515554 2516930 You're insane, right?
2517014 2518408 - Are you fucking insane?<br />- COYLE: Probably.
2518432 2519433 Well, what's it gonna be?
2519558 2521160 - BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy.<br />- NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.
2521184 2522226 BAXLEY: I feel fine.
2522853 2524093 CASEY: They were gonna<br />shoot me?
2524646 2525647 Why?
2526189 2529650 Uh, maybe 'cause of this?
2534656 2535990 Well, I guess I'm in.
2537367 2538910 Stay the fuck away from me.
2542414 2543623 What the fuck is this?
2544750 2545959 What is this?
2546168 2548461 - What is that? Like a unicorn?<br />- NETTLES: A unicorn.
2548628 2549962 - It's a unicorn.<br />- A unicorn.
2550255 2551756 I made a unicorn...
2551882 2553466 I'm sorry,<br />it's a piece of shit.
2553633 2556302 So, what's the upside to me<br />staying here with you guys?
2556470 2558054 Uh, maybe staying alive?
2558221 2559472 We are soldiers.
2559598 2560765 We're the good guys, okay?
2560891 2562183 CASEY: Well, that's debatable.
2562309 2566271 I read your file.<br />The guys in Mexico it killed?
2566396 2567438 They yours?
2567981 2569399 They're gonna need<br />a patsy for that.
2569483 2570650 You're looking at him.
2570901 2572110 Yeah, I figured.
2572277 2574570 Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's<br />actually kind of perfect.
2574738 2575989 How about you telling us
2576281 2577907 what you were doing<br />in a secret base.
2578075 2580911 Surrounded by<br />trained soldiers. Mercs.
2582496 2586124 I'm a biologist, and they have<br />me on call in case there's...
2588085 2589169 contact.
2590754 2591838 What did I tell you?
2592005 2593673 End days. End days.
2593882 2595401 Nettles, if you don't stop<br />with this Bible shit,
2595425 2596551 I'm gonna set you on fire.
2596718 2598136 Guys, if we wanna<br />keep breathing,
2598220 2599763 we need to find this thing.
2599971 2601055 Expose it.
2601848 2603224 It's called the Predator.
2603725 2605226 It hunts people for sport.
2605352 2607562 Technically, that's not<br />a predator. That's like...
2607646 2608647 Thank you.
2608772 2610291 - It's a hunter.<br />- I said the same thing.
2610315 2611918 - I said the same thing earlier.<br />- NETTLES: ...or a fisherman.
2611942 2613022 COYLE: Well, look at you...
2613068 2615268 I was there when it escaped.<br />It's looking for something.
2615821 2617656 Equipment. Weapons.
2620325 2621576 I took its gear.
2622661 2623661 What?
2623703 2624931 You took something<br />from the thing?
2624955 2626748 - What?<br />- So, I'd have evidence.
2628333 2629876 I think I know<br />where it's going.
2633797 2635340 (whirring)
2661575 2662701 (growls)
2663493 2664619 What?
2675213 2677423 (indistinct chattering)
2683221 2684764 (door opens)
2688268 2690061 Oh, hi, honey, you're home.
2690770 2692938 - I'm looking for a package.<br />- A package?
2693106 2694107 Rory!
2694357 2695900 Hey! This is<br />not your house anymore!
2696067 2697234 QUINN: Rory!
2697402 2699987 Hey, buddy. Where are ya?
2700447 2701865 He's not here.
2702199 2703533 What do you mean,<br />he's not here?
2704993 2706035 Oh, shit!
2706203 2707954 What? So we<br />ordered some video games.
2708121 2709956 No! No! No!
2710123 2712250 The whole fucking reason<br />I sent it to a P.O. box,
2712417 2714001 was so<br />I didn't put you in danger.
2714586 2715771 Goddamn it,<br />we need to find him.
2715795 2717155 Wait, Quinn,<br />you're scaring me now.
2717297 2718673 (footsteps)
2720050 2721885 (indistinct chatter)
2727140 2728266 I specifically said
2728350 2730060 no first-person shooter.<br />No combat games.
2730227 2731907 Did you ever think that<br />maybe he plays them
2731937 2733017 to connect with his father?
2733063 2734415 Oh, my God.<br />We're doing this again.
2734439 2736065 Hey! Can you<br />stop taking all my...
2738276 2739652 Who are these people<br />in my house?
2739736 2741738 Emily, loonies.<br />Loonies, Emily.
2741905 2743197 Good evening.
2743365 2744783 Uh, the brushstrokes on this
2744866 2746546 are really dynamic.<br />It's a wonderful piece.
2746618 2748077 Okay, you need<br />to put that down.
2748245 2750045 What exactly is she doing<br />with her right hand?
2750163 2751497 They're my unit.<br />They're soldiers.
2751706 2753999 Marines. There's his unit.<br />(laughing)
2754292 2755603 Hi. You seem like<br />a really nice...
2755627 2757253 Oh, no, don't touch me. No.
2757420 2759547 Hang on. Back up.<br />Your unit?
2759631 2761549 What happened<br />to Haines and Dupree?
2762926 2763927 They're dead.
2764010 2766113 And the thing that killed them<br />is out there looking for Rory.
2766137 2767388 What are you talking about?
2767472 2768592 There's something out there.
2769474 2771434 It tore my friends apart.<br />What is it?
2771518 2772435 (Coyle stuttering)
2772519 2774604 Like, it's a creature.<br />Seriously, it's not a person.
2774771 2775771 Like from the Bible.
2775981 2777440 - Revelations.<br />- From the Bible?
2777524 2779444 That's the most ridiculous<br />thing I've ever heard.
2779526 2780526 It's a space alien.
2781027 2782445 Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?
2782737 2784155 It's like<br />an alien Whoopi Goldberg.
2785156 2786323 Oh, shit!
2786908 2787825 Shit.
2787909 2789118 I want a grid search.
2789286 2790370 Three teams.
2790829 2791913 (men exclaiming)
2792080 2793080 Hey!
2793999 2795834 - No.<br />- No, no, I'm coming with you.
2796001 2797210 QUINN: No, nix that.
2797294 2798461 (gun cocking)
2798586 2800045 (Quinn clears throat)
2801673 2802965 Is there a problem?
2804301 2806052 Thing is, we're<br />kind of moving targets.
2806219 2808554 Yeah, in case you haven't<br />noticed, we're fugitives.
2808680 2810574 Yeah. Plus, like where are we<br />gonna get our meds and stuff?
2810598 2812118 I get it. Fine,<br />stay here and watch TV.
2812267 2815270 You know what? If you try<br />to split? Or draw the Feds?
2815437 2816604 Or if you jeopardize my son
2816771 2818856 by your half-assed<br />yardbird bullshit...
2818982 2820543 I will come back here,<br />and I will happily
2820567 2822277 kill every single<br />fucking one of you.
2828366 2830159 WILLIAMS: Come on,<br />brothers. Let's go.
2830785 2832036 (door closes)
2833038 2834039 Seriously?
2834622 2835956 It's not our fight.
2841004 2842755 Is your husband<br />the man I think he is?
2843840 2844882 Excuse me?
2845800 2847176 Tell me<br />about your husband, please?
2849262 2851097 He's a security<br />counter-sniper.
2851181 2852515 - Mmm.<br />- Army Rangers.
2853725 2854809 He supervised
2854893 2857520 23 close precision engagements<br />across five continents
2857687 2860022 and he has 13 confirmed kills.
2860565 2863276 And he is one of only 14<br />captains in the armed forces,
2863401 2865194 to ever receive<br />a Distinguished Service Medal
2865278 2866404 and the Silver Star.
2867697 2869198 So, he might be<br />a lousy husband,
2869282 2870741 but he is a good soldier.
2872869 2875580 Well, sounds like he can<br />probably take care of himself.
2875747 2877123 - Yeah.<br />- Jesus Christ.
2877290 2878416 That's what I thought.
2879376 2880585 Fucking pussies.
2882420 2884171 (door opens and closes)
2884297 2885464 Where you going, Nettles?
2887425 2889927 I didn't like your speech.<br />It didn't really inspire me.
2890637 2893348 But... he called me a pussy
2893515 2895391 and nobody<br />calls me a pussy, so...
2895517 2896976 - Fuck off, pussy.<br />- Okay...
2897060 2898311 (clears throat)
2901231 2903191 Come on, Bax, let's go.<br />Let's get some.
2903316 2905735 Before these army fuckers<br />screw up the whole thing.
2910073 2911175 Come on, what are you doing?<br />Let's move.
2911199 2912199 Hey!
2912283 2913284 You too, lucky charms.
2913368 2914452 LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.
2916746 2917955 I'd like to watch TV
2918039 2919248 - with you sometime.<br />- Okay.
2919416 2920417 I liked your speech.
2920583 2921834 BAXLEY: I liked the couch.
2923878 2925796 Whoa, what's happening? What?
2926423 2928508 Well, we're finding my son,<br />that's what.
2929384 2930802 All right,<br />when all this is over...
2931010 2933053 Fuck me in the face<br />with an aardvark.
2933138 2934264 (groaning)
2936266 2937350 I just want to be famous.
2937434 2938351 LYNCH: Ostensibly,
2938435 2940079 if Forrest Gump<br />just read the side of the box,
2940103 2941580 it would tell him exactly<br />what he would get.
2941604 2943249 COYLE: You're using<br />"ostensibly" incorrectly.
2943273 2944274 Is this for me?
2944399 2945959 This is like the reverse<br />of a clown car.
2946317 2947317 All right, Nebraska,
2947360 2948712 let's find some wheels,<br />nothing flashy.
2948736 2949737 Copy.
2949821 2952532 All right. Find my son.
2952824 2954242 Casey, you're with me.
2954742 2955742 Let's go.
2957036 2958370 DEREK: Hey, ass-burger.
2961875 2963209 What are you supposed to be?
2963376 2964460 RORY: Leave me alone.
2964627 2967504 EJ: Or what? You'll wash our<br />hands five hundred times?
2967589 2968715 (snickers)
2969507 2970716 (doorbell rings)
2971050 2972384 RORY: Trick or treat?
2977515 2978933 EJ: What's the matter, dude?
2979267 2980393 (chuckles)
2980518 2982144 Here's a treat,<br />you little shit.
2982604 2983813 - Oh!<br />- (laughs)
2984397 2985564 (helmet whirring)
2989152 2990528 (grunting)
2993865 2995950 (tires screeching)
2999370 3001663 (indistinct shouting)
3001956 3004124 - (horns honking)<br />- (alarms blaring)
3011591 3013050 (whimpering)
3020183 3021744 OFFICER (on radio):<br /><i>I got a male juvenile.</i>
3021768 3023144 <i>10 to 12 years old.</i>
3023353 3024479 <i>Metal cast on his arm.</i>
3024646 3025789 Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?
3025813 3027293 OFFICER:<br /><i>Ran right in front of my car.</i>
3028107 3029274 <i>Moving east on Woodruff.</i>
3029359 3031444 <i>Repeat, moving<br />east on Woodruff.</i>
3034906 3036908 (sirens wailing in distance)
3037784 3039535 (panting)
3039869 3041537 Nebraska, you got wheels?
3041704 3043622 WILLIAMS: <i>Yeah, I got wheels.<br />Something flashy.</i>
3045208 3047668 Listen, the kid's spooked,<br />he's rabbiting.
3047835 3050546 Where's he headed?<br />Where's some place he knows?
3054008 3055300 (faint growl)

3105810 3106811 There he is.
3112984 3114068 Dad!
3117864 3119615 How you doing, buddy, huh?
3119782 3120824 I'm good.
3126205 3127372 (grunts)
3130168 3131252 (grunts)
3132211 3134129 - Move! Move!<br />- (gasps)
3135089 3136840 Hey, Doc, come get my kid.
3141262 3142680 (roars)
3142889 3144515 Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!<br />Come on!
3145433 3146642 BAXLEY: Oh, shit!

3181344 3182946 BAXLEY: Williams<br />Get the fuck out of there!
3182970 3184304 (indistinct shouting)
3184764 3186682 COYLE: What are you doing?<br />Get out of there!
3187266 3188433 Oh, shit!
3188685 3190019 (whining)
3192980 3194314 Oh. Okay.
3203408 3205868 WILLIAMS: Doc, the dreads.<br />What's that all about?
3206035 3208454 CASEY: I don't know.<br />Maybe, like, sensor receptors.
3208621 3209788 Kind of like cat whiskers.
3210707 3212709 Whoa! What the...<br />I'm getting a sample.
3212875 3214167 It's a fucking space dog.
3215628 3216670 You okay? Huh?
3217630 3218672 (grunts)
3219465 3221025 What, is your mom<br />cutting your hair now?
3221092 3222152 CASEY: You kidding me?<br />This is
3222176 3223654 - a once-in-a-lifetime moment.<br />- Shut up. Please shut up.
3223678 3224738 All I wanted<br />was a little sample.
3224762 3225637 Please shut up.
3225722 3226865 All I wanted was<br />a goddamn fucking sample.
3226889 3227890 Come here.
3231144 3232145 - Sample.<br />- (grunts)
3232228 3233288 - There you go.<br />- Thank you.
3233312 3234992 - You're welcome.<br />- Fucking space dog, man.
3235064 3236417 - My man, you need to...<br />- It's a fucking...
3236441 3237442 I can't. I can't.
3237608 3239328 - QUINN: Get it together.<br />- I can't do this.

3922793 3924377 We think there's<br />something on it.
3924795 3926555 Something he didn't want<br />his enemies to have.
3927089 3928215 CASEY: Wait, enemies?
3928590 3930717 Other Predators.<br />Like that big one.

3933637 3935156 I'll help you find it.<br />We can analyze it...
3935180 3936472 Shut the fuck up!

3943856 3946400 You remember a few years back<br />when Hostess went bust?
3947067 3948943 There was a run on Twinkies?
3949236 3951071 Snapped up<br />from coast-to-coast.
3951155 3952781 Get 'em while they still last.
3953615 3954616 Remember?

3960414 3961623 <i>Two</i> generations?
3962666 3963708 One?
3963876 3965711 CASEY: That's why their visits<br />are increasing?
3965794 3966920 They're trying to snap up
3967004 3968484 all of our best DNA<br />before we're gone.
3968797 3972008 Adapt themselves with it<br />and then move in.
3972634 3975219 We're an endangered species,<br />and they know it.
3975387 3977013 They thrive<br />in a hothouse environment.
3977389 3979224 Maybe they want<br />to move into ours.
3980142 3981351 And that dead Predator
3981435 3983145 was bringing us<br />a way to stop them.

4088041 4089042 (grunts)
4091336 4092545 (whimpering)
4092796 4095048 Hey, Rory, I'm Will.
4095632 4096716 How you doing?
4097217 4099135 I understand you know<br />where the spaceship is.
4113150 4114151 Golf tomorrow?
4114526 4115610 Why not?
4116320 4118322 You two never read<br />my file, did ya?
4118947 4120073 What makes you say that?
4120240 4122533 'Cause you two morons<br />are making plans for tomorrow.
4123035 4124077 (laughing)
4124161 4125287 The worst part is,
4125537 4127622 you're making me lie to my son.
4129124 4130708 What lie did you<br />tell him, hmm?
4132085 4133503 That I won't enjoy this.
4134963 4136339 (grunting)
4138008 4139009 (screams)
4139092 4140593 (mouthing)
4142387 4143846 - (gun cocking)<br />- Hey, please, don't.
4144890 4146641 Look, I don't know<br />what they told you...
4146808 4148976 Can you just wait<br />for a second? Just wait!
4149186 4150604 No, no, no!
4151146 4152147 No.
4152397 4153940 (grunting softly)
4157402 4159153 - Jeez!<br />- (yipping)
4159237 4160321 Oh, my God.
4165577 4166578 (retches)
4172250 4173501 (both grunting)
4187307 4188308 (gasping)
4192813 4194189 (grunting)
4197651 4198693 Nebraska!
4198944 4200654 - Yeah?<br />- You just kill somebody?
4200779 4201780 Well, he ain't well.
4201947 4203073 Untie my friend.
4203240 4204616 They got Rory. We gotta move.
4205200 4206492 Shit, they rough you up?
4206868 4208578 Did worse on myself,<br />back in the day.
4208662 4210080 (grunting)
4210205 4211748 What do you want to do<br />with this guy?
4214668 4216211 Sorry, buddy,<br />that was a dumb question.
4216378 4217578 Yeah, that was<br />a dumb question.
4218505 4219964 (panting)
4225470 4226637 (low growling)
4230809 4231810 QUINN: Casey!
4234896 4236898 Can I interest you in getting<br />the fuck out of here?
4237691 4239611 "Getting the fuck out of here"<br />is my middle name.
4240277 4241820 And I thought Gaylord was bad.
4241903 4242904 (Quinn groans)
4242988 4244239 (stomach grumbling)
4244781 4246491 What? What's wrong?
4247242 4248743 (toilet flushing)
4249911 4251746 Whew! All right.
4251997 4253957 Hey! Just let me unpack this.
4254124 4255810 You're saying my son's headed<br />towards a spaceship
4255834 4257001 and so is a 10-foot alien.
4257169 4258378 Uh, 11, actually.
4258545 4259879 Used to be a contractor.
4260172 4261774 This thing is a hybrid?<br />What does that mean?
4261798 4263758 Meaning it's the Chinese menu<br />of DNA.
4263925 4265925 Comprised of the deadliest<br />species in the entire...
4265969 4267129 In the entire universe, yeah?
4267262 4268554 - Galaxy.<br />- What?
4268764 4270724 Galaxy. 250 billion stars.
4270849 4272433 Why go universe? Just saying.
4273018 4274436 (helicopter whirring)
4286531 4288407 Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!
4288533 4289573 That's what you asked for?
4289618 4290619 Yeah, that'll do.
4292245 4293454 Saddle up!
4297209 4298689 COYLE: It's the best<br />we could do, man.
4301755 4302756 WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!
4302839 4304048 That's it? Another one.
4304216 4305217 QUINN: The other one!
4305383 4306842 Come on.<br />Let's go get my kid.
4310347 4312557 Figured something out.<br />I think we're gonna die.
4313642 4315562 We're gonna go hunt and fight<br />the what, the army?
4315685 4316996 COYLE: We're not gonna<br />fight the army...
4317020 4318700 BAXLEY: And some<br />fucking people from space!
4318730 4320189 You wanna talk survival, huh?
4320732 4321733 Fine!
4321858 4323943 You, yesterday,<br />you were on a prison bus
4324027 4325153 barking to yourself,
4325278 4326904 now you got a gun<br />in your hand.
4327113 4328322 Who's a survivor now?
4330200 4331576 We put bullets in our head
4331660 4333119 and walk<br />to the fucking hospital.
4333703 4334787 We're soldiers
4336414 4337748 Nettles, what's our 20?
4338333 4339959 I can follow<br />your boy's chopper.
4340043 4341294 I locked into its frequency.
4355684 4356810 SOLDIER: Fence is hot!
4374077 4375536 (indistinct radio chatter)
4376913 4378122 What do you say, buddy?
4379082 4380416 You think you can get us<br />in there?
4381293 4383253 Because I'm not sure<br />that you can.
4383795 4385087 Nice reverse psychology.
4385714 4387006 I can do that, too.
4387257 4388466 Don't go fuck yourself.
4389759 4390885 (laughs)
4391887 4393346 TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.
4393847 4395974 Good. Almost up and running.<br />Five minutes.
4396057 4397058 TRAEGER: Right on.
4397142 4398518 It's a translator unit, Rory.
4398852 4399894 Been trying to figure out
4400061 4401372 what these<br />bird-chirping motherfuckers
4401396 4402647 been saying since '87.
4402814 4404482 Gave the Harvard School<br />of Linguistics
4404566 4405775 a billion-dollar grant.
4405942 4408152 Voila. Watch your step,<br />come on.
4420582 4422959 Goddamn, kid, I don't know<br />where you get it from.
4424210 4426003 (trilling)
4450487 4452363 TRAEGER: Put the translator<br />into the mainframe.
4452447 4453614 Download everything.
4460538 4461938 SAPIR: What the hell's<br />inside there?
4462082 4463625 It's property<br />of Project Stargazer.
4463708 4465751 That's what the fuck it is.<br />(laughs)
4467796 4469398 OFFICER (on comms):<br /><i>Code three. Code three.</i>
4469422 4470942 <i>We have motion<br />at the south fence line.</i>
4471257 4472591 Send a fireteam<br />to check it out.
4472926 4475053 That's my dad.<br />He's gonna come save me now.
4475595 4476637 Oh, is he?
4477931 4479307 Is that what he's gonna do?
4480058 4481350 I'll tell you what, buddy...
4482519 4483770 if it is your daddy,
4484187 4485980 and I truly hope that it is...
4486648 4488441 he's gotta be just about
4488525 4491694 the dumbest motherfucker<br />I've ever met. (laughing)
4493905 4496991 I mean, a Ranger sniper<br />tripping wire sensors?
4497200 4498451 He's gotta be...
4500120 4501329 creating a diversion.
4501496 4502872 It's a fucking diversion.
4503331 4504332 (grunts)
4505750 4507084 Wow. Howdy.
4507335 4509415 What, are you gonna kill us<br />with a fucking tranq gun?
4509796 4511422 You took my boy, so yeah.
4512132 4513133 Told you.
4514050 4515051 Take this, son.
4515593 4518012 You outta your mind? We<br />literally have you surrounded.
4518138 4519514 That's why<br />you're coming with me.
4519597 4521158 I just want the boy.<br />Nobody's got to die.
4521182 4522182 Dad?
4524644 4525978 From here forward.
4526146 4527605 Don't look at the dead guy.
4541953 4543287 (grunting)
4548209 4549418 That was pretty good.
4549544 4550704 You all right? Did I get you?
4550754 4551755 No, I'm good.
4552672 4553756 Welcome back.
4553882 4555008 Fuck you. I never left.
4558011 4559053 You open your mouth,
4559220 4560940 I'm gonna blow your brains<br />right through it.
4561056 4562223 Come on, just get behind me.
4562724 4564368 SOLDIER (on radio):<br /><i>All units. They got Traeger.</i>
4564392 4565434 <i>They got Traeger.</i>
4566978 4568145 (softly) Let's go. Let's go.
4568813 4570481 Just tell them<br />to put the guns down.
4580241 4581283 Tell them!
4583203 4584680 If Captain McKenna<br />doesn't lower his weapon
4584704 4585704 in the next 10 seconds...
4585997 4587725 shoot the kid's knees out.<br />That work for you?
4587749 4589083 Oh, that's a really bad idea.
4589417 4591585 My guys got this place covered<br />on every angle.
4591753 4593439 That's a funny story.<br />See, I don't give a shit.
4593463 4594463 10.
4595715 4596757 Nine.
4597467 4598468 Eight.
4599844 4600845 Seven.
4601513 4603389 Come on, you just give<br />the fucking word, man.
4603473 4604474 TRAEGER: Six. Five.
4604557 4605933 (predator clicking)

4619823 4621241 - (distant yelling)<br />- Oh, shit!
4621699 4622908 (grunting)
4623034 4624118 Come on, son!
4625245 4626663 (indistinct shouting)
4626746 4627788 Take them down!
4633920 4634921 Get down, sir.
4635088 4636506 Let's go, son. Go!
4636631 4637798 SOLDIER: Move. Move. Move.
4643763 4645389 Okay, take this. (spits)
4646808 4647809 You wanna vanish,
4647892 4649435 you really vanish, son,<br />you understand?
4649811 4652104 All right, we're going home.<br />I promise you.
4657402 4658653 (predator growls)
4661990 4662991 It's here.
4669706 4671207 - (predator growls)<br />- No! No! No!
4677380 4679100 SOLDIER 2: Come on,<br />go around the end there!
4679257 4680424 Stay on him!<br />Stay on him!
4680800 4681926 Move, move, move!
4682135 4683511 - You got him?<br />- SOLDIER 3: Yeah!
4695064 4696565 - (explosion)<br />- QUINN: Stay back.
4696691 4697858 Get down! Get down!
4700403 4704281 SOLDIER 4: Cease fire!<br />Cease fire! Cease fire!
4713583 4715793 (low growling)
4716294 4718129 (both panting quietly)
4731059 4732435 - COYLE: Huh?<br />- All right.
4732936 4734020 Hey, McKenna.
4734270 4736939 Be reasonable. There's six<br />of you, seven of us.
4737732 4738816 (grunts)
4739067 4740068 Fuck!
4740235 4741694 Who taught you math?
4741986 4743988 You ain't the only<br />fucking sniper, white boy.
4745949 4748076 You can walk away<br />from this, Captain.
4748785 4750161 I just want the ship.
4750328 4752413 - Dad, he's lying.<br />- Yeah.
4752580 4754873 McKenna! I don't like this.
4755333 4756584 What's he doing in there?
4758628 4759920 (predator warbling)
4761256 4763508 - (loud warbling)<br />- (feedback whines)
4765218 4767303 (all groan)
4768471 4770097 It's using the translator.
4772350 4774310 PREDATOR (over speaker):<br /><i>Hello. I have enjoyed</i>
4774560 4776019 <i>watching you kill each other.</i>
4776521 4778814 <i>I came here<br />to destroy this vessel.</i>
4779190 4780774 <i>You cannot have it.</i>
4780942 4783110 <i>What you can do is run.</i>
4783778 4786697 <i>I detect one among you<br />who is a true warrior.</i>
4787156 4789032 <i>The one called McKenna.</i>
4791077 4792369 <i>He will be your leader.</i>
4793121 4794372 <i>He will be my prize.</i>
4794789 4796624 <i>I offer time advantage.</i>
4797583 4798584 <i>Go.</i>
4799043 4800502 What the fuck<br />is time advantage?
4800586 4801670 Like a head start?
4802755 4804923 (alarm sounding)
4805300 4806759 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4807719 4809011 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4811973 4812974 Hey!
4813391 4814433 I'm coming out!
4824110 4825111 We're in.
4826029 4827405 - Baxley!<br />- Shit!
4827613 4829656 Watch where the fuck you're<br />throwing, dickhead.
4829741 4831221 - (vehicle engine stalling)<br />- Will do.
4832035 4834203 Okay, so we split up.<br />12 different directions.
4834287 4836140 - McKenna's the one he wants.<br />- TRAEGER: No, no, no!
4836164 4838416 We stay together,<br />or it'll take us one by one.
4838499 4839875 He's right. It's their MO.
4840043 4842021 - Grow a dick, will you?<br />- SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!
4842045 4844130 Son of a bitch. He must have<br />hacked the vehicles.
4844380 4846548 If we can get to the helicopter,<br />go two klicks north.
4846632 4847633 - Got you.<br />- Hey?
4847717 4849719 When this is over, you and me,<br />we're gonna dance.
4849802 4850988 I got my shoes all picked out.
4851012 4852013 All right.
4858061 4859854 (soft growling)
4860104 4861939 - Fuck.<br />- No, no, no! Don't.
4862857 4864733 Here, boy. Fetch.
4865943 4867421 - (creature barks)<br />- Here, boy. (whistles)
4867445 4868446 Here you go.
4871407 4872866 That was a valuable weapon.
4874952 4876662 Let's go.<br />He'll be coming for us.
4877622 4879332 (alarm blaring)
4903481 4904899 (warbling)
4905191 4906192 (device beeps)
4915410 4916744 Give me the goody bag.
4918413 4920832 Hey. On Halloween,<br />this blew up a whole house.
4920998 4922582 - How do you shoot it?<br />- You don't.
4922750 4924670 It just fires by itself<br />when it's being attacked.
4924836 4926295 Seriously? Oh, shit.
4928005 4929548 (man coughing)
4930800 4932593 (faint rustling)
4934762 4936013 I heard something.
4936180 4938307 TRAEGER: Hey, man.<br />That's Predator technology.
4939517 4940518 Fuck.
4940726 4942227 That... It's gonna come back.
4942353 4944104 You got, uh, a catcher<br />on the wrist.
4944814 4945940 That's gonna come back.
4947442 4948443 No!
4949485 4951361 - (screaming)<br />- Quiet. Quiet.
4952363 4954083 - Let me see. Let me see.<br />- My fucking hand.
4954115 4955491 - Shit.<br />- My fucking hand.
4957869 4958953 Gotta be quiet.
4964208 4965250 (screaming)
4969630 4971089 (predator warbles)
4977805 4978931 Moving!
4995072 4997157 No, no, no!<br />This way. This way. This way.
4998534 4999868 There's a clearing up ahead.
5000328 5002368 Lynch left some pyro up there.<br />To cover our retreat.
5002497 5004081 Let's find it<br />and trap the motherfucker.
5004248 5006625 You guys go set it up.<br />We'll lure him in.
5007001 5008544 - Who?<br />- You and me.
5008628 5009629 Yeah? All right.
5009962 5011463 - Yeah.<br />- Let's go.
5012507 5013508 Come on.
5015426 5016927 Can I talk to you<br />for a second?
5017011 5018095 What's this "we" shit?
5018304 5019656 What, are you gonna<br />live forever, Coyle?
5019680 5021120 - Just calm down.<br />- COYLE: Calm down?
5021265 5024059 Me, calm down?<br />Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.
5024185 5026187 Move, move, move!<br />Up here. Up, up, up.
5043871 5045289 (owl hooting)
5048417 5050210 - (indistinct animal croaking)<br />- Shit!
5053005 5054089 Okay, fuck this.
5055424 5056842 Hey! Asshole!
5057343 5058385 What the fuck was that?
