157233 159774 <i>We were not<br />the Railway Children to begin with.</i>
159900 162565 <i>I don't suppose we even thought<br />about railways</i>
162691 166565 <i>except as a means of getting<br />to the theatre and the zoo.</i>
166691 169190 <i>We were just ordinary<br />suburban children</i>
169316 171815 <i>and we lived<br />with Father and Mother</i>
171941 174524 <i>in an ordinary<br />red brick fronted villa</i>
174650 176690 <i>with coloured glass<br />in the front door...</i>
176816 177899 Come on.
178025 180732 <i>...a tiled passage<br />that was called a hall</i>
180858 184274 <i>and big fires<br />in big fireplaces.</i>
186191 188149 <i>We even had a gas fire<br />in the breakfast room</i>
189525 190899 <i>and a servant's bell board.</i>
193941 196857 <i>In fact,<br />every modern convenience.</i>
198191 199732 Chins up!
202900 204399 <i>There we three of us.</i>
204525 206190 Now let's arrange your pretty hair.
206316 207940 <i>That's me, I'm Roberta.</i>
208066 210857 <i>They call me Bobbie,<br />sometimes Lanky.</i>
210983 213399 <i>I'm the eldest, worst luck.</i>
214608 217732 <i>That's Phyllis, who means well.</i>
219691 223107 <i>And that's Peter,<br />who wants to be an engineer.</i>
223816 226774 And don't forget<br />to watch the dickey bird.
228775 230357 Watch the birdie.
234525 236607 Oh...
243025 247690 <i>Mother did not spend all her time<br />paying dull calls to dull ladies</i>
247816 251982 <i>and sitting dully at home waiting<br />for dull ladies to pay calls on her.</i>
252775 255274 <i>She was always there,<br />with us.</i>
261733 264690 <i>We had a father<br />who was just perfect.</i>
267191 271065 Her light's growing dim<br />and if it goes out, then she's dead.
271191 274065 She says she would be get well again<br />if children believed in fairies.
274191 277024 - Do you believe in fairies?<br />- Yes.
277150 280065 That's not loud enough.<br />Do you believe in fairies?
280191 281565 Yes!
281691 284357 It's still not loud enough.<br />Do you believe in fairies?
284483 285899 YES!
286025 287565 Yes, I certainly do!
294025 296399 Mmm, it smells gorgeous.
296525 299524 It's fabulous,<br />absolutely fabulous.
305566 308565 Now altogether... one, two, three.
311191 312732 Well done!
316691 318274 Happy Christmas!
319691 321274 I love you.
322608 325899 <i>You will think that we ought<br />to have been very happy</i>
326025 328940 <i>and we were but we did not know<br />how happy</i>
329066 332399 <i>till the pretty life at Edgecombe Villa<br />was over and done with</i>
332525 335940 <i>and we had to live<br />a very different life indeed.</i>
336066 338357 Peter my boy, come here.
349191 351899 Dad... it's perfect.
352025 355982 It's more perfect<br />than any one could ever dream of.
357816 360399 Thank you, Dad.
361358 364940 <i>The dreadful change<br />came quite suddenly.</i>
382025 383524 You heaving brute!
384525 387940 <i>And that was the last we saw<br />of poor Potts.</i>
389066 391399 What a wreck!
391525 393149 - Is there any hope?<br />- Hope?
393275 397149 Of course, it'll want hope yes,<br />and a new valve.
397275 399732 I'll tell you what, I'll give up<br />Saturday afternoon to it.
399858 401357 Yes, and you can help me.
403275 405899 I hate doing a job like this<br />especially at Christmas.
406025 407565 Who on earth is that?
407691 411649 An Englishman's house is his castle, but<br />I wish they had moats and drawbridges!
413025 414524 Come in.
415816 417149 Yes?
417275 419899 Please, sir. There are two gentlemen<br />wish to see you.
420025 423690 I've shown them into the study, sir,<br />I hope that was all right?
425191 427065 Excuse me.
442358 444815 I wish we did have<br />a moat and drawbridge.
444941 446565 Then if we didn't want anyone to...
446691 450232 I've never heard anything<br />so preposterous. When? Who?
450358 452482 - Why's Daddy shouting?<br />- I don't know, dear.
452608 454024 Come in.
455941 456982 Yes, Ruth?
460150 461149 What is it?
461275 465940 Please, ma'am, the Master wants you<br />to just step into the study.
482275 487565 Look, I'm not going to say a thing!
489400 491232 Come in.
491358 492940 I will not!
568150 570524 All right, cabby,<br />Scotland Yard.
596733 598107 It's bed-time.
598233 600190 Ruth will put you to bed.
600316 604065 But you promised we could stay up late.<br />Daddy was going to play with us.
604191 607690 Father's been<br />called away... on business.
607816 609357 Go up at once darlings, please.
621066 623565 It wasn't bad news,<br />was it, Mummy?
623691 626399 Is anyone dead or...
626525 629149 Oh, no, nobody's dead.
629275 631982 I can't tell you anything about it tonight.<br />Up you go.
651108 655357 96... 97... 98... 99... 100.
665025 667524 Well, good night then.
672691 675857 Ruth!
675983 677482 What's up?
677608 680399 Ask me no questions<br />and I'll tell you no lies.
680525 682024 You'll know soon enough.
713358 716190 - Phyl?<br />- Yes.
716316 720815 If Mother doesn't want us to know<br />she's been crying then we won't know.
720941 723982 - That's all.<br />- All right.
732441 735649 She's gone into London,<br />that's all I know.
735775 738399 Now just you eat up.
740275 745065 Some dire calamity's happening,<br />I just know it.
763150 766065 Good evening, Mrs. Waterbury.
775608 777815 - Good evening, ma'am.<br />- Good evening, Sally.
777941 782482 Oh, it's so cold!<br />Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on.
783608 786524 My darlings, those men last night<br />did bring very bad news
786650 788315 and Father will be away<br />for some time
788441 790690 Is it something to do<br />with the Government, Mummy?
790816 792065 Yes... yes, it is.
794108 796482 Now it's bed time, my darlings.
801358 805274 And don't worry.<br />It will all come right in the end.
805400 809565 Don't you worry either<br />because we'll be as good as gold.
816483 821607 Oh, we used to say life was so dull...<br />Nothing ever happened like in books.
821733 823232 Now something has happened.
823358 827690 Yes, it has<br />and it's made Mother unhappy.
829358 831690 Everything's horrid...
831816 833357 ...just horrid.
834275 836357 Stairs... stairs... stairs...
836483 839899 <i>Everything continued to be<br />perfectly horrid for some weeks.</i>
840025 841565 <i>Mother was nearly always out,</i>
841691 844982 <i>the between maid was sent away...</i>
852358 855065 <i>...and Aunt Emma<br />came on a visit.</i>
872150 875940 - Good afternoon, children.<br />- Good afternoon, Aunt Emma.
876066 879065 Your mother has sent for me<br />in her distress,
879191 882024 and I'm here for a while<br />but not for long.
882150 884399 I'm off to India as a governess
884525 887149 and as I shall be busy preparing<br />for my arduous journey,
887275 891399 I shall require you to be seen<br />and not heard.
891525 893732 Preferably to be not seen<br />and not heard.
893858 897232 Children should be kept<br />in their proper places.
897358 899774 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes, Aunt Emma.
899900 903274 - Yes, Aunt Emma.<br />- Excellent.
903400 905357 You may kiss me<br />if you wish.
912525 915065 # You can hear them sigh<br />and wish to die
915191 917065 # You can see them wink<br />the other eye
917191 920815 # At the man who broke<br />the Bank at Monte Carlo
920941 921982 Altogether now
922108 926065 # As I walked along the Bois Boulogne<br />with an inde... #
926191 929940 I have asked you not to use them utensils<br />in that manner.
930066 932065 I was up at four this morning<br />cleaning them
932191 934899 as if I haven't got enough to do<br />what with the between maid leaving
935025 938399 and now your aunt asking me<br />to heave bloomin' great boxes about
938525 939940 like I was a navvy or something.
940066 942190 - Ruth.<br />- Yes?
942316 946524 There's no need to be so rude.<br />Cook was just trying to cheer us up.
946650 948732 Come on, you two.
953400 955107 Well...
956691 960607 I'm very surprised at you, Cook.<br />Where's your dignity?
960733 962315 And take that silly hat off.
962441 964065 Get yourself dressed properly.
964191 966274 I don't know I seem to do<br />all the work round here.
968566 971565 We shouldn't really Peter,<br />she'll get soaked.
971691 973690 It's too late, she's coming.
974816 976690 Stairs... stairs... stairs...
976816 978857 I'll have fallen arches<br />before me holiday.
978983 981107 I hope you're undressed and ready,<br />master Peter.
981233 982690 I haven't got all night, you know.
982816 985357 - Yes, Ruth.<br />- Good...
985483 986857 Oh!
986983 988357 Oh... ugh!
990191 992315 You...!
1018441 1021065 - Oh! Stop it!<br />- You nasty little limb, you!
1021191 1023732 If you don't mend your ways
1023858 1028357 you'll go where your precious<br />father's gone, so I tell you straight.
1028483 1030815 Ruth!
1036816 1038399 Huh!
1058025 1060399 We're going to have to play<br />at being poor for a while.
1060525 1064190 We're moving to a darling little house<br />in the country, up in Yorkshire.
1064316 1067065 - What?<br />- I know you'll love it
1067191 1072190 - Is Aunt Emma coming?<br />- No, Peter, unfortunately not.
1076358 1079190 - Don't you want a 1st Class, madam?<br />- No, Second. Thank you.
1079316 1081190 Ah, looked like 1st Class quality to me.
1081316 1083440 - Are we on the right train for Yorkshire?<br />- Yes.
1083566 1084607 Thank you.
1125941 1128774 Ooh... careful.<br />Give that to me.
1135400 1139482 - I'll take that bag.<br />- Thank you so much.
1139608 1141190 - Goodbye.<br />- Thank you. Goodbye.
1142733 1143774 Excuse me.
1146316 1148982 We want to go to the house on the hill.<br />The Three Chimneys.
1149108 1152357 - Er, do you know the way?<br />- I daresay.
1152483 1156649 - Well, will you show us?<br />- I daresay.
1156775 1158524 Ay... oop!
1165566 1166815 Ow!
1166941 1168565 - Phyllis, are you all right?<br />- Yes.
1168691 1170815 Can't we put just one box<br />on your cart?
1170941 1175482 You asked me to show you the way,<br />nothing was said about boxes.
1175608 1177899 Never mind, darlings.<br />It's only a few more yards.
1178025 1180107 Whoa!
1192025 1194482 I wonder why she didn't leave<br />the lights on.
1194608 1195982 Who is she?
1196108 1199440 Mrs. Viney, The woman I engaged<br />to clean the place and to get the supper.
1199566 1201940 I expect Mrs. Viney's gone home.
1202066 1204607 Your train was late, see.
1205275 1207149 But she's got the key.<br />What do we do?
1207275 1209690 She'll have left that<br />under the doorstep.
1209816 1213982 - We all do hereabouts.<br />- Well you might have said so.
1214108 1215607 You never asked, did you?
1215733 1217940 Nothing was said<br />about a door key.
1218066 1221940 - May I borrow your lamp, please?<br />- I daresay.
1223983 1227982 If you say "I daresay" once more,<br />I shall have hysterics, I daresay
1230191 1232690 Oh... there we are.
1248691 1249732 What's that?
1253275 1256149 It's only the rats.
1268775 1274524 God works in mysterious ways<br />his wonders to perform.
1283108 1285232 - Ow!<br />- Rats!
1285358 1289315 - I wish we hadn't come.<br />- Don't you worry, darlings.
1289441 1294482 I saw a paraffin lamp on the table,<br />we'll soon have some light.
1294608 1298565 Oh, those poor little mice,<br />they were so frightened.
1298691 1301815 I don't believe they were rats at all.
1302775 1306399 You've often said you wanted<br />something to happen, well now it has.
1306525 1308899 It's quite exciting, isn't it?
1309025 1311357 I told Mrs. Viney to get<br />some meat and bread
1311483 1314940 and have some supper ready.<br />I wonder where...
1315066 1317149 Oh, I suppose she's laid it<br />in the dining room.
1317275 1320190 Come along darlings, up here.<br />Let's go and see.
1321316 1322815 Come along.
1326316 1330857 Oh darlings, mind the steps.<br />Mind how you go, Peter.
1334483 1336065 Oh!
1342150 1344024 Oh, that beastly woman!
1344150 1346232 She's taken the money<br />and not left us any food.
1346358 1349607 Aren't we going to have<br />any supper tonight? I'm starving!
1349733 1352149 I know! There's some food<br />in the cases in the cellar.
1352275 1356315 Aunt Emma sent them on<br />ahead of us. Come along.
1357025 1358690 Mind the step.
1365525 1367565 Come along, Bobbie,<br />it's a real feast.
1367691 1369815 Sardines, biscuits, ginger.
1369941 1371440 Raisins...
1371566 1374899 No Phyl, no! You do not put<br />the marmalade spoon in to the sardines.
1375025 1376815 Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy.
1376941 1379565 Tell you what,<br />let's drink Aunt Emma's health.
1379691 1382399 - Good idea.<br />- Here's to Aunt Emma.
1382525 1384399 - To Aunt Emma.<br />- Aunt Emma.
1384525 1386815 And all who sail in her.
1394566 1397232 - Oh! What's that, Mummy?<br />- Pie.
1397358 1400149 - Pie?<br />- Apple Pie.
1400275 1403024 Apple pie for breakfast?<br />Then we're not poor after all.
1403150 1404899 This is the supper<br />we should have had.
1405025 1407732 I found it in that little room<br />that we thought was a cupboard,
1407858 1411024 so Mrs. Viney wasn't so bad<br />after all.
1420775 1424357 - Good morning, can I help you?<br />- I expect so. Viney's the name.
1424483 1426815 Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus.
1426941 1430190 Do come in.<br />We're just been talking about you.
1430316 1434024 Oh, I see you found your supper then.<br />Funny time to have it though.
1477816 1479607 It was like a great dragon<br />tearing by.
1479733 1482815 A dragon's house<br />looks like that tunnel.
1482941 1485190 I never thought we'd ever get so near<br />to a train as this.
1485316 1488607 - It's better than toy engines, isn't it?<br />- I don't know, it's different.
1488733 1492232 It seems so odd to see all of a train.<br />It's so tall.
1492358 1494815 I've always seen them cut<br />in half by platforms
1494941 1498024 I wonder if that train's going to London?<br />London is where Daddy is.
1498150 1500565 - We don't know that, Phyl.<br />- He might be.
1575691 1577190 Oh! Ahem.
1578066 1579190 - How do you do?<br />- Eh?
1579316 1580357 - How do you do?<br />- Yes.
1580483 1583232 - Could I ask you two questions?<br />- Yes, well it depends what they are.
1583358 1585649 I can't spend all day conversationalising<br />with the junior public.
1585775 1587232 Now what are they?
1587358 1589607 What's the white mark<br />on the coal heap for?
1589733 1592440 That's to tell you how much coal there is<br />you see, in case anybody nicks it.
1592566 1593607 Second question, please.
1593733 1595649 Do you know anything<br />about engines?
1595775 1597607 Do I know anything about engines?<br />Why?
1597733 1600315 - Because I've got one.<br />- Er, what gauge?
1600441 1604024 I don't know anything about gauges,<br />but it's about this big.
1604150 1605190 Yes?
1605316 1607857 - It's brass and it blew up.<br />- It blew up.
1607983 1610065 Well just excuse me young man,<br />I've got a lot to do
1610191 1612649 cos the Station Master's<br />having his hair cut in Leeds, you see
1612775 1614190 and Perks must be about it.
1614316 1618565 - Perks? Who's Perks?<br />- Me, sir. I'm Perks.
1635983 1637107 Right on time.
1637233 1642190 - What is?<br />- This ere's the Scots Flyer.
1653941 1657065 Why is it going so slowly,<br />Mr. Perks?
1658733 1663315 Why... well it's all up hill<br />to Scotland, isn't it?
1665983 1668024 That train's going to Scotland.
1668150 1670190 If Daddy's not in London,<br />he's in Scotland
1670316 1671815 and that train is going to Scotland.
1673858 1675982 Perhaps, Phyl.
1680816 1683982 I don't think we're going to enjoy<br />being poor, you know,
1684108 1686524 being cold and all that.
1688150 1691607 Phyllis, try to imagine it<br />as an adventure.
1691733 1694940 All sorts of things might happen.
1695066 1697065 Mother could write about it.
1697191 1700690 Write a book.<br />You never know.
1700816 1704190 We won't always be poor, Phyllis,<br />I'm sure.
1704316 1706690 All right. Good night.
1708733 1710315 Good night.
1713275 1715524 I'm still cold though.
1715650 1718482 ...lightly on the-cheek.
1720275 1724732 ...one of the men, in a bowler hat,<br />opened the door...
1724858 1729482 Father did not turn,<br />but left without a word.
1744483 1747232 Why don't we ask the next train<br />to take our love to Daddy?
1747358 1750274 Trains don't carry people's love,<br />they'd be above that.
1750400 1752065 Yes, they do if you tame them first.
1752191 1754107 I wonder why Daddy<br />hasn't written to us.
1754233 1757107 Mummy says he's too busy.<br />he'll write soon, she says.
1758525 1761232 Well, why don't we wave anyway?<br />Three waves won't matter.
1761358 1763274 We won't miss them.
1787691 1789315 Charming...
1789816 1791399 Charming!
1841525 1843065 About time they had it seen to.
1847025 1849190 The coal in the little shed<br />has held out well, Bobbie.
1849316 1851857 There was hardly any there yesterday<br />when I looked.
1851983 1853440 Well, we've only had one fire.
1853566 1858190 I know but I could swear there's more<br />than when we first came.
1858316 1884524 - That's silly.<br />- Course it's silly.
1884650 1887899 So it's you, Pete.
1888025 1890982 - It's you.<br />- It's me what?
1891108 1893565 It's you that's been putting<br />the coal in the shed.
1893691 1895607 But where from Pete,<br />for heaven's sake?
1895733 1898482 From the coal heap of course,<br />they've got stacks of it there.
1898608 1902607 But that's stealing!<br />Don't you remember your catechism?
1902733 1904607 "Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"
1904733 1907065 It wasn't stealing.<br />It was mining.
1907191 1909899 I took from the top.<br />That's mining, not stealing.
1910025 1912107 If it was, all the miners in the world<br />would be in jug.
1912233 1914899 Oh, Pete... Pete!
1915025 1917274 Oh Pete, Pete.
1917400 1919190 We'll have to take it all back.
1919316 1921232 - What?<br />- All of it.
1921358 1923065 - All of it.<br />- All of it!
1923191 1924690 All of it.
1925983 1929149 There can't be anything wrong in trying<br />to keep your own mother warm.
1929275 1930857 That can't be wrong.
1930983 1933357 It's all right Pete,<br />at least we can burn the evidence.
1944275 1946357 Mrs. Viney, here we are.<br />I've got the buns for tea.
1946483 1949482 - Buns?<br />- Yes, Mummy sold a story and...
1949608 1951232 Mrs. Viney, what's the matter?
1951358 1955149 It's your dear ma, master Peter,<br />she's... she's very poorly.
1955275 1957649 You'd better go back to the village<br />and get Dr. Forrest.
1957775 1959690 Right.
1959816 1961774 Don't let her die, Mrs. Viney.
1972691 1974732 Doctor Forrest!
1974858 1976399 Ahem!
1980733 1982815 Mother's very ill,<br />please come quickly,
1982941 1984857 Stay there, my boy.
2016191 2018107 Influenza.
2018775 2020690 But not serious.
2022691 2026440 Now my Lady Grave-airs,<br />I suppose you'll want to be head nurse?
2026566 2028357 - Of course, Doctor.<br />- Right.
2028483 2031065 Now we'll send down some medicine.<br />Keep a good fire going
2031191 2033065 and have some strong beef tea<br />ready to give her
2033191 2035190 the moment the fever goes down...
2035316 2037399 She can have the grapes now<br />and the soda water.
2037525 2039857 Oh, and you'd better get<br />a bottle of brandy.
2039983 2042065 You can go in now...
2042983 2045065 May I have the list?
2048525 2050607 Don't worry, funny face.
2050733 2053940 She's head nurse<br />but you can be Matron.
2054066 2055857 Oh, thank you.
2055983 2059524 Oh, what utter nonsense,<br />I can't afford all that.
2059650 2063482 I haven't an idea in my head<br />for a story
2063608 2067274 so there won't even be buns<br />for tea for some time.
2067400 2072690 Tell Mrs. Viney to boil some scrag-end<br />of neck for your dinner tomorrow
2072816 2075065 then I'll have some of the broth.
2076525 2078940 But even if we never have<br />anything to eat at all
2079066 2081190 you can't afford all those other things.
2081316 2085649 Right. So we've got to think<br />of some other way.
2085775 2088232 Now everybody, think.
2088358 2090315 Just as hard as ever you can,
2090441 2091982 think!
2093108 2095190 - I, O, N.<br />- You sure?
2095316 2096815 Yes.
2098191 2099732 I...
2100483 2102024 O...
2105358 2108399 N.<br />There. Brilliant.
2108525 2110190 "Look out at the station."
2110316 2112982 Definitely one of your best works,<br />Michael Angelo.
2145691 2148940 Oakworth Station!<br />Oakworth!
2150150 2152190 Oakworth!
2154566 2157065 Oakworth Station.
2161483 2163357 Oh, I thought I'd missed you.
2163483 2165274 You are the man who waves to us,<br />aren't you?
2165400 2166940 - Mind the doors, please.<br />- Aren't you?
2167066 2169274 - Yes my dear, I wave...<br />- Oh, will you take this, please.
2169400 2171482 We chose you because we thought<br />you had such a kind face.
2171608 2174607 Er, mind the doors please, Miss.<br />Sir. On the way, Mr., Mitchell.
2174733 2176274 Thank you, Mr. Perks.
2250816 2252399 - Good evening.<br />- Good evening.
2252525 2253565 Good evening.
2253691 2258065 Oh dear!<br />Oh! Good evening.
2258191 2260607 The name's Perks.<br />I believe we've met.
2260733 2263649 Yes, you were busy’cause of<br />the Station Master being in Leeds.
2263775 2266565 Yes, even busier now<br />'cause he had a drop too much
2266691 2271190 down at the Britannia Arms and fell over<br />and broke his daft leg playing billiards.
2271316 2273065 - Of course it was his own fault.<br />- Why?
2273191 2274815 He should've used the rest.
2274941 2276857 He will do that<br />over the edge, you see.
2276983 2279357 The old gent asked me<br />to fetch this up straight away.
2279483 2280690 Thank you very much, Mr. Perks.
2280816 2283815 I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence<br />to give you like Father does, but...
2283941 2288482 Hey! Just stop that, please.<br />I wasn't thinking about no tuppences.
2288608 2292024 I just came to say I was sorry<br />to hear your mama wasn't so well
2292150 2294065 and to ask how she finds herself<br />this evening.
2295108 2298815 Oh and I've er, I brought her<br />a bit of sweet briar.
2298941 2300940 It's very sweet to smell that is.
2301733 2302815 Tuppence indeed.
2302941 2305565 Thank you very much and I beg<br />your pardon about the twopence.
2305691 2307315 No offences, I'm sure.<br />No offence.
2307441 2309940 And just to show I'll er,<br />I'll have a look
2310066 2312399 at that blown up brass engine<br />of yourn, shall I?
2312525 2314399 - What?<br />- Yes.
2316066 2319690 Oh, can you manage?<br />Bit heavy... Here you are.
2321358 2323357 Oh. Is that it?
2324816 2330524 Bit of a mess, isn't it?<br />Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do.
2330650 2332690 - Good evening.<br />- Thank you, Mr. Perks. Good night.
2343691 2347107 - Oh!<br />- Oh, look at that!
2348316 2350524 Oh, everything...
2353108 2354940 "Dear Roberta, Phyllis<br />and Peter,
2355066 2357190 "here are the things you want.
2357316 2359565 "Your mother will want to know<br />where they came from
2359691 2361357 "so please ask her to forgive me
2361483 2364690 "for taking the liberty<br />of allowing myself the great pleasure.
2364816 2369190 "Yours sincerely, G. P... Something."<br />I can't read it.
2369316 2371982 I think we were right to ask him.
2372108 2373649 Right? Of course we're right.
2373775 2376857 I don't fancy telling Mother<br />the whole truth about this.
2376983 2379357 We shouldn't do that<br />until she's completely well.
2379483 2381982 And when she is, we'll be so happy<br />we shan't mind the fuss.
2382108 2384357 Oh, look at those roses!
2384483 2386982 I'll take them up to her.
2389066 2393607 - And the sweetbriar.<br />- Oh, thank you.
2393733 2395857 Cor, look!<br />I wonder what's in there.
2415858 2418982 So that's an end to it! Now listen.<br />It's true, we're poor,
2419108 2422940 but we shall have enough to live on<br />as long as I have ideas for stories.
2424108 2428399 But you mustn't go about telling people<br />of our affairs. It isn't right!
2428525 2433357 And you must never, never, never<br />ask strangers to give you things.
2433483 2434524 Always remember that.
2434650 2436524 - Yes, Mother.<br />- I shall write to your old gentleman
2436650 2438565 and I shall tell him<br />that I didn't approve.
2438691 2440899 I shall thank him too,<br />of course, for his kindness,
2441025 2444565 but it you that I don't approve of,<br />not the old gentleman.
2444691 2447232 He's been extremely kind.
2447358 2451482 You can give my letter to your Mr. Perks<br />to give to him.
2453608 2456274 And we won't say any more about it.
2458191 2460357 Isn't she marvellous<br />when she's angry?
2479525 2481482 Whoa!
2481608 2482690 Hello, head-nurse.
2482816 2487190 That's funny, I was thinking about you.<br />I wanted to talk to you, Doctor.
2487316 2491565 - Your mother's not worse I hope?<br />- No, but...
2491691 2494357 Come on, we'll go for a ride.
2519358 2520899 This is great fun.
2521025 2523690 Come on, out with it, head-nurse.<br />What's the trouble?
2523816 2528065 It's rather hard, you see, to’out with it'<br />because of what Mother said.
2528191 2529732 What did Mother say?
2529858 2533065 She said I wasn't to go telling everyone<br />that we're poor.
2533191 2537732 - But you aren't everyone, are you?<br />- Not at all. Well?
2537858 2540232 Well, I know doctors<br />are very expensive
2540358 2543982 and Mrs. Viney told me that her doctor<br />only cost her twopence a week
2544108 2547065 - because she belonged to a club.<br />- Yes.
2547191 2549232 Well, could we join<br />your club too, please?
2549358 2551482 The same as Mr. Viney.
2551608 2553232 You aren't cross with me, are you?
2553358 2556857 Cross? How could I be?<br />You're a very sensible little woman.
2556983 2559690 Now don't you worry.<br />I'll make it all right with your mother,
2559816 2562649 even if I have to make<br />a special brand-new club just for her.
2562775 2564357 Whoa!
2566483 2568315 Thank you.
2575691 2578232 Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up<br />in here.
2578358 2579982 Here's a new ribbon for you.
2581191 2583065 There, the surprise is ready.
2583191 2585440 When the bell rings again<br />you can come into the dining room.
2585566 2587149 Come on, Pete.
2592775 2594690 Of course.
2631858 2633815 Happy birthday.
2667275 2669357 Happy birthday, head-nurse.
2679358 2681732 Happy birthday, Miss Roberta.
2689150 2691190 My darling.
2701608 2703690 I helped to make it.
2709275 2712232 Happy birthday, Lanky.
2712358 2716940 # She was beautiful as a butterfly
2717066 2719482 # Proud as a queen
2719608 2722815 # Was pretty little Polly Perkins
2722941 2725607 # Of Paddington Green #
2726775 2729690 - Many happy returns.<br />- Thank you.
2731191 2733107 Lanky indeed!
2734275 2735815 Fatty.
2735941 2738982 - Hope you enjoy the cake.<br />- It's lovely. Thank you very much.
2739108 2742815 - Have a lovely party, my dear.<br />- Thank you for coming.
2743525 2745565 Thank you.
2750691 2753107 Wouldn't Daddy have loved this?
2762733 2764982 Thank you very much,<br />Mrs. Waterbury.
2765108 2768732 Good night, good night.
2768858 2773315 Happy birthday!<br />Hey, happy birthday!
2828025 2830565 I hope Mother doesn't get too wet<br />in Wakefield.
2830691 2832565 We don't want her ill again.
2832691 2834232 It's like being in a besieged castle,
2834358 2838399 the arrows of the foe striking<br />against the battlements.
2838525 2841565 No, it's more<br />like a great big garden-squirt.
2841691 2843940 - You're a great big garden squirt<br />- Thank you.
2844066 2846274 Stop it you two!<br />There's a train coming.
2866191 2869607 Oakworth! Oakworth Station!<br />Oakworth!
2869733 2871232 Oakworth Station!
2871358 2873565 Come on. Don't mind the rain,<br />it's only a shower.
2873691 2874732 That's it, thank you.
2875525 2878732 Mind the doors, please.<br />Mind the doors now.
2878858 2880899 Mind the doors, come on.
2881025 2883524 Right away, Mr. Mainprice
2885983 2888607 Mother should be on the next train<br />in about fifteen minutes.
2888733 2891149 That one was from London, I think.
2891275 2893607 Hey, there's something going<br />at the end of the station.
2893733 2895357 Yes, something's happened,<br />come on.
2895483 2898149 If you ask me this is a case<br />for the police courts.
2898275 2900357 No, the infirmary more like.
2900483 2903274 Let me pass please, will you?<br />I'll deal with this if you please.
2906275 2909274 - What's he say?<br />- Sounds like French to me.
2909400 2911107 I was in Calais once for a day.
2911233 2915399 - That's not French.<br />- Well what is it then if it's not French?
2915525 2918065 I don't know.<br />It's not French, I know that.
2920816 2924065 No, that's not French.<br />Nothing like it.
2924191 2927899 Try him with French if you know<br />so much then, clever dick.
2928025 2931399 Parlez vous français, Monsieur?
2931525 2935190 Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci!<br />Enfin un amis.
2935316 2938899 Mon petit vous ne soures jamais<br />combien je suis content.
2939025 2941690 - Now that's French.<br />- What's he say?
2941816 2942899 I don't know...
2943025 2944565 Yes, well all right everybody.
2944691 2947232 Keep moving along, please.<br />I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you.
2949108 2950857 All right now, now, now...<br />Go on.
2950983 2952940 Take him into the waiting room.<br />Mother can talk French.
2953066 2954315 She's on the next train<br />from Wakefield.
2954441 2956565 Right. Come on.
2960108 2963024 He thinks you're a policeman.<br />He thinks you're going to shut him up.
2963150 2965565 I know he does.<br />Look at his eyes.
2965691 2968982 They're like a fox's eyes<br />when the beast is in a trap.
2971275 2974857 Vous attendre.<br />Ma mere parlez français.
2974983 2977065 Nous...
2977191 2982232 - What's "being kind"?<br />- Er, "bon" is good.
2982358 2985524 Nous sommes bon<br />pour vous, Monsieur.
2992983 2997357 Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at<br />the Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it.
2999858 3002982 C'est bon.<br />Ma mere arrive, c'est bon.
3003108 3004399 Je vous aide.
3004525 3006565 Look I'm not sure<br />we oughtn't to send for police.
3006691 3008565 - Don't!<br />- Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes.
3008691 3010732 She speaks French beautifully.<br />You'd love to hear her.
3010858 3013440 I'm sure he hasn't done anything<br />like you're sent to prison for.
3013566 3017065 Yes, well he looks<br />without visible means to me.
3017191 3019857 Still I don't mind waiting<br />till your mama comes.
3019983 3022899 I'd like to know what country<br />has got the credit of him.
3023025 3025399 Look, I've got an idea.<br />Foreign stamps.
3025525 3026982 We'll show them these.
3027108 3032482 Regardes les stamps.<br />Quelle patrie?
3032608 3035482 Ah... Ruskie...
3036608 3038940 - Ruskie.<br />- My lord, he's Russian.
3039066 3041232 Yeah, I-I thought he was.
3048733 3050232 I'll wait here<br />till you bring Mummy in.
3050358 3051940 Not afraid?
3052066 3053482 No.
3056816 3060565 Oakworth Station! Mrs. Waterbury,<br />I have something to tell you.
3060691 3063357 - Mummy, we found a Russian.<br />- There's a fellow in there, he's Russian.
3063483 3065482 Close the doors.<br />Right away, Guard!
3065608 3067482 You wouldn't hurt me, would you?
3071525 3075149 Hello, Bobbie.<br />Qui est vous?
3075275 3078690 Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky.
3079483 3083065 Oh, it's all right.<br />Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest.
3083191 3085565 - We'll take him home with us, Mr. Perks.<br />- Thank you, Madam.
3085691 3089065 Come on, help him on the other side.<br />Don't worry.
3089191 3093190 Don't worry, she'll look after you.
3093316 3094732 I knew he was a Russian.
3098358 3099357 Doctor.
3100525 3104065 I need to tell you.<br />Mother's got a very shabby Russian.
3104191 3105732 Your mother's got<br />a very shabby what?
3105858 3109065 He'll have to join your club.<br />I'm certain he hasn't any money.
3109191 3111565 We found him at the station.
3111691 3113940 - Found him? Was he lost then?<br />- Yes, that's what he was.
3114066 3116607 He's been telling Mother<br />life story in French.
3116733 3118774 She said would you please<br />come directly.
3118900 3120565 He's got a nasty cough
3120691 3122190 and he's been crying.
3123941 3125107 Oh, don't smile.
3126025 3127065 Please don't.
3127191 3130024 You wouldn't if you'd seen him.
3130150 3132232 I've never seen a man cry before.
3132358 3135774 Haven't you?<br />I do it all the time.
3188858 3190399 Bobbie!
3191025 3194649 I know you said<br />we weren't to ask any questions
3194775 3197649 but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he?
3197775 3201482 Oh, my darling, no.
3201608 3204065 Bobbie, look at me.
3204191 3208065 Daddy was quite, quite well<br />when I heard from him last
3208191 3210399 and he'll come back to us<br />some day.
3218316 3220024 Do tell us about the Russian.
3220691 3224732 That can't make a long story, my darling,<br />because I'm very tired.
3224858 3228690 He's a very clever writer,<br />but in Russia one dare not say
3228816 3231440 anything about the rich people<br />doing wrong
3231566 3233399 or what ought to be done<br />for the poor.
3233525 3235440 If one does, one is sent to prison.
3235566 3238732 Well he wrote a book about it all
3238858 3241607 and he was three years in a dungeon.
3241733 3245065 No light, damp and dreadful.
3245191 3247649 Then they took him out<br />and they sent him to Siberia
3247775 3250190 and he was condemned<br />to stay there for life.
3250316 3253899 - For life? For writing a book?<br />- That's stupid.
3254025 3256399 Go on, Mama.
3256525 3259649 While he was at the mines,<br />some friends got a message to him
3259775 3263440 to say that his wife and children<br />had escaped to England.
3263566 3268274 So after many adventures he too escaped<br />and came here to look for them.
3268400 3272357 - Do you think he will find them?<br />- Oh, I do hope so.
3273191 3275690 I think my darlings, in your prayers<br />you might ask God
3275816 3279690 to show his pity<br />upon all prisoners and captives.
3280525 3283940 To show his pity<br />upon all prisoners and captives?
3285608 3288857 Yes, darling.<br />Upon all the prisoners and captives.
3301691 3303274 Merci.
3309441 3312482 He seemed pleased. I wish we could think<br />of other things to give him.
3312608 3314274 What about strawberries?
3314400 3317982 Perks promised me some<br />from his own garden ages ago.
3344108 3345607 Look at that tree over there!
3350358 3351940 Lor, it's moving!
3354358 3355732 So are the others...
3360066 3362149 It's magic.
3362275 3367857 What is it?
3371941 3376190 It's much too magic for me.<br />I don't like it, I'm going home.
3404025 3406399 Cor, that'll take some sweeping up.
3427691 3429899 Hey! The 11:29 down<br />hasn't gone by yet.
3430025 3432232 We must let them know at the station,<br />there'll be an accident.
3432358 3433649 - Let's run!<br />- No, come back.
3433775 3435690 It's too late, it's two miles away.
3435816 3439565 - We do something to the telegraph wires.<br />- But we don't know how.
3444858 3447607 If we only had something red, we could<br />go down on to the line and wave it.
3447733 3450440 But the train wouldn't see us till it came<br />round the corner. That's too late.
3450566 3452440 We could go round<br />and wave to the train.
3452566 3454190 We might wave anyway.
3454316 3457732 No. They'd only think it was us as usual,<br />we've waved so often before.
3457858 3459940 - Flannel petticoats!<br />- I beg your pardon?
3460066 3463357 - Flannel petticoats.<br />- Of course! Take them off.
3476191 3479274 - Now.<br />- You're not going to tear them, Pete?
3479400 3482399 - Oh, shut up<br />- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.
3482525 3486565 If we can't stop the train,<br />there'll be an accident with people killed.
3486691 3488565 Now sticks, come on.
3512191 3515399 - I'll have two. It was my idea.<br />- They're our petticoats!
3515525 3519107 What's it matter who waves what<br />if we can only stop the train.
3523775 3525690 Stand firm and wave like mad.
3529316 3530774 Keep off the line, Bobbie.
3534275 3536607 They won't see us.<br />It's all no good.
3538483 3541524 - Stand off the line, Bobbie.<br />- It's all no good.
3541650 3546690 - Stand back!<br />- Not yet. Not yet!
3549858 3551815 - Stop!<br />- Stop!
3553733 3554774 Stop!
3566900 3569232 - Stand back.<br />- Stop!
3569358 3571399 Stop!
3571525 3573524 - Stop!<br />- Stop!
3573650 3577190 Stop.
3579483 3581399 Stop...
3582650 3584065 Stop.
3588816 3592565 Stop. There's been an earthquake.<br />Don't move you'll all be killed.
3592691 3597815 The trees are walking down the bank<br />and there's a mountain of great stones.
3613525 3617357 We'll have a look at this earthquake<br />then get back to the train.
3620150 3622607 Bobbie.
3622733 3626274 Ladies and gentlemen, I think<br />you'll agree with me that we have three
3626400 3632482 charming children here<br />who are indeed an example to us all.
3636066 3638440 All right chaps, this is it.
3638566 3640774 One, two, three.
3648483 3653440 ...I have learned<br />in the short time I have seen them
3653566 3655982 to look forward to knowing them better.
3656108 3658607 If I had to rename the Waterbury children,
3658733 3663482 I would call them<br />the Three Saviours of the Steel Road
3663608 3665065 or perhaps the Railway Children.
3665191 3669815 And now my dears, from the directors<br />of the Northern and Southern Railway
3669941 3675190 in grateful recognition<br />of a courageous and brave action
3675316 3677524 which averted an accident
3677650 3681440 on August 15th, 1905.
3681566 3683690 Oh, thank you.
3703608 3706274 It's your turn now.<br />Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen".
3706400 3709982 - Oh, lor!<br />- No, "Ladies and gentlemen".
3710108 3712274 Ladies and gentlemen...
3713358 3715024 Ladies and gentlemen,
3715150 3719232 we shall treasure these watches<br />for the rest of our lives.
3719358 3722482 What I mean to say is,<br />thank you all very much indeed.
3727316 3729190 One, two.
3745316 3747982 You must be very proud,<br />Mrs. Waterbury.
3748108 3750732 And er, this is from me.
3799191 3803107 It was a wonderful day, wasn't it?<br />The kind that very seldom happens.
3803233 3806899 But I did so want to talk to<br />the old gentleman about something else.
3807025 3808690 What did you want<br />to say to him?
3808816 3811774 I'll tell you,<br />I've written him a letter.
3814483 3818065 "My dearest old gentleman,<br />I want to ask you something, please.
3818191 3821399 "If you get out of the train<br />and go by the next it would do.
3821525 3825399 "I do not want you to give me anything -<br />Mother says we ought not to.
3825525 3830565 "Besides, we only want to talk to you<br />about a prisoner and captive.
3830691 3832190 "Your loving friend, Bobbie."
3832316 3835399 Very good.<br />Yes, it is.
3847983 3853024 My heart's thumping like a steam engine,<br />right under my sash, too.
3853150 3855232 People's hearts<br />aren't under their sashes.
3855358 3856899 I don't care, mine is.
3857025 3860940 If you're going to talk like a poetry book,<br />my heart's in my mouth.
3861066 3863607 My heart's in my boots<br />if it comes to that.
3863733 3866190 - He'll think we're idiots.<br />- He won't be far wrong.
3866316 3869107 Oakworth!
3872150 3875107 - Morning, sir.<br />- Good morning, Perks.
3876066 3880232 - Hello. This is a very great pleasure.<br />- It was good of you to get out.
3880358 3883232 Er, may I extend a cordial invitation<br />to the use of my room, sir?
3883358 3884399 - Thank you.<br />- Right away, sir.
3884525 3886857 - Right away, Mr. Mitchell.<br />- Thank you, Mr. Perks.
3886983 3889774 If you'd care to follow me, sir<br />just along here.
3897066 3899399 - Nice and tidy for you sir.<br />- Ah, thank you, Perks.
3899525 3902690 - I'll leave you to it then, sir.<br />- Thank you.
3904733 3906315 Well?
3909066 3912149 Well?<br />What is it?
3915108 3918024 - Oh, please...<br />- Yes?
3918150 3921274 - What I mean to say is...<br />- Yes?
3921400 3925690 - I wish I might say something.<br />- I wish you would say something.
3925816 3928940 Well then... it's about our Russian.
3929691 3931482 - Captive.<br />- A captive.
3931608 3935149 We want more than anything in the world<br />to find his wife and children for him.
3935275 3936524 Only we don't know how.
3937358 3940274 - What did you say his name was?<br />- I'll write it for you.
3943066 3946565 Um, would you have a pencil<br />and the back of an envelope?
3946691 3949107 Here, write it here.
3955775 3960524 This is how you write it.<br />You say... Szczepansky.
3967108 3970899 That man?<br />Bless my soul...
3971025 3972399 I've read his book.
3972525 3976815 So your mother took him in<br />like the good Samaritan.
3976941 3980357 I'll tell you what, youngsters,<br />your mother must be a very good woman.
3981358 3983815 - Yes, she is.<br />- And you're a good man.
3983941 3986232 You flatter me.
3986358 3989107 Now am I to tell you<br />what I think of you?
3989233 3990857 - Oh, please don't.<br />- Why?
3992733 3994565 I don't know why exactly,
3994691 3997190 only if it's something horrid<br />I don't want you to.
3998816 4001399 And if it's something nice<br />I'd rather you didn't.
4001525 4005482 Then all I will say is that I'm very glad<br />you came to me about all this,
4005608 4007190 very glad indeed.
4007316 4010732 And I shouldn't be surprised<br />if I don't find out something very soon.
4010858 4013149 Well now tell me something<br />about yourselves.
4014150 4015190 Tea first.
4033691 4035315 Who on earth?
4037941 4040024 Let's go and see.
4043525 4046024 - Hello.<br />- Hello.
4046150 4048565 Hello.<br />Good news, my dears.
4048691 4051357 I've found your Russian friend's<br />wife and children.
4051483 4053357 - Oh!<br />- And I couldn't resist
4053483 4057232 the temptation of having the pleasure<br />of telling him
4057358 4059732 No, you tell him, my dear.
4061858 4065024 And the other two<br />will show me the way.
4069608 4074565 Mother, Mr. Szczepansky's wife<br />and children have been found.
4083691 4086232 - Goodbye.<br />- Goodbye, sir.
4086358 4088357 Goodbye.
4090566 4093065 - Right away, Mr. Mitchell.<br />- Thank you, Mr. Perks.
4093191 4094524 Goodbye.
4096733 4098274 Excellent.
4103608 4106024 - Bye.<br />- Goodbye.
4124983 4129482 Ah! There, that's a likely<br />little brooch that.
4129608 4133274 I don't know as ever I seen a thing<br />more like a buttercup,
4133400 4135190 without it were a buttercup.
4135316 4137357 Mother gave it to me<br />for my birthday.
4137483 4140607 Oh, is that it?<br />I didn't see it close to.
4140733 4144024 It highly decorative that,<br />thank you.
4144150 4147399 - When's your birthday, Mr. Perks?<br />- My birthday?
4147525 4149815 I gave up keeping my birthday<br />afore you lot were born.
4149941 4152399 But you must have been born<br />sometime, you know.
4152525 4156190 Even if it was 20 years ago<br />or 30 years ago or 60 or 70.
4156316 4159565 Yeah, well it weren't quite<br />so long as that.
4159691 4161565 Oh... oh!
4161691 4164357 If you really want to know,
4164483 4167149 it's my 42 years<br />come the 15th of this month.
4167275 4168440 Why don't you keep it then?
4168566 4170607 I've got other things to keep<br />besides birthdays.
4170733 4173690 Oh what?<br />Not secrets, Mr. Perks.
4173816 4176565 No, the kids and bloomin' missus.
4185358 4188357 I've sold another story, darlings,<br />the one about the King of the Mussels
4188483 4189899 so there'll be buns for tea.
4190025 4192065 You can go and got them<br />the moment they're ready.
4192191 4196649 Would you mind if we didn't them tonight,<br />but on the 15th? That's next Thursday.
4196775 4198732 I don't mind, darling,<br />but why?
4199691 4202065 Well, it's Mr. Perks' birthday,<br />he's 42.
4202191 4205315 He says he doesn't keep his birthday<br />any more, he's got other things to keep.
4205441 4209649 Not rabbits and secrets,<br />but the kids and the bloomin' missus.
4209775 4212774 - His wife and children, Bobbie.<br />- It's the same thing, isn't it?
4212900 4215690 Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ<br />of endearment, isn't it?
4215816 4218274 - Term of endearment, Phyl.<br />- Yes.
4218400 4220524 We thought we'd make<br />a nice birthday for him.
4220650 4222024 He's been very nice to us.
4222150 4224940 And we agreed that next bun day<br />we'd ask if we could.
4225066 4228232 It would be rather nice to write his name<br />on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?
4228358 4232065 - Perks isn't a very pretty name.<br />- Albert's his other name, I asked once.
4232191 4233774 I think Albert's a pretty name.
4237400 4239190 What's the matter with that?
4241358 4243440 What about flowers?
4243566 4246190 He's got lots of flowers of his own,<br />hasn't he?
4246316 4249190 Yes, but it's always nice<br />to be given them.
4249316 4251315 Let's all just sit and think.
4251441 4255940 No one's to speak<br />until they've thought of something.
4262483 4264065 - I've got it.<br />- What?
4264191 4267524 - Perks is so nice to everyone, right?<br />- Right.
4267650 4271232 So there must be lots of people<br />who'd like to help make him a birthday.
4271358 4274065 Mother said<br />we weren't to ask people for things.
4274191 4276399 For ourselves, she meant,<br />not for other people.
4276525 4278274 I think we should ask Mummy first.
4278400 4280940 There's no harm in it,<br />it depends how you do it.
4281066 4284274 I only hope Mr. Perks won't be offended<br />and think it's charity.
4284400 4286232 Poor people can be very proud,<br />you know.
4286358 4289232 It's not because he's poor,<br />it's because we're fond of him.
4289358 4291774 All right, I'll look out some things<br />that Phyllis has outgrown.
4291900 4295399 - Will that do?<br />- I'm sure he'd love that.
4295525 4297607 Come back tomorrow<br />and I'll see what I can do.
4297733 4299607 - Oh, thank you, goodbye.<br />- Goodbye.
4299733 4300899 Thank you, bye bye.
4301025 4303774 I've always liked Mrs. Ransome.
4303900 4307024 - Oh, thank you.<br />- Of course.
4308816 4310732 Thank you very much.<br />Goodbye.
4310858 4312857 Bye!
4317566 4320899 <i>Some people were kind<br />and some were crusty</i>
4321025 4322940 <i>and some would give<br />some would not.</i>
4323066 4325899 It's Mr. Perks' birthday on Thursday,<br />would you like to give him a present?
4326025 4330732 - No, I would not. I hate the man.<br />- Thank you!
4330858 4332357 That was pretty rude.
4332983 4337232 <i>It's rather difficult work<br />asking for things, even for other people.</i>
4337358 4339440 <i>as you've no doubt found<br />if you've ever tried it.</i>
4339566 4342732 Tobacco pipe,<br />half a pound of tea.
4342858 4347232 - Woollen scarf from the Drapers.<br />- A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest.
4347358 4350565 There it is, you can have it<br />and good riddance to it.
4350691 4352857 - Oh!<br />- Thank you.
4355983 4358399 - Bye.<br />- Goodbye.
4364108 4366649 Thank you, Mr. James,<br />he'll love that.
4366775 4368857 Goodbye.
4386316 4388482 Hello?
4388608 4391399 Hello, is anyone at home?
4391525 4394065 Me Mam's upstairs,<br />a-changing herself.
4394191 4395982 Mam, visitors!
4396108 4399399 Thank you Patrick,<br />just coming.
4401358 4403607 I'm a bit late changing, Miss,
4403733 4406232 owing to me having had<br />an extra clean up today
4406358 4409065 along with Perks happening to say<br />it's his birthday.
4409191 4411815 I don't know what put such an idea<br />into his head.
4411941 4414232 We keeps the children's birthdays,<br />of course,
4414358 4417815 but him and me... Well, we've no time<br />for suchlike as a general rule.
4417941 4421065 We know it was his birthday<br />and we've brought him some presents.
4421191 4424149 Oh, bring them in my dears.
4433483 4436649 Oh, don't, please don't,<br />Mrs. Perks.
4436775 4437940 Whatever is the matter?
4438066 4440440 Do you mean to say<br />you don't like the things we brought?
4440566 4441690 Don't you like them?
4441816 4445399 Oh, there, there, don't mind me,<br />I'm all right.
4445525 4450065 Like them? Why it's a birthday<br />such as Perks never had,
4450191 4451940 not even when he were a boy.
4452066 4453649 Good, I'm glad you're pleased.
4453775 4455732 Could we wait and see<br />if Mr. Perks is pleased too?
4455858 4457774 I won't say another word.
4457900 4460482 Could we have a plate for the buns,<br />Mrs. Perks?
4460608 4462190 Oh, of course.
4462316 4464399 Fit for a prince, I'd say.
4464525 4468940 I never thought there'd be more for him,<br />except the ounce of his backie.
4469066 4473232 # I'm feeling right today
4473358 4475815 # Been a lovely day... #
4480400 4483024 Bless us, he's early.
4483150 4485274 Let's hide in there<br />and you tell him about it
4485400 4487649 but give him the tobacco first<br />as you got it for him.
4487775 4490524 When you've told him,<br />we'll shout "Many Happy Returns".
4493816 4494899 Oh!
4495025 4496774 - How do.<br />- How do.
4498525 4500399 Hello, old woman.
4504691 4508274 - Well here's a pretty set out.<br />- It's your birthday tea, Bert.
4510483 4514815 And here's an ounce<br />of your extra particular.
4514941 4518732 Yes, she's a good old girl.
4518858 4521690 Eh, what's that pram doing here?<br />Hey, you're not...?
4524900 4528274 Well, what's all these bundles?<br />Eh?
4528400 4531149 And what's all this sweet stuff and...?
4532566 4535857 What's this squirrel<br />doing on the table, eh?
4536983 4540899 Oh, lor!<br />Whatever should we do?
4541733 4544274 I've forgotten to put the labels<br />on any of the things.
4544400 4546732 He won't know what's from whom.
4546858 4548232 He'll think it's all from us
4548358 4551607 and that we're trying to be grand and<br />charitable or something horrid like that.
4551733 4552815 Ssh, be quiet!
4552941 4555274 I don't care. I won't stand it.<br />I tell you straight.
4555400 4558190 But, it's them children<br />you make such a fuss about,
4558316 4559899 the children from the Three Chimneys.
4560025 4563649 I don't care,<br />not if it was angels from heaven.
4563775 4565940 We got on all right all these years<br />and no favours asked.
4566066 4568690 I'm not having these charity<br />goings-on at my time of life.
4568816 4570357 And don't you think it, Nell.
4570483 4573232 Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue,<br />for goodness sake.
4573358 4576690 All three of’em is in the other room<br />a-listening to every word you speaks.
4576816 4578815 I'll give them something to listen to.
4578941 4581232 I've spoke my mind to these afore<br />and I'll do it again. Come out.
4581358 4583274 Come on out!<br />Out here, come on.
4583400 4585065 No, not you lot, you stop in...
4585191 4587815 Sophie, look put some pants<br />on Benjamin, we've got company.
4592108 4594607 Right, you can tell me<br />what you mean by it.
4594733 4598190 Have I ever complained of being short<br />as you starts this charity with me?
4598316 4600815 We thought you'd be so pleased,<br />Mr. Perks.
4600941 4603649 I'll never try and be kind to anyone else<br />as long as I live.
4603775 4606607 - No, I won't. Not never!<br />- We didn't mean any harm.
4606733 4608524 It isn't what you means<br />so much as what you does.
4608650 4611690 We thought you'd love it.<br />We always have things on our birthdays.
4611816 4613399 Oh ay, from your own relations,<br />that's different.
4613525 4614940 No, not just our relations.
4615066 4616649 They're from all sorts of people<br />in the village.
4616775 4619149 - And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.<br />- We did.
4629733 4634065 So you've been telling the neighbours<br />that we can't make both ends meet.
4635233 4638065 Now you've disgraced us as deep<br />as you can in the neighbourhood,
4638191 4641107 you can take that pack of tricks<br />back where it came from.
4641233 4643940 I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.
4644066 4647065 I don't doubt that you meant it kind
4647191 4651274 but I'd rather not be acquainted with you<br />any longer, if it's all the same to you.
4654775 4657357 Look here.<br />We'll go if you like
4657483 4660274 and you needn't be friends with us<br />any more, but...
4660400 4663357 We'll always be friends with you,<br />even though you're nasty to us.
4663483 4667774 But before we go, let us show you<br />these labels to put on the things.
4667900 4669399 I don't want to see no labels
4669525 4671899 except proper luggage labels<br />in me own walk of life.
4672025 4675649 - Please let Bobbie show you the labels.<br />- All right, go on.
4675775 4678732 We wrote down everything<br />everybody said
4678858 4681440 when they gave us the things<br />with the people's names on.
4681566 4684690 Because Mother said<br />that we ought to be careful because...
4684816 4686607 Well I wrote down what she said<br />and you'll see.
4686733 4687815 That's from Mother.
4687941 4691399 She thought Mrs. Perks might like<br />some of Phyllis' things.
4692525 4695607 "I can't do much..."
4699983 4704899 Well that's all right.<br />I mean, your ma's a born lady.
4705025 4707065 We'll keep the little frocks<br />and what-not, Nell.
4707191 4708315 Yes, Albert.
4708441 4712232 Then there's the perambulator<br />and the gooseberries and sweets.
4712358 4713774 They're from Mrs. Ransome.
4713900 4718149 I can't send the pram back, Bert,<br />and I won't so don't ask me.
4718275 4720149 I'm not asking anything.
4720275 4723065 Then there's the shovel.<br />Mr. James made that for you himself
4723191 4725149 and he says...
4725275 4727107 Oh, where is it?<br />Oh, yes, here.
4727233 4730190 - No er, you can read it.<br />- He says,
4730316 4734899 "You tell Mr. Perks it is a pleasure<br />to make a little trifle for a man
4735025 4737232 "as is so much respected."
4737358 4739482 He's a good chap, that.
4740525 4742482 He's a very good chap, that.
4743358 4745065 He's not bad at all, that chap.
4745191 4747399 And everybody who gave anything<br />said they liked you
4747525 4749565 and thought it was<br />a very good idea of ours.
4749691 4755482 And nobody said anything about charity<br />or anything horrid like that.
4755608 4758940 We thought that you'd love to know<br />how fond everybody is of you.
4760608 4763815 And I've never so unhappy<br />in all my born days.
4763941 4765482 Goodbye.<br />Come on.
4767525 4768565 Stop!
4772316 4776607 I take back every word I've said<br />contrary to what you'd wish.
4776733 4778440 - Nell?<br />- Yes, Albert.
4778566 4780065 Put the kettle on.
4780191 4782857 We'll take away the things<br />if you're unhappy with them.
4782983 4784190 I'm not unhappy about’em.
4785566 4787815 I don't know<br />if I was ever better pleased.
4787941 4791482 ...Not so much with the presents<br />though frankly they're an A. 1 collection
4791608 4793607 but the kind respect<br />of our neighbours.
4793733 4797190 - That's worth having, eh Nell?<br />- I think it's all worth having...
4797316 4800649 And you've made a most ridiculous fuss<br />about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.
4800775 4802232 No, I haven't.
4802358 4804732 If a man didn't respect himself,<br />no one wouldn't do it for him.
4804858 4807607 But everyone respects you.<br />They all said so.
4807733 4810315 We knew you'd like it<br />once you understood.
4812733 4816899 Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?
4817025 4819232 May the garland of friendship<br />be ever green.
4819358 4822232 May our garland of friendship<br />be ever green, Mr. Perks.
4822358 4824565 Hear, hear!
4824691 4826732 Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it?
4826858 4830399 Let's have a look at them buns<br />you brought in. Where are they?
4830525 4832940 Who wrote that?<br />It's Albert.
4833066 4834732 Holy Mary, Mother of God
4834858 4839065 pray for us sinners now<br />and at the hour of our death. Amen.
4853316 4857482 Now go to sleep all of you<br />and not another word.
4863400 4866399 - Good night.<br />- Good night, Mum.
4866525 4869857 Yeah they're jolly good<br />little kids, those Waterburys.
4869983 4872440 Oh, they're all right,<br />bless their hearts.
4872566 4875732 It's you that's the aggravatingest old thing<br />that ever was.
4875858 4878190 - I was ashamed of you, I tell you.<br />- You needn't be.
4878316 4881565 I climbed down handsome<br />as soon as I understood it weren't charity.
4881691 4884440 Charity's one thing I never could abide,<br />and won't neither.
4884566 4887524 - Go to sleep, Albert.<br />- Yes, dear.
4888358 4890940 I tell you this though,
4891066 4893399 it isn't what you does<br />so much as what you means,
4893525 4895482 that's what I say.
4895608 4898565 - Now if it had been charity...<br />- Oh, drat charity, Bert.
4898691 4902732 Nobody won't offer you charity<br />however much you was to want it.
4902858 4906065 That were just friendliness,<br />that were.
4906191 4910065 I reckon it's what people call<br />loving kindness.
4910191 4913274 - Now go to sleep, Bert.<br />- Yes dear, good night.
4913400 4916732 Good night, Bert.<br />Happy Birthday.
4929525 4931107 Nell?
4933066 4936357 Oh, all right, Bert,<br />as it's your birthday.
4968691 4970815 Hello, my dears.
4970941 4972982 Hard at it, are yer?
4973108 4975565 Yeah. Well, er... Yeah.
4975691 4977815 One good turn deserves another,<br />that's what I always say.
4977941 4979315 Hello, Mr. Perks,<br />how do mean?
4979441 4983649 Well I found these magazines, you see,<br />in the waiting room.
4983775 4985565 I was cleaning up.
4985691 4989315 They were in a cupboard and well<br />they're only collecting dust and...
4989441 4991982 Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.
4992108 4993149 - Hello.<br />- Hello.
4993275 4995690 I thought perhaps<br />you might like them.
4995816 4999357 There's a lot of pictures in’em.<br />and that,
4999483 5001565 and you can colour’em up<br />with chalks and that.
5001691 5002857 Anyway I don't want’em.
5002983 5004774 - You're a dear.<br />- Yes, you are.
5006150 5009565 - Hear, hear!<br />- Well, that's all right then.
5009691 5012065 I must be getting along.<br />I've got lots to do.
5012191 5013982 Perks must be about it.
5014108 5016940 Thank you.<br />That was very kind of him.
5018441 5020315 We'd better go inside,<br />it's going to rain.
5051358 5052357 Daddy...
5089316 5092399 - Where's Bobbie?<br />- I thought I heard her upstairs.
5092525 5096565 She knows it's tea time.<br />I wonder if she's all right.
5099400 5117607 Bobbie?
5120858 5122482 What is it darling?
5124608 5125690 Oh, Mummy!
5140691 5142315 You don't believe Daddy did it?
5142441 5145065 - No.<br />- Because it's not true.
5145191 5148607 They have shut him in prison,<br />but he's done nothing wrong.
5148733 5151940 He's good and honourable<br />and he belongs to us.
5153066 5156732 Will it make you very unhappy<br />if you tell me all about it?
5156858 5158357 I want to understand.
5164483 5168149 Do you remember the day<br />those two men took Daddy away?
5169150 5170190 Yes, I do.
5170316 5174732 Well they arrested him, charging him<br />with selling State secrets
5174858 5177982 with being, in fact,<br />a spy and a traitor.
5180025 5182982 How could anyone believe that?
5183108 5185399 How could anyone do such a thing?
5185525 5187357 Someone did.
5188483 5192065 Why didn't you tell someone,<br />a lawyer?
5193066 5197565 There wasn't anyone who could<br />hurt Daddy on purpose, was there?
5197691 5201774 I don't know.<br />It's all so complicated.
5202733 5206815 There was a man in the office<br />who was very envious of your father.
5206941 5209774 Daddy always said<br />he didn't quite trust him.
5210525 5212565 Why didn't you explain<br />all that to someone?
5212691 5215065 No one would listen.
5215191 5218190 Do you suppose<br />I haven't tried everything?
5218316 5222232 No, my darling,<br />what we have to do, you and I,
5222358 5225774 and Daddy, is to be brave.
5275941 5277274 Where have you been?
5278358 5279940 Where have I been?
5280066 5282149 Down to the station.<br />Don't ask why, it's a secret.
5282275 5283440 Oh, please yourself.
5283566 5286649 - There's a paper chase tomorrow.<br />- Oh, whoopee!
5286775 5288232 - Who?<br />- The grammar school boys.
5288358 5289315 Oh zippee!
5289441 5291565 Perks says we can see them<br />going along by the line.
5291691 5293107 Oh really?
5294525 5296357 What's a paper chase?
5314150 5315732 Let me pass please
5320775 5323815 Hey! That's against by-laws.
5323941 5327232 - I ought to report him.<br />- They're only having fun.
5327358 5331399 Passengers is forbidden to cross the line<br />on any pretence.
5331525 5334982 He ain't no passenger.<br />He's out of sight now, anyway.
5335108 5339774 What the eye don't see the heart need<br />take no notice of, that what I always say.
5340941 5342982 Come on then.
5343816 5346399 He's gone in the tunnel.
5346525 5348482 Oh, it is dark in here.
5356566 5358690 They don't know<br />what they're in for.
5358816 5360565 It isn't easy running in the dark.
5360691 5363690 They'll take a long time<br />going through, won't they?
5363816 5365607 Aye, they will that.
5374400 5376857 - They went that way.<br />- Oh thanks!
5378275 5381149 I know! Let's cut across to the top<br />and see them come out the other end.
5381275 5383440 - We'll be there before they are.<br />- Good idea.
5383566 5385107 Yes, good idea!
5424858 5429315 - This way!<br />- No, this way. Come on, quick.
5438566 5439982 There, that's all.
5440108 5441565 What should we do now?
5441691 5443857 Not yet,<br />there's one in a red jersey.
5443983 5445690 He hasn't come out yet.
5446775 5448815 Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth
5448941 5451774 and perhaps we can see him<br />from the inside.
5464191 5465899 It's dark in there.
5466025 5468565 - Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you.<br />- I don't like it.
5469983 5472899 Still no sign of him. I reckon<br />he must have had an accident.
5473025 5475815 Let's go and rescue him.<br />Come on.
5475941 5477899 Come on, Phyl.<br />Keep close behind me.
5478025 5480149 If a train comes along<br />get flat against the tunnel wall
5480275 5482024 and hold your skirts against you.
5482150 5483524 I still don't like it.
5494191 5497815 - I want to go back.<br />- Ssh, don't be silly. What is that?
5497941 5499399 It's another earthquake!
5516108 5519065 - It's a train.<br />- Oh, let me go back!
5519191 5521440 Don't be a coward, it's quite safe.<br />Stand back.
5521566 5523482 Come in, come on.
5546650 5548982 It is a dragon.<br />I always thought it was.
5562775 5563982 Come on.
5564108 5566815 Supposing that boy<br />was caught underneath the train...
5566941 5569232 - Oh!<br />- We've got to go and see.
5569358 5571899 Can't we go and get someone<br />from the station?
5572025 5574274 - Phyl, you wait here.<br />- No.
5574400 5579399 Hello?
5581358 5583857 Hey you two, come quickly!
5585400 5589149 Oh, is that blood?<br />Is that red blood?
5589275 5592399 - Is he all killed?<br />- Phyllis, please.
5592525 5595357 Hurry up you two, get help.
5609233 5613274 "It was on a hot summer's afternoon..."
5613400 5618940 Oh, do come down, we've found a hound<br />in a red jersey and he's broken his leg.
5619066 5621232 They're bringing him here,<br />I've sent for Doctor Forrest.
5621358 5624149 But you should send for a vet,<br />I can't have a lame dog here.
5624275 5626357 Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy.
5626483 5628565 Well then he ought to be taken<br />to his mother.
5628691 5631940 His mother's dead,<br />his father's in Northumberland.
5632066 5634024 Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him,<br />won't you?
5634150 5636565 I told him I was sure you'd want us<br />to have him here.
5636691 5640024 - You always want to help everybody.<br />- Come along.
5650358 5652232 I'm glad you brought him here.
5652358 5656024 - Let's get him to bed.<br />- It will hurt a bit, won't it?
5656150 5661649 I hope you don't think I'm a coward if<br />I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.
5661775 5663524 I don't want to cause you<br />any more trouble.
5663650 5668065 Don't you worry, you're the one<br />who's got the trouble.
5668191 5670982 We'd love to have you here,<br />wouldn't we, Bobbie?
5671108 5672607 Yes.
5676025 5678857 That will be Doctor Forrest.<br />I'll go.
5689191 5692857 - That's not the doctor.<br />- I know.
5692983 5695274 I know that voice though,<br />at least I think I do.
5695400 5699815 I thought I recognised it too.<br />It's not the doctor, that's for sure.
5703108 5706940 Could it be that Doctor Forrest<br />has been attacked by highwaymen
5707066 5709690 and left for dead and this is the man<br />they've telegraphed
5709816 5712482 - to take his place?<br />- Perhaps he's gone mad.
5712608 5715357 Perhaps he's caught something awful<br />from one of his patients
5715483 5716982 and that man's come to tell her.
5717108 5719232 Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man<br />up into Jim's bedroom.
5719358 5720940 Why should she?
5721066 5724065 Listen.<br />The door's opening.
5734691 5736440 Now they'll come down.
5736566 5738607 It's rude to listen like this.
5738733 5742732 It's not listening, nobody in their senses<br />would talk secrets on the stairs.
5742858 5744649 Bobbie?
5744775 5747565 A relative of Jim's has come,<br />he wants to see you.
5747691 5748649 Wash your hands and faces.
5748775 5750690 We'll be in the dining room<br />when you're ready.
5750816 5751857 Yes, Mama.
5754191 5757565 There now!<br />Fancy not thinking of that, hm?
5757691 5761065 - Any hot water, Mrs. Viney?<br />- Righto love.
5767191 5769732 You all right?<br />There we are, that's it.
5773066 5774815 Well I never did!
5774941 5777524 This, my dears,<br />is Jim's grandfather.
5777650 5781024 Our own old gentleman!<br />I'm so awfully glad it's you.
5781150 5784065 When I just think of all<br />the old gentlemen there are in the world
5784191 5785982 it could have been anyone.
5786108 5788065 You're not going to take<br />Jim away though, are you?
5788191 5789357 Not at present.
5789483 5792649 Your mother has most kindly consented<br />to let him stay here.
5792775 5797274 I thought of sending a nurse but your<br />mother said she'd nurse him herself.
5797400 5800607 But we won't have anything to eat<br />if Mother doesn't write.
5800733 5802732 That's all right, Peter.
5802858 5804607 I see you trust your children.
5804733 5807815 - Of course.<br />- Then I may tell them our arrangement.
5807941 5809565 Sit down, my dears.
5812025 5816440 Your Mother, my dears, has consented<br />to give up her writing for a while
5816566 5818774 and to become<br />a matron of my hospital.
5818900 5821565 Does that mean we'll have to leave<br />Three Chimneys and the railways?
5821691 5824190 No, no, my darling. No.
5824316 5827024 The hospital is here.
5827150 5831940 The Three Chimneys Hospital<br />and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.
5832066 5835565 - Will Mother go on writing again?<br />- We shall see...
5835691 5837815 Perhaps something nice will happen<br />and she won't have to.
5837941 5839940 - But I like my writing.<br />- I know.
5840066 5844065 Don't be afraid I'm going to try<br />and interfere but one never know.
5844191 5847357 Very beautiful and wonderful things<br />do happen, don't they?
5847483 5851940 And we live most of our lives<br />in the hope of them.
5859566 5863024 I got your letter my dear,<br />but it wasn't needed.
5863150 5867732 When I read about your father's case<br />in the papers at the time I had my doubts.
5867858 5871815 And ever since I've known who you were,<br />I've been trying to find out things
5871941 5874190 and I have hopes.
5874316 5877607 - Oh...<br />- Yes, I may say, great hopes.
5877733 5880607 But keep your secret<br />for a little while longer.
5880733 5883940 Wouldn't do to upset your mother<br />with a false hope, would it?
5884066 5887232 But it isn't false.<br />I know you can do it.
5887358 5890149 I knew you could when I wrote.<br />It isn't false hope, is it?
5890275 5891940 No, my dear.
5892066 5895690 You don't believe Daddy did it?<br />Oh, say you don't believe he did.
5895816 5899524 My dear, I'm perfectly certain<br />he didn't.
5915525 5918024 <i>Life at Three Chimneys<br />was never quite the same again</i>
5918150 5919732 <i>after the old gentleman<br />came to see us.</i>
5922025 5923774 Oh, please Phyllis.
5923900 5926482 <i>The house became a hospital.</i>
5928525 5930774 I give you three guesses<br />who that is.
5933941 5937274 Is everything all right?<br />Good luck. I'll curtain up.
5939150 5940190 Have you...
5940316 5944399 Have you noticed<br />the ship is sinking?
5944525 5947940 Yes I know,<br />but don't blame me.
5949691 5953274 Oh, no!<br />Oh, no they'll all get so wet.
5954358 5956982 You'll need some light<br />on the subject.
5958733 5962482 As your solicitor<br />I must advise you.
5964025 5966232 Don't worry.
5966358 5969482 Don't worry,<br />I've managed to get most of the survivors.
5969608 5971190 Right, curtain down.
5971316 5974524 Thank you, good evening.
5981983 5984065 I hope you enjoyed it.
5994358 5997024 Children, will you please be quiet.
5997150 5998732 Oh, the blood!
6000733 6002899 - Oh, is it over?<br />- Oh, thank goodness.
6003025 6005357 - Oh, you are a good doctor.<br />- Can I have that please?
6005483 6006982 There we are. How's that?
6007775 6009399 - Cheerio.<br />- Bye.
6009525 6012857 <i>Jim's leg got better<br />and he went home.</i>
6012983 6015607 - Right away, Mr. Mitchell.<br />- Thank you, Mr. Perks.
6021816 6023899 - Goodbye.<br />- Goodbye.
6024025 6028274 - Goodbye.<br />- Bye, I'll write.
6030358 6035065 - Lor lummy, Pete!<br />- They'll have to marry now!
6035191 6036190 Lummy.
6040441 6043565 <i>We seemed to be hardly<br />Railway Children at all in those days</i>
6043691 6048690 <i>and as the days went on each of us<br />had an uneasy feeling about this</i>
6048816 6050899 <i>which Phyllis expressed one day.</i>
6051025 6055024 I wonder if the railway misses us.<br />We never go and see it now.
6055150 6056399 It seems ungrateful.
6056525 6059649 We loved it so when we hadn't<br />anyone to play with.
6059775 6062690 The thing I don't like is our having<br />stopped waving to the 9:15
6062816 6064857 and sending our love to Father by it.
6064983 6067357 Let's begin again tomorrow.
6081358 6083399 Hurry up, Fatty,<br />for goodness sake.
6083525 6085857 I can't, my bootlace is undone.
6085983 6089399 When you marry your laces<br />will come undone going up the aisle
6089525 6092649 and the man that you marry<br />will tumble over and smash his nose in.
6092775 6097482 I'd rather marry a man with<br />a smashed in nose than not marry at all.
6104066 6107524 - Take our love to Father!<br />- Take our love to Father!
6145525 6147149 Most extraordinary!
6147275 6151190 - Most extraordinary.<br />- Extraordinary indeed.
6152650 6156940 Now, Bobbie,<br />I wonder whether you could...
6158816 6160982 Don't you feel well?
6161108 6165232 I don't know.<br />I don't know how I feel...
6165358 6167190 Will you let me off lessons today?
6167316 6171440 I feel as if I want to be<br />quite alone, by myself.
6171566 6173690 Of course I'll let you off.
6180400 6184024 What is it?<br />You don't feel ill, do you?
6184150 6187190 No, not ill.
6187316 6191065 I've just got to be alone,<br />do you know?
6191191 6195815 Mm, sometimes Roberta,<br />you're so like me.
6202191 6204315 I'll be more alive in the garden.
6216400 6218899 - Morning, Miss, I'm sure.<br />- Good luck, Miss Roberta.
6219025 6220565 Thank you.
6222525 6225815 Hello. Look, if this is the train,<br />it'll be smart work.
6225941 6230440 Bless you. I seen it in the paper. I was<br />never so pleased in all my born days.
6230566 6233315 One I most have and no offence I know<br />on a day like this.
6234191 6237024 And one for luck.<br />You ain't offended, are you?
6237150 6240399 I haven't taken too great a liberty, have I,<br />on a day like this, you know.
6240525 6243399 - No, Mr. Perks, of course it's not a liberty.<br />- No.
6243525 6247190 Dear Mr. Perks, we love you quite as much<br />as if you were an uncle of our own
6247316 6248649 but on a day like what?
6248775 6252149 Well like this’ere. I told you,<br />I seen it in the papers, didn't I?
6252275 6254024 Saw what in the papers?
6254150 6264274 Oakworth!
6265775 6268607 Oakworth Station.
6268733 6271565 Oakworth. There we are.<br />Thank you, Madam.
6271691 6274274 Yes, thank you.<br />Quick as you can, please.
6275691 6278732 Oakworth Station.
6282150 6285524 - Right away, Mr. Cryer.<br />- Thank you, Mr. Perks.
6322525 6325482 Daddy, my Daddy!
6423525 6427565 <i>I think just now<br />we're not wanted there.</i>
6427691 6430982 <i>Not for a few minutes anyway.</i>
6431108 6435982 <i>I think it would best for us<br />to go quickly and quietly.</i>
6436108 6442565 <i>We'll go to the end of the field<br />among the thin gold spikes of grass.</i>
6442691 6447690 <i>We may just take one last look<br />over our shoulders, at the house</i>
6447816 6451190 <i>where neither we nor anyone else<br />is wanted now.</i>
6526525 6530024 - Bye.<br />- Bye, bye.
6530150 6532190 Hope you loved it.
6544525 6546274 Goodbye.
