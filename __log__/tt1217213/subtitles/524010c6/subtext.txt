50317 55122 If you had wings to lift you<br />and the Second Star your guide,
56056 60928 you'd find a place where<br />all the seasons flourish side by side.
61795 65532 Yet past the Summer Meadow<br />and beyond the Autumn Wood,
66533 71471 lies an icy land of secrets,<br />a world misunderstood.
73440 77911 But if your mind is open<br />and your heart just has to know,
78645 83517 your wings can take you farther<br />than you ever thought you'd go.
92125 94728 We'll be there<br />at the first breath of spring
94795 98832 When the birds start to sing<br />and the grass starts growing
98899 101535 We'll be there<br />in the still summer heat
101602 105172 With the meadow's gleaming gold
106006 108542 We'll be there<br />on the crisp autumn days
108609 112746 With the leaves all ablaze<br />in the cool breeze blowing
112813 115549 We'll be there for it all every year
115616 119319 As we've been since days of old
120387 125859 For what if the world is wider<br />than we ever knew?
127261 133166 And through all the seasons<br />didn't we dream of something more?
134301 137971 What if we brave the great unknown?
138038 141441 What if we're not so all alone?
141508 147581 What if it's you I'm searching for?
150150 151518 Look sharp, everyone!
151585 153554 The snowy owls will soon be arriving
153620 156790 to take the snowflake baskets<br />to the Winter Woods.
157424 160527 Lucinda, stop noodling<br />and start tinkering.
165999 167034 Is that the last load?
168001 169369 Thanks, Cheese.
170637 173006 Basket weaving<br />is my favorite thing, Bobble.
173073 174942 Really? I'm partial to macramÃ©.
175008 176777 Morning, Clank. Morning, Bobble.
176844 177878 Morning!
178445 180480 That should be enough<br />to finish the snowflake baskets.
180547 181882 Aye, that will do her.
181949 182950 Thanks!
183784 185018 Clanky.
185085 186320 Sorry.
186386 188188 I can't believe we make the baskets,
188255 190691 but don't get to take them<br />to the Winter Fairies.
190757 193527 I mean, wouldn't you want to<br />go into the Winter Woods?
195629 197931 We wouldn't last a day in that cold.
197998 200767 Besides, I'm afraid of glaciers.
201001 202002 Glaciers?
202069 204438 They're known for their stealth.
205038 206473 He's never actually seen one.
206540 207975 You never do!
210077 211411 The snowy owls!
213347 215082 Places, everyone!
215148 216984 Clank, Bobble, get that basket up.
217050 218785 Right! Got it, Fairy Mary!
218852 219987 Start the pulley!
246280 248048 Newcomer.
262863 263864 Wow.
263931 265933 The final shipment order.
266867 270804 Goodness! They need 20 more baskets<br />for tomorrow's pickup.
287054 289223 There's a whole other world over there.
289289 293560 Well done, everyone!<br />The first shipment is headed for Winter.
293627 295896 But there's much more to do<br />for tomorrow's pickup,
295963 298799 so this is no time to rest on your laurels.
298866 301935 Lucinda, get off your laurel<br />and get to work.
306139 307674 Look out!
310911 312045 Runaway bunny!
316750 317851 No!
319319 321188 -Got you!<br />-Thanks, Tink.
321255 322689 No problem, Fawn.
322756 326260 Come on, little guy.<br />It's still a long way to the Winter Woods.
326326 328462 You're taking the animals today?
328529 329596 Trying to.
329663 331565 It's time for them to cross the border,
331632 333867 but this little guy is a handful.
333934 336470 Hey, how about if I help?
338639 340440 Slow down! Slow down!
341208 343210 -Need some help?<br />-Nope. Doing fine.
343277 345012 That lost thing really is handy.
345078 346079 Yeah.
346146 348348 Heel, Hoppy, heel! Slow down!
356924 358358 Wow.
360160 362162 Don't be scared, little fellow.
362229 364464 We'll let the weasels go first.
365265 368969 Come on. Come on. Come on!
370070 373106 So, how far do we take the animals in?
373640 375742 Tink, we don't cross the border.
375809 377277 We just help the animals cross.
377344 381415 But I thought Animal Fairies<br />got to cross with the animals.
381481 383417 Tink, it's freezing over there.
383483 386386 Besides, no Warm Fairies<br />are allowed in the Winter Woods.
386453 388922 Just like Winter Fairies<br />aren't allowed over here.
390290 391892 Who made up that rule?
391959 394795 I think it was the Lord of Winter.
394862 396063 Winter has a lord?
396129 398065 All right, guys. You ready?
407474 410043 -Wow.<br />-Pretty great, huh?
412546 413881 It's incredible.
413947 416617 They get their winter coats<br />to protect them from the cold.
417584 420654 Your turn. Go on.
427895 430230 Go on, now. Follow your brothers.
449383 450517 Bye-bye!
450584 452419 All right, big guy.
452819 454221 Oh, no.
455923 458692 No hibernating yet.<br />You do that in Winter!
459459 461728 Come on. Come on!
462829 465299 Wake up. Wake up.
467134 468368 Come on.
468435 470237 Wake up.
470637 472139 Rise and shine.
520187 522054 Tink!
522589 524224 Tink!
524291 525692 -Tinker Bell!<br />-What?
531298 534635 Tink! I told you,<br />we're not allowed to cross.
536837 537838 Your wings.
537905 539239 I know!
539306 540807 They were sparkling.
540874 542409 They're freezing!
542476 544244 We'd better get you<br />to a Healing Talent Fairy.
544311 545512 -But...<br />-Come on.
551585 552853 May I help you?
552920 554087 How much longer?
554154 557891 I told you,<br />a rainbow collision is not an emergency.
558692 560327 But the purple's starting to itch.
560394 561795 Take a seat.
568202 569570 Snapdragon, right?
570504 572439 Not an emergency. Plant it over there.
572506 573507 Thank you.
573574 575876 Hurry, girls. What if we're too late?
577144 579446 -Sorry. Do you know...<br />-Window.
587054 588188 Patient's name?
588255 589623 Tinker Bell.
589690 592092 Yes. The border crosser. She's...
592159 593627 Frozen solid?
594194 595896 -Room two.<br />-Oh, my.
595963 597197 Thank you.
597564 598999 -This way!<br />-Come on, girls. Hurry.
599066 600534 She's right over here. Room two.
600601 601935 -There she is.<br />-Tink!
602903 604338 We got here as quick as we could.
604404 606006 We did have to stop at reception.
606073 607207 Did you really cross?
609076 610177 Well, did you?
619086 622122 Okay. You're all warmed up.<br />Let's test your wings.
622189 623323 Sure.
623390 624391 Open.
625092 626326 Close.
626393 628462 And try a little flap.
629162 630497 A flutter.
630831 632833 Can you give me a flitter?
633166 637671 Okay. Well, I don't see anything<br />unusual. Your wings appear to be fine.
639039 642409 But what about the sparkling?
642476 644444 It must have been the light<br />reflecting off the snow.
644511 645512 -But...<br />-You should have never
645579 646580 crossed the border.
646647 649283 Winter is too cold<br />for our Warm Fairy wings.
649349 652352 Now, to be safe,<br />I want you to take two sunflower seeds
652419 654955 and come back if there is any problem.
655722 657491 Thank you.
657791 659359 We were worried, Tink.
659426 661728 You are so lucky<br />nothing happened to your wings.
661795 663197 Can you imagine?
663263 666200 But something did happen.<br />They sparkled!
666266 669469 But you heard her. It was just the light<br />reflecting off the snow.
669536 672840 No, it wasn't. They actually lit up.
673640 676443 It was brighter than a thousand fireflies.
677010 679146 You saw it. Didn't you, Fawn?
679479 680480 No.
682349 683884 You don't believe me?
684051 685452 Who...
685519 687020 No?
687588 691291 Look, you guys, it happened.<br />It felt like...
691458 693293 -Like...<br />-Like what?
694394 698332 Like the Winter Woods was calling me.
699066 700400 You know?
702769 706440 Not really. Get the doctor.
707674 711545 Animal Fairy Books,<br />101 Uses for Pixie Dust,
711612 713247 Beauty and the Bees...
713480 715382 There's got to be a wing book<br />here somewhere.
715849 718852 Rules for Rainbow Riding.  No, not that.
720487 723156 Hey. Someone's been eating the books!
724591 725926 Bookworms.
727494 728629 What's this?
730197 731331 Light reading.
731932 734268 Dustology, windology...
735536 737871 Wingology. That's got to have it.
747581 748682 Got you!
750684 751852 Sorry.
754788 756290 Okay, let's see.
756456 758458 Wing care. Wing washing. Wing tips.
758625 760861 "Don't get them wet."<br />Everybody knows that.
761028 764531 Sizes, shapes, flapping, fluttering.
764598 766867 Sparkling! I knew it!
770337 772339 Sorry. Found it!
775175 776176 Oh, no.
778111 779580 Thanks a lot.
784017 785085 Okay.
785152 789756 "Sparkling wings.<br />When a most incredible...
789823 792226 "...that the sparkle... There were two."
793293 795863 "That the sparkle... There were two."
795929 800334 Two wings? Two feet? Two what?
804738 806807 -Yes?<br />-Hey.
806874 809977 Do you know anything<br />about sparkling wings?
810544 813080 No. The bookworm ate that page.
813146 814748 Yeah, I know.
814815 816750 But the Keeper does.
816817 818852 The Keeper? Who's the Keeper?
819786 821655 He writes the books.
821722 824458 He is the keeper of all fairy knowledge.
824525 827661 That's perfect. Is he here?<br />I have to talk to him.
827728 832633 I would give anything to talk to him.<br />But you can't.
833400 834401 Why not?
834468 835802 Because he's a Winter Fairy.
835869 839973 In order to talk to him, you would have<br />to go to the Winter Woods.
840040 843343 And that's impossible.<br />Your wings will freeze and...
844645 846013 Chapter 16.
848715 850417 The Winter Woods.
897264 898599 Can't fly.
898966 903937 Hurry, now, hurry! Let's finish up.<br />Stand by with the pulley.
904004 909309 All right! It's this season's final pickup,<br />so let's make it our best.
909510 914281 Lucinda, let's leave the loafing<br />for the Baking Fairies.
914948 916750 -Okay, Clanky.<br />-Right!
917918 920387 Snowflake release system working!
921021 923957 Maybe you should<br />be the test snowflake for a while.
924024 925292 Tink?
925592 927261 We already checked that basket.
927828 929363 Right.
933734 935569 Why are you dressed all cozy?
936436 938038 I'm going to the Winter Woods.
938906 940140 The Winter Woods?
941575 942843 The Winter Woods?
942910 944011 Places, everyone!
944077 945445 The snowy owls. They're here!
945512 947881 Start the pulley!
947948 949049 Bye!
949149 950150 But, Miss...
951718 953387 Tink! Wait!
953887 956490 You can't cross the border, Miss Bell.<br />Your wings!
956557 958425 Don't worry. They're in my coat.
958492 960327 Does this have to do with the...
961929 963730 -The sparkling?<br />-Yes.
963797 965999 There's somebody in Winter<br />who can tell me what it means.
966066 969203 Clank! Bobble!<br />Is something wrong with that basket?
969269 970537 What?
973907 975108 Tink?
975175 976910 I just have to do this.
978645 981148 No, no. Everything is fine.
981215 985085 We're just sad to see it go.<br />Pretty basket.
985886 988088 Honestly. Let it go!
998465 999766 That's the new one.
999833 1001835 New one?
1028194 1032833 Excellent work, everyone.<br />They're off to the cold of winter.
1033599 1036002 Well, that's that until next year.
1087921 1089590 Wow. I made it.
1091158 1092893 Welcome back.
1093293 1094828 A Winter Fairy.
1095495 1097264 You ready for the drop-off?
1097497 1100300 Come on. You did it yesterday.<br />You'll be fine.
1101068 1103270 All right then. Here we go.
1137771 1139039 Look out!
1145846 1147514 Sorry about that.
1151585 1152786 Oh, no.
1171605 1172639 Lord Milori.
1175442 1177110 And what happened here?
1177344 1181648 A bit of a bumpy landing.<br />It's only his second drop-off.
1181748 1185385 As long as the basket made it,<br />I'd say he did just fine.
1186320 1187354 How was the crossing?
1187421 1189790 Four bunnies,<br />two weasels, and a marmot.
1189857 1190924 And they all crossed safely.
1190991 1193794 Yes. I met up with them<br />on the north side.
1194695 1197464 The snowflakes<br />are looking quite beautiful.
1197531 1199433 No two alike.
1203871 1204905 No, no, no.
1204972 1207074 Ambitious.
1210811 1212279 Now that is odd.
1214014 1216517 It must have been left<br />in the basket by accident.
1217618 1218719 Return this to the Keeper.
1218785 1219853 The Keeper.
1219920 1223323 He can send it back to the Warm Side<br />with his next delivery.
1239306 1243310 It must have come from the Warm Side.<br />In one of the baskets.
1243744 1244945 Thanks.
1280080 1282216 That's the end of that chapter.
1283016 1284718 Boy, that's a beauty.
1284885 1287688 Flora and Fauna of the Fairies.
1289556 1293193 Put a period there,<br />then we are pretty much done.
1294228 1297197 Wait. I forgot to number the pages.
1297297 1300701 I'm going to have to start all over<br />on this large book.
1300767 1302202 -Keeper. Keeper!<br />-Yes, what...
1302336 1304705 The most amazing thing happened.<br />You'll never believe it.
1304771 1306373 Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.
1306440 1307641 I've never felt anything like it!
1307708 1310711 My friends didn't believe me,<br />but how could they because it's so...
1310777 1313313 Slow down. I can only listen so fast.
1313380 1315649 Yesterday, at the border, my wings.
1315716 1318752 They actually... They lit up.
1319586 1321154 It's happening again!
1325559 1327895 Well, I'll be a yeti's uncle.
1345512 1347781 In all my years.
1353921 1356957 Your wings. They're sparkling.
1357891 1359359 Like yours.
1360827 1362596 I've written about the sparkling,
1362663 1365999 but I've never seen the sparkling<br />with my own peepers!
1369036 1370571 Follow me.
1373340 1377144 Now, step the footsies on the snowflake.
1396830 1400367 Just put your wings into the light.
1418018 1419453 The mainland.
1446713 1447848 Oh, no.
1491925 1493260 Hello?
1493393 1494761 Hello.
1496263 1497264 Hello?
1503470 1506807 Two fairies born of the same laugh.
1507574 1510077 So that means...
1510143 1511545 You're my...
1511812 1513413 So we're
1515082 1516550 sisters.
1517451 1520888 Yes! And your wings are identical.
1521054 1522823 That is why they sparkle.
1531798 1533767 Jingles!
1536236 1539006 Oh, boy. Maybe you shouldn't do that.
1541842 1543477 I'm Tinker Bell.
1543577 1545245 I'm Periwinkle.
1545512 1547281 So you must have been at the border.
1547347 1549583 Yeah. I was hoping to see<br />the animals cross.
1549783 1551151 I guess I didn't see you.
1552052 1553387 Me either.
1554922 1555923 What?
1558825 1561061 I usually just wear them at home.
1563096 1564598 -Wow.<br />-Hello.
1564698 1566800 Keeper, are you in?
1566867 1568936 Yumping yetis, Lord Milori!
1569002 1570437 If he sees you, he'll send you back.
1570504 1572773 Keeper? Are you here?
1572840 1575175 Don't worry.<br />I'm going to take care of this.
1575943 1577010 Where are you?
1578846 1580614 Come back later!
1580814 1582049 Keeper?
1582115 1584384 Whoa, boy. Can't get that one back.
1584451 1586019 I need to speak with you.
1586086 1587621 It's important.
1588789 1590657 I'll be right back.
1592226 1594928 I'm right here, Lord Milori.
1594995 1596563 Did you receive that wing book?
1596630 1598465 You know, once upon a time,
1598532 1601802 you'd stop by just to say hello<br />and howdy-do.
1601869 1604505 I'm sorry. Hello.
1604838 1606173 Howdy-do?
1606940 1608575 Howdy-do.
1609176 1613113 This book has me worried.<br />What if a Warm Fairy brought it here?
1614982 1617951 Well, that might be nice,<br />then, meeting a Warm Fairy.
1618018 1620754 Especially one<br />with such good taste in books.
1620821 1622356 It's too cold.
1622422 1624591 Maybe if they were wearing a coat,
1624691 1626660 or one of them little sweater vests.
1626727 1628028 -They're nice.<br />-I'll remind you.
1628095 1629963 Crossing the border is forbidden.
1630030 1631732 There was a time when it wasn't.
1631798 1635536 The rule is there to keep<br />the fairies safe. That will never change.
1635602 1636603 But I...
1636670 1641141 If a Warm Fairy comes here,<br />you will send them back.
1642209 1643710 Of course.
1646013 1647347 Thank you.
1655189 1657324 Well, you heard the Lord Milori.
1657891 1660460 He said you must go back home.
1661962 1663497 Of course, he didn't say when.
1664698 1667734 Now, listen, you two,<br />it gets colder after the dark,
1667801 1671004 so it's best to get Tinker Bell<br />home before the first moonlight.
1671071 1672639 Thank you, Dewey.
1672706 1673774 Dewey?
1674608 1676043 That's his real name.
1676210 1678512 It's what my friends call me.
1680480 1681515 Thank you.
1681949 1682950 Dewey.
1684051 1685219 Dewey.
1685686 1689289 So, I'm a Frost Fairy. I frost things.
1689356 1692159 -I'm a Tinker. I...<br />-Tinker things?
1692226 1694294 Yep. I even made this coat.
1694361 1695863 -I like it.<br />-Thanks.
1695929 1696997 You're welcome.
1697064 1698131 Sisters.
1698532 1702569 It's amazing. The dust travels<br />all the way from the Pixie Dust Tree.
1702636 1704037 Kind of like you did.
1704104 1706240 ...Terence and I<br />barely escaped the pirate ship!
1706306 1708308 Is he your boyfriend?
1708775 1710711 So Lizzy loves fairies?
1710777 1713146 Yeah. She even built a fairy house.
1713213 1715516 That's how I met her.<br />You see, me and Vidia...
1720954 1723223 You collect lost things, too?
1723290 1725158 I call them found things.
1725225 1729530 I never knew I lost you<br />till I found you
1731698 1736937 And you'd never guess<br />how close you are to me
1738238 1741808 Now I want to<br />throw my arms around you
1741875 1745345 Tell a thousand tales<br />that will astound you
1745412 1750751 Everything about you<br />tells me this was meant to be
1750817 1755222 Don't you see?<br />I'm on your side
1755289 1759159 Let's take this ride
1759226 1762829 And together we're facing the world
1762896 1766266 Doing things nobody's done before
1766333 1769736 And the great divide
1769803 1773207 Doesn't seem so wide
1773273 1774508 Anymore
1774575 1775909 This is the Frost Forest.
1775976 1777711 Wow.
1777778 1778912 That's Gliss.
1781582 1783851 Come on, Spike. Practice.
1785052 1787354 Okay, okay. Practicing.
1787421 1790591 And that's Spike. She's a bit...
1797264 1799266 -Hi.<br />-Sisters?
1799333 1801435 Well, I think it's fantastic!
1801502 1805072 Wow, you two look exactly alike!
1805138 1808976 I mean, except for your clothes<br />and your hair and Peri's a bit more pale.
1809042 1811044 But your noses are very similar.
1811111 1814948 Forget their noses.<br />She's a Warm Fairy. In Winter!
1815382 1818385 You're right.<br />We got to show her around!
1819520 1822289 Let's take her ice sliding!<br />Come on, Spike!
1822356 1823824 You are going to love this!
1823891 1825158 It sounds fun.
1825225 1828195 Yeah. Great idea.<br />Push the Warm Fairy down a hill of ice.
1829696 1831198 Okay, well, wait for me, you guys.
1831532 1837771 And if you'll be there<br />beside me when I falter
1837838 1841642 Then whatever comes I know<br />we'll take it all in stride
1841742 1845012 Ready, set, slide!
1845345 1848615 I'm on your side
1848682 1851285 I'm on your side
1851351 1854755 Let's take this ride
1855289 1858825 And together<br />we're facing the world
1858892 1862296 Doing things<br />nobody's done before
1862362 1865766 And the great divide
1865832 1869436 Doesn't seem so wide
1869503 1870637 Anymore
1875075 1876643 I know. Favorite star?
1876710 1877811 Second star
1877878 1878946 -to the right.<br />-To the right.
1879613 1882583 Okay. Favorite drink?
1882649 1884084 Hot chamomile tea.
1884151 1885686 Iced chamomile tea!
1887120 1890290 Okay, my turn. How about favorite bug?
1890357 1893060 Bug? It's too cold for bugs over here,
1893126 1895996 but in one of Dewey's books,<br />I read about butterflies.
1896597 1899199 In Butterfly Cove,<br />there's hundreds of them.
1899266 1901368 It's in Summer. It's right over...
1904438 1906073 I guess you can't see it from here.
1907341 1909276 No. You can't.
1910210 1911612 What's it like over there?
1911678 1912713 Warm.
1913180 1915082 And the colors? The sounds?
1915148 1917217 All the animals. And the fish.
1917284 1918719 They swim in melted ice, right?
1918785 1919920 Water.
1921221 1922856 I wish...
1923757 1925726 I wish I could go there.
1930364 1931999 -Peri?<br />-Yeah?
1935169 1940040 I made it warmer over here.<br />Maybe I could make it colder over there.
1940307 1941642 Are you...
1942042 1943644 Are you saying I could cross?
1944578 1946547 -Yeah!<br />-Oh, Tink.
1947014 1948582 You could show me your world.
1948649 1950717 I could meet your friends.
1950784 1952319 Do you think I could see a butterfly?
1952386 1954254 There's a pretty good chance.
1959860 1961061 Tink?
1964698 1966266 -I can't fly!<br />-Tink!
1967768 1969269 Hold on. Hold on!
1971171 1972239 I'm slipping!
1976476 1979479 That's it, Fiona. That's it.
1980948 1982549 Are you girls all right?
1982983 1984685 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
1984985 1988255 Are you sure? Nothing broken?<br />Nothing bruised?
1988455 1990891 No. We're okay.
1991758 1993160 This time.
1993227 1995562 Lord Milori was right.
1996263 1999233 Crossing the border<br />is just too dangerous.
2000267 2001435 What are you saying?
2001502 2003070 I'm sorry, girls,
2003136 2007741 but I'm afraid this isn't going to work out<br />like you hoped.
2007908 2010277 We have to take Tinker Bell home.
2015382 2016717 Let's go, Fiona.
2032699 2033901 It's...
2034134 2035802 It's for your own good.
2065364 2066967 I can't watch, Fiona.
2068936 2071638 I promised myself<br />I wasn't going to do this.
2071705 2074608 Okay. Here's the plan.<br />Meet me here tomorrow.
2074875 2077777 Thank goodness. I thought<br />you were really saying goodbye.
2077844 2079947 No! I just met my sister<br />I never knew I had
2080013 2082916 and I'm going to say goodbye forever?<br />Are you kidding?
2082983 2084184 So...
2087855 2089523 Clank? Bobble?
2091824 2093060 Guys?
2103670 2105038 Oopsie.
2105672 2107541 Tink! You're back!
2108742 2110744 -Yes.<br />-Sorry!
2110811 2113180 We thought you were a troll.
2113247 2114248 A troll?
2114314 2116149 I knew we shouldn't have used<br />the troll stopper.
2116216 2117784 What if it was a troll?
2117851 2119620 You'd be saying something different,<br />wouldn't you?
2119686 2121154 Guys. It doesn't matter.
2121221 2122589 Oh, right.
2122890 2124091 I need your help.
2124157 2125926 Is it about a glacier?
2126760 2129930 No. But it's kind of a secret.
2130163 2131865 I don't want everybody to know.
2134835 2138405 I'm pretty sure these buttons will work,<br />but we're going to need more of them.
2138472 2141308 Aye, unless we use<br />a couple of acorn caps.
2141375 2142943 Right! Good idea.
2143010 2145279 Now where is that Clanky?
2145345 2147648 Yes, I'm right here.
2149449 2152119 I didn't tell everybody.
2152886 2156723 Just Fawn, Ro, Sil, Dess, and Vidia.
2157524 2160160 So, there's another you.
2160227 2162095 -Vidia!<br />-Yeah.
2162329 2163530 I've got a sister.
2164264 2165499 I told you!
2165566 2166733 Bust my bonnet.
2166800 2168669 -Amazing!<br />-It's fantastic!
2168735 2169937 I can't believe this is happening.
2170003 2171038 But how?
2171104 2173807 They were born of the same laugh!
2173874 2176777 Tell them, Tink,<br />what you told me and Bobble.
2177778 2179479 Her name's Periwinkle.
2179546 2183517 She's a Frost Fairy,<br />and she's just amazing.
2183584 2186119 I'm making this machine<br />so she can come here and meet you all,
2186186 2188522 and after that<br />we'll go straight to Queen Clarion!
2190691 2192626 Have you thought this through?
2192693 2196296 "Hi, Queen Clarion. Meet the Winter<br />Fairy I smuggled over the border."
2196363 2197731 Vidia!
2197798 2199833 When Queen Clarion<br />hears how we found each other,
2199900 2201068 and that we're sisters,
2201134 2203003 she will change Lord Milori's rule.
2203070 2204838 Of course she will.
2204905 2206573 She'd never want you to be apart.
2206640 2209409 It's like you found the perfect lost thing.
2210043 2212546 And I'm never going to lose her.
2212679 2214414 Well, then, let's get to work!
2214481 2215916 Just tell us what to do.
2215983 2216984 Great!
2217050 2218785 Okay. We need to place<br />that wheel right here.
2218886 2219887 Got you, Tink.
2219953 2221855 And let's get that<br />propped up over there.
2221922 2223257 I feel so tinkery.
2223323 2224858 -Clank, Bobble...<br />-Wait, wait.
2224925 2225993 Finish up the chassis?
2226059 2227261 Exactly.
2227327 2229029 -Come on, Clanky!<br />-Bobble!
2229096 2233267 Perhaps you and I are brothers!<br />It's possible.
2233333 2235369 We look almost exactly alike.
2244745 2245746 Anyone see you?
2246046 2247047 No.
2247114 2248715 I can't believe we're doing this!
2250484 2251818 So, did you bring it?
2251885 2253820 Yes.
2254555 2256190 Watch the branch.
2258158 2260093 Careful. More to the right.
2260160 2264431 For the record, we shouldn't be doing<br />this, whatever it is we're doing.
2265766 2268735 As ordered. One big block of ice.
2268802 2271438 Courtesy of our resident glacier fairy.
2271905 2273073 Hey.
2273240 2274608 So, what do you think?
2274675 2275909 It's perfect!
2278579 2281448 Are you sure<br />she's not luring you into a trap?
2292926 2295128 It's one of those...
2295195 2296997 Things we shouldn't be doing?
2297064 2298899 It's a snowmaker!
2298966 2301902 It makes snow!
2302202 2305806 Yep, this is your ticket<br />to the warm side of Pixie Hollow.
2306306 2307374 Wait a second.
2307441 2310277 This is crazy!<br />You don't even know if this thing works!
2310844 2312145 It works, all right.
2312212 2314281 Aye, we made it ourselves.
2315082 2317784 Of course you did. Just walk away.
2318952 2320354 How does it work?
2320420 2321522 Guys?
2321588 2323490 Pull.
2323657 2325425 Move this around here.
2329329 2331532 You might want to<br />step aside for this part.
2334668 2336103 They're serious.
2354188 2355222 Snow!
2355455 2356557 Wow.
2357524 2359793 You did it! You actually did it!
2364665 2366200 It's cold.
2367034 2368135 So?
2371872 2373073 Go, go on.
2373507 2374808 Live it, man.
2385419 2387221 Welcome, Miss Winkle.
2387287 2388455 Thank you.
2388522 2392259 All righty! Your tour begins<br />with the Autumn Forest.
2392326 2395562 Next it's a quick stop<br />in Springtime Square.
2395629 2397998 And finally, the Pixie Dust Tree,
2398298 2400968 which, as you know,<br />makes all fairy life possible.
2401034 2405105 Aye, that's where you'll be meeting<br />her majestiness, the queen.
2405572 2406573 The queen?
2407174 2408876 They're going to see the queen!
2408942 2410377 She's very wise.
2410444 2412312 And if we tell her we're sisters,
2412379 2414281 she'll change Lord Milori's rule.
2414348 2415883 That is so exciting!
2415949 2418986 Say hi for me, or curtsy,<br />or whatever it is you do.
2419152 2420187 Sure.
2420254 2421688 And bring me back an acorn. A big one!
2421755 2423290 -After you.<br />-Thank you.
2424758 2425926 Bye!
2427828 2431932 I can't believe I'm going to get an acorn!<br />Finally! That is so exciting!
2437804 2439072 Wow.
2443877 2448348 Just when we thought<br />life couldn't get much better
2450584 2455856 A wish we never knew<br />we made came true
2457057 2460260 Worlds that were apart<br />have come together
2460327 2462329 -There she is!<br />-She's so wintery.
2462396 2464831 We'll be friends<br />no matter what the weather
2464932 2466233 This is so exciting!
2466300 2467568 Wait for the signal.
2467634 2473640 Wait until you see the wondrous<br />things that we can do here with you
2473707 2476176 That's it. Operation Periwinkle in effect.
2478779 2480714 We're on your side
2480781 2484084 We're on your side
2485352 2487321 Let's take this ride
2487387 2489423 Let's take this ride
2492926 2495929 And together we're facing the world
2495996 2499333 Doing things nobody's done before
2499766 2503237 And the great divide
2503303 2505439 Doesn't seem so wide
2506907 2508408 Butterflies!
2511612 2513080 Surprise!
2514915 2516483 Your friends did all this?
2516550 2518252 They wanted to surprise you.
2518552 2522422 Everyone, this is Periwinkle, my sister.
2522589 2523657 This is so exciting.
2523790 2524892 -Oh, wow!<br />-Can you believe it?
2525058 2528896 Hello. It is nice to meet you.
2528962 2532533 I am Rosetta. This is...
2532599 2535569 She's a Winter Fairy.<br />She's not from the moon.
2535636 2538939 Oh, right. I know, I know.<br />I'm just so excited!
2539006 2540807 It's great to meet all of you.
2540874 2543677 This is so remarkable!<br />You two are sisters!
2543911 2545913 Yeah. A little fairy-to-fairy advice.
2545979 2549316 Tink can be tricky<br />to get along with at times.
2549616 2551218 Yeah. Look who's talking.
2551318 2553387 We can't believe you're over here!
2553453 2555222 So... Are you cold enough?
2555489 2557324 Yeah. It's perfect.
2561495 2563163 I nearly forgot.
2563230 2568101 This is for you.<br />It's called a periwinkle. Also.
2568402 2569670 Thank you.
2571271 2573173 I'll keep it forever.
2577411 2578579 Look at that!
2578645 2579746 It's frost.
2579813 2582850 She and her friends practice<br />in the Frost Forest. You should see it!
2582916 2585185 You should see Tink on ice skates.
2585252 2586954 She's a natural.
2587020 2589089 It's only because<br />you had that lost thing.
2589256 2591959 -She collects lost things, too?<br />-Yeah!
2592025 2593493 You guys are so alike.
2593560 2594561 I know.
2594628 2597564 Even our wings are identical.<br />That's why they sparkled.
2597664 2599032 -Let's show them.<br />-I don't feel so...
2599132 2600267 Periwinkle!
2600334 2601368 Is she all right?
2601435 2603170 I think she's getting a little too hot.
2603237 2605939 My wings, I can't feel them.
2607474 2609243 I think they're too warm.
2609476 2610911 Oh, the snowmaker!
2611245 2613080 It's running out of ice!
2613146 2614848 We have to get her back to the border!
2614915 2616884 Tink, what about the queen?
2616950 2618252 There's no time.
2618318 2620954 Clank, grab some ice.<br />We'll wrap her wings.
2622589 2624992 Be careful. Gentle. Easy.
2625359 2627427 Okay. Let's go. Hurry!
2628662 2630063 All together. All together.
2630130 2631465 All together.
2631532 2632833 Hurry!
2633734 2634902 We can do this!
2637504 2638672 Hurry!
2638872 2640374 Go, go, go!
2640807 2642843 Hold on. We're almost there.
2642910 2644745 Hurry! It's nearly out of ice!
2644811 2646146 Not much further.
2650184 2651885 Don't worry. We're almost there.
2651952 2654288 We're going to make it.<br />We're going to make it!
2656790 2658158 Let me help you.
2660227 2663564 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
2667601 2669837 Please, can you help her?
2673207 2674208 Tink.
2682883 2687754 Gently. Lift your wings.<br />Let the cold surround them.
2704004 2706907 You're okay. Your wings are okay.
2706974 2708709 Yeah. Yeah.
2709309 2711678 This is why we do not cross the border.
2712913 2717251 No, it could've worked!<br />We just needed a bigger piece of ice!
2717351 2720754 And when that was gone?<br />Your wings could have broken.
2721922 2727261 But they didn't. I'm fine.<br />Thanks to them.
2730364 2733534 The rule is there to protect you.<br />I'm sorry.
2733800 2736270 You two may never see<br />each other again.
2736336 2738705 Please don't do this.<br />We belong together.
2738772 2740174 We're sisters.
2742442 2744378 We were born of the same laugh.
2749616 2752586 All the more reason you should want<br />to keep each other safe.
2753620 2754988 Return home.
2759693 2761895 Come on, Tink. Let's go home.
2761962 2763163 No!
2764932 2768769 Lord Milori,<br />your rule will not keep us apart.
2768836 2769937 Tinker Bell.
2771338 2774975 This is not Lord Milori's rule. It's mine.
2775609 2776977 Queen Clarion?
2777711 2778946 I'm sorry.
2786987 2789223 You should get deeper into the cold.
2789289 2791491 Back to the north side of the mountain.
2889623 2892693 Speaking of sparkling,<br />we can conclude
2892759 2898332 that it spreads in a spiral<br />and circles the center.
2912412 2913647 Hello?
2914715 2915949 Hello?
2922689 2923690 Peri?
2934801 2937971 Queen Clarion. Why?
2939673 2940674 Tinker Bell.
2941375 2944878 Long ago,<br />when Pixie Hollow was very young,
2945779 2948248 two fairies met and fell in love.
2949950 2951685 One of them was a Winter Fairy...
2952352 2955055 ...and the other<br />was from the warm seasons.
2956056 2958725 The two fairies were enchanted<br />with each other.
2958792 2961595 And every sunset,<br />they met at the border...
2961795 2963797 ...where Spring touches Winter.
2964631 2968802 But as their love grew stronger,<br />they wished to be together...
2969069 2971405 ...and share each other's worlds.
2973574 2975843 So they disregarded the danger<br />and crossed.
2977878 2979546 One of them broke a wing.
2981815 2983717 For which there is no cure.
2984985 2987120 From that day forward,<br />Queen Clarion decreed
2987187 2989690 that fairies must never again<br />cross the border.
2990490 2993327 And I agreed that our two worlds
2994061 2996263 should forever remain apart.
2997764 2999967 And the two fairies?
3000767 3002269 What happened to them?
3005572 3007708 They had to say goodbye.
3031031 3032132 We saw the snow.
3032199 3033901 Queen Clarion, something's wrong!
3033967 3035836 The temperature,<br />it seems to be plummeting!
3035903 3037671 The hibiscus are halfway to hibernation!
3037738 3040040 Now, now, ministers, let's not panic.
3040107 3041308 Absolutely right.
3041375 3042776 Snow!
3044077 3045078 Heave!
3045145 3046180 Ho!
3046246 3048215 -Heave!<br />-Ho!
3048382 3049883 Put your muscle into it, Clanky!
3049950 3051418 I'm trying, Bobble!
3052386 3054588 What happened?<br />How did this get here?
3054655 3057824 We don't know, Miss Bell,<br />but it's stuck real good!
3057891 3060794 Aye, and it's making that thing bigger<br />by the minute!
3063230 3064698 Guys, down here!
3064765 3065799 -Come on!<br />-Got it!
3065866 3067034 Okay, push!
3069069 3071004 All together. All together!
3072439 3074575 Upsy-daisy.
3076810 3078111 We did it!
3078312 3080013 We did it!
3080080 3081215 It's over.
3081949 3083517 I don't think it is.
3085786 3087154 Oh, my goodness.
3087688 3089890 The seasons have<br />been thrown out of balance.
3089957 3091592 But if the temperatures<br />continue to drop,
3091725 3093894 it will freeze all of Pixie Hollow.
3096730 3099867 -Oh, no.<br />-Queen Clarion, the Pixie Dust Tree.
3101869 3103971 We must hope<br />the tree survives the freeze.
3104538 3106874 Otherwise there will<br />be no more pixie dust.
3107941 3110878 Life in Pixie Hollow will change forever.
3110944 3113480 And no fairy will ever fly again.
3114348 3117150 Hurry. We must do everything we can.
3118719 3122289 Grab as many as you can<br />and head for the Pixie Dust Tree!
3122456 3126126 Hurry, guys! This way!<br />Hop to it! That's it!
3132165 3133534 Snug as a bug.
3134635 3135769 Oh, no!
3143544 3145312 Come on, that's it.
3146213 3147648 Just a little faster.
3147714 3148982 That's it, fairies.
3149116 3152753 Lay the blankets along the branches,<br />as many as you can!
3153053 3155589 We must protect the Pixie Dust Tree!
3156023 3158058 -Miss Bell!<br />-Tink! Do you need any help?
3158125 3160194 No! This is my last run!
3160494 3162062 I'll meet you in the tree!
3170370 3171738 Everybody okay?
3172673 3176376 Great. There you go. Nice and toasty.
3176610 3178679 You guys just stay here and keep warm.
3178779 3182616 Everything's going to be fine.
3188789 3190324 It's still alive.
3195696 3197030 Peri.
3198232 3199733 Dewey, you've got to see this.
3199800 3201902 There must be something wrong<br />with the Pixie Dust Tree.
3201969 3203470 Now don't worry...
3204638 3205672 Careful.
3205739 3208275 I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
3211612 3212746 Oh, dear.
3222189 3227294 Okay, you might want to worry<br />just a little bit.
3230397 3231431 Tink?
3233400 3234768 Periwinkle!
3253954 3257090 Tinker Bell! Are you okay?
3257791 3259326 Why would you fly here?
3259393 3260494 I had to.
3260561 3262462 Your jacket. Put on your jacket.
3262529 3264097 Pixie Hollow's in trouble.
3264164 3266967 There's a freeze moving in,<br />and the Pixie Dust Tree is in danger.
3267034 3268902 That explains it.
3269369 3272306 The pixie dust here,<br />it already stopped flowing.
3272639 3274641 I think there's something you can do.
3275042 3277945 Your frost, it kept the flower alive.
3278812 3281148 Frost does that. It's like a little blanket.
3281215 3283750 It tucks the warm air inside<br />and keeps out the cold.
3286920 3290023 We could frost the Pixie Dust Tree<br />before the freeze hits it.
3290757 3293493 One question. What about our wings?
3293560 3296563 If it's a freeze,<br />it will be cold enough to cross.
3297998 3299533 Then what are we waiting for?
3306006 3307574 We're almost to the border!
3314381 3315649 The Autumn Woods.
3318685 3321355 The freeze. It's moving so fast.
3322122 3323457 Come on! We have to get to the tree!
3340007 3341375 That's it, Clanky.
3343277 3345979 Queen Clarion, it's not working.
3346046 3347681 The wind, it's too strong!
3353887 3355122 Tinker Bell.
3355189 3357424 Queen Clarion! They can help.
3357491 3361461 Our frost, it covers like a blanket.<br />It can protect the tree.
3367100 3368135 Do it.
3390691 3391692 Oh, no.
3391758 3393093 It's getting colder.
3393160 3395696 Let's hand out the blankets.<br />They'll keep us warm!
3395762 3397764 Hurry, Peri. Hurry!
3408342 3411111 That's it. There you go!<br />Make sure to cover your wings!
3411178 3414948 The tree! It's too big.<br />We're never going to make it.
3418385 3419620 I'm sorry.
3441842 3442843 Whoopsie! Ha!
3448949 3450117 Lord Milori.
3450184 3451518 We've come to help.
3451585 3453120 Now, you didn't think<br />I was going to let you
3453187 3455355 do this all by yourself, now did you?
3456990 3458992 The tree should be our top priority.
3459059 3462396 But any fairy we can spare<br />should try to frost the other seasons.
3463697 3466733 Start at the freeze line<br />and spread out to Spring and Summer.
3466834 3468669 The rest of you, cover the tree!
3476510 3478178 Oh, my goodness.
3478912 3480647 Look, Bobble! The snowy owls!
3486353 3487588 Thank you.
3487654 3489022 Stay warm.
3496029 3497064 Now!
3525626 3529062 We've done all we can. Join the others.
3540340 3543677 The freeze is upon us.<br />You must take cover.
3543744 3544745 Follow me.
3547080 3548649 I hope it works.
3549449 3550450 Tink!
3560861 3562496 Will everything be all right?
3562563 3565666 I don't know.<br />I've never seen anything like this.
3572105 3573540 Thank you, Milori.
3573674 3575242 Please, take cover.
3582683 3586019 Winter Fairies, stand guard.
3699833 3701268 What a beautiful sight.
3709109 3712246 It worked! It worked, Tinker Bell.
3712813 3714147 Thank goodness!
3719319 3720387 We did it.
3729463 3730564 Whoa!
3744945 3746280 Come on, everyone!
3749483 3750884 Tink! Come on!
3753554 3754688 Tink?
3755489 3757658 What's wrong?
3766767 3767901 Oh!
3771338 3774875 When you flew to Winter,<br />that's why you fell.
3777744 3779012 Oh, no.
3779079 3780514 Oh, Tinker Bell.
3780581 3781648 Tink.
3783317 3784885 Why didn't you tell me?
3786153 3787821 We had to save the tree.
3789089 3792359 Besides, there's no cure<br />for a broken wing.
3794194 3795929 I'm so sorry.
3807941 3810777 This happened<br />because we tried to keep you apart.
3812112 3813447 But never again.
3814281 3815616 You belong together.
3826326 3827594 It's getting warmer.
3828195 3829796 You should get back to Winter.
3832232 3833233 Yeah.
3839306 3842543 I'll be okay.<br />I'll meet you tomorrow at the border.
3847447 3848582 Sisters?
3849550 3850617 Sisters.
3860928 3861929 Jingles!
3903403 3905939 That's a new chapter.
3910444 3912513 Okay, that was amazing.
3912579 3914615 Miss Bell, you are fantastic!
3920020 3921922 Queen Clarion!
3921989 3925058 I didn't know they were going to do<br />the smoochy, smoochity.
3925125 3926627 Guess they're telling people now.
3943911 3944912 Next!
3949383 3951585 Maybe you should go first.
3952653 3953720 Next.
3953787 3955189 All right.
3957958 3959726 Would you look at that.
3963130 3964565 That feels good.
3974408 3976243 Look out! Runaway bunny!
3983083 3984685 -Sorry.<br />-It's okay.
3984985 3986320 Hey, little buddy.
3987588 3989556 From Dewey?
3989623 3991892 It's what my friends call me.
3992359 3994561 Wow!
3996630 3998599 I love your work.<br />I have so many questions for you.
3998665 4000767 Okay, you can let go of my hand now.
4005572 4006773 Hi.
4007307 4008375 Hello there.
4008442 4009476 I'm Sled.
4009543 4011245 Oh, my. That's perfect!
4013680 4015015 I'm Rosetta.
4015249 4017718 Rosetta. That's beautiful.
4018986 4020921 Oh, my.
4021788 4023991 Oh, Miss Gliss!
4024324 4025559 An acorn!
4025726 4027728 Biggest one we could find.
4027794 4028829 I love it!
4028896 4029997 She likes acorns.
4030063 4031164 Must be a Winter thing.
4031231 4032266 Not really.
4033467 4034468 Tink.
4035969 4037237 You ready?
4037304 4038305 Ready.
4052986 4054254 Lovely!
4107006 4111944 So, is it true that glaciers are stealthy?
4112011 4114548 You're sitting on one now, man.
4116917 4119086 Sneaky glacier.
