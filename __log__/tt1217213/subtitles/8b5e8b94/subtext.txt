2584208 2585918 SHE'S A NATURAL.
2586001 2588045 IT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAD THAT LOST THING.
2588212 2590923 - UH, SHE COLLECTS LOST THINGS, TOO?<br />- YEAH!
2591006 2592424 YOU GUYS ARE SO ALIKE.
2592508 2593509 I KNOW.

2705954 2707664 YEAH. YEAH.
2708290 2710626 THIS IS WHY WE DO NOT CROSS THE BORDER.
2711877 2716215 NO, IT COULD'VE WORKED!<br />WE JUST NEEDED A BIGGER PIECE OF ICE!
2716298 2719718 AND WHEN THAT WAS GONE?<br />YOUR WINGS COULD HAVE BROKEN.
2720886 2726225 BUT THEY DIDN'T. I'M FINE. THANKS TO THEM.
2729311 2732481 THE RULE IS THERE TO PROTECT YOU.<br />I'M SORRY.
2732773 2735234 YOU TWO MAY NEVER SEE<br />EACH OTHER AGAIN.
2735317 2737653 OH, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.<br />WE BELONG TOGETHER.
2737736 2739154 WE'RE SISTERS.
2741406 2743325 WE WERE BORN OF THE SAME LAUGH.
2748580 2751541 ALL THE MORE REASON YOU SHOULD WANT<br />TO KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE.
2752584 2753961 RETURN HOME.
2758674 2760842 COME ON, TINK. LET'S GO HOME.
2760926 2762135 NO!
2763887 2767724 LORD MILORI,<br />YOUR RULE WILL NOT KEEP US APART.
2767808 2768892 TINKER BELL.
2770310 2773939 THIS IS NOT LORD MILORI'S RULE. IT'S MINE.
2774564 2775941 QUEEN CLARION?
2776692 2777901 I'M SORRY.
2785951 2788161 YOU SHOULD GET DEEPER INTO THE COLD.
2788245 2790455 BACK TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.
2888595 2891640 SPEAKING OF SPARKLING,<br />WE CAN CONCLUDE
2891723 2897312 THAT IT SPREADS IN A SPIRAL<br />AND CIRCLES THE CENTER.
2898438 2899523 OH!
2911368 2912619 HELLO?
2913662 2914913 HELLO?
2921670 2922671 PERI?
2933765 2936935 QUEEN CLARION. WHY?
2938645 2939646 TINKER BELL.
2940355 2943859 LONG AGO,<br />WHEN PIXIE HOLLOW WAS VERY YOUNG,
2944734 2947195 TWO FAIRIES MET AND FELL IN LOVE.
2948905 2950657 ONE OF THEM WAS A WINTER FAIRY...
2951324 2954035 ...AND THE OTHER<br />WAS FROM THE WARM SEASONS.
2955036 2957664 THE TWO FAIRIES WERE ENCHANTED<br />WITH EACH OTHER.
2957747 2960542 AND EVERY SUNSET,<br />THEY MET AT THE BORDER...
2960750 2962752 ...WHERE SPRING TOUCHES WINTER.
2963587 2967757 BUT AS THEIR LOVE GREW STRONGER,<br />THEY WISHED TO BE TOGETHER...
2968049 2970385 ...AND SHARE EACH OTHER'S WORLDS.
2972554 2974806 SO THEY DISREGARDED THE DANGER<br />AND CROSSED.
2976850 2978268 ONE OF THEM BROKE A WING.
2980770 2982689 FOR WHICH THERE IS NO CURE.
2983940 2986067 FROM THAT DAY FORWARD,<br />QUEEN CLARION DECREED
2986151 2988653 THAT FAIRIES MUST NEVER AGAIN<br />CROSS THE BORDER.
2989446 2992282 AND I AGREED THAT OUR TWO WORLDS
2993033 2995243 SHOULD FOREVER REMAIN APART.
2996745 2998914 AND THE TWO FAIRIES?
2999748 3001249 WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?
3004544 3006671 THEY HAD TO SAY GOODBYE.
3029986 3031071 WE SAW THE SNOW.
3031154 3032864 QUEEN CLARION, SOMETHING'S WRONG!
3032948 3034783 THE TEMPERATURE,<br />IT SEEMS TO BE PLUMMETING!
3034866 3036618 THE HIBISCUS ARE HALFWAY TO HIBERNATION!
3036701 3038995 NOW, NOW, MINISTERS, LET'S NOT PANIC.
3039079 3040247 ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
3040330 3041748 SNOW!
3043041 3044042 HEAVE!
3044125 3045126 HO!
3045210 3047170 - HEAVE!<br />- HO!
3047337 3048838 PUT YOUR MUSCLE INTO IT, CLANKY!
3048922 3050382 I'M TRYING, BOBBLE!
3051341 3053552 WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DID THIS GET HERE?
3053635 3056763 WE DON'T KNOW, MISS BELL,<br />BUT IT'S STUCK REAL GOOD!
3056846 3059766 AYE, AND IT'S MAKING THAT THING BIGGER<br />BY THE MINUTE!
3062185 3063645 GUYS, DOWN HERE!
3063728 3064729 - COME ON!<br />- GOT IT!
3064813 3065981 OKAY, PUSH!
3068024 3069985 ALL TOGETHER. ALL TOGETHER!
3071403 3073530 UPSY-DAISY.
3075782 3077075 WE DID IT!
3077158 3078952 WE DID IT!
3079035 3080161 IT'S OVER.
3080245 3082289 UH, I DON'T THINK IT IS.
3084749 3086126 OH, MY GOODNESS.
3086668 3088837 THE SEASONS HAVE<br />BEEN THROWN OUT OF BALANCE.
3088920 3089963 BUT IF THE TEMPERATURES
3090046 3092632 CONTINUE TO DROP,<br />IT WILL FREEZE ALL OF PIXIE HOLLOW.
3095677 3098847 - OH, NO.<br />- QUEEN CLARION, THE PIXIE DUST TREE.
3100849 3102934 WE MUST HOPE<br />THE TREE SURVIVES THE FREEZE.
3103518 3105854 OTHERWISE THERE WILL<br />BE NO MORE PIXIE DUST.
3106896 3109816 LIFE IN PIXIE HOLLOW WILL CHANGE FOREVER.
3109899 3112444 AND NO FAIRY WILL EVER FLY AGAIN.
3113320 3116114 HURRY. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.
3117699 3121244 GRAB AS MANY AS YOU CAN<br />AND HEAD FOR THE PIXIE DUST TREE!
3121411 3125081 HURRY, GUYS! THIS WAY!<br />HOP TO IT! THAT'S IT!
3131129 3132505 SNUG AS A BUG.
3132756 3134633 OH, NO!
3142515 3144267 COME ON, THAT'S IT.
3145185 3146603 JUST A LITTLE FASTER.
3146686 3147937 THAT'S IT, FAIRIES.
3148063 3151733 LAY THE BLANKETS ALONG THE BRANCHES,<br />AS MANY AS YOU CAN!
3152025 3154569 WE MUST PROTECT THE PIXIE DUST TREE!
3154986 3156988 - MISS BELL!<br />- TINK! DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?
3157072 3159157 NO! THIS IS MY LAST RUN!
3159449 3161034 I'LL MEET YOU IN THE TREE!
3168917 3170418 EVERYBODY OKAY?
3171628 3175340 GREAT. THERE YOU GO. NICE AND TOASTY.
3175590 3177634 YOU GUYS JUST STAY HERE AND KEEP WARM.
3177759 3181596 EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.
3187769 3189270 L'£'$ STILL ALIVE.
3194651 3195985 PERI.
3197195 3198697 DEWEY, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS.
3198780 3200865 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG<br />WITH THE PIXIE DUST TREE.
3200949 3202033 NOW DON'T WORRY...
3202117 3203535 WHOA!
3203618 3204619 CAREFUL.
3204703 3207122 I'M SURE THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
3207247 3208248 OH!
3210583 3211710 OH, DEAR.
3221136 3226266 OKAY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORRY<br />JUST A LITTLE BIT.
3229394 3230437 TINK?
3232355 3233732 PERIWINKLE!
3252917 3256045 TINKER BELL! ARE YOU OKAY?
3256755 3258256 WHY WOULD YOU FLY HERE?
3258339 3259424 I HAD TO.
3259507 3261426 YOUR JACKET. PUT ON YOUR JACKET.
3261509 3263052 PIXIE HOLLOW'S IN TROUBLE.
3263136 3265930 THERE'S A FREEZE MOVING IN,<br />AND THE PIXIE DUST TREE IS IN DANGER.
3266014 3267849 OH, THAT EXPLAINS IT.
3268349 3271269 THE PIXIE DUST HERE,<br />IT ALREADY STOPPED FLOWING.
3271603 3273605 I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.
3274022 3276900 YOUR FROST, IT KEPT THE FLOWER ALIVE.
3277108 3280111 OH! OH! OH!<br />FROST DOES THAT. IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BLANKET.
3280195 3282697 IT TUCKS THE WARM AIR INSIDE<br />AND KEEPS OUT THE COLD.
3285867 3288995 WE COULD FROST THE PIXIE DUST TREE<br />BEFORE THE FREEZE HITS IT.
3289704 3292457 UH, ONE QUESTION.<br />WHAT ABOUT OUR WINGS?
3292540 3295543 IF IT'S A FREEZE,<br />IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO CROSS.
3296961 3298505 THEN WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
3304969 3306554 WE'RE ALMOST TO THE BORDER!
3313353 3314604 THE AUTUMN WOODS.
3317649 3320318 THE FREEZE.<br />IT'S MOVING SO FAST.
3321069 3322403 COME ON! WE HAVE TO GET TO THE TREE!
3338962 3340338 THAT'S IT, CLANKY.
3342257 3344926 QUEEN CLARION, IT'S NOT WORKING.
3345009 3346636 THE WIND, IT'S TOO STRONG!
3352851 3354060 TINKER BELL.
3354143 3356354 QUEEN CLARION! THEY CAN HELP.
3356437 3360441 OUR FROST, IT COVERS LIKE A BLANKET.<br />IT CAN PROTECT THE TREE.
3366072 3367115 DO IT.
3389637 3390638 OH, NO.
3390722 3392056 IT'S GETTING COLDER.
3392140 3394642 LET'S HAND OUT THE BLANKETS.<br />THEY'LL KEEP US WARM!
3394726 3396728 HURRY, PERI. HURRY!
3407322 3410074 THAT'S IT. THERE YOU GO!<br />MAKE SURE TO COVER YOUR WINGS!
3410158 3413912 THE TREE! IT'S TOO BIG.<br />WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT.
3417332 3418583 I'M SORRY.

3450531 3452075 NOW, YOU DIDN'T THINK<br />I WAS GOING TO LET YOU
3452158 3454327 DO THIS ALL BY YOURSELF, NOW DID YOU?
3455954 3457956 THE TREE SHOULD BE OUR TOP PRIORITY.
3458039 3461376 BUT ANY FAIRY WE CAN SPARE<br />SHOULD TRY TO FROST THE OTHER SEASONS.
3462669 3465713 START AT THE FREEZE LINE<br />AND SPREAD OUT TO SPRING AND SUMMER.
3465797 3467632 THE REST OF YOU, COVER THE TREE!
3475473 3477141 OH, MY GOODNESS.
3477225 3479644 LOOK, BOBBLE! THE SNOWY OWLS!
3479727 3480728 AH!
