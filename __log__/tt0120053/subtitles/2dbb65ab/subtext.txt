1070470 1072872 Russians are warming<br />to the angry rhetoric

1075942 1077977 Now a billionaire<br />oil magnate
1078010 1080313 and leader<br />of his own<br />political party,

1590422 1593826 But you want<br />Mother Russia, too,<br />Mr. Tretiak.
1593860 1597529 Three million on deposit<br />in a bank account<br />in Zurich. Agreed?
1599966 1601968 Yes.
1602001 1606405 And, uh, how long to get<br />your employer's agreement?
1606973 1608007 I'll ask.
1623756 1626158 Your offer<br />has inspired her.<br />I'll do it.
1628294 1630062 Bank account number<br />in Zurich.
1631263 1633065 Auf wiedersehen.<br />Bye, sonny.
1634000 1635101 TRETIAK: Bye-bye.
1636502 1639672 I really love this guy.<br />(CHUCKLES)
1643976 1645644 Too bad<br />we have to kill him.
1646145 1647446 Yeah, too bad.
1662795 1665664 WOMAN:<br />When the electrochemists<br />Pons and Fleischman
1665698 1668134 announced in 1989
1668167 1671303 that they had discovered<br />cold fusion,
1671337 1674606 a revolutionary process<br />of generating energy,
1675674 1679211 they were at first<br />acclaimed as geniuses
1679245 1681680 and then condemned<br />as charlatans.
1683315 1688354 The protocols<br />of cold fusion...<br />What are those? Drugs?
1688387 1690823 Could I have one?<br />My head's pounding.
1690857 1692825 She's boring<br />the life out of me.
1694927 1696662 They're for my heart.<br />Oh.
1698264 1701333 You have<br />very pretty eyes.<br />You're a pretty lady.
1702234 1704136 Who are you?<br />Me?
1704170 1706906 I'm here to do<br />an interview<br />with that Dr. Russell.
1706939 1709441 I'm gonna expose her<br />as a fraud.
1709475 1712144 You don't put any stock<br />in this cold fusion<br />mumbo jumbo, do you?
1712879 1714613 Actually, I do.<br />Really?
1714646 1716783 Dr. Emma Russell.
1724757 1725825 Oops.
1730629 1731697 Well...
1732498 1735567 I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1736402 1738104 Um, I'm actually<br />more interested
1738137 1741908 in what questions<br />you all have<br />about cold fusion,
1741941 1743642 so I thought we would<br />start with those.
1744510 1745677 EMMA: Any questions?
1749048 1750983 Please?<br />Yeah. Yeah, I have,<br />Dr. Russell.
1752284 1755454 Can you explain<br />the actual process<br />of fusion?
1755487 1756823 You know, the theory.
1757824 1759391 Yes. Oh, there it is.
1760793 1762829 This is the...<br />The apparatus.
1763963 1765097 And very simply,
1765865 1768600 when positively charged<br />deuterons
1768634 1770702 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode,
1771570 1773039 they cram together,
1773072 1776342 and there are millions<br />and millions of them<br />inside the cathode,
1776375 1780146 getting closer<br />and closer,<br />and then they fuse,
1780179 1782581 and they create energy<br />in the form of helium.
1782614 1786085 But I read somewhere<br />that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated,
1786118 1788654 so how do we know<br />it works?
1789588 1790722 Well, we don't.
1791790 1792859 Not yet.
1794060 1795962 But if you<br />remember Einstein,
1795995 1799231 he knew the theory<br />of relativity to be true
1799265 1800766 long before<br />he could prove it.
1800799 1803502 I mean,<br />he felt the truth.
1803535 1807940 And, uh, some of us<br />feel the same way<br />about cold fusion
1807974 1810376 because it's there.<br />It's in nature.
1810409 1815114 The raw, natural power<br />just waiting<br />to be harnessed.
1815147 1819551 And when we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire,
1819585 1821720 I mean, just imagine.
1823022 1827059 There's more energy<br />in one cubic mile<br />of sea water
1827093 1830362 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on earth.
1830396 1834233 I mean, you could<br />drive your car<br />55 million miles
1834266 1836802 on a gallon<br />of heavy water.
1836835 1838837 It would be<br />the end of pollution.
1839571 1842074 Warmth for<br />the whole world.
1843642 1846378 So why don't I, uh,<br />demonstrate for you
1847813 1851283 why other people<br />in the past have been<br />so unsuccessful.
1853119 1854486 They used very complex...

2009075 2011043 Tretiak's wrong.<br />She's not cagey.
2012178 2014546 She's not difficult.<br />She's just...
2015481 2016615 Eccentric.
2017449 2018584 She's innocent.
2025924 2027226 Maybe it's in her head.
2029295 2032431 She needs a poet.<br />An artist.
2034032 2038637 Someone who<br />understands truth.
2046445 2048013 She needs Thomas More.
2095327 2096528 (IN SOUTH AFRICAN ACCENT)<br />Do you like it?
2099531 2102534 What?<br />The sculpture.<br />Do you like it?
2104703 2107139 Oh...yes.
2108374 2109908 What do you love<br />about it?
2119951 2123922 The way it...glows.
2125991 2128126 And how the light...
2129228 2131197 ...holds him in silence,
2132898 2134366 taking care of him.
2136602 2138404 Yeah, that's what<br />I like about it.
2143008 2144543 Are you an artist?
2144576 2149448 No, just a traveler,<br />searching for purity.
2150949 2152618 What do you search for?
2152651 2153752 Energy.
2153785 2155187 Yes.
2158290 2160259 Have you ever been<br />on a long journey?
2161393 2163128 No, not really.
2165931 2169668 Perhaps I'll take you<br />to my home in Africa.
2171169 2175073 You should experience<br />the energy of<br />where all life began.
2181247 2184082 Sorry. I'm not<br />very good with people.
2188887 2190289 Me, neither.

2251683 2252784 You.
2253685 2257122 You're following me<br />or it's destiny.
2257155 2258457 Either way, it's weird.
2259991 2261226 Very weird.
2263862 2265063 Destiny then.
2275173 2276375 (BOTH LAUGHING)
2276408 2277743 This must<br />look strange.
2279778 2281212 It's, uh...
2281246 2283382 Something that I'm<br />working on...
2284650 2288119 ...a formula for...<br />Creating energy.
2289988 2291857 That you carry around<br />in your underwear?
2293759 2296862 (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I do.
2310308 2311643 How did you do that?
2313845 2315013 Magic.
2315881 2316982 Give it back.
2318049 2319918 It looks like Sanskrit.
2319951 2320986 Give it back.
2323789 2326425 I'm sorry. I just wanted<br />to watch you put it away.
2329260 2330862 What else do you<br />keep in there?
2332063 2333499 Nothing.
2333532 2334766 That's not true.
2336602 2338637 Can I get you<br />anything else?
2341407 2345744 Drink your wine.<br />Uh, Latour '57.
2347713 2351216 The Latour, sir,<br />is 400 pounds a bottle.
2355521 2357523 Then we'll have<br />two bottles.
2361359 2362661 There. You count it.
2368266 2372738 All these little tubes<br />and microbes and things.
2372771 2373905 Molecules?
2373939 2376007 Those, too.<br />Even better.<br />(LAUGHS)
2376041 2377809 Can I tell you<br />something?
2378777 2381379 What? You must.<br />Everything.
2381413 2382748 (WHISPERING)<br />It's a secret.
2383449 2384783 What is it?
2386718 2387886 I'm done.
2390856 2394726 My energy research...<br />I'm finished.
2394760 2397563 I mean, I still have<br />some sequencing that<br />I have to work out
2397596 2400799 to make sure that<br />it's safe, but I did it.
2402067 2404402 It's just been you<br />against the whole world,<br />hasn't it?
2405737 2408440 How have you done it<br />and stayed so positive?
2408474 2410075 The gift of faith.
2411977 2413845 To see...
2415714 2417048 Well...
2417082 2420519 To believe in something<br />that's all around us...
2421753 2424222 But hidden<br />from our sight.
2425591 2427759 That's a beautiful thought.
2427793 2430095 I can't believe<br />I'm telling you<br />all this.
2431262 2432664 I don't even know<br />your name.
2434099 2435300 Well, my name is...
2437235 2438970 I don't want to<br />tell you my name.
2439004 2440472 I don't want to do that.
2442641 2445310 I don't want to do that.<br />What difference<br />does it make?
2448079 2451216 What's your name?<br />Emma.
2451249 2455053 Emma. Now I know<br />everything about you.
2456855 2459124 Your...genius.
2461860 2463428 You have a weak heart.
2466932 2470836 You have beautiful dreams,<br />great courage.
2472070 2473872 You're not afraid<br />in this world.
2474706 2475874 You get that<br />from your father.
2479144 2481112 You can't cook<br />to save your life.
2482781 2484082 And you love fish.
2486518 2487819 I do love fish.
2489120 2490488 That's weird.
2491657 2492858 I want to try that.
2493559 2494926 No.<br />Yes.
2494960 2496962 No, I don't want you to.<br />Drink your wine.
2499464 2500632 Yes, I do.
2501933 2503201 What's your name?
2504770 2506572 My name is Thomas More.
2507472 2510876 I was named<br />after a saint
2512410 2515914 who died for his faith.
2517683 2518850 Okay.
2521452 2525523 Your work<br />is very dangerous...
2526391 2527693 ...and alive.
2529194 2530829 And I love your poems.
2531663 2533198 They move me.
2534766 2536702 But that's not<br />who you really are.
2538604 2542040 You're running away<br />from your past...
2542841 2544643 Your pain.
2544676 2548279 And yet you keep it<br />so close to you.
2551216 2554519 So you don't have<br />to be afraid<br />of who you are...
2556922 2558657 Because you're beautiful.
2617816 2619017 What are you doing?
2623655 2625924 (GRUNTS)
2637135 2638837 Oh, my God, you're...
2638870 2641773 You're bleeding.<br />What happened?
2641807 2643074 Don't know. I was...
2643942 2647212 Weeping and I slipped.
2647245 2649848 I was thinking of you.<br />I don't know.
2649881 2652083 Well, I...<br />I live right down<br />the street.
2652117 2653651 I could clean you up.
2655386 2657188 Why do you<br />cover your mouth<br />when you laugh?
2657222 2658289 I don't know.<br />Wait.
2663194 2664662 I'm glad that<br />it stopped bleeding.
2666664 2668033 You don't<br />need stitches.
2670268 2671602 (GLASS CLATTERS)<br />(LAUGHS)
2674873 2676641 We're going to have<br />to disinfect it, though.
2677743 2679210 You really are an angel.
2680746 2681847 You are.
2684816 2686084 This is going to hurt.
2687052 2688253 Ahhh!<br />(SCREAMS)
2688286 2689921 (LAUGHS) Oh, sorry.
2692590 2693658 I'm sorry.
2694726 2696027 Are you all right?<br />Yeah.
2697628 2699364 I'm sorry.<br />I was just joking.
2701332 2704335 I... I should go.
2704369 2707005 Oh, no.<br />Yes. You... You... I...
2708306 2709474 Take off your pants.
2710541 2711743 Pardon?
2711777 2713144 I mean, your sweater.
2716915 2719017 There's blood on it.<br />I'll wash it.
2724856 2726157 Very domestic.
2727725 2731362 There's blood<br />on your blouse as well.
2733899 2735166 I'll wash it.
2750448 2751582 Do you have any wine?
2764329 2768099 Um, I'm so overwhelmed<br />that you even noticed me.
2769500 2770668 How could I not?
2773104 2775440 You make me feel<br />so good.
2775473 2776842 I wish you...
2778243 2779811 I wish you<br />could understand.
2781880 2783048 I want you to know<br />who I am.
2801799 2803068 Oh, my heart.

2842707 2843875 I can't believe<br />this is happening.

5236399 5238801 she doesn't<br />leave Moscow alive.
5241704 5243138 TRETIAK: Mr. President.
5243171 5246609 As former vice minister<br />of energy and power,
5246642 5251314 I hear all manner<br />of schemes that provide<br />cheaper energy,
5251347 5255083 and, uh,<br />as our countrymen<br />freeze to death,
5255117 5258787 I've become aware<br />of a marvelous<br />new technology,
5258821 5261490 about which<br />I'm hopelessly<br />out of my league
5261524 5264393 from a scientific<br />viewpoint.
5264427 5267463 That's why<br />I brought our eminent<br />physicist here,
5267496 5270899 Dr. Lev Botvin from<br />the University of Moscow.
5270933 5273436 Before we are dazzled<br />by the good news,
5273469 5275571 let's dispense<br />with the bad.
5276639 5278807 What is the price<br />of this marvel?
5278841 5282110 The cost for research<br />and development<br />are there,

5305368 5307770 Where are you heading?
5307803 5310706 I thought<br />we'd drink some vodka<br />to get warmer.
5315811 5318213 Like the miracle<br />of socialism,
5318246 5320883 our miracle<br />of cold fusion failed.
5321784 5323486 But no matter.
5323519 5327356 We have sold<br />cold fusion to<br />President Karpov.
5327390 5331360 We will use the scandal<br />of its failure<br />to destroy him.

5333762 5335831 You're a man in a hurry,<br />Ivan Petrovich.

5337600 5339468 Not now, old witch.<br />We're working.
5340536 5342671 TRETIAK:<br />Yes. Think of it.
