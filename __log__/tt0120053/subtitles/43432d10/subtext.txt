47925 52514 Simon Magus was a magician<br />and a sorcerer...
52515 55599 in... um...
55600 57600 In Sumeria.
58690 61899 What happened<br />to Simon Magus, Bartolo?
61900 65024 Jesus' disciples<br />performed miracles.
65025 67569 When Simon Magus<br />saw the miracles...
67570 71114 he offered Peter gold<br />for God's powers.
71115 73075 How did Peter respond...
74410 75660 John Rossi?
78081 79291 Stand up!
85505 87048 Answer, John Rossi.
89050 90552 That's not my name.
91636 94221 You and all<br />the other bastards...
94222 95890 lucky enough to be here...
95891 99476 children of sin,<br />spawn of the damned...
99477 103230 are all named for saints...
103231 107819 saints who are disciplined,<br />saints who are chaste.
108820 112239 You are named<br />for John Baptist Rossi...
112240 115410 a Capuchin priest who<br />gave away all his possessions.
118079 121373 A man who had nothing,<br />like you.
121374 122959 Now what is your name...
124127 126254 you ungrateful cur?
139017 140769 Your name, boy!
143522 145689 Have you lost your tongue?
145690 147609 What is your name?
155033 157117 All the girls...
157118 160871 will remain locked<br />in their dormitory...
160872 164250 and no food<br />will be served to any boy...
164251 169005 until you acknowledge<br />your namesake before God.
192279 195282 Food! Food! Food!<br />Food! Food! Food! Food!
237073 239159 Yes. Yes.
242495 246916 They should name you<br />Simon Magus, the magician.
246917 248417 No.
248418 250879 Simon... Templar.
261932 263532 Agnes!
265310 266770 Agnes!
273109 274444 Agnes!
284788 285914 Agnes!
294047 296215 When they catch you,<br />they'll cane you.
296216 298634 Won't happen,<br />'cause we're leaving tonight...
298635 301345 this hearty brotherhood,<br />on a crusade.
301346 303764 That's why I risked everything,<br />Agnes, my love...
303765 305516 to bid you farewell.
305517 308060 I can't leave you behind<br />without a kiss. Can I?
308061 310272 Hey, watch this.
327414 328706 We've lost some girls!
328707 331250 The girls are missing!
331251 333377 There are girls missing!
333378 334629 Come on, boys!
343471 346016 Wait, John Rossi.<br />My kiss.
352480 354149 There he is! Get him!
357694 360488 Aah!
373793 374960 October 3.
374961 377291 Entering foyer<br />of Tretiak industries.
377600 380100 Heavy security on elevators.
380300 381900 Guards in uniform.
381968 385555 Elevator to vault on 26th floor<br />requires separate passkey.
386723 388016 Maybe use stairs.
388850 390227 No traffic there.
391811 393230 October 4.
394064 395898 Personal tidbits.
395899 399527 Tretiak's former partner<br />died suddenly in 1995.
399528 402656 It left Tretiak as sole owner<br />of a gas and oil empire.
404824 408119 Tretiak's first son killed<br />in car crash five years ago.
409829 411080 Who are you?
411081 413582 Vehicle was<br />driven by younger son Ilya...
413583 414875 now 27.
414876 416627 Wife now lives in Geneva...
416628 418546 following assassination<br />attempt in 1996.
418547 421423 I am... Ivanovanovitch.
421424 422800 October 5.
422801 426011 Ilya spent most of today<br />in Cafe Eldorado...
426012 427179 with bandito buddies.
427180 430391 Gangster rap, coffee,<br />flirting with teenage girls.
430392 433895 Small firearms in coats.<br />Machine pistols in cars.
513183 515935 There were<br />three great empires...
515936 520899 that dominated the world both<br />culturally and militarily...
521900 526445 Rome, Constantinople,<br />and Russia.
526446 528406 All three have fallen.
529241 531950 Only one can be restored...
531951 535955 and only one man<br />can restore it...
535956 538875 Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!
562649 565694 Friends...<br />countrymen...
566319 567529 Russians!
574452 578582 You people<br />here in this room...
579666 581918 are the cream of Russia...
582711 587548 and the whole nation<br />is listening with us.
587549 591135 But why do you all<br />listen to me rave?
591136 593220 Set aside my oil company...
593221 595931 forget about<br />my best-selling book...
595932 600603 and all I am is a lunatic...
600604 604440 haunted by the fantasy<br />of an empire...
604441 608862 that reclaims her former might,<br />her former size.
612991 619246 All I am is a poet<br />spinning rhymes of a Russia...
619247 624335 not cut off at the knees,<br />but armed to the teeth.
624336 630467 Not ridiculed, but revered.
632928 635471 No! More than revered!
635472 636973 Feared!
646816 650986 But who am I<br />to dazzle you with this dream?
650987 652279 All I've done is...
652280 655324 How does it look<br />for the leader's son...
655325 657952 to walk out<br />when the leader speaks?
657953 659453 You'd prefer<br />the leader's son...
659454 662958 to piss his pants on live TV?<br />Hmm?
664626 668004 And still the people<br />freeze to death!
686523 687983 I love this country.
822158 824827 I don't speak Russian.
824828 827538 In that case, stand up...
827539 829499 put your hands<br />behind your head...
830083 832335 and turn around slowly.
837007 840468 Wrong place for a condom.<br />Take it off.
846933 850144 Listen,<br />if I give this to you...
850145 852105 you'll give it to your daddy.
852856 855774 What's he gonna give you?<br />Not even a Christmas bonus.
855775 859403 The guy I'm stealing this for<br />will give me $1 million.
859404 861447 If we go in partners,<br />we'll split 50-50.
861448 863949 Half a million hard currency.
863950 866660 Think of the drugs you could buy<br />with that much cake.
866661 870122 You'll be discoing<br />for a decade in Moscow, mate.
870123 872458 I don't need your small change.
872459 874085 That's your first problem.
875003 876630 Here is your second.
877631 880008 Microchip... please.
882093 883636 Freeze!
883637 885805 Sorry. Guns make me nervous.
886723 889309 Suck me... sideways.
921842 924593 Aah! Uhh!
924594 927556 Uh! My eyes! Ohh!
946992 948535 Give it up!
954916 956960 You got no place to go!
971641 972767 A goddamn button!
981902 984279 Back of the building!<br />Come on!
997042 998334 Where's the body?
998335 1000712 No body.<br />Just some guy in rags.
1066194 1068194 As the bitter chill of winter...
1068195 1069989 descends on Moscow...
1069990 1072408 Russians are warming<br />to the angry rhetoric...
1072409 1074993 of former communist boss<br />Ivan Tretiak.
1074994 1077663 Now a billionaire oil magnate...
1077664 1079707 and leader<br />of his own political party...
1079708 1082710 Tretiak predicted that the civil<br />unrest engulfing Russia...
1082711 1087047 will only worsen, unless<br />Reformist President Karpov...
1087048 1088883 can overcome<br />the heating-oil shortage...
1088884 1091970 that has already killed<br />scores of Russians.
1103273 1104733 What beautiful work.
1113200 1116410 Ah. Cloisonne.
1116411 1117578 It is old.
1117579 1119789 Yes.<br />It belonged to my grandmother.
1123752 1124961 Please.
1130300 1133845 Tonight I feel like<br />the oldest person on this plane.
1135263 1138891 My husband, he's sending me<br />to England to live...
1138892 1140935 until things change.
1140936 1144772 You are married<br />not even a year...
1144773 1147234 and already this bastard<br />has a girlfriend?!
1148276 1149610 I am sorry.
1149611 1151112 It's not my business.
1153949 1156993 How come you know<br />so much about me?
1158036 1159329 It is a gift.
1161456 1165501 I'm Martin de Porres.<br />I am from Spain...
1165502 1167461 but I'm named<br />for a Peruvian saint...
1167462 1170631 who could cure<br />the sick or the injured...
1170632 1172259 by the laying of hands.
1184479 1186814 Hmm.<br />He's the same build...
1186815 1189233 as the description<br />the Russians gave us...
1189234 1190901 but he doesn't<br />sound like an Aussie.
1190902 1192112 No.
1195615 1197534 Could be faking it.
1205166 1206333 X-rays are clear.
1206334 1208961 He hasn't swallowed<br />the microchip. Anything?
1208962 1211797 You English with<br />your chips, your fish and chips.
1211798 1213257 On the airplane, I had chicken.
1213258 1215467 Van Gogh theft, Netherlands.
1215468 1217595 Last year. Same eyes.
1217596 1219389 Different chin.
1262974 1264518 Halcyon Hotel, guv.
1273276 1275236 Stand up!
1275237 1277488 What is your name?!
1277489 1279032 Answer the question!
1281493 1283693 What is your name?! Hey!
1289626 1291626 Hey Lou, the microchip arrived.
1291628 1293228 I put the dough in your Swiss account.
1293230 1295230 Sorry I didn't get back<br />to you about that diamond.
1295240 1296840 Moscow's like Dodge City right now.
1296842 1299510 All them greedy Commies have<br />turned into crazy capitalists.
1299511 1301887 It's disgusting.<br />It's made 'em sloppy.
1301888 1304218 One or two more easy scores<br />like this last one...
1304220 1306520 - I top 50 mil, I'm outta the game.<br />- I heard that before.
1306522 1309022 Not from me.<br />I don't know nuttin'.
1309024 1310523 You don't believe me?<br />Try and find me.
1310524 1311984 - Fuck you, Lou.<br />- See yourself.
1318071 1319948 Can't seem to break 50.
1370999 1373375 "One million U.S. dollars..."
1373376 1374960 "nonrefundable..."
1374961 1376879 "reserves you a quiet table..."
1376880 1382301 "at a romantic little spot<br />in Berlin called Tempelhof..."
1382302 1385304 "which has<br />a cozy transit lounge."
1385305 1387890 "To get inside, you walk<br />through the metal detectors..."
1387891 1390267 "and I walk through<br />the metal detectors."
1390268 1394396 "Since you know I'm not armed,<br />and I know you're not armed..."
1394397 1397359 "we can both fall in love,<br />and nobody gets hurt."
1410747 1412414 I can't see him.
1412415 1414959 Then look for him.
1414960 1418128 You have<br />a long and beautiful cane...
1418129 1420465 along with your beautiful eyes.
1423051 1425719 That photograph<br />doesn't do you justice.
1425720 1427263 Who are you?
1427264 1429014 My name is Bruno Hautenfaust.
1429015 1432351 I was named for a saint<br />who was a very wealthy man.
1432352 1434520 Had the wine, women, songs...
1434521 1438315 then took a vow of poverty<br />and became a hermit...
1438316 1441402 went to live in the forest...<br />in the nude.
1441403 1442904 Please leave.
1444573 1447449 I represent<br />the professional you hired.
1447450 1449451 I'm his business manager.
1449452 1451412 I speak for him.
1451413 1453581 We don't deal<br />with underlings.
1453582 1455417 Come on, Father. Let's go.
1456459 1459920 Wait. Sit down.<br />Listen and learn.
1459921 1461464 Ah. Youth.
1465969 1468095 Who runs this thief?
1468096 1471265 CIA? MI-6? Libya?
1471266 1473142 He's not a race car.<br />Nobody runs him.
1473143 1474518 He's an independent contractor.
1474519 1478314 Good. Then no one<br />will mind if I kill him.
1478315 1480107 Oh, yes.
1480108 1484820 I can have a man killed<br />and stroll away like that...
1484821 1486447 even with metal detectors...
1486448 1488867 even in this transit lounge.
1490493 1493621 Oh, it's so early.
1493622 1495665 You guys wanna get coffee<br />or something?
1497167 1498460 Sure.
1502547 1504507 Be quiet.
1504508 1506884 What is it<br />you request of my employer?
1506885 1509386 Do you know<br />what cold fusion is?
1509387 1510888 Of course.
1510889 1513140 It's the theory...
1513141 1515809 of nuclear fusion<br />at room temperature...
1515810 1516977 free energy forever.
1516978 1518312 Yes.
1518313 1519480 Kaffee?
1519481 1520649 Klein, bitte.
1522526 1526362 As far as science goes,<br />it ranks just above astrology.
1526363 1528364 Those who claim to<br />have achieved the experiment...
1528365 1530574 have never been able<br />to duplicate it.
1530575 1531910 Until now.
1533745 1537831 There is an electrochemist<br />working at Oxford.
1537832 1540251 We believe<br />that this good lady...
1540252 1543212 made a breakthrough<br />in cold fusion.
1543213 1547341 Your employer<br />will obtain the formula for me.
1547342 1551178 He's very busy,<br />and you are very boring.
1551179 1553055 Your offer must inspire him.
1553056 1555683 This woman<br />has repeatedly avoided...
1555684 1559562 my agents' attempts<br />to find the formula.
1559563 1561690 She's cagey, difficult.
1563108 1565402 Maybe your agents are stupid.
1569489 1573576 I think this inspiration would<br />cost you three million dollars.
1573577 1575911 Ridiculous.
1575912 1580708 Why? You will have<br />the world market in energy.
1580709 1583210 Cost you a nickel<br />for every million you make.
1583211 1584545 His deposit should go...
1584546 1587756 Hey. It is not for me.
1587757 1589300 It is for mother Russia.
1589301 1593262 But you want mother Russia,<br />too, Mr. Tretiak.
1593263 1597058 Three million on deposit<br />in a bank account in Zurich. Agreed?
1599311 1600936 Yes.
1600937 1606275 And... How long to get<br />your employer's agreement?
1606276 1607527 I'll ask.
1622959 1624585 Your offer has inspired her.
1624586 1625754 I'll do it.
1627464 1629716 Bank account number in Zurich.
1630634 1632593 Auf Wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.
1632594 1634429 Bye-bye.
1635931 1640227 I really love this guy.<br />Ha ha ha!
1643396 1645481 Too bad we have to kill him.
1645482 1646942 Yeah, too bad.
1662082 1664917 When the electrochemists<br />Pons and Fleischman...
1664918 1667461 announced in 1989...
1667462 1670714 that they had discovered<br />cold fusion...
1670715 1675052 a revolutionary process<br />of generating energy...
1675053 1678597 they were at first<br />acclaimed as geniuses...
1678598 1681476 and then condemned<br />as charlatans.
1682686 1685688 The protocols of cold fusion...
1685689 1687147 What are those? Drugs?
1687148 1690317 Could I have one?<br />My head's pounding.
1690318 1692487 She's boring the life<br />out of me.
1694322 1696408 - They're for my heart.<br />- Oh.
1697576 1700870 You have very pretty eyes.<br />You're a pretty lady.
1700871 1703372 - Who are you?<br />- Me?
1703373 1705916 I'm here to do an interview<br />with that Dr. Russell.
1705917 1708669 I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.
1708670 1711672 You don't put any stock in<br />this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?
1711673 1713841 - Actually, I do.<br />- Really?
1713842 1717095 Dr. Emma Russell.
1723476 1725478 Oops.
1730025 1735654 Well, I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1735655 1737656 I'm actually more interested...
1737657 1741202 in what questions you all have<br />about cold fusion...
1741203 1743370 so I thought we would<br />start with those.
1743371 1745498 Any questions?
1747792 1748918 Please?
1748919 1750462 I have, Dr. Russell.
1751505 1754715 Can you explain<br />the actual process of fusion...
1754716 1756383 you know, the theory?
1756384 1759261 Yes. Oh, there it is.
1759262 1763307 This is the... the apparatus.
1763308 1764725 And very simply...
1764726 1768020 when positively charged<br />deuterons...
1768021 1771023 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode...
1771024 1772525 they cram together...
1772526 1776111 and there are millions of them<br />inside the cathode...
1776112 1779532 getting closer and closer,<br />and then they fuse...
1779533 1781742 and they create energy<br />in the form of helium.
1781743 1783369 But I read somewhere...
1783370 1785162 that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated...
1785163 1788999 so how do we know it works?
1789000 1791210 We don't.
1791211 1792420 Not yet.
1793547 1795422 But if you remember Einstein...
1795423 1798592 he knew the theory<br />of relativity to be true...
1798593 1800469 long before he could prove it.
1800470 1802305 I mean, he felt the truth.
1802722 1805891 And, uh, some of us<br />feel the same way...
1805892 1807142 about cold fusion...
1807143 1809645 because it's there.<br />It's in nature...
1809646 1814441 the raw, natural power<br />just waiting to be harnessed.
1814442 1818904 When we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire...
1818905 1821241 I mean, just imagine.
1822367 1826412 There's more energy<br />in one cubic mile of seawater...
1826413 1829290 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on earth.
1829291 1833419 I mean, you could drive<br />your car 55 million miles...
1833420 1835921 on a gallon of heavy water.
1835922 1838841 It would be the end<br />of pollution...
1838842 1841428 warmth for the whole world.
1842971 1846849 So why don't I demonstrate<br />for you...
1846850 1850645 why other people in the past<br />have been so unsuccessful?
1852522 1854024 They used very complex...
1855817 1858194 November 17, 11:30 a.m.
1858195 1860863 Entering flat<br />of Dr. Emma Russell.
1860864 1862157 High Street, Oxford.
1863200 1866243 No alarms on outer doors.<br />Strange.
1866244 1867913 No messages.
1873335 1874628 Shelley Monument.
1877547 1878882 Entering bathroom.
1879633 1881134 Books.
1883595 1884846 More books.
1888725 1891436 Walls covered<br />with reminder notes.
1893563 1894689 Poetry.
1908119 1908959 Ah.<br />Dad.
1943321 1945573 "Stop and talk to Shelley<br />every day.
1945574 1948201 "How can I love<br />a man named Percy?"
1952080 1954081 "Isn't there<br />someone in the world...
1954082 1956167 "who can consume me like that."
1956168 1959462 Magic. Romantic.
1967637 1968721 No recent applications.
1968722 1970807 "Cold fusion notes."
1982235 1984445 "Although I pass the<br />Shelley Monument every day...
1984446 1986823 "its sadness strikes me<br />every time."
1988200 1991368 "I feel a very personal loss<br />when I look at it.
1991369 1993455 "So much pain<br />and so much passion."
1998919 2001504 "To give light to them<br />that sit in darkness...
2001505 2003048 "and in the shadow of death."
2004966 2007635 "Luke 1; verse 79."
2007636 2010680 Tretiak's wrong.<br />She's not cagey.
2011848 2014808 She's not difficult.<br />She's just...
2014809 2016144 eccentric.
2016853 2018897 She's innocent.
2025487 2026655 Maybe it's in her head.
2028198 2032035 She needs a poet...<br />an artist...
2033620 2035538 someone who...
2035539 2038375 understands truth.
2045924 2047759 She needs Thomas More.
2094723 2096057 Do you like it?
2098310 2099351 What?
2099352 2102606 The sculpture. Do you like it?
2104065 2105145 Oh... yes.
2107652 2109571 What do you love about it?
2119331 2120281 The way it... glows.
2125337 2128589 And how the light...
2128590 2131259 holds him in silence...
2132344 2134429 taking care of him.
2136139 2138725 That's what I like about it.
2142437 2143812 Are you an artist?
2143813 2149402 No. I'm just a traveler<br />searching for purity.
2150361 2153155 - What do you search for?<br />- Energy.
2153156 2154156 Yes.
2157786 2160746 Have you ever been<br />on a long journey?
2160747 2162582 No, not really.
2165418 2168086 Perhaps I'll take you<br />to my home...
2168087 2170339 in Africa.
2170340 2172967 You should<br />experience the energy...
2172968 2174803 of where all life began.
2180641 2183770 Sorry.<br />I'm not very good with people.
2187899 2189693 Me, neither.
2218013 2221056 "I see my angel<br />for the first time...
2221057 2224227 "know my purpose,<br />feel my birth..."
2225770 2229106 "hear, at first faintly,<br />then distinctly...
2229107 2231610 "the sweet strains<br />of our union..."
2232861 2236405 "Our love heats up<br />the cold universe...
2236406 2239283 "and gives my tired,<br />desperate hope..."
2239284 2242203 "purified by our kisses...
2242204 2245040 "are eternally healed."
2246708 2248042 Do you like it?
2248043 2250377 Who did you write it for?
2250378 2252922 You.
2252923 2256509 You're following me,<br />or it's destiny.
2256510 2259094 Either way, it's weird.
2259095 2260680 Very weird.
2263266 2264809 Destiny then.
2275695 2277531 This must look strange.
2279282 2280533 It's, uh...
2280534 2283661 something that I'm working on...
2283662 2285413 a formula for...
2286456 2288667 creating energy.
2289292 2291419 That you carry around<br />in your underwear?
2293129 2296466 Yeah, I do.
2309396 2311273 How did you do that?
2313275 2313995 Magic.
2315485 2317236 Give it back.
2317237 2318821 It looks like Sanskrit.
2318822 2320824 Give it back.
2323285 2326246 I'm sorry. I just wanted<br />to watch you put it away.
2328498 2330709 What else do you keep in there?
2331543 2332668 Nothing.
2332669 2334129 That's not true.
2335839 2338633 Can I get you anything else?
2341178 2345390 Drink your wine.<br />Latour '57.
2347058 2350604 The Latour, sir,<br />is $400 a bottle.
2354858 2357068 Then we'll have two bottles.
2360363 2362157 There. You count it.
2368371 2371916 All these little tubes<br />and microbes and things.
2371917 2373334 Molecules?
2373335 2375503 Those, too.
2375504 2378214 Can I tell you something?
2378215 2380299 What? You must. Everything.
2380300 2382885 It's a secret.
2382886 2384095 What?
2386056 2387599 I'm done.
2390268 2393521 My energy research...<br />I'm finished.
2393522 2396982 I still have some sequencing<br />that I have to work out...
2396983 2400237 to make sure that it's safe,<br />but I did it.
2401488 2405074 It's just been you against<br />the whole world, hasn't it?
2405075 2407785 How have you done it<br />and stayed so positive?
2407786 2409538 The gift of faith.
2411373 2413667 To see...
2415085 2416460 Well...
2416461 2420131 to believe in something<br />that's all around us...
2421174 2424302 but hidden from our sight.
2425053 2426887 That's a beautiful thought.
2426888 2429015 I can't believe<br />I'm telling you this.
2430684 2433269 I don't even know your name.
2433270 2434855 Well, my name is...
2436565 2438065 I don't want to tell you.
2438066 2440235 I don't want to do that.
2442153 2444865 I don't want to do that.<br />What difference does it make?
2447242 2448410 What's your name?
2449703 2451996 - Emma.<br />- Emma.
2451997 2454791 Now I know<br />everything about you.
2456126 2458753 Your... genius.
2460797 2462591 You have a weak heart.
2466303 2470348 You have beautiful dreams,<br />great courage.
2471474 2474059 You're not afraid in this world.
2474060 2476062 You get that from your father.
2478398 2480942 You can't cook<br />to save your life...
2482152 2483486 and you love fish.
2485989 2487616 I do love fish.
2488700 2490951 That's weird.
2490952 2492620 I want to try that.
2492621 2494246 - No.<br />- Yes.
2494247 2496291 I don't want you to.<br />Drink your wine.
2498793 2500003 Yes, I do.
2501338 2502672 What's your name?
2504257 2506759 My name is Thomas More.
2506760 2510430 I was named after the saint...
2511973 2515352 who died for his faith.
2517229 2518396 OK.
2520941 2522150 Your work...
2523652 2527239 is very dangerous...<br />and alive...
2528532 2530283 and I love your poems.
2531076 2532494 They move me.
2534287 2536164 But that's not<br />who you really are.
2538166 2539626 You're running away from...
2540710 2543421 your past and your pain...
2544047 2547759 and yet you keep it<br />so close to you.
2550387 2554224 So you don't have to be afraid<br />of who you are...
2556393 2558311 because you're beautiful.
2617162 2618496 What are you doing?
2636181 2641227 Oh, my God,<br />you're bleeding. What happened?
2641228 2643521 Don't know. I was...
2643522 2646774 weeping, and I slipped.
2646775 2649235 I was thinking of you.<br />I don't know.
2649236 2651529 I live right down the street.
2651530 2653323 I could clean you up.
2654658 2656617 Why do you cover your mouth<br />when you laugh?
2656618 2657953 - I don't know.<br />- Wait.
2662499 2664084 I'm glad it stopped bleeding.
2666169 2667546 Don't need stitches.
2674511 2677346 We're gonna have<br />to disinfect it, though.
2677347 2679974 You really are an angel.
2679975 2681226 You are.
2684521 2686480 It's gonna hurt.
2686481 2687857 - Aah!<br />- Aah!
2687858 2689943 Oh, sorry.
2692153 2695114 I'm sorry. Are you all right?
2695115 2697074 Yeah.
2697075 2699035 I'm sorry. I was just joking.
2700537 2702162 I...
2702163 2704331 - I should go.<br />- Oh, no.
2704332 2706835 Yes. You... you... I...
2707878 2709962 Take off your pants.
2709963 2711172 Pardon?
2711173 2712799 I mean, your sweater.
2716386 2719389 There's blood on it.<br />I'll wash it.
2724394 2725770 Very domestic.
2727147 2731067 There's blood<br />on your blouse as well.
2733403 2735030 I'll wash it.
2749461 2751004 Do you have any wine?
2762766 2768562 I'm so overwhelmed<br />that you even noticed me.
2768563 2770106 How could I not?
2772776 2774485 You make me feel so good.
2774486 2775695 I wish you...
2777697 2779366 I wish you could understand.
2781284 2784120 I want you to know who I am.
2801179 2802430 Oh, my heart.
2803515 2805975 Don't disappear.<br />I'll be right back.
2805976 2808854 Calm it down.
2809604 2811522 Bring it round.
2811523 2815569 Too way high up, your street.
2817320 2820364 I can see...
2820365 2822992 like nothin' else...
2822993 2826580 in me, you're better<br />than I wanna be.
2828915 2832209 Don't think,<br />'cause I understand...
2832210 2833627 Don't think,<br />'cause I understand...
2833628 2835462 I care...
2835463 2838007 Don't think,<br />'cause I'm talking...
2838008 2840759 Oh, I can't do this.
2840760 2842052 She's so great.
2842053 2843512 I can't believe this.
2843513 2846099 I can't believe<br />this is happening.
2846892 2849894 I'm open...
2849895 2852898 to falling from grace.
2872834 2874085 Hi.
2893021 2895815 "Must fly. Have better offer."
2896608 2899109 Greedy westerner.<br />Wants more money.
2899110 2900402 Who cares?
2900403 2903448 Can't spend hard currency<br />in hell.
2905575 2907326 Send this message...
2907327 2910705 "Fly, don't buzz off.
2912123 2914292 "I'll double your fee...
2915669 2920090 "or send my own boys<br />to take care of the woman."
2927764 2929766 You OK?
2931643 2936565 Let's...<br />let's just lie here.
2938733 2941444 Can't we just<br />be like this tonight?
2943363 2945490 Is that what you want?
2946199 2948034 It's so magic.
2954082 2955917 It just feels so perfect.
2986865 2989534 It's 7:00 a.m.,<br />and here are the news headlines.
2998627 3000086 Thomas?
3076788 3079415 Lev Naumovitch,<br />it's here! Good man!
3079416 3080958 It's revolutionary, sir!
3080959 3084044 She's boldly cast aside<br />a slew of stale ideas...
3084045 3086630 but I think the formula<br />is incomplete.
3086631 3087798 It will take months...
3087799 3089091 That won't do...
3089092 3092136 because now that the people are<br />nicely beginning to freeze...
3092137 3095890 Tretiak must sweep in<br />with a miracle to save them.
3095891 3098267 How high do you want it,<br />Mr. Tretiak?
3098268 3100769 To the top.<br />Good morning, Yuri.
3100770 3102104 Good morning.
3102105 3105191 Perhaps I<br />can confirm the validity...
3105192 3107943 of this formula more quickly<br />if I dispense...
3107944 3110946 with certain protocols.<br />But, Mr. Tretiak...
3110947 3113157 How long, Dr. Botvin,<br />since you received...
3113158 3117036 your last salary check<br />from Moscow University?
3117037 3120040 Ukrainian Independence Day.
3121708 3122876 Last August.
3125420 3127756 Ivan, he's on-line.
3129841 3130967 Do it.
3134346 3135555 To spider...
3137933 3139558 You've got the recipe.
3139559 3140851 "Where's my dough?"
3140852 3142979 To human fly...
3144272 3147608 Recipe incomplete.
3147609 3149652 The cake won't rise.
3149653 3152697 Hence, no dough.
3159120 3161455 I am not the baker...
3161456 3164125 "...but don't make me<br />the butcher."
3166419 3168213 I like this guy.
3172384 3175427 No play, no pay.
3175428 3179099 I'm certain you kept<br />the cookbook.
3187732 3188859 Holland Park.
3204457 3206208 I'll check that for you.
3206209 3209379 Yes, that seems to be fine.<br />One moment. Aah!
3218680 3220390 He's keeping me on-line.
3230233 3231526 You wait here.
3274861 3277614 You, beside the car.
3278740 3282576 Now, turn around.<br />Step away from the vehicle.
3282577 3283787 He's armed!
3307269 3308436 Drive!
3318071 3320532 Go the other way. Go!
3325453 3327853 ♪ You're all I've got tonight. ♪
3329207 3331807 ♪ You're all I've got tonight. ♪
3334045 3335380 What about him?
3344055 3345640 What about this one?
3350353 3352730 Yeah. That...
3352731 3356067 You see. We believe<br />they're all the same villain.
3360864 3362324 Oh, my God.
3364367 3366577 They're all him?
3366578 3368329 We believe so.
3368330 3371333 He eluded a hit squad<br />this morning in Holland Park.
3373627 3376128 Then he fled the U.K.<br />out of Heathrow.
3376129 3377963 We've got a handful<br />of false identities...
3377964 3381510 used on visas,<br />passports, leases...
3382761 3384053 Nicholas Owen...
3384054 3386263 Louie Guanella...
3386264 3387516 Peter Damian...
3388975 3391227 Charles Borroneo.
3391228 3393812 Of course.
3393813 3396649 Thomas More.
3396650 3398777 All names of Catholic saints.
3402280 3404782 Can you access<br />Heathrow's passenger lists...
3404783 3407911 for the last eight hours?
3408537 3410204 I think it might be possible.
3410205 3411414 Good.
3419589 3420757 Go!
3439317 3440443 Yeah!
3452205 3453373 Yes!
3465177 3466678 See, my friends...
3467429 3470515 you back the biggest rats.
3491703 3492871 Hello.
3496917 3498459 Out, out.
3498460 3501003 Freeloaders, out.
3501004 3502671 I want to drink alone.
3502672 3504007 Close the curtain.
3526530 3528323 - What?<br />- What?
3530825 3532868 Don't look down.
3532869 3534829 You know who I am?
3536039 3537206 No.
3537207 3541001 I'm the thief<br />you tried to cheat.
3541002 3544005 This is your accountant.
3546341 3547843 Talk to him.
3550595 3553139 The phone goes<br />the other way, you moron.
3556810 3558435 Hello.
3558436 3560146 Tretiak speaking.
3561022 3565609 That money to Zurich,<br />send it now.
3565610 3567195 I said now.
3568697 3569990 Yeah.
3572617 3573785 Thank you.
3574828 3578706 You know what the hardest part<br />about being you is?
3578707 3581376 Pretending to be so bad in bed.
3583336 3585630 You son of the bitch.
3586381 3588841 There is an impostor.<br />Get him out.
3588842 3591468 Hey, hey, hey!
3591469 3595222 Take your hands off me,<br />you idiots!
3595223 3597641 Are you crazy? It's me.
3597642 3598851 Go, go!
3598852 3600269 Catch him, go!
3600270 3602230 Ilya, get the bastard!
3625086 3627464 Fifty million. I'm out.
3630050 3632051 Mr. Ferrer checking out.
3632052 3634721 OK.
3644606 3647108 I'll have one, too.
3647734 3648859 Emma.
3648860 3650820 Hi.
3651821 3654533 I'm... I'm overwhelmed.
3656368 3657493 You found me.
3657494 3659204 Wasn't very hard.
3660497 3664250 Two men with saint's names<br />flew into Moscow yesterday.
3664251 3668379 Isadore Bakanja<br />is a short, bald African...
3668380 3670923 whereas Vincent Ferrer...
3670924 3673092 Named after a saint<br />who betrayed his best friend.
3673093 3675095 How could you do it?
3675595 3677555 Emma...
3677556 3680308 I... I had to.
3681685 3682935 I'm a thief.
3682936 3684979 I want my cards back.
3684980 3687022 You flew all this way<br />for your cards?
3687023 3688190 Yes, I did.
3688191 3690902 No.<br />It's because you're in love.
3694698 3695990 I rest my case.
3695991 3697867 Who are you?
3697868 3701078 No one has a clue,<br />least of all me.
3701079 3704915 And why would you<br />steal cold fusion?
3704916 3708295 It's free.<br />Why would you do that?
3710422 3712173 Eight million reasons.
3712174 3714926 Eight million.<br />Wow. That's all?
3716678 3720181 I would have<br />given them to you...
3720182 3722100 if you'd only asked.
3728523 3729899 You've got<br />to get away from me.
3729900 3733402 I'm not going until you tell me<br />why you lied to me.
3733403 3736030 - You lied to me.<br />- I lied to you?
3736031 3738616 You almost got me killed.<br />The guy says it doesn't work.
3738617 3740451 Well, screw him.
3740452 3742786 I don't think you'd enjoy that.
3742787 3744789 You're right.<br />I don't think I would.
3752464 3755592 Emma, you don't know<br />what you're dealing with here.
3757260 3758720 What?
3767479 3769188 - They took my pills.<br />- No, they didn't.
3769189 3771315 I palmed them from your purse.
3771316 3773567 I need one or two.
3773568 3776768 I need...<br />I have a bad heart.
3776780 3779780 - I know.<br />- It's starting to pound.
3779816 3781916 It's OK. I've got your pills.
3781959 3785159 OK, I've got two in my hand.
3785163 3786413 I'm gonna pass out.
3786414 3788333 Sit down on the floor.
3789960 3793170 Just get down on the floor.<br />That's right.
3793171 3795047 That's right.<br />Eat two out of my hand.
3795048 3798634 That's right. OK?
3798635 3801137 While you're down there...
3803890 3805851 Get the pocketknife<br />out of my boot.
3808520 3812356 This formula makes<br />certain assumptions...
3812357 3816777 which contradict all we know<br />about cold fusion cathodes...
3816778 3819071 so testing at any level<br />becomes futile...
3819072 3822825 without further information,<br />Mr. Tretiak.
3822826 3825661 Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.
3825662 3827163 Help is here.
3838800 3840594 The two came very quietly.
3842971 3844181 Oh.
3849436 3852230 And they left even more quietly.
3853982 3855400 Close the city.
3855859 3860655 Kill him, and bring her... alive.
3874878 3877755 Why are they after me?
3877756 3882092 Tretiak, the guy I work for...<br />he owns this city, cops and all.
3882093 3886430 We have to convince him there's<br />nothing more he wants from you.
3886431 3888558 What do you want from me?
3894689 3898234 - Everything's on those cards?<br />- Yes.
3898235 3899777 So the formula works?
3899778 3902405 Oh, kiss me again.
3904783 3906283 - No.<br />- Make up your mind.
3906284 3911539 Oh, it's... I have to<br />figure out the order...
3911540 3914375 before the formula works,<br />and I'm not giving it to him.
3914376 3916502 - Tretiak will find you.<br />- No.
3916503 3919046 He found me,<br />and that's hard to do.
3919047 3923217 - I found you.<br />- Yes, you did.
3923218 3924594 What do you need?
3929182 3931141 I need some time...
3931142 3932477 and I need...
3934813 3937773 I need a place to work...
3937774 3939442 and...
3940485 3942736 Where's everyone going?
3942737 3946156 To their country<br />relatives to cut firewood.
3946157 3947909 There's no heat in the city.
3958128 3960254 How long will it take you<br />to finish the formula?
3960255 3961922 I don't know.
3961923 3965176 Two hours, maybe.<br />I don't know.
3965177 3967887 Should be enough time to get<br />our passports together...
3967888 3970890 and for us to get married.
3970891 3973643 - We're getting married?<br />- Yes.
3974811 3978106 I want you to be<br />Mrs. Martin de Porres.
3981943 3984446 - You're not Martin.<br />- No.
3985947 3987157 Who are you?
3990660 3992120 I don't have a name.
3993747 3994997 That's sad.
3994998 3997416 Will you have a name<br />when we get home?
3997417 3999376 I don't have a home.
3999377 4001170 When we get back...
4001171 4003506 you do the science,<br />I'll do the math.
4003507 4005300 We'll market your formula<br />around the world.
4005884 4008595 We'll make a fortune,<br />and then...
4010305 4011515 we'll see.
4012933 4013683 OK?
4023235 4024569 Emma!
4042587 4044214 No trouble, OK?
4047759 4051096 If you want to live,<br />never leave my side.
4099227 4100437 Ohh!
4171925 4173300 ♪ Spice room, sun room... ♪
4173301 4175470 ♪ Shadow room, night... ♪
4176930 4178723 I've got you.
4185230 4186815 Come on.
4191152 4193071 Here we go. Up.
4196575 4199244 We've gotta get you warm.
4207252 4209087 We're almost there.
4233195 4234495 Come on.
4235780 4237580 Come on.
4243121 4246290 You'll wait till Christ<br />comes to Moscow.
4246291 4249043 Elevator was made of mahogany.
4249044 4251253 Tenants used it<br />for firewood last winter.
4251254 4252880 We need your help.
4252881 4255716 He fell in the river,<br />and he's freezing.
4255717 4257468 - Need clothes.<br />- We're just people...
4257469 4261972 You're not people.<br />You're Americans.
4261973 4265268 Yes, but we ran into trouble<br />with your Mafia.
4297424 4302013 She disapproves of what I do,<br />but eats the bread it buys her.
4304015 4306225 No heat for sale...
4306226 4308186 but these clothes<br />will make him warm.
4313650 4316276 I tell her, Mashenka,<br />go back to bed.
4316277 4318404 She's always puttering around.
4322200 4326203 It's here.<br />Built to escape Secret Police.
4326204 4327746 In you go.
4342429 4344847 You've got hypothermia.
4344848 4347392 We have to get<br />these wet clothes off...
4348810 4350353 keep you warm.
4350812 4353063 They must be in<br />one of these buildings.
4353064 4354773 Check every apartment.
4356735 4359904 How you doing?<br />Talk to me.
4359905 4362782 Snug as a bug in a rug.
4370832 4374293 OK. We're gonna...
4374294 4378380 We're gonna have to do this<br />before your body temperature...
4378381 4381384 falls below 95 degrees.
4394189 4397150 Two kids<br />talking about foreigners.
4406034 4407786 Listen to me, tenants!
4408662 4410913 Show me where<br />the Americans are...
4410914 4414959 and you'll be paid<br />in American dollars.
4414960 4417378 Five hundred bucks reward.
4417379 4418630 Daddy...
4420215 4423425 have you seen, by chance,<br />two Americans?
4423426 4426263 Just one American<br />and one polar bear.
4428139 4430058 Do we get 250?
4449828 4450996 We check upstairs.
4463425 4464926 What's your name?
4468346 4469806 Who are you really?
4471850 4473017 Simon.
4473018 4474311 Simon?
4475270 4478355 So you are named for a saint.
4478356 4480233 No, Simon the magician.
4481151 4483277 I did tricks...
4483278 4486906 tricks for Agnes...<br />and that's how I got things.
4486907 4490951 Priests took everything,<br />took Agnes.
4490952 4493078 Dogs too big.
4493079 4496207 Teeth. Teeth.
4496208 4498042 She fell.
4498043 4499461 I escaped.
4500921 4502506 I always escape.
4503465 4505967 I don't believe in magic<br />anymore.
4507636 4508970 I do.
4511640 4514351 I've never felt<br />like this before.
4515560 4516728 How?
4518146 4519689 I'm freezing.
4524319 4526071 These are here!
4533203 4536121 We gotta get out of here.<br />Are you OK?
4536122 4538333 They're coming.
4539334 4542044 Americans are here!
4542045 4544506 Hurry. Here, put this on.
4550345 4551513 Ilya!
4565151 4566444 Upstairs. Go!
4584504 4586089 Maybe we can jump.
4587215 4588758 Let's jump.
4592888 4594723 Come on.
4620415 4621625 Wait.
4638934 4640894 We need her alive, idiot.
4643063 4644773 Embassy's east of here.
4664125 4666002 You're late.<br />Where have you been?
4666795 4668504 I've been waiting two hours.
4668505 4672216 Come on. I've got some beautiful<br />paintings for you to buy.
4672217 4673802 In here. Come on. Come on.
4678807 4682101 Don't fret.<br />It's just my curator, Toli.
4682102 4684854 I am Alexa Frankievitch,<br />but being you're Americans...
4684855 4686772 you can call me Frankie.
4686773 4688899 OK, Frankie.<br />I've got money. We want...
4688900 4692945 I know.<br />The icon of the Virgin of the Damned.
4692946 4695447 - Are those maps of the tunnels?<br />- Yes.
4695448 4698284 We're not here to buy art.<br />Take us to the American Embassy.
4698285 4701412 Right.<br />I need $10,000 up-front.
4701413 4703831 No.
4703832 4707376 OK. 7,000 and not a penny less.
4707377 4708879 Shh.
4716469 4717970 Police.
4717971 4720056 No. Tretiak's goons.
4729191 4730399 Wait.
4730400 4733444 Sasha,<br />go east to the embassy.
4733445 4735487 - Are we lost?<br />- What's wrong?
4735488 4738866 You're in Russia, sir.<br />Everything is complicated.
4738867 4739992 But you know the way?
4739993 4743705 Like the face<br />of a Bulgari chronograph.
4754007 4755926 I remember. This way.
4760305 4763058 At last. Water main.
4763850 4766143 They shut it down<br />each afternoon in winter.
4766144 4767811 What time do they<br />turn it back on?
4767812 4771273 You have five minutes,<br />plus or minus.
4771274 4772441 Plus or minus?
4772442 4774944 That means several<br />minutes earlier or later.
4774945 4778114 Don't worry.<br />Third opening is your embassy.
4796299 4798218 Quick. Someone's coming.
4804015 4806601 Come on. Come on.
4814401 4816443 Here's the second one.
4816444 4818280 Embassy's next.
4821992 4825662 - About two more minutes.<br />- Yeah. Unless it's minus.
4829499 4832210 Damn.<br />It's sealed.
4833753 4835546 We'll have to go back.
4835547 4836798 Come on.
4860780 4862032 Hurry.
4872125 4874169 Up you go.
4893730 4896775 Yankee, go home!<br />Down with Yankee!
4904616 4907910 Embassy's only<br />about 100 yards away.
4907911 4911540 There's a car right above us.<br />Watch your head.
4944906 4946907 I'll create a diversion.
4946908 4949743 It should take you 10 seconds<br />to run to those gates.
4949744 4951746 They'll open them<br />when they see you coming.
4952664 4954415 OK. I can do that.
4954416 4956584 You can do it.
4956585 4960629 Wait. When am I gonna see you?
4960630 4962673 I'll find you. You found me.
4962674 4964384 Yeah, I did.
4994706 4995874 Aah!
5027239 5030741 I'm an American!<br />Open the gate!
5030742 5033328 Open the gate!<br />I'm an American!
5034037 5036247 Back off from the gate.
5036248 5039251 Back off. I said back off.
5040377 5043797 Stand back from the gate.
5045507 5047008 I said back off!
5060021 5061522 She outran you?
5061523 5063608 How humiliating.
5067487 5070740 One... shot left.
5072409 5074451 Can't come<br />all the way to Russia...
5074452 5077288 and not play Russian roulette.
5077289 5079583 Before you shoot me,<br />want to know where the money is?
5081251 5082960 Whose money?
5082961 5084628 Tretiak's, yours.
5084629 5087131 He treats you like dirt.<br />You could have it all.
5087132 5088716 What are you saying?
5088717 5090968 I'm saying your father<br />stashed billions...
5090969 5094013 and I know where it's hidden.<br />Let's make a deal.
5094014 5097726 So... where are all those<br />hidden billions?
5098476 5102397 I know... but I don't think<br />I'm gonna tell you.
5132219 5135095 Joseph, what's the holdup?<br />I said get 'em inside!
5135096 5137097 You're worse<br />than all the others.
5137098 5139850 However, burns will heal.
5139851 5142561 Maybe a little chance<br />of scarring, perhaps...
5142562 5145981 but all in all,<br />I'd say he's a very lucky boy.
5145982 5148360 Lucky? Look at me.
5149277 5151946 I am a damn devil.
5151947 5153532 Christ.
5156826 5157952 Yes?
5157953 5161121 I have run every test<br />on this cold fusion formula...
5161122 5165709 and must conclude<br />it is not merely incomplete...
5165710 5168045 but rather...<br />impossible.
5168046 5171883 You may as well try to create<br />perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.
5172843 5175679 I invest millions...
5176888 5179850 and you can't make it work!
5183270 5186189 What are you doing<br />with my money?
5188859 5192695 Do you think it comes so easy?
5192696 5193904 No!
5193905 5195990 But, sir...
5195991 5200703 I have been working for<br />nearly two weeks without sleep.
5200704 5205332 At first blush, the theorem<br />appears quite impressive, convincing.
5205333 5206918 It does?
5211381 5212941 Yes. It does.
5216428 5217761 Good man.
5217762 5220473 We can use it<br />to destroy our enemies.
5222267 5225769 Only Dr. Russell<br />can spoil my plan.
5225770 5228606 If she gets back to London<br />and speaks to the press...
5228607 5232484 From here to the airport<br />are three army checkpoints...
5232485 5234403 all of them loyal to us.
5234404 5236530 Make certain<br />they get the message...
5236531 5239451 She doesn't leave Moscow alive.
5241995 5243245 Mr. President.
5243246 5246415 As former Vice-minister<br />of Energy and Power...
5246416 5251754 I hear all manner of schemes<br />that provide cheaper energy.
5251755 5255382 And as our countrymen<br />freeze to death...
5255383 5258886 I've become aware of<br />a marvelous new technology...
5258887 5261889 about which I'm hopelessly<br />out of my league...
5261890 5264683 from a scientific viewpoint.
5264684 5267978 That's why I brought<br />our eminent physicist here...
5267979 5271273 Dr. Lev Botvin from<br />the University of Moscow.
5271274 5273901 Before we are dazzled<br />by the good news...
5273902 5276612 let's dispense with the bad.
5276613 5278864 What is the price<br />of this marvel?
5278865 5281742 The cost of research<br />and development are there...
5281743 5285497 which is all<br />you are asked to defray.
5290585 5293337 Ten billion in hard currency?
5293338 5298510 I can't even pay my teachers,<br />my miners, my doctors.
5306017 5308018 Where are you heading?
5308019 5311481 I thought we'd drink<br />some vodka to get warmer.
5315694 5318779 Like the miracle of socialism...
5318780 5322157 our miracle<br />of cold fusion failed.
5322158 5323367 But no matter.
5323368 5327705 We have sold cold fusion<br />to President Karpov.
5327706 5331292 We will use the scandal<br />of its failure to destroy him.
5331293 5334211 The army must be mobilized<br />by midnight tomorrow.
5334212 5337882 You're a man in a hurry.<br />That's only one day.
5337883 5341343 Not now, old witch.<br />We're working.
5341344 5342845 Yes. Think of it.
5342846 5348726 One day, you can be proud again<br />to be a Russian general...
5348727 5352897 with a big nuclear missile<br />where your prick used to be.
5352898 5356066 You must complete a form<br />before you get on a flight home.
5356067 5357735 Any medical problems?
5357736 5359278 I have a heart condition.
5359279 5361865 Do you need me to arrange<br />any medication for you?
5362782 5365327 Well, I haven't<br />needed a pill.
5365869 5367077 That's strange.
5367078 5369246 Get a form from<br />table three down the corridor.
5369247 5370789 I'll be back in 10 minutes...
5370790 5373042 by your side,<br />all the way to the airport.
5373043 5374251 Thank you.
5374252 5376545 ...Across the street<br />in central Moscow...
5376546 5381217 where a mob attacked several<br />companies with ties to America.
5381218 5385221 Apparently, four U.S. citizens<br />were injured in the attack.
5385222 5387139 I'm told<br />that all American citizens...
5387140 5389808 have been asked to report<br />to the American embassy...
5389809 5391769 for immediate evacuation.
5391770 5395105 Excuse me. little lady. You look lost.
5395106 5397650 - No, I'm fine.<br />- May I help you?
5397651 5402404 Allow me to introduce myself.<br />My name is August Christopher.
5402405 5406033 Named after Saint Augustine,<br />who coined my favorite phrase...
5406034 5408619 "Give me chastity<br />and give me constancy...
5408620 5411289 "but do not give it yet."
5415377 5418963 Simon, I'm on the next flight<br />out of here.
5418964 5420214 Are you coming with me?
5420215 5423760 No. But they are.
5429933 5433561 I'll need you to develop<br />a sudden fear of flying.
5433562 5435480 Find a quiet room.
5436356 5438691 Finish the formula<br />and fax it back to me.
5438692 5440484 My number's on the back.
5440485 5444321 I don't understand.<br />Why are you keeping my cards?
5444322 5446198 I've got to deal<br />with the Russians...
5446199 5448325 or you'll never be safe.
5448326 5450119 Be good at school.
5450120 5451329 Wait.
5453790 5456835 - Don't you trust me, darlin'?<br />- Trust who?
5457711 5459461 That hurts, Emma.
5459462 5462173 I'm serious.<br />What's your name?
5462174 5465009 My name is August Christopher.
5465010 5468053 Of course I trust you,<br />August Christopher.
5468054 5470097 I mean, Vincent Ferrer...
5470098 5472350 I mean, Martin de Porres...
5473602 5475437 Thomas More.
5476605 5479566 After all,<br />you are my personal saint.
5480525 5482443 You have to be a very good...
5482444 5486030 and, usually, a very dead person<br />to become a saint.
5486031 5489700 And more importantly,<br />you have to work three miracles.
5489701 5492037 Now, get to work.
5492829 5494496 Who's that man?
5494497 5496916 You're leaving<br />on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?
5496917 5499960 Probably be your<br />last chance out of here.
5499961 5501505 Better hurry. It's leaving.
5503882 5506509 Your troops<br />will depose the president...
5506510 5509512 and install Ivan Tretiak<br />as leader of Russia.
5509513 5514308 Moscow must be<br />ringed with tanks by early evening.
5514309 5517686 Don't worry.<br />The people will follow me.
5517687 5519980 They will be crying<br />for revolution.
5519981 5522608 Still, no one's<br />guessed the simple truth...
5522609 5524736 of where the heating oil went.
5528949 5531742 Who would believe<br />that a sea of oil...
5531743 5534454 was hidden under<br />this very building?
5536122 5539124 Yuri, I understand<br />your Nataly is to...
5539125 5541752 Francis, you devil...
5541753 5544129 I heard you came down here,<br />and you didn't call me.
5544130 5547550 - Hello, Dominic...<br />- Give me a ring, when you get this, Charles.
5547551 5550302 Lou,<br />I've heard on the grapevine...
5550303 5553682 you're brokering a revolutionary<br />new energy source.
5554558 5556851 If it's as good<br />as it's cracked up to be...
5556852 5560145 I have friends who can double<br />your best offer...
5560146 5562356 on deposit in Zurich...
5562357 5565277 within one hour<br />of delivery and confirmation.
5566111 5567279 I'll be waiting.
5588592 5590384 The work could be here.
5590385 5592345 This machine could work,<br />couldn't it?
5595098 5596807 Who are you?
5596808 5598976 A friend of Dr. Russell's.
5598977 5600228 Dr. Russell?
5602397 5604481 What's this equation?
5604482 5605901 It's so simple.
5607360 5609528 This is the key<br />to Dr. Russell's formula.
5609529 5610906 Yes.
5612699 5614992 The alarm. You had better go.
5614993 5619080 I need a miracle.<br />You've got 12 hours.
5620624 5622791 But Mr. Tretiak's rally<br />is tonight.
5622792 5624503 Can you make it work?
5626171 5627339 Make it work.
5631885 5633344 What is wrong here?
5633345 5634804 Uh, the alarm...
5637516 5639434 Uh... uh...
5640185 5641645 I tripped.
5650487 5654031 You are Nikolai Petrovich.
5654032 5655783 You are Nikolai Provovich...
5655784 5657035 Petrovich.
5668129 5670173 Tunnel built by KGB...
5672425 5674802 Leads to machine room<br />in Kremlin.
5674803 5679056 Do you know where<br />the president's quarters are?
5679057 5683060 President Karpov is there.
5683061 5687273 But there are many guards,<br />so I suggest...
5687274 5689316 An alternate route?
5689317 5692279 Money.<br />Now.
5694239 5695824 Oh, ye of little faith.
5698535 5701245 Russia stands tonight...
5701246 5704123 on the brink<br />of a second revolution.
5704124 5706709 As the number of deaths<br />from freezing mounts...
5706710 5708711 hundreds of thousands<br />of protesters...
5708712 5710921 have taken to the streets.
5710922 5712590 Even as<br />Russian President Karpov...
5712591 5714884 is promising<br />a mysterious solution...
5714885 5716844 to the crippling<br />heating-oil shortage...
5716845 5719096 troops opposed<br />to the elected government...
5719097 5721473 and led<br />by General Leo Sklarov...
5721474 5724268 have begun to ring<br />the Russian capital city.
5724269 5726270 Angry, frightened citizens...
5726271 5729106 are gathering outside<br />the Kremlin in Red Square...
5729107 5730983 but they're not braving<br />the bitter cold...
5730984 5733110 for yet another political rally.
5733111 5736614 They've been drawn here by<br />the promise of a revelation...
5736615 5738073 whatever that may be...
5738074 5740618 in what's become<br />a life-and-death struggle...
5740619 5743663 for the future<br />of democracy in Russia.
5819072 5821907 Mr. President?<br />I'm your friend.
5821908 5823743 What do you want?
5825620 5828914 I want to help you<br />to destroy Tretiak.
5828915 5830750 I need you to listen<br />for about 30 seconds.
5832586 5835379 I'm all right. Stay outside.
5835380 5837423 Please, continue.
5837424 5840926 Tonight you'll stand trial<br />in Red Square before the world.
5840927 5844305 Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,<br />I need you to admit to it.
5844306 5846307 Agree with this criminal?
5846308 5848810 If you want<br />to destroy Tretiak... yes.
5865994 5868204 Gruschev,<br />take Mr. Karpov downstairs.
5868205 5869456 The wife stays here.
5871625 5875085 Get your hands off!<br />What you are doing is illegal!
5875086 5877087 The people won't stand for it!
5877088 5880592 The people are too cold<br />to stop it. Who are you?
5894856 5897651 Tretiak!<br />Tretiak! Tretiak!
5913041 5915167 Friends...
5915168 5917127 countrymen...
5917128 5919339 Russians!
5929015 5933352 You heard about this morning's<br />sensational events.
5933353 5936522 Many shocking documents<br />were recovered...
5936523 5938816 from the president's<br />secret files...
5938817 5941527 locked within his private safe.
5941528 5946490 The documents which will be<br />published in today's papers...
5946491 5950870 prove that the traitor Karpov...
5950871 5954748 was about to steal<br />over 40 trillion...
5954749 5957668 of our precious<br />Russian rubles...
5957669 5962381 in a reckless scheme<br />to save his hide!
5962382 5964383 To add insult...
5964384 5967386 millions of dollars<br />were to be paid...
5967387 5970515 to this international criminal!
5977480 5979523 And for what<br />was your president...
5979524 5983736 hoping to bankrupt<br />our national treasury?
5983737 5989074 What you see is a fairy tale<br />called cold fusion.
5989075 5994038 You pass electric current<br />into the machine...
5994039 5998334 and there is supposed<br />to be a chemical reaction.
5998335 5999960 Watch.
5999961 6003631 It can't even light up<br />a tiny light bulb!
6003632 6006133 Do you dare deny this,<br />Mr. Karpov?
6006134 6008385 Absolutely not!
6008386 6010763 I proudly admit it!
6010764 6013891 But enough puny failure.
6013892 6016060 Failure's in the past!
6016061 6019355 Begging is behind us!
6019356 6024194 The balance of power<br />is about to shift!
6057102 6059145 Miracle one.
6063525 6066277 Karpov! Karpov!
6066278 6068237 Karpov! Karpov!
6068238 6070531 Karpov! Karpov!
6070532 6072741 Karpov! Karpov!
6072742 6074994 Karpov! Karpov!
6074995 6077788 Karpov! Karpov!
6077789 6079707 Karpov! Karpov!
6079708 6082168 Karpov! Karpov!
6082169 6084212 Karpov! Karpov!
6091511 6092636 Ilya! Ilya!
6092637 6094054 Go! Go!
6094055 6095640 Go, go, go!
6097184 6101645 I order all troops<br />loyal to mother Russia...
6101646 6105150 to seize the criminal Tretiak!
6110697 6112323 A thousand apologies,<br />Mr. President.
6112324 6115744 There was a miscommunication<br />somewhere in the chain of command.
6122209 6123626 Miracle two.
6123627 6126921 The billionaire<br />industrialist and his son, Ilya,...
6126922 6129507 were taken to the infamous<br />Lubyanka prison...
6129508 6133886 where they await trial<br />along with General Leo Sklarov.
6133887 6137681 Moscow woke today to the<br />forgotten sensation of warmth...
6137682 6139975 as millions of gallons<br />of heating oil...
6139976 6143729 flowed from a storage depot discovered<br />beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.
6143730 6146399 He made no threat<br />to contact you in the future?
6147275 6148692 He never had the chance.
6148693 6150237 You'll tell us<br />if he does make contact?
6150487 6153073 - Oh, yes.<br />- Which he may well do.
6153615 6155616 He's a proper rogue, you see.
6155617 6159245 He charms women,<br />this so-called Saint.
6159246 6162206 It seems it's his stock<br />in trade. No offense.
6162207 6166085 Well, I am offended.<br />All I got from this Saint...
6166086 6168546 was a series<br />of near-death experiences.
6168547 6170464 Count yourself lucky.
6170465 6174093 Look, I have a very important<br />conference I must prepare for.
6174094 6176470 We understand.<br />You have a life.
6176471 6178222 We appreciate<br />your taking the time.
6178223 6179766 No problem.
6186273 6188275 She's in love with him.
6258720 6261555 I wanted to call you<br />and tell you everything.
6261556 6262806 It hasn't been safe.
6262807 6265477 I couldn't stop<br />thinking about you.
6267729 6272775 So... have you been busy?
6272776 6275069 Yeah.<br />I've been working real hard.
6275070 6277905 Thank God I have my cards back.
6277906 6281534 You don't believe in<br />this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?
6281535 6284245 You know,<br />you're a very pretty lady.
6284246 6286580 Oh, my God.
6286581 6288083 That was you?
6289084 6291545 That's who I thought<br />Dr. Russell would like.
6292629 6295214 I thought you were<br />some old biddy...
6295215 6298634 not some gorgeous<br />soon-to-be-trillionaire.
6298635 6301595 You know you're going to be<br />the richest woman in the world.
6301596 6302763 I am?
6302764 6305725 Why do you think<br />I'm hanging around?
6312190 6313315 - Emma.<br />- Yeah?
6313316 6315110 My life is very strange.
6316069 6317404 I just...
6321366 6323534 I don't do anything normal.
6323535 6325119 I'm... I can't even...
6325120 6328623 I know. I know you.
6329833 6332251 I know your life.
6332252 6334920 - What do you want?<br />- I want you.
6334921 6337006 For how long?
6337007 6339050 It doesn't matter.
6345974 6347684 Tell me you love me.
6349603 6351271 I... I love you.
6352355 6353523 Simon.
6354983 6357194 I love you, Simon.
6358445 6360488 Miracle three.
6384012 6386013 Dear Simon...
6386014 6389433 the pin is something I've kept for years.<br />God knows why.
6389434 6392895 A graduation gift<br />from Catholic school.
6392896 6395481 But don't worry.<br />You don't have to wear it.
6395482 6397983 I just wanted you<br />to have something of mine...
6397984 6400152 something I loved.
6400153 6403072 Simon, if sainthood<br />requires three miracles...
6403073 6405866 then I'd say you've made it,<br />my love...
6405867 6408077 and so I hope you'll understand.
6408078 6411705 Last night, it became clear<br />what I have to do this morning.
6411706 6415084 I'm going to give<br />cold fusion to the world.
6415085 6418003 It's the only way,<br />if we're ever together again...
6418004 6421882 that I'll know it's for you,<br />and you'll know it's for me.
6421883 6427054 If cold fusion is free,<br />then you and I, Simon, will be free, too.
6427055 6430349 Listen. If you think giving away<br />everything before the world...
6430350 6432726 preventing us from making<br />an unimaginable fortune...
6432727 6434896 will accomplish anything...
6436106 6437816 you're absolutely right.
6439401 6441360 Simon, what are you doing here?
6441361 6443863 There are police.
6443864 6445364 They're everywhere.
6445365 6447741 I wouldn't miss it<br />for the world.
6447742 6450829 - You wore the pin.<br />- Of course.
6454791 6455959 You better go.
6469890 6471224 How will I find you?
6473226 6476104 I'll find you. You found me.
6503256 6506342 Although our next speaker<br />requires no introduction...
6506343 6510930 after last week's<br />Moscow fireworks...
6510931 6515392 please let me welcome<br />Dr. E.J. Russell.
6515393 6519313 Excuse me.<br />Is this seat taken?
6519314 6520064 No.
6522400 6524194 Dr. Russell?
6533245 6536163 You don't believe in all this<br />cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?
6536164 6537831 Thank you. Good morning.
6537832 6539375 No.
6539376 6543629 We all know cold fusion<br />has had a...
6543630 6546632 a difficult childhood.
6546633 6549301 Those of us in the field<br />are orphans...
6549302 6551303 bastards, at best.
6551304 6556476 But difficult childhoods, I believe,<br />make the most interesting adults.
6557978 6561564 I know most of you thought<br />that cold fusion...
6561565 6563015 I'm her biggest fan.
6563024 6566224 I think she's a fox.<br />Look at that.
6566300 6568600 Even though some of you may feel...
6568647 6572547 that its practical application<br />is still somewhat speculative...
6572742 6577037 I've come here today to share<br />how that dream is slowly...
6577038 6578831 becoming a reality.
6578832 6581750 Yes, it may take years<br />to finally learn...
6581751 6583752 Look at the time.<br />Got to go.
6583753 6587423 ...stabilize its power,<br />but with your help...
6587424 6590468 we can all work towards<br />making the... the...
6591636 6596099 dream of cold fusion<br />finally come true.
6620290 6621415 Quickly!
6621416 6623292 We got him!
6623293 6625253 Hyah!
6626963 6628756 Hands behind your back!
6628757 6630883 Got you, you slippery...
