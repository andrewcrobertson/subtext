1664080 1667030 announced in 1989...
1667035 1670056 that they had discovered<br />cold fusion...
1670060 1674090 a revolutionary process<br />of generating energy...
1674094 1678044 they were at first<br />acclaimed as geniuses...
1678048 1681032 and then condemned<br />as charlatans.
1682053 1685053 The protocols of cold fusion...
1685057 1686099 SIMON: What are those? Drugs?
1687003 1690016 Could I have one?<br />My head's pounding.
1690020 1692033 She's boring the life<br />out of me.
1694017 1696025 -They're for my heart.<br />-Oh.
1697042 1700071 You have very pretty eyes.<br />You're a pretty lady.
1700076 1703022 -Who are you?<br />-Me?
1703022 1705076 I'm here to do an interview<br />with that Dr. Russell.
1705080 1708051 I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.
1708056 1711052 You don't put any stock in<br />this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?
1711056 1713069 -Actually, I do.<br />-Really?
1713073 1716094 WOMAN: Dr. Emma Russell.
1723032 1725032 Oops.
1729087 1735050 EMMA: Well, I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1735054 1737050 I'm actually more interested...
1737055 1741005 in what questions you all have<br />about cold fusion...
1741009 1743022 so I thought we would<br />start with those.
1743026 1745035 Any questions?
1747064 1748077 Please?
1748081 1750031 MAN: I have, Dr. Russell.
1751035 1754056 Can you explain<br />the actual process of fusion...
1754060 1756023 you know, the theory?
1756027 1759011 Yes. Oh, there it is.
1759015 1763016 This is the--the apparatus.
1763020 1764057 And very simply...
1764062 1767087 when positively charged<br />deuterons...
1767091 1770087 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode...
1770091 1772037 they cram together...
1772042 1775096 and there are millions of them<br />inside the cathode...
1776000 1779038 getting closer and closer,<br />and then they fuse...
1779042 1781059 and they create energy<br />in the form of helium.
1781063 1783022 WOMAN: But I read somewhere...
1783026 1785001 that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated...
1785005 1788085 so how do we know it works?
1788089 1791006 EMMA: We don't.
1791010 1792027 Not yet.
1793040 1795027 But if you remember Einstein...
1795031 1798044 he knew the theory<br />of relativity to be true...
1798048 1800032 long before he could prove it.
1800032 1802015 I mean, he felt the truth.
1802057 1805074 And, uh, some of us<br />feel the same way...
1805078 1806099 about cold fusion...
1807004 1809050 because it's there.<br />It's in nature...
1809054 1814029 the raw, natural power<br />just waiting to be harnessed.
1814033 1818076 When we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire...
1818080 1821009 I mean, just imagine.
1822022 1826026 There's more energy<br />in one cubic mile of seawater...
1826031 1829014 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on earth.
1829018 1833027 I mean, you could drive<br />your car 55 million miles...
1833031 1835077 on a gallon of heavy water.
1835082 1838069 It would be the end<br />of pollution...
1838074 1841028 warmth for the whole world.
1842082 1846070 So why don't I demonstrate<br />for you...
1846074 1850050 why other people in the past<br />have been so unsuccessful?
1852037 1853088 They used very complex...

2025035 2026052 Maybe it's in her head.
2028006 2031090 She needs a poet...<br />an artist...

2098017 2099022 EMMA: What?
2099026 2102047 The sculpture. Do you like it?
2103093 2107048 Oh...yes.
2107052 2109044 What do you love about it?
2119020 2124049 The way it...glows.
2125020 2128046 And how the light...
2128050 2131013 holds him in silence...
2132021 2134030 taking care of him.
2136001 2138059 That's what I like about it.
2142030 2143068 Are you an artist?
2143072 2149027 No. I'm just a traveler<br />searching for purity.
2150023 2153002 -What do you search for?<br />-Energy.
2153007 2154098 Yes.
2157065 2160062 Have you ever been<br />on a long journey?
2160066 2162045 No, not really.
2165029 2167096 Perhaps I'll take you<br />to my home...
2168000 2170021 in Africa.
2170025 2172084 You should<br />experience the energy...
2172088 2174067 of where all life began.
2180051 2183064 Sorry.<br />I'm not very good with people.

2250029 2252080 SIMON: You.
2252084 2256038 You're following me,<br />or it's destiny.
2256042 2258097 Either way, it's weird.
2259001 2260055 Very weird.
2263014 2264068 Destiny then.
2275057 2277040 This must look strange.
2279016 2280041 It's, uh...
2280045 2283054 something that I'm working on...
2283058 2285029 a formula for...
2286033 2288054 creating energy.
2289017 2291029 That you carry around<br />in your underwear?
2293000 2296034 Yeah, I do.
2309027 2311015 How did you do that?
2313015 2315032 Magic.
2315036 2317011 EMMA: Give it back.
2317015 2318070 SIMON: It looks like Sanskrit.
2318074 2320070 Give it back.
2323016 2326012 I'm sorry. I just wanted<br />to watch you put it away.
2328037 2330059 What else do you keep in there?
2331042 2332055 Nothing.
2332059 2334001 SIMON: That's not true.
2335072 2338051 SERVER: Can I get you<br />anything else?
2341005 2345027 SIMON: Drink your wine.<br />Latour '57.
2346094 2350048 WAITER: The Latour, sir,<br />is $400 a bottle.
2354074 2356095 Then we'll have two bottles.
2360024 2362004 There. You count it.

2378014 2380018 SIMON:<br />What? You must. Everything.
2380022 2382077 EMMA: [WHISPERING]<br />It's a secret.
2382081 2383097 SIMON: What?
2385094 2387048 I'm done.
2390015 2393040 My energy research--<br />I'm finished.
2393044 2396086 I still have some sequencing<br />that I have to work out...
2396091 2400012 to make sure that it's safe,<br />but I did it.
2401037 2404096 It's just been you against<br />the whole world, hasn't it?
2405000 2407067 How have you done it<br />and stayed so positive?
2407071 2409042 The gift of faith.
2411025 2413055 To see...
2414097 2416034 Well...
2416038 2420001 to believe in something<br />that's all around us...
2421006 2424018 but hidden from our sight.
2424093 2426077 SIMON:<br />That's a beautiful thought.
2426081 2428090 EMMA: I can't believe<br />I'm telling you this.
2430057 2433015 I don't even know your name.
2433019 2434074 Well, my name is...
2436045 2437095 I don't want to tell you.
2437099 2440012 I don't want to do that.
2442004 2444075 I don't want to do that.<br />What difference does it make?

2449059 2451088 -Emma.<br />-Emma.
2451092 2454067 Now I know<br />everything about you.
2456001 2458064 Your...genius.
2460068 2462047 You have a weak heart.
2466019 2470023 You have beautiful dreams,<br />great courage.
2471036 2473094 You're not afraid in this world.
2473099 2475095 You get that from your father.
2478028 2480083 You can't cook<br />to save your life...
2482004 2483037 and you love fish.
2485087 2487050 I do love fish.
2488058 2490084 That's weird.
2490088 2492051 I want to try that.
2492055 2494013 -No.<br />-Yes.
2494017 2496018 I don't want you to.<br />Drink your wine.
2498068 2499089 EMMA: Yes, I do.
2501022 2502056 What's your name?
2504014 2506065 My name is Thomas More.
2506069 2510032 I was named after the saint...
2511086 2515024 who died for his faith.
2517011 2518028 OK.
2520083 2522004 Your work...
2523054 2527013 is very dangerous...<br />and alive...
2528042 2530017 and I love your poems.
2530096 2532038 They move me.
2534017 2536005 But that's not<br />who you really are.
2538005 2539051 You're running away from...
2540060 2543031 your past and your pain...
2543093 2547065 and yet you keep it<br />so close to you.
2550027 2554011 So you don't have to be afraid<br />of who you are...
2556028 2558020 because you're beautiful.
2617005 2618039 What are you doing?
2636007 2641012 EMMA: Oh, my God,<br />you're bleeding. What happened?
2641016 2643041 SIMON: Don't know. I was...
2643046 2646067 weeping, and I slipped.
2646071 2649013 I was thinking of you.<br />I don't know.
2649017 2651042 EMMA:<br />I live right down the street.
2651046 2653022 I could clean you up.
2654055 2656051 Why do you cover your mouth<br />when you laugh?
2656055 2657085 -I don't know.<br />-Wait.
2662039 2663098 I'm glad it stopped bleeding.
2666006 2667044 Don't need stitches.

2695005 2696097 Yeah.

2772068 2774039 You make me feel so good.

5929008 5933041 You heard about this morning's<br />sensational events.
5933046 5936058 Many shocking documents<br />were recovered...
5936063 5938088 from the president's<br />secret files...
5938092 5941059 locked within his private safe.
5941059 5946055 The documents which will be<br />published in today's papers...
5946060 5950093 prove that the traitor Karpov...
5950093 5954081 was about to steal<br />over 40 trillion...
5954085 5957073 of our precious<br />Russian rubles...
5957077 5962044 in a reckless scheme<br />to save his hide!
5962044 5964045 To add insult...
5964049 5967045 millions of dollars<br />were to be paid...
5967045 5970058 to this international criminal!
5970062 5972096 [CROWD REACTING]
5977054 5979059 {\an8}TRETIAK: And for what<br />was your president...
5979063 5983080 hoping to bankrupt<br />our national treasury?
5983080 5989014 What you see is a fairy tale<br />called cold fusion.
5989014 5994010 You pass electric current<br />into the machine...
5994014 5998040 and there is supposed<br />to be a chemical reaction.
5998044 6000003 Watch. [BEEP]
6000007 6003070 It can't even light up<br />a tiny light bulb!
6003074 6006020 Do you dare deny this,<br />Mr. Karpov?
6006024 6008045 KARPOV: Absolutely not!
6008049 6010083 I proudly admit it!
6010083 6013096 TRETIAK:<br />But enough puny failure.
6014000 6016013 Failure's in the past!
6016017 6019042 Begging is behind us!
6019046 6024026 The balance of power<br />is about to shift!
6057017 6059021 Miracle one.
6063059 6066035 {\an8}CROWD: Karpov! Karpov!
6066039 6068031 Karpov! Karpov!
6068035 6070060 Karpov! Karpov!
6070064 6072081 Karpov! Karpov!
6072085 6075006 Karpov! Karpov!
6075010 6077086 Karpov! Karpov!

6079082 6082024 Karpov! Karpov!
6082024 6084028 Karpov! Karpov!
6091058 6092071 TRETIAK: Ilya! Ilya!
6092075 6094013 ILYA: Go! Go!
6094017 6095071 Go, go, go!
6097025 6101072 SKLAROV: I order all troops<br />loyal to mother Russia...
6101076 6105022 to seize the criminal Tretiak!
6110077 6112039 A thousand apologies,<br />Mr. President.
6112044 6115081 There was a miscommunication<br />somewhere in the chain of command.
6122028 6123070 [THINKING]<br />Miracle two.
6123078 6126099 NEWSWOMAN: The billionaire<br />industrialist and his son, Ilya,...
6127003 6129058 were taken to the infamous<br />Lubyanka prison...
6129062 6133096 where they await trial<br />along with General Leo Sklarov.
6133096 6137075 Moscow woke today to the<br />forgotten sensation of warmth...
6137080 6140005 as millions of gallons<br />of heating oil...
6140009 6143080 flowed from a storage depot discovered<br />beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.
6143080 6146047 INSPECTOR: He made no threat<br />to contact you in the future?
6147035 6148077 EMMA: He never had the chance.
6148081 6150031 You'll tell us<br />if he does make contact?
6150056 6153014 - EMMA: Oh, yes.<br />- Which he may well do.
6153069 6155069 He's a proper rogue, you see.
6155073 6159032 He charms women,<br />this so-called Saint.
6159036 6162028 It seems it's his stock<br />in trade. No offense.
6162032 6166016 Well, I am offended.<br />All I got from this Saint...
6166020 6168062 was a series<br />of near-death experiences.
6168066 6170054 Count yourself lucky.
6170054 6174017 Look, I have a very important<br />conference I must prepare for.
6174021 6176055 INSPECTOR: We understand.<br />You have a life.
6176059 6178030 WOMAN: We appreciate<br />your taking the time.
6178034 6179084 EMMA: No problem.
6186035 6188035 INSPECTOR:<br />She's in love with him.
6247033 6248079 [GIGGLING]
6258080 6261063 SIMON: I wanted to call you<br />and tell you everything.
6261068 6262089 It hasn't been safe.
6262093 6265055 EMMA: I couldn't stop<br />thinking about you.
6267081 6272085 SIMON:<br />So...have you been busy?
6272090 6275015 EMMA: Yeah.<br />I've been working real hard.
6275015 6277098 Thank God I have my cards back.
6277098 6281061 SIMON: You don't believe in<br />this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?
6281065 6284032 You know,<br />you're a very pretty lady.
6284037 6286066 EMMA: Oh, my God.
6286070 6288016 That was you?
6289016 6291062 SIMON: That's who I thought<br />Dr. Russell would like.
6292071 6295029 I thought you were<br />some old biddy...
6295034 6298071 not some gorgeous<br />soon-to-be-trillionaire.
6298076 6301068 You know you're going to be<br />the richest woman in the world.
6301072 6302084 EMMA: I am?
6302089 6305081 SIMON: Why do you think<br />I'm hanging around?
6312027 6313040 -Emma.<br />-Yeah?
6313044 6315019 My life is very strange.
6316015 6317048 I just...
6321045 6323062 I don't do anything normal.
6323066 6325020 I'm--I can't even--
6325024 6328071 I know. I know you.
6329091 6332033 I know your life.
6332038 6335000 -What do you want?<br />-I want you.
6335005 6337009 For how long?
6337013 6339013 It doesn't matter.
6346006 6347077 Tell me you love me.
6349069 6351035 I--I love you.
6352044 6353061 Simon.
6355007 6357028 I love you, Simon.
6358053 6360057 Miracle three.
6384010 6386010 EMMA: Dear Simon...
6386014 6389052 the pin is something I've kept for years.<br />God knows why.
6389056 6392098 {\an8}A graduation gift<br />from Catholic school.
6393002 6395057 But don't worry.<br />You don't have to wear it.
6395061 6398007 I just wanted you<br />to have something of mine...
6398011 6400024 {\an8}something I loved.
6400028 6403016 Simon, if sainthood<br />requires three miracles...
6403020 6405095 then I'd say you've made it,<br />my love...
6405099 6408016 and so I hope you'll understand.
6408020 6411079 Last night, it became clear<br />what I have to do this morning.
6411083 6415017 I'm going to give<br />cold fusion to the world.
6415021 6418009 It's the only way,<br />if we're ever together again...
6418013 6421097 that I'll know it's for you,<br />and you'll know it's for me.
6421097 6427014 If cold fusion is free,<br />then you and I, Simon,  will be free, too.
6427018 6430044 Listen. If you think giving away<br />everything before the world...
6430048 6432081 preventing us from making<br />an unimaginable fortune...
6432086 6434098 will accomplish anything...
6436019 6437090 you're absolutely right.
6439049 6441045 Simon, what are you doing here?
6441049 6443095 There are police.
6443099 6445045 They're everywhere.
6445049 6447083 I wouldn't miss it<br />for the world.
6447087 6450092 -You wore the pin.<br />-Of course.
6454088 6456005 You better go.
6469098 6471031 How will I find you?
6471035 6473031 [GIGGLES]
6473036 6476019 I'll find you. You found me.
6495005 6497063 [APPLAUSE]
6503035 6506043 Although our next speaker<br />requires no introduction...
6506048 6511002 after last week's<br />Moscow fireworks...
6511006 6515048 please let me welcome<br />Dr. E.J. Russell.
6515053 6519040 SIMON: Excuse me.<br />Is this seat taken?
6519045 6522045 No.
6522049 6524029 CHAIRMAN: Dr. Russell?
6533034 6536026 You don't believe in all this<br />cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?
6536026 6537092 EMMA:<br />Thank you. Good morning.
6537097 6539047 INSPECTOR: No.
6539051 6543072 We all know cold fusion<br />has had a...
6543076 6546073 a difficult childhood.
6546077 6549039 Those of us in the field<br />are orphans...
6549044 6551040 bastards, at best.
6551044 6556057 But difficult childhoods, I believe,<br />make the most interesting adults.
6558007 6561066 I know most of you thought<br />that cold fusion...
6561070 6563012 SIMON: I'm her biggest fan.
6563016 6566000 I think she's a fox.<br />Look at that.
6566000 6567016 EMMA: Even though<br />some of you may feel...
6567016 6569004 EMMA: Even though<br />some of you may feel...
6569008 6572084 that its practical application<br />is still somewhat speculative...
6572088 6577013 I've come here today to share<br />how that dream is slowly...
6577017 6578093 becoming a reality.
6578097 6581085 Yes, it may take years<br />to finally learn...
6581089 6583085 SIMON: Look at the time.<br />Got to go.
6583089 6587052 EMMA: ...stabilize its power,<br />but with your help...
6587056 6590056 we can all work towards<br />making the--the...
6591073 6596019 dream of cold fusion<br />finally come true.
6620039 6621051 Quickly!
6621055 6623039 We got him!
6623039 6625035 Hyah!
6627006 6628085 INSPECTOR:<br />Hands behind your back!
6628089 6630098 Got you, you slippery--
6631002 6632027 MAN: What's going on?
6638053 6639078 Damn!
6646075 6648067 REPORTER: Donations totaling<br />three billion dollars...
6648071 6650067 were made today<br />to the Red Cross....
6650071 6652005 the Salvation Army...
6652009 6653084 and the United Nations<br />Children's Fund.
6653088 6655059 The funds were wired<br />from the account...
6655063 6658072 of jailed Russian tycoon<br />Ivan Tretiak.
6658076 6660072 In other philanthropic news...
6660076 6663010 {\an8}a nonprofit<br />research foundation...
6663014 6667027 {\an8}has been established to develop<br />cold fusion technology...
6667027 6669056 {\an8}funded with<br />an anonymous donation...
6669060 6673065 {\an8}and to be headed by Russian<br />physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.
