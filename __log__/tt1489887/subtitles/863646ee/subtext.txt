119786 120993 Where was this energy
120996 123283 at my inauguration assembly, folks?
123332 124539 - True.<br />- I hope
124541 126157 I never have to see any of you

129004 131462 Go, Crocketts!
131465 133047 Boom.
133091 136255 Principal Brown?
136261 138344 Hi, Molly, Amy.<br />What's shakin'?
138388 140700 I want to make the transition<br />of next year's student government
140724 142827 as seamless as possible,<br />so that when I'm up in New Haven...
142851 145343 Yale. You can just say Yale, please.
145354 147562 Well, our class's official policy is
147606 149848 to not discuss where anyone<br />is attending next year.
149900 151766 We don't want them to feel insecure.
151818 152777 Very thoughtful.
152778 154297 Anyway, I need to go over<br />the end-of-the-year
154321 155279 budget numbers we have.
155280 158023 Oh, gosh.
158075 160738 Really? Like, now?
160786 162263 What... I mean, why don't you<br />do it with Nick,
162287 163287 you know? Please?
163330 165287 I mean, he's you know,<br />he's the vice president.
165332 166823 Nick?
168669 170456 We both know that Nick only ran for VP
170504 171522 because they plan the dances.
171546 172753 That position is...
173548 175540 It's basically a popularity contest.<br />He's useless.
175550 178509 Ladies, it's the last day.<br />You know?
178512 181220 We did it. Huh? We got you<br />through high school.
181264 182300 Can't we just graduate,
182307 183307 head off to college,
183350 185933 you know, celebrate this<br />wonderful achievement?
186019 187806 Let's focus on getting through<br />the rest of the day without...
187813 189374 I'm sorry. Are you<br />shutting the door on us?
189398 191185 Because that's not subtle.<br />We will persist!
192567 194433 Nick's like the great equalizer.
195320 197528 Delegates from every group of girls
197572 199564 are casting their ballots for his penis.
199700 202033 Oh, and Triple A takes the lead.
202035 203697 Don't call her that.
203745 205111 Everybody calls her that.
205163 206370 She gave roadside assistance
206415 207642 to three senior guys last year.
207666 209783 You hear them<br />getting degrading Nicknames?
209835 211497 They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."
211545 214458 That's not derogatory.<br />It's a factual description.
214506 216042 7:20.
216049 218462 Under eight minutes?<br />You're joking!
218468 220460 - Oh, my god. 9:43.<br />- What?
220512 222629 What am I gonna do<br />without you girls next year?
222681 224889 Nobody around here<br />even attempts the Thursday.
224933 226094 Well, Amy and I are gonna skype
226101 227387 the puzzle every single week,
227394 228996 - so we will send you our <i>Sunday Times.</i><br />- Yep.
229020 231165 You know what?<br />Why don't I just give you two my number?
231189 233351 That way, you guys can call or text me
233400 234607 if you need anything.
234651 235732 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
235777 236963 That would just make our lives.
236987 238228 - Okay.<br />- Definitely.
238280 239737 - I'll give you mine after.<br />- Oh, no, no,
239740 240856 - I'll just share the contact.<br />- I can just...
240866 242552 - I'm gonna share the contact.<br />- Wait, wait, wait.
242576 244679 Miss Fine, I thought there were<br />no cell phones allowed in class.
244703 246615 Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?
246621 248829 Hey! A dollar in the swear jar.
248874 251537 I'm so sorry. These shorts,<br />they don't have pockets.
251585 253146 - Okay, excuse me.<br />- Whoa, Triple A!
253170 254456 Excuse me. Jesus Christ!
254463 255704 Oh, my god.
255714 258172 No spatial awareness<br />at this school.
258258 259544 - Hey, Amy.<br />- It's her.
259593 260879 Yeah?
260927 262884 Did you just score<br />your teacher's phone number?
263013 264379 Yeah.
264431 265592 Nice.
268727 271765 Hey, Miss Fine? You should<br />come party with us tonight.
271813 273224 Did you just ask Miss Fine
273231 275188 if she wants to party with you?
275233 276794 You think she wants to watch<br />you and your friends
276818 278337 - get drunk and break things?<br />- Yeah, sorry, hold on.
278361 279714 I was having the conversation with her.
279738 281758 - You were not part of this, so...<br />- Sit down, Theo.
281782 284365 Yo, yo, what up, Miss Fine?
284409 286512 Just wanted to drop off a last-day present<br />for my favorite teach.
286536 288573 Jared, you are not my student.
288622 290079 I've heard great things.<br />And hey, everybody else
290081 293040 got their graduation gifts.<br />Right?
293043 296161 Come on. Jare-Bear comin'<br />at you from all angles, right?
296213 297440 Nobody asked for that.
297464 299205 Big me, littler me,
299216 300548 little baby Jared at the bottom.
300592 302800 Baby Jared says,<br />"Happy graduation, everybody."
302844 304176 Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt
304179 305920 with your face on it, Jared.
306014 307801 Like, not even ironically.
307849 310182 Okay, well, agree to disagree.
310227 311559 Jared, just go.
311603 312969 I'm out of here.<br />Wasn't even here.
312979 313979 See you, Molly.
313980 316097 - Bye, Molly.<br />- I'll see ya.
316149 317640 - Bye, Molly.<br />- Why does he...
317651 318711 Why does he always do that?
318735 319896 Fair townspeople!
319986 322023 Fa-fair townspeople!
322155 323612 Fair townspeople,<br />I swear to god!
324366 326483 Mark thy calendars
326535 328276 and make thy plans to attend
328286 330699 the drama department's summer program,
330831 333164 "Shakespeare in the Parking Lot."
334292 336875 We will be performing the bard's comedies
336920 338456 as modern tragedies
338463 340546 outside Whole Foods across town.
340632 342669 It was actually funny.<br />It's, it's what we did
342676 343917 in my summer program
343927 345884 last year in Barcelona.
345887 348425 When I lived in Barcelona.
348515 351929 I will be directing, and Alan...
351935 354769 may be starring, pending auditions.
354771 356433 I don't audition.
357190 358476 I'm offer-only.
359359 361396 This looks fun, but I'm not gonna,
361403 362610 I'm not gonna be here.
362612 364399 Yeah, Amy's spending<br />the summer in Botswana
364447 365983 helping women make their own tampons.
366074 368236 That's... gross.
368285 370993 Well, blood attracts lions.<br />I'm saving lives.
371079 372866 Oh, okay.<br />Well, that's actually noble.
372914 374826 I, too, have a fear of big cats.
374875 377288 And I can't, because<br />I'm working all summer,
377335 378667 and also I don't want to.
378712 379712 You are a philistine.
379713 381875 Why would you do theater<br />when you could do debate?
381923 384415 Because some of us<br />enjoy working with others.
384467 385924 And some of us know how to win.
385927 387964 Nobody's winning in that outfit.
387971 389615 Sit down, y'all.<br />We got work to do.
389639 390925 So, Molly...
390932 392639 - Mm?<br />- Why don't you start us off?
392642 393953 - Thank you, Miss Fine.<br />- Kill it.
393977 395684 All right, well, as you might recall
395729 397015 from my analysis yesterday,
397063 398082 - we were talking about...<br />- It's our last day.
398106 399584 ...the idea<br />of submitting to authority.
399608 400668 Let us live! Oh, my god!
401735 402851 You got to open your mouth
402861 404978 a little here more, boy.
405030 405946 Okay, I got you, I got you,
405947 407233 - I got you, I got you.<br />- Okay, chips!
407240 408651 I got you. You ready?
408700 410111 Dude, how am I supposed to get that?
410118 411118 - Okay, that was my bad.<br />- Nick?
411119 412360 You're wild.<br />Wait, wait, wait.
412370 413736 - Nick.<br />- Just one second.
413747 415283 Nick, there's some<br />student government stuff
415290 416497 - we have to go over.<br />- Come on, man!
416499 417894 - Aim for my mouth!<br />- We have to go over
417918 419729 the end-of-the-year budget,<br />so if you could just...
419753 421494 Yeah, just...<br />Uh, we're playing this game
421504 423120 where I gotta catch it in my mouth.<br />It's complicated.
423131 424747 I'll holler at you later, I guess.
424758 427000 - I'm sure it's complicated.<br />- Oh.
427010 429753 I cannot believe I lasted an entire year
429804 431420 with Nick as my vice president.
431473 432964 He's allergic to work.
432974 434215 All he wants to do<br />is goof off.

521438 524101 Well, that's just her gender performance.
524107 525626 It's different from<br />her sexual orientation.
525650 527061 I'm sorry, but I don't get it.
527110 528337 Well, gender is a construct of...
528361 529647 No, thank you,
529654 531566 that much I understand.<br />It just...

539748 541831 It's just is not,<br />it's not what I anticipated.

545378 547210 and she's got<br />a really cute smile.
547255 550373 She just seems like she'd be<br />a really fun person

552385 553717 Excuse me? Pardon me?

658116 660073 Until all of us can pee without genitals,
660118 661734 none of us can.
661786 663448 These motherfuckers.
664414 665450 Your ugly what?
666207 667914 How did you graduate sixth grade?
667959 669621 It's shocking to me.
669669 672958 Okay. So, I would<br />marry the sex doll.
673006 674150 - Right.<br />- Okay.
674174 675381 Fuck the soccer ball.
675425 677291 - Yep.<br />- And then kill Molly.
677343 679005 Dude! No.
679053 681466 There's no other way, dude.<br />Like, I can't fuck her
681514 682925 you know, 'cause when I'm scared,
682974 684090 my dick can't get hard.
684142 685974 And then like, I can't marry her,
685977 687218 'cause, well, I don't believe
687228 688685 - in the institution.<br />- Uh-huh.
688730 690437 So, I have to kill Molly.
690440 692602 And I know it'll haunt me.<br />I'm a peaceful person.
692650 694767 That's very true.
694819 696776 Wait, are you guys talking<br />about Molly Davidson?
696821 697840 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
697864 699133 That girl is so weird.
699157 700739 She always acts like she's like 40.
700783 702399 I wish she was fucking 40, man.
702452 703846 Women in their 40s know themselves.
703870 705702 Oh, she's, she's cute.
705705 707287 You know, yeah, I'll give her that,
707332 708475 but she'd probably make you quiz
708499 710707 on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.
710752 712835 Dude, no. Her vagina's<br />probably stuffed with diplomas.
712837 713837 How much you wanna bet?
713838 715795 That shit' s like<br />a filing cabinet down there.
715840 718548 Well, I got no problem<br />with a filing cabinet.
718593 721631 I would make passionate sex<br />to Molly Davidson.
721679 722760 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
722805 724546 I'd just put a bag over her personality.
724557 726890 Yeah.
726976 729263 Molly's like a butterface for personality.
729270 730270 A butter-personality.
731397 733104 Yeah! That's it.
733149 734731 So bad.
734776 736859 That's cool, man, yeah.
736861 738102 What?
738154 739770 Shit.
743326 744737 Oh.
744786 746994 Oh, please do not stop on my account.
747872 751286 Do you know what?<br />My vag is stuffed with diplomas.
751334 754293 Soon, it's gonna be stuffed<br />with job offers
754337 755578 and glowing profiles
755630 758088 and commendations from the governor.
758132 762172 So, while you guys were<br />all studying AP handjobs,
762178 764340 I was kicking ass and busting curves,
764389 765532 and I'm gonna continue to do that
765556 767764 at Yale next year, so...
768893 769893 I like my choices,
769894 772307 and wherever you three are next year,<br />I hope you do, too.
773690 774771 I'm going to Yale, too.
777902 778938 What?
778987 780649 I'm incredible at handjobs,
780697 783189 but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.
784325 785486 No, you didn't.
785535 786776 I got in early.
786869 788531 - To Yale?<br />- Uh-huh.
788579 790445 - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.<br />- Mm-hmm.
790498 792956 Oh, and, Tanner,<br />where are you going to school?
793001 795835 Uh, I'm, I'm playing soccer at Stanford.
795878 797619 Stanford University?
797672 799038 What are you guys talking about?
799090 801798 - Yeah, Stanford.<br />- Mm-hmm. Stanford University.
801884 803967 Hey, I'm not going to college.
804012 806049 I got recruited to go code for Google.
806055 808092 I mean, it's not Apple,
808099 810307 but the bennies are pretty tight, man,
810351 812388 and it's mid six-figures,<br />so I'm not complaining.
812478 814206 - My boy. That's my boy.<br />- I'm so proud of you. It's amazing.
814230 816563 You failed the seventh grade twice.
816607 817893 Rule of threes.
820486 822166 - You guys are serious?<br />- Mm-hmm.
822864 824821 Hey, um, I might pretend
824824 826690 like I don't know you next year.
826701 827737 No offense.
828661 830368 Hmm. This...
830413 831779 This isn't possible.
831831 833618 You guys don't even care about school.
834751 838165 No, we just don't only care about school.
847013 848013 Well, I'm, I'm done.
848056 849968 All right. After you. After you.
850016 851016 Okay.

885301 886259 - Hope!<br />- No.

977351 979092 We chose.<br />We didn't party,
979145 981262 because we wanted to focus on school
981314 982771 and get into good colleges.
982815 983851 And it worked.
983900 986108 But the irresponsible people who partied
986152 987484 also got into those colleges.
987528 988528 They did both.
988571 991109 - So?<br />- So, we messed up.
991157 992989 We didn't have to choose.<br />They did both.

1005796 1007958 We have to go<br />to a party tonight.
1008007 1010420 - What?<br />- Let's go to Nick's party.
1010468 1012209 Na, are you kidding?<br />No! No way.
1012261 1014924 Amy, we only have one night left
1014972 1016804 to have studied<br />and partied in high school.
1016849 1019637 Otherwise, we're just gonna be<br />the girls that missed out!
1019685 1022428 We haven't done anything!<br />We haven't broken any rules!
1022480 1025314 Okay. We've broken a lot of rules.
1025358 1026974 One, we have fake IDs.
1027026 1028267 Fake college IDs,
1028319 1030527 so we can get into<br />their 24-hour library.
1030571 1032904 Name one person<br />whose life was so much better
1032949 1034941 - because they broke a couple of rules.<br />- Picasso.

1037537 1038805 - Rosa Parks.<br />- Name another one.

1040665 1043749 Amy, I'm so serious.<br />They think that we're robots.
1043793 1045000 They think all we care about
1045044 1047127 is taking a million APs<br />and getting into Yale
1047171 1049037 and editing law review at Georgetown,
1049090 1051360 and clerking for a federal judge<br />between junior and senior year
1051384 1052920 before eventually becoming
1052969 1055507 the youngest justice ever nominated
1055555 1058389 to the Supreme Court of the United States!

1064814 1066680 Nobody knows that we are fun.
1066732 1068598 - We know.<br />- They need to know.
1068651 1071519 - Who's "they"?<br />- We are not one-dimensional.
1071571 1073608 We are smart and fun.

1081080 1083242 You know that we are too smart for that.

1092842 1094708 I want you to experience this.

1164538 1165654 flip it upside down.
1165706 1167538 Well, I don't, I don't really...
1167583 1169700 Just a down, but a flip.
1169710 1171292 - I don't...<br />- A down flip.
1171379 1173712 What if I don't use my hands?
1173798 1176336 You can make yourself come<br />using only your mind?
1176342 1177583 - No!<br />- That's the one thing
1177593 1179050 - my mind can't do.<br />- No!

1180971 1182052 other stuff.
1183140 1184426 - A book?<br />- No.

1196862 1198194 It's the panda, okay?
1198280 1200442 The panda. Whatever. Just...
1200533 1203025 Argh. Can we just stop talking about this,
1203119 1205782 please, for the love of all things?
1205788 1206949 Quick question.
1206997 1208863 Just a quick Q.
1208958 1210449 What happened to her eye?
1212128 1214495 That fell off way before<br />anything happened between us.
1214547 1216709 - Does she talk dirty to you?<br />- Mm-mm.
1217508 1219249 Tell you about how she's endangered?
1219343 1220629 No!
1220636 1222593 - Stop!<br />- Do pandas roar?
1222680 1223638 Stop!
1223639 1225505 You sneaky little bitch!
1225558 1227390 I can't believe you didn't tell me
1227393 1230056 that you have been mounting<br />that tragic panda
1230146 1231728 every single night!
1231814 1233726 - Yeah.<br />- This is honestly, it's exhilarating.
1233733 1235474 I thought I knew everything about you.
1235568 1237104 I think it's healthy for a relationship
1237111 1238852 to have secrets, and now we have one.
1238946 1241563 Do I have a secret for you?<br />Okay, yes.
1241574 1242815 - Uh-huh.<br />- Yeah.
1242825 1244566 I once tried to masturbate
1245453 1247445 with an electric toothbrush.
1248205 1250492 But I got a horrible UTI.
1250541 1254330 Horrible. Like... horrible.
1254420 1256457 I wish that would've been a secret,
1256464 1259252 but you've mentioned it many, many times.
1261594 1265258 Hey, hey!<br />I need you to do the talking.
1265306 1267639 Why don't you just tell them<br />we're going to a party?
1267641 1269348 Because they'll ask too many questions.
1269351 1270579 They'll try to call Nick's aunt.
1270603 1273095 I've never lied to my parents before.
1273147 1275355 And you know when I lie,<br />I just add too many details.
1276108 1278350 Just, just make up a story, but don't say
1278402 1279893 we're having a date night or anything.
1279904 1282271 Why? It's funny your parents<br />think we're boning.
1282364 1284481 No, it's not, because you're not the one
1284533 1286490 who has to deal with their creepy smiles
1286494 1288486 when I tell them I'm meeting<br />you at the library,
1288496 1290988 when I'm actually<br />meeting you at the library.
1290998 1293786 Honestly, it's surprising<br />that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,
1293793 1296001 considering their whole Jesus thing.<br />It's nice.
1296086 1297952 Charmaine, get to the safe room.
1297963 1299579 - Hey!<br />- We're being robbed by super models!
1299590 1301877 Aw, you girls look fabulous!
1301884 1304126 And smart and also brave.
1304178 1305385 - Thank you.<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1305471 1306471 Wait, are you guys cold?
1306555 1308137 - A little.<br />- Just a little nippy.
1308182 1309140 I'll start a fire!
1309141 1310786 Or I'll turn up the heat.<br />Just get the jackets off.
1310810 1312142 Dinner's about ready.
1312144 1313663 - Oh, well...<br />- You gotta taste this.
1313687 1314848 - Yeah.<br />- I'm calling it
1314897 1316058 "diplo-meatball."
1317274 1318274 - Sure!<br />- Don't engage, don't engage.
1318275 1319275 Oh, right. Right, okay.
1319276 1321563 Um, Char-Char. Dougsicles.
1321654 1325694 Would it be okay if Amy stayed<br />over at my house tonight?
1328536 1331620 - The, the, the night before graduation?<br />- Well...
1331747 1334285 Yeah. you know, my mom<br />can drive us to the ceremony.
1334291 1336157 We just want as much time<br />together as we can
1336168 1338285 before she leaves for Africa.
1338337 1341705 We made, uh, mushroom cap and gowns.
1341799 1344633 We made special names for all this stuff.
1344635 1346547 Great deal of care was taken.
1346554 1349262 - Well...<br />- Every... I mean, look at...

1750290 1751309 - Didn't I, Jared?<br />- You did. She said it.
1751333 1752949 I told him. Those guys seem quiet,
1752960 1754576 but they're probably spending<br />every weekend
1754586 1755827 at, like, a sex dungeon.
1755879 1756837 - No.<br />- Nope.

1824865 1826606 Take the helmet off!
1826658 1828490 Take the helmet off!
1830370 1831906 This isn't working.
1831913 1833495 You can't buy people's affection.
1835334 1836370 Um...
1838211 1841454 Mmm... no, I'm pretty sure you can,
1841506 1843372 'cause I've seen it a lot.
1843383 1846217 My parents did it.<br />Their parents did it.
1846219 1847739 Just stop trying so hard, okay.
1847763 1849282 People can sense it.<br />It turns them off.
1849306 1850513 But you try hard.
1851683 1854243 I mean, you try hard at everything.<br />That's what I like about you.
1856021 1857040 - I didn't mean it like...<br />- Uh, no.
1857064 1858022 I'm just gonna...
1858023 1859667 - I meant more like...<br />- I'm... I'm gonna go.
1859691 1860691 Lamb meatball?
1860776 1862017 Motherfucker!<br />You're everywhere!
1862110 1864102 One time I ate a legal pot brownie
1864154 1865861 when Model UN went to Amsterdam.
1866740 1869260 And as soon as I got high,<br />I just cried about the fact that one day
1869284 1871025 my mom will die, so...
1871078 1873070 - I had the exact same thing.<br />- Really?
1873121 1875659 I lost my virginity in<br />what I thought was a park,
1875665 1877156 but it turned out to be a graveyard.
1877167 1879159 And now the ghost spirits<br />live inside my eggs,
1879169 1880535 waiting to be reborn.
1880587 1881703 That's not at all the same.
1881755 1883212 I always felt like we were similar.
1883298 1885005 God, I'm gonna miss you.<br />Come here.
1885050 1886008 Hey, you can't smoke up here.
1886009 1887320 - Oh.<br />- What'd you just say to her?
1887344 1888880 I said it to you.<br />You can't smoke.
1888887 1889968 - Um...<br />- Uh-uh-uh.
1889971 1891712 You do not speak<br />to her that way.
1891807 1893548 Is the "her" me?<br />'Cause I'm fine.
1893558 1895971 That is my best friend<br />in the fucking world.
1896061 1897677 We're not. She's not...
1897729 1899265 We'll fucking fight you to the death!
1899272 1901480 Okay! I'm calling security.
1901483 1902849 Amy, we need to get
1902943 1904184 - the fuck out of here...<br />- Oh, my god!

1906571 1907778 It's go time!
1907823 1909610 There's only one thing left to do.
1909616 1910948 Jump.
1911034 1912070 - No<br />- Wait. What?
1912077 1914034 No! No, thank you!<br />No, seriously, Gigi.
1914121 1915532 What're you guys doing up here?
1915539 1918282 - Swan dive into the future!<br />- Grip escape move!
1919209 1921952 No, no, no. Gege. Gege!
1922003 1923869 Holy fuck!

1934307 1937675 Oh, my god! I'm so sweaty!
1937686 1939598 Ugh! My god!
1939688 1942431 We need to figure something out<br />before we get to Nick's.
1942441 1944603 - You still wanna go to Nick's?<br />- You don't?
1944693 1947436 Well, dude, we went to a party.
1947446 1948812 We did it. Let's go home.
1951867 1954405 - Amy?<br />- Don't do your lecture voice.
1954494 1956326 That was not a party.
1956371 1958203 Well, it definitely was a party.
1958206 1959913 That was a detour.
1960000 1962538 We are A-plus people,
1962627 1964744 and we were going to an A-plus party.
1964754 1965790 Like this.
1971428 1972447 Oh, my god. Alan responded.
1972471 1974679 We have the address!<br />Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.
1974764 1977757 Oh, my score is...<br />my score is very low.
1977809 1979425 I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.
1979436 1981348 - You should call for one.<br />- I'm gonna go home.
1981396 1983479 But if you wanna go to Nick's,<br />you should really go.
1983482 1984598 Seriously, go.
1986109 1987270 Malala.
1990697 1991938 Whoa.
1991990 1993731 I'm calling Malala.
1993742 1997611 Wow. You know you only get,<br />like, one Malala a year.
1997704 1999286 Yeah, I'm calling it.
1999289 2001372 Full support, no questions asked,
2001374 2002535 you are coming with me.
2002584 2003620 Hmm.
2006463 2007579 Malala.
2008548 2009548 All right.
2010634 2011592 Malala.
2016681 2018422 Um...
2018475 2020182 Okay. Jordan?
2020227 2021843 Yeah, and you're Amy...
2024606 2026723 Shit.
2034199 2036612 You know, this job's a good way
2036660 2039118 to supplement the, uh, the old income.
2039162 2041324 You know, teachers' salaries<br />today and all, it's...
2041373 2043410 - It's so terrible.<br />- Yeah, it's a disgrace.
2043500 2044536 Yeah, meet new people
2044584 2045728 and see new parts of the city
2045752 2046993 and run into old friends.
2048213 2049374 "Friends"?
2049464 2050671 Plus, I'm writing a book now.
2050715 2052206 - Oh!<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2052259 2053444 - Not just the principal.<br />- Cool.
2053468 2055926 Nothing more exciting or daunting
2055971 2058964 than the blank page, you know?<br />One of the books I'm thinking about doing
2059015 2060117 is a book of quotes.
2060141 2062053 "Nothing more daunting or exciting
2062102 2063684 than the blank page."
2063728 2065515 But yeah, that's one idea.
2065522 2067041 Thinkin' about doing a detective novel.
2067065 2069227 Actually, you know what?<br />You two will love...
2069276 2070483 Amy, you'll love this.
2070527 2072143 It's a female detective.
2072195 2073481 - A lady detective.<br />- Oh, really?
2073530 2074674 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />How about that, right?
2074698 2075656 Interesting.
2075657 2077398 Yeah, and she's pregnant, too.
2077450 2079612 Still workin', and, you know, the baby...
2079661 2081573 whenever she's close to a clue,
2081621 2084534 or one of her hunches is,<br />like, you know, close,
2084583 2086199 the baby kicks. You know?
2086251 2088868 And the harder it kicks,<br />the closer she is,
2088920 2090147 and that's where I'm at right...
2090171 2092333 I... I don't know what to do once, um...
2092382 2095250 you know, when she gives birth, but, um...
2095302 2098170 Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!
2098221 2099507 Choose a lane!
2100390 2102723 That was nuts.<br />I don't know what that was.
2102767 2104487 Oh, this town.
2105020 2107182 Lot of angry people in this town.
2109482 2110563 Yeah.
2116448 2117466 You guys want some music, maybe?
2117490 2119777 - Yeah. Genius.<br />- Yeah.
2123622 2125909 Dude, we're gonna get to Nick's so late.
2125957 2128074 It's fine.<br />Everybody shows up to parties late.
2128168 2130251 It's like... it's cooler to be late.
2130253 2132119 We're gonna arrive right at the crest
2132172 2134066 and before you know it,<br />you'll be neck deep in Ryan.
2134090 2137424 - Neck deep in what direction?<br />- You tell me.
2137469 2140007 I don't know.<br />I don't know anything.
2140055 2141135 This is like your nightmare
2141181 2143013 about having to land a commercial airliner
2143058 2144845 but much, much worse.
2146102 2148890 I mean, is it? Is it worse?
2148938 2150019 Well, yeah.
2150106 2151563 I had the lives of 100 people in my hands.
2151566 2153808 My crew was counting on me.<br />I mean, I was their Sully.
2153902 2155393 - I'm really stressed about it.<br />- I'm...
2155403 2156769 Okay. I know you are.
2156821 2158153 If only there was just...
2159324 2161361 a video of people hookin' up.
2163161 2165153 Sorry, are you talking about porn?
2165205 2166491 - All I'm saying...<br />- No.
2166539 2170579 No one will know if you<br />watched one porn one time.
2170627 2172038 Think of it as a documentary.
2172087 2174625 It's just a sexy documentary.<br />It's a hot doc.
2174673 2177381 All of those women are<br />European trafficking victims.
2177425 2178611 Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging
2178635 2180001 other people's sexual preferences?
2180011 2181405 'Cause you fuck a panda every night.
2181429 2183136 "Fuck a panda."<br />So fucking funny!
2183181 2184717 Are you about to say you're gonna judge me
2184724 2186511 for dabbling in pornography?
2186518 2188037 I thought you were<br />a sex-positive feminist.
2188061 2189597 Are you insane?
2190397 2192480 Principal Brown is right there!
2192524 2194686 - I have headphones.<br />- He's four feet away from us.
2194693 2196810 I have headphones, madam.
2198154 2201238 All right, but once we get<br />a sense of the mechanics,
2201241 2203574 I am shutting it off real quick.
2203576 2204692 Of course.
2206496 2207907 It's for educational purposes.
2207956 2209242 Educational purposes.
2211835 2214122 <i>♪ Ow, we want the funk ♪</i>
2214170 2215206 Huh.
2215255 2216416 <i>♪ Give up the funk ♪</i>
2216464 2219002 <i>♪ Ow, we need the funk... ♪</i>
2219008 2220795 Plug in.<br />Your phone's gonna die.
2221803 2222803 Um...
2225598 2226557 Principal Brown?
2226558 2229221 Oh.<br />Principal Brown was my dad.
2229269 2230350 Just call me Jordan.
2230395 2232011 Uh... no, thank you.
2232063 2233349 - Principal Brown?<br />- Yes.
2233398 2235606 Uh, do you have<br />a phone charger?
2235650 2238358 No, I don't. Got, like, 13.
2238361 2240353 Yeah, here.<br />There you go. Catch.
2242782 2244739 I didn't know you could<br />do that from that angle.
2246077 2247989 Oh, wait, what did I miss?
2248037 2249448 - Go back, actually.<br />- Yeah, scroll back?
2249456 2250850 I need to review that part.<br />Wait, it start...
2250874 2251994 - Right there.<br />- Right there.
2253001 2254561 If you guys wanna listen to your music,
2254586 2255827 I can just plug it in up here.
2255879 2257962 - What? No! No!<br />- No, no!
2258006 2259713 No, fuck!
2259758 2262341 <i>That's fuckin' hot.</i>
2265722 2267714 Come on! Come on.
2276024 2277185 Don't touch me.
2279736 2281068 Was that Cardi B?
2285200 2286281 Oh, my god.
2286284 2287470 I can't believe that happened.
2287494 2288951 - You are the devil.<br />- I'm gonna die.
2288953 2291661 I'm literally gonna physically die.
2291706 2293572 Oh, Jesus Christ.
2295794 2298161 Come in.
2298171 2301505 - He's dead!<br />- What the fuck?
2301549 2304087 - He's dead!<br />- Who's dead?
2304093 2307632 My husband. He's been killed!
2307722 2310556 Okay, Alan, you don't have<br />to do your entrance
2310558 2313175 every time somebody arrives,<br />okay?
2314938 2317180 - What are you guys doing here?<br />- What is going on?
2317273 2319981 It's a murder mystery party.
2319984 2321264 I've been planning it<br />for months.
2321319 2323356 Wait. This is your house? Alan!
2323363 2325946 Alan, I was so clear in my text.
2325949 2327861 We were looking<br />for Nick's party!
2327909 2330322 My husband, Robert, was<br />an esteemed Broadway director
2330328 2332445 and the love of my life!
2332455 2336290 And he's been killed<br />like a dog in the street!
2336376 2339414 - Was he stabbed?<br />- That sounds very tragic,
2339420 2340501 but there's been a mistake.
2340505 2341962 We're looking for Nick's party.
2342048 2344210 Do you have the address?<br />We can't find it.
2344217 2345708 I don't know a Nick.
2346469 2348051 I only know sorrow...
2348805 2350046 and grief.
2350139 2351300 Okay, you're at a ten.
2351307 2353048 I need you at a two.
2355144 2357602 I have a wake to plan.
2357689 2359806 Okay, well, if you guys are here,
2359899 2361640 you might as well take some<br />of the extra characters
2361651 2362920 since two people decided not to show up.
2362944 2364435 No.
2364529 2366020 Okay.
2367824 2369156 Adorable farmer, new to the city.
2369200 2370236 - Cool.<br />- No, no, no,
2370326 2371387 - we don't need characters...<br />- Hideous...
2371411 2373903 - ...because we're not staying.<br />- ...barren orthodontist.
2373913 2375074 Why am I barren?
2375123 2377331 Am I here to farm,<br />or have I given up that life?
2377417 2378783 This just says "orthodontist."
2378877 2380834 Your backstories are<br />actually in the packets.
2380837 2382248 No, no, no, we are not staying,
2382297 2383333 and we're going to Nick's party.
2383339 2384358 We can just stay for a second.
2384382 2385463 - No.<br />- Is that the party
2385466 2387583 - where somebody ate a ghost pepper?<br />- Yes.
2387677 2389714 Yeah, somebody here<br />came from there, I think.
2389762 2390798 Maybe the mayor?
2391598 2394011 Go! Immerse yourselves.
2394017 2397260 Review your histories in the parlor.
2397270 2398727 Okay, if your characters aren't married,
2398730 2399730 hands off each other.
2399814 2401771 No.
2403359 2406102 - Do not go gently...<br />- Whoa, she's really good.
2406863 2408104 Oh, my god! You guys are here.
2408156 2409592 - Whoa, what the fuck?<br />- How did you get here?
2409616 2411824 - How did you get here?<br />- And how are you dry?
2411910 2413697 How are you dry?
2413703 2415820 Aaron, I can see you breathing.
2415830 2417787 Gigi, mm, dig deeper.
2417832 2419289 - I don't know what...<br />- I can't think about it.
2421294 2423035 Oh, is it over?
2423129 2425291 No! Stop. Mom, do not talk to the actors.
2425340 2427172 The house is mine until 11:00 p.m.
2427216 2430004 Cindy, I swear to fucking god.
2431888 2434756 - Jesus Christ! God!<br />- Gigi, what the fuck?
2434807 2436469 Guys, the re-election is coming up,
2436601 2438558 and I need to know<br />if I have to buy your votes.
2438603 2439844 Wait. Are you the mayor?
2439938 2441224 Do you know where Nick's party is?
2441230 2443313 Of course I do.<br />I know where all the parties are.
2443399 2446267 - Where is it?<br />- Come into my office. Now.
2446361 2447568 Okay, thank you.
2447570 2449277 In, in, in. Go, go, go.
2449322 2450858 Come, come, come.<br />Now, now, now!
2452617 2453778 Okay.
2454786 2455902 You can't tell anyone.
2455954 2457161 We won't.
2457163 2459029 Not even each other.
2459040 2460656 Okay.
2460667 2462158 Nick's party...
2465964 2468923 ...is at his aunt's house.
2469759 2471466 We know it's at his...
2471511 2474094 Amy, I swear to god,<br />I need to get out of here.
2474138 2476721 By the way, I am pretty impressed
2476724 2478841 with how well you guys<br />are holding it together.
2478893 2480805 You're doing fantastic.
2480853 2482970 What do you mean?
2483022 2485389 I thought the strawberries<br />would have hit by now.
2485441 2487148 Why would strawberries hit?
2487193 2491813 Because they were dipped<br />in an unbelievably potent drug.
2492573 2494656 It's like ayahuasca but asian.
2495702 2497318 Asian-huasca.
2498579 2499695 I told you guys that, right?
2499706 2500913 No, no, no,
2500957 2503916 no, no, no, no!
2505044 2506785 My last words!
2506838 2509171 Pull me back in. Pull me back in.
2509173 2510505 Oh, my god, here.
2513678 2516591 Oh, my mom has a scarf that color.
2516681 2519264 Listen to me.<br />We're gonna be fine.
2519308 2521846 One time I threw up, and my mom caught it
2521853 2524186 in her hands 'cause she loves me.
2524230 2527564 We're healthy, nubile young women,
2527567 2530025 and we just need to stay calm.
2530028 2531028 We are gonna be...
2531029 2532270 Careful.
2551924 2554962 What? What the fuck?
2555762 2558926 What the fuck?<br />What is happening?
2561851 2563558 Why do you look like that?
2563603 2565686 Uh, Molly, you're a fucking doll.
2565730 2568473 - No, you're a fucking doll.<br />- What?
2569317 2571604 Ow! Fuck, that hurt!
2571652 2574235 My boobs are too heavy.<br />I have no core.
2574280 2575896 Our legs don't bend.
2575948 2578065 They're twice as long as our torsos.
2578117 2581656 These proportions are insane!<br />Where's my chub?
2581704 2583036 Wait. Where are you going?
2583831 2585471 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Wait for me!
2585958 2588871 I have to see for myself.
2588920 2590957 Well, I've never done<br />the splits in my life.
2591005 2592837 Amy!
2594092 2595879 Help! Molly, help me!
2595927 2598169 Oh, my god!<br />Don't look down, Amy. No!
2598221 2599632 I... I can't reach.
2599680 2602093 You have to put my heel in your hole.
2602141 2603452 "My heel..."<br />Your heel in my what?
2603476 2604512 Your hole!
2604560 2607052 - What hole?<br />- Your corn hole!
2607105 2608516 Oh. Fuck!
2608564 2611102 - Molly!<br />- There you go.
2612693 2614184 Oh, my god.
2614278 2616110 Um, what the fuck am I wearing?
2617949 2619030 Where's my vag?
2619075 2620532 Uh, Molly, I have no genitals.
2620576 2622659 How do I pee? How do I shit?
2622703 2624160 I mean, I don't even have nipples.
2624205 2625867 These are just mounds.
2625915 2628328 My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.
2628376 2633167 Just... just perfect, round, huge mounds.
2633214 2634796 - Uh, what?<br />- Look at my body.
2634841 2636002 I am beautiful.
2636050 2637791 No. Don't get sucked in.
2637802 2639839 This is our nightmare, Amy.
2639887 2642300 I know this is unrealistic<br />and bad for women,
2642348 2644135 but is it bad?
2644142 2645804 Because I feel pretty good.
2645852 2647388 I mean, this ass won't quit.
2647436 2649428 Amy, use your brain!
2649480 2650641 I don't need to use my brain.
2650690 2653728 I just need to be smooth and flexible.
2653776 2655688 Look at you, you bad bitch.
2656529 2658816 Okay, that's it.<br />We have to wake up.
2658865 2661107 My, my, my. Mmm.
2662326 2663612 I think I might, like,
2663661 2665653 actually stay here for a while.
2665705 2668413 No, I won't let you do this.
2668416 2670373 Stop it, stop it, stop it. Stop.
2670418 2672785 You need to throw up!
2672837 2675796 Let me have this body!
2675840 2677172 Now that the <i>amuse-bouche</i>
2677175 2679007 of bacon-wrapped dates is over,
2679051 2682294 why don't we play<br />a rousing round of<i>... J'accuse!</i>
2689729 2691812 Fuck you, George.
2693524 2694890 Who is she supposed to be?
2695860 2697317 The orthodontist.
2699071 2702189 We're okay. We're okay.
2703284 2705742 We did it.<br />We went to two parties.
2705745 2708829 We did drugs.<br />We can say we went out.
2709749 2711115 Let's go home.
2711125 2713583 What? No, no, the plan is to go to Nick's.
2713628 2715665 We have to stick to the plan.
2716797 2719380 Dude, nothing has gone<br />according to plan tonight.
2719425 2721087 Which is why we have<br />to stick to the plan.
2721135 2722093 Let's call another Lyft.
2722094 2723505 Why are you being so pushy?
2723554 2725170 Honestly, pushy is a compliment.
2725223 2726464 You know who else was pushy?
2726515 2728928 Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,<br />Queen Noor of Jordan...
2728976 2730968 I know where Queen Noor is from.
2731020 2733040 Once we get to Nick's,<br />all of this will be worth it.
2733064 2736023 Just forget about Nick's.<br />No one will even tell us where it is.
2736067 2737899 Why are you being so obsessed<br />with this party?
2737944 2739276 Because she loves him.
2739320 2743064 Oh, my god.<br />Gigi, stop doing that!
2743115 2744902 - What did you say?<br />- Molly loves Nick.
2744909 2747322 Can you please stop<br />repeating that sentence?
2747370 2748781 Because it's not true.
2748829 2750307 - Yeah, Molly hates Nick.<br />- Thank you.
2750331 2752948 She projects disgust<br />to cover up a deep desire...
2753000 2756368 No, no. N-o. Thanks.<br />Uh, you actually...
2756420 2758232 You just drugged us,<br />and you tried to throw us off of a boat.
2758256 2759463 I did. I did.
2759507 2761624 So, nothing you say is<br />of any value to us.
2763636 2765155 Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off
2765179 2767216 because you should flip off,<br />so shut the fuck up.
2767265 2768597 Madam Mayor,
2768599 2770215 what are you doing out here?
2770268 2771804 George locked himself in the closet.
2771852 2773059 Fuck!
2773104 2775346 - Dude.<br />- No.
2778609 2779609 Dude?
2780736 2781772 No.
2782655 2783655 I don't like him.
2784782 2787741 Yes, maybe he is classically,
2787785 2790152 traditionally handsome<br />and weirdly charming,
2790204 2792070 and maybe my innate biology
2792123 2793705 registers him as an ideal mate.
2793749 2795661 And yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize
2795710 2797076 about him sweeping me off my feet,
2797128 2800121 And some weaker people<br />might call that a tiny crush.
2800172 2802209 But I can ignore it,<br />I can fight against it
2802258 2804090 because we all have weird interests,
2804135 2806502 and the important thing is that we just,<br />we shove 'em down,
2806512 2808253 and we never speak about them again.
2809640 2811552 You don't have to shove anything down.
2813060 2814471 Yeah.
2814520 2817137 Yeah, I do, because I can't like him.
2817148 2819356 Maybe my body can like him,
2819400 2820982 but my mind knows that that's stupid
2821027 2822734 because he's just... he's a jock.
2822778 2824770 And all he cares about is<br />being cool and having fun,
2824780 2826567 and he doesn't even look at girls
2826615 2827759 unless they look like Triple A.
2827783 2829319 And he definitely doesn't want me,
2829327 2830784 because I'm a butter-personality.
2832121 2835239 How dare you say that<br />about my best friend.
2835291 2836827 Amy, you fucking slapped me...
2836834 2838895 If you ever say anything like that<br />about yourself again,
2838919 2841912 I will fucking lay you out. Okay?
2841964 2844331 You are the strongest, coolest, smartest,
2844383 2845840 most stunningly gorgeous creature
2845885 2849094 this high school<br />and this earth has ever seen,
2849138 2851630 and Nick Howland<br />would be so fucking lucky
2851682 2853674 to be a footnote in your story.
2854477 2855763 So, we're going to his party.
2855811 2856927 Are you serious?
2856979 2858186 I am dead serious.
2859148 2861640 If Nick's what you want,<br />then that's what you deserve.
2863027 2866611 How? How are we gonna find out<br />where the party is?
2866655 2868066 By doing what we do best.
2868908 2870649 Motherfuckin' homework.

2954368 2955950 Oh, my god.<br />Oh, shit, shit, shit.
2955995 2957406 Is this some Manson family shit?
2957455 2959321 - What is this?<br />- No!
2959373 2961786 No! Everything is gonna be just fine.
2961834 2963103 You're just gonna give us the address
2963127 2964807 to where you delivered<br />some pizzas tonight.
2967339 2969331 Oh, my god.<br />Are you guys out of your fucking mind?
2969341 2970502 How old are you, by the way?
2970551 2972383 Does not matter!
2972428 2974465 Okay, that voice did not make<br />you sound older.
2974513 2976129 So, you're basically children?
2976182 2978549 And you just willingly got<br />in the car of a strange man?
2978601 2979842 Do you guys have a weapon?
2980644 2981760 Yes.
2981812 2983144 If we claim to have a weapon,
2983189 2984646 this might be a felony.
2984690 2985851 Fuck.
2985900 2988734 Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask
2988777 2990689 and trying to rob someone with no weapon.
2990696 2993689 'Cause the funny thing is,<br />I actually have a weapon.
2993699 2994735 Fuck!
2994742 2996233 What the fuck? You have a gun!
2996285 2999278 I keep that to protect myself<br />from bad people.
2999330 3000807 Something you guys<br />should be thinkin' about.
3000831 3002948 Did the possibility of sexual assault
3003000 3004411 ever enter your minds?
3005211 3007828 - Not really.<br />- Yeah, not really, I can tell.
3007880 3010293 You were spending more time<br />on, like, the hair
3010341 3012549 and that whole part of it, maybe, yeah.
3012593 3015176 'Cause, we're, like, right by the freeway.
3015179 3016795 I could have you across the state line
3016847 3018054 in, like, 40 minutes,
3018098 3019589 take you to some cabin,
3019600 3020932 hog-tie your ankles,
3020976 3022888 leave you in a room<br />with, like, a saucer of milk
3022937 3024678 and videotape the whole thing<br />for a couple days.
3024688 3026224 - What?<br />- What? No.
3026273 3027389 - Think about that.<br />- What?
3027441 3029023 No. I'm not gonna think about...
3029068 3030730 We just need you to give us the address
3030736 3032547 to where you delivered<br />this huge order tonight.
3034615 3036356 Oh, shit, that...
3039912 3041653 Okay. You know what?
3042581 3043683 I'm gonna give you the address.
3043707 3045744 I feel like if I don't,
3045793 3047455 you guys are so stupid,
3047503 3049711 some dog walker's gonna find your bodies
3049755 3051337 tomorrow under some overpass.
3051340 3052421 - Okay.<br />- Whoa!
3052424 3054165 Don't show me your pass code.
3054218 3055487 Oh, that's fair.<br />Okay, I'm sorry.
3055511 3057071 That's the whole thing with pass codes.
3057096 3058553 I'm just copying the address.
3058597 3061089 Yeah, that's your private information.
3061183 3063800 Thank you! Thank you so much!
3063852 3065184 Oh, my god.
3065187 3066428 Um...
3066438 3067645 Quick Q.
3067648 3069435 Now that we're already in your car,
3069441 3071057 would you mind driving us there?
3072736 3074068 - Yeah, why not?<br />- Oh, great!
3074071 3075437 I'm being sarcastic!
3075489 3077196 - Get the fuck out of my car!<br />- Oh, okay.
3077199 3078468 Thank you so much for your help!
3078492 3080950 Don't trust people.<br />Oh, my god.
3081036 3083449 Yes! Yes!
3083497 3084829 Yes! Oh, my god!
3084873 3087661 You were incredible!<br />You were so scary!
3087710 3089372 If you were a criminal, you'd be
3089420 3091537 the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.
3092673 3095290 Okay, all right, let's call a chariot.
3098762 3101550 Fuck, I left my phone in his car!
3101640 3104553 Why did I have to use<br />the visual aid? Wait!
3104560 3106643 It's okay. Amy! Amy!<br />We will get it tomorrow.
3106645 3108307 It's fine. I'll use mine.<br />I'll use mine.
3109064 3110305 Wha... I'm at two percent?
3110399 3111515 Why the fuck am I at two percent?
3111525 3113016 Why is my battery so low?
3113819 3117187 Porn. We streamed a lot of porn.
3117197 3118813 - Just call a Lyft.<br />- Fuck.
3118824 3121783 No, I can't call a Lyft,<br />because if my phone dies
3121785 3123993 and the driver can't contact us,<br />we are fucked!
3124872 3126408 Unless...
3129418 3131159 - Pick up, pick up, pick up!<br />- Who are you calling?
3131170 3132411 Hi, it's Molly and Amy.
3132421 3133912 We're at Lido's Pizza<br />on Victory Boulevard.
3133922 3135959 We are stranded.<br />Please pick us up! We need...
3138510 3139921 It died.
3143766 3144766 We could hitchhike.
3144767 3146119 Are you aching to be murdered?
3146143 3148601 Well, I'm just throwin'<br />out suggestions here.
3161784 3162784 You girls need a ride?
3165954 3167140 - Shotgun.<br />- I'll take the front.
3167164 3169577 So cool. I'm just gonna...
3169583 3171165 Amy, what are you doing?
3171210 3173146 My legs are, like,<br />half an inch longer than yours.
3173170 3174627 Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.
3174630 3175711 What are you...
3175714 3177580 If you could just let me go...
3177591 3179048 You're embarrassing me.
3179093 3181710 Thank you so much, Miss Fine.<br />You totally saved us.
3181762 3184550 Please. You two saved me<br />from rewatching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>
3184598 3186965 I've seen it, like, 50 times.
3187017 3189725 Okay, wait. So, what is<br />this address I'm taking you to?
3189770 3191807 It's, uh, Nick Howland's aunt's house.
3191855 3194393 It's a party, technically.
3194441 3195602 You two want me to drive you
3195651 3197483 to an unsupervised house party?
3197528 3199064 W-Well...
3199113 3200945 Good. I'm glad you guys<br />are having some fun
3200989 3202230 before graduation. Ugh.
3203951 3206364 - Really?<br />- Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes.
3206412 3208139 I don't want you guys to make<br />the same mistake I did.
3208163 3209324 What do you mean?
3209373 3211330 I spent the majority of my 20s
3211375 3212707 overcompensating for the fact
3212751 3214208 that I never had fun in high school.
3214253 3215835 And, you know, the pendulum then swung
3215879 3217336 in a completely different direction.
3217381 3218667 I mean, I went crazy.
3218716 3221129 I had some really<br />dark moments there in my 20s.
3221135 3223252 Like, some really dark moments.
3224138 3227506 Like, It was bad.<br />You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?
3227558 3230392 Not a single Jamba Juice,<br />like, every Jamba Juice.
3230394 3231885 That came down from corporate.
3231937 3233473 Do you know how many Jamba Juices
3233522 3234522 there are in this country?
3234523 3236014 Like, a bajillion.
3236066 3238183 It's a national chain.<br />It's a sensation.
3238235 3240773 I cannot have another<br />Mango-A-Go-Go ever again.
3240821 3242733 But, look, I don't want that for you.
3242781 3244272 Okay? You still have a chance.
3244324 3245860 I want you two to go to this party,
3245909 3247116 and I want you to have fun
3247161 3249369 because tonight is your night.
3249413 3250413 - Yes!<br />- Yes.
3250414 3251372 Okay.
3251373 3252409 - Yes.<br />- Yes.
3252458 3254916 So, what are you two wearing?
3254960 3257168 We were thinking, uh...
3258046 3260914 Well, just this look.
3260966 3262798 You do know you guys are matching, right?
3262843 3266177 We added this embellishment here.
3266221 3267962 Well, lucky for you two,
3268015 3269677 I'm a single woman living in Los Angeles,
3269725 3271967 so I got a lot of shit in this car.
3271977 3274139 Why don't y'all go through<br />some of those bags?
3274188 3275724 I'm sorry.<br />We can touch your clothes?
3275773 3277625 Yes, please.<br />Please touch my clothes.
3277649 3279609 - Please get a change of clothes on.<br />- This night.
3284615 3285856 Whew!
3286992 3288699 - Um... Oh...<br />- Um...
3288744 3291737 Mmm...
3291789 3292950 - I have no breath.<br />- What?
3292998 3294705 - Excuse me?<br />- Sorry, what, my friend?
3294750 3296603 I have nowhere to go with this.<br />It's too perfect.
3296627 3297959 You are literally glowing.
3298003 3299272 You've hit the level of perfection,
3299296 3301333 - and now I'm just...<br />- Be still, my heart.
3301381 3302609 You've just come out of the water.
3302633 3304861 You're fresh from the water.<br />You're a mermaid. You're here.
3304885 3306842 How are you so fucking shiny?
3306887 3308782 Can you fetch me an inhaler?<br />'Cause I can't breathe, Amy.
3308806 3311594 - Um, my eyes. Ow, ow!<br />- I'm physically unable...
3311642 3313383 My eyes hurt so bad from your beauty.
3313435 3314892 Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.
3314937 3317099 - There's a party to get to.<br />- Oh, sorry.
3317147 3319184 All right.
3319233 3320974 I will see you two inside,<br />all right?
3320984 3322395 Just kidding.<br />Imagine if I did, though.
3322402 3323483 She's kidding.
3323487 3325695 Imagine if I just went in.<br />That'd be weird, right?
3327533 3329775 - Anyway, see y'all later.<br />- Okay.
3333372 3334488 Okay.
3341046 3342406 - Love you.<br />- Love you.

3448278 3449964 I'll take care of you.<br />You guys are the best.
3449988 3451445 You guys honestly freak me out...
3452407 3453943 but I'm gonna miss you guys.
3454034 3455195 Okay? It's all love.
3456036 3459529 Class of '19 for-fuckin'- ever! Whoo!
3461541 3462873 Um...
3462876 3466085 - Ryan. Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />- Where? Where?
3466088 3468125 Oh, god. She's glowing.
3468173 3469755 Go get her. Hug me.
3471551 3472792 - Okay. Get her.<br />- Whew! Okay.
3472803 3474169 Get her. Flick the bean.
3475013 3476845 Molly. Here's to you, gorgeous.
3476848 3478885 - Thank you.<br />- Of course, of course.
3478976 3480558 Tanner, where's the rubbing alcohol?
3480644 3481885 There's nothing strong enough.
3481895 3483181 - No!<br />- Yep.
3483230 3484721 - No.<br />- I'm here.
3484815 3485773 How?
3485774 3487436 I'm gonna go downstairs.

3506962 3508169 Thanks.
3508964 3510580 I've always wanted you to come out.
3510674 3512210 Oh, I, I am out.
3513343 3515505 I came out<br />in the tenth grade.
3515512 3518846 No. I meant, like, come out
3518849 3520511 and hang out on the weekend.
3522352 3524639 Oh. Right. "Hang out," yeah.
3524646 3527059 That's, that's what I meant also.
3527107 3528643 You need to have a little bit of fun
3528650 3530016 before you go to Africa.
3530027 3531438 You remembered I'm going to Africa?
3531528 3534020 Of course. Aren't you gonna go<br />to Uganda or something?
3534114 3535446 Botswana.
3535449 3537657 - They'd kill me in Uganda.<br />- Why?
3537659 3540493 Because that country's not<br />really a fan of gay people.
3540495 3542236 Oh, shit. That's crazy.
3542289 3544201 Would you be afraid<br />to go to Uganda...

3549629 3551469 Do you want to go do karaoke<br />in the guest room?
3551506 3553213 - I love that girl.<br />- Yeah.
3553258 3554485 - Come on, let's go.<br />- Okay.
3560015 3561551 Uh, elbows.
3561600 3563262 Can we get a re-rack, please?
3563310 3565267 Holy shit.
3565312 3566769 Wait, Molly's here?
3566772 3569640 What a fucking compliment<br />to get Molly to roll.
3569691 3571273 Dude, are you actually here right now?
3571359 3572691 Is this some mirage?
3572736 3574352 Am I fucking losing my mind?
3574404 3576066 Or did I actually get president Molly
3576114 3577400 to come out on a weekend?
3577449 3579406 It's a purely ceremonial visit.
3579493 3582236 Okay, okay.<br />Hey, why don't you sit here?
3582287 3585451 Yeah, right next to me.<br />Please, sit here and let's go.
3585499 3586851 I've been fucking waiting for this
3586875 3588662 since, like, seventh grade.
3588668 3590159 - Please? It's for you.<br />- Oh.

4088418 4089454 Molly...
4089502 4092231 Things are going so well over here.<br />Like, really, really, really well.
4092255 4093917 I'm being so mean to him,<br />but it's working.
4093923 4095985 We talked about Harry Potter.<br />He knows I'm a Slytherin.
4096009 4097945 - He seems to like it.<br />- I think we should go home.
4097969 4100086 Wait, what? No.<br />Ju-just dry off.
4100138 4102095 No, I think we need to leave.<br />Come on, let's go.
4102098 4104636 No, are you nuts?<br />No, he... Nick is fully...
4104642 4106383 - No.<br />- He's fully flirting with me.
4106436 4107677 This actually might happen.
4107729 4109061 Listen to me,<br />this actually might happen.
4109063 4111125 No, no, Molly, please, I'm asking you.<br />Let's just go.
4111149 4112435 Ame, just go find Ryan.<br />It'll be great.
4112442 4113649 Malala!
4115153 4116153 Amy, no.
4118573 4120064 - Are you kidding?<br />- No, I'm...
4120116 4122199 I've done whatever you wanted all night.
4122243 4124075 And I'm calling Malala, so come with me.
4124120 4127080 No, I'm not leaving just because<br />you're doing the thing that you always do.
4128833 4130324 What is that supposed to mean?
4130376 4133540 Just, you... you talk a big game
4133588 4135524 and then you give up<br />just when things get uncomfortable.
4135548 4136709 Like, you jumped in the pool,
4136716 4138503 and now you're sad<br />that you're wet? Like...
4138551 4140588 That's bullshit, Moll.<br />That's bullshit.
4140637 4143073 If I didn't drag you to do things, Amy,<br />you just wouldn't do them.
4143097 4144633 You don't drag me,
4144682 4147641 you force me to do whatever you wanna do.
4147685 4148892 What does that even mean?
4148936 4152179 You decide what we do and when we do it,
4152231 4153792 and that we always have<br />to do it together all the time.
4153816 4155023 Yeah, I have to decide
4155068 4156809 because you literally decide nothing.
4156819 4158797 Like, I do all the heavy lifting<br />in our friendship.
4158821 4161279 - You never take charge.<br />- I take charge all the time!
4161324 4164408 You never take charge.<br />I always have to push you.
4164452 4165988 Without me, you wouldn't do anything.
4165995 4167987 I'm going to Africa without you.
4168039 4169621 Yeah, I encouraged your summer abroad.
4169666 4171623 I'm not going for the summer.
4172418 4174125 I'm going for the entire year.
4177048 4178048 What?
4180468 4181800 I'm taking a gap year.
4182637 4184424 I deferred Columbia until next fall.
4185515 4187677 - When did you decide that?<br />- When I applied.
4189686 4192303 In January?<br />You've been lying to me since January?
4192355 4193749 Yeah, because I knew if I told you,
4193773 4195389 you'd bully me into staying.
4195441 4197683 So, all our schedules are<br />gonna be off now.
4197735 4199101 We're not gonna graduate together,
4199153 4200964 we're not gonna go<br />on a post-college trip together,
4200988 4203196 We're not gonna move to DC together?<br />Our whole plan...
4203241 4205858 That was your plan!<br />That was never my plan.
4205910 4207867 - It's always your plan, Moll.<br />- I can't believe you.
4207870 4209710 You think that going to Africa makes<br />you tough,
4209747 4212114 and you weren't even fucking brave enough<br />to tell me about it!
4212125 4213661 You're a fucking coward, Amy!
4213710 4214951 You're selfish and mean!
4215002 4216083 You're a bad friend!
4216087 4217828 You're a fucking bad friend...
4267054 4268054 What the fuck?
4270433 4271890 I locked that.
4276606 4278063 Well, I guess you didn't.
4279108 4281771 What's wrong with you?<br />Fight with your wife?
4281861 4285320 Can you please just leave me alone?
4285406 4286817 Why are you even at a party?
4286908 4288444 Shouldn't you be, like, marching
4288451 4290158 in some meaningless protest somewhere
4290161 4293029 or, I don't know,<br />in your bed doing homework?
4293039 4294246 You don't even know me.
4294332 4295539 Pretty sure I do.
4295541 4297954 No. You're just one of those people
4297960 4299246 who claims they're honest
4299253 4300915 or calling people on their shit
4300922 4302504 when you're really just mean.
4305426 4306667 Wow.
4308179 4309636 Wow, I take it back.
4314143 4316851 You are a badass...
4317605 4319392 who takes no prisoners...
4321234 4324727 and cries in the bathroom at parties.
4330368 4331734 Why are you so cruel?
4333246 4335112 I just don't like meek people.
4336624 4337740 And you...
4338793 4341877 you're like Molly's little sidekick bitch.
4341921 4343332 Well, you're just a basic hot girl
4343339 4345001 who's gonna peak in high school.
4374954 4376320 When did you get here?
4377415 4378781 A while ago.
4378833 4382497 See Amy? She fucking freaked out at me.<br />I don't know what's wrong with her.
4382545 4385379 Do people really think<br />I had sex with a prostitute?
4388134 4389250 You didn't?
4389302 4390302 No.
4391220 4392552 Of course not. I...
4394515 4396256 I haven't slept with anybody.
4400146 4402809 No one in this entire school<br />knows me at all.
4405818 4409732 - Except Gigi.<br />- I'm a golden starfish!
4411866 4414108 Gigi, the girl who jumped off your boat
4414160 4416618 and gave you a prison tat<br />while you were sleeping?
4416662 4417948 Oh, that wasn't about me.
4419290 4421828 She's a sad person, you know?
4421876 4423993 And yeah, she may be a little nuts but...
4426047 4427913 she's the most loyal person I've ever met.
4428799 4430461 I mean, she once tried to shiv our mailman
4430468 4432209 because she thought he laughed at me.
4433012 4435550 Turns out, he wasn't.<br />I mean, he wasn't laughing at me at all,
4435598 4438557 he was just looking<br />at a meme on his phone.
4438601 4439967 Plus, not everyone's lucky enough
4440019 4441760 to find someone like you and Amy.
4441812 4443144 I'm just doing my best,
4443189 4444305 so I can get out of here...
4445191 4447808 and find some people who are into<br />the same weird shit I'm into.
4449028 4450894 Not, like, sex stuff.<br />I mean, like, you know...
4452657 4454193 airplanes and musicals.
4454241 4455698 What?
4456744 4458406 I wanna design fucking airplanes.
4459205 4460616 Yeah. Get rich off that,
4460623 4462351 then use the cash<br />to produce some new musicals.
4462375 4464186 Enough with the revivals already.<br />It's total bullshit.
4464210 4467374 Audiences deserve<br />something original, I think.

5431051 5433008 - Well...<br />- Oh, Lingling.
5433803 5434839 - Um...<br />- No.
5434888 5436220 Please be good to my Amy.
5436264 5437505 All right. I gotta pack up.
5437557 5439117 Make her feel like she's not so lonely.
5439142 5440724 Make her feel good.
5440769 5442038 I gotta put that in the old suitcase.
5442062 5443473 Amy, make it stop.
5443521 5445763 Please don't put your face on the face.
5445815 5446815 Make it stop.
5446858 5448019 - Not the nose.<br />- On the head.
5448068 5449253 - On the neck.<br />- Make it stop.
5449277 5450438 Hey, Amy, there's...
5450487 5451568 Look who she's bringing.
5451613 5453650 - Okay.<br />- Lingling?
5453740 5456699 - No. No. No...<br />- Oh, let me get in there.
5461831 5465290 Uh... Amy, there's, uh,<br />someone here to see you.
5465293 5466374 - Hmm?<br />- Who?
5467379 5468415 What?
5469381 5471748 - Why is she here?<br />- Oh. Excuse me.
5472717 5473717 Amy!
5473760 5475752 Why is she here?
5487065 5489478 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
5489484 5491851 I figured I'd bring back your clothes.
5491903 5494691 Oh. Thanks so much.
5494739 5497482 I don't usually leave my underwear
5497492 5500485 in places that aren't my room.
5501371 5502828 Yeah, I figured.
5504124 5505160 So, um...
5506751 5507958 ho-how...
5508795 5510832 Are you okay?
5511673 5512673 Yeah, I'm fine.
5514592 5515924 Are you okay?
5515969 5517505 Yeah, I...
5518513 5521301 You know, prison kinda changes you.
5521349 5522840 - Hmm.<br />- But, uh...
5524686 5525802 I'm fine.
5525854 5527846 Sorry, I just really don't know
5527939 5529771 what I'm doing with all that stuff yet.
5529816 5534777 Well, for someone who has<br />no idea what they're doing...
5536906 5538568 you kinda know what you're doing.
5540368 5542826 That's...
5544039 5545039 Ah.
5545040 5546827 Um, that's cool.
5548293 5552253 So, how is your summer going?
5553381 5556920 I mean, what are you doing<br />for the summertime?
5559471 5561554 Think I'm gonna backpack around for a bit.
5562474 5563760 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
5563808 5565595 - Where?<br />- I don't know.
5565643 5568602 Honestly, anywhere I can find<br />a couch to crash on.
5568605 5571518 I just, you know, wanna see<br />some stuff before college.
5572317 5574149 That's really cool. Me, too.
5574194 5576186 That's why I'm taking a gap year.
5576237 5578980 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. Yeah.
5579783 5582696 All right, well, uh, have fun, nerd.
5591252 5594586 Um, well, if you<br />ever end up in Botswana,
5595632 5597669 you would have a couch to crash on.
5597717 5599333 Okay.
5600136 5603004 Well, technically, it won't be my couch,
5603056 5604992 'cause I'll be staying with a family,<br />but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.
5605016 5606132 Okay.
5615568 5617935 Yes! Yes!
5619072 5620563 Molly!
5620615 5623028 Amy, this thing drives like a cruise ship.
5623827 5625193 Well, it's yours now.
5626162 5628028 Take care of the old Volvo for me.
5628081 5629162 Oh, speaking of vulva,
5629249 5631366 remember when you missed Hope's,
5631376 5633176 and you just went<br />straight for that butt hole?
5633211 5635248 I said, I said once a day.
5635338 5637580 - Hey, I have to stock up...<br />- Once a day.
5637632 5639168 ...because you're gonna be on a flight
5639217 5641334 for, like, 28 hours.
5641344 5642505 So, I have to stock up.
5642512 5644003 It's not my fault.
5654607 5656418 Yeah, it feels weird<br />to be on this side of the car.
5656442 5659105 It's like everything's different.
5661281 5663489 Yeah, I can't believe<br />I'm not gonna see you tomorrow.
5663533 5666150 Call me on that weird<br />international flip phone, okay?
5666202 5667202 I will.
5668246 5669282 Okay.
5670123 5671330 - Bye. I love you.<br />- Bye.
5671374 5672660 Love you.
5674377 5676243 - Bye.<br />- Go make those tampons, girl.
5676254 5677540 I will. I...
5678548 5680210 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5687599 5689966 - Oh, gotta get that bag.<br />- Yep. Gotta...
5689976 5691968 It's a long trip.
5691978 5693469 Go get 'em.
5694689 5695725 What's a year?
