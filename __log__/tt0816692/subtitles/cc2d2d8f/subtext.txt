74908 77094 Well, my dad was a farmer.
78161 80722 Like everybody else back then.
82749 85018 Of course, he didn't start that way.
91216 93002 Computer says you're too tight.
93102 95946 - Nah, I got this.<br />- Crossing the Straights.
98265 100117 - Shutting it down, Cooper.<br />- No!
101518 104037 - Shutting it all down.<br />- No, I need power up!
108275 109418 Dad?
115866 118602 Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.
118702 121304 - I thought you were the ghost.<br />- No.
122873 124942 There are no such things<br />as ghosts, babe.
125042 127310 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128629 133583 Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little<br />too close to being one himself. Back to bed.
133717 135652 Were you dreaming about the crash?
136970 139364 Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.
166291 167893 The wheat had died.
168627 171062 The blight came and we had to burn it.
171380 174658 And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.
174758 177110 But... mostly we had dust.
179429 182124 I guess I can't describe it.<br />It was just constant.
182224 186203 Just that steady blow of dirt.
188188 191341 We wore... little strips of sheet...
191441 194219 sometimes over our nose and mouth...
194319 196922 so that we wouldn't breathe<br />so much of it.
198532 202211 Well, when we set the table,<br />we always set the plate upside-down.
202311 205555 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was upside-down.
210877 212996 Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!
213096 216825 Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,<br />Herbicide Resistance 101.
216925 218527 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
219970 221738 Not at the table, Murph.
222389 224324 Dad, can you fix this?
225809 228445 - What the heck did you do to my lander?<br />- Wasn't me.
228545 230589 Let me guess. It was your ghost?
230689 233091 It knocked it off.<br />It keeps knocking books off.
233191 235016 - No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.<br />- Hey.
235116 238372 - I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.<br />- Dad, tell her.
238472 240557 Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.
240657 243060 You said science was about admitting<br />what we don't know.
243260 247097 - She's got you there.<br />- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.
248623 249933 Coop.
252027 254896 All right, Murph,<br />you want to talk science?
255756 259076 Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.<br />No, you got to go further.
259176 262012 You got to record the facts, analyze,<br />get to the how and the why...
262112 265532 then present your conclusions. Deal?
266099 267617 - Deal.<br />- All right.
270353 272622 - Have a good day at school.<br />- Hold up.
272856 277344 Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.<br />Not grandparent.
279529 281464 Slow down, turbo!
282699 285994 - That's not a dust storm.<br />- Nelson's torching his whole crop.
286094 287137 Blight?
287237 290056 They're saying<br />it's the last harvest for okra.
290624 291892 Ever.
293610 296405 He should've planted corn<br />like the rest of us.
296505 299282 Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.<br />She's single.
299382 300951 What's that supposed to mean?
301051 304246 Repopulating the earth.<br />Start pulling your weight, young man.
304346 308408 Why don't you start<br />minding your own business, old man?
315607 317375 All right, Murph, give me second.
320695 322139 Third.
323615 325350 - Find a gear, dumb-ass.<br />- Grind it!
325450 326593 Shut it, Tom!
327869 330372 - What'd you do, Murph?<br />- She didn't do nothing.
330472 332974 - Blew a tire is all.<br />- Murphy's Law.
333708 334689 Shut up!
334789 337062 - Grab the spare, Tom.<br />- That is the spare.
339589 341191 Get the patch kit!
342384 345662 - How am I supposed to patch it out here?<br />- You got to figure it out.
345762 347822 I'm not always gonna be here<br />to help you.
356147 357966 What's going on, Murph?
358066 361344 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
361444 364798 - We didn't.<br />- Murphy's Law?
365657 369811 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad will happen.
369911 373356 What it means is<br />whatever can happen will happen.
373456 376101 And that sounded just fine with us.
380213 381856 Whoa!
382540 383733 Get in.
385010 386528 Get in, let's go.
387762 389990 What about the flat tire?
392851 394285 Yeah.
408158 412229 It's an Indian Air Force drone.<br />Solar cells could power an entire farm.
412329 413888 Take the wheel, Tom.
419252 420687 Go, go, go!
422172 423940 Keep that aimed right at it.
431965 434484 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
434851 435994 Right at it.
437695 438938 Stay on it.
440223 441507 Here we go.
444027 445336 Whoa.
450367 452052 Nice one, Tom.
458516 459893 Dad?
460210 463063 I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!
463421 466074 - Dad!<br />- Tom!
470553 472989 You told me to keep driving.
473723 478286 Well, I guess that answers the old<br />"If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.
481398 484334 - We lost it.<br />- No, we didn't.
496913 498681 Want to give it a whirl?
504587 506064 This way.
511344 512529 Go.
513430 516533 Let's lay her down right there<br />at the edge of the reservoir.
520729 522539 Nicely done.
525442 527385 How long you think it's been up there?
527485 530096 Delhi Mission Control<br />went down, same as ours...
530196 532132 - ...ten years ago.<br />- Heh.
532365 534384 So for ten years?
537245 539940 - Why did it come down so low?<br />- I don't know.
540040 543026 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
543126 545478 - What?<br />- Give me a large flatblade.
545795 548565 Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.
553820 555321 What are you gonna do with it?
556139 559409 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
560185 561619 like drive a combine.
562103 563705 Can't we just let it go?
565899 567667 It wasn't hurting anybody.
569235 573631 This thing needs to learn how to adapt,<br />Murph... like the rest of us.
578119 580231 How's this work? You guys come with?
580331 583833 I've got class. This one needs to wait.
585376 588238 - What did you do?<br />- They'll tell you about it in there.
588338 590573 - Am I gonna be mad?<br />- Not with me.
590673 593943 - Just please try not to.<br />- Hey. Relax.
595261 596696 I got this.
601050 603920 - Little late, Coop.<br />- Yeah, we had a flat.
604020 607665 And I guess you had to stop off<br />at the Asian fighter plane store.
607857 611511 No, actually, sir,<br />that's a surveillance drone.
611611 614464 With outstanding solar cells.<br />It's Indian.
614781 616216 Take a seat.
617242 618843 So...
619452 622138 we got Tom's scores back.
622580 624607 He's going to make an excellent farmer.
624707 628278 Yeah, he's got a knack for it.<br />What about college?
628378 632198 The university only takes a handful.<br />They don't have the resources to...
632298 634659 I still pay my taxes.
634759 636861 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
637262 639697 Well, it doesn't go to the university.
640381 645070 - Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.<br />- You're ruling my son out for college now?
645311 648915 - The kid's 15.<br />- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
649816 652085 What's your waistline? About what, 32?
652402 656139 - About a 33 inseam?<br />- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
656239 660760 It takes two numbers to measure your ass<br />but only one to measure my son's future?
661536 664481 Come on.<br />You're a well-educated man, Coop.
664581 666641 - And a trained pilot.<br />- And an engineer.
667041 672155 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need more engineers.
672255 676793 We didn't run out of television screens<br />and planes. We ran out of food.
676926 680413 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
680513 682991 - And Tom.<br />- Uneducated farmers.
683808 687796 We're a caretaker generation, Coop.<br />And things are getting better.
687896 691124 - Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...<br />- Are we done here, sir?
692317 693501 No.
694235 696504 Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
696738 699349 Murph is a great kid.<br />She's really bright.
699449 701768 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
701868 705313 She brought this in to show the students.<br />The section on the lunar landings.
705413 710443 Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.<br />She always loved the pictures.
710543 714322 It's an old federal textbook. We've<br />replaced them with the corrected versions.
714422 715532 Corrected?
715632 720061 Explaining how the Apollo missions<br />were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726476 728536 You don't believe we went to the moon?
729562 731631 It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
731731 734634 The Soviets bankrupted themselves<br />pouring resources...
734734 738304 - into rockets and other useless machines.<br />- "Useless machines."
738404 742559 If we don't want a repeat of the excess<br />and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
742659 746554 we need to teach our kids about this planet,<br />not tales of leaving it.
747288 751392 One of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRI.
751668 754871 If we had any of those left,<br />the doctors would've been able to find...
754971 758992 the cyst in my wife's brain<br />before she died instead of afterwards.
759092 762245 Then she'd have been the one<br />listening to this instead of me...
762345 765731 which would have been a good thing,<br />because she was always...
766015 767617 the calmer one.
768184 770770 I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.
771521 775258 But Murph got into a fistfight<br />with several of her classmates over this...
775358 779721 Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best<br />to bring you in and see what ideas...
779821 782590 you might have for dealing<br />with her behavior on the home front.
783700 786811 Yeah, you know what?<br />There's a game tomorrow night.
786911 789105 She's going through<br />a bit of a baseball phase.
789205 793518 Her favorite team is playing.<br />There's gonna be candy and soda and...
796504 798439 I think I'll take her to that.
803678 805229 How'd it go?
805847 807824 I got you suspended.
808141 809575 - What?<br />- Cooper.
811227 812462 This is Cooper. Go.
812562 815465 Coop, those combines you rebuilt<br />went haywire.
815565 817834 Just reset the controllers.
818067 820795 I did that.<br />Now you should come take a look.
840423 843593 One by one they've been peeling off<br />the fields and heading over.
843693 845528 Something's interfering<br />with the compass.
846929 849407 Magnetism or some such.
892425 896913 Nothing special about which book.<br />I've been working on it, like you said.
897563 900466 - I counted the spaces.<br />- Why?
902110 904495 In case the ghost<br />is trying to communicate.
904987 906831 I'm trying Morse.
907115 908599 Morse?
908699 910084 Yeah.
910201 912895 - Dots and dashes, used...<br />- I know what Morse code is, Murph.
912995 916215 I just don't think your bookshelf's<br />trying to talk to you.
927510 931989 Had to reset every compass clock and GPS<br />to offset for the anomaly.
932181 934825 - Which is?<br />- I don't know.
936519 938713 If the house was built<br />on magnetic ore...
938813 941999 we'd have seen this the first time<br />we switched on the tractor.
944569 947838 I hear your meeting at the school<br />didn't go so well.
948364 950174 Heh. You heard?
951033 953970 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
955538 959441 Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
960751 962445 When I was a kid...
962545 966774 it felt like they made something new<br />every day. Some...
967049 970444 gadget or idea.<br />Like every day was Christmas.
970803 975992 But six billion people...<br />just try to imagine that.
976893 979996 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
983274 985693 This world isn't so bad.
987445 991289 And Tom will do just fine.<br />You're the one who doesn't belong.
991389 994402 Born 40 years too late,<br />or 40 years too early.
995203 998005 My daughter knew it, God bless her.
998581 1001475 And your kids know it. Especially Murph.
1001709 1005196 Well, we used to look up in the sky<br />and wonder...
1005296 1007973 at our place in the stars.
1010092 1014572 Now we just look down and worry<br />about our place in the dirt.
1014972 1017908 Cooper, you were good at something...
1018142 1020745 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1021437 1023072 I'm sorry.
1024582 1028711 You didn't expect this dirt<br />that was giving you this food...
1028945 1032131 to turn on you like that<br />and destroy you.
1032432 1036761 In April... I believe I'm right...<br />Fifteenth of April, I think.
1037119 1041566 This happened about 1:30 when that thing...<br />came off the top of that canyon.
1043209 1047530 In my day, we had real ballplayers.<br />Who are these bums?
1047630 1052443 In my day, people were too busy<br />fighting over food to even play baseball.
1052635 1057382 Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.<br />I want a hot dog.
1057482 1060109 School says you're gonna follow<br />in my footsteps.
1060560 1062161 I think that's great.
1062353 1065748 - You think that's great?<br />- You hate farming, Dad.
1066440 1068134 Grandpa said.
1068234 1069752 Grandpa said?
1070069 1072680 Listen, all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1072780 1074548 I like what you do.
1075157 1076759 I like our farm.
1077326 1079020 You're gonna be great at it.
1091999 1093801 Let's get out of here.
1100558 1102660 All right, it's a doozy.
1103269 1105204 All right, gang, let's mask up.
1108441 1110543 - Tom? Murph? Check?<br />- Yeah.
1163996 1166682 Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?
1171003 1172188 Murph?
1193484 1194877 The ghost.
1196028 1197755 Grab your pillow.
1198047 1200382 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1255112 1256981 It's not a ghost.
1261903 1263821 It's gravity.
1265473 1267825 I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.
1268017 1272288 You want to clean that up<br />when you've finished praying to it?
1297546 1299899 It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.
1300299 1302459 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1306722 1308157 Coordinates.
1310643 1313245 Nope.
1314605 1315873 Here we go.
1317358 1318834 Thirty-three.
1321695 1322838 That's it.
1324198 1325799 I can't miss this!
1326033 1329303 Grandpa will be back<br />in a couple hours, Murph.
1329995 1332765 But you don't know<br />what you're gonna find.
1333666 1335300 And that...
1336085 1338270 is why I can't take you.
1344260 1345486 Murph?
1347471 1351075 Grandpa will be home in a while.<br />Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
1357147 1358499 Jesus.
1359400 1361385 - What are you doing?<br />- Heh-heh.
1361485 1363712 Oh, you think this is funny?
1363946 1366382 You wouldn't be here<br />if it wasn't for me.
1368117 1370219 Make yourself useful.
1433474 1435208 Hey, Murph?
1436435 1437978 Murph.
1440981 1443417 I think this is the end of the road.
1446320 1448464 Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
1449531 1450883 That's my girl.
1478519 1479837 Step away!
1479937 1483090 Don't shoot! I'm not armed.<br />My daughter's in the car.
1488570 1490923 Don't be afraid.
1503544 1505729 How did you find this place?
1506338 1507773 Where's my daughter?
1507965 1511952 You had the coordinates for this facility<br />marked on your map. Where did you get them?
1512052 1513254 Where's my daughter?
1513354 1516573 Don't make me take you down again.<br />Sit down!
1516807 1519084 Oh, you still think<br />you're a Marine, pal?
1519184 1521870 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522062 1527092 - And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.<br />- Where did you find those coordinates?
1527192 1529845 But you don't look much<br />like a lawnmower.
1529945 1532848 Think I'll turn you<br />into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532948 1534258 No, you won't.
1535784 1537803 TARS, back down, please.
1539204 1542432 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military security.
1542791 1546695 They're old, and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1546795 1548864 It's what the government could spare.
1550466 1551733 Who are you?
1552092 1553494 Dr. Brand.
1553594 1556071 I knew a Dr. Brand once.<br />He was a professor.
1556346 1557948 What makes you think I'm not?
1558307 1560876 Wasn't near as cute, either.
1560976 1563579 Please, Dr. Brand.<br />I don't have any idea what this is.
1564313 1566882 Now I'm scared for my daughter<br />and want her by my side.
1566982 1569543 You give me that,<br />I'll tell you anything you want to know.
1572821 1575924 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room, please.
1577359 1580137 Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.
1580621 1582523 Must have a very smart mother.
1582623 1585109 It's pretty clear<br />you don't want any visitors.
1585209 1589271 So why don't you just let us back up from<br />your fence and we'll be on our way?
1589463 1592107 - It's not that simple.<br />- Well, sure, it is.
1592341 1596111 I don't know anything about you.<br />I don't know anything about this place.
1596887 1598155 Yes, you do.
1603769 1604953 Dad!
1607523 1608665 Hello, Cooper.
1610025 1611168 Professor Brand.
1612536 1615264 Explain to me<br />how you found this facility.
1615364 1618726 Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled<br />upon it. We were on a salvage run...
1618826 1621603 You're sitting in the best-kept secret<br />in the world.
1621703 1625307 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1625541 1629820 Cooper, please.<br />Cooperate with these people.
1629920 1631230 Look.
1632047 1633815 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634049 1638871 We learned these coordinates<br />from an anomaly.
1638971 1640372 What sort of anomaly?
1640472 1643834 I hesitate to term it supernatural,<br />but it definitely wasn't scientific.
1643934 1647921 You're going to have to be specific,<br />Mr. Cooper. Right now.
1648021 1649373 It was gravity.
1654247 1657222 What sort of gravitational anomaly?<br />Where was this?
1657322 1660684 Now, I'm real happy that you're excited<br />about gravity, bud...
1660784 1663663 but you're not getting any answers<br />from us until I get assurances.
1663763 1665555 - Assurances?<br />- Yeah.
1666290 1669818 Like, that we're getting out of here.<br />And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
1672296 1675908 - Don't you know who we are, Coop?<br />- No, professor, I don't.
1676008 1678110 You know my father, Professor Brand.
1678635 1680028 We're NASA.
1681722 1684032 - NASA?<br />- NASA.
1684266 1686159 The same NASA you flew for.
1697112 1698847 I heard they shut you down, sir...
1698947 1703018 for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere onto starving people.
1703118 1705521 When they realized<br />that killing other people was...
1705621 1708524 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1708624 1710692 - In secret.<br />- Why secret?
1710792 1714788 Because public opinion wouldn't allow<br />spending on space exploration.
1714888 1717482 Not while you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718800 1720068 Blight.
1720427 1724664 Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.
1725015 1726783 Now there's just corn.
1727017 1729044 And we're growing more<br />than we ever have.
1729144 1733415 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
1733899 1736501 the corn will die.
1737152 1738295 Soon.
1743492 1747179 We'll find a way, professor.<br />We always have.
1747829 1751933 Driven by the unshakable faith<br />the Earth is ours.
1752334 1756438 Not just ours, no. But it is our home.
1757673 1762953 Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.<br />We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763053 1768458 Blight does. And as it thrives,<br />our air gets less and less oxygen.
1768558 1772087 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1772187 1774456 And your daughter's generation...
1775924 1778343 will be the last to survive on Earth.
1778443 1782130 Murph is feeling tired. I was wondering<br />if she could take a nap in my office.
1782531 1784132 Yeah. Thank you.
1786827 1788269 Alright...
1788870 1792474 now you need to tell me<br />what your plan is to save the world.
1793041 1796645 We're not meant to save the world.<br />We're meant to leave it.
1802384 1803527 Rangers.
1803719 1808782 The last components of our one versatile ship<br />in orbit, the Endurance.
1808974 1810700 Our final expedition.
1811393 1814454 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1814980 1816373 The Lazarus missions.
1816606 1819668 - Oh, that sounds cheerful.<br />- Lazarus came back from the dead.
1819901 1822003 Sure, but he had to die<br />in the first place.
1822529 1825307 There's not a planet in our solar system<br />that could sustain life...
1825407 1827976 and the nearest star's<br />over a thousand years away.
1828076 1830846 That doesn't even qualify as futile.
1832414 1833849 Where'd you send them?
1834166 1835651 Cooper...
1835751 1840614 I can't tell you anymore<br />unless you agree to pilot this craft.
1840714 1844109 - You're the best pilot we ever had.<br />- I barely left the stratosphere.
1844301 1846528 This team never left the simulator.
1846762 1850624 We need a pilot, and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1850724 1852325 Without even knowing it?
1853268 1857589 An hour ago, you didn't even know<br />I was alive. You were going anyway.
1857689 1861418 We had no choice.<br />But something sent you here.
1861651 1864463 - They chose you.<br />- Who's "they"?
1872329 1874347 How long would I be gone?
1874831 1878051 Hard to know. Years?
1878460 1882731 - I've got kids, professor.<br />- Get out there and save them.
1886009 1887452 Who's "they"?
1887552 1891581 We started detecting gravitational<br />anomalies almost 50 years ago.
1891681 1895377 Mostly small distortions to our instruments<br />in the upper atmosphere.
1895477 1898705 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1899272 1901774 Yeah, over the Straights.
1902275 1905387 My crash.<br />Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
1905487 1906796 Exactly.
1907531 1912519 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this:
1912619 1914688 Out near Saturn...
1914788 1916973 a disturbance of space-time.
1919000 1922229 - Is that a Wormhole?<br />- It appeared 48 years ago.
1922587 1926775 - And it leads where?<br />- Another galaxy.
1928427 1930746 A wormhole's not<br />a naturally occurring phenomenon.
1930846 1932364 Someone placed it there.
1933056 1934658 "They"?
1935058 1939246 And whoever they are,<br />they appear to be looking out for us.
1939604 1944343 That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.<br />It came along right as we needed it.
1944443 1947429 They've put potentially habitable worlds<br />right within our reach.
1947529 1949514 Twelve, in fact,<br />from our initial probes.
1949614 1952059 You sent probes into that?
1952159 1955562 We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
1956496 1958398 The Lazarus missions.
1958498 1962310 Twelve possible worlds,<br />twelve Ranger launches carrying...
1962669 1968183 the bravest humans ever to live...<br />led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1968283 1971453 Each person's landing pod<br />had enough life support for two years.
1971553 1973580 But they could use hibernation<br />to stretch that...
1973680 1976958 making observations on organics<br />over a decade or more.
1977058 1980996 Their mission was to assess their world,<br />and if it showed potential...
1981229 1985717 then they could send out a signal,<br />bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
1985817 1987961 And what if the world<br />didn't show promise?
1988487 1990005 Hence the bravery.
1990697 1993308 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1993408 1994834 No.
1995410 1998271 Data transmission back through<br />the Wormhole is rudimentary.
1998371 2003485 Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us<br />some clue as to which worlds have potential.
2003585 2005478 And one system shows promise.
2005712 2008656 One. That's a bit<br />of a long shot, isn't it?
2009090 2012027 One system with three potential worlds?
2012344 2014329 No long shot.
2016097 2017324 Okay.
2017933 2020568 So if we find a home...
2022938 2026499 - ...then what?<br />- That's the long shot.
2026733 2030045 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2030445 2033506 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
2045126 2048146 This entire facility's a centrifuge.
2048380 2050982 Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
2051216 2055287 - Both. Plan A.<br />- How do you get it off the ground?
2055387 2059291 The first gravitational anomalies<br />changed everything.
2059391 2063928 Suddenly we knew<br />that harnessing gravity was real.
2064062 2068833 So I started working on a theory<br />and we started building this station.
2069109 2071494 But you haven't solved it yet.
2072279 2073922 That's why there's Plan B.
2074322 2079102 The problem is gravity. How to get<br />a viable amount of human life off the planet.
2079202 2080595 This is one way.
2080829 2083431 Plan B: A population bomb.
2083665 2088520 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs<br />weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2089129 2090697 How would you raise them?
2090797 2093325 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093425 2097404 After that, with surrogacy,<br />the growth becomes exponential.
2098013 2101374 Within 30 years,<br />we could have a colony of hundreds.
2101474 2104953 The real difficulty with colonization<br />is genetic diversity.
2105478 2107088 This takes care of that.
2107188 2109749 But what about the people here?<br />You just...
2110025 2113536 You give up on them? My kids?
2113778 2117215 That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
2119367 2122312 - How far have you got?<br />- Almost there.
2122412 2124931 You're asking me to hang everything...
2125874 2127308 on an almost.
2127751 2130145 I'm asking you to trust me.
2133131 2134899 Find us a new home.
2135550 2137652 And by the time you return...
2138136 2140905 I will have solved<br />the problem of gravity.
2141765 2143450 I give you my word.
2155987 2157589 Go away!
2168166 2169484 Murph.
2169584 2172687 Go! If you're leaving, just go.
2175382 2178418 This world was never enough<br />for you, was it, Coop?
2179052 2183306 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2183765 2185700 And it excites me? Heh.
2186309 2188837 No, that does not make it wrong.
2188937 2193666 It might. Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194317 2196720 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2196820 2199205 And the foundation's solid.
2202075 2207180 We farmers, we sit here every year<br />when the rains fail and we say:
2207372 2208723 "Next year."
2209290 2213061 Well, next year ain't gonna save us,<br />nor the one after that.
2213295 2218024 This world's a treasure, Donald,<br />but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.
2222637 2226533 Mankind was born on Earth,<br />it was never meant to die here.
2229561 2232839 Tom will be all right, but you got<br />to make things right with Murph.
2232939 2234582 I will.
2234941 2238211 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2248747 2250849 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2253251 2255445 I need to fix this before I go.
2255545 2258523 Then I'll keep it broken<br />so you have to stay.
2260008 2265113 After you kids came along, your mom said<br />something to me I never quite understood.
2265388 2267515 She said, "Now...
2268892 2273496 we're just here<br />to be memories for our kids."
2278526 2281129 And I think that now I understand<br />what she meant.
2284783 2288636 Once you're a parent,<br />you're the ghost of your children's future.
2290163 2292432 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2298797 2300398 That's right, Murph.
2303510 2305344 Murph, look at me.
2307889 2310491 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312185 2314487 I need to exist.
2315814 2317832 They chose me.
2318441 2322503 Murph, they chose me. You saw.<br />You're the one who led me to them.
2325031 2327634 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330745 2332805 I figured out the message.
2333122 2336401 - One word. Know what it is?<br />- Murph.
2336501 2337936 "Stay."
2338211 2341189 - It says, "Stay," Dad.<br />- Murph.
2342048 2343575 You don't believe me.
2343675 2346536 Look at the books! Look at this.<br />It says, "Stay."
2346636 2349697 Why...? You're not listening!<br />It says, "Stay!"
2349931 2353668 - No, I'm coming back.<br />- When?
2366281 2369017 One for you, one for me.
2369117 2372387 When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...
2372620 2375964 traveling near the speed of light, or...
2376165 2378651 near a black hole...
2378751 2383598 time's gonna change for me.<br />It's gonna run more slowly.
2384883 2387276 When we get back...
2387802 2389287 we're gonna compare.
2389387 2392315 - Time will run differently for us?<br />- Yeah.
2393099 2397870 By the time I get back,<br />we might even be the same age, you and me.
2398146 2401481 "What?" Imagine that!
2405028 2406262 Aw, Murph...
2406362 2409390 You have no idea when you're coming back.
2410783 2412929 No idea at all!
2415413 2417607 Murph, don't...<br />Don't make me leave like this.
2417707 2419308 Come on, Murph!
2419709 2422445 Don't make me leave like this, Murph!
2429636 2430778 Hey...
2431220 2435208 I love you. Forever. You hear me?
2435308 2438819 I love you forever, and I'm coming back.
2444317 2445952 I'm coming back.
2463878 2466447 - How'd it go?<br />- Fine.
2466798 2468357 Just fine.
2474722 2475948 I love you, Tom.
2476391 2478585 - Travel safe?<br />- Yeah.
2478685 2481004 You look after our place<br />for me, all right?
2481104 2482830 All right?
2487435 2491113 - Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?<br />- You mean your truck?
2492115 2494041 I'll make sure they bring it back.
2495868 2497962 Look after my kids, Donald!
2510133 2513861 Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...
2514829 2516581 - Dad!<br />- ...nine...
2516681 2518032 Dad!
2518758 2520402 ...eight...
2521135 2523738 - seven...<br />- Dad!
2523971 2525314 ...six...
2526490 2529210 five, main engine start, four...
2530645 2531912 three...
2532480 2533706 two...
2534523 2536709 one. Booster ignition and...
2545877 2548437 All engines look good.<br />Beginning roll program.
2552633 2555570 Prepare for stage one separation.
2555803 2556946 Stage one.
2562810 2564745 There is Mach 1.
2565605 2569417 Everybody good?<br />Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
2571194 2574589 They gave him a humor setting<br />so he'd fit in better with his unit.
2574822 2576557 He thinks it relaxes us.
2576657 2579552 A giant sarcastic robot.
2580328 2581813 What a great idea!
2581913 2584691 I have a cue light I can use<br />when I'm joking if you like.
2584791 2585900 That'd probably help.
2586000 2590021 You can use it to find your way back<br />to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.
2591005 2594075 - What's your humor setting, TARS?<br />- That's 100 percent.
2594175 2596068 Let's bring it on down to 75, please.
2596302 2598237 Stage two separation.
2608815 2611175 All feeds going manual.
2611275 2613193 Going manual.
2614987 2617223 Deactivate probe heater one,<br />two and three.
2617323 2618466 Check.
2623955 2626974 - Taking control.<br />- This is handover to you.
2630711 2633105 - A.D.F. check.<br />- Over.
2633339 2637076 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one, two, three.
2637176 2640613 - One hundred percent.<br />- Ex-mites.
2649480 2654293 It's hard leaving everything.<br />My kids. Your father.
2654819 2657263 We're going to be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2657363 2660508 - We should learn to talk.<br />- And when not to.
2662702 2664312 Just being honest.
2664412 2666847 I don't think you need to be that honest.
2667165 2669650 Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
2669750 2672445 - Ninety percent.<br />- Ninety percent?
2672545 2675243 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic,
2675343 2678409 nor the safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2678509 2680069 Okay.
2680428 2683155 Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.
2686767 2690079 We are coming up on the Endurance.<br />Twelve minutes out.
2707079 2709181 Okay. Taking control.
2712543 2715521 Approaching module port, 500 meters.
2728434 2729660 It's all you, Doyle.
2748120 2750681 Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.
2755753 2758406 - I feel good.<br />- Take us home.
2766138 2768441 - Lock.<br />- Target locked.
2768541 2770543 - Well done.<br />- Okay, helmets on.
2770643 2771786 Good job.
2805136 2808656 Door's not charging. Never mind.
2831329 2833139 Cooper, you should have control.
2833372 2834974 Control here.
2836292 2839019 Communication with ring module active.
2845384 2847027 Oh, wow.
2852725 2853993 That's initiate.
2861442 2864044 - Are we ready to spin?<br />- Just a sec.
2875373 2877808 - Hello, CASE.<br />- Hello, TARS.
2878667 2880686 All right, we're all set.
2881045 2882646 All right, let's do it.
2900856 2902458 Heh.
2911700 2913093 Thirty percent of spin.
2919917 2921352 One G.
2922002 2924104 How's gravity treating you back there?
2924338 2926006 Well.
2928676 2930536 Romilly? Hey, you okay?
2930636 2931746 - Yeah.<br />- You all right?
2931846 2934031 Yeah, I just need a minute.
2934348 2937640 I think we have some Dramamine<br />in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that
2937740 2939600 or maybe in the cryo-beds.<br />I'll just be a sec.
2939700 2941455 - Hey, Brand?<br />- Yeah?
2941689 2943316 - Bring a lot.<br />- Heh-heh-heh.
2951991 2954969 Amelia, be safe.
2955202 2958773 - Give my regards to Dr. Mann.<br />- I will, Dad.
2958873 2964395 It looks good for your trajectory.<br />We've calculated two years to Saturn.
2964845 2966647 That's a lot of Dramamine.
2967256 2969817 Look after my family,<br />will you, please, sir?
2970259 2973353 We'll be waiting for you<br />when you get back.
2973554 2977491 A little older, a little wiser,<br />but happy to see you.
2980227 2983664 Do not go gentle into that good night
2984031 2988377 Old age should burn<br />and rave at close of day
2989445 2994508 Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light
2995284 2999179 Though wise men at their end<br />Know dark is right
2999413 3002391 Because their words had forked<br />No lightning they
3002708 3006353 Do not go gentle into that good night
3006921 3011558 Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light
3027858 3029627 - You good?<br />- Yeah.
3030444 3032046 Okay, thank you, sir.
3035449 3037084 Here. Pills.
3039537 3041255 So alone.
3041455 3043482 We have each other.<br />Dr. Mann had it worse.
3043582 3045025 No, I mean them.
3046418 3049813 It's a perfect planet,<br />and we won't find another one like her.
3050297 3053651 No, it's not like looking<br />for a new condo.
3054677 3056945 The human race is going to be...
3057146 3058456 adrift...
3058556 3062159 desperate for a rock it can cling to<br />while it catches its breath.
3062643 3064578 We need to find that rock.
3064812 3069667 And our three prospects are at the edge<br />of what might sustain human life.
3070067 3072595 Laura Miller's planet is first.
3072695 3074922 - Laura started our biology program.<br />- COOPER:
3079827 3083097 - Wolf Edmunds is here.<br />- Tell me about Edmunds.
3083831 3086884 Oh... Wolf's a particle physicist.
3088877 3091313 None of them had families?
3092256 3095201 No. No attachments. My father insisted.
3095301 3098913 They all knew the odds against<br />ever seeing another human being again.
3099013 3101040 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3101140 3103125 - How about Mann?<br />- Dr. Mann?
3103225 3105211 He's remarkable. He's the best of us.
3105311 3109757 He inspired 11 people to follow him<br />on the loneliest journey in human history.
3109857 3111509 Scientists, explorers.
3111609 3115796 That's what I love.<br />You know, out there we face great odds.
3116196 3117915 Death, but...
3119366 3120801 not evil.
3120993 3122845 You don't think nature can be evil?
3123120 3126089 No. Formidable. Frightening. But...
3126582 3128684 ...no, not evil.
3129835 3133147 Is a lion evil<br />because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3133547 3135949 Just what we take with us, then.
3136091 3137434 Yeah.
3137551 3139703 This crew represents<br />the best of humanity.
3139803 3141038 Even me?
3141138 3143207 You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.
3143307 3144708 There you go.
3144808 3147253 - Don't stay up.<br />- I'll be there in a minute.
3147353 3151498 Just remember, Coop,<br />you are literally wasting your breath.
3158072 3161341 Hey, TARS? Let's go over<br />that trajectory one more time.
3161575 3163343 Eight months to Mars.
3163744 3166647 Counter-orbital slingshot around.<br />Fourteen months to Saturn.
3166747 3168232 Nothing's changed on that.
3168332 3170517 Just let me ask you something.
3172670 3176231 - Dr. Brand and Edmunds...<br />- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
3177591 3180661 Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
3180761 3182246 I wouldn't know.
3182346 3185316 Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"<br />or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?
3185416 3188245 I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
3190104 3192372 But not a poker face, Slick.
3204618 3206169 Hey, guys.
3206286 3209473 Dad's about to go down for the long nap.
3209707 3212401 So I wanted to give you an update.
3214169 3217422 The Earth looks amazing from here.
3218424 3221327 You can't see any of the dust. Heh.
3222660 3225656 I really hope you guys are doing great.
3225889 3228598 I know you're gonna get this message.<br />Professor Brand's assured me that...
3228698 3230157 he's gonna get it to you.
3230686 3232830 Know that I love you.
3234148 3236583 - Is it him?<br />- I don't think so, Murph.
3243365 3245133 You must be Donald.
3247244 3248512 Hello, Murph.
3249163 3251265 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251790 3254059 He wanted me<br />to bring it for your brother.
3254710 3256979 He sent you a message.
3259965 3262034 She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
3262134 3266321 If you record any messages,<br />I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3267306 3270075 Murph is a bright spark.
3270976 3273587 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3273687 3276340 She's already making fools<br />of her teachers.
3276440 3279576 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280360 3283497 - So where are they?<br />- Heading for Mars.
3283906 3287910 The next time you hear from Cooper,<br />they'll be coming up on Saturn.
3328805 3333013 ...administration wants me to repeat<br />Plant Pathology. Which sucks.
3333413 3336725 But they said I could start<br />Advanced Agriculture a year early.
3338418 3342397 All right, I got to go, Dad.<br />Hope you're safe up there.
3346343 3347995 Sorry, Coop.
3348095 3353033 I asked Murph to say hi,<br />but she's as stubborn as her old man.
3353350 3355285 I'll try again next time.
3370200 3371852 You all right, Rom?
3374121 3377891 This gets to me, Cooper. This. This.
3378292 3381236 Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,<br />and then nothing...
3381336 3385399 out there for millions of miles<br />won't kill us in seconds.
3386216 3388202 You know that some of the finest...
3388302 3392239 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3392723 3395993 They don't know how.<br />And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.
3397644 3399705 We're explorers, Rom.
3401148 3404551 This is our boat. Here.
3431261 3433080 This is from the... relay probe?
3433180 3435323 It was in orbit around the Wormhole.
3435724 3438836 This is the Wormhole,<br />and every time we'd come around...
3438936 3442247 we would receive images<br />from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
3442481 3444675 Oh, yeah.<br />Like swinging a periscope around.
3444775 3445926 Exactly.
3446026 3450630 So we got a pretty good idea<br />what we're gonna find on the other side?
3451615 3453050 Navigationally.
3454409 3458463 Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching<br />the Wormhole in about three hours.
3464544 3465887 Hey, Coop?
3466463 3469533 - Can we stop the spinning?<br />- Why?
3469633 3472269 Because we're close enough<br />to see it now?
3473804 3474997 All right.
3475097 3476281 Thanks.
3481937 3483964 There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!
3484064 3487593 Say it, don't spray it, Rom. It's a sphere.
3487693 3491955 Of course it is. What, you...?<br />You thought it would just be a hole?
3492864 3496051 No, it's just that all the illustrations<br />I've ever seen, they...
3496493 3499679 In the illustrations,<br />they're trying to show you how it works.
3500288 3504359 So they say you want to go<br />from here to there.
3504459 3506783 But it's too far, right?
3507170 3512067 So a Wormhole bends space like this,<br />so you can take a shortcut through...
3512300 3513952 a higher dimension.
3514052 3515612 Okay, so...
3515846 3518783 to show that,<br />they've turned three-dimensional space
3518883 3523962 into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole<br />into two dimensions, a circle.
3524062 3526614 What's a circle in three dimensions?
3527524 3529126 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3529443 3531044 A spherical hole.
3531486 3534422 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3534740 3539511 I'm not thanking anybody until we<br />get out of here in one piece, Rom.
3546426 3548445 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3549379 3551148 No one knows.
3558180 3559948 The others made it, right?
3561892 3563660 At least some of them.
3595509 3598778 Everybody ready to say goodbye<br />to our solar system?
3599554 3601656 To our galaxy.
3603475 3604618 Here we go.
3637134 3640704 The controls won't work here.<br />We're passing through the bulk.
3640804 3645325 It's space beyond our three dimensions.<br />All you can do is record and observe.
3656403 3657545 What is that?
3659823 3663927 - I think it's them.<br />- Distorting space-time.
3665912 3667097 Don't! Don't!
3695025 3696576 What was that?
3699279 3700880 The first handshake.
3702449 3703891 We're...
3705118 3706753 We're here.
3726806 3729126 So the lost communications came through.
3729226 3732170 - How?<br />- The relay on this side cached them.
3732270 3735915 So years of basic data.<br />No real surprises.
3736733 3740437 Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,<br />as has Dr. Mann's.
3740537 3742931 Edmunds' went down three years ago.
3743031 3744307 Transmitter failure?
3744407 3747477 Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up<br />right until it went dark.
3747577 3749396 But Miller's still<br />looks good though, right?
3749496 3751890 - Because she's coming up fast.<br />- DOYLE:
3752249 3754351 With one complication.
3754668 3757737 The planet is much closer to Gargantua<br />than we thought.
3757837 3760574 - Gargantua?<br />- It's what we're calling the black hole.
3760674 3763034 Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets<br />both orbit it.
3763134 3766413 - And Miller's is on the horizon?<br />- As a basketball around a hoop.
3766513 3768582 Landing there takes us<br />dangerously close.
3768682 3772035 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3774521 3777591 Look, I could swing around<br />that neutron star to decelerate.
3777691 3779434 No, it's not that. It's time.
3779534 3784339 The gravity on that planet will slow<br />our clock compared to Earth's drastically.
3784864 3786099 How bad?
3786199 3789844 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be...
3790620 3792889 seven years back on Earth.
3793665 3794808 Jesus.
3795041 3796810 Well, that's relativity, folks.
3798128 3800655 Well, we can't just drop down<br />there without...
3800755 3802699 Cooper, we have a mission.
3802799 3805452 Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,<br />and our mission Plan A is...
3805552 3808788 to find a planet that can habitate<br />the people that are living on Earth right now.
3808888 3811791 You can't just think about your family.<br />Now you have to think bigger than that.
3811891 3814970 I am thinking about my family<br />and millions of other families, okay?
3815070 3819624 Plan A does not work if the people on Earth<br />are dead by the time we pull it off.
3820717 3824587 No. It doesn't.<br />That's why there's a Plan B.
3826406 3829449 Okay. Cooper's right.<br />We need to think of time as a resource,
3829549 3832011 just like oxygen and food.<br />Going down it's gonna cost us.
3834289 3835957 All right, look.
3836750 3840278 Dr. Mann's data is promising,<br />but it's gonna take months to get there.
3840378 3842656 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3842756 3846993 Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has<br />is very promising. It's water, it's organics...
3847093 3849329 - You don't find that every day.<br />- No, you don't.
3849429 3851831 And just think about the resources,<br />including time...
3851931 3854534 that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3855560 3857020 - Romilly...<br />- Yeah?
3857120 3861424 ...how far off from Miller's planet do we<br />have to be to stay out of the time shift?
3861524 3863260 Just back from the cusp.
3863360 3866388 All right, which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3866488 3868381 - Right.<br />- Okay.
3869199 3872060 Here's Gargantua.<br />Here's Miller's planet.
3872160 3875397 Instead of taking the Endurance<br />into orbit around Miller's planet...
3875497 3878441 which would conserve fuel,<br />but we would lose a lot of time...
3878541 3881709 what if we take a wider orbit<br />around Gargantua,
3881809 3885365 parallel with Miller's planet<br />outside of this time shift, to here?
3885465 3888326 Then we take the Ranger down,<br />we get Miller, we get her samples.
3888426 3891204 We come back, we analyze, we debrief.<br />We're in, we're out.
3891304 3893707 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a whole lot of time.
3893807 3895509 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3895609 3898136 There's no time for monkey business<br />or chit-chat down there.
3898236 3901098 So, TARS,<br />you should definitely stay here.
3901198 3903717 CASE, you're with me.<br />Anyone else can stay.
3903817 3907935 If we're talking about a couple years,<br />I could use the time to research gravity.
3908035 3910598 Observations from the Wormhole,<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910698 3912434 TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3912534 3917355 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,<br />but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.
3917455 3920066 - You got it?<br />- I wouldn't leave you behind...
3920166 3921309 Dr. Brand.
3925880 3927607 - You ready, CASE?<br />- Yup.
3928466 3932070 - You don't say much, do you?<br />- TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3933179 3934322 Detach.
3941521 3944582 - Romilly, are you reading these forces?<br />- It's unbelievable.
3947694 3950221 A literal heart of darkness.
3953992 3956770 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside...
3956870 3959722 the singularity, yeah,<br />we'd solve gravity.
3960039 3963401 - And we can't get anything from it?<br />- Nothing escapes that horizon.
3963501 3964903 Not even light.
3965003 3968606 - The answer's there, just no way to see it.<br />- There's Miller's planet.
3971176 3973210 Goodbye, Ranger.
3985315 3987675 This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3987775 3990128 - Should we use the thrusters to slow?<br />- No.
3990487 3993890 I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics<br />to save some fuel.
3993990 3995266 Air brake?
3995366 3998978 - We want to get down fast, don't we?<br />- We want to get there in one piece.
3999078 4002181 - Hang on.<br />- Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4017931 4020500 - We should ease!<br />- Hands where I can see them.
4020600 4024003 The only time I went down was<br />when a machine was easing at the wrong time.
4024103 4027006 - A little caution...<br />- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.
4027106 4029375 - Cooper, it's too damn fast!<br />- I got this.
4034113 4038217 - Should I disable the feedback?<br />- No. I need to feel the air.
4042321 4043589 Here we go.
4046584 4047977 It's just water!
4049379 4050980 The stuff of life.
4051339 4052824 Twelve hundred meters.
4052924 4055034 - Do we have a fix on the beacon?<br />- Got it!
4055134 4057829 - Can you maneuver?<br />- I'll need to shave some speed.
4057929 4060657 I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.<br />Everybody hang on!
4062976 4064118 Seven hundred.
4066145 4068247 On my cue, CASE. On my cue.
4071651 4073252 Five hundred meters.
4082620 4083763 Fire!
4097218 4099654 - Very graceful.<br />- No.
4100179 4103365 But very efficient.
4104726 4107003 What are you waiting for? Let's go!
4107103 4109122 Go, go, go!
4109239 4112792 Seven years per hour here.<br />Let's make it count!
4138801 4140153 This way.
4142889 4144741 About 200 meters.
4154150 4156277 The gravity's punishing.
4156736 4158930 Been floating through space too long?
4159030 4161307 110% Earth gravity.
4161407 4163709 Come on. Come on.
4166037 4168973 - There's nothing here.<br />- Should be right here.
4170792 4174095 If the signal's<br />coming from here, then...
4183429 4185097 Her beacon.
4192730 4193873 Wreckage.
4194440 4195708 Where's the rest?
4196109 4197710 Towards the mountains!
4201447 4203382 Those aren't mountains.
4204951 4206385 They're waves.
4211624 4214393 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
4214794 4216896 That one's moving away from us.
4223302 4225071 We need the recorder.
4235148 4237467 Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
4237567 4241012 We're not leaving without her data.
4241112 4244390 Get back here now! We do not have time!
4244490 4247051 The second wave is coming!<br />We're in the middle of a swell.
4248244 4249729 No, I got it.
4249829 4251931 Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
4256836 4258980 Brand, get back here now!
4260840 4263150 No, Cooper, go.<br />Cooper, go. I can't make it.
4263468 4265945 - Go!<br />- CASE, go get her.
4270641 4272743 - Go!<br />- Get up. Get up, Brand!
4273561 4275162 Go, go! Go!
4276647 4279584 - I'm not gonna make it!<br />- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!
4286324 4288718 Come on, CASE has her!<br />Get back here, Doyle!
4291621 4293005 Come on!
4295458 4296976 Get to the hatch!
4301422 4303024 Go, go! Go!
4308471 4309655 Shit.
4310056 4311991 Manually overriding inside hatch!
4315394 4316662 Cooper! Wait!
4323903 4327673 The engines are flooded!<br />I'm gonna have to shut her down.
4361023 4362458 Holy shit.
4366779 4368214 Hang on!
4399353 4403290 - CASE, what's the problem?<br />- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4404317 4405593 Goddamn it!
4405693 4410431 - I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?<br />- And I told you to get your ass back here!
4410531 4415302 - One of us was thinking about the mission!<br />- You were thinking about getting home.
4417038 4419440 I was trying to do the right thing!
4419540 4421600 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4423594 4426063 - CASE, how much time?<br />- Forty-five to an hour.
4427757 4431545 The stuff of life?<br />What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
4432345 4434372 A lot. Decades.
4441520 4442955 What happened to Miller?
4443606 4449220 Judging by the wreckage, she was<br />broken up by a wave soon after impact.
4449320 4452256 How's the wreckage stayed together<br />after all these years?
4453407 4455709 Because of the time slippage.
4456535 4461140 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4461958 4464402 She probably just died minutes ago.
4464502 4468647 The data Doyle received was just<br />the initial status echoing endlessly.
4468923 4471192 Oh, we are not prepared for this.
4473469 4476998 You eggheads have the survival skills<br />of a Boy Scout troop.
4477098 4480418 Well, we got this far on our brains.<br />Farther than any human in history.
4480518 4482336 Well, not far enough!
4482436 4486040 And now we're stuck here till there<br />won't be anyone left on Earth to save.
4488985 4491754 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4496450 4498352 Is there any possibility...
4498452 4502148 I don't know, some kind of a way<br />we can maybe all jump in a black hole?
4502248 4504016 Gain back the years?
4504583 4506152 Don't shake your head at me.
4506252 4508321 Time is relative, okay?
4508421 4511565 It can stretch<br />and it can squeeze, but...
4511966 4514243 it can't run backwards. It just can't.
4514343 4518864 The only thing that can move across<br />dimensions, like time, is gravity.
4521475 4522943 Okay.
4524603 4528549 The beings that led us here,<br />they communicate...
4528649 4530551 - ...through gravity, right?<br />- Yes.
4530651 4532920 Could they be talking to us<br />from the future?
4533738 4536090 - Maybe.<br />- Okay. If they can...
4537199 4540553 "They" are beings of five dimensions.
4540870 4544306 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544540 4545975 To them...
4546292 4550529 the past might be a canyon<br />that they can climb into and the future...
4550629 4553732 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4554717 4558236 Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.
4559305 4562658 - But you knew about relativity.<br />- Oh.
4564268 4565936 Brand...
4570316 4572535 my daughter was 10 years old.
4572860 4575754 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4576072 4579008 Couldn't you have told her<br />you were going to save the world?
4579492 4581034 No.
4582203 4586673 When you become a parent,<br />one thing becomes really clear.
4587875 4591145 And that is that you want to make sure<br />your children feel safe.
4592088 4596241 And it rules out telling a 10-year-old<br />that the world is ending.
4598202 4599778 Cooper?
4603390 4605960 - How long for the engines, CASE?<br />- A minute or two.
4606060 4608245 We don't have it. Helmets on!
4612066 4613926 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4614026 4616595 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616695 4618505 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4618697 4620132 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4625913 4627264 Engines up!
4656026 4657628 Hello, Rom.
4657987 4659955 I've waited years.
4660739 4663275 How...? How many years?
4664410 4667438 - By now it must be...<br />- Twenty-three years...
4667538 4669548 four months, eight days.
4673669 4675337 Doyle?
4681051 4684254 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4685431 4687032 Reality's different.
4687975 4689744 And Miller?
4690728 4692830 There's nothing here for us.
4695582 4697084 Why didn't you sleep?
4697943 4702131 Oh, I had a couple of stretches.<br />But I stopped believing you were coming back.
4702531 4705634 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706368 4709305 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole...
4709580 4712108 but I couldn't send anything<br />to your father.
4712208 4714527 We've been receiving,<br />but nothing gets out.
4714627 4717012 - Is he alive?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4717129 4719323 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
4721926 4725029 We've got years of messages stored.
4725221 4726455 Cooper.
4726555 4729858 Messages span 23 years.
4731602 4733370 Play it from the beginning.
4736315 4738325 Hey, Dad.
4738859 4741578 Checking in. Saying hi.
4744031 4746124 Finished second in school.
4747409 4750020 Miss Kurling's still<br />giving me C's though.
4750120 4753257 Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.
4754124 4756693 Grandpa attended the ceremony.
4757920 4760022 Oh.
4760881 4762908 I met another girl, Dad.
4763008 4764893 I...
4765344 4767646 I really think this is the one.
4768639 4771925 Name's Lois. That's her right there.
4774270 4776772 Murphy stole Grandpa's car.
4776939 4780008 She crashed it. She's okay, though.
4780276 4781760 Hey, Dad.
4782278 4783912 Look at this!
4784446 4786248 You're a grandpa.
4787366 4789334 His name's Jesse.
4789702 4794857 I kind of wanted to call him Coop,<br />but Lois says... maybe next time.
4794957 4799478 Donald says he's already earned<br />the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.
4802548 4804441 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
4805134 4809071 Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."<br />Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.
4809388 4811990 Sorry it's been a while.
4813267 4814910 Just...
4816520 4818922 what with Jesse and all.
4825029 4827664 Grandpa died last week.
4827781 4831368 We buried him out in the back forty<br />next to Mom and...
4831744 4833428 Jesse.
4833704 4837290 Which is where we would have buried you<br />if you'd ever...
4837541 4839643 come back.
4840544 4843096 Murph was there at the funeral.
4843422 4846375 We don't see her that much,<br />but she came for that.
4849386 4852405 You aren't listening to this,<br />I know that.
4854933 4857786 All these messages are just, like...
4858854 4863024 drifting out there in the darkness.
4863609 4866044 Lois says that...
4866737 4869765 I have to let you go.
4869865 4871800 And...
4872201 4873885 So...
4876538 4879825 I guess I'm letting you go.
4880584 4883753 I don't know where you are, Dad...
4883879 4886807 but I hope that you're at peace.
4888300 4889685 Goodbye.
4902981 4904633 Hey, Dad.
4907069 4908304 Hey, Murph.
4908404 4910822 You son of a bitch.
4914034 4916603 I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding...
4916703 4919339 because I was so mad at you for leaving.
4922084 4924569 And then when you went quiet, it...
4926797 4930233 seemed like I should live with that decision.<br />And I have.
4934138 4936857 But today's my birthday.
4940227 4943897 And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...
4947526 4952164 You once told me that when you came back,<br />we might be the same age.
4953574 4956960 And today I'm the age you were<br />when you left.
4959663 4961815 So it would be a real good time<br />for you to come back.
4976221 4980617 I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that<br />I've never seen you in here before.
4981143 4983412 I've never been in here before.
4985189 4990427 I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps.
4990694 4993514 - I'm glad you've started.<br />- I haven't. I...
4993614 4996216 I just had something<br />I needed to get out.
4996450 4998936 - I know they're still out there.<br />- I know.
4999036 5003315 There are so many reasons their<br />communications might not be getting through.
5003415 5004933 I know, professor.
5005459 5008478 I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
5009546 5012382 Them never coming back or...
5013091 5016370 coming back to find we've failed.
5016470 5017988 Then let's succeed.
5018931 5020473 So...
5020682 5024920 back to the fourth iteration.<br />Let's run it through some new fields.
5025020 5028424 With respect, professor,<br />we've tried that hundreds of times.
5028524 5032694 It only has to work once, Murph.
5035489 5039435 Every rivet that they strike<br />could have been a bullet.
5039535 5041603 We've done well for the world here...
5041703 5046525 whether or not we crack the equation<br />before I kick the bucket.
5046625 5049603 - Don't be morbid, professor.<br />- I'm not afraid of death.
5050254 5052589 I'm an old physicist.
5053340 5055108 I'm afraid of time.
5062182 5063450 Time.
5065394 5067162 You're afraid of time.
5069648 5071717 We've been trying<br />to solve the equation...
5071817 5074386 without changing<br />the underlying assumption about time.
5074486 5076263 - And?<br />- And that means...
5076363 5080893 each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5080993 5083312 It's recursive. It's nonsensical.
5083412 5087274 Are you calling my life's work...<br />nonsense, Murph?
5087374 5089285 No, I'm saying<br />that you've been trying to...
5089385 5093680 finish it with one arm...<br />No, with both arms tied behind your back.
5095465 5097867 And I don't understand why.
5098427 5100662 I'm an old man, Murph.
5101179 5103874 Can we take this point up<br />at another time?
5103974 5106401 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108270 5110797 Stepping out into the universe...
5110897 5114793 we must confront the reality<br />of interstellar travel.
5115611 5120224 We must reach far beyond<br />our own lifespans.
5120324 5125854 We must think not as individuals<br />but as a species.
5128290 5131617 Do not go gentle into that good night
5133086 5135739 TARS kept the Endurance<br />right where we needed her.
5135839 5138734 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
5138967 5142571 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
5142804 5144606 we have to choose.
5145515 5146942 But how?
5147684 5149653 They're both promising.
5150896 5155467 Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting, so...
5155567 5158787 We've no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds's data would have soured.
5159404 5161974 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162074 5165543 - As does Dr. Mann's.<br />- Cooper, this is my field.
5166411 5167754 And...
5168246 5170482 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170582 5174219 - Why?<br />- Gargantua, that's why.
5175045 5179157 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...
5179257 5183979 but no life. Sterile.<br />We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
5184096 5185956 Because of the black hole?
5186056 5189167 Murphy's Law.<br />Whatever can happen will happen.
5189267 5191670 Accident is the first building block<br />of evolution.
5191770 5194673 But when you're orbiting a black hole<br />not enough can happen.
5194773 5199344 It sucks in asteroids and comets,<br />other events which would otherwise reach you.
5199444 5201579 We need to go further afield.
5201905 5204541 You once said that Dr. Mann...
5205492 5207185 was the best of us.
5207285 5210755 He's remarkable.<br />We're only here because of him.
5210997 5212899 And yet... Yet here he is.
5212999 5217285 He's on the ground, and he's sending<br />a very unambiguous message,
5217385 5219906 telling us to come to his planet.
5220006 5224936 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5225095 5226204 We should vote.
5226304 5228773 Well, if we vote,<br />there's something you should know.
5229599 5232777 Brand? He has a right to know.
5232978 5234796 That has nothing to do with it.
5234896 5238008 - What does?<br />- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238108 5241152 - Is that true?<br />- Yes.
5243822 5246833 And that makes me<br />want to follow my heart.
5249995 5253732 But maybe we've spent too long trying<br />to figure all this out with theory.
5253832 5255317 You're a scientist, Brand.
5255417 5257260 So listen to me...
5257794 5262807 when I say that love<br />isn't something we invented. It's...
5263508 5266144 observable, powerful.
5267929 5269606 It has to mean something.
5269706 5274052 Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,<br />social bonding, child rearing...
5274152 5277956 We love people who have died.<br />Where's the social utility in that?
5278398 5279508 None.
5279608 5283553 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't...
5283653 5285764 yet understand.
5285864 5289626 Maybe it's some evidence, some...
5290285 5294815 artifact of a higher dimension<br />that we can't consciously perceive.
5294915 5299778 I'm drawn across the universe<br />to someone I haven't seen in a decade...
5299878 5302948 who I know is probably dead.
5303048 5306451 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving...
5306551 5309687 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311223 5315860 Maybe we should trust that,<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5320565 5322534 All right, Cooper...
5324110 5325703 yes...
5326571 5330108 the tiniest possibility<br />of seeing Wolf again excites me.
5330742 5332710 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5333119 5335588 Honestly, Amelia...
5337082 5338350 it might.
5345048 5348059 TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
5364851 5368121 We'll lose about a third again.<br />But next year...
5370115 5373051 Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm<br />and we'll make it up.
5373785 5375920 What happened to Nelson?
5381543 5383820 Murph, have you eaten enough?<br />Would you like some more souffle?
5383920 5387599 Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.<br />It was delicious.
5388174 5390476 Coop, finish your fritter, please.
5392345 5396124 Will you spend the night? Your room<br />is exactly as you left it. It's ready.
5396224 5397667 I need to get back.
5397767 5399578 My sewing machine is in there,<br />but there's plenty...
5399678 5402071 I need to...
5404649 5406692 Too many memories.
5406818 5409713 We might have something for that.<br />Hey, Coop.
5417162 5418555 The dust.
5420957 5423401 Lois, I have a friend who...
5423801 5425637 could look at his lungs.
5443521 5446258 - Amelia, I'm sorry.<br />- You were just being objective.
5446358 5449886 Unless you're punishing me<br />for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5449986 5452538 No, this wasn't a personal decision.
5453073 5457185 If you're wrong, you will have<br />a very personal decision to make.
5457285 5460480 Your fuel calculations<br />are based on a return journey.
5460580 5464651 Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have<br />to decide whether to return home...
5464751 5467112 or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
5467212 5471116 Starting a colony could save us<br />from extinction.
5471216 5474452 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again...
5474552 5476488 and the future of the human race.
5477689 5479699 I trust you'll be as objective then.
5486481 5488466 He's been asking for you<br />since he came to.
5488566 5490293 We were trying to reach you.
5496157 5497500 Murph.
5498201 5500003 I'm here, professor.
5500412 5502781 I let you all down.
5503081 5506718 No, you got us so far. Real close.
5508253 5510113 I'll finish what you started.
5510213 5512724 Good, good Murph.
5514718 5517312 You had faith...
5518221 5519814 all those...
5520473 5522567 all those years.
5523935 5525253 I...
5525353 5528156 I asked you to have faith.
5529607 5532702 I wanted you to believe...
5533903 5536080 that your father...
5538783 5540685 would come back.
5540785 5542078 I do, professor.
5543705 5547959 - Forgive me, Murph.<br />- There's nothing to forgive.
5551028 5554390 I... I lied, Murph.
5556468 5558561 I lied to you.
5564601 5567912 There was no need for him to...
5569022 5571199 To come back.
5573485 5577121 There is no way to help us.
5578114 5579457 But Plan A...
5579699 5583127 All this. All these people.
5583953 5586048 And the equation.
5589751 5591603 Did my father know?
5595298 5597508 Did he leave me?
5600970 5602313 Do...
5603181 5604816 not...
5605475 5607026 go...
5607936 5610021 gentle...
5611523 5612990 No.
5614359 5615943 No!
5616653 5618596 You can't leave.
5618696 5620248 You... No.
5621032 5626003 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today. He had no pain.
5626187 5628356 He was at peace.
5628623 5631008 I'm very sorry for your loss.
5643304 5645073 Brand, did you know?
5647392 5649360 He told you, right?
5651938 5653814 You knew.
5655233 5657326 This was all a sham.
5661406 5663591 You left us here.
5665243 5667044 To suffocate.
5668913 5670548 To starve.
5697609 5699043 Frozen cloud.
5843379 5846641 It's okay. It's okay.
5853181 5854982 It's okay.
5860104 5862406 Pray you never learn...
5863274 5866911 just how good it can be<br />to see another face.
5875036 5877605 I hadn't a lot of hope<br />to begin with, but...
5877705 5880341 after so long, I had none.
5881509 5884845 My supplies were completely exhausted.
5886506 5890559 The last time I went to sleep,<br />I didn't even set a waking date.
5893971 5896857 You have literally raised me<br />from the dead.
5897600 5899850 Lazarus.
5900686 5904240 - What about the others?<br />- I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5904649 5907368 So far, surely.
5907819 5912757 No, our present situation is that there's<br />very little chance of rescuing any others.
5916411 5918921 Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?
5919497 5921390 Tell us about your world.
5924669 5926612 Our world, we hope.
5930341 5932744 Our world... is cold...
5932844 5934637 stark...
5936013 5938149 but undeniably beautiful.
5940101 5943654 The days are 67 hours long, cold.
5947558 5949177 The nights are...
5949277 5952112 67 far colder hours.
5957452 5961856 The gravity is a very, very pleasant<br />80 percent of the Earth's.
5961956 5965193 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali...
5965293 5969113 and the air has too much ammonia to breathe<br />for more than just a few minutes...
5969213 5973868 but down at the surface,<br />and there is a surface...
5973968 5975660 the chlorine dissipates.
5975761 5979874 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons and breathable air.
5979974 5984245 To organics. Possibly even to life.
5984979 5987198 We might be sharing this world.
5987440 5989267 These readings are from the surface?
5989367 5992970 Over the years,<br />I've dropped various probes.
5993070 5996557 - How far have you explored?<br />- I've mounted several major expeditions.
5996657 6000778 But with oxygen in limited supply,<br />KIPP there really did most of the legwork.
6000878 6003606 - What went wrong with him, sir?<br />- Degeneration.
6003706 6007360 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
6007460 6011656 We struggled on for a time,<br />but ultimately I decommissioned him and...
6011756 6013991 used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014091 6017161 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.
6017261 6019230 Would you like me to look at him?
6019430 6021666 No. No. He needs a human touch.
6021766 6026337 Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message<br />for you from the comm station.
6026437 6029198 Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.
6040910 6043596 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.
6044205 6046331 He had no pain.
6048960 6050761 He was at peace.
6052547 6054682 I'm sorry for your loss.
6056759 6058102 Is that Murph?
6058511 6061038 She's... She's grown.
6061138 6063223 Brand, did you know?
6063891 6066060 He told you, right?
6068604 6070197 You knew.
6071649 6073250 This was all a sham.
6074193 6076361 You left us here.
6077989 6079790 To suffocate.
6081576 6083252 To starve.
6086289 6088073 Did my father know too?
6090459 6092219 Dad?
6093671 6095890 I just want to know...
6096924 6099126 if you left me here to die.
6101512 6103814 I just have to know.
6109020 6110738 Cooper, my...
6111939 6114133 My father dedicated...
6114233 6119738 his whole life to Plan A.<br />I have no idea what she's talking about.
6121048 6122616 I do.
6127246 6130215 He never even hoped<br />to get the people off the Earth?
6131125 6132635 No.
6136380 6140517 But he's been trying to solve<br />the gravity equation for 40 years.
6140718 6144438 Amelia, your father solved his equation<br />before I even left.
6144722 6146666 Then why wouldn't he use it?
6146766 6150795 The equation couldn't reconcile relativity<br />with quantum mechanics. You need more.
6150895 6152880 More? More what?
6152980 6156050 More data.<br />You need to see into a black hole.
6156150 6158302 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
6158402 6160204 Romilly, is that true?
6161197 6164976 If a black hole is an oyster,<br />then the singularity's the pearl inside.
6165076 6169913 The gravity's so strong, it's always<br />hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.
6170831 6172984 That's why we call it a black hole.
6173084 6176804 Okay, but if we see<br />beyond the horizon...
6177088 6178656 We can't, Coop.
6178756 6181492 There are some things<br />that aren't meant to be known.
6181592 6185705 Your father had to find another way<br />to save the human race from extinction.
6185805 6189441 - Plan B. A colony.<br />- Why not tell people?
6190726 6193879 - Why keep building those stations?<br />- He knew how hard it would be...
6193979 6198175 to get people to work together to save<br />the species instead of themselves.
6198475 6200720 - Or their children.<br />- Bullshit.
6200820 6203681 You never would've come here<br />unless you believed you would save them.
6203781 6206659 Evolution has yet to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
6206759 6210651 We can care deeply,<br />selflessly about those we know,
6210751 6213357 but that empathy rarely extends<br />beyond our line of sight.
6213457 6215467 But the lie.
6218462 6221081 That monstrous lie?
6222133 6225352 Unforgivable. And he knew that.
6225803 6230207 He was prepared to destroy his own humanity<br />in order to save the species.
6230307 6233027 - He made an incredible sacrifice.<br />- No.
6234145 6239124 An incredible sacrifice is being made<br />by the people on Earth who are gonna die!
6239483 6241752 Because in his fucking arrogance...
6242069 6244255 he declared their case hopeless.
6244822 6248392 I'm sorry, Cooper...<br />their case is hopeless.
6248492 6250919 No. No.
6251245 6252847 We are the future.
6256417 6258635 Cooper, what can I do?
6261547 6263482 Let me go home.
6263966 6265985 You're absolutely positive?
6266510 6269113 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6269680 6272408 - It's worthless?<br />- It's half the answer.
6273267 6276370 Okay, how do you find the other half?
6276854 6278589 Out there? A black hole.
6278689 6281825 - But stuck down here on Earth?<br />- Yeah?
6282860 6284828 I'm not sure you can.
6286447 6289416 God, they just pack up and leave.
6290534 6292920 What are they hoping to find?
6293204 6294546 Survival.
6302046 6303430 Damn it.
6306050 6309945 Murph, don't...?<br />Don't people have a right to know?
6310471 6314625 Panic won't help. We just<br />have to keep working, same as ever.
6314725 6318129 But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand<br />was manipulating us to do?
6318229 6321582 Brand gave up on us.<br />I'm still trying to solve this.
6322107 6323692 So...
6324610 6326579 do you have an idea?
6326987 6328622 A feeling.
6331742 6334044 I told you about my ghost.
6335746 6338049 My dad thought I called it a ghost...
6338149 6340217 because I was scared of it.
6343379 6345712 But I was never scared of it.
6346924 6349893 I called it a ghost because it felt...
6352012 6353981 It felt like a person.
6356225 6358193 It was trying to tell me something.
6360855 6363958 If there's an answer here on Earth,<br />it's back there...
6364316 6368829 somehow, in that room.<br />So I have to find it.
6371949 6374001 We're running out of time.
6375619 6377688 What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
6377788 6380024 No, they can stay.<br />I'll be sleeping anyway.
6380124 6381776 - Hey, Coop?<br />- Yeah?
6381876 6383944 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6384044 6386897 - Yeah, what's that?<br />- Have one last crack at the black hole.
6388674 6390126 I'm going home, Rom.
6390226 6393979 Yeah, I know.<br />This isn't going to cost you any time.
6394430 6396465 There's a chance for the people on Earth.
6397016 6400127 - Talk to me.<br />- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
6400227 6404173 - It's what we call a gentle singularity.<br />- Gentle?
6404273 6407802 They're hardly gentle.<br />But the tidal gravity is so quick that...
6407902 6412223 something crossing the horizon fast<br />might survive. A probe, say.
6412323 6417061 - What happens after it crosses?<br />- After the horizon is a complete mystery.
6417161 6420314 So, what's to say<br />there isn't some way that the probe...
6420414 6423400 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423500 6426821 If he's equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6426921 6430015 Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," professor?
6430257 6432309 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432843 6434829 I've already told him what to look for.
6434929 6437706 I'd need the old optical transmitter<br />off KIPP, Cooper.
6437806 6439208 You'd do this for us?
6439308 6443529 Before you get all teary, remember that<br />as a robot I have to do anything you say.
6444146 6447616 - Your cue light's broken.<br />- I'm not joking.
6449944 6453264 I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt<br />some components from KIPP.
6453364 6455766 I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6455866 6457601 I'll supervise.
6457701 6458811 All right.
6458911 6463649 Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.<br />One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
6463749 6466277 Once those modules have landed,<br />you don't want to move them.
6466377 6468988 I can take you to the probe sites,<br />but I don't think...
6469088 6471866 these conditions are gonna hold.<br />I think we should wait.
6471966 6474869 CASE is headed down<br />with the rest of the distillery equipment.
6474969 6478105 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6479723 6483110 Well, these squalls do usually blow over.
6483227 6484420 Okay, then.
6484520 6486797 - You'll need a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6486897 6488740 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6489024 6490367 Follow me.
6490859 6494505 - TARS, 72 hours, yeah?<br />- Roger that, Cooper.
6500703 6504047 Brand told me why you feel<br />you have to go back.
6505482 6508569 But I'd be remiss<br />if I didn't at least mention...
6508669 6512940 that a mission such as ours<br />could certainly use an extra engineer.
6514675 6519029 You better slow down, turbo.<br />Safety first, CASE, remember.
6519555 6521607 Safety first, Cooper.
6522558 6525636 I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,<br />I'm honored to be a part of this.
6525936 6531242 But once we set up base camp and secure<br />those modules, my work's done here.
6531358 6532693 I'm going home.
6540701 6543861 You have attachments.<br />But even without a family...
6543961 6549384 I can promise you that that yearning<br />to be with other people is powerful.
6549752 6553388 That emotion is at the foundation...
6553756 6556900 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.
6564808 6567494 - How long have you had that cough?<br />- A while.
6577946 6580165 Mom lets me play in here.
6581584 6583335 I don't touch your stuff.
6614024 6615951 Just take this gently.
6620781 6624459 You know why we couldn't just send machines<br />on these missions, don't you, Cooper?
6624785 6629514 A machine doesn't improvise well<br />because you can't program a fear of death.
6630290 6634609 Our survival instinct is our single<br />greatest source of inspiration.
6634723 6636638 Take you, for example.
6637047 6638682 A father...
6638882 6642185 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6643053 6648024 What does research tell us is the last thing<br />you're going to see before you die?
6649434 6652129 Your children. Their faces.
6652229 6656992 At the moment of death, your mind's<br />gonna push a little bit harder to survive.
6657401 6658943 For them.
6659319 6660871 Deep breath.
6662865 6666810 Hey. I bet you're Coop.<br />Why don't you have a seat here for me?
6666910 6669546 It's bad. They cannot stay here.
6669955 6671348 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.
6679590 6681116 TARS, what's taking so long?
6681216 6684161 Professor, I am having trouble<br />completing the boot up.
6684261 6686004 I don't understand.
6692603 6694154 It's funny.
6695939 6697866 When I left Earth...
6698567 6700952 I thought I was prepared to die.
6702696 6704531 The truth is...
6706241 6711546 I never really considered the possibility<br />that my planet wasn't the one.
6713957 6716360 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.
6716460 6718002 Let's go.
6725969 6728864 All right, buddy,<br />give me a big deep breath.
6733560 6735078 What is this?
6735395 6739466 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.
6739566 6742136 We're gonna need it<br />to complete the mission...
6742236 6745848 once the others realize<br />what this place isn't.
6745948 6750269 We cannot survive here.<br />I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
6759962 6763157 - They can't stay here anymore.<br />- You have to leave right now.
6763257 6766869 Let me make something abundantly clear.<br />You have a responsibility...
6766969 6770230 - Oh! Jesus!<br />- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.
6770430 6772416 Dad didn't raise you<br />to be this dumb, Tom!
6772516 6776703 Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.<br />And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.
6777187 6780156 You faked all the data?
6781566 6782951 Yeah.
6786655 6788432 There's no surface?
6788532 6790000 No.
6790659 6792728 I tried to do my duty, Cooper...
6792828 6798133 but I knew the day that I arrived here<br />that this place had nothing.
6798458 6802554 And I resisted<br />the temptation for years...
6802879 6805199 but I knew that...
6805299 6808327 if I just pressed that button, then...
6808427 6810529 somebody would come and save me.
6811471 6813073 You fucking coward.
6813807 6814950 Yes.
6820272 6821615 Yes.
6823233 6824576 Yes.
6825527 6826637 Yes.
6838081 6842727 Listen, if you're not going to go,<br />let your family go. Just save your family.
6843128 6847574 And we go live underground with you?<br />Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
6847674 6851648 Dad's not coming back.<br />He never was coming back. It's up to me.
6851748 6854661 You're gonna save everybody?<br />Because Dad couldn't do it.
6854761 6859069 Dad didn't even try!<br />Dad just abandoned us!
6859519 6861613 He left us here to die.
6862022 6863790 Nobody's going with you.
6867402 6870413 You gonna wait for your next kid to die?
6873116 6874709 Get out.
6875285 6876920 And don't come back.
6881500 6883635 You can keep my stuff.
6894262 6895939 Stop it!
6898642 6900527 No. No!
6901311 6904489 Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance<br />you're gonna kill yourself!
6905023 6907092 Those are the best odds<br />I've had in years.
6927462 6929597 Don't judge me, Cooper.
6930048 6934386 You were never tested like I was.<br />Few men have been.
6942727 6944195 You tried your best, Murph.
6953405 6955703 You're feeling it, aren't you?
6956450 6958585 The survival instinct.
6959202 6963640 That's what drove me. It's what drives<br />all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.
6964708 6968344 Because I want to save all of us.<br />For you, Cooper.
6973216 6976995 I'm sorry, I can't watch you<br />go through this. I'm sorry.
6977095 6980064 I thought I could, but I can't.
6980849 6983210 I'm here. I'm here for you.
6983310 6985653 Just listen to my voice, Cooper.
6986146 6987981 I'm right here.
6989316 6990950 You're not alone.
7000368 7002070 Do you see your children?
7005123 7006758 It's okay.
7007417 7009469 They're right there with you.
7013048 7015934 Did Professor Brand tell you<br />that poem before you left?
7016468 7018269 Do you remember?
7020347 7023616 Do not go gentle into that good night
7024935 7029781 Old age should burn and rave<br />At close of day
7031066 7033743 Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light
7058093 7059828 Brand! Help!
7059928 7062188 - Help!<br />- Cooper?
7068603 7070088 CASE!
7070188 7071781 No air.
7072315 7073825 Ammonia.
7074609 7077179 Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!
7077279 7079264 - I have a fix.<br />- Go! Go, go, go!
7079364 7081749 And away!
7093003 7095280 Cooper, we're coming.<br />Hang in there. Don't talk.
7095380 7097974 Try to breathe as little as possible.<br />We're almost there.
7101444 7107066 There's a security lockout, sir.<br />It requires a person to access function.
7111813 7113615 It's all yours, sir.
7121631 7123391 Try not to breathe.
7123992 7128021 We're coming. We're coming right now.<br />CASE, come on! Come on!
7128121 7131132 We got to go faster, CASE!<br />Faster, faster, faster!
7135337 7137347 Hang in there. Come on.
7143553 7147148 I see him, I see him!<br />CASE, bank! Bank right!
7165867 7168970 Cooper! Cooper! I'm here!
7192102 7194304 This data makes no sense.
7202529 7204014 I'm sorry.
7204114 7207000 - What?<br />- Mann was lying!
7214457 7216551 Go. Go.
7217335 7218653 Romilly.
7218753 7220030 Romilly!
7220130 7222849 Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?
7223133 7225235 Step back, professor! Step back!
7233059 7235945 - Romilly...<br />- Romilly, do you read me?
7238648 7240483 Keep watch!
7241151 7242377 Lois?
7242777 7245580 - What happened to caution, CASE?<br />- Safety first, Cooper.
7246656 7250376 Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?<br />This is Brand.
7252954 7254064 Romilly?
7254164 7257050 Dr. Brand. Cooper.<br />There's been an explosion.
7257375 7259469 Dr. Mann's compound.
7286780 7289123 TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!
7295205 7297465 Let me know when TARS is aboard.
7300794 7302970 Romilly did not survive.
7303880 7305615 I could not save him.
7305715 7307242 - TARS is in.<br />- I'll take her now.
7307342 7310286 - Do we have a fix on the Ranger?<br />- He's pushing into orbit!
7310386 7313689 If he takes control<br />of that ship, we're dead.
7314599 7317860 - He'd maroon us?<br />- He is marooning us.
7319562 7322365 I'll meet you guys downstairs.<br />Go wait by the car.
7329906 7334418 Come on! Give me your bag.<br />Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!
7339749 7341968 Dr. Mann, please respond.
7342293 7344446 Dr. Mann, please respond!
7344746 7346823 He doesn't know<br />the Endurance docking procedure.
7346923 7349725 - The autopilot does.<br />- Not since TARS disabled it.
7350635 7351745 Nice.
7351845 7355064 - What's your trust setting, TARS?<br />- Lower than yours apparently.
7358393 7362005 Do not attempt docking.<br />I repeat, do not attempt docking.
7362105 7363214 Please res...
7422582 7425026 Auto-docking sequence withheld.
7425126 7428095 - Override.<br />- Unauthorized.
7428504 7430139 Override.
7430340 7432516 Unauthorized.
7436346 7440575 Do not attempt docking. I repeat,<br />do not attempt docking. Please resp...
7484268 7486537 Moving slowly toward the Endurance.
7510962 7512614 Imperfect contact.
7512714 7515057 - Override.<br />- Hatch lockout.
7522557 7525401 - Is he locked on yet?<br />- Imperfectly.
7526936 7528254 Dr. Mann, do not...
7549667 7552970 Hatch lockout disengaged.
7561220 7564958 Dr. Mann, do not,<br />I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7565058 7567001 I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7567101 7570237 If you open the hatch,<br />the airlock will depressurize.
7595838 7598432 - What happens if he blows the airlock?<br />- Nothing good.
7604013 7606708 Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,<br />everything we've got, CASE!
7606808 7608584 - Thrusters are full!<br />- Back!
7608684 7610753 Relay my transmission<br />to the onboard computer...
7610853 7613006 and have it rebroadcast<br />as emergency P.A.
7613106 7614448 Dr. Mann...
7616734 7619679 I repeat, do not open<br />the inner hatch. I repeat...
7619779 7621122 Brand?
7621656 7623766 I don't know what he said to you...
7623866 7626836 but I am taking command<br />of the Endurance.
7626994 7629338 And then we can talk<br />about completing the mission.
7632500 7634310 Dr. Mann, listen to me.
7635002 7637304 This is not about my life.
7637630 7641183 Or Cooper's life.<br />This is about all mankind.
7641467 7643085 There is a moment...
7649225 7650660 It is not sa...
7658860 7660002 Oh, my God.
7678212 7682475 - There's no point using fuel to chase...<br />- Analyze the Endurance's spin.
7687430 7689940 - Cooper, what are you doing?<br />- Docking.
7694228 7697131 Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.
7697231 7699759 Okay, get ready to match our spin<br />with the retro thrusters.
7699859 7703379 - It's not possible.<br />- No... it's necessary.
7714916 7717384 Endurance is hitting stratosphere!
7721130 7723474 She's got no heat shield.
7726302 7728154 - CASE, you ready?<br />- Ready.
7736479 7739949 Cooper! This is no time for caution.
7741192 7743719 CASE, if I black out,<br />you take the stick.
7743819 7746580 TARS, get ready to engage<br />the docking mechanism.
7753329 7756399 - Endurance is starting to heat.<br />- Twenty feet out.
7756499 7759068 I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.
7759168 7761237 Ten feet out.
7761337 7763906 Cooper, we are lined up.
7764006 7765691 Initiating spin!
7807174 7808484 Come on, TARS.
7816642 7818285 Come on, TARS!
7829405 7832124 - We are locked, Cooper.<br />- Locked. Easing up!
7839707 7841342 Easy.
7842209 7843844 Easy.
7849383 7850785 Retro thrusters!
7858851 7860653 Main engines on.
7866108 7869019 Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.
7876827 7878796 Killing main engines!
7879747 7881715 Okay, we're out of orbit.
7888756 7891834 Okay. And for our next trick!
7893469 7897606 It'll have to be good.<br />We're heading into Gargantua's pull.
7898224 7899366 Oh, shit.
7899767 7901660 - CASE, take the stick.<br />- Roger that.
7951527 7953963 Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.
7955197 7957224 Shall I use main engines?
7957324 7961503 No. We got to let her slide<br />as far as we can.
7970004 7972948 - Give it to me.<br />- There's good news, there's bad news.
7973048 7976777 Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.<br />Give it to me straight.
7985519 7988798 The backup generator kicked in,<br />so the system's stable. They're all good.
7988898 7990240 Good.
7990357 7993761 Okay. The navigational hub<br />has been completely destroyed.
7993861 7996889 We don't have enough life support<br />to make it back to Earth, but...
7996989 7999141 I think we can scratch our way<br />to Edmunds' planet.
7999241 8003596 - What about fuel?<br />- Not enough. But I have a plan.
8004121 8008525 We let Gargantua pull us down<br />close to her horizon.
8008626 8011946 Then a powered slingshot around,<br />launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
8012046 8014615 - Manually?<br />- That's what I'm here for.
8014715 8017293 I'm gonna take us<br />just inside the critical orbit.
8017393 8020162 - What about time slippage?<br />- Neither of us has time to worry...
8020262 8022232 about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.
8026560 8028162 I'm sorry, Cooper.
8031190 8034677 Once we've gathered<br />enough speed around Gargantua...
8034777 8036912 we use Lander 1...
8037112 8039706 and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...
8040274 8043076 push us out of the black hole's gravity.
8044912 8047648 The Lender's linkages<br />have been destroyed...
8047748 8050384 so we'll have to control manually.
8051293 8054622 Once Lander 1 is spent,<br />TARS will detach...
8054722 8056832 And get sucked into that black hole.
8057258 8058885 Why does TARS have to detach?
8058985 8061495 We have to shed the weight<br />to escape the gravity.
8061595 8063038 Newton's third law.
8063138 8065916 The only way humans have ever<br />figured out of getting somewhere...
8066016 8067626 is to leave something behind.
8067726 8070837 Cooper, you can't ask TARS<br />to do this for us.
8070938 8074842 He's a robot. So you don't have<br />to ask him to do anything.
8074942 8078662 - Cooper, you asshole!<br />- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
8078862 8081348 It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.
8081448 8083976 It's our only chance<br />to save people on Earth.
8084076 8087354 If I can find a way to transmit<br />the quantum data I'll find in there...
8087454 8089590 they might still make it.
8090533 8093460 Let's just hope<br />there's still someone there to save.
8121447 8123415 Maximum velocity achieved.
8124366 8126936 Prepare to fire escape thrusters.
8127336 8129772 - Ready?<br />- Ready.
8129872 8133067 - Ready.<br />- Main engine ignition in three...
8133167 8134635 two...
8134960 8136895 one. Mark.
8150225 8151777 Come on, baby.
8152645 8155047 Lander 1 engines, on my mark.
8155601 8157800 Three, two...
8157900 8159701 one. Mark.
8164740 8167393 Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.
8167493 8170170 Three, two, one...
8170412 8171880 - Mark.<br />- Fire!
8181715 8185185 This little maneuver's<br />gonna cost us 51 years!
8185761 8188563 You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!
8203654 8207124 Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.
8207491 8210193 Three, two...
8211020 8214056 - one. Mark.<br />- Detach!
8217126 8219695 - Goodbye, TARS.<br />- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.
8219795 8222898 - See you on the other side, Coop.<br />- See you there, Slick!
8231306 8233191 Okay, CASE.
8233634 8237612 - Nice reckless flying!<br />- Learned from the master.
8237771 8240424 - Ranger 2, prepare to detach.<br />- What?
8240524 8243744 No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?
8243902 8247681 Newton's third law.<br />You got to leave something behind.
8247781 8250267 You told me we had enough resources<br />for both of us.
8250367 8252394 We agreed, Amelia...
8252494 8254254 90 percent.
8255831 8257215 Don't.
8259126 8260594 Detach.
8273390 8276543 Okay, I am nosing down.
8279938 8282240 Approaching the event horizon.
8284193 8288997 Portside, dipping down beneath it<br />to go through it.
8290282 8293352 Heading towards blackness.
8293452 8295754 I have a visual of the event.
8295954 8297631 It's all black.
8299658 8303261 TARS, do you read me? It's all blackness.
8304963 8307765 TARS! Do you read me? Over.
8311804 8313271 Okay.
8314181 8315732 Screens...
8317059 8318860 getting interference.
8320270 8323156 Losing control of the stick.<br />I got flashes.
8323440 8325909 Flashes of lightness and blackness.
8326819 8329621 The turbulence in the gravity<br />is increasing.
8335994 8338204 The computers are going down. Agh.
8349925 8353061 Gravitational pull.<br />I'm losing control of the stick.

8731188 8732774 Make him stay, Murph.
8741483 8743660 Make him stay, Murph.
8744819 8747247 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8750158 8752877 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8758475 8761310 No! No! No!
8781698 8783499 It was you.
8794369 8796713 You were my ghost.
8806131 8809734 Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.
8810927 8813730 - TARS?<br />- Roger that.
8815223 8818151 - You survived.<br />- Somewhere...
8818393 8820503 in their fifth dimension.
8820603 8823006 They saved us.
8823106 8828386 Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?<br />And just why would they want to help us?
8828486 8831264 I don't know, but they constructed<br />this three-dimensional space...
8831364 8834726 inside their five-dimensional reality<br />to allow you to understand it.
8834826 8836853 Yeah, that ain't working.
8836953 8838563 Yes, it is.
8838663 8842609 You've seen that time is represented here<br />as a physical dimension.
8842709 8845845 You have worked out that you can exert<br />a force across space-time.
8846212 8849658 Gravity to send a message.
8849958 8851592 Affirmative.
8853678 8855304 Gravity...
8855930 8859501 can cross the dimensions, including time.
8859601 8861194 Apparently.
8864773 8867075 Do you have the quantum data?
8867192 8869118 Roger. I have it.
8869778 8873848 I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,<br />but nothing is getting out, Cooper.
8873948 8876501 I can do this. I can do this.
8876659 8879479 But such complicated data to a child?
8879579 8880772 Not just any child.
8880872 8885259 What else? Oh, come on, Dad.
8887128 8889364 Murph, the fire's out! Come on!
8889464 8893768 Even if you communicate it here,<br />she won't understand its significance for years.
8894260 8895787 I get that, TARS.
8895887 8900625 But we've got to figure something out<br />or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!
8900725 8902377 Cooper...
8902477 8905279 they didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.
8908566 8910135 Say that again.
8910235 8913996 They didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.
8918118 8920378 No, they didn't bring us here at all.
8924707 8926876 We brought ourselves.
8935635 8939981 TARS, give me the coordinates<br />for NASA in binary.
8940223 8942984 In binary. Roger. Feeding data.
8967000 8969418 "It's not a ghost."
8970670 8972405 "It's gravity."
8972505 8974474 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8974841 8976934 I brought myself here!
8977510 8981314 We're here to communicate<br />with the three-dimensional world.
8981431 8983232 We're the bridge!
8990940 8993034 I thought they chose me.
8996070 9000041 - But they didn't choose me, they chose her.<br />- For what, Cooper?
9002243 9004212 To save the world.
9008208 9012821 All of this is one little girl's bedroom.<br />Every moment.
9012921 9014406 It's infinitely complex.
9014506 9019327 They have access to infinite time and space,<br />but they're not bound by anything!
9019427 9024398 They can't find a specific place in time.<br />They can't communicate.
9025600 9028670 That's why I'm here.<br />I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...
9028770 9030338 just like I found this moment.
9030438 9032841 - How, Cooper?<br />- Love, TARS, love.
9032941 9037429 It's just like Brand said. My connection<br />with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!
9037529 9039705 What are we here to do?
9040323 9042500 Find how to tell her.
9044994 9046629 The watch.
9049457 9050925 The watch.
9052001 9053427 That's it.
9055630 9058933 We code the data into the movement<br />of the second hand.
9062262 9065540 TARS, translate the data into Morse<br />and feed it to me.
9065640 9070236 Translating data to Morse.<br />Cooper, what if she never came back for it?
9071604 9074574 She will. She will.
9075483 9077410 Murph, I can see his car!
9078319 9079587 He's coming, Murph!
9081322 9083457 Okay. I'm coming down.
9084617 9086419 How do you know?
9089330 9091465 Because I gave it to her.
9096546 9099348 Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.
9102552 9103979 Dot-dot...
9105013 9106981 dash-dot.
9107140 9109083 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9109183 9112153 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9112353 9113922 Dash-dash-dash.
9114022 9116574 Dash, dash, dash.
9134542 9136377 He came back!
9136794 9141265 It was him all the time!<br />I didn't know. It was him!
9142050 9144310 Dad's gonna save us.
9186761 9188112 Eureka!
9191766 9193401 It's traditional.
9197689 9199615 Eureka!
9204028 9205597 Did it work?
9205697 9207832 I think it might have.
9208908 9210268 How do you know?
9210368 9214046 Because the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.
9217583 9219885 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
9220753 9222888 They're not "beings."
9223256 9224890 They're us.
9226634 9230062 What I've been doing for Murph,<br />they're doing for me.
9230304 9231873 For all of us.
9231973 9234292 Cooper, people couldn't build this.
9234392 9237045 No. No, not yet.
9237145 9238904 But one day.
9239272 9242783 Not you and me. But people.
9243151 9247496 A civilization that's evolved past<br />the four dimensions we know.
9253786 9255588 What happens now?
9317892 9319652 Mr. Cooper.
9323564 9325574 All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
9325691 9327885 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9327985 9333332 Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.<br />Actually, you are 124 years old.
9340039 9341674 Take it slow, sir.
9342291 9344819 You were... extremely lucky.
9344919 9348556 The Rangers found you with only minutes<br />left in your oxygen supply.
9362436 9364071 Where am I?
9365439 9367283 Cooper Station.
9368401 9370244 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371946 9374290 Cooper Station.
9376450 9378519 Nice of you to name it after me.
9382290 9383441 What?
9383541 9386952 The station isn't named after you, sir.<br />It's... named after your daughter.
9387253 9390323 Although she's always maintained<br />just how important you were.
9390423 9392433 Is she still alive?
9394093 9396271 She'll be here in a couple weeks.
9397013 9399540 She is far too old to be transferring<br />from another station...
9399640 9402318 but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9403227 9406038 well, this is... Murphy Cooper<br />we're talking about.
9406814 9408616 Yes, it is.
9410443 9413245 We'll have you checked out of here<br />in a couple days.
9415615 9418417 I'm sure you'll be excited to see<br />what's in store.
9419368 9423564 I actually... did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9423664 9426300 I know all about your life<br />back on Earth.
9427668 9428903 Oh, yeah.
9429003 9430554 Right.
9432673 9438312 If... If you'll follow me,<br />we've got a really good situation for you.
9441349 9445694 So... when I made my suggestion<br />to Miss Cooper...
9446312 9449606 I was delighted to hear<br />that she thought it was perfect.
9452485 9455847 It was just constant.<br />Just that steady blow of dirt.
9455947 9458933 Of course,<br />I didn't speak to her personally.
9459033 9461102 We always set the plate upside-down.
9461202 9464021 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was, upside-down.
9464121 9469110 Well, my dad was a farmer.<br />Like everybody else back then.
9469210 9471737 There just wasn't enough food.
9471837 9474615 We wore little things, little strips...
9474715 9479954 of sheet over our nose and mouth<br />so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
9480054 9483583 Well, it was pretty exciting for me<br />because it was hope.
9483683 9487962 I don't care who describes it, there is<br />no way for it to be exaggerated.
9488062 9491966 She did confirm<br />just how much you loved farming.
9492066 9495411 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah. Come here.
9495695 9500725 Home sweet home.<br />Everything replaced and put back where it...
9507039 9509150 - Hey, is this...?<br />- Oh, yeah.
9509250 9512320 The machine we found out near Saturn<br />when we found you. Yes.
9512420 9515156 Its... power source was shot,<br />but we could get you another one.
9515256 9517725 Yes. Please.
9518634 9520269 Settings.
9520428 9522229 General settings.
9522430 9524565 Security settings.
9526976 9529570 Honesty, new setting:
9530438 9532298 95 percent.
9532398 9535200 Confirmed. Additional customization?
9535776 9537202 Humor:
9538404 9540181 75 percent.
9540281 9541915 Confirmed.
9542283 9545478 Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...
9545578 9547796 Let's make that 60 percent.
9549790 9552218 Sixty percent confirmed.
9552543 9555929 - Knock-knock.<br />- You want 55?
9560509 9562936 Is this really what it was like?
9564847 9567566 It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.
9571771 9575741 I don't care much for this pretending<br />we're back where we started.
9577526 9580120 I want to know where we are.
9581447 9583290 Where we're going.
9587536 9590690 - Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.<br />- Yeah.
9590790 9591941 Family?
9592041 9596120 Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's<br />been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
9628994 9631577 You told them I like farming.
9636836 9639004 It was me, Murph.
9640965 9643058 I was your ghost.
9644051 9645978 I know.
9647471 9652251 People didn't believe me.<br />They thought that I was doing it all myself.
9652351 9653694 But...
9656272 9658732 I knew who it was.
9663195 9665664 Nobody believed me.
9665865 9668484 But I knew you'd come back.
9670870 9672379 How?
9674081 9677509 Because my dad promised me.
9683257 9685559 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9686452 9688387 I'm here.
9689346 9690881 No.
9692766 9697196 No parent should have to watch<br />their own child die.
9699815 9702984 I have my kids here for me now.
9704979 9707080 You go.
9709700 9711502 Where?
9714705 9716590 Brand.
9725933 9728260 She's out there...
9733783 9736235 setting up camp.
9762419 9764429 Alone...
9765297 9768267 in a strange galaxy.
9778852 9783824 Maybe right now<br />she's settling in for the long nap...
9801875 9805012 by the light of our new sun...
9820185 9822529 in our new home.
