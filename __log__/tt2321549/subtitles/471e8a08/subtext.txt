86211 88076 Mum!
104104 105810 Mum!
108775 110231 Mummy!
113530 114986 Mum!
117284 118319 Mum!
119453 121409 I had the dream again.
131340 137131 "And he climbed down that chimney,<br />straight into the huge black pot."
137220 140929 "And that was the end<br />of the big, bad wolf."
144770 147011 Did they really kill the wolf, mum?
147147 149559 I'm sure they did.
149691 152398 I'll kill the monster when it comes.
152486 154317 I'll smash its head in.
156782 160195 It's time to go to sleep now, sweetie.<br />It's very late.
160327 163160 Can we read it again?
166375 170459 "A long time ago, just yesterday, in fact,
170545 175005 "there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty big wolf..."
247164 249951 - What have you done?<br />- It's not broken. It just slipped.
250041 252248 I don't want you firing things off<br />in the house.
252335 255543 Watch this. When the monster comes,<br />I'm gonna do this.
256381 257461 Please don't!
260594 262880 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
263013 264469 Stand still, please.
264598 267465 - Look at me, mum.<br />- Come on, Samuel.
267559 269641 - Look at me.<br />- Stand still, please.
269770 273137 - Nothing in my hands. Nothing in my hands.<br />- I don't want you making weapons.
273273 276185 It doesn't work if you don't look at me.
276276 278392 This monster thing has got to stop,<br />all right?
292542 294157 Don't do that!
297422 299208 Ready?
300967 302173 Come on.
306973 308304 Quick. You're late already.
308433 311891 - What have you got in there?<br />- See you later, alligator!
321655 324146 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in it.
324241 326698 - What?<br />- One with your milk in it.
327619 329860 I don't want milk.
329955 331661 No worries. I'll make you another one.
335752 338334 Ah, just where a woman should be,<br />in the kitchen.
338421 341629 Hm! Get to work, woman!
341716 343206 Do you want a cuppa?
343301 345917 No. I'm heading for the dementia ward.
346012 348924 Oh, it's a few years<br />before you end up there, isn't it?
350016 351802 Right?
356565 359227 Amelia. Your son's school is on the phone.
364489 367026 Oh, my god. Did he hurt anyone?
367158 370650 A dart could have gone into a child's eye<br />or even worse.
370745 372610 I'm gonna have a serious talk with him.
372747 376831 Mrs vanek, we've had the talks.<br />We've had the sessions with the counsellor.
376918 380831 We're going to have to employ<br />a monitor for him.
382132 386876 He'll be separated from the other children.<br />The monitor will supervise him one on one.
387012 390379 Samuel won't cope with this.<br />He already feels so different.
390473 392555 I'll have a talk with him.<br />A serious talk.
392642 397386 Mrs vanek, the boy<br />has significant behavioural problems.
397480 400267 You know, Samuel doesn't need<br />a full-time monitor.
400358 402349 What he needs is some understanding.
402485 405067 I have 24 other first<br />graders in that class.
405155 407567 Do you want me to put them all at risk<br />because of your son?
407699 409485 I think I'll just find another school.
409576 411817 Mrs vanek, you can't just take the boy<br />out of school.
411912 415621 You see to your business, and I'll find a<br />school that sees my son as a human being
415707 417618 and not just another problem<br />to get rid of.
417709 420496 That's very unfair.<br />We're only trying to help the boy.
420629 423871 Please stop calling him the boy.
423965 426172 His name is Samuel.
432766 435132 We can see Ruby and auntie Claire<br />at the park today.
436353 439436 You can play on that swing you like<br />for as long as you like, ok?
440690 443102 Mrs Bowen hates me.
443193 444979 No, she doesn't.
446029 447565 You just need a break, that's all.
450200 452407 Don't tell auntie Claire what happened.
454412 455868 I'll tell her later.
458750 461241 - Mum, come and look at this.<br />- I can do it again.
463129 464960 Sam, don't bother the lady.
465048 468211 Oh, no, no, no, that's all right. We have<br />to go home and see daddy, though.
468343 471050 - My dad's in the cemetery.<br />- Oh, that's...
471179 474342 He got killed driving mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
474432 475842 Samuel.
476893 480056 - I'm sorry. He just...<br />- No, that's all right. I shouldn't have...
481523 484185 Well, your mum's very lucky<br />to have you, then, isn't she?
485026 486186 We have to go.
486277 488233 - Say, "see you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
489489 492981 The artist was so drunk, he<br />vomited in front of his own installation.
493118 494983 I ost all these sales.
495912 499370 - You're not listening.<br />- Oh, lam, I am.
499457 501914 So you lost all these sales.<br />And then what happened?
502002 503867 Ruby, don't play there. It's wet.
504004 506495 Mum! Mum!
507549 509665 I'm gonna smash its head!
511886 514719 - Be careful.<br />- Mum, mum, I'm gonna smash it.
518309 520516 What would you like me to do<br />for Wednesday?
520603 523640 I can get their birthday cakes.<br />That's easy.
525567 527933 I was hoping Ruby would change her mind.
529362 531569 She doesn't want a joint party<br />with Sam this year.
532532 534864 - Oh.<br />- Mum! Mum!
534993 538656 - She wants to have a Princess party.<br />- Mum! Mum!
538788 542451 That's ok. We don't have to come.
542584 544825 - You can still come.<br />- Mum!
544919 547376 She just doesn't wanna share the day<br />with Sam any more.
547505 549291 - I understand.<br />- Mum!
549382 553466 - I understand.<br />- Mum, I can go really high. Watch.
556431 560640 Maybe you wanna celebrate his birthday<br />properly this year, anyway... on the day.
560769 561929 Yeah, we'll see.
563229 565345 You know, Amelia,<br />I just want you to be happy,
565440 568477 then this birthday thing rolls around<br />and I end up feeling awful.
568568 570183 I don't want you to feel awful, Claire.
572030 574612 We'll be fine. We'll be absolutely fine.
574699 576360 Mum! Look at me!
582290 583655 Mummy!
589089 592001 - Who do we have here?<br />- Hello, mrs roach.
592133 596376 You look tired, little one.<br />Have you been in the wars today?
596471 598883 A few wars.
598973 602010 He's had a big day, that's all.<br />He's just exhausted.
602143 605260 - Poor little sweetheart.<br />- Bugsy.
605396 607011 Hello, darling. Hello.
608274 611482 You look tired too, love. You ok?
611569 614276 Nothing five years of sleep wouldn't fix.
614405 616191 I'll put your rubbish out for you, Gracie.
616324 618986 No, no, no. You've just got in, pet.
619077 621489 I'll do it now, then it's done.
661161 663243 You can choose one tonight.
670378 673211 - Where'd you get this?<br />- On the shelf.
679804 684673 "If it's in a word or it's in a look,<br />you can't get rid of the babadook.
687854 691722 "If you're a really clever one<br />and you know what it is to see,
691858 696192 "then you can make friends with<br />a special one, a friend of you and me."
700909 703525 "His name is mister babadook,
703620 705576 "and this is his book."
706831 710323 "A rumbling sound, then three sharp knocks.
710460 713827 "Ba ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!
714839 719424 "That's when you'll know he's around.<br />You'll see him if you look."
722639 725847 "Ba ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!"
725975 727806 We might read another one tonight, hey?
727936 729847 But you said I could choose.
735485 739228 "This is what he wears on top.<br />He's funny, don't you think?
742492 744528 "See him in your room at night..."
746871 748736 Mum, does it hurt the boy?
751251 756086 Mum? Does it live under the bed? Mum?
757131 758246 Mummy!
760218 761754 Mummy!
761886 763842 "How sweetly they sang..."
763930 768014 "Telling of the happiness<br />and loveliness at the bottom of the ocean
768101 770558 "and entreating the seals<br />not to be afraid."
840089 843547 It's that time of the night again, time...
844344 849134 - If that's what the doctor ordered...<br />- Oh, yeah. That's what the doctor ordered.
949282 951773 Mum! It's in my room!
951909 953399 - What is?<br />- The babadook!
953536 958326 Oh, no. No, no, no.<br />This is not going to happen.
958416 961453 The closet doors were closed,<br />and now they're wide open.
961586 965750 It's just a book. It can't hurt you.
967216 971050 You've had a big day.<br />You're just exhausted.
973181 976048 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, mum.
978895 981261 Nothing bad's gonna happen, Sam.
982815 984305 I'm gonna protect you.
1055137 1057128 Mum, it's nine o'clock.
1068776 1071267 He's not running a fever any more.
1071362 1074650 No, no, no, my sister's going to take him.<br />Put it back.
1074782 1077740 Put it back or it goes in the bin.
1077868 1079904 Sorry. What was that?
1080955 1084322 Oh, no, no, I couldn't get to the phone.<br />He was vomiting.
1084417 1086499 Yeah, yeah, no worries. [I'll see you soon.
1086586 1089578 Samuel, no monster talk<br />at auntie Claire's, ok?
1090840 1094833 Samuel. No babadook, no nothing.<br />All right?
1102685 1107054 88. Number 88. Two fat ladies...
1107189 1111432 Good, Elaine. Another few days<br />and someone could call out bingo.
1114989 1117947 Number 11. Who has number 117?
1118075 1120031 Legs 11.
1120161 1122903 Ok. Let's see what else we've got.
1125916 1129659 Five billion. Anyone got five billion?
1141307 1144549 Beverly's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1147229 1148639 Are you all right?
1148731 1150767 Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.
1150858 1152598 How are you? How's g wing?
1152693 1155309 Fine, yeah, just a bunch of old people.
1158574 1160656 You don't have to be fine, you know?
1162244 1164075 Just a bit stressed at the moment.
1164205 1165945 Why don't you go home?
1168167 1172035 Old cranky bitch, she goes after lunch.<br />I can cover for you.
1172129 1174120 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
1176717 1179550 - I'll give you my pay.<br />- Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
1181180 1183842 You've got a sick boy. Life's too short.
1184684 1186675 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1188938 1191270 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1191357 1193518 - Say hi to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
1244785 1246446 Where have you been?
1246579 1248911 You weren't at work.<br />I've rung you a million times.
1249039 1251906 - What happened?<br />- He scared the crap out of Ruby, that's all.
1252001 1254458 He insisted on talking<br />to this bloody babadook thing.
1254587 1257420 All day, just talking to the air.<br />Even freaked me out.
1257548 1259568 - I'm so sorry.<br />- You need to get him to see someone.
1259592 1261833 It's not normal for a kid<br />to carry on with this rubbish.
1261969 1263334 It's not rubbish. It's real!
1263471 1265507 Don't you talk<br />to your auntie Claire like that!
1268267 1271805 - Where did you get those firecrackers?<br />- You got them for me on the Internet.
1271937 1274679 Well, that's the end of the Internet.
1275775 1278437 If the babadook was real,<br />we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?
1278527 1282065 It wants to scare you first.<br />Then you'll see it.
1282198 1283938 Well, I'm not scared.
1284033 1286991 You will be<br />when it creeps into your room at night.
1287119 1288734 That's enough.
1288829 1291286 You will be when it eats your insides.
1291415 1293872 I've decided you're not having<br />your birthday with Ruby.
1293959 1295699 No cake, no games, that's the end of it.
1300758 1302373 Samuel!
1311435 1315394 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />mum and dad.
1315523 1318060 Life is not always as it seems!
1318192 1321309 It can be a wondrous thing!
1322404 1325862 But it can also be very treacherous.
1333916 1337158 Don't worry, dad, I'll save mum.
1337294 1340161 I'm gonna trap the babadook like this.
1343884 1346341 When it's trapped, I'm gonna kill it!
1346428 1348384 Samuel?
1357815 1360978 - I was putting something back.<br />- All your father's things are down there.
1361068 1364185 He's my father! You don't own him!
1366615 1368947 Just thought I'd see how you were going.
1372162 1374244 Can I come in?
1374373 1377365 Hey, Matey. This is for you.
1377501 1380459 My mum always got me a model plane<br />when I was sick.
1380546 1381706 I'm not sick.
1383340 1385877 Oh. I... I thought...
1385968 1388630 No, he's not, actually.<br />The truth is, he's so disobedient,
1388721 1391258 - he can't go to school any more.<br />- You said that's not true!
1391348 1394135 How many six-year-old boys do you know<br />who still believe in monsters?
1394268 1399934 I hate you! She won't let me have a birthday<br />party and she won't let me have a dad!
1466840 1468705 Oh.
1474181 1476046 Don't eat it.
1487861 1489726 The babadook did it, mum.
1491031 1492987 Go and watch a DVD.<br />I'll make something else.
1493117 1496325 - The babadook did it!<br />- Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.
1496453 1501038 Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys.
1501125 1506916 Welcome to the great Martin's<br />DVD school of magic.
1507006 1509588 Life is not always as it seems.
1509717 1513084 It can be a wondrous thing.
1514471 1517463 But it can also be very treacherous.
1518726 1522264 On this DVD, you will learn magic tricks
1522354 1524970 to surprise, to delight
1525065 1531231 and perhaps even shock<br />your family and friends.
1553886 1556002 Do you think this is funny?
1557681 1559842 Oh, no. No, no.
1561977 1563467 Give it to me!
1564188 1565894 Aaah!
1566023 1568059 Do you wanna die?
1621078 1627199 Mum! Mum! Mum!
1627292 1632002 Mum! Mum! Mum!
1634299 1636210 Mum! Mum!
1640931 1644014 Don't let it in!<br />Don't letitin! Don't let it in!
1644143 1648307 Don't let it in! Don't let it in!<br />Don't let it in!
1719343 1722426 Mum, do we have<br />to go to Ruby's party?
1733148 1735480 I've already got this doll, mum.
1735609 1738066 Well, now she's got a twin.<br />They can go shopping together.
1742950 1745316 Off you go.
1746161 1748743 He's just really tired.
1752793 1754875 Go and play right now.
1762386 1764172 Claire tells me you're a writer.
1764304 1767967 Oh. No, not really, not any more.
1768058 1769389 What kind of writing did you do?
1769518 1773386 I wrote some articles for some magazines<br />and did some kids' stuff.
1773522 1775763 You just need to get back into it,<br />that's all.
1775899 1777855 It must be difficult.
1777943 1780605 I do volunteer work<br />with some disadvantaged women
1780696 1784985 and a few of them have lost their husbands,<br />and they find it very hard.
1788412 1790323 How's Richard's merger going?
1790414 1794373 Oh, good.<br />I mean, his workload's just ballooned.
1794459 1797201 - I've got the kids 24-7, it feels like.<br />- Tell me about it.
1797296 1800083 I don't even have time to go to the gym<br />any more. It's ridiculous.
1800173 1801834 That's a real tragedy.
1802843 1805710 Not having time to go to the gym any more?<br />How do you cope?
1805804 1810093 You must have so much to talk about<br />with those poor disadvantaged women.
1821361 1824103 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1824197 1825562 I'm not hurting anybody.
1828618 1829903 Bye.
1832164 1834325 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks.
1837836 1839872 What are you doing? Hey!
1840005 1843873 How would your mum know if it's real<br />or not? She never comes to our house.
1843967 1848301 Mum told dad she didn't want to go<br />to your house cos it's too depressing.
1848430 1851388 The babadook<br />would eat your mum for breakfast.
1851475 1853807 - It'd rip her arms off.<br />- Shut up!
1853935 1856347 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1856438 1859430 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can't cope.
1859524 1861981 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1862110 1864852 - Isn't it time you moved on?<br />- I have moved on.
1865947 1870611 I don't mention him. I don't talk about<br />him. What strain is that on you, Claire?
1870744 1873360 You're not even good enough to have a dad.
1873497 1875408 Everyone else has one and you don't.
1875540 1877121 I do have a dad.
1877250 1879707 I listen to your life, day in, day out,
1879795 1883128 and you never stop to ask me<br />anything about mine.
1883215 1887299 - 1 do. I want to know how you are.<br />- You don't come to our house any more.
1887427 1889918 Because I can't stand<br />being around your son.
1891139 1892800 I can't believe you just said that.
1892891 1895098 You can't stand<br />being around him yourself.
1895227 1897593 Your dad died<br />so he didn't have to be with you.
1897687 1900303 - That's not true!<br />- And your mum doesn't want you.
1901650 1903231 - No one wants you.<br />- Ah!
1913954 1916491 - What did you do?<br />- She said I didn't have a dad.
1916623 1918909 She kept saying it.
1920210 1921575 Is she all right?
1921670 1923581 Stay here and look after the children!
1923713 1925624 Do you want another one to get hurt?
1926800 1930713 Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!
1930846 1933428 Mummy! Mummy!
1933515 1936177 Mummy! Mummy!
1936309 1939142 - Mummy!<br />- Why can't you just be normal?
1940856 1943017 There is no babadook!
1946319 1947525 Get out!
1950407 1952363 - Get out!<br />- Samuel?
1952492 1953652 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now.
1953785 1957528 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1960292 1963580 Mum! Mum! Mum!
1976766 1980133 Please help me!<br />There's something wrong with my son!
1992908 1995149 I think it may have been<br />a febrile convulsion.
1995243 1998406 That's when the brain overheats.<br />It always looks worse than it is.
1998497 2000203 I've never seen anything like this.
2000290 2004624 We'll have to wait until the tests come<br />back. All his other results are normal.
2004711 2008329 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety.
2008465 2012583 - Very committed to the monster theory.<br />- That's an understatement.
2013720 2017008 - All children see monsters.<br />- Not like this.
2019601 2023093 And it's getting worse.<br />He's becoming aggressive.
2023230 2026313 He can see a psychiatrist. I can refer you.
2026441 2029023 - It takes a few weeks to get in.<br />- That'd be great.
2031154 2037070 But can you just give me something for now,<br />just... to make him sleep?
2038078 2040034 Just until...
2040997 2043033 Just until we can get an appointment.
2045377 2051293 Please. I haven't slept in weeks, and...<br />And neither has Samuel.
2051383 2054420 And when we go home tonight,<br />this whole nightmare will start up again
2054511 2058754 and I'm really... I'm really not coping.
2062143 2068605 I can give you a short course of sedatives,<br />just until the tests come back.
2068692 2073527 Most mothers aren't too keen on them<br />unless it's really bad.
2073613 2076025 It's really bad.
2082914 2089160 These can make children feel foggy,<br />perhaps some temporary nausea.
2090046 2092207 They'll certainly help him sleep, though.
2093592 2095753 - That's for one week.<br />- Thank you.
2098805 2102389 - Why don't people like me?<br />- Why do you say that?
2102517 2106101 Ruby said people don't like me<br />cos I'm weird.
2108607 2111690 Sometimes people say things<br />that aren't true.
2116239 2120573 You just need to take your medicine,<br />have a big sleep and not worry.
2122162 2123823 I don't want you to die.
2123955 2127447 I'm not gonna die for a long time yet.
2127542 2131251 Did you think that about my dad<br />before he died?
2136217 2139004 Just take your pill so you can go to sleep.
2140347 2143339 I've got the day off tomorrow.<br />Maybe we could do something.
2144309 2146721 Will these make the babadook go away?
2146853 2150345 I think so. But you have to promise me<br />not to mention it again.
2151149 2154983 I promise to protect you<br />if you promise to protect me.
2155070 2157561 Then I won't mention it.
2157656 2161695 I promise to protect you. Come on.
2174089 2175829 Come on.
2181763 2184379 Can you stay here with me?
2184474 2185589 Yes.
2187185 2189050 I love you, mum.
2189145 2190806 Me too.
2372245 2375362 Her nose is broken in two places.<br />She's gonna need surgery.
2375456 2378573 - I'll pay for everything.<br />- You can't even pay your own bills.
2378668 2379874 Look, I really have to go.
2379961 2383920 Claire, I think someone<br />is stalking me and Samuel.
2384007 2385463 What?
2385550 2388087 A book turned up at our place.
2388177 2392341 I threw it away, but somebody glued it<br />back together and put it on our doorstep.
2392432 2396050 Amelia...<br />I just can't help you right now.
2396144 2398476 I don't expect you to help.<br />I... I just wanted...
2398563 2401771 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2401858 2403314 I have to go.
2422629 2424620 Claire?
2426674 2428335 Hello?
2430428 2437220 Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!
2445443 2451109 Hi. I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2451240 2453697 - Can you tell us what happened?<br />- Somebody sent me...
2453785 2455400 A children's book.
2458414 2459494 And...
2460708 2464701 And it contained violent and graphic images<br />of my child and me being murdered.
2464837 2466702 Can we have a look at the book, please?
2467674 2468959 I burnt it.
2470551 2472792 - You burnt it.<br />- Yes.
2472929 2476467 Well, unfortunately,<br />there's nothing we can do about it.
2478267 2480804 He's been making phone calls<br />to me as well.
2480895 2482101 What's he been saying?
2482188 2485931 Nothing. He's just making these... noises.
2486067 2487773 How do you know it's the same person?
2487902 2490188 Because of what he wrote in the book.
2490321 2491982 The book you burnt?
2493616 2495231 Yes.
2510842 2514460 Ok. Don't worry about it.
2524731 2527063 Did you get your things done?
2527150 2530734 Mrs roach has Parkinson's.<br />That's why she shakes like this.
2530820 2534733 Samuel, you don't have to say everything<br />that goes through your head.
2534824 2537861 Oh, it's all right, love.
2537994 2541612 He wanted to know, so we talked about it.
2541748 2544455 He sees things as they are, that one.
2544542 2547750 Oskar was the same.<br />He always spoke his mind.
2547837 2550579 Do you have to keep on bringing him up?
2556679 2559295 Hey, bugsy.
2578493 2580575 Ugh!
2630002 2631583 Don't come in here.
2644976 2646386 I don't wanna buy anything.
2646519 2649511 - Are you Amelia vanek?<br />- Yes.
2649647 2651854 I'm Warren Newton<br />and this is Prue flannery,
2651941 2653897 from the department<br />of community services.
2654026 2655857 My son's only been away for two days.
2655945 2659483 He's not actually registered<br />at babbage bay any more.
2659615 2662732 If I could just come in and meet Samuel<br />and get you to look at these papers,
2662827 2664863 that'd be great.
2665746 2669489 I'm just in the middle<br />of cleaning up the house at the moment.
2671043 2674331 I'm sorry. There's stuff everywhere.
2678050 2682965 Hello, Samuel.<br />I'm Prue and this is Warren.
2684599 2685964 How are you?
2686100 2689684 I'm a bit tired from the drugs<br />mum gave me.
2689812 2692599 Not drugs. Tranquillisers.
2692690 2696433 From the doctor. He had a fit yesterday.
2696527 2700190 - I'm really tired, actually.<br />- That's no good.
2703868 2705824 May I have a glass of water, please?
2706746 2709488 Yes, of course. I'll get you one.
2717882 2721215 It's a real mess.<br />I just found this cockroach infestation.
2721302 2725591 I normally have the house sprayed, I did<br />actually already have it sprayed, but...
2725723 2729386 There's this hole in the wall<br />behind the fridge and that's why I...
2734315 2739309 I didn't mean a hole in the wall.<br />There was a hole in the wallpaper.
2739403 2742236 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2742323 2745656 We've caught you at a bad time.
2745785 2747741 I'll leave you with this.
2747828 2751241 We're required to come back in a week<br />to talk through your options.
2752166 2754031 Here's my card.
2755461 2757497 Mum!
2757588 2759499 I think I'm gonna vomit.
2779527 2782644 What was that noise I heard?
2782780 2787069 - I didn't hear any noise.<br />- Howling, doors slamming.
2787159 2790196 I declare,<br />Bonnie thinks this house is haunted.
2790329 2791785 Mum.
2791914 2793950 I'm gonna go to bed.
2794083 2798873 - Are you sick?<br />- Oh, no...
2799005 2801371 It's only six o'clock.
2801465 2803672 Don't you wanna stay up<br />with your mum for a while?
2803801 2805166 No.
2805303 2808261 If you go to bed now,<br />the pills won't work properly.
2813102 2815434 You have to stay up for<br />a while, sweetheart.
2830578 2833911 Where's its mother, skip?<br />Koalas don't leave their babies about.
2834832 2837244 - Hey, you off now, then?<br />- Yep, soon as I fuel up.
2837335 2839021 Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch on the radio.
2839045 2841286 I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2844133 2847170 "And the prince and the Princess<br />lived happily together
2847261 2850970 "in a beautiful palace<br />for the rest of their days."
2954702 2961744 Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!
2996869 2999030 Where are we going?
2999121 3000702 We're going downstairs.
3000789 3002871 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
3021727 3024560 Iris, Iris, Iris.
3024688 3026349 No.
3074989 3077401 Glass and mirror attachment.
3077491 3080654 Clean and Polish shower doors or mirrors<br />for a streak-free shine.
3080744 3084487 As part of this special, we'll even<br />include the garment and upholst...
3086083 3088290 I don't wanna give it to anyone at work.
3090796 3094004 All right, give all my shifts away.<br />That's just what I need.
3096260 3099343 I can't help it if I'm sick.<br />What do you expect me to do?
3100264 3101720 You do that!
3117323 3121111 Mum, I took the pills,<br />but I feel sick again.
3123454 3125536 I need to eat something.
3130669 3133160 I couldn't find any food in the fridge.
3135966 3138082 You said to have them with food.
3139970 3142131 I'm really hungry, mum.
3142222 3146431 Why do you have to keep talk-talk-talking?
3146518 3148759 Don't you ever stop?
3149980 3153063 - I was just...<br />- I need to sleep.
3153150 3155812 I'm sorry, mummy,<br />I was just really hungry.
3155903 3158736 If you're that hungry,<br />why don't you go and eat shit?
3193482 3199352 I'm so sorry. I don't know why I said that.<br />That was terrible.
3199488 3205404 I've had absolutely no sleep.<br />I didn't know what I was saying.
3207204 3209286 I'll cook you something, eh?
3210624 3212239 What would you like?
3212334 3214074 I'm not hungry any more.
3220968 3222674 We really need to get out of this house.
3222803 3226011 We've been cooped up here too long,<br />that's the problem.
3230561 3233177 Do you want to go to Wally's?
3233272 3236480 You can have anything you want, all right?
3236567 3239274 Even ice cream for breakfast if you like.
3241655 3245147 Give it back now. Give it back.
3245242 3248109 Stop it. Sit down. Sit down.
3248203 3249488 - No!<br />- Now.
3249580 3251821 - Give my drink back.<br />- Sit down, please.
3258756 3260838 Where are we going?
3260924 3262835 I just wanna drive for a little while.
3275731 3276891 Aah!
3277024 3279811 Mummy! Mummy!
3279943 3282685 Babadook!
3294875 3296615 You ran straight into me!
3296710 3300248 I just bought this bloody car.<br />What were you thinking?
3301632 3304044 Driving on the wrong side of the road<br />with a kid in the back!
3304176 3306007 You could have killed someone!
3307763 3310596 Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
3310724 3311930 Hey! Crazy bitch!
3318649 3321015 Hi, sweetheart.
3329159 3330695 Mum?
3332746 3335328 I can call auntie Claire.
3337626 3340413 I can call and she can come over.
3344341 3346002 Mum?
3347010 3349843 Auntie Claire doesn't wanna<br />talk to us any more.
3351682 3354845 Mum? Mum, look at me.
3381128 3383414 It's nice and warm in here.
3387342 3389378 I don't want you to go away.
3391680 3393716 I'm not going anywhere.
3406320 3407901 Mum?
3415412 3419576 Mum, I don't think<br />we should stay here tonight.
3421001 3422957 I can call mrs roach.
3424046 3426128 I don't want you to call anyone.
3430093 3432175 I just need to sleep.
3436767 3438758 - Mum...<br />- Leave it!
3469675 3472007 Something in the house.
3486942 3489684 There is someone in the house!
3545792 3548204 Can we come and stay the night?
3557345 3559176 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3559264 3563132 Has someone broken into the house?<br />Sam said that...
3563226 3566639 No, no, no. We're fine.<br />Samuel's just being very disobedient again.
3566730 3568812 Oh. I was so worried.
3568940 3572023 - I told him not to call anyone.<br />- He asked if you could stay the night.
3572110 3575102 No, no, no, we're fine.<br />I just have a headache, that's all.
3575238 3578651 - I really have to go, though, now, Gracie.<br />- Uh...
3578742 3581734 - I'm so sorry for troubling you.<br />- Yes. Talk soon?
3581828 3584194 No worries. Talk soon.
3586708 3590451 I told you not to call anyone<br />and you deliberately disobeyed me.
3591588 3594375 Do you wanna frighten mrs roach?
3594466 3597879 An old lady who can hardly walk.<br />Do you wanna make her sick?
3600305 3602261 Get that bloody thing off!
3606561 3612431 Is this the only way I can trust you not<br />to embarrass me in front of our neighbours?
3617739 3619980 Is this what I have to do?
3630168 3633752 I'm sorry, mummy. It's just that the<br />babadook made you crash the car,
3633880 3635711 - and then...<br />- What did you say?
3635841 3639049 - I said the babadook...<br />- The babadook isn't real, Samuel.
3639177 3642840 It's just something you've made up<br />in your stupid little head.
3642973 3645430 I just didn't want you to let it in!
3645559 3650724 I'll make sure nothing gets in tonight,<br />all right, Samuel?
3650856 3653222 Nothing is coming in here tonight.
3653358 3655770 Nothing!
3692272 3694479 I feel sick.
3694608 3698851 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3698987 3700477 Mum, I don't think I need...
3700614 3703572 I am the parent and you are the child,<br />so take the pill.
3727599 3729214 Good boy.
3752082 3753242 Mum!
3770600 3773933 Hey, bugsy. Hey, sweetie.
3776314 3778646 Come here, sweetie.
3779859 3781440 Hey.
3782404 3783769 Hey.
3805552 3807543 Here we go.
3812434 3814766 There's more where that came from.
3828325 3830816 Decide, or we all die!
3833163 3834243 What's the secret...
3837584 3840041 - Letter of Max's.<br />- Not for a minute.
3840128 3842335 Don't lie.<br />You called me a jezebel. Why?
3842422 3844208 - The north...<br />- Natural corset...
3844341 3846548 With fresh meat...
3848136 3849967 Only five in a...
3851014 3853380 You don't wanna go in there<br />all by yourself, do you?
3855393 3859227 Police say the woman<br />used a kitchen knife to stab her son.
3859356 3861688 His body was found in their basement.
3861775 3864767 The woman later attacked officers<br />with the knife.
3864861 3868399 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3868531 3870362 Little is known about the tragedy,
3870492 3874610 but neighbours say the boy<br />was celebrating his birthday today.
3874704 3876740 He had just turned seven.
3891846 3893882 Samuel.
3897227 3899513 Wake up, mummy.
3902440 3904806 But you're the one who's asleep,<br />sweetheart.
3910407 3912648 Don't go down there.
3917080 3918536 It's not safe.
3956995 3959077 I thought you were dead.
3960331 3962413 I thought you were dead.
3977265 3979347 We can be together.
3981519 3983601 You just need to bring me the boy.
4006252 4008584 You mean Samuel?
4008713 4011625 You can bring me the boy.
4013218 4015209 You can bring me the boy.
4017222 4020214 - You can bring me the boy.<br />- Stop calling him the boy.
4020308 4024221 - I think it's going to rain.<br />- No.
4024312 4026849 No. No.
4116904 4118986 It isn't real, it isn't<br />real, it isn't real.
4132045 4133410 Oh, no.
4134422 4135628 Oh, no.
4139010 4140750 No.
4146476 4147761 No!
4148853 4150889 Bugsy.
4261841 4263422 Samuel!
4269599 4270714 Samuel.
4274061 4276268 Bugsy's hurt and we need to get help.
4279400 4281812 You don't want him to die, do you?
4285782 4289400 Samuel, are you listening to me?
4294665 4296701 Let me in, you little shit!
4298044 4302413 Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
4302507 4304293 Let me in!
4327657 4329238 You little pig.
4330368 4333610 Six years old<br />and you're still wetting yourself.
4333746 4339707 You don't know how many times<br />I wished it was you, not him, that died.
4339836 4341451 I just want you to be happy.
4341587 4343873 "I just want you to be happy.”
4348052 4353763 Sometimes I just wanna smash your head<br />against a brick wall
4353850 4356512 until your fucking brains pop out.
4356644 4358600 You're not my mother.
4358729 4360310 What did you say?
4360398 4362855 I said you're not my mother!
4362984 4365942 I am your mother!
4369198 4372656 Run, run, run, as fast as you can!
4376247 4379284 - Get away!<br />- Didn't I tell you not to play with weapons?
4379417 4381453 Ow!
4427882 4432842 I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.<br />I just wanted to make sure you were ok.
4434388 4435844 I'm ok.
4437141 4442431 I know this time of year's<br />terribly hard for you.
4442521 4446264 And I know you don't want me<br />to go on about it, so I won't.
4446359 4451319 I just wanted you to know<br />that I'd do anything for you and Sam.
4451447 4453483 I love you both.
4456494 4457984 Samuel.
4461582 4462992 I'm sorry.
4466170 4467751 I understand you're scared.
4469423 4472790 I haven't been good since your dad died.
4472885 4474967 I haven't been good at all.
4477807 4480924 I'm sick, Sam. I need help.
4486107 4488189 I just spoke with mrs roach.
4490987 4493069 We're gonna stay there tonight.
4495449 4497314 Do you want that?
4501789 4503871 I wanna make it up to you, Sam.
4515386 4517217 I want you to meet your dad.
4519724 4521589 It's beautiful there.
4523853 4525764 You'll be happy.
4532528 4534234 Sorry, mummy!
4583287 4587280 Mum! Mum!
4587416 4589532 I'm not leaving you.
4593130 4595371 Mum. Mum.
4602389 4605472 We said we'd protect each other.
4609563 4613727 I know you don't love me.
4614902 4617018 The babadook won't let you.
4617863 4620320 But I love you, mum.
4621325 4623111 And I always will.
4632795 4636879 You let it in! You have to get it out!
4641053 4642793 I don't want you to go away.
4643889 4647598 No! No! No! Mummy!
4697818 4700230 Mummy!
4700321 4704314 Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
4704408 4706023 Mummy!
4706118 4709326 Mummy! Mummy!
4747701 4750534 - What is it?<br />- You can't get rid of the babadook.
4768472 4770884 Ow!
4781402 4783438 What do you want?
4785990 4787196 What do you want?
4825487 4827148 No.
4828282 4830364 Keep breathing.
4833454 4836617 Put your seat back, sweetheart.<br />Ten more minutes and we're there.
4841712 4843828 No.
4847760 4849250 I think it's gonna rain.
4849386 4851251 Stop!
4899978 4901718 You are nothing.
4925003 4927369 This is my house!
4931427 4934669 You are trespassing in my house!
4945357 4949350 If you touch my son again,<br />I'll fucking kill you!
5004249 5007082 Mummy, don't!
5012090 5013546 Don't!
5120157 5122273 Watch out for your mum's leg, little one.
5122409 5124274 He's fine. I've had the stitches out.
5124411 5127448 - What time's the party?<br />- Any time after three is fine.
5127581 5129321 I'll see you in a few hours, then.
5129458 5132541 Bye. Bye, Sam.
5133420 5135081 That school's a good choice.
5135213 5139047 I've been doing a lot of reading about it,<br />so I think Sam'll be happy there.
5139134 5142718 He's been out of school over two weeks<br />now. It's time to get back.
5143513 5146175 We needed some time<br />to sort a few things out.
5148143 5151055 - Are you having a party?<br />- It's Sam's birthday today.
5151188 5154601 My first birthday I've ever celebrated.
5154691 5158559 - That's not true.<br />- Yes, it is. My first party on the day.
5158695 5160856 That's unusual.
5164034 5166650 My husband died the day<br />that Sam was born.
5166787 5169950 He got killed driving mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
5172167 5176206 Sam's just like his dad was,<br />always speaks his mind.
5176338 5180547 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
5180676 5185386 My cousin's not coming<br />because I broke her nose in two places.
5188684 5189764 I'll take that for you.
5209371 5211362 Good shot!
5211456 5213913 I ook. There's another one.
5214000 5215865 Where's your bowl?
5218880 5221246 Wow. You've got a lot today.
5222926 5224917 Am I ever gonna see it?
5226054 5228136 One day, when you're bigger.
5234604 5237971 You go outside,<br />and you don't come in until I tell you.
5283737 5287901 It's all right.<br />It's all right. It's all right.
5287991 5290448 Shh.
5291870 5293326 Shh, shh, shh.
5295040 5296576 Shh.
5297626 5299287 Shh, shh, shh.
5301171 5302877 Shh.
5323985 5327443 - How was it?<br />- It was quiet today.
5330116 5331981 Come here.
5335288 5337324 It's getting much better, mum.
5341920 5343660 Wait.
5343755 5345837 I have a new trick.
5348635 5351752 Life is not always as it seems.
5351847 5354589 Nothing in my hands, nothing in my hands.
5359479 5362687 - That's great!<br />- I haven't finished.
5372534 5375276 Abracadabra!
5377831 5379492 How did you do that?
5385380 5387996 Come here, you. Come here.
5398810 5400846 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
