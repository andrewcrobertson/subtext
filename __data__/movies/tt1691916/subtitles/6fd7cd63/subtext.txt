63985 65825 Maybe for you<br />there's a tomorrow.
78249 83249 Maybe for you<br />there's 1,000 or 3,000
85465 86675 or 10.
99479 101849 So much time<br />you can bathe in it.
108321 110151 So much time<br />you can waste it.
116788 118658 But for some of us,
119665 122085 there's only today.
122168 124168 And what you do today matters.
125630 129460 In the moment,<br />and maybe into infinity.
136933 140983 But I didn't know any of that<br />until right before I fell.
146067 148787 The thing is,<br />you don't get to know.
149612 151822 You don't wake up with a bad<br />feeling in your stomach
151906 153406 or see shadows move.
154408 159118 If you're like me, you wake<br />up 24 minutes and 47 seconds
159205 162085 before your best friend is<br />supposed to be picking you up.
163668 164668 If you're like me,
165962 167542 your last day starts like this.
188428 194021 Sync by: @Aren.zo
216721 218511 Well, I'll let you know by noon.
219515 221515 Well, I can't organize<br />a playdate before...
221601 223271 You want something to eat?<br />No. I'm good.
224353 226103 Sammy, you like<br />the bird I made you?
227440 228650 Morning.
231611 232651 Sammy!<br />What?
232778 234148 You forgot your gloves!
234405 236285 Izzy, how many times<br />do I have to tell you?
236407 237457 Don't touch my stuff.
238951 240281 Go back inside.<br />It's cold.
248085 249835 Hey, sexy. Get in!
249921 250921 Okay.
259555 261395 I love the sky<br />on mornings like this.
262016 263016 Hey.
263517 265317 Greasy forehead, window, off.
268481 270101 I'm gonna try<br />not to be depressed
270191 271731 because I'm single on Cupid Day.
271943 274033 That's Valentine's Day to you!
275529 277090 Do you have insomnia<br />or something, Linds?
277114 278154 Excuse me?
278240 280560 It's just cute that you get up<br />before us and get breakfast.
280701 282741 Ooh. Did she just<br />call me cute, Kingston?
282995 284545 I believe she did, Edgecomb.<br />Mmm-mmm.
284664 288044 Al, Linds doesn't do "cute." No.
288125 291135 It's not in her lexicon.<br />Lexicon? Nice word choice.
295883 297013 Whoo!
297176 298556 Come on.
306394 307394 Seriously?
307853 310853 Okay, this was maybe funny the<br />first bazillion times you did it.
311816 313066 It's still funny.<br />It still is.
313275 314865 Still funny!<br />Love it. Every time.
318489 319649 Yeah, baby!
323995 325375 No texting and driving.
325454 329004 Don't worry. I'd never let<br />my best friend die a virgin.
329250 330500 Ooh!
330793 332104 You didn't think<br />we'd forget, did you?
332128 334588 It's the big day, opening night.
335047 338177 Rob texted me. He said,<br />"I made my bed for you."
339385 340685 That is so sweet.<br />Yes.
340845 343685 No glove, no love.<br />You hear me?
344390 346640 Take it!<br />Take it! Take it!
346767 348078 Take it!<br />Take it! Take it! Take it!
348102 349312 Shh! Okay, okay...
350021 351540 - Watch the road. Oh, my God.<br />- Lindsay!
351564 353125 All right. I'm sorry.<br />We're fine. We're fine.
353149 354189 You're crazy!
354275 355585 We're freakin' fine.
355609 357449 Go ahead and say we're through
357820 359780 I don't care,<br />I'll just get another you
359864 361824 I'll get another dude<br />that look like you
361949 364094 I don't<br />need you and you don't need me
364118 365408 Give me back my house key
366245 368375 You can leave it<br />with my new boyfriend
368456 371166 You can leave it on the back<br />back, back porch
371333 373253 I don't care, when you<br />leave it leave a message
373335 374635 A message, a message, a message
374712 376252 You used to never<br />get the message
376338 377548 Yeah, I talk shit
377631 378671 Yeah, she's talkin' shit
378758 379958 Go ahead and say we're through
380593 382343 I don't care<br />I'll just get another you
382428 384258 I'll get another dude<br />that look like you
384346 386516 I don't need you<br />and you don't need me
386599 387969 Give me back my house key
388059 389349 My house key My house key
395191 397401 This could be easy
400821 403241 This could be easy
406452 409122 This could be easy
412124 414834 This could be easy
424095 426015 How many roses did you<br />get last year, Linds?
426430 427640 Twenty-two.
427723 429513 I'm going for 25<br />this year, though,
429600 432060 and more than one of them<br />better be from Patrick.
433104 435064 Did I tell you<br />I sat next to Rob,
435147 438067 and I had to make him fill<br />out the request form?
438275 439485 It was depressing.
440319 443529 I'd be happy with 15. I'm<br />not ashamed to admit it.
444824 447164 Last year, Matt literally<br />sent me a dozen red roses.
447243 449873 Matt, oh, come on.
449954 451914 You just spent<br />a whole week crying
451997 454217 in the same pair of<br />sweatpants and it got dark.
454625 455685 We're not going back there.
455709 459249 No, I've told you a thousand<br />times, I'll say it again,
460381 462921 you do not need<br />that loser. Honestly.
463050 465380 Mmm-mmm. Nope. You got<br />your real baes here.
465469 467299 Mmm-hmm. We love you. Come here.
467763 470263 Till death do us part.<br />Even then.
470432 472182 Oh, get in here.
472309 474429 Mmm.
474520 475760 All right, bitches, let's move!
480025 482575 Sisyphus, not an STD.
484655 485865 What's he like?
486907 490707 What does it mean when something<br />is described as being Sisyphean?
491662 494082 Does it mean pointless?
495457 496667 Brave?
498627 499637 Late?
499962 502252 Uh, sorry, it was an<br />emergency and a tribulation.
503841 506511 It was a minor<br />LaserJet explosion.
506844 507974 Hope the printer survived.
509722 511142 All right, back to Sisyphus.
512057 513107 What's his character like?
513434 515524 Does he learn from<br />pushing that boulder...
516854 517854 Hey.
517938 518938 Val-a-gram delivery.
522943 524533 Happy Cupid Day.<br />Go ahead.
538876 540716 Relax, it's just roses.
541420 543170 Aw, no roses for Anna.
544006 545056 Is that from your boy?
545132 546382 It's from Rob. Yeah.
546634 549134 All right, all right. Keep it down.<br />Keep it down, people.
555017 556437 It's so beautiful.
560731 562441 I'm in heteronormative hell.
569365 571955 Okay, okay, let's<br />hope third time's the charm. Okay?
572993 573993 Sisyphus.
577539 579539 Back to Sisyphus, class.
581961 583331 Yo, Sam.<br />Hey.
588467 589517 Man.
591262 592802 Sam, hey.<br />Hi.
593681 595051 Did you like it?<br />Like what?
595516 597566 Hey, so, um, big party tonight.
597643 599353 Mom is going out of town. Whoa.
599436 601986 A huge rager, you know.<br />Why don't you come, yeah?
602064 603208 I don't know what my plans are,
603232 604459 like, what everyone else<br />ends up doing...
604483 605752 So I'll see you tonight.<br />I don't think so.
605776 607406 Yeah? You know the address.<br />No. Kent...
608279 609279 Smooth.
628173 630110 - Did you guys hear about Anna?<br />- You mean bull dyke.
630134 631764 Please say she tripped<br />over her nose.
632219 634339 Not yet, but her<br />girlfriend saw this Snap
634430 635910 that we posted<br />with her and that girl.
636223 637973 She straight up dumped her.
638225 639225 See?<br />What?
639310 641980 This is why I deserve<br />some public recognition,
642062 643562 for making shit<br />like that happen.
643897 645567 Maybe someone should<br />give me a ribbon.
645941 648321 Like the ones that you used<br />to have hanging on your wall,
648402 650282 Sammy, remember,<br />from horseback riding?
650446 652036 I was, like,<br />ten years old, Lindsay.
652114 653994 God, Sam, you were<br />such a nerd back then.
654033 656413 Okay, but isn't it weird<br />how that stuff happens?
656493 657853 How things connect<br />in strange ways?
657911 659306 Like if Lindsay<br />didn't post that Snap...
659330 660330 She deserved it.
660456 661936 I'm just saying,<br />it's kinda crazy now.
662291 664751 I saw this video about chaos<br />in the universe... Listen!
664835 667215 How a bird flapping its<br />wings in South America
667296 668926 can create a major<br />rainstorm in New York.
669089 672009 Like how one person can watch a<br />pretentious video about chaos
672092 674842 while three other people<br />actually die of boredom.
674928 677488 It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so<br />you guys wouldn't get it anyway.
677556 678556 Owie!
678682 679852 Samantha Kingston.
680267 681477 - Hi.<br />- Hey, Rob.
683479 685349 Did you get my rose?<br />I did.
686106 687276 Who are these ones from?
687483 688668 Your competition.<br />I want to see.
688692 689692 Your competition.
689777 691463 Oh, Sam has no competition, Rob.<br />You know it.
691487 694207 Okay. Well, neither do I, so I guess<br />we're perfect for each other.
696116 698276 So you're going to<br />that thing at Kent's tonight?
699495 701222 I heard he's getting a couple kegs.<br />I don't know.
701246 702296 Yes!
703123 704713 I'll text you later.<br />One more.
704792 706622 No, I'm eating!<br />Get out!
707503 708503 Go.<br />Bye.
708629 709856 You all are too cute.<br />It's gross.
709880 711300 Mmm.<br />Oh, you guys!
711799 714299 Tonight our widdle Sammy<br />passes into womanhood.
714385 715935 I am so proud.
716011 717181 Shh! Stop it.
717971 718971 I hope you shaved.
719056 720356 Oh, my God.
721975 723775 Don't forget to pee<br />before and after.
726980 729690 Guys, guys, sociopath,<br />12 o'clock.
731485 733405 Oh, God. Does she<br />know what a brush is?
733862 735142 No.
736657 737667 Norma Bates!
739743 740983 Hey, did she get<br />her Val-a-gram?
741328 742555 In chem, I was sitting<br />right behind her.
742579 743619 What'd she say?
743705 744795 Does she say anything ever?
744873 745913 Well, what'd she do?
746083 747363 She tossed it right after class.
747668 748978 She really should<br />appreciate it more.
749002 750722 It's probably the only rose<br />she'll ever get.
750879 753589 Maybe it had something<br />to do with the card.
753924 756514 "Maybe next year,<br />but probably not."
776113 777193 That's it, guys!
777781 778781 Go, girl.
780033 781033 I love it!
782202 783513 It kinda looks like you<br />put it on your cheeks.
783537 785707 It's the same color.<br />Yeah. That's the point.
787124 788124 Mmm.
788208 789868 Love it.<br />It's so effing good.
791295 792545 Can I post this one?
793964 794964 No.
796758 798338 Don't laugh at me.<br />Okay.
801722 802722 Linds?
808061 811061 Were you nervous<br />your first time?
815277 816737 I was too drunk to be anything.
818697 819817 Don't freak out if it hurts.
820657 821707 Especially at first.
821783 824123 And don't tense up, because<br />that only makes it worse.
825746 827956 Great. That sounds<br />really romantic.
828624 830143 Don't worry. It's not like<br />Rob is some random guy.
830167 832007 You actually like him.<br />Right. Yes.
832753 834673 Everyone wants to<br />hook up with him.
834796 836096 Yeah.
836423 838013 Tonight, everything changes.
840844 842474 That face.
843931 845261 Baes!
847017 849107 What are you doing? What<br />do you think you're doing?
864284 866454 Fart's house<br />is actually kinda nice.
866620 867805 If I had known,<br />I would have stopped
867829 869949 calling him Danny DeVito<br />all year.
870624 871714 Sam and you.
897901 900281 Hey, I'm gonna go find Patrick.<br />Will you be okay?
900362 902192 What? I'm gonna go find Patrick.
902281 903641 Will you be okay?<br />Yeah, yeah, yeah.
903949 905069 Mwah!
913875 915505 Hey, Sam!
916044 917174 You made it.
922384 924264 Sam! Sam!<br />Hi!
928015 929645 Oh, I am sorry.<br />Let me get that for you.
932519 933729 How drunk are you?
933854 935254 I'm not drunk.<br />Don't worry about it.
935856 936906 Know what?
938650 941030 You're the hottest girl in here.<br />The hottest.
943488 946818 Okay, look, I'm only gonna be<br />here like an hour, an hour tops.
946992 949202 You know? You text<br />me and we'll go.
949328 951368 We're just gonna go.<br />Just me and you. Okay.
955876 957886 Oh, my... Okay. Sorry. Oh.
958003 959543 What happened?<br />Nothing.
960380 961750 I'll see ya later, okay?
976063 977863 Elody's really<br />embarrassing herself.
978440 979560 Elody's a slut.
979858 981688 Lindsay's a bitch<br />and a drama queen.
981943 983693 I'm rich and have ADD.
984696 985696 Baes!
986615 987915 Bae!
988241 991661 Come on.<br />Oh, get in here, baby!
993872 998082 Patrick, will you go get me something<br />a little bit stronger than this beer?
998418 999458 What's the magic word?
999920 1001750 Blowjob.
1001880 1003460 BRB.<br />Thank you.
1004257 1006557 Where have you been? I've been<br />looking everywhere for you.
1006635 1007685 Have you?<br />Yes!
1007761 1008881 Like in Patrick's mouth?
1011014 1012014 Oops.
1012224 1015434 What? Oh, she's so shitfaced!
1015644 1017814 No, you're shitfaced, shitface.
1018397 1020947 I can't believe high<br />school's almost over.
1021191 1022191 Aw.
1022275 1023985 Well, actually, we did<br />it right, you know?
1024277 1027327 Kissed the hottest boys,<br />went to the sickest parties.
1031243 1033453 Do you think we'll<br />remember any of this?
1033578 1037078 I mean, like two years,<br />three years from now?
1037457 1039127 I won't even<br />remember this tomorrow.
1050345 1053305 Oh, my God.
1053598 1054808 What's she doing here?
1068280 1069900 Up.<br />Okay.
1086506 1089676 Hello, sweetie.<br />Is that your first drink?
1090969 1092929 You really should take it easy.
1100687 1102147 You're a bitch!
1104191 1105481 Excuse me?
1106568 1107688 Whoa.
1108987 1110077 You heard me.
1111072 1115282 You're a goddamn fetid bitch<br />just like your mother.
1115911 1118491 It's no wonder<br />Daddy left. Huh?
1119706 1120933 - You're a bitch, too.<br />- What?
1120957 1121967 You're a drunk.
1123210 1124370 And you...
1127172 1128524 You're just pathetic.<br />You know what?
1128548 1130168 We'd rather be bitches<br />than a psycho.
1130258 1131298 Yeah, psycho.
1131384 1134014 Have you noticed<br />that nobody likes you?
1134721 1135865 - Yeah, psycho.<br />- Psycho.
1135889 1137759 Has anyone at this party...
1137891 1139452 - Has anyone talked to you?<br />- I don't think so.
1139476 1140936 You weren't even invited.
1141019 1142519 That's 'cause you're a freak.
1142771 1143811 Go back to the ward.
1143897 1145197 Go home.
1148068 1149068 Go home.
1154783 1156913 Get off me! Get off me!
1157661 1159661 Who are you?
1160455 1161455 You're the bitch!
1165460 1166460 Psycho!
1167379 1168379 Psycho!
1169464 1171344 Get this bitch on a leash!
1171424 1172424 Psycho!
1172509 1173509 You wanna go?
1174636 1175976 Freak, get out of here!
1181601 1182891 Go!
1190235 1193615 Go back to the ward,<br />you psycho bitch!
1197033 1198033 Are you okay?
1206167 1207627 What the hell<br />was that about, huh?
1208712 1210542 I don't know. She just<br />called us bitches...
1210630 1211691 What did she do?<br />In front of everybody.
1211715 1213192 So you attack her?<br />Okay. This is not my fault!
1213216 1214402 You gang up<br />and pour beer all over her?
1214426 1215426 You know what...
1215969 1219049 Who are you? Come on...<br />Do not touch me.
1221057 1222910 You know, your boyfriend's<br />throwing up in my sink.
1222934 1224214 So, you wanna take care of that?
1235739 1236739 Come on. Come on!
1249502 1251382 That was insane.
1253256 1254556 I'm sorry about Rob, bae.
1256092 1257092 Music!
1258720 1261970 Pacific Northwest, my ass.<br />I hate this weather.
1262307 1265147 Do you guys wanna get some food?<br />I really need carbs.
1265560 1267020 You sound like my grandmother.
1267228 1268938 Meh.<br />Here.
1269522 1271375 Oh, I like this song.
1314234 1315734 She called us bitches.
1318613 1319823 I guess we are.
1323076 1324286 What time is it?
1325036 1326836 Did you see<br />that look in her eyes?
1326913 1329123 - I mean, she just snapped.<br />- Yeah.
1329749 1330851 She freaked me out.
1356484 1359324 Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<br />Let's shake it, sister!
1390268 1392888 Sammy, you like the bird<br />I made you?
1393354 1394774 Mommy says you have to get up.
1394981 1396061 It's Saturday.
1398818 1401358 Mommy, Sammy won't get up!
1401446 1403406 Don't make me come up there.
1424594 1425684 Yeah?
1425762 1427182 Sexy lady!
1429307 1430437 What are you doing?
1430517 1433237 I'm so sorry. I had a nightmare,<br />so it's a slow start.
1433812 1435352 Um...
1435855 1437855 What happened last night?
1439067 1443697 Oh. Sorry. I was FaceTiming<br />with Patrick till, like, 3:00.
1445365 1446535 Speaking of which,
1447242 1448872 are you nervous for tonight?
1450203 1451203 What?
1452497 1454707 You, Rob, his flannel sheets?
1457085 1458085 I'm gonna shower.
1458294 1459634 Nope, no time. Come on.
1459754 1460754 It's Cupid Day.
1467720 1469140 Whoo!
1483444 1484654 Seriously?
1484737 1487216 Okay, this was maybe funny the<br />first bazillion times you did it.
1487240 1488490 It's still funny.
1490618 1491618 Yeah, baby!
1491703 1493333 Nice tits!
1498835 1500335 Ooh. I have your present.
1501212 1504422 No glove, no love.<br />You hear me?
1504799 1506049 It goes on him.
1518980 1521610 Sisyphus, not an STD.
1521774 1524194 All right. Keep it down.<br />Keep it down, people.
1529991 1531031 It's so beautiful.
1531367 1532636 I'm in heteronormative hell.
1532660 1534490 Thank you, girls. Thank you.
1534579 1536749 Okay, okay, let's hope<br />third time's the charm.
1537415 1538505 Yo, Sam.
1546007 1547017 Oh, man.
1547592 1549882 Sam, you forgot this one.
1549969 1551549 No, I didn't forget it.
1551638 1552678 What do you mean?
1552764 1553866 The more roses<br />you get on Cupid Day,
1553890 1554950 the more popular you are, right?
1554974 1557144 Thanks for the tip, Kent.<br />Noted.
1557644 1559204 Well, I didn't say<br />the rose was from me.
1565235 1566655 But it is from you, right?
1568655 1569695 Well...
1572408 1574488 Anyway, my mom is out of town...
1574577 1576247 Out of town and<br />you're having a party?
1577121 1579081 Yeah. Do you<br />wanna come? Or...
1579165 1580165 I have to go.
1580250 1582710 Well, see you tonight? Or...
1604232 1605482 Are you nervous?
1606234 1608694 No, no, no, no, no.
1609821 1612261 You don't want to waste the first<br />night you go full womanhood.
1614033 1615913 Okay, you sure they look good?
1615952 1618305 I just really don't want to look<br />like I'm trying too hard, you know?
1618329 1620079 You're fine.
1623459 1624959 Such a weird day.
1625753 1626753 Like how?
1626838 1628588 Just weird.
1628673 1632513 I feel like I'm still dreaming<br />from yesterday, like...
1632593 1636013 Or maybe yesterday was the dream.<br />I don't know... Whoa.
1636097 1638607 You're awake now!<br />No, no, no, no!
1639600 1641810 Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!<br />Don't. Don't do that.
1655325 1658125 Oh, my God, there's so many<br />hot guys here tonight!
1674886 1677146 I'm gonna go find Patrick, okay?
1677221 1678221 What?
1679474 1680594 I'll be right back!
1682477 1685317 Sam! Hey, you made it!
1692570 1693900 Sam. Sam.
1696991 1699071 Oh, I am sorry.<br />Let me get that for you.
1699160 1700580 Rob, I need to talk to you.<br />What?
1700661 1701741 About what? What's up?
1701829 1703289 I'm feeling pranked.
1704040 1705267 Tonight was supposed to be<br />our special night...
1705291 1707461 No, no, no, no, no. Rob?<br />What?
1707543 1711043 I don't feel good.<br />I'm freaking out.
1712131 1714211 It's always something.<br />Can we go talk some...
1714300 1716670 It's always something.<br />Where?
1716761 1721011 Okay, Sam. Okay. I'm gonna<br />fill my cup up first.
1721099 1723139 Five minutes. Can<br />you wait that long?
1795131 1796301 This room is off limits.
1800219 1803299 I was just looking<br />for the bathroom.
1803431 1804511 Sorry.
1805141 1808311 I feel like I'm having Déjà<br />vu with you being in my room.
1808978 1812018 Oh, my God, I've been having<br />Déjà vu all day long.
1816277 1817367 Are you okay?
1820615 1822955 Yeah. Excuse me.
1824035 1825785 I've been looking<br />everywhere for you.
1825870 1827620 Yeah?<br />In Patrick's mouth, maybe.
1830833 1834423 You seem a little guilty.<br />Were you with Rob, you hussy?
1834504 1836174 Skank.<br />Harlot.
1836255 1837691 Hey, are you guys<br />talking about me?
1837715 1839151 You know what?<br />I think I'm gonna go home.
1839175 1840595 No, no, no!<br />What?
1840676 1842321 You don't have to drive me.<br />It's okay. I'll find a ride.
1842345 1844305 No, we just got here.<br />I'm confused.
1844388 1847008 I thought you were supposed<br />to get it on with Rob tonight.
1847099 1848139 Yeah.
1849352 1851942 Yeah, I changed my mind.
1852021 1853901 Well, at least I'm not<br />gonna be the only virgin.
1857026 1860076 Oh, my God.
1860279 1861489 What's she doing here?
1866536 1867786 Watch this.
1874627 1876137 Is that your first drink?
1881425 1882675 You're a bitch!
1883469 1884799 Just like your mother.
1885346 1887606 No wonder Daddy left. Huh?
1888975 1890395 - You're a bitch, too.<br />- What?
1890476 1891526 You're a drunk.
1891602 1892852 And you...
1894772 1896022 You're just pathetic.
1896107 1897237 Juliet...
1897316 1899294 You know what? We'd rather<br />be bitches than a psycho.
1899318 1900318 Yeah, psycho.
1900403 1903073 Have you noticed<br />that nobody likes you?
1903155 1904383 - Yeah, psycho.<br />- Psycho.
1904407 1906287 Has anyone at this party...
1906367 1907886 - Has anyone talked to you?<br />- I don't think so.
1907910 1910330 - Go back to the ward.<br />- Go home.
1913082 1914412 Go home.
1917461 1918631 Get off me!
1924844 1926134 Go to hell!
1926762 1928392 Freak, get out of here!
1929098 1930598 Get the fuck out!
1932310 1934140 Get this bitch on a leash!
1934228 1936308 Psycho! Psycho.<br />You wanna go?
1940026 1943446 Go back to the ward,<br />you psycho bitch!
1951912 1953348 What do you think<br />people will say about you
1953372 1954622 when you die?
1954707 1956337 Like I care.<br />I'm serious.
1956417 1957467 That we're hot.
1957543 1959103 This shit is morbid, Sam.
1959170 1960670 Hey, watch the road.<br />Hey.
1961088 1962190 We need music.<br />You watch the road.
1962214 1964174 Guys, I'll find a song.
1964258 1965668 I want to help you pick a song.
1965760 1967010 Okay, mom.
1967094 1968134 Guys, wait.<br />Don't elbow me.
1968220 1969590 Just pick something.
1970890 1972760 You're trouble.<br />You always have to pee.
1972850 1974430 'Cause she drinks too much.
1974518 1976678 That, and she has the<br />bladder of a baby squirrel.
1987698 1988738 The truck.
1989367 1990377 Truck?
1990451 1992451 Watch out for the truck.<br />What truck?
2007551 2008681 How did you...
2014892 2020102 It wasn't a dream.<br />It really happened. Again.
2049635 2051135 Sammy, you like the bird<br />I made you?
2051220 2052720 It's origami.
2052805 2054895 Mommy says you have to get up.
2054974 2056064 Tell Mom I'm sick.
2058477 2060487 You don't feel hot.<br />Stop it.
2070197 2071207 Let go!
2072992 2075492 Mommy, Sammy won't get up!
2078748 2081038 It wasn't until then
2081125 2083255 that I allowed myself<br />to think the worst.
2083335 2084335 Sam?
2085254 2086614 What's this about you<br />feeling sick?
2087882 2089012 I just don't feel good.
2089759 2091129 On Cupid Day?
2098809 2100349 Did something happen?
2103481 2104601 I don't know.
2107234 2108524 Did you and Rob have a fight?
2108611 2111241 No. Mom, go away.
2112364 2114664 Please don't use that tone.<br />I'm just trying to help.
2114742 2116342 I just need to sleep<br />a little bit longer.
2118245 2119335 Please?
2121457 2124127 Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay<br />know that you're going in late.
2124210 2126040 But I have to be<br />at work by 10:00.
2163457 2165047 Thank you for driving me.
2165125 2166755 Sure.
2171131 2172841 Sammy...<br />Hmm.
2173133 2175803 You'll feel better once you<br />see some of your roses.
2177888 2181718 I don't know. Maybe.
2185437 2187527 Well, you're lucky<br />to be so popular.
2187606 2191236 When I was a senior,<br />I hadn't even kissed a boy.
2191902 2193732 Everyone said my eyes<br />were too close together
2193821 2195441 and that I looked like a fish.
2197950 2199280 Yeah.
2208127 2209837 I have to get to work, honey.
2211005 2212675 I think you're beautiful.
2217970 2219800 Go.<br />Bye.
2236989 2239659 Maybe everything was connected.
2243037 2245707 Maybe a flock of birds<br />could cause a rainstorm
2245831 2248541 and everything done<br />could be undone.
2253923 2255883 Maybe things could change.
2258427 2260437 And maybe I could change them.
2266018 2269688 It's Rob.<br />We're having issues.
2270230 2272060 But it's the day.
2272733 2275023 The note in his<br />Val-a-gram said "Love ya."
2276195 2277995 "L-U-V ya. Luv ya."
2278072 2280008 What is that? We've been<br />going out since last year.
2280032 2284032 Yeah. Well, you know, maybe he's just<br />waiting to say it, like, tonight.
2284161 2285388 I'm not gonna have sex with him
2285412 2287292 just so that he says<br />"I love you."
2287373 2288373 I'm not gonna do that.
2289375 2291625 We go out every weekend. Mmm.
2291710 2293210 I don't know.<br />I wanna stay in.
2293587 2294597 Like we used to.
2294713 2296303 Okay, but the only reason<br />we stayed in
2296382 2298972 was because we weren't invited<br />to any senior parties.
2299176 2304646 I just, bottom line, don't want to<br />have to deal with that today. Okay?
2309228 2310228 Okay.
2310479 2311479 All right.
2312064 2313234 What are you doing?
2314775 2316495 - What is she...<br />- Don't worry.
2316944 2318654 Are you texting...
2318737 2319787 Oh, my God.
2319863 2321183 That devilish grin, though.
2324910 2326080 Oh, my God.
2326412 2327912 What? What?
2328580 2329933 Why did he give me that...<br />What did you say?
2329957 2333047 Relax, I just told him<br />that you got your period.
2334461 2336261 That's a good one. Yes.<br />That's perfect.
2337756 2339716 - You're welcome!<br />- That's a good one.
2339758 2342338 Lock up the knives and babies!
2342428 2343530 Does it smell like pee in here?
2343554 2344614 Yeah, I can smell her from here.
2344638 2346508 Remind me again.<br />Why do we hate Juliet?
2347933 2349313 Are you serious?
2349435 2353105 We don't hate her. It's just she's super<br />creepy with all those weird drawings.
2353480 2355690 Remember Mellow Yellow<br />in the fifth grade?
2355774 2356774 Oh, my God.
2356817 2359117 When Lindsay found out that<br />she peed in her sleeping bag
2359194 2360574 on the Girl Scout trip.
2362156 2364036 Why do you care all of a sudden?
2364116 2365996 You know she should be<br />institutionalized.
2367119 2369449 I was just wondering.<br />That's all.
2373625 2374853 So, we're going over<br />to your house, right?
2374877 2376007 Obviously.
2377296 2378636 Can I borrow something?
2378714 2380964 Always. I got you.
2397566 2400656 Hey. Uh, these came for you<br />in Daimler's class.
2400778 2402608 I know I'm not wearing<br />the appropriate attire,
2402696 2404956 but I promise<br />they're legitimate.
2407159 2408239 Cool.
2408327 2410627 Also, uh, this rose<br />came for you.
2416168 2418668 It's kind of like<br />a painting of a rose.
2418796 2420796 You know, it stands out<br />in front of all the others.
2424176 2425346 Thank you.
2425427 2428437 Hey, I never said<br />that it was from me.
2429515 2432855 But, whoever it was from, they put<br />a lot of thought into it. So...
2436939 2439519 By the way, my mom is<br />out of town this weekend,
2439650 2441440 so I'm gonna throw<br />a big party tonight.
2441527 2442537 Yeah.
2442653 2444293 Did you remember the address?<br />Or do you...
2444321 2445321 Hey, Sam.
2445531 2449871 It was third grade, so you<br />probably don't remember.
2451370 2453790 But do you, uh... You<br />think you'll come? Or...
2453872 2456002 No, I can't. Sorry.
2456208 2458208 Oh, come on.
2458335 2461795 Well, I'm... I could have<br />crutches on call for you,
2461880 2463680 in case you want to climb<br />up the tree... Kent.
2463799 2465799 And play flying squirrel.<br />That was one time.
2465884 2468634 Look, I'm just saying. I'm prepared.<br />I'm prepared.
2468720 2471050 Okay, glad to hear it.<br />So, that's a maybe, or...
2473559 2474809 I don't think so.
2474893 2476603 Well, I'll take<br />that "No" as a "Maybe."
2476687 2479157 So, maybe I'll see you tonight.
2493996 2495086 Oh, God.
2495831 2497751 Juliet Sykes<br />just arrived at the party.
2497833 2498833 Gross.
2498917 2501427 Yeah. The worst.<br />I'm so glad we didn't go.
2502921 2506091 Mmm. Snapchat alert. Rob is totally<br />puking in the kitchen sink.
2506175 2507415 Oh, I want to see that.
2507759 2509079 I wanna see that.
2509595 2510725 Of course he is.
2510929 2513049 I don't wanna see it.<br />It's gross. ELODY: Ew.
2514141 2515641 You kiss that?
2516810 2518496 I can't believe you made<br />this ice cream, Ally.
2518520 2519706 It's literally better<br />than a restaurant's.
2519730 2521291 No, it's true.<br />I mean, you should
2521315 2522775 go to cooking school.<br />Screw college.
2522858 2524688 Thanks, guys.<br />It has no dairy.
2524776 2526826 Oh, you're so full of shit.
2526945 2528195 Thirty-eight.
2528280 2530360 - Okay.<br />- You can shut up now.
2530449 2531699 What?
2534036 2535206 Matt's at the party.
2535287 2536607 Ally, you say "Matt"<br />one more time
2536663 2537983 and I will kill you<br />in your sleep.
2538081 2539291 I will kill you in your sleep.
2539374 2540964 I will kill you in your sleep.
2544421 2546091 12:39.
2570989 2573029 I wonder what filter<br />Terri uses on her photos.
2573116 2574496 Major Fomo.
2574576 2575746 Such a loser.
2575994 2577754 Ugh, Steve's flirting<br />with a freshman.
2577829 2578949 I love you guys.
2580916 2582756 Aw, Sam...
2586004 2587294 We love you, too.
2587673 2589593 Aw, we love you, Sam.<br />Weirdo.
2593262 2594722 Don't go emo on us.
2612322 2613992 Shit. Where's my phone?
2622291 2623711 Juliet Sykes is dead.
2640058 2641558 She killed herself.
2645355 2647565 But nothing happened<br />to her at the party.
2648525 2651155 How totally insane.
2660245 2661965 Could our rose have<br />something to do with it?
2662414 2663544 Don't be stupid.
2667711 2669421 God, imagine how<br />her family feels.
2669504 2671504 Look, you can't be mean<br />to someone forever
2671590 2673350 and then just feel badly<br />when they die, okay?
2673383 2674843 We all knew she was crazy.
2677054 2679394 God, Lindsay, she was your<br />best friend in fifth grade.
2680932 2683432 Yeah, I remember you used<br />to sleep over at her house.
2683560 2686850 Yeah, well, that was before<br />she became a sociopath, Ally.
2686938 2688268 I'm going back to sleep.
2698033 2699623 I'm going to sleep in my room.
2705415 2706965 I'm going with her.
2715133 2716843 You were friends with Juliet?
2720305 2722395 No one even talked<br />to you in fifth grade,
2722474 2724474 and I don't hold that<br />against you.
2728772 2730232 You never said anything.
2732651 2733920 We made fun of her<br />for all these years...
2733944 2735154 It's not our fault.
2751128 2752288 Go to sleep.
2810979 2815229 I did everything right.<br />And nothing changed.
2825827 2828587 I woke up this mornin'
2828663 2832163 Didn't recognize<br />the boy in the mirror
2832250 2836040 Then I laughed and I said<br />Oh silly me, that's just me
2836338 2840918 Then I proceeded to brush<br />some stranger's teeth
2841051 2844301 But they were my teeth<br />and I was weightless
2844387 2847517 Just quivering like some leaf<br />come in the window of a restroom
2847599 2851559 I couldn't tell you what the<br />hell it was supposed to mean
2851645 2854315 'Cause it was a Monday,<br />no, a Tuesday
2854397 2856947 No, a Wednesday,<br />Thursday, Friday
2857025 2860285 Then I woke up this mornin'
2882050 2885180 The day starts<br />and ends the same,
2885262 2887392 regardless of anything<br />I do or say.
2889558 2891218 If that's how it works,
2891309 2894389 I'm gonna do and say<br />whatever I want.
2912163 2913349 Oh, no, you're not wearing<br />that to school.
2913373 2914413 My Cupid Day outfit.
2914499 2916602 Yeah, well, you don't want to<br />give people the wrong idea.
2916626 2917756 What idea is that exactly?
2917836 2920096 No, this is not happening. Go<br />back up and change, please.
2920547 2923217 This is my life. I'll do whatever<br />the hell I want with it.
2924634 2926237 Dan, can you just jump in here, please?<br />Look, Sam...
2926261 2928591 That's so disrespectful to<br />talk to your mom... Hey, Sam!
2928680 2930510 Here... I told you not<br />to touch my stuff!
2930640 2932470 That's it!<br />You are grounded!
2932809 2936139 Grounded?<br />I'm already grounded.
2939691 2940691 Samantha!
2942777 2945367 Maybe I was dead and in hell.
2945447 2948457 Maybe I was alive and in hell.
2948533 2950873 But it didn't matter.
2950952 2952582 Nothing mattered anymore.
2957042 2958292 What are you wearing?
2959127 2960337 Funny.
2962297 2963347 Excuse me.
2964883 2967553 Jeez, wake up on the wrong<br />side of the bed or something?
2967677 2968887 For a few days now, yep.
2969220 2971220 Nice tits!
2973224 2974224 What happened to Sam?
2974476 2977486 Uh, someone forgot to take her<br />happy pills this morning.
2977562 2978562 I took mine.
2978688 2981098 Well, I know something<br />that'll cheer you right up.
2981191 2983651 I swear to God, Elody, if you<br />hand me a condom right now...
2985528 2988488 But it's your present.<br />For your special night.
2989366 2990366 Take it.
2991409 2993739 Unless you want to be<br />a walking STD farm.
2995121 2996241 You would know.
3000710 3002540 At least I'm not still a virgin.
3003380 3004960 What the hell is wrong with you?
3006091 3007461 What did you just say to me?
3007759 3009799 What is it? Do you feel like<br />you need to prove to us
3009886 3011516 that you don't give a shit?
3011596 3013436 Is that what it is?
3013556 3015534 'Cause guess what? You don't<br />need to prove anything.
3015558 3019018 We all know that you don't give a<br />damn about anybody but yourself.
3019104 3020944 We're all pretty<br />fucking clear on that!
3021147 3022947 What the hell is<br />your problem today, Sam?
3023024 3025274 You guys, don't fight.<br />Just drop it.
3025360 3026570 What, you don't agree?
3026778 3027778 Leave her out of it.
3027904 3031454 Why? You're the one who talks shit<br />about both of them all the time.
3031574 3034454 "Look at Elody<br />climbing all over Steve."
3034536 3036376 "He doesn't even like her.<br />Look at Ally."
3036454 3038704 "Oh, my God!<br />She's such a know-it-all."
3038790 3040510 "She just loves<br />the sound of her own voice."
3040583 3042061 "Hope Elody doesn't<br />puke in my car again"
3042085 3043445 "and make it smell<br />like alcoholic."
3043503 3044793 Stop it, Sam.
3048925 3049925 Out.
3051302 3052432 Get out!
3053596 3054766 Now!
3059978 3062688 I'd love to hear what you say<br />about me behind my back.
3084627 3087137 Sisyphus, not an STD.
3090967 3091977 Don't say it.
3095346 3097106 I'm in heteronormative hell.
3098975 3101935 Okay, thank you.<br />Thank you, girls. Thank you.
3102520 3105270 Okay, okay, let's hope third<br />time's the charm. Okay?
3106024 3107234 Sisyphus.
3108693 3110533 Sam! What?
3111196 3112286 You can take 'em.
3112363 3114203 Oh, Sam, you're breaking<br />hearts left and right.
3120330 3122200 Am I breaking yours,<br />Mr. Daimler?
3124542 3125542 What?
3127462 3130382 Your heart, am I breaking it?
3139474 3142064 No. You're not.
3142185 3144645 My patience, however,<br />is at its breaking point.
3145563 3147563 Take a seat. Please.
3148191 3149611 If you insist.
3155365 3158245 Okay. Sisyphus.
3159828 3160868 Sisyphus.
3162247 3164507 Why is our friend Sisyphus<br />still relevant today?
3164582 3166872 Why is the story<br />still relevant today?
3187939 3189379 Don't even think about it.
3190108 3193018 Turn around.<br />That way.
3193111 3194111 Bye.
3251002 3252832 Get this bitch out of here!
3253755 3254755 Psycho!
3263264 3264354 What the hell?<br />Shit.
3264474 3266184 What are you doing in here?
3269771 3271941 This is my bathroom.
3277862 3279032 Nice shoes.
3280657 3281707 Hard to walk in, huh?
3282033 3283993 I can walk in them<br />just fine, thank you.
3284118 3286238 Aw, you need a pair of these.
3287372 3288792 Comfiest shoes I ever owned.
3288873 3289873 Really?
3290166 3292046 All right, your loss.<br />Whatever.
3292168 3294538 You wanna trade?
3294629 3296209 Like, switch shoes?
3297548 3300048 Come on, Kingston. See if I<br />can get in those without...
3300134 3301174 Just get out.
3301260 3302880 Hurting myself.<br />Come on, let's try it.
3303554 3304894 Why not?<br />What?
3305014 3306184 Yeah, let's do it.
3307517 3308687 Come on!
3310061 3311891 Why do you guys hate me so much?
3316192 3319152 I know you know what's written<br />in this bathroom somewhere.
3322907 3324417 It's AC...
3326411 3329491 Equals...<br />BD, right?
3329580 3332870 Anna Cartulo equals bull dyke.
3334043 3336423 Or maybe it's<br />"biggest douchebag."
3339173 3342173 But I reckon that honor definitely<br />belongs to Lindsay Edgecomb.
3348099 3349389 So, is that it?
3352228 3353808 'Cause I'm gay?
3355732 3356942 I don't know.
3359235 3360587 Isn't that how<br />it always works out?
3360611 3363451 There's somebody laughing, there's<br />somebody being laughed at.
3365783 3367283 Right.
3369037 3370297 Look, whatever.
3370371 3375791 Really. I mean, this whole high<br />school thing's just a blip.
3378463 3380633 I'm not gonna remember<br />any of you.
3383968 3385218 I win.
3391100 3395140 Do you ever feel like you're living<br />the same day over and over again
3395229 3399439 with only, like, a few<br />things being different?
3403905 3407495 Oh, shit, Samantha. You just<br />described my whole life!
3416709 3418499 Hey, what's up?
3447990 3448990 Hey, Sam.
3449075 3451325 Did you have to ask<br />permission to talk to me?
3453079 3455949 Lindsay's just really upset<br />about what you said.
3456040 3457330 You should apologize.
3457834 3460424 Well, everything that<br />I said was true, so...
3460503 3462133 It doesn't matter if it's true.
3463131 3466051 She's Lindsay. She's ours.<br />We're each other's, you know?
3466843 3467843 Just apologize.
3467927 3469977 You're not listening to me.<br />I'm not sorry.
3470054 3471344 Please, Sam?
3472515 3475105 Why do you care so much, Elody?
3477061 3480601 Because...<br />You guys are all I have.
3497832 3500082 Are you still trying<br />to turn her against me?
3505923 3507923 You're the horrible driver.
3508009 3510549 You're the one always criticizing<br />people and hurting people.
3510636 3512531 You're the one who lied about<br />being friends with her
3512555 3514265 and then tortured her<br />for all these years.
3514390 3516180 I just followed along and yet...
3520479 3522149 I'm the one paying for it.
3524358 3526478 Sam, what are you talking about?
3526611 3528691 Whoa. What?
3529197 3532077 Oh, my God.
3539040 3541870 Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.<br />Where have you...
3565983 3567733 Get this bitch on a leash!
3567818 3570818 I love you. Is that what<br />you wanted to hear?
3570905 3573785 Go back to the ward,<br />you psycho bitch!
3601185 3602895 Sam?
3620705 3622255 Hey, are you okay?
3625084 3629134 Obviously, you're crying. But<br />is there something I can do?
3629213 3631133 I'll get you a tissue.<br />Yeah, yeah.
3634635 3635765 Thanks.<br />Yeah.
3644478 3646728 Sorry I'm in your room.<br />I know there's a sign.
3646814 3649314 No. Don't worry about it.
3649942 3651572 The sign's just really<br />for other people,
3651652 3652982 so they don't get in my stuff.
3654822 3657362 It's the first big party<br />I've ever had, so...
3658492 3660072 Why'd you have one now?
3663539 3665709 I figured if I had a party,<br />you'd come.
3675885 3677015 I like your room.
3677094 3680304 Yeah? It's my dad's<br />old den.
3681849 3683679 It must get a lot of light.
3683768 3684768 Yeah.
3685311 3688691 It's like waking up<br />in the middle of the sun.
3690983 3692613 I get to see the old tree.
3693444 3696614 I like it.<br />It's constant.
3699200 3700620 Is that the one<br />we used to sit in?
3702286 3704296 Yeah. Yeah, we did.
3705831 3708541 Do you remember climbing up it?
3708959 3711289 And then you jumped down<br />and sprained your ankle?
3712046 3713426 I was stupid.
3715174 3716674 It was very ambitious.
3719804 3720894 I should go.<br />Hey, hey, hey.
3720971 3724181 Hey. Just stay for<br />a second. Okay?
3728813 3731353 I can drive you home or...
3731482 3732982 I don't want to go home.
3736404 3738494 Okay, well, you can, uh...
3738572 3740702 You could crash here<br />if you want.
3742159 3744159 Not, like, with me.
3745162 3747752 Somewhere else.<br />I'll be somewhere else.
3749333 3751833 Bed completely to yourself.
3752002 3753922 The Kent McFuller master suite.
3759385 3760385 Yeah?
3761679 3762679 Okay.
3764181 3766511 Hey, it's okay.
3774275 3775315 Here.
3786036 3787546 I'm sorry about earlier.
3788914 3790254 Don't worry about that.
3790374 3792464 No, I'm sorry
3792543 3794503 I've always been so mean to you.
3800384 3802474 Don't look.<br />Don't read it. Please?
3802720 3804050 Why? It's...<br />It's something bad.
3807016 3808066 Okay.
3813689 3815149 Your skin's so hot.
3815566 3819406 It's always like that.
3834293 3836253 I wish we could be here forever.
3855439 3856769 Okay, let's try again.
3862279 3863559 We're taking a day off.
3864490 3866950 I think you're just<br />gonna drool around.
3867785 3868785 What is it?
3868911 3871451 And then you're just gonna go<br />through there and then like that.
3872122 3874792 If I was going to relive<br />the same day over and over,
3876335 3878465 I wanted it to be a worthy day.
3886929 3888259 But not just for me.
3907032 3908635 Do the kids at school<br />ever make fun of you
3908659 3909819 for the way that you talk?
3912997 3914167 Sometimes.
3916875 3918515 You can do something about that.
3920546 3922466 You know, you can learn<br />to talk differently.
3923591 3926631 But this is my voice. How will<br />kids even know it's me talking?
3929221 3930471 When I was in the fifth grade,
3930556 3935356 this girl used to<br />sing this song.
3936687 3939527 She smells like manure<br />and she lived in the sewer
3939648 3941518 Samantha Kingston
3941859 3943149 Who did that?
3944903 3946153 Lindsay.
3951493 3953083 How come you're so mean to Mom?
3957875 3959125 I'm not mean to Mom.
3960044 3962084 You drew a line on<br />the floor with nail polish
3962171 3963841 and said she couldn't cross it.
3965841 3967011 Mom and I had a fight,
3967092 3968552 and I was mad at her<br />in the moment,
3968636 3970016 but I didn't...
3972181 3974721 I didn't think that<br />she'd actually stay away.
3981357 3982367 Look at that.
3982733 3984085 That's just the outside,<br />how pretty it was.
3984109 3985399 Oh, my gosh.<br />Look at you guys.
3985527 3987947 - Can you send those to me?<br />- Aw!
3988072 3989862 So cute!<br />Those are beautiful.
3990032 3992032 Remember when you used to<br />come here all the time?
3992576 3993666 I do. Of course.
3994662 3997372 Then your daughter<br />got too cool, so...
3997748 3999708 I'm just kidding. IZZY: Can<br />we go watch the pizza?
3999750 4002080 Okay. Wait, tiger.
4007841 4009011 I'm glad we did this.
4009093 4012893 Yeah. It was really sweet<br />what you did today.
4018268 4019808 Do you think I'm a good person?
4022773 4025563 Of course I think you're a good person.
4025943 4028613 But it doesn't<br />really matter what I think.
4028737 4030537 I mean, what's important<br />is what you think.
4030614 4033034 No, I'm serious.<br />I want to know...
4034284 4036624 Why do you think<br />that I'm a good person?
4042960 4045880 Do you remember when<br />you were a little girl?
4045963 4049213 You used to take turns riding<br />all of the horses in the stable
4049299 4051419 so that none of them<br />would feel left out?
4052219 4053469 Do you remember that?
4053887 4055477 I do.<br />Mmm-hmm.
4057558 4060638 But I was a little girl.<br />It's different.
4061937 4064817 But you have a big heart, Sam.<br />That doesn't go away.
4067609 4068819 One good thing.
4068902 4073822 You just focus<br />on that one good thing,
4073907 4075917 and you see where it leads you.
4089673 4092093 How is it possible<br />to change so much
4092176 4094846 and not be able to<br />change anything at all?
4102770 4104640 I knew I had to do something.
4107316 4108486 Something good.
4162579 4163579 You made it.
4164373 4165413 Oh. Sorry.
4166208 4167748 The room's off limits.
4168085 4171135 No. Forget the sign.<br />It's no big deal.
4171213 4172853 That's really just there<br />for other people,
4172923 4174843 so they don't mess<br />with my stuff.
4176009 4177009 I'm glad you came.
4177094 4180434 Yeah. I had to. I like what<br />you've done with the place.
4180514 4184854 Yeah, this used to be<br />my dad's old den.
4185018 4188138 Now it's the Kent McFuller<br />master suite.
4189690 4191810 Yeah, not so good<br />in the morning, though.
4194069 4196779 It's like waking up in...<br />In the middle of the sun.
4201702 4202832 Yeah.
4209585 4211795 I hope you don't think<br />that it's weird
4211879 4214089 that I'm here<br />with you right now.
4215591 4217131 Sam, um...
4218802 4222512 I once wore Crocs<br />for 365 days straight,
4222598 4225598 so I don't think<br />anything's weird.
4226476 4227704 I forgot about your Crocs phase.
4227728 4228848 Yeah.
4236778 4239148 Why are you always<br />so nice to me?
4244786 4251586 Well, do you remember in third<br />grade right after my dad died?
4252836 4257636 We were in the cafeteria<br />and I was crying,
4258717 4263937 and Phil Howe came up to<br />me, called me a baby,
4264014 4267644 and then smacked my tray<br />right out of my hand,
4267726 4270686 and food went flying everywhere.
4272105 4273416 I remember what<br />we were eating, too.
4273440 4276440 It was, um, mashed potatoes<br />and turkey burgers.
4276526 4280366 And you came over,
4280447 4283707 you scooped up the mashed<br />potatoes right off the ground
4283784 4286954 and you went up to<br />Phil and you smashed
4287037 4288837 the mashed potatoes<br />right in his face.
4290582 4294042 And you then said, "You're<br />worse than a hot lunch,"
4294294 4298054 which, at the time,<br />was a really good insult.
4298715 4302555 I mean, I didn't laugh<br />more that day than...
4302636 4303886 I mean...
4307349 4313309 It was the first time I laughed<br />since my dad died and I...
4318652 4320482 Do you remember<br />what I said to you?
4327327 4328877 "You're my hero."
4329830 4331000 Yeah.
4333500 4336580 And that day I vowed<br />to be your hero, too.
4339047 4340597 No matter how long it took.
4352769 4354099 Look, I'm sorry.
4354187 4357867 No, don't do...<br />Don't be sorry. It's okay.
4360360 4361400 Good.
4363071 4364701 'Cause I'm not really sorry.
4388555 4389855 Shit.<br />Wait.
4397397 4398947 Sam! Hey!
4399441 4401071 Sam, wait, I...
4402527 4404237 Oh, my God,<br />Sam, did you see that?
4405489 4406489 Hey, Sam.
4407324 4408994 Did you see where Juliet went?
4411244 4412334 Juliet, stop!
4419503 4421093 Juliet!
4422172 4424252 Juliet! Wait!
4435143 4436183 Juliet!
4439940 4441360 Juliet!
4443860 4445190 Juliet!
4455539 4456869 Juliet, wait!
4480522 4481562 Juliet!
4487529 4488529 Juliet!
4495203 4496413 Juliet!
4503670 4505790 Juliet!<br />What are you doing?
4505922 4507567 I know what happened back there.<br />Get away from me.
4507591 4508734 And I feel really bad about it,
4508758 4509902 and I know this may sound crazy,
4509926 4512266 but I have a feeling I may<br />be able to understand you
4512345 4513845 better than you think<br />that I could.
4513930 4515260 You hate me.
4519769 4521439 I don't hate you.
4522272 4524522 I know we haven't always<br />been the nicest to you,
4524608 4528028 but the thing is that Lindsay<br />didn't mean anything by it.
4528111 4529422 We didn't know<br />what we were doing.
4529446 4531536 I used to be friends<br />with Lindsay.
4533533 4535873 It was right before<br />her parents got divorced.
4535952 4537263 I used to sleep over<br />at her house.
4537287 4539457 Her parents would be<br />fighting so bad.
4541291 4542791 She was so upset.
4545545 4548595 She was so upset, she<br />started wetting the bed.
4550133 4553553 You remember the name you<br />all gave me in fifth grade?
4553637 4555477 The name Lindsay gave me?
4557641 4558931 "Mellow Yellow."
4560018 4561138 Remember that?
4562020 4563190 You remember the camping trip
4563271 4565151 when I supposedly peed<br />in my sleeping bag?
4565273 4566483 It was Lindsay.
4567484 4569864 Lindsay's the one who peed.
4571696 4573016 When everyone asked<br />what happened,
4573073 4574573 she just pointed<br />her finger at me
4574658 4576488 and screamed,<br />"She did it."
4578662 4579662 Juliet...
4582999 4584289 Please let me help you.
4588964 4591054 It doesn't matter now.
4608608 4609858 Hey.
4611319 4613319 It's like your Val-a-gram<br />always said...
4615865 4620205 "Maybe next year, but..."
4622080 4623540 "Probably not."
4625250 4626250 Juliet.
4671087 4673807 For the first time,<br />when I wake up,
4675091 4681641 I'm not scared<br />or confused or angry.
4687228 4691978 Because, for the first time, I truly<br />understand what needs to happen.
4703495 4706455 I truly understand<br />how to live this day.
4719427 4720807 Oh, thank you.<br />Yeah.
4720887 4722057 Want something to eat?
4723807 4726567 I'm good, thanks.<br />Lindsay's got it covered.
4726643 4728183 Mom?<br />Oh.
4728603 4729603 I love you.
4730647 4731657 I love you, too.
4733983 4736323 What, no love for your old man?
4736444 4738114 I love you, too, old man.
4738196 4740286 Thank you.<br />Thank you.
4747831 4749581 Sammy, you forgot your gloves!
4750250 4752330 What would I do without you?
4756673 4757673 Hey.
4759968 4763638 You are perfect<br />the way that you are, Fizzy.
4766015 4767435 Always remember that.
4778820 4780320 I can't breathe!
4796546 4798386 It's cold!<br />Yeah.
4839255 4840425 What are you doing?
4841007 4844227 Auditioning for a Tampax commercial?<br />Let's go.
4856606 4857856 Yeah, baby!
4859609 4861819 Nice tits! Get in!
4863238 4864238 Yes.
4865073 4866403 You know how I like it.
4874123 4875253 Hey, Elody.
4876292 4877770 What, do I have<br />white stuff on my face?
4877794 4879634 You know why I love you?
4881130 4884300 I love you because you're<br />down for anything. Always.
4885301 4886551 You know<br />I'm a down-ass bitch.
4886636 4887686 You are.
4887762 4889142 Hey, I'm down, too.
4889305 4891055 Ooh. Okay.
4892725 4896565 No, I love you, Ally, because<br />you're curious about the world.
4898606 4900736 And you're passionate,<br />and you are driven.
4900817 4903157 Did someone swallow Oprah<br />this morning?
4907282 4908492 I love you, Linds.
4910285 4912585 I love you because<br />you're the kind of friend
4912662 4914412 that toilet-papers<br />Jason Foster's house
4914497 4916207 for a week straight<br />all by herself
4916291 4918161 just because he said<br />that I was a bad kisser.
4921170 4922290 Asshole.
4927594 4931604 Oh, uh, I think I know why<br />Sam's in such a good mood.
4934642 4936852 Oh.<br />It goes on him.
4949699 4951159 Thank you so much for that.
4966174 4968724 Sisyphus, not an STD.
4968843 4970973 Sorry, it was an emergency<br />and a tribulation.
4971054 4973144 A minor LaserJet explosion.
4973222 4974472 Val-a-gram delivery.
4974557 4975567 Happy Cupid Day.
4977894 4978984 It's so beautiful.
4979062 4980331 I'm in heteronormative hell.
4980355 4981355 I like your boots.
4982065 4983585 Sisyphus fails every time,
4985151 4989191 but he still thinks that he'll be<br />able to push that boulder uphill.
4990365 4992075 He's imprisoned<br />by his own hubris.
4993201 4995661 The only way to escape<br />is to change.
4996537 4997587 Be careful.
5000583 5001583 Oh, man.
5001709 5003749 Sam. Hey.<br />Hey.
5005672 5006922 Um... "You're my hero."
5007006 5008596 You got a secret admirer?
5008716 5012016 Secret?<br />That's not so secret.
5012095 5014095 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
5014180 5015220 Well, um...
5016391 5020141 Well, hey, listen, I'm having<br />a party tonight. Mmm-hmm.
5020353 5023653 And I was wondering if you<br />maybe wanted to come,
5024732 5026862 maybe? Yeah? No?
5026943 5028443 What's in it for me?
5029278 5031278 What's in it for me?
5034575 5037375 Yeah. And, um,
5037453 5039543 I have something I want to<br />tell you later. A secret.
5040123 5041963 Later? Okay.<br />Yes. Okay.
5042625 5044965 Wait, the "you're my hero"<br />thing, how did you...
5045128 5048248 Thank you for my beautiful rose.<br />I love it.
5055680 5058010 What'd you say to me?<br />This is not working out.
5059142 5061142 Okay, Sam, you can't<br />break up with me.
5061269 5066059 I think I can<br />and I think I just did.
5069152 5070152 I should've picked Elody.
5076325 5077495 What just happened?
5077952 5079312 You guys were supposed to...
5079370 5081410 I mean, you said<br />you wanted to...
5083416 5085006 It's Rob Cokran.
5086586 5087756 He doesn't deserve me.
5088337 5090177 Nonetheless, very shocking.
5090298 5092588 Sociopath, 12 o'clock.
5092759 5093839 Uh-oh.
5093926 5095486 Does it smell like pee in here?
5095511 5096761 Stop.
5096846 5098436 Norma Bates!<br />What?
5100183 5101183 Just don't.
5101517 5102527 But it's Juliet.
5102852 5105352 Exactly, it's Juliet.
5105480 5108020 She has a name<br />and she is a person.
5108357 5109907 Yesterday, you said<br />you were afraid
5109984 5112034 she would bite you<br />if she got too close.
5113863 5115653 That was a long time ago.
5118159 5119409 That was yesterday.
5163329 5164329 Hey, Linds.
5164413 5166253 All right, well, let's do this!
5166374 5167664 Linds.<br />What?
5168417 5170927 How come you never told me<br />about your parents' divorce?
5172839 5173999 Are you serious?
5175424 5176424 Yeah.
5178678 5181758 Why would I talk about something<br />that happened a thousand years ago?
5183182 5184932 Because it happened to you.
5186102 5187272 And you matter to me.
5187436 5188580 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
5188604 5189706 Come here.<br />Okay? Let's go inside.
5189730 5190770 Come here.
5194527 5197617 You know you don't have to<br />act so tough all the time.
5198406 5199406 Mmm.
5203119 5204949 Don't worry about me, okay?
5206497 5207707 I love you no matter what.
5207790 5209120 Let's get inside.<br />Okay.
5210293 5211853 Move, move, move.
5220136 5222266 Hey, um, you made it.
5222722 5223892 Come with me.
5223973 5225603 What? Okay.
5227101 5228471 What?
5232732 5235982 I believe<br />you owe me a secret, right?
5236110 5237400 I believe I do.
5237486 5239156 Okay, so let's hear it.
5243492 5247742 The secret is<br />yours was the best kiss
5247830 5250330 that I've ever had<br />in my entire life.
5253461 5255171 Um...
5255338 5258838 But we haven't kissed.
5262345 5264185 I mean,<br />not since the third grade.
5266807 5269777 Better get started then.<br />I don't have much time.
5301509 5302629 What was that for?
5303886 5305726 Because I wanted to.
5310851 5312141 I love you.
5328411 5330331 Juliet, I need to talk to you.
5330413 5332083 Just for a second.<br />It's okay. Please?
5332164 5333892 Actually, I kind of have<br />somewhere I have to be.
5333916 5335476 I know what you have<br />planned for tonight
5335751 5338671 and I want you to know that you<br />don't have to do this. Okay?
5338754 5339844 You don't know anything.
5339922 5342052 I know that you have<br />something to tell me.
5342425 5344175 You have something<br />to tell all of us.
5344260 5345430 You're a bitch.
5347763 5349103 I have been a bitch.
5350433 5352536 I have been a bitch. We all<br />have been bitches, and I...
5352560 5353560 I'm sorry.<br />I have to go.
5353602 5355247 Listen to me. I'm trying<br />to tell you how sorry...
5355271 5356271 I am sorry.<br />You said that.
5356397 5357917 I'm sorry,<br />but I have to come with you.
5358566 5359866 Leave me alone!<br />I can't.
5359942 5361112 Sam! Sam!
5361235 5363171 Why did you run away from me? I<br />can't talk to you right now.
5363195 5365007 You've been ignoring me for<br />years, and then you...
5365031 5367361 You kiss me and then go back<br />to acting like I'm invisible?
5367450 5369170 I meant everything<br />that happened back there.
5369243 5370679 That's all I can say,<br />that I meant it,
5370703 5372097 and I wish it hadn't<br />taken me so long.
5372121 5376621 Sam, are you in trouble?<br />You can trust me.
5377585 5379045 You can trust me back.
5384425 5385425 Juliet!
5388262 5389262 Juliet!
5397813 5398813 Juliet!
5409825 5410995 Juliet!
5412328 5413448 Juliet, don't!
5414955 5416165 Wait! Wait!
5416749 5418829 Why? What's going on?<br />Why are you following me?
5418918 5420918 Why can't you leave me alone?
5421003 5422003 You don't want to die.
5423255 5425135 You want the pain to stop.
5426509 5428419 Stop. You stop.
5428511 5430761 You don't know me.
5430846 5432766 You could never understand.
5432848 5434758 You have a choice, Juliet.
5434850 5436430 Not everybody gets that.
5436519 5437639 Sam!
5439688 5440978 Please let me help you.
5441315 5442775 Don't you get it?
5444276 5445536 You can't help me.
5447196 5448786 I can't be fixed.
5448864 5450454 You're not the one<br />who needs fixing.
5450533 5452033 There is nothing wrong with you.
5452159 5454279 Don't let anyone tell you<br />that there is.
5456997 5461877 This is just a blip.<br />Your life will change, Juliet.
5463295 5467715 If you just hold on<br />for one more minute.
5475391 5476431 It's too late.
5477560 5480230 No, it's not.<br />It's never too late.
5485401 5486401 Juliet, stop!
5500875 5502585 Maybe for you<br />there's a tomorrow.
5505254 5509924 Maybe for you<br />there's 1,000 or 3,000
5512553 5513553 or 10.
5516765 5520105 But for some of us,<br />there's only today.
5522438 5524598 And what you do today matters.
5525608 5526688 In the moment
5529570 5531320 and maybe into infinity.
5533407 5535037 I see only my greatest hits.
5545753 5547793 I see the things<br />I want to remember.
5552134 5554184 And be remembered for.
5561143 5564353 That's when I realized that<br />certain moments go on forever.
5567942 5570482 Even after they're over,<br />they still go on.
5573989 5575319 They are the meaning.
5577826 5578826 Sam?
5580496 5581796 Sam?
5584333 5586003 You saved me.
5588837 5589847 No.
5591507 5593307 You saved me.
