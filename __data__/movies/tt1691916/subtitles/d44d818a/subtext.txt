2165121 2166748 JULIE: Sure.
2171127 2172837 (EXHALES) Sammy...<br />Hmm.
2173129 2175799 You'll feel better once you<br />see some of your roses.
2177884 2181721 I don't know. Maybe.
2185433 2187519 Well, you're lucky<br />to be so popular.
2187602 2191231 When I was a senior,<br />I hadn't even kissed a boy.
2191898 2193733 Everyone said my eyes<br />were too close together
2193817 2195443 and that I looked<br />like a fish.
2195527 2197112 (BOTH CHUCKLE)
2197946 2199280 Yeah.
2208123 2209833 Ihaveto<br />get to work, honey.
2211000 2212669 I think you're beautiful.
2215630 2217173 (CHUCKLES)
2217966 2219801 Go.<br />Bye.

2243032 2245702 <i>Maybe a flock of birds<br />could cause a rainstorm</i>

2272729 2275023 The note in his<br />Val-a-gram said "Love ya."
2276191 2277984 "L-U-V ya. Luv ya."
2278067 2279944 What is that? We've been<br />going out since last year.
2280028 2284032 Yeah. Well, you know, maybe he's just<br />waiting to say it, like, tonight.
2284157 2285325 I'm not gonna<br />have sex with him
2285408 2287285 just so that he says<br />"I love you."
2287368 2288369 I'm not gonna<br />do that.
2289370 2291623 We go out every weekend. Mmm.
2291706 2293208 I don't know.<br />I wanna stay in.
2293583 2294584 Like we used to.
2294709 2296294 Okay, but the only reason<br />we stayed in
2296377 2298963 was because we weren't invited<br />to any senior parties.
2299172 2304636 I just, bottom line, don't want to<br />have to deal with that today. Okay?
2309224 2310225 Okay.

2355770 2356729 Oh, my God.

2362151 2364028 Why do you care<br />all of a sudden?
2364112 2365989 You know she should be<br />institutionalized.
2367115 2369450 I was just wondering.<br />That's all.
2373621 2374789 ELODY: So, we're going over<br />to your house, right?
2374873 2375999 LINDSAY: Obviously.

2408323 2410617 Also, uh, this rose<br />came for you.
2416164 2418666 It's kind of like<br />a painting of a rose.
2418791 2420585 You know, it stands out<br />in front of all the others.
2424172 2425340 Thank you.
2425423 2428426 Hey, I never said<br />that it was from me.
2429510 2432847 But, whoever it was from, they put<br />a lot of thought into it. So...
2436935 2439520 By the way, my mom is<br />out of town this weekend,
2439646 2441439 so I'm gonna throw<br />a big party tonight.

2445526 2449864 It was third grade, so you<br />probably don't remember.

3290162 3292039 All right, your loss.<br />Whatever.
3292164 3294541 You wanna trade?
3294625 3296210 Like, switch shoes?
3297544 3300047 Come on, Kingston. See if I<br />can get in those without...
3300130 3301173 Just get out.
3301256 3302883 ...hurting myself.<br />Come on, let's try it.
3303550 3304885 Why not?<br />What?
3305010 3306178 Yeah, let's do it.
3307513 3308680 Come on!
3310057 3311892 Why do you guys<br />hate me so much?
3316188 3319149 I know you know what's written<br />in this bathroom somewhere.
3322903 3324404 It's AC...
3326406 3329493 Equals...<br />BD, right?
3329576 3332871 Anna Cartulo<br />equals bull dyke.
3334039 3336416 Or maybe it's<br />"biggest douchebag."
3339169 3342172 But I reckon that honor definitely<br />belongs to Lindsay Edgecomb.
3348095 3349388 So, is that it?
3352224 3353809 'Cause I'm gay?
3355727 3356937 I don't know.
3359231 3360524 Isn't that how<br />it always works out?
3360607 3363443 There's somebody laughing, there's<br />somebody being laughed at.
3365779 3367281 Right.
3369032 3370284 Look, whatever.
3370367 3375789 Really. I mean, this whole high<br />school thing's just a blip.

3449071 3451323 Did you have to ask<br />permission to talk to me?
3453075 3455953 Lindsay's just really upset<br />about what you said.
3456036 3457329 You should apologize.
3457829 3460415 Well, everything that<br />I said was true, so...
3460499 3462125 It doesn't matter<br />if it's true.
3463126 3466046 She's Lindsay. She's ours.<br />We're each other's, you know?
3466838 3467839 Just apologize.
3467923 3469967 You're not listening to me.<br />I'm not sorry.
3470050 3471343 Please, Sam?
3472511 3475097 (STAMMERS) Why do you care<br />so much, Elody?
3477057 3480602 Because“.<br />You guys are all I have.
3497828 3500080 Are you still trying<br />to turn her against me?
3505919 3507921 You're the horrible driver.
3508005 3510549 You're the one always criticizing<br />people and hurting people.
3510632 3512467 You're the one who lied about<br />being friends with her
3512551 3514261 and then tortured her<br />for all these years.
3514386 3516179 I just followed along<br />and yet...
3520475 3522144 I'm the one paying for it.
3524354 3526481 Sam, what are you<br />talking about?

3658488 3660073 Why'd you have one now?
3663535 3665704 I figured if I had a party,<br />you'd come.

4273436 4276439 It was, um, mashed potatoes<br />and turkey burgers.
4276522 4280359 And you came over,
4280443 4283696 you scooped up the mashed<br />potatoes right off the ground
4283780 4286949 and you went up to<br />Phil and you smashed

4290578 4294040 And you then said, "You're<br />worse than a hot lunch,"
4294290 4298044 which, at the time,<br />was a really good insult.
4298711 4302548 I mean, I didn't laugh<br />more that day than...
