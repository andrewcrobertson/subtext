2114739 2116199 I just need to sleep<br />a little bit longer.
2118242 2119327 Please?
2121454 2124123 Okay. Well, I'll let<br />Lindsay know that<br />you're going in late.
2124207 2126042 But I have to be<br />at work by 10:00.
2163454 2165039 Thank you for driving me.
2165122 2166749 JULIE: Sure.
2171128 2172839 (EXHALES) Sammy...<br />Hmm.
2173130 2175800 You'll feel better<br />once you see<br />some of your roses.
2177885 2181722 I don't know. Maybe.
2185434 2187520 Well, you're lucky<br />to be so popular.
2187603 2191232 When I was a senior,<br />I hadn't even kissed a boy.
2191899 2193734 Everyone said my eyes<br />were too close together
2193818 2195444 and that I looked<br />like a fish.
2195528 2197113 (BOTH CHUCKLE)
2197947 2199282 Yeah.
2208124 2209834 I have to<br />get to work, honey.
2211002 2212670 I think you're beautiful.

2276192 2277985 "L-U-V ya. Luv ya."
2278069 2279946 What is that?<br />We've been going out<br />since last year.
2280029 2284033 Yeah. Well, you know,<br />maybe he's just waiting to<br />say it, like, tonight.
2284158 2285326 I'm not gonna<br />have sex with him
2285409 2287286 just so that he says<br />"I love you."
2287370 2288371 I'm not gonna<br />do that.
2289372 2291624 We go out<br />every weekend.<br />Mmm.
2291707 2293209 I don't know.<br />I wanna stay in.

2294710 2296295 Okay, but the only reason<br />we stayed in
2296379 2298965 was because<br />we weren't invited to<br />any senior parties.
2299173 2304637 I just, bottom line,<br />don't want to have to deal<br />with that today. Okay?
2309225 2310226 Okay.

2425424 2428427 Hey, I never said<br />that it was from me.
2429512 2432848 But, whoever it was from,<br />they put a lot of thought<br />into it. So...

3277859 3279027 Nice shoes.
3280654 3281696 Hard to walk in, huh?
3282030 3283990 I can walk in them<br />just fine, thank you.
3284115 3286242 Aw, you need<br />a pair of these.
3287369 3288787 Comfiest shoes I ever owned.
3288870 3289871 Really?
3290163 3292040 All right, your loss.<br />Whatever.
3292165 3294542 You wanna trade?
3294626 3296211 Like, switch shoes?
3297545 3300048 Come on, Kingston.<br />See if I can get<br />in those without...
3300131 3301174 Just get out.

3303551 3304886 Why not?<br />What?
3305011 3306179 Yeah, let's do it.
3307514 3308682 Come on!
3310058 3311893 Why do you guys<br />hate me so much?
3316189 3319150 I know you know<br />what's written in this<br />bathroom somewhere.
3322904 3324406 It's AC...
3326408 3329494 Equals...<br />BD, right?
3329577 3332872 Anna Cartulo<br />equals bull dyke.
3334040 3336418 Or maybe it's<br />"biggest douchebag."
3339170 3342173 But I reckon that honor<br />definitely belongs<br />to Lindsay Edgecomb.
3348096 3349389 So, is that it?
3352225 3353810 'Cause I'm gay?
3355729 3356938 I don't know.
3359232 3360525 Isn't that how<br />it always works out?
3360608 3363445 There's somebody laughing,<br />there's somebody being<br />laughed at.
3365780 3367282 Right.
3369034 3370285 Look, whatever.
3370368 3375790 Really. I mean,<br />this whole high school<br />thing's just a blip.
3378460 3380628 I'm not gonna remember<br />any of you.

3449072 3451324 Did you have to<br />ask permission<br />to talk to me?
3453076 3455954 Lindsay's just really upset<br />about what you said.
3456037 3457330 You should apologize.
3457831 3460416 Well, everything that<br />I said was true, so...
3460500 3462127 It doesn't matter<br />if it's true.
3463128 3466047 She's Lindsay. She's ours.<br />We're each other's, you know?
3466840 3467841 Just apologize.
3467924 3469968 You're not listening to me.<br />I'm not sorry.
3470051 3471344 Please, Sam?
3472512 3475098 (STAMMERS) Why do you care<br />so much, Elody?
3477058 3480603 Because...<br />You guys are all I have.
3497829 3500081 Are you still trying<br />to turn her against me?
3505920 3507922 You're the horrible driver.
3508006 3510550 You're the one always<br />criticizing people<br />and hurting people.
3510633 3512468 You're the one who lied about<br />being friends with her
3512552 3514262 and then tortured her<br />for all these years.
3514387 3516181 I just followed along<br />and yet...
3520476 3522145 I'm the one paying for it.
3524355 3526482 Sam, what are you<br />talking about?

3644475 3646728 Sorry I'm in your room.<br />I know there's a sign.
3646811 3649314 No. Don't worry about it.
3649939 3651566 The sign's just really<br />for other people,
3651649 3652984 so they don't get<br />in my stuff.
3654819 3657363 It's the first big party<br />I've ever had, so...
3658489 3660074 Why'd you have one now?
3663536 3665705 I figured if I had a party,<br />you'd come.
3675882 3677008 I like your room.
3677091 3680303 Yeah? It's my dad's<br />old den.
3681846 3683681 It must get a lot of light.

3708956 3711292 And then you jumped down<br />and sprained your ankle?
3712043 3713419 I was stupid.
3715171 3716672 It was very ambitious.
3719801 3720885 I should go.<br />Hey, hey, hey.

3962168 3963836 and said<br />she couldn't cross it.
3965838 3967006 Mom and I had a fight,
3967089 3968549 and I was mad at her<br />in the moment,
3968633 3970009 but I didn't...

4045960 4049213 You used to take turns<br />riding all of the horses<br />in the stable

4258714 4263928 and Phil Howe<br />came up to me,<br />called me a baby,
4264011 4267640 and then smacked my tray<br />right out of my hand,
4267723 4270684 and food went<br />flying everywhere.
4272102 4273354 I remember what<br />we were eating, too.
4273437 4276440 It was, um, mashed potatoes<br />and turkey burgers.
4276523 4280361 And you came over,
4280444 4283697 you scooped up<br />the mashed potatoes<br />right off the ground
4283781 4286951 and you went up to<br />Phil and you smashed
4287034 4288827 the mashed potatoes<br />right in his face.
4288994 4290412 (BOTH LAUGH)
4290579 4294041 And you then said,<br />"You're worse<br />than a hot lunch,"
4294291 4298045 which, at the time,<br />was a really good insult.
4298712 4302549 I mean, I didn't laugh<br />more that day than...
4302633 4303884 I mean...
4307346 4313310 It was<br />the first time I laughed<br />since my dad died and I...
4318649 4320484 Do you remember<br />what I said to you?
4327324 4328867 "You're my hero."
4329827 4330995 Yeah.

4563268 4565145 when I supposedly peed<br />in my sleeping bag?
4565270 4566480 It was Lindsay.
4567481 4569858 Lindsay's the one<br />who peed.
4571693 4572986 When everyone asked<br />what happened,
4573070 4574571 she just pointed<br />her finger at me
4574655 4576490 and screamed,<br />"She did it."
4578659 4579660 Juliet...
4582996 4584289 Please let me help you.
4588961 4591046 It doesn't matter now.

5365028 5367363 You kiss me and then<br />go back to acting<br />like I'm invisible?
5367447 5369115 I meant everything<br />that happened back there.
