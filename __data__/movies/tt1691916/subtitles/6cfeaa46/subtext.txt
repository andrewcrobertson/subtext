64964 66865 <i>Maybe for you<br />there's a tomorrow.</i>
79212 84716 <i>Maybe for you,<br />there's 1,000 or 3,000...</i>
86252 87519 <i>Or ten.</i>
100266 103001 <i>So much time,<br />you can bathe in it.</i>
109175 111643 <i>So much time, you can waste it.</i>
117650 121920 <i>But for some of us,<br />there's only today.</i>
123022 125257 <i>And what you do today matters...</i>
126192 127659 <i>In the moment...</i>
128761 130829 <i>And maybe into infinity.</i>
137870 142274 <i>But I didn't know any of that<br />until right before I fell.</i>
146846 150148 <i>The thing is,<br />they don't get to know.</i>
150150 152851 <i>You don't wake up with a bad<br />feeling in your stomach</i>
152853 154186 <i>or see shadows move.</i>
155188 156988 <i>If you're like me,</i>
156990 160225 <i>you wake up<br />24 minutes and 47 seconds</i>
160227 163128 <i>before your best friend is<br />supposed to be picking you up.</i>
164630 168867 <i>If you're like me,<br />your last day starts like this.</i>
216082 217616 Outside at 2:00.
217618 220519 Well, I'll let you know by noon.
220521 223121 Well, I can't organize a playdate...<br />you want something to eat?
223123 225190 Nope. Good.
225192 228226 Sammy, you like<br />the bird I made you?
228228 229594 Morning.
232198 233565 Sammy!<br />What?
233567 235467 You forgot your gloves.
235469 238703 Izzy, how many times do I have to tell you?<br />Don't touch my stuff.
239806 241273 Go back inside.<br />It's cold.
248815 249981 Hey, sexy.<br />Hi.
249983 251716 Get in.<br />Okay.
260226 263929 I love the sky on<br />mornings like this. Hey.
263931 266398 Greasy forehead.<br />Window. Off.
269435 272838 I'm gonna try not to be depressed<br />because I'm single on cupid day.
272840 275173 That's Valentine's day to you!
276275 277943 Have insomnia<br />or something, Linds?
277945 280078 - Excuse me?<br />- It's just cute
280080 282514 - that you get up before us to get breakfast.<br />- Ooh.
282516 285784 - Did she just call me cute, Kingston?<br />- I believe she did, Edgecombe.
285786 288987 Al, Linds doesn't do "cute."<br />No.
288989 291857 - It's not in her lexicon.<br />- Lexicon? Nice word choice.
296763 297863 Whoo!
297865 299764 Come on.
307307 309374 Seriously?
309376 312444 This was maybe funny the first<br />bazillion times you did it.
312446 314112 Still funny.<br />Still is.
314114 315814 Still funny.
319519 320752 Go, baby! Yeah!
324357 326525 No texting and driving.
326527 329995 Don't worry. I'd never let<br />my best friend die a virgin.
331532 333565 You didn't think<br />we'd forget, did you?
333567 336034 It's the big day.<br />Opening night.
336036 339871 Rob texted me. He said, "I<br />made my bed for you." Ugh!
339873 341573 That is so sweet.
341575 344142 No glove, no love.
344144 345977 You hear me?<br />Take it!
345979 347746 Take it! Take it!
347748 350215 Take it!<br />Take it! Take it! Take it!
350217 352317 Okay, okay, okay. Watch the road.<br />Oh, my god.
352319 354152 All right. It's fine.<br />We're fine. We're fine.
354154 357255 Crazy.<br />We're freakin' fine.
424724 427158 How many roses did you<br />get last year, Linds?
427160 428660 Twenty-two.
428662 430562 I'm going for 25<br />this year, though,
430564 433999 and more than one of them<br />better be from Patrick.
434001 435967 Did I tell you I sat next to Rob
435969 439137 and I had to make him<br />fill out the request form?
439139 441072 It was depressing.
441074 442907 I'd be happy with 15.
442909 445677 I'm not ashamed to admit it.
445679 448146 Last year, Matt literally<br />sent me a dozen red roses.
448148 450815 Matt? Oh, come on.
450817 454119 You just spent a whole week crying<br />in the same pair of sweatpants,
454121 455854 and it got dark.
455856 458990 We're not going back there. No,<br />I've told you a thousand times.
458992 461092 I'll say it again.
461094 463928 You do not need<br />that loser. Honestly.
463930 465096 Mm-mmm.
465098 466798 You got your real baes here.<br />Mm-hmm.
466800 468633 We love you. Come here.
468635 471469 Till death do us part.<br />Even then.
471471 473438 Oh, get in here.
473440 475040 Mmm. Mmm.
475042 476675 All right, bitches, let's move.
480680 482380 Sisyphus.
482382 484783 Not an std.
484785 487886 What's he like?
487888 492323 What does it mean when something<br />is described as being Sisyphean?
492325 495460 Does it mean pointless?
496128 497395 Brave?
499165 500732 Late?
500734 503301 Ah... sorry. It was an<br />emergency in the<i> tribulation.</i>
503303 507572 It was a minor<br />laserjet explosion.
507574 508973 I hope the printer survived.
510509 512711 All right, back to Sisyphus.
512713 514379 What's his character like?
514381 516381 Does he learn<br />from pushing that Boulder,
516383 517816 and it...
517818 519651 Hey.<br />Val-a-gram delivery.
523856 525990 Happy cupid day.<br />Go ahead.
539572 542240 Relax. It's just roses.
542242 544743 Aw, no roses for Anna.
544745 547946 - That from your boy?<br />- It's from Rob, yeah.
547948 550381 All right, all right. Keep it down.<br />Keep it down, people.
550383 552350 Oh, my god!
555755 557188 It's so beautiful.
561627 563695 I'm in heteronormative hell.
570202 573605 Okay, okay, let's hope third<br />time's the charm. Okay?
573607 575206 Sisyphus.
578444 580612 Back to Sisyphus, class.
582548 585216 Yo, Sam.<br />Hey.
588587 590622 Oh, man.
592124 594092 Sam. Hey.<br />Hi.
594094 596461 Did you, uh... did you like it?<br />What?
596463 598496 Hey, so, um, big party tonight.
598498 600265 Mom is going out of town.<br />Whoa.
600267 602801 Huge rager, you know.<br />Why don't you come? Yeah?
602803 604435 I don't know what my plans are.
604437 605937 What everyone else<br />ends up doing.
605939 607438 See you tonight.<br />No.
607440 608973 You know the address.<br />Kent.
629295 631196 You hear about Anna?<br />- You mean bull dyke.
631198 633198 Please say she tripped<br />over her nose.
633200 637035 Not yet. But her girlfriend saw the snap<br />that we posted with her and that girl.
637037 639137 She straight up dumped her.
639139 640471 See?<br />What?
640473 643007 This is why I deserve<br />some public recognition
643009 644676 for making shit<br />like that happen.
644678 647111 Maybe someone should<br />give me a ribbon.
647113 649681 Like the ones that you used to<br />have hanging on your wall, Sammy.
649683 651349 Remember?<br />From horseback riding?
651351 653184 I was, like,<br />ten years old, Lindsay.
653186 655320 God, Sammy, you were<br />such a nerd back then.
655322 657288 Okay, but isn't it weird<br />how that stuff happens?
657290 659057 How things connect<br />in strange ways.
659059 661392 If Lindsay didn't post that<br />snap... she deserved it.
661394 663394 I'm just saying, it's crazy now.
663396 666064 I saw this video about chaos<br />in the universe. Listen.
666066 670068 How a bird flapping its wing in south America<br />can create a major rainstorm in New York.
670070 673171 Like how one person can watch a<br />pretentious video about chaos
673173 675840 while three other people<br />actually die of boredom.
675842 678643 It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so<br />you guys wouldn't get it anyway.
678645 680979 - Owie.<br />- Samantha Kingston.
680981 682380 Hi.<br />Hey, Rob.
682382 684048 Hey, Rob.
684050 687085 Did you get my rose?<br />I did...
687087 689153 Who are these ones from?<br />Your competition.
689155 692490 I wanna see. Sam has no competition, Rob.<br />You know it.
692492 695460 Okay, well, neither do I. So I guess<br />we're perfect for each other.
697029 700331 So you're going to that<br />thing at Kent's tonight?
700333 703001 - I heard he's getting a couple kegs.<br />I don't know. -Yes!
704036 705670 I'll text you later.<br />One more.
705672 709507 No, I'm eating.<br />Get out. Go.
709509 711209 God, they're too cute.<br />It's gross.
711211 715280 Oh, you guys, tonight our "wittle"<br />Sammy passes into womanhood.
715282 717048 I'm so proud.<br />Shh.
718718 721185 I hope you shaved.<br />Oh, my god.
722621 724589 Don't forget to pee<br />before and after.
726292 727859 Ah.
727861 730528 Guys. Guys,<br />sociopath, 12 o'clock.
732431 734766 Oh, god. Does she know<br />what a brush is?
734768 735967 No.
736970 738736 Norma bates.
738738 742073 Hey, did she get<br />her val-a-gram?
742075 743775 In chem, I was sitting<br />right behind her.
743777 745977 What'd she say?<br />Does she say anything ever?
745979 748546 What'd she do? She tossed<br />it right after class.
748548 751282 She really should appreciate it more. It's<br />probably the only rose she'll ever get.
751284 754552 Maybe it had something<br />to do with the card.
754554 757555 "Maybe next year,<br />but probably not."
782182 785316 it kinda look like you put it on<br />your cheeks. It's the same color.
785318 787151 Yeah.<br />That's the point.
788354 792023 Mmm. Love it.<br />It's so effin' good.
792025 795693 Can I post this one?<br />No.
797663 799597 Don't laugh at me.<br />Okay.
802101 803968 Linds?
808941 812276 Were you nervous<br />your first time?
816048 817849 I was too drunk to be anything.
819285 821552 Don't freak out if it hurts.
821554 823788 Especially at first.<br />And don't tense up,
823790 826391 'cause that only makes it worse.
826393 828693 Great. That sounds<br />really romantic.
828695 831129 Don't worry. It's not like<br />Rob is some random guy.
831131 833031 You actually like him.<br />Right. Yes.
833033 835533 So, everyone wants<br />to hook up with him.
835535 837068 Yeah.
837070 839537 Tonight everything changes.
841573 843408 Mwah. That face.
844810 846744 Baes!
847880 849647 What are you doing?
865198 867932 Fart's house<br />is actually kind of nice.
867934 871402 If I'd known, I would've stopped<br />calling him Danny Devito all year.
871404 872837 Sam and you.
898731 901365 I'm gonna go find Patrick.<br />Will you be okay?
901367 904402 What? I'm gonna go find Patrick.<br />Will you be okay?
904404 906037 Yeah.<br />Mwah.
914747 916414 Hey. Sam.
916416 918983 You made it.
923322 925056 Sam. Sam.<br />Hi!
926959 928626 Whoo!
928628 931129 Oh, I am sorry.<br />Let me get that for you.
933732 935933 How drunk are you? I'm not drunk.<br />Don't worry about it.
935935 937702 You know what?
939771 942406 You're the hottest girl here.<br />The hottest.
944443 947845 Okay, look, I'm only giving you,<br />like, an hour, an hour tops.
947847 950281 You know?<br />You text me and we'll go.
950283 952416 We're just gonna go,<br />just me and you.
956689 958823 Oh, my goodness.<br />Oh.
958825 960591 What happened?<br />Nothing.
960593 962760 I'll see you later, okay?
977009 978943 Elody's really<br />embarrassing herself.
978945 980778 Elody's a slut.
980780 982813 Lindsay's a bitch<br />and a drama queen.
982815 985283 I'm rich and have add.
985285 986951 Bae!
986953 988819 Bae!
988821 990788 Come on!
990790 992957 Oh, get in here, baby.
994793 998963 Patrick, can you go get me<br />something a little bit stronger?
998965 1000865 What's the magic word?
1002869 1004802 Brb.<br />Thank you.
1004804 1007205 I've been looking<br />everywhere for you.
1007207 1008372 Have you?<br />Yes.
1008374 1010308 Like in Patrick's mouth?
1011843 1012977 Oops.
1012979 1014245 What?
1014247 1016647 Oh, she's so shitfaced.
1016649 1019217 No, you're shitfaced, shitface.
1019219 1021786 I can't believe<br />high school's almost over.
1023222 1025189 Well, actually, we did<br />it right, you know.
1025191 1028159 Kissed the hottest boys,<br />went to the sickest parties.
1032097 1034432 Do you think we'll<br />remember any of this?
1034434 1038369 I mean, like two years,<br />three years from now?
1038371 1040838 I won't even remember<br />this tomorrow.
1051216 1055786 Oh, my god.<br />What's she doing here?
1069101 1071202 Up.<br />Okay.
1087319 1089153 Hey there, sweetie.
1089155 1090855 Is that your first drink?
1091890 1093891 You really should take it easy.
1101466 1103634 You're a bitch!
1103636 1106337 Excuse me?
1107472 1108472 Whoa.
1109775 1112143 You heard me.
1112145 1116747 You're a goddamn fetched<br />bitch just like your mother.
1116749 1119250 It's no wonder<br />daddy left. Huh?
1120585 1122086 You're a bitch too.<br />What?
1122088 1123988 You're a drunk.
1123990 1125156 And you...
1127492 1129327 You're just pathetic.
1129329 1131262 You know what? We'd rather<br />be bitches than a psycho.
1131264 1132430 Yeah, psycho.
1132432 1135499 Have you noticed<br />that nobody likes you?
1135501 1136867 Psycho.<br />Psycho.
1136869 1140471 Did anyone at this party...<br />Has anyone talked to you?
1140473 1142039 I don't think so.<br />You weren't even invited.
1142041 1144642 That's 'cause you're a freak.<br />Go back to the ward.
1144644 1146043 Go home.
1148814 1151382 Go home.
1155687 1158389 Get off me!<br />Get her off me!
1158391 1160791 Who are you?
1160793 1162259 Get out of here!
1166298 1167298 Psycho!
1168200 1169200 Psycho!
1170135 1172069 Get this bitch on a leash!
1172071 1173504 Psycho!
1173506 1176006 - You wanna go?<br />- Freak!
1176008 1177808 Get out of here!
1177810 1179143 What the fuck?
1182080 1183814 Go!
1191223 1194525 Go back to the ward,<br />you psycho bitch!
1197829 1198829 Are you okay?
1207205 1209573 What the hell<br />was that about? Huh?
1209575 1211575 I don't know.<br />She just called us bitches.
1211577 1213411 What did she do?<br />So you attack her?
1213413 1215413 This is not my fault.<br />You throw beer all over her?
1215415 1216914 You know what?
1216916 1220084 Who are you...<br />Do not touch me.
1222120 1225055 Your boyfriend's throwing up in my sink.<br />You wanna take care of that?
1236535 1237535 Come on.<br />Come on!
1250549 1252883 That was insane.
1253885 1255386 I'm sorry about Rob, bae.
1256822 1257822 Music!
1259391 1261425 Pacific northwest, my ass.
1261427 1263394 I hate this weather.
1263396 1266330 Do you guys want to get some food?<br />I really need carbs.
1266332 1268132 You sound like my grandmother.
1268134 1270234 Meow.<br />Meow.
1270236 1272903 Oh, I like this song.
1314714 1316614 She called us bitches.
1319317 1321552 I guess we are.
1323856 1325689 What time is it?
1325691 1327791 Did you see<br />that look in her eyes?
1327793 1330294 - I mean, she just snapped.<br />- Yeah.
1330296 1331896 She freaked me out.
1357489 1360491 Sam, you're 20 minutes late!
1391189 1394091 Sammy, you like<br />the bird I made you?
1394093 1395926 Mommy says you have to get up.
1395928 1398028 It's Saturday.
1399631 1402566 Mommy, Sammy won't get up.
1402568 1404935 Don't make me come up there.
1425256 1426490 Yeah?
1426492 1428892 Sexy lady!
1430128 1432596 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm so sorry.
1432598 1434765 I had a nightmare,<br />so it's like a slow start.
1434767 1438669 Um, what happened last night?
1439971 1442072 Oh. Sorry.
1442074 1443974 I was facetiming with Patrick
1443976 1445809 till, like, 3:00.
1445811 1447444 Speaking of which,
1447446 1449680 are you nervous for tonight?
1450949 1451949 What?
1453418 1456020 You, Rob, his flannel sheets?
1457622 1459857 - I'm gonna shower.<br />- No. No time.
1459859 1461492 Come on. It's cupid day.
1468433 1470167 Whoo!
1484283 1487885 Seriously? This was maybe funny the<br />first bazillion times you did it.
1487887 1490320 Still funny.
1492024 1494291 Nice tits!
1499564 1501532 Ohh, I have your present.
1501534 1505736 No glove, no love.<br />You hear me?
1505738 1507538 It goes on him.
1519719 1521418 Sisyphus.
1521420 1522686 Not an std.
1522688 1525089 All right, all right,<br />keep it down, people.
1530762 1533731 - It's so beautiful.<br />- -I'm in heteronormative hell.
1533733 1535599 Thank you, girls. Thank you.
1535601 1537701 Okay, let's hope<br />third time's the charm.
1537703 1540003 Yo, Sam.
1546678 1548412 Oh, man.
1548414 1550848 Sam. You forgot this one.
1550850 1553617 No, I didn't forget it.<br />What do you mean?
1553619 1556019 The more roses you get on cupid day,<br />the more popular you are, right?
1556021 1558589 Thanks for the tip,<br />Kent. Noted.
1558591 1560858 I didn't say<br />the rose was from me.
1565897 1567865 But it<i> is</i> from you, right?
1569434 1571869 Well, i...
1571871 1575372 I... anyway, my mom's<br />out of town...
1575374 1577975 Out of town and you're<br />having a party?
1577977 1580277 Yeah. Do you wanna...<br />You wanna come or...
1580279 1583781 I have to go. Well, can<br />I see you tonight? Or...
1601633 1603100 <i>What we do?</i>
1605004 1607070 You're nervous?
1607072 1609406 No. No, no, no,<br />no, no, no, no.
1611176 1614244 You don't wanna waste the first<br />night you go full womanhood.
1614246 1616280 Oh!<br />Yeah!
1616282 1619116 Do I look good? I just really don't<br />wanna look like I'm trying too hard.
1619118 1620751 You're fine.
1624189 1626423 Such a weird day.
1626425 1629526 Like how?<br />Just weird.
1629528 1631995 I feel like I'm still<br />dreaming from yesterday.
1631997 1636333 Like... or maybe<br />yesterday was the dream.
1636335 1638101 I don't know.<br />You're awake now!
1638103 1640304 No, no, no, no, no!<br />Oh, my god!
1640306 1642673 No, don't you... don't... don't do that.<br />I'm sorry.
1675708 1679576 I'm gonna go find Patrick, you guys.<br />Mwah!
1683315 1684448 Sam!
1685383 1686583 Hey, you made it.
1693258 1695158 Sam. Sam.
1697896 1700264 Oh, I am sorry.<br />Let me get that for you.
1700266 1702599 Rob, I need to talk to you.<br />About what? What's up?
1702601 1704868 I'm feeling pranked.
1704870 1707204 Tonight was supposed to be our<br />special night. No, no, no, no.
1707206 1708538 Rob.<br />What?
1708540 1712843 I don't feel good.<br />I'm freaking out.
1712845 1714745 Always something.<br />Can we go talk?
1714747 1717247 Always something.
1717249 1720050 Okay, Sam. Okay.
1720052 1722085 I'm gonna fill my cup up first.
1722087 1724354 Five minutes.<br />Can you wait that long?
1795593 1797094 This room's off-limits.
1800965 1804167 I was just looking<br />for the bathroom.
1804169 1805969 Sorry.
1805971 1810007 I feel like I'm having D�j�<br />vu with you being in my room.
1810009 1813610 Oh, my god. I've been having<br />D�j� vu all day long.
1816948 1818782 Are you okay?
1821285 1823153 Yeah.
1823155 1824388 Excuse me.
1824390 1826823 I've been looking<br />everywhere for you.
1826825 1829459 Oh, yeah?<br />In Patrick's mouth maybe.
1832230 1835632 You seem a little guilty.<br />Were you with Rob, you hussy?
1835634 1837200 Skank.<br />Harlot.
1837202 1839236 Hey, you guys talking about me?
1839238 1842339 You know what? I think I'm gonna go home.<br />No, no, no.
1842341 1845142 No, we just got here.<br />I'm confused.
1845144 1848078 I thought you were supposed to<br />get it on with Rob tonight.
1848080 1849312 Yeah.
1850415 1852682 Yeah, I changed<br />my, um... my mind.
1852684 1855152 Well, at least I'm not<br />gonna be the only virgin.
1857922 1861158 Oh, my god.
1861160 1862392 What's she doing here?
1867331 1868765 Watch this.
1882013 1883847 You're a bitch!
1883849 1886083 Just like your mother.
1886085 1888585 No wonder daddy left.<br />Huh?
1890021 1891354 You're a bitch too.<br />What?
1891356 1893523 You're a drunk.<br />And you...
1895726 1897561 You're just pathetic.
1897563 1898728 Juliet.<br />You know what?
1898730 1900630 We'd rather be bitches<br />than a psycho.
1900632 1903800 Psycho. Have you noticed<br />that nobody likes you?
1903802 1905235 Psycho.<br />Psycho.
1905237 1908405 Did anyone at this party...<br />Has anyone talked to you?
1908407 1909906 I don't think so.<br />Go back to the ward.
1909908 1911108 Go home.
1913811 1915212 Go home.
1918283 1919549 Get off me!
1925423 1927057 Psycho!
1927059 1929459 Freak!<br />Get out of here!
1929461 1931428 Get the fuck out!
1931430 1933964 Psycho! Psycho!
1933966 1936133 Get this bitch on a leash.<br />Psycho!
1936135 1937135 You wanna go?
1941072 1944241 Go back to the ward,<br />you psycho bitch!
1952850 1955752 What do you think people will<br />say about you when you die?
1955754 1957687 Like I care.<br />I'm serious.
1957689 1960157 - That we're hot.<br />- This shit is morbid, Sam.
1960159 1961958 Hey, watch the road.
1961960 1963293 You watch the road.<br />We need music.
1963295 1966463 Guys, I'll find a song.<br />I want to pick a song.
1966465 1967931 Okay, mom.
1967933 1971134 Don't elbow me.<br />Just pick something.
1971136 1973803 You're trouble.<br />You always have to pee.
1973805 1975672 'Cause she drinks too much.
1975674 1977807 That, and she has the<br />bladder of a baby squirrel.
1988352 1989786 The truck.
1989788 1991354 Truck?
1991356 1993723 - Watch out for the truck.<br />- What truck?
2015846 2018381 <i>It wasn't a dream.</i>
2018383 2020383 <i>It really happened.</i>
2020385 2021651 <i>Again.</i>
2051083 2053617 Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<br />It's origami.
2053619 2055752 Mommy says you have to get up.
2055754 2057621 Tell mom I'm sick.
2059390 2062592 You don't feel hot.<br />Stop it.
2070134 2072102 Let go!
2073871 2077040 Mommy, Sammy won't get up!
2079644 2081778 <i>It wasn't until then</i>
2081780 2084114 <i>that I allowed myself<br />to think the worst.</i>
2084116 2085649 Sam?
2085651 2088151 What's this about<br />you feeling sick?
2088153 2090387 I just don't feel good.
2090389 2092389 On cupid day?
2099563 2101197 Did something happen?
2104168 2105735 I don't know.
2107972 2110073 Did you and Rob have a fight?<br />No.
2110075 2113443 Mom, go away.
2113445 2115745 Please don't use that tone.<br />I'm just trying to help.
2115747 2117747 I just need to sleep<br />a little bit longer.
2118949 2120150 Please?
2122420 2125121 Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay<br />know that you're going in late.
2125123 2127424 But I have to be<br />at work by 10:00.
2164328 2167030 - Thank you for driving me.<br />- Sure.
2171302 2174204 Sammy.<br />Hmm?
2174206 2176706 You'll feel better<br />once you see some of your roses.
2178576 2180477 I don't know.
2181812 2183079 Maybe.
2186183 2188585 Well, you're lucky<br />to be so popular.
2188587 2192689 I mean, when I was a senior,<br />I hadn't even kissed a boy.
2192691 2196493 Everyone said my eyes were too close<br />together and that I looked like a fish.
2198729 2200163 Yeah.
2209006 2210640 I have to get to work, honey.
2211876 2213843 I think you're beautiful.
2218783 2220750 Go.<br />Bye.
2238068 2240537 <i>Maybe everything</i> was<i> connected.</i>
2243941 2246576 <i>Maybe a flock of birds<br />could cause a rainstorm</i>
2246578 2249813 <i>and everything done<br />could be undone.</i>
2254785 2256953 <i>Maybe things could change.</i>
2259223 2261357 <i>And maybe I could change them.</i>
2266464 2267964 It's Rob.
2269467 2270800 We're having issues.
2270802 2273102 But it's the day.
2273104 2275738 The note in his val-a-gram<br />said, "luv ya."
2276807 2279142 "L-u-v ya." Luv ya.
2279144 2281277 What is that? We've been<br />going out since last year.
2281279 2285014 Yeah, well, you know, maybe he's just<br />waiting to say it, like, tonight.
2285016 2286583 I'm not gonna have sex with him
2286585 2288318 just so that he says,<br />"I love you."
2288320 2289586 I'm not gonna do that.
2289588 2292622 We go out every weekend. Hmm.
2292624 2294123 I don't know.<br />I wanna stay in.
2294125 2295625 Like we used to.
2295627 2297694 Okay, but the only reason<br />we stayed in
2297696 2299829 was because we weren't invited<br />to any senior parties.
2299831 2301698 I just,
2301700 2305101 bottom line, don't wanna have<br />to deal with that today.
2305103 2306103 Okay?
2309773 2311341 Okay.
2311343 2312343 All right.
2313644 2316045 - What are you doing?<br />- Shh, shh, shh.
2316047 2317814 What is she...<br />Don't worry.
2317816 2319782 Are you texting...
2319784 2322452 - Oh, my, god.<br />- That devilish grin though.
2327525 2330059 Why did he give me that...
2330061 2332028 What did you say?<br />Relax.
2332030 2334864 I just told him that you<br />got your period. Oh, my...
2334866 2336466 - That's perfect.<br />- That's a good one.
2338536 2340570 - You're welcome.<br />- That's a good one.
2340572 2342305 Lock up the knives and babies!
2342307 2344741 Does it smell like pee in here?
2344743 2347210 I can smell her from here.<br />Why do we hate Juliet?
2348812 2351381 - Are you serious?<br />- We don't hate her.
2351383 2354384 It's just she's super creepy,<br />with all those weird drawings.
2354386 2357854 Remember mellow yellow in the fifth grade?<br />Oh, my god.
2357856 2360089 When Lindsay found out that<br />she peed in her sleeping bag
2360091 2361925 on the girl scout trip.
2362993 2365061 Why do you care all of a sudden?
2365063 2367330 You know she should<br />be institutionalized.
2367332 2369599 I was just wondering.
2369601 2370934 That's all.
2374672 2378374 - So we're going over to your house, right?<br />- -Obviously.
2378376 2382145 - Can I borrow something?<br />- Always. I got you.
2398596 2401698 Hey. Uh, these came for<br />you in Daimler's class.
2401700 2403700 No, I know I'm not wearing<br />the appropriate attire,
2403702 2405702 but I promise<br />they're legitimate.
2407938 2409739 Cool.
2409741 2412542 Also, uh, this rose<br />came for you.
2416614 2419549 It's kind of like<br />a painting of a rose.
2419551 2421317 It stands out<br />in front of all the others.
2424788 2426389 Thank you.
2426391 2430493 Hey, I-i never said<br />that it was from me.
2430495 2433630 But whoever it was from, they put<br />a lot of thought into it, so...
2437768 2440470 By the way, my, uh, mom<br />is out of town this weekend,
2440472 2444073 so I'm gonna throw a big<br />party tonight. Yeah.
2444075 2446442 Did you remember the<br />address or you... hi, Sam.
2446444 2450847 It was... it was third grade,<br />but probably don't remember.
2450849 2454684 But, uh... but do you, uh...<br />You think you'll come or...
2454686 2456919 No, I can't. Sorry.
2456921 2459188 Oh, come on.
2459190 2462859 Well, I'm... I could have, uh,<br />crutches on call for you...
2462861 2464861 Kent. In case you want<br />to climb up the tree
2464863 2466829 and play flying squirrel.<br />That was one time.
2466831 2468965 Look, I'm just saying,<br />I'm pre... I'm prepared.
2468967 2470533 I'm prepared.<br />Okay, glad to hear it.
2470535 2471768 So that's a maybe or...
2472770 2473836 Uh...
2474505 2475872 I don't think so.
2475874 2477540 Well, I'll take that "no"<br />as a "maybe."
2477542 2480176 So maybe I'll see you tonight.
2490488 2492055 <i>What we do?</i>
2494992 2496693 Oh, god.
2496695 2498795 Juliet Sykes just<br />arrived at the party.
2498797 2500496 - Gross.<br />- Yeah.
2500498 2503199 The worst. I'm so<br />glad we didn't go.
2503201 2505468 Mm. Snapchat alert:
2505470 2508137 - Rob is totally puking in the kitchen sink.<br />- Oh, I wanna see that.
2508139 2510206 Could I see that?
2510208 2511808 Of course he is.
2511810 2513876 Ooh, I don't wanna see it.<br />Gross. Ew.
2515045 2517547 You kiss that? Mm.
2517549 2519315 I can't believe you<br />made this ice cream, ally.
2519317 2521050 It's literally better<br />than a restaurant's.
2521052 2523553 No, it's true. You should go to<br />cooking school. Screw college.
2523555 2525755 Thanks, guys.<br />It has no dairy.
2525757 2528391 Oh, you're so full of shit.
2528393 2529926 Thirty-eight.
2529928 2532862 - You can shut up now.<br />- What?
2532864 2536399 Matt's at the party.
2536401 2539168 Ally, you say "Matt" one more time,<br />and I will kill you in your sleep.
2539170 2542338 I will kill you in your sleep.<br />I will kill you in your sleep.
2544374 2547677 12:39. 12:39.
2571735 2574036 I wonder what filter<br />Terri uses on her photos.
2574038 2576806 - Major Fomo.<br />- Such a loser.
2576808 2578541 Steve's<br />flirting with a freshman.
2578543 2580209 I love you guys.
2581578 2583746 Oh, Sam.
2587151 2589418 - We love you too.<br />- Aw.
2589420 2591020 Weirdo.
2593991 2596225 Don't go emo on us.
2614312 2615478 Where's my phone?
2622853 2625087 Juliet Sykes is dead.
2640838 2642839 She killed herself.
2646443 2648444 Then nothing happened<br />to her at the party.
2648446 2652849 How totally insane.
2661158 2662859 Could our rose have something<br />to do with it?
2662861 2664460 Don't be stupid.
2668632 2670499 Imagine how her family feels.
2670501 2672501 Look, you can't be mean<br />to someone forever
2672503 2674670 and then just feel badly<br />when they die, okay?
2674672 2676472 We all knew she was crazy.
2678141 2680261 God, Lindsay, she was your<br />best friend in fifth grade.
2682079 2684680 Yeah, you used to sleep over her house.<br />I mean, you must know her...
2684682 2687683 Yeah, well, that was before<br />she became a sociopath, ally.
2687685 2689986 I'm going back to sleep.
2698929 2701063 I'm going to sleep in my room.
2706103 2708337 I'm going with her.
2716046 2718347 You were friends with Juliet?
2721118 2723286 No one even talked<br />to you in fifth grade,
2723288 2725855 and I don't hold that<br />against you.
2729526 2731294 You never said anything.
2733764 2736299 We made fun of her for all these<br />years... it's not our fault.
2751815 2753382 Go to sleep.
2811842 2814443 <i>I did everything right.</i>
2814445 2816612 <i>And nothing changed.</i>
2872102 2873335 Ugh!
2883046 2886248 <i>The day<br />starts and ends the same,</i>
2886250 2888684 <i>regardless<br />of anything I do or say.</i>
2890420 2892354 <i>If that's how it works,</i>
2892356 2895591 <i>I'm gonna do and say<br />whatever I want.</i>
2912809 2915478 - Oh, no, you're not wearing that to school.<br />- My cupid day outfit.
2915480 2917746 You don't want to give<br />people the wrong idea.
2917748 2919896 - What idea is that exactly?<br />-No, this is not happening.
2919898 2921283 Go back up<br />and change, please.
2921285 2924220 This is my life. I'll do whatever<br />the hell I want with it.
2925655 2927323 Dan, can you jump in here, please?<br />Sam,
2927325 2929291 it's so disrespectful to talk<br />to your mom... i don't care.
2929293 2931660 - Sam!<br />- I told you not to touch my stuff!
2931662 2933462 That's it!<br />You are grounded!
2933464 2935631 Grounded?
2935633 2936966 I'm already grounded.
2940570 2941637 Samantha!
2943673 2946275 <i>Maybe I was dead and in hell.</i>
2946277 2949145 <i>Maybe I was alive and in hell.</i>
2949147 2951080 <i>It didn't matter.</i>
2951948 2953849 <i>Nothing mattered anymore.</i>
2957988 2959755 What are you wearing?
2959757 2961423 Funny.
2963193 2965961 Excuse me.
2965963 2968631 Geez, wake up on the wrong<br />side of the bed or something?
2968633 2969999 For a few days now, yeah.
2970001 2972201 You ready?<br />Hey.
2973804 2975304 Hi. Sam.
2975306 2978440 Someone forgot to take her<br />happy pills this morning.
2978442 2980476 I took mine.
2980478 2982278 Well, I know something<br />that'll cheer you right up.
2982280 2984613 I swear to god, Elody, if you<br />hand me a condom right now...
2986349 2989485 But it's your present,<br />for your special night.
2989487 2992021 Take it.
2992023 2994790 Unless you want to be<br />a walking std farm.
2996026 2997793 You would know.
3001464 3003832 At least I'm not still a virgin.
3003834 3006235 What the hell is wrong with you?
3006237 3008671 What did you just say to me?
3008673 3012508 What is it? Do you feel like you need to<br />prove to us that you don't give a shit?
3012510 3014376 Is that what it is?
3014378 3016645 'Cause guess what. You don't<br />need to prove anything.
3016647 3020149 We all know that you don't give a<br />damn about anybody but yourself.
3020151 3022017 We're all pretty<br />fucking clear on that.
3022019 3023852 What the hell is<br />your problem today, Sam?
3023854 3026388 You guys, don't fight.<br />Just drop it.
3026390 3029024 - What, you don't agree?<br />- Leave her out of it.
3029026 3032561 Why? You're the one who talks shit<br />about both of them all the time.
3032563 3036532 "Look at Elody climbing all over Steve.<br />He doesn't even like her.
3036534 3039835 Look at ally. Oh my, god!<br />She's such a know-it-all.
3039837 3041704 She just loves<br />the sound of her own voice.
3041706 3044406 I hope Elody doesn't puke in my car again<br />and make it smell like alcoholic."
3044408 3046175 Stop it, Sam.
3049679 3051146 Out.
3052082 3053482 Get out!
3054050 3055684 Now!
3060924 3063425 I'd love to hear what you say<br />about me behind my back.
3085382 3088083 Sisyphus. Not an std.
3091255 3092721 Don't say it.
3096159 3098127 I'm in heteronormative hell.
3099996 3102231 Okay, thank you.<br />Thank you, girls. Thank you.
3103600 3105634 Okay, okay, let's hope<br />third time's the charm.
3105636 3107102 Okay?
3107104 3108404 Sisyphus.
3109639 3113075 Hey, what?<br />You can take 'em.
3113077 3115411 Oh, Sam, you're breaking<br />hearts left and right.
3121117 3123252 Am I breaking yours,<br />Mr. Daimler?
3125255 3126422 What?
3128191 3130159 Your heart.
3130161 3131760 Am I breaking it?
3140136 3143038 No, you're not.
3143040 3145674 My Patience, however,<br />is at its breaking point.
3145676 3147643 Take a seat.
3147645 3148944 Please.
3148946 3151313 If you insist.
3151315 3154283 Oh, my god.
3155985 3158454 Okay. Sisyphus.
3160857 3163192 Sisyphus.
3163194 3165527 Why is our friend Sisyphus<br />still relevant today?
3165529 3167796 Why's his story<br />still relevant today?
3251881 3254149 <i>Get this bitch on a leash!</i>
3254151 3256819 - Psycho!<br />- Psycho!
3264328 3265494 What the hell?<br />Shit!
3265496 3267463 What are you doing in here?
3270733 3274069 This is my bathroom.
3278508 3280075 Nice shoes.
3281244 3283078 Hard to walk in, huh?
3283080 3284913 I can walk in them<br />just fine, thank you.
3284915 3287182 Ah, you need a pair of these.
3288451 3290853 Comfiest shoes I ever owned.<br />Really?
3290855 3292788 All right, your loss.<br />Whatever.
3292790 3295357 You wanna trade?
3295359 3296925 Like switch shoes?
3298495 3301196 Come on, Kingston. See if I<br />can get in those without...
3301198 3303832 Just get out if... hurting myself.<br />Come on, let's try it.
3303834 3305834 Why not?<br />What?
3305836 3307202 Yeah, let's do it.
3307204 3309204 Come on!
3310874 3312774 Why do you guys hate me so much?
3317180 3319548 I know you know what's written<br />in this bathroom somewhere.
3323686 3325687 It's "ac..."
3327056 3330459 "Equals..."<br />"BD," right?
3330461 3334563 Anna Cartulo equals bull dyke.
3334565 3337232 I mean or maybe it's<br />"biggest douchebag."
3340169 3343038 But I reckon that honor definitely<br />belongs to Lindsay Edgecombe.
3348811 3350479 So is that it?
3352916 3354983 'Cause I'm gay?
3356486 3358153 I don't know.
3359989 3361823 Isn't that how<br />it always works out?
3361825 3364226 There's somebody laughing, there's<br />somebody being laughed at.
3366396 3367829 Right.
3370233 3372067 Look, whatever, really.
3372069 3376838 I mean, this whole high school<br />thing's just a blip.
3379375 3381476 I'm not gonna remember<br />any of you.
3384547 3386148 I win.
3391921 3396258 Do you ever feel like you're living<br />the same day over and over again
3396260 3400529 with only like a few things<br />being different?
3404801 3408503 Aw, shit, Samantha. You just<br />described my whole life!
3417580 3419448 Sam.<br />Stop it.
3448578 3449978 Hi, Sam.
3449980 3452080 You have to ask permission<br />to talk to me?
3454117 3458787 Lindsay's just really upset about<br />what you said. You should apologize.
3458789 3461356 Well, everything that<br />I said was true, so...
3461358 3464192 It doesn't matter if it's true.
3464194 3467195 She's Lindsay. She's ours.<br />We're each other's, you know?
3467197 3470932 Just apologize. You're not listening to me.<br />I'm not sorry.
3470934 3473435 Please, Sam?
3473437 3475937 What? Why do you care<br />so much, Elody?
3477807 3479107 Because...
3480209 3482177 You guys are all I have.
3498695 3500962 Are you still trying to<br />turn her against me?
3506803 3509071 You're the horrible driver.
3509073 3511873 You're the one who's always criticizing<br />people and hurting people.
3511875 3515243 You're the one who lied about being friends<br />with her and then tortured her for years.
3515245 3517279 I just followed along,<br />and yet...
3521317 3523285 I'm the one paying for it.
3525221 3529758 Sam, what are you talking about?<br />Whoa. What?
3529760 3533228 Oh, my god.
3540069 3542771 Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.<br />Where have you...
3557220 3558520 No!
3567196 3568964 Get this bitch on a leash!
3568966 3571933 I love you. Is that what<br />you wanted to hear?
3601831 3603565 Sam?
3621584 3624085 Hey, are...<br />Are you okay?
3625855 3630192 I mean, obviously you're crying.<br />Is there something I can do?
3630194 3632427 I'll get you a tissue.<br />Yeah, yeah. Um...
3634831 3636097 Hey, here.<br />Thanks.
3636099 3637866 Yeah.
3645474 3647709 Sorry I'm in your room.<br />I know there's a sign.
3647711 3650946 No, don't worry<br />about it. I...
3650948 3653882 The sign's just really for other<br />people so they don't get my stuff.
3656186 3659321 It's the first big party<br />I've ever had, so...
3659323 3661122 Why'd you have one now?
3664393 3666294 I figured if I had a party,<br />you'd come.
3676572 3679307 I like your room.<br />Yeah?
3679309 3681142 It's my dad's old den.
3682645 3684913 It must get a lot of light.
3684915 3687549 Yeah. It's like, uh...
3687551 3689484 Like waking up<br />in the middle of the sun.
3691754 3694256 I get to see the old tree.
3694258 3697325 I like it.<br />It's... it's constant.
3699829 3701396 Is that the one<br />we used to sit in?
3703099 3706768 Yeah. Yeah, we did.
3706770 3709771 Do you, uh... do you<br />remember climbing up it?
3709773 3712774 And then you jumped down<br />and sprained your ankle?
3712776 3715777 I was stupid.
3715779 3717846 It was very ambitious.
3720416 3722751 - I should go.<br />- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
3722753 3725186 Just stay for a second, okay?
3729558 3732294 I-I can... I can<br />drive you home or...
3732296 3734029 I don't want to go home.
3737533 3741503 Okay, well, you can, uh... you<br />could crash here if you want.
3742972 3745907 Not, not, not like...<br />Like with me. I...
3745909 3748643 Somewhere else.<br />I'll-I'll be somewhere else.
3748645 3752113 Like bed,<br />completely to yourself.
3752115 3755116 The Kent Mcfuller master suite.
3760122 3761189 Yeah?
3762258 3763558 Okay.
3764727 3767529 Hey, it's okay.
3775237 3776571 Here.
3786749 3788550 I'm sorry about earlier.
3789685 3792220 Don't worry about it.<br />No, I'm sorry...
3793456 3795423 I've always been so mean to you.
3801097 3803765 Don't look. Don't read it.<br />Please? Why? It's...
3803767 3805333 It's something bad.
3807703 3808870 Okay.
3814210 3816444 Your skin's so hot.
3816446 3820515 It's, uh...<br />It's always like that.
3835064 3837298 I wish we could be here forever.
3856153 3858420 Okay, let's try again.<br />Hmm.
3858422 3860855 Aah.
3863026 3865326 We're taking a day off.
3865328 3868830 I think you're just<br />going to drool around.
3868832 3873001 What does that... and then you're just<br />going to go through there and end up here.
3873003 3875670 <i>If I was going to relive<br />the same day over and over...</i>
3877206 3879107 <i>I wanted it to be a worthy day.</i>
3887616 3889517 <i>But not just for me.</i>
3907903 3910672 Do the kids at school ever make fun<br />of you for the way that you talk?
3913609 3915043 Sometimes.
3917646 3919547 <i>You can do something about that.</i>
3921250 3924385 <i>You know, you can learn<br />to talk differently.</i>
3924387 3927722 But this is my voice. How can<br />they even know it's me talking?
3929892 3931826 When I was in the fifth grade,
3933729 3935897 this girl used to<br />sing this song...
3942606 3944239 who did that?
3945741 3947142 Lindsay.
3952148 3954315 <i>How come you're so mean to mom?</i>
3958354 3961089 I'm not mean to mom.
3961091 3964592 You drew a line on the floor with nail<br />Polish and said you couldn't cross it.
3966929 3970765 Mom and I had a fight, and I was mad<br />at her in the moment, but I didn't...
3973035 3975737 I didn't think that<br />she'd actually stay away.
3981877 3983444 <i>Look at that.</i>
3983446 3985480 What? That's just the<br />outside, how pretty it was.
3985482 3988183 Oh, my gosh. Look at you guys.<br />Can you send those to me?
3988185 3990852 Oh! Those are beautiful.
3990854 3993488 Remember when you used to<br />come here all the time?
3993490 3995356 I do. Of course.
3995358 3998526 Then your daughter<br />got too cool, so...
3998528 4000495 - I'm just kidding.<br />- Can we go watch the pizza?
4000497 4003131 Okay. Wait, tiger.
4008637 4009904 I'm glad we did this.
4009906 4012006 Yeah.
4012008 4013775 It was just really sweet<br />what you did today.
4019048 4020288 Do you think I'm a good person?
4023586 4026721 Of course I think you're<br />a good person.
4026723 4029724 But it doesn't really matter<br />what I think.
4029726 4031593 I mean, what's important<br />is what you think.
4031595 4033328 No, I'm serious.<br />I want to know...
4035097 4037131 Why do you think that<br />I'm a good person?
4043872 4046874 Do you remember when<br />you were a little girl,
4046876 4050245 you used to take turns riding<br />all of the horses in the stable
4050247 4052580 so that none of them<br />would feel left out?
4052582 4054582 Do you remember that?
4054584 4056517 I do.<br />Mm-hmm.
4058287 4060688 But I was a little girl.
4060690 4062690 It's different.
4062692 4065860 You have a big heart, Sam.<br />That doesn't go away.
4068230 4070031 One good thing.
4070033 4074802 You just focus on<br />that one good thing,
4074804 4076771 and you see where it leads you.
4090486 4093087 <i>How is it possible<br />to change so much</i>
4093089 4095523 <i>and not be able to change<br />anything at all?</i>
4103667 4106134 <i>I knew I had to do something.</i>
4108070 4109871 <i>Something good.</i>
4136098 4138099 Whoo!
4163325 4164692 You made it.
4164694 4166961 Oh, sorry.
4166963 4168996 The room's off-limits.
4168998 4172166 Oh, forget the sign.<br />It's no big deal.
4172168 4175303 That's really just there for other<br />people so they don't mess with my stuff.
4176538 4180074 I'm glad you came.<br />Yeah. I had to.
4180076 4181376 I like what you've<br />done with the place.
4181378 4185880 Yeah. Yeah, this used<br />to be my dad's old den.
4185882 4189016 Now it's the, uh... the Kent<br />Mcfuller master suite.
4190553 4192487 Yeah, not so good<br />in the morning, though.
4194923 4197425 - It's like waking up...<br />- In the middle of the sun.
4202331 4203731 Yeah.
4210606 4215109 I hope you don't think that it's weird<br />that I'm here with you right now.
4216378 4218312 Sam, um...
4219615 4223518 I once wore crocs<br />for 365 days straight,
4223520 4227221 so I don't think<br />anything's weird.
4227223 4230258 I forgot about your crocs phase.<br />Yeah.
4237466 4240034 Why are you always<br />so nice to me?
4245040 4247708 Uh, well...
4247710 4251245 Do you remember in third grade
4251247 4253614 right after my dad died?
4253616 4259454 We were in the cafeteria<br />and I was crying.
4259456 4264892 And Phil Howe came up to me,<br />called me a baby,
4264894 4268329 and then smacked my tray<br />right out of my hand,
4268331 4271632 and food went flying everywhere.
4272835 4274602 I remember what<br />we were eating too.
4274604 4277171 It was, um, mashed potatoes<br />and Turkey burgers.
4277173 4281275 And you came over,
4281277 4284779 you scooped up the mashed<br />potatoes right off the ground
4284781 4289817 and you went up to Phil and you smashed<br />the mashed potatoes right in his face.
4291521 4295156 And you-you then said, "you're<br />worse than a hot lunch,"
4295158 4299594 which, at the time,<br />was a really good insult.
4299596 4303331 I mean, I didn't laugh<br />more that day than...
4303333 4304932 I mean, uh...
4308337 4312206 It was... it was the first<br />time I laughed since my...
4312208 4314108 My dad died and i...
4319548 4321449 Do you remember<br />what I said to you?
4328156 4330458 "You're my hero."
4330460 4331859 Yeah.
4334396 4337198 And that day, I-i vowed<br />to be your hero too.
4339735 4341469 No matter how long it took.
4353148 4354815 I'm sorry.
4354817 4357718 No, don't do... don't be sorry.
4357720 4359153 It's okay.
4360889 4362490 Good.
4363692 4365593 'Cause I'm not really sorry.
4389285 4390785 Shit.<br />Wait. I...
4397926 4400127 Sam! Hey!
4400129 4401929 Sam! Wait, i...
4403198 4405366 Oh, my god!<br />Sam, did you see that?
4405368 4407935 Hey. Hey, Sam.
4407937 4409971 Did you see where Juliet went?
4411607 4413274 Juliet, stop!
4420082 4421449 Juliet!
4422985 4425052 Juliet! Wait!
4435664 4436964 Juliet!
4488151 4490017 Juliet!
4495724 4497458 Juliet!
4504299 4506534 Juliet.<br />What are you doing here?
4506536 4508803 I know what happened back there.<br />Get away from me.
4508805 4511205 And I feel really bad about it,<br />and I know this may sound crazy,
4511207 4513307 but I have a feeling I may be<br />able to understand you
4513309 4516477 better than you think that I could.<br />You hate me.
4520549 4522917 I don't hate you.
4522919 4525386 I know we haven't always<br />been the nicest to you,
4525388 4528923 but the thing is that Lindsay<br />didn't mean anything by it.
4528925 4530357 We didn't know what we were doing.<br />No.
4530359 4534528 I used to be friends<br />with Lindsay.
4534530 4536931 It was right before<br />her parents got divorced.
4536933 4540334 I used to sleep over at her house. Her<br />parents would be fighting so bad.
4542070 4543771 She was so upset.
4546374 4549310 She was so upset<br />she started wetting the bed.
4551079 4554415 You remember the name you all<br />gave me in fifth grade,
4554417 4556350 the name Lindsay gave me.
4558286 4560788 Mellow yellow.
4560790 4562957 Remember that?
4562959 4565793 You remember the camping trip when I<br />supposedly peed in my sleeping bag?
4565795 4568295 It was Lindsay.
4568297 4570431 Lindsay's the one who peed.
4573068 4576203 When everyone asked what happened, she just<br />pointed her finger at me and screamed,
4576205 4577872 "she did it."
4579274 4580441 Juliet...
4583545 4585045 Please let me help you.
4589217 4591886 It doesn't matter now.
4599294 4600728 You...
4605433 4606801 I...
4609604 4614241 Hey, it's like<br />your val-a-gram always said.
4616611 4621081 "Maybe next year, but...
4622951 4624518 Probably not."
4625620 4627188 Juliet...
4638867 4640835 Oh!
4671867 4674134 <i>For the first time,<br />when I wake up...</i>
4675871 4677304 <i>I'm not scared...</i>
4678640 4680207 <i>Or confused...</i>
4681343 4682977 <i>Or angry.</i>
4687916 4690351 <i>Because, for the first time,</i>
4690353 4693153 <i>I truly understand<br />what needs to happen.</i>
4704499 4707234 <i>I truly understand<br />how to live this day.</i>
4713675 4716944 - Uh, Friday, right?<br />- Yes.
4719949 4721849 Oh, thank you.<br />Yeah.
4721851 4724718 You want something to eat?
4724720 4727454 I'm good. Thanks.<br />Lindsay's got it covered.
4727456 4729390 Mom?<br />Oh.
4729392 4731292 I love you.

4766962 4768896 Always remember that.
4776304 4777671 Oh.
4778974 4781542 Ugh, I can't breathe!
4797359 4799560 It's cold!<br />Yeah.
4839868 4841668 What are you doing?
4841670 4845372 Auditioning for a Tampax<br />commercial? Let's go.
4856584 4859586 Yeah, baby!
4859588 4862723 Hey! Hey, get in!
4865194 4867995 You know how I like it.
4875070 4878739 Hey, Elody. What, do I have<br />white stuff on my face?
4878741 4880407 No. You know<br />why I love you?
4882077 4885279 I love you because you're<br />down for anything. Always.
4885281 4887581 You know I'm a down-ass bitch.
4887583 4890117 - You are.<br />- Hey, I'm down too.
4890119 4893587 No. Okay.
4893589 4897691 No, I love you, ally, because<br />you're curious about the world.
4899527 4901895 And you're passionate,<br />and you are driven.
4901897 4903897 Did someone swallow<br />Oprah this morning?
4908103 4909670 I love you, Linds.
4911072 4913907 I love you because<br />you're the kind of friend
4913909 4917411 that toilet papers Jason foster's house<br />for a week straight all by herself
4917413 4919173 just because he said<br />that I was a bad kisser.
4921951 4923217 Asshole.
4928590 4932392 Oh, uh, I think I know why<br />Sam's in such a good mood.
4935663 4937498 Oh.<br />It goes on him.
4946407 4948809 I've been looking for it<br />everywhere. I can't find it.
4950345 4952312 Thank you so much for that.
4966828 4968629 Sisyphus.
4968631 4971932 - Not an std. -Sorry. It was an<br />emergency in the<i> tribulation.</i>
4971934 4974201 A minor laserjet explosion.
4974203 4976436 Val-a-gram delivery.<br />- Happy cupid day.
4978506 4980040 It's so beautiful.
4980042 4982176 - I'm in heteronormative hell.<br />- I like your boots.
4982178 4983977 Sisyphus.

5017812 5021215 Hey, listen, um, I'm, uh... I'm<br />having a party tonight. Mm-hmm.

5024553 5026386 come, maybe.
5026388 5027921 Yeah? No?
5027923 5030023 What's in it for me?
5030025 5033827 I... what's in it for me?
5033829 5036930 Um... yeah.
5036932 5040434 And, um, I have something I want<br />to tell you later. A secret.
5040436 5041668 Later?<br />Yeah.

5046041 5049176 Thank you for my beautiful rose.<br />I love it.
5055918 5057584 What'd you say to me?
5057586 5059586 This is not working out.
5059588 5062222 Okay, Sam, you can't<br />break up with me.
5062224 5067361 I think I can<br />and I-i think I just did.
5069464 5070964 I should have picked Elody.
5076971 5078805 What just happened?
5078807 5082209 You guys were supposed to...<br />I mean you said you wanted to...
5084245 5087147 It's Rob Cokran.
5087149 5090984 - He doesn't deserve me.<br />- Nonetheless, very shocking.
5090986 5093720 Sociopath, 12 o'clock.
5093722 5096390 - Uh-oh.<br />- Does it smell like pee in here?
5096392 5097791 Stop.
5097793 5099526 Norma bates!<br />What?
5100828 5102496 Just don't.
5102498 5105399 - But it's Juliet.<br />- Exactly.
5105401 5109436 It's Juliet. She has a<br />name and she is a person.
5109438 5112806 Yesterday you said you were afraid she<br />would bite you if she got too close.
5114676 5116410 That was a long time ago.
5118846 5120414 That was yesterday.
5164792 5167127 - Hey, Linds.<br />- All right, let's do this.
5167129 5169496 Linds?<br />What?
5169498 5171898 How come you never told me<br />about your parents' divorce?
5171900 5174801 Are you serious?
5176137 5177471 Yeah.
5179674 5182609 Why would I talk about something<br />that happened a thousand years ago?
5183978 5185946 Because it happened to you.
5187014 5188548 And you matter to me.
5188550 5190817 I don't know what you're talking about.<br />Let's go inside.
5190819 5192486 Come here.
5195423 5199192 You know you don't have to act<br />so tough all the time.
5203765 5205665 Don't worry about me, okay?
5207535 5210904 Well, I love you no matter what.<br />Let's get inside.
5210906 5212739 Move, move, move.
5221016 5223350 Hey, um, you made it.
5223352 5226520 Come with me.<br />What? Uh, okay.
5227855 5229022 Okay.
5233728 5236730 I-I-i believe you<br />owe me a secret, right?
5236732 5238198 I believe I do.
5238200 5240133 Okay, so let's hear it.
5244306 5246039 The secret is...
5247742 5251378 Yours was the best kiss that<br />I've ever had in my entire life.
5254549 5259619 Um, but we haven't...<br />We haven't kissed.
5263157 5265225 I mean,<br />not since the third grade.
5267662 5270831 Better get started then.<br />I haven't much time.
5304867 5306299 Because I wanted to.
5329156 5331658 Juliet, I need to talk to you.
5331660 5334961 For a second. It's okay. Please. Actually,<br />I kind of have somewhere I have to be.
5334963 5337130 I know what you<br />have planned for tonight.
5337132 5340967 And I want you to know that you don't have<br />to do this, okay? You don't know anything.
5340969 5343336 I know that you have<br />something to tell me.
5343338 5346306 You have something to tell all of us.<br />You're a bitch.
5348576 5351177 I have been a bitch.
5351179 5354748 I have been a bitch. We all have been<br />bitches. And I'm sorry. I have to go.
5354750 5357384 I'm trying to tell you how sorry...<br />I am sorry. You said that.
5357386 5360020 Sorry, but I have to come with you.<br />Leave me alone!
5360022 5361555 I can't.<br />Sam!
5361557 5363490 Sam, why did you run away from me?<br />I can't right now.
5363492 5366760 You've been ignoring me for<br />years, and then you kiss me
5366762 5370263 and then go back to acting... i meant<br />everything that happened back there.
5370265 5373700 That's all I can say, that I meant it,<br />and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.
5373702 5378605 Are you in trouble?<br />Uh, you can... you can trust me.
5385379 5386513 Juliet!
5389383 5390951 Juliet!
5398527 5399527 Juliet!
5412407 5414441 Juliet, don't!
5415309 5417110 Wait! Wait!
5417112 5420313 Wh-what's going on?<br />Why are you following me?
5420315 5421915 Why can't you leave me alone?
5421917 5424050 You don't want to die.
5424052 5427454 You want the pain to stop.
5427456 5431725 Stop. You stop.<br />You... you don't know me.
5431727 5433793 You could never understand.
5433795 5435762 You have a choice, Juliet.
5435764 5437263 Not everybody gets that.
5437265 5438665 Sam!
5440635 5442135 Please let me help you.
5442137 5444804 Don't you get it?
5444806 5446906 You can't help me.
5448009 5450110 I can't be fixed.
5450112 5453079 You're not the one who needs fixing.<br />There is nothing wrong with you.
5453081 5455081 Don't let anyone<br />tell you that there is.
5458119 5463923 This is just a blip. Your<br />life will change, Juliet,
5463925 5467193 if you just hold on...
5467195 5469029 For one more minute.
5476037 5478471 It's too late for that.
5478473 5481608 No, it's not.<br />It's never too late.
5486380 5488014 Juliet, stop!
5501862 5504464 <i>Maybe for you,<br />there's a tomorrow.</i>
5506034 5508234 <i>Maybe for you, there's 1,000...</i>
5508236 5511204 <i>Or 3,000.</i>
5513307 5514708 <i>Or ten.</i>
5517578 5520046 <i>But for some of us,</i>
5520048 5521715 <i>there's only today.</i>
5523050 5526252 <i>And what you do today matters...</i>
5526254 5527954 <i>In the moment...</i>
5530157 5532158 <i>And maybe into infinity.</i>
5534428 5536763 <i>I see only my greatest hits.</i>
5546741 5548742 <i>I see the things<br />I want to remember...</i>
5553047 5554848 <i>And be remembered for.</i>
5562123 5565525 <i>That's when I realized that<br />certain moments go on forever.</i>
5568863 5571331 <i>Even after they're over,<br />they still go on.</i>
5574735 5576369 <i>They are the meaning.</i>
5578639 5579706 Sam?
5581408 5582809 Sam?
5585079 5586713 You saved me.
5589617 5591117 <i>No.</i>
5592453 5594387 <i>You saved me.</i>
