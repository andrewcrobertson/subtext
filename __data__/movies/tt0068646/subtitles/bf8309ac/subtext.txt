76543 79379 I believe in America.
79463 82424 America has made my fortune.
82508 86637 And I raised my daughter<br />in the American fashion.
86720 91558 I gave her freedom, but I taught her<br />never to dishonor her family.
93018 96146 She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.
96230 100651 She went to the movies with him.<br />She stayed out late.
100734 102444 I didn't protest.
103529 108242 Two months ago he took her for a drive<br />with another boyfriend.
109284 111912 They made her drink whiskey
111995 116375 and then they tried to<br />take advantage of her.
116458 120587 She resisted, she kept her honor.
121922 124925 So they beat her like an animal.
126760 131723 When I went to the hospital,<br />her nose was broken,
131807 136270 her jaw was shattered,<br />held together by wire.
138480 141900 She couldn't even weep<br />because of the pain.
143944 147447 But I wept. Why did I weep?
150117 152452 She was the light of my life.
154413 156123 Beautiful girl.
159793 162754 Now she will never be beautiful again.
169303 170679 Sorry.
178979 183650 I went to the police,<br />like a good American.
183734 186403 These two boys were brought to trial.
187487 190282 The judge sentenced them<br />to three years in prison,
190365 192492 but suspended the sentence.
193660 198665 Suspended the sentence!<br />They went free that very day!
200959 204254 I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
204338 207841 Those two bastards, they smiled at me.
209092 214681 Then I said to my wife, " For justice,<br />we must go to Don Corleone."
220103 224483 Why did you go to the police?<br />Why didn't you come to me first?
224608 230697 What do you want of me? Tell me<br />anything, but do what I beg you to do.
230781 232449 What is that?
243585 245420 I want them dead.
257057 258850 That I cannot do.
260185 262688 I 'll give you anything you ask.
264982 270612 I've known you many years, but this<br />is the first time you've asked for help.
271780 276827 I can't remember the last time<br />you invited me for a cup of coffee.
277995 281748 Even though my wife is godmother<br />to your only child.
281832 286837 But let's be frank here.<br />You never wanted my friendship.
286920 290674 And you were afraid to be in my debt.
290757 293176 I didn't want to get into trouble.
294302 295929 I understand.
297431 300308 You found Paradise in America.
302602 307274 You made a good living, had police<br />protection and there were courts of law.
307357 310068 You didn't need a friend like me.
311611 315282 But now you come to me and say,
315365 317784 "Don Corleone, give me justice."
319703 322539 But you don't ask with respect.
322622 327335 You don't offer friendship. You don't<br />even think to call me Godfather.
329046 335927 You come on my daughter's wedding<br />day and ask me to murder for money.
336011 338555 I ask you for justice.
338638 341641 That is not justice.<br />Your daughter is alive.
342684 346146 Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.
348273 350567 How much shall I pay you?
365248 369169 Bonasera, Bonasera.
369252 373340 What have I ever done to make you<br />treat me so disrespectfully?
374466 377010 If you'd come in friendship,
377094 381515 the scum that ruined your daughter<br />would be suffering this very day.
382641 387813 And if an honest man like you should<br />make enemies, they'd be my enemies.
390732 393568 And then they would fear you.
397072 399199 Be my friend?
403161 404704 Godfather?
409042 410252 Good.
412379 417551 Some day, and that day may never<br />come, I 'll ask a service of you.
418927 421054 But until that day
422848 427144 accept this justice as a gift<br />on my daughter's wedding day.
427227 429646 <i>- Gràzie, Godfather.<br />- Prego.</i>
436695 439406 Give this to Clemenza.
441700 445162 I want people that aren't going to<br />get carried away.
445245 449416 We're not murderers,<br />in spite of what this undertaker says.
474691 478111 - Where's Michael?<br />- Don't worry, he'll be here.
479237 482324 We're not taking the picture<br />without Michael.
488663 491124 - What's the matter?<br />- It's Michael.
540799 542467 Don Barzini.
558775 562153 Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.
562237 564489 Paulie! More wine.
566324 571538 - You look terrific on the floor.<br />- Are you a dance judge or something?
571621 573873 Take a walk and do your job.
581631 584884 Sandra, watch the kids.<br />Don't let them run wild.
584968 587429 You watch yourself, all right?
608575 612829 20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.
613788 616166 In that little silk purse.
616249 619836 <i>If this were somebody else's wedding…<br />Sfortunato!</i>
619919 621171 Hey, Paulie!
621254 625050 I got two gabagool, capocol,<br />and a prosciut.
625133 626217 Stupid jerk!
635352 637270 What's the matter?
649532 652118 - Have to go back to work.<br />- Tom.
652202 656456 No Sicilian can refuse any request<br />on his daughter's wedding day.
662170 667300 Don Corleone, I'm honored and<br />grateful that you have invited me.
672138 675350 Get out of here!<br />It's a private party. Go on!
676434 679396 What is it? It's my sister's wedding.
685985 688696 Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!
691699 695078 Come here, come here, come here!
709342 713888 …but towards the end, he was paroled<br />to help with the American war effort,
713972 717058 so for six months<br />he's worked in my pastry shop.
717142 719894 Nazorine, what can I do for you?
719978 721938 Now that the war is over,
722021 726025 this boy, Enzo, they want to<br />repatriate him back to Italy.
726109 730989 Godfather, I have a daughter.<br />You see, she and Enzo…
732198 736703 You want Enzo to stay in this country,<br />and your daughter to be married.
737871 740165 You understand everything.
740999 743376 Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
746504 750467 Wait till you see the wedding cake<br />I made for your daughter!
750550 753303 The bride, the groom and the angel…
758558 763104 - Who should I give this job to?<br />- Not to our paisan.
763188 768318 Give it to a Jew Congressman in<br />another district. Who else is on the list?
775366 776951 Hey, Michael!
796763 800225 He's not on the list,<br />but Luca Brasi wants to see you.
806064 808441 Is this necessary?
808525 813154 He didn't expect to be invited to the<br />wedding, so he wanted to thank you.
814489 819911 Don Corleone, I'm honored and<br />grateful that you have invited me
819994 822830 on the wedding day of your daughter.
822914 825333 May their first child<br />be a masculine child.
826543 827961 Michael…
829754 833132 That man over there<br />is talking to himself.
833216 836052 See that scary guy over there?
836135 839639 - He's a very scary guy.<br />- What's his name?
839722 844394 His name is Luca Brasi.<br />He helps my father out sometimes.
846187 849107 Michael, he's coming over here!
853444 855280 You look terrific!
855363 858658 My brother Tom Hagen,<br />Miss Kay Adams.
860410 862662 Your father's been asking for you.
862745 865582 - Very nice to meet you.<br />- Nice to meet you.
867333 870044 Why does your brother<br />have a different name?
870169 874007 My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen<br />in the street.
874090 878011 He had no home,<br />so my father took him in.
879762 882849 He's been with us ever since.
882932 884892 He's a good lawyer.
885727 890315 Not a Sicilian. I think<br />he's going to be consigliere.
890398 893318 - What's that?<br />- That's a,
893401 897196 like a counselor, an advisor.<br />Very important for the family.
898197 900366 You like your lasagna?
904621 906831 Don Corleone.
906914 909584 I'm honored and grateful
909667 913504 that you have invited me<br />to your daughter's wedding.
918509 921804 On the day of your daughter's wedding.
921888 926726 And I hope that their first child<br />will be a masculine child.
928144 933274 I pledge my ever -ending loyalty.
935234 940657 - For your daughter's bridal purse.<br />- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.
940740 945870 Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you<br />now, because I know you're busy.
946412 947747 Thank you.
997255 999590 Signora Corleone!
1000800 1003636 No!
1072747 1077835 Senator Cauley apologized for not<br />coming, but said you'd understand.
1077919 1082173 Also some of the judges.<br />They've all sent gifts.
1085218 1086427 What is that outside?
1095520 1100066 Johnny! Johnny!
1101108 1102777 I love you!
1113079 1116499 He came all the way from California.<br />I told you he'd come!
1116582 1120086 - He's probably in trouble again.<br />- He's a good godson.
1121087 1125424 Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!
1141440 1143860 You never said<br />you knew Johnny Fontane!
1143943 1148030 - Sure. You want to meet him?<br />- Great! Sure.
1148114 1151951 - My father helped him with his career.<br />- He did?
1152034 1153119 How?
1155663 1158499 - Let's listen to this song.<br />- Michael…
1191824 1193993 Please, Michael. Tell me.
1197496 1202543 When Johnny was starting out, he was<br />signed to a personal service contract
1202627 1205504 with a big bandleader.
1205630 1209842 And as his career got better and better,<br />he wanted to get out of it.
1210885 1213596 Johnny is my father's godson.
1213679 1217016 My father went to see this bandleader.
1217099 1220978 He offered him $ 10,000<br />to let Johnny go,
1221062 1223814 but the bandleader said no.
1223898 1229278 So the next day my father went to see<br />him, but this time with Luca Brasi.
1231030 1233282 Within an hour,
1233366 1238871 he signed a release<br />for a certified check of $ 1,000.
1240873 1244835 - How did he do that?<br />- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
1246504 1251384 - What was that?<br />- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,
1251509 1256722 and father said that either his brains or<br />his signature would be on the contract.
1261727 1263354 That's a true story.
1274782 1277451 That's my family, Kay. It's not me.
1289964 1291716 Beautiful!
1323956 1326083 I'll take care of it.
1326167 1328044 Tom…
1328127 1331839 I want you to find Santino.<br />Tell him to come to the office.
1339096 1342058 How are you, Fredo?
1342141 1344727 My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.
1345811 1348105 - Hi.<br />- How are you doing?
1350066 1354570 - This is my brother Mike.<br />- Are you having a good time?
1354653 1357239 Yeah. This is your friend?
1357323 1361994 I don't know what to do.<br />My voice is weak. It's weak.
1363704 1370169 Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,<br />it puts me right back on top again.
1370252 1375591 But this… man won't give it to me,<br />the head of the studio.
1375674 1378928 - What's his name?<br />- Woltz.
1379011 1383182 He won't give it to me,<br />and he says there's no chance.
1387436 1388729 Sonny?
1390356 1391524 Sonny?
1397947 1399198 Sonny?
1400032 1402785 - Sonny, are you in there?<br />- What?
1402868 1404745 The old man wants you.
1405996 1407706 One minute.
1422138 1427184 A month ago he bought the movie rights<br />to this book, a best -seller.
1427268 1430855 The main character<br />is a guy just like me.
1430938 1433607 I wouldn't even have to act.
1434567 1437403 Godfather, I don't know what to do.
1438696 1442992 You can act like a man!<br />What's the matter with you?
1443075 1448789 Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood<br />finocchio that cries like a woman?
1448873 1452918 "What can I do? What can I do?"<br />What is that nonsense?
1453002 1454712 Ridiculous.
1459425 1462553 - You spend time with your family?<br />- Sure I do.
1462636 1464263 Good.
1464305 1469018 Because a man who doesn't spend time<br />with his family can never be a real man.
1474648 1478110 You look terrible. I want you to eat.
1478194 1483490 Rest, and in a month this Hollywood<br />big shot will give you what you want.
1483574 1486702 It's too late,<br />they start shooting in a week.
1486785 1489955 I'm going to make him an offer<br />he can't refuse.
1492791 1497796 Just go outside and enjoy yourself,<br />and forget about all this nonsense.
1499965 1503010 - I want you to leave it all to me.<br />- All right.
1528077 1533374 - What time does my daughter leave?<br />- Soon, after they cut the cake.
1533457 1537086 Do we give your son -in -law<br />something important?
1537169 1542508 Never. Give him a living, but never<br />discuss the family business with him.
1542591 1545386 - What else?<br />- Virgil Sollozzo called.
1545511 1549932 - We'll have to see him next week.<br />- When you come back from California.
1551308 1554436 - When am I going to California?<br />- Tonight.
1554561 1559858 I want you to talk to this movie big shot<br />and settle this business for Johnny.
1561193 1565322 If there's nothing else, I 'd like to go<br />to my daughter's wedding.
1567491 1570452 Carlo, we're going to take the picture.
1571495 1573289 Wait a minute.
1573372 1575666 No, Michael. Not me.
1580170 1583048 Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!
1693200 1696370 - You need a little more heat on that arc.<br />- Start talking.
1696453 1699873 I was sent by a friend<br />of Johnny Fontane.
1699957 1703710 This friend would give<br />his friendship to Mr. Woltz,
1703794 1706630 if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.
1706713 1709049 Woltz is listening.
1709133 1713220 Give Johnny the part in that war film<br />you're starting next week.
1718934 1723939 And what favor would your friend<br />grant Mr. Woltz?
1724022 1727568 He could make your future union<br />problems disappear.
1727651 1731738 And one of your stars has just moved<br />from marijuana to heroin.
1731822 1736118 Are you trying to muscle me?<br />Listen, you son -of-a -bitch!
1736201 1738787 Let me lay it on the line.
1738871 1740873 Johnny Fontane<br />will never get that movie!
1740998 1745502 No matter how many Dago Guinea<br />greaseballs come out of the woodwork!
1745586 1749423 - I'm German -Irish.<br />- Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend.
1749506 1753886 - I'm going to make trouble for you!<br />- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened…
1753969 1757347 I know New York's big lawyers.<br />Who are you?
1757431 1760976 I have a special practice.<br />I handle one client.
1761059 1763061 I'll wait for your call.
1764813 1767774 By the way,<br />I admire your pictures very much.
1772571 1774072 Check him out.
1796595 1799139 - It's really beautiful.<br />- Look at this.
1799223 1803727 - It used to decorate a king's palace.<br />- Very nice.
1803810 1806188 Why didn't you say<br />you work for Corleone?
1806313 1810526 I thought you were some cheap hustler<br />Johnny was running in.
1810609 1813946 - I only use his name when necessary.<br />- How's your drink?
1814071 1817533 - Fine.<br />- Now I'll show you something beautiful.
1817616 1820202 You do appreciate beauty, don't you?
1823163 1826208 There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.
1826291 1830254 I bet Russian czars never paid<br />that for a single horse.
1830337 1831880 Khartoum.
1832506 1833799 Khartoum.
1835342 1839721 I'm not going to race him, though.<br />I'm going to put him out to stud.
1841306 1842849 Thanks, Tony.
1843642 1846562 Let's get something to eat.
1846645 1850065 Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
1850148 1854570 To the Italian people that's<br />a very sacred, close relationship.
1854653 1858574 I respect it.<br />Tell him to ask me anything else.
1858657 1860993 This favor I can't give him.
1861076 1864371 He never asks a second favor<br />when he's been refused the first.
1864496 1870627 You don't understand.<br />Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
1870711 1874381 That part is perfect for him.<br />It'll make him a big star.
1874506 1878594 I'm going to run him out of the business,<br />and let me tell you why.
1880596 1885267 Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz<br />International's most valuable protégés.
1885350 1890731 We trained her for five years.<br />Singing, acting, dancing lessons.
1890856 1895444 I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars<br />on her, to make her a big star.
1895527 1898322 Let me be even more frank.
1898405 1903410 To show you that I'm not a hard -hearted<br />man. That it's not all dollars and cents.
1903493 1907122 She was beautiful.<br />She was young and innocent!
1907205 1912628 She's the greatest piece of ass I've had<br />and I've had them all over the world.
1912711 1918842 Then Johnny Fontane comes along with<br />his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
1918925 1920636 And she runs off.
1921970 1926058 She threw it all away<br />just to make me look ridiculous!
1926141 1931313 And a man in my position can't afford<br />to be made to look ridiculous!
1931396 1933732 You get the hell out of here!
1933815 1938195 If that goombah tries any rough stuff,<br />tell him I'm no bandleader.
1939488 1942491 Yeah, I heard that story.
1943325 1947329 Thank you for dinner<br />and a very pleasant evening.
1947412 1950290 Maybe your car can take me<br />to the airport.
1950374 1953960 Mr. Corleone insists on hearing<br />bad news immediately.
2066656 2070577 - You're not too tired, are you, Tom?<br />- No, I slept on the plane.
2070660 2073747 I have the Sollozzo notes here.
2073830 2075081 Now…
2077042 2080629 Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
2080712 2082672 He's supposed to be very good<br />with a knife,
2082756 2087177 <i>but only in matters of business<br />with reasonable complaint.</i>
2087260 2090514 <i>His business is narcotics.</i>
2090597 2093975 <i>He has fields in Turkey,<br />where they grow poppy.</i>
2094059 2097896 <i>In Sicily he has plants<br />to process them into heroin.</i>
2097979 2101483 <i>He needs cash,<br />he needs protection from the police.</i>
2101566 2105487 <i>He'll give a piece of the action.<br />I don't know how much.</i>
2105612 2110826 <i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.<br />They have to be in it for something.</i>
2112118 2116706 - What about his prison record?<br />- One term in Italy, one here.
2116790 2119543 He's known as a top narcotics man.
2119626 2124297 - Santino, what do you think?<br />- A lot of money in that white powder.
2126633 2128009 Tom?
2128093 2132264 <i>Yes. There's more money in narcotics<br />than anything else.</i>
2132347 2137102 <i>If we don't get into it, somebody else<br />will, maybe the five families.</i>
2137185 2141648 With that money they can buy<br />more police and political power.
2141731 2143817 Then they come after us.
2143942 2150448 Now we have unions and gambling, and<br />that's great, but narcotics is the future.
2150532 2155662 If we don't get a piece of that action,<br />we risk everything in 10 years' time.
2160208 2163295 So? What's your answer<br />going to be, Pop?
2168049 2169801 Don Corleone.
2171887 2175181 I need a man who has powerful friends.
2175307 2178018 I need a million dollars in cash.
2178101 2183940 I need those politicians that you carry<br />in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.
2185400 2189404 - What is the interest for my family?<br />- 30%.
2189487 2193450 In the first year your end should be<br />three, four million dollars.
2193533 2195535 And then it would go up.
2196745 2200165 And what is the interest<br />for the Tattaglia family?
2202167 2204002 My compliments.
2207672 2211092 I'll take care of them, out of my share.
2211176 2215472 So I receive 30% for finance,
2215555 2218892 political influence and legal protection?
2218975 2220685 That's right.
2221978 2225899 Why do you come to me?<br />Why do I deserve this generosity?
2225982 2231279 If you consider a million dollars in cash<br />just finance,
2231363 2233531 te salud, Don Corleone.
2244042 2249297 I said that I would see you, because<br />I heard you were a serious man,
2249381 2251633 to be treated with respect.
2256304 2259599 But, I must say no to you.
2260767 2263603 And I'll give you my reason.
2263687 2266523 It's true,<br />I have a lot of friends in politics.
2267774 2272195 They wouldn't be friendly long if I was<br />involved in drugs instead of gambling,
2272278 2277909 which they regard as a harmless vice,<br />but drugs is a dirty business.
2277993 2282998 It doesn't make any difference to me<br />what a man does for a living.
2283081 2288336 But your business is… a little dangerous.
2288420 2292841 If you're worried about security,<br />the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
2292924 2296428 - The Tattaglias would guarantee our…<br />- Wait a minute.
2303727 2308523 I have a sentimental weakness<br />for my children, and I spoil them.
2308606 2311860 They talk when they should listen.<br />But anyway…
2311985 2317365 Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to<br />congratulate you on your new business.
2317449 2320910 I know you'll do well, and good luck.
2320994 2325832 Especially since your interests<br />don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
2346478 2348396 Santino.
2348480 2350315 Come here.
2352650 2354569 What's the matter with you?
2354652 2359282 Your brain is going soft<br />from playing with that girl.
2359365 2363495 Never tell anybody outside the family<br />what you're thinking again.
2364788 2366039 Go on.
2370001 2372837 Tom, what's this nonsense?
2372921 2376341 It's from Johnny.<br />He's starring in that new film.
2378676 2381262 - Take it away.<br />- Take it over there.
2382555 2384099 And
2385141 2387310 tell Luca Brasi to come in.
2393441 2396861 I'm a little worried<br />about this Sollozzo fellow.
2396945 2399906 Find out what he's got<br />under his fingernails.
2400907 2404536 Go to the Tattaglias.
2404619 2408915 Make them think that you're not<br />too happy with our family
2410291 2412669 and find out what you can.
2430145 2433439 I got something for your mother<br />and for Sonny
2433523 2438194 and a tie for Freddy,<br />and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.
2438278 2441531 - What do you want for Christmas?<br />- Just you.
2473438 2475356 <i>Andiamo, Fredo.</i>
2475440 2478860 - Tell Paulie to get the car.<br />- Okay, Pop.
2478943 2482947 I'll have to get it myself.<br />Paulie called in sick this morning.
2484699 2487952 Paulie's a good kid.<br />I don't mind getting the car.
2491372 2493541 <i>Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.</i>
2536167 2540463 - Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.<br />- I know.
2550390 2551391 You know who I am?
2551474 2552809 I know you.
2554102 2557689 You have been talking to the<br />Tattaglia family… right?
2558690 2562694 I think you and I can do business.
2564529 2567198 I need someone strong like you.
2567824 2570660 I heard you are not happy…
2571077 2573371 …with the Corleone family.
2574122 2575873 Want to join me?
2577041 2579002 What's in it for me?
2581629 2584549 $50,000 to start with.
2586551 2587802 Not bad!
2589470 2591097 Agreed?
2650531 2654243 Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
2654369 2659290 - Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.<br />- I haven't got time.
2659374 2662418 Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.
2664253 2668758 What are you worried about? If I wanted<br />to kill you, you'd be dead already.
2668841 2670301 Get in.
2681312 2685024 - Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.<br />- Okay, Pop.
2691823 2694659 Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.
2782205 2786250 Would you like me better<br />if I were a nun? Like in the story.
2789378 2790379 No.
2790463 2794842 - What if I were Ingrid Bergman?<br />- Now, that's a thought.
2797428 2799388 Michael.
2799472 2801891 No, I wouldn't like you better<br />if you were Ingrid Bergman.
2801974 2803768 What's the matter?
2820660 2823329 They don't say if he's dead or alive.
2845601 2848896 <i>- Sonny, it's Michael.<br />- Where have you been?</i>
2848980 2851732 <i>- Is he all right?<br />- We don't know yet.</i>
2851816 2855861 <i>There are all kinds of stories.<br />He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>
2857822 2861075 <i>- Are you there?<br />- Yeah, I'm here.</i>
2861200 2866080 <i>- Where have you been? I was worried.<br />- Didn't Tom tell you I called?</i>
2866163 2870209 <i>No. Look, come home, kid.<br />You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>
2877675 2879260 Oh, my God.
2883264 2884682 Sonny!
2893566 2895860 Stay back there.
2895943 2898613 - Who is it?<br />- Open up, it's Clemenza.
2901032 2904285 There's more news about your old man.
2904368 2906537 Word is out that he's already dead.
2906954 2910875 - What's the matter with you?<br />- Take it easy!
2911042 2914295 - Where was Paulie?<br />- Sick. He's been sick all winter.
2914378 2916797 - How often?<br />- Only three, four times.
2916881 2920676 - Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.<br />- Pick him up now.
2920760 2925598 I don't care how sick he is. Bring him<br />to my father's house right now.
2925681 2928768 - You want anyone sent over here?<br />- No. Go ahead.
2937943 2941947 I'm going to have a couple of our people<br />come over to the house.
2944867 2947036 <i>- Hello?<br />- Santino Corleone?</i>
2947119 2949955 <i>- Yeah.<br />- We have Tom Hagen.</i>
2950039 2953751 <i>In three hours he'll be released<br />with our proposition.</i>
2953834 2957171 <i>Listen to what he has to say<br />before you do anything.</i>
2957254 2961884 <i>What's done is done. Don't lose that<br />famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>
2961967 2963678 I'll wait.
2978025 2980027 Your boss is dead.
2982863 2987284 I know you're not in the muscle end<br />of the family, so don't be scared.
2988369 2992248 I want you to help the Corleones<br />and me.
2996210 3000715 We got him outside his office<br />about an hour after we picked you up.
3002133 3003426 Drink it.
3008180 3011642 It's up to you to make peace<br />between me and Sonny.
3015855 3018649 Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?
3020025 3022862 And you knew<br />it was the right thing to do.
3024029 3029160 - Sonny will come after you.<br />- That will be his first reaction, sure.
3030578 3037084 So you have to talk sense into him.<br />The Tattaglia family is behind me.
3037168 3042256 The other New York families will go<br />along with anything to prevent war.
3042339 3047553 Let's face it, with all due respect,<br />the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.
3050556 3053559 Ten years ago,<br />could I have gotten to him?
3057438 3061400 Well, now he's dead, Tom,<br />and nothing can bring him back.
3063194 3069074 You've got to talk to Sonny, to the<br />Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.
3074038 3076123 It's good business, Tom.
3077500 3082338 I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able<br />to call off Luca Brasi.
3085382 3087176 Yeah, well…
3089011 3091388 Let me worry about Luca.
3096602 3098979 You just talk to Sonny.
3099063 3101315 And the other two kids.
3104276 3106779 - I'll do my best.<br />- Good.
3109156 3111575 Now you can go.
3118415 3123087 I don't like violence, Tom.<br />I'm a businessman.
3123170 3125631 Blood is a big expense.
3146861 3148737 He's still alive.
3148821 3152783 They hit him with five shots,<br />and he's still alive!
3152867 3157621 That's bad luck for me, and bad luck<br />for you if you don't make that deal.
3202333 3207171 Your mother is at the hospital with<br />your father. Looks like he'll pull through.
3209006 3215638 It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip<br />Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon…
3215721 3219141 - You gonna kill all those guys?<br />- Stay out of it.
3219224 3221685 If you get rid of Sollozzo,<br />everything falls into line.
3221769 3226065 What about Luca?<br />Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
3226148 3229944 If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.
3230027 3233614 - Has anyone been in touch with Luca?<br />- We've been trying all night.
3233697 3237743 - Hey, do me a favor…<br />- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
3239828 3245042 Well, Tom, you're consigliere.<br />What do we do if the old man dies?
3246168 3252383 If we lose the old man, we lose the<br />political contacts and half our strength.
3252466 3258138 The other New York families might<br />support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
3258222 3262768 This is almost 1 946.<br />Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
3262851 3264520 If your father dies
3266939 3268691 you make the deal.
3268774 3273654 - Easy to say. He's not your father.<br />- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.
3278242 3279743 What is it?
3280744 3286542 - Paulie, I told you to stay put.<br />- The guy at the gates has a package.
3286625 3288752 Tessio, go see what it is.
3292089 3294341 - Shall I stay?<br />- Yeah. Are you all right?
3294425 3298178 - I'm fine.<br />- There's food. Are you hungry?
3298262 3301849 - No.<br />- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.
3301932 3304560 - Go ahead.<br />- That might be a good idea.
3306311 3312359 Take care of that son -of-a -bitch.<br />Paulie sold out the old man.
3312443 3316030 - Make that the first thing on your list.<br />- Understood.
3316113 3320409 Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys<br />and go to Luca's apartment.
3320492 3324204 Maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br />mixed up in this too directly.
3326749 3330461 Hanging around the house<br />on the phone would be a big help.
3331336 3333255 Try Luca again.
3342181 3344933 - What's this?<br />- A Sicilian message.
3345017 3347895 It means Luca Brasi<br />sleeps with the fishes.
3361617 3363702 - I'm going.<br />- When will you be home?
3363786 3365454 Probably late.
3367998 3371668 - Don't forget the cannoli!<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3373921 3378425 Rocco, sit on the other side.<br />You block the rear -view mirror.
3379968 3383388 Sonny's running wild. He wants<br />to go to mattresses already.
3383472 3389353 We have to find a spot on the<br />West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.
3389436 3392940 - Know a good spot on the West Side?<br />- I'll think about it.
3393023 3396777 Think while you're driving.<br />I want to hit New York this month.
3396860 3398612 Watch the kids.
3409498 3415295 Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up<br />18 mattresses and bring me the bill.
3415379 3416797 Yeah, all right.
3416880 3421301 Make sure they're clean, because<br />the guys will be there a long time.
3421385 3425639 - They're clean and exterminated.<br />- That's a bad word to use.
3425722 3429685 Exterminate! Watch out,<br />so we don't exterminate you!
3436400 3438902 Pull over. I've got to take a leak.
3480777 3483989 Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
3502174 3505052 Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!
3506970 3509097 - Yeah.<br />- Phone call!
3515145 3517356 - Who is it?<br />- Some girl.
3521652 3524071 <i>- Hello. Kay?<br />- How's your father?</i>
3524154 3526156 He's going to make it.
3526615 3528450 <i>I love you.</i>
3529868 3531495 I>I love you!
3532329 3534957 <i>- Michael?<br />- Yeah, I know.</i>
3535040 3537960 <i>- Tell me you love me.<br />- I can't talk.</i>
3538043 3539920 <i>Can't you say it?</i>
3541129 3543006 I'll see you tonight.
3543799 3546927 Why don't you tell that nice girl<br />you love her?
3547010 3551807 I love you with all my heart. If I don't<br />see you again soon, I'm going to die!
3552891 3557771 Come and learn something. You might<br />have to cook for 20 guys some day.
3557854 3561483 You start with a little oil,<br />then fry some garlic.
3561608 3567239 Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,<br />fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.
3567322 3571410 You get it to a boil, you shove in<br />all your sausage and meatballs.
3573287 3575372 Add a little bit of wine.
3578625 3583046 And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.
3583171 3587426 Cut the crap. I have more important<br />things for you. How's Paulie?
3587509 3589720 You won't see him no more.
3591179 3593682 - Where are you going?<br />- To the city.
3593765 3597269 - Send bodyguards with him.<br />- I'm going to the hospital…
3597352 3600689 He'll be all right.<br />Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.
3600772 3602774 - Be careful.<br />- Yes, sir.
3605902 3608196 Send somebody with him anyway.
3636266 3639311 - I have to go.<br />- Can I go with you?
3641104 3645442 No, Kay. There will be detectives there,<br />people from the press.
3645525 3647652 I'll wait in the cab.
3650280 3652908 I don't want you to get involved.
3655619 3657871 When will I see you again?
3664211 3668340 Go back to New Hampshire,<br />and I'll call you at your parents' house.
3670092 3674805 - When will I see you again, Michael?<br />- I don't know.
3807020 3810857 What are you doing here?<br />You're not supposed to be here.
3810941 3814444 I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.
3814528 3816863 What happened to the guards?
3816947 3822369 Your father had too many visitors.<br />They interfered with hospital service.
3822452 3825789 The police made them leave<br />about 10 minutes ago.
3830293 3834256 Get me Long Beach 45620, please.
3836800 3839135 Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
3843181 3848019 Sonny, I'm at the hospital.<br />I got here late, there's nobody here.
3848144 3852399 No Tessio's men,<br />no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.
3852482 3854985 <i>- Don't panic.<br />- I won't panic.</i>
3856444 3859322 I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.
3862033 3864869 We're going to move him<br />to another room.
3864953 3867956 Can you disconnect the tubes?
3868039 3871585 - That's out of the question!<br />- Do you know my father?
3871668 3875964 Men are coming here to kill him.<br />Do you understand?
3876047 3877841 Help me, please.
3954918 3958713 - Who are you?<br />- I am Enzo, the baker.
3959756 3961800 - Remember me?<br />- Enzo.
3961883 3965011 You'd better go,<br />there's going to be trouble.
3965095 3969724 If there is trouble, I'll stay here<br />to help you. For your father.
3971726 3975855 Listen. Wait for me outside,<br />in front of the hospital, all right?
3975939 3978024 I'll be out in a minute.
3991788 3995542 Just lie here, Pop.<br />I'll take care of you now.
3997502 3999546 I'm with you now.
4001172 4002716 I'm with you.
4038168 4040336 Get rid of these. Come here.
4041296 4045717 Put your hand in your pocket,<br />like you have a gun. You'll be all right.
4097060 4098728 You did good.
4147277 4150488 I thought all you Guinea hoods<br />were locked up!
4150613 4155201 - Why isn't anyone guarding my father?<br />- You little punk!
4155285 4159205 Don't you tell me my business!<br />I pulled them off.
4159330 4165253 - Stay away from this hospital!<br />- Not until my father's room is guarded.
4166087 4169382 - Phil, take him in!<br />- The kid's clean, Captain.
4169465 4173303 - He's a war hero. He's never been…<br />- I said take him in!
4175471 4181728 - What's The Turk paying you?<br />- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.
4181811 4183688 Stand him up straight.
4205835 4211466 I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men<br />are hired to protect Vito Corleone.
4211549 4213968 They're licensed to carry firearms.
4214052 4218473 If you interfere, you'll have to appear<br />before the judge and show cause.
4218556 4220558 Let him go.
4252966 4256886 - What's with all the new faces?<br />- We'll need them now.
4256970 4259847 After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.
4259931 4263101 We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.
4264227 4266229 Jesus Christ.
4272902 4275405 Looks like a fortress around here.
4277532 4282912 Tamaduch! Hey… 100 buttonmen<br />on the street 24 hours a day.
4282996 4286582 That Turk shows one hair on his ass,<br />he's dead.
4288626 4290712 Mike, let me look at you.
4294757 4297802 You're beautiful, beautiful.<br />You're gorgeous.
4297927 4303516 The Turk wants to talk!<br />Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.
4303599 4306352 - He wants a meeting today.<br />- What did he say?
4306477 4311274 What did he say… He wants us to send<br />Michael to hear the proposition.
4311357 4314819 He promises that the deal<br />is too good to refuse.
4314902 4317989 - And Bruno Tattaglia?<br />- That's part of the deal.
4318072 4322368 - He cancels out what they did to Father.<br />- We should listen to them.
4322452 4325580 No more! Not this time, Consigliere.
4325663 4329208 No more meetings, discussions,<br />or Sollozzo tricks.
4329292 4332336 I want Sollozzo, or we go to war…
4332420 4335381 - The other families…<br />- They hand me Sollozzo!
4335465 4337759 This is business, not personal!
4337842 4342263 - They shot my father…<br />- Even that was business, not personal.
4343181 4346934 Then business will have to suffer.<br />Do me a favor.
4347018 4351022 No more advice on how<br />to patch things up. Just help me win.
4357320 4361240 I found out about Captain McCluskey,<br />who broke Mike's jaw.
4361324 4365620 He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,<br />and for big money.
4365703 4369749 McCluskey has agreed<br />to be The Turk's bodyguard.
4369832 4373586 So when Sollozzo is being guarded,<br />he's invulnerable.
4373669 4377256 Nobody has ever gunned down<br />a New York police captain.
4377381 4383304 All the families would come after you.<br />The Corleone family would be outcasts!
4383387 4387225 Even the old man's political protection<br />would run for cover.
4388518 4392355 Do me a favor.<br />Take this into consideration.
4396192 4398194 All right, we'll wait.
4403616 4406452 We can't wait. We can't wait.
4407912 4411874 No matter what Sollozzo says,<br />he's going to kill Pop.
4411958 4415670 That's the key for him.<br />We've got to get Sollozzo.
4415753 4420049 - Mike is right.<br />- Let me ask you something.
4420133 4424720 What about this McCluskey?<br />What do we do with this cop?
4429892 4432770 They want to have a meeting<br />with me, right?
4433646 4438067 It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.
4440069 4442071 Let's set the meeting.
4444240 4447952 Get our informers to find out<br />where it's going to be held.
4449787 4453583 We insist it's a public place.<br />A bar, a restaurant.
4453666 4457420 Some place where there are people,<br />so I feel safe.
4460173 4463176 They'll search me<br />when I meet them, right?
4463259 4465595 So I can't have a weapon on me.
4468973 4473936 But if Clemenza can figure out a way to<br />have a weapon planted there for me
4478900 4481110 then I'll kill them both.
4493206 4497919 Nice college boy. Didn't want to<br />get mixed up in the family business.
4498044 4501672 Now you want to shoot a police captain<br />because he slapped you?
4501797 4508304 This isn't like the army! You have to get<br />close and get their brains on your suit.
4508387 4511432 You're taking this very personal.
4511515 4514936 Tom, this is business<br />and he's taking it personal.
4515061 4518522 - Where does it say you can't kill a cop?<br />- Mikey…
4518648 4524737 I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up<br />in drugs, a dishonest cop.
4525780 4530076 A cop who got mixed up in the rackets<br />and got what was coming.
4530201 4534747 That's a terrific story. We have<br />newspaper people on the payroll, right?
4536207 4540044 - They might like a story like that.<br />- They might.
4543714 4547301 It's not personal, Sonny.<br />It's strictly business.
4550513 4552056 It's as cold as they come.
4552139 4555393 Impossible to trace,<br />so you don't worry about prints.
4555810 4559855 I put a special tape on the trigger<br />and the butt. Try it.
4572034 4574120 Is the trigger too tight?
4577456 4578666 My ears!
4578749 4583379 I left it noisy, so it scares away any<br />pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.
4584547 4587466 You've shot them both.<br />Now what do you do?
4589844 4593514 - Sit down, finish my dinner.<br />- Don't fool around.
4593597 4597143 Let your hand drop to your side<br />and let the gun slip out.
4597226 4601647 Everybody will still think you've got it.<br />They'll stare at your face,
4601731 4604608 so walk out fast, but don't run.
4604692 4608112 Don't look anybody in the eye,<br />but don't look away either.
4608195 4611699 They'll be scared stiff,<br />so don't worry about nothing.
4613743 4617997 You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,<br />nobody knows where,
4618080 4620166 and we'll catch the hell.
4620791 4624628 - How bad do you think it will be?<br />- Pretty goddamn bad.
4624712 4627757 All the other families will probably<br />line up against us.
4627882 4633429 These things have to happen every five,<br />10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.
4633554 4637975 Been 10 years since the last one.<br />You have to stop them at the beginning.
4638100 4643814 Like they should have stopped Hitler in<br />Munich, not letting him get away with it.
4645232 4649737 You know, Mike, we were all proud<br />of you. Being a hero and all.
4649820 4651530 Your father too.
4689610 4693030 Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
4693989 4698244 Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br />where the meeting will be held.
4698327 4700663 How much time do we have?
4701539 4706335 They're going to pick you up outside<br />Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
4707336 4712216 - We could put a tail on them.<br />- Sollozzo would lose our ass.
4713592 4718139 - What about the negotiator?<br />- He's playing pinochle with my men.
4718264 4723352 - He's happy. They're letting him win.<br />- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
4723436 4726814 The negotiator plays cards<br />until Mike is back safe.
4726897 4730943 - He could blast whoever is in the car.<br />- They'll expect that.
4731026 4734363 Sollozzo might not even be<br />in the car, Sonny!
4734447 4735948 I'll get it.
4761223 4763392 Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
4763476 4766812 - Is it reliable?<br />- My man in McCluskey's precinct.
4766937 4772651 A police captain is on call 24 hours<br />a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.
4772735 4777615 - Anybody know this joint?<br />- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.
4777698 4782661 A small family place, good food.<br />Everyone minds his business. Perfect.
4783412 4788584 They've got an old -fashioned toilet.<br />You know, the box and the chain thing.
4790586 4793672 We might be able to<br />tape the gun behind it.
4793756 4797885 All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,
4797968 4801847 you eat, talk for a while, you relax.<br />Make them relax.
4801931 4807269 Then you go to take a leak. No,<br />better still, you ask permission to go.
4807353 4811815 Then you come back blasting.<br />Two shots in the head apiece.
4813567 4816070 I want somebody very good<br />to plant that gun.
4816153 4819657 I don't want him coming out<br />with just his dick.
4819740 4825287 - The gun will be there.<br />- You drive him and pick him up.
4825371 4827039 Let's move.
4832545 4835714 Did he tell you to drop the gun<br />right away?
4835798 4837675 Yeah, a million times.
4842429 4846642 Don't forget. Two shots apiece<br />in the head as soon as you come out.
4853232 4856819 How long do you think it will be<br />before I can come back?
4857653 4859738 At least a year.
4859863 4864660 I'll square it with Mom, that you're not<br />seeing her before you leave and…
4866203 4870040 I'll get a message to that girlfriend<br />when the time is right.
4875879 4877381 Take care.
4880175 4881927 Take care, Mike.
4914752 4918547 I'm glad you came. I hope<br />we can straighten everything out.
4919757 4924845 It's not the way I wanted things to go.<br />It should never have happened.
4924970 4929266 I want to straighten everything out.<br />Don't want my father bothered again.
4929350 4932603 I swear on my children<br />that he won't be, Mike.
4933604 4936899 But you have to keep an open mind<br />when we talk.
4936982 4941403 I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.<br />You can't talk business with him.
4943280 4944948 He's a good kid.
4949036 4952414 I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.
4952498 4956585 I've got to frisk you, so turn around.<br />On your knees, facing me.
4961715 4966387 I guess I'm getting too old for my job.<br />Too grouchy.
4967805 4971642 Can't stand the aggravation.<br />You know how it is.
4973936 4975354 He's clean.
5001964 5004258 Going to Jersey?
5006760 5008303 Maybe.
5033579 5035372 Nice work, Lou.
5072534 5078081 - How's the food in this restaurant?<br />- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.
5078165 5079833 I'll have it.
5115410 5118580 - I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.<br />- Go ahead.
5124804 5126804 I am sorry.<br />Forget about it.
5130710 5132110 You - got to know
5132734 5136234 The hit on your father<br />was a matter of business.
5138058 5140558 Look - I have much respect for your father.
5141182 5144282 But - your father's thinkink is outdated.
5146306 5150506 And you have to understand...I<br />am a man of honor.
5150930 5153930 I under...stand
5154954 5155954 very clearly...
5155978 5157578 I am glad
5169602 5175202 And you need to be clear...why<br />I work with the Tattaglia family...
5177026 5180026 because once I make a deal...
5181850 5183950 I want peace.
5183974 5186774 Let's stop all this nonsense.
5187098 5188898 I want to...um...
5191322 5192322 What?
5194046 5196046 How to say this?
5198201 5199870 What I want…
5200829 5202998 What's most important to me
5205751 5209963 is that I have a guarantee.<br />No more attempts on my father's life.
5210047 5214801 What guarantees can I give you?<br />I'm the hunted one!
5214885 5218430 I missed my chance.<br />You think too much of me, kid.
5218513 5220349 I'm not that clever.
5221850 5224102 All I want is a truce.
5230651 5234488 I have to go to the bathroom.<br />Is it all right?
5235864 5238367 When you got to go, you got to go.
5243872 5245791 He's clean.
5245874 5247960 Don't take too long.
5251088 5252881 I've frisked a thousand punks.
5328905 5330305 You ok?
5332529 5334529 Okay, I want you to<br />understand something...
5334553 5336653 You're Italian, just like your father.
5338977 5340977 Your father, is in bad shape.
5343001 5346301 Surely you can see...that he will<br />need your help when he is better again.
5347025 5349025 This fight has to end!
5350749 5353449 You need to help me...<br />so we can end this.
5543505 5545507 Okay, you take over.
5562774 5564609 I love you, Grandpa.
5567529 5570240 I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.
5571574 5574661 - Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.<br />- Okay.
5574786 5581042 "I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish<br />I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."
5584045 5586339 Go with your mother.
5586423 5588550 Take them downstairs.
5594681 5596725 Go on, Carlo, you too.
5598435 5600145 Go on.
5620749 5624753 - What's the matter with you, Carlo?<br />- Shut up and set the table.
5640310 5646358 Since McCluskey's killing, the police<br />have cracked down on our operations.
5648109 5652989 And also the other families.<br />There's been a lot of bad blood.
5653073 5656576 They hit us, so we hit them back.
5657410 5661956 Through our newspaper contacts<br />we've been able to put out material
5662040 5666336 about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo<br />in the drug rackets.
5666419 5668546 So things are loosening up.
5669798 5674552 And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,
5674636 5677180 under the protection<br />of Don Francesco of L.A.
5677305 5681810 - I want him to rest.<br />- I'm going to learn the casino business.
5690151 5691945 Where's Michael?
5704249 5707377 It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
5709170 5713007 But he's safe. We're starting to work<br />to bring him back.
5734404 5736841 I want you to find out<br />where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
5736865 5738825 I want him now.
5742537 5747250 If you go after Tattaglia, all hell<br />will break loose. Pop can negotiate.
5747333 5753339 - He must get better first. I'll decide…<br />- War is costly. We can't do business.
5753423 5757260 - Neither can they. Don't worry about it!<br />- We can't afford a stalemate.
5757385 5762307 - No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!<br />- You're getting a great reputation!
5762432 5768480 Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime<br />consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!
5768563 5770857 Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
5774444 5776738 I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
5777906 5780867 Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.
5781784 5786164 Niggers are having a good time<br />with our policy banks in Harlem.
5786247 5790418 Driving new Cadillacs,<br />paying 50% on a bet.
5790502 5793838 That's because<br />they've started making big money.
5793922 5797217 Papa never talked business<br />at the table.
5797300 5801179 - Shut up, Connie…<br />- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.
5801930 5803014 Don't interfere.
5805308 5809229 I 'd like to talk to you after dinner.<br />I could do more for the family…
5809312 5812106 We don't discuss business at the table.
5859320 5861948 I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
5867495 5869497 Why are you so far<br />from the house?
5870164 5872834 You know I'm responsible to your<br />father for your life.
5872917 5874210 The bodyguards are here.
5875128 5876462 It's still dangerous…
5877589 5879340 We've heard from Santino<br />in New York…
5880758 5883011 Your enemies know you're here.
5885013 5886764 Did Santino say when<br />I can go back?
5887432 5888725 Not yet.
5889392 5891227 It's out of the question.
5894689 5896107 Where are you going now?
5897775 5898818 To Corleone.
5899444 5900695 Take my car.
5904032 5905074 I want to walk.
5907702 5908870 Be careful.
5943404 5944781 Where have all the men gone?
5945823 5948034 They're all dead from vendettas.
5949661 5952080 There are the names of the dead.
5968471 5972600 Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!
5972684 5976979 Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!<br />Clark Gable!
5977105 5982360 America! Take me to the America, G. I.!<br />Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!
6000294 6002338 Mamma mia what a beauty.
6010513 6013599 I think you got hit<br />by the thunderbolt.
6019814 6023818 In Sicily women are more<br />dangerous than shotguns.
6046507 6048676 Did you have a good hunt?
6049635 6052013 You know all the girls<br />around here?
6052513 6054015 We saw some real beauties.
6054849 6058352 One of them struck our friend<br />like a thunderbolt.
6061564 6064317 She would tempt the devil himself.
6071949 6074118 Really put together.
6074202 6075244 Right, Calo?
6078998 6081000 Such hair, such mouth!
6083377 6086547 The girls around here are<br />beautiful… but virtuous.
6087089 6089467 This one had a purple dress…
6089842 6091969 And a purple ribbon in her hair.
6098434 6100269 Do you know her?
6104690 6107485 There's no girl like that<br />in this town.
6110196 6111405 My God, I understand!
6115535 6116536 What's wrong?
6118746 6120122 Let's go.
6122083 6123334 It's his daughter.
6123793 6125294 Tell him to come here.
6128714 6130049 Call him.
6150111 6152446 Fabrizio, you translate.
6156576 6158452 I apologize if I offended you.
6159453 6162874 I'm a stranger in this country.
6162957 6166043 I meant no disrespect<br />to you or your daughter.
6171507 6174385 I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.
6175803 6178139 My name is Michael Corleone.
6180182 6184312 There are people who'd pay<br />a lot of money for that information.
6186480 6189525 But then your daughter<br />would lose a father
6191110 6193487 instead of gaining a husband.
6201662 6203873 I want to meet your daughter.
6204540 6209128 With your permission, and under<br />the supervision of your family.
6209795 6211464 With all respect.
6217511 6221515 Come to my house Sunday morning.<br />My name is Vitelli.
6227021 6228522 What's her name?
6403864 6406033 I'll knock you dizzy.
6411789 6413874 Save it for the library.
6417545 6420214 We've got to pick up my sister.
6438274 6439984 What's the matter?
6442444 6444238 What's the matter?
6446031 6447950 - It was my fault!<br />- Where is he?
6448033 6451203 It was my fault. I hit him.
6451287 6455082 I started a fight with him.<br />I hit him, so he hit me…
6460296 6463591 I'm just going to get a doctor<br />to take a look at you.
6463674 6466177 Sonny, please don't do anything.
6468137 6470222 What's the matter with you?<br />What am I going to do?
6470306 6473184 Make that baby an orphan<br />before he's born?
6477730 6480941 You spic slobs still betting Yankees?
6481025 6483694 Tell them to stop taking in action.
6484528 6486238 We lost enough money last week.
6493370 6495414 Come here, come here!
6552346 6555683 If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.
6788916 6793170 Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.<br />You should call.
6793253 6797591 Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.
6797674 6801512 - I want to reach Michael.<br />- Nobody knows where he is.
6801595 6804139 All we know is that he's all right.
6806683 6810312 - What was that?<br />- An accident, but nobody was hurt.
6811438 6815567 Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.<br />Please?
6817110 6822282 If I accepted that, a court could prove<br />I have knowledge of his whereabouts.
6823283 6825160 He'll get in touch with you.
6825285 6828956 I let my cab go,<br />so can I call another one, please?
6829039 6830916 Come on. Sorry.
6848141 6852813 <i>- Hello?<br />- Is Carlo there?</i>
6853605 6856066 <i>- Who is this?<br />- A friend of Carlo.</i>
6856149 6859528 <i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight<br />until later.</i>
6865284 6866535 Bitch!
6868537 6871331 - Dinner's on the table.<br />- I'm not hungry.
6871415 6874751 - The food is getting cold.<br />- I'll eat out later.
6874835 6878213 <i>- You just told me to make you dinner!<br />- Vafangool!</i>
6878422 6880549 I'll vafangoolyou!
6885387 6888181 She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.
6892519 6896857 That's it, break it all,<br />you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!
6906074 6909202 Why don't you bring<br />your whore home for dinner?
6910203 6911872 Maybe I will.
6918629 6921798 - Clean it up!<br />- Like hell I will!
6921882 6925802 You skinny, spoiled brat.<br />Clean it up! Clean it up!
6925886 6930390 Clean it up! I said, clean it up!<br />Clean it up!
6930474 6935312 Clean it up. Clean that up, you…
6938565 6940275 Clean it!
6940359 6944613 Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.<br />Be a murderer, like your father!
6944696 6948158 - All you Corleones are murderers!<br />- I hate you!
6948241 6949951 Come on, kill me!
6951495 6953163 Get out of here!
6953246 6956667 - I hate you!<br />- Now I'll kill you.
6956750 6959419 You Guinea brat. Get out of here!
6969888 6972849 Connie, what's the matter?<br />I can't hear you.
6973975 6977020 Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.
6977104 6980023 Santino, I can't understand.<br />I don't know.
6981316 6983110 Yeah, Connie.
6987781 6989741 You wait there.
6992369 6994913 No, you just wait there.
6997082 6999334 Son -of-a -bitch.
6999418 7002629 - Son -of-a -bitch!<br />- What's the matter?
7006800 7009886 Open the goddamn gate!<br />Get off your ass.
7017894 7019146 Sonny!
7025610 7027612 - Sonny.<br />- Get out of here!
7028697 7030574 Go after him, go on!
7060312 7062355 Son -of-a -bitch. Come on!
7171047 7172883 Give me a drop.
7181308 7183602 My wife is crying upstairs.
7185979 7188481 I hear cars coming to the house.
7193153 7196072 <i>Consigliere of mine,</i>
7196156 7199659 tell your Don<br />what everyone seems to know.
7199743 7202120 I didn't tell Mama anything.
7203079 7206333 I was about to come up and wake you<br />and tell you.
7209836 7212047 But you needed a drink first.
7214382 7215634 Yeah.
7218929 7221431 Well, now you've had your drink.
7226978 7230857 They shot Sonny on the causeway.<br />He's dead.
7247916 7250460 I want no inquiries made.
7254923 7257467 I want no acts of vengeance.
7259177 7262013 I want you to arrange a meeting
7263014 7265642 with the heads of the five families.
7267560 7269646 This war stops now.
7291584 7294129 Call Bonasera.
7294212 7296381 I need him now.
7308768 7313940 This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling<br />for Vito Corleone, at his request.
7314024 7316401 You owe your Don a service.
7316484 7320030 <i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>
7320113 7324451 <i>He will be at your funeral parlor<br />in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>
7345638 7350435 Well, my friend, are you ready<br />to do me this service?
7350518 7353605 Yes. What do you want me to do?
7370622 7373541 I don't want his mother<br />to see him this way.
7389557 7392685 Look how they massacred my boy.
7421714 7424968 It's safer to teach you English!
7425718 7427137 I know English…
7427220 7432016 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,<br />Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.
7439232 7441025 Greetings, Don Tommasino.
7441734 7443736 How are things in Palermo?
7449742 7453788 Michael is teaching me to<br />drive… watch, I'll show you.
7456583 7458418 How are things in Palermo?
7458793 7461921 Young people don't respect<br />anything anymore…
7463006 7466384 times are changing for the worse.
7468636 7472056 This place has become<br />too dangerous for you.
7474767 7479939 I want you to move to a villa<br />near Siracusa… right now.
7485945 7487113 What's wrong?
7488239 7490450 Bad news from America.
7492911 7496623 Your brother, Santino,<br />they killed him.
7503213 7505048 Let's go… you promised.
7523858 7524859 Fabrizio!
7524943 7526361 Get the car.
7527737 7531908 Are you driving yourself, Boss?<br />Is your wife coming with you?
7531991 7535578 No, take her to her father's house<br />until things are safe.
7535662 7537580 Okay, anything you say.
7543503 7545255 Calo, where is Apollonia?
7546005 7549509 She's going to surprise you.<br />She wants to drive.
7551803 7553846 She'll make a good American wife.
7555306 7557850 Wait, I'll get the baggage.
7568111 7570280 Fabrizio!
7570363 7572031 Where are you going?
7573741 7576160 Wait there! I'll drive to you.
7582292 7583710 No, Apollonia!
7606774 7612613 Don Barzini, I want to thank you<br />for helping me organize this meeting,
7612739 7617577 and the other heads of the five families<br />from New York and New Jersey.
7619329 7622457 Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,
7622540 7625877 and from Brooklyn
7627503 7629589 Philip Tattaglia.
7631382 7634093 And from Staten Island
7634177 7637680 we have with us Victor Strachi.
7637764 7643394 And the other associates that came as<br />far as from California and Kansas City
7643478 7647231 and all the other territories<br />of the country. Thank you.
7654072 7657533 How did things ever get so far?
7657617 7659243 I don't know.
7661287 7664791 It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.
7667919 7671339 Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.
7673800 7677220 We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,
7677303 7681307 then I'm willing to let things go on<br />as before.
7682767 7686396 We're grateful to Don Corleone<br />for calling this meeting.
7686479 7691859 We all know him as a man of his word.<br />A modest man who listens to reason.
7691943 7696030 Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.
7696114 7700326 He had all the judges and politicians<br />in his pocket.
7700410 7703287 He refused to share them.
7703371 7707166 When did I ever refuse<br />an accommodation?
7707250 7709627 All of you know me.
7710545 7715716 When did I ever refuse,<br />except one time? And why?
7717385 7723224 Because I believe this drug business<br />will destroy us in the years to come.
7723307 7727562 It's not like gambling or liquor<br />or even women,
7727645 7733609 which is something that most people<br />want, but is forbidden by the Church.
7733734 7738448 Even the police that have helped us in<br />the past with gambling and other things
7738531 7742743 are going to refuse to help us<br />when it comes to narcotics.
7742827 7747957 I believed that then<br />and I believe that now.
7748040 7750251 Times have changed.
7750376 7755089 It's not like the old days,<br />when we could do anything we wanted.
7755173 7758050 A refusal is not the act of a friend.
7758134 7763556 If Don Corleone had all the judges and<br />politicians, then he must share them
7763639 7768227 or let others use them. He must let us<br />draw the water from the well.
7769312 7772899 Certainly he can present a bill<br />for such services.
7772982 7775568 After all, we're not communists.
7778696 7781782 I also don't believe in drugs.
7781908 7786746 For years I paid my people extra, so<br />they wouldn't do that kind of business.
7786829 7789957 Somebody says to them<br />" I have powders."
7790041 7793294 "If you put up<br />3 -4,000 dollar investment,
7793586 7796380 we can make 50,000 distributing."
7797590 7803513 They can't resist. I want to control it<br />as a business, keep it respectable.
7803596 7808392 I don't want it near schools,<br />I don't want it sold to children.
7808476 7810269 <i>That's an infàmia.</i>
7811604 7815525 In my city we would keep the traffic<br />to the colored.
7815608 7818819 They're animals,<br />so let them lose their souls.
7825451 7829038 I hoped that we could come here<br />and reason together.
7830456 7837088 And I'm willing to do whatever is<br />necessary to find a peaceful solution.
7837630 7842218 We are agreed. The traffic in drugs<br />will be permitted, but controlled.
7842301 7846597 Don Corleone will give us protection<br />in the east, and there will be peace.
7846681 7850434 I must have strict assurance<br />from Corleone.
7850518 7853813 As time goes by<br />and his position becomes stronger,
7853896 7856566 will he attempt any individual vendetta?
7856649 7861779 We are all reasonable men.<br />We don't have to give assurances.
7861862 7864740 You talk about vengeance.
7864824 7868077 Will vengeance<br />bring your son back to you?
7868160 7870705 Or my boy to me?
7870788 7873583 I forgo the vengeance of my son.
7876377 7878671 But I have selfish reasons.
7880965 7884552 My youngest son was forced<br />to leave this country
7886429 7888973 because of this Sollozzo business.
7890516 7894437 And I have to make arrangements<br />to bring him back here safely.
7894520 7897189 Cleared of all these false charges.
7898608 7901736 But I'm a superstitious man.
7901861 7907158 If an unlucky accident should befall him,<br />if he should be shot by a police officer,
7908534 7912121 or if he should hang himself<br />in his jail cell,
7912204 7915082 or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,
7916375 7919962 then I'm going to blame<br />some of the people in this room.
7921631 7923966 And that I do not forgive.
7926427 7928804 But, that aside
7931891 7934226 let me say that I swear
7935853 7938981 on the souls of my grandchildren,
7939065 7943444 that I will not be the one to break<br />the peace we've made here today.
7968928 7974392 Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's<br />drug middlemen have clean records?
7974475 7976602 Mention it. Don't insist.
7978604 7983526 - Barzini will know without being told.<br />- You mean Tattaglia.
7985152 7987113 Tattaglia's a pimp.
7988197 7991325 He could never have outfought Santino.
7993703 7999291 But I didn't know until this day<br />that it was Barzini all along.
8014765 8016851 Come on, Nancy.
8018060 8020646 Keep together, everyone. Brian.
8021981 8023649 Okay, all right.
8036746 8038956 How long have you been back?
8039749 8041584 I've been back a year.
8043002 8045129 Longer than that, I think.
8047965 8050134 It's good to see you, Kay.
8061187 8063731 I'm working for my father now, Kay.
8066233 8069236 He's been sick. Very sick.
8070780 8072740 But you're not like him.
8072823 8076619 You told me you weren't going to<br />become like your father.
8078537 8082833 My father is no different<br />than any other powerful man.
8082917 8086378 Any man who's responsible<br />for other people.
8087588 8090007 Like a senator or president.
8090090 8092551 - How naive you sound.<br />- Why?
8092635 8095471 They don't have men killed.
8098891 8100893 Who's being naive, Kay?
8102144 8106398 My father's way of doing things is over.<br />Even he knows that.
8107942 8112321 In five years the Corleone family<br />is going to be completely legitimate.
8114156 8118118 Trust me. That's all I can tell you<br />about my business. Kay…
8119578 8122706 Michael, why did you come here? Why?
8123999 8128838 What do you want with me after all<br />this time? I've been calling and writing.
8128921 8132424 I came because I need you.<br />I care for you.
8132508 8136345 - Please stop it, Michael.<br />- Because… I want you to marry me.
8138055 8140641 - It's too late.<br />- Please, Kay…
8142393 8146272 I'll do anything you ask<br />to make up for what's happened to us.
8147940 8152194 Because that's important, Kay.<br />Because what's important is that
8153737 8156991 we have each other.<br />That we have a life together.
8158576 8161287 That we have children. Our children.
8162788 8164957 Kay, I need you.
8166917 8168502 And I love you.
8190649 8194403 Barzini's people chisel my territory<br />and we do nothing about it!
8194528 8198157 - Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!<br />- Be patient.
8198240 8201368 I'm not asking for help.<br />Just take off the handcuffs.
8201452 8204580 - Be patient.<br />- We must protect ourselves.
8204663 8208125 - Let me recruit some new men.<br />- No.
8208208 8212087 - Barzini would get an excuse to fight.<br />- Mike, you're wrong.
8213589 8215758 Don Corleone…
8215841 8219970 You once said that one day Tessio<br />and me could form our own family.
8220054 8224099 Till today I would never think of it.<br />I must ask your permission.
8225100 8227770 Michael is now head of the family.
8227853 8232149 If he gives his permission,<br />then you have my blessing.
8232232 8234610 After we make the move to Nevada
8234693 8239114 you can leave the Corleone family<br />and go on your own.
8239198 8243535 - How long will that be?<br />- Six months.
8243619 8246872 Forgive me, but with you gone,
8246956 8249792 me and Pete<br />will come under Barzini's thumb.
8249875 8255547 I hate that Barzini. In six months' time<br />there will be nothing left to build on.
8255631 8258550 - Do you have faith in my judgment?<br />- Yes.
8258634 8261553 - Do I have your loyalty?<br />- Always, Godfather.
8261637 8264890 Then be a friend to Michael.<br />Do as he says.
8269812 8275150 Things are negotiated that'll solve your<br />problems and answer your questions.
8275234 8277569 That's all I can tell you now.
8278404 8280990 Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
8281073 8284451 When we make our move there,<br />you'll be my right -hand man.
8284535 8289331 Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.<br />He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
8289415 8291959 That's no reflection on Tom,<br />just how I want it.
8292042 8296755 If I ever need help, who's a better<br />consigliere than my father? That's it.
8316775 8320612 - Thank you, Papa.<br />- I'm happy for you, Carlo.
8320696 8323615 Mike… Why am I out?
8325117 8327828 You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.
8329121 8332374 Things may get rough with the move.
8332458 8333751 Tom.
8338922 8344094 I advised Michael. I never thought<br />you were a bad consigliere.
8344178 8348307 I thought Santino was a bad Don,<br />rest in peace.
8349767 8352978 Michael has all my confidence,<br />just as you do.
8353979 8358942 But there are reasons why you must<br />have no part in what is going to happen.
8359985 8363030 - Maybe I could help.<br />- You're out, Tom.
8412204 8416500 I can't get over the way your face looks.<br />So good!
8416625 8421213 This doctor did some job.<br />Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!
8421296 8425425 Leave them out here.<br />He's tired and wants to clean up.
8425509 8427886 Let me open the door, all right?
8434059 8439481 - Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!<br />- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.
8439565 8442192 - Your brother Freddy.<br />- Girls?
8446113 8449199 I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.
8450409 8453912 - Anything you want, kid, anything.<br />- Who are the girls?
8455330 8458750 - That's for you to find out.<br />- Get rid of them, Fredo.
8460294 8464965 - Hey, Mike…<br />- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.
8465048 8467718 I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.
8473599 8476894 Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.
8476977 8479104 Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.
8480814 8482941 Hey, come on! Scram!
8484610 8488155 Come on, honey. I don't know<br />what's the matter with him, Johnny.
8488238 8489531 Sorry.
8491491 8494036 I don't know. He's tired.
8504213 8508550 He had some business. He said to<br />give him a call when the party started.
8508634 8510594 Well, give him a call.
8511970 8515098 - Johnny, how are you?<br />- Nice to see you, Mike.
8515182 8517392 - We're proud of you.<br />- Thanks.
8517476 8521063 Sit down, I want to talk to you.<br />The Don is proud too.
8521146 8523398 Well, I owe it all to him.
8524608 8526193 He knows how grateful you are.
8526276 8529529 That's why<br />he'd like to ask a favor of you.
8529613 8531531 Mike, what can I do?
8532699 8535160 We're thinking of giving up our interests
8535244 8538163 in the olive oil business<br />and settling here.
8538997 8544336 Moe will sell us his share of the casino<br />and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.
8544419 8547172 - Tom!<br />- Are you sure?
8547256 8550259 Moe loves the business.<br />He never said nothing about selling.
8550342 8553053 I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
8554346 8556765 See, Johnny…
8556848 8561061 We figure that entertainment<br />would draw gamblers to the casino.
8561144 8564898 We hope you'll sign a contract<br />to appear five times a year.
8567818 8572447 Perhaps convince some of your friends<br />in the movies to do the same.
8573699 8575826 We're counting on you.
8577828 8581498 Sure, Mike.<br />I'll do anything for my godfather.
8581581 8582874 Good.
8584501 8589131 Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.<br />Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
8589214 8591758 - Good to see you.<br />- How are you, Moe?
8591883 8596972 Have everything? Specially prepared<br />food, the best dancers, and good credit.
8597055 8600642 Draw chips for everybody,<br />so they can play on the house.
8603312 8606064 Is my credit good enough<br />to buy you out?
8607816 8609651 Buy me out?
8609735 8612321 The casino, the hotel.
8612404 8615324 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy you out.
8615407 8620829 The Corleone family wants<br />to buy me out? No, I buy you out.
8620912 8624333 Your casino loses money.<br />We can do better.
8624416 8628295 - You think I'm skimming off the top?<br />- You're unlucky.
8633091 8635510 You Guineas make me laugh.
8635635 8640223 I took Freddy in when you had a bad<br />time, and now you try to push me out!
8641600 8645020 You did that<br />because we bankrolled your casino
8645103 8650359 and the Molinari family guaranteed<br />his safety. Let's talk business.
8650442 8653195 Yes. First of all, you're all done.
8653278 8655739 You don't have<br />that kind of muscle anymore.
8655864 8660243 The Godfather is sick. You're getting<br />chased out of New York by the others.
8660327 8664247 Do you think you can come to my hotel<br />and take over?
8664331 8669378 I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal<br />with him and still keep my hotel!
8669461 8672964 Is that why you slapped my brother<br />around in public?
8673048 8677886 That was nothing, Mike.<br />Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
8677969 8682182 He flies off the handle sometimes,<br />but we're good friends.
8682265 8687020 I have a business to run.<br />I've got to kick asses sometimes.
8691066 8693902 You straightened my brother out?
8693985 8698448 He was banging cocktail waitresses!<br />Players couldn't get a drink.
8698532 8700492 What's wrong with you?
8705372 8708500 I leave for New York tomorrow.<br />Think about a price.
8709418 8711044 Son -of-a -bitch!
8711128 8716299 I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones<br />when you were out with cheerleaders.
8716383 8718885 Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.
8720011 8723557 <i>Tom, you're the consigliere.<br />Talk to the Don…</i>
8723682 8729062 Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and<br />Mike is in charge of the family business.
8729146 8732482 If you have anything to say,<br />say it to Michael.
8737362 8742200 Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and<br />talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
8742951 8744161 Fredo…
8745370 8748123 You're my older brother, and I love you.
8749583 8753587 But don't ever take sides with anyone<br />against the family again.
8755088 8756089 Ever.
8764222 8768393 I have to see my father and his people,<br />so have dinner without me.
8770145 8775025 This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to<br />the city, see a show and have dinner.
8782407 8785452 Your sister wants to ask you something.
8785535 8787662 - Let her ask.<br />- She's afraid to.
8787746 8790707 They want you to be godfather<br />to their boy.
8790790 8792626 - We'll see.<br />- Will you?
8792709 8795045 Let me think about it. Come on.
8803929 8806806 Barzini will move against you first.
8806890 8811311 He'll set up a meeting with someone<br />you absolutely trust.
8811394 8813438 Guaranteeing your safety.
8814689 8817776 And at that meeting<br />you'll be assassinated.
8822489 8825492 I like to drink wine more than I used to.
8826910 8830413 - Anyway, I'm drinking more.<br />- It's good for you, Pop.
8835460 8836962 I don't know.
8839005 8841925 Are you happy with your wife<br />and children?
8842884 8845720 - Very happy.<br />- That's good.
8847597 8852477 I hope you don't mind the way I keep<br />going over this Barzini business.
8852561 8855522 - No, not at all.<br />- It's an old habit.
8856982 8859985 I spend my life trying not to be careless.
8861528 8864990 Women and children can be careless,<br />but not men.
8868326 8870662 - How's your boy?<br />- He's good.
8870787 8873498 He looks more like you every day.
8876209 8880672 He's smarter than I am. He's three<br />and can read the funny papers.
8882799 8884843 Read the funny papers.
8892058 8897689 I want you to arrange for a telephone<br />man to check all in - and out -going calls.
8897814 8903111 - I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.<br />- That's right. I forgot.
8907157 8908867 What's the matter?
8909701 8911745 What's bothering you?
8915332 8919961 I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,<br />so I'll handle it.
8933224 8937729 I knew that Santino<br />would have to go through all this.
8937812 8939439 And Fredo…
8942150 8944194 Fredo was, well…
8946071 8948907 But I never wanted this for you.
8951242 8956289 I worked my whole life. I don't apologize<br />for taking care of my family.
8956373 8960293 And I refused to be a fool,
8960377 8964506 dancing on a string<br />held by all those big shots.
8966466 8969928 I don't apologize. That's my life,<br />but I thought that,
8971596 8976768 that when it was your time, you would<br />be the one to hold the strings.
8978561 8984234 Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.<br />Something.
8984317 8987320 <i>Another pezzonovante.</i>
8987404 8989072 Well…
8992283 8996204 Just wasn't enough time, Michael.<br />Wasn't enough time.
8996287 8999791 We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.
9004629 9009092 Now listen, whoever comes to you<br />with this Barzini meeting,
9009175 9012137 he's the traitor. Don't forget that.
9029112 9031239 Can I hold it, please?
9046337 9050216 - Can I water these?<br />- Yes, go ahead.
9050300 9053094 Over here, over here.
9054971 9057474 Be careful. You're spilling it.
9063855 9065607 Anthony!
9065690 9067358 Come here, come here.
9072530 9075200 That's it. We'll put it right there.
9080413 9082999 I'll show you something. Come here.
9085043 9086920 Stand there.
9090673 9092425 Give me an orange!
9110777 9112570 That's a new trick.
9113571 9115907 You run in there. Run in there.
9129462 9131422 Where are you?
9309100 9311477 Mike, can I have a minute?
9321571 9324032 Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
9324115 9327410 He says we can straighten out<br />any of our problems.
9328077 9330288 - You talked to him?<br />- Yeah.
9331622 9335418 I can arrange security. On my territory.
9338463 9341007 - All right?<br />- All right.
9358524 9361486 Do you know<br />how they're going to come at you?
9363988 9367658 They're arranging a meeting<br />in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
9369827 9371621 Where I'll be safe.
9383883 9387470 I always thought it would be Clemenza,<br />not Tessio.
9387553 9391349 It's the smart move.<br />Tessio was always smarter.
9393601 9394894 But I'm going to wait.
9395561 9396562 After the baptism.
9400441 9404028 I've decided to be godfather<br />to Connie's baby.
9404112 9408282 And then I'll meet<br />with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
9409867 9412829 All the heads of the five families.
9553803 9558766 Michael, do you believe in God, the<br />Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?
9558849 9560017 I do.
9560101 9563604 <i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,<br />His only Son, our Lord?</i>
9563688 9564689 <i>I do.</i>
9564772 9568818 <i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,<br />the Holy Catholic Church?</i>
9568901 9570194 <i>I do.</i>
9635760 9640097 Michael Francis Rizzi,<br />do you renounce Satan?
9646354 9647605 I do renounce him.
9657281 9658699 And all his works?
9672588 9673631 I do renounce them.
9675383 9676634 Oh, God!
9679553 9683224 - And all his pomps?<br />- I do renounce them.
9703285 9704495 I will.
9711627 9717133 Michael Rizzi, go in peace,<br />and may the Lord be with you. Amen.
9731355 9733274 Kay!
9733357 9735317 Kiss your godfather.
9759717 9763804 Can't go to Vegas.<br />Something's come up.
9763888 9765556 Everybody has to leave without us.
9765639 9768601 - Mike, it's our first vacation!<br />- Connie, please.
9768726 9772229 Go back to the house, wait for my call.<br />It's important.
9773355 9775733 I'll only be a couple of days.
9791999 9794210 We're on our way to Brooklyn.
9796378 9800132 - I hope Mike can get us a good deal.<br />- I'm sure he will.
9807932 9813354 Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a<br />separate car, so you two go on ahead.
9813437 9816982 - That screws up my arrangements.<br />- That's what he said.
9817066 9819235 I can't go either, Sal.
9831205 9835125 Tell Mike it was only business.<br />I always liked him.
9836794 9839630 - He understands that.<br />- Excuse me, Sal.
9845636 9848097 Tom, can you get me off the hook?
9849265 9852434 - For old times' sake?<br />- Can't do it, Sally.
9897855 9900691 You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.
9905571 9909491 - Mike, you got it all wrong.<br />- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.
9910534 9914455 That little farce<br />you played with my sister.
9914538 9919627 - You think that could fool a Corleone?<br />- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.
9919710 9922421 - Please, don't do this.<br />- Sit down.
9925090 9927384 Don't do this to me, please.
9936644 9938395 Barzini is dead.
9940522 9942858 So is Philip Tattaglia.
9944068 9945569 Moe Greene.
9946528 9950324 Strachi. Cuneo.
9952284 9957539 Today I settle all family business,<br />so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
9957623 9959416 Admit what you did.
9963337 9965005 Get him a drink.
9971303 9972596 Come on.
9973931 9976350 Don't be afraid, Carlo.
9976433 9979311 Do you think<br />I 'd make my sister a widow?
9980437 9983148 I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.
9990072 9992116 Go ahead, drink, drink.
9996912 10000749 No, you're out of the family business.<br />That's your punishment.
10001834 10005796 You're finished.<br />I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.
10005879 10007506 Tom.
10011635 10015222 I want you to stay there. Understand?
10015305 10017891 Only don't tell me you're innocent.
10019143 10023397 Because it insults my intelligence.<br />Makes me very angry.
10027651 10029695 Who approached you?
10030988 10033198 Tattaglia or Barzini?
10041081 10042791 It was Barzini.
10046920 10048505 Good.
10054720 10058766 There's a car waiting outside<br />to take you to the airport.
10058849 10062394 I'll call your wife<br />and tell her what flight you're on.
10066690 10069234 - Mike…<br />- Get out of my sight.
10095385 10097012 Hello, Carlo.
10156864 10159992 - I'm trying to tell you…<br />- Mama, please!
10168375 10170460 Michael!
10170544 10172546 - What is it?<br />- Where is he?
10174965 10180095 Michael, you lousy bastard!<br />You killed my husband.
10180178 10184266 You waited until Papa died,<br />so nobody could stop you.
10184349 10187436 You blamed him for Sonny.<br />Everybody did.
10187519 10193317 But you never thought about me!<br />Now what are we going to do?
10193400 10195027 Connie.
10197279 10199990 Why do you think<br />he kept Carlo at the Mall?
10200073 10202910 He knew he was going to kill him.
10202993 10208332 And you stood godfather to our baby.<br />You lousy cold -hearted bastard!
10208415 10212502 Want to know how many men he had<br />killed with Carlo? Read the papers!
10212586 10215339 That's your husband,<br />that's your husband!
10225015 10229227 No! No, no…
10229311 10232689 Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.
10253835 10255545 She's hysterical.
10260092 10261843 Hysterical.
10263845 10265555 Michael, is it true?
10267557 10271228 - Don't ask me about my business, Kay.<br />- Is it true?
10271311 10274064 Don't ask me about my business.<br />Enough!
10294126 10295627 All right.
10298463 10300215 This one time.
10304177 10307514 This one time<br />I'll let you ask me about my affairs.
10313603 10315022 Is it true?
10319109 10320610 Is it?
10322362 10323739 No.
10337669 10340630 I guess we both need a drink. Come on.
10371912 10373622 Don Corleone.
