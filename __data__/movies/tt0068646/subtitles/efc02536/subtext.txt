51324 54197 BONASERA: I believe in America.
54240 57287 America has made my fortune.
57330 61465 And I raised my daughter<br />in the American fashion.
61508 66383 I gave her freedom, but I taught<br />her never to dishonor her family.
67776 70996 She found a boyfriend,<br />not an Italian.
71040 73085 She went to the movies<br />with him.
73129 75522 She stayed out late.
75566 78308 I didn't protest.
78351 83052 Two months ago he took her for<br />a drive with another boyfriend.
84009 86795 They made her drink whiskey
86838 91234 and then they tried to<br />take advantage of her.
91277 95412 She resisted,<br />she kept her honor.
96630 99721 So they beat her<br />like an animal.
101592 106640 When I went to the hospital,<br />her nose was broken,
106684 111080 her jaw was shattered,<br />held together by wire.
113256 116694 She couldn't even weep<br />because of the pain.
118740 122221 But I wept.<br />Why did I weep?
124920 127270 She was the light<br />of my life.
129228 130926 Beautiful girl.
134668 137454 Now she will never be<br />beautiful again.
141284 142285 [COUGHS]
144069 145505 Sorry.
153862 158431 I went to the police,<br />like a good American.
158475 162305 These two boys<br />were brought to trial.
162348 165134 The judge sentenced them<br />to three years in prison,
165177 167310 but suspended<br />the sentence.
168485 170835 Suspended the sentence!
170879 173577 They went free<br />that very day!
175840 179148 I stood in the courtroom<br />like a fool.
179191 182673 And those two bastards,<br />they smiled at me.
183892 185371 Then I said to my wife,
185415 189462 "For justice,<br />we must go to Don Corleone."
194903 196339 VITO: Why did you<br />go to the police?
196382 198515 Why didn't you<br />come to me first?
199429 201039 What do you want of me?
201083 205522 Tell me anything,<br />but do what I beg you to do.
205565 207219 What is that?
218404 220232 [WHISPERING]<br />I want them dead.
231722 233028 That I cannot do.
234986 237467 I'll give you<br />anything you ask.
239817 241645 We've known each<br />other many years,
241688 246389 but this is the first time you ever<br />came to me for counsel, for help.
246432 248870 I can't remember<br />the last time that
248913 252699 you invited me to your house<br />for a cup of coffee.
252743 256573 Even though my wife is<br />godmother to your only child.
256616 258618 But let's be frank here.
258662 261665 You never wanted<br />my friendship.
261708 265495 And you were afraid<br />to be in my debt.
265538 267932 BONASERA: I didn't want<br />to get into trouble.
269151 270717 I understand.
272241 275113 You found Paradise<br />in America.
277333 279248 You had a good trade,<br />made a good living,
279291 282164 Police protected you<br />and there were courts of law.
282207 284035 You didn't need<br />a friend like me.
286472 290085 But now you come<br />to me and you say,
290128 292565 "Don Corleone,<br />give me justice."
294480 297440 But you don't ask<br />with respect.
297483 303881 You don't offer friendship. You<br />don't even think to call me Godfather.
303925 307363 You said you'd come into my house on<br />the day my daughter is to be married
307406 310801 and ask me to do<br />murder for money.
310844 313412 BONASERA:<br />I ask you for justice.
313456 316111 That is not justice.<br />Your daughter is still alive.
317416 320942 Let them suffer, then,<br />as she suffers.
322813 323945 How much shall I pay you?
331300 332649 [CAT MEOWS]
339961 343921 Bonasera, Bonasera.
343965 348143 What have I ever done to make<br />you treat me so disrespectfully?
349274 351885 If you'd come to me<br />in friendship,
351929 357413 then the scum that ruined your daughter<br />would be suffering this very day.
357456 359806 And if by chance,<br />an honest man like yourself
359850 362592 should make enemies,<br />then they would become my enemies.
365551 368206 And then they<br />would fear you.
371644 372732 Be my friend?
377607 378695 Godfather?
383874 385006 Good.
387182 389488 Some day, and that day<br />may never come,
389532 392317 I'll call upon you<br />to do a service for me.
393666 397583 But, uh... until that day
397627 401935 accept this justice as a gift<br />on my daughter's wedding day.
401979 403285 Grazie, Godfather.
403328 404547 Prego.
404590 405939 [PEOPLE CHATTERING OUTSIDE]

694663 696752 Now that<br />the war is over,
696795 700886 this boy, Enzo, they want to<br />repatriate him back to Italy.
700930 703367 Godfather, I have a daughter.
703411 706979 You see, she and Enzo...
707023 710679 You want Enzo to stay in this country,<br />and your daughter to be married.

783404 786581 He didn't expect to be invited to the<br />wedding, so he wanted to thank you.
786624 789322 All right.
789366 794763 Don Corleone, I'm honored and grateful<br />that you have invited me to your home
794806 797635 on the wedding day<br />of your daughter.

838763 840243 Nice to meet you.
842114 844813 If he's your brother,<br />why does he have a different name?
844856 847163 Oh, back when my brother,<br />Sonny, was a kid,
847206 848817 he found Tom Hagen<br />on the street.
848860 852734 And he had no home, and so<br />my father took him in.
854518 855911 And he's been with us<br />ever since.
857695 859610 He's a good lawyer.
860481 862831 Not a Sicilian.
862874 865094 I think he's going<br />to be consigliere.
865137 866225 What's that?
866269 868140 That's a,

1172531 1173968 Well, when Johnny<br />was first starting out,
1174011 1177406 he was signed to this<br />personal service contract
1177449 1180409 with a big bandleader.
1180452 1182541 And as his career<br />got better and better,
1182585 1185675 he wanted to get out of it.
1185718 1188504 Now, Johnny<br />is my father's godson.
1188547 1191855 And my father went<br />to see this bandleader.
1191899 1195598 And he offered him $10,000<br />to let Johnny go,
1195641 1198557 but the bandleader<br />said no.
1198601 1200821 So the next day
1200864 1204302 my father went to see him,<br />only this time with Luca Brasi.
1206000 1208437 And within an hour,
1208480 1213921 he signed a release for a<br />certified check of $1,000.
1215618 1217402 Well, how did he do that?
1217446 1219404 My father made him an<br />offer he couldn't refuse.
1221015 1221972 What was that?
1223408 1226281 Luca Brasi held a gun<br />to his head,
1226324 1228500 and my father assured him<br />that either his brain
1228544 1231503 or his signature<br />would be on the contract.

1511870 1514351 Never. Give him a living,

1669811 1671203 All right, start talking.
1671247 1674729 I was sent by a friend<br />of Johnny Fontane.
1674772 1678515 This friend is my client. He would give<br />his undying friendship to Mr. Woltz,
1678559 1681431 if Mr. Woltz would<br />grant us a small favor.
1681475 1683912 Woltz is listening.
1683955 1687959 Give Johnny the part in that new<br />war film you're starting next week.
1689221 1690571 [CHUCKLES]
1693748 1698840 And, uh... What favor would<br />your friend grant Mr. Woltz?
1698883 1702409 You're gonna have some union problems,<br />my client could make them disappear.
1702452 1706543 Also one of your top stars has just<br />moved from marijuana to heroin.
1706587 1708328 Are you trying to muscle me?<br />Absolutely not...
1708371 1710982 Now, listen to me,<br />you smooth talking son-of-a-bitch!
1711026 1713637 Let me lay it on the line for<br />you and your boss, whoever he is.
1713681 1715639 Johnny Fontane will<br />never get that movie!
1715683 1717249 I don't care how many
1717293 1720296 Dago Guinea wop greaseball<br />goombahs come out of the woodwork!
1720340 1721732 I'm German-Irish.
1721776 1724256 Well, let me tell you<br />something, my Kraut-Mick friend.
1724300 1727303 I'm going to make so much trouble<br />for you! You won't know what hit ya.
1727347 1728957 Mr. Woltz. I'm a lawyer.<br />I have not threatened...
1729000 1732264 I know almost every big lawyer in<br />New York. Who the hell are you?
1732308 1735920 I have a special practice.<br />I handle one client.
1735964 1737531 Now you have my number,<br />I'll wait for your call.
1739576 1742579 By the way, I admire<br />your pictures very much.
1747367 1748629 Check him out.
1771391 1772914 It's really beautiful.
1772957 1774045 Look at this.
1774089 1776134 It used to decorate<br />a king's palace.
1776178 1778659 Yeah. Very nice.
1778702 1781139 WOLTZ: Why didn't you say<br />you work for Corleone, Tom?
1781183 1783446 I thought you were some<br />cheap two-bit hustler
1783490 1785535 Johnny was running in,<br />trying to bluff me.
1785579 1787755 I don't like to use his name<br />until it's really necessary.
1787798 1789670 WOLTZ:<br />How's your drink, Tom? Fine.
1789713 1792455 Hey come on over here with me. I wanna<br />show you something really beautiful.
1792499 1795023 You do appreciate<br />beauty, don't you?
1798026 1801116 There you are.<br />$600,000 on four hoofs.
1801159 1805033 I'll bet Russian czars never paid<br />that kinda dough for a single horse.
1805076 1808558 Khartoum.
1810038 1812693 I'm not going<br />to race him, though.
1812736 1814521 I'm going to put<br />him out to stud.
1816131 1817393 Thanks, Tony.<br />Welcome.
1818438 1821484 Let's get something<br />to eat, huh?
1821528 1824966 TOM: Corleone is<br />Johnny's godfather.
1825009 1829318 To the Italian people that's a very<br />religious, sacred, close relationship.
1829361 1830798 WOLTZ: And I respect that.
1830841 1833453 Just tell him, he should<br />ask me anything else.
1833496 1835759 But this is one favor<br />I can't give him.
1835803 1838283 Well, he never asks a second favor<br />when he's been refused the first.
1838327 1839415 Understood?
1839459 1841417 You don't understand.
1841461 1845639 Johnny Fontane never<br />gets that movie.
1845682 1849469 That part is perfect for him.<br />It'll make him a big star.
1849512 1855387 I'm going to run him out of the<br />business, and let me tell you why.
1855431 1860131 Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz<br />International's most valuable proteges.
1860175 1862569 For five years,<br />we had her under training.
1862612 1865615 Singing lessons, acting<br />lessons, dancing lessons.
1865659 1868096 I spent hundreds of thousands<br />of dollars on her,
1868139 1870272 I was gonna make<br />her a big star.
1870315 1873188 And let me be<br />even more frank.
1873231 1875538 Just to show you that<br />I'm not a hardhearted man.
1875582 1878236 That it's not all<br />dollars and cents.
1878280 1881936 She was beautiful.<br />She was young, she was innocent!
1881979 1884242 She's the greatest<br />piece of ass I've had
1884286 1887463 and I've had them<br />all over the world.
1887507 1893556 And then Johnny Fontane comes along with<br />his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
1893600 1896646 And she runs off.
1896690 1900911 She threw it all away just<br />to make me look ridiculous!
1900955 1906134 And a man in my position can't<br />afford to be made to look ridiculous!
1906177 1908571 Now you get<br />the hell out of here!
1908615 1910747 If that goombah<br />tries any rough stuff,
1910791 1912923 you tell him<br />I ain't no bandleader.
1914272 1918059 Yeah, I heard that story.
1918102 1922150 Thank you for the dinner<br />and a very pleasant evening.
1922193 1925153 Maybe your car can<br />take me to the airport.
1925196 1928678 Mr. Corleone is a man who insists<br />on hearing bad news immediately.
2016679 2018333 [WOLTZ SCREAMING]
2026689 2028473 [SCREAMING CONTINUES]
2041399 2043010 You're not too tired,<br />are you, Tom?
2043053 2045360 Oh, no, I slept<br />on the plane.
2045403 2048493 I have the<br />Sollozzo notes here.
2048537 2049756 Now...
2051758 2055413 Sollozzo is known<br />as The Turk.
2055457 2057502 He's supposed to be<br />very good with a knife,
2057546 2061942 but only in matters of business with<br />some sort of reasonable complaint.
2061985 2066076 Uh, his business is narcotics.
2066120 2068775 He has fields in Turkey,<br />where they grow poppy.
2068818 2072692 In Sicily he has plants<br />to process them into heroin.
2072735 2076260 Now, he needs cash,<br />he needs protection from the police.
2076304 2078480 For which, he gives<br />a piece of the action.
2078523 2080395 I couldn't find out how much.
2080438 2083354 The Tattaglia family is<br />behind him here in New York.
2083398 2085617 Now, they have to be<br />in it for something.
2086923 2088664 What about his<br />prison record?
2088708 2091580 Two terms.<br />One in Italy, one here.
2091623 2094409 He's known as<br />a top narcotics man.
2094452 2096324 Santino,<br />what do you think?
2097760 2099588 A lot of money<br />in that white powder.
2101416 2102852 Tom?
2102896 2104854 TOM: Well I say, Yes.
2104898 2107117 There's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at.
2107161 2110033 Now, if we don't get into it, somebody else will,
2110077 2111948 Maybe the five families,<br />maybe all of them
2111992 2113733 Now with the money they earn,
2113776 2116431 they can buy more Police<br />and political power.
2116474 2118738 Then they come after us.
2118781 2121088 Now we have the unions,<br />we have the gambling,
2121131 2122654 and they're the best<br />things to have,
2122698 2125309 but narcotics is the thing<br />of the future.
2125353 2127007 If we don't get a piece<br />of that action,
2127050 2128182 we risk everything we have.
2128225 2130837 I mean, not now,<br />but in 10 years from now.
2135015 2137931 So? What's your answer<br />gonna be, Pop?
2142892 2145242 Don Corleone.
2146766 2150030 I need a man who<br />has powerful friends.
2150073 2152902 I need a million<br />dollars in cash.
2152946 2155165 I need, Don Corleone,<br />those politicians
2155209 2158778 you carry in your pocket,<br />like so many nickels and dimes.
2160170 2162259 What is the interest<br />for my family?
2162607 2164435 30%.
2164479 2167090 In the first year your end should<br />be three, four million dollars.
2168396 2171573 And then it would go up.
2171616 2173880 And what is the interest<br />for the Tattaglia family?
2177057 2178841 My compliments.
2182453 2184934 I'll take care of the<br />Tattaglias, out of my share.
2186022 2190418 So I receive 30%<br />for finance,
2190461 2193508 political influence and legal protection,<br />that's what your telling me?
2193551 2194596 That's right.
2196772 2200863 Why do you come to me?<br />Why do I deserve this generosity?
2200907 2206260 If you consider a million<br />dollars in cash just finance,
2206303 2208436 te salud, Don Corleone.
2218838 2224060 I said that I would see you, because<br />I heard that you were a serious man,
2224104 2226497 to be treated<br />with respect.
2231067 2234331 But, I must say no to you.
2235593 2238553 And I'll give you<br />my reasons.
2238596 2241382 It's true,<br />I have a lot of friends in politics.
2242600 2244428 But they wouldn't be<br />friendly very long
2244472 2246996 if they knew my business was<br />drugs instead of gambling,
2247040 2250217 which they regard<br />as a harmless vice,
2250260 2252915 but drugs<br />is a dirty business. Oh, Don Corleone...
2252959 2257920 It doesn't make any difference to me<br />what a man does for a living, understand.
2257964 2261402 But your business is...
2261445 2263186 A little dangerous.
2263230 2265972 If you're worried about<br />security for your million,
2266015 2267799 the Tattaglias<br />will guarantee it.
2267843 2270106 Are you telling me the Tattaglias<br />would guarantee our investment...
2270150 2271412 Wait a minute.
2278549 2283163 I have a sentimental weakness for my children,<br />and I spoil them, as you can see...
2283206 2284512 They talk when<br />they should listen.
2285339 2286818 But anyway...
2286862 2289299 SignorSollozzo,<br />my no is final.
2289343 2292259 And I wish to congratulate<br />you on your new business.
2292302 2295740 I know you'll do very well,<br />and good luck to you.
2295784 2300615 Especially since your interests<br />don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
2321331 2323159 Santino.
2323203 2324769 Come here.
2327381 2329600 What's the matter with you?
2329644 2334127 I think your brain is going soft from all that<br />comedy you're playing with that young girl.
2334170 2337304 Never tell anybody outside the<br />family what you're thinking again.

2347792 2351100 It's from Johnny.<br />He's starring in that new film.
2351144 2352406 Huh.

2865962 2867877 [KNOCK ON DOOR]
2868399 2870750 Stay back there.
2870793 2873448 Who is it?<br />Open up, it's Clemenza.
2875929 2879193 There's more news<br />about your old man.
2879236 2881151 Word is out that<br />he's already dead.
2881195 2883327 What's the matter...<br />What's the matter with you?
2883371 2885634 Take it easy!<br />Take it easy!
2885678 2887027 Where was Paulie?
2887070 2889029 Paulie was out sick.<br />He's been sick all winter.
2889072 2890204 How many times<br />he been sick?
2890247 2892032 Only maybe three, four times.
2892075 2893816 I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants<br />me to get a different bodyguard
2893860 2895818 He said no. Pick him up now.<br />Do me a favour, pick him up right now.
2895862 2897733 I don't care how sick he is.<br />If he's breathing,
2897777 2900301 I want you to bring him to my father's<br />house now, you understand? Now.
2900344 2901781 Yeah, You want me to<br />send any people over here?
2901824 2903913 No, no, no. Just you and him.<br />Go ahead.
2903957 2905393 [BABY CRYING]
2910659 2912748 Okay, I'm...
2912792 2915098 I'm going to have a couple of our people<br />come over to the house. Couple of our people.
2915142 2916883 [TELEPHONE RINGING]
2919538 2920626 Hello?
2920669 2921801 SOLLOZZO:<br />Santino Corleone?
2921844 2924717 Yeah.<br />We have Tom Hagen.
2924760 2928547 You got three hours he'll be<br />released with our proposition.
2928590 2931985 Listen to everything he has<br />to say before you do anything.
2932028 2933508 What's done is done.
2933552 2936642 And don't lose that famous<br />temper of yours, eh, Sonny?
2936685 2938382 I'll wait.
2938426 2940036 [HANGS UP]
2952571 2954573 SOLLOZZO:<br />Your boss is dead.
2957619 2959926 I know you're not in the<br />muscle end of the family, Tom,
2959969 2963059 so I don't want<br />you to be scared.
2963103 2966410 I want you to help the Corleones<br />and I want you to help me.
2970937 2975419 Yeah, we got him outside his office just<br />about an hour after we picked you up.
2976899 2978074 Drink it.
2982818 2986039 So now, It's up to you to make<br />the peace between me and Sonny.
2990609 2993307 Sonny was hot for my deal,<br />wasn't he?
2994787 2996440 And you knew it was<br />the right thing to do.
2998791 3001881 Sonny will come after you<br />with everything he's got.
3001924 3003796 That will be his<br />first reaction, sure.
3005145 3008148 So you gotta talk<br />some sense into him.
3008191 3011934 The Tattaglia family is behind<br />me with all their people.
3011978 3017070 The other New York families will go along with<br />anything that will prevent the full-scale war.
3017113 3019638 Let's face it, Tom<br />and all due respect,
3019681 3022249 the Don, rest in peace,<br />was slipping.
3025295 3026993 Ten years ago,<br />could I have gotten to him?
3032172 3033521 Well, now he's dead.
3033564 3036089 He's dead, Tom,<br />and nothing can bring him back.
3037786 3040180 So you gotta talk to Sonny,
3040223 3044445 You gotta talk to the Caporegimes,<br />Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.
3048667 3049972 It's good business, Tom.
3052235 3057414 I'll try. But even Sonny won't<br />be able to call off Luca Brasi.
3060069 3061897 Yeah, well...
3063638 3066162 Let me worry about Luca.
3071385 3073648 You just talk to Sonny.
3073692 3076042 And the other two kids.
3079045 3080350 I'll do my best.
3080960 3082178 Good.
3083876 3086705 Now you can go.
3093059 3095626 I don't like violence, Tom.
3095670 3097890 I'm a businessman.
3097933 3100457 Blood is a big expense.
3103460 3105985 [HORN HONKING]
3121435 3123393 He's still alive.
3123437 3127484 They hit him with five<br />shots, and he's still alive!
3127528 3132141 That's bad luck for me, and bad luck<br />for you if you don't make that deal.
3176925 3178971 Your mother is over in the<br />hospital with your father.
3179014 3181843 Looks like he's gonna<br />pull through. Thank God.
3183714 3186108 It's a lot of<br />bad blood.
3186152 3190373 Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia,<br />Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...
3190417 3191635 MICHAEL: You gonna<br />kill all those guys?
3191679 3193637 Hey, stay out of it, Mickey.<br />Do me a favour.
3193681 3196379 TOM: Sollozzo's the key, you get rid<br />of him, everything falls into line.
3196423 3200819 What about Luca?<br />Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
3200862 3204648 I don't know if Luca sold out, we're in a<br />lot of trouble. Believe me, lot of trouble.
3204692 3206302 Has anyone been<br />in touch with Luca?
3206346 3208391 Yeah, we've been trying all night.<br />He might be shacked up.
3208435 3209740 Hey, Mickey, do me a favor...
3209784 3212395 TOM: Luca never<br />sleeps over with a broad.
3214484 3217923 Well, Tom,<br />you're consigliere.
3217966 3220839 What do we do if the old man dies?<br />God forbid.
3220882 3224103 If we lose the old man,
3224146 3227193 we lose the political contacts<br />and half our strength.
3227236 3230109 The other New York families<br />might wind up supporting Sollozzo
3230152 3232894 just to avoid a long,<br />destructive war.
3232938 3237507 This is almost 1946.<br />Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
3237551 3239031 If your father dies,
3241642 3243513 you make the deal, Sonny.
3243557 3246125 You know, that's easy for you to<br />say, Tom. He's not your father.
3246168 3247909 I was as much a son<br />to him, as you or Mike.
3251652 3252914 [KNOCK ON DOOR]
3252958 3254481 What is it?
3255482 3257963 Paulie, I told you<br />to stay put.
3258006 3259442 Well, the guy<br />at the gates. They...
3259486 3261314 They said they<br />got a package. Yeah?
3261357 3263446 Tessio, go see<br />what it is.
3266667 3267798 You want me<br />to hang around?
3267842 3269104 SONNY: Yeah, hang around.<br />You all right?
3269148 3270758 Yeah, I'm fine.<br />Yeah?
3270801 3273195 There's some food in the house.<br />Are you hungry or anything?
3273239 3275197 No, it's all right.
3275241 3276590 How about a drink? How about a little<br />brandy? It's good to sweat it out.
3276633 3278244 All right, sure.<br />Go ahead.
3278287 3281116 That might be<br />a good idea. Yeah, right.
3281160 3283292 I want you to take care of that<br />son-of-a-bitch, right away.
3283336 3285773 Paulie sold out<br />the old man. That stronz...
3285816 3287340 I don't wanna<br />see him again.
3287383 3289255 Make that the first thing on your list.<br />Understand?
3289298 3290517 Understood.
3290560 3292040 Hey, Mickey, tomorrow,
3292084 3293824 You get a couple of guys,<br />you go over to Luca's apartment.
3293868 3295652 Hang around,<br />wait for him to show up.
3295696 3298960 Uh, maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br />mixed up in this too directly.
3301397 3304879 Listen, uh... Hanging around the house<br />on the phone would be a big help, huh.
3306011 3307882 Try Luca again.
3316804 3317936 What's the hell is this?
3317979 3319720 TESSIO: That's<br />a Sicilian message.
3319763 3322201 It means Luca Brasi<br />sleeps with the fishes.

3536328 3541985 Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,<br />you fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.
3542029 3546076 You get it to a boil, you shove in<br />all your sausage and your meatballs.
3547948 3549993 Add a little bit<br />of wine.

4190677 4192331 in the morning<br />and show cause.
4193201 4194550 All right.<br />Let him go.
4195987 4197162 Come on.
4227583 4229585 What's with<br />all the new faces?
4229629 4231544 We'll need<br />them now.
4231587 4234547 After the hospital thing,<br />Sonny got mad.
4234590 4237463 We hit Bruno Tattaglia<br />four o'clock this morning.
4238856 4240379 Jesus Christ.
4247560 4249475 Looks like<br />a fortress around here.
4252173 4254567 Tamaduch! Hey...
4254610 4257657 A 100 buttonmen on the<br />street 24 hours a day.
4257700 4260660 That Turk shows one hair<br />on his ass, he's dead.
4263271 4265317 Hey, Mike, come here.<br />Let me look at you.
4269408 4272585 You're beautiful, beautiful.<br />You're gorgeous.
4272628 4273847 Hey, listen to this.
4273891 4275675 The Turk, he wants to talk!
4275718 4278243 Imagine the nerve<br />of the son-of-a-bitch, eh?
4278286 4280158 Craps all last night.<br />He wants a meeting today.
4280201 4281376 What did he say?
4281420 4283683 What did he say...<br />[BABBLING]
4283726 4286033 He wants us to send Michael<br />to hear the proposition.
4286077 4288993 And he promises that the deal<br />is too good to refuse.
4289036 4290995 Eh?<br />What about Bruno Tattaglia?
4291038 4292692 That's part<br />of the deal.
4292735 4294868 Bruno cancels out what<br />they did to my Father.
4294912 4297088 Sonny, we ought to hear<br />what they have to say.
4297131 4300395 No. No. No more!<br />Not this time, Consigliere.
4300439 4303964 No more meetings, no more discussions,<br />no more or Sollozzo tricks.
4304008 4305835 You give them one message.<br />I want Sollozzo,
4305879 4307098 or then it's all out war,<br />we go to ...
4307141 4308621 The other families<br />won't sit still...
4308664 4310318 They hand me<br />Sollozzo!
4310362 4312712 I don't want to hear this!<br />This is business, not personal!
4312755 4314583 They shot my father...
4314627 4317891 Even the issue with your father<br />was business, not personal, Sonny.
4317935 4319893 Well, then business will have to<br />suffer, all right?
4319937 4321721 And listen,<br />do me a favor, Tom.
4321764 4323592 No more advice<br />on how to patch things up.
4323636 4325290 Just help me win,<br />please, all right?
4330730 4332514 [SIGHS]
4332558 4334777 I found out about this Captain<br />McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.
4334821 4336518 What about him?
4336562 4339173 He's definitely on Sollozzo's<br />payroll, and for big money.
4339217 4340609 See?
4340653 4342481 McCluskey has agreed<br />to be The Turk's bodyguard.
4342524 4344526 What you have<br />to understand, Sonny,
4344570 4348356 is that while Sollozzo is being<br />guarded like this, he's invulnerable.
4348400 4352099 Nobody has ever gunned down a<br />New York police captain. Never.
4352143 4355320 It would be disastrous. All the five<br />families would come after you, Sonny.
4355363 4358105 The Corleone family<br />would be outcasts!
4358149 4361239 Even the old man's political<br />protection would run for cover.
4363284 4367114 So, do me a favor.<br />Take this into consideration.
4369377 4370770 [SIGHS]
4370813 4372380 All right, we'll wait.
4378212 4382521 We can't wait.<br />We can't wait.
4382564 4384392 I don't care what Sollozzo<br />says, about a deal,
4384436 4386742 he's going to kill Pop.<br />That's it.
4386786 4389571 That's the key for him.<br />We've got to get Sollozzo.
4390442 4392313 Mike is right.
4392357 4394881 SONNY: Let me ask you something.<br />I mean...
4394924 4397797 What about<br />this McCluskey, eh?
4397840 4399712 What do we do<br />with this cop here?
4404543 4406545 They want to have a meeting with<br />me, right?
4408460 4412855 It will be me,<br />McCluskey and Sollozzo.
4414727 4416120 Let's set the meeting.
4418992 4422039 Get our informers to find out<br />where it's going to be held.
4424563 4428393 Now we insist it's a public place.<br />A bar, a restaurant.
4428436 4432092 Some place where there's<br />people, so I feel safe.
4434964 4437967 They're gonna search me<br />when I meet them, right?
4438011 4439708 So I can't have<br />a weapon on me then.
4443756 4448630 But if Clemenza can figure way to<br />have a weapon planted there for me
4453635 4454984 then I'll kill them both.

4462557 4464385 [ALL LAUGHING]
4466474 4467867 SONNY: Hey.
4467910 4469825 What are you gonna do?
4469869 4472785 Nice college boy, huh? Didn't want to<br />get mixed up in the family business.
4472828 4474352 Now you want to gun down<br />a police captain,
4474395 4476528 why, because he slapped you<br />in the face a little bit, huh?
4476571 4478965 What do you think, this is the army<br />where you shoot them a mile away?
4479008 4480575 You got to get close like<br />this, bada bing!
4480619 4483187 You blow their brains all over<br />your nice Ivy League suit.
4483230 4486364 Come here.<br />You're taking this very personal.
4486407 4489845 Tom, this is business, and this man<br />is taking it very, very personal.
4489889 4491586 Where does it say<br />you can't kill a cop?
4492457 4493719 Come on, Mikey...
4493762 4495721 Tom, wait a minute.<br />I'm talking about a cop
4495764 4497288 that's mixed up in drugs.
4497331 4500421 I'm talking about<br />a dishonest cop.
4500465 4504904 A crooked cop who got mixed up in the<br />rackets and got what was coming to him.
4504947 4508299 That's a terrific story. We have<br />newspaper people on the payroll,
4508342 4509474 don't we, Tom?
4510953 4512868 They might like<br />a story like that.
4512912 4514740 They might.<br />They just might.
4518483 4521921 It's not personal, Sonny.<br />It's strictly business.
4525185 4526839 CLEMENZA: It's as cold<br />as they come.
4526882 4530451 Impossible to trace,<br />so you don't worry about prints, Mike.
4530495 4533280 I put a special tape on<br />the trigger and the butt.
4533324 4534499 Here. Try it.
4546728 4548687 What's the matter?<br />Is the trigger too tight?
4551907 4553518 [CHUCKLING] I don't know.<br />My ears!
4553561 4555389 Yeah, I left it noisy.
4555433 4559306 That way it scares away any<br />pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.
4559350 4561395 All right. You've shot them both.<br />Now what do you do?
4564224 4566531 Sit down,<br />finish my dinner.
4566574 4568359 Come on, kid.<br />Don't fool around.
4568402 4571927 Just let your hand drop to your<br />side and let the gun slip out.
4571971 4574147 Everybody will still think<br />you've got it.
4574191 4576454 They're gonna be staring<br />at your face, Mike,
4576497 4579370 so walk out of the place<br />real fast, but you don't run.
4579413 4580893 Don't look nobody<br />directly in the eye,
4580936 4582895 but don't look away either.
4582938 4584940 Hey, they're gonna be scared<br />stiff of you, believe me,
4584984 4586203 so don't worry<br />about nothing.
4588466 4590337 You know, you're gonna<br />turn out all right.
4590381 4592818 You'll take a vacation,<br />nobody knows where,
4592861 4594123 and we're gonna<br />catch the hell.
4595560 4597388 How bad do you think<br />it's gonna be?
4597431 4599520 Pretty goddamn bad.
4599564 4602697 Probably all the other families<br />will line up against us.
4602741 4605613 But it's all right. These things<br />have to happen every five years or so.
4605657 4606832 Ten years...
4606875 4608312 How else do you get rid<br />of the bad blood.
4608355 4611010 Been 10 years<br />since the last one.
4611053 4612838 You know, you got to stop<br />them at the beginning.
4612881 4615057 Like they should have<br />stopped Hitler in Munich.
4615101 4616755 They should've never let him<br />get away with that.
4616798 4619932 They were just asking<br />for big trouble.
4619975 4623718 You know, Mike, we was all proud of you.<br />Being a hero and all.
4624502 4625764 Your father too.
4635382 4636383 [CLICKS]
4653922 4655184 [SIGHS]
4664324 4668720 Nothing. Not a hint.<br />Absolutely nothing.
4668763 4671505 Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br />where the meeting's gonna be held.
4673028 4676293 How much time<br />do we have?
4676336 4678904 They're going to pick you up in front of<br />Jack Dempsey's joint in an hour and a half.
4678947 4682037 Exactly an hour and a half.
4682081 4684953 CLEMENZA: We could put a tail on them.<br />See how that turns out.
4684997 4686912 Sollozzo would lose our<br />ass going around the block.
4688305 4690132 What about<br />the negotiator?
4690176 4692961 He's over at my place playing<br />pinochle with a couple of my men.
4693005 4695355 He's happy.<br />They're letting him win.
4695399 4698010 It's too much of a risk for Mike.<br />Maybe we ought to call if off, Sonny.
4698053 4701622 The negotiator keeps on playing cards<br />until Mike comes back safe and sound.
4701666 4704016 So why doesn't he just blast<br />whoever is in the goddamn car.
4704059 4705670 CLEMENZA: It's dangerous.<br />They'll be looking for that.
4705713 4707976 Sollozzo might not even<br />be in the car, Sonny!
4708020 4709108 [TELEPHONE RINGING]
4709151 4710327 I'll get it.
4720946 4724428 Yeah.
4725254 4726386 Okay.
4736004 4738224 Louis' restaurant<br />in the Bronx.
4738267 4739573 Is it reliable?
4739617 4741706 That's my man in<br />McCluskey's precinct.
4741749 4744230 A police captain has got to<br />be on call 24 hours a day.
4744273 4746580 He signed out at that number<br />between eight and ten.
4747494 4748669 Anybody know this joint?
4748713 4752412 Yeah, sure, I do.<br />It's perfect for us.
4752456 4754588 A small family place,<br />good food.
4754632 4758157 Everyone minds<br />his business. It's perfect.
4758200 4760289 They've got<br />an old-fashioned toilet.
4760333 4763554 You know, the box<br />and the chain thing.
4765294 4768385 We might be able to<br />tape the gun behind it.
4768428 4772606 All right. Mike,<br />you go to the restaurant,
4772650 4776654 you eat, you talk for a while,<br />you relax. You make them relax.
4776697 4778438 Then you get up<br />and you go to take a leak.
4778482 4782137 No, better still,<br />you ask for permission to go.
4782181 4783748 Then you come back,<br />you come out blasting.
4783791 4786838 And don't take any chances.<br />Two shots in the head apiece.
4786881 4788579 Now listen.
4788622 4790929 I want somebody good,<br />and I mean very good to plant that gun.
4790972 4792539 I don't want my brother<br />coming out of the toilet
4792583 4794454 with just his dick<br />in his hands, all right?
4794498 4796325 The gun will be there.
4796369 4799198 All right, listen. You drive him and<br />you pick him up after the job is done.
4800155 4801505 Come on.<br />Let's move.
4807380 4810514 Did he tell you to drop<br />the gun right away?
4810557 4812124 Yeah, a million times.
4817172 4819000 You don't forget.
4819044 4821655 Two shots apiece in the head as soon<br />as you come out the door, all right?
4821699 4822787 Let's go.
4827966 4830142 How long do you think it will<br />be before I can come back?
4832405 4834668 At least a year, Mike.
4834712 4839020 Listen, I'll square it with Mom, that you're<br />not seeing her before you leave and...
4840848 4842720 I'll get a message<br />to that girlfriend
4842763 4844330 when I think<br />the time is right.
4850945 4852251 Take care, huh?
4854993 4856734 Take care, Mike.
4889462 4891595 I'm glad you came, Mike.
4891638 4894467 I hope we can<br />straighten everything out.
4894511 4897862 I mean, this is terrible. It's not<br />the way I wanted things to go at all.
4897905 4899690 It should never<br />have happened.
4899733 4901605 I want to straighten<br />everything out.
4901648 4904085 I don't want my father<br />bothered anymore.
4904129 4908350 He won't be, Mike. I swear on<br />my children that he won't be.
4908394 4911789 But you got to keep an<br />open mind when we talk.
4911832 4914269 I mean, I hope you're not a<br />hothead like your brother Sonny.
4914313 4916184 You can't talk<br />business with him.

5189501 5192547 I missed my chance.<br />You think too much of me, kid.
5193244 5194506 I'm not that clever.
5196551 5198640 All I want is a truce.

7499548 7501202 Get the car.
7502420 7505119 Are you driving<br />yourself, boss? Yes.
7505162 7507251 Is your wife<br />coming with you?
7507295 7510036 No, I want you to take her to her father's<br />house until I know things are safe.
7510080 7511908 Okay, anything<br />you say, boss.
7516956 7518262 [BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN]
7518306 7520830 Calo, where is Apollonia?
7520873 7524225 She's going to surprise you.<br />She wants to drive.
7526618 7530056 She'll make a good<br />American wife.
7530100 7532581 Wait. I'll get the baggage.
7542373 7543505 Fabrizio!
7545115 7546856 Where are you going?
7546899 7548510 [CAR HONKING]<br />[APOLLONIA SPEAKS ITALAIN]
7548553 7550512 I'll drive you.<br />Wait there
7556866 7558389 No! No, Apollonia!
7581543 7583545 VITO: Don Barzini,<br />I want to thank you
7583588 7587505 for helping me organize<br />this meeting in a day,
7587549 7592293 and the other heads of the five<br />families from New York and New Jersey.
7594077 7597254 Carmine Cuneo<br />from the Bronx,
7597298 7600692 and from Brooklyn
7602346 7604392 Philip Tattaglia.
7606045 7609005 And from Staten Island
7609048 7612574 we have with us<br />Victor Strachi.
7612617 7618275 And the other associates that came as<br />far as from California and Kansas City
7618319 7622018 and all the other territories<br />of the country. Thank you.
7628764 7630940 How did things<br />ever get so far?
7632289 7633899 I don't know.
7635988 7639427 It was so unfortunate,<br />so unnecessary.
7642604 7646172 Tattaglia lost a son,<br />and I lost a son.
7648479 7652004 We're quits.<br />And if Tattaglia agrees,
7652048 7657445 then I'm willing to let things<br />go on the way they were before.
7657488 7661187 We're all grateful to Don<br />Corleone for calling this meeting.
7661231 7663886 We all know him<br />as a man of his word.
7663929 7666454 A modest man who<br />always listens to reason.
7666497 7670849 Yes, Don Barzini.<br />He's too modest.
7670893 7673852 He had all the judges and<br />politicians in his pocket.
7675114 7678074 He refused to share them.
7678117 7681904 When did I ever refuse<br />an accommodation?
7681947 7683819 All of you know me here.
7685299 7690391 When did I ever refuse,<br />except one time? And why?
7692088 7693655 Because I believe
7693698 7697920 this drug business is gonna<br />destroy us in the years to come.
7697963 7702403 I mean, it's not like gambling<br />or liquor or even women,
7702446 7704753 which is something that<br />most people want nowadays,
7704796 7708409 but is forbidden to them by<br />the pezzonovante of the Church.
7708452 7710149 Even the police departments
7710193 7713196 that have helped us in the past<br />with gambling and other things
7713239 7714502 are going to refuse to help us
7714545 7717592 when it comes to narcotics.
7717635 7722814 And I believed that then<br />and I believe that now.
7722858 7725034 Times have changed.
7725077 7729952 It's not like the old days,<br />when we can do anything we want.
7729995 7732824 A refusal is not<br />the act of a friend.
7732868 7736828 If Don Corleone had all the judges<br />and politicians in New York,
7736872 7738700 then he must share them
7738743 7743966 or let others use them. He must let<br />us draw the water from the well.
7744009 7747622 Certainly he can present<br />a bill for such services.
7747665 7750581 After all,<br />we're not communists.
7750625 7753323 [ALL LAUGH]
7753367 7756587 I also don't believe<br />in drugs.
7756631 7758850 For years I paid<br />my people extra,
7758894 7761505 so they wouldn't<br />do that kind of business.
7761549 7764682 Somebody says to them<br />and says, "I have powders.
7764726 7768338 "If you put up<br />3-4,000 dollar investment,
7768382 7770949 "we can make<br />50,000 distributing."
7772255 7773909 So they can't resist.
7773952 7778261 I want to control it as a<br />business, to keep it respectable.
7778304 7780437 I don't want it<br />near schools,
7780481 7782396 I don't want it<br />sold to children.
7783135 7786225 That's an infamia.
7786269 7790316 In my city we would keep the traffic<br />and the dark people, the colored.
7790360 7793232 They're animals anyway,<br />so let them lose their souls.
7800152 7803678 I hoped that we could come<br />here and reason together.
7805114 7806550 And as a reasonable man,
7806594 7808596 I'm willing to do<br />whatever is necessary
7808639 7812295 to find a peaceful solution<br />to this problem.
7812338 7814340 Then we are agreed.
7814384 7816821 The traffic in drugs will be<br />permitted, but controlled.
7816865 7821347 And Don Corleone will give us protection<br />in the east, and there will be the peace.
7821391 7825177 But I must have strict<br />assurance from Corleone.
7825221 7828529 As time goes by and his<br />position becomes stronger,
7828572 7831314 will he attempt<br />any individual vendetta?
7831357 7833055 BARZINI: Look, we are all<br />reasonable men here.
7833098 7836493 We don't have to give<br />assurances as if we were lawyers.
7836537 7839453 You talk about<br />vengeance.
7839496 7842194 Is vengeance gonna<br />bring your son back to you?
7842847 7844370 Or my boy to me?
7845546 7847852 I forgo the vengeance<br />of my son.
7851116 7853031 But I have<br />selfish reasons.
7855773 7859255 My youngest son was forced<br />to leave this country
7861170 7863389 because of this<br />Sollozzo business.
7863955 7865566 All right.
7865609 7869265 And I have to make arrangements<br />to bring him back here safely.
7869308 7871485 Cleared of all these<br />false charges.
7873356 7875314 But I'm<br />a superstitious man.
7876664 7879144 And if some unlucky accident<br />should befall him,
7879188 7881886 if he should get shot in the<br />head by a police officer,
7883322 7886935 or if he should hang himself<br />in his jail cell,
7886978 7889503 or if he's struck<br />by a bolt of lightning,
7891113 7894159 then I'm going to blame some<br />of the people in this room.
7896248 7898120 And that I do not forgive.
7901210 7903560 But, that aside
7906694 7908609 let me say that I swear
7910654 7913875 on the souls<br />of my grandchildren,
7913918 7917313 that I will not be the one to break<br />the peace we've made here today.
7943774 7945776 When I meet<br />with the Tattaglia people,
7945820 7949258 Should I insist that all his drug<br />middlemen have clean records?
7949301 7951086 Mention it.<br />Don't insist.
7953436 7956004 Barzini is a man who will<br />know that without being told.
7957179 7958310 You mean Tattaglia.
7959921 7961618 Tattaglia's a pimp.
7963054 7965230 He could never<br />have outfought Santino.
7968582 7970409 But I didn't know<br />until this day
7970453 7974152 that it was Barzini<br />all along..
7989472 7990865 Come on, Nancy.
7992910 7995391 Keep together,<br />everyone. Brian.
7996871 7998263 Okay, all right.
8011581 8013278 How long<br />have you been back?
8014584 8015803 I've been back a year.
8017935 8018936 Longer than that, I think.
8022766 8024072 It's good to see you, Kay.
8030992 8033342 Hi, Ms. Adams.<br />[CYCLE BELL TRILLS]
8033908 8035910 [DOG BARKING]
8035953 8037738 I'm working for<br />my father now, Kay.
8041002 8043961 He's been sick.<br />Very sick.
8045528 8047530 But you're not<br />like him, Michael.
8047573 8050315 I thought you weren't going to<br />become a man like your father.
8050359 8051577 That's what you told me.
8053318 8056060 My father is no different<br />than any other powerful man.
8056104 8057671 [SCOFFS]
8057714 8061109 Any man who's responsible<br />for other people.
8062371 8064808 Like a senator<br />or president.
8064852 8066114 You know<br />how naive you sound.
8066157 8067506 Why?
8067550 8069857 Senators and presidents<br />don't have men killed.
8071423 8073164 Oh.
8073208 8076559 Who's being naive, Kay?
8076602 8079867 Kay, my father's way of doing<br />things is over. It's finished.
8079910 8081216 Even he knows that.
8082347 8083914 I mean, in five years
8083958 8086395 the Corleone family is going<br />to be completely legitimate.
8088702 8092618 Trust me. That's all I can tell<br />you about my business. Kay...
8093968 8097145 Michael, why did<br />you come here? Why?
8097188 8099234 [SOBS]
8099277 8103325 What do you want with me after all this<br />time? I've been calling and writing.
8103368 8105370 I came because I need you.
8105414 8106850 Because I care for you.
8106894 8108156 Please stop it, Michael.
8108199 8110767 Because...<br />I want you to marry me.
8112464 8113639 It's too late.<br />It's too late.
8113683 8116773 Please, Kay...
8116817 8120734 I'll do anything you ask. Anything<br />to make up for what's happened to us.
8122561 8124912 Because<br />that's important, Kay.
8124955 8128219 Because what's<br />important is that
8128263 8131657 we have each other.<br />That we have a life together.
8133094 8134791 That we have children.
8134835 8136053 Our children.
8137315 8139578 Kay, I need you.
8141450 8143060 And I love you.
8165517 8169130 TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel my<br />territory and we do nothing about it!
8169173 8171523 Pretty soon I there won't be one<br />place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat!
8171567 8173482 MICHAEL: Just be patient.
8173525 8175963 TESSIO: I'm not asking you for help,<br />Mike Just take off the handcuffs.
8176006 8177268 MICHAEL: Be patient.
8177312 8179227 CARLO: We got to<br />protect ourselves.
8179270 8181229 Give me a chance<br />to recruit some new men.
8181272 8182926 MICHAEL: No.
8182970 8185581 I don't want to give Barzini<br />an excuse to start fighting.
8185624 8187322 TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.
8188149 8190455 CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...
8190499 8192153 You once said that<br />the day would come
8192196 8194633 when Tessio and me<br />could form our own family.
8194677 8196592 Till today<br />I would never think of it.
8196635 8198376 I must ask<br />your permission.
8199769 8202511 Michael is now<br />head of the family
8202554 8205470 and if he gives his permission,<br />then you have my blessing.
8206907 8209344 After we make<br />the move to Nevada
8209387 8212477 you can break off from the<br />Corleone family and go on your own.
8212521 8213783 After we make<br />the move to Nevada.
8213827 8215089 TESSIO:<br />How long will that be?
8216830 8218135 Six months.
8218179 8221573 Forgive me, Godfather,<br />but with you gone,
8221617 8224576 me and Pete will come under<br />Barzini's thumb sooner or later.
8224620 8226796 And I hate that<br />goddamn Barzini.
8226840 8230234 In six months' time there will<br />be nothing left to build on.
8230278 8232062 Do you have faith<br />in my judgment?
8232106 8233237 Yes.
8233281 8234760 Do I have your loyalty?
8234804 8236240 Yes, always, Godfather.
8236284 8237807 Then be a friend to Michael.
8238373 8239722 Do as he says.
8244466 8246294 There are things<br />being negotiated now
8246337 8249819 that are gonna solve all your problems<br />and answer all your questions.
8249863 8251386 That's all<br />I can tell you now.
8253040 8255694 Carlo, you grew up<br />in Nevada.
8255738 8258001 When we make our move there,<br />you'll be my right-hand man.
8259220 8260656 Tom Hagen<br />is no longer consigliere.
8261700 8264051 He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
8264094 8266662 That's no reflection on Tom,<br />just how I want it.
8266705 8268620 Besides, if I ever need help,
8268664 8270622 who's a better consigliere<br />than my father?
8270666 8271928 Well, that's it.
8291426 8292514 Thank you, Papa.
8292557 8293950 I'm happy<br />for you, Carlo.
8295430 8298215 Mike... Why am I out?
8299782 8301871 You're not<br />a wartime consigliere, Tom.
8303786 8306354 Things may get rough<br />with the move we're trying.
8307007 8308095 Tom.
8313491 8315929 I advised Michael.
8315972 8318844 I never thought<br />you were a bad consigliere.
8318888 8322979 I thought Santino was a bad<br />Don, rest in peace.
8324415 8328637 Michael has all my<br />confidence, just as you do.
8328680 8333642 But there are reasons why you must have<br />no part in what is going to happen.
8334686 8336340 Maybe I could help.
8336384 8337689 You're out, Tom.
8347873 8349353 [DOOR CLOSING]
8386869 8389698 I can't get over the way<br />your face looks.
8389741 8391265 It really looks good!
8391308 8393789 This doctor did some job.<br />Who talked you into it?
8393832 8395921 Kay? Hey, hey, hey!<br />Wait. Hey, hey.
8395965 8397880 Leave them out here.<br />We'll deal with them later.
8397923 8400230 He's tired and wants<br />to clean up. All right now.
8400274 8401623 Let me open the door,<br />all right?

8462945 8464816 I'm sorry.<br />Sorry... Sorry.

8480441 8483313 He said to give him a call<br />when the party started.
8483357 8485228 Well, give him a call.<br />[PATS ON BACK]
8486664 8488057 Johnny, how are you?

8491060 8492192 JOHNNY: Thanks, Mike.
8492235 8494498 Sit down, Johnny,<br />I want to talk to you.
8494542 8495847 The Don is proud<br />too, Johnny.
8495891 8499024 Well, I owe it<br />all to him.
8499068 8501026 Well, he knows<br />how grateful you are.
8501070 8504204 That's why he'd like<br />to ask a favor of you.
8504247 8505640 Mike, what can I do?
8507468 8509948 The Corleone family is thinking<br />of giving up all its interests
8509992 8513604 in the olive oil business<br />and settling out here.
8513648 8516346 Now Moe Greene will sell<br />us his share of the casino
8516390 8519132 and the hotel, so it could<br />completely be owned by the family.
8519175 8521960 Tom! Hey, Mike,<br />are you sure about that?
8522004 8524963 Moe loves the business. He never<br />said nothing to me about selling.
8525007 8527140 Yeah, I'll make him an offer<br />he can't refuse.
8528967 8530230 See, Johnny...
8531492 8533146 See, we figure<br />that entertainment
8533189 8535800 will be a big factor in<br />drawing gamblers to the casino.
8535844 8537498 And we hope<br />you'll sign a contract
8537541 8539282 to appear<br />five times a year.
8542546 8547160 Perhaps convince some of your<br />friends in the movies to do the same.
8548378 8549640 We're counting on you.
8552556 8555168 Sure, Mike.<br />I'll do anything for my godfather.
8555211 8557082 You know that.<br />Good.
8559259 8563872 Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.<br />Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
8563915 8565265 Good to see you, Mike.
8565308 8566570 How are you, Moe?<br />All right.
8566614 8567658 Did you get<br />everything you want?
8567702 8569269 The chef cooked<br />for you special,
8569312 8571793 the dancers will kick your tongue<br />out and you credit is good!
8571836 8574317 Draw chips for everybody in the<br />room so they can play on the house.
8578103 8579714 My credit good enough<br />to buy you out?
8579757 8581759 [LAUGHING]
8582499 8583674 Buy me out?
8584458 8587112 The casino, the hotel.
8587156 8590115 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy you out.
8590159 8592988 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy me out?
8593031 8595599 No, I buy you out.<br />You don't buy me out.
8595643 8599124 Your casino loses money.<br />Maybe we can do better.
8599168 8600604 You think I'm skimming<br />off the top, Mike?
8602302 8603346 You're unlucky.
8605000 8607785 [CHUCKLING]
8607829 8610353 You goddamn Guineas<br />really make me laugh.
8610397 8612094 I do you a favor<br />and take Freddy in
8612137 8613487 when you're having<br />a bad time,
8613530 8616316 and now you try<br />to push me out! Wait a minute.
8616359 8619884 You took Freddy in because the<br />Corleone family bankrolled your Casino,
8619928 8623236 because the Molinari family on<br />the coast guaranteed his safety.
8623279 8625194 Now we're talking business.<br />Let's talk business.
8625238 8626674 Yeah, let's talk<br />business, Mike.
8626717 8628371 First of all,<br />you're all done.
8628415 8630678 The Corleone family don't have<br />that kind of muscle anymore.
8630721 8632680 The Godfather is sick, right?
8632723 8635073 You're getting chased out of New York<br />by Barzini and the other families.
8635117 8636553 What do you think is going on?
8636597 8639164 You think you can come to<br />my hotel and take over?
8639208 8644169 I talked to Barzini. I can make a<br />deal with him and still keep my hotel!
8644213 8647782 Is that why you slapped my<br />brother around in public?
8647825 8652569 Ah, that was nothing, Mike.<br />Now, Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
8652613 8655050 Sure he flies off the handle<br />once in a while,
8655093 8657052 but Moe and me we're good<br />friends, right Moe, huh?
8657095 8659054 I've got a business to run.
8659097 8661883 I've got to kick asses<br />sometimes to make it run right.
8661926 8663319 We had a little argument,<br />Freddy and I,
8663363 8664755 so I had<br />to straighten him out.
8665930 8667280 You straightened<br />my brother out?
8668629 8671371 He was banging cocktail<br />waitresses two at a time!
8671414 8674112 Players couldn't get a drink at<br />the table. What's wrong with you?
8680162 8683731 I leave for New York tomorrow.<br />Think about a price.
8683774 8685776 [DRINK SPILLING]<br />MOE: Son of a bitch!
8685820 8688692 Do you know who I am?<br />I'm Moe Greene!
8688736 8691129 I made my bones when you were<br />going out with cheerleaders.
8691173 8693393 Wait a minute, Moe.<br />I got an idea.
8694698 8696918 Tom, Tom,<br />you're the consigliere.
8696961 8698311 You can talk to the Don...<br />You can explain...
8698354 8700225 Just a minute now.
8700269 8703707 Don is semi-retired and Mike is in<br />charge of the family business now.
8703751 8706536 If you have anything to<br />say, say it to Michael.
8710497 8712542 [DOOR SLAMMING]
8712586 8715937 Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and<br />talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
8717678 8718809 Fredo...
8720158 8722552 You're my older brother,<br />and I love you.
8724380 8727775 But don't ever take sides with<br />anyone against the family again.
8729820 8730908 Ever.
8739090 8742050 I have to see my father and his<br />people, so have dinner without me.
8742093 8743443 Oh, Michael.
8744966 8746924 This weekend we'll go out.<br />Mmm.
8746968 8749579 We'll go to the city, we'll see a<br />show and we'll have dinner. I promise.
8750101 8751146 Mmm.
8757239 8760242 Oh, Michael., Michael,<br />your sister wants to ask you something.
8760285 8761374 Let her ask.
8761417 8762940 No, she's afraid to.
8762984 8765552 Connie and Carlo want you to<br />be godfather to their boy.
8765595 8767467 We'll see.<br />Will you?
8767510 8769338 Let me think about it.<br />We'll see. Come on.
8776519 8777520 So...
8778608 8781655 Barzini will move<br />against you first.
8781698 8785006 He'll set up a meeting with<br />someone that you absolutely trust.
8786137 8787791 Guaranteeing your safety.
8789358 8791969 And at that meeting<br />you'll be assassinated.
8797322 8799803 I like to drink wine<br />more than I used to.
8801631 8803894 Anyway,<br />I'm drinking more.
8803938 8805330 It's good for you, Pop.
8810335 8811380 I don't know.
8813774 8815602 Your wife and children,<br />are you happy with them?
8817517 8818605 Very happy.
8819519 8822304 That's good.
8822347 8827265 I hope you don't mind the way I keep<br />going over this Barzini business.
8827309 8829224 No, not at all.
8829267 8831705 It's an old habit.
8831748 8834229 I spend my life trying<br />not to be careless.
8836231 8839234 Women and children can be<br />careless, but not men.
8842542 8843760 How's your boy?
8844326 8845501 He's good.
8845545 8847677 You know, he looks<br />more like you every day.
8850985 8853466 He's smarter than I am.
8853509 8855250 Three years old and he can<br />read the funny papers.
8857513 8859123 Read the funny papers.
8864738 8866653 Uh...
8866696 8869351 I want you to arrange<br />to have a telephone man
8869394 8872572 check all the calls that go<br />in and out of here...
8872615 8875879 I did it already, Pop.<br />I took care of that. It could be anyone.
8875923 8877838 Oh, that's right. I forgot.
8881885 8883147 What's the matter?
8884540 8885846 What's bothering you?
8890067 8892461 I'll handle it.
8892505 8894507 I told you I can handle it,<br />I'll handle it.
8908042 8911175 I knew that Santino was gonna<br />have to go through all this.
8912525 8914265 And Fredo...
8914309 8915615 Well...
8916877 8918531 Fredo was, well...
8920837 8923623 But I never...<br />I never wanted this for you.
8925973 8927365 I worked my whole life.
8927409 8931065 I don't apologize<br />for take care of my family.
8931108 8935069 And I refused<br />to be a fool,
8935112 8939203 dancing on a string held<br />by all those big shots.
8941249 8944295 I don't apologize.<br />That's my life, but I thought that...
8946341 8948996 That when it was<br />your time,
8949039 8951520 that you would be<br />the one to hold the strings.
8953304 8959049 Senator Corleone.<br />Governor Corleone. Something.
8959093 8960529 Another pezzonovante.
8962096 8963358 Well...
8965447 8967101 [SIGHS]
8967144 8971018 Just wasn't enough time, Michael.<br />Wasn't enough time.
8971061 8974543 We'll get there, Pop.<br />We'll get there.
8975588 8976719 Hmm.
8979417 8983900 Now listen, whoever comes to<br />you with this Barzini meeting,
8983944 8986816 he's the traitor.<br />Don't forget that.
9004007 9006096 Can I hold it, please?
9021242 9022939 Can I water these?
9022983 9025159 Yes, go ahead.
9025202 9027944 Over here, over here.
9029859 9032340 Be careful.<br />You're spilling it.

9283852 9285593 Mike, can I<br />have a minute?
9296386 9298780 Barzini wants to<br />arrange a meeting.
9298823 9302001 He says we can straighten<br />out any of our problems.
9302697 9303785 You talked to him?
9303828 9304917 Yeah.
9306309 9310009 I can arrange security.<br />On my territory.
9313142 9315101 All right?
9315144 9317973 All right.
9333249 9335599 Do you know how they're<br />going to come at you?
9338820 9342432 They're arranging a meeting<br />in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
9344608 9346349 Where I'll be safe.
9358666 9362365 I always thought it would have<br />been Clemenza, not Tessio.
9362409 9366108 It's the smart move.<br />Tessio was always smarter.
9368371 9369633 But I'm going to wait.
9370895 9372419 After the baptism.
9375248 9378860 I've decided to be<br />godfather to Connie's baby.
9378903 9383212 And then I'll meet with<br />Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

9788400 9790837 Hell, he can't do that.<br />It screws up all my arrangements.
9790880 9792142 Oh, that's what he said.
9792186 9793535 I can't go either, Sal.
9806026 9810030 Tell Mike it was only business.<br />I always liked him.
9811727 9812859 He understands that.

9880622 9882189 Mike, you got it<br />all wrong.
9882232 9885627 You fingered Sonny<br />for Barzini.
9885671 9889370 That little farce you<br />played with my sister.
9889413 9891285 You think that could fool<br />a Corleone?
9891328 9894723 Mike, I'm innocent.<br />I swear on the kids, Mike.
9894767 9896682 Please, Mike, don't do this.<br />Sit down.

9927103 9928888 Today I settle<br />all family business,
9928931 9932456 so don't tell me<br />you're innocent, Carlo.
9932500 9934502 Admit what you did.
9938114 9939855 Get him a drink.
9946122 9947428 Come on.
9948777 9951258 Don't be afraid, Carlo.
9951301 9955088 Come on. Do you think I'd<br />make my sister a widow?
9955131 9957873 I'm godfather<br />to your son, Carlo.
9964793 9966795 Go ahead, drink, drink.
9971800 9976675 No, Carlo, you're out of the family<br />business. That's your punishment.

9990384 9993996 Only don't tell me<br />you're innocent.

10002570 10004616 Who approached you?
10005704 10008097 Tattaglia or Barzini?
10016018 10017672 It was Barzini.
10021850 10023417 Good.
10029684 10033775 There's a car waiting outside<br />to take you to the airport.

10155070 10159205 You waited until Papa died, so nobody<br />could stop you and then you killed him.
