76820 79660 <i>I believe in America.</i>
79740 82200 America has made my fortune.
82790 86620 And I raised my daughter<br />in the American fashion.
87000 91440 I gave her freedom, but I taught<br />her never to dishonor her family.
93300 96420 She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.
96510 100930 She went to the movies with him.<br />She stayed out late.
101010 102720 I didn't protest.
103810 108520 Two months ago, he took her for<br />a drive with another boyfriend.
109560 112190 They made her drink whiskey
112270 116650 and then they tried to<br />take advantage of her.
116740 120870 She resisted, she kept her honor.
122200 125200 So they beat her like an animal.
127040 132000 When I went to the hospital,<br />her nose was broken,
132090 136550 her jaw was shattered,<br />held together by wire.
138760 142180 She couldn't even weep<br />because of the pain.
144220 147730 But I wept. Why did I weep?
150400 152730 She was the light of my life.
154690 156400 Beautiful girl.
160070 163030 Now she will never be beautiful again.
169580 170960 Sorry.
179260 183930 I went to the police,<br />like a good American.
184010 186680 These two boys were brought to trial.
187770 190560 The judge sentenced them<br />to three years in prison,
190640 192770 but suspended the sentence.
193940 198940 Suspended the sentence!<br />They went free that very day!
201240 204530 I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
204620 208120 Those two bastards, they smiled at me.
209370 214960 Then I said to my wife, "For justice,<br />we must go to Don Corleone."
220380 224760 Why did you go to the police?<br />Why didn't you come to me first?
224890 230980 What do you want of me? Tell me<br />anything, but do what I beg you to do.
231060 232730 What is that?
243860 245700 I want them dead.
257340 259130 That I cannot do.
260460 262970 I'll give you anything you ask.
265260 266990 We've known each other<br />many years, but this
267014 270314 is the first time you ever came<br />to me for counsel for help.
272060 273910 I can't remember the last time that
273934 276734 you invited to your house<br />for a cup of coffee.
278270 281630 Even though my wife is<br />godmother to your only child.
282110 286620 But let's be frank here.<br />You never wanted my friendship.
287525 290875 And you were afraid<br />to be in my debt.
291040 293350 I didn't want to get into trouble.
294580 296110 I understand.
297710 300290 You found Paradise in America.
302715 304685 Had a good trade, made a good living,
304779 307379 the police protected you, and<br />there were courts of law.
307640 310150 You didn't need a friend like me.
311890 315560 But now you come to me and say,
315640 318060 "Don Corleone, give me justice."
319980 322820 But you don't ask with respect.
322900 325210 You don't offer friendship.
325234 327734 You don't even think<br />to call me Godfather.
329320 332610 Instead, you come into my house on<br />the day my daughter is to be married
332634 335034 and you ask me to do<br />murder for money.
336290 338730 I ask you for justice.
338920 341720 That is not justice.<br />Your daughter is still alive.
342960 346020 Let them suffer then, as she suffers.
348550 350650 How much shall I pay you?
365530 369450 Bonasera, Bonasera.
369530 373320 What have I ever done to make<br />you treat me so disrespectfully?
374740 377290 If you'd come to me in friendship,
377370 381790 then the scum that ruined your daughter<br />would be suffering this very day.
382920 385490 And if by chance an honest man<br />like yourself should make enemies,
385544 387844 then they'd become my enemies.
391010 393350 And then they would fear you.
397350 399480 Be my friend?
403440 404980 Godfather?
409320 410530 Good.
412660 417730 Some day, and that day may never come,<br />I'll call upon you to do a service for you.
419210 421330 But until that day
423130 427420 accept this justice as a gift<br />on my daughter's wedding day.
427510 429920 Gr√†zie, Godfather.<br />Prego.
436970 439680 Give this to Clemenza.
441980 445440 I want reliable people; peoaple<br />that aren't gonna be carried away.
445520 449690 We're not murderers, in spite<br />of what this undertaker says.
474970 477890 Where is Michael?<br />Don't worry, it is early.
479520 482200 We're not taking the<br />picture without Michael.
488940 491200 What's the matter?<br />It's Michael.
541080 542750 Don Barzini.
559050 562430 Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.
562520 564770 Paulie! More wine.
565266 566735 Scusi, please!
566765 570085 You look terrific on the floor.<br />Are you a dance judge or something?
570136 571649 We have other guys to doi it.
571900 574450 Sandra, come do me a favor. Watch<br />the kids! Don't them run wild. All right?
581910 585160 Sandra, watch the kids.<br />Don't let them run wild.
585250 587710 You watch yourself, all right?
608850 613110 20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.
614070 616440 In that little silk purse.
616530 619810 Moron, if this were somebody<br />else's wedding...
620200 621450 Hey, Paulie!
621530 625330 I got two gabagool, capocol,<br />and a prosciut.
625410 626560 Stupid jerk!
635630 637550 What's the matter?
649810 652200 Have to go back to work.<br />Tom.
652265 653315 It is part of the wedding.
653364 656464 No Sicilian can refuse any request<br />on his daughter's wedding day.
662450 667480 Don Corleone, I'm honored and grateful<br />that you have invited me to your home.
672165 675475 What? Get out of here!<br />It's a private party. Go on!
676710 679670 What is it? It's my sister's wedding.
686260 688970 Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!
691980 695360 Come here, come here!
709620 714170 ...but towards the end, he was paroled<br />to help with the American war effort,
714250 717240 so for the last six months he's<br />been working in my pastry shop.
717420 720170 Nazorine, my friend,<br />what can I do for you?
720260 722220 Now that the war is over,
722300 726300 this boy, Enzo, they want to<br />repatriate him back to Italy.
726390 728470 Godfather, I have a daughter.
728939 730939 You see, she and Enzo...
732480 736980 You want Enzo to stay in this country,<br />and you want your daughter to be married.
738150 740240 You understand everything.
741280 743650 Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
746780 749350 Wait till you see the beautiful wedding<br />cake I made for your daughter!
749449 750704 Like this.
750830 753580 The bride, the groom and the angel...
758840 762880 Who should I give this job to?<br />Not to our paisan.
763470 766600 Give it to a Jew Congressman<br />in another district.
767224 769024 Who else is on the list?
775640 777230 Hey, Michael!
797040 800500 He is not on the list,<br />but Luca Brasi wants to see you.
806340 808720 Is this necessary?
808800 812830 He didn't expect to be invited to the<br />wedding, so he wanted to thank you.
814770 820090 Don Corleone, I'm honored and grateful<br />that you have invited me to your home
820270 822910 on the wedding day of your daughter.
823190 825610 May their first child<br />be a masculine child.
826820 828040 Michael...
830030 833110 That man over there<br />is talking to himself.
833490 835730 See that scary guy over there?
836410 837920 He is a very scary guy.
838044 839799 Who is he? What's his name?
840000 842070 His name is Luca Brasi.
842594 844794 He helps my father out sometimes.
846470 848990 Michael, wait a minute.<br />He is coming over here!
853720 855560 You look terrific!
855640 857840 My brother Tom Hagen,<br />This is Kay Adams.
857939 859439 How do you do?
860690 862740 Your father's been asking for you.
863020 865060 Very nice to meet you.<br />Nice to meet you.
867610 870020 If he is your brother, why does<br />he have a different name?
870450 873990 When my brother Sonny was a kid,<br />he found Tom Hagen in the street.
874370 877990 And he had no home,<br />so my father took him in.
880040 882330 He's been with us ever since.
883210 885070 He is a good lawyer.
886010 889590 Not a Sicilian. I think<br />he is going to be consigliere.
890680 893600 What's that?<br />That's a...
893680 896670 like a counselor, an advisor.<br />Very important to the family.
898480 900440 You like your lasagna?
904900 907110 Don Corleone.
907190 909860 I'm honored and grateful
909950 913780 that you have invited me<br />to your daughter's wedding.
918790 921680 On the day of your daughter's wedding.
922170 926500 And I hope that their first<br />child be a masculine child.
928420 933550 I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.
935510 940740 For your daughter's bridal purse.<br />Thank you, Luca. My most valued friend.
941020 946150 Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you<br />now, because I know you're busy.
946690 948030 Thank you.
997530 999870 Signora Corleone!
1001080 1003910 No!
1073030 1077610 Senator Cauley apologized for not coming<br />personally, but said you'd understand.
1078200 1080150 Also some of the judges.
1080474 1082374 They've all sent gifts.
1085500 1086710 What is that outside?
1095800 1100340 Johnny! Johnny!
1101390 1103060 I love you!
1113360 1115280 He came all the way from<br />California to come to the wedding.
1115304 1116859 I told you he was going to come!
1116860 1118960 Been two years. He is<br />probably in trouble again.
1119059 1120744 He is a good godson.
1121370 1125700 Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!
1141495 1143915 Mike, you never told me<br />you knew Johnny Fontane!
1144220 1148310 Sure. You want to meet him?<br />Well, sure.
1148390 1150429 My father helped<br />him with his career.
1150689 1152255 He did?
1152310 1153460 How?
1155715 1158355 Let's listen to this song.<br />Michael...
1192100 1194270 Please, Michael. Tell me.
1197770 1202820 When Johnny was first starting out, he was<br />signed to this personal service contract
1202910 1205080 with a big bandleader.
1205910 1210120 And as his career got better and<br />better, he wanted to get out of it.
1211160 1213870 Now Johnny is my father's godson.
1213960 1216890 And my father went to see this bandleader.
1217380 1220560 He offered him $ 10,000<br />to let Johnny go,
1221340 1223690 but the bandleader said no.
1224180 1228860 So the next day my father went to see<br />him, only this time with Luca Brasi.
1231310 1233160 Within an hour,
1233640 1238450 he signed a release for a<br />certified check of $ 1,000.
1241150 1242910 How did he do that?
1243034 1245434 My father made him an<br />offer he couldn't refuse
1246780 1248260 What was that?
1248484 1250484 Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,
1251790 1255300 and father assured him that either<br />his brains or his signature
1255399 1257099 would be on the contract.
1262010 1263630 That's a true story.
1275060 1277730 That's my family, Kay.<br />It's not me.
1290240 1291990 Beautiful!
1324230 1326360 I'll take care of it.
1326450 1328320 Tom...
1328410 1332120 I want you to find Santino.<br />Tell him to come to the office.
1339370 1341340 How are you, Fredo?
1341364 1342419 Fredo!
1342420 1344610 My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.
1346090 1348380 Hi.<br />How are you doing?
1350340 1354250 This is my brother Mike.<br />Are you having a good time?
1354930 1357120 Yeah. This is your friend?
1357600 1362270 I don't know what to do.<br />My voice is weak. It's weak.
1363980 1367450 Anyway, if I had this part<br />in the picture, you know
1367474 1369974 it puts me right back on top again.
1370530 1372170 But this...
1372479 1375779 this man out there he won't give<br />it to me, the head of the studio.
1375950 1379210 What's his name?<br />Woltz.
1379290 1382660 He won't give it to me, and<br />he says there is no chance.
1382699 1383799 No chance.
1387710 1388810 Sonny?
1390630 1391700 Sonny?
1398230 1399280 Sonny?
1400310 1402760 Sonny, are you in there?<br />What?
1403150 1404920 Your old man wants to see you.
1406270 1407980 Yeah, one minute.
1412859 1413959 Sonny?
1422420 1427460 A month ago he bought the movie<br />rights to this book, a best-seller.
1427550 1431130 The main character<br />is a guy just like me.
1431220 1433690 I wouldn't even have to<br />act...  just be myself.
1434850 1437680 Godfather, I don't know what to do.
1438970 1442770 You can act like a man!<br />What's the matter with you?
1443350 1447970 Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood<br />finocchio that cries like a woman?
1449150 1453200 "What can I do? What can I do?"<br />What is that nonsense?
1453280 1454690 Ridiculous.
1459700 1462630 You spend time with your family?<br />Sure I do.
1462910 1464240 Good.
1464580 1469000 Because a man who doesn't spend time<br />with his family can never be a real man.
1474930 1478090 You look terrible.<br />I want you to eat.
1478470 1480570 I want you to rest a while,<br />and in a month from now this
1480594 1483494 Hollywood big shot is gonna<br />give you what you want.
1483850 1486880 It's too late, they start<br />shooting in a week.
1487060 1489730 I'm gonna make him an<br />offer he can't refuse.
1493070 1495870 Just go outside and<br />enjoy yourself, and
1495894 1497794 forget about all this nonsense.
1500240 1503290 I want you to leave it all to me.<br />All right.
1528360 1530750 What time does my daughter<br />leave with the bridegroom?
1530774 1533174 In a few minutes, right<br />after they cut the cake.
1533740 1537260 Now your new son-in-law;<br />give him something important?
1537450 1538590 Never.
1538614 1541714 Give him a living, but never discuss<br />the family business with him.
1542870 1545660 What else?<br />Virgil Sollozzo called.
1545790 1548010 Now we're gonna have to give<br />him a day sometime next week.
1548049 1550649 We'll discus him when you<br />come back from California.
1551590 1554610 When am I going to California?<br />Want you to go Tonight.
1554840 1560240 I want you to talk to this movie big shot<br />and settle this business for Johnny.
1561470 1565400 If there is nothing else, I'd like<br />to go to my daughter's wedding.
1567770 1570530 Carlo, we're going to take the picture.
1571770 1573370 Wait a minute.
1573650 1575940 No, Michael. Not me.
1580450 1583230 Okay, that's it. Just like that.<br />Now hold it!
1693480 1696650 You need a little more heat on that arc.<br />All right, start talking.
1696730 1700150 I was sent by a friend<br />of Johnny Fontane.
1700240 1703990 His friend is my client who'd give<br />his undying friendship to Mr. Woltz,
1704070 1706710 if Mr. Woltz would<br />grant us a small favor.
1706990 1708930 Woltz is listening.
1709410 1713500 Give Johnny the part in that war<br />film you're starting next week.
1719210 1724020 And what favor would your<br />friend grant Mr. Woltz?
1724300 1727850 You're gonna have some union problems.<br />My client could make them disappear.
1727930 1732020 Also one of your top stars has just<br />moved from marijuana to heroin.
1732100 1734300 Are you trying to muscle me?<br />Absolutely not.
1734384 1736439 Now listen to me, you<br />smooth talking son of a bitch!
1736480 1739070 Let me lay it on the line for you<br />and your boss, whoever his is.
1739150 1741150 Johnny Fontane will<br />never get that movie!
1741280 1745780 I don't care how many daigo Guinea wop<br />greaseballs gumbas come out of the woodwork!
1745860 1747100 I'm German-Irish.
1747199 1749699 Well, let me tell you something,<br />my Kraut-Mick friend.
1749780 1752460 I'm gonna make so much trouble for<br />you! You won't know what hit you
1752484 1754249 Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.<br />I have not threatened.
1754250 1757630 I know almost every big lawyer in<br />New York. Who the hell are you?
1757710 1761050 I have a special practice.<br />I handle one client.
1761340 1763540 Now you have my number.<br />I'll wait for your call.
1765090 1767850 By the way, I admire<br />your pictures very much.
1772850 1774350 Check him out.
1796870 1799420 It's really beautiful.<br />Look at this.
1799500 1801910 It used to decorate the palace of a king.
1801934 1803633 Yeah, very nice.
1804090 1806270 Why didn't you say you<br />work for Corleone, Tom?
1806590 1808600 I thought you were just<br />some cheap, two-bit hustler
1808659 1810859 Johnny was running in trying to bluff me.
1810890 1813020 I don't like to use his name<br />unless it is really necessary.
1813044 1814349 How is your drink, Tom?
1814350 1815410 Fine.
1815469 1817869 Come on over here with me. I wanna<br />show you something really beautiful.
1817890 1820080 You do appreciate beauty,<br />don't you?
1823440 1826490 There you are.<br />$600,000 on four hooves.
1826570 1830530 I bet a Russian Czars never paid<br />that kind of dough for a single horse.
1830620 1831860 Khartoum.
1832780 1833880 Khartoum.
1835620 1837600 I'm not gonna race him, though.
1837824 1839824 I'm gonna to put him out to stud.
1841580 1842830 Thanks, Tony.
1843920 1846140 Let's get something to eat.
1846920 1849440 Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
1850430 1854750 To the Italian people that's a very<br />religious, sacred, close relationship.
1854930 1857950 I respect that. Just tell him he<br />should ask me anything else.
1858940 1861070 But this is one favor I can't give him.
1861350 1864650 He never asks a second favor once<br />he's been refused the first. Understood?
1864770 1866510 You don't understand.
1867134 1869534 Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
1870990 1874660 That part is perfect for him.<br />It'll make him a big star.
1874780 1878770 I'm gonna run him out of the<br />business, and let me tell you why.
1880870 1885550 Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz<br />International's most valuable prot√©g√©s.
1885630 1887710 For five years, we<br />had her under training.
1887734 1890334 Singing lessons, acting lessons,<br />dancing lessons.
1890955 1894845 I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars<br />on her.I was gonna make her a big star.
1895810 1898100 And let me be even more frank.
1898680 1903690 Just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted<br />man. That it's not all dollars and cents.
1903770 1906800 She was beautiful. She was<br />young. She was innocent!
1907480 1912410 She was the greatest piece of ass I've<br />had and I've had'em all over the world.
1912990 1918620 Then Johnny Fontane comes along with<br />his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
1919200 1920810 And she runs off.
1922250 1926340 She threw it all away just<br />to make me look ridiculous!
1926420 1931490 And a man in my position can't afford<br />to be made to look ridiculous!
1931670 1933810 Now you get the hell out of here!
1934090 1938470 If that goombah tries any rough stuff,<br />you tell him I ain't no band leader.
1939770 1942670 Yeah, I heard that story.
1943600 1946210 Thank you for the dinner and<br />a very pleasant evening.
1947690 1950270 Maybe your car can<br />take me to the airport.
1950650 1954240 Mr. Corleone is a man who insists<br />on hearing bad news immediately.
2066930 2070360 You're not too tired, are you, Tom?<br />No, I slept on the plane.
2070940 2073230 I have the Sollozzo notes here.
2074110 2075360 Now...
2077320 2079910 Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
2080990 2082950 He is supposed to be<br />very good with a knife,
2083030 2087060 but only in matters of business or<br />some sort of reasonable complaint.
2087540 2089790 His business is narcotics.
2090880 2093950 He has fields in Turkey,<br />where they grow poppy.
2094340 2097670 In Sicily he has plants to<br />process them into heroin.
2098260 2101560 Now he needs cash, and he<br />needs protection from the police
2101840 2103770 for which he gives a piece of the action.
2103794 2105594 I couldn't find out how much.
2105890 2108300 The Tattaglia family is behind<br />him here in New York.
2108324 2110624 Now they have to be in it for something.
2112400 2116580 What about his prison record?<br />Two terms, one in Italy, one here.
2117070 2119420 He is known as a top narcotics man.
2119900 2121780 Santino, what do you think?
2122504 2124804 A lot of money in that white powder.
2126910 2128090 Tom?
2128370 2129440 Well, I say yes. There is
2129489 2132589 more money potential in narcotics<br />than anything else we're looking at.
2132630 2135080 If we don't get into it,<br />somebody else will.
2135104 2137304 Maybe one of the five families<br />or maybe all of them.
2137460 2141630 Now with the money they earn, they<br />can buy more police and political power.
2142010 2144100 Then they come after us.
2144220 2146530 Now we have the unions,<br />we have the gambling.
2146754 2148554 And they are the best things to have.
2148643 2150374 But narcotics is a thing of the future.
2150810 2153540 And if we don't get a piece of that<br />action, we risk everything we have.
2153549 2156049 I mean not now,<br />but ten years from now.
2160490 2161870 So?
2162009 2163909 What's your answer gonna be, Pop?
2168330 2170080 Bene, Don Corleone.
2172170 2174560 I need a man who has powerful friends.
2175590 2178000 I need a million dollars in cash.
2178380 2182420 I need, Don Corleone, those politicians<br />that you carry in your pocket,
2182444 2184444 like so many nickels and dimes.
2185680 2188880 What is the interest for my family?<br />30%.
2189770 2193130 In the first year your end should<br />be three, four million dollars.
2193810 2195610 And then it would go up.
2197020 2200240 And what is the interest<br />for the Tattaglia family?
2202450 2204080 My compliments.
2207950 2211170 I'll take care of the Tattaglia's,<br />out of my share.
2211450 2215050 So I receive 30% for finance,
2215830 2219170 political influence and legal protection.<br />That's what you are telling me?
2219250 2220860 That's right.
2222260 2226180 Why do you come to me?<br />Why do I deserve this generosity?
2226260 2231360 If you consider a million<br />dollars in cash just finance,
2231640 2233610 te salud Don Corleone.
2244320 2249580 I said that I would see you because<br />I heard you were a serious man
2249660 2251610 to be treated with respect.
2256580 2259680 But, I must say no to you.
2261050 2263580 And I'll give you my reason.
2263970 2266800 It's true, I have a lot<br />of friends in politics.
2268050 2272470 But they wouldn't be friendly very long if they<br />knew my business was drugs instead of gambling,
2272560 2277390 which they rule that as a harmless<br />vice, but drugs is a dirty business.
2278270 2283080 It makes no any difference to me what<br />a man does for a living. Understand.
2283360 2288110 But your business is...<br />a little dangerous.
2288700 2293120 If you're worried about security for your<br />million,the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
2293200 2295310 You're telling me that the<br />Tattaglias guarantee our invest...
2295334 2296934 Wait a minute!
2304010 2308500 I have a sentimental weakness for my<br />children, and I spoil them as you can see.
2308880 2312140 They talk when they should listen.<br />But anyway...
2312260 2317540 Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. And I wish<br />to congratulate you on your new business.
2317730 2320790 I know you do very well,<br />and good luck to you.
2321270 2324810 As best as your interests<br />don't conflict with mine.
2324834 2326234 Thank you.
2346760 2348370 Santino.
2348760 2350590 Come here.
2352930 2354650 What's the matter with you?
2354930 2359560 I think your brain is going soft from all that<br />comedy you're playing with that young girl.
2359640 2363370 Never tell anybody outside the<br />family what you're thinking again.
2365070 2366320 Go on.
2370280 2373120 Tom, what's this nonsense?
2373200 2376320 It's from Johnny...<br />starring in that new film.
2378950 2381540 Take it away.<br />Take it over there.
2382830 2384080 And...
2385420 2387590 tell Luca Brasi to come in.
2393720 2396840 I'm a little worried<br />about this Sollozzo fellow.
2397220 2400180 I want you to find out what he's<br />got under his fingernails.You know.
2401190 2403610 Go to the Tattaglias and...
2404900 2409190 make them think that you're<br />not too happy with our family
2410570 2412950 and find out what you can.
2430420 2433720 I got something for your<br />mother and for Sonny
2433800 2438470 and a tie for Freddy, and Tom<br />Hagen got the Reynolds pen.
2438560 2441610 What do you want for Christmas?<br />Me? Just you.
2473720 2475330 Andiamo, Fredo.
2475720 2478640 Tell Paulie to get the car.<br />Okay, Pop.
2479220 2482830 I'll have to get it myself.<br />Paulie called in sick this morning.
2484980 2487930 Paulie is a good kid.<br />I don't mind getting the car.
2491650 2493820 Buon natale, Caro. Gr√†zie.
2536450 2537640 Luca!
2538264 2540564 I'm Bruno Tattaglia.<br />I know.
2550670 2553090 You know who I am?<br />I know you.
2553919 2557065 You have been talking to the<br />Tattaglia family... right?
2558803 2562019 I think you and I can do...
2562839 2564143 business.
2564810 2567480 I could use someone<br />strong like you.
2568100 2570940 I heard you are not happy...
2571360 2573650 ...with the Corleone family.
2575791 2577224 Want to join me?
2577320 2579280 What's in it for me?
2580137 2584077 $50,000 to start with.
2586830 2588080 Not bad!
2589750 2591380 Agreed?
2650810 2654520 Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
2654650 2657170 Glad to run into you.<br />I want to talk to you.
2657594 2659394 I haven't got time.
2659650 2662700 Make time, Consigliere.<br />Get in the car.
2664530 2668640 What are you worried about? If I wanted<br />to kill you, you'd be dead already.
2669120 2670480 Get in.
2681590 2685300 Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.<br />Okay, Pop.
2692100 2694940 Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.
2782480 2784930 Mike, would you like me<br />better if I were a nun?
2785269 2786969 Like in a story, you know.
2789660 2790660 No.
2790740 2793604 Well then, would you like me<br />better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
2793630 2795145 Now, that's a thought.
2797710 2799170 Michael.
2799750 2802170 No, I wouldn't like you better<br />if you were Ingrid Bergman.
2802250 2803850 What's the matter?
2820940 2823210 They don't say if he is dead or alive.
2845880 2849170 Sonny, it's Michael.<br /><i>Where have you been?</i>
2849260 2852010 Is he all right?<br /><i>We don't know yet.</i>
2852090 2856140 <i>There are all kinds of stories.<br />He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>
2858100 2861150 <i>Are you there?</i><br />Yeah, I'm here.
2861480 2865860 <i>Where have you been? I was worried.</i><br />Didn't Tom tell you I called?
2866440 2869890 <i>No. Look, come home, kid.<br />You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>
2869929 2871229 All right.
2877950 2879340 Oh, my God.
2883540 2884760 Sonny!
2893840 2895540 Get back, go.
2896220 2898490 Who is it?<br />Open up, it's Clemenza.
2900140 2901240 What?
2901310 2903360 There is more news about your old man.
2904650 2906820 The word is out on the street<br />that he is already dead.
2906844 2909229 Watch your mouth!<br />What's the matter with you?
2909253 2911253 Take it easy!
2911320 2913170 Where was Paulie?<br />Paulie was out sick.
2913179 2914644 He's been calling sick all winter.
2914660 2917080 How many times has he been sick?<br />Only maybe three, four times. I mean...
2917160 2919550 I asked Freddy if he wants me to get<br />a different bodyguard. He said no.
2919574 2921039 Listen, do me a favor.<br />Pick him up right now.
2921040 2922980 I don't care how sick he is.<br />If he is breathing,
2923004 2925804 I want to bring him to my father's<br />house now. You understand? Now.
2925960 2927750 Yeah, you want me to<br />send any people over here?
2927774 2930074 No, no. Just you and him.<br />Go ahead. All right.
2936750 2937850 Look!
2938220 2941030 I'll be having a couple of people come<br />over to the house. A couple of our people
2945150 2947310 Hello?<br />Santino Corleone?
2947400 2950230 Yeah.<br />We have Tom Hagen.
2950320 2954030 In about three hours he'll be<br />released with our proposition.
2954110 2957450 Listen to everything he has to<br />say before you do anything.
2957530 2961760 What's done is done. And don't lose<br />that famous temper of yours, Sonny.
2962250 2963660 I'll wait.
2978300 2980010 Your boss is dead.
2983140 2985360 I know you're not in the<br />muscle end of the family, Tom.
2985399 2987599 So I don't want you to be scared.
2988650 2990830 I want you to help<br />the Corleones. .
2990854 2992754 And I want you to help me
2996490 3000490 Yeah, we got him outside his office just<br />about an hour after we picked you up.
3002410 3003700 Drink it.
3008460 3011620 So now it's up to you to make<br />peace between me and Sonny.
3016130 3018430 Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?
3020300 3022640 And you knew it was<br />the right thing to do.
3024310 3026740 Sonny will come after you<br />with everything he's got.
3027034 3029234 That will be his first reaction, sure.
3030860 3033160 That's why you gotta talk<br />some sense into him.
3033184 3036184 The Tattaglia family is behind<br />me with all that people.
3037450 3042430 The other New York families will go along with<br />anything that will prevent a full-scale war.
3042620 3047730 Let's face it, Tom. And all due respect,<br />the Don- rest in peace- was slipping.
3050830 3053840 Ten years ago,<br />could I have gotten to him?
3057720 3060880 Well, now he is dead, Tom.<br />And nothing can bring him back.
3063470 3067150 So you gotta talk to Sonny, you<br />gotta talk to the Caporegimes,
3067174 3069174 that Tessio and that fat Clemenza.
3074320 3076200 It's good business, Tom.
3077780 3079320 I'll try.
3079529 3082229 But even Sonny won't be<br />able to call off Luca Brasi.
3085660 3087450 Yeah, well...
3089290 3091670 Let me worry about Luca.
3096880 3099060 You just talk to Sonny.
3099340 3101590 And the other two kids.
3104550 3106860 I'll do my best.<br />Good.
3109430 3111650 Now you can go.
3118690 3122770 I don't like violence, Tom.<br />I'm a businessman.
3123450 3125610 Blood is a big expense.
3147140 3148920 He is still alive.
3149100 3152460 They hit him with five shots,<br />and he is still alive!
3153150 3157600 That's bad luck for me, and bad luck<br />for you if you don't make that deal.
3202610 3204650 Your mother is over at the<br />hospital with your father.
3204674 3207074 Looks like he is gonna pull<br />through, thanks God.
3209280 3215820 It's a lot of bad blood. It is too far.<br />Sollozzo,Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...
3216000 3218520 You kill all those guys?<br />Stay out of it, Mickey. Do me a favor.
3218544 3221599 Sollozzo is the key. You get rid<br />of him, everything falls into line.
3222050 3225340 What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't<br />seem to be worried about Luca.
3226430 3228820 If Luca sold out, we're in<br />a lot of trouble. Believe me.
3228859 3230124 A lot of trouble.
3230310 3231990 Has anyone been able<br />to get touch with Luca?
3232014 3233979 We've been trying all night.<br />He might be shacked up.
3233980 3237920 Mick, do me a favor... try<br />ringing him with the phone.
3240110 3242420 Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
3242679 3245579 Now what do we do if the<br />old man dies? God forbid.
3246450 3248060 If we lose the old man,
3249029 3251929 we lose our political contacts<br />and half our strength.
3252740 3256120 The other New York families might<br />wind up supporting Sollozzo just to
3256169 3257969 avoid a long, destructive war.
3258500 3262550 This is almost 1946.<br />Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
3263130 3264700 If your father dies
3267220 3268970 you make the deal, Sonny.
3269050 3271530 That's easy for you to say,<br />Tom. He is not your father.
3271554 3273754 I'm as much a son to<br />him as you or Mike.
3278520 3279920 What is it?
3281020 3282920 Paulie, I thought I told you to stay put.
3282944 3285344 The guy at the gates<br />say they got a package.
3286900 3288830 Tessio, go see what it is.
3292370 3294620 You want me to hang around?<br />Yeah, hang around. You all right?
3294700 3296360 Yeah, I'm fine.<br />Yeah?
3296384 3298484 There is some food in the ice<br />box. You hungry or anything?
3298540 3299930 Nah, it's alright, thanks.<br />How about a drink?
3300029 3302129 Have a little brandy.<br />That'll help sweat it out.
3302210 3304040 Go ahead, baby.<br />That might be a good idea.
3304089 3305289 Yeah, right.
3306590 3308640 I want you to take care of<br />that son of a bitch right away.
3308664 3310664 Paulie sold out the<br />old man. That stronz.
3310688 3312688 I don't wanna see him again.
3312720 3315910 Make that the first thing on your list.<br />Understand? Understood.
3316390 3319290 Mickey, tomorrow, get a couple of guys.<br />You go over to Luca's apartment.
3319379 3320734 Hang around, waiting<br />for him to show up.
3320770 3324280 Maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br />mixed up in this too directly.
3327030 3328240 Listen,
3328264 3331164 hanging around the house on the<br />phone and be a good big help.
3331610 3333530 Try Luca again, go ahead.
3342460 3345110 What the hell is this?<br />It is a Sicilian message.
3345300 3347970 It means Luca Brasi<br />sleeps with the fishes.
3361900 3363980 I'm going now.<br />What time will you be home tonight?
3364060 3365730 I don't know. Probably late.
3368280 3371350 Don't forget the cannoli!<br />Yeah, yeah.
3374200 3378700 Rocco, sit on the other side.<br />You block the rear-view mirror.
3380250 3383670 That Sonny is running wild. He is<br />thinking going to the mattresses already.
3383750 3386630 We gotta find a spot<br />over on the West Side. .
3386934 3389034 You try 309 West 43rd Street.
3389710 3392920 You know any good spot on the West Side?<br />Yeah, I think about it.
3393300 3397060 Well think about it while you're driving, will you?<br />I want to hit New York sometime this month.
3397140 3399290 And watch out for the kids<br />while you are backing out.
3409780 3412270 Paulie, I want you to go down<br />39th Street, Carlo Santos you
3412294 3415494 pick up 18 mattresses for the guys<br />to sleep while you bring me the bill.
3415660 3417080 Yeah, all right.
3417160 3418480 And make sure they're clean,
3418504 3421504 because the guys are gonna be stuck<br />up in there for a long time. You know.
3421660 3423720 They're clean. They told me<br />they exterminate them.
3423744 3425844 Exterminate? That's a bad word to use.
3426000 3428760 Exterminate! Get this guy. Watch<br />out we don't exterminate you!
3428784 3430384 You think that's funny, or what?
3432693 3434893 Rocco, what did you do?<br />Not me, nothing. It wasn't me.
3434917 3436379 It's gotta be him.
3436680 3438980 Pull over, will you?<br />I gotta take a leak.
3481060 3482470 Leave the gun.
3482809 3484409 Take the cannoli.
3502450 3505130 Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!
3507250 3509380 Yeah.<br />You're wanted on the telephone.
3515420 3517630 Who is it?<br />Some girl.
3521930 3524350 Hello. Kay?<br /><i>How is your father?</i>
3524430 3526430 He is good, he is gonna make it.
3526890 3528730 <i>I love you.</i>
3530150 3531770 <i>I love you!</i>
3532610 3535240 Michael?<br /><i>Yeah, I know.</i>
3535320 3538240 <i>Tell me you love me.</i><br />I can't talk.
3538320 3540200 <i>Can't you say it?</i>
3541410 3543280 I'll see you tonight.
3544080 3547210 Why don't you tell that<br />nice girl you love her?
3547290 3551790 I love you with all my heart. If I don't<br />see you again soon, I'm going to die!
3553170 3554750 Come over here, kid<br />and learn something.
3554789 3557589 You never know, you might have<br />to cook for 20 guys some day.
3557905 3561535 You see, you start with a little bit<br />of oil. Then you fry some garlic.
3561890 3565520 Then you throw in some tomatoes,<br />tomato paste, you fry it.
3565579 3567334 You make sure it doesn't stick.
3567600 3571590 You get it to a boil, you shove in<br />all your sausage and your meatballs.
3573570 3575050 Add a little bit of wine.
3578900 3582920 And a little bit of sugar.<br />And that's my trick.
3583450 3584800 Why don't you cut the crap?
3584859 3587459 I got more important things<br />for you to do. How is Paulie?
3587790 3589800 Paulie? You won't see him no more.
3591460 3593660 Where are you going?<br />To the city.
3594040 3595550 No. Wanna send bodyguards<br />with him, alright?
3595574 3597574 No, I'm just going to<br />the hospital to see Pop.
3597630 3600270 He'll be all right. Sollozzo<br />knows he is a civilian.
3601050 3603050 Be careful.<br />Yes, sir.
3606180 3608270 Send somebody with him anyway.
3636540 3639290 I have to go.<br />Can I go with you?
3641380 3645620 No, Kay. There is gonna be detectives<br />there, people from the press.
3645800 3647730 I'll wait in the cab.
3650560 3652690 I don't want you to get involved.
3655900 3657950 When will I see you again?
3664490 3665920 Go back to New Hampshire,
3666244 3668644 and I'll call you at your parents' house.
3670370 3672280 When will I see you again, Michael?
3673428 3675028 I don't know.
3807300 3810940 What are you doing here? You're<br />not supposed to be here now.
3811220 3814120 I'm Michael Corleone.<br />This is my father.
3814810 3817040 There is nobody here.<br />What happened to the guards?
3817230 3822050 Your father just had too many visitors.<br />They interfered with hospital service.
3822730 3826070 The police made them leave<br />about 10 minutes ago.
3830570 3833830 Get me Long Beach 45620, please.
3837080 3839410 Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
3843460 3845200 Sonny, Michel I'm at the hospital.
3845424 3847324 Listen, I got here late,<br />there is nobody here.
3847348 3848419 <i>What?</i><br />Nobody.
3848420 3852380 No Tessio's men, no detectives,<br />nobody. Papa is all alone.
3852760 3855360 <i>Don't panic. I'll send somebody.</i><br />I won't panic.
3856720 3859400 I'm sorry, but you<br />will have to leave.
3862310 3865150 You and I are gonna move<br />my father to another room.
3865230 3868130 Now can you disconnect those<br />tubes so we can move the bed out?
3868320 3871460 That's out of the question!<br />You know my father?
3871950 3875640 Men are coming here to kill him.<br />You understand?
3876330 3878020 Now help me, please.
3955200 3958490 Who are you?<br />I am Enzo, the baker.
3960030 3961980 Do you remember me?<br />Enzo.Yes, Enzo.
3962160 3965090 You'd better get out of here, Enzo.<br />There is gonna be trouble.
3965370 3969500 If there is trouble, I stay here<br />to help you. For your father.
3970440 3971640 All right.
3972000 3976030 Listen. Wait for me outside,<br />in front of the hospital, all right?
3976220 3977700 I'll be out in a minute. Go ahead!
3977759 3978959 Okay.
3992070 3993620 Just lie here, Pop.
3993944 3995644 I'll take care of you now.
3997780 3999420 I'm with you now.
4001450 4002990 I'm with you.
4038450 4040610 Get rid of these.<br />Come here.
4041570 4044000 Put your hand in your pocket,<br />like you have a gun.
4044339 4045839 You'll be all right.
4051057 4052357 You'll be okay.
4097340 4099010 You did good.
4147560 4149370 I thought I got all you<br />Guinea hoods locked up!
4149394 4150889 What the hell are you doing here?
4150890 4153280 What happened to the men who<br />were guarding my father, Captain?
4153304 4155004 Why you little punk!
4155560 4157580 What the hell are you doing<br />telling me my business?
4157604 4159204 I pulled them guys off of here.
4159228 4161609 Now you get out of here and<br />stay away from this hospital!
4162118 4165118 I'm not moving until you put some<br />guards around my father's room.
4166370 4167960 Phil, take him in!
4168099 4169554 The kid is clean, Captain.
4169740 4173080 He is a war hero. He's never been...<br />Goddamn it, I said take him in!
4175750 4178510 What's The Turk paying you<br />to set up my father, Captain?
4179458 4181758 Take a hold of him.<br />Stand him up.
4182090 4183970 Stand him up straight.
4206110 4207740 I'm attorney for the Corleone family.
4207764 4210664 These men are private detectives<br />hired to protect Vito Corleone.
4211830 4214050 They're licensed to carry firearms.
4214330 4218750 If you interfere, you'll have to appear before<br />a judge in the morning and show cause.
4218830 4220540 All right, let him go.
4221449 4222549 Come on!
4253240 4256760 What's with all the new faces?<br />We'll need them now.
4257250 4259830 After the hospital thing,<br />Sonny got mad.
4260210 4262780 We hit Bruno Tattaglia<br />4 o'clock this morning.
4264510 4266110 Jesus Christ.
4273180 4275180 Looks like a fortress around here.
4277810 4279290 Tamaduch!
4279539 4282439 100 buttonmen on the<br />street 24 hours a day.
4283270 4286560 That Turk shows one hair on<br />his ass, he is dead.Believe me!
4288900 4290990 Mike, come here!<br />Let me look at you.
4295040 4297880 You're beautiful, beautiful.<br />You're gorgeous.
4298210 4299290 Listen to this.
4299389 4300989 The Turk, he wants to talk!
4301013 4303213 You gotta imagine the nerve<br />of the son of a bitch.
4303880 4305730 Craps out last night, and<br />he wants a meeting today.
4305754 4306759 What did he say?
4306760 4308250 What did he say...
4309074 4311474 He wants us to send Michael<br />to hear the proposition.
4311640 4314900 And he promises that the deal<br />is so good that we can't refuse.
4315180 4318270 What about Bruno Tattaglia?<br />That's part of the deal.
4318350 4320550 Bruno cancels out what<br />they did to my father.
4320574 4322474 Sonny, we ought to hear<br />what they have to say.
4322505 4325435 No, no, no more!<br />Not this time, Consigliere.
4325940 4329290 No more meetings, no more<br />discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.
4329570 4331610 You give'em one message:<br />I want Sollozzo. If not,
4331634 4332699 it's all-out war.<br />We go to the mattresses...
4332700 4334460 Some of the other families<br />won't sit still for all-out war!
4334484 4335739 Then they hand me Sollozzo
4335740 4338040 Your father wouldn't want to hear<br />this! This is business, not personal.
4338120 4339440 They shot my father.<br />It is business! Your ass.
4339464 4342163 Even the shooting of your father<br />was business, not personal, Sonny!
4343460 4345510 Well then business will<br />have to suffer. All right?
4345534 4347299 And listen! Do me a favor, Tom.
4347300 4350100 No more advice on how to patch<br />things up. Just help me win, please!
4350199 4351299 All right?
4357600 4360420 I found out about this Captain<br />McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
4360519 4361574 What about him?
4361600 4365000 Now he is definitely on Sollozzo's<br />payroll, and for big money.
4365980 4367930 McCluskey has agreed to<br />be The Turk's bodyguard.
4367979 4369834 What you have to understand, Sonny,
4370110 4373160 is that while Sollozzo is being<br />guarded like that, he is invulnerable.
4373950 4377130 And nobody has ever gunned down<br />a New York police captain. Never.
4377660 4378980 It would be disastrous.
4379004 4382404 All the families would come after you, Sonny.<br />The Corleone family would be outcasts!
4383670 4386600 Even the old man's political<br />protection would run for cover.
4388800 4390430 So do me a favor.
4390754 4392454 Take this into consideration.
4396470 4398470 All right, we'll wait.
4403890 4406730 We can't wait. We can't wait.
4408015 4411275 I don't care what Sollozzo says about<br />a deal, he is gonna kill Pop. That's it.
4412240 4415150 That's the key for him.<br />Gotta get Sollozzo.
4416030 4417430 Mike is right.
4417954 4420054 Let me ask you something,<br />Professor I mean.
4420410 4422000 What about McCluskey?
4422524 4425024 What do we do with this cop here?
4430170 4432550 They want to have a<br />meeting with me, right?
4433920 4435450 It will be me...
4436374 4438374 McCluskey and Sollozzo.
4440350 4442050 Let's set the meeting.
4444520 4447830 Get our informers to find out<br />where it is gonna be held.
4450070 4453460 Now we insist it's a public place.<br />A bar, a restaurant.
4453940 4457400 Some place where there<br />is people, so I feel safe.
4460450 4463150 They're gonna search me<br />when I first meet them, right?
4463540 4465870 So I can't have a weapon on me then.
4469250 4473710 But if Clemenza can figure a way to<br />have a weapon planted there for me
4479180 4481090 then I'll kill them both.
4492605 4495305 What you gonna do?<br />Nice college boy!
4495755 4498175 Didn't want to get mixed up<br />in the family business?
4498320 4500150 Now you wanna gun down a<br />police captain. Why because
4500174 4502079 he slapped you in the face a little bit?
4502080 4503980 What do you think? This is the Army<br />where you shoot'em a mile away?
4504054 4505254 You've gotta get up close like this
4505328 4508228 and bada-bing! You blow their brains<br />all over your nice Ivy League suit.
4508670 4509910 Come here!
4510034 4511589 You're taking this very personal.
4511790 4514810 Tom, this is business and this man<br />is taking it very very personal.
4515340 4517300 Where does it say that<br />you can't kill a cop?
4517599 4518904 Come on! Mikey.
4518930 4522220 Tom, wait a minute! I'm talking about<br />a cop that is mixed up in drugs.
4522319 4524919 I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
4526060 4530050 a crooked cop who got mixed up in the<br />rackets and got what was coming to him.
4530480 4532130 That's a terrific story.
4532154 4534554 And we have newspaper people<br />on the payroll, don't we, Tom?
4536490 4540320 They might like a story like that.<br />They might. They just might.
4543990 4545680 It is not personal, Sonny.
4546104 4547904 It is strictly business.
4550790 4552330 It is as cold as they come.
4552420 4555470 Impossible to trace, so you<br />don't worry about prints, Mike.
4555815 4559855 I put a special tape on the<br />trigger and the butt. Here, try it!
4572310 4574400 What is the matter?<br />Is the trigger too tight?
4577730 4578940 Maron, my ears!
4579030 4583260 Yeah, I left it noisy. That way scares any<br />pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.
4584830 4587340 All right! You shot them both.<br />Now what do you do?
4589885 4591855 Sit down, finish my dinner.
4592114 4593879 Come on, kid.<br />Don't fool around.
4593880 4597120 Just let your hand drop to your<br />side and let the gun slip out.
4597500 4599530 Everybody will still<br />think you've got it.
4599669 4601669 They're gonna be staring<br />at your face, Mike.
4602010 4604890 So walk out of the place<br />real fast, but you don't run.
4604970 4608390 Don't look nobody directly in the<br />eye, but you don't look away either.
4608470 4611980 They're gonna be scared stiff of you.<br />Believe me! So don't worry about nothing.
4614020 4615880 You know you're gonna<br />turn out all right.
4615909 4618009 You take a vacation,<br />nobody knows where.
4618360 4620240 And we're gonna catch the hell.
4621070 4624210 How bad do you think it is gonna be?<br />Pretty goddamn bad.
4624990 4627840 Probably alll the other Families<br />will line up against us.
4628160 4630610 That's all right.This things gotta<br />happen every five, years or so
4630634 4633734 ten years. Helps to get<br />rid of the bad blood.
4633830 4635550 Been ten years since the last one.
4635769 4638269 You know you got to stop<br />them at the beginning.
4638380 4640290 Like they should have<br />stopped Hitler in Munich,
4640314 4642514 They should never've let<br />him get away with that.
4642543 4644543 They were just asking for big trouble.
4645510 4649520 You know, Mike, we was all proud<br />of you. Being a hero and all.
4650100 4651610 Your father too.
4689890 4693010 Nothing. Not a hint.<br />Absolutely nothing.
4694270 4697520 Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br />where the meeting is gonna be held.
4698610 4700640 How much time do we have?
4701820 4704610 They're gonna pick you up in front of<br />Jack Dempsey's joint in an hour and a half.
4704634 4706334 Exactly an hour and a half.
4707610 4709890 We could put a tail on them<br />and see how it turns out.
4709909 4712409 Sollozzo would lose our ass<br />going around the block!
4713870 4715620 What about the negotiator?
4715644 4718244 He is over at my place playing<br />pinochle with a couple of my men.
4718540 4720430 He is happy. They're letting him win.
4720754 4723654 There is too much of a risk for Mike.<br />Maybe we outta call it off, Sonny.
4723710 4726890 The negotiator keeps on playing cards<br />until Mike comes back safe and sound.
4727180 4729220 So why don't we just blast<br />whoever is in the goddamn car.
4729244 4731244 Too dangerous .<br />They'd be looking for that.
4731300 4734140 Sollozzo might not even<br />be in the car, Sonny!
4734730 4736130 I'll get it.
4761500 4763570 Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
4763750 4767090 Well, is it reliable?<br />That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.
4767220 4769130 A police captain's gotta<br />be on call 24 hours a day.
4769189 4771489 He signed out at that<br />number between 8 and 10.
4773010 4775890 Anybody know this joint?<br />Yeah, sure, I do.
4776514 4777979 It's perfect for us.
4777980 4781440 A small family place, good food.<br />Everyone minds his business.
4781464 4782964 It's perfect.
4783235 4788205 Pete, they've got an old-fashioned toilet.<br />You know, the box and the chain thing.
4790860 4793550 We might be able to<br />tape the gun behind it.
4794030 4795660 All right. Mike,
4796184 4797884 you go to the restaurant,
4798250 4801630 you eat, you talk for a while,<br />you relax. You make them relax.
4802210 4804850 Then you get up and<br />you go to take a leak.
4804989 4807389 No, better still, you ask<br />for permission to go.
4807630 4810290 Then when you come back, you come out<br />blasting. And don't take any chances.
4810354 4812154 Two shots in the head apiece.
4812155 4813425 Hey listen!
4813850 4816350 I want somebody good. I mean<br />very good to plant that gun.
4816430 4819940 I don't want my brother coming out of the<br />toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?
4820020 4821470 The gun will be there.
4821569 4824569 Alright. Listen, you drive him and<br />you pick him up after the job.
4825650 4827120 Come on! Let's move.
4832820 4835790 Did he tell you to drop<br />the gun right away?
4836080 4837750 Yeah, a million times.
4842710 4843820 You don't forget.
4843919 4846419 Two shots apiece in the head<br />soon as you come out the door.
4846443 4847643 Let's go.
4853510 4856600 How long do you think it will<br />be before I can come back?
4857930 4859620 At least a year, Mike.
4859915 4864415 Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know<br />you're not seeing her before you leave and...
4866480 4870420 I'll get a message to that girlfriend<br />when I think the time is right.
4876160 4877560 Take care.
4880450 4882110 Take care, Mike.
4915030 4916830 I'm glad you came, Mike.
4916854 4919054 I hope we can straighten everything out.
4920040 4922720 I mean this is terrible. It is not the<br />way I wanted things to go at all.
4922834 4925034 It should've never happened.
4925250 4929540 We'll straighten everything out tonight.<br />I don't want my father bothered anymore.
4929630 4932880 He won't be, Mike. I swear on<br />my children he won't be.
4933880 4937180 But you gotta keep an<br />open mind when we talk.
4937260 4939680 I mean I hope you're not a<br />hothead like your brother Sonny.
4939739 4941739 You can't talk business with him.
4943560 4945030 He is a good kid.
4949310 4952390 I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.
4952780 4956560 I gotta frisk you, so turn around.<br />On your knees, facing me.
4961990 4964370 I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
4965194 4966894 Too grouchy.
4968080 4971920 Can't stand the aggravation.<br />You know how it is.
4974210 4975630 He is clean.
5002240 5004140 Going to Jersey?
5007040 5008480 Maybe.
5033860 5035650 Nice work, Lou.
5072810 5075360 How is the Italian food in this restaurant?<br />Good.
5075384 5077884 Try the veal.<br />It's the best in the city.
5078440 5079810 I'll have it.
5115475 5118445 I'm gonna speak Italian to Mikey.<br />Go ahead.
5198480 5199950 What I want...
5201110 5203080 What's most important to me
5206030 5210040 is that I have a guarantee.<br />No more attempts on my father's life.
5210330 5212480 What guarantees<br />can I give you, Mike?
5213104 5215104 I'm the hunted one!
5215160 5218710 I missed my chance.<br />You think too much of me, kid.
5218790 5220630 I'm not that clever.
5222130 5224380 All I want is a truce.
5230930 5232770 I have to go to the bathroom.
5233194 5234894 Is that all right?
5236140 5238150 When you gotta go, you gotta go.
5244150 5246070 I frisked him. He is clean.
5246150 5248040 Don't take too long.
5251370 5253160 I've frisked a thousand young punks.
5543780 5545790 Okay, you take over.
5563050 5564890 I love you, Grandpa.
5567810 5570520 I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.
5571850 5574940 Here you are, big guy.<br />Give it to Grandpa. Okay.
5575060 5581020 "I hope you get well, Grandpa, and I wish<br />I'd see you soon. Love, your grandson Frank."
5584320 5586220 Go with your mother.
5586700 5588630 Take them downstairs.<br />Come on!
5594960 5597000 Go on, Carlo, you too.
5598710 5600220 Go on.
5621030 5625030 What's the matter with you, Carlo?<br />Shut up and set the table.
5640375 5642125 Since McCluskey's killing,
5642664 5646164 the police have been cracking<br />down on most of our operations.
5648390 5650270 And also the other families.
5650859 5653059 There is been a lot of bad blood.
5653350 5656650 They hit us, so we hit them back.
5657690 5662230 Through our  contacts in the newspapers<br />we've been able to put out a lot of material
5662320 5666610 about McCluskey being linked<br />with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.
5666700 5669020 See things are starting<br />to loosening up.
5670080 5674830 And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,
5674910 5677460 under the protection<br />of Don Francesco of L.A.
5677580 5679190 I want him to rest.
5679519 5682119 I'm going to learn the casino business.<br />Yeah.
5690430 5692020 Where is Michael?
5704530 5707260 It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
5709255 5713295 But he is safe. We're starting<br />to work to bring him back now.
5734680 5737060 I want you to find out where<br />that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
5737140 5739100 I want his ass now.<br />Right now!
5739190 5740330 Sonny!<br />what?
5740354 5742554 Things are starting to<br />loosen up a little bit.
5742820 5745730 If you go after Tattaglia,<br />all hell is gonna break loose.
5745829 5747584 Let the smoke clear .<br />Pop can negotiate.
5747610 5750620 No, Pop can't do nothing till he is better.<br />I'm going to decide what's going to be done.
5750644 5753644 Alright, but your war is costing us a lot of money.<br />Nothing is coming in. We can't do business.
5753700 5757640 Well neither can they. Don't worry about it!<br />We can't afford a stalemate.
5757660 5760590 Well then, there ain't no more stalemate.<br />I'm gonna end it by killing that old bastard!
5760614 5762614 Yeah, you're getting a great reputation!<br />I hope you're enjoying it.
5762710 5764260 Well you just do what<br />I tell you to do!
5764284 5767584 Goddamn it!If I had a wartime consigliere,<br />a Sicilian I wouldn't be in this shape!
5768675 5771075 Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
5774720 5776820 I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
5778180 5780450 Ma made a little dinner.<br />It's Sunday.
5782060 5786440 You know Niggers are having a good<br />time with our policy banks up in Harlem.
5786530 5790700 Driving new Cadillacs,<br />paying 50% on a bet.
5790780 5793920 I knew that was gonna happen soon<br />as they started making big money.
5794200 5797500 Papa never talked business at<br />the table and in front of the kids.
5797580 5798960 Shut up, Connie...
5798984 5801284 Don't you ever tell her to<br />shut up. You got that?
5802210 5803560 Don't interfere!
5805590 5807510 Look, Sonny, Tom! I'd like to talk<br />to you maybe after dinner.
5807534 5809534 I could be doing a lot more for the family.
5809590 5811980 We don't discuss business at the table.
5859600 5862230 I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
5867870 5869880 Why are you so far<br />from the house?
5870440 5873110 You know I'm responsible<br />to your father for your life.
5873200 5874490 The bodyguards are here.
5875410 5877040 It's still dangerous...
5877870 5880768 We've heard from Santino<br />in New York...
5881040 5883290 Your enemies know you're here.
5884290 5887595 Did Santino say when<br />I can go back?
5887710 5889000 Not yet.
5889670 5891510 It's out of the question.
5894970 5896390 Where are you going now?
5898050 5899200 To Corleone.
5899720 5900970 Take my car.
5903750 5905460 I want to walk.
5907980 5909150 Be careful.
5943680 5945060 Where have all the men gone?
5945436 5948310 They're all dead from vendettas.
5949381 5952260 Look, there are the<br />names of the dead.
5968750 5972880 Hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
5972960 5977260 Hey, take me to the America, G.I.!<br />Clark Gable!
5977380 5982640 America! Take me to the America, G.I.!<br />Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!
6000570 6002620 Mamma mia, what a beauty.
6011559 6013880 You look like you got<br />struck by a thunderbolt.
6020618 6024100 In Sicily women are more<br />dangerous than shotguns.
6047792 6049251 Did you have a good hunt?
6049710 6052067 You know all the girls around here?
6052267 6054958 We saw some real beauties.
6055130 6058630 One of them struck our<br />friend like a thunderbolt.
6061840 6064600 She would tempt the devil himself.
6068565 6071893 I understand, really 'put together'
6072230 6074400 Really put together.
6074480 6075630 Right, Calo?
6079280 6081280 Such hair, such mouth!
6083660 6086830 The girls around here are<br />beautiful... but virtuous.
6087370 6089750 This one had a purple dress...
6090120 6092250 And a purple ribbon in her hair.
6093120 6096590 A type more Greek than Italian.
6098710 6100550 Do you know her?
6104670 6107660 There is no girl like that in this town.
6110192 6111780 My God, I understand!
6115810 6117260 What is wrong?
6119659 6121132 Let's go.
6122560 6124010 It's his daughter.
6124070 6125570 Tell him to come here.
6125943 6128845 You don't understand,<br />it is his daughter!
6128990 6130330 Call him.
6150390 6152920 Fabrizio, you translate.
6156850 6158730 I apologize if I offended you.
6159730 6161640 I'm a stranger in this country.
6163202 6165687 I meant no disrespect<br />to you or your daughter.
6168900 6171580 Who is he? He sounds American.
6171790 6174660 I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.
6176080 6178420 My name is Michael Corleone.
6180160 6183101 There are people who'd pay a<br />lot of money for that information.
6186560 6188591 But then your daughter<br />would lose a father
6191190 6193570 instead of gaining a husband.
6201940 6204150 I want to meet your daughter.
6204820 6208778 With your permission, and under<br />the supervision of your family.
6210070 6211740 With all respect.
6217790 6221790 Come to my house Sunday morning.<br />My name is Vitelli.
6228037 6229932 And what is your daughter's name?
6230080 6231563 Apollonia.
6404140 6406010 I'm gonna knock you dizzy.
6412070 6413950 Save it for the library.
6417820 6420490 Come on! We got to pick<br />up my sister. Let's go.
6438550 6440060 What's the matter?
6442720 6444320 What's the matter?
6446310 6448030 It was my fault!<br />Where is he?
6448045 6451215 Sonny, please. It was<br />my fault. I hit him.
6451570 6455360 I started a fight with him. Please<br />Sonny. I hit him, so he hit me...
6459340 6460340 Okay.
6460570 6463870 I'm just gonna get a doctor to come<br />and take a look at you. Alright?
6463950 6466460 Sonny, please don't do anything.
6468420 6470500 What's the matter with you?<br />What am I gonna do?
6470580 6473460 Make that baby an orphan<br />before he is born?
6476198 6477298 All right?
6478010 6481220 This fat slob is still betting<br />the Yankees pretty heavy?
6481300 6483970 You tell them to stop<br />taking action on them. Alright?
6484810 6486720 We lost enough money<br />last week on the game.
6493650 6495690 Come here, come here!
6552385 6555425 You touch my sister again,<br />I'll kill you.
6789190 6790250 Hey!
6790274 6793274 We weren't expecting you, Kay.<br />You should call.
6793530 6797370 Yes, well I have. I mean<br />I've tried writing and calling.
6797950 6801790 Now I want to reach Michael.<br />Nobody knows where he is.
6801870 6804020 We know that he is<br />alright. But that's all.
6806795 6808325 What was that?
6808449 6810849 Well, that was an accident,<br />but nobody was hurt.
6811720 6812850 Tom,
6812874 6815174 will you give this letter<br />to Michael, please?
6815198 6816298 Please?
6817390 6818860 Well, if I accepted that,
6818884 6822284 in a court could of law they could prove<br />that I have knowledge of his whereabouts.
6822573 6825524 Now you just be patient, Kay.<br />He'll get in touch with you. Alright?
6825560 6829230 I let my cab go, so can I come<br />in to call another one, please?
6829320 6831190 Come on. I'm sorry.<br />Come on!
6848420 6849890 Hello?
6850514 6852514 Hello?<br /><i>Is Carlo there?</i>
6853880 6856340 Who is this?<br /><i>This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>
6856430 6859810 <i>Would you tell him that I can't<br />make it tonight until later?</i>
6865560 6866810 Bitch!
6868820 6871610 Dinner is on the table.<br />I'm not hungry yet.
6871690 6875030 The food is on the table. It is getting cold.<br />I'll eat out later.
6875110 6878490 You just told me to make you dinner!<br />Vafangool!
6878700 6880830 I'll vafangool you!
6885670 6888460 She has a filthy mouth,<br />this little Guinea brat.
6892800 6896840 That's it, break it all, you spoiled<br />Guinea brat. Break it all!
6906350 6909480 Why don't you bring your<br />whore home for dinner?
6910480 6912350 Maybe I will. Why not?
6918910 6922080 Now clean it up!<br />Like hell I will!
6922160 6926080 You skinny, spoiled brat.<br />Clean it up! Clean it up!
6926160 6930170 Clean it up! I said, clean it up!<br />Clean it up!
6930750 6935590 Clean it up. Clean that up, you...
6938840 6940250 Clean it!
6940640 6941890 Clean it up!
6941914 6944814 Yeah, come on now. Kill me!<br />Be a murderer, like your father!
6944970 6947240 Come on! All you Corleones<br />are murderers anyway!
6947264 6948519 I hate you. I'll kill you.
6948520 6950230 Come on, kill me!
6950231 6951745 Get out!
6951770 6953240 Get out of here!
6953520 6956450 I hate you!<br />Go ahead. Now I'll kill you.
6957030 6959900 You Guinea brat you.<br />Get out of here!
6970170 6973330 Connie, what's the matter?<br />I can't hear you. What is it?
6974250 6977300 Connie, talk louder.<br />The baby is crying.
6977380 6980400 Santino, I can't understand.<br />I don't know. I don't understand her.
6981590 6983390 Yeah, Connie.
6986035 6987635 <i>...now don't you come..</i>
6988060 6989920 Listen, you wait there.
6992650 6995190 No, you just wait there.
6997360 6999610 Son of a bitch.
6999700 7002910 Son of a bitch!<br />What's the matter?
7007080 7010060 Open the goddamn gate!<br />Get off your ass.
7018170 7019420 Sonny!
7025890 7027990 Sonny, come on.<br />Get out of here!
7028980 7030850 Move out, go on!
7060590 7062630 Son of a bitch. Come on!
7171330 7172960 Give me a drop.
7181590 7183780 My wife is crying upstairs.
7186260 7188760 I hear cars coming to the house.
7193430 7195350 Consigliere of mine,
7196430 7199940 I think you should tell your Don<br />what everyone seems to know.
7200020 7202400 I didn't tell Mama anything.
7203360 7206610 I was about to come up and<br />wake you just now and tell you.
7210110 7212330 But you needed a drink first.
7214660 7215910 Yeah.
7219210 7221410 Well, now you've had your drink.
7227260 7231140 They shot Sonny on the causeway.<br />He is dead.
7248190 7250640 I want no inquiries made.
7255200 7257650 I want no acts of vengeance.
7259460 7261690 I want you to arrange a meeting
7263290 7265520 with the heads of the five families.
7267840 7269820 This war stops now.
7291860 7293710 Call Bonasera.
7294490 7296560 I need him now.
7309050 7314220 This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling<br />for Vito Corleone, at his request.
7314300 7316680 Now you owe your Don a service.
7316760 7319710 He has no doubt that you will repay it.
7320390 7324430 Now he will be at your funeral parlor<br />in one hour. Be there to greet him.
7345920 7350710 Well, my friend, are you ready<br />to do me this service?
7350800 7353880 Yes. What do you want me to do?
7362270 7366730 I want you to use all your<br />powers and all your skills.
7370900 7373820 I don't want his mother<br />to see him this way.
7389840 7392960 Look how they massacred my boy.
7423252 7425150 It is safer to teach you English!
7425600 7427020 I know English...
7427079 7431790 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,<br />Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.
7432214 7433721 C'mon, let's go.
7439859 7441300 Greetings, Don Tommasino.
7442439 7444010 How are things in Palermo?
7450020 7453002 Michael is teaching me to drive...
7453789 7455941 watch, I'll show you.
7456860 7458700 How are things in Palermo?
7459170 7462300 Young people don't respect<br />anything anymore...
7462409 7465486 times are changing for the worse.
7467363 7470604 This place has become<br />too dangerous for you.
7470804 7474583 I don't think you're<br />safe here anymore.
7474657 7480220 I want you to move to a villa<br />near Siracusa... immediatly.
7485333 7486846 What's wrong?
7488149 7490730 Bad news from America.
7492027 7494052 Your brother, Santino.
7494680 7496378 They killed him.
7501363 7503242 Michele, let's go.
7503490 7505330 Let's go, you promised me.
7524140 7525641 Fabrizio!<br />Yes?
7525741 7527228 Get the car.
7527720 7529805 Are you driving yourself, Boss?<br />Yes.
7530396 7532015 Is your wife coming with you?
7532121 7535404 No, I want you to take her to her<br />father's house 'til I know things are safe.
7535940 7537860 Okay. Anything you say, Boss.
7543780 7545530 Calo, where is Apollonia?
7546280 7549790 She is going to surprise you.<br />She wants to drive.
7552294 7554655 She'll make a good American wife.
7556042 7558130 Wait, I'll get the baggage.
7568192 7569397 Fabrizio!
7570640 7572310 Where are you going?
7573079 7576440 Michele, wait there!<br />I'll drive to you.
7582570 7583990 No, Apollonia!
7607050 7612590 Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping<br />me organize this meeting here today,
7613020 7617860 And also the other heads of the five<br />families, New York and New Jersey.
7619610 7622540 Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,
7623185 7625325 and Brooklyn
7627780 7629870 Philip Tattaglia.
7631660 7633870 And from Staten Island,
7634460 7637660 we have with us Victor Strachi.
7638040 7643670 And all the other associates that came<br />as far as from California and Kansas City
7643760 7647510 and all the other territories<br />of the country. Thank you.
7654350 7656810 How did things ever get so far?
7657900 7659320 I don't know.
7661570 7664870 It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.
7668200 7671620 Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.
7674080 7677500 We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,
7677580 7681690 then I'm willing to let things go<br />on the way they were before.
7683050 7686670 We're grateful to Don Corleone<br />for calling this meeting.
7686760 7688840 We all know him as a man of his word,
7689064 7691664 a modest man. He'll<br />always listen to reason.
7692220 7695710 Yes, Don Barzini. He is too modest.
7696390 7700000 He had all the judges and<br />politicians in his pocket.
7700690 7702970 He refused to share them.
7703650 7706340 When did I ever refuse<br />an accommodation?
7707530 7709810 All of you know me here.
7710820 7715890 When did I ever refuse,<br />except one time? And why?
7717660 7722800 Because I believe this drug business is<br />gonna destroy us in the years to come.
7723590 7727740 I mean it's not like gambling<br />or liquor or even women,
7727920 7730490 which is something that most<br />people want nowadays, and
7730514 7733414 is forbidden to them by<br />the pezzonovante of Church.
7734010 7738730 Even the police departments that have helped<br />us in the past with gambling and other things
7738810 7743020 are going to refuse to help us<br />when it comes to narcotics.
7743110 7747940 I believed that then<br />and I believe that now.
7748320 7750130 Times have changed.
7750650 7754770 It's not like the old days, when<br />we can do anything we want.
7755450 7757630 A refusal is not the act of a friend.
7758410 7761730 If Don Corleone had all the judges<br />and politicians in New York,
7761854 7763754 then he must share them
7763920 7768310 or let others use them. He must let<br />us draw the water from the well.
7769590 7772980 Certainly he can present<br />a bill for such services.
7773260 7775750 After all, we're not Communists.
7778970 7781360 I also don't believe in drugs.
7782190 7786720 For years I paid my people extra, so<br />they wouldn't do that kind of business.
7787110 7789940 Somebody comes to them<br />and says: " I have powders."
7790320 7793570 "If you put up three, four<br />thousand dollar investment,
7793860 7796460 we can make 50,000 distributing."
7797870 7802990 So they can't resist. I want to control<br />it as a business to keep it respectable.
7803870 7808270 I don't want it near schools,<br />I don't want it sold to children.
7808750 7810450 That is an inf√†mia.
7811880 7815700 In my city we would keep the traffic<br />in the dark people, the colored.
7815890 7819100 They're animals anyway,<br />so let them lose their souls.
7825730 7829120 I hoped that we could come<br />here and reason together.
7830730 7835070 And as a reasonable man, I'm willing<br />to do whatever is necessary to
7835184 7837484 find a peaceful solution<br />to these problems.
7837910 7839400 Then we are agreed.
7839624 7842324 The traffic in drugs will be<br />permitted, but controlled.
7842580 7846880 And Don Corleone will give up protection<br />in the East, and there will be the peace.
7846960 7849910 But I must have strict<br />assurance from Corleone.
7850800 7854090 As time goes by and his<br />position becomes stronger,
7854170 7856640 will he attempt any individual vendetta?
7856665 7858695 Look, we are all reasonable men here.
7858719 7861419 We don't have to give assurances<br />as if we were lawyers.
7862140 7864320 You talk about vengeance.
7865100 7868260 Is vengeance gonna bring<br />your son back to you?
7868440 7870280 Or my boy to me?
7871070 7873460 I forgo the vengeance of my son.
7876660 7878950 But I have selfish reasons.
7881240 7884530 My youngest son was forced<br />to leave this country
7886710 7889250 because of this Sollozzo business.
7889274 7890789 All right.
7890790 7894620 And I have to make arrangements<br />to bring him back here safely.
7894800 7897270 Cleared of all these false charges.
7898890 7900910 But I'm a superstitious man.
7902140 7904040 If an unlucky accident should befall him,
7904064 7906964 if he should get shot in the<br />head by a police officer,
7908810 7912200 or if he should hang<br />himself in his jail cell,
7912480 7915360 or if he is struck by a bolt of lightning,
7916650 7920240 then I'm going to blame<br />some of the people in this room.
7921910 7923940 And that I do not forgive.
7926710 7929080 But, that aside
7932170 7934500 let me say that I swear
7936130 7938760 on the souls of my grandchildren,
7939340 7943720 that I will not be the one to break<br />the peace we've made here today.
7969210 7970770 When I meet with the Tattaglia people,
7970794 7973694 should I insist that all his drug<br />middlemen have clean records?
7974750 7976880 Mention it. Don't insist.
7978880 7981700 Barzini is a man who will<br />know that without being told.
7982009 7983709 You mean Tattaglia?
7985430 7987190 Tattaglia is a pimp.
7988480 7991600 He could never have outfought Santino.
7993980 7999570 But I didn't know until this day<br />that it was Barzini all along.
8015040 8016930 Come on, Nancy.
8018340 8020820 Keep together, everyone. Brian.
8022260 8023830 Okay, all right.
8037020 8039230 How long have you been back?
8040030 8041860 I've been back a year.
8043280 8045310 Longer than that, I think.
8048240 8050410 It's good to see you, Kay.
8061470 8063710 I'm working for my father now, Kay.
8066510 8069510 He's been sick. Very sick.
8071060 8073020 But you're not like him, Michael.
8073100 8075400 I thought you weren't going<br />to become a man like your father.
8075499 8077399 That's what you told me.
8078820 8082710 My father is no different<br />than any other powerful man.
8083200 8086560 Any man who is responsible<br />for other people.
8087870 8089890 Like a senator or president.
8090370 8092830 You know how naive you sound?<br />Why?
8092910 8095750 Senators and presidents<br />don't have men killed.
8098945 8100745 Who is being naive, Kay?
8102145 8106605 Kay, my father's way of doing things is<br />over. It is finished. Even he knows that.
8108220 8112600 I mean in five years the Corleone family<br />is going to be completely legitimate.
8114430 8118400 Trust me. That's all I can tell<br />you about my business. Kay...
8119585 8122605 Michael, why did you<br />come here? Why?
8124065 8128905 What do you want with me after all<br />this time? Here I was calling and writing.
8129200 8132600 I came because I need you.<br />Because I care for you.
8132790 8136620 Please stop it, Michael.<br />Because... I want you to marry me.
8138330 8140920 It's too late.<br />Please, Kay...
8142325 8146205 I'll do anything you ask, anything to<br />make up for what's happened to us.
8148220 8152470 Because that's important, Kay.<br />Because what's important is that
8154020 8157270 we have each other.<br />That we have a life together.
8158850 8161570 That we have children. Our children.
8163070 8165240 Kay, I need you.
8167200 8168780 And I love you.
8190930 8194680 Barzini's people chisel my territory<br />and we do nothing about it!
8194810 8196840 Pretty soon there won't be one<br />place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat!
8196864 8198319 Just be patient.
8198520 8201650 I'm not asking for help, Mike.<br />Just take off the handcuffs.
8201730 8204860 Be patient.<br />We got to protect ourselves.
8204940 8206900 Give me a chance to<br />recruit some new men.
8206979 8208244 No.
8208490 8210770 I don't want to give Barzini<br />an excuse to start fighting.
8210794 8212594 Mike, you're wrong.
8213870 8215540 Don Corleone...
8216120 8220250 You once said that the day would come when<br />Tessio and me could form our own family.
8220330 8224380 Till today I would never think of it.<br />I must ask your permission.
8225380 8228050 Well, Michael is now head of the family.
8228130 8232030 If he gives his permission,<br />then you have my blessing.
8232510 8234690 After we make the move to Nevada,
8234970 8237990 you can break off from the Corleone<br />family and go on your own.
8237999 8239464 After we make the move to Nevada.
8239480 8241210 How long will that be?
8242049 8243649 Six months.
8243900 8246650 Forgive me, Godfather,<br />but with you gone,
8247230 8250070 me and Pete will come under<br />Barzini's thumb sooner or later.
8250150 8251830 And I hate that goddamn Barzini.
8251854 8254754 In six months' time, there will<br />be nothing left to build on.
8255910 8258630 Do you have faith in my judgment?<br />Yes.
8258910 8261830 Do I have your loyalty?<br />Yes, always, Godfather.
8261920 8265270 Then be a friend to Michael.<br />Do as he says.
8270090 8275430 There are things being negotiated now that are gonna<br />solve all your problems and answer all your questions.
8275510 8277350 That's all I can tell you now.
8278680 8281270 Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
8281350 8284330 When we make our move there,<br />you'll be my right-hand man.
8284810 8288910 Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.<br />He is gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.
8289690 8292240 That's no reflection on Tom,<br />but that's the way I want it.
8292320 8296230 Besides if I ever need help, who is<br />a better consigliere than my father?
8296254 8297754 That's it.
8317050 8319790 Thank you, Papa.<br />I'm happy for you, Carlo.
8320970 8322290 Mike...
8322514 8324114 Why am I out?
8325400 8327810 You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.
8329400 8332650 Things may get rough with<br />the move we are trying.
8332740 8334030 Tom.
8339200 8344370 I advised Michael. I never thought<br />you were a bad consigliere.
8344460 8348590 I thought Santino was<br />a bad Don, rest in peace.
8350050 8353260 Michael has all my confidence,<br />just as you do.
8354260 8359220 But there are reasons why you must<br />have no part in what is going to happen.
8360260 8363310 Maybe I could help.<br />You're out, Tom.
8412480 8416480 I can't get over the way your<br />face looks. It really looks good!
8416900 8419890 This doctor did some job.<br />Who talked you into it? Kay?
8419984 8421539 Hey, wait!
8421570 8423700 Leave them out here.<br />We'll deal with them later.
8423709 8425374 He is tired and wants to clean up.
8425435 8427505 But right now, let me<br />open the door, all right?
8434340 8436460 Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
8436469 8439269 All for you, kid! It's all<br />his idea right? Didn't you?
8439840 8442470 Your brother Freddy.<br />Well it was... girls here?
8446390 8449180 I'll be right back.<br />You keep them occupied.
8450690 8454190 Anything you want, kid, anything.<br />Who are the girls?
8455610 8459030 That's for you to find out.<br />Get rid of them, Fredo.
8460570 8461740 Hey, Mike...<br />Fredo
8461764 8464664 I'm here on business. I leave<br />tomorrow. Now get rid of them.
8465330 8468000 I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.
8473880 8477170 Hey, take off. Take off.<br />Let's go.
8477260 8479380 Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.
8481090 8483220 Hey, come on! Scram!
8484890 8486930 Come on, honey. Let's go!<br />I don't know, Johnny.
8486939 8488504 I don't know what the<br />hell's the matter with him.
8488520 8489810 I'm sorry.
8491770 8494310 I don't know. He is tired.
8501320 8503310 What happened to Moe Greene?
8504490 8508730 He said he had some business. He said<br />to give him a call when the party started.
8508910 8510770 Well, give him a call.
8512250 8515080 Johnny, how are you?<br />Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.
8515460 8517670 We're all proud of you.<br />Thanks, Mike.
8517750 8519440 Sit down, Jonny.<br />I want to talk toyou.
8519464 8521419 The Don is proud of you too, Jonny.
8521420 8523680 Well, I owe it all to him.
8524890 8526470 Well, he knows how grateful you are.
8526550 8529610 That's why he'd like<br />to ask a favor of you.
8529890 8531610 Mike, what can I do?
8532980 8535440 The Corleone Family is thinking<br />of giving up all its interests
8535520 8538440 in the olive oil business,<br />settling out here.
8539280 8542010 Moe will sell us his share of<br />the casino and the hotel,
8542034 8544434 so it could be completely<br />owned by the Family.
8544700 8547450 Tom!<br />Mike, are you sure about that?
8547530 8550540 Moe loves the business. He never<br />said nothing to me about selling.
8550620 8553130 Yeah, I'll make him<br />an offer he can't refuse.
8554620 8556440 See, Johnny...
8557130 8561340 See we figure that entertainment will be a<br />big factor in drawing gamblers to the casino.
8561420 8564980 We hope you'll sign a contract<br />to appear five times a year.
8568100 8572330 Perhaps convince some of your<br />friends in the movies to do the same.
8573980 8575900 We're counting on you.
8578110 8581080 Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for<br />my godfather. You know that.
8581860 8583150 Good.
8584780 8588810 Hey, Mike! Hello, fellas.<br />Everybody is here. Freddy, Tom.
8589490 8591840 Good to see you, Mike.<br />How are you, Moe?
8591845 8593535 All right. You got everything<br />you want? The chef cooked
8593604 8597204 for you special, the dancers will kick<br />your tongue out, and your credit is good.
8597330 8600320 Draw chips for everybody in the room,<br />so they can play on the house.
8603590 8606040 My credit good enough<br />to buy you out?
8608090 8609730 Buy me out?
8610010 8612200 The casino, the hotel.
8612680 8615200 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy you out.
8615690 8617810 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy me out?
8617834 8620534 No, I buy you out.<br />You don't buy me out.
8621190 8624310 Your casino loses money.<br />Maybe we can do better.
8624690 8626870 You think I'm skimming<br />off the top, Mike?
8627094 8628694 You're unlucky.
8633370 8635690 You goddamn Guineas really make me laugh.
8635910 8638500 I do you a favor and  take Freddy<br />in when you are having a bad time,
8638524 8640224 and then you try to push me out!
8640293 8641524 Wait a minute!
8641880 8645300 You took Freddie in because the<br />Corleone Family bankrolled your casino.
8645380 8648640 Because the Molinari family on<br />the Coast guaranteed his safety.
8648664 8650664 Now we're talking business.<br />Let's talk business!
8650720 8653470 Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.<br />First of all, you're all done.
8653560 8656120 The Corleone Familyd don't even<br />have that kind of muscle anymore.
8656140 8657620 The Godfather is sick, right?
8657644 8660544 You're getting chased out of New<br />York by Barzini and the other Families.
8660610 8662130 What do you think is going on here?
8662154 8664454 You think you can come<br />to my hotel and take over?
8664610 8669160 I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal<br />with him and still keep my hotel!
8669740 8672740 Is that why you slapped<br />my brother around in public?
8673330 8677860 Now...that was nothing, Mike. Now<br />Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
8678250 8680260 Sure he flies off the handle<br />once in a while, but...
8680284 8682484 but Moe and me we're<br />good friends. Right, Moe?
8682540 8684300 I got a business to run.
8684324 8686824 I gotta kick asses sometimes<br />to make it run right.
8687380 8690660 We had a little argument, Freddy<br />and I, so I had to straighten him out.
8691340 8693580 You straightened my brother out?
8694260 8696430 He was banging cocktail<br />waitresses two at a time!!
8696454 8698654 Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
8698810 8700570 What's wrong with you?
8705650 8707480 I leave for New York tomorrow.
8707504 8709204 Think about a price.
8709700 8711220 Son of a bitch!
8711410 8713680 Do you know who I am?<br />I'm Moe Greene!
8713704 8716504 I made my bones when you<br />were going out with cheerleaders.
8716660 8719160 Wait a minute, Moe.<br />I got an idea.
8720290 8723840 Tom, you're the consigliere.<br />And you can talk to the Don...
8723960 8725540 Just a minute now.
8725564 8728864 The Don is semi-retired and Mike is<br />in charge of the family business now.
8729420 8732560 If you have anything to say,<br />say it to Michael.
8736125 8737425 Mike!
8737640 8741680 You don't come to Las Vegas and<br />talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
8743230 8744440 Fredo...
8745650 8748400 You're my older brother, and I love you.
8749860 8753870 But don't ever take sides with<br />anyone against the family again.
8755370 8756520 Ever.
8764500 8766470 I have to see my father<br />and his people,
8766594 8768594 so have dinner without me.<br />Oh, Michael...
8770420 8771900 This weekend we'll go out.
8771924 8774824 We'll go to the city, we'll see a show<br />and we'll have dinner. I promise.
8782690 8785430 Michael, your sister wants<br />to ask you something.
8785810 8787940 Well, let her ask.<br />No, she is afraid to.
8788020 8790990 Connie and Carlo want you to<br />be godfather to their little boy.
8791070 8792900 Well, we'll see.<br />Will you?
8792990 8795320 Let me think about it.<br />We'll see. Come on.
8802185 8803385 So
8804210 8806680 Barzini will move against you first.
8807170 8810890 He'll set up a meeting with<br />someone that you absolutely trust.
8811670 8813520 Guaranteeing your safety.
8814970 8817550 And at that meeting<br />you'll be assassinated.
8822770 8825770 I like to drink wine more than I used to.
8827190 8830690 Anyway, I'm drinking more.<br />It's good for you, Pop.
8835740 8837240 I don't know.
8839280 8841800 Your wife and children,<br />are you happy with them?
8843160 8846000 Very happy.<br />That's good.
8847880 8852760 I hope you don't mind the way I keep<br />going over this Barzini business.
8852840 8854500 No, not at all.
8854724 8856424 It's an old habit.
8857260 8860260 I spend my life trying not to be careless.
8861810 8865070 Women and children can<br />be careless, but not men.
8868600 8870940 How is your boy?<br />He is good.
8871070 8873580 You know he looks more<br />like you every day.
8876490 8878350 He is smarter than I am.
8878374 8880674 Three years old, he can<br />read the funny papers.
8883080 8885120 Read the funny papers.
8892340 8894370 I want you to arrange to<br />have a telephone man
8894394 8896494 check all the calls that go
8896518 8898089 in and out of here, because...
8898090 8899790 I did it already, Pop.<br />You 'know, cuz it could be anyone...
8899814 8902814 I took care of that.<br />That's right. I forgot.
8907440 8908850 What's the matter?
8909980 8911620 What is bothering you?
8915610 8917140 I'll handle it.
8917364 8919764 I told you I can handle it,<br />I'll handle it.
8933500 8936610 I knew that Santino was<br />going to go through all this.
8938090 8939720 And Fredo...
8942430 8944370 Fredo was, well...
8946350 8948990 But I never wanted this for you.
8951520 8956170 I worked my whole life. I don't<br />apologize to take care of my family.
8956650 8959370 And I refused to be a fool,
8960660 8964380 dancing on a string held<br />by all those big shots.
8966740 8970210 I don't apologize. That's my life,<br />but I thought that,
8971870 8976850 that when it was your time, that you<br />would be the one to hold the strings.
8978840 8983810 Senator Corleone. Governor<br />Corleone or something.
8984600 8986500 Another pezzonovante.
8987680 8988950 Well...
8992560 8995480 This wasn't enough time, Michael.<br />Wasn't enough time.
8996570 8998270 We'll get there, Pop.
8998694 9000394 We'll get there.
9004910 9009370 Now listen, whoever comes to<br />you with this Barzini meeting,
9009450 9012420 he is the traitor. Don't forget that!
9029390 9031520 Can I hold it, please?
9046620 9050490 Can I water these?<br />Yes, go ahead.
9050580 9053370 Over here, over here.
9055250 9057750 Be careful. You're spilling it.
9064130 9065490 Anthony!
9065970 9067640 Come here, come here.
9072810 9075480 That's it. We'll put it right there.
9080690 9083280 I'll show you something. Come here.
9085320 9087100 Stand there.
9090950 9092700 Give me an orange!
9111060 9112850 That's a new trick.
9113850 9116190 You run in there. Run in there.
9129740 9131300 Where are you?
9309380 9311260 Mike, can I have a minute?
9321850 9323810 Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
9324390 9326890 He says we can straighten<br />any of our problems out.
9328360 9330370 You talked to him?<br />Yeah.
9331900 9335100 I can arrange security. On my territory.
9338740 9341090 All right?<br />All right.
9358800 9360960 Do you know how they<br />are gonna come at you?
9364270 9367440 They're arranging a meeting<br />in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground
9370110 9371900 Where I'll be safe.
9384160 9386850 I always thought it would've<br />been Clemenza, not Tessio.
9387830 9391230 It's a smart move.<br />Tessio was always smarter.
9393880 9395470 But I'm gonna wait.
9395840 9397390 After the baptism.
9400720 9403310 I've decided to be godfather<br />to Connie's baby.
9404390 9408260 And then I'll meet with<br />Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
9410150 9412510 All the heads of the five families.
9554080 9558740 Michael, do you believe in God, the Father<br />Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth?
9559130 9560300 I do.
9560380 9563780 Do you believe in Jesus Christ,<br />His only Son, our Lord?
9563970 9564970 I do.
9565050 9568800 Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,<br />the Holy Catholic Church?
9569180 9570470 I do.
9636040 9640180 Michael Francis Rizzi,<br />do you renounce Satan?
9646630 9647880 I do renounce him.
9657560 9658980 And all his works?
9672870 9674020 I do renounce them.
9675660 9676910 Oh, God!
9679830 9683400 And all his pomps?<br />I do renounce them.
9699270 9703180 Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?
9703560 9704770 I will.
9711910 9717410 Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and<br />may the Lord be with you. Amen.
9731630 9733150 Kay!
9733640 9735600 Come on! Kiss your godfather.
9760000 9761380 Carlo!<br />Come on.
9761459 9762859 Can't go to Vegas.
9762883 9764169 Something's come up.
9764170 9765830 Everybody is going to leave without us.
9765920 9768880 Mike, it's our first vacation together!<br />Connie, please.
9769000 9772510 Go back to the house, wait<br />for my call. It's important.
9773630 9775810 I'll only be a couple of days.
9792280 9794290 We're on our way to Brooklyn.
9796660 9798710 I hope Mike can get us<br />a good deal tonight.
9798734 9800334 I'm sure he will.
9808210 9809630 Sal, Tom,
9809654 9812954 the boss says he'll come in a separate<br />car, he says for you two to go on ahead.
9813720 9816160 Hell, he can't do that. That<br />screws up all my arrangements.
9816184 9817339 That's what he said.
9817340 9819410 I can't go either, Sal.
9831480 9833500 Tell Mike it was only business.
9833979 9835679 I always liked him.
9837070 9839910 He understands that.<br />Excuse me, Sal.
9845910 9848180 Tom, can you get me off the hook?
9849540 9852510 For old times' sake?<br />Can't do it, Sally.
9898130 9900870 You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.
9905850 9907170 Mike, you got it all wrong.
9907239 9909339 You fingered Sonny<br />for the Barzini people.
9910810 9914330 That little farce you<br />played with my sister.
9914820 9916910 You think that could fool a Corleone?
9916979 9919279 Mike, I'm innocent.<br />I swear on the kids.
9919990 9922500 Please Mike, don't do this to me.<br />Sit down.
9925370 9927660 Don't do this to me, please.
9936920 9938670 Barzini is dead.
9940800 9942740 So is Philip Tattaglia.
9944350 9945750 Moe Greene.
9946810 9948300 Strachi.
9949379 9950779 Cuneo.
9952560 9957520 Today I settle all family business,<br />so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
9957900 9959690 Admit what you did.
9963620 9965280 Get him a drink.
9971580 9972870 Come on.
9974210 9976230 Don't be afraid, Carlo.
9976710 9979490 Come on! You think I'd<br />make my sister a widow?
9980720 9983430 I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.
9990350 9992390 Go ahead, drink, drink.
9997190 10001030 No Carlo, you're out of the family<br />business. That's your punishment.
10002110 10005670 You're finished. I'm putting<br />you on a plane to Vegas.
10006160 10007580 Tom.
10011910 10015200 I want you to stay there.<br />Understand?
10015580 10017870 Only don't tell me you're innocent.
10019420 10023280 Because it insults my intelligence.<br />And makes me very angry.
10027930 10029770 Now who approached you?
10031270 10033180 Tattaglia or Barzini?
10041360 10042970 It was Barzini.
10047200 10048780 Good.
10055000 10058540 There is a car waiting for you<br />outside to take you to the airport.
10059130 10062170 I'll call your wife to tell<br />her what flight you're on.
10066970 10069510 Mike please...<br />Come on, get out of my sight.
10095660 10097290 Hello, Carlo.
10157140 10160270 I'm trying to tell you...<br />Mama, please!
10168650 10170740 Michael!
10170820 10172820 What is it?<br />Where is he?
10175240 10179570 Michael, you lousy bastard!<br />You killed my husband.
10180460 10184540 You waited until Papa died, so nobody<br />could stop you, and then you killed him.
10184630 10187610 You blamed him for Sonny.<br />You always did. Everybody did.
10187800 10190700 But you never thought about me!<br />You never gave a damn about me.
10190934 10193234 Now what are we going to do?
10193680 10195210 Connie.
10197560 10200270 Why do you think he<br />kept Carlo at the mall?
10200350 10203190 All the time he knew he<br />was going to kill him.
10203270 10208210 And you stood godfather to our baby.<br />You lousy cold-hearted bastard!
10208690 10212180 Want to know how many men he had<br />killed with Carlo? Read the papers!
10212860 10215620 That's your husband,<br />that's your husband!
10225290 10228710 No! No, no...
10229590 10232970 Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.
10254110 10255620 She is hysterical.
10260370 10261920 Hysterical.
10264120 10265730 Michael, is it true?
10267840 10271210 Don't ask me about my business, Kay.<br />Is it true?
10271590 10274040 Don't ask me about my business.<br />No! Enough!
10294400 10295910 All right.
10298740 10300490 This one time.
10304460 10307790 This one time I'll let you<br />ask me about my affairs.
10313880 10315300 Is it true?
10319390 10320890 Is it?
10322640 10324020 No.
10337950 10340910 I guess we both need a drink.<br />Come on.
10372190 10373900 Don Corleone.
