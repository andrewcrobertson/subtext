51343 54179 I believe in America.
54263 57224 America has made my fortune.
57308 61437 And I raised my daughter<br />in the American fashion.
61520 66358 I gave her freedom, but I taught her<br />never to dishonor her family.
67818 70946 She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.
71030 75451 She went to the movies with him.<br />She stayed out late.
75534 77244 I didn't protest.
78329 83042 Two months ago he took her for a drive<br />with another boyfriend.
84084 86712 They made her drink whiskey
86795 91175 and then they tried to<br />take advantage of her.
91258 95387 She resisted, she kept her honor.
96722 99725 So they beat her like an animal.
101560 106523 When I went to the hospital,<br />her nose was broken,
106607 111070 her jaw was shattered,<br />held together by wire.
113280 116700 She couldn't even weep<br />because of the pain.
118744 122247 But I wept. Why did I weep?
124917 127252 She was the light of my life.
129213 130923 Beautiful girl.
134593 137554 Now she will never be beautiful again.
144103 145479 Sorry.
153779 158450 I went to the police,<br />like a good American.
158534 161203 These two boys were brought to trial.
162287 165082 The judge sentenced them<br />to three years in prison,
165165 167292 but suspended the sentence.
168460 173465 Suspended the sentence!<br />They went free that very day!
175759 179054 I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
179138 182641 Those two bastards, they smiled at me.
183892 189481 Then I said to my wife, " For justice,<br />we must go to Don Corleone."
194903 199283 Why did you go to the police?<br />Why didn't you come to me first?
199408 205497 What do you want of me? Tell me<br />anything, but do what I beg you to do.
205581 207249 What is that?
218385 220220 I want them dead.
231857 233650 That I cannot do.
234985 237488 I 'll give you anything you ask.
239782 245412 I've known you many years, but this<br />is the first time you've asked for help.
246580 251627 I can't remember the last time<br />you invited me for a cup of coffee.
252795 256548 Even though my wife is godmother<br />to your only child.
256632 261637 But let's be frank here.<br />You never wanted my friendship.
261720 265474 And you were afraid to be in my debt.
265557 267976 I didn't want to get into trouble.
269102 270729 I understand.
272231 275108 You found Paradise in America.
277402 282074 You made a good living, had police<br />protection and there were courts of law.
282157 284868 You didn't need a friend like me.
286411 290082 But now you come to me and say,
290165 292584 "Don Corleone, give me justice."
294503 297339 But you don't ask with respect.
297422 302135 You don't offer friendship. You don't<br />even think to call me Godfather.
303846 310727 You come on my daughter's wedding<br />day and ask me to murder for money.
310811 313355 I ask you for justice.
313438 316441 That is not justice.<br />Your daughter is alive.
317484 320946 Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.
323073 325367 How much shall I pay you?
340048 343969 Bonasera, Bonasera.
344052 348140 What have I ever done to make you<br />treat me so disrespectfully?
349266 351810 If you'd come in friendship,
351894 356315 the scum that ruined your daughter<br />would be suffering this very day.
357441 362613 And if an honest man like you should<br />make enemies, they'd be my enemies.
365532 368368 And then they would fear you.
371872 373999 Be my friend?
377961 379504 Godfather?
383842 385052 Good.
387179 392351 Some day, and that day may never<br />come, I 'll ask a service of you.
393727 395854 But until that day
397648 401944 accept this justice as a gift<br />on my daughter's wedding day.
402027 404446 <i>- Gràzie, Godfather.<br />- Prego.</i>
411495 414206 Give this to Clemenza.
416500 419962 I want people that aren't going to<br />get carried away.
420045 424216 We're not murderers,<br />in spite of what this undertaker says.
449491 452911 - Where's Michael?<br />- Don't worry, he'll be here.
454037 457124 We're not taking the picture<br />without Michael.
463463 465924 - What's the matter?<br />- It's Michael.
515599 517267 Don Barzini.
533575 536953 Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.
537037 539289 Paulie! More wine.
541124 546338 - You look terrific on the floor.<br />- Are you a dance judge or something?
546421 548673 Take a walk and do your job.
556431 559684 Sandra, watch the kids.<br />Don't let them run wild.
559768 562229 You watch yourself, all right?
583375 587629 20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.
588588 590966 In that little silk purse.
591049 594636 <i>If this were somebody else's wedding…<br />Sfortunato!</i>
594719 595971 Hey, Paulie!
596054 599850 I got two gabagool, capocol,<br />and a prosciut.
599933 601017 Stupid jerk!
610152 612070 What's the matter?
624332 626918 - Have to go back to work.<br />- Tom.
627002 631256 No Sicilian can refuse any request<br />on his daughter's wedding day.
636970 642100 Don Corleone, I'm honored and<br />grateful that you have invited me.
646938 650150 Get out of here!<br />It's a private party. Go on!
651234 654196 What is it? It's my sister's wedding.
660785 663496 Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!
666499 669878 Come here, come here, come here!
684142 688688 …but towards the end, he was paroled<br />to help with the American war effort,
688772 691858 so for six months<br />he's worked in my pastry shop.
691942 694694 Nazorine, what can I do for you?
694778 696738 Now that the war is over,
696821 700825 this boy, Enzo, they want to<br />repatriate him back to Italy.
700909 705789 Godfather, I have a daughter.<br />You see, she and Enzo…
706998 711503 You want Enzo to stay in this country,<br />and your daughter to be married.
712671 714965 You understand everything.
715799 718176 Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
721304 725267 Wait till you see the wedding cake<br />I made for your daughter!
725350 728103 The bride, the groom and the angel…
733358 737904 - Who should I give this job to?<br />- Not to our paisan.
737988 743118 Give it to a Jew Congressman in<br />another district. Who else is on the list?
750166 751751 Hey, Michael!
771563 775025 He's not on the list,<br />but Luca Brasi wants to see you.
780864 783241 Is this necessary?
783325 787954 He didn't expect to be invited to the<br />wedding, so he wanted to thank you.
789289 794711 Don Corleone, I'm honored and<br />grateful that you have invited me
794794 797630 on the wedding day of your daughter.
797714 800133 May their first child<br />be a masculine child.
801343 802761 Michael…
804554 807932 That man over there<br />is talking to himself.
808016 810852 See that scary guy over there?
810935 814439 - He's a very scary guy.<br />- What's his name?
814522 819194 His name is Luca Brasi.<br />He helps my father out sometimes.
820987 823907 Michael, he's coming over here!
828244 830080 You look terrific!
830163 833458 My brother Tom Hagen,<br />Miss Kay Adams.
835210 837462 Your father's been asking for you.
837545 840382 - Very nice to meet you.<br />- Nice to meet you.
842133 844844 Why does your brother<br />have a different name?
844969 848807 My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen<br />in the street.
848890 852811 He had no home,<br />so my father took him in.
854562 857649 He's been with us ever since.
857732 859692 He's a good lawyer.
860527 865115 Not a Sicilian. I think<br />he's going to be consigliere.
865198 868118 - What's that?<br />- That's a,
868201 871996 like a counselor, an advisor.<br />Very important for the family.
872997 875166 You like your lasagna?
879421 881631 Don Corleone.
881714 884384 I'm honored and grateful
884467 888304 that you have invited me<br />to your daughter's wedding.
893309 896604 On the day of your daughter's wedding.
896688 901526 And I hope that their first child<br />will be a masculine child.
902944 908074 I pledge my ever -ending loyalty.
910034 915457 - For your daughter's bridal purse.<br />- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.
915540 920670 Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you<br />now, because I know you're busy.
921212 922547 Thank you.
972055 974390 Signora Corleone!
975600 978436 No!
1047547 1052635 Senator Cauley apologized for not<br />coming, but said you'd understand.
1052719 1056973 Also some of the judges.<br />They've all sent gifts.
1060018 1061227 What is that outside?
1070320 1074866 Johnny! Johnny!
1075908 1077577 I love you!
1087879 1091299 He came all the way from California.<br />I told you he'd come!
1091382 1094886 - He's probably in trouble again.<br />- He's a good godson.
1095887 1100224 Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!
1116240 1118660 You never said<br />you knew Johnny Fontane!
1118743 1122830 - Sure. You want to meet him?<br />- Great! Sure.
1122914 1126751 - My father helped him with his career.<br />- He did?
1126834 1127919 How?
1130463 1133299 - Let's listen to this song.<br />- Michael…
1166624 1168793 Please, Michael. Tell me.
1172296 1177343 When Johnny was starting out, he was<br />signed to a personal service contract
1177427 1180304 with a big bandleader.
1180430 1184642 And as his career got better and better,<br />he wanted to get out of it.
1185685 1188396 Johnny is my father's godson.
1188479 1191816 My father went to see this bandleader.
1191899 1195778 He offered him $ 10,000<br />to let Johnny go,
1195862 1198614 but the bandleader said no.
1198698 1204078 So the next day my father went to see<br />him, but this time with Luca Brasi.
1205830 1208082 Within an hour,
1208166 1213671 he signed a release<br />for a certified check of $ 1,000.
1215673 1219635 - How did he do that?<br />- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
1221304 1226184 - What was that?<br />- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,
1226309 1231522 and father said that either his brains or<br />his signature would be on the contract.
1236527 1238154 That's a true story.
1249582 1252251 That's my family, Kay. It's not me.
1264764 1266516 Beautiful!
1298756 1300883 I'll take care of it.
1300967 1302844 Tom…
1302927 1306639 I want you to find Santino.<br />Tell him to come to the office.
1313896 1316858 How are you, Fredo?
1316941 1319527 My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.
1320611 1322905 - Hi.<br />- How are you doing?
1324866 1329370 - This is my brother Mike.<br />- Are you having a good time?
1329453 1332039 Yeah. This is your friend?
1332123 1336794 I don't know what to do.<br />My voice is weak. It's weak.
1338504 1344969 Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,<br />it puts me right back on top again.
1345052 1350391 But this… man won't give it to me,<br />the head of the studio.
1350474 1353728 - What's his name?<br />- Woltz.
1353811 1357982 He won't give it to me,<br />and he says there's no chance.
1362236 1363529 Sonny?
1365156 1366324 Sonny?
1372747 1373998 Sonny?
1374832 1377585 - Sonny, are you in there?<br />- What?
1377668 1379545 The old man wants you.
1380796 1382506 One minute.
1396938 1401984 A month ago he bought the movie rights<br />to this book, a best -seller.
1402068 1405655 The main character<br />is a guy just like me.
1405738 1408407 I wouldn't even have to act.
1409367 1412203 Godfather, I don't know what to do.
1413496 1417792 You can act like a man!<br />What's the matter with you?
1417875 1423589 Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood<br />finocchio that cries like a woman?
1423673 1427718 "What can I do? What can I do?"<br />What is that nonsense?
1427802 1429512 Ridiculous.
1434225 1437353 - You spend time with your family?<br />- Sure I do.
1437436 1439063 Good.
1439105 1443818 Because a man who doesn't spend time<br />with his family can never be a real man.
1449448 1452910 You look terrible. I want you to eat.
1452994 1458290 Rest, and in a month this Hollywood<br />big shot will give you what you want.
1458374 1461502 It's too late,<br />they start shooting in a week.
1461585 1464755 I'm going to make him an offer<br />he can't refuse.
1467591 1472596 Just go outside and enjoy yourself,<br />and forget about all this nonsense.
1474765 1477810 - I want you to leave it all to me.<br />- All right.
1502877 1508174 - What time does my daughter leave?<br />- Soon, after they cut the cake.
1508257 1511886 Do we give your son -in -law<br />something important?
1511969 1517308 Never. Give him a living, but never<br />discuss the family business with him.
1517391 1520186 - What else?<br />- Virgil Sollozzo called.
1520311 1524732 - We'll have to see him next week.<br />- When you come back from California.
1526108 1529236 - When am I going to California?<br />- Tonight.
1529361 1534658 I want you to talk to this movie big shot<br />and settle this business for Johnny.
1535993 1540122 If there's nothing else, I 'd like to go<br />to my daughter's wedding.
1542291 1545252 Carlo, we're going to take the picture.
1546295 1548089 Wait a minute.
1548172 1550466 No, Michael. Not me.
1554970 1557848 Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!
1668000 1671170 - You need a little more heat on that arc.<br />- Start talking.
1671253 1674673 I was sent by a friend<br />of Johnny Fontane.
1674757 1678510 This friend would give<br />his friendship to Mr. Woltz,
1678594 1681430 if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.
1681513 1683849 Woltz is listening.
1683933 1688020 Give Johnny the part in that war film<br />you're starting next week.
1693734 1698739 And what favor would your friend<br />grant Mr. Woltz?
1698822 1702368 He could make your future union<br />problems disappear.
1702451 1706538 And one of your stars has just moved<br />from marijuana to heroin.
1706622 1710918 Are you trying to muscle me?<br />Listen, you son -of-a -bitch!
1711001 1713587 Let me lay it on the line.
1713671 1715673 Johnny Fontane<br />will never get that movie!
1715798 1720302 No matter how many Dago Guinea<br />greaseballs come out of the woodwork!
1720386 1724223 - I'm German -Irish.<br />- Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend.
1724306 1728686 - I'm going to make trouble for you!<br />- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened…
1728769 1732147 I know New York's big lawyers.<br />Who are you?
1732231 1735776 I have a special practice.<br />I handle one client.
1735859 1737861 I'll wait for your call.
1739613 1742574 By the way,<br />I admire your pictures very much.
1747371 1748872 Check him out.
1771395 1773939 - It's really beautiful.<br />- Look at this.
1774023 1778527 - It used to decorate a king's palace.<br />- Very nice.
1778610 1780988 Why didn't you say<br />you work for Corleone?
1781113 1785326 I thought you were some cheap hustler<br />Johnny was running in.
1785409 1788746 - I only use his name when necessary.<br />- How's your drink?
1788871 1792333 - Fine.<br />- Now I'll show you something beautiful.
1792416 1795002 You do appreciate beauty, don't you?
1797963 1801008 There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.
1801091 1805054 I bet Russian czars never paid<br />that for a single horse.
1805137 1806680 Khartoum.
1807306 1808599 Khartoum.
1810142 1814521 I'm not going to race him, though.<br />I'm going to put him out to stud.
1816106 1817649 Thanks, Tony.
1818442 1821362 Let's get something to eat.
1821445 1824865 Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
1824948 1829370 To the Italian people that's<br />a very sacred, close relationship.
1829453 1833374 I respect it.<br />Tell him to ask me anything else.
1833457 1835793 This favor I can't give him.
1835876 1839171 He never asks a second favor<br />when he's been refused the first.
1839296 1845427 You don't understand.<br />Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
1845511 1849181 That part is perfect for him.<br />It'll make him a big star.
1849306 1853394 I'm going to run him out of the business,<br />and let me tell you why.
1855396 1860067 Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz<br />International's most valuable protégés.
1860150 1865531 We trained her for five years.<br />Singing, acting, dancing lessons.
1865656 1870244 I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars<br />on her, to make her a big star.
1870327 1873122 Let me be even more frank.
1873205 1878210 To show you that I'm not a hard -hearted<br />man. That it's not all dollars and cents.
1878293 1881922 She was beautiful.<br />She was young and innocent!
1882005 1887428 She's the greatest piece of ass I've had<br />and I've had them all over the world.
1887511 1893642 Then Johnny Fontane comes along with<br />his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
1893725 1895436 And she runs off.
1896770 1900858 She threw it all away<br />just to make me look ridiculous!
1900941 1906113 And a man in my position can't afford<br />to be made to look ridiculous!
1906196 1908532 You get the hell out of here!
1908615 1912995 If that goombah tries any rough stuff,<br />tell him I'm no bandleader.
1914288 1917291 Yeah, I heard that story.
1918125 1922129 Thank you for dinner<br />and a very pleasant evening.
1922212 1925090 Maybe your car can take me<br />to the airport.
1925174 1928760 Mr. Corleone insists on hearing<br />bad news immediately.
2041456 2045377 - You're not too tired, are you, Tom?<br />- No, I slept on the plane.
2045460 2048547 I have the Sollozzo notes here.
2048630 2049881 Now…
2051842 2055429 Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
2055512 2057472 He's supposed to be very good<br />with a knife,
2057556 2061977 <i>but only in matters of business<br />with reasonable complaint.</i>
2062060 2065314 <i>His business is narcotics.</i>
2065397 2068775 <i>He has fields in Turkey,<br />where they grow poppy.</i>
2068859 2072696 <i>In Sicily he has plants<br />to process them into heroin.</i>
2072779 2076283 <i>He needs cash,<br />he needs protection from the police.</i>
2076366 2080287 <i>He'll give a piece of the action.<br />I don't know how much.</i>
2080412 2085626 <i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.<br />They have to be in it for something.</i>
2086918 2091506 - What about his prison record?<br />- One term in Italy, one here.
2091590 2094343 He's known as a top narcotics man.
2094426 2099097 - Santino, what do you think?<br />- A lot of money in that white powder.
2101433 2102809 Tom?
2102893 2107064 <i>Yes. There's more money in narcotics<br />than anything else.</i>
2107147 2111902 <i>If we don't get into it, somebody else<br />will, maybe the five families.</i>
2111985 2116448 With that money they can buy<br />more police and political power.
2116531 2118617 Then they come after us.
2118742 2125248 Now we have unions and gambling, and<br />that's great¤, but narcotics is the future.
2125332 2130462 If we don't get a piece of that action,<br />we risk everything in 10 years' time.
2135008 2138095 So? What's your answer<br />going to be, Pop?
2142849 2144601 Don Corleone.
2146687 2149981 I need a man who has powerful friends.
2150107 2152818 I need a million dollars in cash.
2152901 2158740 I need those politicians that you carry<br />in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.
2160200 2164204 - What is the interest for my family?<br />- 30%.
2164287 2168250 In the first year your end should be<br />three, four million dollars.
2168333 2170335 And then it would go up.
2171545 2174965 And what is the interest<br />for the Tattaglia family?
2176967 2178802 My compliments.
2182472 2185892 I'll take care of them, out of my share.
2185976 2190272 So I receive 30% for finance,
2190355 2193692 political influence and legal protection?
2193775 2195485 That's right.
2196778 2200699 Why do you come to me?<br />Why do I deserve this generosity?
2200782 2206079 If you consider a million dollars in cash<br />just finance,
2206163 2208331 te salud, Don Corleone.
2218842 2224097 I said that I would see you, because<br />I heard you were a serious man,
2224181 2226433 to be treated with respect.
2231104 2234399 But, I must say no to you.
2235567 2238403 And I'll give you my reason.
2238487 2241323 It's true,<br />I have a lot of friends in politics.
2242574 2246995 They wouldn't be friendly long if I was<br />involved in drugs instead of gambling,
2247078 2252709 which they regard as a harmless vice,<br />but drugs is a dirty business.
2252793 2257798 It doesn't make any difference to me<br />what a man does for a living.
2257881 2263136 But your business is… a little dangerous.
2263220 2267641 If you're worried about security,<br />the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
2267724 2271228 - The Tattaglias would guarantee our…<br />- Wait a minute.
2278527 2283323 I have a sentimental weakness<br />for my children, and I spoil them.
2283406 2286660 They talk when they should listen.<br />But anyway…
2286785 2292165 Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to<br />congratulate you on your new business.
2292249 2295710 I know you'll do well, and good luck.
2295794 2300632 Especially since your interests<br />don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
2321278 2323196 Santino.
2323280 2325115 Come here.
2327450 2329369 What's the matter with you?
2329452 2334082 Your brain is going soft<br />from playing with that girl.
2334165 2338295 Never tell anybody outside the family<br />what you're thinking again.
2339588 2340839 Go on.
2344801 2347637 Tom, what's this nonsense?
2347721 2351141 It's from Johnny.<br />He's starring in that new film.
2353476 2356062 - Take it away.<br />- Take it over there.
2357355 2358899 And
2359941 2362110 tell Luca Brasi to come in.
2368241 2371661 I'm a little worried<br />about this Sollozzo fellow.
2371745 2374706 Find out what he's got<br />under his fingernails.
2375707 2379336 Go to the Tattaglias.
2379419 2383715 Make them think that you're not<br />too happy with our family
2385091 2387469 and find out what you can.
2404945 2408239 I got something for your mother<br />and for Sonny
2408323 2412994 and a tie for Freddy,<br />and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.
2413078 2416331 - What do you want for Christmas?<br />- Just you.
2448238 2450156 <i>Andiamo, Fredo.</i>
2450240 2453660 - Tell Paulie to get the car.<br />- Okay, Pop.
2453743 2457747 I'll have to get it myself.<br />Paulie called in sick this morning.
2459499 2462752 Paulie's a good kid.<br />I don't mind getting the car.
2466172 2468341 <i>Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.</i>
2510967 2515263 - Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.<br />- I know.
2525190 2526191 You know who I am?
2526274 2527609 I know you.
2528902 2532489 You have been talking to the<br />Tattaglia family… right?
2533490 2537494 I think you and I can do business.
2539329 2541998 I need someone strong like you.
2542624 2545460 I heard you are not happy…
2545877 2548171 …with the Corleone family.
2548922 2550673 Want to join me?
2551841 2553802 What's in it for me?
2556429 2559349 $50,000 to start with.
2561351 2562602 Not bad!
2564270 2565897 Agreed?
2625331 2629043 Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
2629169 2634090 - Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.<br />- I haven't got time.
2634174 2637218 Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.
2639053 2643558 What are you worried about? If I wanted<br />to kill you, you'd be dead already.
2643641 2645101 Get in.
2656112 2659824 - Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.<br />- Okay, Pop.
2666623 2669459 Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.
2757005 2761050 Would you like me better<br />if I were a nun? Like in the story.
2764178 2765179 No.
2765263 2769642 - What if I were Ingrid Bergman?<br />- Now, that's a thought.
2772228 2774188 Michael.
2774272 2776691 No, I wouldn't like you better<br />if you were Ingrid Bergman.
2776774 2778568 What's the matter?
2795460 2798129 They don't say if he's dead or alive.
2820401 2823696 <i>- Sonny, it's Michael.<br />- Where have you been?</i>
2823780 2826532 <i>- Is he all right?<br />- We don't know yet.</i>
2826616 2830661 <i>There are all kinds of stories.<br />He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>
2832622 2835875 <i>- Are you there?<br />- Yeah, I'm here.</i>
2836000 2840880 <i>- Where have you been? I was worried.<br />- Didn't Tom tell you I called?</i>
2840963 2845009 <i>No. Look, come home, kid.<br />You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>
2852475 2854060 Oh, my God.
2858064 2859482 Sonny!
2868366 2870660 Stay back there.
2870743 2873413 - Who is it?<br />- Open up, it's Clemenza.
2875832 2879085 There's more news about your old man.
2879168 2881337 Word is out that he's already dead.
2881754 2885675 - What's the matter with you?<br />- Take it easy!
2885842 2889095 - Where was Paulie?<br />- Sick. He's been sick all winter.
2889178 2891597 - How often?<br />- Only three, four times.
2891681 2895476 - Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.<br />- Pick him up now.
2895560 2900398 I don't care how sick he is. Bring him<br />to my father's house right now.
2900481 2903568 - You want anyone sent over here?<br />- No. Go ahead.
2912743 2916747 I'm going to have a couple of our people<br />come over to the house.
2919667 2921836 <i>- Hello?<br />- Santino Corleone?</i>
2921919 2924755 <i>- Yeah.<br />- We have Tom Hagen.</i>
2924839 2928551 <i>In three hours he'll be released<br />with our proposition.</i>
2928634 2931971 <i>Listen to what he has to say<br />before you do anything.</i>
2932054 2936684 <i>What's done is done. Don't lose that<br />famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>
2936767 2938478 I'll wait.
2952825 2954827 Your boss is dead.
2957663 2962084 I know you're not in the muscle end<br />of the family, so don't be scared.
2963169 2967048 I want you to help the Corleones<br />and me.
2971010 2975515 We got him outside his office<br />about an hour after we picked you up.
2976933 2978226 Drink it.
2982980 2986442 It's up to you to make peace<br />between me and Sonny.
2990655 2993449 Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?
2994825 2997662 And you knew<br />it was the right thing to do.
2998829 3003960 - Sonny will come after you.<br />- That will be his first reaction, sure.
3005378 3011884 So you have to talk sense into him.<br />The Tattaglia family is behind me.
3011968 3017056 The other New York families will go<br />along with anything to prevent war.
3017139 3022353 Let's face it, with all due respect,<br />the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.
3025356 3028359 Ten years ago,<br />could I have gotten to him?
3032238 3036200 Well, now he's dead, Tom,<br />and nothing can bring him back.
3037994 3043874 You've got to talk to Sonny, to the<br />Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.
3048838 3050923 It's good business, Tom.
3052300 3057138 I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able<br />to call off Luca Brasi.
3060182 3061976 Yeah, well…
3063811 3066188 Let me worry about Luca.
3071402 3073779 You just talk to Sonny.
3073863 3076115 And the other two kids.
3079076 3081579 - I'll do my best.<br />- Good.
3083956 3086375 Now you can go.
3093215 3097887 I don't like violence, Tom.<br />I'm a businessman.
3097970 3100431 Blood is a big expense.
3121661 3123537 He's still alive.
3123621 3127583 They hit him with five shots,<br />and he's still alive!
3127667 3132421 That's bad luck for me, and bad luck<br />for you if you don't make that deal.
3177133 3181971 Your mother is at the hospital with<br />your father. Looks like he'll pull through.
3183806 3190438 It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip<br />Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon…
3190521 3193941 - You gonna kill all those guys?<br />- Stay out of it.
3194024 3196485 If you get rid of Sollozzo,<br />everything falls into line.
3196569 3200865 What about Luca?<br />Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
3200948 3204744 If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.
3204827 3208414 - Has anyone been in touch with Luca?<br />- We've been trying all night.
3208497 3212543 - Hey, do me a favor…<br />- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
3214628 3219842 Well, Tom, you're consigliere.<br />What do we do if the old man dies?
3220968 3227183 If we lose the old man, we lose the<br />political contacts and half our strength.
3227266 3232938 The other New York families might<br />support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
3233022 3237568 This is almost 1 946.<br />Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
3237651 3239320 If your father dies
3241739 3243491 you make the deal.
3243574 3248454 - Easy to say. He's not your father.<br />- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.
3253042 3254543 What is it?
3255544 3261342 - Paulie, I told you to stay put.<br />- The guy at the gates has a package.
3261425 3263552 Tessio, go see what it is.
3266889 3269141 - Shall I stay?<br />- Yeah. Are you all right?
3269225 3272978 - I'm fine.<br />- There's food. Are you hungry?
3273062 3276649 - No.<br />- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.
3276732 3279360 - Go ahead.<br />- That might be a good idea.
3281111 3287159 Take care of that son -of-a -bitch.<br />Paulie sold out the old man.
3287243 3290830 - Make that the first thing on your list.<br />- Understood.
3290913 3295209 Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys<br />and go to Luca's apartment.
3295292 3299004 Maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br />mixed up in this too directly.
3301549 3305261 Hanging around the house<br />on the phone would be a big help.
3306136 3308055 Try Luca again.
3316981 3319733 - What's this?<br />- A Sicilian message.
3319817 3322695 It means Luca Brasi<br />sleeps with the fishes.
3336417 3338502 - I'm going.<br />- When will you be home?
3338586 3340254 Probably late.
3342798 3346468 - Don't forget the cannoli!<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3348721 3353225 Rocco, sit on the other side.<br />You block the rear -view mirror.
3354768 3358188 Sonny's running wild. He wants<br />to go to mattresses already.
3358272 3364153 We have to find a spot on the<br />West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.
3364236 3367740 - Know a good spot on the West Side?<br />- I'll think about it.
3367823 3371577 Think while you're driving.<br />I want to hit New York this month.
3371660 3373412 Watch the kids.
3384298 3390095 Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up<br />18 mattresses and bring me the bill.
3390179 3391597 Yeah, all right.
3391680 3396101 Make sure they're clean, because<br />the guys will be there a long time.
3396185 3400439 - They're clean and exterminated.<br />- That's a bad word to use.
3400522 3404485 Exterminate! Watch out,<br />so we don't exterminate you!
3411200 3413702 Pull over. I've got to take a leak.
3455577 3458789 Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
3476974 3479852 Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!
3481770 3483897 - Yeah.<br />- Phone call!
3489945 3492156 - Who is it?<br />- Some girl.
3496452 3498871 <i>- Hello. Kay?<br />- How's your father?</i>
3498954 3500956 He's going to make it.
3501415 3503250 <i>I love you.</i>
3504668 3506295 I>I love you!
3507129 3509757 <i>- Michael?<br />- Yeah, I know.</i>
3509840 3512760 <i>- Tell me you love me.<br />- I can't talk.</i>
3512843 3514720 <i>Can't you say it?</i>
3515929 3517806 I'll see you tonight.
3518599 3521727 Why don't you tell that nice girl<br />you love her?
3521810 3526607 I love you with all my heart. If I don't<br />see you again soon, I'm going to die!
3527691 3532571 Come and learn something. You might<br />have to cook for 20 guys some day.
3532654 3536283 You start with a little oil,<br />then fry some garlic.
3536408 3542039 Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,<br />fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.
3542122 3546210 You get it to a boil, you shove in<br />all your sausage and meatballs.
3548087 3550172 Add a little bit of wine.
3553425 3557846 And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.
3557971 3562226 Cut the crap. I have more important<br />things for you. How's Paulie?
3562309 3564520 You won't see him no more.
3565979 3568482 - Where are you going?<br />- To the city.
3568565 3572069 - Send bodyguards with him.<br />- I'm going to the hospital…
3572152 3575489 He'll be all right.<br />Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.
3575572 3577574 - Be careful.<br />- Yes, sir.
3580702 3582996 Send somebody with him anyway.
3611066 3614111 - I have to go.<br />- Can I go with you?
3615904 3620242 No, Kay. There will be detectives there,<br />people from the press.
3620325 3622452 I'll wait in the cab.
3625080 3627708 I don't want you to get involved.
3630419 3632671 When will I see you again?
3639011 3643140 Go back to New Hampshire,<br />and I'll call you at your parents' house.
3644892 3649605 - When will I see you again, Michael?<br />- I don't know.
3781820 3785657 What are you doing here?<br />You're not supposed to be here.
3785741 3789244 I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.
3789328 3791663 What happened to the guards?
3791747 3797169 Your father had too many visitors.<br />They interfered with hospital service.
3797252 3800589 The police made them leave<br />about 10 minutes ago.
3805093 3809056 Get me Long Beach 45620, please.
3811600 3813935 Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
3817981 3822819 Sonny, I'm at the hospital.<br />I got here late, there's nobody here.
3822944 3827199 No Tessio's men,<br />no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.
3827282 3829785 <i>- Don't panic.<br />- I won't panic.</i>
3831244 3834122 I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.
3836833 3839669 We're going to move him<br />to another room.
3839753 3842756 Can you disconnect the tubes?
3842839 3846385 - That's out of the question!<br />- Do you know my father?
3846468 3850764 Men are coming here to kill him.<br />Do you understand?
3850847 3852641 Help me, please.
3929718 3933513 - Who are you?<br />- I am Enzo, the baker.
3934556 3936600 - Remember me?<br />- Enzo.
3936683 3939811 You'd better go,<br />there's going to be trouble.
3939895 3944524 If there is trouble, I'll stay here<br />to help you. For your father.
3946526 3950655 Listen. Wait for me outside,<br />in front of the hospital, all right?
3950739 3952824 I'll be out in a minute.
3966588 3970342 Just lie here, Pop.<br />I'll take care of you now.
3972302 3974346 I'm with you now.
3975972 3977516 I'm with you.
4012968 4015136 Get rid of these. Come here.
4016096 4020517 Put your hand in your pocket,<br />like you have a gun. You'll be all right.
4071860 4073528 You did good.
4122077 4125288 I thought all you Guinea hoods<br />were locked up!
4125413 4130001 - Why isn't anyone guarding my father?<br />- You little punk!
4130085 4134005 Don't you tell me my business!<br />I pulled them off.
4134130 4140053 - Stay away from this hospital!<br />- Not until my father's room is guarded.
4140887 4144182 - Phil, take him in!<br />- The kid's clean, Captain.
4144265 4148103 - He's a war hero. He's never been…<br />- I said take him in!
4150271 4156528 - What's The Turk paying you?<br />- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.
4156611 4158488 Stand him up straight.
4180635 4186266 I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men<br />are hired to protect Vito Corleone.
4186349 4188768 They're licensed to carry firearms.
4188852 4193273 If you interfere, you'll have to appear<br />before the judge and show cause.
4193356 4195358 Let him go.
4227766 4231686 - What's with all the new faces?<br />- We'll need them now.
4231770 4234647 After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.
4234731 4237901 We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.
4239027 4241029 Jesus Christ.
4247702 4250205 Looks like a fortress around here.
4252332 4257712 Tamaduch! Hey… 100 buttonmen<br />on the street 24 hours a day.
4257796 4261382 That Turk shows one hair on his ass,<br />he's dead.
4263426 4265512 Mike, let me look at you.
4269557 4272602 You're beautiful, beautiful.<br />You're gorgeous.
4272727 4278316 The Turk wants to talk!<br />Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.
4278399 4281152 - He wants a meeting today.<br />- What did he say?
4281277 4286074 What did he say… He wants us to send<br />Michael to hear the proposition.
4286157 4289619 He promises that the deal<br />is too good to refuse.
4289702 4292789 - And Bruno Tattaglia?<br />- That's part of the deal.
4292872 4297168 - He cancels out what they did to Father.<br />- We should listen to them.
4297252 4300380 No more! Not this time, Consigliere.
4300463 4304008 No more meetings, discussions,<br />or Sollozzo tricks.
4304092 4307136 I want Sollozzo, or we go to war…
4307220 4310181 - The other families…<br />- They hand me Sollozzo!
4310265 4312559 This is business, not personal!
4312642 4317063 - They shot my father…<br />- Even that was business, not personal.
4317981 4321734 Then business will have to suffer.<br />Do me a favor.
4321818 4325822 No more advice on how<br />to patch things up. Just help me win.
4332120 4336040 I found out about Captain McCluskey,<br />who broke Mike's jaw.
4336124 4340420 He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,<br />and for big money.
4340503 4344549 McCluskey has agreed<br />to be The Turk's bodyguard.
4344632 4348386 So when Sollozzo is being guarded,<br />he's invulnerable.
4348469 4352056 Nobody has ever gunned down<br />a New York police captain.
4352181 4358104 All the families would come after you.<br />The Corleone family would be outcasts!
4358187 4362025 Even the old man's political protection<br />would run for cover.
4363318 4367155 Do me a favor.<br />Take this into consideration.
4370992 4372994 All right, we'll wait.
4378416 4381252 We can't wait. We can't wait.
4382712 4386674 No matter what Sollozzo says,<br />he's going to kill Pop.
4386758 4390470 That's the key for him.<br />We've got to get Sollozzo.
4390553 4394849 - Mike is right.<br />- Let me ask you something.
4394933 4399520 What about this McCluskey?<br />What do we do with this cop?
4404692 4407570 They want to have a meeting<br />with me, right?
4408446 4412867 It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.
4414869 4416871 Let's set the meeting.
4419040 4422752 Get our informers to find out<br />where it's going to be held.
4424587 4428383 We insist it's a public place.<br />A bar, a restaurant.
4428466 4432220 Some place where there are people,<br />so I feel safe.
4434973 4437976 They'll search me<br />when I meet them, right?
4438059 4440395 So I can't have a weapon on me.
4443773 4448736 But if Clemenza can figure out a way to<br />have a weapon planted there for me
4453700 4455910 then I'll kill them both.
4468006 4472719 Nice college boy. Didn't want to<br />get mixed up in the family business.
4472844 4476472 Now you want to shoot a police captain<br />because he slapped you?
4476597 4483104 This isn't like the army! You have to get<br />close and get their brains on your suit.
4483187 4486232 You're taking this very personal.
4486315 4489736 Tom, this is business<br />and he's taking it personal.
4489861 4493322 - Where does it say you can't kill a cop?<br />- Mikey…
4493448 4499537 I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up<br />in drugs, a dishonest cop.
4500580 4504876 A cop who got mixed up in the rackets<br />and got what was coming.
4505001 4509547 That's a terrific story. We have<br />newspaper people on the payroll, right?
4511007 4514844 - They might like a story like that.<br />- They might.
4518514 4522101 It's not personal, Sonny.<br />It's strictly business.
4525313 4526856 It's as cold as they come.
4526939 4530193 Impossible to trace,<br />so you don't worry about prints.
4530610 4534655 I put a special tape on the trigger<br />and the butt. Try it.
4546834 4548920 Is the trigger too tight?
4552256 4553466 My ears!
4553549 4558179 I left it noisy, so it scares away any<br />pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.
4559347 4562266 You've shot them both.<br />Now what do you do?
4564644 4568314 - Sit down, finish my dinner.<br />- Don't fool around.
4568397 4571943 Let your hand drop to your side<br />and let the gun slip out.
4572026 4576447 Everybody will still think you've got it.<br />They'll stare at your face,
4576531 4579408 so walk out fast, but don't run.
4579492 4582912 Don't look anybody in the eye,<br />but don't look away either.
4582995 4586499 They'll be scared stiff,<br />so don't worry about nothing.
4588543 4592797 You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,<br />nobody knows where,
4592880 4594966 and we'll catch the hell.
4595591 4599428 - How bad do you think it will be?<br />- Pretty goddamn bad.
4599512 4602557 All the other families will probably<br />line up against us.
4602682 4608229 These things have to happen every five,<br />10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.
4608354 4612775 Been 10 years since the last one.<br />You have to stop them at the beginning.
4612900 4618614 Like they should have stopped Hitler in<br />Munich, not letting him get away with it.
4620032 4624537 You know, Mike, we were all proud<br />of you. Being a hero and all.
4624620 4626330 Your father too.
4664410 4667830 Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
4668789 4673044 Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br />where the meeting will be held.
4673127 4675463 How much time do we have?
4676339 4681135 They're going to pick you up outside<br />Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
4682136 4687016 - We could put a tail on them.<br />- Sollozzo would lose our ass.
4688392 4692939 - What about the negotiator?<br />- He's playing pinochle with my men.
4693064 4698152 - He's happy. They're letting him win.<br />- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
4698236 4701614 The negotiator plays cards<br />until Mike is back safe.
4701697 4705743 - He could blast whoever is in the car.<br />- They'll expect that.
4705826 4709163 Sollozzo might not even be<br />in the car, Sonny!
4709247 4710748 I'll get it.
4736023 4738192 Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
4738276 4741612 - Is it reliable?<br />- My man in McCluskey's precinct.
4741737 4747451 A police captain is on call 24 hours<br />a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.
4747535 4752415 - Anybody know this joint?<br />- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.
4752498 4757461 A small family place, good food.<br />Everyone minds his business. Perfect.
4758212 4763384 They've got an old -fashioned toilet.<br />You know, the box and the chain thing.
4765386 4768472 We might be able to<br />tape the gun behind it.
4768556 4772685 All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,
4772768 4776647 you eat, talk for a while, you relax.<br />Make them relax.
4776731 4782069 Then you go to take a leak. No,<br />better still, you ask permission to go.
4782153 4786615 Then you come back blasting.<br />Two shots in the head apiece.
4788367 4790870 I want somebody very good<br />to plant that gun.
4790953 4794457 I don't want him coming out<br />with just his dick.
4794540 4800087 - The gun will be there.<br />- You drive him and pick him up.
4800171 4801839 Let's move.
4807345 4810514 Did he tell you to drop the gun<br />right away?
4810598 4812475 Yeah, a million times.
4817229 4821442 Don't forget. Two shots apiece<br />in the head as soon as you come out.
4828032 4831619 How long do you think it will be<br />before I can come back?
4832453 4834538 At least a year.
4834663 4839460 I'll square it with Mom, that you're not<br />seeing her before you leave and…
4841003 4844840 I'll get a message to that girlfriend<br />when the time is right.
4850679 4852181 Take care.
4854975 4856727 Take care, Mike.
4889552 4893347 I'm glad you came. I hope<br />we can straighten everything out.
4894557 4899645 It's not the way I wanted things to go.<br />It should never have happened.
4899770 4904066 I want to straighten everything out.<br />Don't want my father bothered again.
4904150 4907403 I swear on my children<br />that he won't be, Mike.
4908404 4911699 But you have to keep an open mind<br />when we talk.
4911782 4916203 I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.<br />You can't talk business with him.
4918080 4919748 He's a good kid.
4923836 4927214 I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.
4927298 4931385 I've got to frisk you, so turn around.<br />On your knees, facing me.
4936515 4941187 I guess I'm getting too old for my job.<br />Too grouchy.
4942605 4946442 Can't stand the aggravation.<br />You know how it is.
4948736 4950154 He's clean.
4976764 4979058 Going to Jersey?
4981560 4983103 Maybe.
5008379 5010172 Nice work, Lou.
5047334 5052881 - How's the food in this restaurant?<br />- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.
5052965 5054633 I'll have it.
5090210 5093380 - I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.<br />- Go ahead.
5173001 5174670 What I want…
5175629 5177798 What's most important to me
5180551 5184763 is that I have a guarantee.<br />No more attempts on my father's life.
5184847 5189601 What guarantees can I give you?<br />I'm the hunted one!
5189685 5193230 I missed my chance.<br />You think too much of me, kid.
5193313 5195149 I'm not that clever.
5196650 5198902 All I want is a truce.
5205451 5209288 I have to go to the bathroom.<br />Is it all right?
5210664 5213167 When you got to go, you got to go.
5218672 5220591 He's clean.
5220674 5222760 Don't take too long.
5225888 5227681 I've frisked a thousand punks.
5518305 5520307 Okay, you take over.
5537574 5539409 I love you, Grandpa.
5542329 5545040 I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.
5546374 5549461 - Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.<br />- Okay.
5549586 5555842 "I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish<br />I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."
5558845 5561139 Go with your mother.
5561223 5563350 Take them downstairs.
5569481 5571525 Go on, Carlo, you too.
5573235 5574945 Go on.
5595549 5599553 - What's the matter with you, Carlo?<br />- Shut up and set the table.
5615110 5621158 Since McCluskey's killing, the police<br />have cracked down on our operations.
5622909 5627789 And also the other families.<br />There's been a lot of bad blood.
5627873 5631376 They hit us, so we hit them back.
5632210 5636756 Through our newspaper contacts<br />we've been able to put out material
5636840 5641136 about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo<br />in the drug rackets.
5641219 5643346 So things are loosening up.
5644598 5649352 And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,
5649436 5651980 under the protection<br />of Don Francesco of L.A.
5652105 5656610 - I want him to rest.<br />- I'm going to learn the casino business.
5664951 5666745 Where's Michael?
5679049 5682177 It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
5683970 5687807 But he's safe. We're starting to work<br />to bring him back.
5709204 5711641 I want you to find out<br />where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
5711665 5713625 I want him now.
5717337 5722050 If you go after Tattaglia, all hell<br />will break loose. Pop can negotiate.
5722133 5728139 - He must get better first. I'll decide…<br />- War is costly. We can't do business.
5728223 5732060 - Neither can they. Don't worry about it!<br />- We can't afford a stalemate.
5732185 5737107 - No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!<br />- You're getting a great reputation!
5737232 5743280 Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime<br />consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!
5743363 5745657 Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
5749244 5751538 I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
5752706 5755667 Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.
5756584 5760964 Niggers are having a good time<br />with our policy banks in Harlem.
5761047 5765218 Driving new Cadillacs,<br />paying 50% on a bet.
5765302 5768638 That's because<br />they've started making big money.
5768722 5772017 Papa never talked business<br />at the table.
5772100 5775979 - Shut up, Connie…<br />- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.
5776730 5777814 Don't interfere.
5780108 5784029 I 'd like to talk to you after dinner.<br />I could do more for the family…
5784112 5786906 We don't discuss business at the table.
5834120 5836748 I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
5842295 5844297 Why are you so far<br />from the house?
5844964 5847634 You know I'm responsible to your<br />father for your life.
5847717 5849010 The bodyguards are here.
5849928 5851262 It's still dangerous…
5852389 5854140 We've heard from Santino<br />in New York…
5855558 5857811 Your enemies know you're here.
5859813 5861564 Did Santino say when<br />I can go back?
5862232 5863525 Not yet.
5864192 5866027 It's out of the question.
5869489 5870907 Where are you going now?
5872575 5873618 To Corleone.
5874244 5875495 Take my car.
5878832 5879874 I want to walk.
5882502 5883670 Be careful.
5918204 5919581 Where have all the men gone?
5920623 5922834 They're all dead from vendettas.
5924461 5926880 There are the names of the dead.
5943271 5947400 Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!
5947484 5951779 Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!<br />Clark Gable!
5951905 5957160 America! Take me to the America, G. I.!<br />Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!
5975094 5977138 Mamma mia what a beauty.
5985313 5988399 I think you got hit<br />by the thunderbolt.
5994614 5998618 In Sicily women are more<br />dangerous than shotguns.
6021307 6023476 Did you have a good hunt?
6024435 6026813 You know all the girls<br />around here?
6027313 6028815 We saw some real beauties.
6029649 6033152 One of them struck our friend<br />like a thunderbolt.
6036364 6039117 She would tempt the devil himself.
6046749 6048918 Really put together.
6049002 6050044 Right, Calo?
6053798 6055800 Such hair, such mouth!
6058177 6061347 The girls around here are<br />beautiful… but virtuous.
6061889 6064267 This one had a purple dress…
6064642 6066769 And a purple ribbon in her hair.
6073234 6075069 Do you know her?
6079490 6082285 There's no girl like that<br />in this town.
6084996 6086205 My God, I understand!
6090335 6091336 What's wrong?
6093546 6094922 Let's go.
6096883 6098134 It's his daughter.
6098593 6100094 Tell him to come here.
6103514 6104849 Call him.
6124911 6127246 Fabrizio, you translate.
6131376 6133252 I apologize if I offended you.
6134253 6137674 I'm a stranger in this country.
6137757 6140843 I meant no disrespect<br />to you or your daughter.
6146307 6149185 I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.
6150603 6152939 My name is Michael Corleone.
6154982 6159112 There are people who'd pay<br />a lot of money for that information.
6161280 6164325 But then your daughter<br />would lose a father
6165910 6168287 instead of gaining a husband.
6176462 6178673 I want to meet your daughter.
6179340 6183928 With your permission, and under<br />the supervision of your family.
6184595 6186264 With all respect.
6192311 6196315 Come to my house Sunday morning.<br />My name is Vitelli.
6201821 6203322 What's her name?
6378664 6380833 I'll knock you dizzy.
6386589 6388674 Save it for the library.
6392345 6395014 We've got to pick up my sister.
6413074 6414784 What's the matter?
6417244 6419038 What's the matter?
6420831 6422750 - It was my fault!<br />- Where is he?
6422833 6426003 It was my fault. I hit him.
6426087 6429882 I started a fight with him.<br />I hit him, so he hit me…
6435096 6438391 I'm just going to get a doctor<br />to take a look at you.
6438474 6440977 Sonny, please don't do anything.
6442937 6445022 What's the matter with you?<br />What am I going to do?
6445106 6447984 Make that baby an orphan<br />before he's born?
6452530 6455741 You spic slobs still betting Yankees?
6455825 6458494 Tell them to stop taking in action.
6459328 6461038 We lost enough money last week.
6468170 6470214 Come here, come here!
6527146 6530483 If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.
6763716 6767970 Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.<br />You should call.
6768053 6772391 Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.
6772474 6776312 - I want to reach Michael.<br />- Nobody knows where he is.
6776395 6778939 All we know is that he's all right.
6781483 6785112 - What was that?<br />- An accident, but nobody was hurt.
6786238 6790367 Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.<br />Please?
6791910 6797082 If I accepted that, a court could prove<br />I have knowledge of his whereabouts.
6798083 6799960 He'll get in touch with you.
6800085 6803756 I let my cab go,<br />so can I call another one, please?
6803839 6805716 Come on. Sorry.
6822941 6827613 <i>- Hello?<br />- Is Carlo there?</i>
6828405 6830866 <i>- Who is this?<br />- A friend of Carlo.</i>
6830949 6834328 <i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight<br />until later.</i>
6840084 6841335 Bitch!
6843337 6846131 - Dinner's on the table.<br />- I'm not hungry.
6846215 6849551 - The food is getting cold.<br />- I'll eat out later.
6849635 6853013 <i>- You just told me to make you dinner!<br />- Vafangool!</i>
6853222 6855349 I'll vafangoolyou!
6860187 6862981 She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.
6867319 6871657 That's it, break it all,<br />you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!
6880874 6884002 Why don't you bring<br />your whore home for dinner?
6885003 6886672 Maybe I will.
6893429 6896598 - Clean it up!<br />- Like hell I will!
6896682 6900602 You skinny, spoiled brat.<br />Clean it up! Clean it up!
6900686 6905190 Clean it up! I said, clean it up!<br />Clean it up!
6905274 6910112 Clean it up. Clean that up, you…
6913365 6915075 Clean it!
6915159 6919413 Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.<br />Be a murderer, like your father!
6919496 6922958 - All you Corleones are murderers!<br />- I hate you!
6923041 6924751 Come on, kill me!
6926295 6927963 Get out of here!
6928046 6931467 - I hate you!<br />- Now I'll kill you.
6931550 6934219 You Guinea brat. Get out of here!
6944688 6947649 Connie, what's the matter?<br />I can't hear you.
6948775 6951820 Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.
6951904 6954823 Santino, I can't understand.<br />I don't know.
6956116 6957910 Yeah, Connie.
6962581 6964541 You wait there.
6967169 6969713 No, you just wait there.
6971882 6974134 Son -of-a -bitch.
6974218 6977429 - Son -of-a -bitch!<br />- What's the matter?
6981600 6984686 Open the goddamn gate!<br />Get off your ass.
6992694 6993946 Sonny!
7000410 7002412 - Sonny.<br />- Get out of here!
7003497 7005374 Go after him, go on!
7035112 7037155 Son -of-a -bitch. Come on!
7145847 7147683 Give me a drop.
7156108 7158402 My wife is crying upstairs.
7160779 7163281 I hear cars coming to the house.
7167953 7170872 <i>Consigliere of mine,</i>
7170956 7174459 tell your Don<br />what everyone seems to know.
7174543 7176920 I didn't tell Mama anything.
7177879 7181133 I was about to come up and wake you<br />and tell you.
7184636 7186847 But you needed a drink first.
7189182 7190434 Yeah.
7193729 7196231 Well, now you've had your drink.
7201778 7205657 They shot Sonny on the causeway.<br />He's dead.
7222716 7225260 I want no inquiries made.
7229723 7232267 I want no acts of vengeance.
7233977 7236813 I want you to arrange a meeting
7237814 7240442 with the heads of the five families.
7242360 7244446 This war stops now.
7266384 7268929 Call Bonasera.
7269012 7271181 I need him now.
7283568 7288740 This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling<br />for Vito Corleone, at his request.
7288824 7291201 You owe your Don a service.
7291284 7294830 <i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>
7294913 7299251 <i>He will be at your funeral parlor<br />in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>
7320438 7325235 Well, my friend, are you ready<br />to do me this service?
7325318 7328405 Yes. What do you want me to do?
7345422 7348341 I don't want his mother<br />to see him this way.
7364357 7367485 Look how they massacred my boy.
7396514 7399768 It's safer to teach you English!
7400518 7401937 I know English…
7402020 7406816 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,<br />Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.
7414032 7415825 Greetings, Don Tommasino.
7416534 7418536 How are things in Palermo?
7424542 7428588 Michael is teaching me to<br />drive… watch, I'll show you.
7431383 7433218 How are things in Palermo?
7433593 7436721 Young people don't respect<br />anything anymore…
7437806 7441184 times are changing for the worse.
7443436 7446856 This place has become<br />too dangerous for you.
7449567 7454739 I want you to move to a villa<br />near Siracusa… right now.
7460745 7461913 What's wrong?
7463039 7465250 Bad news from America.
7467711 7471423 Your brother, Santino,<br />they killed him.
7478013 7479848 Let's go… you promised.
7498658 7499659 Fabrizio!
7499743 7501161 Get the car.
7502537 7506708 Are you driving yourself, Boss?<br />Is your wife coming with you?
7506791 7510378 No, take her to her father's house<br />until things are safe.
7510462 7512380 Okay, anything you say.
7518303 7520055 Calo, where is Apollonia?
7520805 7524309 She's going to surprise you.<br />She wants to drive.
7526603 7528646 She'll make a good American wife.
7530106 7532650 Wait, I'll get the baggage.
7542911 7545080 Fabrizio!
7545163 7546831 Where are you going?
7548541 7550960 Wait there! I'll drive to you.
7557092 7558510 No, Apollonia!
7581574 7587413 Don Barzini, I want to thank you<br />for helping me organize this meeting,
7587539 7592377 and the other heads of the five families<br />from New York and New Jersey.
7594129 7597257 Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,
7597340 7600677 and from Brooklyn
7602303 7604389 Philip Tattaglia.
7606182 7608893 And from Staten Island
7608977 7612480 we have with us Victor Strachi.
7612564 7618194 And the other associates that came as<br />far as from California and Kansas City
7618278 7622031 and all the other territories<br />of the country. Thank you.
7628872 7632333 How did things ever get so far?
7632417 7634043 I don't know.
7636087 7639591 It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.
7642719 7646139 Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.
7648600 7652020 We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,
7652103 7656107 then I'm willing to let things go on<br />as before.
7657567 7661196 We're grateful to Don Corleone<br />for calling this meeting.
7661279 7666659 We all know him as a man of his word.<br />A modest man who listens to reason.
7666743 7670830 Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.
7670914 7675126 He had all the judges and politicians<br />in his pocket.
7675210 7678087 He refused to share them.
7678171 7681966 When did I ever refuse<br />an accommodation?
7682050 7684427 All of you know me.
7685345 7690516 When did I ever refuse,<br />except one time? And why?
7692185 7698024 Because I believe this drug business<br />will destroy us in the years to come.
7698107 7702362 It's not like gambling or liquor<br />or even women,
7702445 7708409 which is something that most people<br />want, but is forbidden by the Church.
7708534 7713248 Even the police that have helped us in<br />the past with gambling and other things
7713331 7717543 are going to refuse to help us<br />when it comes to narcotics.
7717627 7722757 I believed that then<br />and I believe that now.
7722840 7725051 Times have changed.
7725176 7729889 It's not like the old days,<br />when we could do anything we wanted.
7729973 7732850 A refusal is not the act of a friend.
7732934 7738356 If Don Corleone had all the judges and<br />politicians, then he must share them
7738439 7743027 or let others use them. He must let us<br />draw the water from the well.
7744112 7747699 Certainly he can present a bill<br />for such services.
7747782 7750368 After all, we're not communists.
7753496 7756582 I also don't believe in drugs.
7756708 7761546 For years I paid my people extra, so<br />they wouldn't do that kind of business.
7761629 7764757 Somebody says to them<br />" I have powders."
7764841 7768094 "If you put up<br />3 -4,000 dollar investment,
7768386 7771180 we can make 50,000 distributing."
7772390 7778313 They can't resist. I want to control it<br />as a business, keep it respectable.
7778396 7783192 I don't want it near schools,<br />I don't want it sold to children.
7783276 7785069 <i>That's an infàmia.</i>
7786404 7790325 In my city we would keep the traffic<br />to the colored.
7790408 7793619 They're animals,<br />so let them lose their souls.
7800251 7803838 I hoped that we could come here<br />and reason together.
7805256 7811888 And I'm willing to do whatever is<br />necessary to find a peaceful solution.
7812430 7817018 We are agreed. The traffic in drugs<br />will be permitted, but controlled.
7817101 7821397 Don Corleone will give us protection<br />in the east, and there will be peace.
7821481 7825234 I must have strict assurance<br />from Corleone.
7825318 7828613 As time goes by<br />and his position becomes stronger,
7828696 7831366 will he attempt any individual vendetta?
7831449 7836579 We are all reasonable men.<br />We don't have to give assurances.
7836662 7839540 You talk about vengeance.
7839624 7842877 Will vengeance<br />bring your son back to you?
7842960 7845505 Or my boy to me?
7845588 7848383 I forgo the vengeance of my son.
7851177 7853471 But I have selfish reasons.
7855765 7859352 My youngest son was forced<br />to leave this country
7861229 7863773 because of this Sollozzo business.
7865316 7869237 And I have to make arrangements<br />to bring him back here safely.
7869320 7871989 Cleared of all these false charges.
7873408 7876536 But I'm a superstitious man.
7876661 7881958 If an unlucky accident should befall him,<br />if he should be shot by a police officer¤,
7883334 7886921 or if he should hang himself<br />in his jail cell,
7887004 7889882 or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,
7891175 7894762 then I'm going to blame<br />some of the people in this room.
7896431 7898766 And that I do not forgive.
7901227 7903604 But, that aside
7906691 7909026 let me say that I swear
7910653 7913781 on the souls of my grandchildren,
7913865 7918244 that I will not be the one to break<br />the peace we've made here today.
7943728 7949192 Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's<br />drug middlemen have clean records?
7949275 7951402 Mention it. Don't insist.
7953404 7958326 - Barzini will know without being told.<br />- You mean Tattaglia.
7959952 7961913 Tattaglia's a pimp.
7962997 7966125 He could never have outfought Santino.
7968503 7974091 But I didn't know until this day<br />that it was Barzini all along.
7989565 7991651 Come on, Nancy.
7992860 7995446 Keep together, everyone. Brian.
7996781 7998449 Okay, all right.
8011546 8013756 How long have you been back?
8014549 8016384 I've been back a year.
8017802 8019929 Longer than that, I think.
8022765 8024934 It's good to see you, Kay.
8035987 8038531 I'm working for my father now, Kay.
8041033 8044036 He's been sick. Very sick.
8045580 8047540 But you're not like him.
8047623 8051419 You told me you weren't going to<br />become like your father.
8053337 8057633 My father is no different<br />than any other powerful man.
8057717 8061178 Any man who's responsible<br />for other people.
8062388 8064807 Like a senator or president.
8064890 8067351 - How naive you sound.<br />- Why?
8067435 8070271 They don't have men killed.
8073691 8075693 Who's being naive, Kay?
8076944 8081198 My father's way of doing things is over.<br />Even he knows that.
8082742 8087121 In five years the Corleone family<br />is going to be completely legitimate.
8088956 8092918 Trust me. That's all I can tell you<br />about my business. Kay…
8094378 8097506 Michael, why did you come here? Why?
8098799 8103638 What do you want with me after all<br />this time? I've been calling and writing.
8103721 8107224 I came because I need you.<br />I care for you.
8107308 8111145 - Please stop it, Michael.<br />- Because… I want you to marry me.
8112855 8115441 - It's too late.<br />- Please, Kay…
8117193 8121072 I'll do anything you ask<br />to make up for what's happened to us.
8122740 8126994 Because that's important, Kay.<br />Because what's important is that
8128537 8131791 we have each other.<br />That we have a life together.
8133376 8136087 That we have children. Our children.
8137588 8139757 Kay, I need you.
8141717 8143302 And I love you.
8165449 8169203 Barzini's people chisel my territory<br />and we do nothing about it!
8169328 8172957 - Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!<br />- Be patient.
8173040 8176168 I'm not asking for help.<br />Just take off the handcuffs.
8176252 8179380 - Be patient.<br />- We must protect ourselves.
8179463 8182925 - Let me recruit some new men.<br />- No.
8183008 8186887 - Barzini would get an excuse to fight.<br />- Mike, you're wrong.
8188389 8190558 Don Corleone…
8190641 8194770 You once said that one day Tessio<br />and me could form our own family.
8194854 8198899 Till today I would never think of it.<br />I must ask your permission.
8199900 8202570 Michael is now head of the family.
8202653 8206949 If he gives his permission,<br />then you have my blessing.
8207032 8209410 After we make the move to Nevada
8209493 8213914 you can leave the Corleone family<br />and go on your own.
8213998 8218335 - How long will that be?<br />- Six months.
8218419 8221672 Forgive me, but with you gone,
8221756 8224592 me and Pete<br />will come under Barzini's thumb.
8224675 8230347 I hate that Barzini. In six months' time<br />there will be nothing left to build on.
8230431 8233350 - Do you have faith in my judgment?<br />- Yes.
8233434 8236353 - Do I have your loyalty?<br />- Always, Godfather.
8236437 8239690 Then be a friend to Michael.<br />Do as he says.
8244612 8249950 Things are negotiated that'll solve your<br />problems and answer your questions.
8250034 8252369 That's all I can tell you now.
8253204 8255790 Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
8255873 8259251 When we make our move there,<br />you'll be my right -hand man.
8259335 8264131 Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.<br />He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
8264215 8266759 That's no reflection on Tom,<br />just how I want it.
8266842 8271555 If I ever need help, who's a better<br />consigliere than my father? That's it.
8291575 8295412 - Thank you, Papa.<br />- I'm happy for you, Carlo.
8295496 8298415 Mike… Why am I out?
8299917 8302628 You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.
8303921 8307174 Things may get rough with the move.
8307258 8308551 Tom.
8313722 8318894 I advised Michael. I never thought<br />you were a bad consigliere.
8318978 8323107 I thought Santino was a bad Don,<br />rest in peace.
8324567 8327778 Michael has all my confidence,<br />just as you do.
8328779 8333742 But there are reasons why you must<br />have no part in what is going to happen.
8334785 8337830 - Maybe I could help.<br />- You're out, Tom.
8387004 8391300 I can't get over the way your face looks.<br />So good!
8391425 8396013 This doctor did some job.<br />Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!
8396096 8400225 Leave them out here.<br />He's tired and wants to clean up.
8400309 8402686 Let me open the door, all right?
8408859 8414281 - Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!<br />- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.
8414365 8416992 - Your brother Freddy.<br />- Girls?
8420913 8423999 I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.
8425209 8428712 - Anything you want, kid, anything.<br />- Who are the girls?
8430130 8433550 - That's for you to find out.<br />- Get rid of them, Fredo.
8435094 8439765 - Hey, Mike…<br />- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.
8439848 8442518 I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.
8448399 8451694 Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.
8451777 8453904 Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.
8455614 8457741 Hey, come on! Scram!
8459410 8462955 Come on, honey. I don't know<br />what's the matter with him, Johnny.
8463038 8464331 Sorry.
8466291 8468836 I don't know. He's tired.
8479013 8483350 He had some business. He said to<br />give him a call when the party started.
8483434 8485394 Well, give him a call.
8486770 8489898 - Johnny, how are you?<br />- Nice to see you, Mike.
8489982 8492192 - We're proud of you.<br />- Thanks.
8492276 8495863 Sit down, I want to talk to you.<br />The Don is proud too.
8495946 8498198 Well, I owe it all to him.
8499408 8500993 He knows how grateful you are.
8501076 8504329 That's why<br />he'd like to ask a favor of you.
8504413 8506331 Mike, what can I do?
8507499 8509960 We're thinking of giving up our interests
8510044 8512963 in the olive oil business<br />and settling here.
8513797 8519136 Moe will sell us his share of the casino<br />and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.
8519219 8521972 - Tom!<br />- Are you sure?
8522056 8525059 Moe loves the business.<br />He never said nothing about selling.
8525142 8527853 I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
8529146 8531565 See, Johnny…
8531648 8535861 We figure that entertainment<br />would draw gamblers to the casino.
8535944 8539698 We hope you'll sign a contract<br />to appear five times a year.
8542618 8547247 Perhaps convince some of your friends<br />in the movies to do the same.
8548499 8550626 We're counting on you.
8552628 8556298 Sure, Mike.<br />I'll do anything for my godfather.
8556381 8557674 Good.
8559301 8563931 Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.<br />Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
8564014 8566558 - Good to see you.<br />- How are you, Moe?
8566683 8571772 Have everything? Specially prepared<br />food, the best dancers, and good credit.
8571855 8575442 Draw chips for everybody,<br />so they can play on the house.
8578112 8580864 Is my credit good enough<br />to buy you out?
8582616 8584451 Buy me out?
8584535 8587121 The casino, the hotel.
8587204 8590124 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy you out.
8590207 8595629 The Corleone family wants<br />to buy me out? No, I buy you out.
8595712 8599133 Your casino loses money.<br />We can do better.
8599216 8603095 - You think I'm skimming off the top?<br />- You're unlucky.
8607891 8610310 You Guineas make me laugh.
8610435 8615023 I took Freddy in when you had a bad<br />time, and now you try to push me out!
8616400 8619820 You did that<br />because we bankrolled your casino
8619903 8625159 and the Molinari family guaranteed<br />his safety. Let's talk business.
8625242 8627995 Yes. First of all, you're all done.
8628078 8630539 You don't have<br />that kind of muscle anymore.
8630664 8635043 The Godfather is sick. You're getting<br />chased out of New York by the others.
8635127 8639047 Do you think you can come to my hotel<br />and take over?
8639131 8644178 I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal<br />with him and still keep my hotel!
8644261 8647764 Is that why you slapped my brother<br />around in public?
8647848 8652686 That was nothing, Mike.<br />Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
8652769 8656982 He flies off the handle sometimes,<br />but we're good friends.
8657065 8661820 I have a business to run.<br />I've got to kick asses sometimes.
8665866 8668702 You straightened my brother out?
8668785 8673248 He was banging cocktail waitresses!<br />Players couldn't get a drink.
8673332 8675292 What's wrong with you?
8680172 8683300 I leave for New York tomorrow.<br />Think about a price.
8684218 8685844 Son -of-a -bitch!
8685928 8691099 I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones<br />when you were out with cheerleaders.
8691183 8693685 Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.
8694811 8698357 <i>Tom, you're the consigliere.<br />Talk to the Don…</i>
8698482 8703862 Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and<br />Mike is in charge of the family business.
8703946 8707282 If you have anything to say,<br />say it to Michael.
8712162 8717000 Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and<br />talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
8717751 8718961 Fredo…
8720170 8722923 You're my older brother, and I love you.
8724383 8728387 But don't ever take sides with anyone<br />against the family again.
8729888 8730889 Ever.
8739022 8743193 I have to see my father and his people,<br />so have dinner without me.
8744945 8749825 This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to<br />the city, see a show and have dinner.
8757207 8760252 Your sister wants to ask you something.
8760335 8762462 - Let her ask.<br />- She's afraid to.
8762546 8765507 They want you to be godfather<br />to their boy.
8765590 8767426 - We'll see.<br />- Will you?
8767509 8769845 Let me think about it. Come on.
8778729 8781606 Barzini will move against you first.
8781690 8786111 He'll set up a meeting with someone<br />you absolutely trust.
8786194 8788238 Guaranteeing your safety.
8789489 8792576 And at that meeting<br />you'll be assassinated.
8797289 8800292 I like to drink wine more than I used to.
8801710 8805213 - Anyway, I'm drinking more.<br />- It's good for you, Pop.
8810260 8811762 I don't know.
8813805 8816725 Are you happy with your wife<br />and children?
8817684 8820520 - Very happy.<br />- That's good.
8822397 8827277 I hope you don't mind the way I keep<br />going over this Barzini business.
8827361 8830322 - No, not at all.<br />- It's an old habit.
8831782 8834785 I spend my life trying not to be careless.
8836328 8839790 Women and children can be careless,<br />but not men.
8843126 8845462 - How's your boy?<br />- He's good.
8845587 8848298 He looks more like you every day.
8851009 8855472 He's smarter than I am. He's three<br />and can read the funny papers.
8857599 8859643 Read the funny papers.
8866858 8872489 I want you to arrange for a telephone<br />man to check all in - and out -going calls.
8872614 8877911 - I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.<br />- That's right. I forgot.
8881957 8883667 What's the matter?
8884501 8886545 What's bothering you?
8890132 8894761 I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,<br />so I'll handle it.
8908024 8912529 I knew that Santino<br />would have to go through all this.
8912612 8914239 And Fredo…
8916950 8918994 Fredo was, well…
8920871 8923707 But I never wanted this for you.
8926042 8931089 I worked my whole life. I don't apologize<br />for taking care of my family.
8931173 8935093 And I refused to be a fool,
8935177 8939306 dancing on a string<br />held by all those big shots.
8941266 8944728 I don't apologize. That's my life,<br />but I thought that,
8946396 8951568 that when it was your time, you would<br />be the one to hold the strings.
8953361 8959034 Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.<br />Something.
8959117 8962120 <i>Another pezzonovante.</i>
8962204 8963872 Well…
8967083 8971004 Just wasn't enough time, Michael.<br />Wasn't enough time.
8971087 8974591 We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.
8979429 8983892 Now listen, whoever comes to you<br />with this Barzini meeting,
8983975 8986937 he's the traitor. Don't forget that.
9003912 9006039 Can I hold it, please?
9021137 9025016 - Can I water these?<br />- Yes, go ahead.
9025100 9027894 Over here, over here.
9029771 9032274 Be careful. You're spilling it.
9038655 9040407 Anthony!
9040490 9042158 Come here, come here.
9047330 9050000 That's it. We'll put it right there.
9055213 9057799 I'll show you something. Come here.
9059843 9061720 Stand there.
9065473 9067225 Give me an orange!
9085577 9087370 That's a new trick.
9088371 9090707 You run in there. Run in there.
9104262 9106222 Where are you?
9283900 9286277 Mike, can I have a minute?
9296371 9298832 Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
9298915 9302210 He says we can straighten out<br />any of our problems.
9302877 9305088 - You talked to him?<br />- Yeah.
9306422 9310218 I can arrange security. On my territory.
9313263 9315807 - All right?<br />- All right.
9333324 9336286 Do you know<br />how they're going to come at you?
9338788 9342458 They're arranging a meeting<br />in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
9344627 9346421 Where I'll be safe.
9358683 9362270 I always thought it would be Clemenza,<br />not Tessio.
9362353 9366149 It's the smart move.<br />Tessio was always smarter.
9368401 9369694 But I'm going to wait.
9370361 9371362 After the baptism.
9375241 9378828 I've decided to be godfather<br />to Connie's baby.
9378912 9383082 And then I'll meet<br />with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
9384667 9387629 All the heads of the five families.
9528603 9533566 Michael, do you believe in God, the<br />Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?
9533649 9534817 I do.
9534901 9538404 <i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,<br />His only Son, our Lord?</i>
9538488 9539489 <i>I do.</i>
9539572 9543618 <i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,<br />the Holy Catholic Church?</i>
9543701 9544994 <i>I do.</i>
9610560 9614897 Michael Francis Rizzi,<br />do you renounce Satan?
9621154 9622405 I do renounce him.
9632081 9633499 And all his works?
9647388 9648431 I do renounce them.
9650183 9651434 Oh, God!
9654353 9658024 - And all his pomps?<br />- I do renounce them.
9678085 9679295 I will.
9686427 9691933 Michael Rizzi, go in peace,<br />and may the Lord be with you. Amen.
9706155 9708074 Kay!
9708157 9710117 Kiss your godfather.
9734517 9738604 Can't go to Vegas.<br />Something's come up.
9738688 9740356 Everybody has to leave without us.
9740439 9743401 - Mike, it's our first vacation!<br />- Connie, please.
9743526 9747029 Go back to the house, wait for my call.<br />It's important.
9748155 9750533 I'll only be a couple of days.
9766799 9769010 We're on our way to Brooklyn.
9771178 9774932 - I hope Mike can get us a good deal.<br />- I'm sure he will.
9782732 9788154 Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a<br />separate car, so you two go on ahead.
9788237 9791782 - That screws up my arrangements.<br />- That's what he said.
9791866 9794035 I can't go either, Sal.
9806005 9809925 Tell Mike it was only business.<br />I always liked him.
9811594 9814430 - He understands that.<br />- Excuse me, Sal.
9820436 9822897 Tom, can you get me off the hook?
9824065 9827234 - For old times' sake?<br />- Can't do it, Sally.
9872655 9875491 You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.
9880371 9884291 - Mike, you got it all wrong.<br />- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.
9885334 9889255 That little farce<br />you played with my sister.
9889338 9894427 - You think that could fool a Corleone?<br />- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.
9894510 9897221 - Please, don't do this.<br />- Sit down.
9899890 9902184 Don't do this to me, please.
9911444 9913195 Barzini is dead.
9915322 9917658 So is Philip Tattaglia.
9918868 9920369 Moe Greene.
9921328 9925124 Strachi. Cuneo.
9927084 9932339 Today I settle all family business,<br />so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
9932423 9934216 Admit what you did.
9938137 9939805 Get him a drink.
9946103 9947396 Come on.
9948731 9951150 Don't be afraid, Carlo.
9951233 9954111 Do you think<br />I 'd make my sister a widow?
9955237 9957948 I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.
9964872 9966916 Go ahead, drink, drink.
9971712 9975549 No, you're out of the family business.<br />That's your punishment.
9976634 9980596 You're finished.<br />I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.
9980679 9982306 Tom.
9986435 9990022 I want you to stay there. Understand?
9990105 9992691 Only don't tell me you're innocent.
9993943 9998197 Because it insults my intelligence.<br />Makes me very angry.
10002451 10004495 Who approached you?
10005788 10007998 Tattaglia or Barzini?
10015881 10017591 It was Barzini.
10021720 10023305 Good.
10029520 10033566 There's a car waiting outside<br />to take you to the airport.
10033649 10037194 I'll call your wife<br />and tell her what flight you're on.
10041490 10044034 - Mike…<br />- Get out of my sight.
10070185 10071812 Hello, Carlo.
10131664 10134792 - I'm trying to tell you…<br />- Mama, please!
10143175 10145260 Michael!
10145344 10147346 - What is it?<br />- Where is he?
10149765 10154895 Michael, you lousy bastard!<br />You killed my husband.
10154978 10159066 You waited until Papa died,<br />so nobody could stop you.
10159149 10162236 You blamed him for Sonny.<br />Everybody did.
10162319 10168117 But you never thought about me!<br />Now what are we going to do?
10168200 10169827 Connie.
10172079 10174790 Why do you think<br />he kept Carlo at the Mall?
10174873 10177710 He knew he was going to kill him.
10177793 10183132 And you stood godfather to our baby.<br />You lousy cold -hearted bastard!
10183215 10187302 Want to know how many men he had<br />killed with Carlo? Read the papers!
10187386 10190139 That's your husband,<br />that's your husband!
10199815 10204027 No! No, no…
10204111 10207489 Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.
10228635 10230345 She's hysterical.
10234892 10236643 Hysterical.
10238645 10240355 Michael, is it true?
10242357 10246028 - Don't ask me about my business, Kay.<br />- Is it true?
10246111 10248864 Don't ask me about my business.<br />Enough!
10268926 10270427 All right.
10273263 10275015 This one time.
10278977 10282314 This one time<br />I'll let you ask me about my affairs.
10288403 10289822 Is it true?
10293909 10295410 Is it?
10297162 10298539 No.
10312469 10315430 I guess we both need a drink. Come on.
10346712 10348422 Don Corleone.
