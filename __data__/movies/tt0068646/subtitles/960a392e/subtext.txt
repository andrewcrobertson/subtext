2541492 2544085 You want Scotch? Pre-war!
2544546 2545977 I don't drink.
2552241 2553418 I know you.
2553788 2557370 You have been talking to the<br />Tattaglia family... right?
2558727 2563802 I think you and I can do business.
2565002 2567461 I need someone strong like you.
2567939 2572958 I heard you are not happy<br />with the Corleone family.
2573428 2576962 Want to join me?
2577611 2579365 What's in it for me?
2580097 2583929 $50,000, to start with.
2587347 2588419 Not bad!
2589719 2590858 Agreed?
3429887 3431971 Hey, Paulie, did you fart?
5125054 5127013 - I'm sorry ab...<br />- It's alright.
5130654 5132774 You gotta know.
5132776 5137425 The hit taken out on your<br />father was just business.
5138132 5141439 Look. I have much<br />respect for your father.
5141441 5144451 But his thinking's outdated!
5146459 5151240 And you have to understand.<br />I am a man of honor.
5151242 5154471 I under...stand.
5155266 5156268 Very clearly...
5156270 5157612 I'm glad.
5169870 5175388 And you need to be clear wht I'm<br />working with the Tattaglia family.
5176966 5180752 All I want is peace.<br />Violence is costly.
5182080 5183868 As you well know.
5184547 5187129 Now let's stop this nonsense...
5187521 5189521 I want to... um...
5191366 5192366 What?
5194089 5195236 How do I say this...
5329154 5330313 You ok?
5332745 5335118 Okay, I want you to<br />understand something
5335120 5337037 You're Italian just like your father.
5339047 5341088 Your father's in bad shape.
5343260 5347234 Surely you can see that when he's<br />better he will need your help.
5347933 5349840 This fighting has to end.
5350928 5354564 You need to help me.<br />So we can end this...
5859475 5861205 I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
5868006 5869919 Why are you so far<br />from the house?
5870608 5873053 You know I'm responsible to<br />your father for your life.
5873055 5874546 The bodyguards are here.
5875425 5877937 It's still dangerous...
5877939 5880610 We've heard from Santino<br />in New York...
5881296 5883291 Your enemies know you're here.
5884226 5887728 Did Santino say<br />when I can go back?
5887730 5889347 Not yet.
5889349 5891886 It's out of the question.
5895307 5897279 Where are you going now?
5899434 5902009 Take my car.
5903227 5905764 I want to walk.
5908166 5909661 Be careful.
5943573 5945443 Where have all the men gone?
5945445 5947906 They're all dead from vendettas.
5949401 5952367 There are the names of the dead.
6000504 6002480 Mamma mia what a beauty.
6011649 6013875 I think you got hit<br />by the thunderbolt.
6020725 6023944 In Sicily, women are more<br />dangerous than shotguns.
6047542 6049097 Did you have a good hunt?
6049681 6052020 You know all the girls<br />around here?
6052022 6054560 We saw some real beauties.
6055103 6059232 One of them struck our<br />friend like a thunderbolt.
6061820 6065207 She would tempt the devil himself.
6065664 6067664 Tempt the devil...
6068446 6072181 Ah, I understand... really put together...
6072183 6074225 Really put together.
6075165 6076226 ...together
6079308 6081548 Such hair, such mouth!
6083489 6087119 The girls around here are<br />beautiful... but virtuous.
6087121 6089809 This one had a purple dress...
6089811 6092348 And a purple ribbon in her hair.
6092853 6096864 A type more Greek than Italian.
6098769 6100163 Do you know her?
6104749 6107871 There's no girl like<br />that in this town.
6110161 6112534 My God, I understand!
6115940 6116986 What's wrong?
6119785 6120935 Let's go.
6122664 6124089 It's his daughter.
6124090 6125473 Tell him to come here.
6125916 6128593 You don't understand... it's his daughter!
6128595 6130065 Call him.
6150325 6153181 Fabrizio, you translate for me.
6168973 6171636 Who is this? He sounds American...
6217892 6221583 Come to my house Sunday morning.<br />My name is Vitelli.
6227980 6229765 What's her name?
6284838 6288565 ...this is my daughter, Apollonia...
6288901 6292030 and this is Michael Corleone.
6309361 6310381 Thank you.
6311865 6313011 You're welcome.
6323769 6325707 What's the problem with your eye.
6325709 6327063 No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.
7423215 7425054 It's safer to teach you English!
7425567 7426918 I know English...
7439886 7442427 Greetings, Don Tommasino.
7442429 7443999 How are things in Palermo?
7450154 7455777 Michael is teaching me to<br />drive... watch, I'll show you.
7456504 7458042 How are things in Palermo?
7459322 7462194 Young people don't respect<br />anything any more...
7462410 7465296 times are changing for the worse.
7468952 7474593 This place has become<br />too dangerous for you.
7474595 7481925 I want you to move to a villa<br />near Siracusa... right now.
7485426 7486865 What's wrong?
7488231 7490858 Bad news from America.
7492068 7493610 Your brother, Santino,
7494851 7496418 they killed him.
7501262 7503301 Come on. Let's go.
7503303 7505379 Let's go... you promised.
7525863 7527442 Get the car.
7543895 7545871 Calo, where is Apollonia?
7546464 7549542 She's going to surprise you.<br />She wants to drive.
7552292 7555377 She'll make a good American wife.
7555990 7557747 Wait, I'll get the baggage.
7570685 7572082 Where are you going?
7573193 7576777 Wait there! I'll drive to you.
