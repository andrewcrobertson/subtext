51343 54131 I believe in America.
54221 57213 America has made my fortune.
57349 61559 And I raised my daughter<br />in the American fashion.
61645 66355 I gave her freedom, but I taught her<br />never to dishonor her family.
67734 70897 She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.
70988 75573 She went to the movies with him.<br />She stayed out late.
75659 77241 I didn't protest.
78370 82989 Two months ago he took her for a drive<br />with another boyfriend.
84042 86579 They made her drink whiskey
86712 91172 and then they tried to<br />take advantage of her.
91258 95422 She resisted, she kept her honor.
96555 99547 So they beat her like an animal.
101602 106597 When I went to the hospital,<br />her nose was broken,
106690 111025 her jaw was shattered,<br />held together by wire.
113280 116568 She couldn't even weep<br />because of the pain.
118577 122195 But I wept. Why did I weep?
124791 127249 She was the light of my life.
129212 130828 Beautiful girl.
134676 137634 Now she will never be beautiful again.
141266 142301 (COUGHS)
144019 145509 Sorry.
153654 158490 I went to the police,<br />like a good American.
158617 161200 These two boys were brought to trial.
162287 165029 The judge sentenced them<br />to three years in prison,
165123 167285 but suspended the sentence.
168502 173463 Suspended the sentence!<br />They went free that very day!
175634 179002 I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
179096 182680 Those two bastards, they smiled at me.
183809 189521 Then I said to my wife, "For justice,<br />we must go to Don Corleone."
194820 199314 VITO: Why did you go to the police?<br />Why didn't you come to me first?
199449 205536 What do you want of me? Tell me<br />anything, but do what I beg you to do.
205664 207246 What is that?
218385 220171 (WHISPERING) I want them dead.
231690 233681 That I cannot do.
234860 237477 I'll give you anything you ask.
239823 245364 I've known you many years, but this<br />is the first time you've asked for help.
246580 251620 I can't remember the last time<br />you invited me for a cup of coffee.
252836 256545 Even though my wife is godmother<br />to your only child.
256631 261626 But let's be frank here.<br />You never wanted my friendship.
261762 265426 And you were afraid to be in my debt.
265557 267798 BONASERA: I didn't want to<br />get into trouble.
268977 270763 I understand.
272147 274980 You found Paradise in America.
277360 281945 You made a good living, had police<br />protection and there were courts of law.
282032 284694 You didn't need a friend like me.
286369 289953 But now you come to me and say,
290040 292577 "Don Corleone, give me justice."
294461 297249 But you don't ask with respect.
297380 301999 You don't offer friendship. You don't<br />even think to call me Godfather.
303887 310805 You come on my daughter's wedding<br />day and ask me to murder for money.
310894 313352 BONASERA: I ask you for justice.
313438 316396 That is not justice.<br />Your daughter is alive.
317442 320776 Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.
322948 325280 How much shall I pay you?
339881 343795 Bonasera, Bonasera.
343885 348004 What have I ever done to make you<br />treat me so disrespectfully?
349182 351844 If you'd come in friendship,
351935 356224 the scum that ruined your daughter<br />would be suffering this very day.
357399 362610 And if an honest man like you should<br />make enemies, they'd be my enemies.
365490 368278 And then they would fear you.
371913 373824 Be my friend?
377794 379455 Godfather?
383884 384884 Good.
387053 392298 Some day, and that day may never<br />come, I'll ask a service of you.

1797921 1801004 There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.
1801133 1805092 I bet Russian czars never paid<br />that for a singe horse.
1805178 1806543 Khartoum.
1807347 1808462 Khartoum.
1810142 1814352 I'm not going to race him, though.<br />I'm going to put him out to stud.
1816106 1817517 Thanks, Tony.
1818275 1821188 Let's get something to eat.
1821320 1824779 TOM: Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
1824906 1829195 To the Italian people that's<br />a very sacred, close relationship.
1829328 1833162 I respect it.<br />Tell him to ask me anything else.
1833248 1835740 This favor I can't give him.
1835834 1839247 He never asks a second favor<br />when he's been refused the first.
1839379 1845295 You don't understand.<br />Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
1845385 1849253 That part is perfect for him.<br />It'll make him a big star.
1849389 1853223 I'm going to run him out of the business,<br />and let me tell you why.
1855228 1860143 Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz<br />International's most valuable prot√©g√©s.
1860233 1865444 We trained her for five years.<br />Singing, acting, dancing lessons.
1865572 1870362 I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars<br />on her, to make her a big star.
1870452 1873194 Let me be even more frank.
1873288 1878249 To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted<br />man. That it's not all dollars and cents.
1878377 1881961 She was beautiful.<br />She was young and innocent!
1882047 1887258 She's the greatest piece of ass I've had<br />and I've had them all over the world.
1887386 1893598 Then Johnny Fontane comes along with<br />his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
1893683 1895265 And she runs off.
1896686 1900850 She threw it all away<br />just to make me look ridiculous!
1900982 1906193 And a man in my position can't afford<br />to be made to look ridiculous!
1906279 1908441 You get the hell out of here!
1908573 1912988 If that goombah tries any rough stuff,<br />tell him I'm no bandleader.
1914329 1917287 Yeah, I heard that story.
1918208 1922247 Thank you for dinner<br />and a very pleasant evening.
1922337 1925125 Maybe your car can take me<br />to the airport.
1925257 1928841 Mr. Corleone insists on hearing<br />bad news immediately.
2016515 2018256 (WOLTZ SCREAMING)
2026441 2028432 (SCREAMING CONTINUES)
2041498 2045412 - You're not too tired, are you, Tom?<br />- No, I slept on the plane.
2045502 2048369 I have the Sollozzo notes here.
2048463 2049794 Now...
2051800 2055134 Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
2055220 2056927 He's supposed to be very good<br />with a knife,
2057430 2061970 <i>but only in matters of business<br />with reasonable complaint.</i>
2062060 2065394 <i>His business is narcotics.</i>
2065480 2068689 <i>He has fields in Turkey,<br />where they grow poppy.</i>
2068817 2072606 <i>In Sicily he has plants<br />to process them into heroin.</i>
2072696 2076405 <i>He needs cash,<br />he needs protection from the police.</i>
2076491 2080405 <i>He'll give a piece of the action.<br />I don't know how much.</i>
2080495 2085490 <i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.<br />They have to be in it for something.</i>
2086876 2091336 - What about his prison record?<br />- One term in Italy, one here.
2091464 2094081 He's known as a top narcotics man.
2094509 2099094 - Santino, what do you think?<br />- A lot of money in that white powder.
2101516 2102722 Tom?
2102851 2107061 <i>TOM: Yes. There's more money<br />in narcotics than anything else.</i>
2107147 2111857 <i>If we don't get into it, somebody else<br />will, maybe the five families.</i>
2111943 2116528 With that money they can buy<br />more police and political power.
2116656 2118522 Then they come after us.
2118658 2125280 Now we have unions and gambling, and<br />that's great, but narcotics is the future.
2125373 2130493 If we don't get a piece of that action,<br />we risk everything in 10 years' time.
2134924 2138042 So? What's your answer<br />going to be, Pop?
2142724 2144681 Don Corleone.
2146519 2149887 I need a man who has powerful friends.
2150065 2152682 I need a million dollars in cash.
2152776 2158567 I need those politicians that you carry<br />in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.
2160158 2164197 - What is the interest for my family?<br />- 30%.
2164329 2168288 In the first year your end should be<br />three, four million dollars.
2168375 2170332 And then it would go up.
2171586 2174874 And what is the interest<br />for the Tattaglia family?
2176883 2178669 My compliments.
2182555 2185798 I'll take care of them, out of my share.
2185934 2190223 So I receive 30% for finance,
2190397 2193560 political influence and legal protection?
2193692 2195524 That's right.
2196611 2200570 Why do you come to me?<br />Why do I deserve this generosity?
2200699 2206035 If you consider a million dollars in cash<br />just finance,
2206162 2208369 <i>te salud,</i> Don Corleone.
2218758 2224003 I said that I would see you, because<br />I heard you were a serious man,
2224139 2226426 to be treated with respect.
2231020 2234433 But, I must say no to you.
2235650 2238438 And I'll give you my reason.
2238570 2241278 It's true,<br />I have a lot of friends in politics.
2242657 2246946 They wouldn't be friendly long if I was<br />involved in drugs instead of gambling,
2247036 2252577 which they regard as a harmless vice,<br />but drugs is a dirty business.
2252667 2257628 It doesn't make any difference to me<br />what a man does for a living.
2257756 2263047 But your business is... a little dangerous.
2263178 2267718 If you're worried about security,<br />the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
2267849 2271217 - The Tattaglias would guarantee our...<br />- Wait a minute.
2278526 2283316 I have a sentimental weakness<br />for my children, and I spoil them.
2283448 2286736 They talk when they should listen.<br />But anyway...
2286868 2292079 <i>Signor</i> Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to<br />congratulate you on your new business.
2292207 2295745 I know you'll do well, and good luck.
2295877 2300667 Especially since your interests<br />don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
2321236 2323102 Santino.
2323238 2325024 Come here.
2327367 2329278 What's the matter with you?
2329369 2333954 Your brain is going soft<br />from playing with that girl.
2334082 2338167 Never tell anybody outside the family<br />what you're thinking again.
2339546 2340911 Go on.
2344843 2347631 Tom, what's this nonsense?
2347762 2350345 It's from Johnny.<br />He's starring in that new film.
2353434 2355892 - Take it away.<br />- Take it over there.
2357230 2358937 And
2359941 2361898 tell Luca Brasi to come in.
2368157 2371650 I'm a little worried<br />about this Sollozzo fellow.
2371786 2374369 Find out what he's got<br />under his fingernails.
2375748 2379241 Go to the Tattaglias.
2379377 2383746 Make them think that you're not<br />too happy with our family
2384966 2387424 and find out what you can.
2404777 2408145 I got something for your mother<br />and for Sonny
2408239 2412824 and a tie for Freddy,<br />and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.
2412952 2416240 - What do you want for Christmas?<br />- Just you.

2459457 2462745 Paulie's a good kid.<br />I don't mind getting the car.

2528943 2532402 (IN ITALIAN) You have been talking<br />to the Tattaglia family... right?

2963210 2967044 I want you to help the Corleones<br />and me.
2971010 2975379 We got him outside his office<br />about an hour after we picked you up.
2976932 2978297 Drink it.
2982980 2986518 It's up to you to make peace<br />between me and Sonny.
2990571 2993529 Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?
2994783 2997571 And you knew<br />it was the right thing to do.
2998787 3003827 - Sonny will come after you.<br />- That will be his first reaction, sure.
3005419 3011836 So you have to talk sense into him.<br />The Tattaglia family is behind me.
3011967 3017053 The other New York families will go<br />along with anything to prevent war.
3017181 3022392 Let's face it, with all due respect,<br />the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.
3025397 3028389 Ten years ago,<br />could I have gotten to him?
3032238 3036197 Well, now he's dead, Tom,<br />and nothing can bring him back.
3037868 3043784 You've got to talk to Sonny, to the<br />Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.
3048671 3050833 It's good business, Tom.
3052299 3057089 I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able<br />to call off Luca Brasi.
3060099 3061885 Yeah, well...
3063686 3066178 Let me worry about Luca.
3071360 3073226 You just talk to Sonny.
3073821 3075027 And the other two kids.
3079034 3081651 - I'll do my best.<br />- Good.
3083872 3086409 Now you can go.
3093215 3097800 I don't like violence, Tom.<br />I'm a businessman.
3097886 3100469 Blood is a big expense.
3121702 3123568 He's still alive.
3123704 3127538 They hit him with five shots,<br />and he's still alive!
3127625 3132370 That's bad luck for me, and bad luck<br />for you if you don't make that deal.
3177091 3181881 Your mother is at the hospital with your<br />father. Looks like he'll pull through.
3183681 3190428 It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip<br />Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...
3190562 3193805 MICHAEL: You gonna kill all those guys?<br />Stay out of it.
3193941 3196524 TOM: If you get rid of Sollozzo,<br />everything falls into line.
3196610 3200695 What about Luca?<br />Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
3200781 3204524 If Luca sold out,<br />we're in a lot of trouble.
3204618 3208407 Has anyone been in touch with Luca?<br />- We've been trying all night.
3208539 3209574 Hey, do me a favor...
3209707 3212540 TOM: Luca never sleeps over<br />with a broad.
3214628 3219623 Well, Tom, you're <i>consigliere.</i><br />What do we do if the on man dies?
3220801 3227138 If we lose the old man, we lose the<br />political contacts and half our strength.
3227224 3232810 The other New York families might<br />support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
3232938 3237557 This is almost 1946.<br />Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
3237651 3239233 If your father dies
3241780 3243487 you make the deal.
3243615 3248405 Easy to say. He's not your father.<br />- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.
3251623 3252784 (KNOCK ON DOOR)
3252875 3254582 What is it?
3255502 3261293 - Paulie, I told you to stay put.<br />- The guy at the gates has a package.
3261425 3263507 Tessio, go see what it is.
3266764 3269005 - Shall I stay?<br />SONNY: Yeah. Are you all right?
3269099 3272842 - I'm fine.<br />- There's food. Are you hungry?
3272978 3276642 - No.<br />- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.
3276732 3279269 - Go ahead.<br />- That might be a good idea.
3280986 3287073 Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.<br />Paulie sold out the old man.
3287201 3290364 - Make that the first thing on your list.<br />Understood.
3290621 3295115 Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys<br />and go to Luca's apartment.
3295250 3298868 Maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br />mixed up in this too directly.
3301548 3305212 Hanging around the house<br />on the phone would be a big help.
3306053 3307919 Try Luca again.
3316855 3319643 - What's this?<br />- TESSIO: A Sicilian message.
3319733 3322725 It means Luca Brasi<br />sleeps with the fishes.

3358188 3364059 We have to find a spot on the<br />West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.
3364152 3367816 - Know a good spot on the West Side?<br />- I'll think about it.
3367948 3371612 Think while you're driving.<br />I want to hit New York this month.
3371743 3373359 Watch the kids.
3384214 3385921 ROCCO: Paulie, go down 39th Street,
3386008 3390002 pick up 18 mattresses<br />and bring me the bill.
3390137 3391627 PAULIE: Yeah, all right.
3391763 3393094 ROCCO: Make sure they're clean,

4269557 4272720 You're beautiful, beautiful.<br />You're gorgeous.
4272810 4278305 The Turk wants to talk!<br />Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.
4278399 4281141 - He wants a meeting today.<br />- What did he say?
4281235 4285980 What did he say... He wants us to send<br />Michael to hear the proposition.
4286115 4289608 He promises that the deal<br />is too good to refuse.
4289702 4292694 - And Bruno Tattaglia?<br />- That's part of the deal.
4292789 4297033 - He cancels out what they did to Father.<br />- We should listen to them.
4297168 4300377 No more! Not this time, <i>Consigliere.</i>
4300463 4303831 No more meetings, discussions,<br />or Sollozzo tricks.
4303966 4307004 I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...
4307136 4310049 - The other families...<br />- They hand me Sollozzo!
4310181 4312593 This is business, not personal!
4312683 4316927 - They shot my father...<br />- Even that was business, not personal.
4317814 4321808 Then business will have to suffer.<br />Do me a favor.
4321901 4325860 No more advice on how<br />to patch things up. Just help me win.
4332036 4335950 I found out about Captain McCluskey,<br />who broke Mike's jaw.
4336040 4340409 He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,<br />and for big money.
4340503 4344497 McCluskey has agreed<br />to be The Turk's bodyguard.
4344632 4348296 So when Sollozzo is being guarded,<br />he's invulnerable.
4348427 4352011 Nobody has ever gunned down<br />a New York police captain.
4352098 4358014 All the families would come after you.<br />The Corleone family would be outcasts!
4358104 4361847 Even the old man's political protection<br />would run for cover.
4363276 4367065 Do me a favor.<br />Take this into consideration.
4370825 4372816 All right, we'll wait.
4378332 4381120 We can't wait. We can't wait.
4382712 4386706 No matter what Sollozzo says,<br />he's going to kill Pop.
4386841 4390459 That's the key for him.<br />We've got to get Sollozzo.
4390553 4394672 - Mike is right.<br />- SONNY: Let me ask you something.
4394807 4399472 What about this McCluskey?<br />What do we do with this cop?
4404692 4407525 They want to have a meeting<br />with me, right?
4408362 4412947 It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.
4414952 4416943 Let's set the meeting.
4418915 4422749 Get our informers to find out<br />where it's going to be held.
4424545 4428334 We insist it's a public place.<br />A bar, a restaurant.
4428466 4432084 Some place where there are people,<br />so I feel safe.
4435014 4437847 They'll search me<br />when I meet them, right?
4437934 4440301 So I can't have a weapon on me.
4443773 4448768 But if Clemenza can figure out a way to<br />have a weapon planted there for me

4476555 4482927 This isn't like the army! You have to get<br />close and get their brains on your suit.
4483020 4486138 You're taking this very personal.
4486232 4489770 Tom, this is business<br />and he's taking it personal.
4489860 4493319 - Where does it say you can't kill a cop?<br />- Mikey...
4493406 4499493 I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up<br />in drugs, a dishonest cop.
4500538 4504372 A cop who got mixed up in the rackets<br />and got what was coming.
4504917 4509286 That's a terrific story. We have<br />newspaper people on the payroll, right?
4510965 4514754 - They might like a story like that.<br />- They might.
4518431 4521924 It's not personal, Sonny.<br />It's strictly business.
4525021 4526682 CLEMENZA: It's as cold as they come.
4526814 4530227 Impossible to trace,<br />so you don't worry about prints.
4530359 4534398 I put a special tape on the trigger<br />and the butt. Try it.
4546834 4548916 Is the trigger too tight?
4552089 4553375 My ears!
4553466 4558051 I left it noisy, so it scares away any<br />pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.
4559263 4562096 You've shot them both.<br />Now what do you do?
4564602 4568220 - Sit down, finish my dinner.<br />- Don't fool around.
4568314 4571932 Let your hand drop to your side<br />and let the gun slip out.
4572068 4576312 Everybody will still think you've got it.<br />They'll stare at your face,
4576447 4579280 so walk out fast, but don't run.
4579408 4582901 Don't look anybody in the eye,<br />but don't look away either.
4583037 4586405 They'll be scared stiff,<br />so don't worry about nothing.
4588459 4592828 You'll be all right. You'll take<br />a vacation, nobody knows where,
4592922 4594959 and we'll catch the hell.
4595508 4599297 How bad do you think it will be?<br />- Pretty goddamn bad.
4599428 4602511 All the other families will probably<br />line up against us.

4616904 4618440 They were just asking for big trouble.
4620074 4624489 You know, Mike, we were all proud<br />of you. Being a hero and all.
4624578 4626160 Your father too.
4635131 4636246 (CLICKS)
4664285 4667778 Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
4668789 4673033 Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br />where the meeting will be held.
4673169 4675376 How much time do we have?
4676172 4681212 They're going to pick you up outside<br />Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
4682219 4685007 CLEMENZA: We could<br />put a tail on them.
4685139 4687005 Sollozzo would lose our ass.
4688225 4693015 - What about the negotiator?<br />- He's playing pinochle with my men.
4693147 4697937 - He's happy. They're letting him win.<br />- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
4698027 4701565 The negotiator plays cards<br />until Mike is back safe.
4701655 4705649 He could blast whoever is in the car.<br />- CLEMENZA: They'll expect that.
4705784 4708071 Sollozzo might not even be<br />in the car, Sonny!

4752373 4757288 A small family place, good food.<br />Everyone minds his business. Perfect.
4758295 4763210 They've got an old-fashioned toilet.<br />You know, the box and the chain thing.
4765219 4768382 We might be able to<br />tape the gun behind it.
4768472 4772636 All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,
4772726 4776594 you eat, talk for a while, you relax.<br />Make them relax.
4776689 4782105 Then you go to take a leak. No,<br />better still, you ask permission to go.
4782236 4786480 Then you come back blasting.<br />Two shots in the head apiece.
4788200 4790862 Miami somebody very good<br />to plant that gun.
4790953 4794287 I don't want him coming out<br />with just his dick.

4800254 4801744 Let's move.
4807386 4810344 Did he tell you to drop the gun<br />right away?
4810472 4812304 Yeah, a million times.

4827990 4831483 How long do you think it will be<br />before I can come back?
4832328 4834490 At least a year.
4834580 4839325 I'll square it with Mom, that you're not<br />seeing her before you leave and...
4840836 4844420 I'll get a message to that girlfriend<br />when the time is right.
4850554 4852170 Take care.
4854933 4856594 Take care, Mike.
4889301 4893295 I'm glad you came. I hope<br />we can straighten everything out.

5546332 5549495 - Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.<br />- Okay.
5549586 5555923 "I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish<br />I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."
5558845 5561007 Go with your mother.

5595465 5599459 - What's the matter with you, Carlo?<br />- Shut up and set the table.
5614984 5621026 Since McCluskey's killing, the police<br />have cracked down on our operations.
5622909 5627824 And also the other families.<br />There's been a lot of bad blood.
5627914 5631248 They hit us, so we hit them back.
5632043 5636788 Through our newspaper contacts<br />we've been able to put out material
5636881 5641000 about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo<br />in the drug rackets.
5641094 5643256 So things are loosening up.
5644597 5649262 And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,
5649394 5652102 under the protection<br />of Don Francesco of L.A.
5652230 5656599 - I want him to rest.<br />- I'm going to learn the casino business.
5664951 5666692 (SOFTLY) Where's Michael?
5679132 5682045 It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
5684053 5687842 But he's safe. We're starting to work<br />to bring him back.
5709078 5711558 I want you to find out<br />where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
5711664 5713575 I want him now.
5713708 5717121 Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.
5717253 5722123 If you go after Tattaglia, all hell<br />will break loose. Pop can negotiate.
5722217 5728133 He must get better first. I'll decide...<br />- War is costly. We can't do business.
5728223 5732182 - Neither can they. Don't worry about it!<br />- We can't afford a stalemate.
5732310 5737225 - No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!<br />- You're getting a great reputation!
5737357 5743148 Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime<br /><i>consigliere,</i> I wouldn't be in this shape!
5743279 5745566 Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
5749118 5751485 I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
5752622 5755580 Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.
5756542 5761002 Niggers are having a good time<br />with our policy banks in Harlem.
5761130 5765089 Driving new Cadillacs,<br />paying 50% on a bet.
5765176 5768589 That's because<br />they've started making big money.
5768721 5772055 Papa never talked business<br />at the table.
5772183 5776017 - CARLO: Shut up, Connie...<br />- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.
5776729 5777764 Don't interfere.
5780191 5784105 I'd like to talk to you after dinner.<br />I could do more for the family...
5784195 5786937 We don't discuss business at the table.

7698191 7702276 It's not like gambling or liquor<br />or even women,
7702361 7708357 which is something that most people<br />want, but is forbidden by the Church.
7708492 7713077 Even the police that have helped us in<br />the past with gambling and other things
7713164 7717499 are going to refuse to help us<br />when it comes to narcotics.
7717585 7722705 I believed that then<br />and I believe that now.
7722798 7725130 Times have changed.
7725218 7729928 It's not like the old days,<br />when we could do anything we wanted.
7730014 7732847 A refusal is not the act of a friend.
7732975 7738220 If Don Corleone had all the judges and<br />politicians, then he must share them
7738356 7743066 or let others use them. He must let us<br />draw the water from the well.
7744153 7747646 Certainly he can present a bill<br />for such services.
7747782 7750240 After all, we're not communists.
7753371 7756580 I also don't believe in drugs.
7756666 7761251 For years I paid my people extra, so<br />they wouldn't do that kind of business.
7761587 7764750 Somebody says to them<br />"I have powders."
7764840 7768253 "If you put up<br />3-4,000 dollar investment,
7768386 7770969 we can make 50,000 distributing."
7772223 7778219 They can't resist. I want to control it<br />as a business, keep it respectable.
7778354 7783099 I don't want it near schools,<br />I don't want it sold to children.
7783192 7785183 That's an <i>inf√†mia.</i>
7786362 7790230 In my city we would keep the traffic<br />to the colored.
7790366 7793575 They're animals,<br />so let them lose their souls.
7800334 7803827 I hoped that we could come here<br />and reason together.
7805339 7811881 And I'm willing to do whatever is<br />necessary to find a peaceful solution.
7812388 7817053 We are agreed. The traffic in drugs<br />will be permitted, but controlled.
7817143 7821307 Don Corleone will give us protection<br />in the east, and there will be peace.
7821439 7825103 I must have strict assurance<br />from Corleone.
7825192 7828605 As time goes by<br />and his position becomes stronger,
7828696 7831233 will he attempt any individual vendetta?
7831324 7836535 BARZINI: We are all reasonable men.<br />We don't have to give assurances.
7836662 7839495 You talk about vengeance.
7839623 7842911 Will vengeance<br />bring your son back to you?
7843044 7845411 Or my boy to me?
7845504 7848246 I forgo the vengeance of my son.
7851260 7853422 But I have selfish reasons.
7855723 7859216 My youngest son was forced<br />to leave this country
7861270 7863728 because of this Sollozzo business.
7865232 7869021 And I have to make arrangements<br />to bring him back here safely.
7869320 7871982 Cleared of all these false charges.
7873282 7876525 But I'm a superstitious man.
7876660 7881951 If an unlucky accident should befall him,<br />if he should be shot by a police officer,
7883250 7886959 or if he should hang himself<br />in his jail cell,
7887088 7889876 or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,
7891217 7894710 then I'm going to blame<br />some of the people in this room.
7896263 7898675 And that I do not forgive.
7901310 7903517 But, that aside,
7906607 7909099 let me say that I swear
7910528 7913691 on the souls of my grandchildren,
7913864 7918279 that I will not be the one to break<br />the peace we've made here today.
7943686 7949272 Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's<br />drug middlemen have clean records?
7949358 7951474 Mention it. Don't insist.
7953487 7958357 - Barzini will know without being told.<br />- You mean Tattaglia.
7959910 7961867 Tattaglia's a pimp.
7962955 7966118 He could never have outfought Santino.
7968335 7974081 But I didn't know until this day<br />that it was Barzini all along.
7989398 7991514 Come on, Nancy.
7992776 7995518 Keep together, everyone. Brian.
7996697 7998529 Okay, all right.
8011337 8013578 How long have you been back?
8014340 8016377 I've been back a year.
8017635 8019797 Longer than that, I think.
8022598 8024805 It's good to see you, Kay.
8035819 8038481 I'm working for my father now, Kay.
8040866 8043858 He's been sick. Very sick.
8045579 8047490 But you're not like him.
8047623 8051366 You told me you weren't going to<br />become like your father.
8053295 8057414 My father is no different<br />than any other powerful man.
8057550 8061168 Any man who's responsible<br />for other people.
8062388 8064675 Like a senator or president.
8064807 8067390 - How naive you sound.<br />- Why?
8067476 8070218 They don't have men killed.
8073482 8075473 Who's being naive, Kay?
8076610 8080899 My father's way of doing things is over.<br />Even he knows that.
8082616 8086826 In five years the Corleone family<br />is going to be completely legitimate.
8088622 8092581 Trust me. That's all I can tell you<br />about my business. Kay...
8094086 8097249 Michael, why did you come here? Why?
8098424 8103464 What do you want with me after all<br />this time? I've been calling and writing.
8103554 8106922 I came because I need you.<br />I care for you.
8107057 8110846 - Please stop it, Michael.<br />- Because... I want you to marry me.
8112438 8115226 - It's too late.<br />- Please, Kay...
8116859 8120727 I'll do anything you ask<br />to make up for what's happened to us.
8122531 8126866 Because that's important, Kay.<br />Because what's important is that
8128537 8131620 we have each other.<br />That we have a life together.
8133334 8135951 That we have children. Our children.
8137588 8139545 Kay, I need you.
8141508 8143249 And I love you.
8165366 8169155 TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel<br />my territory and we do nothing about it!
8169286 8172779 - Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!<br />- MICHAEL: Be patient.
8172915 8176078 TESSIO: I'm not asking for help.<br />Just take off the handcuffs.
8176168 8179331 MICHAEL: Be patient.<br />CARLO: We must protect ourselves.
8179421 8182755 - Let me recruit some new men.<br />- MICHAEL: No.
8182883 8186717 - Barzini would get an excuse to fight.<br />- TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.
8188305 8190546 CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...
8190683 8194517 You once said that one day Tessio<br />and me could form our own family.
8194645 8198684 Till today I would never think of it.<br />I must ask your permission.
8199692 8202559 Michael is now head of the family.
8202695 8206734 If he gives his permission,<br />then you have my blessing.
8206865 8209357 After we make the move to Nevada
8209493 8213703 you can leave the Corleone family<br />and go on your own.
8213789 8218204 - TESSIO: How long will that be?<br />- Six months.
8218335 8221418 Forgive me, but with you gone,
8221505 8224543 me and Pete<br />will come under Barzini's thumb.
8224633 8230219 I hate that Barzini. In six months' time<br />there will be nothing left to build on.
8230347 8233214 - Do you have faith in my judgment?<br />- Yes.
8233350 8236217 - Do I have your loyalty?<br />- Always, Godfather.
8236395 8239729 Then be a friend to Michael.<br />Do as he says.
8244570 8249781 Things are negotiated that'll solve your<br />problems and answer your questions.
8249908 8252240 That's all I can tell you now.
8253036 8255573 Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
8255706 8259119 When we make our move there,<br />you'll be my right-hand man.
8259209 8263954 Tom Hagen is no longer <i>consigliere.</i><br />He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
8264047 8266630 That's no reflection on Tom,<br />just how I want it.
8266759 8271469 If I ever need help, who's a better<br /><i>consigliere</i> than my father? That's it.
8291533 8295322 - Thank you, Papa.<br />- I'm happy for you, Carlo.
8295412 8298245 Mike... Why am I out?
8299625 8302583 You're not a wartime <i>consigliere,</i> Tom.
8303712 8307000 Things may get rough with the move.
8307132 8308463 Tom.
8313680 8318641 I advised Michael. I never thought<br />you were a bad <i>consigliere.</i>
8318769 8322933 I thought Santino was a bad Don,<br />rest in peace.
8324483 8327771 Michael has all my confidence,<br />just as you do.
8328695 8333690 But there are reasons why you must<br />have no part in what is going to happen.
8334785 8337823 Maybe I could help.<br />- You're out, Tom.
8347798 8349414 (DOOR CLOSING)
8386879 8391294 I can't get over the way your face looks.<br />So good!
8391425 8395840 This doctor did some job.<br />Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!
8395929 8400093 Leave them out here.<br />He's tired and wants to clean up.
8400225 8402637 Let me open the door, all right?
8403896 8406638 (PLAYING<br /><i>FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW)</i>
8408859 8414150 - Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!<br />- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.
8414281 8416739 JOHNNY: Your brother Freddy.<br />FREDO: Girls?
8420704 8423742 I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.
8425083 8428701 - Anything you want, kid, anything.<br />- Who are the girls?
8429963 8433456 - That's for you to find out.<br />Get rid of them, Fredo.
8434885 8439721 - Hey, Mike...<br />- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.
8439806 8442389 I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.
8448273 8451265 Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.
8451735 8453817 Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.
8455530 8457612 Hey, come on! Scram!
8459284 8462743 Come on, honey. I don't know<br />what's the matter with him, Johnny.
8462871 8464236 Sorry.
8466124 8468786 I don't know. He's tired.
8474299 8475710 (DOOR CLOSING)
8475801 8478668 What happened to Moe Greene?
8478762 8483222 He had some business. He said to<br />give him a call when the party started.
8483350 8485216 Well, give him a call.
8486645 8489854 - Johnny, how are you?<br />- Nice to see you, Mike.
8489982 8491973 MICHAEL: We're proud of you.<br />JOHNNY: Thanks.
8492109 8495852 Sit down, I want to talk to you.<br />The Don is proud too.
8495988 8497979 Well, I owe it all to him.
8499199 8500860 He knows how grateful you are.
8500951 8504160 That's why<br />he'd like to ask a favor of you.
8504246 8506157 Mike, what can I do?
8507374 8509911 We're thinking of giving up our interests
8510043 8512876 in the olive oil business<br />and settling here.
8513672 8518917 Moe will sell us his share of the casino<br />and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.
8519011 8521719 - Tom!<br />- Are you sure?
8521805 8524797 Moe loves the business.<br />He never said nothing about selling.
8524933 8527800 I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
8528854 8531437 See, Johnny...
8531565 8535684 We figure that entertainment<br />would draw gamblers to the casino.
8535819 8539608 We hope you'll sign a contract<br />to appear five times a year.
8542492 8547032 Perhaps convince some of your friends<br />in the movies to do the same.
8548373 8550489 We're counting on you.
8552502 8556086 Sure, Mike.<br />I'll do anything for my godfather.
8556214 8557579 Good.
8559092 8563882 Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.<br />Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
8564014 8566472 Good to see you.<br />- How are you, Moe?
8566600 8571686 Have everything? Specially prepared<br />food, the best dancers, and good credit.
8571813 8575272 Draw chips for everybody,<br />so they can play on the house.
8577861 8580728 Is my credit good enough<br />to buy you out?
8582491 8584277 Buy me out?
8584409 8586867 The casino, the hotel.
8586995 8589862 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy you out.
8589998 8595493 The Corleone family wants<br />to buy me out? No, I buy you out.
8595629 8598872 Your casino loses money.<br />We can do better.
8599007 8603092 - You think I'm skimming off the top?<br />- You're unlucky.
8607766 8610133 You Guineas make me laugh.
8610268 8614978 I took Freddy in when you had a bad<br />time, and now you try to push me out!
8616149 8619767 You did that<br />because we bankrolled your casino
8619903 8624943 and the Molinari family guaranteed<br />his safety. Let's talk business.
8625075 8627988 Yes. First of all, you're all done.
8628120 8630452 You don't have<br />that kind of muscle anymore.
8630539 8634874 The Godfather is sick. You're getting<br />chased out of New York by the others.
8634960 8638999 Do you think you can come to my hotel<br />and take over?
8639131 8643921 I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal<br />with him and still keep my hotel!
8644052 8647670 Is that why you slapped my brother<br />around in public?
8647764 8652554 That was nothing, Mike.<br />Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
8652686 8656930 He flies off the handle sometimes,<br />but we're good friends.
8657023 8661733 I have a business to run.<br />We got to kick asses sometimes.
8661820 8665688 We had an argument,<br />so I had to straighten him out.
8665782 8668570 You straightened my brother out?
8668702 8672991 He was banging cocktail waitresses!<br />Players couldn't get a drink.
8673123 8674989 What's wrong with you?
8680172 8682880 I leave for New York tomorrow.<br />Think about a price.
8682966 8684081 (DRINK SPILLING)
8684176 8685758 Son-of-a-bitch!
8685844 8691055 I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones<br />when you were out with cheerleaders.
8691183 8693550 Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.
8694644 8698182 Tom, you're the <i>consigliere.</i><br />Talk to the Don...
8698315 8703776 Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and<br />Mike is in charge of the family business.
8703862 8707025 If you have anything to say,<br />say it to Michael.
8710118 8711153 (DOOR SLAMMING)
8712204 8716949 Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and<br />talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
8717626 8718866 Fredo...
8720170 8722832 You're my older brother, and I love you.
8724174 8728168 But don't ever take sides with anyone<br />against the family again.
8729804 8731044 Ever.
8739022 8743186 I have to see my father and his people,<br />so have dinner without me.
8744903 8749693 This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to<br />the city, see a show and have dinner.
8757249 8760037 Your sister wants to ask you something.
8760168 8762284 - Let her ask.<br />- She's afraid to.
8762420 8765378 They want you to be godfather<br />to their boy.
8765465 8767251 - We'll see.<br />- Will you?
8767384 8769716 Let me think about it. Come on.
8778520 8781433 Barzini will move against you first.
8781523 8786063 He'll set up a meeting with someone<br />you absolutely trust.
8786152 8788234 Guaranteeing your safety.
8789281 8792319 And at that meeting<br />you'll be assassinated.
8797080 8800072 I like to drink wine more than I used to.
8801543 8805207 - Anyway, I'm drinking more.<br />- It's good for you, Pop.
8810302 8811667 I don't know.
8813722 8816589 Are you happy with your wife<br />and children?
8817600 8820388 - Very happy.<br />- That's good.
8822147 8827108 I hope you don't mind the way I keep<br />going over this Barzini business.
8827193 8830106 - No, not at all.<br />- It's an old habit.
8831698 8834656 I spend my life trying not to be careless.
8836119 8839703 Women and children can be careless,<br />but not men.
8843084 8845291 - How's your boy?<br />- He's good.
8845420 8848287 He looks more like you every day.
8850967 8855256 He's smarter I am. He's three<br />and can read the funny papers.
8857390 8859472 Read the funny papers.
8866775 8872361 I want you to arrange for a telephone<br />man to check all in- and out-going calls.
8872489 8875777 I did it already.<br />I took care of that, Pop.
8875867 8877858 That's right. I forgot.
8881873 8883534 What's the matter?
8884292 8886374 What's bothering you?
8890090 8894675 I'll handle it. I told you<br />I can handle it, so I'll handle it.
8907982 8912351 I knew that Santino<br />would have to go through all this.
8912487 8914228 And Fredo...
8916908 8918899 Fredo was, well...
8920787 8923575 But I never wanted this for you.
8925959 8931045 I worked my whole life. I don't apologize<br />for taking care of my family.
8931172 8935040 And I refused to be a fool,
8935176 8939340 dancing on a string<br />held by all those big shots.
8941266 8944554 I don't apologize. That's my life,<br />but I thought that,
8946396 8951391 that when it was your time, you would<br />be the one to hold the strings.
8953361 8958982 Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.<br />Something.
8959075 8962067 Another <i>pezzonovante.</i>
8962203 8963739 Well...
8967041 8971000 Just wasn't enough time, Michael.<br />Wasn't enough time.
8971087 8974455 We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.
8979512 8983847 Now listen, whoever comes to you<br />with this Barzini meeting,
8983933 8986846 he's the traitor. Don't forget that.
9003828 9005944 Can I hold it, please?
9021095 9024963 - Can I water these?<br />- Yes, go ahead.
9025099 9027761 Over here, over here.

9283733 9286191 Mike, can I have a minute?
9296329 9298616 Baum wants to arrange a meeting.
9298748 9302116 He says we can straighten out<br />any of our problems.
9302710 9304951 - You talked to him?<br />- Yeah.
9306380 9310123 I can arrange security. On my territory.
9313221 9315838 All right?<br />- All right.
9333241 9336233 Do you know<br />how they're going to come at you?
9338871 9342455 They're arranging a meeting<br />in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
9344669 9346376 Where I'll be safe.
9358683 9362176 I always thought it would be Clemenza,<br />not Tessio.
9362270 9366059 It's the smart move.<br />Tessio was always smarter.
9368317 9369682 But I'm going to wait.
9370278 9371313 After the baptism.
9375116 9378905 I've decided to be godfather<br />to Connie's baby.
9379036 9382904 And then I'll meet<br />with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
9384667 9387625 All the heads of the five families.

9734433 9738552 Can't go to Vegas.<br />Something's come up.
9738646 9740228 Everybody has to leave without us.
9740356 9743348 - CONNIE: Mike, it's our first vacation!<br />- Connie, please.
9743442 9747060 Go back to the house, wait for my call.<br />It's important.
9748197 9750404 I'll only be a couple of days.
9766799 9769040 We're on our way to Brooklyn.
9771262 9774971 - I hope Mike can get us a good deal.<br />- I'm sure he will.
9782690 9788151 Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a<br />separate car, so you two go on ahead.
9788237 9791775 - That screws up my arrangements.<br />- That's what he said.
9791865 9794072 I can't go either, Sal.
9806046 9809880 Tell Mike it was only business.<br />I always liked him.
9811510 9814252 - He understands that.<br />Excuse me, Sal.
9820269 9822886 Tom, can you get me off the hook?
9824106 9827315 - For old times' sake?<br />- Can't do it, Sally.
9858682 9860264 (TELEPHONE BEING DIALLED)
9872613 9875321 You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.
9880245 9884330 - Mike, you got it all wrong.<br />- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.
9885209 9889294 That little farce<br />you played with my sister.
9889380 9894250 - You think that could fool a Corleone?<br />- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.
9894343 9897256 - Please, don't do this.<br />- Sit down.
9899848 9902180 Don't do this to me, please.

9918784 9920366 Moe Greene.
9921328 9925071 Strachi. Cuneo.
9927000 9932120 Today I settle all family business,<br />so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
9932256 9934167 Admit what you did.
9938137 9939719 Get him a drink.
9946103 9947434 Come on.
9948564 9951147 Don't be afraid, Carlo.
9951233 9954100 Do you think<br />I'd make my sister a widow?
9955195 9957903 I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.
9964746 9966783 Go ahead, drink, drink.
9971545 9975334 No, you're out of the family business.<br />That's your punishment.
9976425 9980384 You're finished.<br />I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.
9980512 9982253 Tom.
9986435 9990019 I want you to stay there. Understand?
9990147 9992559 Only don't tell me you're innocent.
9993817 9998186 Because it insults my intelligence.<br />Makes me very angry.
10002451 10004317 Who approached you?
10005621 10007953 Tattaglia or Barzini?
10015797 10017413 It was Barzini.
10021595 10023302 Good.
10029353 10033438 There's a car waiting outside<br />to take you to the airport.

10145344 10147381 KAY: What is it?<br />CONNIE: Where is he?
10149640 10154806 Michael, you lousy bastard!<br />You killed my husband.
10154936 10159021 You waited until Papa died,<br />so nobody could stop you.
10159107 10162190 You blamed him for Sonny.<br />Everybody did.
10162319 10168031 But you never thought about me!<br />Now what are we going to do?
10168158 10169694 KAY: Connie.
10171995 10174612 CONNIE: Why do you think<br />he kept Carlo at the Mall?
10174748 10177581 He knew he was going to kill him.
10177668 10183084 And you stood godfather to our baby.<br />You lousy cold-hearted bastard!
10183215 10187300 Want to know how many men he had<br />killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

10242315 10245899 - Don't ask me about my business, Kay.<br />- Is it true?
10246027 10248689 Don't ask me about my business.<br />Enough!
10268800 10270416 All right.
