76618 79121 I believe in America.
79496 81999 America has made my fortune
82583 85085 and I raised my daughter<br />in the American fashion.
86753 89548 I gave her freedom,<br />but I taught her
89631 92134 never to dishonor her family.
93010 96221 She found a boyfriend.<br />Not an Italian.
96346 98682 She went to the movies with him.
98682 101768 She stayed out late.<br />I didn't protest.
103562 106398 Two months ago,<br />he took her for a drive
106481 108984 with another boyfriend.
109318 111945 They made her drink whiskey,
112070 115240 and then they tried<br />to take advantage of her.
116491 118660 She resisted.
118660 121163 She kept her honor.
121914 124917 So they beat her like an animal.
126877 130547 When I went to the hospital,<br />her nose was broken...
131882 134009 her jaw was shattered...
134009 136512 held together by wire.
138555 141099 She couldn't even weep<br />because of the pain.
143936 147439 But I wept.<br />Why did I weep?
150108 152611 She was the light of my life.
154488 156990 Beautiful girl.
159952 162454 Now she will never<br />be beautiful again.
169628 172130 Sorry.
180264 182766 I, I went to the police,<br />like a good American.
183809 186311 These two boys<br />were brought to trial.
187646 190399 A judge sentence them<br />to three years in prison...
190482 192985 and suspend their sentence.
193819 196321 Suspended the sentence.
196363 198866 They went free that very day.
201034 203537 I stood in the courtroom<br />like a fool.
204413 207666 And those two bastard,<br />they smiled at me.
209251 212671 Then I said to my wife,<br />"For justice...
212796 215299 we must go to Don Corleone."
220179 223515 Why did you go to the police?<br />Why didn't you come to me first?
224683 226518 What do you want of me?
226518 229605 Tell me anything,<br />but do what I beg you to do.
230814 233317 What is that?
257216 259718 That I cannot do.
260219 262721 I'll give you anything you ask.
265098 267893 We've known each other many years,<br />but this is the first time...
267976 271313 you ever came to me<br />for counsel or for help.
271396 274358 I can't remember the last time<br />that you invited me...
274441 276944 to your house<br />for a cup of coffee...
278028 281698 even though my wife<br />is godmother to your only child.
281782 284076 But let's be frank.
284076 286578 You never wanted my friendship...
287079 290707 and you were afraid<br />to be in my debt.
290791 293293 I didn't want<br />to get into trouble.
294419 296922 I understand.
297297 299800 You found paradise in America.
302594 304596 You had a good trade,<br />you made a good living.
304596 307307 Police protected you,<br />and there were courts of law.
307432 309935 So you didn't need<br />a friend like me.
311770 315315 But, now you come to me<br />and you say,
315440 317943 "Don Corleone, give me justice."
319653 322531 But you don't ask with respect.
322614 325200 You don't offer friendship.
325284 327786 You don't even think<br />to call me 'Godfather.'
328954 330747 Instead, you come into my house
330747 332749 on the day my daughter<br />is to be married
332749 335252 and you ask me to do murder<br />for money.
336086 338630 I ask you for justice.
338755 341466 That is not justice.<br />Your daughter is still alive.
342801 346138 They must suffer then<br />as she suffers.
348223 350726 How much shall I pay you?
365282 367784 Bonasera. Bonasera.
369328 372664 What have I ever done to make you<br />treat me so disrespectfully?
374500 377044 If you'd come to me<br />in friendship,
377169 379171 then the scum<br />that ruined your daughter
379171 381673 would be suffering<br />this very day.
382633 383884 And if, by chance,
383884 385969 an honest man like yourself<br />should make enemies,
385969 388472 then they would become<br />my enemies.
390557 393060 And then they would fear you.
397147 399650 Be my friend?
403070 405572 Godfather.
409159 411662 Good.
412329 414706 Someday, and that day<br />may never come...
414706 417209 I'll call upon you<br />to do a service for me.
419002 421505 But until that day...
422756 425759 accept this justice as a gift<br />on my daughter's wedding day.
427219 429721 <i>- Grazie, Godfather.</i><br />- Prego
436770 439273 Give this to Clemenza.
441775 443235 I want reliable people,
443235 445404 people that aren't<br />going to be carried away.
445404 446947 I mean, we're not murderers,
446947 449533 in spite of what<br />this undertaker says.
474850 476518 - Where's Michael?<br />- What? Don't worry.
476518 478270 It's early. He'll be here.
478270 479521 We're not taking it.
479521 482024 We're not taking the picture<br />without Michael.
482524 484526 <i>No picture now.</i>
488405 490908 - What's the matter, Sonny?<br />- It's Michael.
540916 543418 Don Barzini.
545921 547923 <i>Welcome to our house.</i>
559142 562271 Hey, Paulie!<br />Let me have some wine.
562354 564940 Paulie! More wine.
565023 566316 <i>Scusi, please.</i>
566316 568151 You look terrif on the floor.
568151 570654 What are you,<br />a dance judge or something?
571655 574157 Go take a walk around<br />the neighborhood. Do your job.
581707 583709 Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.<br />Watch the kids.
583709 586670 - Don't let 'em run wild, all right?<br />- Well, you watch yourself, all right?
608817 611111 Twenty or thirty grand.
611111 613614 In small bills, cash.
613947 616450 In that little silk purse.
616909 619411 Maron, if this was someone else's wedding, sweet<br />tonato!
620078 622873 <i>Hey, Paulie!</i><br />I got two gobbagool...
622956 624833 <i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>
624833 627336 Stupid jerk!
635552 638055 Hey, what's the matter?
649608 652027 - I have to go back to work.<br />- Oh, Tom.
652027 653362 It's part of the wedding.
653362 656281 No Sicilian can refuse any request<br />on his daughter's wedding day.
662287 664623 Don Corleone,<br />I am honored and grateful...
664623 667125 that you have invited me<br />to your home...
671797 673006 Get outta here.
673006 675509 This is a private party.<br />Go on.
676468 678971 What is it?<br />Hey, my sister's wedding.
686019 688522 Goddamn FBI<br />don't respect nothin'.
691191 694486 Hey, come here, come here.<br />Come here!
695863 698365 There.
709293 711378 But towards the end<br />he was paroled...
711378 714006 to help with<br />the American war effort.
714131 716633 For the last six months, he's been<br />working at my pastry shop.
717217 719386 Nazorine, my friend,<br />what can I do for you?
719386 721889 Now that the war is over...
721972 725017 this boy, Enzo, they want<br />to repatriate him back to Italy.
726143 728687 Godfather, I have a daughter.
728812 731315 See, she and Enzo...
732232 734318 You want Enzo to stay<br />in this country...
734318 736820 and you want your daughter<br />to be married.
737863 740365 You understand everything.
741074 743577 Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
746163 748165 And wait till you see<br />the beautiful wedding cake...
748165 749583 I made for your daughter.
749583 752169 Like this, with the bride<br />and the groom and...
758425 761512 - Who should I give this job to?<br />- Not to our paisan.
763222 765807 Give it to a Jew congressman<br />in another district.
766934 769436 Who else is on the list?
775567 777778 Hey, Michael.<br />How are you?
777778 780280 Hello.
796964 799716 He's not on the list,<br />but Luca Brasi wants to see you.
806139 808475 Is this... Is this necessary?
808475 810435 He didn't expect to be invited<br />to the wedding...
810435 812479 so he wanted to thank you.
812479 814189 All right.
814189 817401 Don Corleone,<br />I am honored and grateful...
817526 820028 that you have invited me<br />to your home...
820112 822614 on the wedding day<br />of your daughter.
823031 825534 And may their first child<br />be a masculine child.
825617 828162 - Don...<br />- Michael?
828287 829830 Don Corleone...
829830 832332 That man over there<br />is talking to himself.
833250 835752 See that scary guy over there?
836295 837588 He's a very scary guy.
837588 839923 Who is he?<br />What's his name?
839923 842509 His name is Luca Brasi...
842634 845137 and he helps my father out<br />sometimes.
845721 848432 Oh, Michael, wait a minute.<br />He's coming over here.
848432 849433 Mike!
849433 850934 Ho! Tom.
850934 852436 Heyyy!
853604 855480 You look terrific!
855480 857691 My brother Tom Hagen.<br />This is Kay Adams.
857691 860235 - How do you do?<br />- Nice to meet you.
860319 862696 Your father's<br />been asking for you.
862696 864448 - Very nice to meet you.<br />- Nice to meet you.
864448 866950 I'll be there.
867326 869995 If he's your brother,<br />why does he have a different name?
871121 873123 Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...
873123 875626 he found Tom Hagen in the street,<br />and he had no home.
876502 879004 And so my father took him in...
879588 882090 and he's been with us ever since.
882799 885302 He's a good lawyer.
885719 888096 Not a Sicilian, but...
888096 890432 I think he's gonna be consigliere.
890432 892935 - What's that?<br />- That's...
893519 895187 like a counselor, an advisor.
895187 897689 Very important to the family.
898273 900776 You like your lasagna?
904738 909701 Don Corleone,<br />I am honored and grateful...
909785 912996 that you have invited me<br />to your daughter's wedding...
918627 921129 on the day<br />of your daughter's wedding.
922047 924883 And I hope<br />that their first child...
925008 927511 be a masculine child.
928345 933350 I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.
935227 937229 For your daughter's<br />bridal purse.
937229 940232 Thank you, Luca,<br />my most valued friend.
940357 943819 Don Corleone,<br />I'm gonna leave you now...
943902 945988 because I know you are busy.
945988 948490 Thank you.
1072197 1074992 Senator Cauly apologized<br />for not coming personally...
1075075 1077578 but said you'd understand.
1077911 1080414 Also some of the judges.
1080914 1084418 They've all sent gifts.<br />Salute!
1085252 1087754 What is that outside?
1095721 1098390 Johnny!
1101351 1103854 I love you.
1109902 1112529 Hey, Johnny, look over here!
1112654 1115365 He came all the way from California<br />to come to the wedding.
1115490 1117576 - I told you he was going to come.<br />- It's been two years.
1117576 1120078 - He's probably in trouble again.<br />- He's a good godson.
1124333 1126835 Sing a song.
1141016 1143894 Michael, you never told me<br />you knew Johnny Fontane.
1143977 1147940 - Sure. You wanna meet him?<br />- Huh? Oh, well, sure.
1148065 1150108 My father helped him<br />with his career.
1150108 1153237 - For my Connie.<br />- He did? How?
1153320 1155113 <i>I have but one</i>
1155113 1157032 - Let's listen to the song.<br />- No, Michael
1157115 1158659 <i>Heart</i>
1158659 1162371 <i>This heart I bring you</i>
1163956 1168293 <i>I have but one heart</i>
1168418 1170921 <i>To share with you</i>
1173382 1177636 <i>I have but one dream</i>
1177761 1181348 <i>That I can cling to</i>
1182808 1187521 <i>You are the one dream</i>
1187646 1190899 <i>I pray comes true</i>
1191817 1194027 Please, Michael. Tell me.
1194027 1197698 <i>My darling, until I saw you</i>
1197823 1199825 Well, when Johnny was first starting out...
1199825 1202661 he was signed to this<br />personal service contract...
1202786 1205289 with a big bandleader.
1205706 1207791 And as his career<br />got better and better...
1207791 1210294 he wanted to get out of it.
1211003 1213672 Now, Johnny is<br />my father's godson...
1213797 1216300 and my father went<br />to see this bandleader...
1217217 1219720 and he offered him<br />$10,000 to let Johnny go.
1221180 1223682 But the bandleader said no.
1224099 1227144 So the next day<br />my father went to see him...
1227269 1229771 only this time with Luca Brasi.
1231398 1234484 And within an hour,<br />he signed a release...
1236653 1239281 for a certified check of $1,000.
1240949 1242159 How'd he do that?
1242159 1244661 My father made him an offer<br />he couldn't refuse.
1246121 1248624 What was that?
1248749 1251460 Luca Brasi<br />held a gun to his head...
1251543 1253837 and my father assured him<br />that either his brains...
1253837 1256340 or his signature<br />would be on the contract.
1261887 1264389 That's a true story.
1274775 1277277 That's my family, Kay.<br />It's not me.
1290123 1292626 Beautiful!
1300592 1302928 My godson comes all the way<br />from California.
1302928 1305430 Give him a glass of wine.
1324158 1326660 I'll take care of it.
1328245 1331123 I want you to find Santino.<br />Tell him to come to the office.
1339173 1341675 How are you, Fredo?
1342301 1344803 My brother Fredo.<br />This is Kay Adams.
1345929 1348432 - Hi.<br />- How ya doin'?
1350184 1353395 - This is my brother Mike.<br />- Are you having a good time?
1353478 1355981 Yeah.<br />This is your friend, huh?
1357232 1361403 I don't know what to do.<br />My voice is, is weak.
1361486 1363822 It's weak.
1363822 1366450 Anyway, if I had this part<br />in the picture, you know...
1366575 1369203 it puts me right back<br />up on top again.
1370329 1372831 But this, uh...
1372998 1375083 this man out there,<br />he won't give it to me.
1375083 1377169 - The head of the studio.<br />- What's his name?
1377169 1379755 Woltz. Woltz.<br />He won't give it to me...
1379838 1383425 and he says<br />there's no chance, no chance.
1387429 1389932 Sonny?
1390641 1391642 Sonny?
1398190 1399191 Sonny?
1400067 1401902 Sonny, you in there?
1402152 1404655 - What?<br />- The old man wants to see you.
1406114 1408617 All right, one minute.
1422339 1425342 A month ago, he bought<br />the movie rights to this book.
1425467 1427302 A best-seller.
1427302 1429596 And the main character<br />is a guy just like me.
1429596 1432099 Why, I wouldn't even<br />have to act.
1432224 1433600 Just be myself.
1433600 1437479 Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.<br />I don't know what to do.
1438856 1441817 You can act like a man!<br />What's the matter with you?
1443151 1444653 Is this how you turned out?
1444653 1447281 A Hollywood finocchio<br />that cries like a woman?
1448949 1451285 "What can I do?"<br />"What can I do?"
1451285 1452870 What is that nonsense?
1452870 1455372 Ridiculous!
1459334 1462629 - You spend time with your family?<br />- Sure I do.
1462754 1464298 Good.
1464298 1466425 Because the man who doesn't<br />spend time with his family...
1466425 1468760 can never be a real man.
1468760 1471263 Come here.
1474725 1477227 You look terrible.<br />I want you to eat.
1478312 1480439 I want you to rest well,<br />and a month from now...
1480439 1483567 this Hollywood big shot's<br />gonna give you what you want.
1483692 1486195 Too late.<br />They start shooting in a week.
1486945 1489448 I'm gonna make him an offer<br />he can't refuse.
1492910 1494953 Now just go outside,<br />enjoy yourself and...
1494953 1497581 forget about all this nonsense.
1499082 1501668 Listen. I want you<br />to leave it all to me.
1502628 1505130 All right.
1528320 1531114 What time does my daughter<br />leave with the bridegroom?
1531198 1533700 In a few minutes,<br />right after they cut the cake.
1533700 1536912 Now, your new son-in-law,<br />we give him something important.
1536995 1539373 Never.<br />Give him a living...
1539373 1542417 but never discuss<br />the family business with him.
1542501 1543919 What else?
1543919 1545504 Virgil Sollozzo called.
1545504 1547923 We have to give him a day<br />sometime next week.
1547923 1550425 We'll discuss him when you<br />come back from California.
1551260 1552803 When am I going to California?
1552803 1554888 I want you to go tonight.
1554888 1557683 I want you to talk<br />to this movie big shot...
1557808 1560310 and settle this business<br />for Johnny.
1561353 1564231 Now if there's nothing else, I'd like<br />to go to my daughter's wedding.
1567609 1570112 Carlo, we're gonna take<br />the picture.
1571738 1573574 Wait a minute.
1573574 1576076 No, Michael, not me.
1578996 1580330 Just a little closer.
1580330 1582833 Okay, that's it.<br />Just like that now. Hold it.
1687646 1690148 Isn't that nice?
1695153 1696864 All right, start talking.
1696864 1699366 I was sent by a friend<br />of Johnny Fontane.
1700159 1702828 This friend is my client and would<br />give his undying friendship...
1702953 1706665 to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz<br />would grant us a small favor.
1706790 1709293 Woltz is listening.
1709293 1712379 Give Johnny the part in that new<br />war film you're starting next week.
1719052 1722055 And what favor<br />would your friend...
1722181 1724057 grant Mr. Woltz?
1724057 1725976 You're gonna have<br />some union problems.
1725976 1727811 My client could make them disappear.
1727811 1729938 Also, one of your top stars<br />has just moved...
1729938 1731940 from marijuana to heroin.
1731940 1733942 - Are you trying to muscle me?<br />- Absolutely not.
1733942 1736361 Now listen to me,<br />you smooth-talking son of a bitch!
1736361 1738989 Let me lay it on the line for you<br />and your boss, whoever he is!
1739114 1740741 Johnny Fontane<br />will never get that movie.
1740741 1743243 I don't care<br />how many dago, guinea, wop...
1743243 1745621 greaseball goombahs<br />come outta the woodwork.
1745621 1746872 I'm German-Irish.
1746872 1749500 Well, let me tell you something,<br />my kraut mick friend.
1749583 1752503 I'm going to make so much trouble for you,<br />you won't know what hit you.
1752586 1754588 Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.<br />I have not threatened...
1754588 1757508 I know almost every big lawyer<br />in New York. Who the hell are you?
1757591 1760844 I have a special practice.<br />I handle one client.
1760928 1763430 Now, you have my number.<br />I'll wait for your call.
1764848 1767351 By the way, I admire<br />your pictures very much.
1772272 1774775 Check him out.
1796588 1799091 - This is really beautiful.<br />- Look at this.
1799216 1801426 It used to decorate<br />the palace of a king.
1801426 1803720 Oh, yeah. Very nice.
1803720 1806348 Why didn't you say<br />you worked for Corleone, Tom?
1806431 1808725 I thought you were just<br />some cheap, two-bit hustler...
1808725 1810769 Johnny was running in,<br />trying to bluff me.
1810769 1813272 I don't like to use his name<br />unless it's really necessary.
1813272 1814898 - How's your drink, Tom?<br />- Fine.
1814898 1817609 Hey, come on over here with me. I want to<br />show you something really beautiful.
1817734 1820237 You do appreciate beauty,<br />don't you, Tom?
1823282 1826285 There you are.<br />$600,000 on four hooves.
1826410 1827744 I'll bet Russian czars...
1827744 1830080 never paid that kind of dough<br />for a single horse.
1830080 1832583 Khartoum.
1835460 1839423 I'm not gonna race him, though.<br />I'm gonna put him out to stud.
1839506 1841091 Beautiful.
1841091 1842759 - Thanks, Tony.<br />- You're welcome.
1842759 1845262 - Come on.<br />- Let's get something to eat.
1846722 1849224 Mr. Corleone<br />is Johnny's godfather.
1850184 1852561 To the Italian people,<br />that's a very religious...
1852561 1854563 sacred, close relationship.
1854563 1855689 I respect that.
1855689 1858192 Just tell him he should ask me<br />anything else.
1858317 1860819 But this is one favor<br />I can't give him.
1861111 1863614 He never asks a second favor<br />when he's been refused the first.
1863655 1866658 - Understood?<br />- You don't understand.
1866783 1869286 Johnny Fontane<br />never gets that movie.
1870704 1874374 That part is perfect for him.<br />It'll make him a big star.
1874500 1876502 I'm gonna run him<br />out of the business.
1876502 1879004 And let me tell you why.
1880672 1883342 Johnny Fontane ruined<br />one of Woltz International's...
1883467 1885469 most valuable prot�g�s.
1885469 1887804 For five years,<br />we had her under training.
1887804 1890849 Singing lessons,<br />acting lessons, dancing lessons.
1890974 1893352 I spent hundreds of thousands<br />of dollars on her.
1893352 1895687 I was gonna make her a big star.
1895687 1898398 And let me be even more frank.
1898524 1900901 Just to show you that I'm not<br />a hard-hearted man...
1900901 1903445 that it's not all dollars and cents.
1903529 1905364 She was beautiful!
1905572 1907574 She was young, she was innocent!
1907574 1909576 She was the greatest piece of ass<br />I've ever had...
1909576 1912079 and I've had 'em all over the world!
1912788 1914957 And then Johnny Fontane comes along...
1914957 1917876 with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.
1919169 1921672 And she runs off.
1922047 1925008 She threw it all away<br />just to make me look ridiculous...
1926218 1928679 and a man in my position can't afford...
1928679 1931431 to be made to look ridiculous!
1931557 1933934 Now you get the hell outta here!
1933934 1936061 And if that goombah<br />tries any rough stuff...
1936061 1938564 you tell him I ain't no bandleader.
1939857 1942484 Yeah. I heard that story.
1943569 1946071 Thank you for the dinner<br />and a very pleasant evening.
1947531 1950117 If your car could take me<br />to the airport...
1950242 1954037 Mr. Corleone is a man who insists<br />on hearing bad news immediately.
2066984 2070654 - You're not too tired are you, Tom?<br />- No, I slept on the plane.
2070779 2073282 I have the Sollozzo notes here.
2073907 2076410 Now...
2077202 2079705 Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."
2080706 2082749 He's supposed to be<br />very good with a knife...
2082749 2084543 <i>but only</i><br />in matters of business...
2084543 2087045 <i>with some sort</i><br />of reasonable complaint.
2087838 2090382 <i>His business is narcotics.</i>
2090507 2093844 <i>He has fields in Turkey</i><br />where they grow the poppy...
2093927 2096847 <i>and in Sicily he has the plants</i><br />to process them into heroin.
2098098 2101518 <i>Now, he needs cash and he needs</i><br />protection from the police...
2101602 2103729 <i>for which he gives</i><br />a piece of the action.
2103729 2105731 <i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>
2105731 2108525 <i>The Tattaglia family</i><br />is behind him here in New York.
2108609 2110777 <i>Now, they have to be</i><br />in it for something.
2110777 2111904 Santino Corleone.
2111904 2113780 What about his prison record?
2113780 2116283 Two terms,<br />one in Italy, one here.
2116867 2119369 He's known as<br />a top narcotics man.
2119369 2121872 Santino, what do you think?
2122956 2125459 There's a lot of money<br />in that white powder.
2126793 2128086 Tom?
2128086 2130589 <i>Well, I say, yes, there's more</i><br />money potential in narcotics...
2130672 2132674 <i>than anything else</i><br />we're looking at.
2132674 2135093 <i>Now, if we don't get into it,</i><br />somebody else will.
2135093 2137262 <i>Maybe one of the five families,</i><br />maybe all of them.
2137262 2138430 <i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>
2138430 2141767 they can buy more police<br />and political power.
2141892 2144102 Then they come after us.
2144102 2146855 Now we have the unions,<br />we have the gambling...
2146939 2149274 and they're the best things<br />to have, but narcotics...
2149274 2150776 is a thing of the future.
2150776 2152611 Now, if we don't get<br />a piece of that action...
2152611 2154112 we risk everything we have.
2154112 2156615 I mean, not now,<br />but ten years from now.
2160118 2163247 So? What's your answer<br />gonna be, Pop?
2167960 2170963 Bene. Don Corleone.
2171964 2174466 I need a man<br />who has powerful friends.
2175384 2178095 I need a million dollars in cash.
2178178 2180305 I need, Don Corleone,<br />those politicians...
2180305 2183934 that you carry in your pocket<br />like so many nickels and dimes.
2185519 2187646 What is the interest<br />for my family?
2187646 2189606 Thirty percent.
2189606 2192401 In the first year, your end<br />should be three, four million dollars.
2193694 2196196 And then it would go up.
2196822 2199324 And what is the interest<br />for the Tattaglia family?
2202327 2204830 My compliments.
2207624 2210252 I'll take care of the Tattaglias.<br />Outta my share.
2211253 2213964 So, I receive 30%<br />for finance...
2215507 2217551 political influence<br />and legal protection.
2217551 2220053 - That's what you're telling me.<br />- That's right.
2221972 2225851 Why do you come to me?<br />Why do I deserve this generosity?
2225976 2228896 If you consider<br />a million dollars in cash...
2229021 2231190 just "finance"...
2231190 2233192 <i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>
2244036 2246997 I said that I would see you because...
2247080 2249291 I heard that you were<br />a serious man...
2249291 2251793 to be treated with respect.
2256423 2259635 But I must say no to you.
2260802 2263263 And I'll give you my reason.
2263263 2266058 It's true, I have<br />a lot of friends in politics.
2267726 2269728 But they wouldn't be friendly<br />very long...
2269728 2272105 if they knew my business was drugs<br />instead of gambling...
2272105 2275317 which they regard<br />as a harmless vice.
2275400 2278028 - But drugs is a dirty business.<br />- No, Don Corleone...
2278153 2280155 It doesn't make<br />any difference to me...
2280155 2282908 what a man does for a living,<br />you understand...
2283033 2285536 but your business is...
2286578 2288330 a little dangerous.
2288330 2290833 If you're worried about security<br />for your million...
2290833 2292543 the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
2292543 2295254 You're tellin' me the Tattaglias<br />guarantee our investment...
2295379 2297881 Wait a minute.
2303804 2305931 I have a sentimental weakness<br />for my children...
2305931 2308267 and I spoil them,<br />as you can see.
2308267 2309977 They talk when they should listen.
2309977 2312104 But anyway...
2312104 2314606 Signor Sollozzo,<br />my no is final...
2314690 2317484 and I wish to congratulate you<br />on your new business.
2317609 2320863 I know you'll do very well,<br />and good luck to you...
2320946 2323949 especially since your interests<br />don't conflict with mine.
2325367 2327870 Thank you.
2348307 2350809 Come here.
2352603 2354438 What's the matter with you?
2354438 2356231 I think your brain<br />is going soft...
2356231 2359109 from all that comedy you're<br />playing with that young girl.
2359193 2362613 Never tell anybody outside the<br />family what you're thinking again.
2364781 2367284 Go on.
2369995 2372748 Tom, what?<br />What is this nonsense?
2372831 2375334 It's from Johnny.<br />He's starring in that new film.
2378003 2379880 Well, take it away.
2379880 2382382 Take it over there.
2382674 2385135 And...
2385135 2387638 tell Luca Brasi to come in.
2393477 2396647 I'm a little worried<br />about this Sollozzo fellow.
2396730 2400108 I want you to find out what he's got<br />under his fingernails, you know?
2400943 2403028 Go to the Tattaglias...
2403028 2405364 and make them think...
2405364 2409034 that you're not too happy<br />with our family...
2410160 2412663 and find out what you can.
2429471 2433433 And I got something<br />for your mother and for Sonny...
2433559 2435602 and a tie for Freddy...
2435602 2438313 and Tom Hagen<br />got the Reynolds pen.
2438397 2440524 - What do you want for Christmas?<br />- Me?
2440524 2443026 Oh, just you.
2473348 2475350 Andiamo, Fredo.
2475350 2477352 Tell Paulie to get the car.<br />We're going.
2477352 2478770 Okay, Pa.
2478770 2481690 I'll have to get it myself, Pa.<br />Paulie called in sick this morning.
2484693 2487196 Paulie's a good kid.<br />I don't mind gettin' the car.
2491700 2493202 Buon nateli, Dano. Grazie

2551969 2552469 I know you.
2552970 2563438 You have been talking to the Tattaglia<br />family... right? I think you and I can do<br />business.
2563939 2576451 I need someone strong like you.<br />I heard you are not happy with the<br />Corleone family. Want to join me?.
2576952 2578954 What's in it for me?.
2580038 2583167 $50,000...to start with..
2587045 2588172 Not bad.
2589965 2591175 Agreed?
2608942 2610152 Grazie.
2650609 2652611 Oh. Tom Hagen.
2652611 2654404 - Merry Christmas.<br />- Yeah.
2654404 2657324 I'm glad I run into you.<br />I wanna talk to you.
2657449 2659326 I haven't got time.
2659326 2662079 Oh, make time, consigliere.<br />Get in the car.
2664206 2665791 What are you worried about?
2665791 2668293 If I wanted to kill you,<br />you'd be dead already.
2669127 2671630 Get in.
2681807 2683308 <i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>
2683308 2686311 - I'm gonna buy some fruit.<br />- Okay, Pa.
2691441 2693318 Hi. Merry Christmas.
2693318 2695821 I want some fruit over there.
2698574 2701076 Gimme three of them.
2702161 2704663 No, that one.
2722806 2725309 Fredo!
2771939 2774441 Papa.
2774483 2776985 Papa!
2781824 2784576 Mike, would you like me better<br />if I were a nun...
2784701 2787204 like in the story, you know?
2789414 2790415 No.
2790541 2793418 Well, then would you like me better<br />if I were Ingrid Bergman?
2793544 2796046 Now that's a thought.
2797422 2798423 Michael.
2799091 2802344 No, I would not like you better<br />if you were Ingrid Bergman.
2802427 2804930 - Michael.<br />- What's the matter?
2820737 2823240 They don't say<br />if he's dead or alive.
2845429 2847347 Sonny, Michael.
2847347 2848765 <i>Michael, where you been?</i>
2848849 2850517 Is he all right?
2850517 2853270 <i>We don't know yet.</i><br />There's all kinds of stories.
2854813 2857316 <i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>
2857733 2860861 <i>- Are you there?</i><br />- Yeah, I'm here.
2860986 2863405 <i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>
2863405 2865574 Didn't Tom tell you?<br />I called.
2865574 2869286 <i>No. Look, come home, kid.</i><br />You should be with Mama, you hear?
2869411 2871914 All right.
2877628 2880130 Oh, my God.
2894102 2896605 Who is it?
2896688 2899191 Open up. It's Clemenza.
2900192 2901276 What?
2901276 2903779 There's more news about your old man.
2904238 2906323 The word is out on the street<br />he's already dead.
2906323 2908325 Shut your mouth.<br />What's the matter with you?
2908325 2910828 Jesus Christ!<br />Take it easy. Take it easy.
2910869 2913038 - Where was Paulie?<br />- Paulie was out sick.
2913038 2915582 - He's been home sick all winter.<br />- How many times he been sick?
2915624 2917209 Only maybe three, four times.
2917209 2919253 I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants<br />a different bodyguard.
2919253 2921004 - He said no.<br />- Pick him up right now.
2921004 2922840 I don't care how sick he is. If he's breathin',...
2922840 2925509 I want you to bring him to<br />my father's house now. You understand? Now
2925592 2928387 Yeah. You want me to send any people over<br />here? - No, just you and him. Go ahead.
2928512 2931014 All right.
2936019 2941233 Look, uh... I'm havin' a couple of our people come<br />over to the house. A couple of our people.
2944820 2947072 <i>- Hello?</i><br />- Santino Corleone?
2947072 2949575 <i>- Yeah.</i><br />- We have Tom Hagen.
2950242 2953704 <i>In about three hours, he'll be</i><br />released with our proposition.
2953787 2957166 <i>Listen to everything he has</i><br />to say before you do anything.
2957249 2958917 <i>What's done is done.</i>
2958917 2961879 <i>And don't lose that famous temper</i><br />of yours, huh, Sonny?
2961962 2964464 No, I'll wait.
2977978 2980481 Your boss is dead.
2982816 2985277 I know you're not in the muscle<br />end of the family, Tom...
2985277 2987779 so I don't want you to be scared.
2988363 2990908 I want you<br />to help the Corleones...
2990991 2993494 and I want you to help me.
2996079 2997915 Yeah. We got him outside his office...
2997915 3000417 just about an hour after we picked you up.
3002252 3004755 Drink it.
3007883 3011303 So now it's up to you to make<br />the peace between me and Sonny.
3015849 3018352 Sonny was hot<br />for my deal, wasn't he?
3019770 3022272 And you knew it was<br />the right thing to do.
3024107 3026610 Sonny will come after you<br />with everything he's got.
3027361 3029863 That'll be his first reaction, sure.
3030656 3033033 That's why you gotta<br />talk some sense into him.
3033033 3036286 The Tattaglia family is behind me<br />with all their people.
3037246 3039414 The other New York families<br />will go along with anything...
3039414 3041917 that will prevent a full-scale war.
3042501 3044837 Let's face it, Tom,<br />in all due respect...
3044837 3047422 the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.
3050342 3052845 Ten years ago,<br />could I have gotten to him?
3057307 3058851 Well, now he's dead.
3058851 3061353 He's dead, Tom,<br />and nothing can bring him back.
3063021 3065149 So you gotta talk to Sonny.
3065149 3067067 You gotta talk<br />to the caporegimes...
3067067 3069570 that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.
3073991 3076493 It's good business, Tom.
3077411 3079705 I'll try.
3079705 3082374 But even Sonny won't be able<br />to call off Luca Brasi.
3085377 3087880 Yeah. Well...
3088714 3091216 Let me worry about Luca.
3096597 3098515 You just talk to Sonny.
3098515 3101018 And the other two kids.
3104229 3105731 I'll do my best.
3105731 3108233 Good.
3109067 3111570 Now, you can go.
3118410 3121747 I don't like violence, Tom.<br />I'm a businessman.
3123290 3125792 Blood is a big expense.
3146897 3148774 He's still alive.
3148774 3151276 They hit him with five shots,<br />and he's still alive!
3152778 3154780 Well, that's bad luck for me...
3154780 3157282 and bad luck for you<br />if you don't make that deal.
3202286 3204329 Your mother's over<br />in the hospital with your father.
3204329 3206832 Looks like he's gonna<br />pull through, thank God.
3208917 3211170 - That's a lot of bad blood.<br />- What do you think?
3211170 3214047 It's too far.<br />I think it's too personal.
3214173 3216800 - The Don will consider this over.<br />- You gonna kill all those guys?
3216925 3219428 - Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.<br />- Sollozzo's the key.
3219428 3221722 You get rid of him,<br />everything falls into line.
3221722 3224308 What about Luca? Sollozzo<br />didn't seem worried about Luca.
3226018 3229813 I don't know. If Luca sold out,<br />we're in a lot of trouble.
3229897 3231982 Has anyone been able<br />to get in touch with Luca?
3231982 3234067 We've been tryin' all night.<br />He might be shacked up.
3234067 3235152 Hey, Mick, try him again.
3235152 3236820 Luca never sleeps over<br />with a broad.
3236820 3239323 He always goes home<br />when he's through.
3239865 3242826 Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
3242910 3246038 What do we do<br />if the old man dies, God forbid?
3246163 3248665 If we lose the old man...
3249416 3252377 we lose our political contacts<br />and half our strength.
3252461 3255380 The other New York families might<br />wind up supporting Sollozzo...
3255464 3257841 just to avoid a long destructive war.
3257841 3261553 This is almost 1946.<br />Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
3262804 3265307 If your father dies...
3266642 3268393 you'll make the deal, Sonny.
3268393 3270979 You know, that's easy for you to say,<br />Tom. He's not your father.
3271063 3273565 I was as much a son to him<br />as you or Mike.
3278028 3280531 What is it?
3280531 3282991 Hey, Paulie, I thought<br />I told you to stay put.
3282991 3285619 Well, the guy at the gates,<br />they say they got a package.
3285744 3288247 Yeah?<br />Tessio, go see what it is.
3291583 3293585 - You want me to hang around?<br />- Yeah, hang around.
3293585 3295087 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm fine.
3295087 3297798 Yeah? There's some food<br />in the icebox. You hungry or anything?
3297923 3299967 - No, it's all right. Thanks.<br />- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?
3299967 3301760 - That's good to sweat it out.<br />- All right, sure.
3301760 3304263 - Go ahead.<br />- That might be a good idea. Yeah, right.
3305931 3308433 I want you to take care<br />of that son of a bitch right away.
3308475 3311019 Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.
3311103 3314231 I don't wanna see him again. Make that<br />first thing on your list, understand?
3314314 3315649 Understood.
3315649 3317985 Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.<br />You get a couple of guys.
3317985 3320195 You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang<br />around. Wait for him to show up.
3320195 3324241 Maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br />mixed up in this too directly.
3324366 3326618 Yeah.
3326618 3330164 Listen, hang around the house<br />on the phone. It'll be a big help.
3331290 3333792 Try Luca again. Go ahead.
3342134 3344928 - What the hell is this?<br />- It's a Sicilian message.
3345053 3347556 It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
3361320 3363822 - I'm goin' now.<br />- What time you gonna be home tonight?
3363864 3366366 I don't know. Probably late.
3367659 3371163 - Don't forget the cannoli.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3373874 3377669 Rocco, sit on the other side.<br />You block the rearview mirror.
3379838 3381423 That Sonny's runnin' wild.
3381423 3383509 He's thinkin' of goin'<br />to the mattresses already.
3383509 3386053 We gotta find a spot<br />over on the West Side.
3386178 3389264 We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.
3389348 3391725 You know any good spots<br />on the West Side?
3391725 3394228 - Yeah, I'll think about it.<br />- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.
3394269 3396605 I wanna hit New York sometime this month.
3396605 3399107 And watch out for the kids<br />when you're backin' out.
3409493 3411912 Hey, Paulie, I want you to go<br />down 39th Street. Colosanto's.
3411912 3414998 You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys<br />to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.
3415082 3418001 - Yeah, all right.I must go look at the bills.<br />No, make sure they're clean because...
3418085 3421296 Those guys are gonna be stuck up<br />in there for a long time, you know?
3421380 3423590 They're clean. They told me<br />they exterminate them.
3423590 3425717 "Exterminate"?<br />That's a bad word to use.
3425717 3428679 Exterminate. Get this guy.<br />See how we don't exterminate you.
3428762 3431974 <i>- Youse funny, or what?</i><br />- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?
3432474 3434977 - Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?<br />- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.
3435060 3437104 - It's gotta be him.<br />- Hey, pull over, will you.
3437104 3439606 I gotta take a leak.
3480814 3482608 Leave the gun.
3482608 3485110 Take the cannoli.
3501919 3503420 <i>Hey, Mike?</i>
3503921 3505422 <i>Hey, Mikey?</i>
3506924 3507925 Yeah?
3508008 3509426 <i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>
3515140 3517643 - Who is it?<br />- It's some girl.
3521688 3522898 Hello, Kay?
3522898 3524274 <i>How's your father?</i>
3524274 3526068 He's good.<br />He's gonna make it.
3526068 3528570 <i>I love you.</i>
3528570 3529571 Huh?
3529863 3531865 <i>I love you!</i>
3532115 3533617 <i>Michael?</i>
3533992 3534993 Yeah, I know.
3534993 3536829 <i>Tell me you love me.</i>
3536829 3538497 Yeah, I can't talk.
3538497 3540290 <i>Can't you say it?</i>
3541124 3543627 Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
3543836 3546797 Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell<br />that nice girl you love her?
3546922 3549007 I love you with all-a my heart!
3549007 3551510 If I don't see you again a-soon,<br />I'm-a gonna die!
3552761 3554763 Come over here, kid.<br />Learn somethin'.
3554763 3557266 You never know. You might have to cook<br />for 20 guys someday.
3557766 3560102 You see? You start out<br />with a little bit of oil.
3560102 3561687 Then you fry some garlic.
3561687 3564314 Then you throw in some tomatoes,<br />some tomato paste.
3564398 3567067 You fry it.<br />You make sure it doesn't stick.
3567192 3570320 When you got it to a boil, you shove in<br />all your sausage and your meatballs.
3573198 3575701 Add a little bit of wine.
3578537 3581456 And a little bit of sugar.
3582207 3584209 - And that's my trick.<br />- Why don't you cut the crap?
3584209 3586378 I got more important things<br />for you to do.
3586378 3589006 - How's Paulie?<br />- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.
3591049 3593552 - Where you going?<br />- To the city.
3593552 3595220 Send some bodyguards with him.
3595220 3597222 - No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.<br />- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.
3597222 3600142 Oh, he'll be all right.<br />Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.
3600225 3602728 - All right. Be careful, huh?<br />- Yes, sir.
3605731 3608233 Send somebody with him anyway.
3636428 3638263 I have to go.
3638263 3640766 Can I go with you?
3641099 3643685 No, Kay. There's gonna be<br />detectives there.
3643769 3645771 People from the press.
3645771 3648273 Well, I'll ride in a cab.
3650275 3652778 I don't want you to get involved.
3655447 3657950 When will I see you again?
3664122 3666124 Go back to New Hampshire...
3666124 3668627 and I'll call you<br />at your parents' house.
3669962 3672464 When will I see you again,<br />Michael?
3673966 3676468 I don't know.
3806515 3808642 What are you doing here?
3808642 3810769 You're not supposed<br />to be here now.
3810769 3814314 I'm Michael Corleone.<br />This is my father.
3814439 3816984 There's nobody here.<br />What happened to the guards?
3817109 3819444 Your father just had<br />too many visitors.
3819444 3822322 They interfered<br />with hospital service.
3822447 3825325 The police made them leave<br />about ten minutes ago.
3830289 3834168 Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.
3836795 3839298 Nurse, wait a minute.<br />Stay here.
3843135 3845470 Sonny, Michael.<br />I'm at the hospital.
3845470 3848015 Listen. I got here late.<br />There's nobody here.
3848140 3851101 Nobody. No Tessio's men,<br />no detectives, nobody.
3851226 3854021 <i>- Pop is all alone.</i><br />- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.
3854146 3856482 I won't panic.
3856482 3859026 I'm sorry, but you will<br />have to leave.
3861987 3864698 You and I are gonna move my father<br />to another room.
3864823 3867868 Now, can you disconnect those tubes<br />so we can move the bed out?
3867993 3871455 - That's out of the question.<br />- Do you know my father?
3871580 3873790 Men are coming here to kill him.
3873790 3875918 You understand?
3875918 3878420 Now, help me, please.
3954746 3959501 - Who are you?<br />- I am Enzo... the baker.
3959585 3961086 - You remember me?<br />- Enzo?
3961086 3962921 - Yes, Enzo.<br />- You better get out of here, Enzo.
3962921 3964923 There's gonna be trouble.
3964923 3967426 If there is trouble,<br />I stay here to help you...
3967426 3969928 For your father. For your father.
3970929 3972764 All right, listen.
3972764 3974933 Wait for me outside,<br />in front of the hospital.
3974933 3977978 All right? I'll be out<br />in a minute. Go ahead.
3977978 3979354 Okay, okay.
3991909 3996205 Just lie here, Pop.<br />I'll take care of you now.
3997414 3999917 I'm with you now.
4001084 4003587 I'm with you.
4038121 4040624 Get rid of these.<br />Come here.
4040958 4043460 Put your hand in your pocket<br />like you have a gun.
4044127 4046630 You'll be all right.
4050884 4053387 You'll be okay.
4097097 4099600 You did good.
4132758 4134927 Here he is.
4134927 4137387 All right, hold still.
4146939 4149274 I thought I got<br />all you guinea hoods locked up.
4149274 4150776 What the hell are you doing here?
4150776 4153237 What happened to the men who<br />were guarding my father, Captain?
4153612 4155280 Why, you little punk.
4155280 4157282 What the hell are you doing,<br />telling me my business?
4157282 4159159 I pulled them guys off of here.
4159159 4162162 Now, you get out of here<br />and stay away from this hospital.
4162287 4165249 I'm not moving until you put<br />some guards around my father's room.
4165958 4167960 Phil, take him in.
4167960 4170379 The kid's clean, Captain.<br />He's a war hero.
4170379 4173298 - He's never been busted...<br />- Goddamn it, I said take him in.
4175384 4177886 What's the Turk paying you<br />to set up my father, Captain?
4179221 4181348 Take a hold of him.<br />Stand him up.
4181348 4183851 Stand him up straight.
4205747 4207833 I'm the attorney<br />for the Corleone family.
4207833 4210544 These men are private detectives<br />hired to protect Vito Corleone.
4211420 4213172 They're licensed to carry firearms.
4213172 4215674 If you interfere, you'll have to<br />appear before a judge...
4215757 4218302 in the morning and show cause.
4218427 4220929 All right, let him go.
4221013 4223474 Come on.
4252961 4254963 What's with all the new faces?
4254963 4256798 Gonna need 'em now.
4256798 4259426 After the hospital thing,<br />Sonny got mad.
4259551 4262679 We hit Bruno Tattaglia<br />at 4:00 this morning.
4263972 4266475 Jesus Christ.
4272815 4275317 Looks like a fortress around here.
4277820 4278904 Tom-anuch!
4279822 4282699 A hundred button men on the street,<br />24 hours a day.
4282825 4286036 That Turk shows one hair<br />on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.
4288664 4291166 Hey, Mike, come here.<br />Let me look at you.
4294586 4296296 You look beautiful.<br />Just beautiful.
4296296 4297798 You're gorgeous.
4297798 4300509 Hey, listen to this.<br />The Turk, he wants to talk.
4300592 4303345 Eh gosh...Imagine the nerve<br />on this son of a bitch.
4303428 4305764 Craps out last night,<br />he wants a meeting today.
4305764 4308267 - What'd he say?<br />- What did he say?
4308934 4311103 He wants us to send Michael<br />to hear the proposition.
4311103 4314189 And the promise is that the deal<br />is so good that we can't refuse.
4314773 4316441 What about Bruno Tattaglia?
4316441 4318110 That's part of the deal.
4318110 4320112 Bruno cancels out what they did<br />to my father.
4320112 4322614 Sonny, we ought to hear<br />what they have to say.
4322948 4325450 No. No. No. No more.<br />Not this time, Consigliere.
4325450 4329037 No more meetings, no more discussions,<br />no more Sollozzo tricks.
4329121 4330956 You give them one message...<br />I want Sollozzo.
4330956 4332624 If not, it's all-out war.<br />We go to the mattresses.
4332624 4334293 Some of the other families<br />won't sit still for a war.
4334293 4336461 - Then they hand me Sollozzo.<br />- Your father wouldn't hear this.
4336461 4339548 - This is business, not personal.<br />- They shot my father...Your ass...
4339631 4343051 Even shooting your father<br />was business, not personal, Sonny.
4343135 4344970 Well, then business will have to suffer.<br />All right?
4344970 4346805 And listen... do me a favor, Tom...
4346805 4348807 No more advice on how<br />to patch things up.
4348807 4351310 Just help me win, please.<br />All right?
4357274 4359818 I found out about this Captain McCluskey<br />who broke Mike's jaw.
4359943 4361445 What about him?
4361445 4364490 Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's<br />payroll, and for big money.
4364615 4367493 McCluskey has agreed<br />to be the Turk's bodyguard.
4367618 4369620 What you have to understand,<br />Sonny...
4369620 4371788 is that while Sollozzo's<br />being guarded like this...
4371788 4373624 he is invulnerable.
4373624 4377169 Nobody has ever gunned down<br />a New York police captain. Never.
4377294 4380339 It would be disastrous. All the<br />five families would come after you, Sonny.
4380464 4383175 The Corleone family<br />would be outcast.
4383300 4386970 Even the old man's political<br />protection would run for cover.
4388472 4390641 So do me a favor.
4390641 4393268 Take this into consideration.
4396063 4398565 All right, we'll wait.
4403320 4405823 We can't wait.
4405823 4407825 Can't wait.
4407825 4409576 I don't care what Sollozzo says<br />about a deal.
4409576 4411745 He's gonna kill Pop.<br />That's it.
4411745 4413580 That's the key for him.
4413580 4415582 Got to get Sollozzo.
4415582 4417751 CLEMENZA: Mike is right.
4417751 4419753 Let me ask you something first.
4419753 4422840 What about this McCluskey?
4422923 4425425 What do we do with this cop here?
4429763 4432266 They want to have a meeting<br />with me, right?
4433767 4436353 It will be me...
4436436 4438939 McCluskey and Sollozzo.
4439940 4442442 Let's set the meeting.
4444111 4447531 Get our informers to find out<br />where it's going to be held.
4449616 4453370 Now we insist it's a public place...<br />a bar, a restaurant.
4453453 4457207 Someplace where there's people,<br />so I feel safe.
4460127 4463046 They're gonna search me<br />when I first meet them, right?
4463130 4465632 So I can't have a weapon on me then.
4468802 4471305 But if Clemenza can figure a way...
4471430 4473891 to have a weapon<br />planted there for me...
4478770 4481231 then I'll kill them both.
4493118 4495662 What are you gonna do?<br />Nice college boy, huh?
4495787 4497789 Didn't want to get mixed up<br />in the family business.
4497789 4499791 Now you want to gun down<br />a police captain?
4499791 4501793 Why? 'Cause he slapped you<br />in the face a little bit?
4501793 4504129 What do you think this is, the army,<br />where you shoot them a mile away?
4504129 4505797 You've gotta<br />get up close like this and bada-bing!
4505797 4509176 You blow their brains all over your<br />nice Ivy League suit. Come here.
4509301 4511637 You're taking this very personal.
4511637 4514848 Tom, this is business, and this man<br />is taking it very, very personal.
4514973 4516975 Where does it say that<br />you can't kill a cop?
4516975 4519520 - Come on, Mikey.<br />- Tom, wait a minute.
4519645 4522356 I'm talking about a cop<br />that's mixed up in drugs.
4522481 4526610 I'm talking about a dishonest cop,<br />a crooked cop...
4526693 4529571 who got mixed up in the rackets<br />and got what was coming to him.
4529655 4531740 That's a terrific story.
4531740 4534451 Now we have newspaper people<br />on the payroll, don't we, Tom?
4535994 4538247 They might like a story like that.
4538247 4540749 They might.<br />They just might.
4543585 4545754 It's not personal, Sonny.
4545754 4548257 It's strictly business.
4550259 4551927 It's as cold as they come.
4551927 4555472 Impossible to trace, so you don't<br />worry about prints, Mike.
4555597 4558475 I put a special tape<br />on the trigger and the butt.
4558600 4561103 Here. Try it.
4571780 4574283 What's the matter,<br />the trigger too tight?
4577452 4579621 - My ears.<br />- I left it noisy.
4579621 4584334 Yeah, I left it noisy � that way it scares<br />any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders<br />away.
4584459 4586962 All right, you shot them both.<br />Now what do you do?
4589548 4591717 Sit down, finish my dinner.
4591717 4593385 Come on, kid.<br />Don't fool around.
4593385 4596972 Just let your hand drop to your side<br />and let the gun slip out.
4597055 4599224 Everybody will still think<br />you got it.
4599224 4601393 They're gonna be staring<br />at your face, Mike...
4601393 4604480 so walk out of the place real fast,<br />but you don't run.
4604563 4607983 Don't look nobody directly in the<br />eye, but you don't look away, either.
4608066 4610068 Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff<br />of you, believe me...
4610068 4612571 so don't worry about nothing.
4613739 4615574 You know, you're gonna turn out all right.
4615574 4617910 You take a long vacation,<br />nobody knows where...
4617910 4620412 and we're gonna catch the hell.
4620412 4622581 How bad do you think<br />it's gonna be?
4622581 4624583 Pretty goddamn bad.
4624583 4627669 Probably all the other families<br />will line up against us.
4627753 4630672 That's all right. These things<br />gotta happen every five years or so.
4630756 4633342 Ten years.<br />Helps to get rid of the bad blood.
4633425 4636011 Been ten years since<br />the last one.
4636094 4638096 You know, you gotta stop them<br />at the beginning...
4638096 4640265 like they should have<br />stopped Hitler at Munich.
4640265 4642267 They should have never let him<br />get away with that.
4642267 4644770 They was just asking<br />for big trouble.
4645103 4647689 You know, Mike,<br />we was all proud of you...
4647773 4649566 being a hero and all.
4649566 4652069 Your father too.
4689439 4691275 Nothing.<br />Not a hint.
4691275 4693777 Absolutely nothing.
4693944 4696822 Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br />where the meeting's gonna be held.
4698115 4700617 How much time do we have?
4701451 4703287 They're gonna pick you up in front of Jack<br />Dempsey's joint...
4703287 4705789 in an hour and a half...<br />exactly an hour and a half.
4707457 4709960 We could put a tail on them,<br />see how it turns out.
4710043 4713297 Sollozzo'll lose our ass<br />going around the block.
4713380 4714923 What about the negotiator?
4714923 4717634 He's over at my place playing<br />pinochle with a couple of my men.
4717718 4719511 He's happy.<br />They're letting him win.
4719511 4723140 It's too much of a risk for Mike.<br />Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.
4723265 4726810 The negotiator keeps on playing cards<br />until Mike comes back safe and sound.
4726935 4729229 So why don't they just blast who's ever<br />in the goddamn car?
4729229 4731231 Too dangerous.<br />They'll be looking for that.
4731231 4733734 Sollozzo might not<br />even be in the car, Sonny.
4734401 4736904 I get it.
4746246 4752753 Yeah...Yeah...Well, thanks...
4761094 4764515 - Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.<br />- Well is it reliable?
4764598 4766433 That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.
4766433 4769269 A police captain's got to be<br />on call 24 hours a day.
4769394 4772272 He signed out at that number<br />between 8:00 and 10:00.
4772397 4773941 Anybody know this joint?
4773941 4777361 Yeah, sure. I do.<br />It's perfect for us.
4777444 4779738 A small family place, good food.
4779738 4782533 Everyone minds his business.<br />It's perfect.
4782658 4785452 Pete, they got<br />an old-fashioned toilet...
4785577 4788789 You know, the box<br />and the chain thing.
4790415 4792960 We might be able<br />to tape the gun behind it.
4793085 4794586 All right.
4794586 4797714 Mike, you go to the restaurant.
4797840 4800259 You eat, you talk for a while,<br />you relax.
4800259 4801927 You make them relax.
4801927 4804304 Then you get up<br />and go take a leak.
4804304 4806974 No, better still,<br />you ask for permission to go.
4807099 4808934 And when you come back,<br />you come out blasting.
4808934 4811895 And don't take any chances.<br />Two shots in the head apiece.
4811979 4814106 Now, listen.<br />I want somebody good...
4814106 4816108 and I mean very good...<br />to plant that gun.
4816108 4819069 I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet<br />with just his dick in his hands, all right?
4819194 4820946 The gun will be there.
4820946 4825159 All right, listen. You drive him<br />and you pick him up after the job.
4825284 4827744 Come on. Let's move.
4827828 4830330 Thank you, Tom.
4832624 4835502 Did he tell you<br />to drop the gun right away?
4835627 4838088 Yeah, a million times.
4842301 4844761 Now, you don't forget...<br />two shots apiece in the head...
4844803 4846972 as soon as you<br />come out the door.
4846972 4849433 Let's go.
4852978 4855689 How long do you think it'll be<br />before I can come back?
4857649 4859818 At least a year, Mike.
4859818 4863363 Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,<br />you not seeing her before you leave...
4863489 4867868 and I'll get a message<br />to that girlfriend...
4867993 4870454 when I think the time is right.
4875667 4878128 Take care.
4880339 4882800 - See you, Mike.<br />- Okay, Tom.
4914623 4916625 I'm glad you came, Mike.
4916625 4919127 I hope we can<br />straighten everything out.
4919795 4922673 I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way<br />I wanted things to go at all.
4922756 4924633 It should have never happened.
4924633 4926802 I want to straighten<br />everything out tonight.
4926802 4929304 I don't want my father<br />bothered anymore.
4929304 4933350 He won't be, Mike.<br />I swear on my children he won't be.
4933475 4936687 But you got to keep an open mind<br />when we talk.
4936812 4939314 I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head<br />like your brother Sonny.
4939314 4941817 You can't talk business<br />with him.
4942985 4945487 He's a good kid.
4948824 4951326 I'm sorry about<br />the other night, Mike.
4952411 4954913 I gotta frisk you,<br />so turn around, huh?
4954913 4957416 On your knees, facing me.
4961253 4964173 I guess I'm getting<br />too old for my job.
4965257 4967342 Too grouchy.
4967342 4970012 Can't stand the aggravation.
4970095 4972598 You know how it is.
4973432 4975934 He's clean.
5001793 5004296 We're going to Jersey?
5005964 5008467 Maybe.
5033116 5035619 Nice work, Lou.
5072281 5074324 How's the Italian food<br />in this restaurant?
5074366 5076785 Good.<br />Try the veal.
5076785 5079288 - It's the best in the city.<br />- I'll have it.
5080789 5082791 <i>Understand?</i>
5115282 5117159 I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.
5117159 5119661 Go ahead.
5124541 5127044 - I'm sorry.<br />- Forget about it.
5130047 5137054 What happened to<br />your father was business.
5138055 5141058 I have much respect for your father...
5141058 5145062 but your father's thinking<br />is old fashioned.
5146063 5150943 You must understand why<br />I did what I did.
5151068 5154071 I understand these things.
5154571 5156281 I do.
5156281 5158784 You do.
5169253 5173549 Now we have to think about what happens
5173549 5178262 between you and the Tattaglias.
5178262 5182266 We have to work through
5182266 5186270 where we go from here.
5193777 5196280 How do I say...?
5198073 5200576 What I want...
5200742 5203245 what's most important to me...
5205581 5207749 is that I have a guarantee:
5207749 5209918 no more attempts<br />on my father's life.
5209918 5214131 What guarantees could I give you, Mike?<br />I am the hunted one.
5214756 5217801 I missed my chance.<br />You think too much of me, kid.
5217926 5220429 I'm not that clever.
5221597 5224099 All I want is a truce.
5230606 5234318 I have to go to the bathroom.<br />Is that all right?
5235611 5238113 You gotta go, you gotta go.
5243744 5245370 I frisked him.<br />He's clean.
5245370 5247873 Don't take too long.
5251043 5253545 I've frisked a thousand young punks.
5328871 5331373 Everything all right?
5332374 5334835 I respect myself...  understand?
5334877 5337838 And so I cannot allow your<br />father to hold me back.
5338672 5341675 What happened was unavoidable.
5342676 5345179 I had the unspoken support of<br />the other Dons.
5345179 5347639 If your father were in better health...
5347639 5350142 without his eldest son running things...
5483984 5485486 Hey, come on.
5485486 5487988 Come on. Let's go.
5543669 5546130 Joe, you take over.
5549007 5551468 Hi, Grandpa.
5562938 5565440 I love you, Grandpa.
5567442 5570154 I'm sorry, Pa.<br />He doesn't know you yet.
5571905 5574783 - Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.<br />- Okay.
5574783 5576952 "I hope you get red, Grandpa...
5576952 5578954 and I wish<br />I would see you soon.
5578954 5581456 Love, your grandson, Frank."
5583959 5586295 Go with your mother.
5586295 5588797 Go ahead.<br />Take 'em downstairs.
5594470 5596972 Go on, Carlo. You too.
5598307 5600809 Go on.
5603312 5606523 I got chicken cacciatore<br />for you, sweetheart.
5606648 5608525 - That's enough bread.<br />- I like bread.
5608567 5611028 I know, but how much can you eat?
5620579 5622581 What's the matter with you, Carlo?
5622581 5625083 Shut up and set the table.
5640265 5642851 Since McCluskey's killing...
5642935 5646355 the police have been cracking down<br />most of our operations.
5648106 5650609 And also the other families'.
5651109 5652903 Been a lot of bad blood.
5652945 5656406 They hit us, so we hit them back.
5657282 5659451 Through our contacts<br />in the newspapers...
5659451 5661787 we've been able to put out<br />a lot of material...
5661787 5665207 about McCluskey being linked<br />with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.
5666458 5668961 See, things are<br />starting to loosen up.
5669586 5674299 Dad, I'm sending Fredo<br />to Las Vegas...
5674424 5677010 under the protection<br />of Don Francesco of L.A.
5677136 5679096 I want him to rest.
5679096 5681598 I'm going to learn<br />the casino business.
5681598 5684101 Yeah.
5689773 5692276 Where is Michael?
5704121 5706707 It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
5709126 5712838 But he's safe. We're starting<br />to work to bring him back now.
5734568 5736737 I want you to find out where that ol' pimp<br />Tattaglia is hiding.
5736737 5738739 I want his ass now...<br />right now.
5738739 5740574 - Hey, Sonny.<br />- What?
5740574 5742409 Things are starting to loosen up<br />a little bit.
5742409 5745162 If you go after Tattaglia,<br />all hell's going to break loose.
5745245 5747247 Let the smoke clear.<br />Pop can negotiate.
5747247 5749750 No, Pop can't do nothing till<br />he's better. I'm gonna decide what's gonna be<br />done.
5749750 5751752 All right, but your war's<br />costing us a lot of money.
5751752 5753587 Nothing's coming in.<br />We can't do business.
5753587 5756340 Well neither can they.<br />Don't worry about it.
5756423 5758425 - We can't afford a stalemate.<br />- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.
5758425 5760427 I'm gonna end it<br />by killing that old bastard.
5760427 5762596 You're getting a great reputation.<br />I hope you're enjoying it.
5762596 5764264 Well you just do what I tell you to do!
5764264 5766433 Goddamn it, if I had a wartime<br />consigliere, a Sicilian,
5766433 5768435 I wouldn't be in this shape!
5768435 5770938 Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
5774274 5776777 I'm sorry.<br />I didn't mean that.
5777778 5780823 Mom made a little dinner.<br />It's Sunday.
5781782 5784535 Them niggers are having<br />a good time...
5784618 5786286 with our policy banks<br />up there in Harlem.
5786286 5790123 Driving them new Cadillacs,<br />paying 50% on a bet.
5790249 5793627 I knew that was gonna happen as soon<br />as they started making big money.
5793752 5797297 Look, Papa never talked business<br />at the table in front of the kids.
5797422 5800134 - Hey, shut up, Connie.<br />- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.
5800259 5803303 - You got that?<br />- Santino, don't interfere.
5805264 5807850 You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk<br />to you, maybe after dinner.
5807933 5809893 I could be doing a lot more<br />for the family.
5809935 5812396 We don't discuss business<br />at the table.
5859318 5860819 I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
5865324 5873832 Michele, Why are you so far from the<br />house? You know I'm responsible to your<br />father for your life.
5873832 5874833 I'm with Calo and Fabrizio...
5874917 5884843 It's still dangerous. We've heard from<br />Santino in New York. Your enemies know<br />you're here.
5884927 5887846 Did Santino say when I can go back?
5887930 5892851 Not yet. It's out of the question.
5893143 5894520 Grazie.
5895145 5896522 Where are you going now?
5897356 5899858 Corleone.
5900359 5901819 Take my car...
5904029 5905531 No. I want to walk.
5908033 5909535 Accura! Be careful!
5929346 5931348 Look there. Corleone.
5943944 5945320 Where have all the men gone?
5945529 5947156 They're dead from vendettas.

6039206 6041208 A bottle of wine.

6054888 6059893 One of them struck our friend like a<br />thunderbolt.

6119912 6123582 Let's go. It's his daughter.
6124917 6125584 Tell him to come here.
6126001 6128587 You don't understand. It's his daughter!

6152694 6153612 Si, Signor.

6159827 6162329 I'm a stranger in this country...
6162830 6165749 and I meant no disrespect<br />to you or your daughter.
6171505 6174007 I'm an American hiding in Sicily.
6175676 6178178 My name is Michael Corleone.
6180013 6182683 There are people who would pay<br />a lot of money for that information.
6186520 6189022 But then your daughter<br />would lose a father...
6190983 6193485 instead of gaining a husband.
6201201 6203704 I want to meet your daughter...
6204538 6206373 with your permission...
6206373 6208876 and under the supervision<br />of your family...
6209835 6212337 with all respect.

6323615 6326118 What's the problem with your eye.
6326618 6329121 No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.
6403821 6406323 Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.
6411829 6414331 Save it for the library.
6417459 6419962 Come on. We gotta go<br />pick up my sister. Let's go.
6438188 6440691 What's the matter?
6442484 6444486 What's the matter?
6445696 6447865 - It was my fault!<br />- Where is he?
6447865 6451243 Sonny, please. It was my fault.<br />Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.
6451368 6453287 I started a fight with him.<br />Please, Sonny.
6453287 6455789 I'm sorry.
6459751 6463088 Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a<br />doctor to come and take a look at you.
6463297 6466049 Sonny, please don't do anything.<br />Please, don't do it.
6468135 6470304 What's the matter with you?<br />What am I gonna do?
6470304 6473098 Am I gonna make that baby an orphan<br />before he's born?
6475976 6477478 All right?
6477478 6480564 This fat slob's still bettin' the Yankees<br />pretty heavy?
6480689 6483192 You tell 'em to stop takin'<br />action on 'em, alright?
6484359 6486862 You lost enough money<br />last weekend to me.
6492743 6495245 Carlo, come here.
6552344 6555055 You touch my sister again,<br />I'll kill you.
6790415 6793127 Weren't expecting you, Kay.<br />You should call.
6793252 6797548 Yes, well, I have.<br />I mean I've tried writing and calling.
6797631 6800008 Now, I wanna reach Michael.
6800008 6803428 Nobody knows where he is. We know<br />that he's all right, but that's all.
6806682 6808684 - What was that?<br />- That's an accident.
6808684 6811395 But nobody was hurt.
6811436 6812437 Tom...
6812938 6816775 Would you give this letter<br />to Michael, please? Please?
6816900 6819236 Well, if I accepted that...
6819236 6822781 in a court of law they could prove that<br />I have knowledge of his whereabouts.
6822906 6825117 Now you just be patient, Kay.<br />He'll get in touch with you, all right?
6825117 6828996 I let my cab go, so can I come in<br />to call another one, please?
6829121 6831623 Come on. I'm sorry.<br />Come on.
6847931 6850434 Hello?
6851977 6853770 <i>Is Carlo there?</i>
6853770 6856231 <i>- Who's this?</i><br />- This is a friend of Carlo's.
6856231 6859276 <i>Would you tell him that</i><br />I can't make it tonight until later?
6865491 6867993 Bitch.
6868786 6871371 - Dinner's on the table.<br />- I'm not hungry yet.
6871497 6873499 Your food is on the table.<br />It's getting cold.
6873499 6876543 - I'll eat out later.<br />- You just told me to make you dinner.

6910577 6913080 Maybe I will.<br />Why not?
6918752 6921213 - Now clean it up!<br />- Like hell I will!

6941817 6944903 Yeah yeah...	Come on, now! Kill me!<br />Be a murderer like your father!
6945028 6947364 - Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!<br />- I hate you!
6947364 6949074 - Come on!<br />- I'll kill you!
6949074 6951577 - Come on! Kill me!<br />Get up!

6958834 6961336 Get out here!
6970179 6973098 Connie, what's the matter?<br />I can't hear you. What is it?
6974266 6977144 Honey, talk louder.<br />The baby's crying.
6977269 6979271 Santino, I can't understand.<br />I don't know.
6979271 6981356 I don't understand.
6981356 6983859 Yeah, Connie.
6988405 6990908 Listen, you wait there.
6992785 6995245 No, you just wait there.
6997080 6999958 - That son of a bitch.<br />- Sonny, what's the matter?
7000083 7002211 - Son of a bitch!<br />- What's the matter?
7002211 7004713 Damn it!
7006882 7009510 Open the goddamn gate.<br />Get off your ass.
7026026 7028862 - Sonny, come on!<br />- Get out of here!
7028987 7031448 Go after him.<br />Go on.
7059852 7061812 Son of a bitch.
7061812 7064314 Come on! Come on!
7171380 7173882 Give me a drop.
7181473 7183976 My wife is crying upstairs.
7186145 7188647 I hear cars coming to the house.
7193235 7195737 Consigliere of mine...
7196613 7199533 I think you should tell your Don<br />what everyone seems to know.
7199658 7202119 Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.
7203328 7206874 I was about to come up and wake you<br />just now and tell you.
7210002 7212504 But you needed a drink first.
7219094 7221597 Now you've had your drink.
7227144 7231315 They shot Sonny on the causeway.<br />He's dead.
7248582 7251084 I want all inquiries made.
7255255 7257758 I want no acts of vengeance.
7259301 7261804 I want you to arrange a meeting...
7263096 7265599 with the heads<br />of the five families.
7267851 7270354 This war stops now.
7291792 7294336 Call Bonasera.
7294419 7296922 We need him now.
7308767 7311770 This is Tom Hagen<br />calling for Vito Corleone...
7311854 7313939 at his request.
7313939 7316275 Now, you owe your Don a service.
7316275 7320070 <i>He has no doubt that</i><br />you will repay it.
7320195 7322948 <i>Now, he will be at your</i><br />funeral parlor in one hour.
7323073 7325576 <i>Be there to greet him.</i>
7345804 7348140 Well, my friend...
7348140 7350601 are you ready<br />to do me this service?
7350601 7352269 Yes.
7352269 7354771 What do you want me to do?
7362154 7365157 I want you to use<br />all your powers...
7365282 7367785 and all your skills.
7370788 7373290 I don't want his mother<br />to see him this way.
7389848 7392309 Look how they massacred my boy.
7424842 7425362 It's safer to teach you English!
7425843 7426343 I know English...
7427219 7429096 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...
7429096 7431723 Wednesday, Friday,<br />Sunday, Saturday.
7442109 7443735 How are things in Palermo?
7450117 7455539 Michael is teaching me to drive � watch,<br />I'll show you.
7459084 7461044 Young people don't respect anything<br />anymore. Times are changing for the worse.<br />This place has become too dangerous for<br />you. I don't think you're safe here. I<br />want you to move to a villa near Siracusa,<br />right now...Subita, eh?
7485110 7486528 What's wrong?
7488113 7496538 Bad news from America. Your brother,<br />Santino, they killed him.
7501084 7502274 Michele...Michele, Let's go... let's go...<br />you promised me.
7524149 7526610 - Fabrizio.<br />- Yes, sir?
7527778 7529446 Are you driving yourself, boss?
7529446 7531740 - Yes.<br />- Is your wife coming with you?
7531740 7535285 No. I want you to take her to her father's<br />house till I know things are safe.
7535410 7537913 Okay. Anything you say, boss.
7545087 7545897 Calo, dov� Apollonia?
7546088 7547178 She's going to surprise you � she wants to<br />drive.
7552094 7553024 She'll make a good American wife.
7556098 7556988 Wait, I'll get the baggage...
7573115 7574125 Michele, wait there! I'll drive to you...
7582082 7582862 NO! No, Apollonia!
7606940 7608901 Don Barzini,<br />I want to thank you...
7608901 7612404 for helping me organize<br />this meeting here today.
7612529 7615866 And also the other heads<br />of the five families...
7615991 7618494 from New York and New Jersey.
7619495 7622498 Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.
7625000 7627503 And Brooklyn...
7627669 7630172 Philip Tattaglia.
7631590 7634384 And from Staten Island...
7634510 7637763 we have with us Victor Strachi.
7637888 7640390 And all the other associates<br />that came as far...
7640432 7643560 as from California<br />and Kansas City...
7643685 7646104 and all the other territories<br />of the country.
7646104 7648607 Thank you.
7654238 7656740 How did things ever get so far?
7657783 7660244 I don't know.
7661495 7664998 It was so unfortunate<br />and so unnecessary.
7668085 7670295 Tattaglia lost a son...
7670295 7672798 and I lost a son.
7673549 7677136 We're quits,<br />and if Tattaglia agrees...
7677261 7681306 then I'm willing to let things<br />go on the way they were before.
7682975 7686478 We are all grateful to Don Corleone<br />for calling this meeting.
7686603 7689273 We all know him<br />as a man of his word.
7689398 7691650 A modest man.<br />He'll always listen to reason.
7691650 7694111 Yes, Don Barzini.
7694153 7696238 He's too modest.
7696238 7699199 He had all the judges<br />and politicians in his pocket.
7700617 7703454 He refused to share them.
7703537 7706540 When did I ever refuse<br />an accommodation?
7707416 7709918 All of you know me here.
7710794 7714798 When did I ever refuse,<br />except one time?
7714923 7717426 And why?
7717593 7720095 Because I believe<br />this drug business...
7720179 7723307 is going to destroy us<br />in the years to come.
7723432 7727144 I mean, it's not like gambling<br />or liquor or even women...
7727269 7729980 which is something that<br />most people want nowadays...
7730105 7733567 and is forbidden to them by<br />the pezzonovante of the church.
7733692 7736778 Even the police departments<br />that have helped us in the past...
7736862 7738697 with gambling and other things...
7738697 7742826 are gonna refuse to help us<br />when it comes to narcotics.
7742951 7745871 And I believed that then...
7745996 7748123 and I believe that now.
7748123 7750417 Times have changed.
7750417 7752711 It's not like the old days...
7752711 7755172 when we could do<br />anything we want.
7755214 7758133 A refusal is not the act of a friend.
7758217 7762179 If Don Corleone had all the judges<br />and the politicians in New York...
7762262 7765265 then he must share them<br />or let others use them.
7765390 7768519 He must let us draw<br />the water from the well.
7769478 7773023 Certainly, he can present a bill<br />for such services.
7773148 7775859 After all, we are not Communists.
7778862 7781907 I also don't believe in drugs.
7782032 7784243 For years,<br />I paid my people extra...
7784243 7786662 so they wouldn't do<br />that kind of business.
7786662 7790082 Somebody comes to them and says,<br />"I have powders.
7790207 7792918 If you put up a three, four<br />thousand dollar investment,
7793919 7796547 we can make 50,000 distributing."
7797673 7801468 So they can't resist. I want<br />to control it as a business...
7801593 7804054 to keep it respectable.
7804054 7808559 I don't want it near schools.<br />I don't want it sold to children.
7808684 7811186 That's an infamia.
7811728 7815649 In my city, we would keep the traffic<br />in the dark people, the colored.
7815774 7818610 They're animals anyway,<br />so let them lose their souls.
7825617 7828912 I hoped that we could come here<br />and reason together.
7830622 7833792 And as a reasonable man, I'm willing<br />to do whatever's necessary...
7833917 7837379 to find a peaceful solution<br />to these problems.
7837504 7839673 Then we are agreed.
7839673 7842134 The traffic in drugs<br />will be permitted, but controlled.
7842134 7844678 And Don Corleone will give our<br />protection in the east...
7844803 7846722 and there will be the peace.
7846722 7850601 But I must have strict assurance<br />from Corleone.
7850684 7853854 As time goes by and<br />his position becomes stronger...
7853979 7856482 will he attempt<br />any individual vendetta?
7856607 7858650 Look, we are all<br />reasonable men here.
7858650 7862112 We don't have to give assurances<br />as if we were lawyers.
7862196 7864448 You talk about vengeance.
7864448 7867701 Is vengeance gonna bring<br />your son back to you?
7867826 7870287 Or my boy to me?
7870996 7873457 I forgo the vengeance of my son.
7876627 7879129 But I have selfish reasons.
7881131 7883175 My youngest son...
7883175 7885636 was forced to leave this country...
7886678 7889139 because of this Sollozzo business.
7889640 7892476 All right.<br />And I have to make arrangements...
7892559 7897189 to bring him back here safely,<br />cleared of all these false charges.
7898857 7901860 But I'm a superstitious man.
7901985 7904530 And if some unlucky accident<br />should befall him...
7904655 7908367 if he should get shot<br />in the head by a police officer...
7908492 7912329 or if he should hang himself<br />in his jail cell...
7912412 7914915 of if he's struck<br />by a bolt of lightening...
7916542 7919586 then I'm going to blame<br />some of the people in this room.
7921797 7924299 And that I do not forgive.
7926635 7929138 But that aside...
7932057 7934560 let me say that I swear...
7936019 7939106 on the souls of my grandchildren...
7939231 7942734 that I will not be the one to break<br />the peace we've made here today.
7969136 7971138 When I meet with the Tattaglia<br />people, should I insist...
7971138 7974516 that all these drug middlemen<br />have clean records?
7974600 7977102 Mention it.<br />Don't insist.
7978937 7981440 Barzini is a man who'll know that<br />without being told.
7982774 7985402 You mean Tattaglia.
7985486 7988238 Tattaglia's a pimp.
7988322 7990824 He never could've outfought Santino.
7994161 7997831 But I didn't know until this day<br />that it was...
7997956 8000417 Barzini all along.
8015098 8017601 Come on, Nancy.
8018310 8020771 Keep together, everyone.<br />Brian?
8022147 8024650 Okay. All right.
8037204 8039748 How long have you been back?
8039832 8042334 I've been back a year.
8043293 8045796 Longer than that, I think.
8048048 8050551 It's good to see you, Kay.
8056473 8058976 Hi, Miss Adams!
8061311 8063814 I'm working for my father now, Kay.
8066441 8068485 He's been sick.
8068485 8070904 Very sick.
8070904 8073031 But you're not like him, Michael.
8073031 8075534 I thought you weren't going<br />to become a man like your father.
8075659 8078162 That's what you told me.
8078704 8081415 My father's no different<br />than any other powerful man.
8083083 8086670 Any man who's responsible<br />for other people.
8087754 8090257 Like a senator or a president.
8090257 8092801 - Do you know how naive you sound?<br />- Why?
8092885 8095512 Senators and presidents<br />don't have men killed.
8096847 8097848 Oh.
8098849 8101351 Who's being naive, Kay?
8101977 8104229 Kay, my father's way<br />of doing things is over.
8104229 8107691 It's finished.<br />Even he knows that.
8107816 8109860 I mean, in five years<br />the Corleone family...
8109860 8112362 is going to be completely legitimate.
8114114 8116992 Trust me. That's all I can tell you<br />about my business.
8116992 8117993 Kay.
8119453 8121830 Michael, why did you come here?
8121830 8124041 Why?
8124041 8126084 What do you want with me<br />after all this time...
8126084 8128629 without even calling or writing?
8128754 8130756 I came here because I need you.
8130756 8133258 - Because I care for you.<br />- Please stop it, Michael.
8133383 8136512 Because I want you to marry me.
8138013 8140516 - It's too late. It's too late.<br />- Please. Kay.
8142226 8146063 I'll do anything you ask, anything to<br />make up for what's happened to us.
8147898 8150234 Because that's important, Kay.
8150234 8153695 Because what's important is that...
8153821 8155656 we have each other.
8155656 8158575 That we have a life together.
8158659 8162121 That we have children.<br />Our children.
8162621 8163622 Kay...
8164289 8167000 I need you...
8167126 8169586 and I love you.
8190732 8192734 Barzini's people<br />chisel my territory...
8192734 8194611 and we do nothing about it.
8194611 8197281 Pretty soon, there won't be one place<br />in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
8197322 8199867 - Just be patient.<br />- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.
8199992 8202494 - Just take off the handcuffs.<br />- Be patient.
8202619 8204746 We gotta protect ourselves.
8204746 8206748 Give me a chance to recruit<br />some new men.
8206748 8208375 No.
8208375 8210878 I don't wanna give Barzini<br />an excuse to start fighting.
8210961 8213464 Mike, you're wrong.
8213589 8217217 Don Corleone, you once said<br />that the day would come...
8217342 8220012 when Tessio and me<br />could form our own family.
8220137 8222139 Till today,<br />I would never think of it.
8222139 8224516 I must ask your permission.
8224516 8227728 Well, Michael is now<br />head of the family...
8227853 8230522 and if he gives his permission,<br />then you have my blessing.
8232107 8234610 After we make the move to Nevada...
8234693 8237696 you can break off from the Corleone<br />family and go on your own.
8237821 8240616 - After we make the move to Nevada.<br />- How long will that be?
8241867 8243494 Six months.
8243494 8246955 Forgive me, Godfather,<br />but with you gone...
8247039 8250042 me and Pete'll come under<br />Barzini's thumb sooner or later.
8250125 8252628 And I hate that goddamn Barzini.
8252669 8255589 In six months' time, there won't be<br />nothing left to build on.
8255714 8258675 - You have faith in my judgment?<br />- Yes.
8258801 8261595 - Do I have your loyalty?<br />- Yes, always, Godfather.
8261720 8263972 Then be a friend to Michael...
8263972 8266475 and do as he says.
8269895 8272105 There are things being negotiated<br />now that are going to solve...
8272105 8275192 all your problems<br />and answer all your questions.
8275317 8277820 That's all I can tell you now.
8278320 8280948 Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
8281073 8284201 When we make our move there,<br />you're gonna be my right-hand man.
8284326 8287037 Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.
8287121 8289623 He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.
8289623 8292084 That's no reflection on Tom,<br />but that's the way I want it.
8292084 8294044 Besides, if I ever need help...
8294044 8296338 who's a better consigliere<br />than my father?
8296338 8298841 Now that's it.
8316942 8319403 - Thank you, Papa.<br />- I'm happy for you, Carlo.
8320821 8325075 Mike, ehh...<br />Why am I out?
8325159 8327661 You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.
8329246 8331748 Things may get rough<br />with the move we're trying.
8332416 8333417 Tom...
8339006 8341300 I advised Michael.
8341300 8344178 I never thought<br />you were a bad consigliere.
8344303 8347556 I thought Santino was a bad Don...
8347639 8349933 rest in peace.
8349933 8352936 Michael has all my confidence,<br />as, as you do.
8354146 8357691 But there are reasons why<br />you must have no part...
8357816 8360027 in what is going to happen.
8360027 8361528 Maybe I could help.
8361528 8364031 You're out, Tom.
8412454 8414957 I can't get over the way<br />your face looks.
8415082 8418252 It really looks good.<br />This doctor did some job.
8418377 8421004 Who talked you into it, Kay?<br />Hey, hey, wait.
8421088 8423507 Leave them out here.<br />We'll deal with them later.
8423507 8425509 He's tired.<br />He wants to clean up.
8425509 8428554 All right now, let me open the door.<br />All right?
8434101 8436436 Hello, Mike.<br />Welcome to Las Vegas.
8436436 8439690 All for you, kid.<br />It was all his idea, right?
8439815 8442609 - Well, your brother, Freddy...<br />- It was... Girls?
8446363 8449158 I'll be right back.<br />You keep them occupied.
8449241 8452202 That a boy.<br />Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?
8452286 8454788 Who are the girls?
8455372 8457374 That's for you to find out.
8457374 8460210 Get rid of them, Fredo.
8460335 8462463 - Hey, Mike...<br />- Fredo, I'm here on business.
8462463 8466216 I leave tomorrow.<br />Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.
8466300 8468802 Get rid of the band too.
8473765 8476560 Hey, just take off.<br />Come on. Let's go.
8476685 8479938 Hey, that's it.<br />Hey, Angelo, that's it.
8480063 8482065 Let's go.<br />Hey, come on!
8482107 8484568 Scram!
8484860 8487237 Come on, honey. Let's go.<br />I don't know, Johnny.
8487237 8489406 I don't know what the hell's<br />the matter with him. I'm sorry.
8489406 8491700 It's all right, Freddy.
8491700 8494203 I don't know.<br />He's tired, he's hot.
8501210 8503712 What happened to Moe Greene?
8504296 8506799 He said he had some business.<br />He said give him a call...
8506799 8508801 when the party started.
8508801 8511261 Well, give him a call.
8512095 8515182 - Johnny, how are you?<br />- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.
8515307 8517434 - We're all proud of you.<br />- Thanks, Mike.
8517476 8519853 Sit down, Johnny.<br />I want to talk to you.
8519853 8524274 - The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.<br />- Well, I, owe it all to him.
8524399 8526443 Well, he knows<br />how grateful you are.
8526443 8529488 That's why he'd like to ask<br />a favor of you.
8529613 8532116 Mike, what can I do?
8532908 8535452 The Corleone family is thinking<br />of giving up all its interests...
8535494 8538872 in the olive oil business,<br />settling out here.
8538997 8542251 Now, Moe Greene will sell us his<br />share of the casino and the hotel...
8542334 8544962 so it can be completely owned<br />by the family. Tom?
8545045 8547339 Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?
8547339 8550217 Moe loves the business. He never<br />said nothin' to me about sellin'.
8550342 8552803 Well, I'll make him an offer<br />he can't refuse.
8554555 8556974 See, Johnny...
8557015 8559309 see, we figure that entertainment<br />will be a big factor...
8559309 8561103 in drawing gamblers to the casino.
8561103 8564398 Now we hope you'll sign a contract<br />to appear five times a year.
8567901 8571155 Perhaps convince some of<br />your friends in the movies...
8571280 8573782 to do the same.
8573866 8576326 We're counting on you.
8577953 8580456 Sure, Mike.<br />I'll do anything for my godfather.
8580581 8581915 You know that.
8581915 8584418 Good.
8584543 8586795 Hey, Mike.<br />Hello, fellas.
8586795 8590507 Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.<br />Good to see you, Mike.
8590591 8592634 - How are you, Moe?<br />- You got everything you want?
8592634 8595345 The chef cooked for you special, the<br />dancers will kick your tongue out...
8595429 8597181 and your credit is good.
8597222 8599850 Draw chips for everybody in the room<br />so they can play on the house.
8603395 8605898 My credit good enough<br />to buy you out?
8607900 8609818 Buy me out?
8609818 8612488 The casino. The hotel.
8612571 8615365 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy you out.
8615449 8618327 The Corleone family<br />wants to buy me out?
8618410 8620913 No, I buy you out.<br />You don't buy me out.
8620954 8624208 Your casino loses money.<br />Maybe we can do better.
8624333 8626835 You think I'm skimming<br />off the top, Mike?
8627628 8630130 You're unlucky.
8633300 8635761 You goddamn guineas<br />really make me laugh.
8635761 8638597 I do you a favor and take Freddy in<br />when you're having a bad time.
8638722 8641183 - And then you try to push me out!<br />- Wait a minute.
8641183 8643769 You took Freddy in because<br />the Corleone family...
8643894 8646396 bankrolled your casino,<br />because the Molinari family...
8646480 8648607 on the coast guaranteed his safety.
8648607 8650692 Now, we're talkin' business.<br />Let's talk business.
8650692 8653403 Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.<br />First of all, you're all done.
8653529 8655989 The Corleone family don't even have<br />that kind of muscle anymore.
8655989 8658492 The Godfather's sick, right? You're<br />getting chased out of New York...
8658534 8660327 by Barzini and the other families.
8660327 8664248 What do you think is going on here? You think<br />you can come to my hotel and take over?
8664331 8666166 I talked to Barzini.
8666166 8669419 I can make a deal with him<br />and still keep my hotel.
8669545 8672131 Is that why you slapped<br />my brother around in public?
8673215 8674925 Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.
8675217 8677761 Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.
8677886 8680389 Sure he flies off the handle<br />once in a while...
8680389 8682516 but Moe and me,<br />we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?
8682516 8684393 I got a business to run.
8684393 8687104 I gotta kick asses sometimes<br />to make it run right.
8687229 8691233 We had a little argument, Freddy and I,<br />so I had to straighten him out.
8691316 8693944 You straightened my brother out?
8694027 8696530 He was banging cocktail waitresses<br />two at a time!
8696530 8699450 Players couldn't get a drink at the table.<br />What's wrong with you?
8705497 8708959 I leave for New York tomorrow.<br />Think about a price.
8709084 8710794 Son of a bitch.
8710794 8713797 Do you know who I am?<br />I'm Moe Greene.
8713922 8716508 I made my bones when you were<br />going out with cheerleaders.
8716633 8719136 Wait a minute, Moe.<br />Moe, I got an idea.
8720137 8723307 Tom, you're the consigliere.<br />Now, you can talk to the Don.
8723432 8725434 - You can explain...<br />- Just a minute.
8725434 8729021 The Don is semiretired and Mike is<br />in charge of the family business now.
8729146 8731690 If you have anything to say,<br />say it to Michael.
8736570 8741158 Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and<br />talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
8743535 8748248 Fredo. You're my older brother,<br />and I love you.
8749750 8751835 But don't ever take sides<br />with anyone...
8751835 8754713 against the family again...
8754838 8757341 ever.
8764139 8766308 I have to see my father<br />and his people.
8766308 8768811 - So have dinner without me.<br />- Oh, Michael.
8770312 8772564 This weekend we'll go out.<br />We'll go to the city.
8772564 8775067 We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.<br />I promise.
8782533 8785410 Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants<br />to ask you something.
8785536 8787663 - Well, let her ask.<br />- No, she's afraid to.
8787663 8790874 Connie and Carlo want you to be<br />godfather to their little boy.
8790999 8792876 - Oh, we'll see.<br />- Will you?
8792876 8795379 Let me think about it. We'll see.<br />Come on.
8801969 8803887 So...
8803929 8806890 Barzini will move against you first.
8806974 8811311 He'll set up a meeting with<br />someone that you absolutely trust...
8811436 8813897 guaranteeing your safety.
8814773 8818026 And at that meeting,<br />you'll be assassinated.
8822656 8825868 I like to drink wine<br />more than I used to.
8827035 8829204 Anyway, I'm drinking more.
8829204 8831707 It's good for you, Pop.
8835627 8838130 I don't know.
8839047 8841550 Your wife and children,<br />are you happy with them?
8842968 8845012 Very happy.
8845012 8847556 That's good.
8847639 8849933 I hope you don't mind<br />the way I...
8849933 8852519 I keep going over<br />this Barzini business.
8852644 8854688 No, not at all.
8854688 8857065 It's an old habit.
8857065 8859818 I spent my life<br />tryin' not to be careless.
8861695 8864531 Women and children can be careless,<br />but not men.
8868410 8870954 - How's your boy?<br />- He's good.
8871079 8873582 You know, he looks<br />more like you every day.
8876376 8878629 He's smarter than I am.
8878670 8881131 Three years old,<br />he can read the funny papers.
8882966 8885469 Reads the funny papers.
8892184 8894686 I want you to arrange<br />to have a telephone man...
8894686 8897815 check all the calls that go<br />in and out of here.
8897940 8900067 - I did it already, Pop.<br />- Could be anyone.
8900067 8903612 - Pop, I took care of that.<br />- Oh, that's right. I forgot.
8907324 8909701 What's the matter?
8909701 8912204 What's bothering you?
8914998 8917501 I'll handle it.
8917876 8920379 I told you I can handle it,<br />I'll handle it.
8933433 8937771 I knew that Santino was gonna<br />have to go through all this...
8937896 8939773 and Fredo...
8939773 8942234 Well...
8942234 8944736 Fredo was...
8946280 8949032 But I never, I never wanted this for you.
8951326 8954163 I worked my whole life...<br />I don't apologize...
8954246 8956415 to take care of my family...
8956415 8960294 and I refused to be a fool...
8960419 8964465 dancing on a string<br />held by all those big shots.
8966592 8969720 I don't apologize. That's my life.<br />But I thought that...
8971722 8974308 that when it was your time...
8974433 8976894 that you would be the one<br />to hold the strings.
8978770 8981231 Senator Corleone.
8982232 8984401 Governor Corleone.<br />Something.
8984401 8986904 Another pezzonovante.
8992409 8996246 Just wasn't enough time, Michael.<br />Wasn't enough time.
8996330 8998916 We'll get there, Pop.
8999041 9001543 We'll get there.
9004797 9009134 Now listen. Whoever comes to you<br />with this Barzini meeting...
9009259 9011011 he's the traitor.
9011011 9013514 Don't forget that.
9029279 9031782 Put it over the tree.
9046547 9049007 - Can I water these?<br />- Yeah.
9049007 9050592 That's fine.
9050592 9053095 Over here.<br />Over here.
9055180 9057683 Be careful.<br />You're spilling it.
9064022 9066483 Anthony, come here.
9071905 9074408 Go ahead. That's right.<br />We'll put it right there.
9080205 9082708 I'll show you something.<br />Come here.
9085210 9087713 Now, you stand there.
9090841 9093343 Give me an orange!
9110903 9113405 That's a new trick.
9113989 9116533 You run in there.<br />Run in there.
9129171 9131673 - Where are you?<br />- Who?
9164790 9167292 Ouch!
9308851 9311353 Mike, can I have a minute?
9321697 9324158 Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
9324158 9326660 He says we can straighten<br />any of our problems out.
9328328 9330831 - You talked to him?<br />- Yeah.
9331748 9334209 I can arrange security...
9334209 9336712 on my territory.
9338630 9340632 All right?
9340632 9343469 - All right.<br />- All right.
9358776 9361278 Do you know how<br />they're gonna come at you?
9364198 9366617 They're arranging a meeting<br />in Brooklyn.
9366658 9369119 Tessio's ground...
9369995 9372498 where I'll be safe.
9384051 9387638 I always thought it would've been<br />Clemenza, not Tessio.
9387763 9390140 It's the smart move.
9390140 9392643 Tessio was always smarter.
9393811 9396146 But I'm gonna wait.
9396146 9398649 After the baptism.
9400609 9403153 I've decided to be godfather<br />to Connie's baby.
9404530 9407449 And then I'll meet<br />with Don Barzini...
9407533 9409993 and Tattaglia...
9409993 9412496 all the heads<br />of the five families.
9439022 9441024 Go forth from him, unclean spirit,
9441233 9444403 and give place to the Holy Spirit,<br />the Spirit of God.
9446405 9447406 Let us pray.
9447406 9450409 Our prayers through through<br />Christ our Lord. So be it.
9451034 9452035 Michael.
9452035 9455038 Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,
9456039 9459001 so that, preserving this first experience<br />of the greatness of thy glory,
9459042 9462004 he may deserve, by keeping<br />thy commandments,
9462004 9465007 <i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>
9465007 9468010 <i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>
9468010 9471013 <i>Let us pray.</i><br />Almighty, everlasting God,
9471013 9473515 <i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>
9473515 9476518 <i>look graciously down upon this,</i><br />thy servant, Michael.
9476518 9479521 Who shall come to judge the living<br />and the dead,
9479521 9482524 and the world by fire. So be it.
9482524 9484818 Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.
9484818 9487112 Let it be to thee a token of mercy<br />unto everlasting life.
9487112 9489114 May it make your way easy to eternal life.<br />So be it.
9489114 9491617 May the almighty God, the Father<br />of our Lord Jesus Christ,
9491617 9494119 <i>Who hath regenerated thee by water</i><br />and the Holy Spirit,
9495120 9497623 <i>and who hath given thee the</i><br />remission of all thy sins,
9498123 9501627 <i>may he, himself anoint thee with</i><br />the Chrism of Salvation,
9501627 9504630 <i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,</i><br />unto life eternal. So be it.
9505631 9508926 I annoint you with the oil of salvation<br />in Christ Jesus our Lord,
9509259 9512221 that you may have everlasting life.<br />So be it.
9519645 9522648 <i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,</i><br />the Holy Catholic Church,
9522648 9525651 <i>the communion of Saints,</i><br />the forgiveness of sins,
9525651 9529154 <i>the resurrection of the body</i><br />and life everlasting? I do believe.
9530155 9533158 I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,<br />in the name of the Father,
9533158 9536161 and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
9536161 9540165 that thou goest out and depart from<br />this servant of God, Michael.
9540165 9543627 For he commands thee, accursed one,
9545462 9548465 Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.
9548465 9551468 Be thou, devil, begone,
9551468 9553762 for the judgment of God shall draw near.
9553804 9556682 Michael, do you believe in God,<br />the Father almighty...
9556807 9559768 - creator of Heaven and Earth?<br />- I do.
9559852 9563147 <i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,</i><br />his only Son, our Lord?
9563272 9564773 <i>I do.</i>
9564773 9568944 <i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,</i><br />the Holy Catholic Church?
9568944 9569945 <i>I do.</i>
9570237 9574158 <i>Our Father, who art in heaven,</i><br />hallowed be thy name.
9574158 9578162 <i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,</i><br />on earth as it is in heaven.
9578162 9580956 <i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>
9580956 9582958 <i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>
9583125 9586253 <i>as we forgive them that</i><br />trespass against us.
9586253 9589256 <i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>
9589256 9591258 <i>but deliver us from evil.</i><br />So be it.
9591258 9592759 Michael.
9592759 9595762 Enter thou into the temple of God,
9595762 9598724 that thou mayest have part with Christ<br />unto life everlasting. So be it.
9598724 9601226 I believe in God the Father almighty,
9601226 9603228 Creator of heaven and earth,
9603228 9606732 <i>and in Jesus Christ his only</i><br />son our Lord,
9606732 9609067 <i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>
9609067 9611028 <i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>
9611069 9614364 <i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,</i><br />was crucified, dead, and buried.

9617034 9621038 <i>He rose again from the dead.</i><br />He ascended into heaven,
9621038 9623832 <i>and sitteth at the right hand of</i><br />God the Father almighty,
9623874 9626335 <i>from thence shall he come to judge</i><br />the living and the dead.

9635219 9640182 Michael Francis Rizzi,<br />do you renounce Satan?
9646563 9649066 I do renounce him.
9657407 9659910 And all his works?
9672089 9674591 I do renounce them.
9679471 9683434 - And all his pomps?<br />- I do renounce them.
9698824 9702911 Michael Rizzi,<br />will you be baptized?
9702995 9704997 I will.
9704997 9707291 In the name of the Father,
9707291 9709293 <i>and of the Son,</i>
9709293 9711712 <i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>
9712045 9714590 <i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>
9714715 9717759 And may the Lord be with you.<br />So be it.
9759843 9761845 - Carlo.<br />- What?
9761845 9764097 Can't go to Vegas.<br />Something's come up.
9764097 9766141 Everybody's gonna have to leave<br />without us.
9766141 9768685 - It's our first vacation together.<br />- Connie, please.
9768811 9770813 - What do you wanna do?<br />- Go back to the house.
9770813 9773690 Wait for my call.<br />It's important.
9773774 9776276 I'll only be a couple of days.
9778695 9781198 Have a nice trip, Mama.
9792209 9794711 We're on our way to Brooklyn.
9796547 9798966 I hope Mike can get us<br />a good deal tonight.
9798966 9801468 I'm sure he will.
9808225 9811228 Sal, Tom, the boss says<br />he'll come in a separate car.
9811353 9813564 He says for you two<br />to go on ahead.
9813564 9816191 Hell, he can't do that.<br />It screws up all my arrangements.
9816275 9818777 - Well that's what he said.<br />- I can't go either, Sal.
9831415 9834168 Tell Mike it was only business.
9834251 9836753 I always liked him.
9836920 9839423 - He understands that.<br />- Excuse me, Sal.
9845846 9848348 Tom, can you get me off the hook?
9849433 9852144 - For old times' sake.<br />- Can't do it, Sally.
9898107 9900609 You have to answer<br />for Santino, Carlo.
9905489 9907324 Mike, you got it all wrong.
9907324 9909827 You fingered Sonny<br />for the Barzini people.
9911453 9914498 That little farce you played<br />with my sister.
9914623 9916625 Did you think that could fool<br />a Corleone?
9916625 9919795 Mike, I'm innocent.<br />I swear on the kids.
9919878 9922381 - Please, don't do this to me.<br />- Sit down.
9925509 9928011 Don't do this to me, please.
9936895 9939398 Barzini's dead.
9940566 9943068 So is Phillip Tattaglia...
9944278 9946780 Moe Greene...
9946780 9949283 Stracci...
9949867 9952369 Cuneo.
9952411 9955914 Today I settle all family business,<br />so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
9957791 9960294 Admit what you did.
9963422 9965924 Get him a drink.
9971555 9974016 Come on.
9974016 9976393 Don't be afraid, Carlo.
9976393 9978896 Come on. You think I'd make my sister<br />a widow?
9980564 9983066 I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.
9990199 9991533 Go ahead, drink.
9991533 9994036 Drink.
9997080 9999249 Now, Carlo, you're out<br />of the family business.
9999249 10002920 That's your punishment.<br />You're finished.
10003045 10005547 I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.
10011762 10015182 I want you to stay there.<br />Understand?
10015265 10017768 Only don't tell me<br />you're innocent...
10019353 10022314 because it insults my intelligence.
10022439 10024942 It makes me very angry.
10027820 10031073 Now, who approached you?
10031156 10033659 Tattaglia or Barzini?
10040791 10043293 It was Barzini.
10045754 10048257 Good.
10054888 10057558 There's a car waiting for you<br />outside to take you to the airport.
10058976 10061478 I'll call your wife,<br />tell her what flight you're on.
10067109 10069611 - Please, can I...<br />- Get out of my sight.
10095053 10097556 Hello, Carlo.
10154071 10156907 Will you stop crying?<br />What are you trying to tell me?
10156990 10159785 - I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.<br />- Mama, please!
10168210 10170212 Michael! Michael!
10170712 10173215 Where is he?
10175092 10180139 Michael, you lousy bastard!<br />You killed my husband!
10180264 10182850 You waited until Papa died<br />so nobody could stop you...
10182933 10184476 and then you killed him!
10184476 10187604 You blamed him for Sonny.<br />You always did. Everybody did.
10187729 10191358 But you never thought about me!<br />You never gave a damn about me!
10191442 10193944 Now what am I gonna do?
10197656 10200159 Why do you think<br />he kept Carlo at the mall?
10200242 10202786 All the time he knew<br />he was gonna kill him.
10202911 10205998 And you stood godfather<br />to our baby.
10206123 10208459 You lousy, coldhearted bastard.
10208459 10210961 Want to know how many men<br />he had killed with Carlo?
10210961 10212754 Read the papers!<br />Read the papers!
10212754 10215257 That's your husband!<br />That's your husband!
10228812 10231315 Take her upstairs.
10231356 10233859 - Get her a doctor.<br />- Oh, God!
10253921 10256423 She's hysterical.
10260344 10262846 Hysterical.
10263847 10266350 Michael, is it true?
10267810 10269853 Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
10269853 10273357 - Is it true?<br />- Don't ask me about my business.
10273482 10275984 - No.<br />- Enough!
10294378 10296880 All right.
10298674 10301176 This one time.
10304388 10306890 This one time, I'll let you<br />ask me about my affairs.
10313397 10315899 Is it true?
10319528 10322030 Is it?
10322322 10323824 No.
10337546 10339923 I guess we both need a drink, huh?
10339923 10342426 Come on.
10371997 10374500 Don Corleone.
