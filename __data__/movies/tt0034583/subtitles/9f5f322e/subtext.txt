76282 81078 <i>...many eyes in imprisoned Europe<br />turned hopefully or desperately...</i>
81328 83330 <i>...toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>
83581 86166 <i>Lisbon became<br />the great embarkation point.</i>
86417 89420 <i>But not everybody could get<br />to Lisbon directly.</i>
90087 93757 <i>And so a torturous, roundabout<br />refugee trail sprang up.</i>
94800 96885 <i>Paris to Marseilles.</i>
102391 105436 <i>Across the Mediterranean to</i> Oran.
112443 116739 <i>Then by train or auto or foot<br />across the rim of Africa...</i>

119867 124413 <i>Here, the fortunate ones,<br />through money or influence or luck...</i>
124997 128208 <i>...might obtain exit visas<br />and scurry to Lisbon.</i>

197277 198696 May we see your papers?
199029 200572 I don't have them on me.
200823 202991 In that case,<br />you'll have to come along.
203200 206787 It's possible that l...<br />Yes. Here they are.
209748 213252 These papers expired three weeks ago.<br />You'll have to come along.
215129 216422 OFFICER:<br />Halt!
216922 218465 (GUNSHOT)
241447 244032 WOMAN: What is going on?<br />MAN: I don't know, my dear.
244241 246660 Pardon me. Have you not heard?
246869 249580 We hear very little<br />and we understand even less.
249830 253584 Two German couriers were found<br />murdered in the unoccupied desert.
253876 256545 This is the customary<br />roundup of refugees, liberals...
256879 260007 ...and beautiful girls for Mr. Renault,<br />the prefect of police.
265012 268682 With these refugees, the scum<br />of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.
268891 271310 Some have been waiting<br />years for a visa.
271560 274813 I beg of you, monsieur.<br />Watch yourself. Be on guard.
275022 276982 This place is full of vultures.
277232 280027 Vultures everywhere. Everywhere.
280277 282905 - Thank you. Thank you very much.<br />- Not at all.
284948 286784 Amusing little fellow.
287034 288285 Waiter.
289578 291455 - How silly of me.<br />- What, dear?
291663 294291 I've left my wallet in the hotel.
294583 296502 (AIRPLANE APPROACHES)
310140 312100 Perhaps tomorrow<br />we'll be on the plane.
337334 339044 (OFFICERS IN GERMAN)
339294 341213 It is good to see you,<br />Maj. Strasser.
341421 342548 Thank you, thank you.
342840 345717 May I present Capt. Renault,<br />the police prefect.
347386 349221 Unoccupied France welcomes you.
349680 351348 Thank you, it's good to be here.
351682 354351 Maj. Strasser, my aide,<br />Lt. Casselle.
354643 358313 - Capt. Tonelli, the Italian service--<br />- That is kind of you.
358564 360774 (TONELLI IN ITALIAN)
361024 363318 (CASSELLE IN FRENCH)
364820 367614 You may find the climate<br />of Casablanca a trifle warm.
367865 371535 We Germans must get used to all<br />climates, from Russia to the Sahara.
371743 374705 - But you're not referring to the weather.<br />- What else?
374955 376957 What's been done about the murders?
377165 381044 My men are rounding up twice<br />the usual number of suspects.
381253 384256 - But we know who the murderer is.<br />- Good. Is he in custody?
384464 387384 Tonight he'll be at Rick's.<br />Everybody comes to Rick's.
387593 391346 I've already heard about this café.<br />Also about Mr. Rick himself.
400355 403108 (SAM SINGS "lT HAD TO BE YOU")
446818 449112 Waiting, waiting, waiting.
449363 451365 I'll never get out of here.
451615 453283 I'll die in Casablanca.
453575 456870 But can't you make it<br />just a little more, please?
457079 460207 Sorry, but diamonds are<br />a drag on the market.
460457 463001 There are diamonds everywhere.<br />Twenty-four hundred.
463210 464252 All right.
464670 468298 The trucks are waiting.<br />The men are waiting. Everything--
471301 473261 It's the fishing smack Santiago.
473470 477474 It leaves at one tomorrow night.<br />From the end of the marina.
477641 478642 Thank you.
478850 481436 And bring 15,000 francs in cash.
481645 483939 Remember, in cash.

490696 492322 Cheerio.
492698 495492 CARL: Open up, Abdul.<br />ABDUL: Yes, professor.
505043 506294 - Waiter?<br />- Yes, madame?
506503 509089 Will you ask Rick<br />if he'll have a drink with us?
509339 513385 Madame, he never drinks with customers.<br />Never. I've never seen it.
513593 515762 WOMAN:<br />What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?
516013 519808 Perhaps if you told him I ran<br />the second largest bank in Amsterdam.
520017 522728 The second largest?<br />That wouldn't impress Rick.
522978 526314 The leading banker in Amsterdam<br />is now the pastry chef here.
526523 529151 We have something to look forward to.
530444 532279 And his father is the bellboy.
532446 533530 Good!
535115 536867 Monsieur?
562476 563977 ABDUL:<br />Excuse me.
566438 568523 I'm sorry, sir.<br />This is a private room.
568732 572694 Of all the nerve! Who do you think--<br />I know there is gambling in there!
572903 574029 You dare not keep me out!
574279 575530 RICK:<br />What's the trouble?
575822 578700 I have been in every gambling room<br />from Honolulu to Berlin.
578950 582829 If you think I'll be kept out<br />of a saloon like this, you're mistaken.
582996 583997 Excuse me, please.
584164 585165 UGARTE:<br />Hello, Rick.
587834 589586 Your cash is good at the bar.
589961 591630 What? Do you know who I am?
591838 593924 I do. You're lucky<br />the bar is open to you.
594132 597260 This is outrageous!<br />I shall report it to the angriff!
600180 604309 Watching you now, one would think<br />you've been doing this all your life.
604518 607229 - What makes you think I haven't?<br />- Nothing.
607437 611608 - But when you first came, I thought--<br />- You thought what?
612067 614277 What right do I have to think?
619366 620617 May I?
621743 624162 Too bad about those two<br />German couriers.
624371 626998 They got lucky.<br />Yesterday, they were just clerks.
627207 629918 Today, they're the honoured dead.
630168 633380 You're a very cynical person,<br />forgive me for saying so.
633547 634589 I forgive you.
634756 636633 - Will you have a drink with me?<br />- No.
636842 640011 I forgot you never drink with--<br />I'll have another, please.
641012 642681 You despise me, don't you?
642931 645016 If I gave you any thought,<br />I would.
645267 646560 But Why?
647394 650105 You object to the kind<br />of business I do, huh?
650313 654985 But think of all those poor refugees<br />who must rot here if I didn't help them.
655193 659573 That's not so bad. Through ways of<br />my own, I provide them with exit visas.
659823 662242 For a price, Ugarte. For a price.
663535 666580 Think of the poor devils<br />who can't meet Renault's price.
666830 670000 I get it for them for half.<br />Is that so parasitic?
670333 673128 I don't mind a parasite.<br />I object to a cut-rate one.
674713 677465 After tonight, I'll be through<br />with the whole business.
677674 680218 And I'm leaving, finally,<br />this Casablanca.
680427 683680 Who'd you bribe for your visa?<br />Renault or yourself?
684139 687392 Myself. I found myself<br />much more reasonable.
687851 688894 Look, Rick.
689769 691271 You know what this is?
691688 694524 Something that even you<br />have never seen.
694774 697819 Letters of transit<br />signed by General de Gaulle.
698486 701072 Cannot be rescinded.<br />Not even questioned.
701281 702324 One moment.
702532 706703 Tonight, I'll be selling those for<br />more money than even I ever dreamed of.
706953 709039 And then, addio, Casablanca.
709539 713210 I have many a friend in Casablanca,<br />but just because you despise me...
713460 715212 ...you are the only one I trust.
715420 717172 Will you keep these for me?
717422 720050 - For how long?<br />- An hour. Perhaps a little longer.
720258 721635 I don't want them overnight.
721843 724888 Don't be afraid of that.<br />Please keep them for me.
725138 727224 Thank you.<br />I knew I could trust you.
727891 729768 Waiter,<br />I'll be expecting some people.
730018 733563 If anybody asks for me,<br />I'll be right here.
734022 735023 Rick...
735273 737943 ...I hope you're more<br />impressed with me now.
738860 741529 I'll share my good luck<br />with your roulette wheel.
741780 743323 Just a moment.
745367 750247 I heard a rumour those German couriers<br />were carrying letters of transit.
752415 754209 I've heard that rumour too.
754876 756962 - Poor devils.<br />- You're right, Ugarte.
757629 760674 I am a little more impressed with you.
769933 772686 (SINGING "KNOCK ON WOOD")
841421 842839 - Hello, Rick.<br />- Hello, Ferrari.
843089 844299 How's business at the Blue Parrot?
844549 847427 - Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.<br />- It's not for sale.
847677 850597 - You haven't heard my offer.<br />- It's not for sale at any price.
850847 854309 - What do you want for Sam?<br />- I don't buy or sell human beings.
854559 856686 That's Casablanca's leading commodity.
856936 860857 In refugees alone, we can make<br />a fortune together in the black market.
861066 863651 Suppose you run your business<br />and let me run mine.
864319 866654 Suppose we ask Sam.<br />Maybe he'd like to make a change.
866821 867864 Suppose we do.
868114 873328 When will you realize that in this world<br />isolationism is not a practical policy?
873578 875914 RICK: Ferrari wants you to work<br />for him at the Blue Parrot.
876247 877332 I like it fine here.
877582 881378 - He'll double what I pay you.<br />- But I ain't got time to spend money.
882003 883004 Sorry.
887342 890428 The boss's private stock.<br />Because, Yvonne, I love you.
890595 891596 Shut up.
891805 896434 All right. For you, I shut up.<br />Because, Yvonne, I love you.
898478 900188 Monsieur Rick.
900563 903733 Some Germans gave this check.<br />Is it all right'?
908571 909572 Where were you last night?
909823 912283 RICK: That's so long ago,<br />I don't remember.
912575 916246 - Will I see you tonight?<br />- I never make plans that far ahead.
917205 918456 Give me another.
918665 921292 RICK: She's had enough.<br />- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.
921501 923711 Yvonne, I love you,<br />but he pays me.
923962 926464 - I'm tired of having you--<br />- Sascha, call a cab.
926714 928716 - We'll get your coat.<br />- Take your hands off!
928925 931636 You're going home.<br />You've had too much to drink.
934180 935849 Hey, taxi!
937058 938726 Who do you think you are,<br />pushing me?
938935 940687 What a fool I was<br />to fall for you.
940937 943148 - Go with her. Be sure she gets home.<br />- Yes, boss.
943314 944315 Come right back.
944649 946067 Yes, boss.
957829 959456 - Hello, Rick.<br />- Hello, Louis.
959706 961749 How extravagant,<br />throwing away women like that.
962000 963835 Some day, they may be scarce.
964377 968006 I think I shall pay a call on Yvonne.<br />Maybe get her on the rebound.
968214 970592 When it comes to women,<br />you're a true democrat.
970800 972594 (CASSELLE IN FRENCH)
980685 984022 If he gets a word in,<br />it'll be a major Italian victory.
987984 989694 The plane to Lisbon.
994324 996075 You would like to be on it?
996284 997911 Why? What's in Lisbon?
998161 1000121 The clipper to America.
1000371 1003082 I've speculated on why<br />you don't return to America.
1003291 1007420 Did you abscond with the church funds?<br />Run off with a senator's wife?
1007629 1010340 I like to think you killed a man.<br />It's the romantic in me.
1010590 1012217 It's a combination of all three.
1012467 1014135 What brought you to Casablanca?
1014719 1017555 My health. I came<br />to Casablanca for the waters.
1017764 1021309 The waters? What waters?<br />We're in the desert.
1021518 1023353 I was misinformed.
1025897 1026981 EMIL:<br />Excuse me, Rick.
1027232 1030401 A gentleman inside<br />has won 20,000 francs...
1030735 1033029 ...and the cashier<br />would like some money.
1034322 1037283 <i>- I'll</i> get it from the safe.<br />EMIL: I'm so upset. You know--
1037492 1040078 Forget it, Emil.<br />Mistakes happen all the time.
1040286 1041996 EMIL:<br />I'm awfully sorry.
1047585 1050922 There'll be some excitement tonight.<br />An arrest in your café.
1051172 1053132 - Again?<br />- This is no ordinary arrest.
1053383 1054759 A murderer, no less.
1055385 1058972 If you're thinking of warning him,<br />don't. He cannot escape.
1059222 1063268 - I stick my neck out for nobody.<br />- A wise foreign policy.
1063518 1065520 (IN FRENCH)
1066604 1068940 We could've arrested him<br />at the Blue Parrot.
1069148 1071442 Out of my regard for you,<br />we're staging it here.
1071651 1073111 It will amuse your customers.
1073736 1075822 RICK:<br />Our entertainment's enough.
1076406 1081411 We'll have an important guest tonight.<br />Maj. Strasser, of the Third Reich.
1081619 1086040 We want him to see the arrest as a<br />demonstration of our efficiency.
1086291 1088293 RICK: I see.<br />What's Strasser doing here?
1088543 1092297 He didn't come here to witness<br />a demonstration of your efficiency.
1092547 1093715 - Perhaps not.<br />- Here you are.
1093923 1096009 - It won't happen again.<br />RICK: That's all right.
1096217 1099095 Louis, there's something on your mind.<br />Why don't you spill it?
1099304 1100722 How observant you are.
1101306 1103641 I wanted to give you<br />a word of advice.
1103891 1105059 Yeah?
1105310 1107562 - Have a brandy?<br />- Thank you.
1108730 1112942 There are exit visas sold in this café,<br />but we know you've never sold one.
1113276 1115278 That's why we let you remain open.
1115486 1117530 I thought it was because<br />I let you win at roulette.
1117780 1119365 That is another reason.
1119616 1122285 There's a man arrived here<br />on his way to America.
1122493 1125371 He'll offer a fortune to anyone<br />who'll get him a visa.
1125622 1128124 - What's his name?<br />- Victor Laszlo.
1128499 1129751 Victor Laszlo?
1129959 1132295 That's the first time<br />I've seen you impressed.
1132545 1134672 He's succeeded<br />in impressing half the world.
1134881 1137258 It's my duty to see<br />he doesn't impress the other half.
1137592 1141638 Rick, Laszlo must never reach America.<br />He stays in Casablanca.
1141888 1143806 RICK: It'll be interesting<br />to see how he manages.
1144015 1146184 - Manages what?<br />RICK: His escape.
1146392 1148186 - But I just told you--<br />- Stop it.
1148436 1151939 He escaped the concentration camp.<br />Nazis have chased him through Europe.
1152190 1153608 LOUIS:<br />This is the end of the chase.
1153858 1157737 - Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.<br />- Is that a serious offer?
1158363 1160448 I just paid 20.<br />I'd like to get it back.
1160657 1163409 Make it ten.<br />I'm only a poor, corrupt official.
1164285 1165453 - Okay.<br />- Done.
1165703 1169707 No matter how clever he is, he still<br />needs a visa. Or, I should say, two.
1170124 1172126 - Why two?<br />- He is traveling with a lady.
1172377 1175004 - He'll take one.<br />- I think not. I've seen her.
1175630 1178174 If he did not leave her<br />in Marseilles or in Oran...
1178383 1180510 ...he won't leave her in Casablanca.
1180760 1182845 Maybe he's not quite<br />as romantic as you.
1183096 1186265 It doesn't matter.<br />There is no exit visa for him.
1186808 1190603 What ever gave you the impression<br />that I might help Laszlo escape?
1190812 1193898 Because I suspect<br />that under that cynical shell...
1194399 1195900 ...you're at heart<br />a sentimentalist.
1196609 1199570 Laugh if you will.<br />I'm familiar with your record.
1199821 1201989 Let me point out just two items.
1202490 1205910 In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.
1206411 1210248 In 1936, you fought in Spain<br />on the loyalist side.
1210581 1212792 And got well paid on both occasions.
1213000 1215253 The winning side<br />would've paid much better.
1215878 1217004 Maybe.
1217755 1219924 It seems you're determined<br />to keep Laszlo here.
1220133 1221968 I have my orders.
1222677 1224554 RICK:<br />I see. Gestapo spank.
1224804 1227557 You overestimate<br />the influence of the Gestapo.
1227807 1231144 I don't interfere with them<br />and they don't interfere with me.
1231394 1233354 In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.
1233646 1235773 - I am--<br />- Maj. Strasser is here, sir.
1236023 1238359 - You were saying?<br />- Excuse me.
1248119 1251330 Carl, see that the major gets<br />a good table, close to the ladies.
1251581 1256210 I've already given him the best, knowing<br />he is German and would take it anyway.
1258337 1261549 Take him quietly.<br />Two guards at every door.
1265970 1268514 - Everything is ready, sir.<br />- Go ahead.
1273895 1276063 - Good evening, gentlemen.<br />- Good evening, captain.
1276314 1278483 HEINZ: Won't you join us?<br />- Thank you.
1279525 1281277 LOUIS:<br />It's a pleasure to have you here.
1281527 1283112 Champagne and a tin of caviar.
1283362 1286866 May I recommend <i>Veuve Clicquot, </i> '26?<br />A good French wine.
1287116 1288701 WAITER:<br />Very well, sir.
1289368 1292497 - A very interesting club.<br />- Especially so tonight.
1292747 1296042 You'll see the arrest of the man<br />who murdered your couriers.
1296292 1297960 I expected no less, captain.
1298169 1299796 Monsieur Ugarte.
1301672 1302673 Yes?
1302840 1306010 - Will you please come with us?<br />- Certainly.
1306636 1308346 May I first cash my chips?
1309263 1311599 (EMIL IN FRENCH)
1315394 1318231 UGARTE: Very lucky.<br />Two thousand, please.
1319232 1320650 CASHIER:<br />Two thousand.
1325696 1326864 Thank you.
1340086 1342046 Rick! Rick, help me!
1342338 1346592 - Don't be a fool. You can't get away.<br />- Rick, hide me! You must help me!
1346843 1347927 Do something!
1348177 1349428 Rick!
1354183 1355309 Excellent, captain.
1355601 1358020 When they come to get me,<br />I hope you'll be more help.
1358271 1360481 I stick my neck out for nobody.
1360731 1364485 I'm sorry there was a disturbance,<br />folks, but it's all over now.
1364735 1368447 Sit down and have a good time.<br />Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.
1374328 1375580 LOUIS:<br />Rick?
1376038 1379458 This is Maj. Heinrich Strasser<br />of the Third Reich.
1379667 1381502 - How do you do?<br />- How do you do?
1381711 1383838 You know Herr Heinz<br />of the Third Reich.
1384088 1386090 STRASSER:<br />Please join us, Mr. Rick.
1390219 1391637 We are very honoured tonight.
1391846 1395766 Maj. Strasser is one reason<br />the Third Reich enjoys its reputation.
1395975 1398978 You say "Third Reich" as though<br />you expect there to be others.
1399186 1402148 Personally, major,<br />I will take what comes.
1403107 1405151 Do you mind if I ask<br />a few questions?
1405401 1407737 - Unofficially, of course.<br />- Make it official if you like.
1407987 1410615 - What is your nationality?<br />- I'm a drunkard.
1412158 1414285 That makes Rick<br />a citizen of the world.
1414702 1417121 I was born in New York City,<br />if that'll help you.
1417705 1420750 I understand you came here from Paris<br />during the occupation.
1421042 1422835 There seems to be no secret about that.
1423085 1427131 Are you one of those who can't imagine<br />Germans in their beloved Paris?
1427673 1429550 It's not particularly<br />my beloved Paris.
1429800 1431552 Can you imagine us in London?
1432803 1434263 When you get there, ask me.
1434847 1437224 - Diplomatist!<br />- How about New York?
1437475 1442355 There are sections of New York that<br />I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
1442980 1445650 - Who will win the war?<br />- I haven't the slightest idea.
1445900 1448778 Rick is neutral about everything.<br />And that takes in...
1449028 1450529 ...the field of women too.
1450780 1452865 You weren't always<br />so carefully neutral.
1453074 1455743 We have a complete dossier on you.
1457036 1461624 "Richard Blaine, American. Age, 37.<br />Cannot return to his country."
1461874 1464543 The reason is vague.<br />We know what you did in Paris...
1464794 1468631 ...and why you left Paris.<br />Don't worry, we won't broadcast it.
1468839 1470216 Are my eyes really brown?
1470466 1472218 You will forgive my curiosity.
1472468 1475596 The point is, an enemy of the Reich<br />has come to Casablanca...
1475846 1479058 ...and we are checking up on anyone<br />who can be of any help.
1479350 1483312 My interest in whether Laszlo<br />stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
1484188 1487233 In this case, you have<br />no sympathy for the fox?
1487483 1490861 Not particularly. I understand<br />the hound's point of view too.
1491237 1495825 Laszlo published the foulest lies in the<br />Prague newspapers till we marched in.
1496033 1500413 And even after that, he continued<br />to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
1500663 1503374 Of course, one must admit<br />he has great courage.
1503749 1506460 He's clever. Three times<br />he slipped through our fingers.
1506711 1510715 In Paris, he continued his activities.<br />We intend not to let it happen again.
1510965 1514343 Excuse me. Your business is<br />politics, mine is running a saloon.
1514593 1516429 Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
1517096 1519974 You see, major? You have<br />nothing to worry about Rick.
1520141 1521142 Perhaps.
1525229 1526272 HOST:<br />Yes, monsieur?
1526522 1531027 - I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.<br />- Yes, monsieur. Right this way.
1557678 1559346 <i>Two Cointreaux, please.</i>
1561432 1563893 I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
1564143 1567188 Victor, I feel somehow<br />we shouldn't stay here.
1567438 1570274 If we'd walk out so soon<br />it'd only call attention to us.
1570524 1572443 Perhaps he's in some<br />other part of the café.
1574487 1578282 Excuse me, but you look like a couple<br />who are on their way to America.
1578574 1582828 You'll find a market for this ring.<br />I must sell it at a great sacrifice.
1583079 1585498 - Thank you, but I don't--<br />- Perhaps for the lady.
1585748 1587083 BERGER:<br />The ring is quite unique.
1589335 1591462 Yes, I'm very interested.
1591921 1592922 Good.
1593547 1594548 Your name?
1594799 1597009 Berger, Norwegian.<br />At your service.
1597426 1598427 Victor...
1599011 1600805 I'll meet you at the bar later.
1601055 1603474 We don't want the ring,<br />but thank you for showing it to us.
1603724 1606811 BERGER: That is your decision?<br />LAZLO: It is.
1609688 1611774 - Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?<br />- Yes.
1612024 1614026 Captain Renault, prefect of police.
1614235 1615277 What do you want?
1615528 1618572 To welcome you to Casablanca<br />and to wish you a pleasant stay.
1618781 1621534 It isn't often we have<br />so distinguished a visitor.
1621742 1624120 Thank you.<br />I hope you'll forgive me, captain.
1624370 1627873 The present French administration<br />hasn't always been so cordial.
1628124 1630000 May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
1631710 1634547 I was told you were the most<br />beautiful woman to visit Casablanca.
1634797 1636590 That was a gross understatement.
1637049 1638092 You're very kind.
1638342 1640970 - Won't you join us?<br />- If you'll permit me.
1641178 1644932 Emil, please. A bottle of your<br />best champagne. Put it on my bill.
1645391 1650479 It's a game we play. They put it on the<br />bill, I tear it up. Very convenient.
1651438 1654191 Captain, the boy<br />who's playing the piano...
1654900 1656277 Somewhere I've seen him.
1656527 1657903 LOUIS: Sam?<br />ILSA: Yes.
1658112 1660114 He came from Paris with Rick.
1660322 1661407 Rick? Who's he?
1661657 1665119 - You are in Rick's. Rick is...<br />-ls what?
1665369 1668581 Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man--<br />If I were a woman...
1668831 1671500 ...and I weren't around,<br />I'd be in love with Rick.
1671709 1675796 But what a fool I am talking to<br />a beautiful woman about another man.
1676630 1677631 Excuse me.
1678048 1679300 LOUIS:<br />Major.
1681177 1684263 Mademoiselle and monsieur,<br />may I present Maj. Strasser?
1684513 1685681 How do you do?
1685848 1687808 This is a pleasure<br />I've looked forward to.
1688017 1690561 I'm sure you'll excuse me<br />if I'm not gracious.
1690769 1692855 But you see,<br />I am a Czechoslovakian.
1693063 1697651 You were a Czechoslovakian. Now<br />you're a subject of the German Reich.
1698444 1701697 I've never accepted that privilege.<br />And I'm now on French soil.
1701906 1705618 I'd like to discuss some matters arising<br />from your presence on French soil.
1705868 1707536 This is hardly the time or the place.
1707745 1712166 Then we'll state another time and place.<br />Tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office.
1712416 1713500 With mademoiselle.
1715211 1718214 Capt. Renault,<br />I am under your authority.
1718422 1720424 Is it your order<br />we come to your office?
1720674 1724553 Let us say it is my request.<br />That is a much more pleasant word.
1724803 1726639 - Very well.<br />- Mademoiselle.
1726847 1728432 Mademoiselle.
1730559 1733354 A very clever tactical retreat, major.
1733687 1737608 - This time they really mean to stop me.<br />- Victor, I'm afraid for you.
1738067 1740819 We've been in difficult<br />places before, haven't we?
1745157 1747159 (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
1774061 1775938 I must find out what Berger knows.
1776146 1779400 - Be careful.<br />- I will. Don't worry.
1797209 1799920 Mr. Berger, the ring.<br />Could I see it again?
1800504 1802089 Champagne cocktail, please.
1802923 1805467 I recognize you<br />from the news photographs.
1805718 1809013 In a concentration camp,<br />one is apt to lose a little weight.
1809263 1811932 I read five times<br />that you were killed in five places.
1812182 1814935 As you see, it was true<br />every single time.
1815144 1816520 Thank heaven I found you.
1816729 1820482 I'm looking for a man named Ugarte.<br />He's supposed to help me.
1821108 1823235 Ugarte cannot even help himself.
1823485 1825738 He's under arrest for murder.
1825988 1827823 He was arrested here tonight.
1828365 1829491 I see.
1830159 1833871 But we, who are still free, will do<br />all we can. We are organized.
1834121 1836415 Underground, like everywhere else.
1836623 1839460 Tomorrow night, there is a meeting<br />at the Café du Roi.
1839793 1841462 If you'll come--
1854975 1857394 Will you ask the piano player<br />to come over here?
1857603 1859271 WAITER:<br />Very well, mademoiselle.
1861732 1865069 - How's the jewelry business?<br />- Not so good. Check, please.
1865277 1869531 Too bad you weren't here earlier.<br />We had quite a bit of excitement, right?
1869782 1870949 Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
1871200 1874286 - My bill.<br />- No. Two champagnes. Please.
1874536 1875788 SASCHA:<br />Yes, sir.
1879500 1881794 ILSA: Hello, Sam.<br />- Hello, Miss Ilsa.
1882002 1884505 I never expected to see you again.
1885255 1886840 It's been a long time.
1887049 1890552 Yes, ma'am.<br />A lot of water under the bridge.
1891845 1894848 - Some of the old songs, Sam.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
1904817 1905859 Where is Rick?
1906568 1908946 I don't know.<br />I ain't seen him all night.
1910030 1911031 When will he be back?
1911281 1913409 Not tonight no more.<br />He ain't coming--
1913617 1915077 He went home.
1916745 1918372 Does he always leave so early?
1918580 1922209 Oh, he never--<br />He's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot.
1922418 1924586 Goes up there all the time.
1926213 1928882 You used to be<br />a much better liar, Sam.
1929842 1933011 Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.<br />You're bad luck to him.
1935973 1938725 Play it once, Sam.<br />For old time's sake.
1938976 1941520 SAM:<br />I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
1942104 1943689 Play it, Sam.
1944648 1946608 Play "As Time Goes By."
1946817 1949987 I can't remember it.<br />I'm a little rusty on it.
1950904 1952948 I'll hum it for you.
1953532 1955826 (HUMS)
1960998 1963709 (PLAYS "AS TIME GOES BY")
1964585 1965836 Sing it, Sam.
1968464 1970924 (SINGS "AS TIME GOES BY")
2012174 2014843 Sam, I thought I told you<br />never to play--
2025479 2028482 You were asking about Rick<br />and here he is. May I present--
2028732 2031026 - Hello, Ilsa.<br />- Hello, Rick.
2031276 2034696 You've already met Rick?<br />Then perhaps you also--
2034947 2036281 ILSA:<br />This is Mr. Laszlo.
2036532 2037783 LASZLO: How do you do?<br />RICK: How do you do?
2038283 2040327 One hears a great deal<br />about Rick in Casablanca.
2040619 2042454 And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
2042746 2044498 - Join us for a drink?<br />- Rick never--
2044665 2045666 Thanks, I will.
2045916 2049586 Well! A precedent<br />is being broken. Emil?
2050671 2052839 A very interesting café.<br />I congratulate you.
2053090 2054675 RICK: I congratulate you.<br />LASZLO: What for?
2054841 2055842 Your work.
2056260 2057719 Thank you. I try.
2058679 2060556 We all try. You succeed.
2060764 2063183 She was asking about you earlier...
2063433 2066228 ...in a way that made me<br />extremely jealous.
2066436 2067980 I wasn't sure you were the same.
2068814 2071650 ILSA: The last time we met--<br />- Was La Belle Aurore.
2073235 2075153 How nice. You remembered.
2075362 2078073 That was the day<br />the Germans marched into Paris.
2078365 2080450 Not an easy day to forget.
2081326 2084955 I remember every detail.<br />The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
2086456 2089001 Yes. I put that dress away.
2089251 2091503 When the Germans march out,<br />I'll wear it again.
2091753 2095924 You're becoming quite human.<br />I suppose we have to thank you for that.
2096258 2099511 Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one<br />to say it, but it's late.
2099761 2102306 So it is. We have a curfew<br />here in Casablanca.
2102514 2105976 It wouldn't do for the chief of police<br />to be drinking after hours.
2106810 2109104 LASZLO:<br />I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
2109438 2110981 WAITER: Your check, sir.<br />RICK: My party.
2111231 2114735 Another precedent gone. This has been<br />a very interesting evening.
2114985 2118822 I'll call you a cab.<br />Gasoline rationing, time of night...
2119239 2120782 LASZLO: We'll come again.<br />RICK: Any time.
2121033 2123035 - Say good night to Sam.<br />- I will.
2124077 2128123 There's still nobody in the world<br />who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
2128582 2131001 He hasn't played it in a long time.
2132502 2135130 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
2144222 2146725 A very puzzling fellow.<br />What sort is he?
2146975 2150103 I really can't say,<br />though I saw him quite often in Paris.
2150354 2153023 - Tomorrow at 10 at the prefect office.<br />- We'll be there.
2153273 2154274 Good night.
2193730 2194940 SAM:<br />Boss?
2198860 2200779 - Boss?<br />- Yeah?
2201279 2204282 SAM: Ain't you going to bed?<br />RICK: Not right now.
2204533 2207494 Ain't you planning on going to bed<br />in the near future?
2207744 2209830 - You ever going to bed?<br />- No!
2210664 2212416 I ain't sleepy either.
2212624 2213792 Then have a drink.
2214042 2215836 - Not me.<br />- Well, don't have a drink.
2216086 2217504 Let's get out of here.
2217713 2220215 No, sir.<br />I'm waiting for a lady.
2220424 2223009 Let's go. Ain't nothing<br />but trouble for you here.
2223260 2225095 I know she's coming back.
2225345 2227097 We'll drive all night.
2227347 2229975 We'll get drunk<br />and stay away till she's gone.
2230225 2232060 Shut up and go home, will you?
2232310 2235188 No, sir. I'm staying right here.
2240360 2242612 They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.
2242863 2243989 (SAM PLAYS PIANO)
2244239 2246867 That's the way it goes.<br />One in, one out.
2247993 2250245 - Sam.<br />- Yes, boss.
2250495 2254708 If it's December, 1941 in Casablanca,<br />what time is it in New York?
2255250 2256334 What--?
2256710 2258128 My watch stopped.
2259004 2261173 I bet they're asleep in New York.
2261423 2264134 I bet they're asleep all over America.
2270849 2274394 Of all the gin joints in all the towns<br />in all the world...
2275270 2277355 ...she walks into mine.

2287491 2290202 - Stop it. You know what I wanna hear.<br />- I don't.
2290410 2292829 You played it for her,<br />you can play it for me.
2293079 2296208 - I don't remember--<br />- If she can stand it, I can.
2296458 2297751 Play it!

2437974 2439684 A franc for your thoughts.

2448568 2449569 Tell me.
2450403 2451988 Well, I was wondering...
2452405 2453448 Yes?
2453823 2458119 ...why I'm so lucky, why I should<br />find you waiting for me to come along?
2459287 2461498 Why there is no other man in my life?
2463833 2466127 That's easy. There was.
2468129 2469673 He's dead.
2470590 2472509 I'm sorry for asking.

2694230 2695523 It's strange.

2698526 2700069 I know little about you.
2700320 2702947 Except that you had<br />your teeth straightened.
2703948 2706743 Be serious. You're in danger.<br />You must leave Paris.
2706993 2708203 No, we must leave.

2724010 2726095 All right, at a quarter to five.
2726346 2728139 Why don't we marry<br />in Marseilles?
2732852 2734562 That's too far ahead to plan.
2734771 2737190 I guess it is a little too far ahead.

2831784 2834162 But this note came<br />just after you left.

2851304 2852930 Do you hear me?
2853389 2856851 Come on, Mr. Richard.<br />Let's get out of here. Come on.
2908236 2910238 Rick, I have to talk to you.
2911322 2914784 I saved my first drink<br />to have with you. Here.
2915410 2918788 - No, Rick. Not tonight.<br />- Especially tonight.
2919497 2922959 Why did you have to come to Casablanca?<br />There are other places.
2923292 2926045 I wouldn't have come<br />if I'd known that you were here.
2926254 2927964 Believe me, it's true.<br />I didn't know.
2928214 2931676 It's funny how your voice hasn't<br />changed. I can still hear it.
2931884 2934262 "Richard, clear,<br />I'll go with you anyplace.
2934679 2938099 - We'll get on a train and never stop."<br />- Don't, Rick.
2938724 2941102 I can understand how you feel.
2941561 2943729 You understand how I feel?
2944480 2946232 How long was it we had, honey?
2947108 2949068 - I didn't count the days.<br />- Well, I did.
2949735 2951154 Every one of them.
2951821 2954240 Mostly, I remember the last one.
2954699 2958202 The "wow" finish. A guy standing<br />on a platform in the rain...
2958411 2962999 ...with a comical look on his face<br />from his insides having been kicked out.
2964584 2966711 Can I tell you a story, Rick?
2966919 2968629 Has it got a "wow" finish?
2969547 2971591 I don't know the finish yet.
2971799 2974969 Go on, tell it. Maybe one will<br />come to you as you go along.
2977763 2981559 It's about a girl who'd just come<br />to Paris from her home in Oslo.
2981767 2983478 At the house of some friends...
2983686 2986397 ...she met a man about whom<br />she'd heard her whole life.
2986647 2989066 A very great and courageous man.
2990276 2995281 He opened up for her a beautiful world<br />full of knowledge, thoughts and ideals.
2995490 2999076 Everything she knew or ever became<br />was because of him.
2999785 3003247 She looked up to him<br />and worshiped him...
3003498 3005917 ...with a feeling she supposed was love.
3006417 3008503 Yes, that's very pretty.
3008711 3011964 I heard a story once.<br />I've heard a lot of stories in my time.
3012173 3015134 They went along with<br />the sound of a tinny piano...
3015343 3017553 ...playing in the parlour downstairs.
3018387 3023059 "Mister, I met a man once when<br />I was a kid," they'd always begin.
3025728 3029106 I guess neither one of our stories<br />is very funny.
3029398 3030399 Tell me...
3031651 3033653 ...who was it you left me for?
3033861 3036447 Was it Laszlo, or were there<br />others in between...
3037448 3039534 ...or aren't you the kind that tells?
3064850 3068312 STRASSER: I suspect Ugarte left<br />the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.
3068563 3071065 I suggest you search<br />the café immediately.
3071274 3074235 If Rick has them, he's too smart<br />to let you find them there.
3074443 3076320 You give him credit<br />for too much cleverness.
3076529 3079365 My impression was that he's just<br />another blundering American.
3079574 3081701 We mustn't underestimate<br />American blundering.
3081909 3085204 I was with them when they<br />blundered into Berlin in 1918.
3085871 3088583 As to Laszlo, we want him watched<br />24 hours a day.
3088791 3092628 LOUIS: It may interest you to know that<br />at this moment he's on his way here.
3098342 3100344 OFFICER:<br />There's nothing we can do.
3101554 3104015 I'm delighted to see you both.<br />Did you rest well?
3104181 3105182 I slept well.
3105391 3108978 That's strange. Nobody's supposed<br />to sleep well in Casablanca.
3109312 3112732 - May we proceed with the business?<br />- With pleasure. Sit down.
3115318 3118654 We won't mince words. You're<br />an escaped prisoner of the Reich.
3118863 3121532 So far you've been<br />fortunate enough in eluding us.
3121782 3123326 You have reached Casablanca.
3123534 3126245 It is my duty to see<br />that you stay here.
3126454 3128456 Whether or not you'll<br />succeed is problematic.
3128664 3131417 Not at all. Renault's signature<br />is necessary on every visa.
3131626 3134253 Is it possible Herr Laszlo<br />will receive a visa?
3134462 3136756 I'm afraid not.<br />My regrets, monsieur.
3136964 3139467 Well, perhaps<br />I shall like it in Casablanca.
3139675 3141218 STRASSER:<br />And mademoiselle?
3141427 3145056 - You needn't be concerned about me.<br />- Is that all you wish to tell us?
3145306 3148142 Don't be in a hurry.<br />You have all the time in the world.
3148351 3150895 You may be in<br />Casablanca indefinitely.
3151354 3154273 Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.<br />On one condition.
3154440 3155441 And that is?
3155775 3159070 You know the leader of the underground<br />movement in Paris, in Prague...
3159320 3162948 ...in Brussels, in Amsterdam,<br />in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens...
3163199 3165701 - Even Berlin.<br />STRASSER: Yes, even in Berlin.
3165993 3170414 If you'll furnish me with their names<br />and whereabouts, you'll have your visa.
3170748 3173876 LOUIS: And the honour of having<br />served the Third Reich.
3174126 3176587 I was in a German<br />concentration camp for a year.
3176796 3178297 That's honour enough for a lifetime.
3178839 3180216 You'll give us the names?
3181842 3184303 If I didn't give them to you<br />in a concentration camp...
3184553 3187515 ...where you had more persuasive<br />methods at your disposal...
3187765 3190309 ...I certainly won't<br />give them to you now.
3190810 3193104 What if you track them down<br />and kill them?
3193354 3194897 What if you murdered us all?
3195147 3199318 From every corner of Europe, hundreds,<br />thousands would rise to take our places.
3199568 3201821 Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
3202238 3205574 You have a reputation for eloquence,<br />which I can now understand.
3205783 3207243 But you're mistaken.
3207493 3210079 You said enemies of the Reich<br />could be replaced.
3210287 3211789 There is one exception.
3211997 3214417 No one could take your place<br />if anything unfortunate...
3214667 3217586 ...should occur to you<br />while you're trying to escape.
3218087 3220172 You won't dare<br />to interfere with me here.
3220423 3222091 This is still unoccupied France.
3222508 3225136 Any violation of neutrality<br />would reflect on the captain.
3225386 3228097 -Insofar as it is in my power...<br />- Thank you.
3228347 3232643 By the way, last night you evinced<br />an interest in Senor Ugarte.
3233102 3234103 Yes.
3234353 3235896 You have a message for him.
3237231 3239483 Nothing important.<br />May I speak to him now?
3240234 3242987 You would find the conversation<br />a trifle one-sided.
3243237 3245030 Senor Ugarte is dead.
3251787 3253080 I'm making the report.
3253289 3256459 We haven't quite decided whether<br />he committed suicide...
3256709 3258419 ...or died trying to escape.
3260212 3262923 - Are you finished with us?<br />STRASSER: For the time being.
3263132 3264341 Good day.
3269013 3271557 Their next step<br />will be to the black market.
3271807 3272892 OFFICER:<br />Excuse me, captain.
3273100 3275603 Another visa<br />problem has come up.
3276520 3278105 Show her in.
3288199 3291035 Sorry, we wouldn't be able<br />to handle the police.
3291285 3293788 - This is a job for Senor Ferrari.<br />- Ferrari?
3294038 3296373 It can be most helpful<br />to know Ferrari.
3296624 3299210 He has a monopoly<br />on the black market here.
3299460 3301378 You'll find him at the Blue Parrot.
3302046 3303547 MAN: Thanks.
3315684 3317186 FERRARI:<br />Don't be too downhearted.
3317436 3320231 Perhaps you can come to terms<br />with Capt. Renault.
3320981 3323192 RICK: Hello, Ferrari.<br />FERRARI: Good morning, Rick.
3323442 3325861 I see the bus is in.<br />I'll take my shipment.
3326070 3328781 - No hurry. Have a drink.<br />- I never drink in the morning.
3328989 3332368 Every time you send my shipment,<br />it's always a bit short.
3332576 3334620 Carrying charges, my boy.
3334870 3336163 Here, sit down.
3336372 3338916 There's something<br />I want to talk over with you.
3341126 3342795 FERRARI:<br />The news about Ugarte upsets me.
3343045 3346006 You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel<br />any sorrier than I do.
3346173 3347174 Of course not.
3347383 3351470 What upsets me is that he's dead and<br />no one knows where those letters are.
3351762 3352805 Practically no one.
3353055 3355516 FERRARI: If I had those letters,<br />I could make a fortune.
3355766 3357810 So could I,<br />and I'm a poor businessman.
3358018 3360062 I've a proposition<br />for whoever has them.
3360271 3361730 I'll handle the transaction.
3361981 3364859 Get rid of the letters, take<br />all the risk, for a small fee.
3365109 3366569 And the carrying charges?
3366819 3369655 Naturally, there will be<br />a few incidental expenses.
3370281 3372575 That's my proposition<br />for whoever has the letters.
3372783 3374285 RICK:<br />I'll tell him when he comes in.
3374535 3377288 I'll put my cards out.<br />I think you know where they are.
3377496 3381250 You're in good company. Renault<br />and Strasser probably think so too.
3386422 3389466 I came over here to give them<br />a chance to ransack my place.
3389675 3392970 Don't be a fool. Take me into<br />your confidence. You need a partner.
3393178 3395431 Excuse me,<br />I'll be getting back.
3398684 3402605 LASZLO: Good morning.<br />- Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
3406984 3409737 DEALER: You won't find a treasure<br />like this in all Morocco.
3409945 3411238 Only 700 francs.
3411447 3413240 You're being cheated.
3413449 3414742 It doesn't matter, thank you.
3414950 3417912 For friends of Rick's<br />we have a small discount.
3418120 3420789 Did I say 700 francs?<br />You can have it for 200.
3421040 3424209 I'm sorry I was in no condition<br />to receive you last night.
3424418 3425419 It doesn't matter.
3425586 3428172 Special friends of Rick's<br />get a special discount.
3428380 3429506 One hundred francs.
3429757 3432885 Your story had me confused,<br />or maybe it was the bourbon.
3433135 3434428 I have some tablecloths--
3434678 3437431 ILSA: I'm really not interested.<br />DEALER: Please, one minute.
3437890 3441435 Did you come back to tell me<br />why you ran out on me at the station?
3441602 3442603 Yes.
3442811 3445230 You can tell me now.<br />I'm reasonably sober.
3445439 3446815 I don't think I Will.
3447024 3451195 Why not'? I got stuck with the<br />railway ticket. I'm entitled to know.
3451612 3453864 Last night I saw<br />what has happened to you.
3454406 3457701 The Rick I knew in Paris,<br />I could tell him. He'd understand.
3457910 3460537 But the one who looked at me<br />with such hatred...
3462081 3464917 I'll be leaving soon and<br />we'll never see each other again.
3466168 3469755 We knew very little about each other<br />when we were in love in Paris.
3470381 3474760 If we leave it that way, maybe we'll<br />remember those days, and not Casablanca.
3475678 3476971 Not last night.
3477471 3480641 Did you run out on me because<br />you knew what it'd be like?
3480891 3483769 Hiding from the police,<br />running away all the time?
3484019 3485646 Believe that if you want to.
3485854 3488565 I'm not running away anymore.<br />I'm settled now.
3488816 3490651 Above a saloon, it's true, but...
3490859 3493946 Walk up a flight.<br />I'll be expecting you.
3496240 3498951 All the same,<br />someday you'll lie to Laszlo.
3499159 3500619 You'll be there.
3502496 3503956 No, Rick.
3504873 3507710 No. You see,<br />Victor Laszlo is my husband.
3508210 3511463 And was, even when<br />I knew you in Paris.
3516385 3520639 I was just telling Laszlo that,<br />unfortunately, I'm not able to help him.
3521140 3522933 The word has gone around.
3523183 3527521 As leader of all illegal activities,<br />I'm an influential and respected man.
3528605 3531316 But it'd not be worth my life<br />to do anything for Laszlo.
3531567 3533402 You, however, are a different matter.
3533652 3538157 Senor Ferrari thinks it might just be<br />possible to get an exit visa for you.
3538657 3541702 - You mean for me to go on alone?<br />FERRARI: And only alone.
3541910 3544997 I'll stay and keep trying.<br />I'm sure in a little while--
3545205 3546915 Might as well be frank.
3547124 3550753 It'd take a miracle to get you out.<br />The Germans have outlawed miracles.
3551128 3553047 We're only interested in two visas.
3553255 3555632 - Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.<br />- No, Victor.
3556091 3558052 You two will want to discuss this.
3558260 3560679 Excuse me.<br />I'll be at the bar.
3564099 3565893 No, I won't let you stay here.
3566101 3569396 You must get to America.<br />Somehow I'll get out and join you.
3569688 3571482 If the situation were different...
3571690 3574234 ...if I had to stay and there was<br />only one visa...
3574443 3575611 ...would you take it?
3576904 3577905 Yes, I would.
3579114 3580908 Yes, I see.
3581617 3583577 When I had trouble<br />getting out of Lille...
3583786 3585287 ...why didn't you leave me?
3585537 3589833 When I was sick in Marseilles<br />for two weeks and you were in danger...
3590042 3591627 ...why didn't you leave me?
3592961 3595422 I meant to.<br />Something always held me up.
3598008 3599384 I love you very much.
3600594 3603013 Your secret will be safe with me.
3603889 3605849 Ferrari is waiting for our answer.
3606183 3608227 FERRARI:<br />Not more than 50 francs.
3613065 3614817 We've decided, Senor Ferrari.
3615067 3618654 For the present we're looking<br />for two visas. Thank you very much.
3618862 3620572 Good luck, but be careful.
3620823 3623575 - You know you're being shadowed?<br />- It becomes instinct.
3624076 3626954 I observe that you, in one respect,<br />are very fortunate.
3627287 3629832 I'll make one suggestion.<br />Why, I do not know.
3630082 3632084 It cannot possibly profit me.
3632292 3634586 Have you heard<br />about the letters of transit?
3635420 3636421 Yes, something.
3636672 3639508 They were not found on Ugarte<br />when they arrested him.
3640050 3642010 - You know where they are?<br />- Not for sure.
3642261 3645305 But my guess is Ugarte left<br />those letters with Rick.
3647307 3650310 He's a difficult man.<br />One never knows what he'll do, or why.
3650602 3652271 But it is worth a chance.
3652813 3655357 Thank you very much.<br />Good day.
3655858 3657609 Bye. Thank you for your coffee.
3657818 3659570 I shall miss that when we leave.
3659820 3662489 It was gracious of you<br />to share it with me.
3662739 3664950 - Monsieur.<br />- Good day.
3672457 3674084 (SAM PLAYS PIANO)
3674418 3676420 - Here's to you, sir.<br />MAN: Good luck.
3676712 3678505 - I'd better be going.<br />MAN: Check, please.
3678714 3682467 I have to warn you. This is<br />a dangerous place, full of vultures.
3682718 3685429 - Vultures everywhere. Thanks.<br />- Goodbye.
3685679 3688724 It has been a pleasure to meet you.<br />I'm sorry.
3706033 3709161 You are getting to be<br />your best customer.
3710704 3713123 LOUIS: Well, drinking!<br />I'm very pleased with you.
3713332 3715125 You're beginning<br />to live like a Frenchman.
3715375 3717544 That's some going-over<br />your men gave my place.
3717753 3719838 We barely got cleaned up<br />in time to open.
3720088 3722049 I told Strasser<br />he wouldn't find the letters.
3722257 3724384 But I told my men to be<br />especially destructive.
3724593 3727512 You know how that impresses Germans.
3728138 3730474 Rick, have you got<br />those letters of transit?
3730724 3733185 Louis, are you pro-Vichy<br />or Free French?
3733435 3737522 Serves me right for asking a direct<br />question. The subject is closed.
3737814 3739816 It looks like you're a little late.
3747866 3749576 So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
3749785 3753789 Who knows? In her own way, she may<br />constitute an entire second front.
3754248 3757542 It's time for me to flatter Strasser.<br />I'll see you later.
3758210 3759628 Sascha!
3759795 3760796 GERMAN SOLDIER:<br />French '75.
3761046 3762589 Put up the whole row of those.
3762798 3764883 Starting here and ending here.
3765133 3767386 We will begin with two.
3767636 3769638 (IN FRENCH)
3775560 3777646 What did you say?<br />Would you repeat it?
3777896 3779481 What I said is<br />not your business.
3779690 3781149 I'll make it my business.
3787447 3791118 I don't like disturbances in my place.<br />Lay off politics or get out.
3795497 3797040 You see, captain?
3797249 3799293 The situation is not under control.
3799501 3801753 LOUIS: We're trying to cooperate<br />with your government.
3801962 3803922 We can't regulate<br />our people's feelings.
3804172 3806591 Are you certain which side you're on?
3806967 3808927 I have no conviction.
3809136 3810387 I blow With the Wind...
3810637 3812889 ...and the prevailing wind<br />is from Vichy.
3813140 3814933 And if it should change?
3815309 3817311 Surely the Reich doesn't admit<br />that possibility?
3817519 3819521 We're concerned about more<br />than Casablanca.
3819730 3823483 Every French province in Africa<br />is honeycombed with traitors...
3823692 3826486 ...waiting for their chance,<br />waiting perhaps for a leader.
3826695 3828822 A leader? Like Laszlo?
3829031 3830449 I have been thinking.
3830657 3833744 It is too dangerous if you<br />let him go or let him stay.
3833952 3834995 I see what you mean.
3835662 3837539 (IN GERMAN)
3840959 3842461 Thank you, Carl.
3843045 3844755 Thank you, Carl.
3845464 3847299 Sit down. Have a brandy with us.
3847549 3850010 To celebrate our leaving<br />for America tomorrow.
3850218 3851386 Thank you very much.
3851595 3854389 I thought you'd ask me,<br />so I brought the good brandy...
3854639 3856141 ...and the dress glass.
3856391 3858143 At last the day's came!
3858393 3861480 We are speaking nothing<br />but English now.
3861730 3864483 So we should feel at home<br />when we get to America.
3864691 3866485 A very nice idea.
3866777 3868236 To America.
3868695 3869696 To America.
3870405 3872074 To America.
3874826 3876828 (IN GERMAN)
3877245 3878955 What watch?
3879664 3882501 - Ten watch.<br />- Such much?
3884169 3886338 You'll get along<br />beautifully in America.
3887506 3889216 LOUIS:<br />How is lady luck treating you?
3889466 3891051 Oh, too bad.
3891676 3893553 You'll find him over there.
3899893 3901311 - Monsieur Rick?<br />- Yes?
3901561 3904439 - Could I speak to you?<br />- How'd you get in? You're underage.
3904648 3907275 - I came with Capt. Renault.<br />- I should've known.
3907484 3908777 My husband is with me too.
3908985 3911571 He is? Renault's getting<br />broad-minded. Sit down.
3911738 3912739 Have a drink?
3912989 3915242 Of course not.<br />You mind if I do?
3916368 3919663 Monsieur Rick, what kind of a man<br />is Capt. Renault?
3919913 3921540 Like any other man,<br />only more so.
3921790 3924960 No, I mean...<br />Is he trustworthy? ls his word--
3925168 3927129 Who told you to ask me that?
3927379 3929005 He did. Capt. Renault.
3929214 3931425 I thought so.<br />Where's your husband?
3931967 3935929 At the roulette table, trying<br />to win enough for our exit visas.
3936179 3937889 Of course he's losing.
3938098 3939808 How long have you been married?
3940016 3941059 Eight weeks.
3942018 3944020 We come from Bulgaria.
3944438 3946440 Things are very bad there.
3946690 3949067 The devil has the people<br />by the throat.
3949317 3951903 So Jan and I, we...
3952112 3954698 We don't want our children<br />to grow up there.
3954906 3957200 - So you decided to go to America.<br />- Yes.
3957409 3959661 But we have not much money...
3960120 3962581 ...and traveling is<br />so expensive and difficult.
3962831 3965083 It was more than<br />we thought to get here.
3965542 3967419 Then Capt. Renault sees us.
3967627 3969504 He's so kind.<br />He wants to help us.
3969671 3970672 Yes, I'll bet.
3971089 3973425 He tells me he can give us<br />an exit visa.
3973633 3975844 But we have no money.
3976052 3977637 - Does he know that?<br />- Yes.
3977888 3979848 And he's still willing<br />to give you a visa?
3980307 3981391 You want to know...
3981600 3983268 Will he keep his word?
3984478 3985479 He always has.
3989149 3990525 Monsieur...
3990775 3992402 You are a man.
3992986 3995489 If someone loved you very much...
3995697 3999701 ...so that your happiness was the only<br />thing she wanted in the world...
4000619 4003455 ...and she did a bad thing<br />to make certain of it...
4004080 4005332 ...could you forgive her?
4005540 4006958 Nobody ever loved me that much.
4007167 4011338 And he never knew, and the girl kept<br />this bad thing locked in her heart...
4011546 4012964 ...that would be all right?
4013173 4015592 - You want my advice?<br />- Yes, please.
4015842 4016968 Go back to Bulgaria.
4017427 4021515 But if you knew what it means to us<br />to leave Europe, to get to America.
4022849 4024935 But if Jan should find out...
4025143 4026811 He is such a boy.
4027145 4030273 In many ways,<br />I am so much older than he is.
4030482 4032901 Yes, everybody in Casablanca<br />has problems.
4033151 4035570 Yours may work out.<br />You'll excuse me.
4045038 4046122 Good evening.
4046331 4047374 See? Here we are again.
4047541 4049876 I'll take that as a compliment to Sam.
4050085 4053296 I suppose he means to you<br />Paris of happier days.
4054005 4056967 He does. Could we have<br />a table close to him?
4057217 4059719 And as far away<br />from Strasser as possible.
4059928 4062514 The geography may be<br />difficult to arrange.
4062764 4064391 Paul, table 30.
4064641 4066393 WAITER:<br />Right this way, if you please.
4066601 4070313 I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."<br />I believe that's your favourite.
4070564 4071940 Thank you.
4077237 4079406 (PLAYS "AS TIME GOES BY")
4081408 4082909 Two cognac, please.
4089583 4091626 (IN FRENCH)
4107267 4109436 Do you wish to place<br />another bet, sir?
4110186 4111730 No, I guess not.
4111938 4113898 Have you tried <i>22</i> tonight?
4115483 4116860 I said "22."
4133376 4134836 Leave it there.
4149517 4151936 Cash it in and don't come back.
4154105 4156524 Are you sure this place is honest?
4156733 4160278 Honest? As honest as the day is long.
4163448 4164783 How are we doing tonight?
4164991 4167994 A couple of thousand less<br />than I thought there would be.
4171456 4172832 Monsieur Rick...
4178546 4180715 He's just a lucky guy.
4182842 4185720 Monsieur Rick, may I get you<br />a cup of coffee?
4185929 4187389 No thanks, Carl.
4191518 4194646 - Capt. Renault, may I--<br />- Not here, please.
4194979 4196981 Come to my office.<br />We'll be businesslike.
4197232 4200110 - We'll be there at six.<br /><i>- I'll</i> be there at ten.
4200318 4201986 I'm very happy for both of you.
4202195 4204447 Still, it's very strange<br />that you won.
4204656 4206741 Well, maybe not so strange.
4206950 4209452 <i>- I'll</i> see you in the morning.<br />- Thank you so much.
4217502 4220130 Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.
4221172 4223174 Go away, you crazy Russian.
4233601 4234894 As I suspected.
4235103 4237272 - You're a rank sentimentalist.<br />- Why?
4237480 4239524 Why interfere<br />with my little romances?
4239733 4241609 Put it down as a gesture to love.
4241818 4243319 I forgive you this time.
4243570 4246406 But I'll be in tomorrow<br />with a breathtaking blonde.
4246614 4249325 And it'll make me<br />very happy if she loses.
4252954 4254831 I wonder if I could talk to you?
4254998 4255999 Go ahead.
4256207 4257876 Isn't there some other place?
4258126 4260628 It's rather confidential,<br />what I have to say.
4262547 4264382 - In my office.<br />- Right.
4265800 4268553 You know it's very important<br />I get out of Casablanca.
4268803 4271639 I'm privileged to be one<br />of the leaders of a great movement.
4271848 4273558 You know what I've been doing.
4273808 4277854 You know what it means to the work,<br />to the lives of thousands of people...
4278062 4280023 ...that I continue my work.
4280231 4281608 I'm not interested in politics.
4281858 4285653 The problems of the world are not<br />in my department. I'm a saloonkeeper.
4286112 4289532 My friends in the underground tell me<br />that you've quite a record.
4289741 4291242 You ran guns to Ethiopia.
4291451 4294287 - You fought the fascists in Spain.<br />- What of it?
4294537 4297665 Isn't it strange you always<br />seem to fight with the underdog?
4297957 4299793 I found that an expensive hobby.
4300001 4302670 But then I never was<br />much of a businessman.
4302879 4305799 Are you enough of a businessman<br />to appreciate 100,000 francs?
4306007 4307425 I appreciate it,<br />but I don't accept it.
4307675 4308843 I'll raise it to 200,000.
4309219 4313681 Make it a million francs or three.<br />My answer would still be the same.
4313890 4316059 There's a reason<br />you won't let me have them.
4316309 4317435 There is.
4317894 4320021 I suggest that you ask your wife.
4320271 4322941 - I beg your pardon?<br />- I said, ask your wife.
4323316 4325652 - My wife?<br />- Yes.
4325902 4327862 (GERMANS SING "DAS LIED<br />DER DEUTSCHEN") (German Anthem)
4366192 4368152 Play "La Marseillaise."<br />Play it!

4429422 4431132 (PATRONS CHEER)
4444312 4448191 See? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe<br />can inspire this demonstration...
4448441 4450777 ...what more will his<br />presence here bring on?
4450985 4453154 I advise that this place<br />be shut up at once.
4453363 4456115 - Everybody's having a good time.<br />- Much too good a time.
4456366 4457533 The place is to be closed.
4457742 4460578 - But I've no excuse to close it.<br />- Find one.
4465750 4467418 LOUIS:<br />Everyone is to leave immediately.
4467627 4469837 This café is closed<br />until further notice.
4470046 4472048 Clear the room at once!
4475134 4476260 On what grounds?
4476511 4479931 I'm shocked to find that<br />gambling is going on in here.
4480390 4482100 - Your winnings, sir.<br />- Thank you.
4482350 4483601 Everybody out at once!
4488106 4492110 After this disturbance, it's not safe<br />for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
4492360 4494904 This morning it wasn't safe<br />for him to leave.
4495154 4498157 That's also true,<br />except to return to occupied France.
4498408 4501202 - Occupied France?<br />- Under safe conduct from me.
4501411 4502453 Of what value is that?
4502704 4505540 Remember what German guarantees<br />have been worth in the past.
4505790 4509002 - There are only two other alternatives.<br />- What are they?
4509210 4513464 French authorities may find a reason to<br />put him in the concentration camp here.
4513673 4514716 ILSA:<br />The other alternative?
4514966 4519679 Perhaps you have already observed<br />that in Casablanca, human life is cheap.
4519971 4521681 Good night, mademoiselle.
4531983 4535028 - What happened with Rick?<br />- We'll discuss it later.
4558468 4560887 Our faithful friend is still there.
4561095 4563598 Please don't go<br />to the underground meeting.
4563765 4564766 I must.
4564974 4568227 It isn't often that a man gets to<br />display heroics before his wife.
4568436 4571939 Don't joke. After Strasser's<br />warning tonight, I'm frightened.
4572190 4573858 I'm frightened too.
4574108 4576569 Shall I remain here<br />in a hotel room, hiding?
4576819 4578488 Or carry on the best I can?
4579072 4581532 Whatever I'd say,<br />you would carry on.
4582450 4585328 Why don't you tell me about Rick?<br />What did you find out?
4585536 4587747 - Apparently he has the letters.<br />- Yes?
4587955 4589415 But he won't sell them.
4589624 4592126 I'd think if sentiment won't<br />persuade him, money would.
4593586 4595129 Did he give you any reason?
4595379 4597423 He suggested I ask you.
4597632 4598674 Ask me?
4598925 4601469 Yes. He said, "Ask your wife."
4601969 4604055 I don't know why he said that.
4616109 4619278 Our friend outside will think<br />we've retired by now.
4620404 4622615 I'll be going in a few minutes.
4624367 4626786 -Ilsa, I--<br />- Yes?
4628204 4630665 When I was in the concentration camp...
4630915 4633042 ...were you lonely in Paris?
4634961 4637213 Yes, Victor. I was.
4637922 4640341 I know how it is to be lonely.
4642009 4644303 Is there anything you wish to tell me?
4646347 4648683 No, Victor. There isn't.
4653020 4654272 I love you very much.
4656983 4658234 Yes.
4658901 4660570 Yes, I know.
4661654 4664157 Whatever I do,<br />will you believe that I--
4664407 4666826 You don't even have to say it.
4667076 4668703 I'll believe.
4670997 4672456 Good night, dear.
4674292 4675668 Good night.
4682550 4683551 Victor?
4684051 4685386 Yes, dear?
4690683 4692143 Be careful.
4693603 4695396 Of course I'll be careful.
4738648 4741651 Well, you are in pretty good shape,<br />Herr Rick.
4741859 4743986 How long can I afford to stay closed?
4744195 4745655 Two weeks, maybe three.
4745905 4747990 Maybe I won't have to.<br />A bribe worked before.
4748241 4750701 In the meantime,<br />everybody stays on salary.
4750952 4752036 Thank you.
4752286 4754038 Sascha will be happy to hear it.
4754288 4755915 I owe him money.
4756165 4759001 - You finish locking up, will you?<br />- I will.
4759210 4762296 - Then I'm going to the meeting--<br />- Don't tell me.
4762505 4763756 I won't.
4764882 4766050 Good night.
4767176 4768719 Good night, Mr. Rick.
4785403 4788614 - How did you get in?<br />- The stairs from the street.
4788823 4792201 I told you you'd come around,<br />but this is ahead of schedule.
4792451 4793661 Won't you sit down'?
4793869 4797415 - Richard, I had to see you.<br />-"Richard" again. We're back in Paris.
4797623 4801252 Your visit isn't connected by any chance<br />with the letters of transit?
4801460 4804005 As long as I have them,<br />I'll never be lonely.
4804213 4806799 Ask any price,<br />but give me those letters.
4807008 4809593 I went through that with<br />your husband. It's no deal.
4810386 4811804 I know how you feel about me...
4812013 4814724 ...but please put that aside<br />for something important.
4814932 4817184 Do I have to hear again<br />how great your husband is...
4817435 4819478 ...what an important cause<br />he's fighting for?
4819687 4821188 It was your cause too.
4821439 4823858 In your way you were fighting<br />for the same thing.
4824150 4827028 I'm not fighting for anything anymore,<br />except myself.
4827236 4829322 I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
4834452 4835536 Richard...
4835745 4839332 We loved each other once.<br />If those days meant anything at all--
4839582 4842209 I wouldn't bring up Paris.<br />It's poor salesmanship.
4842418 4845963 Listen. If you knew what really<br />happened, if you knew the truth--
4846172 4848090 I wouldn't believe you no matter what.
4848299 4850760 You'd say anything now<br />to get what you want.
4855598 4857516 You want to feel sorry for yourself?
4858642 4861854 With so much at stake, all you can<br />think of is your own feeling.
4862063 4865399 One woman has hurt you, and you<br />take revenge on the rest of world.
4865649 4868694 You're a coward and a weakling!
4872198 4873324 No.
4873574 4875159 Richard, I'm sorry.
4876243 4878954 I'm sorry, but you--<br />You are our last hope.
4879163 4882041 If you don't help us,<br />Victor will die in Casablanca.
4882208 4883209 What of it'?
4883417 4886045 I'm gonna die in Casablanca.<br />It's a good spot for it.
4893052 4894345 Now, if you'll--
4897181 4898516 All right.
4898724 4900684 I tried to reason with you.
4900893 4902978 I tried everything.<br />I want those letters.
4903437 4904438 Get them for me.
4904647 4906524 I don't have to.<br />I got them right here.
4908401 4910111 Put them on the table.
4911904 4912905 No.
4913906 4916075 For the last time,<br />put them on the table.
4917576 4921372 If Laszlo and the cause mean so much<br />to you, you won't stop at anything.
4922873 4925418 All right,<br />I'll make it easier for you.
4927336 4930256 Go ahead and shoot.<br />You'll be doing me a favour.
4935970 4937638 Richard...
4937888 4940015 I tried to stay away.
4940683 4943144 I thought I would never see you again.
4944603 4946689 That you were out of my life.
4967209 4969628 The day you left Paris...
4970921 4973174 ...if you knew what I went through.
4974467 4977261 If you knew how much I loved you.
4978262 4980681 How much I still love you.
4994820 4995821 And then?
4997948 5002286 It wasn't long after we were married<br />that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
5002536 5006040 They needed him in Prague.<br />But the Gestapo were waiting for him.
5006248 5007583 Just <i>2</i> lines in the paper:
5007833 5010628 "Victor Laszlo apprehended.<br />Sent to concentration camp."
5012046 5014423 I was frantic.<br />For months I tried to get word.
5014632 5015925 Then it came.
5016133 5018636 He was dead.<br />Shot, trying to escape.
5019553 5022598 I was lonely.<br />I had nothing, not even hope.
5023474 5024642 Then I met you.
5025226 5028229 Why weren't you honest?<br />Why keep your marriage a secret?
5028437 5031774 It wasn't my secret, Richard.<br />Victor wanted it that way.
5032024 5034318 Not even our closest friends<br />knew about it.
5035069 5037613 He was protecting me.<br />I knew about his work.
5037863 5041200 If the Gestapo found out I was his wife,<br />it'd be dangerous for me...
5041450 5042910 ...and for those working with us.
5043702 5045871 When did you first find out<br />he was alive?
5047164 5049500 Just before you and I<br />were to leave Paris.
5049708 5052253 A friend came and told me<br />that Victor was alive.
5052503 5055798 They hid him in a freight car<br />in the outskirts of Paris.
5056006 5058050 He was sick. He needed me.
5059510 5061637 I wanted to tell you,<br />but I didn't dare.
5061887 5066600 I knew you wouldn't have left and the<br />Gestapo would have caught you, so l...
5069478 5071564 Well, you know the rest.
5073983 5076610 It's still a story without an ending.
5077152 5078153 What about now?
5079613 5080698 Now?
5081490 5083075 I don't know.
5083784 5086412 I know I'll never have<br />the strength to leave you again.
5087663 5088706 And Laszlo?
5089081 5092293 You'll help him now, won't you?<br />You'll see that he gets out.
5092543 5095796 Then he'll have his work.<br />All that he's been living for.
5096046 5097881 All except one.
5099008 5100593 He won't have you.
5102511 5104763 I can't fight it anymore.
5106181 5109143 I ran away from you once.<br />I can't do it again.
5111729 5114523 I don't know what's right any longer.
5114732 5117276 You have to think for both of us.
5117776 5119236 For all of us.
5122781 5123866 All right.
5124116 5125492 I Will.
5129538 5131457 Here's looking at you, kid.
5133125 5136045 I wish I didn't love you so much.
5148557 5150684 CARL: I think we lost them.<br />LASZLO: Yes.
5150893 5152436 LASZLO:<br />They caught some of the others.
5152686 5154021 CARL:<br />Come inside.
5158359 5162738 Come, Mr. Laszlo.<br />I will help you immediately.
5166992 5169203 CARL:<br />I'll give you some water.
5182633 5184426 RICK:<br />Carl, what happened?
5184927 5188639 The police break up our meeting.<br />We escaped in the last moment.
5188889 5191141 - Come up here a minute.<br />- Yes, I come.
5191350 5194687 RICK: Turn out the light at the rear.<br />It may attract police.
5194895 5197439 - Sascha always puts it out.<br />- Tonight he forgot.
5198148 5200275 Yes, I come. I will do it.
5208075 5209785 Take Miss Lund home.
5210035 5211328 Yes, sir.
5222464 5225342 Just a little cut.<br />We had to get through a window.
5225551 5227553 This might come in handy.
5227761 5228971 Thank you.
5229221 5230347 RICK:<br />Had a close one?
5230556 5231807 Yes, rather.
5233767 5236520 Don't you sometimes wonder<br />if it's worth all this?
5236729 5238856 I mean, what you're fighting for.
5239523 5241775 We might as well question<br />why we breathe.
5241984 5243277 We stop breathing, we'll die.
5243485 5245529 We stop fighting our enemies,<br />the world will die.
5245738 5248490 What of it'?<br />Then it'll be out of its misery.
5248699 5250743 You know how you sound?
5251034 5255164 Like a man who's convincing himself<br />of something he doesn't believe.
5255372 5256498 Each of us has a destiny.
5257374 5259168 For good or for evil.
5259334 5260335 I get the point.
5260627 5262129 I wonder if you do.
5262337 5265507 I wonder if you know you're trying<br />to escape from yourself.
5265716 5267092 You'll never succeed.
5267468 5270345 You seem to know all about my destiny.
5271388 5274141 I know a good deal more<br />about you than you suspect.
5274349 5276560 I know that you're<br />in love with a woman.
5276769 5278729 It's perhaps a strange circumstance...
5278937 5281023 ...that we're in love<br />with the same woman.
5281565 5283942 The first evening<br />I came into this café...
5284151 5287070 ...I knew there was something<br />between you and Ilsa.
5287279 5289156 Since no one is to blame...
5289406 5291408 ...I demand no explanation.
5291617 5294870 I ask only one thing.<br />You won't give me the letters...
5295037 5296079 ...all right.
5296789 5298791 But I want my wife to be safe.
5298999 5300292 I ask you as a favour...
5300542 5303504 ...to use the letters<br />to take her away from Casablanca.
5303670 5304671 You love her that much?
5305130 5308300 Apparently, you think of me only<br />as the leader of a cause.
5309426 5311553 I'm also a human being.
5311887 5313222 Yes, I love her that much.
5321063 5322356 - Mr. Laszlo?<br />- Yes?
5322564 5324942 Come with us.<br />We have a warrant for your arrest.
5325108 5326109 On what charge?
5326318 5328487 The captain will discuss<br />that with you later.
5328737 5331406 It seems that destiny<br />has taken a hand.
5343377 5347464 You haven't any proof.<br />This isn't Germany or occupied France.
5347673 5351510 You can fine him and give him 30 days.<br />You might as well let him go.
5351760 5354847 I advise you not to be interested<br />in what happens to Laszlo.
5355097 5356640 If you help him to escape--
5356849 5358976 Why do you think I'd stick<br />my neck out for him?
5359184 5361728 Because, one, you bet<br />10,000 francs he'd escape.
5361979 5365107 Two, you've got the letters.<br />Don't bother to deny it.
5365315 5368151 You might do it because<br />you don't like Strasser's looks.
5368360 5370028 I don't like them either.
5370612 5371822 RICK:<br />They're all excellent reasons.
5372030 5373991 Don't count too much on my friendship.
5374199 5375659 In this matter, I'm powerless.
5375868 5377619 Besides, I might lose 10,000 francs.
5377870 5382541 You're not very subtle,<br />but you are effective. I get the point.
5382749 5384209 Yes, I have the letters.
5384459 5386420 I intend using them myself.
5386670 5390090 I'm leaving Casablanca<br />on tonight's plane. The last plane.
5390340 5393385 I'm taking a friend with me.<br />One you'll appreciate.
5393594 5395512 - What friend?<br />-llsa Lund.
5395762 5399266 That ought to put your mind to rest<br />about my helping Laszlo escape.
5399516 5401476 The last man I want to see in America.
5401727 5403353 You didn't come here to say this.
5403562 5404813 You have the letters.
5405022 5408233 Fill in your name and hers<br />and leave anytime you please.
5408442 5411069 Why do you still care<br />what happens to Laszlo?
5411278 5415407 I'm not. But I am interested<br />in what happens to Ilsa and me.
5415657 5419161 We have a legal right to go,<br />but people have been held here...
5419369 5421371 ...in spite of their legal rights.
5421580 5423248 Why do you think<br />we want to hold you?
5423498 5424833 Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.
5425083 5427961 She probably knows things<br />Strasser would like to know.
5428170 5429630 I'll make a deal with you.
5429838 5433675 Instead of this petty charge,<br />you could get something really big...
5433884 5436553 ...that would chuck him<br />in a camp for years.
5436762 5438180 That'd be a feather in your cap.
5438388 5441600 It certainly would. Germany--<br />Vichy would be grateful.
5441850 5442851 RICK:<br />Then release him.
5443060 5445687 Be at my place a half-hour<br />before the plane leaves.
5445896 5448398 Laszlo will come there<br />to pick up the letters.
5448649 5451193 That'll give you the grounds<br />to make the arrest.
5451526 5453779 You get him, and we get away.
5453987 5456865 To the Germans, that last<br />will be just a minor annoyance.
5457074 5459868 There's still something<br />I don't understand.
5460202 5462829 Miss Lund,<br />she is very beautiful, yes...
5463038 5465290 ...but you were never interested<br />in any woman.
5465499 5466959 She isn't just any woman.
5467167 5468460 I see.
5468669 5470796 How do I know you'll keep<br />your bargain?
5471004 5473757 I'll make the arrangements<br />with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
5473966 5478720 I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one<br />here who has even less scruples than I.
5479096 5480430 Thanks.
5480931 5481932 Go ahead, Ricky.
5482182 5486645 Call off your watchdogs when you let<br />him go. I don't want them around today.
5486895 5489189 I'm taking no chances,<br />not even with you.
5496738 5499116 FERRARI: Should We draw it up,<br />or is a handshake good enough?
5499366 5502828 Certainly not good enough. But since<br />I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
5503036 5506498 Ah, to get out of Casablanca and<br />go to America! You're a lucky man.
5506707 5510210 My agreement with Sam is<br />that he gets 25% of the profits.
5510419 5512087 That still goes.
5512295 5514881 I happen to know he gets 10%.<br />But he's worth 25.
5515090 5518051 Abdul, Carl and Sascha stay<br />with the place or I don't sell.
5518301 5521013 Of course. Rick's<br />wouldn't be Rick's without them.
5521179 5522180 So long.
5522639 5525225 Remember you owe Rick's<br />100 carton of cigarettes.
5525475 5527894 FERRARI: I shall remember<br />to pay it to myself.
5563013 5565891 RICK: You're late.<br />- I was informed as he left the hotel.
5566099 5567267 So I'm on time.
5567476 5570479 - I said to tie up your watchdogs.<br />- He won't be followed.
5570687 5572773 This place won't<br />be the same without you.
5573023 5576234 I've already spoken to Ferrari.<br />You'll still win at roulette.
5576485 5577569 LOUIS:<br />ls everything ready?
5577819 5579154 I have the letters here.
5579488 5581573 When we searched the place,<br />where were they?
5581823 5583158 Sam's piano.
5583867 5585786 Serves me right<br />for not being musical.
5586036 5587037 Here they are.
5587537 5589414 You better wait in my office.
5598924 5601593 Victor thinks I'm going with him.<br />Haven't you told him?
5601802 5604012 - Not yet.<br />- But it's all right, isn't it?
5604221 5605680 Everything's quite all right.
5605931 5609976 We'll tell him at the airport. The less<br />time to think, the easier. Trust me.
5612979 5614272 Yes, I will.
5619152 5623448 - I don't know how to thank you.<br />- Save it. We still have a lot to do.
5625200 5628620 LASZLO: I brought the money.<br />RICK: Keep it, you'll need.
5628829 5630705 LASZLO: We made a deal.<br />RICK: Never mind that.
5630914 5632457 You won't have<br />trouble in Lisbon?
5632916 5634084 No. It's all arranged.
5634292 5636378 Good. The letters are<br />made out in blank.
5636628 5639047 All you have to do is<br />fill in the signatures.
5639548 5640799 LOUIS:<br />Victor Laszlo...
5641341 5642968 ...you're under arrest.
5646847 5650684 For accessory to the murder of the<br />couriers from whom these were stolen.
5651434 5654729 You're surprised about Ricky?<br />The explanation is simple.
5654938 5657691 Love, it seems, has triumphed<br />over virtue. Thank--
5658567 5662946 Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's gonna<br />be arrested. Not for a while yet.
5663155 5666199 - Have you taken leave of your senses?<br />- I have. Sit down.
5666408 5669452 I don't want to shoot you,<br />but I will if you take one more step.
5670203 5673039 Under the circumstances,<br />I will sit down.
5675208 5676209 Keep your hands down.
5676418 5679087 I wonder if you realize<br />what this means?
5679337 5681423 I do. We'll discuss that later.
5681631 5683175 Call off the watchdogs, you said.
5683383 5685635 Call the airport.<br />You tell them.
5685886 5688513 Remember, this gun is pointed<br />right at your heart.
5688763 5691391 That is my least vulnerable spot.
5698523 5700442 Hello? Is that the airport?
5701818 5703320 Capt. Renault speaking.
5703570 5706198 There'll be two<br />letters of transit for Lisbon.
5706406 5708366 There's to be no trouble about them.
5708575 5709576 Good.
5710160 5712412 Hello? Hello?
5716374 5717834 My Car, quickly.
5719502 5720587 This is Strasser.
5720795 5723006 Have police meet me<br />at the airport at once.
5723256 5724966 At once, do you hear?
5731806 5733767 OFFICER:<br />Hello, radio tower?
5734017 5737020 Lisbon plane taking off in ten minutes,<br />east runway.
5737354 5739814 Visibility one and one-half miles.
5740065 5741274 Light ground fog.
5741524 5743860 Depth of fog approximately 500.
5744110 5746446 Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.
5759209 5761836 Have him go with Laszlo<br />to take care of his luggage.
5762045 5764089 Certainly, Rick, anything you say.
5764339 5767300 Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage<br />and put it on the plane.
5767717 5768718 OFFICER:<br />This way, please.
5770637 5773598 RICK: Fill in the names.<br />That'll make it even more official.
5773848 5776059 You think of everything, don't you?
5776309 5778603 The names are<br />Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
5778853 5780897 But why my name?
5781106 5782565 You're getting on that plane.
5782774 5783942 But what about you?
5784150 5786236 I'm staying here<br />till the plane gets away.
5786444 5788196 What's happened to you?<br />Last night--
5788446 5790657 Last night we said<br />a great many things.
5790865 5792575 You said I was to do the thinking<br />for us.
5792826 5795078 I've done a lot.<br />It all adds up to one thing:
5795328 5798206 You're getting on that plane with Victor<br />where you belong.
5798415 5800375 Now, you've got to listen to me.
5800583 5803211 Do you know what you'd have<br />to look forward to here?
5803461 5807173 We'd both wind up in a<br />concentration camp. Isn't that true?
5807424 5809175 Maj. Strasser would insist.
5809384 5812846 - You're saying this to make me go.<br />- I'm saying it because it's true.
5813054 5815181 Inside we both know<br />you belong with Victor.
5815390 5817726 You're part of his work,<br />the thing that keeps him going.
5817934 5820812 If that plane leaves and you're not<br />with him, you'll regret it.
5821062 5824441 Maybe not today, not tomorrow,<br />but soon. For the rest of your life.
5825483 5826526 But what about us?
5827652 5829070 We'll always have Paris.
5829321 5832324 We didn't have. We'd lost it<br />until you came to Casablanca.
5832532 5834659 We got it back last night.
5835452 5838997 - When I said I would never leave you.<br />- And you never will.
5839622 5841166 I've got a job to do too.
5841374 5844878 Where I go, you can't follow.<br />What I do, you can't be any part of.
5845587 5847172 I'm no good at being noble.
5847422 5850508 But it doesn't take much to see<br />that the problems of three people...
5850717 5853595 ...don't amount to a hill of beans<br />in this crazy world.
5853803 5855930 Someday you'll understand that.
5861019 5863104 Here's looking at you, kid.
5878453 5880830 - Everything is in order.<br />RICK: All except one thing.
5881039 5883166 There's something you should know.
5883375 5885126 I don't ask you<br />to explain anything.
5885335 5887962 It may make a difference<br />to you later on.
5888254 5890423 You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
5890757 5893301 She was at my place<br />last night when you were.
5893551 5896179 She came there for the letters.<br />Isn't that true?
5897347 5898348 Yes.
5899099 5901017 She tried everything.<br />Nothing worked.
5901309 5904979 She did her best to convince me<br />that she was still in love with me.
5905188 5907649 But that was all over long ago.
5907857 5910819 For your sake, she pretended it wasn't.<br />I let her pretend.
5911903 5912946 I understand.
5913279 5915448 - Here it is.<br />- Thanks.
5916199 5917826 I appreciate it.
5918952 5920620 Welcome back to the fight.
5920829 5923206 This time I know our side will win.
5937137 5938179 Are you ready?
5941182 5942350 Yes, I'm ready.
5945770 5946813 Goodbye, Rick.
5947856 5949357 God bless you.
5951109 5953611 Better hurry.<br />You'll miss that plane.
5971713 5973465 I was right.<br />You are a sentimentalist.
5973715 5975258 RICK:<br />Stay where you are.
5975508 5978303 - I don't know what you mean.<br />- What you did for Laszlo.
5978511 5980680 And that fairy tale<br />to send Ilsa away with him.
5980889 5984809 I know a little about women. She went,<br />but she knew you were lying.
5985768 5987562 Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
5987770 5990273 This isn't going to be<br />pleasant for either of us.
5990523 5992108 Especially for you.
5992358 5993651 I'll have to arrest you.
5993943 5995737 As soon as the plane goes.
6003036 6005079 What was the meaning<br />of that phone call?
6005288 6007081 Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
6009709 6011711 Why do you stand here?<br />Why not stop him?
6012003 6013922 Ask Monsieur Rick.
6016424 6017634 Get away from that phone.
6017842 6019093 Do not interfere.
6019302 6021429 I was willing to shoot Renault.<br />I'll shoot you.
6025016 6026059 Put that phone down.
6026267 6028186 - Get me the radio tower.<br />- Put it down!
6043201 6044702 LOUIS:<br />Maj. Strasser has been shot.
6049707 6051960 Round up the usual suspects.
6075984 6079487 You're not only a sentimentalist,<br />but you've become a patriot.
6079696 6081781 Maybe. It seemed like<br />a good time to start.
6081990 6084075 I think perhaps you're right.
6109183 6112854 It might be good for you to disappear<br />from Casablanca for a while.
6113062 6115315 There's a Free French garrison<br />at Brazzaville.
6115565 6117191 I could arrange passage.
6117859 6119444 My letter of transit?
6119694 6120862 I could use a trip.
6121070 6124240 But it doesn't change our bet.<br />You still owe me 10,000 francs.
6124490 6127493 And that 10,000 francs<br />should pay our expenses.
6127702 6129537 RICK:<br />"Our" expenses?
6129787 6130830 Louis...
6131039 6134751 ...I think this is the beginning<br />of a beautiful friendship.
