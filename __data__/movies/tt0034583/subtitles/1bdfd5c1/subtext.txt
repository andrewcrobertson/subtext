853474 854907 I DON'T BUY OR SELL<br />HUMAN BEINGS.
854942 856909 TOO BAD. THAT'S CASABLANCA'S<br />LEADING COMMODITY.
856944 858945 IN REFUGEES ALONE,<br />WE COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.
858980 861748 YOU COULD WORK WITH ME<br />THROUGH THE BLACK MARKET.
861783 863449 SUPPOSE YOU RUN<br />YOUR BUSINESS,
863484 864417 AND LET ME RUN MINE.
864452 867887 SUPPOSE WE ASK SAM.<br />MAYBE HE'D LIKE A CHANGE.
867922 868888 SUPPOSE WE DO.
868923 871891 WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE<br />THAT IN THIS WORLD TODAY,
871926 874527 ISOLATIONISM IS NO LONGER<br />A PRACTICAL POLICY?
874562 877363 SAM, FERRARI WANTS YOU<br />TO WORK FOR HIM.
877398 878665 I LIKE IT FINE HERE.
878700 879966 HE'LL DOUBLE<br />WHAT I PAY YOU.
880001 880933 YEAH,<br />BUT I AIN'T GOT TIME
880968 882702 TO SPEND THE MONEY<br />I MAKE HERE.
882737 884704 SORRY.
887709 889676 BOSS' PRIVATE STOCK...
889711 891811 BECAUSE, YVONNE,<br />I LOVE YOU.
891846 893079 OH, SHUT UP.
893114 895682 ALL RIGHT. FOR YOU,<br />I SHUT UP...
895717 898384 BECAUSE, YVONNE,<br />I LOVE YOU.
898419 899051 UH-OH.
899087 902955 SOME GERMANS<br />GAVE THIS CHECK.
902990 905625 IS IT ALL RIGHT?
908062 909829 WHERE WERE YOU<br />LAST NIGHT?
909864 913066 THAT'S SO LONG AGO,<br />I DON'T REMEMBER.
913101 914867 WILL I SEE YOU<br />TONIGHT?
914902 917904 I NEVER MAKE PLANS<br />THAT FAR AHEAD.
917939 919372 GIVE ME ANOTHER.
919407 920740 SACHA,<br />SHE'S HAD ENOUGH.
920775 922842 DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.<br />FILL IT UP.
922877 924510 YVONNE, I LOVE YOU,<br />BUT HE PAYS ME.
924545 926412 RICK, I'M SICK AND TIRED<br />OF HAVING YOU--
926447 927513 SACHA, CALL A CAB.
927548 929949 LET'S GET YOUR COAT.<br />YOU'RE GOING HOME.
929984 933420 YOU'VE HAD A LITTLE<br />TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
935056 936823 HEY, TAXI.
936858 939826 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU<br />ARE, PUSHING ME AROUND?
939861 941894 I WAS A FOOL TO FALL<br />FOR A MAN LIKE YOU.
941929 945598 MAKE SURE SHE GETS HOME...<br />AND COME RIGHT BACK.
945633 947634 YES, BOSS.
958780 959712 HELLO, RICK.
959747 960813 HELLO, LOUIS.
960848 963149 HOW EXTRAVAGANT YOU ARE,<br />THROWING AWAY WOMEN LIKE THAT.
963184 964317 SOMEDAY THEY MAY<br />BE SCARCE.
964352 967987 I THINK I'LL CALL ON YVONNE,<br />MAYBE GET HER ON THE REBOUND.
968022 971758 WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN,<br />YOU'RE A TRUE DEMOCRAT.
971793 974427 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
980868 982902 IF HE GETS A WORD IN,
982937 986639 IT'LL BE A MAJOR<br />ITALIAN VICTORY.
988843 991778 THE PLANE TO LISBON.
994849 997750 YOU WOULD LIKE<br />TO BE ON IT.
997785 999452 WHY?<br />WHAT'S IN LISBON?
999487 1000853 THE CLIPPER TO AMERICA.
1000888 1003990 I'VE OFTEN SPECULATED<br />ON WHY YOU DON'T RETURN.
1004025 1005925 DID YOU ABSCOND<br />WITH THE CHURCH FUNDS?
1005960 1007960 DID YOU RUN OFF WITH<br />A SENATOR'S WIFE?
1007995 1011030 I'D LIKE TO THINK<br />THAT YOU KILLED A MAN.
1011065 1012565 IT'S THE ROMANTIC<br />IN ME.
1012600 1013566 IT'S A COMBINATION<br />OF ALL 3.
1013601 1015201 WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME<br />BROUGHT YOU TO CASABLANCA?
1015236 1016002 MY HEALTH.
1016037 1017970 I CAME TO CASABLANCA<br />FOR THE WATERS.
1018005 1022809 THE WATERS? WHAT WATERS?<br />WE'RE IN THE DESERT.
1022844 1025645 I WAS MISINFORMED.
1026614 1027446 EXCUSE ME,<br />MONSIEUR RICK.
1027482 1030683 A GENTLEMAN INSIDE<br />HAS WON 20,000 FRANCS,
1030718 1033920 AND THE CASHIER<br />WOULD LIKE SOME MONEY.
1033955 1036656 I'LL GET IT<br />FROM THE SAFE.
1036691 1038858 I'M SO UPSET, MONSIEUR RICK.
1038893 1039926 FORGET IT, EMIL.
1039961 1041894 THINGS LIKE THAT<br />HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.
1041929 1042895 I'M AWFULLY SORRY.
1042930 1045732 [PLAYING<i> BABY FACE]</i>
1046000 1048968 THERE'S GOING TO BE<br />SOME EXCITEMENT TONIGHT.
1049003 1052572 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE<br />AN ARREST IN YOUR CAFE.
1052607 1053239 WHAT, AGAIN?
1053275 1054941 THIS IS<br />NO ORDINARY ARREST.
1054976 1056108 A MURDERER, NO LESS.
1056143 1057677 IF YOU'RE THINKING<br />OF WARNING HIM,
1057712 1058744 DON'T<br />PUT YOURSELF OUT.
1058779 1059946 HE CANNOT POSSIBLY<br />ESCAPE.
1059981 1062748 I STICK MY NECK OUT<br />FOR NOBODY.
1062783 1064817 A WISE FOREIGN POLICY.
1064852 1067119 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
1067154 1068521 WE COULD'VE<br />MADE THIS ARREST
1068556 1069922 EARLIER THIS EVENING<br />AT THE BLUE PARROT.
1069957 1073025 OUT OF MY REGARD FOR YOU,<br />WE'RE STAGING IT HERE.
1073060 1074894 IT WILL AMUSE<br />YOUR CUSTOMERS.
1074929 1076662 OUR ENTERTAINMENT'S<br />ENOUGH.
1076697 1078998 WE'LL HAVE AN IMPORTANT<br />GUEST HERE TONIGHT,
1079033 1081267 MAJOR STRASSER<br />OF THE THIRD REICH, NO LESS.
1081302 1084003 WE WANT HIM TO BE HERE<br />WHEN WE MAKE THE ARREST.
1084038 1085972 A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION<br />OF THE EFFICIENCY
1086007 1086906 OF MY ADMINISTRATION.
1086941 1088541 WHAT'S STRASSER<br />DOING HERE?
1088576 1090743 HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T<br />COME TO CASABLANCA
1090778 1092178 TO WITNESS<br />A DEMONSTRATION
1092213 1093846 OF YOUR EFFICIENCY.
1093881 1094480 PERHAPS NOT.
1094515 1096282 IT SHALL NOT<br />HAPPEN AGAIN.
1096317 1097016 IT'S ALL RIGHT.
1097051 1098818 LOUIS, SOMETHING'S<br />ON YOUR MIND.
1098853 1100686 WHY DON'T YOU<br />SPILL IT?
1100721 1101520 HOW OBSERVANT YOU ARE.
1101555 1104824 I WANTED TO GIVE YOU<br />A WORD OF ADVICE.
1104859 1106893 YEAH?<br />HAVE A BRANDY?
1106928 1107827 THANK YOU.
1107863 1110930 THERE ARE MANY EXIT VISAS<br />SOLD IN THIS CAFE,
1110965 1113533 BUT WE KNOW<br />YOU'VE NEVER SOLD ONE.
1113568 1115868 THAT IS THE REASON<br />WE PERMIT YOU TO REMAIN OPEN.
1115903 1120006 I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE<br />I LET YOU WIN AT ROULETTE.
1120041 1121040 THAT IS ANOTHER REASON.
1121076 1123943 A MAN ARRIVED IN CASABLANCA<br />ON HIS WAY TO AMERICA.
1123978 1124777 HE'LL OFFER A FORTUNE<br />TO ANYONE
1124812 1126979 WHO WILL FURNISH HIM<br />WITH AN EXIT VISA.
1127014 1127947 WHAT'S HIS NAME?
1127982 1129682 VICTOR LASZLO.
1129717 1130816 VICTOR LASZLO?
1130852 1132585 THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE<br />EVER SEEN YOU SO IMPRESSED.
1132620 1133920 WELL, HE'S IMPRESSED<br />HALF THE WORLD.
1133955 1137990 IT'S MY DUTY TO SEE HE DOESN'T<br />IMPRESS THE OTHER HALF.
1138025 1139859 RICK, LASZLO MUST NEVER<br />REACH AMERICA.
1139894 1140793 HE STAYS IN CASABLANCA.
1140829 1144330 IT WILL BE INTERESTING<br />TO SEE HOW HE MANAGES.
1144365 1145698 MANAGES WHAT?
1145733 1146632 HIS ESCAPE.
1146667 1147700 BUT I TOLD YOU--
1147735 1149101 STOP IT. SINCE HIS ESCAPE<br />FROM A CONCENTRATION CAMP,
1149136 1152004 THE NAZIS HAVE CHASED HIM<br />ALL OVER EUROPE.
1152039 1154574 THIS IS THE END<br />OF THE CHASE.
1154609 1156642 20,000 FRANCS<br />SAYS IT ISN'T.
1156677 1158344 IS THAT<br />A SERIOUS OFFER?
1158379 1161681 I JUST PAID OUT 20.<br />I'D LIKE IT BACK.
1161716 1162448 MAKE IT 10.
1162484 1165685 I'M ONLY A POOR,<br />CORRUPT OFFICIAL.
1165720 1166452 OK.
1166488 1168154 DONE. NO MATTER<br />HOW CLEVER HE IS,
1168189 1169956 HE STILL NEEDS<br />AN EXIT VISA.
1169991 1170823 I SHOULD SAY 2.<br />WHY 2?
1170858 1172625 HE'S TRAVELING<br />WITH A LADY.
1172660 1174093 HE'LL TAKE ONE.
1174128 1175828 I THINK NOT.<br />I'VE SEEN THE LADY.
1175863 1178130 IF HE DIDN'T LEAVE<br />HER IN MARSEILLES,
1178165 1180967 HE CERTAINLY WON'T<br />LEAVE HER IN CASABLANCA.
1181002 1183836 MAYBE HE'S NOT QUITE<br />AS ROMANTIC AS YOU ARE.
1183871 1184870 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
1184905 1186939 THERE'S NO EXIT VISA<br />FOR HIM.
1186974 1188174 WHATEVER GAVE YOU<br />THE IMPRESSION
1188209 1191010 THAT I'D BE INTERESTED<br />IN HELPING LASZLO ESCAPE?
1191045 1194246 BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT<br />UNDER THAT CYNICAL SHELL,
1194281 1196849 YOU'RE AT HEART<br />A SENTIMENTALIST.
1196884 1198017 LAUGH IF YOU WILL,
1198052 1200786 BUT I'M FAMILIAR<br />WITH YOUR RECORD.
1200821 1202822 LET ME POINT OUT<br />JUST 2 ITEMS.
1202857 1206659 IN 1935, YOU RAN GUNS<br />TO ETHIOPIA.
1206694 1209929 IN 1936,<br />YOU FOUGHT IN SPAIN
1209964 1210796 ON THE LOYALIST SIDE.
1210832 1213966 I GOT WELL PAID FOR IT<br />ON BOTH OCCASIONS.
1214001 1214700 THE WINNING SIDE
1214735 1216402 WOULD HAVE PAID YOU<br />MUCH BETTER.
1216437 1217370 MAYBE.
1217405 1220873 IT SEEMS YOU'RE DETERMINED<br />TO KEEP LASZLO HERE.
1220908 1223342 I HAVE MY ORDERS.
1223377 1225144 I SEE. GESTAPO SPANK.
1225179 1227079 YOU OVERESTIMATE<br />THE INFLUENCE
1227114 1228180 OF THE GESTAPO.
1228215 1229949 I DON'T INTERFERE<br />WITH THEM.
1229984 1231717 THEY DON'T<br />INTERFERE WITH ME.
1231752 1234053 IN CASABLANCA, I'M<br />MASTER OF MY FATE.
1234088 1236422 MAJOR STRASSER'S<br />HERE, SIR.
1236457 1238190 YOU WERE SAYING.
1238225 1240093 EXCUSE ME.
1247868 1250970 CARL, SEE THAT MAJOR STRASSER<br />GETS A GOOD TABLE.
1251005 1251937 ONE CLOSE TO THE LADIES.
1251972 1253906 I'VE ALREADY<br />GIVEN HIM THE BEST,
1253941 1254907 KNOWING HE'S GERMAN
1254942 1257276 AND WOULD TAKE IT<br />ANYWAY.
1258245 1262014 TAKE HIM QUIETLY.<br />2 GUARDS AT EVERY DOOR.
1262049 1263383 YES, SIR.
1266020 1267987 EVERYTHING<br />IS READY, SIR.
1268022 1269355 GO AHEAD.
1274495 1275861 GOOD EVENING,<br />GENTLEMEN.
1275896 1277163 GOOD EVENING, CAPTAIN.
1277198 1278998 WON'T YOU JOIN US?
1279033 1279865 THANK YOU.
1279901 1282802 IT'S A PLEASURE<br />TO HAVE YOU HERE, MAJOR.
1282837 1284070 CHAMPAGNE<br />AND CAVIAR.
1284105 1286238 MAY I RECOMMEND<br />VEUVE CLIQUOT '26?
1286273 1287940 A GOOD FRENCH WINE.
1287975 1289842 VERY WELL, SIR.
1289877 1291844 VERY INTERESTING CLUB.
1291879 1293012 ESPECIALLY SO<br />TONIGHT, MAJOR.
1293047 1294480 IN A FEW MINUTES<br />YOU'LL SEE THE ARREST
1294515 1296882 OF THE MAN WHO MURDERED<br />YOUR COURIERS.
1296917 1298951 I EXPECTED NO LESS,<br />CAPTAIN.
1298986 1301320 MONSIEUR UGARTE.
1301355 1302822 OH.
1302857 1303823 YES?
1303858 1306726 WILL YOU PLEASE<br />COME WITH US?
1306761 1307460 CERTAINLY.
1307495 1309195 MAY I FIRST PLEASE<br />CASH MY CHIPS?
1309230 1313966 [SPEAKING<br />FRENCH]
1316103 1317970 PRETTY LUCKY, HUH?

1359980 1362281 I STICK MY NECK OUT<br />FOR NOBODY.
1362316 1363916 I'M SORRY THERE WAS<br />A DISTURBANCE, FOLKS,
1363951 1365384 BUT IT'S ALL OVER NOW.<br />EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.
1365419 1367520 JUST SIT DOWN<br />AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
1367555 1369455 ENJOY YOURSELVES.<br />ALL RIGHT, SAM.
1369490 1373259 [MUSIC PLAYS]
1375229 1376028 RICK.
1376063 1379064 RICK, THIS IS MAJOR<br />HEINRICH STRASSER
1379099 1380800 OF THE THIRD REICH.
1380835 1382301 HOW DO YOU DO?
1382336 1384804 YOU ALREADY KNOW<br />HERR HEINZE.
1384839 1387940 PLEASE JOIN US,<br />MR. RICK.
1390344 1392378 WE ARE HONORED<br />TONIGHT, RICK.
1392413 1394280 MAJOR STRASSER<br />IS ONE REASON
1394315 1395447 THE THIRD REICH<br />ENJOYS
1395482 1397283 THE REPUTATION<br />IT HAS TODAY.
1397318 1398450 YOU REPEAT<br />THIRD REICH
1398485 1400486 AS THOUGH YOU EXPECTED<br />THERE TO BE OTHERS.
1400521 1402288 PERSONALLY, MAJOR<br />I'LL TAKE WHAT COMES.
1402323 1405891 MAY I ASK A FEW QUESTIONS--<br />UNOFFICIALLY, OF COURSE?
1405926 1408060 MAKE IT OFFICIAL<br />IF YOU LIKE.
1408095 1409929 WHAT IS YOUR<br />NATIONALITY?
1409964 1411130 I'M A DRUNKARD.
1411165 1414600 THAT MAKES RICK<br />A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.
1414635 1417536 I WAS BORN IN NEW YORK CITY<br />IF THAT'LL HELP YOU ANY.
1417571 1420840 YOU CAME HERE FROM PARIS<br />DURING THE OCCUPATION?
1420875 1422341 THERE'S NO SECRET<br />ABOUT THAT.
1422376 1424910 ARE YOU ONE<br />OF THOSE PEOPLE
1424945 1426445 WHO CANNOT<br />IMAGINE GERMANS
1426480 1427479 IN THEIR BELOVED PARIS?
1427515 1430249 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY<br /><i>MY</i> BELOVED PARIS.
1430284 1432251 CAN YOU IMAGINE US<br />IN LONDON?
1432286 1435321 WHEN YOU GET THERE,<br />ASK ME.
1435356 1436488 DIPLOMATIST.
1436523 1437456 HOW ABOUT NEW YORK?
1437491 1440593 THERE ARE CERTAIN SECTIONS<br />OF NEW YORK, MAJOR,
1440628 1443395 THAT I WOULDN'T ADVISE YOU<br />TO TRY TO INVADE.
1443430 1445631 WHO DO YOU THINK<br />WILL WIN THE WAR?
1445666 1447333 I HAVEN'T<br />THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.
1447368 1449535 RICK IS NEUTRAL<br />ABOUT EVERYTHING.
1449570 1451203 THAT INCLUDES<br />WOMEN, TOO.
1451238 1453572 YOU WERE NOT ALWAYS<br />SO NEUTRAL.
1453607 1456642 WE HAVE A COMPLETE<br />DOSSIER ON YOU.
1456677 1458644 "RICHARD BLAINE,<br />AMERICAN, 37.
1458679 1460880 CANNOT RETURN<br />TO HIS COUNTRY."
1460915 1462581 THE REASON<br />IS A LITTLE VAGUE.
1462616 1465317 WE ALSO KNOW WHAT<br />YOU DID IN PARIS
1465352 1466251 AND WHY YOU LEFT PARIS.
1466287 1469421 DON'T WORRY. WE AREN'T<br />GOING TO BROADCAST IT.
1469456 1471357 ARE MY EYES<br />REALLY BROWN?
1471392 1473259 FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY.
1473294 1474227 THE POINT IS,
1474262 1475895 AN ENEMY OF THE REICH<br />HAS COME TO CASABLANCA,
1475930 1479398 AND WE ARE CHECKING UP<br />ON ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP.
1479433 1482968 MY INTEREST IN WHETHER<br />VICTOR LASZLO STAYS OR GOES
1483003 1484937 IS PURELY A SPORTING ONE.
1484972 1488173 IN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE<br />NO SYMPATHY FOR THE FOX?
1488208 1489107 NOT PARTICULARLY.
1489143 1491377 I UNDERSTAND THE HOUND'S<br />POINT OF VIEW, TOO.
1491412 1493946 VICTOR LASZLO PUBLISHED<br />THE FOULEST LIES
1493981 1497483 IN THE PRAGUE NEWSPAPERS<br />UNTIL WE MARCHED IN.
1497518 1498317 EVEN AFTER THAT,
1498352 1501353 HE PRINTED SCANDAL<br />SHEETS IN A CELLAR.
1501388 1502521 ONE MUST ADMIT
1502556 1504256 HE HAS GREAT<br />COURAGE.
1504291 1506058 I ADMIT<br />HE'S VERY CLEVER.

2958811 2961011 WITH A COMICAL LOOK<br />ON HIS FACE
2961046 2964682 BECAUSE HIS INSIDES<br />HAD BEEN KICKED OUT.

2967486 2969120 HAS IT GOT<br />A WOW FINISH?
2969155 2971455 I DON'T KNOW<br />THE FINISH YET.
2971490 2972957 GO ON, TELL IT.
2972992 2976494 MAYBE ONE'LL COME TO YOU<br />AS YOU GO ALONG.
2977630 2978696 IT'S ABOUT A GIRL
2978731 2980831 WHO HAD JUST<br />COME TO PARIS
2980866 2981732 FROM HER HOME IN OSLO.
2981767 2984969 AT THE HOUSE OF SOME<br />FRIENDS, SHE MET A MAN
2985004 2987605 ABOUT WHOM SHE HAD HEARD<br />HER WHOLE LIFE,
2987640 2989607 A VERY GREAT<br />AND COURAGEOUS MAN.
2989642 2992643 HE OPENED UP FOR HER<br />A WHOLE BEAUTIFUL WORLD
2992678 2995079 FULL OF KNOWLEDGE<br />AND THOUGHTS AND IDEALS.
2995114 2998082 EVERYTHING SHE KNEW<br />OR EVER BECAME
2998117 2998916 WAS BECAUSE OF HIM.
2998951 3002953 SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM<br />AND WORSHIPPED HIM
3002988 3006056 WITH A FEELING<br />SHE SUPPOSED WAS LOVE.
3006091 3008759 YES. IT'S VERY PRETTY.<br />I HEARD A STORY ONCE.
3008794 3011662 I'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES<br />IN MY TIME.
3011697 3015866 THEY WENT ALONG WITH THE SOUND<br />OF A TINNY PIANO
3015901 3017701 PLAYING IN THE PARLOR<br />DOWNSTAIRS.
3017736 3022173 "MISTER, I MET A MAN ONCE<br />WHEN I WAS A KID,"
3022208 3023274 IT ALWAYS BEGINS.
3023309 3029547 OH, I GUESS NEITHER ONE<br />OF OUR STORIES IS VERY FUNNY.
3029582 3032650 TELL ME, WHO WAS IT<br />YOU LEFT ME FOR?
3032685 3036754 WAS IT LASZLO, OR WERE THERE<br />OTHERS IN BETWEEN--
3036789 3040792 OR AREN'T YOU<br />THE KIND THAT TELLS?

3071690 3072623 IF RICK HAS THE LETTERS,
3072658 3074592 HE'S MUCH TOO SMART TO<br />LET YOU FIND THEM THERE.
3074627 3077828 YOU GIVE HIM CREDIT<br />FOR TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS.
3077863 3079730 HE'S JUST ANOTHER<br />BLUNDERING AMERICAN.
3079765 3082266 WE MUSTN'T UNDERESTIMATE<br />AMERICAN BLUNDERING.

3186372 3187204 AT YOUR DISPOSAL,

3302221 3304455 THANKS.
3315434 3317501 DON'T BE TOO<br />DOWNHEARTED.
3317536 3320204 PERHAPS YOU CAN<br />COME TO TERMS
3320239 3321805 WITH CAPTAIN RENAULT.
3321840 3323140 HELLO, FERRARI.
3323175 3324341 GOOD MORNING,<br />RICK.
3324376 3325442 I SEE THE BUS IS IN.
3325477 3326410 I'LL TAKE<br />MY SHIPMENT WITH ME.
3326445 3328779 NO HURRY. I'LL HAVE IT<br />SENT OVER. HAVE A DRINK.
3328814 3331014 EVERY TIME YOU SEND<br />MY SHIPMENT OVER,
3331049 3332349 IT'S ALWAYS<br />A LITTLE SHORT.
3332384 3334785 CARRYING CHARGES,<br />MY BOY.
3334820 3335753 HERE, SIT DOWN.
3335788 3339857 THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT<br />TO TALK OVER WITH YOU.
3339892 3340591 THE BOURBON.
3340626 3342993 THE NEWS ABOUT UGARTE<br />UPSETS ME.
3343028 3343994 YOU'RE A FAT HYPOCRITE.
3344029 3346864 YOU DON'T FEEL ANY SORRIER<br />FOR UGARTE THAN I DO.
3346899 3347665 OF COURSE NOT.
3347700 3349299 WHAT UPSETS ME<br />IS THAT UGARTE'S DEAD,
3349334 3352169 AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THOSE<br />LETTERS OF TRANSIT ARE.
3352204 3353470 PRACTICALLY NO ONE.
3353505 3355405 IF I COULD<br />LAY MY HANDS ON THEM,
3355440 3356272 I COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.
3356308 3358408 SO COULD I, AND I'M<br />A POOR BUSINESSMAN.
3358443 3359376 I HAVE A PROPOSITION
3359411 3361078 FOR WHOEVER HAS<br />THOSE LETTERS.
3361113 3362479 I'LL HANDLE<br />THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION,
3362514 3365382 TAKE ALL THE RISK,<br />FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE.
3365417 3367050 AND THE CARRYING<br />CHARGES?
3367085 3370053 NATURALLY THERE WILL BE<br />A FEW INCIDENTAL EXPENSES.
3370088 3371455 THAT'S THE PROPOSITION<br />I HAVE
3371490 3373056 FOR WHOEVER<br />HAS THOSE LETTERS.
3373091 3374525 I'LL TELL HIM<br />WHEN HE COMES IN.
3374560 3377561 I THINK YOU KNOW<br />WHERE THOSE LETTERS ARE.
3377596 3378495 YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY.
3378531 3382399 RENAULT AND STRASSER<br />PROBABLY THINK SO, TOO.
3386104 3387838 THAT'S WHY<br />I CAME OVER HERE,
3387873 3390207 TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE<br />TO RANSACK MY PLACE.
3390242 3392910 DON'T BE A FOOL. TAKE ME<br />INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE.
3392945 3393644 YOU NEED A PARTNER.
3393679 3396547 EXCUSE ME.<br />I'LL BE GETTING BACK.
3398250 3399116 GOOD MORNING.
3399151 3403354 SIGNOR FERRARI'S<br />THE FAT GENT AT THE TABLE.
3406525 3410894 YOU WILL NOT FIND A TREASURE<br />LIKE THIS IN ALL MOROCCO.
3410929 3412296 ONLY 700 FRANCS.
3412331 3413430 YOU'RE BEING CHEATED.
3413465 3414965 IT DOESN'T MATTER.<br />THANK YOU.
3415000 3415966 THE LADY'S A FRIEND<br />OF RICK'S.
3416001 3418435 FOR FRIENDS OF RICK'S,<br />WE HAVE A SMALL DISCOUNT.
3418470 3419503 DID I SAY 700?
3419538 3421371 YOU CAN HAVE IT<br />FOR 200.
3421406 3423473 I'M SORRY I WAS<br />IN NO CONDITION
3423508 3425175 TO RECEIVE YOU<br />LAST NIGHT.
3425210 3426410 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
3426445 3427878 FOR SPECIAL FRIENDS<br />OF RICK'S,
3427913 3429279 A SPECIAL DISCOUNT--<br />100 FRANCS.
3429314 3432015 YOUR STORY HAD ME<br />A LITTLE CONFUSED.
3432050 3433383 MAYBE IT WAS THE BOURBON.
3433418 3435252 I HAVE SOME TABLECLOTHS,<br />SOME NAPKINS.
3435287 3436420 THANK YOU.<br />I'M NOT INTERESTED.
3436455 3438088 PLEASE, ONE MINUTE.
3438123 3439356 WHY DID YOU COME BACK,
3439391 3441158 TO TELL ME WHY<br />YOU RAN OUT ON ME
3441193 3442893 AT THE RAILWAY STATION.
3442928 3443794 YES.
3443829 3446163 YOU CAN TELL ME NOW.<br />I'M REASONABLY SOBER.
3446198 3447097 I DON'T THINK I WILL.
3447133 3450500 WHY NOT? I GOT STUCK<br />WITH THE RAILWAY TICKET.
3450535 3452269 I THINK I'M ENTITLED<br />TO KNOW.
3452304 3454538 LAST NIGHT, I SAW WHAT<br />HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.
3454573 3456039 THE RICK I KNEW<br />IN PARIS,
3456074 3457541 I COULD TELL HIM.<br />HE WOULD UNDERSTAND.
3457576 3460944 THE ONE WHO LOOKED AT ME<br />WITH SUCH HATRED...
3460979 3462913 I'LL BE LEAVING<br />CASABLANCA SOON.
3462948 3465215 WE'LL NEVER SEE<br />EACH OTHER AGAIN.
3465250 3468385 WE KNEW VERY LITTLE<br />ABOUT EACH OTHER
3468420 3471054 WHEN WE WERE IN LOVE<br />IN PARIS.
3471089 3472890 IF WE LEAVE IT THAT WAY,
3472925 3474424 MAYBE WE'LL REMEMBER<br />THOSE DAYS
3474459 3475492 AND NOT CASABLANCA.
3475527 3477394 NOT LAST NIGHT.
3477429 3479363 DID YOU RUN OUT ON ME
3479398 3481031 BECAUSE YOU<br />COULDN'T TAKE IT--
3481066 3483600 HIDING FROM THE POLICE,<br />RUNNING AWAY ALL THIS TIME?
3483635 3485602 YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT<br />IF YOU WANT TO.
3485637 3486536 I'M NOT<br />RUNNING AWAY ANYMORE.
3486572 3489473 I'M SETTLED NOW--<br />ABOVE A SALOON, IT'S TRUE,
3489508 3495312 BUT WALK UP A FLIGHT.<br />I'LL BE EXPECTING YOU.
3495514 3499483 ALL THE SAME, SOMEDAY<br />YOU'LL LIE TO LASZLO.
3499518 3501652 YOU'LL BE THERE.
3502487 3504254 NO, RICK.
3504289 3505923 NO. YOU SEE,
3505958 3508025 VICTOR LASZLO'S<br />MY HUSBAND.
3508060 3512363 AND WAS, EVEN WHEN<br />I KNEW YOU IN PARIS.
3515667 3518168 I WAS JUST TELLING<br />MONSIEUR LASZLO
3518203 3519202 THAT UNFORTUNATELY
3519237 3521004 I'M NOT ABLE<br />TO HELP HIM.
3521039 3522639 THE WORD<br />HAS GONE AROUND.
3522674 3525175 AS LEADER OF ALL<br />ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
3525210 3525976 IN CASABLANCA,
3526011 3528011 I'M AN INFLUENTIAL<br />AND RESPECTED MAN.
3528046 3530080 IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH<br />MY LIFE
3530115 3531415 TO DO ANYTHING<br />MONSIEUR LASZLO.
3531450 3533550 YOU, HOWEVER, ARE<br />A DIFFERENT MATTER.
3533585 3536353 SIGNOR FERRARI THINKS<br />IT MIGHT JUST BE POSSIBLE
3536388 3539489 TO GET AN EXIT VISA<br />FOR YOU.
3539524 3541391 YOU MEAN FOR ME<br />TO GO ON ALONE?
3541426 3542459 Ferrari:<br />AND ONLY ALONE.
3542494 3545495 I'LL STAY HERE<br />AND KEEP ON TRYING.
3545530 3547164 YOU MIGHT AS WELL<br />BE FRANK.
3547199 3548432 IT WOULD TAKE<br />A MIRACLE
3548467 3549199 TO GET YOU OUT<br />OF CASABLANCA,
3549235 3551168 AND THE GERMANS<br />OUTLAWED MIRACLES.
3551203 3554037 WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED<br />IN 2 VISAS.
3554072 3556039 PLEASE, ILSA,<br />DON'T BE HASTY.
3556074 3558542 YOU TWO WILL WANT<br />TO DISCUSS THIS.
3558577 3562513 EXCUSE ME.<br />I'LL BE AT THE BAR.
3564149 3566283 I WON'T LET YOU<br />STAY HERE.
3566318 3569653 YOU MUST GET TO AMERICA.<br />SOMEHOW I'LL JOIN YOU.
3569688 3571455 IF THE SITUATION<br />WERE DIFFERENT.
3571490 3572189 IF I HAD TO STAY
3572224 3574458 AND THERE WERE<br />ONLY VISA FOR ONE,
3574493 3576393 WOULD YOU TAKE IT?
3576428 3578528 YES, I WOULD.
3578563 3580664 YES, I SEE.
3580699 3583266 WHEN I HAD TROUBLE<br />GETTING OUT OF LILLES,
3583301 3585535 WHY DIDN'T YOU<br />LEAVE ME THERE?
3585570 3586636 WHEN I WAS SICK<br />IN MARSEILLES
3586671 3587671 AND HELD YOU UP<br />FOR 2 WEEKS,
3587706 3589373 AND YOU WERE IN<br />DANGER EVERY MINUTE,
3589408 3591641 WHY DIDN'T YOU<br />LEAVE ME THEN?
3591676 3596580 I MEANT TO, BUT SOMETHING<br />ALWAYS HELD ME UP.
3597516 3599549 I LOVE YOU<br />VERY MUCH, ILSA.
3599584 3602786 YOUR SECRET WILL BE<br />SAFE WITH ME.
3602821 3606223 FERRARI'S WAITING<br />FOR OUR ANSWER.
3606258 3610427 NOT MORE THAN<br />50 FRANCS, THOUGH.
3611763 3613363 WE HAVE DECIDED,<br />SIGNOR FERRARI.
3613398 3617501 FOR THE PRESENT, WE'RE ONLY<br />LOOKING FOR 2 EXIT VISAS.
3617536 3619102 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
3619137 3620370 GOOD LUCK, BUT BE CAREFUL.
3620405 3621705 YOU KNOW THAT<br />YOU'RE BEING SHADOWED?
3621740 3623540 OF COURSE.<br />IT BECOMES AN INSTINCT.
3623575 3626743 IN ONE RESPECT, YOU ARE<br />A VERY FORTUNATE MAN, MONSIEUR.
3626778 3630113 I MOVE TO MAKE ONE MORE<br />SUGGESTION. WHY, I DON'T KNOW,
3630148 3631648 BECAUSE IT CANNOT<br />POSSIBLY PROFIT ME.
3631683 3634051 HAVE YOU HEARD<br />ABOUT SIGNOR UGARTE
3634086 3635285 AND THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT?
3635320 3636253 YES. SOMETHING.
3636288 3639556 THEY WEREN'T ON UGARTE<br />WHEN THEY ARRESTED HIM.
3639591 3641124 WHERE ARE THEY?
3641159 3643226 NOT FOUR SURE.<br />I'LL VENTURE TO GUESS
3643261 3646129 THAT UGARTE LEFT THEM<br />WITH MONSIEUR RICK.
3646164 3647030 RICK?
3647065 3650600 ONE NEVER KNOWS<br />WHAT RICK WILL DO OR WHY,
3650635 3653103 BUT IT IS WORTH A CHANCE.
3653138 3655372 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.<br />GOOD DAY.
3655407 3657507 GOODBYE. THANK YOU<br />FOR YOUR COFFEE.
3657542 3658842 I SHALL MISS THAT
3658877 3659810 WHEN WE LEAVE<br />CASABLANCA.
3659845 3664347 GRACIOUS OF YOU TO SHARE IT<br />WITH ME. GOOD DAY.
3664382 3666417 GOOD DAY.
3671590 3674658 [PIANO PLAYING]
3674693 3676493 HERE'S TO YOU, SIR.
3676528 3677461 GOOD LUCK.
3677496 3679196 I'D BETTER BE GOING.
3679231 3680464 MY CHECK, PLEASE.
3680499 3681398 I HAVE TO WARN YOU.
3681434 3683233 THIS IS A DANGEROUS PLACE<br />FULL OF VULTURES.
3683268 3685268 VULTURES EVERYWHERE.<br />THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
3685303 3686369 GOODBYE, SIR.
3686404 3690407 A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.<br />I'M SORRY.
3704556 3709726 MONSIEUR RICK, YOU ARE GETTING<br />TO BE YOUR BEST CUSTOMER.
3710228 3713463 DRINKING? NOW YOU'RE BEGINNING<br />TO LIVE LIKE A FRENCHMAN.
3713498 3716566 THAT'S SOME GOING-OVER<br />YOUR MEN GAVE MY PLACE.
3716601 3719536 WE BARELY GOT CLEANED UP<br />IN TIME TO OPEN.
3719571 3722472 I TOLD STRASSER<br />THE LETTERS WEREN'T HERE,
3722507 3725475 BUT I TOLD MY MEN TO BE<br />ESPECIALLY DESTRUCTIVE.
3725510 3727511 YOU KNOW HOW THAT<br />IMPRESSES GERMANS.
3727546 3730680 RICK, HAVE YOU GOT<br />THOSE LETTERS OF TRANSIT?
3730715 3733550 ARE YOU PRO-VICHY<br />OR FREE FRENCH?
3733585 3736786 SERVES ME RIGHT FOR ASKING<br />A DIRECT QUESTION.
3736821 3738421 THE SUBJECT IS CLOSED.
3738456 3741792 LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE<br />A LITTLE LATE.
3745597 3746363 HA HA HA!
3746398 3749332 SO YVONNE'S GONE OVER<br />TO THE ENEMY?
3749367 3750934 WHO KNOWS?<br />IN HER OWN WAY,
3750969 3753403 SHE MAY CONSTITUTE<br />AN ENTIRE SECOND FRONT.
3753438 3758408 IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FLATTER<br />MAJOR STRASSER A LITTLE.
3758443 3759609 SACHA!
3759644 3760744 FRENCH 75s.
3760779 3763446 WE'LL HAVE<br />A WHOLE ROW, SACHA,
3763481 3765382 STARTING HERE<br />AND ENDING HERE!
3765417 3766783 WE WILL BEGIN<br />WITH 2.
3766818 3768485 <i>VOUS N'ETES PAS</i><br /><i>FRANCAISE VOUS,</i>
3768520 3770420 <i>D'ALLER AVEC</i><br /><i>LES BOCHES COMME CA!</i>
3770455 3772455 <i>DE QUOI</i><br /><i>VOUS MELEZ-VOUS?</i>
3772490 3773423 NO, NO, NO.
3773458 3776793 WHAT DID YOU SAY?<br />WOULD YOU KINDLY REPEAT IT?
3776828 3779796 IT'S NONE<br />OF YOUR BUSINESS!
3779831 3781364 I'LL MAKE IT<br />MY BUSINESS.
3781399 3783366 <i>ARRETEZ,</i><br /><i>JE VOUS EN PRIE!</i>
3783401 3786436 <i>JE VOUS EN PRIE,</i><br /><i>ARRETEZ!</i>
3786471 3788338 I DON'T LIKE<br />DISTURBANCES HERE.
3788373 3791641 EITHER LAY OFF POLITICS<br />OR GET OUT!
3791676 3793777 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
3793812 3797480 YOU SEE, CAPTAIN,<br />THE SITUATION IS NOT AS MUCH
3797515 3798949 UNDER CONTROL<br />AS YOU BELIEVE.
3798984 3802285 WE'RE TRYING TO COOPERATE<br />WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT.
3802320 3804621 WE CANNOT REGULATE<br />OUR PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.
3804656 3806590 ARE YOU CERTAIN<br />WHICH SIDE YOU ARE ON?
3806625 3809659 I HAVE NO CONVICTION.<br />I BLOW WITH THE WIND.
3809694 3812862 THE PREVAILING WIND<br />HAPPENS TO BE FROM VICHY.
3812897 3814464 AND IF IT SHOULD<br />CHANGE?
3814499 3817534 SURELY THE REICH DOESN'T<br />ADMIT THAT POSSIBILITY.
3817569 3819502 WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT<br />MORE THAN CASABLANCA.
3819537 3821938 WE KNOW EVERY FRENCH<br />PROVINCE IN AFRICA
3821973 3823607 IS HONEYCOMBED<br />WITH TRAITORS
3823642 3826943 WAITING FOR THEIR CHANCE,<br />PERHAPS FOR A LEADER.
3826978 3827810 A LEADER? LIKE LASZLO?
3827846 3830914 IT'S TOO DANGEROUS<br />IF YOU LET HIM GO.
3830949 3834417 IT MAY BE TOO DANGEROUS<br />IF YOU LET HIM STAY.
3834452 3835552 I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.
3835587 3839423 [SPEAKING GERMAN]
3840292 3841524 THANK YOU, CARL.
3841559 3843260 [SPEAKING GERMAN]
3843295 3844327 THANK YOU, CARL.
3844362 3846997 CARL, SIT DOWN.<br />HAVE A BRANDY WITH US.
3847032 3850333 TO CELEBRATE OUR LEAVING<br />FOR AMERICA TOMORROW.
3850368 3852402 THANK YOU. I THOUGHT<br />YOU WOULD ASK ME,
3852437 3856539 SO I BROUGHT THE GOOD BRANDY...<br />AND...A THIRD GLASS.
3856574 3858575 AT LAST,<br />THE DAY IS CAME!
3858610 3861611 WE ARE SPEAKING<br />NOTHING BUT ENGLISH NOW.
3861646 3864848 SO WE SHOULD FEEL<br />AT HOME IN AMERICA.
3864883 3867284 VERY NICE IDEA.<br />HA HA.
3867319 3868618 TO AMERICA.
3868653 3870520 TO AMERICA.
3870555 3872556 TO AMERICA.
3874559 3879429 <i>LIEBCHEN,</i> SWEETNESS,<br />WHAT WATCH?
3880365 3881665 10:00 WATCH.
3881700 3883566 SUCH MUCH?
3883601 3886736 YOU WILL GET ALONG<br />BEAUTIFULLY IN AMERICA.
3886771 3889606 HOW'S LADY LUCK<br />TREATING YOU?
3889641 3890640 OH, TOO BAD.
3890675 3893710 YOU'LL FIND HIM<br />OVER THERE.
3898483 3900550 MONSIEUR RICK?<br />YES.
3900585 3902652 COULD I SPEAK<br />TO YOU, PLEASE?
3902687 3904888 HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?<br />YOU'RE UNDERAGE.
3904923 3906556 I CAME WITH<br />CAPTAIN RENAULT.
3906591 3908525 OH, I SHOULD HAVE<br />KNOWN.
3908560 3910493 MY HUSBAND<br />IS WITH ME, TOO.
3910528 3912362 HE IS? CAPTAIN RENAULT'S<br />GETTING BROAD-MINDED.
3912397 3914998 WILL YOU HAVE A DRINK?<br />OF COURSE NOT.
3915033 3916633 DO YOU MIND IF I DO?
3916668 3919469 WHAT KIND OF A MAN<br />IS CAPTAIN RENAULT?
3919504 3921538 LIKE ANY OTHER,<br />ONLY MORE SO.
3921573 3925342 NO, I MEAN, IS HE TRUSTWORTHY?<br />IS HIS WORD--
3925377 3928478 WAIT. WHO TOLD YOU<br />TO ASK ME THAT?
3928513 3930347 HE DID.<br />CAPTAIN RENAULT DID.
3930382 3931881 I THOUGHT SO.<br />WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
3931916 3932982 AT THE ROULETTE TABLE,
3933017 3936953 TRYING TO WIN ENOUGH<br />FOR OUR EXIT VISAS.
3936988 3938722 OF COURSE HE'S LOSING.
3938757 3941458 HOW LONG HAVE YOU<br />BEEN MARRIED?
3941493 3943827 8 WEEKS.<br />WE COME FROM BULGARIA.
3943862 3945628 THINGS ARE VERY<br />BAD THERE.
3945663 3948631 THE DEVIL HAS THE PEOPLE<br />BY THE THROAT.
3948666 3952135 JAN AND I, WE DO NOT<br />WANT OUR CHILDREN
3952170 3954904 TO GROW UP<br />IN SUCH A COUNTRY.
3954939 3957407 SO YOU DECIDED<br />TO GO TO AMERICA.
3957442 3959109 YES, BUT WE HAVEN'T<br />MUCH MONEY.
3959144 3961511 TRAVELING IS SO EXPENSIVE<br />AND DIFFICULT.
3961546 3965482 IT WAS MUCH MORE<br />THAN WE THOUGHT TO GET HERE.
3965517 3967384 THEN CAPTAIN RENAULT<br />SEES US.

3995547 3999516 SO THAT YOUR HAPPINESS WAS<br />THE ONLY THING THAT SHE WANTED,
3999551 4003787 BUT SHE DID A BAD THING<br />TO MAKE CERTAIN OF IT,
4003822 4005088 COULD YOU FORGIVE HER?
4005123 4007424 NOBODY EVER LOVED ME<br />THAT MUCH.
4007459 4008492 AND HE NEVER KNEW.
4008527 4010794 AND THE GIRL KEPT THIS BAD<br />THING LOCKED IN HER HEART.
4010829 4013430 THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT,<br />WOULDN'T IT?
4013465 4014964 YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

4297749 4299482 YES. I FOUND THAT<br />AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY, TOO,
4299517 4301918 BUT I NEVER WAS<br />MUCH OF A BUSINESSMAN.

4848699 4852301 YOU'D SAY ANYTHING<br />TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.
4854438 4857606 YOU WANT TO FEEL SORRY<br />FOR YOURSELF, DON'T YOU?
4857641 4859575 THERE'S SO MUCH<br />AT STAKE.
4859610 4862011 ALL YOU THINK OF<br />IS YOUR OWN FEELING.
4862046 4863579 ONE WOMAN HAS HURT YOU,
4863614 4866915 AND YOU TAKE YOUR REVENGE<br />ON THE WHOLE WORLD.
4866950 4870820 YOU'RE A COWARD<br />AND A WEAKLING.
4871955 4873756 NO. NO, RICHARD.<br />I'M SORRY.
4873791 4878861 I'M SORRY, BUT YOU<br />ARE OUR LAST HOPE.
4878896 4880029 IF YOU DON'T HELP US,
4880064 4881864 VICTOR LASZLO<br />WILL DIE IN CASABLANCA.
4881899 4885334 WHAT OF IT? I'M GOING<br />TO DIE IN CASABLANCA.
4885369 4888337 IT'S A GOOD SPOT FOR IT.
4893043 4895478 NOW, IF YOU--
4895746 4899581 ALL RIGHT, I TRIED<br />TO REASON WITH YOU.
4899616 4901650 I TRIED EVERYTHING.
4901685 4903352 NOW I WANT<br />THOSE LETTERS.
4903387 4904186 GET THEM FOR ME.
4904221 4907490 I DON'T HAVE TO.<br />I GOT THEM RIGHT HERE.
4908425 4911360 PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.
4911395 4912761 NO.
4912796 4916031 FOR THE LAST TIME,<br />PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.
4916066 4919068 IF LASZLO AND THE CAUSE<br />MEAN SO MUCH,
4919103 4921036 YOU WON'T STOP AT ANYTHING.
4921071 4925808 ALL RIGHT. I'LL<br />MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU.
4926777 4928544 GO AHEAD AND SHOOT.
4928579 4931981 YOU'LL BE<br />DOING ME A FAVOR.
4935819 4937052 RICHARD.
4937087 4939722 I TRIED TO STAY AWAY.
4939757 4943359 I THOUGHT I WOULD<br />NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
4943394 4947330 THAT YOU WERE<br />OUT OF MY LIFE.
4966950 4970386 THE DAY<br />YOU LEFT PARIS...
4970421 4973655 IF YOU KNEW WHAT<br />I WENT THROUGH.
4973690 4976759 IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH<br />I LOVED YOU.
4976794 4981497 HOW MUCH<br />I STILL LOVE YOU.
4994778 4995844 AND THEN?
4995879 4998847 IT WASN'T LONG<br />AFTER WE WERE MARRIED
4998882 5001583 THAT VICTOR WENT BACK<br />TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA.
5001618 5003085 THEY NEEDED HIM<br />IN PRAGUE,
5003120 5005988 BUT THERE THE GESTAPO<br />WERE WAITING FOR HIM.
5006023 5007489 JUST A 2-LINE ITEM<br />IN THE PAPER,
5007524 5008557 "VICTOR LASZLO<br />APPREHENDED.
5008592 5011026 SENT TO<br />CONCENTRATION CAMP."
5011061 5012194 I WAS FRANTIC.
5012229 5015531 FOR MONTHS<br />I TRIED TO GET WORD.
5015566 5016332 THEN IT CAME.
5016367 5019535 HE WAS DEAD--<br />SHOT TRYING TO ESCAPE.
5019570 5021770 I WAS LONELY.<br />I HAD NOTHING--
5021805 5023138 NOT EVEN HOPE.
5023173 5024673 THEN I MET YOU.
5024708 5026508 WHY WEREN'T YOU<br />HONEST WITH ME?
5026543 5029912 WHY DID YOU KEEP<br />YOUR MARRIAGE A SECRET?
5029947 5031013 IT WASN'T MY SECRET.
5031048 5032648 VICTOR WANTED IT<br />THAT WAY.
5032683 5034116 OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS<br />DIDN'T KNOW.
5034151 5037920 HE WANTED TO PROTECT ME.<br />I KNEW ABOUT HIS WORK.
5037955 5040189 IF THE GESTAPO KNEW<br />I WAS HIS WIFE,
5040224 5041557 IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS<br />FOR ME
5041592 5042825 AND FOR THOSE<br />WORKING WITH US.
5042860 5046228 WHEN DID YOU FIRST<br />FIND OUT HE WAS ALIVE?
5046263 5048030 JUST BEFORE YOU AND I
5048065 5049965 WERE TO<br />LEAVE PARIS TOGETHER.
5050000 5052234 A FRIEND TOLD ME<br />VICTOR WAS ALIVE.
5052269 5054236 THEY WERE HIDING HIM<br />IN A FREIGHT CAR
5054271 5056238 ON THE OUTSKIRTS<br />OF PARIS.
5056273 5058207 HE WAS SICK.<br />HE NEEDED ME.
5058242 5061743 I WANTED TO TELL YOU,<br />BUT I DIDN'T DARE.
5061778 5064713 I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T<br />HAVE LEFT PARIS
5064748 5067850 AND THE GESTAPO<br />WOULD HAVE CAUGHT YOU.
5067885 5071821 SO I...WELL,<br />YOU KNOW THE REST.
5073190 5076658 WELL, IT'S STILL<br />A STORY WITHOUT AN ENDING.
5076693 5078794 WHAT ABOUT NOW?
5078829 5080162 NOW?
5080197 5081029 I DON'T KNOW.
5081065 5085067 I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER<br />HAVE THE STRENGTH
5085102 5086902 TO LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
5086937 5088871 AND LASZLO?
5088906 5090105 YOU'LL HELP HIM,<br />WON'T YOU?
5090140 5092274 YOU'LL SEE<br />THAT HE GETS OUT.
5092309 5093842 THEN HE'LL HAVE<br />HIS WORK--
5093877 5096111 ALL THAT HE'S<br />BEEN LIVING FOR.
5096146 5097779 ALL EXCEPT ONE.
5097814 5100916 HE WON'T HAVE YOU.
5102219 5104953 I CAN'T FIGHT IT<br />ANYMORE.
5104988 5107589 I RAN AWAY<br />FROM YOU ONCE.
5107624 5110125 I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.
5110961 5113962 I DON'T KNOW<br />WHAT'S RIGHT ANY LONGER.
5113997 5117165 YOU HAVE TO THINK<br />FOR BOTH OF US,
5117200 5120002 FOR ALL OF US.
5122973 5124273 ALL RIGHT.
5124308 5126509 I WILL.
5128979 5132014 HERE'S LOOKING<br />AT YOU, KID.
5132649 5136652 I WISH I DIDN'T<br />LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
5148165 5149898 I THINK<br />WE LOST THEM.
5149933 5153201 YES. I'M AFRAID THEY CAUGHT<br />SOME OF THE OTHERS.
5153236 5155671 COME INSIDE.<br />COME.
5157341 5159207 COME, MR. LASZLO.
5159242 5162945 I WILL HELP YOU...<br />IMMEDIATELY.
5162980 5164580 THANK YOU.
5166183 5169118 [VOICES]
5182633 5183532 CARL, WHAT HAPPENED?
5183568 5186868 THE POLICE BREAK UP<br />OUR MEETING, HERR RICK.
5186903 5189171 WE ESCAPED<br />IN THE LAST MOMENT.
5189206 5190038 COME UP HERE.
5190074 5193075 TURN OUT THE LIGHT<br />IN THE REAR ENTRANCE.
5193110 5194643 IT MIGHT<br />ATTRACT THE POLICE.
5194678 5196678 SACHA ALWAYS<br />PUTS IT OUT.
5196713 5197913 TONIGHT HE FORGOT.
5197948 5200783 I WILL DO IT.
5206757 5210058 I WANT YOU<br />TO TAKE MISS LUND HOME.
5210093 5211827 YES, SIR.
5221204 5223171 IT'S NOTHING.<br />JUST A LITTLE CUT.
5223206 5225273 WE HAD TO GET<br />THROUGH A WINDOW.
5225308 5227776 THIS MIGHT<br />COME IN HANDY.
5227811 5229111 THANK YOU.
5229146 5231246 HAD A CLOSE ONE, EH?
5231281 5232714 YES, RATHER.
5232749 5236318 DON'T YOU SOMETIMES WONDER<br />IF IT'S WORTH ALL THIS?
5236353 5239154 I MEAN, WHAT<br />YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR.
5239189 5241356 YOU MIGHT AS WELL QUESTION<br />WHY WE BREATHE.
5241391 5243825 IF WE STOP BREATHING,<br />WE'LL DIE.
5243860 5246361 IF WE STOP FIGHTING OUR<br />ENEMIES, THE WORLD WILL DIE.
5246396 5248864 WHAT OF IT? IT'LL BE<br />OUT OF ITS MISERY.
5248899 5249898 YOU KNOW HOW YOU SOUND?
5249934 5253168 LIKE A MAN TRYING TO CONVINCE<br />HIMSELF OF SOMETHING
5253203 5255904 HE DOESN'T BELIEVE<br />IN HIS HEART.
5255939 5259975 EACH OF US HAS A DESTINY--<br />FOR GOOD OR EVIL.
5260010 5261243 I GET THE POINT.
5261278 5262277 I WONDER IF YOU DO.
5262313 5265914 DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING<br />TO ESCAPE FROM YOURSELF?
5265949 5267115 YOU'LL NEVER SUCCEED.
5267150 5269951 YOU SEEM TO KNOW<br />ALL ABOUT MY DESTINY.
5269986 5273855 I KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE<br />ABOUT YOU THAN YOU SUSPECT.
5273890 5277225 I KNOW THAT YOU'RE<br />IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN.
5277260 5278259 IT'S PERHAPS<br />A STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE
5278295 5281363 THAT WE BOTH SHOULD BE<br />IN LOVE WITH THE SAME WOMAN.
5281398 5283899 THE FIRST EVENING<br />I CAME TO THIS CAFE,
5283934 5287202 I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING<br />BETWEEN YOU AND ILSA.
5287237 5291073 SINCE NO ONE'S TO BLAME,<br />I DEMAND NO EXPLANATION.
5291108 5292441 I ASK ONLY ONE THING.
5292476 5295210 YOU WON'T GIVE ME<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.
5295245 5298113 ALL RIGHT, BUT I<br />WANT MY WIFE TO BE SAFE.
5298148 5303018 I ASK YOU TO USE THE LETTERS<br />TO TAKE HER AWAY.
5303053 5304419 YOU LOVE HER<br />THAT MUCH?
5304454 5309024 YOU THINK OF ME<br />ONLY AS A LEADER OF A CAUSE.
5309059 5310992 I'M ALSO A HUMAN BEING.
5311027 5314263 YES, I LOVE HER THAT MUCH.
5319503 5321069 MONSIEUR LASZLO?
5321104 5322070 YES?
5322105 5325173 COME WITH US. WE HAVE<br />A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.
5325208 5326174 ON WHAT CHARGE?
5326209 5328276 CAPTAIN RENAULT WILL<br />DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU LATER.
5328311 5332247 IT SEEMS THAT DESTINY<br />HAS TAKEN A HAND.
5342292 5344526 YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T<br />ANY ACTUAL PROOF.
5344561 5347129 THIS ISN'T GERMANY<br />OR OCCUPIED FRANCE.
5347164 5350098 YOU CAN ONLY FINE HIM<br />AND GIVE HIM 30 DAYS.
5350133 5351533 YOU MIGHT AS WELL<br />LET HIM GO NOW.
5351568 5353168 I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO BE<br />TOO INTERESTED
5353203 5354436 IN WHAT HAPPENS<br />TO LASZLO.
5354471 5355337 IF YOU HELPED HIM<br />ESCAPE--
5355372 5359074 WHY WOULD I STICK<br />MY NECK OUT FOR LASZLO?
5359109 5361243 1--YOU BET 10,000 FRANCS<br />HE'D ESCAPE.
5361278 5363345 2--YOU'VE GOT<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.
5363380 5365113 DON'T BOTHER TO DENY IT.
5365148 5366214 AND YOU MIGHT DO IT
5366249 5368416 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE<br />STRASSER'S LOOKS.
5368451 5369551 AS A MATTER OF FACT,
5369586 5370886 I DON'T LIKE THEM,<br />EITHER.
5370921 5371720 THEY'RE ALL<br />EXCELLENT REASONS.
5371755 5373121 DON'T COUNT TOO MUCH<br />ON MY FRIENDSHIP.
5373156 5375524 IN THIS MATTER,<br />I'M POWERLESS.
5375559 5377325 BESIDES, I MIGHT LOSE<br />THE 10,000 FRANCS.
5377360 5380996 YOU'RE NOT VERY SUBTLE,<br />BUT YOU ARE EFFECTIVE.
5381031 5382064 I GET THE POINT.
5382099 5386201 YES, I HAVE THE LETTERS.<br />I INTEND USING THEM MYSELF.
5386236 5389271 I'M LEAVING CASABLANCA<br />ON THE LAST PLANE TONIGHT.
5389306 5393074 I'M TAKING A FRIEND--<br />ONE YOU'LL APPRECIATE.
5393109 5394109 WHAT FRIEND?
5394144 5395110 ILSA LUND.
5395145 5397546 THAT SHOULD PUT YOUR MIND<br />TO REST ABOUT LASZLO--
5397581 5401316 THE LAST MAN I WANT<br />TO SEE IN AMERICA.
5401351 5403451 YOU DIDN'T COME HERE<br />TO TELL ME THIS.
5403486 5405887 YOU HAVE THE LETTERS<br />OF TRANSIT.
5405922 5407989 YOU CAN LEAVE<br />ANYTIME YOU PLEASE.
5408024 5410125 WHY ARE YOU STILL<br />INTERESTED
5410160 5411393 IN WHAT HAPPENS<br />TO LASZLO?
5411428 5413328 I'M NOT.<br />BUT I AM INTERESTED
5413363 5415831 IN WHAT HAPPENS<br />TO ILSA AND ME.
5415866 5417465 WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT<br />TO GO, THAT'S TRUE,
5417500 5421303 BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELD<br />IN SPITE OF THEIR RIGHTS.
5421338 5423071 WHY SHOULD<br />WE HOLD YOU?
5423106 5424172 ILSA'S LASZLO'S WIFE.
5424207 5428443 SHE PROBABLY KNOWS THINGS<br />STRASSER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
5428478 5429444 I'LL MAKE A DEAL.
5429479 5431947 INSTEAD OF THIS PETTY CHARGE,<br />GET SOMETHING BIG
5431982 5435050 THAT WOULD CHUCK HIM IN<br />A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR YEARS.
5435085 5438119 IT'D BE QUITE A FEATHER<br />IN YOUR CAP, WOULDN'T IT?
5438154 5439254 IT CERTAINLY WOULD.
5439289 5441456 GERMANY--VICHY<br />WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL.
5441491 5442490 THEN RELEASE HIM.
5442526 5445994 BE AT MY PLACE A HALF HOUR<br />BEFORE THE PLANE LEAVES.
5446029 5447229 I'LL HAVE LASZLO COME THERE
5447264 5449231 TO PICK UP<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT--
5449266 5450432 THAT'LL GIVE YOU THE CRIMINAL<br />GROUNDS FOR ARREST.
5450467 5453068 YOU GET HIM,<br />AND WE GET AWAY.
5453103 5456872 TO THE GERMANS, THAT LAST ONE<br />WILL BE JUST A MINOR ANNOYANCE.
5456907 5459641 THERE'S STILL SOMETHING<br />I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.
5459676 5462177 MISS LUND--SHE'S<br />VERY BEAUTIFUL, YES,
5462212 5465247 BUT YOU WERE NEVER<br />INTERESTED IN ANY WOMAN.
5465282 5467182 SHE ISN'T<br />JUST ANY WOMAN.
5467217 5471086 I SEE. HOW DO I KNOW<br />YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD?
5471121 5473255 I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS<br />RIGHT NOW WITH LASZLO
5473290 5474356 IN THE VISITORS' PEN.
5474391 5475624 RICKY,<br />I'LL MISS YOU.
5475659 5476992 YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE<br />IN CASABLANCA
5477027 5479094 WHO HAS EVEN LESS<br />SCRUPLES THAN I.
5479129 5480161 THANKS.
5480196 5481095 GO AHEAD, RICKY.
5481131 5484065 CALL OFF YOUR WATCHDOGS<br />WHEN YOU LET HIM GO.
5484100 5486034 I DON'T WANT THEM AROUND<br />THIS AFTERNOON.
5486069 5489538 I'M TAKING NO CHANCES,<br />NOT EVEN WITH YOU.
5495478 5497045 SHALL WE<br />DRAW UP PAPERS,
5497080 5499114 OR IS A HANDSHAKE<br />GOOD ENOUGH?
5499149 5500282 CERTAINLY<br />NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
5500317 5502517 BUT SINCE I'M IN A<br />HURRY, IT'LL HAVE TO DO.
5502552 5505253 AH, TO LEAVE CASABLANCA<br />AND GO TO AMERICA--
5505288 5506454 YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.
5506489 5509090 BY THE WAY,<br />MY AGREEMENT WITH SAM
5509125 5511459 IS THAT HE GETS<br />25% OF THE PROFITS.
5511494 5514562 I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S 10%,<br />BUT HE'S WORTH 25.
5514597 5517632 ABDUL, CARL, AND SACHA<br />STAY, OR I DON'T SELL.
5517667 5521169 OF COURSE. RICK'S WOULDN'T<br />BE RICK'S WITHOUT THEM.
5521204 5522370 WELL, SO LONG.
5522405 5523972 DON'T FORGET,<br />YOU OWE RICK'S
5524007 5525941 100 CARTONS OF<br />AMERICAN CIGARETTES.
5525976 5530012 I SHALL REMEMBER<br />TO PAY IT TO MYSELF.
5547664 5550499 [BANGING ON DOOR]
5562579 5564045 YOU'RE LATE.
5564080 5564846 I WAS INFORMED
5564881 5566414 JUST AS LASZLO WAS<br />LEAVING THE HOTEL,
5566449 5567582 SO I KNEW<br />I'D BE ON TIME.
5567617 5569417 I ASKED YOU TO TIE UP<br />YOUR WATCHDOGS.
5569452 5570318 HE WON'T BE<br />FOLLOWED HERE.
5570353 5572020 THIS PLACE WON'T BE<br />THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.
5572055 5573555 I KNOW, BUT I'VE ALREADY<br />SPOKEN TO FERRARI.
5573590 5575256 YOU'LL STILL<br />WIN AT ROULETTE.
5575291 5576725 IS EVERYTHING READY?
5576760 5577659 I HAVE<br />THE LETTERS.
5577695 5581096 WHEN WE SEARCHED THE PLACE,<br />WHERE WERE THEY?
5581131 5581930 SAM'S PIANO.
5581965 5584332 SERVES ME RIGHT<br />FOR NOT BEING MUSICAL.
5584367 5585367 [BRAKES SQUEAL]
5585402 5586534 HERE THEY ARE.
5586569 5589504 YOU'D BETTER<br />WAIT IN MY OFFICE.
5597080 5598480 HERE.
5598515 5600715 RICHARD, VICTOR THINKS<br />I'M LEAVING WITH HIM.
5600750 5602384 HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HIM?
5602419 5603251 NO, NOT YET.
5603287 5605520 IT'S ALL RIGHT?<br />YOU ARRANGED EVERYTHING?
5605555 5606554 YES. WE'LL TELL HIM<br />AT THE AIRPORT.
5606590 5609257 THE LESS TIME TO THINK,<br />THE EASIER FOR ALL OF US.
5609292 5610993 PLEASE TRUST ME.
5612529 5615130 YES, I WILL.
5616199 5620135 MONSIEUR BLAINE, I DON'T<br />KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.
5620170 5623638 SAVE IT. WE'VE LOTS<br />OF THINGS TO DO.
5624240 5625440 I BROUGHT<br />THE MONEY.
5625475 5628243 KEEP IT. YOU'LL<br />NEED IT IN AMERICA.
5628278 5629611 BUT WE<br />MADE A DEAL.
5629646 5632580 NEVER MIND. WILL YOU<br />HAVE TROUBLE IN LISBON?
5632615 5633514 NO. IT'S ALL ARRANGED.
5633550 5637085 GOOD. THE LETTERS ARE<br />ALL MADE OUT IN BLANK.
5637120 5639187 JUST FILL IN<br />THE SIGNATURES.
5639222 5640622 VICTOR LASZLO?
5640657 5643792 VICTOR LASZLO,<br />YOU'RE UNDER ARREST...

5775858 5779827 THE NAMES ARE MR.<br />AND MRS. VICTOR LASZLO.
5779862 5780628 WHY MY NAME,<br />RICHARD?
5780663 5782764 BECAUSE YOU'RE<br />GETTING ON THAT PLANE.
5782799 5784465 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.<br />WHAT ABOUT YOU?
5784500 5785833 I'M STAYING HERE<br />WITH HIM
5785868 5787969 TILL THE PLANE<br />GETS SAFELY AWAY.
5788004 5788803 NO, RICHARD.<br />LAST NIGHT--
5788838 5790872 LAST NIGHT WE SAID<br />A GREAT MANY THINGS.
5790907 5793841 YOU SAID I SHOULD<br />THINK FOR BOTH OF US.
5793876 5795577 WELL, I HAVE.<br />IT ALL ADDS UP TO ONE THING.

5801385 5805220 WE'D PROBABLY BOTH WIND UP<br />IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP.
5805255 5806521 ISN'T THAT TRUE, LOUIS?
5806556 5808990 I'M AFRAID MAJOR STRASSER<br />WOULD INSIST.
5809025 5811826 YOU'RE SAYING THIS<br />ONLY TO MAKE ME GO.
5811861 5812760 I'M SAYING IT<br />BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
5812796 5813895 INSIDE, WE BOTH KNOW<br />YOU BELONG WITH VICTOR.
5813930 5815029 YOU'RE PART OF HIS WORK,<br />THE THING THAT KEEPS HIM GOING.
5815064 5819901 IF THAT PLANE LEAVES THE GROUND<br />AND YOU'RE NOT WITH HIM,
5819936 5820702 YOU'LL REGRET IT.
5820737 5822003 MAYBE NOT TODAY,<br />MAYBE NOT TOMORROW,
5822038 5824706 BUT SOON, AND FOR THE REST<br />OF YOUR LIFE.
5824741 5826341 BUT WHAT ABOUT US?
5826376 5829010 WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS.<br />WE DIDN'T HAVE IT.
5829045 5832413 WE'D LOST IT UNTIL YOU CAME<br />TO CASABLANCA.
5832448 5834315 WE GOT IT BACK<br />LAST NIGHT.
5834350 5836951 WHEN I SAID I<br />WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU.
5836986 5839020 AND YOU NEVER WILL,
5839055 5840622 BUT I'VE GOT A JOB<br />TO DO, TOO.
5840657 5841556 WHERE I'M GOING,<br />YOU CAN'T FOLLOW.
5841592 5844892 WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO,<br />YOU CAN'T BE PART OF.
5844927 5847528 I'M NO GOOD<br />AT BEING NOBLE,
5847563 5849364 BUT IT DOESN'T<br />TAKE MUCH TO SEE
5849399 5850965 THAT THE PROBLEMS<br />OF THREE LITTLE PEOPLE
5851000 5854535 DON'T AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANS<br />IN THIS CRAZY WORLD.
5854570 5857872 SOMEDAY YOU'LL<br />UNDERSTAND THAT.

5880730 5882363 THERE'S SOMETHING<br />YOU SHOULD KNOW
5882398 5883164 BEFORE YOU LEAVE.
5883199 5885300 I DON'T ASK YOU<br />TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.
5885335 5886201 I'M GOING TO ANYWAY.
5886236 5887735 BECAUSE IT MAY MAKE<br />A DIFFERENCE LATER ON.
5887770 5890738 YOU SAID YOU KNEW<br />YES. ABOUT ILSA AND ME.
5890773 5893841 YOU DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS<br />AT MY PLACE LAST NIGHT.
5893876 5895677 SHE CAME THERE FOR<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.
5895712 5897545 ISN'T THAT TRUE?
5897580 5898446 YES.
5898481 5900782 SHE TRIED EVERYTHING,<br />AND NOTHING WORKED.
5900817 5903651 SHE DID HER BEST<br />TO CONVINCE ME
5903686 5906087 THAT SHE WAS STILL<br />IN LOVE WITH ME.
5906122 5907955 THAT WAS OVER LONG AGO.<br />FOR YOUR SAKE,
5907990 5910925 SHE PRETENDED IT WASN'T,<br />AND I LET HER PRETEND.
5910960 5913094 I UNDERSTAND.
5913129 5914929 HERE IT IS.
5914964 5917932 THANKS.<br />I APPRECIATE IT.

5919836 5923938 THIS TIME I KNOW<br />OUR SIDE WILL WIN.
5936619 5939020 ARE YOU READY, ILSA?
5940556 5943024 YES, I'M READY.
5946062 5947061 GOODBYE, RICK.
5947096 5949664 GOD BLESS YOU.
5950500 5954536 YOU'D BETTER HURRY<br />OR YOU'LL MISS THAT PLANE.

5979095 5980728 THAT FAIRY TALE<br />YOU INVENTED.
5980763 5981996 I KNOW A LITTLE<br />ABOUT WOMEN.
5982031 5984699 SHE WENT, BUT SHE KNEW<br />YOU WERE LYING.
5984734 5987168 ANYWAY, THANKS<br />FOR HELPING ME OUT.
5987203 5989937 I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW<br />THIS WON'T BE PLEASANT
5989972 5992006 FOR EITHER OF US--<br />ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.
5992041 5993775 I'LL HAVE TO ARREST YOU.
5993810 5996544 AS SOON AS THE PLANE GOES.
6002151 6005052 WHAT WAS THE MEANING<br />OF THAT PHONE CALL?
6005087 6007956 VICTOR LASZLO<br />IS ON THAT PLANE.
6008591 6012627 WHY DO YOU STAND HERE?<br />WHY DON'T YOU STOP HIM?

6015898 6017465 GET AWAY<br />FROM THAT PHONE.
6017500 6018900 I WOULD ADVISE YOU<br />NOT TO INTERFERE.

6079762 6082830 IT SEEMED LIKE<br />A GOOD TIME TO START.
6082865 6085633 I THINK<br />PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

14172744 14175511 <i>NO, IT IS NOT.</i><br /><i>AND IT IS PRECISELY</i><br /><i>THE PURPOSE...</i>
14175546 14178681 OF OUR CONFERENCE<br />TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS<br />INFORMALLY,
14178716 14181851 FAR AWAY<br />FROM THE TO-DO OF A LARGE,<br />INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE.
14181886 14184187 HERE IN THE FRIENDLY<br />AND RELAXED...
14184222 14187957 <i>ATMOSPHERE</i><br /><i>OF ONE'S HOME,</i>
14187992 14191694 <i>WE MAY HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING</i><br /><i>AROUND OTHERS, LIKE THE FRENCH,</i><br /><i>TO OUR POINT OF VIEW.</i>
14191729 14194030 - AND THAT OF THE GERMANS.<br />-<i> [ Darlington ] AND THAT</i><br />OF THE GERMANS.
14194065 14196566 <i>[ Man ] I'M SORRY, SIR.</i><br /><i>I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT,</i><br /><i>BUT I DON'T SEE HOW...</i>
14196601 14199902 <i>WE CAN ASSOCIATE OURSELVES NOW</i><br /><i>WITH THE GERMANS, YOU KNOW,</i><br /><i>WITH THE NAZI PARTY.</i>
14199937 14202905 THEY HAVE ACTUALLY<br />TORN UP AND TRAMPLED ON<br />EVERY SINGLE TREATY...
14202940 14205374 AND SEEM TO BE<br />A WORSE THREAT THAN EVER<br />TO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE,
14205409 14207477 NOT TO MENTION THEIR BRUTAL<br />DICTATORSHIP AT HOME.
14207512 14210046 <i>[ Darlington ]</i><br /><i>MY DEAR BOY,</i><br /><i>WHEN I WAS IN BERLIN,</i>
14210081 14213082 <i>I SAW, AT LAST,</i><br /><i>A HAPPY GERMAN PEOPLE,</i>
14213117 14217720 <i>WITH JOBS AND BREAD</i><br /><i>AND PRIDE IN THEIR COUNTRY</i><br /><i>AND LOVE OF THEIR LEADER.</i>
14217755 14219823 <i>AND WHAT ABOUT THE JEWS?</i>
14226097 14228831 MR. STEVENS,<br />WAS IT HIS LORDSHIP'S WISH...
14228866 14232268 THAT THE CHINAMAN FROM THE<br />CABINET ROOM SHOULD BE EXCHANGED<br />WITH THE ONE OUTSIDE THE DOOR?
14232303 14234237 <i>CHINAMAN?</i><br /><i>YES.</i>
14234272 14237707 THE CHINAMAN<br />FROM THE CABINET ROOM<br />IS NOW OUTSIDE THIS DOOR.
14237742 14241310 - COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.<br />- I'M BUSY AT THE MOMENT.
14241345 14244347 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS POP<br />YOUR HEAD OUTSIDE THIS DOOR<br />AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
14244382 14247416 - IT WON'T TAKE A MOMENT.<br />- I WILL LOOK INTO THE MATTER<br />IN DUE COURSE, MISS KENTON.
14247451 14249519 YOU THINK<br />IT MIGHT BE A FANTASY?
14249554 14252688 A FANTASY ON MY PART,<br />DUE TO MY INEXPERIENCE?
14252723 14256459 I'M BUSY IN THIS ROOM,<br />MISS KENTON.
14256494 14258694 I SHALL WAIT.
14258729 14260663 OUTSIDE.
14322760 14325695 LOOK AT IT!<br />IS THAT OR IS IT NOT<br />THE WRONG CHINAMAN?
14325730 14329632 <i>MISS KENTON, I'M VERY BUSY,</i><br /><i>AND I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU</i><br /><i>HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO...</i>
14329667 14332001 THAN STAND AROUND ALL DAY.<br />MR. STEVENS, LOOK AT THAT<br />CHINAMAN AND TELL ME THE TRUTH!
14332036 14334036 MISS KENTON, I WOULD ASK YOU<br />TO KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
14334071 14337974 WHAT WOULD THE OTHER<br />SERVANTS THINK TO HEAR US<br />SHOUTING ABOUT CHINAMEN?
14338009 14340142 I WOULD ASK YOU,<br />MR. STEVENS,
14340177 14344113 TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK<br />AT THE CHINAMAN.
14349620 14351587 IT IS A SMALL MISTAKE,<br />A TRIVIAL MISTAKE.
14351622 14354557 YOUR FATHER IS ENTRUSTED<br />WITH MORE THAN A MAN<br />OF HIS AGE CAN COPE WITH.
14354592 14356592 I'M CONCERNED FOR HIM.<br />MR. STEVENS.<br />PLEASE LET ME PASS.
14356627 14359962 MR. STEVENS, IT WAS YOUR<br />FATHER WHO LEFT THE DUSTPAN<br />IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.
14359997 14362932 IT IS HE WHO IS LEAVING POLISH<br />ON THE CUTLERY. IT IS HE WHO<br />HAS CONFUSED THE CHINAMEN.
14362967 14365501 YOU MUST RECOGNIZE THIS<br />BEFORE HE COMMITS A MAJOR ERROR.
14365536 14367603 I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME<br />LIKE THIS, MISS KENTON.
14367638 14371941 I'M AFRAID I MUST, MR. STEVENS.<br />I'M GIVING YOU SERIOUS ADVICE.
14371976 14377446 YOUR FATHER SHOULD BE RELIEVED<br />OF A NUMBER OF HIS DUTIES<br />FOR HIS OWN GOOD.
14377481 14382251 WHATEVER YOUR FATHER ONCE WAS,<br />HE NO LONGER HAS THE SAME<br />ABILITY OR STRENGTHS.
14382286 14385621 I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE,<br />MISS KENTON.
14385656 14387823 NOW PERHAPS YOU WILL ALLOW ME<br />TO GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS.
14387858 14390626 OH, I NEVER MEANT TO KEEP YOU<br />FROM YOUR BUSINESS, MR. STEVENS.
14390661 14392729 THANK YOU.
14396167 14401804 IT'S VITAL THAT WE'VE<br />AGREED TO COMMON POLICY<br />BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF, UH--
14401839 14405675 YOUR FRENCHMAN,<br />WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?<br />GISCARD DUPONT D'IVRY.
14405710 14408411 WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING<br />THE AMERICAN DELEGATE,
14408446 14411514 CONGRESSMAN LEWIS,<br />TO ARRIVE ON THE SAME DAY.
14411549 14413616 WHO IS HE,<br />THIS AMERICAN?
14413651 14416252 WELL, HE'S RATHER<br />AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY.
14416287 14419088 HE'S A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN<br />FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
14419123 14422792 SITS ON SOME SORT OF POWERFUL<br />FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.
14422827 14425361 YES, I BELIEVE, HEIR TO ONE<br />OF THOSE AMERICAN FORTUNES.
14425396 14427763 MEAT PACKING?<br />TROLLEY CARS?
14427798 14431934 OR DRY GOODS? [ Laughs ]<br />WHAT ARE DRY GOODS?
14431969 14434737 EVIDENTLY,<br />SOMETHING THAT AMERICANS<br />MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN.
14434772 14439342 <i>[ Darlington ]</i><br /><i>NO, I THINK MR. LEWIS'S FORTUNE</i><br /><i>COMES FROM COSMETICS, ACTUALLY.</i>
14444815 14446749 IT'S OLD<br />MR. STEVENS.
14447818 14450152 GET A CUSHION, QUICKLY!<br />A BLANKET!
14450187 14453522 [ Groaning ]<br /><i>HERE YOU ARE.</i>

14456160 14459829 THERE, THERE.<br />THERE, THERE.<br />AH, MY LORD. SORRY.
14459864 14462131 YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.<br />I'M SORRY.
14462166 14464633 THANK YOU, SIR.<br />I'M SORRY.
14464668 14466969 WHAT HAPPENED?<br />HE TRIPPED OVER<br />WITH THE TRAY.
14467004 14469238 YES, I SAW IT, SIR,<br />FROM THE WINDOW.<br />I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
14469273 14472241 THIS HAS NEVER<br />HAPPENED BEFORE, SIR.<br />MAY I TELEPHONE THE DOCTOR?
14472276 14475277 YES, DO. YES.<br />THANK YOU, SIR.
14475312 14478347 I'M SORRY.<br />I'M SORRY.<br />DON'T WORRY.
14478382 14480316 I'M SORRY, MY LORD.
14483287 14486189 <i>[ Darlington ]</i><br /><i>OH, STEVENS.</i><br /><i>AH, YES, MY LORD.</i>
14490628 14492728 YOUR FATHER<br />FEELING BETTER?
14492763 14496432 YES, HE'S MADE A FULL RECOVERY,<br />I'M HAPPY TO SAY, SIR.<br /><i>GOOD.</i>
14496467 14500770 BUT NONE OF US WISH<br />TO SEE ANYTHING OF THAT SORT<br />EVER HAPPEN AGAIN, DO WE?
14500805 14504273 <i>I MEAN, YOUR FATHER</i><br /><i>COLLAPSING AND ALL THAT.</i><br /><i>INDEED NOT, MY LORD.</i>
14504308 14509645 AND IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE,<br />AT ANY TIME.
14509680 14511781 LOOK HERE, STEVENS. THE FIRST<br />OF THE FOREIGN DELEGATES...
14511816 14514083 WILL BE ARRIVING HERE<br />IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT.
14514118 14517420 YES, WE ARE<br />WELL PREPARED, MY LORD.<br />WELL, I'M SURE YOU ARE.
14517455 14519622 AND WHAT HAPPENS<br />WITHIN THIS HOUSE<br />DURING THE CONFERENCE...
14519657 14523959 COULD HAVE, UH, CONSIDERABLE<br />REPERCUSSIONS ON THE WHOLE<br />COURSE THAT EUROPE IS TAKING.
14523994 14526629 YES, MY LORD.<br />YES, IT MEANS<br />A GREAT DEAL.
14526664 14529832 AND I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU,<br />STEVENS, IT MEANS A GREAT<br />DEAL TO ME, PERSONALLY.
14529867 14534570 I HAD A GERMAN FRIEND,<br />KARL-HEINZ BREMANN.
14534605 14537740 WE FOUGHT ON OPPOSITE SIDES<br />IN THE WAR.
14537775 14539742 WE ALWAYS SAID WHEN THIS<br />WRETCHED BUSINESS IS OVER,
14539777 14545081 WE'LL SIT DOWN AND HAVE<br />A DRINK TOGETHER,<br />LIKE GENTLEMEN.
14545116 14548417 THE VERSAILLES TREATY<br />MADE A LIAR OF ME.
14548452 14551253 YES, A LIAR, STEVENS.
14551288 14553589 BECAUSE THE TERMS THAT WE,<br />THE VICTOR, IMPOSED...
14553624 14555791 WERE SO HARSH, THAT GERMANY<br />WAS SIMPLY FINISHED.
14555826 14558761 WELL, ONE DOESN'T DO THAT<br />TO A DEFEATED FOE.
14558796 14562131 NO, ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR<br />MAN ON THE CANVAS, THAT<br />OUGHT TO BE THE END OF IT.
14562166 14567269 MY FRIEND BREMANN WAS, UH,<br />RUINED BY INFLATION.
14567304 14571107 COULDN'T GET A JOB<br />IN POSTWAR GERMANY.
14571142 14573776 KILLED HIMSELF.
14573811 14577613 SHOT HIMSELF...<br />IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE<br />BETWEEN HAMBURG AND BERLIN.
14577648 14581450 <i>WELL, EVER SINCE THAT TIME,</i><br /><i>I FELT IT MY DUTY, MY JOB,</i><br /><i>STEVENS,</i>
14581485 14584653 <i>TO HOLD OUT</i><br /><i>A HELPING HAND TO GERMANY,</i><br /><i>GIVE HER A FAIR CHANCE.</i>
14584688 14587123 SO, YOU SEE, STEVENS,<br />THIS CONFERENCE IS CRUCIAL,
14587158 14590726 AND WE REALLY CAN'T RUN<br />THE RISK OF ANY ACCIDENTS.
14590761 14593129 LOOK HERE.<br />IT ISN'T A QUESTION<br />OF YOUR FATHER LEAVING US.
14593164 14596398 <i>YOU'RE SIMPLY BEING ASKED</i><br /><i>TO RECONSIDER HIS DUTIES.</i>
14596433 14599401 OF COURSE, MY LORD.<br />I UNDERSTAND FULLY.
14599436 14601570 GOOD.
14601605 14604573 WELL, I'LL LEAVE YOU<br />TO THINK ABOUT IT THEN.
14604608 14606509 THANK YOU, SIR.

14709313 14712615 WELL, TALK THEN.<br />I HAVEN'T GOT ALL MORNING.
14712650 14716285 I'LL COME STRAIGHT<br />TO THE POINT.<br />DO, AND BE DONE WITH IT.

14726163 14730132 PEOPLE OF GREAT STATURE<br />WILL BE HIS LORDSHIP'S GUESTS.
14730167 14733802 WE MUST ALL PUT<br />OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD.
14733837 14737139 BECAUSE OF FATHER'S<br />RECENT ACCIDENT,
14737174 14741176 IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED<br />THAT YOU NO LONGER<br />WAIT AT TABLE.
14741211 14745481 I'VE--
14745516 14748984 I'VE WAITED AT TABLE<br />EVERY DAY...
14749019 14751854 FOR THE LAST 54 YEARS.
14753857 14757726 IT HAS ALSO BEEN DECIDED<br />THAT YOU SHOULD NO LONGER<br />CARRY HEAVY TRAYS.

14774144 14777980 YOU WILL READ THE REVISED LIST<br />OF YOUR DUTIES, FATHER.

14788992 14790926 NO, INDEED, I DON'T.
14807177 14812648 - MR. STEVENS.<br />- WHAT IS IT?
14836140 14839441 NOW, YOU HAVE<br />WHAT WE CAN CALL<br />A ROVING COMMISSION.
14839476 14843112 IN OTHER WORDS,<br />YOU MAY EXERCISE<br />YOUR OWN JUDGMENT,
14843147 14845781 BUT WITHIN CERTAIN<br />LIMITS, OF COURSE.

14871508 14873976 I'LL GIVE THEM<br />A GOOD GOING-OVER<br />WITH THIS MOP.
14874011 14875978 THAT'S RIGHT.<br />YES.

15027130 15029264 WAS MY CLOSEST FRIEND,<br />AS YOU KNOW.

15035138 15038440 I'VE APPOINTED HIM AS MY<br />SECRETARY AT THE CONFERENCE,<br />AS I'VE SAID.
15038475 15042411 AND SO FAR<br />HE'S BEEN JOLLY THOROUGH<br />IN HELPING ME TO PREPARE.
15049119 15054690 STEVENS, I REALIZE THIS IS<br />A SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR THING<br />TO ASK YOU TO DO.

15079616 15081750 I'M SO FRIGHTFULLY BUSY<br />WITH THIS CONFERENCE.
15081785 15086321 OF COURSE,<br />YOU'RE VERY BUSY TOO, BUT...<br />SOMEONE HAS TO TELL HIM.
15086356 15089758 IN A WAY, IT WOULD BE<br />EASIER FOR YOU.
15089793 15091760 LESS AWKWARD.

15094631 15098433 I MIGHT NOT GET AROUND TO IT<br />BEFORE REGINALD'S WEDDING DAY.
15098468 15103438 OF COURSE, THIS GOES FAR BEYOND<br />THE CALL OF DUTY, STEVENS.

17914915 17919218 BUT THERE WAS ROOM<br />ONLY FOR ONE, AND THE GIRLS<br />DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEPARATED.
17919253 17921487 WELL, TRY ANYWAY,<br />STEVENS.

21015044 21017145 any criminal cases,<br />not any more.
21017180 21018480 Your doctors have...<br />Doctors!
21018515 21020315 They've deprived me<br />of everything,
21020350 21022484 alcohol, tobacco,<br />female companionship.
21022519 21023885 If only they'd let me<br />function at my work
21023920 21025353 on something worthwhile.
21025388 21027355 Sorry, Sir Wilfrid.
21027390 21028823 Might as well get<br />a bigger box,<br />more mothballs,
21028858 21030325 put me away, too.
21030360 21032527 2:30, Sir Wilfrid.<br />Time for our little nap.
21032562 21034028 WILFRID: Oh, get out!
21034063 21035864 And beddy-bye.
21035899 21038400 We'd better go upstairs now,<br />get undressed and lie down.
21038435 21040835 We? What a nauseating<br />prospect!
21040870 21042837 Upstairs, please.
21042872 21045173 Are you aware,<br />Miss Plimsoll,<br />while on my sickbed,
21045208 21047876 I seriously considered<br />strangling you
21047911 21050678 with one of your own<br />rubber tubes?
21050713 21052180 I would then have<br />admitted the crime,
21052215 21054082 retained myself<br />for the defense.
21056619 21059354 My lord and members<br />of the jury,
21059389 21063024 I hereby enter a plea<br />of justifiable homicide.
21063059 21065059 For four months,<br />this alleged angel of mercy
21065094 21069764 has pawed, probed,<br />punctured,
21069799 21072600 pillaged and plundered<br />my helpless body,
21072635 21076538 while tormenting my mind<br />with a steady drip<br />of baby talk.
21076573 21079541 Come along, now,<br />like a good boy. Oh, no!
21079576 21080942 You take your hands off me,<br />Miss Plimsoll,
21080977 21082444 or I'll strike you<br />with my cane.
21082479 21084446 Oh, you'd never do that.
21084481 21086047 You might break<br />your cigars.<br />Cigars? What cigars?
21086082 21087882 The ones you're smuggling<br />in your cane.
21087917 21088817 Cane?
21096593 21100061 You could be jailed for this.<br />You had no search warrant<br />for my cane.
21100096 21103064 In hospital,<br />he'd hide cigars and brandy<br />all over the place.
21103099 21105800 We called him<br />Wilfrid the fox.
21105835 21108236 I'm confiscating these.
21108271 21110238 Can't I have just one?
21110273 21111940 No! Upstairs!
21113776 21116111 A few puffs after meals?<br />Please!
21117514 21120148 Well, I'll do it!
21120183 21122450 Some dark night<br />when her back is turned,<br />I'll snatch her thermometer
21122485 21124152 and plunge it between<br />her shoulder blades.
21124187 21126254 So help me, I will!
21126289 21128423 Oh, no, sir,<br />you mustn't walk up.
21128458 21130625 We've installed<br />something for you here.
21131661 21133428 It's a lift, sir.
21133463 21135597 A lift?<br />I'm getting sick<br />of this plot
21135632 21137098 to make me<br />a helpless invalid.
21137133 21139100 I think it's<br />a splendid idea.
21139135 21141002 Let's try it,<br />shall we?
21141037 21142971 Out of there.<br />I'll try it.
21143006 21145807 It's my lift,<br />because it was<br />my heart attack.
21145842 21147675 Here you are.
21147710 21150111 Simply press<br />this button for up,<br />and this one for down.
21150146 21153515 Carter, I warn you,<br />if this contraption<br />should collapse...
21153550 21156218 If the barrister<br />should fall off<br />the banister...
21164661 21166628 This is remarkable, Carter.
21166663 21169197 Smoothest flight<br />I've had in years.<br />Upsy-daisy.
21169232 21171333 Once more,<br />to get the feel<br />of the controls.
21186349 21187815 Good afternoon,<br />Carter.
21187850 21190018 Would it be possible<br />to see Sir Wilfrid?
21190053 21192320 I'm sorry I didn't ring up<br />for an appointment,<br />but this is urgent.
21192355 21194155 If it's about a brief,<br />Mr. Mayhew,
21194190 21195390 I'm sorry,<br />but we're full up.
21195425 21197358 Sir Wilfrid has all<br />that he can handle.
21197393 21199661 I'm sure he'll want<br />this brief.
21199696 21201229 Serious criminal matter.
21204233 21205900 Absolutely not,<br />Mr. Mayhew.
21205935 21207869 Sir Wilfrid<br />is still convalescent.
21207904 21209337 He can't possibly<br />accept anything
21209372 21211573 of an over-stimulating<br />nature.
21211608 21214342 They've put me on a diet<br />of bland civil suits.<br />Hello, Mayhew.
21214377 21217045 Hello, Wilfrid.<br />This is very distressing news<br />about your health.
21217080 21219047 Distressing?<br />It's tragic.
21219082 21220915 You better get yourself<br />a younger man<br />with younger arteries.
21220950 21223084 If you could just<br />give us a few minutes,<br />my client is here.
21223119 21225086 This is Mr. Leonard Vole.
21225121 21227021 He's in rather<br />a ghastly mess,<br />I'm afraid.
21227056 21229390 How do you do,<br />Mr. Vole?
21229425 21231859 Huh! Well, according<br />to Mr. Mayhew,
21231894 21233928 I--I'm not doing<br />at all well.
21233963 21236264 PLIMSOLL: Sir Wilfrid!<br />Sir Wilfrid!
21236299 21238232 You're dawdling again.
21238267 21239434 Oh, shut up!
21239469 21242036 Sorry, Mayhew.
21242071 21244272 Try me again some day<br />when you've something<br />not too stimulating,
21244307 21246608 like a postman<br />bitten by a stray dog.
21253249 21256050 Well, I wish you could<br />help us, Wilfrid,<br />but I quite understand.
21256085 21257619 Take care of yourself.
21259489 21262757 Mayhew! Mayhew!
21262792 21265760 CARTER: Oh, no.<br />Sir Wilfrid, please.
21265795 21267428 Don't worry, Carter,<br />we won't take the brief,
21267463 21269731 but Mr. Mayhew's an old friend<br />and he needs help.
21269766 21271899 Surely I can give him<br />a word of advice.
21271934 21274469 C-Come on, Mayhew,<br />I'll give you five minutes.
21274504 21276437 No, no, no, I don't want you,<br />just Mayhew.
21276472 21277739 Our nap!
21277774 21279240 Sir Wilfrid,<br />our nap!
21279275 21281643 You go ahead.<br />Start it without me.
21283279 21284612 This is your fault,<br />Mr. Carter.
21284647 21286080 You should not<br />have permitted it.
21286115 21288082 It is not<br />my fault.
21288117 21290118 I distinctly<br />told Sir Wilfrid,<br />"No criminal cases."
21290153 21292820 Well, if it's anyone's fault,<br />I expect it's mine.
21292855 21294989 Seems silly to me,<br />but Mr. Mayhew thinks<br />it's very urgent.
21295024 21297425 He, uh, he thinks I may<br />be arrested at any minute.
21297460 21299761 Arrested for what?
21299796 21301929 Well, for murder.
21301964 21304098 Oh.
21304133 21305767 It's the case<br />of Mrs. Emily French.
21305802 21307835 You've probably<br />seen the reports<br />in the press.
21307870 21310004 She was a middle-aged widow,<br />rather well-off,
21310039 21311806 living with a housekeeper<br />at Hampstead.
21311841 21314442 Mr. Vole had been<br />with her earlier<br />in the evening.
21314477 21317278 When the housekeeper<br />returned from her day off,<br />she found her mistress dead,
21317313 21319313 struck on the back<br />of the head and killed.<br />I see.
21319348 21320948 Vole seems a harmless chap
21320983 21322617 caught in a web<br />of circumstantial evidence.
21322652 21324619 Perhaps if I were to give you<br />some more of the details,
21324654 21327121 you might suggest<br />the strongest line of defense.
21327156 21329323 I'd probably think<br />better if you gave me<br />one of those cigars.
21329358 21330958 Of course.
21330993 21333461 There are no previous<br />convictions, naturally.
21333496 21335963 He's a man of good character<br />with an excellent war record.<br />You'd like him a lot.
21335998 21337298 They've confiscated<br />the matches, too.
21337333 21339300 A light, please.<br />Give me a light.
21339335 21340968 As I see it,<br />the defense may turn
21341003 21343504 on establishing an alibi<br />for the night of the murder.
21343539 21345306 I'm sorry,<br />I haven't got any matches.<br />Let me get you some.
21345341 21348209 Lord, no.<br />You don't know<br />Miss Plimsoll.
21348244 21350512 This will take<br />all our cunning.
21355852 21360021 Young man,<br />you come here, please.
21360056 21363024 Uh, your solicitor and I<br />feel you may be able<br />to enlighten me
21363059 21364559 on a rather<br />important point.
21364594 21366327 Why, yes.<br />Thank you.<br />Really, Sir Wilfrid!
21366362 21369698 You're not in bed yet?<br />Upstairs!
21372735 21374068 Give me a match.
21374103 21375503 I'm sorry.<br />I never carry them.
21375538 21377071 What? You said<br />I'd like him.
21377106 21378539 But I do have<br />a lighter.
21378574 21380408 You're quite right, Mayhew,<br />I do like him.
21380443 21382844 Thank you.
21382879 21386914 Can you imagine<br />Miss Plimsoll's face<br />if she saw me now?
21386949 21389718 Then let's make<br />absolutely sure<br />that she doesn't.
21391220 21393187 Splendid.
21393222 21395356 With all the instincts<br />of a skilled criminal.
21395391 21396891 Thank you, sir.<br />Here.
21403065 21405733 Young man, you may<br />or may not have murdered<br />a middle-aged widow,
21405768 21408703 but you've certainly<br />saved the life<br />of an elderly barrister.
21408738 21411572 (LAUGHING) I haven't<br />murdered anybody.<br />It's absurd.
21411607 21413875 Christine, that's my wife,
21413910 21415877 she thought<br />I may be implicated,<br />and that I needed a lawyer.
21415912 21417745 That's why I went<br />to see Mr. Mayhew.
21417780 21419213 Now he thinks<br />he needs a lawyer,
21419248 21420748 and now I have two lawyers.
21420783 21422583 It's rather silly,<br />don't you...
21422618 21424886 Mr. Vole, I am a solicitor,<br />Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.
21424921 21427555 Only a barrister<br />can actually plead<br />a case in court.
21427590 21428923 LEONARD: Oh, I see.
21428958 21431092 She shall not even<br />find the ashes.
21434263 21435596 Sit down.
21435631 21438232 Oh, thank you.
21438267 21440434 Well, I saw in the paper<br />that poor Mrs. French<br />had been found dead
21440469 21441903 with her head bashed in.
21441938 21443471 And it also said<br />in the papers
21443506 21445106 that the police were anxious<br />to interview me,
21445141 21447074 since I'd visited Mrs. French<br />that evening, so...
21447109 21448810 Well, naturally I went along<br />to the police station.
21448845 21450244 Did they caution you?
21450279 21451479 (SIGHS)
21451514 21453581 I--I don't quite know.<br />They...
21453616 21454749 They asked me<br />if I'd like to make<br />a statement,
21454784 21456450 and said that they'd<br />write it down,
21456485 21457618 and that it might be used<br />against me in court.
21457653 21459253 Would that be cautioning me?
21459288 21461823 Oh, well, it can't<br />be helped now.
21461858 21463925 Well, they were very polite<br />and they seemed<br />quite satisfied.
21463960 21466160 They seemed satisfied,<br />Mr. Vole.
21466195 21468629 He thinks that he made<br />a statement and that's<br />the end of it.
21468664 21470264 Isn't it obvious<br />to you, Mr. Vole,
21470299 21471599 that you will be regarded<br />as the principal
21471634 21473434 and logical suspect<br />in this case?
21473469 21474769 I'm very much afraid<br />you'll be arrested.
21474804 21476137 But I've done nothing!
21476172 21477605 Why should I be arrested?
21477640 21479774 I mean, this is England,
21479809 21482276 you don't get arrested<br />or convicted for something<br />you haven't done!
21482311 21485313 We try not to make<br />a habit of it.
21485348 21487649 But it does happen<br />though, doesn't it?
21488317 21490518 Of course.
21490553 21491652 There was the case<br />of that fellow,<br />what's his name,
21491687 21493120 Adolph Beck or Becker.
21493155 21494989 He'd been in jail<br />for eight years,
21495024 21496624 and they suddenly found<br />it was another chap,<br />altogether.
21496659 21498626 He'd been innocent<br />all along.
21498661 21500461 Very unfortunate,<br />but restitution<br />has been made.
21500496 21502964 He received a free pardon,<br />a bounty from the Crown,
21502999 21504799 and was restored<br />to his normal life.
21504834 21506000 LEONARD: Yes,<br />that's all right for him.
21506035 21507368 But what if it had<br />been murder?
21507403 21509670 What if he'd been hanged?
21509705 21512206 How would they have<br />restored him<br />to his normal life then, huh?
21512241 21516177 Mr. Vole, you must not take<br />such a morbid point of view.
21516212 21518045 I'm sorry.<br />It's just when you tell me
21518080 21520982 that all these things<br />are closing in on me,<br />it's like a nightmare.
21521017 21523484 Relax, Mr. Vole.<br />I'm putting you<br />in the hands of the finest
21523519 21525519 and most experienced<br />barrister in London.
21525554 21527488 Now, Mayhew,<br />let's get this straight.
21527523 21529523 I may have done<br />something highly unethical.
21529558 21531492 I've taken your cigar<br />and I'm not taking your case.
21531527 21532827 I can't.
21532862 21534161 I'm forbidden.
21534196 21536330 My doctors would<br />never allow it.
21536365 21538733 I'm truly sorry,<br />young man.
21538768 21541569 However, if you'd like<br />the case handled<br />by someone in these chambers,
21541604 21543537 I'd recommend<br />Mr. Brogan-Moore.<br />You know Brogan-Moore.
21543572 21545373 Yes, I do,<br />a very able man.
21545408 21547208 I second Sir Wilfrid's<br />recommendation.
21547243 21549377 All right, sir,<br />if you say so.
21553883 21555383 Hold this.
21559088 21560521 Carter?<br />Yes, sir?
21560556 21562523 I would like to see<br />Brogan-Moore here,
21562558 21565026 as soon as he comes in<br />from court.<br />Very well.
21565061 21567862 Sir Wilfrid,<br />I have never known<br />such insubordination.
21567897 21570264 No, not even when I was<br />a nurse in the front lines<br />during the war.
21570299 21571532 What war was that?
21571567 21573534 The Crimean War,<br />no doubt.
21573569 21576103 (DOOR SLAMMING)
21576138 21578706 You'll like Brogan-Moore.<br />He's had excellent training,<br />under me.
21578741 21580541 This morning I had<br />no lawyers at all.
21580576 21582443 And now, suddenly,<br />I have three lawyers.
21582478 21584111 Perhaps we should<br />explain to Sir Wilfrid
21584146 21586080 that I have very<br />little money.
21586115 21588282 I shan't be able<br />to pay all the costs<br />and fees.
21588317 21590451 Don't worry,<br />we will get a fourth<br />lawyer to sue you.
21590486 21592253 Well, you won't get<br />very much, I'm afraid.
21592288 21593721 I haven't had a job<br />in four months.
21593756 21595456 What sort of work<br />do you do?
21595491 21598092 Well, uh...
21598127 21600561 My last job was as<br />a mechanic with a--<br />with a motor servicing firm.
21600596 21602563 The--The foreman<br />kept riding me all the time.
21602598 21604565 I took it as long as I could,<br />and then I--I quit.
21604600 21606233 WILFRID: And before that?
21606268 21608269 I worked in a department store<br />in toys,
21608304 21610571 uh, demonstrating<br />children's building sets.
21610606 21612773 Of course,<br />that lasted only during<br />the Christmas rush.
21612808 21615476 And before that,<br />I had a job<br />testing electric blankets.
21615511 21617945 Electric blankets?
21617980 21620748 I suppose you're<br />thinking I'm a bit<br />of a drifter, sir.
21620783 21623250 Well, it's true<br />in a way, but I'm--<br />I'm really not like that.
21623285 21626153 Doing my army service<br />unsettled me a bit.<br />That and living abroad.
21626188 21628923 I was stationed in Germany.<br />It was fine there, though.
21628958 21630491 That's where I met Christine,<br />my wife.
21630526 21633160 She was an actress,<br />and a good one.
21633195 21635596 Ah, she's a wonderful wife<br />to me, too,
21635631 21638432 but I haven't been<br />much of a provider,<br />I'm afraid.
21638467 21640935 Somehow or other,<br />I--I just don't seem to be<br />able to settle down
21640970 21643104 now that I've come back<br />to this country.
21643139 21645106 Of course, if--if<br />I could just put<br />my eggbeater across...
21645141 21647641 Eggbeater?
21647676 21650811 (LAUGHING) Yes, sir. I, ah,<br />I'm a bit of an inventor.
21650846 21654348 Nothing big,<br />just little household things,<br />pocket pencil sharpeners,
21654383 21656283 key-chain flashlights<br />and that sort of thing.
21656318 21657785 But my best is really<br />this eggbeater.
21657820 21660287 You see, it not only<br />beats the egg,
21660322 21662490 but it also separates<br />the yolk from the white.
21662525 21664959 Is that really desirable?
21664994 21667328 LEONARD: If you were<br />a housewife, Sir Wilfrid,<br />you'd see it right away.
21667363 21668796 The only trouble is<br />that I need money
21668831 21670631 for manufacturing<br />and promotion.
21670666 21672466 I was really hoping<br />that that's what Mrs. French
21672501 21675136 might do for me<br />after I met her.<br />Oh.
21675171 21678339 Exactly how did you meet<br />this Mrs. French?
21678374 21680207 Well, that's rather funny<br />in itself.
21680242 21682343 It was the third of September
21682378 21684512 I remember distinctly<br />because it's my<br />wife's birthday.
21684547 21687481 I was window-shopping<br />on Oxford Street,<br />just sort of...
21687516 21690685 <i>Daydreaming about</i><br /><i>what I'd buy for her,</i><br /><i>if I had any money.</i>
21693055 21694589 (POLICE WHISTLE BLOWING)
21739068 21741368 You really like<br />this one?<br />Oh, very much.
21741403 21743370 You don't think<br />it's too, uh, mad?
21743405 21744872 Mad? Not at all.
21744907 21746607 A little daring,<br />perhaps.
21746642 21748709 I wouldn't recommend it<br />to every woman.
21748744 21750444 But you,<br />why shouldn't you attract<br />some attention?
21750479 21752613 Oh, you really<br />think so?
21752648 21755583 Absolutely. But if I could<br />suggest one little thing.<br />Yes?
21755618 21758285 Perhaps we could tip it<br />and bring it back<br />a bit like that.
21758320 21761122 Show more of your face.<br />There.
21761157 21763091 Oh, my bus.<br />Goodbye.<br />Oh, good...
21764927 21766828 You buy that hat.<br />I insist.
21768097 21769630 <i>LEONARD: Actually, it was a...</i>
21769665 21771098 A ridiculous sort of hat.
21771133 21773634 A silly thing with ribbons<br />and flowers.
21773669 21776737 I'm constantly surprised<br />that women's hats<br />do not provoke more murders.
21776772 21779140 (COUGHING) Go on, please.
21779175 21782109 Well, I was only trying<br />to be nice to her,<br />to make her feel good.
21782144 21784411 I never dreamed<br />that I'd see her again,<br />or the hat.
21784446 21785446 But you did?
21785481 21786614 Yes, a few weeks later.
21786649 21788649 Again, quite by accident.
21788684 21790751 I was peddling<br />my eggbeaters<br />that afternoon
21790786 21792620 and business<br />was a little slow...
21795024 21797458 <i>(GUNS FIRING)</i>
21815978 21818946 Would you mind, madam.<br />Your hat!
21818981 21821782 Oh, it's you!<br />Hello!
21821817 21824952 It's your fault, you know,<br />you chose it yourself.
21824987 21827454 May I?<br />Sure, if you like.
21827489 21829490 <i>(GUNS FIRING)</i>
21831493 21833460 Thank you.<br />It's such a bother<br />taking it off
21833495 21835696 and putting it<br />back on again.
21835731 21838632 That chap on the white horse<br />is called Jesse James.
21838667 21841635 Those others have led him<br />into this ambush.<br />It's not at all cricket.
21841670 21844138 Don't worry, Mr. James<br />shoots his way out.<br />Oh, he does?
21844173 21846373 I've seen it before.<br />I go to the movies<br />quite a lot.
21846408 21849176 You do?<br />Oh, I get so restless at home,<br />so I go out,
21849211 21852479 and then I find<br />I've really no place to go,<br />so I go to the movies.
21852514 21855149 Sometimes I see the same one<br />two or three times.
21855184 21856350 Ooh!
21856385 21857484 Toffee?
21857519 21859220 Oh, yes, please.
21859255 21860988 At this time<br />you had no idea
21861023 21862523 that Mrs. French<br />was well-off?
21862558 21864158 No, no,<br />absolutely not.
21864193 21865859 We were sitting<br />in the cheap seats.
21865894 21867895 All I knew was<br />that she seemed<br />to be very lonely,
21867930 21869663 had no friends<br />whatsoever.
21869698 21871031 She and her husband<br />had lived abroad
21871066 21872833 for many years,<br />in British Nigeria.
21872868 21875502 He was in<br />the colonial service.<br />He died in '45,
21875537 21877071 of a heart attack.
21877106 21879406 Please, Mayhew,<br />not while I'm smoking.
21879441 21881909 Go on, young man.
21881944 21885379 Well, they finally<br />polished off Jesse James,<br />and after we left the movie,
21885414 21887848 she invited me<br />to her house for tea.
21887883 21889183 (EMILY LAUGHING)
21889218 21891352 Oh!
21891387 21894054 I think it's the most<br />fascinating thing<br />I've ever seen.
21894089 21895689 Janet, come<br />and look at this!
21895724 21897358 I've seen eggbeaters<br />before, ma'am.
21897393 21898592 Oh, but this beats<br />so quickly
21898627 21900561 and it separates, too.
21900596 21902229 Ah, ah, it must<br />be centrifucal.
21902264 21904398 Or centrifugal,<br />which is it?
21904433 21906734 Actually,<br />it's specific gravity,<br />but it whips cream, too.
21906769 21909069 Oh, did you hear<br />that, Janet?<br />It whips cream, too.
21909104 21911071 Ah!<br />We must have one.
21911106 21913407 Is it expensive?
21913442 21915376 Compliments<br />of the inventor, manufacturer<br />and sole distributor.
21915411 21917211 Oh, thank you.
21917246 21919747 We'll use it constantly.<br />Won't we, Janet?
21919782 21921215 Uh, come, Mr. Vole.
21921250 21922783 We'd better<br />get out of here.
21922818 21925719 Janet doesn't like visitors<br />in her kitchen.
21925754 21926754 (GIGGLING)
21931627 21932760 Hah!
21935264 21937398 Oh, it's a bit chilly<br />in here, isn't it?
21937433 21938899 Shall we have a fire?
21938934 21941068 Why not?
21941103 21944071 Now, this is<br />a charming room.
21944106 21945639 Hubert and I collected<br />all these things
21945674 21947408 when we lived<br />in Africa.
21947443 21949810 (SIGHS) Hubert was<br />my husband.
21951647 21954815 Well, now,<br />there's a lovable chap.
21954850 21957318 That's the mask<br />of the witch doctor.
21957353 21959920 He always wore it<br />when he pulled<br />our servants' teeth,
21959955 21963257 so Hubert used to call him<br />a witch dentist.
21963292 21964591 (LAUGHS)
21964626 21966160 Hubert was so witty.
21966195 21967628 Yes, I can see that.
21967663 21969463 Oh, here's tea.
21972701 21975602 Janet, let's use our good<br />silver and china.
21975637 21977338 (SIGHS)<br />Oh, no, don't bother,<br />Mrs. French,
21977373 21978939 this is perfectly<br />all right.
21978974 21980641 Lemon or milk, please?
21980676 21982676 Oh, I don't really care.
21982711 21984278 Would you prefer<br />some sherry?<br />Sherry would be fine.
21984313 21985679 We've not got any sherry.
21985714 21987147 Oh, but we have.<br />There's that bottle,
21987182 21989817 the one we bought<br />last Christmas.
21989852 21992286 If you care<br />for an eggnog,
21992321 21994788 there happens to be<br />a wasted egg in the kitchen,<br />all ready and separated.
21994823 21997658 Do sit down.<br />And don't mind Janet,<br />Mr. Vole.
21997693 21999793 It's just that<br />she's terribly Scotch.
21999828 22001295 Oh, is she?
22001330 22002663 I thought she came<br />with the collection.
22002698 22004998 (LAUGHS)
22005033 22008802 You know,<br />maybe I'll take a glass<br />of sherry myself.
22008837 22011004 I feel like Christmas,<br />somehow.
22011039 22013374 (GIGGLES)
22013409 22015309 <i>LEONARD: After that,</i><br /><i>I used to see her</i><br /><i>once or twice a week.</i>
22015344 22017378 She always kept a bottle<br />of sherry for me.
22017413 22019813 We'd talk a bit,<br />play canasta,
22019848 22023317 listen to her old<br />gramophone records,<br />Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.
22023352 22024651 It's so weird to think<br />of her now
22024686 22027488 lying in that living room,<br />murdered.
22027523 22029823 I assure you<br />she's been moved by now.
22029858 22033361 To leave her around<br />would be unfeeling,<br />unlawful and unsanitary.
22036865 22040234 MAYHEW: Suppose you tell<br />Sir Wilfrid about the evening<br />of the murder.
22040269 22043170 Well, I went around<br />to see her about 8:00<br />that evening.
22043205 22046039 She fixed me a sandwich,<br />we talked a bit,<br />listened to <i>The Mikado.</i>
22046074 22047574 I left about 9:00.
22047609 22050344 I walked home.<br />I got there about half-past.
22050379 22052546 I can prove that,<br />I can swear to it<br />in or out of court,
22052581 22054515 in the witness box,<br />anywhere.
22054550 22056049 How much money<br />did you get from her?
22056084 22057551 From whom?<br />From Mrs. French.
22057586 22059586 Nothing, not a quid.<br />The truth. How much?
22059621 22061021 Why should she give me<br />any money?
22061056 22063190 Because she was<br />in love with you.
22063225 22065526 That's ridiculous.<br />She liked me.
22065561 22068695 She--She pampered me<br />like--like an aunt.<br />But that's all, I swear!
22068730 22070531 Why didn't you tell her<br />you were a married man?
22070566 22072866 I did tell her.
22072901 22073901 But you never took<br />your wife along<br />when you went there, did you?
22073936 22075102 No, I didn't.<br />Why not?
22075137 22077037 Well, because...<br />Because what?
22077072 22078705 Because Mrs. French<br />was under the impression
22078740 22080874 Christine and I didn't<br />get along too well.
22080909 22083076 Is that true?<br />No, we love each other!
22083111 22085712 Then how did she get<br />that impression?<br />Did you give it to her?
22085747 22087548 No, she just seemed<br />to want to believe it<br />that way.
22087583 22089283 But you never corrected<br />that impression? Why?
22089318 22091285 Well, I was afraid<br />she'd lose interest in me.
22091320 22092886 Because she was rich?<br />Yes, I suppose so.
22092921 22094455 And you were after<br />her money.
22094490 22097224 Well, yes, in a way.
22097259 22100227 I was hoping for a loan<br />for my new invention.
22100262 22102229 Just a couple<br />of hundred pounds.
22102264 22103730 An honest business<br />proposition,
22103765 22105933 that's all it would have been.<br />Is that so wicked?
22105968 22108936 You knew it was<br />the housekeeper's day off?<br />Well, yes, I did.
22108971 22111238 So you went there<br />because you knew<br />she'd be alone?
22111273 22113941 No, I went there<br />because I thought<br />she might be lonely.
22113976 22115742 All right, lonely.<br />You and the rich,<br />lonely widow
22115777 22117311 all alone in that lonely house
22117346 22120247 with the gramophone<br />blaring <i>The Mikado.</i>
22120282 22122950 Perhaps you turned<br />up the volume<br />to drown out her cries.
22122985 22124785 No, when I left her<br />she was alive!
22124820 22127754 But when the housekeeper<br />came back, she was dead.
22127789 22131592 The house had been ransacked,<br />it said so in the papers.<br />It must have been a burglar.
22131627 22133093 Look, I didn't do it.
22133128 22135762 No matter how bad things look,<br />I didn't do it!
22135797 22138032 You must believe me!<br />You do believe me,<br />don't you?
22140802 22143103 I do now,<br />but I wasn't sure.
22143138 22146607 That's why I subjected<br />your eyes and my arteries<br />to that ordeal.
22146642 22149176 I'm sorry.<br />That's all right.
22149211 22153180 As for things looking bad,<br />they don't look bad, Mr. Vole,<br />they look terrible.
22153215 22154982 Apparently,<br />you've no alibi at all.
22155017 22157484 I have. I left<br />Mrs. French's at 9:00.
22157519 22159319 How did you go home,<br />by bus or underground?
22159354 22160821 No, I walked.<br />It was a fine night.
22160856 22162823 Did anyone see you?
22162858 22164291 Yes, of course,<br />Christine saw me<br />when I got home.
22164326 22166293 It was 9:26 exactly.
22166328 22168028 I know because<br />I went right to work<br />on this new sort
22168063 22169463 of clock thing<br />that I've been<br />tinkering with.
22169498 22170864 My wife<br />will tell you that.
22170899 22172332 Your wife loves you,<br />does she not?
22172367 22173667 Very much.<br />And I love her.
22173702 22175135 We're devoted<br />to each other.
22175170 22176703 Of course, you realize,<br />Mr. Vole,
22176738 22178472 that the testimony<br />of a devoted wife
22178507 22180841 does not carry<br />much weight.
22180876 22183143 You mean people might think<br />Christine would tell a lie<br />on my account?
22183178 22185145 It has been known,<br />Mr. Vole.
22185180 22188215 Blood is thicker<br />than evidence.
22188250 22191218 WILFRID: Ah, Brogan-Moore,<br />come in, come in.
22191253 22193353 So good to have you out<br />of hospital.
22193388 22196156 I didn't get<br />a full pardon,<br />I'm out on parole.
22196191 22198392 You know Mr. Mayhew,<br />I believe.
22198427 22200494 This is his client,<br />Mr. Leonard Vole.
22200529 22201662 How do you do?<br />How do you do?
22201697 22203564 The Emily French murder.
22203599 22204498 Oh, how do you do?
22204533 22207034 Badly, thank you.
22207069 22208902 There's a mass<br />of circumstantial evidence,<br />no alibi whatsoever.
22208937 22210203 It's a hot potato.
22210238 22211738 Tossing it<br />right into your lap.
22211773 22213373 (CHUCKLING) Much obliged.
22213408 22216009 Your line of defense, however,<br />will be lack of motive.
22216044 22219346 You will agree that<br />we can rule out<br />a crime of passion, hmm?
22219381 22221181 That leaves us<br />with a murder for profit.
22221216 22224217 Now then,<br />if Mr. Vole had been<br />sponging on Mrs. French,
22224252 22226420 why kill her and cut off<br />the source of supply?
22226455 22229189 Or, if he'd been hoping<br />for a golden egg,
22229224 22231224 why kill the goose<br />before it was laid?
22231259 22233060 No motive.<br />No motive whatsoever!
22235897 22238432 You find some flaw<br />in this line of reasoning?
22238467 22240934 No, no, it's very sound,<br />as far as it goes.
22240969 22243036 Well, it's all yours,<br />Brogan-Moore.
22243071 22245238 You'll find Mr. Vole<br />very responsive<br />and quite candid.
22245273 22247207 So candid, in fact,<br />he's already informed me
22247242 22249042 we'll have to sue him<br />for our fees.
22249077 22251779 Oh, we'll simply put a lien<br />on Mr. Vole's 680,000.
22252648 22254448 What 680,000?
22254483 22256950 The 680,000<br />Mrs. French left you.
22256985 22259252 Left me?
22259287 22262122 They opened Mrs. French's<br />bank vault today<br />and found her will.
22264593 22265826 Congratulations!
22266962 22269262 680,000!
22269297 22271398 And I was worried<br />about a couple of hundred
22271433 22274268 for that silly eggbeater<br />of mine, and now...<br />I must call Christine.
22278807 22281408 Oh.
22281443 22283610 This inheritance doesn't<br />make things look any better<br />for me though, does it?
22283645 22286146 No. I wouldn't think so.
22286181 22288315 So now they'll say<br />that I did have a motive.<br />They will, indeed.
22288350 22290951 680,000 makes<br />for a very handsome motive.
22292521 22294488 I thought you were crazy,
22294523 22295922 but I guess now<br />they will arrest me,<br />won't they?
22295957 22297458 It's not unlikely.
22298460 22300361 (CAR APPROACHING)
22301363 22302630 (TIRES SQUEALING)
22305333 22306767 As a matter of fact,<br />it's quite likely.
22306802 22308769 They're on their way up, now.
22308804 22310337 Look, I knew nothing<br />about that will.
22310372 22311938 I had no idea that<br />Mrs. French
22311973 22313440 had any intention<br />of leaving me her money.
22313475 22315809 And if I didn't know about it,<br />how could it be a motive?
22315844 22318145 Mr. Brogan-Moore<br />will certainly bring<br />that out in court.
22318180 22320280 It's our old friend,<br />Inspector Hearne.
22320315 22322449 Chief Inspector,<br />as of last month.
22322484 22324284 Chief Inspector!
22324319 22326453 They must think a lot of you<br />at Scotland Yard.
22326488 22328989 You're getting<br />the de luxe treatment.
22329024 22332292 Oh, in here,<br />Chief Inspector.
22332327 22334995 Sorry to disturb you<br />in your chambers,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
22335030 22336630 That's perfectly<br />all right.
22336665 22338632 I never object<br />to the actions<br />of the police,
22338667 22340867 except once in a great while<br />in court.
22340902 22342669 Yes, sir.<br />I still have the scars.
22342704 22345305 You know Mr. Mayhew,<br />Mr. Brogan-Moore.
22345340 22347207 This is dangerous<br />Leonard Vole.
22347242 22349876 You'd better search him,<br />he may be armed<br />with an eggbeater.
22349911 22351311 INSPECTOR: Is your name<br />Leonard Vole?
22351346 22352846 Yes, it is.
22352881 22355215 I have here a warrant<br />for your arrest
22355250 22358485 on the charge<br />of murdering Emily French<br />on October the 14th, last.
22358520 22360220 I must warn you<br />that anything you say
22360255 22362523 may be taken down<br />and used in evidence.
22363558 22364991 Well, I'm ready.
22365026 22366660 But must I be handcuffed?
22366695 22369162 That won't be necessary, sir.
22369197 22370697 See, I've never been<br />arrested before,
22370732 22373166 not even for walking<br />a dog off a lead
22373201 22374868 or having a beer<br />after hours.
22374903 22377003 There's no disgrace<br />in being arrested, Mr. Vole.
22377038 22380540 Kings, prime ministers,<br />archbishops, even barristers
22380575 22382076 have stood in the dock.
22387082 22389049 Somebody better call<br />my wife and tell her<br />where they're taking me.
22389084 22391518 I will,<br />don't worry.
22391553 22393353 I'll go to the station<br />with you and see that<br />you're properly charged.
22393388 22395589 You will see to it<br />that Mr. Vole<br />is well treated?
22395624 22397924 We will.<br />Would you like a cigar?
22397959 22398959 Pardon me.
22401296 22402929 That's very kind of you,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
22402964 22405566 I'd better not.<br />It would constitute<br />a bribe.
22406568 22408068 (SIGHS)
22408103 22409436 We ought to be going,<br />Mr. Vole.
22414242 22416042 Well, there's one thing<br />I've learned for sure,
22416077 22418078 never look in a window<br />where there are women's hats.
22418113 22419480 Good day, sir.
22422417 22424384 Makes a very nice impression,<br />doesn't he?
22424419 22425886 Yes, rather.
22425921 22427387 Did you give him<br />the monocle test?
22427422 22429289 Passed with flying colors.
22429324 22431725 Yes, I hope he does<br />as well in the dock.<br />Yeah.
22431760 22433560 This is sticky,<br />you know?<br />Of course it is.
22433595 22436630 The prosecution will blast him<br />with their heaviest artillery.
22436665 22438398 All you'll have<br />is one little popgun,
22438433 22441434 an alibi furnished<br />by his wife.
22441469 22443904 Isn't that<br />an intriguing challenge?
22443939 22445739 I think I'd like it more<br />if it was less<br />of a challenge
22445774 22447808 and less intriguing.
22447843 22449743 Sorry, Sir Wilfrid,
22449778 22451778 but Miss Plimsoll<br />has issued<br />an ultimatum,
22451813 22453780 if you're not in bed<br />in one minute,<br />she will resign.
22453815 22454981 Splendid.<br />Give her a month's pay
22455016 22457083 and kick her<br />down the stairs.
22457118 22459085 Sir Wilfrid,<br />either you take proper<br />care of yourself
22459120 22460587 or I, too,<br />shall resign.
22460622 22461955 This is blackmail.
22461990 22463824 But you're quite right,<br />Carter.
22463859 22465258 For my first day,<br />this has already<br />been rather hectic.
22465293 22466927 I should be in bed.
22466962 22467795 Ah.
22471499 22474634 Oh, I'd-- I'd better<br />get in touch with Mrs. Vole<br />and have her come over.
22474669 22477003 Will you sit in?<br />Thank you, no.
22477038 22479706 I'm in no condition<br />to cope with emotional wives<br />drenched in tears.
22482210 22485512 Ah, Miss Plimsoll,<br />how alluring you look!
22485547 22487781 Waiting like a hangman<br />on the scaffold.
22487816 22490317 Take me, I'm yours.
22492487 22495789 Oh, uh, about Mrs. Vole,<br />handle her gently,
22495824 22497991 especially when<br />you break the news<br />of the arrest.
22498026 22499159 Bear in mind,<br />she's a foreigner,
22499194 22501027 so be prepared<br />for hysterics
22501062 22502796 and even a fainting spell.
22502831 22504631 Better have smelling<br />salts ready,
22504666 22507000 a box of tissues<br />and a nip of brandy.
22507035 22509670 WOMAN: I do not think<br />that will be necessary.
22513875 22516543 I never faint<br />because I'm not sure that<br />I will fall gracefully,
22516578 22520380 and I never use smelling salts<br />because they puff up the eyes.
22520415 22522983 I am Christine Vole.
22523018 22525719 How do you do?<br />This is Mr. Brogan-Moore.
22525754 22527654 How do you do?<br />How do you do?
22527689 22529489 I am Wilfrid Robarts.
22529524 22531992 How do you do?
22532027 22534527 My dear Mrs. Vole,<br />I'm afraid we have<br />rather bad news for you.
22534562 22537364 Don't be afraid,<br />Sir Wilfrid.<br />I'm quite disciplined.
22537399 22539666 There's nothing<br />to be alarmed about as yet.
22539701 22543003 Leonard has been arrested<br />and charged with murder,<br />is that it?
22543038 22546406 Yes.<br />I knew he would be.<br />I told him so.
22546441 22549075 I'm glad you're showing<br />such fortitude.
22549110 22551011 Call it what you like.
22551046 22553013 What is the next step?
22553048 22555682 Your husband<br />will have to stand trial,<br />I'm afraid.
22555717 22558184 Will you take<br />Mrs. Vole inside<br />and explain the procedure?
22558219 22560587 Mr. Brogan-Moore<br />will lead the defense.
22560622 22562522 Oh?
22562557 22564424 You will not personally<br />defend Leonard?
22564459 22566426 Regrettably, not.
22566461 22568194 My health,<br />or rather the lack of it,<br />forbids me.
22568229 22570530 It is regrettable.
22570565 22573233 Mr. Mayhew described you<br />as the champion<br />of the hopeless cause.
22576805 22579940 Is it perhaps<br />that this cause<br />is too hopeless?
22588249 22590884 I shall have<br />a very serious talk<br />with Dr. Harrison.
22590919 22593053 It was a mistake<br />to let you come back here.
22593088 22595789 I should've taken you<br />directly to a rest home<br />or a resort.
22595824 22598591 Some place quiet,<br />far off, like Bermuda.
22598626 22601394 Shut up.<br />You just want to see me<br />in those nasty shorts.
22601429 22602896 Come, now, Sir Wilfrid.
22602931 22605065 You must not<br />think of it.
22605100 22606266 You must get ready<br />for sleep.
22606301 22607768 Think beautiful<br />thoughts.
22609604 22611771 Now, let's get undressed.
22611806 22615141 Put these on,<br />tops and the bottoms,<br />while I make your bed.
22615176 22618611 Now, after your rest,<br />we'll have a nice cup<br />of cocoa,
22618646 22621614 and then perhaps<br />we'll have a walk<br />around the square.
22621649 22624417 You know, I feel sorry<br />for that nice Mr. Vole.
22624452 22626252 And not just because<br />he was arrested,
22626287 22628421 but that wife of his,<br />she must be German.
22628456 22630457 I suppose that's<br />what happens
22630492 22632959 when we let our boys<br />cross the channel,<br />they go crazy.
22632994 22634761 Personally,<br />I think the government
22634796 22638665 should do something<br />about those foreign wives,<br />like an embargo.
22638700 22641101 How else can we take care<br />of our own surplus?
22641136 22642635 Don't you agree,<br />Sir Wilfrid?
22642670 22644304 All right, hop in.
22646207 22647207 Sir Wilfrid?
22651312 22652312 Sir Wilfrid!
22653148 22655181 Come back!
22655216 22656783 Yes, of course I knew<br />that Leonard
22656818 22658852 had been seeing Mrs. French<br />quite frequently.
22660221 22661688 Go on, go on.
22661723 22663490 I knew it from the day<br />when he came home
22663525 22665792 with a pair of green socks<br />she had knitted for him.
22665827 22669129 Well, that's quite natural.<br />I'm sure the jury will find it<br />rather endearing.
22669164 22670964 Oh, Leonard can be<br />very endearing.
22670999 22673033 He hates that particular<br />shade of green
22673068 22675301 and the socks were two sizes<br />too large,
22675336 22678138 but he wore them<br />just the same,<br />just to give her pleasure.
22678173 22680373 Leonard has a way<br />with women.
22680408 22683143 I only hope he will have<br />an all-woman jury.
22683178 22686046 They will carry him<br />from the courtroom in triumph.
22686081 22688181 (CHUCKLING) A simple<br />acquittal will do.
22688216 22691518 Now, Mrs. Vole,<br />you know that Mrs. French<br />left your husband money?
22691553 22694154 Yes, a lot of money.
22694189 22698224 Of course, your husband<br />had no previous knowledge<br />of this bequest.
22698259 22701161 Is that what he told you?
22701196 22703663 Well, surely, Mrs. Vole,<br />you're not suggesting<br />anything different?
22703698 22705565 Oh, no. No.
22705600 22708234 I do not suggest anything.
22708269 22711337 Quite obviously, Mrs. French<br />had come to look<br />upon your husband
22711372 22714374 as a son or, perhaps,<br />a favorite nephew.
22714409 22718011 You think Mrs. French<br />looked upon Leonard<br />as a son or a nephew?
22718046 22719879 I do. An entirely natural
22719914 22722182 and understandable<br />relationship.
22722217 22724217 What hypocrites<br />you are in this country.
22727122 22729923 Pardon me,<br />Brogan-Moore.
22729958 22733026 Mrs. Vole, do you mind<br />if I ask you a question?
22733061 22735428 Go right ahead,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
22735463 22738698 Mrs. Vole, you realize<br />your husband's entire defense<br />rests on his word and yours.
22738733 22740533 I realize that.
22740568 22742368 And that the jury<br />will be quite skeptical
22742403 22744037 of the word of a man<br />accused of murder
22744072 22746272 when supported only<br />by the word of his wife?
22746307 22748575 I realize that, too.
22748610 22751711 Let us then at least<br />make sure that the two<br />are not in conflict.
22751746 22753746 CHRISTINE: By all means,<br />let's.
22753781 22756249 Mrs. Vole, I assume<br />you want to help<br />your husband?
22756284 22757617 Of course I want<br />to help Leonard,
22757652 22759285 I want to help<br />Mr. Brogan-Moore,
22759320 22761554 and I want to help you,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
22761589 22763957 There.
22763992 22766726 Isn't that more<br />comfortable for you?
22766761 22770130 Now, Mrs. Vole,<br />this is very important.
22770165 22773399 On the night of the murder,<br />your husband came home<br />before 9:30.
22773434 22775568 Is that correct?<br />CHRISTINE: Precisely.
22775603 22777570 Isn't that what<br />he wants me to say?
22777605 22779639 Isn't it the truth?
22779674 22781574 Of course.
22781609 22783109 But when I told it<br />to the police,
22783144 22784744 I do not think<br />they believed me.
22784779 22786446 Maybe I didn't say it well.
22786481 22788114 Maybe because<br />of my accent.
22788149 22790650 My dear Mrs. Vole,<br />in our courts
22790685 22794254 we will accept the evidence<br />of witnesses who speak<br />only Bulgarian
22794289 22796923 and who must have<br />an interpreter.
22796958 22800260 We will accept the evidence<br />of deaf-mutes who cannot<br />speak at all,
22800295 22802262 as long as they tell<br />the truth.
22802297 22803763 You're aware,<br />of course,
22803798 22805798 that when I put you<br />in the witness box,
22805833 22807467 you will be sworn<br />and you will testify<br />under oath?
22807502 22809302 Yes.
22809337 22811938 Leonard came home<br />at 9:26 precisely
22811973 22813640 and did not go out again.
22813675 22816943 The truth, the whole truth<br />and nothing but the truth.
22816978 22818211 Is that better?
22820315 22824284 Mrs. Vole, do you love<br />your husband?
22824319 22827453 Leonard thinks I do.<br />Well, do you?
22827488 22829622 Am I already under oath?
22829657 22831457 Mrs. Vole, whatever<br />your gambit may be,
22831492 22833793 do you know<br />that under British law
22833828 22837130 you cannot be called<br />to give testimony<br />damaging to your husband?
22837165 22839199 How very convenient.
22839234 22841668 We are dealing<br />with a capital crime.
22841703 22846005 The prosecution will try<br />to hang your husband.
22846040 22847574 He is not my husband.
22855350 22858151 Leonard and I went<br />through a form of marriage<br />in Hamburg,
22858186 22860553 but I had a husband<br />living at the time,<br />somewhere in East Germany
22860588 22862188 in the Russian zone.
22862223 22864324 Did you tell Leonard?<br />I did not.
22864359 22866059 It would have been stupid<br />to tell him.
22866094 22867493 He would not<br />have married me
22867528 22868661 and I would have<br />been left behind,
22868696 22871164 to starve in the rubble.
22871199 22873333 But he did marry you<br />and brought you safely<br />to this country.
22873368 22875735 Don't you think you should<br />be very grateful to him?
22875770 22878071 One can get very tired<br />of gratitude.
22878106 22880340 Your husband loves you<br />very much, does he not?
22880375 22882041 Leonard?
22882076 22884177 He worships the ground<br />I walk on.
22884212 22886579 And you?
22886614 22889015 You want to know<br />too much.
22889050 22890717 <i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i><br />gentlemen.
22892553 22894187 Thank you for coming in,<br />Mrs. Vole.
22894222 22896723 Your visit has been<br />most reassuring.
22898092 22900193 Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid.
22900228 22903062 I will give him an alibi<br />and I shall be<br />very convincing.
22903097 22905265 There will be tears<br />in my eyes when I say,
22905300 22908401 "Leonard came home<br />at 9:26 precisely."
22908436 22911438 You're a very remarkable<br />woman, Mrs. Vole.
22913074 22915541 And you're satisfied,<br />I hope?
22915576 22916776 (DOOR CLOSING)
22916811 22920580 I'm damned<br />if I'm satisfied.
22920615 22922782 Care to join me<br />in a whiff of those<br />smelling salts?
22922817 22925451 The woman's<br />up to something,<br />but what?
22925486 22927387 The prosecution<br />will break her<br />down in no time
22927422 22929222 when I put her<br />in the witness box.
22929257 22930557 You know,<br />defending this case
22930592 22933426 is going to be<br />rather like <i>The Charge</i><br /><i>Of The Light Brigade</i>
22933461 22935461 or one of those Japanese<br />suicide pilots.
22935496 22939465 Quite one-sided,<br />with the odds<br />all on the other side.
22939500 22942135 I haven't got<br />much to go on,<br />have I?
22942170 22943770 The fact is,<br />I've got nothing.
22945807 22948241 Let me ask you something.
22948276 22951144 Do you believe<br />Leonard Vole is innocent?
22954449 22955615 Do you?
22957785 22959119 Do you?
22960488 22962922 I'm not sure.
22962957 22966659 Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.<br />Of course, I'll do my best.
22966694 22969128 It's all right,<br />Brogan-Moore.
22969163 22973433 I'll take it from here.
22973468 22975335 I have called<br />Dr. Harrison<br />and given him
22975370 22977503 a complete report<br />on your shocking behavior.
22977538 22979439 I can no longer...
22979474 22981107 Give me a match,<br />Miss Plimsoll.<br />Sir Wilfrid!
22981142 22983510 Did you hear me?<br />A match!
23015910 23017643 Hello, Mr. Mayhew.
23017678 23020012 Sir Wilfrid.
23020047 23021814 Mr. Mayhew tells me<br />that you are going<br />to represent me.
23021849 23024016 I'm very grateful.<br />I struck a bargain<br />with my doctors.
23024051 23025885 I let them exile me<br />to Bermuda
23025920 23028721 as soon as<br />we finish your case.<br />Thank you.
23028756 23030323 Let's hope<br />that we shall<br />both survive.
23030358 23032058 Get into these, will you.<br />We need a photograph.
23032093 23033826 What for?<br />Cause these were what<br />you were wearing
23033861 23035161 on the night<br />of the murder.
23035196 23036562 We want to circulate<br />a photograph
23036597 23038164 on the chance<br />that someone did see you
23038199 23039365 leaving Mrs. French<br />on your way home.
23039400 23040934 Over here<br />against the wall, please.
23043538 23045338 Now, hold it.
23045373 23047173 Now, one more<br />in profile, please.
23047208 23048875 I mean, after all,<br />do we really need this?
23048910 23050710 My wife knows<br />what time I came<br />home that night.
23050745 23053679 A disinterested witness<br />may be of more value.
23053714 23056682 Yes, of course.<br />Christine is an<br />interested witness.
23056717 23058551 I'll pick up<br />the negatives later,<br />thank you.
23058586 23060520 I don't understand it.
23060555 23062555 Why hasn't she come<br />to see me?
23064058 23065691 Won't they<br />let her see me?
23065726 23067693 I mean, it's been<br />two weeks now.
23067728 23070696 Mayhew, give me<br />the reports.
23070731 23072265 Have you been<br />talking to her?
23072300 23074066 Is there something<br />the matter with her?
23074101 23076269 I want to read you<br />a portion of the evidence
23076304 23078238 of Janet McKenzie,<br />the housekeeper.
23083277 23086946 "Mr. Vole helped Mrs. French<br />with her business affairs
23086981 23088581 "particularly<br />her income tax returns."
23088616 23090383 LEONARD: Oh, yes, I did.
23090418 23092552 Some of those forms<br />are very complicated.
23092587 23095455 There's also a hint<br />you may have helped her<br />draft her new will.
23095490 23096789 Oh, that's not true!
23096824 23098724 If Janet said that,<br />she's lying!
23098759 23099725 She was always against me.
23099760 23101127 I--I don't know why.
23101162 23102628 Well, it's quite obvious.
23102663 23104464 You threw an eggbeater
23104499 23107900 into the wheels<br />of her Victorian household.
23107935 23109735 Now, um, what about<br />this cut on your wrist?
23109770 23111604 You told the police<br />you cut yourself with a knife.
23111639 23113473 Well, that's true. I did.
23113508 23115608 I was cutting bread<br />and the knife slipped.
23115643 23118077 But that was two days<br />after the murder.
23118112 23121314 Christine was there.<br />She'll tell them<br />when she gives evidence.
23123317 23125751 Are you keeping<br />something from me?
23125786 23128421 Is she ill?<br />Was she shocked<br />by what happened to me?
23128456 23130256 All things considered,<br />I think she took it very well.
23130291 23132258 Of course, that may have<br />only been on the surface.
23132293 23135595 Wives are often<br />profoundly disturbed<br />at such a time.
23135630 23137263 Yes, it must<br />be hard on her.
23137298 23138631 We've never been<br />separated before
23138666 23140266 not since<br />our first meeting.
23140301 23143169 How did you meet<br />your wife, Mr. Vole?
23143204 23145004 In Germany, in 1945.
23146641 23147840 It's rather funny.
23147875 23149275 The very first time<br />I saw her,
23149310 23152278 the ceiling fell<br />right in on me.

23374902 23378738 (ACCORDION PLAYING)<br />I'm terribly sorry.
23378773 23380172 You'd better<br />get out of here.

23381242 23383342 Actually,<br />it's your own fault.
23383377 23385845 That costume<br />in the picture outside<br />gave the boys ideas,
23385880 23387847 and then<br />those trousers of yours<br />let them down hard.
23387882 23390015 That costume went on<br />the first raid on Hamburg.
23390050 23391550 Then, raid by raid,<br />the rest of my dresses,
23391585 23393519 and now you've bombed<br />my trousers.

23412239 23414206 How much?
23414241 23416208 Well, I don't know.<br />What's the rate<br />of exchange?
23416243 23418210 Depends whether<br />it's fresh coffee<br />or powdered...
23418245 23420045 It's instant coffee.
23420080 23422448 Ooh.<br />Got any hot water<br />at your place?
23422483 23423616 Sometimes.
23423651 23424717 Let's take a chance.
23424752 23425885 Where do you live?
23425920 23426986 Nearby.
23428255 23429422 Come.
23436797 23439064 Sorry, it's the maid's<br />night off.
23439099 23440900 This is pretty<br />horrible,
23440935 23442902 in a <i>gemutlich</i><br />sort of way.
23442937 23445437 Oh, it's fine now.<br />I used to have<br />a roommate.
23445472 23448073 A dancer. She had luck.<br />She married a Canadian.
23448108 23450109 She now<br />lives in Toronto.
23450144 23452745 She has<br />a Ford automobile.
23452780 23454413 You better make yourself<br />comfortable.
23454448 23455915 The stove is slow<br />these days.
23455950 23457316 Oh, that's all right.
23457351 23459318 I've got a weekend pass.
23459353 23461487 No, no,<br />not that chair.
23461522 23463289 It holds up the beam<br />and that holds up<br />half the ceiling.
23463324 23465491 You'd better sit down<br />on the cot.
23465526 23467760 The cot?
23467795 23470162 It's getting<br />more <i>gemutlich</i><br />all the time.
23470197 23471597 Are you married?<br />Why?
23471632 23473098 Well, the, uh...
23473133 23474333 Oh, that.
23474368 23476268 No, no, I'm not married,
23476303 23478137 I just wear it<br />when I'm working.
23478172 23480272 It gives me<br />a little protection<br />with all the men.
23480307 23481607 Didn't work<br />too well tonight,<br />though, did it?
23481642 23483509 No. Tonight was bad.
23484845 23486712 But it's getting better.
23490651 23491951 Where's the coffee?
23491986 23494119 Ahh, coffee, <i>jawohl.</i>
23494154 23496288 The finest Brazilian blend.
23496323 23499192 The same brand<br />that Field Marshal<br />Montgomery drinks.
23517177 23519478 Is that a fair rate<br />of exchange?
23519513 23520680 Very fair.
23522750 23524516 Would, uh...<br />Would you be interested
23524551 23526018 in having the whole tin?
23527087 23528187 I would.
23538098 23540366 How're you fixed<br />for sugar?
23540401 23542167 I could use some.
23542202 23543069 Milk?
23543871 23544770 Sure.
23547541 23549542 Milk, sugar.
23551378 23553512 It is a pleasure<br />to do business with you.
23553547 23554614 Yeah.
23560587 23562688 I also carry, uh...
23562723 23564690 Biscuits, powdered eggs,
23564725 23567426 bacon, marmalade.
23567461 23569361 I don't know<br />if I can afford it.
23569396 23571363 Don't worry.
23571398 23573732 We'll work out<br />something like<br />an installment plan.

23590284 23591717 Ooh.
23591752 23593218 Are you all right?
23593253 23595054 Yes, I think so.<br />My head aches a little.
23595089 23597556 Maybe I can fix it.
23597591 23598824 I'm good at it.
23605599 23607266 <i>I had a weekend pass,</i>
23607301 23608968 a month's pay<br />in my pocket...
23609003 23611470 And she already<br />had a wedding ring?
23611505 23613739 Yes, that's right.<br />So we got married,
23613774 23614974 and as soon as I got<br />out of the service,
23615009 23616241 I brought her to England.
23616276 23617576 Oh, it was wonderful.
23617611 23620245 I rented a little flat<br />on Edgware road.
23620280 23623916 The first time she saw it,<br />Christine was so happy<br />she broke down and cried.
23623951 23625951 Naturally,<br />she had a solid roof
23625986 23628420 over her head and<br />a British passport.
23628455 23629955 You don't<br />really know Christine,
23629990 23631590 and how she feels<br />about me,
23631625 23633326 but you will<br />when she gives<br />her evidence.
23634361 23636495 Mr. Vole,
23636530 23640132 I must tell you<br />I am not putting her<br />in the witness box.
23640167 23642301 You're not? Why not?
23642336 23644436 Well, for one thing,<br />she's a foreigner,
23644471 23646772 not too familiar<br />with the subtleties<br />of our language.
23646807 23648941 The prosecution<br />could easily<br />trip her up.
23648976 23650676 I hear it may be Mr. Myers<br />for the crown.
23650711 23652177 And we can't<br />take chances with him.
23652212 23653946 Quite. Well,<br />we'd better be going.
23653981 23655647 Miss Plimsoll<br />is waiting in the car
23655682 23659618 with her pills<br />and a thermos<br />of lukewarm cocoa.
23659653 23661787 Officer.<br />But Christine<br />must give evidence.
23661822 23664623 Mr. Vole, you must<br />learn to trust me.
23664658 23666158 If for no other<br />reason than that
23666193 23667860 I'm a mean,<br />ill-tempered old man
23667895 23669795 who hates to lose.
23669830 23671564 Let us<br />wish each other luck.
23677504 23679638 But I can't face<br />this without Christine.
23679673 23680973 I tell you,<br />I'm scared.
23681008 23682675 I need her.<br />Without her, I'm sunk.
23684678 23686545 Touching, isn't it?
23686580 23689481 The way he counts<br />on his wife.<br />Yes.
23689516 23692885 Like a drowning man<br />clutching at a razor blade.
23708702 23711170 CLERK: Leonard Stephen Vole,
23711205 23713372 you are charged<br />on indictment
23713407 23716708 for that you,<br />on the 14th day of October,
23716743 23718677 in the county<br />of London,
23718712 23722014 murdered<br />Emily Jane French.
23722049 23724516 How say you,<br />Leonard Stephen Vole?
23724551 23726018 Are you guilty
23726053 23727086 or not guilty?
23729556 23730790 Not guilty.
23733060 23735194 Members of the jury,
23735229 23737262 the prisoner<br />stands indicted
23737297 23740265 for that he<br />on the 14th day of October
23740300 23743368 murdered<br />Emily Jane French.
23743403 23745537 To this indictment<br />he has pleaded,
23745572 23747206 "Not guilty,"
23747241 23749208 and it is your<br />charge to say,
23749243 23751043 having heard<br />the evidence,
23751078 23753779 whether he be guilty<br />or not.
23758418 23759718 Members of the jury,
23759753 23762221 by the oath<br />which you have just taken,
23762256 23765591 you have sworn<br />to try this case<br />on the evidence.
23765626 23767893 You must shut out<br />from your minds
23767928 23772131 everything except<br />what will take<br />place in this court.
23772166 23775767 You may proceed<br />for the prosecution,<br />Mr. Myers.
23775802 23777636 May it please you,<br />my Lord.
23777671 23779238 Members of the jury,
23779273 23781073 I appear in this case
23781108 23782641 with my learned<br />friend, Mr. Barton,
23782676 23784076 for the prosecution.
23784111 23785811 And my learned friends,
23785846 23788247 Sir Wilfrid Robarts<br />and Mr. Brogan-Moore,
23788282 23789682 appear for the defense.
23794454 23797089 I trust we are not<br />to be deprived
23797124 23800259 of the learned<br />and stimulating presence<br />of Sir Wilfrid.
23800294 23802928 Ah, my Lord, may I assure<br />my learned friend<br />of the prosecution
23802963 23804596 that Sir Wilfrid is<br />in the Old Bailey.
23804631 23805797 He's slightly<br />incapacitated,
23805832 23807599 but he'll be<br />in his seat presently.
23807634 23810135 My Lord,<br />may I express my regret
23810170 23812804 that Sir Wilfrid<br />is even slightly<br />incapacitated?
23812839 23814940 You may, Mr. Myers.
23814975 23818677 You may also proceed<br />with the case<br />for the prosecution.
23818712 23820812 Thank you, my Lord.
23820847 23822814 Uh, the facts in this case<br />are simple
23822849 23824816 and to a point,<br />not in dispute.
23824851 23826852 You will hear<br />how the prisoner
23826887 23829154 made the acquaintance<br />of Mrs. Emily French,
23829189 23831323 a woman of 56.
23831358 23835360 How he was treated<br />by her with kindness<br />and even affection.
23835395 23838130 On the night of<br />October the 14th last,
23838165 23839698 between 9:30 and 10:00,
23839733 23843302 Mrs. French was murdered.
23843337 23845003 Medical testimony<br />will be introduced
23845038 23847172 to prove that<br />death was caused
23847207 23849374 by a blow from a blunt<br />and heavy instrument.
23849409 23852010 And it is the case<br />for the prosecution
23852045 23853645 that the blow was dealt
23853680 23855347 by the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole.
23855382 23857216 That's not true.<br />I didn't do it!
23857251 23858184 (ALL MURMURING)
23860087 23862688 Among the<br />witnesses, you will hear<br />police evidence,
23862723 23865023 also, the evidence<br />of Mrs. French's housekeeper,
23865058 23866658 Janet McKenzie,
23866693 23869494 and from the medical<br />and laboratory experts,
23869529 23871029 and the evidence
23871064 23872664 of the murdered<br />woman's solicitor,
23872699 23875500 who drew her final will.
23875535 23878170 I will now call<br />Chief Inspector Hearne,
23878205 23880372 Criminal Investigation<br />Department,<br />New Scotland Yard.
23880407 23882341 USHER: Chief Inspector<br />Hearne.
23882376 23883408 POLICEMAN:<br />Chief Inspector Hearne.
23883443 23884910 Chief Inspector Hearne.
23891218 23893385 (MURMURING)
23903063 23904529 This is ridiculous.
23904564 23906064 Just a bit<br />of nervous heartburn.
23906099 23907933 I always get it<br />the first day of a trial.
23907968 23909534 240 above 130?
23909569 23910869 You shouldn't<br />be here at all.
23910904 23912204 I should be<br />in the courtroom.
23912239 23914206 The trial's begun.<br />Syringe, please.
23914241 23916875 Be a good, brave boy,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
23916910 23918577 Miss Plimsoll,<br />it may interest you<br />to know
23918612 23920579 that I am descended<br />from a warrior family,
23920614 23922281 which traces<br />its brave past
23922316 23924216 back to Richard<br />the Lion-Hearted.
23924251 23925317 (GASPING)
23928288 23930555 You're to have<br />a calcium injection daily,
23930590 23932891 a tranquillizing pill<br />every hour.
23932926 23934926 I'll set<br />my wristwatch alarm.
23934961 23936628 In case of<br />a sudden pain or<br />shortness of breath,
23936663 23938230 pop one of these<br />nitroglycerine<br />tablets
23938265 23940232 from the black box<br />under your tongue.
23940267 23941733 Oh, and<br />I'll leave you some<br />drops for...
23941768 23943735 Yes, th-that's<br />enough, Doctor.
23943770 23945937 The judge will be asking<br />for a saliva test.
23945972 23947906 Carter!
23947941 23950909 I'd better take<br />that thermos<br />of cocoa with me.
23950944 23952311 Helps me<br />wash down the pills.
23952346 23954613 Now, let me see it,<br />please.
23954648 23957816 My learned patient<br />is not above substituting<br />brandy for cocoa.
23957851 23959084 (SNIFFING)
23959119 23961953 It is cocoa.<br />So sorry.
23961988 23963422 If you were a woman,<br />Miss Plimsoll,
23963457 23965123 I would strike you.
23965158 23966959 Take care of this,<br />Carter.
23969463 23971129 Now, Sir Wilfrid,<br />in the courtroom,
23971164 23973332 you must avoid<br />over-excitement.
23973367 23975667 Yes, Doctor, yes,<br />yes, yes, yes, yes.
23975702 23977502 DOCTOR: Watch your temper.<br />Keep both your voice<br />and your blood pressure down.
23977537 23978970 Thank you, doctor.<br />I shall be quite safe,
23979005 23980973 what with the pills<br />and the cocoa.
23982175 23983876 Come along, Carter.
23985645 23987145 From the body temperature
23987180 23988513 and other factors,
23988548 23990148 we placed the time of death
23990183 23992784 at between 9:30<br />and 10:00 p.m.
23992819 23996788 approximately 30 minutes<br />before Janet McKenzie,<br />the housekeeper,
23996823 23998457 returned home<br />and called us.
23998492 24000158 Death was instantaneous
24000193 24002027 caused by one blow
24002062 24004629 from a heavy<br />and blunt instrument.
24004664 24006665 MYERS:<br />Were there any signs<br />of a struggle?
24006700 24008967 HEARNE:<br />None. Just the one blow.
24009002 24010969 Would that indicate to you
24011004 24013372 that the murderer<br />had taken Mrs. French<br />by surprise?
24013407 24017342 My Lord, I must object.
24017377 24021146 My learned friend<br />refers to the assailant<br />as the murderer.
24021181 24022681 We have<br />not yet determined
24022716 24024983 whether the assailant<br />was a man or a woman.
24025018 24027819 It could quite conceivably<br />have been the murderess.
24027854 24029721 Mr. Myers, it seems that
24029756 24032491 Sir Wilfrid has joined us<br />just in time to catch you
24032526 24034025 on a point of grammar.
24034060 24036228 Please rephrase<br />your question.
24036263 24037996 Yes, my Lord.
24038031 24039498 Uh, Inspector,
24039533 24040832 is it your opinion
24040867 24042501 that the assailant
24042536 24044870 whether he, she or it
24044905 24047038 had taken Mrs. French<br />by surprise?
24047073 24049207 My Lord,<br />I am taken by surprise
24049242 24051009 that my learned friend<br />should attempt
24051044 24052677 to solicit<br />from the witness<br />an opinion
24052712 24055080 and not a fact.
24055115 24057249 Quite so. You'll have<br />to do better than that,<br />Mr. Myers.
24057284 24059518 My Lord, I withdraw<br />the question entirely.
24059553 24060685 Is that better?
24060720 24063355 That's much better.
24063390 24064890 (CROWD MURMURING)
24067894 24069060 USHER: Silence.
24069095 24070262 Silence!
24070297 24073532 (GAVEL BANGING)
24073567 24076568 MYERS: Very well, Inspector,<br />let us proceed<br />with the facts in the case.
24076603 24079204 After establishing the cause<br />and the time of death,
24079239 24080872 what did you then do?
24080907 24083542 A search was made,<br />photographs were taken,
24083577 24084943 and the premises<br />were fingerprinted.
24084978 24086878 What fingerprints<br />did you discover?
24086913 24088947 I found<br />the fingerprints<br />of Mrs. French,
24088982 24091116 those<br />of Janet McKenzie,
24091151 24093785 and some,<br />which later proved to be<br />those of Leonard Vole.
24093820 24096054 MYERS: No others?<br />No others.
24096089 24099391 Now, did you say<br />that the room<br />had the appearance
24099426 24101126 that a robbery<br />had been committed?
24101161 24104062 Yes.<br />Things were strewn about
24104097 24106398 and the window<br />had been broken<br />near the catch.
24106433 24108233 There was glass<br />on the floor
24108268 24110469 and fragments<br />were found outside.
24110504 24113572 The glass outside<br />was not consistent
24113607 24115941 with the window<br />having been forced<br />from the outside.
24115976 24117642 What you are saying
24117677 24120245 is that someone attempted<br />to make it look
24120280 24121746 as if the window<br />had been forced
24121781 24123081 from the outside,<br />isn't that so?
24123116 24125250 My Lord, I must object.
24125285 24127986 My learned friend<br />is putting words<br />in the witness' mouth.
24128021 24130956 After all,<br />if he insists on answering<br />his own questions,
24130991 24133992 the presence<br />of the witness<br />would seem superfluous.
24134027 24136628 Quite.<br />Don't you think so,<br />Mr. Myers?
24136663 24138130 MYERS: Yes, my Lord.
24139866 24142434 Inspector,<br />did you ascertain
24142469 24145437 if any of<br />the murdered woman's<br />property was missing?
24145472 24148340 According to the housekeeper,<br />nothing was missing.
24148375 24150775 In your experience,<br />Inspector,
24150810 24151943 when burglars
24151978 24154513 or burglaresses
24154548 24157949 break into a house,<br />do they leave<br />without taking anything?
24157984 24159451 No, sir.
24159486 24161319 Do you produce<br />a jacket, Inspector?
24161354 24162454 Yes, sir.
24162489 24163889 Is that the jacket?
24167661 24169127 Yes, sir.
24169162 24172030 That is exhibit P1,<br />my Lord.
24172065 24174132 Where did you<br />find this, Inspector?
24174167 24176968 That is the jacket<br />found in the prisoner's flat,
24177003 24179337 which I handed<br />to our lab to test<br />for bloodstains.
24179372 24181640 And did you find<br />any bloodstains?
24181675 24184676 Yes, though an attempt<br />had been made<br />to wash them out.
24184711 24187145 What tests<br />did the laboratory make?
24187180 24191049 First, to determine<br />if the stains were made<br />by human blood,
24191084 24194019 then to classify it<br />by group or type.
24194054 24196488 And was the blood<br />of a particular<br />group or type?
24196523 24199658 Yes, sir.<br />It is type O.
24199693 24202561 And did you subsequently test<br />the blood of the dead woman?
24202596 24203662 Yes, sir.
24203697 24204763 What type was that?
24206700 24209334 The same, type O.
24209369 24212037 MYERS:<br />Thank you, Inspector.<br />No further questions.
24212939 24214839 Inspector,
24214874 24216741 you say that<br />the only fingerprints<br />you found
24216776 24218710 were those<br />of Mrs. French,
24218745 24220712 Janet McKenzie<br />and the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole.
24220747 24224349 In your experience,<br />when a burglar breaks in,
24224384 24226051 does he usually<br />leave fingerprints,
24226086 24227185 or does he<br />wear gloves?
24227220 24229020 He wears gloves.
24229055 24231022 So the absence<br />of fingerprints<br />in the case of robbery
24231057 24232023 would hardly<br />surprise you?
24232058 24233058 No, sir.
24233093 24234426 Can't we then surmise
24234461 24236061 that the burglar<br />might have entered
24236096 24238263 what was presumably<br />an empty house,
24238298 24240031 might have<br />suddenly encountered<br />Mrs. French and struck her,
24240066 24241533 then realizing<br />she was dead,
24241568 24243902 panicked and fled<br />without taking anything?
24243937 24247772 I submit, my Lord,<br />that it is entirely impossible<br />to guess what went on
24247807 24250909 in the mind<br />of some entirely<br />imaginary burglar,
24250944 24253378 uh, with or<br />without gloves.
24253413 24255614 Let us not surmise,<br />Sir Wilfrid,
24255649 24257583 but confine ourselves<br />to facts.
24260086 24262454 Inspector,<br />when you questioned<br />the prisoner
24262489 24264623 as to the stains<br />on his jacket,
24264658 24268560 did he not show you<br />a recently-healed scar<br />on his wrist,
24268595 24269794 and tell you that<br />he had cut himself
24269829 24271463 with a kitchen knife<br />while slicing bread?
24271498 24273932 Yes, sir,<br />that is what he said.
24273967 24275900 WILFRID: And were you not<br />told the same thing<br />by the prisoner's wife?
24275935 24277569 Yes, sir,<br />but afterwards...
24277604 24280138 Just a simple "yes"<br />or "no," please.
24280173 24282474 Did the prisoner's wife<br />show you a knife,
24282509 24284242 and tell you<br />that her husband
24284277 24286444 had cut his wrist<br />while slicing bread?
24286479 24288413 Yes, sir.
24288448 24290983 I will ask you to examine<br />this knife, Inspector.
24295822 24297622 Just test<br />the edge of it<br />with your finger.
24297657 24299257 Carefully!
24299292 24301159 You, uh, agree<br />that the point
24301194 24303094 and the cutting edge<br />are razor-sharp?
24303129 24304929 Yes, sir.
24304964 24306164 Now then,<br />if such a knife<br />were to slip,
24306199 24307599 might it not<br />inflict a cut
24307634 24308967 that would bleed<br />profusely?
24309002 24311102 Yes, sir, it might.
24311137 24313938 Now, Inspector,<br />you have stated<br />that the bloodstains
24313973 24316107 on the prisoner's jacket<br />were analyzed,
24316142 24318276 as was the blood<br />of Mrs. French,
24318311 24320979 and they were both found<br />to be of the same group,<br />group O?
24321014 24323314 That is correct.<br />However,
24323349 24325283 if the prisoner's blood
24325318 24326951 were also<br />of this same group,
24326986 24329120 then the stains<br />on his jacket
24329155 24331623 might very well<br />have resulted<br />from the household accident
24331658 24332657 he described to you.
24332692 24335460 Yes, sir.
24335495 24338163 Did you examine<br />the prisoner's blood,<br />Inspector?
24339199 24340232 No, sir.
24342402 24345704 I have here a certificate
24345739 24349808 stating that<br />Leonard Stephen Vole<br />is a blood donor
24349843 24352343 at the North London hospital
24352378 24354312 and that his blood is
24354347 24355814 group O.
24355849 24357416 (CROWD MURMURING)
24360186 24361753 Thank you, Inspector.
24365859 24368660 Inspector, granted that<br />the cut on the wrist
24368695 24370662 was caused<br />by that knife,
24370697 24372063 is there<br />anything to show
24372098 24373998 whether it was<br />an accident
24374033 24376868 or done deliberately<br />after the murder
24376903 24378203 to account for<br />the bloodstains?
24378238 24379671 Oh, really,<br />my Lord!
24379706 24381172 I withdraw<br />the question.
24381207 24382874 You may stand<br />down, Inspector.
24385278 24386845 MYERS: Call Janet McKenzie.
24386880 24388246 Janet McKenzie!

24419579 24423381 shall be the truth,<br />the whole truth<br />and nothing but the truth.

24426953 24428720 MYERS: Your name<br />is Janet McKenzie?
24428755 24430455 JANET: Aye,<br />that's my name.
24430490 24432457 When did you<br />first come to London?
24432492 24435560 That was many years ago.<br />Twenty eight years ago.
24435595 24437428 Where do you live?
24437463 24440231 Now that Mrs. French,<br />poor soul, is dead,
24440266 24443902 I've moved in with my niece<br />at 19 Glenister Road.
24443937 24446070 Uh, you were<br />companion-housekeeper
24446105 24447405 to the late<br />Mrs. Emily French?
24447440 24449240 I was her housekeeper.
24449275 24450742 I've no opinion<br />of companions
24450777 24452610 poor, feckless bodies
24452645 24454245 afraid to do<br />a bit of honest<br />domestic work.
24454280 24455246 Quite.<br />What I meant was,
24455281 24457248 you were on<br />friendly terms
24457283 24459417 not altogether<br />those of a mistress<br />and a servant.
24459452 24461085 Aye.
24461120 24462754 Ten years I was with her<br />and looked after her.
24462789 24465256 She knew me and<br />she trusted me.
24465291 24468760 Ah, many's the time<br />I prevented her of doing<br />a foolish thing.
24468795 24470795 Please tell us,<br />in your own words,
24470830 24474165 about the events<br />of the evening<br />of October the 14.
24474200 24475967 It was a Friday<br />and my night out.
24476002 24478102 I was going round<br />to see my niece
24478137 24480305 at Glenister Road,<br />which is about<br />five minutes' walk.
24480340 24483141 I left the house<br />at half past seven.
24483176 24485610 I'd promised to take her<br />a dress pattern<br />that she admired.
24485645 24487345 (GASPING)
24487380 24489113 Oh, is this thing<br />necessary?
24489148 24491115 An excellent<br />question.
24491150 24492617 However,<br />it has been installed
24492652 24495687 at considerable expense<br />to the taxpayers,
24495722 24497655 so let us take<br />advantage of it.
24497690 24499290 Please continue.
24499325 24501459 Well, when I got<br />to my niece's,
24501494 24503361 I found I'd left<br />the pattern behind.
24503396 24504863 So after supper,<br />I slipped back to get it,
24504898 24506798 as it was no distance.
24506833 24510301 I got back to the house<br />at 25 past nine.
24510336 24512637 I let myself in<br />and I went upstairs<br />to my room.
24512672 24514873 As I passed<br />the sitting room,
24514908 24518176 I heard the prisoner<br />in there, talking<br />to Mrs. French.
24518211 24520712 No, it wasn't me.<br />It wasn't my voice!
24520747 24522313 (CROWD MURMURING)
24522348 24524315 Talking and laughing<br />they were,
24524350 24525850 but it was<br />no business of mine,
24525885 24528219 so I went upstairs and<br />I fetched my pattern.
24528254 24531522 Now, let us be<br />very exact as to the time.
24531557 24535994 You say that<br />you reentered the house<br />at 25 past nine?
24536029 24538863 JANET: Aye, the pattern<br />was on a shelf in my room<br />next to my clock,
24538898 24540331 so I saw the time.
24540366 24543534 And it was 25 past nine.
24543569 24544869 MYERS: Go on, please.
24544904 24546504 I went back<br />to my niece.
24546539 24549374 Oh! She was delighted<br />with her pattern. S...
24550543 24552343 (SIGHS)
24552378 24554512 Simply delighted.
24554547 24556915 I stayed there<br />until 20 to 11.
24556950 24559350 And then I said<br />good night to them<br />and I come home.
24559385 24560752 I went into<br />the sitting room then
24560787 24563021 to see if the mistress<br />wanted anything
24563056 24565056 before she went to bed,
24565091 24566591 and there she was...
24566626 24568393 Dead!
24568428 24570528 And everything tossed<br />hither and thither.
24570563 24572931 Did you really think<br />that a burglary<br />had been committed?
24572966 24575400 My Lord, I must protest.
24575435 24579270 I will not allow<br />that question<br />to be answered, Mr. Myers.
24579305 24581372 Miss McKenzie,<br />were you aware
24581407 24583408 that Leonard Vole<br />was a married man?
24583443 24585043 No, indeed.
24585078 24586544 And neither was<br />the mistress.
24586579 24588713 Janet!<br />My Lord, I must object.
24588748 24590715 What Mrs. French knew<br />or did not know
24590750 24593285 is pure conjecture<br />on Janet McKenzie's part.
24595288 24598089 Let me put it this way,<br />you formed the opinion
24598124 24601392 that Mrs. French<br />thought Leonard Vole<br />was a single man?
24601427 24603394 Have you any facts<br />to support that opinion?
24603429 24605129 Well, there were the books<br />that she ordered.
24605164 24607231 There was<br /><i>The Life of Baroness</i><br /><i>Burdett-Coutts,</i>
24607266 24609734 and the one about<br />Disraeli and his wife
24609769 24611936 both of them about women
24611971 24614138 that married men<br />years younger<br />than themselves.
24614173 24615907 Oh, I knew<br />what she was thinking.
24615942 24617742 I'm afraid we cannot<br />admit that.
24617777 24619077 Why?
24619112 24620578 (CROWD LAUGHING)
24620613 24622480 Members of the jury,
24622515 24626250 it is possible<br />for a woman to read<br /><i>The Life of Disraeli</i>
24626285 24629921 without contemplating<br />marriage with a man<br />younger than herself.
24629956 24631323 (CROWD LAUGHING)
24632625 24634125 Miss McKenzie,
24634160 24636160 were you aware<br />of what arrangements
24636195 24638296 Mrs. French had made<br />for the disposal<br />of her money?
24638331 24639831 She had<br />her old will revoked
24639866 24641833 and a new one drawn up.
24641868 24644268 I heard her<br />calling Mr. Stokes,<br />her solicitor.
24644303 24647605 He was there at the time.<br />The prisoner, I mean.
24647640 24649841 You heard Mrs. French<br />and the prisoner
24649876 24651843 discussing her new will?
24651878 24654345 Yes. He was to have<br />all her money,<br />she told him,
24654380 24655980 as she had<br />no near relations,
24656015 24658683 nor anybody<br />that meant to her<br />what he did.
24658718 24660785 MYERS: When did this<br />take place?
24660820 24662453 On October the 8th,
24662488 24665957 one week to the day<br />before she was murdered.
24665992 24669527 Thank you.<br />That concludes<br />my examination.
24669562 24672664 Ah, not just yet,<br />Miss McKenzie.
24673666 24674866 Would you?
24675401 24676834 Thank you.
24676869 24678469 Miss McKenzie,
24678504 24681339 you have given evidence<br />about two wills.
24681374 24684175 In the old will,<br />the will that was revoked,
24684210 24687478 were you<br />not to receive the bulk<br />of Mrs. French's estate?
24687513 24688980 Aye, that's so.
24689015 24690481 Whereas<br />in the new will,
24690516 24693351 except for a bequest<br />to you of a small annuity,
24693386 24697155 the principal beneficiary<br />is the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole?
24697190 24698489 JANET: It will be<br />a wicked injustice
24698524 24700992 if he ever touches a penny<br />of that money.
24701027 24703394 It is entirely<br />understandable
24703429 24705663 that you are antagonistic<br />to the prisoner.
24705698 24707999 Oh, I'm not<br />antagonistic to him.
24708034 24710835 He's a shiftless,<br />scheming rascal,
24710870 24712336 but I'm not<br />antagonistic to him.
24712371 24714172 (CROWD LAUGHING)
24714207 24715506 I suggest that<br />you've formed<br />this opinion
24715541 24717508 because his friendship<br />with your mistress
24717543 24719177 cost you the bulk<br />of her estate.
24719212 24720678 I never liked him.
24720713 24723548 Your candor is refreshing.
24723583 24726551 Now, on the night<br />of October the 14th,
24726586 24729720 you say you heard<br />the prisoner and Mrs. French<br />talking together.
24729755 24731422 What did you<br />hear them say?
24731457 24733691 I didn't hear<br />what they actually said.
24733726 24735927 You mean you only<br />heard the voices?
24735962 24737862 The murmur of voices.
24737897 24740198 They were laughing.
24740233 24742200 What makes you say<br />the man's voice<br />was Leonard Vole's?
24742235 24744035 I know his voice<br />well enough.
24744070 24746771 WILFRID:<br />The door was closed,<br />was it not?
24746806 24748773 Aye, that's so.
24748808 24750708 You were no doubt<br />in a hurry<br />to get the pattern,
24750743 24753878 so you probably<br />walked quickly<br />past the closed door,
24753913 24756614 yet you are sure<br />you heard<br />Leonard Vole's voice?
24756649 24759217 I was there long enough<br />to hear what I heard.
24759252 24761219 Come, Miss McKenzie,
24761254 24763588 I'm sure you don't<br />wish to suggest<br />to the jury
24763623 24765456 that you were<br />eavesdropping.
24765491 24767225 I know it was him<br />in there with her.
24767260 24768626 Who else<br />could it have been?
24768661 24770895 Exactly. What you mean is<br />you wanted it to be him.
24770930 24773397 That's the way<br />your mind worked.
24773432 24777068 Now, tell me, did Mrs. French<br />sometimes watch television<br />in the evening?
24777103 24780104 JANET:<br />Yes, she was fond of a talk<br />or a good play.
24780139 24781572 Wasn't it possible<br />on the evening
24781607 24783241 when you returned home<br />and passed the door,
24783276 24785776 that what you really heard<br />was the television,
24785811 24788579 and a man and woman's<br />voices and laughter?
24788614 24791249 There was a play<br />called <i>Lover's Leap</i>
24791284 24792817 on the television<br />that night.
24793953 24796087 It was not the television.
24796122 24798923 Oh, why not?
24798958 24800658 Because the television<br />was away
24800693 24803294 being repaired that week.<br />That's why.

24821814 24824315 If my learned friend<br />has no further questions,<br />I would like to...
24824350 24827451 I have not<br />quite finished.
24827486 24829787 You are registered,<br />are you not,
24829822 24832290 under the<br />National Health<br />Insurance act?
24832325 24833791 Aye, that's so.
24833826 24836294 Four and sixpence<br />I pay out every week.
24836329 24837828 Ach, that's<br />a terrible lot<br />of money
24837863 24839797 for a working woman<br />to pay.
24839832 24842300 WILFRID:<br />I am sure that many<br />agree with you.
24842335 24844635 Now then, Miss McKenzie,
24844670 24848673 did you recently apply to<br />the National Health Insurance<br />for...
24848708 24850975 A hearing aid?
24851010 24852476 F-f-f-for what?
24852511 24854212 My Lord, I must protest<br />against the manner
24854247 24855813 in which this question<br />is being put.
24855848 24859016 I will repeat<br />the question,<br />my Lord.
24859051 24861852 I asked you, in a normal<br />tone of voice,
24861887 24865056 audible to everyone<br />in open court
24865091 24867692 did you apply to<br />the National Health Insurance
24867727 24869860 for a hearing aid?
24869895 24871362 Yes, I did.
24871397 24873664 Did you get it?<br />No, not yet.
24873699 24876867 However, you state that<br />you walked past a door
24876902 24879203 which is four inches<br />of solid oak,
24879238 24882740 you heard voices<br />and you are willing to swear
24882775 24886043 that you could distinguish<br />the voice of...

24891217 24892750 No further questions.
24895955 24897855 JANET: Ach, maybe<br />you could help me,<br />your Lordship.
24897890 24900424 Six months ago, I applied<br />for my hearing aid
24900459 24902426 and I'm still<br />waiting for it!

24907733 24909533 you are missing<br />very little.

24957783 24959583 I now call<br />the final witness<br />for the prosecution,
24959618 24961252 Christine Helm.
24961287 24962620 USHER: Christine Helm.
24962655 24963921 POLICEMAN 1:<br />Christine Helm.
24963956 24965523 POLICEMAN 2:<br />Christine Helm.
24976168 24977335 Christine!
24989348 24992316 I swear by almighty God,<br />that the evidence I shall give
24992351 24995786 shall be the truth,<br />the whole truth<br />and nothing but the truth.
24995821 24998956 My Lord, I have the most<br />serious objection
24998991 25001125 to this witness<br />being summoned<br />by the prosecution,
25001160 25002793 as she is the wife<br />of the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole.
25002828 25005162 My Lord, I call<br />my learned friend's attention
25005197 25009633 to the fact that<br />I summoned not Mrs. Vole,<br />but Mrs. Helm.
25009668 25011836 Your name, in fact,<br />is Christine Helm?
25011871 25013971 Yes, Christine Helm.
25014006 25015973 And you have been<br />living as the wife
25016008 25018542 of the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole?<br />CHRISTINE: Yes.
25018577 25020478 Are you actually<br />his wife?
25020513 25022847 No.
25022882 25025716 I went through<br />a marriage ceremony<br />with him in Hamburg,
25025751 25027985 but I already<br />had a husband.<br />He's still alive.
25028020 25030154 Christine, that's not true!
25030189 25031822 My Lord, there is proof<br />of a marriage
25031857 25033724 between the witness<br />and the prisoner.
25033759 25036827 But is there any proof<br />of a so-called<br />previous marriage?
25036862 25039997 My Lord, the so-called<br />previous marriage
25040032 25042166 is, in fact,<br />well documented.
25042201 25043534 Mrs. Helm,
25043569 25045336 is this a certificate<br />of marriage
25045371 25048906 between yourself and<br />one Otto Ludwig Helm?
25048941 25053544 The ceremony having<br />taken place in Breslau<br />on April 18, 1942?
25053579 25056380 Yes, that is the paper<br />of my marriage.
25056415 25059016 I don't see any reason<br />why this witness
25059051 25061052 should not be qualified<br />to give evidence.
25066425 25068692 Uh, Mrs. Helm, are you willing<br />to give evidence
25068727 25070761 against the man you've been<br />calling your husband?
25070796 25073197 Yes.
25073232 25074865 You stated to the police<br />that on the night
25074900 25077034 that Mrs. French was murdered,
25077069 25079103 Leonard Vole left the house<br />at 7:30
25079138 25082406 and returned at 9:25.
25082441 25084809 Did he, in fact,<br />return at 9:25?
25086479 25087745 No.
25087780 25089580 He returned at 10:10.
25089615 25091415 Christine,<br />what are you saying?
25091450 25094084 It's not true!<br />You know it's not true!
25094119 25095920 (CROWD MURMURING)
25098257 25100224 USHER: Silence!
25100259 25101759 I must have silence.
25103929 25105896 As your counsel<br />will tell you, Vole,
25105931 25108098 you will very shortly<br />have an opportunity
25108133 25110301 of speaking<br />in your own defense.
25110336 25113971 Leonard Vole returned,<br />you say, at 10:10.
25114006 25115773 And what happened next?
25115808 25118075 He was breathing hard,<br />very excited.
25118110 25120811 He threw off his coat<br />and examined the sleeves.
25120846 25122913 Then he told me<br />to wash the cuffs.
25122948 25124248 They had blood on them.
25124283 25125749 MYERS: Go on.
25125784 25127251 I said, "Leonard,<br />what have you done?"
25127286 25128819 And what did the prisoner<br />say to that?
25128854 25131088 He said, "I've killed her."
25131123 25132756 Christine, why are you lying?
25132791 25134492 Why are you saying<br />these things?
25134527 25135659 (CROWD MURMURING)
25135694 25137428 What an awful woman.
25137463 25139763 Oh, she's evil, that one.<br />I've known it all along.
25139798 25143100 (CROWD MURMURING)
25143135 25146770 If the defense so desires,<br />I will adjourn<br />for a short time
25146805 25149940 so that the prisoner<br />may gain control of himself.
25149975 25151442 My Lord is most gracious,
25151477 25153777 but pray let<br />the witness continue.
25153812 25155946 We are all of us caught up<br />in the suspense
25155981 25158148 of this horror fiction.
25158183 25162119 To have to hear it<br />in installments<br />might prove unendurable.
25162154 25163787 JUDGE: Proceed, Mr. Myers.
25163822 25165623 Uh, Mrs. Helm,
25165658 25168492 when the prisoner said,<br />"I have killed her,"
25168527 25170661 did you know<br />to whom he referred?
25170696 25172796 It was that woman<br />he had been going<br />to see so often.
25172831 25174865 Now then, when questioned<br />by the police,
25174900 25178035 you told them<br />that the prisoner<br />returned at 9:25?
25178070 25180638 Yes, because Leonard<br />asked me to say that.
25180673 25182973 MYERS: But you've changed<br />your story now. Why?
25183008 25185175 CHRISTINE:<br />I cannot go on lying<br />to save him.
25185210 25188812 I said to the police<br />what he wanted me to say<br />because I'm grateful to him.
25188847 25191515 He married me<br />and brought me<br />to this country.
25191550 25194985 What he has asked me to do,<br />I've always done<br />because I was grateful.
25195020 25197821 It was not because<br />he was your husband<br />and you loved him?
25197856 25200224 I never loved him.
25200259 25202493 MYERS: It was gratitude<br />to the prisoner, then,
25202528 25204995 that prompted you to give him<br />an alibi in your statement<br />to the police?
25205030 25207031 That is it, exactly.
25207066 25209166 But now you think<br />it was wrong to do so?
25209201 25210868 Because it is murder.
25210903 25213203 That woman,<br />she was a harmless old fool,
25213238 25215739 and he makes of me<br />an accomplice<br />to the murder.
25215774 25217841 I cannot come into court<br />and swear
25217876 25219677 that he was with me<br />at the time<br />when it was done.
25219712 25221078 I cannot do it!
25221113 25222680 I cannot do it!
25222715 25225015 Then this is the truth,
25225050 25228686 that Leonard Vole returned<br />that night at 10:10,
25228721 25230721 that he had blood<br />on the sleeves of his coat,
25230756 25232856 and that he said to you,
25232891 25234559 "I have killed her"?
25236595 25238429 That is the truth.
25238464 25240898 MYERS: That is the truth<br />before God?
25241767 25243401 That is the truth.
25244470 25245736 Thank you.
25251610 25253877 Mrs. Vole
25253912 25255379 or Mrs. Helm,<br />which do you prefer<br />to be called?
25255414 25256580 CHRISTINE: It does not matter.
25256615 25257915 Does it not?
25257950 25259717 In this country,<br />we are inclined
25259752 25261752 to take a rather more serious<br />view of marriage.
25261787 25265222 However, <i>Frau</i> Helm,<br />it would appear
25265257 25267257 that when you first met<br />the prisoner in Hamburg,
25267292 25270094 you lied to him<br />about your marital status?
25270129 25271929 I wanted to get out<br />of Germany, so...
25271964 25273097 WILFRID:<br />You lied, did you not?
25273132 25274465 Just yes or no, please.
25274500 25275733 Yes.
25275768 25277401 Thank you.
25277436 25279069 Then subsequently,<br />in arranging the marriage,
25279104 25280738 you lied to the authorities?
25280773 25283273 I, um, did not tell the truth<br />to the authorities.
25283308 25284575 You lied to them?
25284610 25286276 Yes.
25286311 25287911 And in the ceremony<br />of marriage itself,
25287946 25289580 when you swore<br />to love and to honor
25289615 25291448 and to cherish your husband,<br />that too was a lie?
25291483 25293651 CHRISTINE: Yes.
25293686 25296654 And when the police<br />questioned you<br />about this wretched man
25296689 25299590 who believes himself<br />married and loved,<br />you told them...
25299625 25301759 I told them what Leonard<br />wanted me to say.
25301794 25305596 You told them<br />that he was at home<br />with you at 9:25,
25305631 25308132 and now you say<br />that that was a lie?
25308167 25310634 Yes, a lie.
25310669 25314104 And when you said<br />that he had accidentally cut<br />his wrist, again you lied?
25314139 25316440 Yes!
25316475 25319643 (CHUCKLING)<br />And now today you've told us<br />a new story entirely.
25319678 25322946 The question is, <i>Frau</i> Helm,<br />were you lying then,<br />are you lying now?
25322981 25326784 Or are you not, in fact,<br />a chronic and habitual liar?
25326819 25328653 (CROWD MURMURING)
25329555 25331822 (COUGHING)
25331857 25335125 (WHISPERING) Carter. Carter.<br />The other pill,<br />under the tongue.
25335160 25337294 My Lord, is my learned friend<br />to be allowed
25337329 25339363 to bully and insult<br />the witness<br />in this fashion?
25339398 25341999 Mr. Myers,<br />this is a capital charge,
25342034 25343967 and within the bounds<br />of reason,
25344002 25347004 I should like the defense<br />to have every latitude.
25351043 25353811 My Lord, may I also remind<br />my learned friend
25353846 25355813 that his witness,<br />by her own admission,
25355848 25358015 has already violated<br />so many oaths,
25358050 25361885 that I am surprised<br />the testament did not leap<br />from her hand
25361920 25364488 when she was sworn here today!
25364523 25366557 I doubt if anything<br />is to be gained
25366592 25369026 by questioning you<br />any further.
25369061 25371528 That will be all, <i>Frau</i> Helm.
25371563 25373564 (CROWD MURMURING)
25376235 25378168 Mrs. Helm, I presume<br />you know the meaning
25378203 25380671 of the English word "perjury"?
25380706 25382673 In German,<br />the word is <i>"Meineid."</i>
25382708 25384374 Yes, <i>Meineid.</i>
25384409 25387010 It means to swear<br />falsely under oath.
25387045 25388679 And are you aware,<br />Mrs. Helm,
25388714 25390881 that the penalty<br />in this country for perjury
25390916 25393584 is a heavy term<br />of imprisonment?
25393619 25396053 CHRISTINE: Yes, I'm aware.
25396088 25398355 Mindful of this fact,
25398390 25401191 I ask you once more,<br />is the evidence<br />that you have given,
25401226 25404728 the truth, the whole truth<br />and nothing but the truth?
25404763 25408031 So help me, God.
25408066 25410901 Then that, My Lord,<br />is the case<br />for the prosecution.
25427486 25428753 (CRYING)
25429755 25431722 Oh, want a tissue?
25431757 25434124 Yes, thanks.
25434159 25436760 It's the first murder trial<br />I've ever been to.
25436795 25438729 It's terrible.
25438764 25440131 USHER: Silence!
25442467 25445269 Sir Wilfrid, are you ready<br />for the defense?
25447973 25449640 My Lord,
25449675 25452109 members of the jury,
25452144 25454578 the prosecution has<br />very ably presented
25454613 25457648 against the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole,
25457683 25461919 a case with the most<br />overwhelming<br />circumstantial evidence.
25461954 25463921 Among the witnesses,<br />you have heard
25463956 25466156 Chief Inspector Hearne,
25466191 25468325 who has given<br />his testimony in a fair<br />and impartial manner,
25468360 25470761 as he always does<br />in these cases.
25470796 25472796 He has evolved<br />and put before you
25472831 25475766 a clever theory of how<br />this crime was committed.
25475801 25477301 Whether it is theory
25477336 25479937 or actual fact, however,
25479972 25483607 you will decide<br />for yourselves.
25483642 25486677 And then you have heard<br />the evidence<br />of Janet McKenzie.
25486712 25488679 A worthy and devoted<br />housekeeper
25488714 25491114 who has suffered<br />two most grievous losses,
25491149 25493283 one, the death<br />of her beloved mistress
25493318 25495452 and second,
25495487 25499356 in being deprived<br />of an inheritance<br />of 80,000 pounds,
25499391 25502292 which she'd fully<br />expected to receive.
25502327 25507197 I will not comment further<br />on her evidence,
25507232 25511134 but will express only<br />my deepest sympathy for her
25511169 25514838 in both these mishaps.
25514873 25518642 And finally,<br />most damaging of all,
25518677 25520711 the prosecution has produced<br />a surprise witness,
25520746 25523180 one Christine Helm,
25523215 25525816 whom the prisoner married<br />and brought from the rubble<br />of her homeland
25525851 25527517 to the safety of this country,
25527552 25530354 giving her his love and<br />the protection of his name.
25530389 25532222 I objected to her testimony
25532257 25534157 because a wife cannot<br />give evidence
25534192 25536860 harmful to her husband.
25536895 25538862 But it has been proven
25538897 25542399 that her marriage<br />to Leonard Vole was fraudulent
25542434 25543667 and bigamous.
25543702 25545669 Therefore,
25545704 25548906 her evidence must be admitted<br />and you must consider it
25550042 25552376 for what it is worth.
25554713 25556413 Such is<br />the prosecution's case.
25556448 25559182 Now it is the turn<br />of the defense.
25559217 25561551 We could present,<br />on behalf of the prisoner,
25561586 25564755 a variety of witnesses<br />to his character,<br />his war record,
25564790 25567391 the lack of criminal<br />or evil association<br />in his past.
25567426 25569092 However,
25569127 25573096 only one witness<br />can shed new light
25573131 25575766 on this tragic riddle.
25577135 25578936 The prisoner himself.
25580772 25582873 Members of the jury,
25582908 25586277 I call Leonard Stephen Vole.
25605931 25608632 I swear by almighty God<br />that the evidence I shall give
25608667 25611301 will be the truth,<br />the whole truth<br />and nothing but the truth.
25611336 25613603 No.
25613638 25616606 Is your name<br />Leonard Stephen Vole?
25616641 25617808 It is.
25617843 25619576 WILFRID: Where do you live?
25619611 25621745 620, Edgware road.
25621780 25624915 Leonard Stephen Vole,<br />did you or did you not,
25624950 25629486 on the night of<br />October the 14th last,<br />murder Emily Jane French?
25629521 25630821 I did not.
25630856 25633423 Thank you. That will be all.
25633458 25635959 (CROWD MURMURING)
25635994 25640263 Have you, in fact,<br />concluded your examination<br />of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?
25640298 25642799 My Lord, the prisoner<br />has endured three days
25642834 25645268 of the most profound<br />mental agony and shock.
25645303 25647637 The defense feels<br />that his faculties
25647672 25649606 should be spared<br />for the cross-examination
25649641 25651942 by my learned friend<br />for the prosecution.
25651977 25654845 This is not a plea<br />for any indulgence.
25654880 25658148 I am confident that no matter<br />how searching this may be,
25658183 25660317 the prisoner<br />will withstand it.
25662721 25664654 Mr. Vole, at the time<br />that you made the acquaintance
25664689 25667024 of Mrs. French,<br />were you employed?<br />No, sir.
25667059 25669459 How much money did you have?<br />Just a few pounds.
25669494 25671695 Did she ever give you<br />any money?<br />No, not a penny.
25671730 25673830 Did you expect to receive any?<br />No, sir.
25673865 25675999 And did you know<br />that in her new will,
25676034 25678802 you were the beneficiary<br />to the extent<br />of 80,000 pounds?
25678837 25680670 No, I didn't.
25680705 25682973 Now, Mr. Vole, when you went<br />to visit Mrs. French
25683008 25685475 for the last time,
25685510 25687845 did you wear a trench coat<br />and a brown hat?
25689548 25690814 Yes, I did.
25690849 25692850 Was it this coat and hat?
25694586 25696486 Yes, sir.
25696521 25698655 My Lord, the defense,<br />leaving no stone unturned
25698690 25701358 in its efforts to establish<br />an alibi for the prisoner,
25701393 25704661 circulated this photograph,<br />hoping to bring forth<br />a witness
25704696 25707164 who had seen him leaving<br />Mrs. French's house
25707199 25710867 or entering his own<br />at the times<br />that he has stated.
25710902 25714538 Apparently, this splendid<br />effort was without results.
25714573 25716673 However, the defense<br />will be pleased to learn
25716708 25720177 that at the last moment,<br />a witness has come forward,
25720212 25722212 and that the prisoner<br />had been seen
25722247 25725348 wearing this coat<br />and this hat.
25725383 25728051 Lamentably,<br />he had not been seen<br />on the night of the murder,
25728086 25730520 but exactly one week before.
25730555 25732722 On the afternoon<br />of October the eighth,
25732757 25735358 were you or were you not<br />in a travel agency<br />on Regent Street?
25735393 25737194 And did you or did you not<br />make inquiries
25737229 25739096 about prices and schedules<br />of foreign cruises?
25739131 25741098 Well, supposing I did?
25741133 25742532 That's not a crime, is it?
25742567 25744868 Not at all.<br />Many people go on a cruise
25744903 25746770 when they can afford<br />to pay for it.
25746805 25749873 But you couldn't pay for it,<br />could you, Mr. Vole?
25749908 25752075 Well, I--I was hard up.<br />I told you that.
25752110 25754244 And yet you came<br />to this particular<br />travel agency
25754279 25757214 with a clinging brunette.
25757249 25759382 "A clinging brunette,"<br />Mr. Myers?
25759417 25761051 (CROWD CHUCKLING)
25761086 25763053 My Lord, the young lady<br />was so described to me.
25763088 25765055 She was very affectionate<br />with the prisoner,
25765090 25767224 constantly clinging<br />to his arm.
25767259 25768125 Oh.
25769995 25771761 You then admit<br />that you made inquiries
25771796 25774764 about the most expensive<br />and luxurious cruises.
25774799 25777067 How did you expect<br />to pay for such a thing?
25777102 25778602 I don't know. It was...
25778637 25781071 If you don't know,<br />perhaps I can help you.
25781106 25783640 On the morning<br />of the very same day,<br />according to Mr. Stokes,
25783675 25786476 you heard Mrs. French<br />change her will, leaving you<br />the bulk of her money.
25786511 25789079 I didn't! I knew nothing<br />about the will!
25789114 25790981 And in the afternoon,<br />you started to make plans<br />to dispose of that money.
25791016 25793116 No! It was nothing<br />of the kind!
25793151 25794918 I was in a pub<br />and I met this girl.
25794953 25796653 I don't even remember<br />her name now.
25796688 25798655 And we had a couple of drinks<br />and walked out together.
25798690 25800090 And we passed<br />that display window
25800125 25801925 and saw those fancy posters,
25801960 25804661 all blue seas and palm trees,
25804696 25807264 Grecian isles<br />or some such place.
25807299 25810600 So we went in just for fun<br />and I started<br />asking for folders.
25810635 25812435 Well, the man gave me<br />a sort of a funny look,
25812470 25814437 because I did look<br />a bit shabby.
25814472 25816106 Well, anyway,<br />it irritated me,
25816141 25817774 so I kept asking<br />for the swankiest tours,
25817809 25819476 all de luxe and a cabin<br />on the boat deck,
25819511 25821278 but it was just<br />putting on an act.
25821313 25823613 An act?
25823648 25825682 You knew that<br />in a week you were going<br />to inherit 80,000 pounds.
25825717 25827851 No, it wasn't<br />that way at all!
25827886 25830287 It was make-believe<br />and childish, but...
25830322 25832522 It was fun<br />and I enjoyed it.
25832557 25835025 I never thought of<br />killing anyone<br />or of inheriting any money.
25835060 25837127 It was just<br />a remarkable coincidence
25837162 25839129 that Mrs. French<br />should be killed<br />only one week later?
25839164 25842199 I told you.<br />I didn't kill her!
25842234 25844634 Do you know any reason<br />why the witness,<br />Christine Helm,
25844669 25847370 should deliberately give<br />the evidence she has given<br />if it were not true?
25847405 25851141 No, I don't know<br />why my wife...
25851176 25854144 I don't even know why<br />I still call her my wife.
25854179 25856213 She must have been lying<br />or out of her mind.
25856248 25858982 She seemed remarkably sane<br />and self-possessed.
25859017 25861685 But insanity<br />is the only reason<br />that you can suggest?
25861720 25863887 I don't understand it.
25863922 25866156 Oh, God, what's happened?<br />What's changed her?
25866191 25868325 Very effective, I'm sure.
25868360 25870527 But in this court,<br />we deal with fact.
25870562 25873697 And the fact, Mr. Vole,<br />is that we have<br />only your word for it,
25873732 25876666 that you left<br />Mrs. French's house<br />at the time you say you did,
25876701 25879502 that you came home at 9:25,
25879537 25881705 and that you did not<br />go out again!
25881740 25885008 But somebody must have<br />seen me in the street<br />or going into the house.
25885043 25887177 One would<br />certainly think so.
25887212 25889346 But the only person<br />who did see you<br />come home that night
25889381 25891214 says that it was 10:10
25891249 25892682 and she says that<br />you had blood<br />on your hands.
25892717 25894251 I cut my wrist!
25894286 25896353 You cut your wrist<br />deliberately!
25896388 25898355 No, I didn't!<br />I didn't do anything,
25898390 25901057 but you make it sound<br />as though I did.<br />I can hear it myself.
25901092 25903059 MYERS: You came home<br />at 10:10?
25903094 25904361 No, I didn't.
25904396 25906062 You've got to believe me.
25906097 25907864 You've got to believe me!
25907899 25910367 You killed Emily French!
25910402 25912369 No, I didn't!<br />I didn't do it!
25912404 25913903 I didn't kill her!
25913938 25916606 I never killed anybody!
25916641 25918608 God, it's like a nightmare,
25918643 25920477 some ghastly, horrible dream.
25927085 25929552 Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.<br />How did it go today?
25929587 25931888 MAN: Oh, uh, Sir Wilfrid?
25931923 25934391 I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir,
25934426 25936793 and I brought<br />your bermuda shorts<br />for a fitting.
25937996 25939429 My what?
25939464 25941064 You better slip these on,<br />Sir Wilfrid,
25941099 25943099 if we're to have them<br />ready by tomorrow.
25943134 25944434 My dear man,<br />I'm in the middle<br />of a murder trial.
25944469 25946303 It'll all be over<br />by tomorrow afternoon
25946338 25948305 and the boat train<br />doesn't go until 9:40.
25948340 25950407 You two work it out.
25950442 25951908 You know my shape.<br />you've stabbed it<br />often enough.
25951943 25954477 Upstairs, Sir Wilfrid.<br />You need a lukewarm bath
25954512 25956079 and your calcium injection.
25956114 25958515 Oh, and there's a lot more<br />packing to be done still.
25960652 25962919 It's ridiculous having<br />those boat reservations.
25962954 25965588 How do we know?<br />The jury may be<br />out for days.
25965623 25967090 Not on this case,<br />I'm afraid.
25967125 25968658 It seems too open and shut.
25968693 25971928 (SIGHING)
25971963 25975598 I watched them when <i>Frau</i> Helm<br />was on the stand.<br />They didn't like her.
25975633 25977801 No, they didn't like her,<br />but they believed her.
25977836 25980003 They liked Leonard Vole,<br />but they didn't believe him.
25980038 25982339 And that travel agency<br />business doesn't help either.
25982374 25984307 Cigar, Wilfrid?<br />No.
25984342 25985942 Wilfrid, do you think<br />she lied?
25985977 25987177 Well, don't you?
25987212 25988611 I don't know.<br />I'm not sure.
25988646 25990113 I am. She lied.
25990148 25992482 Whether she called it <i>meineid</i><br />or perjury, she lied.
25992517 25994517 The only question<br />in my mind is, "Why?"
25994552 25997954 What's her game?<br />What is she up to?<br />What?
25997989 26000857 Sir Wilfrid, I hope that<br />in your final speech tomorrow,
26000892 26003460 you won't let yourself become<br />too emotionally involved.
26003495 26005662 You must think<br />of your physical condition.
26005697 26008465 He's right, you know.<br />I want to see you<br />save yourself.
26008500 26010033 This isn't going to be<br />your last case.
26010068 26011801 Yes, it is,
26011836 26013970 but until it's over,<br />I'm still a barrister.
26014005 26015638 And my client's life<br />is at stake.
26015673 26017807 That's all that matters.<br />His life.
26017842 26021311 He's entitled to the best<br />that I can do.
26021346 26024981 If I can't stand up to make<br />my final appeal for him,<br />I'll make it sitting down.
26025016 26027817 If I become short of breath,<br />I'll take a pill or two pills,
26027852 26029552 or all of them<br />and the box as well.
26029587 26030854 (TELEPHONE RINGING)

26088646 26090113 I'm at the booth here<br />at Euston Station
26090148 26092115 at the far end of the bar.
26092150 26093616 And I'll be here<br />for just 30 minutes,

26282674 26284741 Oh, she wrote them<br />all right.
26284776 26286610 It's all fair and square.
26289514 26291948 I hope they fix her<br />good and proper.
26294485 26298287 I've had messages<br />from Mrs. Vole.<br />It looks like her handwriting.
26298322 26300623 Good heavens,<br />look at this.
26300658 26302125 (STEAM ENGINE WHISTLING)
26303461 26305595 Juicy, ain't they?
26305630 26307797 There's one coming up<br />that's even better.
26307832 26310266 How did you get<br />hold of these?
26310301 26312935 What difference does it make,<br />so long as she gets<br />what's coming to her?
26312970 26314637 What have you<br />got against her?
26314672 26316606 Ha!
26316641 26319275 I'll give you something<br />to dream about, mister.

26320511 26322479 Want to kiss me, ducky?
26326818 26329452 Ha! I didn't suppose<br />you would.
26329487 26331621 Christine Vole did that<br />to you?
26331656 26333122 Not her.
26333157 26334691 The chap I was going with.
26334726 26337293 He was a bit younger than me,<br />but I loved him.
26337328 26339495 And then she come along,<br />started seeing him<br />on the sly,
26339530 26342131 and then one day<br />he cleared out.
26342166 26344500 But I went after him<br />and I found them together.
26344535 26347637 I told him what<br />I thought of her and he cut<br />me face up proper.
26347672 26349505 Did you go to the police<br />about it?
26349540 26351974 Who, me? Not likely.
26352009 26354677 Besides,<br />it wasn't his fault,<br />not really. It was hers.
26354712 26358147 It was all hers.<br />Getting him away from me,<br />turning him against me.
26358182 26361017 But I waited me time<br />to pay her back.
26361052 26363019 And it's come now.
26363054 26365388 I'm deeply sorry,<br />deeply sorry.
26365423 26368391 We'll make it another 5 pounds<br />for the letters.

26370561 26372862 I knew I was being<br />too soft with you.
26372897 26374530 Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
26374565 26376032 Read this one.<br />Hmm?
26378269 26381237 Unbelievable.
26381272 26384340 We'd better have the full name<br />of the man to whom<br />these were addressed.

26449340 26452408 Since the defense<br />has called but one witness,<br />the prisoner,
26452443 26455278 it has the right<br />to be heard last.
26455313 26457580 Therefore, Mr. Myers,<br />if you are ready,
26457615 26461584 let us have the final address<br />for the prosecution.
26461619 26463753 My Lord,<br />members of the jury,
26463788 26466289 I will be brief<br />in my final speech
26466324 26469292 because I think that<br />the prosecution has proved<br />so obvious a case of murder
26469327 26471294 against the prisoner,<br />Leonard Vole,
26471329 26474964 that a verdict of guilty<br />must be the only<br />possible conclusion.
26474999 26476966 I will briefly summarize<br />these facts...
26477001 26478968 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
26482673 26484607 (PANTING)
26484642 26487443 JUDGE: You'd better begin<br />again, Mr. Myers.
26487478 26491781 That is, if Sir Wilfrid<br />is at all interested<br />in our proceedings.
26491816 26493616 I am indeed, My Lord.
26493651 26496485 The speech for the Crown,<br />however, is premature.
26496520 26499455 I ask that the case<br />for the defense<br />be reopened,
26499490 26501324 and that a witness<br />be recalled.
26501359 26503326 My Lord,<br />I must strenuously object
26503361 26505461 to the case being reopened<br />at this final stage.
26505496 26508798 Evidence of the most startling<br />nature came into my possession<br />only last night.
26508833 26510967 My Lord, the course<br />my learned friend proposes
26511002 26512468 is quite unprecedented.
26512503 26514003 I have anticipated<br />my friend's objection
26514038 26516372 and am prepared to meet it<br />with ample precedent.
26516407 26518474 There is first the case<br />of the King against Stillman,
26518509 26520509 reported in<br />the <i>Criminal Appeal Reports</i>
26520544 26524647 of 1926 at page 463.
26524682 26526716 Also, the King against Porter,
26526751 26528985 in volume one of the<br /><i>King's Bench Division Reports,</i>
26529020 26532822 1942, at page 153.
26532857 26535658 And lastly, there is the case<br />of the King against Sullivan,
26535693 26537560 in which<br />this issue was raised,
26537595 26540029 which I am sure<br />Your Lordship will remember,
26540064 26542498 since your lordship appeared<br />for the prosecution.
26542533 26544400 JUDGE: I did?
26544435 26547503 Oh, yes,<br />before Mr. Justice Swindon.
26547538 26549672 Now, what is this new<br />evidence, Sir Wilfrid?
26549707 26552174 Letters, My Lord.
26552209 26554878 Letters written<br />by Christine Helm.
26557748 26561183 My Lord, the prosecution<br />continues its objection.
26561218 26563052 If my memory serves me well,
26563087 26564754 Your Lordship's<br />similar objection,
26564789 26567423 in the King against Sullivan,<br />was sustained.
26570594 26574196 Your memory, for once,<br />serves you ill, Mr. Myers.
26574231 26576198 My objection then<br />was overruled
26576233 26578768 by Mr. Justice Swindon,
26578803 26582238 as yours is now, by me.

26617508 26619241 Mrs. Helm,
26619276 26621911 you appreciate<br />you are still under oath?
26621946 26623779 Yes.
26623814 26626182 WILFRID: Mrs. Helm,<br />do you know a man named Max?
26627651 26628918 I don't know what you mean.
26628953 26630486 It's a simple question.
26630521 26632822 Do you or do you not know<br />a man called Max?
26632857 26634590 Max?
26634625 26636125 Certainly not.
26636160 26637593 It's a fairly common name<br />and yet you mean
26637628 26639996 you've never known a man<br />with the name of Max?
26640031 26642331 CHRISTINE:<br />Oh, in Germany, perhaps,<br />but that was a long time ago.
26642366 26646135 I shall not ask you<br />to go back that far,<br />just a few weeks to, uh,
26646170 26648638 October the 20th last.
26650641 26652441 What have you got there?
26652476 26653843 WILFRID: A letter.
26653878 26655978 I suggest that<br />on October the 20th,
26656013 26658114 you wrote a certain letter...
26658149 26659949 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
26659984 26661951 ...addressed to a man<br />named Max.
26661986 26664120 I did nothing of the sort!
26664155 26667023 The letter was but<br />one of a series written<br />to the same man.
26668159 26670459 Lies! All lies!
26670494 26672628 You would seem<br />to have been on,
26672663 26674797 well, let us say,<br />on intimate terms<br />with this man.
26674832 26677800 How dare you<br />say a thing like that?<br />It isn't true!
26677835 26680636 I'm not concerned<br />with the general trend<br />of this correspondence,
26680671 26683005 only with<br />one particular letter.
26683040 26685474 "My beloved Max,
26685509 26688377 "An extraordinary thing<br />has happened.
26688412 26691380 "I believe<br />all our difficulties<br />may be ended..."
26691415 26694050 I will not stand here<br />and listen<br />to a pack of lies.
26694085 26696152 That letter's a forgery.
26696187 26698054 It isn't even<br />my letter paper.
26698089 26700489 WILFRID: It isn't?<br />No.
26700524 26703926 I write my letters<br />on small, blue paper<br />with my initials on it.

26728252 26733022 Now, if you like,<br />I can have an expert<br />identify your handwriting.

26755079 26756378 Sir Wilfrid,
26756413 26758881 would you now read<br />the letter in question
26758916 26760917 so that the jury may hear it?
26766490 26769058 "My beloved Max,
26769093 26771961 "an extraordinary thing<br />has happened.

26781138 26784640 "His only hope of an alibi<br />depends on me,

26787778 26790913 "Suppose I testify
26790948 26794483 "that he was not<br />at home with me<br />at the time of the murder,
26794518 26797987 "that he came home<br />with blood on his sleeves,
26798022 26802291 "and that he even admitted<br />to me that he'd killed her.
26802326 26804260 "Strange, isn't it?<br />He always said
26804295 26805961 "that he would never<br />let me leave him,
26805996 26808497 "But now, if this succeeds,
26808532 26813802 "he will be leaving me<br />because they will<br />take him away forever.

26826684 26829719 Mrs. Helm, will you go<br />back to the witness box?
26840564 26843299 I now ask you again,<br />Christine Helm,
26843334 26845968 did you write<br />this letter?
26846003 26847970 Christine, tell him<br />that you didn't write it.
26848005 26849305 I know you didn't.
26849340 26850873 Please answer my question.
26850908 26853676 Did you write this letter?
26853711 26855477 Before answering, Mrs. Helm,
26855512 26858314 I wish to warn you that<br />the law regarding perjury
26858349 26860849 in this country<br />is very severe.
26860884 26864820 If you have already committed<br />perjury in this courtroom,
26864855 26868657 I strongly advise you<br />not to add to your crime.
26868692 26872361 But if this letter has not<br />been written by you,
26872396 26875364 then now is the time<br />to state this fact.
26878435 26879902 I wrote the letter.

26883707 26886876 Then that, My Lord,<br />is the case for the defense.
26894785 26896518 I keep asking myself,<br />Sir Wilfrid,
26896553 26898554 which is harder,<br />your head or your arteries?
26898589 26900723 You'd better stop<br />pressing your luck.<br />You're overdue now.
26900758 26902691 We're all packed<br />and ready, Doctor.
26902726 26904860 I hope the jury won't take<br />all the afternoon.

26913237 26914570 Why, what's wrong?
26914605 26916772 It's a little too neat,<br />too tidy,
26916807 26919041 and altogether<br />too symmetrical.

27112102 27113836 (CROWD CLAMORING)
27123780 27125414 WOMAN: A liar,<br />that's what you are!
27125449 27127749 Every word you said<br />was a lie!
27127784 27130285 MAN 1: People like you<br />ought to be locked up.<br />MAN 2: Liar!
27130320 27132455 You'd better wait here<br />until we get rid<br />of that crowd, madam.
27133690 27134824 Thank you.
27139363 27142798 Ready, sir?<br />Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.
27142833 27145434 Let me finish<br />the last of the cocoa
27145469 27148670 while I'm still<br />beyond her jurisdiction.
27148705 27151640 Would you excuse me,<br />Brogan-Moore, Carter?<br />Thank you.
27180003 27182504 I never thought you British<br />could get so emotional,
27182539 27184206 especially in a public place.
27184241 27186008 I apologize<br />for my compatriots.
27186043 27188377 Oh, it's all right.<br />I don't mind<br />being called names
27188412 27190812 or pushed around,<br />or even kicked in the shin.
27190847 27193215 But now I have a ladder<br />in my last pair of nylons.
27193250 27195817 In case you are not familiar<br />with our prison regulations,
27195852 27197553 no silk stockings.
27197588 27199821 Prison? Will I go to prison?
27199856 27202157 You heard the learned judge.
27202192 27204026 You will quite certainly<br />be charged with perjury,<br />tried for it,
27204061 27206495 and to prison you shall go.
27206530 27208330 Well, it won't be<br />for life, will it?
27208365 27211867 If I were appearing<br />for the prosecution,<br />it would be.
27211902 27213835 You loathe me, don't you?
27213870 27216004 Like the people outside.
27216039 27218206 What a wicked woman I am,
27218241 27220709 and how brilliantly<br />you exposed me<br />and saved Leonard's life.
27220744 27224179 The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts<br />did it again.
27224214 27225847 Well, let me<br />tell you something.
27225882 27227583 You didn't do it alone.
27227618 27229051 You had help.
27230921 27232588 What are you driving at?
27232623 27234256 I'm not driving<br />at anything anymore.
27234291 27236024 Leonard is free,<br />and we did it.
27236059 27237693 We?<br />Remember?
27237728 27239361 When I came to see you<br />and you that said no jury
27239396 27241363 would believe an alibi<br />given by a loving wife,
27241398 27243865 no matter how much she swore<br />her husband was innocent?
27243900 27245367 That gave me the idea.
27245402 27247202 What idea?
27247237 27248937 The idea that I should be<br />a witness,
27248972 27251239 not for my husband,
27251274 27253875 but for the prosecution,<br />that I should swear<br />Leonard was guilty
27253910 27256111 and that you should expose me<br />as a vicious liar,
27256146 27260415 because only then<br />would they believe<br />Leonard was innocent.
27260450 27262785 So now you know<br />the whole story,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
27269426 27273462 (IN COCKNEY ACCENT)<br />I'll give you something<br />to dream about, mister.
27273497 27275331 Wanna kiss me, ducky?
27280270 27283905 I suspected something,<br />but not that.
27283940 27285574 Never that.
27285609 27287442 Thank you for the compliment.
27287477 27289578 It's been a long time<br />since I was an actress,
27289613 27291146 and I never before played<br />such an important role.
27291181 27294316 And all those blue letters?
27294351 27296251 It took me hours<br />to write them, to invent Max.
27296286 27297986 There never was a Max.
27298021 27300589 There's never been anyone<br />but Leonard, only Leonard.
27300624 27302991 My dear, could you not<br />have trusted me,
27303026 27305293 worked with me<br />truthfully and honorably?
27305328 27307596 We would have won!
27307631 27309931 I could not run that risk.<br />You see, you thought<br />he was innocent.
27309966 27313468 And you knew<br />he was innocent,<br />I understand.
27313503 27316605 No, Sir Wilfrid,<br />you do not understand at all.
27316640 27318173 I knew he was guilty.
27322646 27324446 That can't be true!
27324481 27325314 No!
27326983 27329451 Listen to me once and for all.
27329486 27331186 Leonard came home<br />a few minutes past 10:00.
27331221 27332454 He did have blood<br />on his sleeves,
27332489 27333989 he did tell me<br />he had killed the woman.
27334024 27335624 Only I could save him.<br />He pleaded with me.
27335659 27336958 And you saved him.
27336993 27339127 A murderer?
27339162 27341029 Again, you don't understand.
27341064 27342331 I love him.
27349172 27351640 I told you she was an actress<br />and a good one.
27351675 27353475 CHRISTINE: Leonard.
27353510 27355310 I knew she was going<br />to do something for me,
27355345 27356712 but I just didn't know<br />what or how.
27356747 27358346 Leonard! Leonard!
27358381 27360682 (SIGHING)
27360717 27362317 Fooled you completely,<br />didn't she?
27362352 27364853 It was you, Vole,<br />who fooled me.
27365522 27366688 Oh!
27366723 27369991 Easy, easy.
27370026 27372160 Now, we both got<br />out of this alive.<br />Let's stay this way.
27372195 27373729 Where are your pills?
27373764 27375664 Vole, you have made<br />a mockery of English law.
27375699 27377999 Who did?
27378034 27379334 You got me off,<br />and I can't be tried<br />again for this.
27379369 27380736 That's English law, too,<br />isn't it?
27380771 27382337 You can't touch him now.
27382372 27384172 Nobody can.
27384207 27387008 The scales of justice<br />may tip one way or another,
27387043 27389878 but ultimately<br />they balance out.<br />You'll pay for this.
27389913 27392013 Oh, ultimately's<br />a long way off.
27392048 27394349 I'd rather pay for it<br />as soon as possible<br />and in cash.
27394384 27396585 Suppose we double your fee.
27396620 27399354 There'll be plenty of money<br />as soon as the will<br />goes through.
27399389 27402357 I'm not cheap.<br />I want everybody to get<br />something out of this.
27402392 27405761 Now, there's Janet McKenzie.<br />We'll get her<br />that new hearing aid.
27405796 27407429 And we'll get you<br />a new one of these.
27407464 27410732 18 karat gold,<br />if they make them.
27410767 27412901 When they try you<br />for perjury,
27412936 27414736 there'll be 5,000 pounds<br />for the best defense<br />you can get.
27414771 27416271 I don't care, Leonard,
27416306 27418240 just so we'll be<br />together again.
27418275 27420208 You don't know<br />what I went through,
27420243 27422043 standing in the witness box,<br />having to face you<br />in the dock,
27422078 27424713 saying I never loved you.
27424748 27426214 What is it, Leonard?
27426249 27427716 Sir Wilfrid,<br />the luggage is in the car
27427751 27430385 and we've only 20 minutes<br />to catch the boat train.
27430420 27432554 This is a nice young lady<br />I met in the gallery<br />during the trial.
27432589 27434923 Len! Oh, Len!
27439262 27441630 Oh, Len, they've been<br />trying to keep me<br />away from you.
27441665 27443131 It's had me nearly crazy.
27443166 27445734 Leonard,<br />who is this girl?
27445769 27448470 I'm not "This girl."<br />I'm his girl.
27448505 27450806 Tell her, Len.
27450841 27454242 Leonard, is this the girl<br />who was with you<br />in the travel bureau?
27454277 27457445 The girl you said<br />you hardly knew,<br />didn't even know her name?
27457480 27459080 That's right.
27459115 27461750 That's who I am,<br />and I know all about you.
27461785 27465487 You're not his wife,<br />never have been.<br />You're years older than he is.
27465522 27466822 We've been going<br />together for months,
27466857 27468924 and we're going away<br />on one of those cruises,
27468959 27471827 just like they said in court.<br />Tell her yourself, Len.
27472495 27474129 Yes, Len.
27474164 27476431 Tell me yourself.
27476466 27478433 All right, Diana.<br />Come along.
27478468 27480836 You can't, Leonard.<br />Not after what I've done.<br />I won't let you.
27480871 27483839 Don't be silly.<br />I saved your life<br />getting you out of Germany.
27483874 27485974 You saved mine getting me<br />out of this mess.
27486009 27488009 So we're even.<br />It's all over now.<br />Don't, Leonard!
27488044 27489344 Don't leave me!
27489379 27491613 (SHUSHING)<br />Don't, Leonard, don't!
27491648 27493481 Pull yourself together.
27493516 27494850 They'll have you up here<br />for perjury.
27494885 27496318 Well, don't make it worse
27496353 27499487 or they'll try you<br />as an accessory.
27499522 27501857 And you know what that means.
27501892 27503625 CHRISTINE: I don't care.<br />Let them.
27503660 27507295 Let them try me for perjury<br />or an accessory or...
27507330 27509130 LEONARD: Ready?<br />Or better yet...
27509165 27510365 (PANTING)
27510400 27512367 Let them try me for...
27512402 27513669 (GRUNTS)
27517507 27519575 (DIANA SCREAMING)
27521011 27522678 (DIANA SOBBING)
27535859 27538026 Call a doctor.
27538061 27540229 It's no use.<br />No doctor can help now.
27541531 27542731 What happened?
27542766 27543865 She killed him.
27543900 27544933 Killed him?
27546036 27547936 She executed him.
27550106 27552507 Carter, what have you done<br />with the luggage?
27552542 27554342 I--I sent it on ahead<br />to the station
27554377 27556445 and I've got a cab<br />waiting outside.
27565388 27567522 A remarkable woman.
27567557 27569257 You can just barely<br />catch the boat train,<br />Sir Wilfrid.
27569292 27570859 Better bring<br />the luggage back
27570894 27572761 and you can dismiss the cab.
27572796 27574596 We are not going yet,
27574631 27575898 are we?
27578435 27581770 Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
27581805 27584706 Get Brogan-Moore<br />to my chambers<br />and have Mayhew there, too.
27584741 27587910 We're appearing<br />for the defense in the trial<br />of Christine Vole.
27588745 27590578 Sir Wilfrid.
27590613 27592581 You've forgotten<br />your brandy.
