857695 858994 SUPPOSE YOU RUN<br />YOUR BUSINESS,
859063 860295 AND LET ME RUN MINE.
860364 863465 SUPPOSE WE ASK SAM.<br />MAYBE HE'D LIKE A CHANGE.
863534 864934 SUPPOSE WE DO.
865003 867936 WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE<br />THAT IN THIS WORLD TODAY,
868005 870338 ISOLATIONISM IS NO LONGER<br />A PRACTICAL POLICY?
870407 872941 SAM, FERRARI WANTS YOU<br />TO WORK FOR HIM.
873010 874342 I LIKE IT FINE HERE.
874411 875778 HE'LL DOUBLE<br />WHAT I PAY YOU.
875847 876946 YEAH,<br />BUT I AIN'T GOT TIME
877015 877813 TO SPEND THE MONEY<br />I MAKE HERE.
877882 879451 SORRY.
883054 885120 BOSS' PRIVATE STOCK...
885189 887323 BECAUSE, YVONNE,<br />I LOVE YOU.
887392 888857 OH, SHUT UP.
888926 891126 ALL RIGHT. FOR YOU,<br />I SHUT UP...
891195 893562 BECAUSE, YVONNE,<br />I LOVE YOU.
893631 894696 UH-OH.
894765 898329 SOME GERMANS<br />GAVE THIS CHECK.
898398 900372 IS IT ALL RIGHT?
903808 905540 WHERE WERE YOU<br />LAST NIGHT?
905609 908744 THAT'S SO LONG AGO,<br />I DON'T REMEMBER.
908813 910746 WILL I SEE YOU<br />TONIGHT?
910815 913483 I NEVER MAKE PLANS<br />THAT FAR AHEAD.
913552 914850 GIVE ME ANOTHER.
914919 916251 SACHA,<br />SHE'S HAD ENOUGH.
916320 918749 DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.<br />FILL IT UP.
918818 920188 YVONNE, I LOVE YOU,<br />BUT HE PAYS ME.
920257 921757 RICK, I'M SICK AND TIRED<br />OF HAVING YOU--
921826 923158 SACHA, CALL A CAB.
923227 925861 LET'S GET YOUR COAT.<br />YOU'RE GOING HOME.
925930 928233 YOU'VE HAD A LITTLE<br />TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
930568 932500 HEY, TAXI.
932569 935436 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU<br />ARE, PUSHING ME AROUND?
935505 937572 I WAS A FOOL TO FALL<br />FOR A MAN LIKE YOU.
937641 940810 MAKE SURE SHE GETS HOME...<br />AND COME RIGHT BACK.
940878 942414 YES, BOSS.
954058 954990 HELLO, RICK.
955059 956425 HELLO, LOUIS.
956494 958894 HOW EXTRAVAGANT YOU ARE,<br />THROWING AWAY WOMEN LIKE THAT.
958963 960395 SOMEDAY THEY MAY<br />BE SCARCE.
960464 963698 I THINK I'LL CALL ON YVONNE,<br />MAYBE GET HER ON THE REBOUND.
963767 967069 WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN,<br />YOU'RE A TRUE DEMOCRAT.
967138 969274 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
976613 978814 IF HE GETS A WORD IN,
978883 981486 IT'LL BE A MAJOR<br />ITALIAN VICTORY.
984588 986591 THE PLANE TO LISBON.
990727 993194 YOU WOULD LIKE<br />TO BE ON IT.
993263 994930 WHY?<br />WHAT'S IN LISBON?
994999 996597 THE CLIPPER TO AMERICA.
996666 999601 I'VE OFTEN SPECULATED<br />ON WHY YOU DON'T RETURN.
999670 1001937 DID YOU ABSCOND<br />WITH THE CHURCH FUNDS?
1002006 1003604 DID YOU RUN OFF WITH<br />A SENATOR'S WIFE?
1003673 1006809 I'D LIKE TO THINK<br />THAT YOU KILLED A MAN.
1006878 1008143 IT'S THE ROMANTIC<br />IN ME.
1008212 1009478 IT'S A COMBINATION<br />OF ALL 3.
1009547 1010713 WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME<br />BROUGHT YOU TO CASABLANCA?
1010782 1011842 MY HEALTH.
1011911 1014082 I CAME TO CASABLANCA<br />FOR THE WATERS.
1014151 1018186 THE WATERS? WHAT WATERS?<br />WE'RE IN THE DESERT.
1018255 1020525 I WAS MISINFORMED.
1022193 1023391 EXCUSE ME,<br />MONSIEUR RICK.
1023460 1026394 A GENTLEMAN INSIDE<br />HAS WON 20,000 FRANCS,
1026463 1029798 AND THE CASHIER<br />WOULD LIKE SOME MONEY.
1029867 1032201 I'LL GET IT<br />FROM THE SAFE.
1032270 1034203 I'M SO UPSET, MONSIEUR RICK.
1034272 1035938 FORGET IT, EMIL.
1036007 1037239 THINGS LIKE THAT<br />HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.
1037308 1038674 I'M AWFULLY SORRY.
1038743 1040612 [PLAYING<i> BABY FACE]</i>
1041778 1044712 THERE'S GOING TO BE<br />SOME EXCITEMENT TONIGHT.
1044781 1047916 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE<br />AN ARREST IN YOUR CAFE.
1047985 1049084 WHAT, AGAIN?
1049153 1050719 THIS IS<br />NO ORDINARY ARREST.
1050788 1052087 A MURDERER, NO LESS.
1052156 1053255 IF YOU'RE THINKING<br />OF WARNING HIM,
1053324 1054322 DON'T<br />PUT YOURSELF OUT.
1054391 1055924 HE CANNOT POSSIBLY<br />ESCAPE.
1055993 1058227 I STICK MY NECK OUT<br />FOR NOBODY.
1058296 1060228 A WISE FOREIGN POLICY.
1060297 1062998 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
1063067 1064332 WE COULD'VE<br />MADE THIS ARREST
1064401 1065767 EARLIER THIS EVENING<br />AT THE BLUE PARROT.
1065836 1068971 OUT OF MY REGARD FOR YOU,<br />WE'RE STAGING IT HERE.
1069040 1070839 IT WILL AMUSE<br />YOUR CUSTOMERS.
1070908 1072507 OUR ENTERTAINMENT'S<br />ENOUGH.
1072576 1075110 WE'LL HAVE AN IMPORTANT<br />GUEST HERE TONIGHT,
1075179 1077378 MAJOR STRASSER<br />OF THE THIRD REICH, NO LESS.
1077447 1080081 WE WANT HIM TO BE HERE<br />WHEN WE MAKE THE ARREST.
1080150 1081751 A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION<br />OF THE EFFICIENCY
1081820 1082851 OF MY ADMINISTRATION.
1082920 1084352 WHAT'S STRASSER<br />DOING HERE?
1084421 1086354 HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T<br />COME TO CASABLANCA
1086423 1087923 TO WITNESS<br />A DEMONSTRATION
1087992 1089191 OF YOUR EFFICIENCY.
1089260 1090158 PERHAPS NOT.
1090227 1091794 IT SHALL NOT<br />HAPPEN AGAIN.
1091863 1092995 IT'S ALL RIGHT.
1093064 1094229 LOUIS, SOMETHING'S<br />ON YOUR MIND.
1094298 1096031 WHY DON'T YOU<br />SPILL IT?
1096100 1097199 HOW OBSERVANT YOU ARE.
1097268 1100335 I WANTED TO GIVE YOU<br />A WORD OF ADVICE.
1100404 1102204 YEAH?<br />HAVE A BRANDY?
1102273 1103605 THANK YOU.
1103674 1106607 THERE ARE MANY EXIT VISAS<br />SOLD IN THIS CAFE,
1106676 1109311 BUT WE KNOW<br />YOU'VE NEVER SOLD ONE.
1109380 1111613 THAT IS THE REASON<br />WE PERMIT YOU TO REMAIN OPEN.
1111682 1115317 I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE<br />I LET YOU WIN AT ROULETTE.
1115386 1116718 THAT IS ANOTHER REASON.
1116787 1119454 A MAN ARRIVED IN CASABLANCA<br />ON HIS WAY TO AMERICA.
1119523 1120688 HE'LL OFFER A FORTUNE<br />TO ANYONE
1120757 1122224 WHO WILL FURNISH HIM<br />WITH AN EXIT VISA.
1122293 1123520 WHAT'S HIS NAME?
1123589 1124960 VICTOR LASZLO.
1125029 1126428 VICTOR LASZLO?
1126497 1128230 THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE<br />EVER SEEN YOU SO IMPRESSED.
1128299 1129731 WELL, HE'S IMPRESSED<br />HALF THE WORLD.
1129800 1133568 IT'S MY DUTY TO SEE HE DOESN'T<br />IMPRESS THE OTHER HALF.
1133637 1135237 RICK, LASZLO MUST NEVER<br />REACH AMERICA.
1135306 1136638 HE STAYS IN CASABLANCA.
1136707 1139841 IT WILL BE INTERESTING<br />TO SEE HOW HE MANAGES.
1139910 1140943 MANAGES WHAT?
1141012 1141944 HIS ESCAPE.
1142013 1143344 BUT I TOLD YOU--
1143413 1145075 STOP IT. SINCE HIS ESCAPE<br />FROM A CONCENTRATION CAMP,
1145144 1147482 THE NAZIS HAVE CHASED HIM<br />ALL OVER EUROPE.
1147551 1150118 THIS IS THE END<br />OF THE CHASE.
1150187 1152121 20,000 FRANCS<br />SAYS IT ISN'T.
1152190 1154222 IS THAT<br />A SERIOUS OFFER?
1154291 1156959 I JUST PAID OUT 20.<br />I'D LIKE IT BACK.
1157028 1158126 MAKE IT 10.
1158195 1160863 I'M ONLY A POOR,<br />CORRUPT OFFICIAL.
1160932 1162063 OK.
1162132 1163965 DONE. NO MATTER<br />HOW CLEVER HE IS,
1164034 1165366 HE STILL NEEDS<br />AN EXIT VISA.
1165435 1166468 I SHOULD SAY 2.<br />WHY 2?
1166537 1167970 HE'S TRAVELING<br />WITH A LADY.
1168039 1169972 HE'LL TAKE ONE.
1170041 1171473 I THINK NOT.<br />I'VE SEEN THE LADY.
1171542 1174143 IF HE DIDN'T LEAVE<br />HER IN MARSEILLES,
1174212 1176844 HE CERTAINLY WON'T<br />LEAVE HER IN CASABLANCA.
1176913 1179347 MAYBE HE'S NOT QUITE<br />AS ROMANTIC AS YOU ARE.
1179416 1180548 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
1180617 1182650 THERE'S NO EXIT VISA<br />FOR HIM.
1182719 1184253 WHATEVER GAVE YOU<br />THE IMPRESSION
1184322 1186921 THAT I'D BE INTERESTED<br />IN HELPING LASZLO ESCAPE?
1186990 1190125 BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT<br />UNDER THAT CYNICAL SHELL,
1190194 1192360 YOU'RE AT HEART<br />A SENTIMENTALIST.
1192429 1193762 LAUGH IF YOU WILL,
1193831 1196365 BUT I'M FAMILIAR<br />WITH YOUR RECORD.
1196434 1198466 LET ME POINT OUT<br />JUST 2 ITEMS.
1198535 1202237 IN 1935, YOU RAN GUNS<br />TO ETHIOPIA.
1202306 1205340 IN 1936,<br />YOU FOUGHT IN SPAIN
1205409 1206641 ON THE LOYALIST SIDE.
1206710 1209278 I GOT WELL PAID FOR IT<br />ON BOTH OCCASIONS.
1209347 1210612 THE WINNING SIDE
1210681 1211847 WOULD HAVE PAID YOU<br />MUCH BETTER.
1211916 1212948 MAYBE.
1213017 1216385 IT SEEMS YOU'RE DETERMINED<br />TO KEEP LASZLO HERE.
1216454 1219021 I HAVE MY ORDERS.
1219090 1221023 I SEE. GESTAPO SPANK.
1221092 1222725 YOU OVERESTIMATE<br />THE INFLUENCE
1222794 1224025 OF THE GESTAPO.
1224094 1225661 I DON'T INTERFERE<br />WITH THEM.
1225730 1227429 THEY DON'T<br />INTERFERE WITH ME.
1227498 1229932 IN CASABLANCA, I'M<br />MASTER OF MY FATE.
1230001 1232034 MAJOR STRASSER'S<br />HERE, SIR.
1232103 1233769 YOU WERE SAYING.
1233838 1235274 EXCUSE ME.
1243914 1246414 CARL, SEE THAT MAJOR STRASSER<br />GETS A GOOD TABLE.
1246483 1247549 ONE CLOSE TO THE LADIES.
1247618 1249485 I'VE ALREADY<br />GIVEN HIM THE BEST,
1249554 1250619 KNOWING HE'S GERMAN
1250688 1252424 AND WOULD TAKE IT<br />ANYWAY.
1254358 1257293 TAKE HIM QUIETLY.<br />2 GUARDS AT EVERY DOOR.
1257362 1258530 YES, SIR.
1261966 1263299 EVERYTHING<br />IS READY, SIR.
1263368 1264536 GO AHEAD.
1270341 1271507 GOOD EVENING,<br />GENTLEMEN.
1271576 1272908 GOOD EVENING, CAPTAIN.
1272977 1274310 WON'T YOU JOIN US?
1274379 1275510 THANK YOU.
1275579 1278346 IT'S A PLEASURE<br />TO HAVE YOU HERE, MAJOR.
1278415 1280076 CHAMPAGNE<br />AND CAVIAR.
1280145 1281983 MAY I RECOMMEND<br />VEUVE CLIQUOT '26?
1282052 1283486 A GOOD FRENCH WINE.
1283555 1285488 VERY WELL, SIR.
1285557 1287489 VERY INTERESTING CLUB.
1287558 1288723 ESPECIALLY SO<br />TONIGHT, MAJOR.
1288792 1290458 IN A FEW MINUTES<br />YOU'LL SEE THE ARREST
1290527 1292493 OF THE MAN WHO MURDERED<br />YOUR COURIERS.
1292562 1294330 I EXPECTED NO LESS,<br />CAPTAIN.
1294399 1296699 MONSIEUR UGARTE.
1296768 1297933 OH.
1298002 1299334 YES?
1299403 1301937 WILL YOU PLEASE<br />COME WITH US?
1302006 1302805 CERTAINLY.
1302874 1304835 MAY I FIRST PLEASE<br />CASH MY CHIPS?
1304904 1308713 [SPEAKING<br />FRENCH]
1311548 1313349 PRETTY LUCKY, HUH?

1353324 1355657 I HOPE YOU'RE<br />MORE OF A HELP.
1355726 1358060 I STICK MY NECK OUT<br />FOR NOBODY.
1358129 1359660 I'M SORRY THERE WAS<br />A DISTURBANCE, FOLKS,
1359729 1361263 BUT IT'S ALL OVER NOW.<br />EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.
1361332 1363364 JUST SIT DOWN<br />AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
1363433 1364966 ENJOY YOURSELVES.<br />ALL RIGHT, SAM.
1365035 1368140 [MUSIC PLAYS]
1370775 1371907 RICK.
1371976 1374576 RICK, THIS IS MAJOR<br />HEINRICH STRASSER
1374645 1376111 OF THE THIRD REICH.
1376180 1378113 HOW DO YOU DO?
1378182 1380348 YOU ALREADY KNOW<br />HERR HEINZE.
1380417 1382754 PLEASE JOIN US,<br />MR. RICK.
1386190 1388189 WE ARE HONORED<br />TONIGHT, RICK.
1388258 1390025 MAJOR STRASSER<br />IS ONE REASON
1390094 1391259 THE THIRD REICH<br />ENJOYS
1391328 1393028 THE REPUTATION<br />IT HAS TODAY.
1393097 1394429 YOU REPEAT<br />THIRD REICH
1394498 1396431 AS THOUGH YOU EXPECTED<br />THERE TO BE OTHERS.
1396500 1398233 PERSONALLY, MAJOR<br />I'LL TAKE WHAT COMES.
1398302 1401603 MAY I ASK A FEW QUESTIONS--<br />UNOFFICIALLY, OF COURSE?
1401672 1403706 MAKE IT OFFICIAL<br />IF YOU LIKE.
1403775 1405441 WHAT IS YOUR<br />NATIONALITY?
1405510 1406975 I'M A DRUNKARD.
1407044 1410711 THAT MAKES RICK<br />A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.
1410780 1413581 I WAS BORN IN NEW YORK CITY<br />IF THAT'LL HELP YOU ANY.
1413650 1416451 YOU CAME HERE FROM PARIS<br />DURING THE OCCUPATION?
1416520 1418186 THERE'S NO SECRET<br />ABOUT THAT.
1418255 1420455 ARE YOU ONE<br />OF THOSE PEOPLE
1420524 1422157 WHO CANNOT<br />IMAGINE GERMANS
1422226 1423658 IN THEIR BELOVED PARIS?
1423727 1426122 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY<br /><i>MY</i> BELOVED PARIS.
1426191 1428124 CAN YOU IMAGINE US<br />IN LONDON?
1428193 1430899 WHEN YOU GET THERE,<br />ASK ME.
1430968 1432167 DIPLOMATIST.
1432236 1433701 HOW ABOUT NEW YORK?
1433770 1436604 THERE ARE CERTAIN SECTIONS<br />OF NEW YORK, MAJOR,
1436673 1439340 THAT I WOULDN'T ADVISE YOU<br />TO TRY TO INVADE.
1439409 1441476 WHO DO YOU THINK<br />WILL WIN THE WAR?
1441545 1443311 I HAVEN'T<br />THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.
1443380 1445347 RICK IS NEUTRAL<br />ABOUT EVERYTHING.
1445416 1446982 THAT INCLUDES<br />WOMEN, TOO.
1447051 1449484 YOU WERE NOT ALWAYS<br />SO NEUTRAL.
1449553 1452487 WE HAVE A COMPLETE<br />DOSSIER ON YOU.
1452556 1454489 "RICHARD BLAINE,<br />AMERICAN, 37.
1454558 1456491 CANNOT RETURN<br />TO HIS COUNTRY."
1456560 1458493 THE REASON<br />IS A LITTLE VAGUE.
1458562 1461096 WE ALSO KNOW WHAT<br />YOU DID IN PARIS
1461165 1462497 AND WHY YOU LEFT PARIS.
1462566 1465267 DON'T WORRY. WE AREN'T<br />GOING TO BROADCAST IT.
1465336 1467102 ARE MY EYES<br />REALLY BROWN?
1467171 1468937 FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY.
1469006 1470038 THE POINT IS,
1470107 1471907 AN ENEMY OF THE REICH<br />HAS COME TO CASABLANCA,
1471976 1475610 AND WE ARE CHECKING UP<br />ON ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP.
1475679 1478514 MY INTEREST IN WHETHER<br />VICTOR LASZLO STAYS OR GOES
1478583 1480815 IS PURELY A SPORTING ONE.
1480884 1483947 IN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE<br />NO SYMPATHY FOR THE FOX?
1484016 1485087 NOT PARTICULARLY.
1485156 1487455 I UNDERSTAND THE HOUND'S<br />POINT OF VIEW, TOO.
1487524 1489958 VICTOR LASZLO PUBLISHED<br />THE FOULEST LIES
1490027 1493162 IN THE PRAGUE NEWSPAPERS<br />UNTIL WE MARCHED IN.
1493231 1494496 EVEN AFTER THAT,
1494565 1497032 HE PRINTED SCANDAL<br />SHEETS IN A CELLAR.
1497101 1498300 ONE MUST ADMIT
1498369 1500163 HE HAS GREAT<br />COURAGE.
1500232 1501970 I ADMIT<br />HE'S VERY CLEVER.
1502039 1503138 3 TIMES HE SLIPPED<br />THROUGH OUR FINGERS.
1503207 1504940 IN PARIS HE CONTINUED<br />HIS ACTIVITIES.
1505009 1507176 WE INTEND NOT<br />TO LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.
1507245 1510312 EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.<br />YOUR BUSINESS IS POLITICS,
1510381 1512175 MINE IS RUNNING<br />A SALOON.

3323093 3324960 NO HURRY. I'LL HAVE IT<br />SENT OVER. HAVE A DRINK.
3325029 3327195 EVERY TIME YOU SEND<br />MY SHIPMENT OVER,
3327264 3328597 IT'S ALWAYS<br />A LITTLE SHORT.
3328666 3330800 CARRYING CHARGES,<br />MY BOY.
3330869 3332000 HERE, SIT DOWN.
3332069 3335804 THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT<br />TO TALK OVER WITH YOU.
3335873 3336872 THE BOURBON.
3336941 3339074 THE NEWS ABOUT UGARTE<br />UPSETS ME.
3339143 3340475 YOU'RE A FAT HYPOCRITE.
3340544 3342844 YOU DON'T FEEL ANY SORRIER<br />FOR UGARTE THAN I DO.
3342913 3343779 OF COURSE NOT.
3343848 3345746 WHAT UPSETS ME<br />IS THAT UGARTE'S DEAD,
3345815 3348183 AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THOSE<br />LETTERS OF TRANSIT ARE.
3348252 3349617 PRACTICALLY NO ONE.
3349686 3351419 IF I COULD<br />LAY MY HANDS ON THEM,
3351488 3352620 I COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.
3352689 3354389 SO COULD I, AND I'M<br />A POOR BUSINESSMAN.
3354458 3355557 I HAVE A PROPOSITION
3355626 3357392 FOR WHOEVER HAS<br />THOSE LETTERS.
3357461 3358793 I'LL HANDLE<br />THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION,
3358862 3361496 TAKE ALL THE RISK,<br />FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE.
3361565 3363565 AND THE CARRYING<br />CHARGES?
3363634 3366267 NATURALLY THERE WILL BE<br />A FEW INCIDENTAL EXPENSES.
3366336 3367770 THAT'S THE PROPOSITION<br />I HAVE
3367839 3369337 FOR WHOEVER<br />HAS THOSE LETTERS.
3369406 3370972 I'LL TELL HIM<br />WHEN HE COMES IN.
3371041 3373937 I THINK YOU KNOW<br />WHERE THOSE LETTERS ARE.
3374006 3375043 YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY.
3375112 3378017 RENAULT AND STRASSER<br />PROBABLY THINK SO, TOO.
3382353 3384086 THAT'S WHY<br />I CAME OVER HERE,
3384155 3386654 TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE<br />TO RANSACK MY PLACE.
3386723 3388990 DON'T BE A FOOL. TAKE ME<br />INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE.
3389059 3390192 YOU NEED A PARTNER.
3390261 3392164 EXCUSE ME.<br />I'LL BE GETTING BACK.
3394265 3395597 GOOD MORNING.
3395666 3398837 SIGNOR FERRARI'S<br />THE FAT GENT AT THE TABLE.
3403240 3406976 YOU WILL NOT FIND A TREASURE<br />LIKE THIS IN ALL MOROCCO.
3407045 3408377 ONLY 700 FRANCS.
3408446 3409778 YOU'RE BEING CHEATED.
3409847 3411280 IT DOESN'T MATTER.<br />THANK YOU.
3411349 3412614 THE LADY'S A FRIEND<br />OF RICK'S.
3412683 3414383 FOR FRIENDS OF RICK'S,<br />WE HAVE A SMALL DISCOUNT.
3414452 3415785 DID I SAY 700?
3415854 3417619 YOU CAN HAVE IT<br />FOR 200.
3417688 3419622 I'M SORRY I WAS<br />IN NO CONDITION
3419691 3421223 TO RECEIVE YOU<br />LAST NIGHT.
3421292 3422624 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
3422693 3424226 FOR SPECIAL FRIENDS<br />OF RICK'S,
3424295 3425627 A SPECIAL DISCOUNT--<br />100 FRANCS.
3425696 3428229 YOUR STORY HAD ME<br />A LITTLE CONFUSED.
3428298 3429898 MAYBE IT WAS THE BOURBON.
3429967 3431533 I HAVE SOME TABLECLOTHS,<br />SOME NAPKINS.
3431602 3432634 THANK YOU.<br />I'M NOT INTERESTED.
3432703 3434236 PLEASE, ONE MINUTE.
3434305 3435637 WHY DID YOU COME BACK,
3435706 3437305 TO TELL ME WHY<br />YOU RAN OUT ON ME
3437374 3438841 AT THE RAILWAY STATION.
3438910 3439875 YES.
3439944 3442311 YOU CAN TELL ME NOW.<br />I'M REASONABLY SOBER.
3442380 3443711 I DON'T THINK I WILL.
3443780 3446715 WHY NOT? I GOT STUCK<br />WITH THE RAILWAY TICKET.
3446784 3448717 I THINK I'M ENTITLED<br />TO KNOW.
3448786 3450719 LAST NIGHT, I SAW WHAT<br />HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.
3450788 3452454 THE RICK I KNEW<br />IN PARIS,
3452523 3454122 I COULD TELL HIM.<br />HE WOULD UNDERSTAND.
3454191 3457325 THE ONE WHO LOOKED AT ME<br />WITH SUCH HATRED...
3457394 3459327 I'LL BE LEAVING<br />CASABLANCA SOON.
3459396 3461596 WE'LL NEVER SEE<br />EACH OTHER AGAIN.
3461665 3464667 WE KNEW VERY LITTLE<br />ABOUT EACH OTHER
3464736 3467269 WHEN WE WERE IN LOVE<br />IN PARIS.
3467338 3469271 IF WE LEAVE IT THAT WAY,
3469340 3470672 MAYBE WE'LL REMEMBER<br />THOSE DAYS
3470741 3471674 AND NOT CASABLANCA.
3471743 3473676 NOT LAST NIGHT.
3473745 3475645 DID YOU RUN OUT ON ME
3475714 3477678 BECAUSE YOU<br />COULDN'T TAKE IT--
3477747 3480082 HIDING FROM THE POLICE,<br />RUNNING AWAY ALL THIS TIME?
3480151 3482212 YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT<br />IF YOU WANT TO.
3482281 3483485 I'M NOT<br />RUNNING AWAY ANYMORE.
3483554 3486088 I'M SETTLED NOW--<br />ABOVE A SALOON, IT'S TRUE,
3486157 3490862 BUT WALK UP A FLIGHT.<br />I'LL BE EXPECTING YOU.
3492162 3495698 ALL THE SAME, SOMEDAY<br />YOU'LL LIE TO LASZLO.
3495767 3497536 YOU'LL BE THERE.
3498970 3500303 NO, RICK.
3500372 3502303 NO. YOU SEE,
3502372 3504506 VICTOR LASZLO'S<br />MY HUSBAND.
3504575 3507947 AND WAS, EVEN WHEN<br />I KNEW YOU IN PARIS.
3512383 3514316 I WAS JUST TELLING<br />MONSIEUR LASZLO
3514385 3515484 THAT UNFORTUNATELY
3515553 3517319 I'M NOT ABLE<br />TO HELP HIM.
3517388 3519315 THE WORD<br />HAS GONE AROUND.
3519384 3521256 AS LEADER OF ALL<br />ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
3521325 3522391 IN CASABLANCA,
3522460 3524392 I'M AN INFLUENTIAL<br />AND RESPECTED MAN.
3524461 3526461 IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH<br />MY LIFE
3526530 3527996 TO DO ANYTHING<br />MONSIEUR LASZLO.
3528065 3530065 YOU, HOWEVER, ARE<br />A DIFFERENT MATTER.
3530134 3532834 SIGNOR FERRARI THINKS<br />IT MIGHT JUST BE POSSIBLE
3532903 3535838 TO GET AN EXIT VISA<br />FOR YOU.
3535907 3537673 YOU MEAN FOR ME<br />TO GO ON ALONE?
3537742 3538840 Ferrari:<br />AND ONLY ALONE.
3538909 3541810 I'LL STAY HERE<br />AND KEEP ON TRYING.
3541879 3543478 YOU MIGHT AS WELL<br />BE FRANK.
3543547 3544913 IT WOULD TAKE<br />A MIRACLE
3544982 3546014 TO GET YOU OUT<br />OF CASABLANCA,
3546083 3547615 AND THE GERMANS<br />OUTLAWED MIRACLES.
3547684 3550452 WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED<br />IN 2 VISAS.
3550521 3552520 PLEASE, ILSA,<br />DON'T BE HASTY.
3552589 3554857 YOU TWO WILL WANT<br />TO DISCUSS THIS.
3554926 3558097 EXCUSE ME.<br />I'LL BE AT THE BAR.
3560530 3562863 I WON'T LET YOU<br />STAY HERE.
3562932 3566329 YOU MUST GET TO AMERICA.<br />SOMEHOW I'LL JOIN YOU.
3566398 3567570 IF THE SITUATION<br />WERE DIFFERENT.
3567639 3568671 IF I HAD TO STAY
3568740 3570606 AND THERE WERE<br />ONLY VISA FOR ONE,
3570675 3572508 WOULD YOU TAKE IT?
3572577 3574938 YES, I WOULD.
3575007 3577473 YES, I SEE.
3577542 3579882 WHEN I HAD TROUBLE<br />GETTING OUT OF LILLES,
3579951 3581884 WHY DIDN'T YOU<br />LEAVE ME THERE?
3581953 3583318 WHEN I WAS SICK<br />IN MARSEILLES
3583387 3584453 AND HELD YOU UP<br />FOR 2 WEEKS,
3584522 3585887 AND YOU WERE IN<br />DANGER EVERY MINUTE,
3585956 3588323 WHY DIDN'T YOU<br />LEAVE ME THEN?
3588392 3592364 I MEANT TO, BUT SOMETHING<br />ALWAYS HELD ME UP.
3594031 3596131 I LOVE YOU<br />VERY MUCH, ILSA.
3596200 3599500 YOUR SECRET WILL BE<br />SAFE WITH ME.
3599569 3602705 FERRARI'S WAITING<br />FOR OUR ANSWER.
3602774 3606245 NOT MORE THAN<br />50 FRANCS, THOUGH.
3608545 3610279 WE HAVE DECIDED,<br />SIGNOR FERRARI.
3610348 3613882 FOR THE PRESENT, WE'RE ONLY<br />LOOKING FOR 2 EXIT VISAS.
3613951 3615483 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
3615552 3616886 GOOD LUCK, BUT BE CAREFUL.
3616955 3618486 YOU KNOW THAT<br />YOU'RE BEING SHADOWED?
3618555 3620288 OF COURSE.<br />IT BECOMES AN INSTINCT.
3620357 3623753 IN ONE RESPECT, YOU ARE<br />A VERY FORTUNATE MAN, MONSIEUR.
3623822 3626694 I MOVE TO MAKE ONE MORE<br />SUGGESTION. WHY, I DON'T KNOW,
3626763 3628424 BECAUSE IT CANNOT<br />POSSIBLY PROFIT ME.
3628493 3630465 HAVE YOU HEARD<br />ABOUT SIGNOR UGARTE
3630534 3631501 AND THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT?
3631570 3632867 YES. SOMETHING.
3632936 3636066 THEY WEREN'T ON UGARTE<br />WHEN THEY ARRESTED HIM.
3636135 3637139 WHERE ARE THEY?
3637208 3639341 NOT FOR SURE.<br />I'LL VENTURE TO GUESS
3639410 3641905 THAT UGARTE LEFT THEM<br />WITH MONSIEUR RICK.
3641974 3643078 RICK?
3643147 3646682 ONE NEVER KNOWS<br />WHAT RICK WILL DO OR WHY,
3646751 3649051 BUT IT IS WORTH A CHANCE.
3649120 3651519 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.<br />GOOD DAY.
3651588 3653522 GOODBYE. THANK YOU<br />FOR YOUR COFFEE.
3653591 3654957 I SHALL MISS THAT
3655026 3656324 WHEN WE LEAVE<br />CASABLANCA.
3656393 3660129 GRACIOUS OF YOU TO SHARE IT<br />WITH ME. GOOD DAY.
3660198 3661766 GOOD DAY.
3667605 3670672 [PIANO PLAYING]
3670741 3672275 HERE'S TO YOU, SIR.
3672344 3673542 GOOD LUCK.
3673611 3675138 I'D BETTER BE GOING.
3675207 3676545 MY CHECK, PLEASE.
3676614 3677946 I HAVE TO WARN YOU.
3678015 3679348 THIS IS A DANGEROUS PLACE<br />FULL OF VULTURES.
3679417 3681149 VULTURES EVERYWHERE.<br />THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
3681218 3682550 GOODBYE, SIR.
3682619 3685790 A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.<br />I'M SORRY.
3701037 3705210 MONSIEUR RICK, YOU ARE GETTING<br />TO BE YOUR BEST CUSTOMER.
3706576 3709978 DRINKING? NOW YOU'RE BEGINNING<br />TO LIVE LIKE A FRENCHMAN.
3710047 3712981 THAT'S SOME GOING-OVER<br />YOUR MEN GAVE MY PLACE.
3713050 3715985 WE BARELY GOT CLEANED UP<br />IN TIME TO OPEN.
3716054 3718853 I TOLD STRASSER<br />THE LETTERS WEREN'T HERE,
3718922 3721857 BUT I TOLD MY MEN TO BE<br />ESPECIALLY DESTRUCTIVE.
3721926 3723992 YOU KNOW HOW THAT<br />IMPRESSES GERMANS.
3724061 3726995 RICK, HAVE YOU GOT<br />THOSE LETTERS OF TRANSIT?
3727064 3729865 ARE YOU PRO-VICHY<br />OR FREE FRENCH?
3729934 3732868 SERVES ME RIGHT FOR ASKING<br />A DIRECT QUESTION.
3732937 3734602 THE SUBJECT IS CLOSED.
3734671 3737276 LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE<br />A LITTLE LATE.
3741446 3742611 HA HA HA!
3742680 3745480 SO YVONNE'S GONE OVER<br />TO THE ENEMY?
3745549 3747316 WHO KNOWS?<br />IN HER OWN WAY,
3747385 3749884 SHE MAY CONSTITUTE<br />AN ENTIRE SECOND FRONT.
3749953 3754223 IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FLATTER<br />MAJOR STRASSER A LITTLE.
3754292 3755624 SACHA!
3755693 3757026 FRENCH 75s.
3757095 3759629 WE'LL HAVE<br />A WHOLE ROW, SACHA,
3759698 3761630 STARTING HERE<br />AND ENDING HERE!
3761699 3763298 WE WILL BEGIN<br />WITH 2.
3763367 3764900 <i>VOUS N'ETES PAS</i><br /><i>FRANCAISE VOUS,</i>
3764969 3766902 <i>D'ALLER AVEC</i><br /><i>LES BOCHES COMME CA!</i>
3766971 3768504 <i>DE QUOI</i><br /><i>VOUS MELEZ-VOUS?</i>
3768573 3769804 NO, NO, NO.
3769873 3773041 WHAT DID YOU SAY?<br />WOULD YOU KINDLY REPEAT IT?
3773110 3775978 IT'S NONE<br />OF YOUR BUSINESS!
3776047 3777680 I'LL MAKE IT<br />MY BUSINESS.
3777749 3779882 <i>ARRETEZ,</i><br /><i>JE VOUS EN PRIE!</i>
3779951 3782652 <i>JE VOUS EN PRIE,</i><br /><i>ARRETEZ!</i>
3782721 3784653 I DON'T LIKE<br />DISTURBANCES HERE.
3784722 3787756 EITHER LAY OFF POLITICS<br />OR GET OUT!
3787825 3790291 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
3790360 3793696 YOU SEE, CAPTAIN,<br />THE SITUATION IS NOT AS MUCH
3793765 3795464 UNDER CONTROL<br />AS YOU BELIEVE.
3795533 3798466 WE'RE TRYING TO COOPERATE<br />WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT.
3798535 3801069 WE CANNOT REGULATE<br />OUR PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.
3801138 3803105 ARE YOU CERTAIN<br />WHICH SIDE YOU ARE ON?
3803174 3806207 I HAVE NO CONVICTION.<br />I BLOW WITH THE WIND.
3806276 3809078 THE PREVAILING WIND<br />HAPPENS TO BE FROM VICHY.
3809147 3811080 AND IF IT SHOULD<br />CHANGE?
3811149 3813916 SURELY THE REICH DOESN'T<br />ADMIT THAT POSSIBILITY.
3813985 3816217 WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT<br />MORE THAN CASABLANCA.
3816286 3818219 WE KNOW EVERY FRENCH<br />PROVINCE IN AFRICA
3818288 3820222 IS HONEYCOMBED<br />WITH TRAITORS
3820291 3823092 WAITING FOR THEIR CHANCE,<br />PERHAPS FOR A LEADER.
3823161 3824492 A LEADER? LIKE LASZLO?
3824561 3827395 IT'S TOO DANGEROUS<br />IF YOU LET HIM GO.
3827464 3830466 IT MAY BE TOO DANGEROUS<br />IF YOU LET HIM STAY.
3830535 3831567 I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.
3831636 3834940 [SPEAKING GERMAN]
3836373 3837706 THANK YOU, CARL.
3837775 3839308 [SPEAKING GERMAN]
3839377 3840703 THANK YOU, CARL.
3840772 3843511 CARL, SIT DOWN.<br />HAVE A BRANDY WITH US.
3843580 3846709 TO CELEBRATE OUR LEAVING<br />FOR AMERICA TOMORROW.
3846778 3849117 THANK YOU. I THOUGHT<br />YOU WOULD ASK ME,
3849186 3852722 SO I BROUGHT THE GOOD BRANDY...<br />AND...A THIRD GLASS.
3852791 3855123 AT LAST,<br />THE DAY IS CAME!
3855192 3858126 WE ARE SPEAKING<br />NOTHING BUT ENGLISH NOW.
3858195 3861096 SO WE SHOULD FEEL<br />AT HOME IN AMERICA.
3861165 3863299 VERY NICE IDEA.<br />HA HA.
3863368 3864733 TO AMERICA.
3864802 3866502 TO AMERICA.
3866571 3868240 TO AMERICA.
3871208 3874980 <i>LIEBCHEN,</i> SWEETNESS,<br />WHAT WATCH?
3876413 3877747 10:00 WATCH.
3877816 3879284 SUCH MUCH?
3880217 3883118 YOU WILL GET ALONG<br />BEAUTIFULLY IN AMERICA.
3883187 3885754 HOW'S LADY LUCK<br />TREATING YOU?
3885823 3887055 OH, TOO BAD.
3887124 3889394 YOU'LL FIND HIM<br />OVER THERE.
3894832 3896999 MONSIEUR RICK?<br />YES.
3897068 3899200 COULD I SPEAK<br />TO YOU, PLEASE?
3899269 3901236 HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?<br />YOU'RE UNDERAGE.
3901305 3902772 I CAME WITH<br />CAPTAIN RENAULT.
3902841 3904773 OH, I SHOULD HAVE<br />KNOWN.
3904842 3907175 MY HUSBAND<br />IS WITH ME, TOO.
3907244 3908778 HE IS? CAPTAIN RENAULT'S<br />GETTING BROAD-MINDED.
3908847 3911179 WILL YOU HAVE A DRINK?<br />OF COURSE NOT.
3911248 3913181 DO YOU MIND IF I DO?
3913250 3915785 WHAT KIND OF A MAN<br />IS CAPTAIN RENAULT?
3915854 3918186 LIKE ANY OTHER,<br />ONLY MORE SO.
3918255 3921757 NO, I MEAN, IS HE TRUSTWORTHY?<br />IS HIS WORD--
3921826 3924793 WAIT. WHO TOLD YOU<br />TO ASK ME THAT?
3924862 3926796 HE DID.<br />CAPTAIN RENAULT DID.
3926865 3928130 I THOUGHT SO.<br />WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
3928199 3929497 AT THE ROULETTE TABLE,
3929566 3933202 TRYING TO WIN ENOUGH<br />FOR OUR EXIT VISAS.
3933271 3935203 OF COURSE HE'S LOSING.
3935272 3937807 HOW LONG HAVE YOU<br />BEEN MARRIED?
3937876 3940208 8 WEEKS.<br />WE COME FROM BULGARIA.
3940277 3942210 THINGS ARE VERY<br />BAD THERE.
3942279 3945213 THE DEVIL HAS THE PEOPLE<br />BY THE THROAT.
3945282 3948684 JAN AND I, WE DO NOT<br />WANT OUR CHILDREN
3948753 3951353 TO GROW UP<br />IN SUCH A COUNTRY.
3951422 3953956 SO YOU DECIDED<br />TO GO TO AMERICA.
3954025 3955623 YES, BUT WE HAVEN'T<br />MUCH MONEY.
3955692 3958226 TRAVELING IS SO EXPENSIVE<br />AND DIFFICULT.
3958295 3961830 IT WAS MUCH MORE<br />THAN WE THOUGHT TO GET HERE.
3961899 3963832 THEN CAPTAIN RENAULT<br />SEES US.
3963901 3965834 HE IS SO KIND.<br />HE WANTS TO HELP US.
3965903 3967302 YES. I'LL BET.
3967371 3970706 HE SAYS HE CAN GIVE US<br />AN EXIT VISA,
3970775 3972541 BUT WE HAVE NO MONEY.
3972610 3974710 HE KNOWS THAT, AND<br />HE'S STILL WILLING
3974779 3975978 TO GIVE YOU A VISA?
3976047 3976978 YES.
3977047 3978147 YOU WANT TO KNOW...
3978216 3980048 WILL HE KEEP HIS WORD?

3996200 4000135 BUT SHE DID A BAD THING<br />TO MAKE CERTAIN OF IT,

4875113 4876444 IF YOU DON'T HELP US,
4876513 4878380 VICTOR LASZLO<br />WILL DIE IN CASABLANCA.
4878449 4881650 WHAT OF IT? I'M GOING<br />TO DIE IN CASABLANCA.
4881719 4883883 IT'S A GOOD SPOT FOR IT.
4889127 4891163 NOW, IF YOU--
4892262 4895797 ALL RIGHT, I TRIED<br />TO REASON WITH YOU.
4895866 4897967 I TRIED EVERYTHING.
4898036 4899569 NOW I WANT<br />THOSE LETTERS.
4899638 4900936 GET THEM FOR ME.
4901005 4903175 I DON'T HAVE TO.<br />I GOT THEM RIGHT HERE.
4904742 4907410 PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.
4907479 4909277 NO.
4909346 4912480 FOR THE LAST TIME,<br />PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.
4912549 4915685 IF LASZLO AND THE CAUSE<br />MEAN SO MUCH,
4915754 4917886 YOU WON'T STOP AT ANYTHING.
4917955 4921460 ALL RIGHT. I'LL<br />MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU.
4923027 4924960 GO AHEAD AND SHOOT.
4925029 4927599 YOU'LL BE<br />DOING ME A FAVOR.
4931903 4933235 RICHARD.
4933304 4936238 I TRIED TO STAY AWAY.
4936307 4939842 I THOUGHT I WOULD<br />NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
4939911 4943082 THAT YOU WERE<br />OUT OF MY LIFE.
4963333 4965966 THE DAY<br />YOU LEFT PARIS...
4967205 4970138 IF YOU KNEW WHAT<br />I WENT THROUGH.
4970207 4973141 IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH<br />I LOVED YOU.
4973210 4977249 HOW MUCH<br />I STILL LOVE YOU.
4990962 4992394 AND THEN?
4992463 4995430 IT WASN'T LONG<br />AFTER WE WERE MARRIED
4995499 4998033 THAT VICTOR WENT BACK<br />TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA.
4998102 5000035 THEY NEEDED HIM<br />IN PRAGUE,
5000104 5002437 BUT THERE THE GESTAPO<br />WERE WAITING FOR HIM.
5002506 5003972 JUST A 2-LINE ITEM<br />IN THE PAPER,
5004041 5005040 "VICTOR LASZLO<br />APPREHENDED.
5005109 5007175 SENT TO<br />CONCENTRATION CAMP."
5007244 5008778 I WAS FRANTIC.
5008847 5011780 FOR MONTHS<br />I TRIED TO GET WORD.
5011849 5013048 THEN IT CAME.
5013117 5016051 HE WAS DEAD--<br />SHOT TRYING TO ESCAPE.
5016120 5017986 I WAS LONELY.<br />I HAD NOTHING--
5018055 5019655 NOT EVEN HOPE.
5019724 5021223 THEN I MET YOU.
5021292 5023191 WHY WEREN'T YOU<br />HONEST WITH ME?
5023260 5026194 WHY DID YOU KEEP<br />YOUR MARRIAGE A SECRET?
5026263 5027429 IT WASN'T MY SECRET.
5027498 5029197 VICTOR WANTED IT<br />THAT WAY.
5029266 5030765 OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS<br />DIDN'T KNOW.
5030834 5034469 HE WANTED TO PROTECT ME.<br />I KNEW ABOUT HIS WORK.
5034538 5036805 IF THE GESTAPO KNEW<br />I WAS HIS WIFE,
5036874 5038107 IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS<br />FOR ME
5038176 5039474 AND FOR THOSE<br />WORKING WITH US.
5039543 5042678 WHEN DID YOU FIRST<br />FIND OUT HE WAS ALIVE?
5042747 5044479 JUST BEFORE YOU AND I
5044548 5046481 WERE TO<br />LEAVE PARIS TOGETHER.
5046550 5049084 A FRIEND TOLD ME<br />VICTOR WAS ALIVE.
5049153 5050953 THEY WERE HIDING HIM<br />IN A FREIGHT CAR
5051022 5052955 ON THE OUTSKIRTS<br />OF PARIS.
5053024 5054951 HE WAS SICK.<br />HE NEEDED ME.
5055020 5058360 I WANTED TO TELL YOU,<br />BUT I DIDN'T DARE.
5058429 5061363 I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T<br />HAVE LEFT PARIS
5061432 5064366 AND THE GESTAPO<br />WOULD HAVE CAUGHT YOU.
5064435 5067606 SO I...WELL,<br />YOU KNOW THE REST.
5069840 5072975 WELL, IT'S STILL<br />A STORY WITHOUT AN ENDING.
5073044 5074944 WHAT ABOUT NOW?
5075013 5076712 NOW?
5076781 5078113 I DON'T KNOW.
5078182 5081717 I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER<br />HAVE THE STRENGTH
5081786 5083118 TO LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
5083187 5085353 AND LASZLO?
5085422 5087122 YOU'LL HELP HIM,<br />WON'T YOU?
5087191 5089024 YOU'LL SEE<br />THAT HE GETS OUT.
5089093 5090392 THEN HE'LL HAVE<br />HIS WORK--
5090461 5092728 ALL THAT HE'S<br />BEEN LIVING FOR.
5092797 5094129 ALL EXCEPT ONE.
5094198 5096735 HE WON'T HAVE YOU.
5098870 5101403 I CAN'T FIGHT IT<br />ANYMORE.
5101472 5104005 I RAN AWAY<br />FROM YOU ONCE.
5104074 5106245 I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.
5107611 5110545 I DON'T KNOW<br />WHAT'S RIGHT ANY LONGER.
5110614 5113749 YOU HAVE TO THINK<br />FOR BOTH OF US,
5113818 5115787 FOR ALL OF US.
5119223 5120756 ALL RIGHT.
5120825 5122394 I WILL.
5125495 5127799 HERE'S LOOKING<br />AT YOU, KID.
5129367 5132537 I WISH I DIDN'T<br />LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
5144983 5146715 I THINK<br />WE LOST THEM.
5146784 5149919 YES. I'M AFRAID THEY CAUGHT<br />SOME OF THE OTHERS.
5149988 5151556 COME INSIDE.<br />COME.
5154024 5155925 COME, MR. LASZLO.
5155994 5159194 I WILL HELP YOU...<br />IMMEDIATELY.
5159263 5160499 THANK YOU.
5162801 5165304 [VOICES]
5179150 5180482 CARL, WHAT HAPPENED?
5180551 5183485 THE POLICE BREAK UP<br />OUR MEETING, HERR RICK.
5183554 5185821 WE ESCAPED<br />IN THE LAST MOMENT.
5185890 5187222 COME UP HERE.
5187291 5189625 TURN OUT THE LIGHT<br />IN THE REAR ENTRANCE.
5189694 5191226 IT MIGHT<br />ATTRACT THE POLICE.
5191295 5192795 SACHA ALWAYS<br />PUTS IT OUT.
5192864 5193929 TONIGHT HE FORGOT.
5193998 5196368 I WILL DO IT.
5203202 5206175 I WANT YOU<br />TO TAKE MISS LUND HOME.
5206244 5207412 YES, SIR.
5217521 5219454 IT'S NOTHING.<br />JUST A LITTLE CUT.
5219523 5221591 WE HAD TO GET<br />THROUGH A WINDOW.
5221660 5223793 THIS MIGHT<br />COME IN HANDY.
5223862 5225193 THANK YOU.
5225262 5227195 HAD A CLOSE ONE, EH?
5227264 5229331 YES, RATHER.
5229400 5232735 DON'T YOU SOMETIMES WONDER<br />IF IT'S WORTH ALL THIS?
5232804 5235604 I MEAN, WHAT<br />YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR.
5235673 5238206 YOU MIGHT AS WELL QUESTION<br />WHY WE BREATHE.
5238275 5240475 IF WE STOP BREATHING,<br />WE'LL DIE.
5240544 5242878 IF WE STOP FIGHTING OUR<br />ENEMIES, THE WORLD WILL DIE.
5242947 5245080 WHAT OF IT? IT'LL BE<br />OUT OF ITS MISERY.
5245149 5246481 YOU KNOW HOW YOU SOUND?
5246550 5249484 LIKE A MAN TRYING TO CONVINCE<br />HIMSELF OF SOMETHING
5249553 5252454 HE DOESN'T BELIEVE<br />IN HIS HEART.
5252523 5256091 EACH OF US HAS A DESTINY--<br />FOR GOOD OR EVIL.
5256160 5257493 I GET THE POINT.
5257562 5258893 I WONDER IF YOU DO.
5258962 5262097 DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING<br />TO ESCAPE FROM YOURSELF?
5262166 5263531 YOU'LL NEVER SUCCEED.
5263600 5266601 YOU SEEM TO KNOW<br />ALL ABOUT MY DESTINY.
5266670 5270605 I KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE<br />ABOUT YOU THAN YOU SUSPECT.
5270674 5273608 I KNOW THAT YOU'RE<br />IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN.
5273677 5275010 IT'S PERHAPS<br />A STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE
5275079 5277913 THAT WE BOTH SHOULD BE<br />IN LOVE WITH THE SAME WOMAN.
5277982 5280515 THE FIRST EVENING<br />I CAME TO THIS CAFE,
5280584 5283918 I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING<br />BETWEEN YOU AND ILSA.
5283987 5287256 SINCE NO ONE'S TO BLAME,<br />I DEMAND NO EXPLANATION.
5287325 5289258 I ASK ONLY ONE THING.
5289327 5291659 YOU WON'T GIVE ME<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.
5291728 5294662 ALL RIGHT, BUT I<br />WANT MY WIFE TO BE SAFE.
5294731 5299267 I ASK YOU TO USE THE LETTERS<br />TO TAKE HER AWAY.
5299336 5301264 YOU LOVE HER<br />THAT MUCH?
5301333 5305273 YOU THINK OF ME<br />ONLY AS A LEADER OF A CAUSE.
5305342 5307275 I'M ALSO A HUMAN BEING.
5307344 5309881 YES, I LOVE HER THAT MUCH.
5315948 5317220 MONSIEUR LASZLO?
5317289 5318553 YES?
5318622 5321290 COME WITH US. WE HAVE<br />A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.
5321359 5322691 ON WHAT CHARGE?
5322760 5324926 CAPTAIN RENAULT WILL<br />DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU LATER.
5324995 5328033 IT SEEMS THAT DESTINY<br />HAS TAKEN A HAND.
5338775 5341309 YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T<br />ANY ACTUAL PROOF.
5341378 5343711 THIS ISN'T GERMANY<br />OR OCCUPIED FRANCE.
5343780 5346715 YOU CAN ONLY FINE HIM<br />AND GIVE HIM 30 DAYS.
5346784 5348316 YOU MIGHT AS WELL<br />LET HIM GO NOW.
5348385 5349685 I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO BE<br />TOO INTERESTED
5349754 5351086 IN WHAT HAPPENS<br />TO LASZLO.
5351155 5352321 IF YOU HELPED HIM<br />ESCAPE--
5352390 5355724 WHY WOULD I STICK<br />MY NECK OUT FOR LASZLO?
5355793 5357725 1--YOU BET 10,000 FRANCS<br />HE'D ESCAPE.
5357794 5359923 2--YOU'VE GOT<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.
5359992 5361329 DON'T BOTHER TO DENY IT.
5361398 5362730 AND YOU MIGHT DO IT
5362799 5364933 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE<br />STRASSER'S LOOKS.
5365002 5366201 AS A MATTER OF FACT,
5366270 5367336 I DON'T LIKE THEM,<br />EITHER.
5367405 5368503 THEY'RE ALL<br />EXCELLENT REASONS.
5368572 5369705 DON'T COUNT TOO MUCH<br />ON MY FRIENDSHIP.
5369774 5372340 IN THIS MATTER,<br />I'M POWERLESS.
5372409 5374075 BESIDES, I MIGHT LOSE<br />THE 10,000 FRANCS.
5374144 5377212 YOU'RE NOT VERY SUBTLE,<br />BUT YOU ARE EFFECTIVE.
5377281 5379014 I GET THE POINT.
5379083 5383018 YES, I HAVE THE LETTERS.<br />I INTEND USING THEM MYSELF.
5383087 5386021 I'M LEAVING CASABLANCA<br />ON THE LAST PLANE TONIGHT.
5386090 5389224 I'M TAKING A FRIEND--<br />ONE YOU'LL APPRECIATE.
5389293 5390225 WHAT FRIEND?
5390294 5391560 ILSA LUND.
5391629 5394362 THAT SHOULD PUT YOUR MIND<br />TO REST ABOUT LASZLO--
5394431 5397967 THE LAST MAN I WANT<br />TO SEE IN AMERICA.
5398036 5400435 YOU DIDN'T COME HERE<br />TO TELL ME THIS.
5400504 5402437 YOU HAVE THE LETTERS<br />OF TRANSIT.
5402506 5404439 YOU CAN LEAVE<br />ANYTIME YOU PLEASE.
5404508 5406508 WHY ARE YOU STILL<br />INTERESTED
5406577 5408104 IN WHAT HAPPENS<br />TO LASZLO?
5408173 5409912 I'M NOT.<br />BUT I AM INTERESTED
5409981 5412514 IN WHAT HAPPENS<br />TO ILSA AND ME.
5412583 5414510 WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT<br />TO GO, THAT'S TRUE,
5414579 5417786 BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELD<br />IN SPITE OF THEIR RIGHTS.
5417855 5419388 WHY SHOULD<br />WE HOLD YOU?
5419457 5420822 ILSA'S LASZLO'S WIFE.
5420891 5424993 SHE PROBABLY KNOWS THINGS<br />STRASSER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
5425062 5426195 I'LL MAKE A DEAL.
5426264 5428796 INSTEAD OF THIS PETTY CHARGE,<br />GET SOMETHING BIG
5428865 5431799 THAT WOULD CHUCK HIM IN<br />A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR YEARS.
5431868 5434403 IT'D BE QUITE A FEATHER<br />IN YOUR CAP, WOULDN'T IT?
5434472 5435804 IT CERTAINLY WOULD.
5435873 5438006 GERMANY--VICHY<br />WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL.
5438075 5439207 THEN RELEASE HIM.
5439276 5442411 BE AT MY PLACE A HALF HOUR<br />BEFORE THE PLANE LEAVES.
5442480 5443745 I'LL HAVE LASZLO COME THERE
5443814 5445947 TO PICK UP<br />THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT--
5446016 5447582 THAT'LL GIVE YOU THE CRIMINAL<br />GROUNDS FOR ARREST.
5447651 5450385 YOU GET HIM,<br />AND WE GET AWAY.
5450454 5454056 TO THE GERMANS, THAT LAST ONE<br />WILL BE JUST A MINOR ANNOYANCE.
5454125 5456325 THERE'S STILL SOMETHING<br />I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.
5456394 5458660 MISS LUND--SHE'S<br />VERY BEAUTIFUL, YES,
5458729 5461664 BUT YOU WERE NEVER<br />INTERESTED IN ANY WOMAN.
5461733 5463665 SHE ISN'T<br />JUST ANY WOMAN.
5463734 5467669 I SEE. HOW DO I KNOW<br />YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD?
5467738 5469404 I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS<br />RIGHT NOW WITH LASZLO
5469473 5470673 IN THE VISITORS' PEN.
5470742 5472268 RICKY,<br />I'LL MISS YOU.
5472337 5473408 YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE<br />IN CASABLANCA
5473477 5475277 WHO HAS EVEN LESS<br />SCRUPLES THAN I.
5475346 5476278 THANKS.
5476347 5477545 GO AHEAD, RICKY.
5477614 5480548 CALL OFF YOUR WATCHDOGS<br />WHEN YOU LET HIM GO.
5480617 5482550 I DON'T WANT THEM AROUND<br />THIS AFTERNOON.
5482619 5485257 I'M TAKING NO CHANCES,<br />NOT EVEN WITH YOU.
5491896 5493428 SHALL WE<br />DRAW UP PAPERS,
5493497 5495430 OR IS A HANDSHAKE<br />GOOD ENOUGH?
5495499 5496966 CERTAINLY<br />NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
5497035 5499167 BUT SINCE I'M IN A<br />HURRY, IT'LL HAVE TO DO.
5499236 5501570 AH, TO LEAVE CASABLANCA<br />AND GO TO AMERICA--
5501639 5502971 YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.
5503040 5505707 BY THE WAY,<br />MY AGREEMENT WITH SAM
5505776 5508110 IS THAT HE GETS<br />25% OF THE PROFITS.
5508179 5511213 I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S 10%,<br />BUT HE'S WORTH 25.
5511282 5514349 ABDUL, CARL, AND SACHA<br />STAY, OR I DON'T SELL.
5514418 5517453 OF COURSE. RICK'S WOULDN'T<br />BE RICK'S WITHOUT THEM.
5517522 5518854 WELL, SO LONG.
5518923 5520455 DON'T FORGET,<br />YOU OWE RICK'S
5520524 5522457 100 CARTONS OF<br />AMERICAN CIGARETTES.
5522526 5525697 I SHALL REMEMBER<br />TO PAY IT TO MYSELF.
5544148 5546251 [BANGING ON DOOR]
5559029 5560228 YOU'RE LATE.
5560297 5561163 I WAS INFORMED
5561232 5562898 JUST AS LASZLO WAS<br />LEAVING THE HOTEL,
5562967 5564199 SO I KNEW<br />I'D BE ON TIME.
5564268 5565901 I ASKED YOU TO TIE UP<br />YOUR WATCHDOGS.
5565970 5567136 HE WON'T BE<br />FOLLOWED HERE.
5567205 5568637 THIS PLACE WON'T BE<br />THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.
5568706 5570038 I KNOW, BUT I'VE ALREADY<br />SPOKEN TO FERRARI.
5570107 5571640 YOU'LL STILL<br />WIN AT ROULETTE.
5571709 5573242 IS EVERYTHING READY?
5573311 5574642 I HAVE<br />THE LETTERS.
5574711 5577245 WHEN WE SEARCHED THE PLACE,<br />WHERE WERE THEY?
5577314 5578213 SAM'S PIANO.
5578282 5580650 SERVES ME RIGHT<br />FOR NOT BEING MUSICAL.
5580719 5581650 [BRAKES SQUEAL]
5581719 5583052 HERE THEY ARE.
5583121 5585290 YOU'D BETTER<br />WAIT IN MY OFFICE.
5593230 5595230 HERE.
5595299 5597266 RICHARD, VICTOR THINKS<br />I'M LEAVING WITH HIM.
5597335 5598667 HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HIM?
5598736 5600068 NO, NOT YET.
5600137 5602171 IT'S ALL RIGHT?<br />YOU ARRANGED EVERYTHING?
5602240 5603738 YES. WE'LL TELL HIM<br />AT THE AIRPORT.
5603807 5605475 THE LESS TIME TO THINK,<br />THE EASIER FOR ALL OF US.
5605544 5606778 PLEASE TRUST ME.
5609046 5611050 YES, I WILL.
5613083 5616685 MONSIEUR BLAINE, I DON'T<br />KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.
5616754 5619658 SAVE IT. WE'VE LOTS<br />OF THINGS TO DO.
5620758 5622091 I BROUGHT<br />THE MONEY.
5622160 5624560 KEEP IT. YOU'LL<br />NEED IT IN AMERICA.
5624629 5626361 BUT WE<br />MADE A DEAL.
5626430 5629198 NEVER MIND. WILL YOU<br />HAVE TROUBLE IN LISBON?
5629267 5630365 NO. IT'S ALL ARRANGED.
5630434 5633568 GOOD. THE LETTERS ARE<br />ALL MADE OUT IN BLANK.
5633637 5635571 JUST FILL IN<br />THE SIGNATURES.
5635640 5637467 VICTOR LASZLO?
5637536 5639811 VICTOR LASZLO,<br />YOU'RE UNDER ARREST...
5643147 5644446 ON THE CHARGE<br />OF ACCESSORY
5644515 5645580 TO THE MURDER<br />OF THE COURIERS
5645649 5647249 FROM WHOM THESE LETTERS<br />WERE STOLEN.
5647318 5649885 YOU'RE SURPRISED<br />ABOUT MY FRIEND RICKY?
5649954 5651887 THE EXPLANATION<br />IS QUITE SIMPLE.
5651956 5654456 LOVE, IT SEEMS, HAS<br />TRIUMPHED OVER VIRTUE.
5654525 5655891 NOT SO FAST, LOUIS.
5655960 5657493 NOBODY IS GOING<br />TO BE ARRESTED,
5657562 5659628 NOT FOR A WHILE YET.

5838475 5841176 WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO,<br />YOU CAN'T BE PART OF.
5841245 5843913 I'M NO GOOD<br />AT BEING NOBLE,
5843982 5845914 BUT IT DOESN'T<br />TAKE MUCH TO SEE
5845983 5847715 THAT THE PROBLEMS<br />OF THREE LITTLE PEOPLE

5894893 5897365 SHE TRIED EVERYTHING,<br />AND NOTHING WORKED.
5897434 5900101 SHE DID HER BEST<br />TO CONVINCE ME
5900170 5902504 THAT SHE WAS STILL<br />IN LOVE WITH ME.
5902573 5904505 THAT WAS OVER LONG AGO.<br />FOR YOUR SAKE,
