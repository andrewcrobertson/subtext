74909 78913 <i>...many eyes in imprisoned Europe<br />turned hopefully, or desperately...</i>
79246 81916 <i>...toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>
82166 84794 <i>Lisbon became<br />the great embarkation point.</i>
85002 88172 <i>But not everybody could get<br />to Lisbon directly.</i>
88589 92259 <i>And so a torturous, roundabout<br />refugee trail sprang up.</i>
93302 94929 <i>Paris to Marseilles...</i>
100935 103604 <i>...across the Mediterranean to Oran.</i>
110945 115407 <i>Then, by train or auto or foot,<br />across the rim of Africa...</i>
115616 118119 <i>...to Casablanca in French Morocco.</i>
118369 122873 <i>Here, the fortunate ones,<br />through money or influence or luck...</i>
123207 126544 <i>...might obtain exit visas<br />and scurry to Lisbon.</i>
126919 129171 <i>And from Lisbon to the New World.</i>
129380 132550 <i>But the others wait in Casablanca.</i>
133217 136720 <i>And wait and wait...</i>

1092509 1094636 - It shall not happen again.<br />- That's all right.
1094844 1097680 Louis, you got something on your mind.<br />Why don't you spill it.
1097847 1099349 How observant you are.
1099682 1102352 As a matter of fact,<br />I wanted to give you a word of advice.
1102519 1103561 Yeah?
1103853 1106147 - Have a brandy?<br />- Thank you.
1107273 1109234 There are many exit visas<br />sold in this café...
1109400 1111277 ...but we know<br />that you've never sold one.
1111778 1113947 That is the reason<br />we permit you to remain open.
1114114 1116407 I thought it was because<br />I let you win at roulette.
1116574 1117826 That is another reason.
1118034 1120787 There is a man arrived in Casablanca<br />on his way to America.
1120995 1123873 He will offer a fortune to anyone<br />who'll furnish an exit visa.
1124040 1126543 - What's his name?<br />- Victor Laszlo.
1126918 1128336 Victor Laszlo?
1128503 1131089 Rick, that is the first time<br />I've seen you so impressed.
1131256 1133258 He's succeeded in impressing<br />half the world.
1133424 1136886 It's my duty to see that<br />he doesn't impress the other half.
1137053 1140056 Laszlo must never reach America.<br />He stays in Casablanca.
1140348 1142308 It'll be interesting<br />to see how he manages.
1142517 1144644 - Manages what?<br />- His escape.
1144853 1146729 - But I just told you--<br />- Stop it.
1146896 1148731 He escaped from<br />a concentration camp.
1148898 1150859 The Nazis have chased him<br />all over Europe.
1151025 1154863 - This is the end of the chase.<br />- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
1155071 1156406 Is that a serious offer?
1156739 1158908 I just paid out 20,<br />and I'd like to get it back.
1159242 1161911 Make it 10.<br />I'm only a poor corrupt official.
1162745 1163913 - Okay.<br />- Done.
1164122 1168126 No matter how clever he is, he still<br />needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.
1168585 1170628 - Why two?<br />- He is traveling with a lady.
1170837 1173548 - He'll take one.<br />- I think not. I've seen the lady.
1173840 1176467 And if he did not leave her<br />in Marseilles or Oran...
1177010 1179095 ...he certainly won't leave her<br />in Casablanca.
1179304 1181431 Maybe he's not quite<br />as romantic as you are.
1181639 1184893 It doesn't matter.<br />There is no exit visa for him.
1185518 1189105 Whatever gave you the impression<br />that I might help Laszlo escape?
1189480 1192650 Because, my dear Ricky,<br />I suspect that under that cynical shell...
1192817 1194569 ...you are at heart a sentimentalist.
1195195 1198114 Laugh if you will, but I happen<br />to be familiar with your record.
1198364 1200450 Let me point out just two items:
1200783 1204787 In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.
1204954 1208875 In 1936, you fought in Spain<br />on the Loyalist side.
1209083 1211377 And got well paid for it<br />on both occasions.
1211586 1213880 The winning side would<br />have paid you much better.
1214255 1216174 - Maybe.<br />- Uh-huh.
1216341 1218551 It seems you're determined<br />to keep Laszlo here.
1218760 1220511 I have my orders.
1221304 1223139 I see. Gestapo spank.
1223348 1226142 My dear Ricky, you overestimate<br />the influence of the Gestapo.
1226351 1229687 I don't interfere with them,<br />and they don't interfere with me.
1229896 1231981 In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.
1232148 1234317 - I am--<br />- Major Strasser is here, sir.
1234484 1236694 - You were saying?<br />- Excuse me.
1246496 1249707 Carl, see that Major Strasser<br />gets a good table, close to the ladies.
1249916 1251751 I have already given him the best...
1251918 1254504 ...knowing he is German<br />and would take it anyway.
1256673 1258716 Take him quietly.<br />Two guards at every door.
1258883 1260760 Yes, sir.
1264264 1266808 - Everything is ready, sir.<br />- Go ahead.
1272522 1274857 - Good evening, gentlemen.<br />- Good evening, captain.
1275024 1277026 - Won't you join us?<br />- Thank you.
1278111 1281864 - It's a pleasure to have you here, major.<br />- Champagne and a tin of caviar.
1282031 1284701 May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,<br />a good French wine.
1284867 1287578 - Thank you.<br />- Very well, sir.
1287870 1291082 - A very interesting club.<br />- Especially so tonight, major.
1291291 1294877 In a few minutes you'll see the arrest<br />of the man who murdered your couriers.
1295044 1296587 I expected no less, captain.
1296838 1298381 Monsieur Ugarte.
1299007 1301259 Oh. Yes?
1301426 1303803 - Will you please come with us?<br />- Certainly.
1305179 1307056 May I first please cash my chips?
1307682 1309934 [DEALER SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
1314147 1316816 Very lucky, huh?<br />Two thousand, please.
1324032 1325992 Thank you.
1335918 1338212 [SCREAMING]
1338713 1340631 Rick! Rick, help me!
1340882 1344927 - Don't be a fool. You can't get away.<br />- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!
1352602 1353936 Excellent, captain.
1354103 1356773 When they come for me,<br />I hope you'll be more of a help.
1356939 1359025 I stick my neck out for nobody.
1359275 1363071 I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,<br />but it's all over now.
1363279 1366240 Just sit down and have a good time.<br />Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.
1366407 1367867 Okay, boss.
1368034 1370703 [BAND PLAYING]
1372914 1374332 RENAULT:<br />Rick.
1374624 1378086 Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser<br />of the Third Reich.
1378252 1380129 - How do you do, Mr. Rick?<br />- How do you do?
1380296 1382465 You already know Herr Heinze<br />of the Third Reich.
1382632 1385134 Please join us, Mr. Rick.
1388721 1390306 We are very honored tonight.
1390473 1394644 Major Strasser is one of the reasons the<br />Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.
1394811 1397772 You repeat Third Reich as though<br />you expected there to be others.
1397980 1400566 Well, personally, major,<br />I will take what comes.
1401692 1403778 Do you mind<br />if I ask you a few questions?
1403986 1406531 - Unofficially, of course.<br />- Make it official if you like.
1406697 1409325 - What is your nationality?<br />- I'm a drunkard.
1410910 1412954 And that makes Rick a citizen<br />of the world.
1413246 1415790 I was born in New York City,<br />if that'll help you any.
1416332 1419502 I understand you came here from Paris<br />at the time of the occupation.
1419669 1421421 There seems to be no secret<br />about that.
1421629 1423047 Are you one of those people...
1423214 1426008 ...who cannot imagine the Germans<br />in their beloved Paris?
1426175 1428177 It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
1428386 1430263 Can you imagine us in London?
1431389 1432890 When you get there, ask me.
1433349 1434517 Diplomatist.
1434684 1435852 How about New York?
1436018 1438104 Well, there are<br />sections of New York, major...
1438312 1440273 ...that I wouldn't advise<br />you to try to invade.
1440440 1441482 Uh-huh.
1441649 1444329 - Who do you think will win the war?<br />- I haven't the slightest idea.
1444485 1446737 Rick is completely neutral<br />about everything.
1446904 1449157 And that takes in the field<br />of women too.
1449365 1451534 You were not always<br />so carefully neutral.
1451701 1453619 We have a complete dossier on you.
1455371 1459625 "Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.<br />Cannot return to his country."
1460376 1463379 The reason is a little vague.<br />We also know what you did in Paris.
1463546 1465131 And also we know why you left Paris.
1465298 1467300 Don't worry,<br />we're not going to broadcast it.
1467467 1468718 Are my eyes really brown?
1468885 1472096 You will forgive my curiosity,<br />Mr. Blaine. The point is...
1472263 1474515 ...an enemy of the Reich<br />has come to Casablanca...
1474682 1477685 ...and we are checking up on anybody<br />who can be of any help to us.
1477894 1481898 My interest in whether Victor Laszlo<br />stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
1482732 1485860 In this case you have no sympathy<br />for the fox?
1486068 1489530 Not particularly. I understand<br />the point of view of the hound too.
1489780 1492700 Laszlo published the foulest lies<br />in the Prague newspapers...
1492867 1494452 ...until the day we marched in.
1494619 1498956 And even after that, he continued<br />to print scandal sheets in his cellar.
1499165 1501834 Of course, one must admit<br />he has great courage.
1502251 1505254 I admit he's clever. Three times<br />he slipped through our fingers.
1505421 1509342 In Paris he continued his activities.<br />We intend not to let it happen again.
1509509 1512970 Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business<br />is politics, mine is running a saloon.
1513179 1515014 Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
1515681 1518184 You see, major?<br />You have nothing to worry about Rick.
1518851 1519894 Perhaps.
1523773 1524982 Yes, monsieur?
1525149 1529028 - I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.<br />- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.
1556180 1557932 Two Cointreaux, please.
1560017 1562436 I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
1562687 1565731 Victor, I feel somehow<br />we shouldn't stay here.
1565898 1568818 If we would walk out so soon<br />it would only call attention to us.
1568985 1572196 Perhaps Ugarte is in<br />some other part of the café.
1572989 1575750 Excuse me, but you look like a couple<br />who are on their way to America.
1575866 1576909 Well?
1577118 1581414 You'll find a market there for this ring.<br />I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
1581622 1584125 - Thank you, but I hardly think...<br />- Perhaps for the lady.
1584333 1585793 The ring is quite unique.
1587920 1591591 - Yes, I'm very interested.<br />- Good.
1592133 1593175 What is your name?
1593384 1595678 Berger, Norwegian.<br />At your service, sir.
1596012 1597054 Victor.
1597263 1599432 I'll meet you in a few minutes<br />at the bar.
1599640 1602184 We don't want the ring,<br />but thanks for showing it to us.
1602351 1604478 BERGER: Such a bargain.<br />But that is your decision?
1604645 1606355 I'm sorry, it is.
1608232 1610359 - Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?<br />- Yes?
1610568 1612570 I am Captain Renault,<br />prefect of police.
1612737 1613904 Yes, what is it you want?
1614113 1617199 Merely to welcome you to Casablanca<br />and wish you a pleasant stay.
1617408 1620119 It isn't often we have<br />so distinguished a visitor.
1620328 1622747 Thank you.<br />I hope you'll forgive me, captain.
1622955 1626459 The present French administration<br />hasn't always been so cordial.
1626667 1628544 May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.
1630296 1633215 I was told you were the most beautiful<br />woman ever to visit Casablanca.
1633382 1635176 That was a gross understatement.
1635635 1636677 You're very kind.
1636886 1639388 - Won't you join us?<br />- If you will permit me.
1639680 1642850 Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your<br />best champagne. And put it on my bill.
1643017 1645853 - Captain, please.<br />- It's a game we play.
1646020 1649106 They put it on the bill,<br />I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.
1649982 1652777 Captain,<br />the boy who's playing the piano...
1653444 1654904 Somewhere I've seen him.
1655112 1656656 RENAULT: Sam?<br />- Yes.
1656822 1658574 He came from Paris with Rick.
1658741 1660201 Rick? Who is he?
1660368 1662953 Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.<br />Rick is...
1663120 1664664 - Is what?<br />- Mademoiselle...
1664830 1667458 ...he's the kind of man that,<br />well, if I were a woman...
1667625 1670127 ...and I were not around,<br />I should be in love with Rick.
1670336 1673881 But what a fool I am talking to a<br />beautiful woman about another man.
1675299 1676342 Excuse me.
1676509 1678344 Major.
1679887 1683015 Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,<br />may I present Major Strasser.
1683182 1684225 How do you do?
1684392 1686394 This is a pleasure<br />I have looked forward to.
1686602 1689105 I'm sure you'll excuse me<br />if I'm not gracious.
1689271 1691440 You see, Major Strasser,<br />I am a Czechoslovakian.
1691691 1695736 You were a Czechoslovakian. Now<br />you are a subject of the German Reich.
1696904 1700366 I have never accepted that privilege.<br />And I'm now on French soil.
1700574 1704328 I'd like to discuss some matters arising<br />from your presence on French soil.
1704495 1706122 This is hardly the time or place.
1706330 1708499 Then we shall state<br />another time and place.
1708666 1710751 Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.
1710960 1712169 With mademoiselle.
1713796 1716882 Captain, I am under your authority.
1717049 1719135 Is it your order<br />that we come to your office?
1719301 1723180 Let us say it is my request.<br />That is a much more pleasant word.
1723389 1725182 - Very well.<br />- Mademoiselle.
1725349 1727309 Mademoiselle.
1728853 1731939 A very clever tactical retreat, major.
1732356 1736193 - This time they really mean to stop me.<br />- Victor, I'm afraid for you.
1736610 1739280 We've been in difficult places before,<br />haven't we?
1740448 1743159 [CLAPPING]
1744076 1748414 [SINGING IN SPANISH]
1772563 1774523 I must find out what Berger knows.
1774690 1777902 - Be careful.<br />- I will. Don't worry.
1795753 1797922 Monsieur Berger, the ring.<br />Could I see it again?
1798088 1799131 - Yes.<br />- Monsieur?
1799298 1800591 Champagne cocktail, please.
1801425 1804178 I recognize you from the news<br />photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
1804345 1807306 In a concentration camp,<br />one is apt to lose a little weight.
1807473 1810476 We read five times that you were killed<br />in five different places.
1810684 1813521 As you see,<br />it was true every single time.
1813729 1815231 Thank heaven I found you, Berger.
1815397 1818943 I'm looking for a man by the name of<br />Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.
1819610 1821904 Ugarte cannot even help himself.
1822071 1826283 He's under arrest for murder.<br />He was arrested here tonight.
1826909 1828035 I see.
1828536 1832581 But we who are still free will do<br />all we can. We are organized.
1832748 1834959 Underground, like everywhere else.
1835167 1837962 Tomorrow night there is a meeting<br />at the Caverne du Bois.
1838337 1839505 If you will come--
1839672 1841340 SASCHA:<br />Monsieur.
1853477 1855813 Will you ask the piano player<br />to come over here?
1855980 1858107 MAN:<br />Very well, mademoiselle.
1860276 1863612 - How's the jewelry business, Berger?<br />- Not so good. Check, please.
1863779 1865322 Too bad you weren't here earlier.
1865489 1867950 We had quite a bit of excitement,<br />didn't we, Berger?
1868200 1869660 Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
1869827 1873289 - My bill.<br />- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.
1877960 1880254 ILSA: Hello, Sam.<br />- Hello, Miss Ilsa.
1880462 1882965 I never expected to see you again.
1883465 1885259 It's been a long time.
1885467 1888470 Yes, ma'am.<br />A lot of water under the bridge.
1890389 1893309 - Some of the old songs, Sam.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
1896228 1899231 [PIANO PLAYING]
1903360 1904403 Where is Rick?
1905029 1907489 I don't know.<br />I ain't seen him all night.
1908490 1911869 - When will he be back?<br />- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--
1912036 1913787 He went home.
1915331 1918167 - Does he always leave so early?<br />- Oh, he never--
1918334 1920711 Well, he's got a girl<br />up to the Blue Parrot.
1920920 1923005 Goes up there all the time.
1924590 1927259 You used to be<br />a much better liar, Sam.
1928177 1931430 Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.<br />You're bad luck to him.
1934350 1937353 Play it once, Sam.<br />For old times' sake.
1937519 1939897 I don't know what you mean,<br />Miss Ilsa.
1940522 1942024 Play it, Sam.
1943025 1945027 Play "As Time Goes By."
1945444 1948572 I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.<br />I'm a little rusty on it.
1949490 1951492 I'll hum it for you.

2010592 2013429 Sam, I thought I told you<br />never to play--
2024106 2027067 Well, you were asking about Rick,<br />and here he is. May I present--
2027276 2029570 - Hello, Ilsa.<br />- Hello, Rick.
2029778 2033282 Oh, you've already met Rick,<br />mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also--
2033449 2034783 This is Mr. Laszlo.
2034992 2036368 - How do you do?<br />- How do you do?
2036785 2038829 One hears a great deal about Rick<br />in Casablanca.
2039204 2040998 And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
2041206 2043333 - Won't you join us for a drink?<br />- Rick never--
2043500 2045377 RICK: Thanks, I will.<br />- Well...
2045544 2048464 ...a precedent is being broken. Emile.
2049298 2052801 - Interesting café. I congratulate you.<br />- I congratulate you.
2052968 2054470 - What for?<br />- Your work.
2054636 2056346 Thank you. I try.
2057264 2059141 We all try. You succeed.
2059391 2061643 She was asking about you<br />earlier, Rick...
2061810 2064229 ...in a way that made me<br />extremely jealous.
2065105 2066648 I wasn't sure you were the same.
2067357 2070235 - Let's see, the last time we met--<br />- Was La Belle Aurore.
2071820 2073739 How nice. You remembered.
2073906 2076700 But, of course, that was the day<br />the Germans marched into Paris.
2076909 2079661 - Not an easy day to forget.<br />ILSA: No.
2079828 2083582 I remember every detail.<br />The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
2085000 2087586 Yes. I put that dress away.
2087795 2090130 When the Germans march out<br />I'll wear it again.
2090339 2094426 Ricky, you're becoming quite human.<br />I suppose we have to thank you for that.
2094843 2098055 Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one<br />to say it, but it's late.
2098263 2100933 So it is.<br />We have a curfew in Casablanca.
2101100 2104520 It would never do for the chief of police<br />to be found drinking after hours.
2104812 2106581 LASZLO: I hope we didn't<br />overstay our welcome.
2106605 2107648 RICK:<br />Not at all.
2107940 2109525 - Your check, sir.<br />- It's my party.
2109733 2113320 Another precedent gone.<br />This has been a very interesting evening.
2113529 2117449 I'll call you a cab.<br />Gasoline rationing, time of night.
2117616 2119368 - We'll come again.<br />- Anytime.
2119535 2121620 - Say good night to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
2122579 2126625 There's still nobody in the world who<br />can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
2127167 2129628 He hasn't played it in a long time.
2131130 2133090 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
2133257 2134883 Night.
2142766 2145269 A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.<br />What sort is he?
2145477 2148689 I really can't say,<br />though I saw him quite often in Paris.
2148897 2151441 - Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.<br />- We'll be there.
2151608 2153318 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
2192149 2193692 Boss?
2197321 2199281 - Boss?<br />- Yeah?
2199781 2202826 - Boss, ain't you going to bed?<br />- Not right now.
2203035 2204971 Ain't you planning to go to bed<br />in the near future?
2204995 2206038 No.
2206246 2208290 - You ever going to bed?<br />- No.
2209124 2210959 Well, I ain't sleepy, either.
2211126 2212294 Good, then have a drink.
2212502 2214463 - Not me, boss.<br />- Then don't have a drink.
2214630 2216173 Boss, let's get out of here.
2216381 2218926 No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
2219092 2221678 Please, let's go.<br />Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
2221887 2223847 She's coming back.<br />I know she's coming back.
2224014 2225724 We'll take the car and drive all night.
2225933 2228769 We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,<br />stay away until she's gone.
2228936 2233315 - Shut up and go home, will you?<br />- No, sir, I'm staying right here.
2238820 2241323 They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.
2241573 2244993 Well, that's the way it goes.<br />One in, one out.
2245160 2246203 [PIANO PLAYING]
2246370 2248497 - Sam.<br />SAM: Yes, boss?
2248997 2253126 If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,<br />what time is it in New York?
2253669 2254753 What?
2255128 2256630 My watch stopped.
2257422 2259633 I bet they're asleep in New York.
2259841 2262552 I bet they're asleep all over America.
2269351 2273522 Of all the gin joints in all the towns<br />in all the world...
2273689 2275732 ...she walks into mine.
2283156 2285909 - What's that you're playing?<br />- A little something of my own.
2286076 2288870 - Stop it. You know what I want to hear.<br />- No, I don't.
2289037 2291206 You played it for her.<br />You can play it for me.
2291373 2294543 - I don't think I can remember--<br />- If she can stand it, I can.
2294751 2295794 Play it.

2444151 2447863 I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
2448655 2450282 Well, I was wondering...
2450824 2451950 Yes?
2452117 2456496 Why I'm so lucky. Why I should<br />find you waiting for me to come along.
2457581 2461668 - Why there is no other man in my life?<br />- Uh-huh.
2462127 2464379 That's easy.<br />There was.
2466381 2467883 He's dead.
2468800 2470719 I'm sorry for asking.

2970218 2973638 Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come<br />to you as you go along.
2976099 2979894 It's about a girl who had just come<br />to Paris from her home in Oslo.
2980061 2981771 At the house of some friends...
2981938 2984816 ...she met a man about whom<br />she'd heard her whole life.
2984983 2988194 A very great and courageous man.
2988569 2990863 He opened up for her a whole<br />beautiful world...
2991030 2993616 ...full of knowledge<br />and thoughts and ideals.
2994033 2997912 Everything she knew<br />or ever became was because of him.
2998079 2999831 And she looked up to him...
3000081 3001582 ...and worshiped him...
3001749 3004585 ...with a feeling<br />she supposed was love.
3004752 3006879 Yes, that's very pretty.
3007046 3010758 I heard a story once. In fact,<br />I've heard a lot of stories in my time.
3010925 3013720 They went along with the sound<br />of a tinny piano...
3013886 3016222 ...playing in the parlor downstairs.
3016681 3021728 "Mister, I met a man once<br />when I was a kid," they'd always begin.
3024022 3027775 I guess neither one of our stories<br />is very funny.
3027942 3029068 Tell me...
3029986 3032113 ...who was it you left me for?
3032280 3035116 Was it Laszlo,<br />or were there others in between...
3035825 3038161 ...or aren't you the kind that tells?
3051966 3053801 [DOOR CLOSES]
3063478 3067065 I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the<br />letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.
3067231 3069609 I would suggest you search<br />the café immediately.
3069776 3072820 If Rick has the letters, he's too smart<br />to let you find them there.
3073071 3075114 You give him credit<br />for too much cleverness.
3075281 3077867 My impression was he's just<br />another blundering American.
3078034 3080119 We mustn't underestimate<br />American blundering.
3080286 3084207 I was with them when they blundered<br />into Berlin in 1918.
3084373 3087293 As to Laszlo,<br />we want him watched 24 hours a day.
3087460 3091297 It may interest you to know that at<br />this very moment he's on his way here.
3096344 3099013 There is nothing we can do.
3100014 3102642 I'm delighted to see you.<br />Did you have a good night's rest?
3102809 3103851 I slept very well.

3107897 3110191 - May we proceed?<br />- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
3110358 3112276 Thank you.
3113986 3117365 Laszlo, we will not mince words.<br />You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.
3117532 3119867 So far you have been fortunate<br />in eluding us.
3120326 3121869 You have reached Casablanca.
3122078 3124789 It is my duty to see<br />that you stay in Casablanca.
3125039 3127125 Whether or not you will succeed<br />is problematic.
3127291 3130044 Not at all. Renault's signature<br />is necessary on every visa.
3130211 3132922 Captain, is it possible that Laszlo<br />will receive a visa?
3133089 3135424 I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.
3135675 3137718 Well, perhaps I shall like it<br />in Casablanca.
3138302 3140012 STRASSER:<br />And mademoiselle?
3140179 3143724 - You needn't be concerned about me.<br />- Is that all you wish to tell us?
3143891 3146811 Don't be in such a hurry.<br />You have all the time in the world.
3146978 3149647 You may be<br />in Casablanca indefinitely.
3149814 3151732 Or you may leave<br />for Lisbon tomorrow.
3151899 3154110 - On one condition.<br />- And that is?
3154402 3157572 You know the leader of the underground<br />movement in Paris, in Prague...
3157780 3159115 ...Brussels, Amsterdam...
3159323 3161576 ...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...
3161784 3164370 - Even Berlin.<br />- Yes, even in Berlin.
3164537 3167165 If you will furnish me with their names<br />and whereabouts...
3167331 3169083 ...you'll have your visa in the morning.
3169375 3172044 And the honor of having served<br />the Third Reich.
3172753 3174922 I was in a German concentration camp<br />for a year.
3175423 3178885 - That's honor enough for a lifetime.<br />- You will give us the names?
3180428 3182930 If I didn't give them to you<br />in a concentration camp...
3183139 3186058 ...where you had more persuasive<br />methods at your disposal...
3186267 3188853 ...I certainly won't<br />give them to you now.
3189312 3191689 And what if you track down<br />these men and kill them?
3191898 3193441 What if you murdered all of us?
3193608 3197945 From every corner of Europe, hundreds,<br />thousands would rise to take our places.
3198112 3200448 Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
3200615 3204160 Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for<br />eloquence which I can now understand.
3204327 3205953 But in one aspect you are mistaken.
3206120 3208664 You said the enemies<br />of the Reich could all be replaced.
3208831 3210374 But there is one exception.
3210583 3213169 No one could take your place<br />if anything unfortunate...
3213336 3216255 ...should occur to you<br />while you were trying to escape.
3216631 3218966 You won't dare<br />to interfere with me here.
3219133 3220676 This is still unoccupied France.
3221135 3223971 Any violation of neutrality<br />would reflect on Captain Renault.
3224138 3226849 - Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.<br />- Thank you.
3227016 3231145 By the way, monsieur, last night<br />you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
3231562 3235650 - Yes?<br />- I believe you have a message for him?
3235816 3238069 Nothing important.<br />But may I speak to him now?
3238611 3241656 You would find the conversation<br />a trifle one-sided.
3241822 3243658 Signor Ugarte is dead.
3250289 3251791 I'm making out the report now.
3251958 3254543 We haven't quite decided<br />whether he committed suicide...
3255211 3257088 ...or died trying to escape.
3258714 3261425 - Are you quite finished with us?<br />- For the time being.
3261634 3263135 Good day.
3267515 3270142 Undoubtedly, their next step will<br />be to the black market.
3270309 3271352 Excuse me, captain.
3271560 3274563 Another visa problem has come up.
3275022 3277942 - Show her in.<br />- Yes, sir.
3286617 3289662 Sorry, monsieur, we were never<br />to handle the police.
3289829 3292581 - This is a job for Signor Ferrari.<br />- Ferrari?
3292748 3294959 It can be most helpful<br />to know Signor Ferrari.
3295126 3297753 He pretty near has a monopoly<br />on the black market here.
3297962 3300047 You will find him at the Blue Parrot.
3300715 3302383 MAN:<br />Thanks.
3314228 3315604 FERRARI:<br />Don't be too downhearted.
3315813 3317898 Perhaps you can<br />come to terms with Renault.
3318065 3319400 Thank you very much, signor.
3319567 3321986 RICK: Hello, Ferrari.<br />- Good morning, Rick.
3322153 3324322 The bus is in.<br />I'll take my shipment with me.
3324530 3326574 I'll have it sent over.<br />Have a drink with me.
3326741 3328034 I never drink in the morning.
3328200 3330953 And every time you send my<br />shipment over it's a little short.
3331120 3333080 Carrying charges, my boy.<br />Carrying charges.
3333247 3334582 Here, sit down.
3334749 3337418 There is something I want<br />to talk over with you, anyhow.
3337585 3339211 Bourbon.
3339462 3341422 The news about Ugarte<br />upsets me very much.
3341589 3344759 You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel<br />any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
3345176 3347970 Of course not. What upsets me<br />is that Ugarte is dead...
3348137 3350181 ...and no one knows where<br />those letters are.
3350348 3351640 Practically no one.
3351849 3354101 If I had those letters,<br />I could make a fortune.
3354393 3356437 So could I,<br />and I'm a poor businessman.
3356645 3358939 I have a proposition<br />for whoever has those letters.
3359106 3360649 I'll handle the entire transaction.
3360816 3363527 Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,<br />for a small percentage.
3363736 3365237 And the carrying charges?
3365404 3368157 Naturally there will be a few<br />incidental expenses.
3368866 3371285 That's my proposition<br />for whoever has those letters.
3371452 3372995 I'll tell him when he comes in.
3373162 3375790 Rick, I think you know<br />where those letters are.
3376082 3379293 You're in good company. Renault<br />and Strasser probably think so too.
3384965 3388010 That's why I came here. To give<br />them a chance to ransack my place.
3388177 3391514 Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into<br />your confidence. You need a partner.
3391680 3393641 Excuse me, I'll be getting back.
3397186 3398229 LASZLO:<br />Morning.
3398396 3400981 Signor Ferrari<br />is the fat gent at the table.
3405653 3408280 MAN: You will not find a treasure<br />like this in all Morocco.
3408489 3409782 Only 700 francs.
3409990 3413160 - You're being cheated.<br />- Doesn't matter, thank you.
3413327 3416455 For friends of Rick's<br />we have a small discount.
3416664 3419166 Did I say 700 francs?<br />You can have it for 200.
3419333 3422962 I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive<br />you when you called on me last night.
3423129 3424171 Doesn't matter.
3424338 3428300 For special friends of Rick's<br />we have a special discount. 100 francs.
3428467 3431512 Your story had me a little confused.<br />Or maybe it was the bourbon.
3431679 3433305 I have some tablecloths, napkins--
3433472 3436183 - Thank you. I'm really not interested.<br />- Please, one minute.
3436350 3439979 Why did you come back? To tell me why<br />you ran out on me at the railway station?
3440146 3441188 Yes.
3441355 3443691 Well, you can tell me now.<br />I'm reasonably sober.
3443941 3445484 I don't think I will, Rick.
3445651 3448195 Why not? After all, I got stuck with<br />a railway ticket.
3448362 3449947 I think I'm entitled to know.
3450114 3452324 Last night I saw<br />what has happened to you.
3452992 3456203 The Rick I knew in Paris,<br />I could tell him, he'd understand.
3456370 3458956 But the one who looked at me<br />with such hatred...
3460499 3463544 I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.<br />We'll never see each other again.
3464670 3468716 We knew very little about each other<br />when we were in love in Paris.
3468883 3470176 If we leave it that way...
3470342 3473721 ...maybe we'll remember<br />those days and not Casablanca.
3474180 3475306 Not last night.
3475973 3479226 Did you run out on me because<br />you knew what it would be like?
3479393 3482271 Hiding from the police,<br />running away all the time?
3482438 3484148 You can believe that if you want to.
3484356 3487067 Well, I'm not running away anymore.<br />I'm settled now.
3487234 3489069 Above a saloon, it's true...
3489236 3490696 ...but walk up a flight...
3490863 3492573 ...I'll be expecting you.
3494658 3497453 All the same,<br />someday you'll lie to Laszlo.
3497620 3499371 You'll be there.
3500873 3501916 No, Rick.
3503334 3505586 No. You see, Victor Laszlo<br />is my husband.
3506629 3510216 And was,<br />even when I knew you in Paris.
3514762 3519350 I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that<br />unfortunately I'm not able to help him.
3519517 3521435 You see, my dear,<br />word has gone around.
3521602 3524355 As leader of all illegal activities in<br />Casablanca...
3524522 3526190 ...I am influential and respected.
3526357 3529777 But it would not be worth my life<br />to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.
3529944 3531779 You, however, are a different matter.
3532238 3536617 Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be<br />possible to get an exit visa for you.
3537034 3540162 - You mean for me to go on alone?<br />- And only alone.
3540371 3543624 I'll stay here and keep on trying.<br />I'm sure in a little while--
3543791 3545626 Might as well be frank, monsieur.
3545793 3549255 It would take a miracle to get you out.<br />The Germans have outlawed miracles.
3549713 3551840 We are only interested in two visas.
3552007 3554301 - Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.<br />- No, Victor.
3554635 3556720 You two will want to discuss this.
3556887 3558847 Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.
3562726 3564520 No, Ilsa.<br />I won't let you stay here.
3564687 3568065 You must get to America. Believe me,<br />somehow I will get out and join you.
3568315 3570109 But if the situation were different...
3570276 3572820 ...if I had to stay<br />and there were only visa for one...
3572987 3574321 ...would you take it?
3575489 3576615 Yes, I would.
3577825 3578993 Yes, I see.
3580160 3584081 When I had trouble getting out of Lille,<br />why didn't you leave me there?
3584248 3586417 When I was sick<br />in Marseilles for two weeks...
3586584 3590296 ...and you were in danger every minute,<br />why didn't you leave me then?
3591589 3594091 I meant to,<br />but something always held me up.
3596552 3598012 I love you very much, Ilsa.
3599221 3601348 Your secret will be safe with me.
3602391 3604518 Ferrari is waiting for our answer.
3604685 3607021 Not more than 50 francs.
3611734 3613527 We've decided, Signor Ferrari.
3613694 3617072 For the present we will go on looking<br />for two visas. Thank you very much.
3617239 3619199 Well, good luck, but be careful.
3619366 3622202 - You know you're being shadowed?<br />- Of course. It becomes an instinct.
3622536 3625581 I observe that you, in one respect,<br />are a very fortunate man.
3625789 3628500 I am moved to make one more<br />suggestion. Why, I do not know.
3628667 3630544 Because it cannot possibly profit me.
3630753 3633881 Have you heard about Ugarte<br />and the letters of transit?
3634048 3635090 Yes, something.
3635257 3638469 Those letters were not found on Ugarte<br />when they arrested him.
3638636 3640638 - You know where they are?<br />- Not for sure.
3640846 3643891 But I'd guess that Ugarte<br />left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
3644558 3645601 Rick?
3645768 3648979 A difficult customer, that Rick.<br />One never knows what he'll do or why.
3649188 3650814 But it is worth a chance.
3651398 3654193 Thank you very much.<br />Good day.
3654401 3656612 Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
3656779 3658614 I shall miss that<br />when we leave Casablanca.
3658781 3661241 Gracious of you to share it with me.<br />Good day, mademoiselle.
3661408 3663744 - Monsieur.<br />- Good day.
3670334 3672503 [PIANO PLAYING]
3673170 3674797 - Here's to you, sir.<br />- Good luck.
3675297 3677132 - I'd better be going.<br />- My check, please.
3677341 3681095 I have to warn you, sir. This is<br />a dangerous place. Full of vultures.
3681261 3683555 Vultures everywhere.<br />Thanks for everything.
3683722 3685933 - Goodbye.<br />- It has been a pleasure to meet you.
3686100 3687768 I'm sorry.
3703617 3707287 Monsieur Rick, you are getting<br />to be your best customer.
3709331 3711709 Well, drinking.<br />I'm very pleased with you.
3711875 3713794 You're beginning<br />to live like a Frenchman.
3713961 3716296 That was some going-over<br />your men gave my place.
3716463 3718465 We barely got cleaned up<br />in time to open.
3718632 3720926 I told Strasser he wouldn't<br />find the letters here.
3721093 3723220 But I told my men<br />to be especially destructive.
3723387 3725305 You know how<br />that impresses Germans.
3726640 3728976 Rick, have you got<br />those letters of transit?
3729309 3731437 Louis, are you Pro-Vichy<br />or Free French?
3732062 3736525 Serves me right for asking a direct<br />question. The subject is closed.
3736692 3739319 - It looks like you're a little late.<br />- Huh?
3746618 3748287 So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
3748454 3752207 Who knows? In her own way, she<br />may constitute an entire second front.
3752624 3756128 I think it's time for me to flatter<br />Strasser a little. I'll see you later.
3756962 3758380 Sascha!
3758547 3759590 French 75s.
3759798 3763469 Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.<br />Starting here and ending here.
3763635 3764970 We will begin with two.
3765179 3767598 [SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
3774021 3776231 What did you say?<br />Would you kindly repeat it?
3776440 3779818 - What I said is none of your business.<br />- I'll make it my business.
3785991 3789661 I don't like disturbances in my place.<br />Either lay off politics or get out.
3794041 3795584 You see, captain?
3795834 3798212 The situation is not as under control<br />as you believe.
3798420 3800297 We try to cooperate<br />with your government.
3800506 3802758 But we cannot regulate<br />the feelings of our people.
3802925 3805093 Captain, are you certain<br />which side you're on?
3805385 3807554 I have no conviction,<br />if that's what you mean.
3807763 3809056 I blow with the wind...
3809223 3811642 ...and the prevailing wind<br />happens to be from Vichy.
3811850 3813560 And if it should change?
3813811 3815979 Surely the Reich doesn't admit<br />that possibility?
3816146 3818232 We are concerned<br />about more than Casablanca.
3818440 3821860 We know that every French province<br />in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.
3822361 3825072 Waiting for their chance.<br />Waiting perhaps for a leader.
3825239 3826448 A leader? Like Laszlo?
3826615 3828742 Mm-hm. I have been thinking.
3829076 3832412 It's too dangerous to let him go,<br />it may be too dangerous to let him stay.
3832579 3834373 I see what you mean.
3834581 3836458 [SPEAKING IN GERMAN]
3839461 3841338 Thank you, Carl.
3841547 3843757 Thank you, Carl.
3843966 3845926 Sit down. Have a brandy with us.
3846260 3848679 To celebrate our leaving<br />for America tomorrow.
3848846 3849930 Thank you very much.
3850138 3852891 I thought you would ask me,<br />so I brought the good brandy...
3853100 3854935 ...and a third glass.
3855102 3857104 At last the day's came!
3857271 3860107 Frau Leuchtag and I<br />are speaking nothing but English now.
3860274 3863110 So we should feel at home<br />when we get to America.
3863277 3864945 A very nice idea.
3865279 3868282 - To America.<br />- To America.
3868866 3870450 To America.
3873287 3875122 [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]
3875873 3877291 What watch?
3878125 3881128 - Ten watch.<br />- Such much?
3882796 3885132 You will get along beautifully<br />in America.
3886133 3887885 How is lady luck treating you?
3888093 3889928 Oh, too bad.
3890262 3892139 You'll find him over there.
3898353 3899897 - Monsieur Rick?<br />- Yes?
3900063 3903358 - Could I speak to you, please?<br />- How'd you get in? You're underage.
3903525 3905819 - I came with Captain Renault.<br />- I should have known.
3905986 3907321 My husband is with me too.
3907487 3910198 He is? Captain Renault's getting<br />broad-minded. Sit down.
3910365 3911408 Have a drink?
3911575 3914286 - No, of course not. You mind if I do?<br />- Oh, no.
3914870 3918498 Monsieur Rick,<br />what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
3918665 3920208 Like any other man, only more so.
3920375 3921418 No, I mean...
3921752 3923420 ...is he trustworthy?<br />Is his word--?
3923795 3926089 Just a minute.<br />Who told you to ask me that?
3926256 3927716 He did. Captain Renault did.
3927883 3929968 I thought so. Where's your husband?
3930218 3934514 At the roulette table,<br />trying to win enough for our exit visas.
3934681 3936475 Oh, of course he's losing.
3936683 3939603 - How long have you been married?<br />- Eight weeks.
3940646 3942272 We come from Bulgaria.
3942856 3945108 Things are very bad there.
3945275 3947486 The devil has the people<br />by the throat.
3947861 3950405 So Jan and I, we...
3950572 3953283 We do not want our children<br />to grow up in such a country.
3953492 3955869 - So you decided to go to America.<br />- Yes.
3956036 3958413 But we haven't much money...
3958580 3961041 ...and traveling is so expensive<br />and difficult.
3961458 3963502 It was much more than we thought<br />to get here.
3964169 3968298 And then Captain Renault sees us,<br />and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
3968465 3969800 Yes, I'll bet.
3969967 3972552 He tells me he can give us an exit visa.
3972970 3974388 But we have no money.
3974680 3976264 - Does he know that?<br />- Yes.
3976431 3978767 - And he's still willing to give you a visa?<br />- Yes.
3978934 3981895 - And you want to know...?<br />- Will he keep his word?
3983021 3984106 He always has.
3985023 3986692 Oh...
3987567 3989027 Monsieur...
3989277 3991321 ...you are a man.
3991488 3994157 If someone loved you very much...
3994366 3998578 ...so that your happiness was the only<br />thing that she wanted in the world...
3999162 4002040 ...and she did a bad thing<br />to make certain of it...
4002541 4005627 - ...could you forgive her?<br />- Nobody ever loved me that much.
4005794 4009631 And he never knew, and the girl kept<br />this bad thing locked in her heart...
4009798 4011591 ...that would be all right,<br />wouldn't it?
4011758 4013927 - You want my advice?<br />- Yes, please.
4014428 4015512 Go back to Bulgaria.
4015762 4019975 Oh, but if you knew what it means to us<br />to leave Europe, to get to America...
4021226 4025313 Oh, but if Jan should find out.<br />He is such a boy.
4025480 4028942 In many ways<br />I am so much older than he is.
4029109 4031486 Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca<br />has problems.
4031695 4034823 - Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.<br />- Thank you, monsieur.
4043540 4044833 - Good evening.<br />- Good evening.
4045000 4046293 You see? Here we are again.
4046460 4048545 I take that<br />as a great compliment to Sam.
4048712 4051965 I suppose he means to you<br />Paris of happier days.
4052507 4055677 He does. Could we<br />have a table close to him?
4055886 4058221 And as far away<br />from Major Strasser as possible.
4058555 4061058 The geography may be<br />a little difficult to arrange.
4061224 4062976 - Paul, table 30.<br />PAUL: Yes, sir.
4063143 4064978 Right this way, if you please.
4065145 4068899 I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."<br />I believe that's your favorite tune.

4108647 4110357 No. No, I guess not.
4110524 4112400 Have you tried 22 tonight?
4113985 4115362 I said 22.
4117072 4118907 [SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
4131711 4133046 Leave it there.
4148061 4149896 Cash it in and don't come back.
4152691 4154693 Are you sure this place is honest?
4155235 4159072 Honest? As honest as the day is long.
4162033 4163368 How are we doing tonight?
4163702 4166371 A couple of thousand less<br />than I thought there would be.
4170083 4172043 Monsieur Rick...
4172544 4174588 I-- Oh...
4177090 4178717 He's just a lucky guy.
4181428 4184306 Monsieur Rick,<br />may I get you a cup of coffee?
4184472 4186558 - No, thanks, Carl.<br />- Monsieur Rick...
4190061 4191563 Captain Renault, may I--?
4191730 4194065 Not here.<br />Come to my office in the morning.
4194232 4195901 We'll do everything businesslike.
4196067 4198612 - We'll be there at 6.<br />- I'll be there at 10.
4198778 4200614 I'm very happy for both of you.
4200780 4202908 Still, it's very strange that you won.
4203074 4205327 Well, maybe not so strange.
4205493 4208330 - I'll see you in the morning.<br />- Thank you, Captain Renault.
4208747 4210332 No!
4212626 4215003 [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
4216046 4218965 Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.
4219716 4222135 Go away, you crazy Russian.
4232103 4234981 As I suspected.<br />You're a rank sentimentalist.
4235148 4236191 Yeah? Why?
4236358 4238235 Why do you interfere<br />with my little romances?
4238443 4240278 Put it down as a gesture to love.
4240445 4241988 Well, I'll forgive you this time.
4242155 4244991 But I'll be in tomorrow night<br />with a breathtaking blond.
4245158 4247369 And it'll make me very happy<br />if she loses.
4248036 4249579 Mm-hm.
4251456 4253708 Mr. Blaine,<br />I wonder if I could talk to you.
4253875 4256378 - Go ahead.<br />- Well, isn't there some other place?
4256586 4259089 It's rather confidential,<br />what I have to say.
4261049 4263301 - In my office.<br />- Right.
4264344 4267013 You must know it's very important<br />I get out of Casablanca.
4267180 4270183 It's my privilege to be one of the leaders<br />of a great movement.
4270350 4272143 You know what I've been doing.
4272310 4276231 You know what it means to the work,<br />to the lives of thousands of people...
4276398 4278692 ...that I reach America<br />and continue my work.
4278858 4280277 I'm not interested in politics.
4280443 4282946 The problems of the world<br />are not in my department.
4283196 4284322 I'm a saloonkeeper.
4284656 4288201 My friends in the underground tell me<br />that you have quite a record.
4288368 4289911 You ran guns to Ethiopia.
4290078 4291746 You fought against<br />the fascists in Spain.
4291913 4292956 What of it?
4293123 4296293 Isn't it strange you're always<br />fighting on the side of the underdog?
4296501 4298420 Yes, I found that<br />a very expensive hobby.
4298628 4300880 But then I never was<br />much of a businessman.
4301047 4304384 Are you enough of a businessman to<br />appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?
4304551 4307429 - I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.<br />- 200,000.
4307804 4310348 My friend, you could make it<br />a million francs or three.
4310557 4312350 My answer would still be the same.
4312517 4314686 There must be some reason<br />why you won't let me.
4314894 4316021 There is.
4316479 4318606 I suggest that you ask your wife.
4318898 4321568 - I beg your pardon?<br />- I said, ask your wife.
4321901 4324321 - My wife?<br />- Yes.

4442772 4446776 See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in<br />a café can inspire this demonstration...
4446943 4449404 ...what more will his presence<br />in Casablanca bring on?
4449571 4451573 I advise that this place<br />be shut up at once.
4451865 4454826 - But everybody's having a good time.<br />- Yes, much too good a time.
4454993 4456202 The place is to be closed.
4456369 4459414 - But I have no excuse to close it.<br />- Find one.
4463376 4464461 [WHISTLE BLOWS]
4464627 4465987 Everybody is to leave immediately.
4466212 4468423 This café is closed until further notice.
4468673 4470258 Clear the room at once.
4473720 4475054 How can you close me up?
4475263 4478725 I'm shocked, shocked to find that<br />gambling is going on in here.
4478892 4480810 - Your winnings, sir.<br />- Thank you.
4480977 4482228 Everybody out at once.
4486691 4490612 After this disturbance it is not safe<br />for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
4490778 4493573 This morning you implied it wasn't safe<br />to leave Casablanca.
4493740 4496701 That is also true, except for one<br />destination: occupied France.
4496910 4499787 - Occupied France?<br />- Under safe conduct from me.
4499996 4501039 Of what value is that?
4501206 4504250 You may recall what German guarantees<br />have been worth in the past.
4504417 4507670 - There are two other alternatives for him.<br />- What are they?
4507837 4509797 The French authorities<br />may find a reason...
4509964 4512133 ...to put him<br />in the concentration camp here.
4512300 4513426 The other alternative?
4513593 4515887 My dear,<br />perhaps you have already observed...
4516054 4518348 ...that in Casablanca<br />human life is cheap.
4518515 4519849 Good night, mademoiselle.
4530568 4534072 - What happened with Rick?<br />- We'll discuss it later.
4556970 4558972 Our faithful friend is still there.
4559514 4562058 Please don't go<br />to the underground meeting tonight.
4562308 4563393 I must.
4563560 4567021 Besides, it isn't often that a man gets<br />to display heroics before his wife.
4567188 4570525 Don't joke. After Major Strasser's<br />warning tonight, I'm frightened.
4570733 4572569 Tell you the truth,<br />I'm frightened too.
4572735 4575154 Shall I remain here<br />in a hotel room, hiding?
4575363 4576990 Or shall I carry on the best I can?
4577407 4580076 Whatever I'd say,<br />you would carry on.
4580952 4583871 Victor, why don't you tell me<br />about Rick? What did you find out?
4584038 4586416 - Apparently he has the letters.<br />- Yes?
4586583 4588167 But no intention of selling them.
4588334 4592005 You'd think if sentiment<br />wouldn't persuade him, money would.
4592171 4593756 Did he give any reason?
4593965 4597218 - He suggested I ask you.<br />- Ask me?
4597427 4599596 Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."
4600555 4602348 I don't know why he said that.
4614861 4617614 Well, our friend outside will think<br />we've retired by now.
4618990 4620825 I'll be going in a few minutes.
4622869 4625371 - Ilsa, I...<br />- Yes?
4626664 4628916 When I was<br />in the concentration camp...
4629500 4632045 ...were you lonely in Paris?
4633504 4635506 Yes, Victor, I was.
4636466 4639427 I know how it is to be lonely.
4640511 4642847 Is there anything you wish to tell me?
4644849 4646851 No, Victor, there isn't.
4651481 4654025 I love you very much, my dear.
4655360 4656861 Yes.
4657362 4659364 Yes, I know.
4660198 4662617 Victor, whatever I do,<br />will you believe that I...?
4662784 4665495 You don't even have to say it.
4665662 4667413 I'll believe.
4669540 4670875 Good night, dear.
4672877 4674212 Good night.
4681260 4683930 - Victor.<br />- Yes, dear?
4689227 4690603 Be careful.
4692188 4693773 Of course I'll be careful.
4737108 4740319 Well, you are in<br />pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
4740486 4742280 How long can I afford to stay closed?
4742947 4744240 Two weeks, maybe three.
4744449 4746659 Maybe I won't have to.<br />A bribe has worked before.
4746868 4749120 In the meantime,<br />everybody stays on salary.
4749287 4750663 Thank you, Herr Rick.
4750830 4754167 Sascha will be happy to hear it.<br />I owe him money.
4754751 4757587 - You finish locking up, will you, Carl?<br />- I will.
4757754 4760882 - Then I am going to the meeting--<br />- Don't tell me where you're going.
4761048 4762258 I won't.
4763426 4764510 Good night.
4765636 4767221 Good night, Mr. Rick.
4783863 4787283 - How did you get in?<br />- The stairs from the street.
4787450 4790787 I told you this morning you'd come<br />around, but this is ahead of schedule.
4790953 4792205 Well, won't you sit down?
4792371 4796292 - Richard, I had to see you.<br />- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.
4796459 4799754 Your visit isn't connected<br />by any chance with the letters of transit?
4799962 4802673 Seems as long as I have those letters<br />I'll never be lonely.
4802840 4805468 Ask any price you want,<br />but you must give me the letters.
4805635 4808221 I went all through that<br />with your husband. It's no deal.
4808763 4810515 I know how you feel about me...
4810681 4813434 ...but put your feelings aside<br />for something more important.
4813601 4816062 I have to hear again<br />what a great man your husband is...
4816229 4818231 ...what an important cause<br />he's fighting for?
4818397 4819732 It was your cause too.
4819941 4822401 In your own way, you were fighting<br />for the same thing.
4822860 4825571 I'm not fighting for anything<br />anymore except myself.
4825780 4827782 I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
4832870 4834163 Richard.
4834372 4837917 We loved each other once. If those<br />days meant anything at all to you--
4838084 4841003 I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.<br />It's poor salesmanship.
4841170 4844632 Listen to me. If you knew what really<br />happened, if you only knew the truth--
4844799 4846884 I wouldn't believe you<br />no matter what you said.
4847051 4850096 You'd say anything now<br />to get what you want.
4854308 4857061 You want to feel sorry for yourself,<br />don't you?
4857228 4859981 With so much at stake<br />all you can think of is your feelings.
4860606 4861816 One woman has hurt you...
4861983 4864735 ...and you take your revenge<br />on the rest of the world.
4864902 4867446 You're a coward and a weakling.
4870825 4873703 No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.
4874787 4877748 I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.
4877915 4880626 If you don't help us,<br />Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
4880793 4881836 What of it?
4882003 4884672 I'm going to die in Casablanca.<br />It's a good spot for it.
4891512 4893347 Now, if you'll--
4895725 4897018 All right.
4897184 4899228 I tried to reason with you.
4899395 4901647 I tried everything.<br />Now, I want those letters.
4902023 4905151 - Get them for me.<br />- I don't have to. I got them right here.
4906736 4908613 Put them on the table.
4910448 4911490 No.
4912617 4914702 For the last time,<br />put them on the table.
4915995 4919999 If Laszlo and the cause mean so much<br />to you, you won't stop at anything.
4921417 4923419 All right,<br />I'll make it easier for you.
4925838 4929550 Go ahead and shoot.<br />You'll be doing me a favor.
4934472 4936349 Richard...
4936515 4938893 ...I tried to stay away.
4939268 4941938 I thought I would never see you again.
4943064 4945524 That you were out of my life.
4965795 4967838 The day you left Paris...
4969382 4971384 ...if you knew what I went through.
4973052 4975721 If you knew how much I loved you.
4976722 4979558 How much I still love you.
4993447 4994490 And then?
4996534 5000871 It wasn't long after we were married<br />that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
5001038 5004583 They needed him in Prague, but there<br />the Gestapo were waiting for him.
5004750 5006460 Just a two-line item in the paper:
5006627 5009255 "Victor Laszlo apprehended.<br />Sent to concentration camp."
5010423 5012758 I was frantic.<br />For months I tried to get word.
5013050 5014260 Then it came.
5014468 5016637 He was dead.<br />Shot trying to escape.
5017930 5020433 I was lonely.<br />I had nothing, not even hope.
5021851 5023269 Then I met you.
5023602 5026939 Why weren't you honest with me?<br />Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?
5027148 5030234 It wasn't my secret, Richard.<br />Victor wanted it that way.
5030443 5032945 Not even our closest friends<br />knew about our marriage.
5033404 5036365 That was his way of protecting me.<br />I knew so much about his work.
5036574 5039869 If the Gestapo found out I was his wife<br />it would be dangerous for me...
5040036 5041579 ...and for those working with us.
5042204 5044540 And when did you first find out<br />he was alive?
5045583 5048127 Just before you and I<br />were to leave Paris together.
5048294 5050713 A friend came and told me<br />that Victor was alive.
5050880 5054008 They were hiding him in a freight car<br />on the outskirts of Paris.
5054341 5056343 He was sick. He needed me.
5057928 5060556 I wanted to tell you,<br />but I didn't dare.
5060723 5064685 I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,<br />and the Gestapo would have caught you.
5065728 5067480 Well...
5067813 5069482 ...well, you know the rest.
5072443 5075488 Well, it's still a story<br />without an ending.
5075654 5076822 What about now?
5077990 5079033 Now?
5079825 5081368 I don't know.
5082036 5085081 I know that I'll never have the strength<br />to leave you again.
5086290 5087333 And Laszlo?
5087708 5090961 You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?<br />You'll see that he gets out.
5091128 5094465 Then he'll have his work.<br />All that he's been living for.
5094632 5096133 All except one.
5097593 5099011 He won't have you.
5101180 5102932 I can't fight it anymore.
5104683 5107019 I ran away from you once.<br />I can't do it again.
5110022 5113067 Oh, I don't know<br />what's right any longer.
5113234 5115319 You have to think for both of us.
5116320 5117696 For all of us.
5121325 5123994 All right. I will.
5128124 5129834 Here's looking at you, kid.
5131627 5134713 I wish I didn't love you so much.
5147101 5149186 - I think we lost them.<br />- Yes.
5149353 5151313 I'm afraid they caught<br />some of the others.
5151480 5152523 Come inside.
5156819 5161699 Come, Mr. Laszlo,<br />I will help you immediately.
5161907 5163701 LASZLO:<br />Thank you.
5181135 5183304 RICK:<br />Carl, what happened?
5183470 5185472 The police break up our meeting,<br />Herr Rick.
5185639 5187099 We escaped at the last moment.
5187308 5189602 - Come up here a minute.<br />- Yes, I come.
5189768 5193105 Turn out the light in the rear entrance.<br />It might attract the police.
5193272 5195983 - But Sascha always puts out that light.<br />- Tonight he forgot.
5196692 5198944 Yes, I come. I will do it.
5206619 5210122 - I want you to take Miss Lund home.<br />- Yes, sir.
5221091 5224220 It's nothing, just a little cut.<br />We had to get through a window.
5224386 5226138 This might come in handy.
5226347 5227473 Thank you.
5227681 5230309 - Had a close one, eh?<br />- Yes, rather.
5232311 5235064 Don't you sometimes wonder<br />if it's worth all this?
5235231 5237149 I mean, what you're fighting for.
5238150 5240277 We might as well question<br />why we breathe.
5240444 5241987 If we stop breathing, we'll die.
5242154 5244615 If we stop fighting our enemies,<br />the world will die.
5244782 5247034 What of it?<br />Then it'll be out of its misery.
5247201 5249370 You know how you sound,<br />Monsieur Blaine?
5249536 5251747 Like a man<br />who's trying to convince himself...
5251914 5254166 ...of something<br />he doesn't believe in his heart.
5254333 5257503 Each of us has a destiny.<br />For good, or for evil.
5258003 5260547 - I get the point.<br />- I wonder if you do.
5260881 5264009 I wonder if you know that you're trying<br />to escape from yourself...
5264176 5265761 ...and that you'll never succeed.
5265928 5268180 You seem to know<br />all about my destiny.
5269974 5272559 I know a good deal more<br />about you than you suspect.
5272935 5275145 I know that you're in love<br />with a woman.
5275354 5277106 It's perhaps a strange circumstance...
5277273 5280192 ...that we both should be in love<br />with the same woman.
5280359 5282528 The first evening<br />I came into this café...
5282695 5285030 ...I knew there was something<br />between you and Ilsa.
5285864 5287533 Since no one is to blame...
5287950 5289952 ...I demand no explanation.
5290119 5293414 I ask only one thing.<br />You won't give me the letters of transit.
5293580 5295165 All right.
5295332 5297251 But I want my wife to be safe.
5297543 5298961 I ask you as a favor...
5299128 5302047 ...to use the letters<br />to take her away from Casablanca.
5302214 5303340 You love her that much?
5303549 5306302 Apparently you think of me only<br />as the leader of a cause.
5306927 5309471 Well, I am also a human being.
5310306 5311807 Yes, I love her that much.
5312057 5313434 [CLATTERING]
5319606 5320899 - Monsieur Laszlo?<br />- Yes?
5321066 5323569 You'll come with us.<br />We have a warrant for your arrest.
5323736 5324778 On what charge?
5324945 5327156 Captain Renault will discuss that<br />with you later.
5327323 5330075 It seems that destiny<br />has taken a hand.
5341837 5346008 You haven't any proof, and you know it.<br />This isn't Germany or occupied France.
5346175 5348469 All you can do is fine him<br />and give him 30 days.
5348635 5350262 You might as well let him go now.
5350429 5353432 I'd advise you not to be too interested<br />in what happens to Laszlo.
5353599 5355100 If you were to help him escape--
5355267 5357686 What makes you think<br />I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
5357853 5360314 Because, one,<br />you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.
5360481 5363609 Two, you've got the letters of transit.<br />Don't bother to deny it.
5363776 5366862 And you might do it simply<br />because you don't like Strasser's looks.
5367029 5368906 As a matter of fact,<br />I don't either.
5369073 5370449 They're all excellent reasons.
5370616 5372576 Don't count too much<br />on my friendship.
5372743 5376205 In this matter I'm powerless.<br />Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.
5376538 5381126 You're not very subtle,<br />but you are effective. I get the point.
5381293 5382795 Yes, I have the letters.
5382961 5384797 But I intend using them myself.
5385172 5388717 I'm leaving Casablanca<br />on tonight's plane. The last plane.
5388884 5391970 And I'm taking a friend with me.<br />One you'll appreciate.
5392137 5394098 - What friend?<br />- Ilsa Lund.
5394264 5397851 That ought to put your mind to rest<br />about my helping Laszlo escape.
5398018 5400062 The last man I want to see in America.
5400312 5403482 You didn't come here to tell me this.<br />You have the letters of transit.
5403649 5406819 You can fill in your name and hers<br />and leave anytime you please.
5406985 5409655 Why are you still interested<br />in what happens to Laszlo?
5409822 5414034 I'm not. But I am interested<br />in what happens to Ilsa and me.
5414284 5416245 We have a legal right to go,<br />that's true...
5416412 5418497 ...but people have been held<br />in Casablanca...
5418664 5420290 ...in spite of their legal rights.
5420457 5422292 What makes you think<br />we want to hold you?
5422459 5423502 Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.
5423669 5426338 She probably knows things<br />that Strasser would like to know.
5426505 5428048 Louis, I'll make a deal with you.
5428215 5431760 Instead of this petty charge against him,<br />you could get something big...
5431927 5435180 ...something that would chuck him<br />in a concentration camp for years...
5435347 5437975 - Be quite a feather in your cap, right?<br />- Certainly.
5438142 5440310 Germany--<br />Vichy would be very grateful.
5440477 5441520 Then release him.
5441687 5444356 You be at my place a half-hour<br />before the plane leaves.
5444523 5447025 I'll have Laszlo come there<br />to pick up the letters...
5447234 5449862 ...and that'll give you grounds<br />to make the arrest.
5450112 5452406 You get him, and we get away.
5452573 5455492 To the Germans,<br />that last will be just a minor annoyance.
5455701 5458495 There's still something about this<br />I don't quite understand.
5458704 5461373 Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...
5461540 5463876 ...but you were never interested<br />in any woman.
5464042 5466712 - She isn't just any woman.<br />- I see.
5467296 5469715 How do I know you'll keep<br />your end of the bargain?
5469882 5472718 I'll make the arrangements now<br />with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
5472885 5474094 I'm gonna miss you.
5474261 5477389 You're the only one in Casablanca<br />who has less scruples than I.
5477639 5478891 Oh, thanks.
5479558 5480642 Go ahead, Ricky.
5480851 5483520 Call off your watchdogs<br />when you let him go.
5483687 5485564 I don't want them around<br />this afternoon.
5485731 5487733 I'm taking no chances, Louis,<br />not even with you.
5495240 5497910 FERRARI: Should we draw up papers,<br />or is a handshake good enough?
5498076 5501330 Certainly not good enough.<br />But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
5501622 5504958 To get out of Casablanca and<br />go to America... You're a lucky man.
5505167 5510589 My agreement with Sam is that he gets<br />25 percent of the profits. That still goes.
5510756 5513550 I happen to know he gets 10 percent.<br />But he's worth 25.
5513717 5516678 Abdul, Carl and Sascha,<br />they stay with the place or I don't sell.
5516887 5519306 Of course.<br />Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
5519473 5520807 Well, so long.
5520974 5524019 Don't forget you owe Rick's<br />100 cartons of American cigarettes.
5524186 5526688 I shall remember to pay it to myself.
5536532 5537574 [STEPPING]
5546917 5548919 [KNOCKING]
5561473 5562516 RICK:<br />You're late.
5562683 5565852 I was informed when Laszlo<br />left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.
5566019 5569064 - I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.<br />- He won't be followed here.
5569231 5571316 This place will never be<br />the same without you.
5571525 5575070 I know what you mean. But I've spoken<br />to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
5575237 5577990 - Is everything ready?<br />- I have the letters right here.
5578156 5580325 When we searched the place,<br />where were they?
5580492 5581660 Sam's piano.
5582411 5584597 Serves me right for not being musical.<br />[TIRES SQUEALING]
5584621 5585664 Here they are.
5586164 5587874 You better wait in my office.
5596091 5597426 Here.
5597593 5600137 Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.<br />Haven't you told him?
5600304 5601346 Not yet.
5601513 5603098 But you were able to<br />arrange everything?
5603265 5604465 Everything is quite all right.
5604516 5607519 We'll tell him at the airport.<br />The less time to think, the easier.
5607686 5609521 Please trust me.
5611565 5612816 Yes, I will.
5618030 5622117 - I don't know how to thank you.<br />- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.
5623910 5627039 LASZLO: I brought the money.<br />- Keep it, you'll need it in America.
5627414 5629333 - But we made a deal.<br />- Never mind that.
5629499 5632794 - You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?<br />- No. It's all arranged.
5632961 5635297 Good. I've got the letters here,<br />made out in blank.
5635464 5637883 All you have to do is fill<br />in the signatures.
5638050 5639468 RENAULT:<br />Victor Laszlo.
5640010 5642721 Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.
5645349 5647017 The charge of<br />accessory to the murder...
5647184 5649353 ...of the couriers<br />from whom the letters were stolen.
5649936 5653190 You're surprised about my friend Ricky?<br />The explanation is simple.
5653398 5656360 Love, it seems,<br />has triumphed over virtue. Thank--
5657152 5661573 Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going<br />to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
5661740 5663742 - Have you lost your mind?<br />- I have. Sit down.
5663909 5666078 - Put that gun down.<br />- I don't want to shoot you...
5666244 5668080 ...but I will if you take one more step.
5668789 5671041 Under the circumstances,<br />I will sit down.
5674252 5677756 - Keep your hands on the table.<br />- I wonder if you realize what this means.
5677923 5680092 I do. We've got time<br />to discuss that later.
5680258 5681843 Call off your watchdogs, you said.
5682010 5684638 Just the same, call the airport<br />and let me hear you tell them.
5684805 5687224 And remember,<br />this gun is pointed right at your heart.
5687391 5689476 That is my least vulnerable spot.
5697025 5699986 - Hello? Is that the airport?<br />- Huh?
5700404 5702072 This is Captain Renault speaking.
5702280 5704825 There'll be two letters of transit<br />for the Lisbon plane.
5704991 5706785 There's to be no trouble about them.
5707202 5708245 Good.
5708662 5711164 Hello? Hello?
5712416 5714000 [BUZZING]
5714960 5716002 My car, quickly!
5716169 5717587 [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]
5718004 5719131 This is Major Strasser.
5719297 5721758 Have a squad of police meet me<br />at the airport at once.
5721925 5723218 At once, do you hear?
5730350 5732394 MAN:<br />Hello, radio tower?
5732561 5735647 Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,<br />east runway.
5735939 5738400 Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.
5738567 5742487 Light ground fog.<br />Depth of fog approximately 500.
5742654 5745407 Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.
5757919 5760672 Have your man go with Laszlo<br />and take care of his luggage.
5760839 5762591 Certainly, Rick, anything you say.
5762799 5764926 Find Laszlo's luggage.<br />Put it on the plane.
5765093 5766136 Yes, sir.
5766303 5767345 This way, please.
5769222 5772350 If you don't mind, fill in the names.<br />That'll make it more official.
5772517 5774561 You think of everything, don't you?
5774728 5777189 And the names are<br />Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
5777355 5780942 - But why my name, Richard?<br />- Because you're getting on that plane.
5781109 5782694 I don't understand.<br />What about you?
5782861 5784988 I'm staying with him<br />till the plane gets away.
5785155 5787157 No. What has happened?<br />Last night you said--
5787324 5789117 Last night<br />we said a great many things.
5789284 5791203 You said<br />I was to do the thinking for us.
5791369 5793705 I've done a lot of it since then.<br />It adds up to one thing:
5793872 5796166 You're getting on that plane<br />with Victor where you belong.
5796333 5798877 - Richard, no--<br />- Now, you've got to listen to me.
5799044 5801922 Any idea what you'd have<br />to look forward to if you stayed here?
5802088 5805383 Chances are we'd both wind up<br />in a concentration camp. True, Louis?
5805550 5807844 I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
5808011 5811431 - You're saying this only to make me go.<br />- I'm saying it because it's true.
5811640 5813892 Inside of us we both know<br />you belong with Victor.
5814059 5816394 You're part of his work,<br />the thing that keeps him going.
5816561 5819439 If that plane leaves<br />and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
5819648 5823151 Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,<br />but soon, and for the rest of your life.
5824027 5826112 But what about us?
5826279 5827697 We'll always have Paris.
5827864 5830867 We didn't have-- We'd lost it<br />until you came to Casablanca.
5831243 5832911 We got it back last night.
5833829 5837582 - When I said I would never leave you.<br />- And you never will.
5838083 5839584 But I've got a job to do too.
5839793 5841253 Where I'm going, you can't follow.
5841419 5843547 What I've got to do<br />you can't be any part of.
5844130 5845674 Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.
5845841 5849302 But it doesn't take much to see<br />that the problems of three little people...
5849469 5852180 ...don't amount to a hill of beans<br />in this crazy world.
5852347 5854891 Someday you'll understand that.
5856059 5857811 Now, now.
5859437 5861773 Here's looking at you, kid.
5870740 5872409 [HORN HONKS]
5876913 5879416 - Everything is in order.<br />- All except one thing.
5879624 5881793 There's something you should know.
5882002 5883795 I don't ask you to explain anything.
5883962 5887090 I'm going to anyway.<br />It may make a difference to you later on.
5887257 5889134 - You said you knew about Ilsa and me.<br />- Yes.
5889301 5892137 You didn't know she was at my place<br />last night when you were.
5892304 5895765 She came there for the letters of transit.<br />Isn't that true, Ilsa?
5896182 5897434 Yes.
5897601 5899644 She tried everything to get them.<br />Nothing worked.
5899811 5903315 She did her best to convince me<br />that she was still in love with me.
5903481 5906026 But that was all over long ago.
5906192 5909487 For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,<br />and I let her pretend.
5909988 5911615 I understand.
5911781 5913992 - Here it is.<br />- Thanks.
5914659 5916494 I appreciate it.
5917329 5919122 Welcome back to the fight.
5919331 5921833 This time I know our side will win.
5935555 5937724 Are you ready, Ilsa?
5939601 5940977 Yes, I'm ready.
5944105 5945482 Goodbye, Rick.
5946358 5948234 God bless you.
5949569 5952280 You better hurry.<br />You'll miss that plane.
5970340 5972258 I was right.<br />You are a sentimentalist.
5972425 5975261 Stay where you are.<br />I don't know what you're talking about.
5975428 5976763 What you just did for Laszlo.
5976930 5979349 That fairy tale you invented<br />to send Ilsa away with him.
5979516 5981851 I know a little about women, my friend.<br />She went.
5982060 5984062 But she knew you were lying.
5984229 5986189 Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
5986356 5989609 I suppose you know this isn't<br />going to be pleasant for either of us.
5989776 5990944 Especially for you.
5991111 5994322 - I'll have to arrest you, of course.<br />- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
6001371 6003248 What was the meaning<br />of that phone call?
6003415 6005709 Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
6008253 6010380 Why do you stand here?<br />Why don't you stop him?
6010547 6012590 Ask Monsieur Rick.
6014884 6017721 - Get away from that phone.<br />- I advise you not to interfere.
6017929 6021182 I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,<br />and I'm willing to shoot you.
6023143 6024728 - Hello!<br />- Put that phone down.
6024894 6026771 - Get me the radio tower.<br />- Put it down!
6041786 6043371 Major Strasser has been shot.
6048126 6050795 Round up the usual suspects.
6058553 6060555 [SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
6074486 6076613 Well, Rick,<br />you're not only a sentimentalist...
6076780 6078406 ...but you've become a patriot.
6078573 6080742 RICK: Maybe, but it seemed<br />like a good time to start.
6080909 6082911 I think perhaps you're right.
6107685 6111397 It might be a good idea for you to<br />disappear from Casablanca for a while.
6111564 6114025 There's a Free French garrison<br />over at Brazzaville.
6114192 6117987 - I could be induced to arrange a passage.<br />- My letter of transit?
6118196 6119447 I could use a trip.
6119656 6122909 But it doesn't change our bet.<br />You still owe me 10,000 francs.
6123159 6126037 That 10,000 francs<br />should pay our expenses.
6126204 6128123 RICK: "Our" expenses?<br />- Mm-hm.
6128289 6132502 RICK: Louis, I think this is the beginning<br />of a beautiful friendship.
6151729 6153731 [English - US - SDH]
