235777 238769 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters.
238857 240848 No real ones.
242857 245052 But there are.
251057 253651 She's perfect.
280177 282532 Careful.
282617 284972 Two centimeters.
289977 293333 Yeah. Ready with that amnio.
298697 300176 And...
304897 306535 there it is.
320457 323415 But be careful.
329897 331728 Jesus!
334537 336687 Clamp.
337297 340334 What about her? Can we keep her alive?
341337 343089 How's the host?
344897 347092 Doing well.
349737 352046 Sew her back up.
355417 357612 Excellent work. Everybody.
455945 461099 - How is our Number Eight today?<br />- Appears to be in good health.
461185 463062 - How good?<br />- Excellent.
463145 466421 As in completely off our projected charts.
467785 469855 Look at the scar tissue.
472865 474742 See the recession?
474825 477703 - This is from three days ago?<br />- Exactly.
477785 479821 Well, this is good.
479905 481896 This is very good.
483745 486737 You're gonna make us all very proud.
503625 506059 Don't! I'm all right!
508065 509259 Now try this.
516025 518619 - Hand.<br />- Close.
518705 520696 Glove.
530065 532454 Number Eight?
532545 535457 - Fruit.<br />- Good. Cherries.
535545 538343 - It's unprecedented.<br />- Totally.
538425 543215 She's operating at<br />a completely adult capacity.
544905 547658 - What about her memories?<br />- There are gaps.
547745 550896 Some degree of synaptic dissonance.
550985 552737 She's freaked.
552825 558183 It has difficulties, caused by a biochemical<br />imbalance, causing emotional autism...
558265 560984 Wait a second. It has memories!
561065 563101 Why does it have memories?
563185 565858 I'm guessing, but inherited memories,
565945 569938 passed down generationally by the aliens,<br />like its strength.
570945 574301 Plus a highly evolved form of instinct.
581846 583199 Of course.
583286 588485 An unexpected benefit of the genetic process!<br />I didn't even think of that!
589886 592241 Let's try this one.
595806 597797 Ripley?
599206 601197 Ripley?
602686 604881 Ripley, what is it?
606886 608877 Ripley? Ripley?
614246 617556 - You're not thinking termination?<br />- Oh, boy, am I!
617646 619762 General, this is not a problem.
619846 622440 Ellen Ripley died<br />trying to wipe this species out.
622526 624881 For all intents and purposes, she succeeded.
624966 627116 I don't want her taking up old hobbies.
627206 629640 - That won't happen.<br />- We won't tell her.
629806 633435 Oh, I see. And that's supposed to comfort me.
634846 638725 Identification, please.
640406 642442 Please try again.
642526 644756 Thank you, General Perez.
644846 649795 The bottom line is, she looks at me funny<br />one time, I'm putting her down.
649886 655324 OK, as far as I'm concerned<br />Number Eight is a meat by-product.
658766 661883 Her Majesty here is the real payoff.
661966 664434 - When does she start producing?<br />- Days.
664526 666323 Less, maybe.
666406 669955 - We need the cargo.<br />- I told you, it's on its way.
706686 708597 Fork.
709606 712803 - Fuck.<br />- It's a fork.
716566 718796 How did you...
719966 722400 How did we get you?
723366 724879 Yes.
728446 733645 Hard work. We used blood samples,<br />from Fiori 16, on ice.
733726 735717 Where you died.
735806 738718 We've remade you. We cloned you.
739726 741921 Fiori 16.
743926 746394 Does that ring a bell?
746486 749159 Are you remembering something?
750406 752556 Does it grow?
752646 755399 Yeah. Very rapidly.
757766 761679 - It's a queen.<br />- How did you know that?
762966 765196 She'll breed.
765286 767242 You'll die.
767326 769794 Everyone in the company will die.
769886 771604 In the company?
771686 775998 Weyland-Yutani.<br />Ripley Eight's former employers.
776086 781365 A terran growth conglomerate. They had<br />defense contracts under the military.
781446 785155 They went under decades ago, Gediman.<br />Way before your time.
785246 787714 Bought out by Wal-Mart.
788606 790881 Fortunes of war.
791886 797438 I think you will find that things have<br />changed a great deal since your time.
797526 799881 I doubt that.
799966 805643 We're not flying blind. This is United Systems<br />Military, not some greedy corporation.
807326 810159 Well, it won't make any difference.
811286 813481 You're still gonna die.
815326 817556 How do you feel about that?
822206 824561 I wish you understood<br />what we're trying to do.
824646 830278 The potential for this species goes beyond<br />urban pacification: New alloys, new vaccines.
830366 833164 Nothing like this<br />we've ever seen on any world.
833246 835476 You should be very proud.
837486 839158 I am.
839246 841760 And the animal itself,
841846 843882 wondrous.
843966 848118 The potential, unbelievable.<br />Once we've tamed him.
849846 852565 Roll over? Play dead?
852646 854364 Heel?
854926 856917 You can't teach it tricks.
857446 860802 Why not? We're teaching <i>you.</i>
876286 879437 Hey, son, I'll give you<br />my authorization code.
879526 882757 It's E-A-T-M-E.
882846 885235 Could you repeat that?
885326 887476 Little prick.
887566 891081 You know, no matter<br />how many times you see it,
891166 896240 the sight of a woman all strapped up<br />in a chair like that just...
898326 899839 What?
899926 903282 Just bring us in on a 3-0 descent.<br />And ride the parallel.
903366 906005 - Darling, it is done.<br />- Good girl.
906966 910038 You want anything?
910126 913277 Hm, yeah. How about a cup of coffee?
913366 916403 Anything else while your mouth's warm?
916486 918556 A little milk.
920886 925277 Hey, don't cut thrust till about 600 meters.<br />We'll give 'em a little scare.
925886 927285 Vriess! Call!
927366 929561 Goddamn, we're gonna die!
952806 954797 - Hey, Call?<br />- Yeah?
956286 959562 What has two thumbs, one eye,
960766 962757 a pink tongue,
963806 966479 and screws like a god?
968086 969644 What?
976406 980081 Two thumbs, one eye, a pink tongue,
980166 982885 and screws like a god?
985486 986555 What?
1001166 1005682 Time to enjoy some of<br />the general's hospitality, Christie.
1005766 1007802 Great. Army food.
1007886 1011720 Yeah, it'll do till we get<br />the family wagon up to spec.
1013166 1016203 That is, if the natives are friendly.
1016286 1018800 - How's that?<br />- Good.
1019646 1022365 Are we expecting any trouble?
1022446 1026325 From Perez, I doubt it. But you never know -<br />we've been there before.
1040686 1043325 What is wrong with you?
1043406 1045874 Just a little target practice.
1047246 1049840 Vriess isn't complaining.
1051046 1053162 Goddammit!
1053246 1057398 - Johner, you son of a bitch!<br />- Come on, man, you didn't feel a thing.
1062566 1065444 You are an inbred motherfucker,<br />you know that?
1070806 1073081 I'll take the knife back now.
1077366 1078799 Whoa...
1079526 1082165 Call, forget it.
1082766 1085405 He's been sucking down<br />too much home-brew.
1087686 1089677 The knife.
1092286 1094083 Son of a bitch!
1096046 1098685 Don't push me.<br />You hang with us for a while,
1098766 1102759 you'll find out I am not the man<br />with whom to fuck.
1111526 1117078 It's about time we started associating<br />with a better class of people.
1160521 1162557 I am Father.
1162641 1165394 Welcome to the USM <i>Auriga.</i>
1165481 1168996 Step forward for contraband<br />and weapons search.
1169081 1173677 Please report any infectious diseases<br />to the medical officers.
1173761 1177834 Levels seven through twelve<br />are off-limits to civilians.
1177921 1180640 Thank you for your cooperation.
1180721 1182439 Go.
1185041 1187555 - Hands up, please.<br />- What?
1188441 1190830 Could you get your hands up, please?
1199201 1202079 No weapons allowed on board, sir.
1203201 1205510 My own recipe.
1206601 1208637 Way more dangerous.
1212121 1215477 Nice welcome, Perez. What the hell is this?
1215561 1218951 Are you afraid the six of us<br />are gonna hijack your damn ship?
1219041 1222238 Just the concern that<br />one of your asshole crew members
1222321 1226997 is gonna get drunk and put a bullet through<br />the hull. We happen to be in space.
1227081 1228639 No shit.
1228721 1230712 How you been?
1238081 1240276 Wanna check the chair?
1245121 1248477 Elgyn, these were very, very hard to come by.
1248561 1250517 So was our cargo.
1250961 1254317 You're not about to plead poverty on me,<br />are you, General?
1254401 1257518 No. I'm just saying,<br />very few people deal in cash nowadays.
1257601 1262152 Just the ones don't like to keep<br />business records. Yourself, for example.
1262241 1264880 - Drink, Elgyn?<br />- Constantly.
1269281 1273274 I'm gonna take a wild guess here, General,<br />but I'm thinking
1274001 1279598 whatever you got going on here,<br />it ain't exactly approved by Congress.
1280601 1285550 Who's the new filly<br />you got on board, Elgyn?
1285641 1287040 Call?
1287121 1289635 Little girl playing pirates?
1292825 1294895 She is severely fuckable, ain't she?
1302469 1305859 Mighty handy with a monkey wrench, too,<br />I might add.
1305949 1309339 I think Vriess has got<br />a bit of a light in his eye for her.
1309429 1313980 Fine little ass like that make a man walk,<br />you know what I mean?
1317389 1322702 Mind you, I think she's just a tad curious<br />about this transaction of ours.
1322829 1327505 I can't say as I blame her.<br />It's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff.
1328549 1331143 It's a military operation.
1331229 1332901 Really?
1332989 1338017 Correct me if I'm wrong,<br />but I was under the impression that
1338109 1342421 most army medical labs don't operate<br />outside of regulated space.
1342509 1344943 What do you want?<br />What can I do for you?
1345029 1346860 - Me?<br />- Yeah.
1346949 1348940 Two days' bed and board.
1349029 1353944 Vriess might want to snag a part or two.<br />I mean, if it's not imposing.
1354029 1356782 I don't see any problem.
1356869 1360179 - A couple of conditions, though.<br />- Ah, conditions.
1362269 1368663 Not you, nor any of your<br />formidable crew members,
1369189 1372818 will go anywhere near restricted areas.
1373429 1375420 Rule number two.
1377069 1380823 - No trouble. Good behavior.<br />- Good behavior.
1381309 1383539 - No fights.<br />- No fights?
1383629 1387099 - No fights.<br />- No fights.
1388549 1390824 <i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>
1414281 1418433 Please direct cargo to medlab center, area G.
1419521 1421830 Follow the lit path.
1421921 1424196 Do not deviate.
1434721 1437110 Cargo status stable.
1437201 1439795 Life forms intact.
1439881 1442441 Stasis uninterrupted.
1454321 1458553 Medlab center is off-limits to civilians.
1458641 1460632 Thank you.
1530801 1534111 - Oh, please.<br />- You know I can't lay off the tall ones.
1534201 1535839 How ya doin'?
1535921 1539277 How about a little one-on-one?<br />Whaddaya say?
1544921 1547674 You got some moves on you, girl.
1569921 1574836 If you don't wanna play basketball,<br />I know some other indoor sports.
1585681 1588036 Come on, now, give me the ball.
1598601 1601513 OK... I got a new game.
1601921 1602831 Tag.
1617361 1618510 Ripley!
1618801 1619950 Ripley.
1626561 1628870 You've had enough fun.
1631721 1633757 What the hell are you?
1643561 1645552 Something of a predator, isn't she?
1645641 1649554 Yes, she continues to make us all very proud.
1721761 1727233 There's just one minute and 30 seconds left<br />to order this collector's item.
1727321 1731872 Jesus Christ, Johner,<br />what did you put in this shit? Battery acid?
1731961 1733155 Just for color.
1855961 1858759 So, we're a fast learner.
1860681 1864071 This is a really good show, man.
1880721 1884157 Woman, that shit is not easy to come by!
1884241 1887233 Why don't you take a walk outside?
1892361 1892952 Great!
1893041 1895601 I'm so sorry.
1895681 1901711 If bitches can't handle this shit,<br />they should stay away from this shit!
1924561 1927200 Identification, please.
1931961 1933952 Please try again.
1937521 1940035 Please try again.
1942641 1945109 Thank you, General Perez.
1979041 1980315 Well?
1983041 1985839 Are you gonna kill me, or what?
1987281 1989272 There's no point, is there?
1989361 1991556 They've taken it out of you.
1991641 1994713 Where is it? Is it on the ship?
1996361 1998556 You mean my "baby"?
2000201 2005116 I don't get it. If they took it out,<br />why are they keeping you alive?
2005201 2009240 Well, they're curious. I'm the latest thing.
2017961 2021431 Look, I can make it all stop.
2022041 2025351 The pain, this nightmare.<br />That's all I can offer you.
2033481 2037076 What makes you think<br />I would let you do that?
2041561 2043358 Who are you?
2043441 2046831 Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant First Class.
2046921 2048912 Number 36706.
2051681 2054320 Ellen Ripley died 200 years ago.
2055601 2057796 You're not her.
2058841 2061150 I'm not her?
2067441 2071320 - Who am I?<br />- You're a thing, a construct.
2071401 2074313 They grew you in a fucking lab.
2074801 2077361 And now they brought it out of you.
2077441 2079557 Not all the way out.
2085281 2087715 I can feel it.
2087801 2090474 Behind my eyes.
2090561 2092552 I can hear it moving.
2096801 2099235 Help me stop this thing before it gets loose.
2103281 2105317 It's too late.
2105401 2107961 You can't stop it.
2108041 2110032 It's inevitable.
2113001 2115640 Not as long as I'm around.
2115721 2118030 You'll never get out of here alive.
2119001 2121674 I don't care.
2121761 2123513 Really?
2125921 2127912 I can make it stop.
2134561 2137394 Go on, get out of here.
2137481 2139551 They're looking for you.
2150801 2155636 I think you're gonna find that this was<br />very ill-advised. Where are her friends?
2155721 2160112 - They're in the mess hall, sir.<br />- Well, you find them, now. Quietly!
2160481 2165760 - What the hell is goin' on here?<br />- Smells like a double-cross, boss.
2165841 2168992 Where's the other one? With the chair?
2169081 2172198 Don't ever touch me. Ever!
2173001 2176471 - Wanna tell us what this is?<br />- Wanna tell me who you're working for?
2176561 2179758 - Wren, they got nothing to do with this.<br />- To do with what?
2179841 2182639 Do you know the penalties<br />for terrorist activity?
2182721 2185633 No terrorists in my crew.<br />Call, got something to say?
2185721 2190158 I don't care whether you knew or not.<br />You brought a terrorist on board.
2190241 2193472 And as far as I am concerned,<br />you all die with her!
2195481 2197472 Do you understand?
2199481 2201631 Yeah.
2201721 2203712 I understand.
2206201 2207270 Christie.
2215401 2216675 Freeze!
2224601 2226796 Stop! Drop your weapons!
2226881 2230556 And you, drop that piece of shit!<br />Or I blow his head off!
2230641 2232950 - I can't do that, man.<br />- Drop it now!
2233041 2235430 - They're attached.<br />- I'm not fucking with you!
2235521 2238638 You're all under arrest<br />for a Code 8, concealed weapons,
2238721 2240871 and a Code 12, which is murder!
2240961 2243680 - Kiss my ass.<br />- Put down your weapons!
2249761 2252150 Everybody OK?
2254361 2257114 Real easy, soldier boy.
2257201 2261877 Security! There is a serious problem<br />in the mess hall.
2261961 2264634 You lie to me now, little girl,

2369001 2371720 He's conducting illegal experiments,<br />breeding...
2371801 2376556 - Ice the goddamn mole!<br />- Listen! He is breeding an alien species.
2376641 2379474 If it gets loose,<br />it'll make the Lacerta plague
2379561 2382314 - look like a fucking square dance.<br />- Shut up!

2697361 2701718 - Elgyn, come on. Let's move, man.<br />- Yeah.
2777801 2780998 Elgyn! Elgyn, where are you?
2794921 2796912 Elgyn!
2832881 2834872 Elgyn!
2835481 2836755 Elgyn!
2843121 2844679 Easy, Hillard!
2844761 2847275 - Give me a hand here!<br />- Get him up!
2848041 2850714 - Come on, let's get him up!<br />- Move out of the way!
2850801 2852314 Aw, shit.
2852401 2855199 - What the fuck did this?<br />- What's in this place?
2861561 2863916 - Call, get down!<br />- What the fuck is that?
2864001 2866799 Don't shoot!<br />It's in front of the hull!
2868881 2872157 - What is that?<br />- Come on, man, time to go.
2872241 2873230 Get back!
2876161 2877753 Time to go!
2877841 2879274 Come on, Call!
2879361 2881397 Open the goddamn door!
2881481 2886316 We can't open it! We can't open the door!
2890281 2894479 - We gotta go back!<br />- I'm not going back. You go back.
2918761 2920479 What the fuck?
2922881 2925520 Was it everything you hoped for?
2926601 2928592 Leave him alone.
2937321 2939960 What do we do now, man?
2940041 2943158 Same thing we were doing.<br />We get the hell outta here.
2943241 2945436 What if there's more?
2945521 2949275 I say we stay here, man.<br />Let the army guys deal.
2949361 2953559 - Where the fuck are the army guys?<br />- They're dead.
2953641 2956439 - Then we don't need this asshole.<br />- Step back!
2956521 2958159 - You!<br />- Stop!
2958241 2960880 You got no authority here!
2962561 2965314 Doctor, that thing that killed my partner.
2965401 2968757 - That's your pet science project?<br />- Yes.
2968841 2972072 - Let me do him!<br />- I should let him do you right now.
2972481 2974392 How many more are there?
2974561 2976756 How many more are there?
2976841 2978832 Twelve.
2980481 2982472 Twelve?
2982561 2983994 Twelve.
2986161 2988391 Twelve.
2988481 2990472 There'll be more.
2991881 2996909 So, who do I have to fuck<br />to get off this boat?
2999521 3002831 I can get you off. Maybe not the boat, but...
3004561 3005755 Let's go.
3005841 3009038 No, wait a second.<br />She was the host for these monsters.
3009121 3012238 Wren cloned her<br />because she had one inside her.
3012321 3013993 She's not human.
3014681 3017912 She was part of his experiment.<br />She will turn on us in a second.
3018001 3021357 - I don't give a shit what she is.<br />- She's too much of a risk.
3021441 3023636 - We have to leave her.<br />- She comes.
3024121 3027397 - We can't trust her.<br />- I don't trust anyone.
3031441 3036799 If we're gonna survive this mess,<br />we all stick together. Agreed?
3046801 3048439 Hillard, we gotta go.
3048521 3050796 It's not over. We gotta get to the <i>Betty.</i>
3078601 3080592 Make a nice souvenir.
3088971 3092600 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- Did what?
3092691 3094886 Killed one.<br />It's like killing your own kind.
3094971 3096962 It was in my way.
3119331 3121287 Oh, man!
3125411 3128289 Who were you expecting? Santa Claus?
3129211 3132089 I thought you were toast for certain, man.
3132531 3134806 Where's Elgyn?
3138131 3141123 - Shit.<br />- What if they're all over the <i>Betty?</i>
3141211 3144203 All the activity was in the F sector.<br />Why would they move?
3144291 3149240 They won't. If they send anyone out,<br />it'll be here.
3150331 3152401 Where the meat is.
3152491 3156530 Yeah... If we wanna make any decent time,<br />I say we ditch the cripple.
3158371 3161124 - No offence, man.<br />- None taken.
3161211 3163167 Nobody is left behind.
3163251 3165811 Not even you, Johner.
3167011 3171243 - What's the quickest way out?<br />- After the cooling tower, there's an elevator.
3171331 3174607 It runs from the top of the ship<br />down to level one.
3174691 3178730 - Straight to the dock.<br />- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.
3179971 3182280 We're moving.
3182371 3186000 - What?<br />- The ship is moving. I can feel it.
3186491 3190404 The ship has stealth-run.<br />There's no way you can tell.
3191251 3194687 - She's right.<br />- The ship's been go since the attack.
3194771 3197365 It's a standard emergency procedure.
3197451 3201444 That's right. Any serious problem,<br />the ship autopilots to home base.
3201531 3204091 And you were planning on<br />letting us know this?
3204171 3206321 Nobody asked.
3206411 3208720 What's home base?
3211211 3213441 Earth.
3213531 3215647 - Great!<br />- Bastard!
3215731 3219121 Earth? I'd rather stay here<br />with the things, man.
3219851 3223002 - How long until we get to Earth?<br />- Three hours almost.
3223091 3225127 We gotta blow the ship.
3225211 3227884 Call! You're not blowing this ship.
3228611 3231079 Not while we're on it, OK?
3231171 3235528 You get out of the ship<br />you do as you please, all right?
3236051 3239043 Earth, man. What a shithole.
3246651 3248642 It's clear.
3254411 3256402 Hey, Ripley.
3259931 3264368 I heard you, like,<br />ran into these things before.
3264451 3267682 - That's right.<br />- Wow, man.
3267771 3270160 So, like, what did you do?
3273691 3275682 I died.
3300891 3302961 Not that way!
3308251 3310242 Ripley.
3316211 3318202 Ripley, come on.
3320451 3323363 Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing here.
3327731 3330006 Ripley, don't.
3446451 3448442 Kill...
3449011 3450000 me.
3459771 3461966 Kill me.
3559571 3561766 Don't do it, Ripley.
3568811 3570802 Don't do what?
3582371 3584965 What's the big deal, man?
3585051 3587042 Fuckin' waste of ammo.
3587131 3589122 Let's go.
3590731 3592801 Must be a chick thing.
3659771 3663002 Am I dreaming, or is this not<br />the shit we brought with us?
3663091 3665605 Yeah. It's the same shit.
3666491 3669961 It stinks in here, man. Let's keep moving.
3698531 3700726 Get away from me!
3700811 3702210 Get away!
3702291 3704122 Get away from me!
3704211 3706008 - Drop the rod.<br />- Get away from me!
3706091 3709288 - Do it!<br />- Get away from me.
3711251 3714084 Get away from me.
3714171 3716321 Who are you people?
3716851 3719365 - What's happening here?<br />- Calm down.
3719451 3724047 What's happening here is that<br />we're getting the fuck off this ghost ship, OK?
3724131 3726122 Ship? What ship?
3727371 3729362 Where am I?
3729451 3733046 I was in cryo, right?<br />On my way to Xarem, right?
3733131 3735599 Work crew for the nickel refinery, right?
3735691 3738888 I wake up...<br />I know I don't understand.
3740411 3742367 Oh, God. I...
3742451 3745284 I saw... I saw horrible things.
3745971 3750010 Look, you're coming with us.<br />It's too dangerous for you here.
3759891 3761483 Leave him.
3761571 3764483 Fuck you! We're not leaving him here.
3764571 3768325 He's got one inside of him. I can smell it.
3771171 3772889 Inside me?
3774531 3776999 Inside me? What's inside me?
3777091 3780322 I don't want one of those things<br />birthing anywhere near my ass.
3780411 3784199 - It's a bad risk.<br />- What's inside me?
3784291 3788000 - We can't just leave him here.<br />- You came here to stop 'em spreading.
3788091 3790651 - What's inside me?<br />- Can't you stop it?
3790731 3794690 - We've got no time.<br />- We can't do it here. The lab's out of order.
3794771 3795999 I could do him.
3799142 3800814 What's inside me?
3802832 3804902 What's in-fucking-side me?
3804992 3807142 A parasite!
3809112 3811387 A foreign element.
3815752 3818789 There's a monster in your chest.
3818872 3821909 These guys hijacked your ship,
3821992 3826702 and they sold your cryotube to this human.
3826792 3829260 And he put an alien inside of you.
3829912 3831903 It's a really nasty one.
3832752 3836870 And in a few hours, it will burst its way<br />through your ribcage,
3837632 3839429 and you're gonna die.
3844912 3847301 Any questions?
3853192 3855069 Who are you?
3856632 3859590 I'm the monster's mother.
3862472 3865782 If we freeze him on the <i>Betty,</i><br />the doctor can remove it later.
3865872 3869182 - Fine by me.<br />- Since when were you in goddamn charge?
3869272 3871263 Since you were born without balls!
3871352 3873502 Ease off, people!
3881192 3885026 All right, you come with us.<br />You might even live.
3885432 3888105 Get twitchy on me, you'll be shot.
3888872 3890863 Let's move out.
3901232 3903792 It's a mess down there. Is this the only way?
3903872 3906750 Vriess! We gotta lose the chair.
3909352 3911343 I know.
3911432 3915505 - Kawlang maneuver, right?<br />- Yeah. Just like old times.
3915592 3917583 Yeah.
3921232 3923462 Must be the cooling tanks.
3923552 3925941 Somebody must have opened the valves.
3926072 3928870 The nasties couldn't do that, could they?
3940072 3942586 We're at the bottom of the ship.
3942672 3945789 We have to go through the kitchen.<br />Maybe 90ft.
3945872 3948306 To the elevator on the other side.
3949712 3952431 - I don't like it.<br />- What's to like?
3953992 3957951 - This sucks!<br />- Wren, are you sure about the distance?
3958032 3959306 Yes!
3960432 3963629 - You ready to get wet, partner?<br />- Yeah.
3971432 3974981 Hey, will your weapons fly underwater?
3975072 3977461 They're disposables. They can take it.
3977552 3978951 Disposables?
3983192 3985501 Hey, I heard about those.
3987392 3990270 - How many rounds?<br />- 20.
3990352 3994789 Split points give you a good hole,<br />even if it's smaller caliber.
3994872 3996021 That's cool!
3997792 4000864 They're big with hitters<br />cos you throw 'em away after the job.
4000952 4003864 I wouldn't like to throw away a weapon<br />I'm attached to.
4003952 4005590 Yeah.
4005672 4009301 Guess I don't have to tell everyone<br />to take a deep breath.
4016840 4020196 When we hit the surface, no backstroke, OK?
4225720 4227517 Jesus Christ!
4239360 4242989 They set a goddamn trap.<br />It's a goddamn ambush!
4306480 4308072 Distephano!
4327520 4330637 It won't break.<br />Give me your weapon.
4331600 4334114 You really are way too trusting.
4334200 4335349 No!
4344920 4346319 No!
4354520 4357432 You killed her! You bastard!
4362120 4364190 I'll get you!
4365920 4367911 Father, lock the door!
4382800 4385553 Christie! Climb!
4385640 4387153 Climb! Come on!
4387520 4389351 Come on!
4389440 4392113 It's jammed! Move it!
4392200 4394191 It's jammed!
4425560 4427869 Get off my foot, bitch!
4440120 4441917 Johner!
4442000 4444070 Get off me!
4445560 4446515 Johner!
4451080 4453071 Die, motherfucker!
4455040 4456758 Do it, man!
4473160 4475515 Real nice party, ain't it?
4502960 4504109 Christie!
4504880 4506359 Christie!
4507360 4508554 Christie!
4508640 4510119 No!
4510200 4511838 Christie!
4512520 4514397 Christie!
4514480 4517836 What are you doing? Don't do it!
4517920 4519148 Don't!
4519240 4521231 We can make it!
4522120 4523678 No!
4527840 4529831 Damn!
4574840 4576831 This way.
4579040 4580075 Come on!
4585960 4587951 Baby, am I glad to see you!
4588040 4590713 I was sure that asshole got you. Are you hurt?
4590800 4592791 I'm fine.
4592880 4596111 - You got body armor on?<br />- Yeah. Come on.
4596200 4598919 You took it in the chest. I saw it.
4619800 4621791 You're a robot?
4622840 4626230 Son of a bitch! Our little Call<br />is just full of surprises.
4626320 4630233 I should've known.<br />No human being is that humane.
4630320 4632754 I thought synthetics were logical.
4632840 4635195 You just a big old psycho, girl!
4635280 4638716 - You're a robot?<br />- You're a Second Gen, aren't you?
4639880 4641950 You're an Auton.
4642040 4645032 Robots designed by robots, right?
4645120 4648078 - Ha!<br />- That's right, I remember.
4648160 4651038 They were meant to revitalize<br />the synthetic industry.
4651120 4653156 Instead they buried it.
4653920 4656354 They don't like being told what to do.
4656440 4658556 The government ordered a recall.
4658640 4660631 Now, I heard...
4660720 4663951 I heard that only a few<br />had gotten out in time.
4664080 4667152 Man, I never thought that I would see one!
4667240 4670516 Great. She's a toaster oven.
4671200 4673191 Can we leave now?
4675000 4678197 - How long before we land?<br />- Two hours.
4678280 4681670 Vriess, you got a wrench?<br />Maybe she just needs an oil change.
4681760 4683716 Sorry. Access denied.
4683800 4687634 - And I almost fucked it.<br />- Like you never fucked a robot!
4687720 4690439 If Wren gets in the computer,<br />he could screw us.
4690520 4693717 - We gotta find a terminal.<br />- There's no console on this level.
4693800 4696519 - We'd have to go back.<br />- We can't go back.
4696600 4699717 - And I don't know Wren's access codes.<br />- Help me.
4701320 4702878 Call...
4703840 4705831 No. I can't.
4705920 4709993 Right. You're the new model droid.<br />You can access the mainframe by remote.
4710080 4713675 No, I can't.<br />I burned my modem. We all did.
4713760 4717469 Call, you can still patch in manually.<br />You know that.
4718200 4721397 There's ports in the chapel, up there.
4722560 4724073 Call...
4729240 4732789 - You're programmed for that?<br />- Don't make me do this.
4732880 4735872 Don't make me make you.
4735960 4738315 I don't wanna go in there.
4738400 4741073 It's like my insides are liquid. It's not real.
4741160 4745312 Get over it. You can blow this ship,<br />before it reaches Earth,
4745960 4748190 and kill them all.
4757200 4759794 Just give us time to get out first.
4762840 4764751 - Damn it!<br />- Anything?
4764840 4766512 Hold on.
4770680 4774468 Breach in sector seven, sector three.
4774560 4776551 Sector nine unstable.
4777920 4780309 Engines operating at 41%.
4780400 4783517 86 minutes until Earth dock.
4783600 4785670 We burned too much energy.
4785760 4789594 I can't make critical mass. I can't blow it.
4789680 4791238 Then crash it.
4804360 4806590 I'm OK. I'm OK.
4810928 4812247 I feel good.
4814234 4816384 Ground level recalibrated.
4816474 4821264 New destination: 7-6-0-4-0-3.<br />Uninhabited quadrant.
4821874 4826265 Braking system's offline.<br />Deceleration increase.
4827154 4830749 Time until impact<br />now 43 minutes, 8 seconds.
4832674 4834824 Try to clear us a path to the <i>Betty.</i>
4835754 4837551 And start her up.
4866442 4869275 Please wait.
4872762 4876038 Emergency override<br />in console 45V, level one.
4879562 4881678 It's Wren. He's almost at the <i>Betty.</i>
4894602 4897992 Father, locate the power drain. Report.
4900322 4902313 Father?
4902762 4904753 Father?
4908562 4911235 Father's dead, asshole.
4914562 4920080 Intruder on level one.<br />All aliens, please proceed to level one.
4920162 4922153 You got a mean streak.
4926362 4928239 Damn it!
4928322 4930472 - Let me see.<br />- Don't touch me.
4930562 4932792 Come on.
4932882 4935396 You must think this is pretty funny.
4936562 4939440 I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.
4939522 4941513 But I don't think they are.
4949162 4951153 Why do you go on living?
4953522 4955956 How can you stand being what you are?
4957722 4960190 Not much choice.
4963162 4965630 At least there's a part of you that's human.
4966842 4968400 I'm just...
4968482 4969801 Look at me.
4970682 4972832 I'm disgusting.
4974442 4976797 Why did you come here?
4976882 4979032 To kill you. Remember?
4979122 4981113 Before the recall,
4981202 4984160 I accessed the mainframe.
4984242 4988235 Every dirty little covert op<br />the government ever dreamed up is in there.
4988322 4992759 And this, you, the aliens,<br />even the crew from the <i>Betty.</i>
4992842 4995834 I knew if they succeeded<br />it'd be the end of them.
4995922 4998117 Why do you care what happens to them?
4998962 5000953 Because I'm programmed to.
5005080 5007116 You're the new asshole model?
5011440 5013908 I couldn't watch 'em do it.
5014000 5017515 I couldn't let 'em annihilate themselves.
5017600 5019591 Do you understand that?
5022760 5024512 I did once.
5024600 5027319 I tried to save people.
5028240 5030708 It didn't work out.
5030800 5033268 There was this girl.
5035760 5038513 She had bad dreams.
5038600 5041353 I tried to help her.
5041440 5043431 She died.
5044480 5047278 Now I can't even remember her name.
5051800 5053791 I guess we're almost there.
5053880 5055871 Right.
5057400 5062269 - Do you dream?<br />- I... We have neural processors. Yes.
5063160 5066596 When I sleep I dream about them. It.
5066680 5068318 Every night.
5068400 5070675 All around me. In me.
5070760 5073991 I used to be afraid to dream,<br />but I'm not any more.
5074080 5076435 Why?
5076520 5083153 Because, no matter how bad the dreams get,<br />when I wake up it's always worse.
5085640 5088632 - It's not so far now!<br />- God, I'm so tired!
5101047 5103356 Oh, no. This is bad, right?
5103967 5106037 I think we're near the nest.
5106127 5108846 - We'll go another way.<br />- We don't have time.
5108927 5110918 - We got 90 minutes.<br />- Not any more.
5111007 5112759 What?
5112847 5115759 - What did you do, robot?<br />- Let's go. Come on.
5115847 5120079 Hey! You wanna die here with<br />your brothers and sisters, that's cool.
5120167 5122362 But I plan to live past today.
5122447 5124961 If this hunk of plastic is pullin' any shit,
5125047 5127038 I'm gonna kill her!
5127967 5129559 Kill you!
5129647 5133117 Does that compute?<br />Or do I have to draw you a schematic?
5133847 5135200 Hey!
5137887 5140037 You want another souvenir?
5147047 5149720 - How far are the docks?<br />- 100 yards.
5160487 5162478 Ripley?
5163447 5165438 Ripley?
5166287 5168323 Come on!
5168407 5170398 Ripley, we have to go.
5172127 5175881 I hear them. I hear them. They're so close.
5176847 5178917 - Ripley...<br />- It's the queen.
5179647 5182002 She's in pain.
5184887 5186878 Ripley!
5187207 5189277 Ripley!
5189367 5191358 Wait!
5212447 5213800 Oh, my God.
5226367 5231282 We gotta be moving. The best thing<br />we can do is pray for a quick death.
5231367 5234165 Come on. Come on.
5234247 5238559 - It's not right.<br />- I've been saying that all day.
5293327 5299402 Call, I need you to patch into<br />the ship again, and open the hatch.
5308607 5311644 Johner, we should put Purvis<br />in the freezer now.
5311727 5313638 All right, little buddy.
5314647 5316956 Nap time.
5323447 5327679 Nobody moves, or I put a cap<br />right where this little droid's brain is.
5328567 5332765 - Distephano, take the weapons.<br />- Begging your pardon, sir, but fuck you!
5332847 5335122 Fine. Then I kill her,
5335207 5337767 and you kill me, and we all die,
5337847 5339405 and nobody goes home!
5339487 5341478 Now drop the weapon!
5346167 5350683 Then this little synthetic bitch<br />is gonna plug into the <i>Auriga</i>
5350767 5355397 and she is gonna take us back to home base,<br />according to standard emergency procedures.
5355487 5358047 - No, she's not!<br />- Are you crazy?
5358127 5360641 You still wanna bring those things<br />back to Earth?
5360727 5364242 - Haven't you been paying attention?<br />- The intellectual speaks!
5365367 5368643 - Listen, if...<br />- Don't you ever shut up?
5380487 5383524 Why does nobody listen to me?
5424767 5429045 I told you, at first everything was normal.<br />The queen laid her eggs.
5429127 5434201 But then she started to change.<br />She added a second cycle, so...
5436407 5438398 So...
5442207 5444516 this time there is no host.
5445527 5447882 There are no eggs.
5447967 5451516 There is only her womb
5451607 5454280 and the creature inside.
5454367 5460681 That is Ripley's gift to her:<br />A human reproductive system.
5460767 5463964 She is giving birth for you, Ripley.
5464047 5467119 And now she is perfect!
5549887 5551957 You are...
5553487 5559278 a beautiful butterfly.
5586127 5587196 No!
5591927 5593360 No! No...
5645687 5647325 Look.
5647407 5652037 Your beautiful, beautiful little baby.
5653047 5655197 Look, it thinks you're its mother.
5660327 5661476 Come on.
5662527 5664518 Come on.
5672047 5673162 Come on.
5690607 5694043 Civilian vessel online.<br />Emergency departure authorized.
5698767 5703124 All right, she's hot. I'll open the <i>Auriga's</i><br />air locks. Pull the holding clamps.
5703207 5708486 Right, I just need to find<br />the vertical thrust lock.
5713487 5716240 - Are you sure you can fly this thing?<br />- Yes!
5729927 5732521 Launch status is go.
5732607 5733323 No!
5735007 5736838 Ripley!
5764087 5765998 - Hey.<br />- I thought you were dead.
5766087 5768362 I get that a lot.
5768447 5774556 - Why are we still here?<br />- I'm just finding the manual override.
5774647 5776558 - For Christ's sake!<br />- Hey, Ripley.
5776647 5778558 Good memory. Excuse me.
5778647 5780285 - Ripley's back.<br />- Is that it?
5780367 5781197 Nope.
5782407 5784443 You can't fly one of these things?
5784527 5787758 Are you kidding?<br />This piece of shit is older than I am.
5787847 5791123 Goddammit! We still got breach. The hatch.
5791207 5794119 - I closed it.<br />- I've fixed it a hundred times!
5794207 5795640 I'll get it. I'll get it.
5817127 5824078 Approaching Earth's atmosphere.<br />Window of departure now 46 seconds.
5825407 5828205 Call? We have to go.
5829207 5831163 Call.
5833207 5835357 We've gotta get out of here.
5839847 5843635 Window of departure now 20 seconds.
5847007 5850363 Grab on to something, Call. We're outta here.
5865047 5866162 Come on, baby.
5879367 5881961 This thing is gonna fall apart!
5882047 5884197 Pressure's unstable!
5888967 5892084 Go help Call turn on the auxiliary pump!
5918367 5919800 Distephano?
5940007 5941645 Come on! Step on it!
5942247 5945239 Hey! I'm not the mechanic here, Ironside!
5945327 5947795 I mostly just hurt people!
5947887 5949161 Shit!
5949247 5951442 Call!
5951527 5953722 Call, get back up here!
5955287 5957847 Call! Call!
5958767 5959722 Ripley!
5959807 5962367 Hey, Ripley!
5966967 5970960 Johner, where are you, you son of a bitch?<br />Get on it, bastard!
5971047 5973561 - What am I supposed to do?<br />- Grab the sticks!
5988327 5990602 Put her down.
6083487 6085603 Ripley!
6111407 6113238 I'm sorry.
6142087 6146285 USM <i>Auriga</i> will impact in five seconds. Four.
6147167 6148361 Three.
6148447 6149675 Two.
6149767 6150756 One.
6150847 6151916 Thank you.
6175727 6177843 - What's burning?<br />- Us!
6180207 6182084 Shit! You're right!
6259543 6261932 So this is Earth, huh?
6263823 6265814 This is Earth.
6269023 6271014 It's my first time here.
6275223 6279535 I suppose the military'll be<br />sniffing around here pretty soon.
6279623 6282217 Bet you're not too anxious to see them.
6282303 6284294 Not really.
6285263 6290337 You know, a person could get pretty lost<br />around here if they wanted to.
6291103 6293173 What do you think?
6293263 6295982 What shall we do?
6296063 6298054 I don't know.
6299343 6301618 I'm a stranger here myself.
