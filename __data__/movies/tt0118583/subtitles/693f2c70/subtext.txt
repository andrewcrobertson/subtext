2106396 2108314 I can make it all stop.
2108398 2112443 The pain, this nightmare.<br />That's all I can offeryou.
2120410 2122495 What makes you think...
2122579 2124788 I would let you do that?
2128793 2130711 Who are you?
2130795 2134882 Ripley, Ellen,<br />Lieutenant First Class,
2134966 2137301 number 36706.
2140013 2142598 Ellen Ripley died<br />200 years ago.
2144017 2146143 You're not her.
2147479 2149688 I'm not her.
2156363 2158280 Who am I?
2158365 2162451 You're a thing, a construct.<br />They grew you in a fucking lab.
2163495 2165746 And now they brought it<br />out ofyou.
2165830 2168874 Not all the way out.
2175006 2178968 I can feel it...<br />behind my eyes.
2180637 2182638 I can hear it moving.
2187018 2190437 You gotta help me stop this thing<br />before it gets loose.
2193817 2195734 It's too late.
2195819 2198279 You can't stop it.
2198363 2200364 It's inevitable.
2203535 2205494 Not as long as I'm around.
2206746 2209039 You'll never get out of here alive.
2210083 2212710 I don't care.
2212794 2214712 Really?
2217424 2220092 I can make it stop.
2226057 2229310 Go on. Get out of here.
2229394 2231395 They're looking foryou.
2243366 2246952 I think you're gonna find<br />that this was very ill-advised.
2247078 2249622 Where are her friends?<br />They're in<br />the mess hall, sir.
2249706 2252875 Well, you find them, now.<br />Quietly.
2252959 2254710 What the hell<br />is going on here?
2254794 2257254 Smells like<br />a double-cross, boss.
2258840 2261216 Where's the other one?<br />With the chair?
2262260 2264261 Don't ever touch me.
2264346 2265471 Ever.
2265555 2268015 You wanna tell us what this is?
2268141 2270142 You wanna tell me<br />who you're workin' for.<br />What?
2270226 2273354 - Wren, they got nothing<br />to do with this.<br />- To do with what?
2273438 2276357 Do you know what<br />the penalties for<br />terrorist activity are?
2276441 2280277 No goddamn terrorists<br />on my crew. Call, there<br />something you wanna tell me?
2280362 2284239 Look. I don't care whether<br />you knew or not. You brought<br />a terrorist on board a military vessel.
2284324 2287660 And as far as I am concerned,<br />you all die with her!
2289204 2291580 Do you understand?
2294125 2296377 Yeah.
2296461 2298462 I understand.

2320110 2322444 Stop! Drop your weapons!
2322529 2326365 And you!<br />Drop that piece ofshit,<br />or I blow his head off!
2326449 2328867 - Can't do that, man.<br />- Drop it now!
2328952 2331537 - Can't do that.<br />They're attached to me.<br />- I'm not fucking with you!
2331621 2334790 You're all under arrest<br />for a code eight,<br />which is concealed weapons,
2334874 2336959 and a code 1 2, which is murder!
2337085 2339002 Release Dr. Wren!<br />Kiss my ass.
2339087 2341171 Put down yourweapons<br />and assume the fucking—
2346469 2348387 Everybody okay?

2478643 2480602 More than dangerous.<br />Ifthose things get loose,

3047837 3049921 Was it everything<br />you hoped for?
3052299 3054217 Leave him alone!
3063602 3066271 What do we do now, man?
3066397 3070400 Same thing we're doin'.<br />Get the hell outta here!<br />What ifthere's more?
3072027 3075572 I say we stay here, man.<br />Let the army guys deal.
3075656 3077740 Where the fuck<br />are the army guys?
3077825 3080160 They're dead!
3080244 3082203 Well, then we don't need<br />this asshole anymore.
3082288 3084205 - Step back!<br />- No, you step back!
3084290 3086791 - Stop it!<br />- You got no authority here!
3089753 3092463 Doctor, that thing<br />that killed my partner,
3092590 3096092 that's your pet<br />science project?<br />Yes.
3096177 3099512 - Let me do him right now, man!<br />- I should let him do you right now!
3099597 3102140 How many more are there?
3102266 3105560 How many more are there?<br />Twelve.
3108606 3111941 Twelve?<br />- Twelve.
3114320 3116571 Twelve.
3116655 3118740 There'll be more.
3120326 3122911 So,
3122995 3125455 who do I have to fuck<br />to get offthis boat?
3127791 3131628 I can get you off.<br />Maybe not the boat, but-
3132922 3136007 Let's get out of here.<br />No, wait a second here.
3136091 3138092 She was the host<br />for these monsters.
3138177 3140595 Wren cloned her because<br />she had one inside her.
3140679 3143223 She's not human.
3143307 3147310 She was part of his experiment,<br />and she will turn on us<br />in a second.
3147394 3149312 I don't give a shit<br />what she is.
3149396 3152106 She's too much ofa risk.<br />We have to leave her.
3152191 3155526 - She comes.<br />- We can't trust her!
3155611 3157195 I don't trust anyone.
3161325 3164452 Ifwe're gonna survive this mess,<br />we all stick together.
3164536 3166537 Agreed?
3177466 3181636 Hillard, we gotta go.<br />It's not over.<br />We gotta get to the Betty.
3210708 3212875 Make a nice souvenir.
3221135 3223720 I can't believe<br />you did that.
3223804 3226180 Did what?<br />Killed one of'em.
3226307 3229309 It's like killing<br />your own kind.<br />It was in my way.
3252124 3254876 Oh, man!
3259173 3262133 Who were you expecting, Santa Claus?
3262217 3265136 - Thought you were toast<br />for certain, man.
3265220 3267847 Shit. Where's Elgyn?
3271518 3273436 Oh, shit.
3273520 3276105 Hey, man, what if<br />we get to the Betty<br />and they're all over it?
3276231 3279650 - All the activity's been in the aft sector<br />by the barracks. Why would they move?<br />- [ Ripley ] They won't.
3279735 3281652 Ifthey send anyone out,
3281737 3283988 it'll be, uh, here,
3285157 3287325 where the meat is.
3287409 3291621 Yeah. Well, I say<br />ifwe wanna make any decent time,<br />I say we ditch the cripple.
3293540 3297126 - No offense, man.<br />- None taken.
3297211 3300296 Nobody is left behind.<br />Not even you,Johner.
3302549 3305301 - What's the quickest way out of here?<br />- After the cooling tower,
3305386 3306969 there's a freight elevator.
3307054 3310473 It runs from the top<br />ofthe ship down to<br />Engineering Level 1 deck.
3310557 3314769 - Take us straight to the dock.<br />- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.
3316063 3317105 We're moving.
3318565 3320566 - What?<br />The ship is moving.
3320651 3322360 I can feel it.
3322444 3325822 The ship has stealth run.<br />There's no wayyou can tell.
3326990 3328950 She's right.
3329034 3331828 The ship's been go since the attack.
3331912 3334914 That's a standard<br />emergency procedure.<br />That's right.
3334998 3338418 Any serious problem,<br />and the ship autopilots<br />back to home base.
3338502 3340753 And you were planning<br />on letting us know this?
3340838 3342588 Nobody asked.
3342673 3346008 What's home base?
3347511 3349387 Earth.
3349471 3351848 Oh, great.
3351932 3354809 - Bastard.<br />Earth?
3354893 3356853 I'd rather stay here<br />with the things, man.
3356937 3359147 How long until we get to Earth?
3359231 3360940 Three hours almost.
3361024 3363151 We gotta blow the ship.
3363235 3365987 Call, you're not blowing this ship.
3366071 3368364 Not while we're on it, okay?
3369533 3372577 We get out ofthis shit,<br />you do as you please,<br />all right?
3374037 3377665 Earth, man.<br />What a shit-hole.
3385716 3387758 It's clear.
3393849 3395850 Hey, Ripley.
3399605 3403149 I heard you, like,<br />ran into these things before.
3404234 3407653 That's right.<br />Wow, man.
3407738 3411073 So, like, what did you do?
3413994 3415995 I died.
3442272 3444273 Not that way!
3448737 3450738 Ripley.
3457329 3459330 Ripley, come on.
3462751 3465586 Ripley, we got no time<br />for sightseeing here.
3470050 3472468 Ripley, don't.
3591129 3593130 Hel—
3594174 3597593 Kill... me.
3608063 3610106 Kill me.
3710665 3713083 Don't do it, Ripley.
3721676 3723803 Don't do what?
3735899 3738526 What's the big deal, man?
3738610 3740694 Fuckin' waste ofammo.
3740779 3742780 Let's go.
3744574 3746492 Must be a chick thing.
3816479 3819982 Am I dreaming, or is this not<br />the shit we brought with us?
3820066 3822443 Yeah, it's the same shit.
3823570 3826363 Stinks in here, man.<br />Let's keep moving.
3856770 3862524 Get away from me!<br />Get away from me!
3862651 3864568 Drop the rod, man.<br />Get away from me!
3864653 3867237 - Do it!<br />- Get away from me.
3868239 3871617 Get away from me.
3873161 3875245 Who are you people?
3875372 3878499 What's happening here?<br />Calm down.
3878583 3882586 What's happening here is<br />we're getting the fuck off<br />this ghost ship, okay?
3883588 3885506 Ship? What ship?
3887133 3889593 Where am I?
3889678 3893222 I was in cryo, right?<br />On my way to Xarem, right?
3893306 3895849 Work crew for the nickel<br />refinery, right?
3895934 3898811 I wake up.<br />I know I don't understand.
3900647 3905484 Oh, God. Uh, I s- I saw—<br />I saw horrible things.
3905568 3909405 Look, you're coming with us.<br />It's too dangerous foryou here.
3920250 3921667 Leave him.
3921751 3924545 Fuckyou.<br />We're not leaving him here.
3925630 3928507 He's got one inside of him.
3928591 3930592 I can smell it.
3931970 3934304 Inside me?
3936057 3939435 Inside me?<br />What's inside me?<br />Hey, man.
3939519 3942062 I don't want one ofthose things<br />birthing anywhere near my ass.
3942147 3943480 It's a bad risk.
3944858 3948610 - What's inside me?<br />- Look, we can'tjust leave him here.
3948695 3951071 - I thought you came here<br />to stop 'em from spreadin'.<br />- What's inside me?
3951156 3954283 - There's gotta be a process.<br />Can't you stop it?<br />- [ Christie ] Got no time for that.
3954367 3957036 - I can't do it here.<br />The lab is out oforder.<br />- What's inside me?
3957120 3959288 I could do him.<br />Back ofthe head.
3959372 3961749 Painless.<br />It might be the best way.
3961833 3964334 - What's inside me?<br />- No, there's got<br />to be another way.
3964461 3967671 What ifwe freeze him?<br />What's in-fuckin'-side me?
3967756 3968922 A parasite!
3971301 3973343 Foreign element.
3978892 3981393 There's a monster in your chest.
3982479 3985439 These guys<br />hijacked your ship,
3985523 3987483 and they sold<br />your cryo tube...
3987567 3990444 to this... human,
3990528 3993864 and he put an alien inside ofyou.
3993948 3995908 It's a really nasty one.
3996910 4000996 And in a few hours,<br />it's gonna burst its way<br />through your rib cage...
4001081 4003624 and you're gonna die.
4009089 4010798 Any questions?
4018014 4019932 Who are you?
4021726 4023644 I'm the monster's mother.
4027357 4029817 Look, he comes with us,<br />we freeze him on the Betty,
4029901 4032277 - then the doctor<br />can remove it later.<br />- Fine with me.
4032362 4034696 Since when were you<br />in goddamn charge?
4034781 4038117 - Since you were born without balls!<br />- Ease off, people.
4047335 4051171 All right.<br />You come with us.<br />You might even live.
4051256 4054091 Get twitchy on me,<br />and you'll be shot.
4055635 4057636 Let's move out.
4068481 4071483 It's a mess down there!<br />Is this the only way?
4071568 4074778 Vriess, we gotta lose<br />the chair.
4076781 4078740 I know.
4078825 4080909 Kawlang maneuver,<br />all right?
4081035 4084163 Yeah,just like old times.<br />Yeah.
4089127 4091461 Must be the cooling tanks.
4091546 4094131 Somebody must have<br />opened the valves.
4094215 4096884 The nasties couldn't have<br />done this, could they?
4108813 4111356 We're at the bottom<br />ofthe ship.
4111441 4114568 We have to go through<br />the kitchen, maybe 90 feet,
4114652 4117196 to the freight elevator<br />on the other side.
4118656 4121450 - I don't like it.<br />- What's to like?
4123328 4124953 This sucks!
4125038 4128624 - Wren, are you sure<br />about the distance?<br />- Yes.
4130043 4132461 - You ready to get wet, partner?<br />- Yeah.
4141512 4144973 Hey, uh, do your weapons<br />fire underwater?
4145058 4149102 - Yeah, they're disposables.<br />They can take it.<br />- Disposables?
4152440 4155943 Hey, I heard about those. Yeah.
4157528 4160948 - How many rounds?<br />- Twenty.
4161032 4164576 Split points give you a good hole,<br />even at the smaller caliber.
4164661 4167746 Oh. Hey, that's cool.
4167830 4171291 Yeah. They're big with hitters<br />'cause you, uh, throw 'em away<br />after thejob.
4171376 4174503 Nobody likes to throw away<br />a weapon they're attached to.<br />You know what I mean?
4174587 4176255 Yeah.
4176339 4179424 Guess I don't have to tell everyone<br />to take a deep breath.
4185598 4187516 Hey, Christie,<br />do me a favor.
4187600 4190519 When we hit the surface<br />on the other side,
4190603 4193272 no backstroke, okay?
4405234 4407694 -Jesus Christ!
4420666 4422626 They set a goddamn trap.
4422710 4424628 It's a goddamn ambush!
4490695 4492320 Distephano!
4511966 4514759 It won't break.<br />Give me yourweapon.
4517471 4519514 You really are way too trusting.
4519599 4533236 No!
4540786 4543872 You killed her!<br />You bastard!
4548711 4551671 I'll get you!
4552423 4554424 Father, lock the door.
4570566 4573151 Christie! Climb! Climb!
4573235 4574778 I'm doin' it, man!<br />Come on!
4574862 4577113 Come on!
4577198 4579991 It'sjammed!<br />Move it!
4580076 4582994 It'sjammed!
4614860 4617237 Get off my foot, bitch!
4625371 4627372 Get off me!
4629083 4631918 Johner!

4649353 4650854 Hey!
4664535 4666995 Real nice party, ain't it?
4695024 4698777 Christie! Christie!
4700154 4703031 Christie! No!
4703115 4707494 Christie!
4707578 4711080 What are you doing?<br />Don't do it!
4711165 4714667 Don't!<br />We can make it!
4715544 4717170 No!
4719965 4722383 Damn!
4770182 4771724 This way.
4775980 4777063 Come on!
4781527 4784153 Baby, am I glad to see you.
4784238 4787156 I was sure that asshole got you.<br />Are you hurt?
4787241 4789409 I'm fine.
4789493 4792871 You got body armor on?<br />Yeah. Come on.
4792955 4795456 You took it in the chest.<br />I saw it.
4817563 4819272 You're a robot?
4820649 4824319 Son ofa bitch!<br />Our little Call<br />isjust full ofsurprises.
4824403 4828531 I should have known.<br />No human being is that humane.
4828616 4831117 I thought synthetics<br />were supposed to be<br />all logical and shit.
4831201 4833786 You'rejust<br />a big old psycho, girl.
4833871 4837081 - You're a robot?<br />- You're a second gen, aren't you?
4838626 4840877 You're an Auton.
4840961 4845214 Robots designed<br />by robots, right?<br />Hah!
4845299 4847342 Oh, yeah. That's right.<br />I remember.
4847426 4850136 Now, they were<br />supposed to revitalize<br />the synthetic industry.
4850220 4852138 Instead, they buried it.
4852222 4855808 They didn't like<br />being told what to do.
4855893 4858144 Government ordered<br />a recall.
4858228 4860480 Now, I heard—<br />I had— I had heard...
4860564 4863483 that only a few-<br />just a few-<br />had gotten out intact.
4863567 4866736 Man, I never, never thought<br />that I would see one!
4866820 4871074 Great. She's a toaster oven.
4871158 4873868 Can we leave now?
4873953 4876996 How long before we land?
4877122 4880083 Just under two hours.<br />Hey, Vriess.
4880167 4882293 You got a socket wrench?<br />Maybe shejust needs<br />an oil change.
4882419 4886255 I'm sorry. Access denied.<br />I can't believe I almost fucked it.
4886340 4888091 Yeah, like you<br />never fucked a robot!
4888217 4891678 You know, ifWren gets in the computer,<br />he could really screw us.
4891804 4894681 We gotta find a terminal.<br />No, there's no console<br />on this level.
4894807 4897266 We'd have to go back.<br />Well, we can't go back.
4897351 4899978 - And I don't know<br />any ofWren's access codes.<br />- Help me.
4902022 4904023 Call.
4904733 4906818 No. I can't.
4906902 4909112 Right. You're the new model droid.
4909238 4912824 You can access<br />the mainframe by remote.<br />No, I can't.
4912908 4915410 I burned my modem.<br />We all did.
4915494 4919205 Call, you can still patch in manually.<br />You know that.
4919289 4922959 There's ports<br />in the chapel, up there.
4924670 4926170 Call.
4931760 4935221 You're programmed<br />for that?<br />Don't make me do this.
4935305 4937056 Don't make me make you.
4937141 4940977 I don't want to go in there.
4941061 4943855 It's like my insides are liquid.<br />It's not real.
4943939 4946065 Get over it.
4946150 4948234 You can blow the ship<br />before it reaches Earth...
4948318 4950194 and kill them all.
4960664 4963332 Just give us time<br />to get out first.
4966045 4968546 Damn it.<br />Anything?
4968630 4970381 Hold on.
4974762 4977930 Breach in Sector 7,<br />Sector 3.
4979058 4981100 Sector 9 unstable.
4982186 4985021 Engines operating at 41 %.
4985105 4988107 Eighty-six minutes<br />until Earth dock.
4988192 4990568 We burned too much energy.
4990652 4993946 I can't make critical mass.<br />I can't blow it.
4994031 4996115 Then crash it.
4997993 5001329 Yeah.
5010005 5012673 I'm okay. I'm okay.
5014301 5016302 Really.
5016386 5018805 I feel good.

5042371 5044205 and start her up.
5044289 5046290 Okay.
5073694 5075820 Please wait.
5081160 5084370 Emergency override<br />in console 45V, Level 1 .
5088417 5091544 It's Wren.<br />He's almost at the Betty.
5103098 5107393 Father, locate<br />the power drain. Report.
5109938 5113191 Father? Father!
5118447 5121032 Father's dead, asshole.
5124286 5126204 Intruder on Level 1 .
5126288 5130333 All aliens,<br />please proceed to Level 1 .
5130417 5132710 You got a mean streak.
5137174 5139800 Damn it.<br />Let me see.
5139885 5142178 - Don't touch me.<br />- Come on.
5143847 5146265 You must think<br />this is pretty funny.
5147601 5150645 I'm finding a lot ofthings<br />funny lately,
5150729 5152772 but I don't think they are.
5159905 5162740 Why do you go on living?
5165327 5167745 How can you stand<br />being what you are?
5169122 5171082 Not much choice.
5175379 5177797 At least there's<br />a part ofyou that's human.
5177881 5182134 I'm just— Look at me.
5183262 5185304 I'm disgusting.
5187224 5189642 Why did you come here?
5189726 5191811 To kill you,<br />remember?
5191895 5194188 Before the recall,
5194273 5196274 I accessed the mainframe.
5197276 5200611 Every dirty little covert op<br />the government ever<br />dreamed of is in there.
5200696 5204407 And this-you, the aliens,
5204491 5208494 even the crew from the Betty-<br />I knew ifthey succeeded,<br />it would be the end ofthem.
5209579 5211664 Why do you care<br />what happens to them?
5212791 5214625 Because I'm programmed to.
5214710 5217753 You're programmed<br />to be an asshole?
5218797 5222008 You're the new asshole model<br />they're putting out?
5222092 5223509 Come on.
5225721 5228389 I couldn't watch 'em do it.
5228473 5231559 I couldn't let 'em<br />annihilate themselves.
5231643 5233769 Do you understand that?
5237482 5239400 I did once.
5239484 5242153 I tried to save...<br />people.
5243238 5245906 It didn't work out.
5245991 5248326 There was this girl.
5250829 5252788 She had bad dreams.
5253999 5256000 I tried to help her.
5257169 5259170 She died.
5260297 5262882 Now I can't even<br />remember her name.
5267763 5269680 I guess we're almost there.
5269765 5271807 Right.
5272976 5274977 Do you dream?
5275062 5279607 I— Well, we have<br />neuroprocessors that- Yes.
5279691 5283110 When I sleep,<br />I dream about them— it.
5283195 5287490 Every night.<br />All around me, in me.
5287574 5290910 I used to be<br />afraid to dream,<br />but I'm not anymore.
5290994 5293579 Why?
5293663 5295664 Because no matter<br />how bad the dreams get,
5295749 5297875 when I wake up,<br />it's always worse.
5303340 5305591 It's not so far now!<br />- God, I'm so tired.
5305675 5307593 Sleep when you die, man.
5319189 5321398 Oh, no. This is bad, right?
5321483 5325361 - I think we're near the nest.<br />- Well, then we'll go another way.
5325487 5328280 We don't have time.<br />We got nearly 90 minutes.
5328365 5330407 - Not anymore.<br />- What are you saying?
5330492 5334453 - What did you do, robot?<br />- Let's go. Come on.
5334538 5338874 Hey! You want to die here<br />with your little brothers<br />and sisters, that's cool!
5338959 5341377 But I plan to live past today!
5341461 5343963 Ifthis little hunk of plastic<br />is pulling any shit,
5344047 5346048 I'm gonna kill her!
5347092 5350219 Kill you!<br />Does that compute?
5350303 5352388 Or do I have to<br />drawyou a schematic?
5352514 5355141 Hey!
5357644 5360938 You want another souvenir?
5366653 5369780 - How far are the docks?<br />- A h-hundred yards.
5380917 5386213 Ripley.
5387215 5389425 Come on.
5389509 5391802 Ripley, we have to go.
5393388 5395389 I hear them.
5395473 5398184 I hear them.<br />They're so close.
5398268 5400186 Ripley.<br />It's the queen.
5401229 5403439 She's in pain.
5405233 5407776 Ripley!
5408987 5411238 Ripley!
5411323 5413324 Wait!
5434804 5436555 Oh, my God.
5449319 5451237 We gotta be moving.
5451321 5454907 The best thing you can do<br />is pray for a quick death.
5454991 5457743 Come on. Come on.
5457827 5459745 It's not right.
5459829 5462206 I've been saying that all day.
5519514 5521515 It's up to you now, Call.
5521599 5524310 I need you to patch into<br />the ship again and open the hatch.
5535613 5538449 Johner, we should put Purvis<br />in the freezer now.
5538533 5540451 All right, little buddy.
5541786 5544121 Nap time.
5548293 5550878 Oh!
5550962 5553088 Nobody moves,<br />or I put a cap...
5553173 5555299 right where<br />this little droid's brain is.
5555383 5558177 Distephano, take the weapons.
5558261 5560637 Begging your pardon, sir,<br />but fuckyou!
5560722 5564475 Oh, fine. Then I kill her,<br />and you kill me,
5564559 5567561 and we all die,<br />and nobody goes home!
5567645 5570481 Now drop the weapon.
5574736 5576904 Then this little<br />synthetic bitch...
5576988 5579323 is gonna plug into the Auriga,
5579407 5581700 and she is gonna take us<br />right back to home base,
5581785 5584244 according to the standard<br />emergency procedures.
5584329 5587581 - No, she's not.<br />Are you crazy?
5587665 5589708 You still want to bring<br />those things back to Earth?
5589793 5593462 - Haven't you been paying<br />any attention today?<br />- Ah, the intellectual speaks.
5594172 5595964 Stay there!<br />Listen, ifyou don't—
5596049 5598133 Don't you ever shut up?
5610397 5613524 Why does nobody listen to me?
5655608 5659611 I told you.<br />At first, everything was normal.
5659696 5662739 The queen laid her eggs.<br />But then she started to change.
5662824 5665534 She added a second cycle cell.
5668746 5670747 So,
5674919 5678297 this time there is no host.
5678381 5680883 There are no eggs.
5680967 5684678 There is only herwomb...
5684762 5687556 and the creature inside.
5690602 5694354 a human reproductive system.
5694439 5697733 She is giving birth<br />foryou, Ripley,
5697817 5701445 and now she is perfect!
5787448 5790784 You are...
5790868 5793787 a beautiful,
5793871 5796790 beautiful butterfly.
5823693 5826278 No.
5830867 5832326 No. No.
5887048 5889633 Ah, look. Look.
5889717 5893512 Beautiful, beautiful<br />little baby.

6012799 6016384 Yeah, I get that a lot.<br />Why are we still here?
6016469 6021306 Uh, I'm just, uh, finding<br />the, uh, manual override.
6021390 6023391 - For Christ's sake.<br />Hey, Ripley.
6023476 6025769 Good memory. Excuse me.
6025853 6027270 Ripley's back, man.<br />Is that it?
6027355 6029564 Nope.
6029649 6031817 You can't fly one of<br />these things too, can you?
6031901 6035028 Are you kidding?<br />This piece ofshit<br />is even older than I am.
6035112 6038573 - Goddamn it.<br />We've still got breach. The hatch.
6038658 6041701 - I closed it.<br />- Fixed the goddamn hatch<br />a hundred times, man!
