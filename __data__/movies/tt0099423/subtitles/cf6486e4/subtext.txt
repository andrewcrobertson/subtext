36795 39213 Hey! Whoa! Yo!<br />False alarm! Hold it!
39298 42550 It's okay! I'm here.<br />Here we are! It's all right.
42634 44635 Set it down nice and easy, huh?
44720 48681 - Yeah, sure. At the impound. Next time read the sign.<br />- Aw, you don't understand.
48766 52185 Look, I'm just here to meet my wife's plane.<br />You gotta let me have this car.
52269 55063 Yeah, sure. Tomorrow, 8:00 to 4:00.<br />You pay 40 bucks, we give it back.
55147 57565 Don't write it up!<br />Don't write it up! Come on, man.
57649 59567 This is my mother-in-law's car,<br />all right?
59651 61694 She's already mad at me<br />'cause I'm not a dentist.
61779 64739 Look, I'm a cop - L.A.P.D.<br />How about a little team spirit, huh?
64823 66699 Oh, I was in L.A. once.<br />Hated it.
66784 68993 Well, I can understand.<br />I don't like it much myself. Hey!
69078 71579 - That's a plastic fender up there! Take it easy!<br />- Back off!
71663 73748 - I'm doin' my job!<br />- Cut me some slack, will you?
73832 75917 Look, I used to be<br />a cop in New York City.
76001 79295 I only moved to L.A. 'cause my wife<br />took a job there. Come on. What do you say?
79379 82590 Here we are. Washington, D.C.,<br />the heart of democracy.
82674 86219 One hand washes the other.<br />Come on, man. It's Christmas.
86303 90348 So ask Santa Claus to give you another car.<br />Merry Christmas, pal.
92684 95353 - It's all yours, Murray.<br />- You got it, Vito!
98398 101359 - Son of a bitch.<br />- Taxi!
105531 108908 - Merry Christmas!<br />- Excuse me. Excuse me.
135310 137019 Yeah, I know that, Larry.
139106 141691 Snow flurries along the north eastern seaboard -
141775 143818 - Hi. Where are the telephones?<br />- Right over there.
143902 147321 - Thank you very much.<br />- Thank you, Fred. Leonard Adkins is in a warmer clime...
147406 149866 with a story that grows<br />hotter by the minute.
149950 153578 Security was tight today at Escalon Airport<br />in the Republic of Val Verde...
153662 157832 where government authorities report<br />that deposed general Ramon Esperanza...
157916 160960 will be delivered for immediate extradition<br />to the United States.
161044 162962 Only two years ago,<br />General Esperanza...
163046 167300 led his country's army in a campaign<br />against communist insurgents-
167384 170178 a campaign fought with<br />American money and advisers.
170262 172263 Esperanza's fall from power<br />caused ripples...
172347 174265 not only in his country's<br />recent election...
174349 177226 but closer to home as well...
177311 179353 when high-ranking Pentagon<br />officials were charged...
179438 182565 with supplying him with weapons<br />despite the congressional ban.
182649 185109 But mounting evidence<br />that Esperanza's forces...
185194 187445 violated the neutrality<br />of neighboring countries...
187529 189697 made Congress withhold funds -
189781 192241 funds which Esperanza<br />is accused of replacing...
192326 194994 by going into the lucrative<br />business of cocaine smuggling.
195078 196704 Although Esperanza was removed...
196788 198831 as commander in chief<br />earlier this year...
198916 202793 the agreement to extradite him<br />was not reached until yesterday.
202878 206339 And Washington insiders say<br />it was a phone call that made it happen -
206423 208424 a phone call from a -
212846 214847 All right. All right.
218310 221312 If I could find a phone,<br />I'd call you, whoever you are.
252469 254387 Bye.
254471 257056 Excuse me.<br />Thank you.
257140 260851 Is Henry there? Hello?
264231 267066 Yeah, this is Lieutenant McClane.<br />Somebody there just beep me?
267150 269402 - I'd like to think I'm somebody.<br />- Honey!
269486 272947 What are you doin'?<br />Where are you? Did you land yet?
273031 274949 Honey, it's the '90s, remember?
275033 278286 Microchips, microwaves,<br />faxes, air phones.
278370 281163 Yeah, well, as far as I'm concerned...
281248 283249 progress peaked<br />with frozen pizza.
283333 287253 Listen, um, we're gonna be about<br />half an hour late landing, okay?
287337 290131 I just wanted to let you know.<br />The kids okay?
290215 294051 Well, they're about to lose their minds<br />from all the sugar your parents are givin' 'em.
294136 297680 Did Mom give you a hard time<br />about borrowing her new car?
297764 300433 No. Not yet.
300517 303185 Listen, honey, when you land,<br />can we - can we just, like...
303270 306314 you know, rent a car,<br />check into a hotel?
306398 308149 We'll leave the kids<br />with your parents...
308233 311152 order some room service,<br />a bottle of champagne.
311236 314739 - What do you say?<br />- You're on, Lieutenant.
314823 317325 I'll see you in about<br />a half an hour, honey.
317409 319535 I love you. Bye.
323123 325875 Isn't technology wonderful?
327419 330379 - My husband doesn't think so.<br />- Well, I do.
330464 334467 I used to carry around<br />those awful Mace things.
334551 336552 Now...
337971 341265 I zap any bastard<br />that screws with me.
343894 347063 I tried it on my little dog.
347147 350399 Poor thing limped for a week.
357240 359325 Excuse me.
360452 362536 Boy, you look really familiar to me.
362621 365039 I get that a lot.<br />I've been on TV.
365123 367958 Yeah. Me too.
391817 394110 - Grab the tools, will you?<br />- You got it.
394194 397530 This is Amy Nichole reporting live<br />from Escalon Airport...
397614 399532 where deposed general<br />Ramon Esperanza...
399616 402159 has just arrived<br />under heavy guard.
402244 405037 Strangely, the deposed<br />dictator's mood seems jubilant.
405122 407623 He is smiling and waving to the crowd...
407707 409792 like a man running<br />for political office.
411294 413963 ...thousands of political<br />prisoners in the past decade...
414047 416048 including the new president...
416133 421554 and there's no doubt that he still has some<br />ardent supporters both here and abroad.
421638 424056 Rumors abound on Capitol Hill<br />that there were other -
426893 428894 - Yeah?<br />- Sorry to bother you, sir.
428979 432273 We're checking our equipment. Any problems<br />with the conduit line in your backyard?
432357 434275 Gee, I don't know<br />anything about that.
434359 436277 Would you mind<br />if we take a look?
436361 438362 Help yourself.
449082 452626 It just don't seem right somehow -<br />closing down this church.
452711 456839 Oh, I know the parish is gonna keep on<br />usin' it, but it won't be the same.
456923 460301 Been here a lot of years,<br />and I've been right here with it.
460385 464221 Yeah, I kind of feel like a piece of me<br />is dying along with this church.
464306 466849 Well, you're right about that.
472147 475774 ...cocaine smuggling, racketeering<br />and bribing government officials.
475859 478486 He certainly doesn't show it...
478570 481405 but no matter how high his spirits...
481490 483991 they can't hide the fact<br />that America's war on drugs...
484075 486202 has finally taken<br />its first prisoner.
489206 491415 This is Buckwheat.<br />The clubhouse is open.
494711 497296 Here at Dulles, the quiet men<br />from the Justice Department...
497380 500341 wait to hand-cuff the man<br />who has come to symbolize the enemy...
500425 502510 in America's fight against cocaine.
502594 506138 That battle may be almost won,<br />but the war is still in doubt.
506223 509350 Samantha Coleman, WNTW,<br />for Night-Time News.
509434 512394 Roger that, Colonel. Out.
526952 529161 That was the colonel.
529246 531830 Everyone's in position.<br />How's the weather?
531915 534667 We got flurries all along<br />the Virginia coast.
534751 538671 New storm front coming in from the north east.
538755 542466 - God loves the infantry.<br />- Amen.
542551 544969 Carry out your assignments.
548306 550849 15:51. Mark.
550934 552601 Check.
552686 555646 - Later.<br />- Adios, man.
576084 579461 - At 16:30 we'll start.<br />- Hey, it's cold out there, man!
579546 581505 - I stomped my feet for five minutes.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
590432 592850 Two cappuccinos.<br />Make it fast.
613163 615998 - Uh, scotch, straight up, please.<br />- Excuse me, Officers.
616082 619543 This may sound like a wild-goose chase,<br />but I think I just saw -
621129 623797 Saw what?
623882 626550 Elvis. Elvis Presley.
629220 631805 - Fuckin' tourists. Ought to be a law.<br />- Can I get you something else?
631890 634725 Excuse me. There's a large number of you from<br />the Justice Department here this evening.
634809 637144 - Is there any particular reason for that?<br />- Just routine.
637228 639146 - Just routine?<br />- Yes.
639230 641774 - Any comment, sir?<br />- Uh, no. Not right now. Thank you.
641858 644109 Thank you, sir.<br />Thanks.
649032 651450 - Hmm?<br />- Hey, that's Colonel Stuart over there.
651534 653702 Got a little problem with personnel.
653787 655704 Last-minute replacement.
655789 657873 How's the security<br />around this place?
657957 659917 Just like we figured.<br />It's a joke.
660001 662294 Colonel Stuart, could we have<br />a few words, please?
662379 664713 You can have two -<br />"fuck" and "you."
664798 667800 No pictures, you pinko bitch.
668802 671595 Old news.
683942 686110 Oh! Damn it!
687821 690155 Excuse me. Excuse me.
692033 694785 Excuse me.
694869 696954 - What's your hurry?<br />- Thank you.
710093 712010 Hey, man.
714806 717099 - What is it?<br />- You got a key for this door?
717183 719101 Yeah. Why?
719185 721603 'Cause I want you to open it up.<br />That's why.
723231 727484 - Is there a cop on duty around here?<br />- The airport police.
727569 729987 Go get 'em.
754179 757181 Hand me the wrench, will ya?
757265 760058 - Who made you foreman?<br />- Next you're gonna want overtime.
760143 762478 Good idea.
762562 764563 Okay, hold that end.
764647 767649 Watch it, man.
767734 772863 All right. Perfect. Perfect. good to go.
772947 774990 Hey!
775074 778327 It's a restricted area.<br />What's the matter?
778411 780829 - Couldn't wait for the skycap?<br />- We work here.
780914 782915 Let's see some l.D.
782999 786084 - Sure. No problem.<br />- No problem.
787420 789254 Take him!
826751 829586 Ow! Jesus H. Fuck!
875466 878093 What is this, a tag team?
912045 914087 You say he came in here<br />and flashed a badge?
914172 916214 - Yeah. He said to bring you guys back here.<br />- Shit.
943618 945535 Christ.
962220 964346 Fucker!
964430 966223 Freeze!
967684 971395 Nice guess, asshole.<br />I'm a cop. That was the bad guy.
971479 973563 Where's your I.D.?
978403 980404 On its way to Cleveland?
985576 988161 No, you did not<br />explain anything.
988246 990914 All you did was shove me back here<br />into this cattle car.
990999 993667 Sir, you were told<br />when you boarded that we were overbooked.
993751 996044 Fine. Done. I accept that.<br />But why in hell can't I get...
996129 998588 the first-class meal<br />my network paid for?
998673 1001091 - Do you know who I am?<br />- Yes. We've all seen your program.
1001175 1005220 Your episode "Flying Junkyards"<br />was a very objective look at air traffic safety.
1005304 1009349 It wasn't nearly as edifying<br />as "Bimbos of the Sky," was it, Connie?
1009434 1012853 You think you're funny.<br />You think you're funny.
1012937 1016523 Fine.<br />I've got your number.
1016607 1019985 And I've got yours.<br />So park it, sir.
1021279 1023196 Fine.
1032540 1037627 - Stewardess.<br />- Mr. Thornberg, you cannot monopolize my time.
1037712 1040797 - You cannot put me near that woman.<br />- Excuse me?
1042633 1046720 He means he's filed<br />a restraining order against me.
1046804 1048889 I'm not allowed<br />within 50 feet of him.
1048973 1050932 Fifty yards.
1051017 1054561 So by keeping me in this section,<br />you are violating a court order.
1054645 1058190 I can sue you and this airline.
1058274 1060358 That woman assaulted me...
1060443 1063153 and she humiliated me in public.
1069327 1071870 What did you do?
1073331 1075332 Knocked out two of his teeth.
1075416 1078460 Would you like some champagne?
1082256 1084966 Sorry, Officer McClane.<br />I had to check.
1085051 1087469 Here's your piece<br />and shield back.
1087553 1089471 Thanks.
1089555 1093100 Hey, over here, Officer!<br />We understand that there was shooting.
1093184 1097354 ...the presence of Justice Department officials-
1097438 1100482 - Jesus! Oh, Christ!<br />- Hey, come on. Just a word, okay?
1100566 1102943 What the fuck are you people -<br />What are you doing here, man?
1103027 1105862 This is a crime scene.<br />You gotta seal this area off, for Christ's sake.
1105947 1108365 - That's up to the captain.<br />- Oh, it's up to the captain?
1108449 1111660 Maybe you better take me<br />up to the captain then, huh?
1120962 1123296 - Where's Cochrane?<br />- He didn't make it.
1123381 1125340 Oh, man.
1133683 1136226 You're late.
1136310 1138228 We ran into trouble, Colonel.
1138312 1142274 Some cop.<br />He killed Cochrane.
1142358 1144317 I barely got away, sir.
1144402 1146403 Did you accomplish your mission?
1146487 1149406 Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.
1149490 1152951 Well, then the damage is minimal.<br />The penalty could be severe.
1161544 1164796 You fail me again,<br />and the chamber won't be empty.
1165882 1167799 Dismissed.
1171220 1173430 Miss. Miss.<br />I can't find my dog.
1173514 1176433 - Miss. My dog.<br />- One minute, ma'am.
1176517 1178518 I want you to fill out this form.
1181606 1183523 My passport was in it. Yes.
1183608 1186776 Who is it? Come in.
1187820 1189946 - Captain Lorenzo?<br />- Yeah.
1190031 1192782 - I'm John McClane -<br />- Yeah, yeah. I know who you are.
1192867 1195452 You're the asshole<br />that just broke seven F.A.A...
1195536 1197454 and five District<br />of Columbia regulations...
1197538 1200916 running around my airport<br />with a gun, shooting at people.
1201000 1204085 - What do you call that shit?<br />- Self-defense.
1204170 1207839 Well, what, you think that<br />L.A. badge is gonna get you...
1207924 1210383 a free lunch or somethin'<br />around here?
1210468 1213303 No. Maybe a little<br />professional courtesy.
1213387 1215305 In an airport on Christmas week?
1215389 1217974 - You gotta be kiddin'.<br />- Okay. Fuck courtesy.
1218059 1219976 How about just<br />being professional?
1220061 1222312 Your boys just walked away<br />from a crime scene, Captain.
1222396 1225023 You can't wrap this thing<br />up in 10 minutes, and you know it.
1225107 1227359 You gotta seal the area off,<br />take pictures, dust for prints.
1227443 1229361 Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.
1229445 1232489 I know what I'm doing.<br />We're gonna dust it down.
1232573 1234991 We'll take all the pictures.<br />We'll, uh, sweep for fibers.
1235076 1238495 When are you gonna do this? After three<br />or four hundred more people go through there?
1238579 1242624 You'd be lucky to get a print from one of your<br />own people. Just shut down that area and -
1242708 1246336 Oh, just shut the area down?<br />It's that simple, huh? Just shut the area down?
1246420 1250131 Yeah, and I got everybody<br />from the Shriners convention...
1250216 1252968 to the goddamn Boy Scouts<br />traipsing through here!
1253052 1255095 I got lost kids, lost dogs -
1255179 1258640 Not now! Later!<br />I got international diplomats.
1258724 1263103 I got a fuckin' reindeer flying in here<br />from the fuckin' petting zoo!
1263187 1266064 But John McClane -<br />he's got a little problem.
1266148 1268400 Hell, let's shut down<br />the whole fuckin' airport!
1268484 1270986 What do you think they're gonna say upstairs<br />when I tell them that?
1271070 1272988 Why don't you pick up<br />the phone and find out?
1273072 1275782 Because I don't need<br />full fuckin' forensics to tell me...
1275866 1278034 all this was, was some punk<br />stealin' luggage!
1278119 1281538 Luggage? That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.<br />You know what that is?
1281622 1285500 It's a porcelain gun made in Germany.<br />It doesn't show up on your airport x-ray machines...
1285584 1287627 and it costs more than<br />you make in a month.
1287712 1289754 You'd be surprised<br />what I make in a month.
1289839 1292882 - If it's more than $1.98, I'd be very surprised.<br />- Hey, McClane...
1292967 1294968 don't start believin'<br />your own press, huh?
1295052 1298513 Yeah, yeah, I know all about<br />you and that Nakatomi thing in L.A.
1298597 1302183 But just 'cause the TV thinks you're hot shit,<br />that don't make it so.
1302268 1305270 Look, you are<br />in my little pond now...
1305354 1308648 and I am the big fish<br />that runs it.
1308733 1312610 So you capped some lowlife. Fine.
1312695 1316281 I'll send your fuckin' captain<br />in L.A. a fuckin' commendation!
1316365 1318616 In the meantime, you get<br />the hell out of my office...
1318701 1322537 before I have you thrown out<br />of my goddamn airport!
1332757 1335091 Hey, Carmine, let me<br />ask you something.
1335176 1337093 What sets off the metal<br />detectors first?
1337178 1339804 The lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1339889 1341890 Fat fuck.
1351025 1352984 Any I.D. on this guy?
1353069 1355111 That's somebody else's problem. Wait here.
1357406 1360408 - Okay, your car's ready. If you'd<br />just sign right here - - Hi.
1360493 1362786 - Hi.<br />- I need to borrow this and this.
1362870 1364996 - I'll bring it right back.<br />- Hey!
1366082 1367999 Hey! Yo! Hold up!
1369085 1371086 Yo!
1372463 1374381 Hold up, boys.<br />Hold up. Hold up.
1374465 1376383 - We gotta check something.<br />- What are you doing?
1376467 1378426 Pretty gruesome fuckin' job.
1378511 1381971 In all the confusion in there,<br />we forgot to get this clown's prints.
1382056 1383973 Believe that?
1385684 1389437 - Ew! Christ.<br />- Hey, you're supposed to do that at the morgue.
1389522 1393108 Not anymore. Got a new S.O.P.<br />for D.O.A.'s from the F.A.A.
1396028 1399030 I don't think this one's gonna make it, boys.
1399115 1401658 Thanks a lot.
1513103 1515063 Powell here.
1515147 1517690 Take that Twinkie out of your mouth<br />and grab a pencil, will ya?
1517775 1520443 Hey, John. How you doin'?
1520528 1525281 Holly stood me up a day,<br />and I'm here alone in D.C. with my in-laws.
1525366 1527825 Ah, the old in-laws, huh?
1527910 1530537 Man, they do love<br />their policemen son-in-laws, don't they?
1530621 1535500 Listen, Al, what is the fax machine<br />telephone number there at the station?
1535584 1538878 Uh, let's see.
1538963 1540964 555-3212.
1541048 1544509 3212.<br />Hold on a second, all right?
1544593 1547220 I wanna send you something here.<br />Excuse me.
1547304 1550181 You and faxes? This is a first.
1550266 1553560 Yeah, well, Holly told me I should<br />wake up and smell the '90s.
1553644 1556771 - This way?<br />- No. That way.
1556855 1559107 - Wait. It's upside down.<br />- It doesn't matter.
1559191 1561234 Okay. Here it comes.
1563320 1565780 I'm sending you<br />something right now.
1565864 1567865 Hold on a second, cowboy.
1580421 1583214 Fingerprints?
1583299 1585425 Got an unidentified stiff here.
1585509 1588511 I've circled the whorls in pen<br />in case the transmission's a little fuzzy.
1588596 1591598 Listen, run it through state and federal,<br />and if you can, run it through Interpol.
1591682 1594017 Will do.<br />Well, what's this about?
1594101 1596603 Oh, just a feeling I have.
1596687 1600064 Ouch. When you get those feelings,<br />insurance companies start to go bankrupt.
1600149 1602984 Listen, the, uh,<br />fax number is-
1603068 1605528 Is on the top edge<br />of the transmission he just got.
1605613 1608031 Is on the top edge<br />of the transmission you just got.
1610868 1612869 Oh, an airport, huh?
1612953 1615038 Listen, you're not pissing<br />in somebody's pool, are you?
1615122 1618458 Yeah. And I'm fresh out of chlorine.
1625049 1626966 Just as this storm<br />starts breakin'...
1627051 1630553 the satellite feed up<br />and drops the other shoe on us.
1630638 1632555 Look at this new front movin' in.
1632640 1634557 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chickenshit.
1634642 1638811 Well, I can sand down all the runways...
1638896 1640855 and keep the plows going<br />between landings...
1640939 1643566 but you gotta downshift them up there,<br />give me time to work.
1643651 1647153 You got it.<br />All right, everyone.
1647237 1650156 Let's call all our birds<br />and slow 'em down...
1650240 1652617 before we get a parking lot<br />over our heads.
1652701 1654994 The line starts<br />at the Mississippi...
1655079 1657246 and they better start<br />takin' numbers.
1666173 1668091 Can I get you another?
1669301 1672553 No, thank you.
1672638 1675598 I only have to look at his face for another<br />15 or 20 minutes.
1677685 1679644 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />this is the captain speaking.
1679728 1682355 I've just been informed<br />by Dulles Traffic Control...
1682439 1684857 that there's a weather front<br />moving in ahead of us.
1684942 1688569 We may be up here<br />a little while longer.
1688654 1690571 Thank you.
1690656 1692657 On second thought -
1698038 1699872 Al?
1699957 1702041 Hey, I'm right here, partner.
1702126 1704836 Your stiff's dossier is<br />coming through right now.
1706171 1708381 What can you tell me about him?
1708465 1711592 - He's dead.<br />- You needed a computer to figure that one out?
1711677 1714262 No, no, no, no.<br />You don't follow me.
1714346 1717765 According to the Department of Defense,<br />he's been dead for two years.
1717850 1722103 - What?<br />- That's right. "Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.
1722187 1727525 American adviser in Honduras.<br />Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88."
1727609 1730403 Officer?
1730487 1734198 Read between the lines, and I'd say<br />it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff to me.
1734283 1736868 Yeah, I see it.<br />All right, Al. Thanks a lot.
1736952 1739203 - Hey, anytime.<br />- Okay.
1741290 1743207 Say, I close in about an hour.
1743292 1745209 Maybe we can go get a drink?
1748172 1750840 Just the fax, ma'am.<br />Just the fax.
1752718 1754802 Sam, if you're desperate,<br />get some airport personnel...
1754887 1756804 - man-on-the-street stuff.<br />- Hey, wait a second.
1756889 1759015 L see somebody.<br />I'll call you back, okay? Hold on.
1759099 1761684 I'll call you from London. Bye.
1764855 1766773 The Ghost of Christmas Past.
1766857 1769942 Nakatomi? L.A.?<br />You're John McClane, right?
1770027 1772153 - Who are you?<br />- Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
1772237 1774697 - Excuse me.<br />- Hey, come on.
1774782 1776866 Give me a break.<br />I saw the stiff.
1776950 1779368 Word is, that was your handiwork.
1779453 1781996 No. I only do needle-point.
1787169 1790922 Great. National just shut down.<br />Totally iced.
1791006 1794467 - They're gonna be sending us their planes.<br />- Happy, happy holidays.
1794551 1796719 The worst part, Mr. Trudeau, was the press.
1796804 1799055 Oh, they were here anyways,<br />crawlin' all over the Esperanza story...
1799139 1801057 so they got it right<br />on the fuckin' news.
1801141 1803059 You know, bloodstains and all.
1803143 1806521 Personally, I'd like to lock every<br />damn reporter out of the airport...
1806605 1809106 but then they'd just pull<br />that freedom-of-speech crap on us.
1809191 1811108 Then the A.C.L.U.<br />would be all over us.
1811193 1813110 Murder on television.
1813195 1815279 Hell of a start<br />for Christmas week.
1816573 1818991 What is it?<br />A gang thing like last time?
1819076 1821911 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1823330 1825081 - Who the hell is this?<br />- Uh-uh, McClane.
1825165 1828000 - I'm a police officer.<br />- In an unauthorized area.
1828085 1830086 L.A., Mr. Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1830170 1832922 Yeah? That's what I said about<br />my last cholesterol test.
1834258 1836634 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1838095 1840346 I'm sure Captain Lorenzo<br />has explained to you...
1840430 1842807 the minor little fracas<br />with the minor little thieves.
1842891 1845601 Maybe he can explain this.
1863954 1866747 - All systems tapped, Colonel.<br />- Fire it up.
1881972 1884056 "H" minus five minutes.
1884141 1886559 Stand by.
1886643 1890771 All right. We've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1890856 1893399 Assuming it's not a computer error,<br />what do we assume?
1893483 1895818 That somebody's about<br />to seriously fuck with this airport.
1895903 1899572 What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br />I mean, I know we're dummies up here, McClane...
1899656 1901824 so give us a taste<br />of your brilliant genius.
1901909 1904994 - I mean, you're talkin' about a hijacking, a robbery or what?<br />- Look, I'm not sure.
1905078 1909457 Oh, he's not sure.<br />Well, I'm stunned. I gotta lie down.
1909541 1911792 The only people that go to this<br />much trouble are professionals...
1911877 1914211 - not luggage thieves and not punks.<br />- Professional at what?
1914296 1917757 What the fuck do you think this is, huh?<br />The safety patrol here?
1917841 1919842 This is the résumé<br />of a professional mercenary.
1919927 1923721 You got the world's biggest drug dealer on his<br />way here. You need a slide rule to figure this out?
1923805 1926807 Or maybe another body in a zipper bag<br />before you start asking questions?
1926892 1930269 Hey, pal, you're the one that gave us<br />that fuckin' body. Remember that.
1930354 1932855 Yeah, I remember that.
1938862 1941405 Lorenzo, have all your<br />shift commanders report in.
1941490 1944283 - Now.<br />- What? You're not buyin' into this?
1944368 1947954 I want them to report anything out of the<br />ordinary, no matter how trivial. You got that?
1948038 1950247 - Yeah, I got it.<br />- Oh, my God!
1950332 1951582 What?
1951667 1953584 - The runways. Look.<br />- Son of a bitch!
1953669 1956462 - What the hell?<br />- They're shutting down.
1956546 1958589 Jesus Christ.
1963804 1966806 Go to emergency lighting now.
1966890 1969141 Emergency. We are in a code yellow.
1969226 1972269 - Backup systems won't come up.<br />- Shunt to another terminal.
1972354 1975940 - Bobby, what do you got?<br />- Nothing. The whole network is down.
1976024 1977817 Maybe we should call<br />the power company, huh?
1977901 1979735 We're on the same goddamn grid,<br />and we're hot.
1979820 1981988 Dulles, what's going on?<br />I'm on approach.
1982072 1985199 - Maintain position. Repeat.<br />- What's going on down there?
1985283 1987910 - Roger. We're on it.<br />- Western, we're unable right now. Please delay.
1987995 1992540 Fuji 604, execute published<br />missed-approach procedure and hold.
1992624 1995668 T.W.A. 23, unable to clear you<br />for approach at this time.
1995752 1997962 Climb to and maintain<br />one zero thousand.
1998046 2001215 I've checked all systems.<br />It ain't happenin'!
2014104 2016939 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you.<br />The problem's all over the airport. No lights.
2017024 2019692 - What's it look like?<br />- Approach control - it's gone.
2019776 2021777 Jesus. Instrument<br />landing system is down.
2023989 2026198 Confirmed. I.L.S. is dead.
2026283 2029827 Every goddamn system's dead,<br />and NMAC monitors are down.
2035625 2037626 Attention all controllers. Attention.
2037711 2041756 We have a code-red alert.<br />Every aircraft approaching our sector...
2041840 2043924 who are not already<br />in our landing pattern...
2044009 2046177 gets diverted<br />to their alternate airport now.
2046261 2051015 Everyone already on approach<br />or inside our pattern...
2051099 2053476 holds at the outer markers.
2053560 2056854 Stack 'em, pack 'em<br />and rack 'em. Move.
2057856 2060816 Get someone on it!
2063278 2065905 All right. Not a word<br />of this leaves this room.
2065989 2068074 There must be 15,000 people<br />in this airport...
2068158 2070743 and we don't need panic<br />on our hands.
2070827 2072870 We just bought ourselves<br />maybe two hours.
2072954 2076832 After that, those planes low on fuel<br />aren't gonna be circling.
2076917 2079668 They're gonna be droppin'<br />on the White House lawn.
2081379 2084799 McClane, this what you expected?
2084883 2086842 No.
2088386 2090346 This is just the beginning.
2094476 2097603 - F.A.A. hotline.<br />- How could they know already?
2097687 2100773 They can't.
2100857 2104902 - Maybe it's the boys that pulled all your plugs.<br />- Put it on speaker.
2106488 2109365 Attention, Dulles Tower. Attention.
2109449 2112535 They say that blind men become very attentive<br />by way of compensation.
2112619 2114537 Now that you're both<br />blind and deaf...
2114621 2117665 I think I've got your attention.
2117749 2121418 I'm aware your recorders<br />are active, so I'll be quick.
2121503 2123587 You can play me back later<br />to your heart's content.
2123672 2126173 How did you get on this line?<br />Who is this?
2126258 2130219 Who I am is unimportant. What I want -
2131888 2134682 Well, if you don't want those planes to start<br />splashing into the Potomac...
2134766 2137309 as they run out of fuel,<br />what I want is very important.
2137394 2140938 A plane will be landing<br />at this airport in 58 minutes.
2141022 2144316 It is FM-1,<br />Foreign Military One.
2144401 2146193 Now, I'm sure you gentlemen<br />are well aware...
2146278 2148237 - of the unique nature of this flight...<br />- Esperanza?
2148321 2150781 And the importance of its cargo.
2150866 2155161 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2155245 2157830 It will land on a runway<br />of my designation...
2157914 2160749 where it will remain<br />isolated and unapproached.
2160834 2165129 That will conclude my interest<br />in this aircraft and your responsibility for it.
2165213 2170342 At the same time, I want<br />a 747 cargo conversion...
2170427 2173804 fully fueled and placed at my disposal.
2173889 2175806 You have two more minutes<br />to advise...
2175891 2178893 your inbound aircraft<br />to hold at their outer radio marker.
2178977 2181854 After that, you will be<br />able to receive only.
2181938 2186567 Any attempt to restore your systems<br />will be met by severe penalties.
2186651 2190404 - He's bluffing.<br />- Damn it, you can't do this.
2190488 2192573 I am doing this.
2199831 2203167 Okay, you guys, listen up.<br />I need you to punch up a code 15.
2203251 2205169 I got an idea,<br />and I need your help.
2205295 2207671 If Esperanza gets on that plane<br />and makes it to a country...
2207756 2209673 that has no extradition<br />treaties, we're fucked.
2209758 2212927 They're talking to us on our own goddamn system.<br />They gotta be close.
2213011 2215012 I'll have my men tear<br />this airport apart.
2215096 2217014 Just in the nick of time, huh?
2217098 2219975 Hey, McClane, I got a first-class unit here -<br />SWAT team and all.
2220060 2222061 - We don't need any Monday-morning quarterbacks.<br />- Fuck Monday morning.
2222145 2224813 My wife's on one of the goddamn planes<br />these guys are fucking with.
2224898 2228651 That puts me on the playing field. If you'd have<br />moved your fat ass when I told you to...
2228735 2230653 we wouldn't be hip deep<br />in shit right now.
2230737 2232655 - That's it. Security. You're out of here.<br />- Mr. Trudeau -
2232739 2235866 Mr. Trudeau, do I have to remind you<br />about F.A.A. regulations...
2235951 2238535 regarding unauthorized personnel<br />in the control tower?
2238620 2240663 All we have to do is find<br />a way to transmit.
2240747 2243499 Yeah, right. Somebody wanna run down<br />to Radio Shack and get a transmitter?
2243583 2246585 We already have one.<br />The new terminal wing they're building -
2246670 2249546 20 airlines when it's done,<br />all with their own reservation computers...
2249631 2251465 all tied in to a nice<br />big antenna array.
2251549 2254009 - Better see Mr. McClane out.<br />- Get your fuckin' hands off me!
2254094 2256303 - You got no business being up here.<br />- I'm telling you guys.
2256388 2258472 Everything we need<br />is over by the annex skywalk...
2258556 2261475 - just sitting there, waiting to go on line.<br />- The annex skywalk?
2261559 2263894 Goddamn it, Trudeau.<br />You're dealin' with pros here.
2263979 2266522 You can't fuck with these people!<br />Listen to me!
2266606 2269900 Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau,<br />there are a lot of rumors flying around here today.
2269985 2272361 No way. No way, lady.<br />Hell, no. No.
2272445 2274613 This is off limits, Coleman.<br />You know that.
2274698 2276615 Get them out of here.
2276700 2278659 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of too!
2278743 2280661 Get your fucking hands off me.
2280745 2282997 For shit's sake, just get 'em both out of here!
2284374 2287001 Lobby Security, come in.
2287085 2288961 - Tomlinson here.<br />- This is Captain Lorenzo here...
2289045 2291088 with two unauthorized personnel<br />in the fucking tower.
2291172 2293215 Now, would you<br />get your thumb out of your ass...
2293300 2295217 get 'em out of the elevator...
2295302 2297678 or you're gonna find a goddamn pink slip<br />in your Christmas stocking.
2297762 2299763 10-4. Let's go.
2299848 2302474 Goddamn!
2302559 2306562 - Anything who can think of? Can't fuck with what guy?<br />- Shit. Hang on over there.
2306646 2308230 - What for?<br />- Just hang on.
2310317 2313360 Big drug dealer on his way to prison,<br />gunfight at airport...
2313445 2315904 every controller in the coffee shop<br />getting beeped and hauling ass...
2315989 2317906 and you rocking the boat.
2317991 2319950 Connection? Come on, McClane.<br />Just a few words.
2320035 2321952 Okay, just a few words.<br />Fuck off.
2322037 2325247 Thanks, but I already got<br />that from Colonel Stuart.
2326916 2331128 Stuart. The guy that got canned by Congress.<br />That's who he was.
2331212 2333839 - Huh? Who he who? What? Hey!<br />- Shh!
2333923 2337092 It's okay.<br />I've done this before.
2346895 2349104 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2349189 2351273 - Where's the other one?<br />- Claustrophobic, I guess.
2353818 2357112 It's a VHF system, but the planes are so close<br />it doesn't matter.
2357197 2360741 I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,<br />wire in a crossover, and we're hot.
2360825 2362743 Even the planes wouldn't<br />know the difference.
2362827 2365704 Get what you need.<br />Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2365789 2368207 I want my SWAT team<br />to go with him as cover.
2368291 2370918 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of too.
2376341 2379176 Oh, man. I can't<br />fuckin' believe this.
2379260 2381887 Another basement.<br />Another elevator.
2381971 2384807 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?
2406746 2408664 What the fuck?
2443450 2445951 Who are you?
2446035 2449746 I'm Marvin.<br />Marvin. I'm Marvin.
2449831 2452499 I thought you was tryin'<br />to steal my records, that's all.
2453543 2456378 I'm just the janitor.
2462010 2466180 This is Dulles Approach<br />to all aircraft holding at Potomac VORTAC.
2466264 2469099 We are experiencing<br />some technical problems here.
2469184 2471143 The weather conditions,<br />which have been deteriorating all day...
2471227 2475731 have now been complicated by, uh -<br />by an unforeseen human factor.
2475815 2479526 This has affected all<br />of our electronic equipment...
2479611 2481695 and their redundant backups<br />as well.
2481779 2485491 As a result, our nav<br />and approach systems are down...
2485575 2488076 and we expect to lose voice<br />in another minute.
2488161 2492414 We want you to continue<br />holding at the outer marker as directed...
2492499 2494500 and wait for further instructions.
2494584 2496627 As soon as we're back on line...
2496711 2499922 we'll expedite your landings<br />on a fuel-emergency basis.
2501633 2503634 Good luck.
2505011 2506970 God bless.
2512644 2515604 All right.<br />Change the boards.
2542048 2543966 Okay, stand back.
2544050 2546635 - The skywalk annex.<br />- No, goddamn it. The annex skywalk.
2546719 2550097 Listen to me. The annex skywalk. It's the last<br />thing I heard before they kicked me out.
2550181 2552224 Well, let me see here now.
2552308 2554309 Well, this must be it<br />right there.
2554394 2559147 See? That's the raised platform,<br />and there's the new terminal.
2559232 2562109 There's your skywalk.
2562193 2564152 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2565697 2568782 What's the fastest way you can<br />get me out to that spot?
2572287 2574705 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2574789 2576873 Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.<br />We'll watch your back.
2576958 2578875 Yeah? Who watches yours?
2590847 2595392 Main ventilation duct.<br />Main ventilation duct.
2595476 2597394 And bingo.
2597478 2602357 Just once,<br />I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.
2603818 2608322 Eggnog, a fuckin'<br />Christmas tree...
2608406 2611783 a little turkey.
2611868 2616079 But no, I gotta crawl around in<br />this motherfucking tin can.
2621419 2623670 We're in the annex skywalk.<br />I can see the array.
2623755 2626757 I'll give you a call for a protocol test<br />as soon as it's hot.
2626841 2630594 That's all for now. Sergeant, we may<br />need some more equipment.
2630678 2634514 - I'd like to send one of your guys back for it.<br />- Right, sir. You got it.
2636768 2639519 What the hell's goin' on?
2639604 2641730 Hey! Put that back on!
2643274 2646526 Hey, asshole,<br />what do I look like to you?
2646611 2649029 A sitting duck.
2649947 2651865 Take him!
2653493 2656662 Shit!
2656746 2659414 Damn it.<br />I hate it when I'm right.
2663544 2665545 Look out!<br />Get down!
2673554 2675889 Keep your head down!
2685441 2688235 You son of a bitch!
2765271 2768023 Stay down!
2780703 2782662 Fuck!
2782747 2785165 Motherfucker!
2791172 2793423 Come on.<br />Come on.
2813444 2816196 Fucking son of a bitch!
2832755 2836132 Shit.
2839220 2841429 Fuck.
2844517 2847561 I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.
2880720 2883805 - Geez.<br />- You all right?
2883890 2887809 Yeah. Yeah. But the antenna array -<br />I gotta get to it and set it up.
2892732 2894983 Get down!
2912293 2915462 Goddamn.
2917381 2920008 Bait.
2920927 2923887 Jerk us off...
2923971 2926181 make Lorenzo sacrifice<br />his best men.
2930436 2932479 Make you waste your time -
2935483 2937400 time we don't have.
2951874 2954501 I think you're closer<br />than 50 yards.
2954585 2957504 So's that airplane.<br />Practically.
2957588 2959965 Yeah. There's quite a few of them out there.
2960049 2961967 It looks like<br />a regular traffic jam.
2962051 2964094 There's nothing<br />regular about it.
2964178 2968431 See? You're intrigued.<br />That's my gift, Mrs. McClane.
2968516 2971351 I notice things -<br />things other people wouldn't see.
2971435 2974312 That's how I make<br />people curious.
2974397 2976231 Don't you mean nauseous?
2976315 2980777 Look. The people have a right to know<br />everything about everybody.
2980861 2982821 You got in the way of that.
2982905 2985740 Listen, buster, you<br />endangered my children...
2985825 2989369 and you didn't do it<br />for anything as noble as the people.
2989453 2991371 The only time you even<br />see the people...
2991455 2994249 is when you look down<br />to see what it is you're stepping on.
2998963 3001047 Me? Yeah, I'll live...
3001132 3003341 but Lorenzo's SWAT team<br />is dead...
3003426 3005343 and the antenna array is-is gone.
3005428 3009431 Didn't you see it?
3009515 3011766 I'm tired of looking for a new miracle.
3013686 3015729 Just hold a minute.<br />No, I'll be right back.
3015813 3019024 Just hold for a second.<br />Something's going on here.
3019108 3020900 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Just hold on for a minute.
3020985 3024154 I say again, Annex Team,<br />give us a sit rep.
3025781 3027991 Annex Team, come in.<br />Do you copy?
3029535 3033580 It's got some kind of scramble on it.<br />Can you do anything with it?
3033664 3038835 No. This scramble mode must<br />activate on this code panel.
3038919 3042005 Even if we scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in.
3042089 3044090 - These guys are pros.<br />- So are you. Break the code.
3044175 3046468 I wanna hear what these bastards<br />are sayin' to each other.
3046552 3049054 This is a 10-digit control panel,<br />six-digit readout.
3049138 3051723 Hell, that could be<br />a million combinations.
3051807 3054309 Next time you kill<br />one of these guys...
3054393 3057020 - get him to enter the code first.<br />- Yeah.
3058981 3061649 Sir, we just monitored a call<br />from their chief engineer.
3061734 3064319 Our people took out<br />their SWAT team completely.
3064403 3067322 You were right. They went for the antenna array.<br />We're right on schedule.
3067406 3070366 Losing our own team<br />wasn't part of the plan.
3075956 3077874 Attention, Dulles Tower.
3077958 3081127 Attention, Dulles Control Tower.
3081212 3084672 Mr. Trudeau, I know you're listening.<br />Unfortunately, you're not obeying.
3084757 3086674 Try me face-to-face, and we'll see.
3086759 3088676 You were warned not to try<br />to restore your systems.
3088761 3092555 You've wasted lives and precious time<br />on a futile and obvious target.
3092640 3095391 Now you're gonna<br />pay the penalty.
3095476 3099521 L got five dead officers down here,<br />Colonel Stuart. Isn't that penalty enough?
3099605 3102357 McClane, you keep out of this.<br />You've been nothing but a pain -
3104276 3108154 Oh, McClane.<br />John McClane.
3108239 3113493 The policeman hero who saved<br />the Nakatomi hostages.
3113577 3115495 I read about you<br />in People magazine.
3115579 3117747 You seemed out of your league<br />on Nightline, I thought.
3117832 3119749 Hey, Colonel, blow me.
3119834 3123211 How much drug money<br />is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
3123295 3127173 I think Cardinal Richelieu said it best.<br />"Treason is merely a matter of dates."
3127258 3131302 This country's got to learn<br />that it can't keep cutting the legs off...
3131387 3133388 of men like General Esperanza...
3133472 3137350 men who have the guts to stand up<br />against communist aggression.
3138477 3140478 And lesson one starts<br />with killing policemen?
3140563 3144482 What's lesson two -<br />the neutron bomb?
3144567 3147193 No. I think we can find<br />something in between.
3149822 3152115 Watch this.
3152199 3156452 Give me a flight number,<br />one that's low on fuel.
3156537 3158663 Windsor 114.<br />Transatlantic from London.
3158747 3161749 Fuel tank's dry as a martini.
3161834 3165920 Activate the I.L.S. landing system,<br />but recalibrate sea level...
3167590 3169632 minus 200 feet.
3193657 3195575 Oh, Jesus!
3195659 3198536 They've reset<br />ground level minus 200 feet.
3198621 3203333 Windsor Flight 114.<br />This is Dulles Approach. Do you copy?
3203417 3207545 Dulles Approach, this is Windsor 114.<br />Where the devil have you been?
3207630 3212217 Windsor 114. Dulles Approach.<br />We've been right here all along, old buddy.
3212301 3214802 Our systems only came back<br />on line just this very second.
3214887 3217388 Windsor 114...
3217473 3221643 you are cleared for I.L.S. approach,<br />runway two-niner.
3221727 3223686 Contact Dulles Tower frequency<br />at the outer marker.
3223771 3226064 Jesus Christ!<br />He's gonna crash the fuckin' plane!
3226148 3230860 Roger, Approach, and about time. I've got<br />230 people up here flying on petrol fumes.
3230945 3235031 - Roger, 114. Understand. Calibrate Dulles altimeter...<br />- Oh, Jesus.
3235115 3238660 - They'll fly right into the concrete.<br />- Son of a bitch!
3238744 3242205 - Why are they listening to him?<br />- It's our frequency! Why shouldn't they?
3242289 3245416 - Dulles, this is Windsor 114.<br />- Barnes!
3245501 3249087 This is Dulles Tower.<br />We have radar contact.
3249171 3251172 Give me your coat!
3252258 3254175 What are you gonna do?
3254260 3256678 Whatever I can.
3258722 3260932 Ladies and gentlemen...
3261016 3263059 as you've probably noticed,<br />we've started our descent.
3263143 3265061 We're sorry<br />for the inconvenience...
3265145 3267605 but we'll all be on the<br />ground in a few minutes.
3267690 3270608 - Thank you.<br />- Please keep your seat belts on.
3270693 3273111 Oh, not to worry. We've made arrangements<br />for your next flight...
3273195 3275405 - so you won't miss it, okay?<br />- Thank you.
3275489 3279534 In your seat, please.<br />Come on. In your seat.
3279618 3282620 Oh, hey.<br />We're just like British Rail, love.
3282705 3286040 We may be late, but we get you there.<br />Don't worry.
3302808 3304809 Good luck, McClane!
3327207 3331461 Dulles, this is Windsor 114,<br />inside the outer marker.
3331545 3334380 Roger, 114.<br />This is Dulles Tower.
3334465 3336924 We have radar contact<br />and show you on I.L.S.
3337009 3339260 You're in the glide path,<br />and you're looking good.
3348562 3350563 There's somebody out there!
3354568 3358112 It's McClane. Christ.
3361825 3365536 - Approach flaps.<br />- Approach flaps.
3365621 3368164 Approach speed, 140.
3368248 3370291 - Approach speed, 140.<br />- 130.
3370376 3373711 130.<br />Altitude 1,000 feet.
3373796 3375880 800, guys!<br />You're only at 800 feet!
3375964 3379258 Fire and Rescue, this is Cummings.<br />Roll everything out to runway two-niner!
3379343 3383888 Ref-speed plus 20. 600 feet.
3385099 3388017 Looking good, Windsor.<br />Now watch it.
3388102 3391020 30-knot crosswinds,<br />and the runway is icy.
3391105 3393022 Attaboy. We've got you.
3394316 3398361 We've got you.
3407037 3410123 No! Pull up!
3411208 3413167 Jesus!
3425764 3429183 - We're gonna die!<br />- We've got you.
3453083 3455626 No.
3455711 3457712 God.
3462176 3468973 Motherfucker.
3471643 3473561 Oh, Jesus.
3485324 3488159 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3488243 3491204 If the 747 we requested<br />is ready on time...
3491288 3494040 and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested...
3494124 3496626 further lessons can be avoided.
3496710 3498628 Out.
3498712 3501756 God.
3522277 3524362 Come on, you guys!
3530077 3531994 Hurry! Hurry!
3532079 3534205 We need a truck over there!
3544383 3548135 We got no sign of survivors down here!<br />It's a goddamn nightmare!
3549680 3552348 Hey, Nelson!
3562317 3564652 Barnes!
3564736 3568614 We've gotta warn those planes there's a lunatic<br />down here who likes to pretend he's the tower.
3568699 3571200 - Get up to the cabin. Get me on the air.<br />- How?
3571285 3574161 - You figure it out!<br />- Here's the manifest.
3595183 3597602 McClane, I know<br />how you must feel.
3602107 3605192 L wanted to help<br />those people tonight.
3606570 3609864 I was pretty goddamn useless.
3612576 3614994 We called<br />the government for help.
3615078 3618914 They're gonna send in<br />a special army unit...
3618999 3621208 a counterterrorist team.
3628050 3632345 Your wife's plane?<br />Well, they're still broadcasting...
3632429 3635723 even though we can't answer.
3636933 3639894 They're gonna<br />run out of fuel in 90 minutes.
3651573 3655826 Listen, Dick.<br />That is your name - Dick.
3655911 3658871 If you're going to continue<br />to get this close...
3658955 3662500 do you think you might consider<br />switching aftershaves?
3662584 3664794 Anything else?
3664878 3667922 Stronger mouthwash<br />might be nice.
3668006 3670508 And here's Sam Coleman<br />reporting live from the site-
3670592 3672551 Well, Colonel...
3672636 3675513 they've done everything<br />we've anticipated... so far.
3675597 3678432 But still there has been<br />no official word from authorities.
3678517 3682937 Meanwhile, despite the fact that only one<br />runway has been closed due to the tragedy...
3683021 3687316 several dozen airliners are visible from where<br />I stand, endlessly circling the field.
3687401 3689944 Other reports say that<br />there was trouble in the tower...
3690028 3693322 before the crash and that that<br />may have even contributed to it.
3693407 3695991 One thing is certain -<br />With weather conditions worsening...
3696076 3699495 the problem here and in the sky above us<br />will continue to grow.
3699579 3702915 I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles<br />International Airport.
3710006 3712842 - Victor. Victor. Victor.<br />- Yeah, what's up?
3712926 3714844 Did you pack the radio<br />mikes from the shoot...
3714928 3717388 - or did you put them in your carry-on?<br />- Are you crazy?
3717472 3720015 - I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em in.<br />- I love you.
3720100 3722643 Give me one of the receivers.
3726106 3731026 - Can you tune in to the cockpit frequency?<br />- Yeah. Why?
3731111 3733112 I wanna hear what's goin' on.
3734906 3737324 Should be right here on our band.
3737409 3741412 - Nothing.<br />- You just told me it would work. Is it working or not?
3741496 3746041 It is working, but it's-<br />All I'm getting is some kind of airport beacon.
3746126 3749920 It's weird. It's like<br />the tower isn't there.
3752132 3754425 Stay on it.
3754509 3756552 Let me know when<br />there is something there.
3756636 3758846 Okay.
3796176 3799011 - Major Grant. We're Blue Light.<br />- Rollins, Department of Justice.
3799095 3801013 Trudeau, chief of air operations.
3801097 3803349 Lorenzo, terminal police.
3803433 3805351 You want something, you got it.
3805435 3808479 This is it?<br />One fucking platoon?
3808563 3812107 - One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?<br />- John McClane.
3812192 3816070 - McClane, you showed some balls out there, man.<br />- Yeah.
3816154 3820241 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3820325 3822868 Well, it looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3822953 3824870 Isn't Colonel Stuart<br />one of your men?
3824955 3828707 No, not anymore he's not.<br />Now we're here to take Colonel Stuart down.
3828792 3831043 And we will take him down.
3831127 3834338 You see, I served with him.<br />I taught him everything he knows.
3834422 3838217 Well, maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3838301 3840719 Let's hustle!
3840804 3844014 Command post will be set up<br />in the airport police station.
3844099 3847017 I want to be tied in to the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3847102 3849103 All right, let's do it!
3850230 3852231 Hey, Trudeau.
3854526 3856527 Things just get better or worse?
3860532 3862449 Lights-big, portable lights.
3862534 3866245 - We set up the field, and then -<br />- We wait for those lunatics to shoot 'em out?
3866329 3868956 And where do we get those big, portable lights-<br />borrow them from Batman?
3869040 3870958 What about the air phone idea?
3871042 3873878 There's 18 planes up there.<br />Only five of them have those phones.
3873962 3876338 We got through to three.<br />We're still trying on the others.
3876423 3879174 That leaves 13 accidents waiting to happen.<br />Are they still bucking headwinds?
3879259 3882344 I just checked the weather. Headwinds are<br />slamming everybody over the outer marker.
3882429 3884638 The planes with enough fuel<br />have already been...
3884723 3886307 shunted to Atlanta,<br />Memphis and Nashville.
3886474 3888934 Outer marker.
3889019 3892855 Damn!<br />The outer marker!
3892939 3895357 It's a beacon, right?<br />A radio beacon that sends out...
3895442 3897693 this "beep, beep, beep"<br />so they know they're over it, right?
3897777 3901155 - So?<br />- So who says that radio signal has to just beep?
3901239 3904992 Right. We switch the frequency<br />from the tower over to the one in the beacon.
3905076 3907828 - We pump up the wattage.<br />- And we can talk to our planes...
3907913 3909997 and those bastards<br />who did this will never know!
3912542 3915544 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3915629 3918297 They've been tapped<br />into your tower chatter all night.
3918381 3920424 Punks stealin' luggage,<br />huh, Carmine?
3924054 3926472 - How you doing, Telford?<br />- No good.
3926556 3928974 I called Langley.<br />They're rigging a portable decoder.
3929059 3931977 - It'll be here in two hours.<br />- My wife doesn't have two hours.
3932062 3934480 I was only transferred<br />to Grant's team yesterday.
3934564 3936482 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3936566 3940819 - Word is, nobody's better at this than Major Grant.<br />- Attention!
3940904 3943530 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3943615 3946784 I want to hear about the plane<br />those bastards asked for.
3946868 3949995 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.<br />Pilots' briefing room. Now.
3950080 3951997 - Keep working.<br />- Albertson!
3952082 3954083 - Sir!<br />- With me.
3954167 3956168 Yes, sir!
3958797 3960881 No civilians.
3971476 3973394 What the fuck?
3973478 3975521 What is it?
3975605 3977523 The outer marker beeper.
3977607 3980234 It isn't beeping.<br />It's talking.
3980318 3982987 Attention all aircraft in Dulles landing pattern.
3983071 3985155 This is Chief Engineer<br />Leslie Barnes.
3985240 3987992 I have been authorized<br />to brief you in full.
3988076 3992496 At this time, this is the only<br />channel available to us.
3992580 3994999 Here is the situation.
3995083 3997334 Approximately two hours ago -
3999629 4001547 Wait till you get a load of this.
4001631 4004341 Do not accept any instructions<br />claiming to be from our tower...
4004426 4007678 unless you hear your own<br />flight recorder access code.
4007762 4010848 - The terrorists have got all our systems...<br />- Holy shit! Get this on tape.
4010932 4012850 And now have control of everything<br />except this channel.
4012934 4014893 Give us a second here, please.
4014978 4017521 This channel is secure,<br />but your own transmissions are not.
4017605 4019523 Do not, repeat...
4019607 4023694 do not attempt to reply on your own<br />frequencies to this broadcast.
4023778 4025863 These people have already<br />caused one crash...
4025947 4028115 - by impersonating our tower.<br />- Jesus.
4039127 4041128 Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...
4041212 4043964 the two systems that can<br />allow you to land -
4044049 4045966 field lights for a visual landing...
4046051 4047968 and the I.L.S. for an instrument.
4048053 4049970 A special U.S. Army unit<br />is already here...
4050055 4052347 and preparing to take out<br />the terrorists.
4052432 4054767 - My God.<br />- Don't accept any instructions -
4054851 4057478 - Yo, Marvin.<br />- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?
4057562 4060064 No. It never looked<br />good on me anyway. Come here.
4060148 4063317 Listen, you gotta get me up to the pilots'<br />briefing room. They're havin' a little soiree.
4063401 4066779 I gotta hear what they're sayin'<br />even if I gotta put a fuckin' glass to the door.
4066863 4069490 - Which one of these maps gets me in there?<br />- Don't touch it!
4069574 4072868 - Find the map, Marvin.<br />- I'll find it. You'll mess up my whole damn filing system here.
4072952 4075829 Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.<br />I think that's in the main terminal.
4075914 4079708 So would that be under<br />"P" for "pilots' briefing room"?
4079793 4083754 - Now, Marvin.<br />- Or maybe it would be under "M" for "miscellaneous."
4088426 4091178 - Oh, shit!<br />- This is Garber. Request permission to reduce...
4091346 4092888 sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.
4092972 4095140 My men are getting cold.<br />They're getting antsy. Over.
4095225 4098936 This is Colonel Stuart. Garber, please have the<br />men not on watch assemble for a briefing. Over.
4099020 4101188 Roger, Colonel. Over and out.
4101272 4103941 What's the matter?
4104025 4109404 Gentlemen, tonight<br />the pattern ends.
4109489 4113200 The dominoes will fall no more,<br />and the ramparts will remain upright.
4113284 4116703 - Sir, General Esperanza's plane<br />just came on the scope.
4123253 4125254 - Tracking.<br />- Attention, Dulles Tower.
4125338 4127589 We will be lighting up a runway.
4127674 4131218 Do not, repeat, do not<br />attempt to land any planes.
4131302 4134221 Remember, we're monitoring you.
4137100 4140811 - What do we do?<br />- Obey.
4146943 4149528 Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.
4149612 4152406 Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.
4152490 4155784 This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.<br />We read you. Over.
4155869 4161748 Foxtrot Michael One, you are to come in<br />on runway 1-5, repeat, 1-5.
4175638 4179683 I found it on the floor, by the coat,<br />next to the luggage belt.
4179767 4181685 What the hell you so excited<br />about that for?
4181769 4183729 The code's still punched<br />into this one.
4183813 4187399 You like it, huh?<br />How about you give me 20 bucks for it?
4187483 4189735 How about I let you live?
4191279 4193405 Man knows how to bargain.
4193531 4195866 This is contrary to our instructions.
4195950 4198785 We are to land at runway 1-0...
4198870 4202706 where we are to be met<br />by representatives of your Justice De -
4202790 4207252 Captain, please tell the tower<br />you will proceed as ordered.
4218223 4220474 Roger, Dulles.
4220558 4223185 Proceeding to runway 1-5.
4239077 4241161 Foxtrot Michael One,<br />come in, please.
4242789 4244706 What are you going to do now?
4244791 4247125 You going to shoot me?<br />So who will fly the plane?
4247210 4250504 Don't worry about it.<br />It's not your problem.
4257136 4258679 Michael One, do you copy?
4262642 4265102 Foxtrot Michael One,<br />come in, please.
4274404 4277197 Eagle Nest.<br />This is Falcon. Mayday.
4277282 4280242 Eagle Nest. This is Falcon.<br />Mayday!
4282036 4286915 - Go ahead, Falcon.<br />- I've lost cabin pressure. Near zero visibility.
4287000 4289876 I must drop out of this<br />weather and land now...
4289961 4291878 on the first accessible runway.
4291963 4296258 Repeat. I've lost cabin pressure.<br />Near zero visibility.
4296342 4298302 I must drop out of the storm.
4298386 4300637 I can land, but I must land now...
4300722 4302848 on the first outgoing runway.
4302932 4307269 Repeat. I cannot circle<br />around to runway 1-5.
4310231 4312149 I'll make you a deal, Marvin.
4312233 4314151 You show me a shortcut<br />out to those runways...
4314235 4316153 and I'll get you<br />a liner for that coat.
4316237 4319448 Repeat. I cannot circle around<br />to runway 1-5.
4319532 4321742 Shit.<br />Stand by, Falcon.
4323745 4326455 Here, sir. He's coming in<br />from the ocean, sir.
4328750 4331168 A bullet has damaged my instruments.
4331252 4333170 I'm not sure of my bearing...
4333254 4335630 and I must make<br />a visual landing immediately.
4335715 4338550 - Do you copy, Eagle Nest?<br />- Roger, Falcon.
4338634 4342679 - That would be 2-5 right, repeat, 2-5 right.<br />- What?
4342764 4346016 Make up your fucking mind!
4346100 4349061 Oh, we are just up to our ass<br />in terrorists again, John.
4349145 4352105 - 2-5 left.<br />- Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.
4352190 4354566 2-5 right.
4354650 4356943 I gotta quit smoking cigarettes.
4357028 4359237 Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.
4359322 4363283 But if you could show it to me as well,<br />I would be grateful.
4374003 4376296 I see the lights.
4376381 4379216 They are directly in front of me.<br />Gracias, compadre.
4379300 4382219 Reducing airspeed.<br />Approaching runway.
4382303 4385347 - Wish me luck.<br />- Roger, Falcon.
4386474 4388934 We copy. We'll have you<br />in five minutes.
4389018 4392145 That's right, asshole.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4415795 4419381 I see your lights. E.T.A. 90 seconds.
4428307 4430851 Come to papa, scumbag.
4486073 4488658 Oh, shit!
4546759 4548760 Freedom.
4550513 4553640 Not yet.
4553724 4557060 You're supposed to stay in your seat<br />until the plane reaches the terminal.
4557144 4559437 No frequent-flier mileage for you.
4559522 4561815 - Who are you?<br />- A cop.
4561899 4565235 - A cop?<br />- Yeah, one of the good guys. You're one of the bad guys.
4565319 4568446 And now that I got your sorry ass,<br />I'm gonna trade it for my wife.
4577832 4580166 Sit down!
4582336 4584212 - I'm goin' in!<br />- I got you covered.
4590052 4591845 - Where'd he go?<br />- In there.
4601147 4604691 I don't believe this.<br />Two months of planning...
4604775 4607110 and you can't anticipate one<br />pendejo nfa cop.
4607194 4609237 - Come on, General.<br />- Where the hell is Colonel Stuart?
4613284 4615493 - General!<br />- I am all right.
4615578 4617621 He said he was a policeman.
4617705 4619623 I thought you had this place secured.
4619707 4621708 He went in the cockpit.
4621792 4625003 He's goin' to hell!<br />McClane!
4626464 4628715 I assume it's you, McClane.
4628799 4631676 You're quite a little soldier.
4631761 4635430 You can consider this<br />a military funeral!
4658454 4660789 How many grenades we got?
4660873 4664209 - Three each!<br />- Use 'em!
4673969 4677097 Oh, fuck.
4677181 4679891 Oh! Sh -
4690569 4693154 Go!
4708337 4710338 Oh, shit!
4719223 4721182 You lucky fuck.
4724562 4728815 - Fire trucks, sir.<br />- Fall back to the church. Now!
4750796 4752839 Where's the fucking door?
4766729 4770064 They're getting a little nervous<br />back there. In fact, so am I.
4770149 4772066 We're right over Washington.
4772151 4774569 See if you can get any TV.<br />That'll settle 'em down.
4774653 4777530 Works for me. I'll -
4800721 4804140 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the Video Sleaze Awards?
4804225 4807185 - Try Pulitzer.<br />- Ladies and gentlemen...
4807269 4811064 while waiting to land, our cabin attendants<br />are turning on local Washington broadcasting.
4811148 4813066 The sound is on channel three.
4819740 4822408 Okay. Okay. Okay.
4829917 4833586 Please, sir, we may land at any moment.
4833671 4835588 - If you'll take your seat -<br />- I'm gonna be sick.
4835673 4837590 Excuse me. I'm gonna be sick.
4837675 4839759 Sir, the seat belt light is on.
4843722 4845098 Moron.
4845182 4847100 - WZDC.<br />- Yes, this is Richard Thornberg.
4847184 4849102 Put me through to Ruben in the newsroom.
4849186 4851688 - He's about to go live.<br />- I know he's about to go on.
4851772 4854190 - That's why I need him.<br />- You'll have to hold on -
4854275 4857443 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your résumé.
4857528 4860113 Esperanza's down.
4860197 4864033 But he's hurt.<br />He took a round in his shoulder.
4864118 4866035 Plus I got one more of their guys.
4866120 4868037 That's six they lost altogether.
4868122 4871082 Maybe if we knew how many<br />they had to start with, we could get excited...
4871166 4874878 but if they got 50 guys,<br />it's a little early to break out the champagne!
4874962 4878923 We appreciate your effort, McClane, but we<br />don't need a loose cannon on this deck!
4879008 4882176 What if they decide to crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your little stunt?
4882261 4884679 They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?
4884763 4887557 Besides, if I grabbed<br />Esperanza, this would all be over by now.
4887641 4890310 Well, maybe they're just<br />a little bit more creative than you think!
4890394 4892645 Well, at least<br />I'm thinking, goddamn it!
4892730 4895231 Listen, you wise-ass, we're here to jerk off<br />that cocksucker...
4895316 4897442 until he tries to take off - period!
4897526 4900653 Now, you're the wrong guy<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time!
4902239 4905658 The story of my life.
4905743 4909203 Major, Pentagon<br />Situation Room, sir!
4909288 4912415 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.<br />Thank you, Telford.
4912499 4915335 You men come with me.
4916754 4918671 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4918756 4922216 - You said those guys showed up out there right away?<br />- Yeah.
4922301 4924719 So - So that must mean<br />they're on the field or close.
4924803 4927221 And I think I know where.
4927306 4929307 Come here. Let me<br />show you something.
4931685 4935688 These are the old plans when the longer<br />runways went in. That's-That's 12 years ago.
4935773 4938858 Looks like they've done<br />some modifications on-site -
4938943 4942236 moved TRACON phones, I.L.S.,<br />all the underground stuff...
4942321 4944238 so they could handle drainage.
4944323 4947742 If I'm right, all of it would run right<br />along the airport property...
4947826 4951037 and go right past<br />this neighborhood.
4953749 4955792 We should have been<br />on the ground two hours ago!
4955876 4957794 I understand,<br />but if you just relax a little -
4957878 4961422 - Come on, lady. Who you tryin' to kid?<br />- It's hopeless.
4961507 4965051 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess. That's for sure.
4965135 4968763 Well, unfortunately, there really isn't anyone<br />we can blame for the weather.
4968847 4971766 Oh, yeah? What about<br />that porker Willard Scott?
4971850 4973768 I should have taken the bus.
4973852 4976980 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4977064 4979941 - Excuse me.<br />- Yes?
4980025 4981943 I was just wondering.
4982027 4986322 Um, this flight originally was supposed to be<br />five and a half hours, right?
4986407 4990118 - Mm-hmm.<br />- Do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this?
4990202 4994247 Oh, of course.<br />They anticipate little problems like this.
5011849 5014434 Barnes, we looked at 12 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
5014518 5017353 This is our last possibility.
5017438 5019522 Over here there's an old church.
5019606 5021274 Let's go.
5025863 5027864 Wait.
5034246 5036372 There's the church over there.
5043881 5047759 - Could be a sentry.<br />- And he could just be out for a walk.
5047843 5050303 Then why is he going over<br />his own footsteps?
5052890 5055141 Come on.
5056810 5060146 All right. Just stay here and get<br />ready to call the marines.
5060230 5064567 - I thought they were the army.<br />- Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
5080584 5082919 Oh, shit.
5083003 5085129 Not now.
5099311 5101354 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5101438 5103481 Barnes, where the hell did you go?<br />Where's McClane?
5103565 5107026 He's with me. We're at the Highland Lake<br />Community Church on the west side of the airport.
5107111 5110279 You're where? Goddamn it!<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't -
5110364 5113950 This must be their base of operations.<br />Shut up and get your ass over here! Move it!
5114034 5116119 Code red! Sit rep.
5116203 5119163 We got positive I.D.<br />on Stuart's location. Let's move.
5119248 5121249 - Yo!<br />- Yes, sir.
5131552 5134178 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
5136306 5138558 If there are no more surprises.
5153240 5155741 Gentlemen, we have a situation here.
5232903 5235154 Over here.
5247501 5250253 Geez, McClane, you all right?<br />You want a medic?
5250337 5253506 McClane, what the hell you think<br />you're doing out there, playing John Wayne?
5253590 5255841 How would you like<br />to spend the night in a cell?
5255926 5259428 Lorenzo, shut the fuck up and do something<br />useful. Go seal off the street.
5259513 5261597 Hey, you can't<br />talk to me like that.
5261682 5266811 Oh, no, Carmine? Sergeant, get this<br />bureaucrat out of Mr. McClane's face now.
5266895 5268813 With pleasure, sir.
5270524 5274277 Major, the men are in position, sir.
5274361 5276445 Close up the back.<br />Then we go in.
5276530 5278906 - Fire only on my order.<br />- Roger that, sir.
5278991 5280908 Guess I was wrong about you.
5280993 5283494 You're not such<br />an asshole after all.
5283578 5287164 No, you were right.<br />I'm just your kind of asshole.
5295507 5298217 Garber, sit rep!
5298302 5302179 Army Special Forces on three sides,<br />closing in fast around the back!
5302264 5305683 - Another problem, Colonel?<br />- No problem, General.
5305767 5308769 Gentlemen, you know what to do.
5319531 5321866 - Down!<br />- Get down! Get down!
5349770 5353522 General, it's time.
5359780 5362782 Come on. Let's move it!
5376838 5378923 - They're pulling out!<br />- What?
5379007 5381008 Out the back!
5387933 5389934 Move it!
5399277 5401779 Albertson, take your men<br />around the back.
5427264 5429932 This equipment -<br />it could land our planes.
5430016 5432726 Don't touch anything. There were trip wires<br />outside. They could have booby-trapped -
5432811 5436480 - They did.<br />- Got one here. Looks like C-4. The motherfucker is armed.
5436565 5439859 Clear the area!<br />Everybody, now!
5442446 5444363 They booby-trapped<br />all the equipment.
5444448 5446365 - Seal off the building!<br />- Shit!
5446450 5449368 Secure the area.<br />Post sentries. No civilians allowed.
5449453 5452913 Hey, where the fuck is McClane?
5501755 5504590 Miller, take him!
5504674 5507801 I'll cover you!
5530283 5532451 Goddamn!
5553473 5558394 So much for the element of chance.<br />Let's move out.
5575912 5577913 I had the bastard in my sights.
5577998 5579999 I know I did.
5588341 5591552 Oh. Oh, Jesus Christ.
5596683 5599268 Attention, Tower. Attention, Dulles Tower.
5599352 5601895 This is Colonel Stuart.<br />Is our plane prepared?
5601980 5603897 It is.<br />It's in Hangar 11.
5603982 5606233 It's the most<br />remote building we've got.
5607444 5609361 We're on our way.
5609446 5612906 Have a ground crew there<br />to confirm the condition of the plane.
5612991 5615909 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5615994 5619747 Colonel, you're quite capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5619831 5622833 Now, please, don't ask us<br />to gift wrap potential hostages for you.
5622917 5624835 Major Grant, isn't it?
5624919 5628756 If you remember me, Colonel, then you<br />remember I know the drill as well as you do.
5629924 5631967 Check out<br />your own fucking plane.
5632052 5636388 We move out in five minutes.<br />Flak-jackets for everybody.
5636473 5638474 Body armor for the assault team.
5638558 5641226 Night scopes for the snipers.
5641311 5643937 We will take them in the hangar,<br />and I will pull that detonator...
5644022 5647566 out of Stuart's dead<br />fucking hand myself.
5647651 5650444 - Lorenzo, take all your men back to the airport.<br />- Sir.
5650528 5654114 Seal off every exit in case any of 'em<br />tries to slip past us...
5654199 5657076 - to break out onto the ground.<br />- You got it.
5658870 5662081 All right, here we go.
5662248 5665084 Dick, this is nuts. Every station<br />in town has people at the airport...
5665168 5667378 and none has heard<br />a whisper of this shit you're running!
5667462 5670089 Well, none of them is me.<br />You want proof? Try this.
5670173 5673634 Repeat. Terrorists have murdered civilians...
5673718 5676762 and cut off the two systems<br />that can allow you to land.
5676846 5678889 A special U.S. Army unit<br />is already here...
5678973 5681266 - and preparing to take out the terrorists.<br />- Jesus Christ.
5681351 5683394 I want you to go live now.
5683478 5685521 Key me in from the files-<br />a publicity shot, whatever.
5685605 5687648 Connie's got one. And a map -<br />Steal one from weather.
5687732 5689900 We're on it. We're cutting<br />in five minutes!
5689984 5694405 Tell the affiliates if they want in,<br />they got three minutes to shout. Let's do this.
5694489 5697074 Network, here I come.
5700120 5704623 Hey, Telford, what was your chickenshit<br />outfit doing while we were taking Grenada?
5707585 5711755 Grenada - five minutes<br />of firefight, five weeks of surfing.
5711840 5713882 I wish I was with you guys for that.
5713967 5715926 Yeah. Me too, kid.
5716010 5719221 - Really, sir?<br />- Sure.
5719305 5721974 Then we wouldn't<br />have to do this.
5737365 5739908 Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.
5739993 5744079 On schedule and in position.
5744164 5746457 Roger, Hatchling.<br />We are secure here.
5746541 5752337 You have a green light.<br />I repeat, a green light.
5763057 5766935 Jesus, Officer, where'd you<br />come from, Pearl Harbor?
5771107 5774485 All right, let's clear it out, please.
5775528 5780115 Stand by. Five, four, three -
5780200 5783827 This is a special bulletin from WZDC News.
5783912 5786413 There was a plane crash<br />earlier this evening at Dulles...
5786498 5788499 where other aircraft<br />continue to circle...
5788583 5790959 with no explanation from<br />airport or F.A.A. officials.
5791044 5794254 - Shh! Quiet!<br />- And now, with an exclusive WZDC report...
5794339 5796882 here's Dick Thornberg reporting<br />from the skies over Washington.
5796966 5799968 - Can you turn it up?<br />- I'm one of the thousand people...
5800053 5802095 who has been circling<br />our nation's capital...
5802180 5806850 under the assumption that whatever problem<br />was going on far below was a normal one.
5806935 5808894 But the truth is far from normal.
5808978 5811188 The truth is terrifying.
5811272 5814483 Look out!<br />Lady, look out!
5814567 5817903 Look out! Look out!<br />Look out! Look out! Get out of the way!
5817987 5819947 Ho! Get out of the way!
5820031 5823951 - Move! Get out of the way, lady! Go! Go! Hey! Hey!<br />- Look out!
5824035 5825953 This is a recording<br />of a conversation...
5826037 5829206 between Dulles Tower<br />and the captive aircraft overhead.
5831501 5834211 Hey! Get out of the way!
5834295 5838090 - Lorenzo! Lorenzo!<br />- McClane, are you out of your fucking mind?
5838174 5840092 The Blue Light Team,<br />where are they?
5840176 5842803 Stuart's got explosives on the equipment<br />in the church rigged with a remote.
5842887 5846014 - Where's Grant?<br />- Grant's boys are gonna kill that son of a bitch and get it.
5846099 5850102 - They're gonna get on the plane and take off with him!<br />- Get the fuck out of here!
5850186 5853188 When the army canned Stuart,<br />he must have loaded that unit with his own men!
5853273 5856525 - Are you nuts? That firefight -<br />- Sideshow to jerk us off, buy 'em some time.
5856609 5858694 McClane, you are completely<br />around the fucking bend.
5858778 5861613 - You know that? You know what else? You're under arrest.<br />- You motherfucker!
5867954 5870873 Here! These are the bullets<br />they used out there tonight!
5870957 5873000 Blanks!
5874460 5877004 Jesus Christ.
5884721 5886680 This is Chief Lorenzo.
5886764 5889892 I want every officer recalled<br />and assembled in body armor and full weaponry...
5889976 5892185 in the motor pool<br />in five minutes.
5894939 5897316 It's time to kick ass.
5899068 5901445 Just like Iwo Jima!
5901529 5904740 Since then, this reporter<br />has learned that the terrorists...
5904824 5906825 have virtual control<br />of the entire airport -
5906910 5909995 a fact that the authorities<br />have repressed.
5910079 5912247 The terrorists<br />promise more bloodshed...
5912332 5914291 unless their demands are met.
5914375 5917878 And now that the special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport...
5917962 5922549 the likelihood of a full-scale and deadly battle<br />is dangerously close.
5943780 5946865 That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.
5946950 5948867 It's all over the airport.
5948952 5951036 300 people have died.
5951120 5953622 - When are we going to land?<br />- I have no information.
5953706 5956959 And unfortunately they may not be the last.
5957043 5959628 The horrifying fact<br />is that no one is safe...
5959712 5963674 either in the planes above Dulles<br />or in the terminal below.
5963758 5966718 The threat of a new and higher<br />body count at the airport...
5966803 5969054 hangs over the heads of everyone...
5969138 5973517 and the holiday season<br />of peace and love has become a nightmare.
5979357 5981274 All right, listen up!
5981359 5985320 All units, I want you<br />to converge on Hangar 11, all sides!
5985405 5987406 This car, McClane! Get in!
5987490 5991827 When the city blue show up with their<br />backup, they'll pick up the pieces!
5991911 5993870 Now, move out!
5993955 5997916 McClane, say hi<br />to my brother Vito.
5998001 6001169 - Merry Christmas.<br />- Hi.
6004841 6007551 Shit!
6007635 6011680 - Goddamn it to hell! Move that piece of shit!<br />- What's the matter with you?
6011764 6013682 I didn't even see you, man.
6013766 6016101 Will you move that goddamn<br />piece of shit out of here!
6016185 6020355 Vito, get the fuck out of the car and get your<br />ass in gear and help me, for Christ's sake!
6020440 6024317 Will you get -<br />Move that car back right now, lady!
6024402 6027654 - Right there. Right there. Get that.<br />- Hey, Coleman!
6027739 6031825 Sam! Sam Coleman!
6031909 6035579 - Hey, Coleman!<br />- Hi!
6035663 6038081 Coleman!
6038166 6041877 But at least the truth<br />is not among the hostages...
6041961 6046882 because I, Richard Thornberg,<br />just happened to be here...
6046966 6049718 to put his life and talent...
6049802 6052679 on the line for humanity<br />and country.
6052764 6054806 And if this should be<br />my final broadcast -
6058019 6061897 Amen to that... Dick.
6061981 6063899 Dick? We're live, Dick.
6063983 6068653 Where are you now?<br />Dick?
6068780 6071490 Truck lights approaching, sir.
6071574 6073909 They're here, right on schedule.
6073993 6077871 The hangar door,<br />open it. Clockwork.
6101896 6105774 Geez, you give me this story,<br />and I'll have your baby.
6105858 6107901 Not the kind of ride<br />I'm looking for.
6119497 6122916 Colonel, if I may say so,<br />you are some piece of work.
6123000 6126253 Thank you, Major.<br />You're not so bad yourself.
6126337 6128255 Congratulations<br />on your escape, sir.
6128339 6131883 Thank you, Major. Maybe you should<br />save them until we are all safe, hmm?
6131968 6134261 - Sir.<br />- My congratulations, gentlemen.
6134345 6137430 You've won a victory<br />for our way of life...
6137515 6141309 my pride, my admiration<br />and a kick-ass vacation.
6141394 6143562 Now get on board.
6173593 6176219 - What's the matter, cowboy, ride too rough?<br />- I don't like to fly.
6176304 6178889 - Then what are you doing here?<br />- I don't like to lose either.
6178973 6182184 Okay! Whoo! Here we go!
6190359 6194487 I don't know about you guys, but I've seen<br />enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime.
6194572 6196615 They don't get much of that<br />in the tropics, Major.
6196699 6200619 For you, gentlemen, we'll import it.
6202413 6205123 Shit! They left the hangar!
6206876 6210253 Right there. Right there.<br />Get that.
6210338 6212714 - All right, now what?<br />- Get in front of them! Take it down!
6212798 6214758 Block their path<br />so they can't get out of there!
6214842 6218887 I'm not playing chicken with a 200-ton plane!<br />I'm crazy, but I ain't that crazy. Forget it.
6218971 6220555 Dulles, this is Northeast 140.
6220640 6222974 - Request clearance on first available runway.<br />- That's Holly's plane.
6223059 6225727 Repeat. Request<br />emergency clearance.
6225811 6227979 I know you're not gonna answer,<br />but you better listen!
6228064 6230065 We're down to fumes,<br />and we have to land...
6230149 6232901 and in five minutes<br />we're coming in one way or another.
6232985 6235654 Goddamn it. That's my wife's plane!<br />Take it fucking down!
6235738 6238365 I'm not gettin'<br />in front of that plane!
6242161 6244704 All right, how about<br />getting over top of it?
6244789 6247499 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />this is the captain. Your attention.
6247583 6250919 We have no choice<br />but to attempt an emergency landing.
6251003 6253421 Please fasten your seat belts<br />and assume crash positions...
6253506 6255924 as instructed by your cabin attendants.
6256008 6258426 Let's have the emergency checklist.
6258511 6262472 Attention all air traffic on this frequency<br />in Dulles area. This is Northeast 140.
6262556 6265350 We're going to attempt<br />an emergency landing. Be advised.
6267311 6271064 I don't want to die. I don't want to die.<br />I don't want to die.
6271148 6273900 - Just buckle your seat belt.<br />- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
6273985 6277570 You're gonna be all right.<br />Lean forward now. Thank you.
6277655 6282033 God! Oh!
6284704 6286705 Oh, God.
6287873 6292085 Oh, God. Thy rod and<br />thy staff, they comfort me.
6298134 6301720 - Hang on! Hang on!<br />- What are you doing?
6301804 6303888 You wanted a story, didn't you?<br />Nice and easy, boys.
6303973 6306725 - Get me in low!<br />- You got it!
6308602 6311229 - Where are you going?<br />- Bring me down!
6311314 6314858 You'll get yourself killed!<br />Come back inside!
6321032 6323241 Bring it in low!<br />Keep over the wing!
6331625 6334085 Lower!
6342678 6346389 John, what the fuck are you doing<br />out on the wing of this plane?
6353314 6355899 Damn!
6360363 6361988 - Mierda.<br />- What?
6362073 6366242 There's something wrong.<br />The ailerons.
6366327 6368453 We can't take off.
6371374 6374292 Hijo de puta.<br />It's McClane again.
6375920 6379339 Son of a bitch!
6379423 6382467 - I'll do him.<br />- This time do it right.
6382551 6386137 You just get us in the air, General.<br />You're the only man who can do it.
6386222 6388139 Don't shoot.<br />That wing is fully fueled.
6440651 6443528 Too bad, McClane.<br />I kind of liked you!
6444321 6446781 Goddamn traitor!
6446866 6448533 Whoa!
6451579 6453705 I got enough friends!
6456208 6458209 Whoa!
6466844 6468845 Oh!
6475603 6478396 Oh!
6490367 6493411 Okay, McClane,<br />time for the main event!
6529573 6531616 This is for Flight 114, motherfucker!
6542002 6544295 How's it going?
6548133 6550593 Bon voyage!
6556934 6559227 Happy landings, asshole!
6609612 6612196 Yippie-kai-yay, motherfucker.
6624877 6626711 Yeah. All right.
6645898 6648566 Whoa!
6650903 6653905 Ah, fuck.
6657660 6660244 Oh!
6664625 6666542 Holly!
6666627 6670922 Here's your fucking<br />landing light! Whoo!
6676887 6680682 Oh, God.
6680766 6685144 - Look! Look!<br />- Okay. I see it! I see it!
6710504 6713464 They used the fire to see!<br />They used the fucking fire to see!
6713549 6716676 - They can all do that. Let's tell 'em.<br />- They already know.
