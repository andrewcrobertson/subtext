36870 41583 False alarm. Hold it! It's OK,<br />I'm here. It's all right.
43460 45420 - Set it down nice and easy.
45462 48131 - At the impound. Next<br />time, read the sign.
48173 50133 You don't understand. I'm here<br />to meet my wife's plane.
50175 52093 Let me have this car.
52135 55221 Sure. Tomorrow, 8.00 to 4.00.<br />Pay $40, we give it back.
55263 57182 Don't write it up!
57223 59184 This is my mother-in-law's car.
59225 61770 She's already mad at me<br />cos I'm not a dentist.
61811 65815 - Look, I'm a cop. LAPD.<br />- I was in LA once. Hated it.
66858 69235 I can understand. I don't like<br />it much...
69277 72405 That's a plastic fender up<br />there. Take it easy!
72447 75367 Cut me some slack, will you?<br />I was a cop in New York City.
75408 78745 I only moved to LA cos my wife<br />took a job there.
78787 79871 What do you say?
79913 83166 Here we are, Washington, DC, the<br />heart of democracy.
83208 85043 One hand<br />washes the other.
85085 86378 Come on, man. It's Christmas.
86419 89339 So ask Santa Claus to give you<br />another car.
89381 91174 Merry Christmas, pal.
92801 94803 It's all yours, Murray.
98390 99933 Son of a bitch.
141766 144019 - Hi. Where are the telephones?<br />- Over there.
144060 145937 Thank you very much.
145979 149733 <i>Leonard Adkins has a story<br />that grows hotter by the minute.</i>
149774 153486 <i>Security was tight today<br />at Escalan airport in Valverde,</i>
153528 156281 <i>where it is reported<br />that deposed general,</i>
156322 159284 <i>Ramón Esperanza, will be<br />delivered for extradition</i>
159325 160618 <i>to the United States.</i>
161369 164372 <i>Two years ago, the general led<br />his country's army</i>
164414 166958 <i>against communist insurgents</i>
167000 170170 <i>in a campaign fought with<br />American money and advisers.</i>
170211 172630 <i>Esperanza's fall from power<br />caused ripples</i>
172672 174632 <i>in his country's recent<br />election,</i>
174674 176968 <i>and closer to home as well,</i>
177010 179137 <i>when Pentagon officials<br />were charged with</i>
179179 182098 <i>supplying him with weapons,<br />despite the Congressional ban.</i>
182807 185560 <i>Evidence that Esperanza's forces<br />violated the</i>
185602 187437 <i>neutrality of<br />neighbouring countries</i>
187479 189564 <i>made Congress withhold funds.</i>
189606 192942 <i>Funds which Esperanza is accused<br />of replacing</i>
192984 195362 <i>by going into<br />cocaine smuggling.</i>
195403 199449 <i>Although Esperanza was removed<br />as commander in chief this year,</i>
199491 202744 <i>the agreement to extradite him<br />was only reached yesterday.</i>
202786 206790 <i>Washington insiders say a phone<br />call made it happen,</i>
209459 213129 <i>a phone<br />call from a...</i>
213171 214506 All right!
218426 221554 If I could find a phone,<br />I'd call you, whoever you are.
254004 255797 Excuse me. Thank you.
264723 267475 <i>This is Lieutenant McClane.<br />Somebody beep me?</i>
267517 269811 - I'd like to think I'm<br />somebody.
269853 272814 - Honey! Where are<br />you? Did you land yet?
272856 274816 It's the nineties, remember?
274858 278319 Microchips, microwaves, faxes,<br />air phones.
279612 281614 As far as I'm concerned,
281656 283700 progress peaked with frozen<br />pizza.
283742 287078 Listen, we're gonna be<br />about half an hour late landing.
287120 290457 I just wanted to let you know.<br />The kids OK?
290498 293460 They're about to lose their<br />minds from all the sugar
293501 294961 your<br />parents are giving them.
295003 297797 Did Mom give you a hard<br />time about borrowing her car?
297839 300008 No. Not yet.
300508 304846 Listen, honey, when you land,<br />can we just rent a car,
304888 308141 check into a hotel, leave the<br />kids with your parents?
308183 311644 Order some room service, a<br />bottle of champagne?
311686 313438 What do you<br />say?
313480 315482 You're on, Lieutenant.
315523 318735 I'll see you in half an hour,<br />honey. I love you. Bye.
323656 326076 Isn't technology wonderful?
327660 330455 - My husband doesn't think so.<br />- I do.
331581 334542 I used to carry around<br />those awful Mace things.
334584 335877 Now...
338171 341549 I zap any bastard that screws<br />with me.
343968 346179 I tried it on my little dog.
347514 349891 Poor thing limped for a week.
357399 358692 Excuse me.
360568 362487 You look really familiar to me.
362529 364989 I get that a lot. I've been on<br />TV.
365031 366825 Yeah. Me too.
391766 394060 - Grab the tools.<br />- You got it.

432349 434434 - I don't know anything<br />about that.
434476 437604 - Would you mind if we take a<br />look? - Help yourself.
449366 452535 It don't seem right somehow,<br />closing down this church.
452577 454954 The parish is gonna keep on<br />using it,
454996 456831 but it won't be the<br />same.
456873 460293 Been here a lot of years, and<br />I've been right here with it.
460335 463213 Yeah, I kind of feel like a<br />piece of me

529821 532657 Everyone's in position. How's<br />the weather?
532699 535744 We got flurries all along the<br />Virginia coast.
535785 538747 New storm front coming in<br />from the northeast.
539664 542334 - God loves the infantry.<br />- Amen.
543918 546046 Carry out your assignments.
548965 551718 - 15.51. Mark.<br />- Check.
553094 554429 Later.
577535 580538 It's cold out there, man!
583166 586169 I stomped my feet<br />for five minutes.
591132 593551 Two cappuccinos. Make it fast.
614739 619119 Excuse me, officers. This may<br />sound like a wild-goose chase,
619160 621371 but I think I saw...
621413 622914 Saw what?
623998 626793 Elvis. Elvis Presley.
629754 631881 Fucking tourists. Ought to be a<br />law.
632757 634801 There's a lot of you from<br />the Justice Department here.
634843 638763 - Is there any particular reason<br />for that? - Just routine.
639055 641599 - Any comment, sir?<br />- Not now.
642726 644436 Thank you, sir.
649441 651735 That's Colonel Stuart over<br />there.
652235 655363 Got a little problem with<br />personnel.
655405 656448 Last-minute<br />replacement.
656489 660035 - How's the security here?<br />- Like we figured... a joke.
660910 662829 Colonel Stuart,<br />could we have a few words?
662871 665123 You can have two: "fuck" and<br />"you".
665165 667584 No pictures, you pinko bitch.
669836 671129 Old news.
710794 712295 Hey, man.
714964 717175 - What is it?<br />- You got a key for this door?
717217 719052 Yeah. Why?
719094 722013 Because I want you to open it<br />up, that's why.
724641 727977 - Is there a cop on duty around<br />here? - The airport police.
728019 729562 Go get 'em.
767976 772313 All right. Perfect. Good to go.
775900 778987 It's a restricted area. What's<br />the matter?
779029 781990 - Couldn't wait for a skycap?<br />- We work here.
782198 784284 Let's see some ID.
784325 786411 Sure. No problem.
827660 829829 Jeez. Fuck!
877127 879045 This is a tag team?
912120 914039 He came in here and flashed a<br />badge?
914080 917000 Yeah. He said to bring you guys<br />back here.
944152 945737 Christ.
962921 964255 Fucker!
965340 966800 Freeze!
968093 971638 Nice guess, asshole.<br />I'm a cop. That was the bad guy.
972305 974140 Where's your ID?
978269 980313 On its way to Cleveland?
986194 988154 You did not explain anything.
988196 990990 You just shoved me back here<br />into this cattle car.
991032 993535 - Sir, you were told we were<br />overbooked.
993576 995161 - Fine. I accept<br />that.
995203 997288 But why can't I get the<br />first-class meal
997330 998373 my network paid<br />for?
998415 1000375 - Do you know who I am?<br />- Yes.
1000417 1001459 We've seen your programme.
1001501 1004754 Your episode "Flying Junkyards"<br />was an objective look
1004796 1006006 at<br />air-traffic safety.
1006047 1009259 It wasn't nearly as edifying<br />as "Bimbos of the Sky",
1009300 1010260 wasn't it, Connie?
1010301 1013138 You think you're funny.
1013430 1016474 Fine. I've got your number.
1016516 1019602 And I've got yours. So park it,<br />sir.
1022105 1023356 Fine.
1033116 1035869 - Stewardess.<br />- Mr Thornberg.
1035910 1038079 You cannot monopolise my time.
1038121 1041332 - You cannot put me near that<br />woman. - Excuse me?
1042834 1046338 He means he's filed<br />a restraining order against me.
1046629 1049174 I'm not allowed within 50 feet<br />of him.
1049215 1052677 50 yards. So by keeping me in<br />this section,
1052719 1055055 you are violating<br />a court order.
1055096 1057307 I can sue you and this airline.
1058224 1062020 That woman assaulted me,<br />and she humiliated me in public.
1070070 1071654 What did you do?
1073365 1075784 Knocked out two of his teeth.
1076326 1078328 Would you like some champagne?
1082248 1084918 Sorry, Officer McClane. I had to<br />check.
1084959 1087337 Here's your piece and shield<br />back.
1088213 1089631 Thanks.
1097222 1099599 Jesus! Christ!
1100517 1103228 What the fuck are you people...<br />What are you doing?
1103269 1106272 This is a crime scene.<br />You gotta seal this area off.
1106314 1107440 That's up to the captain.
1107482 1110735 Maybe you better take me up<br />to the captain.
1121871 1124582 - Where's Cochrane?<br />- He didn't make it.
1133717 1138304 - You're late.<br />- We ran into trouble, Colonel.
1138888 1142892 Some cop killed Cochrane.<br />I barely got away, sir.
1143977 1146229 Did you accomplish your mission?
1147272 1149399 Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.
1149441 1153194 Then the damage is minimal.<br />The penalty could be severe.
1162120 1165248 You fail me again,<br />and the chamber won't be empty.
1166458 1168043 Dismissed.
1184809 1186978 Who is it? Come in.
1187979 1190440 - Captain Lorenzo?<br />- Yeah.
1190482 1193109 - I'm John McClane...<br />- I know who you are.
1193151 1195612 You're the asshole<br />that just broke seven FAA
1195653 1197906 and five District of Columbia<br />regulations
1197947 1201326 running around my airport<br />with a gun, shooting at people.
1201368 1204704 - What do you call that shit?<br />- Self-defence.
1205288 1209292 You think that LA badge is gonna<br />get you a free lunch or
1209334 1210335 something around here?
1210377 1213713 No. Maybe a little professional<br />courtesy.
1213755 1217217 In an airport on Christmas week?<br />You gotta be kidding.
1217258 1220178 OK, fuck courtesy.<br />How about being professional?
1220220 1223181 Your boys just walked away<br />from a crime scene.
1223223 1225392 You can't wrap this up in ten<br />minutes.
1225433 1227644 You got to seal the area off,<br />dust for prints...
1227686 1229562 Don't lecture me, hotshot.
1229604 1232899 I know what I'm doing.<br />We're gonna dust it down.
1232941 1235985 We'll take all the pictures.<br />We'll sweep for fibres.
1236027 1238947 After 400 people go through<br />there?
1238988 1240990 You'd be lucky to get a print<br />from one of your people.
1241032 1244160 - Just shut down that area...<br />- Shut the area down?
1244202 1247288 It's that simple? Just shut the<br />area down?
1247330 1250166 I got everybody<br />from the Shriners' convention
1250208 1252919 to the goddamn Boy Scouts in<br />here.
1252961 1256381 I got lost kids, lost dogs...<br />Not now. Later!
1256423 1258591 I got international diplomats.
1258633 1261261 I got a fuckin' reindeer flying<br />in here
1261302 1262971 from the fuckin' petting<br />zoo.
1263013 1266391 But John McClane,<br />he's got a little problem.
1266433 1268601 Let's shut down the whole<br />fuckin' airport.
1268643 1273064 - What do you think they'll say<br />upstairs? - Phone and find out.
1273106 1276067 I don't need fuckin' forensics<br />to tell me
1276109 1278361 this was some punk<br />stealing luggage!
1278403 1280905 Luggage? That punk pulled a<br />Glock 7 on me.
1280947 1283658 That's a porcelain gun made in<br />Germany.
1283700 1285618 It doesn't show up on X-ray<br />machines
1285660 1287746 and it costs more than you make<br />in a month.
1287787 1290373 You'd be surprised<br />what I make in a month.
1290415 1291916 If it's more than $1.98...
1291958 1295337 Hey, McClane, don't start<br />believing your own press.
1295378 1299299 Yeah, I know all about you<br />and that Nakatomi thing in LA.
1299341 1301718 But just cos the TV thinks<br />you're hot shit,
1301760 1303094 that don't make<br />it so.
1303136 1306014 Look, you are in my little pond<br />now,
1306056 1308516 and I am the big fish that runs<br />it.
1309642 1312354 So you capped some lowlife.<br />Fine.
1312395 1316775 I'll send your fuckin' captain<br />in LA a fuckin' commendation.
1316816 1319194 Now, get the hell out of my<br />office
1319235 1322405 before I have you thrown out<br />of my goddamn airport.
1332749 1335168 Carmine, let me ask you<br />something.
1335210 1337671 What sets off the metal<br />detectors first?
1337712 1340507 The lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1340548 1342133 Fat fuck.
1351643 1355355 - Any ID on this guy? - That's<br />somebody else's problem.
1357857 1360360 Okay, your car is ready.<br />You could just sign right here.
1360402 1364197 I need to borrow this and this.<br />I'll bring it right back.
1366866 1368368 Hold up!
1372455 1374958 Hold up, boys. We gotta check<br />something.
1375000 1378461 - What are you doing?<br />- Pretty gruesome fuckin' job.
1378503 1382173 All the confusion in there,
1382215 1386636 forgot to get this<br />clown's prints.
1386678 1388013 Christ.
1388054 1389514 You're supposed to do that at<br />the morgue.
1389556 1393309 Not any more. Got a new SOP<br />for DOAs from the FAA.
1397480 1400942 I don't think this one's gonna<br />make it. Thanks a lot.
1514514 1516474 - Powell here.
1516516 1519185 - Take that Twinkie<br />out of your mouth.
1519227 1521771 - John, how ya doing?<br />- Holly stood me up a day
1521813 1525191 and I'm here alone in DC with my<br />in-laws.
1526192 1528153 The old in-laws?
1528194 1530780 Man, they do love their<br />policemen son-in-laws.
1530822 1533575 Listen, Al, what is the fax<br />machine telephone number
1533616 1534909 there at the station?
1539664 1541624 555 3212.
1541666 1544336 3212. Hold on a second, all<br />right?
1544377 1546296 I wanna send you<br />something.
1546338 1547630 Excuse me.
1547672 1550717 <i>You and faxes? This is a first.</i>
1550759 1554095 Holly told me I should wake up<br />and smell the nineties.
1554137 1556264 - This way?<br />- No. That way.
1556639 1559100 - It's upside down.<br />- It doesn't matter.
1559142 1560810 Here it comes.
1563480 1567275 - I'm sending you something now.<br />- Hold on a second, cowboy.
1582749 1584709 - Fingerprints?
1584751 1585794 <i>- We've got an<br />unidentified stiff.</i>
1585835 1588922 I've circled the whorls in case<br />the transmission's fuzzy.
1588963 1592008 Run it through State and<br />Federal, and maybe Interpol.
1592050 1595804 - Will do. What's this about?<br />- Just a feeling I have.
1596638 1598682 Ouch. When you get those<br />feelings,
1598723 1600767 insurance companies<br />start to go bankrupt.
1600809 1602644 The fax number is...
1602686 1604813 On the top of the transmission<br />you just got.
1604854 1607982 On the top of the transmission<br />you just got.
1610944 1615198 An airport? You're not<br />pissing in somebody's pool?
1616616 1619119 Yeah, and I'm fresh out of<br />chlorine.
1619869 1622122 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
1625375 1627544 Just as this storm starts<br />breaking,
1627585 1630964 the satellite-feed up<br />and drops the other shoe on us.
1631006 1632632 Look at this new front moving<br />in.
1632674 1635760 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chickenshit.
1637053 1640974 I can sand down the runways and<br />run the ploughs between landings
1641016 1643643 but you gotta downshift them,<br />give me time to work.
1643685 1645228 You got it.
1646396 1650400 All right, everyone.<br />Let's slow down our birds
1650442 1652736 before we get a parking lot over<br />our heads.
1652777 1654029 The line starts at the<br />Mississippi,
1659784 1661786 and they better<br />start taking numbers.
1666833 1668752 Can I get you another?
1671838 1673798 No, thank you.
1673840 1677719 I only have to look at his<br />face for another 20 minutes.
1677761 1679721 <i>This is the captain speaking.</i>
1679763 1682807 <i>I've just been informed by<br />Dulles traffic control</i>
1682849 1685852 <i>that there's a weather front<br />ahead of us.</i>
1685894 1688855 <i>We may be up here a little while<br />longer.</i>
1688897 1691608 - Thank you.<br />- On second thought...
1700200 1702827 I'm right here, partner.
1702869 1707499 Your stiff's dossier<br />is coming through now.
1707540 1708667 <i>- What can you tell me about<br />him?</i>
1708708 1709876 <i>- He's dead.</i>
1709918 1711795 You needed a computer to figure<br />that out?
1711836 1714005 No, you don't follow me.
1714464 1716424 According to the Department of<br />Defense,
1716466 1718259 he's been dead for two<br />years.
1718301 1720261 - What?
1720303 1722430 <i>- That's right. Sergeant<br />Oswald Cochrane.</i>
1722472 1724891 American adviser in Honduras.
1725308 1727811 Killed in a helicopter accident,<br />5-11-88.
1727852 1729270 Officer.
1730605 1732774 <i>Read between the lines and it<br />looks like</i>
1732816 1734192 <i>a lot of black-bag<br />stuff.</i>
1734234 1737028 I see it. All right, Al. Thanks<br />a lot.
1737070 1739197 - Any time.<br />- OK.
1741658 1745495 I close in about an hour.<br />Maybe we can go get a drink?
1747997 1750834 Just the fax, ma'am.
1756089 1759426 Wait a second, I see somebody.<br />I'll call you back.
1765557 1767183 The ghost of Christmas past.
1767225 1769769 Nakatomi? LA?<br />You're John McClane, right?
1769811 1772897 - Who are you?<br />- Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
1773773 1775734 - Excuse me.
1775775 1777235 - Give me a break.<br />I saw the stiff.
1777277 1779237 Word is, that was your<br />handiwork.
1779279 1781698 No. I only do needlepoint.
1787412 1791332 Great. National just shut down.<br />Totally iced.
1791374 1794210 - They'll send us their planes.<br />- Happy holiday.
1794252 1796755 The worst part, Mr Trudeau, is<br />the press.
1796796 1799758 They were here for the Esperanza<br />story,
1799799 1802844 so they got it right on the<br />news, bloodstains and all.
1802886 1806431 I'd like to lock every damn<br />reporter out of the airport,
1806473 1809017 but they'd pull that<br />freedom-of-speech crap on us,
1809059 1811603 then the ACLU would be all<br />over us.
1811644 1815273 Murder on television. Hell of a<br />start for Christmas week.
1817025 1819110 What is it? A gang thing like<br />last time?
1819152 1822572 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1823531 1825867 - Who the hell is this?<br />- I'm a police officer...
1825909 1830163 In an unauthorised area.<br />LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1830497 1833792 That's what I said about<br />my last cholesterol test.
1834250 1837170 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1838213 1840465 I'm sure Captain Lorenzo has<br />explained to you
1840507 1843176 the minor fracas with the minor<br />thieves.
1843218 1845428 Maybe he can explain this.
1864197 1867200 <i>- All systems tapped, Colonel.<br />- Fire it up.</i>
1882132 1884926 H minus five minutes. Stand by.
1887178 1890849 We've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1890890 1893685 Assuming it's not an error,<br />what do we assume?
1893727 1895979 Somebody's about to fuck<br />with this airport.
1896021 1898064 What the hell does that mean?
1898106 1902152 I know we're dummies up here, so<br />give us a taste of your genius.
1902193 1904154 A hijacking, a robbery or what?
1904195 1906740 - I'm not sure...<br />- He's not sure.
1906781 1909200 I'm stunned. I gotta lie down.
1909242 1911578 Only professionals go to this<br />much trouble.
1911619 1913329 Not luggage<br />thieves or punks.
1913371 1915331 - Professional at what?
1915373 1916666 - What the fuck do<br />you think this is?
1916708 1919002 The safety patrol? This is the<br />résumé
1919044 1920378 of a professional<br />mercenary.
1920420 1922380 A major drug dealer is due here.
1922422 1924007 You need a slide rule to solve<br />this,
1924049 1927135 or another body in a bag<br />before you ask questions?
1927177 1930764 You're the one that gave us that<br />fucking body. Remember that.
1930805 1932724 Yeah, I remember that.
1939147 1942776 Lorenzo, have all your<br />shift commanders report in. Now.
1942817 1944778 - What? You're not buying into<br />this?
1944819 1946780 - They're to report anything<br />unusual,
1946821 1948615 - no matter how trivial. Got<br />that?
1948656 1949616 - I got it.
1949657 1952118 - My God.<br />- What?
1952160 1954996 - The runways. Look.<br />- What the hell?
1955038 1958083 - They're shutting down.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1964172 1966841 Go to emergency lighting. Now.
1966883 1969260 - Emergency. We are in a code<br />yellow.
1969302 1971096 - Backup systems won't<br />come up.
1971137 1973014 - Shunt to another terminal.<br />- Bobby, what have you got?
1973056 1974182 <i>Please respond. Please respond.</i>
1974224 1978061 - The network is down. - Should<br />we call the power company?
1978103 1980105 We're on the same grid and we're<br />hot.
1980146 1982065 <i>Dulles, I'm on approach.</i>
1982107 1985276 - Maintain position. Repeat.<br /><i>- What's going on down there?</i>
1985318 1988029 - We're on it.<br />- We're unable right now. Delay.
1988071 1991533 Fuji 604. Execute published<br />missed-approach procedure
1991574 1992742 and<br />hold.
1992784 1995870 TWA 23, unable to clear you<br />for approach at this time.
1995912 1998081 Climb to and maintain one zero<br />thousand.
1998123 2001126 I've checked all systems.<br />It ain't happening.
2016975 2019728 - What's it look like?<br />- Approach control is gone.
2019769 2022689 Jesus. Instrument landing system<br />is down.
2024107 2026276 Confirmed. ILS is dead.
2026317 2030238 Every goddamn system's dead.<br />And Inmac monitors are down.
2035577 2039039 Attention all controllers.<br />We have a code-red alert.
2039789 2041750 Every aircraft approaching our<br />sector,
2041791 2044210 and not already in our<br />landing pattern,
2044252 2047047 gets diverted to their alternate<br />airport.
2047088 2051468 Everyone already on approach,<br />or inside our pattern,
2051509 2054095 holds at the outer markers.
2054137 2057223 Stack 'em, pack 'em and rack<br />'em. Move.
2063229 2065899 Not a word of this leaves this<br />room.
2065940 2068985 There must be 15,000 people in<br />this airport,
2069027 2070945 and we don't need<br />panic.
2070987 2073656 We just bought ourselves<br />maybe two hours.
2074157 2077118 After that, planes low on fuel<br />won't be circling.
2077160 2080372 They'll be dropping<br />on the White House lawn.
2081956 2084834 McClane, this what you expected?
2086753 2088129 No.
2089089 2091341 This is just the beginning.
2094969 2098139 - FAA hot line.<br />- How could they know already?
2098181 2099724 They can't.
2101226 2104104 Maybe it's the boys<br />who pulled your plugs.
2104145 2105814 Put it on speaker.
2106690 2109442 <i>Attention, Dulles tower.<br />Attention.</i>
2109484 2111861 <i>They say blind men become very<br />attentive</i>

2124082 2127002 How did you get on this line?<br />Who is this?
2127419 2130213 Who I am is unimportant. What I<br />want...
2131756 2134175 If you don't want planes to<br />splash into the Potomac
2134217 2135677 as they<br />run out of fuel,
2135719 2138179 what I want is very important.
2138221 2141307 <i>A plane will be landing<br />at this airport in 58 minutes.</i>
2141349 2144436 It is FM-1: Foreign Military<br />One.
2144686 2147105 <i>- I'm sure you are aware of the<br />nature of this flight...</i>
2147147 2148106 <i>- Esperanza?</i>
2148148 2151067 <i>...the importance of its cargo.</i>
2151317 2154362 This plane will not be met by<br />anyone.
2155238 2157824 It will land on a runway of my<br />designation,
2157866 2160952 where it will remain isolated<br />and unapproached.
2161327 2164080 That will conclude my interest<br />in this aircraft
2164122 2165874 and your<br />responsibility for it.
2165915 2169919 At the same time, I want a 747<br />cargo conversion fully fuelled
2171796 2174299 <i>and placed at my disposal.</i>
2174341 2177302 <i>You have two minutes to advise<br />inbound aircraft to hold</i>
2177344 2178845 <i>at their outer radio marker.</i>
2178887 2181931 <i>After that, you will be able to<br />receive only.</i>
2182182 2184559 Any attempt to restore your<br />systems,
2184601 2186978 will be met by severe<br />penalties.
2187020 2188480 He's bluffing.
2189356 2192650 - Damn it, you can't do this.<br />- I am doing this.
2201117 2204412 I need you to punch up a code<br />15. I got an idea,
2204454 2205705 and I need<br />your help.
2205747 2209000 If Esperanza gets to a country<br />with no extradition treaties,
2209042 2210168 we're fucked.
2210210 2213213 They're talking to us on our<br />system. They gotta be close.
2213254 2215215 - My men will tear this airport<br />apart.
2215256 2216841 - Just in the nick of<br />time.
2216883 2220011 I got a first-class unit, SWAT<br />team and all.
2220053 2222055 We don't need<br />Monday morning quarterbacks.
2222097 2225266 My wife's on one of the planes<br />they're fucking with!
2225308 2227227 So I'm on<br />the playing field.
2227268 2230271 If you'd have moved before,<br />we wouldn't be deep in shit.
2230313 2232607 That's it. Security. You're<br />outta here.
2232649 2235735 Mr Trudeau, there are FAA<br />regulations
2235777 2238780 regarding unauthorised personnel<br />in the control tower!
2238822 2240907 We just have to find a way to<br />transmit.
2240949 2243576 Run down to Radio Shack<br />for a transmitter.
2243618 2246287 We have one - the terminal wing<br />they're building.
2246329 2249416 20 airlines when it's done,<br />all with reservation computers
2249457 2251543 in a nice antenna arrangement.
2251584 2253545 - See Mr McClane out.
2253586 2255505 - You got no business<br />being up here.
2255547 2258299 Everything we need<br />is by the annexe skywalk,
2258341 2261011 just sitting there, waiting to<br />go on line.
2261052 2264097 Goddamn it, Trudeau,<br />you're dealing with pros.
2264139 2266349 You can't fuck with these<br />people.
2266391 2268351 Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
2268393 2270145 There are a lot of<br />rumours flying around...
2270186 2272647 No way, lady. Hell, no.
2272689 2274899 This is off limits, Coleman.
2276443 2279362 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of, too!
2279404 2283158 - Get your fucking hands off me.<br />- Just get 'em out of here.
2284576 2287620 - Lobby security, come in.<br />- Tomalson here.
2287662 2289622 This is Captain Lorenzo.
2289664 2291541 We've two unauthorised<br />personnel in the tower.
2291583 2294544 Get your thumb out of your ass.<br />Get 'em out of the elevator,
2294586 2297339 or you'll get a pink slip for<br />Christmas.
2297380 2298965 10-4. Let's go.
2300467 2301885 Goddamn!
2302677 2306431 - Anything who can think of?<br />- Shit. Hang on over there.
2306473 2309225 - What for?<br />- Just hang on!
2310101 2313313 Big drug dealer on his way to<br />prison. Gunfight at airport.
2313355 2315982 Every controller in the coffee<br />shop getting beeped,
2316024 2317650 and you<br />rocking the boat.
2317692 2320070 - Connection? Come on, just a<br />few words.
2320111 2322530 - OK, just a few<br />words. Fuck off.
2322572 2326076 Thanks, but I already got<br />that from Colonel Stuart.
2327077 2331539 Stuart. The guy that got canned<br />by Congress. That's who he was.
2331581 2333875 Who he who? What?
2333917 2336378 It's OK, I've done this before.
2347305 2349307 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2349349 2352477 - Where's the other one?<br />- Claustrophobic, I guess.
2354354 2357607 It's a VHF system, but the<br />planes are so close, it's OK.
2357649 2359943 I can rig our frequency in 30<br />minutes,
2359984 2361444 and wire in a<br />crossover.
2361486 2363446 - You wouldn't know the<br />difference.
2363488 2365532 - Get what you need.<br />Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2365573 2367867 I want my SWAT team<br />to go with him as cover.
2367909 2371162 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of, too.
2376710 2379170 Man, I can't fucking believe<br />this.
2379212 2382048 Another basement. Another<br />elevator.
2382090 2385468 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?
2406614 2408199 What the fuck?
2443443 2444819 Who are you?
2446571 2448865 I'm Marvin.
2450367 2453370 I thought you was trying<br />to steal my records.
2453411 2455288 I'm just the janitor.

2553053 2555680 This must be it right there.<br />See?
2556181 2560143 That's the raised platform and<br />there's the new terminal.
2560185 2561478 There's your skywalk.
2561519 2564814 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2566858 2568818 What's the fastest way<br />you can get me out to that spot?
2572364 2575033 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2575075 2578078 - Mr Barnes, we'll watch your<br />back.
2584167 2587170 - Yeah? Who watches yours?
2590715 2592634 Main ventilation duct.
2593009 2596971 Ventilation duct... and bingo.
2597514 2601643 Just once, I'd like<br />a regular, normal Christmas.
2603687 2607107 Eggnog, a fucking Christmas<br />tree,
2608775 2610527 a little turkey.
2611653 2615949 But, no. I gotta crawl around<br />in this motherfuckin' tin can.
2621162 2624040 We're in the annexe skywalk.<br />I can see the array.
2624082 2627460 I'll give you a call for a<br />protocol test when it's hot.
2627502 2628628 That's all for now.
2628670 2631840 Sergeant, we need more<br />equipment.
2631881 2634884 I'd like to send one<br />of your guys for it.
2638304 2641683 - What the hell's going on?<br />- Put that back on!
2644436 2648440 - Hey, asshole, what do I look<br />like to you?
2650984 2653570 - A sitting duck.
2653611 2654988 Shit!
2656781 2659409 Damn it. I hate it when I'm<br />right.
2766016 2767767 Stay down!
2781990 2783158 Fuck.
2814731 2816608 Fucking son of a bitch.
2833124 2834542 Shit.
2844969 2847430 I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.
2880964 2883591 - Jeez.<br />- You all right?
2884300 2888304 Yeah. But the antenna array,<br />I gotta get to it and set it up.
2892851 2894310 Get down!
2913413 2914914 Goddamn.
2917834 2919002 Bait.
2921046 2922630 Jerk us off.
2924090 2926634 Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best<br />men.
2930347 2932390 Make you waste your time.
2935894 2937312 Time we don't have.
2951993 2954496 I think you're closer than 50<br />yards.
2954537 2957749 So's that airplane. Practically.
2957791 2959834 Yeah. There's quite a few of<br />them.
2959876 2961961 It looks like a regular<br />traffic jam.
2962003 2964589 There's nothing regular about<br />it.
2965215 2967008 See? You're intrigued.
2967050 2970136 That's my gift, Mrs McClane.<br />I notice things.
2970178 2972389 Things other people wouldn't<br />see.
2972430 2975100 That's how I make people<br />curious.
2975141 2977394 Don't you mean nauseous?
2977435 2981064 The people have a right to know<br />everything about everybody.
2981564 2983024 You got in the way of that.
2983066 2985777 Listen, buster.<br />You endangered my children.
2985819 2989447 You didn't do it for anything as<br />noble as "the people".
2989489 2990990 The only time you see the people
2991032 2994619 is when you look down to see<br />what you're stepping on.
2998748 3002877 Me? I'll live,<br />but Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead
3003211 3005547 and the antenna array is gone.
3006047 3007966 Didn't you see it?
3009509 3011970 Start looking for a new miracle.
3016266 3019185 Hold for a second. Something's<br />going on.
3021146 3024065 I say again, annexe team, give<br />us a sit rep.
3025817 3028111 Annexe team, come in. Do you<br />copy?
3029779 3033241 It's got a scrambler on it.<br />Can you do anything with it?
3035160 3038788 No. This scramble mode must<br />activate on this code panel.
3038830 3041916 Even if we scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in.
3041958 3043209 These guys<br />are pros.
3043251 3046212 So are you. Break the code.<br />I wanna hear these bastards.
3046254 3049591 This is a ten-digit control<br />panel. Six-digit read-out.
3049632 3052135 Hell, there could be<br />a million combinations.
3052177 3055764 Next time you kill one of these<br />guys,
3055805 3058975 get him to enter the code<br />first.
3059017 3062020 Sir, we monitored a call from<br />their chief engineer.
3062062 3064105 We took<br />out their SWAT team.
3064147 3067275 So they did go for the antenna<br />array. We're on schedule.
3067317 3070278 Losing our team wasn't part of<br />the plan.
3076785 3079996 Attention, Dulles control tower.
3080413 3082749 <i>Mr Trudeau, I know you're<br />listening.</i>
3082791 3084751 <i>- Unfortunately, you're not<br />obeying.</i>
3084793 3086419 <i>- Try me face to face.</i>
3086461 3088880 You were warned<br />not to restore your systems.
3088922 3091132 <i>You've wasted lives and precious<br />time</i>
3091174 3093385 <i>on a futile and obvious<br />target.</i>
3093426 3095470 Now you're gonna pay the<br />penalty.
3095512 3098348 I got five dead officers,<br />Colonel Stuart.
3098390 3100016 Isn't that<br />penalty enough?
3100058 3103228 McClane, keep out of this.<br />You've been a pain...
3104771 3108400 McClane. John McClane.
3109401 3113530 The policeman hero who saved<br />the Nakatomi hostages.
3113571 3115365 <i>I read about you in People<br />magazine.</i>
3115407 3118118 <i>You seemed out of<br />your league on Nightline.</i>
3118159 3121996 Colonel, blow me. How much drug<br />money is Esperanza paying you
3122038 3123081 to turn traitor?
3123123 3125375 Cardinal Richelieu said it best:
3125417 3128628 "Treason is merely a matter of<br />dates."
3128670 3132132 <i>This country's got to learn it<br />can't keep cutting the legs off</i>
3132173 3133299 <i>of men like Esperanza.</i>
3133341 3137220 Men who have the guts to stand<br />up against communist aggression.
3138555 3141850 Lesson one starts with killing<br />policemen?
3141891 3145228 What's lesson two,<br />the neutron bomb?
3145270 3148356 No. I think we can find<br />something in-between.
3150358 3151985 Watch this.
3152944 3156114 Give me a flight number.<br />One that's low on fuel.
3157240 3159576 Windsor 114. Transatlantic from<br />London.
3159617 3162454 Fuel tank's dry as a<br />martini.
3162495 3166499 Activate the ILS landing system,<br />but recalibrate sea level...
3186061 3188063 minus 200 feet.
3193943 3197989 Jesus. They've reset<br />ground level, minus 200 feet.
3198615 3202911 Windsor flight 114. This is<br />Dulles approach. Do you copy?
3204204 3206164 Dulles approach, this is Windsor<br />114.
3206206 3207665 Where the devil have you<br />been?
3207707 3211836 <i>Windsor 114. We've been right<br />here all along, old buddy.</i>
3212379 3215006 <i>Our systems only came back on<br />line just now.</i>
3216049 3221054 <i>Windsor 114, you are cleared for<br />ILS approach, runway two-niner.</i>
3221846 3223848 <i>- Contact Dulles at the outer<br />marker.</i>
3223890 3226226 <i>- Jesus Christ, he's<br />gonna crash the plane.</i>
3226267 3228228 Roger, approach, and about time.
3228269 3231606 I've got 230 people up here<br />flying on petrol fumes.
3231648 3234401 <i>Roger, 114. Understand.<br />Calibrate Dulles...</i>
3234442 3235819 - Jesus.
3235860 3237112 - They'll fly right into the<br />concrete.
3237153 3238571 Son of a bitch!
3239406 3242784 - Why are they listening to him?<br />- It's our frequency.
3243326 3244744 Damn.
3244786 3246913 - Barnes.<br /><i>- This is Dulles tower.</i>
3246955 3249082 <i>We have radar contact...</i>
3249666 3251459 Give me your coat.
3252335 3256506 - What are you gonna do?<br />- Whatever I can.
3260301 3263805 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we've started our descent.
3263847 3265807 <i>Sorry for the inconvenience,</i>
3265849 3267559 <i>but we'll all be on<br />the ground shortly.</i>
3267600 3270812 Please keep your seat belts on.
3270854 3273481 We've made arrangements for your<br />next flight,
3273523 3275442 so you won't miss it.
3275483 3277402 In your seat, please.
3281072 3283033 We're just like British Rail,<br />love.
3283074 3284701 We may be late, but we get<br />you there.
3284743 3286286 Don't worry.
3303053 3304763 Good luck, McClane!
3327452 3331039 Dulles, this is Windsor 114<br />inside the outer marker.
3331623 3334542 Roger, 114. This is Dulles<br />tower.
3334584 3336795 We have radar contact<br />and show you on ILS.
3336836 3339673 You're in the glide path and<br />looking good.
3349015 3351267 There's somebody out there!
3355313 3358108 It's McClane. Christ.
3362570 3364406 Approach flaps.
3366449 3368159 Approach speed 140.
3369619 3371162 130.
3371788 3373748 - Altitude 1,000 feet.
3373790 3375458 - 800, guys. You're<br />only at 800 feet.
3375500 3379587 <i>Fire and rescue. Roll everything<br />onto runway two-niner.</i>
3380296 3384009 <i>Ref speed plus 20. 600 feet.</i>
3385510 3387846 Looking good, Windsor. Watch it.
3387887 3391224 30-knot crosswinds and the<br />runway is icy.
3391266 3393309 Attaboy. We've gotcha.
3394436 3395895 We've gotcha.
3409242 3410618 Pull it up!
3411619 3412704 Jesus!
3427594 3428928 We've gotcha.
3455955 3457290 God.
3462128 3463630 Motherfucker.
3485402 3488530 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3488571 3491116 If the 747 we requested is ready<br />on time
3491157 3494536 and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested,
3494577 3496830 further lessons can be avoided.
3496871 3498206 Out.
3544169 3548089 We got no sign of survivors.<br />It's a goddamn nightmare.
3563104 3566024 Barnes! We've got to warn those<br />planes
3566066 3568610 there's a lunatic pretending<br />he's the tower.
3568651 3570487 Get me on the<br />air.
3570528 3572739 - How?<br />- You figure it out!
3573239 3575075 Here's the manifest.
3595220 3597764 I know how you must feel.
3602686 3605522 I wanted to help those people<br />tonight.
3606606 3608983 I was pretty goddamn useless.
3613029 3615657 We called the government for<br />help.
3615699 3619285 They're gonna send in a<br />Special army unit.
3619327 3621454 A counterterrorist team.
3628837 3630630 Your wife's plane...
3631673 3635510 They're still broadcasting,<br />even though we can't answer.
3637637 3640557 They're gonna run out of fuel<br />in 90 minutes.
3652235 3654863 Listen, Dick. That is your name?
3655530 3659534 Dick. If you're gonna continue<br />to get this close,
3660869 3663246 could you<br />switch aftershaves?
3663288 3664748 Anything else?
3665582 3667959 Stronger mouthwash might be<br />nice.
3668752 3671463 <i>Sam Coleman is reporting<br />live from the accident.</i>
3671504 3675717 Colonel, they've done everything<br />we've anticipated... so far.
3675759 3678887 <i>But still there has been no<br />official word.</i>
3678928 3681931 <i>Despite the fact that only one<br />runway has been closed</i>
3681973 3683183 <i>due to<br />the tragedy,</i>
3683224 3685894 <i>several dozen airliners are<br />visible,</i>
3685935 3688063 <i>endlessly circling the<br />field.</i>
3688104 3691399 <i>Other reports say there<br />had been trouble in the tower,</i>
3691441 3693818 <i>and that may have contributed to<br />it.</i>
3693860 3696279 <i>With weather conditions<br />worsening,</i>
3696321 3699699 <i>the problem here and in<br />the sky above us will grow.</i>
3699741 3702827 <i>I'm Samantha Coleman<br />at Dulles International Airport.</i>
3710377 3713463 - Victor.<br />- Yeah, what's up?
3713505 3716383 Did you pack the radio mikes<br />from the shoot or are they here?
3716424 3718843 I wouldn't let those assholes<br />check 'em in!
3718885 3720387 I love you.
3720428 3722764 Give me one of the receivers.
3726851 3729729 Can you tune into the cockpit<br />frequency?
3730063 3733024 - Yeah. Why?<br />- I wanna hear what's going on.
3735819 3738196 Should be right here on our<br />band.
3738947 3741741 - Nothing. - You said it would<br />work. Is it working?
3741783 3744411 It is working, but all I'm<br />getting is
3744452 3746079 some kind of airport<br />beacon.
3746121 3749124 It's weird. It's like the tower<br />isn't there.
3752127 3753795 Stay on it.
3755046 3759050 Let me know<br />when there is something there.
3796880 3798214 - Major Grant.
3798256 3799215 - Rollins, Department<br />of Justice.
3799257 3801426 Trudeau, Chief of Air<br />Operations.
3801468 3805722 Lorenzo, Terminal Police.<br />You want something, you got it.
3805764 3808683 This is it? One fucking platoon?
3808725 3811394 - One crisis, one platoon. Who<br />are you?
3811436 3812437 - John McClane.
3812479 3815523 - You showed some balls out<br />there.
3815565 3816566 - Yeah.
3816608 3820528 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3820570 3823698 Looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3823740 3825867 - Isn't Colonel Stuart one of<br />your men?
3825909 3826993 - Not any more.
3827035 3829120 We're here to take Colonel<br />Stuart down.
3829162 3830997 And we will take<br />him down.
3831039 3834918 I served with him. I taught him<br />everything he knows.
3834959 3837962 Maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3840090 3842509 Let's hustle. The command post<br />will be set up
3842550 3843927 in the airport<br />police station.
3843968 3846971 I wanna be tied in to the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3847013 3848765 Let's do it!
3854312 3856815 Things just get better or worse?
3860694 3862654 - Lights. Big, portable lights.
3862696 3864698 - We set up the field, and then<br />we...
3864739 3866408 Wait for those lunatics to shoot<br />'em out?
3866449 3869244 Where do we get the lights?<br />From Batman?
3869285 3871287 - What about the air phone idea?
3871329 3873915 - 18 planes are up there. Five<br />have phones.
3873957 3876334 We got through to three.<br />We're trying the others.
3876376 3878044 That's 13 accidents waiting to<br />happen.
3878086 3879170 -Are they still bucking<br />headwinds?
3879212 3880213 -I just checked the<br />weather.
3880255 3882590 Headwinds are slamming everybody<br />over the outer marker.
3883008 3885010 The planes with enough fuel<br />have been shunted to Atlanta,
3885051 3886052 Memphis and Nashville.
3887637 3890056 Outer marker. Damn!
3890932 3892767 The outer marker!
3893351 3896146 It's a beacon. It sends out this<br />"beep beep beep"
3896187 3897856 so they know<br />they're over it.
3897897 3899858 - So?
3899899 3900900 - Who says that signal<br />has to just beep?
3900942 3902986 Right. Switch the frequency from<br />the tower
3903028 3904779 to the one in the<br />beacon.
3904821 3906072 Pump up the wattage.
3906114 3908742 We can talk to our planes,
3908783 3912787 and those bastards who did<br />this will never know!
3912829 3916041 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3916082 3918835 They've been tapped into<br />your tower chatter all night.
3918877 3921296 Punks stealing luggage, Carmine?
3924549 3927177 - How you doin', Telford?<br />- No good.
3927218 3929471 I called Lang. They'll have a<br />portable decoder here
3929512 3930513 in two hours.
3930680 3932640 - My wife doesn't have two<br />hours.
3932682 3934642 - I was put on Grant's<br />team yesterday.
3934684 3936978 The regular guy got<br />appendicitis.
3937645 3941024 Word is, nobody's better<br />at this than Major Grant.
3941066 3943276 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3944903 3947864 I wanna hear about the plane<br />those bastards asked for.
3947906 3950158 Then I'll fill you in on my<br />orders.
3950200 3951618 Pilots' briefing room -<br />now!
3951659 3954704 - Keep working.<br />- Albertson. With me!
3959459 3961127 No civilians.
3972013 3974808 - What the fuck...<br />- What is it?
3976059 3979813 The outer marker beeper isn't<br />beeping. It's talking.
3980605 3982941 <i>All aircraft in Dulles landing<br />pattern.</i>

3985360 3988571 I have been authorised to brief<br />you in full.
3988613 3992033 At this time, this is the only<br />channel available to us.
3993159 3997205 Here is the situation.<br />Approximately two hours ago...
4001042 4004170 <i>- Get a load of this. -<br />..claiming to be from our tower</i>
4004212 4007716 <i>unless you hear your flight<br />recorder access code.</i>
4007757 4010635 <i>- The terrorists have got all...<br />- Holy shit! Get this on tape.</i>
4010677 4013471 <i>..control of everything except<br />this channel.</i>
4013513 4015890 Give us a second here, please.
4018018 4021396 <i>Do not attempt to reply on your</i>

4023898 4026067 <i>They have already caused one<br />crash</i>
4026109 4029029 <i>- by impersonating our tower.<br />- Jesus.</i>
4039372 4042292 <i>Repeat. The terrorists have cut<br />off the two systems</i>
4042334 4043960 <i>that allow<br />you to land,</i>
4044002 4046212 <i>field lights for a visual<br />landing</i>
4046254 4048465 <i>and the ILS for an<br />instrument.</i>
4048506 4050925 <i>A Special US army unit is here,</i>
4050967 4053053 <i>preparing to take out the<br />terrorists.</i>
4053094 4054554 My God.
4056222 4058433 - Hey, you interested in a nice<br />coat?
4058475 4060685 - It never looked good on<br />me anyway.
4060727 4063897 You gotta get me up<br />to the pilots' briefing room.
4063938 4065899 I gotta hear what they're<br />saying.
4065940 4067442 Which map gets me in<br />there?
4067484 4069402 - Don't touch it.<br />- Find the map.
4069444 4072864 I'll find it. You'll mess up<br />my whole damn filing system.
4072906 4076117 Pilots' briefing room, I think<br />that's in the main terminal.
4076159 4079662 So would that be under P<br />for "pilots' briefing room"?
4079704 4080872 - Now, Marvin!
4080914 4084042 - Or maybe under M<br />for "miscellaneous".
4088922 4091633 <i>Request permission to reduce<br />sentry duty</i>
4091675 4093009 <i>to 30-minute<br />rotation.</i>
4093051 4095053 <i>My men are getting cold and<br />antsy. Over.</i>
4095095 4098056 <i>This is Colonel Stuart. Have the<br />men not on watch</i>
4098098 4099599 <i>assemble for a<br />briefing. Over.</i>
4099641 4100809 <i>Roger, Colonel. Over and out.</i>
4100850 4102519 What's the matter?
4105105 4108191 Gentlemen, tonight the pattern<br />ends.
4109693 4111861 The dominoes will fall no more
4111903 4114114 and the ramparts will remain<br />upright.
4114155 4117534 Sir, General Esperanza's plane<br />just came on the scope.
4124124 4127877 Attention, Dulles tower.<br />We will be lighting up a runway.
4127919 4131673 <i>Do not, repeat, do not attempt<br />to land any planes.</i>
4131715 4134259 Remember, we're monitoring you.
4137303 4140724 - What do we do?<br />- Obey.
4147230 4150233 Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael<br />One.
4152360 4156156 This is Foxtrot Michael One,<br />Dulles. We read you. Over.
4156197 4161202 Foxtrot Michael One, you are<br />to come in on runway 1-5.
4175550 4179596 I found it on the floor, by the<br />coat, next to the luggage belt.
4179637 4182140 What the hell you so excited<br />for?
4182182 4184392 - The code's still punched into<br />this one.
4184434 4185518 - You like it.
4185560 4188646 How about you give me 20 bucks<br />for it?
4188688 4193318 - How about I let you live?<br />- The man knows how to bargain.
4193985 4196196 This is contrary to our<br />instructions.
4196237 4198782 We are to land at runway 1-0,
4198823 4201576 where we are to be met by
4201618 4203203 representatives of your<br />Justice...
4203244 4207624 Captain, please tell the tower<br />you will proceed as ordered.
4218593 4223390 Roger, Dulles. Proceeding to<br />runway 1-5.
4239823 4242409 Foxtrot Michael One. Come in,<br />please.
4242659 4245912 What are you gonna do now?<br />Are you gonna shoot me?
4245954 4247330 So who will fly the plane?
4247372 4250458 Don't worry about it. It's not<br />your problem.
4257132 4258508 Michael One. Do you copy?
4263346 4265598 Foxtrot Michael One, come in.
4274816 4277277 Eagle Nest. This is Falcon.<br />Mayday.
4282365 4283950 Go ahead, Falcon.
4283992 4287162 I've lost cabin pressure.<br />Near-zero visibility.
4287662 4290749 I must drop out of this weather<br />and land now,
4290790 4292334 on the first<br />accessible runway.
4292375 4296796 <i>Repeat. I've lost cabin<br />pressure. Near-zero visibility.</i>
4296838 4298631 <i>I must drop out of the storm.</i>
4298673 4302927 <i>I can land, but I must land now,<br />on the first outgoing runway.</i>
4303345 4306556 <i>Repeat. I cannot circle around<br />to runway 1-5.</i>
4311144 4313146 I'll make you a deal.
4313188 4315148 Show me out to those runways and
4315190 4316232 I'll get you a liner for that<br />coat.
4316274 4319736 Repeat. I cannot circle around<br />to runway 1-5.
4319778 4321154 Shit!
4321196 4322781 Stand by, Falcon.
4324574 4326701 He's coming in from the ocean,<br />sir.
4329204 4331581 <i>A bullet damaged my instruments.</i>
4331623 4333750 I'm not sure of my bearings and
4333792 4335960 <i>I must make a visual landing<br />immediately.</i>
4336002 4338713 <i>- Do you copy, Eagle Nest?<br />- Roger, Falcon.</i>
4338755 4341174 <i>That would be 2-5 right.</i>
4343551 4345387 Make up your fucking mind.
4346471 4349307 We are just up to our ass<br />in terrorists again, John.
4349349 4351226 2-5 left.
4351810 4353311 2-5 right.
4354771 4357399 I gotta quit smoking cigarettes.
4357440 4360026 Thank you for telling me, Eagle<br />Nest.
4360068 4363738 But if you could show it to me<br />as well, I would be grateful.
4374624 4378169 <i>I see the lights. They are<br />directly in front of me.</i>
4379295 4382382 <i>Reducing airspeed. Approaching<br />runway.</i>
4382424 4384884 <i>- Wish me luck.<br />- Roger, Falcon.</i>
4387178 4389472 We copy. We'll have you in five<br />minutes.
4389514 4392934 That's right, asshole.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4416458 4419669 <i>I see your lights. ETA 90<br />seconds.</i>
4428803 4430930 Come to papa, scumbag.
4486736 4488029 Shit!
4548506 4549674 Freedom.
4550800 4552302 Not yet.
4554137 4556097 You should stay in your seat
4556139 4557515 until the plane reaches the<br />terminal.
4557557 4559893 No frequent-flier mileage for<br />you.
4559934 4562103 - Who are you?<br />- A cop.
4562145 4564272 - A cop?<br />- Yeah, one of the good guys.
4564314 4567609 And you're a bad guy. Now I've<br />got your sorry ass,
4567650 4570653 I'm gonna<br />trade it for my wife.
4577994 4579537 Sit down!
4590423 4592717 - Where'd he go?<br />- In there.
4602143 4603478 I don't believe this.
4603520 4605480 Two months of planning,
4605522 4607148 and you can't anticipate<br />one pendejo of a cop.
4607190 4610235 - Come on, General.<br />- Where is Colonel Stuart?
4613863 4616282 - General!<br />- I'm all right.
4616324 4618284 He said he was a policeman.
4618326 4620120 I thought you had<br />this place secured.
4620161 4623331 - He went in the cockpit.<br />- He's going to hell.
4626626 4628586 I assume it's you, McClane.
4629504 4632090 You're quite a little soldier.
4632132 4634884 You can consider this a military<br />funeral!
4660368 4663079 - How many grenades we got?<br />- Three each!
4663413 4664581 Use 'em!
4675383 4676801 Fuck.
4690648 4691983 Go!
4719636 4721513 You lucky fuck.
4724557 4727852 - Fire trucks, sir.<br />- Fall back to the church. Now!
4750792 4752711 Where's the fuckin' door?
4767684 4771354 They're getting a little nervous<br />back there. In fact, so am I.
4771396 4773356 We're over Washington.
4773398 4775483 See if you can get any<br />TV to settle 'em down.
4775525 4777402 Works for me. I'll...
4801051 4805138 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the video sleaze awards?
4805180 4807932 - Try Pulitzer.<br /><i>- While waiting to land,</i>
4807974 4810602 <i>we are turning on local<br />Washington TV.</i>
4810643 4812103 <i>The sound is on<br />channel three.</i>
4831414 4833750 Please, sir, we may land at any<br />moment.
4833792 4835251 If you'll take your<br />seat...
4835293 4836836 - I'm gonna be sick.
4836878 4840882 - Sir, the seat-belt<br />light is on.
4843968 4845053 Moron.
4845095 4847555 <i>- WZDC.<br />- This is Richard Thornberg.</i>
4847597 4850308 - Put me through to Ruben.<br /><i>- He's about to go live.</i>
4850350 4852477 - I know he is. That's why I<br />need him.
4852519 4853812 <i>- You'll have to hold<br />on...</i>
4853853 4857315 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your résumé.
4858233 4862070 Esperanza's down... but he's<br />hurt.
4863446 4865407 He took a round in his shoulder.
4865448 4867867 I got one more of their guys.<br />That's six they lost.
4867909 4871204 If we knew how many they had,<br />we could get excited,
4871246 4873206 but if they got 50 guys,
4873248 4875041 it's a little early to<br />open the champagne.
4875083 4877043 We appreciate your effort,
4877085 4878795 but we don't need a<br />loose cannon here.
4878837 4882257 What if they crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your stunt?
4882298 4884926 They can't do that now, right,<br />Barnes?
4884968 4887929 And if I'd grabbed Esperanza,<br />this'd be over now.
4887971 4890515 Maybe they're more creative<br />than you think.
4890557 4892934 At least I'm thinking, goddamn<br />it.
4893810 4895770 We're here to jerk off that<br />cocksucker
4895812 4897731 until he tries to<br />take off. Period!
4897772 4901401 You're the wrong guy in the<br />wrong place at the wrong time.
4903445 4905238 The story of my life.
4906489 4909451 Major. Pentagon situation room,<br />sir.
4909492 4912996 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.<br />Thank you, Telford.
4913038 4914914 You men come with me.
4917500 4919377 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4919419 4921129 You said those guys<br />showed up right away?
4921171 4922172 Yeah.
4922213 4925675 So that must mean they're<br />on the field or close.
4925717 4929512 I think I know where. Come here,<br />let me show you something.
4931931 4935060 These are the old plans with the<br />longer runways.
4935101 4936519 That's 12 years<br />ago.
4936561 4940982 Looks like they've modified the<br />site, moved Tra-Con phones, ILS,
4941024 4944319 all the underground stuff,<br />so they could handle drainage.
4944361 4947781 If I'm right, all of it would<br />run along the airport property
4947822 4950533 and go right past this<br />neighbourhood.
4961419 4965048 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess.
4965840 4967801 Unfortunately, there isn't<br />anyone
4967842 4968968 we can blame for the<br />weather.
4969010 4971971 Yeah? What about that porker,<br />Willard Scott?
4972597 4974557 I should have taken the bus.
4974599 4977102 At least they can pull<br />over for food and gas.
4977143 4979521 - Excuse me.<br />- Yes?
4980855 4984484 I was just wondering. This<br />flight originally was supposed
4984526 4987404 to be<br />five and a half hours.
4987445 4990365 Do we have enough fuel to keep<br />circling?
4990407 4993910 Of course. They anticipate<br />little problems like this.
5012095 5015056 We looked at 12 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
5015098 5017225 This is our last possibility.
5018018 5021021 - Over here there's an old<br />church.
5023440 5025775 - Let's go.
5025817 5027068 Wait.
5034409 5036828 There's the church over there.
5044627 5046588 - Could be a sentry.
5046629 5048089 - He could just be<br />out for a walk.
5048131 5051092 Then why is he going over<br />his own footsteps?
5053386 5054763 Come on.
5056765 5060435 All right. Just stay here and<br />get ready to call the marines.
5060477 5061811 - I thought they were the army.
5061853 5063605 - Who gives a fuck? Just be<br />ready.
5081331 5085085 Shit. Not now.
5099474 5101559 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5101601 5103812 <i>Where the hell are you? Where's<br />McClane?</i>
5103853 5105814 With me, at the community<br />church,
5105855 5107190 to the west of the<br />airport.
5107232 5110193 Where? Goddamn it.<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't...
5110235 5112195 This must be their operations<br />base.
5112237 5113822 <i>Shut up and get your ass<br />here!</i>
5113863 5115573 Code red. Sit rep.
5116116 5119452 We got positive ID on Stuart's<br />location. Let's move.
5131506 5135176 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
5136511 5139014 If there are no more surprises.
5153278 5156239 Gentlemen, we have a situation<br />here.
5233608 5235443 They're over here.
5247872 5250166 Jeez, you all right? You want a<br />medic?
5250208 5253670 What the hell you think you're<br />doin'? Playing John Wayne?
5253712 5255797 How'd you like to spend the<br />night in a cell?
5255839 5258299 Shut the fuck up and do<br />something useful.
5258341 5259551 Seal off the<br />street.
5259592 5261678 - Hey, you can't talk to me like<br />that.
5261720 5263221 - No, Carmine?
5263263 5267100 Sergeant, get this bureaucrat<br />out of Mr McClane's face - now!
5267142 5269102 With pleasure, sir.
5271271 5274607 Major, the men are in position,<br />sir.
5274649 5277736 Close up the back, then we go<br />in. Fire only on my order.
5277777 5279237 Roger that, sir.
5279279 5281448 Guess I was wrong about you.
5281489 5284034 You're not such an asshole<br />after all.
5284075 5287328 No, you were right.<br />I'm just your kind of asshole.
5296379 5298882 Garber, sit rep!
5298923 5302302 Army Special Forces<br />on three sides, closing in fast!
5302344 5305305 - Another problem, Colonel?<br />- No problem, General.
5306056 5308350 Gentlemen, you know what to do.
5319778 5321696 - Down!<br />- Get down!
5350517 5353228 General... it's time.
5360276 5362445 Come on, let's move it.
5377043 5382048 - They're pulling out... at the<br />back.
5388138 5389431 Move it!
5399399 5401860 Albertson, your men around the<br />back.
5427635 5430055 This equipment could land our<br />planes.
5430096 5432849 Don't touch anything.<br />If it's booby-trapped...
5432891 5433892 It is.
5433933 5437270 Got one here. Looks like C-4.<br />The motherfucker is armed.
5437312 5439564 Clear the area. Everybody, now!
5443276 5445945 They booby-trapped the<br />equipment. Seal it off.
5445987 5447280 Shit!
5451034 5452744 Where the fuck is McClane?
5502419 5504212 Miller, take him.
5505630 5507424 I'll cover you.
5553970 5556639 So much for the element of<br />chance.
5557640 5559267 Let's move out.
5576451 5579454 I had the bastard in my sights.<br />I know I did.
5590298 5592300 Jesus Christ.
5598014 5599724 <i>Attention, Dulles tower.</i>
5599766 5602644 <i>This is Colonel Stuart.<br />Is our plane prepared?</i>
5602686 5604979 It is. It's in hangar 11.
5605021 5607774 It's the most remote<br />building we've got.
5607816 5610985 We're on our way. Have a ground<br />crew there
5611027 5613530 to confirm the<br />condition of the plane.
5613571 5616533 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5616574 5619661 Colonel, you're capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5619703 5623039 <i>Don't ask us to gift-wrap<br />potential hostages for you.</i>
5623081 5626584 - Major Grant, isn't it?<br /><i>- If you remember me, Colonel,</i>
5626626 5629671 <i>then you remember I know the<br />drill as well as you do.</i>
5630422 5632757 Check out your own fuckin'<br />plane.
5632799 5636886 We move out in five minutes.<br />Flak jackets for everybody.
5636928 5639222 Body armour for the assault<br />team.
5639264 5641182 Night scopes for the<br />snipers.
5641224 5642559 We go to the hangar.
5642600 5646146 I will pull that detonator out<br />of Stuart's
5646187 5647939 dead fuckin' hand<br />myself.
5647981 5650525 Lorenzo, take all your men back<br />to the airport.
5650567 5654112 Seal off every exit in case<br />they try to slip past us
5654154 5655905 to break out onto the ground.
5655947 5657449 You got it.
5659492 5661411 All right, here we go.
5662287 5664706 This is nuts! Every station has<br />people at the airport.
5664748 5666791 <i>No one has heard a whisper of<br />this!</i>
5666833 5670462 None of them is me.<br />You want proof, try this.
5670754 5673673 <i>Terrorists have murdered<br />civilians</i>
5673715 5676760 <i>and cut off the two systems<br />that allow you to land.</i>
5676801 5678845 <i>A Special US army unit is here,</i>
5678887 5680638 <i>preparing to take out the<br />terrorists.</i>
5680680 5683308 - Jesus Christ.<br /><i>- I want you to go live now.</i>
5683350 5685727 Key me in from the files, a<br />publicity shot.
5685769 5687103 Steal a map from<br />weather.
5687145 5690231 We're on it. We're cutting in<br />five minutes.
5690273 5692484 Tell the affiliates, if they<br />want in,
5692525 5695445 they got three minutes<br />to shout. Let's do this.
5695487 5697072 Network, here I come.
5700408 5704245 Telford, what was your<br />chickenshit outfit doing
5704287 5707040 while<br />we were taking Grenada?
5707082 5710126 Grenada. Five minutes of<br />firefight,
5710168 5712629 five weeks of<br />surfing.
5712671 5715632 - I wish I was with you guys for<br />that.
5715674 5717175 - Yeah. Me too, kid.
5717217 5719344 - Really, sir?<br />- Sure.
5720720 5723348 Then we wouldn't have to do<br />this.
5738071 5740448 Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.
5741449 5744411 On schedule... and in position.
5744452 5746788 Roger, Hatchling. We are secure<br />here.
5746830 5751251 <i>You have a green light.</i>
5762762 5766558 Jesus, officer, where'd<br />you come from, Pearl Harbor?
5771730 5773940 Let's clear it out, please.
5777694 5779779 Five, four, three...
5780905 5783783 <i>This is a special bulletin<br />from WZDC News.</i>
5783825 5786578 <i>There has been a plane crash at<br />Dulles,</i>
5786619 5788329 <i>where other aircraft<br />still circle,</i>
5788371 5791791 <i>with no explanation<br />from airport or FAA officials.</i>
5791833 5794878 <i>And now, with an exclusive WZDC<br />report,</i>
5794919 5798631 <i>here's Dick Thornberg reporting<br />from the skies over Washington.</i>
5798673 5801926 <i>I'm one of the people circling<br />our capital</i>
5801968 5803845 <i>under the assumption<br />that whatever problem</i>
5803887 5806848 <i>there was below was a normal<br />one.</i>
5807223 5810894 <i>But the truth is far from<br />normal. The truth is terrifying.</i>
5819527 5821738 Get out of the way, lady!
5823948 5825992 This is a recording of a<br />conversation
5826034 5829704 between Dulles tower<br />and a captive aircraft overhead.
5835669 5837420 - Lorenzo!
5837462 5838463 - Are you out of<br />your fuckin' mind?
5838505 5840465 - Where's the Blue Light team?
5840507 5842342 - Stuart's rigged<br />explosives to a remote.
5842384 5843510 Where's Grant?
5843551 5845845 His boys are gonna kill that son<br />of a bitch.
5845887 5847972 - No, they're gonna take off<br />with him.
5848014 5849599 - Get the fuck outta<br />here.
5849641 5852727 When the army canned Stuart,<br />he put his men in that unit.
5852769 5854729 - Are you nuts? That<br />firefight...
5854771 5856773 - Sideshow to buy<br />him some time.
5856815 5859401 You are completely<br />around the fuckin' bend.
5859442 5861945 You're under arrest,<br />motherfucker.
5868993 5872789 These are the bullets they<br />used out there tonight. Blanks!
5875250 5876918 Jesus Christ.
5885010 5888430 This is Chief Lorenzo.<br />I want every officer recalled
5888471 5891599 and in body armour and full<br />weaponry
5891641 5894769 in the motor pool in<br />five minutes.
5894811 5896896 It's time to kick ass.
5899107 5901443 Just like Iwo Jima.
5901484 5904612 <i>We have learned that the<br />terrorists</i>
5904654 5907282 <i>have control of the<br />airport,</i>
5907323 5910243 <i>a fact that the authorities have<br />repressed.</i>
5910285 5912120 <i>The terrorists promise more<br />bloodshed</i>
5912162 5913830 <i>unless their demands<br />are met.</i>
5914330 5916291 Now that the Special army<br />commandos
5916332 5917917 have arrived at the<br />airport,
5917959 5922297 the likelihood of a full-scale<br />battle is dangerously close.
5943943 5947197 That stupid, arrogant son of a<br />bitch.
5947238 5949616 It's all over the<br />airport.
5949657 5951576 <i>300 people have died</i>
5954079 5956998 <i>and, unfortunately,<br />they may not be the last.</i>
5957040 5960210 <i>The horrifying fact is that<br />no one is safe,</i>
5960251 5964047 <i>either in the planes above<br />Dulles or in the terminal below.</i>
5964089 5967801 <i>The threat of a higher body<br />count at the airport hangs over</i>
5967842 5969052 <i>the heads of everyone,</i>
5969094 5973098 <i>and the holiday season of peace<br />and love has become a nightmare.</i>
5979938 5981898 Listen up, all units.
5981940 5985735 I want you to converge on<br />hangar 11, all sides.
5985777 5987904 This car, McClane. Get in!
5987946 5990615 When the city blue show up<br />with their backup,
5990657 5993952 they'll pick up the pieces. Move<br />out!
5994953 5998790 - McClane, say hi to my brother<br />Vito.
5998832 6000250 - Merry Christmas.
6000291 6001793 Hi.
6007382 6011594 Goddamn it to hell!<br />Move that piece of shit.
6013138 6016016 Will you move that goddamn<br />piece of shit out of here?
6016057 6017642 Vito, get the fuck out of the<br />car and
6017684 6019686 get your ass in gear and<br />help me!
6025775 6028111 Hey, Coleman!
6032991 6034909 - Hey, Coleman!<br />- Hi.
6038038 6041916 ..but at least the truth<br />is not among the hostages
6041958 6046171 because I, Richard Thornberg,<br />just happened to be here
6047130 6051509 to put his life and talent on<br />the line
6051551 6053511 for humanity and<br />country.
6053553 6056264 If this should be my final<br />broadcast...
6058516 6060977 Amen to that, Dick.
6062103 6066066 <i>Dick? We're live, Dick.<br />Where are you now?</i>
6070195 6074157 Truck lights approaching, sir.<br />They're here, right on schedule.
6074699 6076826 The hangar door, open it.
6077118 6078578 Clockwork.
6102018 6105397 Jeez, you give me this story,<br />and I'll have your baby.
6105980 6108066 Not the kind of ride I'm looking<br />for.
6119869 6123039 Colonel, if I may say so,<br />you are some piece of work.
6123081 6126167 Thank you, Major. You're not<br />so bad yourself.
6126584 6128586 - Congratulations on your<br />escape, sir.
6128628 6129963 - Thank you, Major.
6130005 6131214 You should save them<br />until we are all safe.
6131256 6133049 Sir.
6133091 6135051 My congratulations, gentlemen.
6135093 6137512 You've won a victory for our<br />way of life,
6137554 6141474 my pride, my admiration,<br />and a kick-ass vacation.
6141516 6143184 Now, get on board.
6173757 6176301 - Ride too rough, cowboy?<br />- I don't like to fly.
6176343 6178803 - So why are you here?<br />- I don't like to lose.
6191107 6193068 I don't know about you,
6193109 6194986 but I've seen enough snow<br />to last me a lifetime.
6195028 6199366 - You don't get much of that in<br />the tropics.
6199407 6202452 - For you<br />gentlemen, we'll import it.
6202494 6204704 Shit. They left the hangar.
6208249 6210043 Right there. Get that.
6210085 6212170 - Now what?<br />- Get in front.
6212212 6214381 Block their path so they can't<br />get out.
6214422 6216549 I'm not playing chicken<br />with a 200-ton plane!
6216591 6218677 I'm crazy, but not that crazy.
6218718 6222722 <i>- Dulles, this is Northeast 140.<br />- That's Holly's plane.</i>
6222764 6225183 <i>Request emergency clearance.</i>
6225225 6228269 <i>I know you won't answer<br />but you better listen.</i>
6228311 6230980 We're down to fumes and we have<br />to land.
6231022 6232816 In five minutes, we're<br />coming in.
6232857 6235527 That's my wife's plane.<br />Take it fuckin' down!
6235568 6238279 I'm not getting in front of that<br />plane.
6242659 6244494 How about gettin' over top of<br />it?
6244869 6247455 This is the captain. Your<br />attention.
6247497 6250959 We have no choice but to attempt<br />an emergency landing.
6251001 6254170 Fasten your seat belts<br />and assume crash positions,
6254212 6256381 - as instructed by your cabin<br />attendants.
6256423 6258591 - Let's have the<br />emergency check list.
6258633 6261219 Attention, all air traffic in<br />Dulles area.
6261261 6262721 This is Northeast<br />140.
6262762 6265265 We are attempting an emergency<br />landing.
6270270 6272147 I don't wanna die.
6273231 6274524 I'm sorry.
6278194 6279571 God!
6289372 6291875 Thy rod and thy staff they<br />comfort me.
6298715 6301217 - Hang on!<br />- What are you doing?
6301259 6305263 You wanted a story. Nice and<br />easy, boys. Get me in low.
6310226 6313688 - Bring me down.<br />- You'll get yourself killed.
6321196 6323907 Bring it in low. Keep over the<br />wing.
6331664 6333124 Lower.
6342801 6344678 John, what the fuck are you<br />doin'
6344719 6346221 out on the wing of this<br />plane?
6354145 6355355 Damn!
6362362 6364364 There's something wrong.
6364739 6367409 The ailerons. We can't take off.
6373373 6375333 It's McClane again.
6375917 6377502 Son of a bitch!
6379170 6382549 - I'll do him.<br />- This time, do it right.
6382590 6384551 Just get us in the air, General.
6384592 6385885 You're the only man who can do<br />it.
6385927 6388722 Don't shoot. That wing is fully<br />fuelled.
6440774 6443777 Too bad, McClane. I kinda liked<br />you.
6451534 6453370 I got enough friends.
6491825 6493785 Time for the main event.
6529112 6531531 You motherfucker!
6543626 6545420 How's it goin'?
6556723 6558767 Happy landings, asshole!
6610568 6612821 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
6664247 6665915 Holly!
6666499 6668918 Here's your fuckin' landing<br />light.
6681306 6684768 Look! I see it.
6710335 6713296 They used the fuckin' fire to<br />see.
6713338 6715757 They can all do that. Let's tell<br />'em.
6715799 6719469 They already know. Listen.
6719511 6721513 <i>They're using the fire trail as<br />a guide.</i>
6721554 6722972 <i>If they can do it, so<br />can we.</i>
6741741 6745120 Any landing you can walk<br />away from is a good one.
6816316 6818735 Holly!
6854771 6856481 Hi!
6866408 6869494 Oh, God. Oh, baby.
6869536 6871871 I thought I was never gonna see<br />you again.
6871913 6874040 That's what I thought about you.
6874082 6876001 I love you so much.
6879838 6882924 They told me there were<br />terrorists at the airport.
6882966 6884926 Yeah. I heard that, too.
6893601 6895520 God, that's beautiful.
6898732 6900817 Yup. It sure is.
6903069 6905030 I love you so much.
6907323 6911828 John, why does this keep<br />happening to us?
6917917 6919794 Let's go home.
6924549 6926760 Somebody help me, please.
6926801 6929262 Honey, help me up here, please.
6929304 6930764 Asshole!
6933767 6936102 Hey, officer, come on!
6938229 6941191 Hop on in here. Get your missus<br />in.
6941232 6943193 What do you say, Marv?
6943234 6946654 I'll be damned if<br />I'm gonna clean up this mess.
6956873 6960126 You get this parking ticket<br />in front of my airport?
6961002 6962545 Yeah.
6963588 6967008 What the hell. It's Christmas.
6971971 6973848 Take off, Marv!
