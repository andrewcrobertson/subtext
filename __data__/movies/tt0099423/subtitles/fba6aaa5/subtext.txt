1255171 1258632 Not now! Later!<br />I got international diplomats.
1258716 1263095 I got a fuckin' reindeer flying in here<br />from the fuckin' petting zoo!
1263179 1266056 But John McClane—<br />he's got a little problem.
1266140 1268392 Hell, let's shut down<br />the whole fuckin' airport!
1268476 1270978 What do you think they're gonna say upstairs<br />when I tell them that?
1271061 1272980 Why don't you pick up<br />the phone and find out?
1273063 1275775 Because I don't need<br />full fuckin' forensics to tell me...
1275858 1278027 all this was, was some punk<br />stealin' luggage!
1278110 1281530 Luggage? That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.<br />You know what that is?
1281614 1285493 It's a porcelain gun made in Germany.<br />It doesn't show up on your airport X-ray machines...
1285576 1287620 and it costs more than<br />you make in a month.
1287703 1289747 You'd be surprised<br />what I make in a month.
1289830 1292875 - If it's more than $1.98, I'd be very surprised.<br />- Hey, McClane...
1292958 1294960 don't start believin'<br />your own press, huh?
1295044 1298506 Yeah, yeah, I know all about<br />you and that Nakatomi thing in L.A.

3385090 3388010 Looking good, Windsor.<br />Now watch it.
3388093 3391013 30-knot crosswinds,<br />and the runway is icy.
3391096 3393015 Attaboy. We've got you.
3394308 3398353 - We've got you.<br />- [ Beeping ]
3407029 3410115 No! Pull up!

3471635 3473553 [Man]<br />Oh, Jesus.
3485315 3488151 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3488235 3491196 If the 747 we requested<br />is ready on time...
3491279 3494032 and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested...
3494116 3496618 further lessons can be avoided.
3496702 3498620 Out.

3508755 3511675 [ Sirens Wailing ]
3522269 3524354 Come on, you guys!
3530068 3531987 Hurry! Hurry!
3532070 3534197 We need<br />a truck over there!
3539536 3541538 [ Men Shouting ]
3544374 3548128 We got no sign of survivors down here!<br />It's a goddamn nightmare!
3549671 3552340 Hey, Nelson!
3552424 3554426 [ Crowd Shouting ]
3562309 3564644 Barnes!
3564728 3568607 We've gotta warn those planes there's a lunatic<br />down here who likes to pretend he's the tower.
3568690 3571193 - Get up to the cabin. Get me on the air.<br />- How?
3571276 3574154 - You figure it out!<br />- Here's the manifest.
3578450 3580660 [ Chattering ]
3595175 3597594 McClane, I know<br />how you must feel.
3602099 3605185 I wanted to help<br />those people tonight.
3606561 3609856 I was pretty<br />goddamn useless.
3612567 3614986 We called<br />the government for help.
3615070 3618907 They're gonna send in<br />a special army unit...
3618990 3621201 a counterterrorist team.
3628041 3632337 Your wife's plane?<br />Well, they're still broadcasting...
3632420 3635715 even though<br />we can't answer.
3636925 3639886 They're gonna<br />run out of fuel in 90 minutes.
3648395 3650355 [ Gasps I]
3651565 3655819 Listen, Dick.<br />That is your name— Dick.
3655902 3658864 If you're going to continue<br />to get this close...
3658947 3662492 do you think you might consider<br />switching aftershaves?
3662576 3664786 Anything else?
3664870 3667914 Stronger mouthwash<br />might be nice.
3667998 3670500 [Man On Radio ] And here's Sam Coleman<br />reporting live from the site—
3670584 3672544 Well, Colonel...
3672627 3675505 they've done everything<br />we've anticipated... so far.
3675589 3678425 But still there has been<br />no official word from authorities.
3678508 3682929 Meanwhile, despite the fact that only one<br />runway has been closed due to the tragedy...
3683013 3687309 several dozen airliners are visible from where<br />I stand, endlessly circling the field.
3687392 3689936 Other reports say that<br />there was trouble in the tower...
3690020 3693315 before the crash and that that<br />may have even contributed to it.
3693398 3695984 One thing is certain—<br />With weather conditions worsening...
3696067 3699487 the problem here and in the sky above us<br />will continue to grow.
3699571 3702908 I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles<br />International Airport.
3703074 3704951 [ Chattering ]
3709998 3712834 - Victor. Victor. Victor.<br />- Yeah, what's up?
3712918 3714836 Did you pack the radio<br />mikes from the shoot...
3714920 3717380 - or did you put them in your carry-on?<br />- Are you crazy?
3717464 3720008 - I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em in.<br />- I love you.
3720091 3722636 Give me one of the receivers.
3726097 3731019 - Can you tune in to the cockpit frequency?<br />- Yeah. Why?
3731102 3733104 I wanna hear what's goin' on.
3734898 3737317 - Should be right here on our band.<br />- [ Static]
3737400 3741404 - Nothing.<br />- You just told me it would work.<br />Is it working or not?
3741488 3746034 It is working, but it's—<br />All I'm getting is some kind of airport beacon.
3746117 3749913 It's weird. It's like<br />the tower isn't there.
3752123 3754417 Stay on it.
3754501 3756544 Let me know when<br />there is something there.
3756628 3758838 Okay.
3787993 3790704 [ Men Shouting ]
3796167 3799004 - Major Grant. We're Blue Light.<br />- Rollins, Department of Justice.
3799087 3801006 Trudeau, chief of air operations.
3801089 3803341 Lorenzo, terminal police.
3803425 3805343 You want something, you got it.
3805427 3808471 This is it?<br />One fucking platoon?
3808555 3812100 - One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?<br />- John McClane.
3812183 3816062 - McClane, you showed some balls out there, man.<br />- Yeah.
3816146 3820233 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3820317 3822861 Well, it looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3822944 3824863 Isn't Colonel Stuart<br />one of your men?
3824946 3828700 No, not anymore he's not.<br />Now we're here to take Colonel Stuart down.
3828783 3831036 And we will take him down.
3831119 3834331 You see, I served with him.<br />I taught him everything he knows.
3834414 3838209 Well, maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3838293 3840712 Let's hustle!
3840795 3844007 Command post will be set up<br />in the airport police station.
3844090 3847010 I want to be tied in to the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3847093 3849095 Allright, let's do it!
3850221 3852223 Hey, Trudeau.
3854517 3856519 Things just get<br />better or worse?
3860523 3862442 Lights— big, portable lights.
3862525 3866237 - We set up the field, and then—<br />- We wait for those lunatics to shoot 'em out?
3866321 3868948 And where do we get those big, portable lights—<br />borrow them from Batman?
3869032 3870950 What about the air phone idea?
3871034 3873870 There's 18 planes up there.<br />Only five of them have those phones.
3873953 3876331 We got through to three.<br />We're still trying on the others.
3876414 3879167 That leaves 13 accidents waiting to happen.<br />Are they still bucking headwinds?
3879250 3882337 I just checked the weather. Headwinds are<br />slamming everybody over the outer marker.
3882420 3884631 The planes with enough fuel<br />have already been...
3884714 3886299 shunted to Atlanta,<br />Memphis and Nashville.
3886466 3888927 Outer marker.
3889010 3892847 Damn!<br />The outer marker!
3892931 3895350 It's a beacon, right?<br />A radio beacon that sends out...
3895433 3897685 this “beep, beep, beep”<br />so they know they're over it, right?
3897769 3901147 - 50?<br />- So who says that radio signal has to just beep?
3901231 3904984 Right. We switch the frequency<br />from the tower over to the one in the beacon.
3905068 3907821 - We pump up the wattage.<br />- And we can talk to our planes...
3907904 3909989 and those bastards<br />who did this will never know!
3912534 3915537 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3915620 3918289 They've been tapped<br />into your tower chatter all night.
3918373 3920417 Punks stealin' luggage,<br />huh, Carmine?
3924045 3926464 - How you doing, Telford?<br />- No good.
3926548 3928967 I called Langley.<br />They're rigging a portable decoder.
3929050 3931970 - It'll be here in two hours.<br />- My wife doesn't have two hours.
3932053 3934472 I was only transferred<br />to Grant's team yesterday.
3934556 3936474 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3936558 3940812 - Word is, nobody's better at this than Major Grant.<br />- [Man ] Attention!
3940895 3943523 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3943606 3946776 I want to hear about the plane<br />those bastards asked for.
3946860 3949988 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.<br />Pilots' briefing room. Now.
3950071 3951990 - Keep working.<br />- Albertson!
3952073 3954075 - Sir!<br />- With me.
3954159 3956161 Yes, sir!
3958788 3960874 No civilians.
3971468 3973386 What the fuck?
3973470 3975513 What is it?
3975597 3977515 The outer marker beeper.
3977599 3980226 It isn't beeping.<br />It's talking.

3983062 3985148 This is Chief Engineer<br />Leslie Barnes.
3985231 3987984 I have been authorized<br />to brief you in full.
3988067 3992489 At this time, this is the only<br />channel available to us.
3992572 3994991 Here is the situation.
3995074 3997327 Approximately two hours ago—
3999621 4001539 Wait till you get a load of this.
4001623 4004334 [ Barnes ] Do not accept any instructions<br />claiming to be from our tower...
4004417 4007670 unless you hear your own<br />flight recorder access code.
4007754 4010840 - The terrorists have got all our systems...<br />- Holy shit! Get this on tape.
4010924 4012842 and now have control of everything<br />except this channel.
4012926 4014886 Give us a second<br />here, please.
4014969 4017514 [ Barnes ] This channel is secure,<br />but your own transmissions are not.
4017597 4019516 Do not, repeat...
4019599 4023686 do not attempt to reply on your own<br />frequencies to this broadcast.
4023770 4025855 These people have already<br />caused one crash...
4025939 4028107 - by impersonating our tower.<br />- Jesus.
4039118 4041120 [ Barnes ]<br />Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...
4041204 4043957 the two systems that can<br />allow you to land—
4044040 4045959 field lights for a visual landing...
4046042 4047961 and the L.L.S. for an instrument.
4048044 4049963 A special U.S. Army unit<br />is already here...
4050046 4052340 and preparing to take out<br />the terrorists.
4052423 4054759 - My God.<br />- Don't accept any instructions—
4054842 4057470 - Yo, Marvin.<br />- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?
4057554 4060056 No. It never looked<br />good on me anyway. Come here.
4060139 4063309 Listen, you gotta get me up to the pilots'<br />briefing room. They're havin' a little soiree.
4063393 4066771 I gotta hear what they're sayin'<br />even if I gotta put a fuckin' glass to the door.
4066854 4069482 - Which one of these maps gets me in there?<br />- Don't touch it!
4069566 4072860 - Find the map, Marvin.<br />- I'll find it. You'll mess up my<br />whole damn filing system here.
4072944 4075822 Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.<br />I think that's in the main terminal.
4075905 4079701 So would that be under<br />“P” for “pilots' briefing room”?
4079784 4083746 - Now, Marvin.<br />- Or maybe it would be under “M”<br />for “miscellaneous.”
4086833 4088334 [Radio Beeping ]
4088418 4091170 - Oh, shit!<br />- [Man On Radio ] This is Garber.<br />Request permission to reduce...

4175630 4179676 I found it on the floor, by the coat,<br />next to the luggage belt.
4179759 4181678 What the hell you so excited<br />about that for?
4181761 4183721 The code's still punched<br />into this one.
4183805 4187392 You like it, huh?<br />How about you give me 20 bucks for it?
4187475 4189727 How about I let you live?
4191270 4193398 Man knows how to bargain.
4193523 4195858 This is contrary to our instructions.

4590044 4591837 - Where'd he go?<br />- In there.
4601138 4604683 [ Esperanza I<br />I don't believe this. Two months of planning...
4604767 4607103 and you can't anticipate one<br />pendejo ofa cop.
4607186 4609230 - Come on, General.<br />- Where the hell is Colonel Stuart?
4613275 4615486 - General!<br />- lam all right.
4615569 4617613 He said he was a policeman.
4617696 4619615 I thought you had this place secured.
4619698 4621700 He went in the cockpit.
4621784 4624995 He's goin' to hell!<br />McClane!
4626455 4628707 I assume it's you, McClane.
4628791 4631669 You're quite a little soldier.
4631752 4635422 You can consider this<br />a military funeral!
4651021 4653232 [ Screams I
4658445 4660781 How many grenades we got?
4660865 4664201 - [Garber ] Three each!<br />- Use'em!
4673961 4677089 Oh, fuck.
4677173 4679884 Oh! Sh—
4690561 4693147 Go!
4704742 4708245 [ Screaming ]
4708329 4710331 Oh, shit!
4719215 4721175 [Stuart]<br />You lucky fuck.
4721258 4724470 [ Sirens Wailing ]
4724553 4728807 - [Garber ] Fire trucks, sir.<br />- Fall back to the church. Now!
4739109 4743155 [ Sirens Continue I]
4745532 4748535 [ Groans]
4750788 4752831 Where's the fucking door?
4757002 4759380 [ Beeps ]
4766720 4770057 They're getting a little<br />nervous back there. In fact, so am I.
4770140 4772059 We're right over Washington.
4772142 4774561 See if you can get any TV.<br />That'll settle 'em down.
4774645 4777523 Works for me. I'll—
4777606 4780526 [ Beeping ]
4800713 4804133 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the Video Sleaze Awards?
4804216 4807177 - Try Pulitzer.<br />- [Attendant On Speaker ] Ladies and gentlemen...
4807261 4811056 while waiting to land, our cabin attendants<br />are turning on local Washington broadcasting.
4811140 4813058 The sound is on channel three.
4819732 4822401 Okay. Okay. Okay.
4829908 4833579 - [ Beeps]<br />- Please, sir, we may land at any moment.
4833662 4835581 - If you'll take your seat—<br />- I'm gonna be sick.
4835664 4837583 Excuse me. I'm gonna be sick.
4837666 4839752 Sir, the seat belt light is on.
4843714 4845090 Moron.
4845174 4847092 - [Woman On Phone ] WZDC.<br />- Yes, this is Richard Thornberg.
4847176 4849094 Put me through to Ruben in the newsroom.
4849178 4851680 - He's about to go live.<br />- I know he's about to go on.
4851764 4854183 - That's why I need him.<br />- You'll have to hold on—
4854266 4857436 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your résumé.
4857519 4860105 Esperanza's down.
4860189 4864026 But he's hurt.<br />He took a round in his shoulder.
4864109 4866028 Plus I got one more of their guys.
4866111 4868030 That's six they lost altogether.
4868113 4871075 Maybe if we knew how many<br />they had to start with, we could get excited...
4871158 4874870 but if they got 50 guys,<br />it's a little early to break out the champagne!
4874953 4878916 We appreciate your effort, McClane, but we<br />don't need a loose cannon on this deck!
4878999 4882169 What if they decide to crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your little stunt?
4882252 4884671 They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?
4884755 4887549 Besides, if I grabbed<br />Esperanza, this would all be over by now.
4887633 4890302 Well, maybe they're just<br />a little bit more creative than you think!
4890386 4892638 Well, at least<br />I'm thinking, goddamn it!
4892721 4895224 Listen, you wiseass, we're here to jerk off<br />that cocksucker...
4895307 4897434 until he tries to take off— period!
4897518 4900646 Now, you're the wrong guy<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time!
4902231 4905651 [ Sighs ]<br />The story of my life.
4905734 4909196 Major, Pentagon<br />Situation Room, sir!
4909279 4912408 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.<br />Thank you, Telford.
4912491 4915327 You men come with me.
4916745 4918664 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4918747 4922209 - You said those guys showed up<br />out there right away?<br />- Yeah.
4922292 4924711 So— So that must mean<br />they're on the field or close.
4924795 4927214 And I think I know where.
4927297 4929299 Come here. Let me<br />show you something.
4931677 4935681 These are the old plans when the longer<br />runways went in. That's— That's 12 years ago.
4935764 4938851 Looks like they've done<br />some modifications on-site—
4938934 4942229 moved TRACON phones, I.L.S.,<br />all the underground stuff...
4942312 4944231 so they could handle drainage.
4944314 4947734 If I'm right, all of it would run right<br />along the airport property...
4947818 4951029 and go right past<br />this neighborhood.
4953740 4955784 We should have been<br />on the ground two hours ago!
4955868 4957786 I understand,<br />but if you just relax a little—
4957870 4961415 - Come on, lady. Who you tryin' to kid?<br />-[ Man] It's hopeless.
4961498 4965043 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess. That's for sure.
4965127 4968755 Well, unfortunately, there really isn't anyone<br />we can blame for the weather.
4968839 4971758 Oh, yeah? What about<br />that porker Willard Scott?
4971842 4973760 I should have taken the bus.
4973844 4976972 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4977055 4979933 - Excuse me.<br />- Yes?
4980017 4981935 I was just wondering.
4982019 4986315 Um, this flight originally was supposed to be<br />five and a half hours, right?
4986398 4990110 - Mm-hmm.<br />- Do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this?
4990194 4994239 Oh, of course.<br />They anticipate little problems like this.
5011840 5014426 Barnes, we looked at 12 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
5014510 5017346 This is our last possibility.
5017429 5019515 Over here there's an old church.
5019598 5021266 Let's go.
5025854 5027856 Wait.
5034238 5036365 There's the church over there.
5043872 5047751 - Could be a sentry.<br />- And he could just be out for a walk.
5047834 5050295 Then why is he going over<br />his own footsteps?
5052881 5055133 Come on.
5056802 5060138 All right. Just stay here and get<br />ready to call the marines.
5060222 5064560 - I thought they were the army.<br />- Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
5074820 5076822 [ Beeping ]
5080576 5082911 - [Pager Beeping I<br />- Oh, shit.
5082995 5085122 Not now.
5086832 5089626 [ Shouts ]
5091378 5093672 [ Beeping ]
5099303 5101346 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5101430 5103473 Barnes, where the hell did you go?<br />Where's McClane?
5103557 5107019 He's with me. We're at the Highland Lake<br />Community Church on the west side of the airport.
5107102 5110272 You're where? Goddamn it!<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't—
5110355 5113942 This must be their base of operations.<br />Shut up and get your ass over here! Move it!
5114026 5116111 Code red! Sit rep.
5116194 5119156 We got positive I.D.<br />on Stuart's location. Let's move.
5119239 5121241 -Yo!<br />- Yes, sir.
5131543 5134171 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
5136298 5138550 If there are no more surprises.

5250328 5253498 McClane, what the hell you think<br />you're doing out there, playing John Wayne?
5253582 5255834 How would you like<br />to spend the night in a cell?
5255917 5259421 Lorenzo, shut the fuck up and do something<br />useful. Go seal off the street.
5259504 5261590 Hey, you can't<br />talk to me like that.
5261673 5266803 Oh, no, Carmine? Sergeant, get this<br />bureaucrat out of Mr. McClane's face now.
5266887 5268805 With pleasure, sir.
5270515 5274269 Major, the men are in position, sir.
5274352 5276438 Close up the back.<br />Then we go in.
5276521 5278899 - Fire only on my order.<br />- Roger that, sir.
5278982 5280901 Guess I was wrong about you.
5280984 5283487 You're not such<br />an asshole after all.
5283570 5287157 No, you were right.<br />I'm just your kind of asshole.

5302255 5305675 - Another problem, Colonel?<br />- No problem, General.
5305759 5308762 Gentlemen,<br />you know what to do.
5319523 5321858 - [Gunshots I<br />- Down!<br />- Get down! Get down!
5328740 5330242 [ Beeping ]

5359771 5362774 Come on. Let's move it!
5376830 5378915 - They're pulling out!<br />- What?
5378999 5381001 Out the back!
5387924 5389926 Move it!
5399269 5401771 Albertson, take your men<br />around the back.

5414951 5417537 [ Groaning ]
5423835 5425837 [ Chattering ]
5427255 5429925 This equipment—<br />it could land our planes.
5430008 5432719 Don't touch anything. There were trip wires<br />outside. They could have booby-trapped—
5432802 5436473 - They did.<br />- Got one here. Looks like C-4.<br />The motherfucker is armed.
5436556 5439851 Clear the area!<br />Everybody, now!
5442437 5444356 They booby-trapped<br />all the equipment.
5444439 5446358 - Seal off the building!<br />- Shit!
5446441 5449361 Secure the area.<br />Post sentries. No civilians allowed.
5449444 5452906 Hey, where the fuck is McClane?
5501746 5504582 Miller, take him!
5504666 5507794 I'll cover you!

5575904 5577906 I had the bastard<br />in my sights.
5577989 5579991 I know I did.

5596674 5599260 [ Stuart On Speaker]<br />Attention, Tower. Attention, Dulles Tower.
5599344 5601888 This is Colonel Stuart.<br />Is our plane prepared?
5601971 5603890 It is.<br />It's in Hangar 11.
5603973 5606226 It's the most<br />remote building we've got.
5607435 5609354 We're on our way.
5609437 5612899 Have a ground crew there<br />to confirm the condition of the plane.
5612982 5615902 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5615985 5619739 Colonel, you're quite capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5619823 5622826 Now, please, don't ask us<br />to gift wrap potential hostages for you.
5622909 5624828 Major Grant, isn't it?
5624911 5628748 If you remember me, Colonel, then you<br />remember I know the drill as well as you do.
5629916 5631960 Check out<br />your own fucking plane.
5632043 5636381 We move out in five minutes.<br />Flak jackets for everybody.
5636464 5638466 Body armor for the assault team.
5638550 5641219 Night scopes for the snipers.
5641302 5643930 We will take them in the hangar,<br />and I will pull that detonator...
5644013 5647559 out of Stuart's dead<br />fucking hand myself.
5647642 5650436 - Lorenzo, take all your men back to the airport.<br />- Sir.
5650520 5654107 Seal off every exit in case any of 'em<br />tries to slip past us...
5654190 5657068 - to break out onto the ground.<br />- You got it.
5658862 5662073 All right, here we go.
5662240 5665076 [ Ruben ] Dick, this is nuts. Every station<br />in town has people at the airport...
5665160 5667370 and none has heard<br />a whisper of this shit you're running!
5667453 5670081 Well, none of them is me.<br />You want proof? Try this.
5670165 5673626 [ Burke's Voice]<br />Repeat. Terrorists have murdered civilians...
5673710 5676754 and cut off the two systems<br />that can allow you to land.
5676838 5678882 A special U.S. Army unit<br />is already here...
5678965 5681259 - and preparing to take out the terrorists.<br />- Jesus Christ.
5681342 5683386 [ Thornberg ]<br />I want you to go live now.
5683469 5685513 Key me in from the files—<br />a publicity shot, whatever.
5685597 5687640 Connie's got one. And a map—<br />Steal one from weather.
5687724 5689893 We're on it. We're cutting<br />in five minutes!
5689976 5694397 Tell the affiliates if they want in,<br />they got three minutes to shout. Let's do this.

5700111 5704616 Hey, Telford, what was your chickenshit<br />outfit doing while we were taking Grenada?
5704699 5707493 [ Laughing ]
5707577 5711748 Grenada— five minutes<br />of firefight, five weeks of surfing.
5711831 5713875 I wish I was with you guys for that.
5713958 5715919 Yeah. Me too, kid.
5716002 5719214 - Really, sir?<br />- Sure.
5719297 5721966 Then we wouldn't<br />have to do this.

5780191 5783820 [ Reporter On TV]<br />This is a special bulletin from WZDC News.
5783903 5786406 There was a plane crash<br />earlier this evening at Dulles...
5786489 5788491 where other aircraft<br />continue to circle...
5788574 5790952 with no explanation from<br />airport or F.A.A. officials.
5791035 5794247 - [ Man ] Shh! Quiet!<br />- And now, with an exclusive WZDC report...
5794330 5796874 here's Dick Thornberg reporting<br />from the skies over Washington.
5796958 5799961 -[ Man] Can you turn it up?<br />- [ Thornberg ] I'm one of the thousand people...
5800044 5802088 who has been circling<br />our nation's capital...
5802171 5806843 under the assumption that whatever problem<br />was going on far below was a normal one.
5806926 5808886 But the truth is far from normal.
5808970 5811180 The truth is terrifying.
5811264 5814475 Look out!<br />Lady, look out!
5814559 5817895 Look out! Look out!<br />Look out! Look out! Get out of the way!

5820023 5823943 - Move! Get out of the way, lady! Go! Go! Hey! Hey!<br />- Look out!
5824027 5825945 This is a recording<br />of a conversation...
5826029 5829198 between Dulles Tower<br />and the captive aircraft overhead.
5831492 5834203 - Hey! Get out of the way!<br />- [ Clamoring ]
5834287 5838082 - Lorenzo! Lorenzo!<br />- McClane, are you out of your fucking mind?
5838166 5840084 The Blue Light Team,<br />where are they?
5840168 5842795 Stuart's got explosives on the equipment<br />in the church rigged with a remote.
5842879 5846007 - Where's Grant?<br />- Grant's boys are gonna kill<br />that son of a bitch and get it.
5846090 5850094 - They're gonna get on the plane<br />and take off with him!<br />- Get the fuck out of here!
5850178 5853181 When the army canned Stuart,<br />he must have loaded that unit with his own men!
5853264 5856517 - Are you nuts? That firefight—<br />- Sideshow to jerk us off, buy 'em some time.
5856601 5858686 McClane, you are completely<br />around the fucking bend.
5858770 5860605 - You know that?<br />You know what else? You're under arrest.<br />- You motherfucker!
5860605 5861606 - You know that?<br />You know what else? You're under arrest.<br />- You motherfucker!
5867945 5870865 Here! These are the bullets<br />they used out there tonight!
5870948 5872992 Blanks!
5874452 5876996 Jesus Christ.
5884712 5886672 [On P.A.]<br />This is Chief Lorenzo.
5886756 5889884 I want every officer recalled<br />and assembled in body armor and full weaponry...
5889967 5892178 in the motor pool<br />in five minutes.
5894931 5897308 It's time to kick ass.
5899060 5901437 Just like Iwo Jima!
5901521 5904732 [ Thornberg On TV ] Since then, this reporter<br />has learned that the terrorists...
5904816 5906818 have virtual control<br />of the entire airport—

5914367 5917870 And now that the special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport...
5917954 5922542 the likelihood of a full-scale and deadly battle<br />is dangerously close.
