39039 43626 False alarm. Hold it!<br />It's OK, I'm here. It's all right.
44294 48756 - Set it down nice and easy.<br />- At the impound. Next time, read the sign.
48841 52719 You don't understand. I'm here to meet<br />my wife's plane. Let me have this car.
52803 55805 Sure. Tomorrow, 8.00 to 4.00.<br />Pay $40, we give it back.
55931 58015 Don't write it up!
58100 60017 This is my mother-in-law's car.
60102 62478 She's already mad at me<br />cos I'm not a dentist.
62563 67525 - Look, I'm a cop. LAPD.<br />- I was in LA once. Hated it.
67609 70069 I can understand. I don't like it much...
70154 72947 That's a plastic fender up there.<br />Take it easy!
73031 76159 Cut me some slack, will you?<br />I was a cop in New York City.
76243 80580 I only moved to LA cos my wife<br />took a job there. What do you say?
80664 85668 Here we are, Washington, DC, the heart<br />of democracy. One hand washes the other.
85794 87170 Come on, man. It's Christmas.
87254 89922 So ask Santa Claus to give you<br />another car.
90007 91841 Merry Christmas, pal.
93552 95553 It's all yours, Murray.
99016 100641 Son of a bitch.
142518 144644 - Hi. Where are the telephones?<br />- Over there.
144728 146604 Thank you very much.
146688 150483 <i>Leonard Adkins has a story</i><br /><i>that grows hotter by the minute.</i>
150567 154487 <i>Security was tight today</i><br /><i>at Escalan airport in Valverde,</i>
154571 158533 <i>where it is reported that deposed general,</i><br /><i>Ramón Esperanza,</i>
158617 161953 <i>will be delivered for extradition</i><br /><i>to the United States.</i>
162037 165206 <i>Two years ago,</i><br /><i>the general led his country's army</i>
165290 167667 <i>against communist insurgents</i>
167751 170837 <i>in a campaign fought with</i><br /><i>American money and advisers.</i>
170921 173381 <i>Esperanza's fall from power caused ripples</i>
173465 177677 <i>in his country's recent election,</i><br /><i>and closer to home as well,</i>
177761 181430 <i>when Pentagon officials were charged</i><br /><i>with supplying him with weapons,</i>
181515 183516 <i>despite the Congressional ban.</i>
183600 188271 <i>Evidence that Esperanza's forces violated</i><br /><i>the neutrality of neighbouring countries</i>
188355 190356 <i>made Congress withhold funds.</i>
190440 196028 <i>Funds which Esperanza is accused of</i><br /><i>replacing by going into cocaine smuggling.</i>
196113 200032 <i>Although Esperanza was removed</i><br /><i>as commander in chief this year,</i>
200117 203536 <i>the agreement to extradite him</i><br /><i>was only reached yesterday.</i>
203620 208833 <i>Washington insiders say a phone call</i><br /><i>made it happen, a phone call from a...</i>
213881 215339 All right!
219094 222179 If I could find a phone,<br />I'd call you, whoever you are.
254796 256631 Excuse me. Thank you.
265515 268100 <i>This is Lieutenant McClane.</i><br /><i>Somebody beep me?</i>
268185 272772 - I'd like to think I'm somebody.<br />- Honey! Where are you? Did you land yet?
273649 275608 It's the nineties, remember?
275692 279028 Microchips, microwaves, faxes, air phones.
280447 284450 As far as I'm concerned,<br />progress peaked with frozen pizza.
284534 287787 Listen, we're gonna be<br />about half an hour late landing.
287871 290998 I just wanted to let you know.<br />The kids OK?
291375 295670 They're about to lose their minds from all<br />the sugar your parents are giving them.
295754 298547 Did Mom give you a hard<br />time about borrowing her car?
298632 300758 No. Not yet.
301385 305596 Listen, honey, when you land,<br />can we just rent a car,
305681 308808 check into a hotel,<br />leave the kids with your parents?
308892 313187 Order some room service, a bottle<br />of champagne? What do you say?
314147 316065 You're on, Lieutenant.
316191 319568 I'll see you in half an hour, honey.<br />I love you. Bye.
324491 326826 Isn't technology wonderful?
328245 331080 - My husband doesn't think so.<br />- I do.
332249 335334 I used to carry around<br />those awful Mace things.
335419 336669 Now...
338922 342216 I zap any bastard that screws with me.
344761 346929 I tried it on my little dog.
348181 350683 Poor thing limped for a week.
358108 359525 Excuse me.
361236 363279 You look really familiar to me.
363405 365698 I get that a lot. I've been on TV.
365782 367616 Yeah. Me too.
392601 394810 - Grab the tools.<br />- You got it.
395312 398731 <i>This is Amy Nichole,</i><br /><i>live from Escalan airport,</i>

430972 435101 - Any problems with the conduit line?<br />- I don't know anything about that.
435185 438479 - Would you mind if we take a look?<br />- Help yourself.
450117 453369 It don't seem right somehow,<br />closing down this church.
453453 457623 The parish is gonna keep on using it,<br />but it won't be the same.
457707 460960 Been here a lot of years,<br />and I've been right here with it.
461044 465297 Yeah, I kind of feel like<br />a piece of me is dying with this church.

530447 533490 Everyone's in position. How's the weather?
533575 536368 We got flurries all along the Virginia coast.
536453 539455 New storm front coming in<br />from the northeast.
540540 543083 - God loves the infantry.<br />- Amen.

553929 555179 Later.
578245 582164 It's cold out there, man!<br />I stomped my feet for five minutes.
591925 594260 Two cappuccinos. Make it fast.
615448 620494 Excuse me, officers. This may sound like<br />a wild-goose chase, but I think I saw...
622205 623789 Saw what?
624874 627501 Elvis. Elvis Presley.
630463 632756 Fucking tourists. Ought to be a law.
633675 635634 There's a lot of you from<br />the Justice Department here.
635719 639471 - Is there any particular reason for that?<br />- Just routine.
639889 642308 - Any comment, sir?<br />- Not now.
643393 645185 Thank you, sir.
650233 652651 That's Colonel Stuart over there.
653069 656905 Got a little problem with personnel.<br />Last-minute replacement.
657240 660909 - How's the security here?<br />- Like we figured... a joke.
661578 663662 Colonel Stuart,<br />could we have a few words?
663747 665914 You can have two: "fuck" and "you".
665999 668334 No pictures, you pinko bitch.
670545 671962 Old news.
711711 713128 Hey, man.
715632 717966 - What is it?<br />- You got a key for this door?
718051 719802 Yeah. Why?
719928 722846 Because I want you to open it up,<br />that's why.
725392 728811 - Is there a cop on duty around here?<br />- The airport police.
728895 730312 Go get 'em.
768685 773147 All right. Perfect. Good to go.
776609 779611 It's a restricted area. What's the matter?
779696 782656 - Couldn't wait for a skycap?<br />- We work here.
783032 785033 Let's see some ID.
785118 787202 Sure. No problem.
828411 830579 Jeez. Fuck!
877794 879753 This is a tag team?
912996 914705 He came in here and flashed a badge?
914789 917708 Yeah. He said to bring you guys back here.
945028 946528 Christ.
963671 964921 Fucker!
966215 967549 Freeze!
968801 972429 Nice guess, asshole.<br />I'm a cop. That was the bad guy.
973139 974806 Where's your ID?
979145 981188 On its way to Cleveland?
987070 991657 You did not explain anything. You just<br />shoved me back here into this cattle car.
991741 995744 - Sir, you were told we were overbooked.<br />- Fine. I accept that.
995870 999164 But why can't I get the first-class<br />meal my network paid for?
999248 1002250 - Do you know who I am?<br />- Yes. We've seen your programme.
1002335 1006672 Your episode "Flying Junkyards" was<br />an objective look at air-traffic safety.
1006756 1010842 It wasn't nearly as edifying as<br />"Bimbos of the Sky", was it, Connie?
1010927 1013804 You think you're funny.
1014263 1017265 Fine. I've got your number.
1017350 1020435 And I've got yours. So park it, sir.
1022772 1023980 Fine.
1034033 1036535 - Stewardess.<br />- Mr Thornberg.
1036619 1038745 You cannot monopolise my time.
1038830 1042207 - You cannot put me near that woman.<br />- Excuse me?
1043584 1046962 He means he's filed<br />a restraining order against me.
1047463 1050048 I'm not allowed within 50 feet of him.
1050133 1055137 50 yards. So by keeping me in this<br />section, you are violating a court order.
1055805 1058181 I can sue you and this airline.
1059142 1062769 That woman assaulted me,<br />and she humiliated me in public.
1070820 1072487 What did you do?
1074240 1076575 Knocked out two of his teeth.
1077243 1079244 Would you like some champagne?
1083166 1085625 Sorry, Officer McClane. I had to check.
1085710 1088211 Here's your piece and shield back.
1089130 1090464 Thanks.
1097930 1100432 Jesus! Christ!
1101350 1104102 What the fuck are you people...<br />What are you doing?
1104187 1107105 This is a crime scene.<br />You gotta seal this area off.
1107190 1108273 That's up to the captain.
1108357 1111568 Maybe you better take me up<br />to the captain.
1122705 1125457 - Where's Cochrane?<br />- He didn't make it.
1134550 1139221 - You're late.<br />- We ran into trouble, Colonel.
1139680 1144643 Some cop killed Cochrane.<br />I barely got away, sir.
1144727 1147145 Did you accomplish your mission?
1147980 1150232 Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.
1150316 1153902 Then the damage is minimal.<br />The penalty could be severe.
1162870 1166164 You fail me again,<br />and the chamber won't be empty.
1167333 1168792 Dismissed.
1185601 1187769 Who is it? Come in.
1188771 1191022 - Captain Lorenzo?<br />- Yeah.
1191107 1193817 - I'm John McClane...<br />- I know who you are.
1193901 1196403 You're the asshole<br />that just broke seven FAA
1196487 1198655 and five District of Columbia regulations
1198739 1202117 running around my airport<br />with a gun, shooting at people.
1202243 1205495 - What do you call that shit?<br />- Self-defence.
1206205 1211209 You think that LA badge is gonna get you<br />a free lunch or something around here?
1211294 1214504 No. Maybe a little professional courtesy.
1214589 1217883 In an airport on Christmas week?<br />You gotta be kidding.
1217967 1220802 OK, fuck courtesy.<br />How about being professional?
1220928 1223889 Your boys just walked away<br />from a crime scene.
1223973 1226057 You can't wrap this up in ten minutes.
1226142 1228435 You got to seal the area off,<br />dust for prints...
1228519 1230395 Don't lecture me, hotshot.
1230479 1233648 I know what I'm doing.<br />We're gonna dust it down.
1233733 1236693 We'll take all the pictures.<br />We'll sweep for fibres.
1236777 1239654 After 400 people go through there?
1239739 1241698 You'd be lucky to get a print<br />from one of your people.
1241782 1244826 - Just shut down that area...<br />- Shut the area down?
1244952 1248163 It's that simple? Just shut the area down?
1248247 1250874 I got everybody<br />from the Shriners' convention
1250958 1253668 to the goddamn Boy Scouts in here.
1253753 1257255 I got lost kids, lost dogs...<br />Not now. Later!
1257340 1259424 I got international diplomats.
1259508 1263678 I got a fuckin' reindeer flying in here<br />from the fuckin' petting zoo.
1263804 1267015 But John McClane,<br />he's got a little problem.
1267099 1269434 Let's shut down the whole fuckin' airport.
1269518 1273813 - What do you think they'll say upstairs?<br />- Phone and find out.
1273898 1279235 I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me<br />this was some punk stealing luggage!
1279320 1281696 Luggage?<br />That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.
1281781 1284449 That's a porcelain gun made in Germany.
1284533 1286451 It doesn't show up on X-ray machines
1286535 1288536 and it costs more than you make<br />in a month.
1288621 1291289 You'd be surprised<br />what I make in a month.
1291374 1292707 If it's more than $1 .98...
1292792 1296252 Hey, McClane, don't start<br />believing your own press.
1296337 1299965 Yeah, I know all about you<br />and that Nakatomi thing in LA.
1300049 1303802 But just cos the TV thinks<br />you're hot shit, that don't make it so.
1303886 1306763 Look, you are in my little pond now,
1306847 1309391 and I am the big fish that runs it.
1310518 1313228 So you capped some lowlife. Fine.
1313312 1317565 I'll send your fuckin' captain in LA<br />a fuckin' commendation.
1317650 1319943 Now, get the hell out of my office
1320027 1323363 before I have you thrown out<br />of my goddamn airport.
1333582 1335917 Carmine, let me ask you something.
1336002 1338503 What sets off the metal detectors first?
1338587 1341339 The lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1341424 1342924 Fat fuck.
1352518 1356104 - Any ID on this guy?<br />- That's somebody else's problem.
1358691 1361276 Okay, your car is ready.<br />You could just sign right here.
1361360 1364988 I need to borrow this and this.<br />I'll bring it right back.
1367742 1369117 Hold up!
1373372 1375707 Hold up, boys. We gotta check something.
1375791 1379169 - What are you doing?<br />- Pretty gruesome fuckin' job.
1379253 1383882 All the confusion in there,<br />forgot to get this clown's prints.
1387553 1388762 Christ.
1388846 1390388 You're supposed to do that at the morgue.
1390473 1394059 Not any more. Got a new SOP<br />for DOAs from the FAA.
1398397 1401775 I don't think this one's gonna make it.<br />Thanks a lot.
1515264 1518683 - Powell here.<br />- Take that Twinkie out of your mouth.
1520019 1522645 - John, how ya doing?<br />- Holly stood me up a day
1522730 1526024 and I'm here alone in DC with my in-laws.
1527026 1531613 The old in-laws? Man, they do love<br />their policemen son-in-laws.
1531697 1536201 Listen, Al, what is the fax machine<br />telephone number there at the station?
1540414 1542290 555 321 2.
1542374 1547045 321 2. Hold on a second, all right?<br />I wanna send you something.
1547129 1548338 Excuse me.
1548422 1551382 <i>You and faxes? This is a first.</i>
1551467 1554886 Holly told me I should wake up<br />and smell the nineties.
1554970 1557096 - This way?<br />- No. That way.
1557556 1559891 - It's upside down.<br />- It doesn't matter.
1559975 1561684 Here it comes.
1564271 1568107 - I'm sending you something now.<br />- Hold on a second, cowboy.
1583666 1586417 - Fingerprints?<br /><i>- We've got an unidentified stiff.</i>
1586502 1589754 I've circled the whorls<br />in case the transmission's fuzzy.
1589838 1592799 Run it through State and Federal,<br />and maybe Interpol.
1592883 1596678 - Will do. What's this about?<br />- Just a feeling I have.
1597346 1601432 Ouch. When you get those feelings,<br />insurance companies start to go bankrupt.
1601517 1603559 The fax number is...
1603644 1608856 On the top of the transmission<br />you just got.
1611819 1616030 An airport? You're not<br />pissing in somebody's pool?
1617366 1619951 Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.
1620536 1622954 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
1626166 1628251 Just as this storm starts breaking,
1628335 1631796 the satellite-feed up<br />and drops the other shoe on us.
1631880 1633298 Look at this new front moving in.
1633382 1636467 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chickenshit.
1637886 1641806 I can sand down the runways<br />and run the ploughs between landings
1641890 1644559 but you gotta downshift them,<br />give me time to work.
1644643 1646060 You got it.
1647187 1651149 All right, everyone.<br />Let's slow down our birds
1651233 1653401 before we get a parking lot over our heads.
1653485 1657905 The line starts at the Mississippi,<br />and they better start taking numbers.
1667750 1669667 Can I get you another?
1672755 1677050 No, thank you. I only have to look<br />at his face for another 20 minutes.
1678677 1683431 <i>This is the captain speaking. I've just</i><br /><i>been informed by Dulles traffic control</i>
1683557 1686517 <i>that there's a weather front ahead of us.</i>
1686602 1689520 <i>We may be up here a little while longer.</i>
1689605 1692357 - Thank you.<br />- On second thought...
1701033 1705787 I'm right here, partner.<br />Your stiff's dossier is coming through now.
1708290 1710708 <i>- What can you tell me about him?</i><br />- He's dead.
1710793 1712460 You needed a computer to figure that out?
1712544 1714670 No, you don't follow me.
1715255 1719050 According to the Department of Defense,<br />he's been dead for two years.
1719134 1723179 - What?<br /><i>- That's right. Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.</i>
1723263 1725598 American adviser in Honduras.
1726141 1728726 Killed in a helicopter accident, 5-1 1 -88.
1728811 1730144 Officer.
1731397 1734982 <i>Read between the lines</i><br /><i>and it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff.</i>
1735109 1737902 I see it. All right, Al. Thanks a lot.
1737986 1740071 - Any time.<br />- OK.
1742449 1746327 I close in about an hour.<br />Maybe we can go get a drink?
1748914 1751791 Just the fax, ma'am.
1757005 1760258 Wait a second, I see somebody.<br />I'll call you back.
1766348 1767974 The ghost of Christmas past.
1768058 1770685 Nakatomi? LA?<br />You're John McClane, right?
1770769 1773646 - Who are you?<br />- Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
1774523 1778025 - Excuse me.<br />- Give me a break. I saw the stiff.
1778110 1780069 Word is, that was your handiwork.
1780154 1782488 No. I only do needlepoint.
1788203 1792123 Great. National just shut down.<br />Totally iced.
1792207 1795042 - They'll send us their planes.<br />- Happy holiday.
1795127 1797462 The worst part, Mr Trudeau, is the press.
1797546 1800465 They were here for the Esperanza story,
1800549 1803718 so they got it right on the news,<br />bloodstains and all.
1803844 1807221 I'd like to lock every damn reporter<br />out of the airport,
1807306 1812351 but they'd pull that freedom-of-speech crap<br />on us, then the ACLU would be all over us.
1812436 1816147 Murder on television.<br />Hell of a start for Christmas week.
1817733 1819901 What is it? A gang thing like last time?
1820027 1823362 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1824323 1826741 - Who the hell is this?<br />- I'm a police officer...
1826867 1831078 In an unauthorised area.<br />LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1831330 1834582 That's what I said about<br />my last cholesterol test.
1835083 1838044 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1839087 1841255 I'm sure Captain Lorenzo has<br />explained to you
1841340 1844008 the minor fracas with the minor thieves.
1844092 1846260 Maybe he can explain this.
1865113 1868115 <i>- All systems tapped, Colonel.</i><br />- Fire it up.
1882798 1885633 H minus five minutes. Stand by.
1887844 1891556 We've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1891640 1894392 Assuming it's not an error,<br />what do we assume?
1894476 1896686 Somebody's about to fuck<br />with this airport.
1896770 1898896 What the hell does that mean?
1898981 1902984 I know we're dummies up here,<br />so give us a taste of your genius.
1903068 1904986 A hijacking, a robbery or what?
1905070 1907446 - I'm not sure...<br />- He's not sure.
1907531 1910032 I'm stunned. I gotta lie down.
1910117 1914161 Only professionals go to this much trouble.<br />Not luggage thieves or punks.
1914246 1917415 - Professional at what?<br />- What the fuck do you think this is?
1917499 1921168 The safety patrol? This is the résumé<br />of a professional mercenary.
1921253 1924880 A major drug dealer is due here.<br />You need a slide rule to solve this,
1924965 1927758 or another body in a bag<br />before you ask questions?
1927843 1931470 You're the one that gave us<br />that fucking body. Remember that.
1931555 1933514 Yeah, I remember that.
1940063 1943524 Lorenzo, have all your<br />shift commanders report in. Now.
1943609 1947278 - What?<br />- They're to report anything unusual,
1947362 1950406 - no matter how trivial. Got that?<br />- I got it.
1950490 1952783 - My God.<br />- What?
1952868 1955703 - The runways. Look.<br />- What the hell?
1955787 1959040 - They're shutting down.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1964880 1967590 Go to emergency lighting. Now.
1967674 1971969 - Emergency. We are in a code yellow.<br />- Backup systems won't come up.
1972054 1973929 - Shunt to another terminal.<br />- Bobby, what have you got?
1974014 1975056 <i>Please respond. Please respond.</i>
1975140 1978768 - The network is down.<br />- Should we call the power company?
1978852 1980811 We're on the same grid and we're hot.
1980896 1982772 <i>Dulles, I'm on approach.</i>
1982856 1986150 - Maintain position. Repeat.<br /><i>- What's going on down there?</i>
1986234 1988944 - We're on it.<br />- We're unable right now. Delay.
1989029 1993491 Fuji 604. Execute published<br />missed-approach procedure and hold.
1993575 1996619 TWA 23, unable to clear you<br />for approach at this time.
1996703 1998996 Climb to and maintain one zero thousand.
1999081 2002083 I've checked all systems.<br />It ain't happening.
2017766 2020518 - What's it look like?<br />- Approach control is gone.
2020602 2023521 Jesus. Instrument landing system is down.
2024856 2027108 Confirmed. ILS is dead.
2027234 2030945 Every goddamn system's dead.<br />And Inmac monitors are down.
2036451 2039787 Attention all controllers.<br />We have a code-red alert.
2040580 2044875 Every aircraft approaching our sector,<br />and not already in our landing pattern,
2044960 2047962 gets diverted to their alternate airport.
2048046 2052007 Everyone already on approach,<br />or inside our pattern,
2052384 2054969 holds at the outer markers.
2055053 2057930 Stack 'em, pack 'em and rack 'em. Move.
2064146 2066647 Not a word of this leaves this room.
2066732 2071068 There must be 1 5,000 people in<br />this airport, and we don't need panic.
2071778 2074488 We just bought ourselves<br />maybe two hours.
2074906 2077992 After that, planes low on fuel<br />won't be circling.
2078076 2081036 They'll be dropping<br />on the White House lawn.
2082748 2085666 McClane, this what you expected?
2087586 2088878 No.
2089838 2092047 This is just the beginning.
2095761 2099013 - FAA hot line.<br />- How could they know already?
2099097 2100514 They can't.
2102142 2104810 Maybe it's the boys<br />who pulled your plugs.
2104895 2106645 Put it on speaker.
2107522 2110024 <i>Attention, Dulles tower. Attention.</i>
2110358 2114111 <i>They say blind men become very</i><br /><i>attentive by way of compensation.</i>
2114196 2118365 <i>Now that you're blind and deaf,</i><br /><i>I think I've got your attention.</i>
2118450 2122119 <i>I'm aware your recorders are active,</i><br /><i>so I'll be quick.</i>
2122204 2124747 <i>You can play me back</i><br /><i>to your heart's content.</i>
2124831 2127750 How did you get on this line? Who is this?
2128335 2131170 Who I am is unimportant. What I want...
2132589 2136467 If you don't want planes to splash into<br />the Potomac as they run out of fuel,
2136551 2138886 what I want is very important.
2138970 2142139 <i>A plane will be landing</i><br /><i>at this airport in 58 minutes.</i>
2142224 2145100 It is FM-1 : Foreign Military One.
2145560 2148729 <i>- I'm sure you are aware of the nature</i><br />- Esperanza?
2148814 2151732 <i>of this flight, the importance of its cargo.</i>
2152234 2155069 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2156154 2158572 It will land on a runway of my designation,
2158657 2161742 where it will remain isolated<br />and unapproached.
2162077 2166664 That will conclude my interest in this<br />aircraft and your responsibility for it.
2166748 2172545 At the same time, I want a 747 cargo<br />conversion fully fuelled
2172629 2175005 <i>and placed at my disposal.</i>
2175090 2179635 <i>You have two minutes to advise inbound</i><br /><i>aircraft to hold at their outer radio marker.</i>
2179719 2182763 <i>After that, you will be able to receive only.</i>
2183181 2187726 Any attempt to restore your systems,<br />will be met by severe penalties.
2187811 2189395 He's bluffing.
2190105 2193524 - Damn it, you can't do this.<br />- I am doing this.
2201908 2206078 I need you to punch up a code 1 5.<br />I got an idea, and I need your help.
2206621 2210875 If Esperanza gets to a country with<br />no extradition treaties, we're fucked.
2210959 2213961 They're talking to us on our system.<br />They gotta be close.
2214045 2217631 - My men will tear this airport apart.<br />- Just in the nick of time.
2217757 2220759 I got a first-class unit, SWAT team and all.
2220844 2222803 We don't need<br />Monday morning quarterbacks.
2222888 2227933 My wife's on one of the planes they're<br />fucking with! So I'm on the playing field.
2228018 2231186 If you'd have moved before,<br />we wouldn't be deep in shit.
2231271 2233439 That's it. Security. You're outta here.
2233523 2236567 Mr Trudeau, there are FAA regulations
2236651 2239570 regarding unauthorised personnel<br />in the control tower!
2239654 2241697 We just have to find a way to transmit.
2241781 2244408 Run down to Radio Shack<br />for a transmitter.
2244492 2247161 We have one - the terminal wing<br />they're building.
2247287 2250289 20 airlines when it's done,<br />all with reservation computers
2250373 2252416 in a nice antenna arrangement.
2252500 2256378 - See Mr McClane out.<br />- You got no business being up here.
2256463 2259173 Everything we need<br />is by the annexe skywalk,
2259299 2261759 just sitting there, waiting to go on line.
2261843 2264845 Goddamn it, Trudeau,<br />you're dealing with pros.
2264930 2267014 You can't fuck with these people.
2267140 2270893 Sam Coleman. WNTW News.<br />There are a lot of rumours flying around...
2270977 2273479 No way, lady. Hell, no.
2273563 2275731 This is off limits, Coleman.
2277359 2280277 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of, too!
2280362 2283948 - Get your fucking hands off me.<br />- Just get 'em out of here.
2285492 2288452 - Lobby security, come in.<br />- Tomalson here.
2288536 2292373 This is Captain Lorenzo. We've two<br />unauthorised personnel in the tower.
2292499 2295417 Get your thumb out of your ass.<br />Get 'em out of the elevator,
2295502 2298045 or you'll get a pink slip for Christmas.
2298129 2299797 1 0-4. Let's go.
2301216 2302716 Goddamn!
2303551 2307304 - Anything who can think of?<br />- Shit. Hang on over there.
2307389 2309974 - What for?<br />- Just hang on!
2310892 2314228 Big drug dealer on his way to prison.<br />Gunfight at airport.
2314312 2318482 Every controller in the coffee shop<br />getting beeped, and you rocking the boat.
2318566 2323404 - Connection? Come on, just a few words.<br />- OK, just a few words. Fuck off.
2323488 2326907 Thanks, but I already got<br />that from Colonel Stuart.
2327909 2332162 Stuart. The guy that got canned<br />by Congress. That's who he was.
2332247 2334665 Who he who? What?
2334749 2337084 It's OK, I've done this before.
2348096 2350014 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2350098 2353434 - Where's the other one?<br />- Claustrophobic, I guess.
2355103 2358230 It's a VHF system,<br />but the planes are so close, it's OK.
2358314 2362151 I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,<br />and wire in a crossover.
2362235 2366363 - You wouldn't know the difference.<br />- Get what you need. Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2366448 2368615 I want my SWAT team<br />to go with him as cover.
2368742 2371952 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of, too.
2377625 2379877 Man, I can't fucking believe this.
2379961 2382796 Another basement. Another elevator.
2382881 2386175 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?
2407322 2408989 What the fuck?
2444192 2445692 Who are you?
2447529 2449738 I'm Marvin.
2451199 2454118 I thought you was trying<br />to steal my records.
2454202 2456078 I'm just the janitor.
2463211 2467131 This is Dulles approach to all aircraft<br />holding at Potomac vortex.

2545126 2547920 - The skywalk annexe.<br />- No! The annexe skywalk.
2548004 2551548 It's the last thing I heard<br />before they kicked me out.
2551633 2553800 Let me see here.
2553927 2556428 This must be it right there. See?
2557013 2561892 That's the raised platform and there's<br />the new terminal. There's your skywalk.
2562268 2565687 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2567774 2569524 What's the fastest way<br />you can get me out to that spot?
2573154 2575864 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2575949 2580077 - Mr Barnes, we'll watch your back.<br />- Yeah? Who watches yours?
2591673 2593590 Main ventilation duct.
2593883 2597844 Ventilation duct... and bingo.
2598304 2602599 Just once, I'd like<br />a regular, normal Christmas.
2604644 2607980 Eggnog, a fucking Christmas tree,
2609691 2611316 a little turkey.
2612652 2616863 But, no. I gotta crawl around<br />in this motherfuckin' tin can.
2622036 2624871 We're in the annexe skywalk.<br />I can see the array.
2624998 2629543 I'll give you a call for a protocol test<br />when it's hot. That's all for now.
2629627 2634214 Sergeant, we need more equipment.<br />I'd like to send one of your guys for it.
2639178 2642472 - What the hell's going on?<br />- Put that back on!
2645226 2649646 - Hey, asshole, what do I look like to you?<br />- A sitting duck.
2654402 2655902 Shit!
2657739 2660240 Damn it. I hate it when I'm right.
2766931 2768515 Stay down!
2782697 2784030 Fuck.
2815521 2817397 Fucking son of a bitch.
2834040 2835373 Shit.
2845760 2848303 I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.
2881712 2884422 - Jeez.<br />- You all right?
2885216 2889219 Yeah. But the antenna array,<br />I gotta get to it and set it up.
2893641 2895225 Get down!
2914287 2915662 Goddamn.
2918624 2919958 Bait.
2922003 2923503 Jerk us off.
2924839 2927465 Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.
2931262 2933305 Make you waste your time.
2936684 2938184 Time we don't have.
2952783 2955285 I think you're closer than 50 yards.
2955369 2958538 So's that airplane. Practically.
2958623 2962917 Yeah. There's quite a few of them.<br />It looks like a regular traffic jam.
2963002 2965462 There's nothing regular about it.
2966130 2967964 See? You're intrigued.
2968049 2971051 That's my gift, Mrs McClane.<br />I notice things.
2971135 2975305 Things other people wouldn't see.<br />That's how I make people curious.
2975890 2978224 Don't you mean nauseous?
2978309 2982020 The people have a right to know<br />everything about everybody.
2982438 2983980 You got in the way of that.
2984065 2986524 Listen, buster.<br />You endangered my children.
2986609 2990320 You didn't do it<br />for anything as noble as "the people".
2990404 2991946 The only time you see the people
2992031 2995492 is when you look down to see<br />what you're stepping on.
2999580 3003667 Me? I'll live,<br />but Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead
3004168 3006419 and the antenna array is gone.
3007004 3008755 Didn't you see it?
3010383 3012759 Start looking for a new miracle.
3017223 3020141 Hold for a second. Something's going on.
3022103 3025021 I say again, annexe team, give us a sit rep.
3026607 3029067 Annexe team, come in. Do you copy?
3030611 3034155 It's got a scrambler on it.<br />Can you do anything with it?
3035908 3039536 No. This scramble mode<br />must activate on this code panel.
3039620 3043873 Even if we scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in. These guys are pros.
3043958 3046876 So are you. Break the code.<br />I wanna hear these bastards.
3046961 3050380 This is a ten-digit control panel.<br />Six-digit read-out.
3050464 3053049 Hell, there could be<br />a million combinations.
3053134 3057137 Next time you kill one of these guys,<br />get him to enter the code first.
3059807 3065061 Sir, we monitored a call from their chief<br />engineer. We took out their SWAT team.
3065146 3068189 So they did go for the antenna array.<br />We're on schedule.
3068274 3071025 Losing our team wasn't part of the plan.
3077658 3080827 Attention, Dulles control tower.
3081328 3083580 <i>Mr Trudeau, I know you're listening.</i>
3083664 3087292 <i>- Unfortunately, you're not obeying.</i><br />- Try me face to face.
3087376 3089669 You were warned<br />not to restore your systems.
3089754 3093506 <i>You've wasted lives and precious time</i><br /><i>on a futile and obvious target.</i>
3094341 3096342 Now you're gonna pay the penalty.
3096427 3100513 I got five dead officers, Colonel Stuart.<br />Isn't that penalty enough?
3100848 3104017 McClane, keep out of this.<br />You've been a pain...
3105644 3109355 McClane. John McClane.
3110357 3114360 The policeman hero who saved<br />the Nakatomi hostages.
3114487 3116279 <i>I read about you in People magazine.</i>
3116363 3118865 <i>You seemed out of</i><br /><i>your league on Nightline.</i>
3118949 3123787 Colonel, blow me. How much drug money<br />is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
3123871 3128875 Cardinal Richelieu said it best:<br />"Treason is merely a matter of dates."
3129543 3134214 <i>This country's got to learn it can't keep</i><br /><i>cutting the legs off of men like Esperanza.</i>
3134298 3138218 Men who have the guts to stand up<br />against communist aggression.
3139470 3144224 Lesson one starts with killing policemen?<br />What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?
3146060 3149103 No. I think we can find something<br />in-between.
3151315 3152816 Watch this.
3153776 3156903 Give me a flight number.<br />One that's low on fuel.
3158239 3162492 Windsor 1 14. Transatlantic from London.<br />Fuel tank's dry as a martini.
3163410 3170083 Activate the ILS landing system, but<br />recalibrate sea level... minus 200 feet.
3194775 3198778 Jesus. They've reset<br />ground level, minus 200 feet.
3199530 3203783 Windsor flight 1 14. This is<br />Dulles approach. Do you copy?
3204994 3208496 Dulles approach, this is Windsor 1 14.<br />Where the devil have you been?
3208581 3212667 <i>Windsor 1 14.</i><br /><i>We've been right here all along, old buddy.</i>
3213127 3215837 <i>Our systems only came back on line</i><br /><i>just now.</i>
3216839 3222135 Windsor 1 14, you are cleared<br />for ILS approach, runway two-niner.
3222678 3226931 <i>- Contact Dulles at the outer marker.</i><br />- Jesus Christ, he's gonna crash the plane.
3227016 3232061 Roger, approach, and about time. I've got<br />230 people up here flying on petrol fumes.
3232563 3235064 <i>Roger, 1 14. Understand. Calibrate Dulles...</i>
3235149 3237859 - Jesus.<br />- They'll fly right into the concrete.
3237943 3239485 Son of a bitch!
3240154 3243656 - Why are they listening to him?<br />- It's our frequency.
3244325 3245575 Damn.
3245659 3247744 - Barnes.<br /><i>- This is Dulles tower.</i>
3247828 3249913 <i>We have radar contact...</i>
3250581 3252415 Give me your coat.
3253292 3257211 - What are you gonna do?<br />- Whatever I can.
3261050 3264594 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we've started our descent.
3264678 3268431 <i>Sorry for the inconvenience,</i><br /><i>but we'll all be on the ground shortly.</i>
3268515 3270850 Please keep your seat belts on.
3271685 3276105 We've made arrangements for your<br />next flight, so you won't miss it.
3276190 3278149 In your seat, please.
3281904 3285573 We're just like British Rail, love.<br />We may be late, but we get you there.
3285658 3287075 Don't worry.
3303884 3305677 Good luck, McClane!
3328409 3331911 Dulles, this is Windsor 1 14<br />inside the outer marker.
3332579 3335456 Roger, 1 14. This is Dulles tower.
3335541 3337667 We have radar contact<br />and show you on ILS.
3337751 3340586 You're in the glide path and looking good.
3349888 3352098 There's somebody out there!
3356103 3358938 It's McClane. Christ.
3363527 3365194 Approach flaps.
3367239 3368990 Approach speed 140.
3370576 3371993 1 30.
3372661 3376372 - Altitude 1 ,000 feet.<br />- 800, guys. You're only at 800 feet.
3376457 3380334 <i>Fire and rescue. Roll everything</i><br /><i>onto runway two-niner.</i>
3381128 3384881 <i>Ref speed plus 20. 600 feet.</i>
3386300 3391304 Looking good, Windsor. Watch it.<br />30-knot crosswinds and the runway is icy.
3392056 3394098 Attaboy. We've gotcha.
3395225 3396809 We've gotcha.
3410032 3411532 Pull it up!
3412367 3413659 Jesus!
3428342 3429842 We've gotcha.
3456870 3458121 God.
3463001 3464585 Motherfucker.
3486233 3489443 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3489528 3491946 If the 747 we requested is ready on time
3492030 3495449 and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested,
3495534 3497702 further lessons can be avoided.
3497786 3499078 Out.
3545042 3548961 We got no sign of survivors.<br />It's a goddamn nightmare.
3563977 3566896 Barnes! We've got to warn those planes
3566980 3571484 there's a lunatic pretending<br />he's the tower. Get me on the air.
3571568 3573736 - How?<br />- You figure it out!
3574112 3575988 Here's the manifest.
3596093 3598511 I know how you must feel.
3603684 3606352 I wanted to help those people tonight.
3607646 3609939 I was pretty goddamn useless.
3613944 3618739 We called the government for help.<br />They're gonna send in a Special army unit.
3620200 3622285 A counterterrorist team.
3629793 3631627 Your wife's plane...
3632671 3636340 They're still broadcasting,<br />even though we can't answer.
3638427 3641387 They're gonna run out of fuel<br />in 90 minutes.
3653108 3655609 Listen, Dick. That is your name?
3656361 3662450 Dick. If you're gonna continue to get<br />this close, could you switch aftershaves?
3664161 3665745 Anything else?
3666413 3668914 Stronger mouthwash might be nice.
3669499 3672251 <i>Sam Coleman is reporting</i><br /><i>live from the accident.</i>
3672336 3676422 Colonel, they've done<br />everything we've anticipated... so far.
3676548 3679550 <i>But still there has been no official word.</i>
3679634 3684013 <i>Despite the fact that only one runway</i><br /><i>has been closed due to the tragedy,</i>
3684097 3688934 <i>several dozen airliners are visible,</i><br /><i>endlessly circling the field.</i>
3689019 3692188 <i>Other reports say there</i><br /><i>had been trouble in the tower,</i>
3692272 3694523 <i>and that may have contributed to it.</i>
3694608 3697109 <i>With weather conditions worsening,</i>
3697194 3700404 <i>the problem here and in</i><br /><i>the sky above us will grow.</i>
3700489 3703783 <i>I'm Samantha Coleman</i><br /><i>at Dulles International Airport.</i>
3711249 3714210 - Victor.<br />- Yeah, what's up?
3714294 3717171 Did you pack the radio mikes<br />from the shoot or are they here?
3717255 3719757 I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em in!
3719841 3721217 I love you.
3721301 3723552 Give me one of the receivers.
3727641 3730518 Can you tune into the cockpit frequency?
3730977 3733979 - Yeah. Why?<br />- I wanna hear what's going on.
3736608 3739110 Should be right here on our band.
3739945 3742488 - Nothing.<br />- You said it would work. Is it working?
3742572 3746659 It is working, but all I'm getting<br />is some kind of airport beacon.
3747077 3750079 It's weird. It's like the tower isn't there.
3753083 3754834 Stay on it.
3756002 3758838 Let me know<br />when there is something there.
3797711 3800087 - Major Grant.<br />- Rollins, Department of Justice.
3800172 3802214 Trudeau, Chief of Air Operations.
3802340 3806469 Lorenzo, Terminal Police.<br />You want something, you got it.
3806553 3809472 This is it? One fucking platoon?
3809556 3812975 - One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?<br />- John McClane.
3813059 3817354 - You showed some balls out there.<br />- Yeah.
3817439 3821317 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3821401 3824487 Looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3824571 3827907 - Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?<br />- Not any more.
3827991 3831911 We're here to take Colonel Stuart down.<br />And we will take him down.
3831995 3835664 I served with him.<br />I taught him everything he knows.
3835749 3838918 Maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3841087 3844840 Let's hustle. The command post will be<br />set up in the airport police station.
3844925 3847676 I wanna be tied in to the tower<br />in 1 5 minutes.
3847761 3849595 Let's do it!
3855227 3857603 Things just get better or worse?
3861525 3865528 - Lights. Big, portable lights.<br />- We set up the field, and then we...
3865612 3867238 Wait for those lunatics to shoot 'em out?
3867322 3870115 Where do we get the lights?<br />From Batman?
3870200 3874662 - What about the air phone idea?<br />- 1 8 planes are up there. Five have phones.
3874746 3877206 We got through to three.<br />We're trying the others.
3877290 3879291 That's 1 3 accidents waiting to happen.
3879376 3881293 -Are they still bucking headwinds?<br />-I just checked the weather.
3881378 3883712 Headwinds are slamming everybody<br />over the outer marker.
3883797 3885923 The planes with enough fuel<br />have been shunted to Atlanta,
3886007 3887007 Memphis and Nashville.
3888468 3890803 Outer marker. Damn!
3891930 3893597 The outer marker!
3894266 3898602 It's a beacon. It sends out this "beep<br />beep beep" so they know they're over it.
3898687 3901647 - So?<br />- Who says that signal has to just beep?
3901731 3905568 Right. Switch the frequency from<br />the tower to the one in the beacon.
3905652 3906986 Pump up the wattage.
3907070 3911740 We can talk to our planes, and those<br />bastards who did this will never know!
3913660 3916745 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3916830 3919582 They've been tapped into<br />your tower chatter all night.
3919666 3922209 Punks stealing luggage, Carmine?
3925422 3928090 - How you doin', Telford?<br />- No good.
3928174 3931427 I called Lang. They'll have<br />a portable decoder here in two hours.
3931511 3935431 - My wife doesn't have two hours.<br />- I was put on Grant's team yesterday.
3935515 3937975 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3938476 3941937 Word is, nobody's better<br />at this than Major Grant.
3942022 3944189 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3945692 3948611 I wanna hear about<br />the plane those bastards asked for.
3948695 3952448 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.<br />Pilots' briefing room - now!
3952532 3955534 - Keep working.<br />- Albertson. With me!
3960373 3961915 No civilians.
3973053 3975679 - What the fuck...<br />- What is it?
3977057 3980684 The outer marker beeper isn't beeping.<br />It's talking.
3981519 3985981 <i>All aircraft in Dulles landing pattern.</i><br /><i>This is chief engineer, Leslie Barnes.</i>
3986274 3989443 I have been authorised to brief you in full.
3989527 3993072 At this time, this is the only<br />channel available to us.
3993907 3998160 Here is the situation.<br />Approximately two hours ago...
4001831 4005125 - Get a load of this.<br /><i>- ..claiming to be from our tower</i>
4005210 4008504 <i>unless you hear</i><br /><i>your flight recorder access code.</i>

4011591 4014343 <i>..control of everything except this channel.</i>

4024771 4026855 <i>They have already caused one crash</i>
4026940 4029858 <i>- by impersonating our tower.</i><br />- Jesus.
4040286 4044957 <i>Repeat. The terrorists have cut off</i><br /><i>the two systems that allow you to land,</i>
4045041 4049378 <i>field lights for a visual landing</i><br /><i>and the ILS for an instrument.</i>
4049462 4053799 <i>A Special US army unit is here,</i><br /><i>preparing to take out the terrorists.</i>
4053883 4055467 My God.
4057220 4061557 - Hey, you interested in a nice coat?<br />- It never looked good on me anyway.
4061641 4064685 You gotta get me up<br />to the pilots' briefing room.
4064769 4068313 I gotta hear what they're saying.<br />Which map gets me in there?
4068398 4070315 - Don't touch it.<br />- Find the map.
4070400 4073694 I'll find it. You'll mess up<br />my whole damn filing system.
4073778 4077072 Pilots' briefing room,<br />I think that's in the main terminal.
4077157 4080701 So would that be under P<br />for "pilots' briefing room"?
4080785 4084663 - Now, Marvin!<br />- Or maybe under M for "miscellaneous".
4089794 4092045 <i>Request permission to reduce sentry duty</i><br /><i>to 30-minute rotation.</i>

4110607 4114902 The dominoes will fall no more<br />and the ramparts will remain upright.
4114986 4118489 Sir, General Esperanza's plane<br />just came on the scope.
4125163 4128665 Attention, Dulles tower.<br />We will be lighting up a runway.
4128750 4132503 <i>Do not, repeat,</i><br /><i>do not attempt to land any planes.</i>
4132587 4135047 Remember, we're monitoring you.
4138051 4141595 - What do we do?<br />- Obey.
4148228 4153273 Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael One.
4153358 4157110 This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.<br />We read you. Over.
4157195 4162241 Foxtrot Michael One, you are<br />to come in on runway 1 -5.
4176506 4180509 I found it on the floor, by the coat,<br />next to the luggage belt.
4180593 4183136 What the hell you so excited for?
4183221 4186431 - The code's still punched into this one.<br />- You like it.
4186516 4189518 How about you give me 20 bucks for it?
4189602 4194106 - How about I let you live?<br />- The man knows how to bargain.
4194858 4197192 This is contrary to our instructions.
4197277 4199653 We are to land at runway 1 -0,
4199737 4203615 where we are to be met<br />by representatives of your Justice...
4204284 4208579 Captain, please tell the tower<br />you will proceed as ordered.
4219549 4224177 Roger, Dulles. Proceeding to runway 1 -5.
4240737 4243405 Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.
4243615 4246742 What are you gonna do now?<br />Are you gonna shoot me?
4246826 4248285 So who will fly the plane?
4248369 4251455 Don't worry about it. It's not your problem.
4258004 4259504 Michael One. Do you copy?
4264177 4266553 Foxtrot Michael One, come in.
4275730 4278315 Eagle Nest. This is Falcon. Mayday.
4283363 4284780 Go ahead, Falcon.
4284864 4288033 I've lost cabin pressure.<br />Near-zero visibility.
4288618 4293080 I must drop out of this weather and land<br />now, on the first accessible runway.
4293164 4297668 <i>Repeat. I've lost cabin pressure.</i><br /><i>Near-zero visibility.</i>
4297752 4299544 <i>I must drop out of the storm.</i>
4299629 4303840 <i>I can land, but I must land now,</i><br /><i>on the first outgoing runway.</i>
4304342 4307511 <i>Repeat. I cannot circle around</i><br /><i>to runway 1-5.</i>
4311975 4313934 I'll make you a deal.
4314018 4316979 Show me out to those runways<br />and I'll get you a liner for that coat.
4317063 4320607 Repeat. I cannot circle around<br />to runway 1 -5.
4320692 4321900 Shit!
4322026 4323694 Stand by, Falcon.
4325571 4327656 He's coming in from the ocean, sir.

4339711 4342045 <i>That would be 2-5 right.</i>
4344298 4346383 Make up your fucking mind.
4347260 4350262 We are just up to our ass<br />in terrorists again, John.
4350346 4352055 2-5 left.
4352765 4354141 2-5 right.
4355727 4358103 I gotta quit smoking cigarettes.
4358229 4360856 Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.
4360940 4364651 But if you could show it to me as well,<br />I would be grateful.
4375580 4378999 <i>I see the lights.</i><br /><i>They are directly in front of me.</i>

4487733 4488942 Shit!
4549337 4550670 Freedom.
4551797 4553173 Not yet.
4555009 4558470 You should stay in your seat until<br />the plane reaches the terminal.
4558554 4560805 No frequent-flier mileage for you.
4560890 4562974 - Who are you?<br />- A cop.
4563059 4565101 - A cop?<br />- Yeah, one of the good guys.
4565186 4570190 And you're a bad guy. Now I've got your<br />sorry ass, I'm gonna trade it for my wife.
4578950 4580367 Sit down!
4591295 4593505 - Where'd he go?<br />- In there.
4603057 4604266 I don't believe this.
4604350 4608019 Two months of planning, and<br />you can't anticipate one pendejo of a cop.
4608104 4611147 - Come on, General.<br />- Where is Colonel Stuart?
4614819 4617112 - General!<br />- I'm all right.
4617196 4620991 He said he was a policeman.<br />I thought you had this place secured.
4621075 4624202 - He went in the cockpit.<br />- He's going to hell.
4627498 4629666 I assume it's you, McClane.
4630376 4632961 You're quite a little soldier.
4633045 4635880 You can consider this a military funeral!
4661240 4664034 - How many grenades we got?<br />- Three each!
4664327 4665660 Use 'em!
4676255 4677589 Fuck.
4691687 4692937 Go!
4720716 4722425 You lucky fuck.
4725429 4728848 - Fire trucks, sir.<br />- Fall back to the church. Now!
4751622 4753748 Where's the fuckin' door?
4768514 4772225 They're getting a little nervous back there.<br />In fact, so am I.
4772309 4776312 We're over Washington. See if you<br />can get any TV to settle 'em down.
4776397 4778314 Works for me. I'll...
4802047 4806050 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the video sleaze awards?
4806135 4808887 - Try Pulitzer.<br /><i>- While waiting to land,</i>
4808971 4813766 <i>we are turning on local Washington TV.</i><br /><i>The sound is on channel three.</i>
4832328 4836080 Please, sir, we may land at any moment.<br />If you'll take your seat...
4836207 4839584 - I'm gonna be sick.<br />- Sir, the seat-belt light is on.
4844757 4846007 Moron.
4846091 4848426 - WZDC.<br />- This is Richard Thornberg.
4848511 4851179 - Put me through to Ruben.<br /><i>- He's about to go live.</i>
4851263 4854807 - I know he is. That's why I need him.<br /><i>- You'll have to hold on...</i>
4854892 4858269 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your résumé.
4859188 4863066 Esperanza's down... but he's hurt.
4864360 4868863 He took a round in his shoulder. I got one<br />more of their guys. That's six they lost.
4868948 4872116 If we knew how many they had,<br />we could get excited,
4872201 4876037 but if they got 50 guys,<br />it's a little early to open the champagne.
4876121 4879832 We appreciate your effort, but we<br />don't need a loose cannon here.
4879917 4883211 What if they crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your stunt?
4883295 4885713 They can't do that now, right, Barnes?
4885798 4888716 And if I'd grabbed Esperanza,<br />this'd be over now.
4888801 4891386 Maybe they're more creative<br />than you think.
4891470 4893972 At least I'm thinking, goddamn it.
4894682 4898560 We're here to jerk off that cocksucker<br />until he tries to take off. Period!
4898644 4902313 You're the wrong guy<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time.
4904400 4906234 The story of my life.
4907403 4910321 Major. Pentagon situation room, sir.
4910406 4913741 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.<br />Thank you, Telford.
4913826 4915743 You men come with me.
4918414 4920248 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4920332 4922083 You said those guys<br />showed up right away?
4922167 4923126 Yeah.
4923210 4926546 So that must mean they're<br />on the field or close.
4926630 4930466 I think I know where.<br />Come here, let me show you something.
4932761 4937432 These are the old plans with the<br />longer runways. That's 1 2 years ago.
4937516 4941936 Looks like they've modified the site,<br />moved Tra-Con phones, ILS,
4942021 4945231 all the underground stuff,<br />so they could handle drainage.
4945316 4948610 If I'm right, all of it would run<br />along the airport property
4948694 4951446 and go right past this neighbourhood.
4962374 4965877 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess.
4966712 4969964 Unfortunately, there isn't anyone<br />we can blame for the weather.
4970049 4973051 Yeah? What about that porker,<br />Willard Scott?
4973552 4978056 I should have taken the bus. At least<br />they can pull over for food and gas.
4978140 4980433 - Excuse me.<br />- Yes?
4981727 4987398 I was just wondering. This flight originally<br />was supposed to be five and a half hours.
4988400 4991277 Do we have enough fuel to keep circling?
4991362 4994739 Of course. They anticipate<br />little problems like this.
5012925 5015843 We looked at 1 2 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
5015928 5018221 This is our last possibility.
5018847 5021933 - Over here there's an old church.<br />- Let's go.
5026689 5027897 Wait.
5035364 5037699 There's the church over there.
5045541 5049043 - Could be a sentry.<br />- He could just be out for a walk.
5049128 5052130 Then why is he going over<br />his own footsteps?
5054341 5055633 Come on.
5057636 5061347 All right. Just stay here<br />and get ready to call the marines.
5061432 5065560 - I thought they were the army.<br />- Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
5082327 5085955 Shit. Not now.
5100471 5102472 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5102556 5104682 <i>Where the hell are you? Where's McClane?</i>
5104767 5108186 With me, at the community church,<br />to the west of the airport.
5108270 5111189 Where? Goddamn it.<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't...
5111273 5114692 <i>This must be their operations base.</i><br /><i>Shut up and get your ass here!</i>
5114777 5116527 Code red. Sit rep.
5117196 5120448 We got positive ID on Stuart's location.<br />Let's move.
5132461 5136214 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
5137466 5139884 If there are no more surprises.
5154316 5157068 Gentlemen, we have a situation here.
5234605 5236480 They're over here.
5248785 5251203 Jeez, you all right? You want a medic?
5251288 5254582 What the hell you think you're doin'?<br />Playing John Wayne?
5254666 5256667 How'd you like to spend the night in a cell?
5256752 5260504 Shut the fuck up and do<br />something useful. Seal off the street.
5260589 5264008 - Hey, you can't talk to me like that.<br />- No, Carmine?
5264092 5267929 Sergeant, get this bureaucrat<br />out of Mr McClane's face - now!
5268013 5269972 With pleasure, sir.
5272100 5275519 Major, the men are in position, sir.
5275604 5278606 Close up the back, then we go in.<br />Fire only on my order.
5278690 5280232 Roger that, sir.
5280317 5284695 Guess I was wrong about you.<br />You're not such an asshole after all.
5284988 5288366 No, you were right.<br />I'm just your kind of asshole.
5297376 5299794 Garber, sit rep!
5299878 5303130 Army Special Forces<br />on three sides, closing in fast!
5303215 5306384 - Another problem, Colonel?<br />- No problem, General.
5306969 5309387 Gentlemen, you know what to do.
5320732 5322692 - Down!<br />- Get down!
5351513 5354098 General... it's time.
5361356 5363274 Come on, let's move it.
5377873 5380958 - They're pulling out... at the back.<br />- What?
5389009 5390259 Move it!
5400270 5402813 Albertson, your men around the back.
5428632 5430925 This equipment could land our planes.
5431009 5433761 Don't touch anything.<br />If it's booby-trapped...
5433845 5434804 It is.
5434888 5438099 Got one here. Looks like C-4.<br />The motherfucker is armed.
5438183 5440559 Clear the area. Everybody, now!
5444189 5446857 They booby-trapped the equipment.<br />Seal it off.
5446942 5448192 Shit!
5451947 5453697 Where the fuck is McClane?
5503290 5505124 Miller, take him.
5506418 5508252 I'll cover you.
5554966 5557468 So much for the element of chance.
5558470 5560179 Let's move out.
5577322 5580324 I had the bastard in my sights. I know I did.
5591211 5593212 Jesus Christ.
5599010 5600719 <i>Attention, Dulles tower.</i>
5600804 5603430 <i>This is Colonel Stuart.</i><br /><i>Is our plane prepared?</i>
5603515 5607685 It is. It's in hangar 1 1 .<br />It's the most remote building we've got.
5608812 5613983 We're on our way. Have a ground crew<br />there to confirm the condition of the plane.
5614609 5617569 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5617654 5620656 Colonel, you're capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5620740 5623951 <i>Don't ask us to gift-wrap</i><br /><i>potential hostages for you.</i>
5624035 5627371 - Major Grant, isn't it?<br /><i>- If you remember me, Colonel,</i>
5627455 5630499 <i>then you remember</i><br /><i>I know the drill as well as you do.</i>
5631334 5633752 Check out your own fuckin' plane.
5633837 5637840 We move out in five minutes.<br />Flak jackets for everybody.
5637924 5642094 Body armour for the assault team.<br />Night scopes for the snipers.
5642178 5643595 We go to the hangar.
5643680 5648017 I will pull that detonator out of<br />Stuart's dead fuckin' hand myself.
5648977 5651562 Lorenzo,<br />take all your men back to the airport.
5651646 5656859 Seal off every exit in case they try to slip<br />past us to break out onto the ground.
5656943 5658360 You got it.
5660405 5662323 All right, here we go.
5663241 5665659 <i>This is nuts!</i><br /><i>Every station has people at the airport.</i>
5665744 5667786 <i>No one has heard a whisper of this!</i>
5667871 5671373 None of them is me.<br />You want proof, try this.
5671750 5674501 <i>Terrorists have murdered civilians</i>
5674586 5677755 <i>and cut off the two systems</i><br /><i>that allow you to land.</i>
5677839 5681425 <i>A Special US army unit is here,</i><br /><i>preparing to take out the terrorists.</i>
5681509 5684178 - Jesus Christ.<br /><i>- I want you to go live now.</i>
5684262 5688015 Key me in from the files, a publicity shot.<br />Steal a map from weather.
5688099 5691101 We're on it. We're cutting in five minutes.
5691227 5696023 Tell the affiliates, if they want in, they got<br />three minutes to shout. Let's do this.
5696399 5698067 Network, here I come.
5701279 5706116 Telford, what was your chickenshit outfit<br />doing while we were taking Grenada?
5708078 5712748 Grenada. Five minutes of firefight,<br />five weeks of surfing.
5713500 5717419 - I wish I was with you guys for that.<br />- Yeah. Me too, kid.
5718171 5720297 - Really, sir?<br />- Sure.
5721800 5724301 Then we wouldn't have to do this.
5739067 5741360 Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.
5742320 5745280 On schedule... and in position.
5745365 5747825 Roger, Hatchling. We are secure here.
5747909 5752246 <i>You have a green light.</i>
5763842 5767469 Jesus, officer, where'd<br />you come from, Pearl Harbor?
5772809 5774977 Let's clear it out, please.
5778773 5780858 Five, four, three...
5781734 5784611 <i>This is a special bulletin</i><br /><i>from WZDC News.</i>
5784696 5789241 <i>There has been a plane crash at Dulles,</i><br /><i>where other aircraft still circle,</i>
5789325 5792619 <i>with no explanation</i><br /><i>from airport or FAA officials.</i>
5792704 5795664 <i>And now, with an exclusive WZDC report,</i>
5795748 5799501 <i>here's Dick Thornberg reporting</i><br /><i>from the skies over Washington.</i>
5799586 5802921 <i>I'm one of the people circling our capital</i>
5803006 5804840 <i>under the assumption</i><br /><i>that whatever problem</i>
5804924 5807718 <i>there was below was a normal one.</i>
5808219 5811930 <i>But the truth is far from normal.</i><br /><i>The truth is terrifying.</i>
5820440 5822816 Get out of the way, lady!
5825028 5826987 This is a recording of a conversation
5827071 5830574 between Dulles tower<br />and a captive aircraft overhead.
5836581 5839333 - Lorenzo!<br />- Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
5839417 5843253 - Where's the Blue Light team?<br />- Stuart's rigged explosives to a remote.
5843338 5844379 Where's Grant?
5844464 5846673 His boys are gonna kill that son of a bitch.
5846758 5850469 - No, they're gonna take off with him.<br />- Get the fuck outta here.
5850553 5853555 When the army canned Stuart,<br />he put his men in that unit.
5853640 5857601 - Are you nuts? That firefight...<br />- Sideshow to buy him some time.
5857685 5860312 You are completely<br />around the fuckin' bend.
5860396 5862981 You're under arrest, motherfucker.
5870031 5873659 These are the bullets they<br />used out there tonight. Blanks!
5876204 5877746 Jesus Christ.
5885838 5889341 This is Chief Lorenzo.<br />I want every officer recalled
5889425 5893845 and in body armour and full weaponry<br />in the motor pool in five minutes.
5895890 5897975 It's time to kick ass.
5900103 5902354 Just like Iwo Jima.
5902438 5908235 <i>We have learned that</i><br /><i>the terrorists have control of the airport,</i>
5908319 5911196 <i>a fact that the authorities have repressed.</i>
5911281 5915200 <i>The terrorists promise more bloodshed</i><br /><i>unless their demands are met.</i>
5915285 5918912 Now that the Special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport,
5918997 5923292 the likelihood of a full-scale<br />battle is dangerously close.
5944772 5949693 That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.<br />It's all over the airport.
5950528 5952487 <i>300 people have died</i>
5954866 5957784 <i>and, unfortunately,</i><br /><i>they may not be the last.</i>
5957869 5961163 <i>The horrifying fact is that</i><br /><i>no one is safe,</i>
5961247 5964791 <i>either in the planes above Dulles</i><br /><i>or in the terminal below.</i>
5964876 5970047 <i>The threat of a higher body count at the</i><br /><i>airport hangs over the heads of everyone,</i>
5970131 5974134 <i>and the holiday season of peace</i><br /><i>and love has become a nightmare.</i>
5980808 5986605 Listen up, all units. I want<br />you to converge on hangar 1 1 , all sides.
5986689 5988940 This car, McClane. Get in!
5989025 5991485 When the city blue show up<br />with their backup,
5991569 5994821 they'll pick up the pieces. Move out!
5995823 5999951 - McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.<br />- Merry Christmas.
6001329 6002746 Hi.
6008378 6012547 Goddamn it to hell!<br />Move that piece of shit.
6014175 6016927 Will you move that goddamn<br />piece of shit out of here?
6017011 6021848 Vito, get the fuck out of the car<br />and get your ass in gear and help me!
6026729 6028980 Hey, Coleman!
6033903 6036029 - Hey, Coleman!<br />- Hi.
6039117 6042953 ..but at least the truth<br />is not among the hostages
6043037 6047207 because I, Richard Thornberg,<br />just happened to be here
6047959 6054423 to put his life and talent<br />on the line for humanity and country.
6054507 6057300 If this should be my final broadcast...
6059470 6061847 Amen to that, Dick.
6062974 6067144 <i>Dick? We're live, Dick.</i><br /><i>Where are you now?</i>
6071023 6074985 Truck lights approaching, sir.<br />They're here, right on schedule.
6075653 6077738 The hangar door, open it.
6078156 6079531 Clockwork.
6102889 6106391 Jeez, you give me this story,<br />and I'll have your baby.
6106851 6108935 Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.
6120782 6123867 Colonel, if I may say so,<br />you are some piece of work.
6123951 6127037 Thank you, Major.<br />You're not so bad yourself.
6127538 6130791 - Congratulations on your escape, sir.<br />- Thank you, Major.
6130875 6133001 You should save them<br />until we are all safe.
6133085 6134085 Sir.
6134170 6138465 My congratulations, gentlemen.<br />You've won a victory for our way of life,
6138549 6142427 my pride, my admiration,<br />and a kick-ass vacation.
6142512 6144221 Now, get on board.
6174669 6177295 - Ride too rough, cowboy?<br />- I don't like to fly.
6177380 6179756 - So why are you here?<br />- I don't like to lose.
6191978 6195856 I don't know about you, but I've seen<br />enough snow to last me a lifetime.
6195940 6200944 - You don't get much of that in the tropics.<br />- For you gentlemen, we'll import it.
6203489 6205657 Shit. They left the hangar.
6209120 6211121 Right there. Get that.
6211205 6213206 - Now what?<br />- Get in front.
6213291 6215375 Block their path so they can't get out.
6215459 6217544 I'm not playing chicken<br />with a 200-ton plane!
6217628 6219629 I'm crazy, but not that crazy.
6219714 6223633 <i>- Dulles, this is Northeast 140.</i><br />- That's Holly's plane.

6236606 6239357 I'm not getting in front of that plane.
6243654 6245530 How about gettin' over top of it?
6245823 6248450 This is the captain. Your attention.
6248534 6251828 We have no choice<br />but to attempt an emergency landing.
6251913 6255040 Fasten your seat belts<br />and assume crash positions,

6271349 6273016 I don't wanna die.
6274101 6275518 I'm sorry.
6279273 6280565 God!
6290201 6292827 Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

6302338 6306341 You wanted a story.<br />Nice and easy, boys. Get me in low.
6311305 6314683 - Bring me down.<br />- You'll get yourself killed.
6322316 6324901 Bring it in low. Keep over the wing.
6332660 6334035 Lower.
6343546 6347549 John, what the fuck are you doin'<br />out on the wing of this plane?
6355057 6356433 Damn!
6363232 6365233 There's something wrong.
6365735 6368278 The ailerons. We can't take off.
6374452 6376202 It's McClane again.
6376871 6378538 Son of a bitch!
6380082 6383543 - I'll do him.<br />- This time, do it right.
6383627 6386796 Just get us in the air, General.<br />You're the only man who can do it.
6386881 6389716 Don't shoot. That wing is fully fuelled.
6441811 6444813 Too bad, McClane. I kinda liked you.
6452404 6454280 I got enough friends.
6492862 6494821 Time for the main event.

6682259 6685636 Look! I see it.
6711288 6714040 They used the fuckin' fire to see.
6714124 6716542 They can all do that. Let's tell 'em.
6716627 6719712 They already know. Listen.
6719797 6724300 <i>They're using the fire trail as a guide.</i><br /><i>If they can do it, so can we.</i>
6742820 6746114 Any landing you can walk<br />away from is a good one.
6817311 6819645 Holly!
6855891 6857433 Hi!
6867402 6870404 Oh, God. Oh, baby.
6870489 6872740 I thought I was never gonna see you again.
6872824 6875076 That's what I thought about you.
6875160 6877119 I love you so much.
6880958 6883751 They told me there were<br />terrorists at the airport.
6883835 6886003 Yeah. I heard that, too.
6894596 6896514 God, that's beautiful.
6899893 6901978 Yup. It sure is.
6904147 6906148 I love you so much.
