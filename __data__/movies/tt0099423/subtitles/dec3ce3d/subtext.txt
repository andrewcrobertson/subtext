146041 149670 Security was tight today at Escalon Airport<br />in the Republic of Val Verde...
149754 153924 where government authorities report<br />that deposed general Ramon Esperanza...
154008 157052 will be delivered for immediate extradition<br />to the United States.
157136 159054 Only two years ago,<br />General Esperanza...
159138 163392 led his country's army in a campaign<br />against communist insurgents...
163476 166270 A campaign fought with<br />American money and advisers.
166353 168355 Esperanza's fall from power<br />caused ripples...
168439 170357 not only in his country's<br />recent election...
170441 173319 but closer to home as well...

181285 183537 violated the neutrality<br />of neighboring countries...
183621 185790 made Congress withhold funds...
185873 188334 Funds which Esperanza<br />Is accused of replacing...
188417 191086 by going into the lucrative<br />business of cocaine smuggling.
191170 192797 - Although Esperanza was removed...
192880 194924 as commander in chief<br />earlier this year...
195007 198886 the agreement to extradite him<br />was not reached until yesterday.
198969 202431 And Washington insiders say<br />it was a phone call that made it happen...

398335 401130 Strangely, the deposed<br />dictator's mood seems jubilant.

1304824 1308703 So you capped some lowlife. Fine.
1308786 1312373 - I'll send your fuckin' captain<br />in L.A. a fuckin' commendation!<br />- [Alarm Buzzing I
1312457 1314709 In the meantime, you get<br />the hell out of my office...
1314792 1318630 before I have you thrown out<br />of my goddamn airport!
1318713 1320673 [Buzzing Stops I
1328848 1331184 Hey, Carmine, let me<br />ask you something.
1331267 1333186 What sets off the metal<br />detectors first?
1333269 1335897 The lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1335980 1337982 Fat fuck.
1347116 1349077 Any I.D. on this guy?
1349160 1351204 That's somebody else's problem. Wait here.
1353498 1356501 - Okay, your car's ready.<br />If you'd just sign right here—<br />- Hi.
1356584 1358878 - Hi.<br />- I need to borrow this and this.
1358962 1361089 - I'll bring it right back.<br />- Hey!
1362173 1364092 Hey! Yo! Hold up!
1365176 1367178 Yo!
1368554 1370473 Hold up, boys.<br />Hold up. Hold up.
1370556 1372476 - We gotta check something.<br />- What are you doing?
1372558 1374519 Pretty gruesome fuckin' job.
1374602 1378064 In all the confusion in there,<br />we forgot to get this clown's prints.
1378147 1380066 Believe that?
1381776 1385530 - Ew! Christ.<br />- Hey, you're supposed to do that at the morgue.
1385613 1389200 Not anymore. Got a new S.0.P.<br />for D.O.A.'s from the F.A A.
1392120 1395123 I don't think this one's<br />gonna make it, boys.
1395206 1397750 Thanks a lot.
1405338 1407423 There goes our escort.
1409926 1412386 It doesn't matter.<br />We're out of danger now.
1412428 1414847 We're safe all the way<br />to the United States.
1414889 1417350 How long?
1417391 1420061 3 1/2 hours.
1434033 1437829 These chains hurt!
1437870 1441541 Could you take these off, kid?
1441582 1443793 Where do you think I could go?
1443835 1447463 Sorry, General, I'm not<br />permitted to do that.
1448840 1451634 Good, kid, good.
1451676 1453678 You're an excellent soldier.
1456556 1460226 Instead of freedom,<br />give me a light.
1509195 1511155 Powell here.
1511239 1513783 Take that Twinkie out of your mouth<br />and grab a pencil, will ya?
1513866 1516536 Hey, John. How you doin'?
1516619 1521374 Holly stood me up a day,<br />and I'm here alone in D.C. with my in-laws.
1521457 1523918 Ah, the old in-laws, huh?
1524001 1526629 Man, they do love<br />their policemen son-in-laws, don't they?
1526712 1531592 Listen, Al, what is the fax machine<br />telephone number there at the station?
1531676 1534971 Uh, let's see.
1535054 1537056 555-3212.
1537140 1540601 3212.<br />Hold on a second, all right?
1540685 1543312 I wanna send you something here.<br />Excuse me.
1543396 1546274 You and faxes? This is a first.
1546357 1549652 Yeah, well, Holly told me I should<br />wake up and smell the "90s.
1549735 1552864 - This way?<br />- No. That way.
1552947 1555199 - Wait. It's upside down.<br />- It doesn't matter.
1555283 1557326 Okay. Here it comes.
1559412 1561873 I'm sending you<br />something right now.
1561956 1563958 Hold on a second, cowboy.
1576512 1579307 - Fingerprints?
1579390 1581517 Got an unidentified stiff here.
1581601 1584604 I've circled the whorls in pen<br />in case the transmission's a little fuzzy.
1584687 1587749 Listen, run it through state and federal,<br />and if you can, run it through Interpol.
1587773 1590109 Will do.<br />Well, what's this about?
1590193 1592695 - Oh, just a feeling I have.
1592778 1596157 Ouch. When you get those feelings,<br />insurance companies start to go bankrupt.
1596240 1599076 Listen, the, uh, fax number is...
1599160 1601621 Is on the top edge<br />of the transmission he just got.
1601704 1604123 Is on the top edge<br />of the transmission you just got.
1606959 1608961 Oh, an airport, huh?
1609045 1611190 Listen, you're not pissing<br />in somebody's pool, are you?
1611214 1614550 Yeah. And I'm fresh out of chlorine.
1621140 1623059 Just as this storm<br />starts breakin'.
1623142 1626646 The satellite feed up<br />and drops the other shoe on us.
1626729 1628648 Look at this new front movin' in.
1628731 1630650 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chickenshit.
1630733 1634904 - Well, I can sand down all the runways...
1634987 1636948 and keep the plows going<br />between landings...
1637031 1639659 but you gotta downshift them up there,<br />give me time to work.
1639742 1643246 You got it.<br />All right, everyone.
1643329 1646249 Let's call all our birds<br />and slow ‘em down...
1646332 1648709 before we get a parking lot<br />over our heads.
1648793 1651087 The line starts<br />at the Mississippi...
1651170 1653339 and they better start<br />takin' numbers.
1662265 1664183 Can I get you another?
1665393 1668646 - No, thank you.
1668729 1671691 I only have to look at his face for another<br />15 or 20 minutes.
1673776 1675776 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />this is the captain speaking.
1675820 1678447 I've just been informed<br />by Dulles Traffic Control.
1678531 1680950 That there's a weather front<br />moving in ahead of us.
1681033 1684662 We may be up here<br />a little while longer.
1684745 1686664 Thank you.
1686747 1688749 On second thought...
1694130 1695965 - Al?
1696048 1698134 Hey, I'm right here, partner.
1698217 1700928 Your stiff's dossier is<br />coming through right now.
1702263 1704473 - What can you tell me about him?
1704557 1707685 - He's dead.<br />- You needed a computer to figure that one out?
1707768 1710354 No, no, no, no.<br />You don't follow me.
1710438 1713858 According to the Department of Defense,<br />he's been dead for two years.
1713941 1718195 - What?<br />- That's right. “Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.
1718279 1723617 American adviser in Honduras.<br />Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.”
1723701 1726495 - Officer?<br />- [ Fax Beeps I
1726579 1730291 Read between the lines, and I'd say it<br />looks like a lot of black-bag stuff to me.
1730374 1732960 Yeah, I see it.<br />All right, Al. Thanks a lot.
1733044 1735296 - Hey, anytime.<br />- Okay.
1737381 1739300 Say, I close in about an hour.
1739383 1741302 Maybe we can go get a drink?
1744263 1746932 Just the fax, ma'am.<br />Just the fax.
1748809 1750954 Sam, if you're<br />desperate, get some airport personnel...
1750978 1752897 - man-on-the-street stuff<br />- Hey, wait a second.
1752980 1755107 I see somebody.<br />I'll call you back, okay? Hold on.
1755191 1757777 I'll call you from London. Bye.
1760946 1762865 The Ghost of Christmas Past.
1762948 1766035 Nakatomi? L.A.?<br />You're John McClane, right?
1766118 1768245 - Who are you?<br />- Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
1768329 1770790 - Excuse me.<br />- Hey, come on.
1770873 1772958 Give me a break.<br />I saw the stiff.
1773042 1775461 Word is, that was your handiwork.
1775544 1778089 No. I only do needlepoint.
1783260 1787014 Great. National just shut down.<br />Totally iced.
1787098 1790559 - They're gonna be sending us their planes.<br />- Happy, happy holidays.
1790643 1792812 The worst part, Mr. Trudeau, was the press.
1792895 1795207 Oh, they were here anyways,<br />crawlin' all over the Esperanza story...
1795231 1797149 so they got it right<br />on the fuckin' news.
1797233 1799151 You know, bloodstains and all.
1799235 1802613 Personally, I'd like to lock every<br />damn reporter out of the airport...
1802696 1805199 but then they'd just pull<br />that freedom-of-speech crap on us.
1805282 1807201 Then the A.C.L.U.<br />would be all over us.
1807284 1809203 Murder on television.
1809286 1811372 Hell of a start<br />for Christmas week.
1812665 1815084 What is it?<br />A gang thing like last time?
1815167 1818003 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1819422 1821173 - Who the hell is this?<br />- Uh-uh, McClane.
1821257 1824093 - I'm a police officer.<br />- In an unauthorized area.
1824176 1826178 L.A., Mr. Trudeau,<br />don't mean shit.
1826262 1829014 Yeah? That's what<br />I said about my last cholesterol test.
1830349 1832726 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1834186 1836439 I'm sure Captain Lorenzo<br />has explained to you...
1836522 1838899 the minor little fracas<br />with the minor little thieves.
1838983 1841694 Maybe he can explain this.
1860045 1862840 - All systems tapped, Colonel.<br />- Fire it up.
1878063 1880149 “H” minus five minutes.
1880232 1882651 Stand by.
1882735 1886864 All right. We've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1886947 1889492 Assuming it's not a computer error,<br />what do we assume?
1889575 1891911 That somebody's about<br />to seriously fuck with this airport.
1891994 1895664 What the hell is that supposed to mean? I<br />mean, I know we're dummies up here, McClane...
1895748 1897917 so give us a taste<br />of your brilliant genius.
1898000 1901146 - I mean, you're talkin' about a hijacking,<br />a robbery or what?<br />- Look, I'm not sure.
1901170 1905549 Oh, he's not sure.<br />Well, 'm stunned. I gotta lie down.
1905633 1907944 The only people that go to this<br />much trouble are professionals...
1907968 1910328 - not luggage thieves and not punks.<br />- Professional at what?
1910387 1913849 What the fuck do you think this is, huh?<br />The safety patrol here?
1913933 1915935 This is the résumé<br />of a professional mercenary.
1916018 1919873 You got the world's biggest drug dealer on his way<br />here. You need a slide rule to figure this out?
1919897 1922900 Or maybe another body in a zipper bag<br />before you start asking questions?
1922983 1926362 Hey, pal, you're the one that gave us<br />that fuckin' body. Remember that.
1926445 1928948 Yeah, I remember that.
1934954 1937498 Lorenzo, have all your<br />shift commanders report in.
1937581 1940376 - Now.<br />- What? You're not buyin' into this?
1940459 1944046 I want them to report anything out of the<br />ordinary, no matter how trivial. You got that?
1944129 1946340 - Yeah, I got it.<br />- Oh, my God!
1946423 1947675 - What?
1947758 1949677 - The runways. Look.<br />- Son of a bitch!
1949760 1952555 - What the hell?<br />- They're shutting down.
1952638 1954682 Jesus Christ.
1959895 1962898 Go to emergency lighting now.
1962982 1965234 Emergency. We are in a code yellow.
1965317 1968362 - Backup systems won't come up.<br />- Shunt to another terminal.
1968445 1972032 - Bobby, what do you got?<br />- Nothing. The whole network is down.
1972116 1973909 Maybe we should call<br />the power company, huh?
1973993 1975828 We're on the same goddamn grid,<br />and we're hot.
1975911 1978080 Dulles, what's going on? I'm on approach.
1978163 1981292 - Maintain position. Repeat.<br />- What's going on down there?
1981375 1984062 - Roger. We're on it.<br />- Western, we're unable right now. Please delay.
1984086 1988632 Fuji 604, execute published<br />missed-approach procedure and hold.
1988716 1991760 T.W.A. 23, unable to clear you<br />for approach at this time.
1991844 1994054 Climb to and maintain<br />one zero thousand.
1994138 1997308 I've checked all systems.<br />It ain't happenin'!
2010195 2013091 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you. The<br />problem's all over the airport. No lights.
2013115 2015784 - What's it look like?<br />- Approach control— it's gone.
2015868 2017870 Jesus. Instrument<br />landing system is down.
2020080 2022291 Confirmed. I.L.S. is dead.
2022374 2025919 Every goddamn system's dead,<br />and NMAC monitors are down.
2031717 2033719 Attention all controllers. Attention.
2033802 2037848 We have a code-red alert.<br />Every aircraft approaching our sector...
2037931 2040017 who are not already<br />in our landing pattern...
2040100 2042269 gets diverted<br />to their alternate airport now.
2042353 2047107 Everyone already on approach<br />or inside our pattern...
2047191 2049568 holds at the outer markers.
2049652 2052946 Stack 'em, pack 'em<br />and rack 'em. Move.
2053947 2056909 - Get someone on it!
2059370 2061997 All right. Not a word<br />of this leaves this room.
2062081 2064166 There must be 15,000 people<br />in this airport...
2064249 2066835 and we don't need panic<br />on our hands.
2066919 2068962 We just bought ourselves<br />maybe two hours.
2069046 2072925 After that, those planes low on fuel<br />aren't gonna be circling.
2073008 2075761 They're gonna be droppin'<br />on the White House lawn.
2077471 2080891 McClane, this what you expected?
2080974 2082935 No.
2084478 2086438 This is just the beginning.
2090567 2093696 - F.AA. hotline.<br />- How could they know already?
2093779 2096865 - They can't.
2096949 2100994 - Maybe it's the boys that pulled all your plugs.<br />- Put it on speaker.
2102579 2105457 Attention, Dulles Tower. Attention.
2105541 2108627 They say that blind men become<br />very attentive by way of compensation.
2108711 2110629 Now that you're both<br />blind and deaf...
2110713 2113757 I think I've got your attention.
2113841 2117511 I'm aware your recorders<br />are active, so I'll be quick.
2117594 2119680 You can play me back later<br />to your heart's content.
2119763 2122266 How did you get on this line?<br />Who is this?
2122349 2126311 - Who I am is unimportant. What I want...
2127980 2130834 Well, if you don't want those planes<br />to start splashing into the Potomac...
2130858 2133402 as they run out of fuel,<br />what I want is very important.
2133485 2137030 A plane will be landing<br />at this airport in 58 minutes.
2137114 2140409 It is FM-1,<br />Foreign Military One.
2140492 2142286 Now, I'm sure you gentlemen<br />are well aware...
2142369 2144389 - of the unique nature of this flight...<br />- Esperanza?
2144413 2146874 And the importance of its cargo.
2146957 2151253 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2151336 2153922 It will land on a runway<br />of my designation...
2154006 2156842 where it will remain<br />isolated and unapproached.
2156925 2161221 That will conclude my interest in this<br />aircraft and your responsibility for it.
2161305 2166435 At the same time, I want<br />a 747 cargo conversion...
2166518 2169897 fully fueled and placed at my disposal.
2169980 2171899 You have two more minutes<br />to advise...
2171982 2174985 your inbound aircraft<br />to hold at their outer radio marker.
2175068 2177946 After that, you will be<br />able to receive only.
2178030 2182659 Any attempt to restore your systems<br />will be met by severe penalties.
2182743 2186497 - He's bluffing.<br />- Damn it, you can't do this.
2186580 2188665 I am doing this.
2195923 2199259 Okay, you guys, listen up.<br />I need you to punch up a code 15.
2199343 2201261 I got an idea,<br />and I need your help.
2201386 2203764 If Esperanza gets on that plane<br />and makes it to a country...
2203847 2205766 that has no extradition<br />treaties, we're fucked.
2205849 2209019 They're talking to us on our own<br />goddamn system. They gotta be close.
2209102 2211104 I'll have my men tear<br />this airport apart.
2211188 2213106 Just in the nick of time, huh?
2213190 2216068 Hey, McClane, I got a first-class<br />unit here— SWAT team and all.
2216151 2218213 - We don't need any<br />Monday-morning quarterbacks.<br />- Fuck Monday morning.
2218237 2220906 My wife's on one of the goddamn planes<br />these guys are fucking with.
2220989 2224743 That puts me on the playing field. If you'd<br />have moved your fat ass when I told you to...
2224827 2226745 we wouldn't be hip deep<br />in shit right now.
2226829 2228807 - That's it. Security. You're out of here.<br />- Mr. Trudeau...
2228831 2231959 Mr. Trudeau, do I have to remind you<br />about F.A.A. regulations...
2232042 2234628 regarding unauthorized personnel<br />in the control tower?
2234711 2236755 All we have to do is find<br />a way to transmit.
2236839 2239651 Yeah, right. Somebody wanna run down<br />to Radio Shack and get a transmitter?
2239675 2242678 We already have one.<br />The new terminal wing they're building...
2242761 2245639 20 airlines when it's done,<br />all with their own reservation computers...
2245722 2247558 all tied in to a nice<br />big antenna array.
2247641 2250102 - Better see Mr. McClane out.<br />- Get your fuckin' hands off me!
2250185 2252455 - You got no business being up here.<br />- I'm telling you guys.
2252479 2254565 Everything we need<br />is over by the annex skywalk...
2254648 2257568 - just sitting there, waiting to go on line.<br />- The annex skywalk?
2257651 2259987 Goddamn it, Trudeau.<br />You're dealin' with pros here.
2260070 2262614 You can't fuck with these people!<br />Listen to me!
2262698 2266052 Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau, there<br />are a lot of rumors flying around here today.
2266076 2268453 No way. No way, lady.<br />Hell, no. No.
2268537 2270706 This is off limits, Coleman.<br />You know that.
2270789 2272708 Get them out of here.
2272791 2274751 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of too!
2274835 2276753 Get your fucking hands off me.
2276837 2279089 For shit's sake, just<br />get ‘em both out of here!
2280465 2283093 Lobby Security, come in.
2283176 2285113 - Tomlinson here.<br />- This is Captain Lorenzo here...
2285137 2287217 with two unauthorized personnel<br />in the fucking tower.
2287264 2289308 Now, would you<br />get your thumb out of your ass...
2289391 2291310 get 'em out of the elevator...
2291393 2293830 or you're gonna find a goddamn pink slip<br />in your Christmas stocking.
2293854 2295856 10-4. Let's go.
2295939 2298567 Goddamn!
2298650 2302654 - Anything who can think of?<br />Can't fuck with what guy?<br />- Shit. Hang on over there.
2302738 2304323 - What for?<br />- Just hang on.
2306408 2309453 Big drug dealer on his way to prison,<br />gunfight at airport...
2309536 2312056 every controller in the coffee shop<br />getting beeped and hauling ass...
2312080 2313999 and you rocking the boat.
2314082 2316043 Connection? Come on, McClane.<br />Just a few words.
2316126 2318045 Okay, just a few words.<br />Fuck off.
2318128 2321340 Thanks, but I already got<br />that from Colonel Stuart.
2323008 2327220 Stuart. The guy that got canned<br />by Congress. That's who he was.
2327304 2329932 - Huh? Who he who? What? Hey!<br />- Shh!
2330015 2333185 It's okay.<br />I've done this before.
2342986 2345197 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2345280 2347366 - Where's the other one?<br />- Claustrophobic, I guess.
2349910 2353205 It's a VHF system, but the planes<br />are so close it doesn't matter.
2353288 2356833 I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,<br />wire in a crossover, and we're hot.
2356917 2358835 Even the planes wouldn't<br />know the difference.
2358919 2361797 Get what you need.<br />Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2361880 2364299 I want my SWAT team<br />to go with him as cover.
2364383 2367010 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of too.
2372432 2375268 Oh, man. I can't<br />fuckin' believe this.
2375352 2377980 Another basement.<br />Another elevator.
2378063 2380899 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?
2402838 2404756 What the fuck?
2439541 2442044 Who are you?
2442127 2445839 I'm Marvin.<br />Marvin. I'm Marvin.
2445922 2448592 I thought you was tryin'<br />to steal my records, that's all.
2449634 2452471 I'm just the janitor.
2458101 2462272 This is Dulles Approach<br />to all aircraft holding at Potomac VORTAC.
2462355 2465192 We are experiencing<br />some technical problems here.
2465275 2467295 The weather conditions,<br />which have been deteriorating all day...
2467319 2471823 have now been complicated by, uh—<br />By an unforeseen human factor.
2471907 2475619 This has affected all<br />of our electronic equipment...
2475702 2477788 and their redundant backups<br />as well.
2477871 2481583 As a result, our nav<br />and approach systems are down...
2481666 2484169 and we expect to lose voice<br />in another minute.
2484252 2488507 We want you to continue<br />holding at the outer marker as directed...
2488590 2490592 and wait for further instructions.
2490675 2492719 As soon as we're back on line...
2492803 2496014 we'll expedite your landings<br />on a fuel-emergency basis.
2497724 2499726 Good luck.
2501103 2503063 God bless.
2508735 2511696 All right.<br />Change the boards.
2538140 2540058 Okay, stand back.
2540142 2542727 - The skywalk annex.<br />- No, goddamn it. The annex skywalk.
2542811 2546249 Listen to me. The annex skywalk. It's the<br />last thing I heard before they kicked me out.
2546273 2548316 Well, let me see here now.
2548400 2550402 Well, this must be it<br />right there.
2550485 2555240 See? That's the raised platform,<br />and there's the new terminal.
2555323 2558201 There's your skywalk.
2558285 2560245 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2561788 2564875 What's the fastest way you can<br />get me out to that spot?
2568378 2570797 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2570881 2572966 Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.<br />We'll watch your back.
2573049 2574968 Yeah? Who watches yours?
2586938 2591484 Main ventilation duct.<br />Main ventilation duct.
2591568 2593486 And bingo.
2593570 2598450 Just once,<br />I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.
2599910 2604414 Eggnog, a fuckin'<br />Christmas tree...
2604497 2607876 a little turkey.
2607959 2612172 But no, I gotta crawl around in<br />this motherfucking tin can.
2617510 2619763 We're in the annex skywalk.<br />I can see the array.
2619846 2622849 I'll give you a call for a protocol test<br />as soon as it's hot.
2622933 2626686 That's all for now. Sergeant, we may<br />need some more equipment.
2626770 2630607 - I'd like to send one of your guys back for it.<br />- Right, sir. You got it.
2632859 2635612 What the hell's goin' on?
2635695 2637822 Hey! Put that back on!
2639366 2642619 Hey, asshole,<br />what do I look like to you?
2642702 2645121 Assitting duck.
2646039 2647958 Take him!
2649584 2652754 - Shit!
2652837 2655507 Damn it.<br />I hate it when I'm right.
2659636 2661638 Look out!<br />Get down!
2669646 2671982 Keep your head down!
2681533 2684327 You son of a bitch!
2761363 2764115 Stay down!
2776795 2778755 Fuck!
2778838 2781257 Motherfucker!
2787263 2789516 Come on.<br />Come on.
2809536 2812288 Fucking son of a bitch!
2818503 2820338 [ Screams I
2828847 2832225 - Shit.<br />- [ Gasping I
2835311 2837522 Fuck.
2840608 2843653 I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.
2876811 2879898 - Geez<br />- You all right?
2879981 2883902 Yeah. Yeah. But the antenna array—<br />I gotta get to it and set it up.
2888823 2891075 Get down!
2908384 2911554 Goddamn.
2913473 2916100 Bait.
2917018 2919979 Jerk us off...
2920063 2922273 make Lorenzo sacrifice<br />his best men.
2926528 2928571 Make you waste your time...
2931574 2933493 Time we don't have.
2947966 2950593 I think you're closer<br />than 50 yards.
2950677 2953596 So's that airplane.<br />Practically.
2953680 2956057 Yeah. There's quite a<br />few of them out there.
2956140 2958059 It looks like<br />a regular traffic jam.
2958142 2960186 There's nothing<br />regular about it.
2960270 2964524 See? You're intrigued.<br />That's my gift, Mrs. McClane.
2964607 2967443 I notice things—<br />Things other people wouldn't see.
2967527 2970405 That's how I make<br />people curious.
2970488 2972323 Don't you mean nauseous?
2972407 2976869 Look. The people have a right to know<br />everything about everybody.
2976953 2978913 You got in the way of that.
2978997 2981833 Listen, buster, you<br />endangered my children...
2981916 2985461 and you didn't do it<br />for anything as noble as the people.
2985545 2987463 The only time you even<br />see the people...
2987547 2990341 is when you look down<br />to see what it is you're stepping on.
2995054 2997140 Me? Yeah, I'll live...
2997223 2999434 but Lorenzo's SWAT team<br />Is dead...
2999517 3001436 and the antenna array is— is gone.
3001519 3005523 - Didn't you see it?
3005607 3007859 I'm tired of looking for a new miracle.
3009777 3011821 Just hold a minute. No, I'll be right back.
3011904 3015116 - Just hold for a second.<br />Something's going on here.
3015199 3016993 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Just hold on for a minute.
3017076 3020246 I say again, Annex Team,<br />give us a sit rep.
3021873 3024083 Annex Team, come in.<br />Do you copy?
3025627 3029672 It's got some kind of scramble on it.<br />Can you do anything with it?
3029756 3034927 - No. This scramble mode must<br />activate on this code panel.
3035011 3038097 Even if we scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in.
3038181 3040221 - These guys are pros.<br />- So are you. Break the code.
3040266 3042560 I wanna hear what these bastards<br />are sayin' to each other.
3042644 3045146 This is a 10-digit control panel,<br />six-digit readout.
3045229 3047815 Hell that could be<br />a million combinations.
3047899 3050401 Next time you kill<br />one of these guys...
3050485 3053112 - get him to enter the code first.<br />- Yeah.
3055073 3057742 Sir, we just monitored a call<br />from their chief engineer.
3057825 3060411 Our people took out<br />their SWAT team completely.
3060495 3063414 You were right. They went for the<br />antenna array. We're right on schedule.
3063498 3066459 Losing our own team<br />wasn't part of the plan.
3072048 3073966 Attention, Dulles Tower.
3074050 3077220 Attention, Dulles Control Tower.
3077303 3080765 Mr. Trudeau, I know you're listening.<br />Unfortunately, you're not obeying.
3080848 3082767 Try me face-to-face, and we'll see.
3082850 3084828 You were warned not to try<br />to restore your systems.
3084852 3088648 You've wasted lives and precious time<br />on a futile and obvious target
3088731 3091484 Now you're gonna<br />pay the penalty.
3091567 3095613 I got five dead officers down here,<br />Colonel Stuart. Isn't that penalty enough?
3095697 3098449 McClane, you keep out of this.<br />You've been nothing but a pain...
3100368 3104247 Oh, McClane.<br />John McClane.
3104330 3109585 The policeman hero who saved<br />the Nakatomi hostages.
3109669 3111587 I read about you<br />in People magazine.
3111671 3113840 You seemed out of your league<br />on Nightline, 1 thought.
3113923 3115842 Hey, Colonel, blow me.
3115925 3119303 How much drug money<br />is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
3119387 3123266 I think Cardinal Richelieu said it best.<br />“Treason is merely a matter of dates.”
3123349 3127395 This country's got to learn<br />that it can't keep cutting the legs off...
3127478 3129480 of men like General Esperanza...
3129564 3133443 men who have the guts to stand up<br />against communist aggression.
3134569 3136571 And lesson one starts<br />with killing policemen?
3136654 3140575 What's lesson two—<br />The neutron bomb?
3140658 3143286 No. I think we can find<br />something in between.
3145913 3148207 Watch this.
3148291 3152545 Give me a flight number,<br />one that's low on fuel.
3152628 3154756 Windsor 114.<br />Transatlantic from London.
3154839 3157842 Fuel tank's dry as a martini.
3157925 3162013 Activate the I.L.S. landing system,<br />but recalibrate sea level...
3163681 3165725 minus 200 feet.
3189749 3191667 Oh, Jesus!
3191751 3194629 They've reset<br />ground level minus 200 feet.
3194712 3199425 Windsor Flight 114.<br />This is Dulles Approach. Do you copy?
3199509 3203638 Dulles Approach, this is Windsor 114.<br />Where the devil have you been?
3203721 3208309 Windsor 114. Dulles Approach.<br />We've been right here all along, old buddy.
3208392 3210895 Our systems only came back<br />on line just this very second.
3210978 3213481 Windsor 114...
3213564 3217735 you are cleared for I.L.S. approach,<br />runway two-niner.
3217819 3219819 Contact Dulles Tower frequency<br />at the outer marker.
3219862 3222156 Jesus Christ!<br />He's gonna crash the fuckin' plane!
3222240 3226953 Roger, Approach, and about time. I've got<br />230 people up here flying on petrol fumes.
3227036 3231123 - Roger, 114. Understand.<br />Calibrate Dulles altimeter—<br />- Oh, Jesus.
3231207 3234752 - They'll fly right into the concrete.<br />- Son of a bitch!
3234836 3238297 - Why are they listening to him?<br />- It's our frequency! Why shouldn't they?
3238381 3241509 - Dulles, this is Windsor 114.<br />- Barnes!
3241592 3245179 This is Dulles Tower.<br />We have radar contact.
3245263 3247265 Give me your coat!
3248349 3250268 What are you gonna do?
3250351 3252770 Whatever I can.
3254814 3257024 - Ladlies and gentlemen...
3257108 3259211 as you've probably noticed,<br />we've started our descent.
3259235 3261153 We're sorry<br />for the inconvenience...
3261237 3263698 - but we'll all be on the<br />ground in a few minutes.
3263781 3266701 - Thank you.<br />- Please keep your seat belts on.
3266784 3269263 Oh, not to worry. We've made arrangements<br />for your next flight...
3269287 3271497 - SO you won't miss it, okay?<br />- Thank you.
3271581 3275626 In your seat, please.<br />Come on. In your seat.
3275710 3278713 Oh, hey.<br />We're just like British Rail, love.
3278796 3282133 We may be late, but we get you there.<br />Don't worry.
3298900 3299900 Good luck, McClane!
3299901 3300902 Good luck, McClane!
3323299 3327553 Dulles, this is Windsor 114,<br />inside the outer marker.
3327637 3330473 Roger, 114.<br />This is Dulles Tower.
3330556 3333017 We have radar contact<br />and show you on L.L.S.
3333100 3335353 You're in the glide path,<br />and you're looking good.
3344654 3346656 There's somebody out there!
3350660 3354205 It's McClane. Christ.
3357917 3361629 - Approach flaps.<br />- Approach flaps.
3361712 3364256 Approach speed, 140.
3364340 3366384 - Approach speed, 140.<br />- 130.
3366467 3369804 130.<br />Altitude 1,000 feet.
3369887 3371973 800, guys!<br />You're only at 800 feet!
3372056 3375351 Fire and Rescue, this is Cummings.<br />Roll everything out to runway two-niner!
3375434 3379981 Ref speed plus 20.600 feet.
3381190 3384110 Looking good, Windsor.<br />Now watch it.
3384193 3387113 30-knot crosswinds,<br />and the runway is icy.
3387196 3389115 Attaboy. We've got you.
3390408 3394453 - We've got you.
3403129 3406215 No! Pull up!
3407299 3409260 - Jesus!<br />- [ Screams I
3412471 3414557 [ All Screaming I
3421856 3425276 - We're gonna die!<br />- We've got you.
3449175 3451719 No.
3451802 3453804 God.
3458267 3460269 Motherfucker.
3463064 3465066 Motherfucker.
3467735 3469653 Oh, Jesus.
3481415 3484251 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3484335 3487296 If the 747 we requested<br />is ready on time...
3487379 3490132 and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested...
3490216 3492718 further lessons can be avoided.
3492802 3494720 Out.
3494804 3497848 God.
3518369 3520454 Come on, you guys!
3526168 3528087 Hurry! Hurry!
3528170 3530297 We need a truck over there!
3540474 3544228 We got no sign of survivors down here!<br />It's a goddamn nightmare!
3545771 3548440 Hey, Nelson!
3558409 3560744 Barnes!
3560828 3564707 We've gotta warn those planes there's a lunatic<br />down here who likes to pretend he's the tower.
3564790 3567293 - Get up to the cabin. Get me on the air.<br />- How?
3567376 3570254 - You figure it out!<br />- Here's the manifest.
3591275 3593694 McClane, I know<br />how you must feel.
3598199 3601285 I wanted to help<br />those people tonight.
3602661 3605956 I was pretty goddamn useless.
3608667 3611086 We called<br />the government for help.
3611170 3615007 They're gonna send in<br />a special army unit...
3615090 3617301 a counterterrorist team.
3624141 3628437 Your wife's plane?<br />Well, they're still broadcasting...
3628520 3631815 even though we can't answer.
3633025 3635986 They're gonna<br />run out of fuel in 90 minutes.
3647665 3651919 Listen, Dick.<br />That is your name— Dick.
3652002 3654964 If you're going to continue<br />to get this close...
3655047 3658592 do you think you might consider<br />switching aftershaves?
3658676 3660886 Anything else?
3660970 3664014 Stronger mouthwash<br />might be nice.
3664098 3666600 And here's Sam Coleman<br />reporting live from the site...
3666684 3668644 Well, Colonel...
3668727 3671605 they've done everything<br />we've anticipated... so far.
3671689 3674525 But still there has been<br />no official word from authorities.
3674608 3679029 Meanwhile, despite the fact that only one<br />runway has been closed due to the tragedy...
3679113 3683409 several dozen airliners are visible from<br />where I stand, endlessly circling the field.
3683492 3686036 Other reports say that<br />there was trouble in the tower...
3686120 3689415 before the crash and that that<br />may have even contributed to it.
3689498 3692084 One thing is certain—<br />With weather conditions worsening...
3692167 3695587 the problem here and in the sky above us<br />will continue to grow.
3695671 3699008 I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles<br />International Airport.
3706098 3708934 - Victor. Victor. Victor.<br />- Yeah, what's up?
3709018 3710936 Did you pack the radio<br />mikes from the shoot...
3711020 3713480 - or did you put them in your carry-on?<br />- Are you crazy?
3713564 3716108 - I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em in.<br />- I love you.
3716191 3718736 Give me one of the receivers.
3722197 3727119 - Can you tune in to the cockpit frequency?<br />- Yeah. Why?
3727202 3729204 I wanna hear what's goin' on.
3730998 3733417 - Should be right here on our band.
3733500 3737504 - Nothing.<br />- You just told me it would work.<br />Is it working or not?
3737588 3742134 It is working, but it's— All I'm<br />getting is some kind of airport beacon.
3742217 3746013 It's weird. It's like<br />the tower isn't there.
3748223 3750517 Stay on it.
3750601 3752644 Let me know when<br />there is something there.
3752728 3754938 Okay.
3792267 3795104 - Major Grant. We're Blue Light.<br />- Rollins, Department of Justice.
3795187 3797106 Trudeau, chief of air operations.
3797189 3799441 Lorenzo, terminal police.
3799525 3801443 You want something, you got it.
3801527 3804571 This is it?<br />One fucking platoon?
3804655 3808200 - One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?<br />- John McClane.
3808283 3812162 - McClane, you showed some balls out there, man.<br />- Yeah.
3812246 3816333 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3816417 3818961 Well, it looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3819044 3820963 Isn't Colonel Stuart<br />one of your men?
3821046 3824800 No, not anymore he's not.<br />Now we're here to take Colonel Stuart down.
3824883 3827136 And we will take him down.
3827219 3830431 You see, I served with him.<br />I taught him everything he knows.
3830514 3834309 Well, maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3834393 3836812 Let's hustle!
3836895 3840107 Command post will be set up<br />in the airport police station.
3840190 3843110 I want to be tied in to the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3843193 3845195 Allright, let's do it!
3846321 3848323 Hey, Trudeau.
3850617 3852619 Things just get better or worse?
3856623 3858542 Lights— big, portable lights.
3858625 3862337 - We set up the field, and then—<br />- We wait for those lunatics to shoot 'em out?
3862421 3865108 And where do we get those big,<br />portable lights— borrow them from Batman?
3865132 3867050 What about the air phone idea?
3867134 3869970 There's 18 planes up there.<br />Only five of them have those phones.
3870053 3872431 We got through to three.<br />We're still trying on the others.
3872514 3875326 That leaves 13 accidents waiting to happen.<br />Are they still bucking headwinds?
3875350 3878496 I just checked the weather. Headwinds are<br />slamming everybody over the outer marker.
3878520 3880731 The planes with enough fuel<br />have already been...
3880814 3882454 shunted to Atlanta,<br />Memphis and Nashville.
3882566 3885027 Outer marker.
3885110 3888947 Damn!<br />The outer marker!
3889031 3891450 It's a beacon, right?<br />A radio beacon that sends out...
3891533 3893845 this “beep, beep, beep”<br />so they know they're over it, right?
3893869 3897247 - 50?<br />- So who says that radio signal has to just beep?
3897331 3901084 Right. We switch the frequency from<br />the tower over to the one in the beacon.
3901168 3903921 - We pump up the wattage.<br />- And we can talk to our planes...
3904004 3906089 and those bastards<br />who did this will never know!
3908634 3911637 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3911720 3914389 They've been tapped<br />into your tower chatter all night.
3914473 3916517 Punks stealin' luggage,<br />huh, Carmine?
3920145 3922564 - How you doing, Telford?<br />- No good.
3922648 3925067 I called Langley.<br />They're rigging a portable decoder.
3925150 3928070 - It'll be here in two hours.<br />- My wife doesn't have two hours.
3928153 3930572 I was only transferred<br />to Grant's team yesterday.
3930656 3932574 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3932658 3936912 - Word is, nobody's better at this than Major Grant.<br />- Attention!
3936995 3939623 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3939706 3942876 I want to hear about the plane<br />those bastards asked for.
3942960 3946088 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.<br />Pilots' briefing room. Now.
3946171 3948090 - Keep working.<br />- Albertson!
3948173 3950175 - Sir!<br />- With me.
3950259 3952261 Yes, sir!
3954888 3956974 No civilians.
3967568 3969486 What the fuck?
3969570 3971613 What is it?
3971697 3973615 The outer marker beeper.
3973699 3976326 It isn't beeping.<br />It's talking.
3976410 3979079 Attention all aircraft in<br />Dulles landing pattern.
3979162 3981248 This is Chief Engineer<br />Leslie Barnes.
3981331 3984084 I have been authorized<br />to brief you in full.
3984167 3988589 At this time, this is the only<br />channel available to us.
3988672 3991091 Here is the situation.
3991174 3993427 Approximately two hours ago...
3995721 3997639 Wait till you get a load of this.
3997723 4000434 Do not accept any instructions<br />claiming to be from our tower...
4000517 4003770 unless you hear your own<br />flight recorder access code.
4003854 4006940 - The terrorists have got all our systems...<br />- Holy shit! Get this on tape.
4007024 4009002 And now have control of everything<br />except this channel.
4009026 4010986 Give us a second here, please.
4011069 4013614 This channel is secure,<br />but your own transmissions are not.
4013697 4015616 Do not, repeat...
4015699 4019786 do not attempt to reply on your own<br />frequencies to this broadcast.
4019870 4021955 These people have already<br />caused one crash...
4022039 4024207 - by impersonating our tower.<br />- Jesus.
4035218 4037220 Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...
4037304 4040057 the two systems that can<br />allow you to land...
4040140 4042059 Field lights for a visual landing...
4042142 4044061 and the L.L.S. for an instrument.
4044144 4046063 A special U.S. Army unit<br />is already here...
4046146 4048440 and preparing to take out<br />the terrorists.
4048523 4050859 - My God.<br />- Don't accept any instructions...
4050942 4053570 - Yo, Marvin.<br />- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?
4053654 4056156 No. It never looked<br />good on me anyway. Come here.
4056239 4059469 Listen, you gotta get me up to the pilots'<br />briefing room. They're havin' a little soiree.
4059493 4062871 I gotta hear what they're sayin' even<br />if I gotta put a fuckin' glass to the door.
4062954 4065582 - Which one of these maps gets me in there?<br />- Don't touch it!
4065666 4069020 - Find the map, Marvin.<br />- I'll find it. You'll mess up my<br />whole damn filing system here.
4069044 4071922 Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.<br />I think that's in the main terminal.
4072005 4075801 So would that be under<br />“P” for “pilots' briefing room”?
4075884 4079846 - Now, Marvin.<br />- Or maybe it would be under “M”<br />for “miscellaneous.”
4084518 4087270 - Oh, shit!<br />- This is Garber.<br />Request permission to reduce...
4087437 4088980 sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.
4089064 4091233 My men are getting cold.<br />They're getting antsy. Over.
4091316 4095076 This is Colonel Stuart. Garber, please have the<br />men not on watch assemble for a briefing. Over.
4095112 4097280 Roger, Colonel. Over and out.
4097364 4100033 - What's the matter?
4100117 4105497 Gentlemen, tonight<br />the pattern ends.
4105580 4109292 The dominoes will fall no more,<br />and the ramparts will remain upright.
4109376 4112796 - Sir, General Esperanza's plane<br />just came on the scope.
4119344 4121346 - Tracking.<br />- Attention, Dulles Tower.
4121430 4123682 We will be lighting up a runway.
4123765 4127310 Do not, repeat, do not<br />attempt to land any planes.
4127394 4130313 Remember, we're monitoring you.
4133191 4136903 - What do we do?<br />- Obey.
4143034 4145620 Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.
4145704 4148498 Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.
4148582 4151877 This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.<br />We read you. Over.
4151960 4157841 Foxtrot Michael One, you are to come in<br />on runway 1-5, repeat, 1-5.
4171730 4175776 I found it on the floor, by the coat,<br />next to the luggage belt.
4175859 4177778 What the hell you so excited<br />about that for?
4177861 4179821 The code's still punched<br />into this one.
4179905 4183492 You like it, huh?<br />How about you give me 20 bucks for it?
4183575 4185827 How about I let you live?
4187370 4189498 Man knows how to bargain.
4189623 4191958 This is contrary to our instructions.
4192042 4194878 We are to land at runway 1-0...
4194961 4198799 where we are to be met<br />by representatives of your Justice De...
4198882 4203345 Captain, please tell the tower<br />you will proceed as ordered.
4214314 4216566 Roger, Dulles.
4216650 4219277 Proceeding to runway 1-5.
4235168 4237254 Foxtrot Michael One,<br />come in, please.
4238880 4240799 What are you going to do now?
4240882 4243218 You going to shoot me?<br />So who will fly the plane?
4243301 4246596 Don't worry about it.<br />It's not your problem.
4253228 4254771 Michael One, do you copy?
4258733 4261194 Foxtrot Michael One,<br />come in, please.
4270495 4273290 Eagle Nest.<br />This is Falcon. Mayday.
4273373 4276334 Eagle Nest. This is Falcon.<br />Mayday!
4278128 4283008 - Go ahead, Falcon.<br />- I've lost cabin pressure. Near zero visibility.
4283091 4285969 I must drop out of this<br />weather and land now...
4286052 4287971 on the first accessible runway.
4288054 4292350 Repeat. I've lost cabin pressure.<br />Near zero visibility.
4292434 4294394 I must drop out of the storm.
4294477 4296730 I can land, but I must land now...
4296813 4298940 on the first outgoing runway.
4299024 4303361 Repeat. I cannot circle<br />around to runway 1-5.
4306323 4308241 I'll make you a deal, Marvin.
4308325 4310243 You show me a shortcut<br />out to those runways...
4310327 4312245 and I'll get you<br />a liner for that coat.
4312329 4315540 Repeat. I cannot circle around<br />to runway 1-5.
4315624 4317834 Shit.<br />Stand by, Falcon.
4319836 4322547 Here, sir. He's coming in<br />from the ocean, sir.
4324841 4327260 A bullet has damaged my instruments.
4327344 4329262 I'm not sure of my bearing...
4329346 4331723 and I must make<br />a visual landing immediately.
4331806 4334643 - Do you copy, Eagle Nest?<br />- Roger, Falcon.
4334726 4338772 - That would be 2-5 right, repeat, 2-5 right.<br />- What?
4338855 4342108 Make up your fucking mind!
4342192 4345153 Oh, we are just up to our ass<br />in terrorists again, John.
4345236 4348198 - 2-5 left.<br />- Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.
4348281 4350659 2-5 right
4350742 4353036 I gotta quit smoking cigarettes.
4353119 4355330 Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.
4355413 4359376 But if you could show it to me as well,<br />I would be grateful.
4370095 4372389 I see the lights.
4372472 4375308 They are directly in front of me.<br />Gracias, compadre.
4375392 4378311 Reducing airspeed.<br />Approaching runway.
4378395 4381439 - Wish me luck.<br />- Roger, Falcon.
4382565 4385026 We copy. We'll have you<br />in five minutes.
4385110 4388238 That's right, asshole.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4411886 4415473 I see your lights. E.T.A. 90 seconds.
4424399 4426943 Come to papa, scumbag.
4482165 4484751 Oh, shit!
4542851 4544853 Freedom.
4546604 4549732 - Not yet.<br />- [Gun Cocks I
4549816 4553153 You're supposed to stay in your seat<br />until the plane reaches the terminal.
4553236 4555530 No frequent-flier mileage for you.
4555613 4557907 - Who are you?<br />- A cop.
4557991 4561327 - A cop?<br />- Yeah, one of the good guys.<br />You're one of the bad guys.
4561411 4564539 And now that I got your sorry ass,<br />I'm gonna trade it for my wife.
4573923 4576259 Sit down!
4578428 4580305 - I'm goin' in!<br />- I got you covered.
4586144 4587937 - Where'd he go?<br />- In there.
4597238 4600783 [ Esperanza I I don't believe<br />this. Two months of planning...
4600867 4603203 and you can't anticipate one<br />pendejo ofa cop.
4603286 4605446 - Come on, General.<br />- Where the hell is Colonel Stuart?
4609375 4611586 - General!<br />- Lam all right.
4611669 4613713 He said he was a policeman.
4613796 4615715 I thought you had this place secured.
4615798 4617800 He went in the cockpit.
4617884 4621095 He's goin' to hell!<br />McClane!
4622555 4624807 I assume it's you, McClane.
4624891 4627769 You're quite a little soldier.
4627852 4631522 You can consider this<br />a military funeral!
4647121 4649332 [ Screams I
4654545 4656881 How many grenades we got?
4656965 4660301 - Three each!<br />- Use'em!
4670061 4673189 Oh, fuck.
4673273 4675984 Oh! Sh...
4686661 4689247 Go!
4704429 4706431 Oh, shit!
4715315 4717275 You lucky fuck.
4720653 4724907 - Fire trucks, sir.<br />- Fall back to the church. Now!
4746888 4748931 Where's the fucking door?
4762820 4766157 They're getting a little<br />nervous back there. In fact, so am I.
4766240 4768159 We're right over Washington.
4768242 4770661 See if you can get any TV.<br />That'll settle 'em down.
4770745 4773623 Works for me. I'll...
4796813 4800233 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the Video Sleaze Awards?
4800316 4803277 - Try Pulitzer.<br />- Ladies and gentlemen...
4803361 4807156 while waiting to land, our cabin attendants<br />are turning on local Washington broadcasting.
4807240 4809158 The sound is on channel three.
4815832 4818501 Okay. Okay. Okay.
4826008 4829679 - Please, sir, we may land at any moment.
4829762 4831681 - If you'll take your seat—<br />- I'm gonna be sick.
4831764 4833683 Excuse me. I'm gonna be sick.
4833766 4835852 Sir, the seat belt light is on.
4839814 4841190 Moron.
4841274 4843192 - WZDC.<br />- Yes, this is Richard Thornberg.
4843276 4845194 Put me through to Ruben in the newsroom.
4845278 4847780 - He's about to go live.<br />- I know he's about to go on.
4847864 4850283 - That's why I need him.<br />- You'll have to hold on...
4850366 4853536 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your résumé.
4853619 4856205 Esperanza's down.
4856289 4860126 But he's hurt.<br />He took a round in his shoulder.
4860209 4862128 Plus I got one more of their guys.
4862211 4864130 That's six they lost altogether.
4864213 4867175 Maybe if we knew how many they<br />had to start with, we could get excited...
4867258 4870970 but if they got 50 guys, it's a little<br />early to break out the champagne!
4871053 4875016 We appreciate your effort, McClane, but we<br />don't need a loose cannon on this deck!
4875099 4878269 What if they decide to crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your little stunt?
4878352 4880771 They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?
4880855 4883649 Besides, if I grabbed<br />Esperanza, this would all be over by now.
4883733 4886402 Well, maybe they're just<br />a little bit more creative than you think!
4886486 4888738 Well, at least<br />I'm thinking, goddamn it!
4888821 4891324 Listen, you wiseass, we're here to jerk off<br />that cocksucker...
4891407 4893534 until he tries to take off— period!
4893618 4896746 Now, you're the wrong guy<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time!
4898331 4901751 The story of my life.
4901834 4905296 Major, Pentagon<br />Situation Room, sir!
4905379 4908508 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.<br />Thank you, Telford.
4908591 4911427 You men come with me.
4912845 4914764 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4914847 4918309 - You said those guys showed up<br />out there right away?<br />- Yeah.
4918392 4920811 So— So that must mean<br />they're on the field or close.
4920895 4923314 And I think I know where.
4923397 4925399 Come here. Let me<br />show you something.
4927777 4931781 These are the old plans when the longer<br />runways went in. That's— That's 12 years ago.
4931864 4934951 Looks like they've done<br />some modifications on-site...
4935034 4938329 Moved TRACON phones, I.L.S.,<br />all the underground stuff...
4938412 4940331 so they could handle drainage.
4940414 4943834 If I'm right, all of it would run right<br />along the airport property...
4943918 4947129 and go right past<br />this neighborhood.
4949840 4951884 We should have been<br />on the ground two hours ago!
4951968 4953886 I understand,<br />but if you just relax a little...
4953970 4957515 - Come on, lady. Who you tryin' to kid?<br />- It's hopeless.
4957598 4961143 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess. That's for sure.
4961227 4964855 Well, unfortunately, there really isn't<br />anyone we can blame for the weather.
4964939 4967858 Oh, yeah? What about<br />that porker Willard Scott?
4967942 4969860 I should have taken the bus.
4969944 4973072 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4973155 4976033 - Excuse me.<br />- Yes?
4976117 4978035 I was just wondering.
4978119 4982415 Um, this flight originally was supposed<br />to be five and a half hours, right?
4982498 4986210 - Mm-hmm.<br />- Do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this?
4986294 4990339 Oh, of course.<br />They anticipate little problems like this.
5007940 5010526 Barnes, we looked at 12 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
5010610 5013446 This is our last possibility.
5013529 5015615 Over here there's an old church.
5015698 5017366 Let's go.
5021954 5023956 Wait.
5030338 5032465 There's the church over there.
5039972 5043851 - Could be a sentry.<br />- And he could just be out for a walk.
5043934 5046395 Then why is he going over<br />his own footsteps?
5048981 5051233 Come on.
5052902 5056238 All right. Just stay here and get<br />ready to call the marines.
5056322 5060660 - I thought they were the army.<br />- Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
5076676 5079011 - [Pager Beeping I<br />- Oh, shit.
5079095 5081222 Not now.
5095403 5097446 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5097530 5099573 Barnes, where the hell did you go?<br />Where's McClane?
5099657 5103178 He's with me. We're at the Highland Lake<br />Community Church on the west side of the airport.
5103202 5106372 You're where? Goddamn it!<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't...
5106455 5110042 This must be their base of operations. Shut<br />up and get your ass over here! Move it!
5110126 5112211 Code red! Sit rep.
5112294 5115256 We got positive I.D.<br />on Stuart's location. Let's move.
5115339 5117341 - Yo!<br />- Yes, sir.
5127643 5130271 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
5132398 5134650 If there are no more surprises.
5149331 5151834 Gentlemen, we have a situation here.
5200007 5202009 [ Screams I
5228994 5231247 Over here.
5243592 5246345 Geez, McClane, you all right?<br />You want a medic?
5246428 5249598 McClane, what the hell you think<br />you're doing out there, playing John Wayne?
5249682 5251934 How would you like<br />to spend the night in a cell?
5252017 5255521 Lorenzo, shut the fuck up and do something<br />useful. Go seal off the street.
5255604 5257690 Hey, you can't<br />talk to me like that.
5257773 5262903 Oh, no, Carmine? Sergeant, get this<br />bureaucrat out of Mr. McClane's face now.
5262987 5264905 With pleasure, sir.
5266615 5270369 Major, the men are in position, sir.
5270452 5272538 Close up the back.<br />Then we go in.
5272621 5274999 - Fire only on my order.<br />- Roger that, sir.
5275082 5277001 Guess I was wrong about you.
5277084 5279587 You're not such<br />an asshole after all.
5279670 5283257 No, you were right.<br />I'm just your kind of asshole.
5291599 5294310 Garber, sit rep!
5294393 5298272 Army Special Forces on three sides,<br />closing in fast around the back!
5298355 5301775 - Another problem, Colonel?<br />- No problem, General.
5301859 5304862 Gentlemen, you know what to do.
5315623 5317958 - [Gunshots I<br />- Down!<br />- Get down! Get down!
5345861 5349615 General, it's time.
5355871 5358874 Come on. Let's move it!
5372930 5375015 - They're pulling out!<br />- What?
5375099 5377101 Out the back!
5384024 5386026 Move it!
5395369 5397871 Albertson, take your men<br />around the back.
5423355 5426025 This equipment—<br />It could land our planes.
5426108 5428878 Don't touch anything. There were trip wires<br />outside. They could have booby-trapped...
5428902 5432573 - They did.<br />- Got one here. Looks like C-4.<br />The motherfucker is armed.
5432656 5435951 Clear the area!<br />Everybody, now!
5438537 5440456 They booby-trapped<br />all the equipment.
5440539 5442458 - Seal off the building!<br />- Shit!
5442541 5445461 Secure the area.<br />Post sentries. No civilians allowed.
5445544 5449006 Hey, where the fuck is McClane?
5497846 5500682 Miller, take him!
5500766 5503894 I'll cover you!
5526375 5528544 Goddamn!
5549565 5554486 So much for the element of chance.<br />Let's move out.
5572004 5574006 I had the bastard in my sights.
5574089 5576091 I know I did.
5584433 5587644 Oh. Oh, Jesus Christ.
5592774 5595360 Attention, Tower. Attention, Dulles Tower.
5595444 5597988 This is Colonel Stuart.<br />Is our plane prepared?
5598071 5599990 It is.<br />It's in Hangar 11.
5600073 5602326 It's the most<br />remote building we've got.
5603535 5605454 We're on our way.
5605537 5608999 Have a ground crew there<br />to confirm the condition of the plane.
5609082 5612002 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5612085 5615839 Colonel, you're quite capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5615923 5618926 Now, please, don't ask us<br />to gift wrap potential hostages for you.
5619009 5620928 Major Grant, isn't it?
5621011 5624848 If you remember me, Colonel, then you<br />remember I know the drill as well as you do.
5626016 5628060 Check out<br />your own fucking plane.
5628143 5632481 We move out in five minutes.<br />Flak jackets for everybody.
5632564 5634566 Body armor for the assault team.
5634650 5637319 Night scopes for the snipers.
5637402 5640030 We will take them in the hangar,<br />and I will pull that detonator...
5640113 5643659 out of Stuart's dead<br />fucking hand myself.
5643742 5646536 - Lorenzo, take all your men back to the airport.<br />- Sir.
5646620 5650207 Seal off every exit in case any of 'em<br />tries to slip past us...
5650290 5653168 - to break out onto the ground.<br />- You got it.
5654962 5658173 All right, here we go.
5658340 5661176 Dick, this is nuts. Every station<br />in town has people at the airport...
5661260 5663500 and none has heard<br />a whisper of this shit you're running!
5663553 5666181 Well, none of them is me.<br />You want proof? Try this.
5666265 5669726 Repeat. Terrorists<br />have murdered civilians...
5669810 5672854 and cut off the two systems<br />that can allow you to land.
5672938 5674982 A special U.S. Army unit<br />is already here...
5675065 5677385 - and preparing to take out the terrorists.<br />- Jesus Christ.
5677442 5679486 I want you to go live now.
5679569 5681649 Key me in from the files—<br />A publicity shot, whatever.
5681697 5683740 Connie's got one. And a map—<br />Steal one from weather.
5683824 5685993 We're on it. We're cutting<br />in five minutes!
5686076 5690497 Tell the affiliates if they want in, they<br />got three minutes to shout. Let's do this.
5690580 5693166 Network, here I come.
5696211 5700716 Hey, Telford, what was your chickenshit<br />outfit doing while we were taking Grenada?
5703677 5707848 Grenada— five minutes<br />of firefight, five weeks of surfing.
5707931 5709975 I wish I was with you guys for that.
5710058 5712019 Yeah. Me too, kid.
5712102 5715314 - Really, sir?<br />- Sure.
5715397 5718066 Then we wouldn't<br />have to do this.
5733457 5736001 Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.
5736084 5740172 On schedule and in position.
5740255 5742549 Roger, Hatchling.<br />We are secure here.
5742632 5748430 You have a green light.<br />I repeat, a green light.
5759149 5763028 Jesus, Officer, where'd you come from,<br />Pearl Harbor?
5767199 5770577 All right, let's clear it out, please.
5771620 5776208 Stand by. Five, four, three...
5776291 5779920 This is a special bulletin from WZDC News.
5780003 5782506 There was a plane crash<br />earlier this evening at Dulles...
5782589 5784591 where other aircraft<br />continue to circle...
5784674 5787052 with no explanation from<br />airport or F.A.A. officials.
5787135 5790347 - Shh! Quiet!<br />- And now, with an exclusive WZDC report...
5790430 5792974 here's Dick Thornberg reporting<br />from the skies over Washington.
5793058 5796061 - Can you turn it up?<br />- I'm one of the thousand people...
5796144 5798188 who has been circling<br />our nation's capital...
5798271 5802943 under the assumption that whatever problem<br />was going on far below was a normal one.
5803026 5804986 But the truth is far from normal.
5805070 5807280 The truth is terrifying.
5807364 5810575 Look out!<br />Lady, look out!
5810659 5813995 Look out! Look out!<br />Look out! Look out! Get out of the way!
5814079 5816039 Ho! Get out of the way!
5816123 5820043 - Move! Get out of the way, lady! Go! Go! Hey! Hey!<br />- Look out!
5820127 5822045 This is a recording<br />of a conversation...
5822129 5825298 between Dulles Tower<br />and the captive aircraft overhead.
5827592 5830303 - Hey! Get out of the way!
5830387 5834182 - Lorenzo! Lorenzo!<br />- McClane, are you out of your fucking mind?
5834266 5836184 The Blue Light Team,<br />where are they?
5836268 5838955 Stuart's got explosives on the equipment<br />in the church rigged with a remote.
5838979 5842107 - Where's Grant?<br />- Grant's boys are gonna kill<br />that son of a bitch and get it.
5842190 5846194 - They're gonna get on the plane<br />and take off with him!<br />- Get the fuck out of here!
5846278 5849281 When the army canned Stuart, he must<br />have loaded that unit with his own men!
5849364 5852617 - Are you nuts? That firefight—<br />- Sideshow to jerk us off, buy 'em some time.
5852701 5854786 McClane, you are completely<br />around the fucking bend.
5854870 5856704 - You know that?<br />You know what else? You're under arrest.<br />- You motherfucker!
5856705 5859705 - You know that?<br />You know what else? You're under arrest.<br />- You motherfucker!
5864045 5866965 Here! These are the bullets<br />they used out there tonight!
5867048 5869092 Blanks!
5870552 5873096 Jesus Christ.
5880812 5882772 This is Chief Lorenzo.
5882856 5885984 I want every officer recalled and assembled<br />in body armor and full weaponry...
5886067 5888278 in the motor pool<br />in five minutes.
5891031 5893408 It's time to kick ass.
5895160 5897537 Just like Iwo Jima!
5897621 5900832 Since then, this reporter<br />has learned that the terrorists...
5900916 5902918 have virtual control<br />of the entire airport...
5903001 5906087 A fact that the authorities<br />have repressed,
5906171 5908340 The terrorists<br />promise more bloodshed...
5908423 5910383 unless their demands are met.
5910467 5913970 And now that the special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport...
5914054 5918642 the likelihood of a full-scale and<br />deadly battle is dangerously close.
5939871 5942958 That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.
5943041 5944960 It's all over the airport.
5945043 5947128 300 people have died.
5947212 5949714 - When are we going to land?<br />- I have no information.
5949798 5953051 And unfortunately they may not be the last.
5953134 5955720 The horrifying fact<br />is that no one is safe...
5955804 5959766 either in the planes above Dulles<br />or in the terminal below.
5959849 5962811 The threat of a new and higher<br />body count at the airport...
5962894 5965146 hangs over the heads of everyone...
5965230 5969609 and the holiday season<br />of peace and love has become a nightmare.
5975448 5977367 All right, listen up!
5977450 5981413 All units, I want you<br />to converge on Hangar 11, all sides!
5981496 5983498 This car, McClane! Get in!
5983582 5987919 When the city blue show up with their<br />backup, they'll pick up the pieces!
5988003 5989963 Now, move out!
5990046 5994009 McClane, say hi<br />to my brother Vito.
5994092 5997262 - Merry Christmas.<br />- Hi.
6000932 6003643 Shit!
6003727 6007772 - Goddamn it to hell! Move that piece of shit!<br />- What's the matter with you?
6007856 6009774 I didn't even see you, man.
6009858 6012193 Will you move that goddamn<br />piece of shit out of here!
6012277 6016448 Vito, get the fuck out of the car and get your<br />ass in gear and help me, for Christ's sake!
6016531 6020410 Will you get—<br />Move that car back right now, lady!
6020493 6023747 - Right there. Right there. Get that.<br />- Hey, Coleman!
6023830 6027917 Sam! Sam Coleman!
6028001 6031671 - Hey, Coleman!<br />- Hi!
6031755 6034174 Coleman!
6034257 6037969 But at least the truth<br />is not among the hostages...
6038053 6042974 because I, Richard Thornberg,<br />just happened to be here...
6043058 6045810 to put his life and talent...
6045894 6048772 on the line for humanity<br />and country.
6048855 6050899 And if this should be<br />my final broadcast...
6054110 6057989 Amen to that... Dick.
6058073 6059991 Dick? We're live, Dick.
6060075 6064746 Where are you now?<br />Dick?
6064871 6067582 Truck lights approaching, sir.
6067666 6070001 They're here, right on schedule.
6070085 6073963 The hangar door,<br />open it. Clockwork.
6097987 6101866 Geez, you give me this story,<br />and I'll have your baby.
6101950 6103993 Not the kind of ride<br />I'm looking for.
6115588 6119008 Colonel, if I may say so,<br />you are some piece of work.
6119092 6122345 Thank you, Major.<br />You're not so bad yourself.
6122429 6124347 Congratulations<br />on your escape, Sir.
6124431 6127976 Thank you, Major. Maybe you should<br />save them until we are all safe, hmm?
6128059 6130353 - Sir.<br />- My congratulations, gentlemen.
6130437 6133523 You've won a victory<br />for our way of life...
6133606 6137402 my pride, my admiration<br />and a kick-ass vacation.
6137485 6139654 Now get on board.
6169684 6172324 - What's the matter, cowboy, ride too rough?<br />- I don't like to fly.
6172395 6174981 - Then what are you doing here?<br />- I don't like to lose either.
6175064 6178276 Okay! Whoo! Here we go!
6186451 6190580 I don't know about you guys, but I've seen<br />enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime.
6190663 6192707 They don't get much of that<br />in the tropics, Major.
6192791 6196711 - For you, gentlemen, we'll import it.
6198505 6201216 Shit! They left the hangar!
6202967 6206346 Right there. Right there.<br />Get that.
6206429 6208807 - All right, now what?<br />- Get in front of them! Take it down!
6208890 6210850 Block their path<br />so they can't get out of there!
6210934 6214979 I'm not playing chicken with a 200-ton plane!<br />I'm crazy, but I ain't that crazy. Forget it.
6215063 6216648 Dulles, this is Northeast 140.
6216731 6219126 - Request clearance on first available runway.<br />- That's Holly's plane.
6219150 6221820 Repeat. Request<br />emergency clearance.
6221903 6224072 I know you're not gonna answer,<br />but you better listen!
6224155 6226157 We're down to fumes,<br />and we have to land...
6226241 6228993 and in five minutes<br />we're coming in one way or another.
6229077 6231746 Goddamn it. That's my wife's plane!<br />Take it fucking down!
6231830 6234457 I'm not gettin'<br />in front of that plane!
6238253 6240797 All right, how about<br />getting over top of it?
6240880 6243591 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />this is the captain. Your attention.
6243675 6247011 We have no choice<br />but to attempt an emergency landing.
6247095 6249514 Please fasten your seat belts<br />and assume crash positions...
6249597 6252016 as instructed by your cabin attendants.
6252100 6254519 Let's have the emergency checklist.
6254602 6258565 Attention all air traffic on this frequency<br />in Dulles area. This is Northeast 140.
6258648 6261442 We're going to attempt<br />an emergency landing. Be advised.
6263403 6267156 I don't want to die. I don't want to die.<br />I don't want to die.
6267240 6269993 - Just buckle your seat belt.<br />- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
6270076 6273663 You're gonna be all right.<br />Lean forward now. Thank you.
6273746 6278126 God! Oh!
6280795 6282797 Oh, God.
6283965 6288177 Oh, God. Thy rod and<br />thy staff, they comfort me.
6294225 6297812 - Hang on! Hang on!<br />- What are you doing?
6297896 6299981 You wanted a story, didn't you?<br />Nice and easy, boys.
6300064 6302817 - Get me in low!<br />- You got it!
6304694 6307322 - Where are you going?<br />- Bring me down!
6307405 6310950 You'll get yourself killed!<br />Come back inside!
6317123 6319334 Bring it in low!<br />Keep over the wing!
6327717 6330178 Lower!
6338770 6342482 John, what the fuck are you doing<br />out on the wing of this plane?
6349405 6351991 Damn!
6356454 6358081 - Mierda.<br />- What?
