1207080 1208498 is going to get you a free lunch
1208582 1210000 or something around here?
1210584 1213212 Well... maybe a little<br />professional courtesy.
1213253 1215714 Huh! In an airport on Christmas Week?
1215756 1217382 You've got to be kidding.
1217424 1218508 Okay. Fuck courtesy.
1218550 1220219 How about just being professional?
1220260 1222804 Your boys just walked away<br />from a crime scene, Captain.
1222888 1225307 You can't wrap this thing<br />up in 10 minutes and you know it.
1225390 1227309 You got to seal the area off,<br />take pictures, dust for prints.
1227392 1229853 Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.
1229895 1231313 I know what I'm doing.
1231355 1233023 We're going to dust it down.
1233065 1235400 We'll take all the pictures.<br />We'll sweep for fibers.
1235442 1236777 When are you going to do this?
1236818 1238445 After 300 or 400 people go through?
1238487 1239821 You'd be lucky to get a print
1239863 1240948 from one of your own people.
1240989 1242324 Just shut down that area and--
1242366 1243992 Oh, just shut the area down.
1244034 1246411 It's that simple, huh?<br />Just shut the area down?
1246453 1248789 Yeah, and I got everybody
1248830 1250332 from the Shriners' convention
1250374 1253126 to goddamn Boy Scouts<br />traipsing through here!
1253168 1255212 I got lost kids, lost dogs--
1255254 1256338 Not now! Later!
1256338 1258465 I got international diplomats.
1258507 1261677 I got a fuckin' reindeer flying in here
1261718 1263345 from the fuckin' petting zoo!
1263345 1265722 But John McClane,<br />he's got a little problem.
1265764 1268475 Hell, let's shut down<br />the whole fuckin' airport!
1268517 1271520 What do you think they're going<br />to say upstairs when I tell them that?
1271561 1273105 Pick up the phone and find out.
1273146 1275232 Because I don't need fuckin' forensics
1275274 1276566 to tell me all this was
1276608 1278151 was some punk stealing luggage!
1278193 1280696 Luggage? That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.
1280779 1281738 You know what that is?
1281822 1283323 It's a porcelain gun made in Germany.
1283407 1284366 It doesn't show up
1284366 1285575 on your airport X-ray machines
1285617 1287411 and costs more than you make in a month.
1287452 1289871 You'd be surprised what I make in a month.
1289913 1291873 If it's more than $1.98,<br />I'd be very surprised.
1291915 1293834 Hey, McClane, don't start believing
1293875 1295085 your own press, huh?
1295127 1296962 Yeah, yeah, I know all about you
1297004 1298672 and that Nakatomi thing in L.A.,
1298714 1301091 but just because the TV<br />thinks you're hot shit,
1301133 1302301 that don't make it so.
1302342 1305470 Look, you are in my little pond now,
1305512 1308974 and I am the big fish that runs it.
1309016 1312686 So you capped some lowlife. Fine.
1312728 1314980 I'll send your fuckin' captain in L.A.
1315022 1316523 a fuckin' commendation!
1316565 1318692 In the meantime, get the hell<br />out of my office
1318734 1321653 before I have you thrown<br />out of my goddamn airport!
1332164 1334541 Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.
1334583 1337210 What sets off the metal detectors first--
1337252 1340630 the lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1340672 1342174 Fat fuck.
1351600 1353101 Any I.D. on this guy?
1353143 1354644 That's somebody else's problem.
1357731 1360150 Your car's ready. Sign right here.
1360192 1363236 I need to borrow this and this.
1363278 1365072 -I'll bring it right back.<br />-Hey!
1366156 1367824 Hey! Yo! Hold up!
1368867 1369910 Yo!
1371912 1373955 Hold up, boys. Hold up. Hold up.
1373997 1375165 We got to check something.
1375207 1376458 What are you doing?
1376500 1377793 Pretty gruesome fuckin' job.
1377834 1380212 All the confusion in there,
1380253 1382005 forgot to get this clown's prints.
1382047 1384049 Can you believe that?
1386426 1387552 Ew! Christ.
1387636 1389262 Hey, you're supposed<br />to do that at the morgue.
1389346 1390430 Not anymore.
1390514 1392974 Got a new SOP for DOAs from the FAA.
1396269 1398814 Ha ha! I don't think this one's<br />going to make it, boys.
1399231 1400315 Thanks a lot.
1409032 1411118 There goes our escort.
1413620 1416081 It doesn't matter.<br />We're out of danger now.
1416123 1418542 We're safe all the way<br />to the United States.
1418583 1421044 How long?
1421086 1423755 3 1/2 hours.
1435934 1437686 Ahh.
1437727 1441523 These chains hurt!
1441565 1445235 Could you take these off, kid?
1445277 1447529 Where do you thnk I could go?
1447529 1451158 Sorry, General,<br />I'm not permitted to do that.
1452534 1455328 Good, kid, good.
1455370 1457372 You're an excellent soldier.
1460250 1463920 Instead of freedom, give me a light.
1510467 1511635 (ring)
1513970 1515180 Powell here.
1515222 1516681 Take that Twinkie out of your mouth
1516723 1518308 and grab a pencil, will ya?
1518350 1520727 Ha ha! Hey, John, how are you doing?
1520769 1521937 Holly stood me up a day,
1522020 1525148 and I'm here alone in D.C.<br />with my in-laws.
1526024 1527692 Eh, the old in-laws, huh?
1527734 1530487 Man, they do love their policemen<br />son-in-laws, don't they?
1530904 1533698 Listen, Al, what is the fax machine<br />telephone number
1533782 1535075 there at the station?
1535450 1536618 Uh...
1539412 1541164 555-3212.
1541206 1544000 3212. Hold on a second, all right?
1544042 1545877 I want to send you something.
1545919 1547379 Excuse me.
1547420 1550006 AL: You and faxes? This is a first.
1550048 1551299 Yeah, well, Holly told me
1551341 1554010 I should wake up and smell the nineties.
1554052 1555178 This way?
1555220 1556846 No. That way.
1556888 1557973 Wait. It's upside-down.
1558014 1559099 It doesn't matter.
1559140 1560642 Okay. Here it comes.
1563395 1565730 I'm sending you something right now.
1565772 1566982 Hold on a second, cowboy.
1581454 1583748 -(beep)<br />-Fingerprints?
1583790 1585584 JOHN: We've got<br />an unidentified stiff here.
1585625 1587168 I've circled the whorls in pen
1587210 1588837 in case the transmission's a little fuzzy.
1588878 1590338 Listen, run it through state and federal,
1590380 1591715 and if you can, run it through Interpol.
1591756 1594092 Will do. Well, what's this about?
1594134 1595468 Oh, just a feeling I have.
1596344 1598471 Ouch. When you get those feelings,
1598555 1600265 insurance companies start to go bankrupt.
1600348 1602642 Listen, the, uh, fax number is...
1602809 1604769 is on the top edge of the transmission...
1604811 1606313 Is on the top edge
1606354 1607731 of the transmission you just got.
1610442 1612152 Oh, an airport, huh?
1612527 1615155 Listen, you're not pissing<br />in somebody's pool, are you?
1615196 1616865 Ha ha. Yeah.
1616906 1618575 And I'm fresh out of chlorine.
1624956 1627083 Just as this storm starts breaking,
1627125 1630420 the satellite will feed up<br />and drop the other shoe.
1630462 1632339 Look at this new front moving in.
1632380 1634924 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chicken shit.
1636343 1638261 Well, I can sand down all the runways
1638303 1640930 and keep the plows going between landings,
1640972 1642557 but you got to downshift them up there,
1642599 1644684 -give me time to work.<br />-You got it.
1646019 1647520 All right, everyone.
1648229 1650357 Let's call all our birds<br />and slow them down
1650398 1652150 before we get a parking lot<br />over our heads.
1652692 1654402 The line starts at the Mississippi,
1654444 1656404 and they better start taking numbers.
1666539 1668083 Can I get you another?
1671628 1672587 No, thank you.
1672671 1673963 I only have to look at his face
1674047 1675715 for another 15 or 20 minutes.
1676925 1678468 <i>PILOT (on P.A.): Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
1678551 1679844 <i>this is the captain speaking.</i>
1679969 1682514 I've just been informed<br />by Dulles Traffic Control
1682639 1684891 that there's a weather front<br />moving in ahead of us.
1684974 1688019 We may be up here a little while longer.
1688144 1689437 Thank you.
1689854 1691648 On second thought...
1698113 1699989 -(ring)<br />-Al?
1700031 1701700 Hey, I'm right here, partner.
1701741 1704953 Your stiff's dossier is<br />coming through right now.
1706246 1708123 What can you tell me about him?
1708164 1709499 He's dead.
1709541 1712001 You needed a computer<br />to figure that one out?
1712043 1713670 No, no. You don't follow me.
1713712 1716089 According to the Department of Defense,
1716131 1717674 he's been dead for two years.
1717966 1719092 What?
1719175 1722053 That's right. Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.
1722220 1724180 American adviser in Honduras.
1724848 1727892 Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.
1728017 1729394 Officer.
1729811 1732188 Read between the lines,<br />and I'd say it looks
1732230 1733982 like a lot of black-bag stuff to me.
1734023 1735316 Yeah, I see it.
1735358 1736818 All right, Al. Thanks a lot.
1736818 1737902 Hey, anytime.
1737944 1739028 Okay.
1740864 1743283 Say, I close in about an hour.
1743324 1745326 Maybe we can go get a drink?
1747495 1749581 Just the fax, ma'am.
1749622 1751207 Just the fax.
1755837 1758298 Hey, wait a second. Wait. I see somebody.<br />Listen. I'll call you back.
1758381 1759424 Hey, hold on. Hold on.
1765013 1766890 The Ghost of Christmas Past.
1766931 1769476 Nakatomi? L.A.?<br />You're John McClane, right?
1769559 1770560 Who are you?
1770643 1772937 Sam Coleman. WNTW news.
1773313 1774731 Excuse me.
1774773 1777150 Hey, come on.<br />Give me a break. I saw the stiff.
1777192 1778902 Word is that was your handiwork.
1779319 1781571 No. I only do needlepoint.
1787327 1789537 Great. National just shut down.
1789579 1791039 Totally iced.
1791080 1792791 They're going to be<br />sending us their planes.
1792832 1794417 Happy, happy holiday.
1794501 1796419 The worst part, Mr. Trudeau,<br />was the press.
1796461 1797754 Oh, they were here anyways,
1797796 1799672 crawling all over the Esperanza story,
1799714 1801257 so they got it right on the fucking news.
1801299 1803051 You know, bloodstains and all.
1803092 1805261 Personally, I'd like<br />to lock every damn reporter
1805303 1807472 out of the airport,<br />but then they'd just pull
1807514 1809474 that freedom-of-speech crap on us.
1809516 1811226 Then the ACLU would be all over us.
1811267 1812769 Murder on television.
1812811 1815396 Hell of a start for Christmas week.
1816105 1819108 What is it? A gang thing like last time?
1819150 1821778 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1823404 1825198 -Who the hell is this?<br />-Uh-uh, McClane.
1825240 1827492 -I'm a police officer.<br />-In an unauthorized area.
1827534 1830203 L.A., Mr. Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1830245 1832997 That's what I said<br />about my last cholesterol test.
1834249 1836793 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1837836 1840255 I'm sure Captain Lorenzo<br />has explained to you
1840338 1843007 the minor little fracas<br />with the minor little thieves.
1843341 1844801 Maybe he can explain this.
1864279 1865947 All systems tapped, Colonel.
1865989 1867073 Fire it up.
1882255 1884424 H minus five minutes.
1884465 1885341 Stand by.
1886718 1889220 All right. We've got a body in the morgue
1889262 1890847 that seems to have died twice.
1890930 1893516 Assuming it's not a computer error,<br />what do we assume?
1893558 1895977 That somebody's about<br />to seriously fuck with this airport.
1895977 1897979 What is that supposed to mean?
1897979 1899689 I know we're dummies up here, McClane,
1899731 1902025 so give us a little taste<br />of your brilliant genius.
1902066 1904152 You mean you talking about a hijacking?<br />A robbery? What?
1904193 1906696 -Look, I'm not sure. I--<br />-Oh, he's not sure.
1906738 1909157 Well, I'm stunned. I got to lie down.
1909240 1911701 The only people that go<br />to this much trouble are professionals--
1911784 1913202 not luggage thieves and not punks.
1913286 1914329 Professional at what?
1914370 1916289 What the fuck do you think this is, huh,
1916331 1917874 the safety patrol here?
1917916 1920001 This is the résumé<br />of a professional mercenary.
1920001 1922253 You got the world's biggest<br />drug dealer on his way here.
1922295 1923838 You need a slide rule to figure this out,
1923880 1925673 or maybe another body in a zipper bag
1925715 1927175 before you start asking questions?
1927216 1929135 You're the one that gave us<br />that fucking body.
1929177 1930178 Remember that.
1930720 1931971 Yeah, I remember that.
1939145 1942440 Lorenzo, have all your shift<br />commanders report in. Now.
1942732 1944525 What? You're not buying into this?
1944567 1946194 I want them to report anything<br />out of the ordinary,
1946235 1948071 no matter how trivial. You got that?
1948112 1949322 Yeah, I got it.
1949364 1950573 Oh, my God!
1950615 1951824 What?
1951866 1953284 The runways.
1953326 1955078 What the hell?
1955119 1956537 They're shutting down.
1956579 1958414 Jesus Christ.
1963878 1965755 Go to emergency lighting now.
1966839 1969258 Emergency. We are in a code yellow.
1969300 1971219 Backup systems won't come up.
1971260 1972428 Shunt to another terminal.
1972470 1973888 Bobby, what do you got?
1973930 1975932 Nothing. The whole network is down.
1975974 1977892 Maybe we should call<br />the power company, huh?
1977934 1979852 We're on the same goddamn grid. We're hot.
1979894 1982105 <i>PILOT (on radio): Dulles, what's going on?</i>

1983314 1985149 <i>What's going on down there?</i>
1985191 1986442 Roger. We're on it.

2014595 2016222 Yeah, yeah, yeah...
2016264 2017557 What's it look like?
2017598 2019851 Approach control-- it's gone.
2019892 2022353 Jesus. Instrument Landing System is down.
2024313 2026315 Confirmed. ILS is dead.

2065646 2068191 There must be 15,000 people<br />in this airport,
2068232 2070860 and we don't need panic on our hands.
2070902 2073029 We just bought ourselves maybe two hours.
2073613 2077033 After that, those planes low on fuel<br />aren't going to be circling.
2077075 2079660 They're going to be dropping<br />on the white house lawn.
2081412 2084957 McClane, this what you expected?
2086459 2087335 No.
2088127 2090379 This is just the beginning.
2091756 2094509 (beeping)
2094550 2096052 FAA hot line.
2096260 2097720 How could they know already?
2097762 2099055 They can't.
2100932 2103059 Maybe it's the boys<br />that pulled all your plugs.
2103351 2105019 Put it on speaker.
2106604 2108064 <i>STEWART (on speaker):</i><br /><i>Attention, Dulles Tower.</i>
2108106 2110733 <i>Attention. They say that blind men</i>
2110775 2113194 become very attentive<br />by way of compensation.
2113236 2114654 Now that you're both blind and deaf,
2114695 2117073 I think I've got your attention.
2117115 2119325 I'm aware your recorders are active,
2119367 2121369 so I'll be quick.
2121410 2123704 You can play me back later<br />to your heart's content.
2123746 2126666 How did you get on this line? Who is this?
2126707 2129293 Who I am is unimportant.
2129335 2130962 What I want...
2131003 2132713 Well, if you don't want those planes
2132797 2134257 to start splashing into the Potomac
2134298 2135800 as they run out of fuel,
2135842 2137426 what I want is very important.
2137468 2139679 A plane will be landing at this airport
2139720 2141013 in 58 minutes.
2141556 2144433 It is FM-1-- Foreign Military 1.
2144475 2146686 <i>Now, I'm sure you gentlemen are well aware</i>
2146727 2148354 <i>-of the unique nature--</i><br />-Esperanza?
2148396 2149522 <i>...of this flight,</i>
2149564 2150898 <i>the importance of its cargo.</i>
2150940 2154026 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2155069 2157446 It will land on a runway<br />of my designation,
2157488 2160867 where it will remain<br />isolated and unapproached.
2160908 2163452 That will conclude my interest<br />in this aircraft
2163536 2165246 and your responsibility for it.
2165288 2169876 At the same time, I want<br />a 747 cargo conversion
2169917 2171544 fully fueled
2171586 2173337 <i>and placed at my disposal.</i>
2173379 2174964 <i>You have two more minutes</i>
2175047 2176674 <i>to advise your inbound aircraft</i>
2176757 2178593 <i>to hold at their outer radio marker.</i>
2178759 2181429 <i>After that, you will be able</i><br /><i>to receive only.</i>
2182013 2184056 <i>Any attempt to restore your systems</i>
2184098 2186684 <i>will be met by severe penalties.</i>
2186726 2188102 He's bluffing.
2189187 2190479 Damn it, you can't do this.
2190521 2193232 I am doing this.
2201115 2203576 Okay, you guys, listen up.<br />I need you to punch up a code 15.
2203659 2205286 I got an idea and I need your help.
2205286 2206996 If Esperanza gets on that plane
2207038 2209165 and makes it to a country<br />with no extradition treaties,
2209290 2210208 we're fucked.
2210249 2211876 They're talking to us on our own system.
2211959 2213127 They got to be close.
2213169 2215129 I'll have my men tear this airport apart.
2215171 2216923 Just in the nick of time, huh?
2216964 2219008 Hey, McClane,<br />I got a first-class unit here,
2219050 2221010 S.W.A.T. team and all. We don't need
2221052 2222511 any monday-morning quarterbacks.
2222553 2224347 My wife's on one of the goddamn planes
2224388 2225473 these guys are fucking with.
2225514 2227141 That puts me on the playing field.
2227183 2229310 If you'd have moved your<br />fat ass when I told you to,
2229310 2230770 we wouldn't be hip-deep in shit right now.
2230811 2232939 That's it. Security. You're out of here.
2232980 2235691 Mr. Trudeau, do I have to remind you<br />about FAA regulations
2235775 2237193 regarding unauthorized personnel
2237276 2238945 in the control tower?
2239028 2240780 All we have to do<br />is find a way to transmit.
2240947 2242990 Yeah, right. Somebody want<br />to run down to Radio Shack
2243032 2244659 -and get a transmitter?<br />-We already have one.
2244700 2246202 The new terminal wing they're building--
2246244 2247620 20 airlines when it's done,
2247662 2249372 all with their own reservation computers,
2249413 2251582 all tied in to a nice<br />big antenna arrangement.
2251624 2253542 You'd better see Mr. McClane out.
2253584 2255419 You got no business being up here.
2255461 2256629 I'm telling you guys.
2256712 2258547 Everything we need<br />is over by the Annex Skywalk
2258631 2260258 just sitting there, waiting to go on line.
2260341 2262385 -The Annex Skywalk?<br />-God damn it, Trudeau.
2262426 2264136 You're dealing with pros here.
2264178 2265888 You can't fuck with these people.<br />Listen to me.
2265930 2267640 Sam Coleman. WNTW news.
2267682 2269225 Mr. Trudeau, there are a lot of rumors
2269267 2270393 flying around here today.
2270434 2271852 No way. No way, lady.
2271894 2273020 Hell, no. No.
2273104 2274730 This is off limits, Coleman.<br />You know that.
2274772 2276524 Get them out of here.
2276565 2279193 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of, too!
2279235 2281153 Get your fucking hands off me.
2281195 2283406 For shit's sake.<br />Just get them both out of here.
2284615 2286284 Lobby security, come in.
2286409 2289078 -Tomalson here.<br /><i>-This is Captain Lorenzo here</i>
2289120 2291414 with two unauthorized personnel<br />in the fucking tower.
2291455 2293374 Now, would you get<br />your thumb out of your ass,
2293374 2294917 get them out of the elevator,
2294959 2296752 or you're going to find<br />a goddamn pink slip
2296794 2298879 -in your Christmas stocking.<br />-10-4. Let's go.
2300506 2301882 God damn!
2302633 2303884 Anything who can think of?
2303926 2305052 Can't fuck with what guy?
2305094 2306262 Shit. Hang on over there.
2306345 2307847 -What for?<br />-Just hang on.
2309807 2311726 Big drug dealer on his way to prison,
2311767 2313227 gunfight in airport,
2313269 2314812 every controller in the coffee shop
2314854 2316397 getting beeped and hauling ass,
2316480 2317690 and you rocking the boat.
2317773 2319191 Connection? Come on, McClane.
2319275 2320192 Just a few words.
2320276 2321944 Okay, just a few words. Fuck off.
2322486 2325072 Thanks, but I already got<br />that from Colonel Stuart.
2326532 2329452 Stuart. The guy that got<br />canned by Congress.
2329493 2330828 That's who he was.
2330870 2332913 Huh? Who he who? What? Hey!
2332955 2335666 Shh! It's okay. I've done this before.
2347136 2348387 -Hey.<br />-Hi.
2348846 2350181 Where's the other one?
2350222 2351766 Claustrophobic, I guess.
2353851 2356020 It's a VHF system,<br />but the planes are so close
2356062 2357271 it doesn't matter.
2357313 2359231 I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,
2359273 2360900 wire in a crossover, and we're hot.
2360941 2362902 Even the planes wouldn't<br />know the difference.
2362943 2365696 Get what you need. Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2365738 2368157 I want my S.W.A.T. team<br />to go with him as cover.
2368199 2370576 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of, too.
2376415 2378376 Oh, man. I can't fucking believe this.
2378417 2380836 Another basement. Another elevator.
2382046 2384673 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?

2525064 2527399 (telephone ringing)
2542748 2544333 Hey, stand back.
2544375 2545709 The Skywalk Annex.
2545751 2547044 No, God damn it. The Annex Skywalk.
2547086 2550214 It's the last thing I heard<br />before they kicked me out.
2550256 2552508 Well, let me see here, now.
2552550 2554426 Well, this must be it right there.
2554468 2557096 See? That's the raised platform,
2557137 2559265 and there's the new terminal.
2559306 2561058 There's your skywalk.
2561100 2564770 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2565729 2568774 What's the fastest way<br />you can get me out to that spot?
2571151 2574822 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2574863 2577449 Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.<br />We'll watch your back.
2577491 2579159 Yeah? Who watches yours?
2590546 2592506 Main ventilation duct.
2592548 2595175 Main ventilation duct.
2595217 2596802 And bingo.
2596844 2598470 Just once,
2598512 2601890 I'd like a regular, normal Christmas...
2603892 2607354 eggnog, a fucking Christmas tree,
2609106 2610107 a little turkey...
2610858 2613819 but, no, I got to crawl around
2613861 2616113 in this motherfucking tin can.
2620451 2623912 We're at the Annex Skywalk.<br />I can see the array.
2623954 2626832 I'll give you a call for a protocol test<br />as soon as it's hot.
2626874 2628208 That's all for now.
2628250 2630169 Sergeant, we need some more equipment.
2630210 2632421 I'd like to send one<br />of your guys back for it.
2632463 2634590 Right, sir. You got it.
2636175 2637801 What the hell?
2637843 2639720 What the hell's going on?
2639720 2643641 Hey! Put that back on!
2643682 2646727 Hey, asshole, what do I look like to you?
2646727 2648812 A sitting duck.
2650397 2651940 Take him!
2653942 2655569 Shit!
2656445 2659365 Damn it. I hate it when I'm right.
2663619 2665704 Look out! Get down!
2677508 2679635 Aah!
2695651 2697861 Aah!
2765554 2767389 Stay down!
2781028 2782946 Fuck!
2791455 2793248 Come on.
2813519 2816188 Fucking son of a bitch.
2822486 2824112 Aah!
2833080 2834164 Shit.
2834206 2836250 Ah. Oh.
2844633 2847219 I'm going to kick your fucking ass.
2881420 2882713 Jeez.
2882754 2883964 You all right?
2883964 2886466 Yeah. Yeah. But the antenna array--
2886550 2888260 I got to get to it and set it up.
2893265 2895058 Get down!
2913035 2915037 God damn.
2917581 2919458 Bait.
2921001 2922502 Jerk us off,
2922544 2926757 make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.
2929760 2931970 Make you waste your time...
2935432 2937017 Time we don't have.
2951406 2953575 I think you're closer than 50 yards.
2954493 2957037 So's that airplane. Practically.
2957079 2960040 Yeah. There's quite<br />a few of them out there.
2960040 2962042 It looks like a regular traffic jam.
2962084 2964169 There's nothing regular about it.
2964211 2966672 See? You're intrigued.
2966713 2968632 That's my gift, Mrs. McClane.
2968674 2969967 I notice things--
2970008 2971426 things other people wouldn't see.
2971468 2974513 That's how I make people curious.
2974554 2976223 Don't you mean nauseous?
2976264 2979101 Look. The people have a right to know
2979142 2980519 everything about everybody.
2980560 2982688 You got in the way of that.
2982729 2986108 Listen, buster, you<br />endangered my children,
2986149 2987401 and you didn't do it
2987442 2989403 for anything as noble as the people.
2989444 2991697 The only time you even see the people
2991738 2993323 is when you look down
2993365 2997119 to see what it is you're stepping on.
2998370 3000789 Me? Yeah, I'll live,
3000872 3002582 but Lorenzo's S.W.A.T. team is dead,
3002624 3005377 and the antenna array is gone.
3005419 3006294 (beeping)
3006378 3007796 Didn't you see it?
3009047 3010966 It's hard looking for a new miracle.
3013260 3014803 Just hold for a minute.
3014845 3016430 I'll be right back.
3016471 3018557 Just hold for a second.<br />Something's going on here.
3018598 3020976 Yeah. Just hold on for a minute.
3021018 3023353 I say again, annex team,<br />give us a sit rep.
3025188 3027357 Annex team, come in. Do you copy?
3029568 3031361 It's got some kind of scrambler on it.
3031403 3034656 Can you do anything with it?
3034698 3036450 No. This scramble mode
3036491 3037868 must activate on this code panel.
3037909 3039745 Even if we scan their frequency,
3039786 3040912 we can't listen in.
3040954 3043040 These guys are pros.
3043081 3044875 So are you. Break the code.
3044916 3046626 I want to hear what these bastards<br />are saying to each other.
3046668 3048128 This is a 10-digit control panel.
3048128 3049588 Six-digit read-out.
3049629 3051423 Hell, there could be<br />a million combinations.
3051465 3053508 Next time you kill one of these guys,
3053550 3055886 get him to enter the code first.
3055927 3057262 Yeah.
3057763 3059681 Sir, we just monitored a call
3059723 3061725 from their chief engineer.
3061767 3064394 Our people took out<br />their S.W.A.T. team completely.
3064436 3066855 You were right.<br />They went for the antenna array.
3066897 3068315 We're right on schedule.
3068356 3071985 Losing our own team<br />wasn't part of the plan.
3076490 3077991 Attention, Dulles Tower.
3078033 3079743 Attention, Dulles Control Tower.
3079785 3082329 Mr. Trudeau, I know you're listening.
3082996 3084664 Unfortunately, you're not obeying.
3084706 3086750 Try me face to face, and we'll see.
3086792 3088752 You were warned not to try<br />to restore your systems.
3088794 3090879 You've wasted lives and precious time
3090921 3092714 on a futile and obvious target.
3093340 3095467 Now you're going to pay the penalty.
3095509 3098303 I've got five dead officers<br />down here, Colonel Stuart.
3098345 3100180 Isn't that penalty enough?
3100222 3101473 McClane, you keep out of this.
3101515 3103809 You've been nothing but a pain--
3104810 3108814 Oh, McClane. John McClane.
3109231 3112651 The policeman hero who saved<br />the Nakatomi hostages.
3113693 3115654 I read about you in <i>People </i>magazine.
3115695 3117864 You seemed out of your league<br />on <i>Nightline, </i>I thought.
3117906 3119324 Hey, Colonel, blow me.
3119366 3120575 How much drug money
3120617 3122744 is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
3123078 3124913 Cardinal Richelieu said it best.
3124955 3128083 Treason is merely a matter of dates.
3128125 3129709 This country's got to learn
3129751 3131378 that it can't keep cutting the legs off
3131419 3133463 of men like General Esperanza,
3133505 3134965 men who have the guts to stand up
3135048 3136925 against communist aggression.
3138510 3140554 And lesson one starts<br />with killing policemen?
3140595 3142806 What's lesson two-- the neutron bomb?
3144474 3147185 No. I think we can find<br />something in between.
3150272 3151565 Watch this.
3152941 3155277 Give me a flight number,<br />one that's low on fuel.

3564727 3567063 We've got to warn those planes<br />there's a lunatic down here

3595383 3597176 McClane, I know how you must feel.
3602682 3604892 I wanted to help those people tonight.
3606811 3608271 I was pretty goddamn useless.
3613109 3615403 We called the government for help.
3615445 3617989 They're going to send in<br />a special army unit,
3619324 3620950 a counterterrorist team.
3628750 3629959 Your wife's plane?
3631085 3632920 Well, they're still broadcasting
3632962 3634255 even though we can't answer them.
3637342 3639510 They're going to run out<br />of fuel in 90 minutes.

3729475 3731060 Yeah. Why?
3731102 3732645 I want to hear what's going on.
3734814 3736858 Should be right here on our band.
3738901 3739777 Nothing.
3739861 3741779 You just told me it would work.<br />Is it working or not working?
3741863 3745116 It is working, but all I'm getting<br />is some kind of airport beacon.
3746117 3747285 It's weird.
3747535 3749287 It's like the tower isn't there.
3751873 3753249 Stay on it.
3754917 3756544 Let me know when there is something there.
3757044 3757962 Okay.

3820233 3823277 Yeah, well, it looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3823319 3824821 Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?
3824862 3826781 No, not anymore, he's not.
3826823 3828658 Now we're here to take<br />Colonel Stuart down.
3828699 3830993 And we will take him down.
3831035 3832370 You see, I served with him.
3832411 3834288 I taught him everything he knows.
3834330 3835706 Well, maybe he's learned
3835748 3837291 a few more things since then.
3839794 3841170 Let's hustle!
3841212 3842713 The command post will be set up
3842755 3844006 in the airport police station.
3844090 3845675 I want to be tied in to the tower

3847093 3848386 All right, let's do it!
3850471 3851764 Hey, Trudeau.
3853558 3855935 Did things just get better or worse?
3860356 3862316 Lights-- big, portable lights.
3862358 3864610 We set up the field, and then we--
3864652 3866445 we wait for those lunatics<br />to shoot them out.
3866487 3867989 And where do we get<br />those big, portable lights--
3868030 3869198 borrow them from Batman?
3869240 3870658 What about the airphone idea?
3870741 3872076 There's 18 planes up there.
3872159 3873619 Only five of them have those phones.
3873619 3874912 We got through to three of them.
3874996 3876372 We're still trying on the others.
3876455 3877957 That leaves 13 accidents<br />waiting to happen.
3877999 3880084 -Are they still bucking headwinds?<br />-I just checked the weather.
3880126 3881544 Headwinds are slamming everybody
3881586 3882587 over the outer marker.
3882670 3883796 The planes with enough fuel
3883880 3886424 have already been shunted<br />to Atlanta, Memphis, and Nashville.
3887383 3888843 Outer marker.
3888885 3889886 Damn!
3890803 3892305 The outer marker!
3892972 3894265 It's a beacon, right?
3894390 3896392 A radio beacon that sends out<br />this "beep beep beep"
3896475 3897768 so they know they're over it, right?
3897852 3898811 -So?<br />-So who says
3898895 3900605 that radio signal has to just beep?
3900646 3902231 Right. We switch the frequency
3902273 3904108 from the tower over<br />to the one in the beacon.
3904150 3905860 We pump up the wattage.
3905860 3906903 And we can talk to our planes,
3906944 3908195 and those bastards who did this
3908237 3909405 will never know!
3912742 3913951 Traced the signal.
3913993 3915620 Found it in the luggage area.
3915661 3916621 They've been tapped in
3916662 3918122 to your tower chatter all night.
3918623 3920458 Punks stealing luggage, huh, Carmine?
3924128 3925379 How you doing, Telford?
3925421 3927757 No good. I called Langley.
3927798 3928966 They're rigging a portable decoder.
3929008 3930176 It'll be here in two hours.
3930217 3932053 My wife doesn't have two hours.
3932094 3934430 I was only transferred<br />to Grant's team yesterday.
3934472 3936182 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3937016 3939435 But word is, nobody's better<br />at this than Major Grant.
3939477 3940895 Attention!
3940895 3942855 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3944607 3947109 I want to hear about the plane<br />those bastards asked for.
3947735 3949153 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.
3949195 3952198 -Pilots' briefing room. Now.<br />-Keep working.

3959455 3960748 No civilians.
3971926 3973427 What the fuck?
3973469 3975012 What is it?
3975680 3977515 The outer marker beeper.

4066479 4067563 Which one of these maps gets me in there?
4067646 4068898 Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
4068939 4070399 -Find the map, Marvin.<br />-I'll find it.
4070483 4072485 You'll mess up my whole<br />damn filing system here.
4072526 4073903 Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.
4073944 4075946 I think that's in the main terminal,
4075988 4079658 so would that be under P<br />for pilots' briefing room?
4079700 4081118 -Now, Marvin!<br />-Or maybe it would be
4081160 4083704 under M for miscellaneous.

4104642 4105684 Gentlemen...
4106936 4108395 tonight, the pattern ends.
4109063 4111482 The dominoes will fall no more,
4111524 4113234 and the ramparts will remain upright.
4113275 4114902 Sir, General Esperanza's plane
4114944 4116445 just came on the scope.
4123953 4125663 Attention, Dulles Tower.
4125746 4127540 We will be lighting up a runway.
4127581 4131168 Do not, repeat, do not<br />attempt to land any planes.
4131210 4133504 Remember, we're monitoring you.
4137007 4138092 What do we do?
4139593 4140719 Obey.
4146851 4149603 <i>Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael 1.</i>
4149895 4152231 Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael 1.
4152398 4154400 This is Foxtrot Michael 1, Dulles.
4154441 4155734 We read you. Over.
4155776 4157695 Foxtrot Michael 1, you are to come in
4157778 4161448 on Runway 1-5, repeat, 1-5.
4175796 4178132 I found it on the floor, by the coat,
4178132 4179550 next to the luggage belt.
4179592 4182094 What the hell you so<br />excited about that for?
4182219 4184054 The code's still punched into this one.
4184138 4185431 You like it, huh?
4185514 4187975 How about giving me 20 bucks for it?
4188642 4190102 How about I let you live?
4191520 4193314 Man knows how to bargain.
4193898 4195941 This is contrary to our instructions.
4195983 4198736 We are to land at Runway 1-0,
4198777 4200070 where we are to be met
4200112 4202656 by representatives of your justice de--
4202698 4207411 Captain, please tell the tower<br />you will proceed as ordered.
4218589 4220507 Roger, Dulles.
4221217 4223177 Proceeding to runway 1-5.

4242696 4244031 What are you going to do now?
4244073 4245532 Are you going to shoot me?
4245574 4247117 So who will fly the plane?
4247159 4248661 Don't worry about it.
4248702 4250329 It's not your problem.
4251830 4255125 (plane descending)

4283737 4287157 I've lost cabin pressure.<br />Near zero visibility.
4287825 4289827 I must drop out<br />of this weather and land now,

4296250 4298252 <i>I must drop out of the storm.</i>

4302840 4305634 <i>Repeat. I cannot circle around</i>
4305676 4306969 <i>to runway 1-5.</i>
4310681 4312391 I'll make you a deal, Marvin.
4312433 4314518 You show me a shortcut<br />out to those runways,
4314560 4316103 and I'll get you a liner for that coat.
4316145 4317229 Repeat.
4317271 4319565 I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.
4319606 4320858 Shit.

4559680 4560973 Who are you?
4561056 4561890 A cop.

4562975 4564059 Yeah, one of the good guys.
4564142 4565519 You're one of the bad guys,
4565561 4567229 and now that I got your sorry ass,

4589960 4591712 -Where did he go?<br />-In there.
4602264 4603849 ESPERANZA: I don't believe this.
4603890 4605434 Two months of planning,
4605517 4607269 and you can't anticipate<br />one <i>pendejo </i>of a cop.

4613942 4615777 -General!<br />-Ah! I'm all right.
4616236 4619823 He said he was a policeman.<br />I thought you had this place secured.

4652105 4654900 Aah!

4661823 4662908 Three each!

4772726 4774269 See if you can get any TV.

4861064 4862148 but he's hurt.
4863567 4864943 He took a round in his shoulder.
4865235 4868071 Plus I got one more of their guys.<br />That's six they lost altogether.
4868154 4870323 Maybe if we knew how many<br />they had to start with,
4870407 4871408 we could get excited,
4871491 4874828 but if they got 50 guys, it's a little<br />early to break out the champagne!
4875453 4877038 Now, we appreciate your effort, McClane,
4877122 4878874 but we don't need<br />a loose cannon on this deck!
4878957 4880709 What if they decide to crash another plane
4880709 4882502 in retaliation for your little stunt?
4882627 4884337 They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?
4884504 4886423 Besides, if I grabbed Esperanza,
4886506 4887799 this would all be over by now.
4887883 4890552 Maybe they're just more<br />creative than you think!
4890552 4892304 Well, at least I'm thinking, God damn it!
4892470 4893722 Listen, you wise-ass,
4893805 4895390 we're here to jerk off that cocksucker
4895432 4896725 until he tries to take off.
4896808 4897726 Period!

4909070 4910405 Pentagon.
4910447 4911781 I'll take it in here.
4911823 4912908 Thank you, Telford.
4912949 4914492 You men come with me.
4917579 4919331 -McClane.<br />-Yeah, Barnes.
4919372 4921291 You said those guys<br />showed up out there right away?
4921374 4922208 Yeah.
4922292 4924794 That means they're on the field or close,
4925253 4927047 and I think I know where.
4927505 4929132 Come here. Let me show you something.
4931301 4932552 These are the old plans
4932594 4934304 when the longer runways went in.
4934387 4935972 That's 12 years ago.
4936598 4938725 Looks like they've done<br />some modifications on site--
4938767 4940727 moved Tra Con phones, ILS,
4940769 4942145 all the underground stuff
4942145 4944439 so they could handle drainage.
4944481 4945315 If I'm right,
4945315 4947901 all of it would run right<br />along the airport property
4947984 4949819 and go right past this neighborhood.
4953907 4956159 We should have been<br />on the ground two hours ago!
4956159 4959579 I understand, but if you just relax...
4959621 4961331 It's hopeless.
4961373 4963541 Somebody ought to get their<br />ass kicked for this mess,
4963583 4965418 that's for sure.
4965460 4967087 Well, unfortunately, there really isn't
4967128 4969339 anyone we can blame for the weather.
4969381 4972300 Oh, yeah? What about<br />that porker Willard Scott?
4972342 4974010 I should have taken the bus.
4974052 4977263 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4977722 4978974 Excuse me.
4979015 4979975 Yes?
4980684 4982268 I was just wondering.
4982310 4984020 This flight originally
4984062 4986523 was supposed to be 5 1/2 hours, right?
4986564 4987482 Mm-hmm.
4987565 4990610 Do we have enough fuel<br />to keep circling like this?
4990652 4991987 Oh, of course.
4992028 4994197 They anticipate little problems like this.
5011464 5013591 Barnes, we looked at 12 fucking houses,
5013675 5014926 and we're nowhere.
5014968 5016511 This is our last possibility.
5017595 5019723 Over here there's an old church.
5019764 5020682 Let's go.
5025562 5026855 Wait.
5033611 5037115 There's the church over there.
5044039 5045832 Could be a sentry.
5045874 5047417 And he could just be out for a walk.
5047459 5051212 Then why is he going<br />over his own footsteps?
5053214 5054841 Come on.
5056301 5058011 All right.
5058053 5060346 Just stay here and get ready<br />to call the Marines.
5060388 5062057 I thought they were the army.
5062098 5064100 Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
5081034 5082118 (beeping)
5082160 5083536 Oh, shit.
5083578 5086289 Not now.
5087499 5089751 Aah!
5099469 5101429 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5101471 5103056 <i>Barnes, where the hell did you go?</i>
5103098 5104557 <i>-Where's McClane?</i><br />-He's with me.
5104641 5105850 We're at the Hidey Lake Community Church
5105934 5107227 on the west side of the airport.
5107352 5109062 You're where? God damn it!
5109104 5110438 You crazy idiot, why didn't--
5110480 5111981 <i>This must be their base of operations.</i>
5112065 5113066 <i>Shut up and get your ass over here!</i>
5113149 5115360 <i>-Move it!</i><br />-Code red! Sit rep.
5116027 5118571 We got positive I.D. on Stuart's location.
5118613 5119697 Let's move.
5119739 5120657 Yo!
5131084 5132752 Our escape plane will be ready
5132794 5134295 within 30 minutes, General.
5136381 5138633 If there are no more surprises.
5153189 5156401 Gentlemen, we have a situation here.

5215960 5217503 Oh!

5248368 5249577 Jeez, McClane, you all right?
5249661 5250536 You want a medic?
5250620 5252413 McClane, what the hell you think<br />you're doing out there,
5252497 5253748 playing John Wayne?
5253790 5256251 How would you like to spend<br />the rest of the night in a cell?
5256292 5258253 Lorenzo, shut the fuck up<br />and do something useful.
5258336 5259712 Go seal off the street.
5259796 5261506 Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
5261547 5262924 Oh, no, Carmine?
5263216 5266678 Sergeant, get this bureaucrat<br />out of Mr. McClane's face now.
5266719 5268596 With pleasure, sir.

5272475 5274060 the men are in position, sir.

5276521 5277689 Fire only on my order.
5277772 5278898 Roger that, sir.
5278982 5280775 Guess I was wrong about you.
5280817 5283736 You're not such an asshole after all.
5283778 5284988 No, you were right.
5285029 5286906 I'm just your kind of asshole.

5409153 5411656 Aah!
5415660 5417537 Aah!
5427630 5429674 This equipment, it could land our planes.
5429757 5430925 Don't touch anything.
5431008 5432009 There were trip wires outside.
5432093 5433219 They could have booby-trapped--
5433302 5434512 -They did.<br />-Got one here, too.
5434595 5437098 Looks like C-4. The motherfucker is armed.
5437348 5439100 Clear the area! Everybody, now!
5443354 5445106 They booby-trapped all the equipment.
