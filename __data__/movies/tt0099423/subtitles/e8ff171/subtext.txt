41718 42632 It's alright.
43336 44775 Yeah.<br />Set it down nice and easy?
44934 46358 Yeah, sure. At the impound.
46359 47837 Next time read the sign.
47839 49102 Hey! You don't understand. Look.
49103 50593 I'm just here to meet my wife's plane.
50594 52068 You got to let me have this car.
52070 55012 Yeah, sure. Tomorrow, 8:00 to 4:00.<br />You pay 40 bucks, we give it back.
55014 56781 Don't write it up!<br />Don't write it up!
56940 57708 Come on, man.
57747 59277 This is my mother-in-law's car, alright?
59279 61003 She's already mad at me<br />because I'm not a dentist.
61553 64306 Look, I'm a cop L.A.P.D.<br />How about a little team spirit?
64356 65578 Oh, I was in L.A. once.
65915 66725 Hated it.
66727 68651 Well, I can understand.<br />I don't like it much myself.
68653 70718 Hey! That's a plastic fender up there!
70719 71749 Take it easy!<br />Back off!
71780 73748 I'm doing my job!<br />Cut me some slack, will you?
73832 75571 Look, I used to be a cop in New York City.
75573 77618 I only moved to L.A. because<br />my wife took a job there.
78250 79405 Come on.<br />What do you say?

141775 143722 Hi. Where are the telephones?<br />Right over there.
143724 144463 Thank you.
144805 147346 <i>Thank you, Fred.<br />Leonard Adkins is in a warmer clime,</i>
147406 149444 <i>with a story that grows<br />hotter by the minute.</i>
149816 153444 <i>Security was tight today at Escalon Airport<br />in the Republic of Val Verde,</i>
153662 157832 <i>where government authorities report<br />that deposed general Ramon Esperanza,</i>
157834 160722 <i>will be delivered for immediate<br />extradition to the United States.</i>
161044 163300 <i>Only two years ago General Esperanza,</i>
163302 166652 <i>led his country's army in a campaign<br />against communist insurgents.</i>
166753 169861 <i>A campaign fought with<br />American money and advisers.</i>
170011 172527 <i>Esperanza's fall from power caused ripples</i>
172529 174458 <i>not only in his country's recent election</i>
174739 176426 <i>but closer to home as well,</i>
176708 179140 <i>when high-ranking Pentagon<br />officials were charged</i>
179142 182221 <i>with supplying him with weapons<br />despite the congressional ban.</i>
182500 184960 <i>But mounting evidence<br />that Esperanza's forces</i>
184974 187225 <i>violated the neutrality<br />of neighboring countries</i>
187529 189232 <i>made Congress withhold funds.</i>
189437 191971 <i>Funds which Esperanza<br />is accused of replacing</i>
191973 195005 <i>by going into the lucrative<br />business of cocaine smuggling.</i>
195093 196951 <i>Although Esperanza was removed</i>
196973 198911 <i>as commander in chief earlier this year.</i>
199204 202439 <i>The agreement to extradite him<br />was not reached until yesterday,</i>
202620 206266 <i>and Washington insiders say<br />it was a phone call that made it happen.</i>
206360 207985 <i>A phone call from a...</i>
212846 214398 Alright. Alright.
218117 220731 If I could find a phone,<br />I'd call you, whoever you are.
254471 255342 Excuse me.<br />Thank you.
264675 267066 <i>Yes, this is Lieutenant McClane.<br />Somebody there just beep me?</i>

281165 283166 progress peaked with frozen pizza.
283333 284386 Listen now,
284714 286909 we're gonna be about half<br />an hour late landing, ok?
286946 288915 I just wanted to let you know.
289189 290013 The kids ok?
290310 292093 Well, they're about to lose their minds,
292095 293949 from all the sugar your parents<br />are giving them.
294853 297069 Did Mom give you a hard time<br />about borrowing her new car?
297664 298452 <i>No.</i>

316962 318147 I love you. Bye.
323520 325674 Isn't technology wonderful?
327419 328868 My husband doesn't think so.
329350 330379 Well, I do.
331180 333942 I used to carry around<br />those awful Mace things.
334551 335400 Now...
337971 341265 I zap any bastard that screws with me.
343894 345441 I tried it on my little dog.
347147 349406 Poor thing limped for a week.
357161 358122 Excuse me.
360225 361887 Boy, you look really familiar to me.

436127 437164 Help yourself.
449238 452064 It just don't seem right somehow<br />closing down this church.
452445 456183 Oh I know, the parish is gonna keep on<br />using it, but it won't be the same.
456753 459336 Been here a lot of years,<br />and I've been right here with it.
459986 460740 Yeah,
460903 464341 I kind of feel like a piece of me<br />is dying along with this church.

972127 973207 Where's your I.D.?
978148 979770 On its way to Cleveland?
986236 988080 No, you did not explain anything.
988545 990804 All you did was shove me back here<br />into this cattle car.
990904 993368 Sir, you were told when you boarded<br />that we were overbooked.
993427 994860 Fine. Done. I accept that.
994923 997898 But why in hell can't I get<br />the first-class meal my network paid for?
998317 999418 Do you know who I am?
999419 1001205 Yes. We've all seen your program.
1001408 1003142 Your episode Flying Junkyards
1003143 1005629 was a very objective look<br />at air traffic safety.
1005746 1009349 It wasn't nearly as edifying<br />as Bimbos of the Sky, was it Connie?
1009918 1011166 You think you're funny.
1011826 1012938 You think you're funny.
1013077 1013900 Fine.
1014785 1015996 I've got your number.
1016427 1017665 And I've got yours.
1017783 1019458 So park it, sir.
1021732 1022662 Fine.
1033043 1033967 Stewardess.
1034293 1035735 Mr. Thornberg,
1035736 1037707 you cannot monopolize my time.
1037820 1039373 You cannot put me near that woman.
1039908 1040905 Excuse me?
1042633 1045776 He means he's filed<br />a restraining order against me.
1046552 1048714 I'm not allowed within 50 feet of him.
1048973 1050240 Fifty yards.
1050868 1054266 So by keeping me in this section,<br />you are violating a court order.
1054645 1056693 I can sue you and this airline.
1058142 1059669 That woman assaulted me,
1060219 1061939 and she humiliated me in public.
1069780 1070976 What did you do?
1073331 1074925 Knocked out two of his teeth.
1076239 1077869 Would you like some champagne?
1082256 1083664 Sorry, Officer McClane.
1083807 1084808 I had to check.
1084917 1086477 Here's your piece and shield back.
1087913 1088884 Thanks.
1089555 1091403 Hey, over here, Officer!
1091761 1093100 We understand that<br />there was shooting.
1094320 1096881 The presence of Justice<br />Department officials.
1096992 1098601 Jesus! Oh, Christ!
1098602 1100036 Hey, come on. Just a word, ok?
1100257 1101736 What the fuck are you people.
1102119 1103422 What are you doing here, man?
1103424 1104460 This is a crime scene.
1104461 1106194 You got to seal this area off,<br />for Christ's sake.
1106213 1108408 That's up to the captain.<br />Oh, it's up to the captain?
1108410 1110403 Maybe you better take me<br />up to the captain then?
1121711 1123296 Where's Cochrane?<br />He didn't make it.
1123381 1124724 Oh, man.
1133518 1134586 You're late.
1136310 1137909 We ran into trouble, Colonel.
1138555 1139745 Some cop.
1140467 1141507 He killed Cochrane.
1142498 1143807 I barely got away, sir.
1143832 1145245 Did you accomplish your mission?
1146904 1147775 Yes sir but...
1148550 1149406 Cochrane, sir.
1149666 1150822 Well, then the damage is minimal.
1151314 1152920 The penalty could be severe.
1161877 1163050 You fail me again,
1163269 1164828 and the chamber won't be empty.
1166273 1167502 Dismissed.
1184564 1186265 Who is it? Come in.
1187820 1189142 Captain Lorenzo?<br />Yeah.
1190031 1191144 I'm John McClane.
1191145 1192782 Yeah, yeah. I know who you are.
1192867 1195365 You're the asshole<br />that just broke seven F.A.A.
1195536 1197843 and five District of Columbia regulations,
1197845 1199944 running around my airport with a gun,
1199945 1201029 shooting at people.
1201178 1202563 What do you call that shit?
1203128 1204309 Self-defense.
1204864 1207657 Well, what you think that L.A. badge<br />is gonna get you,
1207659 1209528 a free lunch or something around here?
1210248 1211025 No.
1211585 1213155 Maybe a little professional courtesy.
1213622 1215387 In an airport on Christmas week?
1215472 1216818 You got to be kidding.
1216819 1217993 Ok. Fuck courtesy.
1217995 1219528 How about just being professional?
1219968 1222598 Your boys just walked away<br />from a crime scene, Captain.
1222981 1225120 You can't wrap this thing up<br />in 10 minutes, and you know it.
1225122 1227441 You got to seal the area off,<br />take pictures, dust for prints.
1227443 1229361 Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.
1229445 1230898 I know what I'm doing.
1231304 1232756 We're gonna dust it down.
1232758 1234321 We'll take all the pictures.
1234322 1236298 We'll sweep for fibers.<br />When are you gonna do this?
1236300 1238495 After three or four hundred<br />more people go through there?
1238776 1240597 You'd be lucky to get a print<br />from one of your own people.
1240756 1242396 Just shut down that area and
1242398 1244027 Oh, just shut the area down?
1244029 1246337 It's that simple?<br />I just shut the area down?
1246420 1247148 Shit.
1247149 1250131 And I got everybody from<br />the Shriners convention,
1250133 1252662 to the goddamn Boy Scouts<br />traipsing through here!
1252731 1253941 I got lost kids,
1254074 1256081 lost dogs...<br />Not now! Later!
1256339 1258379 I got international diplomats.
1258443 1260835 I got a fucking reindeer flying in here
1260837 1262722 from the fucking petting zoo!
1262827 1263378 But,
1263538 1265963 John McClane, he's got a little problem.
1266047 1268400 Hell, let's shut down<br />the whole fucking airport!
1268484 1270986 What do you think they're gonna<br />say upstairs when I tell them that?
1271070 1272846 Why don't you pick up<br />the phone and find out?
1272923 1275633 Because I don't need<br />full fucking forensics to tell me
1275635 1278303 all this was, was some punk<br />stealing luggage!
1278305 1279146 Luggage?
1279148 1281563 That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.<br />You know what that is?
1281622 1283578 It's a porcelain gun made in Germany.
1283579 1285500 It doesn't show up on<br />your airport x-ray machines,
1285502 1287364 and it costs more than<br />you make in a month.
1287544 1289519 You'd be surprised what I make in a month.
1290379 1291661 If it's more than $1.98,
1291663 1292805 I'd be very surprised.<br />Hey, McClane
1292807 1294645 don't start believing your own press.
1295330 1298595 Yeah, yeah, I know all about<br />you and that Nakatomi thing in L.A.
1299113 1302183 But just because the TV thinks<br />you're hot shit, that don't make it so.
1302798 1305504 Look, you are in my little pond now,
1305863 1308332 and I am the big fish that runs it.
1309447 1312003 So you capped some lowlife.<br />Fine.
1312304 1315064 I'll send your fucking captain in L.A.
1315065 1316413 a fucking commendation!
1316632 1318761 Now in the meantime, you get<br />the hell out of my office
1318763 1321508 before I have you thrown out<br />of my goddamn airport!
1332608 1334245 Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.
1334941 1336858 What sets off the metal detectors first?
1337519 1339804 The lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1340325 1341431 Fat fuck.
1350840 1352984 Any I.D. on this guy?
1352986 1355113 That's somebody else's problem.<br />Wait here.
1357406 1358991 Ok, your car's ready.
1358992 1360433 If you'd just sign right here<br />Hi.
1360493 1362786 Hi.<br />I need to borrow this and this.
1362788 1364662 I'll bring it right back.<br />Hey!
1366215 1367382 Hey! Yo! Hold up!
1368733 1369416 Yo!
1372337 1373247 Hold up, boys.
1373593 1374463 Hold up. Hold up.
1374465 1375568 We got to check something.<br />What are you doing?
1376162 1377625 Pretty gruesome fucking job.
1378229 1379594 In all the confusion in there,
1380262 1381958 we forgot to get this clown's prints.
1382056 1383129 Believe that?
1386832 1387639 Christ.
1387641 1389385 Hey, you're supposed<br />to do that at the morgue.
1389412 1390313 Not anymore.
1390314 1392998 Got a new S.O.P.<br />for D.O.A.'s from the F.A.A.
1397345 1398912 I don't think this one's<br />gonna make it, boys.
1399036 1400035 Thanks a lot.
1514130 1514963 Powell here.
1514988 1517760 Take that Twinkie out of your<br />mouth and grab a pencil, will ya?
1519075 1520343 Hey, John.<br />How you doing?
1520528 1521903 Holly stood me up a day,
1521905 1524134 and I'm here alone in D.C.
1524135 1525028 <i>with my in-laws.</i>
1526040 1527314 The old in-laws?
1527765 1530468 Man, they do love their policemen<br />son-in-laws, don't they?
1530551 1532082 Listen, Al, what is the...
1532273 1534852 <i>fax machine telephone number<br />there at the station?</i>
1537158 1537932 Let's see.
1539415 1541020 555-3212.
1541338 1544054 3212.<br />Hold on a second, alright?
1544208 1545924 I wanna send you something here.
1546152 1546974 Excuse me.
1547140 1548456 <i>You and faxes?</i>
1549142 1550144 <i>This is a first.</i>
1550511 1553490 Yeah, well, Holly told me I should<br />wake up and smell the '90s.
1553644 1554566 This way?
1554567 1556048 No. That way.
1556620 1557593 Wait. It's upside down.
1557594 1558872 It doesn't matter.
1558996 1560272 Ok. Here it comes.
1563320 1564912 I'm sending you something right now.
1565746 1566856 Hold on a second, cowboy.
1582558 1583338 Fingerprints?
1583689 1585268 <i>Got an unidentified stiff here.</i>
1585420 1587085 I've circled the whorls in pen
1587401 1588910 in case the transmission is a little fuzzy.
1588912 1590263 Listen, run it through state and federal,
1590265 1591598 and if you can run it through Interpol.
1591871 1592639 Will do.
1592640 1594017 Well, what's this about?
1594501 1595696 Just a feeling I have.
1597280 1599859 When you get those feelings,<br />insurance companies start to go bankrupt.
1600341 1602804 Listen, the fax number is...
1602957 1604155 ls on the top edge
1604156 1605656 of the transmission he just got.<br />Is on the top edge
1605658 1607293 of the transmission you just got.
1610711 1611780 Oh, an airport?
1612569 1614979 Listen, you're not pissing<br />in somebody's pool, are you?
1616336 1618458 Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.
1625049 1627038 Just as this storm starts breaking,
1627314 1630002 the satellite feed up<br />and drops the other shoe on us.
1630816 1632395 Look at this new front moving in.
1632640 1634557 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chickenshit.
1636861 1639083 Well, I can sand down<br />all the runways and...
1639137 1640772 keep the plows going between landings,
1640798 1643032 but you got to downshift them up there,<br />give me time to work.
1643651 1644571 You got it.
1646043 1647115 Alright, everyone.
1647978 1650156 Let's call all our birds<br />and slow them down
1650158 1651958 before we get a parking lot<br />over our heads.
1652420 1655517 The line starts at the Mississippi<br />and they better start taking numbers.
1666730 1667856 Can I get you another?
1671780 1672831 No, thank you.
1672992 1675442 I only have to look at his face<br />for another 15 or 20 minutes.
1677685 1679644 <i>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />this is the captain speaking.</i>
1679913 1682543 I've just been informed<br />by Dulles Traffic Control,
1682629 1684690 that there is a weather front<br />moving in ahead of us.
1685537 1687912 We may be up here<br />a little while longer.
1688528 1689423 Thank you.
1690382 1691214 On second thought.
1699138 1699867 Al?
1700032 1701374 Hey, I'm right here, partner.
1701906 1704858 Your stiff's dossier<br />is coming through right now.
1706030 1708419 <i>What can you tell me about him?</i>
1708465 1709527 He's dead.
1709730 1711529 You needed a computer<br />to figure that one out?
1711893 1713542 No, no, no, no.<br />You don't follow me.
1714186 1717676 According to the Department of Defense,<br />he's been dead for two years.
1718079 1718799 What?
1719086 1722062 <i>That's right. Sergeant<br />Oswald Cochrane.</i>
1722187 1724281 American adviser in Honduras.
1724940 1727533 Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.
1727776 1728724 Officer?
1730321 1733960 <i>Read between the lines, and I'd say<br />it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff to me.</i>
1734189 1736774 Yeah, I see it.<br />Alright, Al. Thanks a lot.
1736952 1738084 Hey, anytime.
1738772 1739501 Ok.
1741290 1743127 Say, I close in about an hour.
1743292 1745209 Maybe we can go get a drink?
1747969 1749029 Just the fax, ma'am.
1749529 1750636 Just the fax.
1755992 1757420 Hey, wait a second.<br />I see somebody.
1757421 1758991 I'll call you back, ok?<br />Hold on. Hold on.
1765362 1766773 The Ghost of Christmas Past.
1766857 1768305 Nakatomi? L.A.?
1768306 1769597 You're John McClane, right?
1769737 1770654 Who are you?
1770655 1772410 Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
1773473 1774785 Excuse me.<br />Hey, come on.
1774787 1776871 Give me a break.<br />I saw the stiff.
1776950 1778782 Word is, that was your handiwork.
1779092 1779730 No.
1780168 1781573 I only do needle-point.
1787075 1787895 Great.
1788286 1789763 National just shut down.
1790040 1791004 Totally iced.
1791159 1792725 They're gonna be sending us<br />their planes.
1792726 1794152 Happy, happy holidays.
1794182 1796332 The worst part, Mr. Trudeau,<br />was the press.
1796666 1799509 They were here anyways, crawling<br />all over the Esperanza story,
1799533 1801153 so they got it right on the fucking news.
1801176 1802586 You know, bloodstains and all.
1802820 1806155 Personally, I'd like to lock every<br />damn reporter out of the airport,
1806401 1809048 but then they'd just pull<br />that freedom-of-speech crap on us.
1809050 1811182 Then the A.C.L.U. would be all over us.
1811354 1812908 Murder on television.
1813116 1814974 Hell of a start for Christmas week.
1816656 1818796 What is it?<br />A gang thing like last time?
1818895 1821429 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1823330 1825081 Who the hell is this?<br />John McClane.
1825083 1827429 I'm a police officer.<br />In an unauthorized area.
1827593 1829803 L.A., Mr. Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1830170 1833023 Yeah? That's what I said about<br />my last cholesterol test.
1834070 1836389 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1838095 1840346 I'm sure Captain Lorenzo<br />has explained to you,
1840348 1842725 the minor little fracas<br />with the minor little thieves.
1843063 1844559 Maybe he can explain this.
1863954 1865242 <i>All systems tapped, Colonel.</i>
1865787 1866772 Fire it up.
1881766 1883508 H minus five minutes.
1884049 1884952 Stand by.
1886643 1887489 Alright.
1887623 1890530 We've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1890694 1892521 Assuming it's not a computer error,
1892522 1893481 what do we assume?
1893483 1895692 That somebody's about<br />to seriously fuck with this airport.
1895715 1897364 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
1897906 1899597 I mean, I know<br />we're dummies up here, McClane
1899599 1901767 so give us a taste of your brilliant genius.
1901909 1904204 I mean, you're talking about a hijacking,<br />a robbery or what?
1904230 1905019 Look, I'm not sure
1905078 1906517 Oh, he's not sure.
1906518 1907870 Well, I'm stunned.
1907871 1909241 I got to lie down.
1909243 1911462 The only people that go to this<br />much trouble are professionals.
1911587 1913333 Not luggage thieves and not punks.
1913334 1914286 Professional at what?
1914350 1916309 What the fuck do you think this is?
1916310 1917690 The safety patrol here?
1917777 1920295 This is the résumé<br />of a professional mercenary.
1920297 1922126 You got the world's biggest<br />drug dealer on his way here,
1922127 1923898 now what you need, a slide<br />rule to figure this out?
1923929 1926807 Or maybe another body in a zipper bag<br />before you start asking questions?
1926819 1929797 Hey pal, you're the one that gave us<br />that fucking body, remember that.
1930525 1931854 Yeah, I remember that.
1938954 1939880 Lorenzo,
1940221 1942027 have all your shift<br />commanders report in.
1942029 1942650 Now.
1942651 1944201 What? You're not buying into this?
1944203 1946468 I want them to report<br />anything out of the ordinary,
1946470 1948024 no matter how trivial.<br />You got that?
1948131 1949188 Yeah, I got it.
1949446 1950597 Oh, my God!
1951032 1951786 What?
1951886 1953473 The runways. Look.<br />Son of a bitch!
1953669 1955904 What the hell?<br />They're shutting down.
1956445 1957781 Jesus Christ.
1963804 1965654 Go to emergency lighting, now.
1966890 1969141 Emergency.<br />We are in a code yellow.
1969608 1971167 Backup systems won't come up.
1971211 1972269 Shunt to another terminal.
1972275 1974605 Bobby, what do you got?<br /><i>Nothing. The whole network is down.</i>
1974675 1975955 The whole network is down.
1976024 1977620 Maybe we should call the power company?
1977901 1979735 We're on the same goddamn grid,<br />and we're hot.
1979820 1981438 <i>Dulles, what's going on?<br />I'm on approach.</i>
1981440 1983323 Maintain position. Repeat.
1983324 1984805 <i>What's going on down there?</i>
1985008 1986357 Roger. We're on it. We're on it.
1986359 1988042 Western, we're unable right now.<br />Please delay.

1998046 2000041 I've checked all systems.<br />It ain't happening!
2014104 2015556 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2016730 2017683 What's it look like?
2017858 2019175 Approach control it's gone.
2019651 2020334 Jesus.
2020336 2022010 Instrument landing system is down.

2065761 2068156 There must be 15,000 people<br />in this airport,
2068158 2069821 and we don't need panic on our hands.
2070827 2072797 We just bought ourselves<br />maybe two hours.
2073803 2076396 After that, those planes low on fuel<br />aren't gonna be circling.
2076917 2078983 They're gonna be dropping<br />on the White House lawn.
2081794 2082831 McClane,
2083144 2084547 this what you expected?
2086460 2087192 No.
2088831 2090208 This is just the beginning.
2094476 2096131 F.A.A. hotline.
2096377 2097603 How could they know already?
2097827 2098963 They can't.
2100857 2103096 Maybe it's the boys<br />that pulled all your plugs.
2103767 2104902 Put it on speaker.

2115091 2116882 I think I've got your attention.

2125286 2126173 Who is this?
2127149 2128946 Who I am is unimportant.
2129158 2130430 What I want...
2131608 2132964 Well, if you don't want those planes
2132965 2135481 to start splashing into the Potomac<br />as they run out of fuel,
2135483 2137248 what I want is very important.
2137967 2140780 <i>A plane will be landing<br />at this airport in 58 minutes.</i>

2148677 2150450 <i>And the importance of its cargo.</i>
2151487 2154007 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2155411 2157725 It will land on a runway of my designation,
2157741 2160576 where it will remain isolated<br />and unapproached.
2161139 2164825 That will conclude my interest<br />in this aircraft and your responsibility for it.
2165794 2166839 At the same time,
2167314 2169885 I want a 747 cargo conversion,
2170264 2171338 fully fueled,
2171595 2173572 <i>and placed at my disposal.</i>
2173972 2175889 <i>You have two more minutes to advise</i>
2175891 2178454 <i>your inbound aircraft<br />to hold at their outer radio marker.</i>
2178727 2181185 <i>After that, you will be able<br />to receive only.</i>
2182208 2184822 <i>Any attempt to restore<br />your systems will be met</i>
2184824 2186438 by severe penalties.
2186651 2187867 He's bluffing.
2188889 2190404 Damn it, you can't do this.
2191034 2192573 I am doing this.
2200931 2203167 Ok, you guys, listen up.<br />I need you to punch up a code 15.
2203169 2204826 I got an idea, and I need your help.
2205801 2208102 If Esperanza gets on that plane<br />and makes it to a country,
2208104 2209797 that has no extradition treaties,<br />we're fucked.
2210008 2211858 They're talking to us on<br />our own goddamn system.
2211860 2212927 They got to be close.
2213011 2215012 I'll have my men tear this airport apart.
2215306 2216714 Just in the nick of time?
2216813 2218867 Hey McClane,<br />I got a first-class unit here,
2218869 2219933 SWAT team and all.
2219935 2222016 We don't need any<br />Monday-morning quarterbacks.
2222018 2222741 Fuck Monday morning.
2222743 2224238 My wife's on one of the goddamn planes
2224239 2225277 these guys are fucking with.
2225425 2226818 That puts me on the playing field.
2227006 2228217 And if you'd have moved your fat ass,
2228218 2230653 when I told you to we would<br />not be hip deep in shit right now.
2230655 2232663 That's it. Security. You're out of here.<br />Mr. Trudeau!
2232676 2235803 Mr. Trudeau, do I have to remind you<br />about F.A.A. regulations,
2235805 2238575 regarding unauthorized personnel<br />in the control tower?
2238577 2240806 All we have to do is find<br />a way to transmit.
2240829 2241643 Yeah, right.
2241644 2243643 Somebody wanna run down<br />to Radio Shack and get a transmitter?
2243645 2244764 We already have one.
2244765 2247614 The new terminal wing they're<br />building 20 airlines when it's done,
2247615 2249531 all with their own<br />reservation computers,
2249553 2251578 all tied in to a nice big antenna array.
2251580 2252856 Alright, better see Mr. McClane out.
2252858 2254190 Take him out of here<br />Get your fucking hands off me!
2254200 2255616 You got no business being up here.
2255618 2256386 I'm telling you guys.
2256388 2258240 Everything we need is over<br />by the annex sky-walk,
2258241 2259076 just sitting there,
2259118 2260979 waiting to go on line.<br />The annex sky-walk?
2260981 2263485 Goddamn it, Trudeau.<br />You're dealing with pros here.
2263979 2266067 You can't fuck with these people!<br />Listen to me!
2266069 2267544 Sam Coleman, WNTW news.
2267834 2269983 Mr. Trudeau, there are a lot of<br />rumors flying around here today.
2269985 2271466 No way. No way, lady.
2271467 2272646 Hell, no. No. You...
2272648 2274696 This is off limits, Coleman.<br />You know that.
2274698 2276376 Get them out of here.<br />Out of here.
2276378 2278595 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of too!
2278743 2280485 What's the hell!<br />Get your fucking hands off me.
2280502 2282754 For shit's sake,<br />just get them both out of here!
2284374 2286077 Lobby Security, come in.
2286921 2288797 Tomlinson here.<br /><i>This is Captain Lorenzo here,</i>
2288888 2291391 with two unauthorized personnel<br />in the fucking tower.
2291454 2293215 Now, would you get your<br />thumb out of your ass,
2293222 2294358 <i>get them out of the elevator</i>
2294359 2297100 <i>or you're gonna find a goddamn<br />pink slip in your Christmas stocking.</i>

2300136 2301462 Goddamn!
2302496 2304748 Anything who can think of?<br />Can't fuck with what guy?
2304750 2306401 Shit. Hang on over there.
2306403 2307777 What for?<br />Just hang on.
2309941 2311699 Big drug dealer on his way to prison,
2311894 2313198 gunfight at airport,
2313319 2315987 every controller in the coffee shop<br />getting beeped and hauling ass
2315989 2317152 and you rocking the boat.
2317434 2319927 Connection? Come on, McClane.<br />Just a few words.
2319933 2321850 Ok, just a few words.<br />Fuck off.
2322457 2324863 Thanks, but I already<br />got that from Colonel Stuart.
2326916 2327758 Stuart?
2328491 2330724 The guy that got canned by Congress.<br />That's who he was.
2331149 2333001 Who he who?<br />What? Hey just...
2333923 2335592 It's ok.<br />I've done this before.
2346895 2348222 Hey.<br />Hi.
2349141 2351348 Where's the other one?<br />Claustrophobic, I guess.
2354051 2357112 It's a VHF system, but the planes<br />are so close it doesn't matter.
2357197 2359278 I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,
2359279 2361011 wire in a crossover, and we're hot.
2361253 2363016 Even the planes would not<br />know the difference.
2363063 2365298 Get what you need.<br />Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2365462 2367609 I want my SWAT team<br />to go with him as cover.
2367712 2370339 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of too.
2376341 2378478 Oh, man.<br />I can't fucking believe this.
2379017 2380792 Another basement.<br />Another elevator.
2381892 2384380 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?
2443175 2444114 Who are you?
2446035 2447346 I'm Marvin.
2447591 2449746 Marvin. Marv... I'm...<br />I'm Marvin.
2449831 2452499 I thought you was trying<br />to steal my records, that's all.
2453214 2454654 I'm just the janitor.
2462267 2466025 This is Dulles Approach<br />to all aircraft holding at Potomac VORTAC.
2466080 2468915 <i>We are experiencing<br />some technical problems here.</i>
2468957 2471659 <i>The weather conditions,<br />which have been deteriorating all day,</i>

2505237 2506254 God bless.
2512644 2514041 Alright. Change the boards.
2542048 2543395 Ok, stand back.
2544050 2546988 The sky-walk annex.<br />No, goddamn it. The annex sky-walk.
2546990 2548466 Listen to me. The annex sky-walk.
2548468 2550122 It's the last thing I heard before<br />they kicked me out there.
2550595 2552224 Well, let me see here now.
2552743 2554921 Well, this must be it right there.<br />See?
2555871 2559058 That's the raised platform,<br />and there is the new terminal.
2559232 2560514 There's your sky-walk.
2561271 2562510 Goddamn bottleneck.
2563096 2564318 Nice place for an ambush.
2566715 2568782 What's the fastest way you can<br />get me out to that spot?
2572123 2574422 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2574789 2576782 Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.<br />We'll watch your back.
2577130 2579047 Yeah? Who watches yours?
2590642 2592221 Main ventilation duct.
2592812 2594449 Main ventilation duct.
2595476 2596928 And bingo.
2597195 2598276 Just once.
2598520 2601582 I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.
2603617 2604825 Eggnog,
2606048 2607342 a fucking Christmas tree
2608586 2609924 a little turkey.
2611559 2612511 But no,
2612980 2615903 I got to crawl around in<br />this motherfucking tin can.
2621057 2623496 We're in the annex sky-walk.<br />I can see the array.
2623755 2626679 I'll give you a call for a protocol test<br />as soon as it's hot.
2626950 2628082 That's all for now.
2628481 2630525 Sergeant, we may need<br />some more equipment.
2630612 2632580 I'd like to send one<br />of your guys back for it.
2632581 2634048 Right, sir. You got it.
2636635 2637990 What the hell?
2637991 2639386 What the hell's going on?
2639604 2640229 Hey!
2640230 2641557 Put that back on!
2644116 2646402 Hey asshole,<br />what do I look like to you?
2647052 2648543 A sitting duck.
2650602 2651400 Take him!
2653359 2654341 Shit!
2656746 2657523 Damn it.
2657524 2658814 I hate it when I'm right.
2663544 2665205 Look out!<br />Get down!
2673554 2675351 Keep your head down!
2686123 2687322 You son of a bitch!
2765908 2766913 Stay down!
2781503 2782142 Fuck!
2783582 2784613 Motherfucker!
2792124 2792881 Come on.
2814495 2815796 Fucking son of a bitch!
2832755 2833637 Shit.
2839220 2839994 Fuck.
2844517 2846696 I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.
2880920 2881660 Geez.
2882527 2883405 You alright?
2883890 2885215 Yeah. Yeah.
2885217 2887781 But the antenna array,<br />I got to get to it and set it up.
2892732 2893802 Get down!
2913144 2914599 Goddamn.
2917381 2918223 Bait.
2920949 2922143 Jerk us off
2923893 2925966 make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.
2930264 2931854 Make you waste your time,
2935334 2937251 time we don't have.
2951670 2953825 I think you're closer than 50 yards.
2954209 2955820 So's that airplane.
2956406 2957384 Practically.
2957588 2958328 Yeah.
2958909 2960047 There's quite a few of them out there.
2960049 2961755 It looks like a regular traffic jam.
2962051 2963581 There's nothing regular about it.
2964846 2966223 See? You're intrigued.
2966876 2968431 That's my gift, Mrs. McClane.
2968433 2969743 I notice things,
2969744 2971490 things other people would not see.
2972285 2974211 That's how I make people curious.
2974757 2976398 Don't you mean nauseous?
2977244 2980338 Look. The people have a right to know<br />everything about everybody.
2981294 2982821 You got in the way of that.
2982905 2984068 Listen buster,
2984069 2985490 you endangered my children,
2985492 2988288 and you didn't do it for anything<br />as noble as the people.
2989338 2991093 The only time you even see the people
2991095 2993455 is when you look down to see<br />what it is you're stepping.
2998564 3000648 Me? Yeah, I'll live
3000764 3002683 but Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead,
3003081 3005287 and the antenna array is gone.
3005724 3007100 Didn't you see it?
3009233 3010784 I'm tired of looking for a new miracle.
3014057 3016006 Just hold a minute.<br />No, I'll be right back.
3016008 3018215 Just hold for a second.<br />Something's going on here.
3018441 3020260 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Just hold on for a minute.
3020985 3023354 I say again, Annex Team,<br />give us a sit rep.
3025491 3027325 Annex Team, come in.<br />Do you copy?
3029535 3031192 It's got some kind of scramble on it.
3031742 3033230 Can you do anything with it?
3034664 3035459 No.
3035772 3038235 This scramble mode must<br />activate on this code panel.
3038606 3041151 Even if we scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in.
3041784 3044139 These guys are pros.<br />So you break the code.
3044175 3045990 I wanna hear what these bastards<br />are saying to each other.
3045992 3047727 This is a 10-digit control panel,
3047728 3049110 six-digit readout.
3049367 3051523 Hell, that could be<br />a million combinations.
3052063 3053831 Next time you kill one of these guys,
3054151 3055881 get him to enter the code first.
3058754 3059375 Sir,
3059749 3061635 we just monitored a call<br />from their chief engineer.
3061904 3064051 Our people took out<br />their SWAT team completely.
3064137 3066141 You were right.<br />They went for the antenna array.
3066306 3067222 We're right on schedule.
3067224 3069620 Losing our own team<br />wasn't part of the plan.
3076497 3077879 Attention, Dulles Tower.
3078255 3080021 <i>Attention, Dulles Control Tower.</i>

3119710 3122525 How much drug money<br />is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
3122716 3124403 I think Cardinal Richelieu said it best.
3125077 3127702 Treason is merely a matter of dates.
3128359 3131302 <i>This country's got to learn<br />that it can't keep cutting the legs off</i>
3131304 3133014 of men like General Esperanza,
3133268 3136640 men who have the guts to stand up<br />against communist aggression.
3138321 3140452 And lesson one starts<br />with killing policemen?
3140563 3142556 <i>What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?</i>
3144973 3147258 No. I think we can find<br />something in between.

3259982 3260956 <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
3260958 3263099 as you've probably noticed<br />we've started our descent.
3263589 3265143 <i>We're sorry for the inconvenience</i>
3265145 3267115 <i>but we'll all be on the ground<br />in a few minutes.</i>
3267506 3268810 Thank you.<br />Please keep your seat belts on.
3270693 3272780 Oh, not to worry, we've made<br />arrangements for your next flight,
3272782 3274236 so you won't miss it, ok?<br />Thank you.
3275217 3277543 In your seat, please.<br />Come on. In your seat.
3279259 3280276 Oh, hey.
3280806 3282248 We're just like British Rail, love.
3282345 3284029 We may be late, but we get you there.
3284805 3285799 Don't worry.
3302808 3304151 Good luck, McClane!
3327207 3329525 <i>Dulles, this is Windsor 114,</i>
3329526 3331096 <i>inside the outer marker.</i>
3331545 3332967 Roger, 114.
3332968 3334203 This is Dulles Tower.
3334465 3336814 We have radar contact<br />and show you on I.L.S.
3336816 3338513 You're in the glide path,<br />and you're looking good.
3348624 3350024 There's somebody out there!
3355068 3356093 It's McClane.
3357040 3357928 Christ.
3362371 3363550 Approach flaps.
3364491 3365445 Approach flaps.
3366126 3367520 Approach speed, 140.

3373796 3375750 800, guys!<br />You're only at 800 feet!
3375752 3377283 <i>Fire and Rescue,<br />this is Cummings.</i>
3377285 3379172 <i>Roll everything out<br />to runway two-niner!</i>

3382990 3383888 <i>600 feet.</i>
3385457 3386486 Looking good, Windsor.
3386994 3387834 Now watch it.
3387867 3390078 30-knot crosswinds<br />and the runway is icy.
3391026 3392585 Attaboy. We've got you.
3394316 3395537 We've got you.
3408213 3408934 No!
3409062 3410102 Pull up!
3411208 3412135 Jesus!
3426661 3428416 <i>We're gonna die!</i><br />We've got you.
3453083 3454143 No.
3455711 3456913 God.
3462176 3463403 Motherfucker.
3467098 3468022 Motherfucker.
3485167 3487520 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3488471 3491099 If the 747 we requested<br />is ready on time
3491101 3493688 and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested
3494441 3495885 further lessons can be avoided.
3496710 3497300 Out.
3498969 3500013 God.
3522167 3523483 Come on, you guys!
3530448 3531873 Hurry! Hurry!
3531875 3533563 We need a truck over there!
3544187 3548035 We got no sign of survivors down here!<br />It's a goddamn nightmare!
3562659 3563682 Barnes!
3564882 3568614 We've got to warn those planes there is a lunatic<br />down here who likes to pretend he's the tower.
3568699 3570300 Get up to the cabin.<br />Get me on the air.
3570325 3571225 How?
3571227 3572513 You figure it out!
3573099 3574539 Here's the manifest.
3595183 3596890 McClane, I know how you must feel.
3602578 3604334 I wanted to help those people tonight.
3606570 3608363 I was pretty goddamn useless.
3612851 3614603 We called the government for help.
3614605 3615333 They're...
3616079 3617731 gonna send in a special army unit
3619170 3620811 a counter-terrorist team.
3628660 3629994 Your wife's plane?
3631543 3634016 Well, they're still broadcasting<br />even though we can't answer.
3637300 3639458 They're gonna run out<br />of fuel in 90 minutes.
3651956 3652874 Listen, Dick.
3653409 3654817 That is your name...
3655244 3655826 Dick.
3656979 3658871 If you're going to continue<br />to get this close,
3658873 3661647 do you think you might consider<br />switching aftershaves?
3662933 3664125 Anything else?
3665219 3667323 Stronger mouth wash might be nice.
3671123 3672143 Well Colonel,
3672144 3673872 they've done everything<br />we've anticipated...
3674682 3675595 so far.
3675597 3678386 <i>But still there has been<br />no official word from authorities.</i>
3678670 3682833 <i>Meanwhile, despite the fact that only one<br />runway has been closed due to the tragedy,</i>
3683131 3686000 <i>several dozen airliners are<br />visible from where I stand,</i>
3686102 3687551 <i>endlessly circling the field.</i>
3687878 3691033 <i>Other reports say that there was<br />trouble in the tower before the crash</i>
3691034 3693322 <i>and that that may have<br />even contributed to it.</i>
3693496 3694826 <i>One thing is certain,</i>
3694827 3696233 <i>with weather<br />conditions worsening</i>
3696280 3699260 <i>the problem here and in the sky above us<br />will continue to grow.</i>
3699455 3700870 <i>I'm Samantha Coleman</i>
3700871 3702608 <i>at Dulles International Airport.</i>
3710257 3711744 Victor. Victor. Victor.
3712002 3713240 Yeah, what's up?
3713326 3714926 Did you pack the radio mikes<br />from the shoot
3714928 3716056 or did you put them in your carry-on?
3716057 3717246 Are you crazy?
3717346 3719520 I would not let those assholes check them in.<br />I love you.
3720100 3721660 Give me one of the receivers.
3726561 3728421 Can you tune in to the cockpit frequency?
3729890 3730741 Yeah. Why?
3731111 3732606 I wanna hear what's going on.
3735606 3737139 Should be right here on our band.
3739009 3739674 Nothing.
3739676 3741590 You just told me it would work.<br />Is it working or not?
3741592 3742789 It is working, but it's...
3742888 3745359 All I'm getting is some<br />kind of airport beacon.
3745965 3746847 It's weird.
3747589 3749202 It's like the tower isn't there.
3752045 3753133 Stay on it.
3755068 3756552 Let me know when there is<br />something there.
3756636 3757375 Ok.
3796706 3799056 Major Grant. We're Blue Light.<br />Rollins, Department of Justice.
3799058 3801013 Trudeau, chief of air operations.
3801097 3803349 Lorenzo, terminal police.
3803433 3805351 You want something, you got it.
3805559 3807990 This is it?<br />One fucking platoon?
3808563 3810033 One crisis, one platoon.
3810266 3812293 Who are you? John McClane.
3812371 3815431 McClane, you showed<br />some balls out there, man.
3815432 3816152 Yeah.
3816154 3818444 Now show some good sense.
3818887 3820241 Let the pros handle this.
3820325 3822921 Well, it looks like the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3823355 3824909 Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?
3825128 3826565 No, not anymore he's not.
3826851 3828920 Now we're here to take<br />Colonel Stuart down.
3829260 3830859 And we will take him down.
3830984 3832315 You see, I served with him.
3832649 3834203 I taught him everything he knows.
3834709 3837045 Well, maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3839836 3840859 Let's hustle!
3841101 3843740 Command post will be set up<br />in the airport police station.
3843910 3847017 I want to be tied in to the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3847019 3848348 Alright, let's do it!
3850807 3851930 Hey, Trudeau.
3854299 3856101 Things just get better or worse?
3860532 3862332 Lights big, portable lights.
3862714 3863889 We set up the field,
3864131 3865695 and then we...<br />Wait for those lunatics
3865710 3867272 to shoot them out?<br />And where do we get those big,
3867273 3868956 portable lights borrow them from Batman?
3869144 3870599 What about the air phone idea?
3870601 3871928 There's 18 planes up there.
3871930 3873619 Only five of them have those phones.
3873657 3876033 We got through to three.<br />We're still trying on the others.
3876217 3878200 That leaves 13 accidents<br />waiting to happen.
3878218 3879448 Are they still bucking headwinds?
3879450 3880260 I just checked the weather.
3880261 3882618 Headwinds are slamming<br />everybody over the outer marker.
3882767 3885119 The planes with enough fuel<br />have already been shunted to Atlanta,
3885121 3886307 Memphis and Nashville.
3887248 3888498 Outer marker.
3889019 3889852 Damn!
3890878 3892124 The outer marker!
3893169 3894340 It's a beacon, right?
3894341 3896479 A radio beacon that sends out<br />this beep, beep, beep
3896481 3897693 so they know they're over it, right?
3897695 3898297 So?
3898298 3900755 So who says that radio signal<br />has to just beep?
3900757 3902281 Right. We switch the frequency,
3902282 3904370 from the tower over<br />to the one in the beacon.
3904677 3905939 We pump up the wattage.
3906044 3909197 And we can talk to our planes and those<br />bastards who did this will never know!
3912542 3913691 Traced the signal.
3914048 3915316 Found it in the luggage area.
3915736 3918056 They've been tapped<br />into your tower chatter all night.
3918492 3920535 Punks stealing luggage, Carmine?
3924486 3926309 How you doing, Telford?<br />No good.
3927079 3929398 I called Langley.<br />They're rigging a portable decoder.
3929422 3930681 It'll be here in two hours.
3930939 3932234 My wife doesn't have two hours.
3932251 3934393 I was only transferred<br />to Grant's team yesterday.
3934505 3936290 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3937353 3939590 The word is nobody's better<br />at this than Major Grant.
3939958 3940819 Attention!
3941032 3942532 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3944592 3946985 I want to hear about the plane<br />those bastards asked for.
3947729 3949291 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.
3949292 3950757 Pilots' briefing room. Now.
3951093 3952109 Keep working.
3952111 3952902 Albertson!
3952903 3954031 Sir!<br />With me.
3954033 3954717 Yes, sir!
3959345 3960510 No civilians.
3971977 3973049 What the fuck?
3973940 3974809 What is it?
3976120 3977523 The outer marker beeper.
3977994 3979700 It isn't beeping.<br />It's talking.
3980318 3982987 <i>Attention all aircraft<br />in Dulles landing pattern.</i>

3995730 3997569 Approximately two hours ago,

4056285 4058336 Hey, you interested in a nice coat?
4058338 4060257 No. It never looked good on me anyway.<br />Come here.
4060626 4062740 Listen, you got to get me<br />up to the pilots' briefing room.
4062741 4063711 They're having a little soiree.
4063713 4066534 I got to hear what they're saying<br />even if I got to put a fucking glass to the door.
4066536 4068125 Which one of these maps gets me in there?<br />Don't touch it!
4068315 4069668 Don't touch it!<br />Find the map, Marvin.
4069670 4072805 I'll find it. You'll mess up my<br />whole damn filing system here.
4072807 4075744 Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.<br />I think that's in the main terminal.
4076035 4077329 So would that be under,
4077737 4079785 P for pilots' briefing room?
4079793 4080585 Now, Marvin.
4080611 4082133 Or maybe it would be under M,
4082485 4083749 for miscellaneous.

4104706 4105514 Gentlemen,
4106689 4108212 tonight the pattern ends.
4109489 4111609 The dominoes will fall no more,
4111610 4113584 and the ramparts will remain upright.
4113888 4116534 Sir, General Esperanza's plane<br />just came on the scope.

4179767 4181961 What the hell you so excited about that for?
4182188 4183802 The code's still punched into this one.
4183930 4184816 You like it?

4304060 4306438 <i>I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.</i>
4310809 4312149 I'll make you a deal, Marvin.
4312867 4314510 You show me a shortcut<br />out to those runways
4314512 4316153 and I'll get you a liner for that coat.
4316237 4319529 Repeat. I cannot circle around<br />to runway 1-5.
4319657 4320527 Shit.
4320957 4322154 Stand by, Falcon.
4324408 4325251 Here, sir.
4325252 4326517 He's coming in from the ocean, sir.
4328796 4331214 <i>A bullet has damaged my instruments.</i>
4331558 4333038 <i>I'm not sure of my bearing</i>
4333254 4335630 <i>and I must make<br />a visual landing immediately.</i>
4335715 4337122 <i>Do you copy, Eagle Nest?</i>
4337528 4338550 Roger, Falcon.
4338634 4340319 <i>That would be 2-5 right.</i><br />What?
4341049 4342679 <i>Repeat, 2-5 right.</i>
4343213 4344501 <i>Roger.</i><br />Make up your fucking mind!
4344551 4345325 <i>Repeat.</i>
4345741 4347664 <i>Runway 2-5 right.</i><br />Oh, we are just up to our ass
4347665 4349061 in terrorists again, John.
4349063 4351341 <i>Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.</i>
4351721 4352654 2-5 right.
4354650 4356417 I got to quit smoking cigarettes.
4357028 4359237 <i>Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.</i>
4359978 4361738 But if you could show it to me as well,
4361739 4363021 <i>I would be grateful.</i>
4374580 4375691 <i>I see the lights.</i>
4376193 4378616 <i>They are directly in front of me.<br />Gracias, compadre.</i>
4379211 4380355 <i>Reducing airspeed.</i>
4380811 4382023 <i>Approaching runway.</i>
4382303 4383348 <i>Wish me luck.</i>
4383694 4384976 Roger, Falcon.
4386916 4388863 We copy.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4389514 4391915 That's right, asshole.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4416305 4417427 <i>I see your lights.</i>
4418101 4419381 <i>E.T.A. 90 seconds.</i>
4428782 4430728 Come to papa, scumbag.
4486455 4487515 Oh, shit!
4548121 4549043 Freedom.
4550530 4551594 Not yet.
4554176 4557060 You're supposed to stay in your seat<br />until the plane reaches the terminal.
4557497 4559353 No frequent-flyer mileage for you.
4559738 4560718 Who are you?
4560943 4561730 A cop.
4561988 4562542 A cop?
4562543 4563962 Yeah, one of the good guys.
4564142 4565474 You see you're one of the bad guys.
4565476 4568378 And now that I got your sorry ass,<br />I'm gonna trade it for my wife.
4577832 4578810 Sit down!
4582229 4583812 I'm going in!<br />I got you covered.
4590052 4591018 Where'd he go?
4591223 4592039 In there.
4602401 4604691 I don't believe this 2 months of planning,
4604939 4607110 and you can't anticipate one<br />pendejo nfa cop.
4607112 4609237 Come on, General.<br />Where the hell is Colonel Stuart?
4613725 4615424 General!<br />I am alright.
4616207 4617486 He said he was a policeman.
4617937 4619516 I thought you had this place secured.
4620061 4621207 He went in the cockpit.
4621792 4622941 He's going to hell!
4624369 4625481 McClane!
4626464 4628303 I assume it's you, McClane.
4629444 4631042 You're quite a little soldier.
4632317 4634555 You can consider this a military funeral!
4660156 4661452 How many grenades we got?
4661454 4662418 Three each!
4663301 4664253 Use them!
4675074 4676045 Oh, fuck.
4678005 4678661 Shit
4690569 4691538 Go!
4708337 4710338 Oh, shit!
4719746 4721199 You lucky fuck.
4724562 4725631 Fire trucks, sir.
4726006 4727240 Fall back to the church.
4727241 4728145 Now!
4750569 4752203 Where's the fucking door?
4767573 4769399 You know they're getting a little<br />nervous back there.
4769406 4770657 In fact, so am I.
4771310 4772404 We're right over Washington.
4772406 4773687 See if you can get any TV.
4773688 4774774 That'll settle them down.
4775356 4776541 Works for me.
4801025 4804017 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the Video Sleaze Awards?
4805275 4806350 Try Pulitzer.
4806351 4807267 <i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>
4807269 4810869 <i>while waiting to land, our cabin attendants<br />are turning on local Washington broadcasting.</i>
4811022 4812572 <i>The sound is on channel three.</i>
4819740 4820483 Ok.
4821756 4822744 Ok. Ok.
4831389 4833481 Please sir, we may land at any moment.
4834382 4835967 If you'll take your seat.<br />I'm gonna be sick.
4835969 4837154 Excuse me. I'm gonna be sick.
4837156 4838714 Sir, the seat belt light is on.
4843722 4844735 Moron.
4845179 4847335 <i>WZDC.</i><br />Yes, this is Richard Thornberg.
4847425 4849003 Put me through to Ruben<br />in the newsroom.
4849448 4851500 <i>He's about to go live.</i><br />I know he's about to go on.
4851502 4852519 That's why I need him.
4852913 4854008 <i>You'll have to hold on.</i>
4854010 4856501 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your résumé.
4858129 4859465 Esperanza's down.
4861177 4862147 But he's hurt.
4863140 4864555 He took a round in his shoulder.
4865231 4866507 Plus I got one more of their guys.
4866509 4867910 That's six they lost altogether.
4867912 4871066 Well maybe if we knew how many<br />they had to start with, we could get excited.
4871079 4872512 But if they got 50 guys,
4872513 4874791 it's a little early to break<br />out the champagne!
4875036 4878791 We appreciate your effort, McClane, but<br />we don't need a loose cannon on this deck!
4878876 4880745 What if they decide<br />to crash another plane
4880746 4882470 in retaliation for your little stunt?
4882472 4884322 They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?
4884763 4887557 Besides, if I grabbed<br />Esperanza, this would all be over by now.
4887641 4890310 Well, maybe they're just<br />a little bit more creative than you think!
4890394 4892144 Well, at least I'm thinking, goddamn it!
4892146 4893614 Listen, you wise-ass,
4893692 4897442 we're here to jerk off that cocksucker<br />until he tries to take off, period!
4897526 4900653 Now you're the wrong guy<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time!
4903457 4904648 The story of my life.
4906287 4907051 Major,
4907230 4908995 Pentagon Situation Room, sir!
4909288 4911241 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.
4911752 4912590 Thank you, Telford.
4912740 4914145 You men come with me.
4917349 4919103 McClane.<br />Yeah, Barnes.
4919392 4921283 You said those guys showed<br />up out there right away?
4921285 4922030 Yeah.
4922032 4924584 So. So that must mean<br />they're on the field or close.
4925439 4926899 And I think I know where.
4927633 4929069 Come here.<br />Let me show you something.
4931685 4935688 These are the old plans when the longer<br />runways went in. That's, that's 12 years ago.
4936393 4938880 Looks like they've done<br />some modifications on-site,
4938882 4942247 moved TRACON phones, I.L.S.,<br />all the underground stuff,
4942450 4944029 so they could handle drainage.
4944323 4945263 If I'm right,
4945264 4947888 all of it would run right<br />along the airport property
4947904 4949679 and go right past this neighborhood.
4953831 4955496 We should have been<br />on the ground two hours ago!
4955579 4957408 I understand,<br />but if you just relax a little.
4957455 4959018 Come on, lady.<br />Who you trying to kid?
4959019 4960046 It's hopeless.
4961342 4964584 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess. That's for sure.
4965632 4968943 Well unfortunately there really isn't anyone<br />we can blame for the weather.
4968973 4969805 Oh, yeah?
4969806 4971734 What about that porker Willard Scott?
4972530 4973893 I should have taken the bus.
4974010 4976973 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4977304 4978277 Excuse me.
4978711 4979471 Yes?
4980637 4981851 I was just wondering.
4982652 4986322 This flight originally was supposed<br />to be five and a half hours, right?
4987335 4990263 Do we have enough fuel<br />to keep circling like this?
4990396 4993190 Oh, of course.<br />They anticipate little problems like this.
5011849 5014434 Barnes, we looked at 12 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
5014815 5016615 This is our last possibility.
5017832 5019522 Over here there is an old church.
5019606 5020365 Let's go.
5025706 5026433 Wait.
5034246 5035804 There's the church over there.
5044478 5045799 Could be a sentry.
5045800 5047759 And he could just be out for a walk.
5048015 5050475 Then why is he going over<br />his own footsteps?
5053232 5054143 Come on.
5056669 5057366 Alright.
5058378 5060222 Just stay here and get<br />ready to call the marines.
5060415 5061776 I thought they were the army.
5062031 5064023 Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
5081252 5082160 Oh, shit.
5084236 5085129 Not now.
5099587 5101515 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
5101520 5103776 <i>Barnes, where the hell did you go?<br />Where's McClane?</i>
5103823 5104492 He's with me.
5104493 5107007 We're at the Highland Lake Community<br />Church on the west side of the airport.
5107233 5108183 You're where?
5108184 5110435 Goddamn it!<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't...
5110437 5111729 <i>This must be their base of operations.</i>
5111730 5113688 <i>Shut up and get your ass over here!<br />Move it!</i>
5113783 5115336 Code red! Sit rep.
5116203 5118456 We got positive I.D. on Stuart's location.
5118457 5119163 Let's move.
5119345 5120800 Yo!<br />Yes, sir.
5131552 5134178 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
5136306 5138269 If there are no more surprises.
5153403 5155904 Gentlemen, we have a situation here.
5233855 5234654 Over here.
5247899 5250151 Geez, McClane, you alright?<br />You want a medic?
5250337 5253506 McClane, what the hell you think<br />you're doing out there, playing John Wayne?
5253590 5255841 How would you like<br />to spend the night in a cell?
5255843 5258341 Lorenzo, shut the fuck up<br />and do something useful.
5258342 5259470 Go seal off the street.
5259513 5261658 Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
5261791 5262847 Oh, no, Carmine?
5263019 5266811 Sergeant, get this bureaucrat<br />out of Mr. McClane's face now.
5266895 5268387 With pleasure, sir.
5271142 5271916 Major,
5272759 5274277 the men are in position, sir.
5274513 5276445 Close up the back.<br />Then we go in.
5276467 5277709 Fire only on my order.
5277711 5278754 Roger that, sir.
5279337 5280786 Guess I was wrong about you.
5281574 5283494 You're not such an asshole after all.
5283903 5285030 No, you were right.
5285519 5287164 Well I'm just your kind of asshole.
5296446 5298217 Garber, sit rep!
5298872 5300801 Army Special Forces on three sides,
5300802 5302461 closing in fast around the back!
5302463 5303778 Another problem, Colonel?
5303779 5305076 No problem, General.
5305946 5307955 Gentlemen, you know what to do.
5319843 5321606 Down!<br />Get down! Get down!
5350435 5351243 General!
5352453 5353285 It's time.
5360316 5361633 Come on. Let's move it!
5376998 5378923 They're pulling out!<br />What?
5379007 5380004 Out the back!
5387933 5388717 Move it!
5399209 5401185 Albertson, take your men<br />around the back.
5427844 5429804 This equipment,<br />it could land our planes.
5429936 5430973 Don't touch anything.
5430975 5432337 There were trip wires outside.
5432338 5433557 They could have booby-trapped...<br />They did.
5433753 5436962 Got one here. Looks like C-4.<br />The motherfucker is armed.
5437188 5438962 Clear the area!<br />Everybody, now!
5443400 5445007 They booby-trapped all the equipment.
5445009 5446448 Seal off the building!<br />Shit!
5447374 5449451 Secure the area.<br />Post sentries. No civilians allowed.
5449846 5452353 Hey, where the fuck is McClane?
5502160 5503391 Miller, take him!
5505654 5506708 I'll cover you!
5530938 5531788 Goddamn!
5553896 5555702 So much for the element of chance.
5557329 5558274 Let's move out.
5576419 5578006 I had the bastard in my sights.
5578068 5579185 I know I did.
5589960 5591332 Oh, Jesus Christ.
5596683 5597892 <i>Attention, Tower.</i>
5597893 5599587 <i>Attention, Dulles Tower.</i>
5599830 5602140 <i>This is Colonel Stuart.<br />Is our plane prepared?</i>
5602718 5604395 It is.<br />It's in Hangar 11.
5604397 5606122 It's the most remote building we've got.
5607444 5608856 We're on our way.
5609549 5612592 <i>Have a ground crew there<br />to confirm the condition of the plane.</i>
5613549 5615992 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5616623 5619747 Colonel, you're quite capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5619831 5622982 <i>Now please, don't ask us<br />to gift wrap potential hostages for you.</i>
5622999 5624403 Major Grant, isn't it?
5624825 5626188 <i>If you remember me Colonel,</i>
5626691 5628756 <i>then you remember I know<br />the drill as well as you do.</i>
5630208 5632137 Check out your own fucking plane.
5632866 5634319 We move out in five minutes.
5634926 5636531 Flak-jackets for everybody.
5636851 5638489 Body armor for the assault team.
5638913 5640532 Night scopes for the snipers.
5641165 5644007 We will take them in the hangar,<br />and I will pull that detonator
5644009 5646487 out of Stuart's dead fucking hand myself.
5647819 5648740 Lorenzo,
5649070 5650742 take all your men back to the airport. Sir.
5650744 5652186 Seal off every exit
5652512 5654258 in case any of them tries to slip past us,
5654326 5655742 to break out onto the ground.
5655743 5656886 You got it.
5659217 5661078 Alright, here we go.
5661985 5664808 <i>Dick, this is nuts. Every station<br />in town has people at the airport</i>
5664810 5666920 <i>and none has heard<br />a whisper of this shit you're running!</i>
5666922 5670089 Well, none of them is me.<br />You want proof? Try this.
5670864 5673470 <i>Repeat.<br />Terrorists have murdered civilians</i>
5673585 5676184 <i>and cut off the two systems<br />that can allow you to land.</i>
5676689 5679209 <i>A special U.S. Army unit is already here</i>
5679637 5681478 <i>and preparing to take out the terrorists.</i><br />Jesus Christ.
5681813 5683267 <i>I want you to go live now.</i>
5683329 5685288 <i>Key me in from the files<br />a publicity shot, whatever.</i>
5685290 5687187 Connie's got one and a map.<br />Steal one from weather.
5687189 5688234 We're on it. We're on it.
5688235 5689560 We're cutting in five minutes!
5690126 5692448 Tell the affiliates if they want in,<br />they got three minutes to shout.
5692662 5693741 Let's do this.
5695278 5696624 Network, here I come.
5700178 5704173 Hey Telford, what was your chickenshit<br />outfit doing while we were taking Grenada?
5707196 5708068 Grenada,
5708834 5711699 five minutes of firefight,<br />five weeks of surfing.
5712383 5713978 I wish I was with you guys for that.
5714345 5715208 Yeah.
5715455 5716455 Me too, kid.
5717004 5717963 Really, sir?
5718396 5719303 Sure.
5720700 5722356 Then we would not have to do this.
5738058 5740133 Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.
5741140 5742414 On schedule
5743096 5744079 and in position.
5744295 5746457 Roger, Hatchling.<br />We are secure here.
5746939 5748339 You have a green light.
5748600 5749595 I repeat,
5749924 5751282 a green light.
5762923 5764373 Jesus Officer,
5764374 5766456 where'd you come from, Pearl Harbor?
5771827 5773226 Alright, let's clear it out, please.
5775729 5776612 Stand by.
5777672 5779547 Five, four, three
5780799 5783742 <i>This is a special bulletin from WZDC News.</i>
5783826 5786197 <i>There was a plane crash<br />earlier this evening at Dulles,</i>
5786251 5788252 <i>where other aircraft continue to circle,</i>
5788325 5791064 <i>with no explanation from airport<br />or F.A.A. officials.</i>
5791165 5794396 Quiet!<br /><i>And now, with an exclusive WZDC report</i>
5794654 5797528 <i>here's Dick Thornberg reporting<br />from the skies over Washington.</i>
5797535 5798295 Can you turn it up?
5798448 5801964 <i>I'm one of the thousand people who<br />has been circling our nation's capital</i>
5802062 5804070 <i>under the assumption<br />that whatever problem</i>
5804071 5806538 <i>was going on far below<br />was a normal one.</i>
5807105 5809027 <i>But the truth is far from normal.</i>
5809395 5810964 <i>The truth is terrifying.</i>
5811120 5813709 Look out!<br />Lady, look out!
5814567 5816492 Look out! Look out!
5816493 5817903 Look out! Look out!<br />Get out of the way!
5818881 5820027 Get out of the way!
5820055 5821827 Move!<br />Get out of the way, lady!
5821902 5823746 Go! Go! Hey!<br />Hey! Look out!
5824035 5826116 This is a recording of a conversation,
5826118 5829045 between Dulles Tower<br />and the captive aircraft overhead.
5831282 5833192 Hey! Get out of the way!
5833541 5834805 Scary!<br />Lorenzo!
5835554 5836492 Lorenzo!
5836979 5838630 McClane, are you out of your fucking mind?
5838632 5839631 The Blue Light Team, where are they?
5839633 5842873 Stuart's got explosives on the equipment<br />in the church rigged with a remote.
5842887 5843512 Where's Grant?
5843538 5845865 Grant's boys are gonna kill that<br />son of a bitch and get it problems.
5845867 5847696 They're gonna do, they're gonna<br />get on the same goddanm plane
5847697 5848568 with him and take off with him!
5848594 5849777 Get the fuck out of here!
5849779 5850990 When the army canned Stuart,
5850991 5852588 he must have loaded<br />that unit with his own men!
5852613 5854494 Are you nuts? That firefight out...
5854495 5856607 That firefight Sideshow to jerk us off,<br />buy them some time.
5856609 5858776 McClane, you are completely<br />around the fucking bend.
5858778 5860795 You know that and you know<br />what else you're under arrest.
5860821 5861747 You motherfucker!
5868225 5868923 Here!
5869076 5870873 These are the bullets<br />they used out there tonight!
5871309 5872231 Blanks!
5875493 5876556 Jesus Christ.
5884721 5886480 <i>This is Chief Lorenzo.</i>
5886764 5888411 <i>I want every officer recalled</i>
5888412 5890468 <i>and assembled in body<br />armor and full weaponry</i>
5890470 5892185 <i>in the motor pool in five minutes.</i>
5894939 5896575 It's time to kick ass.
5899068 5901445 Just like lwo Jima!
5901447 5904317 <i>Since then, this reporter<br />has learned that the terrorists</i>
5904319 5906756 <i>have virtual control of the entire airport.</i>
5907478 5909933 <i>A fact that the authorities have repressed.</i>
5910372 5912361 <i>The terrorists promise more bloodshed</i>
5912363 5914176 <i>unless their demands are met.</i>
5914375 5917547 And now that the special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport,
5917962 5922026 the likelihood of a full-scale<br />and deadly battle is dangerously close.
5943780 5946865 That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.
5947112 5948580 It's all over the airport.
5954001 5956160 <i>And unfortunately they may not be the last.</i>
5956871 5959628 <i>The horrifying fact is that no one is safe,</i>
5960170 5963273 <i>either in the planes above Dulles<br />or in the terminal below.</i>
5964044 5966718 <i>The threat of a new and higher<br />body count at the airport</i>
5966803 5968902 <i>hangs over the heads of everyone</i>
5969138 5972828 <i>and the holiday season<br />of peace and love has become a nightmare.</i>
5979739 5981544 Alright, listen up all units!
5981897 5984340 I want you to converge on Hangar 11.
5984537 5985462 All sides!
5985840 5987488 This car, McClane! Get in!
5987981 5990526 When the city blue show up<br />with their backup,
5990770 5993602 they'll pick up the pieces!<br />Now, move out!
5994842 5996834 McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.
5997656 5999024 Merry Christmas.
5999964 6000675 Hi.

6011670 6013264 I didn't even see you, man.
6013266 6015917 Will you move that goddamn<br />piece of shit out of here!
6016075 6020346 Vito, get the fuck out of the car and get your<br />ass in gear and help me, for Christ's sake!
6020677 6024317 Will you get move that car back right now, lady!
6024402 6025838 Right there. Right there.<br />Get that.

6032907 6034018 Hey, Coleman!
6034434 6035147 Hi!
6035522 6036390 Coleman!
6038064 6039483 But at least the truth,
6040059 6041663 is not among the hostages,
6042121 6043377 because I,
6043742 6046239 Richard Thornberg,<br />just happened to be here,
6046966 6048259 to put his life...
6048799 6049718 and talent,
6050473 6052315 on the line for humanity
6052479 6053340 and country.
6053342 6055598 And if this should be my final broadcast
6058405 6059689 Amen to that,
6060192 6060826 Dick.
6061981 6062584 <i>Dick?</i>
6063216 6064224 <i>We're live, Dick.</i>
6065130 6066238 <i>Where are you now?</i>
6066646 6067427 <i>Dick?</i>
6069905 6071490 Truck lights approaching, sir.
6071574 6072467 <i>They're here,</i>
6072468 6073648 <i>right on schedule.</i>
6074598 6076187 The hangar door, open it.
6077094 6078039 Clockwork.
6101799 6104174 Geez, you give me this story,<br />and I'll have your baby.
6105858 6107618 Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.
6119710 6122733 Colonel, if I may say so,<br />you are some piece of work.
6122897 6123956 Thank you, Major.
6124260 6126065 You're not so bad yourself.
6126337 6128255 Congratulations on your escape, sir.
6128339 6129164 Thank you, Major.
6129752 6131933 Maybe you should save them<br />until we are all safe?
6132565 6134758 Sir.<br />My congratulations, gentlemen.
6135325 6137430 You've won a victory for our way of life
6137515 6139414 my pride, my admiration,

6141394 6142603 Now get on board.
6173794 6175136 What's the matter cowboy,<br />ride too rough?
6175137 6176302 I don't like to fly.
6176612 6178790 Then what are you doing here?<br />I don't like to lose either.
6179669 6181511 Ok!<br />Here we go!
6191078 6194565 I don't know about you guys, but I've seen<br />enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime.
6195087 6196884 They don't get much of that<br />in the tropics, Major.
6197125 6198135 For you, gentlemen,
6198136 6199413 we'll import it.
6202553 6203967 Shit! They left the hangar!

6212946 6214758 Block their path<br />so they can't get out of there!
6214842 6216663 I'm not playing chicken<br />with a 200-ton plane!
6216664 6218745 I'm crazy man, but I ain't that crazy.<br />Forget it.

6342678 6343552 John,
6343980 6346389 what the fuck are you doing<br />out on the wing of this plane?
6354157 6354870 Damn!
6360491 6361988 Mierda.<br />What?
6362073 6363544 There's something wrong.
6364665 6365920 The ailerons.
6366327 6367554 We can't take off.
6371374 6372786 Hijo de puta.
6373513 6374792 It's McClane again.

6379110 6380292 I'll do him.
6381533 6382552 This time do it right.
6382554 6384330 You just get us in the air, General.
6384549 6386035 You're the only man who can do it.
6386037 6388201 Don't shoot.<br />That wing is fully fueled.
6440877 6442092 Too bad, McClane.
6442382 6443712 I kind of liked you!
6444717 6445963 Goddamn traitor!
6451579 6453129 I got enough friends!

6710504 6713181 They used the fire to see!<br />They used the fucking fire to see!
6713183 6714887 They can all do that. Let's tell them.
6715752 6716666 They already know.
6716668 6719194 <i>We had a visual on Northeastern's landing.</i><br />Listen.
6719196 6721279 <i>They were following<br />the fire trail in as a guide.</i>
6721545 6723089 <i>If they can do it, so can we!</i>
6741826 6744061 Any landing you can walk<br />away from is a good one.
6744062 6744778 That's great.

6869533 6871346 I thought I was never gonna<br />see you again.
6871823 6873552 That's what I thought about you.
6874274 6875690 I love you so much.
6879995 6882341 They told me there were<br />terrorists at the airport.
6882886 6885084 Yeah. I heard that too.
