52120 56100 At the age of 26,<br />Ludwig van Beethoven went deaf,
56200 60460 ending his career as a<br />successful concert pianist.
60560 63100 But determined not to let a<br />little thing like his hearing
63200 64740 end his music career,
64840 67500 my pal Ludwig became a composer.
67600 70340 Turned out the new gig suited him.
70440 72140 It's like that old saying,
72240 76020 "Life is what happens when<br />you're busy making other plans."
76120 77500 Take my dad.
77600 79220 When my little brother,<br />Teddy, was born,
79320 80860 he quit his band to get a real job.
80960 83900 But then he fell in<br />love with teaching.
84000 85980 Now he spends his<br />days in the mosh pit
86080 88500 that is high school English class.
88600 91380 Or my mom, a riot girl<br />who found her calling
91480 95900 as a part-time travel agent<br />and a full-time supermom.
96000 97740 These days, she only<br />moshes with Teddy.
97840 99944 Scooch over, dude.
101320 103260 And then there's me.
103360 105220 I thought I knew where I was going.
105320 108380 I thought I had it all mapped out.
108480 111180 Turns out, I had no idea.
111280 113620 Your coffee, maestro.
113720 115060 - Thank you.<br />- Me too. I want some!
115160 116260 No way, dude.
116360 118620 You don't give crack to somebody<br />who's already on speed.
118720 120380 Don't worry,<br />we switched him to decaf.
120480 122820 - Whoa. As long as you don't switch me.<br />- No, baby,
122920 124626 that would be child abuse.
124960 127110 Hey, did you see this?
130400 132620 I got a Google Alert<br />about it yesterday.
132720 134460 It's the most we've seen<br />of him in a few months.
134560 136505 I know.
138440 140620 Oh, my God, is he really<br />opening up for The Shins?
140720 143180 Yeah. When they play<br />in Portland tonight.
143280 144300 That's huge.
144400 146868 Yeah, I know. It's kind of crazy.
147320 149140 Everything he's ever wanted's<br />actually coming true.
149240 150500 I know you guys haven't<br />been talking much lately.
150600 151900 Mom, I really don't want<br />to talk about it, okay?
152000 155820 I'm just saying that if you miss<br />each other it's okay to reach out.
155920 156940 Okay!
157040 158820 Come on. If you guys<br />want a ride, we got to go.
158920 161580 Now let's update you on the<br />snowstorm and school closures.
161680 162740 Baby, turn that up.
162840 163820 Portland and Clackamas counties
163920 165020 are now calling for a snow day.
165120 168540 All schools in Portland and Clackamas<br />districts will be closed for the day.
168640 170140 Yes! That means no school, kids.
170240 171500 Well, ain't that a bitch?
171600 174102 School's out forever!
176040 178820 Did you really just<br />quote Alice Cooper?
178920 180700 My God, son, have I<br />taught you nothing?
180800 182260 Let's go make a snow monster.
182360 185020 We can try. It looks like it's not<br />really sticking out there, though.
185120 186940 You guys are all playing<br />hooky without me?
187040 188500 It's not hooky if it's a snow day.
188600 189780 So not fair.
189880 191860 - Life isn't fair.<br />- That is true.
191960 194340 But sometimes you got to,<br />like, noodge it a little.
195960 197820 It'd be bad to go to<br />work with this cough,
197920 200627 spreading my germs around.
205080 206580 You know how when you meet someone
206680 209820 and they just already are the<br />person they're meant to be?
209920 211060 That was Adam.
211160 213700 Nobody outside Portland<br />had ever heard of his band.
213800 216540 But he already was somebody.
216640 219791 Everybody knew who he was.
221760 223220 Me?
223320 225185 Not so much.
242440 244260 What class was this?
244360 246060 Advanced Composition.
246160 247380 What's she doing?
247480 249900 She's more advanced.
250000 252300 Adam. What's up?
257800 260621 I think everyone left.
261400 264340 Let's get some lunch.<br />I am Starvin' Marvin.
264440 265660 Oh, and, by the way,
265760 268140 that Adam rocker dude was<br />totally checking you out.
268240 269940 Adam Wilde saw me geeking out?
270040 272100 He saw you blissing out<br />and he was into it.
272200 275380 No, he isn't "into it," Kim.
275480 277020 Yeah, he is, Mia.
277120 278420 He's way into you.
278520 280180 Do not take his picture, Kim.
280280 282623 I'm not an amateur.
285360 286700 You're welcome.
289400 290940 Over the next couple of weeks
291040 295067 I noticed Adam hanging around<br />while I was practicing my cello.
298400 299947 You're Mia.
300360 302020 - Yeah.<br />- Good.
302120 303380 I just wanted to clear that up.
303480 304660 There were rumors.
304760 305820 I'm Adam.
305920 307460 I kno...
307560 308860 Hi.
308960 309980 Wow.
310080 311940 Yo-Yo Ma much?
312040 313020 Kinda.
313120 314260 What's the deal with that?
314360 316500 Is that, like, street or something?<br />Yo-Yo Mama?
316600 317620 It's Chinese.
317720 319620 And don't mock the master.
319720 322260 - It's blasphemous.<br />- I'm sorry, my bad.
322360 324430 Hey, I got some tickets<br />to see a cellist.
324760 325740 Really?
325840 328502 Yeah. You interested?
329760 331140 You're asking me on a date?
331240 335060 Yeah. Well, a friend of the family<br />had the tickets and can't go.
335160 338743 Anyhow, it's this Friday.<br />I could pick you up.
339400 340580 What?
340680 342660 You can't hide in that<br />rehearsal room forever.
342760 344500 It's too late.
344600 346784 I see you.
347440 349180 Hey.
349280 350740 I'm Kim.
350840 352466 Hi.
353040 354871 Okay. I'll see you guys later.
356080 357581 Bye.
357800 360380 Oh, my God!
360480 361460 What?
361560 363500 I told you he was into you.
363600 367540 No, no. He just had a question<br />about classical music and...
367640 369346 Okay.
369920 371020 Better be nice to you or else
371120 372780 I'll crush him like the bug he is.
373960 377100 God, all right, we get it.<br />You're in love! Go away!
377200 379140 You got two types of girls<br />in this world, Mia.
379240 380700 Girls who have boyfriends<br />in high school...
380800 382780 And girls like us who<br />wait till college.
382880 385144 So much happier.
386200 387980 I'm totally off the hook.
388080 390660 What are we doing today?
390760 393620 We can go the farm, visit<br />Henry, Willow and the baby?
393720 395540 Stop by my folks' place<br />for a late lunch?
395640 397980 Mia, you gonna come with us?
398080 399060 I don't know.
399160 400820 There's this tricky part<br />of the Beethoven sonata
400920 403980 that I've really gotta nail,
404080 406460 and, well, the letters<br />were mailed on Friday.
406560 407580 Juilliard.
407680 409700 The audition was two months ago,
409800 412580 but I can still feel<br />it in my fingers.
412680 415060 Okay, this is painful to watch.
415160 417660 Look, who knows what time the mail's<br />even gonna be delivered today?
417760 420340 Come on, you got to come with us.
420440 422460 Come on, baby. Pretty soon<br />you're gonna be off to college,
422560 423820 no matter where you're going.
423920 426340 How many snow days are we gonna<br />be able to spend together?
426440 429420 Are you really playing<br />the guilt card right now?
429520 430740 We'll let you pick the music.
430840 432340 And bribery.
432440 435140 Honey, guilt and bribery are<br />the glue that have held
435240 438260 parents and teenagers<br />together for generations.
438360 440740 Don't fight tradition.
440840 442260 Fine.
442360 443980 Boom!
445640 448381 I am a passenger
449280 451500 And I ride and I ride...
451600 453940 I thought you said<br />I'd pick the music.
454040 456900 Oh, yah. She's right, Teddy.<br />Fire up the jams, sister.
457000 458340 Let's hear something old-school.
458440 459980 How 'bout I kick out a few tunes
460080 462780 from our favorite<br />Austrian melody maker,
462880 464300 Franz Schubert.
464400 466060 Not that old-school.
466160 468380 Iggy Pop! Iggy Pop!
468480 470620 Teddy, you can listen<br />to Iggy on your iPod.
470720 472660 But nothing after 1978.
472760 474940 - You understand me, young man?<br />- Yes, sir.
475040 477580 Well, I choose Ludwig van Beethoven.
477680 479140 Surprise.
497760 498980 I've always wondered if
499080 500140 Mom and Dad were disappointed
500240 502220 that I didn't turn<br />out more like them.
502320 506020 I tried to. I mean, Mom and I<br />went to all of Dad's shows.
506120 509420 Dad's band was called Nasty Bruises.
509520 511660 Embarrassing, I know.
511760 513660 They were what you might<br />call "big" in our town.
513760 516900 And for a while, everyone<br />thought they might get bigger.
519600 522671 That was my preschool.
523400 526665 But then one day in second grade...
531600 533780 I wanna play it.
535000 537380 Cellos are crazy expensive.
537480 540260 So, I borrowed a crappy<br />one from school.
540360 543260 Mom and Dad found a student<br />from a local college to teach me.
543360 545660 And I rehearsed day and night.
545760 547989 I couldn't get enough.
548760 550020 I love her.
550120 552820 But I'm about ready to<br />stab my eyeballs out.
552920 555020 This is exactly why I<br />could never procreate.
555120 556780 Amen, sister.
560520 563300 I loved the order.
563400 565660 The structure.
565760 570060 But what really hooked me was<br />that feeling I got in my chest.
571440 574989 It's like my heart was<br />beating with the cello.
601400 603265 Dude.
604200 607624 She's been at it since<br />this afternoon.
609560 611980 You want me to tell her to<br />hang it up for the night?
612080 613706 No.
614880 617100 You go in there you'd probably<br />get clubbed with a bow.
617200 619509 I wouldn't risk it.
621040 623260 I wonder where she gets that from.
623360 627460 Naw, guys play music for two reasons.
627560 630740 To get laid and because<br />they got rage.
630840 633220 But mostly to get laid.
633320 636471 Well, that's probably<br />not her motivation.
637560 639903 No. Exactly.
640800 642220 She's not doing it to get anything.
642320 645300 She's just doing it out of pure...
651280 653748 We made that.
667040 670940 The next day, Dad came<br />home with a present.
671040 674350 A cello of my very own.
705880 708460 Isn't it amazing how life<br />is one thing and then,
708560 711660 in an instant,<br />it becomes something else?
711760 714300 Like here I am, Mia.
714400 716500 The girl who thinks about<br />the cello and Adam
716600 720627 and whether a letter is<br />waiting for me at home.
721120 723270 And just like that...
778400 781220 Get some cribbing in there.<br />Support those columns.
781320 782420 We need a full spinal immobilization.
782520 784067 Hello?
784400 786100 Our resources are good right now.
786200 787260 Excuse me!
787360 789180 Sir, excuse me?
789280 790620 Hello?
798560 800221 Mom.
800840 802626 Teddy!
802920 804865 Dad!
813240 815300 We have foreshortening<br />in this left leg.
815400 816901 Yeah.
824280 825980 Do you wanna get a tube in her now?
826080 828180 Just grab the Ambu bag for now.
828280 830270 No!
836640 838580 Wake up!
838680 840511 Wake up.
842120 844110 Wake up.
850520 853068 Go, one, two, three.
853800 855740 Let's move. Her Glasgow<br />Coma's at a seven.
855840 857580 Tell Portland to have<br />a trauma team ready.
858480 861620 Glasgow Coma? Why do<br />you need a trauma team?
861720 864180 One female, late teens, critical,<br />en route to Portland now.
864280 867260 - One 8-year-old male, conscious.<br />- Mom! Dad!
867360 868380 Teddy!
868480 870391 Let's go, Demetri.
870760 874070 Hang in there, baby.<br />We'll be in Portland soon.
886320 887500 You okay?
887600 888620 No.
888720 890620 You wanna hit up my closet?
890720 893302 Your closet's terrifying.
893600 895340 I don't even wanna go.
895440 897260 Come on, he's just a guy, Mia.
897360 900060 Yeah, but he's the first guy I've<br />ever gone on a maybe-date with
900160 903420 and I don't know whether to wear<br />date clothes or casual clothes or...
903520 906500 Just wear, you know,<br />something you feel good in.
906600 909740 And if this Adam dude doesn't see how<br />amazing you are, then he's a total...
909840 910860 - Shithead.<br />- Yeah.
912480 915108 Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.
917600 920068 Better before than during.
922480 923580 You must be Adam.
923680 925100 Yeah. I am, yeah.
925200 926420 Nice threads.
926520 928740 Come on in. I'm the old man, Denny.
928840 931020 I know. You were in<br />Nasty Bruises, right?
931120 932980 Oh, wow,<br />you're impressing me already.
933080 935100 Well, I have your CDs.
935200 936740 You're the one.
936840 939660 They make great coasters,<br />right? Come on.
939760 941940 Adam's here!
942040 943100 Is that Mia?
943200 945900 Yeah. That's our<br />little rock and roll.
946000 948940 She was Nasty Bruises'<br />original groupie.
949040 952100 Oh, no. Is he telling<br />you old war stories?
952200 953701 Hey.
953960 956020 - We should probably go.<br />- 'Kay.
956120 957460 'Kay, you kids be careful out there.
957560 959740 I hear it gets pretty<br />wild at the symphony.
959840 960940 - Goodbye.<br />- Bye.
961040 962621 Bye.
962880 964860 Your parents seem pretty cool.
964960 967020 So they tell me.
1023280 1025180 Seriously, I respect any musician
1025280 1027140 who just leaves it all<br />on the stage like that.
1027240 1028260 She was awesome.
1028360 1030060 Thought you were a little<br />bored there in the beginning.
1030160 1032660 No. That snoring was<br />the lady next to me.
1032760 1034944 I loved every minute of it.
1035600 1037909 All right, Hall,<br />so what's your story?
1038120 1042466 How did parents like yours end<br />up having a kid like you?
1043200 1046943 Well, I was certainly<br />bred to be a rocker.
1047200 1049660 But I have this theory that<br />I was switched at birth.
1049760 1052069 Okay. That explains it.
1053320 1055310 No, but seriously.
1056480 1058860 I don't know,<br />I've always kind of felt like
1058960 1062020 this Martian in my family.
1062120 1064588 I don't look like<br />either of my parents.
1064800 1068900 My mom's this tough chick<br />and my dad's all outgoing
1069000 1073300 and I went and chose<br />Beethoven and the cello.
1073840 1076220 When I was eight,<br />I saw this old video
1076320 1079740 of the Ramones playing<br />"I Wanna Be Sedated".
1079840 1082140 And it felt like my head exploded.
1082240 1085860 And I was like, "I have to<br />learn to play the guitar."
1085960 1089589 So, my uncle hooked me<br />up with this old Fender.
1091360 1095182 Yeah, that thing saved my life.
1106120 1110022 You didn't really get those tickets<br />from a family friend, did you?
1110520 1113500 That was two weeks<br />of pizza delivery tips.
1113600 1115340 Why?
1116600 1117700 Why me?
1117800 1119790 Because I like to watch you play.
1120000 1122548 You go to another place.
1123680 1125705 And you're beautiful.
1128160 1132710 You get this crease in<br />your forehead right there.
1135360 1139831 Why do I have this feeling you're<br />about to mess up my entire life?
1139960 1142701 A little mess never hurt anybody.
1152920 1155620 A week later, Adam invited<br />me to see his band play.
1155720 1157180 Liz, Mia. Mia, Liz.

1254680 1256860 Right on. I love classic rock.
1266600 1267660 Mia!
1267760 1269820 Hey. Are you okay?
1269920 1271540 Kinda miscommunicating with people.
1271640 1272700 The usual.
1272800 1274940 Yo, Adam. After-party at Darren's.<br />You comin'?
1275040 1276420 Yeah. Yeah, we're in. Yeah.
1276520 1278500 - You in?<br />- I have my curfew.
1278600 1280420 - Curfew?<br />- Yeah.
1280520 1282021 Okay.
1283200 1285065 Well, we'll set you loose early.
1292280 1294780 Thanks for slummin'<br />it with us tonight.
1294880 1296780 Yeah. No problem.
1296880 1300543 Yo, Adam, just kiss her<br />and let's go, man.
1300720 1303302 Come on.
1305360 1306900 We're cool, right?
1307000 1308260 - You and me?<br />- Yeah.
1308360 1310100 We're cool.
1310200 1311300 Hey, you finally got to meet Liz.
1311400 1313026 Yeah.
1313200 1315225 You two have a lot in common.
1315360 1316907 You ever, like,
1317080 1318420 hooked up, or...
1318520 1320260 Actually, I'm glad<br />you brought that up.
1320360 1322060 We do have a lot in common.
1322160 1323940 For instance, we're both
1324040 1325746 into girls.
1326080 1328389 She's with Astrid.
1329560 1331140 Oh, wow!
1331240 1333220 Go, Astrid.
1333320 1336266 And now we've got<br />that out of the way.
1338720 1341060 I'm bummed you can't<br />stay out with us tonight.
1341160 1343264 Yeah, I know.
1344760 1346420 Mia, just go. Have fun.
1346520 1348740 - Mom?<br />- Kat! Get away from the window.
1348840 1350705 - Dad?<br />- Sorry.
1351360 1352820 Like, your mom and dad are<br />cool with you staying out,
1352920 1355070 but you don't want to, or...
1357400 1361791 Look, I think I'm coming<br />down with something.
1363560 1365107 Right.
1365240 1369620 Yeah, well, just give me a<br />shout when you get over it.
1369720 1371020 I'll see you around.
1371120 1372980 - Hey, Adam.<br />- Mom, get back inside.
1373080 1375620 We always do these stragglers'<br />dinners on Sunday.
1375720 1377260 You should come by some time.
1377360 1378660 Thanks.
1378760 1380625 Maybe I'll check it out.
1384120 1387624 You know, that was wrong<br />on so many levels.
1393920 1396220 What? She shouldn't be scared<br />to hang out with those guys.
1396320 1397700 They're us.
1397800 1399660 Exactly.
1404760 1407228 - Okay, bring her out.<br />- Behind.
1408400 1411141 No palpable deformities at this time.
1411800 1413586 Go, go, go.
1415320 1416460 What do we got here?
1416560 1417580 Collapsed lung, broken ribs.
1417680 1418660 Looks like three.
1418760 1419740 Abrasions to the legs, face.
1419840 1421220 Brain contusions,<br />full extent unknown.
1421320 1422700 And an internal bleed.
1422800 1424060 Rest of the family's on the way in.
1424160 1426700 Ultrasound, X-ray, 12-chem,<br />type and cross-match.
1426800 1428700 Let's get the RT down here, please.
1428800 1431871 On my count. One, two, three.
1434840 1437100 Hey, excuse me, I need<br />to check on my family.
1437200 1440101 It's Kathleen Hall,<br />Dennis Hall and Theodore Hall?
1440840 1442830 - Good to go.<br />- Hello?
1443360 1445100 Hey, I was trying to look at that.
1445200 1446580 Ruptured spleen, we need to move.
1446680 1449340 We're taking Mia Hall<br />into operating room one.
1449440 1451420 All right, let's get her in there.
1451520 1452980 We got to remove the spleen,<br />drain the lung
1453080 1454260 and figure out what's<br />causing the bleed.
1454360 1456100 If she wants to live,<br />she better start fighting.
1456200 1458700 Start fighting? How am I<br />supposed to start fighting?
1458800 1462060 Someone just talk to me, please!<br />Just help me.
1470840 1472780 Okay, let's go, folks.
1472880 1474666 Her sutures.
1475240 1476300 Arterial line set.
1476400 1477460 Okay, let's get it cleaned up.
1477560 1478820 Your cut-down tray's almost prepped.
1478920 1480460 Let's go, let's go.
1480560 1482140 Thank you.
1482240 1483620 GCS still looks high.
1483720 1485824 Am I gonna die?
1486560 1488710 Is that what this is?
1489480 1491740 Here's the secret, baby.
1491840 1494300 You control this whole thing.
1494400 1497620 If you live, if you die,<br />it's all up to you.
1497720 1500871 So, whatever fight you got in you,<br />you got to pull it out now.
1506240 1508260 Call the blood bank.<br />I need two units of O neg.
1508360 1509620 Keep two on hold.
1509720 1511220 I think we're gonna need<br />a lot more than that.
1511320 1513140 Let's see if we can track<br />down her relatives, please.
1513240 1514180 Right away, sir.
1514280 1517386 One of her parents is on<br />their way to OR four now.
1520920 1522467 Dad?
1522600 1524660 We just have to relieve the swelling.
1524760 1527342 For a guy who was in such a bad<br />car wreck, he really lucked out.
1527760 1531104 Hey, Mia! Look what I<br />found loitering out front.
1531360 1533305 Do we want him?
1535120 1536951 I was hungry.
1537720 1539980 Well, I'm glad you came.
1540080 1543860 Because you're hungry and we<br />have food for you to eat, or...
1543960 1546064 Well, food to eat is my favorite.
1546200 1549180 Out of my way, people. I just worked<br />a double and I need to feast.
1549280 1551220 I'm eatin' dim sum for a twosome.
1551320 1552380 Hey, what's up, Willow?
1552480 1555020 Welcome, Adam. It's nice to see ya.
1555120 1557380 Play your cards right,<br />we might make you a regular.
1557480 1560700 - Okay, Mom, we got it.<br />- Thanks.
1560800 1562586 Come on.
1574800 1577180 Okay, so who is it?<br />Bobby Schayer from Bad Religion.
1577280 1579380 - Tim Leitch from FEAR.<br />- Tim Leitch from FEAR.
1579480 1581180 - The guy from Dead Moon.<br />- Andrew Loomis.
1581280 1584340 And the guy from<br />The Wipers, Sam Henry.
1584440 1585620 So if you think about it,
1585720 1589220 Portland's kind of like a haven for<br />legendary punk drummers, right?
1589320 1590420 That's a good point.
1590520 1592900 Mia, your man knows<br />his punk rock history.
1593000 1594626 Thanks.
1595960 1598580 Oh, my God! Oh, God,<br />something just stung me.
1598680 1600260 Who does that?
1600360 1601380 A bee?
1601480 1603260 - Babe, are you sure it's a bee?<br />- Oh, yeah.
1603360 1604420 We got to get the stinger out.
1604520 1605580 No, we're not doing that.
1605680 1608387 Trust me, this is this only<br />thing I learned in Boy Scouts.
1617120 1618460 Got it.
1621880 1623580 Way hotter than tweezers.
1623680 1626260 Stand down, woman.<br />You're already knocked up.
1626360 1629060 You know, you should<br />get stung more often.
1629160 1630900 I'm sorry to say that's<br />the furthest we've gotten
1631000 1633229 since our first date.
1633880 1637702 Yeah. Maybe we should<br />do something about that.
1638240 1641027 I like where your head's at, Hall.
1670880 1671980 Adam?
1672080 1673460 I'm coming up.
1673560 1675140 No, you cannot come up.
1675240 1676900 I have something to tell you.
1677000 1679582 Besides, it's too late.<br />I'm already climbing.
1680600 1682590 Oh, God.
1688760 1690340 Okay.
1692800 1694500 Oh! Schroeder.
1704040 1705621 Hey.
1706960 1708461 Hey.
1709040 1710860 I thought you went home.
1710960 1712791 I got lost.
1716120 1719460 Did you actually learn that<br />beesting thing from the Boy Scouts?
1719560 1720860 No, I totally made it up.
1720960 1722620 I just really wanted<br />to suck your hand
1722720 1724660 in front of all your<br />parents' friends.
1729240 1731469 What did you want to tell me?
1732080 1733991 Today was awesome.
1734480 1737300 You guys are like a real family here.
1737400 1738900 I don't think I've ever seen<br />one of those up close.
1739000 1740740 It's impressive.
1740840 1743740 Yeah, well, trust me,<br />it hasn't always been that way.
1743840 1747060 When I was a kid,<br />things were so chaotic.
1747160 1750700 They'd be up late, so I was up late.
1750800 1754110 And Dad would be on the<br />road for weeks at a time.
1754520 1757830 They didn't really get it<br />together until Teddy was born.
1758520 1761671 What about you?<br />What are your parents like?
1763000 1765707 They're not really a part of my life.
1765840 1770180 Honestly, I can't remember them ever<br />being in the same place for a meal.
1770280 1772940 And if you want to track down the<br />old man, that's gonna take a while.
1773040 1774020 So...
1774120 1775260 Adam.
1775360 1779387 No, it's cool. I'm good<br />at being mostly alone.
1780680 1782784 But that's the thing,
1784000 1786389 you're not alone.
1787040 1789065 Not anymore.
1799320 1800901 Wait.
1801200 1803100 I need to take it slow, okay?
1803200 1805145 I love slow.
1811000 1816980 And meet
1817080 1819180 Me there
1819280 1825071 Bundles of flowers,<br />we wait through the hours of cold
1828480 1831780 Winter shall howl at the walls
1831880 1836749 Tearing down doors of time
1839280 1846265 Shelter as we go...
1848040 1849020 Is there enough room?
1849120 1850660 A little more underneath, please.
1850760 1853388 - Suture.<br />- There we go.
1856440 1858100 The surgery's been<br />going on for hours,
1858200 1860350 and they're nowhere near done.
1865960 1867700 I need to find my family.
1873520 1874620 Kim?
1874720 1876060 Kim, wait!
1880640 1882460 I came here as soon as<br />I could. What happened?
1882560 1884020 - Is everyone okay?<br />- We don't know.
1884120 1885460 Gran. Gramps.
1885560 1888301 We need to find out what<br />the hell's going on here.
1890640 1893220 Excuse me, my name is Estelle Hall.
1893320 1895700 Our son, Denny Hall,<br />his wife, Kathleen,
1895800 1897460 and their two kids got<br />in a car accident
1897560 1899980 this morning and we'd like to<br />find out how they're doing.
1900080 1901820 - Yes, of course.<br />- Mr. and Mrs. Hall?
1901920 1903100 I'm Liddy. I'm your social worker.
1903200 1905060 I've just been assigned your case.
1905160 1907220 I am so sorry for what's happened.
1907320 1910060 Now, I haven't been able to<br />speak to anyone's doctors yet,
1910160 1913660 but I do know that Mia and<br />Dennis are still in surgery.
1913760 1915980 Most likely they'll be<br />heading to the ICU.
1916080 1919060 There is no information on<br />Kathleen in the system yet.
1919160 1920540 But Theodore...
1920640 1922500 - Teddy?<br />- Yes, Teddy.
1922600 1924140 He was conscious when he arrived.
1924240 1925900 He's getting a CAT scan now.
1926000 1928420 Why don't you make yourselves<br />as comfortable as you can
1928520 1929620 and I will come and<br />get you the second
1929720 1931660 I have any new information. Okay?
1931760 1933147 Thank you.
1933520 1935220 Hey, Henry and Willow<br />are on their way.
1935320 1937260 And I tried calling Adam and<br />left a couple messages,
1937360 1939100 but I haven't heard anything yet.
1939200 1941180 There are two types of<br />people in this world, Kim.
1941280 1942860 Those who like real coffee,
1942960 1945780 and those who like froufrou<br />drinks with ridiculous names.
1945880 1947420 Wow. You know, I'm not ashamed to be
1947520 1948700 a cinnamon-spice chai latte lover.
1948800 1949780 Thank you very much.
1949880 1952620 Yeah, well, it kind of smells like<br />Christmas threw up in your mug.
1952720 1954260 Fine by me.
1954360 1956340 So, Adam.
1956440 1957740 Is it awesome?
1957840 1959540 It feels big.
1959640 1962940 It's crazy. I can't eat,<br />I can't sleep.
1963040 1964220 But...
1964320 1966940 For starters, I hate<br />going to his shows.
1967040 1968300 Do you not like his music, or...
1968400 1969580 No, I love his music.
1969680 1972460 He writes these amazing songs, and...
1972560 1974020 I don't know, when he comes off stage
1974120 1977700 I just wanna, like,<br />lick the side of his face.
1977800 1979620 Oh, baby.
1979720 1981460 But when I hang out with his crowd,
1981560 1982780 I just feel like...
1982880 1984380 Like a fish out of water?
1984480 1985820 Like a fish on Mars.
1985920 1989140 Come on, it's not his friends<br />you're afraid of, it's him.
1989240 1992140 I mean, he's older, he's in a band.
1992240 1995061 All those girls surrounding him.<br />I mean,
1995240 1997300 it's scary. I get it.
1997400 1999220 What if it doesn't work out?
1999320 2001460 You gonna be there to<br />pick up the pieces?
2001560 2003425 Every last one of 'em.
2004240 2005660 But if it gets serious,
2005760 2007060 you better not turn into<br />one of those girlfriends
2007160 2009185 who only speaks in<br />the first person plural.
2009760 2011500 "We love the winter."
2011600 2013590 "We never use deodorant."
2013720 2015500 "We only like quinoa."
2015600 2018740 If you ever turn into one of<br />those girls, I'mma gonna shoot ya.
2018840 2020260 If I ever turn into<br />one of those girls,
2020360 2022430 I'mma gonna give you the gun.
2027240 2028260 Hey. Mom?
2028360 2030980 Who's the toughest,<br />hottest rocker chick you can think of?
2031080 2032500 - Debbie Harry.<br />- Okay, cool.
2032600 2034500 Or Patti Smith or Joan Jett.
2034600 2036340 Lucinda Williams,<br />even though she's country.
2036440 2037660 Kim Gordon.
2037760 2039660 What's this,<br />a social studies project?
2039760 2043548 No, it's for Halloween.
2043800 2045620 Tonight, with Adam.
2045720 2048063 Oh, you're going as the rocker chick.
2048240 2049980 I don't even wanna go.
2050640 2052380 Bunny rabbit.
2052640 2053780 What's up?
2053880 2055580 I wanna dive into Adam's world.
2055680 2057140 You know, I wanna<br />be like his friends.
2057240 2059220 But what if I can't pull it off?
2059320 2061980 The whole messy punk rocker<br />live-in-the-moment thing.
2062080 2063820 Then you return all the clothes<br />to my closet in the morning
2063920 2065660 and go about your life.
2065760 2066900 Baby, it's one night.
2067000 2068500 Right?
2068600 2070900 I mean, I know it's not your thing,
2071000 2073821 but why not try out messy and<br />in-the-moment and see how it feels.
2074440 2076829 You might be surprised.
2085320 2087151 Hey, Adam.
2089320 2092860 Whoa, Hall. I didn't<br />think you had it in you.
2092960 2094220 Whoa, yourself.
2094320 2096106 I'm Beethoven.
2096600 2097860 Ludwig.
2097960 2100189 Come on, let's go.
2100520 2102385 What's up, Adam?
2103240 2104780 Debbie Harry always said,
2104880 2108140 "A shot before showtime<br />does the trick." So...
2108240 2109300 Bottoms up.
2109400 2111060 Oh, I'm good.
2111160 2113185 Okay. Well,<br />it's there if you want it.
2113640 2115740 Yo, Adam. We're goin' on.
2115840 2117540 Okay. I've gotta go do my set.
2117640 2119820 No running off with some me wannabe.
2119920 2121626 I'll try.
2123000 2124300 Have fun.
2124400 2126500 Oh, my God, Mia.
2126600 2129380 You look amazing.<br />Did you get this in Seattle?
2129480 2131380 Hey. Wanna bone?
2131480 2132700 You're frickin'<br />embarrassing yourself.
2132800 2134740 Come on, at least give<br />me your bone number.
2134840 2138662 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Willamette Stone!
2142880 2144380 Happy Halloween.
2144480 2146186 Whoo!
2146760 2148580 Are you coming?
2161760 2166380 I've gotta say I'm feelin'<br />better than I should
2166480 2171065 Don't got a lot, but I<br />know life is always good
2171200 2172260 Oh, come on over
2172360 2175460 Bring some friends<br />who have the time...
2175560 2176820 Mia, you have to come.
2176920 2178020 Wait.
2178120 2181021 I'm feeling fine...
2182320 2183620 Hey.
2183720 2185500 'Scuse me. Move it.
2185600 2190180 So tell me now,<br />are you in or are you not?
2190280 2194900 I don't want to move the world<br />I just wanna sit on top
2195000 2196060 Let's raise a glass
2196160 2199620 Here's to the best and to the worst
2199720 2204942 Here's to the feelings that<br />you just can't put to words
2214240 2219100 We got tonight we got tonight
2219200 2221420 For the years
2221520 2223620 For the night
2223720 2226060 I'm feelin' good
2226160 2228460 I'm feeling high
2228560 2232951 I'm feelin' like I've never felt
2233320 2238220 We got tonight we got tonight
2238320 2242267 For the years, for tonight...
2243720 2245460 Bye, Adam. Bye, Rocker Mia.
2245560 2246700 Bye, you guys.
2246800 2248347 Bye.
2251040 2252541 So...
2253320 2255420 Do you like me like this?
2255520 2257340 At last, you finally figured it out.
2257440 2259380 No, come on.
2259480 2262660 I mean, do you like<br />me how I am tonight?
2262760 2264060 You know what I liked?
2264160 2265780 I liked how into the show you were.
2265880 2267180 How you actually wanted to dance
2267280 2269620 and hang outwith us<br />riffraff afterwards.
2269720 2271140 That was cool.
2271240 2274346 Yeah, but do you like me better,
2274520 2276351 you know,
2276760 2278940 - like this?<br />- Better than what?
2279040 2280660 Better than the normal Mia.
2280760 2284780 You know, with the hair and<br />the makeup and the clothing.
2285960 2289430 Mia, I don't give a shit<br />about your clothes.
2289840 2291340 Don't you get it?
2291440 2294980 The you you are now is the same<br />you I was in love with yesterday.
2295080 2297787 The same you I'll be<br />in love with tomorrow.
2313480 2315709 Can we go somewhere?
2317000 2318661 Yeah.
2331000 2332706 Wow.
2334240 2335420 What is this place?
2335520 2338785 It's an old boatworks shed.
2340320 2343060 One day, me and the band<br />are gonna fix it up
2343160 2345867 and we're gonna rehearse<br />and record here.
2347880 2349460 It's perfect.
2351360 2353225 So are you.
2366600 2368060 Adam.
2368160 2369707 Yeah?
2370840 2372671 I've never...
2373240 2375540 Just think of it like we're<br />playing music together.
2375640 2376780 Adam, that doesn't make any sense.
2376880 2379064 Yes, it does.
2380560 2382780 All right, well,<br />take your jacket off.
2382880 2384541 Okay.
2391120 2392781 All right.
2393280 2396670 So we have four strings.
2396800 2399220 We have the C string
2399320 2401020 and G,
2401120 2402826 D
2403080 2404627 and A.
2404800 2408380 And if I were to play glissando,
2408480 2410823 it'd feel like this.
2412160 2415620 And if I were to play pizzicato,
2415720 2417551 it'd feel like this.
2418400 2420020 And if I were to play forte.
2420120 2422060 I know forte.
2422160 2424822 I ain't never gonna shut you out!
2425120 2428191 Everywhere I'm looking now
2428440 2432387 I'm surrounded by your embrace
2432600 2435865 Baby, I can see your halo
2436200 2440341 You know you're my saving grace...
2447760 2449780 Intensive Care Unit.
2449880 2451586 Yeah, she is.
2455280 2457782 How are we, beautiful?
2458040 2461060 I told 'em that I don't<br />wanna leave you.
2461160 2463503 I'm not gonna let you<br />out of my sight.
2467280 2470226 We have another one from<br />the accident, Nurse Davis.
2472000 2474741 Dad. Thank God.
2476160 2477700 Oh, my God, George.
2477800 2479100 Is he going to be okay?
2479200 2480620 We're updating his chart right now.
2480720 2482100 The doctor will be in to<br />speak with you shortly.
2482200 2483701 Dad?
2484280 2486460 Where is he?<br />Where'd you guys take him?
2486560 2488860 I'll just finish writing the<br />orders and then she's all yours.
2488960 2490420 Girl's been through the wringer.
2490520 2493300 Yeah. And this is the easy part.<br />Accident like that?
2493400 2495460 Mom was DOA. Dad died on the table.
2495560 2496820 Poor kid's waking up an orphan.
2496920 2498501 If she wakes up.
2501200 2502700 Mom.
2502800 2504060 Dad!
2518720 2521302 I'm getting you!
2526560 2528186 Whoo!
2530920 2532420 I love you.
2544320 2545867 Teddy.
2563320 2565310 1814...
2574920 2576421 Teddy.
2579960 2582300 Hey, little man. Look at this room.
2582400 2584060 You got the best place in the joint.
2584160 2586020 Are you okay?
2586120 2589580 That's right. You just get some rest.
2589680 2591860 I'm not going anywhere.
2591960 2594940 Oh, Gran. Hey, I just got here.
2595040 2597140 They're saying he's<br />through the worst of it.
2597240 2598900 They were assigning his room,<br />so, I thought I'd come here
2599000 2601460 before I checked in on Kat and Den...
2601560 2603425 They didn't...
2604320 2606151 Oh, my God!
2607320 2609060 Excuse me.
2617240 2619900 You're mine now, Teddy.
2620000 2624027 And no matter what,<br />I will never leave you.
2625040 2627110 We're gonna make it.
2632040 2634429 Listen, I need to do something.
2636080 2638389 But I promise you, Teddy.
2652040 2653580 Adam.
2653680 2655705 You came.
2669200 2672260 Listen. You can't let Teddy<br />grow up without a family.
2672360 2674020 You have got to fight.
2674120 2676860 You can do this. You have to do this.
2676960 2678020 Mia!
2678120 2679580 - Excuse me.<br />- Sir!
2679680 2681340 - Mia!<br />- Adam.
2681440 2682460 Mia!
2682560 2684061 Mia!
2692400 2695824 Being with Adam was<br />like learning to fly.
2696920 2701311 It was exciting and scary,<br />all at the same time.
2703280 2707227 That spring was a magical time.
2708120 2710140 Adam's band was playing bigger clubs
2710240 2712380 and festival in different cities.
2712480 2716420 Once he graduated, they started<br />getting booked even more.
2716520 2719671 By the fall, record labels<br />were taking notice.
2720640 2723620 People were taking notice of me too.
2723720 2726460 I was the first high school<br />student ever invited
2726560 2730064 to perform solo at the<br />college's fall recital.
2733080 2735460 And even though Adam was away a lot,
2735560 2738900 when he was in town,<br />we spent all of our time together.
2739000 2741540 I can't believe I'm stuck<br />at school for another year.
2741640 2743540 It'll go by fast.
2743640 2746100 You still thinking of<br />applying to Lewis & Clark?
2746200 2749580 Yeah, of course. I mean,<br />they have a great music program.
2749680 2751860 I need someplace with financial aid.
2751960 2755060 Maybe we can live around<br />the corner from each other.
2755160 2759551 Or we could shorten the commute<br />and get a place together.
2759960 2761586 Really?
2763440 2766386 That actually sounds kinda perfect.
2786120 2788065 - Kid's good.<br />- Whoo!
2791840 2793140 Sir, I told you you<br />can't go in there.
2793240 2795140 What do you mean I can't go<br />in there? This is bullshit.
2795240 2796700 Sir, you can't be in there.
2796800 2798420 You need to calm down.
2798520 2799700 ICU visitations are restricted
2799800 2802700 to immediate family only.<br />Are you family?
2802800 2804660 All right, you got me.<br />I'm not family.
2804760 2806180 Come on, just let him in!
2806280 2808066 Do I need to call security?
2808320 2809901 Adam.
2819400 2820820 Juilliard?
2820920 2822940 Just look on the computer like you do
2823040 2825100 and see what it takes<br />to get in there.
2825200 2827180 They say it's the best there is.
2827280 2830100 Of course it is,<br />but it's across the country.
2830200 2834421 You know, and Lewis & Clark has an<br />amazing performance studies program.
2834680 2838389 Besides, my whole life is here.
2853720 2855060 Dad, can I ask you a question?
2855160 2856420 Always.
2856520 2858545 Do you ever miss being in your band?
2859400 2861180 What brought this on?
2861280 2865340 You always say that you left your<br />band to become a better dad.
2865440 2868100 But you were a great dad<br />when you were in the band.
2868200 2871060 You didn't have to give up something<br />you loved so much just for us.
2871160 2874180 No, baby, I didn't give anything up.
2874280 2875540 I played that adventure out,
2875640 2878140 and then it was time for a<br />new adventure with you guys.
2878240 2880180 And sometimes you<br />make choices in life,
2880280 2884068 and sometimes choices make you.
2884720 2886540 Does that make any sense?
2886640 2888820 Yeah. I mean,
2888920 2891340 I think that the cello was<br />a choice that made me.
2891440 2893226 There you go.
2908960 2912140 Do you think the band<br />would ever relocate?
2912240 2913340 No. Why?
2913440 2914660 I don't know.
2914760 2916940 To see someplace new.
2917040 2918666 Maybe New York.
2919280 2921703 I can't imagine. Portland's<br />where we're from, you know?
2924120 2925667 Oh, yeah.
2931360 2932940 I gotta tell you something.
2933040 2935702 I have to listen to what<br />you have to tell me.
2938200 2942068 I'm going to buy all of these albums.
2942640 2944980 Whoa. The whole three bucks?
2945080 2947309 Slow down, big spender.
2967000 2968100 Whoo!
2968200 2971860 Whoa, Mom. Seriously,<br />that just makes me more nervous.
2971960 2973620 Sorry. Just ignore me.
2973720 2975300 Yeah. Just pretend we're not here.
2975400 2977500 Dad, honestly, how was that one?
2977600 2979100 I thought it was fantastic, Mia.
2979200 2980460 You say that about everything.
2980560 2982940 Because you're awesome.<br />They have to give you an audition.
2983040 2984580 Yeah, but you don't understand.
2984680 2986140 This is Juilliard.
2986240 2987620 This isn't just some punk album
2987720 2990580 where you can throw music at a<br />wall and hope it sounds all right.
2990680 2992181 Whoa.
2994240 2995500 I'm sorry.
2995600 2997340 I really didn't mean that.
2997760 2999860 This is pointless.
2999960 3002110 I'm not good enough.
3005160 3007742 I thought the last one was amazing.
3010160 3011661 Really?
3013280 3015340 I think I can do better.
3015440 3017385 Then let's do it.
3018960 3020100 Okay.
3020200 3021660 Yeah. Let's do it.
3035120 3037340 I miss you every time you go.
3037440 3040580 It'll just be a few days. Maybe more.
3040680 3044540 Well, I know you guys are<br />gonna kill it at City Limits.
3044640 3045660 Are you sure you can't come?
3045760 3047660 I'm pretty sure I can fit<br />you in my guitar case.
3049160 3052231 I would, but I got school.
3052600 3053580 Wow.
3053680 3055060 Never thought I'd hear that again.
3055160 3057020 - Come on, we gotta hit the road.<br />- Okay.
3063360 3065540 - I'll be back before you know it.<br />- Okay.
3065640 3068060 - Come on. We gotta go.<br />- We're bringing him back, all right?
3068160 3070220 - Bye.<br />- Have fun.
3070320 3071946 We roll.
3080120 3083100 So what's the whatty-what<br />from Austin? Hear from Adam?
3083200 3085300 No. I called him,<br />but I haven't heard back.
3086680 3088580 It's fine. I mean, he's slammed.
3088680 3091060 Yeah, life on the road.
3091160 3093344 Don't give me that face.
3094840 3096705 Speaking of the devil.
3096840 3097900 Hello?
3098000 3098940 Hey, babe.
3099040 3100260 So, you all rich and famous now?
3100360 3101460 Not yet.
3101560 3103340 But Merge Records made<br />an offer to sign us.
3103440 3104780 It's been crazy.
3104880 3107260 Shut up. That's amazing, Adam.
3107360 3109340 Yeah, they're throwing<br />us a party right now.
3109440 3111100 Well, I miss you.
3111200 3114586 Dude! You got champagne<br />all over my phone!
3115920 3117581 Hello?
3172120 3174668 Waiting for the rejection
3175040 3178060 It comes in waves and<br />it feels like a throb
3178160 3180981 You wanted only the ending
3181160 3184311 But what you got was much too long
3184440 3187260 I can't be you, you know
3187360 3190340 My heart is underground
3190440 3193220 When I believe it was different
3193320 3195660 I believe we could turn it...
3195760 3197421 Wait.
3199680 3201227 Sorry.
3202000 3203786 Mia, wait.
3205400 3206380 Sorry, I didn't see ya there.
3206480 3208420 No worries. Just bringing<br />food for you guys.
3208520 3210060 Oh, cool. Thanks.
3210160 3211700 We're just gettin' ready<br />for tomorrow night.
3211800 3213300 It's gonna be a total homecoming.
3213400 3216300 It's our first gig in town<br />since we got signed.
3216400 3217901 Adam.
3218240 3219821 Yeah?
3220680 3222830 I applied to Juilliard.
3224080 3225740 - What?<br />- Yeah,
3225840 3227420 it's this amazing school.
3227520 3229863 Yeah, I know what Juilliard is.
3231160 3232260 Well, it was just on a whim.
3232360 3234140 Isn't it in New York?
3234240 3235420 Yeah.
3235520 3237340 Well, why didn't you tell me?
3237440 3238380 Well, I tried
3238480 3241860 but I figured, why tell<br />you until it was real?
3241960 3244060 Okay. So why you telling me now?
3244160 3245740 Well, I got an audition.
3245840 3248308 In San Francisco.
3249040 3250541 Wow.
3251000 3252220 Wow.
3252320 3254629 Juilliard. Mia, that's...
3255000 3257184 Way to go. That's cool.
3257640 3259860 Yeah, well, I won't get in.
3259960 3261580 But it's kind of a big deal
3261680 3263511 that I even got an audition.
3263640 3266108 Most people don't.
3267520 3270830 Well, Yo Mama better<br />watch his back. Right?
3286200 3292260 I can't get you out of my mind
3292360 3297780 I can't get you out of my mind
3299560 3301380 The homecoming concert was different
3301480 3303780 than any show the band had played.
3303880 3308226 They were tighter, better,<br />more confident than ever before.
3311400 3312620 And Adam seemed,
3312720 3315905 well, like he was becoming<br />a full-blown star.
3329240 3335500 I can't get you out of my mind
3342480 3344660 They're really good.<br />I've been following them.
3344760 3346500 Thanks. Thanks for coming.
3346600 3348020 Did you like the show?
3348120 3349860 Good.
3351600 3353060 - Thanks, guys.<br />- Aw!
3353160 3354140 Hey.
3354240 3356780 You guys were insanely good up there.
3356880 3358620 Yeah, well, I'm glad<br />you could make it.
3358720 3360540 Of course I made it.
3360640 3362020 - A-bomb.<br />- Hey, man!
3362120 3363500 - I can't believe you came!<br />- What's goin' on, bro?
3363600 3365660 - Tight set tonight.<br />- Could I get your autograph?
3365760 3367300 Yeah, sure.
3367400 3369265 Oh, wow. Okay.
3369600 3370620 It says Willamette Stone.
3370720 3372900 Yeah. I can see that.
3373000 3375184 There you go. This is cool.
3384480 3385740 If you're so bored you have to read,
3385840 3388820 maybe you should've just stayed home.
3388920 3392020 I'm just trying to get<br />some homework done.
3392120 3393580 And researching what phrase
3393680 3396626 I'm gonna have tattooed<br />over my left boob.
3398840 3399940 What's all this?
3400040 3401060 We got booked last-minute to do
3401160 3402500 a string of shows in Seattle.
3402600 3405023 We gotta leave tonight, so...
3406200 3407260 For how long?
3407360 3408380 I don't know. Like a week?
3408480 3409700 Ten days?
3409800 3411340 It's hard to say.
3411440 3413500 Yeah, but we had plans.
3413600 3415260 Remember?<br />For my birthday dinner?
3415360 3417703 Oh, right.<br />Shit. Sorry.
3417880 3420420 Well, it's fine. I just<br />wish you would've told me.
3420520 3422510 What, like you told<br />me about Juilliard?
3423680 3425220 And for the record, I didn't<br />even hear about the tour
3425320 3427580 until tonight right<br />before the show, so...
3427680 3429420 So that's what "Glad you could<br />make it" was all about?
3429520 3430860 That's why you're so pissed at me?
3430960 3432060 Why would I be pissed about<br />you going to a school
3432160 3433260 3,000 miles away?
3433360 3436900 I'm not going there, Adam.<br />It's just an audition.
3437000 3439420 Which you didn't even<br />tell me about, Mia!
3439520 3441260 And besides, this isn't<br />about Juilliard.
3441360 3443020 This is about you<br />ditching on our plans.
3443120 3444746 - You're a liar.<br />- Whoa!
3445200 3448420 Screw you, Adam! I haven't<br />ditched out on anything.
3448520 3450100 Am I crazy, or did you say that
3450200 3453021 us getting a place together<br />would be perfect? Huh?
3453200 3455140 - It's...<br />- No, you know what?
3455240 3456980 It's fine.
3457560 3458740 Whatever.
3458840 3459940 What? You get to follow your dreams,
3460040 3462500 but I can't follow mine unless<br />I have your permission?
3462600 3464020 And I just have to sit<br />here and wait around,
3464120 3466460 hoping that you'll come<br />home every few weeks?
3466560 3467540 How is that fair?
3467640 3469860 You lied to me, Mia. We had plans.
3469960 3471780 One minute, it's one thing.<br />The next minute, it's the other.
3471880 3473020 I grew up with that shit, okay?
3473120 3475349 I don't need it.
3476040 3477500 Even if I do go to Juilliard,
3477600 3479900 we can figure it out.
3480000 3482140 Baby, we can text and we can Skype...
3482240 3483580 Skype? Skype?
3483680 3484900 Jesus, Mia! Have you ever even
3485000 3486500 had a long-distance relationship?
3486600 3488060 It's bullshit.
3488160 3490980 Okay? It's like dating a ghost.
3491080 3492980 But Skype, it solves<br />everything right?
3493080 3494180 You know, you're so naive, man.
3494280 3495700 You don't know shit about the world.
3495800 3497380 I can't believe you<br />just said that to me.
3497480 3498900 What, you want me to<br />write it down for you?
3499000 3501780 Adam! Sorry, dude, but we gotta jet
3501880 3504462 if we wanna make it to<br />the motel before sunup.
3505880 3507660 No! No. You cannot<br />leave me like that!
3507760 3509340 Why didn't you tell me?
3509440 3512750 Maybe because I am<br />terrified of losing you!
3516560 3519666 You know what? You do your thing.<br />I'm gonna do mine.
3521720 3524660 Fine, but for the record,<br />you're the one who's getting in the van.
3524760 3526220 Yeah, whatever.
3560520 3561740 Mr. and Mrs. Hall?
3561840 3563341 Yes.
3564640 3566700 So, Mia's still unconscious.
3566800 3569140 The respiratory therapists<br />are going to run some tests
3569240 3572260 to see when they can wean<br />her off the ventilator.
3572360 3574100 So, that's good news.
3574200 3576260 If she can breathe on her own.
3576360 3579700 With comatose patients,<br />the first 24 hours are critical.
3579800 3581460 If she shows any<br />signs of awareness...
3581560 3583420 - Adam.<br />- I'm sorry. I gotta go.
3591280 3595501 Woke up this morning...
3608240 3613300 Looked up this morning
3613400 3619191 Saw the roses full of thorns...
3625880 3629060 The food was good but the<br />service is a little, you know...
3629160 3631380 Well, I'm sorry.<br />It's just the way things are.
3631480 3633903 That's not necessary.
3634040 3635780 When are we gonna open presents?
3635880 3637300 - Mia?<br />- That's gonna be fun!
3637400 3638460 Yeah, you wanna do that?
3638560 3640391 Yeah, sure.
3642520 3646547 I've gone all around
3647360 3653230 Till there's nothing left to say
3659000 3663789 Wrote it all down
3664160 3670508 Into something that couldn't be said
3684280 3687140 I thought you were supposed to be,
3687240 3689020 in Seattle.
3689120 3691180 No show tonight so I just
3691280 3693305 thought I'd drive down for the day.
3702320 3704020 What's that?
3704120 3705220 It's a replica.
3705320 3707780 Of Jolari Hall in San Francisco.
3707880 3709980 Where you'll be<br />auditioning for Juilliard.
3710080 3711900 That's the ceiling.
3712000 3713980 I put it up there.
3714080 3715580 It's intense.
3715680 3717700 Yeah. I figured,
3717800 3719020 you know, if you<br />look at it every night
3719120 3721941 it wouldn't seem so scary<br />when you get there.
3724800 3727109 What do you want, Adam?
3728320 3729420 Mia, I'm sorry.
3729520 3732220 - I know, I suck.<br />- No, no.
3732320 3734660 You can't just disappear<br />from my life like that
3734760 3736580 and pop back into it<br />whenever you feel like it.
3736680 3738540 I know. It's just,
3738640 3741940 the people in my life have a<br />habit of disappearing on me
3742040 3743540 and when you started making plans...
3743640 3746142 You're not gonna lose me.
3747880 3750223 Adam, I love you.
3751680 3754023 But these last few days
3754360 3756220 have been brutal.
3756320 3757860 I know.
3757960 3759985 I know. For me too.
3768160 3769991 Happy birthday.
3772080 3773580 Well, at least I know<br />the wrapping's yours.
3773680 3775545 Shut up. And just open it. Come on.
3782000 3784707 It's a cello and a guitar.
3784880 3786905 Do you get it?
3808360 3811181 God, I hate you.
3826920 3829620 When did you know you were good?
3829720 3830700 Oh, I dunno.
3830800 3831820 Liar.
3831920 3833060 No! I mean, the guitar! Come on.
3833160 3835628 What was, like, the moment?
3836920 3839263 Actually, there was one night.
3839840 3842468 When we first started playing out.
3843600 3846260 Right before the show, Liz talked<br />me into going to the liquor store
3846360 3848828 and getting her a Red Bull.
3850680 3852830 So I go in
3853440 3856864 and there's this drunk dude<br />buying a bottle of Jack.
3859040 3861463 And I realize it's him.
3862520 3864749 It's my old man.
3866120 3867700 And I just
3867800 3869825 stop cold.
3871840 3874380 And he just looks right at me
3874480 3876505 and walks out.
3877040 3879304 No idea who I was.
3881640 3883505 Shit, Adam.
3884120 3887700 Then that night,<br />I played like I was on fire.
3887800 3890620 I don't know if I thought I was good.
3890720 3893826 I just knew that<br />nothing else mattered.
3894720 3896420 Till now.
3896520 3898431 Till you.
3909560 3911585 When I play,
3913200 3914660 I kind of picture
3914760 3917388 myself inside the cello.
3919200 3920420 It's like my little house.
3920520 3922181 Really?
3925680 3926900 Actually, no.
3927000 3928900 I'm totally just in it for the guys.
3929000 3930501 Oh.
3932720 3934740 - I got you, didn't I?<br />- Yeah.
3934840 3936341 Yeah.
3960440 3963864 How am I supposed to find<br />the strength to stay?
3964720 3967905 What would it feel like<br />to wake up an orphan?
3968600 3971780 To never smell Dad cooking pancakes?
3971880 3976226 To never stand next to Mom quietly<br />talking as we do the dishes?
3977680 3979909 But how could I go?
3982600 3985180 The nurse said I control<br />this whole thing.
3985280 3987980 If I live, if I die.
3988080 3990070 It's all up to me.
3991080 3994345 And that terrifies me<br />more than anything else.
3999240 4000980 Mia Hall.
4001280 4003111 Good luck.
4147280 4149700 Thanks for driving me, Gramps.
4149800 4151825 I mean, that was...
4154400 4155901 Thank you.
4156200 4157781 Mia.
4159520 4162260 I just wanted to tell you that
4162360 4164100 I watched your audition.
4164200 4166145 From backstage.
4166360 4167380 I wasn't too sure
4167480 4169660 if that cello was gonna<br />make it out alive.
4169760 4171620 I know. I didn't know I had it in me.
4171720 4173267 Well, you do.
4173400 4174460 You were fearless.
4174560 4177188 You played your guts out up there.
4177400 4178901 Mia.
4179800 4182380 You've got something special.
4182480 4184340 Your dad had it too,
4184440 4186500 but I never told him.
4186600 4189785 I never made too much<br />fuss about his music
4190440 4192660 and I don't wanna make the<br />same mistake with you.
4192760 4194380 If those Juilliard<br />people don't take you,
4194480 4195860 they are damn fools
4195960 4198701 because what you did<br />up there was magic.
4201520 4203545 Thank you, Gramps.
4218560 4221825 I spend these hollow nights
4222120 4225146 All alone
4228840 4232150 Safe from the looking glass
4232320 4235824 Which you kept home
4239240 4241980 I saw the sea and knew
4242080 4246426 It was a mirage
4249480 4252460 It wasn't even so
4252560 4256348 I played the odds
4258160 4260700 I never wanted to go
4260800 4263302 And now I'm letting you know
4263480 4265340 I just wanted to feel
4265440 4270740 The life in me
4275200 4277020 Oh, hey! You're back.
4277120 4279580 That was a really<br />beautiful song, Adam.
4279680 4281705 It's gettin' there.
4282520 4283540 How'd it go?
4283640 4285300 Did you kill the audition?
4285400 4288100 Are they gonna let you in<br />on a full scholarship?
4288200 4290460 I did all right, I guess.
4290560 4292140 But it's kinda like
4292240 4293620 playing to statues.
4293720 4296020 Oh, come on. I bet you<br />did better than you think.
4296120 4297985 And if not...
4299800 4301660 Actually...
4301760 4306106 Adam, I played better than<br />I have in my entire life.
4307040 4311260 It was like I was possessed<br />and the music, it just...
4311360 4314022 it poured out of me.
4314440 4318387 God. I've never felt<br />anything like that before.
4319480 4320981 Wow.
4321760 4324103 I wish I could've seen that.
4324840 4326830 Yeah, me too.
4328320 4331505 You know, for once, I actually felt
4331760 4334069 like I could do this.
4335760 4339540 Why didn't you call me<br />after the audition to brag?
4339640 4342825 I know I should have, but...
4344200 4345180 I don't wanna fight, okay?
4345280 4347111 I know. I don't wanna fight.
4350440 4352900 Okay, well, you played better<br />than you have in your entire life.
4353000 4354990 We should celebrate.
4364440 4367340 So how come you've never<br />written a song for me?
4367440 4369020 I don't know, I'm no good at writing
4369120 4370860 about things that make me happy.
4370960 4372300 If you want a song,<br />you're gonna have to, like,
4372400 4373500 cheat on me or something.
4373600 4375180 What do I have to do<br />for a whole album?
4375280 4377140 Come on. Don't get greedy.
4381520 4383180 You know, I don't<br />think I'll even get in.
4383280 4385020 There were like 100 other kids there.
4385120 4387860 Then I don't have to choose, right?
4387960 4391540 But if you do get in, the choice<br />is already made, isn't it?
4391640 4393860 Mia, come on. I'm not<br />gonna be that asshole
4393960 4396340 that stops you from<br />going to Juilliard.
4396440 4399100 If it was me, you'd let me go.
4399200 4402146 Yeah, but in a way, I already have.
4402360 4404540 You know, you're going<br />to your own Juilliard.
4404640 4406426 Yeah, I know.
4406960 4408985 But I'm still here.
4409880 4413145 Okay? And I'm still<br />crazy in love with you.
4414680 4416909 Yeah, me too.
4435840 4437740 There you are.
4437840 4440342 Been looking everywhere for you.
4442520 4445420 Guess your big show<br />got canceled, huh?
4445520 4447670 Like I give a shit.
4448480 4450580 - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just...<br />- No, it's fine.
4450680 4452420 I get it.
4457440 4459829 The first day, man.
4460880 4463660 The first day I walked past that room
4463760 4466228 and saw her playing, that was it.
4470560 4472100 God, I'm such an asshole.
4472200 4474543 No, Adam. Don't.
4479320 4482471 She get in? To Juilliard?
4483840 4485546 I don't know.
4485720 4488060 Letters sent out Friday.
4488160 4490867 I think she was<br />supposed to hear today.
4491840 4493260 I can't.
4493360 4495749 I can't lose her again.
4497920 4499581 Let's go.
4520440 4521941 What now?
4522600 4524943 Well, I gotta get in there.<br />I gotta see her.
4531600 4532660 Excuse me.
4532760 4535060 Hi, there's this girl<br />and she's having a baby
4535160 4537260 in the bathroom on the third floor.
4537360 4538860 And she's down there<br />and she's just grunting
4538960 4540700 and screaming and there's<br />blood everywhere!
4540800 4541980 And it's really unsanitary,
4542080 4543540 and we really need someone<br />down there right now.
4543640 4544660 Okay...
4544760 4547300 We really need someone<br />down there right now!
4547400 4549231 - Shit!<br />- Go!
4554880 4557460 Excuse me, young man,<br />I've told you you can't be here.
4557560 4558620 Security, get me Security. Right now.
4558720 4560631 Mia Hall?
4562040 4564460 Please, I just wanna<br />feel you touch me.
4564560 4566664 - Mia.<br />- Please.
4567320 4569460 - Hands off.<br />- Come on.
4569560 4571300 What are you doing? Get off me!
4571400 4573823 You can't do this to him!
4574080 4576340 You know, I tried to<br />do this the nice way.
4576440 4578460 You wouldn't know nice if<br />it bit you in the ass, lady.
4578560 4580585 Hey. Knock it off.
4580760 4582460 - Willow?<br />- Willow?
4582560 4583860 What the hell is going on?
4583960 4585220 They were trying to<br />break into the ICU.
4585320 4588100 Yeah, 'cause Jabba the Nurse<br />wouldn't let us in to see Mia.
4588200 4590620 Well, I know these kids personally,<br />so, why don't you just let me
4590720 4592745 handle it from here.
4593840 4597310 Fine. Then just keep<br />them in the waiting room.
4601200 4602900 What the hell were you guys thinking?
4603000 4605150 I need to see Mia.
4606960 4609861 Well, she's gonna need<br />you now more than ever.
4612080 4614070 Hey, what's going on?
4614640 4616949 Willow, what's happening?
4618200 4620190 Willow, why aren't you with Teddy?
4620760 4622307 Willow.
4623200 4625100 Oh, shit.
4625200 4626826 Teddy!
4632840 4634785 Mr. and Mrs. Hall.
4635280 4637703 - Teddy.<br />- I'm Dr. DeVenne.
4638200 4640300 - Teddy?<br />- I am so sorry.
4640400 4641620 Where is he?
4641720 4644140 He had an epidural<br />hemorrhage in the brain.
4644240 4646460 We did everything we<br />could to save him.
4646560 4648346 No!
4652240 4655700 He will never graduate<br />from T-ball to baseball.
4655800 4658143 And never learn to drive.
4658480 4659740 Never kiss a girl.
4659840 4661140 You can't catch me!
4661240 4663071 Never fall in love.
4668240 4670105 God!
4672320 4674868 I don't wanna... I don't wanna...
4676320 4677940 God, I don't wanna...
4678040 4679740 I don't wanna do this anymore.
4679840 4682069 I want this to be over!
4696040 4697060 Give me the chart.
4697160 4698340 Abdomen's rigid. Full of fluid.
4698440 4701420 Jesus. Splenectomy,<br />brain contusions, collapsed lung.
4701520 4704140 - We gotta run.<br />- BP and pulse ox are dropping.
4704240 4706420 Okay, let's get her back in surgery.<br />Let's go, come on.
4706520 4708660 Get out of the way.<br />Swipe the door, please.
4708760 4711308 - Get that elevator.<br />- Out of the way!
4712240 4714265 They know we're coming?
4715640 4718540 All right, sweetheart.<br />We can only carry you so far.
4718640 4720983 After that, it's all you.
4724320 4726106 Oh, my God. Mia.
4729440 4731430 - Oh, my God.<br />- Adam.
4732240 4734265 Goodbye, Adam.
4741920 4743420 It's almost time. It's almost time.
4743520 4745460 I'll take some of that. Yeah.
4745560 4747505 - Do not!<br />- Thank you!
4748160 4749991 Cheers.
4751400 4753020 Nine, eight, seven, six...
4753120 4755180 - There you are!<br />- Here I am!
4755280 4757180 ...five, four...
4757280 4759740 three, two, one.
4759840 4761900 Happy New Year!
4765160 4768740 "Even when they were<br />just wasting time
4768840 4770700 "they weren't wasting time.
4770800 4774463 "It was as if no time they spent<br />together could ever be wasted."
4774760 4775740 Who said that?
4775840 4777500 Some guy in some book.
4777600 4778900 And what was he talking about?
4779000 4780860 Some couple in some movie.
4780960 4781940 My point is...
4782040 4783180 Yes, maestro?
4783280 4787020 My point is he could have<br />been talking about us.
4787120 4789110 That he could.
4802280 4803420 Promise me.
4803520 4805300 I promise you.
4805400 4807311 Wait, what am I promising?
4808040 4810861 That we'll spend next<br />New Year's together.
4812200 4814780 Even if we're in different places,<br />you'll still be with me.
4814880 4816700 No, that's not good enough.<br />Not Skyping,
4816800 4819300 not texting, together.
4819400 4822904 Baby, you know we can't<br />promise each other that.
4824720 4827666 I guess we both know<br />where this is heading.
4840920 4842865 Yeah, I guess so.
4851840 4853660 The old thing...
4853760 4855180 - All right.<br />- Delicious!
4855280 4857020 What are you looking at?
4857120 4859420 Because we're fascinated.
4859520 4860580 - You!<br />- Fascinating.
4860680 4863260 You're a spatula man now.
4863360 4865300 - Look it, a drummer.<br />- He's totally drumming with it.
4865400 4867340 Come on, give me your plate.<br />All right, get ready.
4867440 4868900 Hey! There she is.
4869000 4870020 Hey!
4870120 4871660 Happy New Year!
4871760 4873140 If you're still drunk,<br />you're totally grounded.
4873240 4874980 If not, I'm gonna let it slide.
4875080 4876300 I'm definitely not drunk.
4876400 4878860 Well, you were still out all<br />night so come on. Spill.
4878960 4880180 How was the party?
4880280 4881540 Fine.
4881640 4883551 How was Adam?
4887960 4891140 Okay, everybody. Let's move<br />this party to another room.
4891240 4892500 Let's go.
4892600 4894540 Take your mimosas.
4894640 4896904 We'll go watch the Rose Parade.
4897480 4900142 Come on. Let's go.
4909320 4910860 I'm sorry.
4910960 4912380 Oh, God, it's gross.
4912480 4914470 It's not gross.
4915000 4916911 Oh, God.
4917280 4918380 You wash, I'll dry.
4918480 4919660 Yeah.
4919760 4921340 Make us feel better.
4921440 4923829 Warm water, soap.
4925920 4927180 Oh, God.
4927280 4929700 I'm such a mess.
4929800 4931940 You know, we had this
4932040 4934668 perfect year and a half together.
4936920 4941740 And now, we're just moving<br />in different directions.
4941840 4943705 Is it over?
4944360 4946021 Yeah.
4950040 4951780 You're supposed to<br />break up with someone
4951880 4953300 because you're not in love with them.
4953400 4955948 Not because you're completely<br />in love with them.
4959720 4961700 But what do I know, right?<br />I'm only 17.
4961800 4963900 You know plenty.
4964000 4966940 It's just very inconvenient to<br />fall in love when you're 17.
4967040 4968500 Especially if it's the real thing.
4968600 4971500 You know, if we weren't musicians,<br />we could just...
4971600 4974260 We could just go to college together.
4974360 4975980 You know, like normal people do.
4976080 4977660 There's no such thing as normal, Mia.
4977760 4978860 Every relationship is rough.
4978960 4979940 I don't have to tell you that.
4980040 4981060 Yeah, I know.
4981160 4982220 Don't blame it on music.
4982320 4984743 Yeah, but music's the<br />reason we're breaking up.
4985720 4988660 That is bullshit, Mia. You know that.
4988760 4991069 What am I gonna do?
4991760 4994786 I am being completely torn in half.
4996240 4997820 You're going to go to Juilliard
4997920 4999910 and play the hell out of your cello.
5000760 5003103 Or you're not.
5003680 5005140 You're gonna stay with Adam
5005240 5007420 and have lots of amazing adventures.
5007520 5009140 Or you're not.
5009240 5012180 Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's<br />gonna smash into a meteor.
5012280 5014145 Or it's not.
5014360 5017740 Life is this big fat<br />gigantic stinking mess.
5017840 5020468 But that's the beauty of it too.
5021600 5023860 Whatever you do, I support you.
5023960 5026110 Either way, you win.
5026600 5029546 And also either way there's<br />something that you lose.
5031440 5033783 What can I say, baby?
5034200 5036782 True love's a bitch.
5096040 5097701 Gramps.
5099520 5101704 Gramps, what do I do?
5108240 5110620 I've been trying to think
5110720 5115191 of what Denny would<br />want me to say to you.
5115520 5117704 The kid was a helluva<br />of dad, wasn't he?
5118440 5120942 He sure had me beat.
5121600 5126549 I remember the day<br />that he quit the band.
5127760 5130460 He just up and said,
5130560 5133791 "That's it. The time has come."
5135040 5137542 I was surprised.
5138720 5142429 I never really liked the<br />way the band sounded,
5143080 5145140 but I knew how important<br />it was to him.
5145240 5149142 And so I asked him, I said,<br />"Why are you quitting?"
5149560 5151820 And he said,
5151920 5155500 "You make sacrifices for your kids.
5155600 5157864 "For your kids."
5158720 5160500 He said that without even blinking.
5160600 5162660 That's why he quit the band.
5162760 5164220 For Teddy.
5164320 5166060 For you.
5166760 5169900 It was when he heard<br />you play so well.
5170000 5172901 I think that's when<br />it clicked for him.
5173640 5176700 Your incredible talent, it...
5176800 5180420 He just couldn't believe it.
5180520 5184660 And all he wanted to do<br />was to give you more.
5184760 5186820 So, he quit the band,
5186920 5189184 he sold his drum kit
5189800 5191950 and he bought you that cello.
5193440 5195465 Sacrifice.
5195840 5198991 That's what we do for the<br />people that we love.
5200680 5203103 And here's mine, Mia.
5203520 5205784 I want you to live.
5205960 5208340 I want that more than<br />anything in this world.
5208440 5212467 I want you to fight like<br />hell to stay with us.
5213320 5216380 But, with everybody else gone,
5216480 5218540 I know it might not be what you want.
5218640 5223304 It might be too hard for<br />you to keep fighting, so...
5225800 5228029 If you wanna go,
5228960 5231667 I want you to know it's okay.
5232200 5234065 It's okay.
5237160 5239503 I understand.
5250520 5252510 Thank you.
5260040 5261666 Gramps?
5315400 5317061 Hey.
5318880 5320620 Hey.
5324840 5326620 So many people have come to see you
5326720 5329621 I've lost count of them all.
5330440 5334180 There are like 30 people
5334280 5336305 in that waiting room.
5339240 5342664 Some are related to<br />you and some aren't,
5343680 5346023 but we're your family.
5348080 5351345 You still have a family, Mia.
5363000 5364831 Look.
5366160 5368700 This is my favorite picture of you.
5368800 5370301 Ever.
5372120 5374110 You were so happy that day.
5378000 5380264 And no matter what,
5380640 5383825 that's the way I'm always<br />gonna remember you.
5391800 5395940 The best day of my life was<br />one I never even saw coming.
5396040 5397220 It was Labor Day,
5397320 5401029 early this fall before things<br />started to go bad with Adam.
5401160 5405062 In some ways, it was just<br />like a usual potluck dinner.
5405520 5407780 But there was a special feel to it.
5407880 5409900 People kept on showing up.
5410000 5412380 All the old friends<br />from Dad's band days
5412480 5415580 and all the new ones<br />from Adam's band.
5415680 5418820 Willow and Henry were there<br />with their newborn baby.
5418920 5421420 Dad hauled the barbecue<br />out of the basement
5421520 5423940 and he and Teddy spent<br />the day flipping burgers.
5424040 5425900 And when it started to get dark
5426000 5429060 Henry had the bright<br />idea to start a bonfire.
5438040 5439541 Mia!
5442400 5444580 No way! I'm not playing for you guys.
5444680 5446260 Not for us, with us.
5446360 5447820 Seriously, Mia, if you don't, I will.
5447920 5450340 And have you ever heard the<br />sound of a thousand dying cats?
5450440 5453068 Come on, Hall.<br />We're playing together.
5453680 5456023 I really hate you all.
5462360 5463580 All right, Mia.
5463680 5465306 Gotta play for us, Mia.
5481800 5485140 I've always thought of the<br />cello as a solo instrument.
5485240 5488220 It's probably why it's always<br />made me so comfortable.
5488320 5490310 Just me and my cello.
5491600 5493900 But that night,<br />sitting around the bonfire,
5494000 5496660 jamming with Adam and everyone else,
5496760 5498460 I realized I was wrong.
5498560 5501500 The cello isn't a solo instrument.
5501600 5503380 It's part of something bigger.
5503480 5506780 Today is the greatest
5506880 5508980 Day I've ever known
5509080 5512540 Can't live for tomorrow
5512640 5514860 Tomorrow's much too long
5514960 5519146 I'll burn my eyes out
5520920 5525106 Before I get out
5526520 5529546 I wanted more
5532280 5537183 Than life could ever grant me
5537960 5541589 Bored by the chore
5543800 5547861 Of saving face
5549560 5553020 Today is the greatest
5553120 5555220 Day I've never known
5555320 5558820 Can't wait for tomorrow
5558920 5561020 I might not have that long
5561120 5565466 I'll tear my heart out
5566960 5571704 Before I get out
5580080 5581700 The thing is, Mom and Dad
5581800 5583220 always had their scene.
5583320 5584980 And Adam had his.
5585080 5588660 And I was always jealous<br />because I didn't have mine.
5588760 5591342 Until the night of the bonfire.
5591520 5593670 That was my scene.
5593920 5595380 That was where I belonged.
5599520 5602182 That's what happiness felt like.
5604840 5607502 But that could never exist again.
5729160 5731901 Just after this piece.
5776400 5778026 Adam.
5793320 5794660 Mia.
5794760 5795780 Don't.
5795880 5797711 Stay.
5799840 5802940 I know a huge part of your<br />life is forever ruined
5803040 5805780 because of what happened today.
5805880 5808500 I'm not dumb enough to<br />think that I can fix it.
5808600 5810590 You can't.
5811240 5813469 But I went to your house.
5814240 5818062 And I had to climb up the balcony<br />to get in like I used to.
5819680 5822911 And I found this in your mail slot.
5824120 5826220 I totally broke and entered<br />and stole your mail,

5954200 5959420 Ever love a heart like mine?
5959520 5964460 How could I live before?
5964560 5968380 How could I have been so blind?
5970400 5972740 So blind

5995960 6000749 How could I live before?
6000960 6002871 How could I have lived?
6023760 6025307 Mia.
6033760 6038470 Take my mind and take my pain
6041160 6046143 Like an empty bottle takes the rain
6048960 6054591 And heal, heal
6054760 6057388 Heal, heal
6060360 6065502 Take my past and take my sins
6067920 6073142 Like an empty sail takes the wind
6076000 6081347 And heal, heal
6081560 6084381 Heal, heal
6087440 6094949 And tell me some things last
6096800 6104024 And tell me some things last
6121360 6126070 Take my heart and take my hand
6128280 6133183 Like an ocean takes the dirty sands
6135840 6140660 And heal, heal
6140760 6143547 Heal, heal
6145880 6150669 Take my mind and take my pain
6153000 6157585 Like an empty bottle takes the rain

6186840 6193791 And tell me some things last
6195760 6202791 And tell me some things last
6216640 6219825 I spend these hollow nights
6220200 6223146 All alone
6226840 6230060 Safe from the looking glass
6230160 6233823 That you kept home
6236440 6238669 Let's go
6242240 6245060 I saw the sea and knew
6245160 6249631 It was a mirage
6252400 6255580 It wasn't even so
6255680 6259423 I played the odds
6263480 6266586 Full of black and blues
6268600 6271260 From all the nights with you
6271360 6273900 I never wanted to go
6274000 6276389 I don't want you anymore
6276520 6281540 I don't want you to<br />feel the same as me
6281640 6284140 I never wanted to go
6284240 6286580 But now I'm letting you know
6286680 6289100 I just wanted to feel
6289200 6294228 The life in me
6298360 6301620 I went from solid steel
6301720 6305463 To broken glass
6308600 6311740 The darkest side in me
6311840 6315071 You brought out fast
6319520 6322990 The things I said were true
6324640 6327460 I'm taking them back from you
6327560 6330140 I never wanted to go
6330240 6332740 I don't want you anymore
6332840 6337780 I don't want you to<br />feel the same as me
6337880 6340340 I never wanted to go
6340440 6342900 But now I'm letting you know
6343000 6345340 I just wanted to feel
6345440 6349661 The life in me
6349920 6352340 I miss you
6352440 6355102 I wish you
6355720 6358143 Will let me be
6360080 6362340 Just leave it
6362440 6364500 We stopped breathing
6364600 6368070 I need to be free
6368480 6370940 I never wanted to go
6371040 6373380 But now I'm letting you know
6373480 6375439 I just wanted to feel
6375440 6381663 The life in me
