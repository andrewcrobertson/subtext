11400 14882 <i>This is R. J. Cutler.<br />I am the director of If</i> I <i>Stay,</i>
15000 16161 <i>and I'm here with...</i>
16320 19449 <i>Alison Greenspan, the producer of If</i> I <i>Stay.</i>
19560 22848 <i>CUTLER: We're going to be, uh,<br />watching the movie</i>
22960 25611 <i>and talking about<br />the experience of making it,</i>
26280 30490 <i>and all of the wonderful things<br />that went on in the making.</i>
30640 33803 <i>I will begin by saying that</i>
33880 38124 <i>I think, Alison, the very first time you<br />and I met and we talked about the movie,</i>
38440 42365 <i>we talked about the fact<br />that, at the very beginning,</i>
42440 47128 <i>we would have this sense of<br />a larger perspective of the world,</i>
47200 51000 <i>that we would be seeing this,<br />in a way, from a God's-eye-view.</i>
51320 55484 <i>That's the opening image<br />of the film that we settled on,</i>
55800 57768 <i>that viewers can see<br />watching this right now.</i>
57880 59245 <i>GREENSPAN: Well, you always talked about</i>
59320 61561 <i>there being a spiritual component<br />to the movie,</i>
61640 65406 <i>and that there would be<br />this larger presence looking down.</i>
65480 67960 <i>That's why we come through the clouds</i>
68800 71451 <i>and find our family here,<br />the Hall family house.</i>
72160 77769 <i>CUTLER: And that spiritual component<br />is one of the things that</i>
78120 79804 <i>I experienced in reading the book.</i>
79880 82247 <i>I felt like every page was infused with that,</i>
82320 84607 <i>and the setting in the Pacific Northwest,</i>
84680 87331 <i>and the fact that we were<br />so much a part of nature.</i>
87480 89960 <i>I wonder what it was like for you.</i>
90040 93567 <i>When did you read the book first,<br />and what was your experience?</i>
93880 96850 <i>How did you decide that this was<br />a movie that you wanted to make?</i>
97600 99284 <i>GREENSPAN: Oddly enough, I read the book</i>
99360 101283 <i>when I was shooting a movie in Vancouver,</i>
101360 103362 <i>which we returned to for this film,</i>
103520 108970 <i>and, um, fell in love with<br />the bigger choice that Mia has.</i>
109040 115321 <i>The choice to live or die,<br />and the universal message of how people</i>
115560 119531 <i>get through great grief<br />and adversity and death and loss,</i>
119720 120846 <i>and come out the other side</i>
120920 125164 <i>and triumph and love and play music<br />and do all that great stuff.</i>
126920 129048 <i>Probably five years ago, six years ago.</i>
129160 132448 <i>CUTLER: Wow. For me,<br />it was a few years later.</i>
132640 135484 <i>You had been working on the movie<br />and getting it together,</i>
135560 138040 <i>and this script came to me.</i>
138200 140441 <i>Shauna Cross' script,<br />which I read and loved,</i>
140600 144730 <i>and it made me feel,<br />as soon as I was done reading it,</i>
144800 148122 <i>that the very next thing<br />I wanted to do was grab the book</i>
148200 153570 <i>and see what book had given birth<br />to this screenplay.</i>
153640 158646 <i>I read Gayle's book in one sitting,</i>
158760 161001 <i>as so many people have done,</i>
161080 163845 <i>and I couldn't believe the way it moved me.</i>
163920 168130 <i>In fact, in one of the margins,<br />at a particularly moving moment,</i>
168240 170163 <i>I wrote, "I think there is<br />something wrong with me."</i>
170240 173767 <i>- Because I just found it so deeply moving.<br />-(GREENSPAN LAUGHING)</i>
173920 178687 <i>CUTLER: It's really taken<br />the whole process of making the film</i>
179000 182368 <i>for me to realize that<br />what it was that was so moving</i>
182440 185728 <i>is that it's really a profoundly mythic tale.</i>
185800 190089 <i>In a way, it's the classic Grimms' fairytale</i>
190160 194404 <i>of the child who loses the parent<br />and is wandering in the woods,</i>
194480 199088 <i>looking for things to connect to</i>
199160 200161 that will help
200520 202682 <i>find the way<br />through the darkness,</i>
202760 206128 <i>and figure out what her identity is.</i>
206200 209727 <i>It's this very deeply human,<br />very profound thing</i>
209800 213043 <i>that involves the connections<br />we make in life,</i>
213120 216567 <i>and the way our lives change<br />by virtue of who we love,</i>
216640 219484 <i>and the way we go<br />from childhood to adulthood.</i>
219560 223360 <i>It means leaving our family home,<br />and all of those things.</i>
223440 227684 <i>I just found it so incredibly moving<br />that as soon as I was done,</i>
228800 231565 <i>I told everybody I knew<br />that I had to meet you,</i>
231640 233210 <i>so we could talk about making the film.</i>
233280 235282 <i>GREENSPAN: I have to say that<br />very first time we met,</i>
235360 238091 <i>- I fell in love with you...<br />- CUTLER: Aw.</i>
238160 240640 <i>GREENSPAN: ...and was so excited to<br />see the movie that was in your head.</i>
240920 243127 <i>But I loved how you encapsulated</i>
243200 245202 <i>the message of<br />what you were just talking about,</i>
245320 247527 <i>of that notion of,</i>
248600 250170 <i>"We are who we love. "</i>
250240 253608 <i>You said that line to me, and I thought<br />that summed up Mia's journey.</i>
253680 256763 <i>That she's her parents,<br />and even when they're gone,</i>
256920 259685 <i>they define who she is<br />because she loved them so much.</i>
260040 262361 <i>And then Adam takes that baton.</i>
262560 265609 <i>She is who she is because of his strength,</i>
265680 267887 <i>and she will carry on<br />because of him and Kim.</i>
268000 269240 <i>Here's Kim.</i>
269360 271124 <i>And that kind of friendship love.</i>
273360 276250 <i>CUTLER: All of that, of course,<br />is the thematic content of the movie,</i>
276360 278124 <i>but then there is this great narrative story</i>
278200 281966 <i>that is just an awesome story<br />of young love, on one hand.</i>
282400 288760 <i>Mia, this outsider cellist, and Adam,</i>
288840 291081 <i>this rock 'n' roll god,</i>
291360 294569 <i>who come together,<br />and you don't expect that,</i>
294880 299488 <i>um, they would fall in love.<br />They seem so different.</i>
299840 303811 <i>And yet, as Adam says in this very scene,<br />"I see you."</i>
303960 308841 <i>He does, and what he sees in her is<br />this profound connection to music.</i>
308960 315286 <i>So, the film also has<br />this deep musical foundation</i>
315600 318729 <i>that ties everybody in the film together,</i>
319200 322727 <i>and it also makes it<br />such an emotional story.</i>
323080 325970 <i>GREENSPAN: Well,<br />you always described music as</i>
326240 329244 <i>-maybe the fifth character in the movie.<br />- CUTLER: Mmm.</i>
329520 332569 <i>I think I used to say,<br />"it's the air that they breathe."</i>
332640 335610 <i>Everything is about music in this film.</i>
335680 339446 <i>In fact, later in the film, I was<br />doing an interview earlier this morning,</i>
339720 344601 <i>and there is a scene with Mia's grandfather<br />that's a really powerful scene,</i>
344760 347684 <i>and I think it's the one scene in the film<br />where there isn't any music.</i>
347760 349842 <i>And, in an way,<br />it's the most powerful scene.</i>
349920 354847 <i>But otherwise the film is<br />really wall-to-wall music.</i>
354920 359005 <i>When you see at the end, the credits,<br />there is so much music in this film.</i>
359240 362050 <i>There's Mia's music, and Adam's music,<br />and the parents' music.</i>
362120 363804 GREENSPAN: And <i>their</i> theme.
363960 365371 CUTLER: Say again?
365440 367124 <i>GREENSPAN: Their theme.<br />-Yeah, and their theme.</i>
367240 371040 <i>There's Heitor Pereira's beautiful music.</i>
371200 374124 <i>There's so much that drives the film,</i>
374200 377329 <i>so many different musical sensibilities.</i>
378080 379206 Um...
380160 383926 <i>I have also been struck recently,</i>
384000 387083 <i>in thinking back on the experience,<br />that when you and I first met,</i>
387160 389401 <i>in an effort to persuade you to hire me,</i>
389680 391648 <i>I put together a visual palette.</i>
391800 393768 <i>A series of images</i>
393840 397367 <i>that would define<br />the way the film would look,</i>
397480 402771 <i>and part of that were those big landscapes<br />of the Pacific Northwest.</i>
402880 408171 <i>But part of it were images that,<br />as we're looking at the Hall house here,</i>
408360 410806 <i>looked very much like<br />the interior of the Hall house.</i>
410880 414487 <i>Very much influenced by photographers,</i>
414840 418162 <i>this muted, primary-color palette.</i>
420280 422408 <i>It's interesting, looking back on that...</i>
422480 424164 <i>GREENSPAN: How true you were<br />to that initial vision.</i>
424240 425810 <i>CUTLER: Yeah, how much<br />it remained consistent.</i>
425880 429601 <i>It's a great lesson, in making films,</i>
429680 431842 <i>about how much your first instincts</i>
432720 436611 <i>end up being the most important instincts<br />that you have.</i>
436720 440645 <i>Those first responses<br />that we both had to reading the novel.</i>
440720 443724 <i>The first sense that we had<br />of Shauna's script,</i>
446440 450729 <i>the first visual instincts, the first<br />musical instincts, are so important.</i>
450800 454521 <i>GREENSPAN: You said initially that the<br />Hall house should be warm and full of life</i>
454640 456324 <i>and full of music,</i>
456400 460007 <i>and there's a rhythm in that house<br />and an energy.</i>
460080 464244 <i>You always described the nature<br />as being very crisp and white</i>
464560 466403 <i>and feeling the presence of God.</i>
466480 469051 <i>As they drive through here,</i>
469280 472250 <i>I think, A, how lucky we were<br />that it actually snowed</i>
472320 474049 (COMMENTATORS LAUGHING)
474160 476766 <i>the day we were going to shoot, and, B,</i>
477520 479284 <i>how you do feel that here.</i>
480680 485083 <i>CUTLER: So we have this great story,<br />this great raw material,</i>
485160 489927 <i>a great book that led to a great script,<br />and we were working together.</i>
490000 495291 <i>Of course, the next critical piece<br />in creating If</i> I <i>Stay was</i>
495880 497689 <i>who would play Mia?</i>
497880 502204 <i>What's your recollection<br />of Chloe's initial involvement?</i>
503120 506966 <i>GREENSPAN: My partner and I,<br />Denise and I, met Chloé,</i>
507040 510522 <i>and she felt like Mia.</i>
510600 514889 <i>Kind of innocent<br />and mature beyond her years,</i>
514960 519602 <i>and vulnerable, and yearning to fall in love.</i>
519760 521603 <i>She read the script,</i>
521920 524651 <i>and she told us that she loved you,<br />which was great.</i>
524720 527246 <i>She read the script and fell in love with it,</i>
527440 531161 <i>and, like you, went to the book<br />and really plugged into that journey.</i>
531560 534882 <i>I can't imagine the movie<br />with anybody else in it.</i>
534960 536883 <i>It's really quite amazing.</i>
536960 541284 <i>She and I met to discuss this<br />and instantly connected.</i>
541400 545962 <i>I think I told you afterwards it was<br />as if I had been meeting with myself.</i>
546320 551451 <i>She would articulate things<br />that I had thought and felt and said</i>
551520 553010 <i>in other settings.</i>
555120 559728 <i>We connected to all of the same themes</i>
559800 562326 <i>and the same aspects of the story.</i>
562400 565404 <i>What really struck me</i>
565480 568450 <i>was that here was Chloé Moretz,</i>
569880 573771 <i>a 17-year-old child prodigy, really,</i>
573840 577049 <i>who had been acting<br />with great accomplishment</i>
577120 578690 <i>since...</i>
579000 581446 <i>- How old? Five years old? Six years old?<br />-GREENSPAN: I think five, yeah.</i>
581680 583045 <i>CUTLER: Um...</i>
583120 588524 <i>And that she would be playing Mia Hall,<br />a child prodigy</i>
588600 592366 <i>who had this gift as a young cellist.</i>
592520 597367 <i>We spoke, Chloé and I,<br />at that very first meeting</i>
597440 599363 <i>about the fact, um,</i>
600720 604122 <i>that she and Mia were very much related</i>
604200 606601 <i>because of that prodigious talent<br />that they have.</i>
606680 607966 <i>And because, to some extent,</i>
608040 610327 <i>neither of them fully understand<br />where it comes from.</i>
610400 613529 <i>Both of them have had to<br />work so hard to develop it.</i>
613600 618367 <i>But both of them are, in a way,<br />talented beyond their own comprehension,</i>
618440 619930 <i>in a really exciting way.</i>
620120 624125 <i>Also, both of them<br />are very down-to-earth, very real.</i>
624320 627005 <i>Um, it's one of the things</i>
627080 629481 <i>that everybody<br />who meets Chloé says about her,</i>
629560 633201 <i>is that she's so real, she seems so normal,<br />and it's true.</i>
633320 636403 <i>She's just a normal kid.</i>
636480 639563 <i>She just happens to be<br />this remarkably talented actress.</i>
639680 644208 <i>I knew that, that quality would be<br />something that she would bring to Mia,</i>
644280 646248 <i>and it would be a really exciting thing.</i>
646360 648966 <i>GREENSPAN: She got that.<br />She also got, I think,</i>
649080 654291 <i>(EXHALES) that vulnerability that makes<br />Mia feel like an outsider in her family</i>
654360 656249 <i>and in her world sometimes,</i>
656440 660126 <i>and the joy that she felt<br />at the end of the movie, discovering,</i>
660200 662771 <i>"Actually, I was very loved,</i>
662880 665611 <i>"and I was at the center of it all, all along.</i>
665920 667001 <i>"I just had to realize that."</i>
667080 668570 <i>CUTLER". She has such a strong family bond</i>
668640 670608 <i>with her mom and her brothers.</i>
670720 672449 <i>It's such a part of her identity.</i>
672520 676923 <i>So, here was an actress who was able<br />to bring all of those qualities</i>
677080 680846 <i>to this performance and to creating Mia.</i>
680960 683486 <i>As you see throughout the film,<br />she does that.</i>
683640 684766 Um...
684840 689209 <i>The next challenge, of course,<br />was finding an Adam.</i>
689280 690441 G RE E N S PAN: Hoo-hoo-
691760 695321 <i>CUTLER: That was particularly difficult<br />because I was insisting</i>
695400 698768 <i>that he not only be<br />a perfect Adam as an actor...</i>
699320 700890 <i>GREENSPAN: But a singer.<br />-...but a singer</i>
700960 702928 <i>-and a guitar player.<br />-GREENSPAN: The real deal.</i>
703000 704764 <i>CUTLER". Somebody who you would believe</i>
704840 706763 <i>could be this budding rock star.</i>
709040 711042 <i>Sometimes we would rassle about that,</i>
711120 713930 <i>whether or not he really needed<br />to be able to play and sing.</i>
714000 715001 <i>GREENSPAN: No.<br />You wanted it to be authentic.</i>
715080 716161 <i>CUTLER". I was very insistent about it.</i>
716240 717810 <i>GREENSPAN: You thought<br />people would read</i>
717880 719962 <i>right through it if he were lip-synching,</i>
720040 722691 <i>and you were totally right about that.</i>
722760 726970 <i>'Cause those scenes play<br />so real and electric because of his gift.</i>
727600 733164 <i>CUTLER: But finding a guy who was<br />all of those things and a heartthrob,</i>
733240 736642 <i>who passed the Alison test of,<br />"Girls will love him."</i>
737160 738924 <i>It wasn't easy.</i>
739000 742925 <i>GREENSPAN: When he came in to sing,<br />you remember that,</i>
743120 744724 <i>you couldn't take your eyes off him.</i>
744800 746040 <i>And Chloé said the same thing.</i>
746160 750290 <i>He left the room and she was like,<br />"it has to be him! No one else."</i>
750360 753045 <i>CUTLER: Yes. She was very insistent.<br />Well, we searched high and low,</i>
753200 758286 <i>and finally when we met Jamie<br />and brought him in</i>
759560 763360 <i>to meet with Chloé, it was pretty electric.<br />It was awesome.</i>
763520 765761 <i>We couldn't stop taking pictures of them</i>
765840 767604 <i>because they were so adorable together.</i>
767680 770126 <i>GREENSPAN: And you wanted to<br />see them kiss, too.</i>
770560 772130 <i>- I think.<br />- CUTLER: Indeed. Yeah, absolutely.</i>
772200 773247 <i>You just wanted to see them be together.</i>
773320 774606 <i>GREENSPAN: There was<br />a heat between them.</i>
774680 776284 <i>CUTLER: They were so real together.</i>
776360 778681 <i>So, they had that chemistry,<br />which was so important.</i>
781040 783327 <i>But they also had, individually,</i>
783400 787485 <i>all the characteristics<br />that were so important to us</i>
790240 792242 <i>in finding the right actors for those roles.</i>
792360 793771 Um...
793840 798448 <i>Rounding out the cast, of course,<br />was Mia's best friend.</i>
798600 800489 <i>GREENSPAN: The great Liana Liberate.</i>
800560 805202 <i>CUTLER: The great Liana Liberato,<br />who actually auditioned for this role</i>
805280 806566 <i>and made me cry.</i>
806680 808409 <i>GREENSPAN: She was the first person<br />we saw, I think.</i>
808560 810050 <i>CUTLER". For Kim.</i>
810160 811571 <i>GREENSPAN: And we cried.<br />And we thought,</i>
811640 813529 <i>"Well, how do you top that?"</i>
813600 816046 <i>CUTLER: it's very difficult.<br />It was difficult to imagine.</i>
816160 817730 <i>She gave the perfect audition.</i>
817800 819723 (CUTLER STAMMERING)
822400 825643 <i>It was her bedside speech to Mia</i>
826760 829286 <i>that she performed,</i>
829360 832648 <i>and it was just so pure and true and real</i>
832920 834604 <i>and honest.</i>
834800 837565 <i>All of the things that I respond most to.</i>
838640 840688 <i>I think everybody responds most to.</i>
841640 844007 <i>And so we grabbed her immediately.</i>
844600 845886 <i>GREENSPAN: Snapped her up.</i>
845960 850682 <i>CUTLER: But I think the first person<br />after Chloé that we cast was Mireille.</i>
850760 851921 <i>GREENSPAN'. Mireille. Yeah.</i>
852000 854606 <i>CUTLER". And we met her,<br />and she loved the material so much,</i>
854800 857804 <i>and she connected to it so much as a mom,</i>
858680 863846 <i>that we couldn't pass up the opportunity.</i>
863920 866571 <i>Of course, Mireille Enos is<br />one of the great actresses.</i>
866640 872044 <i>The idea that we would have her<br />to work with was so thrilling.</i>
872120 874282 <i>GREENSPAN: She's a groovy chick.</i>
874360 878081 <i>When you meet her, she's...<br />We wanted a cat who was cool,</i>
878160 882290 <i>and pretty, and the mom<br />that you long to have,</i>
882480 883561 <i>'cause a lot of us are<br />embarrassed</i>
883920 884921 of our moms.
885000 887321 <i>And she is just so cool. Look at her.</i>
888160 891084 <i>CUTLER: I would like to say for the record,<br />I am not embarrassed by my mom.</i>
891200 893123 <i>GREENSPAN: Me neither. I'm just saying.<br />-Thank you.</i>
893480 898611 <i>Um, and then there was Denny,<br />uh, Josh Leonard,</i>
898960 902931 <i>who, again, I keep on going back to this,</i>
903000 906561 <i>but the idea of initial response,<br />first instincts,</i>
906640 909849 <i>when you think something is right.</i>
909960 913601 <i>If you trust it, chances are<br />things will work out really well.</i>
913680 916968 <i>I remember Josh came in,<br />and we were all like,</i>
917040 919520 <i>"Whoa! That's Denny. There he is."</i>
919600 922001 <i>He had that tattoo, he rolled up his sleeves.</i>
922080 923081 <i>He had his tattoo.</i>
923160 924810 <i>GREENSPAN: I looked at his arms,<br />and thought, "Mmm-hmm."</i>
924880 927087 <i>CUTLER". He just had it. He nailed it.</i>
927160 929447 <i>- He was Denny.<br />-GREENSPAN: And the beard.</i>
929520 933684 <i>CUTLER". Yeah, and it was great.</i>
933800 936804 <i>So, we put our cast together.<br />We had one more person.</i>
936880 939565 <i>Obviously, it was a much bigger cast.</i>
939640 944009 <i>We had to put together Adam's band<br />and we had to fill out the family.</i>
944080 945844 <i>But then we also</i>
946720 949690 <i>searched high and low<br />for the perfect Gramps,</i>
949880 952884 <i>and found out<br />that Stacy Keach was available,</i>
952960 956009 <i>which was a great coup for us.</i>
956080 960927 <i>Of course, Gramps, in many ways,</i>
961320 966008 <i>provides the heart and soul of this story,<br />his connection to Mia,</i>
966080 968242 <i>and the way that he changes over the story,</i>
968360 972126 <i>which is something that you don't<br />expect to see, and is so surprising</i>
972240 977451 <i>and so moving<br />in the final portion of the film.</i>
978360 981170 <i>It was great to have him.</i>
981240 983242 <i>And he's a tough guy.</i>
983440 985010 GREENSPAN: He <i>is</i> so macho.
985080 987208 <i>CUTLER: He brought that energy.<br />It was amazing.</i>
987520 990410 <i>GREENSPAN: When he cries and tells her,</i>
991600 993409 <i>"if you have to go,</i>
994240 995890 <i>"then go."</i>
996120 999363 <i>I cry every time I see him say that</i>
999440 1002728 <i>because you don't expect<br />this big bear of a guy</i>
1003600 1004601 <i>to tear up.</i>
1004760 1006728 <i>- It's so moving.<br />- CUTLER: So moving.</i>
1007160 1011484 <i>So, there we were,<br />and we put our whole cast together,</i>
1011560 1015087 <i>and built our production team,<br />and went up to Vancouver.</i>
1015200 1016964 <i>GREENSPAN". The Great White North.<br />-The Great White North,</i>
1017040 1021762 <i>which is doubling for Portland, Oregon.</i>
1022920 1025400 <i>We were shooting<br />in November and December,</i>
1025480 1029690 <i>and the thing about shooting in Vancouver<br />in November and December is,</i>
1029760 1034482 <i>you have about three hours<br />of daylight a day, would you say?</i>
1034560 1036369 <i>- Maybe four.<br />GREENSPAN: Four, and it usually rains.</i>
1036440 1041128 <i>But we lucked out in that<br />it snowed when we needed it to,</i>
1041200 1046491 <i>and it rained less than<br />most winter months there.</i>
1046560 1048722 <i>It was pretty dry.</i>
1049960 1052725 <i>- CUTLER: Yeah, it was kind of dry.<br />- We lucked out.</i>
1052880 1054041 <i>That's how I remember it.</i>
1054120 1056009 <i>CUTLER: I know, it's a beautiful thing,<br />the way you remember.</i>
1056080 1057241 -(GREENSPAN CHUCKLING)<br />-CUTLER: <i>I</i> remember
1057320 1060802 <i>darkness and rain and fog<br />so you couldn't see your own hand.</i>
1060880 1062291 <i>GREENSPAN: Look at this beautiful night.</i>
1062360 1064124 <i>CUTLER: I know, and yet,<br />I'm sure you're right,</i>
1064200 1066043 <i>because every night was beautiful</i>
1066160 1071007 <i>and dry and so many scenes<br />that are in this film were shot in the rain</i>
1071080 1073401 <i>and yet, somehow you don't even know.</i>
1073480 1077485 <i>Of course, this was a beautiful night,<br />the night of Adam and Mia's first date.</i>
1079800 1082167 <i>We were able to shoot<br />those beautiful wide shots.</i>
1082240 1086928 <i>Somehow, even though it's December,<br />it looks like</i>
1088360 1090840 <i>a beautiful spring day, doesn't it?</i>
1091840 1095208 <i>GREENSPAN: it does. I applaud you<br />for this specific scene,</i>
1095320 1100406 <i>it just makes the movie feel so big<br />and like they've really gone somewhere</i>
1101120 1103168 <i>romantic and special.</i>
1106000 1109049 <i>CUTLER: Well, this is a great example<br />of every department</i>
1109640 1110880 <i>working on all cylinders.</i>
1111000 1113287 <i>You look at this image and you see</i>
1113360 1118127 <i>Brent Thomas' beautiful production design,</i>
1118400 1120050 <i>great locations.</i>
1121360 1124330 <i>- You see John de Borman's shooting.<br />-GREENSPAN: Beautiful lighting.</i>
1126560 1128608 <i>CUTLER: Which is amazing,<br />the way the camera</i>
1128680 1132048 <i>moves down the steps with these guys,</i>
1132120 1135203 <i>and you're just swept up<br />in a certain romanticism.</i>
1135400 1137801 <i>You see Monique Prudhomme's<br />awesome costumes.</i>
1137880 1140645 <i>They couldn't look better, more adorable,</i>
1140880 1146808 <i>more appropriate,<br />these kids dressed up on a grown-up date.</i>
1149440 1152330 <i>Every shot captures the emotion<br />that we were</i>
1152880 1153881 seeking to find.
1154080 1157084 <i>It worked out.</i>
1157240 1158366 Um...
1158760 1161730 <i>On the screen now we're seeing</i>
1161800 1165407 <i>Adam and Mia<br />on their second date, which is</i>
1165760 1168604 <i>when Adam invites Mia to<br />hear his band play for the first time.</i>
1170160 1172288 <i>It bears us talking a little bit about the band.</i>
1172400 1174880 <i>GREENSPAN: And how we put them<br />together, that kismet moment</i>
1174960 1176689 <i>when we met these guys</i>
1176960 1180487 <i>who described being in an awful accident.</i>
1180600 1183524 <i>They played for us<br />and they were unbelievable,</i>
1183600 1186206 <i>but we were really moved by their story,</i>
1186280 1189921 <i>and just the sheer coincidence<br />of how similar it was</i>
1190120 1192771 <i>to Mia being in an accident and surviving.</i>
1194440 1197808 <i>And them going on<br />to continue with their music.</i>
1198600 1200728 <i>CUTLER: So, these guys<br />were actually in a band,</i>
1200800 1203849 <i>and we said, "Come be Adam's band."</i>
1203960 1208443 <i>They had had an eerily similar experience,</i>
1212560 1217361 <i>and we figured they'll provide<br />this great backup band.</i>
1217440 1219807 <i>And then there was<br />a question of seeing, really,</i>
1220280 1223045 <i>do they have chemistry with Jamie?</i>
1223320 1228804 <i>Because just as important<br />as it was for Mia and Adam,</i>
1228880 1231884 <i>for the actors playing Mia and Adam<br />to have a certain chemistry,</i>
1232000 1235083 <i>it was almost equally important</i>
1235240 1238403 <i>for Adam and the members of his band<br />to have a real chemistry.</i>
1238480 1240847 <i>Because these guys, these are Adam's...</i>
1240920 1243207 <i>Before he meets Mia,<br />these are Adam's soul mates.</i>
1243280 1245408 <i>These are the people he creates with.</i>
1245480 1247687 <i>These are the people who form his identity.</i>
1249360 1252125 <i>We lucked out<br />because they really did connect.</i>
1252200 1253247 GREENSPAN: You <i>buy</i> it.
1253320 1258451 <i>CUTLER: But we also helped that process<br />by getting the band together</i>
1258520 1260841 a <i>good two weeks<br />before we started production.</i>
1260960 1263167 <i>GREENSPAN: Every day they hung out.<br />-They were together every day.</i>
1263320 1266164 <i>We gave them studio time to record.</i>
1266240 1268163 <i>They rehearsed together as a band.</i>
1268240 1270971 <i>GREENSPAN: In fact, they went out<br />with Chloé and Liana.</i>
1271080 1275130 <i>They would go out to the movies,<br />or go out to dinner and just chill.</i>
1275200 1277885 <i>CUTLER". That two weeks, that bonding time</i>
1277960 1279928 <i>paid off so much in production</i>
1280040 1283044 <i>because you felt like these people<br />had been together a long time.</i>
1283120 1284360 <i>GREENSPAN: They knew each other.<br />They were buds.</i>
1284440 1285601 <i>CUTLER". And they had made music together</i>
1285720 1287006 <i>for a long time, which was great.</i>
1287200 1292286 <i>They also worked with John Carrafa,<br />who was our awesome musical stager.</i>
1292360 1297924 <i>He worked with them on<br />how a band would carry itself on stage,</i>
1298040 1300122 <i>and they really responded to that.</i>
1300240 1303881 <i>They had formed this unified whole,<br />which was terrific.</i>
1305360 1306930 We're cool, right?
1307000 1308240 - You and me?<br />- Yeah.
1308360 1310044 We're cool.
1310200 1312521 - Hey, you finally got to meet Liz.<br />- Yeah.
1313200 1314725 You two have a lot in common.
1315360 1316407 You ever, like,
1317080 1318445 hooked up, or...
1319520 1324242 <i>CUTLER: I just remember the night<br />of that performance we just watched,</i>
1324440 1326522 <i>which was the first performance we filmed.</i>
1326960 1329770 <i>When we shot it, thinking, "Wow, he is..."</i>
1329840 1331365 <i>GREENSPAN: A star.<br />-"He is the rock star</i>
1331440 1333204 <i>"we knew he would be."</i>
1333440 1335807 <i>You can know that<br />somebody is going to be that,</i>
1335920 1339129 <i>you can have the instinct and think,</i>
1339280 1341601 <i>"For sure, he's going to be a star<br />when he gets on stage."</i>
1341760 1342841 <i>But until he gets on stage...</i>
1342920 1344843 - GREENSPAN: You don't know.<br />-...and the camera's rolling,
1344920 1348083 <i>and the audience is there,<br />you never know for sure.</i>
1348200 1350646 <i>And, man, he so rose to the occasion.</i>
1350720 1352404 <i>GREENSPAN: Do you remember<br />also sitting there,</i>
1352480 1354687 <i>shooting that scene, and seeing the girls...</i>
1354760 1358845 <i>'Cause we had to do it, what, 30? 40 times?</i>
1358960 1361361 <i>And after hearing it five times,</i>
1361480 1363960 <i>they were singing along<br />and singing the lyrics, (LAUGHS)</i>
1364160 1366322 <i>jumping up and down. I'm going,<br />"That's a great sign, too.</i>
1366400 1368368 <i>"They really like the song,<br />and they like him."</i>
1368440 1369566 <i>CUTLER". Absolutely.</i>
1370440 1374365 <i>Um, while we're talking about music,<br />there's, I mentioned before,</i>
1374440 1376681 <i>wall-to-wall music in this film</i>
1377760 1379922 <i>and all sorts of different kinds of music.</i>
1380000 1383527 <i>But there is a defining concept<br />behind all of that,</i>
1383600 1385409 <i>whether it's, uh,</i>
1387760 1391162 <i>the punk-oriented music that you hear,</i>
1391240 1393527 <i>the grunge-oriented music,<br />or the new wave,</i>
1393600 1395682 <i>or the contemporary, more pop sound.</i>
1396360 1399443 <i>The concept that I was working with</i>
1399880 1400927 was that
1403000 1407483 <i>kids today, people today,<br />you and I today, anybody,</i>
1407800 1411282 <i>has at their disposal,<br />at their immediate access,</i>
1411720 1414883 <i>pretty much every song<br />that's ever been recorded.</i>
1414960 1417930 <i>We can get it online.<br />We can get it on YouTube.</i>
1418120 1421442 <i>We can get it through a streaming service.<br />If you have satellite radio, you can get it.</i>
1421520 1425684 <i>As a result, young artists like Adam and Mia</i>
1425760 1428411 <i>are going to be influenced, really,</i>
1428640 1432645 <i>by all of rock 'n' roll, all of popular music,</i>
1432720 1436088 <i>and, if they have the taste for it,<br />music that pre-dates rock 'n' roll.</i>
1436200 1439602 <i>So they are as likely to be influenced<br />by their parents' music</i>
1439720 1441848 <i>as by music of their own time period.</i>
1442040 1447046 <i>And that was something that really<br />informed the choices that we made</i>
1447120 1450169 <i>in putting together<br />the soundtrack for the film.</i>
1450240 1451287 <i>It was very important.</i>
1451360 1455729 <i>Sometimes it led us to spirited debates<br />with our friends at the studio</i>
1455800 1457609 <i>about including older songs.</i>
1457680 1460001 <i>They said, "What's Blondie<br />doing on this soundtrack?"</i>
1460080 1461650 <i>And we'd have</i> to...
1461720 1462960 <i>GREENSPAN: No, you really<br />made the point that</i>
1463040 1468331 <i>I think teenagers today,<br />I do, certainly, we all listen to Blondie.</i>
1468440 1472286 <i>And why not? Why wouldn't it be<br />at a party that they go to?</i>
1472360 1474601 <i>CUTLER: It's just as much<br />a part of who Adam is.</i>
1474680 1476921 <i>In a way, just as much a part of who Mia is,</i>
1477920 1482642 <i>music that's 30-40 years old<br />as music that is brand-new.</i>
1482720 1485087 <i>And we have plenty of<br />contemporary music as well.</i>
1485680 1488126 <i>Anyway, you talked earlier about</i>
1488200 1491249 <i>the distinct looks that<br />we were going to achieve.</i>
1493240 1497404 <i>There was the colorful,<br />the muted primaries,</i>
1497600 1501082 <i>the look of the Hall family home,</i>
1502240 1505005 <i>and then there is</i>
1506040 1512685 <i>the cold, blue, monochromatic<br />look of the hospital.</i>
1512760 1517846 <i>It's another place where our awesome</i>
1519920 1521763 <i>production design team,</i>
1521960 1526249 <i>costume design team, and DP</i>
1527880 1531043 <i>were able to work together<br />in complete harmony</i>
1531120 1532884 <i>to create this distinct look.</i>
1533000 1535321 <i>And you see the jump<br />between those two looks.</i>
1535440 1537727 GREENSPAN: Yeah. When you come in here<br /><i>with</i> that orange wall...
1537800 1539131 <i>CUTLER: It's just a completely<br />different world.</i>
1539200 1540440 <i>GREENSPAN'. ...and the livelihood...</i>
1540600 1544286 <i>CUTLER: And that, I think, has a real strong<br />emotional impact on the viewer.</i>
1544960 1548203 <i>GREENSPAN: It does. I think<br />also the other thing that you,</i>
1548280 1551250 <i>um, were really smart about<br />is the memories</i>
1551360 1554409 <i>that Mia has. When she flashes back,</i>
1554480 1557563 <i>they look like these warm Kodachrome...</i>
1557640 1560211 <i>That's a whole other look<br />that you shot in a different way.</i>
1560280 1561361 <i>CUTLER: Yeah, there were distinct looks.</i>
1561440 1562805 <i>We always talked about the distinct looks.</i>
1562880 1567727 <i>The memory shots were meant to<br />feel like home movies of the mind.</i>
1569680 1573605 <i>It's where my background<br />as a documentary filmmaker</i>
1573680 1577571 <i>really came most into play<br />'cause I wanted it to be handheld.</i>
1578520 1580682 <i>They were always improvised,<br />those moments,</i>
1580760 1582728 <i>and we shot them on the fly.</i>
1582840 1586162 <i>As you remember, there was<br />never much time to do them,</i>
1586320 1589210 <i>so we were always just grabbing<br />a camera and running and gunning.</i>
1589320 1592529 <i>But it had that feel of life,</i>
1592680 1595206 <i>those moments that you remember<br />of your childhood,</i>
1595360 1598443 <i>those moments that<br />you remember of your family, those...</i>
1600040 1602407 <i>GREENSPAN: Snapshots of time, yeah.<br />-Exactly.</i>
1603360 1605601 - We got to get the stinger out.<br />- No, we're not doing that.
1606680 1608205 <i>CUTLER: What do you think<br />when you see this scene?</i>
1609080 1613324 <i>GREENSPAN: I just love<br />Mireille's reaction right here.</i>
1613400 1614526 (GREENSPAN CHUCKLES)
1614600 1615886 <i>I think it's genius.</i>
1616040 1617849 <i>- That's so what</i> a <i>mom does.<br />- CUTLER: It's something...</i>
1617920 1621720 <i>This was a great thing, again,<br />about Josh and Mireille,</i>
1621840 1624764 <i>-is that they brought that...<br />- GREENSPAN: They ad-Iibbed.</i>
1625160 1628721 <i>...parental truth to it.</i>
1629160 1632721 I'm sorry to say that's the furthest<br />we've gotten since our first date.
1633040 1637443 <i>CUTLER: One of the things<br />I'm reminded of watching this is</i>
1639240 1642449 <i>the way that Paul Barry,<br />our assistant director,</i>
1642560 1646281 <i>and circumstance broke out our schedule,</i>
1646880 1650089 <i>I think, was really critical<br />to the success of the film.</i>
1650440 1653683 <i>We started shooting<br />in the Hall family home,</i>
1654080 1657641 <i>and even though it was this tiny house</i>
1657880 1659928 <i>that no film ever<br />should have been shooting in,</i>
1660080 1663641 <i>because we were literally<br />hanging out the windows.</i>
1665280 1667248 <i>The house couldn't contain all of us.</i>
1667400 1670483 <i>Getting cameras up and down<br />that narrow staircase was impossible.</i>
1670600 1674082 <i>GREENSPAN: Or up a balcony, yeah.<br />-It was nuts, what we had to do there.</i>
1674720 1678520 <i>It was great that we were in the house<br />for about a week and a half</i>
1678600 1681683 <i>because it allowed the family to bond.</i>
1681760 1682921 GREENSPAN: We had no choice.
1683000 1684570 <i>CUTLER: it allowed us to do<br />all those family scenes</i>
1684640 1688167 <i>in a way that really solidified<br />this family unit.</i>
1688280 1689441 GREENSPAN: They were <i>close.</i>
1689920 1691888 <i>CUTLER: It made it real,</i>
1692040 1695965 <i>and it also, of course, gave Chloé<br />that emotional foundation,</i>
1696080 1698208 <i>so that when she lost them,</i>
1699120 1702806 <i>she was playing off<br />something that was very, very real.</i>
1703800 1706485 <i>We then shot everything else<br />in the movie except the hospital,</i>
1706680 1709206 <i>and then we finished the film<br />in the hospital,</i>
1709360 1713604 <i>so there was really a sense of loss<br />that informed all of that.</i>
1713880 1715006 Um...
1716080 1718890 <i>Here, of course, we have<br />their first love scene,</i>
1719040 1721281 <i>which was so great</i>
1721400 1724529 <i>and a little bit nerve-racking</i>
1724640 1726881 <i>because we didn't know<br />they hadn't kissed before.</i>
1727160 1730642 <i>We didn't know what that would be like<br />and how it would play.</i>
1731080 1732286 Um...
1733440 1735602 <i>But I think it quite worked out.</i>
1736200 1738851 <i>GREENSPAN: Yeah, I think<br />they strode the line of being</i>
1738920 1743801 <i>completely nervous and excited and into it.</i>
1746320 1750689 <i>She brings me back to my first kiss.</i>
1750840 1753002 <i>She plays it so real</i>
1753840 1756571 <i>and just plugged into that grounded-ness.</i>
1758440 1759851 <i>CUTLER". That was the thing, wasn't it?</i>
1759960 1763009 <i>- When in doubt, be real and true.<br />-GREENSPAN: Be real.</i>
1763440 1765090 <i>CUTLER: Always, always, always.</i>
1766440 1769011 <i>I remember, I would say to them,</i>
1769760 1772491 <i>"if you believe in it,<br />everybody else will believe in it,</i>
1772600 1776321 <i>"and that's all that matters.<br />Just always be real."</i>
1777200 1782366 <i>And they were. There's so much detail<br />in the performance and connection.</i>
1782520 1784488 <i>You see in her eyes...</i>
1787240 1790528 <i>There are</i> a <i>lot of great scenes in this<br />movie, but this is one of my favorites.</i>
1795200 1799967 <i>GREENSPAN: I don't think Adam's ever<br />opened up to anyone before</i>
1800480 1804724 <i>this moment, and<br />that's why it felt so exciting.</i>
1804880 1807611 <i>Normally, you see the girl spill her guts,</i>
1807760 1811401 <i>and he shares something that<br />really brings them close together.</i>
1811800 1815725 <i>CUTLER: Now, this sequence we call<br />the "falling in love" montage</i>
1815880 1819043 <i>was another part of the film</i>
1819120 1822249 <i>that we filmed in this run-and-gun style.</i>
1822360 1825443 <i>We had maybe 20 minutes<br />to shoot this sequence.</i>
1825920 1828400 <i>No idea what was going to happen</i>
1828520 1831285 <i>except that they were going<br />to be falling in love on a rainy day.</i>
1831400 1833402 <i>That's all I think that I had ever written.</i>
1833560 1835528 <i>Maybe that there was<br />a skateboard involved.</i>
1835760 1838889 <i>We were running out of time in production.</i>
1839040 1843125 <i>I think this was one of our last days<br />before we had to go to the hospital.</i>
1843240 1845846 <i>We were running the risk</i>
1846280 1847770 of not using that,
1847880 1851521 <i>not being able to shoot that scene</i>
1851640 1853369 <i>-in our schedule.<br />-GREENSPAN: It's so important, too.</i>
1853440 1856887 <i>CUTLER: We just had 20 minutes<br />between locations</i>
1857080 1860129 <i>and we said, "Just grab the camera, guys.<br />Go out in the rain."</i>
1860200 1861486 <i>GREENSPAN: They were real good sports.</i>
1861560 1863005 <i>CUTLER". You couldn't see it in the scene,<br />of course,</i>
1863080 1865606 <i>but people were running around<br />with umbrellas, trying to do their best</i>
1865800 1867484 <i>to keep the rain away from them.</i>
1868240 1870925 <i>Of course, we ended up using<br />every single frame of that sequence.</i>
1872120 1874441 <i>If we had had more,<br />we would have used more.</i>
1874760 1875966 Kim, wait!
1876440 1879125 <i>CUTLER: So, in the hospital,</i>
1879240 1882084 <i>the scene you're seeing now,</i>
1883040 1885361 <i>the big question was how will...</i>
1885440 1889604 <i>Not only the visual style,<br />but the way the camera is used,</i>
1889680 1892081 <i>how will it communicate</i>
1893040 1894929 <i>that Mia is not real,</i>
1895080 1897242 <i>that she has a spirit presence?</i>
1897360 1899249 <i>I remember, again,</i>
1900000 1903607 <i>my initial impulse, and something<br />you and I spoke about the day we met,</i>
1903720 1906963 <i>was that it should always be grounded,<br />it should always be real.</i>
1907320 1910005 Now, I haven't been able<br />to speak to anyone's doctors yet,
1910080 1912731 but I do know that Mia and Dennis<br />are still in surgery.
1912800 1914245 <i>CUTLER: There could be<br />a version of this story</i>
1914320 1915924 <i>where it's about the visual effects.</i>
1916040 1920170 <i>It's about what I would call<br />the ooh-iness of it.</i>
1920240 1921969 (CUTLER STAMMERING)
1926480 1929802 <i>In a way, to me, that would<br />make it more about death</i>
1929920 1931126 <i>and less about life.</i>
1931760 1933285 <i>And I wanted her to feel very, very alive.</i>
1933400 1934925 <i>I didn't want her to be transparent.</i>
1935360 1937442 G <i>RE</i> E N S <i>PAN: Or ugly, or ghost-like.</i>
1937560 1939483 <i>CUTLER". Or ghost-like, any of those things.</i>
1939680 1942365 <i>I wanted her to be as real as possible.</i>
1942760 1944285 <i>So, we ended up</i>
1945280 1947044 <i>really relying on the Steadicam</i>
1947320 1950529 <i>to give a sense not only of her point of view,</i>
1950680 1956005 <i>but also of the floating sense<br />of her presence.</i>
1956120 1960330 <i>Between that and<br />the way Monique dressed her,</i>
1960560 1966408 <i>it communicated that she was<br />this otherworldly spirit in these scenes.</i>
1966560 1969166 <i>- And I think they work really well.<br />- GREENSPAN: Very well, yeah.</i>
1971200 1976001 <i>CUTLER: So, the Liana-Chloé connection<br />was, of course, another important...</i>
1977120 1978724 <i>They had to have a certain chemistry.</i>
1978800 1981167 <i>They had known each other before.<br />They had worked together,</i>
1981280 1985808 <i>or had met as young actresses<br />in Hollywood.</i>
1986080 1988526 <i>So, they had a little bit of a friendship,</i>
1988760 1991809 <i>but that friendship really blossomed<br />over the course of making the film.</i>
1991920 1993081 <i>GREENSPAN". They became best friends.</i>
1993200 1997285 <i>CUTLER: Their connection was just, again,<br />so real and so genuine,</i>
1997560 2001201 <i>and they would spend pretty much<br />all of their down-time together.</i>
2001760 2006607 <i>And this is something<br />that you can't make up.</i>
2006760 2007761 <i>You can't fake it.</i>
2007880 2010531 <i>And so, you get that sense<br />between the two of them.</i>
2010720 2012085 <i>This is such a real scene.</i>
2012320 2014926 <i>They were so relaxed and into it.</i>
2015000 2016081 <i>Of course, the original scene</i>
2016240 2020450 <i>is about five minutes longer<br />than this edited version.</i>
2020520 2023842 <i>You kept on saying to me,<br />"it's a joke on a joke on a joke on a joke,"</i>
2023920 2025365 <i>and I was like, "I know,<br />but I wanna see it end."</i>
2025440 2027124 <i>- And eventually, we edited it down.<br />-(GREENSPAN LAUGHING)</i>
2027360 2029169 <i>GREENSPAN: But I also said,<br />"Girls are gonna eat it up."</i>
2029240 2031971 <i>Because it does feel like how we talk.</i>
2032240 2037326 <i>CUTLER: Exactly. And that girlfriend<br />relationship is so important to who you are</i>
2037720 2039290 <i>when you're 16 years old.</i>
2041480 2042845 <i>Again, we're back in the house,</i>
2042920 2046129 <i>and it's worth just looking<br />at the production design.</i>
2047200 2051285 <i>You see how unique<br />and distinct this family is</i>
2051640 2053563 <i>-and how successful...<br />-GREENSPAN: They've really lived.</i>
2053720 2055370 <i>CUTLER". Yeah, and communicating that.</i>
2055880 2059282 <i>It's a house that doesn't look like<br />anybody else's house in the world.</i>
2059440 2063081 <i>And yet, it feels real.<br />It feels genuine to them.</i>
2063160 2065367 ...to my closet in the morning<br />and go about your life.
2065600 2066681 Baby, it's one night.
2066760 2068569 <i>CUTLER". There isn't a lot in this film</i>
2068640 2072486 <i>that we shot and didn't include<br />in the final cut.</i>
2073120 2076647 <i>I think that Keith Henderson's editor's cut...</i>
2076800 2078211 <i>Keith is our wonderful editor,</i>
2078760 2084449 <i>and his cut didn't have much more in it</i>
2084560 2085641 <i>than is in the film.</i>
2085800 2088246 <i>When they called to say,</i>
2088320 2090402 <i>-for the home video extras...<br />-GREENSPAN: "What are you extras?"</i>
2090480 2093962 <i>CUTLER: "What are your outtakes?"<br />There are only really two scenes,</i>
2094040 2095804 <i>one of which is</i>
2095920 2100403 <i>a scene between Mia and Kim</i>
2101000 2104891 <i>in the hospital chapel,<br />which is a beautiful scene,</i>
2105040 2109728 <i>but it ended up not really fitting in.</i>
2109800 2111086 Oh, I'm good.
2111160 2112685 Okay. Well, it's there if you want it.
2113640 2115642 LIZ: Yo, Adam. We're goin' on.
2115840 2117490 Okay. I've gotta go do my set.
2117640 2119768 No running off with some me wannabe.
2119920 2121126 <i>I'll</i> try. (CHUCKLES)
2123000 2124206 Have fun.
2124400 2126368 Oh, my God, Mia.
2126600 2129285 You look amazing.<br />Did you get this in Seattle?
2129480 2131289 Hey. Wanna bone?
2131480 2132641 MAN: You're frickin' embarrassing yourself.
2132800 2134689 Come on,<br />at least give me your bone number.
2134840 2136444 EMCEE: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Willamette Stone!</i>
2136560 2138244 (CROWD CHEERING)
2142880 2144405 <i>ADAM". Happy Halloween.</i>
2144520 2145726 GIRL; Wh00!
2146760 2148285 - Are you coming?<br />-(MOUTHING)
2148680 2150205 (PLAYING ROCK MUSIC)
2150280 2152248 <i>GREENSPAN: You had the great idea<br />during shooting</i>
2152400 2155404 <i>that we should do a little intro here<br />that would be so much sexier</i>
2155560 2157847 <i>if she were waiting for him,</i>
2158480 2159970 <i>and I just got so excited about that.</i>
2160160 2162925 <i>CUTLER: Well, that...<br />I almost forgot about that.</i>
2163080 2167324 <i>We actually, initially shot Adam<br />coming to the house.</i>
2167400 2168731 <i>GREENSPAN: Right.<br />To set up the whole thing.</i>
2168800 2170689 <i>CUTLER: And he came to the house<br />in his Beethoven outfit,</i>
2170760 2172967 <i>and he had this big Beethoven wig,</i>
2173200 2176249 <i>-and it didn't look very sexy at all.<br />-GREENSPAN: No.</i>
2176440 2179842 <i>CUTLER: it looked, in fact...<br />It was all wrong. It was all wrong.</i>
2179920 2182207 <i>GREENSPAN: Also, her brother was there,<br />and the parents were there.</i>
2182280 2184203 <i>- It was not</i> a <i>hot moment.<br />- CUTLER: We had Teddy there, saying,</i>
2184280 2186044 <i>"Take me out." And her parents were there.</i>
2186160 2188447 <i>At one point,<br />we looked at each other and said,</i>
2188600 2190364 <i>"Why are her parents always around</i>
2190440 2192807 <i>"when the two of these guys<br />are getting together?"</i>
2194240 2196447 <i>So, it occurred to me, we could just jump</i>
2196560 2200451 <i>from that scene with Mom<br />to outside the club.</i>
2201640 2205326 <i>We were gonna do the montage,<br />and then go outside the club.</i>
2205400 2208290 <i>But then we cut the montage and<br />ended up just going outside the club.</i>
2208440 2210090 <i>You see them, and it's so much better.</i>
2210200 2215047 <i>I remember the day I told<br />the costume and hair department</i>
2215280 2217601 <i>that we were gonna lose Adam's wig,</i>
2217680 2218920 <i>-and they were so happy.<br />-(GREENSPAN CHUCKLES)</i>
2219000 2221002 <i>CUTLER: They were so grateful<br />because look how awesome he looks.</i>
2221120 2225091 <i>Imagine him with<br />a two-foot high Beethoven wig.</i>
2225200 2226326 <i>Not so sexy.</i>
2226400 2228721 <i>GREENSPAN: The looks between them<br />here are so great.</i>
2228800 2231485 <i>He sees her dancing and fitting in,</i>
2231600 2236527 <i>and she's worshiping his music<br />and she's having fun.</i>
2236640 2238051 <i>CUTLER: It's another<br />one of my favorite scenes</i>
2238160 2241767 <i>because the whole story<br />is told without dialogue.</i>
2242600 2244762 <i>The whole story is told<br />in those performance moments</i>
2244840 2248765 <i>between the two of them,<br />and they do it beautifully.</i>
2251040 2252041 So...
2253320 2254606 Do you like me like this?
2254680 2256250 <i>CUTLER: Now,<br />this is an interesting moment</i>
2256320 2258482 <i>in the film because it's leading up to</i>
2258760 2262526 <i>a well-known part of Gayle's book</i>
2263440 2267684 <i>that we included in the script<br />and included in the production,</i>
2268160 2272722 <i>but it's the only thing</i>
2273200 2277205 <i>that we changed in the movie<br />after we test-screened the film.</i>
2277280 2278281 GREENSPAN: Mmm-hmm.
2278360 2283241 <i>CUTLER: And for fans of the book,<br />it's the night that</i>
2284040 2288045 <i>Adam and Mia get together<br />for the first time.</i>
2288280 2292171 <i>There is a scene in which they...</i>
2293120 2296727 <i>They play each other like<br />the instruments that they love.</i>
2297960 2302045 <i>He plays her like a guitar.</i>
2302160 2304162 <i>She plays him like a cello.</i>
2304320 2309360 <i>Even as I'm saying it, it sounds like<br />that must be awkward.</i>
2309440 2312205 <i>Um, when you read it in Gayle's book,<br />it's quite beautiful.</i>
2312320 2313651 GREENSPAN: Yeah. You imagine <i>it,</i>
2313720 2316451 <i>and your brain takes you<br />to a place where it works.</i>
2317240 2320244 <i>CUTLER". It's detailed, and it's gentle,</i>
2320320 2325804 <i>but it has a romanticism and an eroticism</i>
2325960 2329043 <i>that feels appropriate for first love.</i>
2329160 2334929 <i>We shot it here in this barn,<br />where Adam says to Mia,</i>
2336600 2338250 <i>"Play me like a cello."</i>
2338440 2342240 <i>And they did a great job with it.</i>
2342600 2346446 <i>But when it screened,</i>
2347320 2348651 <i>the audience laughed.</i>
2348760 2350524 <i>There were nervous titters.</i>
2350600 2351726 <i>And we couldn't quite figure out what.</i>
2351800 2354644 <i>If they were nervous, if it seemed cheesy.</i>
2356840 2361687 <i>Somehow, it didn't quite have<br />the effect that we wanted it to have.</i>
2361800 2363131 <i>It didn't...</i>
2363680 2368811 <i>As a result, really,<br />it wasn't a successful moment.</i>
2369080 2371287 <i>It was the only thing</i>
2371920 2376289 <i>that really was impacted<br />by the test screening,</i>
2376440 2378488 <i>other than the usual things</i> of...
2378600 2381888 <i>Sure, you're going to find out pacing,<br />and tighten up here and there.</i>
2382560 2384767 <i>Some joke might land better or something.</i>
2385200 2386964 <i>Maybe you'll have a different music choice.</i>
2387080 2390402 <i>But the real scene that we changed<br />became this scene,</i>
2390600 2394730 <i>and as a result of the change,</i>
2395680 2398729 <i>Adam no longer says to Mia,<br />"Play me like a cello."</i>
2401760 2405924 <i>But the scene, the content, is still the same.</i>
2406000 2409322 <i>It's the two of them getting together,<br />making love for the first time.</i>
2409600 2413491 <i>GREENSPAN: And she's the right amount<br />of vulnerable and real.</i>
2414320 2417403 <i>CUTLER: And it worked. It's one of<br />those things where you think,</i>
2417480 2420882 <i>"Oh, how can we change this?"<br />We tried losing the scene.</i>
2420960 2422962 <i>Of course, you couldn't do that.<br />That didn't work.</i>
2423040 2425247 <i>GREENSPAN: You have the moment now,<br />just without that line.</i>
2425480 2426925 <i>CUTLER". Exactly. Without that action,</i>
2427000 2430004 <i>without that idea of<br />playing like an instrument,</i>
2430240 2431446 <i>and yet, it still worked.</i>
2432640 2434290 <i>Keith Henderson,</i>
2434360 2437762 <i>our editor, is at his finest<br />in many, many sequences,</i>
2438000 2441049 <i>but this is really one of<br />the great demonstrations of his work.</i>
2443000 2444729 G RE E N S <i>PAN: The intercutting there</i><br /><i>is beautiful.</i>
2444960 2446405 <i>CUTLER". Just beautifully, beautifully done.</i>
2447680 2450445 <i>GREENSPAN: And then we come back to<br />the bleak hospital, after that.</i>
2451920 2456244 <i>CUTLER: Again, you see the distinction<br />in the production design</i>
2456400 2458801 <i>and the palette that...</i>
2458920 2461400 <i>The way the whole film is designed.</i>
2463200 2465680 <i>Transitions were a thing<br />we talked a lot about.</i>
2465760 2468843 <i>Are we going to need<br />really direct transitions</i>
2469040 2470963 <i>that answer the question,</i>
2471040 2475523 <i>"Why does Mia go back and forth<br />in her memory?"</i>
2476240 2479005 <i>I always felt that the emotion<br />would carry the moment,</i>
2479120 2483523 <i>and if the design elements were</i>
2484720 2489521 <i>as we've been discussing,<br />then that would tell the story.</i>
2489680 2491091 <i>And they have.</i>
2493360 2497081 <i>This is a very powerful sequence to me,</i>
2499000 2503608 <i>in that it's the moment where Mia<br />finds out that she's lost her parents.</i>
2506080 2511610 <i>And I've always described<br />this feeling of loss,</i>
2513440 2516728 <i>those of us who have lost a parent<br />know this feeling,</i>
2517080 2522211 <i>of just being lost in suspended space.</i>
2523400 2525402 <i>Sometimes when you're<br />walking down a staircase</i>
2525480 2529451 <i>and you think that there's another step,<br />but there isn't.</i>
2529720 2532326 <i>For a moment, you're just floating in space</i>
2532440 2535205 <i>and you don't know how long it'll go on.<br />If it'll go on forever,</i>
2535800 2538849 <i>and you're just gonna fall, fall, fall.</i>
2539120 2541009 <i>That's how Mia is feeling in this moment.</i>
2541160 2545643 <i>That's what I found it was often like,</i>
2545920 2551290 <i>in the days and weeks and months<br />after losing my dad.</i>
2551440 2555968 <i>Just the sense that it's bottomless.</i>
2558400 2561529 <i>And I said all of that to everybody,</i>
2561600 2564126 <i>whether we were editing,<br />or whether it was Heitor's score,</i>
2564280 2566726 <i>or whether it was the way<br />that John shot that scene,</i>
2566840 2569161 <i>or the way that Chloe performed it.</i>
2569400 2572847 <i>I think it really conveys</i>
2573080 2578086 <i>that sense, only alleviated<br />when she arrives at Teddy's room</i>
2578160 2579525 <i>and sees that he's still alive.</i>
2579720 2581449 <i>GREENSPAN: She has one person left. Yeah.</i>
2583520 2586808 <i>It's funny, I just realized<br />that I read the book for the first time</i>
2586880 2588405 <i>right after I lost my father,</i>
2588560 2592007 <i>and you started this movie<br />right after you lost yours.</i>
2592080 2594208 <i>I'm just realizing that connection now.</i>
2594320 2595685 (CUTLER STAMMERING)
2598000 2600207 <i>CUTLER: It's a movie<br />about children and parents.</i>
2600360 2601850 <i>It's a book about children and parents,</i>
2601960 2606284 <i>in ways that we don't necessarily think of it.</i>
2606440 2610206 <i>But certainly that experience,</i>
2611800 2617443 <i>losing my dad, informed so much<br />of what the movie was about.</i>
2617520 2619887 (WHISPERING) You're mine now, Teddy.
2620360 2622806 <i>CUTLER: So, we get to dedicate this<br />to our dads.</i>
2622880 2625281 <i>GREENSPAN: That's a good idea.<br />-Excellent.</i>
2625360 2626600 We're gonna make it.
2628760 2634210 <i>CUTLER: This is another scene<br />that changed in late script stage.</i>
2634400 2636687 <i>- This was originally a moment...<br />-GREENSPAN: A big speech.</i>
2636760 2639730 <i>...that flashes back in time, remember'?</i>
2639840 2641649 <i>This was Teddy's birth scene.</i>
2642720 2646088 <i>And then we realized,<br />rather than it being a scene where Mia,</i>
2646200 2650888 <i>as a little girl, is watching her mom<br />give birth to her baby brother,</i>
2651080 2652206 <i>it should be</i>
2652360 2655250 <i>grown Mia talking to Teddy<br />in the hospital room,</i>
2655400 2658324 <i>-saying the same things. Exactly.<br />-GREENSPAN: Telling him to live.</i>
2658400 2659561 <i>CUTLER". That was a big change.</i>
2659640 2662769 <i>Before we started shooting,<br />but late in the script process.</i>
2664720 2666768 <i>GREENSPAN". A lot of running in the movie.</i>
2667600 2669967 <i>CUTLER". Yeah. That's how</i>
2670040 2672884 <i>we answered the question of<br />what's going on in the hospital.</i>
2673640 2677964 <i>There's running.<br />There's going through the halls.</i>
2678120 2681283 <i>There's Mia talking to herself.</i>
2681400 2686247 <i>These are the things that<br />distinguish this level of existence,</i>
2686360 2688840 <i>where she's between life and death.</i>
2690080 2692970 <i>GREENSPAN: I think, also,<br />the way the movie is structured,</i>
2693080 2695811 <i>and you did this so cleverly,</i> is...
2697880 2701282 <i>There's a big reveal every so often,</i>
2701400 2704244 <i>and we have these flashbacks,<br />and it keeps people wondering,</i>
2704320 2706971 <i>"What's going to happen next<br />to her in the hospital?"</i>
2707120 2709122 <i>and "What's going to<br />happen next in the love story?"</i>
2709200 2713489 <i>So, it's not all just</i>
2713880 2715484 <i>about her parents dying.</i>
2715840 2718286 <i>Now, we're going to see what happens<br />next in their love story.</i>
2718440 2719771 <i>They're just building,</i>
2719880 2722850 <i>and falling in love,<br />and really coming together.</i>
2723880 2727930 <i>CUTLER: Those still photographs you saw<br />were taken as production stills.</i>
2728040 2730327 <i>No intention to use them in the film.</i>
2730680 2733809 <i>GREENSPAN: Literally next to<br />a garbage can in an alley.</i>
2734000 2736606 <i>CUTLER: Absolutely.<br />But when we were editing</i>
2736680 2740651 <i>and we wanted to tell the story of Adam's<br />band getting more and more successful,</i>
2743440 2747001 <i>Keith and I dug out those old photographs<br />and started using them,</i>
2747160 2749288 <i>and what do you know?<br />They worked. It was great.</i>
2749440 2751204 <i>You get very resourceful.</i>
2751800 2756522 <i>Some things you use every frame of.</i>
2756640 2758802 <i>In one of the memory montages,</i>
2758880 2762202 <i>the footage when Mia is<br />having memories of her family,</i>
2762560 2765086 <i>where they're playing football<br />and they're running around?</i>
2765360 2767886 <i>All of that was taken during camera tests.</i>
2768360 2770966 <i>GREENSPAN: During prep. There was<br />no hair and makeup. They just went for it.</i>
2771080 2774448 <i>CUTLER: There was no intention, ever,<br />of using that footage,</i>
2774520 2776204 <i>and we used every frame of it.</i>
2776600 2778921 <i>Still photographs.<br />No intention, ever, of using it,</i>
2779080 2780161 <i>and we used every photograph.</i>
2780240 2783050 <i>Now, we haven't spoken<br />about Chloé Moretz</i>
2783400 2784811 <i>-and the cello.<br />-GREENSPAN: And the cello.</i>
2784880 2786006 (CUTLER LAUGHING)
2786440 2790240 <i>CUTLER: So, I hope<br />we're not revealing any secrets,</i>
2790360 2793409 <i>but Chloé Moretz is not a cello prodigy.</i>
2793640 2795165 <i>GREENSPAN: She did take lessons before,</i>
2795240 2799768 <i>but was so busy doing<br />four movies before ours,</i>
2800160 2803607 <i>the cello followed her around<br />from Leipzig, Germany,</i>
2803760 2805125 <i>to Switzerland, wherever she was.</i>
2805200 2807646 <i>CUTLER". We just made it our business.<br />GREENSPAN: We would send the cello.</i>
2807720 2809210 <i>CUTLER". Because I was always in a panic</i>
2809280 2812045 <i>that she wasn't spending enough time<br />with a cello,</i>
2812240 2817451 <i>so you approved the costs and we made it<br />our business that, wherever Chloe was,</i>
2817560 2818721 <i>a cello was sure to follow.</i>
2819480 2823246 <i>GREENSPAN: I think she thought there was<br />some stalker in every hotel room.</i>
2823400 2825402 <i>(LAUGHING) Every hotel room,<br />there was</i> a <i>cello in there.</i>
2825560 2831567 <i>CUTLER: We also had our cello teacher<br />available to her on Skype,</i>
2831920 2835811 <i>so that if she would<br />have an extra few hours...</i>
2835960 2838645 <i>This must be the busiest...</i>
2838880 2840086 <i>Chloé was 16 at the time.</i>
2840160 2844802 <i>Must be the most overscheduled,<br />busiest 16-year-old ever,</i>
2845040 2848647 <i>so she rarely had a free couple of hours.</i>
2848760 2851969 <i>But when she did,<br />she could Skype with her cello teacher,</i>
2852080 2854208 <i>and she did start to pick it up.</i>
2854440 2858764 <i>But, nevertheless,<br />it became necessary for us</i>
2858840 2865610 <i>to have somebody else<br />play the cello on film,</i>
2866240 2871724 <i>and for Chloé to also do</i>
2871840 2874207 <i>the physical mannerisms<br />of playing the cello.</i>
2874280 2876760 <i>We would shoot her in close-up,</i>
2876960 2883286 <i>and then we composited Chloé's body<br />with Haigan Day, our cello double's body.</i>
2883520 2888811 <i>Haigan, of course, is in her own right<br />an extraordinary cellist,</i>
2888920 2893608 <i>so the performance of<br />the cello playing is fantastic.</i>
2893800 2896280 <i>The visual effects ended up<br />working beautifully,</i>
2896360 2898283 <i>though there was a fair<br />amount of trial and error.</i>
2898640 2904966 <i>And the thing, I believe,<br />that sold it most of all</i>
2905160 2911725 <i>was that Chloe spent a great deal of time<br />studying videotape of the great cellists.</i>
2912240 2914004 - No. Why?<br />- I don't know.
2914240 2919121 <i>CUTLER: And she communicates<br />the soul of the performance</i>
2919560 2923281 <i>-in her face and her body language.<br />GREENSPAN". And her eyes.</i>
2923360 2925169 <i>CUTLER". Yes. And her eyes.</i>
2925680 2930686 <i>I've heard her speak,<br />while doing interviews about the film,</i>
2930800 2935681 <i>about the feel of the body, the way<br />that you breathe through the cellists.</i>
2935840 2939128 <i>The thing that she noticed most<br />about the great cellists that she studied</i>
2939280 2941521 <i>was that they were breathing with the cello,</i>
2941760 2945731 <i>and that their personalities opened up<br />and emerged as they were playing.</i>
2945880 2947644 <i>She speaks beautifully<br />and articulately about this.</i>
2948560 2951689 <i>But most of all,<br />she communicates it in her performance.</i>
2951880 2954201 <i>This scene is a perfect example.</i>
2954720 2957644 <i>GREENSPAN: She knew this part.<br />This part she could do.</i>
2957720 2959768 <i>CUTLER: Well, this is Haigan.<br />GREENSPAN: Yes, but...</i>
2959840 2961524 <i>CUTLER: And this is Chloé.</i>
2962200 2966046 <i>And you see it, and she's<br />so connected in the moment.</i>
2966880 2971920 <i>Of course, the great place<br />you see it is in the audition.</i>
2972120 2973406 <i>GREENSPAN". The Juilliard audition.</i>
2973480 2975482 <i>CUTLER". At what we called Jolari Hall.</i>
2976400 2979324 <i>But this was not an easy thing to pull off.</i>
2979440 2981761 <i>I was very nervous about it,<br />as you know, Alison,</i>
2981880 2985282 <i>because I would call you<br />in the months before we shot</i>
2985400 2986606 <i>pretty much every day, saying,</i>
2986720 2990088 <i>"How is she gonna learn to play the cello?<br />How are we going to pull it off?"</i>
2990200 2993090 <i>GREENSPAN: And I kept saying,<br />"Don't worry, it'll look great."</i>
2993200 2994406 <i>CUTLER". But what did you really think?</i>
2994480 2996005 - GREENSPAN: I'm not sure.<br />-(BOTH LAUGHING)
2996080 3000847 <i>CUTLER: We pulled it off,<br />and it does work beautifully.</i>
3000960 3004328 <i>And she has a physical relationship<br />with the cello,</i>
3004480 3007211 <i>which is the most important thing<br />that we could've hoped for.</i>
3008600 3012241 <i>Well, now is a perfect time<br />for us to discuss Jakob Davies.</i>
3012400 3014004 <i>GREENSPAN: Teddy.<br />CUTLER". Our Teddy.</i>
3014720 3016722 <i>Another person...<br />When we were talking about casting,</i>
3016800 3019690 <i>we didn't mention Jakob</i>
3019760 3023048 <i>and the importance<br />of finding the perfect Teddy.</i>
3024560 3026164 <i>And I'm a redhead.</i>
3028000 3032608 <i>I want to clarify that I did not insist</i>
3033520 3037047 <i>that Mia's mom be a redhead, and I did not<br />insist that her brother be a redhead.</i>
3037120 3038724 <i>GREENSPAN: It just so happens.<br />-But I'm delighted that</i>
3038800 3040006 <i>it worked out that way.</i>
3041880 3044281 <i>But, boy, Jakob came in to audition.</i>
3044440 3048650 <i>He was adorable.<br />He was real. He was funny.</i>
3048800 3049847 <i>He improv-ed.</i>
3050720 3054725 <i>He had an instinct for the drums,<br />and then took some drumming lessons</i>
3055040 3057725 <i>-'cause he had to...<br />- GREENSPAN: Very studious about that.</i>
3057840 3059171 <i>CUTLER: He was very studious,</i>
3059240 3063529 <i>and he was a great presence on the set.</i>
3063840 3066650 <i>And then, on his final day of shooting,</i>
3067000 3070322 <i>he made a little drum kit for everybody,</i>
3070440 3072727 <i>and he gave them all to us<br />with a thank you note.</i>
3072920 3074524 <i>He's just a great kid.</i>
3074640 3077883 <i>But if your heart doesn't go out to Teddy,</i>
3078080 3082688 <i>if you aren't in love with that kid,<br />then the movie isn't the movie.</i>
3082840 3084683 If I Stay <i>isn't</i> If I Stay.
3084800 3087326 <i>It's hard not to be in love</i>
3087400 3089323 <i>with the Teddy<br />that Jakob Davies performed.</i>
3089440 3091522 <i>GREENSPAN: He's a delicious kid.</i>
3092000 3093001 <i>CUTLER". A delicious kid.</i>
3093080 3094764 <i>- GREENSPAN: Delicious kid-<br />-(CUTLER CHUCKLES)</i>
3094840 3096205 Speaking of the devil.
3096840 3097841 Hello?
3098000 3099411 - Hey, babe.<br />-(CROWD CLAMORING)
3099480 3101881 <i>CUTLER: This is another scene that<br />there was some discussion about,</i>
3101960 3104566 <i>some debate about whether<br />we should have this sequence.</i>
3104880 3110171 <i>I felt very strongly that we should</i>
3110840 3115448 <i>because I felt it was important<br />not only to see Adam having success</i>
3116080 3118208 <i>outside of Mia, but to see them separate.</i>
3118280 3121727 <i>This is actually the only time<br />the two of them are not together,</i>
3121840 3124241 <i>once they become boyfriend and girlfriend.</i>
3124640 3126165 <i>You need to have a moment</i>
3126840 3131243 <i>where their relationship</i>
3131360 3135046 <i>-is under stress prior to...<br />GREENSPAN: There's conflict. Yeah.</i>
3135200 3137771 <i>CUTLER: Here, they're not together,<br />but she's just getting the letter</i>
3137960 3141487 <i>that's gonna inform them.<br />But you need to see them apart</i>
3141560 3142641 <i>in the same scene.</i>
3142760 3145491 <i>You need to see that<br />something is threatening them.</i>
3146280 3151650 <i>Not an infidelity or anything, except that<br />they're both having so much success.</i>
3151720 3153848 <i>In this sequence now, you see that.</i>
3153960 3156770 <i>He's succeeding by getting</i> a...
3156880 3158848 <i>There's a record label<br />that wants to sign him.</i>
3158920 3161207 <i>She's succeeding by getting into Juilliard.</i>
3161280 3165171 <i>They are both just being themselves,<br />their truest selves.</i>
3165240 3167481 <i>They're becoming their truest selves,</i>
3167600 3170843 <i>and yet, there's immediately a sense<br />that this is going to tear them apart.</i>
3170920 3173730 <i>So, that was a very important sequence<br />in the film.</i>
3173800 3176849 <i>GREENSPAN: You always said<br />that music is tearing them apart.</i>
3176920 3180367 <i>It's not anything they're doing.<br />He doesn't cheat on her.</i>
3180440 3182249 <i>He doesn't become a jerk all of a sudden.</i>
3182320 3185369 <i>It's that they are both having success<br />at what they love.</i>
3185440 3190241 <i>CUTLER: Yeah, I think that's a really<br />distinguishing quality of this story,</i>
3190320 3191401 <i>of Gayle's story,</i>
3191480 3197089 <i>is that the heartbreak in this film<br />is not because either of them are...</i>
3197160 3202246 <i>Do stupid things the way teenagers do,<br />or we all do.</i>
3202320 3206370 <i>This relationship is being torn apart</i>
3206440 3209967 <i>by the two of them being their truest selves.</i>
3210040 3213123 <i>And that's the tragedy.<br />That's what's so difficult,</i>
3213200 3217125 <i>because if they could find a way<br />to be themselves</i>
3217200 3220363 <i>and be together, of course<br />that's what both of them would want.</i>
3220680 3222330 I applied to Juilliard.

3228960 3230086 (GREENSPAN LAUGHS)
3230160 3232242 <i>CUTLER: And yet, you don't know. Right?<br />GREENSPAN: No.</i>
3232320 3233321 <i>Very good sound mix.</i>
3233400 3236449 <i>CUTLER: That's why you hear those crickets<br />in the background. That's covering rain.</i>
3236520 3238488 <i>Isn't that amazing? That's a sound thing.</i>
3239160 3241561 <i>Here... Just watch for a moment</i>
3241640 3243085 <i>'cause this really is that beautiful scene</i>
3243160 3245527 <i>where they're both realizing<br />what's going on.</i>
3246000 3247809 In San Francisco.
3249040 3250041 Wow.
3251000 3252047 Wow.
3252320 3254129 Juilliard. Mia, that's...
3255000 3256684 Way to go. That's cool.
3257640 3259563 Yeah, well, I won't get in.
3259960 3263009 But it's kind of a big deal<br />that I even got an audition.
3263640 3265608 Most people don't.
3267520 3270285 Well, Yo Mama better<br />watch his back. Right?
3270360 3273921 <i>GREENSPAN: He's trying so hard<br />to be supportive. You just love him.</i>
3274400 3276971 <i>But his heart's breaking.</i>
3279000 3281765 <i>CUTLER: One of the fun things<br />we got to do with Adam's band</i>
3281880 3284565 <i>was show the arc of their growth,</i>
3284640 3288690 <i>their success, over the year-and-a-half<br />that the film takes place.</i>
3288760 3289841 <i>GREENSPAN: Here, they've made it.</i>
3289920 3292287 <i>CUTLER: And here they are having... Yeah.<br />At the peak.</i>
3292360 3295523 <i>And that's why we get<br />that beautiful spotlight shot</i>
3296360 3297600 <i>of the marquee.</i>
3297680 3299205 <i>GREENSPAN: We went to<br />a concert here, in prep.</i>
3299280 3301806 <i>- CUTLER: We did.<br />- This is how you loved that location.</i>
3301880 3303928 <i>CUTLER". That's right. We saw, uh...</i>
3306560 3308244 <i>GREENSPAN: Kurt Vile.<br />CUTLER: Kurt Vile</i>
3308320 3313884 <i>and, coincidentally,<br />the opening act was Johnny de Courcy,</i>
3313960 3317407 <i>who was the young son</i>
3319840 3324004 <i>of the homeowners of the house<br />that we shot. The Hall family.</i>
3324080 3326128 <i>GREENSPAN". That was a weird coincidence.</i>
3326200 3327964 <i>CUTLER". It was a remarkable coincidence.</i>
3328920 3331127 <i>And this shot, I loved.</i>
3331200 3335489 <i>Seeing the sea of people<br />and their hands up in the air. I just love it.</i>
3335600 3338251 <i>And then this-<br />And that is pure John de Barman.</i>
3339280 3342045 <i>Beautiful button on the performance.</i>
3342400 3343401 <i>Just terrific.</i>
3344760 3346444 ADAM: Thanks. Thanks for coming.
3346600 3347647 Did you like the show?
3347760 3348807 Good.
3348880 3352521 <i>CUTLER: We're now getting towards<br />the scene that is their big fight scene.</i>
3352600 3354250 <i>The big breakup scene.</i>
3356680 3360127 <i>And this was, of course,</i>
3360200 3363568 <i>the roughest scene<br />between them in the film.</i>
3364000 3368050 <i>The scenes in the hospital are very,<br />very emotional and there is great loss,</i>
3368120 3371602 <i>but in terms of the story</i>
3371720 3375520 <i>that takes place in the past<br />about Mia and Adam's relationship,</i>
3375640 3377244 <i>this fight scene is the raw scene.</i>
3377320 3381484 <i>It's the only scene<br />that we shot fully handheld.</i>
3381560 3386726 <i>- It's shot as if it were a vérité documentary.<br />-GREENSPAN: Raw and rough.</i>
3386800 3390885 <i>CUTLER". It's raw and rough<br />and shot handheld,</i>
3390960 3394726 <i>and you feel that rawness as a result.</i>
3397680 3399728 <i>GREENSPAN: It's that scene,<br />or that moment in life,</i>
3399800 3402644 <i>where you just say things and go too far.</i>
3403800 3405290 <i>I don't know if you feel this way,</i>
3405360 3409160 <i>but it seems like<br />they never really 100% recover</i>
3409240 3411242 <i>from some of the stuff that was said.</i>
3412280 3413441 <i>It's hard to take it back.</i>
3413520 3415045 <i>CUTLER: It's always hard to<br />take things back.</i>
3415120 3418363 <i>That's one of things you learn<br />as you get older, is that...</i>
3418440 3422001 <i>Especially in moments like this,<br />you gotta be careful what you say</i>
3422640 3425291 <i>because it's hard to put<br />the genie back in the bottle.</i>
3427360 3431331 <i>In the same way<br />that Adam and Mia experience first love,</i>
3431400 3437760 <i>they also are experiencing first cruelty<br />and that first raw fight.</i>
3439840 3446610 <i>But, again, whenever I watch this,<br />I'm so thrilled with the performance,</i>
3446680 3450844 <i>and the camerawork that gets inside here.</i>
3450920 3453287 <i>And then, of course,<br />the way that Keith cut it.</i>
3453360 3458082 <i>This is another example<br />of everybody operating.</i>
3458160 3462210 <i>The full team operating on all cylinders.</i>
3463720 3466963 <i>I can watch it over and I can watch it<br />a thousand times, this scene.</i>
3467040 3468485 <i>GREENSPAN'. They both really let it rip.</i>
3468560 3469891 We had plans.
3469960 3471724 One minute, it's one thing.<br />The next minute, it's the other.
3471880 3474850 I grew up with that shit, okay?<br />I don't need it.
3476040 3479886 Even if I do go to Juilliard,<br />we can figure it out.
3480000 3482082 Baby, we can text and we can Skype...
3482240 3483526 Skype? Skype?
3483680 3486524 Jesus, Mia! Have you ever even had<br />a long-distance relationship?
3486600 3488090 It's bullshit.
3488160 3491004 Okay? It's like dating a ghost.
3491240 3496371 <i>GREENSPAN: if anything, this is Adam's<br />big crime in the film, is that</i>
3498760 3501206 <i>he is shortsighted, as we all are.</i>
3501280 3503647 <i>We don't think<br />that maybe the next moment,</i>
3503720 3506929 <i>some accident is going to happen<br />and take the love of our life</i> away.
3507880 3512044 <i>He comes to realize he should<br />not have let her go, in this instance.</i>
3512120 3513121 <i>CUTLER". It's true.</i>
3513200 3517524 <i>And yet, I feel that one of the great things<br />Jamie does in his performance</i>
3517600 3522891 <i>is create an Adam, who you understand<br />when he says, "I had that shit growing up."</i>
3522960 3528171 <i>And then, in the make-up scene<br />that's coming up in about three minutes,</i>
3529640 3535522 <i>when he explains himself,<br />you really believe it, and you feel for him</i>
3535600 3539764 <i>'cause he's feeling like the rug<br />is being pulled out from under him,</i>
3539840 3541410 <i>and it's</i>
3541800 3543165 heartbreaking.
3543280 3546124 <i>Boy, did Beck come through for us.</i>
3547120 3550841 <i>A principal collaborator is Beck.</i>
3550920 3554720 <i>This song that covers the montage<br />is so important,</i>
3554800 3557406 <i>and this shot, to me,</i>
3557480 3563010 <i>if I have to pick a favorite shot<br />in the whole film, this is it.</i>
3563120 3567967 <i>Because what we don't realize as we're<br />watching this is that the camera is Mia.</i>
3568040 3570486 <i>We have no idea.<br />We haven't seen her in this scene.</i>
3570560 3572210 <i>We're back in the hospital.</i>
3573600 3576444 <i>Everybody is getting<br />an update on her status.</i>
3576520 3580889 <i>Maybe she'll pull through.<br />She seems to be stable.</i>
3581480 3584723 <i>We still don't know that it's Mia.<br />Adam has to leave.</i>
3586360 3588089 <i>- And then we see that it's Mia.<br />-GREENSPAN: Revealed.</i>
3588160 3593087 <i>CUTLER: And it's a reveal. I find it<br />so moving and beautifully done,</i>
3593160 3597484 <i>and then it takes us back into her memory,<br />and here, again, is Beck,</i>
3597560 3599608 <i>who guides us through this montage.</i>
3599680 3602445 <i>And, boy, we were really fortunate.</i>
3602520 3606764 <i>We got this song in post-production<br />before the album was released.</i>
3606840 3608330 <i>GREENSPAN: We got it on the album.</i>
3608400 3610846 <i>CUTLER: And then, of course,<br />it's on our soundtrack.</i>
3610960 3614601 <i>But we received it<br />before Beck's album was released,</i>
3614680 3621529 <i>and we tried a hundred different songs<br />at that moment in the film.</i>
3621600 3624444 <i>And then Beck's album came in,<br />we put it there,</i>
3624520 3627091 <i>and the moment we heard it,<br />we knew it</i> was...
3627160 3629447 <i>If we could get the rights to it,<br />it would stay forever.</i>
3629560 3632370 <i>And we got the rights to it,<br />which was terrific.</i>
3634040 3635724 When are we gonna open presents?
3635880 3637211 - Mia?<br />- KAT: That's gonna be fun!
3637400 3639880 - Yeah, you wanna do that?<br />- Yeah, sure.
3642520 3645729 <i>CUTLER". It's a heartbreak montage,</i>
3645800 3648326 <i>but it also has to propel the story forward,</i>
3648400 3651882 <i>so all of these little scenes<br />really made a difference.</i>
3653040 3654201 <i>GREENSPAN: You love this shot.</i>
3654280 3655691 <i>CUTLER: (LAUGHING) I do love this shot.</i>
3656760 3659001 <i>I</i> do. (STAMMERING)
3660600 3663171 <i>It was the first shot I saw in dailies</i>
3663240 3665925 <i>where I thought, "Oh, yeah,<br />we're getting the look that we want."</i>
3666000 3668765 <i>- Look at the color. It's just crazy.<br />-GREENSPAN: Beautiful.</i>
3669920 3671763 <i>CUTLER: And Brent Thomas,<br />our production designer,</i>
3671840 3675640 <i>would point out<br />that purple door at the center</i>
3675720 3678564 <i>-indicates death and change.<br />- GREENSPAN: That's his death door.</i>
3678640 3682008 <i>CUTLER: It was central<br />to his design of the house.</i>
3685640 3688371 <i>See? This make-up scene is...</i>
3688440 3691569 <i>The performance of this<br />is as important as the fight itself.</i>
3692600 3695444 <i>When Adam explains himself, it's so critical.</i>
3699480 3702882 <i>First time that this was put up,</i>
3702960 3705611 <i>Adam's mosaic was put up on the ceiling,</i>
3705720 3710806 <i>they did it very...<br />It was perfect, and I said to Brent,</i>
3710880 3716728 <i>"What would it look like<br />if an 18-year-old guy had put it up there?"</i>
3716800 3719531 <i>And that's when all of the<br />masking tape came in, and the thumbtacks,</i>
3719600 3721364 <i>and it got all crooked.</i>
3721440 3724091 <i>He was like,<br />"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right."</i>
3724800 3726609 What do you want, Adam?
3728320 3729367 Mia, I'm sorry.
3729520 3732171 - I know, I suck.<br />- No, no.
3732320 3734607 You can't just disappear<br />from my life like that
3734760 3736524 and pop back into it<br />whenever you feel like it.
3736680 3738489 I know. It's just,
3738640 3741883 the people in my life<br />have a habit of disappearing on me
3742040 3743451 and when you started making plans...
3743520 3744567 You're not gonna lose me.
3744640 3745641 CUTLER: <i>There</i> you go.
3747280 3750250 <i>So, that's what wins you over with Adam.<br />Which is beautiful.</i>
3750320 3753642 <i>Now, we have another scene coming up,<br />which is their make-up...</i>
3753720 3758089 <i>After they make up, it's the scene...</i>
3759200 3762522 <i>They make up, they kiss, they go to bed,</i>
3762600 3764887 <i>and we're with them after they went to bed.</i>
3764960 3769568 <i>This was a scene that you're about to see,</i>
3769640 3772246 <i>that we shot on the final day of production</i>
3772320 3775449 <i>and was written<br />during the final days of production.</i>
3775520 3780560 <i>It was written at the encouragement<br />of Jon Littman, our dear friend.</i>
3782000 3784207 It's a cello and a guitar.
3784880 3786405 Do you get it?
3790200 3792726 <i>CUTLER". He kept on saying,</i>
3792800 3795644 <i>"You need to see these guys getting deeper.</i>
3795720 3797961 <i>"You need to see<br />that relationship getting deeper."</i>
3798040 3801283 <i>And we shot it<br />not knowing where it would go.</i>
3801400 3804324 <i>We all thought, and, in fact...</i>
3804400 3806767 <i>When you make a movie,<br />you number the script</i>
3806840 3810811 <i>and you number the scenes,<br />and we gave it a much earlier number</i>
3810880 3814441 <i>because we all thought<br />it would come much closer to that scene</i>
3814520 3820721 <i>where they first make love in the barn.</i>
3823240 3824730 <i>Here's the scene.</i>
3824840 3827844 <i>But it was Keith Henderson,<br />our editor, who said,</i>
3827920 3830810 <i>"No, no, no. It's gotta go after they make up.</i>
3830880 3832882 <i>"Because if it goes after they make up,</i>
3832960 3835770 <i>"then you feel<br />they have really come back together,</i>
3836080 3840688 <i>"and then you're really<br />deeply invested in the relationship."</i>
3840760 3844048 <i>Because it's only here now,<br />it's only after they've been together,</i>
3844120 3846361 <i>and they've broken up,<br />and they've come back together,</i>
3846440 3848807 <i>that Adam can tell this story about his dad.</i>
3850280 3852203 <i>GREENSPAN: This, actually,<br />we shot in the hospital.</i>
3852280 3855682 <i>We built a little bedroom set<br />in the hospital. You would never know.</i>
3855760 3857524 <i>CUTLER". On the final day.</i>
3859040 3860963 And I realize it's him.
3862520 3864249 It's my old man.
3866120 3867531 And I just
3867800 3869325 stop cold.
3871840 3873888 And he just looks right at me
3874480 3876005 and walks out.
3877040 3878804 No idea who I was.
3881640 3883005 Shit, Adam.
3884120 3887727 Then that night, I played like I was on fire.
3887800 3890644 I don't know if I thought I was good.
3890720 3893326 I just knew that nothing else mattered.
3894720 3896449 Till now.
3896520 3897931 Till you.
3901720 3903722 (BREATH ES DEEPLY)
3909560 3911085 When I play...
3912280 3915124 <i>CUTLER: This is equally important<br />to the scene,</i>
3916680 3919047 <i>her opening up to him.</i>
3919200 3921680 -It's like my little house.<br />- Really?
3925680 3928889 Actually, no.<br />I'm totallyjust in it for the guys.
3929720 3932564 <i>CUTLER: Then, of course,<br />because they're kids, they have to cover.</i>
3932920 3934763 <i>GREENSPAN: Can't get too sappy.</i>
3934840 3935841 Yeah.
3937560 3939085 CUTLER: But really just beautiful,
3939480 3941084 <i>and a beautiful addition, and Jon was right.</i>
3941160 3942207 GREENSPAN: Jon was right.
3942280 3946524 <i>CUTLER: We needed that scene,<br />and thank goodness, Shauna...</i>
3946600 3949888 <i>There were many drafts of it. Many drafts.</i>
3949960 3952088 <i>Back and forth, back and forth,<br />back and forth,</i>
3952160 3955403 <i>and then finally, the day before,<br />we settled on the scene.</i>
3955480 3959804 <i>It's a beautifully written scene,<br />a beautifully performed scene.</i>
3963240 3966244 <i>In post-production,<br />we found the perfect place for it.</i>
3966360 3968601 <i>GREENSPAN: It all worked out.<br />CUTLER". Yeah, really nice.</i>
3968680 3970887 <i>Really nice, the way<br />sometimes that happens.</i>
3971760 3976243 <i>We're now getting ready for Mia's audition.</i>
3978520 3983481 <i>By the way, this voiceover here is actually...</i>
3983560 3985847 <i>In the book, is the prologue.</i>
3985960 3991205 <i>It's the very first page of the book,<br />is this interior monologue from Mia,</i>
3993280 3998571 <i>where she says the decision<br />is so terrifying to her.</i>
3999560 4002006 <i>GREENSPAN: It's her choice,<br />and she has the power to make it.</i>
4002080 4004048 <i>She really struggles with that power.</i>
4005120 4008442 <i>CUTLER: In the movie,<br />we decided to put it there,</i>
4008520 4011524 <i>and have that lead us<br />right into her Juilliard audition.</i>
4011600 4014410 <i>This is the place where I think, really,</i>
4014480 4018007 <i>if Chloé hadn't spent<br />all that time with the cello,</i>
4018080 4021129 <i>if she hadn't studied the great cellists,</i>
4023680 4027890 <i>if she hadn't been able to<br />really communicate that,</i>
4028000 4029809 <i>you wouldn't get the sense,</i>
4029920 4032287 <i>and this is so important to this film,</i>
4032960 4037045 <i>that young Mia is having,<br />for perhaps the first time in her life,</i>
4037120 4040090 <i>a moment of artistic transcendence,</i>
4040440 4042647 <i>where she is...</i>
4043440 4044851 <i>The art she is creating</i>
4044920 4048242 <i>is larger than anything<br />she can even comprehend,</i>
4048320 4050971 <i>and it's a bit of magic.</i>
4052000 4054048 <i>GREENSPAN: She says<br />she doesn't know she had it in her.</i>
4054120 4057283 <i>That's what I always think of here.</i>
4057760 4059649 (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
4085200 4087771 <i>CUTLER: This is, of course, also the moment</i>
4087840 4089763 <i>where we really meet Gramps.</i>
4090320 4091924 <i>We have seen him,</i>
4092000 4096244 <i>but we're now meeting a man<br />who's going through a transformation,</i>
4096360 4100684 <i>so affected is he<br />by the music his granddaughter is creating.</i>
4112360 4114283 <i>We always say,</i>
4114720 4117803 <i>"How do you know<br />the king has walked in the room?"</i>
4117880 4120087 <i>The answer is, "Because everybody bows."</i>
4120160 4122128 <i>How do you know Mia's this great?</i>
4122840 4124171 <i>Because Gramps cries.</i>
4126160 4127161 (some ENDS)
4127760 4128761 (PANTING)
4129640 4131244 <i>GREENSPAN". I love that look she gives.</i>
4132360 4133441 <i>CUTLER: Can't believe it.</i>
4135720 4140567 <i>So, that's an exciting moment in the film.</i>
4140640 4142768 <i>With this shot, which is an unusual shot,</i>
4142840 4146447 <i>'cause you don't see the reverse on Mia</i>
4146520 4149330 <i>because we actually never got to shoot it.</i>
4149400 4153485 <i>But we kept that shot in because<br />it's Mia's point of view of the house</i>
4153560 4156131 <i>after that moment,<br />and she's seeing it differently.</i>
4157440 4158805 <i>She's growing up now.</i>
4159320 4161891 <i>GREENSPAN: You've been out in the world,<br />and you've done this great thing.</i>
4161960 4164008 <i>CUTLER". She is Mia the great cellist now.</i>
4164080 4168927 <i>Everything has changed, and that's why<br />it was important to have that shot,</i>
4169000 4170923 <i>just that point of view,<br />and that was something</i>
4171000 4173207 <i>that was in Shauna's script<br />from the very beginning.</i>
4173280 4176329 <i>She sees the house in</i> a <i>different</i> way.
4177400 4178401 Mia.
4179240 4182687 <i>CUTLER: We talk a lot about<br />the scene of Gramps in the hospital,</i>
4182760 4185366 <i>and we'll talk to it when we get to it<br />because it's such a powerful scene,</i>
4185440 4187363 <i>but I am absolutely certain</i>
4187440 4190967 <i>that the impact of that scene<br />comes because of this scene,</i>
4191080 4194368 <i>because he opens up to her in this way</i>
4194440 4199446 <i>and says, "I want to tell you<br />what I didn't tell your dad."</i>
4201520 4203045 Thank you, Gramps.
4206400 4209882 <i>CUTLER: This is something<br />he could not have done a day ago.</i>
4210960 4212564 <i>GREENSPAN: Yeah, it's an interesting thing.</i>
4212640 4216645 <i>It goes back to just carving real characters.</i>
4216720 4220202 <i>He's not the perfect father or grandfather,</i>
4220320 4223802 <i>and he has a change throughout<br />the movie that really wins you over.</i>
4224000 4226844 <i>CUTLER". I did an interview earlier today.</i>
4226920 4229446 <i>A journalist is doing a piece<br />on tearjerker films,</i>
4229520 4231921 <i>and he was like...<br />He said, "So, what's the secret?</i>
4232040 4237251 <i>"What's the sugar in the spaghetti sauce<br />of tearjerker films?"</i>
4237320 4242167 <i>And we talked about several moments,<br />including that scene with Gramps.</i>
4242240 4244641 <i>And I kept on saying,</i>
4244760 4248242 <i>"I think the secret is that<br />you keep it as real as possible.</i>
4248320 4251642 <i>"If the moments are authentic,<br />and the people are genuine,</i>
4251720 4253404 <i>"and they're in that moment,</i>
4253480 4256131 <i>"and they're being as real as possible,</i>
4256200 4257770 <i>"it's going to be moving."</i>
4257840 4260161 <i>Because a moment like that,</i>
4260240 4263722 <i>where a grandfather<br />opens up to his granddaughter that way</i>
4263800 4265962 <i>and says, "I don't want to<br />make the same mistake with you</i>
4266040 4267963 <i>"that I made with your dad."</i>
4268040 4271169 <i>If it's performed by somebody<br />as brilliant as Stacy,</i>
4271240 4275131 <i>and as brilliant as Chloé, and it's real,</i>
4275200 4276611 <i>-it's gonna be moving.<br />GREENSPAN". It really works.</i>
4276680 4277806 <i>CUTLER". It's gonna jerk the tears.</i>
4277880 4279609 That was a really beautiful song, Adam.
4279680 4281205 It's gettin' there.
4282200 4285124 <i>CUTLER: By the way, that song<br />that we just had Adam play,</i>
4285200 4287726 <i>that was a late addition.</i>
4287800 4293091 <i>Originally, we were going to<br />do that song as an electric song.</i>
4293160 4295367 <i>- It was a slower, more of a ballad.<br />-GREENSPAN: In the club, yeah.</i>
4295440 4297363 <i>CUTLER". We prepared as an electric song.</i>
4297480 4300211 <i>Even in here, he was gonna play it electric,</i>
4300280 4302601 <i>and when we got here that day,</i>
4302680 4307447 <i>Jamie was just fooling around on the<br />acoustic guitar, and it sounded so great,</i>
4307520 4310649 <i>and it was so different<br />than everything else he had done</i>
4310720 4312529 <i>that we figured, let's do it that way.</i>
4312600 4318004 <i>Let's hear a whole different song<br />from Adam Wilde,</i>
4318080 4320048 <i>and a whole different tone.</i>
4320120 4323727 <i>We ended up using that song<br />in the closing credits, we loved it so much.</i>
4324840 4326330 Yeah, me too.
4328320 4331005 You know, for once, I actually felt
4331760 4333569 like I could do this.
4335760 4339481 Why didn't you call me<br />after the audition to brag?
4339600 4340840 I know...
4340920 4342922 <i>CUTLER: Now, you and I<br />discussed this scene</i>
4343000 4344206 -a <i>great deal.<br />- GREENSPAN: Many times.</i>
4344280 4345611 (GREENSPAN CHUCKLING)
4346880 4348848 <i>CUTLER". My feeling is less is more.</i>
4348920 4350843 GREENSPAN: Yes. You were right.
4351280 4352850 (COMMENTATORS LAUGHING)
4352920 4358131 <i>CUTLER: It's not the only reason<br />I bring it up, but I do really love...</i>
4359280 4360691 <i>GREENSPAN: How a look says so much.</i>
4360760 4361807 - CUTLER: Yes.<br />- Yeah.
4361880 4363120 <i>CUTLER". And this pause here.</i>
4363960 4366884 <i>And how painful that is,<br />and then how later in the night,</i>
4366960 4371284 <i>they just are trying and<br />trying to put a laugh on it.</i>
4371360 4373124 <i>Trying to make the best out of it.</i>
4373200 4378161 <i>GREENSPAN: You said and you pointed out<br />that Gayle had this great line in the book,</i>
4378240 4380049 <i>"It's like we were breaking up<br />in slow-motion. "</i>
4380120 4381326 <i>CUTLER: Mmm-hmm.<br />GREENSPAN: And so, you wanted to</i>
4381400 4383164 <i>capture that rolling...</i>
4384040 4386042 <i>How people really break up.</i>
4386120 4387565 <i>You love someone.</i>
4387640 4389881 <i>You know where it's headed,<br />but you can't let go,</i>
4389960 4392361 <i>and you're trying to pretend.<br />This is that scene.</i>
4392440 4394807 <i>CUTLER". Trying so hard. So hard.</i>
4394880 4397884 <i>And she got it, too. Chloé got it.</i>
4397960 4400611 <i>Again, talk about a look in a scene,</i>
4401600 4405047 <i>the final moment of this scene,<br />right before she kisses him,</i>
4405120 4407851 <i>and then when she runs out,<br />really captures that.</i>
4409880 4412645 Okay? And I'm still crazy in love with you.
4414680 4416409 Yeah, me too.
4422160 4423400 <i>CUTLER". Just beautiful.</i>
4430360 4433170 <i>And now we're in the final run of the film.</i>
4434000 4435206 Um...
4436000 4438844 <i>Because you see<br />where the relationship is going.</i>
4440600 4443809 <i>We're about to find out<br />the real emotional blow,</i>
4444720 4446290 <i>which is...</i>
4446360 4450046 <i>We're building up to that of point<br />where we find out about Teddy.</i>
4450120 4453010 <i>This is the hospital section that begins that.</i>
4453080 4456129 <i>Now, I can't remember all of the places</i>
4456200 4458646 <i>we thought about shooting this scene.</i>
4458720 4460051 And finally...
4460120 4461804 <i>GREENSPAN: I was just gonna say,<br />we found this</i>
4461880 4463723 <i>(LAUGHING)</i> a <i>week<br />before we shot this scene.</i>
4463800 4467850 <i>CUTLER: A week is much longer.<br />It may have been the day before.</i>
4467920 4469922 <i>GREENSPAN: Was it that close?<br />CUTLER". Yes.</i>
4471040 4473486 <i>But it was a space that Brent found<br />that worked perfectly</i>
4473560 4476040 <i>-as the hospital roof.<br />- GREENSPAN: Totally worked. Beautiful.</i>
4476800 4480122 <i>CUTLER: And gave us a different look<br />and a different feel.</i>
4480200 4482362 <i>But it was another example<br />of a happy accident,</i>
4483400 4487041 <i>where we were running out of options.</i>
4487120 4490249 <i>I think we were looking at this<br />for the New Year's Eve party, in fact.</i>
4490320 4491321 GREENSPAN: Yes.
4491400 4493641 <i>CUTLER: It was scouted<br />for the New Year's Eve party,</i>
4493720 4495609 <i>and it didn't work<br />for the New Year's Eve party</i>
4495720 4501682 <i>'cause it didn't really feel like it would be<br />a twenty-something's apartment.</i>
4502000 4505209 <i>But Brent came back one day<br />to production and he said,</i>
4505280 4508363 <i>"I think I found the hospital roof.<br />We can do the scene there."</i>
4511400 4514529 <i>When you have a happy accident,<br />it's a good idea to grab it.</i>
4516400 4518084 <i>GREENSPAN: Speaking of happy accidents,</i>
4518200 4522410 <i>we would not have<br />gotten through this crazy schedule,</i>
4522480 4525484 <i>'cause there were basically<br />two Mias working every day,</i>
4525560 4529724 <i>the Mia you see walking around as a ghost<br />and the Mia you see lying in bed.</i>
4529800 4534203 <i>We were really lucky to find a girl<br />whose height and face</i>
4534280 4537523 <i>and body looked exactly like Chloé,</i>
4537600 4541161 <i>and that helped us get through<br />all of these hospital scenes</i>
4541240 4545211 <i>without having to shoot the actual Chloé<br />twice in two locations.</i>
4545280 4547328 We really need someone<br />down there right now!
4547400 4548731 - Shi't!<br />-(WHISPERS) Go!
4548960 4549961 <i>GREENSPAN". That's funny to me every time.</i>
4550040 4551405 <i>CUTLER: (CHUCKLING)<br />I love Liana in the moment.</i>
4551480 4553767 <i>It's so important in this film,</i>
4553840 4556650 <i>it actually brings up an interesting thing,</i>
4556720 4559724 <i>that we were able to find moments of levity.</i>
4559800 4563043 <i>Moments that the audience could laugh,</i>
4563160 4565640 <i>even in the middle<br />of the most intense moments.</i>
4566680 4571527 <i>But this is what you're talking about,<br />where you see both Chloé and the double.</i>
4571600 4574683 <i>Of course, we put Chloé's face<br />on the double using visual effects,</i>
4574760 4578242 <i>but it was great to have<br />that body there to work with.</i>
4579640 4582883 <i>GREENSPAN: That was your conceit<br />of being able to see</i>
4582960 4584405 <i>two Chloés at the same time.</i>
4584480 4585925 <i>CUTLER: So important. You gotta.</i>
4586000 4590324 <i>Mia had to see herself,<br />and it's so powerful when she does.</i>
4590720 4592006 ...handle it from here.
4592080 4594765 <i>CUTLER: Again, here, you see<br />that floating camera that we used,</i>
4594840 4597730 <i>that's Mia's point of view.</i>
4597800 4599529 <i>This is actually the scene...</i>
4599600 4602604 <i>Shooting this scene was<br />where we realized that,</i>
4602680 4606651 <i>that floating camera<br />was going to be so helpful to us.</i>
4606960 4609361 Well, she's gonna need you now<br />more than ever.
4612080 4613570 Hey, what's going on?
4614640 4616449 Willow, what's happening?
4617000 4621722 <i>CUTLER: And this, of course,<br />is the most powerful emotional sequence,</i>
4621800 4626044 <i>when Mia realizes<br />what's happened to Teddy.</i>
4633040 4638046 <i>We've neglected to mention, of course,<br />Gabrielle Rose, who plays Gran.</i>
4638120 4640885 <i>Another wonderful member<br />of this ensemble</i>
4642880 4644848 <i>who had few words to work with,</i>
4644920 4648686 <i>but delivered<br />just another knockout performance.</i>
4651040 4653805 <i>Here is that memory footage<br />we were talking about before.</i>
4655800 4657643 <i>MIA: And never learn to drive.</i>
4658640 4662486 <i>CUTLER". The interaction<br />of editorial and narrative,</i>
4662560 4664528 <i>the way this material was shot,</i>
4666560 4671282 <i>performance, another example<br />of all of it working together</i>
4673080 4679611 <i>at the same time, and you get<br />this feeling that Mia has given up.</i>
4680080 4681570 ...to be over!
4682200 4683850 (MACHINE BEEPING RAPIDLY)
4696360 4699842 <i>CUTLER: Yeah, we haven't talked at all<br />about the facility where we shot.</i>
4699920 4701524 <i>The hospital. It's not a hospital.</i>
4701600 4704365 <i>There are no hospitals in Vancouver,<br />are there, where you're allowed to shoot?</i>
4704440 4705726 <i>GREENSPAN". None that will let you shoot...</i>
4705800 4707040 <i>CUTLER: There are plenty<br />of hospitals in Vancouver</i>
4707120 4709487 <i>-if you need a gall bladder operation.<br />- GREENSPAN: ...for three weeks.</i>
4709600 4711887 <i>CUTLER". But not if you're making a film.</i>
4711960 4715043 <i>Which is amazing, because<br />they have so much production there.</i>
4715120 4718124 <i>You would think somebody<br />would let you use their hospital.</i>
4718200 4720931 <i>So, as a result, there is one place</i>
4721000 4725483 <i>where everybody who shoots in Vancouver<br />shoots hospital scenes.</i>
4725560 4727130 <i>What's it called?</i>
4727240 4728844 - G <i>RE</i> E N S <i>PAN: Riverview.</i><br /><i>-Riverview.</i>
4728920 4732811 <i>GREENSPAN: It's an abandoned<br />insane asylum,</i>
4734880 4738965 <i>and this really is credit<br />to the great Brent Thomas,</i>
4739040 4742567 <i>because it's just hallways,<br />and he built the set.</i>
4742640 4744051 <i>CUTLER". Now, you say that it's abandoned,</i>
4744120 4746487 <i>but it's abandoned by all living humans.</i>
4747680 4750001 <i>Ghost spirits still occupy it.</i>
4750080 4753084 <i>GREENSPAN: We think so.<br />We heard a weird clanking during shooting.</i>
4753160 4755766 <i>CUTLER: Whenever the cameras would roll,</i>
4755840 4757763 <i>-the pipes would clank.<br />-GREENSPAN: The pipes would clank.</i>
4757840 4762402 <i>CUTLER: Some people were more sensitive<br />to ghost spirits than others,</i>
4762480 4764687 <i>and more creeped out by it.</i>
4766720 4769644 <i>So, it made for an eerie<br />couple of weeks of shooting,</i>
4769720 4771051 <i>but we got through it.</i>
4771160 4773083 <i>Thank goodness we had that space.</i>
4773160 4777165 <i>And upstairs in that abandoned institution,</i>
4777240 4778765 <i>-we found...<br />-GREENSPAN: Was our New Year's party.</i>
4778840 4781605 <i>CUTLER: (CHUCKLING)</i> ...a <i>space to shoot<br />New Year's, and thank God we did,</i>
4781680 4783603 <i>because we wouldn't have been<br />able to fit it into the schedule</i>
4783680 4788242 <i>if we couldn't just run upstairs<br />and shoot New Year's.</i>
4788320 4791403 <i>This is no twenty-something's apartment.</i>
4791480 4795565 <i>It is a rooftop of an abandoned...</i>
4795640 4797768 - GREENSPAN: Insane asylum.<br />-(BOTH LAUGHING)
4798640 4802964 <i>CUTLER: But a place<br />where a great love story could be told.</i>
4803520 4804885 I promise you.
4805400 4806811 Wait, what am I promising?
4808040 4810361 That we'll spend next New Year's together.
4811280 4814409 <i>CUTLER: There was always this question<br />of, "When do they break up?</i>
4814480 4817643 <i>"How do they break up?"<br />And, again, like life,</i>
4817720 4822760 <i>sometimes it happens<br />not in a big, dramatic movie scene,</i>
4822880 4824848 <i>but just in a realization.</i>
4824920 4826206 I guess we both know<br />where this is heading.
4826280 4827281 <i>CUTLER". And there it is.</i>
4840920 4842365 Yeah, I guess so.
4847520 4850888 <i>CUTLER: We talked at the very beginning of<br />this conversation about reading the book,</i>
4850960 4853645 <i>and how certain emotional moments</i>
4856960 4860362 <i>just blew me away. I know you had<br />a similar experience when you read it.</i>
4861240 4863129 <i>One of them was the scene</i>
4863200 4866568 <i>between Mia and Kat at the kitchen sink<br />on New Year's Day.</i>
4866640 4867926 <i>And that is this scene.</i>
4868000 4873245 <i>For me, this was a defining moment<br />in the very first experience</i>
4873320 4875288 <i>I had with this story. Reading the book.</i>
4875360 4878011 <i>And I always knew<br />it would be a defining moment in the film,</i>
4878080 4882768 <i>because of the way that<br />mother and daughter connect.</i>
4883280 4887444 <i>The way that mother<br />can't solve the problem</i>
4887520 4890490 <i>her daughter is<br />begging her to help her solve,</i>
4890560 4894326 <i>but the way that she loves her through it,<br />and embraces her through it,</i>
4894400 4897643 <i>and promises her that she'll be there</i>
4898800 4903408 <i>no matter what decision<br />her daughter makes.</i>
4903480 4906882 <i>It's just very powerful to me.</i>
4906960 4911409 <i>Consistent with that theme of seeing,<br />and being seen, and being understood.</i>
4913160 4917529 <i>GREENSPAN: I love that she doesn't try<br />and whitewash it for her daughter.</i>
4917640 4919608 <i>Say, "Oh, it's all gonna be okay."</i>
4919680 4923002 <i>She basically says, "Life's a bitch,"<br />you know? It's messy.</i>
4923080 4925560 <i>It's a great scene.</i>
4925920 4927126 Oh, God.
4927280 4929521 I'm such a mess.
4929800 4934169 You know, we had this perfect<br />year and a half together.
4936920 4941721 And now,<br />we're just moving in different directions.
4941840 4943205 Is it over?
4944360 4945521 Yeah.
4950040 4951804 You're supposed to break up with someone
4951880 4953325 because you're not in love with them.
4953400 4955164 Not because you're completely<br />in love with them.
4955240 4957481 <i>GREENSPAN: This was also<br />day three or four of shooting.</i>
4957560 4959324 <i>- It was early...<br />- CUTLER: Very early.</i>
4959400 4960526 <i>...for them to find</i>
4960640 4961766 <i>-that rhythm and groove.<br />- CUTLER: Mmm-hmm.</i>
4961840 4963888 <i>GREENSPAN: They both just snapped into it.</i>
4966320 4970291 <i>CUTLER: Also, we shot this scene<br />for several hours</i>
4970400 4973085 <i>because we couldn't complete a shot<br />without an airplane coming.</i>
4973160 4977324 <i>It was like all of a sudden,<br />this house had become ground zero</i>
4977400 4982008 <i>for all overhead flying<br />in the country of Canada.</i>
4983560 4985369 <i>GREENSPAN: And Chloé kept on<br />bringing the tears.</i>
4985440 4988410 <i>It's so hard to stay in the moment.</i>
4988480 4991609 <i>CUTLER: But they did it,<br />and they did it so beautifully.</i>
4991760 4994286 I am being completely torn in half.
4996240 4999403 You're going to go to Juilliard<br />and play the hell out of your cello.
5000760 5002603 Or you're not.
5003680 5007321 You're gonna stay with Adam<br />and have lots of amazing adventures.
5007520 5009090 Or you're not.
5009240 5012130 Or maybe tomorrow,<br />the Earth's gonna smash into a meteor.
5012280 5013645 Or it's not.
5014360 5017682 Life is this big fat gigantic stinking mess.
5017840 5019968 But that's the beauty of it too.
5021600 5023762 Whatever you do, I support you.
5023960 5025610 Either way, you win.
5026600 5029046 And also either way<br />there's something that you lose.
5031440 5033283 What can I say, baby?
5034200 5036282 True love's a bitch.
5045600 5048001 <i>CUTLER: And so, at the same exact moment</i>
5048080 5053484 <i>that Mia in the past-tense story<br />has to be deciding what to do,</i>
5054280 5058080 <i>Mia in the present<br />has to be deciding what to do.</i>
5058160 5060811 <i>GREENSPAN: The two storylines<br />have caught up with each other here.</i>
5061320 5062845 <i>CUTLER". That leads to the scene</i>
5062920 5066367 <i>we've been referencing<br />throughout this conversation,</i>
5066440 5067930 -which is...<br />- GREENSPAN: Gramps.
5068040 5069769 <i>...the Gramps bedside scene.</i>
5071480 5074848 <i>And there are so many things about this<br />that are wonderful.</i>
5076000 5078606 <i>We should just<br />let the viewer watch the scene.</i>
5081960 5083962 <i>These two remarkable performances.</i>
5086480 5092931 <i>Except to add that<br />it is the one sequence in the film</i>
5093000 5095571 <i>where Mia,</i>
5097000 5102006 <i>her spirit, can be felt<br />by one of the other characters.</i>
5108240 5110561 I've been trying to think
5110720 5114691 of what Denny<br />would want me to say to you.
5115520 5117204 The kid was a helluva of dad, wasn't he?
5118440 5120442 He sure had me beat.
5121600 5126049 I remember the day that he quit the band.
5127760 5130411 He just up and said,
5130560 5133291 "That's it. The time has come."
5135040 5137042 I was surprised.
5138720 5141929 I never really liked<br />the way the band sounded,
5143080 5145048 but I knew how important it was to him.
5145240 5148642 And so I asked him, I said,<br />"Why are you quitting?"
5149560 5151847 And he said,
5151920 5155527 "You make sacrifices for your kids.
5155600 5157364 "For your kids."
5158720 5160529 He said that without even blinking.
5160600 5162568 That's why he quit the band.
5162760 5164171 For Teddy.
5164320 5165560 <i>For you.</i>
5166760 5169843 It was when he heard you play so well.
5170000 5172401 I think that's when it clicked for him.
5173640 5176246 Your incredible talent, it...
5176800 5180407 He just couldn't believe it.
5180520 5184605 And all he wanted to do<br />was to give you more.
5184760 5186808 So, he quit the band,
5186920 5188684 he sold his drum kit
5189800 5191450 and he bought you that cello.
5193440 5194965 Sacrifice.
5195840 5198491 That's what we do<br />for the people that we love.
5200680 5202603 And here's mine, Mia.
5203520 5205284 I want you to live.
5205960 5208281 I want that more than anything<br />in this world.
5208440 5211967 I want you to fight like hell to stay with us.
5213320 5216290 But, with everybody else gone,
5216480 5218482 I know it might not be what you want.
5218640 5222804 It might be too hard for you<br />to keep fighting, so...
5225800 5227529 If you wanna go,
5228960 5231167 (VOICE BREAKING)<br />I want you to know it's okay.
5232200 5233565 It's okay.
5237160 5239003 I understand.
5250520 5252010 Thank you.
5260040 5261166 Gramps?
5264640 5266130 <i>CUTLER". My feeling was somehow that,</i>
5266200 5269010 <i>as we get closer to leaving</i>
5269760 5271888 <i>the earthly realm,</i>
5271960 5275282 <i>those whom we love</i>
5276520 5278682 <i>can feel us most strongly,</i>
5278760 5282810 <i>and that's why<br />that moment was so important.</i>
5282920 5285924 <i>There's a moment, one moment, later on,</i>
5286000 5289447 <i>as she's saying goodbye to Kim,<br />that she touches her,</i>
5289520 5292171 <i>and Kim looks down at her hand<br />where she's touching her,</i>
5293720 5297441 <i>and they both got it. They understood that.</i>
5298920 5301048 <i>That's why that moment works so well.</i>
5304160 5308324 <i>I love this scene. How she moves,<br />the spirit moves around the room.</i>
5311800 5316567 <i>This brings us back to the first scene<br />we saw Liana do in audition.</i>

5323960 5325200 <i>CUTLER: But all of the things<br />we've talked about,</i>
5325280 5328841 <i>the connection between these people,</i>
5330800 5333371 <i>and the fact that we filmed this<br />at the end of the film,</i>

5336800 5339849 <i>GREENSPAN: It just worked.<br />-...it all contributes to it.</i>
5339920 5342207 Some are related to you and some aren't,

5365000 5369085 <i>CUTLER: This is<br />an interesting narrative thing</i>
5369160 5371527 <i>that comes straight from Gayle's book.</i>
5371600 5376527 <i>At exactly the same moment in the book<br />comes the memory</i>
5376640 5377766 <i>-of the family picnic.<br />-GREENSPAN: The best day.</i>
5377840 5379126 <i>CUTLER". "The best day of my life."</i>
5379200 5384047 <i>Usually, you would expect,<br />at this moment, for the scene to have</i>
5384120 5387886 <i>some narrative propulsion,<br />something dramatic would happen.</i>
5387960 5390008 <i>But really what happens is<br />an emotional moment.</i>
5391120 5395489 <i>It's a moment where Mia realizes,</i>
5396480 5399211 <i>as she says,<br />that she's part of something larger.</i>
5400720 5404770 <i>We borrowed this realization she had<br />in another place in the book,</i>
5404840 5408049 <i>that the cello, she always thought<br />of the cello as a solo instrument,</i>
5408120 5410726 <i>but then she realized<br />it was part of something larger</i>
5410840 5413764 <i>even as she realizes<br />that she's part of something larger.</i>
5413840 5418243 <i>And that's the transformational moment.</i>
5420080 5426690 <i>But a moment, as well, that her spirit<br />realizes can no longer exist.</i>
5426760 5428649 <i>Or at least she thinks that,</i>
5428720 5431929 <i>and that's what leads her<br />to make the decision</i> to...
5433240 5434605 GREENSPAN: To go.<br />CUTLER: To go.
5435520 5439491 <i>GREENSPAN: This was</i> a <i>tough song<br />to find, the Smashing Pumpkins' Today.</i>
5439560 5441767 CUTLER: It was, <i>it</i> was.

5453360 5456409 <i>We tried for a long time, and then<br />we tried a number of different songs,</i>
5456480 5460451 <i>and it had to work not only as a song</i>

5959520 5964208 <i>How could I live before?</i>
5964560 5968360 <i>How could I have been so blind?</i>
5968480 5970289 (AUDIO DISTORTING)
5970400 5972687 <i>So blind</i>
5974280 5976362 <i>CUTLER: And here, we rely on</i>
5978400 5983884 <i>that handheld memory footage<br />that becomes increasingly de-saturated.</i>
5984400 5987085 <i>Sounds of Mia's life, her memories,</i>
5987720 5989768 <i>as she's struggling to make the choice.</i>
5989840 5994243 <i>I always said there would be a sound of<br />something breaking, something cracking,</i>
5995400 5999291 <i>and a real sense that, at the end of the day,</i>
6000280 6003602 <i>she had chosen to go, after all.</i>
6006080 6007411 (SILENCE)
6019280 6020406 (GASPS)
6023760 6024807 Mia.
6025440 6026885 (BALLAD PLAYING)
6027480 6029608 <i>CUTLER". Then she chooses life.</i>
6033880 6036486 <i>And that is the end of If</i> I <i>Stay.</i>
6036560 6037766 Um...
6038720 6039926 <i>- I'll say this...<br />- GREENSPAN: Thank you, R.J.</i>
6040000 6041047 <i>CUTLER". Thank you, Alison.</i>
6041120 6044966 <i>I'll say this about<br />the song you're hearing by Tom Odell,</i>
6045040 6046804 <i>which is called</i> Heal.
6049080 6053324 <i>We knew so much more about<br />what this final song needed to be,</i>
6053440 6054965 <i>the closing credits song,</i>
6055040 6058886 <i>than we did<br />about how we would ever find it.</i>
6059360 6062364 <i>What we knew about the song was<br />it had to be a beautiful song</i>
6062440 6066286 <i>that somehow spoke to<br />the content of the movie.</i>
6066640 6068881 <i>The name of this song is</i> Heal.
6069800 6074408 <i>And would allow the audience<br />to transition down</i>
6074480 6077848 <i>from this very emotional<br />roller-coaster experience</i>
6077920 6080002 <i>that they had just been on.</i>
6081800 6086488 <i>Again, this was a case where<br />we listened to hundreds of songs,</i>
6087320 6092042 <i>and only when we heard this song</i>
6092120 6095283 <i>did we feel that<br />we'd found what we were looking for.</i>
6101320 6102606 <i>And then Tom went into the studio</i>
6102680 6108449 <i>and did a special version of it just for us<br />that included this choir</i>
6109760 6112684 <i>and elevated it to<br />an even more spiritual level,</i>
6112880 6115963 <i>which is what we were looking for.</i>
6116520 6120684 <i>So, thanks to him. Thanks to you, Alison.</i>
6121680 6124604 <i>Thanks to our dear friends at MGM.</i>
6124720 6127644 <i>GREENSPAN: The great Jon Glickman<br />and Matt Dines</i>
6127720 6131884 <i>and Gary Barber,<br />who took a chance on our movie.</i>
6132480 6136485 <i>CUTLER: Thanks to our good friends<br />at New Line Cinema.</i>
6136560 6138528 <i>GREENSPAN: And Warner Brothers.<br />CUTLER". And Warner Brothers.</i>
6138600 6140204 <i>GREENSPAN: For distributing the film.</i>
6140320 6142129 <i>CUTLER: To Toby Emmerich.<br />GREENSPAN: We're so grateful.</i>
6143880 6147043 <i>Richard Brener. Kevin Tsujihara.</i>
6148000 6151163 CUTLER: <i>And</i> everyone else there. Sue Kroll.
6152440 6156001 <i>Thanks, as well,<br />to everybody who worked on the film.</i>
6156080 6158560 <i>You get to see their names here.</i>
6159040 6162169 <i>Hopefully, we've spoken about all of them<br />a little bit,</i>
6162240 6165562 <i>and given you a sense<br />of their contribution to this film.</i>
6166800 6169690 <i>Certainly, one of the things<br />that becomes clear to me</i>
6169760 6172445 <i>in having had this conversation</i>
6175600 6178922 <i>is how much<br />this was a complete collaboration.</i>
6179000 6184723 <i>How everybody's contribution is cause for</i>
6186280 6187691 <i>whatever it is in the film</i>
6187760 6193210 <i>that may have succeeded<br />as we hoped and dreamt it would.</i>
6193280 6198320 <i>These names of these people are the ones...</i>
6198400 6200129 <i>GREENSPAN: Made it happen.<br />-...who made that contribution.</i>
6200200 6204762 <i>And, really, if everybody wasn't<br />rowing the boat in the same direction,</i>
6204840 6208322 <i>and giving it their all, and working like dogs</i>
6208400 6212450 <i>on rainy, dark days in Vancouver</i>
6212560 6216804 <i>and through weeks and months<br />of post-production,</i>
6219800 6221723 <i>none of it would have<br />come out the way it did.</i>
6221800 6226647 <i>So, thanks to everybody<br />who contributed to the film.</i>
6226720 6229200 <i>And once again, my friend, thanks to you.</i>
6229280 6230406 <i>What a thrill, what a joy.</i>
6230480 6231641 <i>GREENSPAN: Thanks to you,<br />for bringing it to life.</i>
6231720 6232960 <i>CUTLER: And this was a blast.</i>
6233080 6235162 <i>GREENSPAN: A true labor of love, this one.</i>
6235240 6237641 <i>Couple of years, and you did it.</i>
6238160 6241243 <i>I think everybody worked their butts off<br />on a shoestring,</i>
6241320 6244642 <i>but you said it beautifully,<br />just really a labor of love.</i>
6244720 6248964 <i>CUTLER: And thanks to you for watching.<br />We couldn't appreciate it more.</i>
6249400 6252324 <i>- Okay, this is us high-fiving each other.<br />-(BOTH HIGH-FIVING)</i>
6253040 6254087 GREENSPAN: (CHUCKLES) Ow.
