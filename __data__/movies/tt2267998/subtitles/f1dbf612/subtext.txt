22773 23774 When I think of my wife...
26193 28695 ...I always think of her head.
30155 33075 I picture cracking her lovely skull...
33116 35369 unspooling her brains...
35410 38038 trying to get answers.
39248 42751 The primal questions of any marriage.
42793 45128 "What are you thinking?"
45170 47422 "How are you feeling?"
47464 50092 "What have we done to each other?"
145062 149066 The Irish prince<br />graces us with his presence.
150734 153862 His majesty prefers not to be moistened.
155072 156365 I got you a present.
157950 159409 -I hated this game.<br />-You loved it.
159451 160744 You loved it.
160786 163080 Thank you.<br />I'll add it to the collection.
163872 166041 Can you pour me a bourbon?
172297 174383 What's up, Jitters?
178095 180430 Well, if you're not going to talk,<br />I'm gonna have to fill the silence...
180472 183851 with another excruciating story<br />by Margo Dunne.
183892 186562 I could tell you about<br />my recent customer service experience...
186603 188605 -changing Internet service providers.<br />-I like that one.
188647 191525 Or how about the time I saw that woman<br />who looked exactly like my friend Monica?
191567 193485 But it wasn't Monica.<br />It was a total stranger.
193527 195445 Who was also named Monica.
195904 197406 -Made it kind of interesting.<br />-It's great.
198240 199575 I'm just having a bad day.
199616 201577 -Amy?<br />-It's our anniversary.
201618 203579 -Five years.<br />-Five?
203620 204788 That came fast.
204830 206164 And furious.
210711 213797 I'm so crazy, stupid happy.
216633 218093 I met a boy.
218135 222556 A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.
224808 226101 Excuse me, miss?
226143 227603 I just want you to be careful...
227644 230439 where you put down that<br />monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
230480 233192 because the party's down to three<br />Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.
233233 234943 It might attract<br />some desperate characters.
234985 237821 It could.<br />I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa.
241909 244453 They already relieved me<br />of my artisanal meat platter.
244494 247372 Finally, someone tells me<br />how to pronounce that word.
247414 248373 "Meat"?
248415 249666 Yes, "meat." One syllable.
250000 252669 Thank you. Whose beer am I<br />about to drink?
252711 254004 Don't tell me.
254671 256339 Let's see, who's your type?
256757 257841 I don't see you sitting quietly...
257882 261470 while he bloviates<br />on his postgrad thesis about Proust.
261512 263805 Uh-oh. Is that him?
263847 266058 Ironic hipster, so self-aware,<br />he makes everything a joke.
266350 269353 I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."
271188 272523 What type are you?
272564 274024 Corn-fed,<br />salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.
274066 275192 Missouri?
275234 276151 Cute.
276193 278529 -Native New Yorker?<br />-The world ends at the Hudson.
278570 279655 What's your name?
279696 280656 Amy.
280697 283033 Well, Amy, who are you?
284368 287538 A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.
287579 291750 B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.
291792 294920 C, I write personality quizzes<br />for magazines.
295295 299508 Okay. Your hands are far too delicate<br />for real scrimshaw work...
299550 302803 and I happen to be a charter subscriber<br />to Middling Warlord Weekly...
302845 304054 so I'd recognize you.
304388 305722 I'm gonna go with "C."
305764 307182 And you?
308016 309560 Who are you?
309601 313939 I'm the guy to save you<br />from all this awesomeness.
318026 320863 So, you write for a men's magazine.
320904 324157 God, does that make you an expert<br />on being a man?
324199 325284 No.
326076 327369 It's what to wear, what to drink.
327411 329371 How to bullshit.
329413 330998 Never with you.
331039 331874 Ha, ha.
331915 333542 No, I mean it.
333584 335377 It's hard to believe you.
335419 336211 Why?
336253 337880 I think it's your chin.
337921 339047 My chin?
339089 341758 Yeah, it's quite villainous.
341800 343427 Okay, how's this?
344428 347598 A hundred percent true, no bullshit.
347973 348932 Okay.
348974 350559 We all move to New York...
350601 354730 and we end up living in these little<br />cubby holes, and that's not it.
354771 358233 Come outside. Then, you're in it.
360652 362404 You have to see this.
370954 372039 Hey.
372080 373040 Hey.
382049 383800 I have to kiss you now.
383842 385260 Is that right?
385302 388472 I can't let you go through<br />a sugar storm unkissed.
390307 391475 Wait a second.
394186 395646 There you go.
407574 408992 Nick Dunne...
410744 412829 I really like you.
419002 421255 So, is Amy gonna do<br />one of those anniversary...
422214 423507 treasure hunts?
423549 425551 You mean the forced march<br />designed to prove...
425592 428554 what an oblivious and uncaring asshole<br />her husband is?
428595 429680 Wow.
432516 434226 Life. I don't remember the point.
434268 436478 Deep Hasbro thoughts.
436520 437855 Spin.
438689 440899 What was the clue last year<br />she got so mad about?
440941 444236 "When your poor Amy has a cold...
444278 445988 "this dessert just must be sold."
446029 446989 The answer?
447030 448824 I still don't know the answer, Go.
448866 451034 -A few years ago, you'd have known.<br />-A few years ago, it was fun.
451076 452744 Year one,<br />the traditional gift was paper.
452786 456248 She got me a beautiful notebook.<br />Told me to go write my novel.
456290 457165 What did you get her?
457207 458584 A kite.
458625 460460 -She'd never flown a kite.<br />-Okay.
461420 464006 Anyway. Year four, flowers.
464047 467301 She led me outside<br />to the dying rosebush in the backyard.
467634 468677 That's symbolic.
468719 469678 Yeah.
469720 471180 What's the gift for five?
471221 472014 Wood.
472055 474516 -So, what did you get her?<br />-There's no good gift for wood.
474558 477895 I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,<br />slap her with your penis.
477936 479396 "There's some wood for you, bitch."
482941 484234 The Bar.
484985 487404 Why, yes. Hang on one second.
487446 488614 Hey, it's Watchful Wally.
490908 492910 Hey, Walt. What's going on?
495287 498373 Thanks very much. I'll be right there.<br />All right, bye-bye.
510594 513263 Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?
514472 515974 Thanks, Walt!
531657 533033 Ame?
553387 554847 Amy!
567526 568193 Hello?
568694 570153 Come on in.
570904 571697 Hey.
571738 573156 -Mister Dunne.<br />-Hi.
573198 575701 I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.<br />This is Officer James Gilpin.
575742 577703 We understand there are concerns<br />about your wife.
577744 581665 I don't know where my wife is.<br />And I came home to this.
582708 585502 Now, I don't panic easily...
585836 587921 but it's weird, right?
589173 590174 Mind if we look around?
590424 591341 Please.
591383 592634 How long have you two been here?
592676 595512 Two years in September.<br />We used to live in New York.
595554 596638 City?
596680 599808 Yeah, I was a writer.<br />We were both writers.
599850 601476 Why did you all move back here?
601518 603145 My mom got sick.
603187 606148 Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?
606190 607649 She's dead.
607691 608692 I'm so sorry.
614406 616700 What do you do now, for work?
617576 619411 My sister Margo and I<br />own The Bar downtown.
619870 621705 Oh, The Bar.
621747 623999 Love the name. Very meta.
624041 625125 Thanks.
628086 629880 Pretty things.
634635 635969 Stay.
636011 637763 My office, here.
640807 642851 Beautiful dress.
646855 647648 Date night?
647689 648941 It's our anniversary.
652110 653612 It's a guest bedroom, there.
653904 655531 Cat's room on the end.
655572 657115 I checked up here.
661495 662579 This is the kitchen...
662621 663956 obviously.
679721 681557 This is my wife's office.
681598 683225 Amy's office.
696280 699324 Wow. Impressive gal.
699366 700576 Yeah. Should I be concerned?
700617 701785 I remember these.
703036 704288 I loved these books.
708458 709877 Wait a minute.
709918 711920 Your wife is Amazing Amy?
712504 714840 Yeah. She is.
714882 716508 Wow.
719511 723140 Amazing-fucking-Amy<br />is getting fucking married.
723182 724975 That's how the night started.
725017 731106 With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br />jealous, as always, of the golden child.
731148 735736 Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,<br />who's getting fucking married.
736069 737863 When I was 10, I quit cello.
737905 741491 In the next book,<br />Amazing Amy became a prodigy.
743952 744745 Did you play volleyball?
744995 746872 I got cut, freshman year.
746914 748832 She made varsity.
750250 752252 When did you have a dog?
752294 753295 She got the dog.
753921 756423 Puddles made her more relatable.
756465 757799 Wow.
757841 759968 I love your parents...
760010 761803 but they really can be assholes.
761845 763305 -Nick!<br />-Sir!
763347 765140 Hey, thanks for coming, man.
765182 765974 No problem.
766016 767434 Hey, sweetheart.
768018 769436 Big night for your mom.
769478 773315 It would mean so much<br />if you would talk to a few reporters...
773357 775234 bloggers, give them a little Amy color.
775275 777152 People wanna hear from you.
777194 778820 -We can't stay long.<br />-Fantastic.
778862 781031 Fifteen minutes, tops.
781365 785661 This is why I have my brownstone.<br />My trust fund. I know I can't complain.
785702 788330 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
788372 792417 No, they improved upon it,<br />and then peddled it to the masses.
792459 794670 I thought you were gonna wear white<br />to match the wedding theme.
794711 796171 I thought that would be creepy.
796213 798674 "If it's worth doing,<br />it's worth doing--"
798715 801051 Hold up! I know how this ends.<br />Don't tell me.
801093 802886 You're very cute, Nick.
802928 804555 Amy, you know<br />what would make Dad's night.
804596 806223 I'm on it.
807516 810519 I love having strangers<br />pick at my scabs.
810561 811812 I'm curious whether...
811854 813564 it's difficult for you to see<br />Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
814189 817025 And this big party<br />celebrating this fictional wedding.
817067 819403 Because it's my understanding<br />you are not married.
819444 821113 Is that correct?
822072 825826 Correct. Amazing Amy has always been<br />one step ahead of me.
825868 829705 Excuse me. I'm sorry,<br />I just have a few questions.
830080 830998 It's you.
831039 833584 I'm here in a<br />strictly journalistic capacity.
833876 837212 Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br />of dating Nick Dunne for how long?
837254 840048 -Two magical years.<br />-Two magical years.
840090 841925 In the course of that time,<br />you've had the opportunity...
841967 844428 to perform such gracious gestures as...
844469 848390 not correcting Nick when he<br />pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
848432 849892 An understandable mistake.
849933 851101 He also thought it was a fish.
851143 852728 He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.
853770 856064 You also manage to appear<br />shocked and delighted...
856106 858692 when Nick's elderly mother<br />breaks into an impromptu rendition...
858734 860944 of New York, New York,<br />every time she sees you.
860986 863030 [S]These bag of bone shoes
863071 864239 That's just frightening.
864281 866909 You also bought Nick<br />his very first pair of scissors.
866950 868619 And matching stapler.
868660 871580 Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.
871622 875125 You are brilliant,<br />yet entirely un-snobby.
875167 878795 You challenge me. You surprise me.
878837 880172 And, fun fact for the readers...
880589 882299 you have a world-class vagina.
885093 887429 My colleagues tell me<br />that you are not yet married.
887971 889765 Is that correct?
889806 891266 I'm not.
891308 892643 Isn't it time we fixed that?
894102 895771 And then...
895812 898649 the night wasn't so bad anymore.
914998 917501 And it's done. Crossed off the list.
917543 921505 Now, normally, we would not treat this<br />as a missing persons case so quick...
921547 922965 but given the scene at your house...
923006 925133 and given our spike<br />in violent crime of late...
925175 927636 we are gonna take this<br />very, very seriously.
927678 928637 Okay. Good.
928679 931974 We've got forensics over at your place.<br />You got somewhere to stay?
932015 933600 -I could stay at my sister's.<br />-Okay.
933642 935936 We're tracking Amy's phone,<br />her credit cards.
935978 937646 We will organize searches,<br />put up flyers.
937688 940691 -We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.<br />-You're having a press conference?
940732 942317 I wanna get the word out, right?
942359 946655 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,<br />I feel like I'm on a Law &amp; Order episode.
954705 956874 Time is of the essence in these cases.
956915 959668 But, that said,<br />do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?
959710 960836 Absolutely not. I just wanna help.
960878 962671 So, you and Amy<br />have been here two years.
962713 965966 -You tend bar--<br />-I own The Bar.
966008 969511 And I teach creative writing at MVCC.
969553 971346 -No kids?<br />-Not yet.
971388 972848 So, what does Amy do most days?
972890 975100 A woman with all those degrees,<br />what does she do?
975601 977019 I don't know. She keeps busy.
977060 978562 Doing what?
980772 982399 She's a voracious reader.
982441 985277 So, she's always got a book in her hand.
986361 987821 Well, days can get long.
987863 991700 I know a few housewives, that<br />evening glass of wine starts coming at noon.
991742 993035 Or prescription pills.
993076 994578 Just last week, we had a soccer mom.
994620 997080 Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in<br />over some OxyContin.
997122 999208 Ever since that mall went bust,<br />half the town is out of work.
999249 1000751 We cannot keep up<br />with the drug violence.
1000792 1003212 I'm pretty sure that's not it.
1003253 1005088 Has Amy got friends we can talk to?
1007090 1008383 No, not really.
1008425 1010385 No friends? This whole town?
1010427 1014056 She was very close with my mom,<br />before she passed away.
1014097 1015933 You know, we have a pretty serious<br />homeless problem...
1016266 1017392 in our neighborhood.
1017726 1019311 I think maybe you guys<br />should check that out.
1020771 1021772 We'll look into that.
1021813 1024441 You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.
1024483 1026068 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that out.
1026108 1027069 Well, I was home.
1027109 1029738 I left at 9:30,<br />I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.
1029780 1031406 I went to Sawyer Beach<br />and read the news.
1031448 1033617 Did you visit with anyone there?
1033659 1035618 I kind of go to Sawyer Beach<br />for the solitude.
1036787 1039373 So, your wife has no friends here.
1039414 1041250 Is she kinda standoffish?
1041290 1043710 Ivy League? Rubs people the wrong way?
1043752 1045253 She's from New York.
1046421 1049758 She's complicated.<br />She's got very high standards.
1049800 1050634 Type A?
1050968 1053554 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1053595 1056431 You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.
1056473 1058642 Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?
1059184 1060978 God, I don't know.<br />I'd have to look it up at the house.
1061019 1063814 You don't know if she has friends,<br />you don't know what she does all day...
1063856 1065774 and you don't know<br />your wife's blood type.
1065816 1066942 Sure you all are married?
1068694 1069653 Maybe it's type O.
1069695 1071905 -Where are her folks? New York?<br />-Yeah.
1071947 1073657 Can they get here time<br />for this press conference tomorrow?
1073699 1075742 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1075784 1077619 You haven't called<br />your wife's parents yet?
1077661 1080080 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1080122 1082583 Call them, please, Nick. Now.
1082624 1083834 Fine.
1089339 1091300 Should I know my wife's blood type?
1091341 1092342 No.
1092676 1096471 I apologize, Marybeth.<br />I didn't know what was going on.
1096513 1098015 Now I'm at the station...
1098056 1101560 and the cops are at the house,<br />and it's serious and I'm calling you.
1102269 1105230 There's a lot of things<br />that are being juggled right now.
1105272 1108525 I'm standing right next to<br />Detective Rhonda Boney...
1108567 1110527 who's the lead investigator on this<br />and she's...
1112779 1114948 My mother-in-law<br />would like to speak with you.
1116366 1117659 This is Detective Boney.
1117701 1119036 I wanna go home.
1119077 1121538 I don't know why I have to be here.
1121580 1124208 I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.
1124249 1125375 Dad?
1125792 1127377 This is my father. What's going on?
1127419 1128462 Really? You're Nick Dunne?
1128712 1130714 We've been trying to get a hold of you<br />all afternoon.
1130756 1132424 I've been right there.<br />My wife is missing.
1132466 1133592 -Bitch.<br />-Don't.
1133634 1136011 Your father wandered out of Comfort Hill<br />after lunch.
1136053 1138430 We found him walking Route 79,<br />disoriented.
1138472 1139932 We've been trying to call you<br />for the last--
1139973 1141225 I don't get a cell signal<br />in this building.
1141266 1143227 I've been sitting<br />20 feet away from you.
1143560 1145187 Sir, please<br />don't take that tone with me.
1145229 1146355 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.
1146396 1147940 Dad, stop.
1150609 1151818 You wanna drive him home?
1152486 1154780 I think that would be wise. Thanks.
1174341 1177427 This voice mailbox is currently full.
1178345 1179263 Fuck.
1181473 1184059 Get your fucking hands off me.
1184101 1185477 Thanks.
1198282 1202452 Everyone told us<br />and told us and told us...
1202494 1205080 marriage is hard work.
1205122 1208166 And compromise and more work.
1208208 1210460 "Abandon all hope, ye who enter."
1210502 1213422 "When young Amy's hope did wane...
1213463 1214798 "she wandered here..."
1214840 1217342 Well, it's not true.<br />Not for me and Nick.
1217384 1220012 "...in search of Jane."
1220053 1222973 With us, two years...
1223223 1224641 it's just good.
1225142 1226977 Austen.
1228478 1232482 You were an alienated teen<br />and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.
1232983 1234985 Look at that.
1236820 1238197 My God.
1238697 1239990 You naughty minx.
1240032 1243118 Well, technically, we are supposed<br />to fuck at the next stop.
1243160 1244786 Yeah, in keeping with tradition.
1244828 1248332 But I might be willing<br />to bend the rules this once.
1248373 1250083 God bless Jane Austen.
1265432 1269436 I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br />It's confirmed by the...
1272397 1274691 Thank you.
1275734 1277194 Year two. Cotton.
1283951 1288205 We had that joke that our sex<br />was too good for ordinary.
1288247 1290707 So, these are 2,000 thread-count--
1295754 1298674 We're so cute.<br />I wanna punch us in the face.
1298715 1301927 That's pretty great.<br />I mean, that is pretty great.
1303387 1304847 Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?
1304888 1307057 I don't need a lawyer.<br />Here, I'll do this.
1307558 1309518 Well, did they ask personal stuff<br />about Amy?
1309560 1310727 You know, they asked...
1311061 1312521 why didn't she have any friends?
1312563 1313397 What did you say?
1313438 1315440 -I said she was complicated.<br />-Nick!
1316441 1319069 Everyone knows "complicated"<br />is code for "bitch."
1324491 1326285 God. I feel sick.
1326326 1327744 Thanks.
1328745 1330038 It's so bizarre.
1330080 1332583 It seems like the kind of thing<br />that would happen to Amy.
1332624 1333792 She always attracts--
1333834 1335419 Drama?
1336253 1337629 You can say it. It's just me and you.
1337671 1340215 Just because<br />I don't like to be around Amy...
1340257 1341508 doesn't mean I don't care about her.
1344595 1346763 Anyway, whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.
1356106 1358150 Detective? Excuse me.
1358192 1360819 I'm Noelle Hawthorne.<br />I'm Amy's best friend.
1361945 1364615 Well, great. Where do you live, Noelle?
1365157 1366658 Five doors down. 1032.
1366700 1368911 Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.
1368952 1370829 Can I come by in half an hour?
1370871 1372581 -Y'all know anything yet?<br />-I'm sorry.
1372623 1375417 I got guys on the clock in here.<br />But you give me 30 minutes.
1375459 1376793 But that's usually bath time.
1377544 1380130 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.
1382883 1384176 All right. So, what do you got?
1384218 1386845 It was definitely blood spatter<br />you saw in the kitchen.
1387346 1389014 Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.
1389056 1391433 Not that weird,<br />but that is awfully high.
1391475 1393101 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.
1393143 1394311 Well, okay.
1397022 1398106 Interesting.
1398148 1399274 What's that?
1399316 1402819 House is rented in her name.<br />Car's in her name.
1402861 1405989 Credit cards, utilities,<br />phone bill, all in her name.
1406031 1407866 Even his bar's in her name.
1407908 1409826 I don't know that that's so surprising.
1409868 1411495 No. But it is humiliating.
1411537 1412454 What you got?
1412496 1415332 It's with her unmentionables.
1427678 1430556 Well, we have our first clue.
1441650 1443318 I have to take a shower.
1443360 1445153 No, don't. You've been up all night.
1445195 1447364 You wanna look<br />like you've been up all night.
1448991 1451326 Hey, be careful today, okay?
1451368 1452703 That's a weird thing to say.
1452744 1456498 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.<br />You can seem angry, like--
1456540 1458041 Please don't say, "Like Dad."
1458083 1460836 Or else you swing into your momma's-boy<br />charm offensive and that can feel glib.
1460878 1461670 Perfect.
1461712 1464464 I'll balance on the exact fucking edge<br />of your emotional razor.
1464506 1466341 Okay. Just be...
1466383 1468302 Myself?
1468343 1470679 ...sponsoring a raffle to<br />benefit West County 4H...
1470721 1474183 and raffling season tickets for<br />Mizzou football.
1474224 1477519 Buy your tickets at the Wing Hut or<br />local Tri-State Tire stores.
1482107 1483442 Your in-laws made it.
1485444 1486486 -Hi, Rand.<br />-Hey, man.
1486528 1487362 I'm Detective Boney.
1487404 1489364 I'm the twin. Margo.
1489406 1492492 We played tennis yesterday, Nick.<br />I just can't get over it.
1492534 1493869 Marybeth, I am really sorry.
1493911 1495704 I knew you never should have<br />moved back here.
1495746 1496872 We didn't have a lot of choice.
1496914 1500584 We are all worried. We are all scared.
1500626 1505088 But we are all here now.<br />And we will find Amy, together.
1515307 1517226 Should I just go first, and then<br />you guys can say something?
1517267 1518227 Good.
1519895 1524233 As you know, my wife,<br />Amy Elliott Dunne...
1524274 1527069 disappeared from our home<br />on the morning of July 5th...
1528028 1530572 under suspicious circumstances.
1530614 1532074 Louder!
1532115 1536537 If anyone out there<br />has any information...
1536578 1538914 please come forward.
1538956 1540582 Thank you.
1542918 1545754 I'm Rand Elliott.<br />My wife, Marybeth Elliott.
1545796 1546880 Should I have said my name?
1547464 1549424 Amy is our only child.
1549466 1553470 She's bright, she's beautiful.<br />She's kind.
1553971 1555472 She really is Amazing Amy.
1555806 1558517 You know, there are<br />millions of people out there...
1558559 1561103 who grew up with her and care about her.
1561144 1563772 We care about her, we love her.
1564481 1567067 And we just want her back.
1568986 1571613 Amy is a decorated scholar.
1571655 1574616 She forged a successful career<br />in journalism.
1574658 1576952 She returned here<br />to her husband's hometown...
1576994 1579329 and she made a life in her adopted home.
1580414 1582791 Now, Amy needs your help.
1582833 1586962 We're establishing a volunteer<br />headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
1587004 1592342 We have a hotline, 1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.
1592593 1598015 And our website is<br />www.FindAmazingAmy.com.
1598515 1600475 -Mr. Dunne!<br />-Mr. Elliott!
1601852 1603687 Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?
1605439 1609109 Mr. Elliott, when was the last time<br />you spoke to your daughter?
1610611 1611612 Smile.
1618202 1619786 That's all for now. Thank you.
1622372 1625209 Amy is the kind of girl<br />who attracts admirers.
1625250 1626126 Right, Nick?
1626168 1627336 Yeah, definitely.
1627377 1629880 And we've had instances...
1629922 1631965 -where things got--<br />-Scary.
1632007 1633467 Do you know about Desi Collings?
1633509 1635177 Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings.
1635219 1636470 He was obsessed.
1636512 1639848 He attempted suicide after Amy<br />broke up with him sophomore year.
1639890 1641433 We had to file a restraining order.
1641475 1643852 This would be high school?<br />Twenty years ago?
1643894 1647105 But he recently moved to St. Louis.<br />That's just two hours away.
1647147 1649024 To be fair, he is from St. Louis.
1649066 1650692 We also have Tommy O'Hara.
1650734 1652945 This is only eight years ago,<br />in New York.
1652986 1655280 She broke up with him,<br />he got very physical.
1655322 1656990 -She filed charges.<br />-What was the charge?
1657032 1659117 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?
1659159 1661119 I only know it was bad.
1661161 1662955 -I didn't know this.<br />-Okay.
1662996 1664915 Thank you.
1664957 1666250 Anything more recent?
1669586 1671588 Not that I know of.
1674049 1676969 Hey, Nick? You got a minute?
1678136 1679763 Yeah.
1685143 1686520 Imagine our confusion.
1686562 1687729 A missing persons case...
1687771 1690357 and in your wife's dressing room,<br />we find an envelope marked "clue."
1690399 1692651 That's for our anniversary.
1692693 1694987 My wife does these treasure hunts.
1695028 1697406 I'm hoping you can tell me<br />what this means.
1697447 1698448 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?
1698866 1701076 It'll help me track Amy's movements<br />before she disappeared.
1701410 1703579 Of course. Okay.
1703620 1706206 "Although this spot<br />couldn't be tighter...
1706957 1709668 "it's a cozy room<br />for my favorite writer."
1712504 1713714 I know this one!
1714214 1717718 Although this spot<br />couldn't be any tighter...
1718343 1721138 it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
1722639 1726059 After-school meeting,<br />don't mind if I do.
1726101 1729021 Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.
1733066 1735402 Well, well. What does it say?
1735444 1736945 Clue two.
1738071 1741450 "Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.
1741950 1745829 "You'll be the spy,<br />and I'll be his lover.
1746330 1747372 "Let's head on over...
1747414 1749291 "to the little brown house.
1749333 1753045 "We'll play hot, doting husband,<br />sweet, loving spouse."
1756089 1756840 These yours?
1757716 1758717 No.
1758759 1760219 But you read the first clue.
1760260 1763388 Randy professor, naughty student.
1763430 1764473 I blush.
1764515 1766266 Me and my ex just swapped cards.
1767476 1768852 Where's this little brown house?
1768894 1770395 I have no idea.
1813605 1814982 Hello?
1815649 1817526 Nicholas Dunne.
1818193 1821280 Under my father's name, William Dunne.
1827703 1831790 My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?<br />Can you just turn the bell--
1831832 1832791 Yeah, I know.
1832833 1834459 It's... It's...
1836920 1839214 It's "Puddles," right?<br />Or is it "Poodles?"
1843135 1844761 We're good.
1846346 1847472 Hello, stranger.
1847514 1849641 Fancy meeting you here.
1849683 1851977 It's your dad's house, right?
1852019 1853645 Are you following me?
1853687 1854563 What you doing?
1854605 1856773 Like you said, it's my dad's house.
1856815 1859526 I come by once a week,<br />make sure the place hasn't burned down.
1861320 1862613 But it looks okay.
1863363 1865240 I'll walk you out.
1868493 1869995 You know...
1870037 1873290 I thought maybe<br />this was the little brown house.
1873332 1874541 From the clue.
1874583 1876543 Nope. Still blue.
1893018 1897231 Picture me,<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.
1897272 1900984 I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished," I mean "had."
1901485 1904613 It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.
1904905 1908659 "So open the door, and look alive."
1909952 1910994 Bitch!
1914706 1917709 Want to test your marriage<br />for weak spots?
1918377 1919837 Add one recession...
1920170 1921463 subtract two jobs.
1922047 1924174 It's surprisingly effective.
1924216 1926635 Promise me we'll never be like them.
1926677 1927803 Like who?
1927845 1929596 All those awful couples we know.
1929638 1933600 Those wives who treat their men<br />like dancing monkeys...
1933642 1935102 to be trained and paraded.
1935727 1938438 Husbands who treat their wives<br />like the highway patrol...
1938814 1941400 to be out-foxed and avoided.
1946154 1947823 I think I'm gonna be laid off.
1948615 1951410 We're in a recession.<br />If it happens, we'll deal with it.
1951451 1953662 I'll probably be next.
1953704 1954955 We have each other.
1955330 1957875 Everything else is background noise.
1958959 1960752 You are exceptional.
1968468 1969720 My turn.
1971597 1975058 My parents' publisher dropped them,<br />and they're in debt up to their ears.
1975100 1975934 That's terrible.
1975976 1978395 And they need to borrow<br />from my trust fund.
1978437 1979938 How much?
1979980 1982191 Almost a million.
1982774 1984359 That's almost all of it.
1984401 1986695 This is where you say,<br />"Everything else is background noise."
1986737 1987654 Amy, if you're laid off...
1987946 1989198 and I'm laid off...
1989239 1990365 I said I'd do it.
1990407 1991658 Without talking to me?
1991700 1993285 -Well, it's...<br />-Your call.
1993327 1994912 ...their money, technically.
1999333 2001001 You know what? You're right.
2001627 2003629 Everything else<br />is just background noise.
2012596 2013597 Hey.
2017726 2018894 More games?
2018936 2020562 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.
2021772 2023232 What's the laptop for?
2024316 2025317 Laptop-ing.
2027569 2028487 I see.
2028529 2031532 You can give your parents $879,000<br />without talking to me...
2032074 2034701 but God forbid I buy a video game<br />without getting your permission.
2034743 2035786 You are spending a lot.
2035827 2038080 You don't trust me.<br />You don't trust my judgment.
2038121 2039665 You certainly don't trust my intention.
2039706 2040666 What are you talking about?
2040707 2042334 That's the basic tenet<br />of a prenup, isn't it?
2042376 2044628 Why are you throwing that<br />in my face again?
2044670 2046213 Because it's easy to throw.
2046255 2047047 Nick, I don't get it.
2047089 2050425 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2050467 2053554 The nagging shrew.<br />The controlling bitch.
2053594 2055973 I'm not that person. I'm your wife.
2056014 2057181 I'm sorry.
2057224 2059560 I just don't know how to do this.<br />I've never not had a job.
2059601 2061603 I flipped burgers, I painted houses.
2061645 2063647 You'll get another job.
2068068 2069277 Hi, Go.
2071029 2072781 What? Hold on. What?
2072822 2074241 -And suddenly...<br />-Slow down, what is it?
2074283 2076284 ...I knew everything<br />was about to get worse.
2076326 2077911 Okay, tell me what's wrong.
2105272 2106773 -Bless you, Nick.<br />-Father.
2107441 2108859 Hey, Tom. Mayor!
2108901 2110152 Nick, good to see you.
2110194 2111195 Good to see you.
2111236 2112487 Hey, guys, hey.
2114907 2116408 -Jodie.<br />-Nick.
2118118 2119745 Oh, we'll find her.
2134718 2136428 You look like hammered shit.
2136470 2138138 Thank you.
2146230 2147689 You ever see that guy<br />in the glasses before?
2148607 2151360 Don't worry. We videotape everybody<br />that comes in and out of these things.
2151401 2153195 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...
2153237 2154279 Do-gooders?
2154321 2155531 Freaks.
2155572 2157533 Hey, I meant to ask you.
2157574 2159034 Noelle Hawthorne?
2159910 2161620 She lives on your street.<br />Amy's best friend.
2162746 2164081 I've never heard the name<br />Noelle Hawthorne.
2164122 2166291 She and her husband have triplets.
2166333 2167209 Oh.
2167626 2170462 Yeah, we might say hi to them<br />on the street.
2170838 2173006 But "best friend"? No.
2173549 2174758 Excuse me, one sec.
2179054 2181139 He acted like<br />Noelle was a complete stranger.
2181181 2182266 Of course he did.
2182641 2183934 Look, these two are yours.
2183976 2186353 Oh, look. He's being a good guy...
2186395 2188313 so everybody can see him<br />being a good guy.
2188355 2190148 You really don't like him, do you?
2190190 2191692 What's to like?
2213380 2217009 This mailbox is currently full.<br />Press one to--
2217050 2220429 Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.<br />My name's Shawna Kelly.
2220679 2223390 I am so sorry for your troubles.
2223432 2224349 Thank you. That's kind.
2224391 2225809 Are you remembering to eat?
2225851 2226977 Well, a lot of cold cuts.
2227019 2231190 I'm gonna fix you up<br />my world-famous chicken Frito pie.
2231231 2232733 That's very kind and very unnecessary.
2232774 2234401 You have to keep your strength.
2234943 2235903 Would you...
2236820 2238697 say, "Chicken Frito pie!"
2242910 2244203 You know what?
2245454 2246830 Would you delete that picture for me?
2246872 2248749 -It's a nice photo.<br />-I know it is.
2248790 2250209 But just do me a favor.
2250250 2252002 Will you?
2252044 2254963 Would you go ahead<br />and please delete that picture?
2255005 2255672 You just press...
2256048 2257549 What is wrong with you?
2257591 2258884 Could you please not<br />share that with anyone?
2258926 2262262 I will share it with whomever I please.
2266058 2267434 -Dude.<br />-Yeah?
2267476 2268810 Marybeth is pissed.
2269520 2270312 Why?
2273190 2274775 Marybeth?
2274816 2278237 It's like you're the goddamn<br />Homecoming King.
2280656 2283116 It was important to my mother<br />that I be polite...
2283158 2285077 I be considerate, I be a gentleman.
2285118 2286828 It looked like you were having fun.
2286870 2289122 I am in a nightmare!
2289831 2292251 All I'm trying to do is be nice...
2292292 2296004 to the people who are<br />volunteering to help find Amy.
2297965 2299716 You're right.
2300592 2302553 And I'm sorry.
2304555 2308183 My God, this place literally<br />smells like feces.
2319152 2322489 In your searches,<br />did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?
2322531 2323949 No.
2325075 2326785 How about a brand new Stratocaster?
2326827 2327953 No, nothing like that.
2328662 2330747 Well, all right.
2335752 2338797 How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.
2338839 2340132 No, it's nowhere near that.
2340174 2341258 Okay.
2341717 2343135 -Kibble?<br />-Excuse me?
2343177 2345262 He asked me to feed his cat.
2345304 2346513 I saw some in the pantry.
2346847 2351602 Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?<br />Noelle Hawthorne!
2351643 2353228 I know y'all are in there!
2353270 2357774 Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne<br />and her children back out to the street?
2358650 2360736 Detective Boney!
2360777 2364615 Just remind her<br />it is a possible crime scene.
2373332 2378170 Look at that pie-eating grin,<br />from a guy whose wife is missing.
2383967 2385552 -How are you doing?<br />-Terrific.
2387304 2388805 How's Marybeth?
2388847 2390682 She's a wreck.
2390724 2392184 And you?
2392809 2394436 Awesome.
2394478 2395437 Hey...
2395479 2397064 have you told me everything?
2397314 2398273 Of course.
2398315 2399274 Everything?
2399316 2400484 Why would you even ask me that?
2400526 2404696 Ever since you walked into The Bar that<br />morning Amy went missing, you seem...
2405989 2406990 -off.<br />-I am off.
2408033 2411370 Everybody's examining me<br />and projecting their shit on me.
2411411 2414831 All I want is to come over here,<br />have a beer with you...
2414873 2416208 and not be judged.
2416250 2417751 Can we do that?
2418836 2420170 Of course.
2421547 2423549 You know what I keep thinking?
2423590 2424633 If Mom were here?
2424675 2428095 Yeah. Like I'm 12.
2429555 2432349 Nick, Mom would fix it.
2439565 2442776 I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.
2445696 2448031 -Love you.<br />-Love you.
2452369 2454413 So, here's a strange, new sentence.
2454454 2457916 I am a Missourian.
2464715 2466091 Bye, Dad.
2468010 2471471 No money, no jobs, no prospects.
2471513 2473682 And then, we heard from Go.
2473724 2475642 Mama Maureen...
2475684 2478520 Stage 4 breast cancer.
2480689 2483525 So, we moved to Missouri.
2483567 2485194 I don't mind.
2485235 2488405 I just wish he'd asked.
2500083 2502544 Nick is happy to be home.
2502586 2505088 But I don't know<br />if he's happy I'm with him.
2506590 2509843 I feel like something<br />he loaded by mistake.
2509885 2513055 Something to be jettisoned,<br />if necessary.
2513096 2515307 Something disposable.
2517142 2519770 I feel like I could disappear.
2563772 2565774 Oh, my God!
2565816 2567776 -I saw you on TV.<br />-Okay.
2567818 2569486 -It's so crazy.<br />-Yeah, I know.
2569528 2571738 -She just vanished?<br />-She's just gone.
2571780 2573615 -I've been so worried about you.<br />-Where have you been?
2573657 2575492 I called you a hundred times.<br />You gotta pick up your phone!
2575534 2576577 Rehearsals.
2576618 2577661 What?
2577703 2578996 Godspell.
2580831 2582416 My sister's asleep in the other room.
2582457 2583584 I needed to see you.
2583625 2585294 I know this is a bad idea.
2585335 2586837 Can you at least tell me you love me?
2586879 2590632 I do love you, but we have<br />to be really careful right now.
2590674 2591925 I've been so scared.
2591967 2593177 Between rehearsals?
2593218 2594970 You told me<br />I needed to have my own life.
2595012 2596513 I know.
2596555 2597806 We need to stop.
2597848 2599016 I need you.
2600142 2601977 Touch me.
2605397 2608025 Stop it. Come here.
2609401 2611111 Sit down.
2611153 2612487 Okay.
2612529 2616617 Did you, by any chance,<br />tell anybody anything about us?
2616658 2618160 Even in texting, or on Facebook.
2618202 2620996 Facebook? I use the disposable phone.
2621038 2622956 You buy my presents in cash.<br />I'm not stupid, Nick.
2622998 2625876 I know, sweetie.<br />Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office?
2625918 2629338 I don't know. Maybe.<br />They better be mine.
2629379 2630339 Sweetheart, think.
2630380 2632841 I don't know. I'd have to check<br />my red panty inventory.
2632883 2635511 Andie, I need you<br />to take this seriously, okay?
2635552 2637346 This is the last time<br />we're gonna see each other, until...
2637387 2638847 Until when?
2639389 2640849 Until it's safe.
2640891 2642476 You were going to get a divorce.
2642518 2644686 Never say that out loud again.
2644728 2647397 Okay. I'm sorry.
2648273 2649233 I don't wanna fight.
2651276 2652861 I just wanna be with you.
2652903 2654071 Andie, please...
2654905 2656573 That's all I want.
2657908 2658992 I can't.
2661328 2663580 It's our last time together.
2663622 2665666 Let's make the most of it.
2672422 2675759 Real quick, but then you have to go.
2678595 2681390 My husband has come undone.
2681431 2684393 We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...
2684434 2687145 but as it turns out, we couldn't.
2690440 2692192 It means a lot that you came.
2693360 2694736 We took a hit on the brownstone...
2694778 2697114 and I used the last of my trust fund<br />to buy him a bar.
2697865 2700117 So far, it's just costing money.
2704329 2708125 Nick uses me for sex when he wants.
2711295 2713797 Otherwise, I don't exist.
2715048 2717134 We should go to Outback tonight.
2717176 2718427 That would be nice.
2718468 2721555 Last night, I went from desperate<br />to pathetic.
2722472 2725642 I became someone I don't even like.
2725684 2727477 The kind of woman I used to mock.
2727895 2729605 You're out so much.
2729646 2731982 -I know.<br />-Stay home.
2732024 2734359 -I can't, I'm already late.<br />-Then, can I come?
2734401 2736195 You would hate it.
2736236 2739489 It's a bunch<br />of my dorky high school friends.
2740490 2743368 Do our code. No bullshit.
2743827 2746205 I thought<br />we weren't gonna be that couple.
2752711 2754546 Okay, bye.
2756215 2759176 -Hey, I've been thinking.<br />-Yeah?
2759218 2760594 Something positive.
2762012 2763055 Maybe it's time.
2764348 2766183 Now is literally the worst time.
2766225 2767267 It would be a new start for us.
2767684 2770395 And for me,<br />I would have a real purpose here.
2770437 2771647 A child is not a hobby.
2771688 2772689 Not a hobby.
2773690 2774900 An inspiration.
2775442 2778570 We could have had this fight<br />four hours ago. I'm late.
2778612 2779863 I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.
2779905 2783325 You really wanna be the couple<br />that has a baby to save their marriage?
2783367 2784368 "Save"?
2784868 2787037 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!
2787079 2789248 -And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br />-Yeah!
2789289 2791834 You're a fucking coward.
2791875 2793752 No, it can't go on like this.
2793794 2794837 Really?
2794878 2796380 -I won't.<br />-You won't?
2796421 2798757 You won't?<br />Why, it's not good enough for you?
2798799 2799716 It's not even close!
2799758 2801885 You stupid bitch!
2802469 2805430 What scared me<br />wasn't that he'd pushed me.
2805472 2809309 What scared me was how much<br />he wanted to hurt me more.
2809643 2811728 What scared me<br />was that I'd finally realized...
2812729 2816400 I am frightened of my own husband.
2828287 2829788 You want me to call for backup?
2829830 2831915 Nah, I'll protect you.
2839673 2841091 Jesus.
2846138 2848807 They ought to burn this place down.
2849266 2850934 Seems like folks are trying.
2856440 2858734 You really think this is anything?
2858775 2860944 Cross it off the list.
2872039 2873749 Hey, Jason.
2873790 2875334 What's up, Rhonda?
2875375 2877628 "...and dedicated to the proposition<br />that all men..."
2878712 2881215 -Have you seen this girl around here?<br />-Why do you ask?
2881465 2883300 She was reported missing.
2886470 2888347 "...and so dedicated, can long endure."
2888388 2890307 Yeah. I remember her.
2890349 2892476 What did she want?<br />Weed, pills?
2894144 2895145 She wanted a gun.
2895395 2897439 I told her it's not my thing.
2897481 2900484 I felt bad, though.<br />She seemed really desperate.
2900526 2904112 She said it needed to be small,<br />so she could keep it close.
2904154 2905989 Are you sure this is her?
2906031 2908158 You don't forget a girl like that<br />in here.
2909159 2910661 She was all in pink.
2910702 2913247 It was Valentine's Day.
2916208 2918961 For Valentine's Day,<br />I thought I'd buy a gun.
2919002 2921588 That is how crazy I've become.
2922673 2926802 Nick wants me gone<br />but he won't ask for a divorce.
2926844 2930973 In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,<br />his only line of credit.
2931014 2932516 The bitch with the prenup.
2934351 2936687 I could go home to my parents...
2936728 2939147 but I'd have to tell them the truth.
2939189 2943026 And I don't even know<br />if I believe the truth.
2943068 2945863 Can I really think Nick would hurt me?
2946488 2948866 I'm being paranoid. Crazy.
2950200 2950868 It's just...
2952160 2954705 I'd sleep better with a gun.
2965591 2967009 Oh, shit.
2967050 2970679 Wake up, baby.<br />My sister's gonna come out here.
2975058 2977269 -Sorry to rush you.<br />-It's okay.
2979229 2980731 -Here. Let me help you.<br />-Okay.
2980772 2982858 Just get that.
2985527 2987029 Be very careful.
2987863 2988864 I'm all right.
2988906 2991491 Here you go.
2991533 2993410 Promise me we'll talk every day.
2993452 2994703 Okay, we will.
2994745 2997456 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.
2998248 2999333 Don't go crazy.
2999374 3000626 Okay.
3005047 3008383 You fucking idiot.
3008425 3012262 You fucking asshole!<br />You fucking lied to my fucking face!
3013764 3015307 I'm sorry.
3017100 3018060 How old is she?
3018435 3019645 She's in her early 20s.
3020562 3021396 How long?
3022105 3024900 -A year and a half.<br />-You lied to me for over a year?
3024942 3026610 If I told you,<br />you would have made me stop.
3026652 3028237 It's so fucking small.
3028278 3031240 You're a liar and a cheat!<br />You're just like Dad!
3031281 3032574 How did you even meet her?
3032616 3033825 She's one of my students.
3035077 3036745 I thought writers hated clichés.
3036787 3037621 I'm not a writer.
3037663 3039915 "Boo-hoo, I got laid off.<br />I guess I'll fuck a teenager."
3039957 3042751 It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br />no idea how shitty it was with Amy...
3042793 3044711 how fucking terrible she made me feel.
3044753 3047923 Flyover Boy.<br />I would get knots in my stomach...
3047965 3049800 just coming home,<br />knowing she would be sitting there...
3049842 3051969 dissatisfied, before I even<br />walked in the fucking door.
3052010 3053428 This is so bad.
3053470 3055556 If anybody finds out,<br />you're totally fucked.
3055597 3058225 Boney found a pair of panties<br />in my office...
3058267 3059810 where, occasionally, Andie and I...
3060269 3061395 I don't know what the fuck it means.
3061436 3062604 Are they Super-Twat's?
3062646 3064731 Her name is Andie.
3064773 3066275 She's not entirely sure.
3066316 3067985 So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...
3068026 3069444 who isn't sure<br />where she leaves her undies?
3069486 3071738 If they're not Andie's,<br />that means that they're Amy's...
3071780 3073490 and she left them there for me to find.
3073532 3077286 Nick, I was scared for you before,<br />and now, I'm fucking petrified.
3077327 3079621 We're having a vigil tonight<br />for your missing wife...
3079663 3082791 and this morning, you're kissing<br />your college girlfriend goodbye!
3082833 3084001 Can you imagine?
3084626 3087963 Have you watched television lately?
3088005 3091008 Cable news is all over your shit.
3091633 3093468 I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?
3093510 3095804 His wife's nowhere to be found...
3095846 3099516 and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.<br />Cute pic, huh?
3099558 3102019 -Who is that?<br />-Some fucking tragedy groupie.
3102060 3103979 -Who the fuck is that?<br />-I don't know.
3104021 3105147 She was trying to give me a casserole.
3105189 3108317 On the show today<br />we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt...
3108358 3110903 patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.
3111195 3114698 Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider<br />defending Nick Dunne?
3114740 3115866 Well, let me just say...
3115908 3118660 as always, Ellen,<br />thank you for such a warm welcome.
3118702 3120245 But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.
3120537 3123040 Listen, just because this guy<br />isn't walking around weeping...
3123081 3124499 that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.
3124541 3127878 Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath<br />is a lack of empathy.
3127920 3129880 But the truth is,<br />you'd have to be a sociopath...
3130380 3132174 to behave normally in this situation...
3132216 3134968 because it's the most<br />abnormal situation in the world.
3135010 3137679 Tanner, are you trying to tell me<br />that this photo...
3137721 3139973 is remotely in the realm<br />of acceptable behavior?
3140015 3142684 I'm so sick<br />of being picked apart by women.
3144061 3145938 You need to hire Tanner Bolt.
3148023 3148815 I don't deserve this.
3148857 3150734 Innocent until proven guilty.
3150776 3153153 That's exactly what you deserve.
3153195 3154738 Go home, Nick.
3180722 3182140 Hey, buddy.
3198031 3199825 I can't believe<br />we haven't arrested this guy.
3199867 3201827 We're not gonna arrest anybody...
3201869 3203370 just because some blonde dunce says so.
3203787 3206290 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3206582 3209918 One, I am conducting an investigation,<br />not a witch-hunt.
3209960 3211879 And, two,<br />don't talk to me that way, ever.
3211920 3213213 She was trying to buy a gun.
3213255 3215424 We don't know who<br />or what was scaring her, Gil.
3215465 3216383 Give me the update.
3216967 3219595 No drug angles panned out yet,<br />so cross that off the list.
3219636 3221597 I talked to the nurses<br />who care for Nick's father.
3221638 3224349 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten,<br />so cross that off the list.
3224391 3225559 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
3225601 3229021 So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br />like the 4th of July.
3229062 3230355 -Whoa.<br />-Yeah.
3230397 3231523 The blood is profuse.
3231565 3233775 It is Amy's, type B,<br />and we should have DNA soon.
3233817 3234902 Thoughts on a weapon?
3234943 3236862 Trajectory indicates blunt force.
3236904 3239239 Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
3239823 3243076 She fell there,<br />but I doubt she got back up.
3243118 3244536 Amy's medical records come in?
3244578 3246580 No, we'll have them later tonight.
3248165 3249583 My wife says he's a killer.
3249833 3252169 Well, if Tiffany says...
3277778 3278779 Hey.
3279112 3280113 Hey.
3284535 3285536 Thank you all for coming out.
3287371 3288997 Hey Donnie, how are you?
3289039 3292376 Rich, thank you so much.
3299675 3300676 Hey.
3307724 3311311 Thank you, folks.<br />Thank you for being here tonight.
3311353 3313146 It just means the world to our family.
3313689 3315148 And to Amy.
3315732 3317734 As you all know...
3318569 3321864 my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...
3321905 3323407 disappeared three days ago.
3323991 3327536 And I want to implore anyone<br />who has any information at all...
3327578 3330497 please come forward. Help us.
3330539 3331456 So hot.
3331498 3332875 He is so creepy.
3332916 3336378 I wanna say something, because I think<br />some of you might be wondering...
3336420 3338338 and are too polite to ask.
3338839 3341925 I had nothing to do<br />with the disappearance of my wife.
3342509 3344469 I'm cooperating with the police.
3344511 3346555 I haven't hired a lawyer.
3346597 3347723 I have nothing to hide.
3349016 3351518 Amy is my soul mate.
3351768 3353061 She is brilliant...
3353604 3356690 she's charming, and wise.
3357024 3358734 I love you, Amy.
3362863 3363947 Asshole.
3365282 3367201 I love my wife...
3367576 3368785 so much.
3371288 3375626 And I may not behave for the cameras<br />the way they want me to...
3376043 3379254 and if they wanna punish me for that,<br />that's okay.
3379296 3383008 But I just wanna ask you in the media,<br />please, harass me...
3383050 3386094 but don't harass<br />the people of this town.
3386136 3388180 If you need to mock somebody, mock me.
3388222 3389431 Nick!
3389473 3391141 But please don't turn this investigation<br />into a circus.
3391642 3393227 Where's your wife, Nick?
3393268 3394770 Let the police do their jobs.
3395229 3396813 What did you do to your pregnant wife?
3398649 3399900 Did you tell them that, Nick?
3399942 3401985 Did you tell them<br />Amy was six weeks pregnant?
3405739 3407908 Thank you for your support tonight.<br />Let's find Amy.
3410077 3411495 Go ahead,<br />if you guys wanna say something.
3415791 3417167 Gil, go, go.
3419503 3420629 Nick, where are you going?
3420671 3422256 Stop him!
3422297 3424508 No questions right now. Thank you.
3427010 3428554 Why are you running away?
3429638 3431056 Don't run.
3432140 3433141 Everybody, stay back.
3437938 3440107 Guys, come on. You know better.
3440148 3442609 Get off the grass, get down to the curb.
3442651 3444069 -Hey, Gil...<br />-On it.
3444111 3445153 All right.
3445195 3446989 All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.
3447030 3448323 Hello?
3449074 3450617 Hello?
3450659 3451493 Fuck.
3451535 3453036 You scared me. Want a drink?
3453078 3454580 Did you know she was pregnant?
3454621 3456748 I told you,<br />Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.
3456790 3457833 She doesn't even know Amy.
3458500 3459918 They look like pretty good friends<br />to me.
3467676 3471096 Look, I don't know.<br />But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
3471138 3472347 We have her medical records coming.
3472389 3474266 -Good.<br />-So, let's talk while we wait.
3474308 3476518 Let's start over here.<br />The scene of the crime.
3476560 3479438 You see, we've seen dozens<br />of home invasions.
3479479 3481440 Dozens and dozens.
3481481 3483692 This area right here, it looked wrong<br />from the second we saw it.
3483734 3486904 The whole thing looked staged.<br />Watch this.
3488822 3492242 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3492659 3494411 I don't know.<br />What do you want me to say?
3494453 3496079 Did you do any housekeeping<br />the day your wife went missing?
3496121 3497080 No.
3497122 3499374 Because our guys did a luminol test.
3499416 3502085 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3502127 3504379 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.<br />A lot.
3504421 3505380 Oh, my God.
3505422 3506757 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.
3506798 3509259 Wait a second.<br />Why would they mop up the blood...
3509301 3510886 if they're trying to stage<br />a crime scene?
3510928 3513680 No blood and no body<br />suggests kidnapping.
3513722 3516141 It tells us,<br />look at people outside the house.
3516183 3517601 Like these homeless you keep mentioning.
3517643 3520729 A pool of blood and no body<br />suggests homicide.
3520771 3522773 It tells us to look at people<br />inside the house.
3522814 3525526 -Which is what we're doing here, Nick.<br />-I see.
3525567 3528529 So, how was your marriage, Nick?<br />Because right now, all we got is Noelle.
3528570 3530113 She says, "Not good."
3530155 3531657 Gil, what do you and your wife<br />argue about?
3531698 3533825 -What pisses you off?<br />-Money, lack thereof.
3533867 3535619 Me and my ex, it's the same.
3535661 3538997 I mention that because<br />we got a look at your finances, Nick.
3539039 3541750 $117,000 in credit card debt.
3541792 3543752 -What?<br />-I pulled up some of the merchandise.
3543794 3545796 There are these fun little splurges.
3545838 3547381 I didn't buy any of this stuff.
3547422 3548549 I don't even golf!
3548590 3549925 I do! You bought great clubs.
3549967 3551260 I like the robot dog.
3551301 3553262 This is identity theft!<br />This is a felony!
3553303 3554263 We need to find out who did this!
3554304 3556056 All right.<br />Let's talk about life insurance.
3556098 3558642 Because in April,<br />you bumped up Amy's life insurance...
3558684 3559685 to $1.2 million.
3559726 3562104 Yes, I did. That was her idea.<br />She wanted me to.
3562145 3563313 You filed the paperwork.
3563355 3564565 Because she told me to!
3565399 3566316 Hold on a sec.
3566358 3568151 Yeah? Okay.
3570070 3571238 For sure?
3571655 3572823 All right.
3576910 3577870 She was pregnant.
3581999 3583625 This is insane.
3583667 3586170 So, my question becomes--
3586211 3589131 I don't want to talk<br />to you again, ever...
3589173 3590340 without a lawyer.
3598682 3599683 Margo!
3610569 3611570 Hey.
3613947 3616366 Just hold on a second. Let me finish.
3616408 3617326 Nick?
3617367 3620162 I hear you, I hear you.<br />I was as surprised as--
3620204 3624041 I know you're upset.<br />I had no idea she was pregnant.
3624458 3627586 Listen, I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't--
3630088 3632216 You want to know the truth?
3632257 3634635 The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.
3637054 3639097 Well, I'm as surprised as--
3640432 3642226 You told me you didn't want kids.
3643227 3644603 I was trying to put a good face on.
3644645 3646522 Then, suddenly,<br />you've got a pregnant wife.
3646563 3647898 That's a problem for you.
3647940 3651026 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3651068 3652528 Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!
3652569 3653904 You have to fucking talk to me!
3656573 3660619 I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids<br />because she didn't want me to.
3660661 3662871 Because it would have just been<br />another reason for you to hate her.
3662913 3664790 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just--
3664831 3667042 -Lie to me?<br />-I wanted kids!
3667084 3669253 When we first moved here,<br />I went to a fertility clinic!
3669294 3670963 -It didn't work?<br />-I did my part!
3671004 3672047 Masturbate.
3672089 3673799 When it came time for Amy to do her thing,<br />all of a sudden it was like...
3673841 3675384 "Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."
3675425 3677427 Now, who would believe you?
3678595 3679805 All right.
3689439 3691233 This is a letter from the clinic...
3691275 3693735 notifying me<br />that they're gonna destroy my sample...
3693777 3695779 unless I contact them.
3697030 3698574 So, I gave it to Amy.
3698615 3701618 The next day, I saw it in the trash.
3701660 3703245 But you were already with Andie<br />by then, right?
3703287 3706123 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3706164 3710335 A year ago, Amy being pregnant<br />would have been the best thing ever!
3716884 3718760 "When your poor Amy has a cold,<br />this dessert just--"
3718802 3720179 This is the clue you couldn't solve.
3720220 3721346 Yeah.
3723056 3726435 A letter from Desi.<br />That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
3726476 3728854 It was the fucking rich guy<br />who would do anything for her.
3728896 3730856 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3730898 3731857 Your prenup?
3732232 3735194 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3735235 3737029 I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!
3739907 3743035 I love you no matter what.
3743076 3744453 But you need to tell me.
3744494 3745913 Tell you what?
3746747 3748373 What are you asking me?
3749958 3753128 Are you asking me<br />if I killed my wife, Go?
3753587 3755672 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3755714 3758133 I would never ask you that!
3762095 3763096 Margo!
3775901 3778111 Don't walk on the glass.
3779821 3782449 You have no clue, do you?
3800259 3801844 Why was he here that night?
3803470 3806306 His wife is missing. Why come here?
3806348 3807266 Who cares?
3807558 3808809 Rhonda, we got this.
3808851 3810352 Let's make the arrest.
3810394 3812479 Do you know how hard it is<br />to make a murder case without a body?
3812521 3813438 No.
3813480 3815649 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3815691 3818569 So, I want one last thing.
3818610 3819444 What's that?
3821238 3823532 I want a body.
3824700 3829121 Picture me.<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.
3829162 3830789 Be careful.
3835335 3839756 I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished," I mean "had."
3844303 3845304 Fuck.
3847264 3850100 It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.
3851351 3853520 So, open the door...
3853562 3854938 Punish. Wood. Beach.
3854980 3857482 ...and look alive.
3860611 3863197 Punish. Wood.
3864364 3865949 Wood.
3898065 3900776 I will practice believing<br />my husband loves me...
3900817 3903237 and will love this baby.
3903904 3907533 That this child<br />might really save our marriage.
3908408 3909868 But I could be wrong.
3916041 3917960 Because sometimes...
3918961 3921171 the way he looks at me...
3922256 3924007 I think...
3924049 3925133 man of my dreams...
3927052 3929137 father of my child...
3929930 3933934 this man of mine may kill me.
3935310 3937312 He may truly...
3938230 3938981 kill me.
3941942 3942818 WTF?
3967885 3970470 I am so much happier now that I'm dead.
3975517 3977102 Technically, "missing."
3977936 3979605 Soon to be presumed dead.
3981315 3982441 Gone.
3983400 3986653 And my lazy, lying, cheating,<br />oblivious husband...
3986695 3989990 will go to prison for my murder.
3991283 3993827 Nick Dunne took my pride<br />and my dignity...
3993869 3996371 and my hope and my money.
3996413 4000000 He took and took from me<br />until I no longer existed.
4000042 4001460 That's murder.
4001502 4004296 Let the punishment fit the crime.
4004880 4007883 To fake a convincing murder,<br />you have to have discipline.
4012095 4015098 You befriend a local idiot.
4018644 4021813 Harvest the details<br />of her humdrum life.
4022189 4025776 And cram her with stories<br />about your husband's violent temper.
4026902 4029196 Secretly create some money troubles.
4029446 4032616 Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.
4035244 4037454 With the help of the unwitting...
4037496 4039498 bump up your life insurance.
4041208 4044378 Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.
4044419 4047714 Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.
4048173 4052803 You need to package yourself so that<br />people will truly mourn your loss.
4052845 4055806 And America loves pregnant women.
4056139 4059142 As if it's so hard to spread your legs.
4059184 4060477 You know what's hard?
4060978 4062938 Faking a pregnancy.
4062980 4065148 First, drain your toilet.
4066859 4069611 Invite pregnant idiot into your home...
4069653 4072155 and ply her with lemonade.
4077327 4079496 Steal pregnant idiot's urine.
4081707 4083208 Voilà.
4083250 4087212 A pregnancy is now part<br />of your legal medical record.
4093719 4095053 Happy anniversary.
4097723 4100475 Wait for your clueless husband...
4100517 4102394 to start his day.
4103854 4105314 Off he goes.
4105354 4107524 And the clock is ticking.
4108692 4111194 Meticulously stage your crime scene...
4111862 4115866 with just enough mistakes<br />to raise the specter of doubt.
4117283 4119243 You need to bleed.
4119578 4120287 A lot.
4121205 4122872 A lot, a lot.
4126210 4128045 A head wound kind of bleed.
4128712 4131215 A crime scene kind of bleed.
4134218 4136345 You need to clean poorly...
4136386 4137220 like he would.
4138095 4140599 Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.
4141225 4143810 And leave a little something behind.
4144478 4146229 A fire in July?
4147773 4148857 And because you're you...
4148899 4150149 you don't stop there.
4150567 4152778 You need a diary.
4152819 4155738 Minimum, 300 entries<br />on the Nick and Amy story.
4156406 4158700 Start with the fairy tale early days.
4158742 4161036 Those are true. And they're crucial.
4161078 4163080 You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.
4163412 4166041 After that, you invent.
4166082 4167042 The spending.
4167084 4168877 The abuse. The fear.
4168919 4171880 The threat of violence.
4171921 4173881 And Nick thought he was the writer.
4174591 4175884 Burn it just the right amount.
4177719 4179595 Make sure the cops will find it.
4184600 4187645 Finally, honor tradition<br />with a very special treasure hunt.
4190232 4193026 And if I get everything right,<br />the world will hate Nick...
4193068 4195779 for killing his beautiful,<br />pregnant wife.
4195821 4198448 And after all the outrage,<br />when I'm ready...
4198490 4200450 I'll go out on the water<br />with a handful of pills...
4200492 4203036 and a pocket full of stones.
4203078 4205873 And when they find my body,<br />they'll know...
4205914 4209209 Nick Dunne dumped his beloved<br />like garbage.
4209251 4211587 And she floated down<br />past all the other...
4211628 4214965 abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.
4216341 4218302 Then, Nick will die, too.
4219178 4221054 Nick and Amy will be gone.
4221096 4223223 But, then, we never really existed.
4223265 4226476 Nick loved a girl<br />I was pretending to be.
4226518 4227269 "Cool Girl."
4227978 4231815 Men always use that<br />as their defining compliment.
4231857 4232816 "She's a cool girl."
4233984 4235110 Cool Girl is hot.
4235152 4236570 Cool Girl is game.
4236612 4237529 Cool Girl is fun.
4237946 4240449 Cool Girl never gets angry at her man.
4240490 4243118 She only smiles in a chagrined,<br />loving manner...
4243785 4246747 and then presents her mouth for fucking.
4246788 4248790 She likes what he likes.
4248832 4252294 So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster<br />who loves fetish manga.
4253337 4256632 If he likes Girls Gone Wild,<br />she's a mall babe...
4256673 4260469 who talks football<br />and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.
4260511 4264097 When I met Nick Dunne,<br />I knew he wanted Cool Girl.
4264139 4266808 And for him, I'll admit,<br />I was willing to try.
4266850 4268852 I wax-stripped my pussy raw.
4269520 4272648 I drank canned beer<br />watching Adam Sandler movies.
4272898 4275692 I ate cold pizza<br />and remained a size two.
4275734 4277694 I blew him semi-regularly.
4279029 4280364 I lived in the moment.
4280656 4283200 I was fucking game.
4283825 4285869 I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.
4286703 4289998 Nick teased out of me<br />things I didn't know existed.
4290040 4293335 A lightness, a humor, an ease.
4293377 4296296 But I made him smarter. Sharper.
4296338 4299967 I inspired him to rise to my level.
4300008 4303762 I forged the man of my dreams.
4306098 4309017 We were happy pretending<br />to be other people.
4309059 4310894 We were the happiest couple we knew.
4312521 4315524 And what's the point of being together<br />if you're not the happiest?
4316191 4318402 But Nick got lazy.
4318443 4320654 He became someone<br />I did not agree to marry.
4320696 4323866 He actually expected me<br />to love him unconditionally.
4324533 4329037 Then he dragged me, penniless,<br />to the navel of this great country...
4329079 4333041 and found himself a newer,<br />younger, bouncier...
4333083 4334084 Cool Girl.
4336420 4340591 You think I'd let him destroy me<br />and end up happier than ever?
4341091 4342759 No fucking way.
4343135 4344928 He doesn't get to win.
4355272 4359234 My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,<br />Missouri guy.
4361653 4364114 He needed to learn.
4364823 4367451 Grown-ups work for things.
4367993 4369953 Grown-ups pay.
4371330 4373916 Grown-ups suffer consequences.
4377419 4378629 Wait.
4379004 4381798 I need 20 seconds where you<br />don't judge me, interrupt me...
4381840 4383467 or get angry.
4384927 4386470 Okay.
4390432 4392392 Is that all the stuff<br />from the credit cards?
4392434 4395604 Where do you store goodies<br />for anniversary five?
4395646 4396438 Wood.
4396480 4399608 -Woodshed.<br />-Yeah, my woodshed.
4399650 4402152 That fucking bitch.
4403987 4405322 -I thought--<br />-It's all right.
4405364 4406823 I would have, too.
4410285 4411495 What's that present?
4411537 4413288 I don't know.
4413330 4415290 Let's find out.
4421880 4425801 "Dear Husband, I know you think<br />you're moving through this world unseen.
4425843 4427261 "Don't believe that for a second.
4427302 4429346 "I know where you've been,<br />and I know where you're going."
4432808 4434852 "For this anniversary,<br />I've arranged a trip.
4434893 4436770 "Follow the river, up, up, up.
4436812 4439523 "Sit back and relax,<br />because you are done."
4439565 4440983 What's "up, up river"?
4441024 4443193 "Up the river." Prison.
4443235 4445153 Fucking crazy bitch.
4445195 4446822 That's what this is.
4446864 4449157 She's framing me for her murder.
4449199 4450492 You married a complete psychopath.
4450534 4452661 The morning of our anniversary...
4452703 4456999 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4457040 4459501 I couldn't fake it for another year,<br />another day.
4459543 4460460 Then what happened?
4460502 4461795 Before I could say anything, she said...
4461837 4465215 "I need you to go somewhere<br />and really think about our marriage."
4465257 4466508 She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.
4466550 4467843 So you'd have no alibi.
4467885 4470095 She stage-managed me.
4470387 4474057 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4474099 4475642 I went to the beach,<br />I thought about our marriage.
4475684 4477394 I came back<br />and decided I wanted a divorce.
4477436 4478645 And by the time you got home--
4478687 4480230 She was gone.
4480856 4481732 You fuck!
4481773 4483358 She's good.
4484359 4486361 Part of me was relieved...
4486403 4488697 when I thought she was gone.
4493076 4494786 Punch and Judy puppets.
4497789 4500876 Remember, he beats Judy to death<br />and kills that baby.
4500918 4502044 So I'm Punch.
4503045 4505047 We already knew that, Amy,<br />what's your point?
4506215 4509051 Does Missouri have the death penalty?
4535953 4537371 Hey, neighbor.
4538288 4540666 It's been weeks<br />since I had anyone decent next door.
4541291 4543919 Well, I don't know how decent I feel.
4543961 4547089 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast death metal at 4 AM...
4547130 4549132 we're gonna be best friends.
4549174 4551260 All right. Nice meeting you.
4551301 4552886 I'm Greta.
4553512 4554805 I'm Nancy.
4554847 4556807 Are you going to the marina?<br />I could use some creamer.
4556849 4558267 I'm sorry. I can't.
4558308 4559518 I've got work to do.
4559810 4561854 All right. See you around!
4562145 4564064 You will.
4610027 4615240 Come on.<br />Show me that darling Nicky smile.
4617034 4618911 You asshole.
4634384 4635886 Hey.
4638680 4640432 Nancy.
4642726 4644561 Nancy.
4645562 4647773 It's hot again today.
4650067 4651902 So, where are you from?
4652402 4653570 Let me guess.
4656698 4657533 Nebraska.
4659910 4661119 New Orleans.
4664581 4667084 You know, I am an expert oiler.
4667125 4668919 Oh, I just bet you are.
4668961 4671588 Lotions and balms. Ointment.
4672297 4674216 I would hate<br />for y'all to get tan lines.
4674258 4676260 So sweet.
4677094 4679763 Okay. You know where I'll be.
4682641 4685060 I see we have the same taste in men.
4686770 4689022 I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.
4689064 4692109 Least you could do<br />is not keep his secrets for him.
4693151 4694528 Let me guess.
4694570 4698448 He's trying to watch the big game<br />and you just won't shut up.
4698740 4701577 No, you don't seem<br />like much of a talker.
4701618 4702578 I got it.
4702619 4705080 You caught your boy rubbing up<br />on some hot little skank...
4705122 4706832 and he apologized to you<br />by busting you a good one.
4709501 4710294 Worse.
4710627 4711628 Worse?
4712462 4716175 I went to the bar where he works<br />to surprise him.
4716216 4720929 And out he comes with this girl<br />who had no business being in a bar.
4723891 4725893 On the very first night that we met...
4726143 4730314 we walked by a bakery<br />that was having their sugar delivered.
4731148 4733525 And it was in the air, everywhere.
4733567 4735861 A sugar storm.
4735903 4738030 And before he kissed me...
4738071 4740157 he leaned in...
4741658 4743952 and did this.
4754630 4757090 -And guess what.<br />-What?
4757132 4758842 He did the exact same thing with her.
4763096 4766099 That is the most disgusting thing<br />I ever heard.
4766141 4767851 Thank you.
4782616 4784201 Thanks very much.
4790999 4793293 Well, we've gone mainstream.
4808892 4812020 It's an appeals process,<br />so we will attempt to appeal to them.
4812062 4814189 Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?
4816066 4817484 Nick Dunne.
4817526 4819820 I have been sitting by the phone,<br />my friend.
4823282 4824533 I'm sorry.
4824575 4826410 Do you not believe me?
4826451 4829705 No, I believe you.<br />It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
4829746 4833083 I love it. But, for you, it sucks.
4833792 4837087 But you gotta have a grudging respect<br />for your wife at this point, right?
4837129 4838714 -Are you laughing me out of the building?<br />-No!
4838755 4840507 Are you kidding me? I'm in.
4840549 4842009 I'm way in.
4842050 4844678 You came to the right guy.<br />This is what I do, Nick.
4844720 4848140 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.<br />I win the unwinnable cases.
4848182 4849850 $100,000?
4849892 4851435 We'll figure something out.
4851476 4852477 I'll give you a special...
4852519 4855439 "my wife is skilled<br />in the art of vengeance" rate.
4855480 4856523 Okay.
4856565 4858192 So, what's the plan?
4858233 4860110 Well, right now,<br />it's a "he said, she said."
4860152 4862613 -She's telling a better story.<br />-No, Nick.
4862654 4864489 She is telling the perfect story.
4864781 4868076 So, we need to start today<br />to prepare your defense, should we need it.
4868118 4870495 -And if we decide to go with your version of--<br />-The truth.
4871413 4874750 Then we'll need to realign<br />the public's perception of Amy.
4874791 4877044 Make them stop seeing her<br />as America's sweetheart...
4877085 4880422 and see her for what she is,<br />which a mind-fucker of the first degree.
4880839 4884801 Now, that is a huge realignment.<br />We'll need other voices besides yours.
4884843 4887095 There has to be someone out there<br />that she's screwed with in the past.
4887137 4890224 There's a New York guy.<br />O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
4890265 4892643 Eight years ago,<br />she pressed charges against him.
4892684 4894853 That should be easy to find.
4895395 4898774 Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.
4898815 4900400 She said that he stalked her.<br />He's in St. Louis.
4901985 4904238 You go talk to Tommy,<br />and I'll draw up the contract.
4908534 4911537 I told you, you came to the right guy.
4913747 4914957 Apparently.
4924007 4925801 Tommy?
4925843 4927386 Yeah.
4927803 4929763 -Thanks for seeing me.<br />-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4932850 4934560 You're gonna want a drink.
4935102 4936436 Yeah.
4936478 4939273 So, she said you got physical with her.
4939314 4942276 No, dude, she said I raped her.
4942317 4944695 First degree, felony rape.
4945445 4947155 -Did you do it?<br />-Did you do it?
4948323 4950409 I was looking at 30 years to life.
4950951 4952494 -Did you get a trial?<br />-Fuck, no.
4952536 4954746 Do I look like<br />I would do well in the yard?
4954788 4957708 I pled down, man.<br />Sexual assault one, no jail time.
4958125 4959793 -That's something.<br />-Oh, yeah.
4959835 4961253 I've been unemployed<br />for the last eight years...
4961295 4963797 because I have to write "sexual offender"<br />on every job application.
4963839 4966800 I'm on a neighborhood watch list,<br />because I have to register as a predator.
4966842 4970179 I haven't had a date in almost a decade,<br />because if a girl googles me...
4972139 4974057 Could you walk me through what happened?
4974349 4977477 I meet Amy at this party, you know?
4977519 4979146 We click. She's perfect.
4979188 4981523 She's beautiful,<br />she's smart, she's well-read...
4981565 4983859 she's got an ass<br />like a 20-year-old stripper.
4983901 4985694 I think, "What's the catch?"
4985736 4988906 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4989573 4992618 Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?
4992659 4996121 She annexed me.<br />She made me her business.
4996163 4999958 It was just too much.<br />She went out and bought me ties.
5000000 5002211 And we must have gone<br />20 rounds over that.
5002252 5005005 Ties. The whole thing just became--
5005047 5008842 -So, you broke up with her.<br />-No, I just backed away.
5008884 5011678 Gave her some space. No big deal, right?
5011720 5013388 So I thought.
5013430 5015724 Then one night,<br />Amy comes over to my place...
5015766 5018685 with a bottle of bourbon<br />and a bootleg of this band I love.
5018727 5021730 And within two minutes,<br />she's got my pants around my ankles...
5021772 5023357 and she is kneeling down, and--
5023398 5025400 I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.
5025442 5027319 -You had sex?<br />-Yeah, consensual.
5027361 5029446 It was rough,<br />but she was screaming for it.
5029905 5032241 Next morning,<br />there's two cops at my door.
5032574 5035494 Amy has wounds<br />that are consistent with rape.
5035536 5038705 Ligature marks on her wrist,<br />and my semen.
5038747 5042417 It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,<br />and raped her.
5042459 5043919 Me!
5043961 5045712 And then, guess what they find.
5045754 5047798 Headboards of my bed, one on each side.
5048215 5049550 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5049591 5050926 You do know your wife.
5051593 5053428 -Did you ever see her again?<br />-Yeah.
5053470 5054888 On TV, last week, with you.
5055472 5056890 I thought, "There's Amy.
5056932 5060936 "She's graduated from being raped<br />to being murdered."
5064773 5065941 You been watching this, too?
5065983 5067192 Last night's bombshell.
5067234 5068277 We just found out...
5068318 5071154 Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,<br />pregnant when she went missing.
5071655 5074616 Kelly Capitono,<br />this makes me wanna throw up.
5074658 5077619 What is it about a pregnant woman,<br />a woman carrying life inside her...
5077661 5079121 that turns men into animals?
5079162 5080664 Ellen, this is an epidemic.
5080956 5083208 The third leading cause of death<br />among pregnant women...
5083250 5085627 is homicide committed by<br />a boyfriend or husband.
5085669 5088547 Let's not forget about the wife, ever.
5088589 5092634 Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,<br />Noelle Hawthorne.
5092676 5095053 Thanks for being on the show, Noelle.
5095095 5096388 Thank you, Ellen.
5096430 5097931 And let me just say this...
5097973 5101560 Amy would have loved you,<br />and all you do for women.
5101602 5102644 Oh, that's nice.
5102686 5104813 Why don't you tell us<br />about your friend, Noelle?
5104855 5107399 Amy was so nurturing.
5107441 5109818 Oh, I'd love if just once,<br />someone was like...
5109860 5111153 "She was a real rag."
5113655 5116241 She was beautiful and smart and kind.
5116283 5118327 Seems like a rich bitch to me.
5118368 5120996 What do you mean? People love her.
5121038 5123457 I don't know. She seems uppity.
5125167 5127669 Spoiled rich girl,<br />married a cheating asshole.
5127711 5128921 Paid the ultimate price.
5128962 5132424 The only secret was her husband.<br />We never met Nick.
5132466 5134092 He never introduced himself.
5134134 5136512 Why was that, Noelle? Why do you think?
5136553 5137554 I think we know why.
5138347 5140599 Because he had a violent temper.
5140641 5141683 A little harsh.
5141725 5143310 That's life, baby.
5143352 5144645 He knew I'd have<br />seen right through him.
5145854 5147189 Don't get me wrong.
5147231 5149107 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
5149149 5152569 I'm just saying, there are consequences.
5154696 5155697 Fuck, yeah.
5155739 5158158 She was so alone.
5158200 5160118 And she was so innocent.
5160160 5163622 You're a good friend, Noelle.<br />And you're a good friend of the show.
5163664 5164873 Thanks for coming on.
5164915 5166375 Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.
5166416 5168710 Tanner Bolt landed me.
5168752 5172047 I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings<br />on my way home.
5172089 5174049 And, Go...
5174091 5177261 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5177719 5179179 That's just the retainer.
5179555 5183183 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
5183225 5186311 I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house.<br />We will go from there.
5186353 5188105 Thank you.
5188856 5190524 -I love you.<br />-I love you, too.
5190566 5193318 Nick keeps his father,<br />who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.
5193360 5195571 Number of times he visited last year?<br />One.
5195612 5196572 Oh, fuck!
5196613 5199324 His twin sister, Margo,<br />well, she is a peach.
5199366 5201702 These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.
5202286 5204413 Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?
5204454 5205581 What the fuck?
5205622 5208292 Twin siblings often enable and abet.
5208792 5210627 While I never examined Nick,<br />or his sister...
5211420 5213547 they both seem very, very close.
5213881 5215132 It's twin-cest.
5215465 5218177 Disturbingly close, Lauren.
5218218 5220220 And so, we close with a question.
5220262 5221763 What kind of moral rot...
5221805 5226518 allows a beautiful, talented,<br />kind, smart, loving mother...
5226560 5230272 to vanish without<br />the heavens hearing our outraged cries?
5230314 5231356 Can I bum a cigarette?
5231398 5235152 Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about you,<br />and we will not forget.
5235652 5237863 And you know what else we won't forget?
5237905 5240282 Missouri has the death penalty.
5240324 5241491 Amen.
5267351 5269645 I'd like to report<br />some strange activity...
5269686 5273190 near the woodshed<br />on the property of one Margo Dunne.
5314398 5315858 Hey.
5321405 5323532 -Mr. Dunne.<br />-Mr. Collings.
5324533 5327619 I know you.<br />I saw you at the volunteer center.
5327661 5329371 I wanted to help.
5330163 5331874 I hope you don't mind me coming by.
5331915 5335002 I got your address from this letter<br />that you wrote my wife.
5335878 5339381 Amy and I believe<br />in the lost art of letter-writing.
5339423 5343260 I always wondered<br />why you kept in touch after...
5343927 5345220 everything.
5345262 5347681 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5347723 5349892 She was my first serious girlfriend.
5349933 5352728 -Why did you break up?<br />-That's a strange question.
5352769 5354730 Did you treat her bad?<br />Did you cheat on her?
5354771 5355981 That's a rude question.
5356023 5357733 Let me tell you what Amy told me.
5357774 5360736 She dumped you,<br />you completely unraveled.
5360777 5362863 You stalked her, you threatened her...
5362905 5366408 and you attempted suicide in her bed<br />and were institutionalized.
5366450 5370370 Your wife is missing,<br />and you came all this way to tell me this?
5370412 5372623 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5376293 5378128 Mr. Collings.
5380214 5382132 Fuck.
5387763 5390766 ...the missing persons case<br />of Amy Elliott Dunne.
5390807 5394478 She is the beautiful blonde inspiration<br />for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.
5411662 5413872 You're reading that diary again?
5413914 5414957 You know how it ends.
5414998 5417459 It interests me.
5417501 5419086 Hey, Rhonda.
5419127 5421046 "He's gonna kill me." The end.
5421088 5423215 Why did he go to his dad's house<br />to burn it?
5423257 5424383 It's private. There's no one there.
5424424 5427219 Why didn't he make sure<br />it actually burned?
5427261 5430222 Because he tripped the alarm.<br />You were up his ass with a flashlight.
5430264 5432599 The whole thing just feels hinky.
5432641 5434726 Like finding an envelope marked "Clue."
5434768 5435894 You ever hear the expression...
5435936 5437688 "The simplest answer<br />is often the correct one"?
5438480 5440482 Actually, I've never<br />found that to be true.
5440524 5442317 -Good night.<br />-Good night.
5444987 5445988 Hey.
5455455 5457332 Elvis is in Missouri.
5457374 5459501 Thank God. Come on in.
5459543 5461962 First thing you have to understand about Amy,<br />she loves to teach lessons.
5462546 5465007 -Play God.<br />-Yeah, Old Testament God.
5465048 5466091 Okay. Keep talking.
5466133 5467843 She finds out I've been cheating on her<br />with Andie...
5467885 5469469 decides to teach me a lesson.
5469511 5471430 Fakes her own death, frames me for it.
5471471 5473682 Blood in the house, credit cards,<br />life insurance.
5473724 5474933 She does the treasure hunt.
5474975 5476310 Now, the treasure hunt is critical.
5476351 5480022 She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities.<br />Rubbing my nose in it.
5480063 5482107 And she leaves clue number one<br />for the police...
5482149 5483859 which will lead them<br />back to my office...
5483901 5486445 which is a place<br />where Andie and I would often...
5486486 5487821 And she leaves a pair of red panties.
5487863 5489031 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5489072 5490782 -Clue two.<br />-My father's house.
5490824 5493202 Another place where Andie and I<br />would occasionally have relations.
5493243 5494620 -Clue three?<br />-Woodshed.
5494661 5496163 -Also a location...<br />-Oh, my God.
5496205 5497956 -We had limited options.<br />-A hotel.
5497998 5500501 -Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br />-Put it on Andie's credit card.
5500542 5501877 Andie's statement<br />went right to her parents.
5501919 5504463 Nick, Margo, can we head over<br />to the little brown house?
5504505 5506298 -This leads us to what?<br />-My dad's house.
5506340 5508091 Dad's house is blue.
5509384 5512429 After the divorce,<br />when Dad wasn't coming around...
5512763 5517017 I used to pretend that he was a spy<br />named Mr. Brown, who...
5517059 5520729 for the sake of his children's safety,<br />had to deny their existence.
5520771 5522189 You never told me that.
5522439 5524233 You told her that?
5524274 5526568 We've got incriminating red panties<br />in your office.
5526902 5529279 We've got a Showcase Showdown<br />worth of crap in your woodshed.
5530405 5533742 So, what in God's name<br />is at your father's house, Nick?
5533784 5534868 And be honest.
5534910 5536745 I honestly have no idea.
5543919 5547631 Whatever they found,<br />I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.
5549466 5551718 We got a lot of uncontained issues here.
5551969 5555055 Nick, do you have any idea<br />as to what Andie's mindset is?
5556265 5558058 We haven't communicated since the vigil.
5558100 5559434 Okay. Amy's parents?
5559476 5561061 -No, it's...<br />-More pressure.
5561103 5564356 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will<br />no doubt go public at any moment.
5564398 5565899 -No, Andie won't do that.<br />-She will.
5565941 5567651 They always do.<br />Don't take it personally.
5568151 5570320 Amy's got us in an interesting bind.
5570654 5572948 -We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br />-Really?
5572990 5575158 Right now,<br />Andie just gives you another motive.
5575993 5577160 We need to tell the cops<br />about the woodshed.
5577452 5578871 We need to be on the front end of that.
5578912 5581248 But I'm gonna warn you<br />as to what will happen.
5581832 5583041 They'll go after Margo.
5583083 5584084 They can't do that, can they?
5584126 5586044 She's your accomplice.<br />She helped you hide the evidence.
5586086 5588172 In all likelihood,<br />she knows that you killed Amy.
5589089 5590507 God.
5590841 5592926 Well, what are we going to do?
5592968 5593844 We find Amy.
5594261 5596597 No. Any other strategy<br />is missing the point.
5596638 5598974 I've got two ex-Secret Service guys<br />that are really good.
5599016 5600642 I'll put them on it.
5600684 5602102 But where do they start, Nick?
5602477 5603604 Where would Amy go?
5605772 5607399 I have no idea.
5611862 5614489 Are we keeping score?
5615157 5616533 Hey!
5618160 5621330 I thought we were steering clear<br />of men for a while.
5621371 5622331 He's nice.
5622372 5624875 Because he wants to fuck you.
5626502 5628045 She's still moping about her ex?
5629838 5632508 He got cheated on, too.
5635886 5638764 We three are the<br />saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.
5638805 5640349 I'm not sad.
5640891 5641850 I'm angry.
5641892 5643685 There you go.
5643727 5646355 I almost drank myself to death<br />when my wife left me.
5646396 5648649 I was gonna kill myself.<br />Can you believe that?
5648690 5649816 Don't give him the pleasure.
5649858 5652986 I was going to drown myself<br />in the Gulf of Mexico...
5653028 5655531 let myself be dinner<br />for the great whites.
5655572 5657366 Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.
5657407 5661328 Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.
5661370 5663830 Please put that on a T-shirt.
5672381 5674758 Miss Moneybags.<br />I thought you said you were broke.
5676260 5677553 That's a fat wad.
5679346 5681139 It's mostly singles.
5681181 5683058 Singles? What are you, a stripper?
5683851 5686436 Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?
5687563 5688605 We're just teasing.
5689398 5691191 Don't they tease people down in NOLA?
5693610 5696572 We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest<br />any day now.
5696613 5700325 We've got blood in the house,<br />huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.
5700367 5704329 And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,<br />missing for five days...
5704371 5706498 crying out for justice.
5707291 5709001 We'll be right back.
5761261 5763847 Tanner has a very bad idea<br />he's going to pitch you.
5763889 5764681 Yeah?
5764723 5766308 You're doing Sharon Schieber<br />tomorrow in St. Louis.
5766350 5767351 It could go so wrong.
5767392 5769144 And you are going<br />to tell her about Andie.
5769186 5770479 Nope.
5770521 5772523 That sounds like a very bad idea.
5772564 5774650 You haven't heard from her<br />in three days.
5774691 5778403 This is a ticking time bomb.<br />You've gotta throw yourself on it.
5778445 5780989 -People are gonna hate me.<br />-And then, they will forgive you.
5781031 5783492 A guy admitting that he's a<br />gigantic asshole on television?
5783534 5785202 People empathize with that.
5786620 5788539 -Why don't we just put out a statement?<br />-They need to see you.
5788580 5791667 Sharon's specials,<br />they get 10 million viewers.
5791708 5794211 She is a crusader.<br />If she takes you on as a cause--
5794253 5796171 She's going to ask real questions.
5796213 5798048 I will drill you<br />as if you were doing a deposition.
5798090 5799550 What to say, what not to say.
5799591 5800717 A trained monkey?
5800759 5802803 A trained monkey<br />who doesn't get the lethal injection.
5804137 5807599 Nick, this case<br />is about what people think of you.
5807641 5809393 They need to like you.
5809434 5813272 Now, you do this and you will reach<br />millions of those people.
5814439 5816942 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5826410 5827202 Hello?
5827244 5828453 Hey, baby.
5829913 5831498 One minute.
5840257 5841717 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
5841758 5842718 You clearing out?
5842759 5844595 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5844636 5846221 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5846263 5847306 I'll come by before--
5847347 5849099 Let us give you a hand.
5855272 5857733 Yeah, you gotta<br />clear everything out, here.
5859401 5862112 Dorothy is a real stickler.
5863447 5866742 Not even a spare hanger<br />can you leave behind.
5869328 5870787 Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.
5873415 5874416 A sock...
5875334 5878128 or undies or what have you.
5882966 5884301 You did a real good job.
5886303 5888430 Where is the money, sweetheart?
5892100 5892851 Look under her dress.
5894645 5895896 He talked you into this?
5895938 5897272 I talked him into it.
5897314 5899316 The second you leave,<br />I'm calling the cops.
5899816 5903487 Your glasses are fake.<br />Your hair's dyed all hamster.
5903529 5906615 You say your name's Nancy,<br />but you don't even answer to it half the time.
5906657 5909117 You're hiding. I don't know why,<br />and I don't really care.
5909159 5911203 But you ain't gonna call the cops.
5911537 5913539 And I don't think you've<br />ever really been hit before.
5919837 5921839 Holy shit.
5924883 5927678 Sorry, but we really need the money.
5927719 5929346 Next place, be more careful, okay?
5929388 5931557 There are a lot of people out there<br />a lot worse than we are.
5966341 5967968 Excuse me. You can't sleep here.
5995579 5998665 I did not kill my wife.
5999666 6002961 Why don't you try it again?<br />A little less wooden.
6003003 6004087 I didn't kill my wife.
6005923 6007633 -What are you doing?<br />-Every time you look smug...
6007674 6010344 or annoyed or tense,<br />I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.
6010385 6012346 -That's supposed to make me less tense?<br />-Let's try it again.
6012387 6015682 Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,<br />you and your wife had some bumps.
6016725 6020687 Yeah, we had some tough years.<br />I lost my job.
6020729 6021730 You both did.
6024441 6026318 We both lost our jobs.
6026360 6028904 I had to move back home<br />so we could take care of my mother...
6028946 6031490 who was dying of cancer<br />and my dad, who had--
6031532 6033283 Your dad's scorched earth.
6033325 6034993 Let's talk about your mom,<br />how close you were.
6035035 6036203 Go on.
6036245 6038747 For a while,<br />things had been building up.
6038789 6042292 "Built up" implies that an explosion<br />is coming. No.
6042334 6044753 At a certain point,<br />we got on the wrong track.
6045587 6047214 I had a moment of weakness.
6047256 6049675 Your "moment" was over 15 months.
6053470 6055556 I disrespected my wife.
6056223 6058642 And I disrespected my marriage.
6059101 6060477 And I'll always regret it.
6061228 6062062 That works.
6062104 6064523 Don't be afraid to play up<br />the dufus husband thing, Nick.
6064565 6066275 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.
6066316 6067150 "Everything I do is wrong."
6067192 6069236 I know.<br />What men are supposed to do in general.
6071363 6072406 -Thank you.<br />-How do you feel?
6072447 6075659 I feel good.<br />Go, can you pass me that box, please?
6076076 6078704 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present<br />to me.
6078745 6079746 You hate that watch.
6079788 6081874 No, Go. I love that watch.
6081915 6083917 Just like I love this tie.
6083959 6087087 Just like I love my wife.
6117451 6118827 It's you!
6118869 6120871 It's you.
6121705 6123707 I'm sorry.
6124374 6125709 I'm sorry.
6126627 6128629 Good God.
6128670 6130047 Last week...
6130547 6135719 I threatened to leave, and he said<br />he'd find me and he'd kill me.
6136053 6138222 So, I disappeared.
6139389 6141225 I lost the baby.
6141725 6143519 I couldn't even tell my parents.
6143560 6147481 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.
6148232 6149399 Well, he is looking for you.
6150067 6152027 He showed up on my doorstep<br />three days ago.
6152069 6154571 He tracked me from my letters to you.
6155697 6156907 You saved them.
6157491 6158534 Knowing you were out there...
6158575 6161203 was the only thing that's kept me going<br />these past few years.
6161245 6162621 Let's go to the police.<br />You can explain everything.
6162663 6163956 No, I can't turn up now.
6163997 6167084 I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.
6168919 6171213 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?
6171255 6173090 He should go to prison<br />for what he's done.
6175926 6178387 I'm setting you up at my lake house.
6178428 6179429 It's utterly secluded.
6180848 6182683 Why are you so good to me?
6182724 6184059 You know why.
6184101 6185227 Excuse me.
6185269 6186395 I know you, don't I?
6186436 6187229 No.
6187271 6189231 You're one of the Nolan girls, right?
6189273 6192150 No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.
6192192 6193068 We should leave.
6193110 6194194 Just a second.
6194778 6198031 That was Boney. I'll call her later.
6198073 6199950 Tanner. Nice to see you.
6200242 6201368 Sharon! Hi.
6201410 6203078 Hope this is worth my while.
6203120 6204246 You're gonna be very happy.
6204705 6205497 Sharon.
6205539 6207749 Ms. Schieber.<br />Thank you so much for doing this.
6207791 6209918 Can I get you anything to drink or eat<br />before we get started?
6209960 6211962 No, I had some gummy bears.
6213046 6214631 What the fuck?
6215799 6216925 I'm sorry?
6217342 6221221 We have a major shocking development<br />in the Amazing Amy disappearance.
6221263 6222639 We go live to that story now.
6222681 6223974 Oh, my God.
6226143 6227936 You little slut.
6227978 6230981 My name is Andie Fitzgerald.
6231982 6233650 I met Nicholas Dunne...
6233692 6237321 when he was my creative writing teacher<br />at Mill Valley.
6237362 6239448 Why is she dressed like a babysitter?
6239489 6240949 I am deeply ashamed...
6240991 6244119 of having been romantically involved<br />with a married man.
6244161 6246079 The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.
6246121 6248123 I truly believed we were in love.
6248165 6250000 Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite.
6251502 6252961 I know that is no excuse.
6253003 6254296 No, it is not.
6254338 6258675 I do not, in my heart, believe<br />Nick Dunne would have killed for me.
6258717 6261136 My prayers go out to everyone<br />who loves Amy.
6261178 6264181 I apologize for the pain<br />this has caused them.
6269394 6271355 We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.
6272189 6273565 That love ended today.
6273857 6275484 Come on, you're staring at ghosts.
6275526 6278195 He met our trust with lie after lie.
6278529 6280447 We now absolutely believe...
6280489 6282866 Nick is involved in the disappearance<br />of our daughter.
6282908 6285160 Our Amazing Amy.
6286036 6288163 This just got very exciting.
6288872 6290582 We need a moment.
6292584 6294336 We're gonna have to bow out of this.
6294378 6296171 -Nothing has changed.<br />-Everything has changed.
6296213 6298632 An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?
6298674 6300300 -I can handle this.<br />-We're on the defense.
6300342 6302386 This is a completely different dynamic.
6302427 6305180 -I can handle it.<br />-She's going to eat you alive.
6305722 6307391 Just trust me.
6311770 6313146 Okay.
6313188 6314273 Great.
6315107 6316567 Mic him.
6336295 6338088 One, two, three, four, five.
6344428 6345095 Thank you.
6346597 6347890 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.
6347931 6348932 Yeah, no kidding.
6353604 6356732 Roll tape. Five... four...
6356773 6358400 three... two...
6360611 6363530 Seriously, I can't believe<br />how fucking good you were.
6363572 6365032 -Amy brings out the best in me.<br />-Don't.
6365073 6368243 Keep it together, you two.<br />At least for the next 24 hours.
6368285 6370704 People still hate you.<br />Women want to scratch your eyes out.
6370746 6372623 Andie was really good TV.
6372664 6374708 -She's a good person.<br />-Therein lies the problem.
6374750 6375751 Ride this out...
6375792 6378795 and when Sharon airs tomorrow,<br />we'll be looking at a whole new you.
6378837 6380422 But, until then...
6380464 6382424 don't show your face.
6382466 6384301 No problem.
6400609 6401985 Welcome.
6403987 6405822 Make yourself at home.
6405864 6409826 I've got music, satellite...
6409868 6410827 Netflix.
6410869 6411954 He was her teacher!
6411995 6412788 Roku.
6413539 6416041 Internet, obviously.
6416625 6419336 Here is a supposedly grown man--
6419378 6423173 If there is ever anything you have<br />a taste for and you can't find it...
6423215 6425467 just let me know<br />and I will get it for you.
6425509 6428637 Instead of the A-B-C's,<br />he taught her the birds and the bees.
6428679 6431598 And just think how her mother must feel<br />at a time like this.
6431640 6433642 Wine cellar's downstairs.
6437104 6438480 I'll get you some clothes, too.
6438522 6441942 Not that I don't appreciate<br />Bait Shop Chic.
6443110 6445612 The floors are heated,<br />just dial to your liking.
6445654 6448824 There's robes and towels.<br />The shower has steam.
6448866 6451201 The bathtub has a massage cycle.
6453036 6455080 There's a great view,<br />if you're in the mood.
6455122 6456665 Blackout curtains if you're not.
6456707 6459168 The bed is Savoir.
6459209 6461461 You'll never get a better sleep.
6465340 6467676 This is just what I need.
6469136 6471054 I'm so exhausted.
6472556 6474725 I'll leave you to it, then.
6476476 6479229 Amy, I am so happy that you are here.
6480230 6483358 And I don't want you to worry<br />for one moment.
6483400 6485360 There are cameras everywhere.
6485402 6488280 The exterior, all along the grounds,<br />the entryway.
6488322 6488989 Anyone...
6489489 6491742 who is caught coming or going...
6494995 6496580 will be recorded.
6498165 6500876 You are more than safe.
6502836 6506340 And I am not letting you get away again.
6552094 6553679 -Good morning!<br />-Don't do that!
6555430 6556557 I'm sorry.
6558559 6560060 I need to feel safe.
6560394 6563397 You are very safe.
6565607 6567234 -What have you been up to?<br />-Nothing.
6567276 6569987 Amy, I'm not Nick.
6570028 6572030 It's hard for me.
6574950 6578579 After so many years<br />under someone's thumb...
6580831 6582124 I know just what that feels like.
6583041 6585043 You were never under my thumb.
6585627 6587671 -On your leash.<br />-Never.
6587713 6589214 A new start.
6590507 6592134 Decent clothes.
6593051 6595304 Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.
6595596 6597097 There's a gym overlooking the lake.
6597472 6601018 The sooner you look like yourself,<br />the sooner you'll feel like yourself.
6601059 6604188 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br />Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.
6604229 6606773 I think that's something<br />I should watch on my own.
6607191 6608901 Nonsense.
6612529 6613947 I'll be back.
6615574 6617743 And I am looking forward...
6617784 6620704 to my reunion with Amy Elliott.
6643894 6645062 Great.
6646104 6648190 Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.
6648232 6649858 -Tonight, exclusively...<br />-Hurry up.
6650776 6655155 A husband breaks his silence,<br />not just on his wife's disappearance...
6655197 6658992 but on his infidelity,<br />and all those shocking rumors.
6661453 6662996 Nick Dunne...
6663038 6666542 you're probably the most hated man<br />in America right now.
6666583 6669169 I probably am.<br />And I probably deserve it.
6669211 6670796 I bought that tie.
6670838 6672881 Did you kill your wife, Nick?
6672923 6676009 I did not kill my wife.
6676677 6678220 I am not a murderer.
6678262 6680180 But you were unfaithful.
6680222 6682432 I was unfaithful.
6682474 6684142 And I am deeply ashamed.
6684184 6686520 And, on top of that,<br />you allowed Amy's parents...
6686812 6689565 her friends,<br />all the people in your hometown...
6689606 6694528 believe you were a loving husband,<br />desperate to find his missing wife.
6694570 6696446 Well, I am desperate<br />to find my missing wife.
6696488 6699491 You say that, but I'm wondering<br />how you expect us to believe you...
6699533 6701243 now that we know you're a liar.
6701535 6704663 I didn't come forward with my affair...
6704705 6707875 because I knew it would make me look<br />really, really bad.
6708709 6710502 But I don't care about that anymore.
6710544 6712171 I just want to find my wife.
6712212 6714756 -I'm just trying to get clear--<br />-Let me be clear.
6714798 6719219 Just because I am not a murderer<br />doesn't make me a good guy.
6719261 6720429 I'm not a good guy.
6720846 6723307 I was a bad husband to a great wife.
6723682 6725434 I broke the vow that I made to her.
6725684 6728228 Those are pretty words, Nick.
6728562 6730314 But what does that really mean to you?
6730355 6732399 It basically means<br />that I was a con artist.
6733358 6736570 I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.
6736612 6738197 I was completely transfixed.
6738655 6740574 Amy can do that to you.
6740616 6743160 I was this average guy<br />from an average place...
6743202 6745204 with mediocre aspirations.
6745245 6747748 And I met a woman who dazzled me.
6747789 6749750 And I wanted her to love me...
6749791 6752127 so I pretended to be better than I was.
6753003 6756673 When we got married,<br />I promised to be that guy.
6756715 6758550 That guy who works harder.
6758592 6760802 That guy who, who lives and acts...
6760844 6763764 and loves with as much passion<br />as she does.
6764014 6765224 But I failed her.
6766141 6767267 Instead of doing what was right...
6768769 6769937 I did what was easy.
6770687 6774316 You talk like a man who believes<br />he can make amends to his wife.
6774358 6775984 Who believes his wife is still alive.
6776026 6777319 She is still alive.
6779196 6782032 Will you look at that camera for me?
6782366 6785327 Will you look in the lens...
6785369 6787329 and talk to your wife?
6787371 6790457 If she is out there,<br />able to hear and see you tonight...
6790499 6793168 what would you like to say to her, Nick?
6796713 6799007 Amy, I love you.
6799716 6802511 You're the best person I've ever known.
6802553 6807015 And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br />for the way that I've treated you.
6807057 6809017 And if you come back, I promise...
6809059 6811562 I will spend every day<br />making it up to you.
6812062 6815899 I will be the man<br />that I promised you I would be.
6818485 6819486 I love you.
6820404 6821989 Come home.
6826743 6827744 Here.
6833876 6835502 Regardless of what you thought...
6835544 6837713 What does it say?
6837754 6839298 ...I think we can all agree...
6839339 6840841 Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.
6840883 6842050 ...there's more to him<br />than meets the eye.
6842092 6843177 They're going crazy for you.
6843218 6847723 They disliked me, they liked me,<br />they hated me.
6847764 6849391 And now they love me.
6849433 6852394 ...a candor and an honesty<br />that's worthy of respect.
6852436 6854354 He's certainly earned mine.
6855189 6856273 What is it?
6859109 6862279 I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.
6867201 6869995 Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant<br />for your property.
6870037 6872247 I usually ignore tipline calls...
6872289 6876877 but a neighbor was concerned about<br />a strange man around your woodshed.
6877294 6878253 Call Tanner.
6878295 6879463 Okay. Fuck!
6883592 6885052 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.
6886303 6887137 Is that what this is about?
6888805 6893560 I have treated you more than fair<br />throughout this entire investigation.
6893602 6895896 I gave you the benefit of the doubt<br />over and over.
6895938 6897439 Every time you said something stupid...
6897481 6899858 I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."
6899900 6902444 But I was wrong.<br />That's what this is about.
6902486 6903612 Are these the clubs<br />you don't play golf with?
6903654 6904446 None of that is mine.
6904947 6906532 None of this was put here by me.
6906573 6910118 Those are nice clubs.<br />You got the makings of a real man cave.
6910160 6913288 Everything just waiting<br />until the wife goes away for good.
6913330 6914414 Nick!
6915666 6918585 -You can't do that!<br />-Of course we can.
6926885 6929471 Amy, it's time to move on.
6929513 6931223 What can I do to help?
6931932 6933475 I need some time to think.
6933517 6936019 -That's the last thing you need.<br />-Desi--
6936061 6938647 Twenty years,<br />you have kept me dangling.
6938689 6942359 Finally, last night, you came to me,<br />and you chose me.
6943068 6944403 Follow that instinct.
6944444 6946864 Don't trust the instinct<br />that left you beaten and homeless...
6947406 6950576 sleeping in your car,<br />fearing for your life.
6953912 6956623 I'm not gonna force myself on you.
6959042 6961712 I understand what you're saying, Desi.
6962963 6964590 I do.
6967926 6969928 I've been so mistreated for so long.
6972598 6975475 I've forgotten how to behave.
6981231 6983525 I'll move in here tomorrow...
6983567 6986153 and we'll work it out together.
6988238 6991950 I just want you to be you again.
6999791 7001293 They only took Margo to fuck with you.
7001335 7003045 She's not spending<br />another fucking second in there.
7003086 7005839 I'm gonna go in,<br />and I'm gonna tell them everything.
7006507 7008258 What?
7010260 7011887 We tell Boney very little.
7011929 7014056 Without a body,<br />without a murder weapon...
7014097 7016391 their only hope is a confession.
7016433 7018393 So, you let them do all the talking.
7018435 7020562 That way,<br />we can jump-start your defense.
7020604 7022981 The truth is my defense.
7028946 7029905 Recognize these?
7029947 7032074 Yes.<br />It's Amy's anniversary present to me.
7032115 7033909 Was that how she told you<br />she was pregnant, Nick?
7033951 7036453 Mommy, Daddy, baby,<br />and that made you real mad?
7036954 7038121 No.
7039373 7041124 -Recognize this?<br />-Never seen that before in my life.
7041708 7044962 It's Amy's diary.<br />We found this at your father's house.
7046964 7048257 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7048298 7050300 -He's not a handwriting ex--<br />-Looks like it.
7050342 7051468 Our experts thought so, too.
7052803 7054513 Do you wanna<br />play a little true or false?
7055264 7056473 Sure.
7056515 7060978 "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips<br />so he can taste me."
7062104 7064106 Yeah, that's true.
7065357 7067359 You thought quinoa was a fish?
7068652 7069987 That is also true, yes.
7072155 7074283 She wanted to get pregnant,<br />you assaulted her.
7074324 7076326 I hit her? No, never happened.
7076368 7077995 -"Pushed," it says "pushed."<br />-Absolutely not.
7078036 7079121 I never touched her.
7081540 7083166 She tried to buy a gun.
7083834 7085711 I doubt that, but I don't know.
7087129 7088755 Shall I read the last entry?
7088797 7089840 Sure.
7091133 7093260 "This man may kill me."
7093302 7095512 In her own words,<br />"This man may kill me."
7095554 7097681 It's kind of a convenient end note.
7104188 7105606 For future reference...
7105647 7107983 the truth,<br />you are not a handwriting expert.
7108025 7109067 Okay, I know.
7117492 7119328 Judy's missing handle.
7120871 7123165 Big as a two-by-four, right?<br />Big as a club.
7123207 7125959 We found this day one,<br />in the fireplace in your home office.
7126001 7128670 We didn't know what the hell it was,<br />but fire in July?
7128712 7129546 We bagged it.
7129588 7130714 I've never seen that before either.
7130756 7133383 We just tested it.<br />Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7133425 7135636 So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...
7135677 7137304 you're under arrest<br />for the murder of your wife.
7137346 7138555 Do not say another word.
7138597 7139932 -What about my side?<br />-Nick!
7153278 7154738 More coffee?
7154780 7156573 I'd love it.
7158867 7162496 Remember that time we skipped school<br />and drove to the Cape?
7162538 7165082 God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.
7165123 7166750 This reminds me of that.
7167251 7168919 Never-ending holiday.
7170462 7172673 You're not bored?
7172714 7174216 Desi, how could I be bored?
7174258 7176718 You can discuss<br />18th-century symphonies...
7176760 7179680 19th-century Impressionists,<br />quote Proust in French.
7180055 7184184 Nick's idea of culture<br />was a reality TV marathon...
7184226 7186103 with one hand down his boxers.
7188105 7189690 I really have to get going.
7190023 7193360 But I will be back<br />just as soon as I can.
7199950 7201034 My keys.
7206248 7208250 Thank you.
7219469 7221054 That's how the kids wear it.
7281865 7285702 Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.
7288539 7289706 Hey.
7290123 7292501 -Are you okay?<br />-Yes. Are you?
7292543 7293794 Yeah.
7293836 7295712 Let's go.
7297548 7298757 What does this mean?
7298799 7300968 Well, you're out on bond.
7301009 7304221 You can relax at home<br />while we prep for trial.
7309726 7311728 Keep your head down.
7327160 7329538 Tanner, is there<br />any fucking lead on Amy?
7329580 7331582 I've got two of my best guys on it.
7332082 7333709 She's air.
7335752 7338714 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7395938 7398482 Mr. Collings is home.
7398524 7400901 Hello, Mr. Collings.
7400943 7402819 I've missed you.
7402861 7404488 I've been thinking...
7404947 7407115 I don't wanna be without you.
7407824 7410160 Stay with me.
7410202 7413163 And when all this dies down,<br />we'll go to Greece, like you said.
7413205 7415499 Octopus and Scrabble?
7417501 7419753 How long do you think until it's done?
7419795 7423382 Not long. Six months for the trial.<br />Sentencing will be quick.
7423882 7424967 He'll appeal.
7425008 7427135 I can watch the rest overseas.
7444528 7445821 Go slowly.
7445863 7446738 But I want it.
7467217 7468802 Don't rush.
7468844 7470929 Just do it.
7479396 7480939 Harder.
7579496 7582666 You fucking bitch.
7591341 7595012 Don't you worry,<br />you're gonna have lots of babies.
7596638 7600142 Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br />There was semen present.
7600184 7601310 We'll make sure it's a match.
7601351 7603103 Yeah, it'll match.
7603145 7605606 Thank you very much.
7605647 7607149 What do you think?
7607191 7608483 Are we pals again?
7608525 7612070 Now that I know<br />you didn't murder your wife, yes.
7612112 7613071 What do you think?
7613113 7616033 Kidnapping? The story's insane.
7618202 7620662 She's on fairly heavy painkillers.
7620704 7622623 It's okay. I want to help.
7622664 7624082 Ms. Dunne, I know<br />what you've been through...
7624124 7626460 so we'll keep this very brief.
7626502 7628879 Can you walk us through what happened?
7631507 7634134 That morning, the doorbell rang.
7635010 7637012 So normal.
7637054 7638889 I opened the door.
7639515 7641350 So strange.
7641975 7645604 Since high school,<br />he won't ever go away.
7645646 7648732 And I've just tried to be nice to him.
7648774 7650400 Answer his letters.
7650651 7652653 Keep him calm.
7654071 7655531 Oh, my God.
7656156 7657783 I've encouraged him.
7657824 7659618 You can't blame yourself.
7661245 7663413 He pushed inside.
7664998 7667042 And he grabbed me.
7667751 7670838 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.
7671171 7672881 And he clubbed me.
7673340 7674758 I collapsed.
7674800 7678846 That club was actually the handle<br />to a Punch and Judy puppet.
7678887 7680305 Right.
7681223 7682641 Treasure hunt.
7684560 7686603 I'd hidden some puppets at Go's--
7686645 7688355 Then how did Desi have that handle?
7690232 7692150 I'd just found it.
7692901 7695320 It must have fallen off.
7697239 7700909 I was holding it when Desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7700951 7702160 About that woodshed...
7702202 7703871 He took me to his lake house.
7704454 7706164 Tied me to his bed.
7706206 7708750 Back to the woodshed real quick.<br />Real quick.
7708792 7710627 When you went<br />to place the puppets there...
7710669 7712045 did you notice that it was packed--
7712087 7713255 Lots of stuff.
7713297 7717718 Corresponding to purchases made<br />on credit cards in your husband's name.
7717759 7719261 Nick and credit cards.
7719303 7721847 He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.
7721889 7724683 He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.<br />They're very close.
7725225 7729563 Now, may I go back<br />to where I was being held prisoner...
7729605 7732357 by a man with a history<br />of mental problems?
7732399 7733275 Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
7737779 7739865 Desi assaulted me that night.
7740824 7742659 Every night.
7743785 7746205 He tied me up like a dog.
7747581 7750083 And then, he'd punish me.
7752002 7754046 Starve me.
7755339 7757257 Shave me.
7758884 7760844 Sodomize me.
7761637 7763472 There were cameras everywhere.
7763514 7766475 Please find this. Please find the tapes.
7768143 7771355 She slit his throat with a box cutter.
7772439 7774650 How did she manage<br />to get a hold of a box cutter...
7774691 7777277 if he had her tied up the whole time?
7778237 7780280 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7781073 7783033 Amy, we found your diary.
7783075 7787162 It contains many concerning allegations<br />of mental and physical abuse.
7787204 7790082 Well, it's the ugly truth.
7790916 7792417 Nick didn't want a baby.
7794253 7797548 He has a temper. We had money problems.
7798465 7799591 But I love him.
7799633 7801385 Then why did you try to buy a gun?
7803345 7805430 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7805472 7807307 If I could just clarify one thing--
7807349 7810561 If this case had been left<br />in your deeply incompetent hands...
7810602 7812479 my husband would be on death row...
7812771 7816525 and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...
7816817 7820487 Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.<br />We're finished.
7821363 7823532 Now, I have to ask you...
7823574 7826410 do you feel safe<br />going home with your husband?
7838839 7841466 We prayed to God,<br />and God has answered our prayers.
7841508 7842885 Amy Dunne is home.
7842926 7845012 Now, I know there are<br />a lot of questions and concerns...
7845053 7847055 but for right now, we wanna sit tight...
7847097 7852019 and just be thankful and grateful<br />for this miracle on the Mississippi.
7859484 7861278 Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.
7913038 7914248 We love you, Amy!
7918877 7920712 All right, you can stop pretending now.
7920754 7922422 I'm not pretending.
7923131 7924842 You were perfect.
7925467 7928011 The Nick I saw on TV,<br />that's the Nick I fell in love with.
7928053 7930764 You do know I was just telling you<br />what you wanted to hear, right?
7930806 7932641 That's how well you know me.
7932683 7935310 You know me in your marrow.
7936311 7937896 Okay.
7937938 7941275 You need to tell me<br />exactly what happened.
7942568 7943819 Take off your clothes.
7944319 7947531 I need to make sure<br />you're not wearing a wire.
7960836 7964840 You killed someone, Amy.<br />You're a murderer.
7964882 7966466 I'm a fighter.
7966508 7968969 I fought my way back to you.
7969011 7970846 You killed a guy.
7970888 7972848 You slashed his throat<br />with a box cutter.
7972890 7977561 You went on national television<br />and begged for me to save your life.
7978145 7979396 And I obliged.
7979438 7980898 But I want that Nick.
7981231 7982649 I'm leaving.
7982691 7985319 You really think that's smart?
7985986 7986945 Shampoo.
7989698 7993619 Wounded, raped wife battles her way<br />back to her husband...
7993660 7995537 and he deserts her.
7995579 7996622 They'll destroy you.
7997372 7998874 Neighbors will shun you.
7998916 8003128 And I'll make sure that no one forgets<br />the pain you caused me.
8005214 8010302 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8010886 8012513 Once they go...
8013388 8014306 I go.
8014348 8017768 Give it the night. Sleep on it.
8034618 8036203 Was there ever a baby?
8036495 8038580 There can be.
8042584 8043585 Good night.
8096513 8098182 Hey, Nick!
8110319 8111570 Hello, handsome.
8114698 8116450 Crepe?
8117159 8118076 Sure.
8118118 8119828 She was his dream girl.
8119870 8123290 And when this spoiled, rich,<br />entitled little boy couldn't have her...
8123332 8124708 he took her.
8132090 8133425 You must be so proud.
8140682 8142684 It's been four hours.
8143185 8146021 Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?
8150192 8153028 Right now, it's all about our marriage.
8153862 8157366 When two people love each other<br />and can't make that work...
8157407 8159826 that's the real tragedy.
8163580 8165624 Kiss my cheek.
8171964 8174758 I can't believe that fucking spider<br />is America's sweetheart.
8174800 8177010 She told me she killed Desi.
8177052 8178387 Not self-defense. Murder.
8178428 8179972 -Can't we get a wire?<br />-That's not gonna work.
8180013 8181181 She told you once before.
8181223 8183559 Yeah, because she had me strip naked,<br />and stand in the shower.
8183600 8186854 I swear, you two are the most<br />fucked-up people I've ever known.
8186895 8188355 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8188605 8190440 You and Amy under the same roof?
8190482 8192276 You should pitch that<br />as reality television.
8192901 8195279 Amy Dunne,<br />and the Miracle on the Mississippi.
8195320 8197823 Nick and I have been through<br />some bad patches.
8197865 8199199 We've had our dark days.
8199241 8201075 But we thank you so much...
8201576 8206123 for supporting us in our new life together,<br />for forgiving Nick.
8206373 8210084 Really, your encouragement<br />means the world.
8210127 8211545 She's good.
8211587 8214173 Amazing Amy and the Humbled Husband.
8214214 8216299 The Real Housewives of Branson.
8216341 8217425 Take care of this guy, will you?
8217467 8218843 I can't believe you're just leaving now.
8219093 8220637 You are not at risk anymore.
8220679 8222222 I'm the definition of "at risk."
8222263 8226393 You got a book deal, a Lifetime movie,<br />you franchised The Bar.
8226434 8227477 You may wanna thank her.
8230522 8231940 Just don't piss her off.
8232773 8233525 See you, guys.
8235903 8237571 Elvis has left Missouri.
8237612 8238697 She had to have made a mistake.
8238739 8241032 We need to check Amy's story,<br />piece by piece.
8241074 8242950 Nick, I can't do anything.
8243368 8246205 We had the national spotlight on us,<br />we stained the rug.
8246245 8247956 The case is with the Feds now,<br />they're done.
8247998 8249040 That doesn't mean you have to be done.
8249458 8251251 It does.
8282824 8284284 What are you doing?
8286202 8287788 Couldn't sleep.
8287829 8288496 Come on...
8289121 8291290 let me tuck you back in.
8303971 8306598 You know you can sleep with me, right?
8308683 8310769 Yeah, it's just...
8310811 8312312 I need more time.
8312353 8315898 I would never, ever hurt you.
8317692 8320153 I do need you to participate, though.
8320195 8322364 I need you to do your part.
8332665 8333416 Okay.
8334418 8337254 Everything you have heard<br />about my wife...
8337296 8338672 is a lie.
8338714 8342800 She is a calculating,<br />murderous psychopath.
8343427 8344969 And I have been complicit--
8345012 8346138 Nick!
8351809 8353978 Nick? Breakfast.
8354021 8354855 Honey?
8358566 8361028 We should hold hands.
8361068 8364156 Not the entire time,<br />but on and off throughout.
8365574 8367784 "So, Nick, how does it feel<br />to have your wife back?"
8370412 8372289 "It's fantastic.
8372331 8375375 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8375416 8377127 "Fantastic" is a little flippant.
8377544 8378670 "Amazing"?
8378712 8381548 I need you<br />to admit that you got the credit cards...
8381590 8384593 and that you hid all that stuff at Go's<br />and that you pushed me.
8385343 8388388 I'm gonna need<br />those three things to feel safe.
8389598 8391433 You have to own this, Nick.
8392226 8395771 Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.
8397356 8399107 Nick.
8402069 8404696 What a beautiful home.
8405948 8408617 I so appreciate<br />you giving us this time, Nick.
8408659 8410827 You went on national television...
8410869 8413330 and told people that I murdered my wife.
8413372 8414623 I go where the story goes.
8414665 8417626 You implied that I had carnal relations<br />with my sister.
8417668 8421213 I didn't use the "I" word.<br />I said you two were "extremely close."
8421255 8425926 You and a panel of nitwits<br />diagnosed me as a sociopath.
8427135 8428887 Ice-breaker.
8432599 8434393 To go with your robot dog.
8434434 8436478 I'll go find Amy.
8438522 8440607 She's downstairs.
8443110 8444736 -What is it?<br />-It's for you.
8444778 8446196 Open it.
8446488 8448240 I don't need any more gifts from you.
8448282 8449992 Open it.
8462546 8464214 I didn't touch you.
8464256 8465299 You didn't need to.
8465340 8468552 Bullshit. That notice of disposal.
8468594 8470095 I have that. You threw it out.
8470137 8471972 The notice, yes.
8472347 8473223 I want a blood test.
8473765 8474850 I want a paternity test.
8475642 8476977 I love tests.
8477019 8478854 You can teach those people<br />to hate me all you want.
8478896 8481607 I don't care. I am leaving you.
8483734 8486445 I won't have to teach your child<br />to hate you.
8486486 8488864 He'll do that all by himself.
8488906 8490782 You fucking cunt!
8492659 8495037 I'm the cunt you married.
8495078 8496872 The only time you liked yourself...
8496914 8500584 was when you were trying to be someone<br />this cunt might like.
8500626 8504087 I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.
8507841 8511094 I've killed for you.<br />Who else can say that?
8512346 8514890 You think you would be happy<br />with a nice Midwestern girl?
8514932 8517768 No way, baby. I'm it.
8517809 8521230 Look, you're delusional. You're insane.
8521271 8522773 Why would you even want this?
8523148 8524233 Yes, I loved you.
8524274 8527736 And then all we did was resent each other,<br />and try to control each other.
8527778 8528779 And cause each other pain.
8529321 8531114 That's marriage.
8533784 8536161 Now, I'm getting ready.
8561478 8564565 I can't watch you play house<br />with that thing for the next 18 years.
8564606 8566275 I can't just walk away.
8566316 8567901 You could get custody.
8567943 8571822 No, I won't. And you know it.
8571864 8574366 It's gonna be my child.<br />I'm not gonna leave it.
8574992 8576785 You wanna stay.
8576827 8580747 I have a responsibility.<br />It's not about what I want anymore.
8580789 8582040 You wanna stay with her.
8592676 8593719 You're breaking my heart.
8594178 8597806 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8597848 8600350 I need you with me on this.
8600392 8602853 Of course I'm with you.
8605480 8609484 I was with you before we were even born.
8611236 8614031 We've been through the darkness.
8614573 8617868 We've come out, united.
8620871 8623040 We communicate.
8625334 8627836 We're honest with each other.
8627878 8629379 Right?
8631298 8633800 We're partners in crime.
8637179 8638013 And?
8639890 8641225 And?
8644728 8646647 We're gonna be parents.
8648357 8649983 My goodness!
8650400 8652361 -How exciting!<br />-Thank you.
8657157 8659535 "What are you thinking?"
8662371 8664581 "How are you feeling?"
8666542 8669169 "What have we done to each other?"
8670754 8672840 "What will we do?"
