22773 23773 <i>When I think of my wife...</i>
26193 28703 <i>...I always think of her head.</i>
30155 33065 <i>I picture cracking her lovely skull...</i>
33116 35366 <i>Unspooling her brains...</i>
35410 38040 <i>Trying to get answers.</i>
39248 42748 <i>The primal questions of any marriage.</i>
42793 45133 <i>"What are you thinking?"</i>
45170 47420 <i>"How are you feeling?"</i>
47464 50094 <i>"What have we done to each other?"</i>
145062 149572 Well, the Irish Prince<br />graces us with his presence.
150734 153864 His majesty prefers not to be moistened.
155072 156362 I got you a present.
157150 159410 - Oh... I hated this game.<br />- You loved it.
159451 160741 You loved it.
160786 163076 Thank you. I'll add it to the collection.
163872 166042 Can you pour me a bourbon?
172297 174377 What's up, jitters?
178095 180435 Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm<br />gonna have to fill the silence...
180472 183852 with another excruciating story by Margo Dunne.
183892 186562 Let's see, I could tell you about my<br />recent customer service experience...
186603 188613 - changing Internet Service Providers.<br />- I like that one.
188647 191517 Or how about the time I saw that woman who<br />looked exactly like my friend, Monica?
191567 193487 But it wasn't Monica. It was a total stranger.
193527 195447 Who was also named Monica.
195904 197414 - Made it kind of interesting.<br />- It's great.
198240 199570 I'm just having a bad day.
199616 201576 - Amy?<br />- It's our anniversary.
201618 203578 - Five years.<br />- Five?
203620 204790 That came fast.
204830 206160 And furious.
210711 213801 <i>I'm so crazy, stupid happy.</i>
216633 218093 <i>I met a boy.</i>
218135 222565 <i>A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.</i>
224808 226098 Excuse me, miss?
226143 227603 I just want you to be careful...
227644 230444 Where you put down that<br />monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
230480 233190 because the party's down to three<br />beast lights and a bottle of pucker.
233233 234943 It might attract some desperate characters.
234985 237825 It could. I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa.
241909 244449 They already relieved me of<br />my artisanal meat platter.
244494 247374 Finally, someone tells me<br />how to pronounce that word.
247414 248374 "Meat"?
248415 249665 Yes, "meat." One syllable.
250000 252670 Thank you. Whose beer am I about to drink?
252711 254001 Don't tell me.
254671 256341 Let's see, who's your type?
256757 257837 I don't see you sitting quietly...
257883 261473 while he bloviates on his<br />postgrad thesis about Proust.
261512 263812 Uh-oh. Is that him?
263847 266057 Ironic hipster, so self-aware,<br />he makes everything a joke.
266350 269350 I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."
271188 272518 What type are you?
272564 274024 Corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.
274066 275186 Missouri?
275234 276154 Cute.
276193 278533 - Native New Yorker?<br />- The world ends at the Hudson.
278570 279650 What's your name?
279696 280656 Amy.
280697 283027 Well, Amy, who are you?
284368 287538 A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.
287579 291749 B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.
291792 294922 C, I write personality quizzes for magazines.
295295 299505 Okay. Your hands are far too<br />delicate for real scrimshaw work...
299550 302800 and I happen to be a charter subscriber<br />to middling warlord weekly...
302845 304055 so I'd recognize you.
304388 305718 I'm gonna go with "C."
305764 307184 And you?
308016 309556 Who are you?
309601 313941 I'm the guy to save you...<br />from all this awesomeness.
318026 320856 So, you write for a men's magazine.
320904 324164 God, does that make you an expert on being a man?
324199 325279 No.
325976 327366 It's, you know, what to wear, what to drink.
327411 329371 How to bullshit.
329413 331003 Never with you.
331039 331869 Ha, ha.
331915 333535 No, I mean it.
333584 335384 It's hard to believe you.
335419 336209 Why?
336253 337883 I think it's your chin.
337921 339051 My chin?
339089 341759 Yeah, it's quite villainous.
341800 343430 Okay, how's this?
344428 347598 A hundred percent true, no bullshit.
347973 348933 Okay.
348974 350564 We all move to New York...
350601 354731 and we end up living in these little<br />cubby holes, and that's not it.
354771 358231 Come outside. Then, you're in it.
360652 362402 You have to see this.
370954 372044 Hey.
372080 373040 Hey.
382049 383799 I have to kiss you now.
383842 385262 Is that right?
385302 388472 I can't let you go through<br />a sugar storm unkissed.
390307 391467 Wait a second.
394186 395646 There you go.
407574 408994 Nick Dunne...
410744 412834 I really like you.
419002 421252 So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary...
422214 423514 treasure hunts?
423549 425549 You mean the forced march, designed to prove...
425592 428552 what an oblivious and uncaring<br />asshole her husband is?
428595 429675 Wow.
432516 434226 Life. I don't remember the point.
434268 436478 Deep Hasbro thoughts.
436520 437850 Spin.
438689 440899 What was the clue last year she got so mad about?
440941 444241 "When your poor Amy has a cold...
444278 445988 "This dessert just must be sold."
446029 446989 The answer?
447030 448820 I still don't know the answer, Go.
448866 451026 - A few years ago, you'd have known.<br />- A few years ago, it was fun.
451076 452736 Year one, the traditional gift was paper.
452786 456246 She got me a beautiful notebook.<br />Told me to go write my novel.
456290 457170 What did you get her?
457207 458577 A kite.
458625 460455 - She'd never flown a kite.<br />- Okay.
461420 464010 Anyway. Year four, flowers.
464047 467297 She led me outside to the dying<br />rosebush in the backyard.
467634 468684 That's symbolic.
468719 469679 Yeah.
469720 471180 What's the gift for five?
471221 472011 Wood.
472055 474515 - So, what did you get her?<br />- There's no good gift for wood.
474558 477888 I know! Go home, fuck her brains<br />out, slap her with your penis.
477936 479396 "There's some wood for you, bitch."
482941 484231 The Bar.
484985 487405 Why, yes. Hang on one second.
487446 488606 Hey, it's watchful Wally.
490908 492908 Hey, Walt. What's going on?
495287 498367 Thanks very much. I'll be right there.<br />All right, bye-bye.
510594 513264 Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?
514473 515973 Thanks, Walt!
531657 533027 Ame?
553387 554847 Amy!
567526 568186 Hello?
568694 570154 Come on in.
570904 571704 Hey.
571738 573158 - Mr. Dunne.<br />- Hi.
573198 575698 I'm detective Rhonda Boney.<br />This is officer James Gilpin.
575742 577702 We understand there are concerns about your wife.
577744 581664 I don't know where my wife is.<br />And I came home to this.
582708 585498 Now, I don't panic easily...
585836 587916 but it's weird, right?
589173 590173 Mind if we look around?
590424 591344 Please.
591383 592633 How long have you two been here?
592676 595506 Two years in September. We<br />used to live in New York.
595554 596644 City?
596680 599810 Yeah, I was a writer. We were both writers.
599850 601480 Why'd y'all move back here?
601518 603138 My mom got sick.
603187 606147 Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?
606190 607650 She's dead.
607691 608691 I'm so sorry.
614406 616696 What do you do now, for work?
617576 619406 My sister Margo and I own The Bar, downtown.
619870 621710 Oh, The Bar.
621747 623997 Love the name. Very meta.
624041 625131 Thanks.
628086 629876 Pretty things.
634635 635975 Stay.
636011 637761 My office, here.
640807 642847 Beautiful dress.
646855 647645 Date night?
647689 648939 It's our anniversary.
652110 653610 It's a guest bedroom, there.
653904 655534 Cat's room on the end.
655572 657122 I checked up here.
661495 662585 This is the kitchen...
662621 663961 obviously.
679721 681561 This is my wife's office.
681598 683218 Amy's office.
696280 699320 Wow. Impressive gal.
699366 700576 Yeah. Should I be concerned?
700617 701787 I remember these.
703036 704286 I loved these books.
708458 709878 Wait a minute.
709918 711918 Your wife is Amazing Amy?
712504 714844 Yeah. She is.
714882 716512 Wow.
719511 723141 <i>Amazing-fucking-Amy is getting fucking married.</i>
723182 724972 <i>That's how the night started.</i>
725017 731107 <i>With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br />jealous, as always, of the golden child.</i>
731148 735738 <i>Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,<br />who's getting fucking married.</i>
736069 737859 When I was 10, I quit cello.
737905 741495 In the next book, Amazing Amy became a prodigy.
743952 744742 Did you play volleyball?
744995 746875 I got cut, Freshman year.
746914 748834 She made varsity.
750250 752250 When did you have a dog?
752294 753294 She got the dog.
753921 756421 Puddles made her more relatable.
756465 757805 Wow.
757841 759971 I love your parents...
760010 761800 but they really can be assholes.
761845 763295 - Nick!<br />- Sir!
763347 765137 Hey, thanks for coming, man.
765182 765972 No problem.
766016 767426 Hey, sweetheart.
768018 769438 Big night for your mom.
769478 773308 It would mean so much if you<br />would talk to a few reporters...
773357 775227 bloggers, give them a little Amy color.
775275 777145 People wanna hear from you.
777194 778824 - We can't stay long.<br />- Fantastic.
778862 781032 Fifteen minutes, tops.
781365 785665 This is why I have my brownstone. My trust fund.<br />I know I can't complain.
785702 788332 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
788372 792422 No, they improved upon it, and<br />then peddled it to the masses.
792459 794669 I thought you were gonna wear<br />white to match the wedding theme.
794711 796171 I thought that would be creepy.
796213 798473 "If it's worth doing, it's worth doing..."
798615 801045 Hold up! I know how this ends.<br />Don't-don't tell me.
801093 802893 You're very cute, Nick.
802928 804548 Amy, you know what would make dad's night.
804596 806216 I'm on it.
807516 810516 I love having strangers pick at my scabs.
810561 811811 I'm curious whether...
811854 814164 it's difficult for you to see<br />Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
814189 817029 And this big party celebrating<br />this fictional wedding.
817067 819397 Because it's my understanding<br />you are not married.
819444 821114 Is that correct?
822072 825832 Correct. Amazing Amy has always<br />been one step ahead of me.
825868 829698 Excuse me. I'm sorry, I<br />just, have a few questions.
830080 831000 It's you.
831039 833579 I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity.
833876 837206 Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br />of dating Nick Dunne for how long?
837254 840054 - Two magical years.<br />- Two magical years.
840090 841930 In the course of that time,<br />you've had the opportunity...
841967 844427 to perform such gracious gestures as...
844469 848389 not correcting Nick when he<br />pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
848432 849892 An understandable mistake.
849933 851103 He also thought it was a fish.
851143 852733 He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.
853770 856060 You also manage to appear<br />shocked and delighted...
856106 858686 when Nick's elderly mother breaks<br />into an impromptu rendition...
858734 860944 of New York, New York, every time she sees you.
860986 863026 These bag of bone shoes...
863071 864241 That's just frightening.
864281 866911 You also bought Nick his<br />very first pair of scissors.
866950 868620 And matching stapler.
868660 871580 Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.
871622 875132 You are brilliant, yet entirely un-snobby.
875167 878797 You challenge me. You surprise me.
878837 880167 And, fun fact for the readers...
880589 882299 you have a world-class vagina.
884493 887433 Now, my colleagues tell me that<br />you are not yet married.
887971 889761 Is that correct?
889806 891266 I'm not.
891308 892638 Isn't it time we fixed that?
894102 895772 <i>And then...</i>
895812 898652 <i>the night wasn't so bad anymore.</i>
914998 917498 And it's done. Crossed off the list.
917543 921503 Now, normally, we would not treat this<br />as a missing persons case so quick...
921547 922957 But given the scene at your house...
923006 925126 and given our spike in violent crime, of late...
925175 927635 we are gonna take this very, very seriously.
927678 928638 Okay. Good.
928679 931969 So, we've got Forensics over at your place.<br />You got somewhere to stay?
932015 933595 - Uh, yeah, I could stay at my sister's.<br />- Okay.
933642 935942 We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards.
935978 937648 We will organize searches, put up flyers.
937688 940388 - We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.<br />- You're having a press conference?
940432 942022 Yeah, I wanna get the word out, right?
942359 946649 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel<br />like I'm on a Law & Order episode.
953505 956875 Now, uh, time is of the essence, in these cases.
956915 959665 But, that said, do you wanna<br />wait and call a lawyer?
959710 960840 Absolutely not. I just wanna help.
960878 962668 Okay, so, you and Amy have been here two years.
962713 965973 - You tend bar...<br />- I own The Bar.
966008 969508 And I teach creative writing at MVCC.
969553 971353 - No kids?<br />- Not yet.
971388 972848 So, what does Amy do most days?
972890 975100 A woman with all those degrees, what does she do?
975601 977021 I don't know. She keeps busy.
977060 978560 Doing what?
980772 982402 She's a voracious reader.
982441 985281 So, she's always got a book in her hand.
986361 987821 Well, days can get long.
987863 991703 I mean, I know a few housewives, that evening<br />glass of wine starts coming at noon.
991742 993032 Or, prescription pills.
993076 994576 Just last week, we had a soccer mom.
994620 997080 Nice lady. Got her teeth<br />kicked in over some oxycontin.
997122 999212 Ever since that mall went bust,<br />half the town is out of work.
999249 1000749 We cannot keep up with the drug violence.
1000792 1003212 I'm pretty sure that's not it.
1003253 1005093 Has Amy got friends we can talk to?
1007090 1008380 No, not really.
1008425 1010385 No friends? This whole town?
1010427 1014057 She was very close with my<br />mom, before she passed away.
1014097 1015927 You know, we have a pretty<br />serious homeless problem...
1016266 1017386 in our neighborhood.
1017726 1019306 I think maybe you guys should check that out.
1020471 1021471 We'll look into that.
1021513 1024443 So, you got to The Bar around 11:00 today.
1024483 1026073 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that off.
1026109 1027069 Well, I was home.
1027110 1029740 I left at 9:30, I got a cup<br />of coffee, a newspaper.
1029780 1031410 I went to Sawyer Beach and read the news.
1031448 1033618 Did you visit with anyone there?
1033659 1035619 I kind of go to Sawyer Beach for the solitude.
1036787 1039367 So, your wife has no friends here.
1039414 1041254 Is she kinda standoffish?
1041291 1043711 Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?
1043752 1045252 She's from New York.
1046421 1049761 She's complicated. She's...<br />got very high standards.
1049800 1050630 Type A?
1050968 1053548 That can make you crazy if you're not like that.
1053595 1056425 You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.
1056473 1058643 Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?
1059184 1060984 God, I don't know. I'd have<br />to look it up at the house.
1061019 1063809 You don't know if she has friends, you<br />don't know what she does all day...
1063856 1065766 and you don't know your wife's blood type.
1065816 1066936 Sure you all are married?
1068694 1069654 Maybe it's type O.
1069695 1071815 - Where are her folks? New York?<br />- Yeah.
1071847 1073657 Can they get here in time for<br />this press conference tomorrow?
1073699 1075739 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1075784 1077624 You haven't called your wife's parents yet?
1077661 1080081 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1080122 1082582 Well, call them, please, Nick. Now.
1082624 1083834 Fine.
1089339 1091299 Should I know my wife's blood type?
1091341 1092341 No.
1092676 1096466 I apologize, Marybeth.<br />I didn't know what was going on.
1096513 1098013 Now I'm at the station...
1098056 1101556 and the cops are at the house, and<br />it's serious and I'm calling you.
1102269 1105229 There's a lot of things that<br />are being juggled right now.
1105272 1108532 I'm standing right next to<br />detective Rhonda Boney...
1108567 1110527 who's the lead investigator on this and she's...
1112779 1114949 My mother-in-law would like to speak with you.
1116366 1117656 This is detective Boney.
1117701 1119041 I wanna go home.
1119077 1121537 I don't know why I have to be here.
1121580 1124210 I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.
1124249 1125379 Dad?
1125792 1127382 What? This is my father. What's going on?
1127419 1128459 Really? You're Nick Dunne?
1128712 1130712 We've been trying to get a<br />hold of you all afternoon.
1130756 1132416 I've been right there. My wife is missing.
1132466 1133586 - Bitch.<br />- Don't.
1133634 1136014 Your father wandered out of<br />Comfort Hill after lunch.
1136053 1138333 We found him walking Route 79, disoriented.
1138372 1140232 - We've been trying to call you for the last...<br />- I don't get
1140273 1141223 a cell signal in this building.
1141266 1143426 I've been sitting 20 feet away from<br />you, with two other police officers.
1143560 1145190 Sir, please don't take that tone with me.
1145229 1146349 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.
1146396 1147936 Dad, stop.
1150609 1151819 You wanna drive him home?
1152486 1154776 I think that would be wise. Thanks.
1174341 1177431 <i>This voice mailbox is currently full.</i>
1178345 1179255 Fuck.
1181473 1184063 Get your fucking hands off me.

1236820 1237900 My God.
1238097 1239887 You-you naughty minx.
1240032 1243122 Well, technically, we are supposed<br />to fuck at the next stop.
1243160 1244790 Yeah, in keeping with tradition.
1244828 1248328 But I might be willing to<br />bend the rules this once.
1248373 1250083 God bless Jane Austen.
1265432 1269442 I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br />It's confirmed by the...
1272397 1274687 Thank you.
1275734 1277194 Year two. Cotton.
1283951 1288201 We had that joke that our sex<br />was too good for ordinary.
1288247 1290707 So, these are 2,000 thread-count...
1295754 1298674 We're so cute. I wanna punch us in the face.
1298715 1301925 That's pretty great. I mean,<br />that is pretty great.
1303387 1304847 Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?
1304888 1307058 I don't need a lawyer. Here, I'll do this.
1307558 1309518 Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy?
1309560 1310730 You know, they asked, like...
1311061 1312521 why didn't she have any friends?
1312563 1313403 What did you say?
1313438 1315438 - I said she was complicated.<br />- Nick!
1316441 1319071 Everyone knows "complicated" is code for "bitch."
1324491 1326281 God. I feel sick.
1326326 1327736 Thanks.
1328745 1330035 It's so bizarre.
1330080 1332580 It seems like the kind of thing<br />that would happen to Amy.
1332624 1333794 She always attracts...
1333834 1335424 Drama?
1336253 1337633 You can say it. It's just me and you.
1337671 1340221 Just because I don't like to be around Amy...
1340257 1341507 doesn't mean I don't care about her.
1344595 1346765 Anyway, whoever took her is<br />bound to bring her back.
1356106 1358146 Detective? Excuse me.
1358192 1360822 I'm Noelle Hawthorne.<br />I'm Amy's best friend.
1361945 1364605 Well, great. Where do you live, Noelle?
1365157 1366657 Five doors down. 1032.
1366700 1368910 Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.
1368952 1370832 Can I come by in half an hour?
1370871 1372581 - Y'all know anything yet?<br />- I'm sorry.
1372623 1375423 I got guys on the clock in here.<br />But you give me 30 minutes.
1375459 1376789 But that's usually bath time.
1377544 1380134 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.
1382883 1384183 All right. So, what do you got?
1384218 1386848 It was definitely blood spatter<br />you saw in the kitchen.
1387346 1389006 Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.
1389056 1391426 Not that weird, but that is awfully high.
1391475 1393105 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.
1393143 1394313 Well, okay.
1397022 1398112 Interesting.
1398148 1399268 What's that?
1399316 1402816 House is rented in her name. Car's in her name.
1402861 1405991 Credit cards, utilities,<br />phone bill, all in her name.
1406031 1407871 Even his bar's in her name.
1407908 1409828 I don't know that that's so surprising.
1409868 1411488 No. But it is humiliating.
1411537 1412447 What you got?
1412496 1415326 It's with her, uh, unmentionables.
1427678 1430558 Well, we have our first clue.
1441650 1443320 I have to take a shower.
1443360 1445150 No, don't. You've been up all night.
1445195 1447355 You wanna look like you've been up all night.
1448991 1451331 Hey, be careful today, okay?
1451368 1452698 That's a weird thing to say.
1452744 1456504 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.<br />You can seem angry, like...
1456540 1458040 Please don't say, "Like dad."
1458083 1460843 or else you swing into your momma's-boy<br />charm offensive and that can feel glib.
1460878 1461668 Perfect.
1461712 1464462 I'll balance on the exact fucking<br />edge of your emotional razor.
1464506 1466336 Okay. Just be...
1466383 1468303 Myself?
1468343 1470683 <i>...sponsoring a raffle to<br />benefit West County 4H...</i>

1485444 1486494 - Hi, Rand.<br />- Hey, man.
1486528 1487358 I'm detective Boney.
1487404 1489364 I'm the twin. Margo.
1489406 1492486 We played tennis yesterday, Nick.<br />I just can't get over it.
1492534 1493874 Marybeth, I am really sorry.
1493911 1495701 I knew you never should have moved back here.
1495746 1496866 We didn't have a lot of choice.
1496914 1500584 We are all worried. We are all scared.
1500626 1505086 But we are all here now. And<br />we will find Amy, together.
1515307 1517227 Should I just go first, and then<br />you guys can say something?
1517267 1518227 Good.
1519895 1524235 As you know, my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...
1524274 1527074 disappeared from our home on<br />the morning of July 5th...
1528028 1530568 under suspicious circumstances.
1530614 1532074 Louder!
1532115 1536535 If anyone out there has any information...
1536578 1538908 please come forward.
1538956 1540576 Thank you.
1542918 1545748 I'm Rand Elliott. My wife, Marybeth Elliott.
1545796 1546876 Should I have said my name?
1547464 1549424 Amy is our only child.
1549466 1553466 She's bright, she's beautiful. She's kind.
1553971 1555471 She really is Amazing Amy.
1555806 1558516 You know, there are millions<br />of people out there...
1558559 1561099 who grew up with her and care about her.
1561144 1563774 We care about her, we love her.
1564481 1567071 And... we just want her back.
1568986 1571606 Amy is a decorated scholar.
1571655 1574625 She forged a successful career in journalism.
1574658 1576948 She returned here to her husband's hometown...
1576994 1579334 and she made a life in her adopted home.
1580414 1582794 Now, Amy needs your help.
1582833 1586963 We're establishing a volunteer<br />headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
1587004 1592344 We have a hotline, 1-855-4-Amy-tips.
1592593 1598013 And our website is www.findamazingamy.com.
1598515 1600475 - Mr. Dunne!<br />- Mr. Elliott!
1601852 1603692 Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?
1605439 1609109 Mr. Elliott, when was the last<br />time you spoke to your daughter?
1610611 1611611 Smile.
1618202 1619792 That's all for now. Thank you.
1622372 1625212 Amy is the kind of girl who attracts admirers.
1625250 1626130 Right, Nick?
1626168 1627338 Yeah, definitely.
1627377 1629877 And we've had instances...
1629922 1631972 - where things got...<br />- Scary.
1632007 1633467 Do you know about Desi Collings?
1633509 1635179 Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings.
1635219 1636469 He was obsessed.
1636512 1639852 He attempted suicide after Amy<br />broke up with him Sophomore year.
1639890 1641430 We had to file a restraining order.
1641475 1643855 This would be high school? Twenty years ago?
1643894 1646814 But he recently moved to St. Louis.<br />That's just two hours away.
1646847 1649017 But, to be fair, he is from St. Louis.
1649066 1650686 We also have Tommy O'Hara.
1650734 1652944 This is only eight years ago, in New York.
1652986 1655276 She broke up with him, he got very physical.
1655322 1656992 - She filed charges.<br />- What was the charge?
1657032 1659122 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?
1659159 1661119 I only know it was bad.
1661161 1662951 - I didn't know this.<br />- Okay.
1662996 1664506 Thank you.
1664557 1666347 Uhh, anything more recent?
1669586 1671586 Not that I know of.
1674049 1676969 Hey, Nick? You got a minute?
1678136 1679756 Yeah.
1685143 1686523 Imagine our confusion.
1686562 1687732 A missing persons case...
1687771 1690361 and in your wife's dressing room,<br />we find an envelope marked, "clue."
1690399 1692649 That's... for our anniversary.
1692693 1694993 My wife does these, treasure hunts.
1695028 1697408 I'm hoping you can tell me what this means.
1697447 1698847 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?
1698866 1701076 It'll help me track Amy's<br />movements before she disappeared.
1701410 1703580 Of course. Okay.
1703620 1706210 "Although this spot couldn't be tighter...
1706957 1709667 "it's a cozy room for my favorite writer."
1712504 1713714 I know this one!
1714214 1717724 <i>Although this spot couldn't be any tighter...</i>
1718343 1721143 <i>it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.</i>
1722639 1726059 <i>After-school meeting, don't mind if I do.</i>
1726101 1729021 <i>Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.</i>
1733066 1735396 Well, well. What does it say?
1735444 1736954 Clue two.
1738071 1741451 "Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.
1741950 1745830 "You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover.
1746330 1747370 "Let's head on over...
1747414 1749294 "To the little brown house.
1749333 1753043 "We'll play hot, doting<br />husband, sweet, loving spouse."
1756089 1756839 These yours?
1757716 1758716 No.
1758759 1760219 But you read the first clue.
1760260 1763390 Randy professor, naughty student.
1763430 1764470 I blush.
1764515 1766275 Me and my ex just swapped cards.
1767476 1768846 Where's this little brown house?
1768894 1770404 I have no idea.
1813605 1814975 Hello?
1815649 1817529 Nicholas Dunne.
1818193 1821283 Under my father's name, William Dunne.
1827703 1831793 My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?<br />Can you just turn the... the bell...
1831832 1832792 yeah, look, I know.
1832833 1835863 It's, um... it's-it's, uh, uh, uh...
1836920 1839210 It's "Puddles," right? Or is it "poodles?"
1843135 1844765 We're good.
1846346 1847466 Hello, stranger.
1847514 1849644 Fancy meeting you here.
1849683 1851983 It's your dad's house, right?
1852019 1853649 Are you following me?
1853687 1854557 What you doing?
1854605 1856775 Like you said, it's my dad's house.
1856815 1859525 I come by once a week, make sure<br />the place hasn't burned down.
1861320 1862610 But, it looks okay.
1863363 1865243 I'll walk you out.
1868493 1869993 You know...
1870037 1873287 I thought maybe this was the little brown house.
1873332 1874542 From the clue.
1874583 1876543 Nope. Still blue.
1893018 1897228 <i>Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad.</i>
1897272 1900982 <i>I need to be punished, and<br />by "punished," I mean "had."</i>
1901485 1904615 <i>It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five.</i>
1904905 1908665 "So open the door, and look alive."
1909952 1910992 Bitch!
1914706 1917706 <i>Want to test your marriage for weak spots?</i>
1918377 1919837 <i>Add one recession...</i>
1920170 1921460 <i>subtract two jobs.</i>
1922047 1924167 <i>It's surprisingly effective.</i>
1924216 1926626 Promise me we'll never be like them.
1926677 1927797 Like who?
1927845 1929605 All those awful couples we know.
1929638 1933598 Those wives who treat their<br />men like dancing monkeys...
1933642 1935102 to be trained and paraded.
1935727 1938437 Husbands who treat their wives<br />like the Highway Patrol...
1938814 1941404 to be out-foxed and avoided.
1946154 1947824 I think I'm gonna be laid off.
1948615 1951405 We're in a recession. If it<br />happens, we'll deal with it.
1951451 1953661 I'll probably be next.
1953704 1954954 We have each other.
1955330 1957870 Everything else is background noise.
1958959 1960749 You are exceptional.
1968468 1969718 My turn.
1971597 1975057 My parents' publisher dropped them,<br />and they're in debt up to their ears.
1975100 1975930 That's terrible.
1975976 1978396 And they need to borrow from my trust fund.
1978437 1979937 How much?
1979980 1982190 Almost a million.
1982774 1984364 That's almost all of it.
1984401 1986701 This is where you say, "Everything<br />else is background noise."
1986737 1987647 Amy, if you're laid off...
1987946 1989196 and I'm laid off...
1989239 1990369 I said I'd do it.
1990407 1991657 Without talking to me?
1991700 1993280 - Well, it's...<br />- Your call.
1993327 1994907 ...their money, technically.
1999333 2001003 You know what? You're right.
2001627 2003627 Everything else is just background noise.
2012596 2013596 Hey.
2017726 2018886 More games?
2018936 2020556 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.
2021772 2023232 What's the laptop for?
2024316 2025316 Laptop-ing.
2027569 2028489 I see.
2028529 2031529 You can give your parents<br />$879,000 without talking to me...
2032074 2034704 but God forbid I buy a video game<br />without getting your permission.
2034743 2035793 You are spending a lot.
2035827 2038077 You don't trust me. You don't trust my judgment.
2038121 2039661 You certainly don't trust my intention.
2039706 2040666 What are you talking about?
2040707 2042327 That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it?
2042376 2044626 Why are you throwing that in my face again?
2044670 2046210 Because it's easy to throw.
2046255 2047055 Nick, I don't get it.
2047089 2050429 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2050467 2053547 The nagging shrew. The controlling bitch.
2053595 2055965 I'm not that person. I'm your wife.
2056014 2057184 I'm sorry.
2057224 2059564 I just don't know how to do this.<br />I've never not had a job.
2059601 2061601 I flipped burgers, I painted houses.
2061645 2063655 You'll get another job.
2068068 2069278 Hi, Go.
2071029 2072779 What? Hold on. What?
2072823 2074243 - <i>And suddenly...</i><br />- Slow down, what is it?
2074283 2076283 <i>...I knew everything was about to get worse.</i>
2076326 2077906 Okay, tell me what's wrong.
2105272 2106772 - Bless you, Nick.<br />- Father.
2107441 2108861 Hey, Tom. Mayor!
2108901 2110151 Nick, good to see you.
2110194 2111194 Good to see you.
2111236 2112486 Hey, guys, hey.
2114907 2116407 - Jodie.<br />- Nick.
2118118 2119738 Oh, we'll find her.
2134718 2136428 You look like hammered shit.
2136470 2138140 Thank you.
2146230 2147690 You ever see that guy in the glasses before?
2148607 2151357 Don't worry. We videotape everybody<br />that comes in and out of these things.
2151401 2153191 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...
2153237 2154277 Do-gooders?
2154321 2155531 Freaks.
2155572 2157532 Hey, I meant to ask you.
2157574 2159034 Noelle Hawthorne?
2159910 2161620 She lives on your street. Amy's best friend.
2162746 2164076 I've never heard the name Noelle Hawthorne.
2164122 2166292 She and her husband have triplets.
2166333 2167213 Oh.
2167626 2170456 Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street.
2170838 2173008 But, "best friend"? No.
2173549 2174759 Excuse me, one sec.
2179054 2181144 He acted like Noelle was a complete stranger.
2181181 2182271 Of course he did.
2182641 2183931 Look, these two are yours.
2183976 2186346 Oh, look. He's being a good guy...
2186395 2188315 So everybody can see him being a good guy.
2188355 2190145 You really don't like him, do you?
2190190 2191690 What's to like?
2213380 2217010 <i>This mailbox is currently full. Press one to...</i>
2217050 2220430 Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.<br />My name's Shawna Kelly.
2220679 2223389 I am so sorry for your troubles.
2223432 2224352 Thank you. That's kind.
2224391 2225811 Are you remembering to eat?
2225851 2226981 Well, a lot of cold cuts.
2227019 2231189 I'm gonna fix you up my<br />world-famous chicken frito pie.
2231231 2232731 That's very kind and very unnecessary.
2232774 2234404 You have to keep your strength.
2234943 2235903 Would you...
2236820 2238700 say, "chicken frito pie!"
2242910 2244200 You know what?
2245454 2246834 Would you delete that picture for me?
2246872 2248752 - It's a nice photo.<br />- I know it is.
2248790 2250210 But just do me a favor.
2250250 2252000 Will you?
2252044 2254964 Would you go ahead and<br />please delete that picture?
2255005 2255665 You just press...
2256048 2257548 What is wrong with you?
2257591 2258981 Could you please not share that with anyone?
2259026 2262256 I will share it with whomever I please.
2266058 2267428 - Dude.<br />- Yeah?
2267476 2268806 Marybeth is pissed.
2269520 2270310 Why?
2273190 2274770 Marybeth?
2274816 2278236 It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king.
2280656 2283116 It was important to my mother that I be polite...
2283158 2285078 I be considerate, I be a gentleman.
2285118 2286828 It looked like you were having fun.
2286870 2289120 I am in a nightmare!
2289831 2292251 All I'm trying to do is be nice...
2292292 2296002 To the people who are<br />volunteering to help find Amy.
2297965 2299725 You're right.
2300592 2302552 And I'm sorry.
2304555 2308185 My God, this place literally smells like feces.
2319152 2322492 In your searches, did you find<br />any golf clubs, real fancy?
2322531 2323951 No.
2325075 2326785 How about a brand new Stratocaster?
2326827 2327947 No, nothing like that.
2328662 2330752 Well, all right.
2335752 2338802 How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.
2338839 2340129 No, it's nowhere near that.
2340174 2341264 Okay.
2341717 2343127 - Kibble?<br />- Excuse me?
2343177 2345257 He asked me to feed his cat.
2345304 2346514 I saw some in the pantry.
2346847 2351597 Detective Boney, officer Gilpin?<br />Noelle Hawthorne!
2351643 2353233 I know y'all are in there!
2353270 2357770 Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne<br />and her children back out to the street?
2358650 2360740 Detective Boney!
2360777 2364607 Just remind her it is a possible crime scene.
2373332 2378172 Look at that pie-eating grin,<br />from a guy whose wife is missing.
2383967 2385547 - How are you doing?<br />- Terrific.
2387304 2388814 How's Marybeth?
2388847 2390677 She's a wreck.
2390724 2392184 And you?
2392809 2394439 Awesome.
2394478 2395438 Hey...
2395479 2397059 Have you told me everything?
2397314 2398274 Of course.
2398315 2399275 Everything?
2399316 2400476 Why would you even ask me that?
2400526 2404696 Ever since you walked into the bar that<br />morning Amy went missing, you seem...
2405989 2406989 - off.<br />- I am off.
2408033 2411373 Everybody's examining me and<br />projecting their shit on me.
2411411 2414831 All I want is to come over<br />here, have a beer with you...
2414873 2416213 and not be judged.
2416250 2417750 Can we do that?
2418836 2420166 Of course.
2421547 2423547 You know what I keep thinking?
2423590 2424630 If mom were here?
2424675 2428095 Yeah. Like I'm 12.
2429555 2432355 Nick, mom would fix it.
2439565 2442785 I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.
2445696 2448026 - Love you.<br />- Love you.
2452369 2454409 So, here's a strange, new sentence.
2454454 2457924 I am a Missourian.
2464715 2466095 Bye, dad.
2468010 2471470 <i>No money, no jobs, no prospects.</i>
2471513 2473683 <i>And then, we heard from Go.</i>
2473724 2475644 <i>Mama Maureen...</i>
2475684 2478524 <i>stage 4 breast cancer.</i>
2480689 2483529 <i>So, we moved to Missouri.</i>
2483567 2485187 <i>I don't mind.</i>
2485235 2488405 <i>I just wish he'd asked.</i>
2500083 2502543 <i>Nick is happy to be home.</i>
2502586 2505086 <i>But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him.</i>
2506590 2509840 <i>I feel like something he loaded by mistake.</i>
2509885 2513055 <i>Something to be jettisoned, if necessary.</i>
2513096 2515306 <i>Something disposable.</i>
2517142 2519772 <i>I feel like I could disappear.</i>
2563772 2565772 Oh, my God!
2565816 2567776 - I saw you on TV.<br />- Okay.
2567818 2569488 - It's so crazy.<br />- Yeah, I know.
2569528 2571738 - She just vanished?<br />- She's just gone.
2571780 2573620 - I've been so worried about you.<br />- Where have you been?
2573657 2575487 I called you a hundred times.<br />You gotta pick up your phone!
2575534 2576584 Rehearsals.
2576618 2577658 What?
2577703 2579003 Godspell.
2580831 2582421 My sister's asleep in the other room.
2582457 2583577 I needed to see you.
2583625 2585285 I know this is a bad idea.
2585335 2586835 Can you at least tell me you love me?
2586879 2590629 I do love you, but we have to<br />be really careful right now.
2590674 2591934 I've been so scared.
2591967 2593177 Between rehearsals?
2593218 2594968 You told me I needed to have my own life.
2595012 2596512 I know.
2596555 2597815 We need to stop.
2597848 2599018 I need you.
2600142 2601982 Touch me.
2605397 2608017 Stop it. Come here.
2609401 2611111 Sit down.
2611153 2612493 Okay.
2612529 2616619 Did you, by any chance, tell<br />anybody anything about us?
2616658 2618158 Even in texting, or on Facebook.
2618202 2621002 Facebook? I use the disposable phone.
2621038 2622958 You buy my presents in cash.<br />I'm not stupid, Nick.
2622998 2625878 I know, sweetie. Did you leave a<br />pair of red panties in my office?
2625918 2629338 I don't know. Maybe. They better be mine.
2629379 2630339 Sweetheart, think.
2630380 2632840 I don't know. I'd have to<br />check my red panty inventory.
2632883 2635513 Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay?
2635552 2637352 This is the last time we're<br />gonna see each other, until...
2637387 2638847 Until when?
2639389 2640849 Until it's safe.
2640891 2642481 You were going to get a divorce.
2642518 2644688 Never say that out loud again.
2644728 2647398 Okay. I'm sorry.
2648273 2649233 I don't wanna fight.
2651276 2652856 I just wanna be with you.
2652903 2654073 Andie, please...
2654905 2656575 That's all I want.
2657908 2658988 I can't.
2661328 2663578 It's our last time together.
2663622 2665672 Let's make the most of it.
2672422 2675762 Real quick, but then you have to go.
2678595 2681385 <i>My husband has come undone.</i>
2681431 2684391 <i>We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...</i>
2684434 2687154 <i>but as it turns out, we couldn't.</i>
2690440 2692190 It means a lot that you came.
2693360 2694740 <i>We took a hit on the brownstone...</i>
2694778 2697108 <i>and I used the last of my<br />trust fund to buy him a bar.</i>
2697865 2700125 <i>So far, it's just costing money.</i>
2704329 2708119 <i>Nick uses me for sex when he wants.</i>
2711295 2713805 <i>Otherwise, I don't exist.</i>
2715048 2717128 We should go to Outback tonight.
2717176 2718426 That would be nice.
2718468 2721548 <i>Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic.</i>
2722472 2725642 <i>I became someone I don't even like.</i>
2725684 2727484 <i>The kind of woman I used to mock.</i>
2727895 2729605 You're out so much.
2729646 2731976 - I know.<br />- Stay home.
2732024 2734364 - I can't, I'm already late.<br />- Then, can I come?
2734401 2736191 You would hate it.
2736236 2739486 It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends.
2740490 2743370 Do our code. No bullshit.
2743827 2746197 I thought we weren't gonna be that couple.
2752711 2754551 Okay, bye.
2756215 2759185 - Hey, I've been thinking.<br />- Yeah?
2759218 2760588 Something positive.
2762012 2763052 Maybe it's time.
2764348 2766178 Now is literally the worst time.
2766225 2767275 It would be a new start for us.
2767684 2770404 And for me, I would have a real purpose here.
2770437 2771647 A child is not a hobby.
2771688 2772688 Not a hobby.
2773690 2774900 An inspiration.
2775442 2778572 We could have had this fight<br />four hours ago. I'm late.
2778612 2779862 I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.
2779905 2783325 You really wanna be the couple that<br />has a baby to save their marriage?
2783367 2784367 "Save"?
2784868 2787038 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!
2787079 2789249 - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br />- Yeah!
2789289 2791829 You're a fucking coward.
2791875 2793745 No, it can't go on like this.
2793794 2794844 Really?
2794878 2796378 - I won't.<br />- You won't?
2796421 2798761 You won't? Why, it's not good enough for you?
2798799 2799719 It's not even close!
2799758 2801888 You stupid bitch!
2802469 2805429 <i>What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me.</i>
2805472 2809312 <i>What scared me was how much<br />he wanted to hurt me more.</i>
2809643 2811733 <i>What scared me was that I'd finally realized...</i>
2812729 2816399 <i>I am frightened of my own husband.</i>
2828287 2829787 You want me to call for backup?
2829830 2831920 Nah, I'll protect you.
2839673 2841093 Jesus.
2846138 2848808 They ought to burn this place down.
2849266 2850926 Seems like folks are trying.
2856440 2858730 You really think this is anything?
2858775 2860935 Cross it off the list.
2872039 2873749 Hey, Jason.
2873790 2875330 What's up, Rhonda?
2875375 2877625 "...and dedicated to the<br />proposition that all men..."
2878712 2881212 - Have you seen this girl around here?<br />- Why do you ask?
2881465 2883305 She was reported missing.
2886470 2888350 "...and so dedicated, can long endure."
2888388 2890308 Yeah. I remember her.
2890349 2892479 What did she want? Weed, pills?
2894144 2895154 She wanted a gun.
2895395 2897435 I told her it's not my thing.
2897481 2900481 I felt bad, though. She seemed really desperate.
2900526 2904106 She said it needed to be small,<br />so she could keep it close.
2904154 2905994 Are you sure this is her?
2906031 2908161 You don't forget a girl like that in here.
2909159 2910659 She was all in pink.
2910702 2913252 It was Valentine's day.
2916208 2918958 <i>For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun.</i>
2919002 2921592 <i>That is how crazy I've become.</i>
2922673 2926803 <i>Nick wants me gone but he<br />won't ask for a divorce.</i>
2926844 2930974 <i>In his mind, I'm the owner of his<br />bar, his only line of credit.</i>
2931014 2932524 <i>The bitch with the prenup.</i>
2934351 2936691 <i>I could go home to my parents...</i>
2936728 2939148 <i>But I'd have to tell them the truth.</i>
2939189 2943029 <i>And I don't even know if I believe the truth.</i>
2943068 2945858 <i>Can I really think Nick would hurt me?</i>
2946488 2948868 <i>I'm being paranoid. Crazy.</i>
2950200 2950870 <i>It's just...</i>
2952160 2954700 <i>I'd sleep better with a gun.</i>
2965591 2967011 Oh, shit.
2967050 2970680 Wake up, baby. Wake up.<br />My sister's gonna come out here.
2975058 2977268 - Sorry to rush you.<br />- It's okay.
2979229 2980729 - Here. Let me help you.<br />- Okay.
2980772 2982862 Just get that.
2985527 2987027 Be very careful.
2987863 2988863 I'm all right.
2988906 2991486 Here you go.
2991533 2993413 Promise me we'll talk every day.
2993452 2994702 Okay, we will.
2994745 2997465 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.
2998248 2999328 Don't go crazy.
2999374 3000634 Okay.
3005047 3008377 You fucking idiot.
3008425 3012255 You fucking asshole! You fucking<br />lied to my fucking face!
3013764 3015314 I'm sorry.
3017100 3018060 How old is she?
3018435 3019635 She's in her early 20s.
3020562 3021402 How long?
3022105 3024895 - A year and a half.<br />- You lied to me for over a year?
3024942 3026612 If I told you, you would have made me stop.
3026652 3028242 It's so fucking small.
3028278 3031238 You're a liar and a cheat! You're just like dad!
3031281 3032571 How did you even meet her?
3032616 3033826 She's one of my students.
3035077 3036747 I thought writers hated cliches.
3036787 3037617 I'm not a writer.
3037663 3039913 "Boo-hoo, I got laid off. I<br />guess I'll fuck a teenager."
3039957 3042747 It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br />no idea how shitty it was with Amy...
3042793 3044713 how fucking terrible she made me feel.
3044753 3047923 Flyover boy. I would get knots in my stomach...
3047965 3049805 just coming home, knowing she<br />would be sitting there...
3049842 3051972 dissatisfied, before I even<br />walked in the fucking door.
3052010 3053430 This is so bad.
3053470 3055560 If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked.
3055597 3058217 Boney found a pair of panties in my office...
3058267 3059807 where, occasionally, Andie and I...
3060269 3061389 I don't know what the fuck it means.
3061436 3062596 Are they super-twat's?
3062646 3064726 Her name is Andie.
3064773 3066273 She's not entirely sure.
3066316 3067976 So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...
3068026 3069436 who isn't sure where she leaves her undies?
3069486 3071736 If they're not Andie's, that<br />means that they're Amy's...
3071780 3073490 and she left them there for me to find.
3073532 3077292 Nick, I was scared for you before,<br />and now, I'm fucking petrified.
3077327 3079617 We're having a vigil tonight<br />for your missing wife...
3079663 3082793 and this morning, you're kissing<br />your college girlfriend goodbye!
3082833 3084003 Can you imagine?
3084626 3087956 Have you watched television lately?
3088005 3091015 Cable news is all over your shit.
3091633 3093473 I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?
3093510 3095800 His wife's nowhere to be found...
3095846 3099516 and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.<br />Cute pic, huh?
3099558 3102018 - Who is that?<br />- Some fucking tragedy groupie.
3102060 3103980 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- I don't know.
3104021 3105151 She was trying to give me a casserole.
3105189 3108319 On the show today we have defense<br />attorney, Tanner Bolt...
3108358 3110898 patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.
3111195 3114705 Tanner Bolt, would you actually<br />consider defending Nick Dunne?
3114740 3115870 Well, let me just say...
3115908 3118658 as always, Ellen, thank you<br />for such a warm welcome.
3118702 3120252 But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.
3120537 3123037 Listen, just because this guy<br />isn't walking around weeping...
3123081 3124501 that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.
3124541 3127881 Tanner, the hallmark of a<br />sociopath is a lack of empathy.
3127920 3129880 But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath...
3130380 3132170 to behave normally in this situation...
3132216 3134966 because it's the most abnormal<br />situation in the world.
3135010 3137680 Tanner, are you trying to<br />tell me that this photo...
3137721 3139971 is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior?
3140015 3142675 I'm so sick of being picked apart by women.
3144061 3145941 You need to hire Tanner Bolt.
3148023 3148823 I don't deserve this.
3148857 3150727 Innocent until proven guilty.
3150776 3153146 That's exactly what you deserve.
3153195 3154745 Go home, Nick.
3180722 3182142 Hey, buddy.
3198031 3199821 I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy.
3199867 3201827 We're not gonna arrest anybody...
3201869 3203369 just because some blonde dunce says so.
3203787 3206287 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3206582 3209922 One, I am conducting an<br />investigation, not a witch-hunt.
3209960 3211880 And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever.
3211920 3213210 She was trying to buy a gun.
3213255 3215425 We don't know who or what was scaring her, Gil.
3215465 3216375 Give me the update.
3216967 3219587 No drug angles panned out yet,<br />so cross that off the list.
3219636 3221596 I talked to the nurses who<br />care for Nick's father.
3221638 3224348 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as<br />a kitten, so cross that off the list.
3224391 3225561 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3225601 3229021 So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br />like the 4th of July.
3229062 3230362 - Whoa.<br />- Yeah.
3230397 3231517 The blood is profuse.
3231565 3233785 It is Amy's, type B, and we should have DNA soon.
3233817 3234897 Thoughts on a weapon?
3234943 3236863 Trajectory indicates blunt force.
3236904 3239244 Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
3239823 3243083 She fell there, but I doubt she got back up.
3243118 3244538 Amy's medical records come in?
3244578 3246578 No, we'll have them later tonight.
3248165 3249585 My wife says he's a killer.
3249833 3252173 Well, if Tiffany says...
3277778 3278778 Hey.
3279112 3280112 Hey.
3284535 3285545 Thank you all for coming out.
3287371 3289001 Hey Donnie, how are you?
3289039 3292379 Rich, thank you so much.
3299675 3300685 Hey.
3307724 3311314 Thank you, folks. Thank you<br />for being here tonight.
3311353 3313153 It just means the world to our family.
3313689 3315149 And to Amy.
3315732 3317732 As you all know...
3318569 3321859 My wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...
3321905 3323405 disappeared three days ago.
3323991 3327541 And I want to implore anyone who<br />has any information at all...
3327578 3330498 please come forward. Help us.
3330539 3331459 So hot.
3331498 3332868 He is so creepy.
3332916 3336376 I wanna say something, because I think<br />some of you might be wondering...
3336420 3338340 and are too polite to ask.
3338839 3341929 I had nothing to do with the<br />disappearance of my wife.
3342509 3344469 I'm cooperating with the police.
3344511 3346551 I haven't hired a lawyer.
3346597 3347717 I have nothing to hide.
3349016 3351516 Amy is my soul mate.
3351768 3353058 She is brilliant...
3353604 3356694 she's charming, and wise.
3357024 3358734 I love you, Amy.
3362863 3363953 Asshole.
3365282 3367202 I love my wife...
3367576 3368786 so much.
3371288 3375628 And I may not behave for the<br />cameras the way they want me to...
3376043 3379253 and if they wanna punish<br />me for that, that's okay.
3379296 3383006 But I just wanna ask you in the<br />media, please, harass me...
3383050 3386090 but don't harass the people of this town.
3386136 3388176 If you need to mock somebody, mock me.
3388222 3389432 Nick!
3389473 3391143 But please don't turn this<br />investigation into a circus.
3391642 3393232 Where's your wife, Nick?
3393268 3394768 Let the police do their jobs.
3395229 3396809 What did you do to your pregnant wife?
3398649 3399899 Did you tell them that, Nick?
3399942 3401992 Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant?
3405739 3407909 Thank you for your support tonight.<br />Let's find Amy.
3410077 3411487 Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something.
3415791 3417171 Gil, go, go.
3419503 3420633 Nick, where are you going?
3420671 3422261 Stop him!
3422297 3424507 No questions right now. Thank you.
3427010 3428550 Why are you running away?
3429638 3431058 Don't run.
3432140 3433140 Everybody, stay back.
3437938 3440108 Guys, come on. You know better.
3440148 3442608 Get off the grass, get down to the curb.
3442651 3444071 - Hey, Gil...<br />- On it.
3444111 3445151 All right.
3445195 3446985 All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.
3447030 3448320 Hello?
3449074 3450624 Hello?
3450659 3451489 Fuck.
3451535 3453045 You scared me. Want a drink?
3453078 3454578 Did you know she was pregnant?
3454621 3456751 I told you, Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.
3456790 3457830 She doesn't even know Amy.
3458500 3459920 They look like pretty good friends to me.
3467676 3471096 Look, I don't know. But it certainly<br />doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
3471138 3472348 We have her medical records coming.
3472389 3474269 - Good.<br />- So, let's talk while we wait.
3474308 3476518 Let's start over here. The scene of the crime.
3476560 3479440 You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions.
3479479 3481439 Dozens and dozens.
3481481 3483691 This area right here, it looked<br />wrong from the second we saw it.
3483734 3486904 The whole thing looked staged. Watch this.
3488822 3492242 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3492659 3494409 I don't know. What do you want me to say?
3494453 3496183 Did you do any housekeeping the<br />day your wife went missing?
3496221 3497081 No.
3497122 3499372 Because our guys did a luminol test.
3499416 3502086 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3502127 3504377 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick. A lot.
3504421 3505381 Oh, my God.
3505422 3506762 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.
3506798 3509258 Wait a second. Why would they mop up the blood...
3509301 3510891 if they're trying to stage a crime scene?
3510928 3513678 No blood and no body suggests kidnapping.
3513722 3516142 It tells us, look at people outside the house.
3516183 3517603 Like these homeless you keep mentioning.
3517643 3520733 A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide.
3520771 3522771 It tells us to look at people inside the house.
3522814 3525534 - Which is what we're doing here, Nick.<br />- I see.
3525567 3528527 So, how was your marriage, Nick? Because<br />right now, all we got is Noelle.
3528570 3530110 She says, "not good."
3530155 3531655 Gil, what do you and your wife argue about?
3531698 3533828 - What pisses you off?<br />- Money, lack thereof.
3533867 3535617 Me and my ex, it's the same.
3535661 3539001 I mention that because we got a<br />look at your finances, Nick.
3539039 3541749 $117,000 in credit card debt.
3541792 3543752 - What?<br />- I pulled up some of the merchandise.
3543794 3545804 There are these fun little splurges.
3545838 3547378 I didn't buy any of this stuff.
3547422 3548552 I don't even golf!
3548590 3549920 I do! You bought great clubs.
3549967 3551257 I like the robot dog.
3551301 3553261 This is identity theft! This is a felony!
3553303 3554363 We need to find out who did this!
3554404 3556064 All right. Let's talk about life insurance.
3556098 3558638 Because in April, you bumped<br />up Amy's life insurance...
3558684 3559684 to $1.2 million.
3559726 3562096 Yes, I did. That was her idea. She wanted me to.
3562145 3563305 You filed the paperwork.
3563355 3564555 Because she told me to!
3565399 3566319 Hold on a sec.
3566358 3568148 Yeah? Okay.
3570070 3571240 For sure?
3571655 3572825 All right.
3576910 3577870 She was pregnant.
3581999 3583629 This is insane.
3583667 3586167 So, my question becomes...
3586211 3589131 I don't want to talk to you again, ever...
3589173 3590343 without a lawyer.
3598682 3599682 Margo!
3610569 3611569 Hey.
3613947 3616367 Just hold on a second. Let me finish.
3616408 3617328 Nick?
3617367 3620157 I hear you, I hear you. I was as surprised as...
3620204 3624044 I know you're upset. I had<br />no idea she was pregnant.
3624458 3627588 Listen, I-I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't...
3630088 3632218 you want to know the truth?
3632257 3634627 The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.
3637054 3639104 Well, I'm as surprised as...
3640432 3642232 You told me you didn't want kids.
3643227 3644597 I was trying to put a good face on.
3644645 3646525 Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife.
3646563 3647903 That's a problem for you.
3647940 3651030 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3651068 3652528 Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!
3652569 3653899 You have to fucking talk to me!
3656573 3660623 I didn't tell you that she didn't want<br />kids because she didn't want me to.
3660661 3662871 Because it would have just been<br />another reason for you to hate her.
3662913 3664793 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just...
3664831 3667041 - Lie to me?<br />- I wanted kids!
3667084 3669254 When we first moved here, I<br />went to a fertility clinic!
3669294 3670964 - It didn't work?<br />- I did my part!
3671004 3672054 Masturbated.
3672089 3673799 When it came time for Amy to do her<br />thing, all of a sudden it was like...
3673841 3675381 "Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."
3675425 3677425 Now, who would believe you?
3678595 3679795 All right.
3689439 3691229 This is a letter from the clinic...
3691275 3693745 notifying me that they're<br />gonna destroy my sample...
3693777 3695777 unless I contact them.
3697030 3698570 So, I gave it to Amy.
3698615 3701615 The next day, I saw it in the trash.
3701660 3703240 But you were already with Andie by then, right?
3703287 3706117 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3706164 3710344 A year ago, Amy being pregnant would<br />have been the best thing ever!
3716884 3718764 "When your poor Amy has a<br />cold, this dessert just..."
3718802 3720182 this is the clue you couldn't solve.
3720220 3721350 Yeah.
3723056 3726426 A letter from Desi. That<br />creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
3726476 3728846 It was the fucking rich guy who<br />would do anything for her.
3728896 3730856 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3730898 3731858 Your prenup?
3732232 3735192 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3735235 3737025 I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!
3739907 3743027 I love you, no matter what.
3743076 3744446 But you need to tell me.
3744494 3745914 Tell you what?
3746747 3748367 What are you asking me?
3749958 3753128 Are you asking me if I killed my wife, Go?
3753587 3755667 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3755714 3758134 I would never ask you that!
3762095 3763095 Margo!
3775901 3778111 Don't walk on the glass.
3779821 3782451 You have no clue, do you?
3800259 3801839 Why was he here that night?
3803470 3806310 His wife is missing. Why come here?
3806348 3807268 Who cares?
3807558 3808808 Rhonda, we got this.
3808851 3810351 Let's make the arrest.
3810394 3812484 Do you know how hard it is to make<br />a murder case without a body?
3812521 3813441 No.
3813480 3815650 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3815691 3818571 So, I want one last thing.
3818610 3819440 What's that?
3821238 3823528 I want a body.
3824700 3829120 <i>Picture me. I'm a girl who's very, very bad.</i>
3829162 3830792 Be careful.
3835335 3839755 <i>I need to be punished, and<br />by "punished," I mean "had."</i>
3844303 3845303 Fuck.
3847264 3850104 <i>It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five.</i>
3851351 3853521 <i>So, open the door...</i>
3853562 3854942 Punish. Wood. Beach.
3854980 3857480 <i>...and look alive.</i>
3860611 3863201 Punish. Wood.
3864364 3865954 Wood.
3898065 3900785 <i>I will practice believing my husband loves me...</i>
3900817 3903237 <i>and will love this baby.</i>
3903904 3907534 <i>That this child might really save our marriage.</i>
3908408 3909868 <i>But I could be wrong.</i>
3916041 3917961 <i>Because sometimes...</i>
3918961 3921171 <i>The way he looks at me...</i>
3922256 3924006 <i>I think...</i>
3924049 3925129 <i>man of my dreams...</i>
3927052 3929142 <i>father of my child...</i>
3929930 3933930 <i>This man of mine may kill me.</i>
3935310 3937310 <i>He may truly...</i>
3938230 3938980 <i>kill me.</i>
3941242 3942122 W-T-F?
3967885 3970475 <i>I am so much happier now that I'm dead.</i>
3975517 3977097 <i>Technically, "missing."</i>
3977936 3979596 <i>Soon to be presumed dead.</i>
3981315 3982445 <i>Gone.</i>
3983400 3986650 <i>And my lazy, lying, cheating,<br />oblivious husband...</i>
3986695 3989985 <i>Will go to prison for my murder.</i>
3991283 3993833 <i>Nick Dunne took my pride and my dignity...</i>
3993869 3996369 <i>and my hope and my money.</i>
3996413 4000003 <i>He took and took from me<br />until I no longer existed.</i>
4000042 4001462 <i>That's murder.</i>
4001502 4004302 <i>Let the punishment fit the crime.</i>
4004880 4007880 <i>To fake a convincing murder,<br />you have to have discipline.</i>
4012095 4015095 <i>You befriend a local idiot.</i>
4018644 4021814 <i>Harvest the details of her humdrum life.</i>
4022189 4025779 <i>And cram her with stories about<br />your husband's violent temper.</i>
4026902 4029202 <i>Secretly create some money troubles.</i>
4029446 4032616 <i>Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.</i>
4035244 4037454 <i>With the help of the unwitting...</i>
4037496 4039496 <i>bump up your life insurance.</i>
4041208 4044378 <i>Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.</i>
4044419 4047709 <i>Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.</i>
4048173 4052803 <i>You need to package yourself so that<br />people will truly mourn your loss.</i>
4052845 4055815 <i>And America loves pregnant women.</i>
4056139 4059139 <i>As if it's so hard to spread your legs.</i>
4059184 4060484 <i>You know what's hard?</i>
4060978 4062938 <i>Faking a pregnancy.</i>
4062980 4065150 <i>First, drain your toilet.</i>
4066859 4069609 <i>Invite pregnant idiot into your home...</i>
4069653 4072163 <i>and ply her with lemonade.</i>
4077327 4079497 <i>Steal pregnant idiot's urine.</i>
4081707 4083207 <i>Voila.</i>
4083250 4087210 <i>A pregnancy is now part of<br />your legal medical record.</i>
4093719 4095049 <i>Happy anniversary.</i>
4097723 4100483 <i>Wait for your clueless husband...</i>
4100517 4102387 <i>to start his day.</i>
4103854 4105314 <i>Off he goes.</i>
4105355 4107515 <i>And the clock is ticking.</i>
4108692 4111192 <i>Meticulously stage your crime scene...</i>
4111862 4115872 <i>With just enough mistakes to<br />raise the specter of doubt.</i>
4117284 4119244 <i>You need to bleed.</i>
4119578 4120288 <i>A lot.</i>
4121205 4122875 <i>A lot, a lot.</i>
4126210 4128040 <i>A head wound kind of bleed.</i>
4128712 4131212 <i>A crime scene kind of bleed.</i>
4134218 4136338 <i>You need to clean poorly...</i>
4136386 4137216 <i>like he would.</i>
4138096 4140596 <i>Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.</i>
4141225 4143815 <i>And leave a little something behind.</i>
4144478 4146228 <i>A fire in July?</i>
4147773 4148863 <i>And because you're you...</i>
4148899 4150149 <i>you don't stop there.</i>
4150567 4152777 <i>You need a diary.</i>
4152819 4155739 <i>Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story.</i>
4156406 4158696 <i>Start with the fairy tale early days.</i>
4158742 4161042 <i>Those are true. And they're crucial.</i>
4161078 4163078 <i>You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.</i>
4163413 4166043 <i>After that, you invent.</i>
4166083 4167043 <i>The spending.</i>
4167084 4168884 <i>The abuse. The fear.</i>
4168919 4171879 <i>The threat of violence.</i>
4171922 4173882 <i>And Nick thought he was the writer.</i>
4174591 4175881 <i>Burn it just the right amount.</i>
4177719 4179599 <i>Make sure the cops will find it.</i>
4184601 4187651 <i>Finally, honor tradition with<br />a very special treasure hunt.</i>
4190232 4193032 <i>And if I get everything right,<br />the world will hate Nick...</i>
4193068 4195778 <i>for killing his beautiful, pregnant wife.</i>
4195821 4198451 <i>And after all the outrage, when I'm ready...</i>
4198490 4200450 <i>I'll go out on the water<br />with a handful of pills...</i>
4200492 4203042 <i>and a pocket full of stones.</i>
4203078 4205868 <i>And when they find my body, they'll know...</i>
4205914 4209214 <i>Nick Dunne dumped his beloved like garbage.</i>
4209251 4211591 <i>And she floated down past all the other...</i>
4211628 4214958 <i>abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.</i>
4216341 4218301 <i>Then, Nick will die, too.</i>
4219178 4221048 <i>Nick and Amy will be gone.</i>
4221096 4223216 <i>But, then, we never really existed.</i>
4223265 4226485 <i>Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be.</i>
4226518 4227268 <i>"Cool girl."</i>
4227978 4231818 <i>Men always use that as their defining compliment.</i>
4231857 4232817 <i>"She's a cool girl."</i>
4233984 4235114 <i>Cool girl is hot.</i>
4235152 4236572 <i>Cool girl is game.</i>
4236612 4237532 <i>Cool girl is fun.</i>
4237946 4240446 <i>Cool girl never gets angry at her man.</i>
4240490 4243120 <i>She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner...</i>
4243785 4246745 <i>and then presents her mouth for fucking.</i>
4246788 4248788 <i>She likes what he likes.</i>
4248832 4252292 <i>So evidently, he's a vinyl<br />hipster who loves fetish manga.</i>
4253337 4256627 <i>If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe...</i>
4256673 4260473 <i>who talks football and endures<br />buffalo wings at Hooters.</i>
4260511 4264101 <i>When I met Nick Dunne, I<br />knew he wanted cool girl.</i>
4264139 4266809 <i>And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try.</i>
4266850 4268850 <i>I wax-stripped my pussy raw.</i>
4269520 4272650 <i>I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies.</i>
4272898 4275688 <i>I ate cold pizza and remained a size two.</i>
4275734 4277694 <i>I blew him semi-regularly.</i>
4279029 4280359 <i>I lived in the moment.</i>
4280656 4283196 <i>I was fucking game.</i>
4283825 4285865 <i>I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.</i>
4286703 4290003 <i>Nick teased out of me things<br />I didn't know existed.</i>
4290040 4293340 <i>A lightness, a humor, an ease.</i>
4293377 4296297 <i>But I made him smarter. Sharper.</i>
4296338 4299968 <i>I inspired him to rise to my level.</i>
4300008 4303758 <i>I forged the man of my dreams.</i>
4306098 4309018 <i>We were happy pretending to be other people.</i>
4309059 4310889 <i>We were the happiest couple we knew.</i>
4312521 4315521 <i>And what's the point of being<br />together if you're not the happiest?</i>
4316191 4318401 <i>But Nick got lazy.</i>
4318443 4320653 <i>He became someone I did not agree to marry.</i>
4320696 4323866 <i>He actually expected me to<br />love him unconditionally.</i>
4324533 4329043 <i>Then he dragged me, penniless, to<br />the navel of this great country...</i>
4329079 4333039 <i>and found himself a newer, younger, bouncier...</i>
4333083 4334083 <i>cool girl.</i>
4336420 4340590 <i>You think I'd let him destroy me<br />and end up happier than ever?</i>
4341091 4342761 <i>No fucking way.</i>
4343135 4344935 <i>He doesn't get to win.</i>
4355272 4359232 <i>My cute, charming,<br />salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy.</i>
4361653 4364113 <i>He needed to learn.</i>
4364823 4367453 <i>Grown-ups work for things.</i>
4367993 4369953 <i>Grown-ups pay.</i>
4371330 4373920 <i>Grown-ups suffer consequences.</i>
4377419 4378629 Wait.
4379004 4381804 I need 20 seconds where you<br />don't judge me, interrupt me...
4381840 4383470 or get angry.
4384927 4386467 Okay.
4390432 4392392 Is that all the stuff from the credit cards?
4392434 4395604 Where do you store goodies for anniversary five?
4395646 4396436 Wood.
4396480 4399610 - Woodshed.<br />- Yeah, my woodshed.
4399650 4402150 That fucking bitch.
4403987 4405317 - I thought...<br />- It's all right.
4405364 4406824 I would have, too.
4410285 4411485 What's that present?
4411537 4413287 I don't know.
4413330 4415290 Let's find out.
4421880 4425800 "Dear husband, I know you think you're<br />moving through this world unseen.
4425843 4427263 "Don't believe that for a second.
4427302 4429352 "I know where you've been, and<br />I know where you're going."
4432808 4434848 "For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip.
4434893 4436773 "Follow the river, up, up, up.
4436812 4439522 "Sit back and relax, because you are done."
4439565 4440985 What's "up, up river"?
4441024 4443194 "Up the river." Prison.
4443235 4445155 Fucking crazy bitch.
4445195 4446815 That's what this is.
4446864 4449164 She's framing me for her murder.
4449199 4450489 You married a complete psychopath.
4450534 4452664 The morning of our anniversary...
4452703 4457003 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4457040 4459500 I couldn't fake it for another year, another day.
4459543 4460463 Then what happened?
4460502 4461802 Before I could say anything, she said...
4461837 4465217 "I need you to go somewhere and<br />really think about our marriage."
4465257 4466507 She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.
4466550 4467840 So you'd have no alibi.
4467885 4470105 She stage-managed me.
4470387 4474057 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4474099 4475639 I went to the beach, I<br />thought about our marriage.
4475684 4477394 I came back and decided I wanted a divorce.
4477436 4478646 And by the time you got home...
4478687 4480227 She was gone.
4480856 4481726 You fuck!
4481773 4483363 She's good.
4484359 4486359 Part of me was relieved...
4486403 4488703 when I thought she was gone.
4493076 4494786 Punch and Judy puppets.
4497789 4500879 Remember, he beats Judy to<br />death and kills that baby.
4500918 4502038 So I'm Punch.
4503045 4505055 Okay. We already knew that,<br />Amy, what's your point?
4506215 4509055 Does Missouri have the death penalty?
4535953 4537373 Hey, neighbor.
4538288 4540668 It's been weeks since I had<br />anyone decent next door.
4541291 4543921 Well, I don't know how decent I feel.
4543961 4547091 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast Death Metal at 4 am...
4547130 4549130 we're gonna be best friends.
4549174 4551264 All right. Nice meeting you.
4551301 4552891 I'm Greta.
4553512 4554802 I'm Nancy.
4554847 4556807 Are you going to the marina?<br />I could use some creamer.
4556849 4558269 I'm sorry. I can't.
4558308 4559518 I've got work to do.
4559810 4561850 All right. See you around!
4562145 4564055 You will.
4610027 4615237 Come on. Show me that darling Nicky smile.
4617034 4618914 You asshole.
4634384 4635894 Hey.
4638680 4640430 Nancy.
4642726 4644556 Nancy.
4645562 4647772 It's hot again today.
4650067 4651897 So, where are you from?
4652402 4653572 Let me guess.
4656698 4657528 Nebraska.
4659910 4661120 New Orleans.
4664581 4667081 You know, I am an expert oiler.
4667125 4668915 Oh, I just bet you are.
4668961 4671591 Lotions and balms. Ointment.
4672297 4674217 I would hate for y'all to get tan lines.
4674258 4676258 So sweet.
4677094 4679764 Okay. You know where I'll be.
4682641 4685061 I see we have the same taste in men.
4686770 4689020 I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.
4689064 4692114 Least you could do is not<br />keep his secrets for him.
4693151 4694531 Let me guess.
4694570 4698450 He's trying to watch the big<br />game and you just won't shut up.
4698740 4701580 No, you don't seem like much of a talker.
4701618 4702578 I got it.
4702619 4705079 You caught your boy rubbing up<br />on some hot little skank...
4705122 4706832 and he apologized to you<br />by busting you a good one.
4709501 4710291 Worse.
4710627 4711627 Worse?
4712462 4716172 I went to the bar where he works to surprise him.
4716216 4720926 And out he comes with this girl who<br />had no business being in a bar.
4723891 4725891 <i>On the very first night that we met...</i>
4726143 4730313 <i>We walked by a bakery that was<br />having their sugar delivered.</i>
4731148 4733528 <i>And it was in the air, everywhere.</i>
4733567 4735857 <i>A sugar storm.</i>
4735903 4738033 <i>And before he kissed me...</i>
4738071 4740161 <i>he leaned in...</i>
4741658 4743948 <i>and did this.</i>
4754630 4757090 - And guess what.<br />- What?
4757132 4758842 He did the exact same thing with her.
4763096 4766096 That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard.
4766141 4767851 Thank you.
4782616 4784196 Thanks very much.
4790999 4793289 Well, we've gone mainstream.
4808892 4812022 It's an appeals process, so we<br />will attempt to appeal to them.
4812062 4814192 Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?
4816066 4817476 Nick Dunne.
4817526 4819816 I have been sitting by the phone, my friend.
4823282 4824532 I'm sorry.
4824575 4826415 Do you not believe me?
4826451 4829701 No, I believe you. It's just the<br />craziest thing I've ever heard.
4829746 4833076 I love it. But, for you, it sucks.
4833792 4837092 But you gotta have a grudging respect<br />for your wife at this point, right?
4837129 4838709 - Are you laughing me out of the building?<br />- No!
4838755 4840505 Are you kidding me? I'm in.
4840549 4842009 I'm way in.
4842050 4844680 You came to the right guy.<br />This is what I do, Nick.
4844720 4848140 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.<br />I win the unwinnable cases.
4848182 4849852 $100,000?
4849892 4851432 We'll figure something out.
4851476 4852476 I'll give you a special...
4852519 4855439 "My wife is skilled in the<br />art of vengeance," rate.
4855480 4856520 Okay.
4856565 4858195 So, what's the plan?
4858233 4860113 Well, right now, it's a "he said, she said."
4860152 4862612 - She's telling a better story.<br />- No, Nick.
4862654 4864494 She is telling the <i>perfect</i> story.
4864781 4868081 So, we need to start today to prepare<br />your defense, should we need it.
4868118 4870498 - And if we decide to go with your version of...<br />- the truth.
4871413 4874753 Then we'll need to realign the<br />public's perception of Amy.
4874791 4877041 Make them stop seeing her<br />as America's sweetheart...
4877085 4880415 and see her for what she is, which<br />a mind-fucker of the first degree.
4880839 4884799 Now, that is a huge realignment. We'll<br />need other voices besides yours.
4884843 4887103 There has to be someone out there<br />that she's screwed with in the past.
4887137 4890217 There's a New York guy. O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
4890265 4892635 Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him.
4892684 4894854 That should be easy to find.
4895395 4898765 Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.
4898815 4900395 She said that he stalked her. He's in St. Louis.
4901985 4904235 You go talk to Tommy, and<br />I'll draw up the contract.
4908534 4911544 I told you, you came to the right guy.
4913747 4914957 Apparently.
4924007 4925797 Tommy?
4925843 4927393 Yeah.
4927803 4929763 - Thanks for seeing me.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4932850 4934560 You're gonna want a drink.
4935102 4936442 Yeah.
4936478 4939268 So, she said you got physical with her.
4939314 4942284 No, dude, she said I raped her.
4942317 4944687 First degree, felony rape.
4945445 4947155 - Did you do it?<br />- Did you do it?
4948323 4950413 I was looking at 30 years to life.
4950951 4952491 - Did you get a trial?<br />- Fuck, no.
4952536 4954746 Do I look like I would do well in the yard?
4954788 4957708 I pled down, man. Sexual<br />assault one, no jail time.
4958125 4959795 - That's something.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4959835 4961255 I've been unemployed for the last eight years...
4961295 4963805 because I have to write "sexual<br />offender" on every job application.
4963839 4966799 I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because<br />I have to register as a predator.
4966842 4970182 I haven't had a date in almost a decade,<br />because if a girl googles me...
4972139 4974059 Could you walk me through what happened?
4974349 4977479 I meet Amy at this party, you know?
4977519 4979149 We click. She's perfect.
4979188 4981518 She's beautiful, she's smart, she's well-read...
4981565 4983865 She's got an ass like a 20-year-old stripper.
4983901 4985091 I think, "What's the catch?"
4985136 4988906 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4989273 4992323 Okay. Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?
4992659 4996119 She annexed me. She made me her business.
4996163 4999963 It was just too much. She<br />went out and bought me ties.
5000000 5002210 And we must have gone 20 rounds over that.
5002252 5005012 Ties. I mean, everything. The<br />whole thing just became...
5005047 5008837 - So, you broke up with her.<br />- No, I just backed away.
5008884 5011684 Gave her some space. No big deal, right?
5011720 5013390 So I thought.
5013430 5015720 Then one night, Amy comes over to my place...
5015766 5018686 with a bottle of bourbon and a<br />bootleg of this band I love.
5018727 5021727 And within two minutes, she's got<br />my pants around my ankles...
5021772 5023362 and she is kneeling down, and...
5023398 5025398 I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.
5025442 5027322 - You had sex?<br />- Yeah, consensual.
5027361 5029451 It was rough, but she was screaming for it.
5029905 5032245 Next morning, there's two cops at my door.
5032574 5035494 Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape.
5035536 5038706 Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen.
5038747 5042417 It looks like I've tied Amy<br />to my bed, and raped her.
5042459 5043919 Me!
5043961 5045711 And then, guess what they find.
5045754 5047804 Headboards of my bed, one on each side.
5048215 5049555 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5049591 5050931 You do know your wife.
5051593 5053433 - Did you ever see her again?<br />- Yeah.
5053470 5054890 On TV, last week, with you.
5055472 5056892 I thought, "There's Amy.
5056932 5060942 She's graduated from being<br />raped to being murdered."
5064773 5065943 You been watching this, too?
5065983 5067193 <i>Last night's bombshell.</i>
5067234 5068284 We just found out...
5068318 5071148 <i>Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,<br />pregnant when she went missing.</i>
5071655 5074625 <i>Kelly Capitono, this makes me wanna throw up.</i>
5074658 5077618 <i>What is it about a pregnant woman, a<br />woman carrying life inside her...</i>
5077661 5079121 <i>that turns men into animals?</i>
5079162 5080662 <i>Ellen, this is an epidemic.</i>
5080956 5083206 <i>The third leading cause of<br />death, among pregnant women...</i>
5083250 5085630 <i>is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband.</i>
5085669 5088549 <i>Let's not forget about the wife, ever.</i>
5088589 5092629 <i>Tonight, we welcome Amy's best<br />friend, Noelle Hawthorne.</i>
5092676 5095046 <i>Thanks for being on the show, Noelle.</i>
5095095 5096385 <i>Thank you, Ellen.</i>
5096430 5097930 <i>And let me just say this...</i>
5097973 5101563 <i>Amy would have loved you,<br />and all you do for women.</i>
5101602 5102642 <i>Oh, that's nice.</i>
5102686 5104806 <i>Why don't you tell us about your friend, Noelle?</i>
5104855 5107405 <i>Amy was... so nurturing.</i>
5107441 5109821 Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like...
5109860 5111150 "She was a real rag."
5113655 5116235 <i>She was beautiful and smart and kind.</i>
5116283 5118333 Seems like a rich bitch to me.
5118368 5120998 What do you mean? People love her.
5121038 5123458 I don't know. She seems uppity.
5125167 5127667 Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole.
5127711 5128921 Paid the ultimate price.
5128962 5132422 <i>The only secret was her husband.<br />We never met Nick.</i>
5132466 5134086 <i>He never introduced himself.</i>
5134134 5136514 <i>Why was that, Noelle? Why do you think?</i>
5136553 5137553 <i>I think we know why.</i>
5138347 5140597 <i>Because he had a violent temper.</i>
5140641 5141681 A little harsh.
5141725 5143305 That's life, baby.
5143352 5144742 <i>And he knew I'd have seen right through him.</i>
5145854 5147194 I mean, don't get me wrong.
5147231 5149111 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
5149149 5152569 I'm just saying, there are consequences.
5154696 5155696 Fuck, yeah.
5155739 5158159 <i>She was so alone.</i>
5158200 5160120 <i>And she was so innocent.</i>
5160160 5163620 <i>You're a good friend, Noelle. And<br />you're a good friend of the show.</i>
5163664 5164874 <i>Thanks for coming on.</i>
5164915 5166375 Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.
5166416 5168706 Tanner Bolt landed me.
5168752 5172052 I'm gonna try and see Desi<br />Collings on my way home.
5172089 5174049 And, Go...
5174091 5177261 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5177719 5179179 That's just the retainer.
5179555 5183185 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
5183225 5186315 <i>I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house.<br />We will go from there.</i>
5186353 5188103 Thank you.
5188856 5190516 - I love you.<br />- I love you, too.

5193360 5195570 <i>Number of times he visited last year? One.</i>
5195612 5196572 Oh, fuck!
5196613 5199323 <i>His twin sister, Margo, well, she is a peach.</i>
5199366 5201696 <i>These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.</i>

5204454 5205584 What the fuck?
5205622 5208292 <i>You know, twin siblings often enable and abet.</i>
5208792 5210632 <i>While I never examined Nick, or his sister...</i>
5211420 5213550 <i>They both seem very, very close.</i>
5213881 5215131 It's twin-cest.
5215465 5218175 <i>Disturbingly close, Lauren.</i>
5218218 5220218 <i>And so, we close with a question.</i>
5220262 5221762 <i>What kind of moral rot...</i>
5221805 5226515 <i>allows a beautiful, talented,<br />kind, smart, loving mother...</i>
5226560 5230270 <i>to vanish without the heavens<br />hearing our outraged cries?</i>
5230314 5231364 Can I bum a cigarette?
5231398 5235148 <i>Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about<br />you, and we will not forget.</i>
5235652 5237862 <i>And you know what else we won't forget?</i>
5237905 5240285 <i>Missouri has the death penalty.</i>
5240324 5241494 Amen.
5267351 5269641 I'd like to report some strange activity...
5269686 5273186 near the woodshed on the<br />property of one Margo Dunne.
5314398 5315858 Hey.
5321405 5323535 - Mr. Dunne.<br />- Mr. Collings.
5324533 5327623 I know you. I saw you at the volunteer center.
5327661 5329371 I wanted to help.
5330163 5331873 I hope you don't mind me coming by.
5331915 5334995 I got your address from this<br />letter that you wrote my wife.
5335878 5339378 Amy and I believe in the<br />lost art of letter-writing.
5339423 5343263 I always wondered why you kept in touch after...
5343927 5345217 Everything.
5345262 5347682 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5347723 5349893 She was my first serious girlfriend.
5349933 5352733 - Why did you break up?<br />- That's a strange question.
5352769 5354729 Did you treat her bad? Did you cheat on her?
5354771 5355981 That's a rude question.
5356023 5357733 Let me tell you what Amy told me.
5357774 5360744 She dumped you, you completely unraveled.
5360777 5362857 You stalked her, you threatened her...
5362905 5366415 and you attempted suicide in her<br />bed and were institutionalized.
5366450 5370370 Your wife is missing, and you came<br />all this way to tell me this?
5370412 5372622 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5376293 5378133 Mr. Collings.
5380214 5382134 Fuck.
5387763 5390773 <i>...the missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.</i>
5390807 5394477 <i>She is the beautiful blonde inspiration<br />for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.</i>
5411662 5413872 You're reading that diary again?
5413914 5414964 You know how it ends.
5414998 5417458 It interests me.
5417501 5419091 Hey, Rhonda.
5419127 5421047 "He's gonna kill me." The end.
5421088 5423208 Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?
5423257 5424377 It's private. There's no one there.
5424424 5427224 Why didn't he make sure it actually burned?
5427261 5430221 Because he tripped the alarm. You<br />were up his ass with a flashlight.
5430264 5432604 The whole thing just feels hinky.
5432641 5434731 Like finding an envelope marked "clue."
5434768 5435888 You ever hear the expression...
5435936 5437686 "The simplest answer is often the correct one"?
5438480 5440480 Actually, I've never found that to be true.
5440524 5442324 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
5444987 5445987 Hey.
5455455 5457325 Elvis is in Missouri.
5457374 5459504 Thank God. Come on in.
5459543 5461963 First thing you have to understand<br />about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.
5462546 5465006 - Play God.<br />- Yeah, old testament God.
5465048 5466088 Okay. Keep talking.
5466133 5467843 She finds out I've been<br />cheating on her with Andie...
5467885 5469475 decides to teach me a lesson.
5469511 5471431 Fakes her own death, frames me for it.
5471471 5473681 Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance.
5473724 5474934 She does the treasure hunt.
5474975 5476315 Now, the treasure hunt is critical.
5476351 5480021 She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities.<br />Rubbing my nose in it.
5480063 5482113 And she leaves clue number one for the police...
5482149 5483859 Which will lead them back to my office...
5483901 5486441 which is a place where Andie and I would often...
5486486 5487816 and she leaves a pair of red panties.
5487863 5489033 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5489072 5490782 - Clue two.<br />- My father's house.
5490824 5493204 Another place where Andie and I<br />would occasionally have relations.
5493243 5494623 - Clue three?<br />- Woodshed.
5494661 5496161 - Also a location...<br />- Oh, my God.
5496205 5497965 - We had limited options.<br />- A hotel.
5497998 5500298 - Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br />- Put it on Andie's credit card.
5500342 5501882 - Andie's statement went right to her parents.<br />- Ew!
5501919 5504459 Nick, Margo, can we head over<br />to the little brown house?
5504505 5506305 - This leads us to what?<br />- My dad's house.
5506340 5508090 Dad's house is blue.
5509384 5512434 After the divorce, when dad<br />wasn't coming around...
5512763 5517023 I used to pretend that he was<br />a spy named Mr. Brown, who...
5517059 5520729 for the sake of his children's<br />safety, had to deny their existence.
5520771 5522191 You never told me that.
5522439 5524229 You told her that?
5524274 5526574 We've got incriminating red<br />panties in your office.
5526902 5529282 We've got a showcase showdown<br />worth of crap in your woodshed.
5530405 5533735 So, what in God's name is at<br />your father's house, Nick?
5533784 5534874 And be honest.
5534910 5536750 I honestly have no idea.
5543919 5547629 Whatever they found, I think it's<br />safe to assume that it's very bad.
5549466 5551716 We got a lot of uncontained issues here.
5551969 5555059 Nick, do you have any idea as<br />to what Andie's mindset is?
5556265 5558065 We haven't communicated since the vigil.
5558100 5559430 Okay. Amy's parents?
5559476 5561056 - No, it's...<br />- More pressure.
5561103 5564363 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who<br />will no doubt go public at any moment.
5564398 5565898 - No, Andie won't do that.<br />- She will.
5565941 5567651 They always do. Don't take it personally.
5568151 5570321 Amy's got us in an interesting bind.
5570654 5572954 - We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br />- Really?
5572990 5575160 Right now, Andie just gives you another motive.
5575993 5577363 We need to tell the cops about the woodshed.
5577452 5578872 We need to be on the front end of that.
5578912 5581252 But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen.
5581832 5583042 They'll go after Margo.
5583083 5584083 They can't do that, can they?
5584126 5586036 She's your accomplice. She<br />helped you hide the evidence.
5586086 5588166 In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy.
5589089 5590509 God.
5590841 5592931 Well, what are we going to do?
5592968 5593838 We find Amy.
5594261 5596601 No. Any other strategy is missing the point.
5596638 5598968 I've got two ex-Secret Service<br />guys that are really good.
5599016 5600636 I'll put them on it.
5600684 5602104 But where do they start, Nick?
5602477 5603597 Where would Amy go?
5605772 5607402 I have no idea.
5611862 5614492 Are we keeping score?
5615157 5616527 Hey!
5618160 5621330 I thought we were steering<br />clear of men for a while.
5621371 5622331 He's nice.
5622372 5624872 Because he wants to fuck you.
5626502 5628042 She's still moping about her ex?
5629838 5632508 He got cheated on, too.
5635886 5638756 We three are the saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.
5638805 5640345 I'm not sad.
5640891 5641851 I'm angry.
5641892 5643692 There you go.
5643727 5646347 I almost drank myself to<br />death when my wife left me.
5646396 5648646 I was gonna kill myself. Can you believe that?
5648690 5649820 Don't give him the pleasure.
5649858 5652988 I was going to drown myself<br />in the Gulf of Mexico...
5653028 5655528 let myself be dinner for the great whites.
5655572 5657372 Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.
5657407 5661327 Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.
5661370 5663830 Please put that on a t-shirt.
5672381 5674761 Miss moneybags. I thought<br />you said you were broke.
5676260 5677550 That's a fat wad.
5679346 5681136 It's mostly singles.
5681181 5683061 Singles? What are you, a stripper?
5683851 5686441 Swamp girls, or treasure chest?
5687563 5688613 We're just teasing.
5689398 5691188 Don't they tease people down in NOLA?
5693610 5696570 <i>We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest any day now.</i>
5696613 5700333 <i>We've got blood in the house,<br />huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.</i>
5700367 5704327 <i>And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,<br />missing for five days...</i>
5704371 5706501 <i>Crying out for justice.</i>
5707291 5709001 <i>We'll be right back.</i>
5761261 5763851 Tanner has a very bad idea<br />he's going to pitch you.
5763889 5764679 Yeah?
5764723 5766313 You're doing Sharon Schieber<br />tomorrow, in St. Louis.
5766350 5767350 It could go so wrong.
5767392 5769142 And you are going to tell her about Andie.
5769186 5770476 Nope.
5770521 5772521 That sounds like a very bad idea.
5772564 5774654 You haven't heard from her in three days.
5774691 5778401 This is a ticking time bomb.<br />You've gotta throw yourself on it.
5778445 5780985 - People are gonna hate me.<br />- And then, they will forgive you.
5781031 5783491 A guy admitting that he's a<br />gigantic asshole on television?
5783534 5785204 People empathize with that.
5786620 5788540 - Why don't we just put out a statement?<br />- They need to see you.
5788580 5791670 Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers.
5791708 5794208 She is a crusader. If she<br />takes you on as a cause...
5794253 5796173 she's going to ask real questions.
5796213 5798053 I will drill you as if you<br />were doing a deposition.
5798090 5799550 What to say, what not to say.
5799591 5800721 A trained monkey?
5800759 5802799 A trained monkey who doesn't get lethal injection.
5804137 5807597 Nick, this case is about<br />what people think of you.
5807641 5809391 They need to like you.
5809434 5813274 Now, you do this and you will<br />reach millions of those people.
5814439 5816939 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5826410 5827200 Hello?
5827244 5828454 Hey, baby.
5829913 5831503 One minute.
5840257 5841717 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
5841758 5842718 You clearing out?
5842759 5844589 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5844636 5846216 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5846263 5847313 I'll come by before...
5847347 5849097 let us give you a hand.
5855272 5857732 Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here.
5859401 5862111 Dorothy is a real stickler.
5863447 5866737 Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind.
5869328 5870788 Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.
5873415 5874415 A sock, or...
5875334 5878134 undies... or what have you.
5882966 5884296 You did a real good job.
5886303 5888433 Where is the money, sweetheart?
5892100 5892850 Look under her dress.
5894645 5895905 He talked you into this?
5895938 5897268 I talked him into it.
5897314 5899324 The second you leave, I'm calling the cops.
5899816 5903486 Your glasses are fake. Your<br />hair's dyed all hamster.
5903529 5906609 You say your name's Nancy, but you<br />don't even answer to it half the time.
5906657 5909117 You're hiding. I don't know<br />why, and I don't really care.
5909159 5911199 But you ain't gonna call the cops.
5911537 5913537 And I don't think you've<br />ever really been hit before.
5919837 5921837 Holy shit.
5924883 5927683 Sorry, but we really need the money.
5927719 5929349 Next place, be more careful, okay?
5929388 5931558 There are a lot of people out<br />there a lot worse than we are.
5966341 5967971 Excuse me. You can't sleep here.
5995579 5998669 I did not kill my wife.
5999666 6002956 Why don't you try it again? A little less wooden.
6003003 6004093 I didn't kill my wife.
6005923 6007633 - What are you doing?<br />- Every time you look smug...
6007674 6010344 or annoyed, or tense, I'm gonna<br />hit you with a gummy bear.
6010385 6012345 - That's supposed to make me less tense?<br />- Let's try it again.
6012387 6015677 Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,<br />you and your wife had some bumps.
6016725 6020685 Yeah, we had some tough years. I lost my job.
6020729 6021729 You both did.
6024441 6026321 We both lost our jobs.
6026360 6028900 I had to move back home so we<br />could take care of my mother...
6028946 6031486 who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had...
6031532 6033282 Your dad's scorched earth.
6033325 6034995 Let's talk about your mom, how close you were.
6035035 6036195 Go on.
6036245 6038755 For awhile, things had been building up.
6038789 6042289 "Built up" implies that an<br />explosion is coming. No.
6042334 6044754 At a certain point, we got on the wrong track.
6045587 6047207 I had a moment of weakness.
6047256 6049666 Your "moment," was over 15 months.
6053470 6055560 I disrespected my wife.
6056223 6058643 And I disrespected my marriage.
6059101 6060481 And I'll always regret it.
6061228 6062058 That works.
6062104 6064524 Don't be afraid to play up the<br />dufus husband thing, Nick.
6064565 6066275 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.
6066316 6067146 "Everything I do is wrong."
6067192 6069242 I know. What men are supposed to do in general.
6071363 6072413 - Thank you.<br />- How do you feel?
6072447 6075657 I feel good. Go, can you<br />pass me that box, please?
6076076 6078696 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me.
6078745 6079745 You hate that watch.
6079788 6081868 No, Go. I love that watch.
6081915 6083915 Just like I love this tie.
6083959 6087089 Just like I love my wife.
6117451 6118831 It's you!
6118869 6120869 It's you.
6121705 6123705 I'm sorry.
6124374 6125714 I'm sorry.
6126627 6128627 Good God.
6128670 6130050 Last week...
6130547 6135717 I threatened to leave, and he said<br />he'd find me and he'd kill me.
6136053 6138223 So, I disappeared.
6139389 6141219 I lost the baby.
6141725 6143515 I couldn't even tell my parents.
6143560 6147480 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.
6148232 6149402 Well, he is looking for you.
6150067 6152027 He showed up on my doorstep three days ago.
6152069 6154569 He tracked me from my letters to you.
6155697 6156907 You saved them.
6157491 6158531 Knowing you were out there...
6158575 6161195 Was the only thing that's kept<br />me going these past few years.
6161245 6162725 Let's go to the police. You<br />can explain everything.
6162763 6163963 No, I can't turn up now.
6163997 6167077 I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.
6168919 6171209 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?
6171255 6173095 He should go to prison for what he's done.
6175926 6178386 I'm setting you up at my lake house.
6178428 6179428 It's utterly secluded.
6180848 6182678 Why are you so good to me?
6182724 6184064 You know why.
6184101 6185231 Excuse me.
6185269 6186389 I know you, don't I?
6186436 6187226 No.
6187271 6189231 You're one of the Nolan girls, right?
6189273 6192153 No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.
6192192 6193072 We should leave.
6193110 6194190 Just a second.
6194778 6198028 That was Boney. I'll call her later.
6198073 6199953 Tanner. Nice to see you.
6200242 6201372 Sharon! Hi.
6201410 6203080 Hope this is worth my while.
6203120 6204250 You're gonna be very happy.
6204705 6205505 Sharon.
6205539 6207749 Ms. Schieber. Thank you so much for doing this.
6207791 6209921 Can I get you anything to drink<br />or eat before we get started?
6209960 6211960 No, I had some gummy bears.
6213046 6214626 What the fuck?
6215799 6216929 I'm sorry?
6217342 6221222 <i>We have a major shocking development<br />in the Amazing Amy disappearance.</i>
6221263 6222643 <i>We go live to that story now.</i>
6222681 6223971 Oh, my God.
6226143 6227943 Oh, you little slut.
6227978 6230978 <i>My name is Andie Fitzgerald.</i>
6231982 6233652 <i>I met Nicholas Dunne...</i>
6233692 6237322 <i>when he was my creative writing<br />teacher at Mill Valley.</i>
6237362 6239452 Why is she dressed like a babysitter?
6239489 6240949 <i>I am deeply ashamed...</i>
6240991 6244121 <i>of having been romantically<br />involved with a married man.</i>
6244161 6246081 The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.
6246121 6248121 <i>I truly believed we were in love.</i>
6248165 6250005 Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite.
6251502 6252962 <i>I know that is no excuse.</i>
6253003 6254303 No, it is not.
6254338 6258678 <i>I do not, in my heart, believe Nick<br />Dunne would have killed for me.</i>
6258717 6261137 <i>My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy.</i>
6261178 6264178 <i>I apologize for the pain this has caused them.</i>
6269394 6271354 <i>We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.</i>
6272189 6273569 <i>That love ended today.</i>
6273857 6275477 Come on, you're staring at ghosts.
6275526 6278186 <i>He met our trust with lie after lie.</i>
6278529 6280449 <i>We now absolutely believe...</i>
6280489 6282869 <i>Nick is involved in the<br />disappearance of our daughter.</i>
6282908 6285158 <i>Our Amazing Amy.</i>
6286036 6288156 This just got very exciting.
6288872 6290582 We need a moment.
6292584 6294344 We're gonna have to bow out of this.
6294378 6296168 - Nothing has changed.<br />- Everything has changed.
6296213 6298633 An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?
6298674 6300304 - I can handle this.<br />- We're on the defense.
6300342 6302392 This is a completely different dynamic.
6302427 6305177 - I can handle it.<br />- She's going to eat you alive.
6305722 6307392 Just trust me.
6311770 6313150 Okay.
6313188 6314268 Great.
6315107 6316567 Mic him.
6336295 6338095 One, two, three, four, five.
6344428 6345098 Thank you.
6346597 6347887 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.
6347931 6348931 Yeah, no kidding.
6353604 6356734 Roll tape. Five... four...
6356773 6358403 three... two...
6360611 6363531 Seriously, I can't believe<br />how fucking good you were.
6363572 6365032 - Amy brings out the best in me.<br />- Don't.
6365073 6368243 Alright, keep it together, you two.<br />At least for the next 24 hours.
6368285 6370705 People still hate you. Women<br />want to scratch your eyes out.
6370746 6372616 Andie was really good TV.
6372664 6374714 - She's a good person.<br />- Well, therein lies the problem.
6374750 6375750 Ride this out...
6375792 6378802 and when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll<br />be looking at a whole new you.
6378837 6380417 But, until then...
6380464 6382424 don't show your face.
6382466 6384296 No problem.
6400609 6401989 Welcome.
6403987 6405817 Make yourself at home.
6405864 6409834 I've got music, satellite...
6409868 6410828 Netflix.
6410869 6411949 <i>He was her teacher!</i>
6411995 6412785 Roku.
6413539 6416039 Internet, obviously.
6416625 6419345 <i>Here is a supposedly grown man...</i>
6419378 6423168 if there is ever anything you have a<br />taste for and you can't find it...
6423215 6425475 just let me know and I will get it for you.
6425509 6428639 <i>Instead of the a-b-c's, he taught<br />her the birds and the bees.</i>
6428679 6431599 <i>And just think how her mother<br />must feel at a time like this.</i>
6431640 6433640 Wine cellar's downstairs.
6437104 6438484 I'll get you some clothes, too.
6438522 6441942 Not that I don't appreciate bait shop chic.
6443110 6445610 The floors are heated, just dial to your liking.
6445654 6448824 There's robes and towels. The shower has steam.
6448866 6451196 The bathtub has a massage cycle.
6453036 6455076 There's a great view, if you're in the mood.
6455122 6456662 Blackout curtains if you're not.
6456707 6459167 The bed is Savoir.
6459209 6461459 You'll never get a better sleep.
6465340 6467680 This is just what I need.
6469136 6471046 I'm so exhausted.
6472556 6474716 I'll leave you to it, then.
6476476 6479226 Amy, I am so happy that you are here.
6480230 6483360 And I don't want you to worry, for one moment.
6483400 6485360 There are cameras everywhere.
6485402 6488282 The exterior, all along the<br />grounds, the entryway.
6488322 6488992 Anyone...
6489489 6491739 who is caught coming, or going...
6494995 6496585 will be recorded.
6498165 6500885 You are more than safe.
6502836 6506336 And I am not letting you get away again.
6552094 6553684 - Good morning!<br />- Don't do that!
6555430 6556560 I'm sorry.
6558559 6560059 I need to feel safe.
6560394 6563404 You are very safe.
6565607 6567227 - What have you been up to?<br />- Nothing.
6567276 6569986 Amy, I'm not Nick.
6570028 6572028 It's hard for me.
6574950 6578580 After so many years under someone's thumb...
6580831 6582121 I know just what that feels like.
6583041 6585041 You were never under my thumb.
6585627 6587667 - On your leash.<br />- Never.
6587713 6589213 A new start.
6590507 6592127 Decent clothes.
6593051 6595301 Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.
6595596 6597096 There's a gym overlooking the lake.
6597472 6601022 The sooner you look like yourself, the<br />sooner you'll feel like yourself.
6601059 6604189 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br />Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.
6604229 6606769 I think that's something I<br />should watch on my own.
6607191 6608901 Nonsense.
6612529 6613949 I'll be back.
6615574 6617744 And I am looking forward...
6617784 6620704 to my reunion with Amy Elliott.
6643894 6645064 Great.
6646104 6648194 <i>Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.</i>
6648232 6649862 - <i>Tonight, exclusively...</i><br />- Hurry up.

6666583 6669173 <i>I probably am. And I probably deserve it.</i>
6669211 6670801 I bought that tie.
6670838 6672878 <i>Did you kill your wife, Nick?</i>
6672923 6676013 <i>I did not kill my wife.</i>
6676677 6678217 <i>I am not a murderer.</i>
6678262 6680182 <i>But you were unfaithful.</i>
6680222 6682432 <i>I was unfaithful.</i>
6682474 6684144 <i>And I am deeply ashamed.</i>
6684184 6686524 <i>And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents...</i>

6689606 6694526 <i>believe you were a loving husband,<br />desperate to find his missing wife.</i>

6696488 6699488 <i>You say that, but I'm wondering how<br />you expect us to believe you...</i>

6701535 6704665 <i>I didn't come forward with my affair...</i>

6723682 6725432 <i>I broke the vow that I made to her.</i>
6725684 6728234 <i>Those are pretty words, Nick.</i>
6728562 6730312 <i>But what does that really mean to you?</i>
6730355 6732395 <i>It basically means that I was a con artist.</i>
6733358 6736568 <i>I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.</i>
6736612 6738202 <i>I was completely transfixed.</i>
6738655 6740565 <i>Amy can do that to you.</i>
6740616 6743156 <i>I was this average guy, from an average place...</i>
6743202 6745202 <i>with mediocre aspirations.</i>
6745245 6747745 <i>And I met a woman who dazzled me.</i>
6747789 6749749 <i>And I wanted her to love me...</i>
6749791 6752131 <i>so I pretended to be better than I was.</i>
6753003 6756673 <i>When we got married, I promised to be that guy.</i>
6756715 6758545 <i>That guy who works harder.</i>
6758592 6760802 <i>That guy who, who lives and acts...</i>
6760844 6763764 <i>and loves with as much passion as she does.</i>
6764014 6765224 <i>But I failed her.</i>
6766141 6767371 <i>Instead of doing what was right...</i>
6768769 6769939 <i>I did what was easy.</i>
6770687 6774317 <i>You talk like a man who believes<br />he can make amends to his wife.</i>

6859109 6862279 <i>I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.</i>
6867201 6869991 Margo Dunne, this is a search<br />warrant for your property.
6870037 6872247 I usually ignore tipline calls...
6872289 6876879 but a neighbor was concerned about a<br />strange man around your woodshed.
6877294 6878254 Call Tanner.
6878295 6879465 Okay. Fuck!
6883592 6885052 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.
6886303 6887343 Is that what this is about?
6888805 6893555 I have treated you more than fair<br />throughout this entire investigation.
6893602 6895902 I gave you the benefit of<br />the doubt, over and over.
6895938 6897438 Every time you said something stupid...
6897481 6899861 I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."
6899900 6902140 But I was wrong. That's what this is about.
6902186 6903606 Are these the clubs you don't play golf with?
6903654 6904454 None of that is mine.
6904947 6906527 None of this was put here by me.
6906573 6910123 Those are nice clubs. You got<br />the makings of a real man cave.
6910160 6913290 Everything just waiting until<br />the wife goes away for good.
6913330 6914410 Nick!
6915666 6918586 - You can't do that!<br />- Of course we can.
6926885 6929465 Amy, it's time to move on.
6929513 6931223 What can I do to help?
6931932 6933482 I need some time to think.
6933517 6936017 - That's the last thing you need.<br />- Desi...
6936061 6938651 Twenty years, you have kept me dangling.
6938689 6942359 Finally, last night, you came<br />to me, and you chose me.
6943068 6944398 Follow that instinct.
6944444 6946864 Don't trust the instinct that<br />left you beaten and homeless...
6947406 6950576 sleeping in your car, fearing for your life.
6953912 6956622 I'm not gonna force myself on you.
6959042 6961712 I understand what you're saying, Desi.
6962963 6964593 I do.
6967926 6969926 I've been so mistreated for so long.
6972598 6975478 I've forgotten how to behave.
6981231 6983531 I'll move in here tomorrow...
6983567 6986147 and we'll work it out together.
6988238 6991948 I just want you to be <i>you</i> again.
6999791 7001291 They only took Margo to fuck with you.
7001335 7003045 She's not spending another<br />fucking second in there.
7003086 7005836 I'm gonna go in, and I'm<br />gonna tell them everything.
7006507 7008257 What?
7010260 7011890 We tell Boney very little.
7011929 7014059 Without a body, without a murder weapon...
7014097 7016387 their only hope is a confession.
7016433 7018393 So, you let them do all the talking.
7018435 7020555 That way, we can jump-start your defense.
7020604 7022984 The truth is my defense.
7028946 7029896 Recognize these?
7029947 7032067 Yes. It's Amy's anniversary present to me.
7032115 7033905 Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick?
7033951 7036451 Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad?
7036954 7038124 No.
7039373 7041123 - Recognize this?<br />- Never seen that before in my life.
7041708 7044958 It's Amy's diary. We found<br />this at your father's house.
7046964 7048264 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7048298 7050298 - He's not a handwriting ex...<br />- Looks like it.
7050342 7051472 Our experts thought so, too.
7052803 7054513 Do you wanna play a little true or false?
7055264 7056474 Sure.
7056515 7060985 "And then he brushes the sugar<br />off my lips so he can taste me."
7062104 7064114 Yeah, that's true.
7065357 7067357 You thought Quinoa was a fish?
7068652 7069992 That is also true, yes.
7072155 7074275 She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her.
7074324 7076334 I hit her? No, never happened.
7076368 7077988 - "Pushed," it says, "pushed."<br />- Absolutely not.
7078036 7079116 I never touched her.
7081540 7083170 She tried to buy a gun.
7083834 7085714 I doubt that, but I don't know.
7087129 7088759 Shall I read the last entry?
7088797 7089837 Sure.
7091133 7093263 "This man may kill me."
7093302 7095512 In her own words, "This man may kill me."
7095554 7097684 It's kind of a convenient end note.
7104188 7105608 For future reference...
7105647 7107977 the truth, you are not a handwriting expert.
7108025 7109075 Okay, I know.
7117492 7119332 Judy's missing handle.
7120871 7123161 Big as a two-by-four, right? Big as a club.
7123207 7125957 We found this day one, in the<br />fireplace, in your home office.
7126001 7128471 We didn't know what the hell<br />it was, but fire in July?
7128512 7129352 We bagged it.
7129388 7130708 Well, I've never seen that before, either.
7130756 7133376 We just tested it. Fire<br />doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7133425 7135635 So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...
7135677 7137297 you're under arrest for the murder of your wife.
7137346 7138556 Do not say another word.
7138597 7139927 - What about my side?<br />- Nick!
7153278 7154738 More coffee?
7154780 7156570 I'd love it.
7158867 7162497 Remember that time we skipped<br />school and drove to the Cape?
7162538 7165078 God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.
7165123 7166753 This reminds me of that.
7167251 7168921 Never-ending holiday.
7170462 7172672 You're not bored?
7172714 7174224 Desi, how could I be bored?
7174258 7176718 You can discuss 18th-century symphonies...
7176760 7179680 19th-century impressionists,<br />quote Proust in French.
7180055 7184175 Nick's idea of culture was<br />a reality TV marathon...
7184226 7186096 with one hand down his boxers.
7188105 7189695 I really have to get going.
7190023 7193363 But I will be back just as soon as I can.
7199950 7201030 My keys.
7206248 7208248 Thank you.
7219469 7221049 That's how the kids wear it.
7281865 7285695 Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.
7288539 7289709 Hey.
7290123 7292503 - Are you okay?<br />- Yes. Are you?
7292543 7293793 Yeah.
7293836 7295706 Let's go.
7297548 7298758 What does this mean?
7298799 7300969 Well, you're out on bond.
7301009 7304219 You can relax at home while we prep for trial.
7309726 7311726 Keep your head down.
7327160 7329540 Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy?
7329580 7331580 I've got two of my best guys on it.
7332082 7333712 She's air.
7335752 7338712 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7395938 7398478 Mr. Collings is home.
7398524 7400904 Hello, Mr. Collings.
7400943 7402823 I've missed you.
7402861 7404491 I've been thinking...
7404947 7407117 I don't wanna be without you.
7407824 7410164 Stay with me.
7410202 7413162 And when all this dies down, we'll<br />go to Greece, like you said.
7413205 7415505 Octopus and Scrabble?
7417501 7419751 How long do you think until it's done?
7419795 7423385 Not long. Six months for the trial.<br />Sentencing will be quick.
7423882 7424972 He'll appeal.
7425008 7427138 I can watch the rest overseas.
7444528 7445818 Go slowly.
7445863 7446743 But I want it.
7467217 7468797 Don't rush.
7468844 7470934 Just do it.
7479396 7480936 Harder.
7579496 7582666 You fucking bitch.
7591341 7595011 <i>Don't you worry, you're<br />gonna have lots of babies.</i>
7596638 7600138 Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br />There was semen present.
7600184 7601314 We'll make sure it's a match.
7601351 7603101 Yeah, it'll match.
7603145 7605615 Thank you very much.
7605647 7607147 What do you think?
7607191 7608481 Are we pals again?
7608525 7612065 Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes.
7612112 7613072 What do you think?
7613113 7616033 Kidnapping? The story's insane.
7618202 7620662 She's on fairly heavy painkillers.
7620704 7622624 It's okay. I want to help.
7622664 7624084 Ms. Dunne, I know what you've been through...
7624124 7626464 so we'll keep this very brief.
7626502 7628882 Can you walk us through what happened?
7631507 7634127 That morning, the doorbell rang.
7635010 7637010 So normal.
7637054 7638894 I opened the door.
7639515 7641355 So strange.
7641975 7645595 Since high school, he won't ever go away.
7645646 7648726 And I've just tried to be nice to him.
7648774 7650404 Answer his letters.
7650651 7652651 Keep him calm.
7654071 7655531 Oh, my God.
7656156 7657776 I've encouraged him.
7657824 7659624 You can't blame yourself.
7661245 7663415 He pushed inside.
7664998 7667038 And he grabbed me.
7667751 7670841 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.
7671171 7672881 And he clubbed me.
7673340 7674760 I collapsed.
7674800 7678850 That club was actually the handle<br />to a Punch and Judy puppet.
7678887 7680307 Right.
7681223 7682643 Treasure hunt.
7684560 7686600 I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...
7686645 7688365 Then how did Desi have that handle?
7690232 7692152 I'd just found it.
7692901 7695321 It must have fallen off.
7697239 7700909 I was holding it when Desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7700951 7702161 About that woodshed...
7702202 7703872 He took me to his lake house.
7704454 7706164 Tied me to his bed.
7706206 7708746 Back to the woodshed real quick. Real quick.
7708792 7710632 When you went to place the puppets there...
7710669 7712049 did you notice that it was packed...
7712087 7713247 Lots of stuff.
7713297 7717717 Corresponding to purchases made on<br />credit cards, in your husband's name.
7717759 7719259 Nick and credit cards.
7719303 7721853 He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.
7721889 7724679 He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.<br />They're very close.
7725225 7729555 Now, may I go back to where I<br />was being held prisoner...
7729605 7732365 by a man with a history of mental problems?
7732399 7733269 Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
7737779 7739859 Desi assaulted me that night.
7740824 7742664 Every night.
7743785 7746195 He tied me up like a dog.
7747581 7750081 And then, he'd punish me.
7752002 7754052 Starve me.
7755339 7757259 Shave me.
7758884 7760844 Sodomize me.
7761637 7763467 There were cameras everywhere.
7763514 7766474 Please find this. Please find the tapes.
7768143 7771353 She slit his throat with a box cutter.
7772439 7774649 How did she manage to get<br />a hold of a box cutter...
7774691 7777281 if he had her tied up the whole time?
7778237 7780277 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7781073 7783033 Amy, we found your diary.
7783075 7787165 It contains many concerning allegations<br />of mental and physical abuse.
7787204 7790084 Well, it's the ugly truth.
7790916 7792416 Nick didn't want a baby.
7794253 7797553 He has a temper. We had money problems.
7798465 7799585 But I love him.
7799633 7801383 Then why did you try to buy a gun?
7803345 7805425 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7805472 7807312 If I could just clarify one thing...
7807349 7810559 If this case had been left in<br />your deeply incompetent hands...
7810602 7812482 my husband would be on death row...
7812771 7816521 and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...
7816817 7820487 Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.<br />We're finished.
7821363 7823533 Now, I have to ask you...
7823574 7826414 Do you feel safe going home with your husband?
7838839 7841469 We prayed to God, and God<br />has answered our prayers.
7841508 7842878 Amy Dunne is home.
7842926 7845006 Now, I know there are a lot<br />of questions and concerns...
7845053 7847063 but for right now, we wanna sit tight...
7847097 7852017 and just be thankful and grateful for<br />this <i>miracle</i> on the Mississippi.
7859484 7861284 Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.
7913038 7914248 We love you, Amy!
7918877 7920707 Alright, you can stop pretending now.
7920754 7922424 I'm not pretending.
7923131 7924841 You were perfect.
7925467 7928007 The Nick I saw on TV, that's<br />the Nick I fell in love with.
7928053 7930763 You do know I was just telling you<br />what you wanted to hear, right?
7930806 7932636 That's how well you know me.
7932683 7935313 You know me in your marrow.
7936311 7937901 Okay.
7937938 7941268 You need to tell me exactly what happened.
7942568 7943818 Take off your clothes.
7944319 7947529 I need to make sure you're not wearing a wire.
7960836 7964836 You killed someone, Amy. You're a murderer.
7964882 7966472 I'm a fighter.
7966508 7968968 I fought my way back to you.
7969011 7970851 You killed a guy.
7970888 7972848 You slashed his throat with a box cutter.
7972890 7977560 You went on national television and<br />begged for me to save your life.
7978145 7979405 And I obliged.
7979438 7980898 But I want that Nick.
7981231 7982651 I'm leaving.
7982691 7985321 You really think that's smart?
7985986 7986946 Shampoo?
7989698 7993618 Wounded, raped wife battles her<br />way back to her husband...
7993660 7995540 and he deserts her.
7995579 7996619 They'll destroy you.
7997372 7998872 Neighbors will shun you.
7998916 8003126 And I'll make sure that no one<br />forgets the pain you caused me.
8005214 8010304 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8010886 8012506 Once they go...
8013388 8014308 I go.
8014348 8017768 Give it the night. Sleep on it.
8034618 8036198 Was there ever a baby?
8036495 8038585 There can be.
8042584 8043594 Good night.
8096513 8098183 Hey, Nick!
8110319 8111569 Hello, handsome.
8114698 8116448 Crepe?
8117159 8118079 Sure.
8118118 8119828 <i>She was his dream girl.</i>
8119870 8123290 <i>And when this spoiled, rich, entitled<br />little boy couldn't have her...</i>
8123332 8124712 <i>he took her.</i>
8132090 8133430 You must be so proud.
8140682 8142682 It's been four hours.
8143185 8146025 Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?
8150192 8153032 Right now, it's all about our marriage.
8153862 8157372 When two people love each other<br />and can't make that work...
8157407 8159827 that's the real tragedy.
8163580 8165620 Kiss my cheek.
8171964 8174764 I can't believe that fucking<br />spider is America's sweetheart.
8174800 8177010 She told me she killed Desi.
8177052 8178392 Not self-defense. Murder.
8178428 8179968 - Can't we get a wire?<br />- That's not gonna work.
8180013 8181183 She told you once before.
8181223 8183563 Yeah, because she had me strip<br />naked, and stand in the shower.
8183600 8186850 I swear, you two are the most<br />fucked-up people I've ever known.
8186895 8188355 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8188605 8190435 You and Amy, under the same roof?
8190482 8192282 You should pitch that as reality television.
8192901 8195281 Amy Dunne, and the miracle on the Mississippi.
8195320 8197820 <i>Nick and I have been through some bad patches.</i>
8197865 8199205 <i>We've had our dark days.</i>
8199241 8201081 <i>But we thank you so much...</i>
8201577 8206117 <i>for supporting us in our new life<br />together, for forgiving Nick.</i>
8206373 8210093 <i>Really, your encouragement means the world.</i>
8210127 8211537 Oh, she is good.
8211587 8214167 Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.
8214214 8216304 The real housewives of Branson.
8216341 8217431 Take care of this guy, will you?
8217467 8218837 I can't believe you're just leaving now.
8219094 8220644 You are not at risk anymore.
8220679 8222219 I'm the definition of, "at risk."
8222264 8226394 You got a book deal, a lifetime<br />movie, you franchised the bar.
8226435 8227485 You may wanna thank her.
8230522 8231942 Just don't piss her off.
8232774 8233534 See you, guys.
8235903 8237573 Elvis has left Missouri.
8237613 8238703 She had to have made a mistake.
8238739 8241029 We need to check Amy's story, piece by piece.
8241074 8242954 Nick, I can't do anything.
8243368 8246198 We had the national spotlight<br />on us, we stained the rug.
8246246 8247956 The case is with the feds now, they're done.
8247998 8249138 That doesn't mean you have to be done.
8249458 8251248 It does.
8282824 8284284 What are you doing?
8286203 8287793 Couldn't sleep.
8287829 8288499 Come on...
8289122 8291292 let me tuck you back in.
8303971 8306601 You know you can sleep with me, right?
8308684 8310774 Yeah, it's just...
8310811 8312311 I need more time.
8312354 8315904 I would never, ever hurt you.
8317693 8320153 I do need you to participate, though.
8320195 8322355 I need you to do your part.
8332666 8333416 Okay.
8334418 8337248 Everything you have heard about my wife...
8337296 8338666 is a lie.
8338714 8342804 She is a calculating, murderous psychopath.
8343427 8344967 And I have been complicit...
8345012 8346142 Nick!
8351810 8353980 Nick? Breakfast.
8354021 8354851 Honey?
8358567 8361027 We should hold hands.
8361069 8364159 Not the entire time, but on and off, throughout.
8365574 8367784 "So, Nick, how does it feel<br />to have your wife back?"
8370412 8372292 "It's fantastic.
8372331 8375381 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8375417 8377127 "Fantastic" is a little flippant.
8377544 8378674 "Amazing"?
8378712 8381552 I need you to admit that you<br />got the credit cards...
8381590 8384590 and that you hid all that stuff<br />at Go's and that you pushed me.
8385344 8388394 I'm gonna need those three things, to feel safe.
8389598 8391428 You have to own this, Nick.
8392226 8395766 Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.
8397356 8399106 Nick.
8402069 8404699 What a beautiful home.
8405948 8408618 I so appreciate you giving us this time, Nick.
8408659 8410829 You went on national television...
8410869 8413129 and told people that I murdered my wife.
8413172 8414422 Well, I go where the story goes.
8414665 8417635 You implied that I had carnal<br />relations with my sister.
8417668 8421208 I didn't use the "I" word. I said<br />you two were, "extremely close."
8421255 8425935 You, and a panel of nitwits,<br />diagnosed me, as a sociopath.
8427135 8428885 Ice-breaker.
8432599 8434389 To go with your robot dog.
8434434 8436484 I'll go find Amy.
8438522 8440612 She's downstairs.
8443110 8444740 - What is it?<br />- It's for you.
8444778 8446198 Open it.
8446488 8448238 I don't need any more gifts from you.
8448282 8449992 Open it.
8462546 8464206 I didn't touch you.
8464256 8465296 You didn't need to.
8465340 8468550 Bullshit. That notice of disposal.
8468594 8470104 I have that. You threw it out.
8470137 8471967 The notice, yes.
8472347 8473217 I want a blood test.
8473765 8474845 I want a paternity test.
8475642 8476482 I love tests.
8476519 8478849 Amy, you can teach those people<br />to hate me all you want.
8478896 8481606 I don't care. I am leaving you.
8483734 8486444 I won't have to teach your child to hate you.
8486486 8488856 He'll do that all by himself.
8488906 8490776 You fucking cunt!
8492659 8495039 I'm the cunt you married.
8495078 8496868 The only time you liked yourself...
8496914 8500584 was when you were trying to be<br />someone this cunt might like.
8500626 8504086 I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.
8507841 8511091 I've killed for you. Who else can say that?
8512346 8514886 You think you would be happy<br />with a nice midwestern girl?
8514932 8517772 No way, baby. I'm it.
8517809 8521229 Look, you're delusional. You're insane.
8521271 8522771 Why would you even want this?
8523148 8524228 Yes, I loved you.
8524274 8527744 And then all we did was resent each<br />other, and try to control each other.
8527778 8528778 And cause each other pain.
8529321 8531111 That's marriage.
8533784 8536164 Now, I'm getting ready.
8561478 8564558 I can't watch you play house with<br />that thing for the next 18 years.
8564606 8566266 I can't just walk away.
8566316 8567896 You could get custody.
8567943 8571823 No, I won't. And you know it.
8571864 8574374 It's gonna be my child. I'm not gonna leave it.
8574992 8576792 You wanna stay.
8576827 8580747 I have a responsibility. It's<br />not about what I want anymore.
8580789 8582039 You wanna stay with her.
8592676 8593716 You're breaking my heart.
8594178 8597808 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8597848 8600348 I need you with me on this.
8600392 8602852 Of course I'm with you.
8605480 8609480 I was with you before we were even born.
8611236 8614026 <i>We've been through the darkness.</i>
8614573 8617873 We've come out, united.
8620871 8623041 We communicate.
8625334 8627844 We're honest with each other.
8627878 8629378 Right?
8631298 8633798 We're partners in crime.
8637179 8638009 And?
8639890 8641220 And?
8644728 8646648 We're gonna be parents.
8646857 8649077 Oh, my goodness!
8650400 8652360 - Oh, how exciting, oh!<br />- Thank you.
8657157 8659527 <i>"What are you thinking?"</i>
8662371 8664581 <i>"How are you feeling?"</i>
8666542 8669172 <i>"What have we done to each other?"</i>
8670754 8672844 <i>"What will we do?"</i>
