9760 11888 DAVID FINCHER: So, one of the things<br />during the, uh, editing
11971 14182 that we became profoundly aware of
14473 19562 is the need for Regency Pictures to<br />get a new logo.
23774 24775 NICK: When I think of my wife...
27195 29697 ...I always think of her head.
29822 33826 FINCHER: This shot was problematic<br />because we had these long wigs
34118 38956 for, um, Amy, as she is meant to be adored.
39248 41292 And they were just...
41375 45129 I think almost every single shot<br />of her in this movie
45213 49383 has been re-touched along the wig line<br />in order to fix it.
49508 54472 Wig technology has not really changed<br />since Shakespeare
54639 59018 and no new procedures or techniques
59101 61938 were designed or founded on this film
62021 64690 to make them any better<br />than they've ever been.
65274 67151 Thank God for digital re-touching.
71072 76160 We shot the movie in a small town<br />south of St. Louis by about two hours.
76285 80498 Location scouts went out for<br />about three weeks to find a small town
80581 82750 that could double<br />for North Carthage, Missouri,
82833 87505 which is a fabricated town<br />that Gillian created in her head.
87964 92510 And we had people combing from<br />the actual town of Carthage, Missouri,
92635 97181 through Springfield and up<br />along the Mississippi into St. Louis.
97265 101852 And one day I got these pictures<br />of Cape Girardeau,
102186 105982 and I, um, sent them immediately to Gillian<br />and said,
106190 109777 I think we found the town.<br />I think we've found North Carthage.
109860 112905 "And I think it's gonna be<br />this town called Cape Girardeau.”
112989 114824 And she said, "Oh, God,<br />Cape Girardeau's perfect.
114907 118035 "That's kind of what I had in my head<br />when I was writing it."
119078 124125 And I was like, "You don't have<br />to keep this a fucking secret.
124208 128212 "If you have ideas about<br />where these things should take place...
128296 131007 "If you wanna hip us to<br />what you had in your head
131090 134885 "when you were actually writing it,<br />by all means, feel free to."
138973 139974 (SIGHS)
140808 142643 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
144312 146981 So, Carrie Coon. Carrie Coon was...
147064 150735 In trying to, kind of, build a relationship<br />between two people
150818 153321 who were supposed to have,<br />at one point, shared a womb,
153404 155448 you really wanna find...
155656 157575 The actor who's gonna play Margo
157658 164415 has to really be able to sort of think<br />and verbalize and finish sentences
164498 166584 at the same speed that Ben Affleck does,
166667 168461 and that wasn't<br />the easiest thing in the world.
168544 170880 And we were incredibly fortunate
170963 175051 when Carrie Coon dropped out of the sky<br />into our laps.
175634 176886 I saw an audition
176969 180806 that she had done with her brother<br />on an iPad and sent.
180890 186479 And I think it was like 15 or 18 pages<br />of material that she had and she read,
186562 190191 and it was kind of like, "Wow, who is this?"
190733 193736 So I sent it to Ben,<br />and he looked at it and said,
193819 196364 "She doesn't look anything like me.<br />She's perfect.”" (CHUCKLES)
196906 198407 -Made it kind of interesting.<br />-It's great.
199116 202870 FINCHER: I hadn't originally thought of Ben<br />for this role
202953 205706 because I actually knew<br />that he was crewing up
205873 207792 for his Dennis Lehane film that<br />he was making at Warner Brothers,
209794 213297 and we were talking to<br />a lot of the same crew members,
213381 215591 and so as they were hiring, we were hiring.
215674 217551 And then suddenly someone told me,
217635 221555 "Well, he might be amenable to being<br />in Gone Girl if you move quickly enough.”
221639 225059 So, I met with him, I think it was like<br />on a Thursday night,
225142 230189 and by the weekend we were frying to<br />figure out a way to push back his life
230272 233984 and move it out of the way<br />of my new priorities.
234235 235820 It might attract some desperate characters.
235903 238614 FINCHER: I really liked<br />the dialogue in this scene.
238697 243244 I really liked this notion<br />of this studied effervescence
243327 245830 or studied witticisms.
245913 249166 And the notion of this idealized pick-up.
249375 254505 When I read the script, I thought it was<br />very funny in that it was self-conscious
254588 257091 and yet it's two people<br />sort of testing each other.
257174 259260 And what you don't take into account,
259343 262221 obviously, when you read a script<br />like this for the first time,
262388 265558 is how many impressions... (CHUCKLES)
265641 269061 ...the marketing is going to<br />have to make on the audience
269145 273441 <i>in order to deliver them into the cinema<br />to watch these two characters meet.</i>
273524 278028 And the weirdest phenomenon is that
278154 280865 we have the issue<br />of the unreliable narrator.
280948 285995 We have the issue of, "This is Amy's<br />memory, supposedly, of this moment,
286078 288789 “or her fictionalized memory<br />of this moment,
288873 293210 "and that has to be stylized<br />from that subjective standpoint.”
293294 298215 But on top of it, we needed fo,<br />in the marketing,
298340 300050 let people know what the stakes were.
300134 304346 And so we had this shot designed,<br />always, of Amy underwater,
304430 308225 her body being dropped and floating down<br />to the bottom of the Mississippi.
308434 310644 And you don't realize
310728 316650 how that's going to affect the audience's<br />embracing of a meet-cute.
316734 319320 And when we first started<br />screening the movie,
319403 322406 nobody in the audience had ever seen<br />any of the marketing materials,
322490 325326 and so they really<br />enjoyed the first meeting.
325409 328162 And then by the time we got to<br />the second screening of the movie,
328245 329830 the teaser and the trailer had been out.
329914 333834 And so now, all of a sudden,<br />the audience was very resistant
333918 336754 to the idea of liking<br />either of these characters
336837 340799 because they thought,<br />"Well, the blond chick might die.
341175 342635 “I don't know that I want to like her,
342718 345137 “and I certainly don't<br />want to like her husband.”
345262 351560 (CHUCKLES) So, it's a tricky, sort of,<br />postmodern hurdle to jump.
351644 353354 You have to market a movie in a way
353437 355147 that's going to bring people<br />into the theaters.
355314 357858 Sometimes you have<br />to promise them things
357942 362029 that are beyond the opening scenes<br />of the narrative.
362112 365407 And when you do that, you kind of fuck up.
365950 370246 Um, their minds aren't blank slates
370329 372915 when they come into the theater.
372998 377878 This is the only time I've ever shot<br />on the back lot at Universal.
377962 382383 And it was only because it ended up<br />being much less of a nightmare
382466 384218 than trying to shoot in Brooklyn.
384885 389348 I love the idea of<br />romance amongst garbage.
389431 392393 This reminds me of the<br />Sid and Nancy poster.
392476 395646 They're kissing and the garbage cans<br />and paper towels
395729 398649 and stuff's being strewn<br />and flying through the air behind them.
401485 404738 There was a lot of talk about likeability,
404822 408867 which you can imagine is something<br />that is of preeminent importance to me.
408951 411537 But there was a big conversation<br />about whether or not
411620 415374 Ben's character, Nick,<br />would be likeable enough.
415457 417668 And I remember when we were<br />working out their first sex scene,
419169 422047 when he takes Amy back to his apartment,
422256 424133 and it was originally supposed to be
424216 427094 this unbelievable missionary-position sex
427177 430723 that resulted in cooperative orgasms.
430806 432850 And we started, kind of, rehearsing that.
432933 435185 And it just, sort of, took forever.
435519 437605 I thought, maybe if we<br />tracked from the window
437688 441275 so that we could hear a garbage truck<br />moving around or something,
441358 443110 and then we saw him on top of her
443193 446238 and maybe he is performing oral sex on her.
446322 448824 And I broached this and Rosamund said,
448907 450868 "Oh, I think Amy would<br />like that very much.” (LAUGHING)
451243 453287 And Ben was like, "Okay, I'm game."
453370 456373 And I sent the dailies to Gillian Flynn<br />and said,
456457 459585 "So, what do you think?"<br />"Cause we'd never discussed it.
459793 462129 And she wrote me back saying,
462212 466592 "I don't think he has any more likeability<br />issues, at least as it relates to women."
468636 469637 Ugh, that's symbolic.
469720 470679 Yeah.
470763 472097 What's the gift for five?
472181 473182 Wood.
473682 477144 FINCHER: (CHUCKLING) This is something<br />that Ben is extraordinarily good at.
477227 480731 When he has to<br />cook up a phone conversation,
480814 483275 when he has to hear somebody<br />on the other end of a phone,
483359 485277 it's kind of stunning how...
485903 489698 If I was his wife, I think I would be<br />very suspicious always
489782 491450 of whoever just called,
491575 497581 because he has a real gift at being able<br />to insinuate a conversation.
500250 503754 So it's one thing to find a town<br />that you can say,
503837 506882 "This is the non-existent North Carthage,”
507007 511303 but then to find the house<br />and the neighborhoods within that town.
511387 513806 We had to find the Dunne house.
513889 517935 And we found this house on a beautiful
518519 522523 tree-lined neighborhood<br />that had one road in
522606 525150 and had this great vantage<br />looking down the street,
525234 529071 So you could see all the cars, as they came<br />up the hill and pulled into the driveway.
529154 531865 And we found this beautiful house,<br />and we talked to the family,
531949 534702 and we encouraged them and cajoled them
534785 536912 and did everything we could<br />to get them to say yes
536995 538664 to use the exterior of their house.
538747 543711 And kind of realized about<br />halfway through the negotiations
543794 545879 to shoot the exteriors of this house,
545963 551135 that the interior of the house that<br />we had designed was a lot larger.
552636 556515 And by that I mean<br />probably 6 feet in every direction.
556598 561854 The footprint of the house was a couple<br />thousand square feet bigger all in
561937 564732 once you took in this increase<br />in the footprint.
564815 569653 And it was one of those moments where<br />you have to kind of ask yourself,
569945 572030 “Is this important
572114 576910 “that the interior reflect<br />exactly what the exterior reflects?”
576994 581373 And Don Burt, the production designer,<br />we started talking about this.
581457 583917 Like, where were we gonna cut,<br />what were we gonna cut back on
584001 586670 in order to make the interior of the house
587004 589590 conform to the actual footprint<br />of the real house?
589673 592760 And we kind of got the idea that maybe,<br />ultimately, it didn't matter.
592843 594553 That what we were talking about
594636 599266 was a relationship that had two people<br />who had become estranged,
599349 602644 and that maybe it was a good thing<br />to have a lot of real estate,
602728 605773 So that you really look at it and you<br />become very aware of the fact
605856 609067 that these are two people<br />who don't have any kids.
609151 611487 He has his own office,<br />she has her own office.
611695 613113 They have a room for the cat box.
613238 616408 There's a lot of space here<br />that's sort of vacant.
616492 618327 And there's vacancies in their lives.
618410 620788 And so it was an interesting look into
621038 626960 how rigorous and accurate<br />one has to be in telling a story
627211 631089 because I don't think<br />we probably could have fit
631298 635052 half the rooms in the actual downstairs
635135 637513 in the real house<br />that we used for the exterior.
639264 641683 So, Kim Dickens is an actor
641767 645604 that I had seen a million times.
645687 648565 And I kind of never put it together<br />it was the same person.
648899 650818 I had seen her in Deadwood,<br />I had seen her in Treme,
650901 654071 I had seen her in,<br />I guess it was Hollow Man.
654154 658742 And she has a very interesting energy.
659076 662204 But she also is really chameleon-like
662287 664957 in terms of what you get from her.
665415 668794 And her audition just wowed us all.
668877 671088 We were kind of like, "She's perfect.”
671338 673632 Patrick Fugit was somebody<br />that I'd known...
673715 675759 I'd heard about from Cameron Crowe.
675968 680138 And I had seen him, obviously,<br />in Almost Famous,
680222 683600 and I had seen him in<br />a couple of other things since then.
683725 685978 But when he came in, I was like...
686395 690566 I mean, we did not want our local cops<br />to be rubes.
690649 692568 We wanted them to be legitimate.
693110 696280 We're not making fun of law enforcement<br />or jurisprudence.
696363 698365 We wanted it to be, uh...
698448 701201 I mean, we're definitely going to be<br />taking the piss out of the media soon,
701285 705247 or certainly that of ambulance-chasing<br />tragedy vampires.
705372 708625 But I wanted to make sure that<br />our police force was...
709376 710627 There's no Barney Fifes.
710919 712921 Your wife is Amazing Amy?
713505 715716 Yeah. She is.
715883 717509 Wow.
719511 722556 FINCHER: So, the device of the diaries,
722639 727311 the subjectivity of Amy Dunne's<br />view of her marriage.
727394 730981 She has to speak to you, possibly,<br />from beyond the grave.
731064 734651 She has to whisper in your ear and tell you<br />what was going on in her marriage.
734735 738405 And I was daunted when I read the book
738488 743160 that a satisfactory device could be found<br />that would be cinematic.
743327 746580 And I opened the first draft of the script<br />and I started reading
746663 749416 and this idea of seeing<br />these manicured hands
749499 752002 and beautiful handwriting
752085 756340 as she lets you in on her deepest,<br />most intimate thoughts,
756590 758175 it was so straightforward.
758258 761303 And the way that she<br />connected the time frames,
761386 763513 where we are in their marriage
763597 767601 and where we are in her disappointment,
767684 770562 the fact that it was, kind of, signposted
770646 774650 by these different pens<br />that we see in her hand.
774733 778320 It was such a beautiful, simple, fun idea.
778403 781323 And then we see them later being<br />tossed out the window of the car
781406 784743 and that they sort of mark<br />the evolution of her vitriol.
784826 786536 I know I can't complain.
786703 789206 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
789373 791667 No, they improved upon it...
791750 794628 FINCHER: So, there's a process that<br />happens after you've kind of said,
794711 796213 "All right, this is the movie that<br />we're gonna make,"
796296 799967 where you try to codify what you need
800050 803470 from each of the performers<br />who's going to play the characters.
803553 806598 And I remember in conversations
806682 809059 that we were having about<br />who would play Amy,
809226 811436 Rosamund Pike's name came up.
811520 814481 And I always thought she was stunning.
814564 817776 I always thought that she was a really<br />interesting presence.
817943 819653 But when [ started to...
819736 823657 You kind of go through your checklist<br />of what do I need to avoid here?
823740 826284 What are the pitfalls?
826368 829162 Either her other roles that she's been in
829246 832708 or performance tics or habits that she has.
832791 834501 What works against me?
834584 838922 'Cause I kind of had this idea that<br />I really wanted Carolyn Bessette.
839256 841675 That was kind of my vision of Amy
841758 845178 or the person that kind of<br />kept lodging in my thinking.
845345 847014 So when Rosamund's name came up,
847097 850976 obviously she was statuesque,<br />she was stunning to look at,
851059 855272 she had all of that, sort of...<br />The arm piece, the prize.
855355 858692 She had all of those things<br />already, physically.
858775 861361 And I had seen three or four movies<br />that she'd been in
861445 863363 over the course of<br />probably six or eight years.
863447 866283 And I kept sort of hitting my head<br />against the wall
866366 871538 in trying to figure out what was<br />my impression of her from those movies?
871621 874416 And I realized I didn't have one.
874499 876126 I had an idea of what she looked like.
876209 878128 I had an idea of<br />how that could be interpreted,
878211 880505 how her physical presence<br />could be interpreted.
880589 884342 But I didn't really have a sense of<br />who she was as a human,
884426 885969 or a sense of who she was as an actor.
886136 887679 And that's a weird thing.
887763 890682 When you spend your whole life<br />watching actors on TV,
890766 892642 which is basically what directors do,
892726 896730 you form, or you learn to form,<br />very quick opinions
896813 898565 and I had none.
898648 901318 And I started to think that maybe that was
901735 904863 kind of a great and important<br />aspect of Amy.
904946 909326 That Amy had to be so many different<br />things to so many different people
909409 912496 that, in a weird way,<br />the impression that she makes
912621 916166 should be, sort of, unfathomable.
916333 917417 And then I met with her.
917501 921713 And told her how horrendous and difficult
921797 924716 and uncomfortable this movie would be.<br />(CHUCKLING)
924841 926676 And she didn't seem dissuaded.
926760 929096 And in the course of a...
929179 931556 I think we had a five or six-hour dinner.
932057 935727 In the course of this dinner<br />I asked her about how she grew up.
935811 937896 And I wanted to know about her siblings.
937979 939856 And she told me she was an only child.
939940 943819 And it suddenly occurred to me that<br />that was the thing
943902 946655 that whoever played Amy had to have,
946738 950242 is that sort of socialization amongst adults.
950325 952994 It's just a different kind of...
953078 954955 People just behave differently.
955038 957457 And so it was kind of the a-ha moment.
957541 959876 And then the question is, "Okay.
960627 965132 "Are you willing to gain and lose<br />12 to 15 pounds
965215 967759 “every month for four months?
967843 972681 "Are you willing to be naked and<br />covered in blood for weeks at a time?
972764 976810 "And are you willing to do all<br />of the really heinous things
976893 979729 “that this character is going to ask of you?"
979896 981231 And she was all for it.
981773 983275 She's a voracious reader.
983441 986278 So, she's always got a book in her hand.
987362 988697 Well, days can get long.
988864 992576 I know a few housewives, that evening<br />glass of wine starts coming at noon.
992742 993910 Or prescription pills.
994077 995453 GILPIN: Just last week,<br />we had a soccer mom.
995912 997998 FINCHER: We shot the North Carthage<br />Police Department
998081 1002335 at a building in Culver City<br />where we'd shot a lot of Zodiac.
1002419 1005922 And it was a...<br />It's just a great mid-century building
1006256 1009342 that has a courthouse in it and a jail.
1009426 1013054 <i>We didn't get to use the jail.<br />We used the jail in Cape Girardeau.</i>
1013930 1016474 But it's one of those things where<br />you come back and you go,
1016558 1020353 "Oh, my God, we're in this police<br />department again for another 10 days."
1021771 1022731 We'll look into that.
1022814 1025317 You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.
1025483 1026860 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that out.
1026943 1027944 Well, I was home.
1028111 1030614 I left at 9:30,<br />I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.
1030780 1032282 I went to Sawyer Beach and read the news.
1033116 1035202 FINCHER: There's a moment in here<br />that I really love.
1035660 1037537 It's such a lovely, little thing
1037621 1039497 that happens in the middle<br />of Boney's gear change.
1039581 1042959 She puts A and B together, and then<br />asks the question about blood type.
1043084 1047005 His confusion or his momentary,<br />sort of, pit stop
1047088 1050634 as he weighs, "What is the<br />relative importance to this?"
1050800 1051885 Type A?
1051968 1054429 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1054596 1057307 You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.
1059059 1063146 FINCHER: That's just one of those things<br />that, you know, actors give you.
1063230 1066483 It's mortar that holds these ideas together
1066566 1069402 and binds the characters.
1069653 1070612 Uh... Maybe it's type O.
1070695 1072781 -Where are her folks? New York?<br />-Yeah.
1072948 1074574 Can they get here time<br />for this press conference tomorrow?
1074699 1076618 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1076785 1078495 You haven't called your wife's parents yet?
1078662 1081122 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1081206 1083541 Call them, please, Nick. Now.
1083625 1084834 Fine.
1087337 1088797 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
1090340 1092259 Should I know my wife's blood type?
1092342 1093343 (WHISPERING) No.
1093677 1097347 I apologize, Marybeth.<br />I didn't know what was going on.
1097514 1098890 Now I'm at the station...
1099057 1101101 FINCHER: There's a moment at<br />the beginning of this shot
1101184 1102269 as Boney comes forward
1102352 1107315 where you can see Patrick Fugit<br />Just existing through the glass walls,
1107399 1110527 through the aluminum sash windows<br />in the background.
1110610 1111945 And he is in character.
1112028 1116449 And he's being thoughtful,<br />but he's completely alone in the scene.
1116533 1118618 And I love those things where you just get
1118702 1122330 a little, tiny, single-digit percentage<br />point of a characterization
1122414 1125542 Just on the edge of frame as you move on<br />to this other idea.
1125709 1129296 Leonard, who plays Ben's father,<br />came up with this idea
1129379 1131631 that he really wanted to be<br />scratching his arm all the time.
1131715 1133883 And I was like, "Okay." (CHUCKLING)
1134050 1138346 And that's another thing. You just see<br />little behavioral moments in the wide shots
1138430 1142642 Just past other important bits<br />of dialogue that are going on.
1142726 1148315 But I like these little moments where<br />an actor sort of invests in this notion
1148398 1150108 and then does their little thing
1150191 1152819 even though<br />that's not what the scene's about.
1152902 1155739 It's just happening tangentially.
1155822 1159284 The tangential is always,<br />it's so much more important to behavior
1159367 1161911 almost than the intentional.
1164331 1166166 This was something Leonard came up with.
1166291 1168585 (LAUGHING) He just, on one take...
1168710 1172047 It says in the script<br />it's the fastest drop-off ever.
1172130 1174507 And he really does not<br />like being around his father.
1174591 1177177 And Leonard just chimed in with this,
1177260 1179220 "Get your fucking hands off me."
1179304 1181139 And as soon as we cut,<br />everybody cracked up.
1181222 1182682 And I was like, "That one's in the movie."”
1182766 1184934 Get your fucking hands off me.
1185852 1190273 FINCHER: The use of Blue Oyster Cult's<br />Don't Fear the Reaper was not...
1190440 1191649 It's not meaningful.
1191733 1194569 I was riding in a production van
1194652 1196571 <i>from base camp<br />to one of the places we were shooting,</i>
1197947 1202494 and I was just amazed at how much<br />classic rock is played in Missouri.
1203495 1205955 AMY: Marriage is hard work.
1206122 1209042 And compromise and more work.
1209209 1211336 "Abandon all hope, ye who enter.”
1211503 1214297 "When young Amy's hope did wane...
1214464 1215673 "she wandered here..."
1215965 1218259 FINCHER: I think one of the things<br />that becomes
1218343 1221054 apparent about Gillian through her writing
1221137 1226142 is that bourbon and sex<br />are very, very big topics with her.
1226309 1230980 <i>I love the idea of watching somebody's<br />marriage, sort of, fall apart</i>
1231106 1234150 in what they do every year<br />for their anniversary.
1234692 1238071 And I thought that the gimmick<br />of the treasure hunt
1238154 1239823 as this thing that they always do,
1239906 1243493 and how it grows from being something<br />that he likes to be a part of
1243576 1246287 to something he's dreading<br />even knowing about.
1249374 1251084 God bless Jane Austen.
1257966 1260343 FINCHER: Jeff Cronenweth,<br />the director of photography,
1260593 1264347 came into this location we shot<br />in Chinatown in downtown LA.
1264431 1267434 And this was a mahjong parlor<br />or something.
1267517 1269936 I think it had been a restaurant<br />at one point,
1270019 1272105 SO we sort of restored it<br />back to a restaurant.
1272188 1276234 And there were these beautiful fluorescent<br />fixtures from the 1940s
1276317 1278153 that were over this eating area.
1278403 1282699 And, uh, Jeff decided that he wanted to<br />diffuse the light on the side,
1282782 1285994 So he taped up newspapers to the sides
1286077 1289789 so that you had light from the fluorescent<br />through this newsprint,
1289873 1293293 and color advertising and comics pages,
1293376 1296629 and it was really beautiful.<br />It was a great trick.
1296754 1299549 We're so cute.<br />I wanna punch us in the face.
1300258 1302218 FINCHER: So this is one of those things<br />that's tricky is,
1303261 1304179 you have this underlying story
1304262 1308558 that Nick Dunne is trying to be in<br />communication with his girlfriend,
1308683 1309642 (FINCHER LAUGHING)
1309726 1310894 His mistress.
1310977 1312729 And so we had these areas
1312812 1314647 where we had to kind of plant the seeds
1314731 1316649 that would later, hopefully,<br />make people go,
1316733 1318067 "Oh, that's what he was up to."
1318151 1321988 But he had to do these things in the<br />foreground where he takes out his phone,
1322071 1325158 and he looks at it and he puts it away,<br />SO his sister doesn't see it.
1325241 1327785 There are people who do that<br />and it's too pointed.
1327869 1330914 But Ben is very, very subtle.
1331372 1337420 And there's a kind of indirectness<br />to the way that he can do those things,
1338254 1340048 probably because he's so duplicitous.
1340131 1341174 I don't like to be around Amy
1341257 1342509 doesn't mean I don't care about her.
1345595 1347764 Anyway, whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.
1351559 1354521 FINCHER: This scene marks the introduction<br />of the very fabulous
1354604 1356773 and fabulously talented Casey Wilson,
1356856 1360485 who gave us her time<br />and her writing abilities,
1360568 1364531 because a lot of what the character<br />of Noelle, um, has to do
1364614 1367367 exists in these silent flashbacks
1367450 1372789 where we see this relationship<br />that's cultivated between Amy and Noelle.
1372872 1375875 And a lot of times we would just<br />bring Casey in and we would say,
1375959 1378211 "Okay, you guys are having
1378294 1381381 "Chardonnay-fueled girl time<br />in the afternoon
1381464 1383925 "and you're discussing Amy's sex life."”
1384008 1388805 And then we would roll and they would just<br />go on these four and five minute tears
1388888 1391808 where they would talk and talk and talk.
1391933 1396229 And it was incredibly, sort of, Oprah-like.
1396771 1399232 <i>Um, it was extremely heartfelt.</i>
1399315 1403736 Casey Wilson is one of the funniest people<br />that you can ever watch.
1403820 1405738 I mean, we would be in stitches.
1405822 1407574 And we'd have the sound<br />completely turned down.
1407657 1409367 I didn't even know what was being said<br />in the next room,
1409450 1411202 'cause I was just looking at her face.
1411327 1417834 And the stuff that they would get into,<br />and how it would make Rosamund cry,
1417917 1420336 and how Casey would react to that.
1420420 1423006 And when she would reach<br />to get her a tissue
1423256 1426342 or reach to refill her wine glass...
1426426 1431097 It's a kind of supreme physical comedy<br />that is...
1431180 1432765 It's a rare thing.
1432849 1433683 This notion that Gillian had
1434517 1437395 that we meet this guy the day after<br />his wife has gone missing.
1437478 1441190 He stayed at his sister's house<br />and he drank all night. (LAUGHING)
1441524 1445528 And I love the idea that she says to him,<br />“No, no, no, you wanna look like that.”
1445612 1447989 It's the first time that anybody is discussing
1448072 1451367 the appearances of the distraught husband,
1451451 1454412 especially 'cause it comes on the heels<br />of a scene where she says to him,
1454495 1457040 "Whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.”
1457123 1461544 And now we see them comfortably<br />sort of hunkered down in her house.
1461753 1464964 And she's telling him, "No, no, no,<br />It's okay If you have bed head
1465048 1466299 "and you look like shit. You should.
1466382 1468801 "The day after your wife goes missing,<br />that's what it should look like."
1468885 1473222 It's those kind of insights into<br />what this situation must be like,
1473306 1475475 that I think it sets Gillian apart.
1477060 1480313 So, one of the things that<br />really good actors do for you
1480396 1484776 is that they save you from<br />embarrassing moments of un-clarity.
1484901 1487737 We had shot this scene and at the end of it,
1487820 1490573 Kim Dickens kind of looked at me,<br />sort of making a face,
1490657 1492700 and I said, "What? What's wrong?"<br />And she said,
1492784 1495662 "I don't think my character<br />has ever met Margo.
1495745 1497955 "Well, how would my character<br />know who she is?"
1498039 1500208 And we were like,<br />"Quick. We need one more setup
1500291 1502502 "where Carrie walks in, stands next to you<br />and says,
1502585 1503670 “I'm Margo, the twin."".
1503753 1505588 It was one of those things<br />where you just go,
1505713 1508883 "How could we have missed that?"<br />But, thank God, somebody didn't.
1509092 1512261 This is a weird scene because<br />you need Nick Dunne
1512428 1515515 to both be human and realistic
1515598 1519102 in his not knowing how to navigate
1519185 1522772 this very odd change in his circumstances.
1522855 1525858 I mean, asking somebody to come<br />and stand before the press
1525942 1528653 and ask for help in the finding<br />of his missing wife
1528736 1530822 is such an awkward thing.
1530905 1533533 And I think he plays it so well.
1533616 1539080 At the same time he has to be<br />making the audience wonder,
1539163 1541582 "Wow, he seems a little dissociative."
1542166 1545211 And it's a tricky balance,
1545294 1549340 because there's a certain rote nature
1549424 1552969 to people who are in a situation<br />that they've seen on television.
1553052 1555638 They kind of have an understanding<br />of what they're supposed to do.
1555805 1560143 And then asking somebody,<br />"Okay, you need to evoke that.”
1560518 1562770 Lisa Banes, who plays Marybeth Elliot,
1562854 1566357 in the middle of this,<br />she launches into this CV,
1566441 1567442 (FINCHER LAUGHING)
1567567 1570528 list of accomplishments that<br />her daughter has achieved.
1570611 1573865 And it's a very telling look
1573948 1576909 into this woman's relationship<br />with her daughter.
1576993 1580329 And Lisa's very, very good at this.
1580413 1583666 And there's a certain theatricality<br />that she has to have
1583750 1589213 in order to see why Amy has the issues<br />that she has with her parents.
1589589 1595094 And Lisa was able to project that<br />to the third balcony.
1595219 1598973 And it's a wonderful interchange between
1599432 1603436 seeing how Nick takes in his<br />mother and father-in-law,
1603519 1605938 and the distance that he wants from them.
1606022 1610693 And then also as Marybeth goes into her,<br />sort of, listing Amy's accomplishments,
1610777 1612320 you can see that he and Go
1612403 1617408 don't really take Amy's journalistic<br />accomplishments that seriously.
1617700 1621454 <i>And it's a great way to show<br />just how confusing</i>
1621537 1625166 and human and complicated
1625249 1627210 the relationship<br />between all these people is.
1628211 1631589 We found this photograph of Neil
1631672 1633758 from probably the Golden Globes.
1633841 1636344 He was with an actress<br />who shall remain unnamed
1636427 1638137 because we lopped her head off
1638221 1642308 and found this other flash-lit<br />photograph of Rosamund
1642433 1643851 from the same period
1643935 1645603 and composited them together.
1645686 1652109 But I love the idea of introducing the<br />stalker ex-boyfriend in this prom picture
1652193 1654862 and that they seem so happy and so...
1654946 1658533 They're so skinny and happy<br />and youthful and clueless.
1658616 1660076 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?
1660159 1661994 I only know it was bad.
1662161 1663830 - I didn't know this.<br />-BONEY: Okay.
1663996 1665164 Thank you.
1665248 1666666 FINCHER: There's a little moment<br />at the end of this,
1666749 1668960 we're tracking out of one room<br />into the next,
1669043 1671170 and Kim stops Ben with a little,
1671254 1672713 "Can I have you for a moment?”
1672797 1676092 And I love Carrie in the background.<br />I probably shot 14 takes.
1676175 1679220 And I finally said, "Just lean out<br />like you're waiting for him,
1679303 1682974 "and you're gonna be there as long<br />as he's in talking with Boney.
1683057 1684725 “But you are kind of questioning, like,
1684809 1686394 "“When is this all going to be over with?"
1686477 1689981 And she has such a great energy about that.
1690064 1692650 It seems so appropriate.
1692733 1694193 It's not a co-dependent thing.
1694277 1696863 It's just like a,<br />"What? What's going on now?"
1697446 1698990 There are a lot of double entendres.
1699073 1700408 I don't know if they were intentional.
1700491 1702660 But I love the notion of a clue that begins,
1702827 1704620 "Although this spot<br />couldn't be any tighter..."
1704704 1707707 (LAUGHS) So I said to Patrick,<br />"Just laugh a little bit."
1707790 1710126 Like, "Is this some<br />weird kind of sexual thing?"
1710209 1713296 And I love the thing<br />that he and Kim have together
1715047 1716674 where she's just,<br />"Oh, come on. Grow the fuck up.”
1717258 1722138 One of the reasons<br />that I was drawn to Kim Dickens was
1722221 1726392 not only is she incredibly capable<br />as an actor,
1726642 1731397 but she has this gravitas to her thinking.
1731480 1735151 You can actually see her<br />taking in everything around her.
1735234 1737445 And I didn't want Boney to be a caricature.
1737528 1738821 I wanted her to be Sherlock Holmes.
1738905 1741449 I wanted her to be<br />really good at what she does.
1741532 1745202 What I love about Kim is that you can<br />give her these little things to do
1745286 1749081 and she does them so precisely<br />and economically.
1749165 1752293 Just the movement that she shows you,
1752376 1754921 the way she takes in his row of books,
1755004 1759216 the way her finger goes and touches<br />his lack of book ideas.
1759759 1764263 And she seems both, sort of,<br />calm and formidable.
1764347 1767266 And I thought that was<br />a really good combination
1767350 1769727 to balance Nick's,
1769810 1772897 kind of, expertise in duplicity
1772980 1776651 and his casualness about,<br />"Well, I don't see what the big deal is.”
1776734 1779362 And, "All we've got to do is find her, right?"
1779445 1781530 And you know something else<br />is going on here
1781614 1784492 as you see him when<br />he's a little panicked in some ways.
1784575 1785660 But you also see that
1785743 1788120 he's pretty good at covering that stuff up.
1788204 1793584 And I thought that it would be great<br />to combat what his energy was
1793668 1796212 with somebody who was very, very still
1796295 1799507 and practiced and elegant<br />in the way that they move.
1800967 1805137 One of the first conversations that<br />I had with Kim Dickens was about leaning.
1805221 1811060 As an actor she wants to show you<br />that she is into what she's doing
1811143 1813604 and she's an energetic actor.
1813688 1815731 And I kept saying to her,<br />"You can't do that with this.
1815815 1819694 "You can't lean forward.<br />You can't be off your balance.
1819777 1822321 "You have to be standing<br />straight up and down.
1822405 1824281 "You have to pivot and take everything in.
1824365 1828160 "I want you to be, sort of,<br />the calm eye of the storm.”
1828244 1832164 And it was interesting to watch her<br />take that on for Boney,
1832248 1837003 that she got comfortable with the idea<br />of just waiting for the other actor to finish
1837086 1840798 and taking them in and scrutinizing them,<br />and then delivering her line.
1840923 1842091 (ALARM BLARING)
1844552 1847471 This is a moment that could be<br />right out of The Game. (LAUGHING)
1847555 1849807 It's like alarm on top of alarm,
1849890 1853978 on top of technology that doesn't work<br />and the awkwardness of that.
1854061 1855771 And this is not easy stuff to do.
1855855 1859692 And we don't actually have<br />an alarm blaring in his ears,
1859775 1862153 and he does have lo raise his voice,
1862236 1865156 and he does have to talk over<br />somebody else who's on the phone.
1865239 1867241 And he can organize all those things.
1867324 1869618 It's very deft. It's not easy to do.
1870619 1871746 So, this was a tricky thing.
1871829 1875207 We had to have a blue house that could be<br />misconstrued for a brown house.
1875291 1877835 And one of the ways<br />that I thought we would do that
1877918 1881380 was by putting yellow or sodium light<br />on a light blue house
1881464 1883799 and that would make it sort of, brownish.
1883883 1885134 Then of course we were like,
1885217 1887678 "Well, then she's right.<br />It is a brown house.”
1887762 1890890 And then she turns on her flashlight<br />and it makes it blue.
1890973 1892349 But the flashlight itself was so blue
1894101 1896854 that I started to wonder<br />whether the audience was gonna say,
1896937 1899273 "Well, wait a minute,<br />but that flashlight's a 5600 Kelvin,
1899356 1901734 “so perhaps it is a brown house.”
1901817 1904070 So, there are definitely moments<br />on this shoot
1904153 1907156 where you can overthink shit into oblivion.
1908032 1911410 I love the beginnings of the curdling<br />of this marriage.
1911494 1912912 And it comes off
1912995 1916290 the first time he says anything<br />truly disparaging about his wife,
1916373 1919794 when he slams the steering wheel<br />and calls her a bitch.
1919877 1923047 And it should be that it begins<br />to make the audience go,
1923130 1925966 "Well, wait a minute.<br />Why is he angry with her? She's missing."”
1926050 1929345 And I really appreciate it as a story device.
1929428 1932765 This is an extension of the meet-cute.
1932848 1936852 This is a diary entry that's<br />talking about the idealized notion of
1936936 1941315 what soul mates are supposed<br />to behave like to one another.
1941398 1943192 And that they have this moment
1943275 1945569 where they disagree about<br />how something's handled
1945653 1947446 and yet find their way through it.
1947530 1950199 And you see that dramatized<br />in their relationship.
1950282 1953077 And it's a very, very important notion.
1953160 1957748 It's an important idea to see<br />behaviorally represented.
1957832 1960084 And it's very nicely drawn.
1960167 1964130 I love the idea of her<br />coming to him, 5:00 in the morning
1964213 1965631 Just before the sun's risen,
1965714 1970553 and they have slept on the day bed,<br />for whatever reason,
1970636 1974140 and they have this very, very quiet,<br />intimate conversation
1974223 1976642 about things that are worrying her
1976725 1980146 and things that she thinks<br />he needs lo start taking seriously.
1980229 1983732 And when he rises up,<br />when he sits up and he says,
1983816 1986068 "Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />That's like all of it.
1986152 1989029 "That's like all of our money.<br />That's our nest egg.”
1989113 1992491 And then they realize<br />it's really about the two of them.
1992575 1996036 The reliable narrator<br />aspect of this is irrelevant.
1996120 1999498 What's really nice about it<br />as screenwriting is that
1999582 2003586 it is one of those moments that, sort of,<br />wins you over to the idea of,
2003669 2006505 "They're on the same page,<br />they're dedicated to the same ideas.”
2006589 2010301 And it's very minimalist and deftly drawn.
2010384 2014388 (LAUGHING) The fact that it's bookended<br />with this next scene
2014471 2017349 where he is playing Call of Duty
2017433 2022813 and is surrounded by Chinese takeout food<br />and light beer cans is, uh...
2023439 2026025 One of the things I love about Gillian is that
2026108 2029320 she didn't feel it necessary<br />to have much time
2029403 2032198 between all the rest of it<br />as background noise
2032281 2035618 and, "You haven't gotten off your ass<br />in three days?
2035701 2038537 "What am I doing?<br />What is this relationship about?"
2038621 2042625 And then of course,<br />the tag on the end of it is, "Uh-oh."
2042708 2046629 The real world steps in<br />to complicate things.
2047004 2048005 Nick, I don't get it.
2048088 2051300 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2051467 2054428 The nagging shrew.<br />The controlling bitch.
2054595 2056847 -I'm not that person. I'm your wife.<br />-(GROANS)
2057014 2058057 I'm sorry.
2058349 2060476 FINCHER: I love the notion of,
2060559 2064688 somebody going missing<br />and needing a search party,
2064772 2067858 and having an appeal for public help.
2067942 2071904 I love the fact that it became this,<br />sort of, something to do
2071987 2074531 on this summer day in this small town.
2074615 2077993 The kids, sort of, running<br />to get to the common room
2079245 2081288 to hear where they're supposed to go<br />and walk single file,
2081372 2085751 and tramp through the underbrush<br />and look for remains.
2085834 2088295 Couldn't help but remind me<br />a little bit of Jaws.
2088921 2091173 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
2093509 2096512 David Clennon is an actor<br />that I have always appreciated.
2096595 2097888 I love The Thing.
2097972 2102268 But more important, I think,<br />in my most formative years
2102351 2106438 working as a projectionist at a theater<br />on Main Street in Ashland, Oregon.
2106522 2111151 I saw Being There probably 175 times.
2111235 2114905 And David Clennon is so funny
2114989 2118659 when he is playing slightly confused
2118742 2120828 and earnest. (LAUGHING)
2120911 2125541 And I was trying to, sort of,<br />formulate who Rand and Marybeth were.
2125624 2129169 And I kind of pictured a lot of<br />the couples that my parents knew
2129253 2131880 in the mid '70s in Marin County, California.
2131964 2134133 And there was a famous movie
2134216 2137428 or a famous series of articles<br />that became a movie
2137511 2139013 called The Serial.
2139096 2143100 And David Clennon is very much<br />like all of those people that
2143183 2146812 were professors or psychologists
2146895 2151817 or magazine writers,<br />mental health professionals.
2151900 2155821 And he reminded me so much of that,<br />kind of, energy of those people.
2155904 2159241 So the idea of David and Lisa was...
2159325 2160784 It was low-hanging fruit.
2160868 2162911 There's a character introduction here,
2162995 2165581 where you've seen the picture<br />of Neil Patrick Harris,
2165664 2167624 and then we see him for the first time
2167708 2170794 as this, kind of,<br />guy with expensive sunglasses.
2170878 2175174 And how tangential all of this is<br />at this moment in time,
2175257 2177426 because, really,<br />what's front and center about
2177509 2180054 everyone's questioning of Nick Dunne is,
2180137 2182681 “Is he behaving appropriately and is he..."”
2182765 2184808 And then Gillian does this nice thing where
2184892 2189188 we've seen this person who is not<br />like all the other people at this gathering.
2189271 2191523 And Ben goes after him to...
2191607 2192775 You don't know what he's gonna do,
2192858 2195861 but you respect the fact<br />that the character is curious.
2195944 2198405 And then he goes out<br />and he runs into Shawna Kelly.
2198489 2199865 And this was...
2199948 2204036 This is such a beautiful<br />21st century exploration
2204119 2207206 of the tragedy vampire.
2207289 2210167 That Nick Dunne has, in some odd way,
2210250 2212044 become kind of a celebrity,
2212127 2215297 and she wants to get a selfie with him.<br />(LAUGHING)
2215381 2217383 You know, as an audience member,<br />you're watching this going...
2217466 2218884 It seems sort of innocuous,
2218967 2222763 but the moment that the picture is taken<br />and she has it in her hand,
2222846 2227142 you kind of realize along with him<br />at the same speed,

2228310 2231939 "This can't be good.<br />This can't lead to anything but heartbreak.”
2232022 2234066 It's so weird with technology<br />being what it is
2234149 2236193 because we actually just did one take
2236276 2238779 where we pulled<br />all the gear out of the hallway,
2238862 2244076 and had them actually go through the thing<br />with the phone recording a movie.
2244159 2245953 And had them go through the whole scene.
2246036 2249206 And then we took the footage<br />that was on the phone
2249289 2252418 and matted it into the phone<br />in appropriate areas,
2252501 2255796 and then froze it for Ben's smile.
2255879 2259425 Everyone's in the other room<br />and then finally you go, "Okay, cut!”
2259508 2262761 And I run outside<br />and I pick up this Samsung phone,
2262845 2264763 and I scroll through it and I hit play,
2264847 2267933 and then there's this moment<br />where they freeze and he does that smile.
2268016 2269852 And you just go, "Okay, we got it."
2269935 2271145 I think it was like take two.
2271228 2275482 That is the most inappropriate smile<br />for this moment in the narrative.
2275566 2276775 It's perfect.
2276859 2281447 And again, beyond something<br />taking place on July 4th,
2281530 2285033 beyond the idea of a search party<br />looking for remains,
2285117 2290414 whenever you have 80 feet of dolly track<br />and a walk and talk on the sand,
2290497 2293792 it has to hearken to Jaws.
2293876 2297504 When we cast Lisa Banes,<br />it was really for this one line.
2297588 2299923 It was when she came in to read
2300007 2303886 and she said,<br />"My God, this place smells like feces.”
2305554 2308307 My God, this place literally smells like feces.
2308390 2310642 FINCHER: It was so perfect, it was just like...
2310726 2312811 This is exactly what this woman<br />would sound like.
2312895 2316523 So, I looked no further.<br />I was like, "We got this.”
2317274 2319276 (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO)
2321320 2323155 There's a lot of cop nonsense,
2323238 2326783 where they're catching up<br />to what's going on in the household,
2326867 2328368 or they're beginning to turn rocks over.
2328452 2331830 But what I love about<br />this scene coming up is that... (CHUCKLING)
2331914 2337169 ...the police are actually hiding from<br />the neighbors because it has...
2337252 2340255 It seems very, like a small town.
2340339 2343634 It seems very much like<br />the kind of thing that would happen...

2347846 2351558 NOELLE: Detective Boney,<br />Officer Gilpin? Noelle Hawthorne!
2351642 2353018 FINCHER: One of the first shots that we did
2353101 2356188 when we were, uh, shooting<br />prescheduled material,
2356271 2358690 we shot the children riding their bikes.
2358774 2361401 It was such a great shot<br />and we were gonna use it in the trailer.
2361485 2363487 We didn't really have<br />a place for it in the narrative.
2363570 2364696 And then, finally, we said,
2364780 2368367 "Oh, there is this nice moment<br />before we go to Margo and Nick,
2368450 2369785 "where we could use this."
2369868 2371620 And so we sort of shoe-horned it in there.
2371703 2373580 And it's one of my favorite little...
2373664 2377251 Again, it feels like<br />small town, middle America.
2377334 2378585 I love Missi Pyle.
2378669 2380170 We'd read a lot of people
2380254 2383549 and it was only a day and a half,<br />two days of shooting.
2383632 2387219 And we had to shoot all this,<br />sort of, bumper footage for her show
2387302 2390222 and her whipping off her glasses<br />and chewing on pencils
2390305 2393100 and looking like an investigator.
2393183 2396395 And we had all that stuff that had to<br />be part of the graphics package
2396478 2397688 of the Ellen Abbott show.
2397771 2401316 But for the most part, all of the things<br />that you see her on her show,
2401400 2403569 all that stuff is pretty much<br />done in one day.
2403652 2405946 And it was done the last day of shooting.
2406029 2411577 And so, Missi, who we cast<br />probably before we started shooting.
2411660 2414371 It was a good 104 days later
2414454 2418083 that we finally got her<br />into a little videotape studio
2418166 2420419 off Lankershim Boulevard.
2420502 2423130 <i>And Ellen Abbott is a creation,</i>
2423213 2427551 she's not meant to be based<br />on anyone in real life in particular,
2427634 2433932 but she certainly has aspects of her<br />that are Nancy Grace-ish.
2434016 2439104 I had always thought,<br />if it's based even broadly on Nancy Grace,
2439187 2442065 if we just go a little broader,
2442149 2444234 if we go a little more exaggerated,
2444318 2445819 it'll be fine.
2445902 2450324 And what we found<br />on our one day of shooting was
2450407 2451033 you can't go too far.
2451950 2455495 It's like, in a weird way<br />you kind of have to come back from it.
2455579 2459082 You don't even register it as hyperbolized.
2459166 2462544 So the weird thing was<br />to take it more seriously,
2462628 2464630 and not try to make it funny.
2464713 2468300 So this is the first half of our second day<br />on the back lot at Universal.
2468383 2471136 We needed Brooklyn.
2471219 2474056 And so we dressed<br />the bookstore on the corner,
2474139 2475807 and put some graffiti up,
2475891 2477559 and brought in a Mayflower truck
2477643 2479853 and shot this quick drive away,
2479936 2483273 which ended up taking,<br />probably about 25 takes to get,
2483357 2486777 'cause we had to get the camera<br />mounted onto the car
2486860 2490155 so that we could see the family<br />waving in the background.
2490238 2493992 And then, pan over<br />and get their little look to one another.
2494076 2495952 And getting it that concise,
2496036 2498830 getting it to be that, sort of,<br />effortless was, uh...
2498914 2500791 Took a long time.
2500874 2506505 I love the double-edged sword<br />of this part of the story which is,
2506588 2510967 we're beginning to see<br />her enforced isolation
2511051 2513178 from the rest of the people in the story.
2513261 2516056 We're beginning to see that Amy is, um...
2516139 2517391 She needs to be a victim
2517474 2520977 and we have to, sort of,<br />feel empathy for her.
2521061 2524439 There's a tiny bit of<br />an edge to this which says,
2524523 2528068 "Why aren't you running over<br />to see Mama Maureen?
2528151 2532197 "And why aren't you saying hi to Margo?<br />And why are you staying away?"
2532280 2534241 So her behavior is kind of one thing
2534324 2536201 and then there's the voiceover
2536284 2540539 which tells you how alienated she felt<br />to begin with, before they even arrive.
2540622 2543792 It's a really interesting, um, dichotomy.
2544960 2548880 And now we get to Andie.
2550799 2555387 ! like the idea of introducing Andie<br />as this kind of werewolf
2555470 2557597 that comes in the back door<br />and just will not...
2557681 2559224 Just mauls him.
2559307 2563979 And, obviously,<br />it's not something he resists very much.
2564062 2565063 (FINCHER LAUGHING)
2565647 2568608 Um, when we were looking<br />for somebody to play Andie,
2568692 2571778 it was imperative from my standpoint
2571862 2576616 that we find somebody who could<br />divide the audience immediately.
2576700 2578744 That you could literally take a broadsword
2578827 2581621 and cut right down<br />the center of the theater and go,
2581705 2584791 "Okay, women are going to<br />lean back in their chairs,
2584875 2588712 "be disgusted, cross their arms and go,<br />'He is a fucking prick.'
2588795 2594259 "And that men would put their chins<br />on their hands, lean forward and say,
2594342 2597846 <i>"'Yeah, but I mean,<br />it's kind of understandable.</i>
2599681 2603018 And Emily Ratajkowski does that. (LAUGHS)
2603101 2605729 She just has that ability.
2605812 2607647 There's a part of you that says,
2607731 2611067 "I completely understand<br />why he would make this mistake."
2611151 2617282 But it is a horrible, horrible transgression<br />and it should be punished.
2617365 2620452 And you have to have that.
2620535 2621953 We met Emily, um...
2622037 2625624 I forget. I think it was Ben who said,<br />"Yeah, the girl in the Blurred Lines video.”
2625707 2630670 And I had no idea.<br />I mean, I kind of live in an igloo in East LA.
2630754 2633965 But I had no idea about<br />the Blurred Lines video until I saw it.
2634049 2638303 I thought, "Well, this girl<br />is definitely divisive."
2638386 2642808 And I was very worried that we were<br />gonna be meeting with a supermodel,
2642891 2646937 and that this was somebody who was,<br />kind of, more interested in
2647020 2649606 what the project was gonna do for them,
2649689 2653485 than they were with what<br />they were gonna do for the project.
2653568 2658907 And Emily came in<br />and I just thought she was fucking great.
2658990 2661827 She was absolutely no bullshit,
2661910 2664663 she has no pretense, she is...
2664746 2667499 She takes direction amazingly,<br />she really listens,
2667582 2672504 and she is willing to take risks and fail.
2672587 2674840 And that's what you have to have<br />as an actor,
2674923 2676132 you have to have...
2677551 2679636 You have to know that it may not pan out<br />but it's okay, there's gonna be another one.
2679719 2682931 We're gonna keep doing it until<br />we happen onto something.
2683014 2686184 But she was completely present,
2686268 2687978 was an amazing listener.
2688061 2691523 And, by the way,<br />when she says, "Godspell."
2691606 2694150 I just cannot stop cracking up.
2694234 2696570 They're supposed to be<br />having sex standing up
2696653 2698238 at one point in this montage.
2698321 2701366 And it was Rosamund in sweatpants
2701449 2705704 and Ben with his Wrangler jeans<br />down around his mid-thigh
2705787 2707664 and as he was walking away, I said,
2707747 2710750 "I want you to say,<br />'Let's go to Outback tonight.'
2710834 2715714 "And Rosamund, I want you, no bullshit,<br />to truly appreciate that as an evening out.”
2716047 2718008 NICK: We should go to Outback tonight.
2718174 2719301 That would be nice.
2720093 2723305 FINCHER: We had been spending<br />so much time at the Outback
2723388 2726182 behind the Drury Suites
2726266 2729185 where the crew was staying<br />in Cape Girardeau
2729269 2733315 that as soon as he tried that take,
2733398 2735901 everybody on the set just started laughing.
2736026 2737068 You would hate it.
2737235 2739321 It's a bunch<br />of my dorky high school friends.
2739404 2742324 FINCHER: I love when Ben<br />turns to Rosamund
2742407 2744075 and then he puts his hand<br />on the newel post,
2744159 2746578 and you really get this idea of like,
2746661 2751333 I know that if I just tolerate<br />whatever's coming next long enough,
2751416 2753919 “if I look like I'm attentive,
2754002 2756713 “I'll be able to leave and<br />I'll be able to go out with my girlfriend.
2756796 2759090 "So, yeah, honey.<br />Of course I'm listening to you,
2759174 2761009 "you have my undivided attention.”
2763219 2765013 I really like the way this turned out.
2765096 2769601 It seemed like a really good escalation of
2769684 2773772 unspoken frustrations<br />that people have with one another.
2773855 2778568 And, obviously, it gets to a highly<br />exaggerated and hyperbolic place,
2778652 2781738 but I really felt like<br />they got to something that,
2781821 2784032 for the audience, feels like,
2784115 2787285 it's a reasonable explosion.
2787369 2790372 It's not a reasonable response,<br />but it's a reasonable explosion.
2790455 2792958 And you can get to this thing of,
2793041 2796169 "Yes, those moments are really,<br />really, really frustrating.”
2796252 2800340 When she has been biting her tongue,<br />and unhappy with the idea
2800423 2802801 that she's being left alone<br />night after night, after night.
2802884 2805887 And he is frustrated<br />because he is late in his...
2805971 2807889 For whatever it is that he is up to,
2807973 2810475 he is now not on time.
2810558 2811726 It seemed real.
2811810 2816481 The last shot of Rosamund in this sequence<br />really looks like a Hitchcock blond to me.
2817983 2819484 That really feels like<br />Grace Kelly or something,
2819567 2823113 the angle and the smudge<br />of tears and snot.
2823571 2824864 (BOTTLES RATTLING)
2826741 2828410 (SIRENS WAILING)
2829494 2830996 This was an idea that was in the book.
2831079 2833248 And it was something<br />that I felt was really important
2833331 2836876 to the texture of this small town<br />in middle America.
2836960 2839295 And I loved the idea of the mall gone bust.
2839379 2844676 And we didn't find a mall<br />that we could shoot in Missouri,
2844759 2848221 but we found there was a mall<br />in South Central LA
2848304 2850807 that has got to be a million square feet.
2850890 2854185 And the pictures of this grand escalator
2854269 2858106 that has been completely<br />picked like a carcass.
2858189 2861192 I loved this location,
2861276 2865739 even though there's no way that<br />there's a mall this size
2865822 2868033 in North Carthage anywhere.
2868116 2870368 There was originally gonna be<br />this chase sequence,
2870452 2873663 there was gonna be a girl<br />or a woman that we see in pink
2873747 2877250 at the end as they're exiting,<br />and they were gonna find her.
2877333 2881379 And she was gonna be,<br />obviously, not anything like Amy
2881463 2883673 and possibly a crackhead,
2883757 2887385 or somebody who'd been<br />homeless and living in...
2887469 2889721 And we just ran out of time in the scene,
2889804 2891306 but the scene, I think, plays.
2891389 2896478 And I love the suspicion that it clouds<br />the next part of the narrative with.
2896561 2899397 And it was never intended<br />to cut directly from
2899481 2902567 "She wants to buy a gun” to<br />“Now [ think I wanna buy a gun.”
2902650 2906446 But we rearranged<br />a lot of scenes in this section.
2906529 2908823 And it seemed to work<br />where you would ask yourself,
2908907 2911409 "Well, this is becoming very unseemly.”
2911493 2913745 And then you would get to Amy's response,
2913828 2919084 an inclusion of the unseemliness<br />into her marriage story.
2920001 2922587 AMY: That is how crazy I've become.
2923671 2927675 Nick wants me gone<br />but he won't ask for a divorce.
2927842 2931846 In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,<br />his only line of credit.
2932013 2933515 The bitch with the prenup.
2935350 2937560 I could go home to my parents...
2937727 2940021 but I'd have to tell them the truth.
2940188 2942023 And I don't even know if I believe the truth.
2942148 2943900 (WATER RUNNING)
2944067 2946861 Can I really think Nick would hurt me?
2947487 2949864 I'm being paranoid. Crazy.
2951199 2952200 It's just...
2953159 2955703 I'd sleep better with a gun.
2959874 2962961 FINCHER: This was<br />a fantastic moment on set
2963044 2967298 because I really wanted the reality of,
2967382 2969843 "You have to get up silently,
2969926 2971386 “get your clothes on,
2971469 2976432 "get your teenage girlfriend<br />out of your sister's house
2976516 2978017 "because you've overslept.”
2978101 2981980 And in the rehearsing of this notion of,
2982063 2986776 "Okay, you've got to get her dressed,<br />'cause she is still groggier than you are,
2986860 2989487 “and you have to be<br />the responsible adult here.”
2989571 2992699 And it started to look so perverse,
2992782 2996661 the notion of this 6'5" man
2996744 3000999 dressing this tiny, voluptuous mistress.
3001082 3004085 It almost looked like he was<br />getting her ready for a school bus.
3004169 3006629 It was so Lolita-esque.
3006713 3010425 I wanted Ben to shut that back door<br />as quietly as he possibly could.
3010508 3014012 We ended up having to loop<br />the whole scene to get it quiet enough
3014095 3018641 because it needed to be whispers<br />that were barely audible to the audience.
3018725 3021144 So that you really think that<br />he's gotten away with it,
3021227 3023938 only to have Carrie Coon<br />Just shatter the silence.
3024022 3025732 And when we shot the scene,
3025815 3029194 I don't think there's<br />one bad take of Carrie's line,
3029277 3030236 "You fucking idiot."”
3030320 3033531 She just let him have it each time.
3033615 3034824 She's one of my students.
3035408 3039954 The gag was an idea that<br />she kind of did it halfway on one...
3040038 3041831 And I don't know whether<br />she intended it to be a gag
3041915 3044500 or whether she intended it to be like a...
3044584 3047045 She was just so exasperated with him.
3047128 3051716 But the actual gag reflex,<br />I thought was, uh, truly funny.
3051799 3054469 And when it's delivered by a master,
3054552 3056137 it's undeniable.
3058056 3059766 This is a really pivotal scene
3059849 3062602 because you're not only<br />seeing a cad and a heel,
3062685 3068942 but you're also seeing a guy who's trapped<br />in a horror story of his own creation.
3069025 3074989 And I think that Ben is able to not only,<br />sort of, offer up the vitriol
3075073 3079244 that he is able to deliver<br />what was really going on in his marriage
3079327 3080912 and how he really felt about it.
3080995 3086209 At the same time, you see that<br />he's extremely uncomfortable
3086292 3088253 with the stupidity.
3088336 3090672 You see a guy who is wrestling with,
3090755 3093091 "I guess I deserve to be in this situation,
3093174 3097845 “and yet I literally don't know what to do,<br />I literally don't know where this is going.”
3097929 3101557 I based a lot of the relationship<br />between Carrie and Ben
3101641 3103559 on the relationship that I have<br />with my younger sister
3103643 3105853 and it's both loving and contentious.
3105937 3110900 And she would be the first person to go,<br />"You fucking idiot!"
3110984 3114195 And to have somebody<br />who can say that to you,
3114279 3117198 and you kind of go,<br />"Yeah, I guess you're right,”
3117282 3120159 was really, really important<br />to the dynamic between these two.
3120243 3124664 And the fact that Margo was<br />the one person who can say to Nick,
3124747 3127333 "Well, whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.”
3127417 3130878 I thought that was such a great, uh...
3131379 3133131 An understanding that they have
3133214 3137260 that goes beyond anything<br />they could possibly explain to you.
3137343 3139637 There was an interesting criticism about,
3139721 3144642 "Well, why is Ellen Abbott always<br />on the TV when they turn it on?"
3144726 3149439 Well there's six frames of the DVR<br />interface at the beginning of this
3149522 3152984 which shows that she is actually<br />recording these episodes
3153067 3156112 and has them available to look at
3156195 3158156 because she doesn't know<br />when her brother's gonna walk in
3158239 3161576 <i>and she doesn't want to<br />have to be watching it live.</i>
3181721 3183139 Hey, buddy.
3191939 3193399 (TRUCK BRAKING OUTSIDE)
3199030 3200698 GILPIN: I can't believe<br />we haven't arrested this guy.
3200865 3202700 BONEY: We're not gonna arrest anybody...
3202867 3204369 just because some blonde dunce says so.
3204786 3207288 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3207580 3210792 One, I am conducting an investigation,<br />not a witch-hunt.
3210958 3212752 And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever.
3212919 3214087 She was trying to buy a gun.
3214253 3216297 We don't know who<br />or what was scaring her, Gil.
3217131 3218800 FINCHER: It's an interesting<br />comment on society
3218883 3222595 when characters in movies<br />don't have to explain what luminol is.
3222678 3224097 (FINCHER LAUGHING)
3224180 3226265 It's a sign of the times.
3226599 3229644 So, luminol lit up<br />the kitchen like the 4th of July.
3229727 3232063 FINCHER: For those of you<br />who don't know what luminol is,
3232146 3237235 it's a compound that adheres fo<br />iron in your blood,
3237318 3241197 so that even if you've washed blood away<br />with soap and water,
3241280 3246369 it can adhere to the molecules of iron<br />in the blood stain that would be there
3246452 3248371 and make it fluoresce.
3249163 3250581 My wife says he's a killer.
3250832 3253167 Well, if Tiffany says...
3264262 3265763 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
3269142 3272770 This was shot near the City Hall<br />in Cape Girardeau
3272854 3278317 and they have this beautiful gazebo<br />and this wide-open area.
3278401 3283990 We were there for two nights with, um,<br />250 extras or maybe a little bit more.
3284073 3289078 And not one of these people,<br />when we would break and say,
3289162 3291122 "Okay, we're gonna move on<br />fo the next setup.”
3291205 3293958 When you do that in Los Angeles,
3294041 3295751 the professional extras,
3295835 3299005 they just scatter like cockroaches.<br />(LAUGHING)
3299088 3303259 They go looking for a place<br />to get on their cell phones,
3303342 3305136 or get on their iPads,
3305219 3310766 and getting them back, herding them back<br />is a truly a Herculean feat.
3311476 3314228 When we were in Cape Girardeau,<br />these were locals,
3314312 3317023 and we told them upfront,<br />"Here is what we need from you
3317106 3319817 “and here's what you're gonna be<br />expected to do.”
3319901 3324989 And they stood there for 12 hours,<br />pretty much on their marks.
3325072 3327283 And when we would say, "Okay, guys,<br />we're gonna take five minutes.
3327366 3329076 "We're gonna be moving<br />a camera over to here,
3329160 3330369 "you are free to go.”
3330453 3333664 They were like,<br />“No, we're happy to just watch.”
3333748 3339337 And having 250 people in a scene<br />is usually a really, really difficult thing
3339420 3342924 because the crowd itself<br />is so hard to manage,
3343007 3344175 but if you've got a...
3344258 3347720 If you have big crowd scenes,<br />go to Cape Girardeau, Missouri.
3347803 3348971 I have nothing to hide.
3351307 3352517 FINCHER: This cut-away<br />to Emily Ratajkowski
3352600 3354101 I love because I love the fact that
3354185 3356729 she's dead center in the middle<br />of the wide shot
3356812 3357855 and you never see her.
3357939 3360358 And then you cut in to the 65mm shot
3360441 3363945 and you go, "Oh, my God.<br />She stands out like a sore thumb."
3364028 3366864 And then you go into<br />the 100mm close-up of her face,
3366948 3369283 and she gives her...<br />(WHISPERING) "You asshole.”
3369367 3374872 And the fact that it's barely audible<br />is the only thing that makes it believable.
3374956 3379627 (LAUGHING) It does feel like he hears it<br />across the entire lawn.
3380503 3382964 And here comes Casey just to, uh...
3383047 3386217 Just when things are getting serious<br />and not a lot of fun,
3386300 3389845 Casey Wilson comes in<br />to change all of that.
3389929 3394433 It was funny 'cause we never discussed<br />the notion that Andie would be shocked
3394517 3396978 or that she would cover her face.<br />But I remember saying to Emily,
3397061 3400523 "Okay, so then she says she's pregnant,<br />and I need you to respond to that."”
3400606 3402525 And she came up with that,<br />I think that was like take two
3402608 3404443 and that's the one that's in the movie.
3406862 3410241 One of the most important aspects<br />of sound design is to make sure that
3410324 3414412 you're building toward a greater<br />understanding of the environment.
3414495 3417832 Because, for the most part,<br />sound design is about the environment.
3417915 3421335 And one of the things that<br />Ren Klyce is so great at
3421419 3424213 is the character of different environments
3424297 3428926 and so we had this idea to have a baby cry
3429010 3431178 right as somebody says,
3431262 3432638 "What did you do to your pregnant wife?"
3432722 3436350 And there was this awkward pause<br />and then a baby just... (CHUCKLING)
3436434 3437768 A baby begins to weep.
3437852 3439353 And I love the idea of
3439437 3443482 every creature<br />that's pro-life in this moment
3443566 3448446 is being asked to weigh in<br />on the tragedy of this lost woman.
3448529 3452533 Another aspect of that<br />is the character of the mob.
3452617 3456621 The first time that<br />Nick's at a press conference,
3456704 3458789 they're very polite,<br />I mean, they're insistent,
3458873 3460541 but they're very polite to him.
3460625 3463127 And at the moment in time<br />that we realize that
3463210 3466589 his wife who has disappeared<br />may or may not have been pregnant,
3466672 3469508 all of a sudden they become<br />extremely hostile.
3469592 3472303 It is... The switch has been flipped
3472386 3475181 and they're now 180 degrees.
3475264 3477350 It's a lynch mob.
3477433 3479602 We spent the whole day<br />shooting this one scene.
3479685 3482438 Except for the inserts of the photographs.
3482521 3484982 And it's one of those scenes<br />that sort of blocks itself.
3485066 3486817 As soon as the actors came in,
3486901 3489987 and we knew that we wanted<br />to have Kim walk over across here,
3490071 3493324 we knew that the special effects guys<br />had rigged the mantelpiece
3493407 3494784 for the pictures to fall.
3494867 3498162 And we had all that stuff<br />sort of worked out.
3498245 3502500 But it's one of those scenes that sort of<br />comes together on its own
3502583 3506796 because it's very obvious from the drama<br />what it is that has to happen.
3506879 3508673 But it was really effective.
3508756 3512843 And it's oddly effective<br />because it's really well-written.
3512927 3514679 And it's the thing of,
3514762 3519809 if you're following the right<br />kind of emotional map,
3519892 3524271 the actual specifics of it, um,<br />become really apparent
3524355 3526524 and this is one of those.
3526607 3529860 I knew that we were gonna be<br />there all day shooting this,
3529944 3533989 but there was something about it.<br />For every change of setup,
3534073 3536534 you can tell that the actors will get drained.
3536617 3537702 But then we would come back
3537785 3540037 and they would be<br />just as good as they were before,
3540121 3545584 because they liked the motion<br />through the obstacles of the scene.
3545668 3548337 They got it. It made sense to them.
3548421 3549422 I don't even golf!
3549964 3554218 FINCHER: I love the idea of Nick Dunne<br />finally pointing out to the police,
3554301 3557722 "Wait a minute. This is a felony.<br />We have to do something about this."
3557805 3561767 And it's like, "Dude, what do you think<br />murder is? (LAUGHING)
3561851 3565104 "Are you confused about<br />what the circumstances are here?
3565187 3567773 "What the consequences are<br />of your actions?"
3567857 3574196 Singani 63 is an alcoholic beverage<br />that's imported by Steven Soderbergh
3574280 3577742 and I gave him a choice as to what scene
3577825 3581495 he wanted his Singani to appear in.
3581579 3583748 He chose a later scene
3583831 3587585 where Rosamund Pike<br />violates herself with the bottle.
3588002 3593424 When she was offered either an exquisite<br />French Chardonnay or the Singani,
3593507 3597970 she chose the Chardonnay<br />for actor reasons.
3599680 3600681 MALE REPORTER: Margo!
3600765 3602141 (OVERLAPPING SHOUTING)
3606854 3610691 FINCHER: I love this cat. This cat's name<br />is Cheetoh because he looks like a Cheetoh.
3611025 3616489 And, uh, Cheetoh was not very healthy,<br />I think Cheetoh was a little dehydrated,
3616572 3619450 his fur was a little greasy and matted.
3619533 3622244 And he didn't seem to hear very much,
3622328 3624455 I don't know that he saw very much.
3624538 3628626 But the beauty of Cheetoh is<br />wherever you place Cheetoh
3628709 3631295 that's where he was<br />gonna stay for that day,
3631378 3634632 so continuity with Cheetoh<br />was never an issue.
3634715 3638469 If you put Cheetoh on the stairs<br />you could shoot for nine hours
3638552 3640012 and at the end of the day go,
3640095 3644308 "Cheetoh's at the bottom of the stairs,<br />you can just go pick him up.”
3644391 3646435 He was fantastic.
3648479 3650856 I love this argument between<br />the two of them because
3650940 3654735 they really do seem like they<br />know each other
3654819 3658948 and the fact that the things<br />that are upsetting to her
3659031 3660825 seem like the kinds of things
3660908 3662785 If somebody is truly invested in you.
3662868 3665204 In a way, more important than anything,
3665287 3669667 she resents the fact that<br />she's behind the eight ball
3669750 3672628 as to what's really going on.
3672711 3676090 And you see that rift.<br />She's trying to tell him,
3676173 3678384 "You have to be aware of how this looks.”
3678467 3682221 And it looks terrible, as somebody who<br />desperately cares about you,
3682304 3683889 it looks terrible.
3683973 3686642 And the fact that she has to<br />keep explaining it to him
3686725 3689520 is what makes her more and more angry.
3689603 3693065 And it's like somebody<br />who's getting to the point of saying,
3693148 3696694 "God damn it, don't you see<br />how much I fucking love you?"
3696777 3701699 And Carrie does that so well, it's so caustic
3701782 3707288 and at the same time caring,<br />and that's a really interesting mixture.
3707371 3713961 And in the wrong hands it could<br />either be too earnest and emotional.
3714295 3716213 And I really like the way that you see
3716297 3719508 most of it through<br />her eyes and her behavior.
3720050 3723888 And we get to a very odd idea<br />at the end of this, which is,
3723971 3726807 "I would never ask you that question,”<br />and, of course,
3726891 3729810 that's the only question<br />she really wants to ask.
3729894 3731729 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3731896 3732897 Your prenup?
3733230 3736066 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3736233 3738027 I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!
3740905 3743908 I love you no matter what.
3744074 3745326 But you need to tell me.
3745492 3746911 Tell you what?
3747745 3749371 What are you asking me?
3750956 3754126 Are you asking me if I killed my wife, Go?
3754585 3756545 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3757838 3759548 FINCHER: And there's Cheetoh<br />at the bottom of the stairs
3759632 3761675 after 14 hours of shooting.
3761759 3766847 Whenever we cut outside and we see<br />the, um, locusts, the media locusts
3766931 3770643 around the Dunne house,<br />we always tried to include
3770726 3773103 somebody in the distance<br />laughing about something,
3773187 3774605 like they're on their phone.
3774688 3776857 But that notion that
3776941 3781070 it's a very serious high-stakes issue<br />for the guy in the house,
3781153 3784323 but outside the house<br />it's just another day at the office.
3784907 3785908 (SIGHS)
3791622 3795501 This is a musical cue that was just...
3796377 3798587 It has this sort of ground<br />acquisition pace to it
3798671 3803175 that feels like clues coming together,
3803258 3805678 but we could never find<br />a place for it earlier on
3805761 3809598 because it has this strange,<br />eerie momentum to it.
3810599 3813310 It was funny when this scene<br />started coming together,
3813394 3816271 when we started really<br />fine-cutting the scene,
3816355 3820275 all of a sudden, it started to work perfectly<br />in the reveal.
3820359 3824697 In the moment that had the reveal of<br />what is going on.
3825698 3829994 AMY: Picture me.<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.
3830244 3833580 FINCHER: The flares...<br />We shot the entire movie spherically
3833664 3836750 with Leica Summilux lenses,
3836834 3840170 so there were no anamorphic lens flares.<br />We added those later
3840254 3842923 just to be irritating.
3843757 3845300 Just to fuck with people.
3846135 3849304 We went with Leica lenses because<br />they were really beautiful,
3849430 3853017 they're as flat and perfect as<br />the Master Primes.
3853100 3856520 But we didn't have anywhere near as many<br />back-focus issues.
3856603 3860941 I had a lot of issues with<br />Master Primes and RED cameras.
3861025 3864361 And I don't know why that is,<br />but, um, we didn't have...
3864445 3868198 We had one lens of this Summilux set<br />that had some issues,
3868282 3871785 it was a 40mm that we sent back<br />a couple times,
3871869 3875914 but for the most part it was a great set<br />and they're beautiful.
3879835 3883922 And this sequence, really,<br />the footage of Amy in her sweater
3884006 3887176 leaving the bedroom and locking herself<br />in the guest room,
3887259 3889678 that was from an earlier sequence
3889762 3891930 where Ben returns home<br />and is brushing his teeth
3892014 3895642 and she's questioning<br />whether or not she feels safe
3895726 3898062 and then we have that sequence of shots
3898145 3901398 where she walks into the guest bedroom<br />and locks the door.
3901482 3906612 And we moved it because<br />once we had moved the gun sequence,
3906695 3909406 <i>"I wanted to buy a gun, I went to a mall<br />and tried to buy a gun."</i>
3909490 3912409 Once we had moved that sequence,
3912493 3915788 we had moved things<br />out of their intended sequence so much
3915871 3918749 we ended up cleaving that section<br />off the back of it.
3918832 3924379 And then we had it to use<br />and it felt really right
3924463 3928342 in the maelstrom of information<br />that's leading up to the reveal
3928425 3931386 that Amy is indeed alive.
3931470 3934932 AMY: This man of mine may kill me.
3936308 3938310 He may truly...
3939228 3940270 kill me.
3942940 3944066 WTF?
3961875 3966672 FINCHER: So, when I was reading the book,<br />I got to the point of the twist
3966755 3968549 and I'm reading it,<br />and I suddenly become aware
3970676 3973095 there's an inevitability to this reveal.
3973178 3976890 There's inevitability to the idea that this<br />movie is nowhere near as simple
3976974 3980811 as just the pregnant wife victim.
3980894 3984356 And this speech, the cool girl speech
3984439 3987651 which is gonna be sort of tacked on to<br />bringing the audience up to speed on
3987734 3990154 <i>this is what you've really been watching.</i>
3990237 3992156 It's a very tricky moment.
3992239 3996160 One of the things that Gillian and I<br />talked a lot about was,
3996243 3999830 initially, this movie talks<br />about some ugly things,
3999913 4004209 but it has to talk about ugly things<br />in a way that's amusing.
4004293 4008672 And we talked about Lolita.<br />This was a movie in 1962
4008755 4012509 that's about a pedophile and yet<br />the movie's not about pedophilia,
4012593 4017681 and it's not a cautionary tale of taking<br />sophisticates into your home
4017764 4020392 and putting them<br />in charge of your daughter.
4020475 4025606 It's a movie that has to talk about<br />extremely disturbing things,
4025689 4027858 and at a time<br />when you weren't allowed to even
4027941 4030986 say some of the words that the book uses
4031069 4032863 to talk about its subject matter.
4032946 4039077 So they figured out a way to kind of get<br />beyond people's reticence to even engage,
4039161 4041538 and one of the ways they did it<br />was through humor
4041622 4043832 and one of the ways that they did it was...
4043916 4046627 Certainly when we were<br />talking about Desi Collings,
4046710 4048712 we talked a lot about Clare Quilty
4048795 4051298 and how this is a character who<br />doesn't necessarily
4051381 4052883 have to exist in the real world.
4052966 4056428 He can be a figment of our imagination.
4056803 4060807 And this was a moment<br />where we talked about...
4060891 4062392 I think we talked about Vertigo.
4062476 4066647 And, for me, the incredible<br />dissatisfaction in Vertigo
4066730 4068398 that is the letter that gets written,
4068482 4071610 that explains to Scottie<br />everything that's happened.
4071693 4074988 And I felt very much<br />that if we didn't have a sequence
4075072 4078575 that had a density of information<br />and that didn't really show you
4078659 4081328 in incredibly uncompromising terms
4081411 4083830 what went down...
4084373 4087292 It needed to be a sequence<br />as smart as its villain.
4087376 4090921 And I think that Gillian wrote that.
4091004 4093340 And I think that the<br />density of the information
4093423 4096551 and the thought process behind these ideas
4096635 4099930 really kind of draw you<br />to this character in a way.
4100013 4103267 At the same time that she is<br />morally repugnant,
4103350 4108188 she's also fascinating and I think<br />that that's her saving grace.
4108272 4111358 She's really fucking interesting.
4112859 4116863 AMY: ...with just enough mistakes<br />to raise the specter of doubt.
4118282 4120242 You need to bleed.
4120575 4121576 A lot.
4122202 4123870 A lot a lot.
4127207 4129042 A head wound kind of bleed.
4129710 4132212 A crime scene kind of bleed.
4135215 4137217 You need to clean poorly...
4137384 4138427 like he would.
4139094 4141596 Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.
4142222 4144808 And leave a little something behind.
4145475 4147227 A fire in July?
4148603 4149730 And because you're you...
4149896 4151148 you don't stop there.
4151565 4153650 You need a diary.
4153817 4156737 Minimum, 300 entries<br />on the Nick and Amy story.
4157404 4159573 Start with the fairy tale early days.
4159740 4161908 Those are true. And they're crucial.
4162075 4164077 You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.
4164411 4166913 After that, you invent.
4167581 4172669 FINCHER: One of the things that took<br />a long time to put together, um,
4172753 4174338 as far as I was concerned,
4174421 4179176 one of the things that kept me from saying<br />yes to this movie for a number of months,
4179259 4181261 was my insistence
4181345 4184639 with Jim Gianopulos, the head of Fox,
4185140 4189353 that we can't use any footage from fade out
4189436 4192272 where we reveal<br />what's happened with Amy.
4192356 4195025 We can't use any of that footage<br />in the trailer.
4195108 4200364 We have to limit ourselves to showing<br />Amy only in the flashbacks
4200447 4204701 because I don't wanna see her...<br />Ozarks Amy, I don't wanna see her.
4204785 4208872 The one shot that I did allow<br />was the underwater shot
4208955 4210248 because I felt...
4210332 4212542 I liked the idea of it setting the stage for,
4212626 4215879 "Did or did he not kill his wife?"<br />And not, "What happened to his wife?"
4215962 4218215 But, "Did he or did he not kill her?"
4218298 4223428 And I felt like that footage helped us<br />make that mystery pointed.
4223804 4228100 But it was a really, really interesting,<br />tough marketing constraint
4228183 4230685 because, as much as everybody agrees,
4230769 4234981 in theory, yes, we don't wanna<br />give away the twist,
4235065 4237859 when push comes to shove<br />and the movie's not tracking
4237943 4239528 and people are worried about
4239611 4241571 whether anyone's gonna show up<br />on Friday night.
4241655 4243698 The first thing that happens is, people go,
4243782 4246159 "Well, we have this great joke<br />that happens later...
4246243 4249496 "If she does come back<br />covered in blood that would be great.”
4249579 4253083 And it took about three months<br />and a lot of conversations
4253166 4257212 with Jim and with Emma Watts<br />at Fox, to say,
4257295 4259339 "You're going to have to agree to this.
4259423 4264428 "You're going to have to back the play<br />that if you don't bury the lead
4264511 4269391 "and if you market this movie as,<br />'Here's a stupid guy and his crazy wife'
4269474 4271226 “there's no reason to make the movie."
4271309 4275147 You have to give people that enjoyment<br />at least of finding that out.
4275397 4277190 Eventually everybody agreed,
4277274 4282946 but it made it really hard to get people<br />into the theaters to watch the movie
4283029 4287576 'cause we were very limited from<br />a teaser to a trailer, to television spots.
4287659 4292330 We were limited to the first 54 minutes<br />worth of footage,
4292414 4294124 we couldn't use anything else.
4294207 4296710 But I did feel, in my heart of hearts, that
4296793 4300630 if we go a little bit beyond,<br />"Is this a Scott Peterson story?”
4300714 4304468 You could go a tiny bit beyond that,<br />but really, the major takeaway is
4304551 4308972 related to the marketing, had to be,<br />"Did Ben Affleck kill his wife?"
4309723 4313268 It was very important to me<br />and to Rosamund that
4313351 4314478 we're not asking...
4314561 4316354 There are characters that she's gonna meet,
4316438 4318607 Jeff and Greta, who are already staying
4318690 4323487 at these cabins in this<br />recreational center in the Ozarks.
4323570 4329367 And they need to be in the same room<br />watching footage or photographs
4329451 4335040 of Rosamund Pike on television and they<br />can't be able to recognize her
4335123 4339836 and I really hate it in movies where<br />somebody puts on glasses
4339920 4342464 and people can't recognize... (LAUGHING)
4342547 4347552 They're unable to recognize Clark Kent.<br />People can't make that connection.
4347636 4352516 So, one of the things that we had to do,<br />or that we felt we needed to do
4352599 4355185 and it had been described<br />really beautifully in the book is that
4355268 4358021 she gains weight. She wears Spanx.
4358104 4361441 She's not a size two,<br />she moves up to a size eight
4361525 4363193 and her husband doesn't notice it.
4363276 4368031 And it allows her to dye her hair<br />this sort of mousy color
4368114 4374204 and get a sunburn<br />and buy very weak reading glasses,
4374287 4376831 and Greta especially doesn't recognize her.
4377666 4382504 And I think that we were 80%<br />successful in creating a version of Amy
4382587 4385549 that she would have been able<br />to get away with this.
4385632 4387467 That was extremely important to me,
4387551 4389928 and I felt that Rosamund
4390011 4393223 did an enormous amount of hard work,
4393306 4399688 gaining 12 to 15 pounds and then losing<br />12 to 15 pounds in 15 days, 20 days.
4400105 4401898 It's not easy, it's not safe.
4401982 4404359 I mean, we had doctors<br />that worked with us
4404442 4407571 and trainers that worked with her to<br />map this out,
4407654 4409698 but it's not something you wanna do.
4409781 4411658 Just ask Robert De Niro.
4412659 4415912 So we're describing a relationship<br />between a brother and sister,
4415996 4418373 and they are very, very close.
4418456 4421293 So close and they're so respectful<br />of one another
4421376 4425714 that they've never really<br />talked about his wife...
4425964 4426965 (FINCHER LAUGHING)
4427716 4431511 ...in the way that they probably<br />should have or would've wanted to.
4431595 4434222 I mean, I think that the reality<br />of the relationship
4434306 4440312 between Go and Nick is very wisely<br />and correctly described
4440395 4443690 in that these are things<br />she would never have let him in on.
4443773 4447235 The fact that she always thought<br />his wife was a crazy bitch
4447319 4451615 was something that comes out<br />of this ridiculous situation,
4451698 4453742 this completely absurd...
4453908 4457412 I maintain that the movie<br />begins as a mystery,
4457495 4463126 and then hands off the baton to an<br />absurdist thriller.
4463209 4466212 In a mystery, you don't know<br />how many plates are in the air.
4466296 4468256 In a thriller, you know how many<br />plates are in the air
4468340 4470467 and you know which ones<br />can't hit the ground.
4470550 4474929 So, the movie has to make this transition<br />between what happened to Amy to
4475013 4478058 how is this gonna resolve itself?
4478141 4483021 How can this possibly resolve itself<br />when she is kind of a criminal mastermind
4483104 4486816 and as vengeful<br />as anybody you will ever meet?
4486900 4489986 Are the people who are left<br />to pick up the pieces
4490070 4491529 going to be smart enough
4491613 4494407 and will they be cut enough slack<br />in terms of public opinion
4494491 4498244 fo be able to piece together<br />a life going forward?
4498578 4500789 And I think that that's...
4500872 4502666 For my money, I'd never seen that before.
4502749 4505835 I've really felt like Gillian had described
4505919 4509005 a movie that I would wanna see,<br />and that I haven't.
4509089 4511132 And I thought that was...
4511216 4512676 I love the idea of the Post-it notes.
4513176 4516680 I love the idea that it's not<br />only something that Boney does,
4516763 4518014 where she shows up and she says,
4518098 4520475 "Oh, this is interesting,<br />remind me to come back to this later,”
4520558 4523687 but it's also something that Amy uses.
4523770 4525689 It shows her attachment to the
4525772 4530276 criminal unfolding, or unwrapping,<br />or criminal origami.
4532696 4536074 And I love the idea of going through<br />a calendar that says,
4536157 4540370 "Oh, and by this date, should<br />you have killed yourself? By September.
4540453 4542288 "I think you will have to...
4542372 4545083 "One will have to commit to killing oneself<br />in one way or another.”
4545166 4547961 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast death metal at 4 AM...
4548294 4550088 FINCHER: This is one of the first things<br />that we shot.
4550171 4553216 It's probably day two or day three
4553299 4557387 <i>in Giant City, Illinois,<br />where we shot the</i> Ozark <i>sequence.</i>
4557470 4562058 And it was actually this very,<br />very beautiful recreation, uh...
4562142 4565478 This village of cabins<br />in this great recreation center.
4565562 4570108 They allowed the crew to stay there,<br />and they allowed us to shoot there,
4570191 4573903 and it was probably more like<br />the Ralph Lauren version
4573987 4576364 of what was described in the book.
4576448 4582078 It was really not the white trash<br />hub for motocross and boating.
4582162 4585623 It's extremely elegant,<br />and we shot there for a couple of days.
4585707 4587917 And it was the beginning of the shoot.
4588001 4591171 It was literally the first couple of days<br />that we were shooting.
4591254 4597218 And it was really awkward to ask<br />Rosamund to start with the lie version,
4597302 4601389 one facet of Amy that has nothing to do<br />with who Amy really is.
4601514 4604392 She's playing a person<br />playing another person
4604476 4605935 and she's playing a person playing
4606019 4608271 somebody that she hasn't really thought...
4608354 4612901 The real Amy hasn't really thought<br />Ozark Amy through to the greatest extent
4612984 4616529 because she's eventually<br />going to be found out.
4617113 4619866 So she can't have done<br />such a good job that we're
4619949 4624037 surprised that Greta and Jeff<br />figure out that she's on the run.
4632212 4633671 (LAUGHING)
4633922 4635465 And this is the fabulous Lola Kirke.
4635548 4638968 Lola Kirke came to us, did an audition,
4639052 4643556 could not be further from<br />this person that she's playing.
4643640 4648645 She is not a street-smart kid,<br />she's, sort of, wonderfully
4648728 4652732 really smart, really, really funny,<br />really worldly,
4652816 4655902 very, uh, astute.
4657695 4658738 Nebraska.
4659447 4665161 FINCHER: So Boyd Holbrook plays Jeff<br />and Boyd was a model.
4665245 4666955 I'd seen him in...
4667413 4671167 I guess the first time that I'd seen him<br />he was playing one of
4671251 4674754 Liberace's lovers in Steven Soderbergh's<br />Behind the Candelabra
4674838 4676840 and he is nothing like this,
4676923 4680343 but he came in and blew our minds<br />with his bizarre...
4680426 4686182 He's like the lovable hick,<br />he's just so fabulous to watch.
4686724 4690645 They're a great couple.<br />They have this great energy.
4690728 4693356 And I love the way at the beginning<br />when we introduce Boyd,
4693439 4697527 we see that Lola could not<br />be less interested in him.
4697610 4699237 And then, of course,<br />the next time we see them,
4699320 4704075 they're like riding go-karts together,<br />playing miniature golf
4704158 4707829 and it's just like<br />you watch this relationship happen.
4708121 4709581 Certainly against whatever it is
4709664 4713459 she had set out thinking<br />she was going to do with Jeff.
4715295 4718339 This is a really important flashback to me.
4718423 4720592 You needed to see Amy heartbroken
4720675 4723845 and you needed to see why she went to...
4723928 4726723 I mean, this is not to condone<br />her behavior in any way.
4726806 4732854 But it's to explain her break with reality.
4733354 4736900 And as it's described in the book,
4736983 4741029 it's one of these things that has<br />to be this beautiful romantic moment
4741112 4746075 that somebody steals<br />from their earlier pick-up line
4746159 4750830 and uses to consummate<br />this other relationship
4750914 4753124 that pushes her over the edge.
4753207 4760131 So, I wanted it to be hyperbolically,<br />serenely, perfectly executed.
4760465 4763384 And so we actually,<br />in the creation of the snow,
4763468 4765595 everything's falling<br />perfectly straight down.
4765678 4768932 Nothing is swirling,<br />nothing is moving side-to-side
4769015 4773811 all the snow that's added later<br />is almost like ribbons of pearls.
4774687 4778149 The tramp stamp was Lola Kirke's idea.
4778775 4781861 I'm not lukewarm on it now.<br />Al the time I was.
4783279 4787825 So, the idea of your life being suddenly...<br />You're on 60 Minutes
4787909 4791746 or an aspect of a question mark<br />about your life is now
4791829 4794290 food for network news.
4794707 4798211 I thought that Gillian came up with<br />a really fun way of doing that
4798294 4800546 which is, he walks by Sharon Schieber
4800630 4804050 on a big plasma screen TV in the airport.
4804133 4807887 I did one day of second unit stuff<br />in New York City,
4807971 4811808 and then we shot<br />this sequence in Los Angeles.
4811891 4813476 And here comes Tyler Perry.
4813559 4818314 And Tyler Perry watches people<br />in the scene unlike many actors.
4818398 4821526 He is extremely present.
4821985 4825113 It was one of those casting choices<br />where you have an instinct.
4825196 4828074 And I just called him up and said, "Listen.<br />I would love to send you this script,
4828157 4830368 "and you would be doing me a great favor<br />if you would read it,
4830451 4831786 "and tell me what you think."
4831869 4835957 And he was kind of like,<br />"Are you sure you want..."
4836040 4838126 He is very, very humble.
4838209 4839669 A very humble man.
4839752 4842797 And it was exactly<br />that quality that I think...
4842880 4846759 In the book, he is much more<br />of an Alec Baldwin from Malice.
4846843 4853516 He is much more of a smooth,<br />articulate, insensitive blowhard.
4853599 4857061 And I loved what Tyler<br />naturally brought to this,
4857145 4859147 which is... He is a talk show host.
4859230 4862066 He listens and he puts you at ease,
4862150 4866195 and I love the fact that<br />Tanner Bolt became somebody,
4866279 4868740 who when he says,<br />"Here is what you're gonna do tomorrow.
4868823 4870074 "You're gonna go on Diane Sawyer,
4870158 4871743 "who is going to fly all the way out here.
4871826 4873703 "And yeah.<br />She is going to expect a revelation.
4873786 4875163 "And the revelation that<br />you are going to give her
4875246 4878624 “is that you've been banging<br />your 20-year-old student.
4878708 4881294 "And this is the best way<br />to get out in front of this."
4881794 4884130 If that information is delivered<br />by somebody
4884213 4887383 who's a bit of a huckster... Or too slick.
4887467 4891846 I don't know if it would move the audience<br />to understand why he does what he does.
4891929 4895391 So the fact that it was Tyler Perry<br />saved us from a lot.
4895475 4898227 You have to prove<br />that Nick's gone to the right guy,
4898311 4899687 and I love the idea of...
4899771 4903983 He says somebody's name<br />and Tanner types it into his BlackBerry
4904067 4907195 and five seconds later, it's like,<br />"Here is the guy's home address."
4907278 4910031 And you just go, "Wow. That was good.”
4910114 4914744 It was so much fun shooting this scene<br />because you finally got to see
4914827 4915953 this other aspect to this story,
4917371 4919791 which was, "Things are getting absurd.
4919874 4922710 "And somebody<br />has to appreciate it for that.”
4924212 4928716 Scoot McNairy. So, Scoot McNairy<br />was a last-minute addition.
4928800 4933763 I love the idea of a character<br />who describes himself like,
4933846 4936599 “Do I look like<br />I would do good on the yard?"
4936682 4940228 I love the idea of somebody saying,<br />"Could you imagine me in prison?"
4940311 4942730 And that was basically<br />all we were looking for,
4942814 4946025 is an actor who could wear that line,
4946109 4949445 and you would go,<br />“No. I guess I understand.
4949529 4953950 "You would definitely want to plead guilty<br />in order to avoid that."”
4954033 4957745 And there is something so funny about...
4957829 4959622 He is very smart.
4959705 4966170 And he has a way of turning<br />desperation into, um...
4967088 4968631 It is very understandable.
4968714 4971509 And we were lucky enough<br />to be able to find a moment in time
4971592 4975847 where he was not shooting<br />his television show.
4975930 4978141 And he came in and we did one day.
4978224 4980977 We scrambled like mad<br />to do this in one day.
4981060 4987984 But it was so worth it to have him<br />as part of a menagerie of great performers.
4988734 4992989 One of my favorite moments<br />in movie history is in Manhattan
4993072 4997702 where Diane Keaton has been talking<br />about this ex-lover of hers
4997785 5001831 who was somebody<br />who really opened her sexually
5001914 5005334 to radical ideas of intimacy.
5005418 5010339 And the entire time, Woody Allen<br />is kind of freaked out about this...
5010423 5013551 Somebody who is a professor of hers and...
5013634 5015678 And finally he meets Wally Shawn.
5015761 5019765 And Wally Shawn plays<br />the devastating ex-lover.
5019849 5022518 And I love the idea of... (LAUGHING)
5022602 5027231 "You are going to meet the person<br />who may or may not have raped Amy."
5027315 5028983 And then you meet Scoot.
5029066 5032862 And Scoot is like,<br />"Me? Do I look like a rapist?”
5032945 5035114 I needed somebody<br />that you would look at and go,
5035198 5038117 "He is a lot of things.<br />But a rapist, he is not.”
5038201 5042121 He makes half of his case<br />Just by showing up in this scene.
5042205 5043289 ...and raped her.
5043456 5044790 Me!
5044957 5046584 And then, guess what they find.
5046751 5048794 Headboards of my bed, one on each side.
5049212 5050421 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5050588 5051923 You do know your wife.
5052590 5054300 -Did you ever see her again?<br />-Yeah.
5054467 5055885 On TV, last week, with you.
5056469 5057762 I thought, "There's Amy.
5057929 5060056 "She's graduated from being raped..."
5060139 5064101 FINCHER: I love the idea of putting<br />Noelle Hawthorne on Ellen Abbott.
5064185 5067980 And I love the idea of giving her<br />all these things to talk about,
5068064 5070566 that of course, are of interest to her.
5070650 5075571 She is sort of launching her program<br />at the same time as Ellen Abbott.
5075655 5079283 There is a lot of co-opting going on<br />in this sequence,
5079367 5083537 and they happen right next to each other<br />in these mortised panels.
5083621 5087124 We started the whole sequence<br />where we see Casey,
5087208 5091629 and it was really important to me that<br />we have a truck drive by in the background.
5091712 5095299 So, you really get the idea that it's like,<br />it is truly a remote unit,
5095383 5098135 and they're going, "Three, two, one.<br />Get that truck out of here.”
5098219 5102890 And then she begins talking and you have<br />the whole earwig thing where people are...
5103015 5106060 They're not quite hearing each other<br />at exactly the right time.
5106143 5109772 You have Ellen Abbot who is<br />behaving in a way that is,
5109855 5112608 "Oh, thank you so much<br />for being a friend of the show,
5112692 5114777 “friend of the program<br />and a friend of Amy's.”
5114860 5117571 And of course,<br />the hilarity of it for me is that
5117655 5122285 Lola Kirke, Greta, is the most cynical<br />about it. (LAUGHING)
5122368 5126455 She's the one who's looking<br />at this going, "Ugh. Look at these people.
5126539 5131711 <i>"Just once I'd like to hear somebody say,<br />'She was a real rag.'" </i>
5133462 5134964 He never introduced himself.
5135131 5137383 ELLEN: Why was that, Noelle?<br />Why do you think?
5137550 5138551 NOELLE: / think we know why.
5139343 5141470 Because he had a violent temper.
5141637 5142638 A little harsh.
5142722 5144181 That's life, baby.
5144348 5145641 He knew I'd have seen right through him.
5146851 5148060 Don't get me wrong.
5148227 5149979 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
5150146 5153566 I'm just saying, there are consequences.
5155693 5156652 Fuck, yeah.
5156736 5159030 She was so alone.
5159196 5160990 And she was so innocent.
5161157 5164493 You're a good friend, Noelle.<br />And you're a good friend of the show.
5164660 5165745 -Thanks for coming on.<br />-(PHONE RINGING)
5165911 5167246 Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.
5167413 5169582 Tanner Bolt landed me.
5169749 5172918 I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings<br />on my way home.
5173085 5174920 And, Go...
5175087 5178257 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5178716 5180176 That's just the retainer.
5180551 5184055 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
5184221 5187183 I'm approved for a second mortgage<br />on the house. We will go from there.
5187350 5189101 Thank you.
5189852 5191395 -I love you.<br />-I love you, too.
5191562 5194190 Nick keeps his father,<br />who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.
5194357 5196359 Number of times he visited last year? One.
5196442 5197526 Oh, fuck!
5197610 5200196 His twin sister, Margo, well, she is a peach.
5200363 5202698 These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.
5203282 5205284 Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?
5205451 5206452 What the fuck?
5206619 5209288 Twin siblings often enable and abet.
5209789 5211624 While I never examined Nick, or his sister...
5211999 5214210 FINCHER: There's a moment described<br />at the end of this scene
5214293 5218381 where, uh, Nick Dunne has to reach<br />into his duffel bag or his backpack
5218464 5221550 and get out a baseball cap<br />that he's bought at the airport.
5221634 5223344 And he puts it on and walks away
5223427 5227098 and hopes that people don't recognize him<br />from the television
5227181 5230393 and put together that that's him,<br />that he's in their presence.
5230476 5234313 And I really wanted it to be a Yankees cap...
5234522 5235898 (FINCHER INHALES DEEPLY)
5235981 5237900 ...but being from Boston
5237983 5242530 and not being very professional as an actor,
5242655 5243989 Ben refused to wear a Yankees cap.
5244907 5248160 We did not come to blows,
5248244 5251247 but we had to shut down production<br />for four days
5251330 5253249 as we negotiated with Patrick Whitesell
5253332 5257128 over what would be<br />the best thing for the movie.
5257211 5259255 What Patrick thought would be<br />the best way
5259338 5261340 to meet the requirements of the production
5261424 5264468 and something that his client<br />could live with,
5264552 5268264 which I thought was<br />entirely unprofessional.
5268347 5270516 I'd like to report some strange activity...
5271517 5275354 FINCHER: I love this cue. I love...<br />Whenever called upon,
5275438 5282194 Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross<br />can find a sound for insanity.
5308512 5309722 (DOORBELL RINGS)
5310264 5311724 We shot this in Los Angeles.
5311807 5316812 We were looking for a house<br />that really screamed old money.
5317062 5318606 This was a fun scene to shoot
5318689 5323652 because it was the first time<br />we ever spent real screen time on Desi.
5323736 5327406 And this is the first time<br />he comes out of his cave and you see him
5327740 5331243 and we have to really, desperately believe
5331327 5336373 that he's somebody who could've<br />done harm to Amy
5336457 5340961 and could be working against<br />the investigation and finding...
5341045 5344673 And yet, I wanted him to be able to play<br />completely straight
5344757 5347676 that he never liked Nick,
5347760 5350179 never trusted Nick, never wanted to be...
5350262 5353557 This was not a relationship<br />that he ever condoned.
5353641 5357436 And you can kind of see all of those things<br />working in this scene.
5357520 5362191 It's a tribute to good actors when subtext
5362274 5365861 that was originally<br />part of a whole big setup
5365945 5370533 can kind of just be played in the<br />foreground, in the moment, in the present.
5371408 5373619 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5377289 5379124 Mr. Collings.
5381210 5383128 Fuck.
5388759 5391637 MAN: (ON RADIO) ...the missing persons<br />case of Amy Elliott Dunne.
5393055 5394056 FINCHER: And I love this idea.
5394139 5397142 This is definitely a scene<br />that we probably could have cut,
5397226 5400980 but the notion that his...<br />That the bar that he runs
5401063 5404358 is overflowing with lookie-loos
5404441 5407861 who want to get their selfies<br />in front of the... (LAUGHING)
5407945 5411615 In front of the bar where that guy<br />may have killed that woman.
5413075 5415286 This was a fun scene.<br />This is one of those scenes that...
5415369 5418080 It's a thankless, thankless job when...
5418163 5420583 It's just a little bit more color,
5420666 5424962 but I love the fact that we gave time<br />to Boney to be able to say,
5425045 5426338 “I don't know."
5426422 5429592 I love the way she phrases,<br />"I've never found that to be true.”
5429675 5431093 And I love the way she tosses it.
5431260 5433470 (GROANS) The whole thing just feels hinky.
5433637 5435598 Like finding an envelope marked "Clue."
5435764 5436765 You ever hear the expression...
5436932 5438684 "The simplest answer<br />is often the correct one"?
5439476 5441353 Actually, I've never<br />found that to be true.
5441520 5443314 -Good night.<br />-Good night.
5445983 5446984 Hey.
5451113 5453699 FINCHER: On the day we were<br />shooting all the fliers,
5453782 5455618 I just got sick of shooting fliers.
5455701 5460164 It started to feel to me like the riot<br />sequence from Gangs of New York.
5460247 5464084 It was like fliers on bulletin boards<br />and fliers on...
5464168 5466378 And there was one.<br />One of them got trampled
5466462 5468505 <i>and it was right next<br />to a bunch of cigarette butts.</i>
5468589 5473594 And I thought, "No, by day five or day six<br />of this whole thing,
5473677 5476639 "people would be fed up with Amy Dunne.
5476722 5480017 "There would be a couple of fliers that<br />had been wedged into the gutters
5480100 5481810 "and we should see those."
5484229 5486148 This is, again, a fun scene with...
5486231 5489777 I love the relationship<br />between Margo and Nick.
5489860 5494323 And I love the fact that she's doing things<br />that he doesn't see.
5494406 5497534 She's doing things<br />that he wouldn't appreciate.
5497618 5501080 And yet, it tells you so much about<br />how much she cares about him
5501163 5505000 even though she's had it up to here<br />with him.
5505501 5507169 -This leads us to what?<br />-My dad's house.
5507336 5509088 Dad's house is blue.
5510089 5512466 FINCHER: Gillian came up with<br />a very, very interesting idea
5512549 5515344 which is the house that the father...
5515427 5518013 After the divorce, the father had this house.
5518097 5521975 And he created this whole fantasy<br />in his head
5522059 5526522 of how his father justified that<br />he never saw his kids anymore.
5526605 5529817 And it's a very minimal idea,
5529900 5532027 but it's very deftly done.
5532111 5534613 So, what in God's name<br />is at your father's house, Nick?
5534780 5535823 And be honest.
5535906 5537741 I honestly have no idea.
5541620 5543831 FINCHER: This is a great line reading.<br />There's just no two ways.
5544915 5548627 Whatever they found,<br />I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.
5548711 5551547 FINCHER: (CHUCKLES) It's the thumb.<br />The thumb is what makes it.
5552965 5556051 Nick, do you have any idea<br />as to what Andie's mindset is?
5556260 5558929 Well, we haven't communicated<br />since the vigil.
5559763 5561348 FINCHER: This is a diner in Burbank
5561432 5564643 that I had never shot at before<br />and I had never seen,
5564727 5567312 and it's one of those things that<br />as soon as you shoot at a place
5567396 5573068 and you actually become aware<br />of the Naugahyde and the wood paneling,
5573152 5577239 and the plastic...<br />The yellow plastic textured glass,
5577322 5580451 all of a sudden you see it<br />in every single commercial.
5580534 5583537 And you just wanna<br />shoot yourself in the head.
5583620 5586165 It's like, "Oh, I really thought<br />that worked for our movie."
5586248 5588834 And apparently it works<br />for almost everything.
5590085 5591503 Oh, God.
5591670 5593088 FINCHER: Carrie Coon learned the hard way
5593172 5596508 that the last thing you<br />want to do in one of my movies is eat.
5598927 5601013 She probably sucked down at least
5602431 5604516 five-and-a-half pounds of French fries.
5606769 5608395 I have no idea.
5608729 5610689 FINCHER: This was fun, actually.<br />This scene was, um...
5610773 5615068 This was one of those nights where<br />stupid shit was just happening.
5615152 5617780 And we had sort of...<br />It took a long time to figure out
5617863 5619907 how we were gonna film this scene,
5620032 5622409 because we didn't wanna do<br />ass loads of coverage.
5622493 5627164 It needed to be a concise,<br />simple telling of the story.
5627498 5631293 <i>And yet, it's a complex little interaction<br />between these three.</i>
5631502 5633837 And then, of course,<br />she has to hit a hole in one,
5633921 5637925 and I actually...<br />On two occasions, Rosamund...
5638258 5640928 One went in and bounced out.
5641011 5642721 And the other one went in. She hit...
5642846 5646016 I mean, again, it's probably a 40-foot putt<br />or something,
5646099 5650020 so it's not like hole 12 at Valhalla.
5650103 5652564 But the first time she hit the ball,
5652648 5655275 and she hit it a little hard,<br />it kind of went in and popped out.
5655359 5659029 And everybody was, "Oh!"<br />And the second time she sunk the putt,
5659196 5661865 but we didn't pull focus on it.
5661949 5663575 We didn't catch it with the focus.
5663700 5665494 So we ended up doing it in CG.
5665953 5670541 But there's a lot of work that went<br />into this scene, making it this simple.
5670624 5673168 All the head turns,<br />and where everybody was looking,
5673252 5676088 and how the ideas are being passed along
5676171 5678173 that she's been found out.
5680342 5682010 It's mostly singles.
5682177 5684054 Singles? What are you, a stripper?
5684847 5687432 Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?
5688559 5689601 GRETA: We're just teasing.
5690394 5692187 Don't they tease people down in NOLA?
5694606 5697442 ELLEN: (ON TV) We can expect Nick Dunne's<br />arrest any day now.
5698068 5699444 FINCHER: And I love this little scene.
5699528 5702739 <i>I love the idea that her<br />television doesn't work</i>
5702823 5706201 which is the only reason<br />she's putting up with Greta.
5708287 5709788 ELLEN: We'll be right back.
5709872 5713709 FINCHER: And I like the similarity between<br />the coverage on this moment
5713792 5718213 and the exact same mirrored thing<br />was happening with Nick
5718338 5721758 when Andie comes over to Margo's house.
5721967 5724177 It's almost exactly the same pieces,
5724261 5728724 except one is this paranoid criminal mind,
5728807 5732895 and the other one is the paranoid,<br />unfaithful husband.
5739860 5742112 This was something,<br />when we shot in Cape Girardeau
5742195 5745407 on about the third or fourth day<br />at this location,
5745490 5747784 people started showing up<br />with folding chairs
5747868 5750412 across the street on the lawn.
5750495 5753749 And the AD came up to me and said,
5753832 5756501 "We will get them... Don't worry.<br />By the time we start shooting,
5756585 5758170 "we will get all these people out of here.”
5758253 5760505 I was like, "It's kind of perfect.”
5760589 5762674 It's kind of exactly what you want.
5762758 5765802 What you want is the sense of, uh...
5766970 5771767 Gretna Green across the street<br />from Nicole Brown Simpson's.
5772476 5775145 This is a scene where you see
5775228 5777189 exactly how great Tyler Perry is,
5777272 5781401 because he understands this<br />better than you.
5781818 5785113 When he tells you<br />this is about public perception,
5785197 5787950 he does it in a way that says
5788033 5789368 he knows what he's talking about.
5789451 5792371 This is no longer about right and wrong.
5792579 5795958 This is no longer about reality.<br />This is about perceived reality.
5796166 5798293 And I love his reading of,
5798377 5800504 "A trained monkey<br />that doesn't get the lethal injection.”
5800587 5801588 A trained monkey?
5801755 5803799 A trained monkey<br />who doesn't get the lethal injection.
5805133 5808470 Nick, this case<br />is about what people think of you.
5808637 5810263 They need to like you.
5810430 5814267 Now, you do this<br />and you will reach millions of those people.
5815435 5817938 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5824569 5825737 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
5827197 5828156 Hello?
5828240 5829449 GRETA: Hey, baby.
5830909 5832494 One minute.
5841253 5842587 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
5842713 5843672 You clearing out?
5843755 5845465 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5845632 5847092 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5847259 5848260 I'll come by before--
5848343 5850095 Let us give you a hand.
5852597 5853974 FINCHER: This is an interesting scene,
5854057 5856727 because, I think, it was actually kind of hard
5856810 5860063 for Lola to manhandle Rosamund.
5860147 5861940 And Rosamund is...
5862024 5867237 When it comes to stunts,<br />she's not an actor. She doesn't act stunts.
5867320 5869906 She's not going to fake a head snap.
5869990 5872034 So we ended up shooting a lot of takes
5872117 5876705 of Lola Kirke knocking<br />her semi-unconscious.
5876788 5880208 And it almost required her<br />to be knocked semi-unconscious.
5880834 5884713 But the take that's in the movie<br />is spectacular in that it is...
5884796 5887924 I mean, there's a rubber pad that's<br />built into the walls that looks...
5888008 5890427 It's textured exactly<br />like the walls around it.
5890510 5892345 So there's plaster on all the walls
5892429 5896683 except for the one where Lola's<br />gonna smash Rosamund's head.
5896808 5902606 But she still had to do it so hard<br />that I think, Rosamund saw stars.
5902689 5906985 When she started screaming her, "Oh!"<br />Is really because she got whacked.
5907736 5911573 And when Boyd picks her up<br />and tosses her on the bed, he was...
5911656 5915827 I mean, the first, like, 15 takes,<br />he was so polite about it,
5915911 5918080 and finally Rosamund"s like,
5918163 5920082 "Just toss me, dude.”
5920165 5923335 And he threw her across that room.
5923752 5925337 It was pretty spectacular.
5925879 5928548 Sorry, but we really need the money.
5928715 5930217 GRETA: Next place, be more careful, okay?
5930383 5932552 There are a lot of people out there<br />a lot worse than we are.
5939059 5942062 FINCHER: This was something that<br />she came up with on the day,
5942145 5945232 was her scream into the pillow<br />and it was, uh...
5947067 5950570 I loved the idea of this kind of anger
5950654 5957119 boiling underneath this very lovely<br />and controlled exterior.
5959079 5961414 We were shooting this on location<br />in Cape Girardeau
5961498 5964709 and as we were filming this sequence,<br />we were shooting the master shot,
5964835 5968547 this car drove by, and it was summer,<br />So it was pretty warm.
5968630 5970132 We were wetting everything down,
5970298 5974344 and the window rolled down and somebody<br />yelled out of the cars passing by,
5975262 5977472 “Night, exterior, shitty motel.”
5977556 5980684 And then they drove off<br />in the distance laughing.
5980767 5984396 And we were all sort of standing around<br />going, "Okay."
5997784 6002038 This is a fun scene.<br />This was many, many, many takes
6002122 6006793 because I really, really wanted to get these<br />gummy bears bouncing off of his forehead,
6006877 6008545 or getting caught in his hair.
6008628 6012340 The first one that lands in his collar.<br />It only happened once,
6012424 6014384 but you had to have two cameras on it.
6014467 6017262 And so it's that thing of<br />you need enough little pieces
6017345 6019848 that you can construct the version of it
6019931 6023810 that really feels like, "Wow.<br />He just pegged him every single time."
6025395 6028398 It's a very funny scene.<br />I really like the idea of...
6028481 6030734 If you've ever been prepped for deposition,
6030817 6033612 this is the, uh, amusing version of it.
6034321 6035864 Let's talk about your mom,<br />how close you were.
6036031 6037073 Go on.
6037240 6039618 For a while, things had been building up.
6039784 6043163 "Built up" implies<br />that an explosion is coming. No.
6043330 6045749 At a certain point,<br />we got on the wrong track.
6046583 6048084 I had a moment of weakness.
6048251 6050670 Your "moment" was over 15 months.
6054466 6056551 I disrespected my wife.
6057219 6059638 And I disrespected my marriage.
6060096 6061473 And I'll always regret it.
6062015 6063016 That works.
6063099 6065393 Don't be afraid to play up<br />the dufus husband thing, Nick.
6065560 6067020 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.
6067103 6068104 "Everything I do is wrong."
6068188 6070232 I know. What men are<br />supposed to do in general.
6072359 6073360 -Thank you.<br />-TANNER: How do you feel?
6073443 6076655 I feel good.<br />Go, can you pass me that box, please?
6077072 6079574 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me.
6079699 6080700 You hate that watch.
6080784 6082744 No, Go. I love that watch.
6082911 6084788 Just like I love this tie.
6084955 6088083 Just like I love my wife.
6094756 6098593 FINCHER: This is a matte painting.<br />We shot this casino in Los Angeles
6098677 6101596 down on Normandie at the freeway.
6101680 6103807 And I remember<br />asking the camera operator,
6103890 6105600 "And then tilt up at the end and tilt up.”
6105684 6108144 And he was like, "Why?<br />Why do we keep tilting up to see the sky?"
6108228 6110605 And I was like, "I wanna put a river boat<br />behind that.”
6110689 6114693 And he was like, "Okay." And when you put<br />the river boat in, it changes everything.
6116695 6119114 So again, for his sins,
6119197 6123868 here's Desi, drops everything to come<br />and be the best possible
6123952 6125745 ex-boyfriend you could imagine.
6125870 6128039 And she is working him.
6128123 6131126 This is the one scene that we shot where<br />we didn't have control of the extras
6131209 6134170 because we were shooting<br />in a working casino.
6134254 6136715 And it worked perfectly. It worked...
6137007 6139968 It was great.<br />I don't think we looped any of this.
6140051 6141678 I think we used all of the audio
6141761 6145223 because it's such a manic<br />and crazed background,
6145307 6148143 it didn't matter as long as we got<br />good tracks in the foreground.
6149394 6152605 The great news about shooting<br />in a casino is that
6152689 6154816 If you don't have control<br />over the background,
6154899 6157319 the last thing you need to worry about<br />is people looking in the lens
6157402 6159738 because they're all watching their money.
6160488 6163658 And so they are extremely, um...
6163742 6165243 Their interest is elsewhere.
6165368 6167078 They were very easy to control.
6167162 6168913 We just kept giving them chips.
6169914 6172083 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?
6172250 6174085 He should go to prison for what he's done.
6174169 6175253 (LOUD CHEERING)
6176921 6179257 I'm setting you up at my lake house.
6179424 6180425 It's utterly secluded.
6181843 6183553 Why are you so good to me?
6183720 6184929 You know why.
6185096 6186097 Excuse me.
6186264 6188099 -I know you, don't I?<br />-No.
6188266 6190101 You're one of the Nolan girls, right?
6190268 6192937 -No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.<br />-Onh.
6193021 6194022 We should leave.
6194105 6195190 -(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)<br />-Just a second.
6195357 6196691 FINCHER: So here comes Sela Ward.
6196775 6200820 And Sela Ward is<br />this amazingly attractive woman
6200904 6204741 who is so smooth and so polished.
6204824 6206868 And so she has that, you know...
6206951 6209662 She's a pageant queen.<br />She's just got that...
6209746 6213041 She has that ability<br />to just walk into a room,
6213124 6215627 turn every head and begin speaking.
6216002 6219506 And it serves Sharon Schieber so well.
6222258 6223551 MALE REPORTER: (ON TV)<br />We go live to that story now.
6223676 6224677 Oh, my God.
6224761 6227389 FINCHER: The character in<br />the book's name is Andie Hardy.
6227472 6232227 And I was the one that<br />pointed out to Gillian,
6232394 6236481 "You know Andy Hardy<br />is already a character in movies.”
6236564 6240735 And she was like, "Oh, God. Of course.<br />That's where that came from."
6240819 6244781 So for months, because, I don't know why,
6244864 6248326 but I guess nobody in the Internet<br />wants to do any, um...
6248410 6250954 No one wanted to go to IMDb or something.
6251037 6254958 But it was Emily Ratajkowski<br />to play Andie Hardy,
6255041 6258169 and I was, "This is going to be<br />really interesting.”
6259712 6262006 ANDIE: (ON TV) My prayers go out<br />to everyone who loves Amy.
6262173 6265176 I apologize for the pain<br />this has caused them.
6270890 6273977 FINCHER: This is Lisa Banes<br />at her most Lisa Banes-like.
6274060 6276312 And I adore her.
6276396 6281109 <i>And I find her so watchable when she's...<br />(LAUGHING)</i>
6281192 6284279 When she is just this side of tears.
6284362 6285947 It's always fun for the audience.
6287031 6289159 Well, this just got very exciting.
6289868 6291578 We need a moment.
6293580 6295206 We're gonna have to bow out of this.
6295373 6297041 -Nothing has changed.<br />-Everything has changed.
6298418 6301212 FINCHER: I think this is one of my favorite<br />line readings ever.
6301296 6303339 This Carrie Coon right here.
6303423 6306176 -I can handle it.<br />-She's going to eat you alive.
6306759 6309762 FINCHER: When she says,<br />"She is going to eat you alive."”
6309846 6312599 It's that moment of<br />somebody saying to you,
6312724 6314767 “Look, you need to understand
6314893 6318188 "you're not qualified<br />to think for yourself right now."
6318521 6320440 I mean, I think she probably did it...
6320523 6321691 We did that 17 times.
6321774 6325153 That reading of it was...<br />It just brought me to tears every time
6325236 6326529 'cause it was so...
6326613 6329491 "I care for you too much to let you go off
6329574 6332869 “and be the asshole that<br />you're lining up to be right now.”
6334496 6335497 (SIGHS)
6335580 6337207 (DOING VOICE EXERCISES)
6337290 6339083 One, two, three, four, five.
6340251 6342337 FINCHER: This is an awkward scene to shoot
6342420 6345507 because you have to shoot the videotape<br />footage that you're going to see
6345590 6348092 on the interview later.
6348301 6350720 And so we shot everything<br />with the RED here,
6350803 6354015 and then we shot all this footage<br />with the two video cameras.
6354140 6356768 <i>And trying to get them to match,<br />oh, my God.</i>
6358102 6363024 And I love this... I love the notion of,<br />like, leading up to this big moment
6363107 6364692 and then you cut away<br />from the big moment
6364776 6365860 and people are talking about it.
6365944 6367862 And then you gotta wait to experience it
6367946 6372283 with the character that it was all<br />intended to be... It was all produced for.
6373201 6376871 It's a very smart attention to chronologies<br />as it relates to story-telling.
6376955 6379666 Sharon airs tomorrow,<br />we'll be looking at a whole new you.
6379832 6381292 But until then...
6381459 6383294 don't show your face.
6383461 6385296 No problem.
6389342 6393096 FINCHER: This was a house that<br />was owned by a lovely family
6393179 6397267 who was generous enough<br />to let us shoot in.
6397392 6398935 It was immaculate.
6399018 6401521 It's one of the most beautiful homes<br />I've ever been in.
6401604 6404816 And it was in, uh...<br />It was just outside Cape Girardeau.
6404899 6408319 We wanted Desi fo be somebody...
6408403 6411030 Desi has inherited a lot.
6411114 6413783 And he is extremely wealthy.
6414033 6419414 And yet, there has to be an element<br />of him that is homey and real.
6419497 6422917 And so this house is<br />both beautiful and elegant.
6423001 6428089 And also has this incredibly<br />woodsy comfort factor to it.
6428172 6431134 And so when he's talking about the things<br />that he finds beautiful
6431217 6434762 or the things that he finds comfortable<br />or comforting about this,
6434846 6438600 it's a great match between Nell,
6438683 6440768 who is so smooth
6440852 6444272 and so elegant and so at ease,
6444355 6446357 and yet, you also want him to be...
6446441 6450612 You didn't want him to be just this<br />kind of weirdo in the woods.
6450695 6454407 He also had to have something<br />about him that was truly decent.
6456576 6457994 And the house really helped with that.
6458077 6459787 The house sort of, you know...
6459871 6462457 Had this just been this weird rustic cabin<br />kind of thing,
6462540 6463750 I think we would have...
6463833 6466127 But the fact that it was so...
6467170 6469213 It's so Frank Lloyd Wright.
6470131 6472050 I'm so exhausted.
6473551 6475720 I'll leave you to it, then.
6477472 6480224 Amy, I am so happy that you are here.
6480308 6481309 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
6481392 6484228 And I don't want you to worry<br />for one moment.
6484395 6486230 There are cameras everywhere.
6486397 6489150 The exterior, all along the grounds,<br />the entryway.
6489317 6490318 Anyone...
6491361 6494155 FINCHER: That's one of my favorite little<br />flourishes there when he...
6494238 6495782 When he turns on the television<br />and you see
6495865 6499494 all those close-circuit television<br />angles of the house.
6499577 6501663 And then he has it on his cell phone.
6501746 6504874 And then when he closes the cell phone<br />it just lets you know,
6504957 6507335 "Don't worry. I'll be watching everything.
6507418 6509212 "And you couldn't be more safe.”
6509295 6513591 And of course, she's reading it as,<br />“I couldn't be more trapped.”
6521849 6523851 I could not imagine who Desi was.
6523935 6525561 And I kept asking Gillian,
6525645 6529107 "Who is this guy? I mean, is he somebody<br />in your family I can meet?
6529190 6531609 “Is he an uncle? Is he somebody that...
6531693 6534821 "I want desperately to know<br />what you based this on.”
6534904 6537740 And she kind of admitted that it was a...
6537824 6539534 He doesn't want to be a contrivance.
6539617 6543746 We don't want him<br />to just be a literary conceit
6543830 6546791 that moves the story and makes it<br />possible for these things to happen.
6546874 6548584 He has to kind of come from...
6548668 6552046 But there was 60 pages of setup
6552130 6554841 as lo who Desi was in the book.
6554924 6557218 And we didn't have that. We didn't have<br />his mother, we didn't have...
6557301 6559303 So I was just like...
6559387 6560680 It's kind of one of those things
6560763 6564475 where you've painted yourself<br />into the corner in the narrative
6564559 6568521 and you now have to have somebody<br />who does these things for your story.
6568813 6570857 I think the best rule of thumb is
6571107 6573818 find the most watchable actor<br />you can possibly find.
6574318 6577739 And I've joked about this before,<br />but it really is true.
6577822 6582076 Anybody who can make me<br />watch the Tonys is probably...
6582243 6583953 You're probably in good hands.
6584036 6586038 You were never under my thumb.
6586622 6588541 -On your leash.<br />-Never.
6589417 6590752 FINCHER: I think this is a good example
6590835 6595631 of why Rosamund had to gain the weight<br />and lose the weight.
6595715 6599218 She has plumpers in,<br />she's wearing a little bit of a fat suit on her.
6599302 6605725 But 12 pounds on somebody who is as lithe<br />as Rosamund is shows up.
6605808 6610229 But it shows up in areas, maybe,<br />that you don't necessarily want it to.
6610396 6613107 We had to make her feel<br />like she was 10, 15...
6613191 6615860 I would've liked her<br />fo be 20 pounds heavier,
6615943 6619113 but you just can't burn that off<br />and put it back on
6619197 6620281 and burn it off again.
6620364 6622742 So, with 12 pounds and plumpers
6622825 6626287 and a little bit of chub on her chub suits,
6626370 6628539 and wearing kind of baggy clothes,
6628623 6631125 we were able to make it so that,
6631209 6635213 when she's here and she's eating<br />custard over and over and over again,
6635296 6637965 and watching television, you kind of go,
6638049 6641177 "Okay. She's moved in."”
6644889 6646057 Great.
6647099 6649060 Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.
6649227 6650853 -Tonight, exclusively...<br />-Hurry up.
6651771 6656025 A husband breaks his silence,<br />not just on his wife's disappearance...
6656192 6659987 but on his infidelity,<br />and all those shocking rumors.
6660279 6663074 FINCHER: And I love<br />what Neil does here with...
6663157 6666702 He's just...<br />He's basically an extra in this scene
6666786 6669038 who does everything that's...
6669121 6673709 Almost everything that's going on,<br />everything that we're clocking on her
6673876 6679006 has to do with how Neil<br />is taking in her movements.
6679090 6681926 <i>The things that<br />she's eating compulsively that...</i>
6682093 6685429 When she's sitting down,<br />what she's going to next.
6685513 6689100 (LAUGHING) She starts to eat his custard.
6689267 6693229 And then at the end,<br />I love when she picks up the iPad
6693312 6695481 that controls his whole home theater,
6695565 6697191 and she's licking her fingers.
6697275 6700987 And you just get this look on his face like,<br />"Please don't touch that."”
6702530 6705533 I didn't come forward with my affair...
6705700 6708870 because I knew it<br />would make me look really, really bad.
6709704 6711372 But I don't care about that anymore.
6711539 6713040 I just want to find my wife.
6713207 6715626 SHARON: I'm just trying to get clear--<br />NICK: Let me be clear.
6715793 6720089 Just because I am not a murderer<br />doesn't make me a good guy.
6720256 6721424 I'm not a good guy.
6721841 6724302 I was a bad husband to a great wife.
6724677 6726429 I broke the vow that I made to her.
6726679 6729223 SHARON: Those are pretty words, Nick.
6729557 6731183 But what does that really mean to you?
6731350 6733394 It basically means that I was a con artist.
6734353 6737440 I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.
6737607 6739191 I was completely transfixed.
6739650 6741444 Amy can do that to you.
6741611 6744030 I was this average guy<br />from an average place...
6744196 6746073 with mediocre aspirations.
6746240 6748618 And I met a woman who dazzled me.
6748784 6750620 And I wanted her to love me...
6750786 6753122 so I pretended to be better than I was.
6753289 6755875 FINCHER: There's a moment here<br />where, um...
6755958 6760379 Neil picks up a bottle of wine and sort of<br />loudly pours himself another glass
6760463 6765635 <i>because he's tired of the television<br />getting all the attention.</i>
6767136 6768262 NICK: Instead of doing what was right...
6768387 6772099 FINCHER: I love the idea that wine pouring<br />could be distracting for her
6772183 6774936 and she actually gets<br />sort of pissed off at him.
6775519 6779357 We would, in trying to do this<br />interview with Sharon Schieber,
6779482 6782443 it was really important to me that<br />it feel real,
6782526 6784278 the manipulation of it.
6784362 6787406 That he has to genuinely<br />kind of win you over,
6787490 6788783 and win her over.
6788866 6792078 And this is truly funny stuff.
6792161 6796040 From my standpoint, I really...<br />I thought Ben had
6796123 6800252 great wit in how he manipulated Amy.
6800711 6803381 You're the best person I've ever known.
6803547 6807885 And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br />for the way that I've treated you.
6808052 6809804 And if you come back, I promise...
6809887 6812932 FINCHER: And again, you always<br />have the voice of reason in there
6813015 6815768 which is Carrie Coon looking, going,<br />"Oh, God, dude.
6815851 6817728 "This is just insufferable.”
6819480 6820481 I love you.
6822525 6826070 FINCHER: I love when Neil<br />takes the custard from her
6826570 6828906 and starts to walk away<br />and then he sees her
6829156 6833828 manhandling his iPad with...<br />Licking her sticky fingers.
6834870 6836372 SHARON: Regardless of what you thought...
6836539 6838582 NICK: What does it say?
6838749 6840167 ...I think we can all agree...
6840334 6841711 Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.
6841877 6843671 FINCHER: I'm not sure that<br />we would get this kind of
6843754 6847675 an instant response to Nick's performance.
6847758 6849927 But it works for the story.
6850261 6854265 And Sela is so wonderfully assuring
6854348 6857268 in her reassessment of Nick Dunne.
6860104 6863232 I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.
6863315 6864859 (DOORBELL RINGING INSISTENTLY)
6864942 6866527 I love Kim Dickens.
6866610 6870031 When she's serving a warrant,<br />that warrant is served.
6871032 6873117 I usually ignore tipline calls...
6873284 6877872 but a neighbor was concerned about<br />a strange man around your woodshed.
6878330 6881459 FINCHER: This is a sequence where<br />we were shooting on location,
6881542 6884462 the backyard of this house,<br />and we had this shed there
6884545 6889050 that was filled with all the planted toys<br />and expenditures
6889133 6891719 that Amy leaves to incriminate Nick.
6891969 6895264 And as we were shooting<br />the temperature was dropping.
6895389 6899310 This was supposed to be<br />one of our last nights in Missouri.
6899602 6901479 And it was about 40 degrees outside.
6901562 6902730 You could see everybody's breath.
6902813 6906108 And we were all in<br />kind of jackets and sweaters.
6906192 6908903 And then it started to drizzle<br />and then it started to rain.
6908986 6912573 And so we ended up shooting<br />Just plates of the house
6912656 6914742 with the cop car and the lights on.
6914825 6916786 And we shot everybody green screen
6916869 6919622 and put them back<br />into the background plates
6919705 6921999 because we just, literally, ran out of time
6922083 6923918 that we could be in Missouri.
6924001 6925711 And it's one of those things that's like...
6925795 6929799 It's not something<br />that I will actually avoid in the future.
6929882 6932468 It seems like a really good way to
6932551 6933677 save oneself.
6936305 6938182 There's a critical moment in this scene
6938265 6942436 where Amy realizes<br />that she's been preying on his,
6942520 6945314 what she knows to be his desire for her.
6945397 6949110 And she has this moment<br />where she realizes he's...
6949527 6951612 When he says,<br />“I'm not gonna force myself on you.”
6951695 6954698 Of course what he means is,<br />"I just might force myself on you."
6954907 6957118 I'm not gonna force myself on you.
6957201 6959120 FINCHER: I was trying to<br />explain it to Rosamund.
6959203 6961622 I said, "You have to include this word.
6961705 6965918 "You have to make it all about<br />the notion of behaving.
6966043 6969672 "There's something<br />about being the supplicant
6969755 6971632 “to somebody else's domination.”
6971715 6975094 And when she said,<br />“I've forgotten how to behave.”
6975177 6979473 And then he, of course,<br />understands the sub-context,
6979557 6982143 or the sub-communication that's going on.
6982226 6985688 And he sits down<br />and he starts to play with her hair.
6985771 6988399 And Neil Patrick Harris is so funny.
6988482 6990234 'Cause when he's playing with her hair,
6990568 6992903 he's so looking past her.
6992987 6995948 And at the same time,<br />she's watching him look past her,
6996031 6997491 and she is enraged.
6997700 7000452 And you realize, in this moment,<br />that he is not going to survive this story.
7002329 7003914 She's not spending<br />another fucking second in there.
7004415 7007501 FINCHER: This scene is one of the last<br />things that we did in Missouri as well.
7007585 7012006 This is probably take 27,<br />and I think we did three takes within this.
7012089 7013507 I would just send them<br />back to the beginning
7013591 7015509 and say, "Okay, guys, start again.”
7015593 7021515 I really wanted to see Tanner Bolt's<br />frustration with the fact that
7021599 7023434 Nick Dunne is just not getting it.
7023517 7025644 This is not about reality.
7025728 7029690 And there's a palpable and playful
7029773 7033527 and ultimately exhaustion with his,
7033611 7037031 “It's not sinking in, it's not staying,<br />he's not getting it."
7037114 7043120 <i>And I love how irascible Tyler is,<br />and how he's...</i>
7043621 7047041 I love seeing him at the end of his rope.<br />He's very, very funny to me.
7047958 7049126 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7050586 7054381 FINCHER: There's a lot of talking<br />and there's a lot of stuff
7054465 7056467 that has to get covered in this scene.
7056550 7061096 And there's a lot of moves in this<br />and when you shoot a scene like this,
7061180 7065226 you've got to have people<br />who are committed to the idea of
7065309 7069521 getting all these ideas across<br />and finding places for them.
7069605 7072066 At what point is Tanner Bolt...
7072149 7073776 At what point is he going to be shifty?
7073859 7078948 At what point is he gonna look and really<br />take in what Boney is trying to cage Nick.
7079031 7080115 I never touched her.
7082534 7084161 She tried to buy a gun.
7085496 7088123 FINCHER: This was something that we<br />came up with on the day
7088207 7090709 because they had had this scene<br />that we'd already shot in Missouri
7090793 7094421 where he says, "The truth is my defense.”
7095089 7098592 Then in this scene where he volunteers,
7098676 7101178 "Yeah, that does kind of<br />look like my wife's handwriting, "
7101303 7105099 and Tyler becomes so upset with him,<br />and then when Boney leaves.
7105182 7106475 TANNER: For future reference...
7106642 7108852 the truth, you are not a handwriting expert.
7109520 7112898 FINCHER: I asked Tyler, I said,<br />"Just point out to him.
7112982 7115776 "By the way, you're not expected to<br />incriminate yourself,
7115859 7118112 "so you're excused from<br />being a handwriting expert.”
7118195 7121407 And I love the camaraderie between them,
7121490 7124285 the palpable frustration<br />between the two of them.
7124368 7126829 We found this day one,<br />in the fireplace in your home office.
7126996 7129540 We didn't know what the hell it was,<br />but fire in July?
7129707 7131583 -We bagged it.<br />-I've never seen that before either.
7131750 7134253 BONEY: We just tested it.<br />Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7134420 7136505 So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...
7136672 7138173 you're under arrest<br />for the murder of your wife.
7138340 7139425 Do not say another word.
7139591 7140926 -What about my side?<br />-Nick!
7146265 7148684 FINCHER: So now, the movie<br />gets really weird. (LAUGHING)
7149893 7155691 Now, Rock Hudson and Doris Day<br />are in their Frank Lloyd Wright home
7155774 7162281 in the trees around a lake<br />somewhere in Missouri.
7162865 7168037 And it was never expected that<br />this be particularly realistic.
7169330 7173167 It's incredibly hyperbolic.<br />And it's gonna get weirder.
7173250 7178422 And what I love about this is how<br />these guys took to...
7178505 7180424 I mean, this is such a weird thing to say.
7180507 7183635 Okay, you're in lingerie,<br />and you gotta go to the office,
7183719 7189683 and she's gonna tell you a story about<br />how much she hates her ex-husband
7190100 7194355 and how you stand apart from him<br />and people like him.
7194605 7198192 And he does that little thing<br />where she talks about Proust,
7198275 7201528 and he does this little, "What can I say?”
7201612 7206367 And it's incredibly funny to me<br />and I love that
7206450 7208869 she's trying to build a case<br />through the video camera.
7208952 7214083 She's trying to build a new diary, a new<br />entry into her diary of victimization.
7214291 7219129 And so, she has to mess up his hair<br />and untuck his shirt and get him to bleed.
7219213 7222049 And she does this and then, of course,<br />she offers up,
7222132 7223634 "That's how the kids are wearing it."
7223717 7226553 <i>And he has no idea<br />what she's talking about,</i>
7226637 7231350 but she sends him on his way<br />and it's sort of naughty and sexy
7231433 7234895 and promises something else in the future.
7235979 7239566 The extent to which<br />he does not truly understand.
7239650 7244988 This was something we came up with,<br />not on the day, but close to it.
7245072 7247324 I said, "What if there's<br />beet juice lying around
7247408 7249785 "and she literally<br />spills beet juice on herself,
7249868 7252663 "so it looks like she's hemorrhaging?”
7252746 7256417 And Rosamund ran with it.
7260212 7264091 And I think this is when people<br />begin to truly fear Amy.
7264675 7265968 Let's hope.
7268345 7269346 (WHIMPERING)
7276937 7278147 (INAUDIBLE)
7279440 7280774 (KEYS JANGLING)
7282860 7286697 Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.
7289867 7293996 FINCHER: So, in the escalation of the mob,
7294079 7299126 in the fomenting<br />of the unrest of the locusts.
7299209 7302713 This is the peak<br />of where we were headed lo.
7302796 7306842 We didn't ask the extras to be
7306925 7310471 particularly vociferous or horrible,
7310554 7312306 we just added all that stuff in,
7312389 7315642 but it was really, really important<br />in the loop groups
7315726 7318353 to get something goes from being,
7318437 7321106 "Hey, hey, can we take your picture?" to
7321190 7324151 "Was she pregnant?<br />Hey, stop, where are you running to?"
7324234 7328322 At this point, they were just about<br />ready to flip this vehicle over
7328405 7331408 and kill everybody inside.
7333076 7334703 She's air.
7336747 7339708 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7346507 7351720 FINCHER: I thought it was a great idea<br />to show her torturing her wrists
7351803 7354431 so that you really see how<br />she could have these ligature marks
7354515 7355516 and that they would be believable.
7355599 7358894 And we know from the scene with Scoot<br />that she knows what she's doing
7358977 7361438 as it relates to a ligature. Um...
7362439 7365651 And then we decided<br />to take it a little bit further.
7376954 7380749 So, everybody bitches and moans<br />about how many takes...
7380832 7384878 People I've never even met complain<br />about how many takes I shoot.
7384962 7389049 The take of Neil Patrick Harris<br />parking that Jaguar
7389132 7393178 dead center in the middle of that frame,<br />that was take two.
7393679 7395847 That was take two, it's in the movie.
7395931 7398308 We walked away after take two.
7399601 7401228 So please,
7401812 7403313 go fuck yourselves.
7403855 7405482 I've been thinking...
7405941 7407359 I don't wanna be without you.
7407442 7411321 FINCHER: This was designed to play in one<br />because I really wanted to see
7411405 7417578 the palpable tension in the change
7418036 7420664 from who Amy has been
7420747 7425711 to this new voracious,<br />sort of sexualized, um...
7426670 7432968 There's always been the promise of Amy<br />as his partner in lust.
7433468 7436013 And now, all of a sudden it had to be<br />something that...
7436096 7438181 She has to get him going really fast.
7438265 7440851 She wants to end it as quickly as possible.
7440934 7442811 And so, when we blocked this scene,
7442894 7446398 we were talking about it for a,<br />sort of, maximum, um...
7446690 7447733 But I want it.
7447816 7451612 FINCHER: It's not about two people<br />enjoying each other.
7451695 7454448 It's about one person<br />getting their needs met,
7454531 7458827 while another person<br />has to get half their needs met.
7458910 7460996 And it was a...
7462080 7466627 It was a particularly<br />complex scene to shoot.
7466710 7470714 Not so much for the activity,<br />but for the cleanup.
7470797 7474343 And we shot for two days.
7474760 7481725 We had 36 changes of wardrobe.
7482434 7488231 36 changes of bedding. 36 pillows. 36...
7489566 7493111 The reason why is<br />obviously that it's messy.
7493612 7498450 And the idea of somebody<br />being slaughtered like a lamb
7498533 7501411 in the middle of coitus was, uh...
7502037 7504456 It was dirty work,<br />but somebody had to do it.
7509211 7511129 -(PANTING)<br />-(DESI GURGLING)
7520764 7524601 I loved her little shake of the head<br />and not wanting to
7524685 7527145 get blood on her nose.
7528021 7530774 I love the fact that she's so prudent about
7530857 7533777 getting too much blood on her,<br />or messing her hair.
7535237 7540409 It's one of those little things that really<br />makes her a memorable screen villain.
7545956 7547708 The day that we shot this sequence,
7547791 7552671 I think was the day that the cast... Well,<br />at least the day that Ben and Rosamund
7552754 7555632 finally realized that they were<br />dealing with somebody
7555716 7558343 who was a little unhinged. Um...
7558844 7562097 We blocked this whole scene,<br />we brought in the crane,
7562180 7564057 we had all the extras there.
7564141 7570772 We took about an hour-and-a-half to get<br />the continuity of the blood on Rosamund
7570856 7574943 and that it could flake off and<br />look like she'd been bloody all night.
7575026 7577320 And she showed up on the set<br />and I said, "Okay,"
7577404 7579865 and then she comes forward<br />and she falls into your arms.
7579948 7582659 And then, I didn't want the poster for<br />Gone with the Wind.
7582743 7587456 I wanted her to fall after you say,<br />"You fucking bitch.”
7587539 7593587 She falls away from you and gives<br />the press the photo of their careers.
7593670 7595255 It's literally...
7595338 7599760 It has to be People magazine<br />fodder for the next 15 years.
7600177 7603430 And it was the moment where<br />we had the crane set up
7603513 7607100 and we were ready on the 21mm lens<br />to be in the over-the-shoulder,
7607184 7609394 and she drops,<br />and we see everybody go crazy,
7609478 7611438 and then the camera shoots up into the air.
7611521 7615108 And when I showed that to Ben and<br />Rosamund, that's when they were like,
7615192 7618111 "What is this movie?" (LAUGHING)
7618195 7620864 "What is going on?"
7620947 7624951 It was a very enjoyable moment<br />because I think that they finally realized
7625035 7629623 how unhinged the third act<br />of this movie was gonna be.
7630540 7633210 It was definitely one of those moments<br />where you thought,
7633293 7635921 "If I show you this footage,
7636004 7638632 "you will understand exactly<br />what's going on in my head,”
7638715 7642886 and I brought them over and I showed them<br />the thing and they looked at me like,
7642969 7644971 "Okay.
7645055 7646681 "How does this fit in?"
7646765 7648934 I thought I was explaining myself so well.
7649768 7651394 Answer his letters.
7651645 7653647 Keep him calm.
7655065 7656525 Oh, my God.
7657150 7658652 Oh, I've encouraged him.
7658819 7660612 You can't blame yourself.
7662239 7664407 He pushed inside.
7665992 7668036 And he grabbed me.
7668745 7671832 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.
7672165 7673875 And he clubbed me.
7674334 7675627 I collapsed.
7675794 7679714 That club was actually the handle<br />to a Punch and Judy puppet.
7679881 7681299 Right.
7682217 7683635 Treasure hunt.
7685554 7687472 I'd hidden some puppets at Go's--
7687639 7689349 Then how did Desi have that handle?
7691226 7693144 I'd just found it.
7693895 7696314 It must have fallen off.
7696565 7697566 I...
7698233 7701778 I was holding it when Desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7701945 7703029 About that woodshed...
7703196 7704865 He took me to his lake house.
7705448 7707033 Tied me to his bed.
7707200 7709619 Back to the woodshed real quick.<br />Real quick.
7709786 7711496 When you went to place the puppets there...
7711663 7712914 did you notice that it was packed--
7713081 7714124 Lots of stuff.
7714291 7718587 Corresponding to purchases made<br />on credit cards in your husband's name.
7718753 7720130 AMY: Nick and credit cards.
7720297 7722716 He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.
7722883 7725677 He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.<br />They're very close.
7726219 7730432 Now, may I go back<br />to where I was being held prisoner...
7730599 7733226 by a man with a history<br />of mental problems?
7733393 7734436 Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
7738773 7740859 Desi assaulted me that night.
7741818 7743653 Every night.
7744154 7747574 FINCHER: One of my favorite little moments<br />in the movie is when Rosamund
7747657 7753663 starts to tell the story of her abuse<br />at the hands of Desi to the FBI.
7754247 7756249 And she gets fo...
7756333 7758251 Shave me.
7758543 7760420 FINCHER: She gets to, "Shaved me."
7760503 7763590 (LAUGHING) And everybody in the room<br />looks like
7763673 7766593 it's the most uncomfortable<br />thing that they've ever heard.
7766676 7770931 And obviously, the FBI has<br />probably heard worse,
7771014 7774184 but I love the idea of<br />everyone's palpable discomfort
7774267 7776144 at the idea of being shaved.
7776227 7778855 It's so (INHALES SHARPLY)<br />pornographic.
7779230 7781274 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7782609 7784986 FINCHER: And here is Patrick Fugit killing it
7785070 7789741 <i>with his little reassessment of Ben Affleck,<br />when he's like,</i>
7791326 7794037 "You know, I never liked you<br />and this is the reason why I don't like you.
7794120 7798041 "Can't you just be happy when everything<br />turns out okay, and your wife comes back?"
7798124 7801378 And he's like, (WHISTLES)<br />“Dude, you just don't get it."
7804339 7806299 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7806466 7808176 If I could just clarify one thing--
7810470 7812889 FINCHER: And this is another<br />little moment that I love
7812973 7816393 when she looks over<br />out the window and she says,
7816810 7818645 I love him."
7818728 7821898 And Ben, who has no idea<br />what's being said in the room
7821982 7826987 looks and sees her looking at him,<br />fries to be supportive or appear supportive.
7827070 7828363 And he waves.
7828446 7831366 And this wave is priceless.
7835328 7837747 And that's when Boney realizes
7839833 7842335 this is beyond her understanding.
7842502 7843753 Amy Dunne is home.
7843920 7845880 Now, I know there are<br />a lot of questions and concerns...
7846047 7847924 but for right now, we wanna sit tight...
7848091 7852220 and just be thankful and grateful<br />for this miracle on the Mississippi.
7852303 7855015 FINCHER: When Tyler got ready to say<br />“miracle on the Mississippi,”
7855098 7858435 I was tempted to push him toward...
7858518 7862814 A little toward Johnnie Cochran there,<br />but he was absolutely right.
7862897 7865150 He came up with a perfect sort of,
7865233 7869154 you could definitely trademark it, but it<br />doesn't look like we're pandering.
7872657 7874784 This was a lot of fun,<br />shooting this sequence,
7874868 7877704 when we mounted the camera<br />to the outside of the car
7877787 7879497 and we drove up that street.
7879581 7882459 And I saw the look on Rosamund's face
7882542 7887297 and her eyes flitting from<br />one adoring fan to the next.
7887380 7889382 It was fantastic, it was like you just went,
7889466 7891051 "This is gonna work.
7891134 7893845 "Well, the drive up<br />to the house is gonna work."
7906816 7908068 (CROWD APPLAUDING)
7909152 7911905 And this is one of my favorite cuts,
7911988 7915158 they go inside the house<br />which looks like a doll's house
7915241 7917786 and he shuts the door, and he has nothing
7917869 7920997 but contempt<br />for the people that they've just fooled.
7921748 7923416 I'm not pretending.
7924125 7925835 You were perfect.
7926711 7928922 FINCHER: And the moment where<br />Rosamund has to think
7929005 7931049 for a second before she says,
7932133 7933843 "Take off your clothes.”
7933927 7937138 And then she's perfectly honest.
7937222 7940058 "I need to make sure<br />you're not wearing a wire."
7943561 7944813 Take off your clothes.
7945313 7947857 I need to make sure<br />you're not wearing a wire.
7947941 7950652 FINCHER: It seems like the most<br />reasonable request. And yet... (LAUGHING)
7961830 7963373 You killed someone, Amy.
7963456 7967127 FINCHER: So, this is<br />one of those things that's like...
7967210 7970088 The whole reason that this scene<br />takes place is in a shower
7970171 7973383 IS soO that the character, Nick Dunne,
7973466 7977178 can't be recorded saying any of these lines
7977262 7981766 and that none of the things<br />that Amy will say to Nick Dunne
7981850 7984894 could be recorded by any outside parties.
7984978 7988273 Which, of course, means the entire<br />scene has to be looped
7988356 7992944 because, indeed, being in the shower yields
7993027 7996156 dialogue tracks that are wholly unsuitable.
7996239 8001077 I feel like the looping on this is<br />some of the best looping that...
8001161 8003329 I feel like the performances of it are
8003413 8006124 as good or better than anything<br />that they gave on the day.
8006207 8011296 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8011880 8013506 Once they go...
8014174 8015175 I go.
8015341 8017135 FINCHER: That's my favorite shot<br />of Rosamund ever
8017218 8018469 when she says, "Sleep on it."
8018553 8023892 It's like you see she is strong,<br />she is stunning and she is nuts.
8035612 8037197 Was there ever a baby?
8037488 8039574 There can be.
8043620 8046706 FINCHER: This music,<br />the dissonant background
8046789 8050251 that's about to take over this theme,
8050335 8052962 this lush synthesizer theme<br />that's about to go away
8053046 8056424 with the backing-up beeping of this truck.
8056507 8063348 And then it's gonna get into<br />this crescendo hum of anxiety.
8063806 8067769 And it's one of my favorite cuts<br />as we go from the locked door
8067852 8070438 fo the man with his cat.
8071147 8073691 And you really get the idea,
8075151 8077737 "He really does not know<br />where this is going.”
8091751 8092752 (SIGHS)
8097674 8099342 MAN: Hey, Nick!
8101386 8105556 FINCHER: It's a subtle thing and it may be<br />stupid, but I do like the idea that,
8105640 8110019 then the very next morning<br />she's co-opted his cat.
8110103 8111229 Turncoat.
8111312 8112563 Hello, handsome.
8116276 8119779 FINCHER: And then this innocuous, cute,
8119862 8126160 squeaky-clean picture of prom goers<br />is turned over to headline news.
8126244 8129831 It's split down the middle<br />like a Sherry Lansing poster
8129914 8131708 and spattered with blood.
8133084 8134419 You must be so proud.
8136546 8139799 FINCHER: This is something that<br />Ben came up with on the day.
8139882 8142844 The newscaster in the background is a local
8142927 8145805 newscaster in Cape Girardeau,<br />who is amazing,
8145888 8150768 came out and did so many, take after take.<br />She's in like 15 different scenes.
8151185 8154772 And on this day,<br />she had to ask Ben the question,
8154856 8157567 "What's the plan, Nick? Where are you..."
8157650 8162613 And Ben added this line<br />in the walkover, where he said,
8162697 8166784 “It's been four hours."<br />And I thought it was so funny.
8166868 8171205 And the focus puller<br />never got back with the focus
8172957 8175168 to the news anchor in the background.
8175251 8180006 So after everything,<br />after her one line, it was like,
8180089 8183634 the one that's in the movie<br />is the one that we blew.
8184594 8187722 I swear, you two are<br />the most fucked-up people I've ever known.
8187889 8189349 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8189599 8191309 You and Amy under the same roof?
8191476 8193269 You should pitch that as reality television.
8195521 8197190 FINCHER: Originally there were two scenes,
8197273 8201027 there was a scene that took place<br />at the diner where Tanner Bolt leaves,
8201110 8206199 and then there was a scene at the bar<br />where Boney lets everybody know
8206282 8208409 that there's nothing more she can do.
8208493 8210661 And so we decided to compress<br />them into one scene
8210745 8212663 and put it at the airport in St. Louis.
8213956 8216709 I like this scene.<br />I like Tyler's line reading of,
8216793 8219754 (LAUGHING)<br />"I specialize in fucked-up people.”
8220463 8223341 Funny's funny.
8223424 8224759 Truth is funny.
8227428 8228471 You may wanna thank her.
8231516 8232934 Just don't piss her off.
8233476 8234519 See you, guys.
8236896 8238439 Elvis has left Missouri.
8238606 8239565 She had to have made a mistake.
8239649 8242235 FINCHER: When Kim Dickens says,<br />"We had the national spotlight on us
8242318 8244278 "and we stained the rug,” it's...
8244362 8247073 We had the national spotlight on us,<br />we stained the rug.
8247281 8250785 FINCHER: She's able to be so plain<br />and so simple about it,
8250868 8255123 and it reads as, "It's sad but it's also...
8255873 8257625 “It's the way things are.”
8257708 8261379 And I love the pathos of that.
8262672 8265049 And that's when you've really got<br />somebody who's skilled,
8265133 8268302 because they can do it with<br />no inflection and no spin
8268386 8273015 and they just gotta come clean,<br />and that's what makes her great.
8275017 8277228 This is a scene, on the day<br />when we were shooting this,
8277311 8281315 I could not stop laughing,<br />'cause the idea of him
8281399 8284735 being trapped in his own home by
8286028 8287488 Mrs. Danvers.
8287572 8288656 Couldn't sleep.
8288823 8289824 Come on...
8290116 8292285 let me tuck you back in.
8303629 8305882 FINCHER: Watch Ben's hands here,
8305965 8309260 he will not bring them down until he can't...
8309343 8312472 He just can't get over<br />the situation that he's in.
8312555 8315475 He's forgotten how to behave normally.
8318686 8321022 I do need you to participate, though.
8321606 8324525 FINCHER: I don't know where this idea<br />of the villainous chin came in,
8324609 8328196 but we teased Ben mercilessly<br />during the making of the movie
8328279 8329697 that he said yes to this movie
8329780 8333493 and then immediately got on the phone<br />to his agent and said,
8333576 8337163 "Okay, I'm doing a villainous chin role.<br />You have to find me a heroic chin role,”
8337246 8339790 and that's how Batman came about.
8339874 8343794 She is a calculating,<br />murderous psychopath.
8344420 8345838 And I have been complicit--
8346005 8347131 AMY: Nick!
8348799 8351219 FINCHER: So, there were a lot of people<br />who took issue with the fact that
8351302 8355890 there are these different stages of ending<br />the movie.
8355973 8360269 I mean, if we had stopped the movie<br />at the point of time that Amy comes back,
8360353 8363523 or stopped the movie at the shower,
8363606 8365691 or stopped the movie when he tucked her in
8365775 8368861 and was sitting there petting his cat.<br />I'm not so sure...
8368945 8373241 I feel like I need the dressing room scene<br />which is coming up.
8373324 8376244 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8376410 8378120 "Fantastic" is a little flippant.
8378538 8379539 "Amazing"?
8379705 8382416 I need you to admit<br />that you got the credit cards...
8382583 8385586 and that you hid all that stuff at Go's<br />and that you pushed me.
8386337 8389382 I'm gonna need those three things<br />to feel safe.
8390591 8392426 You have to own this, Nick.
8393219 8396764 -Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.<br />-(DOORBELL RINGS)
8398516 8401727 FINCHER: So this is the only time<br />that you see Missi
8401811 8405690 outside the box of a television,<br />and she's priceless.
8405773 8410820 I think that this moment<br />where she steps in it with both feet...
8412071 8416784 He's so reasonable in the way<br />that he's presenting this to her, which is,
8416867 8420288 "Why would I ever be nice to you<br />after everything that you've done?"
8420371 8424542 And she's like, "Don't you get it?<br />It's not about you, it's about perception.”
8424625 8429171 And then she goes to bring out<br />the robot cat for his robot dog.
8433593 8435261 To go with your robot dog.
8435428 8436637 I'll go find Amy.
8436721 8438806 FINCHER: And I love the dryness of that.
8439515 8441100 She's downstairs.
8441183 8442476 FINCHER: This is a scene that we
8442560 8444979 Frankensteined from<br />two or three other scenes
8445062 8448649 that were written for this moment.
8448733 8452236 And we were rehearsing on the day,
8452320 8455823 and we sent the crew out<br />as we tried to figure out
8455906 8457742 what the thesis scene was gonna be.
8457825 8460828 We needed a scene where he gets trapped,
8461287 8465833 but that they also have a discussion<br />about what all this is.
8465916 8467627 What it all means.
8469462 8474300 So Ben grabbed Rosamund,<br />and he goes, "I would just say...
8474383 8477470 "I would call her a cunt.<br />I don't know any other way.”
8477553 8479347 And I said, "Okay."
8479430 8482808 "So, you would do that?"<br />And everybody got, "Oh, no, no. You can't.
8482892 8485603 "You cannot use that word.<br />You cannot use that word."
8485686 8489649 And I said, "Well, what if<br />Rosamund takes the word back?
8489732 8492860 "What if she says, 'Yeah, okay. Fine,<br />if that's what we're gonna...
8492943 8495988 "That word has no power over me.<br />Let me tell you what.
8496072 8499659 "If that's how little you think of me,<br />that you would use that word.
8499742 8504330 "Let me tell you,<br />let me remind you that this is who I am.
8504413 8508751 “I'm that person, yes.<br />But if you look at your life,
8508834 8511962 <i>"'you were never more alive<br />and never better</i>
8512046 8516676 "than when you were trying to be<br />somebody that this person would like.""
8517385 8522306 And then it pushes him<br />into this kind of honesty
8522390 8526394 where he says, "Why do you want it?<br />What is it about this that you even want?"
8526477 8528354 And he rattled that off.
8528437 8531774 Ben, when he gets on a roll,<br />he can get angry and he can get...
8531857 8536904 And he went on this roll about,<br />"Yes, we loved each other, but why?
8536987 8539073 <i>"Look what's happened<br />and look where we are now.</i>
8539156 8541701 "And look what it is.”
8541784 8544954 And Rosamund just said,<br />"Well, that's marriage.”
8545037 8549792 And I thought, "Maybe not that reading,<br />but that's a pretty powerful idea."
8549875 8552420 That that's what it's all about.
8552503 8557383 That it is about knowing your limitations
8557466 8559427 and knowing the things<br />that you're attracted to,
8559510 8561637 and knowing that they're unhealthy to you,
8562471 8566016 and knowing that they don't<br />necessarily lead to the most, um...
8566100 8568519 I just thought it was kind of...
8568728 8572565 It certainly illuminated for me<br />what this relationship was about.
8572648 8579029 And why it was as poisonous<br />and dramatic as it had become.
8579113 8581615 It's not about what I want anymore.
8581782 8583033 You wanna stay with her.
8583367 8587204 FINCHER: And I love that Carrie Coon<br />is always gonna be there for him.
8587288 8589749 I think that Margo is...
8589832 8593794 She's the conscience of the movie.<br />She's the conscience of the audience.
8593878 8594879 You're breaking my heart.
8595171 8598674 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8598841 8601218 I need you with me on this.
8601385 8603846 Of course I'm with you.
8606474 8610478 I was with you before we were even born.
8612229 8615024 NICK: We've been through the darkness.
8615566 8618861 We've come out, united.
8619195 8621489 FINCHER: I love the moment<br />in this interview
8621572 8625493 where he is about to spill the beans.
8625576 8631040 And he says, "Partners in crime,”<br />and then he just can't do it.
8632291 8634794 We're partners in crime.
8638005 8639006 And?
8640382 8643260 FINCHER: And she owns him.<br />In that moment she owns him.
8643344 8648516 And then it becomes<br />this hug between girl friends
8648891 8651477 and he is done.
8651560 8653354 -Oh, how exciting!<br />-Thank you.
8658150 8660528 NICK: "What are you thinking?"
8663364 8665574 "How are you feeling?"”
8667535 8670162 "What have we done to each other?"
8671747 8673833 "What will we do?"
