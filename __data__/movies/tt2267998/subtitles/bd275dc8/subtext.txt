23273 24313 When I think of my wife...
26693 29203 I always think of her head.
30655 33592 I picture cracking<br />her lovely skull...
33616 35886 Unspooling her brains...
35910 38540 Trying to get answers.
39748 43269 The primal questions<br />of any marriage.
43293 45646 "What are you thinking?"
45670 47940 "How are you feeling?"
47964 50594 "What have we done<br />to each other?"
145562 149572 The Irish prince graces<br />us with his presence.
151234 154364 His majesty prefers<br />not to be moistened.
155572 156862 I got you a present.
158450 159927 - I hated this game.<br />- You loved it.
159951 161262 You loved it.
161286 163576 Thank you. I'll add<br />it to the collection.
164372 166542 Can you pour me a bourbon?
172797 174877 What's up, jitters?
178595 180948 Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm<br />gonna have to fill the silence...
180972 184368 With another excruciating<br />story by Margo Dunne.
184392 187079 I could tell you about my recent<br />customer service experience...
187103 189123 - Changing Internet service providers.<br />- I like that one.
189147 192043 Or how about the time I saw that woman who<br />looked exactly like my friend Monica?
192067 194003 But it wasn't Monica.<br />It was a total stranger.
194027 195947 Who was also named Monica.
196404 198124 - Made it kind of interesting.<br />- It's great.
198740 200092 I'm just having a bad day.
200116 202094 - Amy?<br />- It's our anniversary.
202118 204096 - Five years.<br />- Five?
204120 205306 That came fast.
205330 206660 And furious.
211211 214301 I'm so crazy, stupid happy.
217133 218611 I met a boy.
218635 223065 A great, sweet,<br />gorgeous, cool-ass guy.
225308 226619 Excuse me, miss?
226643 228120 I just want you to be careful...
228144 230956 Where you put down that<br />monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
230980 233709 Because the party's down to three<br />beast lights and a bottle of pucker.
233733 235461 It might attract some<br />desperate characters.
235485 238325 It could. I mean, the Amish<br />are on a rumspringa.
242409 244970 They already relieved me of<br />my artisanal meat platter.
244994 247890 Finally, someone tells me<br />how to pronounce that word.
247914 248914 "Meat"?
248915 250165 Yes, "meat." One syllable.
250500 253187 Thank you. Whose beer<br />am I about to drink?
253211 254501 Don't tell me.
255171 256841 Let's see, who's your type?
257257 258359 I don't see you<br />sitting quietly...
258383 261988 While he bloviates on his<br />postgrad thesis about proust.
262012 264323 Uh-oh. Is that him?
264347 266628 Ironic hipster, so self-aware,<br />he makes everything a joke.
266850 269850 I prefer men who are<br />funny, not "funny."
271688 273040 What type are you?
273064 274542 Corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth<br />Missouri guy.
274566 275710 Missouri?
275734 276669 Cute.
276693 279046 - Native new yorker?<br />- The world ends at the Hudson.
279070 280172 What's your name?
280196 281196 Amy.
281197 283527 Well, Amy, who are you?
284868 288055 A, I'm an award-winning<br />scrimshander.
288079 292268 B, I'm a moderately<br />influential warlord.
292292 295422 C, I write personality<br />quizzes for magazines.
295795 300026 Okay. Your hands are far too<br />delicate for real scrimshaw work...
300050 303321 And I happen to be a charter subscriber<br />to middling warlord weekly...
303345 304555 So I'd recognize you.
304888 306240 I'm gonna go with "c."
306264 307684 And you?
308516 310077 Who are you?
310101 314441 I'm the guy to save you<br />from all this awesomeness.
318526 321380 So, you write for<br />a men's magazine.
321404 324675 God, does that make you<br />an expert on being a man?
324699 325779 No.
326576 327897 It's you know what to wear,<br />what to drink.
327911 329889 How to bullshit.
329913 331515 Never with you.
331539 332391 Ha, ha.
332415 334060 No, I mean it.
334084 335895 It's hard to believe you.
335919 336729 Why?
336753 338397 I think it's your chin.
338421 339565 My chin?
339589 342276 Yeah, it's quite villainous.
342300 343930 Okay, how's this?
344928 348098 A hundred percent<br />true, no bullshit.
348473 349473 Okay.
349474 351077 We all move to New York...
351101 355247 And we end up living in these little<br />cubby holes, and that's not it.
355271 358731 Come outside. Then,<br />you're in it.
361152 362902 You have to see this.
371454 372556 Hey.
372580 373580 Hey.
382549 384318 I have to kiss you now.
384342 385778 Is that right?
385802 388972 I can't let you go through<br />a sugar storm unkissed.
390807 391967 Wait a second.
394686 396146 There you go.
408074 409494 Nick Dunne...
411244 413334 I really like you.
419502 421752 So, is Amy gonna do one<br />of those anniversary...
422714 424025 Treasure hunts?
424049 426068 You mean the forced march<br />designed to prove...
426092 429071 What an oblivious and uncaring<br />asshole her husband is?
429095 430175 Wow.
433016 434744 Life. I don't<br />remember the point.
434768 436996 Deep hasbro thoughts.
437020 438350 Spin.
439189 441417 What was the clue last<br />year she got so mad about?
441441 444754 "When your poor Amy<br />has a cold..."
444778 446505 "This dessert just<br />must be sold."
446529 447529 The answer?
447530 449342 I still don't know<br />the answer, go.
449366 451552 - A few years ago, you'd have known.<br />- A few years ago, it was fun.
451576 453262 Year one, the traditional<br />gift was paper.
453286 456766 She got me a beautiful notebook.<br />Told me to go write my novel.
456790 457683 What did you get her?
457707 459101 A kite.
459125 460955 - She'd never flown a kite.<br />- Okay.
461920 464523 Anyway. Year four, flowers.
464547 467797 She led me outside to the dying<br />rosebush in the backyard.
468134 469195 That's symbolic.
469219 470219 Yeah.
470220 471697 What's the gift for five?
471721 472531 Wood.
472555 475034 - So, what did you get her?<br />- There's no good gift for wood.
475058 478412 I know! Go home, fuck her brains<br />out, slap her with your penis.
478436 479896 "There's some wood<br />for you, bitch."
483441 484731 The bar.
485485 487922 Why, yes. Hang on one second.
487946 489106 Hey, it's watchful Wally.
491408 493408 Hey, Walt. What's going on?
495787 498867 Thanks very much. I'll be right there.<br />All right, bye-bye.
511094 513764 Hey, buddy. What are<br />you doing out here?
514973 516473 Thanks, Walt!
532157 533527 Ame?
553887 555347 Amy!
568026 569026 Hello?
569194 570654 Come on in.
571214 572214 Hey.
572238 573674 - Mister Dunne.<br />- Hi.
573698 576218 I'm detective Rhonda Boney.<br />This is officer James gilpin.
576242 578220 We understand there are<br />concerns about your wife.
578244 582164 I don't know where my wife is.<br />And I came home to this.
583208 585998 Now, I don't panic easily...
586336 588416 But it's weird, right?
589673 590673 Mind if we look around?
590859 591859 Please.
591883 593163 How long have you two been here?
593176 596030 Two years in September.<br />We used to live in New York.
596054 597156 City?
597180 600326 Yeah, I was a writer.<br />We were both writers.
600350 601994 Why did you all move back here?
602018 603663 My mom got sick.
603687 606666 Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?
606690 608167 She's dead.
608191 609191 I'm so sorry.
614906 617196 What do you do now, for work?
618076 619906 My sister Margo and I<br />own the bar downtown.
620370 622223 Oh, the bar.
622247 624517 Love the name. Very meta.
624541 625631 Thanks.
628586 630376 Pretty things.
635135 636487 Stay.
636511 638261 My office, here.
641307 643347 Beautiful dress.
647165 648165 Date night?
648189 649439 It's our anniversary.
652610 654110 It's a guest bedroom, there.
654404 656048 Cat's room on the end.
656072 657622 I checked up here.
661995 663097 This is the kitchen...
663121 664461 Obviously.
680221 682074 This is my wife's office.
682098 683718 Amy's office.
696780 699842 Wow. Impressive gal.
699866 701093 Yeah. Should I be concerned?
701117 702287 I remember these.
703536 704786 I loved these books.
708958 710394 Wait a minute.
710418 712418 Your wife is amazing Amy?
713004 715358 Yeah. She is.
715382 717012 Wow.
720011 723658 Amazing-fucking-Amy is<br />getting fucking married.
723682 725493 That's how the night started.
725517 731624 With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br />jealous, as always, of the golden child.
731648 736238 Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,<br />who's getting fucking married.
736569 738381 When I was 10, I quit cello.
738405 741995 In the next book, amazing<br />Amy became a prodigy.
744452 745471 Did you play volleyball?
745495 747390 I got cut, freshman year.
747414 749334 She made varsity.
750750 752770 When did you have a dog?
752794 753794 She got the dog.
754421 756941 Puddles made her more relatable.
756965 758317 Wow.
758341 760486 I love your parents...
760510 762321 But they really can be assholes.
762345 763823 - Nick!<br />- Sir!
763847 765658 Hey, thanks for coming, man.
765682 766492 No problem.
766516 767926 Hey, sweetheart.
768518 769954 Big night for your mom.
769978 773833 It would mean so much if you<br />would talk to a few reporters...
773857 775751 Bloggers, give them<br />a little Amy color.
775775 777670 People wanna hear from you.
777694 779338 - We can't stay long.<br />- Fantastic.
779362 781532 Fifteen minutes, tops.
781865 786178 This is why I have my brownstone.<br />My trust fund. I know I can't complain.
786202 788848 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
788872 792935 No, they improved upon it, and<br />then peddled it to the masses.
792959 795187 I thought you were gonna wear<br />white to match the wedding theme.
795211 796689 I thought that would be creepy.
796713 799191 "If it's worth doing,<br />it's worth doing..."
799215 801569 hold up! I know how this ends.<br />Don't tell me.
801593 803404 You're very cute, Nick.
803428 805072 Amy, you know what would<br />make dad's night.
805096 806716 I'm on it.
808016 811037 I love having strangers<br />pick at my scabs.
811061 812330 I'm curious whether...
812354 814064 It's difficult for you to see<br />amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
814689 817543 And this big party celebrating<br />this fictional wedding.
817567 819920 Because it's my understanding<br />you are not married.
819944 821614 Is that correct?
822572 826344 Correct. Amazing Amy has always<br />been one step ahead of me.
826368 830198 Excuse me. I'm sorry, I<br />just have a few questions.
830515 831515 It's you.
831539 834079 I'm here in a strictly<br />journalistic capacity.
834376 837730 Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br />of dating Nick Dunne for how long?
837754 840566 - Two magical years.<br />- Two magical years.
840590 842443 In the course of that time,<br />you've had the opportunity...
842467 844945 To perform such<br />gracious gestures as...
844969 848908 Not correcting Nick when he<br />pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
848932 850409 An understandable mistake.
850433 851633 He also thought it was a fish.
851643 853233 He thinks velveeta is a cheese.
854270 856582 You also manage to appear<br />shocked and delighted...
856606 859210 When Nick's elderly mother breaks<br />into an impromptu rendition...
859234 861462 Of New York, New York,<br />every time she sees you.
861486 863547 These bag of bone shoes
863571 864757 that's just frightening.
864781 867426 You also bought Nick his<br />very first pair of scissors.
867450 869136 And matching stapler.
869160 872098 Amy Elliott, you are<br />more than amazing.
872122 875643 You are brilliant, yet<br />entirely un-snobby.
875667 879313 You challenge me.<br />You surprise me.
879337 880667 And, fun fact for the readers...
881089 882799 You have a world-class vagina.
885593 887933 Now my colleagues tell me that<br />you are not yet married.
888471 890282 Is that correct?
890306 891784 I'm not.
891808 893138 Isn't it time we fixed that?
894602 896288 And then...
896312 899152 The night wasn't so bad anymore.
915498 918019 And it's done. Crossed<br />off the list.
918043 922023 Now, normally, we would not treat this<br />as a missing persons case so quick...
922047 923487 But given the scene<br />at your house...
923506 925651 And given our spike in<br />violent crime of late...
925675 928154 We are gonna take this<br />very, very seriously.
928178 929178 Okay. Good.
929179 932491 We've got forensics over at your place.<br />You got somewhere to stay?
932515 934118 - I could stay at my sister's.<br />- Okay.
934142 936454 We're tracking Amy's<br />phone, her credit cards.
936478 938164 We will organize<br />searches, put up flyers.
938188 939833 We're gonna hold a press<br />conference tomorrow.
939857 941208 You're having a<br />press conference?
941232 942835 I wanna get the word out, right?
942859 947149 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel<br />like I'm on a law & order episode.
955205 957391 Time is of the essence<br />in these cases.
957415 960186 But, that said, do you wanna<br />wait and call a lawyer?
960210 961354 Absolutely not. I<br />just wanna help.
961378 963189 So, you and Amy have<br />been here two years.
963213 966484 - You tend bar...<br />- I own the bar.
966508 970029 And I teach creative<br />writing at mvcc.
970053 971864 - No kids?<br />- Not yet.
971888 973366 So, what does Amy do most days?
973390 975600 A woman with all those<br />degrees, what does she do?
976101 977536 I don't know. She keeps busy.
977560 979060 Doing what?
981272 982917 She's a voracious reader.
982941 985781 So, she's always got<br />a book in her hand.
986861 988339 Well, days can get long.
988363 992218 I know a few housewives, that evening<br />glass of wine starts coming at noon.
992242 993552 Or prescription pills.
993576 995096 Just last week, we<br />had a soccer mom.
995120 997598 Nice lady. Got her teeth<br />kicked in over some oxycontin.
997622 999725 Ever since that mall went bust,<br />half the town is out of work.
999749 1001268 We cannot keep up with<br />the drug violence.
1001292 1003729 I'm pretty sure that's not it.
1003753 1005593 Has Amy got friends<br />we can talk to?
1007590 1008901 No, not really.
1008925 1010903 No friends?<br />This whole town?
1010927 1014573 She was very close with my<br />mom, before she passed away.
1014597 1016742 You know, we have a pretty<br />serious homeless problem...
1016766 1017886 In our neighborhood.
1018226 1019986 I think maybe you guys<br />should check that out.
1021271 1022289 We'll look into that.
1022313 1024959 You got to the bar<br />around 11: 00 today.
1024983 1026585 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that out.
1026609 1027609 Well, I was home.
1027610 1030256 I left at 9: 30, I got a cup<br />of coffee, a newspaper.
1030280 1031924 I went to Sawyer Beach<br />and read the news.
1031948 1034135 Did you visit with anyone there?
1034159 1036119 I kind of go to Sawyer<br />beach for the solitude.
1037287 1039890 So, your wife has<br />no friends here.
1039914 1041767 Is she kinda standoffish?
1041791 1044228 Ivy league? Rubs<br />people the wrong way?
1044252 1045752 She's from New York.
1046921 1050276 She's complicated. She's<br />got very high standards.
1050300 1051300 Type a?
1051468 1054071 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1054095 1056949 You seem pretty laid-back.<br />Type b.
1056973 1059143 Speaking of which,<br />Amy's blood type?
1059684 1061495 God, I don't know. I'd have<br />to look it up at the house.
1061519 1064332 You don't know if she has friends, you<br />don't know what she does all day...
1064356 1066292 And you don't know your<br />wife's blood type.
1066316 1067436 Sure you all are married?
1069194 1070194 Maybe it's type o.
1070195 1072423 - Where are her folks? New York?<br />- Yeah.
1072447 1074175 Can they get here time for this<br />press conference tomorrow?
1074199 1076260 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1076284 1078137 You haven't called your<br />wife's parents yet?
1078161 1080598 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1080622 1083100 Call them, please, Nick. Now.
1083124 1084334 Fine.
1089839 1091817 Should I know my<br />wife's blood type?
1091841 1092841 No.
1093176 1096989 I apologize, Marybeth. I<br />didn't know what was going on.
1097013 1098532 Now I'm at the station...
1098556 1102056 And the cops are at the house, and<br />it's serious and I'm calling you.
1102769 1105748 There's a lot of things that<br />are being juggled right now.
1105772 1109043 I'm standing right next to<br />detective Rhonda Boney...
1109067 1111027 Who's the lead investigator<br />on this and she's...
1113279 1115449 My mother-in-law would<br />like to speak with you.
1116866 1118177 This is detective Boney.
1118201 1119553 I wanna go home.
1119577 1122056 I don't know why I<br />have to be here.
1122080 1124725 I don't wanna be here.<br />I wanna go home.
1124749 1125879 Dad?
1126292 1127895 This is my father.<br />What's going on?
1127919 1128959 Really?<br />You're Nick Dunne?
1129212 1131232 We've been trying to get a<br />hold of you all afternoon.
1131256 1132942 I've been right there.<br />My wife is missing.
1132966 1134110 - Bitch.<br />- Don't.
1134134 1136529 Your father wandered out of<br />Comfort Hill after lunch.
1136553 1138948 We found him walking<br />route 79, disoriented.
1138972 1140449 We've been trying to<br />call you for the last...
1140473 1141742 I don't get a cell<br />signal in this building.
1141766 1143726 I've been sitting 20<br />feet away from you.
1144060 1145705 Sir, please don't take<br />that tone with me.
1145729 1146872 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.
1146896 1148436 Dad, stop.
1151109 1152319 You wanna drive him home?
1152986 1155276 I think that would be wise.<br />Thanks.
1174841 1177931 This voice mailbox<br />is currently full.
1178845 1179845 Fuck.
1181973 1184577 Get your fucking hands off me.
1184601 1185981 Thanks.
1198782 1202970 Everyone told us and<br />told us and told us...
1202994 1205598 Marriage is hard work.
1205622 1208684 And compromise and more work.
1208708 1210978 "Abandon all hope,<br />ye who enter."
1211002 1213939 "When young Amy's<br />hope did wane..."
1213963 1215316 "She wandered here..."
1215340 1217860 Well, it's not true.<br />Not for me and Nick.
1217884 1220529 "...In search of Jane."
1220553 1223473 With us, two years...
1223723 1225143 It's just good.
1225642 1227482 Austen.
1228978 1232978 You were an alienated teen and only<br />Elizabeth Bennet understood you.
1233483 1235483 Look at that.
1237320 1238700 My God.
1239197 1240508 You naughty minx.
1240532 1243636 Well, technically, we are supposed<br />to fuck at the next stop.
1243660 1245304 Yeah, in keeping with tradition.
1245328 1248849 But I might be willing to<br />bend the rules this once.
1248873 1250583 God bless Jane Austen.
1265932 1269942 I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br />It's confirmed by the...
1272897 1275187 Thank you.
1276234 1277694 Year two. Cotton.
1284451 1288723 We had that joke that our sex<br />was too good for ordinary.
1288747 1291207 So, these are 2,000<br />thread-count...
1296254 1299191 we're so cute.<br />I wanna punch us in the face.
1299215 1302425 That's pretty great.<br />I mean, that is pretty great.
1303887 1305364 Did they ask if you<br />wanted a lawyer?
1305388 1307558 I don't need a lawyer.<br />Here, I'll do this.
1308058 1310036 Well, did they ask<br />personal stuff about Amy?
1310060 1311230 You know, they asked...
1311561 1313039 Why didn't she have any friends?
1313063 1313914 What did you say?
1313938 1315938 - I said she was complicated.<br />- Nick!
1316941 1319571 Everyone knows "complicated"<br />is code for "bitch."
1324991 1326802 God. I feel sick.
1326826 1328236 Thanks.
1329245 1330556 It's so bizarre.
1330580 1333100 It seems like the kind of thing<br />that would happen to Amy.
1333124 1334310 She always attracts...
1334334 1335924 drama?
1336753 1338147 You can say it. It's<br />just me and you.
1338171 1340733 Just because I don't<br />like to be around Amy...
1340757 1342197 Doesn't mean I don't<br />care about her.
1345095 1347265 Anyway, whoever took her is<br />bound to bring her back.
1356606 1358668 Detective?<br />Excuse me.
1358692 1361322 I'm Noelle hawthorne.<br />I'm Amy's best friend.
1362445 1365105 Well, great. Where<br />do you live, Noelle?
1365657 1367176 Five doors down. 1032.
1367200 1369428 Wonderful.<br />I would love to talk to you.
1369452 1371347 Can I come by in half an hour?
1371371 1373099 - Y'all know anything yet?<br />- I'm sorry.
1373123 1375935 I got guys on the clock in here.<br />But you give me 30 minutes.
1375959 1377289 But that's usually bath time.
1378044 1380634 Well, we'll talk in<br />between shampoos.
1383383 1384694 All right. So, what do you got?
1384718 1387348 It was definitely blood spatter<br />you saw in the kitchen.
1387846 1389532 Normally, kitchen,<br />knives, food prep.
1389556 1391951 Not that weird, but<br />that is awfully high.
1391975 1393619 So, I'm gonna order<br />a luminol sweep.
1393643 1394813 Well, okay.
1397522 1398624 Interesting.
1398648 1399792 What's that?
1399816 1403337 House is rented in her name.<br />Car's in her name.
1403361 1406507 Credit cards, utilities,<br />phone bill, all in her name.
1406531 1408384 Even his bar's in her name.
1408408 1410344 I don't know that<br />that's so surprising.
1410368 1412013 No. But it is humiliating.
1412037 1412972 What you got?
1412996 1415826 It's with her unmentionables.
1428178 1431058 Well, we have our first clue.
1442150 1443836 I have to take a shower.
1443860 1445671 No, don't. You've<br />been up all night.
1445695 1447855 You wanna look like<br />you've been up all night.
1449491 1451844 Hey, be careful today, okay?
1451868 1453220 That's a weird thing to say.
1453244 1457016 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.<br />You can seem angry, like...
1457040 1458559 please don't say, "like dad."
1458583 1461354 Or else you swing into your momma's-boy<br />charm offensive and that can feel glib.
1461378 1462188 Perfect.
1462212 1464982 I'll balance on the exact fucking<br />edge of your emotional razor.
1465006 1466859 Okay. Just be...
1466883 1468819 Myself?
1468843 1471197 Sponsoring a raffle to<br />benefit west county 4h...
1471221 1474700 And raffling season tickets<br />for mizzou football.
1474724 1478024 Buy your tickets at the wing hut<br />or local tri-state tire stores.
1482607 1483937 Your in-laws made it.
1485944 1487004 - Hi, Rand.<br />- Hey, man.
1487028 1487880 I'm detective Boney.
1487904 1489882 I'm the twin. Margo.
1489906 1493010 We played tennis yesterday, Nick.<br />I just can't get over it.
1493034 1494387 Marybeth, I am really sorry.
1494411 1496222 I knew you never should<br />have moved back here.
1496246 1497390 We didn't have a lot of choice.
1497414 1501102 We are all worried.<br />We are all scared.
1501126 1505586 But we are all here now. And<br />we will find Amy, together.
1515807 1517743 Should I just go first, and then<br />you guys can say something?
1517767 1518767 Good.
1520395 1524750 As you know, my wife,<br />Amy Elliott Dunne...
1524774 1527574 Disappeared from our home on<br />the morning of July 5th...
1528528 1531090 Under suspicious circumstances.
1531114 1532591 Louder!
1532615 1537054 If anyone out there has<br />any information...
1537078 1539432 Please come forward.
1539456 1541076 Thank you.
1543418 1546272 I'm Rand Elliott.<br />My wife, Marybeth Elliott.
1546296 1547377 Should I have said my name?
1547964 1549942 Amy is our only child.
1549966 1553966 She's bright, she's beautiful.<br />She's kind.
1554471 1555971 She really is amazing Amy.
1556306 1559035 You know, there are millions<br />of people out there...
1559059 1561620 Who grew up with her<br />and care about her.
1561644 1564274 We care about her, we love her.
1564981 1567571 And we just want her back.
1569486 1572131 Amy is a decorated scholar.
1572155 1575134 She forged a successful<br />career in journalism.
1575158 1577470 She returned here to her<br />husband's hometown...
1577494 1579834 And she made a life<br />in her adopted home.
1580914 1583309 Now, Amy needs your help.
1583333 1587480 We're establishing a volunteer<br />headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
1587504 1592844 We have a hotline,<br />1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.
1593093 1598513 And our website is<br />www.findamazingamy.com.
1599015 1600975 - Mr. Dunne!<br />- Mr. Elliott!
1602352 1604192 Mr. Dunne, any signs<br />of foul play?
1605939 1609609 Mr. Elliott, when was the last<br />time you spoke to your daughter?
1611111 1612111 Smile.
1618702 1620292 That's all for now. Thank you.
1622872 1625726 Amy is the kind of girl<br />who attracts admirers.
1625750 1626644 Right, Nick?
1626668 1627853 Yeah, definitely.
1627877 1630398 And we've had instances...
1630422 1632483 - Where things got...<br />- Scary.
1632507 1633985 Do you know about Desi Collings?
1634009 1635695 Yeah, I know all<br />about Desi Collings.
1635719 1636988 He was obsessed.
1637012 1640366 He attempted suicide after Amy<br />broke up with him sophomore year.
1640390 1641951 We had to file a<br />restraining order.
1641975 1644370 This would be high school?<br />Twenty years ago?
1644394 1647623 But he recently moved to St. Louis.<br />That's just two hours away.
1647647 1649542 To be fair, he is from St. Louis.
1649566 1651210 We also have Tommy O'Hara.
1651234 1653462 This is only eight years<br />ago, in New York.
1653486 1655798 She broke up with him,<br />he got very physical.
1655822 1657508 - She filed charges.<br />- What was the charge?
1657532 1659635 Sexual assault, threat,<br />battery, what?
1659659 1661637 I only know it was bad.
1661661 1663472 - I didn't know this.<br />- Okay.
1663496 1665433 Thank you.
1665457 1666747 Anything more recent?
1670086 1672086 Not that I know of.
1674549 1677469 Hey, Nick?<br />You got a minute?
1678636 1680256 Yeah.
1685643 1687038 Imagine our confusion.
1687062 1688247 A missing persons case...
1688271 1690875 And in your wife's dressing room,<br />we find an envelope marked "clue."
1690899 1693169 That's for our anniversary.
1693193 1695504 My wife does these<br />treasure hunts.
1695528 1697923 I'm hoping you can tell<br />me what this means.
1697947 1698947 You want to solve<br />Amy's treasure hunt?
1699366 1701686 It'll help me track Amy's<br />movements before she disappeared.
1701910 1704096 Of course. Okay.
1704120 1706710 "Although this spot<br />couldn't be tighter..."
1707457 1710167 "It's a cozy room for<br />my favorite writer."
1713004 1714214 I know this one!
1714714 1718224 Although this spot<br />couldn't be any tighter...
1718843 1721643 It's a cozy room for<br />my favorite writer.
1723139 1726577 After-school meeting,<br />don't mind if I do.
1726601 1729521 Maybe I'll teach you<br />a thing or two.
1733566 1735920 Well, well. What does it say?
1735944 1737454 Clue two.
1738571 1741951 "Hey, handsome man,<br />let's go undercover."
1742450 1746330 "You'll be the spy, and<br />I'll be his lover."
1746830 1747890 "Let's head on over..."
1747914 1749809 "To the little brown house."
1749833 1753543 "We'll play hot, doting<br />husband, sweet, loving spouse."
1756589 1757589 These yours?
1758216 1759235 No.
1759259 1760736 But you read the first clue.
1760760 1763906 Randy Professor,<br />naughty student.
1763930 1764991 I blush.
1765015 1766775 Me and my ex just swapped cards.
1767976 1769370 Where's this little brown house?
1769394 1770904 I have no idea.
1814105 1815475 Hello?
1816149 1818029 Nicholas Dunne.
1818693 1821783 Under my father's<br />name, William Dunne.
1828203 1832308 My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?<br />Can you just turn the bell...
1832332 1833332 yeah, I know.
1833333 1834963 It's... it's...
1837420 1839710 It's "puddles," right?<br />Or is it "poodles?"
1843635 1845265 We're good.
1846846 1847990 Hello, stranger.
1848014 1850159 Fancy meeting you here.
1850183 1852495 It's your dad's house, right?
1852519 1854163 Are you following me?
1854187 1855081 What you doing?
1855105 1857291 Like you said, it's<br />my dad's house.
1857315 1860025 I come by once a week, make sure<br />the place hasn't burned down.
1861820 1863110 But it looks okay.
1863863 1865743 I'll walk you out.
1868993 1870513 You know...
1870537 1873808 I thought maybe this was<br />the little brown house.
1873832 1875059 From the clue.
1875083 1877043 Nope. Still blue.
1893518 1897748 Picture me, I'm a girl<br />who's very, very bad.
1897772 1901482 I need to be punished, and<br />by "punished," I mean "had."
1901985 1905115 It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.
1905405 1909165 "So open the door,<br />and look alive."
1910452 1911492 Bitch!
1915206 1918206 Want to test your<br />marriage for weak spots?
1918877 1920337 Add one recession...
1920670 1921960 Subtract two jobs.
1922547 1924692 It's surprisingly effective.
1924716 1927153 Promise me we'll<br />never be like them.
1927177 1928321 Like who?
1928345 1930114 All those awful couples we know.
1930138 1934118 Those wives who treat their<br />men like dancing monkeys...
1934142 1935602 To be trained and paraded.
1936227 1938937 Husbands who treat their wives<br />like the highway patrol...
1939314 1941904 To be out-foxed and avoided.
1946654 1948324 I think I'm gonna be laid off.
1949115 1951927 We're in a recession. If it<br />happens, we'll deal with it.
1951951 1954180 I'll probably be next.
1954204 1955454 We have each other.
1955830 1958370 Everything else is<br />background noise.
1959459 1961249 You are exceptional.
1968968 1970218 My turn.
1972097 1975576 My parents' publisher dropped them,<br />and they're in debt up to their ears.
1975600 1976452 That's terrible.
1976476 1978913 And they need to borrow<br />from my trust fund.
1978937 1980456 How much?
1980480 1982690 Almost a million.
1983274 1984877 That's almost all of it.
1984901 1987213 This is where you say, "everything<br />else is background noise."
1987237 1988277 Amy, if you're laid off...
1988446 1989715 And I'm laid off...
1989739 1990883 I said I'd do it.
1990907 1992176 Without talking to me?
1992200 1993803 - Well, it's...<br />- Your call.
1993827 1995407 Their money, technically.
1999833 2001503 You know what?<br />You're right.
2002127 2004127 Everything else is<br />just background noise.
2013096 2014096 Hey.
2018226 2019412 More games?
2019436 2021056 Yeah, I just wanted<br />to shoot some folks.
2022272 2023732 What's the laptop for?
2024816 2025816 Laptop-ing.
2028005 2029005 I see.
2029029 2032029 You can give your parents<br />$879,000 without talking to me...
2032574 2035219 But God forbid I buy a video game<br />without getting your permission.
2035243 2036303 You are spending a lot.
2036327 2038597 You don't trust me. You<br />don't trust my judgment.
2038621 2040182 You certainly don't<br />trust my intention.
2040206 2041183 What are you talking about?
2041207 2042852 That's the basic tenet<br />of a prenup, isn't it?
2042876 2045146 Why are you throwing<br />that in my face again?
2045170 2046731 Because it's easy to throw.
2046755 2047565 Nick, I don't get it.
2047589 2050943 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2050967 2054071 The nagging shrew. The<br />controlling bitch.
2054095 2056490 I'm not that person.<br />I'm your wife.
2056514 2057700 I'm sorry.
2057724 2060077 I just don't know how to do this.<br />I've never not had a job.
2060101 2062121 I flipped burgers,<br />I painted houses.
2062145 2064155 You'll get another job.
2068568 2069778 Hi, go.
2071529 2073299 What?<br />Hold on. What?
2073323 2074759 - And suddenly...<br />- Slow down, what is it?
2074783 2076802 I knew everything was<br />about to get worse.
2076826 2078406 Okay, tell me what's wrong.
2105772 2107272 - Bless you, Nick.<br />- Father.
2107941 2109377 Hey, Tom. Mayor!
2109401 2110670 Nick, good to see you.
2110694 2111712 Good to see you.
2111736 2112986 Hey, guys, hey.
2115407 2116907 - Jodie.<br />- Nick.
2118618 2120238 Oh, we'll find her.
2135218 2136946 You look like hammered shit.
2136970 2138640 Thank you.
2146730 2148450 You ever see that guy<br />in the glasses before?
2149107 2151877 Don't worry. We videotape everybody<br />that comes in and out of these things.
2151901 2153713 I mean, you tend<br />to get a lot of...
2153737 2154797 Do-gooders?
2154821 2156048 Freaks.
2156072 2158050 Hey, I meant to ask you.
2158074 2159534 Noelle Hawthorne?
2160410 2162130 She lives on your street.<br />Amy's best friend.
2163246 2164598 I've never heard the<br />name Noelle Hawthorne.
2164622 2166809 She and her husband<br />have triplets.
2166833 2167833 Oh.
2168126 2170956 Yeah, we might say hi<br />to them on the street.
2171338 2173508 But "best friend"? No.
2174049 2175259 Excuse me, one sec.
2179554 2181657 He acted like Noelle was<br />a complete stranger.
2181681 2182771 Of course he did.
2183141 2184452 Look, these two are yours.
2184476 2186871 Oh, look. He's being<br />a good guy...
2186895 2188831 So everybody can see<br />him being a good guy.
2188855 2190666 You really don't<br />like him, do you?
2190690 2192190 What's to like?
2213880 2217526 This mailbox is currently full.<br />Press one to...
2217550 2220930 Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.<br />My name's Shawna Kelly.
2221179 2223908 I am so sorry for your troubles.
2223932 2224867 Thank you. That's kind.
2224891 2226327 Are you remembering to eat?
2226351 2227495 Well, a lot of cold cuts.
2227519 2231707 I'm gonna fix you up my<br />world-famous chicken frito pie.
2231731 2233251 That's very kind and<br />very unnecessary.
2233274 2234904 You have to keep your strength.
2235443 2236443 Would you...
2237320 2239200 Say, "chicken frito pie!"
2243410 2244700 You know what?
2245954 2247348 Would you delete<br />that picture for me?
2247372 2249266 - It's a nice photo.<br />- I know it is.
2249290 2250726 But just do me a favor.
2250750 2252520 Will you?
2252544 2255481 Would you go ahead and<br />please delete that picture?
2255505 2256524 You just press...
2256548 2258067 What is wrong with you?
2258091 2259402 Could you please not<br />share that with anyone?
2259426 2262756 I will share it with<br />whomever I please.
2266558 2267952 - Dude.<br />- Yeah?
2267976 2269306 Marybeth is pissed.
2270020 2271020 Why?
2273690 2275292 Marybeth?
2275316 2278736 It's like you're the<br />goddamn homecoming king.
2281156 2283634 It was important to my<br />mother that I be polite...
2283658 2285594 I be considerate,<br />I be a gentleman.
2285618 2287346 It looked like you<br />were having fun.
2287370 2289620 I am in a nightmare!
2290331 2292768 All I'm trying to<br />do is be nice...
2292792 2296502 To the people who are<br />volunteering to help find Amy.
2298465 2300225 You're right.
2301092 2303052 And I'm sorry.
2305055 2308685 My God, this place literally<br />smells like feces.
2319652 2323007 In your searches, did you find<br />any golf clubs, real fancy?
2323031 2324451 No.
2325575 2327303 How about a brand<br />new stratocaster?
2327327 2328447 No, nothing like that.
2329162 2331252 Well, all right.
2336252 2339315 How big's that TV?<br />It's not 65-inch.
2339339 2340650 No, it's nowhere near that.
2340674 2341764 Okay.
2342217 2343653 - Kibble?<br />- Excuse me?
2343677 2345780 He asked me to feed his cat.
2345804 2347014 I saw some in the pantry.
2347347 2352119 Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?<br />Noelle Hawthorne!
2352143 2353746 I know y'all are in there!
2353770 2358270 Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne<br />and her children back out to the street?
2359150 2361253 Detective Boney!
2361277 2365107 Just remind her it is a<br />possible crime scene.
2373832 2378672 Look at that pie-eating grin,<br />from a guy whose wife is missing.
2384467 2386047 - How are you doing?<br />- Terrific.
2387804 2389323 How's Marybeth?
2389347 2391200 She's a wreck.
2391224 2392684 And you?
2393309 2394954 Awesome.
2394978 2395978 Hey...
2395979 2397559 Have you told me everything?
2397814 2398814 Of course.
2398815 2399815 Everything?
2399816 2401002 Why would you even ask me that?
2401026 2405196 Ever since you walked into the bar that<br />morning Amy went missing, you seem...
2406489 2407489 - Off.<br />- I am off.
2408533 2411887 Everybody's examining me and<br />projecting their shit on me.
2411911 2415349 All I want is to come over<br />here, have a beer with you...
2415373 2416726 And not be judged.
2416750 2418250 Can we do that?
2419336 2420666 Of course.
2422047 2424066 You know what I keep thinking?
2424090 2425151 If mom were here?
2425175 2428595 Yeah. Like I'm 12.
2430055 2432855 Nick, mom would fix it.
2440065 2443285 I'm gonna go Benadryl<br />myself to sleep.
2446196 2448526 - Love you.<br />- Love you.
2452869 2454930 So, here's a strange,<br />new sentence.
2454954 2458424 I am a missourian.
2465215 2466595 Bye, dad.
2468510 2471989 No money, no jobs, no prospects.
2472013 2474200 And then, we heard from go.
2474224 2476160 Mama Maureen...
2476184 2479024 Stage 4 breast cancer.
2481189 2484043 So, we moved to Missouri.
2484067 2485711 I don't mind.
2485735 2488905 I just wish he'd asked.
2500583 2503062 Nick is happy to be home.
2503086 2505586 But I don't know if he's<br />happy I'm with him.
2507090 2510361 I feel like something<br />he loaded by mistake.
2510385 2513572 Something to be<br />jettisoned, if necessary.
2513596 2515806 Something disposable.
2517642 2520272 I feel like I could disappear.
2564272 2566292 Oh, my God!
2566316 2568294 - I saw you on TV.<br />- Okay.
2568318 2570004 - It's so crazy.<br />- Yeah, I know.
2570028 2572256 - She just vanished?<br />- She's just gone.
2572280 2574133 - I've been so worried about you.<br />- Where have you been?
2574157 2576010 I called you a hundred times.<br />You gotta pick up your phone!
2576034 2577094 Rehearsals.
2577118 2578179 What?
2578203 2579503 Godspell.
2581331 2582933 My sister's asleep<br />in the other room.
2582957 2584101 I needed to see you.
2584125 2585811 I know this is a bad idea.
2585835 2587355 Can you at least<br />tell me you love me?
2587379 2591150 I do love you, but we have to<br />be really careful right now.
2591174 2592443 I've been so scared.
2592467 2593694 Between rehearsals?
2593718 2595488 You told me I needed<br />to have my own life.
2595512 2597031 I know.
2597055 2598324 We need to stop.
2598348 2599518 I need you.
2600642 2602482 Touch me.
2605897 2608517 Stop it. Come here.
2609901 2611629 Sit down.
2611653 2613005 Okay.
2613029 2617134 Did you, by any chance, tell<br />anybody anything about us?
2617158 2618678 Even in texting, or on Facebook.
2618702 2621514 Facebook?<br />I use the disposable phone.
2621538 2623474 You buy my presents in cash.<br />I'm not stupid, Nick.
2623498 2626394 I know, sweetie. Did you leave a<br />pair of red panties in my office?
2626418 2629855 I don't know. Maybe.<br />They better be mine.
2629879 2630879 Sweetheart, think.
2630880 2633359 I don't know. I'd have to<br />check my red panty inventory.
2633383 2636028 Andie, I need you to take<br />this seriously, okay?
2636052 2637863 This is the last time we're<br />gonna see each other, until...
2637887 2639347 Until when?
2639889 2641367 Until it's safe.
2641391 2642994 You were going to get a divorce.
2643018 2645204 Never say that out loud again.
2645228 2647898 Okay. I'm sorry.
2648773 2649773 I don't wanna fight.
2651776 2653379 I just wanna be with you.
2653403 2654573 Andie, please...
2655405 2657075 That's all I want.
2658408 2659488 I can't.
2661828 2664098 It's our last time together.
2664122 2666172 Let's make the most of it.
2672922 2676262 Real quick, but then<br />you have to go.
2679095 2681907 My husband has come undone.
2681931 2684910 We moved to Missouri<br />to save Maureen...
2684934 2687654 But as it turns<br />out, we couldn't.
2690940 2692690 It means a lot that you came.
2693860 2695254 We took a hit on<br />the brownstone...
2695278 2697608 And I used the last of my<br />trust fund to buy him a bar.
2698365 2700625 So far, it's just costing money.
2704829 2708619 Nick uses me for<br />sex when he wants.
2711795 2714305 Otherwise, I don't exist.
2715548 2717652 We should go to outback tonight.
2717676 2718944 That would be nice.
2718968 2722048 Last night, I went from<br />desperate to pathetic.
2722972 2726160 I became someone I<br />don't even like.
2726184 2727984 The kind of woman<br />I used to mock.
2728395 2730122 You're out so much.
2730146 2732500 - I know.<br />- Stay home.
2732524 2734877 - I can't, I'm already late.<br />- Then, can I come?
2734901 2736712 You would hate it.
2736736 2739986 It's a bunch of my dorky<br />high school friends.
2740990 2743870 Do our code. No bullshit.
2744327 2746697 I thought we weren't<br />gonna be that couple.
2753211 2755051 Okay, bye.
2756715 2759694 - Hey, I've been thinking.<br />- Yeah?
2759718 2761088 Something positive.
2762512 2763552 Maybe it's time.
2764848 2766701 Now is literally the worst time.
2766725 2767965 It would be a new start for us.
2768184 2770913 And for me, I would have<br />a real purpose here.
2770937 2772164 A child is not a hobby.
2772188 2773188 Not a hobby.
2774190 2775400 An inspiration.
2775942 2779088 We could have had this fight<br />four hours ago. I'm late.
2779112 2780381 I didn't know it was<br />gonna be a fight.
2780405 2783843 You really wanna be the couple that<br />has a baby to save their marriage?
2783867 2784867 "Save"?
2785368 2787555 Reboot, retool,<br />rekindle, whatever!
2787579 2789765 - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br />- Yeah!
2789789 2792351 You're a fucking coward.
2792375 2794270 No, it can't go on like this.
2794294 2795354 Really?
2795378 2796897 - I won't.<br />- You won't?
2796921 2799275 You won't? Why, it's not<br />good enough for you?
2799299 2800234 It's not even close!
2800258 2802388 You stupid bitch!
2802969 2805948 What scared me wasn't<br />that he'd pushed me.
2805972 2809812 What scared me was how much<br />he wanted to hurt me more.
2810143 2812233 What scared me was that<br />I'd finally realized...
2813229 2816899 I am frightened of<br />my own husband.
2828787 2830306 You want me to call for backup?
2830330 2832420 Nah, I'll protect you.
2840173 2841593 Jesus.
2846638 2849308 They ought to burn<br />this place down.
2849766 2851426 Seems like folks are trying.
2856940 2859251 You really think<br />this is anything?
2859275 2861435 Cross it off the list.
2872539 2874266 Hey, Jason.
2874290 2875851 What's up, Rhonda?
2875875 2878125 "...and dedicated to the<br />proposition that all men..."
2879212 2881712 - Have you seen this girl around here?<br />- Why do you ask?
2881965 2883805 She was reported missing.
2886970 2888864 "...and so dedicated,<br />can long endure."
2888888 2890825 Yeah. I remember her.
2890849 2892979 What did she want?<br />Weed, pills?
2894644 2895654 She wanted a gun.
2895895 2897957 I told her it's not my thing.
2897981 2901002 I felt bad, though. She<br />seemed really desperate.
2901026 2904630 She said it needed to be small,<br />so she could keep it close.
2904654 2906507 Are you sure this is her?
2906531 2908661 You don't forget a girl<br />like that in here.
2909659 2911178 She was all in pink.
2911202 2913752 It was Valentine's day.
2916708 2919478 For Valentine's day, I<br />thought I'd buy a gun.
2919502 2922092 That is how crazy I've become.
2923173 2927320 Nick wants me gone but he<br />won't ask for a divorce.
2927344 2931490 In his mind, I'm the owner of his<br />bar, his only line of credit.
2931514 2933024 The bitch with the prenup.
2934851 2937204 I could go home to my parents...
2937228 2939665 But I'd have to tell<br />them the truth.
2939689 2943544 And I don't even know<br />if I believe the truth.
2943568 2946358 Can I really think<br />Nick would hurt me?
2946988 2949368 I'm being paranoid. Crazy.
2950700 2951700 It's just...
2952660 2955200 I'd sleep better with a gun.
2966091 2967526 Oh, shit.
2967550 2971180 Wake up, baby. My sister's<br />gonna come out here.
2975558 2977768 - Sorry to rush you.<br />- It's okay.
2979729 2981248 - Here. Let me help you.<br />- Okay.
2981272 2983362 Just get that.
2986027 2987527 Be very careful.
2988363 2989382 I'm all right.
2989406 2992009 Here you go.
2992033 2993928 Promise me we'll talk every day.
2993952 2995221 Okay, we will.
2995245 2997965 Every day, Nick,<br />or I'll go crazy.
2998748 2999850 Don't go crazy.
2999874 3001134 Okay.
3005547 3008901 You fucking idiot.
3008925 3012755 You fucking asshole! You fucking<br />lied to my fucking face!
3014264 3015814 I'm sorry.
3017600 3018600 How old is she?
3018935 3020135 She's in her early 20s.
3021062 3022062 How long?
3022605 3025418 - A year and a half.<br />- You lied to me for over a year?
3025442 3027128 If I told you, you would<br />have made me stop.
3027152 3028754 It's so fucking small.
3028778 3031757 You're a liar and a cheat!<br />You're just like dad!
3031781 3033092 How did you even meet her?
3033116 3034326 She's one of my students.
3035577 3037263 I thought writers hated clichés.
3037287 3038139 I'm not a writer.
3038163 3040433 "Boo-hoo, I got laid off. I<br />guess I'll fuck a teenager."
3040457 3043269 It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br />no idea how shitty it was with Amy...
3043293 3045229 How fucking terrible<br />she made me feel.
3045253 3048441 Flyover boy.<br />I would get knots in my stomach...
3048465 3050318 Just coming home, knowing she<br />would be sitting there...
3050342 3052503 Dissatisfied, before I even<br />walked in the fucking door.
3052510 3053946 This is so bad.
3053970 3056073 If anybody finds out,<br />you're totally fucked.
3056097 3058743 Boney found a pair of<br />panties in my office...
3058767 3060307 Where, occasionally,<br />Andie and I...
3060769 3061912 I don't know what<br />the fuck it means.
3061936 3063122 Are they super-twat's?
3063146 3065249 Her name is Andie.
3065273 3066792 She's not entirely sure.
3066816 3068502 So we are dealing<br />with a 20-year-old...
3068526 3069962 Who isn't sure where<br />she leaves her undies?
3069986 3072256 If they're not Andie's, that<br />means that they're Amy's...
3072280 3074008 And she left them<br />there for me to find.
3074032 3077803 Nick, I was scared for you before,<br />and now, I'm fucking petrified.
3077827 3080139 We're having a vigil tonight<br />for your missing wife...
3080163 3083309 And this morning, you're kissing<br />your college girlfriend goodbye!
3083333 3084503 Can you imagine?
3085126 3088481 Have you watched<br />television lately?
3088505 3091515 Cable news is all<br />over your shit.
3092133 3093986 I mean, what is wrong<br />with this barkeep?
3094010 3096322 His wife's nowhere<br />to be found...
3096346 3100034 And here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.<br />Cute pic, huh?
3100058 3102536 - Who is that?<br />- Some fucking tragedy groupie.
3102560 3104497 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- I don't know.
3104521 3105665 She was trying to<br />give me a casserole.
3105689 3108834 On the show today we have defense<br />attorney, Tanner Bolt...
3108858 3111398 Patron Saint to<br />wife-killers everywhere.
3111695 3115216 Tanner Bolt, would you actually<br />consider defending Nick Dunne?
3115240 3116384 Well, let me just say...
3116408 3119178 As always, Ellen, thank you<br />for such a warm welcome.
3119202 3120752 But of course, I'd<br />defend Nick Dunne.
3121037 3123557 Listen, just because this guy<br />isn't walking around weeping...
3123581 3125017 That doesn't mean that<br />he's not hurting.
3125041 3128396 Tanner, the hallmark of a<br />sociopath is a lack of empathy.
3128420 3130380 But the truth is, you'd<br />have to be a sociopath...
3130880 3132692 To behave normally<br />in this situation...
3132716 3135486 Because it's the most abnormal<br />situation in the world.
3135510 3138197 Tanner, are you trying to<br />tell me that this photo...
3138221 3140491 Is remotely in the realm<br />of acceptable behavior?
3140515 3143175 I'm so sick of being<br />picked apart by women.
3144561 3146441 You need to hire Tanner Bolt.
3148333 3149333 I don't deserve this.
3149357 3151252 Innocent until proven guilty.
3151276 3153671 That's exactly what you deserve.
3153695 3155245 Go home, Nick.
3181222 3182642 Hey, buddy.
3198531 3200343 I can't believe we haven't<br />arrested this guy.
3200367 3202345 We're not gonna<br />arrest anybody...
3202369 3203930 Just because some<br />blonde dunce says so.
3204287 3206787 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3207082 3210436 One, I am conducting an<br />investigation, not a witch-hunt.
3210460 3212396 And, two, don't talk<br />to me that way, ever.
3212420 3213731 She was trying to buy a gun.
3213755 3215941 We don't know who or what<br />was scaring her, Gil.
3215965 3216965 Give me the update.
3217467 3220112 No drug angles panned out yet,<br />so cross that off the list.
3220136 3222114 I talked to the nurses who<br />care for Nick's father.
3222138 3224867 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as<br />a kitten, so cross that off the list.
3224891 3226077 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3226101 3229538 So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br />like the 4th of July.
3229562 3230873 - Whoa.<br />- Yeah.
3230897 3232041 The blood is profuse.
3232065 3234293 It is Amy's, type b, and<br />we should have DNA soon.
3234317 3235419 Thoughts on a weapon?
3235443 3237380 Trajectory indicates<br />blunt force.
3237404 3239744 Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
3240323 3243594 She fell there, but I<br />doubt she got back up.
3243618 3245054 Amy's medical records come in?
3245078 3247078 No, we'll have them<br />later tonight.
3248665 3250085 My wife says he's a killer.
3250333 3252673 Well, if Tiffany says...
3278278 3279278 Hey.
3279612 3280612 Hey.
3285035 3286195 Thank you all for coming out.
3287871 3289515 Hey Donnie, how are you?
3289539 3292879 Rich, thank you so much.
3300175 3301185 Hey.
3308224 3311829 Thank you, folks. Thank you<br />for being here tonight.
3311853 3313653 It just means the<br />world to our family.
3314189 3315649 And to Amy.
3316232 3318232 As you all know...
3319069 3322381 My wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...
3322405 3323905 Disappeared three days ago.
3324491 3328054 And I want to implore anyone who<br />has any information at all...
3328078 3331015 Please come forward. Help us.
3331039 3331974 So hot.
3331998 3333392 He is so creepy.
3333416 3336896 I wanna say something, because I think<br />some of you might be wondering...
3336920 3338840 And are too polite to ask.
3339339 3342429 I had nothing to do with the<br />disappearance of my wife.
3343009 3344987 I'm cooperating with the police.
3345011 3347073 I haven't hired a lawyer.
3347097 3348217 I have nothing to hide.
3349516 3352016 Amy is my soul mate.
3352268 3353558 She is brilliant...
3354104 3357194 She's charming, and wise.
3357524 3359234 I love you, Amy.
3363363 3364453 Asshole.
3365782 3367702 I love my wife...
3368076 3369286 So much.
3371788 3376128 And I may not behave for the<br />cameras the way they want me to...
3376543 3379772 And if they wanna punish<br />me for that, that's okay.
3379796 3383526 But I just wanna ask you in the<br />media, please, harass me...
3383550 3386612 But don't harass the<br />people of this town.
3386636 3388698 If you need to mock<br />somebody, mock me.
3388722 3389949 Nick!
3389973 3392134 But please don't turn this<br />investigation into a circus.
3392142 3393744 Where's your wife, Nick?
3393768 3395268 Let the police do their jobs.
3395729 3397309 What did you do to<br />your pregnant wife?
3399149 3400418 Did you tell them that, Nick?
3400442 3402492 Did you tell them Amy<br />was six weeks pregnant?
3406239 3408409 Thank you for your support tonight.<br />Let's find Amy.
3410577 3412217 Go ahead, if you guys<br />wanna say something.
3416291 3417671 Gil, go, go.
3420003 3421147 Nick, where are you going?
3421171 3422773 Stop him!
3422797 3425007 No questions right now.<br />Thank you.
3427510 3429050 Why are you running away?
3430138 3431558 Don't run.
3432640 3433640 Everybody, stay back.
3438438 3440624 Guys, come on. You know better.
3440648 3443127 Get off the grass, get<br />down to the curb.
3443151 3444587 - Hey, Gil...<br />- On it.
3444611 3445671 All right.
3445695 3447506 All right, y'all heard her.<br />No pictures.
3447530 3448820 Hello?
3449574 3451135 Hello?
3451159 3452011 Fuck.
3452035 3453554 You scared me. Want a drink?
3453578 3455097 Did you know she was pregnant?
3455121 3457266 I told you, Noelle Hawthorne<br />is fucking crazy.
3457290 3458330 She doesn't even know Amy.
3459000 3460601 They look like pretty<br />good friends to me.
3468176 3471614 Look, I don't know. But it certainly<br />doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
3471638 3472865 We have her medical<br />records coming.
3472889 3474784 - Good.<br />- So, let's talk while we wait.
3474808 3477036 Let's start over here.<br />The scene of the crime.
3477060 3479955 You see, we've seen<br />dozens of home invasions.
3479979 3481957 Dozens and dozens.
3481981 3484210 This area right here, it looked<br />wrong from the second we saw it.
3484234 3487404 The whole thing looked staged.<br />I mean watch this.
3489322 3492742 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3493159 3494929 I don't know. What do<br />you want me to say?
3494953 3496597 Did you do any housekeeping the<br />day your wife went missing?
3496621 3497621 No.
3497622 3499892 Because our guys did<br />a luminol test.
3499916 3502603 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3502627 3504897 Amy lost a lot of blood<br />in there, Nick. A lot.
3504921 3505921 Oh, my God.
3505922 3507274 Yeah, and then<br />somebody mopped it up.
3507298 3509777 Wait a second. Why would<br />they mop up the blood...
3509801 3511404 If they're trying to<br />stage a crime scene?
3511428 3514198 No blood and no body<br />suggests kidnapping.
3514222 3516659 It tells us, look at<br />people outside the house.
3516683 3518119 Like these homeless<br />you keep mentioning.
3518143 3521247 A pool of blood and no<br />body suggests homicide.
3521271 3523290 It tells us to look at<br />people inside the house.
3523314 3526043 - Which is what we're doing here, Nick.<br />- I see.
3526067 3529046 So, how was your marriage, Nick? Because<br />right now, all we got is Noelle.
3529070 3530631 She says, "not good."
3530655 3532174 Hey Gil, what do you and<br />your wife argue about?
3532198 3534343 - What pisses you off?<br />- Money, lack thereof.
3534367 3536137 Me and my ex, it's the same.
3536161 3539515 I mention that because we got a<br />look at your finances, Nick.
3539539 3542268 $117,000 in credit card debt.
3542292 3544270 - What?<br />- I pulled up some of the merchandise.
3544294 3546314 There are these fun<br />little splurges.
3546338 3547898 I didn't buy any of this stuff.
3547922 3549066 I don't even golf!
3549090 3550443 I do!<br />You bought great clubs.
3550467 3551777 I like the robot dog.
3551801 3553779 This is identity theft!<br />This is a felony!
3553803 3554780 We need to find<br />out who did this!
3554804 3556574 All right. Let's talk<br />about life insurance.
3556598 3559160 Because in April, you bumped<br />up Amy's life insurance...
3559184 3560202 To $1.2 million.
3560226 3562621 Yes, I did. That was her idea.<br />She wanted me to.
3562645 3563831 You filed the paperwork.
3563855 3565055 Because she told me to!
3565834 3566834 Hold on a sec.
3566858 3568648 Yeah? Okay.
3570570 3571740 For sure?
3572155 3573325 All right.
3577410 3578410 She was pregnant.
3582499 3584143 This is insane.
3584167 3586687 So, my question becomes...
3586711 3589649 I don't want to talk<br />to you again, ever...
3589673 3590843 Without a lawyer.
3599182 3600182 Margo!
3611069 3612069 Hey.
3614447 3616884 Just hold on a second.<br />Let me finish.
3616908 3617843 Nick?
3617867 3620680 I hear you, I hear you. I<br />was as surprised as...
3620704 3624544 I know you're upset.<br />I had no idea she was pregnant.
3624958 3628088 Listen, I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't...
3630588 3632733 you want to know the truth?
3632757 3635127 The truth is, Amy<br />didn't want kids.
3637554 3639604 Well, I'm as surprised as...
3640932 3642732 you told me you<br />didn't want kids.
3643727 3645127 I was trying to put<br />a good face on.
3645145 3647039 Then, suddenly, you've<br />got a pregnant wife.
3647063 3648416 That's a problem for you.
3648440 3651544 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3651568 3653045 Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!
3653069 3654399 You have to fucking talk to me!
3657073 3661137 I didn't tell you that she didn't want<br />kids because she didn't want me to.
3661161 3663389 Because it would have just been<br />another reason for you to hate her.
3663413 3665307 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just...
3665331 3667560 - lie to me?<br />- I wanted kids!
3667584 3669770 When we first moved here, I<br />went to a fertility clinic!
3669794 3671480 - It didn't work?<br />- I did my part!
3671504 3672565 Masturbate.
3672589 3674317 When it came time for Amy to do her<br />thing, all of a sudden it was like...
3674341 3675901 "Well, I don't know. Maybe.<br />No, thanks."
3675925 3677925 Now, who would believe you?
3679095 3680295 All right.
3689939 3691751 This is a letter<br />from the clinic...
3691775 3694253 Notifying me that they're<br />gonna destroy my sample...
3694277 3696277 Unless I contact them.
3697530 3699091 So, I gave it to Amy.
3699115 3702136 The next day, I saw<br />it in the trash.
3702160 3703763 But you were already with<br />Andie by then, right?
3703787 3706640 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3706664 3710844 A year ago, Amy being pregnant would<br />have been the best thing ever!
3717384 3719278 "When your poor Amy has a<br />cold, this dessert just..."
3719302 3720696 this is the clue you<br />couldn't solve.
3720720 3721850 Yeah.
3723556 3726952 A letter from desi. That<br />creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
3726976 3729372 It was the fucking rich guy who<br />would do anything for her.
3729396 3731374 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3731398 3732398 Your prenup?
3732732 3735711 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3735735 3737525 I don't know, Go!<br />Maybe I hate her!
3740407 3743552 I love you no matter what.
3743576 3744970 But you need to tell me.
3744994 3746414 Tell you what?
3747247 3748867 What are you asking me?
3750458 3753628 Are you asking me if I<br />killed my wife, Go?
3754087 3756190 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3756214 3758634 I would never ask you that!
3762595 3763595 Margo!
3776401 3778611 Don't walk on the glass.
3780321 3782951 You have no clue, do you?
3800759 3802339 Why was he here that night?
3803970 3806824 His wife is missing.<br />Why come here?
3806848 3807848 Who cares?
3808058 3809327 Rhonda, we got this.
3809351 3810870 Let's make the arrest.
3810894 3812997 Do you know how hard it is to make<br />a murder case without a body?
3813021 3813956 No.
3813980 3816167 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3816191 3819086 So, I want one last thing.
3819110 3820110 What's that?
3821738 3824028 I want a body.
3825200 3829638 Picture me. I'm a girl<br />who's very, very bad.
3829662 3831292 Be careful.
3835835 3840255 I need to be punished, and<br />by "punished," I mean "had."
3844803 3845803 Fuck.
3847764 3850604 It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.
3851851 3854038 So, open the door...
3854062 3855456 Punish. Wood. Beach.
3855480 3857980 And look alive.
3861111 3863701 Punish. Wood.
3864864 3866454 Wood.
3898565 3901293 I will practice believing<br />my husband loves me...
3901317 3903737 And will love this baby.
3904404 3908034 That this child might<br />really save our marriage.
3908908 3910368 But I could be wrong.
3916541 3918461 Because sometimes...
3919461 3921671 The way he looks at me...
3922756 3924525 I think...
3924549 3925629 Man of my dreams...
3927552 3929642 Father of my child...
3930430 3934430 This man of mine may kill me.
3935810 3937810 He may truly...
3938730 3939730 Kill me.
3942442 3943442 Wtf?
3968385 3970975 I am so much happier<br />now that I'm dead.
3976017 3977597 Technically, "missing."
3978436 3980096 Soon to be presumed dead.
3981815 3982945 Gone.
3983900 3987171 And my lazy, lying, cheating,<br />oblivious husband...
3987195 3990485 Will go to prison for my murder.
3991783 3994345 Nick Dunne took my pride<br />and my dignity...
3994369 3996889 And my hope and my money.
3996913 4000518 He took and took from me<br />until I no longer existed.
4000542 4001978 That's murder.
4002002 4004802 Let the punishment<br />fit the crime.
4005380 4008380 To fake a convincing murder,<br />you have to have discipline.
4012595 4015595 You befriend a local idiot.
4019144 4022314 Harvest the details<br />of her humdrum life.
4022689 4026279 And cram her with stories about<br />your husband's violent temper.
4027402 4029702 Secretly create some<br />money troubles.
4029946 4033116 Credit cards, perhaps<br />online gambling.
4035744 4037972 With the help of<br />the unwitting...
4037996 4039996 Bump up your life insurance.
4041708 4044895 Purchase getaway car.<br />Craigslist.
4044919 4048209 Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.
4048673 4053321 You need to package yourself so that<br />people will truly mourn your loss.
4053345 4056315 And America loves<br />pregnant women.
4056639 4059660 As if it's so hard<br />to spread your legs.
4059684 4060984 You know what's hard?
4061478 4063456 Faking a pregnancy.
4063480 4065650 First, drain your toilet.
4067359 4070129 Invite pregnant idiot<br />into your home...
4070153 4072663 And ply her with lemonade.
4077827 4079997 Steal pregnant idiot's urine.
4082207 4083726 Voilà.
4083750 4087710 A pregnancy is now part of<br />your legal medical record.
4094219 4095549 Happy anniversary.
4098223 4100993 Wait for your<br />clueless husband...
4101017 4102887 To start his day.
4104354 4105831 Off he goes.
4105855 4108015 And the clock is ticking.
4109192 4111692 Meticulously stage<br />your crime scene...
4112362 4116372 With just enough mistakes to<br />raise the specter of doubt.
4117784 4119744 You need to bleed.
4120078 4121078 A lot.
4121705 4123375 A lot, a lot.
4126710 4128540 A head wound kind of bleed.
4129212 4131712 A crime scene kind of bleed.
4134718 4136862 You need to clean poorly...
4136886 4137886 Like he would.
4138596 4141096 Clean and bleed.<br />Bleed and clean.
4141725 4144315 And leave a little<br />something behind.
4144978 4146728 A fire in July?
4148273 4149375 And because you're you...
4149399 4150649 You don't stop there.
4151067 4153295 You need a diary.
4153319 4156239 Minimum, 300 entries on<br />the Nick and Amy story.
4156906 4159218 Start with the fairy<br />tale early days.
4159242 4161554 Those are true. And<br />they're crucial.
4161578 4163578 You want Nick and<br />Amy to be likeable.
4163913 4166559 After that, you invent.
4166583 4167583 The spending.
4167584 4169395 The abuse. The fear.
4169419 4172398 The threat of violence.
4172422 4174382 And Nick thought<br />he was the writer.
4175091 4176381 Burn it just the right amount.
4178219 4180099 Make sure the cops will find it.
4185101 4188151 Finally, honor tradition with<br />a very special treasure hunt.
4190732 4193544 And if I get everything right,<br />the world will hate Nick...
4193568 4196297 For killing his<br />beautiful, pregnant wife.
4196321 4198966 And after all the outrage,<br />when I'm ready...
4198990 4200990 I'll go out on the water<br />with a handful of pills...
4200992 4203554 And a pocket full of stones.
4203578 4206390 And when they find my<br />body, they'll know...
4206414 4209727 Nick Dunne dumped his<br />beloved like garbage.
4209751 4212104 And she floated down<br />past all the other...
4212128 4215458 Abused, unwanted,<br />inconvenient women.
4216841 4218801 Then, Nick will die, too.
4219678 4221572 Nick and Amy will be gone.
4221596 4223741 But, then, we never<br />really existed.
4223765 4226994 Nick loved a girl I<br />was pretending to be.
4227018 4228018 "Cool girl."
4228478 4232333 Men always use that as<br />their defining compliment.
4232357 4233357 "She's a cool girl."
4234484 4235628 Cool girl is hot.
4235652 4237088 Cool girl is game.
4237112 4238112 Cool girl is fun.
4238446 4240966 Cool girl never gets<br />angry at her man.
4240990 4243620 She only smiles in a<br />chagrined, loving manner...
4244285 4247264 And then presents her<br />mouth for fucking.
4247288 4249308 She likes what he likes.
4249332 4252792 So evidently, he's a vinyl<br />hipster who loves fetish manga.
4253837 4257149 If he likes girls gone<br />wild, she's a mall babe...
4257173 4260987 Who talks football and endures<br />buffalo wings at Hooters.
4261011 4264615 When I met Nick Dunne, I<br />knew he wanted cool girl.
4264639 4267326 And for him, I'll admit,<br />I was willing to try.
4267350 4269350 I wax-stripped my pussy raw.
4270020 4273150 I drank canned beer watching<br />Adam Sandler movies.
4273398 4276210 I ate cold pizza and<br />remained a size two.
4276234 4278194 I blew him semi-regularly.
4279529 4280859 I lived in the moment.
4281156 4283696 I was fucking game.
4284325 4286365 I can't say I didn't<br />enjoy some of it.
4287203 4290516 Nick teased out of me things<br />I didn't know existed.
4290540 4293853 A lightness, a humor, an ease.
4293877 4296814 But I made him smarter. Sharper.
4296838 4300484 I inspired him to<br />rise to my level.
4300508 4304258 I forged the man of my dreams.
4306598 4309535 We were happy pretending<br />to be other people.
4309559 4311389 We were the happiest<br />couple we knew.
4313021 4316021 And what's the point of being<br />together if you're not the happiest?
4316691 4318919 But Nick got lazy.
4318943 4321172 He became someone I did<br />not agree to marry.
4321196 4324366 He actually expected me to<br />love him unconditionally.
4325033 4329555 Then he dragged me, penniless, to<br />the navel of this great country...
4329579 4333559 And found himself a newer,<br />younger, bouncier...
4333583 4334583 Cool girl.
4336920 4341090 You think I'd let him destroy me<br />and end up happier than ever?
4341591 4343261 No fucking way.
4343635 4345435 He doesn't get to win.
4355772 4359732 My cute, charming,<br />salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy.
4362153 4364613 He needed to learn.
4365323 4367953 Grown-ups work for things.
4368493 4370453 Grown-ups pay.
4371830 4374420 Grown-ups suffer consequences.
4377919 4379129 Wait.
4379504 4382316 I need 20 seconds where you<br />don't judge me, interrupt me...
4382340 4383970 Or get angry.
4385427 4386967 Okay.
4390932 4392910 Is that all the stuff<br />from the credit cards?
4392934 4396122 Where do you store goodies<br />for anniversary five?
4396146 4396956 Wood.
4396980 4400126 - Woodshed.<br />- Yeah, my woodshed.
4400150 4402650 That fucking bitch.
4404487 4405840 - I thought...<br />- It's all right.
4405864 4407324 I would have, too.
4410785 4412013 What's that present?
4412037 4413806 I don't know.
4413830 4415790 Let's find out.
4422380 4426319 "Dear husband, I know you think you're<br />moving through this world unseen."
4426343 4427778 "Don't believe that<br />for a second."
4427802 4430083 "I know where you've been, and<br />I know where you're going."
4433308 4435369 "For this anniversary,<br />I've arranged a trip."
4435393 4437288 "Follow the river, up, up, up."
4437312 4440041 "Sit back and relax,<br />because you are done."
4440065 4441500 What's "up, up river"?
4441524 4443711 "Up the river." Prison.
4443735 4445671 Fucking crazy bitch.
4445695 4447340 That's what this is.
4447364 4449675 She's framing me for her murder.
4449699 4451010 You married a<br />complete psychopath.
4451034 4453179 The morning of our<br />anniversary...
4453203 4457516 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4457540 4460019 I couldn't fake it for<br />another year, another day.
4460043 4460978 Then what happened?
4461002 4462313 Before I could say<br />anything, she said...
4462337 4465733 "I need you to go somewhere and<br />really think about our marriage."
4465757 4467026 She knew I would go<br />to Sawyer Beach.
4467050 4468361 So you'd have no alibi.
4468385 4470605 She stage-managed me.
4470887 4474575 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4474599 4476160 I went to the beach, I<br />thought about our marriage.
4476184 4477912 I came back and decided<br />I wanted a divorce.
4477936 4479176 And by the time you got home...
4479187 4480727 she was gone.
4481249 4482249 You fuck!
4482273 4483863 She's good.
4484859 4486879 Part of me was relieved...
4486903 4489203 When I thought she was gone.
4493576 4495286 Punch and Judy puppets.
4498289 4501394 Remember, he beats Judy to<br />death and kills that baby.
4501418 4502538 So I'm punch.
4503545 4505555 We already knew that,<br />Amy, what's your point?
4506715 4509555 Does Missouri have<br />the death penalty?
4536453 4537873 Hey, neighbor.
4538788 4541168 It's been weeks since I had<br />anyone decent next door.
4541791 4544437 Well, I don't know<br />how decent I feel.
4544461 4547606 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast death metal at 4 am...
4547630 4549650 We're gonna be best friends.
4549674 4551777 All right. Nice meeting you.
4551801 4553391 I'm Greta.
4554012 4555323 I'm Nancy.
4555347 4557325 Are you going to the Marina?<br />I could use some creamer.
4557349 4558784 I'm sorry. I can't.
4558808 4560018 I've got work to do.
4560310 4562350 All right. See you around!
4562645 4564555 You will.
4610527 4615737 Come on. Show me that<br />darling Nicky smile.
4617534 4619414 You asshole.
4634884 4636394 Hey.
4639180 4640930 Nancy.
4643226 4645056 Nancy.
4646062 4648272 It's hot again today.
4650567 4652397 So, where are you from?
4652902 4654072 Let me guess.
4657198 4658198 Nebraska.
4660410 4661620 New Orleans.
4665081 4667601 You know, I am an expert oiler.
4667625 4669437 Oh, I just bet you are.
4669461 4672091 Lotions and balms. Ointment.
4672797 4674734 I would hate for y'all<br />to get tan lines.
4674758 4676758 So sweet.
4677594 4680264 Okay. You know where I'll be.
4683141 4685561 I see we have the<br />same taste in men.
4687270 4689540 I clipped it on a<br />bathroom cabinet.
4689564 4692614 Least you could do is not<br />keep his secrets for him.
4693651 4695046 Let me guess.
4695070 4698950 He's trying to watch the big<br />game and you just won't shut up.
4699240 4702094 No, you don't seem<br />like much of a talker.
4702118 4703118 I got it.
4703119 4705598 You caught your boy rubbing up<br />on some hot little skank...
4705622 4707622 And he apologized to you<br />by busting you a good one.
4710001 4711001 Worse.
4711127 4712127 Worse?
4712962 4716692 I went to the bar where<br />he works to surprise him.
4716716 4721426 And out he comes with this girl who<br />had no business being in a bar.
4724391 4726391 On the very first<br />night that we met...
4726643 4730813 We walked by a bakery that was<br />having their sugar delivered.
4731648 4734043 And it was in the<br />air, everywhere.
4734067 4736379 A sugar storm.
4736403 4738547 And before he kissed me...
4738571 4740661 He leaned in...
4742158 4744448 And did this.
4755130 4757608 - And guess what.<br />- What?
4757632 4759342 He did the exact<br />same thing with her.
4763596 4766617 That is the most disgusting<br />thing I ever heard.
4766641 4768351 Thank you.
4783116 4784696 Thanks very much.
4791499 4793789 Well, we've gone mainstream.
4809392 4812538 It's an appeals process, so we<br />will attempt to appeal to them.
4812562 4814692 Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?
4816566 4818002 Nick Dunne.
4818026 4820316 I have been sitting by<br />the phone, my friend.
4823782 4825051 I'm sorry.
4825075 4826927 Do you not believe me?
4826951 4830222 No, I believe you. It's just the<br />craziest thing I've ever heard.
4830246 4833576 I love it. But, for<br />you, it sucks.
4834292 4837605 But you gotta have a grudging respect<br />for your wife at this point, right?
4837629 4839231 - Are you laughing me out of the building?<br />- No!
4839255 4841025 Are you kidding me?<br />I'm in.
4841049 4842526 I'm way in.
4842550 4845196 You came to the right guy.<br />This is what I do, Nick.
4845220 4848658 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.<br />I win the unwinnable cases.
4848682 4850368 $100,000?
4850392 4851952 We'll figure something out.
4851976 4853016 I'll give you a special...
4853019 4855956 "My wife is skilled in the<br />art of vengeance" rate.
4855980 4857041 Okay.
4857065 4858709 So, what's the plan?
4858733 4860628 Well, right now, it's a<br />"he said, she said."
4860652 4863130 - She's telling a better story.<br />- No, Nick.
4863154 4864994 She is telling the<br />perfect story.
4865281 4868594 So, we need to start today to prepare<br />your defense, should we need it.
4868618 4871018 And if we decide to go with your version of...<br />- the truth.
4871913 4875267 Then we'll need to realign the<br />public's perception of Amy.
4875291 4877561 Make them stop seeing her<br />as America's sweetheart...
4877585 4880915 And see her for what she is, which<br />a mind-fucker of the first degree.
4881339 4885319 Now, that is a huge realignment. We'll<br />need other voices besides yours.
4885343 4887613 There has to be someone out there<br />that she's screwed with in the past.
4887637 4890741 There's a New York guy.<br />O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
4890765 4893160 Eight years ago, she pressed<br />charges against him.
4893184 4895354 That should be easy to find.
4895895 4899291 Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.
4899315 4901195 She said that he stalked her.<br />He's in St. Louis.
4902485 4904735 You go talk to Tommy, and<br />I'll draw up the contract.
4909034 4912044 I told you, you came<br />to the right guy.
4914247 4915457 Apparently.
4924507 4926319 Tommy?
4926343 4927893 Yeah.
4928303 4930263 - Thanks for seeing me.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4933350 4935060 You're gonna want a drink.
4935602 4936954 Yeah.
4936978 4939790 So, she said you got<br />physical with her.
4939814 4942793 No, dude, she said I raped her.
4942817 4945187 First degree, felony rape.
4945945 4947655 - Did you do it?<br />- Did you do it?
4948823 4950913 I was looking at<br />30 years to life.
4951451 4953012 - Did you get a trial?<br />- Fuck, no.
4953036 4955264 Do I look like I would<br />do well in the yard?
4955288 4958208 I pled down, man. Sexual<br />assault one, no jail time.
4958625 4960311 - That's something.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4960335 4961771 I've been unemployed for<br />the last eight years...
4961795 4964315 Because I have to write "sexual<br />offender" on every job application.
4964339 4967318 I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because<br />I have to register as a predator.
4967342 4970682 I haven't had a date in almost a decade,<br />because if a girl googles me...
4972639 4974559 Could you walk me<br />through what happened?
4974849 4977995 I meet Amy at this<br />party, you know?
4978019 4979664 We click. She's perfect.
4979688 4982041 She's beautiful, she's<br />smart, she's well-read...
4982065 4984377 She's got an ass like a<br />20-year-old stripper.
4984401 4986212 I think, "what's the catch?"
4986236 4989406 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4990073 4993135 Girls like a<br />fixer-upper, but Amy?
4993159 4996639 She annexed me. She<br />made me her business.
4996663 5000476 It was just too much. She<br />went out and bought me ties.
5000500 5002728 And we must have gone<br />20 rounds over that.
5002752 5005523 Ties. The whole thing<br />just became...
5005547 5009360 - so, you broke up with her.<br />- No, I just backed away.
5009384 5012196 Gave her some space.<br />No big deal, right?
5012220 5013906 So I thought.
5013930 5016242 Then one night, Amy comes<br />over to my place...
5016266 5019203 With a bottle of bourbon and a<br />bootleg of this band I love.
5019227 5022248 And within two minutes, she's got<br />my pants around my ankles...
5022272 5023874 And she is kneeling down, and...
5023898 5025918 I'm sorry.<br />I know it's your wife.
5025942 5027837 - You had sex?<br />- Yeah, consensual.
5027861 5029951 It was rough, but she<br />was screaming for it.
5030405 5032745 Next morning, there's<br />two cops at my door.
5033074 5036012 Amy has wounds that are<br />consistent with rape.
5036036 5039223 Ligature marks on her<br />wrist, and my semen.
5039247 5042935 It looks like I've tied Amy<br />to my bed, and raped her.
5042959 5044437 Me!
5044461 5046230 And then, guess what they find.
5046254 5048304 Headboards of my bed,<br />one on each side.
5048715 5050067 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5050091 5051431 You do know your wife.
5052093 5053946 - Did you ever see her again?<br />- Yeah.
5053970 5055390 On TV, last week, with you.
5055972 5057408 I thought, "there's Amy."
5057432 5061442 "She's graduated from being<br />raped to being murdered."
5065273 5066459 You been watching this, too?
5066483 5067710 Last night's bombshell.
5067734 5068794 We just found out...
5068818 5071648 Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,<br />pregnant when she went missing.
5072155 5075134 Kelly Capitono, this<br />makes me wanna throw up.
5075158 5078137 What is it about a pregnant woman, a<br />woman carrying life inside her...
5078161 5079638 That turns men into animals?
5079662 5081162 Ellen, this is an epidemic.
5081456 5083726 The third leading cause of<br />death among pregnant women...
5083750 5086145 Is homicide committed by<br />a boyfriend or husband.
5086169 5089065 Let's not forget about<br />the wife, ever.
5089089 5093152 Tonight, we welcome Amy's best<br />friend, Noelle Hawthorne.
5093176 5095571 Thanks for being on<br />the show, Noelle.
5095595 5096906 Thank you, Ellen.
5096930 5098449 And let me just say this...
5098473 5102078 Amy would have loved you,<br />and all you do for women.
5102102 5103162 Oh, that's nice.
5103186 5105331 Why don't you tell us about<br />your friend, Noelle?
5105355 5107917 Amy was so nurturing.
5107941 5110336 Oh, I'd love if just once,<br />someone was like...
5110360 5111650 "She was a real rag."
5114155 5116759 She was beautiful<br />and smart and kind.
5116783 5118844 Seems like a rich bitch to me.
5118868 5121514 What do you mean?<br />People love her.
5121538 5123958 I don't know. She seems uppity.
5125667 5128187 Spoiled rich girl, married<br />a cheating asshole.
5128211 5129438 Paid the ultimate price.
5129462 5132942 The only secret was her husband.<br />We never met Nick.
5132966 5134610 He never introduced himself.
5134634 5137029 Why was that, Noelle?<br />Why do you think?
5137053 5138053 I think we know why.
5138847 5141117 Because he had a violent temper.
5141141 5142201 A little harsh.
5142225 5143828 That's life, baby.
5143852 5145413 He knew I'd have seen<br />right through him.
5146354 5147707 Don't get me wrong.
5147731 5149625 I'm not saying it's<br />okay he killed her.
5149649 5153069 I'm just saying, there<br />are consequences.
5155196 5156215 Fuck, yeah.
5156239 5158676 She was so alone.
5158700 5160636 And she was so innocent.
5160660 5164140 You're a good friend, Noelle. And<br />you're a good friend of the show.
5164164 5165391 Thanks for coming on.
5165415 5166892 Please tell me you<br />landed Tanner Bolt.
5166916 5169228 Tanner Bolt landed me.
5169252 5172565 I'm gonna try and see Desi<br />Collings on my way home.
5172589 5174567 And, go...
5174591 5177761 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5178219 5179679 That's just the retainer.
5180055 5183701 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
5183725 5185830 I'm approved for a second<br />mortgage on the house.
5185854 5186829 We will go from there.
5186853 5188603 Thank you.
5189356 5191042 - I love you.<br />- I love you, too.
5191066 5193836 Nick keeps his father, who has<br />Alzheimer's, in a facility.
5193860 5196088 Number of times he<br />visited last year? One.
5196112 5197112 Oh, fuck!
5197113 5199842 His twin sister, Margo,<br />well, she is a peach.
5199866 5202196 These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.
5202786 5204930 Playing what, Lauren?<br />Playing house?
5204954 5206098 What the fuck?
5206122 5208792 Twin siblings often<br />enable and abet.
5209292 5211132 While I never examined<br />Nick, or his sister...
5211920 5214050 They both seem very, very close.
5214381 5215631 It's twin-cest.
5215965 5218694 Disturbingly close, Lauren.
5218718 5220738 And so, we close<br />with a question.
5220762 5222281 What kind of moral rot...
5222305 5227036 Allows a beautiful, talented,<br />kind, smart, loving mother...
5227060 5230790 To vanish without the heavens<br />hearing our outraged cries?
5230814 5231874 Can I bum a cigarette?
5231898 5235648 Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about<br />you, and we will not forget.
5236152 5238381 And you know what<br />else we won't forget?
5238405 5240800 Missouri has the death penalty.
5240824 5241994 Amen.
5267851 5270162 I'd like to report some<br />strange activity...
5270186 5273686 Near the woodshed on the<br />property of one Margo Dunne.
5314898 5316358 Hey.
5321905 5324035 - Mr. Dunne.<br />- Mr. Collings.
5325033 5328137 I know you.<br />I saw you at the volunteer center.
5328161 5329871 I wanted to help.
5330663 5332391 I hope you don't<br />mind me coming by.
5332415 5335495 I got your address from this<br />letter that you wrote my wife.
5336378 5339899 Amy and I believe in the<br />lost art of letter-writing.
5339923 5343763 I always wondered why you<br />kept in touch after...
5344427 5345738 Everything.
5345762 5348199 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5348223 5350409 She was my first<br />serious girlfriend.
5350433 5353245 - Why did you break up?<br />- That's a strange question.
5353269 5355247 Did you treat her bad?<br />Did you cheat on her?
5355271 5356499 That's a rude question.
5356523 5358250 Let me tell you<br />what Amy told me.
5358274 5361253 She dumped you, you<br />completely unraveled.
5361277 5363381 You stalked her, you<br />threatened her...
5363405 5366926 And you attempted suicide in her<br />bed and were institutionalized.
5366950 5370888 Your wife is missing, and you came<br />all this way to tell me this?
5370912 5373122 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5376793 5378633 Mr. Collings.
5380714 5382634 Fuck.
5388263 5391283 The missing persons case<br />of Amy Elliott Dunne.
5391307 5394977 She is the beautiful blonde inspiration<br />for the amazing Amy kids' book series.
5412162 5414390 You're reading that diary again?
5414414 5415474 You know how it ends.
5415498 5417977 It interests me.
5418001 5419603 Hey, Rhonda.
5419627 5421564 "He's gonna kill me." The end.
5421588 5423733 Why did he go to his<br />dad's house to burn it?
5423757 5424900 It's private. There's<br />no one there.
5424924 5427737 Why didn't he make sure<br />it actually burned?
5427761 5430740 Because he tripped the alarm. You<br />were up his ass with a flashlight.
5430764 5433117 The whole thing<br />just feels hinky.
5433141 5435244 Like finding an<br />envelope marked "clue."
5435268 5436412 You ever hear the expression...
5436436 5438277 "The simplest answer is<br />often the correct one"?
5438980 5441000 Actually, I've never<br />found that to be true.
5441024 5442824 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
5445487 5446487 Hey.
5455955 5457850 Elvis is in Missouri.
5457874 5460019 Thank God. Come on in.
5460043 5462923 First thing you have to understand<br />about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.
5463046 5465524 - Play God.<br />- Yeah, old testament God.
5465548 5466609 Okay. Keep talking.
5466633 5468361 She finds out I've been<br />cheating on her with Andie...
5468385 5469987 Decides to teach me a lesson.
5470011 5471947 Fakes her own death,<br />frames me for it.
5471971 5474200 Blood in the house, credit<br />cards, life insurance.
5474224 5475451 She does the treasure hunt.
5475475 5476827 Now, the treasure<br />hunt is critical.
5476851 5479300 She's taking us on a<br />tour of my infidelities.
5479324 5480539 Rubbing my nose in it.
5480563 5482625 And she leaves clue number<br />one for the police...
5482649 5484377 Which will lead them<br />back to my office...
5484401 5486962 Which is a place where<br />Andie and I would often...
5486986 5488339 And she leaves a<br />pair of red panties.
5488363 5489548 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5489572 5491300 - Clue two.<br />- My father's house.
5491324 5493719 Another place where Andie and I<br />would occasionally have relations.
5493743 5495137 - Clue three?<br />- Woodshed.
5495161 5496681 - Also a location...<br />- Oh, my God.
5496705 5498474 - We had limited options.<br />- A hotel.
5498498 5501018 - Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br />- Put it on Andie's credit card.
5501042 5502395 Andie's statement went<br />right to her parents.
5502419 5504981 Nick, Margo, can we head over<br />to the little brown house?
5505005 5506816 - This leads us to what?<br />- My dad's house.
5506840 5508590 Dad's house is blue.
5509884 5512934 After the divorce, when dad<br />wasn't coming around...
5513263 5517535 I used to pretend that he was<br />a spy named Mr. Brown, who...
5517559 5521247 For the sake of his children's<br />safety, had to deny their existence.
5521271 5522691 You never told me that.
5522939 5524750 You told her that?
5524774 5527074 We've got incriminating red<br />panties in your office.
5527402 5529802 We've got a showcase showdown<br />worth of crap in your woodshed.
5530905 5534260 So, what in God's name is at<br />your father's house, Nick?
5534284 5535386 And be honest.
5535410 5537250 I honestly have no idea.
5544419 5548129 Whatever they found, I think it's<br />safe to assume that it's very bad.
5549966 5552216 We got a lot of<br />uncontained issues here.
5552469 5555559 Nick, do you have any idea as<br />to what Andie's mindset is?
5556765 5558576 Well we haven't communicated<br />since the vigil.
5558600 5559952 Okay. Amy's parents?
5559976 5561579 - No, it's...<br />- More pressure.
5561603 5564874 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who<br />will no doubt go public at any moment.
5564898 5566417 - No, Andie won't do that.<br />- She will.
5566441 5568151 They always do. Don't<br />take it personally.
5568651 5570821 Amy's got us in an<br />interesting bind.
5571154 5573466 - We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br />- Really?
5573490 5575660 Right now, Andie just<br />gives you another motive.
5576493 5577663 We need to tell the cops<br />about the woodshed.
5577952 5579388 We need to be on the<br />front end of that.
5579412 5581752 But I'm gonna warn you<br />as to what will happen.
5582332 5583559 They'll go after Margo.
5583583 5584602 They can't do that, can they?
5584626 5586562 She's your accomplice. She<br />helped you hide the evidence.
5586586 5588666 In all likelihood, she<br />knows that you killed Amy.
5589589 5591009 God.
5591341 5593444 Well, what are we going to do?
5593468 5594468 We find Amy.
5594761 5597114 No. Any other strategy<br />is missing the point.
5597138 5599492 I've got two ex-secret service<br />guys that are really good.
5599516 5601160 I'll put them on it.
5601184 5602604 But where do they start, Nick?
5602977 5604097 Where would Amy go?
5606272 5607902 I have no idea.
5612362 5614992 Are we keeping score?
5615657 5617027 Hey!
5618660 5621847 I thought we were steering<br />clear of men for a while.
5621871 5622871 He's nice.
5622872 5625372 Because he wants to fuck you.
5627002 5628542 She's still moping about her ex?
5630338 5633008 He got cheated on, too.
5636386 5639281 We three are the saddest<br />sacks in all the Ozarks.
5639305 5640845 I'm not sad.
5641391 5642391 I'm angry.
5642392 5644203 There you go.
5644227 5646872 I almost drank myself to<br />death when my wife left me.
5646896 5649166 I was gonna kill myself.<br />Can you believe that?
5649190 5650334 Don't give him the pleasure.
5650358 5653504 I was going to drown myself<br />in the Gulf of Mexico...
5653528 5656048 Let myself be dinner<br />for the great whites.
5656072 5657883 Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.
5657907 5661846 Why should I die? I'm<br />not the asshole.
5661870 5664330 Please put that on a t-shirt.
5672881 5675261 Miss moneybags.<br />I thought you said you were broke.
5676760 5678050 That's a fat wad.
5679846 5681657 It's mostly singles.
5681681 5683561 Singles? What are<br />you, a stripper?
5684351 5686941 Swamp girls, or treasure chest?
5688063 5689113 We're just teasing.
5689898 5691688 Don't they tease<br />people down in Nola?
5694110 5697089 We can expect Nick Dunne's<br />arrest any day now.
5697113 5700843 We've got blood in the house,<br />huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.
5700867 5704847 And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,<br />missing for five days...
5704871 5707001 Crying out for justice.
5707791 5709501 We'll be right back.
5761761 5764365 Tanner has a very bad idea<br />he's going to pitch you.
5764389 5765199 Yeah?
5765223 5766826 You're doing Sharon Schieber<br />tomorrow in St. Louis.
5766850 5767868 It could go so wrong.
5767892 5769662 And you are going to<br />tell her about Andie.
5769686 5770997 Nope.
5771021 5773040 That sounds like<br />a very bad idea.
5773064 5775167 You haven't heard from<br />her in three days.
5775191 5778921 This is a ticking time bomb.<br />You've gotta throw yourself on it.
5778945 5781507 - People are gonna hate me.<br />- And then, they will forgive you.
5781531 5784010 A guy admitting that he's a<br />gigantic asshole on television?
5784034 5785704 People empathize with that.
5787120 5789056 - Why don't we just put out a statement?<br />- They need to see you.
5789080 5792184 Sharon's specials, they<br />get 10 million viewers.
5792208 5794729 She is a crusader. If she<br />takes you on as a cause...
5794753 5796689 she's going to ask<br />real questions.
5796713 5798566 I will drill you as if you<br />were doing a deposition.
5798590 5800067 What to say, what not to say.
5800091 5801235 A trained monkey?
5801259 5803379 A trained monkey who doesn't<br />get the lethal injection.
5804637 5808117 Nick, this case is about<br />what people think of you.
5808141 5809910 They need to like you.
5809934 5813774 Now, you do this and you will<br />reach millions of those people.
5814939 5817439 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5826720 5827720 Hello?
5827744 5828954 Hey, baby.
5830413 5832003 One minute.
5840757 5842234 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
5842258 5843258 You clearing out?
5843259 5845112 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5845136 5846739 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5846763 5847823 I'll come by before...
5847847 5849597 let us give you a hand.
5855772 5858232 Yeah, you gotta clear<br />everything out, here.
5859901 5862611 Dorothy is a real stickler.
5863947 5867237 Not even a spare hanger<br />can you leave behind.
5869828 5871429 Gotta make sure nothing's<br />tucked inside.
5873915 5874915 A sock...
5875834 5878634 Or undies or what have you.
5883466 5884796 You did a real good job.
5886803 5888933 Where is the money, sweetheart?
5892600 5893600 Look under her dress.
5895145 5896414 He talked you into this?
5896438 5897790 I talked him into it.
5897814 5899824 The second you leave,<br />I'm calling the cops.
5900316 5904005 Your glasses are fake. Your<br />hair's dyed all hamster.
5904029 5907133 You say your name's Nancy, but you<br />don't even answer to it half the time.
5907157 5909635 You're hiding. I don't know<br />why, and I don't really care.
5909659 5911699 But you ain't gonna<br />call the cops.
5912037 5914117 And I don't think you've<br />ever really been hit before.
5920337 5922337 Holy shit.
5925383 5928195 Sorry, but we really<br />need the money.
5928219 5929864 Next place, be more<br />careful, okay?
5929888 5932248 There are a lot of people out<br />there a lot worse than we are.
5966841 5968471 Excuse me. You can't sleep here.
5996079 5999169 I did not kill my wife.
6000166 6003479 Why don't you try it again?<br />A little less wooden.
6003503 6004593 I didn't kill my wife.
6006423 6008150 - What are you doing?<br />- Every time you look smug...
6008174 6010861 Or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna<br />hit you with a gummy bear.
6010885 6012863 - That's supposed to make me less tense?<br />- Let's try it again.
6012887 6016177 Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,<br />you and your wife had some bumps.
6017225 6021205 Yeah, we had some tough years.<br />I lost my job.
6021229 6022229 You both did.
6024941 6026836 We both lost our jobs.
6026860 6029422 I had to move back home so we<br />could take care of my mother...
6029446 6032008 Who was dying of cancer<br />and my dad, who had...
6032032 6033801 your dad's scorched earth.
6033825 6035511 Let's talk about your<br />mom, how close you were.
6035535 6036721 Go on.
6036745 6039265 For a while, things<br />had been building up.
6039289 6042810 "Built up" implies that an<br />explosion is coming. No.
6042834 6045254 At a certain point, we<br />got on the wrong track.
6046087 6047732 I had a moment of weakness.
6047756 6050166 Your "moment" was<br />over 15 months.
6053970 6056060 I disrespected my wife.
6056723 6059143 And I disrespected my marriage.
6059601 6060981 And I'll always regret it.
6061580 6062580 That works.
6062604 6065041 Don't be afraid to play up the<br />dufus husband thing, Nick.
6065065 6066792 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up."
6066816 6067668 "Everything I do is wrong."
6067692 6069742 I know. What men are<br />supposed to do in general.
6071863 6072923 - Thank you.<br />- How do you feel?
6072947 6076157 I feel good. Go, can you<br />pass me that box, please?
6076576 6079221 It's Amy's 33rd<br />birthday present to me.
6079245 6080264 You hate that watch.
6080288 6082391 No, Go. I love that watch.
6082415 6084435 Just like I love this tie.
6084459 6087589 Just like I love my wife.
6117951 6119345 It's you!
6119369 6121369 It's you.
6122205 6124205 I'm sorry.
6124874 6126214 I'm sorry.
6127127 6129146 Good God.
6129170 6130550 Last week...
6131047 6136217 I threatened to leave, and he said<br />he'd find me and he'd kill me.
6136553 6138723 So, I disappeared.
6139889 6141719 I lost the baby.
6142225 6144036 I couldn't even tell my parents.
6144060 6147980 I'm so ashamed and<br />I'm so afraid.
6148732 6149902 Well, he is looking for you.
6150567 6152545 He showed up on my<br />doorstep three days ago.
6152569 6155069 He tracked me from<br />my letters to you.
6156197 6157407 You saved them.
6157991 6159051 Knowing you were out there...
6159075 6161721 Was the only thing that's kept<br />me going these past few years.
6161745 6163139 Let's go to the police. You<br />can explain everything.
6163163 6164473 No, I can't turn up now.
6164497 6167577 I'd be a pariah.<br />Everyone would hate me.
6169419 6171731 Is it wrong to want<br />Nick to go to prison?
6171755 6173595 He should go to prison<br />for what he's done.
6176426 6178904 I'm setting you up<br />at my lake house.
6178928 6179928 It's utterly secluded.
6181348 6183200 Why are you so good to me?
6183224 6184577 You know why.
6184601 6185745 Excuse me.
6185769 6186912 I know you, don't I?
6186936 6187747 No.
6187771 6189749 You're one of the<br />Nolan girls, right?
6189773 6192668 No, we're from Winnipeg.<br />Excuse us.
6192692 6193586 We should leave.
6193610 6194690 Just a second.
6195278 6198549 That was Boney. I'll<br />call her later.
6198573 6200453 Tanner. Nice to see you.
6200742 6201886 Sharon! Hi.
6201910 6203596 Hope this is worth my while.
6203620 6204750 You're gonna be very happy.
6205015 6206015 Sharon.
6206039 6208267 Ms. Schieber. Thank you<br />so much for doing this.
6208291 6210436 Can I get you anything to drink<br />or eat before we get started?
6210460 6212460 No, I had some gummy bears.
6213546 6215126 What the fuck?
6216299 6217429 I'm sorry?
6217842 6221739 We have a major shocking development<br />in the amazing Amy disappearance.
6221763 6223157 We go live to that story now.
6223181 6224471 Oh, my God.
6226643 6228454 You little slut.
6228478 6231478 My name is Andie Fitzgerald.
6232482 6234168 I met Nicholas Dunne...
6234192 6237838 When he was my creative writing<br />teacher at Mill Valley.
6237862 6239965 Why is she dressed<br />like a babysitter?
6239989 6241467 I am deeply ashamed...
6241491 6244637 Of having been romantically<br />involved with a married man.
6244661 6246597 The girl with the<br />giant cum-on-me tits.
6246621 6248641 I truly believed<br />we were in love.
6248665 6250505 Now, she looks like a<br />fucking mennonite.
6252002 6253479 I know that is no excuse.
6253503 6254814 No, it is not.
6254838 6259193 I do not, in my heart, believe Nick<br />Dunne would have killed for me.
6259217 6261654 My prayers go out to<br />everyone who loves Amy.
6261678 6264678 I apologize for the pain<br />this has caused them.
6269894 6271854 We have loved Nick<br />Dunne like a son.
6272689 6274069 That love ended today.
6274357 6276002 Come on, you're<br />staring at ghosts.
6276026 6278686 He met our trust<br />with lie after lie.
6279029 6280965 We now absolutely believe...
6280989 6283384 Nick is involved in the<br />disappearance of our daughter.
6283408 6285658 Our amazing Amy.
6286536 6288656 Well, this just got very exciting.
6289372 6291082 We need a moment.
6293084 6294854 We're gonna have to<br />bow out of this.
6294878 6296689 - Nothing has changed.<br />- Everything has changed.
6296713 6299150 An hour ago, we were ahead of this.<br />Now?
6299174 6300818 - I can handle this.<br />- We're on the defense.
6300842 6302903 This is a completely<br />different dynamic.
6302927 6305677 - I can handle it.<br />- She's going to eat you alive.
6306222 6307892 Just trust me.
6312270 6313664 Okay.
6313688 6314768 Great.
6315607 6317067 Mic him.
6336795 6338595 One, two, three, four, five.
6344928 6345928 Thank you.
6347097 6348407 He shouldn't smile at<br />the makeup artist.
6348431 6349431 Yeah, no kidding.
6354104 6357249 Roll tape. Five... four...
6357273 6358903 Three... two...
6361111 6364048 Seriously, I can't believe<br />how fucking good you were.
6364072 6365549 - Amy brings out the best in me.<br />- Don't.
6365573 6368761 Keep it together, you two.<br />At least for the next 24 hours.
6368785 6371222 People still hate you. Women<br />want to scratch your eyes out.
6371246 6373140 Andie was really good TV.
6373164 6375226 - She's a good person.<br />- Therein lies the problem.
6375250 6376268 Ride this out...
6376292 6379313 And when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll<br />be looking at a whole new you.
6379337 6380940 But, until then...
6380964 6382942 Don't show your face.
6382966 6384796 No problem.
6401109 6402489 Welcome.
6404487 6406340 Make yourself at home.
6406364 6410344 I've got music, satellite...
6410368 6411368 Netflix.
6411369 6412471 He was her teacher!
6412495 6413495 Roku.
6414039 6416539 Internet, obviously.
6417125 6419854 Here is a supposedly<br />grown man...
6419878 6423691 if there is ever anything you have a<br />taste for and you can't find it...
6423715 6425985 Just let me know and I<br />will get it for you.
6426009 6429155 Instead of the a-b-c's, he taught<br />her the birds and the bees.
6429179 6432116 And just think how her mother<br />must feel at a time like this.
6432140 6434140 Wine cellar's downstairs.
6437604 6438998 I'll get you some clothes, too.
6439022 6442442 Not that I don't<br />appreciate bait shop chic.
6443610 6446130 The floors are heated,<br />just dial to your liking.
6446154 6449342 There's robes and towels.<br />The shower has steam.
6449366 6451696 The bathtub has a massage cycle.
6453536 6455598 There's a great view,<br />if you're in the mood.
6455622 6457183 Blackout curtains if you're not.
6457207 6459685 The bed is savoir.
6459709 6461959 You'll never get a better sleep.
6465840 6468180 This is just what I need.
6469636 6471546 I'm so exhausted.
6473056 6475216 I'll leave you to it, then.
6476976 6479726 Amy, I am so happy<br />that you are here.
6480730 6483876 And I don't want you to<br />worry for one moment.
6483900 6485878 There are cameras everywhere.
6485902 6488798 The exterior, all along the<br />grounds, the entryway.
6488822 6489822 Anyone...
6489989 6492239 Who is caught coming or going...
6495495 6497085 Will be recorded.
6498665 6501385 You are more than safe.
6503336 6506836 And I am not letting<br />you get away again.
6552594 6554184 - Good morning!<br />- Don't do that!
6555930 6557060 I'm sorry.
6559059 6560559 I need to feel safe.
6560894 6563904 You are very safe.
6566107 6567752 - What have you been up to?<br />- Nothing.
6567776 6570504 Amy, I'm not Nick.
6570528 6572528 It's hard for me.
6575450 6579080 After so many years under<br />someone's thumb...
6581331 6582652 I know just what<br />that feels like.
6583541 6585541 You were never under my thumb.
6586127 6588189 - On your leash.<br />- Never.
6588213 6589713 A new start.
6591007 6592627 Decent clothes.
6593551 6595801 Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.
6596096 6597596 There's a gym<br />overlooking the lake.
6597972 6601535 The sooner you look like yourself, the<br />sooner you'll feel like yourself.
6601559 6604705 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br />Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.
6604729 6607269 I think that's something I<br />should watch on my own.
6607691 6609401 Nonsense.
6613029 6614449 I'll be back.
6616074 6618260 And I am looking forward...
6618284 6621204 To my reunion with Amy Elliott.
6644394 6645564 Great.
6646604 6648708 Good evening, I'm<br />Sharon Schieber.
6648732 6650362 - Tonight, exclusively...<br />- Hurry up.
6651276 6655673 A husband breaks his silence, not<br />just on his wife's disappearance...
6655697 6659487 But on his infidelity, and<br />all those shocking rumors.
6661953 6663514 Nick Dunne...
6663538 6667059 You're probably the most hated<br />man in America right now.
6667083 6669687 I probably am. And I<br />probably deserve it.
6669711 6671314 I bought that tie.
6671338 6673399 Did you kill your wife, Nick?
6673423 6676513 I did not kill my wife.
6677177 6678738 I am not a murderer.
6678762 6680698 But you were unfaithful.
6680722 6682950 I was unfaithful.
6682974 6684660 And I am deeply ashamed.
6684684 6687024 And, on top of that, you<br />allowed Amy's parents...
6687312 6690082 Her friends, all the<br />people in your hometown...
6690106 6695046 Believe you were a loving husband,<br />desperate to find his missing wife.
6695070 6696964 Well, I am desperate to<br />find my missing wife.
6696988 6700009 You say that, but I'm wondering how<br />you expect us to believe you...
6700033 6701743 Now that we know you're a liar.
6702035 6705181 I didn't come forward<br />with my affair...
6705205 6708375 Because I knew it would make<br />me look really, really bad.
6709209 6711020 But I don't care<br />about that anymore.
6711044 6712688 I just want to find my wife.
6712712 6715274 - I'm just trying to get clear...<br />- Let me be clear.
6715298 6719737 Just because I am not a murderer<br />doesn't make me a good guy.
6719761 6720931 I'm not a good guy.
6721346 6723806 I was a bad husband<br />to a great wife.
6724182 6725932 I broke the vow<br />that I made to her.
6726184 6728734 Those are pretty words, Nick.
6729062 6730831 But what does that<br />really mean to you?
6730855 6732895 It basically means that<br />I was a con artist.
6733858 6737088 I met Amy Elliott<br />seven years ago.
6737112 6738702 I was completely transfixed.
6739155 6741092 Amy can do that to you.
6741116 6743678 I was this average guy<br />from an average place...
6743702 6745721 With mediocre aspirations.
6745745 6748265 And I met a woman<br />who dazzled me.
6748289 6750267 And I wanted her to love me...
6750291 6752631 So I pretended to be<br />better than I was.
6753503 6757191 When we got married, I<br />promised to be that guy.
6757215 6759068 That guy who works harder.
6759092 6761320 That guy who, who<br />lives and acts...
6761344 6764264 And loves with as much<br />passion as she does.
6764514 6765724 But I failed her.
6766641 6768002 Instead of doing<br />what was right...
6769269 6770439 I did what was easy.
6771187 6774834 You talk like a man who believes<br />he can make amends to his wife.
6774858 6776502 Who believes his<br />wife is still alive.
6776526 6777816 She is still alive.
6779696 6782526 Will you look at<br />that camera for me?
6782866 6785845 Will you look in the lens...
6785869 6787847 And talk to your wife?
6787871 6790975 If she is out there, able to<br />hear and see you tonight...
6790999 6793669 What would you like<br />to say to her, Nick?
6797213 6799513 Amy, I love you.
6800216 6803029 You're the best person<br />I've ever known.
6803053 6807533 And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br />for the way that I've treated you.
6807557 6809535 And if you come<br />back, I promise...
6809559 6812059 I will spend every day<br />making it up to you.
6812562 6816402 I will be the man that I<br />promised you I would be.
6818985 6819985 I love you.
6820904 6822494 Come home.
6827243 6828243 Here.
6834376 6836020 Regardless of what<br />you thought...
6836044 6838230 What does it say?
6838254 6839815 I think we can all agree...
6839839 6841359 Oh, my God. You<br />fucking killed it.
6841383 6842568 There's more to him<br />than meets the eye.
6842592 6843713 They're going crazy for you.
6843718 6848240 They disliked me, they<br />liked me, they hated me.
6848264 6849909 And now they love me.
6849933 6852912 A candor and an honesty<br />that's worthy of respect.
6852936 6854846 He's certainly earned mine.
6855689 6856769 What is it?
6859609 6862779 I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.
6867701 6870513 Margo Dunne, this is a search<br />warrant for your property.
6870537 6872765 I usually ignore<br />tipline calls...
6872789 6877379 But a neighbor was concerned about a<br />strange man around your woodshed.
6877794 6878794 Call Tanner.
6878795 6879965 Okay. Fuck!
6884092 6885552 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.
6886803 6887884 Is that what this is about?
6889305 6894078 I have treated you more than fair<br />throughout this entire investigation.
6894102 6896414 I gave you the benefit of<br />the doubt over and over.
6896438 6897957 Every time you said<br />something stupid...
6897981 6900376 I thought, "maybe<br />he's just stupid."
6900400 6902962 But I was wrong. That's<br />what this is about.
6902986 6904130 Are these the clubs you<br />don't play golf with?
6904154 6905154 None of that is mine.
6905447 6907049 None of this was put here by me.
6907073 6910636 Those are nice clubs. You got<br />the makings of a real man cave.
6910660 6913806 Everything just waiting until<br />the wife goes away for good.
6913830 6914910 Nick!
6916166 6919086 - You can't do that!<br />- Of course we can.
6927385 6929989 Amy, it's time to move on.
6930013 6931723 What can I do to help?
6932432 6933993 I need some time to think.
6934017 6936537 - That's the last thing you need.<br />- Desi...
6936561 6939165 twenty years, you have<br />kept me dangling.
6939189 6942859 Finally, last night, you came<br />to me, and you chose me.
6943568 6944920 Follow that instinct.
6944944 6947364 Don't trust the instinct that<br />left you beaten and homeless...
6947906 6951076 Sleeping in your car,<br />fearing for your life.
6954412 6957122 I'm not gonna force<br />myself on you.
6959542 6962212 I understand what<br />you're saying, Desi.
6963463 6965093 I do.
6968426 6970426 I've been so mistreated<br />for so long.
6973098 6975978 I've forgotten how to behave.
6981731 6984043 I'll move in here tomorrow...
6984067 6986647 And we'll work it out together.
6988738 6992448 I just want you to be you again.
7000291 7001811 They only took Margo<br />to fuck with you.
7001835 7003562 She's not spending another<br />fucking second in there.
7003586 7006336 I'm gonna go in, and I'm<br />gonna tell them everything.
7007007 7008757 What?
7010760 7012405 We tell Boney very little.
7012429 7014573 Without a body, without<br />a murder weapon...
7014597 7016909 Their only hope is a confession.
7016933 7018911 So, you let them do<br />all the talking.
7018935 7021080 That way, we can<br />jump-start your defense.
7021104 7023484 The truth is my defense.
7029446 7030446 Recognize these?
7030447 7032591 Yes. It's Amy's anniversary<br />present to me.
7032615 7034427 Was that how she told you<br />she was pregnant, Nick?
7034451 7036951 Mommy, daddy, baby, and<br />that made you real mad?
7037454 7038624 No.
7039873 7041993 - Recognize this?<br />- Never seen that before in my life.
7042208 7045458 It's Amy's diary. We found<br />this at your father's house.
7047464 7048774 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7048798 7050818 - He's not a handwriting ex...<br />- Looks like it.
7050842 7051972 Our experts thought so, too.
7053303 7055013 Do you wanna play a<br />little true or false?
7055764 7056991 Sure.
7057015 7061485 "And then he brushes the sugar<br />off my lips so he can taste me."
7062604 7064614 Yeah, that's true.
7065857 7067857 You thought Quinoa was a fish?
7069152 7070492 That is also true, yes.
7072655 7074800 She wanted to get pregnant,<br />you assaulted her.
7074824 7076844 I hit her?<br />No, never happened.
7076868 7078512 - "Pushed," it says "pushed."<br />- Absolutely not.
7078536 7079616 I never touched her.
7082040 7083670 She tried to buy a gun.
7084334 7086214 I doubt that, but I don't know.
7087629 7089273 Shall I read the last entry?
7089297 7090337 Sure.
7091633 7093778 "This man may kill me."
7093802 7096030 In her own words, "this<br />man may kill me."
7096054 7098184 It's kind of a<br />convenient end note.
7104688 7106123 For future reference...
7106147 7108501 The truth, you are not<br />a handwriting expert.
7108525 7109575 Okay, I know.
7117992 7119832 Judy's missing handle.
7121371 7123683 Big as a two-by-four, right?<br />Big as a club.
7123707 7126477 We found this day one, in the<br />fireplace in your home office.
7126501 7129188 We didn't know what the hell<br />it was, but fire in July?
7129212 7130064 We bagged it.
7130088 7131232 I've never seen<br />that before either.
7131256 7133901 We just tested it. Fire<br />doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7133925 7136153 So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...
7136177 7137822 You're under arrest for<br />the murder of your wife.
7137846 7139073 Do not say another word.
7139097 7140427 - What about my side?<br />- Nick!
7153778 7155256 More coffee?
7155280 7157070 I'd love it.
7159367 7163014 Remember that time we skipped<br />school and drove to the cape?
7163038 7165599 God, yeah. Lobster<br />right from the ocean.
7165623 7167253 This reminds me of that.
7167751 7169421 Never-ending holiday.
7170962 7173190 You're not bored?
7173214 7174734 Desi, how could I be bored?
7174758 7177236 You can discuss<br />18th-century symphonies...
7177260 7180180 19th-century impressionists,<br />quote proust in French.
7180555 7184702 Nick's idea of culture was<br />a reality TV marathon...
7184726 7186596 With one hand down his boxers.
7188605 7190195 I really have to get going.
7190523 7193863 But I will be back<br />just as soon as I can.
7200450 7201530 My keys.
7206748 7208748 Thank you.
7219969 7221549 That's how the kids wear it.
7282365 7286195 Dunne? You got one<br />hell of a lawyer.
7289039 7290209 Hey.
7290623 7293019 - Are you okay?<br />- Yes. Are you?
7293043 7294312 Yeah.
7294336 7296206 Let's go.
7298048 7299275 What does this mean?
7299299 7301485 Well, you're out on bond.
7301509 7304719 You can relax at home<br />while we prep for trial.
7310226 7312226 Keep your head down.
7327660 7330056 Tanner, is there any<br />fucking lead on Amy?
7330080 7332080 I've got two of my<br />best guys on it.
7332582 7334212 She's air.
7336252 7339212 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7396438 7399000 Mr. Collings is home.
7399024 7401419 Hello, Mr. Collings.
7401443 7403337 I've missed you.
7403361 7404991 I've been thinking...
7405447 7407617 I don't wanna be without you.
7408324 7410678 Stay with me.
7410702 7413681 And when all this dies down, we'll<br />go to Greece, like you said.
7413705 7416005 Octopus and scrabble?
7418001 7420271 How long do you think<br />until it's done?
7420295 7423885 Not long. Six months for the trial.<br />Sentencing will be quick.
7424382 7425484 He'll appeal.
7425508 7427638 I can watch the rest overseas.
7445028 7446339 Go slowly.
7446363 7447363 But I want it.
7467717 7469320 Don't rush.
7469344 7471434 Just do it.
7479896 7481436 Harder.
7579996 7583166 You fucking bitch.
7591841 7595511 Don't you worry, you're<br />gonna have lots of babies.
7597138 7600660 Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br />There was semen present.
7600684 7601844 We'll make sure it's a match.
7601851 7603621 Yeah, it'll match.
7603645 7606123 Thank you very much.
7606147 7607667 What do you think?
7607691 7609001 Are we pals again?
7609025 7612588 Now that I know you didn't<br />murder your wife, yes.
7612612 7613612 What do you think?
7613613 7616533 Kidnapping?<br />The story's insane.
7618702 7621180 She's on fairly<br />heavy painkillers.
7621204 7623140 It's okay. I want to help.
7623164 7624600 Ms. Dunne, I know what<br />you've been through...
7624624 7626978 So we'll keep this very brief.
7627002 7629382 Can you walk us through<br />what happened?
7632007 7634627 That morning, the doorbell rang.
7635510 7637530 So normal.
7637554 7639394 I opened the door.
7640015 7641855 So strange.
7642475 7646122 Since high school, he<br />won't ever go away.
7646146 7649250 And I've just tried<br />to be nice to him.
7649274 7650904 Answer his letters.
7651151 7653151 Keep him calm.
7654571 7656031 Oh, my God.
7656656 7658300 I've encouraged him.
7658324 7660124 You can't blame yourself.
7661745 7663915 He pushed inside.
7665498 7667538 And he grabbed me.
7668251 7671341 But I got away, and<br />ran to the kitchen.
7671671 7673381 And he clubbed me.
7673840 7675276 I collapsed.
7675300 7679363 That club was actually the handle<br />to a punch and Judy puppet.
7679387 7680807 Right.
7681723 7683143 Treasure hunt.
7685060 7687121 I'd hidden some<br />puppets at go's...
7687145 7688865 then how did desi<br />have that handle?
7690732 7692652 I'd just found it.
7693401 7695821 It must have fallen off.
7697739 7701427 I was holding it when desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7701451 7702678 About that woodshed...
7702702 7704372 He took me to his lake house.
7704954 7706682 Tied me to his bed.
7706706 7709268 Back to the woodshed real quick.<br />Real quick.
7709292 7711145 When you went to place<br />the puppets there...
7711169 7712569 Did you notice that<br />it was packed...
7712587 7713773 lots of stuff.
7713797 7718235 Corresponding to purchases made on<br />credit cards in your husband's name.
7718259 7719779 Nick and credit cards.
7719803 7722365 He buys, I nag. I<br />don't know, probably.
7722389 7725179 He hid a lot of stuff at go's.<br />They're very close.
7725725 7730081 Now, may I go back to where I<br />was being held prisoner...
7730105 7732875 By a man with a history<br />of mental problems?
7732899 7733980 Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
7738279 7740359 Desi assaulted me that night.
7741324 7743164 Every night.
7744285 7746695 He tied me up like a dog.
7748081 7750581 And then, he'd punish me.
7752502 7754552 Starve me.
7755839 7757759 Shave me.
7759384 7761344 Sodomize me.
7762137 7763990 There were cameras everywhere.
7764014 7766974 Please find this.<br />Please find the tapes.
7768643 7771853 She slit his throat<br />with a box cutter.
7772939 7775167 How did she manage to get<br />a hold of a box cutter...
7775191 7777781 If he had her tied<br />up the whole time?
7778737 7780777 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7781573 7783551 Amy, we found your diary.
7783575 7787680 It contains many concerning allegations<br />of mental and physical abuse.
7787704 7790584 Well, it's the ugly truth.
7791416 7792916 Nick didn't want a baby.
7794753 7798053 He has a temper.<br />We had money problems.
7798965 7800109 But I love him.
7800133 7801883 Then why did you<br />try to buy a gun?
7803845 7805948 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7805972 7807825 If I could just<br />clarify one thing...
7807849 7811078 if this case had been left in<br />your deeply incompetent hands...
7811102 7812982 My husband would<br />be on death row...
7813271 7817021 And I'd be tied,<br />still, spread-eagle...
7817317 7820987 Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.<br />We're finished.
7821863 7824050 Now, I have to ask you...
7824074 7826914 Do you feel safe going<br />home with your husband?
7839339 7841984 We prayed to God, and God<br />has answered our prayers.
7842008 7843402 Amy Dunne is home.
7843426 7845529 Now, I know there are a lot<br />of questions and concerns...
7845553 7847573 But for right now, we<br />wanna sit tight...
7847597 7852517 And just be thankful and grateful for<br />this miracle on the Mississippi.
7859984 7861784 Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.
7913538 7914748 We love you, Amy!
7919377 7921230 All right, you can<br />stop pretending now.
7921254 7922924 I'm not pretending.
7923631 7925341 You were perfect.
7925967 7928529 The Nick I saw on TV, that's<br />the Nick I fell in love with.
7928553 7931282 You do know I was just telling you<br />what you wanted to hear, right?
7931306 7933159 That's how well you know me.
7933183 7935813 You know me in your marrow.
7936811 7938414 Okay.
7938438 7941768 You need to tell me<br />exactly what happened.
7943068 7944318 Take off your clothes.
7944819 7948029 I need to make sure you're<br />not wearing a wire.
7961336 7965358 You killed someone, Amy.<br />You're a murderer.
7965382 7966984 I'm a fighter.
7967008 7969487 I fought my way back to you.
7969511 7971364 You killed a guy.
7971388 7973366 You slashed his throat<br />with a box cutter.
7973390 7978060 You went on national television and<br />begged for me to save your life.
7978645 7979914 And I obliged.
7979938 7981398 But I want that Nick.
7981731 7983167 I'm leaving.
7983191 7985821 You really think that's smart?
7986486 7987486 Shampoo.
7990198 7994136 Wounded, raped wife battles her<br />way back to her husband...
7994160 7996055 And he deserts her.
7996079 7997119 They'll destroy you.
7997872 7999392 Neighbors will shun you.
7999416 8003626 And I'll make sure that no one<br />forgets the pain you caused me.
8005714 8010804 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8011386 8013006 Once they go...
8013824 8014824 I go.
8014848 8018268 Give it the night. Sleep on it.
8035118 8036698 Was there ever a baby?
8036995 8039085 There can be.
8043084 8044094 Good night.
8097013 8098683 Hey, Nick!
8110819 8112069 Hello, handsome.
8115198 8116948 Crepe?
8117594 8118594 Sure.
8118618 8120346 She was his dream girl.
8120370 8123808 And when this spoiled, rich, entitled<br />little boy couldn't have her...
8123832 8125212 He took her.
8132590 8133930 You must be so proud.
8141182 8143182 It's been four hours.
8143685 8146525 Nick? Nick? What's<br />next for you and Amy?
8150692 8153532 Right now, it's all<br />about our marriage.
8154362 8157883 When two people love each other<br />and can't make that work...
8157907 8160327 That's the real tragedy.
8164080 8166120 Kiss my cheek.
8172464 8175276 I can't believe that fucking<br />spider is America's sweetheart.
8175300 8177528 She told me she killed desi.
8177552 8178904 Not self-defense. Murder.
8178928 8180489 - Can't we get a wire?<br />- That's not gonna work.
8180513 8181699 She told you once before.
8181723 8184076 Yeah, because she had me strip<br />naked, and stand in the shower.
8184100 8187371 I swear, you two are the most<br />fucked-up people I've ever known.
8187395 8188855 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8189105 8190958 You and Amy under the same roof?
8190982 8192782 You should pitch that<br />as reality television.
8193401 8195796 Amy Dunne, and the miracle<br />on the Mississippi.
8195820 8198341 Nick and I have been<br />through some bad patches.
8198365 8199717 We've had our dark days.
8199741 8201581 But we thank you so much...
8202077 8206617 For supporting us in our new life<br />together, for forgiving Nick.
8206873 8210603 Really, your encouragement<br />means the world.
8210627 8212063 She's good.
8212087 8214690 Amazing Amy and the<br />humbled husband.
8214714 8216817 The real housewives of Branson.
8216841 8217943 Take care of this guy, will you?
8217967 8219570 I can't believe you're<br />just leaving now.
8219594 8221155 You are not at risk anymore.
8221179 8222740 I'm the definition of "at risk."
8222764 8226911 You got a book deal, a lifetime<br />movie, you franchised the bar.
8226935 8227985 You may wanna thank her.
8231022 8232442 Just don't piss her off.
8233274 8234274 See you, guys.
8236403 8238089 Elvis has left Missouri.
8238113 8239215 She had to have made a mistake.
8239239 8241550 We need to check Amy's<br />story, piece by piece.
8241574 8243454 Nick, I can't do anything.
8243868 8246722 We had the national spotlight<br />on us, we stained the rug.
8246746 8248474 The case is with the<br />feds now, they're done.
8248498 8249538 That doesn't mean you<br />have to be done.
8249958 8251748 It does.
8283324 8284784 What are you doing?
8286703 8288305 Couldn't sleep.
8288329 8289329 Come on...
8289622 8291792 Let me tuck you back in.
8304471 8307101 You know you can sleep<br />with me, right?
8309184 8311287 Yeah, it's just...
8311311 8312830 I need more time.
8312854 8316404 I would never, ever hurt you.
8318193 8320671 I do need you to<br />participate, though.
8320695 8322855 I need you to do your part.
8333166 8334166 Okay.
8334918 8337772 Everything you have<br />heard about my wife...
8337796 8339190 Is a lie.
8339214 8343304 She is a calculating,<br />murderous psychopath.
8343927 8345488 And I have been complicit...
8345512 8346642 Nick!
8352310 8354497 Nick?<br />Breakfast.
8354521 8355521 Honey?
8359067 8361545 We should hold hands.
8361569 8364659 Not the entire time, but<br />on and off throughout.
8366074 8368284 "So, Nick, how does it feel<br />to have your wife back?"
8370912 8372807 "It's fantastic."
8372831 8375893 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8375917 8377627 "Fantastic" is a<br />little flippant.
8378044 8379188 "Amazing"?
8379212 8382066 I need you to admit that you<br />got the credit cards...
8382090 8385090 And that you hid all that stuff<br />at Go's and that you pushed me.
8385844 8388894 I'm gonna need those three<br />things to feel safe.
8390098 8391928 You have to own this, Nick.
8392726 8396266 Don't worry.<br />I know exactly what to say.
8397856 8399606 Nick.
8402569 8405199 What a beautiful home.
8406448 8409135 I so appreciate you giving<br />us this time, Nick.
8409159 8411345 You went on national<br />television...
8411369 8413848 And told people that<br />I murdered my wife.
8413872 8415141 I go where the story goes.
8415165 8418144 You implied that I had carnal<br />relations with my sister.
8418168 8421731 I didn't use the "I" word.<br />I said you two were "extremely close."
8421755 8426435 You and a panel of nitwits<br />diagnosed me as a sociopath.
8427635 8429385 Ice-breaker.
8433099 8434910 To go with your robot dog.
8434934 8436984 I'll go find Amy.
8439022 8441112 She's downstairs.
8443610 8445254 - What is it?<br />- It's for you.
8445278 8446698 Open it.
8446988 8448758 I don't need any<br />more gifts from you.
8448782 8450492 Open it.
8463046 8464732 I didn't touch you.
8464756 8465816 You didn't need to.
8465840 8469070 Bullshit. That<br />notice of disposal.
8469094 8470613 I have that. You threw it out.
8470637 8472467 The notice, yes.
8472847 8473847 I want a blood test.
8474265 8475345 I want a paternity test.
8476142 8477495 I love tests.
8477519 8479372 You can teach those people<br />to hate me all you want.
8479396 8482106 I don't care. I am leaving you.
8484234 8486962 I won't have to teach<br />your child to hate you.
8486986 8489382 He'll do that all by himself.
8489406 8491276 You fucking cunt!
8493159 8495554 I'm the cunt you married.
8495578 8497390 The only time you<br />liked yourself...
8497414 8501102 Was when you were trying to be<br />someone this cunt might like.
8501126 8504586 I'm not a quitter.<br />I'm that cunt.
8508341 8511591 I've killed for you.<br />Who else can say that?
8512846 8515408 You think you would be happy<br />with a nice midwestern girl?
8515432 8518285 No way, baby. I'm it.
8518309 8521747 Look, you're delusional.<br />You're insane.
8521771 8523271 Why would you even want this?
8523648 8524750 Yes, I loved you.
8524774 8528254 And then all we did was resent each<br />other, and try to control each other.
8528278 8529318 And cause each other pain.
8529821 8531611 That's marriage.
8534284 8536664 Now, I'm getting ready.
8561978 8565082 I can't watch you play house with<br />that thing for the next 18 years.
8565106 8566792 I can't just walk away.
8566816 8568419 You could get custody.
8568443 8572340 No, I won't. And you know it.
8572364 8574874 It's gonna be my child.<br />I'm not gonna leave it.
8575492 8577303 You wanna stay.
8577327 8581265 I have a responsibility. It's<br />not about what I want anymore.
8581289 8582539 You wanna stay with her.
8593176 8594216 You're breaking my heart.
8594678 8598324 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8598348 8600868 I need you with me on this.
8600892 8603352 Of course I'm with you.
8605980 8609980 I was with you before<br />we were even born.
8611736 8614526 We've been through the darkness.
8615073 8618373 We've come out, united.
8621371 8623541 We communicate.
8625834 8628354 We're honest with each other.
8628378 8629878 Right?
8631798 8634298 We're partners in crime.
8637679 8638679 And?
8640390 8641720 And?
8645228 8647148 We're gonna be parents.
8648857 8650477 My goodness!
8650900 8652860 - How exciting!<br />- Thank you.
8657657 8660027 "What are you thinking?"
8662871 8665081 "How are you feeling?"
8667042 8669672 "What have we done<br />to each other?"
8671254 8673344 "What will we do?"
