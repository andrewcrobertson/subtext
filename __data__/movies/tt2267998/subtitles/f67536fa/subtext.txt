983441 986285 So, she's always got<br />a book in her hand.
987361 988704 Well, days can get long.

1000249 1001592 We cannot keep up<br />with the drug violence.
1001792 1004090 I'm pretty sure<br />that's not it.

1005922 1007048 Um...
1008090 1009262 No, not really.
1009425 1011268 No friends?<br />This whole town?
1011427 1014931 She was very close with my<br />mom, before she passed away.
1015097 1017217 You know, we have a pretty<br />serious homeless problem...
1017266 1018392 in our neighborhood.
1018726 1020486 I think maybe you guys<br />should check that out.

1022813 1025316 You got to The Bar<br />around 11:00 today.

1027026 1028027 Well, I was home.
1028110 1030613 I left at 9:30,<br />I got a cup of coffee,<br />a newspaper.
1030780 1032380 I went to Sawyer Beach<br />and read the news.
1032448 1034496 Did you visit<br />with anyone there?
1034659 1036627 I kind of go to Sawyer Beach<br />for the solitude.
1037787 1040256 So, your wife has<br />no friends here.
1040414 1042132 Is she kinda standoffish?
1042291 1044589 Ivy League?<br />Rubs people the wrong way?
1044752 1046971 She's from New York.<br />Oh.
1047421 1050550 She's complicated.<br />She's got<br />very high standards.
1050633 1051634 Type A?
1051968 1054437 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1054595 1056063 You seem pretty laid-back.

1057473 1059646 Speaking of which,<br />Amy's blood type?
1060184 1061857 God, I don't know. I'd have<br />to look it up at the house.

3448028 3449325 Hello?<br />(DOOR SHUTS)
3450072 3451415 Hello?
3451490 3452490 Fuck.
3452532 3453909 You scared me.<br />Want a drink?
3454076 3455453 Did you know<br />she was pregnant?
3455619 3457621 I told you, Noelle Hawthorne<br />is fucking crazy.
3457788 3458835 She doesn't even know Amy.
3459498 3461098 They look like pretty<br />good friends to me.
3462918 3463919 (DOOR CLOSES)
3468674 3470392 Look, I don't know.
3470467 3471969 But it certainly doesn't prove<br />that she's pregnant.
3472135 3473227 We have her<br />medical records coming.
3473387 3475139 Good. So, let's<br />talk while we wait.
3475305 3477399 Let's start over here.<br />The scene of the crime.
3477557 3480310 You see, we've seen dozens<br />of home invasions.
3480477 3482320 Dozens and dozens.
3482479 3484573 This area right here, it looked<br />wrong from the second we saw it.
3484731 3487905 The whole thing looked staged.<br />Watch this.
3489820 3493245 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3493657 3495284 I don't know. What do<br />you want me to say?
3495367 3497040 Did you do any housekeeping the<br />day your wife went missing?
3497119 3500248 No. Because our guys<br />did a luminol test.
3500414 3502963 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3503125 3505253 Amy lost a lot of blood<br />in there, Nick. A lot.
3505335 3506336 Oh, my God.
3506420 3507637 Yeah, and then<br />somebody mopped it up.
3507796 3510140 Oh... Wait a second. Why would<br />they mop up the blood...
3510298 3511898 if they're trying to stage<br />a crime scene?
3511925 3514553 No blood and no body<br />suggests kidnapping.
3514720 3517018 It tells us, look at<br />people outside the house.
3517180 3518477 Like these homeless<br />you keep mentioning.
3518640 3521610 A pool of blood and no<br />body suggests homicide.
3521768 3523645 It tells us to look at<br />people inside the house.
3523812 3525314 Which is what<br />we're doing here, Nick.
3525397 3526398 I see.
3526565 3528192 BONEY: So, how was<br />your marriage, Nick?
3528275 3529401 Because right now,<br />all we got is Noelle.
3529568 3530990 She says, "Not good."
3531153 3532530 Gil, what do you<br />and your wife argue about?
3532696 3534698 What pisses you off?<br />Oh, money, lack thereof.
3534865 3536492 BONEY: Me and my ex,<br />it's the same.
3536658 3539878 I mention that because we got a<br />look at your finances, Nick.
3540037 3542631 $117,000<br />in credit card debt.
3542789 3544632 What? I pulled up some<br />of the merchandise.
3544791 3546668 There are these<br />fun little splurges.
3546835 3548275 NICK: I didn't buy<br />any of this stuff.
3548420 3549421 I don't even golf!
3549588 3550805 I do!<br />You bought great clubs.
3550964 3552136 I like the robot dog.
3552299 3554142 This is identity theft!<br />This is a felony!
3554217 3555218 We need to find out<br />who did this!
3555302 3556982 All right. Let's talk<br />about life insurance.
3557095 3559518 Because in April, you bumped<br />up Amy's life insurance...
3559639 3560640 to $1.2 million.
3560724 3562977 Yes, I did. That was her idea.<br />She wanted me to.
3563143 3564190 You filed the paperwork.
3564352 3565729 Because she told me to!<br />Whoa!
3565812 3567189 (PHONE RINGING)<br />Hold on a sec.
3567355 3569153 Yeah? Okay.
3571068 3572240 For sure?
3572652 3573824 All right.<br />(DISCONNECTS)
3574488 3576035 (INDISTINCT CLAMORING OUTSIDE)
3577824 3578871 She was pregnant.
3582996 3584498 This is insane.
3584664 3587042 So, my question becomes...
3587209 3590008 I don't want to talk<br />to you again, ever...
3590170 3591342 without a lawyer.
3599679 3600680 MALE REPORTER: Margo!
3600764 3602107 (OVERLAPPING SHOUTING)
3611566 3612567 Hey-
3614945 3617198 NICK: Just hold on a second.<br />Let me finish.
3617280 3618281 Nick?
3618365 3621039 NICK: I hear you, I hear you.<br />I was as surprised as...
3621201 3625047 I know you're upset. I had<br />no idea she was pregnant.
3625455 3628584 Listen, I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't...
3631086 3633088 You want to<br />know the truth?
3633255 3635633 The truth is,<br />Amy didn't want kids.
3638051 3640099 Well, I'm as surprised as...
3641429 3643227 You told me<br />you didn't want kids.
3643598 3645475 (SIGHS) I was trying<br />to put a good face on.
3645642 3647394 Then, suddenly,<br />you've got a pregnant wife.
3647561 3648778 That's a problem for you.
3648937 3651907 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3652065 3653408 Oh, stop watching<br />Ellen Abbott!
3653567 3654910 You have to<br />fucking talk to me!
3657571 3659915 I didn't tell you that<br />she didn't want kids...
3659990 3661492 because she didn't<br />want me to.
3661658 3662659 Because it would<br />have just been...
3662742 3663743 another reason<br />for you to hate her.
3663910 3665662 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just...
3665829 3667923 Lie to me?<br />I wanted kids!
3668081 3670241 When we first moved here,<br />I went to a fertility clinic!
3670292 3671839 It didn't work?<br />I did my part!
3671918 3672919 Masturbate.<br />When it came time...
3673003 3674755 for Amy to do her thing,<br />all of a sudden it was like...
3674838 3676398 "Well, I don't know.<br />Maybe. No, thanks."
3676423 3678425 Now, who would believe you?
3679593 3680810 All right.
3684681 3685773 (SCOFFS)
3690437 3692110 This is a letter<br />from the clinic...
3692272 3694616 notifying me that they're<br />gonna destroy my sample...
3694774 3696776 unless I contact them.
3698028 3699450 So, I gave it to Amy.
3699613 3702492 The next day,<br />I saw it in the trash.
3702657 3704125 But you were already with<br />Andie by then, right?
3704284 3707003 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3707162 3708880 A year ago,<br />Amy being pregnant...
3708955 3711333 would have been<br />the best thing ever!
3717881 3719633 "When your poor Amy has a<br />cold, this dessert just..."
3719799 3721199 This is the clue<br />you couldn't solve.
3721218 3722344 Yeah.
3724054 3725601 A letter from Desi.
3725680 3727307 That creepy boyfriend<br />of Amy's?
3727474 3729755 It was the fucking rich guy who<br />would do anything for her.
3729893 3731736 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3731853 3732854 Your prenup?
3733230 3734777 Nick, why have<br />you kept this stuff?
3734856 3736073 It's like<br />a little box of hate.
3736233 3738031 I don't know, Go!<br />Maybe I hate her!
3740904 3743908 I love you no matter what.
3744074 3745326 But you need to tell me.
3745492 3746914 Tell you what?
3747744 3749371 What are you asking me?
3750956 3754130 Are you asking me<br />if I killed my wife, Go?
3754584 3756664 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3756711 3759134 I would never<br />ask you that!
3763093 3764094 ALL REPORTERS: Margo!

3784906 3785907 (SIGHS)
3801256 3802849 BONEY: Why was<br />he here that night?
3804467 3807141 His wife is missing.<br />Why come here?
3807220 3808267 (SIGHS) Who cares?
3808555 3809681 Rhonda, we got this.
3809848 3811225 Let's make the arrest.
3811391 3813314 Do you know how hard it is to make<br />a murder case without a body?
3813393 3814394 No.
3814477 3816525 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3816688 3819441 So, I want one last thing.
3819524 3820525 What's that?
3822235 3824533 I want a body.
3825697 3829998 <i>AMY: Picture me,<br />I'm a girl who's<br />very, very bad.</i>

4270516 4273645 <i>I drank canned beer<br />watching Adam Sandier movies.</i>
4273895 4276523 <i>I ate cold pizza<br />and remained a size two.</i>

4280026 4281369 <i>I lived in the moment.</i>
4281652 4284201 <i>I was fucking game.</i>
4284822 4286870 <i>I can't say<br />I didn't enjoy some of it.</i>
4287700 4290874 <i>Nick teased out of me<br />things I didn't know existed.</i>
4291037 4294211 <i>A lightness,<br />a humor, an ease.</i>
4294373 4297172 <i>But I made him smarter.<br />Sharper.</i>
4297335 4300839 <i>I inspired him to<br />rise to my level.</i>

4453699 4457875 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4458037 4460381 I couldn't fake it for<br />another year, another day.
4460539 4461586 Then what happened?
4461666 4462758 Before I could say anything,<br />she said...
4462833 4466087 "I need you to go somewhere and<br />really think about our marriage."

4468881 4471100 She stage-managed me.
4471384 4474934 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4475096 4476518 I went to the beach,<br />I thought about our marriage.
4476681 4478361 I came back and decided<br />I wanted a divorce.
4478432 4479632 And by the time<br />you got home...
4479684 4481231 She was gone.
4481602 4482603 Oh, you fuck!
4482770 4484363 She's good.

4978515 4980017 We click. She's perfect.
4980184 4982403 She's beautiful,<br />she's smart,<br />she's well-read...
4982561 4984734 she's got an ass<br />like a 20-year-old stripper.
4984897 4986570 I think,<br />"What's the catch?"
4986732 4989906 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4990569 4993493 Girls like a fixer-upper,<br />but Amy?
4993655 4997000 She annexed me.<br />She made me her business.
4997159 5000834 It was just too much. She<br />went out and bought me ties.
5000996 5003090 And we must have gone<br />20 rounds over that.
5003248 5005876 Ties. The whole thing<br />just became...
5006043 5007340 So, you broke up with her.
5007419 5009717 No, I just backed away.
5009880 5012554 Gave her some space.<br />No big deal, right?
5012716 5014263 So I thought.
5014426 5016599 Then one night, Amy comes<br />over to my place...
5016762 5019561 with a bottle of bourbon<br />and a bootleg of<br />this band I love.
5019723 5022602 And within two minutes,<br />she's got my pants<br />around my ankles...
5022768 5024236 and she is<br />kneeling down, and...
5024394 5026271 I'm sorry.<br />I know it's your wife.
5026438 5028190 You had sex?<br />Yeah, consensual.
5028357 5030451 It was rough, but she<br />was screaming for it.
5030901 5033245 Next morning, there's<br />two cops at my door.
5033570 5036369 Amy has wounds that<br />are consistent with rape.
5036532 5039581 Ligature marks on her<br />wrist, and my semen.
5039743 5043293 It looks like I've tied Amy<br />to my bed, and raped her.
5043455 5044798 Me!
5044957 5046584 And then,<br />guess what they find.
5046750 5048798 Headboards of my bed,<br />one on each side.
5049211 5050428 The ties you wouldn't wear.

5315393 5316861 Hey-
5322400 5323447 Mr. Dunne.
5323527 5324528 Mr. Collings.
5325529 5328499 I know you.<br />I saw you at<br />the volunteer center.
5328657 5330375 I wanted to help.
5331159 5332759 Well, I hope you don't<br />mind me coming by.
5332911 5336006 I got your address<br />from this letter<br />that you wrote my wife.
5336873 5340252 Amy and I believe in the<br />lost art of letter-writing.
5340418 5344264 I always wondered why you<br />kept in touch<br />after...
5344923 5346095 everything.
5346258 5348556 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5348718 5350766 She was my first<br />serious girlfriend.
5350929 5352272 Why did you break up?
5352347 5353599 That's a strange question.
5353765 5355608 Did you treat her bad?<br />Did you cheat on her?
5355767 5356859 That's a rude question.
5357018 5358611 Let me tell you<br />what Amy told me.
5358770 5361614 She dumped you,<br />you completely unraveled.
5361773 5363741 You stalked her,<br />you threatened her...
5363900 5367279 and you attempted<br />suicide in her bed<br />and were institutionalized.
5367445 5371245 Your wife is missing,<br />and you came all this<br />way to tell me this?
5371408 5373627 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.

5422083 5424085 Why did he go to his<br />dad's house to burn it?
5424252 5425253 It's private.<br />There's no one there.
5425420 5428094 Why didn't he make sure<br />it actually burned?
5428256 5431100 Because he tripped the alarm.<br />You were up his ass<br />with a flashlight.

5487482 5488699 And she leaves<br />a pair of red panties.
5488858 5489905 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5490068 5491661 Clue two.<br />My father's house.

5493029 5494076 would occasionally<br />have relations.
5494239 5495491 Clue three?<br />Woodshed.
5495657 5497034 Also a location...<br />Oh, my God.
5497200 5498827 We had limited options.<br />A hotel.
5498994 5500166 Amy would have seen<br />the credit card bill.

5518054 5521604 for the sake of his<br />children's safety,<br />had to deny their existence.
5521766 5523188 You never told me that.

5559095 5560312 Okay. Amy's parents?
5560472 5561940 No, it's...<br />More pressure.

5572817 5573818 Really?
5573985 5576158 Right now,<br />Andie just gives<br />you another motive.
5576988 5578160 We need to tell the cops<br />about the woodshed.
5578448 5579745 We need to be on<br />the front end of that.
5579908 5582252 But I'm gonna warn you<br />as to what will happen.

5585121 5586919 She's your accomplice.<br />She helped you<br />hide the evidence.

6037240 6039618 For a while,<br />things had been building up.
6039784 6043163 "Built up" implies that an<br />explosion is coming. No.
6043329 6045752 At a certain point,<br />we got on the wrong track.
6046582 6048084 I had a moment of weakness.
6048251 6050674 Your "moment"<br />was over 15 months.
6054465 6056559 I disrespected my wife.
6057218 6059641 And I disrespected<br />my marriage.
6060096 6061473 And I'll always regret it.
6061973 6063020 That works.
6063099 6065397 Don't be afraid to<br />play up the dufus<br />husband thing, Nick.

6131542 6135297 I threatened to leave,<br />and he said he'd find me...
6135379 6136722 and he'd kill me.
6137048 6139221 So, I disappeared.
6140384 6142227 (VOICE BREAKING)<br />I lost the baby.

6151062 6152905 He showed up on my doorstep<br />three days ago.
6153064 6155567 He tracked me from<br />my letters to you.
6156692 6157909 You saved them.
6158486 6159487 Knowing you were out there...
6159570 6162073 was the only thing that's kept<br />me going these past few years.

6163658 6164830 No, I can't turn up now.
6164992 6168087 I'd be a pariah.<br />Everyone would hate me.
6169914 6172087 Is it wrong to want<br />Nick to go prison?

6871031 6873125 I usually ignore<br />tipline calls...
6873283 6875160 but a neighbor<br />was concerned about...
6875243 6877871 a strange man<br />around your woodshed.
6878246 6879246 Call Tanner.
6879289 6880461 Okay. Fuck!
6884586 6886054 Girlfriend's real cute,<br />Nick.
6887297 6888377 Is that what this is about?
6889800 6891768 I have treated<br />you more than fair...
6891843 6894437 throughout this<br />entire investigation.
6894596 6896769 I gave you the benefit of<br />the doubt over and over.
6896932 6898452 Every time you said<br />something stupid...
6898475 6900728 I thought,<br />"Maybe he's just stupid."

6930507 6932225 What can I do to help?
6932926 6934348 I need some time to think.
6934511 6935763 That's the last<br />thing you need.
6935846 6936893 Desi...
6937055 6939524 Twenty years,<br />you have kept me dangling.

6968920 6970922 I've been so mistreated<br />for so long.
6973592 6976471 I've forgotten how to behave.

7030941 7032943 Yes. It's Amy's<br />anniversary present to me.
7033109 7034782 Was that how she told you<br />she was pregnant, Nick?

7037948 7039120 No.
7040367 7042327 Recognize this? Never seen<br />that before in my life.
7042702 7045956 It's Amy's diary.<br />We found this at<br />your father's house.
7047958 7049198 Is this your<br />wife's handwriting?

7089791 7090838 Sure.

7658818 7660616 You can't blame yourself.

7665992 7668040 And he grabbed me.
7668744 7671839 But I got away,<br />and ran to the kitchen.
7672165 7673883 And he clubbed me.
7674333 7675630 I collapsed.
7675793 7679718 That club was actually the handle<br />to a Punch and Judy puppet.
7679881 7681303 Right.

7685553 7687476 I'd hidden some<br />puppets at Go's...
7687638 7689356 Then how did Desi<br />have that handle?
7691225 7693148 I'd just found it.
7693895 7696318 It must have fallen off.
7696439 7697440 I...
7698232 7701782 was holding it<br />when Desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.

8141675 8143677 It's been four hours.
8144178 8147022 Nick? Nick? What's next<br />for you and Amy?
8151185 8154029 Right now,<br />it's all about our marriage.
8154855 8158234 When two people<br />love each other and<br />can't make that work...
8158400 8160823 that's the real tragedy.

8179421 8180843 GO: Can't we get a wire?<br />NICK: That's not gonna work.
8181006 8182053 She told you once before.
8182216 8184435 Yeah, because she<br />had me strip naked,<br />and stand in the shower.
8184593 8187722 I swear, you two are<br />the most fucked-up people<br />I've ever known.
8187888 8189356 And I specialize<br />in fucked-up.

8409651 8411699 You went on<br />national television...
8411862 8414206 and told people that<br />I murdered my wife.
8414364 8415490 I go where the story goes.
8415657 8418501 You implied that I<br />had carnal relations<br />with my sister.
8418660 8422085 I didn't use the "I" word.<br />I said you two were<br />"extremely close."
8422247 8426923 You and a panel of nitwits<br />diagnosed me as a sociopath.
