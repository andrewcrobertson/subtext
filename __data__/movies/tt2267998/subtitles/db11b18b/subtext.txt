23774 24775 <i>When I think of my wife...</i>
27195 29697 <i>...I always think of her head.</i>
31157 33951 <i>I picture cracking her lovely skull...</i>
34118 36245 <i>unspooling her brains...</i>
36412 39040 <i>trying to get answers.</i>
40249 43628 <i>The primal questions of any marriage.</i>
43794 46005 <i>"What are you thinking?"</i>
46172 48299 <i>"How are you feeling?"</i>
48466 51093 <i>"What have we done to each other?"</i>
146063 150067 The Irish prince<br />graces us with his presence.
151736 154864 His majesty prefers not to be moistened.
156073 157366 I got you a present.
158951 160286 - I hated this game.<br />- You loved it.
160453 161620 You loved it.
161787 164081 Thank you.<br />I'll add it to the collection.
164874 167043 Can you pour me a bourbon?
173299 175384 What's up, Jitters?
179096 181307 Well, if you're not going to talk,<br />I'm gonna have to fill the silence...
181474 184727 with another excruciating story<br />by Margo Dunne.
184894 187438 I could tell you about<br />my recent customer service experience...
187605 189482 - changing Internet service providers.<br />- I like that one.
189648 192401 Or how about the time I saw that woman<br />who looked exactly like my friend Monica?
192568 194362 But it wasn't Monica.<br />It was a total stranger.
194528 196447 Who was also named Monica.
196906 198407 - Made it kind of interesting.<br />- It's great.
199241 200451 I'm just having a bad day.
200618 202453 - Amy?<br />- It's our anniversary.
202620 204455 - Five years.<br />- Five?
204622 205664 That came fast.
205831 207166 And furious.
211712 214799 <i>I'm so crazy, stupid happy.</i>
217635 218969 <i>I met a boy.</i>
219136 223557 <i>A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.</i>
225810 226977 Excuse me, miss?
227144 228479 I just want you to be careful...
228646 231315 where you put down that<br />monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
231482 234068 because the party's down to three<br />Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.
234235 235820 It might attract<br />some desperate characters.
235986 238823 It could.<br />I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa.
242910 245329 They already relieved me<br />of my artisanal meat platter.
245496 248249 Finally, someone tells me<br />how to pronounce that word.
248416 249250 "Meat"?
249417 250668 Yes, "meat." One syllable.
251001 253546 Thank you. Whose beer am I<br />about to drink?
253712 255005 Don't tell me.
255673 257341 Let's see, who's your type?
257758 258717 I don't see you sitting quietly...
258884 262346 while he bloviates<br />on his postgrad thesis about Proust.
262513 264682 Uh-oh. Is that him?
264849 267059 Ironic hipster, so self-aware,<br />he makes everything a joke.
267351 270354 I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."
272189 273399 What type are you?
273566 274900 Corn-fed,<br />salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.
275067 276068 Missouri?
276235 277027 Cute.
277194 279405 - Native New Yorker?<br />- The world ends at the Hudson.
279572 280531 What's your name?
280698 281532 Amy.
281699 284034 Well, Amy, who are you?
285369 288414 A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.
288581 292626 B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.
292793 295921 C, I write personality quizzes<br />for magazines.
296297 300384 Okay. Your hands are far too delicate<br />for real scrimshaw work...
300551 303679 and I happen to be a charter subscriber<br />to <i>Middling Warlord Weekly...</i>
303846 305055 so I'd recognize you.
305389 306599 I'm gonna go with "C."
306765 308184 And you?
309018 310436 Who are you?
310603 314940 I'm the guy to save you<br />from all this awesomeness.
319028 321739 So, you write for a men's magazine.
321906 325034 God, does that make you an expert<br />on being a man?
325201 326285 No.
327077 328245 It's what to wear, what to drink.
328412 330247 How to bullshit.
330414 331874 Never with you.
332041 332750 Ha, ha.
332917 334418 No, I mean it.
334585 336253 It's hard to believe you.
336420 337087 Why?
337254 338756 I think it's your chin.
338923 339924 My chin?
340090 342635 Yeah, it's quite villainous.
342801 344428 Okay, how's this?
345429 348599 A hundred percent true, no bullshit.
348974 349808 Okay.
349975 351435 <i>We all move to New York...</i>
351602 355606 and we end up living in these little<br />cubby holes, and that's not it.
355773 359235 Come outside. Then, you're in it.
361654 363405 You have to see this.
371956 372957 Hey.
373082 374041 Hey.
383050 384677 I have to kiss you now.
384843 386136 Is that right?
386303 389473 I can't let you go through<br />a sugar storm unkissed.
391308 392476 Wait a second.
395187 396647 There you go.
408576 409994 Nick Dunne...
411745 413831 I really like you.
420004 422256 So, is Amy gonna do<br />one of those anniversary...
423215 424383 treasure hunts?
424550 426427 You mean the forced march<br />designed to prove...
426594 429430 what an oblivious and uncaring asshole<br />her husband is?
429597 430681 Wow.
433517 435102 Life. I don't remember the point.
435269 437354 Deep Hasbro thoughts.
437521 438856 Spin.
439690 441775 What was the clue last year<br />she got so mad about?
441942 445112 "When your poor Amy has a cold...
445279 446864 "this dessert just must be sold."
447031 447865 The answer?
448032 449700 I still don't know the answer, Go.
449867 451910 - A few years ago, you'd have known.<br />- A few years ago, it was fun.
452077 453621 Year one,<br />the traditional gift was paper.
453787 457124 She got me a beautiful notebook.<br />Told me to go write my novel.
457291 458042 What did you get her?
458208 459460 A kite.
459627 461462 - She'd never flown a kite.<br />- Okay.
462421 464882 Anyway. Year four, flowers.
465049 468302 She led me outside<br />to the dying rosebush in the backyard.
468636 469553 That's symbolic.
469720 470554 Yeah.
470721 472056 What's the gift for five?
472222 472890 Wood.
473057 475392 - So, what did you get her?<br />- There's no good gift for wood.
475559 478771 I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,<br />slap her with your penis.
478937 480397 "There's some wood for you, bitch."
483942 485235 The Bar.
485986 488280 Why, yes. Hang on one second.
488447 489615 Hey, it's Watchful Wally.
491909 493911 Hey, Walt. What's going on?
496288 499375 Thanks very much. I'll be right there.<br />All right, bye-bye.
511595 514264 Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?
515474 516975 Thanks, Walt!
532658 534034 Ame?
554388 555848 Amy!
568527 569194 Hello?
569695 571155 Come on in.
571905 572573 Hey.
572740 574032 - Mister Dunne.<br />- Hi.
574199 576577 I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.<br />This is Officer James Gilpin.
576744 578579 We understand there are concerns<br />about your wife.
578746 582666 I don't know where my wife is.<br />And I came home to this.
583709 586503 Now, I don't panic easily...
586837 588922 but it's weird, right?
590174 591175 Mind if we look around?
591425 592217 Please.
592384 593510 How long have you two been here?
593677 596388 Two years in September.<br />We used to live in New York.
596555 597514 City?
597681 600684 Yeah, I was a writer.<br />We were both writers.
600851 602352 Why did you all move back here?
602519 604021 My mom got sick.
604188 607024 Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?
607191 608525 She's dead.
608692 609693 I'm so sorry.
615407 617701 What do you do now, for work?
618577 620412 My sister Margo and I<br />own The Bar downtown.
620871 622581 Oh, The Bar.
622748 624875 Love the name. Very meta.
625042 626126 Thanks.
629087 630881 Pretty things.
635636 636845 Stay.
637012 638764 My office, here.
641809 643852 Beautiful dress.
647856 648524 Date night?
648690 649942 It's our anniversary.
653111 654613 It's a guest bedroom, there.
654905 656406 Cat's room on the end.
656573 658116 I checked up here.
662496 663455 This is the kitchen...
663622 664957 obviously.
680722 682432 This is my wife's office.
682599 684226 Amy's office.
697281 700284 Wow. Impressive gal.
700367 701451 Yeah. Should I be concerned?
701618 702786 I remember these.
704037 705289 I loved these books.
709459 710752 Wait a minute.
710919 712921 Your wife is Amazing Amy?
713505 715716 Yeah. She is.
715883 717509 Wow.
720512 724016 <i>Amazing-fucking-Amy<br />is getting fucking married.</i>
724182 725851 <i>That's how the night started.</i>
726018 732065 <i>With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br />jealous, as always, of the golden child.</i>
732149 736737 <i>Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,<br />who's getting fucking married.</i>
737070 738739 When I was 10, I quit cello.
738906 742492 In the next book,<br />Amazing Amy became a prodigy.
744953 745746 Did you play volleyball?
745996 747748 I got cut, freshman year.
747915 749833 She made varsity.
751251 753128 When did you have a dog?
753295 754296 She got the dog.
754922 757299 Puddles made her more relatable.
757466 758675 Wow.
758842 760844 I love your parents...
761011 762679 but they really can be assholes.
762846 764181 - Nick!<br />- Sir!
764348 766016 Hey, thanks for coming, man.
766183 766850 No problem.
767017 768435 Hey, sweetheart.
769019 770312 Big night for your mom.
770479 774191 It would mean so much<br />if you would talk to a few reporters...
774358 776109 bloggers, give them a little Amy color.
776276 778028 People wanna hear from you.
778195 779696 - We can't stay long.<br />- Fantastic.
779863 782032 Fifteen minutes, tops.
782366 786536 This is why I have my brownstone.<br />My trust fund. I know I can't complain.
786703 789206 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
789373 793293 No, they improved upon it,<br />and then peddled it to the masses.
793460 795545 I thought you were gonna wear white<br />to match the wedding theme.
795712 797047 I thought that would be creepy.
797214 799549 "If it's worth doing,<br />it's worth doing..."
799716 801927 Hold up! I know how this ends.<br />Don't tell me.
802094 803762 You're very cute, Nick.
803929 805430 Amy, you know<br />what would make Dad's night.
805597 807224 I'm on it.
808517 811395 I love having strangers<br />pick at my scabs.
811561 812688 <i>I'm curious whether...</i>
812854 814564 it's difficult for you to see<br />Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
815190 817901 And this big party<br />celebrating this fictional wedding.
818068 820278 Because it's my understanding<br />you are not married.
820445 822114 Is that correct?
823073 826702 Correct. Amazing Amy has always been<br />one step ahead of me.
826868 830706 Excuse me. I'm sorry,<br />I just have a few questions.
831081 831873 It's you.
832040 834584 I'm here in a<br />strictly journalistic capacity.
834876 838088 Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br />of dating Nick Dunne for how long?
838255 840924 - Two magical years.<br />- Two magical years.
841091 842801 In the course of that time,<br />you've had the opportunity...
842968 845303 to perform such gracious gestures as...
845470 849266 not correcting Nick when he<br />pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
849433 850767 An understandable mistake.
850934 851977 He also thought it was a fish.
852144 853729 He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.
854771 856940 You also manage to appear<br />shocked and delighted...
857107 859568 when Nick's elderly mother<br />breaks into an impromptu rendition...
859735 861820 of <i>New York, New York,</i><br />every time she sees you.
861987 863905 <i>These bag of bone shoes</i>
864072 865115 That's just frightening.
865282 867784 You also bought Nick<br />his very first pair of scissors.
867951 869494 And matching stapler.
869661 872456 Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.
872622 876001 You are brilliant,<br />yet entirely un-snobby.
876168 879671 You challenge me. You surprise me.
879838 881173 And, fun fact for the readers...
881590 883300 you have a world-class vagina.
886094 888430 My colleagues tell me<br />that you are not yet married.
888972 890640 Is that correct?
890807 892142 I'm not.
892309 893643 Isn't it time we fixed that?
895103 896646 <i>And then...</i>
896813 899649 <i>the night wasn't so bad anymore.</i>
915999 918376 And it's done. Crossed off the list.
918543 922380 Now, normally, we would not treat this<br />as a missing persons case so quick...
922547 923840 but given the scene at your house...
924007 926009 and given our spike<br />in violent crime of late...
926176 928512 we are gonna take this<br />very, very seriously.
928678 929513 Okay. Good.
929679 932849 We've got forensics over at your place.<br />You got somewhere to stay?
933016 934476 - I could stay at my sister's.<br />- Okay.
934643 936812 We're tracking Amy's phone,<br />her credit cards.
936978 938522 We will organize searches,<br />put up flyers.
938688 941566 - We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.<br />- You're having a press conference?
941733 943193 I wanna get the word out, right?
943360 947656 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,<br />I feel like I'm on a <i>Law & Order</i> episode.
955705 957749 Time is of the essence in these cases.
957916 960544 But, that said,<br />do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?
960710 961711 Absolutely not. I just wanna help.
961878 963547 So, you and Amy<br />have been here two years.
963713 966842 - You tend bar...<br />- I own The Bar.
967008 970387 And I teach creative writing at MVCC.
970554 972222 - No kids?<br />- Not yet.
972389 973723 So, what does Amy do most days?
973890 976101 A woman with all those degrees,<br />what does she do?
976601 977894 I don't know. She keeps busy.
978061 979563 Doing what?
981773 983275 She's a voracious reader.
983441 986278 So, she's always got a book in her hand.
987362 988697 Well, days can get long.
988864 992576 I know a few housewives, that<br />evening glass of wine starts coming at noon.
992742 993910 Or prescription pills.
994077 995453 Just last week, we had a soccer mom.
995620 997956 Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in<br />over some Oxy Contin.
998123 1000083 Ever since that mall went bust,<br />half the town is out of work.
1000250 1001585 We cannot keep up<br />with the drug violence.
1001793 1004087 I'm pretty sure that's not it.
1004254 1006089 Has Amy got friends we can talk to?
1008091 1009259 No, not really.
1009426 1011261 No friends? This whole town?
1011428 1014931 She was very close with my mom,<br />before she passed away.
1015098 1016933 You know, we have a pretty serious<br />homeless problem...
1017267 1018393 in our neighborhood.
1018727 1020312 I think maybe you guys<br />should check that out.
1021771 1022647 We'll look into that.
1022814 1025317 You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.
1025483 1026943 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that out.
1027110 1027944 Well, I was home.
1028111 1030614 I left at 9:30,<br />I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.
1030780 1032282 I went to Sawyer Beach<br />and read the news.
1032449 1034492 Did you visit with anyone there?
1034659 1036620 I kind of go to Sawyer Beach<br />for the solitude.
1037787 1040248 So, your wife has no friends here.
1040415 1042125 Is she kinda standoffish?
1042292 1044586 Ivy League? Rubs people the wrong way?
1044753 1046254 She's from New York.
1047422 1050634 She's complicated.<br />She's got very high standards.
1050800 1051635 Type A?
1051968 1054429 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1054596 1057307 You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.
1057474 1059643 Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?
1060185 1061853 God, I don't know.<br />I'd have to look it up at the house.
1062020 1064689 You don't know if she has friends,<br />you don't know what she does all day...
1064856 1066650 and you don't know<br />your wife's blood type.
1066816 1067943 Sure you all are married?
1069694 1070528 Maybe it's type O.
1070695 1072781 - Where are her folks? New York?<br />- Yeah.
1072948 1074532 Can they get here time<br />for this press conference tomorrow?
1074699 1076618 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1076785 1078495 You haven't called<br />your wife's parents yet?
1078662 1080956 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1081122 1083458 Call them, please, Nick. Now.
1083625 1084834 Fine.
1090340 1092259 Should I know my wife's blood type?
1092342 1093343 No.
1093677 1097347 I apologize, Marybeth.<br />I didn't know what was going on.
1097514 1098890 Now I'm at the station...
1099057 1102560 and the cops are at the house,<br />and it's serious and I'm calling you.
1103270 1106106 There's a lot of things<br />that are being juggled right now.
1106273 1109401 I'm standing right next to<br />Detective Rhonda Boney...
1109567 1111528 who's the lead investigator on this<br />and she's...
1113780 1115949 My mother-in-law<br />would like to speak with you.
1117367 1118535 This is Detective Boney.
1118702 1119911 I wanna go home.
1120078 1122414 I don't know why I have to be here.
1122580 1125083 I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.
1125250 1126376 Dad?
1126793 1128253 This is my father. What's going on?
1128420 1129462 Really? You're Nick Dunne?
1129713 1131589 We've been trying to get a hold of you<br />all afternoon.
1131756 1133300 I've been right there.<br />My wife is missing.
1133466 1134467 - Bitch.<br />- Don't.
1134634 1136886 Your father wandered out of Comfort Hill<br />after lunch.
1137053 1139306 We found him walking Route 79,<br />disoriented.
1139472 1140807 We've been trying to call you<br />for the last...
1140974 1142100 I don't get a cell signal<br />in this building.
1142267 1144227 I've been sitting<br />20 feet away from you.
1144561 1146062 Sir, please<br />don't take that tone with me.
1146229 1147230 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.
1147397 1148940 Dad, stop.
1151609 1152819 You wanna drive him home?
1153486 1155780 I think that would be wise. Thanks.
1175342 1178428 <i>This voice mailbox is currently full.</i>

1237821 1239197 My God.
1239697 1240865 You naughty minx.
1241032 1243993 Well, technically, we are supposed<br />to fuck at the next stop.
1244160 1245662 Yeah, in keeping with tradition.
1245829 1249207 But I might be willing<br />to bend the rules this once.
1249374 1251084 God bless Jane Austen.
1266433 1270437 I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br />It's confirmed by the...
1273398 1275692 Thank you.
1276734 1278194 Year two. Cotton.
1284951 1289080 We had that joke that our sex<br />was too good for ordinary.
1289247 1291708 So, these are 2,000 thread-count...
1296754 1299549 We're so cute.<br />I wanna punch us in the face.
1299716 1302927 That's pretty great.<br />I mean, that is pretty great.
1304387 1305722 Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?
1305889 1308057 I don't need a lawyer.<br />Here, I'll do this.
1308558 1310393 Well, did they ask personal stuff<br />about Amy?
1310560 1311728 You know, they asked...
1312061 1313396 why didn't she have any friends?
1313563 1314272 What did you say?
1314439 1316441 - I said she was complicated.<br />- Nick!
1317442 1320069 Everyone knows "complicated"<br />is code for "bitch."
1325492 1327160 God. I feel sick.
1327327 1328745 Thanks.
1329746 1330914 It's so bizarre.
1331080 1333458 It seems like the kind of thing<br />that would happen to Amy.
1333625 1334667 She always attracts...
1334834 1336419 Drama?
1337253 1338505 You can say it. It's just me and you.
1338671 1341090 Just because<br />I don't like to be around Amy...
1341257 1342509 doesn't mean I don't care about her.
1345595 1347764 Anyway, whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.
1357106 1359025 Detective? Excuse me.
1359192 1361819 I'm Noelle Hawthorne.<br />I'm Amy's best friend.
1362946 1365615 Well, great. Where do you live, Noelle?
1366157 1367534 Five doors down. 1032.
1367700 1369786 Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.
1369953 1371704 Can I come by in half an hour?
1371871 1373456 - Y'all know anything yet?<br />- I'm sorry.
1373623 1376292 I got guys on the clock in here.<br />But you give me 30 minutes.
1376459 1377794 But that's usually bath time.
1378545 1381130 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.
1383883 1385051 All right. So, what do you got?
1385218 1387845 It was definitely blood spatter<br />you saw in the kitchen.
1388346 1389889 Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.
1390056 1392308 Not that weird,<br />but that is awfully high.
1392475 1393977 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.
1394143 1395311 Well, okay.
1398022 1398982 Interesting.
1399148 1400149 What's that?
1400316 1403695 House is rented in her name.<br />Car's in her name.
1403861 1406864 Credit cards, utilities,<br />phone bill, all in her name.
1407031 1408741 Even his bar's in her name.
1408908 1410702 I don't know that that's so surprising.
1410868 1412370 No. But it is humiliating.
1412537 1413329 What you got?
1413496 1416332 It's with her unmentionables.
1428678 1431556 Well, we have our first clue.
1442650 1444193 I have to take a shower.
1444360 1446029 No, don't. You've been up all night.
1446195 1448364 You wanna look<br />like you've been up all night.
1449991 1452201 Hey, be careful today, okay?
1452368 1453578 That's a weird thing to say.
1453745 1457373 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.<br />You can seem angry, like...
1457540 1458916 Please don't say, "Like Dad."
1459083 1461711 Or else you swing into your momma's-boy<br />charm offensive and that can feel glib.
1461878 1462545 Perfect.
1462712 1465340 I'll balance on the exact fucking edge<br />of your emotional razor.
1465506 1467216 Okay. Just be...

1486444 1487362 - Hi, Rand.<br />- Hey, man.
1487528 1488237 I'm Detective Boney.
1488404 1490239 I'm the twin. Margo.
1490406 1493368 We played tennis yesterday, Nick.<br />I just can't get over it.
1493534 1494744 Marybeth, I am really sorry.
1494911 1496579 I knew you never should have<br />moved back here.
1496746 1497747 We didn't have a lot of choice.
1497914 1501459 We are all worried. We are all scared.
1501626 1506089 But we are all here now.<br />And we will find Amy, together.
1516307 1518101 Should I just go first, and then<br />you guys can say something?
1518267 1519227 Good.
1520895 1525108 As you know, my wife,<br />Amy Elliott Dunne...
1525274 1528069 disappeared from our home<br />on the morning of July 5th...
1529028 1531447 under suspicious circumstances.
1531614 1532949 Louder!
1533116 1537370 If anyone out there<br />has any information...
1537578 1539789 please come forward.
1539956 1541582 Thank you.
1543918 1546629 I'm Rand Elliott.<br />My wife, Marybeth Elliott.
1546796 1547880 Should I have said my name?
1548464 1550299 Amy is our only child.
1550466 1554470 She's bright, she's beautiful.<br />She's kind.
1554971 1556472 She really is Amazing Amy.
1556806 1559392 You know, there are<br />millions of people out there...
1559559 1561978 who grew up with her and care about her.
1562145 1564772 We care about her, we love her.
1565481 1568067 And we just want her back.
1569986 1572488 Amy is a decorated scholar.
1572655 1575491 She forged a successful career<br />in journalism.
1575658 1577827 She returned here<br />to her husband's hometown...
1577994 1580329 and she made a life in her adopted home.
1581414 1583666 Now, Amy needs your help.
1583833 1587837 We're establishing a volunteer<br />headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
1588004 1593342 We have a hotline, 1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.
1593593 1599015 And our website is<br />www.Find Amazing Amy.com.
1599515 1601476 - Mr. Dunne!<br />- Mr. Elliott!
1602852 1604687 Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?
1606439 1610109 Mr. Elliott, when was the last time<br />you spoke to your daughter?
1611611 1612612 Smile.
1619202 1620787 That's all for now. Thank you.
1623372 1626083 Amy is the kind of girl<br />who attracts admirers.
1626250 1627001 Right, Nick?
1627168 1628211 Yeah, definitely.
1628377 1630755 And we've had instances...
1630922 1632840 - where things got...<br />- Scary.
1633007 1634342 Do you know about Desi Collings?
1634509 1636052 Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings.
1636219 1637345 He was obsessed.
1637512 1640723 He attempted suicide after Amy<br />broke up with him sophomore year.
1640890 1642308 We had to file a restraining order.
1642475 1644727 This would be high school?<br />Twenty years ago?
1644894 1647980 But he recently moved to St. Louis.<br />That's just two hours away.
1648147 1649899 To be fair, he is from St. Louis.
1650066 1651567 We also have Tommy O'Hara.
1651734 1653820 This is only eight years ago,<br />in New York.
1653986 1656155 She broke up with him,<br />he got very physical.
1656322 1657865 - She filed charges.<br />- What was the charge?
1658032 1659992 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?
1660159 1661994 I only know it was bad.
1662161 1663830 - I didn't know this.<br />- Okay.
1663996 1665790 Thank you.
1665957 1667250 Anything more recent?
1670586 1672588 Not that I know of.
1675049 1677969 Hey, Nick? You got a minute?
1679136 1680763 Yeah.
1686143 1687395 Imagine our confusion.
1687562 1688604 A missing persons case...
1688771 1691232 and in your wife's dressing room,<br />we find an envelope marked "clue."
1691399 1693526 That's for our anniversary.
1693693 1695862 My wife does these treasure hunts.
1696028 1698281 I'm hoping you can tell me<br />what this means.
1698447 1699448 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?
1699866 1702076 It'll help me track Amy's movements<br />before she disappeared.
1702410 1704453 Of course. Okay.
1704620 1707206 "Although this spot<br />couldn't be tighter...
1707957 1710668 "it's a cozy room<br />for my favorite writer."
1713504 1714714 I know this one!
1715214 1718718 <i>Although this spot<br />couldn't be any tighter...</i>
1719343 1722138 <i>it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.</i>
1723639 1726934 <i>After-school meeting,<br />don't mind if I do.</i>
1727101 1730021 <i>Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.</i>
1734066 1736277 Well, well. What does it say?
1736444 1737945 Clue two.
1739071 1742450 "Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.
1742950 1746829 "You'll be the spy,<br />and I'll be his lover.
1747330 1748331 "Let's head on over...
1748414 1750166 "to the little brown house.
1750333 1754045 "We'll play hot, doting husband,<br />sweet, loving spouse."
1757089 1757840 These yours?
1758716 1759592 No.
1759759 1761093 But you read the first clue.
1761260 1764263 Randy professor, naughty student.
1764430 1765348 I blush.
1765514 1767266 Me and my ex just swapped cards.
1768476 1769727 Where's this little brown house?
1769894 1771395 I have no idea.
1814605 1815982 Hello?
1816649 1818526 Nicholas Dunne.
1819193 1822279 Under my father's name, William Dunne.
1828703 1832665 My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?<br />Can you just turn the bell...
1832832 1833666 Yeah, I know.
1833833 1835459 It's... It's...
1837920 1840214 It's "Puddles," right?<br />Or is it "Poodles?"
1844135 1845761 We're good.
1847346 1848347 Hello, stranger.
1848514 1850516 Fancy meeting you here.
1850683 1852852 It's your dad's house, right?
1853019 1854520 Are you following me?
1854687 1855438 What you doing?
1855604 1857648 Like you said, it's my dad's house.
1857815 1860526 I come by once a week,<br />make sure the place hasn't burned down.
1862319 1863612 But it looks okay.
1864363 1866240 I'll walk you out.
1869493 1870870 You know...
1871037 1874165 I thought maybe<br />this was the little brown house.
1874331 1875416 From the clue.
1875583 1877543 Nope. Still blue.
1894018 1898105 <i>Picture me,<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.</i>
1898272 1901984 <i>I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished," I mean "had."</i>
1902485 1905613 <i>It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.</i>
1905905 1909658 "So open the door, and look alive."
1910951 1911994 Bitch!
1915706 1918709 <i>Want to test your marriage<br />for weak spots?</i>
1919376 1920836 <i>Add one recession...</i>
1921170 1922463 <i>subtract two jobs.</i>
1923047 1925049 <i>It's surprisingly effective.</i>
1925216 1927510 Promise me we'll never be like them.
1927676 1928677 Like who?
1928844 1930471 All those awful couples we know.
1930638 1934475 Those wives who treat their men<br />like dancing monkeys...
1934642 1936102 to be trained and paraded.
1936727 1939438 Husbands who treat their wives<br />like the highway patrol...
1939814 1942399 to be out-foxed and avoided.
1947154 1948823 I think I'm gonna be laid off.
1949615 1952284 We're in a recession.<br />If it happens, we'll deal with it.
1952451 1954537 I'll probably be next.
1954703 1955955 We have each other.
1956330 1958874 Everything else is background noise.
1959959 1961752 You are exceptional.
1969468 1970719 My turn.
1972596 1975933 My parents' publisher dropped them,<br />and they're in debt up to their ears.
1976100 1976809 That's terrible.
1976976 1979270 And they need to borrow<br />from my trust fund.
1979436 1980813 How much?
1980980 1983190 Almost a million.
1983774 1985234 That's almost all of it.
1985401 1987570 This is where you say,<br />"Everything else is background noise."
1987736 1988654 Amy, if you're laid off...
1988946 1990072 and I'm laid off...
1990239 1991240 I said I'd do it.
1991407 1992533 Without talking to me?
1992700 1994160 - Well, it's...<br />- Your call.
1994326 1995911 ...their money, technically.
2000332 2002001 You know what? You're right.
2002626 2004628 Everything else<br />is just background noise.
2013596 2014597 Hey.
2018726 2019768 More games?
2019935 2021562 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.
2022771 2024231 What's the laptop for?
2025316 2026317 Laptop-ing.
2028569 2029361 I see.
2029528 2032531 You can give your parents $879,000<br />without talking to me...
2033073 2035576 but God forbid I buy a video game<br />without getting your permission.
2035743 2036660 You are spending a lot.
2036827 2038954 You don't trust me.<br />You don't trust my judgment.
2039121 2040539 You certainly don't trust my intention.
2040706 2041540 What are you talking about?
2041707 2043209 That's the basic tenet<br />of a prenup, isn't it?
2043375 2045502 Why are you throwing that<br />in my face again?
2045669 2047087 Because it's easy to throw.
2047254 2047922 Nick, I don't get it.
2048088 2051300 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2051467 2054428 The nagging shrew.<br />The controlling bitch.
2054595 2056847 I'm not that person. I'm your wife.
2057014 2058057 I'm sorry.
2058224 2060434 I just don't know how to do this.<br />I've never not had a job.
2060601 2062478 I flipped burgers, I painted houses.
2062645 2064647 You'll get another job.
2069068 2070277 Hi, Go.
2072029 2073656 What? Hold on. What?
2073822 2075115 <i>- And suddenly...</i><br />- Slow down, what is it?
2075282 2077159 <i>...I knew everything<br />was about to get worse.</i>
2077326 2078911 Okay, tell me what's wrong.
2106272 2107773 - Bless you, Nick.<br />- Father.
2108440 2109733 Hey, Tom. Mayor!
2109900 2111026 Nick, good to see you.
2111193 2112069 Good to see you.
2112236 2113487 Hey, guys, hey.
2115906 2117408 - Jodie.<br />- Nick.
2119118 2120744 Oh, we'll find her.
2135718 2137303 You look like hammered shit.
2137469 2139138 Thank you.
2147229 2148689 You ever see that guy<br />in the glasses before?
2149606 2152234 Don't worry. We videotape everybody<br />that comes in and out of these things.
2152401 2154069 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...
2154236 2155154 Do-gooders?
2155321 2156405 Freaks.
2156572 2158407 Hey, I meant to ask you.
2158574 2160034 Noelle Hawthorne?
2160909 2162619 She lives on your street.<br />Amy's best friend.
2163746 2164955 I've never heard the name<br />Noelle Hawthorne.
2165122 2167166 She and her husband have triplets.
2167333 2168208 Oh.
2168625 2171462 Yeah, we might say hi to them<br />on the street.
2171837 2174006 But "best friend"? No.
2174548 2175758 Excuse me, one sec.
2180054 2182014 He acted like<br />Noelle was a complete stranger.
2182181 2183265 Of course he did.
2183640 2184808 Look, these two are yours.
2184975 2187227 Oh, look. He's being a good guy...
2187394 2189188 so everybody can see him<br />being a good guy.
2189355 2191023 You really don't like him, do you?
2191190 2192691 What's to like?
2214380 2217883 <i>This mailbox is currently full.<br />Press one to...</i>
2218050 2221428 Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.<br />My name's Shawna Kelly.
2221678 2224264 I am so sorry for your troubles.
2224431 2225224 Thank you. That's kind.
2225391 2226683 Are you remembering to eat?
2226850 2227851 Well, a lot of cold cuts.
2228018 2232064 I'm gonna fix you up<br />my world-famous chicken Frito pie.
2232231 2233607 That's very kind and very unnecessary.
2233774 2235401 You have to keep your strength.
2235943 2236902 Would you...
2237820 2239696 say, "Chicken Frito pie!"
2243909 2245202 You know what?
2246453 2247704 Would you delete that picture for me?
2247871 2249623 - It's a nice photo.<br />- I know it is.
2249790 2251083 But just do me a favor.
2251250 2252876 Will you?
2253043 2255838 Would you go ahead<br />and please delete that picture?
2256004 2256672 You just press...
2257047 2258424 What is wrong with you?
2258590 2259758 Could you please not<br />share that with anyone?
2259925 2263262 I will share it with whomever I please.
2267057 2268308 - Dude.<br />- Yeah?
2268475 2269810 Marybeth is pissed.
2270519 2271311 Why?
2274189 2275649 Marybeth?
2275816 2279236 It's like you're the goddamn<br />Homecoming King.
2281655 2283991 It was important to my mother<br />that I be polite...
2284158 2285951 I be considerate, I be a gentleman.
2286118 2287703 It looked like you were having fun.
2287870 2290122 I am in a nightmare!
2290831 2293125 All I'm trying to do is be nice...
2293292 2297004 to the people who are<br />volunteering to help find Amy.
2298964 2300716 You're right.
2301592 2303552 And I'm sorry.
2305554 2309183 My God, this place literally<br />smells like feces.
2320152 2323363 In your searches,<br />did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?
2323530 2324948 No.
2326074 2327659 How about a brand new Stratocaster?
2327826 2328952 No, nothing like that.
2329661 2331747 Well, all right.
2336752 2339671 How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.
2339838 2341006 No, it's nowhere near that.
2341173 2342257 Okay.
2342716 2344009 - Kibble?<br />- Excuse me?
2344176 2346136 He asked me to feed his cat.
2346303 2347513 I saw some in the pantry.
2347846 2352476 Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?<br />Noelle Hawthorne!
2352643 2354102 I know y'all are in there!
2354269 2358774 Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne<br />and her children back out to the street?
2359650 2361610 Detective Boney!
2361777 2365614 Just remind her<br />it is a possible crime scene.
2374331 2379169 <i>Look at that pie-eating grin,<br />from a guy whose wife is missing.</i>
2384967 2386552 - How are you doing?<br />- Terrific.
2388303 2389680 How's Marybeth?
2389846 2391557 She's a wreck.
2391723 2393183 And you?
2393809 2395310 Awesome.
2395477 2396311 Hey...
2396478 2398063 have you told me everything?
2398313 2399147 Of course.
2399314 2400148 Everything?
2400315 2401358 Why would you even ask me that?
2401525 2405696 Ever since you walked into The Bar that<br />morning Amy went missing, you seem...
2406989 2407990 - off.<br />- I am off.
2409032 2412244 Everybody's examining me<br />and projecting their shit on me.
2412411 2415706 All I want is to come over here,<br />have a beer with you...
2415872 2417082 and not be judged.
2417249 2418750 Can we do that?
2419835 2421169 Of course.
2422546 2424423 You know what I keep thinking?
2424590 2425507 If Mom were here?
2425674 2429094 Yeah. Like I'm 12.
2430554 2433348 Nick, Mom would fix it.
2440564 2443775 I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.
2446695 2449031 - Love you.<br />- Love you.
2453368 2455287 <i>So, here's a strange, new sentence.</i>
2455454 2458915 <i>I am a Missourian.</i>
2465714 2467090 Bye, Dad.
2469009 2472346 <i>No money, no jobs, no prospects.</i>
2472512 2474556 <i>And then, we heard from Go.</i>
2474723 2476516 <i>Mama Maureen...</i>
2476683 2479519 <i>Stage 4 breast cancer.</i>
2481688 2484399 <i>So, we moved to Missouri.</i>
2484566 2486068 <i>I don't mind.</i>
2486234 2489404 <i>I just wish he'd asked.</i>
2501083 2503502 <i>Nick is happy to be home.</i>
2503585 2506088 <i>But I don't know<br />if he's happy I'm with him.</i>
2507589 2510717 <i>I feel like something<br />he loaded by mistake.</i>
2510884 2513929 <i>Something to be jettisoned,<br />if necessary.</i>
2514096 2516306 <i>Something disposable.</i>
2518141 2520769 <i>I feel like I could disappear.</i>
2564771 2566648 Oh, my God!
2566815 2568650 - I saw you on TV.<br />- Okay.
2568817 2570360 - It's so crazy.<br />- Yeah, I know.
2570527 2572612 - She just vanished?<br />- She's just gone.
2572779 2574489 - I've been so worried about you.<br />- Where have you been?
2574656 2576366 I called you a hundred times.<br />You gotta pick up your phone!
2576533 2577451 Rehearsals.
2577617 2578535 What?
2578702 2579995 <i>Godspell.</i>
2581830 2583290 My sister's asleep in the other room.
2583457 2584458 I needed to see you.
2584624 2586168 I know this is a bad idea.
2586334 2587711 Can you at least tell me you love me?
2587878 2591506 I do love you, but we have<br />to be really careful right now.
2591673 2592799 I've been so scared.
2592966 2594050 Between rehearsals?
2594217 2595844 You told me<br />I needed to have my own life.
2596011 2597387 I know.
2597554 2598680 We need to stop.
2598847 2600015 I need you.
2601141 2602976 Touch me.
2606396 2609024 Stop it. Come here.
2610400 2611985 Sit down.
2612152 2613361 Okay.
2613528 2617491 Did you, by any chance,<br />tell anybody anything about us?
2617657 2619034 Even in texting, or on Facebook.
2619201 2621870 Facebook? I use the disposable phone.
2622037 2623830 You buy my presents in cash.<br />I'm not stupid, Nick.
2623997 2626750 I know, sweetie.<br />Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office?
2626917 2630212 I don't know. Maybe.<br />They better be mine.
2630378 2631213 Sweetheart, think.
2631379 2633715 I don't know. I'd have to check<br />my red panty inventory.
2633882 2636384 Andie, I need you<br />to take this seriously, okay?
2636551 2638220 This is the last time<br />we're gonna see each other, until...
2638386 2639846 Until when?
2640388 2641723 Until it's safe.
2641890 2643350 You were going to get a divorce.
2643517 2645560 Never say that out loud again.
2645727 2648396 Okay. I'm sorry.
2649272 2650232 I don't wanna fight.
2652275 2653735 I just wanna be with you.
2653902 2655070 Andie, please...
2655904 2657572 That's all I want.
2658907 2659991 I can't.
2662327 2664454 It's our last time together.
2664621 2666665 Let's make the most of it.
2673421 2676758 Real quick, but then you have to go.
2679594 2682264 <i>My husband has come undone.</i>
2682430 2685267 <i>We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...</i>
2685433 2688144 <i>but as it turns out, we couldn't.</i>
2691439 2693191 It means a lot that you came.
2694359 2695610 <i>We took a hit on the brownstone...</i>
2695777 2698113 <i>and I used the last of my trust fund<br />to buy him a bar.</i>
2698864 2701116 <i>So far, it's just costing money.</i>
2705328 2709124 <i>Nick uses me for sex when he wants.</i>
2712294 2714796 <i>Otherwise, I don't exist.</i>
2716047 2718008 We should go to Outback tonight.
2718174 2719301 That would be nice.
2719467 2722554 <i>Last night, I went from desperate<br />to pathetic.</i>
2723471 2726516 <i>I became someone I don't even like.</i>
2726683 2728476 <i>The kind of woman I used to mock.</i>
2728894 2730478 You're out so much.
2730645 2732856 - I know.<br />- Stay home.
2733023 2735233 - I can't, I'm already late.<br />- Then, can I come?
2735400 2737068 You would hate it.
2737235 2740488 It's a bunch<br />of my dorky high school friends.
2741489 2744367 Do our code. No bullshit.
2744826 2747203 I thought<br />we weren't gonna be that couple.
2753710 2755545 Okay, bye.
2757213 2760050 - Hey, I've been thinking.<br />- Yeah?
2760216 2761593 Something positive.
2763011 2764054 Maybe it's time.
2765347 2767057 Now is literally the worst time.
2767223 2768266 It would be a new start for us.
2768683 2771269 And for me,<br />I would have a real purpose here.
2771436 2772520 A child is not a hobby.
2772687 2773688 Not a hobby.
2774689 2775899 An inspiration.
2776441 2779444 We could have had this fight<br />four hours ago. I'm late.
2779611 2780737 I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.
2780904 2784199 You really wanna be the couple<br />that has a baby to save their marriage?
2784366 2785367 "Save"?
2785867 2787911 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!
2788078 2790121 - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br />- Yeah!
2790288 2792707 You're a fucking coward.
2792874 2794626 No, it can't go on like this.
2794793 2795710 Really?
2795877 2797253 - I won't.<br />- You won't?
2797420 2799631 You won't?<br />Why, it's not good enough for you?
2799798 2800590 It's not even close!
2800757 2802884 You stupid bitch!
2803468 2806304 <i>What scared me<br />wasn't that he'd pushed me.</i>
2806471 2810308 <i>What scared me was how much<br />he wanted to hurt me more.</i>
2810642 2812727 <i>What scared me<br />was that I'd finally realized...</i>
2813728 2817399 <i>I am frightened of my own husband.</i>
2829285 2830662 You want me to call for backup?
2830829 2832914 Nah, I'll protect you.
2840672 2842090 Jesus.
2847137 2849806 They ought to burn this place down.
2850265 2851933 Seems like folks are trying.
2857439 2859607 You really think this is anything?
2859774 2861943 Cross it off the list.
2873038 2874622 Hey, Jason.
2874789 2876207 What's up, Rhonda?
2876374 2878626 "...and dedicated to the proposition<br />that all men..."
2879711 2882213 - Have you seen this girl around here?<br />- Why do you ask?
2882464 2884299 She was reported missing.
2887469 2889220 "...and so dedicated, can long endure."
2889387 2891181 Yeah. I remember her.
2891347 2893475 What did she want?<br />Weed, pills?
2895143 2896144 She wanted a gun.
2896394 2898313 I told her it's not my thing.
2898480 2901357 I felt bad, though.<br />She seemed really desperate.
2901524 2904986 She said it needed to be small,<br />so she could keep it close.
2905153 2906863 Are you sure this is her?
2907030 2909157 You don't forget a girl like that<br />in here.
2910158 2911534 She was all in pink.
2911701 2914245 It was Valentine's Day.
2917207 2919834 <i>For Valentine's Day,<br />I thought I'd buy a gun.</i>
2920001 2922587 <i>That is how crazy I've become.</i>
2923671 2927675 <i>Nick wants me gone<br />but he won't ask for a divorce.</i>
2927842 2931846 <i>In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,<br />his only line of credit.</i>
2932013 2933515 <i>The bitch with the prenup.</i>
2935350 2937560 <i>I could go home to my parents...</i>
2937727 2940021 <i>but I'd have to tell them the truth.</i>
2940188 2943900 <i>And I don't even know<br />if I believe the truth.</i>
2944067 2946861 <i>Can I really think Nick would hurt me?</i>
2947487 2949864 <i>I'm being paranoid. Crazy.</i>
2951199 2951866 <i>It's just...</i>
2953159 2955703 <i>I'd sleep better with a gun.</i>
2966589 2967882 Oh, shit.
2968049 2971678 Wake up, baby.<br />My sister's gonna come out here.
2976057 2978268 - Sorry to rush you.<br />- It's okay.
2980228 2981563 - Here. Let me help you.<br />- Okay.
2981771 2983857 Just get that.
2986526 2988027 Be very careful.
2988862 2989737 I'm all right.
2989904 2992365 Here you go.
2992532 2994284 Promise me we'll talk every day.
2994450 2995577 Okay, we will.
2995743 2998454 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.
2999247 3000206 Don't go crazy.
3000373 3001624 Okay.
3006045 3009257 You fucking idiot.
3009424 3013261 You fucking asshole!<br />You fucking lied to my fucking face!
3014762 3016306 I'm sorry.
3018099 3019058 How old is she?
3019434 3020643 She's in her early 20s.
3021561 3022395 How long?
3023104 3025773 - A year and a half.<br />- You lied to me for over a year?
3025940 3027483 If I told you,<br />you would have made me stop.
3027650 3029110 It's so fucking small.
3029277 3032113 You're a liar and a cheat!<br />You're just like Dad!
3032280 3033448 How did you even meet her?
3033615 3034824 She's one of my students.
3036075 3037619 I thought writers hated clichés.
3037785 3038494 I'm not a writer.
3038661 3040788 "Boo-hoo, I got laid off.<br />I guess I'll fuck a teenager."
3040955 3043625 It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br />no idea how shitty it was with Amy...
3043791 3045585 how fucking terrible she made me feel.
3045752 3048796 Flyover Boy.<br />I would get knots in my stomach...
3048963 3050673 just coming home,<br />knowing she would be sitting there...
3050840 3052842 dissatisfied, before I even<br />walked in the fucking door.
3053009 3054302 This is so bad.
3054469 3056429 If anybody finds out,<br />you're totally fucked.
3056596 3059098 Boney found a pair of panties<br />in my office...
3059265 3060808 where, occasionally, Andie and I...
3061267 3062268 I don't know what the fuck it means.
3062435 3063478 Are they Super-Twat's?
3063645 3065605 Her name is Andie.
3065772 3067148 She's not entirely sure.
3067315 3068858 So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...
3069025 3070318 who isn't sure<br />where she leaves her undies?
3070485 3072612 If they're not Andie's,<br />that means that they're Amy's...
3072779 3074364 and she left them there for me to find.
3074530 3078159 Nick, I was scared for you before,<br />and now, I'm fucking petrified.
3078326 3080495 We're having a vigil tonight<br />for your missing wife...
3080662 3083665 and this morning, you're kissing<br />your college girlfriend goodbye!
3083831 3084999 Can you imagine?
3085625 3088836 Have you watched television lately?
3089003 3092006 Cable news is all over your shit.
3092632 3094342 <i>I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?</i>
3094509 3096678 <i>His wife's nowhere to be found...</i>
3096844 3100390 <i>and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.<br />Cute pic, huh?</i>
3100556 3102892 - Who is that?<br />- Some fucking tragedy groupie.
3103059 3104852 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- I don't know.
3105019 3106020 She was trying to give me a casserole.
3106187 3109190 <i>On the show today<br />we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt...</i>
3109357 3111901 <i>patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.</i>
3112193 3115571 <i>Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider<br />defending Nick Dunne?</i>
3115738 3116739 <i>Well, let me just say...</i>
3116906 3119534 <i>as always, Ellen,<br />thank you for such a warm welcome.</i>
3119701 3121244 <i>But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.</i>
3121536 3123913 <i>Listen, just because this guy<br />isn't walking around weeping...</i>
3124080 3125373 <i>that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.</i>
3125540 3128751 <i>Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath<br />is a lack of empathy.</i>
3128918 3130878 <i>But the truth is,<br />you'd have to be a sociopath...</i>
3131379 3133047 <i>to behave normally in this situation...</i>
3133214 3135842 <i>because it's the most<br />abnormal situation in the world.</i>
3136009 3138553 <i>Tanner, are you trying to tell me<br />that this photo...</i>
3138720 3140847 <i>is remotely in the realm<br />of acceptable behavior?</i>
3141014 3143683 I'm so sick<br />of being picked apart by women.
3145059 3146936 You need to hire Tanner Bolt.
3149022 3149689 I don't deserve this.
3149856 3151607 <i>Innocent until proven guilty.</i>
3151774 3154027 That's exactly what you deserve.
3154193 3155737 Go home, Nick.
3181721 3183139 Hey, buddy.
3199030 3200698 I can't believe<br />we haven't arrested this guy.
3200865 3202700 We're not gonna arrest anybody...
3202867 3204369 just because some blonde dunce says so.
3204786 3207288 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3207580 3210792 One, I am conducting an investigation,<br />not a witch-hunt.
3210958 3212752 And, two,<br />don't talk to me that way, ever.
3212919 3214087 She was trying to buy a gun.
3214253 3216297 We don't know who<br />or what was scaring her, Gil.
3216464 3217382 Give me the update.
3217965 3220468 No drug angles panned out yet,<br />so cross that off the list.
3220635 3222470 I talked to the nurses<br />who care for Nick's father.
3222637 3225223 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten,<br />so cross that off the list.
3225390 3226432 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3226599 3229894 So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br />like the 4th of July.
3230061 3231229 - Whoa.<br />- Yeah.
3231396 3232397 The blood is profuse.
3232563 3234649 It is Amy's, type B,<br />and we should have DNA soon.
3234816 3235775 Thoughts on a weapon?
3235942 3237735 Trajectory indicates blunt force.
3237902 3240238 Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
3240822 3243950 She fell there,<br />but I doubt she got back up.
3244117 3245410 Amy's medical records come in?
3245576 3247578 No, we'll have them later tonight.
3249163 3250581 My wife says he's a killer.
3250832 3253167 Well, if Tiffany says...
3278776 3279777 Hey.
3280111 3281112 Hey.
3285533 3286534 Thank you all for coming out.
3288369 3289871 Hey Donnie, how are you?
3290037 3293374 Rich, thank you so much.
3300673 3301674 Hey.
3308723 3312185 <i>Thank you, folks.<br />Thank you for being here tonight.</i>
3312351 3314145 <i>It just means the world to our family.</i>
3314687 3316147 And to Amy.
3316731 3318733 As you all know...
3319567 3322737 my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...
3322904 3324405 disappeared three days ago.
3324989 3328409 And I want to implore anyone<br />who has any information at all...
3328576 3331370 please come forward. Help us.
3331537 3332330 So hot.
3332497 3333748 He is so creepy.
3333915 3337251 I wanna say something, because I think<br />some of you might be wondering...
3337418 3339337 and are too polite to ask.
3339837 3342924 I had nothing to do<br />with the disappearance of my wife.
3343508 3345343 I'm cooperating with the police.
3345510 3347428 I haven't hired a lawyer.
3347595 3348721 I have nothing to hide.
3350014 3352517 Amy is my soul mate.
3352767 3354060 She is brilliant...
3354602 3357688 she's charming, and wise.
3358022 3359732 I love you, Amy.
3363861 3364946 Asshole.
3366280 3368199 I love my wife...
3368574 3369784 so much.
3372286 3376624 And I may not behave for the cameras<br />the way they want me to...
3377041 3380127 and if they wanna punish me for that,<br />that's okay.
3380294 3383881 But I just wanna ask you in the media,<br />please, harass me...
3384048 3386968 but don't harass<br />the people of this town.
3387134 3389053 If you need to mock somebody, mock me.
3389220 3390304 Nick!
3390471 3392139 But please don't turn this investigation<br />into a circus.
3392640 3394100 Where's your wife, Nick?
3394267 3395768 Let the police do their jobs.
3396227 3397812 What did you do to your pregnant wife?
3399647 3400773 Did you tell them that, Nick?
3400940 3402984 Did you tell them<br />Amy was six weeks pregnant?
3406737 3408906 Thank you for your support tonight.<br />Let's find Amy.
3411075 3412493 Go ahead,<br />if you guys wanna say something.
3416789 3418165 Gil, go, go.
3420501 3421502 Nick, where are you going?
3421669 3423129 Stop him!
3423296 3425506 No questions right now. Thank you.
3428009 3429552 Why are you running away?
3430636 3432054 Don't run.
3433139 3434140 Everybody, stay back.
3438936 3440980 Guys, come on. You know better.
3441147 3443482 Get off the grass, get down to the curb.
3443649 3444942 - Hey, Gil...<br />- On it.
3445109 3446027 All right.
3446193 3447945 All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.
3448029 3449322 Hello?
3450072 3451490 Hello?
3451657 3452366 Fuck.
3452533 3453909 You scared me. Want a drink?
3454076 3455453 Did you know she was pregnant?
3455620 3457622 I told you,<br />Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.
3457788 3458831 She doesn't even know Amy.
3459498 3460916 They look like pretty good friends<br />to me.
3468674 3471969 Look, I don't know.<br />But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
3472136 3473220 We have her medical records coming.
3473387 3475139 - Good.<br />- So, let's talk while we wait.
3475306 3477391 Let's start over here.<br />The scene of the crime.
3477558 3480311 You see, we've seen dozens<br />of home invasions.
3480478 3482313 Dozens and dozens.
3482480 3484565 This area right here, it looked wrong<br />from the second we saw it.
3484732 3487902 The whole thing looked staged.<br />Watch this.
3489820 3493240 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3493658 3495284 I don't know.<br />What do you want me to say?
3495451 3496952 Did you do any housekeeping<br />the day your wife went missing?
3497119 3497953 No.
3498120 3500247 Because our guys did a luminol test.
3500414 3502958 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3503125 3505252 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.<br />A lot.
3505419 3506253 Oh, my God.
3506420 3507630 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.
3507797 3510132 Wait a second.<br />Why would they mop up the blood...
3510299 3511759 if they're trying to stage<br />a crime scene?
3511926 3514553 No blood and no body<br />suggests kidnapping.
3514720 3517014 It tells us,<br />look at people outside the house.
3517181 3518474 Like these homeless you keep mentioning.
3518641 3521602 A pool of blood and no body<br />suggests homicide.
3521769 3523646 It tells us to look at people<br />inside the house.
3523813 3526399 - Which is what we're doing here, Nick.<br />- I see.
3526565 3529402 So, how was your marriage, Nick?<br />Because right now, all we got is Noelle.
3529568 3530986 She says, "Not good."
3531153 3532530 Gil, what do you and your wife<br />argue about?
3532697 3534699 - What pisses you off?<br />- Money, lack thereof.
3534865 3536492 Me and my ex, it's the same.
3536659 3539870 I mention that because<br />we got a look at your finances, Nick.
3540037 3542623 $117,000 in credit card debt.
3542790 3544625 - What?<br />- I pulled up some of the merchandise.
3544792 3546669 There are these fun little splurges.
3546836 3548254 I didn't buy any of this stuff.
3548421 3549422 I don't even golf!
3549588 3550798 I do! You bought great clubs.
3550965 3552133 I like the robot dog.
3552299 3554135 This is identity theft!<br />This is a felony!
3554301 3555136 We need to find out who did this!
3555302 3556929 All right.<br />Let's talk about life insurance.
3557096 3559515 Because in April,<br />you bumped up Amy's life insurance...
3559682 3560558 to $1.2 million.
3560725 3562977 Yes, I did. That was her idea.<br />She wanted me to.
3563144 3564186 You filed the paperwork.
3564353 3565563 Because she told me to!
3566397 3567189 Hold on a sec.
3567356 3569150 Yeah? Okay.
3571068 3572236 For sure?
3572653 3573821 All right.
3577908 3578868 She was pregnant.
3582997 3584498 This is insane.
3584665 3587042 So, my question becomes...
3587209 3590004 I don't want to talk<br />to you again, ever...
3590171 3591338 without a lawyer.
3599680 3600681 Margo!
3611567 3612568 Hey.
3614945 3617239 Just hold on a second. Let me finish.
3617406 3618199 Nick?
3618365 3621035 I hear you, I hear you.<br />I was as surprised as...
3621202 3625039 I know you're upset.<br />I had no idea she was pregnant.
3625456 3628584 Listen, I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't...
3631086 3633088 You want to know the truth?
3633255 3635633 The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.
3638052 3640095 Well, I'm as surprised as...
3641430 3643224 You told me you didn't want kids.
3644225 3645476 I was trying to put a good face on.
3645643 3647394 Then, suddenly,<br />you've got a pregnant wife.
3647561 3648771 That's a problem for you.
3648938 3651899 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3652066 3653400 Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!
3653567 3654902 You have to fucking talk to me!
3657571 3661492 I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids<br />because she didn't want me to.
3661659 3663744 Because it would have just been<br />another reason for you to hate her.
3663911 3665663 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just...
3665830 3667915 - Lie to me?<br />- I wanted kids!
3668082 3670125 When we first moved here,<br />I went to a fertility clinic!
3670292 3671836 - It didn't work?<br />- I did my part!
3672002 3672920 Masturbate.
3673087 3674672 When it came time for Amy to do her thing,<br />all of a sudden it was like...
3674839 3676257 "Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."
3676423 3678425 Now, who would believe you?
3679593 3680803 All right.
3690437 3692106 This is a letter from the clinic...
3692273 3694608 notifying me<br />that they're gonna destroy my sample...
3694775 3696777 unless I contact them.
3698028 3699446 So, I gave it to Amy.
3699613 3702491 The next day, I saw it in the trash.
3702658 3704118 But you were already with Andie<br />by then, right?
3704285 3706996 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3707162 3711333 A year ago, Amy being pregnant<br />would have been the best thing ever!
3717882 3719633 "When your poor Amy has a cold,<br />this dessert just..."
3719800 3721051 This is the clue you couldn't solve.
3721218 3722344 Yeah.
3724054 3727308 A letter from Desi.<br />That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
3727474 3729727 It was the fucking rich guy<br />who would do anything for her.
3729894 3731729 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3731896 3732855 Your prenup?
3733230 3736066 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3736233 3738027 I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!
3740905 3743908 I love you no matter what.
3744074 3745326 But you need to tell me.
3745492 3746911 Tell you what?
3747745 3749371 What are you asking me?
3750956 3754126 Are you asking me<br />if I killed my wife, Go?
3754585 3756545 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3756712 3759131 I would never ask you that!
3763093 3764094 Margo!
3776899 3779109 Don't walk on the glass.
3780819 3783447 You have no clue, do you?
3801256 3802841 Why was he here that night?
3804468 3807179 His wife is missing. Why come here?
3807346 3808263 Who cares?
3808555 3809682 Rhonda, we got this.
3809848 3811225 Let's make the arrest.
3811392 3813352 Do you know how hard it is<br />to make a murder case without a body?
3813519 3814353 No.
3814478 3816522 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3816689 3819441 So, I want one last thing.
3819608 3820442 What's that?
3822236 3824530 I want a body.
3825698 3829994 <i>Picture me.<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.</i>
3830160 3831787 Be careful.
3836333 3840754 <i>I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished," I mean "had."</i>
3845300 3846301 Fuck.
3848262 3851098 <i>It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.</i>
3852349 3854393 <i>So, open the door...</i>
3854560 3855811 Punish. Wood. Beach.
3855978 3858480 <i>...and look alive.</i>
3861608 3864194 Punish. Wood.
3865362 3866947 Wood.
3899063 3901648 <i>I will practice believing<br />my husband loves me...</i>
3901815 3904234 <i>and will love this baby.</i>
3904902 3908530 <i>That this child<br />might really save our marriage.</i>
3909406 3910866 <i>But I could be wrong.</i>
3917039 3918957 <i>Because sometimes...</i>
3919958 3922169 <i>the way he looks at me...</i>
3923253 3924880 <i>I think...</i>
3925047 3926131 <i>man of my dreams...</i>
3928050 3930135 <i>father of my child...</i>
3930928 3934932 <i>this man of mine may kill me.</i>
3936308 3938310 <i>He may truly...</i>
3939228 3939978 <i>kill me.</i>
3942940 3943816 WTF?
3968882 3971468 <i>I am so much happier now that I'm dead.</i>
3976515 3978100 <i>Technically, "missing."</i>
3978934 3980602 <i>Soon to be presumed dead.</i>
3982312 3983438 <i>Gone.</i>
3984398 3987526 <i>And my lazy, lying, cheating,<br />oblivious husband...</i>
3987693 3990988 <i>will go to prison for my murder.</i>
3992281 3994700 <i>Nick Dunne took my pride<br />and my dignity...</i>
3994867 3997244 <i>and my hope and my money.</i>
3997411 4000873 <i>He took and took from me<br />until I no longer existed.</i>
4001039 4002332 <i>That's murder.</i>
4002499 4005294 <i>Let the punishment fit the crime.</i>
4005878 4008881 <i>To fake a convincing murder,<br />you have to have discipline.</i>
4013093 4016096 <i>You befriend a local idiot.</i>
4019641 4022811 <i>Harvest the details<br />of her humdrum life.</i>
4023187 4026773 <i>And cram her with stories<br />about your husband's violent temper.</i>
4027900 4030194 <i>Secretly create some money troubles.</i>
4030444 4033614 <i>Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.</i>
4036241 4038327 <i>With the help of the unwitting...</i>
4038493 4040495 <i>bump up your life insurance.</i>
4042206 4045250 <i>Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.</i>
4045417 4048712 <i>Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.</i>
4049171 4053675 <i>You need to package yourself so that<br />people will truly mourn your loss.</i>
4053842 4056803 <i>And America loves pregnant women.</i>
4057137 4060015 <i>As if it's so hard to spread your legs.</i>
4060182 4061475 <i>You know what's hard?</i>
4061975 4063810 <i>Faking a pregnancy.</i>
4063977 4066146 <i>First, drain your toilet.</i>
4067856 4070484 <i>Invite pregnant idiot into your home...</i>
4070651 4073153 <i>and ply her with lemonade.</i>
4078325 4080494 <i>Steal pregnant idiot's urine.</i>
4082704 4084081 <i>Voilà.</i>
4084248 4088210 <i>A pregnancy is now part<br />of your legal medical record.</i>
4094716 4096051 <i>Happy anniversary.</i>
4098720 4101348 <i>Wait for your clueless husband...</i>
4101515 4103392 <i>to start his day.</i>
4104851 4106186 <i>Off he goes.</i>
4106353 4108522 <i>And the clock is ticking.</i>
4109690 4112192 <i>Meticulously stage your crime scene...</i>
4112859 4116863 <i>with just enough mistakes<br />to raise the specter of doubt.</i>
4118282 4120242 <i>You need to bleed.</i>
4120575 4121285 <i>A lot.</i>
4122202 4123870 <i>A lot, a lot.</i>
4127207 4129042 <i>A head wound kind of bleed.</i>
4129710 4132212 <i>A crime scene kind of bleed.</i>
4135215 4137217 <i>You need to clean poorly...</i>
4137384 4138218 <i>like he would.</i>
4139094 4141596 <i>Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.</i>
4142222 4144808 <i>And leave a little something behind.</i>
4145475 4147227 <i>A fire in July?</i>
4148770 4149730 <i>And because you're you...</i>
4149896 4151148 <i>you don't stop there.</i>
4151565 4153650 <i>You need a diary.</i>
4153817 4156737 <i>Minimum, 300 entries<br />on the Nick and Amy story.</i>
4157404 4159573 <i>Start with the fairy tale early days.</i>
4159740 4161908 <i>Those are true. And they're crucial.</i>
4162075 4164077 <i>You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.</i>
4164411 4166913 <i>After that, you invent.</i>
4167080 4167914 <i>The spending.</i>
4168081 4169750 <i>The abuse. The fear.</i>
4169916 4172753 <i>The threat of violence.</i>
4172919 4174880 <i>And Nick thought he was the writer.</i>
4175589 4176882 <i>Burn it just the right amount.</i>
4178717 4180594 <i>Make sure the cops will find it.</i>
4185599 4188643 <i>Finally, honor tradition<br />with a very special treasure hunt.</i>
4191229 4193982 <i>And if I get everything right,<br />the world will hate Nick...</i>
4194066 4196651 <i>for killing his beautiful,<br />pregnant wife.</i>
4196818 4199321 <i>And after all the outrage,<br />when I'm ready...</i>
4199488 4201323 <i>I'll go out on the water<br />with a handful of pills...</i>
4201490 4203909 <i>and a pocket full of stones.</i>
4204076 4206745 <i>And when they find my body,<br />they'll know...</i>
4206912 4210082 <i>Nick Dunne dumped his beloved<br />like garbage.</i>
4210248 4212459 <i>And she floated down<br />past all the other...</i>
4212626 4215962 <i>abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.</i>
4217339 4219299 <i>Then, Nick will die, too.</i>
4220175 4221927 <i>Nick and Amy will be gone.</i>
4222094 4224096 <i>But, then, we never really existed.</i>
4224262 4227349 <i>Nick loved a girl<br />I was pretending to be.</i>
4227516 4228266 <i>"Cool Girl."</i>
4228975 4232687 <i>Men always use that<br />as their defining compliment.</i>
4232854 4233814 <i>"She's a cool girl."</i>
4234981 4235982 <i>Cool Girl is hot.</i>
4236149 4237442 <i>Cool Girl is game.</i>
4237609 4238527 <i>Cool Girl is fun.</i>
4238944 4241321 <i>Cool Girl never gets angry at her man.</i>
4241488 4244116 <i>She only smiles in a chagrined,<br />loving manner...</i>
4244783 4247619 <i>and then presents her mouth for fucking.</i>
4247786 4249663 <i>She likes what he likes.</i>
4249830 4253291 <i>So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster<br />who loves fetish manga.</i>
4254334 4257504 <i>If he likes Girls Gone Wild,<br />she's a mall babe...</i>
4257671 4261341 <i>who talks football<br />and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.</i>
4261508 4264970 <i>When I met Nick Dunne,<br />I knew he wanted Cool Girl.</i>
4265137 4267681 <i>And for him, I'll admit,<br />I was willing to try.</i>
4267848 4269850 <i>I wax-stripped my pussy raw.</i>
4270517 4273645 <i>I drank canned beer<br />watching Adam Sandler movies.</i>
4273895 4276523 <i>I ate cold pizza<br />and remained a size two.</i>
4276731 4278692 <i>I blew him semi-regularly.</i>
4280026 4281361 <i>I lived in the moment.</i>
4281653 4284197 <i>I was fucking game.</i>
4284823 4286867 <i>I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.</i>
4287701 4290871 <i>Nick teased out of me<br />things I didn't know existed.</i>
4291037 4294207 <i>A lightness, a humor, an ease.</i>
4294374 4297169 <i>But I made him smarter. Sharper.</i>
4297335 4300839 <i>I inspired him to rise to my level.</i>
4301006 4304759 <i>I forged the man of my dreams.</i>
4307095 4309890 <i>We were happy pretending<br />to be other people.</i>
4310056 4311892 <i>We were the happiest couple we knew.</i>
4313518 4316521 <i>And what's the point of being together<br />if you're not the happiest?</i>
4317189 4319274 <i>But Nick got lazy.</i>
4319441 4321526 <i>He became someone<br />I did not agree to marry.</i>
4321693 4324863 <i>He actually expected me<br />to love him unconditionally.</i>
4325530 4329910 <i>Then he dragged me, penniless,<br />to the navel of this great country...</i>
4330076 4333914 <i>and found himself a newer,<br />younger, bouncier...</i>
4334080 4335081 <i>Cool Girl.</i>
4337417 4341588 <i>You think I'd let him destroy me<br />and end up happier than ever?</i>
4342088 4343757 <i>No fucking way.</i>
4344132 4345926 <i>He doesn't get to win.</i>
4356269 4360232 <i>My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,<br />Missouri guy.</i>
4362651 4365111 <i>He needed to learn.</i>
4365820 4368448 <i>Grown-ups work for things.</i>
4368990 4370951 <i>Grown-ups pay.</i>
4372327 4374913 <i>Grown-ups suffer consequences.</i>
4378416 4379626 Wait.
4380001 4382671 I need 20 seconds where you<br />don't judge me, interrupt me...
4382837 4384464 or get angry.
4385924 4387467 Okay.
4391429 4393265 Is that all the stuff<br />from the credit cards?
4393431 4396476 Where do you store goodies<br />for anniversary five?
4396643 4397310 Wood.
4397477 4400480 - Woodshed.<br />- Yeah, my woodshed.
4400647 4403149 That fucking bitch.
4404985 4406194 - I thought...<br />- It's all right.
4406361 4407821 I would have, too.
4411283 4412367 What's that present?
4412534 4414160 I don't know.
4414327 4416288 Let's find out.
4422877 4426673 "Dear Husband, I know you think<br />you're moving through this world unseen.
4426840 4428133 "Don't believe that for a second.
4428300 4430343 "I know where you've been,<br />and I know where you're going."
4433805 4435724 "For this anniversary,<br />I've arranged a trip.
4435890 4437642 "Follow the river, up, up, up.
4437809 4440395 "Sit back and relax,<br />because you are done."
4440562 4441855 What's "up, up river"?
4442022 4444024 "Up the river." Prison.
4444232 4446026 Fucking crazy bitch.
4446192 4447694 That's what this is.
4447861 4450030 She's framing me for her murder.
4450196 4451364 You married a complete psychopath.
4451531 4453491 The morning of our anniversary...
4453700 4457871 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4458038 4460373 I couldn't fake it for another year,<br />another day.
4460540 4461333 Then what happened?
4461499 4462667 Before I could say anything, she said...
4462834 4466087 "I need you to go somewhere<br />and really think about our marriage."
4466254 4467380 She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.
4467547 4468715 So you'd have no alibi.
4468882 4471092 She stage-managed me.
4471384 4474929 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4475096 4476514 I went to the beach,<br />I thought about our marriage.
4476681 4478266 I came back<br />and decided I wanted a divorce.
4478433 4479517 And by the time you got home...
4479684 4481227 She was gone.
4481853 4482604 You fuck!
4482771 4484356 She's good.
4485357 4487233 Part of me was relieved...
4487400 4489694 when I thought she was gone.
4494074 4495784 Punch and Judy puppets.
4498787 4501748 Remember, he beats Judy to death<br />and kills that baby.
4501915 4503041 So I'm Punch.
4504042 4506044 We already knew that, Amy,<br />what's your point?
4507212 4510048 Does Missouri have the death penalty?
4536950 4538368 Hey, neighbor.
4539285 4541663 It's been weeks<br />since I had anyone decent next door.
4542288 4544791 Well, I don't know how decent I feel.
4544958 4547961 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast death metal at 4 AM...
4548128 4550004 we're gonna be best friends.
4550171 4552132 All right. Nice meeting you.
4552298 4553883 I'm Greta.
4554509 4555677 I'm Nancy.
4555844 4557679 Are you going to the marina?<br />I could use some creamer.
4557846 4559139 I'm sorry. I can't.
4559305 4560515 I've got work to do.
4560807 4562851 All right. See you around!
4563143 4565061 You will.
4611024 4616237 Come on.<br />Show me that darling Nicky smile.
4618031 4619908 You asshole.
4635381 4636883 Hey.
4639677 4641429 Nancy.
4643723 4645558 Nancy.
4646559 4648770 It's hot again today.
4651064 4652899 So, where are you from?
4653399 4654567 Let me guess.
4657695 4658530 Nebraska.
4660907 4662116 New Orleans.
4665578 4667956 You know, I am an expert oiler.
4668122 4669791 Oh, I just bet you are.
4669958 4672585 Lotions and balms. Ointment.
4673294 4675088 I would hate<br />for y'all to get tan lines.
4675255 4677257 So sweet.
4678091 4680760 Okay. You know where I'll be.
4683638 4686057 I see we have the same taste in men.
4687767 4689894 I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.
4690061 4693106 Least you could do<br />is not keep his secrets for him.
4694148 4695400 Let me guess.
4695567 4699445 He's trying to watch the big game<br />and you just won't shut up.
4699737 4702448 No, you don't seem<br />like much of a talker.
4702615 4703449 I got it.
4703616 4705952 You caught your boy rubbing up<br />on some hot little skank...
4706119 4707829 and he apologized to you<br />by busting you a good one.
4710498 4711291 Worse.
4711624 4712625 Worse?
4713459 4717046 I went to the bar where he works<br />to surprise him.
4717213 4721926 <i>And out he comes with this girl<br />who had no business being in a bar.</i>
4724888 4726890 <i>On the very first night that we met...</i>
4727140 4731311 <i>we walked by a bakery<br />that was having their sugar delivered.</i>
4732145 4734397 <i>And it was in the air, everywhere.</i>
4734564 4736733 <i>A sugar storm.</i>
4736900 4738902 <i>And before he kissed me...</i>
4739068 4741154 he leaned in...
4742655 4744949 <i>and did this.</i>
4755627 4757962 <i>- And guess what.<br />- What?</i>
4758129 4759839 He did the exact same thing with her.
4764093 4766971 That is the most disgusting thing<br />I ever heard.
4767138 4768848 Thank you.
4783613 4785198 Thanks very much.
4791996 4794290 Well, we've gone mainstream.
4809889 4812892 It's an appeals process,<br />so we will attempt to appeal to them.
4813059 4815186 Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?
4817063 4818356 Nick Dunne.
4818523 4820817 I have been sitting by the phone,<br />my friend.
4824278 4825405 I'm sorry.
4825571 4827281 Do you not believe me?
4827448 4830576 No, I believe you.<br />It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
4830743 4834080 I love it. But, for you, it sucks.
4834789 4837959 But you gotta have a grudging respect<br />for your wife at this point, right?
4838126 4839585 - Are you laughing me out of the building?<br />- No!
4839752 4841379 Are you kidding me? I'm in.
4841546 4842880 I'm way in.
4843047 4845550 You came to the right guy.<br />This is what I do, Nick.
4845717 4849012 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.<br />I win the unwinnable cases.
4849178 4850722 $100,000?
4850888 4852306 We'll figure something out.
4852473 4853349 I'll give you a special...
4853516 4856310 "my wife is skilled<br />in the art of vengeance" rate.
4856477 4857395 Okay.
4857562 4859063 So, what's the plan?
4859230 4860982 Well, right now,<br />it's a "he said, she said."
4861149 4863484 - She's telling a better story.<br />- No, Nick.
4863651 4865486 She is telling the perfect story.
4865778 4868948 So, we need to start today<br />to prepare your defense, should we need it.
4869115 4871492 - And if we decide to go with your version of...<br />- The truth.
4872410 4875621 Then we'll need to realign<br />the public's perception of Amy.
4875788 4877915 Make them stop seeing her<br />as America's sweetheart...
4878082 4881419 and see her for what she is,<br />which a mind-fucker of the first degree.
4881836 4885673 Now, that is a huge realignment.<br />We'll need other voices besides yours.
4885840 4887967 There has to be someone out there<br />that she's screwed with in the past.
4888134 4891095 There's a New York guy.<br />O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
4891262 4893514 Eight years ago,<br />she pressed charges against him.
4893681 4895850 That should be easy to find.
4896392 4899645 Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.
4899812 4901397 She said that he stalked her.<br />He's in St. Louis.
4902982 4905234 You go talk to Tommy,<br />and I'll draw up the contract.
4909530 4912533 I told you, you came to the right guy.
4914744 4915953 Apparently.
4925004 4926672 Tommy?
4926839 4928382 Yeah.
4928800 4930760 - Thanks for seeing me.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4933846 4935556 You're gonna want a drink.
4936099 4937308 Yeah.
4937475 4940144 <i>So, she said you got physical with her.</i>
4940311 4943147 No, dude, she said I raped her.
4943314 4945691 First degree, felony rape.
4946442 4948152 - Did you do it?<br />- Did you do it?
4949320 4951405 I was looking at 30 years to life.
4951948 4953366 - Did you get a trial?<br />- Fuck, no.
4953533 4955618 Do I look like<br />I would do well in the yard?
4955785 4958704 I pled down, man.<br />Sexual assault one, no jail time.
4959122 4960665 - That's something.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4960832 4962125 I've been unemployed<br />for the last eight years...
4962291 4964669 because I have to write "sexual offender"<br />on every job application.
4964836 4967672 I'm on a neighborhood watch list,<br />because I have to register as a predator.
4967839 4971175 I haven't had a date in almost a decade,<br />because if a girl googles me...
4973136 4975054 Could you walk me through what happened?
4975346 4978349 I meet Amy at this party, you know?
4978516 4980017 We click. She's perfect.
4980184 4982395 She's beautiful,<br />she's smart, she's well-read...
4982562 4984730 she's got an ass<br />like a 20-year-old stripper.
4984897 4986566 I think, "What's the catch?"
4986732 4989902 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4990570 4993489 Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?
4993656 4996993 She annexed me.<br />She made me her business.
4997160 5000830 It was just too much.<br />She went out and bought me ties.
5000997 5003082 And we must have gone<br />20 rounds over that.
5003249 5005877 Ties. The whole thing just became...
5006043 5009714 - So, you broke up with her.<br />- No, I just backed away.
5009881 5012550 Gave her some space. No big deal, right?
5012717 5014260 So I thought.
5014427 5016596 Then one night,<br />Amy comes over to my place...
5016762 5019557 with a bottle of bourbon<br />and a bootleg of this band I love.
5019724 5022602 And within two minutes,<br />she's got my pants around my ankles...
5022768 5024228 and she is kneeling down, and...
5024395 5026272 I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.
5026439 5028191 - You had sex?<br />- Yeah, consensual.
5028357 5030443 It was rough,<br />but she was screaming for it.
5030902 5033237 Next morning,<br />there's two cops at my door.
5033571 5036365 Amy has wounds<br />that are consistent with rape.
5036532 5039577 Ligature marks on her wrist,<br />and my semen.
5039744 5043289 It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,<br />and raped her.
5043456 5044790 Me!
5044957 5046584 And then, guess what they find.
5046751 5048794 Headboards of my bed, one on each side.
5049212 5050421 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5050588 5051923 You do know your wife.
5052590 5054300 - Did you ever see her again?<br />- Yeah.
5054467 5055885 On TV, last week, with you.
5056469 5057762 I thought, "There's Amy.
5057929 5061933 "She's graduated from being raped<br />to being murdered."
5065770 5066812 You been watching this, too?
5066979 5068064 <i>Last night's bombshell.</i>
5068231 5069148 We just found out...
5069315 5072151 <i>Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,<br />pregnant when she went missing.</i>
5072652 5075488 <i>Kelly Capitono,<br />this makes me wanna throw up.</i>
5075655 5078491 <i>What is it about a pregnant woman,<br />a woman carrying life inside her...</i>
5078658 5079992 <i>that turns men into animals?</i>
5080159 5081661 <i>Ellen, this is an epidemic.</i>
5081953 5084080 <i>The third leading cause of death<br />among pregnant women...</i>
5084247 5086499 <i>is homicide committed by<br />a boyfriend or husband.</i>
5086666 5089418 <i>Let's not forget about the wife, ever.</i>
5089585 5093506 <i>Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,<br />Noelle Hawthorne.</i>
5093673 5095925 <i>Thanks for being on the show, Noelle.</i>
5096092 5097260 <i>Thank you, Ellen.</i>
5097426 5098803 <i>And let me just say this...</i>
5098970 5102431 <i>Amy would have loved you,<br />and all you do for women.</i>
5102598 5103516 <i>Oh, that's nice.</i>
5103683 5105685 <i>Why don't you tell us<br />about your friend, Noelle?</i>
5105851 5108271 <i>Amy was so nurturing.</i>
5108437 5110690 Oh, I'd love if just once,<br />someone was like...
5110856 5112149 "She was a real rag."
5114652 5117113 <i>She was beautiful and smart and kind.</i>
5117280 5119198 Seems like a rich bitch to me.
5119365 5121867 What do you mean? People love her.
5122034 5124453 I don't know. She seems uppity.
5126163 5128541 Spoiled rich girl,<br />married a cheating asshole.
5128708 5129792 Paid the ultimate price.
5129959 5133296 <i>The only secret was her husband.<br />We never met Nick.</i>
5133462 5134964 <i>He never introduced himself.</i>
5135131 5137383 <i>Why was that, Noelle? Why do you think?</i>
5137550 5138551 <i>I think we know why.</i>
5139343 5141470 <i>Because he had a violent temper.</i>
5141637 5142555 A little harsh.
5142722 5144181 That's life, baby.
5144348 5145641 <i>He knew I'd have<br />seen right through him.</i>
5146851 5148060 Don't get me wrong.
5148227 5149979 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
5150146 5153566 I'm just saying, there are consequences.
5155693 5156569 Fuck, yeah.
5156736 5159030 <i>She was so alone.</i>
5159196 5160990 <i>And she was so innocent.</i>
5161157 5164493 <i>You're a good friend, Noelle.<br />And you're a good friend of the show.</i>
5164660 5165745 <i>Thanks for coming on.</i>
5165911 5167246 Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.
5167413 5169582 Tanner Bolt landed me.
5169749 5172918 I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings<br />on my way home.
5173085 5174920 And, Go...
5175087 5178257 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5178716 5180176 That's just the retainer.
5180551 5184055 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
5184221 5187183 <i>I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house.<br />We will go from there.</i>
5187350 5189101 Thank you.
5189852 5191395 - I love you.<br />- I love you, too.
5191562 5194190 <i>Nick keeps his father,<br />who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.</i>
5194357 5196442 <i>Number of times he visited last year?<br />One.</i>
5196609 5197443 Oh, fuck!
5197610 5200196 <i>His twin sister, Margo,<br />well, she is a peach.</i>
5200363 5202698 <i>These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.</i>

5209789 5211624 <i>While I never examined Nick,<br />or his sister...</i>
5212416 5214543 <i>they both seem very, very close.</i>
5214877 5216128 It's twin-cest.
5216462 5219048 <i>Disturbingly close, Lauren.</i>
5219215 5221092 <i>And so, we close with a question.</i>
5221258 5222635 <i>What kind of moral rot...</i>
5222802 5227390 <i>allows a beautiful, talented,<br />kind, smart, loving mother...</i>
5227556 5231143 <i>to vanish without<br />the heavens hearing our outraged cries?</i>
5231310 5232228 Can I bum a cigarette?
5232395 5236148 <i>Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about you,<br />and we will not forget.</i>
5236649 5238734 <i>And you know what else we won't forget?</i>
5238901 5241153 <i>Missouri has the death penalty.</i>
5241320 5242488 Amen.
5268347 5270516 I'd like to report<br />some strange activity...
5270683 5274186 near the woodshed<br />on the property of one Margo Dunne.
5315394 5316854 Hey.
5322401 5324528 - Mr. Dunne.<br />- Mr. Collings.
5325529 5328491 I know you.<br />I saw you at the volunteer center.
5328657 5330367 I wanted to help.
5331160 5332745 I hope you don't mind me coming by.
5332912 5335998 I got your address from this letter<br />that you wrote my wife.
5336874 5340252 Amy and I believe<br />in the lost art of letter-writing.
5340419 5344256 I always wondered<br />why you kept in touch after...
5344924 5346091 everything.
5346258 5348552 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5348719 5350763 She was my first serious girlfriend.
5350930 5353599 - Why did you break up?<br />- That's a strange question.
5353766 5355601 Did you treat her bad?<br />Did you cheat on her?
5355768 5356852 That's a rude question.
5357019 5358604 Let me tell you what Amy told me.
5358771 5361607 She dumped you,<br />you completely unraveled.
5361774 5363734 You stalked her, you threatened her...
5363901 5367279 and you attempted suicide in her bed<br />and were institutionalized.
5367446 5371242 Your wife is missing,<br />and you came all this way to tell me this?
5371408 5373619 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5377289 5379124 Mr. Collings.
5381210 5383128 Fuck.
5388759 5391637 <i>...the missing persons case<br />of Amy Elliott Dunne.</i>
5391804 5395474 <i>She is the beautiful blonde inspiration<br />for the</i> Amazing Amy <i>kids' book series.</i>
5412658 5414743 You're reading that diary again?
5414910 5415828 You know how it ends.
5415995 5418330 It interests me.
5418497 5419957 Hey, Rhonda.
5420124 5421917 "He's gonna kill me." The end.
5422084 5424086 Why did he go to his dad's house<br />to burn it?
5424253 5425254 It's private. There's no one there.
5425421 5428090 Why didn't he make sure<br />it actually burned?
5428257 5431093 Because he tripped the alarm.<br />You were up his ass with a flashlight.
5431260 5433470 The whole thing just feels hinky.
5433637 5435598 Like finding an envelope marked "Clue."
5435764 5436765 You ever hear the expression...
5436932 5438684 "The simplest answer<br />is often the correct one"?
5439476 5441353 Actually, I've never<br />found that to be true.
5441520 5443314 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
5445983 5446984 Hey.
5456452 5458203 Elvis is in Missouri.
5458370 5460372 Thank God. Come on in.
5460539 5462958 <i>First thing you have to understand about Amy,<br />she loves to teach lessons.</i>
5463542 5465878 - Play God.<br />- Yeah, Old Testament God.
5466045 5466962 Okay. Keep talking.
5467129 5468714 She finds out I've been cheating on her<br />with Andie...
5468881 5470341 decides to teach me a lesson.
5470507 5472301 Fakes her own death, frames me for it.
5472468 5474553 Blood in the house, credit cards,<br />life insurance.
5474720 5475804 She does the treasure hunt.
5475971 5477181 Now, the treasure hunt is critical.
5477348 5480893 She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities.<br />Rubbing my nose in it.
5481060 5482978 And she leaves clue number one<br />for the police...
5483145 5484730 which will lead them<br />back to my office...
5484897 5487316 which is a place<br />where Andie and I would often...
5487483 5488692 And she leaves a pair of red panties.
5488859 5489902 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5490069 5491654 - Clue two.<br />- My father's house.
5491820 5494073 Another place where Andie and I<br />would occasionally have relations.
5494239 5495491 - Clue three?<br />- Woodshed.
5495658 5497034 - Also a location...<br />- Oh, my God.
5497201 5498827 - We had limited options.<br />- A hotel.
5498994 5501372 - Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br />- Put it on Andie's credit card.
5501538 5502748 Andie's statement<br />went right to her parents.
5502915 5505334 Nick, Margo, can we head over<br />to the little brown house?
5505501 5507169 - This leads us to what?<br />- My dad's house.
5507336 5509088 Dad's house is blue.
5510381 5513425 After the divorce,<br />when Dad wasn't coming around...
5513759 5517888 I used to pretend that he was a spy<br />named Mr. Brown, who...
5518055 5521600 for the sake of his children's safety,<br />had to deny their existence.
5521767 5523185 You never told me that.
5523435 5525104 You told her that?
5525270 5527564 We've got incriminating red panties<br />in your office.
5527898 5530275 We've got a Showcase Showdown<br />worth of crap in your woodshed.
5531402 5534613 So, what in God's name<br />is at your father's house, Nick?
5534780 5535739 And be honest.
5535906 5537741 I honestly have no idea.
5544915 5548627 Whatever they found,<br />I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.
5550462 5552715 <i>We got a lot of uncontained issues here.</i>
5552965 5556051 Nick, do you have any idea<br />as to what Andie's mindset is?
5557261 5558929 We haven't communicated since the vigil.
5559096 5560305 Okay. Amy's parents?
5560472 5561932 - No, it's...<br />- More pressure.
5562099 5565227 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will<br />no doubt go public at any moment.
5565394 5566770 - No, Andie won't do that.<br />- She will.
5566937 5568647 They always do.<br />Don't take it personally.
5569148 5571316 Amy's got us in an interesting bind.
5571650 5573819 - We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br />- Really?
5573986 5576155 Right now,<br />Andie just gives you another motive.
5576989 5578157 We need to tell the cops<br />about the woodshed.
5578449 5579742 We need to be on the front end of that.
5579908 5582244 But I'm gonna warn you<br />as to what will happen.
5582828 5583912 They'll go after Margo.
5584079 5584955 They can't do that, can they?
5585122 5586915 She's your accomplice.<br />She helped you hide the evidence.
5587082 5589168 In all likelihood,<br />she knows that you killed Amy.
5590085 5591503 God.
5591837 5593797 Well, what are we going to do?
5593964 5594840 We find Amy.
5595257 5597468 No. Any other strategy<br />is missing the point.
5597634 5599845 I've got two ex-Secret Service guys<br />that are really good.
5600012 5601513 I'll put them on it.
5601680 5603098 But where do they start, Nick?
5603474 5604600 Where would Amy go?
5606769 5608395 I have no idea.
5612858 5615486 Are we keeping score?
5616153 5617529 Hey!
5619156 5622201 I thought we were steering clear<br />of men for a while.
5622367 5623202 He's nice.
5623368 5625871 Because he wants to fuck you.
5627498 5629041 She's still moping about her ex?
5630834 5633504 He got cheated on, too.
5636882 5639635 We three are the<br />saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.
5639802 5641345 I'm not sad.
5641887 5642721 I'm angry.
5642888 5644556 There you go.
5644723 5647226 I almost drank myself to death<br />when my wife left me.
5647392 5649520 I was gonna kill myself.<br />Can you believe that?
5649686 5650687 Don't give him the pleasure.
5650854 5653857 I was going to drown myself<br />in the Gulf of Mexico...
5654024 5656401 let myself be dinner<br />for the great whites.
5656568 5658237 Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.
5658403 5662199 Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.
5662366 5664827 Please put that on a T-shirt.
5673377 5675754 Miss Moneybags.<br />I thought you said you were broke.
5677256 5678549 That's a fat wad.
5680342 5682010 It's mostly singles.
5682177 5684054 Singles? What are you, a stripper?
5684847 5687432 Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?
5688559 5689601 We're just teasing.
5690394 5692187 Don't they tease people down in NOLA?
5694606 5697442 <i>We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest<br />any day now.</i>
5697609 5701196 <i>We've got blood in the house,<br />huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.</i>
5701363 5705200 <i>And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,<br />missing for five days...</i>
5705367 5707494 <i>crying out for justice.</i>
5708287 5709997 <i>We'll be right back.</i>
5762257 5764718 Tanner has a very bad idea<br />he's going to pitch you.
5764885 5765552 Yeah?
5765719 5767179 You're doing Sharon Schieber<br />tomorrow in St. Louis.
5767346 5768221 It could go so wrong.
5768388 5770015 And you are going<br />to tell her about Andie.
5770182 5771350 Nope.
5771516 5773393 That sounds like a very bad idea.
5773560 5775520 You haven't heard from her<br />in three days.
5775687 5779274 This is a ticking time bomb.<br />You've gotta throw yourself on it.
5779441 5781860 - People are gonna hate me.<br />- And then, they will forgive you.
5782027 5784363 A guy admitting that he's a<br />gigantic asshole on television?
5784529 5786198 People empathize with that.
5787616 5789409 - Why don't we just put out a statement?<br />- They need to see you.
5789576 5792537 Sharon's specials,<br />they get 10 million viewers.
5792704 5795082 She is a crusader.<br />If she takes you on as a cause...
5795248 5797042 She's going to ask real questions.
5797209 5798919 I will drill you<br />as if you were doing a deposition.
5799086 5800420 What to say, what not to say.
5800587 5801588 A trained monkey?
5801755 5803799 A trained monkey<br />who doesn't get the lethal injection.
5805133 5808470 Nick, this case<br />is about what people think of you.
5808637 5810263 They need to like you.
5810430 5814267 Now, you do this and you will reach<br />millions of those people.
5815435 5817938 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5827406 5828073 Hello?
5828240 5829449 Hey, baby.
5830909 5832494 One minute.
5841253 5842587 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
5842754 5843588 You clearing out?
5843755 5845465 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5845632 5847092 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5847259 5848176 I'll come by before...
5848343 5850095 Let us give you a hand.
5856268 5858729 Yeah, you gotta<br />clear everything out, here.
5860397 5863108 Dorothy is a real stickler.
5864443 5867738 Not even a spare hanger<br />can you leave behind.
5870323 5871783 Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.
5874411 5875412 A sock...
5876329 5879124 or undies or what have you.
5883962 5885297 You did a real good job.
5887299 5889426 Where is the money, sweetheart?
5893096 5893847 Look under her dress.
5895640 5896767 He talked you into this?
5896933 5898143 I talked him into it.
5898310 5900312 The second you leave,<br />I'm calling the cops.
5900812 5904357 Your glasses are fake.<br />Your hair's dyed all hamster.
5904524 5907486 You say your name's Nancy,<br />but you don't even answer to it half the time.
5907652 5909988 You're hiding. I don't know why,<br />and I don't really care.
5910155 5912199 But you ain't gonna call the cops.
5912532 5914534 And I don't think you've<br />ever really been hit before.
5920832 5922834 Holy shit.
5925879 5928548 Sorry, but we really need the money.
5928715 5930217 Next place, be more careful, okay?
5930383 5932552 There are a lot of people out there<br />a lot worse than we are.
5967337 5968964 Excuse me. You can't sleep here.
5996575 5999661 I did not kill my wife.
6000662 6003832 Why don't you try it again?<br />A little less wooden.
6003999 6005083 I didn't kill my wife.
6006918 6008503 - What are you doing?<br />- Every time you look smug...
6008670 6011214 or annoyed or tense,<br />I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.
6011381 6013216 - That's supposed to make me less tense?<br />- Let's try it again.
6013383 6016678 Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,<br />you and your wife had some bumps.
6017721 6021558 Yeah, we had some tough years.<br />I lost my job.
6021725 6022726 You both did.
6025437 6027189 We both lost our jobs.
6027355 6029774 I had to move back home<br />so we could take care of my mother...
6029941 6032360 who was dying of cancer<br />and my dad, who had...
6032527 6034154 Your dad's scorched earth.
6034321 6035864 Let's talk about your mom,<br />how close you were.
6036031 6037073 Go on.
6037240 6039618 For a while,<br />things had been building up.
6039784 6043163 "Built up" implies that an explosion<br />is coming. No.
6043330 6045749 At a certain point,<br />we got on the wrong track.
6046583 6048084 I had a moment of weakness.
6048251 6050670 Your "moment" was over 15 months.
6054466 6056551 I disrespected my wife.
6057219 6059638 And I disrespected my marriage.
6060096 6061473 And I'll always regret it.
6062224 6062933 That works.
6063099 6065393 Don't be afraid to play up<br />the dufus husband thing, Nick.
6065560 6067145 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.
6067312 6068021 "Everything I do is wrong."
6068188 6070232 I know.<br />What men are supposed to do in general.
6072359 6073276 - Thank you.<br />- How do you feel?
6073443 6076655 I feel good.<br />Go, can you pass me that box, please?
6077072 6079574 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present<br />to me.
6079741 6080617 You hate that watch.
6080784 6082744 No, Go. I love that watch.
6082911 6084788 Just like I love this tie.
6084955 6088083 Just like I love my wife.
6118446 6119698 It's you!
6119864 6121866 It's you.
6122701 6124703 I'm sorry.
6125370 6126705 I'm sorry.
6127622 6129499 Good God.
6129666 6131042 Last week...
6131543 6136715 I threatened to leave, and he said<br />he'd find me and he'd kill me.
6137048 6139217 So, I disappeared.
6140385 6142220 I lost the baby.
6142721 6144389 I couldn't even tell my parents.
6144556 6148476 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.
6149227 6150395 Well, he is looking for you.
6151062 6152897 He showed up on my doorstep<br />three days ago.
6153064 6155567 He tracked me from my letters to you.
6156693 6157902 You saved them.
6158486 6159404 Knowing you were out there...
6159571 6162073 was the only thing that's kept me going<br />these past few years.
6162240 6163491 Let's go to the police.<br />You can explain everything.
6163658 6164826 No, I can't turn up now.
6164993 6168079 I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.
6169914 6172083 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?
6172250 6174085 He should go to prison<br />for what he's done.
6176921 6179257 I'm setting you up at my lake house.
6179424 6180425 It's utterly secluded.
6181843 6183553 Why are you so good to me?
6183720 6184929 You know why.
6185096 6186097 Excuse me.
6186264 6187265 I know you, don't I?
6187432 6188099 No.
6188266 6190101 You're one of the Nolan girls, right?
6190268 6193021 No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.
6193188 6193938 We should leave.
6194105 6195190 Just a second.
6195774 6198902 That was Boney. I'll call her later.
6199069 6200945 Tanner. Nice to see you.
6201237 6202238 Sharon! Hi.
6202405 6203948 Hope this is worth my while.
6204115 6205241 You're gonna be very happy.
6205700 6206368 Sharon.
6206534 6208620 Ms. Schieber.<br />Thank you so much for doing this.
6208787 6210789 Can I get you anything to drink or eat<br />before we get started?
6210955 6212957 No, I had some gummy bears.
6214042 6215627 What the fuck?
6216795 6217921 I'm sorry?
6218338 6222092 <i>We have a major shocking development<br />in the Amazing Amy disappearance.</i>
6222258 6223510 <i>We go live to that story now.</i>
6223676 6224969 Oh, my God.
6227138 6228807 You little slut.
6228973 6231976 <i>My name is Andie Fitzgerald.</i>
6232977 6234521 <i>I met Nicholas Dunne...</i>
6234687 6238191 <i>when he was my creative writing teacher<br />at Mill Valley.</i>
6238358 6240318 Why is she dressed like a babysitter?
6240485 6241820 <i>I am deeply ashamed...</i>
6241986 6244989 <i>of having been romantically involved<br />with a married man.</i>
6245156 6246950 The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.
6247117 6248993 <i>I truly believed we were in love.</i>
6249160 6250995 Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite.
6252497 6253832 <i>I know that is no excuse.</i>
6253998 6255166 No, it is not.
6255333 6259546 <i>I do not, in my heart, believe<br />Nick Dunne would have killed for me.</i>
6259712 6262006 <i>My prayers go out to everyone<br />who loves Amy.</i>
6262173 6265176 <i>I apologize for the pain<br />this has caused them.</i>
6270390 6272350 <i>We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.</i>
6273184 6274561 <i>That love ended today.</i>
6274853 6276354 Come on, you're staring at ghosts.
6276521 6279190 <i>He met our trust with lie after lie.</i>
6279524 6281317 <i>We now absolutely believe...</i>
6281484 6283736 <i>Nick is involved in the disappearance<br />of our daughter.</i>
6283903 6286156 <i>Our Amazing Amy.</i>
6287031 6289159 This just got very exciting.
6289868 6291578 We need a moment.
6293580 6295206 We're gonna have to bow out of this.
6295373 6297041 - Nothing has changed.<br />- Everything has changed.
6297208 6299502 An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?
6299669 6301171 - I can handle this.<br />- We're on the defense.
6301337 6303256 This is a completely different dynamic.
6303423 6306176 - I can handle it.<br />- She's going to eat you alive.
6306718 6308386 Just trust me.
6312765 6314017 Okay.
6314184 6315268 Great.
6316102 6317562 Mic him.
6337290 6339083 One, two, three, four, five.
6345423 6346090 Thank you.
6347592 6348760 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.
6348927 6349928 Yeah, no kidding.
6354599 6357602 Roll tape. Five... four...
6357769 6359395 three... two...
6361606 6364400 Seriously, I can't believe<br />how fucking good you were.
6364567 6365902 - Amy brings out the best in me.<br />- Don't.
6366069 6369113 Keep it together, you two.<br />At least for the next 24 hours.
6369280 6371574 People still hate you.<br />Women want to scratch your eyes out.
6371741 6373493 Andie was really good TV.
6373660 6375578 - She's a good person.<br />- Therein lies the problem.
6375745 6376621 Ride this out...
6376788 6379666 and when Sharon airs tomorrow,<br />we'll be looking at a whole new you.
6379832 6381292 But, until then...
6381459 6383294 don't show your face.
6383461 6385296 No problem.
6401604 6402981 Welcome.
6404983 6406693 Make yourself at home.
6406859 6410697 I've got music, satellite...
6410863 6411698 Netflix.
6411864 6412824 <i>He was her teacher!</i>
6412991 6413783 Roku.
6414534 6417036 Internet, obviously.
6417620 6420206 <i>Here is a supposedly grown man...</i>
6420373 6424043 If there is ever anything you have<br />a taste for and you can't find it...
6424210 6426337 just let me know<br />and I will get it for you.
6426504 6429507 <i>Instead of the A-B-C's,<br />he taught her the birds and the bees.</i>
6429674 6432468 <i>And just think how her mother must feel<br />at a time like this.</i>
6432635 6434637 Wine cellar's downstairs.
6438099 6439350 I'll get you some clothes, too.
6439517 6442937 Not that I don't appreciate<br />Bait Shop Chic.
6444105 6446482 The floors are heated,<br />just dial to your liking.
6446649 6449694 There's robes and towels.<br />The shower has steam.
6449861 6452196 The bathtub has a massage cycle.
6454032 6455950 There's a great view,<br />if you're in the mood.
6456117 6457535 Blackout curtains if you're not.
6457702 6460038 The bed is Savoir.
6460204 6462457 You'll never get a better sleep.
6466336 6468671 This is just what I need.
6470131 6472050 I'm so exhausted.
6473551 6475720 I'll leave you to it, then.
6477472 6480224 Amy, I am so happy that you are here.
6481225 6484228 And I don't want you to worry<br />for one moment.
6484395 6486230 There are cameras everywhere.
6486397 6489150 The exterior, all along the grounds,<br />the entryway.
6489317 6489984 Anyone...
6490485 6492737 who is caught coming or going...
6495990 6497575 will be recorded.
6499160 6501871 You are more than safe.
6503831 6507335 And I am not letting you get away again.
6553089 6554674 - Good morning!<br />- Don't do that!
6556426 6557552 I'm sorry.
6559554 6561055 I need to feel safe.
6561389 6564392 You are very safe.
6566602 6568104 - What have you been up to?<br />- Nothing.
6568271 6570857 Amy, I'm not Nick.
6571023 6573025 It's hard for me.
6575945 6579574 After so many years<br />under someone's thumb...
6581826 6583119 I know just what that feels like.
6584036 6586038 You were never under my thumb.
6586622 6588541 - On your leash.<br />- Never.
6588708 6590209 A new start.
6591502 6593129 Decent clothes.
6594046 6596299 Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.
6596591 6598092 There's a gym overlooking the lake.
6598468 6601888 The sooner you look like yourself,<br />the sooner you'll feel like yourself.
6602054 6605057 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br />Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.
6605224 6607769 I think that's something<br />I should watch on my own.
6608186 6609896 Nonsense.
6613524 6614942 I'll be back.
6616569 6618613 And I am looking forward...
6618780 6621699 to my reunion with Amy Elliott.
6644889 6646057 Great.
6647099 6649060 <i>Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.</i>
6649227 6650853 <i>- Tonight, exclusively...</i><br />- Hurry up.
6651771 6656025 <i>A husband breaks his silence,<br />not just on his wife's disappearance...</i>

6667578 6670039 <i>I probably am.<br />And I probably deserve it.</i>
6670206 6671666 I bought that tie.
6671833 6673751 <i>Did you kill your wife, Nick?</i>
6673918 6677004 <i>I did not kill my wife.</i>
6677672 6679090 <i>I am not a murderer.</i>
6679257 6681050 <i>But you were unfaithful.</i>
6681217 6683302 <i>I was unfaithful.</i>
6683469 6685012 <i>And I am deeply ashamed.</i>
6685179 6687515 <i>And, on top of that,<br />you allowed Amy's parents...</i>

6690601 6695398 <i>believe you were a loving husband,<br />desperate to find his missing wife.</i>
6695565 6697316 <i>Well, I am desperate<br />to find my missing wife.</i>
6697483 6700361 <i>You say that, but I'm wondering<br />how you expect us to believe you...</i>
6700528 6702238 <i>now that we know you're a liar.</i>
6702530 6705533 <i>I didn't come forward with my affair...</i>
6705700 6708870 <i>because I knew it would make me look<br />really, really bad.</i>

6715793 6720089 <i>Just because I am not a murderer<br />doesn't make me a good guy.</i>
6720256 6721424 <i>I'm not a good guy.</i>
6721841 6724302 <i>I was a bad husband to a great wife.</i>
6724677 6726429 <i>I broke the vow that I made to her.</i>
6726679 6729223 <i>Those are pretty words, Nick.</i>
6729557 6731183 <i>But what does that really mean to you?</i>
6731350 6733394 <i>It basically means<br />that I was a con artist.</i>
6734353 6737440 <i>I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.</i>
6737607 6739191 <i>I was completely transfixed.</i>
6739650 6741444 <i>Amy can do that to you.</i>
6741611 6744030 <i>I was this average guy<br />from an average place...</i>
6744196 6746073 <i>with mediocre aspirations.</i>
6746240 6748618 <i>And I met a woman who dazzled me.</i>
6748784 6750620 <i>And I wanted her to love me...</i>
6750786 6753122 <i>so I pretended to be better than I was.</i>
6753998 6757543 <i>When we got married,<br />I promised to be that guy.</i>
6757710 6759420 <i>That guy who works harder.</i>
6759587 6761672 <i>That guy who, who lives and acts...</i>
6761839 6764759 <i>and loves with as much passion<br />as she does.</i>
6765009 6766218 <i>But I failed her.</i>
6767136 6768262 <i>Instead of doing what was right...</i>
6769764 6770932 <i>I did what was easy.</i>
6771682 6775186 <i>You talk like a man who believes<br />he can make amends to his wife.</i>

6777021 6778314 <i>She is still alive.</i>
6780191 6783027 <i>Will you look at that camera for me?</i>
6783361 6786197 <i>Will you look in the lens...</i>
6786364 6788199 <i>and talk to your wife?</i>
6788366 6791327 <i>If she is out there,<br />able to hear and see you tonight...</i>
6791494 6794163 <i>what would you like to say to her, Nick?</i>
6797708 6800002 <i>Amy, I love you.</i>
6800711 6803381 <i>You're the best person I've ever known.</i>
6803547 6807885 <i>And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br />for the way that I've treated you.</i>

6836539 6838582 What does it say?
6838749 6840167 <i>...I think we can all agree...</i>
6840334 6841711 Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.
6841877 6842920 <i>...there's more to him<br />than meets the eye.</i>
6843087 6844046 They're going crazy for you.
6844213 6848592 They disliked me, they liked me,<br />they hated me.
6848759 6850261 And now they love me.
6850428 6853264 <i>...a candor and an honesty<br />that's worthy of respect.</i>
6853431 6855349 <i>He's certainly earned mine.</i>
6856183 6857268 What is it?
6860104 6863274 <i>I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.</i>
6868195 6870865 Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant<br />for your property.
6871032 6873117 I usually ignore tipline calls...
6873284 6877872 but a neighbor was concerned about<br />a strange man around your woodshed.
6878289 6879123 Call Tanner.
6879290 6880458 Okay. Fuck!
6884587 6886047 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.
6887298 6888132 Is that what this is about?
6889800 6894430 I have treated you more than fair<br />throughout this entire investigation.
6894597 6896766 I gave you the benefit of the doubt<br />over and over.
6896932 6898309 Every time you said something stupid...
6898476 6900728 I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."
6900895 6903314 But I was wrong.<br />That's what this is about.
6903481 6904482 Are these the clubs<br />you don't play golf with?
6904648 6905441 None of that is mine.
6905941 6907401 None of this was put here by me.
6907568 6910988 Those are nice clubs.<br />You got the makings of a real man cave.
6911155 6914158 Everything just waiting<br />until the wife goes away for good.
6914325 6915409 Nick!
6916660 6919580 - You can't do that!<br />- Of course we can.
6927880 6930341 Amy, it's time to move on.
6930508 6932218 What can I do to help?
6932927 6934345 I need some time to think.
6934512 6936889 - That's the last thing you need.<br />- Desi...
6937056 6939517 Twenty years,<br />you have kept me dangling.
6939683 6943354 Finally, last night, you came to me,<br />and you chose me.
6944063 6945272 Follow that instinct.
6945439 6947858 Don't trust the instinct<br />that left you beaten and homeless...
6948400 6951570 sleeping in your car,<br />fearing for your life.
6954907 6957618 I'm not gonna force myself on you.
6960037 6962706 I understand what you're saying, Desi.
6963958 6965584 I do.
6968921 6970923 I've been so mistreated for so long.
6973592 6976470 I've forgotten how to behave.
6982226 6984395 I'll move in here tomorrow...
6984562 6987148 and we'll work it out together.
6989233 6992945 I just want you to be you again.
7000786 7002163 <i>They only took Margo to fuck with you.</i>
7002329 7003914 She's not spending<br />another fucking second in there.
7004081 7006834 I'm gonna go in,<br />and I'm gonna tell them everything.
7007501 7009253 What?
7011255 7012756 We tell Boney very little.
7012923 7014925 Without a body,<br />without a murder weapon...
7015092 7017261 their only hope is a confession.
7017428 7019263 So, you let them do all the talking.
7019430 7021432 That way,<br />we can jump-start your defense.
7021599 7023976 The truth is my defense.
7029940 7030774 Recognize these?
7030941 7032943 Yes.<br />It's Amy's anniversary present to me.
7033110 7034778 Was that how she told you<br />she was pregnant, Nick?
7034945 7037448 Mommy, Daddy, baby,<br />and that made you real mad?
7037948 7039116 No.
7040367 7042119 - Recognize this?<br />- Never seen that before in my life.
7042703 7045956 It's Amy's diary.<br />We found this at your father's house.
7047958 7049126 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7049293 7051170 - He's not a handwriting ex...<br />- Looks like it.
7051337 7052463 Our experts thought so, too.
7053797 7055507 Do you wanna<br />play a little true or false?
7056258 7057343 Sure.
7057509 7061972 "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips<br />so he can taste me."
7063098 7065100 Yeah, that's true.
7066352 7068354 You thought quinoa was a fish?
7069647 7070981 That is also true, yes.
7073150 7075152 She wanted to get pregnant,<br />you assaulted her.
7075319 7077196 I hit her? No, never happened.
7077363 7078864 - "Pushed," it says "pushed."<br />- Absolutely not.
7079031 7080115 I never touched her.
7082534 7084161 She tried to buy a gun.
7084828 7086705 I doubt that, but I don't know.
7088123 7089625 Shall I read the last entry?
7089792 7090834 Sure.
7092127 7094129 "This man may kill me."
7094296 7096382 In her own words,<br />"This man may kill me."
7096548 7098676 It's kind of a convenient end note.
7105182 7106475 For future reference...
7106642 7108852 the truth,<br />you are not a handwriting expert.
7109019 7110062 Okay, I know.
7118487 7120322 Judy's missing handle.
7121865 7124034 Big as a two-by-four, right?<br />Big as a club.
7124201 7126829 We found this day one,<br />in the fireplace in your home office.
7126996 7129540 We didn't know what the hell it was,<br />but fire in July?
7129707 7130416 We bagged it.
7130582 7131583 I've never seen that before either.
7131750 7134253 We just tested it.<br />Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7134420 7136505 So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...
7136672 7138173 you're under arrest<br />for the murder of your wife.
7138340 7139425 Do not say another word.
7139591 7140926 - What about my side?<br />- Nick!
7154273 7155607 More coffee?
7155774 7157568 I'd love it.
7159862 7163365 Remember that time we skipped school<br />and drove to the Cape?
7163532 7165951 God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.
7166118 7167745 This reminds me of that.
7168245 7169913 Never-ending holiday.
7171457 7173542 You're not bored?
7173709 7175085 Desi, how could I be bored?
7175252 7177588 You can discuss<br />18th-century symphonies...
7177755 7180674 19th-century Impressionists,<br />quote Proust in French.
7181050 7185054 Nick's idea of culture<br />was a reality TV marathon...
7185220 7187097 with one hand down his boxers.
7189099 7190684 I really have to get going.
7191018 7194355 But I will be back<br />just as soon as I can.
7200944 7202029 My keys.
7207242 7209244 Thank you.
7220464 7222049 That's how the kids wear it.
7282860 7286697 Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.
7289533 7290701 Hey.
7291118 7293370 - Are you okay?<br />- Yes. Are you?
7293537 7294663 Yeah.
7294830 7296707 Let's go.
7298542 7299626 What does this mean?
7299793 7301837 Well, you're out on bond.
7302004 7305215 You can relax at home<br />while we prep for trial.
7310721 7312723 Keep your head down.
7328155 7330407 Tanner, is there<br />any fucking lead on Amy?
7330574 7332576 I've got two of my best guys on it.
7333076 7334703 She's air.
7336747 7339708 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7396932 7399351 Mr. Collings is home.
7399518 7401770 Hello, Mr. Collings.
7401937 7403689 I've missed you.
7403855 7405482 I've been thinking...
7405941 7408110 I don't wanna be without you.
7408819 7411029 Stay with me.
7411196 7414032 And when all this dies down,<br />we'll go to Greece, like you said.
7414199 7416493 Octopus and Scrabble?
7418495 7420622 How long do you think until it's done?
7420789 7424376 Not long. Six months for the trial.<br />Sentencing will be quick.
7424876 7425836 He'll appeal.
7426003 7428130 I can watch the rest overseas.
7445522 7446690 Go slowly.
7446857 7447733 But I want it.
7468211 7469671 Don't rush.
7469838 7471923 Just do it.
7480390 7481933 Harder.
7580490 7583660 You fucking bitch.
7592335 7596006 Don't you worry,<br />you're gonna have lots of babies.
7597632 7601011 Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br />There was semen present.
7601178 7602179 We'll make sure it's a match.
7602345 7603972 Yeah, it'll match.
7604139 7606475 Thank you very much.
7606641 7608018 What do you think?
7608185 7609352 Are we pals again?
7609519 7612939 Now that I know<br />you didn't murder your wife, yes.
7613106 7613940 What do you think?
7614107 7617027 Kidnapping? The story's insane.
7619196 7621531 She's on fairly heavy painkillers.
7621698 7623492 It's okay. I want to help.
7623658 7624951 Ms. Dunne, I know<br />what you've been through...
7625118 7627329 so we'll keep this very brief.
7627496 7629873 Can you walk us through what happened?
7632501 7635128 That morning, the doorbell rang.
7636004 7637881 So normal.
7638048 7639883 I opened the door.
7640509 7642344 So strange.
7642969 7646473 Since high school,<br />he won't ever go away.
7646640 7649601 And I've just tried to be nice to him.
7649768 7651394 Answer his letters.
7651645 7653647 Keep him calm.
7655065 7656525 Oh, my God.
7657150 7658652 I've encouraged him.
7658819 7660612 You can't blame yourself.
7662239 7664407 He pushed inside.
7665992 7668036 And he grabbed me.
7668745 7671832 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.
7672165 7673875 And he clubbed me.
7674334 7675627 I collapsed.
7675794 7679714 That club was actually the handle<br />to a Punch and Judy puppet.
7679881 7681299 Right.
7682217 7683635 Treasure hunt.
7685554 7687472 I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...
7687639 7689349 Then how did Desi have that handle?
7691226 7693144 I'd just found it.
7693895 7696314 It must have fallen off.
7698233 7701778 I was holding it when Desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7701945 7703029 About that woodshed...
7703196 7704865 He took me to his lake house.
7705448 7707033 Tied me to his bed.
7707200 7709619 Back to the woodshed real quick.<br />Real quick.
7709786 7711496 When you went<br />to place the puppets there...
7711663 7712914 did you notice that it was packed...
7713081 7714124 Lots of stuff.
7714291 7718587 Corresponding to purchases made<br />on credit cards in your husband's name.
7718753 7720130 Nick and credit cards.
7720297 7722716 He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.
7722883 7725677 He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.<br />They're very close.
7726219 7730432 Now, may I go back<br />to where I was being held prisoner...
7730599 7733226 by a man with a history<br />of mental problems?
7733393 7734269 Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
7738773 7740859 Desi assaulted me that night.
7741818 7743653 Every night.
7744779 7747198 He tied me up like a dog.
7748575 7751077 And then, he'd punish me.
7752996 7755040 Starve me.
7756333 7758251 Shave me.
7759878 7761838 Sodomize me.
7762631 7764341 There were cameras everywhere.
7764507 7767469 Please find this. Please find the tapes.
7769137 7772349 She slit his throat with a box cutter.
7773433 7775518 How did she manage<br />to get a hold of a box cutter...
7775685 7778271 if he had her tied up the whole time?
7779230 7781274 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7782067 7783902 Amy, we found your diary.
7784069 7788031 It contains many concerning allegations<br />of mental and physical abuse.
7788198 7791076 Well, it's the ugly truth.
7791910 7793411 Nick didn't want a baby.
7795246 7798541 He has a temper. We had money problems.
7799459 7800460 But I love him.
7800627 7802379 Then why did you try to buy a gun?
7804339 7806299 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7806466 7808176 If I could just clarify one thing...
7808343 7811429 If this case had been left<br />in your deeply incompetent hands...
7811596 7813473 my husband would be on death row...
7813765 7817519 and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...
7817811 7821481 Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.<br />We're finished.
7822357 7824401 Now, I have to ask you...
7824567 7827404 do you feel safe<br />going home with your husband?
7839833 7842335 We prayed to God,<br />and God has answered our prayers.
7842502 7843753 Amy Dunne is home.
7843920 7845880 Now, I know there are<br />a lot of questions and concerns...
7846047 7847924 but for right now, we wanna sit tight...
7848091 7853013 and just be thankful and grateful<br />for this miracle on the Mississippi.
7860478 7862272 Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.
7914032 7915241 We love you, Amy!
7919871 7921581 All right, you can stop pretending now.
7921748 7923416 I'm not pretending.
7924125 7925835 You were perfect.
7926461 7928880 The Nick I saw on TV,<br />that's the Nick I fell in love with.
7929047 7931633 You do know I was just telling you<br />what you wanted to hear, right?
7931800 7933510 That's how well you know me.
7933676 7936304 You know me in your marrow.
7937305 7938765 Okay.
7938932 7942268 You need to tell me<br />exactly what happened.
7943561 7944813 Take off your clothes.
7945313 7948525 I need to make sure<br />you're not wearing a wire.
7961830 7965708 You killed someone, Amy.<br />You're a murderer.
7965875 7967335 I'm a fighter.
7967502 7969838 I fought my way back to you.
7970004 7971673 You killed a guy.
7971881 7973716 You slashed his throat<br />with a box cutter.
7973883 7978555 You went on national television<br />and begged for me to save your life.
7979139 7980265 And I obliged.
7980431 7981891 But I want that Nick.
7982225 7983518 I'm leaving.
7983685 7986312 You really think that's smart?
7986980 7987939 Shampoo.
7990692 7994487 Wounded, raped wife battles her way<br />back to her husband...
7994654 7996406 and he deserts her.
7996573 7997615 They'll destroy you.
7998366 7999742 Neighbors will shun you.
7999909 8004122 And I'll make sure that no one forgets<br />the pain you caused me.
8006207 8011296 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8011880 8013506 Once they go...
8014382 8015175 I go.
8015341 8018761 Give it the night. Sleep on it.
8035612 8037197 Was there ever a baby?
8037488 8039574 There can be.
8043578 8044579 Good night.
8097507 8099175 Hey, Nick!
8111312 8112563 Hello, handsome.
8115692 8117443 Crepe?
8118152 8118945 Sure.
8119112 8120697 <i>She was his dream girl.</i>
8120863 8124158 <i>And when this spoiled, rich,<br />entitled little boy couldn't have her...</i>
8124325 8125702 <i>he took her.</i>
8133084 8134419 You must be so proud.
8141676 8143678 It's been four hours.
8144178 8147015 Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?
8151185 8154022 Right now, it's all about our marriage.
8154856 8158234 When two people love each other<br />and can't make that work...
8158401 8160820 that's the real tragedy.
8164574 8166617 Kiss my cheek.
8172957 8175710 I can't believe that fucking spider<br />is America's sweetheart.
8175793 8177879 She told me she killed Desi.
8178046 8179255 Not self-defense. Murder.
8179422 8180840 - Can't we get a wire?<br />- That's not gonna work.
8181007 8182050 She told you once before.
8182216 8184427 Yeah, because she had me strip naked,<br />and stand in the shower.
8184594 8187722 I swear, you two are the most<br />fucked-up people I've ever known.
8187889 8189349 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8189599 8191309 You and Amy under the same roof?
8191476 8193269 You should pitch that<br />as reality television.
8193895 8196147 <i>Amy Dunne,<br />and the Miracle on the Mississippi.</i>
8196314 8198691 <i>Nick and I have been through<br />some bad patches.</i>
8198858 8200068 <i>We've had our dark days.</i>
8200234 8202070 <i>But we thank you so much...</i>
8202570 8207116 <i>for supporting us in our new life together,<br />for forgiving Nick.</i>
8207367 8210953 <i>Really, your encouragement<br />means the world.</i>
8211120 8212413 She's good.
8212580 8215041 <i>Amazing Amy and the Humbled Husband.</i>
8215208 8217168 <i>The Real Housewives of Branson.</i>
8217335 8218294 Take care of this guy, will you?
8218461 8219837 I can't believe you're just leaving now.
8220088 8221506 You are not at risk anymore.
8221672 8223049 I'm the definition of "at risk."
8223257 8227261 You got a book deal, a Lifetime movie,<br />you franchised The Bar.
8227428 8228471 You may wanna thank her.
8231516 8232934 Just don't piss her off.
8233768 8234519 See you, guys.
8236896 8238439 Elvis has left Missouri.
8238606 8239565 She had to have made a mistake.
8239732 8241901 We need to check Amy's story,<br />piece by piece.
8242068 8243945 Nick, I can't do anything.
8244362 8247073 We had the national spotlight on us,<br />we stained the rug.
8247240 8248825 The case is with the Feds now,<br />they're done.
8248991 8250034 That doesn't mean you have to be done.
8250451 8252245 It does.
8283818 8285278 What are you doing?
8287196 8288656 Couldn't sleep.
8288823 8289490 Come on...
8290116 8292285 let me tuck you back in.
8304964 8307592 You know you can sleep with me, right?
8309677 8311637 Yeah, it's just...
8311804 8313139 I need more time.
8313347 8316893 I would never, ever hurt you.
8318686 8321022 I do need you to participate, though.
8321189 8323357 I need you to do your part.
8333659 8334410 Okay.
8335411 8338206 Everything you have heard<br />about my wife...
8338289 8339540 is a lie.
8339707 8343794 She is a calculating,<br />murderous psychopath.
8344420 8345838 And I have been complicit...
8346005 8347131 Nick!
8352803 8354847 Nick? Breakfast.
8355014 8355848 Honey?
8359560 8361896 We should hold hands.
8362063 8365149 Not the entire time,<br />but on and off throughout.
8366567 8368778 "So, Nick, how does it feel<br />to have your wife back?"
8371405 8373157 "It's fantastic.
8373324 8376244 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8376410 8378120 "Fantastic" is a little flippant.
8378538 8379539 "Amazing"?
8379705 8382416 I need you<br />to admit that you got the credit cards...
8382583 8385586 and that you hid all that stuff at Go's<br />and that you pushed me.
8386337 8389382 I'm gonna need<br />those three things to feel safe.
8390591 8392426 You have to own this, Nick.
8393219 8396764 Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.
8398349 8400101 Nick.
8403062 8405690 What a beautiful home.
8406941 8409485 I so appreciate<br />you giving us this time, Nick.
8409652 8411696 You went on national television...
8411862 8414198 and told people that I murdered my wife.
8414365 8415491 I go where the story goes.
8415658 8418494 You implied that I had carnal relations<br />with my sister.
8418661 8422081 I didn't use the "I" word.<br />I said you two were "extremely close."
8422248 8426919 You and a panel of nitwits<br />diagnosed me as a sociopath.
8428129 8429880 Ice-breaker.
8433593 8435261 To go with your robot dog.
8435428 8437471 I'll go find Amy.
8439515 8441601 She's downstairs.
8444103 8445605 - What is it?<br />- It's for you.
8445771 8447189 Open it.
8447481 8449108 I don't need any more gifts from you.
8449275 8450985 Open it.
8463539 8465082 I didn't touch you.
8465249 8466167 You didn't need to.
8466334 8469420 Bullshit. That notice of disposal.
8469587 8470963 I have that. You threw it out.
8471130 8472965 The notice, yes.
8473341 8474216 I want a blood test.
8474759 8475843 I want a paternity test.
8476636 8477845 I love tests.
8478012 8479722 You can teach those people<br />to hate me all you want.
8479889 8482600 I don't care. I am leaving you.
8484727 8487313 I won't have to teach your child<br />to hate you.
8487480 8489732 He'll do that all by himself.
8489899 8491776 You fucking cunt!
8493653 8495905 I'm the cunt you married.
8496072 8497740 The only time you liked yourself...
8497907 8501452 was when you were trying to be someone<br />this cunt might like.
8501619 8505081 I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.
8508834 8512088 I've killed for you.<br />Who else can say that?
8513339 8515758 You think you would be happy<br />with a nice Midwestern girl?
8515925 8518636 No way, baby. I'm it.
8518803 8522098 Look, you're delusional. You're insane.
8522264 8523766 Why would you even want this?
8524141 8525101 Yes, I loved you.
8525267 8528604 And then all we did was resent each other,<br />and try to control each other.
8528771 8529772 And cause each other pain.
8530314 8532108 That's marriage.
8534777 8537154 Now, I'm getting ready.
8562471 8565433 <i>I can't watch you play house<br />with that thing for the next 18 years.</i>
8565599 8567143 I can't just walk away.
8567309 8568769 You could get custody.
8568936 8572690 No, I won't. And you know it.
8572857 8575359 It's gonna be my child.<br />I'm not gonna leave it.
8575985 8577653 You wanna stay.
8577820 8581615 I have a responsibility.<br />It's not about what I want anymore.
8581782 8583033 You wanna stay with her.
8593669 8594712 You're breaking my heart.
8595171 8598674 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8598841 8601218 I need you with me on this.
8601385 8603846 Of course I'm with you.
8606474 8610478 I was with you before we were even born.
8612229 8615024 We've been through the darkness.
8615566 8618861 We've come out, united.
8621864 8624033 We communicate.
8626327 8628704 We're honest with each other.
8628871 8630372 Right?
8632291 8634794 We're partners in crime.
8638172 8639006 And?
8640883 8642218 And?
8645721 8647640 We're gonna be parents.
8649350 8650976 My goodness!
8651393 8653354 - How exciting!<br />- Thank you.
