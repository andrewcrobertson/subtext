23173 24213 When I think of my wife...
26593 29103 I always think of her head.
30555 33465 I picture cracking her lovely skull...
33516 35766 Unspooling her brains...
35810 38440 Trying to get answers.
39648 43148 The primal questions of any marriage.
43193 45533 "What are you thinking?"
45570 47820 "How are you feeling?"
47864 50494 "What have we done to each other?"
145462 149472 The Irish prince<br />graces us with his presence.
151134 154264 His majesty prefers not to be moistened.
155472 156762 I got you a present.
158350 159810 - I hated this game.<br />- You loved it.
159851 161141 You loved it.
161186 163476 Thank you.<br />I'll add it to the collection.
164272 166442 Can you pour me a bourbon?
172697 174777 What's up, jitters?
178495 180835 Well, if you're not going to talk,<br />I'm gonna have to fill the silence...
180872 184252 With another excruciating story<br />by margo dunne.
184292 186962 I could tell you about<br />my recent customer service experience...
187003 189013 - Changing Internet service providers.<br />- I like that one.
189047 191917 Or how about the time I saw that woman<br />who looked exactly like my friend Monica?
191967 193887 But it wasn't Monica.<br />It was a total stranger.
193927 195847 Who was also named Monica.
196304 198024 - Made it kind of interesting.<br />- It's great.
198640 199970 I'm just having a bad day.
200016 201976 - Amy?<br />- It's our anniversary.
202018 203978 - Five years.<br />- Five?
204020 205190 That came fast.
205230 206560 And furious.
211111 214201 I'm so crazy, stupid happy.
217033 218493 I met a boy.
218535 222965 A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.
225208 226498 Excuse me, miss?
226543 228003 I just want you to be careful...
228044 230844 Where you put down that<br />monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
230880 233590 Because the party's down to three<br />beast lights and a bottle of pucker.
233633 235343 It might attract<br />some desperate characters.
235385 238225 It could.<br />I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa.
242309 244849 They already relieved me<br />of my artisanal meat platter.
244894 247774 Finally, someone tells me<br />how to pronounce that word.
247814 248814 "Meat"?
248815 250065 Yes, "meat." One syllable.
250400 253070 Thank you. Whose beer am I<br />about to drink?
253111 254401 Don't tell me.
255071 256741 Let's see, who's your type?
257157 258237 I don't see you sitting quietly...
258283 261873 While he bloviates<br />on his postgrad thesis about proust.
261912 264212 Uh-oh. Is that him?
264247 266528 Ironic hipster, so self-aware,<br />he makes everything a joke.
266750 269750 I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."
271588 272918 What type are you?
272964 274424 Corn-fed,<br />salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.
274466 275586 Missouri?
275634 276554 Cute.
276593 278933 - Native new yorker?<br />- The world ends at the Hudson.
278970 280050 What's your name?
280096 281096 Amy.
281097 283427 Well, Amy, who are you?
284768 287938 A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.
287979 292149 B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.
292192 295322 C, I write personality quizzes<br />for magazines.
295695 299905 Okay. Your hands are far too delicate<br />for real scrimshaw work...
299950 303200 And I happen to be a charter subscriber<br />to middling warlord weekly...
303245 304455 So I'd recognize you.
304788 306118 I'm gonna go with "c."
306164 307584 And you?
308416 309956 Who are you?
310001 314341 I'm the guy to save you<br />from all this awesomeness.
318426 321256 So, you write for a men's magazine.
321304 324564 God, does that make you an expert<br />on being a man?
324599 325679 No.
326476 327797 It's what to wear, what to drink.
327811 329771 How to bullshit.
329813 331403 Never with you.
331439 332269 Ha, ha.
332315 333935 No, I mean it.
333984 335784 It's hard to believe you.
335819 336609 Why?
336653 338283 I think it's your chin.
338321 339451 My chin?
339489 342159 Yeah, it's quite villainous.
342200 343830 Okay, how's this?
344828 347998 A hundred percent true, no bullshit.
348373 349373 Okay.
349374 350964 We all move to New York...
351001 355131 And we end up living in these little<br />cubby holes, and that's not it.
355171 358631 Come outside. Then, you're in it.
361052 362802 You have to see this.
371354 372444 Hey.
372480 373480 Hey.
382449 384199 I have to kiss you now.
384242 385662 Is that right?
385702 388872 I can't let you go through<br />a sugar storm unkissed.
390707 391867 Wait a second.
394586 396046 There you go.
407974 409394 Nick dunne...
411144 413234 I really like you.
419402 421652 So, is Amy gonna do<br />one of those anniversary...
422614 423914 Treasure hunts?
423949 425949 You mean the forced march<br />designed to prove...
425992 428952 What an oblivious and uncaring asshole<br />her husband is?
428995 430075 Wow.
432916 434626 Life. I don't remember the point.
434668 436878 Deep hasbro thoughts.
436920 438250 Spin.
439089 441299 What was the clue last year<br />she got so mad about?
441341 444641 "When your poor Amy has a cold...
444678 446388 "This dessert just must be sold."
446429 447429 The answer?
447430 449220 I still don't know the answer, go.
449266 451426 - A few years ago, you'd have known.<br />- A few years ago, it was fun.
451476 453136 Year one,<br />the traditional gift was paper.
453186 456646 She got me a beautiful notebook.<br />Told me to go write my novel.
456690 457570 What did you get her?
457607 458977 A kite.
459025 460855 - She'd never flown a kite.<br />- Okay.
461820 464410 Anyway. Year four, flowers.
464447 467697 She led me outside<br />to the dying rosebush in the backyard.
468034 469084 That's symbolic.
469119 470119 Yeah.
470120 471580 What's the gift for five?
471621 472411 Wood.
472455 474915 - So, what did you get her?<br />- There's no good gift for wood.
474958 478288 I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,<br />slap her with your penis.
478336 479796 "There's some wood for you, bitch."
483341 484631 The bar.
485385 487805 Why, yes. Hang on one second.
487846 489006 Hey, it's watchful Wally.
491308 493308 Hey, Walt. What's going on?
495687 498767 Thanks very much. I'll be right there.<br />All right, bye-bye.
510994 513664 Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?
514873 516373 Thanks, Walt!
532057 533427 Ame?
553787 555247 Amy!
567926 568926 Hello?
569094 570554 Come on in.
571114 572114 Hey.
572138 573558 - Mister dunne.<br />- Hi.
573598 576098 I'm detective Rhonda boney.<br />This is officer James gilpin.
576142 578102 We understand there are concerns<br />about your wife.
578144 582064 I don't know where my wife is.<br />And I came home to this.
583108 585898 Now, I don't panic easily...
586236 588316 But it's weird, right?
589573 590573 Mind if we look around?
590759 591759 Please.
591783 593063 How long have you two been here?
593076 595906 Two years in September.<br />We used to live in New York.
595954 597044 City?
597080 600210 Yeah, I was a writer.<br />We were both writers.
600250 601880 Why did you all move back here?
601918 603538 My mom got sick.
603587 606547 Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?
606590 608050 She's dead.
608091 609091 I'm so sorry.
614806 617096 What do you do now, for work?
617976 619806 My sister margo and I<br />own the bar downtown.
620270 622110 Oh, the bar.
622147 624397 Love the name. Very meta.
624441 625531 Thanks.
628486 630276 Pretty things.
635035 636375 Stay.
636411 638161 My office, here.
641207 643247 Beautiful dress.
647065 648065 Date night?
648089 649339 It's our anniversary.
652510 654010 It's a guest bedroom, there.
654304 655934 Cat's room on the end.
655972 657522 I checked up here.
661895 662985 This is the kitchen...
663021 664361 Obviously.
680121 681961 This is my wife's office.
681998 683618 Amy's office.
696680 699720 Wow. Impressive gal.
699766 700976 Yeah. Should I be concerned?
701017 702187 I remember these.
703436 704686 I loved these books.
708858 710278 Wait a minute.
710318 712318 Your wife is amazing Amy?
712904 715244 Yeah. She is.
715282 716912 Wow.
719911 723541 Amazing-fucking-Amy<br />is getting fucking married.
723582 725372 That's how the night started.
725417 731507 With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br />jealous, as always, of the golden child.
731548 736138 Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,<br />who's getting fucking married.
736469 738259 When I was 10, I quit cello.
738305 741895 In the next book,<br />amazing Amy became a prodigy.
744352 745352 Did you play volleyball?
745395 747275 I got cut, freshman year.
747314 749234 She made varsity.
750650 752650 When did you have a dog?
752694 753694 She got the dog.
754321 756821 Puddles made her more relatable.
756865 758205 Wow.
758241 760371 I love your parents...
760410 762200 But they really can be assholes.
762245 763695 - Nick!<br />- Sir!
763747 765537 Hey, thanks for coming, man.
765582 766372 No problem.
766416 767826 Hey, sweetheart.
768418 769838 Big night for your mom.
769878 773708 It would mean so much<br />if you would talk to a few reporters...
773757 775627 Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.
775675 777545 People wanna hear from you.
777594 779224 - We can't stay long.<br />- Fantastic.
779262 781432 Fifteen minutes, tops.
781765 786065 This is why I have my brownstone.<br />My trust fund. I know I can't complain.
786102 788732 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
788772 792822 No, they improved upon it,<br />and then peddled it to the masses.
792859 795069 I thought you were gonna wear white<br />to match the wedding theme.
795111 796571 I thought that would be creepy.
796613 799073 "If it's worth doing,<br />it's worth doing..."
799115 801445 hold up! I know how this ends.<br />Don't tell me.
801493 803293 You're very cute, Nick.
803328 804968 Amy, you know<br />what would make dad's night.
804996 806616 I'm on it.
807916 810916 I love having strangers<br />pick at my scabs.
810961 812211 I'm curious whether...
812254 813964 It's difficult for you to see<br />amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
814589 817429 And this big party<br />celebrating this fictional wedding.
817467 819797 Because it's my understanding<br />you are not married.
819844 821514 Is that correct?
822472 826232 Correct. Amazing Amy has always been<br />one step ahead of me.
826268 830098 Excuse me. I'm sorry,<br />I just have a few questions.
830415 831415 It's you.
831439 833979 I'm here in a<br />strictly journalistic capacity.
834276 837606 Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br />of dating Nick dunne for how long?
837654 840454 - Two magical years.<br />- Two magical years.
840490 842330 In the course of that time,<br />you've had the opportunity...
842367 844827 To perform such gracious gestures as...
844869 848789 Not correcting Nick when he<br />pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
848832 850292 An understandable mistake.
850333 851533 He also thought it was a fish.
851543 853133 He thinks velveeta is a cheese.
854170 856460 You also manage to appear<br />shocked and delighted...
856506 859086 When Nick's elderly mother<br />breaks into an impromptu rendition...
859134 861344 Of New York, New York,<br />every time she sees you.
861386 863426 [S]These bag of bone shoes
863471 864641 that's just frightening.
864681 867311 You also bought Nick<br />his very first pair of scissors.
867350 869020 And matching stapler.
869060 871980 Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.
872022 875532 You are brilliant,<br />yet entirely un-snobby.
875567 879197 You challenge me. You surprise me.
879237 880567 And, fun fact for the readers...
880989 882699 You have a world-class vagina.
885493 887833 My colleagues tell me<br />that you are not yet married.
888371 890161 Is that correct?
890206 891666 I'm not.
891708 893038 Isn't it time we fixed that?
894502 896172 And then...
896212 899052 The night wasn't so bad anymore.
915398 917898 And it's done. Crossed off the list.
917943 921903 Now, normally, we would not treat this<br />as a missing persons case so quick...
921947 923387 But given the scene at your house...
923406 925526 And given our spike<br />in violent crime of late...
925575 928035 We are gonna take this<br />very, very seriously.
928078 929078 Okay. Good.
929079 932369 We've got forensics over at your place.<br />You got somewhere to stay?
932415 933995 - I could stay at my sister's.<br />- Okay.
934042 936342 We're tracking Amy's phone,<br />her credit cards.
936378 938048 We will organize searches,<br />put up flyers.
938088 939731 We're gonna hold a press<br />conference tomorrow.
939757 941088 You're having a<br />press conference?
941132 942722 I wanna get the word out, right?
942759 947049 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,<br />I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.
955105 957275 Time is of the essence in these cases.
957315 960065 But, that said,<br />do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?
960110 961240 Absolutely not. I just wanna help.
961278 963068 So, you and Amy<br />have been here two years.
963113 966373 - You tend bar...<br />- I own the bar.
966408 969908 And I teach creative writing at mvcc.
969953 971753 - No kids?<br />- Not yet.
971788 973248 So, what does Amy do most days?
973290 975500 A woman with all those degrees,<br />what does she do?
976001 977421 I don't know. She keeps busy.
977460 978960 Doing what?
981172 982802 She's a voracious reader.
982841 985681 So, she's always got a book in her hand.
986761 988221 Well, days can get long.
988263 992103 I know a few housewives, that evening<br />glass of wine starts coming at noon.
992142 993432 Or prescription pills.
993476 994976 Just last week, we had a soccer mom.
995020 997480 Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in<br />over some oxycontin.
997522 999612 Ever since that mall went bust,<br />half the town is out of work.
999649 1001149 We cannot keep up<br />with the drug violence.
1001192 1003612 I'm pretty sure that's not it.
1003653 1005493 Has Amy got friends we can talk to?
1007490 1008780 No, not really.
1008825 1010785 No friends? This whole town?
1010827 1014457 She was very close with my mom,<br />before she passed away.
1014497 1016617 You know, we have a pretty serious<br />homeless problem...
1016666 1017786 In our neighborhood.
1018126 1019886 I think maybe you guys<br />should check that out.
1021171 1022171 We'll look into that.
1022213 1024843 You got to the bar around 11:00 today.
1024883 1026473 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that out.
1026509 1027509 Well, I was home.
1027510 1030140 I left at 9:30,<br />I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.
1030180 1031810 I went to Sawyer beach<br />and read the news.
1031848 1034018 Did you visit with anyone there?
1034059 1036019 I kind of go to Sawyer beach<br />for the solitude.
1037187 1039767 So, your wife has no friends here.
1039814 1041654 Is she kinda standoffish?
1041691 1044111 Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?
1044152 1045652 She's from New York.
1046821 1050161 She's complicated.<br />She's got very high standards.
1050200 1051200 Type a?
1051368 1053948 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1053995 1056825 You seem pretty laid-back. Type b.
1056873 1059043 Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?
1059584 1061384 God, I don't know.<br />I'd have to look it up at the house.
1061419 1064209 You don't know if she has friends,<br />you don't know what she does all day...
1064256 1066166 And you don't know<br />your wife's blood type.
1066216 1067336 Sure you all are married?
1069094 1070094 Maybe it's type o.
1070095 1072315 - Where are her folks? New York?<br />- Yeah.
1072347 1074057 Can they get here time<br />for this press conference tomorrow?
1074099 1076139 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1076184 1078024 You haven't called<br />your wife's parents yet?
1078061 1080481 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1080522 1082982 Call them, please, Nick. Now.
1083024 1084234 Fine.
1089739 1091699 Should I know my wife's blood type?
1091741 1092741 No.
1093076 1096866 I apologize, marybeth.<br />I didn't know what was going on.
1096913 1098413 Now I'm at the station...
1098456 1101956 And the cops are at the house,<br />and it's serious and I'm calling you.
1102669 1105629 There's a lot of things<br />that are being juggled right now.
1105672 1108932 I'm standing right next to<br />detective Rhonda boney...
1108967 1110927 Who's the lead investigator on this<br />and she's...
1113179 1115349 My mother-in-law<br />would like to speak with you.
1116766 1118056 This is detective boney.
1118101 1119441 I wanna go home.
1119477 1121937 I don't know why I have to be here.
1121980 1124610 I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.
1124649 1125779 Dad?
1126192 1127782 This is my father. What's going on?
1127819 1128859 Really? You're Nick dunne?
1129112 1131112 We've been trying to get a hold of you<br />all afternoon.
1131156 1132816 I've been right there.<br />My wife is missing.
1132866 1133986 - Bitch.<br />- Don't.
1134034 1136414 Your father wandered out of comfort hill<br />after lunch.
1136453 1138833 We found him walking route 79,<br />disoriented.
1138872 1140332 We've been trying to call you<br />for the last...
1140373 1141623 I don't get a cell signal<br />in this building.
1141666 1143626 I've been sitting<br />20 feet away from you.
1143960 1145590 Sir, please<br />don't take that tone with me.
1145629 1146749 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.
1146796 1148336 Dad, stop.
1151009 1152219 You wanna drive him home?
1152886 1155176 I think that would be wise. Thanks.
1174741 1177831 This voice mailbox is currently full.
1178745 1179745 Fuck.
1181873 1184463 Get your fucking hands off me.
1184501 1185881 Thanks.
1198682 1202852 Everyone told us<br />and told us and told us...
1202894 1205484 Marriage is hard work.
1205522 1208572 And compromise and more work.
1208608 1210858 "Abandon all hope, ye who enter."
1210902 1213822 "When young Amy's hope did wane...
1213863 1215203 "She wandered here..."
1215240 1217740 Well, it's not true.<br />Not for me and Nick.
1217784 1220414 "...In search of Jane."
1220453 1223373 With us, two years...
1223623 1225043 It's just good.
1225542 1227382 Austen.
1228878 1232878 You were an alienated teen<br />and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.
1233383 1235383 Look at that.
1237220 1238600 My God.
1239097 1240387 You naughty minx.
1240432 1243522 Well, technically, we are supposed<br />to fuck at the next stop.
1243560 1245190 Yeah, in keeping with tradition.
1245228 1248728 But I might be willing<br />to bend the rules this once.
1248773 1250483 God bless Jane Austen.
1265832 1269842 I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br />It's confirmed by the...
1272797 1275087 Thank you.
1276134 1277594 Year two. Cotton.
1284351 1288601 We had that joke that our sex<br />was too good for ordinary.
1288647 1291107 So, these are 2,000 thread-count...
1296154 1299074 we're so cute.<br />I wanna punch us in the face.
1299115 1302325 That's pretty great.<br />I mean, that is pretty great.
1303787 1305247 Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?
1305288 1307458 I don't need a lawyer.<br />Here, I'll do this.
1307958 1309918 Well, did they ask personal stuff<br />about Amy?
1309960 1311130 You know, they asked...
1311461 1312921 Why didn't she have any friends?
1312963 1313803 What did you say?
1313838 1315838 - I said she was complicated.<br />- Nick!
1316841 1319471 Everyone knows "complicated"<br />is code for "bitch."
1324891 1326681 God. I feel sick.
1326726 1328136 Thanks.
1329145 1330435 It's so bizarre.
1330480 1332980 It seems like the kind of thing<br />that would happen to Amy.
1333024 1334194 She always attracts...
1334234 1335824 drama?
1336653 1338033 You can say it. It's just me and you.
1338071 1340621 Just because<br />I don't like to be around Amy...
1340657 1342097 Doesn't mean I don't care about her.
1344995 1347165 Anyway, whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.
1356506 1358546 Detective? Excuse me.
1358592 1361222 I'm noelle hawthorne.<br />I'm Amy's best friend.
1362345 1365005 Well, great. Where do you live, noelle?
1365557 1367057 Five doors down. 1032.
1367100 1369310 Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.
1369352 1371232 Can I come by in half an hour?
1371271 1372981 - Y'all know anything yet?<br />- I'm sorry.
1373023 1375823 I got guys on the clock in here.<br />But you give me 30 minutes.
1375859 1377189 But that's usually bath time.
1377944 1380534 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.
1383283 1384583 All right. So, what do you got?
1384618 1387248 It was definitely blood spatter<br />you saw in the kitchen.
1387746 1389406 Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.
1389456 1391826 Not that weird,<br />but that is awfully high.
1391875 1393505 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.
1393543 1394713 Well, okay.
1397422 1398512 Interesting.
1398548 1399668 What's that?
1399716 1403216 House is rented in her name.<br />Car's in her name.
1403261 1406391 Credit cards, utilities,<br />phone bill, all in her name.
1406431 1408271 Even his bar's in her name.
1408308 1410228 I don't know that that's so surprising.
1410268 1411888 No. But it is humiliating.
1411937 1412847 What you got?
1412896 1415726 It's with her unmentionables.
1428078 1430958 Well, we have our first clue.
1442050 1443720 I have to take a shower.
1443760 1445550 No, don't. You've been up all night.
1445595 1447755 You wanna look<br />like you've been up all night.
1449391 1451731 Hey, be careful today, okay?
1451768 1453098 That's a weird thing to say.
1453144 1456904 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.<br />You can seem angry, like...
1456940 1458440 please don't say, "like dad."
1458483 1461243 Or else you swing into your momma's-boy<br />charm offensive and that can feel glib.
1461278 1462068 Perfect.
1462112 1464862 I'll balance on the exact fucking edge<br />of your emotional razor.
1464906 1466736 Okay. Just be...
1466783 1468703 Myself?
1468743 1471083 Sponsoring a raffle to<br />benefit west county 4h...
1471121 1474581 And raffling season tickets for<br />mizzou football.
1474624 1477924 Buy your tickets at the wing hut or<br />local tri-state tire stores.
1482507 1483837 Your in-laws made it.
1485844 1486894 - Hi, rand.<br />- Hey, man.
1486928 1487758 I'm detective boney.
1487804 1489764 I'm the twin. Margo.
1489806 1492886 We played tennis yesterday, Nick.<br />I just can't get over it.
1492934 1494274 Marybeth, I am really sorry.
1494311 1496101 I knew you never should have<br />moved back here.
1496146 1497266 We didn't have a lot of choice.
1497314 1500984 We are all worried. We are all scared.
1501026 1505486 But we are all here now.<br />And we will find Amy, together.
1515707 1517627 Should I just go first, and then<br />you guys can say something?
1517667 1518667 Good.
1520295 1524635 As you know, my wife,<br />Amy elliott dunne...
1524674 1527474 Disappeared from our home<br />on the morning of July 5th...
1528428 1530968 Under suspicious circumstances.
1531014 1532474 Louder!
1532515 1536935 If anyone out there<br />has any information...
1536978 1539308 Please come forward.
1539356 1540976 Thank you.
1543318 1546148 I'm rand elliott.<br />My wife, marybeth elliott.
1546196 1547277 Should I have said my name?
1547864 1549824 Amy is our only child.
1549866 1553866 She's bright, she's beautiful.<br />She's kind.
1554371 1555871 She really is amazing Amy.
1556206 1558916 You know, there are<br />millions of people out there...
1558959 1561499 Who grew up with her and care about her.
1561544 1564174 We care about her, we love her.
1564881 1567471 And we just want her back.
1569386 1572006 Amy is a decorated scholar.
1572055 1575025 She forged a successful career<br />in journalism.
1575058 1577348 She returned here<br />to her husband's hometown...
1577394 1579734 And she made a life in her adopted home.
1580814 1583194 Now, Amy needs your help.
1583233 1587363 We're establishing a volunteer<br />headquarters at the drury lodge.
1587404 1592744 We have a hotline, 1-855-4-Amy-tips.
1592993 1598413 And our website is<br />www.Findamazingamy.Com.
1598915 1600875 - Mr. dunne!<br />- Mr. elliott!
1602252 1604092 Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play?
1605839 1609509 Mr. elliott, when was the last time<br />you spoke to your daughter?
1611011 1612011 Smile.
1618602 1620192 That's all for now. Thank you.
1622772 1625612 Amy is the kind of girl<br />who attracts admirers.
1625650 1626530 Right, Nick?
1626568 1627738 Yeah, definitely.
1627777 1630277 And we've had instances...
1630322 1632372 - Where things got...<br />- Scary.
1632407 1633867 Do you know about desi collings?
1633909 1635579 Yeah, I know all about desi collings.
1635619 1636869 He was obsessed.
1636912 1640252 He attempted suicide after Amy<br />broke up with him sophomore year.
1640290 1641830 We had to file a restraining order.
1641875 1644255 This would be high school?<br />Twenty years ago?
1644294 1647514 But he recently moved to St. Louis.<br />That's just two hours away.
1647547 1649417 To be fair, he is from St. Louis.
1649466 1651086 We also have Tommy O'Hara.
1651134 1653344 This is only eight years ago,<br />in New York.
1653386 1655676 She broke up with him,<br />he got very physical.
1655722 1657402 - She filed charges.<br />- What was the charge?
1657432 1659522 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?
1659559 1661519 I only know it was bad.
1661561 1663351 - I didn't know this.<br />- Okay.
1663396 1665306 Thank you.
1665357 1666647 Anything more recent?
1669986 1671986 Not that I know of.
1674449 1677369 Hey, Nick? You got a minute?
1678536 1680156 Yeah.
1685543 1686923 Imagine our confusion.
1686962 1688132 A missing persons case...
1688171 1690761 And in your wife's dressing room,<br />we find an envelope marked "clue."
1690799 1693049 That's for our anniversary.
1693093 1695393 My wife does these treasure hunts.
1695428 1697808 I'm hoping you can tell me<br />what this means.
1697847 1698847 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?
1699266 1701586 It'll help me track Amy's movements<br />before she disappeared.
1701810 1703980 Of course. Okay.
1704020 1706610 "Although this spot<br />couldn't be tighter...
1707357 1710067 "It's a cozy room<br />for my favorite writer."
1712904 1714114 I know this one!
1714614 1718124 Although this spot<br />couldn't be any tighter...
1718743 1721543 It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
1723039 1726459 After-school meeting,<br />don't mind if I do.
1726501 1729421 Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.
1733466 1735796 Well, well. What does it say?
1735844 1737354 Clue two.
1738471 1741851 "Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.
1742350 1746230 "You'll be the spy,<br />and I'll be his lover.
1746730 1747770 "Let's head on over...
1747814 1749694 "To the little brown house.
1749733 1753443 "We'll play hot, doting husband,<br />sweet, loving spouse."
1756489 1757489 These yours?
1758116 1759116 No.
1759159 1760619 But you read the first clue.
1760660 1763790 Randy Professor, naughty student.
1763830 1764870 I blush.
1764915 1766675 Me and my ex just swapped cards.
1767876 1769246 Where's this little brown house?
1769294 1770804 I have no idea.
1814005 1815375 Hello?
1816049 1817929 Nicholas dunne.
1818593 1821683 Under my father's name, William dunne.
1828103 1832193 My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?<br />Can you just turn the bell...
1832232 1833232 yeah, I know.
1833233 1834863 It's... it's...
1837320 1839610 It's "puddles," right?<br />Or is it "poodles?"
1843535 1845165 We're good.
1846746 1847866 Hello, stranger.
1847914 1850044 Fancy meeting you here.
1850083 1852383 It's your dad's house, right?
1852419 1854049 Are you following me?
1854087 1854957 What you doing?
1855005 1857175 Like you said, it's my dad's house.
1857215 1859925 I come by once a week,<br />make sure the place hasn't burned down.
1861720 1863010 But it looks okay.
1863763 1865643 I'll walk you out.
1868893 1870393 You know...
1870437 1873687 I thought maybe<br />this was the little brown house.
1873732 1874942 From the clue.
1874983 1876943 Nope. Still blue.
1893418 1897628 Picture me,<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.
1897672 1901382 I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished," I mean "had."
1901885 1905015 It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.
1905305 1909065 "So open the door, and look alive."
1910352 1911392 Bitch!
1915106 1918106 Want to test your marriage<br />for weak spots?
1918777 1920237 Add one recession...
1920570 1921860 Subtract two jobs.
1922447 1924567 It's surprisingly effective.
1924616 1927026 Promise me we'll never be like them.
1927077 1928197 Like who?
1928245 1930005 All those awful couples we know.
1930038 1933998 Those wives who treat their men<br />like dancing monkeys...
1934042 1935502 To be trained and paraded.
1936127 1938837 Husbands who treat their wives<br />like the highway patrol...
1939214 1941804 To be out-foxed and avoided.
1946554 1948224 I think I'm gonna be laid off.
1949015 1951805 We're in a recession.<br />If it happens, we'll deal with it.
1951851 1954061 I'll probably be next.
1954104 1955354 We have each other.
1955730 1958270 Everything else is background noise.
1959359 1961149 You are exceptional.
1968868 1970118 My turn.
1971997 1975457 My parents' publisher dropped them,<br />and they're in debt up to their ears.
1975500 1976330 That's terrible.
1976376 1978796 And they need to borrow<br />from my trust fund.
1978837 1980337 How much?
1980380 1982590 Almost a million.
1983174 1984764 That's almost all of it.
1984801 1987101 This is where you say,<br />"everything else is background noise."
1987137 1988177 Amy, if you're laid off...
1988346 1989596 And I'm laid off...
1989639 1990769 I said I'd do it.
1990807 1992057 Without talking to me?
1992100 1993680 - Well, it's...<br />- Your call.
1993727 1995307 Their money, technically.
1999733 2001403 You know what? You're right.
2002027 2004027 Everything else<br />is just background noise.
2012996 2013996 Hey.
2018126 2019286 More games?
2019336 2020956 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.
2022172 2023632 What's the laptop for?
2024716 2025716 Laptop-ing.
2027905 2028905 I see.
2028929 2031929 You can give your parents $879,000<br />without talking to me...
2032474 2035104 But God forbid I buy a video game<br />without getting your permission.
2035143 2036193 You are spending a lot.
2036227 2038477 You don't trust me.<br />You don't trust my judgment.
2038521 2040082 You certainly don't trust my intention.
2040106 2041066 What are you talking about?
2041107 2042727 That's the basic tenet<br />of a prenup, isn't it?
2042776 2045026 Why are you throwing that<br />in my face again?
2045070 2046610 Because it's easy to throw.
2046655 2047455 Nick, I don't get it.
2047489 2050829 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2050867 2053947 The nagging shrew.<br />The controlling bitch.
2053995 2056365 I'm not that person. I'm your wife.
2056414 2057584 I'm sorry.
2057624 2059964 I just don't know how to do this.<br />I've never not had a job.
2060001 2062001 I flipped burgers, I painted houses.
2062045 2064055 You'll get another job.
2068468 2069678 Hi, go.
2071429 2073179 What? Hold on. What?
2073223 2074643 - And suddenly...<br />- Slow down, what is it?
2074683 2076683 I knew everything<br />was about to get worse.
2076726 2078306 Okay, tell me what's wrong.
2105672 2107172 - Bless you, Nick.<br />- Father.
2107841 2109261 Hey, tom. Mayor!
2109301 2110551 Nick, good to see you.
2110594 2111594 Good to see you.
2111636 2112886 Hey, guys, hey.
2115307 2116807 - Jodie.<br />- Nick.
2118518 2120138 Oh, we'll find her.
2135118 2136828 You look like hammered shit.
2136870 2138540 Thank you.
2146630 2148350 You ever see that guy<br />in the glasses before?
2149007 2151757 Don't worry. We videotape everybody<br />that comes in and out of these things.
2151801 2153591 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...
2153637 2154677 Do-gooders?
2154721 2155931 Freaks.
2155972 2157932 Hey, I meant to ask you.
2157974 2159434 Noelle hawthorne?
2160310 2162030 She lives on your street.<br />Amy's best friend.
2163146 2164476 I've never heard the name<br />noelle hawthorne.
2164522 2166692 She and her husband have triplets.
2166733 2167733 Oh.
2168026 2170856 Yeah, we might say hi to them<br />on the street.
2171238 2173408 But "best friend"? No.
2173949 2175159 Excuse me, one sec.
2179454 2181544 He acted like<br />noelle was a complete stranger.
2181581 2182671 Of course he did.
2183041 2184331 Look, these two are yours.
2184376 2186746 Oh, look. He's being a good guy...
2186795 2188715 So everybody can see him<br />being a good guy.
2188755 2190545 You really don't like him, do you?
2190590 2192090 What's to like?
2213780 2217410 This mailbox is currently full.<br />Press one to...
2217450 2220830 Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.<br />My name's shawna Kelly.
2221079 2223789 I am so sorry for your troubles.
2223832 2224753 Thank you. That's kind.
2224791 2226211 Are you remembering to eat?
2226251 2227381 Well, a lot of cold cuts.
2227419 2231589 I'm gonna fix you up<br />my world-famous chicken frito pie.
2231631 2233151 That's very kind and very unnecessary.
2233174 2234804 You have to keep your strength.
2235343 2236343 Would you...
2237220 2239100 Say, "chicken frito pie!"
2243310 2244600 You know what?
2245854 2247234 Would you delete that picture for me?
2247272 2249152 - It's a nice photo.<br />- I know it is.
2249190 2250610 But just do me a favor.
2250650 2252400 Will you?
2252444 2255364 Would you go ahead<br />and please delete that picture?
2255405 2256405 You just press...
2256448 2257948 What is wrong with you?
2257991 2259281 Could you please not<br />share that with anyone?
2259326 2262656 I will share it with whomever I please.
2266458 2267828 - Dude.<br />- Yeah?
2267876 2269206 Marybeth is pissed.
2269920 2270920 Why?
2273590 2275170 Marybeth?
2275216 2278636 It's like you're the goddamn<br />homecoming king.
2281056 2283516 It was important to my mother<br />that I be polite...
2283558 2285478 I be considerate, I be a gentleman.
2285518 2287228 It looked like you were having fun.
2287270 2289520 I am in a nightmare!
2290231 2292651 All I'm trying to do is be nice...
2292692 2296402 To the people who are<br />volunteering to help find Amy.
2298365 2300125 You're right.
2300992 2302952 And I'm sorry.
2304955 2308585 My God, this place literally<br />smells like feces.
2319552 2322892 In your searches,<br />did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?
2322931 2324351 No.
2325475 2327185 How about a brand new stratocaster?
2327227 2328347 No, nothing like that.
2329062 2331152 Well, all right.
2336152 2339202 How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.
2339239 2340529 No, it's nowhere near that.
2340574 2341664 Okay.
2342117 2343527 - Kibble?<br />- Excuse me?
2343577 2345657 He asked me to feed his cat.
2345704 2346914 I saw some in the pantry.
2347247 2351997 Detective boney, officer gilpin?<br />Noelle hawthorne!
2352043 2353633 I know y'all are in there!
2353670 2358170 Would you please escort miss hawthorne<br />and her children back out to the street?
2359050 2361140 Detective boney!
2361177 2365007 Just remind her<br />it is a possible crime scene.
2373732 2378572 Look at that pie-eating grin,<br />from a guy whose wife is missing.
2384367 2385947 - How are you doing?<br />- Terrific.
2387704 2389214 How's marybeth?
2389247 2391077 She's a wreck.
2391124 2392584 And you?
2393209 2394839 Awesome.
2394878 2395878 Hey...
2395879 2397459 Have you told me everything?
2397714 2398714 Of course.
2398715 2399715 Everything?
2399716 2400876 Why would you even ask me that?
2400926 2405096 Ever since you walked into the bar that<br />morning Amy went missing, you seem...
2406389 2407389 - Off.<br />- I am off.
2408433 2411773 Everybody's examining me<br />and projecting their shit on me.
2411811 2415231 All I want is to come over here,<br />have a beer with you...
2415273 2416613 And not be judged.
2416650 2418150 Can we do that?
2419236 2420566 Of course.
2421947 2423947 You know what I keep thinking?
2423990 2425030 If mom were here?
2425075 2428495 Yeah. Like I'm 12.
2429955 2432755 Nick, mom would fix it.
2439965 2443185 I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.
2446096 2448426 - Love you.<br />- Love you.
2452769 2454809 So, here's a strange, new sentence.
2454854 2458324 I am a missourian.
2465115 2466495 Bye, dad.
2468410 2471870 No money, no jobs, no prospects.
2471913 2474083 And then, we heard from go.
2474124 2476044 Mama Maureen...
2476084 2478924 Stage 4 breast cancer.
2481089 2483929 So, we moved to Missouri.
2483967 2485587 I don't mind.
2485635 2488805 I just wish he'd asked.
2500483 2502943 Nick is happy to be home.
2502986 2505486 But I don't know<br />if he's happy I'm with him.
2506990 2510240 I feel like something<br />he loaded by mistake.
2510285 2513455 Something to be jettisoned,<br />if necessary.
2513496 2515706 Something disposable.
2517542 2520172 I feel like I could disappear.
2564172 2566172 Oh, my God!
2566216 2568176 - I saw you on TV.<br />- Okay.
2568218 2569888 - It's so crazy.<br />- Yeah, I know.
2569928 2572138 - She just vanished?<br />- She's just gone.
2572180 2574020 - I've been so worried about you.<br />- Where have you been?
2574057 2575887 I called you a hundred times.<br />You gotta pick up your phone!
2575934 2576984 Rehearsals.
2577018 2578058 What?
2578103 2579403 Godspell.
2581231 2582821 My sister's asleep in the other room.
2582857 2583977 I needed to see you.
2584025 2585685 I know this is a bad idea.
2585735 2587235 Can you at least tell me you love me?
2587279 2591029 I do love you, but we have<br />to be really careful right now.
2591074 2592334 I've been so scared.
2592367 2593577 Between rehearsals?
2593618 2595368 You told me<br />I needed to have my own life.
2595412 2596912 I know.
2596955 2598215 We need to stop.
2598248 2599418 I need you.
2600542 2602382 Touch me.
2605797 2608417 Stop it. Come here.
2609801 2611511 Sit down.
2611553 2612893 Okay.
2612929 2617019 Did you, by any chance,<br />tell anybody anything about us?
2617058 2618558 Even in texting, or on Facebook.
2618602 2621402 Facebook? I use the disposable phone.
2621438 2623358 You buy my presents in cash.<br />I'm not stupid, Nick.
2623398 2626278 I know, sweetie. Did you leave a<br />pair of red panties in my office?
2626318 2629738 I don't know. Maybe.<br />They better be mine.
2629779 2630779 Sweetheart, think.
2630780 2633240 I don't know. I'd have to check<br />my red panty inventory.
2633283 2635913 Andie, I need you<br />to take this seriously, okay?
2635952 2637752 This is the last time<br />we're gonna see each other, until...
2637787 2639247 Until when?
2639789 2641249 Until it's safe.
2641291 2642881 You were going to get a divorce.
2642918 2645088 Never say that out loud again.
2645128 2647798 Okay. I'm sorry.
2648673 2649673 I don't wanna fight.
2651676 2653256 I just wanna be with you.
2653303 2654473 Andie, please...
2655305 2656975 That's all I want.
2658308 2659388 I can't.
2661728 2663978 It's our last time together.
2664022 2666072 Let's make the most of it.
2672822 2676162 Real quick, but then you have to go.
2678995 2681785 My husband has come undone.
2681831 2684791 We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...
2684834 2687554 But as it turns out, we couldn't.
2690840 2692590 It means a lot that you came.
2693760 2695140 We took a hit on the brownstone...
2695178 2697508 And I used the last of my trust fund<br />to buy him a bar.
2698265 2700525 So far, it's just costing money.
2704729 2708519 Nick uses me for sex when he wants.
2711695 2714205 Otherwise, I don't exist.
2715448 2717528 We should go to outback tonight.
2717576 2718826 That would be nice.
2718868 2721948 Last night, I went from desperate<br />to pathetic.
2722872 2726042 I became someone I don't even like.
2726084 2727884 The kind of woman I used to mock.
2728295 2730005 You're out so much.
2730046 2732376 - I know.<br />- Stay home.
2732424 2734764 - I can't, I'm already late.<br />- Then, can I come?
2734801 2736591 You would hate it.
2736636 2739886 It's a bunch<br />of my dorky high school friends.
2740890 2743770 Do our code. No bullshit.
2744227 2746597 I thought<br />we weren't gonna be that couple.
2753111 2754951 Okay, bye.
2756615 2759585 - Hey, I've been thinking.<br />- Yeah?
2759618 2760988 Something positive.
2762412 2763452 Maybe it's time.
2764748 2766578 Now is literally the worst time.
2766625 2767865 It would be a new start for us.
2768084 2770804 And for me,<br />I would have a real purpose here.
2770837 2772047 A child is not a hobby.
2772088 2773088 Not a hobby.
2774090 2775300 An inspiration.
2775842 2778972 We could have had this fight<br />four hours ago. I'm late.
2779012 2780262 I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.
2780305 2783725 You really wanna be the couple<br />that has a baby to save their marriage?
2783767 2784767 "Save"?
2785268 2787438 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!
2787479 2789649 - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br />- Yeah!
2789689 2792229 You're a fucking coward.
2792275 2794145 No, it can't go on like this.
2794194 2795244 Really?
2795278 2796778 - I won't.<br />- You won't?
2796821 2799161 You won't?<br />Why, it's not good enough for you?
2799199 2800119 It's not even close!
2800158 2802288 You stupid bitch!
2802869 2805829 What scared me<br />wasn't that he'd pushed me.
2805872 2809712 What scared me was how much<br />he wanted to hurt me more.
2810043 2812133 What scared me<br />was that I'd finally realized...
2813129 2816799 I am frightened of my own husband.
2828687 2830187 You want me to call for backup?
2830230 2832320 Nah, I'll protect you.
2840073 2841493 Jesus.
2846538 2849208 They ought to burn this place down.
2849666 2851326 Seems like folks are trying.
2856840 2859130 You really think this is anything?
2859175 2861335 Cross it off the list.
2872439 2874149 Hey, Jason.
2874190 2875730 What's up, Rhonda?
2875775 2878025 "...and dedicated to the proposition<br />that all men..."
2879112 2881612 - Have you seen this girl around here?<br />- Why do you ask?
2881865 2883705 She was reported missing.
2886870 2888750 "...and so dedicated, can long endure."
2888788 2890708 Yeah. I remember her.
2890749 2892879 What did she want? Weed, pills?
2894544 2895554 She wanted a gun.
2895795 2897835 I told her it's not my thing.
2897881 2900881 I felt bad, though.<br />She seemed really desperate.
2900926 2904506 She said it needed to be small,<br />so she could keep it close.
2904554 2906394 Are you sure this is her?
2906431 2908561 You don't forget a girl like that<br />in here.
2909559 2911059 She was all in pink.
2911102 2913652 It was Valentine's day.
2916608 2919358 For Valentine's day,<br />I thought I'd buy a gun.
2919402 2921992 That is how crazy I've become.
2923073 2927203 Nick wants me gone<br />but he won't ask for a divorce.
2927244 2931374 In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,<br />his only line of credit.
2931414 2932924 The bitch with the prenup.
2934751 2937091 I could go home to my parents...
2937128 2939548 But I'd have to tell them the truth.
2939589 2943429 And I don't even know<br />if I believe the truth.
2943468 2946258 Can I really think Nick would hurt me?
2946888 2949268 I'm being paranoid. Crazy.
2950600 2951600 It's just...
2952560 2955100 I'd sleep better with a gun.
2965991 2967411 Oh, shit.
2967450 2971080 Wake up, baby.<br />My sister's gonna come out here.
2975458 2977668 - Sorry to rush you.<br />- It's okay.
2979629 2981129 - Here. Let me help you.<br />- Okay.
2981172 2983262 Just get that.
2985927 2987427 Be very careful.
2988263 2989263 I'm all right.
2989306 2991886 Here you go.
2991933 2993813 Promise me we'll talk every day.
2993852 2995102 Okay, we will.
2995145 2997865 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.
2998648 2999728 Don't go crazy.
2999774 3001034 Okay.
3005447 3008777 You fucking idiot.
3008825 3012655 You fucking asshole!<br />You fucking lied to my fucking face!
3014164 3015714 I'm sorry.
3017500 3018500 How old is she?
3018835 3020035 She's in her early 20s.
3020962 3021962 How long?
3022505 3025295 - A year and a half.<br />- You lied to me for over a year?
3025342 3027022 If I told you,<br />you would have made me stop.
3027052 3028642 It's so fucking small.
3028678 3031638 You're a liar and a cheat!<br />You're just like dad!
3031681 3032971 How did you even meet her?
3033016 3034226 She's one of my students.
3035477 3037147 I thought writers hated clichés.
3037187 3038017 I'm not a writer.
3038063 3040313 "Boo-hoo, I got laid off.<br />I guess I'll fuck a teenager."
3040357 3043147 It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br />no idea how shitty it was with Amy...
3043193 3045113 How fucking terrible she made me feel.
3045153 3048323 Flyover boy.<br />I would get knots in my stomach...
3048365 3050205 Just coming home,<br />knowing she would be sitting there...
3050242 3052403 Dissatisfied, before I even<br />walked in the fucking door.
3052410 3053830 This is so bad.
3053870 3055960 If anybody finds out,<br />you're totally fucked.
3055997 3058617 Boney found a pair of panties<br />in my office...
3058667 3060207 Where, occasionally, Andie and I...
3060669 3061789 I don't know what the fuck it means.
3061836 3062996 Are they super-twat's?
3063046 3065126 Her name is Andie.
3065173 3066673 She's not entirely sure.
3066716 3068376 So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...
3068426 3069836 Who isn't sure<br />where she leaves her undies?
3069886 3072136 If they're not Andie's,<br />that means that they're Amy's...
3072180 3073890 And she left them there for me to find.
3073932 3077692 Nick, I was scared for you before,<br />and now, I'm fucking petrified.
3077727 3080017 We're having a vigil tonight<br />for your missing wife...
3080063 3083193 And this morning, you're kissing<br />your college girlfriend goodbye!
3083233 3084403 Can you imagine?
3085026 3088356 Have you watched television lately?
3088405 3091415 Cable news is all over your shit.
3092033 3093873 I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?
3093910 3096200 His wife's nowhere to be found...
3096246 3099916 And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.<br />Cute pic, huh?
3099958 3102418 - Who is that?<br />- Some fucking tragedy groupie.
3102460 3104380 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- I don't know.
3104421 3105551 She was trying to give me a casserole.
3105589 3108719 On the show today<br />we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...
3108758 3111298 Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.
3111595 3115105 Tanner bolt, would you actually consider<br />defending Nick dunne?
3115140 3116270 Well, let me just say...
3116308 3119058 As always, Ellen,<br />thank you for such a warm welcome.
3119102 3120652 But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.
3120937 3123437 Listen, just because this guy<br />isn't walking around weeping...
3123481 3124901 That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.
3124941 3128281 Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath<br />is a lack of empathy.
3128320 3130280 But the truth is,<br />you'd have to be a sociopath...
3130780 3132570 To behave normally in this situation...
3132616 3135366 Because it's the most<br />abnormal situation in the world.
3135410 3138080 Tanner, are you trying to tell me<br />that this photo...
3138121 3140371 Is remotely in the realm<br />of acceptable behavior?
3140415 3143075 I'm so sick<br />of being picked apart by women.
3144461 3146341 You need to hire Tanner bolt.
3148233 3149233 I don't deserve this.
3149257 3151127 Innocent until proven guilty.
3151176 3153546 That's exactly what you deserve.
3153595 3155145 Go home, Nick.
3181122 3182542 Hey, buddy.
3198431 3200221 I can't believe<br />we haven't arrested this guy.
3200267 3202227 We're not gonna arrest anybody...
3202269 3203830 Just because some blonde dunce says so.
3204187 3206687 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3206982 3210322 One, I am conducting an investigation,<br />not a witch-hunt.
3210360 3212280 And, two,<br />don't talk to me that way, ever.
3212320 3213610 She was trying to buy a gun.
3213655 3215825 We don't know who<br />or what was scaring her, gil.
3215865 3216865 Give me the update.
3217367 3219987 No drug angles panned out yet,<br />so cross that off the list.
3220036 3221996 I talked to the nurses<br />who care for Nick's father.
3222038 3224748 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as<br />a kitten, so cross that off the list.
3224791 3225961 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3226001 3229421 So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br />like the 4th of July.
3229462 3230762 - Whoa.<br />- Yeah.
3230797 3231917 The blood is profuse.
3231965 3234185 It is Amy's, type b,<br />and we should have DNA soon.
3234217 3235297 Thoughts on a weapon?
3235343 3237263 Trajectory indicates blunt force.
3237304 3239644 Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
3240223 3243483 She fell there,<br />but I doubt she got back up.
3243518 3244938 Amy's medical records come in?
3244978 3246978 No, we'll have them later tonight.
3248565 3249985 My wife says he's a killer.
3250233 3252573 Well, if Tiffany says...
3278178 3279178 Hey.
3279512 3280512 Hey.
3284935 3286095 Thank you all for coming out.
3287771 3289401 Hey Donnie, how are you?
3289439 3292779 Rich, thank you so much.
3300075 3301085 Hey.
3308124 3311714 Thank you, folks.<br />Thank you for being here tonight.
3311753 3313553 It just means the world to our family.
3314089 3315549 And to Amy.
3316132 3318132 As you all know...
3318969 3322259 My wife, Amy elliott dunne...
3322305 3323805 Disappeared three days ago.
3324391 3327941 And I want to implore anyone<br />who has any information at all...
3327978 3330898 Please come forward. Help us.
3330939 3331859 So hot.
3331898 3333268 He is so creepy.
3333316 3336776 I wanna say something, because I think<br />some of you might be wondering...
3336820 3338740 And are too polite to ask.
3339239 3342329 I had nothing to do<br />with the disappearance of my wife.
3342909 3344869 I'm cooperating with the police.
3344911 3346951 I haven't hired a lawyer.
3346997 3348117 I have nothing to hide.
3349416 3351916 Amy is my soul mate.
3352168 3353458 She is brilliant...
3354004 3357094 She's charming, and wise.
3357424 3359134 I love you, Amy.
3363263 3364353 Asshole.
3365682 3367602 I love my wife...
3367976 3369186 So much.
3371688 3376028 And I may not behave for the cameras<br />the way they want me to...
3376443 3379653 And if they wanna punish me for that,<br />that's okay.
3379696 3383406 But I just wanna ask you in the media,<br />please, harass me...
3383450 3386490 But don't harass<br />the people of this town.
3386536 3388576 If you need to mock somebody, mock me.
3388622 3389832 Nick!
3389873 3392034 But please don't turn this investigation<br />into a circus.
3392042 3393632 Where's your wife, Nick?
3393668 3395168 Let the police do their jobs.
3395629 3397209 What did you do to your pregnant wife?
3399049 3400299 Did you tell them that, Nick?
3400342 3402392 Did you tell them<br />Amy was six weeks pregnant?
3406139 3408309 Thank you for your support tonight.<br />Let's find Amy.
3410477 3412117 Go ahead,<br />if you guys wanna say something.
3416191 3417571 Gil, go, go.
3419903 3421033 Nick, where are you going?
3421071 3422661 Stop him!
3422697 3424907 No questions right now. Thank you.
3427410 3428950 Why are you running away?
3430038 3431458 Don't run.
3432540 3433540 Everybody, stay back.
3438338 3440508 Guys, come on. You know better.
3440548 3443008 Get off the grass, get down to the curb.
3443051 3444471 - Hey, gil...<br />- On it.
3444511 3445551 All right.
3445595 3447385 All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.
3447430 3448720 Hello?
3449474 3451024 Hello?
3451059 3451889 Fuck.
3451935 3453445 You scared me. Want a drink?
3453478 3454978 Did you know she was pregnant?
3455021 3457151 I told you,<br />noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy.
3457190 3458230 She doesn't even know Amy.
3458900 3460501 They look like pretty good friends<br />to me.
3468076 3471496 Look, I don't know. But it certainly<br />doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
3471538 3472748 We have her medical records coming.
3472789 3474669 - Good.<br />- So, let's talk while we wait.
3474708 3476918 Let's start over here.<br />The scene of the crime.
3476960 3479840 You see, we've seen dozens<br />of home invasions.
3479879 3481839 Dozens and dozens.
3481881 3484091 This area right here, it looked wrong<br />from the second we saw it.
3484134 3487304 The whole thing looked staged.<br />Watch this.
3489222 3492642 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3493059 3494809 I don't know.<br />What do you want me to say?
3494853 3496483 Did you do any housekeeping<br />the day your wife went missing?
3496521 3497521 No.
3497522 3499772 Because our guys did a luminol test.
3499816 3502486 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3502527 3504777 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.<br />A lot.
3504821 3505821 Oh, my God.
3505822 3507162 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.
3507198 3509658 Wait a second.<br />Why would they mop up the blood...
3509701 3511302 If they're trying to stage<br />a crime scene?
3511328 3514078 No blood and no body<br />suggests kidnapping.
3514122 3516542 It tells us,<br />look at people outside the house.
3516583 3518003 Like these homeless you keep mentioning.
3518043 3521133 A pool of blood and no body<br />suggests homicide.
3521171 3523171 It tells us to look at people<br />inside the house.
3523214 3525934 - Which is what we're doing here, Nick.<br />- I see.
3525967 3528927 So, how was your marriage, Nick?<br />Because right now, all we got is noelle.
3528970 3530510 She says, "not good."
3530555 3532055 Gil, what do you and your wife<br />argue about?
3532098 3534228 - What pisses you off?<br />- Money, lack thereof.
3534267 3536017 Me and my ex, it's the same.
3536061 3539401 I mention that because<br />we got a look at your finances, Nick.
3539439 3542149 $117,000 in credit card debt.
3542192 3544152 - What?<br />- I pulled up some of the merchandise.
3544194 3546204 There are these fun little splurges.
3546238 3547778 I didn't buy any of this stuff.
3547822 3548952 I don't even golf!
3548990 3550320 I do! You bought great clubs.
3550367 3551657 I like the robot dog.
3551701 3553661 This is identity theft!<br />This is a felony!
3553703 3554663 We need to find out who did this!
3554704 3556464 All right.<br />Let's talk about life insurance.
3556498 3559038 Because in April,<br />you bumped up Amy's life insurance...
3559084 3560084 To $1.2 million.
3560126 3562496 Yes, I did. That was her idea.<br />She wanted me to.
3562545 3563705 You filed the paperwork.
3563755 3564955 Because she told me to!
3565734 3566734 Hold on a sec.
3566758 3568548 Yeah? Okay.
3570470 3571640 For sure?
3572055 3573225 All right.
3577310 3578310 She was pregnant.
3582399 3584029 This is insane.
3584067 3586567 So, my question becomes...
3586611 3589531 I don't want to talk<br />to you again, ever...
3589573 3590743 Without a lawyer.
3599082 3600082 Margo!
3610969 3611969 Hey.
3614347 3616767 Just hold on a second. Let me finish.
3616808 3617728 Nick?
3617767 3620557 I hear you, I hear you.<br />I was as surprised as...
3620604 3624444 I know you're upset.<br />I had no idea she was pregnant.
3624858 3627988 Listen, I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't...
3630488 3632618 you want to know the truth?
3632657 3635027 The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.
3637454 3639504 Well, I'm as surprised as...
3640832 3642632 you told me you didn't want kids.
3643627 3645027 I was trying to put a good face on.
3645045 3646925 Then, suddenly,<br />you've got a pregnant wife.
3646963 3648303 That's a problem for you.
3648340 3651430 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3651468 3652928 Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!
3652969 3654299 You have to fucking talk to me!
3656973 3661023 I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids<br />because she didn't want me to.
3661061 3663271 Because it would have just been<br />another reason for you to hate her.
3663313 3665193 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just...
3665231 3667441 - lie to me?<br />- I wanted kids!
3667484 3669654 When we first moved here,<br />I went to a fertility clinic!
3669694 3671364 - It didn't work?<br />- I did my part!
3671404 3672454 Masturbate.
3672489 3674199 When it came time for Amy to do her thing,<br />all of a sudden it was like...
3674241 3675781 "Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."
3675825 3677825 Now, who would believe you?
3678995 3680195 All right.
3689839 3691629 This is a letter from the clinic...
3691675 3694145 Notifying me<br />that they're gonna destroy my sample...
3694177 3696177 Unless I contact them.
3697430 3698970 So, I gave it to Amy.
3699015 3702015 The next day, I saw it in the trash.
3702060 3703640 But you were already with Andie<br />by then, right?
3703687 3706517 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3706564 3710744 A year ago, Amy being pregnant<br />would have been the best thing ever!
3717284 3719164 "When your poor Amy has a cold,<br />this dessert just..."
3719202 3720582 this is the clue you couldn't solve.
3720620 3721750 Yeah.
3723456 3726826 A letter from desi.<br />That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
3726876 3729246 It was the fucking rich guy<br />who would do anything for her.
3729296 3731256 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3731298 3732298 Your prenup?
3732632 3735592 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3735635 3737425 I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!
3740307 3743427 I love you no matter what.
3743476 3744846 But you need to tell me.
3744894 3746314 Tell you what?
3747147 3748767 What are you asking me?
3750358 3753528 Are you asking me<br />if I killed my wife, go?
3753987 3756067 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3756114 3758534 I would never ask you that!
3762495 3763495 Margo!
3776301 3778511 Don't walk on the glass.
3780221 3782851 You have no clue, do you?
3800659 3802239 Why was he here that night?
3803870 3806710 His wife is missing. Why come here?
3806748 3807748 Who cares?
3807958 3809208 Rhonda, we got this.
3809251 3810751 Let's make the arrest.
3810794 3812884 Do you know how hard it is<br />to make a murder case without a body?
3812921 3813841 No.
3813880 3816050 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3816091 3818971 So, I want one last thing.
3819010 3820010 What's that?
3821638 3823928 I want a body.
3825100 3829520 Picture me.<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.
3829562 3831192 Be careful.
3835735 3840155 I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished," I mean "had."
3844703 3845703 Fuck.
3847664 3850504 It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.
3851751 3853921 So, open the door...
3853962 3855342 Punish. Wood. Beach.
3855380 3857880 And look alive.
3861011 3863601 Punish. Wood.
3864764 3866354 Wood.
3898465 3901185 I will practice believing<br />my husband loves me...
3901217 3903637 And will love this baby.
3904304 3907934 That this child<br />might really save our marriage.
3908808 3910268 But I could be wrong.
3916441 3918361 Because sometimes...
3919361 3921571 The way he looks at me...
3922656 3924406 I think...
3924449 3925529 Man of my dreams...
3927452 3929542 Father of my child...
3930330 3934330 This man of mine may kill me.
3935710 3937710 He may truly...
3938630 3939630 Kill me.
3942342 3943342 Wtf?
3968285 3970875 I am so much happier now that I'm dead.
3975917 3977497 Technically, "missing."
3978336 3979996 Soon to be presumed dead.
3981715 3982845 Gone.
3983800 3987050 And my lazy, lying, cheating,<br />oblivious husband...
3987095 3990385 Will go to prison for my murder.
3991683 3994233 Nick dunne took my pride<br />and my dignity...
3994269 3996769 And my hope and my money.
3996813 4000403 He took and took from me<br />until I no longer existed.
4000442 4001862 That's murder.
4001902 4004702 Let the punishment fit the crime.
4005280 4008280 To fake a convincing murder,<br />you have to have discipline.
4012495 4015495 You befriend a local idiot.
4019044 4022214 Harvest the details<br />of her humdrum life.
4022589 4026179 And cram her with stories<br />about your husband's violent temper.
4027302 4029602 Secretly create some money troubles.
4029846 4033016 Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.
4035644 4037854 With the help of the unwitting...
4037896 4039896 Bump up your life insurance.
4041608 4044778 Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.
4044819 4048109 Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.
4048573 4053203 You need to package yourself so that<br />people will truly mourn your loss.
4053245 4056215 And America loves pregnant women.
4056539 4059539 As if it's so hard to spread your legs.
4059584 4060884 You know what's hard?
4061378 4063338 Faking a pregnancy.
4063380 4065550 First, drain your toilet.
4067259 4070009 Invite pregnant idiot into your home...
4070053 4072563 And ply her with lemonade.
4077727 4079897 Steal pregnant idiot's urine.
4082107 4083607 Voilà.
4083650 4087610 A pregnancy is now part<br />of your legal medical record.
4094119 4095449 Happy anniversary.
4098123 4100883 Wait for your clueless husband...
4100917 4102787 To start his day.
4104254 4105714 Off he goes.
4105755 4107915 And the clock is ticking.
4109092 4111592 Meticulously stage your crime scene...
4112262 4116272 With just enough mistakes<br />to raise the specter of doubt.
4117684 4119644 You need to bleed.
4119978 4120978 A lot.
4121605 4123275 A lot, a lot.
4126610 4128440 A head wound kind of bleed.
4129112 4131612 A crime scene kind of bleed.
4134618 4136738 You need to clean poorly...
4136786 4137786 Like he would.
4138496 4140996 Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.
4141625 4144215 And leave a little something behind.
4144878 4146628 A fire in July?
4148173 4149263 And because you're you...
4149299 4150549 You don't stop there.
4150967 4153177 You need a diary.
4153219 4156139 Minimum, 300 entries<br />on the Nick and Amy story.
4156806 4159096 Start with the fairy tale early days.
4159142 4161442 Those are true. And they're crucial.
4161478 4163478 You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.
4163813 4166443 After that, you invent.
4166483 4167483 The spending.
4167484 4169284 The abuse. The fear.
4169319 4172279 The threat of violence.
4172322 4174282 And Nick thought he was the writer.
4174991 4176281 Burn it just the right amount.
4178119 4179999 Make sure the cops will find it.
4185001 4188051 Finally, honor tradition<br />with a very special treasure hunt.
4190632 4193432 And if I get everything right,<br />the world will hate Nick...
4193468 4196178 For killing his beautiful,<br />pregnant wife.
4196221 4198851 And after all the outrage,<br />when I'm ready...
4198890 4200890 I'll go out on the water<br />with a handful of pills...
4200892 4203442 And a pocket full of stones.
4203478 4206268 And when they find my body,<br />they'll know...
4206314 4209614 Nick dunne dumped his beloved<br />like garbage.
4209651 4211991 And she floated down<br />past all the other...
4212028 4215358 Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.
4216741 4218701 Then, Nick will die, too.
4219578 4221448 Nick and Amy will be gone.
4221496 4223616 But, then, we never really existed.
4223665 4226885 Nick loved a girl<br />I was pretending to be.
4226918 4227918 "Cool girl."
4228378 4232218 Men always use that<br />as their defining compliment.
4232257 4233257 "She's a cool girl."
4234384 4235514 Cool girl is hot.
4235552 4236972 Cool girl is game.
4237012 4238012 Cool girl is fun.
4238346 4240846 Cool girl never gets angry at her man.
4240890 4243520 She only smiles in a chagrined,<br />loving manner...
4244185 4247145 And then presents her mouth for fucking.
4247188 4249188 She likes what he likes.
4249232 4252692 So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster<br />who loves fetish manga.
4253737 4257027 If he likes girls gone wild,<br />she's a mall babe...
4257073 4260873 Who talks football<br />and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.
4260911 4264501 When I met Nick dunne,<br />I knew he wanted cool girl.
4264539 4267209 And for him, I'll admit,<br />I was willing to try.
4267250 4269250 I wax-stripped my pussy raw.
4269920 4273050 I drank canned beer<br />watching Adam sandier movies.
4273298 4276088 I ate cold pizza<br />and remained a size two.
4276134 4278094 I blew him semi-regularly.
4279429 4280759 I lived in the moment.
4281056 4283596 I was fucking game.
4284225 4286265 I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.
4287103 4290403 Nick teased out of me<br />things I didn't know existed.
4290440 4293740 A lightness, a humor, an ease.
4293777 4296697 But I made him smarter. Sharper.
4296738 4300368 I inspired him to rise to my level.
4300408 4304158 I forged the man of my dreams.
4306498 4309418 We were happy pretending<br />to be other people.
4309459 4311289 We were the happiest couple we knew.
4312921 4315921 And what's the point of being together<br />if you're not the happiest?
4316591 4318801 But Nick got lazy.
4318843 4321053 He became someone<br />I did not agree to marry.
4321096 4324266 He actually expected me<br />to love him unconditionally.
4324933 4329443 Then he dragged me, penniless,<br />to the navel of this great country...
4329479 4333439 And found himself a newer,<br />younger, bouncier...
4333483 4334483 Cool girl.
4336820 4340990 You think I'd let him destroy me<br />and end up happier than ever?
4341491 4343161 No fucking way.
4343535 4345335 He doesn't get to win.
4355672 4359632 My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,<br />Missouri guy.
4362053 4364513 He needed to learn.
4365223 4367853 Grown-ups work for things.
4368393 4370353 Grown-ups pay.
4371730 4374320 Grown-ups suffer consequences.
4377819 4379029 Wait.
4379404 4382204 I need 20 seconds where you<br />don't judge me, interrupt me...
4382240 4383870 Or get angry.
4385327 4386867 Okay.
4390832 4392792 Is that all the stuff<br />from the credit cards?
4392834 4396004 Where do you store goodies<br />for anniversary five?
4396046 4396836 Wood.
4396880 4400010 - Woodshed.<br />- Yeah, my woodshed.
4400050 4402550 That fucking bitch.
4404387 4405717 - I thought...<br />- It's all right.
4405764 4407224 I would have, too.
4410685 4411885 What's that present?
4411937 4413687 I don't know.
4413730 4415690 Let's find out.
4422280 4426200 "Dear husband, I know you think<br />you're moving through this world unseen.
4426243 4427663 "Don't believe that for a second.
4427702 4429983 "I know where you've been,<br />and I know where you're going."
4433208 4435248 "For this anniversary,<br />I've arranged a trip.
4435293 4437173 "Follow the river, up, up, up.
4437212 4439922 "Sit back and relax,<br />because you are done."
4439965 4441385 What's "up, up river"?
4441424 4443594 "Up the river." Prison.
4443635 4445555 Fucking crazy bitch.
4445595 4447215 That's what this is.
4447264 4449564 She's framing me for her murder.
4449599 4450889 You married a complete psychopath.
4450934 4453064 The morning of our anniversary...
4453103 4457403 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4457440 4459900 I couldn't fake it for another year,<br />another day.
4459943 4460863 Then what happened?
4460902 4462202 Before I could say anything, she said...
4462237 4465617 "I need you to go somewhere<br />and really think about our marriage."
4465657 4466907 She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.
4466950 4468240 So you'd have no alibi.
4468285 4470505 She stage-managed me.
4470787 4474457 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4474499 4476039 I went to the beach,<br />I thought about our marriage.
4476084 4477794 I came back<br />and decided I wanted a divorce.
4477836 4479076 And by the time you got home...
4479087 4480627 she was gone.
4481149 4482149 You fuck!
4482173 4483763 She's good.
4484759 4486759 Part of me was relieved...
4486803 4489103 When I thought she was gone.
4493476 4495186 Punch and Judy puppets.
4498189 4501279 Remember, he beats Judy to death<br />and kills that baby.
4501318 4502438 So I'm punch.
4503445 4505455 We already knew that, Amy,<br />what's your point?
4506615 4509455 Does Missouri have the death penalty?
4536353 4537773 Hey, neighbor.
4538688 4541068 It's been weeks<br />since I had anyone decent next door.
4541691 4544321 Well, I don't know how decent I feel.
4544361 4547491 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast death metal at 4 am...
4547530 4549530 We're gonna be best friends.
4549574 4551664 All right. Nice meeting you.
4551701 4553291 I'm greta.
4553912 4555202 I'm Nancy.
4555247 4557207 Are you going to the marina?<br />I could use some creamer.
4557249 4558669 I'm sorry. I can't.
4558708 4559918 I've got work to do.
4560210 4562250 All right. See you around!
4562545 4564455 You will.
4610427 4615637 Come on.<br />Show me that darling Nicky smile.
4617434 4619314 You asshole.
4634784 4636294 Hey.
4639080 4640830 Nancy.
4643126 4644956 Nancy.
4645962 4648172 It's hot again today.
4650467 4652297 So, where are you from?
4652802 4653972 Let me guess.
4657098 4658098 Nebraska.
4660310 4661520 New Orleans.
4664981 4667481 You know, I am an expert oiler.
4667525 4669315 Oh, I just bet you are.
4669361 4671991 Lotions and balms. Ointment.
4672697 4674617 I would hate<br />for y'all to get tan lines.
4674658 4676658 So sweet.
4677494 4680164 Okay. You know where I'll be.
4683041 4685461 I see we have the same taste in men.
4687170 4689420 I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.
4689464 4692514 Least you could do<br />is not keep his secrets for him.
4693551 4694931 Let me guess.
4694970 4698850 He's trying to watch the big game<br />and you just won't shut up.
4699140 4701980 No, you don't seem<br />like much of a talker.
4702018 4703018 I got it.
4703019 4705479 You caught your boy rubbing up<br />on some hot little skank...
4705522 4707522 And he apologized to you<br />by busting you a good one.
4709901 4710901 Worse.
4711027 4712027 Worse?
4712862 4716572 I went to the bar where he works<br />to surprise him.
4716616 4721326 And out he comes with this girl<br />who had no business being in a bar.
4724291 4726291 On the very first night that we met...
4726543 4730713 We walked by a bakery<br />that was having their sugar delivered.
4731548 4733928 And it was in the air, everywhere.
4733967 4736257 A sugar storm.
4736303 4738433 And before he kissed me...
4738471 4740561 He leaned in...
4742058 4744348 And did this.
4755030 4757490 - And guess what.<br />- What?
4757532 4759242 He did the exact same thing with her.
4763496 4766496 That is the most disgusting thing<br />I ever heard.
4766541 4768251 Thank you.
4783016 4784596 Thanks very much.
4791399 4793689 Well, we've gone mainstream.
4809292 4812422 It's an appeals process,<br />so we will attempt to appeal to them.
4812462 4814592 Mr. bolt. Tanner bolt?
4816466 4817876 Nick dunne.
4817926 4820216 I have been sitting by the phone,<br />my friend.
4823682 4824932 I'm sorry.
4824975 4826815 Do you not believe me?
4826851 4830101 No, I believe you. It's just the<br />craziest thing I've ever heard.
4830146 4833476 I love it. But, for you, it sucks.
4834192 4837492 But you gotta have a grudging respect<br />for your wife at this point, right?
4837529 4839109 - Are you laughing me out of the building?<br />- No!
4839155 4840905 Are you kidding me? I'm in.
4840949 4842409 I'm way in.
4842450 4845080 You came to the right guy.<br />This is what I do, Nick.
4845120 4848540 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.<br />I win the unwinnable cases.
4848582 4850252 $100,000?
4850292 4851832 We'll figure something out.
4851876 4852916 I'll give you a special...
4852919 4855839 "My wife is skilled<br />in the art of vengeance" rate.
4855880 4856920 Okay.
4856965 4858595 So, what's the plan?
4858633 4860513 Well, right now,<br />it's a "he said, she said."
4860552 4863012 - She's telling a better story.<br />- No, Nick.
4863054 4864894 She is telling the perfect story.
4865181 4868481 So, we need to start today<br />to prepare your defense, should we need it.
4868518 4870918 - And if we decide to go with<br />your version of... - the truth.
4871813 4875153 Then we'll need to realign<br />the public's perception of Amy.
4875191 4877441 Make them stop seeing her<br />as America's sweetheart...
4877485 4880815 And see her for what she is,<br />which a mind-fucker of the first degree.
4881239 4885199 Now, that is a huge realignment.<br />We'll need other voices besides yours.
4885243 4887503 There has to be someone out there<br />that she's screwed with in the past.
4887537 4890617 There's a New York guy.<br />O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
4890665 4893035 Eight years ago,<br />she pressed charges against him.
4893084 4895254 That should be easy to find.
4895795 4899165 Ex-classmate, desi collings.
4899215 4901095 She said that he stalked her.<br />He's in St. Louis.
4902385 4904635 You go talk to Tommy,<br />and I'll draw up the contract.
4908934 4911944 I told you, you came to the right guy.
4914147 4915357 Apparently.
4924407 4926197 Tommy?
4926243 4927793 Yeah.
4928203 4930163 - Thanks for seeing me.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4933250 4934960 You're gonna want a drink.
4935502 4936842 Yeah.
4936878 4939668 So, she said you got physical with her.
4939714 4942684 No, dude, she said I raped her.
4942717 4945087 First degree, felony rape.
4945845 4947555 - Did you do it?<br />- Did you do it?
4948723 4950813 I was looking at 30 years to life.
4951351 4952891 - Did you get a trial?<br />- Fuck, no.
4952936 4955146 Do I look like<br />I would do well in the yard?
4955188 4958108 I pled down, man.<br />Sexual assault one, no jail time.
4958525 4960195 - That's something.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4960235 4961655 I've been unemployed<br />for the last eight years...
4961695 4964205 Because I have to write "sexual offender"<br />on every job application.
4964239 4967199 I'm on a neighborhood watch list,<br />because I have to register as a predator.
4967242 4970582 I haven't had a date in almost a decade,<br />because if a girl googles me...
4972539 4974459 Could you walk me through what happened?
4974749 4977879 I meet Amy at this party, you know?
4977919 4979549 We click. She's perfect.
4979588 4981918 She's beautiful,<br />she's smart, she's well-read...
4981965 4984265 She's got an ass<br />like a 20-year-old stripper.
4984301 4986091 I think, "what's the catch?"
4986136 4989306 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4989973 4993023 Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?
4993059 4996519 She annexed me.<br />She made me her business.
4996563 5000363 It was just too much.<br />She went out and bought me ties.
5000400 5002610 And we must have gone<br />20 rounds over that.
5002652 5005412 Ties. The whole thing just became...
5005447 5009237 - so, you broke up with her.<br />- No, I just backed away.
5009284 5012084 Gave her some space. No big deal, right?
5012120 5013790 So I thought.
5013830 5016120 Then one night,<br />Amy comes over to my place...
5016166 5019086 With a bottle of bourbon<br />and a bootleg of this band I love.
5019127 5022127 And within two minutes,<br />she's got my pants around my ankles...
5022172 5023762 And she is kneeling down, and...
5023798 5025798 I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.
5025842 5027722 - You had sex?<br />- Yeah, consensual.
5027761 5029851 It was rough,<br />but she was screaming for it.
5030305 5032645 Next morning,<br />there's two cops at my door.
5032974 5035894 Amy has wounds<br />that are consistent with rape.
5035936 5039106 Ligature marks on her wrist,<br />and my semen.
5039147 5042817 It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,<br />and raped her.
5042859 5044319 Me!
5044361 5046111 And then, guess what they find.
5046154 5048204 Headboards of my bed, one on each side.
5048615 5049955 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5049991 5051331 You do know your wife.
5051993 5053833 - Did you ever see her again?<br />- Yeah.
5053870 5055290 On TV, last week, with you.
5055872 5057292 I thought, "there's Amy.
5057332 5061342 "She's graduated from being raped<br />to being murdered."
5065173 5066343 You been watching this, too?
5066383 5067593 Last night's bombshell.
5067634 5068684 We just found out...
5068718 5071548 Amy elliott dunne was, indeed,<br />pregnant when she went missing.
5072055 5075025 Kelly capitono,<br />this makes me wanna throw up.
5075058 5078018 What is it about a pregnant woman,<br />a woman carrying life inside her...
5078061 5079521 That turns men into animals?
5079562 5081062 Ellen, this is an epidemic.
5081356 5083606 The third leading cause of death<br />among pregnant women...
5083650 5086030 Is homicide committed by<br />a boyfriend or husband.
5086069 5088949 Let's not forget about the wife, ever.
5088989 5093029 Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,<br />noelle hawthorne.
5093076 5095446 Thanks for being on the show, noelle.
5095495 5096785 Thank you, Ellen.
5096830 5098330 And let me just say this...
5098373 5101963 Amy would have loved you,<br />and all you do for women.
5102002 5103042 Oh, that's nice.
5103086 5105206 Why don't you tell us<br />about your friend, noelle?
5105255 5107805 Amy was so nurturing.
5107841 5110221 Oh, I'd love if just once,<br />someone was like...
5110260 5111550 "She was a real rag."
5114055 5116635 She was beautiful and smart and kind.
5116683 5118733 Seems like a rich bitch to me.
5118768 5121398 What do you mean? People love her.
5121438 5123858 I don't know. She seems uppity.
5125567 5128067 Spoiled rich girl,<br />married a cheating asshole.
5128111 5129321 Paid the ultimate price.
5129362 5132822 The only secret was her husband.<br />We never met Nick.
5132866 5134486 He never introduced himself.
5134534 5136914 Why was that, noelle? Why do you think?
5136953 5137953 I think we know why.
5138747 5140997 Because he had a violent temper.
5141041 5142081 A little harsh.
5142125 5143705 That's life, baby.
5143752 5145313 He knew I'd have<br />seen right through him.
5146254 5147594 Don't get me wrong.
5147631 5149511 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
5149549 5152969 I'm just saying, there are consequences.
5155096 5156096 Fuck, yeah.
5156139 5158559 She was so alone.
5158600 5160520 And she was so innocent.
5160560 5164020 You're a good friend, noelle.<br />And you're a good friend of the show.
5164064 5165274 Thanks for coming on.
5165315 5166775 Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt.
5166816 5169106 Tanner bolt landed me.
5169152 5172452 I'm gonna try and see desi collings<br />on my way home.
5172489 5174449 And, go...
5174491 5177661 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5178119 5179579 That's just the retainer.
5179955 5183585 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an ira.
5183625 5185728 I'm approved for a second<br />mortgage on the house.
5185754 5186715 We will go from there.
5186753 5188503 Thank you.
5189256 5190916 - I love you.<br />- I love you, too.
5190966 5193716 Nick keeps his father,<br />who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.
5193760 5195970 Number of times he visited last year?<br />One.
5196012 5197012 Oh, fuck!
5197013 5199723 His twin sister, margo,<br />well, she is a peach.
5199766 5202096 These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.
5202686 5204806 Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?
5204854 5205984 What the fuck?
5206022 5208692 Twin siblings often enable and abet.
5209192 5211032 While I never examined Nick,<br />or his sister...
5211820 5213950 They both seem very, very close.
5214281 5215531 It's twin-cest.
5215865 5218575 Disturbingly close, Lauren.
5218618 5220618 And so, we close with a question.
5220662 5222162 What kind of moral rot...
5222205 5226915 Allows a beautiful, talented,<br />kind, smart, loving mother...
5226960 5230670 To vanish without<br />the heavens hearing our outraged cries?
5230714 5231764 Can I bum a cigarette?
5231798 5235548 Amy elliott dunne, we care about you,<br />and we will not forget.
5236052 5238262 And you know what else we won't forget?
5238305 5240685 Missouri has the death penalty.
5240724 5241894 Amen.
5267751 5270041 I'd like to report<br />some strange activity...
5270086 5273586 Near the woodshed<br />on the property of one margo dunne.
5314798 5316258 Hey.
5321805 5323935 - Mr. dunne.<br />- Mr. collings.
5324933 5328023 I know you.<br />I saw you at the volunteer center.
5328061 5329771 I wanted to help.
5330563 5332273 I hope you don't mind me coming by.
5332315 5335395 I got your address from this letter<br />that you wrote my wife.
5336278 5339778 Amy and I believe<br />in the lost art of letter-writing.
5339823 5343663 I always wondered<br />why you kept in touch after...
5344327 5345617 Everything.
5345662 5348082 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5348123 5350293 She was my first serious girlfriend.
5350333 5353133 - Why did you break up?<br />- That's a strange question.
5353169 5355129 Did you treat her bad?<br />Did you cheat on her?
5355171 5356381 That's a rude question.
5356423 5358133 Let me tell you what Amy told me.
5358174 5361144 She dumped you,<br />you completely unraveled.
5361177 5363257 You stalked her, you threatened her...
5363305 5366815 And you attempted suicide in her bed<br />and were institutionalized.
5366850 5370770 Your wife is missing,<br />and you came all this way to tell me this?
5370812 5373022 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5376693 5378533 Mr. collings.
5380614 5382534 Fuck.
5388163 5391173 The missing persons case<br />of Amy elliott dunne.
5391207 5394877 She is the beautiful blonde inspiration<br />for the amazing Amy kids' book series.
5412062 5414272 You're reading that diary again?
5414314 5415364 You know how it ends.
5415398 5417858 It interests me.
5417901 5419491 Hey, Rhonda.
5419527 5421447 "He's gonna kill me." The end.
5421488 5423608 Why did he go to his dad's house<br />to burn it?
5423657 5424777 It's private. There's no one there.
5424824 5427624 Why didn't he make sure<br />it actually burned?
5427661 5430621 Because he tripped the alarm.<br />You were up his ass with a flashlight.
5430664 5433004 The whole thing just feels hinky.
5433041 5435131 Like finding an envelope marked "clue."
5435168 5436288 You ever hear the expression...
5436336 5438177 "The simplest answer<br />is often the correct one"?
5438880 5440880 Actually, I've never<br />found that to be true.
5440924 5442724 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
5445387 5446387 Hey.
5455855 5457725 Elvis is in Missouri.
5457774 5459904 Thank God. Come on in.
5459943 5462823 First thing you have to understand<br />about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.
5462946 5465406 - Play God.<br />- Yeah, old testament God.
5465448 5466488 Okay. Keep talking.
5466533 5468243 She finds out I've been cheating on her<br />with Andie...
5468285 5469875 Decides to teach me a lesson.
5469911 5471831 Fakes her own death, frames me for it.
5471871 5474081 Blood in the house, credit cards,<br />life insurance.
5474124 5475334 She does the treasure hunt.
5475375 5476715 Now, the treasure hunt is critical.
5476751 5479198 She's taking us on a<br />tour of my infidelities.
5479224 5480421 Rubbing my nose in it.
5480463 5482513 And she leaves clue number one<br />for the police...
5482549 5484259 Which will lead them<br />back to my office...
5484301 5486841 Which is a place<br />where Andie and I would often...
5486886 5488216 And she leaves a pair of red panties.
5488263 5489433 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5489472 5491182 - Clue two.<br />- My father's house.
5491224 5493604 Another place where Andie and I<br />would occasionally have relations.
5493643 5495023 - Clue three?<br />- Woodshed.
5495061 5496561 - Also a location...<br />- Oh, my God.
5496605 5498365 - We had limited options.<br />- A hotel.
5498398 5500898 - Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br />- Put it on Andie's credit card.
5500942 5502282 Andie's statement<br />went right to her parents.
5502319 5504859 Nick, margo, can we head over<br />to the little brown house?
5504905 5506705 - This leads us to what?<br />- My dad's house.
5506740 5508490 Dad's house is blue.
5509784 5512834 After the divorce,<br />when dad wasn't coming around...
5513163 5517423 I used to pretend that he was a spy<br />named Mr. brown, who...
5517459 5521129 For the sake of his children's safety,<br />had to deny their existence.
5521171 5522591 You never told me that.
5522839 5524629 You told her that?
5524674 5526974 We've got incriminating red panties<br />in your office.
5527302 5529702 We've got a showcase showdown<br />worth of crap in your woodshed.
5530805 5534135 So, what in God's name<br />is at your father's house, Nick?
5534184 5535274 And be honest.
5535310 5537150 I honestly have no idea.
5544319 5548029 Whatever they found, I think it's<br />safe to assume that it's very bad.
5549866 5552116 We got a lot of uncontained issues here.
5552369 5555459 Nick, do you have any idea<br />as to what Andie's mindset is?
5556665 5558465 We haven't communicated since the vigil.
5558500 5559830 Okay. Amy's parents?
5559876 5561456 - No, it's...<br />- More pressure.
5561503 5564763 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will<br />no doubt go public at any moment.
5564798 5566298 - No, Andie won't do that.<br />- She will.
5566341 5568051 They always do.<br />Don't take it personally.
5568551 5570721 Amy's got us in an interesting bind.
5571054 5573354 - We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br />- Really?
5573390 5575560 Right now,<br />Andie just gives you another motive.
5576393 5577563 We need to tell the cops<br />about the woodshed.
5577852 5579272 We need to be on the front end of that.
5579312 5581652 But I'm gonna warn you<br />as to what will happen.
5582232 5583442 They'll go after margo.
5583483 5584483 They can't do that, can they?
5584526 5586436 She's your accomplice.<br />She helped you hide the evidence.
5586486 5588566 In all likelihood,<br />she knows that you killed Amy.
5589489 5590909 God.
5591241 5593331 Well, what are we going to do?
5593368 5594368 We find Amy.
5594661 5597001 No. Any other strategy<br />is missing the point.
5597038 5599368 I've got two ex-secret service guys<br />that are really good.
5599416 5601036 I'll put them on it.
5601084 5602504 But where do they start, Nick?
5602877 5603997 Where would Amy go?
5606172 5607802 I have no idea.
5612262 5614892 Are we keeping score?
5615557 5616927 Hey!
5618560 5621730 I thought we were steering clear<br />of men for a while.
5621771 5622771 He's nice.
5622772 5625272 Because he wants to fuck you.
5626902 5628442 She's still moping about her ex?
5630238 5632908 He got cheated on, too.
5636286 5639156 We three are the<br />saddest sacks in all the ozarks.
5639205 5640745 I'm not sad.
5641291 5642291 I'm angry.
5642292 5644092 There you go.
5644127 5646747 I almost drank myself to death<br />when my wife left me.
5646796 5649046 I was gonna kill myself.<br />Can you believe that?
5649090 5650220 Don't give him the pleasure.
5650258 5653388 I was going to drown myself<br />in the Gulf of Mexico...
5653428 5655928 Let myself be dinner<br />for the great whites.
5655972 5657772 Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.
5657807 5661727 Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.
5661770 5664230 Please put that on a t-shirt.
5672781 5675161 Miss moneybags.<br />I thought you said you were broke.
5676660 5677950 That's a fat wad.
5679746 5681536 It's mostly singles.
5681581 5683461 Singles? What are you, a stripper?
5684251 5686841 Swamp girls, or treasure chest?
5687963 5689013 We're just teasing.
5689798 5691588 Don't they tease people down in nola?
5694010 5696970 We can expect Nick dunne's arrest<br />any day now.
5697013 5700733 We've got blood in the house,<br />huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.
5700767 5704727 And we have Amy elliott dunne,<br />missing for five days...
5704771 5706901 Crying out for justice.
5707691 5709401 We'll be right back.
5761661 5764251 Tanner has a very bad idea<br />he's going to pitch you.
5764289 5765079 Yeah?
5765123 5766713 You're doing Sharon schieber<br />tomorrow in St. Louis.
5766750 5767750 It could go so wrong.
5767792 5769542 And you are going<br />to tell her about Andie.
5769586 5770876 Nope.
5770921 5772921 That sounds like a very bad idea.
5772964 5775054 You haven't heard from her<br />in three days.
5775091 5778801 This is a ticking time bomb.<br />You've gotta throw yourself on it.
5778845 5781385 - People are gonna hate me.<br />- And then, they will forgive you.
5781431 5783891 A guy admitting that he's a<br />gigantic asshole on television?
5783934 5785604 People empathize with that.
5787020 5788940 - Why don't we just put out a statement?<br />- They need to see you.
5788980 5792070 Sharon's specials,<br />they get 10 million viewers.
5792108 5794608 She is a crusader.<br />If she takes you on as a cause...
5794653 5796573 she's going to ask real questions.
5796613 5798453 I will drill you<br />as if you were doing a deposition.
5798490 5799950 What to say, what not to say.
5799991 5801121 A trained monkey?
5801159 5803279 A trained monkey<br />who doesn't get the lethal injection.
5804537 5807997 Nick, this case<br />is about what people think of you.
5808041 5809791 They need to like you.
5809834 5813674 Now, you do this and you will reach<br />millions of those people.
5814839 5817339 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5826620 5827620 Hello?
5827644 5828854 Hey, baby.
5830313 5831903 One minute.
5840657 5842117 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
5842158 5843158 You clearing out?
5843159 5844989 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5845036 5846616 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5846663 5847713 I'll come by before...
5847747 5849497 let us give you a hand.
5855672 5858132 Yeah, you gotta<br />clear everything out, here.
5859801 5862511 Dorothy is a real stickler.
5863847 5867137 Not even a spare hanger<br />can you leave behind.
5869728 5871329 Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.
5873815 5874815 A sock...
5875734 5878534 Or undies or what have you.
5883366 5884696 You did a real good job.
5886703 5888833 Where is the money, sweetheart?
5892500 5893500 Look under her dress.
5895045 5896305 He talked you into this?
5896338 5897668 I talked him into it.
5897714 5899724 The second you leave,<br />I'm calling the cops.
5900216 5903886 Your glasses are fake.<br />Your hair's dyed all hamster.
5903929 5907009 You say your name's Nancy, but you<br />don't even answer to it half the time.
5907057 5909517 You're hiding. I don't know why,<br />and I don't really care.
5909559 5911599 But you ain't gonna call the cops.
5911937 5914017 And I don't think you've<br />ever really been hit before.
5920237 5922237 Holy shit.
5925283 5928083 Sorry, but we really need the money.
5928119 5929749 Next place, be more careful, okay?
5929788 5932148 There are a lot of people out there<br />a lot worse than we are.
5966741 5968371 Excuse me. You can't sleep here.
5995979 5999069 I did not kill my wife.
6000066 6003356 Why don't you try it again?<br />A little less wooden.
6003403 6004493 I didn't kill my wife.
6006323 6008033 - What are you doing?<br />- Every time you look smug...
6008074 6010744 Or annoyed or tense,<br />I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.
6010785 6012745 - That's supposed to make me less tense?<br />- Let's try it again.
6012787 6016077 Mr. dunne, from what I understand,<br />you and your wife had some bumps.
6017125 6021085 Yeah, we had some tough years.<br />I lost my job.
6021129 6022129 You both did.
6024841 6026721 We both lost our jobs.
6026760 6029300 I had to move back home<br />so we could take care of my mother...
6029346 6031886 Who was dying of cancer<br />and my dad, who had...
6031932 6033682 your dad's scorched earth.
6033725 6035395 Let's talk about your mom,<br />how close you were.
6035435 6036595 Go on.
6036645 6039155 For a while,<br />things had been building up.
6039189 6042689 "Built up" implies that an explosion<br />is coming. No.
6042734 6045154 At a certain point,<br />we got on the wrong track.
6045987 6047607 I had a moment of weakness.
6047656 6050066 Your "moment" was over 15 months.
6053870 6055960 I disrespected my wife.
6056623 6059043 And I disrespected my marriage.
6059501 6060881 And I'll always regret it.
6061480 6062480 That works.
6062504 6064924 Don't be afraid to play up<br />the dufus husband thing, Nick.
6064965 6066675 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.
6066716 6067546 "Everything I do is wrong."
6067592 6069642 I know.<br />What men are supposed to do in general.
6071763 6072813 - Thank you.<br />- How do you feel?
6072847 6076057 I feel good.<br />Go, can you pass me that box, please?
6076476 6079096 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present<br />to me.
6079145 6080145 You hate that watch.
6080188 6082268 No, go. I love that watch.
6082315 6084315 Just like I love this tie.
6084359 6087489 Just like I love my wife.
6117851 6119231 It's you!
6119269 6121269 It's you.
6122105 6124105 I'm sorry.
6124774 6126114 I'm sorry.
6127027 6129027 Good God.
6129070 6130450 Last week...
6130947 6136117 I threatened to leave, and he said<br />he'd find me and he'd kill me.
6136453 6138623 So, I disappeared.
6139789 6141619 I lost the baby.
6142125 6143915 I couldn't even tell my parents.
6143960 6147880 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.
6148632 6149802 Well, he is looking for you.
6150467 6152427 He showed up on my doorstep<br />three days ago.
6152469 6154969 He tracked me from my letters to you.
6156097 6157307 You saved them.
6157891 6158931 Knowing you were out there...
6158975 6161595 Was the only thing that's kept me going<br />these past few years.
6161645 6163025 Let's go to the police.<br />You can explain everything.
6163063 6164363 No, I can't turn up now.
6164397 6167477 I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.
6169319 6171609 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?
6171655 6173495 He should go to prison<br />for what he's done.
6176326 6178786 I'm setting you up at my lake house.
6178828 6179828 It's utterly secluded.
6181248 6183078 Why are you so good to me?
6183124 6184464 You know why.
6184501 6185631 Excuse me.
6185669 6186789 I know you, don't I?
6186836 6187626 No.
6187671 6189631 You're one of the nolan girls, right?
6189673 6192553 No, we're from winnipeg. Excuse us.
6192592 6193472 We should leave.
6193510 6194590 Just a second.
6195178 6198428 That was boney. I'll call her later.
6198473 6200353 Tanner. Nice to see you.
6200642 6201772 Sharon! Hi.
6201810 6203480 Hope this is worth my while.
6203520 6204650 You're gonna be very happy.
6204915 6205915 Sharon.
6205939 6208149 Ms. schieber.<br />Thank you so much for doing this.
6208191 6210321 Can I get you anything to drink or eat<br />before we get started?
6210360 6212360 No, I had some gummy bears.
6213446 6215026 What the fuck?
6216199 6217329 I'm sorry?
6217742 6221622 We have a major shocking development<br />in the amazing Amy disappearance.
6221663 6223043 We go live to that story now.
6223081 6224371 Oh, my God.
6226543 6228343 You little slut.
6228378 6231378 My name is Andie Fitzgerald.
6232382 6234052 I met Nicholas dunne...
6234092 6237722 When he was my creative writing teacher<br />at mill valley.
6237762 6239852 Why is she dressed like a babysitter?
6239889 6241349 I am deeply ashamed...
6241391 6244521 Of having been romantically involved<br />with a married man.
6244561 6246481 The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.
6246521 6248521 I truly believed we were in love.
6248565 6250405 Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.
6251902 6253362 I know that is no excuse.
6253403 6254703 No, it is not.
6254738 6259078 I do not, in my heart, believe<br />Nick dunne would have killed for me.
6259117 6261537 My prayers go out to everyone<br />who loves Amy.
6261578 6264578 I apologize for the pain<br />this has caused them.
6269794 6271754 We have loved Nick dunne like a son.
6272589 6273969 That love ended today.
6274257 6275877 Come on, you're staring at ghosts.
6275926 6278586 He met our trust with lie after lie.
6278929 6280849 We now absolutely believe...
6280889 6283269 Nick is involved in the disappearance<br />of our daughter.
6283308 6285558 Our amazing Amy.
6286436 6288556 This just got very exciting.
6289272 6290982 We need a moment.
6292984 6294744 We're gonna have to bow out of this.
6294778 6296579 - Nothing has changed.<br />- Everything has changed.
6296613 6299033 An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?
6299074 6300714 - I can handle this.<br />- We're on the defense.
6300742 6302792 This is a completely different dynamic.
6302827 6305577 - I can handle it.<br />- She's going to eat you alive.
6306122 6307792 Just trust me.
6312170 6313550 Okay.
6313588 6314668 Great.
6315507 6316967 Mic him.
6336695 6338495 One, two, three, four, five.
6344828 6345828 Thank you.
6346997 6348287 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.
6348331 6349331 Yeah, no kidding.
6354004 6357134 Roll tape. Five... four...
6357173 6358803 Three... two...
6361011 6363931 Seriously, I can't believe<br />how fucking good you were.
6363972 6365432 - Amy brings out the best in me.<br />- Don't.
6365473 6368643 Keep it together, you two.<br />At least for the next 24 hours.
6368685 6371105 People still hate you.<br />Women want to scratch your eyes out.
6371146 6373016 Andie was really good TV.
6373064 6375114 - She's a good person.<br />- Therein lies the problem.
6375150 6376150 Ride this out...
6376192 6379202 And when Sharon airs tomorrow,<br />we'll be looking at a whole new you.
6379237 6380817 But, until then...
6380864 6382824 Don't show your face.
6382866 6384696 No problem.
6401009 6402389 Welcome.
6404387 6406217 Make yourself at home.
6406264 6410234 I've got music, satellite...
6410268 6411268 Netflix.
6411269 6412349 He was her teacher!
6412395 6413395 Roku.
6413939 6416439 Internet, obviously.
6417025 6419745 Here is a supposedly grown man...
6419778 6423568 if there is ever anything you have<br />a taste for and you can't find it...
6423615 6425875 Just let me know<br />and I will get it for you.
6425909 6429039 Instead of the a-b-c's,<br />he taught her the birds and the bees.
6429079 6431999 And just think how her mother must feel<br />at a time like this.
6432040 6434040 Wine cellar's downstairs.
6437504 6438884 I'll get you some clothes, too.
6438922 6442342 Not that I don't appreciate<br />bait shop chic.
6443510 6446010 The floors are heated,<br />just dial to your liking.
6446054 6449224 There's robes and towels.<br />The shower has steam.
6449266 6451596 The bathtub has a massage cycle.
6453436 6455476 There's a great view,<br />if you're in the mood.
6455522 6457062 Blackout curtains if you're not.
6457107 6459567 The bed is savoir.
6459609 6461859 You'll never get a better sleep.
6465740 6468080 This is just what I need.
6469536 6471446 I'm so exhausted.
6472956 6475116 I'll leave you to it, then.
6476876 6479626 Amy, I am so happy that you are here.
6480630 6483760 And I don't want you to worry<br />for one moment.
6483800 6485760 There are cameras everywhere.
6485802 6488682 The exterior, all along the grounds,<br />the entryway.
6488722 6489722 Anyone...
6489889 6492139 Who is caught coming or going...
6495395 6496985 Will be recorded.
6498565 6501285 You are more than safe.
6503236 6506736 And I am not letting you get away again.
6552494 6554084 - Good morning!<br />- Don't do that!
6555830 6556960 I'm sorry.
6558959 6560459 I need to feel safe.
6560794 6563804 You are very safe.
6566007 6567627 - What have you been up to?<br />- Nothing.
6567676 6570386 Amy, I'm not Nick.
6570428 6572428 It's hard for me.
6575350 6578980 After so many years<br />under someone's thumb...
6581231 6582552 I know just what that feels like.
6583441 6585441 You were never under my thumb.
6586027 6588067 - On your leash.<br />- Never.
6588113 6589613 A new start.
6590907 6592527 Decent clothes.
6593451 6595701 Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.
6595996 6597496 There's a gym overlooking the lake.
6597872 6601422 The sooner you look like yourself,<br />the sooner you'll feel like yourself.
6601459 6604589 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br />Sharon schieber, and finally move on.
6604629 6607169 I think that's something<br />I should watch on my own.
6607591 6609301 Nonsense.
6612929 6614349 I'll be back.
6615974 6618144 And I am looking forward...
6618184 6621104 To my reunion with Amy elliott.
6644294 6645464 Great.
6646504 6648594 Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.
6648632 6650262 - Tonight, exclusively...<br />- Hurry up.
6651176 6655556 A husband breaks his silence,<br />not just on his wife's disappearance...
6655597 6659387 But on his infidelity,<br />and all those shocking rumors.
6661853 6663403 Nick dunne...
6663438 6666938 You're probably the most hated man<br />in America right now.
6666983 6669573 I probably am.<br />And I probably deserve it.
6669611 6671201 I bought that tie.
6671238 6673278 Did you kill your wife, Nick?
6673323 6676413 I did not kill my wife.
6677077 6678617 I am not a murderer.
6678662 6680582 But you were unfaithful.
6680622 6682832 I was unfaithful.
6682874 6684544 And I am deeply ashamed.
6684584 6686924 And, on top of that,<br />you allowed Amy's parents...
6687212 6689962 Her friends,<br />all the people in your hometown...
6690006 6694926 Believe you were a loving husband,<br />desperate to find his missing wife.
6694970 6696850 Well, I am desperate<br />to find my missing wife.
6696888 6699888 You say that, but I'm wondering<br />how you expect us to believe you...
6699933 6701643 Now that we know you're a liar.
6701935 6705065 I didn't come forward with my affair...
6705105 6708275 Because I knew it would make me look<br />really, really bad.
6709109 6710899 But I don't care about that anymore.
6710944 6712574 I just want to find my wife.
6712612 6715162 - I'm just trying to get clear...<br />- Let me be clear.
6715198 6719618 Just because I am not a murderer<br />doesn't make me a good guy.
6719661 6720831 I'm not a good guy.
6721246 6723706 I was a bad husband to a great wife.
6724082 6725832 I broke the vow that I made to her.
6726084 6728634 Those are pretty words, Nick.
6728962 6730712 But what does that really mean to you?
6730755 6732795 It basically means<br />that I was a con artist.
6733758 6736968 I met Amy elliott seven years ago.
6737012 6738602 I was completely transfixed.
6739055 6740965 Amy can do that to you.
6741016 6743556 I was this average guy<br />from an average place...
6743602 6745602 With mediocre aspirations.
6745645 6748145 And I met a woman who dazzled me.
6748189 6750149 And I wanted her to love me...
6750191 6752531 So I pretended to be better than I was.
6753403 6757073 When we got married,<br />I promised to be that guy.
6757115 6758945 That guy who works harder.
6758992 6761202 That guy who, who lives and acts...
6761244 6764164 And loves with as much passion<br />as she does.
6764414 6765624 But I failed her.
6766541 6767902 Instead of doing what was right...
6769169 6770339 I did what was easy.
6771087 6774717 You talk like a man who believes<br />he can make amends to his wife.
6774758 6776378 Who believes his wife is still alive.
6776426 6777716 She is still alive.
6779596 6782426 Will you look at that camera for me?
6782766 6785726 Will you look in the lens...
6785769 6787729 And talk to your wife?
6787771 6790861 If she is out there,<br />able to hear and see you tonight...
6790899 6793569 What would you like to say to her, Nick?
6797113 6799413 Amy, I love you.
6800116 6802906 You're the best person I've ever known.
6802953 6807423 And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br />for the way that I've treated you.
6807457 6809417 And if you come back, I promise...
6809459 6811959 I will spend every day<br />making it up to you.
6812462 6816302 I will be the man<br />that I promised you I would be.
6818885 6819885 I love you.
6820804 6822394 Come home.
6827143 6828143 Here.
6834276 6835896 Regardless of what you thought...
6835944 6838114 What does it say?
6838154 6839704 I think we can all agree...
6839739 6841239 Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.
6841283 6842453 There's more to him<br />than meets the eye.
6842492 6843613 They're going crazy for you.
6843618 6848118 They disliked me, they liked me,<br />they hated me.
6848164 6849794 And now they love me.
6849833 6852793 A candor and an honesty<br />that's worthy of respect.
6852836 6854746 He's certainly earned mine.
6855589 6856669 What is it?
6859509 6862679 I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.
6867601 6870391 Margo dunne, this is a search warrant<br />for your property.
6870437 6872647 I usually ignore tipline calls...
6872689 6877279 But a neighbor was concerned about<br />a strange man around your woodshed.
6877694 6878694 Call Tanner.
6878695 6879865 Okay. Fuck!
6883992 6885452 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.
6886703 6887784 Is that what this is about?
6889205 6893955 I have treated you more than fair<br />throughout this entire investigation.
6894002 6896302 I gave you the benefit of the doubt<br />over and over.
6896338 6897838 Every time you said something stupid...
6897881 6900261 I thought, "maybe he's just stupid."
6900300 6902840 But I was wrong.<br />That's what this is about.
6902886 6904006 Are these the clubs<br />you don't play golf with?
6904054 6905054 None of that is mine.
6905347 6906927 None of this was put here by me.
6906973 6910523 Those are nice clubs.<br />You got the makings of a real man cave.
6910560 6913690 Everything just waiting<br />until the wife goes away for good.
6913730 6914810 Nick!
6916066 6918986 - You can't do that!<br />- Of course we can.
6927285 6929865 Amy, it's time to move on.
6929913 6931623 What can I do to help?
6932332 6933882 I need some time to think.
6933917 6936417 - That's the last thing you need.<br />- Desi...
6936461 6939051 twenty years,<br />you have kept me dangling.
6939089 6942759 Finally, last night, you came to me,<br />and you chose me.
6943468 6944798 Follow that instinct.
6944844 6947264 Don't trust the instinct<br />that left you beaten and homeless...
6947806 6950976 Sleeping in your car,<br />fearing for your life.
6954312 6957022 I'm not gonna force myself on you.
6959442 6962112 I understand what you're saying, desi.
6963363 6964993 I do.
6968326 6970326 I've been so mistreated for so long.
6972998 6975878 I've forgotten how to behave.
6981631 6983931 I'll move in here tomorrow...
6983967 6986547 And we'll work it out together.
6988638 6992348 I just want you to be you again.
7000191 7001711 They only took margo to fuck with you.
7001735 7003445 She's not spending<br />another fucking second in there.
7003486 7006236 I'm gonna go in,<br />and I'm gonna tell them everything.
7006907 7008657 What?
7010660 7012290 We tell boney very little.
7012329 7014459 Without a body,<br />without a murder weapon...
7014497 7016787 Their only hope is a confession.
7016833 7018793 So, you let them do all the talking.
7018835 7020955 That way,<br />we can jump-start your defense.
7021004 7023384 The truth is my defense.
7029346 7030346 Recognize these?
7030347 7032467 Yes.<br />It's Amy's anniversary present to me.
7032515 7034305 Was that how she told you<br />she was pregnant, Nick?
7034351 7036851 Mommy, daddy, baby,<br />and that made you real mad?
7037354 7038524 No.
7039773 7041893 - Recognize this?<br />- Never seen that before in my life.
7042108 7045358 It's Amy's diary.<br />We found this at your father's house.
7047364 7048664 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7048698 7050698 - He's not a handwriting ex...<br />- Looks like it.
7050742 7051872 Our experts thought so, too.
7053203 7054913 Do you wanna<br />play a little true or false?
7055664 7056874 Sure.
7056915 7061385 "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips<br />so he can taste me."
7062504 7064514 Yeah, that's true.
7065757 7067757 You thought quinoa was a fish?
7069052 7070392 That is also true, yes.
7072555 7074675 She wanted to get pregnant,<br />you assaulted her.
7074724 7076734 I hit her? No, never happened.
7076768 7078388 - "Pushed," it says "pushed."<br />- Absolutely not.
7078436 7079516 I never touched her.
7081940 7083570 She tried to buy a gun.
7084234 7086114 I doubt that, but I don't know.
7087529 7089159 Shall I read the last entry?
7089197 7090237 Sure.
7091533 7093663 "This man may kill me."
7093702 7095912 In her own words,<br />"this man may kill me."
7095954 7098084 It's kind of a convenient end note.
7104588 7106008 For future reference...
7106047 7108377 The truth,<br />you are not a handwriting expert.
7108425 7109475 Okay, I know.
7117892 7119732 Judy's missing handle.
7121271 7123561 Big as a two-by-four, right?<br />Big as a club.
7123607 7126357 We found this day one,<br />in the fireplace in your home office.
7126401 7129071 We didn't know what the hell it was,<br />but fire in July?
7129112 7129952 We bagged it.
7129988 7131108 I've never seen that before either.
7131156 7133776 We just tested it.<br />Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7133825 7136035 So, finally, Nicholas dunne...
7136077 7137697 You're under arrest<br />for the murder of your wife.
7137746 7138956 Do not say another word.
7138997 7140327 - What about my side?<br />- Nick!
7153678 7155138 More coffee?
7155180 7156970 I'd love it.
7159267 7162897 Remember that time we skipped school<br />and drove to the cape?
7162938 7165478 God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.
7165523 7167153 This reminds me of that.
7167651 7169321 Never-ending holiday.
7170862 7173072 You're not bored?
7173114 7174624 Desi, how could I be bored?
7174658 7177118 You can discuss<br />18th-century symphonies...
7177160 7180080 19th-century impressionists,<br />quote proust in French.
7180455 7184575 Nick's idea of culture<br />was a reality TV marathon...
7184626 7186496 With one hand down his boxers.
7188505 7190095 I really have to get going.
7190423 7193763 But I will be back<br />just as soon as I can.
7200350 7201430 My keys.
7206648 7208648 Thank you.
7219869 7221449 That's how the kids wear it.
7282265 7286095 Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.
7288939 7290109 Hey.
7290523 7292903 - Are you okay?<br />- Yes. Are you?
7292943 7294193 Yeah.
7294236 7296106 Let's go.
7297948 7299158 What does this mean?
7299199 7301369 Well, you're out on bond.
7301409 7304619 You can relax at home<br />while we prep for trial.
7310126 7312126 Keep your head down.
7327560 7329940 Tanner, is there<br />any fucking lead on Amy?
7329980 7331980 I've got two of my best guys on it.
7332482 7334112 She's air.
7336152 7339112 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7396338 7398878 Mr. collings is home.
7398924 7401304 Hello, Mr. collings.
7401343 7403223 I've missed you.
7403261 7404891 I've been thinking...
7405347 7407517 I don't wanna be without you.
7408224 7410564 Stay with me.
7410602 7413562 And when all this dies down,<br />we'll go to Greece, like you said.
7413605 7415905 Octopus and scrabble?
7417901 7420151 How long do you think until it's done?
7420195 7423785 Not long. Six months for the trial.<br />Sentencing will be quick.
7424282 7425372 He'll appeal.
7425408 7427538 I can watch the rest overseas.
7444928 7446218 Go slowly.
7446263 7447263 But I want it.
7467617 7469197 Don't rush.
7469244 7471334 Just do it.
7479796 7481336 Harder.
7579896 7583066 You fucking bitch.
7591741 7595411 Don't you worry,<br />you're gonna have lots of babies.
7597038 7600538 Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br />There was semen present.
7600584 7601744 We'll make sure it's a match.
7601751 7603501 Yeah, it'll match.
7603545 7606015 Thank you very much.
7606047 7607547 What do you think?
7607591 7608881 Are we pals again?
7608925 7612465 Now that I know<br />you didn't murder your wife, yes.
7612512 7613512 What do you think?
7613513 7616433 Kidnapping? The story's insane.
7618602 7621062 She's on fairly heavy painkillers.
7621104 7623024 It's okay. I want to help.
7623064 7624484 Ms. dunne, I know<br />what you've been through...
7624524 7626864 So we'll keep this very brief.
7626902 7629282 Can you walk us through what happened?
7631907 7634527 That morning, the doorbell rang.
7635410 7637410 So normal.
7637454 7639294 I opened the door.
7639915 7641755 So strange.
7642375 7645995 Since high school,<br />he won't ever go away.
7646046 7649126 And I've just tried to be nice to him.
7649174 7650804 Answer his letters.
7651051 7653051 Keep him calm.
7654471 7655931 Oh, my God.
7656556 7658176 I've encouraged him.
7658224 7660024 You can't blame yourself.
7661645 7663815 He pushed inside.
7665398 7667438 And he grabbed me.
7668151 7671241 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.
7671571 7673281 And he clubbed me.
7673740 7675160 I collapsed.
7675200 7679250 That club was actually the handle<br />to a punch and Judy puppet.
7679287 7680707 Right.
7681623 7683043 Treasure hunt.
7684960 7687000 I'd hidden some puppets at go's...
7687045 7688765 then how did desi have that handle?
7690632 7692552 I'd just found it.
7693301 7695721 It must have fallen off.
7697639 7701309 I was holding it when desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7701351 7702561 About that woodshed...
7702602 7704272 He took me to his lake house.
7704854 7706564 Tied me to his bed.
7706606 7709146 Back to the woodshed real quick.<br />Real quick.
7709192 7711032 When you went<br />to place the puppets there...
7711069 7712469 Did you notice that it was packed...
7712487 7713647 lots of stuff.
7713697 7718117 Corresponding to purchases made<br />on credit cards in your husband's name.
7718159 7719659 Nick and credit cards.
7719703 7722253 He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.
7722289 7725079 He hid a lot of stuff at go's.<br />They're very close.
7725625 7729955 Now, may I go back<br />to where I was being held prisoner...
7730005 7732765 By a man with a history<br />of mental problems?
7732799 7733880 Please continue, Ms. dunne.
7738179 7740259 Desi assaulted me that night.
7741224 7743064 Every night.
7744185 7746595 He tied me up like a dog.
7747981 7750481 And then, he'd punish me.
7752402 7754452 Starve me.
7755739 7757659 Shave me.
7759284 7761244 Sodomize me.
7762037 7763867 There were cameras everywhere.
7763914 7766874 Please find this. Please find the tapes.
7768543 7771753 She slit his throat with a box cutter.
7772839 7775049 How did she manage<br />to get a hold of a box cutter...
7775091 7777681 If he had her tied up the whole time?
7778637 7780677 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7781473 7783433 Amy, we found your diary.
7783475 7787565 It contains many concerning allegations<br />of mental and physical abuse.
7787604 7790484 Well, it's the ugly truth.
7791316 7792816 Nick didn't want a baby.
7794653 7797953 He has a temper. We had money problems.
7798865 7799985 But I love him.
7800033 7801783 Then why did you try to buy a gun?
7803745 7805825 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7805872 7807712 If I could just clarify one thing...
7807749 7810959 if this case had been left<br />in your deeply incompetent hands...
7811002 7812882 My husband would be on death row...
7813171 7816921 And I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...
7817217 7820887 Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.<br />We're finished.
7821763 7823933 Now, I have to ask you...
7823974 7826814 Do you feel safe<br />going home with your husband?
7839239 7841869 We prayed to God,<br />and God has answered our prayers.
7841908 7843278 Amy dunne is home.
7843326 7845406 Now, I know there are<br />a lot of questions and concerns...
7845453 7847463 But for right now, we wanna sit tight...
7847497 7852417 And just be thankful and grateful<br />for this miracle on the Mississippi.
7859884 7861684 Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.
7913438 7914648 We love you, Amy!
7919277 7921107 All right, you can stop pretending now.
7921154 7922824 I'm not pretending.
7923531 7925241 You were perfect.
7925867 7928407 The Nick I saw on TV,<br />that's the Nick I fell in love with.
7928453 7931163 You do know I was just telling you<br />what you wanted to hear, right?
7931206 7933036 That's how well you know me.
7933083 7935713 You know me in your marrow.
7936711 7938301 Okay.
7938338 7941668 You need to tell me<br />exactly what happened.
7942968 7944218 Take off your clothes.
7944719 7947929 I need to make sure<br />you're not wearing a wire.
7961236 7965236 You killed someone, Amy.<br />You're a murderer.
7965282 7966872 I'm a fighter.
7966908 7969368 I fought my way back to you.
7969411 7971251 You killed a guy.
7971288 7973248 You slashed his throat<br />with a box cutter.
7973290 7977960 You went on national television<br />and begged for me to save your life.
7978545 7979805 And I obliged.
7979838 7981298 But I want that Nick.
7981631 7983051 I'm leaving.
7983091 7985721 You really think that's smart?
7986386 7987386 Shampoo.
7990098 7994018 Wounded, raped wife battles her way<br />back to her husband...
7994060 7995940 And he deserts her.
7995979 7997019 They'll destroy you.
7997772 7999272 Neighbors will shun you.
7999316 8003526 And I'll make sure that no one forgets<br />the pain you caused me.
8005614 8010704 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8011286 8012906 Once they go...
8013724 8014724 I go.
8014748 8018168 Give it the night. Sleep on it.
8035018 8036598 Was there ever a baby?
8036895 8038985 There can be.
8042984 8043994 Good night.
8096913 8098583 Hey, Nick!
8110719 8111969 Hello, handsome.
8115098 8116848 Crepe?
8117494 8118494 Sure.
8118518 8120228 She was his dream girl.
8120270 8123690 And when this spoiled, rich,<br />entitled little boy couldn't have her...
8123732 8125112 He took her.
8132490 8133830 You must be so proud.
8141082 8143082 It's been four hours.
8143585 8146425 Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?
8150592 8153432 Right now, it's all about our marriage.
8154262 8157772 When two people love each other<br />and can't make that work...
8157807 8160227 That's the real tragedy.
8163980 8166020 Kiss my cheek.
8172364 8175164 I can't believe that fucking spider<br />is America's sweetheart.
8175200 8177410 She told me she killed desi.
8177452 8178792 Not self-defense. Murder.
8178828 8180368 - Can't we get a wire?<br />- That's not gonna work.
8180413 8181583 She told you once before.
8181623 8183963 Yeah, because she had me strip naked,<br />and stand in the shower.
8184000 8187250 I swear, you two are the most<br />fucked-up people I've ever known.
8187295 8188755 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8189005 8190835 You and Amy under the same roof?
8190882 8192682 You should pitch that<br />as reality television.
8193301 8195681 Amy dunne,<br />and the miracle on the Mississippi.
8195720 8198220 Nick and I have been through<br />some bad patches.
8198265 8199605 We've had our dark days.
8199641 8201481 But we thank you so much...
8201977 8206517 For supporting us in our new life together,<br />for forgiving Nick.
8206773 8210493 Really, your encouragement<br />means the world.
8210527 8211937 She's good.
8211987 8214567 Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.
8214614 8216704 The real housewives of branson.
8216741 8217831 Take care of this guy, will you?
8217867 8219468 I can't believe you're just leaving now.
8219494 8221044 You are not at risk anymore.
8221079 8222619 I'm the definition of "at risk."
8222664 8226794 You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,<br />you franchised the bar.
8226835 8227885 You may wanna thank her.
8230922 8232342 Just don't piss her off.
8233174 8234174 See you, guys.
8236303 8237973 Elvis has left Missouri.
8238013 8239103 She had to have made a mistake.
8239139 8241429 We need to check Amy's story,<br />piece by piece.
8241474 8243354 Nick, I can't do anything.
8243768 8246598 We had the national spotlight on us,<br />we stained the rug.
8246646 8248366 The case is with the feds now,<br />they're done.
8248398 8249438 That doesn't mean you have to be done.
8249858 8251648 It does.
8283224 8284684 What are you doing?
8286603 8288193 Couldn't sleep.
8288229 8289229 Come on...
8289522 8291692 Let me tuck you back in.
8304371 8307001 You know you can sleep with me, right?
8309084 8311174 Yeah, it's just...
8311211 8312711 I need more time.
8312754 8316304 I would never, ever hurt you.
8318093 8320553 I do need you to participate, though.
8320595 8322755 I need you to do your part.
8333066 8334066 Okay.
8334818 8337648 Everything you have heard<br />about my wife...
8337696 8339066 Is a lie.
8339114 8343204 She is a calculating,<br />murderous psychopath.
8343827 8345367 And I have been complicit...
8345412 8346542 Nick!
8352210 8354380 Nick? Breakfast.
8354421 8355421 Honey?
8358967 8361427 We should hold hands.
8361469 8364559 Not the entire time,<br />but on and off throughout.
8365974 8368184 "So, Nick, how does it feel<br />to have your wife back?"
8370812 8372692 "It's fantastic.
8372731 8375781 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8375817 8377527 "Fantastic" is a little flippant.
8377944 8379074 "Amazing"?
8379112 8381952 I need you<br />to admit that you got the credit cards...
8381990 8384990 And that you hid all that stuff at go's<br />and that you pushed me.
8385744 8388794 I'm gonna need<br />those three things to feel safe.
8389998 8391828 You have to own this, Nick.
8392626 8396166 Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.
8397756 8399506 Nick.
8402469 8405099 What a beautiful home.
8406348 8409018 I so appreciate<br />you giving us this time, Nick.
8409059 8411229 You went on national television...
8411269 8413729 And told people that I murdered my wife.
8413772 8415022 I go where the story goes.
8415065 8418035 You implied that I had carnal relations<br />with my sister.
8418068 8421608 I didn't use the "I" word.<br />I said you two were "extremely close."
8421655 8426335 You and a panel of nitwits<br />diagnosed me as a sociopath.
8427535 8429285 Ice-breaker.
8432999 8434789 To go with your robot dog.
8434834 8436884 I'll go find Amy.
8438922 8441012 She's downstairs.
8443510 8445140 - What is it?<br />- It's for you.
8445178 8446598 Open it.
8446888 8448638 I don't need any more gifts from you.
8448682 8450392 Open it.
8462946 8464606 I didn't touch you.
8464656 8465696 You didn't need to.
8465740 8468950 Bullshit. That notice of disposal.
8468994 8470504 I have that. You threw it out.
8470537 8472367 The notice, yes.
8472747 8473747 I want a blood test.
8474165 8475245 I want a paternity test.
8476042 8477382 I love tests.
8477419 8479249 You can teach those people<br />to hate me all you want.
8479296 8482006 I don't care. I am leaving you.
8484134 8486844 I won't have to teach your child<br />to hate you.
8486886 8489256 He'll do that all by himself.
8489306 8491176 You fucking cunt!
8493059 8495439 I'm the cunt you married.
8495478 8497268 The only time you liked yourself...
8497314 8500984 Was when you were trying to be someone<br />this cunt might like.
8501026 8504486 I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.
8508241 8511491 I've killed for you.<br />Who else can say that?
8512746 8515286 You think you would be happy<br />with a nice midwestern girl?
8515332 8518172 No way, baby. I'm it.
8518209 8521629 Look, you're delusional. You're insane.
8521671 8523171 Why would you even want this?
8523548 8524628 Yes, I loved you.
8524674 8528144 And then all we did was resent each other,<br />and try to control each other.
8528178 8529218 And cause each other pain.
8529721 8531511 That's marriage.
8534184 8536564 Now, I'm getting ready.
8561878 8564958 I can't watch you play house<br />with that thing for the next 18 years.
8565006 8566666 I can't just walk away.
8566716 8568296 You could get custody.
8568343 8572223 No, I won't. And you know it.
8572264 8574774 It's gonna be my child.<br />I'm not gonna leave it.
8575392 8577192 You wanna stay.
8577227 8581147 I have a responsibility.<br />It's not about what I want anymore.
8581189 8582439 You wanna stay with her.
8593076 8594116 You're breaking my heart.
8594578 8598208 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8598248 8600748 I need you with me on this.
8600792 8603252 Of course I'm with you.
8605880 8609880 I was with you before we were even born.
8611636 8614426 We've been through the darkness.
8614973 8618273 We've come out, united.
8621271 8623441 We communicate.
8625734 8628244 We're honest with each other.
8628278 8629778 Right?
8631698 8634198 We're partners in crime.
8637579 8638579 And?
8640290 8641620 And?
8645128 8647048 We're gonna be parents.
8648757 8650377 My goodness!
8650800 8652760 - How exciting!<br />- Thank you.
8657557 8659927 "What are you thinking?"
8662771 8664981 "How are you feeling?"
8666942 8669572 "What have we done to each other?"
8671154 8673244 "What will we do?"
