23875 24876 <i>When I think of my wife...</i>
27295 29798 <i>...I always think of her head.</i>
31258 34052 <i>I picture cracking her lovely skull...</i>
34219 36346 <i>unspooling her brains...</i>
36513 39140 <i>trying to get answers.</i>
40350 43728 <i>The primal questions of any marriage.</i>
43895 46106 <i>"What are you thinking?"</i>
46273 48400 <i>"How are you feeling?"</i>
48567 51194 <i>"What have we done to each other?"</i>
146164 150168 The Irish prince<br />graces us with his presence.
151836 154964 His majesty prefers not to be moistened.
156174 157467 I got you a present.
159052 160387 - I hated this game.<br />- You loved it.
160553 161721 You loved it.
161888 164182 Thank you.<br />I'll add it to the collection.
164974 167143 Can you pour me a bourbon?
173400 175485 What's up, Jitters?
179197 181408 Well, if you're not going to talk,<br />I'm gonna have to fill the silence...
181574 184828 with another excruciating story<br />by Margo Dunne.
184994 187539 I could tell you about<br />my recent customer service experience...
187706 189582 - changing Internet service providers.<br />- I like that one.
189749 192502 Or how about the time I saw that woman<br />who looked exactly like my friend Monica?
192669 194462 But it wasn't Monica.<br />It was a total stranger.
194629 196548 Who was also named Monica.
197006 198508 - Made it kind of interesting.<br />- It's great.
199342 200552 I'm just having a bad day.
200719 202554 - Amy?<br />- It's our anniversary.
202721 204556 - Five years.<br />- Five?
204723 205765 That came fast.
205932 207267 And furious.
211813 214899 <i>I'm so crazy, stupid happy.</i>
217736 219070 <i>I met a boy.</i>
219237 223658 <i>A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.</i>
225910 227078 Excuse me, miss?
227245 228580 I just want you to be careful...
228747 231416 where you put down that<br />monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
231583 234169 because the party's down to three<br />Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.
234335 235920 It might attract<br />some desperate characters.
236087 238923 It could.<br />I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa.
243011 245430 They already relieved me<br />of my artisanal meat platter.
245597 248349 Finally, someone tells me<br />how to pronounce that word.
248516 249350 "Meat"?
249517 250769 Yes, "meat." One syllable.
251102 253646 Thank you. Whose beer am I<br />about to drink?
253813 255106 Don't tell me.
255774 257442 Let's see, who's your type?
257859 258818 I don't see you sitting quietly...
258985 262447 while he bloviates<br />on his postgrad thesis about Proust.
262614 264783 Uh-oh. Is that him?
264949 267160 Ironic hipster, so self-aware,<br />he makes everything a joke.
267452 270455 I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."
272290 273500 What type are you?
273666 275001 Corn-fed,<br />salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.
275168 276169 Missouri?
276336 277128 Cute.
277295 279506 - Native New Yorker?<br />- The world ends at the Hudson.
279672 280632 What's your name?
280799 281633 Amy.
281800 284135 Well, Amy, who are you?
285470 288515 A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.
288681 292727 B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.
292894 296022 C, I write personality quizzes<br />for magazines.
296397 300485 Okay. Your hands are far too delicate<br />for real scrimshaw work...
300652 303780 and I happen to be a charter subscriber<br />to <i>Middling Warlord Weekly...</i>
303947 305156 so I'd recognize you.
305490 306699 I'm gonna go with "C."
306866 308284 And you?
309118 310537 Who are you?
310703 315041 I'm the guy to save you<br />from all this awesomeness.
319128 321840 So, you write for a men's magazine.
322006 325134 God, does that make you an expert<br />on being a man?
325301 326386 No.
327178 328346 It's what to wear, what to drink.
328513 330348 How to bullshit.
330515 331975 Never with you.
332141 332851 Ha, ha.
333017 334519 No, I mean it.
334686 336354 It's hard to believe you.
336521 337188 Why?
337355 338857 I think it's your chin.
339023 340024 My chin?
340191 342735 Yeah, it's quite villainous.
342902 344529 Okay, how's this?
345530 348700 A hundred percent true, no bullshit.
349075 349909 Okay.
350076 351536 <i>We all move to New York...</i>
351703 355707 and we end up living in these little<br />cubby holes, and that's not it.
355874 359335 Come outside. Then, you're in it.
361754 363506 You have to see this.
372056 373057 Hey.
373182 374142 Hey.
383151 384777 I have to kiss you now.
384944 386237 Is that right?
386404 389574 I can't let you go through<br />a sugar storm unkissed.
391409 392577 Wait a second.
395288 396748 There you go.
408676 410094 Nick Dunne...
411846 413932 I really like you.
420104 422357 So, is Amy gonna do<br />one of those anniversary...
423316 424484 treasure hunts?
424651 426527 You mean the forced march<br />designed to prove...
426694 429530 what an oblivious and uncaring asshole<br />her husband is?
429697 430782 Wow.
433618 435203 Life. I don't remember the point.
435370 437455 Deep Hasbro thoughts.
437622 438957 Spin.
439791 441876 What was the clue last year<br />she got so mad about?
442043 445213 "When your poor Amy has a cold...
445380 446965 "this dessert just must be sold."
447131 447966 The answer?
448132 449801 I still don't know the answer, Go.
449968 452011 - A few years ago, you'd have known.<br />- A few years ago, it was fun.
452178 453721 Year one,<br />the traditional gift was paper.
453888 457225 She got me a beautiful notebook.<br />Told me to go write my novel.
457392 458142 What did you get her?
458309 459560 A kite.
459727 461562 - She'd never flown a kite.<br />- Okay.
462522 464983 Anyway. Year four, flowers.
465149 468403 She led me outside<br />to the dying rosebush in the backyard.
468736 469654 That's symbolic.
469821 470655 Yeah.
470822 472156 What's the gift for five?
472323 472991 Wood.
473157 475493 - So, what did you get her?<br />- There's no good gift for wood.
475660 478871 I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,<br />slap her with your penis.
479038 480498 "There's some wood for you, bitch."
484043 485336 The Bar.
486087 488381 Why, yes. Hang on one second.
488548 489716 Hey, it's Watchful Wally.
492010 494012 Hey, Walt. What's going on?
496389 499475 Thanks very much. I'll be right there.<br />All right, bye-bye.
511696 514365 Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?
515575 517076 Thanks, Walt!
532759 534135 Ame?
554489 555948 Amy!
568628 569295 Hello?
569796 571255 Come on in.
572006 572673 Hey.
572840 574133 - Mister Dunne.<br />- Hi.
574300 576677 I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.<br />This is Officer James Gilpin.
576844 578679 We understand there are concerns<br />about your wife.
578846 582767 I don't know where my wife is.<br />And I came home to this.
583810 586604 Now, I don't panic easily...
586938 589023 but it's weird, right?
590274 591275 Mind if we look around?
591526 592318 Please.
592485 593611 How long have you two been here?
593778 596489 Two years in September.<br />We used to live in New York.
596656 597615 City?
597782 600785 Yeah, I was a writer.<br />We were both writers.
600952 602453 Why did you all move back here?
602620 604122 My mom got sick.
604288 607125 Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?
607291 608626 She's dead.
608793 609794 I'm so sorry.
615508 617802 What do you do now, for work?
618678 620513 My sister Margo and I<br />own The Bar downtown.
620972 622682 Oh, The Bar.
622849 624976 Love the name. Very meta.
625143 626227 Thanks.
629188 630982 Pretty things.
635736 636946 Stay.
637113 638865 My office, here.
641909 643953 Beautiful dress.
647957 648624 Date night?
648791 650042 It's our anniversary.
653212 654714 It's a guest bedroom, there.
655006 656507 Cat's room on the end.
656674 658217 I checked up here.
662597 663556 This is the kitchen...
663723 665057 obviously.
680823 682533 This is my wife's office.
682700 684327 Amy's office.
697381 700384 Wow. Impressive gal.
700468 701552 Yeah. Should I be concerned?
701719 702887 I remember these.
704138 705389 I loved these books.
709560 710853 Wait a minute.
711020 713022 Your wife is Amazing Amy?
713606 715816 Yeah. She is.
715983 717610 Wow.
720613 724116 <i>Amazing-fucking-Amy<br />is getting fucking married.</i>
724283 725952 <i>That's how the night started.</i>
726118 732166 <i>With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br />jealous, as always, of the golden child.</i>
732250 736837 <i>Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,<br />who's getting fucking married.</i>
737171 738839 When I was 10, I quit cello.
739006 742593 In the next book,<br />Amazing Amy became a prodigy.
745054 745846 Did you play volleyball?
746097 747848 I got cut, freshman year.
748015 749934 She made varsity.
751352 753229 When did you have a dog?
753396 754397 She got the dog.
755022 757400 Puddles made her more relatable.
757566 758776 Wow.
758943 760945 I love your parents...
761112 762780 but they really can be assholes.
762947 764282 - Nick!<br />- Sir!
764448 766117 Hey, thanks for coming, man.
766284 766951 No problem.
767118 768536 Hey, sweetheart.
769120 770413 Big night for your mom.
770579 774292 It would mean so much<br />if you would talk to a few reporters...
774458 776210 bloggers, give them a little Amy color.
776377 778129 People wanna hear from you.
778296 779797 - We can't stay long.<br />- Fantastic.
779964 782133 Fifteen minutes, tops.
782466 786637 This is why I have my brownstone.<br />My trust fund. I know I can't complain.
786804 789307 Your parents literally<br />plagiarized your childhood.
789473 793394 No, they improved upon it,<br />and then peddled it to the masses.
793561 795646 I thought you were gonna wear white<br />to match the wedding theme.
795813 797148 I thought that would be creepy.
797315 799650 "If it's worth doing,<br />it's worth doing..."
799817 802028 Hold up! I know how this ends.<br />Don't tell me.
802194 803863 You're very cute, Nick.
804030 805531 Amy, you know<br />what would make Dad's night.
805698 807325 I'm on it.
808617 811495 I love having strangers<br />pick at my scabs.
811662 812788 <i>I'm curious whether...</i>
812955 814665 it's difficult for you to see<br />Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
815291 818002 And this big party<br />celebrating this fictional wedding.
818169 820379 Because it's my understanding<br />you are not married.
820546 822214 Is that correct?
823174 826802 Correct. Amazing Amy has always been<br />one step ahead of me.
826969 830806 Excuse me. I'm sorry,<br />I just have a few questions.
831182 831974 It's you.
832141 834685 I'm here in a<br />strictly journalistic capacity.
834977 838189 Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br />of dating Nick Dunne for how long?
838356 841025 - Two magical years.<br />- Two magical years.
841192 842902 In the course of that time,<br />you've had the opportunity...
843069 845404 to perform such gracious gestures as...
845571 849367 not correcting Nick when he<br />pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
849533 850868 An understandable mistake.
851035 852078 He also thought it was a fish.
852244 853829 He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.
854872 857041 You also manage to appear<br />shocked and delighted...
857208 859668 when Nick's elderly mother<br />breaks into an impromptu rendition...
859835 861921 of <i>New York, New York,</i><br />every time she sees you.
862088 864006 <i>These bag of bone shoes</i>
864173 865216 That's just frightening.
865383 867885 You also bought Nick<br />his very first pair of scissors.
868052 869595 And matching stapler.
869762 872556 Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.
872723 876102 You are brilliant,<br />yet entirely un-snobby.
876268 879772 You challenge me. You surprise me.
879939 881273 And, fun fact for the readers...
881690 883401 you have a world-class vagina.
886195 888531 My colleagues tell me<br />that you are not yet married.
889073 890741 Is that correct?
890908 892243 I'm not.
892410 893744 Isn't it time we fixed that?
895204 896747 <i>And then...</i>
896914 899750 <i>the night wasn't so bad anymore.</i>
916100 918477 And it's done. Crossed off the list.
918644 922481 Now, normally, we would not treat this<br />as a missing persons case so quick...
922648 923941 but given the scene at your house...
924108 926110 and given our spike<br />in violent crime of late...
926277 928612 we are gonna take this<br />very, very seriously.
928779 929613 Okay. Good.
929780 932950 We've got forensics over at your place.<br />You got somewhere to stay?
933117 934577 - I could stay at my sister's.<br />- Okay.
934743 936912 We're tracking Amy's phone,<br />her credit cards.
937079 938622 We will organize searches,<br />put up flyers.
938789 941667 - We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.<br />- You're having a press conference?
941834 943294 I wanna get the word out, right?
943461 947756 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,<br />I feel like I'm on a <i>Law & Order</i> episode.
955806 957850 Time is of the essence in these cases.
958017 960644 But, that said,<br />do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?
960811 961812 Absolutely not. I just wanna help.
961979 963647 So, you and Amy<br />have been here two years.
963814 966942 - You tend bar...<br />- I own The Bar.
967109 970488 And I teach creative writing at MVCC.
970654 972323 - No kids?<br />- Not yet.
972490 973824 So, what does Amy do most days?
973991 976202 A woman with all those degrees,<br />what does she do?
976702 977995 I don't know. She keeps busy.
978162 979663 Doing what?
981874 983375 She's a voracious reader.
983542 986378 So, she's always got a book in her hand.
987463 988797 Well, days can get long.
988964 992676 I know a few housewives, that<br />evening glass of wine starts coming at noon.
992843 994011 Or prescription pills.
994178 995554 Just last week, we had a soccer mom.
995721 998057 Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in<br />over some OxyContin.
998224 1000184 Ever since that mall went bust,<br />half the town is out of work.
1000351 1001685 We cannot keep up<br />with the drug violence.
1001894 1004188 I'm pretty sure that's not it.
1004355 1006190 Has Amy got friends we can talk to?
1008192 1009360 No, not really.
1009527 1011362 No friends? This whole town?
1011529 1015032 She was very close with my mom,<br />before she passed away.
1015199 1017034 You know, we have a pretty serious<br />homeless problem...
1017368 1018494 in our neighborhood.
1018827 1020412 I think maybe you guys<br />should check that out.
1021872 1022748 We'll look into that.
1022915 1025417 You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.
1025584 1027044 Where were you before that?<br />Just to cross that out.
1027211 1028045 Well, I was home.
1028212 1030714 I left at 9:30,<br />I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.
1030881 1032383 I went to Sawyer Beach<br />and read the news.
1032550 1034593 Did you visit with anyone there?
1034760 1036720 I kind of go to Sawyer Beach<br />for the solitude.
1037888 1040349 So, your wife has no friends here.
1040516 1042226 Is she kinda standoffish?
1042393 1044687 Ivy League? Rubs people the wrong way?
1044853 1046355 She's from New York.
1047523 1050734 She's complicated.<br />She's got very high standards.
1050901 1051735 Type A?
1052069 1054530 That can make you crazy<br />if you're not like that.
1054697 1057408 You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.
1057575 1059743 Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?
1060286 1061954 God, I don't know.<br />I'd have to look it up at the house.
1062121 1064790 You don't know if she has friends,<br />you don't know what she does all day...
1064957 1066750 and you don't know<br />your wife's blood type.
1066917 1068043 Sure you all are married?
1069795 1070629 Maybe it's type O.
1070796 1072881 - Where are her folks? New York?<br />- Yeah.
1073048 1074633 Can they get here time<br />for this press conference tomorrow?
1074800 1076719 Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br />I haven't talked to them.
1076885 1078596 You haven't called<br />your wife's parents yet?
1078762 1081056 You can't get a signal in this building.<br />I've been in here talking to you.
1081223 1083559 Call them, please, Nick. Now.
1083726 1084935 Fine.
1090441 1092359 Should I know my wife's blood type?
1092443 1093444 No.
1093777 1097448 I apologize, Marybeth.<br />I didn't know what was going on.
1097615 1098991 Now I'm at the station...
1099158 1102661 and the cops are at the house,<br />and it's serious and I'm calling you.
1103370 1106206 There's a lot of things<br />that are being juggled right now.
1106373 1109501 I'm standing right next to<br />Detective Rhonda Boney...
1109668 1111629 who's the lead investigator on this<br />and she's...
1113881 1116050 My mother-in-law<br />would like to speak with you.
1117468 1118636 This is Detective Boney.
1118802 1120012 I wanna go home.
1120179 1122514 I don't know why I have to be here.
1122681 1125184 I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.
1125351 1126477 Dad?
1126894 1128354 This is my father. What's going on?
1128520 1129563 Really? You're Nick Dunne?
1129813 1131690 We've been trying to get a hold of you<br />all afternoon.
1131857 1133400 I've been right there.<br />My wife is missing.
1133567 1134568 - Bitch.<br />- Don't.
1134735 1136987 Your father wandered out of Comfort Hill<br />after lunch.
1137154 1139406 We found him walking Route 79,<br />disoriented.
1139573 1140908 We've been trying to call you<br />for the last...
1141075 1142201 I don't get a cell signal<br />in this building.
1142368 1144328 I've been sitting<br />20 feet away from you.
1144662 1146163 Sir, please<br />don't take that tone with me.
1146330 1147331 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.
1147498 1149041 Dad, stop.
1151710 1152920 You wanna drive him home?
1153587 1155881 I think that would be wise. Thanks.
1175442 1178529 <i>This voice mailbox is currently full.</i>

1237921 1239298 My God.
1239798 1240966 You naughty minx.
1241133 1244094 Well, technically, we are supposed<br />to fuck at the next stop.
1244261 1245763 Yeah, in keeping with tradition.
1245929 1249308 But I might be willing<br />to bend the rules this once.
1249475 1251185 God bless Jane Austen.
1266533 1270537 I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br />It's confirmed by the...
1273499 1275793 Thank you.
1276835 1278295 Year two. Cotton.
1285052 1289181 We had that joke that our sex<br />was too good for ordinary.
1289348 1291809 So, these are 2,000 thread-count...
1296855 1299650 We're so cute.<br />I wanna punch us in the face.
1299817 1303028 That's pretty great.<br />I mean, that is pretty great.
1304488 1305823 Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?
1305989 1308158 I don't need a lawyer.<br />Here, I'll do this.
1308659 1310494 Well, did they ask personal stuff<br />about Amy?
1310661 1311829 You know, they asked...
1312162 1313497 why didn't she have any friends?
1313664 1314373 What did you say?
1314540 1316542 - I said she was complicated.<br />- Nick!
1317543 1320170 Everyone knows "complicated"<br />is code for "bitch."
1325592 1327261 God. I feel sick.
1327427 1328846 Thanks.
1329847 1331014 It's so bizarre.
1331181 1333559 It seems like the kind of thing<br />that would happen to Amy.
1333725 1334768 She always attracts...
1334935 1336520 Drama?
1337354 1338605 You can say it. It's just me and you.
1338772 1341191 Just because<br />I don't like to be around Amy...
1341358 1342609 doesn't mean I don't care about her.
1345696 1347865 Anyway, whoever took her<br />is bound to bring her back.
1357207 1359126 Detective? Excuse me.
1359293 1361920 I'm Noelle Hawthorne.<br />I'm Amy's best friend.
1363046 1365716 Well, great. Where do you live, Noelle?
1366258 1367634 Five doors down. 1032.
1367801 1369887 Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.
1370053 1371805 Can I come by in half an hour?
1371972 1373557 - Y'all know anything yet?<br />- I'm sorry.
1373724 1376393 I got guys on the clock in here.<br />But you give me 30 minutes.
1376560 1377895 But that's usually bath time.
1378645 1381231 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.
1383984 1385152 All right. So, what do you got?
1385319 1387946 It was definitely blood spatter<br />you saw in the kitchen.
1388447 1389990 Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.
1390157 1392409 Not that weird,<br />but that is awfully high.
1392576 1394077 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.
1394244 1395412 Well, okay.
1398123 1399082 Interesting.
1399249 1400250 What's that?
1400417 1403795 House is rented in her name.<br />Car's in her name.
1403962 1406965 Credit cards, utilities,<br />phone bill, all in her name.
1407132 1408842 Even his bar's in her name.
1409009 1410802 I don't know that that's so surprising.
1410969 1412471 No. But it is humiliating.
1412638 1413430 What you got?
1413597 1416433 It's with her unmentionables.
1428779 1431657 Well, we have our first clue.
1442751 1444294 I have to take a shower.
1444461 1446129 No, don't. You've been up all night.
1446296 1448465 You wanna look<br />like you've been up all night.
1450092 1452302 Hey, be careful today, okay?
1452469 1453679 That's a weird thing to say.
1453845 1457474 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.<br />You can seem angry, like...
1457641 1459017 Please don't say, "Like Dad."
1459184 1461812 Or else you swing into your momma's-boy<br />charm offensive and that can feel glib.
1461979 1462646 Perfect.
1462813 1465440 I'll balance on the exact fucking edge<br />of your emotional razor.
1465607 1467317 Okay. Just be...
1467484 1469277 Myself?
1469444 1471655 <i>...sponsoring a raffle to<br />benefit West County 4H...</i>

1486545 1487462 - Hi, Rand.<br />- Hey, man.
1487629 1488338 I'm Detective Boney.
1488505 1490340 I'm the twin. Margo.
1490507 1493468 We played tennis yesterday, Nick.<br />I just can't get over it.
1493635 1494845 Marybeth, I am really sorry.
1495012 1496680 I knew you never should have<br />moved back here.
1496847 1497848 We didn't have a lot of choice.
1498015 1501560 We are all worried. We are all scared.
1501727 1506189 But we are all here now.<br />And we will find Amy, together.
1516408 1518201 Should I just go first, and then<br />you guys can say something?
1518368 1519327 Good.
1520996 1525208 As you know, my wife,<br />Amy Elliott Dunne...
1525375 1528170 disappeared from our home<br />on the morning of July 5th...
1529129 1531548 under suspicious circumstances.
1531715 1533050 Louder!
1533216 1537471 If anyone out there<br />has any information...
1537679 1539890 please come forward.
1540057 1541683 Thank you.
1544019 1546730 I'm Rand Elliott.<br />My wife, Marybeth Elliott.
1546897 1547981 Should I have said my name?
1548565 1550400 Amy is our only child.
1550567 1554571 She's bright, she's beautiful.<br />She's kind.
1555072 1556573 She really is Amazing Amy.
1556907 1559493 You know, there are<br />millions of people out there...
1559659 1562079 who grew up with her and care about her.
1562245 1564873 We care about her, we love her.
1565582 1568168 And we just want her back.
1570087 1572589 Amy is a decorated scholar.
1572756 1575592 She forged a successful career<br />in journalism.
1575759 1577928 She returned here<br />to her husband's hometown...
1578095 1580430 and she made a life in her adopted home.
1581515 1583767 Now, Amy needs your help.
1583934 1587938 We're establishing a volunteer<br />headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
1588105 1593443 We have a hotline, 1 -855-4-AMY-TIPS.
1593693 1599116 And our website is<br />www.FindAmazingAmy.com.
1599616 1601576 - Mr. Dunne!<br />- Mr. Elliott!
1602953 1604788 Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?
1606540 1610210 Mr. Elliott, when was the last time<br />you spoke to your daughter?
1611711 1612712 Smile.
1619302 1620887 That's all for now. Thank you.
1623473 1626184 Amy is the kind of girl<br />who attracts admirers.
1626351 1627102 Right, Nick?
1627269 1628311 Yeah, definitely.
1628478 1630856 And we've had instances...
1631022 1632941 - where things got...<br />- Scary.
1633108 1634442 Do you know about Desi Collings?
1634609 1636153 Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings.
1636319 1637445 He was obsessed.
1637612 1640824 He attempted suicide after Amy<br />broke up with him sophomore year.
1640991 1642409 We had to file a restraining order.
1642576 1644828 This would be high school?<br />Twenty years ago?
1644995 1648081 But he recently moved to St. Louis.<br />That's just two hours away.
1648248 1650000 To be fair, he is from St. Louis.
1650167 1651668 We also have Tommy O'Hara.
1651835 1653920 This is only eight years ago,<br />in New York.
1654087 1656256 She broke up with him,<br />he got very physical.
1656423 1657966 - She filed charges.<br />- What was the charge?
1658133 1660093 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?
1660260 1662095 I only know it was bad.
1662262 1663930 - I didn't know this.<br />- Okay.
1664097 1665891 Thank you.
1666057 1667350 Anything more recent?
1670687 1672689 Not that I know of.
1675150 1678069 Hey, Nick? You got a minute?
1679237 1680864 Yeah.
1686244 1687495 Imagine our confusion.
1687662 1688705 A missing persons case...
1688872 1691333 and in your wife's dressing room,<br />we find an envelope marked "clue."
1691499 1693627 That's for our anniversary.
1693793 1695962 My wife does these treasure hunts.
1696129 1698381 I'm hoping you can tell me<br />what this means.
1698548 1699549 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?
1699966 1702177 It'll help me track Amy's movements<br />before she disappeared.
1702510 1704554 Of course. Okay.
1704721 1707307 "Although this spot<br />couldn't be tighter...
1708058 1710769 "it's a cozy room<br />for my favorite writer."
1713605 1714814 I know this one!
1715315 1718818 <i>Although this spot<br />couldn't be any tighter...</i>
1719444 1722239 <i>it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.</i>
1723740 1727035 <i>After-school meeting,<br />don't mind if I do.</i>
1727202 1730121 <i>Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.</i>
1734167 1736378 Well, well. What does it say?
1736544 1738046 Clue two.
1739172 1742550 "Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.
1743051 1746930 "You'll be the spy,<br />and I'll be his lover.
1747430 1748431 "Let's head on over...
1748515 1750267 "to the little brown house.
1750433 1754145 "We'll play hot, doting husband,<br />sweet, loving spouse."
1757190 1757941 These yours?
1758817 1759693 No.
1759859 1761194 But you read the first clue.
1761361 1764364 Randy professor, naughty student.
1764531 1765448 I blush.
1765615 1767367 Me and my ex just swapped cards.
1768576 1769828 Where's this little brown house?
1769995 1771496 I have no idea.
1814706 1816082 Hello?
1816750 1818626 Nicholas Dunne.
1819294 1822380 Under my father's name, William Dunne.
1828803 1832766 My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?<br />Can you just turn the bell...
1832932 1833767 Yeah, I know.
1833933 1835560 It's... It's...
1838021 1840315 It's "Puddles", right?<br />Or is it "Poodles?"
1844235 1845862 We're good.
1847447 1848448 Hello, stranger.
1848615 1850617 Fancy meeting you here.
1850784 1852952 It's your dad's house, right?
1853119 1854621 Are you following me?
1854788 1855538 What you doing?
1855705 1857749 Like you said, it's my dad's house.
1857916 1860627 I come by once a week,<br />make sure the place hasn't burned down.
1862420 1863713 But it looks okay.
1864464 1866341 I'll walk you out.
1869594 1870970 You know...
1871137 1874265 I thought maybe<br />this was the little brown house.
1874432 1875517 From the clue.
1875683 1877644 Nope. Still blue.
1894119 1898206 <i>Picture me,<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.</i>
1898373 1902085 <i>I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished", I mean "had."</i>
1902585 1905713 <i>It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.</i>
1906005 1909759 "So open the door, and look alive."
1911052 1912095 Bitch!
1915807 1918810 <i>Want to test your marriage<br />for weak spots?</i>
1919477 1920937 <i>Add one recession...</i>
1921271 1922564 <i>subtract two jobs.</i>
1923148 1925150 <i>It's surprisingly effective.</i>
1925316 1927610 Promise me we'll never be like them.
1927777 1928778 Like who?
1928945 1930572 All those awful couples we know.
1930738 1934576 Those wives who treat their men<br />like dancing monkeys...
1934742 1936202 to be trained and paraded.
1936828 1939539 Husbands who treat their wives<br />like the highway patrol...
1939914 1942500 to be out-foxed and avoided.
1947255 1948923 I think I'm gonna be laid off.
1949716 1952385 We're in a recession.<br />If it happens, we'll deal with it.
1952552 1954637 I'll probably be next.
1954804 1956055 We have each other.
1956431 1958975 Everything else is background noise.
1960059 1961853 You are exceptional.
1969569 1970820 My turn.
1972697 1976034 My parents' publisher dropped them,<br />and they're in debt up to their ears.
1976201 1976910 That's terrible.
1977076 1979370 And they need to borrow<br />from my trust fund.
1979537 1980914 How much?
1981080 1983291 Almost a million.
1983875 1985335 That's almost all of it.
1985502 1987670 This is where you say,<br />"Everything else is background noise."
1987837 1988755 Amy, if you're laid off...
1989047 1990173 and I'm laid off...
1990340 1991341 I said I'd do it.
1991508 1992634 Without talking to me?
1992800 1994260 - Well, it's...<br />- Your call.
1994427 1996012 ...their money, technically.
2000433 2002101 You know what? You're right.
2002727 2004729 Everything else<br />is just background noise.
2013696 2014697 Hey.
2018826 2019869 More games?
2020036 2021663 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.
2022872 2024332 What's the laptop for?
2025416 2026417 Laptop-ing.
2028670 2029462 I see.
2029629 2032632 You can give your parents $879,000<br />without talking to me...
2033174 2035677 but God forbid I buy a video game<br />without getting your permission.
2035843 2036761 You are spending a lot.
2036928 2039055 You don't trust me.<br />You don't trust my judgment.
2039222 2040640 You certainly don't trust my intention.
2040807 2041641 What are you talking about?
2041808 2043309 That's the basic tenet<br />of a prenup, isn't it?
2043476 2045603 Why are you throwing that<br />in my face again?
2045770 2047188 Because it's easy to throw.
2047355 2048022 Nick, I don't get it.
2048189 2051401 I don't get why you're daring me<br />to be someone I don't wanna be.
2051568 2054529 The nagging shrew.<br />The controlling bitch.
2054696 2056948 I'm not that person. I'm your wife.
2057115 2058157 I'm sorry.
2058324 2060535 I just don't know how to do this.<br />I've never not had a job.
2060702 2062579 I flipped burgers, I painted houses.
2062745 2064747 You'll get another job.
2069168 2070378 Hi, Go.
2072130 2073756 What? Hold on. What?
2073923 2075216 <i>- And suddenly...</i><br />- Slow down, what is it?
2075383 2077260 <i>...I knew everything<br />was about to get worse.</i>
2077427 2079012 Okay, tell me what's wrong.
2106372 2107874 - Bless you, Nick.<br />- Father.
2108541 2109834 Hey, Tom. Mayor!
2110001 2111127 Nick, good to see you.
2111294 2112170 Good to see you.
2112337 2113588 Hey, guys, hey.
2116007 2117508 - Jodie.<br />- Nick.
2119218 2120845 Oh, we'll find her.
2135818 2137403 You look like hammered shit.
2137570 2139238 Thank you.
2147330 2148790 You ever see that guy<br />in the glasses before?
2149707 2152335 Don't worry. We videotape everybody<br />that comes in and out of these things.
2152502 2154170 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...
2154337 2155254 Do-gooders?
2155421 2156506 Freaks.
2156673 2158508 Hey, I meant to ask you.
2158675 2160134 Noelle Hawthorne?
2161010 2162720 She lives on your street.<br />Amy's best friend.
2163846 2165056 I've never heard the name<br />Noelle Hawthorne.
2165223 2167266 She and her husband have triplets.
2167433 2168309 Oh.
2168726 2171562 Yeah, we might say hi to them<br />on the street.
2171938 2174107 But "best friend"? No.
2174649 2175858 Excuse me, one sec.
2180154 2182115 He acted like<br />Noelle was a complete stranger.
2182281 2183366 Of course he did.
2183741 2184909 Look, these two are yours.
2185076 2187328 Oh, look. He's being a good guy...
2187495 2189288 so everybody can see him<br />being a good guy.
2189455 2191124 You really don't like him, do you?
2191290 2192792 What's to like?
2214480 2217984 <i>This mailbox is currently full.<br />Press one to...</i>
2218151 2221529 Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.<br />My name's Shawna Kelly.
2221779 2224365 I am so sorry for your troubles.
2224532 2225324 Thank you. That's kind.
2225491 2226784 Are you remembering to eat?
2226951 2227952 Well, a lot of cold cuts.
2228119 2232165 I'm gonna fix you up<br />my world-famous chicken Frito pie.
2232331 2233708 That's very kind and very unnecessary.
2233875 2235501 You have to keep your strength.
2236043 2237003 Would you...
2237920 2239797 say, "Chicken Frito pie!"
2244010 2245303 You know what?
2246554 2247805 Would you delete that picture for me?
2247972 2249724 - It's a nice photo.<br />- I know it is.
2249891 2251184 But just do me a favor.
2251350 2252977 Will you?
2253144 2255938 Would you go ahead<br />and please delete that picture?
2256105 2256773 You just press...
2257148 2258524 What is wrong with you?
2258691 2259859 Could you please not<br />share that with anyone?
2260026 2263362 I will share it with whomever I please.
2267158 2268409 - Dude.<br />- Yeah?
2268576 2269911 Marybeth is pissed.
2270620 2271412 Why?
2274290 2275750 Marybeth?
2275917 2279337 It's like you're the goddamn<br />Homecoming King.
2281756 2284091 It was important to my mother<br />that I be polite...
2284258 2286052 I be considerate, I be a gentleman.
2286219 2287804 It looked like you were having fun.
2287970 2290223 I am in a nightmare!
2290932 2293226 All I'm trying to do is be nice...
2293392 2297104 to the people who are<br />volunteering to help find Amy.
2299065 2300817 You're right.
2301692 2303653 And I'm sorry.
2305655 2309283 My God, this place literally<br />smells like feces.
2320253 2323464 In your searches,<br />did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?
2323631 2325049 No.
2326175 2327760 How about a brand new Stratocaster?
2327927 2329053 No, nothing like that.
2329762 2331848 Well, all right.
2336853 2339772 How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.
2339939 2341107 No, it's nowhere near that.
2341274 2342358 Okay.
2342817 2344110 - Kibble?<br />- Excuse me?
2344277 2346237 He asked me to feed his cat.
2346404 2347613 I saw some in the pantry.
2347947 2352577 Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?<br />Noelle Hawthorne!
2352743 2354203 I know y'all are in there!
2354370 2358875 Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne<br />and her children back out to the street?
2359750 2361711 Detective Boney!
2361878 2365715 Just remind her<br />it is a possible crime scene.
2374432 2379270 <i>Look at that pie-eating grin,<br />from a guy whose wife is missing.</i>
2385067 2386652 - How are you doing?<br />- Terrific.
2388404 2389780 How's Marybeth?
2389947 2391657 She's a wreck.
2391824 2393284 And you?
2393910 2395411 Awesome.
2395578 2396412 Hey...
2396579 2398164 have you told me everything?
2398414 2399248 Of course.
2399415 2400249 Everything?
2400416 2401459 Why would you even ask me that?
2401626 2405796 Ever since you walked into The Bar that<br />morning Amy went missing, you seem...
2407089 2408090 - off.<br />- I am off.
2409133 2412345 Everybody's examining me<br />and projecting their shit on me.
2412511 2415806 All I want is to come over here,<br />have a beer with you...
2415973 2417183 and not be judged.
2417350 2418851 Can we do that?
2419936 2421270 Of course.
2422647 2424523 You know what I keep thinking?
2424690 2425608 If Mom were here?
2425775 2429195 Yeah. Like I'm 12.
2430655 2433449 Nick, Mom would fix it.
2440665 2443876 I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.
2446796 2449131 - Love you.<br />- Love you.
2453469 2455388 <i>So, here's a strange, new sentence.</i>
2455554 2459016 <i>I am a Missourian.</i>
2465815 2467191 Bye, Dad.
2469110 2472446 <i>No money, no jobs, no prospects.</i>
2472613 2474657 <i>And then, we heard from Go.</i>
2474824 2476617 <i>Mama Maureen...</i>
2476784 2479620 <i>Stage 4 breast cancer.</i>
2481789 2484500 <i>So, we moved to Missouri.</i>
2484667 2486168 <i>I don't mind.</i>
2486335 2489505 <i>I just wish he'd asked.</i>
2501183 2503602 <i>Nick is happy to be home.</i>
2503686 2506188 <i>But I don't know<br />if he’s happy I'm with him.</i>
2507690 2510818 <i>I feel like something<br />he loaded by mistake.</i>
2510985 2514030 <i>Something to be jettisoned,<br />if necessary.</i>
2514196 2516407 <i>Something disposable.</i>
2518242 2520870 <i>I feel like I could disappear.</i>
2564872 2566749 Oh, my God!
2566916 2568751 - I saw you on TV.<br />- Okay.
2568918 2570461 - It's so crazy.<br />- Yeah, I know.
2570628 2572713 - She just vanished?<br />- She's just gone.
2572880 2574590 - I've been so worried about you.<br />- Where have you been?
2574757 2576467 I called you a hundred times.<br />You gotta pick up your phone!
2576634 2577551 Rehearsals.
2577718 2578636 What?
2578803 2580096 <i>Godspell.</i>
2581931 2583390 My sister's asleep in the other room.
2583557 2584558 I needed to see you.
2584725 2586268 I know this is a bad idea.
2586435 2587812 Can you at least tell me you love me?
2587978 2591607 I do love you, but we have<br />to be really careful right now.
2591774 2592900 I've been so scared.
2593067 2594151 Between rehearsals?
2594318 2595945 You told me<br />I needed to have my own life.
2596112 2597488 I know.
2597655 2598781 We need to stop.
2598948 2600116 I need you.
2601242 2603077 Touch me.
2606497 2609125 Stop it. Come here.
2610501 2612086 Sit down.
2612253 2613462 Okay.
2613629 2617591 Did you, by any chance,<br />tell anybody anything about us?
2617758 2619135 Even in texting, or on Facebook.
2619301 2621971 Facebook? I use the disposable phone.
2622138 2623931 You buy my presents in cash.<br />I'm not stupid, Nick.
2624098 2626851 I know, sweetie.<br />Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office?
2627017 2630312 I don't know. Maybe.<br />They better be mine.
2630479 2631313 Sweetheart, think.
2631480 2633816 I don't know. I'd have to check<br />my red panty inventory.
2633983 2636485 Andie, I need you<br />to take this seriously, okay?
2636652 2638320 This is the last time<br />we're gonna see each other, until...
2638487 2639947 Until when?
2640489 2641824 Until it's safe.
2641991 2643450 You were going to get a divorce.
2643617 2645661 Never say that out loud again.
2645828 2648497 Okay. I'm sorry.
2649373 2650332 I don't wanna fight.
2652376 2653836 I just wanna be with you.
2654003 2655171 Andie, please...
2656005 2657673 That's all I want.
2659008 2660092 I can't.
2662428 2664555 It's our last time together.
2664722 2666765 Let's make the most of it.
2673522 2676859 Real quick, but then you have to go.
2679695 2682364 <i>My husband has come undone.</i>
2682531 2685367 <i>We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...</i>
2685534 2688245 <i>but as it turns out, we couldn't.</i>
2691540 2693292 It means a lot that you came.
2694460 2695711 <i>We took a hit on the brownstone...</i>
2695878 2698214 <i>and I used the last of my trust fund<br />to buy him a bar.</i>
2698964 2701217 <i>So far, it's just costing money.</i>
2705429 2709225 <i>Nick uses me for sex when he wants.</i>
2712394 2714897 <i>Otherwise, I don't exist.</i>
2716148 2718108 We should go to Outback tonight.
2718275 2719401 That would be nice.
2719568 2722655 <i>Last night, I went from desperate<br />to pathetic.</i>
2723572 2726617 <i>I became someone I don't even like.</i>
2726784 2728577 <i>The kind of woman I used to mock.</i>
2728994 2730579 You're out so much.
2730746 2732957 - I know.<br />- Stay home.
2733123 2735334 - I can't, I'm already late.<br />- Then, can I come?
2735501 2737169 You would hate it.
2737336 2740589 It's a bunch<br />of my dorky high school friends.
2741590 2744468 Do our code. No bullshit.
2744927 2747304 I thought<br />we weren't gonna be that couple.
2753811 2755646 Okay, bye.
2757314 2760150 - Hey, I've been thinking.<br />- Yeah?
2760317 2761694 Something positive.
2763112 2764154 Maybe it's time.
2765447 2767157 Now is literally the worst time.
2767324 2768367 It would be a new start for us.
2768784 2771370 And for me,<br />I would have a real purpose here.
2771537 2772621 A child is not a hobby.
2772788 2773789 Not a hobby.
2774790 2776000 An inspiration.
2776542 2779545 We could have had this fight<br />four hours ago. I'm late.
2779712 2780838 I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.
2781005 2784300 You really wanna be the couple<br />that has a baby to save their marriage?
2784466 2785467 "Save"?
2785968 2788012 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!
2788178 2790222 - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br />- Yeah!
2790389 2792808 You're a fucking coward.
2792975 2794727 No, it can't go on like this.
2794893 2795811 Really?
2795978 2797354 - I won't.<br />- You won't?
2797521 2799732 You won't?<br />Why, it's not good enough for you?
2799898 2800691 It's not even close!
2800858 2802985 You stupid bitch!
2803569 2806405 <i>What scared me<br />wasn't that he'd pushed me.</i>
2806572 2810409 <i>What scared me was how much<br />he wanted to hurt me more.</i>
2810743 2812828 <i>What scared me<br />was that I'd finally realized...</i>
2813829 2817499 <i>I am frightened of my own husband.</i>
2829386 2830763 You want me to call for backup?
2830929 2833015 Nah, I'll protect you.
2840773 2842191 Jesus.
2847237 2849907 They ought to burn this place down.
2850366 2852034 Seems like folks are trying.
2857539 2859708 You really think this is anything?
2859875 2862044 Cross it off the list.
2873138 2874723 Hey, Jason.
2874890 2876308 What's up, Rhonda?
2876475 2878727 "...and dedicated to the proposition<br />that all men..."
2879812 2882314 - Have you seen this girl around here?<br />- Why do you ask?
2882564 2884400 She was reported missing.
2887569 2889321 "...and so dedicated, can long endure."
2889488 2891281 Yeah. I remember her.
2891448 2893575 What did she want?<br />Weed, pills?
2895244 2896245 She wanted a gun.
2896495 2898414 I told her it's not my thing.
2898580 2901458 I felt bad, though.<br />She seemed really desperate.
2901625 2905087 She said it needed to be small,<br />so she could keep it close.
2905254 2906964 Are you sure this is her?
2907131 2909258 You don't forget a girl like that<br />in here.
2910259 2911635 She was all in pink.
2911802 2914346 It was Valentine's Day.
2917307 2919935 <i>For Valentine's Day,<br />I thought I'd buy a gun.</i>
2920102 2922688 <i>That is how crazy I've become.</i>
2923772 2927776 <i>Nick wants me gone<br />but he won't ask for a divorce.</i>
2927943 2931947 <i>In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,<br />his only line of credit.</i>
2932114 2933615 <i>The bitch with the prenup.</i>
2935451 2937661 <i>I could go home to my parents...</i>
2937828 2940122 <i>but I'd have to tell them the truth.</i>
2940289 2944001 <i>And I don't even know<br />if I believe the truth.</i>
2944168 2946962 <i>Can I really think Nick would hurt me?</i>
2947588 2949965 <i>I'm being paranoid. Crazy.</i>
2951300 2951967 <i>It's just...</i>
2953260 2955804 <i>I'd sleep better with a gun.</i>
2966690 2967983 Oh, shit.
2968150 2971778 Wake up, baby.<br />My sister's gonna come out here.
2976158 2978368 - Sorry to rush you.<br />- It's okay.
2980329 2981663 - Here. Let me help you.<br />- Okay.
2981872 2983957 Just get that.
2986627 2988128 Be very careful.
2988962 2989838 I'm all right.
2990005 2992466 Here you go.
2992633 2994384 Promise me we'll talk every day.
2994551 2995677 Okay, we will.
2995844 2998555 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.
2999348 3000307 Don't go crazy.
3000474 3001725 Okay.
3006146 3009358 You fucking idiot.
3009525 3013362 You fucking asshole!<br />You fucking lied to my fucking face!
3014863 3016406 I'm sorry.
3018200 3019159 How old is she?
3019535 3020744 She's in her early 20s.
3021662 3022496 How long?
3023205 3025874 - A year and a half.<br />- You lied to me for over a year?
3026041 3027584 If I told you,<br />you would have made me stop.
3027751 3029211 It's so fucking small.
3029378 3032214 You're a liar and a cheat!<br />You're just like Dad!
3032381 3033549 How did you even meet her?
3033715 3034925 She's one of my students.
3036176 3037719 I thought writers hated clichés.
3037886 3038595 I'm not a writer.
3038762 3040889 "Boo-hoo, I got laid off.<br />I guess I'll fuck a teenager."
3041056 3043725 It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br />no idea how shitty it was with Amy...
3043892 3045686 how fucking terrible she made me feel.
3045852 3048897 Flyover Boy.<br />I would get knots in my stomach...
3049064 3050774 just coming home,<br />knowing she would be sitting there...
3050941 3052943 dissatisfied, before I even<br />walked in the fucking door.
3053110 3054403 This is so bad.
3054570 3056530 If anybody finds out,<br />you're totally fucked.
3056697 3059199 Boney found a pair of panties<br />in my office...
3059366 3060909 where, occasionally, Andie and I...
3061368 3062369 I don't know what the fuck it means.
3062536 3063579 Are they Super-Twat's?
3063745 3065706 Her name is Andie.
3065872 3067249 She's not entirely sure.
3067416 3068959 So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...
3069126 3070419 who isn't sure<br />where she leaves her undies?
3070586 3072713 If they're not Andie's,<br />that means that they're Amy's...
3072879 3074464 and she left them there for me to find.
3074631 3078260 Nick, I was scared for you before,<br />and now, I'm fucking petrified.
3078427 3080596 We're having a vigil tonight<br />for your missing wife...
3080762 3083765 and this morning, you're kissing<br />your college girlfriend goodbye!
3083932 3085100 Can you imagine?
3085726 3088937 Have you watched television lately?
3089104 3092107 Cable news is all over your shit.
3092733 3094443 <i>I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?</i>
3094610 3096778 <i>His wife's nowhere to be found...</i>
3096945 3100490 <i>and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.<br />Cute pic, huh?</i>
3100657 3102993 - Who is that?<br />- Some fucking tragedy groupie.
3103160 3104953 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- I don't know.
3105120 3106121 She was trying to give me a casserole.
3106288 3109291 <i>On the show today<br />we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt...</i>
3109458 3112002 <i>patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.</i>
3112294 3115672 <i>Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider<br />defending Nick Dunne?</i>
3115839 3116840 <i>Well, let me just say...</i>
3117007 3119635 <i>as always, Ellen,<br />thank you for such a warm welcome.</i>
3119801 3121345 <i>But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.</i>
3121637 3124014 <i>Listen, just because this guy<br />isn't walking around weeping...</i>
3124181 3125474 <i>that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.</i>
3125641 3128852 <i>Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath<br />is a lack of empathy.</i>
3129019 3130979 <i>But the truth is,<br />you'd have to be a sociopath...</i>
3131480 3133148 <i>to behave normally in this situation...</i>
3133315 3135942 <i>because it's the most<br />abnormal situation in the world.</i>
3136109 3138654 <i>Tanner, are you trying to tell me<br />that this photo...</i>
3138820 3140947 <i>is remotely in the realm<br />of acceptable behavior?</i>
3141114 3143784 I'm so sick<br />of being picked apart by women.
3145160 3147037 You need to hire Tanner Bolt.
3149122 3149790 I don't deserve this.
3149956 3151708 <i>Innocent until proven guilty.</i>
3151875 3154127 That's exactly what you deserve.
3154294 3155837 Go home, Nick.
3181822 3183240 Hey, buddy.
3199131 3200799 I can't believe<br />we haven't arrested this guy.
3200966 3202801 We're not gonna arrest anybody...
3202968 3204469 just because some blonde dunce says so.
3204886 3207389 Why are you going so easy on him?<br />You got a crush?
3207681 3210892 One, I am conducting an investigation,<br />not a witch-hunt.
3211059 3212853 And, two,<br />don't talk to me that way, ever.
3213019 3214187 She was trying to buy a gun.
3214354 3216398 We don't know who<br />or what was scaring her, Gil.
3216565 3217482 Give me the update.
3218066 3220569 No drug angles panned out yet,<br />so cross that off the list.
3220736 3222571 I talked to the nurses<br />who care for Nick's father.
3222738 3225323 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten,<br />so cross that off the list.
3225490 3226533 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3226700 3229995 So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br />like the 4th of July.
3230162 3231329 - Whoa.<br />- Yeah.
3231496 3232497 The blood is profuse.
3232664 3234750 It is Amy's, type B,<br />and we should have DNA soon.
3234916 3235876 Thoughts on a weapon?
3236042 3237836 Trajectory indicates blunt force.
3238003 3240338 Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
3240922 3244050 She fell there,<br />but I doubt she got back up.
3244217 3245510 Amy's medical records come in?
3245677 3247679 No, we'll have them later tonight.
3249264 3250682 My wife says he's a killer.
3250932 3253268 Well, if Tiffany says...
3278877 3279878 Hey.
3280212 3281213 Hey.
3285634 3286635 Thank you all for coming out.
3288470 3289971 Hey Donnie, how are you?
3290138 3293475 Rich, thank you so much.
3300774 3301775 Hey.
3308824 3312285 <i>Thank you, folks.<br />Thank you for being here tonight.</i>
3312452 3314246 <i>It just means the world to our family.</i>
3314788 3316248 And to Amy.
3316832 3318834 As you all know...
3319668 3322838 my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...
3323004 3324506 disappeared three days ago.
3325090 3328510 And I want to implore anyone<br />who has any information at all...
3328677 3331471 please come forward. Help us.
3331638 3332430 So hot.
3332597 3333849 He is so creepy.
3334015 3337352 I wanna say something, because I think<br />some of you might be wondering...
3337519 3339437 and are too polite to ask.
3339938 3343024 I had nothing to do<br />with the disappearance of my wife.
3343608 3345443 I'm cooperating with the police.
3345610 3347529 I haven't hired a lawyer.
3347696 3348822 I have nothing to hide.
3350115 3352617 Amy is my soul mate.
3352868 3354160 She is brilliant...
3354703 3357789 she's charming, and wise.
3358123 3359833 I love you, Amy.
3363962 3365046 Asshole.
3366381 3368300 I love my wife...
3368675 3369885 so much.
3372387 3376725 And I may not behave for the cameras<br />the way they want me to...
3377142 3380228 and if they wanna punish me for that,<br />that's okay.
3380395 3383982 But I just wanna ask you in the media,<br />please, harass me...
3384149 3387068 but don't harass<br />the people of this town.
3387235 3389154 If you need to mock somebody, mock me.
3389321 3390405 Nick!
3390572 3392240 But please don't turn this investigation<br />into a circus.
3392741 3394200 Where's your wife, Nick?
3394367 3395869 Let the police do their jobs.
3396328 3397913 What did you do to your pregnant wife?
3399748 3400874 Did you tell them that, Nick?
3401041 3403084 Did you tell them<br />Amy was six weeks pregnant?
3406838 3409007 Thank you for your support tonight.<br />Let's find Amy.
3411176 3412594 Go ahead,<br />if you guys wanna say something.
3416890 3418266 Gil, go, go.
3420602 3421603 Nick, where are you going?
3421770 3423229 Stop him!
3423396 3425607 No questions right now. Thank you.
3428109 3429653 Why are you running away?
3430737 3432155 Don't run.
3433239 3434240 Everybody, stay back.
3439037 3441081 Guys, come on. You know better.
3441247 3443583 Get off the grass, get down to the curb.
3443750 3445043 - Hey, Gil...<br />- On it.
3445210 3446127 All right.
3446294 3448046 All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.
3448129 3449422 Hello?
3450173 3451591 Hello?
3451758 3452467 Fuck.
3452634 3454010 You scared me. Want a drink?
3454177 3455553 Did you know she was pregnant?
3455720 3457722 I told you,<br />Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.
3457889 3458932 She doesn't even know Amy.
3459599 3461017 They look like pretty good friends<br />to me.
3468775 3472070 Look, I don't know.<br />But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
3472237 3473321 We have her medical records coming.
3473488 3475240 - Good.<br />- So, let's talk while we wait.
3475407 3477492 Let's start over here.<br />The scene of the crime.
3477659 3480412 You see, we've seen dozens<br />of home invasions.
3480578 3482414 Dozens and dozens.
3482580 3484666 This area right here, it looked wrong<br />from the second we saw it.
3484833 3488003 The whole thing looked staged.<br />Watch this.
3489921 3493341 And yet, they remained upright<br />throughout this life-and-death struggle?
3493758 3495385 I don't know.<br />What do you want me to say?
3495552 3497053 Did you do any housekeeping<br />the day your wife went missing?
3497220 3498054 No.
3498221 3500348 Because our guys did a luminol test.
3500515 3503059 And I'm sorry to tell you,<br />but that kitchen lit up.
3503226 3505353 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.<br />A lot.
3505520 3506354 Oh, my God.
3506521 3507731 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.
3507897 3510233 Wait a second.<br />Why would they mop up the blood...
3510400 3511860 if they're trying to stage<br />a crime scene?
3512027 3514654 No blood and no body<br />suggests kidnapping.
3514821 3517115 It tells us,<br />look at people outside the house.
3517282 3518575 Like these homeless you keep mentioning.
3518742 3521703 A pool of blood and no body<br />suggests homicide.
3521870 3523747 It tells us to look at people<br />inside the house.
3523913 3526499 - Which is what we're doing here, Nick.<br />- I see.
3526666 3529502 So, how was your marriage, Nick?<br />Because right now, all we got is Noelle.
3529669 3531087 She says, "Not good."
3531254 3532630 Gil, what do you and your wife<br />argue about?
3532797 3534799 - What pisses you off?<br />- Money, lack thereof.
3534966 3536593 Me and my ex, it's the same.
3536760 3539971 I mention that because<br />we got a look at your finances, Nick.
3540138 3542724 $117,000 in credit card debt.
3542891 3544726 - What?<br />- I pulled up some of the merchandise.
3544893 3546770 There are these fun little splurges.
3546936 3548354 I didn't buy any of this stuff.
3548521 3549522 I don't even golf!
3549689 3550899 I do! You bought great clubs.
3551066 3552233 I like the robot dog.
3552400 3554235 This is identity theft!<br />This is a felony!
3554402 3555236 We need to find out who did this!
3555403 3557030 All right.<br />Let's talk about life insurance.
3557197 3559616 Because in April,<br />you bumped up Amy's life insurance...
3559783 3560658 to $1.2 million.
3560825 3563078 Yes, I did. That was her idea.<br />She wanted me to.
3563244 3564287 You filed the paperwork.
3564454 3565663 Because she told me to!
3566498 3567290 Hold on a sec.
3567457 3569250 Yeah? Okay.
3571169 3572337 For sure?
3572754 3573922 All right.
3578009 3578968 She was pregnant.
3583098 3584599 This is insane.
3584766 3587143 So, my question becomes...
3587310 3590105 I don't want to talk<br />to you again, ever...
3590271 3591439 without a lawyer.
3599781 3600782 Margo!
3611668 3612669 Hey.
3615046 3617340 Just hold on a second. Let me finish.
3617507 3618299 Nick?
3618466 3621136 I hear you, I hear you.<br />I was as surprised as...
3621302 3625140 I know you're upset.<br />I had no idea she was pregnant.
3625557 3628685 Listen, I thought so, too,<br />but evidently that wasn't...
3631187 3633189 You want to know the truth?
3633356 3635733 The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.
3638153 3640196 Well, I'm as surprised as...
3641531 3643324 You told me you didn't want kids.
3644325 3645577 I was trying to put a good face on.
3645743 3647495 Then, suddenly,<br />you've got a pregnant wife.
3647662 3648872 That's a problem for you.
3649038 3652000 Especially when you factor in<br />the secret teenage girlfriend.
3652167 3653501 Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!
3653668 3655003 You have to fucking talk to me!
3657672 3661593 I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids<br />because she didn't want me to.
3661759 3663845 Because it would have just been<br />another reason for you to hate her.
3664012 3665763 And we had enough of those already!<br />It was easier to just...
3665930 3668016 - Lie to me?<br />- I wanted kids!
3668183 3670226 When we first moved here,<br />I went to a fertility clinic!
3670393 3671936 - It didn't work?<br />- I did my part!
3672103 3673021 Masturbate.
3673188 3674772 When it came time for Amy to do her thing,<br />all of a sudden it was like...
3674939 3676357 "Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."
3676524 3678526 Now, who would believe you?
3679694 3680904 All right.
3690538 3692207 This is a letter from the clinic...
3692373 3694709 notifying me<br />that they're gonna destroy my sample...
3694876 3696878 unless I contact them.
3698129 3699547 So, I gave it to Amy.
3699714 3702592 The next day, I saw it in the trash.
3702759 3704219 But you were already with Andie<br />by then, right?
3704385 3707096 I wanted a baby with Amy.
3707263 3711434 A year ago, Amy being pregnant<br />would have been the best thing ever!
3717982 3719734 "When your poor Amy has a cold,<br />this dessert just..."
3719901 3721152 This is the clue you couldn't solve.
3721319 3722445 Yeah.
3724155 3727408 A letter from Desi.<br />That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
3727575 3729827 It was the fucking rich guy<br />who would do anything for her.
3729994 3731829 It just kept hanging over my head.<br />It was disgusting.
3731996 3732956 Your prenup?
3733331 3736167 Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br />It's like a little box of hate.
3736334 3738127 I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!
3741005 3744008 I love you no matter what.
3744175 3745426 But you need to tell me.
3745593 3747011 Tell you what?
3747845 3749472 What are you asking me?
3751057 3754227 Are you asking me<br />if I killed my wife, Go?
3754686 3756646 Is that what you're asking me?<br />If I murdered my wife?
3756813 3759232 I would never ask you that!
3763194 3764195 Margo!
3777000 3779210 Don't walk on the glass.
3780920 3783548 You have no clue, do you?
3801357 3802942 Why was he here that night?
3804569 3807280 His wife is missing. Why come here?
3807447 3808364 Who cares?
3808656 3809782 Rhonda, we got this.
3809949 3811326 Let's make the arrest.
3811492 3813453 Do you know how hard it is<br />to make a murder case without a body?
3813619 3814454 No.
3814579 3816622 Well, it's incredibly hard.
3816789 3819542 So, I want one last thing.
3819709 3820543 What's that?
3822337 3824630 I want a body.
3825798 3830094 <i>Picture me.<br />I'm a girl who's very, very bad.</i>
3830261 3831888 Be careful.
3836434 3840855 <i>I need to be punished,<br />and by "punished", I mean "had."</i>
3845401 3846402 Fuck.
3848363 3851199 <i>It's where you keep goodies<br />for anniversary five.</i>
3852450 3854494 <i>So, open the door...</i>
3854660 3855912 Punish. Wood. Beach.
3856079 3858581 <i>...and look alive.</i>
3861709 3864295 Punish. Wood.
3865463 3867048 Wood.
3899163 3901749 <i>I will practice believing<br />my husband loves me...</i>
3901916 3904335 <i>and will love this baby.</i>
3905002 3908631 <i>That this child<br />might really save our marriage.</i>
3909507 3910967 <i>But I could be wrong.</i>
3917140 3919058 <i>Because sometimes...</i>
3920059 3922270 <i>the way he looks at me...</i>
3923354 3924981 <i>I think...</i>
3925148 3926232 <i>man of my dreams...</i>
3928151 3930236 <i>father of my child...</i>
3931028 3935032 <i>this man of mine may kill me.</i>
3936409 3938411 <i>He may truly...</i>
3939328 3940079 <i>kill me.</i>
3943040 3943916 WTF?
3968983 3971569 <i>I am so much happier now that I'm dead.</i>
3976616 3978201 <i>Technically, "missing."</i>
3979035 3980703 <i>Soon to be presumed dead.</i>
3982413 3983539 <i>Gone.</i>
3984499 3987627 <i>And my lazy, lying, cheating,<br />oblivious husband...</i>
3987793 3991088 <i>will go to prison for my murder.</i>
3992381 3994800 <i>Nick Dunne took my pride<br />and my dignity...</i>
3994967 3997345 <i>and my hope and my money.</i>
3997512 4000973 <i>He took and took from me<br />until I no longer existed.</i>
4001140 4002433 <i>That's murder.</i>
4002600 4005394 <i>Let the punishment fit the crime.</i>
4005978 4008981 <i>To fake a convincing murder,<br />you have to have discipline.</i>
4013194 4016197 <i>You befriend a local idiot.</i>
4019742 4022912 <i>Harvest the details<br />of her humdrum life.</i>
4023287 4026874 <i>And cram her with stories<br />about your husband's violent temper.</i>
4028000 4030294 <i>Secretly create some money troubles.</i>
4030545 4033714 <i>Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.</i>
4036342 4038427 <i>With the help of the unwitting...</i>
4038594 4040596 <i>bump up your life insurance.</i>
4042306 4045351 <i>Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.</i>
4045518 4048813 <i>Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.</i>
4049272 4053776 <i>You need to package yourself so that<br />people will truly mourn your loss.</i>
4053943 4056904 <i>And America loves pregnant women.</i>
4057238 4060116 <i>As if it’s so hard to spread your legs.</i>
4060283 4061576 <i>You know what's hard?</i>
4062076 4063911 <i>Faking a pregnancy.</i>
4064078 4066247 <i>First, drain your toilet.</i>
4067957 4070585 <i>Invite pregnant idiot into your home...</i>
4070751 4073254 <i>and ply her with lemonade.</i>
4078426 4080595 <i>Steal pregnant idiot's urine.</i>
4082805 4084181 <i>Voilà.</i>
4084348 4088311 <i>A pregnancy is now part<br />of your legal medical record.</i>
4094817 4096152 <i>Happy anniversary.</i>
4098821 4101449 <i>Wait for your clueless husband...</i>
4101616 4103492 <i>to start his day.</i>
4104952 4106287 <i>Off he goes.</i>
4106454 4108623 <i>And the clock is ticking.</i>
4109790 4112293 <i>Meticulously stage your crime scene...</i>
4112960 4116964 <i>with just enough mistakes<br />to raise the specter of doubt.</i>
4118382 4120343 <i>You need to bleed.</i>
4120676 4121385 <i>A lot.</i>
4122303 4123971 <i>A lot, a lot.</i>
4127308 4129143 <i>A head wound kind of bleed.</i>
4129810 4132313 <i>A crime scene kind of bleed.</i>
4135316 4137318 <i>You need to clean poorly...</i>
4137485 4138319 <i>like he would.</i>
4139195 4141697 <i>Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.</i>
4142323 4144909 <i>And leave a little something behind.</i>
4145576 4147328 <i>A fire in July?</i>
4148871 4149830 <i>And because you're you...</i>
4149997 4151248 <i>you don't stop there.</i>
4151666 4153751 <i>You need a diary.</i>
4153918 4156837 <i>Minimum, 300 entries<br />on the Nick and Amy story.</i>
4157505 4159674 <i>Start with the fairy tale early days.</i>
4159840 4162009 <i>Those are true. And they're crucial.</i>
4162176 4164178 <i>You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.</i>
4164512 4167014 <i>After that, you invent.</i>
4167181 4168015 <i>The spending.</i>
4168182 4169850 <i>The abuse. The fear.</i>
4170017 4172853 <i>The threat of violence.</i>
4173020 4174980 <i>And Nick thought he was the writer.</i>
4175690 4176982 <i>Burn it just the right amount.</i>
4178818 4180695 <i>Make sure the cops will find it.</i>
4185700 4188744 <i>Finally, honor tradition<br />with a very special treasure hunt.</i>
4191330 4194083 <i>And if I get everything right,<br />the world will hate Nick...</i>
4194166 4196752 <i>for killing his beautiful,<br />pregnant wife.</i>
4196919 4199422 <i>And after all the outrage,<br />when I'm ready...</i>
4199588 4201424 <i>I'll go out on the water<br />with a handful of pills...</i>
4201590 4204009 <i>and a pocket full of stones.</i>
4204176 4206846 <i>And when they find my body,<br />they'll know...</i>
4207012 4210182 <i>Nick Dunne dumped his beloved<br />like garbage.</i>
4210349 4212560 <i>And she floated down<br />past all the other...</i>
4212727 4216063 <i>abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.</i>
4217440 4219400 <i>Then, Nick will die, too.</i>
4220276 4222027 <i>Nick and Amy will be gone.</i>
4222194 4224196 <i>But, then, we never really existed.</i>
4224363 4227450 <i>Nick loved a girl<br />I was pretending to be.</i>
4227616 4228367 <i>"Cool Girl."</i>
4229076 4232788 <i>Men always use that<br />as their defining compliment.</i>
4232955 4233914 <i>"She's a cool girl."</i>
4235082 4236083 <i>Cool Girl is hot.</i>
4236250 4237543 <i>Cool Girl is game.</i>
4237710 4238627 <i>Cool Girl is fun.</i>
4239044 4241422 <i>Cool Girl never gets angry at her man.</i>
4241589 4244216 <i>She only smiles in a chagrined,<br />loving manner...</i>
4244884 4247720 <i>and then presents her mouth for fucking.</i>
4247887 4249764 <i>She likes what he likes.</i>
4249930 4253392 <i>So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster<br />who loves fetish manga.</i>
4254435 4257605 <i>If he likes Girls Gone Wild,<br />she's a mall babe...</i>
4257772 4261442 <i>who talks football<br />and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.</i>
4261609 4265070 <i>When I met Nick Dunne,<br />I knew he wanted Cool Girl.</i>
4265237 4267782 <i>And for him, I'll admit,<br />I was willing to try.</i>
4267948 4269950 <i>I wax-stripped my pussy raw.</i>
4270618 4273746 <i>I drank canned beer<br />watching Adam Sandler movies.</i>
4273996 4276624 <i>I ate cold pizza<br />and remained a size two.</i>
4276832 4278793 <i>I blew him semi-regularly.</i>
4280127 4281462 <i>I lived in the moment.</i>
4281754 4284298 <i>I was fucking game.</i>
4284924 4286967 <i>I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.</i>
4287802 4290971 <i>Nick teased out of me<br />things I didn't know existed.</i>
4291138 4294308 <i>A lightness, a humor, an ease.</i>
4294475 4297269 <i>But I made him smarter. Sharper.</i>
4297436 4300940 <i>I inspired him to rise to my level.</i>
4301106 4304860 <i>I forged the man of my dreams.</i>
4307196 4309990 <i>We were happy pretending<br />to be other people.</i>
4310157 4311992 <i>We were the happiest couple we knew.</i>
4313619 4316622 <i>And what's the point of being together<br />if you’re not the happiest?</i>
4317289 4319375 <i>But Nick got lazy.</i>
4319542 4321627 <i>He became someone<br />I did not agree to marry.</i>
4321794 4324964 <i>He actually expected me<br />to love him unconditionally.</i>
4325631 4330010 <i>Then he dragged me, penniless,<br />to the navel of this great country...</i>
4330177 4334014 <i>and found himself a newer,<br />younger, bouncier...</i>
4334181 4335182 <i>Cool Girl.</i>
4337518 4341689 <i>You think I'd let him destroy me<br />and end up happier than ever?</i>
4342189 4343858 <i>No fucking way.</i>
4344233 4346026 <i>He doesn't get to win.</i>
4356370 4360332 <i>My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,<br />Missouri guy.</i>
4362751 4365212 <i>He needed to learn.</i>
4365921 4368549 <i>Grown-ups work for things.</i>
4369091 4371051 <i>Grown-ups pay.</i>
4372428 4375014 <i>Grown-ups suffer consequences.</i>
4378517 4379727 Wait.
4380102 4382771 I need 20 seconds where you<br />don't judge me, interrupt me...
4382938 4384565 or get angry.
4386025 4387568 Okay.
4391530 4393365 Is that all the stuff<br />from the credit cards?
4393532 4396577 Where do you store goodies<br />for anniversary five?
4396744 4397411 Wood.
4397578 4400581 - Woodshed.<br />- Yeah, my woodshed.
4400748 4403250 That fucking bitch.
4405085 4406295 - I thought...<br />- It's all right.
4406462 4407922 I would have, too.
4411383 4412468 What's that present?
4412635 4414261 I don't know.
4414428 4416388 Let's find out.
4422978 4426774 "Dear Husband, I know you think<br />you're moving through this world unseen.
4426941 4428233 "Don't believe that for a second.
4428400 4430444 "I know where you've been,<br />and I know where you're going."
4433906 4435824 "For this anniversary,<br />I've arranged a trip.
4435991 4437743 "Follow the river, up, up, up.
4437910 4440496 "Sit back and relax,<br />because you are done."
4440663 4441956 What's "up, up river"?
4442122 4444124 "Up the river." Prison.
4444333 4446126 Fucking crazy bitch.
4446293 4447795 That's what this is.
4447962 4450130 She's framing me for her murder.
4450297 4451465 You married a complete psychopath.
4451632 4453592 The morning of our anniversary...
4453801 4457972 I was gonna ask her for a divorce.<br />I just couldn't do it.
4458138 4460474 I couldn't fake it for another year,<br />another day.
4460641 4461433 Then what happened?
4461600 4462768 Before I could say anything, she said...
4462935 4466188 "I need you to go somewhere<br />and really think about our marriage."
4466355 4467481 She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.
4467648 4468816 So you'd have no alibi.
4468983 4471193 She stage-managed me.
4471485 4475030 She knew exactly what I would do.<br />And I fucking did it.
4475197 4476615 I went to the beach,<br />I thought about our marriage.
4476782 4478367 I came back<br />and decided I wanted a divorce.
4478534 4479618 And by the time you got home...
4479785 4481328 She was gone.
4481954 4482705 You fuck!
4482871 4484456 She's good.
4485457 4487334 Part of me was relieved...
4487501 4489795 when I thought she was gone.
4494174 4495884 Punch and Judy puppets.
4498887 4501849 Remember, he beats Judy to death<br />and kills that baby.
4502016 4503142 So I'm Punch.
4504143 4506145 We already knew that, Amy,<br />what's your point?
4507312 4510149 Does Missouri have the death penalty?
4537051 4538469 Hey, neighbor.
4539386 4541764 It's been weeks<br />since I had anyone decent next door.
4542389 4544892 Well, I don't know how decent I feel.
4545059 4548062 As long as you don't own a python<br />and blast death metal at 4 AM...
4548228 4550105 we're gonna be best friends.
4550272 4552232 All right. Nice meeting you.
4552399 4553984 I'm Greta.
4554610 4555778 I'm Nancy.
4555944 4557780 Are you going to the marina?<br />I could use some creamer.
4557946 4559239 I'm sorry. I can't.
4559406 4560616 I've got work to do.
4560908 4562951 All right. See you around!
4563243 4565162 You will.
4611125 4616338 Come on.<br />Show me that darling Nicky smile.
4618132 4620008 You asshole.
4635482 4636984 Hey.
4639778 4641530 Nancy.
4643824 4645659 Nancy.
4646660 4648871 It's hot again today.
4651165 4653000 So, where are you from?
4653500 4654668 Let me guess.
4657796 4658630 Nebraska.
4661008 4662217 New Orleans.
4665679 4668056 You know, I am an expert oiler.
4668223 4669892 Oh, I just bet you are.
4670058 4672686 Lotions and balms. Ointment.
4673395 4675189 I would hate<br />for y'all to get tan lines.
4675355 4677357 So sweet.
4678192 4680861 Okay. You know where I'll be.
4683739 4686158 I see we have the same taste in men.
4687868 4689995 I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.
4690162 4693207 Least you could do<br />is not keep his secrets for him.
4694249 4695500 Let me guess.
4695667 4699546 He's trying to watch the big game<br />and you just won't shut up.
4699838 4702549 No, you don't seem<br />like much of a talker.
4702716 4703550 I got it.
4703717 4706053 You caught your boy rubbing up<br />on some hot little skank...
4706220 4707930 and he apologized to you<br />by busting you a good one.
4710599 4711391 Worse.
4711725 4712726 Worse?
4713560 4717147 I went to the bar where he works<br />to surprise him.
4717314 4722027 <i>And out he comes with this girl<br />who had no business being in a bar.</i>
4724988 4726990 <i>On the very first night that we met...</i>
4727241 4731411 <i>we walked by a bakery<br />that was having their sugar delivered.</i>
4732246 4734498 <i>And it was in the air, everywhere.</i>
4734665 4736833 <i>A sugar storm.</i>
4737000 4739002 <i>And before he kissed me...</i>
4739169 4741255 he leaned in...
4742756 4745050 <i>and did this.</i>
4755727 4758063 <i>- And guess what.<br />- What?</i>
4758230 4759940 He did the exact same thing with her.
4764194 4767072 That is the most disgusting thing<br />I ever heard.
4767239 4768949 Thank you.
4783714 4785299 Thanks very much.
4792097 4794391 Well, we've gone mainstream.
4809990 4812993 It's an appeals process,<br />so we will attempt to appeal to them.
4813160 4815287 Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?
4817164 4818457 Nick Dunne.
4818623 4820917 I have been sitting by the phone,<br />my friend.
4824379 4825505 I'm sorry.
4825672 4827382 Do you not believe me?
4827549 4830677 No, I believe you.<br />It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
4830844 4834181 I love it. But, for you, it sucks.
4834890 4838060 But you gotta have a grudging respect<br />for your wife at this point, right?
4838226 4839686 - Are you laughing me out of the building?<br />- No!
4839853 4841480 Are you kidding me? I'm in.
4841646 4842981 I'm way in.
4843148 4845650 You came to the right guy.<br />This is what I do, Nick.
4845817 4849112 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.<br />I win the unwinnable cases.
4849279 4850822 $100,000?
4850989 4852407 We'll figure something out.
4852574 4853450 I'll give you a special...
4853617 4856411 "my wife is skilled<br />in the art of vengeance" rate.
4856578 4857496 Okay.
4857662 4859164 So, what's the plan?
4859331 4861083 Well, right now,<br />it's a "he said, she said."
4861249 4863585 - She's telling a better story.<br />- No, Nick.
4863752 4865587 She is telling the perfect story.
4865879 4869049 So, we need to start today<br />to prepare your defense, should we need it.
4869216 4871593 - And if we decide to go with your version of...<br />- The truth.
4872511 4875722 Then we'll need to realign<br />the public's perception of Amy.
4875889 4878016 Make them stop seeing her<br />as America's sweetheart...
4878183 4881520 and see her for what she is,<br />which a mind-fucker of the first degree.
4881937 4885774 Now, that is a huge realignment.<br />We'll need other voices besides yours.
4885941 4888068 There has to be someone out there<br />that she's screwed with in the past.
4888235 4891196 There's a New York guy.<br />O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
4891363 4893615 Eight years ago,<br />she pressed charges against him.
4893782 4895951 That should be easy to find.
4896493 4899746 Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.
4899913 4901498 She said that he stalked her.<br />He's in St. Louis.
4903083 4905335 You go talk to Tommy,<br />and I'll draw up the contract.
4909631 4912634 I told you, you came to the right guy.
4914845 4916054 Apparently.
4925105 4926773 Tommy?
4926940 4928483 Yeah.
4928900 4930861 - Thanks for seeing me.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4933947 4935657 You're gonna want a drink.
4936199 4937409 Yeah.
4937576 4940245 <i>So, she said you got physical with her.</i>
4940412 4943248 No, dude, she said I raped her.
4943415 4945792 First degree, felony rape.
4946543 4948253 - Did you do it?<br />- Did you do it?
4949421 4951506 I was looking at 30 years to life.
4952048 4953467 - Did you get a trial?<br />- Fuck, no.
4953633 4955719 Do I look like<br />I would do well in the yard?
4955886 4958805 I pled down, man.<br />Sexual assault one, no jail time.
4959222 4960765 - That's something.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4960932 4962225 I've been unemployed<br />for the last eight years...
4962392 4964769 because I have to write "sexual offender"<br />on every job application.
4964936 4967772 I'm on a neighborhood watch list,<br />because I have to register as a predator.
4967939 4971276 I haven't had a date in almost a decade,<br />because if a girl googles me...
4973236 4975155 Could you walk me through what happened?
4975447 4978450 I meet Amy at this party, you know?
4978617 4980118 We click. She's perfect.
4980285 4982496 She's beautiful,<br />she's smart, she's well-read...
4982662 4984831 she's got an ass<br />like a 20-year-old stripper.
4984998 4986666 I think, "What's the catch?"
4986833 4990003 A few months, it hits me.<br />This is not going to be easy.
4990670 4993590 Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?
4993757 4997093 She annexed me.<br />She made me her business.
4997260 5000931 It was just too much.<br />She went out and bought me ties.
5001097 5003183 And we must have gone<br />20 rounds over that.
5003350 5005977 Ties. The whole thing just became...
5006144 5009814 - So, you broke up with her.<br />- No, I just backed away.
5009981 5012651 Gave her some space. No big deal, right?
5012817 5014361 So I thought.
5014528 5016696 Then one night,<br />Amy comes over to my place...
5016863 5019658 with a bottle of bourbon<br />and a bootleg of this band I love.
5019824 5022702 And within two minutes,<br />she's got my pants around my ankles...
5022869 5024329 and she is kneeling down, and...
5024496 5026373 I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.
5026540 5028291 - You had sex?<br />- Yeah, consensual.
5028458 5030544 It was rough,<br />but she was screaming for it.
5031002 5033338 Next morning,<br />there's two cops at my door.
5033672 5036466 Amy has wounds<br />that are consistent with rape.
5036633 5039678 Ligature marks on her wrist,<br />and my semen.
5039844 5043390 It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,<br />and raped her.
5043557 5044891 Me!
5045058 5046685 And then, guess what they find.
5046851 5048895 Headboards of my bed, one on each side.
5049312 5050522 The ties you wouldn't wear.
5050689 5052023 You do know your wife.
5052691 5054401 - Did you ever see her again?<br />- Yeah.
5054568 5055986 On TV, last week, with you.
5056570 5057862 I thought, "There's Amy.
5058029 5062033 "She's graduated from being raped<br />to being murdered."
5065870 5066913 You been watching this, too?
5067080 5068164 <i>Last night's bombshell.</i>
5068331 5069249 We just found out...
5069416 5072252 <i>Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,<br />pregnant when she went missing.</i>
5072752 5075589 <i>Kelly Capitono,<br />this makes me wanna throw up.</i>
5075755 5078592 <i>What is it about a pregnant woman,<br />a woman carrying life inside her...</i>
5078758 5080093 <i>that turns men into animals?</i>
5080260 5081761 <i>Ellen, this is an epidemic.</i>
5082053 5084180 <i>The third leading cause of death<br />among pregnant women...</i>
5084347 5086600 <i>is homicide committed by<br />a boyfriend or husband.</i>
5086766 5089519 <i>Let's not forget about the wife, ever.</i>
5089686 5093607 <i>Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,<br />Noelle Hawthorne.</i>
5093773 5096026 <i>Thanks for being on the show, Noelle.</i>
5096192 5097360 <i>Thank you, Ellen.</i>
5097527 5098903 <i>And let me just say this...</i>
5099070 5102532 <i>Amy would have loved you,<br />and all you do for women.</i>
5102699 5103617 <i>Oh, that's nice.</i>
5103783 5105785 <i>Why don't you tell us<br />about your friend, Noelle?</i>
5105952 5108371 <i>Amy was so nurturing.</i>
5108538 5110790 Oh, I'd love if just once,<br />someone was like...
5110957 5112250 "She was a real rag."
5114753 5117213 <i>She was beautiful and smart and kind.</i>
5117380 5119299 Seems like a rich bitch to me.
5119466 5121968 What do you mean? People love her.
5122135 5124554 I don't know. She seems uppity.
5126264 5128642 Spoiled rich girl,<br />married a cheating asshole.
5128808 5129893 Paid the ultimate price.
5130060 5133396 <i>The only secret was her husband.<br />We never met Nick.</i>
5133563 5135065 <i>He never introduced himself.</i>
5135231 5137484 <i>Why was that, Noelle? Why do you think?</i>
5137651 5138652 <i>I think we know why.</i>
5139444 5141571 <i>Because he had a violent temper.</i>
5141738 5142656 A little harsh.
5142822 5144282 That's life, baby.
5144449 5145742 <i>He knew I'd have<br />seen right through him.</i>
5146951 5148161 Don't get me wrong.
5148328 5150080 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
5150246 5153667 I'm just saying, there are consequences.
5155794 5156670 Fuck, yeah.
5156836 5159130 <i>She was so alone.</i>
5159297 5161091 <i>And she was so innocent.</i>
5161257 5164594 <i>You're a good friend, Noelle.<br />And you're a good friend of the show.</i>
5164761 5165845 <i>Thanks for coming on.</i>
5166012 5167347 Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.
5167514 5169683 Tanner Bolt landed me.
5169849 5173019 I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings<br />on my way home.
5173186 5175021 And, Go...
5175188 5178358 Tanner's retainer is $100,000.
5178817 5180276 That's just the retainer.
5180652 5184155 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.<br />I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
5184322 5187283 <i>I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house.<br />We will go from there.</i>
5187450 5189202 Thank you.
5189953 5191496 - I love you.<br />- I love you, too.
5191663 5194290 <i>Nick keeps his father,<br />who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.</i>
5194457 5196543 <i>Number of times he visited last year?<br />One.</i>
5196710 5197544 Oh, fuck!
5197711 5200296 <i>His twin sister, Margo,<br />well, she is a peach.</i>
5200463 5202799 <i>These two spend their days<br />in the bar Amy bought them.</i>

5209889 5211725 <i>While I never examined Nick,<br />or his sister...</i>
5212517 5214644 <i>they both seem very, very close.</i>
5214978 5216229 It's twin-cest.
5216563 5219149 <i>Disturbingly close, Lauren.</i>
5219315 5221192 <i>And so, we close with a question.</i>
5221359 5222736 <i>What kind of moral rot...</i>
5222902 5227490 <i>allows a beautiful, talented,<br />kind, smart, loving mother...</i>
5227657 5231244 <i>to vanish without<br />the heavens hearing our outraged cries?</i>
5231411 5232328 Can I bum a cigarette?
5232495 5236249 <i>Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about you,<br />and we will not forget.</i>
5236750 5238835 <i>And you know what else we won't forget?</i>
5239002 5241254 <i>Missouri has the death penalty.</i>
5241421 5242589 Amen.
5268448 5270617 I'd like to report<br />some strange activity...
5270784 5274287 near the woodshed<br />on the property of one Margo Dunne.
5315495 5316955 Hey.
5322502 5324629 - Mr. Dunne.<br />- Mr. Collings.
5325630 5328591 I know you.<br />I saw you at the volunteer center.
5328758 5330468 I wanted to help.
5331261 5332846 I hope you don't mind me coming by.
5333012 5336099 I got your address from this letter<br />that you wrote my wife.
5336975 5340353 Amy and I believe<br />in the lost art of letter-writing.
5340520 5344357 I always wondered<br />why you kept in touch after...
5345024 5346192 everything.
5346359 5348653 You were together for two years<br />in boarding school, right?
5348820 5350864 She was my first serious girlfriend.
5351030 5353700 - Why did you break up?<br />- That's a strange question.
5353867 5355702 Did you treat her bad?<br />Did you cheat on her?
5355869 5356953 That's a rude question.
5357120 5358705 Let me tell you what Amy told me.
5358872 5361708 She dumped you,<br />you completely unraveled.
5361875 5363835 You stalked her, you threatened her...
5364002 5367380 and you attempted suicide in her bed<br />and were institutionalized.
5367547 5371342 Your wife is missing,<br />and you came all this way to tell me this?
5371509 5373720 I thought there might be<br />another side to this story.
5377390 5379225 Mr. Collings.
5381311 5383229 Fuck.
5388860 5391738 <i>...the missing persons case<br />of Amy Elliott Dunne.</i>
5391905 5395575 <i>She is the beautiful blonde inspiration</i><br /><i>for the</i> Amazing Amy <i>kids' book series.</i>
5412759 5414844 You're reading that diary again?
5415011 5415929 You know how it ends.
5416095 5418431 It interests me.
5418598 5420058 Hey, Rhonda.
5420224 5422018 "He's gonna kill me." The end.
5422185 5424187 Why did he go to his dad's house<br />to burn it?
5424354 5425355 It's private. There's no one there.
5425521 5428191 Why didn't he make sure<br />it actually burned?
5428358 5431194 Because he tripped the alarm.<br />You were up his ass with a flashlight.
5431361 5433571 The whole thing just feels hinky.
5433738 5435698 Like finding an envelope marked "Clue."
5435865 5436866 You ever hear the expression...
5437033 5438785 "The simplest answer<br />is often the correct one"?
5439577 5441454 Actually, I've never<br />found that to be true.
5441621 5443414 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
5446084 5447085 Hey.
5456552 5458304 Elvis is in Missouri.
5458471 5460473 Thank God. Come on in.
5460640 5463059 <i>First thing you have to understand about Amy,<br />she loves to teach lessons.</i>
5463643 5465979 - Play God.<br />- Yeah, Old Testament God.
5466145 5467063 Okay. Keep talking.
5467230 5468815 She finds out I've been cheating on her<br />with Andie...
5468982 5470441 decides to teach me a lesson.
5470608 5472402 Fakes her own death, frames me for it.
5472568 5474654 Blood in the house, credit cards,<br />life insurance.
5474821 5475905 She does the treasure hunt.
5476072 5477281 Now, the treasure hunt is critical.
5477448 5480994 She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities.<br />Rubbing my nose in it.
5481160 5483079 And she leaves clue number one<br />for the police...
5483246 5484831 which will lead them<br />back to my office...
5484998 5487417 which is a place<br />where Andie and I would often...
5487583 5488793 And she leaves a pair of red panties.
5488960 5490003 Right. Racy, looks bad.
5490169 5491754 - Clue two.<br />- My father's house.
5491921 5494173 Another place where Andie and I<br />would occasionally have relations.
5494340 5495591 - Clue three?<br />- Woodshed.
5495758 5497135 - Also a location...<br />- Oh, my God.
5497301 5498928 - We had limited options.<br />- A hotel.
5499095 5501472 - Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br />- Put it on Andie's credit card.
5501639 5502849 Andie's statement<br />went right to her parents.
5503016 5505435 Nick, Margo, can we head over<br />to the little brown house?
5505601 5507270 - This leads us to what?<br />- My dad's house.
5507437 5509188 Dad's house is blue.
5510481 5513526 After the divorce,<br />when Dad wasn't coming around...
5513860 5517989 I used to pretend that he was a spy<br />named Mr. Brown, who...
5518156 5521701 for the sake of his children's safety,<br />had to deny their existence.
5521868 5523286 You never told me that.
5523536 5525204 You told her that?
5525371 5527665 We've got incriminating red panties<br />in your office.
5527999 5530376 We've got a Showcase Showdown<br />worth of crap in your woodshed.
5531502 5534714 So, what in God's name<br />is at your father's house, Nick?
5534881 5535840 And be honest.
5536007 5537842 I honestly have no idea.
5545016 5548728 Whatever they found,<br />I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.
5550563 5552815 <i>We got a lot of uncontained issues here.</i>
5553066 5556152 Nick, do you have any idea<br />as to what Andie's mindset is?
5557361 5559030 We haven't communicated since the vigil.
5559197 5560406 Okay. Amy's parents?
5560573 5562033 - No, it's...<br />- More pressure.
5562200 5565328 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will<br />no doubt go public at any moment.
5565495 5566871 - No, Andie won't do that.<br />- She will.
5567038 5568748 They always do.<br />Don't take it personally.
5569248 5571417 Amy's got us in an interesting bind.
5571751 5573920 - We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br />- Really?
5574087 5576255 Right now,<br />Andie just gives you another motive.
5577090 5578257 We need to tell the cops<br />about the woodshed.
5578549 5579842 We need to be on the front end of that.
5580009 5582345 But I'm gonna warn you<br />as to what will happen.
5582929 5584013 They'll go after Margo.
5584180 5585056 They can't do that, can they?
5585223 5587016 She's your accomplice.<br />She helped you hide the evidence.
5587183 5589268 In all likelihood,<br />she knows that you killed Amy.
5590186 5591604 God.
5591938 5593898 Well, what are we going to do?
5594065 5594941 We find Amy.
5595358 5597568 No. Any other strategy<br />is missing the point.
5597735 5599946 I've got two ex-Secret Service guys<br />that are really good.
5600113 5601614 I'll put them on it.
5601781 5603199 But where do they start, Nick?
5603574 5604700 Where would Amy go?
5606869 5608496 I have no idea.
5612959 5615586 Are we keeping score?
5616254 5617630 Hey!
5619257 5622301 I thought we were steering clear<br />of men for a while.
5622468 5623302 He's nice.
5623469 5625972 Because he wants to fuck you.
5627598 5629142 She's still moping about her ex?
5630935 5633604 He got cheated on, too.
5636983 5639735 We three are the<br />saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.
5639902 5641445 I'm not sad.
5641988 5642822 I'm angry.
5642989 5644657 There you go.
5644824 5647326 I almost drank myself to death<br />when my wife left me.
5647493 5649620 I was gonna kill myself.<br />Can you believe that?
5649787 5650788 Don't give him the pleasure.
5650955 5653958 I was going to drown myself<br />in the Gulf of Mexico...
5654125 5656502 let myself be dinner<br />for the great whites.
5656669 5658337 Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.
5658504 5662300 Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.
5662466 5664927 Please put that on a T-shirt.
5673477 5675855 Miss Moneybags.<br />I thought you said you were broke.
5677356 5678649 That's a fat wad.
5680443 5682111 It's mostly singles.
5682278 5684155 Singles? What are you, a stripper?
5684947 5687533 Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?
5688659 5689702 We're just teasing.
5690494 5692288 Don't they tease people down in NOLA?
5694707 5697543 <i>We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest<br />any day now.</i>
5697710 5701297 <i>We've got blood in the house,<br />huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.</i>
5701464 5705301 <i>And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,<br />missing for five days...</i>
5705468 5707595 <i>crying out for justice.</i>
5708387 5710097 <i>We'll be right back.</i>
5762358 5764819 Tanner has a very bad idea<br />he's going to pitch you.
5764986 5765653 Yeah?
5765820 5767280 You're doing Sharon Schieber<br />tomorrow in St. Louis.
5767446 5768322 It could go so wrong.
5768489 5770116 And you are going<br />to tell her about Andie.
5770283 5771450 Nope.
5771617 5773494 That sounds like a very bad idea.
5773661 5775621 You haven't heard from her<br />in three days.
5775788 5779375 This is a ticking time bomb.<br />You've gotta throw yourself on it.
5779542 5781961 - People are gonna hate me.<br />- And then, they will forgive you.
5782128 5784463 A guy admitting that he's a<br />gigantic asshole on television?
5784630 5786299 People empathize with that.
5787717 5789510 - Why don't we just put out a statement?<br />- They need to see you.
5789677 5792638 Sharon's specials,<br />they get 10 million viewers.
5792805 5795182 She is a crusader.<br />If she takes you on as a cause...
5795349 5797143 She's going to ask real questions.
5797310 5799020 I will drill you<br />as if you were doing a deposition.
5799186 5800521 What to say, what not to say.
5800688 5801689 A trained monkey?
5801856 5803899 A trained monkey<br />who doesn't get the lethal injection.
5805234 5808571 Nick, this case<br />is about what people think of you.
5808738 5810364 They need to like you.
5810531 5814368 Now, you do this and you will reach<br />millions of those people.
5815536 5818039 Maybe I only need to reach one.
5827506 5828174 Hello?
5828341 5829550 Hey, baby.
5831010 5832595 One minute.
5841354 5842688 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
5842855 5843689 You clearing out?
5843856 5845566 No, I'm just cleaning up.
5845733 5847193 Let us come in and say goodbye.
5847360 5848277 I'll come by before...
5848444 5850196 Let us give you a hand.
5856369 5858829 Yeah, you gotta<br />clear everything out, here.
5860498 5863209 Dorothy is a real stickler.
5864543 5867838 Not even a spare hanger<br />can you leave behind.
5870424 5871884 Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.
5874512 5875513 A sock...
5876430 5879225 or undies or what have you.
5884063 5885398 You did a real good job.
5887400 5889527 Where is the money, sweetheart?
5893197 5893948 Look under her dress.
5895741 5896867 He talked you into this?
5897034 5898244 I talked him into it.
5898411 5900413 The second you leave,<br />I'm calling the cops.
5900913 5904458 Your glasses are fake.<br />Your hair's dyed all hamster.
5904625 5907586 You say your name's Nancy,<br />but you don't even answer to it half the time.
5907753 5910089 You're hiding. I don't know why,<br />and I don't really care.
5910256 5912299 But you ain't gonna call the cops.
5912633 5914635 And I don't think you've<br />ever really been hit before.
5920933 5922935 Holy shit.
5925980 5928649 Sorry, but we really need the money.
5928816 5930317 Next place, be more careful, okay?
5930484 5932653 There are a lot of people out there<br />a lot worse than we are.
5967438 5969064 Excuse me. You can't sleep here.
5996675 5999762 I did not kill my wife.
6000763 6003933 Why don't you try it again?<br />A little less wooden.
6004099 6005184 I didn't kill my wife.
6007019 6008604 - What are you doing?<br />- Every time you look smug...
6008771 6011315 or annoyed or tense,<br />I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.
6011482 6013317 - That's supposed to make me less tense?<br />- Let's try it again.
6013484 6016779 Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,<br />you and your wife had some bumps.
6017821 6021659 Yeah, we had some tough years.<br />I lost my job.
6021825 6022826 You both did.
6025538 6027289 We both lost our jobs.
6027456 6029875 I had to move back home<br />so we could take care of my mother...
6030042 6032461 who was dying of cancer<br />and my dad, who had...
6032628 6034255 Your dad's scorched earth.
6034421 6035965 Let's talk about your mom,<br />how close you were.
6036131 6037174 Go on.
6037341 6039718 For a while,<br />things had been building up.
6039885 6043264 "Built up" implies that an explosion<br />is coming. No.
6043430 6045849 At a certain point,<br />we got on the wrong track.
6046684 6048185 I had a moment of weakness.
6048352 6050771 Your "moment" was over 15 months.
6054567 6056652 I disrespected my wife.
6057319 6059738 And I disrespected my marriage.
6060197 6061574 And I'll always regret it.
6062324 6063033 That works.
6063200 6065494 Don't be afraid to play up<br />the dufus husband thing, Nick.
6065661 6067246 "I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.
6067413 6068122 "Everything I do is wrong."
6068289 6070332 I know.<br />What men are supposed to do in general.
6072459 6073377 - Thank you.<br />- How do you feel?
6073544 6076755 I feel good.<br />Go, can you pass me that box, please?
6077172 6079675 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present<br />to me.
6079842 6080718 You hate that watch.
6080884 6082845 No, Go. I love that watch.
6083012 6084888 Just like I love this tie.
6085055 6088183 Just like I love my wife.
6118547 6119798 It's you!
6119965 6121967 It's you.
6122801 6124803 I'm sorry.
6125471 6126805 I'm sorry.
6127723 6129600 Good God.
6129767 6131143 Last week...
6131644 6136815 I threatened to leave, and he said<br />he'd find me and he'd kill me.
6137149 6139318 So, I disappeared.
6140486 6142321 I lost the baby.
6142821 6144490 I couldn't even tell my parents.
6144657 6148577 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.
6149328 6150496 Well, he is looking for you.
6151163 6152998 He showed up on my doorstep<br />three days ago.
6153165 6155668 He tracked me from my letters to you.
6156794 6158003 You saved them.
6158587 6159505 Knowing you were out there...
6159672 6162174 was the only thing that's kept me going<br />these past few years.
6162341 6163592 Let's go to the police.<br />You can explain everything.
6163759 6164927 No, I can't turn up now.
6165094 6168180 I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.
6170015 6172184 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?
6172351 6174186 He should go to prison<br />for what he's done.
6177022 6179358 I'm setting you up at my lake house.
6179525 6180526 It's utterly secluded.
6181944 6183654 Why are you so good to me?
6183821 6185030 You know why.
6185197 6186198 Excuse me.
6186365 6187366 I know you, don't I?
6187533 6188200 No.
6188367 6190202 You're one of the Nolan girls, right?
6190369 6193122 No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.
6193288 6194039 We should leave.
6194206 6195290 Just a second.
6195874 6199002 That was Boney. I'll call her later.
6199169 6201046 Tanner. Nice to see you.
6201338 6202339 Sharon! Hi.
6202506 6204049 Hope this is worth my while.
6204216 6205342 You're gonna be very happy.
6205801 6206468 Sharon.
6206635 6208721 Ms. Schieber.<br />Thank you so much for doing this.
6208887 6210889 Can I get you anything to drink or eat<br />before we get started?
6211056 6213058 No, I had some gummy bears.
6214143 6215728 What the fuck?
6216895 6218021 I'm sorry?
6218439 6222192 <i>We have a major shocking development<br />in the Amazing Amy disappearance.</i>
6222359 6223610 <i>We go live to that story now.</i>
6223777 6225070 Oh, my God.
6227239 6228907 You little slut.
6229074 6232077 <i>My name is Andie Fitzgerald.</i>
6233078 6234621 <i>I met Nicholas Dunne...</i>
6234788 6238292 <i>when he was my creative writing teacher<br />at Mill Valley.</i>
6238459 6240419 Why is she dressed like a babysitter?
6240586 6241920 <i>I am deeply ashamed...</i>
6242087 6245090 <i>of having been romantically involved<br />with a married man.</i>
6245257 6247050 The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.
6247217 6249094 <i>I truly believed we were in love.</i>
6249261 6251096 Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite.
6252598 6253932 <i>I know that is no excuse.</i>
6254099 6255267 No, it is not.
6255434 6259646 <i>I do not, in my heart, believe<br />Nick Dunne would have killed for me.</i>
6259813 6262107 <i>My prayers go out to everyone<br />who loves Amy.</i>
6262274 6265277 <i>I apologize for the pain<br />this has caused them.</i>
6270491 6272451 <i>We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.</i>
6273285 6274661 <i>That love ended today.</i>
6274953 6276455 Come on, you're staring at ghosts.
6276622 6279291 <i>He met our trust with lie after lie.</i>
6279625 6281418 <i>We now absolutely believe...</i>
6281585 6283837 <i>Nick is involved in the disappearance<br />of our daughter.</i>
6284004 6286256 <i>Our Amazing Amy.</i>
6287132 6289259 This just got very exciting.
6289968 6291678 We need a moment.
6293680 6295307 We're gonna have to bow out of this.
6295474 6297142 - Nothing has changed.<br />- Everything has changed.
6297309 6299603 An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?
6299770 6301271 - I can handle this.<br />- We're on the defense.
6301438 6303357 This is a completely different dynamic.
6303524 6306276 - I can handle it.<br />- She's going to eat you alive.
6306819 6308487 Just trust me.
6312866 6314117 Okay.
6314284 6315369 Great.
6316203 6317663 Mic him.
6337391 6339184 One, two, three, four, five.
6345524 6346191 Thank you.
6347693 6348861 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.
6349027 6350028 Yeah, no kidding.
6354700 6357703 Roll tape. Five... four...
6357870 6359496 three... two...
6361707 6364501 Seriously, I can't believe<br />how fucking good you were.
6364668 6366003 - Amy brings out the best in me.<br />- Don't.
6366169 6369214 Keep it together, you two.<br />At least for the next 24 hours.
6369381 6371675 People still hate you.<br />Women want to scratch your eyes out.
6371842 6373594 Andie was really good TV.
6373760 6375679 - She's a good person.<br />- Therein lies the problem.
6375846 6376722 Ride this out...
6376889 6379766 and when Sharon airs tomorrow,<br />we'll be looking at a whole new you.
6379933 6381393 But, until then...
6381560 6383395 don't show your face.
6383562 6385397 No problem.
6401705 6403081 Welcome.
6405083 6406793 Make yourself at home.
6406960 6410797 I've got music, satellite...
6410964 6411798 Netflix.
6411965 6412925 <i>He was her teacher!</i>
6413091 6413884 Roku.
6414635 6417137 Internet, obviously.
6417721 6420307 <i>Here is a supposedly grown man...</i>
6420474 6424144 If there is ever anything you have<br />a taste for and you can't find it...
6424311 6426438 just let me know<br />and I will get it for you.
6426605 6429608 <i>Instead of the A-B-C's,<br />he taught her the birds and the bees.</i>
6429775 6432569 <i>And just think how her mother must feel<br />at a time like this.</i>
6432736 6434738 Wine cellar's downstairs.
6438200 6439451 I'll get you some clothes, too.
6439618 6443038 Not that I don't appreciate<br />Bait Shop Chic.
6444206 6446583 The floors are heated,<br />just dial to your liking.
6446750 6449795 There's robes and towels.<br />The shower has steam.
6449962 6452297 The bathtub has a massage cycle.
6454132 6456051 There's a great view,<br />if you're in the mood.
6456218 6457636 Blackout curtains if you're not.
6457803 6460138 The bed is Savoir.
6460305 6462557 You'll never get a better sleep.
6466436 6468772 This is just what I need.
6470232 6472150 I'm so exhausted.
6473652 6475821 I'll leave you to it, then.
6477572 6480325 Amy, I am so happy that you are here.
6481326 6484329 And I don't want you to worry<br />for one moment.
6484496 6486331 There are cameras everywhere.
6486498 6489251 The exterior, all along the grounds,<br />the entryway.
6489418 6490085 Anyone...
6490585 6492838 who is caught coming or going...
6496091 6497676 will be recorded.
6499261 6501972 You are more than safe.
6503932 6507436 And I am not letting you get away again.
6553190 6554775 - Good morning!<br />- Don't do that!
6556526 6557652 I'm sorry.
6559654 6561156 I need to feel safe.
6561490 6564493 You are very safe.
6566703 6568205 - What have you been up to?<br />- Nothing.
6568371 6570957 Amy, I'm not Nick.
6571124 6573126 It's hard for me.
6576046 6579674 After so many years<br />under someone's thumb...
6581927 6583220 I know just what that feels like.
6584137 6586139 You were never under my thumb.
6586723 6588642 - On your leash.<br />- Never.
6588809 6590310 A new start.
6591603 6593230 Decent clothes.
6594147 6596399 Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.
6596691 6598193 There's a gym overlooking the lake.
6598568 6601988 The sooner you look like yourself,<br />the sooner you'll feel like yourself.
6602155 6605158 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br />Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.
6605325 6607869 I think that's something<br />I should watch on my own.
6608286 6609996 Nonsense.
6613625 6615043 I'll be back.
6616670 6618713 And I am looking forward...
6618880 6621800 to my reunion with Amy Elliott.
6644990 6646158 Great.
6647200 6649161 <i>Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.</i>
6649327 6650954 <i>- Tonight, exclusively...</i><br />- Hurry up.
6651872 6656126 <i>A husband breaks his silence,<br />not just on his wife's disappearance...</i>

6667679 6670140 <i>I probably am.<br />And I probably deserve it.</i>
6670307 6671766 I bought that tie.
6671933 6673852 <i>Did you kill your wife, Nick?</i>
6674019 6677105 <i>I did not kill my wife.</i>
6677772 6679191 <i>I am not a murderer.</i>
6679357 6681151 <i>But you were unfaithful.</i>
6681318 6683403 <i>I was unfaithful.</i>
6683570 6685113 <i>And I am deeply ashamed.</i>
6685280 6687616 <i>And, on top of that,<br />you allowed Amy's parents...</i>

6690702 6695498 <i>believe you were a loving husband,<br />desperate to find his missing wife.</i>
6695665 6697417 <i>Well, I am desperate<br />to find my missing wife.</i>
6697584 6700462 <i>You say that, but I'm wondering<br />how you expect us to believe you...</i>
6700629 6702339 <i>now that we know you're a liar.</i>
6702631 6705634 <i>I didn't come forward with my affair...</i>
6705800 6708970 <i>because I knew it would make me look<br />really, really bad.</i>

6715894 6720190 <i>Just because I am not a murderer<br />doesn't make me a good guy.</i>
6720357 6721524 <i>I'm not a good guy.</i>
6721942 6724402 <i>I was a bad husband to a great wife.</i>
6724778 6726529 <i>I broke the vow that I made to her.</i>
6726780 6729324 <i>Those are pretty words, Nick.</i>
6729658 6731284 <i>But what does that really mean to you?</i>
6731451 6733495 <i>It basically means<br />that I was a con artist.</i>
6734454 6737540 <i>I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.</i>
6737707 6739292 <i>I was completely transfixed.</i>
6739751 6741544 <i>Amy can do that to you.</i>
6741711 6744130 <i>I was this average guy<br />from an average place...</i>
6744297 6746174 <i>with mediocre aspirations.</i>
6746341 6748718 <i>And I met a woman who dazzled me.</i>
6748885 6750720 <i>And I wanted her to love me...</i>
6750887 6753223 <i>so I pretended to be better than I was.</i>
6754099 6757644 <i>When we got married,<br />I promised to be that guy.</i>
6757811 6759521 <i>That guy who works harder.</i>
6759688 6761773 <i>That guy who, who lives and acts...</i>
6761940 6764859 <i>and loves with as much passion<br />as she does.</i>
6765110 6766319 <i>But I failed her.</i>
6767237 6768363 <i>Instead of doing what was right...</i>
6769864 6771032 <i>I did what was easy.</i>
6771783 6775287 <i>You talk like a man who believes<br />he can make amends to his wife.</i>

6777122 6778415 <i>She is still alive.</i>
6780292 6783128 <i>Will you look at that camera for me?</i>
6783461 6786298 <i>Will you look in the lens...</i>
6786464 6788300 <i>and talk to your wife?</i>
6788466 6791428 <i>If she is out there,<br />able to hear and see you tonight...</i>
6791594 6794264 <i>what would you like to say to her, Nick?</i>
6797809 6800103 <i>Amy, I love you.</i>
6800812 6803481 <i>You're the best person I've ever known.</i>
6803648 6807986 <i>And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br />for the way that I've treated you.</i>

6836639 6838683 What does it say?
6838850 6840268 <i>...I think we can all agree...</i>
6840435 6841811 Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.
6841978 6843021 <i>...there's more to him<br />than meets the eye.</i>
6843188 6844147 They're going crazy for you.
6844314 6848693 They disliked me, they liked me,<br />they hated me.
6848860 6850362 And now they love me.
6850528 6853365 <i>...a candor and an honesty<br />that's worthy of respect.</i>
6853531 6855450 <i>He's certainly earned mine.</i>
6856284 6857369 What is it?
6860205 6863375 <i>I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.</i>
6868296 6870965 Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant<br />for your property.
6871132 6873218 I usually ignore tipline calls...
6873385 6877972 but a neighbor was concerned about<br />a strange man around your woodshed.
6878390 6879224 Call Tanner.
6879391 6880558 Okay. Fuck!
6884687 6886147 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.
6887399 6888233 Is that what this is about?
6889901 6894531 I have treated you more than fair<br />throughout this entire investigation.
6894697 6896866 I gave you the benefit of the doubt<br />over and over.
6897033 6898410 Every time you said something stupid...
6898576 6900829 I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."
6900995 6903415 But I was wrong.<br />That's what this is about.
6903581 6904582 Are these the clubs<br />you don't play golf with?
6904749 6905542 None of that is mine.
6906042 6907502 None of this was put here by me.
6907669 6911089 Those are nice clubs.<br />You got the makings of a real man cave.
6911256 6914259 Everything just waiting<br />until the wife goes away for good.
6914426 6915510 Nick!
6916761 6919681 - You can't do that!<br />- Of course we can.
6927981 6930442 Amy, it's time to move on.
6930608 6932318 What can I do to help?
6933027 6934446 I need some time to think.
6934612 6936990 - That's the last thing you need.<br />- Desi...
6937157 6939617 Twenty years,<br />you have kept me dangling.
6939784 6943455 Finally, last night, you came to me,<br />and you chose me.
6944164 6945373 Follow that instinct.
6945540 6947959 Don't trust the instinct<br />that left you beaten and homeless...
6948501 6951671 sleeping in your car,<br />fearing for your life.
6955008 6957719 I'm not gonna force myself on you.
6960138 6962807 I understand what you're saying, Desi.
6964058 6965685 I do.
6969022 6971024 I've been so mistreated for so long.
6973693 6976571 I've forgotten how to behave.
6982327 6984496 I'll move in here tomorrow...
6984662 6987248 and we'll work it out together.
6989334 6993046 I just want you to be you again.
7000887 7002263 <i>They only took Margo to fuck with you.</i>
7002430 7004015 She's not spending<br />another fucking second in there.
7004182 7006935 I'm gonna go in,<br />and I'm gonna tell them everything.
7007602 7009354 What?
7011356 7012857 We tell Boney very little.
7013024 7015026 Without a body,<br />without a murder weapon...
7015193 7017362 their only hope is a confession.
7017529 7019364 So, you let them do all the talking.
7019531 7021533 That way,<br />we can jump-start your defense.
7021699 7024077 The truth is my defense.
7030041 7030875 Recognize these?
7031042 7033044 Yes.<br />It's Amy's anniversary present to me.
7033211 7034879 Was that how she told you<br />she was pregnant, Nick?
7035046 7037549 Mommy, Daddy, baby,<br />and that made you real mad?
7038049 7039217 No.
7040468 7042220 - Recognize this?<br />- Never seen that before in my life.
7042804 7046057 It's Amy's diary.<br />We found this at your father's house.
7048059 7049227 Is this your wife's handwriting?
7049394 7051271 - He's not a handwriting ex...<br />- Looks like it.
7051437 7052564 Our experts thought so, too.
7053898 7055608 Do you wanna<br />play a little true or false?
7056359 7057443 Sure.
7057610 7062073 "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips<br />so he can taste me."
7063199 7065201 Yeah, that's true.
7066452 7068454 You thought quinoa was a fish?
7069747 7071082 That is also true, yes.
7073251 7075253 She wanted to get pregnant,<br />you assaulted her.
7075420 7077297 I hit her? No, never happened.
7077463 7078965 - "Pushed", it says "pushed".<br />- Absolutely not.
7079132 7080216 I never touched her.
7082635 7084262 She tried to buy a gun.
7084929 7086806 I doubt that, but I don't know.
7088224 7089726 Shall I read the last entry?
7089892 7090935 Sure.
7092228 7094230 "This man may kill me."
7094397 7096482 In her own words,<br />"This man may kill me."
7096649 7098776 It's kind of a convenient end note.
7105283 7106576 For future reference...
7106743 7108953 the truth,<br />you are not a handwriting expert.
7109120 7110163 Okay, I know.
7118588 7120423 Judy's missing handle.
7121966 7124135 Big as a two-by-four, right?<br />Big as a club.
7124302 7126929 We found this day one,<br />in the fireplace in your home office.
7127096 7129641 We didn't know what the hell it was,<br />but fire in July?
7129807 7130516 We bagged it.
7130683 7131684 I've never seen that before either.
7131851 7134354 We just tested it.<br />Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.
7134520 7136606 So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...
7136773 7138274 you're under arrest<br />for the murder of your wife.
7138441 7139525 Do not say another word.
7139692 7141027 - What about my side?<br />- Nick!
7154374 7155708 More coffee?
7155875 7157669 I'd love it.
7159962 7163466 Remember that time we skipped school<br />and drove to the Cape?
7163633 7166052 God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.
7166219 7167845 This reminds me of that.
7168346 7170014 Never-ending holiday.
7171557 7173643 You're not bored?
7173810 7175186 Desi, how could I be bored?
7175353 7177689 You can discuss<br />18th-century symphonies...
7177855 7180775 19th-century Impressionists,<br />quote Proust in French.
7181150 7185154 Nick's idea of culture<br />was a reality TV marathon...
7185321 7187198 with one hand down his boxers.
7189200 7190785 I really have to get going.
7191119 7194455 But I will be back<br />just as soon as I can.
7201045 7202130 My keys.
7207343 7209345 Thank you.
7220565 7222150 That's how the kids wear it.
7282960 7286798 Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.
7289634 7290802 Hey.
7291219 7293471 - Are you okay?<br />- Yes. Are you?
7293638 7294764 Yeah.
7294931 7296808 Let's go.
7298643 7299727 What does this mean?
7299894 7301938 Well, you're out on bond.
7302104 7305316 You can relax at home<br />while we prep for trial.
7310822 7312824 Keep your head down.
7328256 7330508 Tanner, is there<br />any fucking lead on Amy?
7330675 7332677 I've got two of my best guys on it.
7333177 7334804 She's air.
7336848 7339809 Come home, Amy. I dare you.
7397033 7399452 Mr. Collings is home.
7399619 7401871 Hello, Mr. Collings.
7402038 7403789 I've missed you.
7403956 7405583 I've been thinking...
7406042 7408210 I don't wanna be without you.
7408920 7411130 Stay with me.
7411297 7414133 And when all this dies down,<br />we'll go to Greece, like you said.
7414300 7416594 Octopus and Scrabble?
7418596 7420723 How long do you think until it's done?
7420890 7424477 Not long. Six months for the trial.<br />Sentencing will be quick.
7424977 7425937 He'll appeal.
7426103 7428230 I can watch the rest overseas.
7445623 7446791 Go slowly.
7446958 7447833 But I want it.
7468312 7469772 Don't rush.
7469939 7472024 Just do it.
7480491 7482034 Harder.
7580591 7583761 You fucking bitch.
7592436 7596107 Don't you worry,<br />you're gonna have lots of babies.
7597733 7601112 Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br />There was semen present.
7601278 7602279 We'll make sure it's a match.
7602446 7604073 Yeah, it'll match.
7604240 7606575 Thank you very much.
7606742 7608119 What do you think?
7608285 7609453 Are we pals again?
7609620 7613040 Now that I know<br />you didn't murder your wife, yes.
7613207 7614041 What do you think?
7614208 7617128 Kidnapping? The story's insane.
7619296 7621632 She's on fairly heavy painkillers.
7621799 7623592 It's okay. I want to help.
7623759 7625052 Ms. Dunne, I know<br />what you've been through...
7625219 7627429 so we'll keep this very brief.
7627596 7629974 Can you walk us through what happened?
7632601 7635229 That morning, the doorbell rang.
7636105 7637982 So normal.
7638149 7639984 I opened the door.
7640609 7642444 So strange.
7643070 7646574 Since high school,<br />he won't ever go away.
7646740 7649702 And I've just tried to be nice to him.
7649869 7651495 Answer his letters.
7651745 7653747 Keep him calm.
7655166 7656625 Oh, my God.
7657251 7658752 I've encouraged him.
7658919 7660713 You can't blame yourself.
7662339 7664508 He pushed inside.
7666093 7668137 And he grabbed me.
7668846 7671932 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.
7672266 7673976 And he clubbed me.
7674435 7675728 I collapsed.
7675895 7679815 That club was actually the handle<br />to a Punch and Judy puppet.
7679982 7681400 Right.
7682318 7683736 Treasure hunt.
7685654 7687573 I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...
7687740 7689450 Then how did Desi have that handle?
7691327 7693245 I'd just found it.
7693996 7696415 It must have fallen off.
7698334 7701879 I was holding it when Desi pushed in.<br />So, he got it from me.
7702046 7703130 About that woodshed...
7703297 7704965 He took me to his lake house.
7705549 7707134 Tied me to his bed.
7707301 7709720 Back to the woodshed real quick.<br />Real quick.
7709887 7711597 When you went<br />to place the puppets there...
7711764 7713015 did you notice that it was packed...
7713182 7714225 Lots of stuff.
7714391 7718687 Corresponding to purchases made<br />on credit cards in your husband's name.
7718854 7720231 Nick and credit cards.
7720397 7722816 He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.
7722983 7725778 He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.<br />They're very close.
7726320 7730532 Now, may I go back<br />to where I was being held prisoner...
7730699 7733327 by a man with a history<br />of mental problems?
7733494 7734370 Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
7738874 7740960 Desi assaulted me that night.
7741919 7743754 Every night.
7744880 7747299 He tied me up like a dog.
7748676 7751178 And then, he'd punish me.
7753097 7755140 Starve me.
7756433 7758352 Shave me.
7759979 7761939 Sodomize me.
7762731 7764441 There were cameras everywhere.
7764608 7767569 Please find this. Please find the tapes.
7769238 7772449 She slit his throat with a box cutter.
7773534 7775619 How did she manage<br />to get a hold of a box cutter...
7775786 7778372 if he had her tied up the whole time?
7779331 7781375 Can't you just be happy<br />your wife is home and safe?
7782167 7784003 Amy, we found your diary.
7784169 7788132 It contains many concerning allegations<br />of mental and physical abuse.
7788299 7791176 Well, it's the ugly truth.
7792011 7793512 Nick didn't want a baby.
7795347 7798642 He has a temper. We had money problems.
7799560 7800561 But I love him.
7800728 7802479 Then why did you try to buy a gun?
7804440 7806400 I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.
7806567 7808277 If I could just clarify one thing...
7808444 7811530 If this case had been left<br />in your deeply incompetent hands...
7811697 7813574 my husband would be on death row...
7813866 7817619 and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...
7817911 7821582 Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.<br />We're finished.
7822458 7824501 Now, I have to ask you...
7824668 7827504 do you feel safe<br />going home with your husband?
7839933 7842436 We prayed to God,<br />and God has answered our prayers.
7842603 7843854 Amy Dunne is home.
7844021 7845981 Now, I know there are<br />a lot of questions and concerns...
7846148 7848025 but for right now, we wanna sit tight...
7848192 7853113 and just be thankful and grateful<br />for this miracle on the Mississippi.
7860579 7862373 Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.
7914133 7915342 We love you, Amy!
7919972 7921682 All right, you can stop pretending now.
7921849 7923517 I'm not pretending.
7924226 7925936 You were perfect.
7926562 7928981 The Nick I saw on TV,<br />that's the Nick I fell in love with.
7929148 7931733 You do know I was just telling you<br />what you wanted to hear, right?
7931900 7933610 That's how well you know me.
7933777 7936405 You know me in your marrow.
7937406 7938866 Okay.
7939032 7942369 You need to tell me<br />exactly what happened.
7943662 7944913 Take off your clothes.
7945414 7948625 I need to make sure<br />you're not wearing a wire.
7961930 7965809 You killed someone, Amy.<br />You're a murderer.
7965976 7967436 I'm a fighter.
7967603 7969938 I fought my way back to you.
7970105 7971773 You killed a guy.
7971982 7973817 You slashed his throat<br />with a box cutter.
7973984 7978655 You went on national television<br />and begged for me to save your life.
7979239 7980365 And I obliged.
7980532 7981992 But I want that Nick.
7982326 7983619 I'm leaving.
7983785 7986413 You really think that's smart?
7987080 7988040 Shampoo.
7990792 7994588 Wounded, raped wife battles her way<br />back to her husband...
7994755 7996507 and he deserts her.
7996673 7997716 They'll destroy you.
7998467 7999843 Neighbors will shun you.
8000010 8004223 And I'll make sure that no one forgets<br />the pain you caused me.
8006308 8011396 I don't want anything to do<br />with your groupies outside.
8011980 8013607 Once they go...
8014483 8015275 I go.
8015442 8018862 Give it the night. Sleep on it.
8035712 8037297 Was there ever a baby?
8037589 8039675 There can be.
8043679 8044680 Good night.
8097608 8099276 Hey, Nick!
8111413 8112664 Hello, handsome.
8115792 8117544 Crepe?
8118253 8119046 Sure.
8119212 8120797 <i>She was his dream girl.</i>
8120964 8124259 <i>And when this spoiled, rich,<br />entitled little boy couldn't have her...</i>
8124426 8125802 <i>he took her.</i>
8133185 8134519 You must be so proud.
8141777 8143779 It's been four hours.
8144279 8147115 Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?
8151286 8154122 Right now, it's all about our marriage.
8154956 8158335 When two people love each other<br />and can't make that work...
8158502 8160921 that's the real tragedy.
8164675 8166718 Kiss my cheek.
8173058 8175811 I can't believe that fucking spider<br />is America's sweetheart.
8175894 8177979 She told me she killed Desi.
8178146 8179356 Not self-defense. Murder.
8179523 8180941 - Can't we get a wire?<br />- That's not gonna work.
8181108 8182150 She told you once before.
8182317 8184528 Yeah, because she had me strip naked,<br />and stand in the shower.
8184695 8187823 I swear, you two are the most<br />fucked-up people I've ever known.
8187989 8189449 And I specialize in fucked-up.
8189700 8191410 You and Amy under the same roof?
8191576 8193370 You should pitch that<br />as reality television.
8193995 8196248 <i>Amy Dunne,<br />and the Miracle on the Mississippi.</i>
8196415 8198792 <i>Nick and I have been through<br />some bad patches.</i>
8198959 8200168 <i>We've had our dark days.</i>
8200335 8202170 <i>But we thank you so much...</i>
8202671 8207217 <i>for supporting us in our new life together,<br />for forgiving Nick.</i>
8207467 8211054 <i>Really, your encouragement<br />means the world.</i>
8211221 8212514 She's good.

8217436 8218395 Take care of this guy, will you?
8218562 8219938 I can't believe you're just leaving now.
8220188 8221606 You are not at risk anymore.
8221773 8223150 I'm the definition of "at risk."
8223358 8227362 You got a book deal, a Lifetime movie,<br />you franchised The Bar.
8227529 8228572 You may wanna thank her.
8231616 8233034 Just don't piss her off.
8233869 8234619 See you, guys.
8236997 8238540 Elvis has left Missouri.
8238707 8239666 She had to have made a mistake.
8239833 8242002 We need to check Amy's story,<br />piece by piece.
8242169 8244045 Nick, I can't do anything.
8244463 8247174 We had the national spotlight on us,<br />we stained the rug.
8247340 8248925 The case is with the Feds now,<br />they're done.
8249092 8250135 That doesn't mean you have to be done.
8250552 8252345 It does.
8283919 8285378 What are you doing?
8287297 8288757 Couldn't sleep.
8288924 8289591 Come on...
8290217 8292385 let me tuck you back in.
8305065 8307692 You know you can sleep with me, right?
8309778 8311738 Yeah, it's just...
8311905 8313240 I need more time.
8313448 8316993 I would never, ever hurt you.
8318787 8321122 I do need you to participate, though.
8321289 8323458 I need you to do your part.
8333760 8334511 Okay.
8335512 8338306 Everything you have heard<br />about my wife...
8338390 8339641 is a lie.
8339808 8343895 She is a calculating,<br />murderous psychopath.
8344521 8345939 And I have been complicit...
8346106 8347232 Nick!
8352904 8354948 Nick? Breakfast.
8355115 8355949 Honey?
8359661 8361997 We should hold hands.
8362163 8365250 Not the entire time,<br />but on and off throughout.
8366668 8368879 "So, Nick, how does it feel<br />to have your wife back?"
8371506 8373258 "It's fantastic.
8373425 8376344 "How many people are lucky enough<br />to get a second chance at love?"
8376511 8378221 "Fantastic" is a little flippant.
8378638 8379639 "Amazing"?
8379806 8382517 I need you<br />to admit that you got the credit cards...
8382684 8385687 and that you hid all that stuff at Go's<br />and that you pushed me.
8386438 8389482 I'm gonna need<br />those three things to feel safe.
8390692 8392527 You have to own this, Nick.
8393320 8396865 Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.
8398450 8400201 Nick.
8403163 8405790 What a beautiful home.
8407042 8409586 I so appreciate<br />you giving us this time, Nick.
8409753 8411796 You went on national television...
8411963 8414299 and told people that I murdered my wife.
8414466 8415592 I go where the story goes.
8415759 8418595 You implied that I had carnal relations<br />with my sister.
8418762 8422182 I didn't use the "I" word.<br />I said you two were "extremely close."
8422349 8427020 You and a panel of nitwits<br />diagnosed me as a sociopath.
8428229 8429981 Ice-breaker.
8433693 8435362 To go with your robot dog.
8435528 8437572 I'll go find Amy.
8439616 8441701 She's downstairs.
8444204 8445705 - What is it?<br />- It's for you.
8445872 8447290 Open it.
8447582 8449209 I don't need any more gifts from you.
8449376 8451086 Open it.
8463640 8465183 I didn't touch you.
8465350 8466267 You didn't need to.
8466434 8469521 Bullshit. That notice of disposal.
8469688 8471064 I have that. You threw it out.
8471231 8473066 The notice, yes.
8473441 8474317 I want a blood test.
8474859 8475944 I want a paternity test.
8476736 8477946 I love tests.
8478113 8479823 You can teach those people<br />to hate me all you want.
8479990 8482701 I don't care. I am leaving you.
8484828 8487414 I won't have to teach your child<br />to hate you.
8487580 8489833 He'll do that all by himself.
8490000 8491876 You fucking cunt!
8493753 8496006 I'm the cunt you married.
8496172 8497841 The only time you liked yourself...
8498008 8501553 was when you were trying to be someone<br />this cunt might like.
8501720 8505181 I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.
8508935 8512188 I've killed for you.<br />Who else can say that?
8513440 8515859 You think you would be happy<br />with a nice Midwestern girl?
8516026 8518737 No way, baby. I'm it.
8518903 8522198 Look, you're delusional. You're insane.
8522365 8523867 Why would you even want this?
8524242 8525201 Yes, I loved you.
8525368 8528705 And then all we did was resent each other,<br />and try to control each other.
8528872 8529873 And cause each other pain.
8530415 8532208 That's marriage.
8534878 8537255 Now, I'm getting ready.
8562572 8565533 <i>I can't watch you play house<br />with that thing for the next 18 years.</i>
8565700 8567243 I can't just walk away.
8567410 8568870 You could get custody.
8569037 8572791 No, I won't. And you know it.
8572957 8575460 It's gonna be my child.<br />I'm not gonna leave it.
8576086 8577754 You wanna stay.
8577921 8581716 I have a responsibility.<br />It's not about what I want anymore.
8581883 8583134 You wanna stay with her.
8593770 8594813 You're breaking my heart.
8595271 8598775 Go, you're my voice of reason.
8598942 8601319 I need you with me on this.
8601486 8603947 Of course I'm with you.
8606574 8610578 I was with you before we were even born.
8612330 8615125 We've been through the darkness.
8615667 8618962 We've come out, united.
8621965 8624134 We communicate.
8626427 8628805 We're honest with each other.
8628972 8630473 Right?
8632392 8634894 We're partners in crime.
8638273 8639107 And?
8640984 8642318 And?
8645822 8647740 We're gonna be parents.
8649450 8651077 My goodness!
8651494 8653454 - How exciting!<br />- Thank you.
