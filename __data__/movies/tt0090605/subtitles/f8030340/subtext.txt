308334 312193 <i>Bio readouts are all in the<br />green. Looks like she's alive.</i>
315375 317924 Well, there goes our salvage, guys.
344791 348047 - How are we today?<br />- Ohh. Terrible.
348200 350643 Well, better than yesterday, at least.
350958 353295 - Where am I?<br />- You're safe.
353791 355845 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
356292 359195 You were pretty groggy at<br />first, but now you're okay.
359791 361916 Oh, looks like you've got a visitor.
364167 366148 Jonesy. Come here.
367666 369471 Hey, come here.
369875 372093 How are you, you stupid cat?
372334 375762 How are you? Where have you been?
376334 379591 Guess you two have met,<br />huh? I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
380250 385250 I work for the company, but don't let<br />that fool you. I'm really an okay guy.
386083 387712 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
388083 391093 They tell me that all the weakness<br />and disorientation should pass soon.
391750 396743 That's just natural side effects of such an<br />unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.
397708 399549 What do you mean?
399958 401977 How long was I out there?
402416 404186 <i>Inhalation Therapy, report to...</i>
404583 406495 Has no one discussed this with you yet?
406917 408616 No. But, I mean...
409000 412399 I don't... recognize this place.
413083 414782 No, I know. Uh...
415167 418318 Okay. It's just that, uh,<br />this might be a shock to you.
419000 421195 - It's long--<br />- How long?
421666 423365 Please.
424666 428030 - 57 years.<br />- What?
428708 432320 That's the thing. You<br />were out there for 57 years.
433042 435697 What happened was you had<br />drifted right through the core systems.
436250 438657 And it's really just blind luck...
439167 441893 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
442458 444405 It's one in a thousand, really.
444833 448834 I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.<br />You could be floating out there forever.
449625 452351 You--you okay?
452917 455324 Uhh--
459250 461587 Uuh!
462083 463996 You okay?
468875 472947 Oh-h-h! Oh, God!
475083 478093 - Nurse! Please!<br />- God!
478750 481263 Someone get in here now!
481791 483526 Now!
483917 485793 - Hold!<br />- Please.
486208 488084 Hold on!
488499 490198 Kill me!
498167 501495 No!
503083 504854 Uh!
507875 510530 Bad dreams again? You want<br />something to help you sleep?
511083 512996 No.
513416 515115 I've slept enough.
517336 519248 Jonesy.
519669 521368 Come here.
521752 523523 Shh.
528128 529827 It's all right.
531128 534350 It's all right now.
535003 536737 It's over.
540128 542040 <i>I'd just like to go, uh...</i>
542460 544301 back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.
544752 547763 <i>Is it in the file? I<br />don't understand this.</i>
548378 550901 We have been here for<br />three and a half hours.
551761 554702 Now, how many different ways do<br />you want me to tell the same story?
555304 559234 Look at it from our perspective, please.
559413 561112 Please?
563829 566118 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
566371 569278 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class starfreighter,
569288 571376 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
571829 574555 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
575121 577457 That's minus payload, of course.
577954 581872 The lifeboat's flight recorder<br />corroborates some elements of your account,
582413 587397 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
587538 592097 an unsurveyed pIanet at that<br />time, that it resumed its course...
592162 597041 and was subsequently set for<br />self-destruct by you for reasons unknown.
597162 599145 Not for reasons unknown. I told you.
599620 604472 We set down there on company orders to<br />get this thing, which destroyed my crew...
605413 607501 and your expensive ship.
607954 611069 The analysis team, which went over<br />the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
611704 614359 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
614512 618347 Good! That's because I blew<br />it out of the goddamn air lock,
620220 621991 like I said.
624654 628949 Are there any species like<br />this hostile organism on LV-426?
629321 631444 No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.
633820 636866 Did I.Q.'s just drop<br />sharply while I was away?
637088 639705 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
639745 642583 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
642779 647374 It was not from there. Do you<br />get it? We homed in on its beacon.
647446 649818 And found something<br />never recorded once...
650321 653294 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
653904 657402 "A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host."
657496 658145 Yes.
658179 662308 These are your words:<br />"And has concentrated acid for blood."
662379 663891 That's right.
664712 668041 Look. I can see where this is going,
668712 671266 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
671354 674544 - Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all.<br />- Please. You're not listening to me.
674604 676728 Kane, the crew member...
677188 680639 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
680921 683255 - Thousands.<br />- Thank you. That will be all.
683346 685381 Goddamn it, that's not all!
685471 688322 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
688362 690922 Then all of this- this bullshit<br />that you think is so important...
691187 694409 You can just kiss all of that good-bye!
710803 712574 That could have been better.
713012 715950 - Look, I think the-- Ripley?<br />- Van Leuwen.
716553 719315 Why don't you just check out LV-426?
719987 723973 Because I don't have to. There have<br />been people there for over 20 years,
724261 726279 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
726382 728545 What do you mean? What people?
729011 731666 Terraformers. Planet engineers.
732020 735871 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
736211 737958 Takes decades.
737987 740099 It's what we call a<br />"Shake 'N Bake" colony.
740920 744400 How many are there? How many colonists?
744428 748752 I don't know... 60, maybe<br />70 families. Do you mind?
751395 753349 "Families."
755845 757799 Jesus.
794236 796394 Hiya, Ripley. This is<br />Lieutenant Gorman...
796528 798982 of the Colonial Marine Corps--
799736 801934 Ripley, we have to talk.
802069 805693 We've lost contact with<br />the colony on LV-426.
812236 814394 I don't believe this.
814570 819008 You guys throw me at the wolves, and<br />now you want me to go back out there?
819194 821718 Forget it. It's not my problem.
821902 825404 - Can I finish?<br />- No. There's no way.
826902 828938 Ripley, you wouldn't be<br />going in with the troops.
829069 831350 I can guarantee your safety.
831486 833929 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough <i>hombres.</i>
834069 836878 They're packing<br />state-of-the-art firepower.
837028 838167 There's nothing they can't handle.
839617 841855 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- That's true.
841992 844109 We've been trained to<br />deal with situations like this.
844242 847784 Then you don't need<br />me. I'm not a soldier.
847992 850517 <i>Yeah, but we don't know<br />exactly what's going on out there.</i>
850659 853183 It may just be a downed<br />transmitter, okay?
853325 857682 But if it's not, I would like<br />you there as an adviser,
857867 859739 and that's all.
859867 862716 Look, I don't have time for this.<br />I've got to get going, go to work.
862867 866161 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
866917 868130 That's right.
868200 870846 - Running loaders and forklifts, that sort of thing?<br />- Yeah. So?
870992 874046 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
874200 876683 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
876825 878617 There's nothing wrong with it.
881911 883814 What would you say if I told<br />you I could get you reinstated...
883853 885566 as a flight officer?
885836 889118 The company's already<br />agreed to pick up your contract.
889694 890871 If I go.
891945 894035 Yeah, if you go.
894319 896436 Come on. That's a second chance, kiddo.
896570 898856 I think, personally, for you, it<br />would be the best thing in the world...
899003 901812 to get out there and face this<br />thing, get back on the horse.
901961 904811 Spare me, Burke. I've had<br />my psych evaluation this month.
905003 909193 Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every<br />night. Your sheets are soaking with sweat--
909270 911568 I said no, and I mean it!
914311 917120 Now, please leave. I am not going back.
917270 920526 And I am-- I would not<br />be any good to you if I did.
920686 923699 Okay. Shh.
924986 928206 Would you do me a<br />favor? Just think about it.
931569 933564 Thanks for the coffee.
953111 955065 Oh!
1001611 1003483 Hello.
1003611 1006258 Ripley.
1006444 1009905 - You okay?<br />- Just tell me one thing, Burke.
1010070 1013287 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1013444 1018250 Not to study, not to bring<br />back, but to wipe them out.
1019244 1022494 That's the plan. You have my word on it.
1025028 1026608 All right. I'm in.
1036453 1038692 And you, you little shithead...
1040028 1041997 you're staying here.
1109204 1110958 Mmm.
1125537 1129284 They ain't payin' us<br />enough for this, man.
1129453 1132370 Not enough to have to<br />wake up to your face, Drake.
1132903 1133955 What?
1134388 1135509 Is that a joke?
1135521 1137457 Oh, I wish it were.
1137488 1142293 Hey, Hicks. Man,<br />you look just like I feel.
1144688 1146375 All right, sweethearts,<br />what are you waiting for...
1146446 1149501 breakfast in bed? Another<br />glorious day in the corps.
1150054 1152874 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm-
1153038 1158283 every meal's a banquet, every paycheck<br />a fortune, every formation a parade.
1158321 1159950 I love the corps! Christ!
1160071 1161862 Man, this floor is freezing!
1162029 1164050 What do you want me to<br />do? Fetch your slippers for ya?
1164197 1166150 Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1166280 1169456 Look into my eye. Fall in, people.
1169812 1172010 Come on. Let's go.
1172146 1173859 I hate this job.
1174029 1176635 Crowe, Wierzbowski. Come on. On your<br />feet. We got some slack coming, right?
1176779 1179588 You had three weeks on your<br />back, Frost. What do you want?
1179737 1182059 <i>I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.</i>
1182196 1184435 <i>Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?</i>
1187612 1191684 <i>All right. First assembly's<br />in 15, people. Shag it.</i>
1193029 1195594 Hey, <i>mira.</i> Who's Snow White?
1195737 1199117 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1199280 1201478 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1201612 1204585 Whoopee-fuckin'-do! Hey, I'm impressed.
1204737 1206532 <i>!Que bonita!</i>
1209113 1213144 Hey, Vasquez. Have you<br />ever been mistaken for a man?
1213321 1215316 No. Have you?
1215446 1217766 Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez.
1219384 1220704 You're just too bad.
1220988 1222657 Uhh!
1231113 1233596 Hey, Top,  what's the op?
1233737 1235813 It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.
1235946 1240547 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1241137 1243054 <i>Dumb-ass colonists.</i>
1246512 1248654 What's this crap supposed to be?
1249238 1252251 Corn bread, I think. It's<br />good for you, boy. Eat it.
1252405 1256137 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting<br />some more of that Arcturian poontang.
1256204 1260812 - Remember that time?<br />- Yeah. Except the one that you had was male.
1260896 1263121 Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.
1263205 1265566 Hey, Bishop, man. Do the<br />thing with the knife. Oh, please.
1265746 1268108 Oh, come on. Yeah.
1268246 1270160 All right! Yeah.
1270288 1273789 - I don't want to see that, man.<br />- Come on, man. All right. All right.
1273954 1276845 Hey, what are you doing,<br />man? What are you doing?
1277038 1279114 - Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />- Hudson, shut up !
1279246 1281770 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- <i>Do it, Bishop!</i>
1281913 1285414 - Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!<br />- Yeah, you! Don't move.
1285979 1287518 Trust me.
1289563 1291436 Aahhhhh!
1301047 1303137 <i>All right. Knock it off, knock it off.</i>
1303221 1304621 Thank you.
1307180 1309034 There you go, short shit.<br />Enjoy your meal.
1309663 1312350 That wasn't funny, man.
1315754 1318808 Lieutenant Gorman?<br />Mr. Burke? Yeah, thanks.
1318962 1324012 Looks like the new lieutenant's too<br />good to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1325546 1328640 Boy's definitely got<br />a corncob up his ass.
1329796 1332443 <i>Thought you never miss, Bishop?</i>
1335596 1338624 You never said anything about an<br />android being on board. Why not?
1339272 1342220 <i>It never... never occurred to me.
1342796 1345809 It's just common practice. We<br />always have a synthetic on board.
1345962 1348365 I prefer the term<br />"artificial person" myself.
1348705 1350237 Right.
1350463 1353068 - Is there a problem?<br />- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
1353213 1355085 I don't know why... I didn't even--
1355213 1358552 Ripley's last trip out, the syn--<br />the artificial person malfunctioned.
1358712 1363477 - Malfunctioned?<br />- There were problems and a few deaths were involved.
1363672 1366806 I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
1366962 1369569 The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1369712 1372237 That explains it then. The<br />A2s always were a bit twitchy.
1372380 1375026 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1375171 1379650 It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission<br />of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.
1380637 1382550 You sure you don't want some?
1384129 1386653 You just stay away from me,<br />Bishop. You got that straight?
1389905 1392461 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1406171 1410202 - <i>Squad, ten-hut! Officer on deck!</i><br />- As you were.
1410180 1412948 Quickly, quickly. Settle down.
1413096 1415728 All right. Listen up!
1416180 1421107 Morning, marines. I'm sorry we didn't have time<br />to brief you people before we left Gateway--
1421346 1423748 - <i>Sir?</i><br />- What is it, Hicks?
1423888 1426901 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
1427054 1429904 What's the question?
1430054 1433760 Is this gonna be a stand-up<br />fight, sir, or another bug hunt?
1434729 1437920 All we know is that there's<br />still no contact with the colony...
1438096 1440864 and that a xenomorph may be involved.
1441054 1443700 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
1443846 1446044 It's a bug hunt.
1446180 1450781 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
1450971 1453333 I'll tell you what I know.
1453472 1455833 We set down on LV-426.
1455971 1459880 One of our crew members was brought back on<br />board with something attached to his face,
1460054 1462497 some kind of parasite.
1462637 1464918 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
1465054 1467904 Later, it seemed to<br />come off by itself and die.
1468054 1470538 Kane seemed fine.
1470679 1472755 We were all having dinner, and, um...
1472888 1476919 it must have laid something inside<br />his throat, some sort of embryo.
1477138 1481006 - He started-- um, he--<br />- <i>Look, man.</i>
1481180 1486107 I only need to know<br />one thing. where they are.
1486346 1489033 - Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1489180 1493903 Right, right. Somebody said "alien." She<br />thought they said "illegal alien" and signed up.
1494138 1496051 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1496180 1498744 Are you finished?
1503971 1507017 I hope you're right. I really do.
1508929 1511902 Yeah, okay, right. Thank you, Ripley.
1512054 1514904 We also have Ripley's report<br />on disk. I suggest you study it.
1515096 1519860 Because just one of those things managed to<br />wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
1520054 1522741 And if the colonists have found<br />that ship, then there's no telling...
1522888 1524516 how many of them have been exposed.
1524637 1526999 Do you understand?
1529604 1532280 Anyway, we have it on<br />disk, so you better look at it.
1532538 1534243 Any questions?
1535688 1537488 What is it, Private?
1537746 1540678 How do I get out of<br />this chickenshit outfit?
1540830 1542540 You secure that shit, Hudson.
1545046 1546881 All right.
1547213 1549981 Now listen up.
1551421 1553497 I want this thing to go smooth...
1553630 1556113 and by the numbers.
1556254 1560572 I want D.C.S. and tactical<br />database assimilation by 0830.
1560796 1563686 Ordinance loading, weapons<br />strip and drop-ship prep details...
1563879 1566200 will have seven hours.<br />- Oh, come on.
1566338 1568455 Now, move it, people!
1568388 1571034 All right, sweethearts. You heard<br />the man, and you know the drill.
1571180 1575592 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
1590596 1592550 I don't care if you are<br />short, Hudson. Get it done.
1592679 1595204 Hey, Sarge. You'll get<br />lip cancer smoking those.
1595346 1598401 Corporal, I want this<br />loading lock sealed. Now!
1598796 1601258 - How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?<br />- Last one.
1601296 1603091 Good. Take it away.
1620754 1622489 Clear behind.
1629004 1631570 Did you check number<br />three? Let me see that.
1631712 1635541 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
1635712 1638034 I don't know. Is there<br />anything you can do?
1641046 1643244 Well, I can drive that loader.
1644180 1646363 I have a Class 2 rating.
1647929 1649965 Be my guest.
1694912 1697241 Where you want it?
1700312 1702392 Bay 12, please.
1758263 1761642 <i>All right, sweethearts. We're a team,<br />and there's nothing to worry about.</i>
1761804 1765725 We come here, and we gonna<br />conquer, and we gonna kick some.
1765800 1767265 - Is that understood?<br />- Yes, Sir.
1767279 1768739 That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
1768788 1771068 We are going to go and get some.
1771304 1773891 All right, people! On the ready line!
1773979 1776667 - Are you lean? Are you mean?<br />- <i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>
1776754 1779320 - What are you? What are you?<br />- <i>Lean and mean!</i>
1779463 1782190 Hudson! Get on the ready line, marine!
1782338 1785187 Get some today! Get on the ready line!
1785380 1788229 Yo! Move it out! Move it out, goddamn it!
1788380 1791880 Get hot! One, two, three!<br />Get out, get out, get out!
1792046 1795507 Move it out, move it out, move it out!<br />Move it out, move it out, move it out!
1799821 1801962 Absolutely badasses.
1802046 1804608 Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!
1804832 1806446 All right! Move it!
1806630 1809235 Let's go, let's go! One, two, three,
1809380 1812758 four, five, six!
1812921 1816697 All right. I want combat<br />seating. You know your places.
1817180 1819419 Get those weapons stowed. Let's go.
1819554 1822412 Come on. Settle down, people.
1824461 1826091 Lock 'em in, Hudson.
1826156 1829353 - Ready to get it on?<br />- You know it!
1829437 1832044 Okay, Bishop, let's go.
1832188 1834004 Roger.
1836146 1838492 I'm ready, man.
1838676 1842495 Ready to get it on! Go!
1846604 1850513 <i>Stand by. Cross-locking now.<br />Prelaunch autocycle engaged.</i>
1853854 1857763 <i>Primary couplers<br />released. Hit the internals.</i>
1869396 1872043 Shit, man. Confirm cross-lock<br />and drop stations secured.
1872188 1876218 <i>Affirmative. All drop stations secured.</i>
1879780 1882263 Stand by. Ten seconds.
1884946 1889096 Stand by to initiate release<br />sequencer... on my mark.
1889272 1893532 - Five... four... three...<br />- We're on an express elevator to hell, going down.
1893821 1896712 two... one... mark.
1897946 1900267 Woo-hoo!
1912571 1916847 - Switch to D.C.S. ranging.<br />- <i>240, nominal to profile.</i>
1917030 1919676 We're in the pipe, five by five.
1930446 1932563 We're picking up some hull ionization.
1932696 1935098 Got it. Rough air ahead.
1935237 1937036 We're in for some chop.
1951112 1953593 How many drops is<br />this for you, Lieutenant?
1955780 1957541 Thirty-eight.
1958479 1959992 Simulated.
1960321 1962397 How many combat drops?
1962529 1966479 Uh, two... including this one.
1966654 1969912 - Shit.<br />- Oh, man!
1982654 1986767 Range 014. Turning on final.
1991738 1994547 <i>And I'm telling you, I got a<br />bad feeling about this drop.</i>
1994696 1998034 <i>You always say that, Frost. You always<br />say, "I got a bad feeling about this drop."
1998196 2000558 <i>Okay, okay. When we get back without you,</i>
2000738 2003070 I'll call your folks.
2005988 2010018 All right. Let's see what we can see.
2010196 2013575 Everybody online. Looking good.
2015488 2017727 Drake, check your camera.<br />There seems to be a malfunction.
2019160 2022418 That's better. Pan it around a bit.
2022577 2026364 - Good.<br />- All right, gear up.
2026535 2030241 Two minutes, people. Get hot.
2030410 2032120 Somebody wake up Hicks.
2045660 2048023 Coming around for a 709er.
2048202 2051012 - Terminal guidance locked in.<br />- Where's the damn beacon?
2051160 2053603 Oh, I see it.
2059686 2063042 - That's the atmosphere processor?<br />- Yep, that's it.
2063202 2066319 Remarkable piece of<br />machinery. Completely automated.
2066377 2068821 You know, we manufacture<br />those, by the way.
2078544 2083594 <i>Okay, Ferro. Take us in low<br />over the main colony complex.</i>
2085419 2087495 Storm shutters are sealed.
2087627 2091510 - There's no visible activity.<br />- All right. Hold at 40.
2091591 2094659 <i>Roger. Give me a slow<br />circle of the complex.</i>
2102299 2106935 Structure seems intact.<br />They still have power.
2107116 2111128 Okay, Ferro. Set down<br />on the landing grid.
2111207 2114257 Immediate dust off on my<br />clear, then stay on station.
2127924 2129904 <i>Down and clear.</i>
2131424 2133541 Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.
2136633 2139889 All right. I want a nice,<br />clean dispersal this time.
2141633 2143868 Let's go! Move it out!
2144600 2145854 Head 'em up!
2166674 2170587 First squad up on line. Hicks, get<br />yours in accord and watch the rear.
2170671 2173715 Vasquez, take point. Let's move!
2181565 2183079 Move up.
2186400 2188213 Hudson, run a bypass.
2193899 2196749 Second squad, move<br />up. Flanking positions.
2196899 2199045 <i>Second squad on line.</i>
2227607 2229342 You set?
2232732 2234386 Go on.
2259949 2262899 Second team, move inside.<br />Hicks, take the upper level.
2290866 2295753 <i>Sir, you copying this? Looks<br />like hits from small-arms fire.</i>
2295949 2298963 Uh, we got some explosives damage.
2299116 2301313 It's probably seismic survey charges.
2301449 2305155 Are you reading this?<br />Keep it tight, people.
2318490 2322359 <i>All right. Hicks, Hudson,<br />use your motion trackers.</i>
2340241 2343498 Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
2349490 2351559 Quarter and search by twos.
2363141 2365631 Okay. Dietrich, Frost, you're up.
2403633 2406524 Wait. Wait, tell him to--
2407592 2411217 Hicks, back up. Pan right.
2412467 2417524 - There.<br />- You seeing this all right?
2417934 2423349 Looks melted. Somebody must have<br />bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.
2423559 2425472 Acid for blood.
2425600 2429101 If you like that, you're gonna love this.
2442350 2444020 Quit screwing around.
2444141 2445852 Second squad, what's your status?
2445976 2449030 <i>Uh, we just finished our<br />sweep. Nobody's home.</i>
2449183 2451708 - Roger.<br />- Sir, this place is dead.
2451851 2454415 Whatever happened<br />here, I think we missed it.
2454559 2458468 All right. The area's secured. Let's go in<br />and see what their computer can tell us.
2458642 2461410 - Wait a minute. It's not secure.<br />- The area's secured, Ripley.
2462359 2464309 First team, head for Operations.
2464774 2467624 - Hudson, see if you can get their C.P.U. on line.<br />- Affirmative.
2467816 2471195 - Hicks, meet me at the south lock. We're coming in.<br />- Roger.
2471357 2474574 He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
2474733 2476727 <i>Pendejo</i> jerk-off.
2488278 2492187 Sir, they sealed off<br />this wing at both ends,
2492361 2495537 welded the doors and blocked<br />off the stairs with heavy equipment.
2495695 2499604 - <i>Mm-hmm.</i><br />- But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.
2499820 2501896 - Any bodies?<br />- No, sir.
2502029 2503901 Last stand.
2504029 2506430 <i>Must have been a hell of a fight.</i>
2506570 2509134 Yeah, looks that way.
2511111 2513187 <i>All right, Drake, this way.</i>
2513320 2516252 We should be able to cut<br />through the medlab to Operations.
2568070 2569943 <i>Lieutenant.</i>
2571820 2573774 Gorman.
2590895 2592823 Are those the same ones that--
2605611 2607606 Careful, Burke.
2617236 2621064 Looks like love at first sight to me.
2621236 2623517 Oh, he likes you, Burke.
2623653 2626218 Two are alive. The rest are dead.
2628153 2631043 "Surgically removed<br />before embryo implantation.
2631194 2635796 Subject Marachek, John J.,<br />died during the procedure."
2635987 2638348 They kilIed him taking it off.
2640381 2641853 Yo, Hicks.
2642737 2645220 I think we got something here.
2650029 2651942 - Behind us.<br />- One of us?
2653278 2656698 Apone, where are your<br />people? Anybody in "D" block?
2656862 2659630 <i>Ah, that's a negative.<br />We're all in Operations.</i>
2662695 2664690 Talk to me, Frosty.
2664820 2666733 Let's keep moving, baby.
2685194 2687108 - It's moving.<br />- Which way?
2687236 2690697 It's coming straight for us. Straight up.
2728278 2730191 - Fuck!<br />- Hold up.
2731820 2733285 Ripley.
2752820 2755833 Hey. Shh. It's all right.
2756029 2758226 It's all right. Come on.<br />Just grab her, Corporal.
2758361 2761375 Don't be afraid. Come<br />on. We won't hurt you.
2761528 2763767 Shh. It's all right. It's okay.
2763903 2766020 Come on out. Come on.
2766153 2768188 - Easy. Easy.<br />- I got her.
2768320 2770192 Ow! Damn!
2770320 2773007 Watch her! She's under<br />the grille! Don't let her go.
2773194 2776411 Frost, get your light up<br />here. Where'd she go?
2779403 2783108 Shine the light. Here. Here.
2783320 2784990 Here. Here. There she is.
2785111 2787636 <i>Keep back. Keep back. Don't scare her.</i>
2787820 2790425 - <i>Grab her, man. We're gonna lose her.</i><br />- <i>Damn it!</i>
2792778 2794651 <i>Kick it out!</i>
2795737 2798831 Wait.
2824528 2827418 It's okay. It's all right.
2828486 2832192 Don't be afraid.
2832361 2834356 See?
2834528 2836401 Wait. No, you don't.
2836753 2840433 It's okay. You're gonna be all right now.
2840517 2842052 Shh.
2842236 2846308 Easy. Easy. It's gonna be okay.
2846486 2848930 It's alI right. You're gonna be okay.
2849070 2851064 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
2851194 2854208 Easy. Easy.
2890292 2892736 - What's her name again?<br />- Rebecca.
2892820 2896688 Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.
2896862 2899630 Just start at the beginning.
2900178 2902151 Where are your parents?
2902903 2905060 Now, look, Rebecca,<br />you have to try and help--
2905194 2907760 Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?
2911116 2912703 Total brain lock.
2912987 2914859 Physically, she's okay.
2914987 2918121 Borderline malnutrition, but I don't<br />think there's any permanent damage.
2918478 2920840 Come on. We're wasting our time.
2930436 2932717 Try this.
2932853 2935134 It's a little hot chocolate.
2936686 2939048 There you go.
2939187 2941343 Whoop.
2941478 2943391 That good, huh?
2947811 2951191 Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.
2951353 2955059 Now I've done it. Guess I'll<br />have to do the whole thing.
2964686 2968148 Hard to believe there's<br />a little girl under all this.
2970229 2972344 And a pretty one too.
2976836 2979361 You don't talk much, do you?
2988020 2989933 Smoking or nonsmoking?
2990062 2991934 Just tell me what you're<br />scanning for, Private.
2992062 2993934 - P.D.T's.<br />- What?
2994062 2995934 Personal data transmitters.
2996062 2998545 Every colonist had<br />one surgically implanted.
2998686 3001781 If they're within 20 klicks,<br />we'll read it out here.
3001937 3004053 So far, zippo.
3004187 3007036 I don't know how you<br />managed to stay alive,
3007187 3009507 but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
3011561 3013475 N-Newt.
3015520 3018940 - What'd you say?<br />- Newt.
3019103 3021260 My name's Newt.
3021394 3026404 Nobody calls me<br />Rebecca except my brother.
3026603 3030390 Newt? I like that.
3030561 3034267 I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.
3036353 3039366 And who is this, hmm?
3039561 3043186 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3043353 3046243 What about your brother? What's his name?
3046394 3048389 Timmy.
3048520 3052877 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3056220 3058133 Any sisters?
3061803 3063676 Mom and dad?
3066553 3070706 Newt, look at me. Where are they?
3070886 3073859 They're dead, all right? Can I go now?
3077053 3079455 I'm sorry, Newt.
3079594 3082119 Don't you think you'd<br />be safer here with us?
3086053 3088048 These people are here to protect you.
3088178 3090092 They're soldiers.
3090220 3092988 It won't make any difference.
3106511 3108506 Need anything else?
3111095 3113985 Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?
3115928 3117923 No.
3120053 3122129 That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop.
3122262 3125111 Magnificent, isn't it?
3125262 3130149 Yo! Stop your grinnin' and<br />drop your linen! Found 'em.
3130187 3132670 - They alive?<br />- Unknown,
3132811 3134684 but it looks like all of them.
3134811 3138883 Over at the processing<br />station, Sublevel 3,
3139662 3141264 under the main cooling towers.
3142728 3145293 Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
3145436 3147309 Let's saddle up, Apone.
3147393 3149332 Aye, sir.
3149811 3152335 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.
3152478 3154391 Let's go. Head 'em out!
3154475 3156429 Okay, Frost, you're driving.
3168311 3171691 It's okay. Don't worry. It'll be okay.
3212270 3216179 <i>I want a straight "V" deployment,<br />second team on left flank.</i>
3216353 3220302 Advance on axial 664. Tracker on line.
3220478 3223532 Set the "V" gain to filter R.F. ambient.
3223686 3227107 <i>Hudson, tracker on line.<br />Left and right, little buddy.</i>
3229020 3233092 <i>Forty meters in, bearing 221,<br />there should be a stairwell.</i>

3236686 3238559 <i>You want Sublevel 3.</i>
3240811 3243010 <i>Let's go, people.<br />Hudson, you got the point.</i>
3243145 3245466 Hicks, watch our tails.
3245603 3248698 Nice and easy. Check those corners.
3249653 3251051 Check those corners.
3254478 3257043 - Watch your spacing.<br />- <i>All right. You heard the man.</i>
3257127 3258999 Don't bunch up. Stay loose.
3259187 3261874 <i>Uh, your transmission's<br />showing a lot of breakup.</i>
3262514 3265427 <i>Probably getting some<br />interference from the structure.</i>
3265511 3267087 <i>Use those lights.</i>
3268520 3272796 <i>Next one down, and proceed on a 216.</i>
3272978 3275095 <i>Uh, roger. That's a 216.</i>
3276753 3279685 <i>I'm not making that out<br />too well. What is it, Hudson?</i>
3279836 3282726 You tell me, man. I only work here.
3297878 3299913 What is that?
3300645 3302202 I don't know.
3303961 3306200 Proceed inside.
3322045 3324654 <i>Watch your fire and check your targets.</i>
3324803 3327084 <i>Remember we're<br />looking for civvies in here.</i>
3336928 3338801 <i>Easy.</i>
3338928 3341331 <i>Tighten it up, Frost.<br />We're getting a little thin.</i>
3342978 3344817 <i>Nice and easy.</i>
3347761 3349634 Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
3349761 3353467 Yeah, but secreted from what?
3353636 3356242 Nobody touch nothing.
3356787 3358877 Busy little creatures, huh?
3359829 3361926 Hot as hell in here.
3361961 3363834 Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.
3363961 3365875 <i>Knock it off, Hudson.</i>
3373836 3377094 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
3377253 3379575 Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
3379711 3381625 Standard light armor-piercing round.
3381753 3383951 - Why?<br />- Well, look where your team is.
3384086 3387263 They're right under the<br />primary heat exchangers.
3387420 3388874 So?
3389103 3392727 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
3392895 3397548 - Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.<br />- So? So what?
3397829 3402140 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
3402873 3404094 Right?
3404378 3409139 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and <i>adios, muchachos.</i>
3409187 3411752 Oh, great. Wonderful.
3412636 3414165 Shit!
3416587 3420333 Look. Uh... Apone.
3421753 3425092 Look. We can't have any firing in there.
3425253 3428918 I, uh, I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
3429086 3433036 - Is he fuckin' crazy?<br />- What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?
3433211 3435980 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I--
3436128 3439018 Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.
3440794 3444785 All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.<br />Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.
3445878 3448525 Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.
3451462 3453700 Damn!
3453836 3455912 You too. Give it up,<br />Ski. Come on. Let's go.
3456045 3458935 Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.
3459086 3461000 Right on, Vas.
3462295 3464167 Let's go, marine. Give it up.
3464295 3466371 Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.
3466503 3469312 - Thanks a lot, Sarge.<br />- Hicks, cover our ass.
3469262 3471134 Head 'em out, people.
3473262 3476763 I like to keep this handy...<br />for close encounters.
3476928 3478801 I heard that.
3487761 3489634 <i>Any movement?</i>
3489761 3492368 Nothing. Zip.
3505137 3507498 Holy shit.
3520345 3522788 <i>Newt, go sit up front.</i>
3522928 3525372 Go on! Now!
3554053 3557240 <i>Steady, people. Let's finish our sweep.</i>
3557286 3560325 We're still marines,<br />and we got a job to do.
3560587 3564211 Keep it moving. Easy.
3596253 3597840 - Help!<br />- What?
3597961 3600648 Top, get over here. We got a<br />live one! You're gonna be all right.
3600794 3603889 Please... k-kill me.
3603890 3606399 <i>Just stay calm. We're<br />gonna get you outta here.</i>
3606703 3609228 It's gonna be all right. Give me a<br />hand. We gotta get her outta here.
3609370 3611891 - What is it, Dietrich?<br />- Convulsion!
3613289 3614894 Dietrich, get back!
3615178 3616599 Get back!
3624278 3627495 - No!<br />- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!
3627653 3629918 Get back! Flamethrower! Move!
3660908 3662077 Movement!
3662168 3663947 What's the position?
3664831 3666810 I can't lock in!
3667094 3669416 Talk to me, Hudson!
3669553 3671548 Multiple signals.
3672003 3674080 They're closing.
3675011 3677928 Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!
3678386 3681644 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
3681803 3683676 Pull your team out, Gorman.
3688753 3692040 I got signals. I got<br />readings in front and behind.
3692186 3694444 Where, man? I don't see shit.
3694478 3696621 He's right. There's nothing back here.
3696661 3699264 Look, I'm telling you. There's<br />something moving, and it ain't us!
3701162 3704094 - Oh, shit.<br />- <i>Tracker's off scale, man.</i>
3704245 3707461 They're all around us, man! Jesus!
3707620 3710469 Maybe they don't show<br />up on infrared at all.
3720786 3722389 Frost!
3727570 3729184 Come on!
3736386 3739011 Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on?
3739053 3741103 <i>Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!</i>
3741294 3745203 Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off!<br />Frost! Dietrich, Frost, off the board!
3746711 3747933 Frost!
3751028 3752789 Wierzbowski?
3753253 3755900 - Wierzbowski?
3757087 3758870 Let's rock!
3762661 3764649 Who's firing? Goddamn it!
3765487 3766666 Yeah!
3766820 3770469 - I ordered to hold fire.<br />- <i>They're coming out of the walls!</i>
3770545 3772825 They're coming out of the<br />goddamn walls! Let's book!
3773003 3775160 - <i>On the right, man.</i><br />- Uh, Apone,
3775294 3777982 I want you to lay down a<br />suppressing fire with the incinerators--
3778129 3781115 Vasquez, Drake, hold<br />your fire, goddamn it!
3781162 3784989 <i>Apone, are you copying me? I want<br />you to lay down suppressing fire...</i>
3785162 3787804 with the incinerators and fall<br />back by squads to the A.P.C.
3787986 3790308 - Over.<br />- Say again, all after "incinerator."
3790445 3795005 I said I want you to lay down a suppressing<br />fire with the incinerators and fall back
3795237 3797720 by squads to the A.P.C. Over.
3798694 3799712 Hey!
3801694 3804056 - <i>Sarge! Sarge!</i><br />- Apone.
3804195 3806556 Talk to me. Apone? Copy! Copy!
3806694 3808933 Talk to me, Apone. He's gone!
3810653 3812974 Get them out of there! Shut up!
3813153 3815962 - Do it now! Hicks, whoever's left, get--<br />- Shut up!
3816153 3817985 Just shut up! Goddamn it!
3818153 3822470 It's coming out of the goddamn<br />walls! Where's Apone? Where's Apone?
3822653 3824892 The sarge is gone! Let's<br />get the fuck out of here!
3825028 3828334 Let's move it! Let's go, marine!
3828903 3831916 Hudson? Vasquez?
3832511 3834725 Hudson, look out! Get it!
3836520 3838074 Watch it!
3838403 3840724 Hicks. Come on. Behind you! Fall back!
3840903 3844283 - I told them to fall back.<br />- <i>Fall back, goddamn it, now!</i>
3844487 3846319 - They're cut off!<br />- <i>Hudson, move your ass!</i>
3846487 3848319 - Do something!<br />- <i>Let's go, marine!</i>
3848445 3850358 Fuck!
3850529 3853119 - Come on. Keep moving, baby.<br />- Hold on, Newt.
3859678 3862355 Ripley, what the hell are you doing?
3868445 3870114 Turn around!
3873529 3875849 That's an order!
3879403 3882782 Get off me, damn it!<br />Goddamn it, that's an order!
3882945 3885591 You had your chance, Gorman.
3896986 3898859 Come on!
3918445 3921010 Come on. Let's move it!
3921153 3923434 <i>Come on! Let's go! Let's go!</i>
3923570 3926949 <i>It's blocked, man. We gotta go around!</i>
3927111 3931794 - Open the door! Hicks!<br />- Drake, we are leaving!
3931986 3933940 <i>Get them, man!</i>
3934861 3937386 Run for it!
3938929 3940630 Shit!
3945336 3947612 - Go! Go!<br />- Come on, man! Come on!</i>
3955070 3958857 Drake, come on!
3961487 3963643 No!
3965778 3968546 - Fire in the hole!<br />- <i>He's gone!</i>
3968694 3970527 Put it out! Put it out! Go! Go!
3970653 3974278 - Come on. Put it out!<br />- Drake's coming, man!
3974487 3977377 - Drake! No, he's not!<br />- He's gone!
3978861 3980775 Forget him! He's gone!
3986653 3988526 They're in the goddamn door!
3991986 3993332 Eat this!
3997148 3998261 <i>Ripley!</i>
3998345 4000625 Go, go, go!
4063186 4065059 It's all right! We're clear!
4065186 4067548 Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
4067687 4069559 You're just grinding metal!
4069687 4071843 Come on, ease down.
4071978 4073673 Ease down.
4073903 4077568 Ease down. Ease down.
4089320 4091518 You okay?
4092545 4094539 - I'm all right.<br />- Hudson.
4094870 4096864 Get away from me, man!
4097637 4100946 - Lieutenant.<br />- What happened to Gorman?
4101520 4104596 I don't know. Maybe a concussion.
4104653 4106892 - But he's alive.<br />- He's dead!
4107028 4109063 Wake up, pendejo, and<br />then I'm gonna kill you!
4109195 4112330 Back off. Right now.
4113861 4116956 - Fuck!<br />- Somebody get me a first aid kit.
4117111 4119666 Hey. Hey, look.
4120320 4123236 The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
4123694 4125848 Their signs are real<br />low, but they ain't dead.
4125849 4127747 - Then we go back in there and get them.<br />- Fuck that!
4127953 4130075 - We don't leave our people behind--<br />- I ain't going back in there.
4130159 4132161 You can't help them!
4133153 4137914 You can't. Right now they're<br />being cocooned just like the others.
4142111 4146265 - Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happenin', man.<br />- Damn it.
4146445 4149459 This can't be happenin', man.<br />This isn't happenin'!
4149611 4153072 All right. We got 7 canisters of CN-20.
4153237 4156494 I say we roll them in there and<br />nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4156653 4159381 That's worth a try, but we don't<br />even know if it's gonna affect them.
4159529 4163885 Let's just bug out and call it even.<br />Okay? What are we talking about this for?
4164070 4167694 I say we take off and nuke<br />the entire site from orbit.
4170653 4172526 It's the only way to be sure.
4172653 4175829 - Fuckin' "A"!<br />- Hold on. Hold on one second.
4175986 4180058 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4180237 4182679 They can bill me.
4182820 4187747 Okay, look. This is an emotional<br />moment for all of us, okay?
4187945 4191284 I know that. But let's not<br />make snap judgments, please.
4191445 4194335 This is clearly- clearly an<br />important species we're dealing with,
4194487 4197174 and I don't think that you or<br />I or anybody has the right...
4197320 4200333 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4200487 4201992 Yeah. Watch us.
4202111 4204350 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4204487 4207092 but we just got our asses kicked, pal!
4207237 4210494 Look. I'm not blind to what's going on,
4210653 4213178 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action.
4213320 4215355 I'm sorry.
4216529 4219378 Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...
4219529 4221442 has authority here.
4222986 4224859 Corporal Hicks is--
4224986 4227308 This operation is under<br />military jurisdiction,
4227445 4229318 and Hicks is next in chain of command.
4229445 4231561 Am I right, Corporal?
4231694 4233608 Yeah.
4234820 4237263 Yeah, that's right.
4237445 4239440 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4239570 4241972 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4242111 4243984 He can't make that kind of decision.
4244111 4246635 He's just a grunt. Uh, no offense.
4246778 4250444 - None taken.<br />- Ferro, do you copy? Standing by.
4250611 4253217 Prep for dust off. We're<br />gonna need immediate evac.
4253262 4255034 Roger. On our way.
4255162 4260581 I say we take off, nuke the site<br />from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
4262411 4264122 Let's do it.
4271245 4274705 Let's go. Pick it up,<br />Hudson. Pick it up, baby.
4279995 4282112 All right. Set him down here.
4288745 4291039 Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.
4295953 4297826 Hold on a second. There's something--
4297953 4300192 <i>Just get up here.</i>
4300329 4302771 I'm in. Ramp closing.
4322536 4324449 Spunkmeyer.
4325703 4327403 Goddamn it.
4329453 4331733 Well, where the fuck--
4344536 4346409 Run!
4387287 4390992 Well, that's great. That's<br />just fuckin' great, man.
4391162 4393564 Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
4393703 4395942 We're in some real pretty shit now, man!
4396078 4398399 Are you finished?
4401287 4403200 You all right?
4408453 4412565 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
4412745 4414292 I'm sorry, Newt.
4414358 4417092 You don't have to be<br />sorry. It wasn't your fault.
4417181 4418274 That's it, man.
4418453 4420774 Game over, man! Game over!
4420911 4423476 What the fuck are we gonna<br />do now? What are we gonna do?
4423620 4427937 Maybe we could build a fire. Sing a<br />couple of songs? Why don't we try that?
4428120 4430807 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
4430953 4434252 and they mostly come at night, mostly.
4450763 4454672 That's everything, right? All<br />right. This is absolutely everything...
4454846 4457778 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
4457929 4461390 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
4461554 4463671 That ain't so good.
4463804 4467388 We got, uh, 15 of these M-40 grenades.
4467554 4469467 Don't touch that.
4469637 4472039 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
4472579 4475528 <i>Yeah. It's only half<br />full, but it's functional.</i>
4476104 4479768 Got another one, it's damaged--<br />I don't know about that one.
4480604 4484920 How long after we're declared<br />overdue can we expect a rescue?
4487062 4489138 Seventeen days.
4490187 4492671 Seventeen days?
4492812 4496600 Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your<br />parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
4496771 4500313 Those things are gonna come in here like<br />they did before. They're gonna come in here--
4500425 4501471 Hudson! Hudson!
4501521 4503487 They're gonna come in<br />here and they're gonna get us!
4503688 4505682 This little girl survived<br />longer than that...
4505812 4508784 with no weapons and no training.
4508937 4510809 Right?
4513229 4515875 Why don't you put her in charge?
4516020 4518788 You'd better just start dealing<br />with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
4518937 4521054 Hudson, just deal with<br />it because we need you.
4521187 4523060 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
4523587 4527089 Now, I want you to get on a terminal<br />and call up some kind of floor plan file.
4527253 4529901 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
4530046 4532326 Anything that shows the layout<br />of this place. Are you listening?
4532504 4535017 - Yeah.<br />- I need to see air ducts.
4535271 4538569 I need to see electrical<br />access tunnels, subbasements,
4538729 4542313 every possible way into this complex.
4542479 4546877 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
4547104 4549602 - Okay, I'm on it.<br />- Hudson!
4550037 4552238 Just relax.
4557563 4562450 I'll be in medlab. I'll check on<br />Gorman, continue my analysis.
4562646 4565536 Fine. You do that.
4572412 4575559 So this service tunnel must be<br />how they're moving back and forth.
4575729 4578172 That's right. It moves from<br />the processing station...
4578312 4580593 right into the sublevel here.
4582688 4585944 Come down on that. Okay, come over.
4586104 4589239 Hold. Go back. Okay,<br />punch that in right there.
4594979 4596973 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
4598521 4601167 Well, there's a<br />pressure door at this end.
4601312 4605454 We could close that, weld it shut.<br />That should hold 'em for a while.
4605477 4607862 But we gotta figure on<br />them getting into the complex.
4607862 4612259 That's right, so we repair the<br />barricades at these two intersections.
4612471 4614954 - Right.<br />- And weld plate steel over these ducts..
4615095 4618923 here and here and here.
4619095 4622068 That should seal off<br />Medlab and Operations.
4622220 4625741 Outstanding. Now all we<br />need is a deck of cards.
4628012 4630047 All right, people. Let's<br />move like we got a purpose.
4630220 4632908 - <i>Affirmative.</i><br />- Affirmative.
4635387 4638767 We're sealing the tunnel.<br />Baby, hurry up. Come on.
4651012 4652885 For what it's worth.
4654888 4657126 Here. I want you to put this on.
4658512 4660711 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
4660846 4664265 Then I can find you anywhere<br />in the complex on this.
4666179 4670169 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.
4670345 4673073 Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
4673220 4675134 All right, what's next?
4692471 4694465 Last stop.
4698512 4700385 Get in.
4700512 4704503 Scoot down. That's good.
4704679 4708629 Now, you lie here and<br />have a nap. You're very tired.
4708804 4712102 I don't want to. I have scary dreams.
4714554 4717567 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
4717721 4719393 Let's take a look.
4719721 4722000 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
4722137 4726331 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
4726512 4728955 Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...
4729095 4732068 because she's just a piece of plastic.
4732220 4735641 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
4742429 4744627 There.
4744763 4747571 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
4747721 4750977 no real ones... but there are.
4752345 4754299 Yes, there are, aren't there?
4756429 4758710 Why do they tell little kids that?
4760637 4762510 Most of the time it's true.
4766053 4766949 Here.
4768346 4770137 Take this.
4771680 4773593 For luck.
4776847 4778760 There's that.
4780972 4782844 Don't go, please.
4782972 4786432 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
4786597 4788469 And you see that camera right up there?
4788597 4791324 I can see you right through that camera,
4791471 4793752 all the time to see if you're safe.
4798179 4800786 I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.
4800930 4804758 I mean that. That's a promise.
4804930 4807536 You promise?
4807680 4809919 I cross my heart.
4810054 4814248 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
4829221 4833579 Now go to sleep, and don't dream.
4837847 4839760 Sneak.
4848565 4852759 The molecular acid oxidizes after the<br />creature's death, completely neutralizing it.
4852940 4856278 Bishop, you know, that's very interesting, but<br />it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?
4856440 4858924 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
4859064 4861100 Let's go through it again.
4861231 4863389 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there...
4863523 4867759 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
4867940 4871686 Which would mean that there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites, right?
4871857 4873973 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
4874106 4875979 Yes. That follows.
4876106 4880056 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
4882690 4884563 So who's laying these eggs?
4885490 4887303 I'm not sure.
4887857 4889973 It must be something we haven't seen yet.
4894482 4897739 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
4897899 4901115 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
4901273 4904653 that they were to be kept alive in<br />stasis for return to the company labs.
4906857 4908811 He was very specific about it.
4910242 4914151 Look. Those two specimens are worth<br />millions to the bio-weapons division, right?
4914325 4917623 Now, if you're smart, we can<br />both come out of this heroes,
4917784 4920919 and we will be set up for life.
4922033 4924558 You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?
4924700 4928772 Do you really think you can get a dangerous<br />organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?
4928951 4931760 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
4931909 4934882 But they will know<br />about it, Burke, from me.
4935033 4939146 Just like they'll know that you were<br />responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.
4939367 4941729 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
4941909 4943944 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
4944075 4947863 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
4948033 4950884 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
4951075 4953437 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
4953575 4956018 What if that ship didn't even<br />exist? Do you ever think about that?
4956158 4959742 I didn't know. So now if I went and<br />made a major security situation out of it,
4959951 4963248 everybody steps in, administration steps in,<br />and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.
4963408 4967358 Nobody wins. So I made a<br />decision, and it was wrong
4967534 4970180 It was a bad call,<br />Ripley. It was a bad call.
4970367 4971995 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
4972116 4973704 These people are dead, Burke!
4973826 4976187 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
4976325 4979175 I'm gonna make sure that they<br />nail you right to the wall for this!
4979325 4981523 You're not gonna sleaze<br />your way out of this one.
4981659 4983776 Right to the wall.
4985659 4988681 Ripley. I--
4988836 4990790 You know, I expected more from you.
4990919 4993769 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
4994719 4997057 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5004424 5007152 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5007299 5010760 That's it. Emergency venting.
5010925 5015444 Oh, that's beautiful, man. Oh,<br />man, that- that just beats it all.
5015674 5018442 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5018633 5021605 With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5021758 5025299 equal to about 40 megatons.
5025374 5026316 We got problems.
5026364 5028801 I don't believe this. I<br />don't fucking believe this.
5029049 5031492 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5031633 5033749 Why can't we shut it down from here?
5033883 5035755 I'm sorry. The crash<br />caused too much damage.
5035883 5038366 An overload is inevitable at this point.
5038507 5041357 Oh, man, and I was getting short.
5041507 5044765 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5044966 5046960 - It ain't half fair, man.<br />- Hudson, give us a break!
5047090 5049615 <i>Four more weeks. Oh, man.</i>
5049758 5052893 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the <i>Sulaco.</i>
5053049 5055939 I mean, there must be some<br />way of bringing it down on remote.
5056090 5059511 How? The transmitter was<br />on the A.P.C. It's wasted.
5059716 5062852 I don't care how, but we'd better think<br />of something. We'd better think of a way.
5063049 5065818 - Think of what? We're fucked! We're doomed!<br />- Shut up!
5065966 5068694 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5068841 5071569 The uplink tower down at the<br />other end. Why can't we use that?
5071716 5074606 No, I checked. The hardware in<br />between here and there was damaged.
5074758 5076630 We can't align the dish.
5076758 5079119 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5079257 5082107 take a portable terminal, go<br />out there and patch in manually.
5082257 5087185 Yeah, sure. With those things<br />running around? You can count me out.
5087424 5089378 - Guess we can just count you out of everything.<br />- I'll go.
5089507 5091258 <i>That's right, man. Why don't you go, man?</i>
5091424 5093215 - <i>I'll go.</i><br />- What?
5093341 5097576 I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one<br />qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway.
5097758 5102033 Yeah, right, man. Bishop<br />should go. Good idea.
5102266 5104382 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
5104466 5107315 I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
5119732 5120905 <i>How long?</i>
5121132 5124308 This conduit runs almost to the<br />uplink assembly... 180 meters.
5124507 5127724 - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there--<br />- <i>Right.</i>
5127883 5131548 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
5132716 5134914 Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
5135090 5138226 - and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />- It's gonna be close.
5142799 5145445 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.
5146966 5150672 Watch your fingers.
5153158 5154900 <i>Vaya con Dios,</i> man.
5167847 5170697 I want you two walking perimeter.
5170847 5173003 Hey, listen.
5173138 5175787 We're all in strung-out shape,
5176138 5179355 but stay frosty and alert.
5180889 5183657 We can't afford to let one<br />of those bastards in here.
5183805 5187081 All right. <i>Vámonos.</i>
5196809 5198763 How long's it been<br />since you got any sleep?
5199693 5201434 Twenty-four hours?
5202601 5205818 Hicks, I'm not gonna<br />end up like those others.
5205976 5208744 You'll take care of it, won't you?
5210392 5214831 If it comes to that, I'll do us both.
5216642 5219288 Listen, let's just make<br />sure it doesn't come to that.
5219475 5222976 - All right?<br />- All right.
5223142 5228232 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
5228434 5232261 This is an M-41A<br />pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,
5232434 5236180 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
5236750 5238464 Feel the weight.
5245225 5247464 Okay, what do I do?
5252934 5255499 - Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />- Right.
5255684 5257923 - Uh-huh. Lean into it.<br />- Mm-hmm.
5258058 5260665 All right. Now, it will kick some.
5260809 5264269 All right. When the counter<br />reads zero here, you--
5264475 5266674 - I press this up?<br />- That's right.
5268809 5271863 Get another one in<br />quick. Slap it in hard.
5272167 5274799 - Right.<br />- And you're ready to rock and roll.
5275183 5278512 - What's this?<br />- That's the grenade launcher.
5278658 5280746 I don't think you want to mess with that.
5281093 5284502 You started this. Show me everything.
5284976 5286889 I can handle myself.
5288717 5290430 Yeah, I noticed.
5300801 5302714 How do you feel?
5302842 5306262 All right, I guess.<br />One hell of a hangover.
5307884 5310042 - Look, Ripley, I just want--<br />- Forget it.
5310176 5311889 Excuse me.
5367093 5371734 Shh, shh, shh, shh,<br />shh. It's okay. It's okay.
5441109 5444448 Newt, wake up.
5444609 5446482 - Wha--<br />- Be quiet.
5446609 5448563 We're in trouble.
5466109 5467859 No!
5468783 5470590 Move, Newt!
5491909 5493781 Hey!
5502625 5506761 Help! Help!
5506842 5508756 - Hicks!<br />- Somebody!
5508884 5510757 <i>Say again, Bishop.</i>
5510884 5513741 You've got it into auto-refuel<br />mode, and it's sequencing right?
5513942 5516874 - <i>That's right.</i><br />- Okay, good. Stay on it.
5517948 5520209 Get back to me when you've<br />activated the launch cycle.
5520693 5523868 - Roger.<br />- He's at the uplink tower.
5524067 5526310 - Good.<br />- Terrific.
5528275 5531207 - <i>Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!</i><br />- <i>Help!</i>
5531359 5533883 - Help! Help!<br />- Hicks, help us!
5534025 5538016 - Break the glass! Break it. Break it.<br />- Yes.
5538192 5540146 I'll try.
5560442 5562844 Ripley, I'm scared.
5563383 5565337 Me too.
5570442 5572396 Stay here.
5584834 5587206 It's the Medlab. Hudson!
5587359 5590617 Vasquez, meet me in<br />Medlab. We got a fire.
5590701 5592255 <i>We're on our way.</i>
5595651 5597605 They're coming, Newt.
5630392 5632127 Shoot it out!
5636475 5638307 - Hudson!<br />- Jesus.
5641734 5644014 Christ, kid, look out!
5652383 5653360 Fucking die.
5664858 5667994 - Over there! Ready?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
5668150 5669738 <i>Now!</i>
5673275 5675107 - Hudson?<br />- Yeah. All clear.
5675275 5677759 Nailed the other one. It's history, man.
5679234 5681106 Jesus.
5682317 5685818 Burke... It was Burke.
5688150 5691286 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
5691442 5694292 Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
5697317 5701267 He figured that he could get an<br />alien back through quarantine...
5701442 5704188 if one of us was impregnated...
5705442 5707600 whatever you call it...
5707734 5710258 and then frozen for the trip home.
5710401 5714350 Nobody would know about<br />the embryos we were carrying...
5714526 5716520 me and Newt.
5718401 5720314 Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
5720442 5722641 Yes. The only way he could do it...
5722776 5726441 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
5726609 5728933 Namely yours.
5729275 5733062 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
5733234 5738487 Fuck! He's dead. You're dog meat, pal.
5739609 5741482 This is so nuts.
5741609 5744174 I mean, listen... listen<br />to what you're saying.
5744317 5746922 It's paranoid delusion.
5747067 5751303 It's really sad. It's pathetic.
5751484 5755189 You know, Burke, I don't<br />know which species is worse.
5755359 5758576 You don't see them fucking each<br />other over for a goddamn percentage.
5759334 5761787 All right. We waste him. No offense.
5761942 5763571 No! He's gotta go back--
5765776 5768341 - They cut the power.<br />- What do you mean, "they" cut the power?
5768484 5770030 How could they cut the<br />power, man? They're animals.
5770150 5772675 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!
5772817 5774690 - <i>Gorman, watch Burke!</i><br />- I got him.
5774817 5777056 Newt, stay close.
5780609 5783623 - I'll go this side.<br />- You do that, man.
5807401 5810128 - Anything?<br />- <i>There's something.</i>
5811483 5813683 It's inside the complex.
5813967 5815621 You're just reading <i>me.</i>
5816526 5818398 No, no, it ain't you.
5820609 5824192 They're inside- inside the<br />perimeter. They're in here.
5824359 5827738 <i>Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?</i>
5834567 5836113 Hudson may be right.
5836275 5839330 - Get back, both of you!<br />- <i>The signal's weird.</i>
5840776 5843381 Must be some interference or something.
5843526 5845398 There's movement all over the place!
5845526 5849482 Get back to Operations. It's game time.
5849942 5851263 Newt.
5852858 5855668 Seal the door. Hurry!
5855817 5859196 Come on! Come on! Come on! Get back!
5859359 5861231 Work fast.
5864651 5867745 Cover your eyes, Newt.<br />Don't look at the light.
5867900 5870832 Movement. Signal's clean.
5870983 5872856 Range, 20 meters.
5872983 5875100 They found a way in, something we missed.
5875234 5877106 We didn't miss anything.
5877234 5880939 Eighteen... seventeen meters.
5881109 5883430 Something under the floor,<br />not in the plans. I don't know.
5883567 5885603 - Fifteen meters.<br />- Ripley!
5885734 5889154 - Definitely inside the barricades.<br />- Let's go.
5890858 5892691 - Thirteen meters.<br />- That's right outside the door.
5892858 5895424 - Hicks, Vasquez, get back!<br />- This is a big fucking signal.
5895567 5898703 - How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me.<br />- Almost there.
5900401 5902722 That's it.
5902858 5907052 Twelve meters... eleven.

6366684 6368157 Newt?

6526642 6528393 Plenty. Twenty-six minutes.
6528559 6531457 - We're not leaving.<br />- We're not?
6615835 6616598 Ripley--
6616612 6620128 I don't wanna hear about it,<br />Bishop. She's alive. There's still time.
6620294 6623107 In 19 minutes, this area is gonna be<br />a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
6623120 6626048 - Hicks, don't let him leave.<br />- We ain't going anywhere.

7527753 7529707 I knew you'd come.
7544669 7546785 He's gonna be all right. He's just out.
7546919 7549240 I had to give him<br />another shot for the pain.

7553169 7555123 Okay.
7560835 7564744 I'm sorry if I scared you. That<br />platform was just becoming too unstable.
7564919 7567647 I had to circle and hope that things<br />didn't get too rough to take you off.
7567794 7571763 Bishop, you did okay.

8014702 8017593 Are we gonna sleep all the way home?
8017786 8020718 - All the way home.<br />- Can I dream?
8023077 8025642 Yes, honey. I think we both can.
