307782 310784 Well, there goes our salvage, guys.
337228 340356 - How are we today?<br />- Ohh. Terrible.
340440 343317 Well, better than yesterday, at least.
343401 346153 - Where am I?<br />- You're safe.
346237 348655 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
348740 352159 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're okay.
352243 354745 Oh, looks like you've<br />got a visitor.
356623 358957 Jonesy. Come here.
360126 362252 Hey, come here.
362337 364713 How are you, you stupid cat?
364798 368717 How are you?<br />Where have you been?
368802 372638 Guess you two have met, huh?<br />I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
372722 377267 I work for the company, but don't let<br />that fool you. I'm really an okay guy.
378561 380479 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
380563 384108 They tell me that all the weakness<br />and disorientation should pass soon.
384234 390114 That's just natural side effects of such an<br />unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.
390198 392366 What do you mean?
392450 394827 How long was I out there?
394911 396995 <i>(Woman on P.A.)<br />Inhalation Therapy, report to...</i>
397080 399331 Has no one discussed<br />this with you yet?
399416 401417 No. But, I mean...
401501 405504 I don't...<br />recognize this place.
405588 407589 No, I know. Uh...
407674 411385 Okay. It's just that, uh,<br />this might be a shock to you.
411511 414096 - It's long--<br />- How long?
414180 416181 Please.
417183 421145 - 57 years.<br />- What?
421229 425482 That's the thing. You were<br />out there for 57 years.
425567 428694 What happened was you had drifted<br />right through the core systems.
428778 431613 And it's really just blind luck...
431698 434908 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
434993 437286 It's one in a thousand, really.
437370 442082 I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.<br />You could be floating out there forever.
442167 445377 You--you okay?
445462 448297 - <i>(Hisses)</i><br />- Uhh--
448381 451717 <i>(Heart pounding)</i>
451801 454553 - <i>(Hisses)</i><br />- Uuh!
454637 456889 You okay?
456973 459141 <i>(Groaning)</i>
461436 466231 - <i>(Hisses)</i><br />- Oh-h-h! Oh, God!
467650 471195 - Nurse! Please!<br />- God!
471321 474281 - Someone get in here now!<br />- <i>(Screaming)</i>
474365 476408 Now!
476493 478702 - Hold!<br />- Please.
478786 480996 Hold on!
481080 483081 Kill me!
490757 494676 No!
495678 497763 <i>(Gasping)</i><br />Uh!
500475 503602 Bad dreams again? You want<br />something to help you sleep?
503686 505938 No.
506022 508023 <i>(Sighs)</i><br />I've slept enough.
509945 512197 Jonesy.
512281 514282 Come here.
514366 516451 - <i>(Meows)</i><br />- Shh.
520748 522749 It's all right.
523751 527545 - It's all right now.<br />- <i>(Purring)</i>
527630 529672 It's over.
532760 535011 <i>(Man #1) I'd just<br />like to go, uh...</i>
535095 537263 back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.
537389 540934 <i>(Man #2) Is it in the file?<br />I don't understand this.</i>
541018 543519 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
543604 545772 Now, how many different ways do you<br />want me to tell the same story?
547151 551779 Look at it from our perspective, please.
551864 553865 Please?
556285 558745 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
558829 561664 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class starfreighter,
561749 564208 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
564293 567503 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
567588 570339 That's minus payload, of course.
570424 574802 The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates<br />some elements of your account,
574887 579932 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
580017 584562 an unsurveyed pIanet at that time,<br />that it resumed its course...
584646 589567 and was subsequently set for self-destruct<br />by you for reasons unknown.
589651 591986 Not for reasons unknown.<br />I told you.
592112 597825 We set down there on company orders to get<br />this thing, which destroyed my crew...
597910 600369 and your expensive ship.
600454 604123 The analysis team, which went over<br />the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
604208 607335 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
607419 611464 Good! That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn air lock,
613133 615218 like I said.
616970 621557 Are there any species like this<br />hostile organism on LV-426?
621642 624143 No. It's a rock.<br />No indigenous life.
626146 629732 Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply<br />while I was away?
629817 632193 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
632277 635029 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
635113 639700 It was not from there. Do you get it?<br />We homed in on its beacon.
639785 642578 And found something<br />never recorded once...
642663 646165 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
646250 649545 "A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host."<br />95.5<br />00:10:50,045--> 00:10:51,045<br />Yes.
651129 655049 These are your words.<br />"And has concentrated acid for blood."
655133 657385 That's right.
657469 661389 Look. I can see where this is going,
661473 663891 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
664017 667186 - Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all.<br />- Please. You're not listening to me.
667271 669772 Kane, the crew member...
669857 673568 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
673694 675736 - Thousands.<br />- Thank you. That will be all.
675821 677864 Goddamn it, that's not all!
677948 681659 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
681743 684287 Then all of this- this bullshit<br />that you think is so important...
684371 688165 You can just kiss<br />all of that good-bye!
703606 705691 That could have been better.
705817 709278 - Look, I think the-- Ripley?<br />- Van Leuwen.
709362 712614 Why don't you just check out LV-426?
712699 716451 Because I don't have to. There have been<br />people there for over 20 years,
716577 718600 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
718700 721248 What do you mean? What people?
721332 724459 Terraformers.<br />Planet engineers.
724544 728255 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
728339 730632 Takes decades.
730717 732968 It's what we call a<br />"Shake 'N Bake" colony.
733052 736680 How many are there?<br />How many colonists?
736764 741268 I don't know... 60, maybe 70 families.<br />Do you mind?
743938 745939 "Families."
748192 750193 Jesus.
772550 773884 <i>(Meowing)</i>
780441 782483 <i>(Doorbell beeps)</i>
783652 786738 <i>(Clears throat)</i>
786822 789032 Hiya, Ripley.<br />This is Lieutenant Gorman...
789116 792243 of the Colonial Marine Corps--
792328 794579 Ripley, we have to talk.
794663 798374 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
804840 807050 I don't believe this.
807176 811721 You guys throw me at the wolves,<br />and now you want me to go back out there?
811805 814390 Forget it.<br />It's not my problem.
814516 818102 - Can I finish?<br />- No. There's no way.
819521 821606 Ripley, you wouldn't be going in<br />with the troops.
821690 824025 I can guarantee your safety.
824109 826611 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough <i>hombres.</i>
826695 829572 They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.
829657 830823 There's nothing they can't handle.
832248 834541 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- That's true.
834626 836794 We've been trained to deal<br />with situations like this.
836878 840506 Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
840632 843217 <i>(Burke) Yeah, but we don't know exactly<br />what's going on out there.</i>
843301 845886 It may just be<br />a downed transmitter, okay?
845970 850432 But if it's not, I would like<br />you there as an adviser,
850517 852434 and that's all.
852519 855437 Look, I don't have time for this.<br />I've got to get going, go to work.
855522 858690 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
858775 860734 That's right.
860860 863570 - Running loaders and forklifts, that sort of thing?<br />- Yeah. So?
863655 866782 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
866866 869409 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
869494 871328 There's nothing wrong with it.
874585 877045 What would you say if I told you<br />I could get you reinstated...
877129 879088 as a flight officer?
879214 882576 The company's already agreed<br />to pick up your contract.
882676 883676 If I go.
883761 886721 Yeah, if you go.
886805 888973 Come on.<br />That's a second chance, kiddo.
889058 891809 I think, personally, for you,<br />it would be the best thing in the world...
891894 894771 to get out there and face this thing,<br />get back on the horse.
894855 897774 Spare me, Burke. I've had my<br />psych evaluation this month.
897900 901986 Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every night.<br />Your sheets are soaking with sweat--
902071 904322 I said no, and I mean it!
907117 909994 Now, please leave.<br />I am not going back.
910079 913414 And I am-- I would not be<br />any good to you if I did.
913499 916584 Okay. Shh.
918003 921506 Would you do me a favor?<br />Just think about it.
924593 926636 Thanks for the coffee.

984778 986696 <i>(Beeping)</i>
994705 996622 Hello.
996707 999417 Ripley.
999543 1003087 - You okay?<br />- Just tell me one thing, Burke.
1003172 1006466 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1006550 1011471 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1011555 1015600 That's the plan.<br />You have my word on it.
1018145 1019353 All right. I'm in.
1020782 1021365 I think that--
1029582 1031875 And you, you little shithead...
1031959 1034795 <i>(Chuckles)</i><br />you're staying here.

1119756 1123592 They ain't payin' us enough<br />for this, man.
1123676 1125844 Not enough to have to wake up<br />to your face, Drake.
1125928 1126595 What?
1128015 1129265 Is that a joke?
1129349 1131434 Oh, I wish it were.
1131518 1136439 Hey, Hicks. Man, you look<br />just like I feel. <i>(Grunts)</i>
1136523 1140401 All right, sweethearts.<br />What are you waiting for?
1140485 1143613 Breakfast in bed?<br />Another glorious day in the corps.
1143697 1147199 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm-
1147284 1152246 every meal's a banquet, every paycheck<br />a fortune, every formation a parade.
1152372 1154040 I love the corps!<br />Christ!
1154124 1155958 Man, this floor is freezing!
1156084 1158154 What do you want me to do?<br />Fetch your slippers for ya?
1158254 1160254 Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1160339 1163591 Look into my eye.<br />Fall in, people.
1163675 1165926 Come on. Let's go.
1166011 1167970 I hate this job.
1168096 1170765 Crowe, Wierzbowski. Come on. On your feet.<br />We got some slack coming, right?
1170849 1173726 You had three weeks on your back, Frost.<br />What do you want?
1173810 1176187 <i>(Frost) I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.</i>
1176271 1178564 <i>(Dietrich) Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?</i>
1181693 1185863 <i>(Apone) All right. First assembly's<br />in 15, people. Shag it.</i>
1187115 1189742 Hey, <i>mira.</i><br />Who's Snow White?
1189826 1193287 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1193372 1195623 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1195707 1198751 Whoopee-fuckin'-do!<br />Hey, I'm impressed.
1198835 1200878 <i>!Que bonita!</i>
1203215 1207343 Hey, Vasquez. Have you ever<br />been mistaken for a man?
1207427 1209470 No. Have you?
1209554 1214392 Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez.<br />You're just too bad.
1215102 1216811 Uhh!
1216895 1219188 <i>(Chattering)</i>
1225237 1227780 Hey, Top,  what's the op?
1227864 1229990 It's a rescue mission.<br />You'll love it.
1230075 1234787 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1234871 1237039 <i>(Spunkmeyer) Dumb-ass colonists.</i>
1239626 1243254 What's this crap supposed to be?<br />Vasquez.
1243380 1246465 Corn bread, I think.<br />It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1246550 1249552 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting some more<br />of that Arcturian poontang.
1249636 1254765 - Remember that time?<br />- Yeah. Except the one that you had was male.
1254850 1257435 Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.
1257561 1259979 Hey, Bishop, man. Do the thing<br />with the knife. Oh, please.
1260105 1262523 - Oh, come on. Yeah.<br />- <i>(All goading)</i>
1262607 1264567 All right! Yeah.

1268321 1271282 Hey, what are you doing, man?<br />What are you doing?
1271408 1273534 - Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />- Hudson, shut up !
1273618 1276203 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- <i>(Drake) Do it, Bishop!</i>
1276288 1279874 - Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!<br />- Yeah, you! Don't move.
1279958 1282251 Trust me.
1283545 1285463 Aahhhhh!
1293972 1296932 <i>(Apone) All right. Knock it off,<br />knock it off.</i>
1297017 1299018 - Thank you.<br />- <i>(Drake chuckles)</i>
1301480 1303481 There you go, short shit.<br />Enjoy your meal.
1303565 1306317 That wasn't funny, man.
1309863 1312990 Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?<br />Yeah, thanks.
1313074 1318245 Looks like the new lieutenant's too good<br />to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1319664 1322833 Boy's definitely got<br />a corncob up his ass.
1323919 1326629 <i>(Burke) Thought you<br />never miss, Bishop.</i>
1329925 1332718 You never said anything about an android<br />being on board. Why not?
1332803 1336847 <i>(Chuckles)</i> It never...<br />never occurred to me.
1336932 1340017 It's just common practice.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1340101 1342561 I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.
1342646 1344522 Right.
1344606 1347274 - Is there a problem?<br />- <i>(Burke) I'm sorry.</i>
1347359 1349276 I don't know why...<br />I didn't even--
1349361 1352780 Ripley's last trip out, the syn--<br />the artificial person malfunctioned.
1352864 1357743 - Malfunctioned?<br />- There were problems and a few deaths were involved.
1357828 1361038 I'm shocked.<br />Was it an older model?
1361122 1363791 The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1363875 1366460 That explains it then. The A2s<br />always were a bit twitchy.
1366545 1369255 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1369339 1373926 It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission<br />of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.
1374010 1378222 - You sure you don't want some?<br />- <i>(Clattering)</i>
1378306 1380891 You just stay away from me, Bishop.<br />You got that straight?
1383687 1387022 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1390944 1394029 <i>(Chattering)</i>
1400370 1404498 - <i>(Apone) Squad, ten-hut! Officer on deck!</i><br />- As you were.
1404583 1407418 Quickly, quickly.<br />Settle down.
1407502 1410504 All right.<br />Listen up!
1410589 1415634 Morning, marines. I'm sorry we didn't have time<br />to brief you people before we left Gateway--
1415760 1418220 - <i>(Hudson) Sir?</i><br />- What is it, Hicks?
1418305 1421390 Hudson, sir.<br />He's Hicks.
1421474 1424393 What's the question?
1424477 1428272 Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,<br />or another bug hunt?
1428356 1432443 All we know is that there's still<br />no contact with the colony...
1432527 1435362 and that a xenomorph<br />may be involved.
1435488 1438198 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
1438283 1440534 It's a bug hunt.
1440619 1445331 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
1445415 1447833 I'll tell you what I know.
1447918 1450336 We set down on LV-426.
1450420 1454423 One of our crew members was brought back on board<br />with something attached to his face,
1454507 1457009 some kind of parasite.
1457093 1459428 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
1459512 1462431 Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.
1462515 1465059 Kane seemed fine.
1465143 1467269 We were all having dinner,<br />and, um...
1467354 1471482 it must have laid something inside<br />his throat, some sort of embryo.
1471608 1475569 - He started-- um, he--<br />- <i>(Vasquez) Look, man.</i>
1475654 1480699 I only need to know one thing.<br />where they are.
1480825 1483577 - Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1483662 1488499 Right, right. Somebody said "alien."<br />She thought they said "illegal alien" and signed up.
1488625 1490584 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1490669 1493295 Are you finished?
1498468 1501178 I hope you're right.<br />I really do.
1503431 1506475 Yeah, okay, right.<br />Thank you, Ripley.
1506559 1509478 We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br />I suggest you study it.
1509604 1514483 Because just one of those things managed to<br />wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
1514567 1517319 And if the colonists have found that ship,<br />then there's no telling...
1517404 1519071 how many of them have been exposed.
1519155 1521573 Do you understand?
1523326 1526578 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so you better look at it.
1526663 1529331 Any questions?
1529416 1531792 What is it, Private?
1531876 1534878 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
1534963 1536714 You secure that shit, Hudson.

3017609 3022739 Nobody calls me Rebecca<br />except my brother.
3022823 3026701 Newt? I like that.
3026785 3030580 I'm Ripley.<br />It's nice to meet you.
3032583 3035668 And who is this, hmm?
3035794 3039505 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3039590 3042550 What about your brother?<br />What's his name?
3042634 3044677 Timmy.
3044762 3049223 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3052269 3054228 Any sisters?
3057858 3059776 Mom and dad?
3062613 3066866 Newt, look at me.<br />Where are they?
3066950 3069994 They're dead, all right?<br />Can I go now?
3073123 3075583 I'm sorry, Newt.
3075667 3078252 Don't you think you'd<br />be safer here with us?
3082132 3084175 These people are here to protect you.
3084259 3086219 They're soldiers.
3086303 3089138 It won't make any difference.

3121380 3126384 Yo! Stop your grinnin'<br />and drop your linen! Found 'em.
3126510 3129053 - They alive?<br />- Unknown,

3131139 3135309 Over at the processing station,<br />Sublevel 3,
3135394 3137854 under the main cooling towers.
3139064 3141691 Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
3141775 3143693 Let's saddle up, Apone.
3143777 3146070 Aye, sir.
3146154 3148739 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.

3150868 3152869 Okay, Frost, you're driving.
3164673 3168134 It's okay. Don't worry.<br />It'll be okay.

3242042 3245211 Nice and easy.<br />Check those corners.
3245295 3247546 Check those corners.
3250926 3253552 - Watch your spacing.<br />- <i>(Apone) All right. You heard the man.</i>
3253637 3255554 Don't bunch up.<br />Stay loose.
3255639 3258391 <i>(Gorman) Uh, your transmission's<br />showing a lot of breakup.</i>

3294970 3297054 What is that?
3297139 3299348 I don't know.

3345103 3347021 Looks like some sort<br />of secreted resin.
3347105 3350900 Yeah, but secreted from what?
3350984 3353652 Nobody touch nothing.
3353737 3356697 Busy little creatures, huh?
3356782 3359033 Hot as hell in here.
3359117 3361035 Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.
3361119 3363079 <i>(Apone) Knock it off, Hudson.</i>
3371004 3374340 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
3374424 3376801 Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
3376885 3378844 Standard light armor-piercing round.
3378929 3381180 - Why?<br />- Well, look where your team is.
3381264 3384517 They're right under the primary<br />heat exchangers.
3384601 3386602 So?
3386686 3390397 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
3390482 3394735 - Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.<br />- So? So what?
3394820 3399031 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
3399116 3401492 Right?
3401576 3406247 So you're talking about a thermonuclear explosion,<br />and <i>adios, muchachos.</i>

3422472 3426225 I, uh, I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
3426309 3430354 - Is he fuckin' crazy?<br />- What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?
3430438 3433274 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I--

3675558 3678894 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
3678978 3680896 Pull your team out, Gorman.

4147655 4151199 All right. We got 7 canisters of CN-20.
4151284 4154619 I say we roll them in there and<br />nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4154704 4157497 That's worth a try, but we don't<br />even know if it's gonna affect them.
4157582 4162043 Let's just bug out and call it even. Okay?<br />What are we talking about this for?
4162128 4165839 I say we take off and nuke<br />the entire site from orbit.

4186027 4189446 I know that. But let's not<br />make snap judgments, please.
4189530 4192490 This is clearly- clearly an<br />important species we're dealing with,
4192575 4195327 and I don't think that you or<br />I or anybody has the right...
4195411 4198496 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.

4225566 4227484 and Hicks is next<br />in chain of command.
4227568 4229736 Am I right, Corporal?
4229820 4231780 Yeah.
4232949 4235450 Yeah, that's right.
4235576 4237619 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4237703 4240163 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4240247 4242165 He can't make that kind of decision.
4242249 4244834 He's just a grunt.<br />Uh, no offense.
4244919 4248672 - None taken.<br />- Ferro, do you copy? Standing by.
4248756 4251424 Prep for dust off.<br />We're gonna need immediate evac.
4251509 4253426 Roger. On our way.
4253511 4258139 I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.<br />It's the only way to be sure.
4260768 4262519 Let's do it.
4262603 4266481 <i>(Wind whistling)</i>
4269610 4273154 Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson.<br />Pick it up, baby.
4278369 4280537 All right.<br />Set him down here.
4287128 4289170 Move it, Spunkmeyer.<br />We're rolling.
4294343 4296261 Hold on a second.<br />There's something--
4296345 4298638 <i>(Ferro) Just get up here.</i>
4298723 4301224 I'm in. Ramp closing.
4320953 4322912 Spunkmeyer.
4324123 4327792 - Goddamn it.<br />- <i>(Door opens)</i>
4327877 4330211 Well, where the fuck--
4330296 4332422 <i>(Hisses)</i>
4342975 4344893 Run!
4385768 4389562 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
4389647 4392107 Now what the fuck<br />are we supposed to do?
4392191 4394484 We're in some<br />real pretty shit now, man!
4394568 4396945 Are you finished?
4399782 4401741 You all right?
4406956 4411167 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
4411252 4412836 I'm sorry, Newt.
4412866 4415666 You don't have to be sorry.<br />It wasn't your fault.
4415692 4416811 That's it, man.
4416966 4419342 Game over, man! Game over!
4419426 4422053 What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br />What are we gonna do?
4422138 4426558 Maybe we could build a fire.<br />Sing a couple of songs? Why don't we try that?
4426642 4429394 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
4429478 4432856 and they mostly<br />come at night, mostly.
4449708 4453711 That's everything, right? All right.<br />This is absolutely everything...
4453795 4456797 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
4456881 4460426 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
4460510 4462678 That ain't so good.
4462762 4466432 We got, uh,<br />15 of these M-40 grenades.
4466516 4468475 Don't touch that.
4468601 4471061 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
4471146 4475190 <i>(Hicks) Yeah. It's only half full,<br />but it's functional.</i>
4475275 4479027 Got another one, it's damaged--<br />I don't know about that one.
4479779 4484199 How long after we're declared<br />overdue can we expect a rescue?
4486244 4488370 Seventeen days.
4489372 4491915 Seventeen days?
4492000 4495878 Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,<br />but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
4495962 4499590 Those things are gonna come in here like<br />they did before. They're gonna come in here--
4499620 4500691 Hudson! Hudson!
4500717 4502730 They're gonna come in here<br />and they're gonna get us!
4502886 4504928 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
4505013 4508056 with no weapons and no training.
4508141 4510058 Right?
4512437 4515147 Why don't you put her in charge?
4515231 4518066 You'd better just start dealing<br />with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
4518151 4520319 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
4520403 4522321 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
4522405 4525991 Now, I want you to get on a terminal and<br />call up some kind of floor plan file.
4526075 4528786 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
4528870 4531205 Anything that shows the layout of this place.<br />Are you listening?
4531331 4534416 - Yeah.<br />- I need to see air ducts.
4534501 4537878 I need to see electrical access<br />tunnels, subbasements,
4537962 4541632 every possible way<br />into this complex.
4541716 4546220 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
4546346 4548597 - Okay, I'm on it.<br />- Hudson!
4548681 4553393 - Just relax.<br />- <i>(Exhales sharply)</i>
4556815 4561819 I'll be in medlab. I'll check<br />on Gorman, continue my analysis.
4561903 4564863 Fine. You do that.
4571079 4574915 So this service tunnel must be<br />how they're moving back and forth.
4574999 4577501 That's right.<br />It moves from the processing station...
4577585 4579920 right into the sublevel here.
4581965 4585300 Come down on that.<br />Okay, come over.
4585385 4588595 Hold. Go back.<br />Okay, punch that in right there.
4594269 4596311 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
4597814 4600524 Well, there's a pressure door<br />at this end.
4600608 4604236 We could close that, weld it shut.<br />That should hold 'em for a while.
4604320 4606864 But we gotta figure on them<br />getting into the complex.
4606948 4611451 That's right, so we repair the barricades<br />at these two intersections.
4611578 4614121 - Right.<br />- And weld plate steel over these ducts..
4614205 4618125 here and here and here.
4618209 4621253 That should seal off<br />Medlab and Operations.
4621337 4624840 Outstanding. Now all we need<br />is a deck of cards.
4627135 4629219 All right, people.<br />Let's move like we got a purpose.
4629345 4632097 - <i>(Hudson) Affirmative.</i><br />- Affirmative.
4634517 4637978 We're sealing the tunnel.<br />Baby, hurry up. Come on.
4639981 4641815 <i>(Welder crackling)</i>
4650158 4652075 For what it's worth.
4654037 4656330 Here. I want you to put this on.
4657665 4659917 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
4660001 4663503 Then I can find you anywhere<br />in the complex on this.
4663588 4665213 <i>(Beeping)</i>
4665340 4669426 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.
4669510 4672304 Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
4672388 4674348 All right, what's next?
4686569 4689154 <i>(Door closes)</i>
4691658 4693700 Last stop.
4697705 4699623 Get in.
4699707 4703794 Scoot down. That's good.
4703878 4707923 Now, you lie here and have a nap.<br />You're very tired.
4708007 4711385 I don't want to.<br />I have scary dreams.
4713763 4716848 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
4716933 4718850 Let's take a look.
4718935 4721269 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
4721354 4725649 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
4725733 4728235 Ripley, she doesn't<br />have bad dreams...
4728319 4731363 because she's just a piece of plastic.
4731447 4734950 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
4741666 4743917 There.
4744002 4746878 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
4746963 4750298 no real ones...<br />but there are.
4751592 4753593 Yes, there are, aren't there?
4755680 4758015 Why do they tell little kids that?
4759892 4761810 Most of the time it's true.
4765314 4766231 Here.
4767609 4769443 Take this.
4770946 4772905 For luck.
4776118 4778077 There's that.
4780247 4782164 Don't go, please.
4782249 4785793 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
4785878 4787795 And you see that camera<br />right up there?
4787880 4790673 I can see you<br />right through that camera,
4790757 4793092 all the time<br />to see if you're safe.
4797472 4800141 I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.
4800225 4804145 I mean that.<br />That's a promise.
4804229 4806898 You promise?
4806982 4809275 I cross my heart.
4809359 4813654 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
4822623 4824582 <i>(Kisses)</i>
4828545 4833007 Now go to sleep,<br />and don't dream.
4834134 4836135 <i>(Laughs)</i>
4837179 4839138 Sneak.
4843977 4846479 <i>(Door Opens)</i>
4847908 4852203 The molecular acid oxidizes after the<br />creature's death, completely neutralizing it.
4852287 4855706 Bishop, you know, that's very interesting,<br />but it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?
4855791 4858334 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
4858418 4860503 Let's go through it again.
4860587 4862797 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there...
4862881 4867218 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
4867302 4871138 Which would mean that there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites, right?
4871223 4873391 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
4873475 4875393 Yes. That follows.
4875477 4879522 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
4882067 4883985 So who's Iaying these eggs?
4884069 4887154 I'm not sure.
4887239 4889407 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
4893871 4897206 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
4897291 4900585 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
4900669 4904130 that they were to be kept alive in stasis<br />for return to the company labs.
4906258 4908259 He was very specific about it.
4909647 4913650 Look. Those two specimens are worth<br />millions to the bio-weapons division, right?
4913734 4917111 Now, if you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
4917196 4920406 and we will be set up for life.
4921450 4924035 You're crazy, Burke.<br />Do you know that?
4924119 4928289 Do you really think you can get a dangerous<br />organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?
4928374 4931251 How can they impound it if<br />they don't know about it?
4931335 4934379 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
4934463 4938675 Just like they'll know that you were<br />responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.
4938801 4941219 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
4941345 4943429 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
4943514 4947392 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
4947476 4950395 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
4950521 4952939 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
4953023 4955525 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />Do you ever think about that?
4955609 4959279 I didn't know. So now if I went and made<br />a major security situation out of it,
4959405 4962782 everybody steps in, administration steps in,<br />and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.
4962866 4966911 Nobody wins. So I made a decision,<br />and it was wrong
4966996 4969706 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
4969832 4971499 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
4971583 4973209 These people are dead, Burke!
4973294 4975712 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
4975796 4978715 I'm gonna make sure that they nail<br />you right to the wall for this!
4978799 4981050 You're not gonna sleaze<br />your way out of this one.
4981135 4983303 Right to the wall.
4985139 4988234 Ripley. I--
4988319 4990320 You know, I expected more from you.
4990404 4993323 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
4993407 4996826 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5003923 5006717 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5006801 5010345 That's it. Emergency venting.
5010430 5015058 Oh, that's beautiful, man.<br />Oh, man, that- that just beats it all.
5015184 5018019 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5018146 5021189 <i>(Groans)</i><br />With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5021274 5024901 equal to about 40 megatons.
5024894 5025859 We got problems.
5025885 5028380 I don't believe this.<br />I don't fucking believe this.
5028573 5031074 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5031159 5033326 Why can't we shut it<br />down from here?
5033411 5035328 I'm sorry.<br />The crash caused too much damage.
5035413 5037956 An overload is inevitable<br />at this point.
5038040 5040959 Oh, man, and I was getting short.
5041043 5044379 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5044505 5046548 - It ain't half fair, man.<br />- Hudson, give us a break!
5046632 5049217 <i>(Hudson) Four more weeks.<br />Oh, man.</i>
5049302 5052512 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the <i>Sulaco.</i>
5052597 5055557 I mean, there must be some way<br />of bringing it down on remote.
5055641 5059144 How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C.<br />It's wasted.
5059270 5062481 I don't care how, but we'd better think<br />of something. We'd better think of a way.
5062607 5065442 - Think of what? We're fucked! We're doomed!<br />- Shut up!
5065526 5068320 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5068404 5071198 The uplink tower down at the other end.<br />Why can't we use that?
5071282 5074242 No, I checked. The hardware in<br />between here and there was damaged.
5074327 5076244 We can't align the dish.
5076329 5078747 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5078831 5081750 take a portable terminal,<br />go out there and patch in manually.
5081834 5086880 Yeah, sure. With those things running around?<br />You can count me out.
5087006 5089007 - Guess we can just count you out of everything.<br />- I'll go.
5089091 5090884 <i>(Hudson) That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?</i>
5091010 5092844 - <i>(Bishop) I'll go.</i><br />- What?
5092929 5097265 I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one qualified<br />to remote pilot the ship anyway.
5097350 5101728 Yeah, right, man.<br />Bishop should go. Good idea.
5101813 5103980 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
5104065 5106983 I may be synthetic,<br />but I'm not stupid.
5118746 5120664 <i>(Ripley) How long?</i>
5120748 5124000 This conduit runs almost to the<br />uplink assembly... 180 meters.
5124126 5127420 - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there--<br />- <i>(Ripley) Right.</i>
5127505 5131258 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
5132343 5134594 Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
5134720 5137931 - and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />- It's gonna be close.
5142436 5145146 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.

5205676 5208511 You'll take care of it, won't you?
5210097 5214642 If it comes to that,<br />I'll do us both.
5216353 5219063 Listen, let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that.
5219189 5222775 - All right?<br />- All right.
5222860 5228072 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
5228157 5232076 This is an M-41A pulse rifle,<br />10 millimeter,
5232161 5235997 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
5236081 5238041 Feel the weight.
5244965 5247258 Okay, what do I do?
5252681 5255308 - Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />- Right.
5255434 5257727 - Uh-huh. Lean into it.<br />- Mm-hmm.
5257811 5260480 All right.<br />Now, it will kick some.
5260564 5264108 All right. When the counter<br />reads zero here, you--

5268572 5271699 Get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
5271825 5274827 - Right.<br />- And you're ready to rock and roll.
5274953 5277747 - What's this?<br />- That's the grenade launcher.
5277831 5280583 I don't think you want<br />to mess with that.

5721858 5724110 Yes. The only way<br />he could do it...
5724194 5727947 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
5728031 5730616 Namely yours.
5730700 5734578 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.

5748510 5752847 It's really sad. It's pathetic.
5752931 5756725 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
5756810 5760104 You don't see them fucking each<br />other over for a goddamn percentage.
