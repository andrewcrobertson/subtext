306782 309784 Well, there goes our salvage, guys.
336228 339356 - How are we today?<br />- Ohh. Terrible.
339440 342317 Well, better than yesterday, at least.
342401 345153 - Where am I?<br />- You're safe.
345237 347655 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
347740 351159 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're okay.
351243 353745 Oh, looks like you've<br />got a visitor.
355623 357957 Jonesy. Come here.
359126 361252 Hey, come here.
361337 363713 How are you, you stupid cat?
363798 367717 How are you?<br />Where have you been?
367802 371638 Guess you two have met, huh?<br />I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
371722 376267 I work for the company, but don't let<br />that fool you. I'm really an okay guy.
377561 379479 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
379563 383108 They tell me that all the weakness<br />and disorientation should pass soon.
383234 389114 That's just natural side effects of such an<br />unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.
389198 391366 What do you mean?
391450 393827 How long was I out there?
393911 395995 <i>(Woman on P.A.)<br />Inhalation Therapy, report to...</i>
396080 398331 Has no one discussed<br />this with you yet?
398416 400417 No. But, I mean...
400501 404504 I don't...<br />recognize this place.
404588 406589 No, I know. Uh...
406674 410385 Okay. It's just that, uh,<br />this might be a shock to you.
410511 413096 - It's long--<br />- How long?
413180 415181 Please.
416183 420145 - 57 years.<br />- What?
420229 424482 That's the thing. You were<br />out there for 57 years.
424567 427694 What happened was you had drifted<br />right through the core systems.
427778 430613 And it's really just blind luck...
430698 433908 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
433993 436286 It's one in a thousand, really.
436370 441082 I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.<br />You could be floating out there forever.
441167 444377 You--you okay?
444462 447297 - <i>(Hisses)</i><br />- Uhh--
447381 450717 <i>(Heart pounding)</i>

513366 515451 - <i>(Meows)</i><br />- Shh.
519748 521749 It's all right.
522751 526545 - It's all right now.<br />- <i>(Purring)</i>
526630 528672 It's over.
531760 534011 <i>(Man #1) I'd just<br />like to go, uh...</i>
534095 536263 back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.
536389 539934 <i>(Man #2) Is it in the file?<br />I don't understand this.</i>
540018 542519 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
542604 544772 Now, how many different ways do you<br />want me to tell the same story?
546151 550779 Look at it from our perspective, please.
550864 552865 Please?
555285 557745 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
557829 560664 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class starfreighter,
560749 563208 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
563293 566503 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
566588 569339 That's minus payload, of course.
569424 573802 The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates<br />some elements of your account,
573887 578932 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
579017 583562 an unsurveyed pIanet at that time,<br />that it resumed its course...
583646 588567 and was subsequently set for self-destruct<br />by you for reasons unknown.
588651 590986 Not for reasons unknown.<br />I told you.
591112 596825 We set down there on company orders to get<br />this thing, which destroyed my crew...
596910 599369 and your expensive ship.
599454 603123 The analysis team, which went over<br />the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
603208 606335 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
606419 610464 Good! That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn air lock,
612133 614218 like I said.
615970 620557 Are there any species like this<br />hostile organism on LV-426?
620642 623143 No. It's a rock.<br />No indigenous life.
625146 628732 Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply<br />while I was away?
628817 631193 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
631277 634029 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
634113 638700 It was not from there. Do you get it?<br />We homed in on its beacon.
638785 641578 And found something<br />never recorded once...
641663 645165 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
645250 648545 "A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host."<br />95.5<br />00:10:50,045--> 00:10:51,045<br />Yes.
650129 654049 These are your words.<br />"And has concentrated acid for blood."
654133 656385 That's right.
656469 660389 Look. I can see where this is going,
660473 662891 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
663017 666186 - Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all.<br />- Please. You're not listening to me.
666271 668772 Kane, the crew member...
668857 672568 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
672694 674736 - Thousands.<br />- Thank you. That will be all.
674821 676864 Goddamn it, that's not all!
676948 680659 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
680743 683287 Then all of this- this bullshit<br />that you think is so important...
683371 687165 You can just kiss<br />all of that good-bye!
702606 704691 That could have been better.
704817 708278 - Look, I think the-- Ripley?<br />- Van Leuwen.
708362 711614 Why don't you just check out LV-426?
711699 715451 Because I don't have to. There have been<br />people there for over 20 years,
715577 717600 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
717700 720248 What do you mean? What people?
720332 723459 Terraformers.<br />Planet engineers.
723544 727255 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
727339 729632 Takes decades.
729717 731968 It's what we call a<br />"Shake 'N Bake" colony.
732052 735680 How many are there?<br />How many colonists?
735764 740268 I don't know... 60, maybe 70 families.<br />Do you mind?
742938 744939 "Families."
747192 749193 Jesus.

785822 788032 Hiya, Ripley.<br />This is Lieutenant Gorman...
788116 791243 of the Colonial Marine Corps--
791328 793579 Ripley, we have to talk.
793663 797374 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
803840 806050 I don't believe this.
806176 810721 You guys throw me at the wolves,<br />and now you want me to go back out there?
810805 813390 Forget it.<br />It's not my problem.
813516 817102 - Can I finish?<br />- No. There's no way.
818521 820606 Ripley, you wouldn't be going in<br />with the troops.
820690 823025 I can guarantee your safety.
823109 825611 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough <i>hombres.</i>
825695 828572 They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.
828657 829823 There's nothing they can't handle.
831248 833541 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- That's true.
833626 835794 We've been trained to deal<br />with situations like this.
835878 839506 Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
839632 842217 <i>(Burke) Yeah, but we don't know exactly<br />what's going on out there.</i>
842301 844886 It may just be<br />a downed transmitter, okay?
844970 849432 But if it's not, I would like<br />you there as an adviser,
849517 851434 and that's all.
851519 854437 Look, I don't have time for this.<br />I've got to get going, go to work.
854522 857690 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
857775 859734 That's right.
859860 862570 - Running loaders and forklifts, that sort of thing?<br />- Yeah. So?
862655 865782 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
865866 868409 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
868494 870328 There's nothing wrong with it.
873585 876045 What would you say if I told you<br />I could get you reinstated...
876129 878088 as a flight officer?
878214 881576 The company's already agreed<br />to pick up your contract.
881676 882676 If I go.
882761 885721 Yeah, if you go.
885805 887973 Come on.<br />That's a second chance, kiddo.
888058 890809 I think, personally, for you,<br />it would be the best thing in the world...
890894 893771 to get out there and face this thing,<br />get back on the horse.
893855 896774 Spare me, Burke. I've had my<br />psych evaluation this month.
896900 900986 Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every night.<br />Your sheets are soaking with sweat--
901071 903322 I said no, and I mean it!
906117 908994 Now, please leave.<br />I am not going back.
909079 912414 And I am-- I would not be<br />any good to you if I did.
912499 915584 Okay. Shh.
917003 920506 Would you do me a favor?<br />Just think about it.
923593 925636 Thanks for the coffee.

998543 1002087 - You okay?<br />- Just tell me one thing, Burke.
1002172 1005466 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1005550 1010471 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1010555 1014600 That's the plan.<br />You have my word on it.
1017145 1018353 All right. I'm in.
1019782 1020365 I think that--

1142697 1146199 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm-

1312074 1317245 Looks like the new lieutenant's too good<br />to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1318664 1321833 Boy's definitely got<br />a corncob up his ass.
1322919 1325629 <i>(Burke) Thought you<br />never miss, Bishop.</i>
1328925 1331718 You never said anything about an android<br />being on board. Why not?
1331803 1335847 <i>(Chuckles)</i> It never...<br />never occurred to me.
1335932 1339017 It's just common practice.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1339101 1341561 I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.
1341646 1343522 Right.
1343606 1346274 - Is there a problem?<br />- <i>(Burke) I'm sorry.</i>
1346359 1348276 I don't know why...<br />I didn't even--
1348361 1351780 Ripley's last trip out, the syn--<br />the artificial person malfunctioned.
1351864 1356743 - Malfunctioned?<br />- There were problems and a few deaths were involved.
1356828 1360038 I'm shocked.<br />Was it an older model?
1360122 1362791 The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1362875 1365460 That explains it then. The A2s<br />always were a bit twitchy.
1365545 1368255 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1368339 1372926 It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission<br />of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.
1373010 1377222 - You sure you don't want some?<br />- <i>(Clattering)</i>
1377306 1379891 You just stay away from me, Bishop.<br />You got that straight?

1406502 1409504 All right.<br />Listen up!
1409589 1414634 Morning, marines. I'm sorry we didn't have time<br />to brief you people before we left Gateway--
1414760 1417220 - <i>(Hudson) Sir?</i><br />- What is it, Hicks?
1417305 1420390 Hudson, sir.<br />He's Hicks.
1420474 1423393 What's the question?
1423477 1427272 Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,<br />or another bug hunt?
1427356 1431443 All we know is that there's still<br />no contact with the colony...
1431527 1434362 and that a xenomorph<br />may be involved.
1434488 1437198 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
1437283 1439534 It's a bug hunt.
1439619 1444331 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
1444415 1446833 I'll tell you what I know.
1446918 1449336 We set down on LV-426.
1449420 1453423 One of our crew members was brought back on board<br />with something attached to his face,
1453507 1456009 some kind of parasite.
1456093 1458428 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
1458512 1461431 Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.
1461515 1464059 Kane seemed fine.
1464143 1466269 We were all having dinner,<br />and, um...
1466354 1470482 it must have laid something inside<br />his throat, some sort of embryo.
1470608 1474569 - He started-- um, he--<br />- <i>(Vasquez) Look, man.</i>
1474654 1479699 I only need to know one thing.<br />where they are.
1479825 1482577 - Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1482662 1487499 Right, right. Somebody said "alien."<br />She thought they said "illegal alien" and signed up.
1487625 1489584 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1489669 1492295 Are you finished?
1497468 1500178 I hope you're right.<br />I really do.
1502431 1505475 Yeah, okay, right.<br />Thank you, Ripley.
1505559 1508478 We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br />I suggest you study it.
1508604 1513483 Because just one of those things managed to<br />wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
1513567 1516319 And if the colonists have found that ship,<br />then there's no telling...
1516404 1518071 how many of them have been exposed.
1518155 1520573 Do you understand?
1522326 1525578 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so you better look at it.
1525663 1528331 Any questions?
1528416 1530792 What is it, Private?
1530876 1533878 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
1533963 1535714 You secure that shit, Hudson.

3021823 3025701 Newt? I like that.
3025785 3029580 I'm Ripley.<br />It's nice to meet you.
3031583 3034668 And who is this, hmm?
3034794 3038505 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3038590 3041550 What about your brother?<br />What's his name?
3041634 3043677 Timmy.
3043762 3048223 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3051269 3053228 Any sisters?
3056858 3058776 Mom and dad?
3061613 3065866 Newt, look at me.<br />Where are they?
3065950 3068994 They're dead, all right?<br />Can I go now?
3072123 3074583 I'm sorry, Newt.
3074667 3077252 Don't you think you'd<br />be safer here with us?
3081132 3083175 These people are here to protect you.
3083259 3085219 They're soldiers.
3085303 3088138 It won't make any difference.

3120380 3125384 Yo! Stop your grinnin'<br />and drop your linen! Found 'em.

3130139 3134309 Over at the processing station,<br />Sublevel 3,
3134394 3136854 under the main cooling towers.
3138064 3140691 Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
3140775 3142693 Let's saddle up, Apone.
3142777 3145070 Aye, sir.
3145154 3147739 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.

3149868 3151869 Okay, Frost, you're driving.
3163673 3167134 It's okay. Don't worry.<br />It'll be okay.

3244295 3246546 Check those corners.
3249926 3252552 - Watch your spacing.<br />- <i>(Apone) All right. You heard the man.</i>
3252637 3254554 Don't bunch up.<br />Stay loose.

3344103 3346021 Looks like some sort<br />of secreted resin.
3346105 3349900 Yeah, but secreted from what?
3349984 3352652 Nobody touch nothing.
3352737 3355697 Busy little creatures, huh?
3355782 3358033 Hot as hell in here.
3358117 3360035 Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.
3360119 3362079 <i>(Apone) Knock it off, Hudson.</i>
3370004 3373340 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
3373424 3375801 Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
3375885 3377844 Standard light armor-piercing round.
3377929 3380180 - Why?<br />- Well, look where your team is.
3380264 3383517 They're right under the primary<br />heat exchangers.
3383601 3385602 So?
3385686 3389397 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
3389482 3393735 - Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.<br />- So? So what?
3393820 3398031 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
3398116 3400492 Right?
3400576 3405247 So you're talking about a thermonuclear explosion,<br />and <i>adios, muchachos.</i>

3421472 3425225 I, uh, I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
3425309 3429354 - Is he fuckin' crazy?<br />- What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?
3429438 3432274 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I--
3432358 3435318 Just do it, Sergeant.<br />And no grenades.

3674558 3677894 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
3677978 3679896 Pull your team out, Gorman.

4150284 4153619 I say we roll them in there and<br />nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4153704 4156497 That's worth a try, but we don't<br />even know if it's gonna affect them.
4156582 4161043 Let's just bug out and call it even. Okay?<br />What are we talking about this for?
4161128 4164839 I say we take off and nuke<br />the entire site from orbit.

4188530 4191490 This is clearly- clearly an<br />important species we're dealing with,
4191575 4194327 and I don't think that you or<br />I or anybody has the right...
4194411 4197496 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4197581 4199123 Yeah. Watch us.

4210427 4212511 I'm sorry.
4213639 4216557 Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...

4222105 4224482 This operation is under<br />military jurisdiction,
4224566 4226484 and Hicks is next<br />in chain of command.
4226568 4228736 Am I right, Corporal?
4228820 4230780 Yeah.
4231949 4234450 Yeah, that's right.
4234576 4236619 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4236703 4239163 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4239247 4241165 He can't make that kind of decision.
4241249 4243834 He's just a grunt.<br />Uh, no offense.
4243919 4247672 - None taken.<br />- Ferro, do you copy? Standing by.
4247756 4250424 Prep for dust off.<br />We're gonna need immediate evac.
4250509 4252426 Roger. On our way.
4252511 4257139 I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.<br />It's the only way to be sure.
4259768 4261519 Let's do it.
4261603 4265481 <i>(Wind whistling)</i>
4268610 4272154 Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson.<br />Pick it up, baby.
4277369 4279537 All right.<br />Set him down here.
4286128 4288170 Move it, Spunkmeyer.<br />We're rolling.
4293343 4295261 Hold on a second.<br />There's something--
4295345 4297638 <i>(Ferro) Just get up here.</i>
4297723 4300224 I'm in. Ramp closing.
4319953 4321912 Spunkmeyer.
4323123 4326792 - Goddamn it.<br />- <i>(Door opens)</i>
4326877 4329211 Well, where the fuck--
4329296 4331422 <i>(Hisses)</i>
4341975 4343893 Run!
4384768 4388562 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
4388647 4391107 Now what the fuck<br />are we supposed to do?
4391191 4393484 We're in some<br />real pretty shit now, man!
4393568 4395945 Are you finished?
4398782 4400741 You all right?
4405956 4410167 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
4410252 4411836 I'm sorry, Newt.
4411866 4414666 You don't have to be sorry.<br />It wasn't your fault.
4414692 4415811 That's it, man.
4415966 4418342 Game over, man! Game over!
4418426 4421053 What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br />What are we gonna do?
4421138 4425558 Maybe we could build a fire.<br />Sing a couple of songs? Why don't we try that?
4425642 4428394 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
4428478 4431856 and they mostly<br />come at night, mostly.
4448708 4452711 That's everything, right? All right.<br />This is absolutely everything...
4452795 4455797 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
4455881 4459426 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
4459510 4461678 That ain't so good.
4461762 4465432 We got, uh,<br />15 of these M-40 grenades.
4465516 4467475 Don't touch that.
4467601 4470061 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
4470146 4474190 <i>(Hicks) Yeah. It's only half full,<br />but it's functional.</i>
4474275 4478027 Got another one, it's damaged--<br />I don't know about that one.
4478779 4483199 How long after we're declared<br />overdue can we expect a rescue?
4485244 4487370 Seventeen days.
4488372 4490915 Seventeen days?
4491000 4494878 Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,<br />but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
4494962 4498590 Those things are gonna come in here like<br />they did before. They're gonna come in here--
4498620 4499691 Hudson! Hudson!
4499717 4501730 They're gonna come in here<br />and they're gonna get us!
4501886 4503928 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
4504013 4507056 with no weapons and no training.
4507141 4509058 Right?
4511437 4514147 Why don't you put her in charge?
4514231 4517066 You'd better just start dealing<br />with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
4517151 4519319 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
4519403 4521321 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
4521405 4524991 Now, I want you to get on a terminal and<br />call up some kind of floor plan file.
4525075 4527786 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
4527870 4530205 Anything that shows the layout of this place.<br />Are you listening?
4530331 4533416 - Yeah.<br />- I need to see air ducts.
4533501 4536878 I need to see electrical access<br />tunnels, subbasements,
4536962 4540632 every possible way<br />into this complex.
4540716 4545220 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
4545346 4547597 - Okay, I'm on it.<br />- Hudson!
4547681 4552393 - Just relax.<br />- <i>(Exhales sharply)</i>
4555815 4560819 I'll be in medlab. I'll check<br />on Gorman, continue my analysis.
4560903 4563863 Fine. You do that.
4570079 4573915 So this service tunnel must be<br />how they're moving back and forth.
4573999 4576501 That's right.<br />It moves from the processing station...
4576585 4578920 right into the sublevel here.
4580965 4584300 Come down on that.<br />Okay, come over.
4584385 4587595 Hold. Go back.<br />Okay, punch that in right there.
4593269 4595311 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
4596814 4599524 Well, there's a pressure door<br />at this end.
4599608 4603236 We could close that, weld it shut.<br />That should hold 'em for a while.
4603320 4605864 But we gotta figure on them<br />getting into the complex.
4605948 4610451 That's right, so we repair the barricades<br />at these two intersections.
4610578 4613121 - Right.<br />- And weld plate steel over these ducts..
4613205 4617125 here and here and here.
4617209 4620253 That should seal off<br />Medlab and Operations.
4620337 4623840 Outstanding. Now all we need<br />is a deck of cards.
4626135 4628219 All right, people.<br />Let's move like we got a purpose.
4628345 4631097 - <i>(Hudson) Affirmative.</i><br />- Affirmative.
4633517 4636978 We're sealing the tunnel.<br />Baby, hurry up. Come on.
4638981 4640815 <i>(Welder crackling)</i>
4649158 4651075 For what it's worth.
4653037 4655330 Here. I want you to put this on.
4656665 4658917 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
4659001 4662503 Then I can find you anywhere<br />in the complex on this.
4662588 4664213 <i>(Beeping)</i>
4664340 4668426 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.
4668510 4671304 Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
4671388 4673348 All right, what's next?
4685569 4688154 <i>(Door closes)</i>
4690658 4692700 Last stop.
4696705 4698623 Get in.
4698707 4702794 Scoot down. That's good.
4702878 4706923 Now, you lie here and have a nap.<br />You're very tired.
4707007 4710385 I don't want to.<br />I have scary dreams.
4712763 4715848 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
4715933 4717850 Let's take a look.
4717935 4720269 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
4720354 4724649 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
4724733 4727235 Ripley, she doesn't<br />have bad dreams...
4727319 4730363 because she's just a piece of plastic.
4730447 4733950 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
4740666 4742917 There.
4743002 4745878 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
4745963 4749298 no real ones...<br />but there are.
4750592 4752593 Yes, there are, aren't there?
4754680 4757015 Why do they tell little kids that?
4758892 4760810 Most of the time it's true.
4764314 4765231 Here.
4766609 4768443 Take this.
4769946 4771905 For luck.
4775118 4777077 There's that.
4779247 4781164 Don't go, please.
4781249 4784793 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
4784878 4786795 And you see that camera<br />right up there?
4786880 4789673 I can see you<br />right through that camera,
4789757 4792092 all the time<br />to see if you're safe.
4796472 4799141 I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.
4799225 4803145 I mean that.<br />That's a promise.
4803229 4805898 You promise?
4805982 4808275 I cross my heart.
4808359 4812654 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
4821623 4823582 <i>(Kisses)</i>
4827545 4832007 Now go to sleep,<br />and don't dream.
4833134 4835135 <i>(Laughs)</i>
4836179 4838138 Sneak.
4842977 4845479 <i>(Door Opens)</i>
4846908 4851203 The molecular acid oxidizes after the<br />creature's death, completely neutralizing it.
4851287 4854706 Bishop, you know, that's very interesting,<br />but it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?
4854791 4857334 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
4857418 4859503 Let's go through it again.
4859587 4861797 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there...
4861881 4866218 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
4866302 4870138 Which would mean that there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites, right?
4870223 4872391 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
4872475 4874393 Yes. That follows.
4874477 4878522 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
4881067 4882985 So who's Iaying these eggs?
4883069 4886154 I'm not sure.
4886239 4888407 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
4892871 4896206 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
4896291 4899585 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
4899669 4903130 that they were to be kept alive in stasis<br />for return to the company labs.
4905258 4907259 He was very specific about it.
4908647 4912650 Look. Those two specimens are worth<br />millions to the bio-weapons division, right?
4912734 4916111 Now, if you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
4916196 4919406 and we will be set up for life.
4920450 4923035 You're crazy, Burke.<br />Do you know that?
4923119 4927289 Do you really think you can get a dangerous<br />organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?
4927374 4930251 How can they impound it if<br />they don't know about it?
4930335 4933379 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
4933463 4937675 Just like they'll know that you were<br />responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.
4937801 4940219 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
4940345 4942429 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
4942514 4946392 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
4946476 4949395 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
4949521 4951939 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
4952023 4954525 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />Do you ever think about that?
4954609 4958279 I didn't know. So now if I went and made<br />a major security situation out of it,
4958405 4961782 everybody steps in, administration steps in,<br />and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.
4961866 4965911 Nobody wins. So I made a decision,<br />and it was wrong
4965996 4968706 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
4968832 4970499 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
4970583 4972209 These people are dead, Burke!
4972294 4974712 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
4974796 4977715 I'm gonna make sure that they nail<br />you right to the wall for this!
4977799 4980050 You're not gonna sleaze<br />your way out of this one.
4980135 4982303 Right to the wall.
4984139 4987234 Ripley. I--
4987319 4989320 You know, I expected more from you.
4989404 4992323 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
4992407 4995826 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5002923 5005717 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5005801 5009345 That's it. Emergency venting.
5009430 5014058 Oh, that's beautiful, man.<br />Oh, man, that- that just beats it all.
5014184 5017019 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5017146 5020189 <i>(Groans)</i><br />With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5020274 5023901 equal to about 40 megatons.
5023894 5024859 We got problems.
5024885 5027380 I don't believe this.<br />I don't fucking believe this.
5027573 5030074 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5030159 5032326 Why can't we shut it<br />down from here?
5032411 5034328 I'm sorry.<br />The crash caused too much damage.
5034413 5036956 An overload is inevitable<br />at this point.
5037040 5039959 Oh, man, and I was getting short.
5040043 5043379 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5043505 5045548 - It ain't half fair, man.<br />- Hudson, give us a break!
5045632 5048217 <i>(Hudson) Four more weeks.<br />Oh, man.</i>
5048302 5051512 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the <i>Sulaco.</i>
5051597 5054557 I mean, there must be some way<br />of bringing it down on remote.
5054641 5058144 How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C.<br />It's wasted.
5058270 5061481 I don't care how, but we'd better think<br />of something. We'd better think of a way.
5061607 5064442 - Think of what? We're fucked! We're doomed!<br />- Shut up!
5064526 5067320 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5067404 5070198 The uplink tower down at the other end.<br />Why can't we use that?
5070282 5073242 No, I checked. The hardware in<br />between here and there was damaged.
5073327 5075244 We can't align the dish.
5075329 5077747 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5077831 5080750 take a portable terminal,<br />go out there and patch in manually.
5080834 5085880 Yeah, sure. With those things running around?<br />You can count me out.
5086006 5088007 - Guess we can just count you out of everything.<br />- I'll go.
5088091 5089884 <i>(Hudson) That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?</i>
5090010 5091844 - <i>(Bishop) I'll go.</i><br />- What?
5091929 5096265 I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one qualified<br />to remote pilot the ship anyway.
5096350 5100728 Yeah, right, man.<br />Bishop should go. Good idea.
5100813 5102980 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
5103065 5105983 I may be synthetic,<br />but I'm not stupid.
5117746 5119664 <i>(Ripley) How long?</i>
5119748 5123000 This conduit runs almost to the<br />uplink assembly... 180 meters.
5123126 5126420 - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there--<br />- <i>(Ripley) Right.</i>
5126505 5130258 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
5131343 5133594 Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
5133720 5136931 - and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />- It's gonna be close.
5141436 5144146 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.

5182483 5184609 All right. <i>Vámonos.</i>
5195500 5197501 How long's it been<br />since you got any sleep?
5197586 5201213 Twenty-four hours?
5201298 5204592 Hicks, I'm not gonna end<br />up like those others.
5204676 5207511 You'll take care of it, won't you?
5209097 5213642 If it comes to that,<br />I'll do us both.
5215353 5218063 Listen, let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that.
5218189 5221775 - All right?<br />- All right.
5221860 5227072 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
5227157 5231076 This is an M-41A pulse rifle,<br />10 millimeter,
5231161 5234997 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
5235081 5237041 Feel the weight.
5243965 5246258 Okay, what do I do?
5251681 5254308 - Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />- Right.
5254434 5256727 - Uh-huh. Lean into it.<br />- Mm-hmm.
5256811 5259480 All right.<br />Now, it will kick some.
5259564 5263108 All right. When the counter<br />reads zero here, you--
5263234 5265486 - I press this up?<br />- That's right.
5267572 5270699 Get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
5270825 5273827 - Right.<br />- And you're ready to rock and roll.
5273953 5276747 - What's this?<br />- That's the grenade launcher.
5276831 5279583 I don't think you want<br />to mess with that.
5279668 5283671 You started this.<br />Show me everything.
5283755 5285714 I can handle myself.

5299396 5301355 How do you feel?
5301439 5304942 All right, I guess.<br />One hell of a hangover.

5718815 5720774 Wait a minute, now.<br />We'd all know.
5720858 5723110 Yes. The only way<br />he could do it...
5723194 5726947 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
5727031 5729616 Namely yours.
5729700 5733578 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.

5747510 5751847 It's really sad. It's pathetic.
5751931 5755725 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
5755810 5759104 You don't see them fucking each<br />other over for a goddamn percentage.
