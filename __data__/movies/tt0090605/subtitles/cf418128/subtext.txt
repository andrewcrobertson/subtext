299717 304263 Bio readouts are all in the green.<br />Looks like she's alive.
306765 309768 Well, there goes our salvage, guys.
336211 339340 - How are we today?<br />- Terrible.
339423 342301 Well, better than yesterday, at least.
342384 345137 - Where am I?<br />- You're safe.
345220 347639 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
347723 351143 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're okay.
351226 353729 Oh, looks like you've got a visitor.
355606 357941 Jonesy. Come here.
359109 361236 Hey, come here.
361320 363697 How are you, you stupid cat?
363781 367701 How are you?<br />Where have you been?
367785 371622 Guess you two have met, huh?<br />I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
371705 373374 I work for the company,
373457 376251 but don't let that fool you.<br />I'm really an okay guy.
377544 379463 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
379546 383133 They tell me that all the weakness and<br />disorientation should pass soon.
383217 387596 That's just natural side effects<br />of such an unusually long hypersleep,
387679 389098 or something like that.
389181 391350 What do you mean?
391433 393811 How long was I out there?
393894 395979 Inhalation Therapy, report to...
396063 398315 Has no one discussed this with you yet?
398399 400401 No. But, I mean...
400484 404488 I don't recognize this place.
404571 406573 No, I know...
406657 410411 Okay. It's just that<br />this might be a shock to you.
410494 413080 - It's long...<br />- How long?
413163 415165 Please.
416166 420129 - 57 years.<br />- What?
420212 424466 That's the thing.<br />You were out there for 57 years.
424550 427678 What happened was you had drifted<br />right through the core systems.
427761 430597 And it's really just blind luck...
430681 433892 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
433976 436270 It's one in a thousand really.
436353 438814 I think you're damn lucky<br />to be alive, kiddo.
438897 441066 You could be floating out there forever.
441150 444361 You... You okay?
453620 455873 You okay?
460419 465215 Oh, God!
466633 470220 - Nurse! Please!<br />- God!
470304 473265 Someone get in here now!
473348 475392 Now!
475476 477686 - Hold!<br />- Please.
477769 479980 Hold on!
480063 482065 Kill me!
489740 491575 No!
491658 493660 No!
499458 502586 Bad dreams again?<br />You want something to help you sleep?
502669 504922 No.
505005 507007 I've slept enough.
508967 511178 Jonesy.
511261 513263 Come here.
519728 521730 It's all right.
522731 526526 It's all right now.
526610 528654 It's over.
531406 533992 I'd just like to go...
534076 536286 back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.
536370 539915 - Is it in the file?<br />- I don't understand this.
539998 542501 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
542584 545879 Now, how many different ways<br />do you want me to tell the same story?
546171 550759 Look at it from our perspective,<br />please.
550842 552844 Please?
555264 557724 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
557808 560644 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class starfreighter,
560727 563188 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
563272 566483 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
566566 569319 That's minus payload, of course.
569403 571154 The lifeboat's flight recorder
571238 573782 corroborates some elements<br />of your account,
573865 578912 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
578996 583542 an unsurveyed planet at that time,<br />that it resumed its course...
583625 587004 and was subsequently set for<br />self-destruct by you
587087 588547 for reasons unknown.
588630 591008 Not for reasons unknown.<br />I told you.
591091 594303 We set down there on company orders<br />to get this thing,
594386 596805 which destroyed my crew...
596888 599349 and your expensive ship.
599433 603103 The analysis team, which went over the<br />lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
603186 606315 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
606398 610444 Good! That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn air lock,
612112 614197 like I said.
615949 620537 Are there any species<br />like this hostile organism on LV-426?
620620 623123 No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.
625125 628712 Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply<br />while I was away?
628795 631173 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
631256 634009 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
634092 638680 It was not from there. Do you get it?<br />We homed in on its beacon.
638764 641558 And found something<br />never recorded once...
641641 645145 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
645228 649107 A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host.
649191 650025 Yes.
650108 654029 These are your words.<br />And has concentrated acid for blood.
654112 656365 That's right.
656448 660369 Look.<br />I can see where this is going,
660452 662913 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
662996 664706 Thank you, Officer Ripley.<br />That will be all.
664790 666166 Please. You're not listening to me.
666249 668752 Kane, the crew member...
668835 672589 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
672672 674716 - Thousands.<br />- Thank you. That will be all.
674800 676843 Goddamn it, that's not all!
676927 680639 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
680722 683266 Then all of this... this bullshit that you<br />think is so important...
683350 687145 You can just kiss all of that good-bye!
702577 704704 That could have been better.
704788 708250 - Look, I think the... Ripley?<br />- Van Leuwen.
708333 711586 Why don't you just check out LV-426?
711670 715465 Because I don't have to. There have been<br />people there for over 20 years,
715549 718426 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
718510 720220 What do you mean? What people?
720303 723431 Terraformers. Planet engineers.
723515 727227 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
727310 729604 Takes decades.
729688 731940 It's what we call<br />a Shake 'N Bake colony.
732023 735652 How many are there?<br />How many colonists?
735735 740240 I don't know...<br />60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?
742909 744911 Families.
747164 749166 Jesus.
785785 787996 Hiya, Ripley.<br />This is Lieutenant Gorman...
788079 791208 of the Colonial Marine Corps.
791291 793543 Ripley, we have to talk.
793627 797339 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
803803 806056 I don't believe this.
806139 810685 You guys throw me at the wolves, and now<br />you want me to go back out there?
810769 813396 Forget it. It's not my problem.
813480 817067 - Can I finish?<br />- No. There's no way.
818485 820570 Ripley, you wouldn't<br />be going in with the troops.
820654 822989 I can guarantee your safety.
823073 825575 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough hombres.
825659 828536 They're packing<br />state-of-the-art firepower.
828620 829788 There's nothing they can't handle.
831206 833500 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- That's true.
833583 835752 We've been trained<br />to deal with situations like this.
835835 839506 Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
839589 842175 Yeah, but we don't know<br />exactly what's going on out there.
842259 844844 It may just be a downed transmitter,<br />okay?
844928 849391 But if it's not,<br />I would like you there as an adviser,
849474 851393 and that's all.
851476 854396 Look, I don't have time for this.<br />I've got to get going, go to work.
854479 857649 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
857732 859734 That's right.
859818 861778 Running loaders and forklifts,<br />that sort of thing?
861861 862696 Yeah. So?
862779 865740 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
865824 868368 And I know it's the only thing<br />that you could get.
868451 870287 There's nothing wrong with it.
873498 875959 What would you say if I told you I could<br />get you reinstated...
876042 878044 as a flight officer?
878128 881715 The company's already agreed<br />to pick up your contract.
881798 882590 If I go.
882674 885635 Yeah, if you go.
885719 887887 Come on.<br />That's a second chance, kiddo.
887971 889431 I think, personally, for you,
889514 890890 it would be the best thing<br />in the world...
890974 893685 to get out there and face this thing,<br />get back on the horse.
893768 896730 Spare me, Burke.<br />I've had my psych evaluation this month.
896813 898064 Yeah, I know. I've read it.
898148 900900 You wake up every night.<br />Your sheets are soaking with sweat...
900984 903236 I said no, and I mean it!
906031 908908 Now, please leave.<br />I am not going back.
908992 912328 And I am... I would not be<br />any good to you if I did.
912412 915498 Okay.
916916 920420 Would you do me a favor?<br />Just think about it.
923506 925550 Thanks for the coffee.
993618 995537 Hello.
995620 998373 Ripley.
998456 1002001 - You okay?<br />- Just tell me one thing, Burke.
1002085 1005380 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1005463 1010385 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1010468 1014514 That's the plan.<br />You have my word on it.
1017058 1018268 All right. I'm in.
1019727 1020562 I think that...
1028528 1030822 And you, you little shithead,
1030905 1033741 you're staying here.
1118701 1122538 They ain't payin' us enough<br />for this, man.
1122622 1125792 Not enough to have to wake up<br />to your face, Drake.
1125875 1126709 What?
1127001 1128211 Is that a joke?
1128294 1130380 Oh, I wish it were.
1130463 1135385 Hey, Hicks. Man, you look<br />just like I feel.
1136427 1139347 All right, sweethearts.<br />What are you waiting for?
1139430 1142558 Breakfast in bed?<br />Another glorious day in the corps.
1142642 1146145 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm...
1146229 1151234 every meal's a banquet, every paycheck a<br />fortune, every formation a parade.
1151317 1152986 - I love the corps!<br />- Christ!
1153069 1154946 Man, this floor is freezing!
1155029 1157532 What do you want me to do?<br />Fetch your slippers for ya?
1157615 1159200 Gee, would you, sir?<br />I'd like that.
1159284 1162537 Look into my eye.<br />Fall in, people.
1162620 1164872 Come on. Let's go.
1164956 1166958 I hate this job.
1167041 1168543 Crowe, Wierzbowski.<br />Come on. On your feet.
1168626 1169711 We got some slack coming, right?
1169794 1172672 You had three weeks on your back, Frost.<br />What do you want?
1172755 1175133 I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.
1175216 1177510 Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?
1180638 1184809 All right. First assembly's<br />in 15, people. Shag it.
1186060 1188688 Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?
1188771 1192233 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1192317 1194569 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1194652 1197697 Whoopee-fuckin'-do!<br />Hey, I'm impressed.
1197780 1199824 Que bonita!
1202160 1206289 Hey, Vasquez.<br />Have you ever been mistaken for a man?
1206372 1208416 No. Have you?
1208499 1213338 Oh, Vasquez.<br />You're just too bad.
1224182 1226726 Hey, Top, what's the op?
1226809 1228936 It's a rescue mission.<br />You'll love it.
1229020 1233733 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1233816 1235985 Dumb-ass colonists.
1238571 1242241 - What's this crap supposed to be?<br />- Vasquez.
1242325 1245411 - Corn bread, I think.<br />- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1245495 1248498 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting<br />some more of that Arcturian poontang.
1248581 1250208 Remember that time?
1250291 1253711 Yeah. Except the one<br />that you had was male.
1253795 1256422 Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.
1256506 1258091 Hey, Bishop, man.<br />Do the thing with the knife.
1258174 1258966 Oh, please.
1259050 1261469 Oh, come on. Yeah.
1261552 1263513 All right! Yeah.
1263596 1267183 - I don't want to see that, man.<br />- Come on, man. All right. All right.
1267266 1270269 Hey, what are you doing, man?<br />What are you doing?
1270353 1272480 - Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />- Hudson, shut up!
1272563 1275149 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- Do it, Bishop!
1275233 1278820 - Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!<br />- Yeah, you! Don't move.
1278903 1281197 Trust me.
1292917 1295878 All right.<br />Knock it off, knock it off.
1295962 1297964 Thank you.
1300425 1302427 - There you go, short shit.<br />- Enjoy your meal.
1302510 1305263 That wasn't funny, man.
1308808 1311936 - Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1312019 1317191 Looks like the new lieutenant's too good<br />to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1318609 1321779 Boy's definitely got a corncob<br />up his ass.
1322864 1325575 Thought you never miss, Bishop.
1328870 1331664 You never said anything about<br />an android being on board. Why not?
1331747 1335793 It never... never occurred to me.
1335877 1338963 It's just common practice.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1339046 1341507 I prefer the term<br />artificial person myself.
1341591 1343468 Right.
1343551 1346220 - Is there a problem?<br />- I'm sorry.
1346304 1348222 I don't know why I didn't even...
1348306 1351726 Ripley's last trip out, the syn...<br />the artificial person malfunctioned.
1351809 1352810 Malfunctioned?
1352894 1356689 There were problems<br />and a few deaths were involved.
1356772 1359984 I'm shocked.<br />Was it an older model?
1360067 1362737 The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1362820 1365406 That explains it then.<br />The A2s always were a bit twitchy.
1365490 1368201 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1368284 1369827 It is impossible for me to harm,
1369911 1372872 or by omission of action,<br />allow to be harmed, a human being.
1372955 1377168 You sure you don't want some?
1377251 1379837 You just stay away from me, Bishop.<br />You got that straight?
1382632 1385885 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread either.
1399315 1402401 Squad, ten-hut!<br />Officer on deck!
1402485 1403444 As you were.
1403528 1406364 Quickly, quickly. Settle down.
1406447 1409450 All right. Listen up!
1409534 1410493 Morning, marines.
1410576 1414622 I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief<br />you people before we left Gateway...
1414705 1417166 - Sir?<br />- What is it, Hicks?
1417250 1420336 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
1420419 1423339 What's the question?
1423422 1427218 Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,<br />or another bug hunt?
1427301 1431389 All we know is that there's still no<br />contact with the colony...
1431472 1434350 and that a xenomorph may be involved.
1434433 1437144 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
1437228 1439480 It's a bug hunt.
1439564 1444277 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
1444360 1446779 I'll tell you what I know.
1446862 1449282 We set down on LV-426.
1449365 1451659 One of our crew members<br />was brought back on board
1451742 1453369 with something attached to his face,
1453452 1455955 some kind of parasite.
1456038 1458374 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
1458457 1461377 Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.
1461460 1464005 Kane seemed fine.
1464088 1466215 We were all having dinner, and...
1466299 1470469 it must have laid something<br />inside his throat, some sort of embryo.
1470553 1474515 - He started... He...<br />- Look, man.
1474599 1479687 I only need to know one thing,<br />where they are.
1479770 1482523 - Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1482607 1484525 Right, right. Somebody said alien.
1484609 1487486 She thought they said<br />illegal alien and signed up.
1487570 1489530 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
1489614 1492241 Are you finished?
1497413 1500124 I hope you're right.<br />I really do.
1502376 1505421 Yeah, okay, right.<br />Thank you, Ripley.
1505504 1508466 We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br />I suggest you study it.
1508549 1510259 Because just one of those things
1510343 1513429 managed to wipe out my entire crew<br />in less than 24 hours.
1513512 1516265 And if the colonists have found<br />that ship, then there's no telling...
1516349 1518017 how many of them have been exposed.
1518100 1520519 Do you understand?
1522271 1525524 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so you better look at it.
1525608 1528277 Any questions?
1528361 1530738 What is it, Private?
1530821 1533824 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
1533908 1535660 You secure that shit, Hudson.
1538329 1540414 All right.
1540498 1543334 Now listen up.
1544710 1546837 I want this thing to go smooth...
1546921 1549465 and by the numbers.
1549548 1554011 I want D.C.S. and tactical database<br />assimilation by 0830.
1555012 1557098 Ordinance loading, weapons strip<br />and drop-ship prep details...
1557181 1559558 - will have seven hours.<br />- Oh, come on.
1559642 1561811 Now, move it, people!
1561894 1562895 All right, sweethearts.
1562978 1564605 You heard the man,<br />and you know the drill.
1564689 1568859 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
1584125 1586127 I don't care if you are short, Hudson.<br />Get it done.
1586210 1588796 Hey, Sarge.<br />You'll get lip cancer smoking those.
1588879 1592049 Corporal, I want<br />this loading lock sealed. Now!
1592133 1594552 - How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?<br />- Last one.
1594635 1596679 Good. Take it away.
1614113 1616198 Clear behind.
1622371 1624999 Did you check number three?<br />Let me see that.
1625082 1629003 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
1629086 1631464 I don't know.<br />Is there anything you can do?
1634425 1636677 Well, I can drive that loader.
1636761 1640431 I have a Class 2 rating.
1640514 1642600 Be my guest.
1688145 1692066 Where you want it?
1692149 1695528 Bay 12, please.
1751959 1753502 All right, sweethearts.<br />We're a team,
1753586 1755421 and there's nothing to worry about.
1755504 1759049 We come here, and we gonna conquer,<br />and we gonna kick some.
1759133 1761135 Is that understood?<br />That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
1761218 1762011 Yes, sir.
1762094 1764430 - We are going to go and get some.<br />- Hey.
1764513 1767308 All right, people! On the ready line!
1767391 1770185 - Are you lean? Are you mean?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
1770269 1772897 - What are you? What are you?<br />- Lean and mean!
1772980 1775774 Hudson!<br />Get on the ready line, marine!
1775858 1778819 Get some today! Get on the ready line!
1778903 1781822 - Yo!<br />- Move it out! Move it out, goddamn it!
1781906 1785492 Get hot! One, two, three!<br />Get out, get out, get out!
1785576 1789121 Move it out, move it out, move it out!<br />Move it out, move it out, move it out!
1791874 1795502 Absolutely badasses.
1795586 1798005 Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!
1798088 1800090 All right! Move it!
1800174 1802843 - Let's go, let's go!<br />- One, two, three,
1802927 1806388 four, five, six!
1806472 1810851 All right. I want combat seating.<br />You know your places.
1810935 1813228 Get those weapons stowed.<br />Let's go.
1813312 1816649 Come on. Settle down, people.
1816732 1818859 Lock 'em in, Hudson.
1818943 1822321 - Ready to get it on?<br />- You know it!
1822404 1825074 Okay, Bishop, let's go.
1825157 1827326 Roger.
1829119 1831872 I'm ready, man.
1831956 1835459 Ready to get it on! Go!
1839588 1842049 Stand by. Cross-locking now.
1842132 1843592 Prelaunch autocycle engaged.
1846845 1850849 Primary couplers released.<br />Hit the internals.
1862403 1863237 Shit, man.
1863320 1865114 Confirm cross-lock<br />and drop stations secured.
1865197 1869326 Affirmative.<br />All drop stations secured.
1872997 1875541 Stand by. Ten seconds.
1878168 1882214 Stand by to initiate<br />release sequencer on my mark.
1882297 1883590 Five, four, three...
1883674 1886969 We're on an express elevator<br />to hell, going down.
1887052 1890014 Two, one, mark.
1905821 1907865 Switch to D.C.S. ranging.
1908449 1910200 240, nominal to profile.
1910284 1912995 We're in the pipe, five by five.
1923714 1925883 We're picking up some hull ionization.
1925966 1928427 Got it. Rough air ahead.
1928510 1930763 We're in for some chop.
1944401 1946737 How many drops is this<br />for you, Lieutenant?
1949073 1951492 Thirty-eight.
1951575 1953535 Simulated.
1953619 1955746 How many combat drops?
1955829 1959875 Two... including this one.
1959958 1963295 - Shit.<br />- Oh, man!
1975974 1980187 Range 014. Turning on final.
1985067 1987945 And I'm telling you,<br />I got a bad feeling about this drop.
1988028 1989363 You always say that, Frost.
1989446 1991448 You always say,<br />I got a bad feeling about this drop.
1991532 1993992 Okay, okay.<br />When we get back without you,
1994076 1997079 I'll call your folks.
1999331 2003460 All right.<br />Let's see what we can see.
2003544 2007005 Everybody online. Looking good.
2008841 2011135 Drake, check your camera.<br />There seems to be a malfunction.
2012553 2015806 That's better.<br />Pan it around a bit.
2015889 2019810 - Good.<br />- All right, gear up.
2019893 2023689 Two minutes, people. Get hot.
2023772 2025482 Somebody wake up Hicks.
2039037 2041498 Coming around for a 709er.
2041582 2044418 - Terminal guidance locked in.<br />- Where's the damn beacon?
2044501 2047045 Oh, I see it.
2053176 2056471 - That's the atmosphere processor?<br />- Yep, that's it.
2056555 2059850 Remarkable piece of machinery.<br />Completely automated.
2059933 2062477 You know,<br />we manufacture those, by the way.
2072154 2077284 Okay, Ferro. Take us in low<br />over the main colony complex.
2079036 2081163 Storm shutters are sealed.
2081246 2084917 There's no visible activity.<br />All right. Hold at 40.
2085208 2088045 - Roger.<br />- Give me a slow circle of the complex.
2095928 2100265 Structure seems intact.<br />They still have power.
2100349 2104561 Okay, Ferro.<br />Set down on the landing grid.
2104645 2107522 Immediate dust off on my clear,<br />then stay on station.
2121578 2123914 Down and clear.
2125082 2127250 Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.
2130295 2133632 All right. I want a nice,<br />clean dispersal this time.
2135300 2137386 Let's go! Move it out!
2137469 2139471 Head 'em up!
2160367 2164579 First squad up on line. Hicks, get yours<br />in accord and watch the rear.
2164663 2168291 Vasquez, take point. Let's move!
2175674 2177634 Move up.
2179511 2182597 Hudson, run a bypass.
2188020 2190939 Second squad, move up.<br />Flanking positions.
2191023 2193734 Second squad on line.
2221762 2223847 You set?
2226892 2228894 Go on.
2254336 2257255 Second team, move inside.<br />Hicks, take the upper level.
2285283 2290288 Sir, you copying this? Looks<br />like hits from small-arms fire.
2290372 2293458 We got some explosives damage.
2293542 2295794 It's probably seismic survey charges.
2295877 2299673 Are you reading this?<br />Keep it tight, people.
2312936 2316898 All right. Hicks, Hudson,<br />use your motion trackers.
2334708 2338044 Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
2342966 2345802 Quarter and search by twos.
2357230 2360192 Okay. Dietrich, Frost, you're up.
2398146 2401107 Wait. Wait, tell him to...
2402108 2405820 Hicks, back up. Pan right.
2406988 2412577 - There.<br />- You seeing this all right?
2412661 2418208 Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged<br />one of Ripley's bad guys here.
2418291 2420251 Acid for blood.
2420335 2423922 If you like that,<br />you're gonna love this.
2437102 2438812 Quit screwing around.
2438895 2440647 Second squad, what's your status?
2440730 2443858 We just finished our sweep.<br />Nobody's home.
2443942 2446528 Roger.<br />Sir, this place is dead.
2446611 2449239 Whatever happened here,<br />I think we missed it.
2449322 2450991 All right. The area's secured.
2451074 2453326 Let's go in and see<br />what their computer can tell us.
2453410 2456246 - Wait a minute. It's not secure.<br />- The area's secured, Ripley.
2456329 2458123 First team, head for operations.
2459541 2461584 Hudson, see if you can<br />get their C.P.U. on line.
2461668 2462502 Affirmative.
2462585 2465088 Hicks, meet me at the south lock.<br />We're coming in.
2465171 2466047 Roger.
2466131 2469426 He's comin' in.<br />I feel safer already.
2469509 2471553 Pendejo jerk-off.
2483064 2487068 Sir, they sealed off<br />this wing at both ends,
2487152 2490405 welded the doors and blocked off<br />the stairs with heavy equipment.
2491740 2494534 But it looks like<br />the barricade didn't hold.
2494617 2496745 - Any bodies?<br />- No, sir.
2496828 2498747 Last stand.
2498830 2501291 Must have been a hell of a fight.
2501374 2504002 Yeah, looks that way.
2505920 2508047 All right, Drake, this way.
2508131 2511134 We should be able<br />to cut through the medlab to Operations.
2562936 2564854 Lieutenant.
2566689 2568691 Gorman.
2585583 2587252 Are those the same ones that...
2600515 2602559 Careful, Burke.
2612151 2616072 Looks like love at first sight to me.
2616155 2618491 Oh, he likes you, Burke.
2618575 2621202 Two are alive. The rest are dead.
2623079 2626040 Surgically removed<br />before embryo implantation.
2626124 2630837 Subject Marachek, John J.,<br />died during the procedure.
2630920 2633298 They killed him taking it off.
2633548 2637594 Yo, Hicks.
2637677 2640221 I think we got something here.
2644976 2646936 - Behind us.<br />- One of us?
2648229 2651733 Apone, where are your people?<br />Anybody in D block?
2651816 2654652 Ah, that's a negative.<br />We're all in Operations.
2657655 2659699 Talk to me, Frosty.
2659782 2661743 Let's keep moving, baby.
2680178 2682138 - It's moving.<br />- Which way?
2682221 2685767 It's coming straight for us.<br />Straight up.
2723304 2725264 - Fuck!<br />- Hold up.
2726849 2728351 Ripley.
2747870 2750999 Hey. It's all right.
2751082 2753334 - It's all right. Come on.<br />- Just grab her, Corporal.
2753418 2756504 Don't be afraid. Come on.<br />We won't hurt you.
2756587 2758881 It's all right. It's okay.
2758965 2761134 Come on out. Come on.
2761217 2763302 - Easy. Easy.<br />- I got her.
2763386 2765304 Damn!
2765388 2768182 - Watch her! She's under the grille!<br />- Don't let her go.
2768266 2771561 - Frost, get your light up here.<br />- Where'd she go?
2774480 2778317 - Shine the light.<br />- Here. Here.
2778401 2780111 - Here. Here.<br />- There she is.
2780194 2782822 Keep back. Keep back.<br />Don't scare her.
2782905 2784657 Grab her, man.<br />We're gonna lose her.
2784741 2785575 Damn it!
2787869 2789787 Kick it out!
2790830 2794000 Wait.
2819650 2822612 It's okay. It's all right.
2823613 2827408 Don't be afraid.
2827492 2829577 See?
2829660 2831579 Wait. No, you don't.
2831662 2835124 It's okay.<br />You're gonna be all right now.
2837376 2841547 Easy. Easy. It's gonna be okay.
2841631 2844133 It's all right.<br />You're gonna be okay.
2846344 2849430 Easy. Easy.
2885424 2887927 - What's her name again?<br />- Rebecca.
2888010 2891973 Now think, Rebecca.<br />Concentrate.
2892056 2894892 Just start at the beginning.
2894976 2898020 Where are your parents?
2898104 2900314 Now, look, Rebecca,<br />you have to try and help...
2900398 2903025 Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?
2905361 2908114 Total brain lock.
2908197 2910116 Physically, she's okay.
2910199 2911576 Borderline malnutrition,
2911659 2913411 but I don't think<br />there's any permanent damage.
2913494 2915913 Come on. We're wasting our time.
2925464 2927800 Try this.
2927884 2930219 It's a little hot chocolate.
2931721 2934140 There you go.
2936517 2938477 That good, huh?
2942857 2946319 I made a clean spot here.
2946402 2950198 Now I've done it.<br />Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.
2959749 2963294 Hard to believe<br />there's a little girl under all this.
2965296 2967465 And a pretty one too.
2971510 2974096 You don't talk much, do you?
2983105 2985066 Smoking or nonsmoking?
2985149 2987068 Just tell me what<br />you're scanning for, Private.
2987151 2989070 - P.D.T.s.<br />- What?
2989153 2991072 Personal data transmitters.
2991155 2993699 Every colonist had one<br />surgically implanted.
2993783 2996953 If they're within 20 klicks,<br />we'll read it out here.
2997036 2999205 So far, zippo.
2999288 3002208 I don't know how you<br />managed to stay alive,
3002291 3004669 but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
3006671 3008631 Newt.
3010633 3014136 - What'd you say?<br />- Newt.
3014220 3016430 My name's Newt.
3016514 3021644 Nobody calls me Rebecca<br />except my brother.
3021727 3025606 Newt? I like that.
3025690 3029485 I'm Ripley.<br />It's nice to meet you.
3031487 3034615 And who is this, hmm?
3034699 3038411 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3038494 3041455 What about your brother?<br />What's his name?
3041539 3043582 Timmy.
3043666 3048129 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3051173 3053134 Any sisters?
3056762 3058681 Mom and dad?
3061517 3065771 Newt, look at me.<br />Where are they?
3065855 3068899 They're dead, all right?<br />Can I go now?
3072028 3074488 I'm sorry, Newt.
3074572 3077158 Don't you think you'd be<br />safer here with us?
3081037 3083080 These people are here to protect you.
3083164 3085124 They're soldiers.
3085207 3088044 It won't make any difference.
3101515 3103559 Need anything else?
3106103 3109065 Hello, Bishop.<br />Do you need anything else?
3110941 3112985 No.
3115071 3117198 That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop.
3117281 3120201 Magnificent, isn't it?
3120284 3125331 Yo! Stop your grinnin'<br />and drop your linen! Found 'em.
3125414 3127958 - They alive?<br />- Unknown,
3128042 3129960 but it looks like all of them.
3130044 3134215 Over at the processing station,<br />Sublevel 3,
3134298 3136759 under the main cooling towers.
3137968 3140596 Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
3140679 3142598 Let's saddle up, Apone.
3142681 3144975 Aye, sir.
3145059 3147645 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.
3147728 3149688 Let's go. Head 'em out!
3149772 3151690 Okay, Frost, you're driving.
3163577 3167039 It's okay.<br />Don't worry. It'll be okay.
3207580 3209748 I want a straight V deployment,
3209832 3211584 second team on left flank.
3211667 3215713 Advance on axial 664.<br />Tracker on line.
3215796 3218924 Set the V gain to filter R.F. ambient.
3219008 3222511 Hudson, tracker on line.<br />Left and right, little buddy.
3224346 3228517 Forty meters in, bearing 221,<br />there should be a stairwell.
3228601 3230561 Check. Got it.
3232021 3233939 You want Sublevel 3.
3236150 3238402 Let's go, people.<br />Hudson, you got the point.
3238486 3240863 Hicks, watch our tails.
3240946 3244116 Nice and easy.<br />Check those corners.
3244200 3246452 Check those corners.
3249830 3251040 Watch your spacing.
3251123 3252458 All right.<br />You heard the man.
3252541 3254460 Don't bunch up. Stay loose.
3254543 3257296 Your transmission's<br />showing a lot of breakup.
3257379 3261592 Probably getting some<br />interference from the structure.
3261675 3263802 Use those lights.
3263886 3268265 Next one down, and proceed on a 216.
3268349 3270518 Roger. That's a 216.
3272728 3275731 I'm not making that out too well.<br />What is it, Hudson?
3275814 3278776 You tell me, man.<br />I only work here.
3293874 3295960 What is that?
3296043 3298254 I don't know.
3299964 3302258 Proceed inside.
3318065 3320943 Watch your fire and check your targets.
3321026 3323362 Remember we're looking<br />for civvies in here.
3333163 3335082 Easy.
3335165 3337626 Tighten it up, Frost.<br />We're getting a little thin.
3339420 3341714 Nice and easy.
3344008 3345926 Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
3346010 3349805 Yeah, but secreted from what?
3349888 3352558 Nobody touch nothing.
3352641 3355603 Busy little creatures, huh?
3355686 3357938 Hot as hell in here.
3358022 3359940 Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.
3360024 3361984 Knock it off, Hudson.
3369908 3373245 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
3373329 3375706 Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
3375789 3377750 Standard light armor-piercing round.
3377833 3380085 - Why?<br />- Well, look where your team is.
3380169 3383422 They're right under<br />the primary heat exchangers.
3383505 3385507 So?
3385591 3389303 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
3389386 3392598 Ho, ho, ho. Yeah.<br />She's absolutely right.
3392681 3393641 So? So what?
3393724 3397936 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
3398020 3400397 Right?
3400481 3405152 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and adios, muchachos.
3405235 3407863 Oh, great. Wonderful.
3407946 3410741 Shit!
3412701 3416538 Look. Apone.
3417873 3421293 Look.<br />We can't have any firing in there.
3421377 3425130 I... I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
3425214 3426215 Is he fuckin' crazy?
3426298 3429259 What the hell are we supposed<br />to use, man, harsh language?
3429343 3432179 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I...
3432262 3435224 Just do it, Sergeant.<br />And no grenades.
3436934 3438852 All right, sweethearts.<br />You heard the man.
3438936 3441021 Pull 'em out.<br />Come on. Let's have 'em.
3442022 3444733 Come on, Vasquez.<br />Clear and lock.
3447611 3449905 Damn!
3449988 3452116 You too. Give it up, Ski.<br />Come on. Let's go.
3452199 3455160 Crowe, I want it now.<br />Give it up.
3455244 3457204 Right on, Vas.
3458455 3460374 Let's go, marine.<br />Give it up.
3460457 3462584 Frost, you got the duty.<br />Open that bag.
3462668 3465546 - Thanks a lot, Sarge.<br />- Hicks, cover our ass.
3465629 3467548 Head 'em out, people.
3469633 3473220 I like to keep this handy...<br />for close encounters.
3473303 3475180 I heard that.
3484148 3486066 Any movement?
3486150 3488819 Nothing. Zip.
3501540 3503959 Holy shit.
3516764 3519266 Newt, go sit up front.
3519349 3521852 Go on! Now!
3550506 3553258 Steady, people.<br />Let's finish our sweep.
3553342 3556762 We're still marines,<br />and we got a job to do.
3556845 3560557 Keep it moving. Easy.
3592548 3594174 - Help!<br />- What?
3594258 3597010 Top, get over here. We got a live one!<br />You're gonna be all right.
3597094 3600264 Please... kill me.
3600347 3603225 Just stay calm.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
3603308 3605894 It's gonna be all right. Give me a hand.<br />We gotta get her outta here.
3605978 3608355 - What is it, Dietrich?<br />- Convulsion!
3608438 3611108 Dietrich, get back!
3611191 3613569 Get back!
3620701 3623996 - No!<br />- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!
3624079 3626707 Get back! Flamethrower! Move!
3656528 3658238 Movement!
3658322 3663076 - What's the position?<br />- I can't lock in!
3663160 3665537 Talk to me, Hudson!
3665621 3668790 Multiple signals.
3668874 3671001 They're closing.
3671084 3674379 Go to infrared, people.<br />Look sharp!
3674463 3677799 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
3677883 3679801 Pull your team out, Gorman.
3685641 3688393 I got signals.<br />I got readings in front and behind.
3688477 3690687 Where, man? I don't see shit.
3690771 3693273 He 's right.<br />There's nothing back here.
3693357 3695817 Look, I'm telling you. There's<br />something moving, and it ain't us!
3697861 3700864 - Oh, shit.<br />- Tracker's off scale, man.
3700948 3704242 They're all around us, man!<br />Jesus!
3704326 3707245 Maybe they don't show up<br />on infrared at all.
3717506 3719967 Frost!
3724096 3726056 Come on!
3732521 3735107 Jesus Christ, Apone!<br />What is going on?
3735190 3738151 Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!
3738235 3742239 - Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off! Frost!<br />- Dietrich, Frost, off the board!
3743657 3744908 Frost!
3746576 3750122 Wierzbowski?
3750205 3752958 Wierzbowski?
3753041 3756712 Let's rock!
3759423 3761049 Who's firing? Goddamn it!
3762050 3763301 Yeah!
3763385 3764803 I ordered to hold fire.
3764886 3767431 They're coming out of the walls!
3767514 3769891 They're coming out of the goddamn walls!<br />Let's book!
3769975 3772185 - On the right, man.<br />- Apone...
3772269 3775022 I want you to lay down a suppressing<br />fire with the incinerators...
3775105 3777858 Vasquez, Drake,<br />hold your fire, goddamn it!
3777941 3781862 Apone, are you copying me?<br />I want you to lay down suppressing fire...
3781945 3784489 with the incinerators<br />and fall back by squads to the A.P.C.
3784573 3786950 - Over.<br />- Say again, all after incinerator.
3787034 3790829 I said I want you to lay down<br />a suppressing fire with the incinerators
3790912 3791747 and fall back...
3791830 3794374 by squads to the A.P.C. Over.
3795292 3796334 Hey!
3798295 3800714 - Sarge! Sarge!<br />- Apone.
3800797 3803216 - Talk to me. Apone?<br />- Copy! Copy!
3803300 3805594 - Talk to me, Apone.<br />- He's gone!
3807262 3809681 - Get them out of there!<br />- Shut up!
3809765 3812684 - Do it now! Hicks, whoever's left, get...<br />- Shut up!
3812768 3814686 - Just shut up!<br />- Goddamn it!
3814770 3819191 - It's coming out of the goddamn walls!<br />- Where's Apone? Where's Apone?
3819274 3821568 The sarge is gone!<br />Let's get the fuck out of here!
3821651 3825447 Let's move it! Let's go, marine!
3825530 3828658 Hudson? Vasquez?
3828742 3831828 - Hudson, look out!<br />- Get it!
3832954 3834956 Watch it!
3835040 3837459 - Hicks.<br />- Come on. Behind you! Fall back!
3837542 3841046 - I told them to fall back.<br />- Fall back, goddamn it, now!
3841129 3843048 - They're cut off!<br />- Hudson, move your ass!
3843131 3845008 - Do something!<br />- Let's go, marine!
3845092 3847052 Fuck!
3847302 3850138 - Come on. Keep moving, baby.<br />- Hold on, Newt.
3855936 3859189 Ripley, what the hell are you doing?
3865112 3866822 Turn around!
3870200 3872577 That's an order!
3876081 3879543 - Get off me, damn it!<br />- Goddamn it, that's an order!
3879626 3882337 You had your chance, Gorman.
3893682 3895600 Come on!
3915162 3917789 Come on. Let's move it!
3917873 3920208 Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
3920292 3923753 It's blocked, man.<br />We gotta go around!
3923837 3928633 - Open the door! Hicks!<br />- Drake, we are leaving!
3928717 3930719 Get them, man!
3931595 3934181 Run for it!
3935265 3937726 Shit!
3940478 3943732 - Go! Go!<br />- Come on, man! Come on!
3951823 3955702 Drake, come on!
3958246 3960457 No!
3962542 3965378 - Fire in the hole!<br />- He's gone!
3965462 3967339 Put it out! Put it out! Go! Go!
3967422 3971176 - Come on. Put it out!<br />- Drake's coming, man!
3971259 3974221 - Drake! No, he's not!<br />- He's gone!
3975639 3977599 Forget him! He's gone!
3983438 3985357 They're in the goddamn door!
3988777 3991488 Eat this!
3991571 3994658 Ripley!
3994741 3997077 Go, go, go!
4059848 4061766 It's all right! We're clear!
4061850 4064269 Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
4064352 4066271 You're just grinding metal!
4066354 4068565 Come on, ease down.
4068648 4070692 Ease down.
4070775 4074529 Ease down. Ease down. Ease down.
4086207 4088460 You okay?
4089836 4091880 - I'm all right.<br />- Hudson.
4091963 4094049 Get away from me, man!
4094132 4098136 - Lieutenant.<br />- What happened to Gorman?
4098219 4101473 I don't know. Maybe a concussion.
4101556 4103850 - But he's alive.<br />- He's dead!
4103933 4106019 Wake up, pendejo, and then<br />I'm gonna kill you!
4106102 4109314 Back off. Right now.
4110774 4113943 - Fuck!<br />- Somebody get me a first aid kit.
4114027 4117155 Hey. Hey, look.
4117238 4120533 The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
4120617 4122619 Their signs are real low,<br />but they ain't dead.
4122702 4124996 - Then we go back in there and get them.<br />- Fuck that!
4125080 4127457 - We don't leave our people behind...<br />- I ain't going back in there.
4127540 4130001 You can't help them!
4130085 4134756 You can't. Right now they're being<br />cocooned just like the others.
4139052 4142347 Oh, dear Lord Jesus,<br />this ain't happenin', man.
4142430 4143306 Damn it.
4143390 4146434 This can't be happenin', man.<br />This isn't happenin'!
4146684 4150105 All right. We got<br />seven canisters of CN-20.
4150188 4153525 I say we roll them in there<br />and nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4153608 4154734 That's worth a try,
4154818 4156403 but we don't even know<br />if it's gonna affect them.
4156486 4159239 Let's just bug out<br />and call it even. Okay?
4159322 4160949 What are we talking about this for?
4161032 4164744 I say we take off<br />and nuke the entire site from orbit.
4167622 4169541 It's the only way to be sure.
4169624 4172877 - Fuckin' A!<br />- Hold on. Hold on one second.
4172961 4177132 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4177215 4179717 They can bill me.
4179801 4184848 Okay, look. This is an emotional moment<br />for all of us, okay?
4184931 4188351 I know that. But let's not<br />make snap judgments, please.
4188435 4191396 This is clearly... clearly an important<br />species we're dealing with,
4191479 4194232 and I don't think that<br />you or I or anybody has the right...
4194315 4197402 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4197485 4199028 Yeah. Watch us.
4199112 4201406 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4201489 4204159 but we just got our asses kicked, pal!
4204242 4207579 Look.<br />I'm not blind to what's going on,
4207662 4210248 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action.
4210331 4212417 I'm sorry.
4213543 4216463 Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...
4216546 4218506 has authority here.
4220008 4221926 Corporal Hicks is...
4222010 4224387 This operation<br />is under military jurisdiction,
4224471 4226389 and Hicks is next in chain of command.
4226473 4228641 Am I right, Corporal?
4228725 4230685 Yeah.
4231853 4234397 Yeah, that's right.
4234481 4236524 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4236608 4239068 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4239152 4241070 He can't make that kind of decision.
4241154 4243740 He's just a grunt. No offense.
4243823 4247577 - None taken. Ferro, do you copy?<br />- Standing by.
4247660 4250330 Prep for dust off.<br />We're gonna need immediate evac.
4250413 4252332 Roger. On our way.
4252415 4257045 I say we take off, nuke the site from<br />orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
4259672 4261382 Let's do it.
4268515 4272060 Let's go.<br />Pick it up, Hudson. Pick it up, baby.
4277273 4279442 All right. Set him down here.
4286032 4288076 Move it, Spunkmeyer.<br />We're rolling.
4293248 4295166 Hold on a second.<br />There's something...
4295250 4297544 Just get up here.
4297627 4300129 I'm in. Ramp closing.
4319857 4321818 Spunkmeyer.
4323027 4326698 Goddamn it.
4326781 4329117 Well, where the fuck...
4341879 4343798 Run!
4384672 4388468 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
4388551 4391012 Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
4391095 4393389 We're in some real pretty shit now, man!
4393473 4395850 Are you finished?
4398686 4400647 You all right?
4405860 4410073 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
4410156 4411783 I'm sorry, Newt.
4411866 4414744 You don't have to be sorry.<br />It wasn't your fault.
4414827 4415787 That's it, man.
4415870 4418247 Game over, man! Game over!
4418331 4420958 What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br />What are we gonna do?
4421042 4424170 Maybe we could build a fire.<br />Sing a couple of songs, huh?
4424253 4425463 Why don't we try that?
4425546 4428299 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
4428383 4431761 and they mostly come at night, mostly.
4448611 4452615 That's everything, right? All right.<br />This is absolutely everything...
4452699 4455702 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
4455785 4459330 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
4459414 4461582 That ain't so good.
4461666 4465336 We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.
4465420 4467380 Don't touch that.
4467463 4469924 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
4470007 4474053 Yeah. It's only half full,<br />but it's functional.
4474137 4478015 Got another one, it's damaged...<br />I don't know about that one.
4478683 4483062 How long after we're declared overdue<br />can we expect a rescue?
4485106 4487233 Seventeen days.
4488276 4490820 Seventeen days?
4490903 4492655 Hey, man,<br />I don't wanna rain on your parade,
4492739 4494741 but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
4494824 4497118 Those things are gonna<br />come in here like they did before.
4497201 4498494 They're gonna come in here...
4498578 4499412 Hudson! Hudson!
4499495 4501664 They're gonna come in here<br />and they're gonna get us!
4501748 4503833 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
4503916 4506961 with no weapons and no training.
4507044 4508963 Right?
4511299 4514010 Why don't you put her in charge?
4514093 4516971 You'd better just start<br />dealing with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
4517054 4519182 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
4519265 4521225 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
4521309 4524896 Now, I want you to get on a terminal and<br />call up some kind of floor plan file.
4524979 4527690 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
4527774 4530109 Anything that shows the layout of this<br />place. Are you listening?
4530193 4533279 - Yeah.<br />- I need to see air ducts.
4533362 4536741 I need to see electrical access tunnels,<br />subbasements,
4536824 4540536 every possible way into this complex.
4540620 4545166 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
4545249 4547502 - Okay, I'm on it.<br />- Hudson!
4547585 4552256 Just relax.
4555718 4560723 I'll be in medlab. I'll check on Gorman,<br />continue my analysis.
4560807 4563768 Fine. You do that.
4569941 4573778 So this service tunnel must be<br />how they're moving back and forth.
4573861 4576405 That's right.<br />It moves from the processing station...
4576489 4578825 right into the sublevel here.
4580868 4584205 Come down on that. Okay, come over.
4584288 4587500 Hold. Go back.<br />Okay, punch that in right there.
4593172 4595174 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
4596717 4599387 Well, there's<br />a pressure door at this end.
4599470 4603099 We could close that, weld it shut.<br />That should hold 'em for a while.
4603182 4605768 But we gotta figure on them<br />getting into the complex.
4605852 4608771 That's right,<br />so we repair the barricades
4608855 4610398 at these two intersections.
4610481 4613025 - Right.<br />- And weld plate steel over these ducts
4613109 4617029 here and here and here.
4617113 4620157 That should seal off<br />Medlab and Operations.
4620241 4623703 Outstanding. Now all we need<br />is a deck of cards.
4626038 4628124 All right, people.<br />Let's move like we got a purpose.
4628207 4631002 - Affirmative.<br />- Affirmative.
4633421 4636799 We're sealing the tunnel.<br />Baby, hurry up. Come on.
4649061 4650980 For what it's worth.
4652940 4655151 Here. I want you to put this on.
4656569 4658821 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
4658905 4662366 Then I can find you<br />anywhere in the complex on this.
4664243 4668331 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.
4668414 4671208 Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
4671292 4673210 All right, what's next?
4690561 4692605 Last stop.
4696609 4698527 Get in.
4698611 4702657 Scoot down. That's good.
4702740 4706786 Now, you lie here and have a nap.<br />You're very tired.
4706869 4710206 I don't want to. I have scary dreams.
4712667 4715753 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
4715836 4717755 Let's take a look.
4717838 4720132 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
4720216 4724553 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
4724637 4727139 Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...
4727223 4730226 because she's just a piece of plastic.
4730309 4733854 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
4740528 4742822 There.
4742905 4745783 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
4745866 4749161 no real ones, but there are.
4750496 4752415 Yes, there are, aren't there?
4754583 4756877 Why do they tell little kids that?
4758796 4760715 Most of the time it's true.
4764218 4765219 Here.
4766429 4768389 Take this.
4769974 4771809 For luck.
4775020 4776981 There's that.
4779150 4781068 Don't go, please.
4781152 4784697 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
4784780 4786699 And you see that camera right up there?
4786782 4789577 I can see you right through that camera,
4789660 4791996 all the time to see if you're safe.
4796375 4799044 I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.
4799128 4803048 I mean that. That's a promise.
4803132 4805801 You promise?
4805885 4808179 I cross my heart.
4808262 4812558 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
4827448 4831911 Now go to sleep, and don't dream.
4836081 4838042 Sneak.
4846842 4849637 The molecular acid oxidizes<br />after the creature's death,
4849720 4851096 completely neutralizing it.
4851180 4852723 Bishop, you know,<br />that's very interesting,
4852807 4854600 but it doesn't really get us anywhere.
4854683 4857228 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
4857311 4859396 Let's go through it again.
4859480 4861690 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there...
4861774 4866111 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
4866195 4870032 Which would mean that there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites, right?
4870115 4872243 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
4872326 4874245 Yes. That follows.
4874328 4878415 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
4880960 4882837 So who's laying these eggs?
4882920 4886048 I'm not sure.
4886131 4888217 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
4892763 4896100 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
4896183 4899478 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
4899562 4902940 that they were to be kept alive in<br />stasis for return to the company labs.
4905150 4907736 He was very specific about it.
4908529 4912575 Those two specimens are worth millions<br />to the bio-weapons division, right?
4912658 4916036 Now, if you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
4916120 4919331 and we will be set up for life.
4920374 4922960 You're crazy, Burke.<br />Do you know that?
4923043 4926046 Do you really think you can get<br />a dangerous organism like that
4926130 4927214 past I.C.C. quarantine?
4927298 4930175 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
4930259 4933304 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
4933387 4935890 Just like they'll know<br />that you were responsible
4935973 4937641 for the deaths of 157 colonists.
4937725 4940185 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
4940269 4942354 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
4942438 4946317 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
4946400 4949361 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
4949445 4951864 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
4951947 4954450 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />Do you ever think about that?
4954533 4958245 I didn't know. So now if I went and made<br />a major security situation out of it,
4958329 4959955 everybody steps in,<br />administration steps in,
4960039 4961707 and there's no exclusive rights<br />for anybody.
4961790 4965836 Nobody wins.<br />So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
4965920 4968672 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
4968756 4970424 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
4970507 4972134 These people are dead, Burke!
4972217 4974637 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
4974720 4977640 I'm gonna make sure that they nail you<br />right to the wall for this!
4977723 4979975 You're not gonna<br />sleaze your way out of this one.
4980059 4982227 Right to the wall.
4983896 4984897 Ripley.
4986065 4987066 I...
4987149 4989193 You know, I expected more from you.
4989276 4992196 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
4992279 4995699 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5002790 5005584 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5005668 5009213 That's it. Emergency venting.
5009296 5013967 Oh, that's beautiful, man.<br />Oh, man, that just beats it all.
5014051 5016929 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5017012 5020057 With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5020140 5023811 equal to about 40 megatons.
5023894 5024687 We got problems.
5024770 5027356 I don't believe this.<br />I don't fucking believe this.
5027439 5029942 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5030025 5032194 Why can't we shut it down from here?
5032277 5034196 I'm sorry.<br />The crash caused too much damage.
5034279 5036824 An overload is inevitable at this point.
5036907 5039827 Oh, man, and I was getting short.
5039910 5043288 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5043372 5045416 - It ain't half fair, man.<br />- Hudson, give us a break!
5045499 5048085 Four more weeks. Oh, man.
5048168 5051380 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the Sulaco.
5051463 5054425 I mean, there must be some way<br />of bringing it down on remote.
5054508 5058053 How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C.<br />It's wasted.
5058137 5060764 I don't care how,<br />but we'd better think of something.
5060848 5061974 We'd better think of a way.
5062057 5063392 Think of what?<br />We're fucked! We're doomed!
5063475 5064309 Shut up!
5064393 5067187 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5067271 5070065 The uplink tower down at the other end.<br />Why can't we use that?
5070149 5073110 No, I checked. The hardware in between<br />here and there was damaged.
5073193 5075112 We can't align the dish.
5075195 5077614 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5077698 5080617 take a portable terminal,<br />go out there and patch in manually.
5080701 5085789 Oh, yeah, sure. With those things<br />running around? You can count me out.
5085873 5086999 Guess we can just<br />count you out of everything.
5087082 5087916 I'll go.
5088000 5089793 That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?
5089877 5091712 - I'll go.<br />- What?
5091795 5092880 I'll go.
5093380 5096133 I mean, I'm the only one qualified<br />to remote pilot the ship anyway.
5096216 5100596 Yeah, right, man.<br />Bishop should go. Good idea.
5100679 5102848 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
5102931 5105851 I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
5117613 5119531 How long?
5119615 5122910 This conduit runs almost<br />to the uplink assembly, 180 meters.
5122993 5126288 - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...<br />- Right.
5126371 5130125 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
5131210 5133504 Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
5133587 5136799 - and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />- It's gonna be close.
5141303 5144014 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.
5145474 5149269 Watch your fingers.
5150270 5151647 Vaya con Dios, man.
5166370 5169289 I want you two walking perimeter.
5169373 5171542 Hey, listen.
5171625 5174586 We're all in strung-out shape,
5174670 5177965 but stay frosty and alert.
5179341 5182219 We can't afford to let<br />one of those bastards in here.
5182302 5185639 All right. Vámonos.
5195357 5197359 How long's it been<br />since you got any sleep?
5197442 5201071 Twenty-four hours?
5201154 5204449 Hicks, I'm not gonna end up<br />like those others.
5204533 5207369 You'll take care of it, won't you?
5208954 5213500 If it comes to that, I'll do us both.
5215210 5217963 Listen, let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that.
5218046 5221633 - All right?<br />- All right.
5221717 5226930 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
5227014 5230934 This is an M-41A pulse rifle,<br />10 millimeter,
5231018 5234855 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
5234938 5236899 Feel the weight.
5243822 5246116 Okay, what do I do?
5251538 5254207 - Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />- Right.
5254291 5256585 Lean into it.
5256668 5259338 All right. Now, it will kick some.
5259421 5263008 All right.<br />When the counter reads zero here, you...
5263091 5265344 - I press this up?<br />- That's right.
5267429 5270599 Get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
5270682 5273727 - Right.<br />- And you're ready to rock and roll.
5273810 5276605 - What's this?<br />- That's the grenade launcher.
5276688 5279441 I don't think you want<br />to mess with that.
5279524 5283528 You started this. Show me everything.
5283612 5285572 I can handle myself.
5287157 5289076 Yeah, I noticed.
5299252 5301213 How do you feel?
5301296 5304800 All right, I guess.<br />One hell of a hangover.
5306343 5308553 - Look, Ripley, I just want...<br />- Forget it.
5308637 5310597 Excuse me.
5365610 5370365 It's okay. It's okay.
5441103 5444523 Newt, wake up.
5444606 5446525 - Wha...<br />- Be quiet.
5446608 5448610 We're in trouble.
5466128 5467921 No!
5468004 5470674 Move, Newt!
5491153 5493071 Hey!
5502080 5506418 Help! Help!
5506501 5508461 - Hicks!<br />- Somebody!
5508545 5510463 Say again, Bishop.
5510547 5513925 You've got it into auto-refuel mode,<br />and it's sequencing right?
5514009 5517053 - That's right.<br />- Okay, good. Stay on it.
5518096 5520682 Get back to me when you've<br />activated the launch cycle.
5520765 5524060 - Roger.<br />- He's at the uplink tower.
5524144 5526646 - Good.<br />- Terrific.
5528356 5531359 - Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!<br />- Help!
5531443 5534029 - Help! Help!<br />- Hicks, help us!
5534112 5538200 - Break the glass! Break it. Break it.<br />- Yes.
5538283 5540285 I'll try.
5560555 5563016 Ripley, I'm scared.
5563099 5565101 Me too.
5570565 5572567 Stay here.
5584371 5587415 It's the medlab. Hudson!
5587499 5590835 Vasquez, meet me in medlab.<br />We got a fire.
5590919 5592921 We're on our way.
5595799 5597801 They're coming, Newt.
5630375 5632460 Shoot it out!
5636464 5638341 - Hudson!<br />- Jesus.
5641928 5644264 Christ, kid, look out!
5652188 5653189 Fucking die.
5665076 5668288 - Over there! Ready?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
5668371 5669998 Now!
5673501 5675420 - Hudson?<br />- Yeah. All clear.
5675503 5676421 Nailed the other one.
5676504 5678048 It's history, man.
5679466 5681384 Jesus.
5682552 5686139 Burke...<br />It was Burke.
5688391 5691603 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
5691686 5694606 Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
5697567 5701613 He figured that he could get an alien<br />back through quarantine...
5701696 5704407 if one of us was impregnated...
5705700 5707911 whatever you call it...
5707994 5710580 and then frozen for the trip home.
5710663 5714709 Nobody would know<br />about the embryos we were carrying...
5714793 5716836 me and Newt.
5718671 5720632 Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
5720715 5722967 Yes. The only way he could do it...
5723051 5726805 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
5726888 5729474 Namely yours.
5729557 5733436 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
5733520 5738900 Fuck! He's dead.<br />You're dog meat, pal.
5739901 5741820 This is so nuts.
5741903 5744531 I mean, listen.<br />Listen to what you're saying.
5744614 5747283 It's paranoid delusion.
5747367 5751704 It's really sad. It's pathetic.
5751788 5755583 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
5755667 5758962 You don't see them fucking each other<br />over for a goddamn percentage.
5759045 5762173 All right. We waste him.<br />No offense.
5762257 5763925 No! He's gotta go back...
5766094 5768721 - They cut the power.<br />- What do you mean, they cut the power?
5768805 5770390 How could they cut the power, man?<br />They're animals.
5770473 5773059 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!
5773143 5775061 - Gorman, watch Burke!<br />- I got him.
5775145 5777439 Newt, stay close.
5780942 5784028 - I'll go this side.<br />- You do that, man.
5807760 5810555 - Anything?<br />- There's something.
5810638 5813850 It's inside the complex.
5813933 5815935 You're just reading me.
5816895 5818813 No, no, it ain't you.
5820982 5824652 They're inside...<br />inside the perimeter. They're in here.
5824736 5828198 Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?
5834954 5836581 Hudson may be right.
5836664 5839792 - Get back, both of you!<br />- The signal's weird.
5841169 5843838 Must be some interference or something.
5843922 5845840 There's movement all over the place!
5845924 5849260 Get back to Operations.<br />It's game time.
5849344 5851721 Newt.
5853264 5856142 Seal the door. Hurry!
5856226 5859687 Come on! Come on! Come on! Get back!
5859771 5861689 Work fast.
5865068 5868238 Cover your eyes, Newt.<br />Don't look at the light.
5868321 5871324 Movement. Signal's clean.
5871407 5873326 Range, 20 meters.
5873409 5875578 They found a way in,<br />something we missed.
5875662 5877580 We didn't miss anything.
5877664 5881459 Eighteen. Seventeen meters.
5881543 5883920 Something under the floor,<br />not in the plans. I don't know.
5884003 5886089 - Fifteen meters.<br />- Ripley!
5886172 5889676 - Definitely inside the barricades.<br />- Let's go.
5891302 5893221 - Thirteen meters.<br />- That's right outside the door.
5893304 5895932 - Hicks, Vasquez, get back!<br />- This is a big fucking signal.
5896015 5899227 - How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me.<br />- Almost there.
5900853 5903231 That's it.
5903314 5907610 Twelve meters. Eleven.
5907694 5910196 - Ten.<br />- Then they're right on us.
5910280 5913533 - Nine meters.<br />- Remember, short, controlled bursts.
5913616 5914951 Eight meters.
5917954 5920623 Seven.
5920707 5923626 - Six.<br />- It can't be. That's inside the room.
5923710 5926754 - It's reading right, man. Look!<br />- Well, you're not reading it right.
5929340 5933928 Five meters, man. Four.<br />What the hell?
5936598 5940184 - Oh, my God. Oh, sh...<br />- Give me the light.

6043454 6045748 It's locked!
6063015 6066728 - Got it! Let's go! Let's go!<br />- Go! Go!
6069355 6072233 - Move, Gorman!<br />- Seal it!
6073276 6077572 Burke! Goddamn you! Open this door!
6086581 6090168 Get back!
6090251 6092545 - Hurry up.<br />- Gorman, get out of the way!
6092628 6095631 - Ripley, this way!<br />- What...
6095715 6097592 Wait. Get behind me.
6097675 6101763 Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!
6103097 6105933 - Hicks!<br />- Go! Come on. Let's go.
6107602 6109103 Move!
6116068 6118613 Which way is it to<br />the landing field from here?
6118696 6119572 This way.
6124160 6126996 Go right.
6129248 6131209 This way. This way.
6139842 6143304 - Which way?<br />- Straight ahead and left.
6143387 6146974 Bishop, do you read me?<br />Come in. Over.
6147058 6148935 The ship is on its way.
6149018 6152104 E.T.A. 16 minutes.
6152188 6154982 Stand by there.<br />We're on our way.
6166244 6168204 - Which way now?<br />- That way.
6168287 6171332 - No, wait. This way.<br />- You sure?
6172917 6175795 Vasquez, move!
6178381 6180550 - Right up here. It's just up here.<br />- Hicks!
6180633 6183511 We're almost there.
6183594 6186848 Newt, wait! Newt!
6210872 6212832 Vasquez!
6212915 6215209 Go!
6217378 6219881 Oh, no!
6231142 6233477 Newt.
6233561 6236898 Up there. There's a shortcut<br />across the roof.
6236981 6239066 Hicks.
6248492 6250620 You always were an asshole, Gorman.
6269013 6271223 - Newt! God!<br />- Ripley!

6273643 6276771 Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!
6281233 6283694 - Hold on, Newt!<br />- I'm slipping!
6283778 6285988 - Don't let go.<br />- Ripley!
6286072 6289116 - Hold on. Gotcha!<br />- Help!
6290117 6292578 I gotcha.
6292662 6295581 Newt!
6295665 6297500 No!
6300878 6303714 Come on.<br />We can find her with this.
6303798 6307510 - Stay where you are, Newt.<br />- Ripley!
6307593 6310680 We're coming.
6319897 6321899 Ripley!
6324360 6328072 This way.
6329657 6332994 - She's close.<br />- Newt!
6335663 6337581 Ripley!
6337665 6340126 Where are you? Can you hear me?
6341502 6343421 - Newt!<br />- Here!
6343504 6345715 - I'm here!<br />- Where?
6349760 6352805 Newt, are you okay?
6352888 6355683 We'll have to cut it.
6355766 6359186 Climb down, honey.<br />We've gotta cut through.
6366402 6368320 Newt?
6368404 6371699 Now, don't move. Stay very still.
6371782 6373784 Okay.
6373868 6376537 We're almost there.<br />Hang in there, okay?
6383711 6385504 - Hicks. Hurry.<br />- I know.
6385588 6388049 - I know!<br />- I mean it!
6401687 6404607 Newt? Newt, just stay still.
6407818 6410029 Almost there.
6410112 6411781 No!
6413240 6415326 Newt!
6425127 6428672 No! No!
6428756 6430883 - No! No! No!<br />- Let's go.
6430966 6433177 No! No! They don't kill you!
6433260 6435387 They don't kill you! They...
6435471 6437348 She's alive! She's alive!
6437431 6439850 All right.<br />I believe you. She's alive.
6439934 6442603 We've got to go. Now!
6457493 6459453 Go!
6473008 6477513 - Get it off!<br />- Hicks.

6527521 6529356 Plenty. Twenty-six minutes.
6529440 6532818 - We're not leaving.<br />- We're not?
6617152 6617987 Ripley...
6618070 6621573 I don't wanna hear about it, Bishop.<br />She's alive. There's still time.
6621657 6624785 In 19 minutes, this area is gonna be<br />a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
6624868 6627663 - Hicks, don't let him leave.<br />- We ain't going anywhere.

7530815 7532817 I knew you'd come.
7547749 7549917 He's gonna be all right.<br />He's just out.
7550001 7552378 I had to give him another shot<br />for the pain.
7553588 7556174 We need a stretcher<br />to carry him up to Medical.
7556257 7558259 Okay.
7563931 7567935 I'm sorry if I scared you. That platform<br />was just becoming too unstable.
7568019 7570813 I had to circle and hope that things<br />didn't get too rough to take you off.
7570897 7574859 Bishop, you did okay.

7961871 7964832 - Mommy.<br />- Oh, God!
7967752 7970921 Not bad for a human.
8018052 8021055 Are we gonna sleep all the way home?
8021138 8024141 - All the way home.<br />- Can I dream?
8026435 8029063 Yes, honey. I think we both can.
8037279 8040449 - Sleep tight.<br />- Affirmative.
