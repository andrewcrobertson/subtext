299841 304178 MAN: Bio readouts are all in the green.<br />Looks like she's alive.
306848 309642 Well, there goes<br />our salvage, guys.
336127 337712 How are we today?
337795 339339 Ohh. Terrible.
339380 341257 Well, better than<br />yesterday, at least.
342383 344677 -Where am I?<br />-You're safe.
345219 347680 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
347722 350391 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're okay.
351225 352852 Oh, looks like<br />you've got a visitor.
355730 357899 Jonesy. Come here.
359108 360735 Hey, come here.
361277 363404 How are you, you stupid cat?
363738 366491 How are you?<br />Where have you been?
367700 371621 Guess you two have met, huh?<br />I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
371704 376209 I work for the company, but don't let that<br />fool you. I'm really an okay guy.
377752 379420 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
380338 381631 They tell me that all the weakness
381714 383216 and disorientation should pass soon.
383257 385176 That's just natural side effects
385259 387303 of such an unusually long hypersleep,
387387 389097 or something like that.
389180 391265 What do you mean?
392016 393476 How long was I out there?
393601 395978 WOMAN (on PA):<br />Inhalation therapy, report to...
396062 398272 Has no one discussed<br />this with you yet?
398314 400400 No. But, I mean...
400441 404612 I don't... Recognize this place.
404654 406531 No, I know. Uh...
406614 410410 Okay. It's just that,<br />uh, this might be a shock to you.
410451 413121 -It's long...<br />-How long?
413454 414956 Please.
416165 419961 -Fifty-seven years.<br />-What?
420044 424215 That's the thing.<br />You were out there for 57 years.
424298 427593 What happened was you had drifted right<br />through the core systems.
428094 430471 And it's really<br />just blind luck...
430555 433975 That a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
434016 436060 It's one in a thousand, really.
436352 440440 I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.<br />You could be floating out there forever.
441107 443985 (stammering)<br />You... You okay?
444026 445361 (hisses)
445945 447238 Uhh...
447321 450700 (heart pounding)
450783 452118 (hisses)
452243 453578 (gasps)
453661 454871 BURKE: You okay?
455997 458374 (groaning)
460501 461544 (hisses)
461878 465173 Oh-h-h! Oh, God!
467341 470219 -Nurse! Please!<br />-God!
470595 472013 Someone get in here now!
472138 473514 (screaming)
473848 475349 Now!
475600 477727 -Hold!<br />-Please.
478186 480021 Hold on!
480688 482023 Kill me!
490448 491616 No!
491866 493284 No!
494577 496704 (gasping) Uh!
499457 502543 Bad dreams again?<br />You want something to help you sleep?
502960 504212 No.
505379 507048 (sighs)<br />I've slept enough.
508925 510551 Jonesy.
511302 512762 Come here.
513346 515681 -(meows)<br />-Shh.
519560 521103 It's all right.
522730 524941 -It's all right now.<br />-(purring)
526526 528027 It's over.
531405 533032 MAN 1: I'd just like to go, uh...
531405 533032 MAN 1: I'd just like to go, uh...
533783 536494 Back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.
536577 539956 -MAN 2: Is it in the file?<br />-I don't understand this.
540081 543376 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
543417 545920 Now, how many different ways<br />do you want me to tell the same story?
546963 549632 Look at it from<br />our perspective, please.
551008 552552 Please?
555388 557890 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
557932 560810 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class starfreighter,
560893 563271 a rather expensive piece<br />of hardware.
563312 566649 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
566732 568609 That's minus payload, of course.
569527 573990 The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates<br />some elements of your account,
574073 579161 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
579245 583749 an unsurveyed planet at that time,<br />that it resumed its course...
583791 588462 And was subsequently set for<br />self-destruct by you for reasons unknown.
588546 591132 Not for reasons unknown. I told you.
591215 597013 We set down there on company orders to<br />get this thing, which destroyed my crew...
597096 599181 And your expensive ship.
599640 603227 The analysis team, which went over<br />the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
603311 606147 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
606188 610109 Good! That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn air lock,
612320 613904 like I said.
616907 620661 Are there any species<br />like this hostile organism on LV-426?
620703 622997 No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.
625333 628836 Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply<br />while I was away?
628878 631339 Ma'am, I already said<br />that it was not indigenous.
631422 634008 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
634091 637178 It was not from there. Do you get it?
637219 638679 We homed in on its beacon.
639055 641766 And found something<br />never recorded once...
641849 645311 In over 300 surveyed worlds.
645353 648939 "A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host."
649023 650024 Yes.
650066 653778 These are your words.<br />"And has concentrated acid for blood."
653861 655029 That's right.
656572 659825 Look. I can see<br />where this is going,
660660 663037 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
663120 664747 Thank you, Officer Ripley.<br />That will be all.
664830 667750 Please. You're not listening to me.<br />Kane, the crew member...
668918 670211 Kane, who went into that ship,
670294 672588 said he saw thousands of eggs there.
672672 674715 -Thousands.<br />-Thank you. That will be all.
674757 676842 God damn it, that's not all!
677176 679679 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
679720 683391 Then all of this... This bullshit that you<br />think is so important...
683474 685393 You can just kiss<br />all of that good-bye!
702702 704370 That could have been better.
704912 707665 -Look, I think the... Ripley?<br />-Van Leuwen.
708582 711752 Why don't you<br />just check out LV-426?
711836 715631 Because I don't have to. There have been<br />people there for over 20 years,
715715 718217 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
718259 720553 What do you mean?<br />What people?
720594 723389 Terraformers. Planet engineers.
723806 727727 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
727768 729145 Takes decades.
729854 731939 It's what we call<br />a "Shake 'n Bake" colony.
732773 735609 How many are there?<br />How many colonists?
736277 738738 I don't know...<br />Sixty, maybe 70 families.
738946 740156 Do you mind?
743033 744869 Families.
747413 749248 Jesus.
771479 774023 (meowing)
779528 781822 (doorbell beeps)
783115 784658 (clears throat)
785826 788120 Hiya, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
788162 790456 of the Colonial Marine Corps...
791373 793709 Ripley, we have to talk.
793793 797087 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
804094 806305 I don't believe this.
806347 808182 You guys throw me at the wolves,
808265 810893 and now you want me<br />to go back out there?
810976 813062 Forget it. It's not my problem.
814021 816524 -Can I finish?<br />-No. There's no way.
818692 820778 Ripley, you wouldn't<br />be going in with the troops.
820861 823072 I can guarantee your safety.
823155 826450 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough hombres.
826534 828786 They're packing<br />state-of-the-art firepower.
828869 830955 There's nothing they can't handle.
831413 833707 -Lieutenant, am I right?<br />-That's true.
833791 836043 We've been trained<br />to deal with situations like this.
836126 838879 (scoffs) Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
839713 842341 BURKE: Yeah, but we don't know exactly<br />what's going on out there.
842383 844510 It may just be<br />a downed transmitter, okay?
844552 849014 But if it's not,<br />I would like you there as an adviser,
849139 850391 and that's all.
851725 852935 Look, I don't have time for this.
853018 854436 I've got to get going.<br />I've got to go to work.
854937 857731 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
858899 859984 That's right.
860067 861485 Running loaders and forklifts,<br />that sort of thing?
861569 862736 Yeah. So?
862778 865990 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
866073 868492 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
868576 870411 There's nothing wrong with it.
873664 876000 What would you say<br />if I told you I could get you reinstated
876083 877793 as a flight officer?
877877 881422 The company's already agreed<br />to pick up your contract.
881463 882590 If I go.
884842 886427 Yeah, if you go.
886510 888762 Come on.<br />That's a second chance, kiddo.
888804 891140 I think, personally, for you, it would<br />be the best thing in the world,
891223 894018 to get out there and face this thing,<br />get back on the horse.
894101 896729 Spare me, Burke.<br />I've had my psych evaluation this month.
897187 899023 Yeah, I know. I've read it.
899106 901066 You wake up every night.<br />Your sheets are soaking with sweat...
901108 903193 I said no, and I mean it!
906155 909074 Now, please leave. I am not going back.
909116 912286 And I am... I would not be<br />any good to you if I did.
913037 914955 Okay. Shh.
917082 919835 Would you do me a favor?<br />Just think about it.
923631 925132 Thanks for the coffee.
928677 932222 (door opens, closes)
934642 936685 (meows)
937937 941148 (screaming, panting)
945277 946570 Oh!
949239 951283 (sobbing)
964964 967091 (water running)
983857 986068 (beeping)
993951 995327 <i>Hello.</i>
995953 999289 <i>Ripley. You okay?</i>
999373 1001458 Just tell me<br />one thing, Burke.
1002459 1005546 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1005629 1010467 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1011719 1014221 <i>That's the plan.</i><br /><i>You have my word on it.</i>
1017725 1020060 -All right. I'm in.<br /><i>-I think that...</i>
1029236 1031196 And you, you little shithead,
1031238 1033615 (chuckles)<br />you're staying here.
1073447 1075532 (beeping)
1082831 1085084 (whirring)
1101517 1103560 Mmm.
1109108 1110651 (coughing)
1112986 1114488 (groans)
1118742 1122037 They ain't payin' us<br />enough for this, man.
1122746 1125457 Not enough to have to wake up<br />to your face, Drake.
1125541 1126834 What?
1127334 1130379 -Is that a joke?<br />-Oh, I wish it were.
1130462 1135384 Hey, Hicks. Man, you look<br />just like I feel. (grunts)
1135843 1137594 (coughing)
1137719 1139471 All right, sweethearts.<br />What are you waiting for?
1139513 1143142 Breakfast in bed?<br />Another glorious day in the Corps.
1143183 1146228 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm...
1146311 1151400 Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck<br />a fortune, every formation a parade.
1151483 1153068 -I love the Corps!<br />-Christ!
1153193 1155362 Man, this floor is freezing!
1155445 1157156 What do you want me to do?<br />Fetch your slippers for ya?
1157197 1159199 Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1159908 1162578 Look into my eye. Fall in, people.
1163036 1165038 Come on. Let's go.
1165122 1166540 I hate this job.
1166582 1168208 -Crowe, Wierzbowski.<br />-We got some slack coming, right?
1168292 1169543 Come on. On your feet.
1169585 1172838 You had three weeks on your back, Frost.<br />What do you want?
1172880 1175048 FROST: I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.
1175132 1177176 DIETRICH: Yeah, top. How 'bout it?
1180470 1184725 APONE: All right.<br />First assembly's in 15, people. Shag it.
1186018 1188687 Hey, Mira. Who's Snow White?
1189730 1192232 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1192274 1194651 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1194735 1199072 -Whoopee-fuckin'-do! Hey, I'm impressed.<br /><i>-Que bonita!</i>
1202034 1206330 Hey, Vasquez.<br />Have you ever been mistaken for a man?
1206413 1208457 No. Have you?
1208540 1213337 Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez.<br />You're just too bad.
1214046 1215172 Uhh!
1215797 1218258 (chattering)
1224223 1226433 Hey, top, what's the op?
1226850 1228977 It's a rescue mission.<br />You'll love it.
1229061 1230729 There's some juicy<br />colonists' daughters
1230771 1232648 we have to rescue<br />from their virginity.
1232731 1233732 (laughter)
1233815 1236360 SPUNKMEYER: Dumb-ass colonists.
1239780 1242324 -What's this crap supposed to be?<br />-Vasquez.
1242407 1245285 -Corn bread, I think.<br />-It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1245369 1249122 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting some<br />more of that Arcturian poontang.
1249248 1251124 Remember that time?
1251208 1253669 Yeah. Except the one<br />that you had was male.
1253752 1256129 Doesn't matter<br />when it's Arcturian, baby.
1256505 1257506 Hey, Bishop, man.
1257631 1259174 -Do the thing with the knife.<br />-Oh, please.
1259258 1261593 -Oh, come on. Yeah.<br />-(all goading)
1261635 1263553 All right! Yeah.
1263637 1265305 I don't want to see that, man.
1265430 1267182 Come on, man. All right. All right.
1268100 1270310 Hey, what are you doing, man?<br />Hey, what are you doing?
1270352 1272521 -Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />-Hudson, shut up!
1272646 1275148 -Bishop, hey, man.<br />-DRAKE: Do it, Bishop!
1275190 1276441 Hey! Not me, man!
1276483 1278819 -Hey, come on. Quit messing around!<br />-Yeah, you! Don't move.
1278860 1280153 Trust me.
1282698 1284408 (shouting)
1294167 1295919 APONE: All right. Knock it off, knock it off.
1296003 1298213 -Thank you.<br />-(Drake chuckles)
1300299 1302509 -There you go, short shit.<br />-Enjoy your meal.
1302968 1304678 That wasn't funny, man.
1308807 1311727 -Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?<br />-Yeah, thanks.
1312728 1314104 Looks like the new lieutenant's
1314187 1316148 too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1318775 1321528 Boy's definitely got a corncob up his ass.
1323322 1325866 BURKE: Thought you never miss, Bishop.
1328869 1331705 You never said anything about<br />an android being on board. Why not?
1332789 1335500 (chuckles) It never...<br />Never occurred to me.
1335876 1338879 It's just common practice.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1339171 1341548 I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.
1341923 1343383 Right.
1343550 1346303 -Is there a problem?<br />-BURKE: I'm sorry.
1346386 1348347 I don't know why I didn't even...
1348388 1350057 Ripley's last trip out, the syn...
1350098 1351850 The artificial person malfunctioned.
1351933 1353018 Malfunctioned?
1353060 1356396 There were problems<br />and a few deaths were involved.
1357022 1359900 I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
1360067 1362736 Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1362778 1365572 Well, that explains it then.<br />The A2s always were a bit twitchy.
1365655 1368408 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1368450 1369993 It is impossible for me to harm,
1370077 1372913 or by omission of action,<br />allow to be harmed, a human being.
1374081 1376625 -You sure you don't want some?<br />-(clattering)
1377501 1379836 You just stay away from me,<br />Bishop. You got that straight?
1383256 1385425 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1389846 1393100 (chattering)
1399439 1403276 -APONE: Squad, ten-hut! Officer on deck!<br />-As you were.
1403610 1406405 Quickly, quickly. Settle down.
1406446 1408448 All right. Listen up!
1409449 1412953 Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't<br />have time to brief you people
1413036 1414621 before we left Gateway, but...
1414704 1417124 -HUDSON: Sir?<br />-What is it, Hicks?
1417707 1420293 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
1422003 1423213 What's the question?
1423672 1427134 Is this gonna be a stand-up fight,<br />sir, or another bug hunt?
1428718 1431471 All we know is that<br />there's still no contact with the colony...
1431596 1434224 And that a Xenomorph may be involved.
1434433 1437436 -Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />-A Xenomorph.
1437477 1438895 It's a bug hunt.
1439563 1441273 What exactly are we dealing with here?
1441982 1443400 Ripley?
1444401 1446820 I'll tell you what I know.
1446903 1448989 We set down on LV-426.
1449656 1451867 One of our crew members was<br />brought back on board
1451950 1453368 with something attached to his face,
1453452 1456163 some kind of parasite.
1456246 1458331 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
1458665 1461418 Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.
1461793 1463670 Kane seemed fine.
1464045 1466423 We were all having dinner,<br />and, um...
1466506 1470469 It must have laid something<br />inside his throat, some sort of embryo.
1470510 1474514 -He started... Um, he...<br />-VASQUEZ: Look, man.
1474723 1477809 I only need to know one thing...
1478059 1479811 Where they are.
1479853 1482647 -Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />-Anytime, anywhere, man.
1482772 1484900 Right, right. Somebody said "alien."
1484983 1487611 She thought they said<br />"illegal alien" and signed up.
1487694 1489779 -Fuck you, man.<br />-Anytime, anywhere.
1489863 1491198 Are you finished?
1497454 1500165 I hope you're right. I really do.
1502375 1505086 Yeah, okay, right. Thank you, Ripley.
1505712 1508632 We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br />I suggest you study it.
1508715 1510175 Because just one of those things
1510217 1513428 managed to wipe out<br />my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
1513678 1516306 And if the colonists have found that ship,<br />then there's no telling
1516389 1518058 how many of them<br />have been exposed.
1518141 1519893 Do you understand?
1523146 1525524 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so you better look at it.
1526316 1527984 Any questions?
1529402 1530737 What is it, Private?
1531404 1533823 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
1533990 1535617 You secure that shit, Hudson.
1538453 1539788 All right.
1540705 1542040 Now listen up.
1544793 1546878 I want this thing to go smooth...
1547003 1548755 And by the numbers.
1549631 1554010 I want D.C.S.<br />and tactical database assimilation by 0830.
1554094 1555428 -(all scoffing)<br />-Ordinance loading,
1555470 1557389 weapons strip<br />and drop-ship prep details
1557430 1559641 -will have seven hours.<br />-Oh, come on.
1559724 1561351 Now, move it, people!
1561935 1564896 All right, sweethearts.<br />You heard the man, and you know the drill.
1564938 1568733 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
1584124 1586126 I don't care if you<br />are short, Hudson. Get it done.
1586209 1588628 Hey, Sarge.<br />You'll get lip cancer smoking those.
1588712 1591631 Corporal, I want this<br />loading lock sealed. Now!
1592632 1594634 -How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?<br />-Last one.
1594676 1596636 Good. Take it away.
1596678 1599055 (whirring, thudding)
1614112 1616031 Clear behind.
1622454 1624998 Did you check number three?<br />Let me see that.
1625123 1629044 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
1629294 1631421 I don't know.<br />Is there anything you can do?
1634549 1636217 Well, I can drive that loader.
1637677 1639679 I have a class 2 rating.
1641014 1642599 Be my guest.
1658573 1660533 (whirring)
1688395 1689646 Where you want it?
1689896 1691272 (chuckles)
1691856 1695402 (laughing) Bay 12, please.
1722095 1724597 (engines revving)
1751958 1753460 APONE: All right, sweethearts.<br />We're a team,
1753543 1755170 and there's nothing to worry about.
1755795 1759257 We come here, and we gonna conquer,<br />and we gonna kick some.
1759299 1760759 -Is that understood?<br />-Yes, sir.
1760800 1762218 That's what<br />we gonna do, sweethearts.
1762302 1764554 -We are going to go and get some.<br />-Hey.
1764637 1767307 All right, people! On the ready line!
1767390 1770226 -Are you lean? Are you mean?<br />-ALL: Yeah! Yeah!
1770310 1772896 -What are you? What are you?<br />-Lean and mean!
1773062 1775565 Hudson! Get on the ready line, Marine!
1775815 1778943 Get some today!<br />Get on the ready line!
1779027 1781863 -Yo!<br />-Move it out! Move it out, God damn it!
1782030 1785617 Get hot! One, two, three!<br />Get out, get out, get out!
1785658 1789245 Move it out, move it out, move it out! Move<br />it out, move it out, move it out!
1789329 1791998 (barking orders, indistinct)
1792040 1795668 (growls) Absolutely badasses.
1795752 1797962 Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!
1798838 1800340 All right! Move it!
1800423 1803051 -Let's go, let's go!<br />-One, two, three,
1803134 1805512 four, five, six!
1806554 1810016 All right. I want combat seating.<br />You know your places.
1810850 1813019 Get those weapons stowed. Let's go.
1813353 1815688 Come on. Settle down, people.
1818024 1819818 Lock 'em in, Hudson.
1819901 1822320 Ready to get it on? You know it!
1823029 1825031 Okay, Bishop, let's go.
1825698 1826866 Roger.
1829619 1831079 I'm ready, man.
1831871 1835375 -Ready to get it on! Go!<br />-(murmurs of agreement)
1839462 1841756 FERRO (on headsets):<br />Stand by. Cross-locking now.
1841840 1843466 Prelaunch autocycle engaged.
1847262 1850306 Primary couplers released.<br />Hit the internals.
1862527 1863528 Shit, man.
1863570 1865822 Confirm cross-lock<br />and drop stations secured.
1865905 1869242 GORMAN: Affirmative.<br />All drop stations secured.
1873079 1874414 Stand by. Ten seconds.
1878251 1882171 Stand by to initiate<br />release sequencer... On my mark.
1883172 1885633 -Five, four, three.<br />-We're on an express elevator to hell,
1885758 1887010 going down.
1887093 1890096 Two, one, mark.
1891264 1894225 Woo-hoo!
1906279 1908406 Switch to D.C.S. Ranging.
1908489 1910491 SPUNKMEYER:<br />240, nominal to profile.
1910575 1912785 We're in the pipe, five by five.
1923755 1926090 We're picking up some hull ionization.
1926132 1928468 Got it. Rough air ahead.
1928551 1930720 -We're in for some chop.<br />-(rumbling)
1944567 1946819 How many drops is this<br />for you, Lieutenant?
1949197 1950740 Thirty-eight.
1952116 1953534 Simulated.
1953868 1955662 How many combat drops?
1956079 1959832 Uh, two... Including this one.
1961000 1963211 -Shit.<br />-Oh, man!
1976432 1980228 Range 014. Turning on final.
1985566 1987944 FROST: And I'm telling you,<br />I got a bad feeling about this drop.
1988027 1989612 CROWE: You always<br />say that, Frost.
1989696 1991781 You always say,<br />"I got a bad feeling about this drop."
1991864 1994492 FROST: Okay, okay.<br />When we get back without you,
1994534 1997704 -I'll call your folks. (laughs)<br />-(beeping)
1999414 2003167 All right.<br />Let's see what we can see.
2003543 2007005 Everybody online. Looking good.
2008881 2012343 Drake, check your camera.<br />There seems to be a malfunction.
2013011 2015805 That's better.<br />Pan it around a bit.
2016222 2017807 Good.
2018558 2019809 All right, gear up.
2020143 2022979 Two minutes, people.<br />Get hot.
2023771 2025398 Somebody wake up Hicks.
2039203 2041122 Coming around for a 709er.
2041706 2043249 Terminal guidance locked in.
2043332 2044459 Where's the damn beacon?
2045585 2046794 Oh, I see it.
2053342 2056471 -That's the atmosphere processor?<br />-Yep, that's it.
2057096 2059807 Remarkable piece of machinery.<br />Completely automated.
2060099 2062351 You know,<br />we manufacture those, by the way.
2072820 2077283 GORMAN: Okay, Ferro. Take us in low<br />over the main colony complex.
2079285 2081370 Storm shutters are sealed.
2081454 2084999 There's no visible activity.<br />All right. Hold at 40.
2085208 2088002 -FERRO (on headset): <i>Roger.</i><br />-Give me a slow circle of the complex.
2096052 2097470 Structure seems intact.
2099305 2100723 They still have power.
2100807 2104310 Okay, Ferro. Set down on<br />the landing grid.
2104894 2107522 Immediate dust off<br />on my clear, then stay on station.
2121536 2123287 FERRO: <i>Down and clear.</i>
2125581 2127166 Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.
2130545 2133339 All right. I want a nice,<br />clean dispersal this time.
2135716 2137343 Let's go! Move it out!
2138261 2139804 Head 'em up!
2160950 2164579 First squad up on line. Hicks,<br />get yours in accord and watch the rear.
2165163 2167582 Vasquez, take point. Let's move!
2175923 2177175 Move up.
2181012 2182680 Hudson, run a bypass.
2188519 2190771 Second squad, move up.<br />Flanking positions.
2191189 2192690 APONE (over headsets):<br /><i>Second squad on line.</i>
2200114 2201240 (door lock clicks)
2221969 2223304 (whispers) You set?
2227016 2228267 Go on.
2254460 2256963 Second team, move inside.<br />Hicks, take the upper level.
2285658 2289954 APONE: <i>Sir, you copying this?</i><br /><i>Looks like hits from small-arms fire.</i>
2290454 2292707 <i>Uh, we got some</i><br /><i>explosives damage.</i>
2292790 2295501 <i>It's probably seismic</i><br /><i>survey charges.</i>
2295835 2299338 <i>Are you reading this?</i><br /><i>Keep it tight, people.</i>
2313060 2316897 GORMAN: <i>All right.</i><br /><i>Hicks, Hudson, use your motion trackers.</i>
2319275 2321610 (clicking)
2334749 2338461 Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
2344258 2345760 Quarter and search by twos.
2349388 2351599 (snaps fingers)
2357897 2359732 Okay. Dietrich, Frost, you're up.
2367073 2369075 (sniffs)
2372411 2374580 (clicking continues)
2379085 2381587 (clicking)
2398687 2400981 Wait. Wait, tell him to...
2402149 2405152 Hicks, back up. Pan right.
2407154 2408823 There.
2409949 2412034 <i>You seeing this all right?</i>
2412827 2417289 <i>Looks melted. Somebody must have</i><br /><i>bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.</i>
2418749 2420251 Acid for blood.
2420418 2423754 <i>If you like that,</i><br /><i>you're gonna love this.</i>
2431053 2433305 (hocking)
2437309 2438894 Quit screwing around.
2438978 2440896 Second squad,<br />what's your status?
2440980 2443899 HICKS: <i>Uh, we just finished</i><br /><i>our sweep. Nobody's home.</i>
2443983 2446527 Roger. Sir, uh, this place is dead.
2446610 2448571 <i>Whatever happened here,</i><br /><i>I think we missed it.</i>
2449155 2451824 (sighs) All right. The area's secured.
2452158 2453909 Let's go in and see<br />what their computer can tell us.
2453993 2456287 -Wait a minute. It's not secure.<br />-The area's secured, Ripley.
2456996 2459290 First team,<br />head for operations.
2459331 2461333 <i>Hudson, see if you</i><br /><i>can get their C.P.U. On line.</i>
2461417 2462501 Affirmative.
2462835 2464587 Hicks, meet me at<br />the south lock.
2464670 2466088 -We're coming in.<br /><i>-Roger.</i>
2466672 2469508 He's comin' in.<br />I feel safer already.
2469592 2471552 <i>Pendejo</i> jerk-off.
2483147 2486108 Sir, they sealed off<br />this wing at both ends,
2487193 2490279 welded the doors and blocked off the<br />stairs with heavy equipment.
2490362 2494700 -GORMAN: Mmm-hmm.<br />-But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.
2494783 2496702 -Any bodies?<br />-No, sir.
2497203 2498704 Last stand.
2498871 2501040 DRAKE: Must have been<br />a hell of a fight.
2501373 2503375 Yeah, looks that way.
2505878 2508255 GORMAN: All right, Drake, this way.
2508339 2511091 We should be able<br />to cut through the medlab to operations.
2563060 2565020 HICKS: Lieutenant.
2566855 2568148 Gorman.
2585958 2587209 Are those the same ones that...
2600180 2601473 Careful, Burke.
2603809 2605019 (gasps)
2612401 2614903 Looks like love at first sight to me.
2616488 2618782 Oh, he likes you, Burke. (chuckles)
2618907 2621076 Two are alive. The rest are dead.
2623203 2625998 "Surgically removed<br />before embryo implantation.
2626332 2630461 "Subject Marachek, John J.,<br />died during the procedure."
2630919 2632880 They killed him taking it off.
2633464 2637009 -(clicking, beeping)<br />-Yo, Hicks.
2638177 2640137 I think we got something here.
2645351 2646852 -Behind us.<br />-One of us?
2648437 2651732 Apone, where are your people?<br />Anybody in "D" block?
2651815 2654735 APONE (on radio): <i>Ah, that's a negative.</i><br /><i>We're all in operations.</i>
2657821 2659406 Talk to me, Frosty.
2660032 2661533 Let's keep moving, baby.
2673504 2674713 (crash)
2680344 2682096 -It's moving.<br />-Which way?
2682513 2685557 It's coming straight for us. Straight up.
2705327 2708622 (high-pitched beeping)
2723345 2725389 -Fuck!<br />-Hold up.
2727099 2728225 Ripley.
2748120 2751039 Hey. Shh. It's all right.
2751123 2753375 -It's all right. Come on.<br />-Just grab her, Corporal.
2753459 2756462 Don't be afraid. Come on.<br />We won't hurt you.
2756712 2758839 Shh. It's all right. It's okay.
2759298 2761175 Come on out. Come on.
2761258 2763385 -Easy. Easy.<br />-I got her.
2763469 2765179 Ow! Damn!
2765596 2768015 -Watch her! She's under the grille!<br />-Don't let her go.
2768557 2771143 -Frost, get your light up here.<br />-Where'd she go?
2774855 2776482 -Shine the light.<br />-Here. Here.
2778358 2780027 -Here. Here.<br />-There she is.
2781153 2782863 RIPLEY: Keep back.<br />Keep back. Don't scare her.
2783155 2784490 HICKS: Grab her, man. We're gonna lose her.
2784573 2785616 RIPLEY: Damn it!
2788285 2789745 HICKS: Kick it out!
2791163 2793749 Hey! Wait.
2818315 2819608 (clattering)
2819691 2822611 It's okay. It's all right.
2824071 2825489 Don't be afraid.
2827491 2828742 See?
2829868 2831537 -Wait. No, you don't.<br />-(screams)
2832162 2835499 It's okay. You're gonna<br />be all right now.
2835582 2837084 -(whimpering)<br />-Shh.
2838126 2841713 Easy. Easy.<br />It's gonna be okay.
2841797 2843924 It's all right.<br />You're gonna be okay.
2844007 2846260 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
2846343 2849388 Easy. Easy.
2875414 2878125 (whirring)
2886049 2888594 -What's her name again?<br />-Rebecca.
2888635 2891263 Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.
2892431 2894641 Just start at the beginning.
2895350 2897185 Where are your parents?
2898395 2900022 Now, look, Rebecca,<br />you have to try and help...
2900105 2902608 Gorman, give it a rest,<br />why don't you?
2905611 2907988 (sighs) Total brain lock.
2908530 2910616 Physically, she's okay.
2910657 2913785 Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think<br />there's any permanent damage.
2913869 2915829 Come on. We're wasting our time.
2925797 2927257 Try this.
2928133 2929968 It's a little hot chocolate.
2931678 2933472 There you go.
2934306 2935766 Whoop.
2936850 2938477 That good, huh?
2943440 2946735 Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.
2946818 2949988 Now I've done it.<br />Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.
2960332 2963168 Hard to believe<br />there's a little girl under all this.
2965253 2966505 And a pretty one, too.
2972636 2974137 You don't talk much, do you?
2983438 2985565 Smoking or nonsmoking?
2985649 2987609 Just tell me what<br />you're scanning for, Private.
2987693 2989277 -P.D.T.'s.<br />-What?
2989361 2991279 Personal data transmitters.
2991363 2993740 Every colonist had one<br />surgically implanted.
2993824 2997327 If they're within 20 klicks,<br />we'll read it out here.
2997369 2999204 So far, zippo.
2999538 3002666 Oh, I don't know how you<br />managed to stay alive,
3002749 3004626 but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
3006962 3008588 (whispers) N... Newt.
3011008 3014511 -What'd you say?<br />-Newt.
3014553 3016847 My name's Newt.
3016888 3020726 Nobody calls me Rebecca<br />except my brother.
3022019 3025022 Newt? I like that.
3025814 3029067 I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.
3031987 3034906 And who is this, hmm?
3034990 3038243 -Casey.<br />-Hello, Casey.
3039870 3041496 What about your brother?<br />What's his name?
3042247 3043957 Timmy.
3044041 3048587 Is Timmy around here, too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3051590 3052966 Any sisters?
3057345 3058638 Mom and dad?
3061641 3065771 Newt, look at me. Where are they?
3065854 3068857 They're dead, all right? Can I go now?
3072277 3073862 I'm sorry, Newt.
3075113 3077115 Don't you think you'd<br />be safer here with us?
3081244 3083080 These people are here<br />to protect you.
3083830 3085415 They're soldiers.
3085457 3087751 It won't make any difference.
3095801 3097219 (door opens)
3097844 3099805 (cart's wheels clacking)
3102140 3103809 Need anything else?
3106311 3108980 Hello, Bishop. Do you<br />need anything else?
3111441 3112818 No.
3115654 3117197 That's a nice pet<br />you got there, Bishop.
3117531 3119074 Magnificent, isn't it?
3120575 3125247 Yo! Stop your grinnin'<br />and drop your linen! Found 'em.
3125413 3127833 -They alive?<br />-Unknown,
3128667 3130001 but it looks like all of them.
3131002 3134256 Over at the processing<br />station, sublevel 3,
3135090 3136758 under the main cooling towers.
3138218 3140595 Looks like<br />a goddamn town meeting.
3141012 3142848 Let's saddle up, Apone.
3142931 3144516 Aye, sir.
3145350 3148270 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.
3148353 3149688 Let's go. Head 'em out!
3149771 3151565 Okay, Frost, you're driving.
3163827 3167122 It's okay. Don't worry.<br />It'll be okay.
3207913 3209915 GORMAN (on radio):<br /><i>I want a straight "V" deployment,</i>
3209998 3212083 <i>second team on left flank.</i>
3212167 3215962 <i>Advance on Axial 664.</i><br /><i>Tracker on line.</i>
3216046 3219090 <i>Set the "V" gain</i><br /><i>to filter RF. Ambient.</i>
3219132 3222969 APONE: <i>Hudson, tracker on line.</i><br /><i>Left and right, little buddy.</i>
3223053 3224221 (clicking)
3224262 3227849 GORMAN: <i>Forty meters in,</i><br /><i>bearing 221, there should be a stairwell.</i>
3228808 3230518 Check. Got it.
3232270 3234272 GORMAN: <i>You want sublevel 3.</i>
3236274 3238693 APONE: Let's go, people.<br />Hudson, you got the point.
3238777 3241112 Hicks, watch our tails.
3241154 3244115 Nice and easy.<br />Check those corners.
3245158 3246826 <i>Check those corners.</i>
3250121 3252457 -Watch your spacing.<br />-APONE: <i>All right. You heard the man.</i>
3252540 3254417 <i>Don't bunch up. Stay loose.</i>
3254793 3257921 GORMAN: Uh, your transmission's<br />showing a lot of breakup.
3258380 3261132 HUDSON: <i>Probably getting some</i><br /><i>interference from the structure.</i>
3261216 3262592 APONE: Use those lights.
3264219 3268265 GORMAN: Next one down,<br />and proceed on a 216.
3268640 3270350 APONE: <i>Uh, roger. That's a 216.</i>
3273103 3276273 GORMAN: I'm not making<br />that out too well. What is it, Hudson?
3276314 3278650 <i>You tell me, man.</i><br /><i>I only work here.</i>
3294332 3295625 What is that?
3297127 3298253 I don't know.
3299963 3301172 Proceed inside.
3318398 3321234 APONE (on headset):<br /><i>Watch your fire and check your targets.</i>
3321359 3323528 <i>Remember, we're looking</i><br /><i>for civvies in here.</i>
3333705 3335415 APONE: <i>Easy.</i>
3335540 3338543 HICKS: <i>Tighten it up, Frost.</i><br /><i>We're getting a little thin.</i>
3339502 3341588 APONE: <i>Nice and easy.</i>
3344299 3345967 Looks like some sort<br />of secreted resin.
3346051 3349804 Yeah, but secreted from what?
3350221 3352265 Nobody touch nothing.
3353350 3355268 Busy little creatures, huh?
3356436 3357896 Hot as hell in here.
3358355 3360231 Yeah, man,<br />but it's a dry heat.
3360315 3361816 APONE: Knock it off, Hudson.
3370367 3373495 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
3373578 3375747 Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
3376122 3377791 Standard light armor-piercing round.
3377874 3380085 -Why?<br />-Well, look where your team is.
3380168 3383129 They're right under<br />the primary heat exchangers.
3383296 3384464 So?
3385715 3389677 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
3389761 3393640 -Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.<br />-So? So what?
3394349 3397936 Look. This whole station<br />is basically a big fusion reactor.
3399104 3400313 Right?
3400814 3405193 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and <i>adios, muchachos.</i>
3405527 3407821 Oh, great. Wonderful.
3409114 3410657 Shit!
3413201 3417789 -Look. Uh... Apone.<br />-(snapping fingers)
3418123 3421584 Look. We can't have<br />any firing in there.
3421626 3425130 I, uh... I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
3425213 3426798 Is he fuckin' crazy?
3427048 3429300 What the hell are we supposed<br />to use, man, harsh language?
3429384 3430552 GORMAN: <i>Flame units only.</i>
3430635 3432345 <i>-I want rifles slung.</i><br />-Sir, I...
3432429 3435223 <i>Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.</i>
3436975 3439602 All right, sweethearts.<br />You heard the man. Pull 'em out.
3439644 3440979 Come on. Let's have 'em.
3442313 3444482 Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.
3448027 3449487 Damn!
3450196 3452407 You too. Give it up, Ski.<br />Come on. Let's go.
3452490 3455201 -Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.<br />-(chuckles)
3455326 3456995 Right on, Vas.
3458830 3460748 Let's go, Marine. Give it up.
3460832 3462584 Frost, you got the duty.<br />Open that bag.
3463251 3465545 -Thanks a lot, Sarge.<br />-Hicks, cover our ass.
3465628 3467088 Head 'em out, people.
3469841 3473511 I like to keep this handy...<br />For close encounters.
3473595 3475263 I heard that.
3475597 3477807 (tracker clicking)
3484481 3486191 GORMAN: <i>Any movement?</i>
3486316 3488860 Nothing. Zip.
3501998 3504000 Holy shit.
3517055 3519307 RIPLEY: Newt, go sit up front.
3520058 3521809 Go on! Now!
3550838 3553258 APONE: <i>Steady, people.</i><br /><i>Let's finish our sweep.</i>
3554133 3556803 <i>We're still Marines,</i><br /><i>and we got a job to do.</i>
3556886 3560515 <i>Keep it moving. Easy.</i>
3592672 3594132 -Help!<br />-What?
3594424 3595967 Top, get over here. We got a live one!
3596342 3597802 You're gonna be all right.<br />You're gonna be all right.
3597927 3600430 Please... K... Kill me.
3600471 3603266 DIETRICH: <i>Just stay calm.</i><br /><i>We're gonna get you outta here.</i>
3603349 3606102 <i>It's gonna be all right. Give me a</i><br /><i>hand. We gotta get her outta here.</i>
3606144 3608396 <i>-What is it, Dietrich? What's going on?</i><br />-Convulsion!
3608730 3611149 -(screaming)<br /><i>-Dietrich, get back!</i>
3611232 3613484 -Get back!<br />-(screams)
3620783 3621909 No!
3622285 3623995 APONE: Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!
3624078 3626789 Get back! Flamethrower! Move!
3627206 3629876 (alien screeches)
3632545 3633796 (groaning)
3633921 3635548 (screeching)
3636633 3637967 (hissing)
3656861 3658237 -(tracker beeping)<br />-Movement!
3658321 3659447 What's the position?
3661574 3663034 I can't lock in!
3663868 3665536 Talk to me, Hudson!
3666329 3667997 Multiple signals.
3668873 3670124 They're closing.
3671584 3674379 Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!
3674962 3678049 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
3678424 3679717 Pull your team out, Gorman.
3685848 3688393 I got signals. I got readings<br />in front and behind.
3688935 3690937 Where, man? I don't see shit.
3691062 3693231 He's right.<br />There's nothing back here.
3693314 3695817 Look, I'm telling you.<br />There's something moving, and it ain't us!
3697985 3700988 -Oh, shit.<br />-HUDSON: <i>Tracker's off scale, man.</i>
3701364 3704033 <i>They're all around us, man! Jesus!</i>
3704701 3706911 Maybe they don't show up<br />on infrared at all.
3711999 3713543 (screams)
3714752 3717547 (screaming)
3717630 3719257 -APONE: Frost!<br />-(screams)
3724512 3726222 Come on!
3730643 3731644 (screams)
3732770 3735606 -(steady beep)<br />-Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on?
3735648 3737608 HICKS: <i>Wierzbowski</i><br /><i>and Crowe are down!</i>
3737692 3740027 -Dietrich, Crowe!<br /><i>-Dietrich, Frost, off the board!</i>
3740111 3742280 Sound off! Frost!
3743614 3744907 <i>Frost!</i>
3746576 3749203 -(man screaming)<br />-Wierzbowski?
3750455 3753082 -Wierzbowski?<br />-(Wierzbowski screaming)
3753291 3756711 -(grunts) Let's rock!<br />-(Drake shouting)
3757295 3759380 (gunfire)
3759839 3761048 Who's firing? God damn it!
3762175 3763301 Yeah!
3763718 3765303 I ordered to hold fire.
3765803 3767472 HUDSON: <i>They're coming</i><br /><i>out of the walls!</i>
3767513 3769557 They're coming out<br />of the goddamn walls! Let's book!
3770224 3772351 -VASQUEZ: <i>On the right, man!</i><br />-Uh, Apone,
3772435 3775062 I want you to lay down<br />a suppressing fire with the incinerators...
3775146 3777732 Vasquez, Drake,<br />hold your fire, God damn it!
3777982 3780067 GORMAN: <i>Apone, are you copying me?</i>
3780151 3781903 <i>I want you to lay down</i><br /><i>suppressing fire...</i>
3781986 3784489 With the incinerators<br />and fall back by squads to the A.P.C.
3784572 3786949 -Over.<br />-Say again, all after "incinerator."
3787992 3791788 I said I want you to lay down a suppressing<br />fire with the incinerators and fall back...
3791829 3794373 <i>-By squads to the A.P.C. Over.</i><br />-(gunfire)
3795708 3796751 Hey!
3796834 3798920 (screaming)
3799003 3801047 -HUDSON: <i>Sarge! Sarge!</i><br />-Apone.
3801130 3803257 -Talk to me. Apone?<br /><i>-Copy! Copy!</i>
3803341 3805551 -Talk to me, Apone.<br />-He's gone!
3807678 3809388 -Get them out of there!<br />-Shut up!
3809472 3812850 -Do it now! Hicks, whoever's left, get...<br />-Shut up!

3817021 3818231 <i>Where's Apone?</i>
3818314 3819690 <i>Where's Apone?</i>
3819774 3822568 <i>The Sarge is gone!</i><br /><i>Let's get the fuck out of here!</i>

3825863 3828324 Hudson? Vasquez?
3828991 3831494 <i>-Hudson, look out!</i><br /><i>-Get it!</i>
3833204 3834956 -(alien screeching)<br /><i>-Watch it!</i>
3835039 3837750 -Hicks.<br /><i>-Come on. Behind you! Fall back!</i>
3837834 3840002 -I told them to fall back.<br />-HICKS: <i>Get out of there, God damn it, now!</i>
3840044 3841045 They didn't fall back.
3841128 3843381 -They're cut off!<br />-HICKS: <i>Hudson, move your ass!</i>
3843464 3845466 -Do something!<br />-HICKS: <i>Let's go, Marine!</i>
3845758 3846884 Fuck!
3847385 3849846 -HUDSON: <i>Come on. Keep moving, baby.</i><br />-Hold on, Newt.
3853474 3855643 (engines revving)
3856894 3858980 Ripley, what the hell<br />are you doing?
3859689 3861357 (tires squealing)
3865695 3866904 Turn around!
3870241 3871409 That's an order!
3876914 3879584 -Get off me, damn it!<br />-God damn it, that's an order!
3879750 3881627 You had your chance, Gorman.
3885798 3888259 (tires squealing)

4062183 4064727 Ripley, you've blown<br />the transaxle!
4064769 4066729 You're just grinding metal!
4066771 4069106 Come on, ease down.
4069148 4070733 Ease down.
4070775 4074028 Ease down. Ease down.
4082495 4083954 (Newt coughing)
4086749 4088709 You okay?
4089835 4092129 -I'm all right.<br />-Hudson.
4092171 4094715 Get away from me, man!
4094799 4098552 -Lieutenant.<br />-What happened to Gorman?
4098636 4102014 I don't know.<br />Maybe a concussion.
4102098 4103849 -But he's alive.<br />-He's dead!
4103974 4106143 Wake up, <i>pendejo,</i> and then<br />I'm gonna kill you!
4106227 4108938 Back off. Right now.
4109730 4110731 (thuds)
4111941 4114318 -Fuck!<br />-Somebody get me a first aid kit.
4114360 4116987 Hey. Hey, look.
4117655 4120866 The Sarge and Dietrich<br />aren't dead, man.
4120950 4122660 Their signs are real low,<br />but they ain't dead.
4122701 4124912 -Then we go back in there and get them.<br />-Fuck that!
4124995 4127206 -We don't leave our people behind...<br />-I ain't going back in there.
4127289 4128374 You can't help them!
4130543 4134755 You can't. Right now<br />they're being cocooned just like the others.
4139135 4141971 Oh, dear lord Jesus,<br />this ain't happenin', man.
4142012 4143722 Damn it.
4143806 4146475 This can't be happenin', man.<br />This isn't happenin'!
4146934 4150646 All right. We got<br />seven canisters of CN-20.
4150688 4153983 I say we roll them in there<br />and nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4154024 4156902 That's worth a try, but we don't even<br />know if it's gonna affect them.
4156986 4159572 Look, let's just bug out<br />and call it even. Okay?
4159697 4161198 What are we<br />talking about this for?
4161282 4164660 I say we take off<br />and nuke the entire site from orbit.
4168122 4169582 It's the only way to be sure.
4170166 4171167 Fuckin' "A"!
4171208 4172918 BURKE (stammers):<br />Hold on. Hold on one second.
4173002 4177006 This installation has<br />a substantial dollar value attached to it.
4177256 4178549 They can bill me.
4180134 4185055 Okay, look. This is an emotional<br />moment for all of us, okay?
4185139 4188684 I know that.<br />But let's not make snap judgments, please.
4188726 4191812 This is clearly... Clearly an important<br />species we're dealing with,
4191896 4194732 and I don't think that<br />you or I or anybody has the right
4194857 4196734 to arbitrarily exterminate them.
4196817 4197818 Wrong.
4197943 4199028 Yeah. Watch us.
4199486 4201822 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4201906 4204241 but we just got<br />our asses kicked, pal!
4205075 4207953 Look. I'm not blind<br />to what's going on,
4208037 4211415 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action. I'm sorry.
4213918 4216170 Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...
4217171 4218547 Has authority here.
4220633 4222009 Corporal Hicks is...
4222092 4224553 This operation is under<br />military jurisdiction,
4224595 4226555 and Hicks is next<br />in chain of command.
4226597 4227806 Am I right, Corporal?
4229058 4230476 Yeah.
4232144 4233938 Yeah, that's right.
4234688 4237024 -Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />-Yes.
4237107 4239443 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4239485 4241445 He can't make<br />that kind of decision.
4241528 4243781 He's just a grunt. Uh, no offense.
4243822 4247952 -None taken. Ferro, do you copy?<br />-FERRO: <i>Standing by.</i>
4248035 4250371 Prep for dust off.<br />We're gonna need immediate evac.
4250454 4252373 FERRO: <i>Roger. On our way.</i>
4252456 4255459 I say we take off,<br />nuke the site from orbit.
4255834 4257086 It's the only way to be sure.
4259964 4261257 Let's do it.
4261757 4263676 (wind whistling)
4268973 4272309 Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson.<br />Pick it up, baby.
4277648 4279608 All right. Set him down here.
4286198 4288117 Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.
4293956 4295582 Hold on a second. There's something...
4295666 4297835 FERRO: Just get up here.
4297876 4300087 I'm in. Ramp closing.
4320607 4321942 Spunkmeyer.
4323193 4326905 -God damn it.<br />-(door opens)
4327281 4328866 Well, where the fuck...
4329742 4331285 (hisses)
4341879 4342963 Run!
4371742 4373035 (grunts)
4385172 4388759 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
4388801 4391220 Now what the fuck<br />are we supposed to do?
4391261 4393639 We're in some<br />real pretty shit now, man!
4393722 4395349 Are you finished?
4398894 4400229 You all right?
4405901 4408862 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
4410280 4411865 I'm sorry, Newt.
4411949 4414868 You don't have to be sorry.<br />It wasn't your fault.
4414952 4418455 That's it, man.<br />Game over, man! Game over!
4418497 4421208 What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br />What are we gonna do?
4421291 4425629 Maybe we could build a fire. Sing a couple of<br />songs, huh? Why don't we try that?
4425671 4428549 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
4428632 4431385 and they mostly<br />come at night, mostly.
4448944 4450446 That's everything, right?
4450988 4452865 All right. This is<br />absolutely everything...
4452948 4455951 That we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. Wreckage.
4455993 4459371 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
4459538 4460873 That ain't so good.
4461748 4465377 We got, uh,<br />15 of these M-40 grenades.
4465586 4466920 Don't touch that.
4467629 4469923 -Dangerous, honey.<br />-Is that the only flamethrower?
4470674 4473343 HICKS: Yeah.<br />It's only half full, but it's functional.
4474136 4477347 Got another one, it's damaged...<br />I don't know about that one.
4478807 4481935 How long after we're declared<br />overdue can we expect a rescue?
4485939 4487274 Seventeen days.
4488484 4489818 Seventeen days?
4491028 4494781 Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your<br />parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
4495324 4497451 Those things are gonna<br />come in here just like they did before.
4497534 4498535 And they're gonna<br />come in here...
4498577 4499620 -Hudson! Hudson!<br />-They're gonna come in here
4499703 4501705 and they're gonna get us!
4502039 4504208 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
4504291 4506835 With no weapons<br />and no training.
4506877 4507920 Right?
4511673 4513467 Why don't you<br />put her in charge?
4513550 4517054 You'd better just start<br />dealing with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
4517137 4519223 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
4519264 4520849 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
4521558 4523644 Now, I want you to get on<br />a terminal and call up
4523727 4525896 some kind of floor plan file.<br />Do you understand?
4526396 4527981 Construction blueprints.<br />I don't care.
4528065 4530192 Anything that shows<br />the layout of this place. Are you listening?
4530526 4533153 -Yeah.<br />-I need to see air ducts.
4533487 4536782 I need to see electrical<br />access tunnels, subbasements,
4536865 4539409 every possible way into this complex.
4541078 4542412 We don't have much time.
4542996 4544248 Okay.
4545582 4547543 -Okay, I'm on it.<br />-RIPLEY: Hudson!
4547918 4549336 Just relax.
4550879 4552214 (exhales sharply)
4555884 4560389 I'll be in medlab.<br />I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.
4560806 4563684 Fine. You do that.
4570607 4573819 RIPLEY: So this service tunnel must be how<br />they're moving back and forth.
4573902 4576488 HUDSON: That's right. It moves<br />from the processing station
4576572 4578490 right into the sublevel here.
4581118 4583453 Come down on that. Okay, come over.
4584413 4587791 Hold. Go back.<br />Okay, punch that in right there.
4593297 4594965 -No. It's back here.<br />-Okay.
4597050 4599428 Well, there's a pressure door<br />at this end.
4599636 4601805 We could close that, weld it shut.
4601847 4603140 That should hold 'em for a while.
4603515 4605767 HUDSON: But we gotta<br />figure on them getting into the complex.
4605809 4610439 That's right, so we repair the<br />barricades at these two intersections.
4610522 4613150 -Right.<br />-And weld plate steel over these ducts...
4613191 4616778 Here and here and here.
4617529 4621450 -That should seal off medlab and operations.<br />-Outstanding.
4622117 4623660 Now all we need<br />is a deck of cards.
4626330 4627998 All right, people.<br />Let's move like we got a purpose.
4628290 4630834 -HUDSON: Affirmative.<br />-Affirmative.
4633462 4636715 We're sealing the tunnel.<br />Baby, hurry up. Come on!
4639051 4640719 (welder crackling)
4649186 4650687 For what it's worth.
4653065 4655192 Here. I want you to put this on.
4656735 4658945 -What's it for?<br />-It's a locator.
4659029 4660864 Then I can find you<br />anywhere in the complex on this.
4661323 4662407 (beeping)
4664242 4665702 It's just a precaution.
4666787 4668121 Thanks.
4668497 4670707 Doesn't mean we're<br />engaged or anything.
4671833 4673210 All right, what's next?
4680384 4682719 (beeping)
4685472 4687808 (door closes)
4690394 4691853 Last stop.
4696650 4698527 Get in.
4698568 4702572 Scoot down. That's good.
4702739 4706368 Now, you lie here and have a nap.<br />You're very tired.
4706868 4710163 I don't want to. I have scary dreams.
4712708 4715669 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
4715752 4717796 Let's take a look.
4717879 4720090 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
4720257 4724636 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
4724720 4727305 Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams
4727389 4730142 because she's just a piece of plastic.
4730600 4733270 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
4740777 4742821 There.
4742904 4745949 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
4746032 4748452 No real ones...<br />But there are.
4750537 4752330 Yes, there are, aren't there?
4754666 4756710 Why do they tell little kids that?
4759171 4760714 Most of the time it's true.
4764176 4765552 Here.
4767304 4768764 Take this.
4769848 4771308 For luck.
4774978 4776480 There's that.
4779483 4781193 Don't go, please.
4781276 4783320 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
4784821 4786740 And you see that camera<br />right up there?
4787616 4789618 I can see you<br />right through that camera,
4789659 4791828 all the time to see if you're safe.
4796666 4798627 I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.
4799211 4800754 I mean that.
4801588 4802881 That's a promise.
4803256 4804674 You promise?
4806343 4808136 I cross my heart.
4808512 4810013 And hope to die?
4811348 4812599 And hope to die.
4821608 4823568 (kisses)
4827572 4828865 Now go to sleep,
4829783 4831660 and don't dream.
4832911 4834371 (laughs)
4836122 4837541 Sneak.
4843088 4845090 (door opens)
4847175 4851221 The molecular acid oxidizes after the<br />creature's death, completely neutralizing it.
4851263 4852681 Bishop, you know,<br />that's very interesting,
4852722 4854599 but it doesn't really<br />get us anywhere, does it?
4854683 4857352 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
4857394 4859563 Let's go through it again.
4859604 4861773 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there
4861857 4865068 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
4866111 4867612 Which would mean that<br />there would have to be
4867696 4870073 a lot of these parasites, right?
4870115 4872284 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
4872409 4873994 Yes. That follows.
4874494 4877747 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
4881209 4882878 So who's laying these eggs?
4884129 4885630 I'm not sure.
4886423 4888133 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
4892762 4896057 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
4896099 4897100 Is that clear?
4898268 4899561 Mr. Burke gave instructions
4899603 4901146 that they were to be kept alive in stasis
4901229 4902856 for return to the company labs.
4906067 4907777 He was very specific about it.
4908862 4912699 Look. Those two specimens are worth<br />millions to the bio-weapons division, right?
4912782 4916411 Now, if you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
4916453 4918872 and we will be set up for life.
4920457 4922500 You're crazy, Burke.<br />Do you know that?
4923251 4925295 Do you really think you can get<br />a dangerous organism like that
4925378 4927422 past I.C.C. quarantine?
4927464 4930216 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
4930300 4933386 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
4933470 4935347 Just like they'll know<br />that you were responsible
4935430 4937974 for the deaths of 157 colonists.
4938016 4940393 -Wait a second.<br />-You sent them to that ship.
4940477 4942479 -You're wrong.<br />-I just checked the colony log.
4942520 4946524 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
4946608 4949569 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
4949653 4951988 -Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />-Okay, look.
4952030 4954616 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />Do you ever think about that?
4954658 4958370 I didn't know. So now if I went and<br />made a major security situation out of it,
4958453 4960372 everybody steps in,<br />administration steps in,
4960455 4962082 and there's<br />no exclusive rights for anybody.
4962165 4966169 Nobody wins.<br />So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
4966252 4969130 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
4969172 4970423 -Bad call?<br />-Right.
4970507 4972175 These people are dead, Burke!
4972217 4974761 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
4974844 4977764 Well, I'm gonna make sure<br />that they nail you right to the wall for this!
4977847 4980058 You're not gonna<br />sleaze your way out of this one.
4980141 4981768 Right to the wall.
4984270 4987065 Ripley. I...
4987357 4989401 You know, I expected more from you.
4989484 4992070 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
4993321 4995198 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5003039 5005917 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5006001 5009379 That's it. Emergency venting.
5009504 5014259 Oh, that's beautiful, man.<br />Oh, man, that... That just beats it all.
5014384 5017220 -How long till it blows?<br />-Four hours.
5017262 5020390 -(groans)<br />-With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5020473 5022726 equal to about 40 megatons.
5024102 5025103 We got problems.
5025186 5027689 HUDSON: I don't believe this.<br />I don't fucking believe this.
5027731 5030150 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5030233 5032485 Why can't we shut it<br />down from here?
5032569 5034529 I'm sorry. The crash caused<br />too much damage.
5034571 5037073 An overload is inevitable at this point.
5037115 5040243 Oh, man, and I was getting short.
5040326 5043580 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5043705 5045415 -It ain't half fair, man.<br />-Hudson, give us a break!
5045582 5048334 HUDSON: Four more weeks.<br />Oh, man.
5048418 5051629 Oh, we've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the Sulaco.
5051755 5054424 I mean, there must be some way<br />of bringing it down on remote.
5054632 5058053 How? The transmitter<br />was on the A.P.C. It's wasted.
5058261 5060764 Well, I don't care how,<br />but we'd better think of something.
5060847 5061931 We'd better think<br />of a way.
5062098 5063099 -Think of what? We're fucked!<br />-HICKS: Shut up!
5063183 5064267 We're doomed!
5064350 5067228 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5067270 5070106 The uplink tower down at the other end.<br />Why can't we use that?
5070190 5073443 No, I checked. The hardware in between<br />here and there was damaged.
5073568 5074986 We can't align the dish.
5075695 5077864 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5077947 5080575 take a portable terminal,<br />go out there and patch in manually.
5081117 5085789 Oh, yeah, sure. With those things running<br />around? You can count me out.
5085955 5086956 -Yeah. I guess we can just...<br />-I'll go.
5086998 5088041 ...count you out of everything.
5088124 5089959 HUDSON: That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?
5090001 5091753 -BISHOP: I'll go.<br />-What?
5091795 5093588 I'll go.
5093630 5096049 I mean, I'm the only one<br />qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway.
5096716 5100345 Yeah, right, man.<br />Bishop should go. Good idea.
5101137 5105600 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.<br />I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
5118446 5119572 RIPLEY: How long?
5119656 5123118 This conduit runs almost<br />to the uplink assembly... 180 meters.
5123243 5126329 -Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...<br />-RIPLEY: Right.
5127288 5130375 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
5131417 5133711 Thirty minutes<br />to prep the ship,
5133795 5136840 -and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />-It's gonna be close.
5141678 5144013 -Good luck.<br />-See you soon.
5145682 5148518 Watch your fingers. (grunts)
5151729 5152856 <i>Vaya con dios,</i> man.
5166411 5168496 I want you two walking perimeter.
5169539 5170915 Hey, listen.
5171875 5173960 We're all in strung-out shape,
5174919 5177672 but stay frosty and alert.
5179757 5182218 We can't afford to let<br />one of those bastards in here.
5182677 5185597 All right. <i>Vamonos.</i>
5195607 5197400 How long's it been<br />since you got any sleep?
5198359 5199777 Twenty-four hours?
5201529 5204073 Hicks, I'm not gonna end up<br />like those others.
5204824 5206826 You'll take care of it, won't you?
5209370 5213374 If it comes to that,<br />I'll do us both.
5215501 5217754 Listen, let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that.
5218213 5221424 -All right?<br />-All right.
5222592 5226429 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
5227305 5231059 This is an M-41A<br />pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,
5231392 5234896 with an over-and-under 30<br />millimeter pump-action grenade launcher.
5235355 5236940 Feel the weight.
5244113 5246115 Okay, what do I do?
5251996 5254582 -Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />-Right.
5254624 5257043 -Uh-huh. Lean into it.<br />-Mmm-hmm.
5257126 5259295 All right. Now, it will kick some.
5259754 5263466 All right. When the counter<br />reads zero here, you...
5263508 5265885 -I press this up?<br />-That's right.
5267845 5270598 Get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
5271474 5273810 -Right.<br />-And you're ready to rock and roll.
5274269 5277188 -What's this?<br />-That's the grenade launcher.
5277272 5279357 I don't think you<br />want to mess with that.
5279816 5282610 You started this.<br />Show me everything.
5283903 5285488 I can handle myself.
5287740 5289158 Yeah, I noticed.
5299794 5301587 How do you feel?
5301671 5305008 All right, I guess.<br />One hell of a hangover.
5306676 5308886 -Look, Ripley, I just want...<br />-Forget it.
5309012 5310346 Excuse me.
5363232 5365943 (Newt groaning)
5366069 5370406 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.<br />It's okay. It's okay.
5441185 5444605 (whispering) Newt, wake up.
5444647 5446482 -Wha...<br />-Be quiet.
5446524 5448443 We're in trouble.
5466544 5467920 -No!<br />-(screams)
5469005 5470506 Move, Newt!
5485813 5487982 (both grunting)
5491944 5493070 Hey!
5493529 5495281 (no audio)
5502830 5506584 Help! Help!
5507001 5508377 -Hicks!<br />-Somebody!
5508836 5510713 HICKS: Say again, Bishop.
5510796 5513925 You've got it into auto-refuel<br />mode, and it's sequencing right?
5514008 5517053 -BISHOP (on radio): <i>That's right.</i><br />-Okay, good. Stay on it.
5517136 5518763 (indistinct)
5518888 5520515 Get back to me when you've<br />activated the launch cycle.
5520556 5521766 <i>Roger.</i>
5522934 5524393 He's at the uplink tower.
5524477 5526479 -Good.<br />-Terrific.
5528940 5531526 -RIPLEY: Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!<br />-NEWT: Help!
5531567 5534028 -Help! Help!<br />-Hicks, help us!
5534278 5537823 -Break the glass! Break it. Break it.<br />-Yes.
5538741 5540451 I'll try.
5554465 5555716 (scurrying)
5557426 5559178 (clinking)
5560513 5562848 Ripley, I'm scared.
5564016 5565476 Me, too.
5570815 5572108 Stay here.
5581659 5584120 (alarm blaring)
5585454 5587290 It's the medlab. Hudson!
5587957 5590626 Vasquez, meet me in medlab.<br />We got a fire.
5590710 5592753 HUDSON (on radio):<br /><i>We're on our way.</i>
5596173 5597842 They're coming, Newt.
5603556 5605308 (screaming)
5605683 5607310 -(grunts)<br />-(screaming continues)
5607810 5609145 (grunts)
5613190 5614900 (screaming)
5618571 5619905 (gasping)
5621699 5623492 (screaming continues)
5630708 5632460 Shoot it out!
5636839 5638341 -Hudson!<br />-Jesus.
5640676 5641886 (gasping)
5642219 5643804 Christ, kid, look out!
5652104 5653189 Fucking die.
5665201 5668287 -Over there! Ready?<br />-Yeah! Yeah!
5668371 5669538 HICKS: Now!
5673501 5675711 -Hudson?<br />-Yeah. All clear.
5675753 5678047 -Nailed the other one. It's history, man.<br />-(coughing)
5679215 5680383 Jesus.
5682468 5685680 Burke... (coughs)<br />It was Burke.
5688391 5691394 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
5691602 5694355 Just doesn't make<br />any goddamn sense.
5697566 5701570 He figured that he could get an<br />alien back through quarantine...
5701654 5704448 If one of us was impregnated...
5705491 5707243 Whatever you call it...
5707952 5710162 And then frozen for the trip home.
5711372 5714583 Nobody would know<br />about the embryos we were carrying...
5715584 5716836 Me and Newt.
5719088 5720673 Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
5721006 5723217 Yes. The only way he could do it...
5723259 5726721 Is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
5726762 5727888 Namely yours.
5729598 5731225 Then he could jettison the bodies
5731267 5733519 and make up any story he liked.
5733602 5738107 Fuck! He's dead. You're dog meat, pal.
5739984 5741777 This is so nuts.
5741902 5744947 I mean, listen...<br />Listen to what you're saying.
5744989 5747324 It's paranoid delusion.
5747408 5751454 It's really sad. It's pathetic.
5752288 5755541 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
5755624 5758961 You don't see them fucking each other<br />over for a goddamn percentage.
5759962 5762339 All right.<br />We waste him. No offense.
5762465 5764133 No! He's gotta go back...
5766093 5768763 -They cut the power.<br />-What do you mean, they cut the power?
5769096 5770973 How could they cut the power, man?<br />They're animals.
5771015 5773476 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!
5773517 5775102 -RIPLEY: Gorman, watch Burke!<br />-I got him.
5775144 5776270 Newt, stay close.
5780816 5783486 -I'll go this side.<br />-You do that, man.
5785362 5788407 (tracker clicking)
5808385 5810554 -Anything?<br />-HUDSON: <i>There's something.</i>
5810971 5813849 -(beeping)<br />-It's inside the complex.
5814475 5815893 You're just reading me.
5817353 5818729 No, no, it ain't you.
5820856 5824568 They're inside...<br />Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
5824693 5827613 RIPLEY: <i>Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?</i>
5828572 5830866 (clicking)
5831784 5834203 (beeping)
5835329 5836539 Hudson may be right.
5837373 5839708 -Get back, both of you!<br />-HUDSON: The signal's weird.
5841293 5843546 Must be some interference<br />or something.
5844338 5845840 There's movement<br />all over the place!
5845881 5849218 Get back to operations.<br />It's game time.
5850219 5851387 Newt.
5853222 5856350 Seal the door. Hurry!
5856392 5859270 Come on! Come on!<br />Come on! Get back!
5860104 5861522 Work fast.
5865568 5867778 Cover your eyes, Newt.<br />Don't look at the light.
5868487 5871282 Movement. Signal's clean.
5871407 5873033 Range, 20 meters.
5873284 5875452 They found a way in,<br />something we missed.
5876078 5877580 We didn't miss anything.
5877997 5881417 Eighteen. Seventeen meters.
5881500 5884587 Something under the floor,<br />not in the plans. I don't know.
5884670 5886046 -Fifteen meters.<br />-Ripley!
5886589 5888132 Definitely inside the barricades.
5888465 5889592 Let's go.
5891510 5893095 -Thirteen meters.<br />-That's right outside the door.
5893137 5895806 -Hicks, Vasquez, get back!<br /><i>-Man, this is a big fucking signal.</i>
5896098 5897850 How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me.
5897933 5899184 Almost there.
5901186 5902438 That's it.
5903606 5908027 -Twelve meters. Eleven.<br />-(high-pitched beeping)
5908110 5910195 -Ten.<br />-Then they're right on us.
5910279 5911614 Nine meters.
5911655 5913574 Remember, short, controlled bursts.
5913782 5914992 Eight meters.
5917870 5919163 Seven.
5921040 5923667 -Six.<br />-It can't be. That's inside the room.
5923751 5925169 It's reading right, man. Look!
5925252 5926795 Well, you're not reading it right.
5929548 5933344 HUDSON: Five meters, man.<br />Four. What the hell?
5934470 5936180 (beeping continues)
5937181 5940184 -Oh, my God. Oh, sh...<br />-Give me the light.
5955115 5956325 (shouting)
5958827 5960329 There they go!<br />Over there! Get them!
5961497 5964833 -(aliens shrieking)<br />-Come on! Get them!
5966460 5968170 Do something, Gorman!
5969838 5971715 HUDSON:<br />Get them! Look out!
5971799 5973217 There's more of them!<br />There's more of them!
5973384 5977596 Medical! Get to medical!<br />Do it! Now!
5977888 5980724 HICKS: Hudson, look out!<br />Look out!
5982017 5984061 (shouts, screams)
5984853 5985938 Now!
5988065 5989400 Burke!
5992111 5993195 Open this door!
5993821 5995572 Burke! Open it!
5996657 5998575 (shouting)
5998659 6000452 Go! Fall back!
6003122 6005290 -Go!<br />-(shouting)
6005541 6006792 Die, motherfucker!

6012214 6016844 Motherfucker! Come on! Come on!<br />Come and get it, baby! Come on!
6016885 6020931 I don't got all day! Come on! Come on!<br />Come on, you bastard!
6021056 6022266 -Come on! You, too!<br />-(shrieking continues)
6022349 6023434 Oh, you want some of this?

6043746 6045205 It's locked!
6063474 6065434 Got it! Let's go! Let's go!
6065517 6066727 Go! Go!
6069396 6070606 Move, Gorman!
6070856 6072149 Seal it!

6092544 6095005 -Ripley, this way!<br />-What...
6096465 6097591 Wait. Get behind me.
6098133 6099968 Whatever you're gonna do,<br />do it fast!
6103597 6105808 -Hicks!<br />-Go! Come on. Let's go.
6107684 6108852 Move!
6116026 6117653 Which way is it<br />to the landing field from here?
6117694 6118987 This way.
6121990 6123075 (aliens shrieking)
6123951 6125661 NEWT: Go right.
6129498 6131166 This way. This way.
6140384 6141677 Which way?
6141760 6143178 Straight ahead and left.
6144012 6147057 Bishop, do you read me?<br />Come in. Over.
6147141 6148934 BISHOP: <i>The ship is on its way.</i>
6149017 6152104 E.T.A., 16 minutes.
6152187 6154606 Good. Stand by there.<br />We're on our way.
6166451 6168036 -Which way now?<br />-That way.
6168162 6170038 No, wait. This way.
6170122 6171331 You sure?
6173208 6174376 Vasquez, move!

6335620 6337164 Ripley!
6338040 6340042 Where are you?<br />Can you hear me?
6341376 6343211 -Newt!<br />-Here!
6343253 6345589 -I'm here!<br />-Where?
6350302 6352054 Newt, are you okay?
6353388 6355682 (grunts) We'll have to cut it.
6355724 6358310 Climb down, honey.<br />We've gotta cut through.
6367069 6368320 Newt?
6369071 6371073 Now, don't move.<br />Stay very still.
6371990 6373325 Okay.
