307765 310768 Well, there goes<br />our salvage, guys.
337211 340339 How are we today?<br />Ohh. Terrible.
340422 343299 Well, better than<br />yesterday, at least.

346220 348639 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
348722 352142 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're okay.
352226 354728 Oh, looks like<br />you've got a visitor.
356605 358940 Jonesy. Come here.
360109 362236 Hey, come here.
362319 364696 How are you,<br />you stupid cat?
364780 368700 How are you?<br />Where have you been?
368784 372621 Guess you two have met,<br />huh? I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
372705 377205 I work for the company, but don't let<br />that fool you. I'm really an okay guy.
378544 380462 I'm glad to see you’re<br />feeling a little better.
380546 384091 They tell me that all the weakness<br />and disorientation should pass soon.
384216 388716 That’s just natural side effects of such an<br />unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.
390180 392348 What do you mean?
392433 394810 How long<br />was I out there?

401483 405487 I don't... recognize<br />this place.
405571 407573 No, I know. Uh-
407656 411368 Okay. It's just that, uh,<br />this might be a shock to you.
411493 414078 It's long—<br />How long?
414163 416165 Please.
417166 421128 57 years.<br />What?
421211 425465 That's the thing. You<br />were out there for 57 years.
425549 428677 What happened was you had<br />drifted right through the core systems.
428761 431597 And it's really<br />just blind luck...
431680 434891 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
434975 437268 It's one in a thousand,<br />really.
437353 441853 I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.<br />You could be floating out there forever.

554928 557388 Hi. Sorry I'm late. I've been<br />running behind all morning.
557473 560267 ls there any word<br />about my daughter?
560350 563770 Uh... I really think we should<br />worry about the hearing now.
563854 567232 'Cause we don't have a lot of time, okay?<br />I read your deposition, and it's great.
567316 570360 If you just stick to that, I think we'll<br />be fine. The thing to remember is,
570444 572404 there"re gonna be a lot<br />of heavyweights in there.
572488 574490 You've got feds and Interstellar<br />Commerce Commission,
574573 577659 Colonial Administration,<br />insurance company guys—
577743 580328 Do you have any news<br />about my daughter?
581830 586000 Well, we did come up with some<br />information. Why don't we sit down?
586085 589171 I was hoping to wait<br />until after the inquest.
589254 591256 Um-—
593258 597262 “Amanda Ripley-McClaren'—<br />married name, I guess—
597346 599514 “Age 66.”
599598 601933 And that was at<br />the time of her death,
603644 606313 which was two years ago.
607564 609649 I'm real sorry.
618784 620702 Amy.
623914 628414 She was cremated and interred at Westlake<br />Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.
628627 632005 No children. I checked.<br />[ Briefcase Closes |

652109 654361 [ Man #1 ]<br />I'd just like to go, uh—
654444 656612 Back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.
656738 660324 [Man #2 ] Is it in the file?<br />I don't understand this.
660409 662702 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
662786 665079 Now, how many different ways do<br />you want me to tell the same story?
666498 670998 Look at it from our<br />perspective, please.
671211 673213 Please?
675632 678092 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
678177 681013 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class star freighter,
681096 683556 a rather expensive piece<br />of hardware.
683640 686851 Forty-two million<br />in adjusted dollars.
686935 689687 That's minus payload,<br />of course.
689771 694150 The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates<br />some elements of your account,
694234 698734 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
699364 703864 an unsurveyed planet at that time,<br />that it resumed its course...
703994 708494 and was subsequently set for<br />self-destruct by you for reasons unknown.
708999 711334 Not for reasons unknown.<br />I told you.
711460 715960 We set down there on company orders to<br />get this thing, which destroyed my crew...
717257 719717 and your expensive ship.
719801 723471 The analysis team, which went over<br />the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
723555 726683 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
726767 730812 Good! That's because I blew<br />it out of the goddamn air lock,
732481 734566 like I said.
736318 740818 Are there any species like this<br />hostile organism on LV-426?
740989 743491 No. It's a rock.<br />No indigenous life.
745494 749080 Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply<br />while I was away?
749164 751541 Ma’am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
751625 754377 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
754461 758961 It was not from there. Do you<br />get it? We homed in on its beacon.
759132 761926 And found something<br />never recorded once...
762010 765513 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
765597 770097 - “A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host.” - Yes.
770477 774397 These are your words. “And<br />has concentrated acid for blood.”
774481 776733 That's right
776817 780737 Look. I can see<br />where this is going,
780821 783240 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
783365 786534 - Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all.<br />- Please. You're not listening to me.
786618 789120 Kane, the crew member—
789204 792916 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
793041 795084 Thousands. Thank<br />you. That will be all.
795168 797211 Goddamn it,<br />that's not all!
797296 801008 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
801091 803635 Then all of this— this bullshit<br />that you think is so important—
803719 807514 You can just kiss<br />all of that good-bye!
813270 815605 It is the finding<br />of this court of inquiry that...
815689 817774 Warrant Officer E. Ripley,
817858 820902 NOC 14472,
820986 823738 has acted with<br />questionable judgment...
823822 828243 and is unfit to hold an I.C.C.<br />license as a commercial flight officer.
829995 833415 Said license is hereby<br />suspended indefinitely.
835250 839587 Now, no criminal charges will<br />be filed against you at this time,
839671 841923 and you are released<br />on your own recognizance...
842007 844801 for a six-month period<br />of psychometric probation,
844885 849385 to include monthly review<br />by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.
852184 855061 These proceedings are closed.
866031 868158 That could have<br />been better.
868283 871703 Look, I think the—<br />Ripley?<br />Van Leuwen.
871787 875040 Why don't you<br />just check out LV-426?
875123 878876 Because I don't have to. There have<br />been people there for over 20 years,
879002 883502 and they never complained about any hostile<br />organism. What do you mean? What people?
883757 886885 Terraformers.<br />Planet engineers.
886968 890721 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
890806 893058 Takes decades.
893141 895393 It's what we call<br />a “Shake 'N Bake” colony.
895477 899105 How many are there?<br />How many colonists?
899189 903689 I don't know— 60, maybe<br />70 families. Do you mind?

992449 994617 What? Remember you<br />sent some wildcatters...
994701 997537 out to the middle of nowhere last<br />week, out past the ilium Range?
997621 1001499 - Yeah, what?<br />- One of them's on the horn, a mom-and-pop survey team.
1001583 1004335 He says he's onto something. He<br />wants to know if his claim will be honored.
1004419 1006462 Why wouldn't his claim<br />be honored?
1006588 1009632 Well, because you sent them to that particular<br />middle-of-nowhere on company orders, maybe.
1009758 1013261 I don't know. Christ! Some<br />hooch in a cushy office on Earth...
1013345 1015472 says, “Go look at<br />a grid reference.”
1015555 1018766 We look. They don't<br />say why, and I don't ask.
1018892 1022979 I don't ask, because it takes two weeks to get<br />an answer out here, and the answer is always—
1023063 1024939 [ Together ]<br />“'Don't ask.”
1025065 1027192 So what do I tell<br />this guy?<br />[ Sighs ]
1027275 1030486 Tell him as far as I'm concerned,<br />if he finds something, it is his.

1110400 1113361 I'm not sure.
1113486 1117281 Let's see if we can't get a closer look at this<br />thing, maybe through that crack there on the side.
1117365 1121494 - Shouldn't we call in?<br />- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.
1124122 1127583 [ Brakes Hiss ]<br />[Dad ] That's about as close as we can get.
1127667 1130753 Should we take<br />a look inside?

1298046 1301758 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
1308223 1310433 I don't believe this.
1310558 1315058 You guys throw me at the wolves, and<br />now you want me to go back out there?
1315188 1317773 Forget it.<br />It's not my problem.
1317899 1321485 Can I finish? No.<br />There's no way.
1322904 1324989 Ripley, you wouldn't be<br />going in with the troops.
1325073 1327408 I can guarantee<br />your safety.
1327492 1329994 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough hombres.
1330078 1332955 They're packing<br />state-of-the-art firepower.
1333039 1334206 There's nothing<br />they can't handle.

1338002 1340170 We've been trained to<br />deal with situations like this.
1340255 1343925 Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
1344008 1346593 [ Burke ] Yeah, but we don't know<br />exactly what's going on out there.

1369534 1372036 Yeah, yeah.<br />I saw the commercial.
1372120 1375039 Look, I don't have time for<br />this. I've got to get to work.
1375123 1378251 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
1378334 1380336 That's right.
1380461 1383130 Running loaders and forklifts,<br />that sort of thing? Yeah. So?
1383214 1386383 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
1386467 1388969 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
1389053 1390888 There's nothing wrong<br />with it.
1394142 1396602 What would you say if I told<br />you I could get you reinstated...
1396686 1398646 as a flight officer?
1398771 1403233 The company's already agreed<br />to pick up your contract. If I go.

1406362 1408530 Come on.<br />That's a second chance, kiddo.
1408615 1411367 I think, personally, for you, it<br />would be the best thing in the world...
1411451 1414328 to get out there and face this<br />thing, get back on the horse.
1414412 1417331 Spare me, Burke. I've had<br />my psych evaluation this month.
1417457 1421544 Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every<br />night. Your sheets are soaking with sweat—

1710458 1712877 Not enough to have to<br />wake up to your face, Drake.
1712960 1713460 What?
1714837 1716088 Is that a joke?
1716172 1718257 Oh, I wish it were.
1718341 1722841 Hey, Hicks. Man, you<br />look just like I feel.<br />[ Grunts ]
1723346 1727224 - [ Coughing ] - All right,<br />sweethearts. What are you waiting for?
1727308 1730436 Breakfast in bed? Another<br />glorious day in the corps.
1730519 1734022 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm—
1734106 1738606 Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck<br />a fortune, every formation a parade.
1739195 1740863 I love the corps!<br />Christ!
1740947 1742782 Man, this floor is freezing!
1742907 1747077 What do you want me to do? Fetch your slippers<br />for ya? Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1747161 1750414 Look into my eye.<br />Fall in, people.
1750498 1752750 Come on. Let's go.
1752833 1754793 I hate this job.
1754919 1757588 Crowe, Wierzbowski. Come on. On<br />your feet. We got some slack coming, right?
1757672 1760549 You had three weeks on your<br />back, Frost. What do you want?
1760633 1763010 [ Frost] I'm talking about<br />breathing, not this frozen shit.
1763094 1765387 [ Dietrich ]<br />Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?
1768516 1772686 [Apone ] All right. First<br />assembly's in 15, people. Shag it.
1773938 1776565 Hey, mira.<br />Who's Snow White?
1776649 1780110 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1780194 1782446 Apparently,<br />she saw an alien once.
1782530 1785574 Whoopee-fuckin'-do!<br />Hey, I'm impressed.
1785658 1787701 ¡Que bonita!
1790037 1794166 Hey, Vasquez. Have you<br />ever been mistaken for a man?
1794250 1796293 No. Have you?
1796377 1800877 Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez.<br />You're just too bad.
1801924 1803634 Uhh!
1803718 1806011 [ Chattering ]
1812059 1814603 Hey, Top,<br />what's the op?
1814687 1816814 It's a rescue mission.<br />You'll love it.
1816897 1821397 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1821694 1823862 [ Spunkmeyer ]<br />Dumb-ass colonists.
1826449 1830077 What's this crap<br />supposed to be? Vasquez.
1830202 1833288 Corn bread, | think. It’s<br />good for you, boy. Eat it.
1833372 1836375 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting<br />some more of that Arcturian poontang.
1836459 1840959 - Remember that time?<br />- Yeah. Except the one that you had was male.
1841672 1844257 Doesn't matter<br />when it's Arcturian.
1844383 1846802 Hey, Bishop, man. Do the<br />thing with the knife. Oh, please.
1846927 1849346 Oh, come on. Yeah.<br />[ All Goading ]
1849430 1851390 All right! Yeah.
1851474 1855060 - I don't want to see that, man.<br />- Come on, man.<br />All right. All right.
1855144 1858105 Hey, what are you doing, man?<br />What are you doing?
1858230 1860357 Come on. Quit messing<br />around, Drake. Hudson, shut up!
1860441 1863026 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- [ Drake ] Do it, Bishop!
1863110 1866696 Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing<br />around! Yeah, you! Don't move.
1866781 1869074 Trust me.
1870368 1872286 Aah!
1880795 1883756 [Apone ] All right.<br />Knock it off, knock it off.
1883839 1885841 - Thank you.<br />- [ Drake Chuckles ]
1888302 1890304 There you go, short<br />shit. Enjoy your meal.
1890388 1893140 That wasn't funny, man.
1896685 1899813 Lieutenant Gorman?<br />Mr. Burke? Yeah, thanks.
1899897 1904397 Looks like the new lieutenant's too<br />good to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1906487 1909656 Boy's definitely got<br />a corncob up his ass.
1910741 1913452 [ Burke ] Thought you<br />never miss, Bishop.
1916747 1919541 You never said anything about an<br />android being on board. Why not?
1919625 1923670 [ Chuckles ] It never—<br />never occurred to me.
1923754 1926840 It's just common practice. We<br />always have a synthetic on board.
1926924 1929384 I prefer the term<br />“artificial person” myself.
1929468 1931344 Right.
1931429 1934098 - Is there a problem?<br />- [ Burke ] I'm sorry.
1934181 1936099 I don't know why<br />I didn't even—
1936183 1939603 Ripley's last trip out, the syn—<br />the artificial person malfunctioned.
1939687 1944187 - Malfunctioned?<br />- There were problems and a few deaths were involved.
1944650 1947861 I'm shocked.<br />Was it an older model?
1947945 1950614 The Hyperdyne Systems<br />120-A2.
1950698 1953283 That explains it then.<br />The A2s always were a bit twitchy.
1953367 1956078 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1956162 1960662 It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission<br />of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.
1960833 1965045 - You sure you don't want some?<br />- [ Clattering ]
1965129 1967714 You just stay away from me,<br />Bishop. You got that straight?
1970509 1973845 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1977766 1980852 [ Chattering |
1987193 1991322 [ Apone ] Squad, ten-hut!<br />Officer on deck! As you were.
1991405 1994241 Quickly, quickly.<br />Settle down.
1994325 1997328 All right.<br />Listen up!
1997411 2001911 Morning, marines. I"m sorry we didn't have time<br />to brief you people before we left Gateway—
2002583 2005043 [ Hudson ] Sir?<br />What is it, Hicks?
2005127 2008213 Hudson, sir.<br />He's Hicks.
2008297 2011216 What's the question?
2011300 2015095 Is this gonna be a stand-up<br />fight, sir, or another bug hunt?
2015179 2019266 All we know is that there's<br />still no contact with the colony...
2019350 2022186 and that a xenomorph<br />may be involved.
2022311 2025022 Excuse me, sir.<br />A what?<br />A xenomorph.
2025105 2027357 It's a bug hunt.
2027441 2031941 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
2032238 2034657 I'll tell you<br />what I know.
2034740 2037159 We set down<br />on LV-426.
2037243 2041247 One of our crew members was brought back on<br />board with something attached to his face,
2041330 2043832 some kind of parasite.
2043916 2046251 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
2046335 2049254 Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.
2049338 2051882 Kane seemed fine.
2051966 2054093 We were all having dinner,<br />and, um,
2054176 2058305 it must have laid something inside<br />his throat, some sort of embryo.
2058430 2062392 He started— Um, he—<br />[Vasquez ] Look, man.
2062476 2066976 I only need to know one<br />thing— where they are.
2067648 2070400 Yo, Vasquez.<br />Kick ass.<br />Anytime, anywhere.
2070484 2074984 Right, right. Somebody said “alien.” She<br />thought they said “illegal alien” and signed up.
2075447 2077407 Fuck you, man.<br />Anytime, anywhere.
2077491 2080118 Are you finished?
2085291 2088002 I hope you're right.<br />I really do.
2090254 2093298 Yeah, okay, right.<br />Thank you, Ripley.
2093382 2096301 We also have Ripley's report<br />on disk. I suggest you study it.
2096427 2100927 Because just one of those things managed to<br />wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
2101390 2104142 And if the colonists have found<br />that ship, then there's no felling...
2104226 2105894 how many of them<br />have been exposed.
2105978 2108397 Do you understand?
2110149 2113402 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />SO you better look at it.
2113485 2116154 Any questions?
2116238 2118615 What is it, Private?
2118699 2121702 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
2121785 2123536 You secure that shit,<br />Hudson.
2126206 2128291 All right.
2128375 2131211 Now listen up.
2132588 2134715 I want this thing<br />to go smooth...
2134798 2137342 and by the numbers.
2137426 2141847 I want D.C.S. and tactical<br />database assimilation by 0830.
2141972 2144933 [ All Scoffing ] Ordinance loading,<br />weapons strip and drop-ship prep details...
2145059 2147436 will have seven<br />hours. Oh, come on.
2147519 2149687 Now, move it,<br />people!
2149772 2152483 All right, sweethearts. You heard<br />the man, and you know the drill.
2152566 2156778 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
2172002 2174004 I don't care if you are<br />short, Hudson. Get it done.
2174088 2176673 Hey, Sarge. You'll get<br />lip cancer smoking those.
2176757 2179885 Corporal, I want this<br />loading lock sealed. Now!
2180010 2182429 How many more you got,<br />Spunkmeyer? Last one.
2182513 2184556 Good. Take it away.

2201990 2204075 Clear behind.
2210249 2212876 Did you check number three?<br />Let me see that.
2212960 2216880 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
2216964 2219341 I don't know. Is there<br />anything you can do?
2222302 2224554 Well, I can drive<br />that loader.
2224638 2228308 I have a Class 2 rating.
2228392 2230477 Be my guest.

2347010 2349887 ls that understood? That's what<br />we gonna do, sweethearts. Yes, sir.
2349972 2352307 We are going to go<br />and get some.<br />Hey.

2572944 2575821 [ Frost ] And I'm telling you, I<br />got a bad feeling about this drop.
2575906 2579326 [ Crowe ] You always say that, Frost. You always<br />say, “I got a bad feeling about this drop.”
2579409 2581828 [ Frost ] Okay, okay. When<br />we get back without you,
2581953 2584956 I'll call your folks.<br />[ Laughs ]<br />[ Beeping ]

2596718 2599011 Drake, check your camera.<br />There seems to be a malfunction.
2600388 2603682 That's better.<br />Pan it around a bit.

3059806 3064306 [ Hudson ] Uh, sir, uh, we have a negative<br />situation here. Uh, movin' on, sir.
3065019 3067563 [ Clicking ]
3073987 3076948 Wait Wait<br />tell him to—
3077949 3081661 Hicks, back up.<br />Pan right.
3082829 3087329 - There.<br />- You seeing this all right?
3088501 3093001 Looks melted. Somebody must have<br />bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.
3094132 3096092 Acid for blood.
3096175 3099761 If you like that,<br />you're gonna love this.
3106811 3108813 [ Hocking ]
3112942 3114652 Quit screwing around.
3114736 3116487 Second squad,<br />what's your status?
3116571 3119699 [ Hicks ] Uh, we just finished<br />our sweep. Nobody's home.
3119782 3122367 Roger.<br />Sir, this place is dead.
3122452 3125079 Whatever happened here,<br />I think we missed it.
3125163 3129167 [ Sighs ] All right. The area's secured. Let's<br />go in and see what their computer can tell us.
3129250 3132086 - Wait a minute. I's not secure.<br />- The area's secured, Ripley.
3132170 3133963 First team,<br />head for operations.
3135381 3138300 Hudson, see if you can get<br />their C.P.U. on line. Affirmative.
3138426 3141887 Hicks, meet me at the south<br />lock. We're coming in. Roger.
3141971 3145265 He's comin' in.<br />I feel safer already.
3145350 3147393 Pendejo jerk-off.
3167455 3171417 [ Hudson On Radio ] Sir, we got<br />the C.P.U. on line. No problem.
3171501 3174212 Good. Stand by<br />in Operations.
3175213 3177256 Okay, let's go.
3197610 3199278 Are you all right?
3200488 3202156 Yes.
3218756 3222760 Sir, they sealed off<br />this wing at both ends,
3222844 3226097 welded the doors and blocked<br />off the stairs with heavy equipment.
3226180 3230184 [ Gorman ] Mm-hmm. But it<br />looks like the barricade didn't hold.
3230309 3232436 Any bodies?<br />No, sir.
3232520 3234438 Last stand.
3234522 3236982 [ Drake ] Must have<br />been a hell of a fight.
3237066 3239693 Yeah, looks that way.
3241612 3243739 [ Gorman ]<br />All right, Drake, this way.
3243823 3246826 We should be able to cut<br />through the medilab to Operations.
3298628 3300546 [ Hicks ]<br />Lieutenant.
3302381 3304383 Gorman.
3321275 3322943 Are those the same ones that—
3336207 3338250 Careful, Burke.
3347844 3351764 Looks like love<br />at first sight to me.

3369115 3373285 [ Clicking, Beeping ]<br />Yo, Hicks.
3373369 3375913 I think we got<br />something here.

3383921 3387424 Apone, where are your people?<br />Anybody in 'D' block?
3387508 3390344 [ Apone On Radio ] Ah, that's a<br />negative. We're all in Operations.

3415870 3417830 It's moving.<br />Which way?
3417914 3421459 It's coming straight<br />for us. Straight up.

3661157 3663492 Try this.
3663576 3665911 It's a little<br />hot chocolate.
3667413 3669832 There you go.
3669915 3672125 Whoop.
3672209 3674169 That good, huh?
3678549 3682010 Uh-oh. I made<br />a clean spot here.
3682094 3685889 Now I've done it. Guess I'll<br />have to do the whole thing.
3695441 3698986 Hard to believe there's<br />a little girl under all this.
3700988 3703156 And a pretty one too.

3770391 3774103 Casey.<br />Hello, Casey.
3774186 3777147 What about your brother?<br />What's his name?
3777231 3779274 Timmy.
3779358 3783820 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?

3880751 3883336 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't pa yin' us by the hour.

3885464 3887466 Okay, Frost,<br />you're driving.
3899269 3902730 It's okay. Don't worry.<br />It'll be okay.
3943272 3947276 [ Gorman On Radio ] I want a straight<br />“V” deployment, second team on left flank.
3947359 3951404 Advance on axial 664.<br />Tracker on line.
3951488 3954616 Set the “V” gain<br />to filter R.F. ambient.

3960038 3964208 [ Gorman ] Forty meters in, bearing<br />221, there should be a stairwell.
3964293 3966253 Check. Got it.
3967713 3969631 [ Gorman ]<br />You want Sublevel 3.
3971842 3974094 [ Apone ] Let's go, people.<br />Hudson, you got the point.
3974178 3976555 Hicks, watch our tails.
3976638 3979807 Nice and easy.<br />Check those corners.
3979892 3982144 Check those corners.
3985522 3988149 Watch your spacing.<br />[ Apone ] All right. You heard the man.
3988233 3990151 Don't bunch up.<br />Stay loose.
3990235 3992987 [ Gorman ] Uh, your transmission's<br />showing a lot of breakup.
3993071 3997283 [ Hudson ] Probably getting some<br />interference from the structure.
3997367 3999494 [ Apone ]<br />Use those lights.
3999578 4003957 [ Gorman ] Next one<br />down, and proceed on a 216.
4004041 4006209 [Apone ]<br />Uh, roger. That's a 216.
4008420 4011423 [ Gorman ] I'm not making that<br />out too well. What is it, Hudson?
4011507 4014468 You tell me, man.<br />I only work here.
4029566 4031651 What is that?
4031735 4033945 I don't know.
4035656 4037949 Proceed inside.
4053757 4056634 [ Apone On Headset ] Watch<br />your fire and check your targets.
4056718 4059053 Remember we're looking<br />for civvies in here.
4068855 4070773 [ Apone ]<br />Easy.
4070857 4073317 [ Hicks ] Tighten it up, Frost.<br />We're getting a little thin.
4075112 4077405 [Apone ]<br />Nice and easy.
4079700 4081618 Looks like some sort<br />of secreted resin.
4081702 4085497 Yeah, but secreted<br />from what?
4085581 4088250 Nobody touch nothing.
4088333 4091294 Busy little<br />creatures, huh?
4091378 4093630 Hot as hell in here.
4093714 4095632 Yeah, man,<br />but it's a dry heat.
4095716 4097676 [Apone ]<br />Knock it off, Hudson.
4105601 4108937 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
4109021 4111398 Ten millimeter<br />explosive-tip case less.
4111481 4113441 Standard light<br />armor-piercing round.
4113525 4115777 Why?<br />Well, look where your team is.
4115861 4119114 They're right under the<br />primary heat exchangers.
4119197 4121199 So?
4121283 4124995 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
4125078 4129332 - Ho, ho, ho. Yeah.<br />She's absolutely right.<br />- 307 So what?
4129416 4133628 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
4133712 4136089 Right?
4136173 4140673 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and adios, muchachos.
4140927 4143554 Oh, great. Wonderful.
4143639 4146433 Shit!

4152314 4153481 [ Snapping Fingers ]
4153565 4156985 Look. We can't have<br />any firing in there.
4157069 4160822 I, uh, I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
4160906 4164951 - Is he fuckin' crazy?<br />- What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?
4165035 4167871 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I-
4167954 4170915 Just do it, Sergeant.<br />And no grenades.
4172626 4176713 All right, sweethearts. You heard the<br />man. Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.

4505667 4507877 [ Vasquez ] On the<br />right, man. Uh, Apone,
4507961 4510713 I want you to lay down<br />a suppressing fire with the incinerators—
4510797 4513549 Vasquez, Drake, hold<br />your fire, goddamn it!
4513633 4517553 [ Gorman ] Apone, are you copying me?<br />I want you to lay down suppressing fire...
4517637 4520139 with the incinerators and fall<br />back by squads to the A.P.C.
4520265 4522642 Over. Say again,<br />all after “incinerator.”
4522726 4527226 I said I want you to lay down a suppressing<br />fire with the incinerators and fall back...
4527522 4530066 by squads to the<br />A.P.C. Over. [ Gunfire |
4530984 4532026 Hey!

4533987 4536406 - [ Hudson ] Sarge! Sarge!<br />- Apone.
4536489 4538908 Talk to me. Apone?<br />Copy! Copy!
4538992 4541285 Talk to me, Apone.<br />He's gone!
4542954 4545331 Get them out of there!<br />Shut up!
4545457 4548334 Do it now! Hicks,<br />whoever's left, get— Shut up!
4548460 4550336 Just shut up!<br />Goddamn it!
4550462 4554883 It's coming out of the goddamn<br />walls! Where's Apone? Where's Apone?
4554966 4557259 The sarge is gone!<br />Let's get the fuck out of here!
4557343 4561138 Let's move it!<br />Let's go, marine!
4561222 4564308 Hudson? Vasquez?
4564434 4567520 Hudson, look out!<br />Get it!
4568646 4570648 [ Alien Screeching ]<br />Watch it!
4570732 4573109 Hicks. Come on.<br />Behind you! Fall back!
4573234 4576695 I told them to fall back.<br />[ Hicks ] Fall back, goddamn it, now!
4576821 4578697 They're cut off!<br />[ Hicks ] Hudson, move your ass!
4578823 4580699 Do something!<br />[ Hicks ] Let's go, marine!
4580784 4582744 Fuck!

4821899 4824151 You okay?
4825528 4827571 I'm all right.<br />Hudson.
4827655 4829698 Get away from me, man!
4829824 4833828 Lieutenant. What<br />happened to Gorman?
4833911 4837164 I don't know.<br />Maybe a concussion.
4837248 4839541 But he's alive.<br />He's dead!
4839625 4841710 Wake up, pendejo, and then<br />I'm gonna kill you!
4841794 4845005 Back off.<br />Right now.

4849719 4852847 Hey. Hey, look.
4852930 4856224 The sarge and Dietrich<br />aren't dead, man.
4856309 4858311 Their signs are real low,<br />but they ain't dead.
4858394 4860646 - Then we go back in there and get them.<br />- Fuck that!
4860772 4863149 We don't leave our people behind—<br />I ain't going back in there.
4863232 4865692 You can't help them!
4865777 4870277 You can't. Right now they're<br />being cocooned just like the others.
4874744 4878998 Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this<br />ain't happenin', man. Damn it.
4879082 4882168 This can't be happenin', man.<br />This isn't happenin'!
4882251 4885796 All right. We got<br />seven canisters of CN-20.
4885880 4889216 I say we roll them in there and<br />nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4889300 4892094 That's worth a try, but we don't<br />even know if it's gonna affect them.
4892178 4896640 Let's just bug out and call it even.<br />Okay? What are we talking about this for?
4896724 4900436 I say we take off and nuke<br />the entire site from orbit.
4903314 4905232 It's the only way<br />to be sure.
4905316 4908569 Fuckin' “A”! Hold on.<br />Hold on one second.
4908653 4912823 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4912907 4915409 They can bill me.
4915493 4919993 Okay, look. This is an emotional<br />moment for all of us, okay?
4920623 4924043 I know that. But let"s not<br />make shap judgments, please.
4924127 4927088 This is clearly— clearly an<br />important species we're dealing with,
4927171 4929923 and I don't think that you or<br />I or anybody has the right...
4930007 4933093 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4933177 4934720 Yeah. Watch us.
4934804 4937097 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4937181 4939850 but we just got<br />our asses kicked, pal!
4939934 4943270 Look. I'm not blind<br />to what's going on,
4943354 4945939 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action.
4946023 4948108 I'm sorry.
4949235 4952154 Well, I believe<br />Corporal Hicks...
4952238 4954198 has authority here.
4955700 4957618 Corporal Hicks is—
4957702 4960079 This operation is under<br />military jurisdiction,
4960163 4962081 and Hicks is next<br />in chain of command.
4962165 4964333 Am I right, Corporal?
4964417 4966377 Yeah.
4967545 4970047 Yeah, that's right.
4970173 4972216 Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />Yes.
4972300 4974760 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4974844 4976762 He can't make<br />that kind of decision.
4976846 4979431 He's just a grunt.<br />Uh, no offense.
4979515 4983268 None taken. Ferro, do<br />you copy? Standing by.

5004207 5007752 Let's go. Pick it up,<br />Hudson. Pick it up, baby.

5030942 5033235 [ Ferro ]<br />Just get up here.
5033319 5035821 I'm in. Ramp closing.
5055550 5057510 Spunkmeyer.
5058719 5062389 Goddamn it.<br />[ Door Opens ]

5077572 5079490 Run!
5120364 5124159 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
5124243 5126703 Now what the fuck<br />are we supposed to do?
5126787 5129080 we’re in some<br />real pretty shit now, man!
5129165 5131542 Are you finished?
5134378 5136338 You all right?
5141552 5145764 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
5145848 5147432 I'm sorry, Newt.
5147558 5151478 You don't have to be sorry. It<br />wasn't your fault. That's it, man.
5151562 5153939 Game over, man!<br />Game over!
5154023 5156650 What the fuck are we gonna<br />do now? What are we gonna do?
5156734 5161155 Maybe we could build a fire. Sing a couple<br />of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?
5161238 5163990 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
5164075 5167453 and they mostly<br />come at night, mostly.
5184261 5188265 That's everything, right? All<br />right. This is absolutely everything...
5188349 5191352 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
5191435 5195021 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
5195106 5197233 That ain't so good.
5197316 5201028 We got, uh,<br />15 of these M-40 grenades.
5201112 5203030 Don't touch that.
5203155 5205615 Dangerous, honey. Is<br />that the only flamethrower?
5205700 5209745 [ Hicks ] Yeah. It's only<br />half full, but it's functional.
5209829 5213582 Got another one, it's damaged-<br />I don't know about that one.
5213666 5218166 But the good news— we got<br />four of these robot sentries,
5219547 5222591 with display<br />and scanners intact.
5222675 5225844 They really kick ass.<br />I think they'll come in handy.
5225928 5230349 How long after we're declared<br />overdue can we expect a rescue?
5232393 5234520 Seventeen days.
5235521 5238065 Seventeen days?
5238149 5242027 Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your<br />parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
5242111 5245739 Those things are gonna come in here like<br />they did before. They're gonna come in here—
5245865 5248951 Hudson! Hudson! They're gonna<br />come in here and they're gonna get us!
5249034 5251077 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
5251162 5254206 with no weapons<br />and no training.
5254290 5256208 Right?
5258586 5261297 Why don't you<br />put her in charge?
5261380 5264216 You'd better just start dealing<br />with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
5264300 5266468 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
5266552 5268470 And I'm sick<br />of your bullshit.
5268554 5272140 Now, I want you to get on a terminal<br />and call up some kind of floor plan file.
5272224 5274935 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints.<br />I don’t care.
5275019 5277354 Anything that shows the layout<br />of this place. Are you listening?
5277480 5280566 Yeah.<br />I need to see air ducts.
5280649 5284027 I need to see electrical<br />access tunnels, subbasements,
5284111 5287823 every possible way<br />info this complex.
5287907 5292369 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
5292495 5294788 Okay, I'm on it.<br />Hudson!
5294872 5299372 - Just relax.<br />- [ Exhales Sharply ]
5302963 5307463 I'll be in med lab. I'll check on<br />Gorman, continue my analysis.
5308093 5311012 Fine.<br />You do that.
5317228 5321065 So this service tunnel must be<br />how they're moving back and forth.
5321148 5323650 That's right. It moves from<br />the processing station...
5323734 5326069 right into<br />the sublevel here.
5328113 5331449 Come down on that.<br />Okay, come over.
5331534 5334745 Hold. Go back. Okay,<br />punch that in right there.
5340417 5342460 No. It's back here.<br />Okay.
5344004 5346631 Well, there's a<br />pressure door at this end.
5346757 5351257 Couldn't we put one of the remote sentry<br />units in the tunnel and then seal that door?
5351470 5354473 Yeah, that'll work, but we gotta<br />figure on them getting into the complex.
5354557 5359057 That's right, SO we repair the<br />barricades at these two intersections.
5359687 5362356 Right. And weld plate<br />steel over these ducts...
5362439 5366818 here and here and here.
5366902 5369905 That way they can only come<br />at us from these two corridors.
5369989 5374489 All right. Then we put the other<br />sentry units here and here, right?
5375786 5378246 Right<br />Outstanding.
5378330 5380290 Now all we need<br />is a deck of cards.
5382585 5384670 All right, people. Let"s<br />move like we got a purpose.
5384795 5387547 [ Hudson ]<br />Affirmative. Affirmative.
5399143 5402729 [ Beeping ]
5402813 5406483 Do your thing, baby. Come on,<br />Vasquez. Let's get the hell outta here.
5406567 5409444 Hudson here. “A” and “B”<br />sentries are in place and keyed.
5409528 5414028 Roger. Stand by. Arming<br />now. Test it, Hudson.
5414491 5416868 Do it!<br />Fire in the hole!
5420122 5422916 Okay, great. Let's<br />get the hell outta here!
5423000 5426461 We're sealing the tunnel.<br />Come on, baby.
5428505 5430340 [ Welder Crackling ]
5438641 5440559 For what it's worth.
5442519 5444812 Here. I want you<br />to put this on.
5446190 5448442 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
5448525 5451986 Then I can find you anywhere<br />in the complex on this.
5452071 5453697 [ Beeping ]
5453822 5457909 It's just a precaution. Thanks.
5457993 5460787 Doesn't mean we're<br />engaged or anything.
5460871 5462873 All right,<br />what's next?
5469713 5473758 [ Beeping ]
5487398 5489983 [ Door Closes ]
5492486 5494529 Last stop.
5498534 5500452 Get in.
5500536 5504623 Scoot down.<br />That's good.
5504707 5508752 Now, you lie here and<br />have a nap. You're very tired.
5508836 5512214 I don't want to.<br />I have scary dreams.
5514591 5517677 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
5517761 5519679 Let's take a look.
5519763 5522098 Nope. Nothing bad<br />in there.
5522182 5526477 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
5526562 5529064 Ripley, she doesn't<br />have bad dreams...
5529148 5532192 because she's just<br />a piece of plastic.
5532276 5535779 Right.<br />I'm sorry, Newt.
5542494 5544746 There.
5544830 5547707 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters—
5547791 5551127 No real ones—<br />but there are.
5552463 5554423 Yes, there are,<br />aren't there?
5556508 5558843 Why do they tell<br />little kids that?
5560721 5562639 Most of the time<br />it's true.
5562723 5566184 Did one of those things<br />grow inside her?
5566268 5569062 I don't know, Newt.
5569146 5571106 That's the truth.
5571190 5575690 Isn't that how babies come?<br />I mean, people babies?
5575903 5579448 They grow inside you.<br />Oh, that's very different.
5579531 5581449 Did you ever<br />have a baby?
5581533 5584827 Yes, I did.<br />I had a little girl.
5584953 5589453 Where is she?<br />She's gone.
5591335 5593295 You mean dead.
5594880 5595839 Here.
5597216 5599051 Take this.
5600552 5602512 For luck.
5605724 5607684 There's that.
5609853 5611771 Don’t go, please.
5611855 5615400 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
5615484 5617402 And you see that camera<br />right up there?
5617486 5620280 I can see you<br />right through that camera,
5620364 5622699 all the time<br />to see if you're safe.
5627079 5629748 I'm not gonna<br />leave you, Newt.
5629832 5633752 I mean that.<br />That's a promise.
5633836 5636505 You promise?
5636588 5638881 I cross my heart.
5638966 5643261 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
5652229 5654189 [ Kisses ]
5658152 5662614 Now go to sleep,<br />and don't dream.

5685345 5687889 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
5687973 5690058 Let's go through it again.

5692436 5696773 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
5696857 5700694 Which would mean that there would<br />have to be a lot of these parasites, right?
5700777 5702945 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
5703030 5704948 Yes. That follows.
5705032 5709077 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
5711622 5713540 So who's laying<br />these eggs?
5713624 5716710 I'm not sure.
5716793 5718753 It must be something<br />we haven"t seen yet.
5718837 5721047 Hey, maybe it's like<br />an ant hive.
5721131 5723174 Bees, man.<br />Bees have hives.
5723258 5727758 You know what I mean. There's, like,<br />one female that runs the whole show.
5728513 5730890 Yes, the queen.<br />Yeah, the mama.
5730974 5733309 She's badass, man.<br />I mean, big.
5733435 5735979 These things ain't ants,<br />estupido. I know that.
5736063 5740563 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
5740817 5743736 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
5743820 5747657 that they were to be kept alive in<br />stasis for return to the company labs.
5749868 5751828 He was very specific<br />about it.
5753247 5757251 Look. Those two specimens are worth<br />millions to the bio-weapons division, right?
5757334 5760712 Now, if you're smart, we can<br />both come out of this heroes,
5760796 5764007 and we will be<br />set up for life.
5765050 5767635 You're crazy, Burke.<br />Do you know that?
5767719 5771889 Do you really think you can get a dangerous<br />organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?
5771974 5774851 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
5774935 5777979 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
5778063 5782275 Just like they'll know that you were<br />responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.
5782401 5784820 Wait a second. You<br />sent them to that ship.
5784945 5787030 You're wrong. I just<br />checked the colony log.
5787114 5790992 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
5791076 5793995 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
5794121 5796540 Why didn't you warn<br />them, Burke? Okay, look.
5796623 5799125 What if that ship didn't even<br />exist? Do you ever think about that?
5799209 5802879 I didn't know. So now if I went and<br />made a major security situation out of it,
5803005 5806383 everybody steps in, administration steps in,<br />and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.
5806466 5810511 Nobody wins. So I made a<br />decision, and it was wrong.
5810595 5813306 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
5813432 5815100 Bad call?<br />Right.
5815183 5816809 These people<br />are dead, Burke!
5816893 5819312 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
5819396 5822315 I'm gonna make sure that they<br />nail you right to the wall for this!
5822399 5824651 You're not gonna sleaze<br />your way out of this one.
5824735 5826903 Right to the wall.
5828739 5829740 Ripley. I-
5829740 5831783 Ripley. I-
5831867 5833869 You know, I expected<br />more from you.
5833952 5836913 I thought you'd be<br />smarter than this.
5836997 5840375 Well, 'm happy<br />to disappoint you.
5847174 5849551 [Alarm Blaring ]
5853972 5856349 - [ Hudson ] What is it? What's going on?<br />- They're coming.
5856475 5858935 Where?<br />In the tunnel.
5859019 5860395 [ Automatic Gunfire ]
5860479 5864979 Here we go. “A” and “B” gun<br />tracking far end. Multiple targets.
5871740 5873616 Those ammo counters go.
5876286 5878413 “B” gun's down 50%.
5879581 5881833 Man, it's a shooting gallery<br />down there.
5885796 5887547 - [Hicks ] Sixty rounds left on 'B.”<br />- [ Beeping ]
5887631 5890800 Forty. Twenty. Ten.
5890884 5893136 “B” gun's dry.<br />Twenty on “A.”
5894388 5897599 - Ten. Five.<br />- [ Steady Beep ]
5900477 5902145 That's it.
5902229 5905482 Jesus, they were<br />wall-to-wall in there.
5906483 5909360 [ Pounding ]
5909444 5911446 They're at<br />the pressure door.
5913031 5914991 Man, listen to that.
5915075 5918745 Bishop here. I'm afraid<br />I have some bad news.
5918829 5919412 Well, that's a switch.
5922916 5925710 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5925794 5929339 That's it.<br />Emergency venting.
5929423 5933923 Oh, that's beautiful, man. Oh,<br />man, that— that just beats it all.
5934177 5937013 How long till it blows?<br />Four hours.
5937139 5940183 [ Groans ] With a blast<br />radius of 30 kilometers,
5940267 5943895 equal to about<br />40 megatons.
5944020 5947481 We got problems. [ Hudson ] I don"t<br />believe this. I don't fucking believe this.
5947566 5950068 Vasquez,<br />close the shutters.
5950152 5952320 Why can't we shut it<br />down from here?
5952404 5954322 I"m sorry. The crash<br />caused too much damage.
5954406 5956950 An overload is inevitable<br />at this point.
5957033 5959952 Oh, man, and I was<br />getting short.
5960036 5963372 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5963498 5965541 It ain't half fair, man.<br />Hudson, give us a break!
5965625 5968210 [ Hudson ]<br />Four more weeks. Oh, man.
5968295 5971506 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the Sulaco.
5971590 5974551 I mean, there must be some way<br />of bringing it down on remote.
5974634 5978137 How? The transmitter was<br />on the A.P.C. It's wasted.
5978263 5981474 I don't care how, but we'd better think<br />of something. We'd better think of a way.
5981600 5984436 Think of what? We're fucked!<br />We're doomed! Shut up!
5984519 5987313 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5987397 5990191 The uplink tower down at the<br />other end. Why can't we use that?
5990275 5993236 No, I checked. The hardware in<br />between here and there was damaged.
5993320 5995238 We can't align the dish.
5995322 5997741 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5997824 6000743 take a portable terminal, go<br />out there and patch in manually.
6000827 6005327 Oh, yeah, sure. With those things<br />running around? You can count me out.
6005999 6008001 Guess we can just count<br />you out of everything. I'll go.
6008084 6009877 [ Hudson ] That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?
6010003 6011838 [ Bishop ] I'll go.<br />What?
6011922 6016259 I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one<br />qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway.
6016343 6020722 Yeah, right, man. Bishop<br />should go. Good idea.
6020805 6022973 Believe me,<br />I'd prefer not to.
6023058 6025977 | may be synthetic,<br />but I'm not stupid.
6037739 6039657 [ Ripley ]<br />How long?
6039741 6042994 This conduit runs almost to<br />the uplink assembly— 180 meters.
6043119 6046413 Say 40 minutes to crawl<br />down there— [ Ripley ] Right
6046498 6050251 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
6051336 6053588 Thirty minutes<br />to prep the ship,
6053713 6056924 and about 50 minutes<br />flight time. I's gonna be close.
6061429 6064140 Good luck.<br />See you soon.
6065600 6069395 Watch your fingers.<br />[ Grunts ]
6070397 6071773 Vaya con Dios, man.
6085579 6090079 This is unbelievable.<br />Twenty meters and closing.
6090292 6092377 Fifteen.<br />How many?
6092460 6095045 [ Hicks ]<br />Can't tell. Lofts.
6096631 6099884 “D” gun's down 50%.
6099968 6101844 [Aliens Screeching ]
6101928 6105056 “C” gun's right behind it.
6107017 6110186 [ Hudson ] Stopping<br />them. It ain't stopping them.
6110270 6114770 - [ Hicks ] 150 rounds on "D.”<br />- [ Hudson ] Come on. Come on, baby.
6115358 6117651 [ Hicks ]<br />Hundred rounds.
6117736 6120405 [ Hudson ]<br />Come on! Come on!
6120488 6121697 [ Beeping ]
6125410 6126911 “D” gun's down to 20.
6128163 6130582 Ten.
6131833 6133251 Damn it!
6134878 6137881 Wait! They're retreating.
6143136 6145847 [ Ripley ]<br />The guns stopped them.
6147724 6149684 You're right.
6157067 6158985 Next time they walk<br />right up and knock.
6159069 6161029 Yeah, but they don't<br />know that.
6161112 6163864 They're probably looking<br />for other ways to get in.
6164908 6166784 That'll take 'em a while.
6166910 6169412 Maybe we got "em<br />demoralized. Shut up!
6170747 6173207 I want you two<br />walking perimeter.
6174793 6177378 Move!
6183593 6185803 Hey, listen.
6185887 6188806 We're all<br />in strung-out shape,
6188890 6192184 but stay frosty<br />and alert.
6193603 6196480 We can't afford to let<br />one of those bastards in here.
6196564 6198732 All right.<br />Vámonos.
6209619 6211621 How long’s it been<br />since you got any sleep?
6211705 6215333 Twenty-four hours?
6215417 6218711 Hicks, I'm not gonna<br />end up like those others.
6218795 6221631 You'll take care<br />of it, won't you?
6223216 6227716 If it comes to that,<br />I'll do us both.
6229472 6232183 Listen, let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that.
6232308 6235894 All right?<br />All right.
6235979 6240479 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
6241276 6245196 This is an M-41A<br />pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,
6245280 6249117 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
6249200 6251160 Feel the weight.
6258084 6260377 Okay, what do I do?
6265800 6268427 Okay, pull it in<br />tight here. Right.
6268553 6270846 Uh-huh. Lean into it. Mm-hmm.
6270930 6273599 All right.<br />Now, it will kick some.
6273683 6277228 All right. When the counter<br />reads zero here, you—
6277353 6279605 I press this up?<br />That's right.
6281691 6284819 Get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
6284944 6287947 Right. And you're<br />ready to rock and roll.
6288072 6290866 What's this? That's<br />the grenade launcher.
6290950 6293702 I don't think you<br />want to mess with that.
6293787 6297791 You started this.<br />Show me everything.
6297874 6299834 I can handle myself.
6301419 6303379 Yeah, I noticed.
6313515 6315475 How do you feel?
6315558 6319061 All right, I guess.<br />One hell of a hangover.
6320605 6322815 Look, Ripley, I<br />just want— Forget it.
6322899 6324859 Excuse me.
6377036 6379788 [ Newt Groaning ]
6379873 6384373 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.<br />It's okay. It's okay.
6455365 6458785 [ Whispering ]<br />Newt, wake up.
6458868 6460786 Wha—-<br />Be quiet.
6460870 6462872 We"re in trouble.
6480390 6482183 - No!<br />- [ Screams ]
6482266 6484935 Move, Newt!
6499951 6502954 [ Both Grunting ]
6505415 6507333 Hey!
6507417 6509752 [ No Audio ]
6516342 6520679 Help! Help!
6520763 6522723 Hicks!<br />Somebody!
6522807 6524725 [ Hicks ]<br />Say again, Bishop.
6524809 6528145 You've got it into auto-refuel<br />mode, and it's sequencing right?
6528271 6531274 [ Bishop On Radio I That's<br />right. Okay, good. Stay on it.
6531399 6534944 [ Indistinct ] Get back to me when<br />you've activated the launch cycle.
6535028 6538281 Roger.<br />He's at the uplink tower.
6538406 6540908 Good.<br />Terrific.
6542618 6545621 [ Ripley ] Hicks! Hicks!<br />Hicks! [ Newt ] Help!
6545705 6548290 - Help! Help!<br />- Hicks, help us!
6548374 6552461 - Break the glass! Break it. Break it.<br />- Yes.
6552545 6554547 I’ll try.
6568311 6569979 [ Scurrying ]
6571689 6574733 [ Clinking ]
6574817 6577277 Ripley, I'm scared.
6577361 6579363 Me too.
6584827 6586829 Stay here.
6595546 6598549 [Alarm Blaring ]
6598633 6601677 It's the med lab. Hudson!
6601761 6605097 Vasquez, meet me in med lab.<br />We got a fire.
6605181 6607183 [ Hudson On Radio ]<br />We"re on our way.
6610061 6612063 They're coming, Newt.
6617401 6619528 [ Screaming ]
6619612 6621780 - [ Grunts ]<br />- [ Screaming Continues ]
6621864 6623407 [ Grunts ]
6626661 6628871 [ Screaming ]
6632542 6634210 [ Gasping ]
6635628 6638839 [ Screaming Continues ]
6644637 6646722 Shoot it out!
6650726 6652602 - Hudson!<br />- Jesus.
6654564 6656107 [ Gasping ]
6656190 6658525 Christ, kid, look out!
6666450 6667451 Fucking die.
6679338 6682549 Over there! Ready?<br />Yeah! Yeah!
6682633 6684259 [ Hicks ]<br />Now!
6687763 6689639 Hudson?<br />Yeah. All clear.
6689765 6692309 Nailed the other one. It's<br />history, man. [ Coughing ]
6693728 6695646 Jesus.
6696814 6700400 Burke— [ Coughs ] It was Burke.
6702653 6705864 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
6705948 6708867 Just doesn't make<br />any goddamn sense.
6711829 6715874 He figured that he could get an<br />alien back through quarantine...
6715958 6718669 if one of us<br />was impregnated—
6719962 6722172 Whatever you call it-
6722256 6724841 and then frozen<br />for the trip home.
6724926 6728971 Nobody would know about<br />the embryos we were carrying—
6729055 6731098 Me and Newt.
6732934 6734894 Wait a minute, now.<br />We'd all know.
6734977 6737229 Yes. The only way<br />he could do it...
6737313 6741066 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
6741150 6743735 Namely yours.
6743819 6747697 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
6747782 6752282 Fuck! He's dead.<br />You're dog meat, pal.
6754163 6756081 This is so nuts.
6756165 6758792 I mean, listen—<br />Listen to what you're saying.
6758876 6761545 It's paranoid delusion.
6761629 6765966 Its really sad.<br />It's pathetic.
6766050 6769845 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
6769929 6773223 You don't see them fucking each<br />other over for a goddamn percentage.
6773307 6776435 All right.<br />We waste him. No offense.
6776519 6778187 No! He's gotta go back-
6780356 6782983 They cut the power. What do<br />you mean, they cut the power?
6783067 6784651 How could they cut the power, man?<br />They're animals.
6784735 6787320 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!
6787405 6789323 [ Ripley ] Gorman,<br />watch Burke! I got him.
6789407 6791700 Newt, stay close.
6795204 6798290 I'll go this side.<br />You do that, man.
6799292 6802295 [ Tracker Clicking ]
6822023 6824817 Anything?<br />[ Hudson ] There's something.
6824900 6828111 [ Beeping ]<br />It's inside the complex.
6828195 6830197 You're just reading me.
6831157 6833075 No, no, it ain't you.
6835244 6838914 They're inside— inside the<br />perimeter. They're in here.
6838998 6842459 [ Ripley ] Hudson,<br />stay cool! Vasquez?
6842543 6844586 [ Clicking ]
6845755 6849133 [ Beeping ]
6849216 6850800 Hudson may be right.
6850926 6854054 Get back, both of you!<br />[ Hudson ] The signal’s weird.
6855431 6858100 Must be some interference<br />or something.
6858184 6860102 There's movement<br />all over the place!
6860186 6863522 Get back to Operations.<br />It's game time.
6863606 6865983 Newt.
6867526 6870403 Seal the door.<br />Hurry!
6870488 6873949 Come on! Come on!<br />Come on! Get back!
6874033 6875951 Work fast.
6879330 6882499 Cover your eyes, Newt.<br />Don't look at the light.
6882583 6885586 Movement. Signal's clean.
6885669 6887587 Range, 20 meters.
6887671 6889839 They found a way in,<br />something we missed.
6889924 6891842 We didn't miss anything.
6891926 6895721 Eighteen.<br />Seventeen meters.
6895805 6898182 Something under the floor,<br />not in the plans. I don't know.
