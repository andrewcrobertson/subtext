299674 304221 Bio-readouts are in the green.<br />Looks like she's alive.
306723 309726 There goes our salvage.
336253 339297 - How are we today?<br />- Terrible.
339464 343510 - Better than yesterday, at least.<br />- Where am I?
343677 347556 You're safe. You're at Gateway Station,<br />been here two days.
347722 351268 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're OK.
351434 354187 Looks like you've got a visitor.
355689 357941 Jonesy. Come here.
359109 361111 Come here.
361278 366533 How are you, you stupid cat?<br />Where have you been?
367576 371413 I guess you two have met.<br />I'm Carter Burke.
371580 377460 I work for the company.<br />But don't let that fool you. I'm an OK guy.
377627 383133 I'm glad you're a little better. The weakness<br />and disorientation should pass soon.
383300 389097 It's just natural side effects<br />of such an unusually long hypersleep.
389264 393810 What do you mean?<br />How long was I out there?
396104 399149 Has no one discussed this with you yet?
399316 403820 But, I mean, I don't recognize this place.
404654 407157 No, I know.
407324 410827 It's just that this might be a shock.<br />It's longer...
410994 414164 How long? Please.
416249 418501 57 years.
419210 423423 - What?<br />- You were out there for 57 years.
424466 427677 You had drifted<br />right through the core systems,
427844 433683 and it's really just blind luck<br />that a deep-salvage team found you.
433850 438355 It's one in a thousand, really.<br />You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.
438521 442025 You could be floating out there forever.
442192 444235 Are you OK?
453620 455872 Are you OK?
464547 466549 God!
467258 469219 Nurse!
470512 473264 Someone get in here now.
473765 475392 Now!
475558 477727 - Hold.<br />- Please...
478269 480021 Hold her.
480730 483233 Kill me!
499541 504421 Bad dreams again?<br />Want something to help you sleep?
505088 507007 I've slept enough.
511344 513054 Come here.
519561 521563 It's all right.
526568 528445 It's over.
553887 559225 - Sorry I'm late.<br />- Is there any word about my daughter?
559392 563980 I think we should worry about the hearing<br />now, cos we don't have long.
564147 568151 I read your deposition, and it's great.<br />Stick to that and we'll be fine.
568318 570987 There'll be a lot of heavyweights there -
571154 576493 feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission,<br />Colonial Administration, insurance guys...
576659 579329 Do you have any news<br />about my daughter?
580872 585001 We did come up with some information.<br />Why don't we sit down?
585168 589172 I was hoping to wait<br />until after the inquest...
592175 598681 Amanda Ripley-McClaren -<br />married name, I guess - aged 66.
598848 602268 And that was at the time of her death.
602435 605313 Which was two years ago.
606856 609150 I'm real sorry.
619035 621121 Amy...
622831 627544 She was interred at Westlake Repository,<br />Little Chute, Wisconsin.
627710 630421 No children. I checked.
635009 639806 I promised her<br />that I'd be home for her birthday.
643143 645895 Her 11th birthday.
656906 659075 I don't understand this.
659242 662412 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
662579 665290 How many different ways<br />do you want me to tell the same story?
666249 670044 Look at it from our perspective, please.
670211 672255 Please.
674591 679929 You admit to destroying<br />an M-Class star-freighter,
680096 682432 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
682599 688605 42 million in adjusted dollars.<br />That's minus payload, of course.
688771 693109 The lifeboat's flight recorder<br />corroborates some of your account,
693276 698281 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
698448 701451 an unsurveyed planet at that time.
701618 706372 That it resumed its course and was<br />subsequently set for self-destruct, by you,
706539 710376 - for reasons unknown.<br />- Not for reasons unknown. I told you.
710543 716132 We landed there on company orders<br />to get this thing, which destroyed my crew.
716299 718635 And your expensive ship.
718801 722472 The analysis team,<br />which examined the lifeboat minutely,
722639 725308 found no evidence of this creature.
725475 730438 Good. That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn airlock.
731481 733566 Like I said.
735735 739822 Are there any species<br />like this hostile organism on LV-4267
739989 743534 It's a rock. No indigenous life.
744577 747997 Did IQs drop sharply while I was away?
748164 753336 I said it was not indigenous.<br />It was a derelict spacecraft, an alien ship.
753503 758007 It was not from there. Do you get it?<br />We homed in on its beacon.
758174 764472 And found something never recorded once<br />in over 300 surveyed worlds.
764639 770687 "A creature that gestates inside a living<br />human host." These are your words.
770853 775525 - "And has concentrated acid for blood."<br />- That's right.
775692 782198 I can see where this is going.<br />But I'm telling you that those things exist.
782365 785493 - Thank you. That will be all.<br />- Please!
785660 787829 Kane, the crew member...
787996 792375 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
792542 796212 - Thank you, that will be all.<br />- Goddammit, that's not all.
796379 799007 If one of those things gets down here,
799173 804721 you can kiss all of this bullshit goodbye!
811978 819736 It is the finding of this court of inquiry<br />that Warrant Officer E Ripley, NOC 14472,
819902 823197 has acted with questionable judgment,
823364 828870 and is unfit to hold an ICC license<br />as a commercial flight officer.
829037 834042 Said license is hereby<br />suspended indefinitely.
834208 840798 No criminal charges will be filed, and you<br />are released on your own recognizance
840965 844385 for a six-month period<br />of psychometric probation,
844552 850099 to include monthly review<br />by an ICC psychiatric technician.
852101 854020 These proceedings are closed.
865031 868284 That could have been better.<br />Look, I think...
868451 870578 Van Leuwen?
870745 874082 Why don't you just check out LV-4267
874248 877919 I don't have to.<br />There have been people there over 20 years,
878086 881130 and they never mentioned<br />hostile organisms.
881297 884175 - What people?<br />- Terraformers.
884342 889972 Planet engineers. They set up big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
890139 894394 Takes decades. It's what we call<br />a "shake'n'bake" colony.
894560 898106 How many colonists are there?
898815 902652 60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?
905321 907448 Families.
909784 911577 Jesus.
986861 992158 - I'll be down in Maintenance, OK?<br />- Al?
992325 997455 Remember you sent some wildcatters<br />out into the middle of nowhere last week?
997622 1001751 One of them's on the horn,<br />says he's onto something.
1001918 1005379 - Wants to know if his claim will be honored.<br />- Why wouldn't it be?
1005546 1009258 Because you sent them out there<br />on company orders maybe?
1009425 1014430 Christ! Some honch in a cushy office<br />on Earth says go look at a grid reference.
1014597 1017767 We look. They don't say why,<br />and I don't ask,
1017934 1020728 because it takes two weeks<br />to get an answer,
1020895 1023231 and the answer is always "Don't ask."
1023397 1025483 So what do I tell this guy?
1025650 1029487 As far as I'm concerned,<br />if he finds something, it is his.
1029654 1032114 - Lydecker?<br />- What?
1032281 1037328 You kids know you're not supposed<br />to be on this level. Get outta here.
1068067 1073322 - You go in places we can't fit.<br />- That's why I'm the best.
1073489 1078119 Knock it off. I catch you playing<br />in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.
1078286 1080496 - All the kids...<br />- I don't care.
1080663 1083124 Wait a minute. Annie, look at this.
1093843 1096846 Folks, we have scored big this time.
1103519 1105855 What is it, Dad?
1109400 1116198 I'm not sure. Let's try and get a closer look<br />at it through that crack down the side.
1116365 1120494 - Shouldn't we call in?<br />- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.
1124957 1130379 That's about as close as we can get.<br />Shall we take a look inside?
1145311 1148397 You kids stay inside.<br />We'll be right back.
1148564 1150566 OK. Bye.
1228519 1231647 Timmy, they've been gone a long time.
1231814 1234942 It'll be OK, Newt.<br />Dad knows what he's doing.
1236235 1243117 Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo<br />Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control!
1289079 1294502 Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman<br />of the Colonial Marine Corps...
1294668 1296879 We have to talk.
1297046 1300966 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
1307223 1309391 I don't believe this.
1309558 1314063 You throw me at the wolves,<br />and now you want me to go back out there?
1314230 1316816 Forget it. It's not my problem.
1316982 1320361 - Can I finish?<br />- There's no way.
1321862 1326534 You wouldn't be going in with the troops.<br />I guarantee your safety.
1326700 1329745 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough hombres.
1329912 1334375 They pack state-of-the-art firepower.<br />There's nothing they can't handle.
1334625 1339255 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- We're trained to deal with these situations.
1339421 1341340 Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
1342967 1345427 We don't know<br />what's going on out there.
1345594 1349598 It may just be a downed transmitter, okay?<br />But if it's not,
1349765 1353769 I would like you there as an adviser,<br />and that's all.
1356939 1360943 What's your interest in this?<br />Why are you going?
1361110 1365406 The corporation co-financed that colony<br />with Colonial Administration.
1365573 1368784 We're into a lot of terraforming,<br />building better worlds...
1368951 1374039 Yeah, I saw the commercial.<br />I've gotta get to work.
1375165 1378085 I heard you're working<br />in the cargo docks.
1378252 1379295 That's right.
1379461 1382131 - Running forklifts?<br />- So?
1382298 1385426 Nothing. It's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
1385593 1391056 And I know it's the only thing you<br />could get. There's nothing wrong with it.
1393142 1397062 What if I told you I could<br />get you reinstated as a flight officer?
1397229 1401066 The company's agreed<br />to pick up your contract.
1401233 1403277 If I go.
1404320 1408115 If you go. Come on.<br />That's a second chance, kiddo.
1408282 1413162 I think for you it would be best<br />to face this thing, get back on the horse...
1413329 1416332 Spare me. I've had<br />my psych evaluation this month.
1416498 1420502 I know. I read it. You wake up every night<br />soaking with sweat...
1420669 1422838 I said no, and I mean it.
1425799 1432014 Now please leave. I am not going back,<br />and I would be no good to you if I did.
1432473 1434099 OK.
1436518 1440022 Would you do me a favor?<br />Just think about it.
1443025 1445319 Thanks for the coffee.
1513303 1515347 Hello?
1518100 1521603 - You OK?<br />- Just tell me one thing.
1521770 1524940 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1525107 1530070 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1531196 1534116 That's the plan. You have my word on it.
1536785 1538620 All right, I'm in.
1548088 1550424 And you, you little shithead,
1551967 1554845 you're staying here.
1705454 1709374 They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.
1709541 1712419 Not enough to have to<br />wake up to your face, Drake.
1712586 1713629 What?
1713879 1714963 Is that a joke?
1715130 1717257 I wish it were.
1717424 1722262 Hey, Hicks. You look just like I feel.
1724431 1727768 OK, sweethearts, what are you waiting for?<br />Breakfast in bed?
1727935 1733106 Another glorious day in the Corps. A day in<br />the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm.
1733273 1738028 Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck<br />a fortune, every formation a parade.
1738195 1742199 - I love the Corps.<br />- This floor is freezing.
1742366 1746828 - Want me to fetch your slippers for you?<br />- Gee, would you, sir?
1746995 1751833 Look into my eye.<br />Fall in, people. Let's go.
1752000 1755837 - I hate this job.<br />- Crowe, Wierzbowski, on your feet.
1756004 1758715 You just had three weeks on your back.
1758882 1761969 I'm talkin' about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.
1762135 1764680 Yeah, Top, how about it?
1767557 1771687 First assembly's in 15, people. Shag it.
1772980 1775565 Who's Snow White?
1776441 1781363 She's some kind of consultant.<br />Apparently she saw an alien once.
1781530 1784533 Whoopee-fucking-do. I'm impressed.
1789037 1793166 Vasquez, have you<br />ever been mistaken for a man?
1793333 1795294 No. Have you?
1799214 1802509 You're just too bad.
1810892 1815856 - Top, what's the op?<br />- It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.
1816023 1821278 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1821445 1824156 Dumb-ass colonists.
1826575 1830245 - What's this crap supposed to be?<br />- Corn bread, I think.
1830412 1833248 It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1833415 1837586 I sure wouldn't mind gettin' some<br />more Arcturian poontang. Remember?
1837753 1843091 - Yeah, Frost, but your one was male.<br />- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.
1843258 1846053 - Bishop, do the thing with the knife.<br />- Oh, please.
1846219 1848305 Come on.
1848472 1852142 - All right!<br />- I don't wanna see that.
1854770 1860942 What are you doin"?<br />Quit messin" around, Drake. Bishop!
1861443 1863111 - Do it.<br />- Not me, man!
1863278 1865614 - Yeah, you.<br />- Quit messin' around.
1865781 1867866 Trust me.
1881254 1884800 - All right, knock it off.<br />- Thank you.
1888178 1892099 - Enjoy your meal.<br />- That wasn't funny.
1895477 1898814 - Lieutenant Gorman? Mr Burke?<br />- Thanks.
1899689 1905362 Looks like the new lieutenant's<br />too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1905529 1908657 The boy's got a corncob up his ass.
1910158 1913995 Thought you never missed.
1915789 1920293 You said nothing about<br />an android being on board. Why not?
1920460 1925715 It never occurred to me.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1925882 1930220 I prefer the term<br />“artificial person" myself.
1930387 1935016 - Is there a problem?<br />- I'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't...
1935183 1939813 Ripley's last trip out,<br />the artificial person malfunctioned.
1939980 1943525 There were problems,<br />and a few deaths were involved.
1943692 1948864 - I'm shocked. Was it an older model?<br />- The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A/2.
1949030 1952159 That explains it.<br />The A/2s always were a bit twitchy.
1952325 1955162 That can't happen<br />with our behavioural inhibitors.
1955328 1960667 It is impossible for me to harm,<br />or allow to be harmed, a human being.
1960834 1963462 Sure you don't want some?
1964045 1968300 Just stay away from me.<br />You got that?
1969885 1972679 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread either.
1986193 1990238 - Squad, atten-ho! Officer on deck.<br />- As you were.
1990405 1993158 Quickly. Settle down.
1993325 1995368 All right, listen up.
1996369 2001416 Morning, Marines. Sorry we didn't have time<br />to brief you before we left Gateway...
2001583 2004044 - Sir?<br />- What is it, Hicks?
2004586 2007214 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
2008798 2012385 - What's the question?<br />- Is this gonna be a stand-up fight,
2012552 2015222 or another bug hunt?
2015388 2018266 All we know is there's<br />no contact with the colony,
2018433 2021186 and that a xenomorph may be involved.
2021353 2023980 - A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
2024147 2026274 It's a bug hunt.
2026441 2030111 What exactly are we dealing with here?
2031071 2033573 I'll tell you what I know.
2033740 2036076 We set down on LV-426.
2036243 2038620 A crew member<br />was brought back on board
2038787 2042832 with something attached to his face,<br />some kind of parasite.
2042999 2048213 We tried to get it off, but couldn't.<br />Later it seemed to come off by itself and die.
2048380 2053134 Kane seemed fine.<br />We were all having dinner and...
2053301 2060225 It must have laid something in his throat,<br />some sort of embryo. He started...
2060392 2066481 I only need to know one thing:<br />where they are.
2066648 2069359 - Go, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2069526 2074155 Somebody said "alien". She thought<br />they said "illegal alien" and signed up.
2074322 2076950 - Fuck you.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2077117 2079953 Are you finished?
2084165 2087002 I hope you're right. I really do.
2089170 2095343 OK, thank you, Ripley. We have Ripley's<br />report on disk. I suggest you study it.
2095510 2100265 Because just one of those things wiped out<br />my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
2100432 2104853 If the colonists found that ship, there's<br />no telling how many have been exposed.
2105020 2107355 Do you understand?
2109941 2112902 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so look at it.
2113069 2115155 Any questions?
2116197 2120660 - What is it, Private?<br />- How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?
2120827 2123538 You secure that shit, Hudson.
2125206 2127208 All right.
2127375 2129669 Now listen.
2131630 2136343 I want this to go smooth,<br />and by the numbers.
2136509 2141097 I want DCS and tactical<br />database assimilation by 0830.
2141264 2146394 Ordnance loading, weapons strip and<br />dropship prep details will have seven hours.
2146561 2148563 Now move it, people.
2148730 2152942 You heard the man and you know the drill.<br />Assholes and elbows.
2153109 2155654 Hudson, come here.
2170960 2173755 I don't care if you are short.<br />Get it done.
2173922 2179260 - You'll get lip cancer smokin' those.<br />- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed.
2179427 2181971 - How many more, Spunkmeyer?<br />- Last one.
2182138 2184432 Take it away.
2200907 2203201 Clear behind.
2209207 2211876 Did you check number three?
2212043 2215797 Hi. I feel like a fifth wheel.<br />Is there anything I can do?
2215964 2219759 I don't know.<br />Is there anything you can do?
2221219 2224431 I can drive that loader.
2224597 2229436 - I have a Class 2 rating.<br />- Be my guest.
2274981 2277650 Where you want it?
2280612 2282322 Bay 12, please.
2338753 2342257 All right. You're a team,<br />and there's nothing to worry about.
2342423 2347387 We're gonna conquer,<br />and we're gonna kick some. Understood?
2347554 2351266 That's what we're gonna do,<br />sweethearts.
2351432 2354060 All right, people, on the ready line.
2354227 2355562 Are you lean?
2355728 2357063 Are you mean?
2357230 2359732 - What are you?<br />- Lean, mean marines!
2359899 2364279 Hudson! Get on the ready line.<br />Get some today!
2364445 2368616 Get on the ready line!<br />Move it out, goddammit!
2368783 2372161 Get hot! Get out, get out!
2372328 2375039 Move it out, move it out!
2380295 2384883 Absolutely badasses!<br />Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!
2385592 2387343 Move it.
2387510 2393141 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
2393308 2397604 I want combat seating.<br />You know your places.
2397770 2399981 Get those weapons stowed.
2400148 2403484 Come on, settle down, people.
2404944 2409157 - Lock 'em in, Hudson.<br />- Ready to get it on? You know it.
2409741 2411951 OK, Bishop, let's go.
2412452 2414120 Roger.
2415955 2418583 I'm ready, man.
2418750 2422253 Ready to get it on.
2426716 2430345 Cross-locking now.<br />Pre-launch auto cycle engaged.
2433681 2437727 Primary couplers released.<br />Hit the internals.
2450031 2452659 Confirm cross-lock<br />and drop stations secured.
2452825 2456162 Affirmative. All drop stations secured.
2459832 2461376 10 seconds.
2465004 2467924 Stand by to initiate release sequencer.
2468091 2469884 On my mark. Five...
2470051 2473721 We're on an express elevator to hell.<br />Going down.
2473888 2476891 ..two, one, mark.
2492907 2495159 Switch to DCS ranging.
2495326 2499831 - 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.<br />- We're in the pipe. Five by five.
2510550 2514220 - We're picking up some hull ionisation.<br />- Got it.
2514387 2517598 Rough air ahead. We're in for some chop.
2531362 2535783 How many drops is this for you,<br />Lieutenant?
2535950 2537952 38.
2539037 2542582 - Simulated.<br />- How many combat drops?
2543458 2546753 Two. Including this one.
2548296 2550131 - Shit.<br />- Oh, man.
2563352 2565480 Range 014.
2565646 2568149 Turning on final.
2572653 2576240 - I got a bad feeling about this drop.<br />- You always say that.
2576407 2579827 "I got a bad feeling about this drop."
2579994 2583915 When we get back without ya,<br />I'll call your folks.
2586167 2590338 All right. Let's see what we can see.
2590505 2593382 Everybody online. Lookin' good.
2595510 2597178 Drake, check your camera.
2597345 2599180 There seems to be a malfunction.
2599430 2603601 That's better. Pan it around a bit.<br />Good.
2603768 2605895 I'm ready. Check it out.
2606062 2608856 I am the ultimate badass.
2609023 2611859 State-of-the-badass-art.
2612026 2614529 You do not wanna fuck with me.
2615363 2617698 Check it out.
2618699 2621494 Ripley, don't worry.
2621661 2626582 Me and my squad of ultimate badasses<br />will protect you.
2626749 2628876 Check it out.
2629043 2632547 Independently targeting<br />particle-beam Phalanx.
2633714 2636342 Fry half a city with this puppy.
2636509 2641556 We got tactical smart missiles,<br />phased-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs,
2641722 2644725 we got sonic electronic ballbreakers!
2644892 2648229 We got nukes, we got knives,<br />sharp sticks...
2648396 2649438 Knock it off.
2649605 2651232 All right, gear up.
2651399 2656821 Two minutes, people.<br />Somebody wake up Hicks.
2670418 2674463 - Coming around for a 7009.<br />- Terminal guidance locked in.
2674630 2676757 Where's the damn beacon?
2676924 2679177 Oh, I see it.
2684599 2687852 - That's the atmosphere processor?<br />- That's it.
2688019 2691230 Remarkable piece of machinery.<br />Completely automated.
2691397 2695109 We manufacture those, by the way.
2704118 2708706 Ferro, take us in low<br />over the main colony complex.
2710499 2714629 Storm shutters are sealed.<br />There's no visible activity.
2714795 2716380 Hold at 40.
2716631 2717673 Roger.
2717840 2720593 Give me a slow circle of the complex.
2727308 2729727 Structure seems intact.
2730770 2735983 - They still have power.<br />- Ferro, set down on the landing grid.
2736150 2738819 Immediate dustoff on my clear,<br />then stay on station.
2753000 2755336 Down and clear.
2756837 2759757 Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.
2761717 2765012 I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
2767181 2769558 Let's go. Move it out.
2769725 2771769 Head 'em up.
2792248 2796002 First squad up online. Hicks, get yours<br />in a cordon. Watch the rear.
2796419 2799380 Vasquez, take point. Let's move.
2807096 2809223 Move up.
2812310 2814895 Hudson, run a bypass.
2819734 2822320 Second squad, move up.<br />Flanking positions.
2822486 2825114 Second squad online.
2853267 2855311 Are you set?
2858272 2860358 Go on.
2885758 2890805 Second team, move inside.<br />Hicks, take the upper level.
2917123 2921669 Sir, are you copying this?<br />Looks like hits from small-arms fire.
2921836 2927174 We got some explosives damage.<br />It's probably seismic survey charges.
2927341 2931929 Are you readin' this?<br />Keep it tight, people.
2944483 2949864 Hicks, Hudson,<br />use your motion trackers.
2966213 2968924 Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
2975181 2977224 Quarter and search by twos.
2989236 2992072 Dietrich, Frost, you're up.
3038786 3040621 It's right in there.
3053133 3054760 Now.
3057680 3062643 - Good one, Hudson.<br />- Sir, we have a negative situation here.
3062810 3063936 Moving on, sir.
3073404 3075656 Wait. Tell him to...
3076824 3078576 Back up.
3078742 3080828 Pan right.
3081829 3083664 There.
3084540 3087376 You seein' this all right?
3087543 3093090 Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged<br />one of Ripley's bad guys here.
3093257 3095009 Acid for blood.
3095175 3098679 If you like that, you're gonna love this.
3111942 3115446 - Quit screwin' around.<br />- Second squad, what's your status?
3115613 3118532 We've just finished our sweep.<br />Nobody's home.
3118699 3121368 Roger. Sir, this place is dead.
3121535 3125122 Whatever happened here,<br />I think we missed it.
3125289 3128626 The area's secured.<br />Let's see what their computer can tell us.
3128792 3131045 - It's not secured.<br />- The area is secured.
3131211 3134131 First team, head for Operations.
3134381 3136050 Hudson, try and get their CPU online.
3136216 3137343 Affirmative.
3137509 3140888 Hicks, meet me at the south lock.<br />We're coming in.
3141305 3146393 - He's comin' in. I feel safer already.<br />- Pendejo jerk-off.
3166789 3170459 Sir, we got the CPU online. No problem.
3170626 3173212 Good. Stand by in Operations.
3174588 3176256 OK, let's go.
3197152 3199655 Are you all right?
3217798 3221677 Sir, they sealed off this wing<br />at both ends.
3221844 3226140 Welded the doors, and blocked off<br />the stairs with heavy equipment.
3226306 3229309 But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.
3229476 3231437 - Any bodies?<br />- No, sir.
3231603 3235983 - Last stand.<br />- Must have been a hell of a fight.
3236150 3238527 Looks that way.
3240612 3247995 Drake, this way. We should be able<br />to cut through the medlab to Operations.
3297669 3299755 Lieutenant.
3320818 3323695 Are those the same ones?
3335249 3337501 Careful.
3346969 3350681 Looks like love at first sight to me.
3350848 3353392 He likes you.
3353559 3356854 Two are alive, the rest are dead.
3357771 3360732 Surgically removed<br />before embryo implantation.
3360899 3365571 Subject: Marachuk, John J.<br />Died during the procedure.
3365737 3367906 They killed him taking it off.
3372744 3375330 I think we got something here.
3379918 3382963 - Behind us.<br />- One of us?
3383130 3386300 Apone, where are your people?<br />Anybody in D-Block?
3386466 3390262 Negative. We're all in Operations.
3392431 3394516 Talk to me, Frosty.
3394683 3397185 Just keep movin', baby.
3414912 3417039 - It's moving.<br />- Which way?
3417205 3420792 It's coming straight for us. Straight up.
3458288 3460457 - Fuck.<br />- Hold up.
3484398 3486650 It's all right. Come on.
3486817 3491196 - Just grab her, Corporal.<br />- Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you.
3491863 3494908 It's all right. Come on out.
3495075 3496994 Come on. Easy...
3497160 3498412 I got her.
3498578 3500122 Damn!
3500288 3502833 - Don't let her go.<br />- She's under the grille.
3503000 3507421 - Frost, get your light up here.<br />- Where'd she go?
3509172 3511967 - Shine the light.<br />- Down here.
3513051 3515387 - Here.<br />- There she is.
3515554 3517431 Keep back. Don't scare her.
3517597 3521101 - Grab her. We're gonna lose her.<br />- Damn it.
3527232 3529317 Wait.
3554426 3557304 It's OK. It's all right.
3558847 3561141 Don't be afraid.
3562142 3564186 See?
3564352 3566271 Wait. No, you don't.
3566813 3570150 It's OK. You're gonna be all right now.
3572652 3576073 Easy, easy. It's gonna be OK.
3576239 3578909 You're gonna be OK.
3581036 3583955 Easy, easy.
3620450 3622994 - What's her name again?<br />- Rebecca.
3623161 3626832 Think, Rebecca. Concentrate.
3626998 3629793 Just start at the beginning.
3629960 3632420 Where are your parents?
3633046 3637676 - Look, you have to try...<br />- Give it a rest, why don't you?
3641179 3645058 - Total brain lock.<br />- Physically she's OK.
3645225 3648228 Borderline malnutrition,<br />but no permanent damage.
3648395 3651148 Come on. We're wasting our time.
3660365 3663952 Try this. It's hot chocolate.
3666246 3668290 There you go.
3671251 3673295 That good, huh?
3679593 3686600 I made a clean spot here. Now I've done it.<br />Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.
3694774 3699738 Hard to believe there's<br />a little girl under all this.
3699905 3702365 And a pretty one, too.
3707245 3709831 You don't talk much, do you?
3718006 3722135 - Smoking or non-smoking?<br />- Just tell me what you're scanning for.
3722302 3728350 PDTs. Personal data transmitters.<br />Every colonist had one surgically implanted.
3728516 3733855 If they're within 20 klicks<br />we'll read it out here. So far, zippo.
3734022 3739361 I don't know how you managed to stay alive.<br />But you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
3741571 3743281 Newt.
3745659 3750497 - What'd you say?<br />- My name's Newt.
3751414 3755543 Nobody calls me Rebecca<br />except my brother.
3758463 3760340 I like that.
3760507 3763510 I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.
3766638 3768807 And who is this?
3769557 3773103 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3774521 3778358 - What about your brother? What's his name?<br />- Timmy.
3778525 3783363 Is Timmy around here too,<br />maybe hiding like you were?
3786700 3788785 Any sisters?
3792205 3794499 Mom and dad?
3798128 3800380 Look at me. Where are they?
3800547 3803591 They're dead, all right? Can I go now?
3806678 3808847 I'm sorry.
3809639 3813393 Don't you think<br />you'd be safer here with us?
3815854 3819691 These people are here to protect you.<br />They're soldiers.
3819858 3822694 It won't make any difference.
3836708 3839002 Need anything else?
3840754 3843715 Hello, Bishop.<br />Do you need anything else?
3850055 3854768 - That's a nice pet you got there.<br />- Magnificent, isn't it?
3856478 3859939 Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen.<br />Found 'em.
3860106 3864652 - They alive?<br />- Unknown. But it looks like all of 'em.
3865528 3871409 Over at the processing station.<br />Sub-level 3, under the main cooling towers.
3872744 3877290 - Looks like a goddamn town meeting.<br />- Let's saddle up, Apone.
3877457 3879751 Aye, sir.
3879918 3884130 Let's go, people. They ain't payin' us<br />by the hour. Head 'em out.
3884297 3886424 Frost, you're drivin'.
3898228 3901147 Don't worry. It'll be OK.
3942564 3946526 I want a straight V deployment.<br />Second team on left flank.
3946693 3949487 Advance on axial 664.
3949654 3953658 Tracker online.<br />Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient.
3953825 3958705 Hudson, tracker online.<br />Left and right, little buddy.
3958872 3963334 40 meters in, bearing 221,<br />there should be a stairwell.
3963501 3965253 Check. Got it.
3966838 3969340 You want sub-level 3.
3970925 3975638 Let's go. Hudson, you got the point.<br />Hicks, watch our tails.
3975805 3978808 Nice and easy. Check those corners.
3984731 3989110 - Watch your spacing.<br />- You heard him. Don't bunch up. Stay loose.
3989277 3992906 Your transmission's<br />showing a lot of break-up.
3993072 3997827 - Probably interference from the structure.<br />- Use those lights.
3998870 4002916 Next one down.<br />Then proceed on a 216.
4003082 4005168 Roger. That's a 216.
4007795 4010757 I'm not making that out too well.<br />What is it?
4010924 4014135 You tell me, man. I only work here.
4028775 4030652 What is that?
4031903 4033863 I don't know.
4034906 4037200 Proceed inside.
4052757 4055760 Watch your fire<br />and check your targets.
4055927 4059264 Remember we're looking for civvies.
4068314 4069816 Easy.
4069983 4073945 Tighten it up.<br />We're getting a little thin.
4074112 4076364 Nice and easy.
4078700 4084455 - Looks like some sort of secreted resin.<br />- But secreted from what?
4084622 4087250 Nobody touch nothin'.
4087834 4090295 Busy little creatures, huh?
4091045 4094674 - Hot as hell in here.<br />- Yeah, but it's a dry heat.
4094841 4097093 Knock it off.
4104934 4108021 What do those pulse rifles fire?
4108187 4112525 10mm explosive-tip caseless.<br />Standard light-armor-piercing round. Why?
4112692 4118197 Look where your team is. They're right<br />under the primary heat exchangers.
4118364 4119991 So?
4120158 4125371 If they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
4125538 4128333 - She's absolutely right.<br />- So what?
4128875 4135048 This whole station is basically<br />a big fusion reactor. Right?
4135214 4139802 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion and "Adios, muchachos."
4139969 4142555 Great. Wonderful.
4143431 4145516 Shit.
4147810 4151230 Look... Apone?
4152565 4159781 We can't have any firing in there. I want<br />you to collect magazines from everybody.
4159947 4163910 - Is he fucking crazy?<br />- What do we use, harsh language?
4164077 4166913 Flame units only. I want rifles slung.
4167080 4169916 Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.
4171709 4176631 All right, sweethearts, you heard the man.<br />Come on, let's have 'em.
4176798 4179717 Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.
4182762 4184597 Damn.
4184764 4189811 You too. Give it up, Ski.<br />Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.
4189977 4192063 Right on, Vas.
4193648 4197276 Let's go, Marine.<br />Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.
4197443 4200196 - Thanks a lot, sarge.<br />- Hicks, cover our ass.
4200363 4202198 Head out, people.
4204617 4208162 I like to keep this handy<br />for close encounters.
4208329 4209831 I heard that.
4219173 4223469 - Any movement?<br />- Nothing.
4236649 4238776 Holy shit.
4251789 4254000 Newt, go sit up front.
4254834 4257170 Go on. Now.
4285490 4288576 Steady, people.<br />Let's finish our sweep.
4288743 4293539 We're still marines, and we got a job to do.<br />Keep it movin'.
4294540 4296793 Easy.
4327406 4330576 Top! Get over here. We got a live one.
4330743 4334914 - You're gonna be all right.<br />- Please kill me.
4335081 4337750 Just stay calm. We'll get you out of here.
4337917 4339752 It's gonna be all right.
4339919 4342129 - Oh, man.<br />- What is it, Dietrich?
4342296 4343798 Convulsion!
4344966 4347176 Dietrich, get back!
4356769 4358646 - Flame-thrower.<br />- Kill it!
4358813 4361440 Get back. Flame-thrower. Move!
4392305 4395558 - Movement.<br />- What's the position?
4396309 4400229 - I can't lock in.<br />- Talk to me.
4401147 4404358 Multiple signals. They're closing.
4406319 4409030 Go to infrared, people. Look sharp.
4409739 4414535 - What's happening? We can't see anything.<br />- Pull your team out.
4420333 4423419 I got readings in front and behind.
4423586 4427506 - Where? I don't see shit.<br />- He's right. There's nothing back here.
4427673 4433429 I'm tellin' ya.<br />There's somethin' moving, and it ain't us.
4433596 4439185 Tracker's off-scale.<br />They're all around us. Jesus.
4439352 4443064 Maybe they don't show up<br />on infrared at all.
4458829 4460873 Come on!
4467797 4472218 - Jesus Christ, what is going on?<br />- Wierzbowski and Crowe are down.
4472385 4475221 Dietrich, Crowe, sound off.
4488734 4491445 Let's rock!
4494240 4495741 Who's firing?
4498077 4500287 I ordered a hold fire.
4500454 4504625 They're coming out<br />of the goddamn walls!
4505918 4509755 Apone, I want you to lay down<br />a suppressing fire with...
4509922 4512591 Hold your fire, goddammit.
4512758 4518931 Apone, lay down a suppressing fire with<br />the incinerators and fall back by squads...
4519098 4522351 Say again? All after "incinerators".
4522518 4527606 I said lay down a suppressing fire<br />with the incinerators and fall back...
4533279 4535489 Sarge!
4535656 4537950 Talk to me. Apone?
4538117 4540161 - Talk to me, Apone!<br />- He's gone!
4542038 4546125 - Get them out of there, now!<br />- Shut up!
4546292 4549295 - Whoever's left, get the hell out...<br />- Just shut up!
4551505 4554300 Where's Apone?
4554467 4557553 The sarge is gone.<br />Let's get the fuck outta here!
4557720 4560181 Let's go, Marines.
4564143 4566604 - Hudson, look out.<br />- Get it!
4572318 4574779 - I told them to fall back.<br />- Fall back! Now!
4574945 4577782 - I told them to fall back.<br />- They're cut off.
4577948 4581118 Do something! Fuck!
4582036 4584914 - Keep moving, baby.<br />- Hold on, Newt.
4591629 4593964 What the hell are you doing?
4600137 4601555 Turn it round!
4604934 4606310 That's an order.
4610815 4614193 - Turn this thing around.<br />- Get off me, damn it.
4614360 4617071 You had your chance, Gorman.
4628707 4631252 - Come on.<br />- Come on, Vas.
4649895 4651897 Let's move it.
4653232 4654900 Come on, let's go.
4655067 4658404 It's blocked. We've got to go around.
4658571 4660239 Open the door.
4660406 4663242 Drake, we are leaving!
4663409 4665494 Get them, Vas.
4666704 4669081 Run for it.
4670249 4672376 Shit.
4676797 4680134 - Go.<br />- Drake, come on.
4686557 4688726 Drake, come on.
4697610 4700112 - Fire in the hold.<br />- He's gone.
4700279 4703699 - No! Drake's out there!<br />- Put it out.
4703866 4707119 - Drake's coming.<br />- He's gone.
4707286 4708954 He's not!
4711123 4714126 Forget him. He's gone.
4718130 4721258 Get on the goddamn door!
4723469 4725804 Eat this.
4729808 4731810 Go!
4794707 4797418 It's all right, we're clear.
4797584 4801130 You've blown the transaxle.<br />You're just grinding metal.
4801297 4803507 Come on, ease down.
4821567 4823694 You OK?
4826864 4829241 Get away from me!
4829408 4833078 - Lieutenant.<br />- What happened to Gorman?
4833245 4836290 I don't know. Maybe a concussion.
4836457 4838542 - But he's alive.<br />- No, he's dead!
4838709 4844423 - Wake up, pendejo! Then I'm gonna kill you!<br />- Back off. Right now.
4846759 4850137 Somebody get me a first-aid kit.
4850304 4857269 Look. The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead.<br />Their signs were low, but they ain't dead.
4857436 4861357 - Then we go back and get them.<br />- Fuck that. I ain't going back in there.
4861523 4864693 You can't help them.
4864860 4870908 You can't. Right now they're being<br />cocooned just like the others.
4873911 4878123 Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happenin'.
4878290 4881126 This can't be happenin', man.
4881460 4885089 All right.<br />We've got seven canisters of CN-20.
4885255 4888467 I say we nerve-gas<br />the whole fuckin' nest.
4888634 4891678 We don't know if it's gonna affect 'em.
4891845 4895808 Let's just bug out and call it even.<br />Why are we talking about this?
4895974 4900979 I say we take off<br />and nuke the entire site from orbit.
4902648 4904817 It's the only way to be sure.
4904983 4907528 - Fuckin' A.<br />- Hold on one second.
4907694 4911824 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4911990 4914159 They can bill me.
4914827 4920624 Look, this is an emotional moment<br />for all of us. I know that.
4920791 4923335 But let's not make snap judgments.
4923502 4926422 This is clearly an important species,
4926588 4931260 and I don't think we have the right<br />to arbitrarily exterminate them.
4931427 4933679 - Wrong.<br />- Yeah. Watch us.
4933846 4936223 Maybe you haven't kept up<br />on current events.
4936390 4939518 We just got our asses kicked.
4939685 4942438 I'm not blind to what's going on,
4942604 4946191 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action. I'm sorry.
4948360 4953282 I believe Corporal Hicks<br />has authority here.
4955033 4956702 Corporal Hicks is...?
4956869 4960038 This operation is under<br />military jurisdiction,
4960205 4963792 and Hicks is next<br />in chain of command, right?
4966712 4969089 That's right.
4969256 4973886 Look, this is<br />a multi-million-dollar installation.
4974052 4977764 He can't make that kind of decision.<br />He's just a grunt.
4977931 4980267 - No offense.<br />- None taken.
4980434 4982561 - Ferro, do you copy?<br />- Standing by.
4982728 4986899 - Prep for dustoff. We need immediate evac.<br />- On our way.
4987065 4991820 I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.<br />It's the only way to be sure.
4994406 4996074 Let's do it.
5003582 5006710 Pick it up, Hudson.
5012216 5015219 We'll set him down here.
5020766 5023936 Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.
5028440 5032319 - Hold on. There's something...<br />- Just get up here.
5032486 5034905 I'm in. Ramp closing.
5057886 5059972 Goddammit.
5061974 5063892 Where the f...?
5076822 5078907 Run.
5119573 5123368 That's great. That's just fuckin' great.
5123535 5128248 Now what the fuck do we do?<br />We're in some real pretty shit now!
5128415 5130584 Are you finished?
5133545 5135589 Are you all right?
5140510 5144890 I guess we're not<br />gonna be leaving now, right?
5145057 5149394 - I'm sorry.<br />- You don't have to be. It wasn't your fault.
5149561 5155859 That's it. Game over, man.<br />What the fuck are we gonna do now?
5156026 5160238 Maybe we could build a fire,<br />sing a couple of songs, huh?
5160405 5167037 We'd better get back. It'll be dark soon,<br />and they mostly come at night. Mostly.
5183261 5185597 That's everything, right?
5185764 5190477 All right, this is everything<br />we can salvage out of the APC wreckage.
5190644 5194189 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
5194356 5196149 That ain't so good.
5196316 5199277 We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.
5200320 5203490 Don't touch that. Dangerous, honey.
5203657 5208662 - Is that the only flame-thrower?<br />- It's only half-full but it's functional.
5208829 5211623 Got another one that's damaged.
5213750 5215419 But the good news...
5215585 5218463 We got four of these robot sentries,
5218630 5221550 with display and scanners intact.
5221717 5224803 They really kick ass.<br />They'll come in handy.
5224970 5228432 How long after we're declared overdue<br />can we expect a rescue?
5231685 5233437 17 days.
5234646 5241111 17 days? I don't wanna rain on your parade,<br />but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
5241695 5246074 Those things are gonna come in here<br />just like before...
5248076 5254291 This little girl survived longer than that<br />with no weapons and no training. Right?
5258003 5261757 - Why don't you put her in charge?<br />- You'd better deal with it.
5261923 5267679 Just deal with it, because we need you<br />and I'm sick of your bullshit.
5267846 5272184 I want you to get on a terminal<br />and call up a floor-plan file.
5272350 5278023 Construction blueprints, anything that<br />shows the layout. Are you listening?
5278190 5283028 I need to see air ducts,<br />electrical access tunnels, sub-basements,
5283195 5286865 every possible way into this complex.
5287365 5292871 - We don't have much time.<br />- OK. I'm on it.
5294247 5296708 Just relax.
5302172 5307010 I'll be in medlab.<br />Check on Gorman, continue my analysis.
5307177 5309638 Fine. You do that.
5316770 5320065 This service tunnel must be<br />how they move back and forth.
5320232 5327155 That's right. It leads from the processing<br />station right into the sub-level here.
5327322 5331827 Come down on that. OK, come over.<br />Go back...
5331993 5334579 OK, punch that in right there.
5339543 5341545 No. It's back here.
5343421 5346174 There's a pressure door at this end.
5346341 5350804 Couldn't we put a remote sentry unit<br />in the tunnel, then seal that door?
5350971 5354140 Yeah, but we gotta figure<br />on them getting into the complex.
5354307 5359604 That's right. So we repair the barricades<br />at these two intersections,
5359771 5365944 and weld plate steel over these ducts<br />here, here and here.
5366111 5369114 Then they can only come at us<br />from these two quarters.
5369281 5374661 Right. Then we put the other sentry units<br />here and here. Right?
5374828 5377497 - Right.<br />- Outstanding.
5377664 5380584 Now all we need is a deck of cards.
5381918 5386715 - OK, let's move like we got a purpose.<br />- Affirmative.
5402439 5405650 Do your thing, baby.<br />Let's get the hell outta here.
5405817 5409654 Hudson here. A and B sentries<br />are in place and keyed.
5409821 5411948 Arming now.
5412532 5415952 - Test it, Hudson.<br />- Fire in the hole!
5419497 5422167 OK, let's get the hell outta here.
5422334 5425503 We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.
5437807 5440060 For what it's worth.
5441561 5444689 I want you to put this on.
5445398 5447442 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
5447609 5451029 Then I can find you<br />anywhere in the complex on this.
5452864 5455283 It's just a precaution.
5455450 5460080 - Thanks.<br />- It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
5460246 5461873 OK, what's next?
5491528 5493571 Last stop.
5497742 5499411 Get in.
5499577 5501579 Scoot down.
5502956 5507752 That's good.<br />Now, you have a nap. You're very tired.
5507919 5511172 I don't want to sleep.<br />I have scary dreams.
5513633 5518763 I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.<br />Let's take a look.
5518930 5521099 Nothing bad in there.
5521266 5525437 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her.
5525603 5531234 She doesn't have bad dreams<br />because she's just a piece of plastic.
5531401 5534070 Right. I'm sorry.
5541494 5543788 There.
5543955 5548126 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters, no real ones.
5548293 5553381 - But there are.<br />- Yes, there are, aren't there?
5555592 5557802 Why do they tell little kids that?
5559971 5562474 Most of the time it's true.
5562640 5566311 Did one of those things grow inside her?
5566478 5570148 I don't know. That's the truth.
5571024 5574819 Isn't that how babies come?<br />People babies?
5574986 5578656 - They grow inside you.<br />- That's very different.
5578823 5583828 - Did you ever have a baby?<br />- Yes, I did. I had a little girl.
5583995 5585955 Where is she?
5587207 5591336 - She's gone.<br />- You mean dead.
5594005 5595548 Here.
5597008 5598802 Take this.
5599552 5601679 For luck.
5604808 5606851 How's that?
5609229 5614526 - Don't go. Please.<br />- I'm gonna be right in the next room.
5614692 5617195 And you see that camera up there?
5617362 5623535 I can see you through that camera<br />all the time to see if you're safe.
5626704 5632710 I'm not gonna leave you.<br />I mean that. That's a promise.
5632877 5635088 You promise?
5636214 5639676 - I cross my heart.<br />- And hope to die.
5641219 5644055 And hope to die.
5657277 5659487 Now go to sleep.
5659654 5661698 And don't dream.
5665910 5667996 Sneak.
5676754 5680800 The acid oxidises after the creature's death,<br />completely neutralizing.
5680967 5684262 That's very interesting,<br />but it doesn't get us anywhere.
5684429 5689267 I'm trying to figure out what we're<br />dealing with. Let's go through it again.
5689434 5695940 They grab the colonists and immobilise them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
5696107 5699777 Which means there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites.
5699944 5703948 - One for each colonist. Over 100 at least.<br />- That follows.
5704115 5708286 But each of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
5711039 5712540 So who's laying these eggs?
5713791 5717795 I'm not sure. It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
5718463 5722217 - Maybe it's like an ant hive.<br />- Bees. Bees have hives.
5722383 5726679 You know what I mean.<br />One female runs the whole show.
5726846 5729933 - The queen.<br />- Yeah, the mama.
5730099 5734145 - She's badass, man. I mean big.<br />- These things ain't ants.
5734312 5736314 I know that.
5736481 5740818 I want these specimens destroyed<br />when you're done. Is that clear?
5741986 5746658 Mr Burke wants them kept alive<br />for return to the company labs.
5749661 5751996 He was very specific about it.
5752288 5756376 Those two specimens are worth millions<br />to the bio-weapons division.
5756542 5760046 If you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
5760213 5762674 and we will be set up for life.
5764133 5766844 You're crazy, do you know that?
5767011 5771182 You really think you can get a dangerous<br />organism past ICC quarantine?
5771349 5773977 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
5774143 5777188 But they will know about it. From me.
5777355 5781526 Just like they'll know<br />you caused the deaths of 157 colonists.
5781693 5784362 - Wait a second...<br />- You sent them to that ship.
5784529 5790201 I just checked the colony log. Directive<br />dated 6/12/79, signed Burke, Carter J.
5790368 5793204 You sent them out there<br />and didn't even warn them.
5793371 5795748 Why didn't you warn them?
5795915 5799127 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />I didn't know.
5799294 5804048 If I made a major security situation out of it,<br />administration steps in,
5804215 5806551 and there's no exclusive rights<br />for anybody.
5806718 5812557 So I made a decision, and it was wrong.<br />It was a bad call.
5812724 5818438 Bad call? These people are dead!<br />Don't you have any idea what you've done?
5818604 5821316 I'm gonna make sure<br />they nail you to the wall.
5821482 5828031 You're not gonna sleaze your way<br />out of this one. Right to the wall.
5831034 5835913 I expected more from you.<br />I thought you'd be smarter than this.
5837081 5839667 I'm happy to disappoint you.
5853431 5857977 - What's goin' on?<br />- They're coming. In the tunnel.
5859937 5864942 Here we go. A and B gun<br />tracking and firing. Multiple targets.
5870782 5872700 Look at those ammo counters go.
5875286 5877455 B gun's down 50%.
5878623 5882126 Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.
5884796 5889801 60 rounds left on B.<br />40... 20... 10.
5889967 5892136 B gun's dry. 20 on A.
5893471 5895932 10... 5...
5899811 5904357 - That's it.<br />- Jesus. They're wall-to-wall in there.
5908486 5911114 They're at the pressure door.
5912490 5915827 - Listen to that.<br />- Bishop here.
5915993 5919580 - I have some bad news.<br />- That's a switch.
5921999 5924752 It's very pretty,<br />but what are we looking for?
5924919 5928339 That's it. Emergency venting.
5928506 5933136 That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.
5933302 5937014 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5937181 5942895 With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,<br />equal to about 40 megatons.
5943062 5946566 - We got problems.<br />- I don't fuckin' believe this.
5946732 5951529 - Vasquez, close the shutters.<br />- Why can't we shut it down from here?
5951696 5955950 I'm sorry. The crash caused too much<br />damage, and overload was inevitable.
5956117 5960913 Oh, man. And I was gettin' short.<br />Four more weeks and out.
5961080 5964542 - Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.<br />- Give us a break.
5964709 5967295 Four more weeks. Oh, man.
5967462 5970798 We've got to get<br />the other dropship from the Sulaco.
5970965 5973551 There must be some way<br />to bring it down on remote.
5973718 5977221 How? The transmitter<br />was on the APC. It's wasted.
5977388 5980975 I don't care how,<br />but we'd better think of something.
5981142 5983394 We're fucked! We're doomed!
5983561 5986314 Shut up!<br />What about the colony transmitters?
5986481 5989734 - The uplink tower at the other end.<br />- No, I checked.
5989901 5994238 The hard wiring between here and there<br />was damaged. We can't align the dish.
5994405 5996949 Somebody has to go out there.
5997116 6000411 Take a portable terminal<br />and patch in manually.
6000578 6004916 Sure! With those things runnin' around?<br />You can count me out.
6005082 6007919 - I guess we can count you out of everything.<br />- I'll go.
6008085 6010004 - Why don't you go?<br />- I'll go.
6010171 6012507 - What?<br />- I'll go.
6012673 6015843 I'm the only one qualified<br />to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
6016010 6019764 Right, Bishop should go. Good idea.
6020389 6026020 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.<br />I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
6037114 6038616 How long?
6038783 6042370 This conduit runs almost<br />to the uplink assembly. 180 meters.
6042537 6046249 Say 40 minutes to crawl down there,
6046415 6050461 an hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna,
6050628 6054340 30 minutes to prep the ship,<br />and about 50 minutes flight time.
6054507 6057009 It's gonna be close.
6060680 6063182 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.
6064976 6067520 Watch your fingers.
6084704 6086706 This is unbelievable.
6086872 6089375 20 meters and closing.
6089542 6091460 - 15.<br />- How many?
6092003 6094130 Can't tell. Lots.
6095631 6097925 D gun's down 50%.
6100970 6103806 C gun's right behind it.
6106017 6109228 It ain't stoppin' em.
6109520 6111522 150 rounds on D.
6111689 6114942 - Come on, baby.<br />- 100 rounds.
6117945 6119488 Come on!
6124076 6126746 D gun's down to 20.
6127663 6129707 10.
6130875 6132335 Damn it.
6134670 6136881 Wait. They're retreating.
6142178 6144889 The guns stopped them.
6147016 6148601 You're right.
6156108 6160363 - Next time they walk right up and knock.<br />- But they don't know that.
6160529 6165785 They're probably looking for other ways<br />to get in. That'll take 'em a while.
6165951 6169664 - Maybe we got 'em demoralised.<br />- Shut up.
6169830 6172166 I want you two walking perimeter.
6173793 6175920 Move.
6182635 6183886 Listen.
6184929 6191602 We're all in strung-out shape.<br />But stay frosty and alert.
6192603 6195940 We can't afford to let<br />one of those bastards in here.
6196107 6197817 All right.
6208828 6213624 How long's it been since you got any sleep?<br />24 hours?
6214625 6220631 I'm not gonna end up like those others.<br />You'll take care of it, won't you?
6222299 6226804 If it comes to that, I'll do us both.
6228472 6232977 Let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that. All right?
6235604 6240317 I wanna introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
6240484 6244196 This is an M41-A pulse rifle, 10mm,
6244363 6248826 with an over-and-under<br />30mm pump-action grenade launcher.
6248993 6251203 Feel the weight.
6257168 6259462 What do I do?
6264842 6267636 Pull it in tight here.
6268679 6272141 Lean into it. Now, it will kick.
6272850 6276479 Right. When the counter reads zero here...
6276645 6279356 - I press this up?<br />- That's right.
6281025 6284570 And get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
6284737 6287281 Now you're ready to rock'n'roll.
6287448 6290367 - What's this?<br />- The grenade launcher.
6290534 6296874 - I don't think you wanna mess with that.<br />- You started this. Show me everything.
6297041 6299335 I can handle myself.
6300544 6302421 I noticed.
6312723 6316393 - How do you feel?<br />- All right, I guess.
6316560 6319188 One hell of a hangover.
6319772 6324401 - Look, I just want...<br />- Forget it. Excuse me.
6380624 6383586 It's OK.
6456408 6458243 - Wake up.<br />- Wha...?
6458410 6461038 Be quiet. We're in trouble.
6482226 6484103 Move!
6515843 6517761 Help!
6521890 6526937 Say again, Bishop. You've got it into<br />auto refuel mode, and it's sequencing right?
6527104 6531275 - That's right.<br />- Good. Stay on it.
6531442 6535988 Get back to me when<br />you've activated the launch cycle.
6536155 6539450 - He's at the uplink tower.<br />- Terrific.
6545748 6547291 Help us!
6547458 6549460 Break the glass.
6549626 6551545 Break it.
6551712 6553797 I'll try.
6574818 6578405 - I'm scared.<br />- Me too.
6584036 6585913 Stay here.
6598509 6600677 It's the medlab.
6602012 6606183 - Meet me in the medlab. We got a fire.<br />- We're on our way.
6609061 6611355 They're coming.
6643679 6645722 Shoot it out!
6650853 6652729 Jesus!
6655232 6657568 Christ, kid, look out!
6678380 6681592 Over there. Ready?
6687431 6691393 All clear. Nailed the other one.<br />It's history, man.
6692811 6694605 Jesus.
6697274 6699610 It was Burke.
6701653 6704615 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch.
6704781 6708160 It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
6710621 6714666 He figured he could get<br />an alien back through quarantine
6714833 6717753 if one of us was impregnated...
6718754 6721006 whatever you call it,
6721173 6723926 and then frozen for the trip home.
6724676 6729181 Nobody would know<br />about the embryos we were carrying.
6729348 6731808 Me and Newt.
6731975 6733852 We'd all know.
6734019 6741193 He'd have to sabotage certain freezers<br />on the way home. Namely yours.
6742653 6746490 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
6746657 6749159 Fuck. He's dead.
6749701 6752079 You're dogmeat, pal.
6753121 6757960 This is so nuts.<br />Listen to what you're saying.
6758126 6761672 It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.
6764007 6768553 - It's pathetic.<br />- I don't know which species is worse.
6768720 6773100 You don't see them fucking each other over<br />for a goddamn percentage.
6773267 6777479 - All right, we waste him. No offense.<br />- No. He's gotta go back.
6779314 6783610 - They cut the power.<br />- How could they cut it? They're animals.
6783777 6786571 You two, check the corridors. Move!
6786738 6790701 Gorman, watch Burke. Newt, stay close.
6794037 6797207 - I'll go this side.<br />- You do that.
6821732 6823900 - Anything?<br />- Somethin'.
6825402 6829239 - It's inside the complex.<br />- You're just reading me.
6830741 6833035 It ain't you.
6834077 6837748 They're inside the perimeter.<br />They're in here.
6837914 6841251 Stay cool. Vasquez?
6847799 6849926 Hudson may be right.
6850427 6853096 - Get back, both of you.<br />- The signal's weird.
6854389 6859102 Must be interference or somethin'.<br />There's movement all over the place.
6859269 6861772 Get back to Operations.
6861938 6863940 It's game time.
6866568 6868695 Seal the door.
6868862 6871114 - Hurry.<br />- Come on.
6871281 6873950 Come on, get back. Work fast.
6878789 6881458 Cover your eyes. Don't look at the light.
6881625 6884294 Movement. Signal's clean.
6884461 6886463 Range 20 meters.
6886630 6890801 - They've found a way in that we missed.<br />- We didn't miss anything.
6890967 6892636 18.
6893637 6897641 - 17 meters.<br />- Something under the floor, not in the plans.
6897808 6899351 15 meters.
6899518 6902979 - Definitely inside the barricades.<br />- Let's go.
6904606 6907317 - 13 meters.<br />- That's right outside. Get back.
6907484 6911113 - This is a big fucking signal.<br />- How you doing, Vasquez?
6911279 6913448 Almost there.
6913990 6915659 That's it.
6916618 6918662 12 meters.
6918829 6920163 11...
6921248 6923417 - 10...<br />- Then they're right on us.
6923583 6926753 - Nine meters.<br />- Short controlled bursts.
6926920 6928296 Eight meters.
6931049 6932801 Seven.
6934010 6936847 - Six.<br />- Can't be. That's inside the room.
6937013 6942519 - It's readin' right. Look.<br />- Well, you're not reading it right.
6942686 6945522 Five meters, man. Four...
6945689 6947774 What the hell?
6950485 6953530 - Oh, my God...<br />- Give me the light.
6972048 6974509 Over there! Get 'em!
6976178 6978346 Come on.
6979389 6981808 Do something, Gorman.
6983393 6986438 Look out, there's more of 'em.
6986605 6989900 Get to Medical! Do it!
6990400 6992694 - Now!<br />- Look out, Hudson.
6998200 6999326 Now.
7005332 7008460 Open this door. Open it!
7011421 7013757 Fall back.
7018637 7020096 Die, motherfucker!
7025268 7029981 Motherfucker! Come and get it, baby!
7030148 7034236 I've got all day!<br />Come on, you bastards!
7034402 7038448 You too. You want some of this?<br />Fuck youl!
7040116 7041993 Fuck youl!
7054381 7056841 Come on, Hicks, go.
7057008 7058969 It's locked.
7076528 7078697 Got it. Let's go.
7078863 7080907 Go, go!
7082284 7083910 Move, Gorman.
7084077 7086496 Seal it.
7087831 7090625 Goddamn you, open this door.
7102637 7104222 - Get back.<br />- Hurry up.
7104389 7107017 - Gorman, get out of the way.<br />- This way.
7107183 7108852 What?
7109853 7115066 - Wait. Get behind me.<br />- Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
7117235 7119195 Come on, let's go.
7121031 7122365 Move.
7129205 7132876 - Which way to the landing field?<br />- This way.
7137255 7139382 Go right.
7142719 7144512 This way.
7153772 7156608 - Which way?<br />- Straight ahead and left.
7157025 7160236 Bishop, do you read me? Come in.
7160403 7162238 The ship is on its way.
7162405 7165367 ETA 16 minutes.
7165533 7168244 Good. Stand by there. We're on our way.
7179631 7183009 - Which way now?<br />- That way. No, wait. This way.
7183176 7184636 You sure?
7186221 7187764 Move!
7191768 7193895 It's just up here.
7194896 7198024 - We're almost there.<br />- Wait.
7227929 7229973 Go.
7246656 7250201 Up there. There's a shortcut<br />across the roof.
7261796 7265216 You always were an asshole, Gorman.
7286905 7290116 Hicks, get her. Hurry.
7295038 7296998 - Hold on.<br />- I'm slipping.
7297165 7299209 Don't let go.
7299375 7301377 - Hold on.<br />- Help!
7301544 7303254 Got ya.
7303421 7305131 I got ya.
7314057 7317060 We can find her with this.
7317393 7321564 Stay where you are. We're coming.
7339374 7341668 This way.
7342710 7344587 She's close.
7351177 7353429 Where are you? Can you hear me?
7355390 7359060 - I'm here.<br />- Where?
7364065 7366109 Are you OK?
7367110 7369946 - We need to cut it.<br />- Climb down, honey.
7370113 7372490 We've gotta cut through.
7382292 7384961 Don't move. Stay very still.
7387130 7389841 We're almost there. Hang in there.
7397640 7400351 - I know.<br />- Hurry. I mean it.
7414991 7417660 Newt, just stay still.
7422457 7425126 Almost there.
7442852 7444896 Let's go.
7445063 7448399 They don't kill you, they...
7448566 7451361 - She's alive!<br />- All right!
7451527 7455657 I believe you. She's alive.<br />We've gotta go. Now!
7488731 7490858 Get it off.
7501244 7503079 Here.
7507417 7509460 Go.
7511754 7514257 You can make it.
7538072 7542618 - Bishop, how much time?<br />- Plenty. 26 minutes.
7542785 7546122 - We're not leaving.<br />- We're not?
7631332 7634794 I don't wanna hear it.<br />She's alive. There's still time.
7634961 7637380 In 19 minutes,<br />this area's gonna be a vapor cloud.
7637547 7639966 - Don't let him leave.<br />- We ain't going anywhere.
7643886 7646472 - See you, Hicks.<br />- Dwayne.
7647682 7649350 It's Dwayne.
7651227 7653020 Ellen.
7653855 7656732 Don't be gone long, Ellen.
7664282 7671414 Attention. Emergency.<br />All personnel must evacuate immediately.
7671581 7677086 You have 15 minutes<br />to reach minimum safe distance.
7723341 7726052 Attention. Emergency.
7726219 7730431 All personnel must evacuate immediately.
7730598 7735978 You have 14 minutes<br />to reach minimum safe distance.
7974884 7978220 Grab on to me. Hold on.
8209618 8211286 Let's go.
8214748 8216667 Behind us.
