702995 706373 and was subsequently set for<br />self-destruct by you
706456 707916 for reasons unknown.
708000 710377 Not for reasons unknown. I told you.
710460 713672 We set down there on company orders<br />to get this thing,

718802 722472 The analysis team, which went over the<br />lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
722556 725684 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
725767 729813 Good! That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn air lock,
731481 733567 like I said.
735319 739906 <i>Are there any species<br />like this hostile organism on I V-426?</i>
739990 742492 No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

748165 750542 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.

828995 832416 <i>Said license is hereby<br />suspended indefinitely.</i>
834251 838588 Now, no criminal charges<br />will be filed against you at this time,

870787 874040 Why don't you just check out LV-426?
874124 877919 Because I don't have to. There have been<br />people there for over 20 years,
878003 880922 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.

1003420 1005505 Why wouldn't his claim be honored?

1513262 1515181 Hello.
1515264 1518017 Ripley.
1518101 1521646 - You okay?<br /><i>- Just tell me one thing, Burke.</i>
1521729 1525024 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1525108 1530029 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1530113 1534158 That's the plan. You have my word on it.
1536702 1537912 All right. I'm in.
1539372 1540206 I think that...
1548131 1550424 And you, you little shithead,
1550508 1553344 [Chuckles] you're staying here.
1579328 1581330 [Creaking]
1660076 1662453 [Beeping]
1669502 1671504 [Whirring]
1688229 1690231 Mmm.
1695569 1697530 [Coughing]
1699740 1702451 [Groans]
1705538 1709375 They ain't payin' us enough<br />for this, man.
1709458 1711544 Not enough to have to wake up<br />to your face, Drake.
1711627 1712461 What?
1713879 1715089 <i>Is that a joke?</i>
1715172 1717258 <i>Oh, I wish it were.</i>
1717341 1722263 Hey, Hicks. Man, you look<br />just like I feel. [Grunts]
1722346 1723222 [Coughing]
1723305 1726225 <i>All right, sweethearts.<br />What are you waiting for?</i>
1726308 1729437 Breakfast in bed?<br />Another glorious day in the corps.
1729520 1733024 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm...
1733107 1738112 every meal's a banquet, every paycheck a<br />fortune, every formation a parade.
1738195 1739864 - I love the corps!<br />- Christ!
1739947 1741824 Man, this floor is freezing!
1741907 1744410 What do you want me to do?<br />Fetch your slippers for ya?
1744493 1746078 Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1746162 1749415 Look into my eye. Fall in, people.
1749498 1751751 <i>Come on. Let's go.</i>
1751834 1753836 I hate this job.
1753919 1755421 <i>Crowe, Wierzbowski.<br />Come on. On your feet.</i>
1755504 1756589 <i>We got some slack coming, right?</i>
1756672 1759550 You had three weeks on your back, Frost.<br />What do you want?
1759633 1762011 <i>[Frost] I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.</i>
1762094 1764388 <i>[Dietrich] Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?</i>
1767516 1771687 <i>[Apone] All right. First assembly's<br />in 15, people. Shag it.</i>
1772938 1775566 Hey, <i>mira.</i> Who's Snow White?
1775649 1779111 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1779195 1781447 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1781530 1784575 Whoopee-fuckin'-do! Hey, I'm impressed.
1784658 1786702 <i>¡Que bonita!</i>
1789038 1793167 Hey, Vasquez.<br />Have you ever been mistaken for a man?
1793250 1795294 No. Have you?
1795377 1800216 Ha, ha!<br />Oh, Vasquez. You're just too bad.
1800925 1802635 Uhh!
1802843 1805012 <i>[Chattering]</i>
1811060 1813604 Hey, Top, what's the op?
1813687 1815815 It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.
1815898 1820611 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1820694 1822863 <i>[Spunkmeyer] Dumb-ass colonists.</i>
1825449 1829120 - What's this crap supposed to be?<br />- Vasquez.
1829203 1832289 - Corn bread, I think.<br />- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1832373 1835376 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting<br />some more of that Arcturian poontang.
1835459 1837086 <i>Remember that time?</i>
1837169 1840589 Yeah. Except the one<br />that you had was male.
1840673 1843300 Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.
1843384 1844969 Hey, Bishop, man.<br />Do the thing with the knife.
1845052 1845845 Oh, please.
1845928 1848347 - Oh, come on. Yeah.<br />- [All Goading]
1848430 1850391 All right! Yeah.
1850474 1854061 <i>- I don't want to see that, man.</i><br />- Come on, man. All right. All right.
1854145 1857148 Hey, what are you doing, man?<br />What are you doing?
1857231 1859358 - Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />- Hudson, shut up!
1859441 1862027 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- [Drake] Do it, Bishop!
1862111 1865698 - Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!<br />- Yeah, you! Don't move.
1865781 1868075 Trust me.
1869368 1871287 Aah!
1879795 1882756 <i>[Apone]<br />All right. Knock it off, knock it off.</i>
1882840 1884842 - Thank you.<br />- [Drake Chuckles]
1887303 1889305 - There you go, short shit.<br />- Enjoy your meal.
1889388 1892141 That wasn't funny, man.
1895686 1898814 - Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1898898 1904069 Looks like the new lieutenant's too good<br />to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1905487 1908657 Boy's definitely got a corncob<br />up his ass.
1909742 1912453 <i>[Burke]<br />Thought you never miss, Bishop.</i>
1915748 1918542 You never said anything about<br />an android being on board. Why not?
1918626 1922671 [Chuckles]<br />It never... never occurred to me.
1922755 1925841 It's just common practice.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1925925 1928385 I prefer the term<br />"artificial person" myself.
1928469 1930346 Right.
1930429 1933098 - Is there a problem?<br /><i>- [Burke] I'm sorry.</i>
1933182 1935100 I don't know why I didn't even...
1935184 1938604 Ripley's last trip out, the syn... the<br />artificial person malfunctioned.
1938687 1939688 Malfunctioned?
1939772 1943567 There were problems<br />and a few deaths were involved.
1943651 1946862 I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
1946946 1949615 The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1949698 1952284 That explains it then.<br />The A2s always were a bit twitchy.
1952368 1955079 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1955162 1956705 <i>It is impossible for me to harm,</i>
1956789 1959750 <i>or by omission of action,<br />allow to be harmed, a human being.</i>
1959833 1964046 - You sure you don't want some?<br /><i>- [Clattering]</i>
1964129 1966715 You just stay away from me,<br />Bishop. You got that straight?
1969510 1972763 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1976767 1979853 <i>[Chattering]</i>
1986193 1989280 [Apone] Squad, ten-hut!<br />Officer on deck!
1989363 1990322 As you were.
1990406 1993242 Quickly, quickly. Settle down.
1993325 1996328 All right. Listen up!
1996412 1997371 Morning, marines.
1997454 2001500 I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief<br />you people before we left Gateway...
2001583 2004044 <i>- [Hudson] Sir?</i><br />- What is it, Hicks?
2004128 2007214 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
2007298 2010217 What's the question?
2010301 2014096 Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,<br />or another bug hunt?
2014179 2018267 All we know is that there's still no<br />contact with the colony...
2018350 2021228 and that a xenomorph may be involved.
2021312 2024023 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
2024106 2026358 It's a bug hunt.
2026442 2031155 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
2031238 2033657 I'll tell you what I know.
2033741 2036160 We set down on LV-426.
2036243 2038537 <i>One of our crew members<br />was brought back on board</i>
2038620 2040247 <i>with something attached to his face,</i>
2040331 2042833 some kind of parasite.
2042916 2045252 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
2045336 2048255 <i>Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.</i>
2048339 2050883 Kane seemed fine.
2050966 2053093 We were all having dinner, and, um,
2053177 2057348 it must have laid something<br />inside his throat, some sort of embryo.
2057431 2061393 - He started... Um, he...<br /><i>- [Vasquez] Look, man.</i>
2061477 2066565 I only need to know one thing...<br />where they are.
2066648 2069401 - Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2069485 2071403 Right, right. Somebody said "alien."
2071487 2074365 She thought they said<br />"illegal alien" and signed up.
2074448 2076408 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2076492 2079119 Are you finished?
2084291 2087002 I hope you're right. I really do.
2089254 2092299 Yeah, okay, right. Thank you, Ripley.
2092383 2095344 We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br />I suggest you study it.
2095427 2097137 Because just one of those things
2097221 2100307 managed to wipe out my entire crew<br />in less than 24 hours.
2100391 2103143 <i>And if the colonists have found<br />that ship, then there's no telling...</i>
2103227 2104895 <i>how many of them have been exposed.</i>
2104978 2107398 <i>Do you understand?</i>
2109149 2112403 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so you better look at it.
2112486 2115155 <i>Any questions?</i>
2115239 2117616 What is it, Private?
2117699 2120702 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
2120786 2122538 You secure that shit, Hudson.
2125207 2127292 All right.
2127376 2130212 Now listen up.
2131588 2133715 I want this thing to go smooth...
2133799 2136343 and by the numbers.
2136427 2140889 I want D.C.S. and tactical database<br />assimilation by 0830.

2144059 2146437 - will have seven hours.<br />- Oh, come on.
2146520 2148689 Now, move it, people!
2148772 2149773 All right, sweethearts.
2149857 2151483 You heard the man,<br />and you know the drill.
2151567 2155737 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
2171003 2173005 I don't care if you are short, Hudson.<br />Get it done.
2173088 2175674 Hey, Sarge.<br />You'll get lip cancer smoking those.
2175757 2178927 Corporal, I want<br />this loading lock sealed. Now!
2179011 2181430 - How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?<br /><i>- Last one.</i>
2181513 2183557 Good. Take it away.

2209249 2211877 <i>Did you check number three?<br />Let me see that.</i>
2211960 2215881 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
2215964 2218342 I don't know.<br />Is there anything you can do?
2221303 2223555 Well, I can drive that loader.
2223639 2227309 <i>I have a Class 2 rating.</i>

2916706 2921711 [Apone] Sir, you copying this? Looks<br />like hits from small-arms fire.
2921794 2924881 <i>Uh, we got some explosives damage.</i>
2924964 2927217 It's probably seismic survey charges.
2927300 2931095 Are you reading this?<br />Keep it tight, people.

3081829 3087418 - There.<br />- You seeing this all right?
3087502 3093049 Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged<br />one of Ripley's bad guys here.

4124079 4127290 Ho, ho, ho. Yeah.<br />She's absolutely right.
4127374 4128333 So? So what?
4128416 4132629 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
4132712 4135090 Right?
4135173 4139845 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and adios, muchachos.

4340670 4343048 - What is it, Dietrich?<br /><i>- Convulsion!</i>
4343131 4345800 - [Screaming]<br />- Dietrich, get back!
4345884 4348261 - Get back!<br />- [Screams]
4355393 4358688 - No!<br /><i>- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!</i>

4393014 4397769 - What's the position?<br />- I can't lock in!
4397852 4400230 Talk to me, Hudson!
4400313 4403483 Multiple signals.
4403566 4405693 <i>They're closing.</i>
4405777 4409072 Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!
4409155 4412492 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
4412575 4414494 Pull your team out, Gorman.
4420333 4423086 I got signals.<br />I got readings in front and behind.
4423169 4425380 Where, man? I don't see shit.
4425463 4427966 <i>He's right. There's nothing back here.</i>
4428049 4430510 Look, I'm telling you. There's<br />something moving, and it ain't us!
4432554 4435557 - Oh, shit.<br />- [Hudson] Tracker's off scale, man.
4435640 4438935 They're all around us, man! Jesus!
4439018 4441938 Maybe they don't show up<br />on infrared at all.

4498077 4499495 I ordered to hold fire.
4499579 4502123 [Hudson]<br />They're coming out of the walls!
4502207 4504584 They're coming out of the goddamn walls!<br />Let's book!
4504667 4506878 - [Vasquez] On the right, man.<br />- Uh, Apone,
4506961 4509714 I want you to lay down a suppressing<br />fire with the incinerators...
4509797 4512550 Vasquez, Drake,<br />hold your fire, goddamn it!
4512634 4516554 [Gorman] Apone, are you copying me? I<br />want you to lay down suppressing fire...
4516638 4519182 with the incinerators<br />and fall back by squads to the A.P.C.
4519265 4521643 - Over.<br />- Say again, all after "incinerator."
4521726 4525521 I said I want you to lay down<br />a suppressing fire with the incinerators
4525605 4526439 and fall back...

4572235 4575738 - I told them to fall back.<br />- [Hicks] Fall back, goddamn it, now!

4803341 4805384 Ease down.

4828824 4832828 <i>- Lieutenant.</i><br />- What happened to Gorman?
4832912 4836165 I don't know. Maybe a concussion.
4836249 4838543 - But he's alive.<br />- He's dead!
4838626 4840711 Wake up, <i>pendejo,</i> and then<br />I'm gonna kill you!
4840795 4844006 Back off. Right now.
4845466 4848636 - Fuck!<br />- Somebody get me a first aid kit.
4848719 4851847 Hey. Hey, look.
4851931 4855226 The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
4855309 4857311 Their signs are real low,<br />but they ain't dead.
4857395 4859689 - Then we go back in there and get them.<br />- Fuck that!
4859772 4862149 <i>- We don't leave our people behind...</i><br />- I ain't going back in there.
4862233 4864694 You can't help them!
4864777 4869448 You can't. Right now they're being<br />cocooned just like the others.
4873744 4877039 Oh, dear Lord Jesus,<br />this ain't happenin', man.
4877123 4877999 Damn it.
4878082 4881127 This can't be happenin', man.<br />This isn't happenin'!
4881377 4884797 All right. We got<br />seven canisters of CN-20.
4884880 4888217 I say we roll them in there<br />and nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4888301 4889427 That's worth a try,
4889510 4891095 but we don't even know<br />if it's gonna affect them.
4891178 4893931 Let's just bug out<br />and call it even. Okay?
4894015 4895641 What are we talking about this for?
4895725 4899437 I say we take off<br />and nuke the entire site from orbit.
4902315 4904233 It's the only way to be sure.
4904317 4907570 - Fuckin' "A"!<br /><i>- Hold on. Hold on one second.</i>
4907653 4911824 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4911907 4914410 They can bill me.
4914493 4919540 Okay, look. This is an emotional moment<br />for all of us, okay?
4919624 4923044 I know that. But let's not<br />make snap judgments, please.
4923127 4926088 This is clearly... clearly an important<br />species we're dealing with,
4926172 4928924 and I don't think that<br />you or I or anybody has the right...
4929008 4932094 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4932178 4933721 Yeah. Watch us.
4933804 4936098 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4936182 4938851 but we just got our asses kicked, pal!
4938934 4942271 Look. I'm not blind to what's going on,
4942355 4944940 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action.
4945024 4947109 I'm sorry.
4948235 4951155 Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...
4951238 4953199 has authority here.
4954700 4956619 Corporal Hicks is...
4956702 4959080 <i>This operation<br />is under military jurisdiction,</i>
4959163 4961082 <i>and Hicks is next in chain of command.</i>
4961165 4963334 Am I right, Corporal?
4963417 4965378 Yeah.
4966545 4969090 Yeah, that's right.
4969173 4971217 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4971300 4973761 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4973844 4975763 He can't make that kind of decision.
4975846 4978432 He's just a grunt. Uh, no offense.
4978516 4982269 - None taken. Ferro, do you copy?<br />- Standing by.
4982353 4985022 Prep for dust off.<br />We're gonna need immediate evac.
4985106 4987024 <i>Roger. On our way.</i>
4987108 4991737 <i>I say we take off, nuke the site from<br />orbit. It's the only way to be sure.</i>
4994365 4996075 Let's do it.
4996325 5000079 <i>[Wind Whistling]</i>
5003207 5006752 Let's go.<br />Pick it up, Hudson. Pick it up, baby.
5011966 5014135 All right. Set him down here.
5020725 5022768 Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.
5027940 5029859 Hold on a second. There's something...
5029942 5032236 [Ferro] Just get up here.
5032319 5034822 I'm in. Ramp closing.
5054550 5056510 Spunkmeyer.
5057720 5061390 - Goddamn it.<br />- [Door Opens]
5061474 5063809 Well, where the fuck...
5063893 5066020 [Hisses]
5076572 5078491 Run!
5119365 5123160 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
5123244 5125704 Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
5125788 5128082 We're in some real pretty shit now, man!
5128165 5130543 Are you finished?
5133379 5135339 You all right?
5140553 5144765 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
5144849 5146475 I'm sorry, Newt.
5146559 5149436 You don't have to be sorry.<br />It wasn't your fault.
5149520 5150479 That's it, man.
5150563 5152940 Game over, man! Game over!
5153023 5155651 What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br />What are we gonna do?
5155734 5158863 Maybe we could build a fire.<br />Sing a couple of songs, huh?
5158946 5160155 Why don't we try that?
5160239 5162992 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
5163075 5166453 and they mostly come at night, mostly.
5183262 5187266 That's everything, right? All right.<br />This is absolutely everything...
5187349 5190352 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
5190436 5194023 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
5194106 5196233 That ain't so good.
5196317 5200029 We got, uh, 15 of these M-40 grenades.
5200112 5202072 <i>Don't touch that.</i>
5202156 5204617 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
5204700 5208746 <i>[Hicks] Yeah. It's only half full,<br />but it's functional.</i>
5208829 5212583 <i>Got another one, it's damaged...<br />I don't know about that one.</i>
5212666 5218464 But the good news...<br />we got four of these robot sentries,
5218547 5221592 with display and scanners intact.
5221675 5224845 They really kick ass.<br />I think they'll come in handy.
5224929 5229350 How long after we're declared overdue<br />can we expect a rescue?
5231393 5233520 Seventeen days.
5234521 5237066 Seventeen days?
5237149 5239026 Hey, man,<br />I don't wanna rain on your parade,
5239109 5241028 but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
5241111 5243572 <i>Those things are gonna come in<br />here like they did before.</i>
5243656 5244782 <i>They're gonna come in here...</i>
5244865 5245699 Hudson! Hudson!
5245783 5247952 <i>They're gonna come in here<br />and they're gonna get us!</i>
5248035 5250079 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
5250162 5253207 with no weapons and no training.
5253290 5255209 Right?
5257586 5260297 Why don't you put her in charge?
5260381 5263217 You'd better just start<br />dealing with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
5263300 5265469 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
5265552 5267471 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
5267554 5271141 Now, I want you to get on a terminal and<br />call up some kind of floor plan file.
5271225 5273936 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
5274019 5276397 Anything that shows the layout of this<br />place. Are you listening?
5276480 5279566 - Yeah.<br /><i>- I need to see air ducts.</i>
5279650 5283028 I need to see electrical access tunnels,<br />subbasements,
5283112 5286824 <i>every possible way into this complex.</i>
5286907 5291412 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
5291495 5293789 - Okay, I'm on it.<br /><i>- Hudson!</i>
5293872 5298544 - Just relax.<br />- [Exhales Sharply]
5301964 5307011 I'll be in medlab. I'll check on Gorman,<br />continue my analysis.
5307094 5310014 Fine. You do that.
5316228 5320065 So this service tunnel must be how<br />they're moving back and forth.
5320149 5322651 That's right.<br />It moves from the processing station...
5322735 5325070 right into the sublevel here.
5327114 5330451 Come down on that. Okay, come over.
5330534 5333746 Hold. Go back.<br />Okay, punch that in right there.
5339418 5341462 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
5343005 5345674 Well, there's<br />a pressure door at this end.
5345758 5348969 <i>Couldn't we put one of<br />the remote sentry units in the tunnel</i>
5349053 5350387 <i>and then seal that door?</i>
5350471 5353474 Yeah, that'll work, but we gotta<br />figure on them getting into the complex.
5353557 5354808 <i>That's right,</i>
5354892 5358604 <i>so we repair the barricades<br />at these two intersections.</i>
5358687 5359688 Right.
5359772 5361356 And weld plate steel<br />over these ducts...
5361440 5365819 here and here and here.
5365903 5368906 That way they can only come at us<br />from these two corridors.
5368989 5374703 All right. Then we put the other sentry<br />units here and here, right?
5374787 5377247 <i>- Right.</i><br />- Outstanding.
5377331 5379291 Now all we need is a deck of cards.
5381585 5383712 All right, people.<br />Let's move like we got a purpose.
5383796 5386548 <i>- [Hudson] Affirmative.</i><br />- Affirmative.
5398143 5401730 [Beeping]
5401814 5405484 <i>Do your thing, baby. Come on, Vasquez.<br />Let's get the hell outta here.</i>
5405567 5408445 Hudson here. "A" and "B" sentries<br />are in place and keyed.
5408529 5413408 Roger. Stand by.<br />Arming now. Test it, Hudson.
5413492 5415869 - Do it!<br />- Fire in the hole!
5419123 5421917 <i>Okay, great.<br />Let's get the hell outta here!</i>
5422000 5425462 We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.
5427506 5429341 <i>[Welder Crackling]</i>
5437641 5439560 For what it's worth.
5441520 5443814 Here. I want you to put this on.
5445190 5447442 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
5447526 5450988 Then I can find you<br />anywhere in the complex on this.
5451071 5452739 <i>[Beeping]</i>
5452823 5456910 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.

5499536 5503624 Scoot down. That's good.
5503707 5507753 Now, you lie here and have a nap.<br />You're very tired.
5507836 5511215 I don't want to. I have scary dreams.
5513592 5516678 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
5516762 5518680 Let's take a look.
5518764 5521099 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
5521183 5525479 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
5525562 5528065 Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...
5528148 5531193 because she's just a piece of plastic.
5531276 5534780 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
5541495 5543747 There.
5543830 5546708 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
5546792 5550128 no real ones... but there are.
5551463 5553423 Yes, there are, aren't there?
5555509 5557844 Why do they tell little kids that?
5559721 5561640 Most of the time it's true.
5561723 5565185 Did one of those things grow inside her?
5565269 5568063 I don't know, Newt.
5568146 5570107 That's the truth.
5570190 5574820 Isn't that how babies come?<br />I mean, people babies?
5574903 5578448 - They grow inside you.<br />- Oh, that's very different.
5578532 5580450 Did you ever have a baby?
5580534 5583870 Yes, I did. I had a little girl.
5583954 5588500 - Where is she?<br />- She's gone.
5590335 5592296 You mean dead.
5593880 5594840 Here.
5596216 5598051 Take this.

5628832 5632753 I mean that. That's a promise.
5632836 5635505 You promise?
5635589 5637883 I cross my heart.

5680842 5682427 Bishop, you know,<br />that's very interesting,
5682511 5684262 but it doesn't really<br />get us anywhere, does it?
5684346 5686890 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
5686973 5689059 Let's go through it again.
5689142 5691353 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there...
5691436 5695774 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
5695857 5699694 Which would mean that there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites, right?
5699778 5701947 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
5702030 5703949 Yes. That follows.
5704032 5708078 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
5710622 5712541 So who's laying these eggs?
5712624 5715710 I'm not sure.
5715794 5717754 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
5717838 5720048 Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.
5720132 5722175 Bees, man. Bees have hives.
5722259 5727431 You know what I mean. There's, like, one<br />female that runs the whole show.
5727514 5729891 - Yes, the queen.<br /><i>- Yeah, the mama.</i>
5729975 5732352 She's badass, man. I mean, big.
5732436 5734980 - These things ain't ants, <i>estúpido.</i><br />- I know that.
5735063 5739734 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
5739818 5742737 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
5742821 5744823 that they were to be kept alive<br />in stasis
5744906 5746658 for return to the company labs.
5748869 5750829 He was very specific about it.
5752289 5754416 Look. Those two specimens<br />are worth millions
5754499 5756251 to the bio-weapons division, right?
5756334 5759713 Now, if you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
5759796 5763008 and we will be set up for life.
5764050 5766636 You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?
5766720 5769723 Do you really think you can get<br />a dangerous organism like that
5769806 5770891 past I.C.C. quarantine?
5770974 5773852 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
5773935 5776980 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
5777063 5778231 Just like they'll know
5778315 5781318 that you were responsible<br />for the deaths of 157 colonists.
5781401 5783862 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
5783945 5786031 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
5786114 5789993 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
5790076 5793038 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
5793121 5795540 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
5795624 5798126 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />Do you ever think about that?
5798210 5801922 I didn't know. So now if I went and made<br />a major security situation out of it,
5802005 5803632 everybody steps in,<br />administration steps in,
5803715 5805383 and there's no exclusive rights<br />for anybody.
5805467 5809513 Nobody wins.<br />So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
5809596 5812349 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
5812432 5814100 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
5814184 5815810 These people are dead, Burke!
5815894 5818313 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
5818396 5821316 I'm gonna make sure that they nail you<br />right to the wall for this!
5821399 5823652 You're not gonna<br />sleaze your way out of this one.

5832953 5835914 I thought you'd be smarter than this.

6681634 6683260 <i>[Hicks] Now!</i>
6686764 6688682 - Hudson?<br /><i>- Yeah. All clear.</i>
6688766 6689683 Nailed the other one.
6689767 6691310 - It's history, man.<br />- [Coughing]
6692728 6694647 Jesus.
6695815 6699401 Burke...<br />[Coughs] It was Burke.
6701654 6704865 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
6704949 6707868 Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
6710830 6714875 He figured that he could get an alien<br />back through quarantine...
6714959 6717670 if one of us was impregnated...
6718963 6721173 <i>whatever you call it...</i>
6721257 6723843 <i>and then frozen for the trip home.</i>
6723926 6727972 Nobody would know<br />about the embryos we were carrying...
6728055 6730099 me and Newt.
6731934 6733894 Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
6733978 6736230 Yes. The only way he could do it...
6736313 6740067 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
6740151 6742736 Namely yours.
6742820 6746699 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
6746782 6752163 Fuck! He's dead. You're dog meat, pal.
6753164 6755082 This is so nuts.
6755166 6757793 I mean, listen...<br />Listen to what you're saying.
6757877 6760546 It's paranoid delusion.
6760629 6764967 <i>It's really sad. It's pathetic.</i>
6765050 6768846 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
6768929 6772224 You don't see them fucking each other<br />over for a goddamn percentage.
6772308 6775436 All right. We waste him. No offense.
6775519 6777188 No! He's gotta go back...
6779356 6781984 - They cut the power.<br />- What do you mean, <i>they</i> cut the power?
6782067 6783652 How could they cut the power, man?<br />They're animals.
6783736 6786322 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!

6827196 6829198 You're just reading me.
6830157 6832076 No, no, it ain't you.
