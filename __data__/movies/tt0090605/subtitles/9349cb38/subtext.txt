299710 304260 <i>Bio readouts are all in the<br />green. Looks like she's alive.</i>
306760 309760 Well, there goes our salvage, guys.
336210 339396 - How are we today?<br />- Terrible.
339420 342356 Well, better than yesterday, at least.
342380 345196 - Where am I?<br />- You're safe.
345220 347696 You're at gateway station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
347720 351196 You were pretty groggy at<br />first, but now you're okay.
351220 353720 Looks like you've got a visitor.
355600 357940 Jonesy. Come here.
359100 361296 Hey, come here.
361320 363756 How are you, you stupid cat?
363780 367756 How are you? Where have you been?
367780 371676 Guess you two have met?<br />I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
371700 373426 I work for the company,
373450 376250 but don't let that fool<br />you. I'm really an okay guy.
377540 379516 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
379540 383186 They tell me that all the weakness<br />and disorientation should pass soon.
383210 387646 That's just natural side effects of<br />such an unusually long hypersleep,
387670 389156 or something like that.
389180 391406 What do you mean?
391430 393866 How long was I out there?
393890 396036 <i>Inhalation therapy, report to</i>
396060 398366 has no one discussed this with you yet?
398390 404546 No. But, I mean… I don't…<br />recognize this place.
404570 406626 No, I know
406650 410466 okay. It's just that, this<br />might be a shock to you.
410490 413136 - It's long—<br />- How long?
413160 415160 Please.
416160 420186 - 57 years.<br />- What?
420210 424526 That's the thing. You<br />were out there for 57 years.
424550 427736 What happened was you had<br />drifted right through the core systems.
427760 430656 And it's really just blind luck
430680 433946 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
433970 436326 It's one in a thousand, really.
436350 438866 I think you're damn<br />lucky to be alive, kiddo.
438890 441126 You could be floating out there forever.
441150 444416 <i>You— you okay?</i>
450780 453596 Uuh!
453620 455870 <i>You okay?</i>
460410 465210 H-H! God!
466630 470276 - Nurse! Please!<br />- God!
470300 473316 Someone get in here now!
473340 475446 Now!
475470 477736 - Hold!<br />- Please.
477760 480036 Hold on!
480060 482060 Kill me!
489740 493660 No!
499450 502636 Bad dreams again? You want<br />something to help you sleep?
502660 504976 No.
505000 507000 I've slept enough.
508960 511236 Jonesy.
511260 513220 Come here.
513470 515430 Shh.
519720 521730 It's all right.
522730 526586 It's all right now.
526610 528650 It's over.
547880 553896 <i>Dr. Hirsch, 334. Dr. Hirsch, 334.</i>
553920 556446 Hi. Sorry I'm late. I've been<br />running behind all morning.
556470 559326 <i>Is there any word about my daughter?</i>
559350 562826 … I really think we should<br />worry about the hearing now.
562850 564246 'Cause we don't have a lot of time, okay?
564270 566286 I read your deposition, and it's great.
566310 569416 If you just stick to that, I think we'll<br />be fine. The thing to remember is,
569440 571456 there're gonna be a lot<br />of heavyweights in there.
571480 573546 You've got feds and interstellar<br />commerce commission,
573570 576716 colonial administration,<br />insurance company guys
576740 579320 do you have any news<br />about my daughter?
580830 585056 Well, we did come up with some<br />information. Why don't we sit down?
585080 588226 I was hoping to wait<br />until after the inquest.
592250 596316 "Amanda Ripley-McClaren"<br />— married name, I guess
596340 598566 "age 66."
598590 600930 And that was at the time of her death,
602640 605310 <i>which was two years ago.</i>
606560 608650 <i>I'm real sorry.</i>
617780 619700 Amy.
622910 624676 <i>She was cremated and interred</i>
624700 627596 <i>at west lake repository,<br />little chute, Wisconsin.</i>
627620 631000 No children. I checked.
635170 640340 I promised her… that I'd<br />be home for her birthday.
643260 646220 Her 11th birthday.
651230 653416 <i>I'd just like to go</i>
653440 655706 <i>back to this point about<br />the override destruct order.</i>
655730 659376 <i>- Is it in the file?<br />- I don't understand this.</i>
659400 661756 We have been here for<br />three and a half hours.
661780 664460 Now, how many different ways do<br />you want me to tell the same story?
665540 670186 Look at it from our perspective, please.
670210 672210 Please?
674630 677146 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
677170 680066 and thereby destroying,<br />an m-class star freighter,
680090 682616 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
682640 685906 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
685930 688746 That's minus payload, of course.
688770 690576 The lifeboat's flight recorder
690600 693206 corroborates some<br />elements of your account,
693230 698336 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the nostromo set down on lv-426,
698360 702966 an unsurveyed planet at that<br />time, that it resumed its course,
702990 706426 and was subsequently<br />set for self-destruct by you
706450 707966 for reasons unknown.
707990 710436 Not for reasons unknown. I told you.
710460 713726 We set down there on<br />company orders to get this thing,
713750 718776 which destroyed my crew…<br />and your expensive ship.
718800 722526 The analysis team, which went over<br />the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
722550 725736 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
725760 729810 Good! That's because I blew<br />it out of the goddamn air lock,
731480 733560 like I said.
735310 739966 <i>Are there any species like<br />this hostile organism on lv-426?</i>
739990 742490 No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.
744490 748136 Did I.Q.'S just drop<br />sharply while I was away?
748160 750596 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
750620 753436 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
753460 758106 <i>It was not from there. Do you<br />get it? We homed in on its beacon.</i>
758130 760986 And found something<br />never recorded once
761010 764566 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
764590 768536 "A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host."
768560 769446 Yes.
769470 773456 These are your words. "And<br />has concentrated acid for blood."
773480 775786 <i>That's right.</i>
775810 779796 Look. I can see where this is going,
779820 782336 but I'm telling you that those things exist.
782360 784126 Thank you, officer Ripley. That will be all.
784150 785586 Please. You're not listening to me.
785610 788176 <i>Kane, the crew member</i>
788200 792016 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
792040 794136 <i>- Thousands.<br />- Thank you. That will be all.</i>
794160 796266 Goddamn it, that's not all!
796290 800066 <i>Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!</i>
800090 802686 Then all of this— this bullshit<br />that you think is so important
802710 806510 you can just kiss all of that good-bye!
812270 814656 It is the finding of this<br />court of inquiry that
814680 819956 warrant officer e. Ripley, <i>noc 14472,</i>
819980 822796 <i>has acted with questionable judgment,</i>
822820 827240 and is unfit to hold an I.C.C.<br />License as a commercial flight officer.
828990 832410 <i>Said license is hereby<br />suspended indefinitely.</i>
834250 838646 Now, no criminal charges will<br />be filed against you at this time,
838670 840976 and you are released on<br />your own recognizance,
841000 843856 <i>for a six-month period of<br />psychometric probation,</i>
843880 849390 to include monthly review by<br />an I.C.C. Psychiatric technician.
851180 854060 These proceedings are closed.
865030 867256 That could have been better.
867280 870756 - Look, I think the— Ripley?<br />- Van leuwen.
870780 874096 Why don't you just check out lv-426?
874120 877976 Because I don't have to. There have<br />been people there for over 20 years,
878000 880976 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
881000 882726 What do you mean? What people?
882750 885936 Terraformers. Planet engineers.
885960 889776 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
889800 892116 Takes decades.
892140 894446 It's what we call a<br />"shake 'n bake" colony.
894470 898156 How many are there?<br />How many colonists?
898180 902690 I don't know— 60, maybe<br />70 families. Do you mind?
905360 907360 Families.
909610 911610 Jesus.
986860 989376 - I'll be down in maintenance, okay?<br />- Al!
989400 991416 - What?<br />- Hey, al.
991440 993676 - What?<br />- Remember you sent some wildcatters
993700 996596 out to the middle of nowhere<br />last week, out past the ilium range?
996620 997506 Yeah, what?
997530 1000556 One of them's on the horn,<br />a mom-and-pop survey team.
1000580 1003396 He says he's onto something. He<br />wants to know if his claim will be honored.
1003420 1005556 Why wouldn't his claim be honored?
1005580 1007646 Well, because you sent them to<br />that particular middle-of-nowhere
1007670 1008726 on company orders, maybe.
1008750 1009686 I don't know.
1009710 1012316 Christ! Some honch in<br />a cushy office on earth
1012340 1014526 says, "go look at a grid reference."
1014550 1017866 We look. They don't<br />say why, and I don't ask.
1017890 1020866 I don't ask, because it takes two<br />weeks to get an answer out here,
1020890 1022036 and the answer is always
1022060 1024036 "don't ask."
1024060 1026246 So what do I tell this guy?
1026270 1029586 Tell him as far as I'm concerned,<br />if he finds something, it is his.
1029610 1031530 - Lydecker?<br />- What?
1032530 1034256 You kids know you're not<br />supposed to be on this level!
1034280 1036610 Go on! Get outta here!
1068060 1071376 Do too. You go in places we can't fit.
1071400 1073466 So? That's why I'm the best.
1073490 1074416 Knock it off!
1074440 1077136 I catch either of you<br />playing in the air ducts again,
1077160 1078216 I'll tan your hides.
1078240 1080556 Mom, all the kids play
1080580 1083160 wait a minute. Annie, come<br />and have a look at this, will ya?
1093880 1096840 Folks, we have scored big this time.
1102930 1105810 What is it, dad?
1109400 1112456 I'm not sure.
1112480 1114626 Let's see if we can't get<br />a closer look at this thing,
1114650 1116336 maybe through that<br />crack there on the side.
1116360 1117676 Shouldn't we call in?
1117700 1120490 Let's wait till we know<br />what to call it in as.
1124040 1126636 <i>That's about as close as we can get.</i>
1126660 1129750 Should we take a look inside?
1145350 1148666 You two stay inside. I<br />mean it. We'll be right back.
1148690 1150730 - Okay.<br />- Bye.
1228560 1231746 Timmy, they've been gone a long time.
1231770 1234190 It'll be okay, newt. Dad<br />knows what he's doing.
1235230 1240126 Mayday, mayday! This is<br />Alpha kilo two four niner calling!
1240150 1243216 <i>This is Alpha kilo two four niner!</i>
1243240 1245530 Alpha kilo two four niner calling!
1289200 1291466 Hiya, Ripley. This is lieutenant gorman
1291490 1294686 of the colonial marine corps
1294710 1297016 Ripley, we have to talk.
1297040 1300750 We've lost contact with<br />the colony on lv-426.
1307220 1309526 I don't believe this.
1309550 1314156 You guys throw me at the wolves, and<br />now you want me to go back out there?
1314180 1316866 Forget it. It's not my problem.
1316890 1320480 - Can I finish?<br />- No. There's no way.
1321900 1324046 Ripley, you wouldn't be<br />going in with the troops.
1324070 1326466 I can guarantee your safety.
1326490 1329046 These colonial marines<br />are very tough hombres.
1329070 1332006 They're packing<br />state-of-the-art firepower.
1332030 1333390 There's nothing they can't handle.
1334580 1336976 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- That's true.
1337000 1339226 We've been trained to<br />deal with situations like this.
1339250 1342976 Then you don't need<br />me. I'm not a soldier.
1343000 1345646 <i>Yeah, but we don't know<br />exactly what's going on out there.</i>
1345670 1348356 <i>It may just be a downed<br />transmitter, okay?</i>
1348380 1352906 But if it's not, I would like<br />you there as an adviser,
1352930 1354970 and that's all.
1356980 1359876 What's your interest in all<br />this? Why are you going?
1359900 1362996 Corporation cofinanced that colony,
1363020 1365586 along with colonial administration.
1365610 1368506 We're getting into a lot of terraforming<br />now. "Building better worlds"
1368530 1371096 yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
1371120 1374096 Look, I don't have time for<br />this. I've got to get to work.
1374120 1377306 Right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
1377330 1379436 That's right.
1379460 1381266 Running loaders and<br />forklifts, that sort of thing?
1381290 1382186 Yeah. So?
1382210 1385436 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
1385460 1388026 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
1388050 1389880 There's nothing wrong with it.
1393140 1395656 What would you say if I told<br />you I could get you reinstated
1395680 1397746 <i>as a flight officer?</i>
1397770 1401416 <i>The company's already<br />agreed to pick up your contract.</i>
1401440 1402286 If I go.
1402310 1405336 Yeah, if you go.
1405360 1407586 Come on. That's a<br />second chance, kiddo.
1407610 1409126 I think, personally, for you,
1409150 1410586 it would be the best thing in the world
1410610 1413386 <i>to get out there and face this<br />thing, get back on the horse.</i>
1413410 1416426 Spare me, Burke. I've had<br />my psych evaluation this month.
1416450 1417766 Yeah, I know. I've read it.
1417790 1420596 You wake up every night. Your<br />sheets are soaking with sweat
1420620 1422880 I said no, and I mean it!
1425670 1428606 Now, please leave. I am not going back.
1428630 1432026 And I am— I would not<br />be any good to you if I did.
1432050 1435140 Okay. Shh.
1436560 1440060 Would you do me a<br />favor? Just think about it.
1443150 1445190 Thanks for the coffee.
1513260 1515236 Hello.
1515260 1518076 Ripley.
1518100 1521696 - You okay?<br />- Just tell me one thing, Burke.
1521720 1525076 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1525100 1530086 Not to study, not to bring<br />back, but to wipe them out.
1530110 1534150 That's the plan. You have my word on it.
1536700 1537910 All right. I'm in.
1539370 1540370 I think that...
1548130 1553340 And you, you little<br />shithead, you're staying here.
1705530 1709426 They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.
1709450 1711596 Not enough to have to<br />wake up to your face, Drake.
1711620 1712620 What?
1713870 1715146 <i>Is that a joke?</i>
1715170 1717316 <i>I wish it were.</i>
1717340 1722260 Hey, Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel.
1723300 1726276 <i>All right, sweethearts.<br />What are you waiting for?</i>
1726300 1729496 Breakfast in bed? Another<br />glorious day in the corps.
1729520 1733076 A day in the marine corps<br />is like a day on the farm
1733100 1738166 every meal's a banquet, every paycheck<br />a fortune, every formation a parade.
1738190 1739916 - I love the corps!<br />- Christ!
1739940 1741876 Man, this floor is freezing!
1741900 1744466 What do you want me to<br />do? Fetch your slippers for ya?
1744490 1746136 Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1746160 1749466 Look into my eye. Fall in, people.
1749490 1751806 <i>Come on. Let's go.</i>
1751830 1753886 I hate this job.
1753910 1755476 <i>Crowe, wierzbowski.<br />Come on. On your feet.</i>
1755500 1756646 <i>We got some slack coming, right?</i>
1756670 1759606 You had three weeks on your<br />back, frost. What do you want?
1759630 1762066 <i>I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.</i>
1762090 1764380 <i>Yeah, top. How 'bout it?</i>
1767510 1771680 <i>All right. First assembly's<br />in 15, people. Shag it.</i>
1772930 1775616 Hey, Mira. Who's snow white?
1775640 1779166 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1779190 1781506 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1781530 1784626 Whoopee-fuckin'-do!<br />Hey, I'm impressed.
1784650 1786700 <i>¡Que bonita!</i>
1789030 1793226 Hey, vasquez. Have you<br />ever been mistaken for a man?
1793250 1795346 No. Have you?
1795370 1800210 Ha, ha! Vasquez. You're just too bad.
1811060 1813656 Hey, top, what's the op?
1813680 1815866 It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.
1815890 1820666 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1820690 1822860 <i>Dumb-ass colonists.</i>
1825440 1829176 - What's this crap supposed to be?<br />- Vasquez.
1829200 1832346 - Corn bread, I think.<br />- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1832370 1835426 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting<br />some more of that arcturian poontang.
1835450 1837136 <i>Remember that time?</i>
1837160 1840646 Yeah. Except the one<br />that you had was male.
1840670 1843356 Doesn't matter when it's arcturian.
1843380 1845026 Hey, bishop, man. Do<br />the thing with the knife.
1845050 1845896 Please.
1845920 1848406 Come on. Yeah.
1848430 1850446 All right! Yeah.
1850470 1854116 <i>- I don't want to see that, man.<br />- Come on, man. All right. All right.</i>
1854140 1857206 Hey, what are you doing,<br />man? What are you doing?
1857230 1859416 - Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />- Hudson, shut up!
1859440 1862086 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- Do it, bishop!
1862110 1865756 - Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!<br />- Yeah, you! Don't move.
1865780 1868070 Trust me.
1879790 1882816 <i>All right. Knock it off, knock it off.</i>
1882840 1884840 Thank you.
1887300 1889356 - There you go, short shit.<br />- Enjoy your meal.
1889380 1892140 That wasn't funny, man.
1895680 1898866 - Lieutenant gorman? Mr. Burke?<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1898890 1904060 Looks like the new lieutenant's too<br />good to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1905480 1908650 Boy's definitely got a corncob up his ass.
1909740 1912450 <i>Thought you never miss, bishop.</i>
1915740 1918596 You never said anything about an<br />Android being on board. Why not?
1918620 1922726 It never— never occurred to me.
1922750 1925896 It's just common practice. We<br />always have a synthetic on board.
1925920 1928436 I prefer the term<br />"artificial person" myself.
1928460 1930396 Right.
1930420 1933156 - Is there a problem?<br />- I'm sorry.
1933180 1935156 I don't know why I didn't even...
1935180 1938656 Ripley's last trip out, the syn—<br />The artificial person malfunctioned.
1938680 1939746 Malfunctioned?
1939770 1943626 There were problems and<br />a few deaths were involved.
1943650 1946916 I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
1946940 1949666 The hyperdyne systems 120-a2.
1949690 1952336 That explains it then. The<br />a2s always were a bit twitchy.
1952360 1955136 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1955160 1956756 <i>It is impossible for me to harm,</i>
1956780 1959806 <i>or by omission of action, allow<br />to be harmed, a human being.</i>
1959830 1964096 You sure you don't want some?
1964120 1966710 You just stay away from me,<br />bishop. You got that straight?
1969510 1972760 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1986190 1989336 Squad, ten-hut! Officer on deck!
1989360 1990376 As you were.
1990400 1993296 Quickly, quickly. Settle down.
1993320 1996386 All right. Listen up!
1996410 1997426 Morning, marines.
1997450 2001556 I'm sorry we didn't have time to<br />brief you people before we left gateway
2001580 2004096 - <i>sir?<br />- What is it, Hicks?</i>
2004120 2007266 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
2007290 2010276 What's the question?
2010300 2014146 Is this gonna be a stand-up<br />fight, sir, or another bug hunt?
2014170 2018326 All we know is that there's<br />still no contact with the colony,
2018350 2021286 and that a xenomorph may be involved.
2021310 2024076 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
2024100 2026416 It's a bug hunt.
2026440 2031206 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
2031230 2033716 I'll tell you what I know.
2033740 2036216 We set down on lv-426.
2036240 2038596 <i>One of our crew members<br />was brought back on board</i>
2038620 2040306 <i>with something attached to his face,</i>
2040330 2042886 some kind of parasite.
2042910 2045306 We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.
2045330 2048306 <i>Later, it seemed to<br />come off by itself and die.</i>
2048330 2050936 Kane seemed fine.
2050960 2053146 We were all having dinner, and,
2053170 2057406 it must have laid something inside<br />his throat, some sort of embryo.
2057430 2061446 - He started— he—<br />- Look, man.
2061470 2066616 I only need to know one<br />thing— where they are.
2066640 2069456 - Yo, vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2069480 2071456 Right, right. Somebody said "alien."
2071480 2074416 She thought they said<br />"illegal alien" and signed up.
2074440 2076466 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2076490 2079110 Are you finished?
2084290 2087000 I hope you're right. I really do.
2089250 2092356 Yeah, okay, right. Thank you, Ripley.
2092380 2095396 We also have Ripley's report<br />on disk. I suggest you study it.
2095420 2097196 Because just one of those things
2097220 2100366 managed to wipe out my<br />entire crew in less than 24 hours.
2100390 2103196 <i>And if the colonists have found<br />that ship, then there's no telling</i>
2103220 2104946 <i>how many of them have been exposed.</i>
2104970 2107390 <i>Do you understand?</i>
2109140 2112456 Anyway, we have it on<br />disk, so you better look at it.
2112480 2115206 <i>Any questions?</i>
2115230 2117666 What is it, private?
2117690 2120756 How do I get out of<br />this chickenshit outfit?
2120780 2122530 You secure that shit, Hudson.
2125200 2127346 All right.
2127370 2130210 Now listen up.
2131580 2133766 I want this thing to go smooth,
2133790 2136396 and by the numbers.
2136420 2140880 I want d.C.S. And tactical<br />database assimilation by 0830.
2141890 2144026 Ordinance loading, weapons<br />strip and drop-ship prep details
2144050 2146496 - will have seven hours.<br />- Come on.
2146520 2148746 Now, move it, people!
2148770 2149826 All right, sweethearts.
2149850 2151536 You heard the man,<br />and you know the drill.
2151560 2155730 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
2171000 2173056 I don't care if you are<br />short, Hudson. Get it done.
2173080 2175726 Hey, sarge. You'll get<br />lip cancer smoking those.
2175750 2178986 Corporal, I want this<br />loading lock sealed. Now!
2179010 2181486 - How many more you got, spunkmeyer?<br />- Last one.
2181510 2183550 Good. Take it away.
2200990 2203070 Clear behind.
2209240 2211936 <i>Did you check number<br />three? Let me see that.</i>
2211960 2215936 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
2215960 2218340 I don't know. Is there<br />anything you can do?
2221300 2223606 Well, I can drive that loader.
2223630 2227366 <i>I have a class 2 rating.</i>
2227390 2229470 Be my guest.
2275020 2278996 Where you want it?
2279020 2282400 Bay 12, please.
2338830 2340436 <i>All right, sweethearts. We're a team,</i>
2340460 2342356 <i>and there's nothing to worry about.</i>
2342380 2345986 <i>We come here, and we gonna<br />conquer, and we gonna kick some.</i>
2346010 2348066 <i>Is that understood? That's<br />what we gonna do, sweethearts.</i>
2348090 2348946 Yes, sir.
2348970 2351366 <i>- We are going to go and get some.<br />- Hey.</i>
2351390 2354236 <i>All right, people! On the ready line!</i>
2354260 2357116 - Are you lean? Are you mean?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
2357140 2359826 - What are you? What are you?<br />- Lean and mean!
2359850 2362706 <i>Hudson! Get on the ready line, marine!</i>
2362730 2365756 Get some today! Get on the ready line!
2365780 2368756 - Yo!<br />- Move it out! Move it out, goddamn it!
2368780 2372426 <i>Get hot! One, two, three!<br />Get out, get out, get out!</i>
2372450 2375990 Move it out, move it out, move it out!<br />Move it out, move it out, move it out!
2378750 2382436 Absolutely badasses.
2382460 2384936 Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!
2384960 2387026 <i>All right! Move it!</i>
2387050 2389776 - Let's go, let's go!<br />- One, two, three,
2389800 2393326 four, five, six!
2393350 2397786 <i>All right. I want combat<br />seating. You know your places.</i>
2397810 2400166 <i>Get those weapons stowed. Let's go.</i>
2400190 2403586 <i>Come on. Settle down, people.</i>
2403610 2405796 <i>Lock 'em in, Hudson.</i>
2405820 2409256 - Ready to get it on?<br />- You know it!
2409280 2412006 Okay, bishop, let's go.
2412030 2414200 Roger.
2415990 2418806 I'm ready, man.
2418830 2422330 Ready to get it on! Go!
2426460 2428986 Stand by. Cross-locking now.
2429010 2430470 Prelaunch autocycle engaged.
2433720 2437720 Primary couplers<br />released. Hit the internals.
2449280 2450166 Shit, man.
2450190 2452046 <i>Confirm cross-lock and<br />drop stations secured.</i>
2452070 2456200 <i>Affirmative. All drop stations secured.</i>
2459870 2462410 Stand by. Ten seconds.
2465040 2469146 Stand by to initiate release<br />sequencer… on my Mark.
2469170 2470526 <i>Five, four, three,</i>
2470550 2473906 we're on an express<br />elevator to hell, going down.
2473930 2476890 Two, one, Mark.
2478050 2480430 Woo-hoo!
2492690 2494740 Switch to d.C.S. Ranging.
2495320 2497136 <i>240, nominal to profile.</i>
2497160 2499870 <i>We're in the pipe, five by five.</i>
2510590 2512816 We're picking up some hull ionization.
2512840 2515356 Got it. Rough air ahead.
2515380 2517640 <i>We're in for some chop.</i>
2531270 2533610 How many drops is<br />this for you, lieutenant?
2535950 2538426 Thirty-eight.
2538450 2540466 Simulated.
2540490 2542676 How many combat drops?
2542700 2546806 Two… including this one.
2546830 2550170 - Shit.<br />- Man!
2562850 2567060 Range 014. Turning on final.
2571940 2574876 <i>And I'm telling you, I got a<br />bad feeling about this drop.</i>
2574900 2576296 <i>You always say that, frost.</i>
2576320 2578386 <i>You always say, “I got a<br />bad feeling about this drop. ”</i>
2578410 2580926 <i>Okay, okay. When we<br />get back without you,</i>
2580950 2583950 <i>I'll call your folks.</i>
2586200 2590396 All right. Let's see what we can see.
2590420 2593880 Everybody online. Looking good.
2595710 2598030 Drake, check your camera.<br />There seems to be a malfunction.
2599430 2602736 <i>That's better. Pan it around a bit.</i>
2602760 2605946 - Good.<br />- I'm ready, man. Check it out.
2605970 2607786 I am the ultimate badass.
2607810 2609116 - Yeah.<br />- That's right.
2609140 2613166 State-of-the-badass art. You<br />do not want to fuck with me.
2613190 2614626 <i>Who here's runnin'?</i>
2614650 2617530 <i>Check it out.</i>
2618740 2621546 Hey, Ripley, don't worry.
2621570 2624756 Me and my squad of ultimate<br />badasses will protect you.
2624780 2626766 - Hey!<br />- That's right.
2626790 2629016 Check it out.
2629040 2632646 Independently targeting<br />particle-beam phalanx.
2632670 2636356 <i>Fry half a city with this puppy.</i>
2636380 2638816 We got tactical smart missiles,
2638840 2641316 phase-plasma pulse rifles, r.P.G.'S.
2641340 2644866 <i>- We got Sonic, - electronic ball breakers!<br />- Whoo!</i>
2644890 2648286 We got nukes, we<br />got knives, sharp sticks
2648310 2651286 <i>knock it off, Hudson. All right, gear up.</i>
2651310 2655166 <i>Two minutes, people. Get hot.</i>
2655190 2656900 Somebody wake up Hicks.
2670410 2672936 Coming around for a 709er.
2672960 2675896 - Terminal guidance locked in.<br />- Where's the damn beacon?
2675920 2678420 <i>I see it.</i>
2684590 2687946 - That's the atmosphere processor?<br />- Yep, that's it.
2687970 2691326 <i>Remarkable piece of<br />machinery. Completely automated.</i>
2691350 2693900 You know, we manufacture<br />those, by the way.
2703530 2708740 <i>Okay, ferro. Take us in low<br />over the main colony complex.</i>
2710450 2712596 <i>Storm shutters are sealed.</i>
2712620 2715210 <i>There's no visible<br />activity. All right. Hold at 40.</i>
2716630 2719460 - Roger.<br />- Give me a slow circle of the complex.
2727350 2731746 Structure seems intact.<br />They still have power.
2731770 2736036 Okay, ferro. Set down<br />on the landing grid.
2736060 2738940 <i>Immediate dust off on my<br />clear, then stay on station.</i>
2753000 2755330 <i>Down and clear.</i>
2756500 2758670 <i>Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.</i>
2761710 2765050 All right. I want a nice,<br />clean dispersal this time.
2766720 2768866 <i>Let's go! Move it out!</i>
2768890 2770890 <i>Head 'em up!</i>
2791780 2796056 First squad up on line. Hicks, get<br />yours in accord and watch the rear.
2796080 2799710 Vasquez, take point. Let's move!
2807090 2809050 Move up.
2810930 2814020 Hudson, run a bypass.
2819440 2822416 Second squad, move<br />up. Flanking positions.
2822440 2825150 Second squad on line.
2853180 2855260 You set?
2858310 2860310 Go on.
2885750 2888670 Second team, move inside.<br />Hicks, take the upper level.
2916700 2921766 Sir, you copying this? Looks<br />like hits from small-arms fire.
2921790 2924936 <i>We got some explosives damage.</i>
2924960 2927276 It's probably seismic survey charges.
2927300 2931090 Are you reading this?<br />Keep it tight, people.
2944350 2948320 All right. Hicks, Hudson,<br />use your motion trackers.
2966130 2969460 Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
2974380 2977220 Quarter and search by twos.
2988650 2991610 Okay. Dietrich, frost, you're up.
3038780 3040620 It's right in there.
3053000 3053896 - Now!<br />- Now!
3053920 3058776 - Haah! —<br />- Good one, Hudson!
3058800 3062026 <i>Sir, we have a negative situation here.</i>
3062050 3063930 <i>Movin' on, sir.</i>
3072980 3075940 <i>Wait. Wait, tell him to</i>
3076940 3080660 Hicks, back up. Pan right.
3081820 3087476 - There.<br />- You seeing this all right?
3087500 3093106 Looks melted. Somebody must have<br />bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.
3093130 3095146 Acid for blood.
3095170 3098760 If you like that, you're gonna love this.
3111940 3113706 Quit screwing around.
3113730 3115546 Second squad, what's your status?
3115570 3118756 We just finished our<br />sweep. Nobody's home.
3118780 3121426 Roger. Sir, this place is dead.
3121450 3124136 Whatever happened<br />here, I think we missed it.
3124160 3125886 All right. The area's secured.
3125910 3128226 Let's go in and see what<br />their computer can tell us.
3128250 3131146 - Wait a minute. It's not secure.<br />- The area's secured, Ripley.
3131170 3132960 <i>First team, head for operations.</i>
3134380 3136436 Hudson, see if you can<br />get their c.P.U. On line.
3136460 3137396 Affirmative.
3137420 3140026 Hicks, meet me at the<br />south lock. We're coming in.
3140050 3140946 Roger.
3140970 3144326 He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
3144350 3146390 <i>Pendejo jerk-off.</i>
3166450 3169136 <i>Sir, we got the c.P.U. On line.</i>
3169160 3170476 <i>No problem.</i>
3170500 3173210 Good. Stand by in operations.
3174210 3176250 Okay, let's go.
3196610 3198270 Are you all right?
3199480 3201150 Yes.
3217750 3221816 <i>Sir, they sealed off<br />this wing at both ends,</i>

3226430 3229286 <i>But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.</i>
3229310 3231496 - Any bodies?<br />- No, sir.
3231520 3233496 Last stand.
3233520 3236036 <i>Must have been a hell of a fight.</i>
3236060 3238690 Yeah, looks that way.
3240610 3242796 <i>All right, Drake, this way.</i>
3242820 3245820 <i>We should be able to cut<br />through the med lab to operations.</i>
3297620 3299540 <i>Lieutenant.</i>
3301380 3303380 Gorman.
3320270 3321940 Are those the same ones that...
3335200 3337250 Careful, Burke.
3346840 3350816 Looks like love at first sight to me.
3350840 3353236 <i>He likes you, Burke.</i>
3353260 3355890 Two are alive. The rest are dead.
3357770 3360786 "Surgically removed<br />before embryo implantation.
3360810 3365586 Subject marachek, John j.,<br />died during the procedure."
3365610 3367990 They killed him taking it off.
3368240 3372336 Yo, Hicks.
3372360 3374910 I think we got something here.
3379660 3381620 - Behind us.<br />- One of us?
3382920 3386476 <i>Apone, where are your<br />people? Anybody in “d” block?</i>
3386500 3389340 That's a negative. We're all in operations.
3392340 3394446 Talk to me, frosty.
3394470 3396430 Let's keep moving, baby.
3414870 3416886 - It's moving.<br />- Which way?
3416910 3420450 It's coming straight for us. Straight up.
3457990 3459950 - Fuck!<br />- Hold up.
3461540 3463040 Ripley.
3482560 3485746 Hey. Shh. It's all right.
3485770 3488086 - It's all right. Come on.<br />- Just grab her, corporal.
3488110 3491256 <i>Don't be afraid. Come<br />on. We won't hurt you.</i>
3491280 3493626 <i>Shh. It's all right. It's okay.</i>
3493650 3495876 <i>Come on out. Come on.</i>
3495900 3498046 <i>- Easy. Easy.<br />- I got her.</i>
3498070 3500056 Damn!
3500080 3502926 - Watch her! She's under the grille!<br />- Don't let her go.
3502950 3506250 - Frost, get your light up here.<br />- Where'd she go?
3509170 3513066 - Shine the light.<br />- Here. Here.
3513090 3514856 - Here. Here.<br />- There she is.
3514880 3517566 <i>Keep back. Keep back. Don't scare her.</i>
3517590 3519406 <i>Grab her, man. We're gonna lose her.</i>
3519430 3520430 <i>Damn it!</i>
3522560 3524480 <i>Kick it out!</i>
3525520 3528690 Wait.
3554340 3557300 It's okay. It's all right.
3558300 3562156 <i>Don't be afraid.</i>
3562180 3564326 <i>See?</i>
3564350 3566326 Wait. No, you don't.
3566350 3569876 It's okay. You're gonna be all right now.
3569900 3572036 Shh.
3572060 3576296 Easy. Easy. It's gonna be okay.
3576320 3578876 It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
3578900 3581006 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
3581030 3584120 Easy. Easy.
3620110 3622676 - What's her name again?<br />- Rebecca.
3622700 3626716 Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.
3626740 3629636 Just start at the beginning.
3629660 3632766 Where are your parents?
3632790 3635066 Now, look, Rebecca,<br />you have to try and help
3635090 3637710 gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?
3640050 3642866 Total brain lock.
3642890 3644866 Physically, she's okay.
3644890 3646326 Borderline malnutrition,
3646350 3648156 but I don't think there's<br />any permanent damage.
3648180 3650600 Come on. We're wasting our time.
3660150 3662546 Try this.
3662570 3664910 It's a little hot chocolate.
3666410 3668886 There you go.
3668910 3671176 Whoop.
3671200 3673170 That good?
3677540 3681066 I made a clean spot here.
3681090 3684890 Now I've done it. Guess I'll<br />have to do the whole thing.
3694440 3697980 Hard to believe there's<br />a little girl under all this.
3699980 3702150 And a pretty one too.
3706200 3708780 You don't talk much, do you?
3717790 3719816 Smoking or nonsmoking?
3719840 3721816 Just tell me what you're<br />scanning for, private.
3721840 3723816 - P.d.t.s.<br />- What?
3723840 3725816 Personal data transmitters.
3725840 3728446 Every colonist had<br />one surgically implanted.
3728470 3731696 If they're within 20 klicks,<br />we'll read it out here.
3731720 3733956 So far, zippo.
3733980 3736956 I don't know how you<br />managed to stay alive,
3736980 3739360 but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
3741360 3743320 N-Newt.
3745320 3748886 - What'd you say?<br />- Newt.
3748910 3751176 My name's newt.
3751200 3756396 Nobody calls me<br />Rebecca except my brother.
3756420 3760356 Newt? I like that.
3760380 3764170 I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.
3766170 3769366 And who is this?
3769390 3773156 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3773180 3776206 What about your<br />brother? What's his name?
3776230 3778326 Timmy.
3778350 3782820 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3785860 3787820 Any sisters?
3791450 3793370 Mom and dad?
3796200 3800516 Newt, look at me. Where are they?
3800540 3803590 They're dead, all right? Can I go now?
3806720 3809236 I'm sorry, newt.
3809260 3811850 Don't you think you'd<br />be safer here with us?
3815720 3817826 These people are here to protect you.
3817850 3819876 <i>They're soldiers.</i>
3819900 3822730 It won't make any difference.
3836200 3838250 Need anything else?
3840790 3843750 Hello, bishop. Do you<br />need anything else?
3845630 3847670 No.
3849760 3851946 That's a nice pet you got there, bishop.
3851970 3854946 Magnificent, isn't it?
3854970 3860076 Yo! Stop your grinnin' and<br />drop your linen! Found 'em.
3860100 3862706 - They alive?<br />- Unknown,
3862730 3864706 but it looks like all of them.
3864730 3868966 <i>Over at the processing<br />station, sublevel 3,</i>
3868990 3871450 <i>under the main cooling towers.</i>
3872660 3875346 Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
3875370 3877346 Let's saddle up, apone.
3877370 3879726 Aye, sir.
3879750 3882396 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.
3882420 3884436 Let's go. Head 'em out!
3884460 3886380 <i>Okay, frost, you're driving.</i>
3898270 3901730 It's okay. Don't worry. It'll be okay.
3942270 3944496 I want a straight "v" deployment,
3944520 3946326 second team on left flank.
3946350 3950456 Advance on axial 664. Tracker on line.
3950480 3953676 Set the "v" gain to filter r.F. Ambient.
3953700 3957200 Hudson, tracker on line.<br />Left and right, little buddy.
3959030 3963266 Forty meters in, bearing 221,<br />there should be a stairwell.
3963290 3965250 Check. Got it.
3966710 3968630 You want sublevel 3.
3970840 3973146 Let's go, people.<br />Hudson, you got the point.
3973170 3975606 Hicks, watch our tails.
3975630 3978866 Nice and easy. Check those corners.
3978890 3981140 Check those corners.
3984520 3985786 Watch your spacing.
3985810 3987206 All right. You heard the man.
3987230 3989206 Don't bunch up. Stay loose.
3989230 3992046 <i>Your transmission's<br />showing a lot of breakup.</i>
3992070 3996336 Probably getting some<br />interference from the structure.
3996360 3998546 Use those lights.
3998570 4003016 <i>Next one down, and proceed on a 216.</i>
4003040 4005210 <i>Roger. That's a 216.</i>
4007420 4010476 <i>I'm not making that out<br />too well. What is it, Hudson?</i>
4010500 4013460 You tell me, man. I only work here.
4028560 4030706 What is that?
4030730 4032940 I don't know.
4034650 4036950 Proceed inside.
4052750 4055686 Watch your fire and check your targets.
4055710 4058050 Remember we're<br />looking for civvies in here.
4067850 4069826 Easy.
4069850 4072310 Tighten it up, frost.<br />We're getting a little thin.
4074110 4076400 <i>Nice and easy.</i>
4078700 4080676 Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
4080700 4084556 Yeah, but secreted from what?
4084580 4087306 Nobody touch nothing.
4087330 4090346 Busy little creatures?
4090370 4092686 Hot as hell in here.
4092710 4094686 Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.
4094710 4096670 <i>Knock it off, Hudson.</i>
4104600 4107996 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
4108020 4110456 <i>Ten millimeter explosive-tip case less.</i>
4110480 4112496 Standard light armor-piercing round.
4112520 4114836 - Why?<br />- Well, look where your team is.
4114860 4118166 <i>They're right under the<br />primary heat exchangers.</i>
4118190 4120256 So?
4120280 4124046 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
4124070 4127346 Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.
4127370 4128386 So? So what?
4128410 4132686 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
4132710 4135146 Right?
4135170 4139896 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and adios, muchachos.
4139920 4142606 Great. Wonderful.
4142630 4145430 Shit!
4147390 4151230 Look. … Apone.
4152560 4156036 Look. We can't have any firing in there.
4156060 4159876 I, I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
4159900 4160966 Is he fuckin' crazy?
4160990 4164006 What the hell are we supposed<br />to use, man, harsh language?
4164030 4166926 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I
4166950 4169910 just do it, sergeant. And no grenades.
4171620 4173596 All right, sweethearts.<br />You heard the man.
4173620 4175710 Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.
4176710 4179420 <i>Come on, vasquez. Clear and lock.</i>
4182300 4184656 Damn!
4184680 4186866 <i>You too. Give it up,<br />ski. Come on. Let's go.</i>
4186890 4189906 <i>Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.</i>
4189930 4191890 Right on, vas.
4193140 4195126 Let's go, marine. Give it up.
4195150 4197336 Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.
4197360 4200296 - Thanks a lot, sarge.<br />- Hicks, cover our ass.
4200320 4202240 Head 'em out, people.
4204320 4207966 I like to keep this handy…<br />for close encounters.
4207990 4209870 I heard that.
4218840 4220816 Any movement?
4220840 4223510 Nothing. Zip.
4236230 4238650 Holy shit.
4251450 4254016 <i>Newt, go sit up front.</i>
4254040 4256540 Go on! Now!
4285190 4288006 Steady, people. Let's finish our sweep.
4288030 4291506 We're still marines,<br />and we got a job to do.
4291530 4295250 Keep it moving. Easy.
4327240 4328926 - Help!<br />- What?
4328950 4331756 <i>Top, get over here. We got a<br />live one! You're gonna be all right.</i>
4331780 4335006 Please… k-kill me.
4335030 4337976 Just stay calm. We're<br />gonna get you outta here.
4338000 4340646 <i>It's gonna be all right. Give me a<br />hand. We gotta get her outta here.</i>
4340670 4343106 - What is it, Dietrich?<br />- Convulsion!
4343130 4345856 Dietrich, get back!
4345880 4348260 Get back!
4355390 4358746 - No!<br />- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!
4358770 4361390 <i>Get back! Flamethrower! Move!</i>
4391220 4392986 Movement!
4393010 4397826 - What's the position?<br />- I can't lock in!
4397850 4400286 Talk to me, Hudson!
4400310 4403536 Multiple signals.
4403560 4405746 <i>They're closing.</i>
4405770 4409126 Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!
4409150 4412546 What's happening, apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
4412570 4414490 Pull your team out, gorman.
4420330 4423136 I got signals. I got<br />readings in front and behind.
4423160 4425436 Where, man? I don't see shit.
4425460 4428016 <i>He's right. There's nothing back here.</i>
4428040 4430640 Look, I'm telling you. There's<br />something moving, and it ain't us!
4432550 4435616 - Shit.<br />- Tracker's off scale, man.
4435640 4438986 They're all around us, man! Jesus!
4439010 4441930 Maybe they don't show<br />up on infrared at all.
4452190 4454650 <i>Frost!</i>
4458780 4460740 Come on!
4467210 4469856 Jesus Christ, apone! What is going on?
4469880 4472896 <i>Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!</i>
4472920 4476930 - Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off! Frost!<br />- Dietrich, frost, off the board!
4478340 4479600 Frost!
4481260 4484866 Wierzbowski?
4484890 4487706 <i>Wierzbowski?</i>
4487730 4491400 Let's rock!
4494110 4495740 Who's firing? Goddamn it!
4496740 4498046 Yeah!
4498070 4499546 I ordered to hold fire.
4499570 4502176 They're coming out of the walls!
4502200 4504636 They're coming out of the<br />goddamn walls! Let's book!
4504660 4506936 - On the right, man.<br />- Apone,
4506960 4509766 I want you to lay down a<br />suppressing fire with the incinerators
4509790 4512606 vasquez, Drake, hold<br />your fire, goddamn it!
4512630 4516606 Apone, are you copying me? I<br />want you to lay down suppressing fire
4516630 4519236 with the incinerators and fall<br />back by squads to the a.P.C.
4519260 4521696 - Over.<br />- Say again, all after "incinerator."
4521720 4525576 I said I want you to lay down a<br />suppressing fire with the incinerators
4525600 4529060 and fall back… by<br />squads to the a.P.C. Over.
4529980 4531020 Hey!
4532980 4535466 - Sarge! Sarge!<br />- Apone.

4702110 4705926 - Come on. Put it out!<br />- Drake's coming, man!
4705950 4708910 - Drake! No, he's not!<br />- He's gone!
4710330 4712290 Forget him! He's gone!
4718130 4720040 They're in the goddamn door!
4723460 4726236 Eat this!
4726260 4729406 Ripley!
4729430 4731760 <i>Go, go, go!</i>
4794540 4796516 It's all right! We're clear!
4796540 4799016 Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
4799040 4801016 You're just grinding metal!
4801040 4803316 Come on, ease down.
4803340 4809220 Ease down. Ease down. Ease down.
4820900 4823150 You okay?
4824520 4826626 - I'm all right.<br />- Hudson.
4826650 4828796 Get away from me, man!
4828820 4832886 <i>- Lieutenant.<br />- What happened to gorman?</i>
4832910 4836216 I don't know. Maybe a concussion.
4836240 4838596 - But he's alive.<br />- He's dead!
4838620 4840766 Wake up, pendejo, and<br />then I'm gonna kill you!
4840790 4844000 Back off. Right now.
4845460 4848686 - Fuck!<br />- Somebody get me a first aid kit.
4848710 4851906 Hey. Hey, look.
4851930 4855276 The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
4855300 4857366 Their signs are real<br />low, but they ain't dead.
4857390 4859746 - Then we go back in there and get them.<br />- Fuck that!
4859770 4862206 <i>We don't leave our people<br />behind— - I ain't going back in there.</i>
4862230 4864746 You can't help them!
4864770 4869440 You can't. Right now they're<br />being cocooned just like the others.
4873740 4877096 Dear lord Jesus, this<br />ain't happenin', man.
4877120 4878056 Damn it.
4878080 4881120 This can't be happenin',<br />man. This isn't happenin'!
4881370 4884856 All right. We got seven<br />canisters of on-20.
4884880 4888276 I say we roll them in there and<br />nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4888300 4889486 That's worth a try,
4889510 4891146 but we don't even know<br />if it's gonna affect them.
4891170 4893986 Let's just bug out and call it even. Okay?
4894010 4895696 What are we talking about this for?
4895720 4899430 I say we take off and nuke<br />the entire site from orbit.
4902310 4904286 It's the only way to be sure.
4904310 4907626 - Fuckin' "a"!<br />- Hold on. Hold on one second.
4907650 4911876 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4911900 4914466 They can bill me.
4914490 4919596 Okay, look. This is an emotional<br />moment for all of us, okay?
4919620 4923096 I know that. But let's not<br />make snap judgments, please.
4923120 4926146 This is clearly— clearly an<br />important species we're dealing with,
4926170 4928976 and I don't think that you<br />or I or anybody has the right
4929000 4932146 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4932170 4933776 Yeah. Watch us.
4933800 4936156 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4936180 4938906 but we just got our asses kicked, pal!
4938930 4942326 Look. I'm not blind to what's going on,
4942350 4944996 but I cannot authorize that kind of action.
4945020 4947100 I'm sorry.
4948230 4951206 Well, I believe corporal Hicks
4951230 4953190 has authority here.
4954700 4956676 Corporal Hicks is
4956700 4959136 <i>this operation is under<br />military jurisdiction,</i>
4959160 4961136 <i>and Hicks is next in chain of command.</i>
4961160 4963386 Am I right, corporal?
4963410 4965370 Yeah.
4966540 4969146 Yeah, that's right.
4969170 4971276 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4971300 4973816 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4973840 4975816 He can't make that kind of decision.
4975840 4978486 He's just a grunt. No offense.
4978510 4982326 - None taken. Ferro, do you copy?<br />- Standing by.
4982350 4985076 Prep for dust off. We're<br />gonna need immediate evac.
4985100 4987076 <i>Roger. On our way.</i>
4987100 4991730 <i>I say we take off, nuke the site<br />from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.</i>
4994360 4996070 Let's do it.
5003200 5006750 Let's go. Pick it up,<br />Hudson. Pick it up, baby.
5011960 5014130 All right. Set him down here.
5020720 5022760 Move it, spunkmeyer. We're rolling.
5027940 5029916 Hold on a second. There's something
5029940 5032286 just get up here.
5032310 5034820 I'm in. Ramp closing.
5054550 5056510 Spunkmeyer.
5057720 5061446 Goddamn it.
5061470 5063800 Well, where the fuck...
5076570 5078490 Run!
5119360 5123216 Well, that's great. That's<br />just fuckin' great, man.
5123240 5125756 Now what the fuck<br />are we supposed to do?
5125780 5128136 We're in some real pretty shit now, man!
5128160 5130540 Are you finished?
5133370 5135330 You all right?
5140550 5144816 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
5144840 5146526 I'm sorry, newt.
5146550 5149496 You don't have to be<br />sorry. It wasn't your fault.
5149520 5150536 That's it, man.
5150560 5152996 Game over, man! Game over!
5153020 5155706 What the fuck are we gonna<br />do now? What are we gonna do?
5155730 5158916 Maybe we could build a<br />fire. Sing a couple of songs?
5158940 5160206 Why don't we try that?
5160230 5163046 We'd better get back<br />'cause it'll be dark soon,
5163070 5166450 and they mostly come at night, mostly.
5183260 5187316 That's everything, right? All<br />right. This is absolutely everything
5187340 5190406 that we could salvage<br />out of the a.P.C. Wreckage.
5190430 5194076 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
5194100 5196286 That ain't so good.
5196310 5200086 We got, 15 of these m-40 grenades.
5200110 5202126 <i>Don't touch that.</i>
5202150 5204676 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
5204700 5208796 <i>Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.</i>
5208820 5212636 <i>Got another one, it's damaged—<br />I don't know about that one.</i>
5212660 5218516 But the good news— we got<br />four of these robot sentries,
5218540 5221646 with display and scanners intact.
5221670 5224896 They really kick ass. I<br />think they'll come in handy.
5224920 5229340 How long after we're declared<br />overdue can we expect a rescue?
5231390 5233520 Seventeen days.
5234520 5237116 Seventeen days?
5237140 5239076 Hey, man, I don't wanna<br />rain on your parade,
5239100 5241086 but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
5241110 5243626 <i>Those things are gonna come<br />in here like they did before.</i>
5243650 5244836 <i>They're gonna come in here...</i>
5244860 5245756 Hudson! Hudson!
5245780 5248006 <i>They're gonna come in<br />here and they're gonna get us!</i>
5248030 5250136 This little girl survived longer than that
5250160 5253266 with no weapons and no training.
5253290 5255200 Right?
5257580 5260356 Why don't you put her in charge?
5260380 5263276 You'd better just start dealing<br />with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
5263300 5265526 Hudson, just deal with<br />it because we need you.
5265550 5267526 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
5267550 5271196 Now, I want you to get on a terminal<br />and call up some kind of floor plan file.
5271220 5273986 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
5274010 5276456 Anything that shows the layout<br />of this place. Are you listening?
5276480 5279626 - Yeah.<br />- I need to see air ducts.
5279650 5283086 I need to see electrical<br />access tunnels, subbasements,
5283110 5286876 <i>every possible way into this complex.</i>
5286900 5291466 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
5291490 5293846 - Okay, I'm on it.<br />- Hudson!
5293870 5298540 Just relax.
5301960 5307066 I'll be in med lab. I'll check on<br />gorman, continue my analysis.
5307090 5310010 Fine. You do that.
5316220 5320116 So this service tunnel must be<br />how they're moving back and forth.
5320140 5322706 That's right. It moves<br />from the processing station
5322730 5325070 right into the sublevel here.
5327110 5330506 Come down on that. Okay, come over.
5330530 5333740 Hold. Go back. Okay,<br />punch that in right there.
5339410 5341460 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
5343000 5345726 Well, there's a pressure door at this end.
5345750 5349026 <i>Couldn't we put one of the<br />remote sentry units in the tunnel</i>
5349050 5350446 <i>and then seal that door?</i>
5350470 5353526 Yeah, that'll work, but we gotta<br />figure on them getting into the complex.
5353550 5354866 <i>That's right,</i>
5354890 5358656 <i>so we repair the barricades<br />at these two intersections.</i>
5358680 5359746 Right.
5359770 5361416 And weld plate steel over these ducts
5361440 5365876 here and here and here.
5365900 5368956 That way they can only come<br />at us from these two corridors.
5368980 5374756 All right. Then we put the other<br />sentry units here and here, right?
5374780 5377306 <i>- Right.<br />- Outstanding.</i>
5377330 5379290 Now all we need is a deck of cards.
5381580 5383766 All right, people. Let's<br />move like we got a purpose.
5383790 5386540 <i>- Affirmative.<br />- Affirmative.</i>
5401810 5405536 <i>Do your thing, baby. Come on,<br />vasquez. Let's get the hell outta here.</i>
5405560 5408496 Hudson here. "A" and "b"<br />sentries are in place and keyed.
5408520 5413466 Roger. Stand by. Arming<br />now. Test it, Hudson.
5413490 5415860 - Do it!<br />- Fire in the hole!
5419120 5421976 <i>Okay, great. Let's get the hell outta here!</i>
5422000 5425460 We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.
5437640 5439550 For what it's worth.
5441520 5443810 Here. I want you to put this on.
5445190 5447496 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
5447520 5450980 Then I can find you anywhere<br />in the complex on this.
5452820 5456966 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.
5456990 5459846 Doesn't mean we're<br />engaged or anything.
5459870 5461870 All right, what's next?
5491480 5493530 Last stop.
5497530 5499506 Get in.
5499530 5503676 Scoot down. That's good.
5503700 5507806 Now, you lie here and<br />have a nap. You're very tired.
5507830 5511210 I don't want to. I have scary dreams.
5513590 5516736 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
5516760 5518736 Let's take a look.
5518760 5521156 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
5521180 5525536 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her?
5525560 5528116 Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams
5528140 5531246 because she's just a piece of plastic.
5531270 5534770 Right. I'm sorry, newt.
5541490 5543806 There.
5543830 5546766 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters
5546790 5550120 no real ones— but there are.
5551460 5553420 Yes, there are, aren't there?
5555500 5557840 Why do they tell little kids that?
5559720 5561696 Most of the time it's true.
5561720 5565236 Did one of those things grow inside her?
5565260 5568116 I don't know, newt.
5568140 5570166 That's the truth.
5570190 5574876 Isn't that how babies come?<br />I mean, people babies?
5574900 5578506 - They grow inside you.<br />- That's very different.
5578530 5580506 Did you ever have a baby?
5580530 5583926 Yes, I did. I had a little girl.
5583950 5588500 - Where is she?<br />- She's gone.
5590330 5592290 You mean dead.
5593880 5594880 Here.
5596210 5598050 Take this.
5599670 5601510 For luck.
5604720 5606680 There's that.
5608850 5610826 Don't go, please.
5610850 5614456 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
5614480 5616456 And you see that camera right up there?
5616480 5619336 <i>I can see you right through that camera,</i>
5619360 5621700 all the time to see if you're safe.
5626070 5628806 I'm not gonna leave you, newt.
5628830 5632806 I mean that. That's a promise.
5632830 5635556 You promise?
5635580 5637936 I cross my heart.
5637960 5642260 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
5657150 5661610 Now go to sleep, and don't dream.
5665780 5667740 Sneak.
5676540 5679356 <i>The molecular acid oxidizes<br />after the creature's death,</i>
5679380 5680816 <i>completely neutralizing it.</i>
5680840 5682486 Bishop, you know, that's very interesting,
5682510 5684316 but it doesn't really get<br />us anywhere, does it?
5684340 5686946 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
5686970 5689116 Let's go through it again.
5689140 5691406 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there,
5691430 5695826 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
5695850 5699746 Which would mean that there would<br />have to be a lot of these parasites, right?
5699770 5702006 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
5702030 5704006 Yes. That follows.
5704030 5708070 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
5710620 5712596 So who's laying these eggs?
5712620 5715766 I'm not sure.
5715790 5717806 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
5717830 5720106 Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.
5720130 5722226 Bees, man. Bees have hives.
5722250 5727486 You know what I mean. There's, like,<br />one female that runs the whole show.
5727510 5729946 - Yes, the queen.<br />- Yeah, the mama.
5729970 5732406 She's badass, man. I mean, big.
5732430 5735036 - These things ain't ants, estúpido.<br />- I know that.
5735060 5739786 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
5739810 5742796 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions
5742820 5744876 that they were to be kept alive in stasis
5744900 5746650 for return to the company labs.
5748860 5750820 He was very specific about it.
5752280 5754466 Look. Those two<br />specimens are worth millions
5754490 5756306 to the bio-weapons division, right?
5756330 5759766 Now, if you're smart, we can<br />both come out of this heroes,
5759790 5763000 and we will be set up for life.
5764050 5766696 You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?
5766720 5769776 Do you really think you can get<br />a dangerous organism like that
5769800 5770946 past I.C.C. Quarantine?
5770970 5773906 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
5773930 5777036 But they will know<br />about it, Burke, from me.
5777060 5778286 Just like they'll know
5778310 5781376 that you were responsible<br />for the deaths of 157 colonists.
5781400 5783916 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
5783940 5786086 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
5786110 5790046 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter j.
5790070 5793096 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
5793120 5795596 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
5795620 5798176 What if that ship didn't even<br />exist? Do you ever think about that?
5798200 5801976 I didn't know. So now if I went and<br />made a major security situation out of it,
5802000 5803686 everybody steps in,<br />administration steps in,
5803710 5805436 and there's no exclusive<br />rights for anybody.
5805460 5809566 Nobody wins. So I made a<br />decision, and it was wrong.
5809590 5812406 It was a bad call,<br />Ripley. It was a bad call.
5812430 5814156 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
5814180 5815866 These people are dead, Burke!
5815890 5818366 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
5818390 5821366 I'm gonna make sure that they<br />nail you right to the wall for this!
5821390 5823706 You're not gonna sleaze<br />your way out of this one.
5823730 5825900 Right to the wall.
5827570 5828570 Ripley.
5829780 5830836 I
5830860 5832926 You know, I expected more from you.
5832950 5835966 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
5835990 5839370 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5852970 5854616 What is it? What's going on?
5854640 5856326 - They're coming.<br />- Where?
5856350 5857930 In the tunnel.
5859470 5864940 Here we go. "A" and "b" gun<br />tracking far end. Multiple targets.
5870740 5872610 Those ammo counters go.
5875280 5877410 "B" gun's down 50%.
5878580 5880830 Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.
5884790 5886606 <i>Sixty rounds left on “b. ”</i>
5886630 5889856 <i>Forty. Twenty. Ten.</i>
5889880 5892130 "B" gun's dry. Twenty on "a."
5893380 5896590 Ten. Five.
5899470 5901196 That's it.
5901220 5904480 Jesus, they were wall-to-wall in there.
5908440 5910440 They're at the pressure door.
5912030 5914046 Man, listen to that.
5914070 5917796 Bishop here. I'm afraid<br />I have some bad news.
5917820 5918830 Well, that's a switch.
5921910 5924766 It's very pretty, bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5924790 5928396 That's it. Emergency venting.
5928420 5933146 That's beautiful, man. Man,<br />that— that just beats it all.
5933170 5936106 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5936130 5939236 With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5939260 5942996 equal to about 40 megatons.
5943020 5943866 We got problems.
5943890 5946536 I don't believe this. I<br />don't fucking believe this.
5946560 5949126 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5949150 5951376 Why can't we shut it down from here?
5951400 5953376 I'm sorry. The crash<br />caused too much damage.
5953400 5956006 An overload is inevitable at this point.
5956030 5959006 Man, and I was getting short.
5959030 5962466 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5962490 5964596 <i>- It ain't half fair, man.<br />- Hudson, give us a break!</i>
5964620 5967266 <i>Four more weeks. Man.</i>
5967290 5970566 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the sulaco.
5970590 5973606 I mean, there must be some<br />way of bringing it down on remote.
5973630 5977236 How? The transmitter was<br />on the a.P.C. It's wasted.
5977260 5979946 I don't care how, but we'd<br />better think of something.
5979970 5981156 We'd better think of a way.
5981180 5982576 <i>Think of what? We're<br />fucked! We're doomed!</i>
5982600 5983486 <i>Shut up!</i>
5983510 5986366 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5986390 5989246 <i>The uplink tower down at the<br />other end. Why can't we use that?</i>
5989270 5992296 No, I checked. The hardware in<br />between here and there was damaged.
5992320 5994296 We can't align the dish.
5994320 5996796 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5996820 5999796 take a portable terminal, go<br />out there and patch in manually.
5999820 6004966 Yeah, sure. With those things<br />running around? You can count me out.
6004990 6006176 Guess we can just count<br />you out of everything.
6006200 6007096 I'll go.
6007120 6008976 <i>That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?</i>
6009000 6010896 <i>- I'll go.<br />- What?</i>
6010920 6012000 I'll go.
6012500 6015316 I mean, I'm the only one qualified<br />to remote pilot the ship anyway.
6015340 6019776 <i>Yeah, right, man. Bishop<br />should go. Good idea.</i>
6019800 6022026 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
6022050 6024970 I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
6036730 6038716 <i>How long?</i>
6038740 6042096 This conduit runs almost to<br />the uplink assembly— 180 meters.
6042120 6045466 Say 40 minutes to<br />crawl down there— - right.
6045490 6049250 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
6050330 6052686 Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
6052710 6055920 - and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />- It's gonna be close.
6060430 6063140 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.
6064600 6068390 Watch your fingers.
6069390 6070770 <i>Vaya con dios, man.</i>
6084570 6089266 <i>This is unbelievable.<br />Twenty meters and closing.</i>
6089290 6091436 - Fifteen.<br />- How many?
6091460 6094040 <i>Can't tell. Lots.</i>
6095630 6098880 "D" gun's down 50%.
6100920 6104050 "C" gun's right behind it.
6106010 6109246 <i>Stopping them. It ain't stopping them.</i>
6109270 6114326 <i>150 rounds on “d. ” -<br />come on. Come on, baby.</i>
6114350 6116706 <i>Hundred rounds.</i>
6116730 6119400 <i>Come on! Come on!</i>
6124410 6125910 "D" gun's down to 20.
6127160 6129580 <i>Ten.</i>
6130830 6132250 Damn it!
6133870 6136880 Wait! They're retreating.
6142130 6144840 <i>The guns stopped them.</i>
6146720 6148680 You're right.
6156060 6158036 Next time they walk right up and knock.
6158060 6160086 Yeah, but they don't know that.
6160110 6162860 They're probably looking<br />for other ways to get in.
6163900 6165886 That'll take 'em a while.
6165910 6168410 - Maybe we got 'em demoralized.<br />- Shut up!
6169740 6172200 I want you two walking perimeter.
6173790 6176370 Move!
6182590 6184856 Hey, listen.
6184880 6187866 We're all in strung-out shape,
6187890 6191180 but stay frosty and alert.
6192600 6195536 We can't afford to let one<br />of those bastards in here.
6195560 6197730 All right. Vámonos.
6208610 6210676 How long's it been<br />since you got any sleep?
6210700 6214386 <i>Twenty-four hours?</i>
6214410 6217766 Hicks, I'm not gonna<br />end up like those others.
6217790 6220630 You'll take care of it, won't you?
6222210 6226760 If it comes to that, I'll do us both.
6228470 6231276 Listen, let's just make<br />sure it doesn't come to that.
6231300 6234946 <i>- All right?<br />- All right.</i>
6234970 6240246 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
6240270 6244256 This is an m-41a<br />pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,
6244280 6248176 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
6248200 6250160 Feel the weight.
6257080 6259370 Okay, what do I do?
6264800 6267526 - Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />- Right.
6267550 6269906 Lean into it.
6269930 6272656 All right. Now, it will kick some.
6272680 6276326 All right. When the counter<br />reads zero here, you
6276350 6278600 - I press this up?<br />- That's right.
6280690 6283916 Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.
6283940 6287046 - Right.<br />- And you're ready to rock and roll.
6287070 6289926 - What's this?<br />- That's the grenade launcher.
6289950 6292756 I don't think you want to mess with that.
6292780 6296846 You started this. Show me everything.
6296870 6298830 I can handle myself.
6300410 6302330 Yeah, I noticed.
6312510 6314526 How do you feel?
6314550 6318060 All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.
6319600 6321866 Look, Ripley, I just want— - forget it.
6321890 6323850 Excuse me.
6378870 6383620 Shh, shh, shh, shh,<br />shh. It's okay. It's okay.
6454360 6457836 Newt, wake up.
6457860 6459846 - Wha—<br />- Be quiet.
6459870 6461870 We're in trouble.
6479390 6481236 No!
6481260 6483930 Move, newt!
6504410 6506330 Hey!
6515340 6519736 Help! Help!
6519760 6521776 - Hicks!<br />- Somebody!
6521800 6523776 <i>Say again, bishop.</i>
6523800 6527246 <i>You've got it into auto-refuel<br />mode, and it's sequencing right?</i>
6527270 6530310 <i>- That's right.<br />- Okay, good. Stay on it.</i>
6531350 6533996 <i>Get back to me when you've<br />activated the launch cycle.</i>
6534020 6537376 - Roger.<br />- He's at the uplink tower.
6537400 6539900 - Good.<br />- Terrific.
6541610 6544676 <i>- Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!<br />- Help!</i>
6544700 6547346 <i>- Help! Help!<br />- Hicks, help us!</i>
6547370 6551516 - Break the glass! Break it. Break it.<br />- Yes.
6551540 6553540 I'll try.
6573810 6576336 <i>Ripley, I'm scared.</i>
6576360 6578360 Me too.
6583820 6585820 Stay here.
6597630 6600736 It's the med lab. Hudson!
6600760 6604156 Vasquez, meet me in<br />med lab. We got a fire.
6604180 6606180 We're on our way.
6609060 6611060 They're coming, newt.
6643630 6645720 Shoot it out!
6649720 6651600 - Hudson!<br />- Jesus.
6655190 6657520 Christ, kid, look out!
6665450 6666450 Fucking die.
6678330 6681606 - Over there! Ready?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
6681630 6683260 <i>Now!</i>
6686760 6688736 - Hudson?<br />- Yeah. All clear.
6688760 6689736 Nailed the other one.
6689760 6691310 It's history, man.
6692720 6694640 Jesus.
6695810 6699400 Burke— it was Burke.
6701650 6704916 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
6704940 6707860 Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
6710820 6714926 He figured that he could get<br />an alien back through quarantine
6714950 6717660 if one of us was impregnated
6718960 6721226 <i>whatever you call it,</i>
6721250 6723896 <i>and then frozen for the trip home.</i>
6723920 6728026 Nobody would know about<br />the embryos we were carrying
6728050 6730090 me and newt.
6731930 6733946 Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
6733970 6736286 Yes. The only way he could do it
6736310 6740126 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
6740150 6742796 Namely yours.
6742820 6746756 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
6746780 6752160 Fuck! He's dead. You're dog meat, pal.
6753160 6755136 This is so nuts.
6755160 6757846 I mean, listen— listen<br />to what you're saying.
6757870 6760596 It's paranoid delusion.
6760620 6765026 <i>It's really sad. It's pathetic.</i>
6765050 6768896 You know, Burke, I don't<br />know which species is worse.
6768920 6772276 You don't see them fucking each<br />other over for a goddamn percentage.
6772300 6775486 All right. We waste him. No offense.
6775510 6777180 No! He's gotta go back
6779350 6782036 - they cut the power.<br />- What do you mean, they cut the power?
6782060 6783706 How could they cut the<br />power, man? They're animals.
6783730 6786376 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!
6786400 6788376 <i>- Gorman, watch Burke!<br />- I got him.</i>
6788400 6790700 Newt, stay close.
6794200 6797290 - I'll go this side.<br />- You do that, man.
6821020 6823876 - Anything?<br />- There's something.
6823900 6827166 It's inside the complex.
6827190 6829190 You're just reading me.
6830150 6832070 No, no, it ain't you.
6834240 6837966 They're inside— inside the<br />perimeter. They're in here.
6837990 6841460 Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?
6848210 6849896 Hudson may be right.
6849920 6853050 - Get back, both of you!<br />- The signal's weird.
6854430 6857156 Must be some<br />interference or something.
6857180 6859156 There's movement all over the place!
6859180 6862576 Get back to operations. It's game time.
6862600 6864980 Newt.
6866520 6869456 Seal the door. Hurry!
6869480 6873006 Come on! Come on!<br />Come on! Get back!
6873030 6874950 Work fast.
6878330 6881556 Cover your eyes, newt.<br />Don't look at the light.
6881580 6884646 Movement. Signal's clean.
6884670 6886646 Range, 20 meters.
6886670 6888896 They found a way in,<br />something we missed.
6888920 6890896 We didn't miss anything.
6890920 6894776 <i>Eighteen. Seventeen meters.</i>
6894800 6897236 Something under the floor,<br />not in the plans. I don't know.
6897260 6899406 - Fifteen meters.<br />- Ripley!
6899430 6902930 - Definitely inside the barricades.<br />- Let's go.
6904560 6906536 - Thirteen meters.<br />- That's right outside the door.
6906560 6909246 - Hicks, vasquez, get back!<br />- This is a big fucking signal.
6909270 6912480 - How you doing, vasquez? Talk to me.<br />- Almost there.
6914110 6916546 That's it.
6916570 6920926 Twelve meters. Eleven.
6920950 6923516 - Ten.<br />- Then they're right on us.
6923540 6926846 <i>- Nine meters.<br />- Remember— short, controlled bursts.</i>
6926870 6928210 Eight meters.
6931210 6933936 Seven.
6933960 6936946 - Six.<br />- It can't be. That's inside the room.
6936970 6940010 - It's reading right, man. Look!<br />- Well, you're not reading it right.
6942600 6947190 <i>Five meters, man. Four. What the hell?</i>
6949860 6953440 - My god. Sh—<br />- Give me the light.
6972040 6974526 There they go! Over there! Get them!
6974550 6979316 Come on! Get them!
6979340 6982736 Do something, gorman!
6982760 6986536 <i>Get them! Look out! There's<br />more of them! There's more of them!</i>
6986560 6990746 Medical! Get to medical! Do it! Now!
6990770 6994916 <i>Hudson, look out! Look out!</i>
6994940 6999240 Now!
7001320 7003556 Burke!
7003580 7006516 Open this door!
7006540 7009330 <i>Burke! Open it!</i>
7011420 7013130 Go! Fall back!
7016300 7018566 <i>Go!</i>
7018590 7021486 - Die, motherfucker!<br />- Burke!
7021510 7025156 <i>Hudson! Hudson!</i>
7025180 7030246 Motherfucker! Come on! Come<br />on! Come and get it, baby! Come on!
7030270 7033996 <i>I don't got all day! Come on!<br />Come on! Come on, you bastard!</i>
7034020 7035730 Come on! You too!<br />You want some of this?
7036860 7039150 Fuck you!
7040110 7042926 Fuck you! Hicks!
7042950 7045580 Hudson!
7053710 7056170 Come on. Let's go!
7056710 7059010 <i>It's locked!</i>
7076270 7079990 <i>- Got it! Let's go! Let's go!<br />- Go! Go!</i>
7082610 7085490 - Move, gorman!<br />- Seal it!
7086530 7090830 Burke! Goddamn you! Open this door!
7099840 7103486 <i>Get back!</i>
7103510 7105866 - Hurry up.<br />- Gorman, get out of the way!
7105890 7108946 - Ripley, this way!<br />- What
7108970 7110906 wait. Get behind me.
7110930 7115020 Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!
7116350 7119190 - Hicks!<br />- Go! Come on. Let's go.
7120860 7122360 Move!
7129330 7131926 Which way is it to the<br />landing field from here?
7131950 7132950 This way.
7137420 7140250 Go right.
7142510 7144470 <i>This way. This way.</i>
7153100 7156626 - Which way?<br />- Straight ahead and left.
7156650 7160296 Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.
7160320 7162256 The ship is on its way.
7162280 7165426 E.t.a., 16 minutes.
7165450 7168240 Stand by there. We're on our way.
7179500 7181526 <i>- Which way now?<br />- That way.</i>
7181550 7184590 - No, wait. This way.<br />- You sure?
7186170 7189050 Vasquez, move!
7191640 7193866 - Right up here. It's just up here.<br />- Hicks!
7193890 7196826 We're almost there.
7196850 7200110 Newt, wait! Newt!
7224130 7226146 Vasquez!
7226170 7228470 Go!
7230640 7233140 No!
7244400 7246796 <i>Newt.</i>
7246820 7250216 Up there. There's a<br />shortcut across the roof.
7250240 7252320 Hicks.
7261750 7263880 You always were an asshole, gorman.
7282270 7284536 <i>- Newt! God!<br />- Ripley!</i>
7284560 7286876 <i>Newt!</i>
7286900 7290030 <i>Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!</i>
7294490 7297016 - Hold on, newt!<br />- I'm slipping!
7297040 7299306 - Don't let go.<br />- Ripley!
7299330 7302370 - Hold on. Gotcha!<br />- Help!
7303380 7305896 I gotcha.
7305920 7308896 Newt!
7308920 7310760 <i>No!</i>
