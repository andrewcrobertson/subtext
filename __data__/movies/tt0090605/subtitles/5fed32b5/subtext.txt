299716 304262 Bio readouts are all in the green.<br />Looks like she's alive.
306765 309768 Well, there goes our salvage, guys.
336211 339339 - How are we today?<br />- Ohh. Terrible.
339422 342300 Well, better than yesterday, at least.
342384 345136 - Where am I?<br />- You're safe.
345220 347639 You're at Gateway Station.<br />Been here a couple of days.
347722 351142 You were pretty groggy at first,<br />but now you're okay.
351226 353728 Oh, looks like you've got a visitor.
355605 357941 Jonesy. Come here.
359109 361236 Hey, come here.
361319 363697 How are you, you stupid cat?
363780 367701 How are you? Where have you been?
367784 371621 Guess you two have met, huh?<br />I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
371705 373373 I work for the company,
373456 376251 but don't let that fool you.<br />I'm really an okay guy.
377544 379462 I'm glad to see you're<br />feeling a little better.
379546 383133 They tell me that all the weakness and<br />disorientation should pass soon.
383216 387596 That's just natural side effects<br />of such an unusually long hypersleep,
387679 389097 or something like that.
389180 391349 What do you mean?
391433 393810 How long was I out there?
393894 395979 <i>Inhalation Therapy, report to...
396062 398315 Has no one discussed this with you yet?
398398 400400 No. But, I mean...
400483 404487 I don't... recognize this place.
404571 406573 No, I know. Uh...
406656 410410 Okay. It's just that,<br />uh, this might be a shock to you.
410493 413079 - It's long...<br />- How long?
413163 415165 Please.
416166 420128 - 57 years.<br />- What?
420211 424466 That's the thing.<br />You were out there for 57 years.
424549 427677 What happened was you had drifted<br />right through the core systems.
427761 430597 And it's really just blind luck...
430680 433892 that a deep-salvage team<br />found you when they did.
433975 436269 It's one in a thousand, really.
436353 438813 I think you're damn lucky<br />to be alive, kiddo.
438897 441066 You could be floating out there forever.
441149 444361 <i>You... You okay?
453620 455872 You okay?
460418 465215 Oh, God!
466633 470220 - Nurse! Please!<br />- God!
470303 473264 Someone get in here now!
473348 475392 Now!
475475 477686 - Hold!<br />- Please.
477769 479980 Hold on!
480063 482065 Kill me!
489739 491574 No!
491658 493660 No!
499457 502585 Bad dreams again?<br />You want something to help you sleep?
502669 504921 No.
505005 507007 I've slept enough.
508967 511177 Jonesy.
511261 513221 Come here.
519728 521730 It's all right.
522731 526526 It's all right now.
526609 528653 It's over.
547881 553845 <i>Dr. Hirsch, 334. Dr. Hirsch, 334.
553928 556389 Hi. Sorry I'm late.<br />I've been running behind all morning.
556473 559267 Is there any word about my daughter?
559350 562771 Uh... I really think we should worry<br />about the hearing now.
562854 564189 ‘Cause we don't have<br />a lot of time, okay?
564272 566232 I read your deposition, and it's great.
566316 569360 If you just stick to that, I think we'll<br />be fine. The thing to remember is,
569444 571404 there're gonna be a lot<br />of heavyweights in there.
571488 573490 You've got feds and Interstellar<br />Commerce Commission,
573573 576659 Colonial Administration,<br />insurance company guys...
576743 579329 Do you have any news about my daughter?
580830 585001 Well, we did come up with some<br />information. Why don't we sit down?
585084 588171 I was hoping to wait<br />until after the inquest.
592258 596262 "Amanda Ripley-McClaren"...<br />married name, I guess...
596346 598515 "Age 66."
598598 600934 And that was at the time of her death,
602644 605313 which was two years ago.
606564 608650 I'm real sorry.
617784 619702 Amy.
622914 624624 She was cremated and interred
624707 627544 at Westlake Repository,<br />Little Chute, Wisconsin.
627627 631005 No children. I checked.
635176 640348 I promised her...<br />that I'd be home for her birthday.
643268 646229 Her 11th birthday.
651234 653361 <i>I'd just like to go, uh...
653444 655655 <i>back to this point about<br /><i>the override destruct order.
655738 659325 - <i>Is it in the file?<br />- I don't understand this.
659409 661703 We have been here<br />for three and a half hours.
661786 664080 Now, how many different ways<br />do you want me to tell the same story?
665540 670128 Look at it from our perspective,<br />please.
670211 672213 Please?
674632 677093 Now, you freely admit to<br />detonating the engines of,
677176 680013 and thereby destroying,<br />an M-class starfreighter,
680096 682557 a rather expensive piece of hardware.
682640 685852 Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
685935 688688 That's minus payload, of course.
688771 690523 The lifeboat's flight recorder
690607 693151 corroborates some elements<br />of your account,
693234 698281 in that, for reasons unknown,<br />the Nostromo set down on LV-426,
698364 702911 an unsurveyed planet at that time,<br />that it resumed its course...
702994 706372 and was subsequently set for<br />self-destruct by you
706456 707916 for reasons unknown.
707999 710376 Not for reasons unknown. I told you.
710460 713671 We set down there on company orders<br />to get this thing,
713755 716174 which destroyed my crew...
716257 718718 and your expensive ship.
718801 722472 The analysis team, which went over the<br />lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,
722555 725683 found no physical evidence<br />of the creature you describe.
725767 729812 Good! That's because I blew it<br />out of the goddamn air lock,
731481 733566 like I said.
735318 739906 Are there any species<br />like this hostile organism on LV-426?
739989 742492 No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.
744494 748081 Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply<br />while I was away?
748164 750541 Ma'am, I already said<br />it was not indigenous.
750625 753378 It was a derelict spacecraft.<br />It was an alien ship.
753461 758049 It was not from there. Do you get it?<br />We homed in on its beacon.
758132 760927 And found something<br />never recorded once...
761010 764514 in over 300 surveyed worlds.
764597 768476 "A creature that gestates<br />inside a living human host."
768559 769394 Yes.
769477 773398 These are your words.<br />"And has concentrated acid for blood."
773481 775733 That's right.
775817 779737 Look. I can see where this is going,
779821 782281 but I'm telling you<br />that those things exist.
782365 784075 Thank you, Officer Ripley.<br />That will be all.
784158 785535 Please. You're not listening to me.
785618 788121 Kane, the crew member...
788204 791958 Kane, who went into that ship,<br />said he saw thousands of eggs there.
792041 794085 - Thousands.<br />- Thank you. That will be all.
794168 796212 Goddamn it, that's not all!
796295 800008 Because if one of those things<br />gets down here, then that will be all!
800091 802635 Then all of this... this bullshit that you<br />think is so important...
802719 806514 You can just kiss all of that good-bye!
812270 814605 It is the finding<br />of this court of inquiry that...
814689 816774 Warrant Officer E. Ripley,
816858 819902 NOC14472,
819986 822739 has acted with questionable judgment...
822822 827243 and is unfit to hold an I.C.C. license<br />as a commercial flight officer.
828995 832415 Said license is hereby<br />suspended indefinitely.
834250 838588 Now, no criminal charges<br />will be filed against you at this time,
838671 840923 and you are released<br />on your own recognizance...
841007 843801 for a six-month period<br />of psychometric probation,
843885 849390 to include monthly review<br />by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.
851184 854061 These proceedings are closed.
865031 867200 That could have been better.
867283 870703 - Look, I think the... Ripley?<br />- Van Leuwen.
870787 874040 Why don't you just check out LV-426?
874123 877919 Because I don't have to. There have been<br />people there for over 20 years,
878002 880922 and they never complained<br />about any hostile organism.
881005 882673 What do you mean? What people?
882757 885885 Terraformers. Planet engineers.
885968 889722 They go in, set up these big atmosphere<br />processors to make the air breathable.
889806 892058 Takes decades.
892141 894393 It's what we call<br />a "Shake 'N Bake" colony.
894477 898105 How many are there? How many colonists?
898189 902693 I don't know...<br />60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?
905363 907365 Families.
909617 911619 Jesus.
986861 989322 - I'll be down in maintenance, okay?<br />- Al!
989405 991365 - What?<br />- Hey, Al.
991449 993618 - What?<br />- Remember you sent some wildcatters...
993701 996537 out to the middle of nowhere last week,<br />out past the Ilium Range?
996621 997455 Yeah, what?
997538 1000499 One of them's on the horn,<br />a mom-and-pop survey team.
1000583 1003336 He says he's onto something. He wants to<br />know if his claim will be honored.
1003419 1005504 Why wouldn't his claim be honored?
1005588 1007590 Well, because you sent them<br />to that particular middle-of-nowhere
1007673 1008674 on company orders, maybe.
1008758 1009634 I don't know.
1009717 1012261 Christ! Some honch in<br />a cushy office on Earth...
1012345 1014472 says, “Go look at a grid reference.”
1014555 1017808 We look.<br />They don't say why, and I don't ask.
1017892 1020811 I don't ask, because it takes<br />two weeks to get an answer out here,
1020895 1021979 and the answer is always...
1022063 1023981 “Don't ask.”
1024065 1026192 So what do I tell this guy?
1026275 1029528 Tell him as far as I'm concerned, if he<br />finds something, it is his.
1029612 1031530 - Lydecker?<br />- What?
1032531 1034200 You kids know you're not<br />supposed to be on this level!
1034283 1036619 Go on! Get outta here!
1068067 1071320 Do too.<br />You go in places we can't fit.
1071404 1073406 So? That's why I'm the best.
1073489 1074365 Knock it off!
1074448 1077076 I catch either of you playing in<br />the air ducts again,
1077159 1078160 I'll tan your hides.
1078244 1080496 Mom, all the kids play...
1080579 1083165 Wait a minute. Annie, come and have<br />a look at this, will ya?
1093884 1096846 Folks, we have scored big this time.
1102935 1105813 What is it, Dad?
1109400 1112403 I'm not sure.
1112486 1114572 Let's see if we can't get<br />a closer look at this thing,
1114655 1116282 maybe through that crack there<br />on the side.
1116365 1117616 Shouldn't we call in?
1117700 1120494 Let's wait till we know<br />what to call it in as.
1124040 1126584 That's about as close<br />as we can get.
1126667 1129754 Should we take a look inside?
1145352 1148606 You two stay inside.<br />I mean it. We'll be right back.
1148689 1150733 - Okay.<br />- Bye.
1226559 1228477 Huh?
1228561 1231689 Timmy, they've been gone a long time.
1231772 1234191 It'll be okay, Newt.<br />Dad knows what he's doing.
1235234 1240072 Mayday, Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo<br />Two Four Niner calling!
1240156 1243159 This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!
1243242 1245536 Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling!
1289205 1291415 Hiya, Ripley.<br />This is Lieutenant Gorman...
1291498 1294627 of the Colonial Marine Corps...
1294710 1296962 Ripley, we have to talk.
1297046 1300758 We've lost contact<br />with the colony on LV-426.
1307223 1309475 I don't believe this.
1309558 1314104 You guys throw me at the wolves, and now<br />you want me to go back out there?
1314188 1316815 Forget it. It's not my problem.
1316899 1320486 - Can I finish?<br />- No. There's no way.
1321904 1323989 Ripley, you wouldn't<br />be going in with the troops.
1324073 1326408 I can guarantee your safety.
1326492 1328994 These Colonial Marines<br />are very tough hombres.
1329078 1331956 They're packing<br />state-of-the-art firepower.
1332039 1333207 There's nothing they can't handle.
1334583 1336919 - Lieutenant, am I right?<br />- That's true.
1337002 1339171 We've been trained<br />to deal with situations like this.
1339255 1342925 Then you don't need me.<br />I'm not a soldier.
1343008 1345594 Yeah, but we don't know<br />exactly what's going on out there.
1345678 1348305 It may just be a downed transmitter,<br />okay?
1348389 1352851 But if it's not,<br />I would like you there as an adviser,
1352935 1354979 and that's all.
1356981 1359817 What's your interest in all this?<br />Why are you going?
1359900 1362945 Corporation cofinanced that colony,
1363028 1365531 along with Colonial Administration.
1365614 1368450 We're getting into a lot of terraforming<br />now. “Building Better Worlds”
1368534 1371036 Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
1371120 1374039 Look, I don't have time<br />for this. I've got to get to work.
1374123 1377251 Oh, right. I heard you're<br />working the cargo docks.
1377334 1379378 That's right.
1379461 1381213 Running loaders and forklifts,<br />that sort of thing?
1381297 1382131 Yeah. So?
1382214 1385384 Nothing. I think it's great<br />that you're keeping busy.
1385467 1387970 And I know it's the only<br />thing that you could get.
1388053 1389888 There's nothing wrong with it.
1393142 1395602 What would you say if I told you I could<br />get you reinstated...
1395686 1397688 as a flight officer?
1397771 1401358 The company's already agreed<br />fo pick up your contract.
1401442 1402234 If I go.
1402317 1405279 Yeah, if you go.
1405362 1407531 Come on. That's a second chance, kiddo.
1407614 1409074 I think, personally, for you,
1409158 1410534 it would be the best thing<br />in the world...
1410617 1413328 to get out there and face this thing,<br />get back on the horse.
1413412 1416373 Spare me, Burke.<br />I've had my psych evaluation this month.
1416457 1417708 Yeah, I know. I've read it.
1417791 1420544 You wake up every night.<br />Your sheets are soaking with sweat...
1420627 1422880 I said no, and I mean it!
1425674 1428552 Now, please leave. I am not going back.
1428635 1431972 And I am... I would not be<br />any good to you if I did.
1432056 1435142 Okay. Shh.
1436560 1440064 Would you do me a favor?<br />Just think about it.
1443150 1445194 Thanks for the coffee.
1513262 1515180 Hello.
1515264 1518016 Ripley.
1518100 1521645 - You okay?<br />- Just tell me one thing, Burke.
1521728 1525023 You're going out there<br />to destroy them, right?
1525107 1530028 Not to study, not to bring back,<br />but to wipe them out.
1530112 1534158 That's the plan. You have my word on it.
1536702 1537911 All right. I'm in.
1539371 1540205 I think that...
1548130 1550424 And you, you little shithead,
1550507 1553343 you're staying here.
1705537 1709374 They ain't payin' us enough<br />for this, man.
1709458 1711543 Not enough to have to wake up<br />to your face, Drake.
1711626 1712461 What?
1713879 1715088 Is that a joke?
1715172 1717257 Oh, I wish it were.
1717340 1722262 Hey, Hicks. Man, you look<br />just like I feel.
1723305 1726224 All right, sweethearts.<br />What are you waiting for?
1726308 1729436 Breakfast in bed?<br />Another glorious day in the corps.
1729519 1733023 A day in the Marine Corps<br />is like a day on the farm...
1733106 1738111 every meal's a banquet, every paycheck a<br />fortune, every formation a parade.
1738195 1739863 - I love the corps!<br />- Christ!
1739946 1741823 Man, this floor is freezing!
1741907 1744409 What do you want me to do?<br />Fetch your slippers for ya?
1744493 1746078 Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.
1746161 1749414 Look into my eye. Fall in, people.
1749498 1751750 Come on. Let's go.
1751833 1753835 I hate this job.
1753919 1755420 Crowe, Wierzbowski.<br />Come on. On your feet.
1755504 1756588 We got some slack coming, right?
1756671 1759549 You had three weeks on your back, Frost.<br />What do you want?
1759633 1762010 I'm talking about breathing,<br />not this frozen shit.
1762094 1764387 Yeah, Top. How ‘bout it?
1767516 1771686 All right. First assembly's<br />in 15, people. Shag It.
1772938 1775565 Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?
1775649 1779111 She's supposed to be<br />some kind of consultant.
1779194 1781446 Apparently, she saw an alien once.
1781530 1784574 Whoopee-fuckin'-do! Hey, I'm impressed.
1784658 1786701 <i>Que bonita!
1789037 1793166 Hey, Vasquez.<br />Have you ever been mistaken for a man?
1793250 1795293 No. Have you?
1795377 1800215 Ha, ha!<br />Oh, Vasquez. You're just too bad.
1811059 1813603 Hey, Top, what's the op?
1813687 1815814 It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.
1815897 1820610 There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br />we have to rescue from their virginity.
1820694 1822863 Dumb-ass colonists.
1825448 1829119 - What's this crap supposed to be?<br />- Vasquez.
1829202 1832289 - Corn bread, I think.<br />- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
1832372 1835375 Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting<br />some more of that Arcturian poontang.
1835458 1837085 Remember that time?
1837169 1840589 Yeah. Except the one<br />that you had was male.
1840672 1843300 Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.
1843383 1844968 Hey, Bishop, man.<br />Do the thing with the knife.
1845051 1845844 Oh, please.
1845927 1848346 Oh, come on. Yeah.
1848430 1850390 All right! Yeah.
1850473 1854060 - I don't want fo see that, man.<br />- Come on, man. All right. All right.
1854144 1857147 Hey, what are you doing, man?<br />What are you doing?
1857230 1859357 - Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.<br />- Hudson, shut up!
1859441 1862027 - Bishop, hey, man.<br />- Do it, Bishop!
1862110 1865697 - Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!<br />- Yeah, you! Don't move.
1865780 1868074 Trust me.
1879794 1882756 All right. Knock it off, knock it off.
1882839 1884841 Thank you.
1887302 1889304 - There you go, short shit.<br />- Enjoy your meal.
1889387 1892140 That wasn't funny, man.
1895685 1898813 - Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1898897 1904069 Looks like the new lieutenant's too good<br />to eat with the rest of us grunts.
1905487 1908657 Boy's definitely got a corncob<br />up his ass.
1909741 1912452 Thought you never miss, Bishop.
1915747 1918541 You never said anything about<br />an android being on board. Why not?
1918625 1922671 It never... never occurred to me.
1922754 1925840 It's just common practice.<br />We always have a synthetic on board.
1925924 1928385 I prefer the term<br />“artificial person” myself.
1928468 1930345 Right.
1930428 1933098 - Is there a problem?<br />- I'm sorry.
1933181 1935100 I don't know why I didn't even...
1935183 1938603 Ripley's last trip out, the syn... the<br />artificial person malfunctioned.
1938687 1939688 Malfunctioned?
1939771 1943566 There were problems<br />and a few deaths were involved.
1943650 1946861 I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
1946945 1949614 The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.
1949698 1952284 That explains it then.<br />The A2s always were a bit twitchy.
1952367 1955078 That could never happen now<br />with our behavioral inhibitors.
1955161 1956705 It is impossible for me to harm,
1956788 1959749 or by omission of action,<br />allow to be harmed, a human being.
1959833 1964045 You sure you don't want some?
1964129 1966715 You just stay away from me,<br />Bishop. You got that straight?
1969509 1972762 Guess she don't like<br />the corn bread, either.
1986192 1989279 Squad, ten-hut!<br />Officer on deck!
1989362 1990322 As you were.
1990405 1993241 Quickly, quickly. Settle down.
1993325 1996328 All right. Listen up!
1996411 1997370 Morning, marines.
1997454 2001499 I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief<br />you people before we left Gateway...
2001583 2004044 - Sir?<br />- What is it, Hicks?
2004127 2007213 Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.
2007297 2010216 What's the question?
2010300 2014095 Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,<br />or another bug hunt?
2014179 2018266 All we know is that there's still no<br />contact with the colony...
2018350 2021227 and that a xenomorph may be involved.
2021311 2024022 - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br />- A xenomorph.
2024105 2026358 It's a bug hunt.
2026441 2031154 - What exactly are we dealing with here?<br />- Ripley.
2031237 2033656 I'll tell you what I know.
2033740 2036159 We set down on LV-426.
2036242 2038536 One of our crew members<br />was brought back on board
2038620 2040246 with something attached to his face,
2040330 2042832 some kind of parasite.
2042916 2045251 We tried to get it off.<br />It wouldn't come off.
2045335 2048254 Later, it seemed to come off<br />by itself and die.
2048338 2050882 Kane seemed fine.
2050965 2053093 We were all having dinner, and, um,
2053176 2057347 it must have laid something<br />inside his throat, some sort of embryo.
2057430 2061393 - He started... Um, he...<br />- Look, man.
2061476 2066564 I only need to know one thing...<br />where they are.
2066648 2069401 - Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2069484 2071403 Right, right. Somebody said “alien.”
2071486 2074364 She thought they said<br />“illegal alien” and signed up.
2074447 2076408 - Fuck you, man.<br />- Anytime, anywhere.
2076491 2079119 Are you finished?
2084290 2087001 I hope you're right. I really do.
2089254 2092298 Yeah, okay, right. Thank you, Ripley.
2092382 2095343 We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br />I suggest you study it.
2095427 2097137 Because just one of those things
2097220 2100306 managed to wipe out my entire crew<br />in less than 24 hours.
2100390 2103143 And if the colonists have found<br />that ship, then there's no telling...
2103226 2104894 how many of them have been exposed.
2104978 2107397 Do you understand?
2109149 2112402 Anyway, we have it on disk,<br />so you better look at it.
2112485 2115155 Any questions?
2115238 2117615 What is it, Private?
2117699 2120702 How do I get out of this<br />chickenshit outfit?
2120785 2122537 You secure that shit, Hudson.
2125206 2127292 All right.
2127375 2130211 Now listen up.
2131588 2133715 I want this thing to go smooth...
2133798 2136342 and by the numbers.
2136426 2140889 I want D.C.S. and tactical database<br />assimilation by 0830.
2141890 2143975 Ordinance loading, weapons strip<br />and drop-ship prep details...
2144058 2146436 - will have seven hours.<br />- Oh, come on.
2146519 2148688 Now, move it, people!
2148771 2149772 All right, sweethearts.
2149856 2151483 You heard the man,<br />and you know the drill.
2151566 2155737 Assholes and elbows!<br />Hudson, come here. Come here.
2171002 2173004 I don't care if you are short, Hudson.<br />Get it done.
2173087 2175673 Hey, Sarge.<br />You'll get lip cancer smoking those.
2175757 2178927 Corporal, I want<br />this loading lock sealed. Now!
2179010 2181429 - How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?<br />- Last one.
2181513 2183556 Good. Take it away.
2200990 2203076 Clear behind.
2209249 2211876 Did you check number three?<br />Let me see that.
2211960 2215880 Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel<br />around here. Is there anything I can do?
2215964 2218341 I don't know.<br />Is there anything you can do?
2221302 2223555 Well, I can drive that loader.
2223638 2227308 I have a Class 2 rating.
2227392 2229477 Be my guest.
2275023 2278943 Where you want it?
2279027 2282405 Bay 12, please.
2338836 2340380 All right, sweethearts.<br />We're a team,
2340463 2342298 and there's nothing to worry about.
2342382 2345927 We come here, and we gonna conquer,<br />and we gonna kick some.
2346010 2348012 Is that understood?<br />That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
2348096 2348888 Yes, sir.
2348971 2351307 - We are going to go and get some.<br />- Hey.
2351391 2354185 All right, people! On the ready line!
2354268 2357063 - Are you lean? Are you mean?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
2357146 2359774 - What are you? What are you?<br />- Lean and mean!
2359857 2362652 Hudson!<br />Get on the ready line, marine!
2362735 2365697 Get some today! Get on the ready line!
2365780 2368700 - Yo!<br />- Move it out! Move it out, goddamn it!
2368783 2372370 Get hot! One, two, three!<br />Get out, get out, get out!
2372453 2375998 Move it out, move it out, move it out!<br />Move it out, move it out, move it out!
2378751 2382380 Absolutely badasses.
2382463 2384882 Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!
2384966 2386968 All right! Move it!
2387051 2389721 - Let's go, let's go!<br />- One, two, three,
2389804 2393266 four, five, six!
2393349 2397729 All right. I want combat seating.<br />You know your places.
2397812 2400106 Get those weapons stowed. Let's go.
2400189 2403526 Come on. Settle down, people.
2403609 2405737 Lock ‘em in, Hudson.
2405820 2409198 - Ready to get it on?<br />- You know it!
2409282 2411951 Okay, Bishop, let's go.
2412034 2414203 Roger.
2415997 2418750 I'm ready, man.
2418833 2422336 Ready to get it on! Go!
2426466 2428926 Stand by. Cross-locking now.
2429010 2430470 Prelaunch autocycle engaged.
2433723 2437727 Primary couplers released.<br />Hit the internals.
2449280 2450114 Shit, man.
2450198 2451991 Confirm cross-lock<br />and drop stations secured.
2452074 2456204 Affirmative. All drop stations secured.
2459874 2462418 Stand by. Ten seconds.
2465046 2469091 Stand by to initiate<br />release sequencer... on my mark.
2469175 2470468 Five, four, three,
2470551 2473846 We're on an express elevator<br />to hell, going down.
2473930 2476891 two, one, mark.
2492698 2494742 Switch to D.C.S. ranging.
2495326 2497078 240, nominal to profile.
2497161 2499872 We're in the pipe, five by five.
2510591 2512760 We're picking up some hull ionization.
2512844 2515304 Got it. Rough air ahead.
2515388 2517640 - We're in for some chop.
2531279 2533614 How many drops is this<br />for you, Lieutenant?
2535950 2538369 Thirty-eight.
2538452 2540413 Simulated.
2540496 2542623 How many combat drops?
2542707 2546752 Uh, two... including this one.
2546836 2550172 - Shit.<br />- Oh, man!
2562852 2567064 Range 014. Turning on final.
2571944 2574822 And I'm telling you,<br />I got a bad feeling about this drop.
2574906 2576240 You always say that, Frost.
2576324 2578326 You always say,<br />“I got a bad feeling about this drop.”
2578409 2580870 Okay, okay.<br />When we get back without you,
2580953 2583956 I'll call your folks.
2586208 2590338 All right. Let's see what we can see.
2590421 2593883 Everybody online. Looking good.
2595718 2598012 Drake, check your camera.<br />There seems to be a malfunction.
2599430 2602683 That's better. Pan it around a bit.
2602767 2605895 - Good.<br />- I'm ready, man. Check it out.
2605978 2607730 I am the ultimate badass.
2607813 2609065 - Yeah.<br />- That's right.
2609148 2613110 State-of-the-badass art.<br />You do not want to fuck with me.
2613194 2614570 Who here's runnin'?
2614654 2617531 Check it out.
2618741 2621494 Hey, Ripley, don't worry.
2621577 2624705 Me and my squad of<br />ultimate badasses will protect you.
2624789 2626707 - Hey!<br />- That's right.
2626791 2628960 Check it out.
2629043 2632588 Independently targeting<br />particle-beam phalanx.
2632672 2636300 Fry half a city with this puppy.
2636384 2638761 We got tactical smart missiles,
2638844 2641263 phase-plasma pulse rifles, R.P.G.'s.
2641347 2642473 We got sonic,
2642556 2644809 electronic ball breakers!
2644892 2648229 We got nukes, we got knives,<br />sharp sticks...
2648312 2651232 Knock it off, Hudson.<br />All right, gear up.
2651315 2655111 Two minutes, people. Get hot.
2655194 2656904 Somebody wake up Hicks.
2670418 2672878 Coming around for a 709er.
2672962 2675840 - Terminal guidance locked in.<br />- Where's the damn beacon?
2675923 2678426 Oh, I see it.
2684598 2687893 - That's the atmosphere processor?<br />- Yep, that's it.
2687977 2691272 Remarkable piece of machinery.<br />Completely automated.
2691355 2693899 You know,<br />we manufacture those, by the way.
2703534 2708748 Okay, Ferro. Take us in low<br />over the main colony complex.
2710458 2712543 Storm shutters are sealed.
2712626 2715212 There's no visible activity.<br />All right. Hold at 40.
2716630 2719467 - Roger.<br />- Give me a slow circle of the complex.
2727349 2731687 Structure seems intact.<br />They still have power.
2731771 2735983 Okay, Ferro.<br />Set down on the landing grid.
2736066 2738944 Immediate dust off on my clear,<br />then stay on station.
2753000 2755336 Down and clear.
2756504 2758672 Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.
2761717 2765054 All right. I want a nice,<br />clean dispersal this time.
2766722 2768808 Let's go! Move it out!
2768891 2770893 Head ‘em up!
2791789 2796001 First squad up on line. Hicks, get yours<br />in accord and watch the rear.
2796085 2799713 Vasquez, take point. Let's move!
2807096 2809056 Move up.
2810933 2814019 Hudson, run a bypass.
2819441 2822361 Second squad, move up.<br />Flanking positions.
2822444 2825155 Second squad on line.
2853183 2855269 You set?
2858314 2860316 Go on.
2885758 2888677 Second team, move inside.<br />Hicks, take the upper level.
2916705 2921710 Sir, you copying this? Looks<br />like hits from small-arms fire.
2921794 2924880 Uh, we got some explosives damage.
2924964 2927216 It's probably seismic survey charges.
2927299 2931095 Are you reading this?<br />Keep it tight, people.
2944358 2948320 All right. Hicks, Hudson,<br />use your motion trackers.
2966130 2969466 Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
2974388 2977224 Quarter and search by twos.
2988652 2991613 Okay. Dietrich, Frost, you're up.
3038786 3040621 It's right in there.
3053008 3053842 - Now!<br />- Now!
3053926 3058722 Good one, Hudson!
3058806 3061975 Uh, sir, uh,<br />we have a negative situation here.
3062059 3063936 Uh, movin' on, sir.
3072986 3075948 Wait. Wait, tell him to...
3076949 3080661 Hicks, back up. Pan right.
3081829 3087417 - There.<br />- You seeing this all right?
3087501 3093048 Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged<br />one of Ripley's bad guys here.
3093131 3095092 Acid for blood.
3095175 3098762 If you like that,<br />you're gonna love this.
3111942 3113652 Quit screwing around.
3113735 3115487 Second squad, what's your status?
3115571 3118699 Uh, we just finished<br />our sweep. Nobody's home.
3118782 3121368 Roger. Sir, this place is dead.
3121451 3124079 Whatever happened here,<br />I think we missed it.
3124162 3125831 All right. The area's secured.
3125914 3128166 Let's go in and see<br />what their computer can tell us.
3128250 3131086 - Wait a minute. It's not secure.<br />- The area's secured, Ripley.
3131169 3132963 First team, head for operations.
3134381 3136383 Hudson, see if you can<br />get their C.P.U. on line.
3136466 3137342 Affirmative.
3137426 3139970 Hicks, meet me at the south lock.<br />We're coming in.
3140053 3140888 Roger.
3140971 3144266 He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
3144349 3146393 Pendejo jerk-off.
3166455 3169082 Sir, we got the C.P.U. on line.
3169166 3170417 No problem.
3170500 3173211 Good. Stand by in Operations.
3174212 3176256 Okay, let's go.
3196610 3198278 Are you all right?
3199488 3201156 Yes.
3217756 3221760 Sir, they sealed off<br />this wing at both ends,
3221843 3225097 welded the doors and blocked off the<br />stairs with heavy equipment.
3226431 3229226 But it looks like<br />the barricade didn't hold.
3229309 3231436 - Any bodies?<br />- No, sir.
3231520 3233438 Last stand.
3233522 3235983 Must have been a hell of a fight.
3236066 3238694 Yeah, looks that way.
3240612 3242739 All right, Drake, this way.
3242823 3245826 We should be able to cut<br />through the medlab fo Operations.
3297627 3299546 Lieutenant.
3301381 3303383 Gorman.
3320275 3321943 Are those the same ones that...
3335207 3337250 Careful, Burke.
3346843 3350764 Looks like love at first sight to me.
3350847 3353183 Oh, he likes you, Burke.
3353266 3355894 Two are alive. The rest are dead.
3357771 3360732 “Surgically removed<br />before embryo implantation.
3360816 3365529 Subject Marachek, John J.,<br />died during the procedure.”
3365612 3367989 They killed him taking it off.
3368240 3372285 Yo, Hicks.
3372369 3374913 I think we got something here.
3379668 3381628 - Behind us.<br />- One of us?
3382921 3386424 Apone, where are your people?<br />Anybody in "D" block?
3386508 3389344 Ah, that's a negative.<br />We're all in Operations.
3392347 3394391 Talk to me, Frosty.
3394474 3396434 Let's keep moving, baby.
3414870 3416830 - It's moving.<br />- Which way?
3416913 3420458 It's coming straight for us.<br />Straight up.
3457996 3459956 - Fuck!<br />- Hold up.
3461541 3463043 Ripley.
3482562 3485690 Hey. Shh. It's all right.
3485774 3488026 - It's all right. Come on.<br />- Just grab her, Corporal.
3488109 3491196 Don't be afraid. Come on.<br />We won't hurt you.
3491279 3493573 Shh. It's all right. It's okay.
3493657 3495825 Come on out. Come on.
3495909 3497994 - Easy. Easy.<br />- I got her.
3498078 3499996 Ow! Damn!
3500080 3502874 - Watch her! She's under the grille!<br />- Don't let her go.
3502958 3506253 - Frost, get your light up here.<br />- Where'd she go?
3509172 3513009 - Shine the light.<br />- Here. Here.
3513093 3514803 - Here. Here.<br />- There she is.
3514886 3517514 Keep back. Keep back. Don't scare her.
3517597 3519349 Grab her, man.<br />We're gonna lose her.
3519432 3520267 Damn it!
3522560 3524479 Kick it out!
3525522 3528692 Wait.
3554342 3557304 It's okay. It's all right.
3558305 3562100 Don't be afraid.
3562183 3564269 See?
3564352 3566271 Wait. No, you don't.
3566354 3569816 It's okay.<br />You're gonna be all right now.
3572068 3576239 Easy. Easy. It's gonna be okay.
3576323 3578825 It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
3581036 3584122 Easy. Easy.
3620116 3622619 - What's her name again?<br />- Rebecca.
3622702 3626664 Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.
3626748 3629584 Just start at the beginning.
3629667 3632712 Where are your parents?
3632796 3635006 Now, look, Rebecca,<br />you have to try and help...
3635090 3637717 Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?
3640053 3642806 Total brain lock.
3642889 3644808 Physically, she's okay.
3644891 3646267 Borderline malnutrition,
3646351 3648103 but I don't think<br />there's any permanent damage.
3648186 3650605 Come on. We're wasting our time.
3660156 3662492 Try this.
3662575 3664911 It's a little hot chocolate.
3666413 3668832 There you go.
3668915 3671126 Whoop.
3671209 3673169 That good, huh?
3677549 3681010 Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.
3681094 3684889 Now I've done it.<br />Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.
3694441 3697986 Hard to believe<br />there's a little girl under all this.
3699988 3702157 And a pretty one too.
3706202 3708788 You don't talk much, do you?
3717797 3719757 Smoking or nonsmoking?
3719841 3721759 Just tell me what<br />you're scanning for, Private.
3721843 3723761 - P.D.Ts.<br />- What?
3723845 3725763 Personal data transmitters.
3725847 3728391 Every colonist had one<br />surgically implanted.
3728475 3731644 If they're within 20 klicks,<br />we'll read it out here.
3731728 3733897 So far, zippo.
3733980 3736900 I don't know how you<br />managed to stay alive,
3736983 3739360 but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
3741362 3743323 N-Newt.
3745325 3748828 - What'd you say?<br />- Newt.
3748912 3751122 My name's Newt.
3751206 3756336 Nobody calls me Rebecca<br />except my brother.
3756419 3760298 Newt? I like that.
3760381 3764177 I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.
3766179 3769307 And who is this, hmm?
3769390 3773102 - Casey.<br />- Hello, Casey.
3773186 3776147 What about your brother?<br />What's his name?
3776231 3778274 Timmy.
3778358 3782820 Is Timmy around here too?<br />Maybe hiding like you were?
3785865 3787825 Any sisters?
3791454 3793373 Mom and dad?
3796209 3800463 Newt, look at me. Where are they?
3800547 3803591 They're dead, all right? Can I go now?
3806719 3809180 I'm sorry, Newt.
3809264 3811849 Don't you think you'd<br />be safer here with us?
3815728 3817772 These people are here to protect you.
3817855 3819816 They're soldiers.
3819899 3822735 It won't make any difference.
3836207 3838251 Need anything else?
3840795 3843756 Hello, Bishop.<br />Do you need anything else?
3845633 3847677 No.
3849762 3851889 That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop.
3851973 3854892 Magnificent, isn't it?
3854976 3860023 Yo! Stop your grinnin'<br />and drop your linen! Found ‘em.
3860106 3862650 - They alive?<br />- Unknown,
3862734 3864652 but it looks like all of them.
3864736 3868906 Over at the processing station,<br />Sublevel 3,
3868990 3871451 under the main cooling towers.
3872660 3875288 Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
3875371 3877290 Let's saddle up, Apone.
3877373 3879667 Aye, sir.
3879751 3882337 All right. Let's go, people.<br />They ain't payin' us by the hour.
3882420 3884380 Let's go. Head 'em out!
3884464 3886382 Okay, Frost, you're driving.
3898269 3901731 It's okay. Don't worry. It'll be okay.
3942271 3944440 I want a straight “V” deployment,
3944524 3946275 second team on left flank.
3946359 3950405 Advance on axial 664. Tracker on line.
3950488 3953616 Set the “V” gain to filter R.F. ambient.
3953700 3957203 Hudson, tracker on line.<br />Left and right, little buddy.
3959038 3963209 Forty meters in, bearing 221,<br />there should be a stairwell.
3963292 3965253 Check. Got it.
3966713 3968631 You want Sublevel 3.
3970842 3973094 Let's go, people.<br />Hudson, you got the point.
3973177 3975555 Hicks, watch our tails.
3975638 3978808 Nice and easy. Check those corners.
3978891 3981144 Check those corners.
3984522 3985732 Watch your spacing.
3985815 3987150 All right.<br />You heard the man.
3987233 3989152 Don't bunch up. Stay loose.
3989235 3991988 Uh, your transmissions<br />showing a lot of breakup.
3992071 3996284 Probably getting some<br />interference from the structure.
3996367 3998494 Use those lights.
3998578 4002957 Next one down, and proceed on a 216.
4003040 4005209 Uh, roger. That's a 216.
4007420 4010423 I'm not making that out too well.<br />What is it, Hudson?
4010506 4013468 You tell me, man. I only work here.
4028566 4030651 What is that?
4030735 4032945 I don't know.
4034655 4036949 Proceed inside.
4052757 4055635 Watch your fire and check your targets.
4055718 4058054 Remember we're looking<br />for civvies in here.
4067855 4069774 Easy.
4069857 4072318 Tighten it up, Frost.<br />We're getting a little thin.
4074111 4076405 Nice and easy.
4078699 4080618 Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
4080701 4084497 Yeah, but secreted from what?
4084580 4087250 Nobody touch nothing.
4087333 4090294 Busy little creatures, huh?
4090378 4092630 Hot as hell in here.
4092713 4094632 Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.
4094715 4096676 Knock it off, Hudson.
4104600 4107937 Lieutenant, what do<br />those pulse rifles fire?
4108020 4110398 Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
4110481 4112441 Standard light armor-piercing round.
4112525 4114777 - Why?<br />- Well, look where your team is.
4114861 4118114 They're right under<br />the primary heat exchangers.
4118197 4120199 So?
4120283 4123995 So if they fire their weapons in there,<br />won't they rupture the cooling system?
4124078 4127290 Ho, ho, ho. Yeah.<br />She's absolutely right.
4127373 4128332 So? So what?
4128416 4132628 Look. This whole station is<br />basically a big fusion reactor.
4132712 4135089 Right?
4135172 4139844 So you're talking about a thermonuclear<br />explosion, and adios, muchachos.
4139927 4142555 Oh, great. Wonderful.
4142638 4145433 Shit!
4147393 4151230 Look. Uh... Apone.
4152565 4155985 Look. We can't have any firing in there.
4156068 4159822 I, uh, I want you to collect<br />magazines from everybody.
4159906 4160907 Is he fuckin' crazy?
4160990 4163951 What the hell are we supposed<br />to use, man, harsh language?
4164035 4166871 - Flame units only. I want rifles slung.<br />- Sir, I...
4166954 4169916 Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.
4171626 4173544 All right, sweethearts.<br />You heard the man.
4173628 4175713 Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.
4176714 4179425 Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.
4182303 4184597 Damn!
4184680 4186807 You too. Give it up, Ski.<br />Come on. Let's go.
4186891 4189852 Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.
4189936 4191896 Right on, Vas.
4193147 4195066 Let's go, marine. Give it up.
4195149 4197276 Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.
4197360 4200237 - Thanks a lot, Sarge.<br />- Hicks, cover our ass.
4200321 4202239 Head ‘em out, people.
4204325 4207912 I like to keep this handy...<br />for close encounters.
4207995 4209872 I heard that.
4218839 4220758 Any movement?
4220841 4223511 Nothing. Zip.
4236232 4238651 Holy shit.
4251455 4253958 Newt, go sit up front.
4254041 4256544 Go on! Now!
4285197 4287950 Steady, people. Let's finish our sweep.
4288034 4291454 We're still marines,<br />and we got a job to do.
4291537 4295249 Keep it moving. Easy.
4327239 4328866 - Help!<br />- What?
4328949 4331702 Top, get over here. We got a live one!<br />You're gonna be all right.
4331786 4334955 Please... k-kill me.
4335039 4337917 Just stay calm.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
4338000 4340586 It's gonna be all right. Give me a hand.<br />We gotta get her outta here.
4340669 4343047 - What is it, Dietrich?<br />- Convulsion!
4343130 4345800 Dietrich, get back!
4345883 4348260 Get back!
4355392 4358687 - No!<br />- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!
4358771 4361398 Get back! Flamethrower! Move!
4391220 4392930 Movement!
4393013 4397768 - What's the position?<br />- I can't lock in!
4397852 4400229 Talk to me, Hudson!
4400312 4403482 Multiple signals.
4403566 4405693 They're closing.
4405776 4409071 Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!
4409155 4412491 What's happening, Apone?<br />Can't see anything in here.
4412575 4414493 Pull your team out, Gorman.
4420332 4423085 I got signals.<br />I got readings in front and behind.
4423169 4425379 Where, man? I don't see shit.
4425462 4427965 He's right. There's nothing back here.
4428048 4430509 Look, I'm telling you. There's<br />something moving, and it ain't us!
4432553 4435556 - Oh, shit.<br />- Tracker's off scale, man.
4435639 4438934 They're all around us, man! Jesus!
4439018 4441937 Maybe they don't show up<br />on infrared at all.
4452198 4454658 Frost!
4458787 4460748 Come on!
4467213 4469798 Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on?
4469882 4472843 Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!
4472927 4476931 - Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off! Frost!<br />- Dietrich, Frost, off the board!
4478349 4479600 Frost!
4481268 4484813 Wierzbowski?
4484897 4487650 Wierzbowski?
4487733 4491403 Let's rock!
4494114 4495741 Who's firing? Goddamn it!
4496742 4497993 Yeah!
4498077 4499495 I ordered to hold fire.
4499578 4502122 They're coming out of the walls!
4502206 4504583 They're coming out of the goddamn walls!<br />Let's book!
4504667 4506877 - On the right, man.<br />- Uh, Apone,
4506961 4509713 I want you to lay down a suppressing<br />fire with the incinerators...
4509797 4512549 Vasquez, Drake,<br />hold your fire, goddamn it!
4512633 4516553 Apone, are you copying me? I want<br />you to lay down suppressing fire...
4516637 4519181 with the incinerators<br />and fall back by squads to the A.P.C.
4519265 4521642 - Over.<br />- Say again, all after “incinerator.”
4521725 4525521 I said I want you to lay down<br />a suppressing fire with the incinerators
4525604 4526438 and fall back...
4526522 4529066 by squads to the A.P.C. Over.
4529984 4531026 Hey!
4532987 4535406 - Sarge! Sarge!<br />- Apone.
4535489 4537908 - Talk to me. Apone?<br />- Copy! Copy!
4537992 4540286 - Talk to me, Apone.<br />- He's gone!
4541954 4544373 - Get them out of there!<br />- Shut up!
4544456 4547376 - Do it now! Hicks, whoever's left, get...<br />- Shut up!
4547459 4549378 - Just shut up!<br />- Goddamn it!
4549461 4553882 - It's coming out of the goddamn walls!<br />- Where's Apone? Where's Apone?
4553966 4556260 The sarge is gone!<br />Let's get the fuck out of here!
4556343 4560139 Let's move it! Let's go, marine!
4560222 4563350 Hudson? Vasquez?
4563434 4566520 - Hudson, look out!<br />- Get it!
4567646 4569648 Watch it!
4569732 4572151 - Hicks.<br />- Come on. Behind you! Fall back!
4572234 4575738 - I told them to fall back.<br />- Fall back, goddamn it, now!
4575821 4577740 - They're cut off!<br />- Hudson, move your ass!
4577823 4579700 - Do something!<br />- Let's go, marine!
4579783 4581744 Fuck!
4581994 4584830 - Come on. Keep moving, baby.<br />- Hold on, Newt.
4590627 4593881 Ripley, what the hell are you doing?
4599803 4601513 Turn around!
4604892 4607269 That's an order!
4610773 4614234 - Get off me, damn it!<br />- Goddamn it that's an order!
4614318 4617029 You had your chance, Gorman.
4628374 4630292 Come on!
4649853 4652481 Come on. Let's move it!
4652564 4654900 Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
4654983 4658445 It's blocked, man.<br />We gotta go around!
4658529 4663325 - Open the door! Hicks!<br />- Drake, we are leaving!
4663409 4665411 Get them, man!
4666286 4668872 Run for it!
4669957 4672418 Shit!
4675170 4678424 - Go! Go!<br />- Come on, man! Come on!
4686515 4690394 Drake, come on!
4692938 4695149 No!
4697234 4700070 - Fire in the hole!<br />- He's gone!
4700154 4702030 Put it out! Put it out! Go! Go!
4702114 4705868 - Come on. Put it out!<br />- Drake's coming, man!
4705951 4708912 - Drake! No, he's not!<br />- He's gone!
4710330 4712291 Forget him! He's gone!
4718130 4720048 They're in the goddamn door!
4723469 4726180 Eat this!
4726263 4729349 Ripley!
4729433 4731768 Go, go, go!
4794540 4796458 It's all right! We're clear!
4796542 4798961 Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
4799044 4800963 You're just grinding metal!
4801046 4803257 Come on, ease down.
4803340 4805384 Ease down.
4805467 4809221 Ease down. Ease down. Ease down.
4820899 4823151 You okay?
4824528 4826572 - I'm all right.<br />- Hudson.
4826655 4828740 Get away from me, man!
4828824 4832828 - Lieutenant.<br />- What happened to Gorman?
4832911 4836164 I don't know. Maybe a concussion.
4836248 4838542 - But he's alive.<br />- He's dead!
4838625 4840711 Wake up, pendejo, and then<br />I'm gonna kill you!
4840794 4844006 Back off. Right now.
4845465 4848635 - Fuck!<br />- Somebody get me a first aid kit.
4848719 4851847 Hey. Hey, look.
4851930 4855225 The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
4855309 4857311 Their signs are real low,<br />but they ain't dead.
4857394 4859688 - Then we go back in there and get them.<br />- Fuck that!
4859771 4862149 - We don't leave our people behind...<br />- I ain't going back in there.
4862232 4864693 You can't help them!
4864776 4869448 You can't. Right now they're being<br />cocooned just like the others.
4873744 4877039 Oh, dear Lord Jesus,<br />this ain't happenin', man.
4877122 4877998 Damn it.
4878081 4881126 This can't be happenin', man.<br />This isn't happenin'!
4881376 4884796 All right. We got<br />seven canisters of CN-20.
4884880 4888216 I say we roll them in there<br />and nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
4888300 4889426 That's worth a try,
4889509 4891094 but we don't even know<br />if it's gonna affect them.
4891178 4893930 Let's just bug out<br />and call it even. Okay?
4894014 4895641 What are we talking about this for?
4895724 4899436 I say we take off<br />and nuke the entire site from orbit.
4902314 4904232 It's the only way to be sure.
4904316 4907569 - Fuckin' “A”!<br />- Hold on. Hold on one second.
4907653 4911823 This installation has a substantial<br />dollar value attached to it.
4911907 4914409 They can bill me.
4914493 4919539 Okay, look. This is an emotional moment<br />for all of us, okay?
4919623 4923043 I know that. But let's not<br />make snap judgments, please.
4923126 4926088 This is clearly... clearly an important<br />species we're dealing with,
4926171 4928924 and I don't think that<br />you or I or anybody has the right...
4929007 4932094 - to arbitrarily exterminate them.<br />- Wrong.
4932177 4933720 Yeah. Watch us.
4933804 4936098 Maybe you haven't been<br />keeping up on current events,
4936181 4938850 but we just got our asses kicked, pal!
4938934 4942270 Look. I'm not blind to what's going on,
4942354 4944940 but I cannot authorize<br />that kind of action.
4945023 4947109 I'm sorry.
4948235 4951154 Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...
4951238 4953198 has authority here.
4954700 4956618 Corporal Hicks is...
4956702 4959079 This operation<br />is under military jurisdiction,
4959162 4961081 and Hicks is next in chain of command.
4961164 4963333 Am I right, Corporal?
4963417 4965377 Yeah.
4966545 4969089 Yeah, that's right.
4969172 4971216 - Yeah. Look, Ripley.<br />- Yes.
4971299 4973760 This is a multimillion-dollar<br />installation, okay?
4973844 4975762 He can't make that kind of decision.
4975846 4978432 He's just a grunt. Uh, no offense.
4978515 4982269 - None taken. Ferro, do you copy?<br />- Standing by.
4982352 4985021 Prep for dust off.<br />We're gonna need immediate evac.
4985105 4987023 Roger. On our way.
4987107 4991737 I say we take off, nuke the site from<br />orbit. It's the only way fo be sure.
4994364 4996074 Let's do it.
5003206 5006752 Let's go.<br />Pick it up, Hudson. Pick it up, baby.
5011965 5014134 All right. Set him down here.
5020724 5022768 Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.
5027939 5029858 Hold on a second. There's something...
5029941 5032235 Just get up here.
5032319 5034821 I'm in. Ramp closing.
5054549 5056510 Spunkmeyer.
5057719 5061389 Goddamn it.
5061473 5063809 Well, where the fuck...
5076571 5078490 Run!
5119364 5123159 Well, that's great.<br />That's just fuckin' great, man.
5123243 5125704 Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
5125787 5128081 We're in some real pretty shit now, man!
5128164 5130542 Are you finished?
5133378 5135338 You all right?
5140552 5144764 I guess we're not gonna<br />be leaving now, right?
5144848 5146474 I'm sorry, Newt.
5146558 5149436 You don't have to be sorry.<br />It wasn't your fault.
5149519 5150478 That's it, man.
5150562 5152939 Game over, man! Game over!
5153023 5155650 What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br />What are we gonna do?
5155734 5158862 Maybe we could build a fire.<br />Sing a couple of songs, huh?
5158945 5160155 Why don't we try that?
5160238 5162991 We'd better get back<br />‘cause it'll be dark soon,
5163074 5166453 and they mostly come at night, mostly.
5183261 5187265 That's everything, right? All right.<br />This is absolutely everything...
5187349 5190352 that we could salvage<br />out of the A.P.C. wreckage.
5190435 5194022 We got four pulse rifles<br />with about 50 rounds each.
5194105 5196232 That ain't so good.
5196316 5200028 We got, uh, 15 of these M-40 grenades.
5200111 5202072 Don't touch that.
5202155 5204616 - Dangerous, honey.<br />- Is that the only flamethrower?
5204699 5208745 Yeah. It's only half full,<br />but it's functional.
5208828 5212582 Got another one, it's damaged...<br />I don't know about that one.
5212666 5218463 But the good news...<br />we got four of these robot sentries,
5218546 5221591 with display and scanners intact.
5221675 5224844 They really kick ass.<br />I think they'll come in handy.
5224928 5229349 How long after we're declared overdue<br />can we expect a rescue?
5231393 5233520 Seventeen days.
5234521 5237065 Seventeen days?
5237148 5239025 Hey, man,<br />I don't wanna rain on your parade,
5239109 5241027 but we're not gonna last 17 hours.
5241111 5243571 Those things are gonna come in<br />here like they did before.
5243655 5244781 They're gonna come in here...
5244864 5245699 Hudson! Hudson!
5245782 5247951 They're gonna come in here<br />and they're gonna get us!
5248034 5250078 This little girl<br />survived longer than that...
5250161 5253206 with no weapons and no training.
5253289 5255208 Right?
5257585 5260296 Why don't you put her in charge?
5260380 5263216 You'd better just start<br />dealing with it, Hudson. Listen to me.
5263299 5265468 Hudson, just deal with it<br />because we need you.
5265552 5267470 And I'm sick of your bullshit.
5267554 5271141 Now, I want you to get on a terminal and<br />call up some kind of floor plan file.
5271224 5273935 Do you understand?<br />Construction blueprints. I don't care.
5274018 5276396 Anything that shows the layout of this<br />place. Are you listening?
5276479 5279566 - Yeah.<br />- I need to see air ducts.
5279649 5283027 I need to see electrical access<br />tunnels, subbasements,
5283111 5286823 every possible way into this complex.
5286906 5291411 - We don't have much time.<br />- Okay.
5291494 5293788 - Okay, I'm on it.<br />- Hudson!
5293872 5298543 Just relax.
5301963 5307010 I'll be in medlab. I'll check on Gorman,<br />continue my analysis.
5307093 5310013 Fine. You do that.
5316227 5320064 So this service tunnel must be how<br />they're moving back and forth.
5320148 5322650 That's right.<br />It moves from the processing station...
5322734 5325069 right into the sublevel here.
5327113 5330450 Come down on that. Okay, come over.
5330533 5333745 Hold. Go back.<br />Okay, punch that in right there.
5339417 5341461 - No. It's back here.<br />- Okay.
5343004 5345673 Well, there's a pressure<br />door at this end.
5345757 5348968 Couldn't we put one of<br />the remote sentry units in the tunnel
5349052 5350386 and then seal that door?
5350470 5353473 Yeah, that'll work, but we gotta<br />figure on them getting into the complex.
5353556 5354808 That's right,
5354891 5358603 So we repair the barricades<br />at these two intersections.
5358686 5359687 Right.
5359771 5361356 And weld plate steel<br />over these ducts...
5361439 5365819 here and here and here.
5365902 5368905 That way they can only come at us<br />from these two corridors.
5368988 5374702 All right. Then we put the other sentry<br />units here and here, right?
5374786 5377247 - Right.<br />- Outstanding.
5377330 5379290 Now all we need is a deck of cards.
5381584 5383711 All right, people.<br />Let's move like we got a purpose.
5383795 5386548 - Affirmative.<br />- Affirmative.
5401813 5405483 Do your thing, baby. Come on, Vasquez.<br />Let's get the hell outta here.
5405567 5408444 Hudson here. “A” and “B” sentries<br />are in place and keyed.
5408528 5413408 Roger. Stand by.<br />Arming now. Test it, Hudson.
5413491 5415869 - Do it!<br />- Fire in the hole!
5419122 5421916 Okay, great.<br />Let's get the hell outta here!
5422000 5425461 We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.
5437640 5439559 For what it's worth.
5441519 5443813 Here. I want you to put this on.
5445189 5447442 - What's it for?<br />- It's a locator.
5447525 5450987 Then I can find you<br />anywhere in the complex on this.
5452822 5456910 - It's just a precaution.<br />- Thanks.
5456993 5459787 Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
5459871 5461873 All right, what's next?
5491486 5493529 Last stop.
5497533 5499452 Get in.
5499535 5503623 Scoot down. That's good.
5503706 5507752 Now, you lie here and have a nap.<br />You're very tired.
5507835 5511214 I don't want to. I have scary dreams.
5513591 5516678 Well, I bet Casey doesn't<br />have scary dreams.
5516761 5518680 Let's take a look.
5518763 5521099 Nope. Nothing bad in there.
5521182 5525478 See? Maybe you could<br />just try to be like her, hmm?
5525561 5528064 Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...
5528147 5531192 because she's just a piece of plastic.
5531275 5534779 Right. I'm sorry, Newt.
5541494 5543746 There.
5543830 5546708 My mommy always said<br />there were no monsters...
5546791 5550128 no real ones... but there are.
5551462 5553423 Yes, there are, aren't there?
5555508 5557844 Why do they tell little kids that?
5559721 5561639 Most of the time it's true.
5561723 5565184 Did one of those things grow inside her?
5565268 5568062 I don't know, Newt.
5568146 5570106 That's the truth.
5570189 5574819 Isn't that how babies come?<br />I mean, people babies?
5574902 5578448 - They grow inside you.<br />- Oh, that's very different.
5578531 5580450 Did you ever have a baby?
5580533 5583870 Yes, I did. I had a little girl.
5583953 5588499 - Where is she?<br />- She's gone.
5590334 5592295 You mean dead.
5593880 5594839 Here.
5596215 5598051 Take this.
5599677 5601512 For luck.
5604724 5606684 There's that.
5608853 5610772 Don't go, please.
5610855 5614400 Newt, I'm gonna be<br />right in the next room.
5614484 5616402 And you see that camera right up there?
5616486 5619280 I can see you right through that camera,
5619363 5621699 all the time to see if you're safe.
5626079 5628748 I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.
5628831 5632752 I mean that. That's a promise.
5632835 5635505 You promise?
5635588 5637882 I cross my heart.
5637965 5642261 - And hope to die?<br />- And hope to die.
5657151 5661614 Now go to sleep, and don't dream.
5665785 5667745 Sneak.
5676546 5679298 The molecular acid oxidizes<br />after the creature's death,
5679382 5680758 completely neutralizing it.
5680842 5682426 Bishop, you know,<br />that's very interesting,
5682510 5684262 but it doesn't really<br />get us anywhere, does it?
5684345 5686889 I'm trying to figure out<br />what we're dealing with here.
5686973 5689058 Let's go through it again.
5689142 5691352 They grab the colonists,<br />they move them over there...
5691435 5695773 and they immobilize them<br />to be hosts for more of these.
5695857 5699694 Which would mean that there would have<br />to be a lot of these parasites, right?
5699777 5701946 One for each colonist.<br />That's over 100, at least.
5702029 5703948 Yes. That follows.
5704031 5708077 But each one of these things<br />comes from an egg, right?
5710621 5712540 So who's laying these eggs?
5712623 5715710 I'm not sure.
5715793 5717753 It must be something<br />we haven't seen yet.
5717837 5720047 Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.
5720131 5722175 Bees, man. Bees have hives.
5722258 5727430 You know what I mean. There's, like, one<br />female that runs the whole show.
5727513 5729891 - Yes, the queen.<br />- Yeah, the mama.
5729974 5732351 She's badass, man. I mean, big.
5732435 5734979 - These things ain't ants, estupido.<br />- I know that.
5735062 5739734 Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br />as soon as you're finished with them.
5739817 5742737 - Is that clear?<br />- Mr. Burke gave instructions...
5742820 5744822 that they were to be kept alive<br />in stasis
5744906 5746657 for return to the company labs.
5748868 5750828 He was very specific about it.
5752288 5754415 Look. Those two specimens<br />are worth millions
5754498 5756250 to the bio-weapons division, right?
5756334 5759712 Now, if you're smart,<br />we can both come out of this heroes,
5759795 5763007 and we will be set up for life.
5764050 5766636 You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?
5766719 5769722 Do you really think you can get<br />a dangerous organism like that
5769805 5770890 past I.C.C. quarantine?
5770973 5773851 How can they impound it<br />if they don't know about it?
5773935 5776979 But they will know about it,<br />Burke, from me.
5777063 5778231 Just like they'll know
5778314 5781317 that you were responsible<br />for the deaths of 157 colonists.
5781400 5783861 - Wait a second.<br />- You sent them to that ship.
5783945 5786030 - You're wrong.<br />- I just checked the colony log.
5786113 5789992 Directive dated 6-12-79,<br />signed Burke, Carter J.
5790076 5793037 You sent them out there,<br />and you didn't even warn them.
5793120 5795539 - Why didn't you warn them, Burke?<br />- Okay, look.
5795623 5798125 What if that ship didn't even exist?<br />Do you ever think about that?
5798209 5801921 I didn't know. So now if I went and made<br />a major security situation out of it,
5802004 5803631 everybody steps in,<br />administration steps in,
5803714 5805383 and there's no exclusive rights<br />for anybody.
5805466 5809512 Nobody wins.<br />So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
5809595 5812348 It was a bad call, Ripley.<br />It was a bad call.
5812431 5814100 - Bad call?<br />- Right.
5814183 5815810 These people are dead, Burke!
5815893 5818312 Don't you have any idea<br />what you've done here?
5818396 5821315 I'm gonna make sure that they nail you<br />right to the wall for this!
5821399 5823651 You're not gonna<br />sleaze your way out of this one.
5823734 5825903 Right to the wall.
5827571 5828572 Ripley.
5830866 5832868 You know, I expected more from you.
5832952 5835913 I thought you'd be smarter than this.
5835997 5839375 Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.
5852972 5854557 What is it? What's going on?
5854640 5856267 - They're coming.<br />- Where?
5856350 5857935 In the tunnel.
5859478 5864942 Here we go. “A” and “B”<br />gun tracking far end. Multiple targets.
5870740 5872616 Those ammo counters go.
5875286 5877413 “B” gun's down 50%.
5878581 5880833 Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.
5884795 5886547 Sixty rounds left on ”B.”
5886630 5889800 Forty. Twenty. Ten.
5889884 5892136 “B” gun's dry. Twenty on “A.”
5893387 5896599 Ten. Five.
5899477 5901145 That's it.
5901228 5904482 Jesus, they were wall-to-wall in there.
5908444 5910446 They're at the pressure door.
5912031 5913991 Man, listen to that.
5914075 5917745 Bishop here.<br />I'm afraid I have some bad news.
5917828 5918829 Well, that's a switch.
5921916 5924710 It's very pretty, Bishop,<br />but what are we looking for?
5924794 5928339 That's it. Emergency venting.
5928422 5933094 Oh, that's beautiful, man.<br />Oh, man, that... that just beats it all.
5933177 5936055 - How long till it blows?<br />- Four hours.
5936138 5939183 With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
5939266 5942937 equal to about 40 megatons.
5943020 5943813 We got problems.
5943896 5946482 I don't believe this.<br />I don't fucking believe this.
5946565 5949068 Vasquez, close the shutters.
5949151 5951320 Why can't we shut it down from here?
5951403 5953322 I'm sorry.<br />The crash caused too much damage.
5953405 5955950 An overload is inevitable at this point.
5956033 5958953 Oh, man, and I was getting short.
5959036 5962414 Four more weeks and out.<br />Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
5962498 5964542 - It ain't half fair, man.<br />- Hudson, give us a break!
5964625 5967211 Four more weeks. Oh, man.
5967294 5970506 We've got to get the other<br />drop ship from the Sulaco.
5970589 5973551 I mean, there must be some way<br />of bringing it down on remote.
5973634 5977179 How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C.<br />It's wasted.
5977263 5979890 I don't care how,<br />but we'd better think of something.
5979974 5981100 We'd better think of a way.
5981183 5982518 Think of what?<br />We're fucked! We're doomed!
5982601 5983435 Shut up!
5983519 5986313 Shut up! What about<br />the colony transmitters?
5986397 5989191 The uplink tower down at the other end.<br />Why can't we use that?
5989275 5992236 No, I checked. The hardware in between<br />here and there was damaged.
5992319 5994238 We can't align the dish.
5994321 5996740 Well, somebody's gonna<br />have to go out there,
5996824 5999743 take a portable terminal,<br />go out there and patch in manually.
5999827 6004915 Oh, yeah, sure. With those things<br />running around? You can count me out.
6004999 6006125 Guess we can just<br />count you out of everything.
6006208 6007042 I'll go.
6007126 6008919 That's right, man.<br />Why don't you go, man?
6009003 6010838 - I'll go.<br />- What?
6010921 6012006 I'll go.
6012506 6015259 I mean, I'm the only one qualified<br />to remote pilot the ship anyway.
6015342 6019722 Yeah, right, man.<br />Bishop should go. Good idea.
6019805 6021974 Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
6022057 6024977 I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
6036739 6038657 How long?
6038741 6042036 This conduit runs almost<br />to the uplink assembly... 180 meters.
6042119 6045414 - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...<br />- Right.
6045497 6049251 An hour to patch in<br />and align the antenna.
6050336 6052630 Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
6052713 6055925 - and about 50 minutes flight time.<br />- It's gonna be close.
6060429 6063140 - Good luck.<br />- See you soon.
6064600 6068395 Watch your fingers.
6069396 6070773 Vaya con Dios, man.
6084578 6089208 This is unbelievable.<br />Twenty meters and closing.
6089291 6091377 - Fifteen.<br />- How many?
6091460 6094046 Can't tell. Lots.
6095631 6098884 “D” gun's down 50%.
6100928 6104056 “C” gun's right behind it.
6106016 6109186 Stopping them. It ain't stopping them.
6109270 6114275 - 150 rounds on ”D.”<br />- Come on. Come on, baby.
6114358 6116652 Hundred rounds.
6116735 6119405 Come on! Come on!
6124410 6125911 “D” gun's down to 20.
6127162 6129581 Ten.
6130833 6132251 Damn it!
6133877 6136880 Wait! They're retreating.
6142136 6144847 The guns stopped them.
6146724 6148684 You're right.
6156066 6157985 Next time they walk right up and knock.
6158068 6160029 Yeah, but they don't know that.
6160112 6162865 They're probably looking<br />for other ways to get in.
6163907 6165826 That'll take 'em a while.
6165909 6168412 - Maybe we got 'em demoralized.<br />- Shut up!
6169747 6172207 I want you two walking perimeter.
6173792 6176378 Move!
6182593 6184803 Hey, listen.
6184887 6187806 We're all in strung-out shape,
6187890 6191185 but stay frosty and alert.
6192603 6195481 We can't afford to let<br />one of those bastards in here.
6195564 6197733 All right. Vamonos.
6208619 6210621 How long's it been<br />since you got any sleep?
6210704 6214333 Twenty-four hours?
6214416 6217711 Hicks, I'm not gonna end up<br />like those others.
6217795 6220631 You'll take care of it, won't you?
6222216 6226762 If it comes to that, I'll do us both.
6228472 6231225 Listen, let's just make sure<br />it doesn't come to that.
6231308 6234895 - All right?<br />- All right.
6234978 6240192 Hey, I want to introduce you<br />to a personal friend of mine.
6240275 6244196 This is an M-41A<br />pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,
6244279 6248117 with an over-and-under 30 millimeter<br />pump-action grenade launcher.
6248200 6250160 Feel the weight.
6257084 6259378 Okay, what do I do?
6264800 6267469 - Okay, pull it in tight here.<br />- Right.
6267553 6269847 Uh-huh. Lean into it.
6269930 6272599 All right. Now, it will kick some.
6272683 6276270 All right.<br />When the counter reads zero here, you...
6276353 6278605 - I press this up?<br />- That's right.
6280691 6283861 Get another one in quick.<br />Slap it in hard.
6283944 6286989 - Right.<br />- And you're ready to rock and roll.
6287072 6289867 - What's this?<br />- That's the grenade launcher.
6289950 6292703 I don't think you want<br />to mess with that.
6292786 6296790 You started this. Show me everything.
6296874 6298834 I can handle myself.
6300419 6302337 Yeah, I noticed.
6312514 6314475 How do you feel?
6314558 6318061 All right, I guess.<br />One hell of a hangover.
6319605 6321815 - Look, Ripley, I just want...<br />- Forget it.
6321899 6323859 Excuse me.
6378872 6383627 It's okay. It's okay.
6454364 6457784 Newt, wake up.
6457868 6459786 - Wha...<br />- Be quiet.
6459870 6461872 We're in trouble.
6479389 6481183 No!
6481266 6483935 Move, Newt!
6504414 6506333 Hey!
6515342 6519680 Help! Help!
6519763 6521723 - Hicks!<br />- Somebody!
6521807 6523725 Say again, Bishop.
6523809 6527187 You've got it into auto-refuel mode,<br />and it's sequencing right?
6527270 6530315 - That's right.<br />- Okay, good. Stay on it.
6531358 6533944 Get back to me when you've<br />activated the launch cycle.
6534027 6537322 - Roger.<br />- He's at the uplink tower.
6537406 6539908 - Good.<br />- Terrific.
6541618 6544621 - Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!<br />- Help!
6544705 6547290 - Help! Help!<br />- Hicks, help us!
6547374 6551461 - Break the glass! Break it. Break it.<br />- Yes.
6551545 6553547 I'll try.
6573817 6576278 Ripley, I'm scared.
6576361 6578363 Me too.
6583827 6585829 Stay here.
6597632 6600677 It's the medlab. Hudson!
6600761 6604097 Vasquez, meet me in medlab.<br />We got a fire.
6604181 6606183 We're on our way.
6609060 6611062 They're coming, Newt.
6643637 6645722 Shoot it out!
6649726 6651603 - Hudson!<br />- Jesus.
6655190 6657526 Christ, kid, look out!
6665450 6666451 Fucking die.
6678338 6681550 - Over there! Ready?<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
6681633 6683260 Now!
6686763 6688682 - Hudson?<br />- Yeah. All clear.
6688765 6689683 Nailed the other one.
6689766 6691309 It's history, man.
6692727 6694646 Jesus.
6695814 6699401 Burke...<br />It was Burke.
6701653 6704865 I say we grease this rat-fuck<br />son of a bitch right now.
6704948 6707868 Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
6710829 6714875 He figured that he could get an alien<br />back through quarantine...
6714958 6717669 if one of us was impregnated
6718962 6721172 whatever you call it...
6721256 6723842 and then frozen for the trip home.
6723925 6727971 Nobody would know<br />about the embryos we were carrying...
6728054 6730098 me and Newt.
6731933 6733894 Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
6733977 6736229 Yes. The only way he could do it...
6736313 6740066 is if he sabotaged certain<br />freezers on the way home.
6740150 6742736 Namely yours.
6742819 6746698 Then he could jettison the bodies<br />and make up any story he liked.
6746781 6752162 Fuck! He's dead. You're dog meat, pal.
6753163 6755081 This is so nuts.
6755165 6757792 I mean, listen...<br />Listen to what you're saying.
6757876 6760545 I's paranoid delusion.
6760629 6764966 Its really sad. It's pathetic.
6765050 6768845 You know, Burke, I don't know<br />which species is worse.
6768929 6772223 You don't see them fucking each other<br />over for a goddamn percentage.
6772307 6775435 All right. We waste him. No offense.
6775518 6777187 No! He's gotta go back...
6779356 6781983 - They cut the power.<br />- What do you mean, they cut the power?
6782067 6783652 How could they cut the power, man?<br />They're animals.
6783735 6786321 I want you two with trackers,<br />checking the corridors! Move!
6786404 6788323 - Gorman, watch Burke!<br />- I got him.
6788406 6790700 Newt, stay close.
6794204 6797290 - I'll go this side.<br />- You do that, man.
6821022 6823817 - Anything?<br />- There's something.
6823900 6827112 It's inside the complex.
6827195 6829197 You're just reading me.
6830156 6832075 No, no, it ain't you.
6834244 6837914 They're inside...<br />inside the perimeter. They're in here.
6837998 6841459 Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?
6848216 6849843 Hudson may be right.
6849926 6853054 - Get back, both of you!<br />- The signal's weird.
6854431 6857100 Must be some interference or something.
6857183 6859102 There's movement all over the place!
6859185 6862522 Get back to Operations. It's game time.
6862605 6864983 Newt.
6866526 6869404 Seal the door. Hurry!
6869487 6872949 Come on! Come on! Come on! Get back!
6873033 6874951 Work fast.
6878329 6881499 Cover your eyes, Newt.<br />Don't look at the light.
6881583 6884586 Movement. Signal's clean.
6884669 6886588 Range, 20 meters.
6886671 6888840 They found a way in,<br />something we missed.
6888923 6890842 We didn't miss anything.
6890925 6894721 Eighteen. Seventeen meters.
6894804 6897182 Something under the floor,<br />not in the plans. I don't know.
6897265 6899350 - Fifteen meters.<br />- Ripley!
6899434 6902937 - Definitely inside the barricades.<br />- Let's go.
6904564 6906483 - Thirteen meters.<br />- That's right outside the door.
6906566 6909194 - Hicks, Vasquez, get back!<br />- This is a big fucking signal.
6909277 6912489 - How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me.<br />- Almost there.
6914115 6916493 That's it.
6916576 6920872 Twelve meters. Eleven.
6920955 6923458 - Ten.<br />- Then they're right on us.
6923541 6926795 - Nine meters.<br />- Remember... short, controlled bursts.
6926878 6928213 Eight meters.
6931216 6933885 Seven.
6933968 6936888 - Six.<br />- It can't be. That's inside the room.
6936971 6940016 - It's reading right, man. Look!<br />- Well, you're not reading it right.
6942602 6947190 Five meters, man. Four. What the hell?
6949859 6953446 - Oh, my God. Oh, sh...<br />- Give me the light.
6972048 6974467 There they go! Over there! Get them!
6974551 6979264 Come on! Get them!
6979347 6982684 Do something, Gorman!
6982767 6986479 Get them! Look out! There's<br />more of them! There's more of them!
6986563 6990692 Medical!<br />Get to Medical! Do it! Now!
6990775 6994863 Hudson, look out! Look out!
6994946 6999242 Now!
7001327 7003496 Burke!
7003580 7006457 Open this door!
7006541 7009335 Burke! Open it!
7011421 7013131 Go! Fall back!
7016301 7018511 Go!
7018595 7021431 - Die, motherfucker!<br />- Burke!
7021514 7025101 Hudson! Hudson!
7025185 7030190 Motherfucker! Come on!<br />Come on! Come and get it, baby! Come on!
7030273 7033943 I don't got all day!<br />Come on! Come on! Come on, you bastard!
7034027 7035737 Come on! You too!<br />Oh, you want some of this?
7036863 7039157 Fuck you!
7040116 7042869 Fuck you! Hicks!
7042952 7045580 Hudson!
7053713 7056174 Come on. Let's go!
7056716 7059010 It's locked!
7076277 7079989 - Got it! Let's go! Let's go!<br />- Go! Go!
7082617 7085495 - Move, Gorman!<br />- Seal it!
7086537 7090833 Burke! Goddamn you! Open this door!
7099842 7103429 Get back!
7103513 7105807 - Hurry up.<br />- Gorman, get out of the way!
7105890 7108893 - Ripley, this way!<br />- What...
7108977 7110853 Wait. Get behind me.
7110937 7115024 Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!
7116359 7119195 - Hicks!<br />- Go! Come on. Let's go.
7120863 7122365 Move!
7129330 7131874 Which way is it to<br />the landing field from here?
7131958 7132834 This way.
7137422 7140258 Go right.
7142510 7144470 This way. This way.
7153104 7156566 - Which way?<br />- Straight ahead and left.
7156649 7160236 Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.
7160320 7162196 The ship is on its way.
7162280 7165366 E.T.A., 16 minutes.
7165450 7168244 Stand by there. We're on our way.
7179505 7181466 - Which way now?<br />- That way.
7181549 7184594 - No, wait. This way.<br />- You sure?
7186179 7189057 Vasquez, move!
7191642 7193811 - Right up here. It's just up here.<br />- Hicks!
7193895 7196773 We're almost there.
7196856 7200109 Newt, wait! Newt!
7224133 7226094 Vasquez!
7226177 7228471 Go!
7230640 7233142 Oh, no!
7244404 7246739 Newt.
7246823 7250159 Up there. There's a shortcut<br />across the roof.
7250243 7252328 Hicks.
7261754 7263881 You always were an asshole, Gorman.
7282275 7284485 - Newt! God!<br />- Ripley!
7284569 7286821 Newt!
7286904 7290032 Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!
7294495 7296956 - Hold on, Newt!<br />- I'm slipping!
7297039 7299250 - Don't let go.<br />- Ripley!
7299333 7302378 - Hold on. Gotcha!<br />- Help!
7303379 7305840 I gotcha.
7305923 7308843 Newt!
7308926 7310761 No!
7314140 7316976 Come on. We can find her with this.
7317059 7320771 - Stay where you are, Newt.<br />- Ripley!
7320855 7323941 We're coming.
7333159 7335161 Ripley!
7337622 7341334 This way.
7342919 7346255 - She's close.<br />- Newt!
7348925 7350843 Ripley!
7350927 7353387 Where are you? Can you hear me?
7354764 7356682 - Newt!<br />- Here!
7356766 7358976 - I'm here!<br />- Where?
7363022 7366067 Newt, are you okay?
7366150 7368945 We'll have to cut it.
7369028 7372448 Climb down, honey.<br />We've gotta cut through.
7379664 7381582 Newt?
7381666 7384961 Now, don't move. Stay very still.
7385044 7387046 Okay.
7387129 7389799 We're almost there. Hang in there, okay?
7396973 7398766 - Hicks. Hurry.<br />- I know.
7398849 7401310 - I know!<br />- I mean it!
7414949 7417868 Newt? Newt, just stay still.
7421080 7423291 Almost there.
7423374 7425042 No!
7426502 7428588 Newt!
7438389 7441934 No! No!
7442018 7444145 - No! No! No!<br />- Let's go.
7444228 7446439 No! No! They don't kill you!
