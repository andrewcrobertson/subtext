43302 44636 Creed doesn't know where he is.
44720 46304 It's blind instinct.
48182 50099 But now it is<br />Creed coming back.
50184 51517 Creed with the left hand!
51602 53311 What's keeping<br />these two guys up?
53395 55188 A tremendous closing moment.
58859 62362 Here comes Balboa back. But the<br />champion back with another left.
67076 68826 How they're getting up,<br />I don't know!
68911 70662 A right hand!<br />A right hand!
70746 72497 It's Creed!<br />Now it's Balboa!
72581 73665 Now it's Creed!
73749 75625 And now a tremendous<br />left by Rocky.
75709 78086 They're standing dead in the<br />center of the ring, toe-to-toe.
96356 97481 One.
100610 101652 Two.
101736 103654 Creed<br />will retain the title.
103738 107866 If neither gets up, it's a draw,<br />and Creed will win the title.
107951 109076 Four.
109160 110703 Get up, my man.
110787 111870 Five.
112163 113330 Get up.
113415 114498 Six.
114791 117209 Each fighter<br />is trying to beat the count.
117293 118752 Get up, Rocky!
119295 120462 Eight.
122132 123215 Nine.
123299 124800 The champ is down!
124884 125968 Ten!
126970 128345 You're out!
131141 133225 Balboa got to his<br />feet and he made it!
133309 135561 Rocky Balboa has<br />shocked the world!
135645 137980 He is the new heavyweight<br />champion of the world!
139941 142192 Ladies and gentlemen,

147282 150868 the new heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
152120 155706 Rocky Balboa!
156916 159084 Excuse me.<br />Excuse me.
160044 164507 I just want to say one<br />thing to my wife, who's home.
166927 169596 Yo, Adrian, I did it!
169680 172891 I love you.<br />I love you.
174935 181191 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
207051 208802 Hit him one, Rocky!
233244 236579 Risin' up,<br />back on the street
237706 240835 Did my time,<br />took my chances
242045 245339 Went the distance,<br />now I'm back on my feet
245423 249134 Just a man and<br />his will to survive
250428 254139 So many times,<br />it happens too fast
254933 257560 You change your<br />passion for glory
259271 262940 Don't lose your grip<br />on the dreams of the past
263024 266819 You must fight<br />just to keep them alive
267237 271532 It's the eye of the tiger,<br />it's the thrill of the fight
271616 275744 Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
276037 280207 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
280458 287214 And he's watchin' us all<br />in the eye of the tiger
290677 294054 Face to face,<br />out in the heat
295098 297975 Hangin' tough,<br />stayin' hungry
299227 302730 They stack the odds<br />till we take to the street
302814 306525 For we kill with<br />the skill to survive
306902 311238 It's the eye of the tiger,<br />it's the cream of the fight
311323 315492 Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
315785 320123 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
320207 324711 And he's watchin'<br />us all in the eye
324795 327923 Of the tiger
335973 339100 Risin' up,<br />straight to the top
339185 341937 Have the guts,<br />got the glory
343940 346775 Went the distance,<br />now I'm not gonna stop
346859 350987 Just a man and<br />his will to survive
351197 355367 It's the eye of the tiger,<br />it's the cream of the fight
355451 359746 Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
359830 364125 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
364210 369839 And he's watchin'<br />us all in the eye
371050 374302 Of the tiger
383854 385981 The eye of the tiger
392363 395323 The eye of the tiger.
396450 399662 I want Balboa!<br />I want Balboa!
399746 402456 Hear that, old man? You tell<br />Balboa I'm coming for him!
402541 404875 Nobody can beat me!<br />You tell him what I said!
404960 406836 And he's next!<br />I'm gonna kill him!
406920 409547 Nobody can stop me!<br />You tell Balboa that!
409631 411716 I'm coming after him!<br />You tell him!
411883 412967 I want a shot<br />at the title.
413051 415302 If Balboa's got the guts<br />to meet me in the ring,
415387 416429 or anywhere else.
416513 419598 My whole life's been directed towards<br />this here title and nothing else.
419683 421559 I live alone<br />and I train alone.
421643 423811 I'll win the title<br />alone. I want him.
423895 425521 He can't duck me forever.
425605 427481 He can run,<br />but he can't hide.
427566 430860 Well, another southpaw,<br />heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa,
430944 433070 doesn't seem to be worried<br />about much these days.
433155 435364 He's just defended his<br />title for the 10th time,
435449 436991 and now he's even<br />agreed to take on
437075 438868 the world heavyweight<br />wrestling champion
438952 441412 in a sort of charity<br />benefit, with all the proceeds
441496 443205 to go to a local<br />youth foundation.
443290 445166 Now, I'll have to<br />give him credit.
445250 447209 Mr. Balboa manages<br />to stay busy.
447294 448544 He's a true sportsman.
448628 451130 And it looks like the number<br />one contender, Clubber Lang,
451214 453215 will have to continue to<br />play the waiting game.
453300 455843 But that should be<br />a great, great matchup.
455927 458304 Hey, Paulie,<br />take it easy, okay?
458680 461348 Awesome.<br />Introducing the newest...
461433 463392 Hey, you going?
463477 466687 Hey, hey. Don't forget to<br />give Rocky my best, huh?
467147 469774 You know, I've been<br />coming here years.
470317 474361 How about you giving me,<br />Paulie, your best once?
475155 476906 Take it easy, Paul.
478034 479576 Hey, hey, Paulie.
479660 481453 Hey, Paulie,<br />you heard me?
481537 485373 Hey, when you see the Rock, tell<br />him the boys all said, "Hey!"
526374 527916 40 thousand.
532463 534214 Nice try.<br />Nice try.
535341 537008 I got another one.
592608 593774 Paulie.
598739 600323 You want to hear<br />I owe you?
600407 601699 You, I owe nothing.
601783 604076 No, you don't<br />owe me nothing.
604161 606287 So what do you<br />want I should do?
606371 607622 My sister ain't here?
607706 608831 She's home.
608916 612627 You know, me and her used to<br />be tight until you come in.
612711 615254 I raise her,<br />she don't come down.
615339 617673 She don't know<br />about this.
617758 619675 You and her can go to hell, you know that?
619760 622220 Hey, watch your<br />mouth, Paulie.
622304 624555 You gonna whack me?<br />I don't sweat you.
624640 626224 I don't sweat you.<br />Come on.
626308 628476 Oh, come on, Paul, why don't<br />you screw your head on right.
628560 630186 No, it ain't my head.
630270 632521 Your freaking head is<br />the one on wrong.
632606 635067 Yeah? Well,<br />what did I do?
635151 636860 What'd you do?<br />Nothing.
636945 638570 For yourself,<br />oh, nice.
638655 640739 Look, you fixed<br />your face up handsome.
640823 641907 Nice clothes.
641991 643825 What did you do for<br />Paulie? Anything?
643910 645911 Three years, did you get me a job?
645995 650499 Look at this. You gave me a<br />lousy, stinking Ex-Lax watch. This!
651376 652417 Hey, Paulie.
652502 653543 What?
653628 655504 What? There,<br />that's right.
655588 657256 No, leave it down!
657340 659633 It never kept<br />good time anyway.
660843 662094 You know, you forget<br />when you were a punk
662178 664763 and those guys used to laugh<br />at you because you were so jive.
664847 666765 Who used to whack<br />them bums out?
666849 668642 They laughed<br />at both of us.
668726 670352 No one laughed at me.
671354 673355 Tell me. Who fixed you<br />up with your first woman?
673439 675357 Me, Paulie!<br />I was responsible!
675441 677276 She was pregnant.
677360 680362 So what? You was<br />no prize either.
681030 683448 You know, I always<br />give you. I give you.
683533 687411 What do you do? You buy a new<br />house, you move Mick in, right?
687495 690914 Did you ask me? Is there<br />something the matter with me?
692083 693709 I got feelings, you know?<br />This ain't cardboard.
695044 697212 Everybody's got<br />them, Paulie.
697588 699214 The hell with everybody.
699299 701216 No, maybe it's<br />the hell with you.
702051 703719 I don't wanna listen<br />to this crap.
703803 705554 Come on, you talk like<br />everybody owes you a living.
705638 706638 Shut your mouth!
706723 709891 Look, nobody owes nobody<br />nothing. You owe yourself.
709976 711351 You're wrong!<br />Friends owe!
711436 712978 Friends don't owe.
713062 714856 They do because<br />they want to do.
714940 717567 Shut your freaking mouth.<br />You been keeping me down!
717651 718735 Down?
719903 723114 You know, you're like a crazy<br />brother to me. You really are.
723198 724866 So I want to tell you<br />something. This is coming
724950 726159 straight from<br />the heart, Paulie.
726243 727827 And I mean this.
727911 731080 You ain't down,<br />and you ain't a loser.
731832 735501 You're just<br />a jealous, lazy bum.
736670 739172 Okay, I'm gonna<br />break your mouth.
739590 741799 I'm gonna bust<br />your mouth up!
752978 754604 Can I have a job?
757941 759984 All you had<br />to do was ask.
765407 767200 You punch pretty good.
767284 769160 Think so?<br />Superb.
771955 773289 It cost a lot, huh?
773374 774665 Yeah, a few bucks.
775125 776751 Got an extra one?
780005 781631 Any trouble<br />with Paulie tonight?
781715 783466 Nah,<br />nothing unusual.
784134 786636 Are you really gonna fight<br />that wrestler? They're so big.
786720 789013 That's all right,<br />it'll be fun.
789807 792308 You mind if I serenade you a while?
794145 796063 Come on, it's your part.<br />What are you doing?
796147 797272 Come on.<br />You can do it.
797357 798440 No.
799818 801318 Come on, Rocky, you're gonna wake the baby.
801403 803779 Adrian, come on,<br />let's do a duet.
807492 810494 No, no. That's good,<br />but it's not "doe, doe."
810578 813330 It's "doo, doo,<br />doo, doo."
815792 817000 That's good, darling.
817085 819336 I've been told
822132 825134 By people and they all
827011 828887 Say they'd take me back
828972 831515 Take me back like before
835311 836770 What's the matter?
836855 839022 I don't know any more<br />of that composition.
839107 840441 Hmm.
840525 841608 Maybe we're lucky.
841693 843235 Yeah. Maybe<br />we're very lucky.
843319 844695 Very lucky.<br />Hmm.
852203 853704 Well, howdy,<br />howdy, howdy, sports fans.
853788 856790 This is Dennis James with Jim<br />Healy down here at ringside.
856875 859126 Tonight we have a most unlikely<br />match for you.
859210 861170 The boxer against<br />the wrestler,
861254 863589 with all the proceeds<br />going to charity.
863673 865007 What's your feelings<br />about a boxer
865091 866341 against a wrestler<br />in the same ring?
866426 869636 Well, you know what the age-old<br />theory is, that the wrestler,
869721 871848 once he grabs that boxer,<br />that's all she wrote.
871932 874392 What the hell goes<br />on inside your head?
874477 875894 Anything normal<br />functions?
876061 877479 Yeah, there's a few,<br />there's a few.
877563 880148 I don't think so. Because to<br />fight a creature like this,
880232 882859 you gotta have about 100<br />pounds of brain damage.
882943 885778 I seen wrestlers that<br />was bigger than dinosaurs.
885905 888323 You ever fight a dinosaur,<br />kid? No, not lately.
888407 890783 They can cause<br />a variety of damage.
890868 891993 Oh, yeah?
892077 894829 The wrestling champion of the<br />world is now entering the arena.
894914 896664 I tell you, he is quite a sight.
896749 898666 All decked out in red.
898751 900293 Why are they<br />carrying him?
900377 901753 He's walking.
908052 910428 I'm coming after<br />you, Balboa.
911138 912347 Let's call it off.
912431 913848 Oh, come on,<br />it's for charity.
913933 916017 You're wearing your anatomy out for charity.
916101 918686 Nobody else does<br />this much for charity.
918771 920396 Bob Hope would.
920481 921814 That's true.
927154 929531 Rocky, you better<br />call Bob Hope.
937248 939666 To all my love<br />slaves out there,
940584 944837 Thunderlips is here<br />in the flesh, baby!
944922 946297 Oh, my God!
946799 951804 The ultimate male versus<br />the ultimate meatball.
953598 955391 Boy, he is a monster.
955475 958227 How much would you take even<br />to get in the ring with him?
958311 960271 Would you like to start at Fort Knox?
960355 963691 In the white corner,<br />an incredible sight.
964985 967152 Standing nearly seven feet,
968363 971115 weighing 390 pounds.
972617 974326 Large, ain't he?<br />The undisputed
974411 975578 wrestling champion<br />of the world...
975662 979081 That's the biggest<br />arm in the world!
979165 983711 A man who calls himself "the<br />ultimate object of desire,"
984796 987381 "the mountain<br />of molten lust."
987465 991010 The one, the only<br />Thunderlips!
994431 997641 You're all trash!<br />You're all trash!
997767 1000978 You're all trash!<br />You're all trash!
1004274 1006400 The slugger from<br />Philadelphia...
1007694 1010696 You'd better shut up!
1011865 1013866 I'll break him in half.
1014367 1015784 How much do you<br />think he eats?
1015869 1018120 About 202 pounds.
1018204 1020914 ...weighing 202 pounds,
1020999 1024084 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
1024169 1026587 Rocky Balboa.
1027088 1031009 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1033429 1035221 Come to the center<br />of the ring, please.
1035306 1037098 Okay, come on, Mick.
1045066 1047025 All right, you guys,<br />you know this is for fun,
1047109 1049903 so take it easy and give them a good show.
1051364 1055533 Listen, after the match, how about<br />we get a Polaroid together, okay?
1056994 1058703 You're in trouble!
1059413 1061873 He got me mad. I'm gonna<br />break him in half like this.
1061957 1063750 Come on, Rocky, you can take him.
1063834 1066252 Seems like lately, everybody<br />wants to beat me up.
1066337 1068672 This is entertainment.<br />It's fun and games.
1068756 1071424 Stay away, make faces,<br />move around the ring.
1071550 1073468 - Got it, kid? All right.<br />- He is the ring.
1076180 1078682 I get nervous<br />every time he does that.
1083688 1087232 Whoa. You move pretty fast<br />for a big guy, you know that?
1087316 1089025 Listen, why don't we just<br />move around a little bit?
1089110 1090485 You know, like,<br />give them a good show.
1090569 1092654 First I'll chase you<br />and you chase me, okay?
1092738 1094447 How's that? All right? I'll go easy.
1094532 1096157 Here you go.<br />That okay?
1096283 1098034 Stay away from him!<br />Does that hurt? You all right?
1098119 1099536 Don't miss.
1099620 1101830 How's that, okay?<br />Not bad, huh?
1104625 1106042 Come on,<br />meatball. Come on.
1107211 1108254 Hey.
1111216 1113759 Think it's all fake,<br />meatball? All fake!
1113844 1116554 Thunderlips has gone<br />absolutely berserk.
1118473 1120307 Run for your life!
1120392 1121976 Blast off, meatball.
1129693 1133404 Get up, boy! Come on, meatball,<br />get some of this right here!
1139035 1141454 Rocko, remember<br />the neighborhood!
1142622 1144123 Get out of his way!
1144207 1146667 No, no, no! Not yet,<br />not for the meatball.
1146752 1148002 I'm not done<br />with him yet, boy.
1148086 1152047 If I can't break your spirit, I<br />sure enough can break your back.
1155135 1156886 Is Daddy having fun?
1156970 1158345 Of course.
1163810 1165936 Somebody hand me<br />a hatchet.
1167022 1168439 Holy smoke!
1168857 1172026 Here we go,<br />baby! Lights out, meatball!
1176364 1179450 Oh, my God! Balboa<br />is really in pain.
1179534 1182244 No one can believe the superhuman<br />strength of Thunderlips.
1183997 1185372 I am the man.
1185457 1186707 Stop him, will you?
1186792 1188418 You want<br />this punching bag?
1188503 1189544 Adrian!
1189629 1191588 Rocky!<br />Then you got him!
1191672 1193131 Catch me!
1193216 1198637 That's incredible! Balboa was<br />just heaved clear into the fifth row!
1198721 1201056 Now the fans<br />are outraged, too.
1202433 1206144 Now you got me mad! I'm gonna drag<br />him down the aisle like a dirty rag!
1206229 1208104 You weakling, Balboa.
1209398 1211483 Take it easy.<br />Take it easy!
1212443 1214110 What is it,<br />Mickey? You okay?
1214195 1215153 It's my heart.
1215238 1217280 The security guards<br />are rushing out to stop this.
1217365 1220283 People are flying<br />everywhere! Teeth are flying!
1220409 1221660 Cut my gloves off.
1221744 1223745 What,<br />you finished?
1223830 1225914 Come on, cut<br />my gloves off!
1227208 1230669 That place is a zoo! This<br />place has turned into a zoo!
1230753 1232045 This is very, very...
1232129 1234506 Want me to get<br />a doctor? You sure?
1234590 1236216 The girls have<br />gotten into it now.
1236300 1238093 They're getting<br />beat up, too.
1240763 1242889 Where are you going, you<br />fool? I'll be right back.
1242974 1245225 You're a maniac!<br />Come back here!
1245309 1247018 What are you doing?
1247103 1248395 Come back here!
1248479 1250313 Come on! You!
1250398 1253191 Get out of my way,<br />worms! I'm coming up!
1255903 1257529 Come on! Come on!
1262493 1264911 All right, Thunderlips,<br />break it up! Break it up!
1264996 1267123 No choking!<br />No choking!
1269960 1271502 Paulie, don't!
1274423 1276299 No, I don't<br />sweat you.
1285017 1286767 Hang on there, kid!
1288395 1290104 How do you<br />like it, huh?
1290188 1291981 You're kind of cute!
1292399 1293399 I don't need this.
1293483 1295985 Rocky is out-and-out<br />strangling him.
1296111 1298571 Rocky hanging on<br />like a bull terrier.
1298655 1301657 Now he's got him<br />in a stranglehold.
1301742 1304035 Rocky! Rocky!
1309917 1311334 The body!
1316340 1318174 Knock his block off!
1326183 1327934 Timber!
1330646 1334106 It's unbelievable!<br />Rocky actually did it!
1334191 1336567 The human skyscraper has<br />been thrown out of the ring!
1337819 1340738 All right, that's<br />it, that's it. Time is up.
1343700 1347871 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have a draw. A draw.
1349666 1352793 Thank you all for attending<br />this 12th annual charity match
1352877 1355420 between the Italian<br />Stallion, Rocky Balboa,
1355505 1357965 and Thunderlips,<br />the Ultimate Male.
1358049 1360342 See you next year.<br />Thank God.
1360426 1362719 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, pretty good.
1363096 1364596 Good match.
1364681 1366807 Hey, why'd you get so crazy on me out there?
1366891 1368934 That's the name<br />of the game.
1369018 1370435 Well, listen, while you're still calm,
1370520 1372437 can we get that<br />Polaroid together?
1372522 1373814 Yeah, sure.
1373898 1375649 Adrian, come<br />on over here.
1375733 1377985 My wife, Adrian.<br />My kid.
1378069 1379945 That's Thunderlips.<br />Would you do that?
1380029 1382572 That hurt. Okay, that's all right.
1382699 1385534 You know, sometimes<br />charity really hurts.
1389956 1392249 And this Pinocchio,<br />he told a lie, you see,
1392375 1393917 and his nose started<br />growing real big.
1394002 1396545 Why didn't<br />his ears grow?
1396629 1398922 I don't know. I didn't<br />write the story there.
1399007 1400424 Are you fighting again?
1400508 1403176 Today? No, I don't<br />plan on fighting today.
1403261 1404261 Promise?
1404345 1406304 Promise. Definitely, I promise.
1406389 1407764 Good, I like<br />you here.
1407849 1409349 Yeah? Well, I like<br />being here.
1409434 1410600 Are you getting hungry?
1410727 1412227 Huh? You want some breakfast? Yeah.
1412353 1413645 What do you want, Wheaties? Yeah.
1413730 1415313 What are Wheaties?<br />Champions!
1415398 1417357 Breakfast of what?<br />Champions! Champions.
1418860 1421987 And the father bear, he says,<br />"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed."
1422071 1425742 And the little kid bear said,<br />"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
1425826 1427201 "and there she is."
1427286 1429037 Thereby, he pulls<br />back the covers,
1429121 1433041 and thereby exposing her to<br />the, you know, public, see?
1433125 1435084 Come on, eat your cereal<br />before it sinks. Hurry up.
1435169 1437545 Then what happened to Goldilocks?
1437629 1439213 Happened to her?<br />I'm not exactly sure.
1439298 1441758 Busted for trespassing and<br />got 30 days in the cooler.
1441842 1443342 Oh, that's real<br />nice, Paulie.
1443510 1445053 That's nice<br />to tell the kid.
1445137 1448848 Rocky. Rocky,<br />the car is waiting.
1448932 1450224 Go ahead. You<br />guys better go.
1450309 1451809 Be a good boy, now.
1451894 1453394 We'll have a fun time,<br />me and the kid.
1453479 1454437 All right.
1454521 1457148 Mrs. Stallion, you<br />almost look pretty good.
1457232 1459108 Oh, thank you, Paulie.
1459651 1461527 Don't give the kid<br />any beer, all right?
1461612 1465031 Okay, we got to go. And Paulie, don't<br />take him to the track, all right?
1465115 1466574 How you doing, Mick?
1466658 1467867 Pretty good.
1469411 1471829 Now, we got a problem in the seventh.
1492434 1495812 Whatever happened to them<br />quiet, tender moments, huh?
1513248 1515749 Thank you. Thank you,<br />one and all.
1516042 1520170 Every once in a while, a person<br />comes along who defies the odds.
1520922 1526009 Who defies logic and<br />fulfills an incredible dream.
1526970 1530264 On behalf of all the citizens of Philadelphia
1530348 1533433 and the many who have been<br />touched by your accomplishments
1533518 1535644 and your untiring<br />participation
1535728 1538397 in this city's many<br />charity functions,
1538481 1542151 it is with tremendous honor<br />that we present this memorial
1542235 1544945 which will stand<br />always as a celebration
1545071 1547823 to the indomitable<br />spirit of man.
1548449 1552286 Philadelphia salutes its<br />favorite son, Rocky Balboa!
1564674 1565966 It's beautiful.
1566050 1568302 Definitely a thing<br />of beauty.
1568928 1571513 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1571598 1574016 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1574100 1576560 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1576644 1579021 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1579105 1581482 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1581609 1583985 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1584069 1585445 Thank you.
1589617 1591367 Thank you very much.
1596123 1599792 I don't know, what do you<br />say to something like this?
1602463 1604339 About three years ago,
1605424 1610553 this city really took<br />me inside, you know?
1613641 1617936 And I want to thank you very<br />much for that. I really do.
1619271 1621147 And I've been<br />thinking that...
1621232 1624734 I wasn't gonna bring this<br />up, but I might as well, now.
1625486 1629447 I would never do anything<br />to hurt this sport
1629531 1633660 that has been<br />so really good to me.
1634578 1638957 I've been talking it over<br />with my wife and my manager,
1640668 1642418 and we think that...
1643295 1646673 It's really hard to do<br />this. I feel like a bum.
1647591 1650510 I'm thinking maybe<br />it's time that I should
1651387 1655890 step down, maybe,<br />and retire.
1655975 1659435 No! No! No!
1659520 1661939 No, you can't<br />do that, Rocky.
1662023 1663399 Getting out<br />while you can?
1663483 1666110 Don't give this sucker<br />no statue. Give him guts.
1666194 1667945 I told you<br />I wasn't going away.
1668029 1669697 You got your shot,<br />now give me mine.
1669781 1671448 Why don't you get<br />the hell out of there!
1671574 1673284 Shut up, old man.<br />I ain't going nowhere.
1673368 1675786 Why don't you tell all these nice<br />folks why you been ducking me?
1675870 1678622 Politics, man. This country<br />wants to keep me down.
1678707 1679832 Keep everybody weak.
1679916 1681375 They don't want a man<br />like me to have the title,
1681459 1683335 because I'm not a puppet<br />like that fool up there.
1683420 1685462 You know, you've got<br />a big mouth, you know.
1685547 1688549 Why don't you come down and<br />close it, Balboa? Come on!
1688633 1689883 Anytime.
1689968 1691927 That guy's crazy.<br />Don't listen to him.
1692012 1693429 The little man don't<br />wanna come to me,
1693513 1695431 then I'll come to you<br />people and lay out the truth.
1695515 1697391 I am ranked<br />number one. One!
1697475 1698684 That means<br />I'm the best.
1698768 1701770 But this bum is taking the easy<br />matches, fighting other bums.
1701855 1703605 I'm telling you<br />and everybody here
1703690 1706108 I'll fight him anywhere,<br />anytime, for nothing.
1706276 1709737 Fight him,<br />Rock! Fight him!
1709821 1711530 But you people ain't<br />never gonna see that happen
1711614 1712906 because he's<br />gonna retire.
1712991 1715659 You see? He don't<br />fight no real man.
1715744 1717286 He fights them setups.<br />What?
1717370 1719204 You're a disgrace<br />to the sport.
1719289 1720581 Shut up, old man!<br />You and that chump
1720665 1722374 don't know where<br />I had to come from.
1722459 1724293 Balboa, your family's<br />doing real nice, ain't it?
1724377 1726545 You call yourself a fighter? Prove it now.
1726629 1728422 Give me the<br />same chance.
1728506 1730466 The way he's been<br />ducking me is a disgrace.
1730550 1732676 If he ain't no coward, why<br />don't he fight me, then?
1732761 1734303 I can't listen to any more<br />of this. Hey, anytime...
1734387 1736347 I don't care<br />what you're ranked.
1736431 1738724 You don't get no shot,<br />and I mean that!
1738808 1740101 I'm glad you<br />people are seeing this here.
1740186 1741811 What are you doing?<br />I want to fight this guy.
1741896 1743188 Well, you got him.
1743272 1745148 But you'll fight<br />him without me.
1746108 1747609 What are you saying?<br />It's finished.
1747693 1748943 Yes, I'm finished.
1749028 1750320 I don't want<br />no more of this.
1750404 1752405 I don't want no more,<br />you understand?
1752490 1755075 None of it!<br />It's over with!
1756952 1760205 Hey, woman. Hey, woman! Listen here.
1760289 1762123 Since your man<br />ain't got no heart,
1762208 1764084 maybe you'd like<br />to see a real man.
1764168 1765585 I bet you stay up<br />late every night
1765669 1767462 dreaming you had<br />a real man, don't you?
1767546 1769464 I'll tell you what. Bring<br />your pretty little self
1769548 1771216 over to my<br />apartment tonight,
1771300 1772675 and I'll show you<br />a real man.
1772760 1774719 You want it,<br />you got it!
1780643 1781684 You got it!
1788317 1791694 Rocky, don't. Come on,<br />Rocky, please, let's go talk.
1791779 1794030 Adrian.<br />Rocky, don't.
1794115 1796825 Rocky! Let's talk.
1801539 1802705 Why'd you leave?
1802790 1804290 Why'd you walk<br />away like that?
1804375 1806292 Life's too<br />short, kid.
1807169 1808586 Where you going?
1808671 1811339 I'm going on a<br />permanent vacation.
1812341 1814592 What are you talking about?<br />We got one more fight.
1814677 1816719 No, no. Not we, you.
1818557 1820516 Why are you<br />doing this?
1825272 1826730 I said, why are<br />you doing this?
1826815 1828941 Because you can't<br />win, Rock!
1829025 1832278 This guy will kill you to<br />death inside of three rounds!
1832362 1833404 You're crazy.
1833488 1834655 What else is new?
1834739 1835906 He's just<br />another fighter.
1835991 1837992 No, he ain't just<br />another fighter.
1838076 1841662 This guy is a wrecking<br />machine, and he's hungry!
1841746 1844290 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt!
1844374 1846667 What are you talking about?<br />I've had 10 title defenses.
1846751 1847918 That was easy!
1848003 1849086 What do you<br />mean, easy?
1849171 1850963 They was hand-picked!
1854134 1856802 Setups?<br />No, they weren't setups.
1856887 1860639 They was good fighters, but they<br />wasn't killers like this guy.
1860724 1863267 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
1883079 1884580 Jeez, Mick.
1886917 1888501 Why'd you do it?
1891087 1893506 Because the beating<br />that you got
1893590 1895799 from Apollo should<br />have killed you, kid.
1896092 1897135 It didn't.
1897220 1901431 It was my job to keep you<br />winning and to keep you healthy.
1907271 1910440 You really don't think I<br />got nothing left, do you?
1911234 1915320 Well, Rock, let's<br />put it this way.
1917114 1919741 Three years ago<br />you was supernatural.
1920618 1924120 You was... You was hard and you was nasty
1924205 1927249 and you had<br />this cast-iron jaw.
1928292 1932712 But then the worst<br />thing happened to you
1932797 1935715 that could happen<br />to any fighter.
1935800 1939010 You got civilized. Yeah.
1943558 1945350 Don't worry, kid.
1945726 1950397 You know, presidents retire, generals retire,
1950481 1954317 horses retire,<br />Man o' War retired.
1954735 1956778 They put him<br />out to stud.
1957947 1960657 That's what you<br />should've done, retire.
1964287 1966871 I can't retire knowing all this, Mick.
1967456 1970208 Don't push it. Well, you been carrying me.
1970668 1972002 We don't need it.
1972086 1973628 You been carrying<br />me, though.
1974463 1976257 I haven't been<br />carrying you.
1976341 1977466 I've been<br />protecting you.
1977551 1980886 No. Look, I want this fight. Just one more.
1980971 1982179 No, we don't need it.
1982264 1984181 I'll live in the gym.
1984266 1985391 We don't need it.
1985475 1986892 Mick, I do.
1988103 1990229 I'm asking you to train me one last time.
1990314 1992398 Oh, no, I can't.
1992482 1993774 If you don't,
1995068 1998279 I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't bought<br />a new pair of underwear in 10 years.
2000365 2002116 You would,<br />wouldn't you?
2002200 2003868 Yeah, absolutely.
2006538 2008205 No, no.
2008290 2009540 Come on.
2011376 2013753 One more time,<br />it's over.
2015547 2016672 It's a deal?<br />Come on, come on.
2016757 2019258 It's your head, kid.<br />It's your head.
2022763 2025473 Yeah, it is.<br />Thanks, Mick.

2061094 2063679 On the night of the fight
2063763 2065138 I will survive
2065223 2069017 There's nowhere to run,<br />there's nowhere to hide
2069102 2070852 On the night of the fight
2070937 2072938 It's just you and I
2073022 2077275 There's nowhere to run,<br />there's nowhere to hide...
2077360 2079152 Right here.<br />Once in a lifetime!
2079237 2080737 Get your buttons here!
2080947 2083365 You can't stand<br />toe-to-toe with this guy
2083449 2085992 or he'll deposit<br />you up there on Mars.
2086244 2088995 He's too tough.<br />He's too strong.
2090331 2094751 Listen, how the hell can we<br />train in this creep joint here?
2094877 2096294 I mean, this is<br />kind of a house
2096379 2098213 of ill reputes or<br />something, isn't it?
2098297 2100215 Why did you<br />rent this joint?
2100299 2102801 Oh, come on, Mickey. Let's<br />go out in style, okay?
2102885 2105345 You wanna go out in style,<br />go out in one piece!
2105430 2107013 Now, come on, let's get out of here!
2107098 2108807 Let's go back to<br />the old gym, will you?
2108891 2111351 Let's get some blood and<br />sweat and tears around you!
2111436 2112853 Can we do that?
2112937 2115897 Hey, will you just relax and enjoy it, okay?
2120111 2121778 They love it, Mick.
2128995 2131496 Go on, fight!<br />Fight now, go ahead!
2131581 2134167 Fight it, fight it.<br />Get rough, get tough.
2134251 2136002 Get brutal.<br />That's it.
2136086 2138045 Excuse me. Could I get a kiss?
2138130 2139213 Yeah, sure.
2139673 2141257 Get out of here,<br />will you?
2141341 2143009 This is like<br />fighting in a zoo.
2143093 2144719 This is a zoo,<br />you know?
2144803 2146596 Is that the way you<br />train for Clubber?
2146680 2148097 He ain't gonna<br />kiss you.
2148182 2150141 He's gonna kill you,<br />you know that?
2150225 2151350 Go on. Get<br />out of here!
2157191 2159317 Rock, how about a picture? Yeah, sure.
2159401 2160693 There you go.<br />Rock.
2172080 2173664 Rocky! Rocky!
2201235 2202568 Put a little<br />speed on there.
2202653 2203986 Put a little<br />speed on there.
2204071 2206239 Thattaboy.<br />That's it.
2215542 2217960 All right, this will<br />tell us the story.
2218044 2222464 That's it! Side to side!<br />Side to side, Rock!
2223258 2225092 Shut up back there,<br />can't you?
2225176 2226677 Change your tune or...
2226761 2229596 That's it.<br />Pull front punches. That's it, kid.
2229681 2231056 You're a deadly weapon.
2231140 2234017 Time! Time, time,<br />time. Quit it.
2234477 2236270 You're okay.<br />Come on.
2236980 2239356 Here. Put this on before you catch pneumonia.
2239440 2241191 Okay. I'll give<br />you a little rubdown, too.
2241276 2243360 Yeah.<br />And listen, kid.
2243444 2247698 I don't like to hear much of<br />what comes out of people's mouths
2247782 2250409 and I don't like<br />soft-talking moments.
2250493 2251577 That's for sure.
2251661 2253871 You know,<br />but I just wanna tell you one thing,
2253955 2255539 that I'm proud<br />of you.
2257041 2258166 Well, thanks<br />a lot.
2258251 2259418 That's all<br />right, kid.
2259502 2261295 Let's get out of here, shall we? Hey, Mick.
2261379 2262588 Yeah?
2262672 2264381 What do you think we're gonna<br />do when it's all over, huh?
2264465 2268051 I don't know. Maybe join up with<br />a circus or something. All right.
2268136 2270345 Yeah, maybe. All right, let's get out.
2277186 2279855 Good evening, everyone. Along<br />with Bill Baldwin, I'm Stu Nahan.
2279939 2282357 And we welcome you to tonight's<br />heavyweight title fight
2282525 2285027 Which may prove to be<br />the most memorable of all.
2285111 2286737 For tonight is<br />the champion's final
2286821 2289239 and perhaps most<br />difficult title defense.
2289324 2291492 Rocky, do you feel you're in<br />the best shape of your career?
2291577 2293411 Oh, yeah, absolutely.<br />I feel real good.
2293495 2296331 He's a deadly weapon, he's one<br />of a kind. And he's gonna do it.
2296415 2298082 Clubber, do you<br />think you're as fast as Balboa?
2298167 2299834 I don't wanna do no talking.<br />I'll do my talking in the ring.
2299919 2301753 Clubber,<br />dance for us.
2303589 2305048 I told you, you better get out of here!
2305132 2306507 I want to be alone!
2306592 2308259 Will you<br />retire after this fight?
2308344 2309886 Oh, yeah, this is<br />the last one for sure.
2309970 2311512 After this, me and<br />Mick are finished.
2311639 2313181 This is definitely<br />the last one.
2313265 2315141 You're all parasites<br />and leeches.
2315225 2316392 Get out of here!
2316477 2318770 What will<br />you do after tonight?
2319563 2321522 I'm not sure.
2321607 2323483 Maybe join the circus,<br />huh, Mick?
2323567 2325568 Yeah, have some fun.
2325653 2326945 Come on,<br />take your robe off.
2327029 2329656 Come on,<br />take off your robe!
2329740 2332283 I told you to<br />get out of my face!
2332368 2333785 With us this evening is the former
2333869 2335203 heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
2335287 2336537 Apollo Creed.
2336622 2338164 Do you have any predictions on this fight?
2338248 2340208 How do you see this<br />fight going tonight?
2340292 2343127 Well, I feel that strength would<br />have to go to the challenger,
2343212 2345213 while experience and<br />the world's hardest head
2345297 2346631 would have to go<br />to Rocky Balboa.
2346715 2347924 And you know<br />I know about that.
2348300 2350969 Now remember, Rock,<br />don't trade with this guy.
2351053 2353012 Take your time.<br />Wear him down.
2353138 2355139 But don't stand toe-to-toe<br />with him. Mmm-hmm.
2355224 2358226 This punk's never been<br />15 rounds before.
2358894 2360478 Take him good.<br />Okay.
2360562 2361896 Take him good.<br />I will.
2361981 2363356 That's it.
2363983 2365441 So I predict that the<br />champ's gonna take this one.
2365526 2368027 Now, wait a minute. Do you really<br />think the champ can hit that hard?
2369405 2370739 Why do you think I'm<br />sitting out here with you?
2389217 2390384 Hey, sucker!
2390468 2392386 Balboa, you gone,<br />you finished!
2392470 2395139 You through! You washed up!<br />I'm the baddest in the world!
2395223 2396598 You don't look<br />so bad to me.
2396683 2398017 What you say,<br />paper champion?
2398101 2399184 I'm gonna beat<br />you like a dog.
2399269 2400352 A dog, you hear me!
2400437 2402354 Can't you get that<br />ape back into the ring?
2402439 2404606 You made me wait too long! You gonna pay!
2404691 2406692 Come on, mouth!<br />Get out of my way.
2406776 2408485 Get him out<br />of there, can't you?
2408570 2410279 Get him out of there!
2414409 2415826 Get out of my way!<br />Get out of my way!
2415910 2418037 Back up.
2418121 2420039 You know who I am? You know who I am?
2420123 2422041 I'm the man!<br />I'm the man!
2425754 2429131 You're dead meat!<br />You're dead meat! Let me go!
2429215 2431550 Rocky! Rocky!
2431634 2433177 Get off!
2433261 2434887 What's the<br />matter? Mick!
2434971 2437347 What's wrong, Adrian?<br />Get a doctor!
2437432 2439808 Somebody get a doctor!<br />Come on!
2441603 2444188 Sit here, Mick.<br />Get them out of here.
2446441 2448275 Get them out of here!
2449278 2450570 Come on, Mick, will you sit on the table?
2450654 2451988 Mick? Mick!<br />I'm all right.
2452073 2454240 Just take a deep breath.<br />Get those guys out of here!
2454325 2456534 Move! Mick, will<br />you sit on the...
2456619 2458912 Paulie. Paulie, tell them<br />the fight's off. Go on. Go on!
2458996 2460246 No! The fight's<br />not off.
2460331 2461790 What, are you out of your mind or something?
2461874 2463374 The fight's on.<br />Are you crazy?
2463459 2464918 Mick, we can't. Not<br />tonight. I ain't fighting...
2465002 2466795 Yes, tonight.<br />We're gonna fight.
2466879 2468880 Just let me get my breath.<br />Can't I get my breath?
2468964 2470048 Is that against the rules or something?
2470132 2472050 Mick... Will you<br />please get a doctor?
2472134 2474010 Paulie, go on.<br />He's on his way.
2474095 2475470 Mick, I can't go out<br />there and fight like this.
2475554 2476805 I can't<br />go out there like this.
2476889 2479599 Now, get out there.<br />Get going, will you?
2479683 2481059 Take him.<br />Take him good.
2481143 2482435 Get it over with,<br />why don't you?
2482520 2485522 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
2485606 2488191 Adrian, what am<br />I supposed to do?
2488275 2490276 What the hell do you mean,<br />what are you supposed to do?
2490361 2493404 After all these years together,<br />you don't know what to do?
2493489 2494948 You ought to be<br />ashamed of yourself.
2495032 2497033 Now get out there<br />and do it!
2498619 2499786 Do it.
2501497 2502664 Do it!
2503499 2505083 You're the best.
2505584 2508753 Okay. Okay.
2508879 2512048 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
2512133 2513591 Oh, my God.
2516137 2519055 Adrian, take care of him.<br />Take care of him.

2540829 2545332 the King of Sting, the<br />one and only Apollo Creed!
2546835 2548919 And there he is,<br />the former heavyweight
2549004 2551005 champion of the world,<br />Apollo Creed.
2551089 2553299 Stu, he looks<br />like $9 million.
2553675 2554758 Get out of my face.
2554843 2556385 I don't need nothing you got no more.
2556469 2558846 Don't need no has-been<br />messing in my corner.
2558930 2561849 And you better get that bad look<br />off your face before I knock it off!
2561933 2564560 Come on. Want to jump?<br />Jump, come on.
2565103 2567313 Come on, Creed.<br />Come on.
2568982 2572401 Yeah, come on. Yeah, just<br />like a chicken. You better run.
2577407 2580367 Give everybody a present and<br />drop this chump, all right?
2580452 2582578 All right.<br />Good luck to you.
2587292 2588709 All right, fans,<br />here we go.
2588793 2591712 Presenting to you, on my<br />left, out of the blue corner,
2591796 2597051 hailing from Chicago, weighing<br />in at an even 235 pounds,
2597135 2600054 the world's number<br />one challenger...
2600138 2601388 I wonder how<br />Mick's doing.
2601473 2603432 ...the undefeated<br />Clubber Lang.
2604851 2608313 I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best.
2608814 2611733 You and Clubber exchanged<br />words up there. Any comment?
2611817 2612859 I have no comment.
2614070 2615487 And his opponent<br />in the opposite corner
2615571 2619241 really needing no introduction<br />the world over.
2619325 2622827 He weighs in at<br />a trim 201 pounds,
2622912 2627707 the pride of Philadelphia,<br />the Italian Stallion,
2627792 2631920 and the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
2632004 2635590 Rocky Balboa!
2638761 2640637 Listen<br />to this crowd.
2646602 2648436 Now to give instructions<br />in the middle of the ring,
2648521 2651147 the referee, Marty Denkin.
2654068 2655193 Clubber, Rocky,<br />you know the rules.
2655861 2657028 I want a good,<br />clean fight.
2657113 2658697 When I tell you to break,<br />I want you to step back
2658781 2660073 at my command<br />and break.
2660157 2663952 Now, go back to the corner and<br />come out fighting at the bell.
2664704 2666037 Dead meat.
2671377 2674087 This is not gonna<br />be a fight of finesse.
2674171 2676381 These are two guys<br />that really throw punches.
2676507 2678174 This thing could end with one<br />punch. The chump is scared.
2678301 2680593 Scared. Scared. Yeah. Tear him up, champ.
2680678 2682721 See the look<br />in his eyes?
2684265 2688185 I'm no trainer. Just go out and<br />kill the guy. Kill him, Rock.
2689396 2690938 He's scared.
2691857 2693816 I'm the new champion. I'm<br />the new champion as of today.
2693900 2695109 I'm the new champion as of today.
2695193 2697153 The Italian Stallion.<br />A rugged champion
2697237 2700698 in the final fight of his<br />colorful career tonight.
2700782 2702116 And Jimmy Lennon<br />was correct.
2702242 2704577 He looks like...<br />Well, just great.
2705287 2709081 Here we go! Oh, boy,<br />the champion came out swinging.
2709166 2710416 Break his head!
2710500 2712543 Balboa's off to<br />an incredible start!
2712627 2716047 He looks determined to<br />destroy the bigger challenger.
2718675 2720134 Clubber, get in<br />there, get in there!
2720218 2721927 Move him back.<br />Move him back.
2726516 2727933 Defense!
2728435 2729894 Now it is Balboa.
2729978 2731604 They're going at<br />each other now.
2734149 2736442 You got him!<br />You got him, Rock!
2736818 2738652 Double up!<br />Double up!
2741198 2744658 Come on. Come on,<br />Balboa! Come on!
2746745 2750289 The challenger is hitting<br />him with everything he's got.
2750540 2751582 No!
2752501 2754085 Come on, Balboa!
2754753 2757046 Come on, Balboa!<br />Make me weak.
2757714 2760549 Come on, Balboa!<br />Come on.
2766599 2769893 Clubber away. Trying<br />to get him back to his corner.
2769977 2771645 Grab him, Paulie.
2772980 2774564 Where's Mick?<br />Where's Mick?
2774649 2775732 He's okay.
2775817 2777359 I need him now.<br />I need him here.
2777443 2780404 He ain't nothing. I told you he<br />ain't nothing. He ain't nothing.
2780488 2781780 He's too strong.
2781864 2783907 Don't talk like that, Rocko. Come on.
2783991 2785075 Tear him up!<br />I'm gonna smoke him.
2785159 2787244 I'm gonna smoke him.<br />I'm gonna smoke him.
2787328 2789830 I can't keep him off.<br />I can't keep him off.
2790164 2791581 He's mine.<br />He's mine!
2791666 2793083 I'm gonna get him!<br />I'm gonna get him!
2793167 2795168 I'm losing it, Paulie.<br />Where's Mick?
2797338 2799423 What do you got<br />200 over 50.
2799507 2801550 All right,<br />let's start CPR.
2802468 2803844 Rock, you can do it.
2803928 2805011 I'll try.
2806639 2808807 Rocky appears<br />to be staggering.
2808975 2810434 Yeah, I'll get him.
2810518 2812727 Coming out of the corner, here comes Clubber.
2814105 2816481 Come on, Rocky,<br />show him. Let's go. Come on.
2816566 2820235 Come on, Balboa! Come on! Come<br />on, oversized hick! Give it to me.
2820319 2823196 Let's see what you can do. Bring it to me!
2824198 2825866 Move on the inside!
2827034 2829494 The champion<br />is nearly helpless.
2829579 2831663 My gosh, what a beating he's taking.
2836544 2838462 Don't stand<br />toe-to-toe with him!
2838546 2840172 Come on, Balboa!
2858650 2859859 Get up!
2859943 2863154 Get up, sucker!
2863238 2865448 Five. Six.<br />Come on, get up! Get up!
2865532 2870995 Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.<br />You're out!
2871246 2872371 The champion<br />is finished!
2872498 2874207 I did it! I'm the<br />best! In the second round!
2874291 2875500 I'm the man!<br />I beat Balboa!
2875584 2877168 Unbelievable.<br />Incredible upset.
2877252 2880838 Balboa in the corner, out on<br />his feet. Out of the plank.
2886345 2888387 We have the time.
2888472 2890348 The winner by knockout,
2890432 2895895 the new heavyweight champion<br />of the world, Clubber Lang!
2895979 2900191 Yeah, I told you.<br />I told you I'd do it.
2900275 2903319 Yeah! I'm the new<br />champ of the world!
2912037 2913204 Come on,<br />get out of here!
2913288 2914789 Get out of here, now.
2919461 2920670 Oh, Rocky,<br />what happened?
2920754 2921879 I'm all right,<br />how's Mick?
2921964 2923590 He wouldn't go to the<br />hospital till you got here.
2923675 2925592 - What?<br />- Mr. Balboa, time is important.
2925677 2927844 We must get him to the hospital immediately.
2927929 2929012 Okay.
2943027 2944069 Mick?
2944821 2946196 Yeah?
2946281 2947489 Mick.
2949367 2953495 What? What? What?<br />Is it over?
2953997 2957291 Yeah, it's all over.
2957625 2961003 Hey, listen,<br />what happened?
2962088 2963797 It was a knockout.
2965675 2968051 What round?<br />What round?
2968136 2969970 Second round.
2972181 2973724 Yeah, I knew it.
2973808 2976351 That's good.<br />We did it, huh?
2976436 2979229 We did it. We did it. All right.
2979314 2981273 You don't have to worry<br />about nothing no more.
2981357 2982608 No. Good.
2982692 2984109 Everything's gonna be okay, Mick.
2984193 2986236 You know? Yeah. I knew that we did it.
2986321 2988697 You gotta get<br />to the hospital.
2988823 2991158 You're not as young<br />as you used to be.
2991242 2993827 You're the winner.
2993911 2996663 We did everything right.<br />I did everything...
2996748 2999625 No, no, listen. We ain't<br />done everything right.
2999709 3001628 Listen, we got<br />more to do.
3001712 3004797 Mick, whatever you wanna<br />do, we'll do it, okay?
3004882 3007634 I love you, kid.<br />I love you.
3008886 3010720 Mick?
3010804 3012597 It hurts me.
3015184 3016309 Mick?
3020731 3021939 Mick?
3030574 3031908 Mick.
3043962 3046172 Oh, God!
3052596 3056391 Don't go away,<br />please, don't.
3056475 3059352 All the things<br />we didn't do.
3059436 3062355 We got more<br />to do. We got...
3063607 3068277 Oh, my God!<br />Oh, Jesus.
3127255 3129673 This concludes<br />our service.
3304100 3306393 That's not<br />the way to do it.
3306478 3307853 Who's that?
3309189 3312149 Why don't you hit it straight? Step into it.
3314527 3316320 Apollo?
3316404 3319366 Right. I waited at your<br />house for about an hour
3319450 3322077 and your wife said<br />you might be here.
3322453 3324037 What are you<br />doing here?
3324163 3325705 Business.
3327291 3329167 If the papers knew we were talking like this,
3329251 3331378 they'd think<br />we was crazy.
3331963 3333296 Why you?
3333381 3336591 Because I'm the best, and you need<br />somebody to teach you different.
3336717 3338843 Why? Well, to be honest with you,
3338928 3341179 I don't think you could<br />pull it off without me, Rock.
3341263 3345850 You still didn't give me the answer,<br />Apollo. What's the real reason?
3345935 3348228 Listen. It's quiet,<br />isn't it?
3349689 3351940 When you retire,<br />it's too quiet.
3352066 3354359 I mean, we're too<br />young to retire anyway.
3354443 3356695 Besides, with<br />the right touch,
3356779 3358989 I could promote this thing into<br />the biggest gig of all time.
3359073 3360865 It'd be bigger<br />than ours.
3360950 3365161 Heaven knows, I don't mind being<br />involved with large numbers, right?
3366706 3369249 I don't need this<br />no more. I...
3369333 3371459 I don't want<br />this no more.
3372211 3377465 Look, man. When you beat me, I hurt all over
3377550 3381761 and I didn't want to know from<br />nothing or nobody, not even my kids.
3381846 3383930 Hell, every fighter<br />knows that hurt.
3384015 3387183 And we get sick inside trying to<br />live with it, so don't back off now.
3387268 3391187 Make it right for yourself<br />or you'll be sorry you didn't.
3391272 3394691 We held the greatest title<br />in the whole world, babe.
3396611 3399030 You lost that fight, Rock,<br />for all the wrong reasons.
3399114 3401490 You lost your edge.
3401575 3406454 All right, I know your manager<br />dying had you all messed up inside.
3407456 3410166 But the truth is, you didn't look hungry.
3410876 3412752 Now, when we fought,
3413754 3416797 you had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge.
3416882 3418215 And now you<br />gotta get it back.
3418300 3420593 And the way to get it back is<br />to go back to the beginning.
3420677 3423846 You know<br />what I mean?
3423930 3426474 Maybe we could win<br />it back together.
3428226 3430102 Eye of the tiger, man.
3433940 3436067 Why'd you have<br />to come here?
3437069 3439487 I have the plan.<br />Get back, man.
3442574 3444325 You got me curious.
3446328 3448329 You got me curious, Rock.
3453085 3457129 Clubber, do you accept the<br />challenge for a rematch with Balboa?
3457214 3460591 I reject the challenge,<br />because Balboa is no challenge.
3460675 3463135 But I'd be more than happy<br />to beat up on him some more.
3463220 3464970 I always said<br />he was nothing.
3465055 3466764 I can't wait to<br />see this bum fall.
3466848 3469934 What do you think of him<br />being trained by Apollo Creed?
3470018 3471310 Apollo who?
3471394 3473521 You talking about that old fool,<br />Apollo Creed?
3473647 3475816 Shucks, one has-been teaching<br />another. Yeah, just keep talking, pal.
3475900 3476942 That's all Apollo been doing... Keep talking.
3477026 3478610 ...running off at<br />the mouth lately.
3478694 3480904 And when I see him, I'm<br />gonna close it for him.
3480988 3483657 All right. When will<br />the match take place?
3483741 3484908 The sooner,<br />the better.
3484992 3486201 I'm the champion<br />of the world.
3486285 3487661 And nothing can<br />be done about that.
3487745 3490038 I can't be beat,<br />and I won't be beat.
3490123 3491748 This time I'm gonna<br />train even harder.
3491833 3493375 There won't be no<br />quick knockdowns.
3493459 3494751 I'm gonna torture him.
3494836 3497045 I'm gonna crucify<br />him real bad.
3497213 3499422 Hard words<br />from a hard man.
3499507 3503385 The odds against Balboa<br />making a comeback at 34
3503469 3505220 are very long indeed.
3505304 3508473 Can he do it?<br />Most experts doubt it.
3508558 3513812 Balboa was a fine champion, but his<br />time has passed. I wish him luck.
3515064 3516940 Don't listen<br />to it, Rocky.
3517024 3519609 No, do listen<br />to it, Rock.
3519694 3524072 When this is over, a lot of folks<br />are gonna owe you an engraved apology.
3526242 3527534 And you're gonna<br />owe me a big favor.
3527618 3529161 What favor?
3529912 3531788 When it's over.
3537086 3540380 Rocko, come on. We're<br />gonna be late at the airport.
3541549 3543717 - Let's go.<br />- Think we forgot anything?
3544093 3546595 I think we have it<br />all. Maybe another sweater.
3546679 3548471 No, California's<br />not that cold.
3548556 3550307 It's great, great.<br />A scorcher.
3550391 3552809 Okay, listen, I want you<br />to be a good boy, okay?
3552935 3555354 Okay. And don't give anybody a hard time.
3555439 3559692 Okay.<br />Give me a kiss. Yeah.
3565949 3568826 We'll call when we land. Yeah, we'll call.
3572831 3575208 You'll be a good<br />boy? All right.
3575292 3577668 I'll bring you<br />back something.
3592351 3594727 I been told by
3596063 3598481 Some people and they all
3599691 3601984 Say to take you back
3604154 3606697 Take you back like before
3608242 3611160 I don't call that a reason
3612537 3618000 I just call it<br />believin' in myself
3618752 3621295 Believin' in myself
3623257 3625049 What the hell are<br />we doing here in LA?
3625133 3626259 Hey, man, this is<br />where I started.
3626343 3627426 Yeah, so?
3627511 3629178 So this is<br />where he's starting.
3629263 3630429 But this place<br />is disgusting.
3630514 3631597 Why don't we stay<br />at your place?
3631682 3633267 Look, I think you're missing the point.
3633351 3635727 Let's just go on and check in and<br />get over to the gym, all right?
3635812 3638272 Rock, in my opinion,<br />we don't need this place.
3638356 3640107 It's below you and the sister's standard.
3640191 3643485 We're gonna give it a try,<br />Paulie. Come on, Adrian.
3654747 3656498 I don't even<br />have a gun.
3664215 3665257 You know,<br />fun is fun.
3665341 3669094 I like those kind of things, but<br />this I don't like. Look at this place.
3669178 3672639 Rats even have more pride<br />than to be caught dead here.
3673641 3675726 I mean, look<br />at the dump.
3675810 3677019 I just don't like it.
3677103 3679688 - Think of Adrian's health.<br />- I'm fine, Paulie.
3702670 3703879 Balboa.
3703963 3705255 What's he<br />doing out here?
3711722 3713848 This is where<br />I started.
3713932 3715433 That's your problem.
3715851 3717935 Rocko, let's leave before<br />they leave us for dead.
3721273 3724233 Yeah, you see that look in their eyes, Rock?
3725736 3727320 When we fought, Rock,<br />I trained hard,
3727404 3728529 but I didn't have<br />that look in my eyes.
3728614 3730948 You had it.<br />You won.
3732785 3735036 You gotta get<br />that look back, Rock.
3735120 3736704 Eye of the tiger, man.
3736789 3738498 Eye of the tiger,<br />come on.
3738582 3740416 Come on, let's go.
3740501 3743461 Look at this place.<br />No class in here.
3743545 3744879 Is he always<br />so cheerful?
3744963 3746297 I don't sweat you.
3746382 3748716 Hey. Hey, Paulie. Don't<br />get mentally irregular.
3748801 3750134 It's a free country.
3750219 3751928 Just don't get irregular, all right?
3752012 3754263 I don't need no<br />philosophy lesson here.
3754348 3756391 Well, it just takes about<br />six years to get to know...
3756475 3758935 Well, I ain't<br />got six years.
3759019 3761437 Hey, come on,<br />Paulie. Just relax.
3761563 3763981 Come on. We're on business.
3767194 3769112 Hey! Hey, champ!
3769196 3771280 Hey, Duke, my man.
3771365 3772824 Hey, everything's set<br />up and ready to go, baby.
3772908 3774575 Good. I know you know who<br />this man is, don't you?
3774660 3776035 Yeah. It's gonna be good working with you.
3776370 3778246 Certainly had enough<br />of working against you.
3778330 3779997 Hey, how you feel?<br />Pretty good, thanks.
3780082 3781582 He's doing great. We've been living modern,
3781667 3783084 but now we're<br />gonna train old.
3783168 3784961 I'm going over here and talk<br />to some of the guys, all right.
3785045 3787130 Hey! The<br />champ is home!
3789675 3792428 We gotta leave.<br />I got a reputation.
3792512 3793679 What do you mean,<br />reputation?
3793763 3796223 You heard. I don't like these people.
3796307 3798225 You don't like them?
3799644 3802438 Maybe they don't like you either, Paulie.
3802522 3804398 What'd I do to them?
3805608 3807317 And they call<br />me punchy.
3807402 3810612 Hey, Stallion, Stallion, come on<br />over here and meet some of the fellas.
3810697 3812156 I'll be right back.
3812240 3814032 How you doing, guys?
3825336 3827963 That's it, that's<br />it. Come on, on the toes.
3828047 3829465 On the toes,<br />on the toes.
3829549 3831091 On the toes, come on.
3831176 3832676 On the toes,<br />on the toes.
3833720 3835220 Come on, Rock.
3835972 3838056 He ain't too graceful.
3838141 3839808 That's why we're<br />here, Paulie.
3840101 3842519 Waste of time.<br />He's got heavy feet.
3842604 3844146 Get on the balls<br />of your feet.
3844230 3846190 Come on, relax, Rock.
3846274 3848192 Come on, get those feet out<br />of the concrete. Come on.
3848276 3850277 It'll take time,<br />but it'll come.
3850361 3853780 He can't train to<br />the jungle junk music.
3853907 3855991 Here we go. Here we go, come on.
3856117 3857951 On the balls of<br />Balance.
3858036 3859077 Let your body<br />find the rhythm.
3859162 3861788 Gonna start a new<br />dance called the crawl.
3861873 3864500 I'm telling you, you can't<br />train him like a colored fighter.
3864584 3865751 He ain't got<br />no rhythm.
3865835 3866960 All right?<br />Come on.
3867045 3868045 How stupid<br />do I look?
3868129 3869631 You look great.<br />You look great.
3869715 3872759 Everything we do works<br />off the jab. You can do it.
3873594 3874677 Yeah.
3875679 3876930 Can he swim?
3877056 3878264 With a name<br />like Rock?
3878891 3880475 No time to<br />waste! Let's go!
3880559 3882060 Another lap!<br />Another lap!
3882144 3884062 Move it!<br />Another lap!
3884146 3886523 He ain't no tuna. We belong back in the gym.
3886607 3888149 Look, he's gotta stretch and use muscles
3888234 3890193 he never thought he had. Come on, Rock!
3890277 3891694 Come on, stretch now!
3891779 3893321 Come on, move it,<br />Rock! Move it!
3893405 3894572 Nobody can<br />change that much.
3894657 3897033 He's a bruiser.<br />He ain't no boxer.
3897117 3899035 You keep telling him<br />that and he'll be nothing.
3899119 3900495 You know?<br />Yeah?
3900579 3902455 Another lap! Come on now! Move it!
3903666 3906000 Move it! Come on! Move it, Rock! Move it!
3906085 3908044 Come on, let's go.<br />Let's go!
3908212 3910213 That's it, stretch it!<br />Stretch it out!
3910297 3913258 That's it, let's go. You<br />gotta pull. Hard now, hard!
3921433 3924644 Shut up, you Sterno bums!<br />I'll squash you!
3925145 3927021 There's decent people trying to sleep!
3927106 3929732 Shut up, you honky<br />scum bastard mother!
3930442 3932610 Who needs<br />this sick place?
3932945 3934153 I don't.
3935614 3936864 No class.
3940494 3942662 Damn, that<br />Clubber's strong.
3943205 3945456 Fifteen rounds is<br />a long time.
3946917 3949044 We gotta put<br />him away early.
3950505 3951755 I figure with the<br />pace we gotta set,
3951840 3955301 Rock can last maybe<br />seven or eight rounds.
3956970 3959763 Then we'll be<br />out of steam, man.
3959848 3962016 We got to put<br />him away early.
3965520 3967521 At least<br />the water's hot.
3970942 3973569 Well, we never really had a honeymoon.
3975780 3977364 It's not so bad.
3979826 3981910 We've been in<br />worse places.
3983413 3985623 In the corner, Rocky's<br />in trouble in round two!
3985707 3987041 He takes a right!<br />Another right!
3987125 3989043 He's been cut!<br />Rocky's been cut!
3991212 3994298 Come on, Rock.<br />Come on, come on, now.
3994382 3996800 Come on. You gotta get<br />tougher. You gotta get tougher.
3996885 3998302 Think smooth.<br />Think smooth.
3998386 3999553 Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.
3999638 4001847 Toes, toes, on<br />your toes, Rock.
4001931 4004099 On your toes! On your toes! On your toes!
4005352 4007811 Push yourself, Rock!<br />Concentrate.
4007896 4009563 Let's move it, Rock!<br />Move it, now!
4009648 4011523 Come on, Rock,<br />come on!
4011608 4014360 Have fun with this.<br />Have fun with it.
4014944 4016987 That's it.<br />Easy, easy, easy.
4017113 4019156 Smooth. On the toes.
4019240 4021575 Don't push it, don't push it. Let it come.
4021660 4024328 It'll come. This takes time, baby.
4024412 4026205 - This takes time.<br />- Come on, move your head.
4026289 4029167 Move your head. Move your head up and down.
4029251 4032379 Come on, come on. Swift<br />now, up and down. In and out.
4032463 4035924 Inside. Inside.<br />Inside, baby.
4036008 4037217 Side to side.<br />Move your head.
4037301 4038510 Watch it now.<br />Watch it now.
4038594 4040845 Remember, he's got<br />two hands, right?
4045267 4047352 Damn, man, what the hell are you doing?
4047436 4049688 This guy will knock you on your ass!
4051982 4054025 Come on, Rock,<br />it's not a game.
4054110 4058029 You want to lay up in a hospital<br />for five weeks this time?
4058114 4060532 You thought I was tough?<br />This chump will kill you.
4060616 4061741 All right.
4061826 4064244 Come on, come on. Get your<br />head on your shoulders, man.
4064328 4066371 Think about the fight!<br />Think about the fight!
4066455 4069207 Clubber Lang's in, he's trying to hurt<br />you, Rock. He's trying to hurt you.
4069291 4071751 Okay, here it comes.<br />Jab! He's jabbing!
4071836 4073461 He's jabbing! He's trying to hurt you.
4073546 4075880 You gotta fight.<br />You gotta move.
4077842 4079634 He's up<br />against the ropes!
4079719 4081469 He can't get<br />out of the corner.
4085808 4088268 He's hooked you! He's<br />hooked you! He's hooked you!
4088352 4090145 Damn, Rock, come on!
4091105 4092605 What's the matter<br />with you?
4092690 4094899 Tomorrow. Let's<br />do it tomorrow.
4094984 4096776 There is no tomorrow!
4098028 4099821 There is no tomorrow!
4100698 4102657 There is no tomorrow!
4108081 4109790 Look, there's just one<br />thing that you gotta remember.
4109875 4111667 We gotta get<br />some speed.
4111752 4114670 You gotta get some flexibility.<br />You gotta get some quickness.
4114755 4115963 You understand?
4116047 4117465 Quickness, endurance,<br />that's the end of it.
4117549 4120176 That's the only thing we gotta<br />concern ourselves with, Rock.
4120302 4123012 All right. Mickey never had me do this.
4124139 4126557 Yeah. Okay,<br />here we go.
4128143 4129435 Ready?
4133607 4134607 Set.<br />Yeah.
4134691 4136150 Go!
4136234 4138819 Come on, come on!<br />Dig, dig, dig!
4138904 4140905 Come on! Come on!
4148663 4150164 Come on!
4151500 4153375 You<br />can't win, Rock.
4154920 4157963 You ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
4159174 4161717 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
4205263 4206930 What's the matter?
4208432 4209766 It's over.
4210309 4211810 It's all over.
4222655 4224781 What's the matter<br />with you?
4260318 4261985 Can I<br />talk to you?
4266658 4267867 I wanna ask you<br />something important
4267951 4269994 and I want you<br />to tell me the truth.
4270871 4272163 What?
4273165 4275041 Why did you come here?
4276335 4278878 I just don't<br />want it no more.
4278962 4282381 If it's over because you<br />want it to be over, I'm glad.
4283091 4284175 I do.
4285594 4289305 It's just, you've never quit<br />anything since I've known you.
4293560 4295686 I don't know what<br />you want me to say.
4295771 4297855 I mean, how?<br />What happened?
4297940 4301025 How did everything that<br />was so good get so bad?
4302027 4304153 What's so bad?<br />Tell me, what?
4304237 4307406 I wrecked everything by<br />not thinking for myself.
4307491 4309659 I mean, why couldn't Mickey<br />tell me where I was really at,
4309743 4310993 right from the start?
4311078 4312703 He didn't have to<br />carry me and lie to me
4312788 4315748 and make me think I was better<br />than I really was when I wasn't.
4315832 4317208 He never lied.
4317292 4319460 Those fights weren't right.<br />They weren't, Adrian.
4319544 4321420 I never fought anybody<br />who was in their prime.
4321505 4323923 There was always some angle<br />to hold on to the title
4324007 4325758 longer than I should have had it.
4325842 4327677 I mean, do you understand<br />what I'm saying here?
4327761 4330471 I understand. But you've gotta<br />understand that he loved you,
4330555 4332348 and that was his job,<br />protecting you.
4332432 4334433 Well, that protecting<br />don't help nothing.
4334518 4335810 It only makes<br />things worse.
4335894 4339355 You wake up after a few years thinking<br />you're a winner, but you're not.
4339439 4340898 You're really a loser.
4340983 4343819 And so we wouldn't have had<br />the title as long. So what?
4343903 4345696 At least it would've been real, Adrian.
4345780 4347030 It was real.
4347115 4349825 Nothing is real if you<br />don't believe in who you are.
4349909 4352411 I don't believe in myself no<br />more. Don't you understand?
4352495 4353870 When a fighter don't<br />believe, that's it.
4353955 4355831 He's finished.<br />It's over. That's it.
4355915 4357582 That's not it!<br />That is it!
4357667 4359084 Why don't you<br />tell me the truth!
4359168 4361294 What are you putting<br />me through, Adrian?
4361379 4362504 You wanna know the truth?
4362588 4364506 The truth is,<br />I don't want to lose what I got.
4364590 4366383 In the beginning, I didn't<br />care about what happened to me.
4366467 4368927 I'd go in a ring, I'd get<br />busted up, I didn't care.
4369012 4370887 But now there's you,<br />there's the kid.
4370972 4372305 I don't wanna<br />lose what I got!
4372390 4374975 What do we have that can't be replaced? What?
4375059 4378103 A house? We got cars. We got money.
4378187 4380188 We got everything<br />but the truth!
4380273 4381857 What's the truth,<br />damn it?
4381941 4384359 I'm afraid, all right?
4384444 4385610 You wanna hear<br />me say it?
4385695 4387821 You wanna break me down?<br />All right, I'm afraid!
4387905 4389906 For the first time in<br />my life, I'm afraid.
4389991 4391450 I'm afraid, too!
4391534 4392909 There's nothing wrong<br />with being afraid.
4392994 4394411 There is.<br />For me there is!
4394495 4395871 Why? You're human,<br />aren't you?
4395955 4398498 Look, I don't know what I<br />am. All I know is I'm a liar,
4398583 4400584 and because of that<br />Mickey ain't here no more.
4400668 4402627 You didn't push<br />him into anything!
4402712 4405380 He was a grown man and<br />he did what he had to do.
4405465 4408884 And you have no right to feel<br />guilty for what happened, you don't!
4408968 4411636 You were a champion. And you<br />did what you were expected to do.
4411721 4414598 You did what I and everybody<br />else thought you should do.
4414682 4417642 And you wanna tell me that those fights<br />weren't real? That you were carried?
4417727 4419061 Well, I don't<br />believe it!
4419145 4420437 But it doesn't matter what I believe.
4420521 4423649 Because you're the one that's gotta<br />carry that fear around inside you.
4423734 4426736 Afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
4426820 4428946 Afraid you're gonna be remembered<br />as a coward,
4429031 4431199 that you're not<br />a man anymore.
4431283 4434535 Well, none of it's true, but<br />it doesn't matter if I tell you.
4434620 4437747 It doesn't matter, because you're<br />the one that's gotta settle it.
4437831 4438915 Get rid of it!
4438999 4440958 Because when all<br />the smoke has cleared
4441043 4443044 and everyone's through<br />chanting your name,
4443128 4444921 it's just gonna be us!
4445005 4446214 And you can't<br />live like this.
4446298 4448216 We can't live like this.
4448300 4450593 Because it's gonna bother<br />you for the rest of your life.
4450677 4453012 Look what it's<br />doing to you now.
4459061 4461979 Apollo thinks you<br />can do it. So do I.
4463148 4465608 But you. You've gotta wanna<br />do it for the right reasons.
4465692 4467485 Not for the guilt<br />over Mickey,
4467569 4470154 not for the people,<br />not for the title,
4470239 4472657 not for money or me,<br />but for you.
4473784 4475785 Just you,<br />just you alone.
4480040 4481833 And if I lose?
4481917 4485378 Then you lose, but at least<br />you lose with no excuses.
4486672 4488464 No fear.
4488549 4491050 And I know you<br />could live with that.
4498809 4500686 How'd you get so tough?
4502856 4504731 I live with a fighter.
4511239 4512906 I really love you.
4520415 4521790 I love you.
4544898 4546857 No, no, no, Rock. No.
4546941 4548650 Just flick it, just flick it. Just flick it.
4555283 4557743 Come on, one more time. Come on!
4568963 4570797 Good. Five more laps.
4573551 4574927 Watch it, watch it,<br />watch it, watch it.
4575011 4576929 There you go, come on.
4605334 4606960 Jab.
4609838 4611881 You got to<br />move it faster.
4617012 4619347 Faster! Faster!<br />Go on. Kick it.
4622393 4623726 Very nice!
4639493 4640660 Move your head.<br />Move your head.
4640744 4642495 Move it.<br />Move your head.
4643122 4645456 That's right, under!<br />Under and over.
4645541 4647709 Up and down.<br />Turn around.
4648168 4649460 That was nice.
4656719 4659471 Come on, pick them up now.<br />On your toes. On your toes.
4659556 4661181 Come on. Come on. Come on.
4661266 4662808 Come on, now. Speed, speed, speed.
4662892 4665477 Faster, faster, faster.<br />Yeah! Good.
4667147 4669231 Ready. Ready.
4676031 4677573 Rocky the fish!
4708355 4709480 Yeah!
4725538 4727081 All right!
4734130 4737050 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br />I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin
4737134 4739386 and we welcome you to Madison Square Garden,
4739470 4742555 a most exciting backdrop for<br />the anxiously awaited rematch
4742723 4745266 Between the former<br />champion, Rocky Balboa
4745351 4747894 and the reigning heavyweight<br />champion, Clubber Lang.
4747978 4751940 We now switch to our remote<br />cameras inside the dressing rooms.
4752024 4755068 Would you care to comment on<br />how you plan to fight Balboa?
4755152 4756236 What's your strategy?
4756320 4757404 Don't need any.
4757488 4760824 Balboa's so predictable and stupid,<br />the man comes straight ahead.
4760908 4763701 He's tailor-made for me<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
4763786 4764953 Just make sure you...
4764995 4767789 That's good... turn them over. Good?
4768374 4770375 How does that<br />look? Okay? Huh?
4771043 4773753 No, I don't hate Balboa,<br />but I pity the fool,
4773838 4777382 and I will destroy any man<br />who tries to take what I got.
4781178 4783388 Remember where<br />you came from.
4784181 4786808 Remember what it<br />took to get you here.
4787601 4790061 And you remember what he<br />did to you last time, right?
4790229 4792188 Since both men<br />are brawlers, Stu,
4792273 4794149 with the edge in power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
4794233 4796276 I would say that<br />the odds are very long
4796360 4798486 against Balboa<br />regaining his title.
4799196 4800905 Now it's your turn.
4801198 4802991 It's your turn, huh?
4804118 4806327 What's your<br />prediction for the fight, then?
4806412 4808371 Prediction?<br />Yes, prediction.
4810875 4811958 Pain.
4812835 4815629 Lang is a brawler who likes<br />to hurt a man to the body.
4815714 4819300 And, you know, Balboa may never<br />have psychologically recovered
4819384 4821927 from that vicious knockout<br />that Clubber laid on him.
4823722 4825055 It's time.
4827184 4828517 Here.<br />What?
4831771 4833814 I want you to wear these.
4836234 4838652 Come on, Apollo,<br />these are
4838737 4841071 the colors that you wore<br />in our first fight together.
4842616 4843741 I can't wear your colors.
4843825 4845117 Just wear it.
4846411 4848370 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
4849581 4851248 Thanks, Apollo.
4851333 4852833 You just<br />make sure you wash them
4852918 4854293 before you bring<br />them back, all right?
4854377 4856086 Will do, will do.
4857464 4858839 Hey, thanks, Apollo.
4858924 4861800 And remember, after this you owe me a favor.
4862969 4864345 What favor?
4864513 4865554 Bill, I have to agree.
4865639 4869642 Toe-to-toe, Lang is utterly<br />devastating and he's much too strong.
4871937 4874355 All right, listen. I just wanna<br />tell you that I'm proud of you.
4874439 4876023 It takes a hell of a man<br />to change, and you did it.
4876107 4877191 You're gonna prove<br />it to them tonight, right?
4877275 4878317 Right.<br />Right.
4878401 4880110 You did good, Apollo.<br />Thanks, Paulie.
4880195 4882238 Okay, let's do<br />it, Paulie.
4883907 4886242 And here comes Rocky,<br />and here comes Apollo,
4886326 4887743 the two former champions.
4887827 4890329 Look at that United States<br />Marine Corps Color Guard there
4890413 4891705 along with the Drum<br />and Bugle Corps.
4891790 4892998 Aren't they magnificent?
4893083 4894918 Tremendous. Take<br />a look at Rocky.
4895002 4897921 Look at the tenseness in his<br />face, the tautness of that body.
4898005 4899381 Boy does he look<br />serious right now!
4899465 4900757 Oh, that he<br />certainly does.
4900841 4902717 And you know, Stu,<br />the word is that
4902802 4905637 this is Rocky's last fight,<br />win, lose or draw.
4905721 4908056 And there he is,<br />the Italian Stallion,
4908140 4910392 Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring.
4910476 4912435 Boy, he looks incredibly thin, doesn't he?
4912520 4915063 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
4915147 4917899 Rocky Balboa, the<br />iron man from Philadelphia!
4917984 4920902 And this crowd is certainly<br />with him tonight. Listen.
4922822 4924990 Balboa doesn't really<br />have any boxing skill.
4925074 4926449 I've never seen<br />a fighter, though,
4926576 4928201 with as much<br />raw determination.
4928286 4930203 Hold it, Stu.
4930288 4932747 And here comes the champion now,<br />Clubber Lang.
4932832 4934833 Listen to this crowd.
4936127 4937669 Take a look<br />at those eyes.
4937753 4941923 I've never seen a guy with<br />such sullen eyes. He is tough.
4942008 4944551 Clubber, go back<br />where you came from!
4946345 4949222 He even belted a spectator<br />on the way in. Did you see that?
4949307 4950432 Look at that man.
4950516 4951558 Boy, awesome.
4951642 4954144 Awesome! Man, he's tough. Look at that.
4954228 4957397 Clubber Lang, the<br />heavyweight champion of the world.
4957481 4958648 Keep it loose,<br />keep it loose.
4958733 4960942 Hey, fool, you ready<br />for another beating?
4961027 4963153 You should've<br />never came back.
4963237 4965947 Don't look at him.<br />Let's just be cool.
4966032 4968158 Hey, boy.
4968242 4970243 Hey, boy.
4970328 4972245 After I crucify him,<br />you're next.
4972330 4974290 Just stay out of<br />my face, chump.
4974374 4975416 Don't turn your<br />back on me, sucker!
4975542 4977043 We got a brawl<br />before the bell!
4977085 4979045 Apollo and Clubber<br />go at it.
4979087 4980963 This ring is<br />ready to explode.
4981048 4982840 The fight about<br />to officially begin
4982924 4984842 but these guys<br />wanna start now.
4984926 4986636 Come on! Let me go! Let me go!
4986720 4987845 That's right,<br />I'm gonna get you!
4987929 4989013 I'm gonna get you!<br />Let him go!
4989097 4990389 Come on!
4990474 4992266 Let him go! I want him! I want him!
4992392 4994310 I thought you said be cool. That was cool.
4994394 4995936 I'm the champ!<br />I'm the champ!
4996021 4997480 I'll beat you<br />like I did last time!
4997564 5000441 You won't have to look to find me. I'm here.
5000525 5004278 Ladies, gentlemen<br />and boxing fans around the world,
5004363 5006906 welcome to Madison<br />Square Garden
5006990 5009992 and tonight's heavyweight<br />championship of the world.
5011536 5012870 Oh, this crowd<br />is ready tonight.
5012954 5018918 Out of the red corner,<br />the challenger, weighing 191 pounds
5020420 5023756 from the fighting<br />city of Philadelphia,
5023840 5027468 the former heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5027552 5034058 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5040440 5042400 I'll tell you something.<br />He has so slimmed down.
5042484 5043693 He looks like a middleweight.
5044736 5049907 Out of the blue corner,<br />weighing 237 pounds,
5050325 5053412 the hard-punching<br />battler from Chicago,
5053496 5057791 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5057875 5060627 Clubber Lang!
5061879 5064089 Referee Lou Filippo.
5064507 5066341 Okay, boys,<br />let's go.
5067635 5069428 We went over<br />the rules yesterday.
5069512 5071012 I'm just going to<br />repeat a few of them.
5071347 5073890 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
5073975 5076893 In case of a knockdown, you<br />go to the corner I tell you to
5076978 5079438 and you stay there until<br />I tell you to come out.
5079522 5081982 Is that understood?<br />Any questions?
5082692 5085902 Okay. Let's go back to<br />your corner now. Let's go.
5085987 5087904 I'm gonna bust you up.
5088656 5089990 Go for it.
5091993 5094953 Well, here we go.<br />The war is on.
5095037 5096621 We're just waiting<br />for the bell.
5096706 5098707 Take my belt off. I'm gonna get that chump.
5098791 5100751 Don't let this bum let you fight his fight.
5100835 5102419 You're the best!<br />You're the best!
5102587 5104045 Here you<br />go, champ.
5105173 5106214 Rhythm and power,<br />rhythm and power.
5107300 5108925 Keep that jab up.<br />Thanks.
5109010 5112053 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5112138 5114389 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
5114515 5116016 Are we ready<br />for round one now?
5116058 5117225 Should be<br />a great fight.
5117310 5119227 And here we go.
5119312 5122564 And he goes right out of his<br />corner after Clubber Lang!
5122648 5125233 He's throwing rights and<br />lefts into Clubber's face.
5125318 5126735 What a start<br />of a fight here!
5126819 5129196 Another jab.<br />Another jab.
5130364 5133117 And another! This is not<br />the Rocky we expected!
5133202 5134535 He looks fantastic.
5134620 5136412 He's fighting more<br />like Apollo Creed.
5139082 5140625 Another right!
5140709 5143753 A right! Look at that,<br />right and left to the head!
5143837 5146130 Clubber Lang doesn't<br />know what's happening right now.
5146215 5147965 He's being stung<br />by this style.
5148050 5149926 Look at the shots<br />he's taking.
5151637 5153054 I can't believe<br />I'm saying this,
5153138 5155640 but he can't corner the<br />fleet-footed challenger.
5155724 5158059 It's absolutely<br />unbelievable!
5159645 5160853 Come on, is that<br />the hardest you can hit?
5160938 5162396 Bring it to me!<br />Come on! Hit me!
5162481 5165525 That right hand is<br />just like a trip hammer.
5169196 5170738 Rock, tie him up! Bring it to me. Come on.
5171907 5173282 Break it up.<br />Get back. Get back.
5173367 5174659 Come on. Get back.
5174743 5177370 Tough first round.<br />Tough first round.
5177454 5180832 It is Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts, right to the head of Lang.
5180916 5181999 Get off! Get off!
5182084 5183626 Now it's Lang<br />coming back!
5183710 5186295 This crowd is<br />going absolutely wild!
5190801 5194178 There's a good left-right<br />combination by Rocky.
5194263 5195304 And a good left hand.
5195389 5196389 Go!
5199643 5202478 This is Rocky<br />Balboa's night.
5211322 5212823 Getting him<br />back to his corner.
5212907 5215909 We've got pandemonium in the<br />ring at the end of round one.
5216077 5217244 They're holding<br />Lang back.
5217328 5218453 Lang wants more.
5218538 5220706 He can't realize<br />that the round is over.
5220790 5223333 He's trying to<br />get back to Rocky.
5223418 5225294 All right, all right,<br />you look great.
5225378 5226712 Just don't get crazy<br />and we're home.
5227964 5230507 I'll kill you, man!<br />The man's strong.
5230592 5233093 Tell me when's the next round. I'm<br />gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!
5233177 5235178 I'm gonna kill him!
5235889 5237556 Now, he's gonna come hard, right? Yeah.
5237640 5239683 You keep crowding him.<br />Don't give him a chance to set.
5239767 5242686 Counter and move. Counter<br />and move. Counter and move.
5242770 5244563 And he had<br />Lang at his mercy.
5244647 5248066 I don't think Lang knew what<br />hit him there in this whole first round.
5248192 5250652 Here we go now.<br />The bell for round two.
5250737 5254823 Now it's Lang coming out for<br />Rocky at the starting of round two.
5256784 5259411 Here he comes back, but Rocky is<br />still landing those rights and lefts.
5259495 5262414 Right now in the center of<br />the ring, a right to the head.
5262498 5264791 Another right to the head.<br />He's really setting him up.
5264876 5266084 A right!<br />Right! Right!
5266169 5267669 Five unanswered shots!
5269005 5270756 Kill him! Kill him!
5275386 5276678 Get out of there!
5276763 5278013 Get<br />back there!
5282477 5284394 All right! All right!
5285605 5286897 - Get him off of him!<br />- Let's go now!
5286981 5289442 Come on, break it up!<br />Break it up!
5289526 5290610 What are you doing?
5290694 5292445 Come on!<br />Come on, Balboa!
5292529 5294113 Come on. I'm gonna<br />give it to you!
5294198 5297784 Get those feet moving! Get<br />your hands up! Come on, Rock!
5297868 5299869 That right<br />hand hurt Rocky again.
5299954 5301788 What a fight!
5302373 5305917 He's got him cornered.<br />Balboa's a little in trouble now.
5310089 5312215 Hold him, damn it!<br />Hold him!
5313676 5315134 Come on, Rocky,<br />come on!
5315219 5316928 This is Clubber's round so far.
5317012 5318888 Lang's taken<br />momentum here.
5320224 5322392 He's railing away<br />at Balboa.
5323894 5326104 And Balboa is down!
5326188 5328982 You think you're bad?<br />Get up. Get up, damn it!
5329066 5330984 Come on! Come on!<br />Five.
5331068 5332443 Can he get up?<br />Can he get up?
5332528 5334195 He's in trouble,<br />but he's up.
5334279 5335905 Six. Seven.
5337866 5340159 Here comes Clubber again.<br />Lang with the left hand.
5340244 5342745 Lang with another<br />left and now a right.
5342830 5345081 A right! Another right!<br />A right! Another right!
5345165 5347291 And down goes<br />Balboa again.
5348877 5349961 Stop the fight.
5350045 5351713 You better<br />stay down.
5352423 5354215 I got some moves<br />if you get up.
5354299 5356509 I got a lot of moves. I<br />got a lot of moves. Come on.
5356593 5359137 Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
5359221 5361347 Come on,<br />come on, fool.
5364268 5366310 You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't so bad.
5366395 5368355 You ain't so bad.<br />Come on.
5368440 5370315 You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't nothing.
5370400 5371650 You must be<br />crazy or something!
5371776 5373736 I'm crazy? Yeah, I may be...<br />You're just a stupid fool!
5373820 5375362 ...but I ain't<br />breathing heavy.
5375447 5377865 He's a fool.<br />He's stupid.
5377949 5380242 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
5380326 5382453 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?
5382537 5384788 Look, it's strategy, that's<br />all. I know what I'm doing.
5384873 5386331 No, you don't know<br />what you're doing!
5386416 5388042 He's gotta come to you.<br />You're the champ.
5388126 5390169 He's nothing.<br />He's mine.
5390420 5392337 You stand toe-to-toe with<br />this bum and he'll kill you!
5392422 5394757 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />there and get their head beat off!
5394883 5396967 Don't... He's getting<br />tired. He's getting tired.
5397052 5400179 Don't go wasting your<br />punches. You're the champ.
5400263 5402056 Don't try to take him out with one punch!
5402140 5403223 Use your head.
5403308 5405726 Now, you wear him<br />down. He's all ours.
5405810 5407603 I know what I'm doing, I<br />swear. I know what I'm doing.
5407687 5409354 Don't tell me<br />what you think!
5409481 5410647 Go out there<br />and do it, Rock.
5410690 5412107 Eye of the tiger.<br />You understand?
5412150 5413400 Yeah.
5413485 5414860 Go out there and<br />knock his head off.
5414944 5417071 He's just a man, Rock.<br />He's just a man.
5417947 5419782 Be more man than him!<br />Go get him.
5419866 5421742 Eye of the tiger!<br />Eye of the tiger!
5421910 5423327 Up and down.<br />Side to side.
5423411 5425537 All right, this is<br />the beginning of round three.
5425622 5427790 Tough rounds to<br />call right now.
5427874 5429500 This is a little<br />slower in the start.
5429584 5431835 It's my round.<br />It's my round.
5431920 5433253 I'm gonna take<br />you this time.
5433338 5437049 I'm gonna take you. You're mine. You're mine.
5437175 5440010 Come on. Come on. I'm gonna<br />get you. I'm gonna get you.
5443181 5446309 And Rocky throws him three rights<br />to the head and a left. He is back.
5446393 5449270 He's your heavyweight.
5451982 5454317 Rock, get out<br />of there! Get out!
5456028 5458530 A sharp left-hand<br />right to the head.
5459365 5461282 Get out of there!
5461367 5462659 Come on.
5462743 5464285 Stick him! Stick him!
5467039 5468790 Come on! Come on!
5469416 5470583 Come on!
5470668 5472377 Again, again!
5472586 5474504 He's getting killed.<br />Oh, no, no, no.
5474588 5476506 He's not getting killed,<br />he's getting mad!
5476590 5478299 Come on, whole world's watching.<br />Knock me out.
5478384 5480552 Come on, knock me out.
5480678 5483638 Come on, harder. Hit me<br />hard. Hit me harder. Come on!
5486934 5489018 No!
5490729 5492438 Get out of there!
5494775 5495942 Rocky!
5498737 5500947 Come on, Rock.<br />Hands up, Rock.
5501740 5502824 Yeah.
5504076 5505577 My mother hits harder<br />than that. Come on.
5505661 5507203 A little harder. A little harder, champ.
5507288 5508788 In the face. Come on.
5508873 5510456 Again, come on, champ.
5510541 5513084 Again, come on, champ. You ain't so bad!
5513169 5517088 You ain't nothing!<br />You ain't nothing!
5517965 5520341 Rocky! Rocky!
5535066 5536984 I might believe<br />the strategy now.
5537068 5540362 He's making Clubber Lang miss<br />now. You see how he drew him in?
5540447 5542281 Now Rocky's<br />throwing the punches!
5545035 5547286 Look at that! He's lifting<br />him right off the canvas
5547370 5550122 with those powerful<br />punches to the ribs.
5554252 5557463 He's coming. He's completely<br />psyched-out this guy.
5558423 5561133 Lang has got to be<br />confused by all of this.
5563220 5566972 Look at the condition Balboa is in<br />right now. Look at the condition.
5567057 5569058 Somehow he's roared back.
5573438 5576607 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
5577234 5579026 Harder punches!<br />Now!
5579110 5581362 What a comeback by Balboa!
5588745 5590371 Come on. Come on.
5591498 5593290 Come on. Come on.
5594834 5596710 Come on. Come on!
5598630 5599880 Yeah!
5606597 5608682 The place<br />has gone bananas!
5608766 5610767 It's a tremendous comeback!
5610851 5612143 Get up!
5612228 5615438 Five. Six. Seven.
5615523 5616690 Seven.
5616774 5618942 Eight. Nine.<br />Nine.
5619026 5621695 Ten. You're out!
5623072 5625073 The new heavyweight<br />champion again!
5625157 5627617 He's down on the floor in ecstasy!
5627994 5630620 Bowing, praying there,<br />beating the floor!
5630705 5634124 And there he is, the new<br />heavyweight champion of the world,
5634208 5636960 Rocky Balboa!
5639338 5641214 Rocky is exhausted!
5643718 5645260 We did it!
5646512 5649889 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the winner by knockout...
5650224 5651891 Are you all right?
5652059 5654227 Never better.<br />Never better.
5654312 5658481 Once again the heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5658566 5664195 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5672755 5674331 Come on, come on!<br />We made a deal.
5674415 5676624 I know, but this is extremely crazy.
5676709 5677709 Yeah, it's mentally<br />irregular, right?
5677793 5678793 Yeah.
5678878 5680253 But it makes all<br />the sense in the world.
5680338 5681671 You owe me a favor.
5681756 5684592 I know, but when did<br />you think of this?
5684676 5686427 About three years ago.
5686511 5688346 This is very crazy, Apollo.
5688430 5689513 Look, Stallion.
5689598 5692475 Now look, when you won that last<br />fight, you won by one second.
5692559 5694185 You beat me by one<br />second. One second.
5694269 5696270 That's very hard for a man<br />of my intelligence to handle.
5696355 5699815 Is it? But didn't you say after I beat<br />you, you learned how to live with it?
5699900 5701776 I lied.<br />Oh, you lied.
5703111 5705404 So now you just gotta<br />prove it to yourself?
5705489 5706489 Just for myself.
5706573 5708699 No TV, no newspapers, just you and me.
5708784 5710201 Nothing.<br />Just you and me.
5710285 5711660 Age before beauty.
5711745 5712953 Anything you say,<br />Stallion.
5713038 5714705 I'll do all the work,<br />okay.
5715248 5717208 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow
5717292 5719543 because you ain't as young<br />as springtime anymore.
5719628 5722004 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, Stallion.
5722089 5724173 Oh, yeah? Well, how you gonna do that?
5724257 5725800 You taught me<br />everything you know.
5725926 5727468 Almost everything.
5727552 5729512 You gotta remember now, you fight great,
5729596 5732098 but I'm a great fighter.<br />You ready?
5732808 5734058 Absolutely.
5734142 5735309 All right.
5735394 5738854 You know, Stallion, it's too<br />bad we gotta get old, huh?
5740982 5743150 Just keep punching, Apollo.
5744986 5746737 Wanna ring the bell?
5746988 5748322 All right.
5748490 5749949 Ding, ding.
5751660 5753327 Come on, Stallion.
5754246 5756414 Come on. Come on.
5756498 5759583 Boy, you really move<br />good for an older guy.
5760752 5762337 You're looking good,<br />Stallion.
5762422 5763964 I taught you well.
5764048 5766007 I think you<br />taught me too good.
5766092 5768051 Looking fly.<br />Look out now.
5768136 5769761 No, no.<br />You don't want any of this.
5769846 5771513 Come on. Come on.
5772223 5774057 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
5774183 5775725 Come on, watch yourself. Ready?
