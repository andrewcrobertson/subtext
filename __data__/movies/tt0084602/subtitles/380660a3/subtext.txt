1358062 1360462 See you next year.<br />Thank God.
1360631 1362698 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, pretty good.
1362766 1366533 - Good match.<br />- Why'd you get so crazy on me out there?
1366601 1368702 That's the name<br />of the game.
1368770 1371971 While you're still calm, can<br />we get that polaroid together?
1372139 1374071 Yeah, sure.
1374138 1378107 Adrian, come on over here.<br />My wife Adrian, my kid.
1378175 1380442 That's Thunderlips. Al, would<br />you do that? That hurt.
1380509 1382678 Okay,<br />that's all right.
1382745 1386380 You know, sometimes charity<br />really hurts. [Laughs]
1389717 1392417 And this Pinocchio,<br />he told a lie, you see,
1392485 1394418 and his nose started<br />growin' real big.
1394486 1397388 Why didn't his ears grow?<br />[Laughs] I don't know.
1397456 1400523 I didn't write the story.<br />Are you fighting again?
1400592 1403325 Today? No, I don't plan<br />on fightin' today.
1403393 1405827 Promise? Promise. Definitely I promise.

1418704 1421973 [Rocky] And the father bear, he says,<br />"somebody's been sleepin' in my bed."
1422039 1423974 And the little<br />kid bear said,
1424041 1427242 "somebody's been sleepin'<br />in my bed, and there she is."
1427310 1429243 Thereby he pulls<br />back the covers...
1429311 1433080 And thereby exposing her<br />to the, you know, public, see?
1433147 1435215 Come on, eat your cereal<br />before it sinks.

1439352 1442121 Busted for trespassin', and<br />got 30 days in the clink.
1442147 1443478 That's real nice, Paulie.

1457297 1461299 Oh, thank you, Paulie. Don't give<br />the kid any beer, all right?
1461367 1465269 Okay, we gotta go. And, Paulie, don't<br />take him to the track, all right?

1628053 1631855 to hurt this sport<br />that has been...

1675620 1680055 Politics, man. This country wants to<br />keep me down, keep everybody weak.
1680057 1681674 They don't want a man like<br />me to have the title,
1681700 1683249 because I'm not a puppet<br />like that fool there.
1683292 1685326 You know,<br />you've got a big mouth.
1685394 1687995 Why don't you come out and<br />close it, Balboa? Come on!
1688062 1691764 - Anytime.<br />- The guy's crazy. Don't listen to him.
1691832 1693506 If the little man don't<br />wanna come to me,
1693532 1695325 then I'll come to you<br />and lay out the truth.
1695367 1698635 I am ranked number one. One!<br />That means I'm the best.
1698703 1701637 But this bum is takin' the easy<br />matches, fightin' other bums.
1701705 1703972 I'm telling you<br />and everybody here...
1704040 1706809 I'll fight him anywhere,<br />anytime, for nothin'.

1715381 1717216 He fight them setups.<br />What?
1717284 1719150 You're a disgrace<br />to this sport!
1719218 1722286 Shut up, old man! You and that chump<br />don't know where I had to come from.

1808247 1811816 I'm goin' on<br />a permanent vacation.
1811883 1814284 What are you talkin' about?<br />We got one more fight.
1814352 1818020 No, not we.<br />You.
1818088 1820421 Why are you doin' this?
1823892 1826626 I said, why are<br />you doin' this?
1826694 1828962 Because you can't win, Rock!
1829029 1832163 This guy'll kill you to death<br />inside of three rounds!
1832231 1834799 You're crazy.<br />What else is new?
1834867 1838034 He's just another fighter. No,<br />he ain't just another fighter.
1838102 1841570 This guy is a wreckin' machine,<br />and he's hungry.
1841638 1844372 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
1844439 1846707 What are you talkin' about?<br />I've had ten title defenses.
1846774 1849075 That was easy. What do you mean, easy?
1849143 1852011 They was handpicked!
1854113 1856882 Setups? No, they weren't setups.
1856949 1860683 They was good fighters, but they<br />wasn't killers like this guy.
1860751 1864020 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
1883367 1885367 Geez, Mick.
1886937 1889137 Why'd you<br />do it?
1891040 1896108 Because the beating that you got from<br />Apollo should've killed you, kid.
1896176 1898110 It didn't.
1898178 1902547 It was my job to keep you winnin'<br />and to keep you healthy.
1907451 1911253 You really don't think I<br />got nothin' left, do you?
1911320 1913988 Well, Rock, let's--
1914056 1916823 well, let's<br />put it this way.
1916891 1920860 Now, three years ago,<br />you was supernatural.
1920928 1924295 You was-- you was hard,<br />and you was nasty...
1924363 1928298 And you had this<br />cast-iron jaw.
1928366 1930299 But then,
1930367 1932802 the worst thing<br />happened to you...
1932870 1935804 That could happen<br />to any fighter.
1935872 1938372 You got civilized.
1943744 1945844 Oh, don't worry, kid.
1945912 1948613 You know,<br />presidents retire,
1948681 1952515 generals retire,<br />horses retire.
1952584 1954650 Man o'war retired.
1954718 1957887 They put him<br />out to stud.
1957955 1960956 That's what you<br />should've done, retire.
1964459 1967460 I can't retire<br />knowin' all this, Mick.
1967527 1970596 Oh, don't push it. Well,<br />you been carryin' me.
1970663 1974298 We don't need it. You've<br />been carryin' me, though.

2273510 2276411 [Rocky hums circus tune]
2276479 2279347 [Announcer] Good evening, everyone.<br />Along with bill Baldwin,
2279414 2282615 I'm stu nahan, and we welcome you to<br />tonight's heavyweight title fight,
2282683 2285185 which may prove to be<br />the most memorable of all.
2285251 2289420 For tonight is the champion's final and<br />perhaps most difficult title defense.
2289488 2291622 Rocky, do you feel you're in<br />the best shape of your career?
2291690 2293623 Oh, yeah, absolutely.<br />I feel real good.
2293691 2296792 He's a deadly weapon. He's one<br />of a kind, and he's gonna do it.
2296860 2298627 Clubber, do you think<br />you're as fast as Balboa?
2298695 2301129 I'll do my talkin' in the ring!<br />Clubber, dance for us.
2301197 2303597 [Reporters shouting questions]
2303664 2306966 You better get outta here!<br />I wanna be alone!
2307034 2309901 Will you retire after this fight?<br />This is the last one.
2309969 2313304 After this, me and Mick are finished.<br />This is definitely the last one.
2313372 2316374 <i>Clubber-- you're parasites and leeches!<br />Get outta here!</i>
2316441 2319642 <i>What will you do<br />after tonight?</i>
2319710 2323544 I'm not sure. Maybe join<br />the circus, eh, Mick?
2323612 2325712 Yeah.<br />Have some fun.
2325780 2328581 Come on,<br />take your robe off!
2328649 2332167 <i>[Shouting] I told you<br />to get outta my face!</i>
2332235 2334810 With us this evening is<br />the former heavyweight
2334836 2336863 champion of the<br />world, Apollo creed.
2336905 2338489 Do you have any predictions<br />on this fight?
2338556 2340491 How do you see this fight<br />going tonight?
2340558 2342992 I feel its strength would<br />have to go to the challenger,
2343060 2345994 while experience and the world's hardest<br />head would have to go to Rocky Balboa.
2346062 2347995 And you know<br />I know about that.
2348062 2351165 Now remember, Rock.<br />Don't trade with this guy.
2351233 2353099 Take your time,<br />wear him down,
2353167 2355600 but don't stand toe-to-toe with him.<br />Mm-hmm.
2355668 2358836 This punk's never been<br />15 rounds before.
2358904 2361705 Take him good. Take him good. Okay. I will.
2361772 2363706 That's it.
2363774 2365741 So I predict that<br />the champ's gonna take it.
2365808 2368144 Now wait a minute. Do you really think<br />the champion can hit that hard?
2368211 2370845 Why do you think I'm<br />sittin' out here with you?

2468149 2471049 Can't I get my breath? Is that<br />against the rules? Mick--
2471118 2474018 - will you please get a doctor, Paulie?<br />- He's on his way.
2474086 2476098 Mick, I can't go out there<br />and fight like this.

2664120 2666287 Dead meat.
2670759 2674260 [Nahan] This is not gonna<br />be a fight of finesse.
2674328 2676260 These are two guys that<br />really throw punches.
2676286 2677588 This could end with one punch.
2677630 2680130 Chump's scared. Yeah. Hang him up.

2924772 2928207 Mr. Balboa, time is important. We must<br />get him to the hospital immediately.

2981879 2984214 Everything's gonna<br />be okay, Mick.
2984282 2986215 Yeah.<br />We did it.
2986283 2988849 Mick, you just gotta<br />get to the hospital.
2988917 2991286 You're not as young as<br />you used to be, okay?

3304058 3306558 <i>That's not<br />the way to do it.</i>
3306626 3309293 Who's that?
3309361 3313096 Why don't you hit it straight?<br />Step into it.
3313164 3315865 Apollo?
3315932 3317900 Right.
3317968 3321235 I waited at your house for about an hour,<br />and your wife said you might be here.
3321303 3323786 What are you<br />doin' here?
3323854 3325854 Business.
3327491 3331593 If the papers knew we were talkin'<br />like this, they'd think we was crazy.
3331660 3333594 Why you?
3333661 3336563 'Cause I'm the best, and you need<br />somebody to teach you different.
3336630 3341066 Why? To be honest with you, I don't<br />think you could pull it off without me.
3341134 3343374 You still didn't give<br />me the answer, Apollo.
3343400 3344594 What's the real reason?
3345837 3349506 Listen.<br />It's quiet, isn't it?
3349574 3351507 When you're retired,<br />it's too quiet.
3351575 3354375 <i>I mean, we're too young<br />to retire, anyway.</i>
3354443 3356522 Besides, with the right<br />touch, I could promote
3356548 3358537 this thing into the<br />biggest gig of all time.
3358580 3360514 It'd be bigger<br />than ours.
3360582 3365383 <i>Heaven knows, I-I don't mind Bein'<br />involved with large numbers, right?</i>
3366652 3369320 I don't need this<br />no more. I--
3369387 3373456 <i>i don't want this no more.<br />Look, man.</i>
3373524 3377459 When you beat me,<br />I hurt all over,
3377527 3381028 and I didn't wanna know from nothin'<br />or nobody, not even my kids.
3381096 3383896 <i>Hell, every fighter<br />knows that hurt.</i>
3383964 3387099 <i>And we get sick inside tryin' to<br />live with it, so don't back off now.</i>
3387167 3390335 <i>Make it right for yourself, or<br />you'll be sorry you didn't.</i>
3390402 3395205 We held the greatest title<br />in the whole world, babe.
3395273 3398807 <i>You lost that fight, Rock,<br />for all the wrong reasons.</i>
3398875 3400808 <i>You lost your edge.</i>
3400876 3402960 All right,
3403027 3406796 I know your manager dying<br />had you all messed up inside.
3406863 3410499 <i>But the truth is,<br />you didn't look hungry.</i>
3410567 3413767 Now when we fought,
3413835 3416603 you had that eye of the tiger,<br />man, the edge.
3416670 3419372 And now you gotta get it back,<br />and the way to get it back...
3419440 3422007 Is to go back to the beginning,<br />you know what I mean?
3422075 3424008 [Chuckles]
3424076 3426578 Maybe we could win it<br />back together.
3428079 3430646 Eye of the tiger, man.
3433749 3435884 Why'd you have<br />to come here?
3436752 3440387 I have a plan.<br />Get back, man.
3442289 3444389 You got me<br />curious.
3446225 3448559 You got me curious,<br />Rock.
3449695 3452629 [Sighs]
3452697 3457132 Clubber, do you accept the challenge<br />for a rematch with Balboa?
3457200 3460468 I reject the challenge, because<br />Balboa is no challenge.
3460535 3462970 But I'd be more than happy<br />to beat up on him some more.
3463037 3464972 Always said<br />he was nothin'.
3465039 3467673 I can't wait<br />to see this bum fall.
3467741 3471175 What do you think of him being<br />trained by Apollo creed? Apollo who?
3471243 3473427 You talkin' about that<br />old fool, Apollo creed?
3473494 3475995 Shucks, one has-been teachin' another.<br />Just keep talkin', pal.
3476063 3478731 That's all Apollo been doin'. Been<br />runnin' off at the mouth lately.
3478799 3481667 And when I see him, I'm gonna<br />close it for him. All right.
3481734 3484835 When will the match take place?<br />The sooner, the better.
3485070 3487671 I'm the champion of the world. Ain't<br />nothin' can be done about that.
3488039 3490039 I can't be beat,<br />and I won't be beat.
3490106 3492041 This time I'm gonna<br />train even harder.
3492108 3493975 There won't be<br />no quick knockdowns.
3494043 3497010 I'm gonna torture him.<br />I'm gonna crucify him real bad.
3497078 3499912 [Sportscaster]<br />Hard words from a hard man.
3499980 3505116 The odds against Balboa making a<br />comeback at 34 are very long indeed.
3505184 3508485 Can he do it?<br />Most experts doubt it.
3508553 3513855 Balboa was a fine champion, but his<br />time has passed. I wish him luck.
3513923 3516792 Don't listen to it,<br />Rocky.
3516859 3519594 <i>No, do listen to it,<br />Rock.</i>
3519661 3523396 When this is over, a lot of folks are<br />gonna owe you an engraved apology.
3523464 3525631 [Sportscaster<br />continues]
3525699 3529734 And you're gonna owe me a big favor.<br />What favor?
3529802 3532402 When it's over, hmm?
3532470 3534604 [Sportscaster<br />continues]
3537007 3541409 [Paulie] Rocko, come on! We're<br />gonna be late at the airport!
3541477 3543944 Let's go. Think we forgot anything?
3544012 3546646 I think we have it all.<br />Maybe another sweater.
3546714 3550048 California's not that cold.<br />It's great, great. A scorcher.
3550116 3552549 Okay, listen. I want you<br />to be a good boy, okay?
3552618 3554885 Okay. And don't give anybody a hard time.
3554953 3557887 Okay.<br />Give me a kiss.
3557955 3560472 Mmm.<br />Yeah.
3565660 3568328 We'll call when we land.<br />Yeah, we'll call.
3572398 3575499 You gonna be a good boy?<br />All right.

3920378 3923742 <i>[Yelling continues] Shut<br />up, you sterno bums!</i>
3923768 3924937 <i>I'll squash ya!</i>
3924980 3927081 There's decent people<br />tryin' to sleep!
3927150 3930217 Shut up, you honky scum<br />bastard mother.
3930285 3933620 Who needs this sick place?<br />I don't.
3933687 3935837 <i>[Drunken chatter]</i>
3935839 3937689 No class.
3940592 3943160 Damn, that clubber's strong.
3943227 3946128 Fifteen rounds<br />is a long time.
3946163 3950498 You gotta<br />put him away early.
3950566 3956202 I figure with the pace we gotta set, Rock<br />can last maybe seven or eight rounds.
3956270 3959238 Then we'll be<br />out of steam, man.
3959305 3962806 <i>Got to put him away early.</i>
3965343 3968778 [Gasps]<br />At least the water's hot.
3970980 3975049 Well, we never<br />really had a honeymoon.
3975117 3977117 It's not so bad.
3978418 3982187 We've been in worse places.
3982255 3985690 [Commentator's voice] In the corner.<br />Rocky's in trouble in round two.
3985758 3988110 He takes a right. Another right!<br />He's been cut.
3988136 3989017 Rocky's been cut!
3991327 3993328 <i>[Apollo] Come on, Rock.<br />Come on, come on now.</i>
3994596 3997098 Let's go.<br />You gotta get tougher.
3997166 3999833 Think smooth. Think smooth.<br />Bounce, bounce, bounce.
3999901 4002835 Toes, toes. On your toes, Rock.<br />On your toes.
4002903 4005336 On your toes.<br />On your toes!
4005404 4007572 Push yourself, Rock!<br />Concentrate.
4007640 4009674 Let's move it, Rock.<br />Move it now.
4009741 4011775 Come on, Rock.<br />Come on.
4012176 4015110 [Duke] Have fun with it.<br />[Apollo] That's it.
4015178 4018147 That's it. Easy, easy, easy. Smooth.
4018214 4021547 On the toes. Don't push it. Let it come.
4021615 4023548 There it is.<br />It'll come.
4023616 4025549 Just takes time, baby.<br />Just takes time.
4025617 4027551 [Duke] Come on. Move the head.
4027619 4029552 Move your head.<br />Up and down.
4029620 4031855 Come on. Come on.<br />Slip now. Up and down.
4031923 4036091 In and out.<br />Inside. Inside, baby.
4036159 4038459 Side to side. Move your head.<br />Watch him now.
4038527 4040795 Remember,<br />he's got two hands.
4045399 4047599 Damn, man!<br />What the hell you doin'?
4047667 4052236 This guy will knock you<br />on your ass!
4052304 4054237 Come on, Rock,<br />it's not a game.
4054305 4058040 You wanna live in the hospital<br />for five weeks this time?
4058108 4060641 You thought I was tough.<br />This chump will kill you!
4060709 4064411 All right. Come on. Get your<br />head on your shoulders, man.
4064478 4066579 Think about the fight.<br />Think about the fight.
4066647 4069648 Clubber Lang, and he's trying<br />to hurt you, Rock. Okay.
4069716 4072550 Okay, here it comes. Jab.<br />He's jabbin'. He's jabbin'.
4072618 4074274 He's tryin' to hurt you!<br />You gotta fight him.
4074300 4075076 You gotta move!
4077272 4078615 [Commentator's voice]<br />He's taking a beating!
4078641 4079447 He's up against the ropes.
4079489 4082324 He's back into the corner.
4085961 4088528 He's hooked ya!<br />He's hooked ya!
4088595 4091131 Damn, Rock!<br />Come on!
4091199 4094233 What's the matter with you? Tomorrow.
4094301 4097501 Let's do it tomorrow. There is no tomorrow!
4097569 4100237 There is no tomorrow!
4100305 4103439 There is no tomorrow!
4108277 4110623 There's just one thing<br />that you gotta remember.
4110649 4111871 We gotta get some speed.
4111913 4116014 You gotta get some flexibility. You gotta<br />get some quickness. You understand?
4116082 4120918 Yeah. That's the only thing we gotta<br />concern ourselves with, Rocky.
4120986 4122986 Mickey never had me<br />do this.
4124288 4127923 Yeah. Okay.<br />Here we go.
4127991 4129991 Ready?
4133394 4136196 Set. Go!
4136264 4138297 Come on, come on!
4138299 4140698 Speed, speed!<br />Come on. Come on!
4148405 4151506 Come on!
4151574 4155158 [Mickey's voice]<br />You can't win, Rock.
4155160 4159162 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
4159380 4161680 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
4164550 4168052 [Rocky's voice wailing]
4205546 4207813 What's the matter?
4207881 4212317 It's over.<br />It's all over.
4212385 4214385 [Sighs]
4222425 4224325 What's the matter<br />with you?
4260419 4262419 Can I talk to you?
4266756 4269824 I want to ask you something important,<br />and I want you to tell me the truth.
4271026 4274961 - What?<br />- Why'd you come here?
4276463 4278697 I just don't want it<br />no more.
4278765 4281967 If it's over because you want it<br />to be over, I'm glad.
4283034 4285735 I do.
4285803 4289805 It's just you've never quit<br />anything since I've known you.
4293641 4295576 I don't know<br />what you want me to say.
4295643 4297910 I mean, what happened?
4297979 4300545 How did everything that was<br />so good get so bad?
4300613 4304148 What's so bad?<br />Tell me. What?
4304483 4307550 I wrecked everything<br />by not thinking for myself.
4307618 4311087 Why couldn't Mickey tell me where I<br />was really at right from the start?
4311154 4313255 He didn't have to carry me and<br />lie to me and make me think...
4313323 4315823 I was better than I really was,<br />when I wasn't.
4315891 4319559 - He never lied.<br />- Those fights weren't right.
4319627 4321560 I never fought anybody<br />who was all in their prime.
4321628 4326731 There was always some angle to hold onto<br />the title longer than I should've had it.
4326799 4328732 Do you understand what I'm sayin'?<br />I understand.
4328800 4332735 But you've gotta understand that he loved<br />you, and that was his job, protecting you.
4332803 4335904 But protecting don't help nothin'!<br />It only makes things worse.
4335972 4339474 You wake up after a few years thinking<br />you're a winner, but you're not.
4339541 4343910 You're really a loser. And so we wouldn't<br />have had the title as long. So what?
4343978 4345911 It would have been real!
4345979 4346780 It was real!
4346806 4350006 Nothing is real if you don't<br />believe in who you are!
4350049 4353984 I don't believe in myself no more. And<br />when a fighter don't believe, that's it!
4354052 4356452 He's finished!<br />It's over. That's it.
4356520 4359088 That's not it! Tell me the truth!<br />That is it!
4359156 4362457 What are you putting me through, Adrian?<br />You wanna know the truth?
4362525 4364658 I don't wanna lose what I got.
4364726 4366631 In the beginning I didn't<br />care what happened to me.
4366657 4368086 I'd go in the ring,<br />I'd get busted up.
4368129 4370829 I didn't care! But now there's you.<br />There's the kid.
4370897 4375099 I don't wanna lose what I got! What do<br />we have that can't be replaced? What?
4375167 4378201 A house. We got cars.<br />We got money.
4378269 4381937 We got everything but the truth.<br />What's the truth, damn it?
4382005 4384472 I'm afraid! All right?
4384540 4386792 You wanna hear me say it?<br />You wanna break me down?
4386818 4387832 All right, I'm afraid.
4387875 4389809 For the first time in my life,<br />I'm afraid.
4389877 4392978 I'm afraid too. There's nothin'<br />wrong with being afraid.
4393047 4396014 For me there is. Why?<br />You're human, aren't ya?
4396081 4398015 I don't know what I am.
4398083 4400651 All I know is I'm a liar, and because<br />of that, Mickey ain't here no more.
4401002 4405354 You didn't push him into anything! He was<br />a grown man and he did what he had to do.
4405422 4408190 And you have no right to feel guilty<br />for what happened. You don't!
4408258 4411659 You were a champion, and you did<br />what you were expected to do.
4411726 4414494 And you did what I and everybody<br />else thought you should do.
4414562 4416830 And you wanna tell me that<br />those fights weren't real?
4416856 4417821 That you were carried?
4417864 4420498 Well, I don't believe it! But it<br />doesn't matter what I believe,
4420566 4424701 because you're the one that's gotta<br />carry that fear around inside you,
4424769 4426936 afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
4427003 4431239 Afraid you're gonna be remembered as a<br />coward, that you're not a man anymore.
4431307 4434808 Well, none of it's true. But it<br />doesn't matter if I tell you.
4434876 4439079 Because you're the one that's<br />gotta settle it. Get rid of it.
4439146 4443114 Because when all the smoke has cleared and<br />everyone's through chanting your name,
4443182 4445116 it's just gonna be us.
4445184 4448218 And you can't live like this.<br />We can't live like this.
4448286 4450252 'Cause it's gonna bother you<br />for the rest of your life.
4450320 4452821 Look what it's<br />doing to you now.
4459094 4463129 Apollo thinks you can do it.<br />So do I.
4463197 4465697 But you gotta wanna do it<br />for the right reasons.
4465764 4470267 Not for the guilt over Mickey. Not<br />for the people, not for the title.
4470335 4473769 <i>Not for money or me.<br />But for you.</i>
4473837 4476771 Just you. Just you alone.
4479975 4483376 <i>And if I lose?<br />Then you lose!</i>
4483444 4488480 But at least you lose<br />with no excuses. No fear.
4488547 4491116 And I know you<br />can live with that.
4498921 4501556 How'd you get so tough?
4501624 4505292 I live with a fighter.
4511530 4513530 I really love you.
4520469 4522470 I love you.

4734188 4736221 [nahan] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
4736289 4739990 I'm stu nahan along with bill Baldwin, and<br />we welcome you to Madison square garden,
4740325 4741926 [chanting]<br />Rocky!
4742277 4743810 A most exciting backdrop<br />for the rematch
4743836 4745519 between the former<br />champion, Rocky Balboa...
4745562 4748096 And the reigning heavyweight<br />champion, Clubber Lang.
4748164 4752300 We now switch to our remote cameras<br />inside the dressing rooms.
4752367 4756401 Would you care to comment on how you plan<br />to fight Balboa? What's your strategy?
4756469 4759304 Don't need any. Balboa's<br />so predictable and stupid.
4759330 4760964 The man comes straight ahead.
4761006 4763673 He's tailor made for me,<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
4763741 4766643 That's good.<br />Bend 'em over, huh?
4766711 4770946 That's good. How does that look? Okay?
4771013 4773881 No, I don't hate Balboa.<br />But I pity the fool,
4773949 4777883 and I will destroy any man who<br />tries to take what I got.
4780854 4784255 Remember<br />where you came from.
4784323 4787707 Remember what it took<br />to get you here.
4787775 4790443 And you remember what he did<br />to you last time. Right?
4790511 4793044 [Baldwin] Since both men are brawlers, Stu,
4793313 4794932 with the edge and power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
4794958 4796439 I would say that the<br />odds are very long...
4796481 4798982 Against Balboa<br />regaining his title.
4799049 4803151 Now it's your turn.<br />It's your turn, huh?
4804253 4806487 What's your prediction<br />for the fight, then?
4806555 4809756 Prediction?<br />Yes. Prediction.
4810758 4812692 Pain.
4812759 4815827 Lang is a brawler who likes<br />to hurt a man to the body.
4815894 4820130 And Balboa may never have psychologically<br />recovered from that vicious knockout...
4820198 4822199 That clubber laid on him.
4824000 4826000 It's time.
4827203 4829603 Here.<br />What?
4832073 4834073 I want you to wear these.
4836377 4838844 Come on, Apollo.<br />These are, uh,
4838911 4842012 the colors that you wore<br />in our first fight together.
4842080 4846182 I can't wear your colors. Just wear 'em.
4846250 4849618 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
4849686 4854421 Thanks, Apollo. You just make sure you<br />wash 'em before you bring 'em back.
4854489 4856590 Will do. Will do.
4856658 4859024 And thanks, Apollo.
4859092 4862360 And remember, after this<br />you owe me a favor.
4862428 4864628 What favor?
4864863 4869432 Bill, I have to agree. Toe-to-toe, Lang<br />is devastating, and he's much too strong.
4869500 4873235 [Rocky breathing deeply] All right. Listen.
4873302 4874635 I just want to tell you<br />that I'm proud of you.
4874661 4875595 Takes a hell of a man to change,
4875637 4877572 and you're gonna prove it<br />to 'em tonight, right?
4877639 4879906 Right. You did good, Apollo.
4879974 4882107 Thanks, Paulie. Okay. Let's do it, Paulie.
4884428 4888279 [Nahan] Here comes Rocky and<br />Apollo, the two former champions.
4888381 4891014 [Baldwin] Look at that united<br />states marine corps color guard,
4891082 4892948 along with<br />the drum and bugle corps.
4893016 4894617 Magnificent. [Nahan] Tremendous.
4894885 4898019 Take a look at Rocky. Look at the<br />tenseness, the tautness of that body.
4898087 4900187 Boy, does he<br />look serious.
4900255 4904373 [Baldwin] He certainly does. The word<br />is that this is Rocky's last fight.
4904392 4907293 Win, lose or draw. There he<br />is, the Italian stallion.
4907728 4910661 Rocky Balboa,<br />climbing into the ring.
4910729 4913147 Boy, he looks incredibly thin,<br />doesn't he?
4913214 4915399 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
4915467 4918351 Rocky Balboa,<br />the iron man from Philadelphia!
4918369 4922970 This crowd is certainly<br />with him tonight. Listen.
4923038 4925539 Balboa doesn't really have<br />any boxing skill.
4925607 4928374 I've never seen a fighter though<br />with as much raw determination.
4928441 4931777 Oh, hold it, stu. Look behind me.<br />Here comes the champion now.
4931844 4934211 Clubber Lang.<br />Listen to this crowd.
4935580 4937780 [Nahan]<br />Take a look at those eyes.
4937782 4941666 I've never seen a guy with<br />such sullen eyes. He is tough.
4941734 4946521 Clubber, go back<br />where you came from!
4946922 4950156 [Baldwin] He even belted a spectator<br />on the way in. Did you see that?
4950425 4952641 Look at that man.<br />Awesome, awesome.
4952709 4954992 <i>He's tough. Look at that.<br />Clubber Lang,</i>
4955060 4957261 the heavyweight champion<br />of the world.
4957329 4959663 Keep it loose-- [Clubber] Hey, fool!
4959731 4963399 You ready for another beatin'?<br />You should've never came back.
4963466 4965867 Don't look at him.<br />Let's just be cool.

4999732 5000817 [Announcer] Good evening...
5000860 5004094 Ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans<br />around the world. Take this robe off!
5004162 5006864 Welcome to Madison<br />square garden...
5006964 5010933 And tonight's heavyweight<br />championship of the world!
5011000 5014101 [Nahan] This crowd is ready tonight.<br />[Announcer] The red corner:
5014169 5017104 [Crowd chanting] Rocky! Rocky!<br />The challenger,
5017172 5020856 weighing 191 pounds.
5020924 5023976 From the fighting city<br />of Philadelphia,
5024043 5027545 the former heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
5027613 5030113 the Italian stallion,
5030181 5034383 Rocky Balboa!
5040121 5042555 [Nahan] I'll tell you,<br />he has so slimmed down.
5042623 5044090 He looks like a middleweight.<br />[Bell dings]
5044157 5046558 Out of the blue corner,
5046626 5049927 weighing 237 pounds,
5049995 5053563 the hard-punching battler<br />from Chicago,
5053631 5057900 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5058001 5061002 Clubber Lang!<br />[Crowd booing]
5061070 5064371 Referee Lou fillipo.
5064438 5067907 Okay, boys.<br />Let's go.
5067975 5071342 We went over the rules yesterday.<br />I'm just gonna repeat a few of 'em.
5071410 5074044 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
5074112 5076779 In case of knockdown, you go<br />to the corner I tell you to,
5077014 5079616 and you stay there<br />until I tell you to come out.
5079683 5082818 <i>Is that understood?<br />Any questions?</i>
5082886 5084919 <i>Okay. Let's go back<br />to your corner now.</i>
5084987 5088187 I'm gonna bust you up.
5088255 5090256 Go for it.
5091925 5094826 [Nahan] Well, here we go. The war is on.
5094894 5096911 We're just waiting<br />for the bell.
5096979 5098896 Take my belt off.<br />I'm gonna get that chump.
5098963 5102632 Don't let this bum let you fight his fight.<br />You're the best!
5103000 5105333 You're the champ.<br />[Mutters]
5105401 5109102 Rhythm and power. Rhythm and power.<br />Then jab him. Thanks.
5109170 5111704 [Crowd chanting]<br />Rocky! Rocky!
5114174 5117742 [Nahan] Are you ready for round one now?<br />Should be a great fight.
5117810 5119743 [Baldwin] And here we go.<br />[Nahan] Rocky Balboa.
5119811 5123012 And he goes right out of his corner.<br />He goes right after Clubber Lang!
5123180 5125119 He's running right to left,<br />into clubber's place.
5125145 5126306 What a start of a fight here!
5126348 5131518 [Baldwin] Another jab. Another jab.<br />And another!
5131586 5133519 Oh! This is not the Rocky<br />we expected.
5133587 5135937 <i>- Looks fantastic.<br />- He's dancing like Apollo creed!</i>
5139025 5141793 [Nahan] Another right.<br />[Apollo] Stay in there!
5141860 5143794 Look at that right<br />and left to the head!
5143861 5146395 [Baldwin] Clubber Lang doesn't<br />know what's happening right now.
5146462 5148430 He's being stunned<br />by this style.
5148498 5151566 Look at the shots<br />he's taking.
5153201 5155769 But he can't corner<br />the fleet-footed challenger.
5155837 5158470 [Baldwin]<br />It's absolutely unbelievable.
5158538 5159839 [Nahan]<br />Absolutely!
5159907 5162757 Come on, you oversized hick.<br />Come on! Hit me!
5162824 5165826 [Nahan] That right hand is<br />just like a trip hammer.
5169213 5171546 - Rock, tie him up!<br />- [Clubber] Bring it to me. Hit me!
5171614 5173782 Break it up.<br />Step back. Step back.
5173850 5177418 [Nahan] Tough first round.<br />Tough first round!
5177484 5180486 And it is Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts right to the head of Lang.
5180554 5183522 <i>- Get off! Get off!<br />- [Baldwin] Now it's Lang coming back.</i>
5183590 5186524 This crowd is going<br />absolutely wild.
5191362 5194963 [Nahan] There's some left-right<br />combinations by Rocky.
5195031 5196847 A good left hand!
5200235 5202035 [Baldwin]<br />This is Rocky Balboa's night!
5207774 5209874 [Bell dings]
5209942 5212342 It's a full-time operation<br />getting him back to his corner.
5212409 5215311 [Nahan] We've got pandemonium in<br />the ring at the end of round one.
5215379 5219247 [Clubber yelling] They're holding him back.<br />Lang wants more.
5219249 5221750 I'll get you, fool! He can't<br />realize that the round is over.
5223751 5225485 All right. All right.<br />You looked great.
5225553 5229188 - Just don't get crazy and we're home.<br />- I'll kill you, man!
5229256 5230822 The man's strong.
5230890 5234258 I'm gonna kill him.<br />I'm gonna kill him!
5236027 5237994 Now, he's gonna come hard. Right? Yeah.
5238062 5239929 You keep crowding him. Don't<br />give him a chance to set.
5239997 5244732 Counter and move. [Nahan]<br />He had Lang at his mercy.
5244799 5248468 [Baldwin] I don't think Lang knew<br />what hit him there this first round.
5248770 5251036 [Bell dings] Here we go now.<br />The bell for round two.
5251104 5253805 Now it's Lang coming out<br />stronger in round two.
5255775 5257707 But it's Rocky now<br />in his corner.
5257776 5259805 Rocky is still landing<br />rights and lefts. He's
5259831 5261769 using rights now in the<br />center of the ring.
5261812 5263880 A right to the head.<br />Another right to the head.
5263947 5266248 He's really setting him up.<br />Right. Right. Right.
5266315 5268849 Five unanswered shots!
5268917 5271751 - Kill him! Kill him!<br />- [Crowd chanting] Rocky! Rocky!
5275288 5277256 - Get outta there!<br />- [Clubber] Get back there!
5282459 5285128 All right! All right!
5285196 5289363 Get off. Break it up!<br />Break it up.
5289431 5292616 - What are you doing?<br />- Come on! Come on, Balboa!
5292801 5295560 <i>[Clubber] Come on! I'm<br />gonna give it to you!</i>
5295586 5296994 <i>Get your hands up!</i>
5298222 5299871 Ooh! That right hand<br />hurt Rocky again.
5299939 5301739 <i>What a fight!</i>
5301807 5306143 [Baldwin] He's got him in the corner.<br />Balboa's got trouble now.
5309979 5313714 Hold him, damn it.<br />Hold him!
5313782 5317150 - Come on, Rocky! Come on!<br />- [Baldwin] This is clubber's round so far.
5317218 5320719 Lang is taking momentum here.<br />He's holding on Balboa!
5320787 5323988 [Crowd shouting]
5324056 5327291 [Baldwin] And Balboa is down!<br />Can he make it up?
5327358 5329893 - Get up, damn it!<br />- Come on!
5329961 5333796 Five, six... can he get up?<br />He's in trouble.
5333863 5337199 But he's up.<br />Seven--
5337333 5339766 Rocky's gonna--<br />here comes clubber again!
5339834 5342501 Lang with the left hand. Lang with<br />another left hand. Now a right!
5342837 5345770 Another right. A right!<br />Another right!
5345838 5348739 Down goes Balboa again!
5348807 5350407 Stop the fight!
5350475 5352242 Six!
5352310 5356628 I got some more for you! Get up!<br />I got a lotta moves.
5356696 5359196 [Baldwin] Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
5359348 5361349 Come on!<br />Come on, fool.
5363852 5367453 Ain't so bad. Ya ain't so bad.<br />Ain't so bad!
5367520 5370788 [Bell dings]<br />You ain't so bad.
5370857 5372422 [Clubber]<br />You must be crazy!
5372490 5375525 You're just a stupid fool! I may be<br />stupid, but I ain't breathing heavy.
5375860 5377793 He's a fool!
5377861 5380229 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
5380363 5382647 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?
5382714 5384679 It's strategy, that's all.<br />I know what I'm doin'.
5384705 5385491 No. You don't know.
5385533 5390302 He's gotta come to you. You the champ.<br />He's nothin'. He's mine!
5390370 5392471 You stand toe-to-toe,<br />and he'll kill you.
5392822 5394805 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />there and get your head beat off!
5394873 5396806 Don't--<br />he's gettin' tired.
5396874 5400376 Don't go wastin' your punches.<br />You're the champ!
5400443 5403045 Don't try to take him out<br />with one punch. Use your head.
5403380 5405480 Now, you wear him down.<br />He's all ours! Yeah.
5405547 5407647 I know what I'm doin'.<br />I swear I know what I'm doin'.
5407715 5411550 Don't tell me what you think! Go out<br />there and do it, Rock. Eye of the tiger.
5411886 5413552 You understand?<br />Yeah.
5413620 5417089 Go out there and knock his head off.<br />He's just a man, Rock.
5417390 5420724 Be more man than him! Go get him!<br />Eye of the tiger!
5420893 5424560 <i>Eye of the tiger! [Duke] Up and down.<br />Side to side.</i>
5424627 5427696 [Baldwin] Round three. Tough<br />rounds to call right now.
5427764 5429530 This is a little slower<br />than the start.
5429598 5432332 It's my round.
5432400 5434734 So I'm gonna take you<br />this time.
5434802 5436802 You're mine.
5436870 5440105 Come on. Gonna get ya. Come on.
5441807 5445042 [Nahan] And Rocky throws him<br />three rights to the head.
5445109 5448544 Then a left. He is back.<br />These are heavyweights.
5452214 5455449 - Get out! Get out!<br />- Take that!
5455517 5457851 [Nahan]<br />A sharp left!
5459186 5461520 Get outta there!
5462756 5465022 Stick him! Stick him!
5467341 5470292 Come on, come on.<br />Come on, clubber.
5470360 5472495 Again, again!
5472562 5476464 He's gettin' killed. Oh, no, no. He's<br />not gettin' killed. He's gettin' mad.
5476532 5479366 Come on. Whole world's<br />watching. Knock me out.
5480534 5483636 Come on, harder!<br />Can't you hit hard?
5483704 5486921 [Roaring]
5486989 5489407 No!
5490341 5492609 Get outta there!
5494577 5497178 Rocky!
5498897 5501648 Come on!<br />Get into him, Rock!
5501716 5504117 Yeah!
5504184 5506385 My mother hits harder than that.<br />Come on. A little harder.
5506452 5508920 A little harder, champ!<br />In the face. Come on.
5510122 5512689 Again. Come on, champ.<br />You ain't so bad.
5512724 5515825 You ain't nothin'.<br />You ain't nothin'!
5517428 5520629 Rocky! Rocky!
5533772 5536640 [Nahan] I see it now. I might<br />believe the strategy now.
5536707 5539008 He's making Clubber Lang<br />miss now.
5539076 5542478 You see how he drew him in?<br />Now Rocky's throwing punches.
5542546 5545513 But look at the punches<br />that Lang is taking!
5545581 5547823 Look at that. He's lifting<br />him right off the
5547849 5550240 canvas with those forceful<br />punches to the ribs!
5553219 5555587 Where does he get that strength from?<br />He's coming.
5555955 5558455 He's completely psyched out<br />this time!
5558523 5562058 Lang is confused<br />by all of this.
5562125 5566161 Obviously the condition that<br />Balboa is in right now, bill.
5566228 5568262 Look at the condition.
5573100 5576569 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
5576636 5579471 <i>- All to the body! Harder punches!<br />- Come on!</i>
5588878 5590579 Come on! Come on.
5590646 5594849 Come on. Come on.
5594916 5597249 Come on. Come on.
5607625 5610392 [Nahan]<br />This place has gone bananas!
5610460 5611794 Get up!
5611862 5614629 Five, six,
5614697 5617898 seven, eight,
5617966 5620265 nine, ten.
5620333 5622735 You're out!
5622803 5624803 [Crowd cheering, shouting]
5625004 5627821 Yea! [Nahan] He's on the floor in ecstasy!
5627889 5630607 Bowing, praying there,<br />beating the floor!
5630674 5633942 And there he is, the new<br />heavyweight champion of the world!
5634010 5636444 Rocky Balboa!
5639147 5643099 Rocky is exhausted!
5643166 5645885 [Rocky]<br />We did it!
5645952 5649487 [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the winner by knockout.
5649522 5651889 Are you all right?
5651956 5655825 Never better.<br />Never better.
5655893 5658593 [Announcer] The heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5658661 5660428 the Italian stallion,
5660496 5664697 Rocky Balboa!
5664764 5667766 [Crowd cheering]
5672137 5674704 [Apollo]<br />Come on. We made a deal!
5674772 5678740 I know, but this is extremely crazy.<br />Yeah. Mentally irregular.
5678808 5680742 Yeah. But it makes all<br />the sense in the world.
5680810 5684812 You owe me a favor. I know, but,<br />uh, when'd you think of this?
5684879 5688614 About three years ago. Oh,<br />this is very crazy, Apollo.
5688682 5692750 Look, stallion. When you won that<br />last fight, you won by one second.
5692818 5696686 You beat me by one second. That's very hard<br />for a man of my intelligence to handle.
5696754 5700089 Is it? Didn't you say after I beat<br />you, you learned how to live with it?
5700157 5703291 I lied. Oh, you lied. [Laughs]
5703359 5705994 So now you just gotta prove<br />it to yourself, right?
5706062 5709096 Just myself. No TV, no newspapers.<br />Just you and me.
5709164 5712098 Nothin'. Just you and me.<br />Age before beauty.
5712166 5715367 Anything you say, stallion. All right.<br />I'll do all the work. All right?
5715435 5717368 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow,
5717436 5719736 'cause you ain't as young<br />as springtime no more.
5719804 5722238 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, stallion.
5722306 5725841 Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?<br />You taught me everything you know.
5725976 5728776 Almost everything.<br />You gotta remember now.
5728844 5732379 You fight great, but I'm a great fighter.<br />You ready?
5732447 5736582 Absolutely.<br />You know, stallion,
5736649 5740418 it's too bad<br />we gotta get old, right?
5740486 5744321 Aw, just<br />keep punchin', Apollo.
5744389 5746322 Wanna ring the bell?
5746390 5751126 All right.<br />Ding, ding.
5751194 5754061 Come on, stallion.
5754129 5756062 [Laughs]<br />Come on. Come on.
5756130 5760165 Boy, you really move good<br />for an older guy.
5760233 5763468 You're lookin' good, stallion.<br />I taught you well.
5763535 5767269 I think you taught me<br />too good. You can fly.
5767337 5772140 Look out now. You don't<br />want any of this. Come on.
5772208 5774241 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
5774309 5776242 Come on. Watch yourself. Are you ready?<br />[Bell dings]
