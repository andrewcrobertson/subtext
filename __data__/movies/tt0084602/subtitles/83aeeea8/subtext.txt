43382 44716 Creed doesn't know where he is.
44800 46385 It's blind instinct.
48262 50180 But now it is Creed coming back.
50264 51598 Creed with the left hand!
51682 53392 What's keeping<br />these two guys up?

70826 72578 It's Creed! Now it's Balboa!
72661 73745 Now it's Creed!
73829 75706 And now a tremendous<br />left by Rocky.
75789 78166 They're standing dead in the<br />center of the ring, toe-to-toe.
96435 97561 One.
100689 101732 Two.
101815 103734 Creed will retain the title.
103817 107946 If neither gets up, it's a draw,<br />and Creed will win the title.

267314 271610 It's the eye of the tiger,<br />it's the thrill of the fight
271693 275822 Risin' up to the<br />challenge of our rival
276114 280285 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
280535 287292 And he's watchin' us all<br />in the eye of the tiger
290754 294132 Face to face, out in the heat
295175 298053 Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
299304 302808 They stack the odds<br />till we take to the street
302891 306603 For we kill with<br />the skill to survive
306978 311316 It's the eye of the tiger,<br />it's the cream of the fight
311399 315570 Risin' up to the<br />challenge of our rival
315862 320200 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
320283 324788 And he's watch in"<br />us all in the eye
324871 327999 Of the tiger
336049 339177 Risin' up, straight to the top
339261 342013 Have the guts, got the glory

383930 386057 The eye of the tiger
392439 395400 The eye of the tiger.
396526 399738 I want Balboal! I want Balboal!
399821 402532 Hear that, old man? You<br />tell Balboa I'm coming for him!
402616 404951 Nobody can beat me!<br />You tell him what I said!
405035 406912 And he's next!<br />I'm gonna kill him!
406995 409623 Nobody can stop me!<br />You tell Balboa that!
409706 411791 I'm coming after him!<br />You tell him!
411875 413043 I want a shot at the title.
413126 415378 If Balboa's got the guts<br />to meet me in the ring,
415462 416504 or anywhere else.
416588 419674 My whole life's been directed<br />towards this here title and nothing else.
419758 421635 I live alone and I train alone.
421718 423887 I'll win the title<br />alone. I want him.
423970 425597 He can't duck me forever.
425680 427557 He can run, but he can't hide.
427641 430936 Well, another southpaw,<br />heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa,
431019 433146 doesn't seem to be worried<br />about much these days.
433229 435440 He's just defended his<br />title for the 10th time,
435523 437067 and now he's even<br />agreed to take on
437150 438944 the world heavyweight<br />wrestling champion
439027 441488 in a sort of charity benefit,<br />with all the proceeds
441571 443281 to go to a local<br />youth foundation.
443365 445241 Now, I'll have to<br />give him credit.
445325 447285 Mr. Balboa manages to stay busy.
447369 448620 He's a true sportsman.
448703 451206 And it looks like the number<br />one contender, Clubber Lang,
451289 453291 will have to continue to<br />play the waiting game.
453375 455919 But that should be<br />a great, great match up.
456002 458380 Hey, Paulie, take it easy, okay?
458755 461424 Awesome.<br />Introducing the newest...
461508 463468 Hey, you going?
463551 466763 Hey, hey. Don't forget to<br />give Rocky my best, huh?
467222 469849 You know, I've been<br />coming here years.
470392 474437 How about you giving<br />me, Paulie, your best once?
475230 476982 Take it easy, Paul.
478108 479651 Hey, hey, Paulie.
479734 481528 Hey, Paulie, you heard me?
481611 485448 Hey, when you see the Rock,<br />tell him the boys all said, "Hey!"
526448 527991 40 thousand.
532537 534289 Nice try. Nice try.
535415 537083 I got another one.
592680 593848 Paulie.
598812 600396 You want to hear I owe you?
600480 601773 You, I owe nothing.
601856 604150 No, you don't owe me nothing.
604234 606361 So what do you want I should do?
606444 607695 My sister ain't here?
607779 608905 She's home.
608988 612700 You know, me and her used<br />to be tight until you come in.
612784 615328 I raise her,<br />she don't come down.
615411 617747 She don't know about this.
617831 619749 You and her can go<br />to hell, you know that?
619833 622293 Hey, watch your mouth, Paulie.
622377 624629 You gonna whack me?<br />I don't sweat you.
624712 626297 I don't sweat you. Come on.
626381 628609 Oh, come on, Paul, why don't<br />you screw your head on right.
628633 630260 No, it ain't my head.
630343 632595 Your freaking head is<br />the one on wrong.
632679 635140 Yeah? Well, what did I do?
635223 636933 What'd you do? Nothing.
637016 638643 For yourself, oh, nice.
638726 640812 Look, you fixed<br />your face up handsome.
640895 641980 Nice clothes.
642063 643898 What did you do for<br />Paulie? Anything?
643982 645984 Three years, did<br />you get me a job?
646067 650572 Look at this. You gave me a<br />lousy, stinking Ex-Lax watch. This!
651447 652490 Hey, Paulie.
652574 653616 What?
653700 655577 What? There, that's right.
655660 657328 No, leave it down!
657412 659706 It never kept good time anyway.
660915 662226 You know, you forget<br />when you were a punk
662250 664836 and those guys used to laugh<br />at you because you were So jive.
664919 666838 Who used to whack them bums out?
666921 668715 They laughed at both of us.
668798 670425 No one laughed at me.
671426 673428 Tell me. Who fixed you<br />up with your first woman?
673511 675430 Me, Paulie! I was responsible!
675513 677348 She was pregnant.
677432 680435 So what? You was<br />no prize either.
681102 683521 You know, I always<br />give you. I give you.
683605 687483 What do you do? You buy a new<br />house, you move Mick in, right?
687567 690987 Did you ask me? Is there<br />something the matter with me?
692155 693995 I got feelings, you know?<br />This ain't cardboard.
695116 697285 Everybody's got them, Paulie.
697660 699287 The hell with everybody.
699370 701289 No, maybe it's<br />the hell with you.
702123 703791 I don't wanna listen<br />to this crap.
703875 705686 Come on, you talk like<br />everybody owes you a living.
705710 706711 Shut your mouth!
706794 709964 Look, nobody owes nobody<br />nothing. You owe yourself.
710048 711424 You're wrong! Friends owe!
711507 713051 Friends don't owe.
713134 714928 They do because they want to do.
715011 717639 Shut your freaking mouth.<br />You been keeping me down!
717722 718806 Down?
719974 723186 You know, you're like a crazy<br />brother to me. You really are.
723269 724997 So I want to tell you<br />something. This is coming
725021 726290 straight from the heart, Paulie.
726314 727899 And I mean this.
727982 731152 You ain't down,<br />and you ain't a loser.
731903 735573 You're just a jealous, lazy bum.
736741 739244 Okay, I'm gonna<br />break your mouth.
739661 741871 I'm gonna bust your mouth up!
753049 754676 Can I have a job?
758012 760056 All you had to do was ask.
765478 767272 You punch pretty good.
767355 769232 Think so? Superb.
772026 773361 It cost a lot, huh?
773444 774737 Yeah, a few bucks.
775196 776823 Got an extra one?
780076 781703 Any trouble with Paulie tonight?
781786 783538 Nah, nothing unusual.
784205 786708 Are you really gonna fight<br />that wrestler? They're so big.
786791 789085 That's all right, it'll be fun.
789877 792380 You mind if I<br />serenade you a while?
794215 796134 Come on, it's your part.<br />What are you doing?
796217 797343 Come on. You can do it.
797427 798511 No.
799887 801448 Come on, Rocky, you're<br />gonna wake the baby.
801472 803850 Adrian, come on,<br />let's do a duet.
807562 810565 No, no. That's good,<br />but it's not "doe, doe."
810648 813401 It's "doo, doo, doo, doo."
815862 817071 That's good, darling.
817155 819407 I've been told
822201 825204 By people and they all
827081 828958 Say they'd take me back
829042 831586 Take me back like before
835381 836841 What's the matter?
836924 839093 I don't know any more<br />of that composition.
839177 840511 Hmm.
840595 841679 Maybe we're lucky.
841763 843306 Yeah. Maybe we're very lucky.
843389 844766 Very lucky. Hmm.
852273 853793 Well, howdy,<br />howdy, howdy, sports fans.
853858 856861 This is Dennis James with<br />Jim Healy down here at ringside.
856944 859197 Tonight we have a most<br />unlikely match for you.
859280 861240 The boxer against the wrestler,
861324 863659 with all the proceeds<br />going to charity.
863743 865078 What's your feelings<br />about a boxer
865161 866472 against a wrestler<br />in the same ring?
866496 869707 Well, you know what the<br />age-old theory is, that the wrestler,
869791 871918 once he grabs that boxer,<br />that's all she wrote.
872001 874462 What the hell goes<br />on inside your head?
874545 875963 Anything normal functions?
876130 877548 Yeah, there's a few,<br />there's a few.
877632 880218 I don't think so. Because<br />to fight a creature like this,
880301 882929 you gotta have about 100<br />pounds of brain damage.
883012 885848 I seen wrestlers that<br />was bigger than dinosaurs.
885973 888393 You ever fight a dinosaur,<br />kid? No, not lately.
888476 890853 They can cause<br />a variety of damage.
890937 892063 Oh, yeah?
892146 894899 The wrestling champion of the<br />world is now entering the arena.
894982 896734 I tell you, he is quite a sight.
896818 898736 All decked out in red.
898820 900363 Why are they carrying him?
900446 901823 He's walking.
908121 910498 I'm coming after you, Balboa.
911207 912417 Let's call it off.
912500 913918 Oh, come on, it's for charity.
914001 916087 You're wearing your<br />anatomy out for charity.
916170 918756 Nobody else does<br />this much for charity.
918840 920466 Bob Hope would.
920550 921884 That's true.
927223 929600 Rocky, you better call Bob Hope.
937316 939735 To all my love slaves out there,
940653 944907 Thunderlips is here<br />in the flesh, baby!
944991 946367 Oh, my God!
946868 951873 The ultimate male versus<br />the ultimate meatball.
953666 955460 Boy, he is a monster.
955543 958296 How much would you take<br />even to get in the ring with him?
958379 960339 Would you<br />like to start at Fort Knox?
960423 963759 In the white corner,<br />an incredible sight.
965052 967221 Standing nearly seven feet,
968431 971184 weighing 390 pounds.
972685 974395 Large, ain't he? The undisputed
974479 975706 wrestling champion<br />of the world...
975730 979150 That's the biggest<br />arm in the world!
979233 983779 A man who calls himself<br />“the ultimate object of desire,”
984864 987450 “the mountain of molten lust."
987533 991078 The one, the only Thunderlips!
994499 997710 You're all trash!<br />You're all trash!
997835 1001047 You're all trash!<br />You're all trash!
1004342 1006469 The slugger from Philadelphia...
1007762 1010765 You'd better shut up!
1011933 1013935 I'll break him in hallf.
1014435 1015853 How much do you think he eats?
1015937 1018189 About 202 pounds.
1018272 1020983 Weighing 202 pounds,
1021067 1024153 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
1024237 1026656 Rocky Balboa.
1027156 1031077 Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1033496 1035289 Come to the center<br />of the ring, please.
1035373 1037166 Okay, come on, Mick.
1045132 1047093 All right, you guys,<br />you know this is for fun,
1047176 1049971 so take it easy and<br />give them a good show.
1051430 1055601 Listen, after the match, how about<br />we get a Polaroid together, okay?
1057061 1058771 You're in trouble!
1059480 1061941 He got me mad. I'm gonna<br />break him in half like this.
1062024 1063818 Come on,<br />Rocky, you can take him.
1063901 1066320 Seems like lately, everybody<br />wants to beat me up.
1066404 1068739 This is<br />entertainment. It's fun and games.
1068823 1071492 Stay away, make faces,<br />move around the ring.
1071617 1073536 - Got it, kid? All right.<br />- He is the ring.
1076247 1078749 I get nervous<br />every time he does that.
1083754 1087300 Whoa. You move pretty fast<br />for a big guy, you know that?
1087383 1089152 Listen, why don't we just<br />move around a little bit?
1089176 1090612 You know, like,<br />give them a good show.
1090636 1092722 First I'll chase you<br />and you chase me, okay?
1092805 1094515 How's that? All<br />right? I'll go easy.
1094599 1096225 Here you go. That okay?
1096350 1098161 Stay away from him!<br />Does that hurt? You all right?
1098185 1099604 Don't miss.
1099687 1101897 How's that, okay? Not bad, huh?
1104692 1106110 Come on, meatball. Come on.
1107278 1108321 Hey.
1111282 1113826 Think it's all fake,<br />meatball? All fake!
1113909 1116621 Thunderlips has gone<br />absolutely berserk.
1118539 1120374 Run for your life!
1120458 1122043 Blast off, meatball.
1129759 1133471 Get up, boy! Come on, meatball,<br />get some of this right here!
1139101 1141520 Rocko, remember<br />the neighborhood!
1142688 1144190 Get out of his way!
1144273 1146734 No, no, no! Not yet,<br />not for the meatball.
1146817 1148069 I'm not done with him yet, boy.
1148152 1152114 If I can't break your spirit, I<br />sure enough can break your back.
1155201 1156952 Is Daddy having fun?
1157036 1158412 Of course.
1163876 1166003 Somebody hand me a hatchet.
1167088 1168506 Holy smoke!
1168923 1172093 Here we go,<br />baby! Lights out, meatball!
1176430 1179517 Oh, my God! Balboa<br />is really in pain.
1179600 1182311 No one can believe the<br />superhuman strength of Thunderlips.
1184063 1185439 I am the man.
1185523 1186774 Stop him, will you?
1186857 1188484 You want this punching bag?
1188567 1189610 Adrian!
1189694 1191654 Rocky! Then you got him!
1191737 1193197 Catch me!
1193280 1198703 That's incredible! Balboa<br />was just heaved clear into the fifth row!
1198786 1201122 Now the fans are outraged, too.
1202498 1206210 Now you got me mad! I'm gonna<br />drag him down the aisle like a dirty rag!
1206293 1208170 You weakling, Balboa.
1209463 1211549 Take it easy. Take it easy!
1212508 1214176 What is it, Mickey? You okay?
1214260 1215260 It's my heart.
1215302 1217346 The security guards<br />are rushing out to stop this.
1217430 1220349 People are flying<br />everywhere! Teeth are flying!
1220474 1221726 Cut my gloves off.
1221809 1223811 What, you finished?
1223894 1225980 Come on, cut my gloves off!
1227273 1230735 That place is a zoo! This<br />place has turned into a zoo!
1230818 1232111 This is very, very...
1232194 1234572 Want me to get<br />a doctor? You sure?
1234655 1236282 The girls have<br />gotten into it now.
1236365 1238159 They're getting beat up, too.
1240828 1242955 Where are you going,<br />you fool? I'll be right back.
1243038 1245291 You're a maniac! Come back here!
1245374 1247084 What are you doing?
1247168 1248461 Come back here!
1248544 1250379 Come on! You!
1250463 1253257 Get out of my way,<br />worms! I'm coming up!
1255968 1257595 Come on! Come on!
1262558 1264977 All right, Thunderlips,<br />break it up! Break it up!
1265060 1267188 No choking! No choking!
1270024 1271567 Paulie, don't!
1274487 1276363 No, I don't sweat you.
1285080 1286832 Hang on there, kid!
1288459 1290169 How do you like it, huh?
1290252 1292046 You're kind of cute!
1292463 1293464 I don't need this.
1293547 1296050 Rocky is<br />out-and-out strangling him.
1296175 1298636 Rocky hanging on<br />like a bull terrier.
1298719 1301722 Now he's got him<br />in a stranglehold.
1301806 1304099 Rocky! Rocky!
1309980 1311398 The body!
1316403 1318239 Knock his block off!
1326247 1327998 Timber!
1330709 1334171 It's unbelievable!<br />Rocky actually did it!
1334255 1336632 The human skyscraper has<br />been thrown out of the ring!
1337883 1340803 All right,<br />that's it, that's it. Time is up.
1343764 1347935 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have a draw. A draw.
1349728 1352857 Thank you all for attending<br />this 12th annual charity match
1352940 1355484 between the Italian<br />Stallion, Rocky Balboa,
1355568 1358028 and Thunderlips,<br />the Ultimate Male.
1358112 1360406 See you next year. Thank God.
1360489 1362783 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, pretty good.
1363158 1364660 Good match.
1364743 1366871 Hey, why'd you get so<br />crazy on me out there?
1366954 1368998 That's the name of the game.
1369081 1370559 Well, listen, while<br />you're still calm,
1370583 1372501 can we get that<br />Polaroid together?
1372585 1373878 Yeah, sure.
1373961 1375713 Adrian, come on over here.
1375796 1378048 My wife, Adrian. My kid.
1378132 1380009 That's Thunderlips.<br />Would you do that?
1380092 1382636 That hurt.<br />Okay, that's all right.
1382761 1385598 You know, sometimes<br />charity really hurts.
1390019 1392313 And this Pinocchio,<br />he told a lie, you see,
1392438 1393981 and his nose started<br />growing real big.
1394064 1396609 ROCKY<br />JR.: Why didn't his ears grow?
1396692 1398986 I don't know. I didn't<br />write the story there.
1399069 1400487 Are you fighting again?
1400571 1403240 Today? No, I don't<br />plan on fighting today.
1403324 1404325 Promise?
1404408 1406368 Promise. Definitely, I promise.
1406452 1407828 Good, I like you here.
1407912 1409413 Yeah? Well, I like being here.
1409496 1410664 Are you getting hungry?
1410789 1412291 Huh? You want<br />some breakfast? Yeah.
1412416 1413709 What do you want,<br />Wheaties? Yeah.
1413792 1415377 What are Wheaties? Champions!
1415461 1417421 Breakfast of what?<br />Champions! Champions.
1418923 1422051 And the father bear, he says,<br />"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed."
1422134 1425804 And the little kid bear said,<br />"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
1425888 1427264 "and there she is."
1427348 1429099 Thereby, he pulls<br />back the covers,
1429183 1433103 and thereby exposing her<br />to the, you know, public, see?
1433187 1435187 Come on, eat your cereal<br />before it sinks. Hurry up.
1435230 1437608 Then what happened<br />to Goldilocks?
1437691 1439276 Happened to her?<br />I'm not exactly sure.
1439360 1441820 Busted for trespassing and<br />got 30 days in the cooler.
1441904 1443405 Oh, that's real nice, Paulie.
1443572 1445115 That's nice to tell the kid.
1445199 1448911 Rocky. Rocky,<br />the car is waiting.
1448994 1450287 Go ahead. You guys better go.
1450371 1451872 Be a good boy, now.
1451956 1453457 We'll have a fun time,<br />me and the kid.
1453540 1454540 All right.
1454583 1457211 Mrs. Stallion, you<br />almost look pretty good.
1457294 1459171 Oh, thank you, Paulie.
1459713 1461590 Don't give the kid<br />any beer, all right?
1461674 1465094 Okay, we got to go. And Paulie,<br />don't take him to the track, all right?
1465177 1466637 How you doing, Mick?
1466720 1467930 Pretty good.
1469473 1471892 Now, we got a<br />problem in the seventh.
1492496 1495874 Whatever happened to them<br />quiet, tender moments, huh?
1513308 1515811 Thank you. Thank you,<br />one and all.
1516103 1520232 Every once in a while, a person<br />comes along who defies the odds.
1520983 1526071 Who defies logic and<br />fulfills an incredible dream.
1527031 1530325 On behalf of all the<br />citizens of Philadelphia
1530409 1533495 and the many who have been<br />touched by your accomplishments
1533579 1535706 and your untiring participation
1535789 1538459 in this city's many<br />charity functions,
1538542 1542212 it is with tremendous honor<br />that we present this memorial
1542296 1545007 which will stand<br />always as a celebration
1545132 1547885 to the indomitable<br />spirit of man.
1548510 1552347 Philadelphia salutes its<br />favorite son, Rocky Balboa!
1564735 1566028 It's beautiful.
1566111 1568363 Definitely a thing of beauty.
1568989 1571575 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1571658 1574078 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1574161 1576622 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1576705 1579083 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1579166 1581543 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1581668 1584046 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1584129 1585506 Thank you.
1589676 1591428 Thank you very much.
1596183 1599853 I don't know, what do you<br />say to something like this?
1602523 1604399 About three years ago,
1605484 1610614 this city really took<br />me inside, you know?
1613700 1617996 And I want to thank you<br />very much for that. I really do.
1619331 1621208 And I've been thinking that...
1621291 1624795 I wasn't gonna bring this<br />up, but I might as well, now.
1625546 1629508 I would never do anything<br />to hurt this sport
1629591 1633720 that has been<br />so really good to me.
1634638 1639017 I've been talking it over with<br />my wife and my manager,
1640727 1642479 and we think that...
1643355 1646733 It's really hard to do<br />this. I feel like a bum.
1647651 1650571 I'm thinking maybe<br />it's time that I should
1651446 1655951 step down, maybe, and retire.
1656034 1659496 No! No! No!
1659580 1661999 No, you can't do that, Rocky.
1662082 1663458 Getting out while you can?
1663542 1666170 Don't give this sucker<br />no statue. Give him guts.
1666253 1668005 I told you I wasn't going away.
1668088 1669756 You got your shot,<br />now give me mine.
1669840 1671508 Why don't you get<br />the hell out of there!
1671633 1673343 Shut up, old man.<br />I ain't going nowhere.
1673427 1675905 Why don't you tell all these nice<br />folks why you been ducking me?
1675929 1678682 Politics, man. This country<br />wants to keep me down.
1678765 1679892 Keep everybody weak.
1679975 1681494 They don't want a man<br />like me to have the title,
1681518 1683438 because I'm not a puppet<br />like that fool up there.
1683478 1685522 You know, you've got<br />a big mouth, you know.
1685606 1688609 Why don't you come down<br />and close it, Balboa? Come on!
1688692 1689943 Anytime.
1690027 1691987 That guy's crazy.<br />Don't listen to him.
1692070 1693548 The little man don't<br />wanna come to me,
1693572 1695550 then I'll come to you<br />people and lay out the truth.
1695574 1697451 I am ranked number one. One!
1697534 1698744 That means I'm the best.
1698827 1701830 But this bum is taking the easy<br />matches, fighting other bums.
1701914 1703665 I'm telling you<br />and everybody here
1703749 1706168 I'll fight him anywhere,<br />anytime, for nothing.
1706335 1709796 Fight him, Rock! Fight him!
1709880 1711649 But you people ain't never<br />gonna see that happen
1711673 1712966 because he's gonna retire.
1713050 1715719 You see? He don't<br />fight no real man.
1715802 1717346 He fights them setups. What?
1717429 1719264 You're a disgrace to the sport.
1719348 1720700 Shut up, old man!<br />You and that chump
1720724 1722434 don't know where<br />I had to come from.
1722517 1724397 Balboa, your family's<br />doing real nice, ain't it?
1724436 1726605 You call yourself a<br />fighter? Prove it now.
1726688 1728482 Give me the same chance.
1728565 1730525 The way he's been<br />ducking me is a disgrace.
1730609 1732736 If he ain't no coward, why<br />don't he fight me, then?
1732819 1734422 I can't listen to any more<br />of this. Hey, anytime...
1734446 1736406 I don't care what you're ranked.
1736490 1738784 You don't get no shot,<br />and I mean that!
1738867 1740220 I'm glad you<br />people are seeing this here.
1740244 1741930 What are you doing?<br />I want to fight this guy.
1741954 1743247 Well, you got him.
1743330 1745207 But you'll fight him without me.
1746166 1747668 What are you saying?<br />It's finished.
1747751 1749002 Yes, I'm finished.
1749086 1750379 I don't want no more of this.
1750462 1752464 I don't want no more,<br />you understand?
1752547 1755133 None of it! It's over with!
1757010 1760264 Hey, woman. Hey,<br />woman! Listen here.
1760347 1762182 Since your man<br />ain't got no heart,
1762266 1764142 maybe you'd like<br />to see a real man.
1764226 1765644 I bet you stay up<br />late every night
1765727 1767521 dreaming you had<br />a real man, don't you?
1767604 1769524 I'll tell you what. Bring<br />your pretty little self
1769606 1771275 over to my apartment tonight,
1771358 1772734 and I'll show you a real man.
1772818 1774778 You want it, you got it!
1780701 1781743 You got it!
1788375 1791753 Rocky, don't. Come on,<br />Rocky, please, let's go talk.
1791837 1794089 Adrian. Rocky, don't.
1794172 1796883 Rocky! Let's talk.
1801596 1802764 Why'd you leave?
1802848 1804349 Why'd you walk away like that?
1804433 1806351 Life's too short, kid.
1807227 1808645 Where you going?
1808729 1811398 I'm going on a<br />permanent vacation.
1812399 1814651 What are you talking about?<br />We got one more fight.
1814735 1816778 No, no. Not we, you.
1818613 1820574 Why are you doing this?
1825329 1826788 I said, why are you doing this?
1826872 1828999 Because you can't win, Rock!
1829082 1832336 This guy will kill you to<br />death inside of three rounds!
1832419 1833462 You're crazy.
1833545 1834713 What else is new?
1834796 1835964 He's just another fighter.
1836048 1838050 No, he ain't just<br />another fighter.
1838133 1841720 This guy is a wrecking<br />machine, and he's hungry!
1841803 1844348 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt!
1844431 1846725 What are you talking about?<br />I've had 10 title defenses.
1846808 1847976 That was easy!
1848060 1849144 What do you mean, easy?
1849227 1851021 They was hand-picked!
1854191 1856860 Setups? No, they weren't setups.
1856943 1860697 They was good fighters, but<br />they wasn't killers like this guy.
1860781 1863325 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
1883136 1884638 Jeez, Mick.
1886973 1888558 Why'd you do it?
1891144 1893563 Because the beating that you got
1893647 1895857 from Apollo should<br />have killed you, kid.
1896149 1897192 It didn't.
1897275 1901488 It was my job to keep you<br />winning and to keep you healthy.
1907327 1910497 You really don't think I<br />got nothing left, do you?
1911289 1915377 Well, Rock, let's<br />put it this way.
1917170 1919798 Three years ago<br />you was supernatural.
1920674 1924177 You was... You was<br />hard and you was nasty
1924261 1927305 and you had this cast-iron jaw.
1928348 1932769 But then the worst<br />thing happened to you
1932853 1935772 that could happen<br />to any fighter.
1935856 1939067 You got civilized. Yeah.
1943613 1945407 Don't worry, kid.
1945782 1950454 You know, presidents<br />retire, generals retire,
1950537 1954374 horses retire,<br />Man o' War retired.
1954791 1956835 They put him out to stud.
1958003 1960714 That's what you<br />should've done, retire.
1964342 1966928 I can't retire<br />knowing all this, Mick.
1967512 1970265 Don't push it. Well,<br />you been carrying me.
1970724 1972058 We don't need it.
1972142 1973685 You been carrying me, though.
1974519 1976313 I haven't been carrying you.
1976396 1977522 I've been protecting you.
1977606 1980942 No. Look, I want this<br />fight. Just one more.
1981026 1982235 No, we don't need it.
1982319 1984237 I'll live in the gym.
1984321 1985447 We don't need it.
1985530 1986948 Mick, I do.
1988158 1990285 I'm asking you to<br />train me one last time.
1990368 1992454 Oh, no, I can't.
1992537 1993830 If you don't,
1995123 1998335 I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't<br />bought a new pair of underwear in 10 years.
2000420 2002172 You would, wouldn't you?
2002255 2003924 Yeah, absolutely.
2006593 2008261 No, no.
2008345 2009596 Come on.
2011431 2013808 One more time, it's over.
2015602 2016787 It's a deal? Come on, come on.
2016811 2019314 It's your head, kid.<br />It's your head.
2022817 2025529 Yeah, it is. Thanks, Mick.
2027614 2030575 Pushin', gettin'<br />ready for the fight
2031201 2034454 Pushin', every day and night
2035997 2039251 Pushin', gettin' ready<br />for the fight
2039834 2042837 Pushin', every day and night
2043672 2046007 Pushin', gettin' ready<br />for the fight...
2046091 2050136 Rocky robes here. Get<br />your Rocky robes here. Hot off the truck.
2050220 2051888 Rocky robes, hot off the truck.
2051972 2053765 Clean stuff. Get your robes.
2061147 2063733 On the night of the fight
2063817 2065193 I will survive
2065277 2069072 There's nowhere to run,<br />there's nowhere to hide
2069155 2070907 On the night of the fight
2070991 2072993 It's just you and I
2073076 2077330 There's nowhere to run,<br />there's nowhere to hide...
2077414 2079207 Right here. Once in a lifetime!
2079291 2080792 Get your buttons here!
2081001 2083420 You can't stand<br />toe-to-toe with this guy
2083503 2086047 or he'll deposit<br />you up there on Mars.
2086298 2089050 He's too tough. He's too strong.
2090385 2094806 Listen, how the hell can we<br />train in this creep joint here?
2094931 2096349 I mean, this is kind of a house
2096433 2098268 of ill reputes or<br />something, isn't it?
2098351 2100270 Why did you rent this joint?
2100353 2102856 Oh, come on, Mickey.<br />Let's go out in style, okay?
2102939 2105400 You wanna go out in style,<br />go out in one piece!
2105483 2107068 Now, come on,<br />let's get out of here!
2107152 2108862 Let's go back to<br />the old gym, will you?
2108945 2111406 Let's get some blood and<br />sweat and tears around you!
2111489 2112907 Can we do that?
2112991 2115952 Hey, will you just<br />relax and enjoy it, okay?
2120165 2121833 They love it, Mick.
2129049 2131551 Go on, fight!<br />Fight now, go ahead!
2131635 2134220 Fight it, fight it.<br />Get rough, get tough.
2134304 2136056 Get brutal. That's it.
2136139 2138099 Excuse me. Could I get a kiss?
2138183 2139267 Yeah, sure.
2139726 2141311 Get out of here, will you?
2141394 2143063 This is like fighting in a zoo.
2143146 2144773 This is a zoo, you know?
2144856 2146650 Is that the way you<br />train for Clubber?
2146733 2148151 He ain't gonna Kiss you.
2148234 2150195 He's gonna kill you,<br />you know that?
2150278 2151404 Go on. Get out of here!
2157243 2159371 Rock, how about a<br />picture? Yeah, sure.
2159454 2160747 There you go. Rock.
2172133 2173718 Rocky! Rocky!
2201287 2202622 Put a little speed on there.
2202706 2204040 Put a little speed on there.
2204124 2206292 Thattaboy. That's it.
2215593 2218012 All right, this will<br />tell us the story.
2218096 2222517 That's it! Side to side!<br />Side to side, Rock!
2223309 2225145 Shut up back there, can't you?
2225228 2226730 Change your tune or...
2226813 2229649 That's it. Pull front<br />punches. That's it, kid.
2229733 2231109 You're a deadly weapon.
2231192 2234070 Time! Time, time, time. Quit it.
2234529 2236322 You're okay. Come on.
2237031 2239409 Here. Put this on before<br />you catch pneumonia.
2239492 2241244 Okay. I'll give<br />you a little rubdown, too.
2241327 2243413 Yeah. And listen, kid.
2243496 2247751 I don't like to hear much of what<br />comes out of people's mouths
2247834 2250462 and I don't like<br />soft-talking moments.
2250545 2251629 That's for sure.
2251713 2253923 You know, but I just<br />wanna tell you one thing,
2254007 2255592 that I'm proud of you.
2257093 2258219 Well, thanks a lot.
2258303 2259471 That's all right, kid.
2259554 2261347 Let's get out of here,<br />shall we? Hey, Mick.
2261431 2262640 Yeah?
2262724 2264493 What do you think we're<br />gonna do when it's all over, huh?
2264517 2268104 I don't know. Maybe join up with<br />a circus or something. All right.
2268188 2270398 Yeah, maybe. All<br />right, let's get out.
2277238 2279908 Good evening, everyone.<br />Along with Bill Baldwin, I'm Stu Nahan.
2279991 2282410 And we welcome you to<br />tonight's heavyweight title fight
2282577 2285079 which may<br />prove to be the most memorable of all.
2285163 2286790 For tonight is<br />the champion's final
2286873 2289292 and perhaps most<br />difficult title defense.
2289375 2291604 Rocky, do you feel you're in<br />the best shape of your career?
2291628 2293463 Oh, yeah, absolutely.<br />I feel real good.
2293546 2296382 He's a deadly weapon, he's one<br />of a kind. And he's gonna do it.
2296466 2298194 Clubber, do you<br />think you're as fast as Balboa?
2298218 2299945 I don't wanna do no talking.<br />I'll do my talking in the ring.
2299969 2301805 Clubber, dance for us.
2303640 2305159 I told you, you<br />better get out of here!
2305183 2306559 I want to be alone!
2306643 2308311 Will you<br />retire after this fight?
2308394 2309954 Oh, yeah, this is<br />the last one for sure.
2310021 2311564 After this, me and<br />Mick are finished.
2311689 2313233 This is definitely the last one.
2313316 2315193 You're all parasites<br />and leeches.
2315276 2316444 Get out of here!
2316528 2318822 What will you do after tonight?
2319614 2321574 I'm not sure.
2321658 2323535 Maybe join the circus,<br />huh, Mick?
2323618 2325620 Yeah, have some fun.
2325703 2326996 Come on, take your robe off.
2327080 2329707 Come on, take off your robe!
2329791 2332335 I told you to<br />get out of my face!
2332418 2333837 With us this<br />evening is the former
2333920 2335255 heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
2335338 2336589 Apollo Creed.
2336673 2338275 Do you have any<br />predictions on this fight?
2338299 2340260 How do you see this<br />fight going tonight?
2340343 2343179 Well, I feel that strength would<br />have to go to the challenger,
2343263 2345265 while experience and<br />the world's hardest head
2345348 2346683 would have to go<br />to Rocky Balboa.
2346766 2348006 And you know I know about that.
2348351 2351020 Now remember, Rock,<br />don't trade with this guy.
2351104 2353064 Take your time. Wear him down.
2353189 2355191 But don't stand toe-to-toe<br />with him. Mmm-hmm.
2355275 2358278 This punk's never been<br />15 rounds before.
2358945 2360530 Take him good. Okay.
2360613 2361948 Take him good. I will.
2362031 2363408 That's it.
2364033 2365553 So I predict that the<br />champ's gonna take this one.
2365577 2368257 Now, wait a minute. Do you really<br />think the champ can hit that hard?
2369455 2371295 Why do you think I'm<br />sitting out here with you?
2389267 2390435 Hey, sucker!
2390518 2392437 Balboa, you gone, you finished!
2392520 2395189 You through! You washed<br />up! I'm the baddest in the world!
2395273 2396649 You don't look so bad to me.
2396733 2398067 What you say, paper champion?
2398151 2399295 I'm gonna beat you like a dog.
2399319 2400403 A dog, you hear me!
2400486 2402405 Can't you get that<br />ape back into the ring?
2402488 2404657 You made me wait too<br />long! You gonna pay!
2404741 2406743 Come on, mouth!<br />Get out of my way.
2406826 2408536 Get him out of there, can't you?
2408620 2410330 Get him out of there!
2414459 2415899 Get out of my way!<br />Get out of my way!
2415960 2418087 Back up.
2418171 2420089 You know who<br />I am? You know who I am?
2420173 2422091 I'm the man! I'm the man!
2425803 2429182 You're dead meat! You're<br />dead meat! Let me go!
2429265 2431601 Rocky! Rocky!
2431684 2433227 Get off!
2433311 2434938 What's the matter? Mick!
2435021 2437398 What's wrong, Adrian?<br />Get a doctor!
2437482 2439859 Somebody get a doctor! Come on!
2441653 2444238 Sit here, Mick.<br />Get them out of here.

2449327 2450679 Come on, Mick, will<br />you sit on the table?
2450703 2452038 Mick? Mick! I'm all right.
2452121 2454290 Just take a deep breath.<br />Get those guys out of here!
2454374 2456584 Move! Mick, will<br />you sit on the...
2456668 2458962 Paulie. Paulie, tell them<br />the fight's off. Go on. Go on!
2459045 2460296 No! The fight's not off.
2460380 2461899 What, are you out of<br />your mind or something?
2461923 2463424 The fight's on. Are you crazy?
2463508 2465027 Mick, we can't.<br />Not tonight. I ain't fighting...
2465051 2466844 Yes, tonight. We're gonna fight.
2466928 2468930 Just let me get my breath.<br />Can't I get my breath?
2469013 2470157 Is that against the<br />rules or something?
2470181 2472100 Mick... Will you<br />please get a doctor?
2472183 2474060 Paulie, go on. He's on his way.
2474143 2475579 Mick, I can't go out<br />there and fight like this.
2475603 2476854 I can't go out there like this.
2476938 2479649 Now, get out there.<br />Get going, will you?
2479732 2481109 Take him. Take him good.
2481192 2482485 Get it over with, why don't you?
2482568 2485571 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
2485655 2488241 Adrian, what am<br />I supposed to do?
2488324 2490386 What the hell do you mean,<br />what are you supposed to do?
2490410 2493454 After all these years together,<br />you don't know what to do?
2493538 2494998 You ought to be<br />ashamed of yourself.
2495081 2497083 Now get out there and do it!
2498668 2499836 Do it.
2501546 2502714 Do it!

2580500 2582627 All right. Good luck to you.
2587340 2588758 All right, fans, here we go.
2588841 2591761 Presenting to you, on my<br />left, out of the blue corner,
2591844 2597100 hailing from Chicago, weighing<br />in at an even 235 pounds,
2597183 2600103 <i>the world's number<br />one challenger...</i>
2600186 2601437 I wonder how Mick's doing.
2601521 2603481 The undefeated Clubber Lang.
2604899 2608361 I'm the best. I'm the<br />best. I'm the best.
2608861 2611781 You and Clubber exchanged<br />words up there. Any comment?
2611864 2612907 I have no comment.
2614117 2615594 And his<br />opponent in the opposite corner
2615618 2619288 really needing no<br />introduction the world over.
2619372 2622875 He weighs in at<br />a trim 201 pounds,
2622959 2627755 the pride of Philadelphia,<br />the Italian Stallion,
2627839 2631968 and the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
2632051 2635638 Rocky Balboa!
2638808 2640685 Listen to this crowd.
2646649 2648544 Now to give<br />instructions in the middle of the ring,
2648568 2651195 the referee, Marty Denkin.
2654115 2655475 Clubber, Rocky,<br />you know the rules.
2655908 2657076 I want a good, clean fight.
2657160 2658804 When I tell you to break,<br />I want you to step back
2658828 2660121 at my command and break.
2660204 2664000 Now, go back to the corner<br />and come out fighting at the bell.
2664750 2666085 Dead meat.
2671424 2674135 This is not<br />gonna be a fight of finesse.
2674218 2676429 These are two guys<br />that really throw punches.
2676554 2678323 This thing could end with one<br />punch. The chump is scared.
2678347 2680641 Scared. Scared. Yeah.<br />Tear him up, champ.
2680725 2682768 See the look in his eyes?
2684312 2688232 I'm no trainer. Just go out<br />and kill the guy. Kill him, Rock.
2689442 2690985 He's scared.
2691903 2693922 I'm the new champion. I'm<br />the new champion as of today.
2693946 2695215 I'm the new<br />champion as of today.
2695239 2697200 The Italian Stallion.<br />A rugged champion
2697283 2700745 in the final fight of his<br />colorful career tonight.
2700828 2702163 And Jimmy Lennon was correct.
2702288 2704624 He looks<br />like... Well, just great.
2705333 2709128 Here we go! Oh, boy,<br />the champion came out swinging.
2709212 2710463 Break his head!
2710546 2712590 Balboa's off to<br />an incredible start!
2712673 2716093 He looks determined to<br />destroy the bigger challenger.
2718721 2720181 Clubber, get in<br />there, get in there!
2720264 2721974 Move him back. Move him back.
2726562 2727980 Defense!
2728481 2729941 Now it is Balboa.
2730024 2731651 They're going at each other now.
2734195 2736489 You got him! You got him, Rock!
2736864 2738699 Double up! Double up!
2741244 2744705 Come on. Come on,<br />Balboa! Come on!
2746791 2750336 The challenger is hitting<br />him with everything he's got.
2750586 2751629 No!
2752546 2754131 Come on, Balboa!
2754799 2757093 Come on, Balboa! Make me weak.
2757760 2760596 Come on, Balboa! Come on.
2766644 2769939 Clubber away. Trying<br />to get him back to his corner.
2770022 2771691 Grab him, Paulie.
2773025 2774610 Where's Mick? Where's Mick?
2774694 2775778 He's okay.
2775861 2777405 I need him now. I need him here.
2777488 2780449 He ain't nothing. I told you he<br />ain't nothing. He ain't nothing.
2780533 2781826 He's too strong.
2781909 2783953 Don't talk like that,<br />Rocko. Come on.
2784036 2785180 Tear him up!<br />I'm gonna smoke him.
2785204 2787290 I'm gonna smoke him.<br />I'm gonna smoke him.
2787373 2789875 I can't keep him off.<br />I can't keep him off.
2790209 2791627 He's mine. He's mine!
2791711 2793151 I'm gonna get him!<br />I'm gonna get him!
2793212 2795214 I'm losing it, Paulie.<br />Where's Mick?
2797383 2799468 What do you<br />got there? - 200 over 50.
2799552 2801595 All right, let's start CPR.
2802513 2803889 Rock, you can do it.
2803973 2805057 I'll try.
2806684 2808853 Rocky appears to be staggering.
2809020 2810479 Yeah, I'll get him.
2810563 2812773 Coming out of the corner,<br />here comes Clubber.
2814150 2816527 Come on, Rocky,<br />show him. Let's go. Come on.
2816610 2820281 <i>Come on, Balboa! Come on! Come<br />on, oversized hick! Give it 10 me.</i>
2820364 2823242 Let's see what you<br />can do. Bring it to me!
2824243 2825911 Move on the inside!
2827079 2829540 The champion is nearly helpless.
2829623 2831709 My gosh, what a<br />beating he's taking.
2836589 2838507 Don't stand toe-to-toe with him!
2838591 2840217 Come on, Balboa!
2858694 2859904 Get up!
2859987 2863199 Get up, sucker!
2863282 2865493 Five. Six.<br />Come on, get up! Get up!
2865576 2871040 Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.<br />You're out!
2871290 2872416 The champion is finished!
2872541 2874261 I did it! I'm the<br />best! In the second round!
2874335 2875544 I'm the man! I beat Balboa!
2875628 2877213 Unbelievable. Incredible upset.
2877296 2880883 Balboa in the corner, out<br />on his feet. Out of the plank.
2886389 2888432 We have the time.
2888516 2890393 The winner by knockout,
2890476 2895940 the new heavyweight champion<br />of the world, Clubber Lang!
2896023 2900236 Yeah, I told you.<br />I told you I'd do it.
2900319 2903364 Yeah! I'm the new<br />champ of the world!
2912081 2913249 Come on, get out of here!
2913332 2914834 Get out of here, now.
2919505 2920714 Oh, Rocky, what happened?
2920798 2921924 I'm all right, how's Mick?
2922007 2923693 He wouldn't go to the<br />hospital till you got here.
2923717 2925636 What? DOCTOR:<br />Mr. Balboa, time is important.
2925719 2927888 We must get him to<br />the hospital immediately.
2927972 2929056 Okay.
2943070 2944113 Mick?
2944864 2946240 Yeah?
2946323 2947533 Mick.
2949410 2953539 What? What? What? Is it over?
2954039 2957334 Yeah, it's all over.
2957668 2961046 Hey, listen, what happened?
2962131 2963841 It was a knockout.
2965718 2968095 What round? What round?
2968179 2970014 Second round.
2972224 2973767 Yeah, I knew it.
2973851 2976395 That's good. We did it, huh?
2976479 2979273 We did it. We did it. All right.
2979356 2981317 You don't have to worry<br />about nothing no more.
2981400 2982651 No. Good.
2982735 2984153 Everything's gonna<br />be okay, Mick.
2984236 2986280 You know? Yeah. I<br />knew that we did it.
2986363 2988741 You gotta get to the hospital.
2988866 2991202 You're not as young<br />as you used to be.
2991285 2993871 You're the winner.
2993954 2996707 We did everything right.<br />I did everything...
2996790 2999668 No, no, listen. We ain't<br />done everything right.
2999752 3001670 Listen, we got more to do.
3001754 3004840 Mick, whatever you<br />wanna do, we'll do it, okay?
3004924 3007676 I love you, kid. I love you.
3008928 3010763 Mick?
3010846 3012640 It hurts me.
3015226 3016352 Mick?
3020773 3021982 Mick?
3030616 3031951 Mick.
3044004 3046215 Oh, God!
3052638 3056433 Don't go away, please, don't.
3056517 3059395 All the things we didn't do.
3059478 3062398 We got more to do. We got...
3063649 3068320 Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus.
3127296 3129715 This concludes our service.
3304139 3306433 That's not the way to do it.
3306517 3307893 Who's that?
3309228 3312189 Why don't you hit it<br />straight? Step into it.
3314566 3316360 Apollo?
3316443 3319404 Right. I waited at your<br />house for about an hour
3319488 3322115 and your wife said<br />you might be here.
3322491 3324076 What are you doing here?
3324201 3325744 Business.
3327329 3329206 If the papers knew we<br />were talking like this,
3329289 3331416 they'd think we was crazy.
3332000 3333335 Why you?
3333418 3336630 Because I'm the best, and you<br />need somebody to teach you different.
3336755 3338882 Why? Well,<br />to be honest with you,
3338966 3341218 I don't think you could<br />pull it off without me, Rock.
3341301 3345889 You still didn't give me the answer,<br />Apollo. What's the real reason?
3345973 3348267 Listen. It's quiet, isn't it?
3349726 3351979 When you retire, it's too quiet.
3352104 3354398 I mean, we're too<br />young to retire anyway.
3354481 3356733 Besides, with the right touch,
3356817 3359087 I could promote this thing<br />into the biggest gig of all time.
3359111 3360904 It'd be bigger than ours.
3360988 3365200 Heaven knows, I don't mind<br />being involved with large numbers, right?
3366743 3369288 I don't need this no more. I...
3369371 3371498 I don't want this no more.
3372249 3377504 Look, man. When you<br />beat me, I hurt all over
3377588 3381800 and I didn't want to know from<br />nothing or nobody, not even my kids.
3381884 3383969 Hell, every fighter<br />knows that hurt.
3384052 3387222 And we get sick inside trying to<br />live with it, so don't back off now.
3387306 3391226 Make it right for yourself<br />or you'll be sorry you didn't.
3391310 3394730 We held the greatest title<br />in the whole world, babe.
3396648 3399067 You lost that fight, Rock,<br />for all the wrong reasons.
3399151 3401528 You lost your edge.
3401612 3406491 All right, I know your manager<br />dying had you all messed up inside.
3407492 3410203 But the truth is, you<br />didn't look hungry.
3410913 3412789 Now, when we fought,
3413790 3416835 you had that eye of<br />the tiger, man, the edge.
3416919 3418253 And now you gotta get it back.
3418337 3420631 And the way to get it back is<br />to go back to the beginning.
3420714 3423884 You know what I mean?
3423967 3426511 Maybe we could win<br />it back together.
3428263 3430140 Eye of the tiger, man.
3433977 3436104 Why'd you have to come here?
3437105 3439524 I have the plan. Get back, man.
3442611 3444363 You got me curious.
3446365 3448367 You got me curious, Rock.
3453121 3457167 Clubber, do you accept the<br />challenge for a rematch with Balboa?
3457250 3460629 I reject the challenge,<br />because Balboa is no challenge.
3460712 3463173 But I'd be more than happy<br />to beat up on him some more.
3463256 3465008 I always said he was nothing.
3465092 3466802 I can't wait to<br />see this bum fall.
3466885 3469972 What do you think of him<br />being trained by Apollo Creed?
3470055 3471348 Apollo who?
3471431 3473558 You talking about that<br />old fool, Apollo Creed?
3473684 3475912 Shucks, one has-been teaching<br />another. Yeah, just keep talking, pal.
3475936 3477038 That's all Apollo been<br />doing... Keep talking.
3477062 3478647 Running off at the mouth lately.
3478730 3480941 And when I see him,<br />I'm gonna close it for him.
3481024 3483694 All right. When will<br />the match take place?
3483777 3484945 The sooner, the better.
3485028 3486238 I'm the champion of the world.
3486321 3487698 And nothing can<br />be done about that.
3487781 3490075 I can't be beat,<br />and I won't be beat.
3490158 3491785 This time I'm gonna<br />train even harder.
3491868 3493412 There won't be no<br />quick knockdowns.
3493495 3494788 I'm gonna torture him.
3494871 3497082 I'm gonna crucify him real bad.
3497249 3499459 Hard words from a hard man.
3499543 3503422 The odds against Balboa<br />making a comeback at 34
3503505 3505257 are very long indeed.
3505340 3508510 Can he do it?<br />Most experts doubt it.
3508593 3513849 Balboa was a fine champion, but<br />his time has passed. I wish him luck.
3515100 3516977 Don't listen to it, Rocky.
3517060 3519646 No, do listen to it, Rock.
3519730 3524109 When this is over, a lot of folks are<br />gonna owe you an engraved apology.
3526278 3527630 And you're gonna<br />owe me a big favor.
3527654 3529197 What favor?
3529948 3531825 When it's over.
3537122 3540417 Rocko, come on.<br />We're gonna be late at the airport.
3541585 3543754 Let's go. ADRIAN:<br />Think we forgot anything?
3544129 3546631 I think we have it<br />all. Maybe another sweater.
3546715 3548508 No, California's not that cold.
3548592 3550343 It's great, great. A scorcher.
3550427 3552846 Okay, listen, I want you<br />to be a good boy, okay?
3552971 3555390 Okay. And don't give<br />anybody a hard time.
3555474 3559728 Okay. Give me a kiss. Yeah.
3565984 3568862 We'll call when we<br />land. Yeah, we'll call.
3572866 3575243 You'll be a good boy? All right.
3575327 3577704 I'll bring you back something.
3592385 3594763 I been told by
3596098 3598517 Some people and they all
3599726 3602020 Say to take you back
3604189 3606733 Take you back like before
3608276 3611196 I don't call that a reason
3612572 3618036 I just call it<br />believin' in myself
3618787 3621331 Believin' in myself
3623291 3625085 What the hell are<br />we doing here in LA?
3625168 3626354 Hey, man, this is<br />where I started.
3626378 3627462 Yeah, so?
3627546 3629214 So this is where he's starting.
3629297 3630465 But this place is disgusting.
3630549 3631692 Why don't we stay at your place?
3631716 3633301 Look, I think you're<br />missing the point.
3633385 3635822 Let's just go on and check in<br />and get over to the gym, all right?
3635846 3638306 Rock, in my opinion,<br />we don't need this place.
3638390 3640142 It's below you and<br />the sister's standard.
3640225 3643520 We're gonna give it a try,<br />Paulie. Come on, Adrian.
3654781 3656533 I don't even have a gun.
3664249 3665292 You know, fun is fun.
3665375 3669129 I like those kind of things, but<br />this I don't like. Look at this place.
3669212 3672674 Rats even have more pride<br />than to be caught dead here.
3673675 3675760 I mean, look at the dump.
3675844 3677053 I just don't like it.
3677137 3679723 - Think of Adrian's health.<br />- I'm fine, Paulie.
3702704 3703914 Balboa.
3703997 3705290 What's he doing out here?
3711755 3713882 This is where I started.
3713965 3715467 That's your problem.
3715884 3717969 Rocko, let's leave before<br />they leave us for dead.
3721306 3724267 Yeah, you see that<br />look in their eyes, Rock?
3725769 3727354 When we fought, Rock,<br />I trained hard,
3727437 3728623 but I didn't have<br />that look in my eyes.
3728647 3730982 You had it. You won.
3732817 3735070 You gotta get<br />that look back, Rock.
3735153 3736738 Eye of the tiger, man.
3736821 3738531 Eye of the tiger, come on.
3738615 3740450 Come on, let's go.
3740533 3743495 Look at this place.<br />No class in here.
3743578 3744913 Is he always so cheerful?
3744996 3746331 I don't sweat you.
3746414 3748750 Hey. Hey, Paulie. Don't<br />get mentally irregular.
3748833 3750168 It's a free country.
3750252 3751962 Just don't get<br />irregular, all right?
3752045 3754297 I don't need no<br />philosophy lesson here.
3754381 3756461 Well, it just takes about<br />six years to get to know...
3756508 3758969 Well, I ain't got six years.
3759052 3761471 Hey, come on,<br />Paulie. Just relax.
3761596 3764015 Come on. We're on business.
3767227 3769145 Hey! Hey, champ!
3769229 3771314 Hey, Duke, my man.
3771398 3772917 Hey, everything's set<br />up and ready to go, baby.
3772941 3774669 Good. I know you know<br />who this man is, don't you?
3774693 3776333 Yeah. It's gonna be<br />good working with you.
3776403 3778280 Certainly had enough<br />of working against you.
3778363 3780031 Hey, how you feel?<br />Pretty good, thanks.
3780115 3781676 He's doing great. We've<br />been living modern,
3781700 3783118 but now we're gonna train old.
3783201 3785054 I'm going over here and talk<br />to some of the guys, all right.
3785078 3787163 Hey! The champ is home!
3789708 3792460 We gotta leave.<br />I got a reputation.
3792544 3793712 What do you mean, reputation?
3793795 3796256 You heard. I don't<br />like these people.
3796339 3798258 You don't like them?
3799676 3802470 Maybe they don't<br />like you either, Paulie.
3802554 3804431 What'd I do to them?
3805640 3807350 And they call me punchy.
3807434 3810645 Hey, Stallion, Stallion, come on<br />over here and meet some of the fellas.
3810729 3812188 I'll be right back.
3812272 3814065 How you doing, guys?
3825368 3827996 That's it, that's<br />it. Come on, on the toes.
3828079 3829497 On the toes, on the toes.
3829581 3831124 On the toes, come on.
3831207 3832709 On the toes, on the toes.
3833752 3835253 Come on, Rock.
3836004 3838089 He ain't too graceful.
3838173 3839841 That's why we're here, Paulie.
3840133 3842552 Waste of time.<br />He's got heavy feet.
3842635 3844179 Get on the balls of your feet.
3844262 3846222 Come on, relax, Rock.
3846306 3848284 Come on, get those feet<br />out of the concrete. Come on.
3848308 3850310 It'll take time, but it'll come.
3850393 3853813 He can't train to<br />the jungle junk music.
3853938 3856125 Come on, relax, Rock. APOLLO:<br />Here we go. Here we go, come on.
3856149 3857984 - On the balls of<br />your feet. - Balance.
3858068 3859170 Let your body find the rhythm.
3859194 3861821 Gonna start a new<br />dance called the crawl.
3861905 3864532 I'm telling you, you can't<br />train him like a colored fighter.
3864616 3865784 He ain't got no rhythm.
3865867 3866993 All right? Come on.
3867077 3868078 How stupid do I look?
3868161 3869662 You look great. You look great.
3869746 3872791 Everything we do works<br />off the jab. You can do it.
3873625 3874709 Yeah.
3875710 3876961 Can he swim?
3877087 3878296 With a name like Rock?
3878922 3880507 No time to waste! Let's go!
3880590 3882092 Another lap! Another lap!
3882175 3884094 Move it! Another lap!
3884177 3886554 He ain't no tuna. We<br />belong back in the gym.
3886638 3888198 Look, he's gotta<br />stretch and use muscles
3888264 3890225 he never thought he<br />had. Come on, Rock!
3890308 3891726 Come on, stretch now!
3891810 3893353 Come on, move it, Rock! Move it!
3893436 3894604 Nobody can change that much.
3894687 3897065 He's a bruiser.<br />He ain't no boxer.
3897148 3899067 You keep telling him<br />that and he'll be nothing.
3899150 3900527 You know? Yeah?
3900610 3902487 Another lap! Come<br />on now! Move it!
3903696 3906032 Move it! Come on!<br />Move it, Rock! Move it!
3906116 3908076 Come on, let's go. Let's go!
3908243 3910245 That's it,<br />stretch it! Stretch it out!
3910328 3913289 That's it, let's go. You<br />gotta pull. Hard now, hard!
3921464 3924676 Shut up, you Sterno bums!<br />I'll squash you!
3925176 3927053 There's decent<br />people trying to sleep!
3927137 3929764 Shut up, you honky<br />scum bastard mother!
3930473 3932642 Who needs this sick place?
3932976 3934185 I don't.
3935645 3936896 No class.
3940525 3942694 Damn, that Clubber's strong.
3943236 3945488 Fifteen rounds is a long time.
3946948 3949075 We gotta put him away early.
3950535 3951846 I figure with the<br />pace we gotta set,
3951870 3955331 Rock can last maybe<br />seven or eight rounds.
3957000 3959794 Then we'll be out of steam, man.
3959878 3962046 We got to put him away early.
3965550 3967552 At least the water's hot.
3970972 3973600 Well, we never really<br />had a honeymoon.
3975810 3977395 It's not so bad.
3979856 3981941 We've been in worse places.
3983443 3985653 In the corner,<br />Rocky's in trouble in round two!
3985737 3987071 He takes a right! Another right!
3987155 3989073 He's been cut! Rocky's been cut!
3991242 3994329 Come on, Rock.<br />Come on, come on, now.
3994412 3996831 Come on. You gotta get<br />tougher. You gotta get tougher.
3996915 3998333 Think smooth. Think smooth.
3998416 3999584 Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.
3999667 4001878 Toes, toes, on your toes, Rock.
4001961 4004130 On your toes! On<br />your toes! On your toes!
4005381 4007842 Push yourself, Rock!<br />Concentrate.
4007926 4009594 Let's move it, Rock!<br />Move it, now!
4009677 4011554 Come on, Rock, come on!
4011638 4014390 Have fun with this.<br />Have fun with it.
4014974 4017018 That's it. Easy, easy, easy.
4017143 4019187 Smooth. On the toes.
4019270 4021606 Don't push it, don't<br />push it. Let it come.
4021689 4024359 It'll come. This<br />takes time, baby.
4024442 4026282 This takes time. DUKE:<br />Come on, move your head.
4026319 4029197 Move your head. Move<br />your head up and down.
4029280 4032408 Come on, come on. Swift<br />now, up and down. In and out.
4032492 4035954 Inside. Inside. Inside, baby.
4036037 4037247 Side to side. Move your head.
4037330 4038540 Watch it now. Watch it now.
4038623 4040875 Remember, he's got<br />two hands, right?
4045296 4047382 Damn, man, what<br />the hell are you doing?
4047465 4049717 This guy will knock<br />you on your ass!
4052011 4054055 Come on, Rock, it's not a game.
4054138 4058059 You want to lay up in a<br />hospital for five weeks this time?
4058142 4060562 You thought I was tough?<br />This chump will kill you.
4060645 4061771 All right.
4061854 4064274 Come on, come on. Get your<br />head on your shoulders, man.
4064357 4066401 Think about the fight!<br />Think about the fight!
4066484 4069296 Clubber Lang's in, he's trying to<br />hurt you, Rock. He's trying to hurt you.
4069320 4071781 Okay, here it comes.<br />Jab! He's jabbing!
4071864 4073491 He's jabbing! He's<br />trying to hurt you.
4073575 4075910 You gotta fight. You gotta move.
4077870 4079664 He's up against the ropes!
4079747 4081499 He can't get out of the corner.
4085837 4088298 He's hooked you! He's<br />hooked you! He's hooked you!
4088381 4090174 Damn, Rock, come on!
4091134 4092635 What's the matter with you?
4092719 4094929 Tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow.
4095013 4096806 There is no tomorrow!
4098057 4099851 There is no tomorrow!
4100727 4102687 There is no tomorrow!
4108109 4109878 Look, there's just one<br />thing that you gotta remember.
4109902 4111696 We gotta get some speed.
4111779 4114699 You gotta get some flexibility.<br />You gotta get some quickness.
4114782 4115992 You understand?
4116075 4117553 Quickness, endurance,<br />that's the end of it.
4117577 4120204 That's the only thing we gotta<br />concern ourselves with, Rock.
4120330 4123041 All right. Mickey<br />never had me do this.
4124167 4126586 Yeah. Okay, here we go.
4128171 4129464 Ready?
4133635 4134636 Set. Yeah.
4134719 4136179 Go!
4136262 4138848 Come on, come on! Dig, dig, dig!
4138931 4140933 Come on! Come on!
4148691 4150193 Come on!
4151527 4153404 You can't win, Rock.
4154947 4157992 You ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
4159202 4161746 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
4205289 4206958 What's the matter?
4208459 4209794 It's over.
4210336 4211838 It's all over.
4222682 4224809 What's the matter with you?
4260344 4262013 Can I talk to you?
4266684 4267953 I wanna ask you<br />something important
4267977 4270021 and I want you<br />to tell me the truth.
4270897 4272190 What?
4273191 4275067 Why did you come here?
4276360 4278905 I just don't want it no more.
4278988 4282408 If it's over because you<br />want it to be over, I'm glad.
4283117 4284202 I do.
4285620 4289332 It's just, you've never quit<br />anything since I've known you.
4293586 4295713 I don't know what<br />you want me to say.
4295797 4297882 I mean, how? What happened?
4297965 4301052 How did everything that<br />was so good get so bad?
4302053 4304180 What's so bad? Tell me, what?
4304263 4307433 I wrecked everything<br />by not thinking for myself.
4307517 4309745 I mean, why couldn't Mickey<br />tell me where I was really at,
4309769 4311020 right from the start?
4311103 4312730 He didn't have to<br />carry me and lie to me
4312814 4315775 and make me think I was better<br />than I really was when I wasn't.
4315858 4317235 He never lied.
4317318 4319487 Those fights weren't right.<br />They weren't, Adrian.
4319570 4321447 I never fought anybody<br />who was in their prime.
4321531 4323950 There was always some<br />angle to hold on to the title
4324033 4325785 longer than I<br />should have had it.
4325868 4327708 I mean, do you understand<br />what I'm saying here?
4327787 4330498 I understand. But you've gotta<br />understand that he loved you,
4330581 4332375 and that was his job,<br />protecting you.
4332458 4334460 Well, that protecting<br />don't help nothing.
4334544 4335837 It only makes things worse.
4335920 4339382 You wake up after a few years<br />thinking you're a winner, but you're not.
4339465 4340925 You're really a loser.
4341008 4343845 And so we wouldn't have<br />had the title as long. So what?
4343928 4345721 At least it would've<br />been real, Adrian.
4345805 4347056 It was real.
4347139 4349851 Nothing is real if you don't<br />believe in who you are.
4349934 4352436 I don't believe in myself no<br />more. Don't you understand?
4352520 4353956 When a fighter don't<br />believe, that's it.
4353980 4355857 He's finished.<br />It's over. That's it.
4355940 4357608 That's not it! That is it!
4357692 4359110 Why don't you tell me the truth!
4359193 4361320 What are you putting<br />me through, Adrian?
4361404 4362530 You wanna know the truth?
4362613 4364532 The truth is, I don't<br />want to lose what I got.
4364615 4366468 In the beginning, I didn't care<br />about what happened to me.
4366492 4368953 I'd go in a ring, I'd get<br />busted up, I didn't care.
4369036 4370913 But now there's you,<br />there's the kid.
4370997 4372331 I don't wanna lose what I got!
4372415 4375001 What do we have that<br />can't be replaced? What?
4375084 4378129 A house? We got<br />cars. We got money.
4378212 4380214 We got everything but the truth!
4380298 4381883 What's the truth, damn it?
4381966 4384385 I'm afraid, all right?
4384468 4385636 You wanna hear me say it?
4385720 4387847 You wanna break me<br />down? All right, I'm afraid!
4387930 4389932 For the first time in<br />my life, I'm afraid.
4390016 4391475 I'm afraid, too!
4391559 4392995 There's nothing wrong<br />with being afraid.
4393019 4394437 There is. For me there is!
4394520 4395897 Why? You're human, aren't you?
4395980 4398524 Look, I don't know what I<br />am. All I know is I'm a liar,
4398608 4400610 and because of that<br />Mickey ain't here no more.
4400693 4402653 You didn't push<br />him into anything!
4402737 4405406 He was a grown man and<br />he did what he had to do.
4405489 4408910 And you have no right to feel<br />guilty for what happened, you don't!
4408993 4411662 You were a champion. And you<br />did what you were expected to do.
4411746 4414624 You did what I and everybody<br />else thought you should do.
4414707 4417707 And you wanna tell me that those<br />fights weren't real? That you were carried?
4417752 4419086 Well, I don't believe it!
4419170 4420522 But it doesn't<br />matter what I believe.
4420546 4423674 Because you're the one that's<br />gotta carry that fear around inside you.
4423758 4426761 Afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
4426844 4428971 Afraid you're gonna be<br />remembered as a coward,
4429055 4431223 that you're not a man any more.
4431307 4434560 Well, none of it's true, but<br />it doesn't matter if I tell you.
4434644 4437772 It doesn't matter, because<br />you're the one that's gotta settle it.
4437855 4438940 Get rid of it!
4439023 4440983 Because when all<br />the smoke has cleared
4441067 4443069 and everyone's through<br />chanting your name,
4443152 4444946 it's just gonna be us!
4445029 4446238 And you can't live like this.
4446322 4448240 We can't live like this.
4448324 4450618 Because it's gonna bother<br />you for the rest of your life.
4450701 4453037 Look what it's doing to you now.
4459085 4462004 Apollo thinks you<br />can do it. So do I.
4463172 4465633 But you. You've gotta wanna<br />do it for the right reasons.
4465716 4467510 Not for the guilt over Mickey,
4467593 4470179 not for the people,<br />not for the title,
4470262 4472682 not for money or me,<br />but for you.
4473808 4475810 Just you, just you alone.
4480064 4481857 And if I lose?
4481941 4485403 Then you lose, but at least<br />you lose with no excuses.
4486696 4488489 No fear.
4488572 4491075 And I know you<br />could live with that.
4498833 4500710 How'd you get so tough?
4502878 4504755 I live with a fighter.
4511262 4512930 I really love you.
4520438 4521814 I love you.
4544920 4546881 No, no, no, Rock. No.
4546964 4548684 Just flick it, just<br />flick it. Just flick it.
4555306 4557767 Come on, one more time. Come on!
4568986 4570821 Good. Five more laps.
4573574 4575010 Watch it, watch it,<br />watch it, watch it.
4575034 4576952 There you go, come on.
4605356 4606982 Jab.
4609860 4611904 You got to move it faster.
4617034 4619370 Faster! Faster! Go on. Kick it.
4622414 4623749 Very nice!
4639515 4640742 Move your head. Move your head.
4640766 4642518 Move it. Move your head.
4643144 4645479 That's right, under!<br />Under and over.
4645563 4647731 Up and down. Turn around.
4648190 4649483 That was nice.
4656740 4659493 Come on, pick them up now.<br />On your toes. On your toes.
4659577 4661203 Come on. Come on. Come on.
4661287 4662830 Come on, now.<br />Speed, speed, speed.
4662913 4665499 Faster, faster, faster.<br />Yeah! Good.
4667168 4669253 Ready. Ready.
4676051 4677595 Rocky the fish!
4708375 4709501 Yeah!
4725559 4727102 All right!
4734068 4737071 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br />I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin
4737154 4739406 and we welcome you to<br />Madison Square Garden,
4739490 4742576 a most exciting backdrop for<br />the anxiously awaited rematch
4742743 4745287 between<br />the former champion, Rocky Balboa
4745371 4747915 and the reigning heavyweight<br />champion, Clubber Lang.
4747998 4751961 We now switch to our remote<br />cameras inside the dressing rooms.
4752044 4755089 Would you care to comment<br />on how you plan to fight Balboa?
4755172 4756257 What's your strategy?
4756340 4757424 Don't need any.
4757508 4760844 Balboa's so predictable and<br />stupid, the man comes straight ahead.
4760928 4763722 He's tailor-made for me<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
4763806 4764974 Just make sure you...
4765015 4767810 That's good... turn<br />them over. Good?
4768394 4770396 How does that look? Okay? Huh?
4771063 4773774 No, I don't hate Balboa,<br />but I pity the fool,
4773857 4777403 and I will destroy any man<br />who tries to take what I got.
4781198 4783409 Remember where you came from.
4784201 4786829 Remember what it<br />took to get you here.
4787621 4790082 And you remember what<br />he did to you last time, right?
4790249 4792209 Since both men are brawlers, Stu,
4792293 4794169 with the edge in power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
4794253 4796297 I would say that<br />the odds are very long
4796380 4798507 against Balboa<br />regaining his title.
4799216 4800926 Now it's your turn.
4801218 4803012 It's your turn, huh?
4804138 4806348 What's your<br />prediction for the fight, then?
4806432 4808392 Prediction? Yes, prediction.
4810894 4811979 Pain.
4812855 4815649 Lang is a brawler who likes<br />to hurt a man to the body.
4815733 4819320 And, you know, Balboa may never<br />have psychologically recovered
4819403 4821947 from that vicious knockout<br />that Clubber laid on him.
4823741 4825075 It's time.
4827202 4828537 Here. What?
4831790 4833834 I want you to wear these.
4836253 4838672 Come on, Apollo, these are
4838756 4841091 the colors that you wore<br />in our first fight together.
4842634 4843761 I can't wear your colors.
4843844 4845137 Just wear it.
4846430 4848390 Yeah? Yeah.
4849600 4851268 Thanks, Apollo.
4851352 4852853 You just make sure you wash them
4852936 4854372 before you bring<br />them back, all right?
4854396 4856106 Will do, will do.
4857483 4858859 Hey, thanks, Apollo.
4858942 4861820 And remember, after<br />this you owe me a favor.
4862988 4864365 What favor?
4864531 4865574 Bill, I have to agree.
4865657 4869661 Toe-to-toe, Lang is utterly<br />devastating and he's much too strong.
4871955 4874434 All right, listen. I just wanna<br />tell you that I'm proud of you.
4874458 4876102 It takes a hell of a man<br />to change, and you did it.
4876126 4877270 You're gonna prove<br />it to them tonight, right?
4877294 4878337 Right. Right.
4878420 4880130 You did good, Apollo.<br />Thanks, Paulie.
4880214 4882257 Okay, let's do it, Paulie.
4883926 4886261 And here comes Rocky,<br />and here comes Apollo,
4886345 4887763 the two former champions.
4887846 4890349 Look at that United<br />States Marine Corps Color Guard there
4890432 4891785 along with the Drum<br />and Bugle Corps.
4891809 4893018 Aren't they magnificent?
4893102 4894937 Tremendous. Take<br />a look at Rocky.
4895020 4897940 Look at the tenseness in his<br />face, the tautness of that body.
4898023 4899400 Boy does he look<br />serious right now!
4899483 4900776 Oh, that he certainly does.
4900859 4902736 And you know, Stu,<br />the word is that
4902820 4905656 this is Rocky's last fight,<br />win, lose or draw.
4905739 4908075 And there he is,<br />the Italian Stallion,
4908158 4910411 Rocky Balboa,<br />climbing into the ring.
4910494 4912454 Boy, he looks incredibly<br />thin, doesn't he?
4912538 4915082 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
4915165 4917918 Rocky Balboa,<br />the iron man from Philadelphia!
4918001 4920921 And this crowd is certainly<br />with him tonight. Listen.
4922840 4925008 Balboa doesn't really<br />have any boxing skill.
4925092 4926468 I've never seen<br />a fighter, though,
4926593 4928220 with as much raw determination.
4928303 4930222 Hold it, Stu.
4930305 4932766 And here comes the<br />champion now, Clubber Lang.
4932850 4934852 Listen to this crowd.
4936145 4937688 Take a look at those eyes.
4937771 4941942 I've never seen a guy with<br />such sullen eyes. He is tough.
4942025 4944570 Clubber, go back<br />where you came from!
4946363 4949241 He even belted a<br />spectator on the way in. Did you see that?
4949324 4950451 Look at that man.
4950534 4951577 Boy, awesome.
4951660 4954163 Awesome! Man, he's<br />tough. Look at that.
4954246 4957416 Clubber Lang, the<br />heavyweight champion of the world.
4957499 4958667 Keep it loose, keep it loose.
4958750 4960961 Hey, fool, you ready<br />for another beating?
4961044 4963172 You should've never came back.
4963255 4965966 Don't look at him.<br />Let's just be cool.
4966049 4968177 Hey, boy.
4968260 4970262 Hey, boy.
4970345 4972264 After I crucify him,<br />you're next.
4972347 4974308 Just stay out of my face, chump.
4974391 4975535 Don't turn your<br />back on me, sucker!
4975559 4977060 We got a brawl before the bell!
4977102 4979062 Apollo and Clubber go at it.
4979104 4980981 This ring is ready to explode.
4981064 4982858 The fight about<br />to officially begin
4982941 4984860 but these guys wanna start now.
4984943 4986653 Come on! Let me go! Let me go!
4986737 4987922 That's right, I'm gonna get you!
4987946 4989090 I'm gonna get you! Let him go!
4989114 4990407 Come on!
4990491 4992284 Let him go! I want<br />him! I want him!
4992409 4994328 I thought you said be<br />cool. That was cool.
4994411 4995954 I'm the champ! I'm the champ!
4996038 4997498 I'll beat you<br />like I did last time!
4997581 5000459 You won't have to<br />look to find me. I'm here.
5000542 5004296 Ladies, gentlemen<br />and boxing fans around the world,
5004379 5006924 welcome to Madison Square Garden
5007007 5010010 and tonight's heavyweight<br />championship of the world.
5011553 5012888 Oh, this crowd is ready tonight.
5012971 5018936 Out of the red corner,<br />the challenger, weighing 191 pounds
5020437 5023774 from the fighting<br />city of Philadelphia,
5023857 5027486 the former heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5027569 5034076 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5040457 5042417 I'll tell you something.<br />He has so slimmed down.
5042501 5043710 He looks like a middleweight.
5044753 5049925 Out of the blue corner,<br />weighing 237 pounds,
5050342 5053428 the hard-punching<br />battler from Chicago,
5053512 5057808 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5057891 5060644 Clubber Lang!
5061895 5064106 Referee Lou Filippo.
5064523 5066358 Okay, boys, let's go.
5067651 5069444 We went over<br />the rules yesterday.
5069528 5071048 I'm just going to<br />repeat a few of them.
5071363 5073907 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
5073991 5076910 In case of a knockdown, you<br />go to the corner I tell you to
5076994 5079454 and you stay there until<br />I tell you to come out.
5079538 5081999 Is that understood?<br />Any questions?
5082708 5085919 Okay. Let's go back to<br />your corner now. Let's go.
5086003 5087921 I'm gonna bust you up.
5088672 5090007 Go for it.
5092009 5094970 Well, here we go. The war is on.
5095053 5096638 We're just waiting for the bell.
5096722 5098724 Take my belt off. I'm<br />gonna get that chump.
5098807 5100767 Don't let this bum<br />let you fight his fight.
5100851 5102436 You're the best!<br />You're the best!
5102603 5104062 Here you go, champ.
5105188 5106548 Rhythm and power,<br />rhythm and power.
5107316 5108942 Keep that jab up. Thanks.
5109026 5112070 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5112154 5114406 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5114531 5116033 Are we ready for round one now?
5116074 5117242 Should be a great fight.
5117326 5119244 And here we go.
5119328 5122581 And he goes right out of<br />his corner after Clubber Lang!
5122664 5125250 He's throwing rights and<br />lefts into Clubber's face.
5125334 5126752 What a start of a fight here!
5126835 5129212 Another jab. Another jab.
5130380 5133133 And another! This<br />is not the Rocky we expected!
5133216 5134551 He looks fantastic.
5134635 5136428 He's fighting more<br />like Apollo Creed.
5139097 5140641 Another right!
5140724 5143769 A right! Look at that,<br />right and left to the head!
5143852 5146146 Clubber Lang doesn't<br />know what's happening right now.
5146229 5147981 He's being stung by this style.
5148065 5149941 Look at the shots he's taking.
5151652 5153070 I can't believe I'm saying this,
5153153 5155656 but he can't corner the<br />fleet-footed challenger.
5155739 5158075 It's absolutely unbelievable!
5159660 5160928 Come on, is that<br />the hardest you can hit?
5160952 5162412 Bring it to me! Come on! Hit me!
5162496 5165540 That right hand is<br />just like a trip hammer.
5169211 5170851 Rock, tie him up!<br />Bring it to me. Come on.
5171922 5173298 Break it up. Get back. Get back.
5173382 5174675 Come on. Get back.
5174758 5177386 Tough first round.<br />Tough first round.
5177469 5180847 It is Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts, right to the head of Lang.
5180931 5182015 Get off! Get off!
5182099 5183642 Now it's Lang coming back!
5183725 5186311 This crowd is<br />going absolutely wild!
5190816 5194194 There's a good left-right<br />combination by Rocky.
5194277 5195320 And a good left hand.
5195404 5196405 Go!
5199658 5202494 This is Rocky Balboa's night.
5211336 5212838 Getting him back to his corner.
5212921 5215924 We've got pandemonium in<br />the ring at the end of round one.
5216091 5217259 They're holding Lang back.
5217342 5218468 Lang wants more.
5218552 5220721 He can't realize<br />that the round is over.
5220804 5223348 He's trying to<br />get back to Rocky.
5223432 5225308 All right, all right,<br />you look great.
5225392 5226792 Just don't get crazy<br />and we're home.
5227978 5230522 I'll kill you, man!<br />The man's strong.
5230605 5233167 Tell me when's the next round.<br />I'm gonna Kill him! I'm gonna kill him!
5233191 5235193 I'm gonna kill him!
5235902 5237571 Now, he's gonna<br />come hard, right? Yeah.
5237654 5239757 You keep crowding<br />him. Don't give him a chance to set.
5239781 5242701 Counter and move.<br />Counter and move. Counter and move.
5242784 5244578 And he had Lang at his mercy.
5244661 5248081 I don't think Lang knew what<br />hit him there in this whole first round.
5248206 5250667 Here we go<br />now. The bell for round two.
5250751 5254838 Now it's Lang coming out for<br />Rocky at the starting of round two.
5256798 5259485 Here he comes back, but Rocky<br />is still landing those rights and lefts.
5259509 5262429 Right now in the center of<br />the ring, a right to the head.
5262512 5264806 Another right to the head.<br />He's really setting him up.
5264890 5266099 A right! Right! Right!
5266183 5267684 Five unanswered shots!
5269019 5270771 Kill him! Kill him!
5275400 5276693 Get out of there!
5276777 5278028 Get back there!
5282491 5284409 All right! All right!
5285619 5286971 - Get him off of him!<br />- Let's go now!
5286995 5289456 Come on, break it up!<br />Break it up!
5289539 5290624 What are you doing?
5290707 5292459 Come on! Come on, Balboa!
5292542 5294127 Come on. I'm gonna<br />give it to you!
5294211 5297798 Get those feet moving! Get<br />your hands up! Come on, Rock!
5297881 5299883 That right<br />hand hurt Rocky again.
5299966 5301802 What a fight!
5302385 5305931 He's got him cornered.<br />Balboa's a little in trouble now.
5310101 5312229 Hold him, damn it! Hold him!
5313688 5315148 Come on, Rocky, come on!
5315232 5316942 This is Clubber's round so far.
5317025 5318902 Lang's taken momentum here.
5320237 5322405 He's railing away at Balboa.
5323907 5326117 And Balboa is down!
5326201 5328995 You think you're bad?<br />Get up. Get up, damn it!
5329079 5330997 Come on! Come on! Five.
5331081 5332457 Can he get up? Can he get up?
5332541 5334209 He's in trouble, but he's up.
5334292 5335919 Six. Seven.
5337879 5340173 Here comes Clubber again.<br />Lang with the left hand.
5340257 5342759 Lang with another<br />left and now a right.
5342843 5345095 A right! Another right!<br />A right! Another right!
5345178 5347305 And down goes Balboa again.
5348890 5349975 Stop the fight.
5350058 5351726 You better stay down.
5352435 5354229 I got some moves if you get up.
5354312 5356523 I got a lot of moves. I got<br />a lot of moves. Come on.
5356606 5359150 Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
5359234 5361361 Come on, come on, fool.
5364281 5366324 You ain't<br />so bad. You ain't so bad.
5366408 5368368 You ain't so bad. Come on.
5368451 5370328 You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't nothing.
5370412 5371663 You must be crazy or something!
5371788 5373808 I'm crazy? Yeah, I may<br />be... You're just a stupid fool!
5373832 5375375 But I ain't breathing heavy.
5375458 5377878 He's a fool. He's stupid.
5377961 5380255 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
5380338 5382525 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?
5382549 5384801 Look, it's strategy, that's<br />all. I know what I'm doing.
5384885 5386344 No, you don't know<br />what you're doing!
5386428 5388054 He's gotta come to you.<br />You're the champ.
5388138 5390181 He's nothing. He's mine.
5390432 5392410 You stand toe-to-toe with<br />this bum and he'll kill you!
5392434 5394871 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />there and get their head beat off!
5394895 5396980 Don't... He's getting<br />tired. He's getting tired.
5397063 5400191 Don't go wasting your<br />punches. You're the champ.
5400275 5402068 Don't try to take him<br />out with one punch!
5402152 5403236 Use your head.
5403320 5405739 Now, you wear him<br />down. He's all ours.
5405822 5407675 I know what I'm doing, I<br />swear. I know what I'm doing.
5407699 5409367 Don't tell me what you think!
5409492 5410660 Go out there and do it, Rock.
5410702 5412120 Eye of the tiger.<br />You understand?
5412162 5413413 Yeah.
5413496 5414896 Go out there and<br />knock his head off.
5414956 5417083 He's just a man, Rock.<br />He's just a man.
5417959 5419794 Be more man than him!<br />Go get him.
5419878 5421755 Eye of the tiger!<br />Eye of the tiger!
5421922 5423340 Up and down. Side to side.
5423423 5425550 All right, this is<br />the beginning of round three.
5425634 5427802 Tough rounds to call right now.
5427886 5429512 This is a little<br />slower in the start.
5429596 5431848 It's my round. It's my round.
5431932 5433266 I'm gonna take you this time.
5433350 5437062 I'm gonna take you.<br />You're mine. You're mine.
5437187 5440023 Come on. Come on. I'm gonna<br />get you. I'm gonna get you.
5443193 5446321 And Rocky throws him three rights<br />to the head and a left. He is back.
5446404 5449282 He's your heavyweight.
5451993 5454329 Rock, get out of there! Get out!
5456039 5458541 A sharp left-hand<br />right to the head.
5459376 5461294 Get out of there!
5461378 5462671 Come on.
5462754 5464297 Stick him! Stick him!
5467050 5468802 Come on! Come on!
5469427 5470595 Come on!
5470679 5472389 Again, again!
5472597 5474516 He's getting killed.<br />Oh, no, no, no.
5474599 5476518 He's not getting killed,<br />he's getting mad!
5476601 5478371 Come on, whole world's<br />watching. Knock me out.
5478395 5480563 Come on, knock me out.
5480689 5483650 Come on, harder. Hit me<br />hard. Hit me harder. Come on!
5486945 5489030 No!
5490740 5492450 Get out of there!
5494786 5495954 Rocky!
5498748 5500959 Come on, Rock. Hands up, Rock.
5501751 5502836 Yeah.
5504087 5505648 My mother hits harder<br />than that. Come on.
5505672 5507232 A little harder. A<br />little harder, champ.
5507298 5508800 In the face. Come on.
5508883 5510468 Again, come on, champ.
5510552 5513096 Again, come on,<br />champ. You ain't so bad!
5513179 5517100 You ain't nothing!<br />You ain't nothing!
5517976 5520353 Rocky! Rocky!
5535076 5536995 I might believe<br />the strategy now.
5537078 5540373 He's making Clubber Lang miss<br />now. You see how he drew him in?
5540457 5542292 Now Rocky's<br />throwing the punches!
5545045 5547297 Look at that! He's lifting<br />him right off the canvas
5547380 5550133 with those powerful<br />punches to the ribs.
5554262 5557474 He's coming. He's completely<br />psyched-out this guy.
5558433 5561144 Lang has got to be<br />confused by all of this.
5563229 5566983 Look at the condition Balboa is<br />in right now. Look at the condition.
5567067 5569069 Somehow he's roared back.
5573448 5576618 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
5577243 5579037 Harder punches! Now!
5579120 5581372 What a comeback by Balboa!
5588755 5590381 Come on. Come on.
5591508 5593301 Come on. Come on.
5594844 5596721 Come on. Come on!
5598640 5599891 Yeah!
5606606 5608691 The place has gone bananas!
5608775 5610777 It's a tremendous comeback!
5610860 5612153 Get up!
5612237 5615448 Five. Six. Seven.
5615532 5616699 Seven.
5616783 5618952 Eight. Nine. Nine.
5619035 5621704 Ten. You're out!
5623081 5625083 The new heavyweight<br />champion again!
5625166 5627627 He's down on the<br />floor in ecstasy!
5628002 5630630 Bowing, praying there,<br />beating the floor!
5630713 5634134 And there he is, the new<br />heavyweight champion of the world,
5634217 5636970 Rocky Balboa!
5639347 5641224 Rocky is exhausted!
5643726 5645270 We did it!
5646521 5649899 Ladies and<br />gentlemen, the winner by knockout...
5650233 5651901 Are you all right?
5652068 5654237 Never better. Never better.
5654320 5658491 Once again the heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5658575 5664205 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5672714 5674340 Come on, come on!<br />We made a deal.
5674424 5676634 I know, but<br />this is extremely crazy.
5676718 5677778 Yeah, it's mentally<br />irregular, right?
5677802 5678803 Yeah.
5678887 5680322 But it makes all<br />the sense in the world.
5680346 5681681 You owe me a favor.
5681764 5684601 I know, but when did<br />you think of this?
5684684 5686436 About three years ago.
5686519 5688354 This is very crazy, Apollo.
5688438 5689522 Look, Stallion.
5689606 5692483 Now look, when you won that<br />last fight, you won by one second.
5692567 5694194 You beat me by one<br />second. One second.
5694277 5696338 That's very hard for a man<br />of my intelligence to handle.
5696362 5699824 Is it? But didn't you say after I beat<br />you, you learned how to live with it?
5699908 5701784 I lied. Oh, you lied.
5703119 5705413 So now you just gotta<br />prove it to yourself?
5705496 5706497 Just for myself.
5706581 5708708 No TV, No newspapers,<br />just you and me.
5708791 5710210 Nothing. Just you and me.
5710293 5711669 Age before beauty.
5711753 5712962 Anything you say, Stallion.
5713046 5714714 I'll do all the work, okay.
5715256 5717217 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow
5717300 5719552 because you ain't as young<br />as springtime any more.
5719636 5722013 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, Stallion.
5722096 5724182 Oh, yeah? Well, how<br />you gonna do that?
5724265 5725808 You taught me<br />everything you know.
5725934 5727477 Almost everything.
5727560 5729520 You gotta remember<br />now, you fight great,
5729604 5732106 but I'm a great fighter.<br />You ready?
5732815 5734067 Absolutely.
5734150 5735318 All right.
5735401 5738863 You know, Stallion, it's too<br />bad we gotta get old, huh?
5740990 5743159 Just keep punching, Apollo.
5744994 5746746 Wanna ring the bell?
5746996 5748331 All right.
5748498 5749958 Ding, ding.
5751668 5753336 Come on, Stallion.
5754254 5756422 Come on. Come on.
5756506 5759592 Boy, you really move<br />good for an older guy.
5760760 5762345 You're looking good, Stallion.
5762428 5763972 I taught you well.
5764055 5766015 I think you taught me too good.
5766099 5768059 Looking fly. Look out now.
5768142 5769769 No, no.<br />You don't want any of this.
5769852 5771521 Come on. Come on.
5772230 5774065 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
5774190 5775733 Come on, watch yourself. Ready?
5777318 5780530 It's the eye of<br />the tiger It's the thrill of the fight
5780613 5784951 Risin' up to the challenge<br />of our rival
5785034 5789372 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
5789455 5796296 And he's watchin' us all<br />with the eye of the tiger
5799549 5803386 Risin' up back on the street
5804012 5807223 Did my time, took my chances
5808474 5811686 Went the distance,<br />now I'm back on my feet
5811769 5815565 Just a man and<br />his will to survive
5816649 5820445 So many times,<br />it happens too fast
5820987 5824240 You trade your passion for glory
5825408 5829245 Don't lose your grip<br />on the dreams of the past
5829329 5833458 You must fight<br />just to keep them alive
5833541 5837920 It's the eye of the tiger<br />It's the thrill of the fight
5838004 5842342 Risin' up to the challenge<br />of our rival
5842425 5846763 And the last known survivor<br />stalks his prey in the night
5846846 5853561 And he's watchin' us all<br />with the eye of the tiger
5857023 5860276 Face to face, out in the heat
5861444 5864113 Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
5865615 5869035 They stack the odds<br />till we take to the street
5869118 5872872 For we kill with<br />the skill to survive
