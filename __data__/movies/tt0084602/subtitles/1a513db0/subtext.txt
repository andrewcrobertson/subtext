411342 413275 I want a shot at the title.
413343 416244 If Balboa's got the guts, he'll meet<br />me in the ring or anywhere else.
416378 419612 My whole life's been directed towards<br />this here title, and nothin' else.
419679 421613 I live alone, and I train alone.
421681 423815 I'll win the title alone.<br />I want him.
423850 427384 He can't duck me forever.<br />He can run, but he can't hide.
427452 429386 Well, another Southpaw,
429454 433056 Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa doesn't<br />seem to be worried about much these days.
433123 435457 He's just defended his title<br />for the tenth time...
435524 438459 And now he's even agreed to take on the<br />World's Heavyweight Wrestling Champion...
438526 440461 In a sort of charity benefit,
440528 443362 with all the proceeds to go<br />to a local youth foundation.
443430 445197 Now, I'll have to give him credit.
445265 448900 Mr. Balboa manages to stay busy.<br />He's a true sportsman.
448968 451201 And it looks like the number<br />one contender, Clubber Lang,
451269 453303 will have to continue<br />to play the waiting game.
453371 455838 But that should be a great,<br />great match up.
455905 457840 Take it easy, okay?
457908 461909 The word is "Awesome."<br />Introducing the newest Datsun Z-Car.

662817 664811 used to laugh at ya<br />because you were so jive.

1198849 1202117 Now the fans are outraged too.
1202184 1206036 I'm gonna drag him<br />down now like a dirty rag!
1206104 1208788 You weakling, Balboa!
1208856 1211056 I'm coming after you!
1212291 1215059 You okay?
1215127 1218911 Now the security guards are rushing<br />in, trying to stop this slaughter.
1218979 1222064 Teeth are flying everywhere!<br />Why? You finished?
1222132 1225433 Come on, cut my gloves off.
1225501 1229102 That place is a zoo!
1229170 1232238 This place has turned into a zoo!<br />This is very, very..
1232305 1234840 want me to get a doctor?<br />You sure?
1235041 1237858 The girls have gotten into it now.
1237926 1240578 They're getting beat up too!
1240645 1243312 Where are you going, you fool?<br />Be right back.
1243314 1245113 You're a maniac!<br />Come back here!
1245181 1246782 What are you doing?
1246850 1250351 Come back here!<br />Hey, come on, you!
1250353 1253486 Out of the way, worms! Come on!
1255556 1258090 Come on! Come on!
1262127 1264762 All right, Thunderlips,<br />break it up!
1265096 1268064 No choking!<br />No choking!
1268131 1271099 Aah!<br />Paulie, help!
1275570 1277571 I don't sweat you!
1283676 1286459 Hang on!<br />Hang on there, Kid!
1286527 1290145 How do you like it, huh?
1290213 1293815 You're kinda cute.<br />I don't need this.
1293883 1296217 Rocky is out and out strangling him.
1296586 1298385 Rocky hanging on like a bull terrier.
1298587 1301721 Now he's got him in a stranglehold.
1302089 1305123 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1305191 1307959 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1308026 1311260 The body!
1316099 1320101 Knock his block off!
1325639 1328139 Timber!<br />No!
1330275 1333944 It's unbelievable!<br />Rocky actually did it!
1334012 1337546 The human skyscraper's been<br />thrown out of the ring!
1337615 1339748 All right, that's it.<br />Time is up.
1339816 1341717 Get outta my way!
1341784 1343918 Break it up!<br />Break it up!
1343986 1347988 Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />we have a draw. A draw.
1349322 1351924 Thank you, one and all, for attending...
1351992 1355893 The 12th Annual Charity Match between<br />the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa,
1355960 1357995 and Thunderlips, the Ultimate Male.
1358062 1360462 See you next year.<br />Thank God.
1360631 1362698 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, pretty good.
1362766 1366533 Good match.<br />Why'd you get so crazy on me out there?
1366601 1368702 That's the name of the game.
1368770 1371971 While you're still calm,<br />can we get that polaroid together?
1372139 1374071 Yeah, sure.
1374138 1378107 Adrian, come on over here.<br />My wife Adrian, my kid.
1378175 1380442 That's Thunderlips. Al, would<br />you do that? That hurt.
1380509 1382678 Okay, that's all right.
1382745 1386380 You know,<br />sometimes charity really hurts.
1389717 1392417 And this Pinocchio,<br />he told a lie, you see,
1392485 1394418 and his nose started<br />growin' real big.
1394486 1397388 Why didn't his ears grow?<br />I don't know.
1397456 1400523 I didn't write the story.<br />Are you fighting again?
1400592 1403325 Today? No, I don't plan<br />on fightin' today.
1403393 1405827 Promise? Promise.<br />Definitely I promise.
1405895 1407829 Good.<br />I like you here.
1407897 1410931 Yeah? I like Bein' here.<br />Are you gettin' hungry, huh?
1410999 1413666 You want some breakfast?<br />You want wheaties? Yeah.
1413734 1415667 What are Wheaties, huh?<br />Champions.
1415735 1418636 Breakfast of what? Champions.<br />Champions.
1418704 1421973 And the father bear, he says,<br />"Somebody's been sleepin' in my bed."
1422039 1423974 And the little kid bear said,
1424041 1427242 "Somebody's been sleepin'<br />in my bed, and there she is."
1427310 1429243 Thereby he pulls back the covers...
1429311 1433080 And thereby exposing her to the,<br />you know, public, see?
1433147 1435215 Come on, eat your cereal<br />before it sinks.
1435282 1437282 Then what happened to Goldilocks?
1437350 1439284 What happened to her?<br />I'm not exactly sure.
1439352 1442121 Busted for trespassin',<br />and got 30 days in the clink.
1442147 1443478 That's real nice, Paulie.
1443622 1446123 That's nice to tell the kid.<br />Rocky?
1446125 1448925 Rocky, the car is waiting. Okay.
1448993 1451392 You guys better go.<br />Be a good boy now.
1451460 1454128 We'll have a fun time, me and the kid.<br />All right.
1454195 1457230 Oh, Mrs. Stallion,<br />you almost look pretty good.
1457297 1461299 Oh, thank you, Paulie. Don't give<br />the kid any beer, all right?
1461367 1465269 Okay, we gotta go. And, Paulie, don't<br />take him to the track, all right?
1465337 1467904 How ya doin', Mick?<br />Pretty good.
1469440 1472008 Now, we got a problem in the seventh.
1492657 1496658 whatever happened to them quiet,<br />tender moments, huh?
1513237 1515939 Thank you.<br />Thank you, one and all.
1516006 1520341 Every once in a while, a person<br />comes along who defies the odds,
1520409 1523177 who defies logic...
1523244 1526612 And fulfills an incredible dream.
1526680 1530215 On behalf of all the<br />citizens of Philadelphia,
1530283 1532951 and the many who have been touched<br />by your accomplishments...
1533019 1535687 And your untiring participation...
1535754 1538121 In this city's many charity functions,
1538189 1541724 it is with tremendous honor<br />that we present this memorial,
1541792 1545060 which will stand always as a celebration...
1545127 1548361 To the indomitable spirit of man.
1548429 1550830 Philadelphia salutes<br />its favorite son,
1550898 1553166 Rocky Balboa!
1564208 1566175 It's beautiful.
1566242 1568609 Definitely a thing of beauty.
1568677 1572979 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1573047 1576015 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1576083 1579317 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!

1583554 1586055 Thank you.
1589592 1591993 Thank you very much.
1596296 1600498 I don't know what.. What do you<br />say to somethin' like this?
1602168 1604168 About three years ago,
1605437 1608605 this city...
1608672 1612108 Really took me inside, you know?
1613642 1618411 And I want to thank you very much for that.<br />I really do.
1618479 1621614 And I've been thinkin' that, uh,
1621681 1624616 I wasn't gonna bring this up,<br />but I might as well now.
1624683 1627985 I would never do anything to..
1628053 1631855 To hurt this sport that has been...
1631922 1633857 So really good to me.
1633924 1636758 And I've been talkin'<br />it over with my wife...
1637893 1639894 And my manager,
1639962 1642996 and we think that..
1643064 1647366 Well, it's really hard to..<br />I feel like, well..
1647433 1651302 I'm thinkin' maybe<br />it's time that I should, uh,
1651370 1656205 step down maybe and...<br />Retire.
1656273 1658074 No!
1658142 1660475 No! No!
1660542 1663077 Gettin' out while you can?
1663144 1665945 Don't give this sucker no statue.<br />Give him guts!
1666013 1668882 I told you I wasn't goin' away.<br />You got your shot.
1668949 1671383 Now give me mine. Why don't<br />you get the hell outta there!
1671450 1673384 Shut up, Old Man!<br />I ain't goin' nowhere.
1673451 1675552 Now why don't you tell all these<br />nice folks why you been duckin' me.
1675620 1680055 Politics, Man. This country wants to<br />keep me down, keep everybody weak.
1680057 1681674 They don't want a man like<br />me to have the title,
1681700 1683249 because I'm not a puppet<br />like that fool there.
1683292 1685326 You know, you've got a big mouth.
1685394 1687995 Why don't you come out and<br />close it, Balboa? Come on!
1688062 1691764 Any time.<br />The guy's crazy. Don't listen to him.
1691832 1693506 If the little man don't<br />wanna come to me,
1693532 1695325 then I'll come to you<br />and lay out the truth.
1695367 1698635 I am ranked number one. One!<br />That means I'm the best.
1698703 1701637 But this bum is takin' the easy<br />matches, fightin' other bums.
1701705 1703972 I'm telling you and everybody here...
1704040 1706809 I'll fight him anywhere,<br />any time, for nothin'.
1709377 1712979 But you people ain't never gonna see<br />that happen because he's gonna retire.
1713047 1715314 You see,<br />he don't fight no real man.
1715381 1717216 He fight them set ups.<br />What?
1717284 1719150 You're a disgrace to this sport!
1719218 1722286 Shut up, Old Man! You and that chump<br />don't know where I had to come from.
1722353 1724288 Balboa, your family doin'<br />real nice, ain't it?
1724355 1726322 You call yourself a fighter.<br />Prove it now.
1726389 1730192 Give me the same chance. The way you<br />been duckin' this is a disgrace.
1730259 1732993 If he ain't no coward,<br />why don't he fight me then?
1733061 1736495 I can't listen to any more of this.<br />I don't care what you're ranked.
1736563 1738731 You don't get no shot,<br />and I mean that!
1738798 1740813 I'm glad you're seein' this.<br />What are you doin'?
1740839 1741825 I wanna fight this guy.
1741867 1745135 Well, you've got him.<br />But you've got him without me.
1745202 1747703 What are you sayin'?<br />It's finished.
1747771 1750338 Yes, I'm finished.<br />I don't want no more of this.
1750406 1753741 I don't want no more of it.<br />You understand? None of it!
1753809 1756810 It's all over with!<br />Judge me by my fightin' record.
1756877 1760045 Hey, Woman. Hey, Woman.<br />Listen here.
1760112 1763781 Since your man ain't got no heart,<br />maybe you'd like to see a real man.
1763849 1767183 I bet you stay up late every night<br />dreamin' you had a real man, don't you?
1767251 1769185 I'll tell you what.
1769253 1770772 Bring your pretty<br />little self over to my
1770798 1772613 apartment tonight, and<br />I'll show you a real man.
1772656 1774956 You want it, you got it!
1777659 1781761 Any time!<br />You got it!
1788166 1790100 Rocky, don't.<br />Come on.
1790168 1793169 Rocky, please, let's go talk.<br />Hey, Adrian.
1794171 1797405 Rocky.<br />Let's talk.
1800976 1804143 Why'd you leave?<br />Why'd you walk away like that?
1804211 1806144 Life's too short, Kid.
1806212 1808180 Where are you goin'?
1808247 1811816 I'm goin' on a permanent vacation.
1811883 1814284 What are you talkin' about?<br />We got one more fight.
1814352 1818020 No, not we.<br />You.
1818088 1820421 Why are you doin' this?
1823892 1826626 I said, why are you doin' this?
1826694 1828962 Because you can't win, Rock!
1829029 1832163 This guy'll kill you to death<br />inside of three rounds!
1832231 1834799 You're crazy.<br />What else is new?
1834867 1838034 He's just another fighter.<br />No, he ain't just another fighter.
1838102 1841570 This guy is a wreckin' machine,<br />and he's hungry.
1841638 1844372 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
1844439 1846707 What are you talkin' about?<br />I've had ten title defenses.
1846774 1849075 That was easy.<br />What do you mean, easy?
1849143 1852011 They was hand picked!
1854113 1856882 Set ups? No, they weren't set ups.
1856949 1860683 They was good fighters, but they<br />wasn't killers like this guy.
1860751 1864020 He'll knock you into tomorrow, Rock.
1883367 1885367 Geez, Mick.
1886937 1889137 Why'd you do it?
1891040 1896108 Because the beating that you got from<br />Apollo should've killed you, Kid.
1896176 1898110 It didn't.
1898178 1902547 It was my job to keep you<br />winnin' and to keep you healthy.
1907451 1911253 You really don't think I got<br />nothin' left, do you?
1911320 1913988 Well, Rock, let's..
1914056 1916823 Well, let's put it this way.
1916891 1920860 Now, three years ago,<br />you was supernatural.
1920928 1924295 You was.. You was hard,<br />and you was nasty...
1924363 1928298 And you had this cast iron jaw.
1928366 1930299 But then,
1930367 1932802 the worst thing happened to you...
1932870 1935804 That could happen to any fighter.
1935872 1938372 You got civilized.
1943744 1945844 Oh, don't worry, Kid.
1945912 1948613 You know, Presidents retire,
1948681 1952515 Generals retire, horses retire.
1952584 1954650 Man O'War retired.
1954718 1957887 They put him out to stud.
1957955 1960956 That's what you should've<br />done, retire.
1964459 1967460 I can't retire<br />knowin' all this, Mick.
1967527 1970596 Oh, don't push it.<br />Well, you been carryin' me.
1970663 1974298 We don't need it.<br />You've been carryin' me, though.
1974365 1978068 I haven't been carryin' ya.<br />I been protectin' ya.
1978135 1980970 No, it's not the way..<br />I want this fight, just one more.
1981037 1984371 But we don't need it.<br />I'll live in the gym.
1984439 1987674 We don't need it.<br />Mick, I do.
1987742 1990342 And I'm askin' you to<br />train me one last time.
1990410 1992511 Oh, no, I can't.
1992579 1994779 If you don't, uh,
1994847 1998381 I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't bought<br />a new pair of underwear in ten years.
1998449 2001450 You would, wouldn't you?
2001518 2004352 Yeah, absolutely.
2006589 2008522 No, no, no.
2008590 2011057 Come on.
2011125 2014392 One more time, then it's over.
2014460 2016729 It's a deal?<br />Come on.
2016796 2019931 It's your head, Kid.<br />It's your head.

2220139 2223140 Side to side, Rock!<br />Side..
2223208 2226609 Shut up back there, can't you?<br />Change your tune.

2228779 2231914 That's it, Kid.<br />You're a deadly weapon. Time!
2231981 2234415 Time, time, time.<br />Quit it.

2236918 2239853 Here, put this on before<br />you catch pneumonia. Okay.
2239921 2241921 I'll give you a little rubdown,<br />too. Yeah.
2241988 2243922 Hey, listen, Kid.
2243989 2247691 I-I don't like to hear much of<br />what comes out of people's mouths,
2247759 2251594 and I don't like soft talkin' moments.<br />That's for sure.
2251661 2255964 You know, but I just wanted to tell<br />you one thing.. That I'm proud of ya.
2256032 2258099 Well, thanks a lot.
2258166 2260667 That's all right, Kid.<br />Let's get outta here.
2260736 2262668 Eh, Mick?<br />Yeah?
2262737 2265170 What do you think we're gonna<br />do when it's all over, huh?
2265238 2268005 I don't know.<br />Maybe join up with a circus.
2268073 2271109 Yeah, maybe. All right, let's go.
2276479 2279347 Good evening, Everyone.<br />Along with Bill Baldwin,
2279414 2282615 I'm Stu Nahan, and we welcome you to<br />tonight's Heavyweight Title Fight,
2282683 2285185 which may prove to be<br />the most memorable of all.
2285251 2289420 For tonight is the champion's final and<br />perhaps most difficult title defense.
2289488 2291622 Rocky, do you feel you're in<br />the best shape of your career?
2291690 2293623 Oh, yeah, absolutely.<br />I feel real good.
2293691 2296792 He's a deadly weapon. He's one<br />of a kind, and he's gonna do it.
2296860 2298627 Clubber, do you think<br />you're as fast as Balboa?
2298695 2301129 I'll do my talkin' in the ring!<br />Clubber, dance for us.
2303664 2306966 You better get outta here!<br />I wanna be alone!
2307034 2309901 Will you retire after this fight?<br />This is the last one.
2309969 2313304 After this, me and Mick are finished.<br />This is definitely the last one.
2313372 2316374 Clubber.. You're parasites and leeches!<br />Get outta here!
2316441 2319642 What will you do after tonight?
2319710 2323544 I'm not sure. Maybe join<br />the circus, eh, Mick?
2323612 2325712 Yeah.<br />Have some fun.
2325780 2328581 Come on, take your robe off!
2328649 2332167 I told you to get outta my face!
2332235 2334810 With us this evening is<br />the Former Heavyweight
2334836 2336863 Champion of the World, Apollo Creed.
2336905 2338489 Do you have any predictions<br />on this fight?
2338556 2340491 How do you see this fight<br />going tonight?
2340558 2342992 I feel its strength would<br />have to go to the challenger,
2343060 2345994 while experience and the world's hardest<br />head would have to go to Rocky Balboa.
2346062 2347995 And you know I know about that.
2348062 2351165 Now remember, Rock.<br />Don't trade with this guy.
2351233 2353099 Take your time, wear him down,
2353167 2355600 but don't stand toe to toe with him.<br />Mm hmm.
2355668 2358836 This punk's never been<br />15 rounds before.
2358904 2361705 Take him good. Take him good.<br />Okay. I will.
2361772 2363706 That's it.
2363774 2365741 So I predict that<br />the Champ's gonna take it.
2365808 2368144 Now wait a minute. Do you really think<br />the champion can hit that hard?
2368211 2370845 Why do you think I'm<br />sittin' out here with you?
2387708 2390125 Hey, Sucker!
2390193 2392377 Balboa, you gone!<br />You finished!
2392444 2394862 You washed up! I'm the<br />baddest in the world!
2394930 2397864 You're not so bad to me.<br />What you say, Paper Champion?
2397932 2400016 I'm gonna beat you like a dog!
2400083 2402484 Can't you get that ape<br />back into the ring?
2402602 2404702 You made me wait too long!<br />You gonna pay!
2404770 2406438 Come on, Mouth!
2406505 2410274 Get him outta there, can't you?<br />Get him outta there!
2413077 2416661 Let me go! Let me go! Get outta my way!<br />Get outta my way!
2416728 2419746 You know who I am?<br />You know who I am?
2419814 2423416 I'm the man! I'm the man!<br />You're nothin' but dead meat!
2423584 2425834 I'll get you in the ring, Sucker!<br />You're dead meat!
2425919 2428702 Let go!
2429088 2432689 Oh! Rocky!<br />Rocky!
2432756 2434657 What's wrong?<br />It's his heart.
2434725 2437592 What's wrong, Adrian?<br />Get a doctor!
2437660 2439694 Somebody get a doctor!<br />Come on!
2441730 2444465 Sit here, Mick.<br />Get 'em outta here!

2471118 2474018 Will you please get a doctor, Paulie?<br />He's on his way.
2474086 2476098 Mick, I can't go out there<br />and fight like this.

2587167 2589100 All right, Fans, here we go.
2589168 2593370 Presenting to you, on my left, out of<br />the blue corner, hailing from Chicago,
2593438 2598773 weighing in at an even 235 pounds,<br />the world's number one challenger,
2598841 2601610 I wonder how Mick's doin'.
2601678 2604545 The undefeated Clubber Lang!
2604613 2608281 I'm the best. I'm the best!
2608349 2611317 You and clubber exchanged words up there.<br />Any comment?
2611384 2613318 I have no comment.
2613385 2615953 And his opponent,<br />in the opposite corner,
2616020 2619538 really needing no introduction<br />to the world over.
2619606 2622824 He weighs in at a trim 201 pounds.
2623175 2625327 The pride of Philadelphia,
2625394 2627828 the Italian Stallion...
2627895 2631931 And the reigning Heavyweight<br />Champion of the World,
2631998 2635166 Rocky Balboa!
2638770 2642539 Listen to this crowd.
2645775 2648776 Now to give instructions in<br />the middle of the ring,
2648778 2652345 the referee, Marty Denkin.
2653547 2656981 Clubber, Rocky, you know the rules.<br />I want a good, clean fight.
2657049 2659983 When I tell you to break, I want you<br />to step back at my command and break.
2660051 2662719 Now go back to the corner and<br />come out fighting at the bell.
2664120 2666287 Dead meat.
2670759 2674260 This is not gonna be a fight<br />of finesse.
2674328 2676260 These are two guys that<br />really throw punches.
2676286 2677588 This could end with one punch.
2677630 2680130 Chump's scared. Yeah. Hang him up.
2680198 2682198 See the look in his eyes?
2683400 2685601 Rocky, I'm no trainer.
2685669 2689270 Just go out and kill the guy.<br />Kill him, Rock.
2689338 2691906 He's scared.
2691974 2695476 I'm the new champion, I tell ya.<br />I'm the new champ as of today!
2695543 2697477 The Italian Stallion,<br />a rugged champion,
2697544 2700445 in the final fight of his<br />colorful career tonight.
2700513 2703981 Jimmy London was correct.<br />He looks like.. Well, just great.
2704132 2707283 Here we go. Oh, boy!
2707418 2709285 The Champion came out swinging!
2709353 2712020 Balboa's off to an incredible start.
2712371 2715122 He looks determined to destroy<br />the bigger challenger.
2715190 2718641 Get him, Rock! Get him!
2718709 2721193 Get in there!<br />Move him back!
2724897 2727513 Defense!
2727515 2732001 Now it's Balboa!<br />They're goin' at each other!
2733904 2736772 You got him!<br />You got him, Rock!
2736906 2739273 Double him up!<br />Double him up!
2741075 2744076 Come on!<br />Come on, Boy!
2744144 2746745 Come on!
2746813 2750581 The challenger is hitting him<br />with everything he's got.
2750583 2753049 Oh!
2754719 2757686 Come on, Balboa.<br />You made me wait!
2757754 2761255 Come on, Balboa!
2765359 2767627 He hobbles away,
2767928 2771430 trying to get himself to his corner.<br />Grab him, Paulie.
2773131 2774732 Where's Mick?<br />Where's Mick?
2774800 2777400 He's okay.<br />I need him here.
2777467 2780235 He ain't nothin'!<br />I told you he ain't nothin'!
2780303 2783971 He's too strong. Don't talk<br />like that, Rocko. Come on.
2784039 2786807 Tear him up! I'm gonna smoke him.<br />I'm gonna smoke him.
2786874 2789509 I can't keep him off.<br />I can't keep him off.
2789577 2792611 He's mine! He's mine!<br />I'm gonna get him!
2792679 2795313 I'm losin' it, Paulie.<br />Where's Mick?
2796881 2799650 What do you got there?<br />200 over 50.
2799717 2802552 All right, let's start CPR.
2802903 2804719 Come on, you can do it. I'll try.
2804787 2808388 Waiting for round two.<br />Rocky appears to be staggering.
2808457 2810390 I'll get him.
2810458 2813326 Coming out of the corner,<br />here comes Clubber!
2813394 2816328 Rocky! Rocky! Let's go!
2816463 2819163 Come on, Balboa!<br />Come on, you Stupid Hick!
2819465 2822198 Give it to me! Let's see<br />if you can give it to me!
2824469 2827069 Move on the inside!<br />Piece of cake!
2827136 2829820 The Champion is nearly helpless.
2829888 2832505 What a beating he's taking!
2834325 2836676 A left to the head!
2836743 2840027 Don't stand toe to toe with him!<br />Come on, Balboa!
2853689 2856790 Back off!
2856858 2859792 Come on, get up!
2859860 2862695 Four, get up, Italian!<br />Come on, Scooby Doo!

2870834 2874068 The champion is<br />finished in the second round!
2874136 2876505 It's unbelievable, incredible!<br />I beat Balboa!
2876572 2879607 Incredible upset! Balboa in<br />the corner, out on his feet!
2879674 2883009 Out of the fight!
2885962 2887612 We have the time.

2922270 2924704 He wouldn't go to the hospital<br />till you got here. What?
2924772 2928207 Mr. Balboa, time is important. We must<br />get him to the hospital immediately.
2928275 2930308 Okay.
2943118 2945052 Mick?
2945120 2947120 What?
2949590 2952258 What?<br />What, what, what?

2968270 2970271 Second round.
2972873 2975641 Yeah, I knew it.<br />That's good.
2975708 2979277 We did it, huh? We did it.<br />We did it.
2979344 2981811 You don't have to worry<br />about nothin' no more.
2981879 2984214 Everything's gonna be okay, Mick.
2984282 2986215 Yeah.<br />We did it.
2986283 2988849 Mick, you just gotta<br />get to the hospital.
2988917 2991286 You're not as young as<br />you used to be, okay?
2991353 2993853 You're the winner.<br />(Mumbles)
2993921 2996155 We did everything right.<br />No, we..
2996223 2999558 I did everything right. No, listen to me.<br />You done everything right.
2999692 3001793 Listen, we got more to do.
3001860 3005196 Mick, whatever you wanna do,<br />we'll do it, okay?
3005263 3009015 I love ya, Kid.<br />I love ya.
3009082 3011016 Mick?
3011083 3013083 It hurts me.
3015353 3017353 Mick?
3020857 3022858 Mick!
3030764 3032765 Mickey!
3036234 3039502 Mick!<br />(Mumbles)
3039671 3043105 (Mumbling)
3043173 3045106 Oh, God.
3052379 3055547 (Mumbling)
3062753 3065688 Oh, my God!
3065755 3069023 Oh, Jesus!
3077330 3080298 (Hebrew)
3080365 3082365 (Hebrew)
3098512 3103214 (Hebrew)
3103216 3105482 (Hebrew)
3105550 3107718 (Hebrew)
3126599 3130734 This concludes our service.
3234242 3236242 Hmm!
3243982 3245982 Aah!
3304058 3306558 That's not the way to do it.
3306626 3309293 Who's that?
3309361 3313096 Why don't you hit it straight?<br />Step into it.
3313164 3315865 Apollo?
3315932 3317900 Right.
3317968 3321235 I waited at your house for about an hour,<br />and your wife said you might be here.
3321303 3323786 What are you doin' here?
3323854 3325854 Business.
3327491 3331593 If the papers knew we were talkin'<br />like this, they'd think we was crazy.
3331660 3333594 Why you?
3333661 3336563 'Cause I'm the best, and you need<br />somebody to teach you different.
3336630 3341066 Why? To be honest with you, I don't<br />think you could pull it off without me.
3341134 3343374 You still didn't give<br />me the answer, Apollo.
3343400 3344594 What's the real reason?
3345837 3349506 Listen.<br />It's quiet, isn't it?
3349574 3351507 When you're retired,<br />it's too quiet.
3351575 3354375 I mean, we're too young<br />to retire, anyway.
3354443 3356522 Besides, with the right touch,<br />I could promote
3356548 3358537 this thing into the<br />biggest gig of all time.
3358580 3360514 It'd be bigger than ours.
3360582 3365383 Heaven knows, I-I don't mind Bein'<br />involved with large numbers, right?
3366652 3369320 I don't need this no more. I..
3369387 3373456 I don't want this no more.<br />Look, Man.
3373524 3377459 When you beat me, I hurt all over,
3377527 3381028 and I didn't wanna know from nothin'<br />or nobody, not even my kids.
3381096 3383896 Hell, every fighter knows that hurt.
3383964 3387099 And we get sick inside tryin' to<br />live with it, so don't back off now.
3387167 3390335 Make it right for yourself,<br />or you'll be sorry you didn't.
3390402 3395205 We held the greatest title<br />in the whole world, Babe.
3395273 3398807 You lost that fight, Rock,<br />for all the wrong reasons.
3398875 3400808 You lost your edge.
3400876 3402960 All right,
3403027 3406796 I know your manager dying<br />had you all messed up inside.
3406863 3410499 But the truth is,<br />you didn't look hungry.
3410567 3413767 Now when we fought,
3413835 3416603 you had that eye of the tiger,<br />Man, the edge.
3416670 3419372 And now you gotta get it back,<br />and the way to get it back...
3419440 3422007 Is to go back to the beginning,<br />you know what I mean?
3424076 3426578 Maybe we could win it back together.
3428079 3430646 Eye of the tiger, Man.
3433749 3435884 Why'd you have to come here?
3436752 3440387 I have a plan.<br />Get back, Man.
3442289 3444389 You got me curious.
3446225 3448559 You got me curious, Rock.
3452697 3457132 Clubber, do you accept the challenge<br />for a rematch with Balboa?
3457200 3460468 I reject the challenge,<br />because Balboa is no challenge.
3460535 3462970 But I'd be more than happy<br />to beat up on him some more.
3463037 3464972 Always said he was nothin'.
3465039 3467673 I can't wait to see this bum fall.
3467741 3471175 What do you think of him being<br />trained by Apollo Creed? Apollo who?
3471243 3473427 You talkin' about that<br />old fool, Apollo Creed?
3473494 3475995 Shucks, one has been teachin' another.<br />Just keep talkin', Pal.
3476063 3478731 That's all Apollo been doin'.<br />Been runnin' off at the mouth lately.
3478799 3481667 And when I see him, I'm gonna<br />close it for him. All right.
3481734 3484835 When will the match take place?<br />The sooner, the better.
3485070 3487671 I'm the champion of the world.<br />Ain't nothin' can be done about that.
3488039 3490039 I can't be beat,<br />and I won't be beat.
3490106 3492041 This time I'm gonna<br />train even harder.
3492108 3493975 There won't be no quick knockdowns.
3494043 3497010 I'm gonna torture him.<br />I'm gonna crucify him real bad.
3497078 3499912 Hard words from a hard man.
3499980 3505116 The odds against Balboa making a<br />come back at 34 are very long indeed.
3505184 3508485 Can he do it?<br />Most experts doubt it.
3508553 3513855 Balboa was a fine Champion, but his<br />time has passed. I wish him luck.
3513923 3516792 Don't listen to it, Rocky.
3516859 3519594 No, do listen to it, Rock.
3519661 3523396 When this is over, a lot of folks are<br />gonna owe you an engraved apology.
3525699 3529734 And you're gonna owe me a big favor.<br />What favor?
3529802 3532402 When it's over, hmm?
3537007 3541409 Rocko, come on!<br />We're gonna be late at the airport!
3541477 3543944 Let's go. Think we forgot anything?
3544012 3546646 I think we have it all.<br />Maybe another sweater.
3546714 3550048 California's not that cold.<br />It's great, great. A scorcher.
3550116 3552549 Okay, listen. I want you<br />to be a good boy, okay?
3552618 3554885 Okay.<br />And don't give anybody a hard time.
3554953 3557887 Okay.<br />Give me a kiss.
3557955 3560472 Mmm.<br />Yeah.
3565660 3568328 We'll call when we land.<br />Yeah, we'll call.
3572398 3575499 You gonna be a good boy?<br />All right.
3575567 3577334 I'll bring you back something.

3796489 3798490 You don't like 'em?
3799791 3802427 Maybe they don't like you<br />either, Paulie.
3802494 3804494 What'd I do to them?
3805530 3807463 And they call me "Punch."

3839853 3842321 You're wastin' time.<br />He's got heavy feet.
3842389 3845823 Try the balls of your feet.<br />Come on, relax, Rock.
3846092 3848392 Come on.<br />Get those feet out of the concrete.
3848460 3850394 It'll take time, but it'll come.
3850595 3853662 He can't train to the jungle<br />junk music.
3853730 3855663 Well, relax, Rock.
3855731 3858166 Here we go. Come on.<br />Balls of your feet.
3858234 3861135 Let your body find a little.<br />Start a new dance called the frog, huh?
3861203 3861929 Come on, Man.
3861955 3864695 You can't train him<br />like a colored fighter.
3864738 3867306 He ain't got no rhythm.<br />Come on.
3867373 3869507 How do I look?<br />You look great.
3869575 3872609 Everything we do works off<br />the jet. Good.
3873711 3876678 Yeah. Can he swim?
3876746 3878814 With a name like Rock?
3878881 3882749 No time to waste. Let's go. Another lap.<br />Another lap. Move it.
3882817 3886785 Another lap. He ain't no tuna.<br />He belongs back in the gym.
3886853 3890088 He's gotta stretch and use muscles he<br />never thought he had. Come on, Rock!
3890155 3893357 Come on. Stretch now.<br />Move it, Rock! Move it!
3893425 3896052 Nobody can change that much.<br />He's a bruiser.
3896078 3897185 He ain't no boxer.
3897228 3901230 You keep tellin' him that and<br />he'll be nothin', you know? Yeah?
3901297 3904031 Another lap.<br />Come on now. Move it.
3904099 3907900 Move it, Rock. Move it. Come on.<br />Let's go. Let's go.
3907968 3910203 That's it. Stretch it.<br />Stretch it out.
3910271 3913372 That's it. You gotta pull.<br />Hard, now. Hard.
3920378 3923742 Shut up, you sterno bums!
3923768 3924937 I'll squash ya!
3924980 3927081 There's decent people<br />tryin' to sleep!
3927150 3930217 Shut up, you honky scum<br />bastard mother.
3930285 3933620 Who needs this sick place?<br />I don't.
3935839 3937689 No class.
3940592 3943160 Damn, that Clubber's strong.
3943227 3946128 Fifteen rounds is a long time.
3946163 3950498 You gotta put him away early.
3950566 3956202 I figure with the pace we gotta set, Rock<br />can last maybe seven or eight rounds.
3956270 3959238 Then we'll be out of steam, Man.
3959305 3962806 Got to put him away early.
3965343 3968778 At least the water's hot.
3970980 3975049 Well, we never really had a honeymoon.
3975117 3977117 It's not so bad.
3978418 3982187 We've been in worse places.
3982255 3985690 In the corner.<br />Rocky's in trouble in round two.
3985758 3988110 He takes a right. Another right!<br />He's been cut.
3988136 3989017 Rocky's been cut!
3991327 3993328 Come on, Rock.<br />Come on, come on now.
3994596 3997098 Let's go.<br />You gotta get tougher.
3997166 3999833 Think smooth. Think smooth.<br />Bounce, bounce, bounce.
3999901 4002835 Toes, toes. On your toes, Rock.<br />On your toes.
4002903 4005336 On your toes.<br />On your toes!
4005404 4007572 Push yourself, Rock!<br />Concentrate.
4007640 4009674 Let's move it, Rock.<br />Move it now.
4009741 4011775 Come on, Rock.<br />Come on.
4012176 4015110 Have fun with it.<br />That's it.
4015178 4018147 That's it. Easy, easy, easy. Smooth.
4018214 4021547 On the toes. Don't push it.<br />Let it come.
4021615 4023548 There it is.<br />It'll come.
4023616 4025549 Just takes time, Baby.<br />Just takes time.
4025617 4027551 Come on. Move the head.
4027619 4029552 Move your head.<br />Up and down.
4029620 4031855 Come on. Come on.<br />Slip now. Up and down.
4031923 4036091 In and out.<br />Inside. Inside, Baby.
4036159 4038459 Side to side. Move your head.<br />Watch him now.
4038527 4040795 Remember, he's got two hands.
4045399 4047599 Damn, Man!<br />What the hell you doin'?
4047667 4052236 This guy will knock you<br />on your ass!
4052304 4054237 Come on, Rock, it's not a game.
4054305 4058040 You wanna live in the hospital<br />for five weeks this time?
4058108 4060641 You thought I was tough.<br />This chump will kill you!
4060709 4064411 All right. Come on. Get your<br />head on your shoulders, Man.
4064478 4066579 Think about the fight.<br />Think about the fight.
4066647 4069648 Clubber Lang, and he's trying<br />to hurt you, Rock. Okay.
4069716 4072550 Okay, here it comes. Jab.<br />He's jabbin'. He's jabbin'.
4072618 4074274 He's tryin' to hurt you!<br />You gotta fight him.
4074300 4075076 You gotta move!
4077272 4078615 He's taking a beating!
4078641 4079447 He's up against the ropes.
4079489 4082324 He's back into the corner.
4085961 4088528 He's hooked ya!<br />He's hooked ya!
4088595 4091131 Damn, Rock!<br />Come on!
4091199 4094233 What's the matter with you? Tomorrow.
4094301 4097501 Let's do it tomorrow.<br />There is no tomorrow!
4097569 4100237 There is no tomorrow!
4100305 4103439 There is no tomorrow!
4108277 4110623 There's just one thing<br />that you gotta remember.
4110649 4111871 We gotta get some speed.
4111913 4116014 You gotta get some flexibility. You gotta<br />get some quickness. You understand?
4116082 4120918 Yeah. That's the only thing we gotta<br />concern ourselves with, Rocky.
4120986 4122986 Mickey never had me do this.
4124288 4127923 Yeah. Okay.<br />Here we go.
4127991 4129991 Ready?
4133394 4136196 Set. Go!
4136264 4138297 Come on, come on!
4138299 4140698 Speed, speed!<br />Come on. Come on!
4148405 4151506 Come on!
4151574 4155158 You can't win, Rock.
4155160 4159162 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
4159380 4161680 He'll knock you into tomorrow, Rock.
4205546 4207813 What's the matter?
4207881 4212317 It's over.<br />It's all over.
4222425 4224325 What's the matter with you?
4260419 4262419 Can I talk to you?
4266756 4269824 I want to ask you something important,<br />and I want you to tell me the truth.
4271026 4274961 What?<br />Why'd you come here?
4276463 4278697 I just don't want it no more.
4278765 4281967 If it's over because you want<br />it to be over, I'm glad.
4283034 4285735 I do.
4285803 4289805 It's just you've never quit<br />anything since I've known you.
4293641 4295576 I don't know what you want me<br />to say.
4295643 4297910 I mean, what happened?
4297979 4300545 How did everything that was<br />so good get so bad?
4300613 4304148 What's so bad?<br />Tell me. What?
4304483 4307550 I wrecked everything<br />by not thinking for myself.
4307618 4311087 Why couldn't Mickey tell me where<br />I was really at right from the start?
4311154 4313255 He didn't have to carry me and<br />lie to me and make me think...
4313323 4315823 I was better than I really was,<br />when I wasn't.
4315891 4319559 He never lied.<br />Those fights weren't right.
4319627 4321560 I never fought anybody<br />who was all in their prime.
4321628 4326731 There was always some angle to hold onto<br />the title longer than I should've had it.
4326799 4328732 Do you understand what I'm sayin'?<br />I understand.
4328800 4332735 But you've gotta understand that he loved<br />you, and that was his job, protecting you.
4332803 4335904 But protecting don't help nothin'!<br />It only makes things worse.
4335972 4339474 You wake up after a few years thinking<br />you're a winner, but you're not.
4339541 4343910 You're really a loser. And so we wouldn't<br />have had the title as long. So what?
4343978 4345911 It would have been real!
4345979 4346780 It was real!
4346806 4350006 Nothing is real if you don't<br />believe in who you are!
4350049 4353984 I don't believe in myself no more. And<br />when a fighter don't believe, that's it!
4354052 4356452 He's finished!<br />It's over. That's it.
4356520 4359088 That's not it! Tell me the truth!<br />That is it!
4359156 4362457 What are you putting me through, Adrian?<br />You wanna know the truth?
4362525 4364658 I don't wanna lose what I got.
4364726 4366631 In the beginning I didn't<br />care what happened to me.
4366657 4368086 I'd go in the ring,<br />I'd get busted up.
4368129 4370829 I didn't care! But now there's you.<br />There's the kid.
4370897 4375099 I don't wanna lose what I got! What do<br />we have that can't be replaced? What?
4375167 4378201 A house. We got cars.<br />We got money.
4378269 4381937 We got everything but the truth.<br />What's the truth, damn it?
4382005 4384472 I'm afraid! All right?
4384540 4386792 You wanna hear me say it?<br />You wanna break me down?
4386818 4387832 All right, I'm afraid.
4387875 4389809 For the first time in my life,<br />I'm afraid.
4389877 4392978 I'm afraid too. There's nothin'<br />wrong with being afraid.
4393047 4396014 For me there is. Why?<br />You're human, aren't ya?
4396081 4398015 I don't know what I am.
4398083 4400651 All I know is I'm a liar, and because<br />of that, Mickey ain't here no more.
4401002 4405354 You didn't push him into anything! He was<br />a grown man and he did what he had to do.
4405422 4408190 And you have no right to feel guilty<br />for what happened. You don't!
4408258 4411659 You were a Champion, and you did<br />what you were expected to do.
4411726 4414494 And you did what I and everybody<br />else thought you should do.
4414562 4416830 And you wanna tell me that<br />those fights weren't real?
4416856 4417821 That you were carried?
4417864 4420498 Well, I don't believe it! But it<br />doesn't matter what I believe,
4420566 4424701 because you're the one that's gotta<br />carry that fear around inside you,
4424769 4426936 afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
4427003 4431239 Afraid you're gonna be remembered as a<br />coward, that you're not a man anymore.
4431307 4434808 Well, none of it's true. But it<br />doesn't matter if I tell you.
4434876 4439079 Because you're the one that's<br />gotta settle it. Get rid of it.
4439146 4443114 Because when all the smoke has cleared and<br />everyone's through chanting your name,
4443182 4445116 it's just gonna be us.
4445184 4448218 And you can't live like this.<br />We can't live like this.
4448286 4450252 'Cause it's gonna bother you<br />for the rest of your life.
4450320 4452821 Look what it's doing to you now.
4459094 4463129 Apollo thinks you can do it.<br />So do I.
4463197 4465697 But you gotta wanna do it<br />for the right reasons.
4465764 4470267 Not for the guilt over Mickey.<br />Not for the people, not for the title.
4470335 4473769 Not for money or me.<br />But for you.
4473837 4476771 Just you. Just you alone.
4479975 4483376 And if I lose?<br />Then you lose!
4483444 4488480 But at least you lose<br />with no excuses. No fear.
4488547 4491116 And I know you can live with that.
4498921 4501556 How'd you get so tough?
4501624 4505292 I live with a fighter.
4511530 4513530 I really love you.

4734188 4736221 Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.
4736289 4739990 I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin, and<br />we welcome you to Madison Square Garden,
4740325 4741926 Rocky!
4742277 4743810 A most exciting backdrop<br />for the rematch
4743836 4745519 between the Former Champion,<br />Rocky Balboa...
4745562 4748096 And the reigning Heavyweight<br />Champion, Clubber Lang.
4748164 4752300 We now switch to our remote cameras<br />inside the dressing rooms.
4752367 4756401 Would you care to comment on how you plan<br />to fight Balboa? What's your strategy?
4756469 4759304 Don't need any.<br />Balboa's so predictable and stupid.
4759330 4760964 The man comes straight ahead.
4761006 4763673 He's tailor made for me,<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
4763741 4766643 That's good.<br />Bend 'em over, huh?
4766711 4770946 That's good.<br />How does that look? Okay?
4771013 4773881 No, I don't hate Balboa.<br />But I pity the fool,
4773949 4777883 and I will destroy any man who<br />tries to take what I got.
4780854 4784255 Remember where you came from.
4784323 4787707 Remember what it took<br />to get you here.
4787775 4790443 And you remember what he did<br />to you last time. Right?
4790511 4793044 Since both men are brawlers, Stu,
4793313 4794932 with the edge and power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
4794958 4796439 I would say that the<br />odds are very long...
4796481 4798982 Against Balboa regaining his title.
4799049 4803151 Now it's your turn.<br />It's your turn, huh?
4804253 4806487 What's your prediction<br />for the fight, then?
4806555 4809756 Prediction?<br />Yes. Prediction.
4810758 4812692 Pain.
4812759 4815827 Lang is a brawler who likes<br />to hurt a man to the body.
4815894 4820130 And Balboa may never have psychologically<br />recovered from that vicious knockout...
4820198 4822199 That Clubber laid on him.
4824000 4826000 It's time.
4827203 4829603 Here.<br />What?
4832073 4834073 I want you to wear these.
4836377 4838844 Come on, Apollo.<br />These are, uh,
4838911 4842012 the colors that you wore<br />in our first fight together.
4842080 4846182 I can't wear your colors.<br />Just wear 'em.
4846250 4849618 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
4849686 4854421 Thanks, Apollo. You just make sure you<br />wash 'em before you bring 'em back.
4854489 4856590 Will do. Will do.
4856658 4859024 And thanks, Apollo.
4859092 4862360 And remember,<br />after this you owe me a favor.
4862428 4864628 What favor?
4864863 4869432 Bill, I have to agree. Toe to toe, Lang<br />is devastating, and he's much too strong.
4869500 4873235 All right. Listen.
4873302 4874635 I just want to tell you<br />that I'm proud of you.
4874661 4875595 Takes a hell of a man to change,
4875637 4877572 and you're gonna prove it<br />to 'em tonight, right?
4877639 4879906 Right. You did good, Apollo.
4879974 4882107 Thanks, Paulie. Okay.<br />Let's do it, Paulie.
4884428 4888279 Here comes Rocky and Apollo,<br />the two Former Champions.
4888381 4891014 Look at that United<br />States Marine Corps Color Guard,
4891082 4892948 along with the Drum and Bugle Corps.
4893016 4894617 Magnificent.<br />Tremendous.
4894885 4898019 Take a look at Rocky. Look at the<br />tenseness, the tautness of that body.
4898087 4900187 Boy, does he look serious.
4900255 4904373 He certainly does. The word is<br />that this is Rocky's last fight.
4904392 4907293 Win, lose or draw.<br />There he is, the Italian Stallion.
4907728 4910661 Rocky Balboa,<br />climbing into the ring.
4910729 4913147 Boy, he looks incredibly thin,<br />doesn't he?
4913214 4915399 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
4915467 4918351 Rocky Balboa,<br />the Iron Man from Philadelphia!
4918369 4922970 This crowd is certainly<br />with him tonight. Listen.
4923038 4925539 Balboa doesn't really have<br />any boxing skill.
4925607 4928374 I've never seen a fighter though<br />with as much raw determination.
4928441 4931777 Oh, hold it, Stu. Look behind me.<br />Here comes the Champion now.
4931844 4934211 Clubber Lang.<br />Listen to this crowd.
4935580 4937780 Take a look at those eyes.
4937782 4941666 I've never seen a guy with<br />such sullen eyes. He is tough.
4941734 4946521 Clubber, go back where you<br />came from!
4946922 4950156 He even belted a spectator<br />on the way in. Did you see that?
4950425 4952641 Look at that man.<br />Awesome, awesome.
4952709 4954992 He's tough. Look at that.<br />Clubber Lang,
4955060 4957261 the Heavyweight Champion<br />of the World.
4957329 4959663 Keep it loose.. Hey, Fool!
4959731 4963399 You ready for another beatin'?<br />You should've never came back.
4963466 4965867 Don't look at him.<br />Let's just be cool.
4965935 4969970 Hey, Boy!<br />Hey, Boy!
4970038 4972171 After I crucify him, you're next.
4972239 4975707 Just stay out of my face, Chump.<br />Don't turn your back on me, Sucker!
4975942 4978811 We got a brawl! Apollo and<br />Clubber wanna go at each other.
4978878 4981713 This ring is ready to explode!
4981781 4985014 The fight is about to officially begin,<br />but these guys wanna start right now!
4985082 4988584 Let me go! Let me go!<br />I'm gonna get you!
4988652 4991903 Come on!<br />Let him go! I want him!
4991971 4994588 I thought you said be cool!<br />That was cool.
4994656 4997690 I'm the Champ!<br />I'll beat ya like I did last time!
4997958 4999706 You don't have to look to find me.<br />I'm here.
4999732 5000817 Good evening...
5000860 5004094 Ladies and Gentlemen and boxing fans<br />around the world. Take this robe off!
5004162 5006864 Welcome to Madison Square Garden...
5006964 5010933 And tonight's Heavyweight<br />Championship of the World!
5011000 5014101 This crowd is ready tonight.<br />The red corner:
5014169 5017104 Rocky! Rocky!<br />The challenger,
5017172 5020856 weighing 191 pounds.
5020924 5023976 From the fighting city of Philadelphia,
5024043 5027545 the Former Heavyweight Champion<br />of the World,
5027613 5030113 the Italian Stallion,
5030181 5034383 Rocky Balboa!
5040121 5042555 I'll tell you,<br />he has so slimmed down.
5042623 5044090 He looks like a middleweight.
5044157 5046558 Out of the blue corner,
5046626 5049927 weighing 237 pounds,
5049995 5053563 the hard punching battler<br />from Chicago,
5053631 5057900 the reigning Heavyweight<br />Champion of the World,
5058001 5061002 Clubber Lang!
5061070 5064371 Referee Lou Fillipo.
5064438 5067907 Okay, Boys.<br />Let's go.
5067975 5071342 We went over the rules yesterday.<br />I'm just gonna repeat a few of 'em.
5071410 5074044 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
5074112 5076779 In case of knockdown, you go<br />to the corner I tell you to,
5077014 5079616 and you stay there<br />until I tell you to come out.
5079683 5082818 Is that understood?<br />Any questions?
5082886 5084919 Okay. Let's go back<br />to your corner now.
5084987 5088187 I'm gonna bust you up.
5088255 5090256 Go for it.
5091925 5094826 Well, here we go. The war is on.
5094894 5096911 We're just waiting for the bell.
5096979 5098896 Take my belt off.<br />I'm gonna get that chump.
5098963 5102632 Don't let this bum let you fight his fight.<br />You're the best!
5103000 5105333 You're the Champ.<br />(Mutters)
5105401 5109102 Rhythm and power. Rhythm and power.<br />Then jab him. Thanks.
5109170 5111704 Rocky! Rocky!
5114174 5117742 Are you ready for round one now?<br />Should be a great fight.
5117810 5119743 And here we go.<br />Rocky Balboa.
5119811 5123012 And he goes right out of his corner.<br />He goes right after Clubber Lang!
5123180 5125119 He's running right to left,<br />into Clubber's place.
5125145 5126306 What a start of a fight here!
5126348 5131518 Another jab. Another jab.<br />And another!
5131586 5133519 Oh! This is not the Rocky we expected.
5133587 5135937 Looks fantastic.<br />He's dancing like Apollo Creed!
5139025 5141793 Another right.<br />Stay in there!
5141860 5143794 Look at that right and left<br />to the head!
5143861 5146395 Clubber Lang doesn't know<br />what's happening right now.
5146462 5148430 He's being stunned by this style.
5148498 5151566 Look at the shots he's taking.
5153201 5155769 But he can't corner<br />the fleet footed challenger.
5155837 5158470 It's absolutely unbelievable.
5158538 5159839 Absolutely!
5159907 5162757 Come on, you over sized hick.<br />Come on! Hit me!
5162824 5165826 That right hand is<br />just like a trip hammer.
5169213 5171546 Rock, tie him up!<br />Bring it to me. Hit me!
5171614 5173782 Break it up.<br />Step back. Step back.
5173850 5177418 Tough first round.<br />Tough first round!
5177484 5180486 And it is Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts right to the head of Lang.
5180554 5183522 Get off! Get off!<br />Now it's Lang coming back.
5183590 5186524 This crowd is going absolutely wild.
5191362 5194963 There's some left right<br />combinations by Rocky.
5195031 5196847 A good left hand!
5200235 5202035 This is Rocky Balboa's night!
5209942 5212342 It's a full time operation<br />getting him back to his corner.
5212409 5215311 We've got pandemonium in the<br />ring at the end of round one.
5215379 5219247 They're holding him back.<br />Lang wants more.
5219249 5221750 I'll get you, fool! He can't<br />realize that the round is over.
5223751 5225485 All right. All right.<br />You looked great.
5225553 5229188 Just don't get crazy and we're home.<br />I'll kill you, Man!
5229256 5230822 The man's strong.
5230890 5234258 I'm gonna kill him.<br />I'm gonna kill him!
5236027 5237994 Now, he's gonna come hard.<br />Right? Yeah.
5238062 5239929 You keep crowding him.<br />Don't give him a chance to set.
5239997 5244732 Counter and move.<br />He had Lang at his mercy.
5244799 5248468 I don't think Lang knew what<br />hit him there this first round.
5248770 5251036 Here we go now.<br />The bell for round two.
5251104 5253805 Now it's Lang coming out<br />stronger in round two.
5255775 5257707 But it's Rocky now in his corner.
5257776 5259805 Rocky is still landing<br />rights and lefts. He's
5259831 5261769 using rights now in the<br />center of the ring.
5261812 5263880 A right to the head.<br />Another right to the head.
5263947 5266248 He's really setting him up.<br />Right. Right. Right.
5266315 5268849 Five unanswered shots!
5268917 5271751 Kill him! Kill him!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
5275288 5277256 Get outta there!<br />Get back there!
5282459 5285128 All right! All right!
5285196 5289363 Get off. Break it up!<br />Break it up.
5289431 5292616 What are you doing?<br />Come on! Come on, Balboa!
5292801 5295560 Come on!<br />I'm gonna give it to you!
5295586 5296994 Get your hands up!
5298222 5299871 Ooh!<br />That right hand hurt Rocky again.
5299939 5301739 What a fight!
5301807 5306143 He's got him in the corner.<br />Balboa's got trouble now.
5309979 5313714 Hold him, damn it.<br />Hold him!
5313782 5317150 Come on, Rocky! Come on!<br />This is Clubber's round so far.
5317218 5320719 Lang is taking momentum here.<br />He's holding on Balboa!
5324056 5327291 And Balboa is down!<br />Can he make it up?
5327358 5329893 Get up, damn it!<br />Come on!
5329961 5333796 Five, six... Can he get up?<br />He's in trouble.
5333863 5337199 But he's up.<br />Seven..
5337333 5339766 Rocky's gonna..<br />Here comes Clubber again!
5339834 5342501 Lang with the left hand. Lang with<br />another left hand. Now a right!
5342837 5345770 Another right. A right!<br />Another right!
5345838 5348739 Down goes Balboa again!
5348807 5350407 Stop the fight!
5350475 5352242 Six!
5352310 5356628 I got some more for you! Get up!<br />I got a lotta moves.
5356696 5359196 Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
5359348 5361349 Come on!<br />Come on, Fool.
5363852 5367453 Ain't so bad. Ya ain't so bad.<br />Ain't so bad!
5367520 5370788 You ain't so bad.
5370857 5372422 You must be crazy!
5372490 5375525 You're just a stupid fool! I may be<br />stupid, but I ain't breathing heavy.
5375860 5377793 He's a fool!
5377861 5380229 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
5380363 5382647 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?
5382714 5384679 It's strategy, that's all.<br />I know what I'm doin'.
5384705 5385491 No. You don't know.
5385533 5390302 He's gotta come to you. You the Champ.<br />He's nothin'. He's mine!
5390370 5392471 You stand toe to toe,<br />and he'll kill you.
5392822 5394805 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />there and get your head beat off!
5394873 5396806 Don't..<br />He's gettin' tired.
5396874 5400376 Don't go wastin' your punches.<br />You're the Champ!
5400443 5403045 Don't try to take him out<br />with one punch. Use your head.
5403380 5405480 Now, you wear him down.<br />He's all ours! Yeah.
5405547 5407647 I know what I'm doin'.<br />I swear I know what I'm doin'.
5407715 5411550 Don't tell me what you think! Go out<br />there and do it, Rock. Eye of the tiger.
5411886 5413552 You understand?<br />Yeah.
5413620 5417089 Go out there and knock his head off.<br />He's just a man, Rock.
5417390 5420724 Be more man than him! Go get him!<br />Eye of the tiger!
5420893 5424560 Eye of the tiger! Up and down.<br />Side to side.
5424627 5427696 Round three.<br />Tough rounds to call right now.
5427764 5429530 This is a little slower<br />than the start.
5429598 5432332 It's my round.
5432400 5434734 So I'm gonna take you this time.
5434802 5436802 You're mine.
5436870 5440105 Come on. Gonna get ya. Come on.
5441807 5445042 And Rocky throws him<br />three rights to the head.
5445109 5448544 Then a left. He is back.<br />These are heavyweights.
5452214 5455449 Get out! Get out!<br />Take that!
5455517 5457851 A sharp left!
5459186 5461520 Get outta there!
5462756 5465022 Stick him! Stick him!
5467341 5470292 Come on, come on.<br />Come on, Clubber.
5470360 5472495 Again, again!
5472562 5476464 He's gettin' killed. Oh, no, no.<br />He's not gettin' killed. He's gettin' mad.
5476532 5479366 Come on. Whole world's watching.<br />Knock me out.
5480534 5483636 Come on, harder!<br />Can't you hit hard?
5486989 5489407 No!
5490341 5492609 Get outta there!
5494577 5497178 Rocky!
5498897 5501648 Come on!<br />Get into him, Rock!
5501716 5504117 Yeah!
5504184 5506385 My mother hits harder than that.<br />Come on. A little harder.
5506452 5508920 A little harder, Champ!<br />In the face. Come on.
5510122 5512689 Again. Come on, Champ.<br />You ain't so bad.
5512724 5515825 You ain't nothin'.<br />You ain't nothin'!
5517428 5520629 Rocky! Rocky!
5533772 5536640 I see it now.<br />I might believe the strategy now.
5536707 5539008 He's making Clubber Lang miss now.
5539076 5542478 You see how he drew him in?<br />Now Rocky's throwing punches.
5542546 5545513 But look at the punches<br />that Lang is taking!
5545581 5547823 Look at that.<br />He's lifting him right off the
5547849 5550240 canvas with those forceful<br />punches to the ribs!
5553219 5555587 Where does he get that strength from?<br />He's coming.
5555955 5558455 He's completely psyched out<br />this time!
5558523 5562058 Lang is confused by all of this.
5562125 5566161 Obviously the condition that<br />Balboa is in right now, Bill.
5566228 5568262 Look at the condition.
5573100 5576569 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
5576636 5579471 All to the body! Harder punches!<br />Come on!
5588878 5590579 Come on! Come on.
5590646 5594849 Come on. Come on.
5594916 5597249 Come on. Come on.
5607625 5610392 This place has gone bananas!
5610460 5611794 Get up!
5611862 5614629 Five, six,
5614697 5617898 seven, eight,
5617966 5620265 nine, ten.
5620333 5622735 You're out!
5625004 5627821 Yea!<br />He's on the floor in ecstasy!
5627889 5630607 Bowing, praying there,<br />beating the floor!
5630674 5633942 And there he is, the New Heavyweight<br />Champion of the World!
5634010 5636444 Rocky Balboa!
5639147 5643099 Rocky is exhausted!
5643166 5645885 We did it!
5645952 5649487 Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />the winner by knockout.
5649522 5651889 Are you all right?
5651956 5655825 Never better.<br />Never better.
5655893 5658593 The Heavyweight Champion of<br />the World,
5658661 5660428 the Italian Stallion,
5660496 5664697 Rocky Balboa!
5672137 5674704 Come on. We made a deal!
5674772 5678740 I know, but this is extremely crazy.<br />Yeah. Mentally irregular.
5678808 5680742 Yeah. But it makes all<br />the sense in the world.
5680810 5684812 You owe me a favor. I know, but,<br />uh, when'd you think of this?
5684879 5688614 About three years ago.<br />Oh, this is very crazy, Apollo.
5688682 5692750 Look, Stallion. When you won that<br />last fight, you won by one second.
5692818 5696686 You beat me by one second. That's very hard<br />for a man of my intelligence to handle.
5696754 5700089 Is it? Didn't you say after I beat you,<br />you learned how to live with it?
5700157 5703291 I lied. Oh, you lied.
5703359 5705994 So now you just gotta prove<br />it to yourself, right?
5706062 5709096 Just myself. No TV, no newspapers.<br />Just you and me.
5709164 5712098 Nothin'. Just you and me.<br />Age before beauty.
5712166 5715367 Anything you say, Stallion. All right.<br />I'll do all the work. All right?
5715435 5717368 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow,
5717436 5719736 'cause you ain't as young<br />as springtime no more.
5719804 5722238 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, Stallion.
5722306 5725841 Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?<br />You taught me everything you know.
5725976 5728776 Almost everything.<br />You gotta remember now.
5728844 5732379 You fight great, but I'm a great fighter.<br />You ready?
5732447 5736582 Absolutely.<br />You know, Stallion,
5736649 5740418 it's too bad we gotta get old, right?
5740486 5744321 Aw, just keep punchin', Apollo.
5744389 5746322 Wanna ring the bell?
5746390 5751126 All right.<br />Ding, ding.
5751194 5754061 Come on, Stallion.
5754129 5756062 Come on. Come on.
5756130 5760165 Boy, you really move good<br />for an older guy.
5760233 5763468 You're lookin' good, Stallion.<br />I taught you well.
5763535 5767269 I think you taught me too good.<br />You can fly.
5767337 5772140 Look out now. You don't<br />want any of this. Come on.
5772208 5774241 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
5774309 5776242 Come on. Watch yourself.<br />Are you ready?
