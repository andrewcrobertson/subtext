427630 430920 REPORTER: Well, another southpaw,<br />heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa,
431010 433140 doesn't seem to be worried<br />about much these days.
433220 435430 He's just defended his<br />title for the 10th time,
435510 437060 and now he's even<br />agreed to take on
437140 438930 the world heavyweight<br />wrestling champion
439020 441480 in a sort of charity benefit,<br />with all the proceeds
441560 443270 to go to a local<br />youth foundation.
443350 445230 Now, I'll have to<br />give him credit.
445310 447270 Mr. Balboa manages<br />to stay busy.
447360 448610 He's a true sportsman.
448690 451190 And it looks like the number<br />one contender, Clubber Lang,
451280 453280 will have to continue to<br />play the waiting game.
453360 455910 But that should be<br />a great, great matchup.
455990 458370 MAN 1: Hey, Paulie,<br />take it easy, okay?
458740 461410 MAN ON TV: Awesome.<br />Introducing the newest...
461500 463460 MAN 2: Hey, you going?
463540 466750 Hey, hey. Don't forget to<br />give Rocky my best, huh?
467210 469840 You know, I've been<br />coming here years.
470380 474430 How about you giving me,<br />Paulie, your best once?
475220 476970 MAN 2: Take it easy, Paul.
478100 479640 MAN 3: Hey, hey, Paulie.
479720 481520 Hey, Paulie,<br />you heard me?
481600 485440 Hey, when you see the Rock, tell<br />him the boys all said, "Hey!"
526440 527980 WOMAN: 40 thousand.
532530 534280 MAN: Nice try.<br />Nice try.
535400 537070 WOMAN: I got another one.
592670 593840 ROCKY: Paulie.
598800 600390 You want to hear<br />I owe you?
600470 601760 You, I owe nothing.
601850 604140 No, you don't<br />owe me nothing.
604220 606350 So what do you<br />want I should do?
606430 607680 My sister ain't here?
607770 608890 She's home.
608980 612690 You know, me and her used to<br />be tight until you come in.
612770 615320 I raise her,<br />she don't come down.
615400 617740 She don't know<br />about this.
617820 619740 You and her can go to<br />hell, you know that?
619820 622280 Hey, watch your<br />mouth, Paulie.
622370 624620 You gonna whack me?<br />I don't sweat you.
624700 626190 I don't sweat you.<br />Come on.
626270 628640 Oh, come on, Paul, why don't<br />you screw your head on right.
628720 630250 No, it ain't my head.
630330 632580 Your freaking head is<br />the one on wrong.
632670 635130 Yeah? Well,<br />what did I do?
635210 636920 What'd you do?<br />Nothing.
637010 638630 For yourself,<br />oh, nice.
638720 640800 Look, you fixed<br />your face up handsome.
640890 641970 Nice clothes.
642050 643890 What did you do for<br />Paulie? Anything?
643970 645970 Three years, did<br />you get me a job?
646060 650560 Look at this. You gave me a lousy,<br />stinking Ex-Lax watch. This!
651440 652480 Hey, Paulie.
652560 653610 What?
653690 655570 What? There,<br />that's right.
655650 657320 No, leave it down!
657400 659690 It never kept<br />good time anyway.
660610 662260 You know, you forget<br />when you were a punk
662340 664820 and those guys used to laugh at<br />you because you were so jive.
664910 666830 Who used to whack<br />them bums out?
666910 668700 They laughed<br />at both of us.
668790 670410 No one laughed at me.
671420 673420 Tell me. Who fixed you up<br />with your first woman?
673500 675420 Me, Paulie!<br />I was responsible!
675500 677340 She was pregnant.
677420 680420 So what? You was<br />no prize either.
681090 683510 You know, I always<br />give you. I give you.
683590 687470 What do you do? You buy a new<br />house, you move Mick in, right?
687560 690980 Did you ask me? Is there<br />something the matter with me?
691940 693870 I got feelings, you know?<br />This ain't cardboard.
695110 697270 Everybody's got<br />them, Paulie.
697650 699280 The hell with everybody.
699360 701280 No, maybe it's<br />the hell with you.
702110 703680 I don't wanna listen<br />to this crap.
703680 705730 Come on, you talk like<br />everybody owes you a living.
705740 706740 Shut your mouth!
706780 709950 Look, nobody owes nobody nothing.<br />You owe yourself.
710040 711410 You're wrong!<br />Friends owe!
711500 713040 Friends don't owe.
713120 714920 They do because<br />they want to do.
715000 717630 Shut your freaking mouth.<br />You been keeping me down!
717710 718800 Down?
719960 722970 You know, you're like a crazy brother to me.<br />You really are.
723060 724930 So I want to tell you something.<br />This is coming
724930 726240 straight from<br />the heart, Paulie.
726300 727890 And I mean this.
727970 731140 You ain't down,<br />and you ain't a loser.
731890 735560 You're just<br />a jealous, lazy bum.
736730 739230 Okay, I'm gonna<br />break your mouth.
739650 741860 I'm gonna bust<br />your mouth up!
753040 754660 Can I have a job?
758000 760040 All you had<br />to do was ask.
765470 767260 You punch pretty good.
767340 769220 Think so?<br />Superb.
772020 773350 It cost a lot, huh?
773430 774730 Yeah, a few bucks.
775190 776810 Got an extra one?
780070 781690 ADRIAN: Any trouble<br />with Paulie tonight?
781780 783530 ROCKY: Nah,<br />nothing unusual.
784200 786700 Are you really gonna fight that wrestler?<br />They're so big.
786780 789070 That's all right,<br />it'll be fun.
789870 792370 You mind if I<br />serenade you a while?
794210 796120 Come on, it's your part.<br />What are you doing?
796210 797330 Come on.<br />You can do it.
797420 798500 No.
799680 801380 Come on, Rocky, you're<br />gonna wake the baby.
801460 803840 Adrian, come on,<br />let's do a duet.
807550 810550 No, no. That's good,<br />but it's not "doe, doe."
810640 813390 It's "doo, doo,<br />doo, doo."
815850 817060 That's good, darling.
817140 819400 l've been told
822190 825190 By people and they all
827070 828950 Say they'd take me back
829030 831570 Take me back like before
835370 836830 What's the matter?
836910 839080 I don't know any more<br />of that composition.
839170 840500 Hmm.
840580 841670 Maybe we're lucky.
841750 843290 Yeah. Maybe<br />we're very lucky.
843380 844750 Very lucky.<br />Hmm.
851760 853760 DENNIS: Well, howdy,<br />howdy, howdy, sports fans.
853850 856850 This is Dennis James with Jim<br />Healy down here at ringside.
856930 859190 Tonight we have a most<br />unlikely match for you.
859270 861230 The boxer against<br />the wrestler,
861310 863650 with all the proceeds<br />going to charity.
863730 865070 What's your feelings<br />about a boxer
865070 866520 against a wrestler<br />in the same ring?
866620 869730 Well, you know what the age-old<br />theory is, that the wrestler,
869780 871910 once he grabs that boxer,<br />that's all she wrote.
871990 874450 What the hell goes<br />on inside your head?
874540 875950 Anything normal<br />functions?
876120 877540 Yeah, there's a few,<br />there's a few.
877620 880210 I don't think so. Because to<br />fight a creature like this,
880290 882920 you gotta have about 100<br />pounds of brain damage.
883000 885840 I seen wrestlers that was<br />bigger than dinosaurs.
885960 888380 You ever fight a dinosaur, kid?<br />No, not lately.
888470 890840 They can cause<br />a variety of damage.
890930 892050 Oh, yeah?
892140 894890 The wrestling champion of the<br />world is now entering the arena.
894970 896720 I tell you, he is quite a sight.
896810 898730 All decked out in red.
898810 900350 Why are they<br />carrying him?
900440 901810 He's walking.
908110 910490 I'm coming after<br />you, Balboa.
911200 912410 Let's call it off.
912490 913910 Oh, come on,<br />it's for charity.
913990 916080 You're wearing your<br />anatomy out for charity.
916160 918750 Nobody else does<br />this much for charity.
918830 920460 Bob Hope would.
920540 921870 That's true.
927210 929590 Rocky, you better<br />call Bob Hope.
937310 939720 To all my love<br />slaves out there,
940640 944900 Thunderlips is here<br />in the flesh, baby!
944980 946360 Oh, my God!
946860 951860 The ultimate male versus<br />the ultimate meatball.
953660 955450 JIM: Boy, he is a monster.
955530 958280 How much would you take even<br />to get in the ring with him?
958370 960330 Would you like to<br />start at Fort Knox?
960410 963750 In the white corner,<br />an incredible sight.
965040 967210 Standing nearly seven feet,
968420 971170 weighing 390 pounds.
972680 974280 Large, ain't he?<br />The undisputed
974370 975740 wrestling champion<br />of the world...
975820 979140 That's the biggest<br />arm in the world!
979220 983770 A man who calls himself "the<br />ultimate object of desire,"
984850 987440 "the mountain<br />of molten lust."
987520 991070 The one, the only<br />Thunderlips!
994490 1001040 You're all trash!<br />You're all trash!
1004330 1006460 The slugger from<br />Philadelphia...
1007750 1010750 You'd better shut up!
1011920 1013920 I'll break him in half.
1014430 1015840 How much do you<br />think he eats?
1015930 1018180 About 202 pounds.
1018260 1020970 ...weighing 202 pounds,
1021060 1024140 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
1024230 1026640 Rocky Balboa.
1027150 1031070 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1033490 1035280 Come to the center<br />of the ring, please.
1035360 1037160 Okay, come on, Mick.
1045120 1047080 All right, you guys,<br />you know this is for fun,
1047170 1049960 so take it easy and<br />give them a good show.
1051420 1055590 Listen, after the match, how about<br />we get a Polaroid together, okay?
1057050 1058760 You're in trouble!
1059470 1061930 He got me mad. I'm gonna<br />break him in half like this.
1062010 1063810 WOMAN: Come on, Rocky,<br />you can take him.
1063890 1066310 Seems like lately, everybody<br />wants to beat me up.
1066390 1068730 MICKEY: This is entertainment.<br />It's fun and games.
1068810 1071480 Stay away, make faces,<br />move around the ring.
1071610 1073520 Got it, kid? All right.<br />PAULIE: He is the ring.
1076240 1078740 MICKEY: I get nervous<br />every time he does that.
1083740 1086990 Whoa. You move pretty fast for<br />a big guy, you know that?
1087070 1089080 Listen, why don't we just<br />move around a little bit?
1089080 1090660 You know, like,<br />give them a good show.
1090660 1092750 First I'll chase you<br />and you chase me, okay?
1092800 1094500 How's that? All right?<br />I'll go easy.
1094590 1096210 Here you go.<br />That okay?
1096220 1097820 MICKEY: Stay away from him!<br />Does that hurt?
1097820 1098370 You all right?
1098370 1099590 Don't miss.
1099680 1101890 How's that, okay?<br />Not bad, huh?
1104480 1106100 THUNDERLIPS: Come on,<br />meatball. Come on.
1107270 1108310 Hey.
1111270 1113820 Think it's all fake,<br />meatball? All fake!
1113900 1116610 Thunderlips has gone<br />absolutely berserk.
1118530 1120360 Run for your life!
1120450 1122030 Blast off, meatball.
1129750 1133460 Get up, boy! Come on, meatball,<br />get some of this right here!
1139090 1141510 Rocko, remember<br />the neighborhood!
1142680 1144180 Get out of his way!
1144260 1146720 No, no, no! Not yet,<br />not for the meatball.
1146810 1148060 I'm not done<br />with him yet, boy.
1148140 1152100 If I can't break your spirit, I<br />sure enough can break your back.
1155190 1156940 Is Daddy having fun?
1157030 1158400 Of course.
1163870 1165990 Somebody hand me<br />a hatchet.
1167080 1168490 Holy smoke!
1168910 1172080 THUNDERLIPS: Here we go,<br />baby! Lights out, meatball!
1176420 1179510 Oh, my God! Balboa<br />is really in pain.
1179590 1182300 No one can believe the superhuman<br />strength of Thunderlips.
1184050 1185430 I am the man.
1185510 1186760 Stop him, will you?
1186850 1188470 THUNDERLIPS: You want<br />this punching bag?
1188560 1189600 Adrian!
1189680 1191640 Rocky!<br />Then you got him!
1191730 1193190 ROCKY: Catch me!
1193270 1198690 DEN N IS: That's incredible! Balboa was<br />just heaved clear into the fifth row!
1198780 1201110 Now the fans<br />are outraged, too.
1202490 1206200 Now you got me mad! I'm gonna drag<br />him down the aisle like a dirty rag!
1206280 1208160 You weakling, Balboa.
1209450 1211540 Take it easy.<br />Take it easy!
1212500 1214170 PAULIE: What is it,<br />Mickey? You okay?
1214250 1215110 It's my heart.
1215190 1217440 DENNIS: The security guards<br />are rushing out to stop this.
1217520 1220440 People are flying everywhere!<br />Teeth are flying!
1220460 1221710 Cut my gloves off.
1221800 1223800 PAULIE: What,<br />you finished?
1223880 1225970 Come on, cut<br />my gloves off!
1227260 1230720 That place is a zoo! This<br />place has turned into a zoo!
1230810 1232100 This is very, very...
1232180 1234560 Want me to get<br />a doctor? You sure?
1234650 1236270 JIM: The girls have<br />gotten into it now.
1236360 1238150 They're getting<br />beat up, too.
1240820 1242940 Where are you going, you fool?<br />I'll be right back.
1243030 1245280 You're a maniac!<br />Come back here!
1245360 1247070 What are you doing?
1247160 1248450 Come back here!
1248530 1250370 Come on! You!
1250450 1253250 Get out of my way,<br />worms! I'm coming up!
1255960 1257580 Come on! Come on!
1262550 1264970 REFEREE: All right, Thunderlips,<br />break it up! Break it up!
1265050 1267180 No choking!<br />No choking!
1270010 1271560 ROCKY: Paulie, don't!
1274480 1276350 No, I don't<br />sweat you.
1285070 1286820 Hang on there, kid!
1288450 1290160 ROCKY: How do you<br />like it, huh?
1290240 1292030 You're kind of cute!
1292450 1293450 I don't need this.
1293540 1296040 JIM: Rocky is out-and-out<br />strangling him.
1296160 1298620 Rocky hanging on<br />like a bull terrier.
1298710 1301710 Now he's got him<br />in a stranglehold.
1301800 1304090 ALL: Rocky! Rocky!
1309970 1311390 The body!
1316390 1318230 Knock his block off!
1326240 1327990 ROCKY: Timber!
1330700 1334160 DEN N IS: It's unbelievable!<br />Rocky actually did it!
1334240 1336620 The human skyscraper has<br />been thrown out of the ring!
1337870 1340790 REFEREE: All right, that's it, that's it.<br />Time is up.
1343750 1347920 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have a draw. A draw.
1349720 1352850 Thank you all for attending<br />this 12th annual charity match
1352930 1355470 between the Italian<br />Stallion, Rocky Balboa,
1355560 1358020 and Thunderlips,<br />the Ultimate Male.
1358100 1360390 See you next year.<br />Thank God.
1360480 1362770 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, pretty good.
1363150 1364650 Good match.
1364730 1366860 Hey, why'd you get so<br />crazy on me out there?
1366940 1368890 That's the name<br />of the game.
1368970 1370490 Well, listen, while<br />you're still calm,
1370570 1372490 can we get that<br />Polaroid together?
1372570 1373870 Yeah, sure.
1373950 1375700 Adrian, come<br />on over here.
1375790 1378040 My wife, Adrian.<br />My kid.
1378120 1380000 That's Thunderlips.<br />Would you do that?
1380080 1382630 ROCKY J R.: That hurt.<br />Okay, that's all right.
1382750 1385590 You know, sometimes<br />charity really hurts.
1390010 1392300 ROCKY: And this Pinocchio,<br />he told a lie, you see,
1392430 1393970 and his nose started<br />growing real big.
1394050 1396600 ROCKY J R.: Why didn't<br />his ears grow?
1396680 1398970 I don't know. I didn't<br />write the story there.
1399060 1400480 Are you fighting again?
1400560 1403230 Today? No, I don't<br />plan on fighting today.
1403310 1404310 Promise?
1404400 1406360 Promise. Definitely, I promise.
1406440 1407820 Good, I like<br />you here.
1407900 1409400 Yeah? Well, I like<br />being here.
1409490 1410650 Are you getting hungry?
1410780 1412280 Huh? You want some breakfast?<br />Yeah.
1412410 1413700 What do you want, Wheaties?<br />Yeah.
1413780 1415370 What are Wheaties?<br />Champions!
1415450 1417410 Breakfast of what?<br />Champions! Champions.
1418910 1422040 ROCKY: And the father bear, he says,<br />"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed."
1422120 1425790 And the little kid bear said,<br />"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
1425880 1427250 "and there she is."
1427340 1429090 Thereby, he pulls<br />back the covers,
1429170 1432890 and thereby exposing her to<br />the, you know, public, see?
1432980 1435140 Come on, eat your cereal<br />before it sinks. Hurry up.
1435220 1437600 Then what happened<br />to Goldilocks?
1437680 1439270 Happened to her?<br />I'm not exactly sure.
1439350 1441810 Busted for trespassing and<br />got 30 days in the cooler.
1441890 1443390 Oh, that's real<br />nice, Paulie.
1443560 1445100 That's nice<br />to tell the kid.
1445190 1448900 Rocky. Rocky,<br />the car is waiting.
1448980 1450280 Go ahead. You<br />guys better go.
1450360 1451860 Be a good boy, now.
1451950 1453450 We'll have a fun time,<br />me and the kid.
1453530 1454490 All right.
1454570 1457200 Mrs. Stallion, you<br />almost look pretty good.
1457280 1459160 Oh, thank you, Paulie.
1459700 1461580 Don't give the kid<br />any beer, all right?
1461660 1465080 Okay, we got to go. And Paulie, don't<br />take him to the track, all right?
1465170 1466630 How you doing, Mick?
1466710 1467920 MICKEY: Pretty good.
1469460 1471880 Now, we got a problem<br />in the seventh.
1492490 1495860 Whatever happened to them<br />quiet, tender moments, huh?
1513300 1515800 Thank you. Thank you,<br />one and all.
1516090 1520220 Every once in a while, a person<br />comes along who defies the odds.

1538530 1542200 it is with tremendous honor<br />that we present this memorial
1542290 1545000 which will stand<br />always as a celebration
1545120 1547870 to the indomitable<br />spirit of man.
1548500 1552340 Philadelphia salutes its<br />favorite son, Rocky Balboa!
1564720 1566020 It's beautiful.
1566100 1568350 Definitely a thing<br />of beauty.
1568980 1571560 CROWD:<br />Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1571650 1579650 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
1584120 1585490 Thank you.
1589670 1591420 Thank you very much.
1596170 1599840 I don't know, what do you<br />say to something like this?
1602510 1604390 About three years ago,
1605470 1610600 this city really took<br />me inside, you know?
1613690 1617990 And I want to thank you very much for that.<br />I really do.
1619320 1621200 And I've been<br />thinking that...
1621280 1624780 I wasn't gonna bring this up,<br />but I might as well, now.
1625540 1629500 I would never do anything<br />to hurt this sport
1629580 1633710 that has been<br />so really good to me.
1634630 1639010 I've been talking it over<br />with my wife and my manager,
1640720 1642470 and we think that...
1643350 1646720 It's really hard to do this.<br />I feel like a bum.
1647640 1650560 I'm thinking maybe<br />it's time that I should
1651440 1655940 step down, maybe,<br />and retire.
1656020 1659490 CROWD:<br />No! No! No!
1659570 1661990 WOMAN: No, you can't<br />do that, Rocky.
1662070 1663450 Getting out<br />while you can?
1663530 1666160 Don't give this sucker no statue.<br />Give him guts.
1666240 1667990 I told you<br />I wasn't going away.
1668080 1669750 You got your shot,<br />now give me mine.
1669830 1671500 Why don't you get<br />the hell out of there!
1671620 1673230 Shut up, old man.<br />I ain't going nowhere.
1673320 1675930 Why don't you tell all these nice<br />folks why you been ducking me?
1676020 1678670 Politics, man. This country<br />wants to keep me down.
1678760 1679780 Keep everybody weak.
1679780 1681640 They don't want a man like<br />me to have the title,
1681640 1683620 because I'm not a puppet<br />like that fool up there.
1683620 1685560 You know, you've got<br />a big mouth, you know.
1685600 1688600 Why don't you come down and<br />close it, Balboa? Come on!
1688680 1689930 Anytime.
1690020 1691780 That guy's crazy.<br />Don't listen to him.
1691860 1693380 The little man don't<br />wanna come to me,
1693460 1695480 then I'll come to you people<br />and lay out the truth.
1695560 1697440 I am ranked<br />number one. One!
1697520 1698730 That means<br />I'm the best.
1698820 1701820 But this bum is taking the easy<br />matches, fighting other bums.
1701900 1703650 I'm telling you<br />and everybody here
1703740 1706160 I'll fight him anywhere,<br />anytime, for nothing.
1706320 1709590 MAN: Fight him,<br />Rock! Fight him!
1709670 1711580 But you people ain't never<br />gonna see that happen
1711660 1712960 because he's<br />gonna retire.
1713040 1715710 You see? He don't<br />fight no real man.
1715790 1717330 He fights them setups.<br />What?
1717420 1719250 You're a disgrace<br />to the sport.
1719340 1720630 Shut up, old man!<br />You and that chump
1720710 1722420 don't know where<br />I had to come from.
1722510 1724340 Balboa, your family's<br />doing real nice, ain't it?
1724430 1726590 You call yourself a fighter?<br />Prove it now.
1726680 1728470 Give me the<br />same chance.
1728560 1730510 The way he's been<br />ducking me is a disgrace.
1730600 1732730 If he ain't no coward, why<br />don't he fight me, then?
1732730 1734470 I can't listen to any more of this.<br />Hey, anytime...
1734470 1736430 I don't care<br />what you're ranked.
1736480 1738270 You don't get no shot,<br />and I mean that!
1738270 1740270 CLUBBER: I'm glad you<br />people are seeing this here.
1740270 1742090 What are you doing?<br />I want to fight this guy.
1742100 1743390 Well, you got him.
1743390 1745270 But you'll fight<br />him without me.
1746160 1747660 What are you saying?<br />It's finished.
1747740 1748990 Yes, I'm finished.
1749080 1750370 I don't want<br />no more of this.
1750450 1752450 I don't want no more,<br />you understand?
1752540 1755120 None of it!<br />It's over with!
1757000 1760250 Hey, woman. Hey, woman!<br />Listen here.
1760340 1762170 Since your man<br />ain't got no heart,
1762260 1764130 maybe you'd like<br />to see a real man.
1764220 1765630 I bet you stay up<br />late every night
1765720 1767510 dreaming you had<br />a real man, don't you?
1767590 1769510 I'll tell you what. Bring<br />your pretty little self
1769600 1771260 over to my<br />apartment tonight,
1771350 1772720 and I'll show you<br />a real man.
1772810 1774770 You want it,<br />you got it!
1780690 1781730 You got it!
1788360 1791740 Rocky, don't. Come on, Rocky,<br />please, let's go talk.
1791830 1794080 Adrian.<br />Rocky, don't.
1794160 1796870 Rocky! Let's talk.
1801590 1802750 ROCKY: Why'd you leave?
1802840 1804340 Why'd you walk<br />away like that?
1804420 1806340 Life's too<br />short, kid.
1807220 1808630 Where you going?
1808720 1811390 I'm going on a<br />permanent vacation.
1812390 1814640 What are you talking about?<br />We got one more fight.
1814720 1816770 No, no. Not we, you.
1818600 1820560 Why are you<br />doing this?
1825320 1826780 I said, why are<br />you doing this?
1826860 1828990 Because you can't<br />win, Rock!
1829070 1832320 This guy will kill you to<br />death inside of three rounds!
1832410 1833450 You're crazy.
1833540 1834700 What else is new?
1834790 1835950 He's just<br />another fighter.
1836040 1838040 No, he ain't just<br />another fighter.
1838120 1841710 This guy is a wrecking<br />machine, and he's hungry!
1841790 1844340 Hell, you ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt!
1844420 1846710 What are you talking about?<br />I've had 10 title defenses.
1846800 1847970 That was easy!
1848050 1849130 What do you<br />mean, easy?
1849220 1851010 They was hand-picked!
1854180 1856850 Setups?<br />No, they weren't setups.
1856930 1860690 They was good fighters, but they<br />wasn't killers like this guy.
1860770 1863310 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
1883130 1884630 Jeez, Mick.
1886960 1888550 Why'd you do it?
1891130 1893550 Because the beating<br />that you got
1893640 1895850 from Apollo should<br />have killed you, kid.
1896140 1897180 It didn't.
1897270 1901480 It was my job to keep you winning<br />and to keep you healthy.
1907320 1910490 You really don't think I<br />got nothing left, do you?
1911280 1915370 Well, Rock, let's<br />put it this way.
1917160 1919790 Three years ago<br />you was supernatural.
1920660 1924170 You was... You was<br />hard and you was nasty
1924250 1927290 and you had<br />this cast-iron jaw.
1928340 1932760 But then the worst<br />thing happened to you
1932840 1935760 that could happen<br />to any fighter.
1935850 1939060 You got civilized. Yeah.
1943600 1945400 Don't worry, kid.
1945770 1950440 You know, presidents<br />retire, generals retire,
1950530 1954360 horses retire,<br />Man o' War retired.
1954780 1956820 They put him<br />out to stud.
1957990 1960700 That's what you<br />should've done, retire.
1964330 1966920 I can't retire knowing<br />all this, Mick.
1967500 1970250 Don't push it. Well,<br />you been carrying me.
1970710 1972050 We don't need it.
1972130 1973670 You been carrying<br />me, though.
1974510 1976300 I haven't been<br />carrying you.
1976390 1977510 I've been<br />protecting you.
1977600 1980930 No. Look, I want this fight.<br />Just one more.
1981020 1982220 No, we don't need it.
1982310 1984230 I'll live in the gym.
1984310 1985440 We don't need it.
1985520 1986940 Mick, I do.
1988150 1990270 I'm asking you to train<br />me one last time.
1990360 1992440 Oh, no, I can't.
1992530 1993820 If you don't,
1995110 1998320 I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't bought<br />a new pair of underwear in 10 years.
2000410 2002160 You would,<br />wouldn't you?
2002250 2003910 Yeah, absolutely.
2006580 2008250 No, no.
2008330 2009580 Come on.
2011420 2013800 One more time,<br />it's over.
2015390 2016720 It's a deal?<br />Come on, come on.
2016800 2019300 It's your head, kid.<br />It's your head.
2022810 2025520 Yeah, it is.<br />Thanks, Mick.

2031190 2034440 Pushin', every<br />day and night
2035990 2039240 Pushin', gettin' ready<br />for the fight

2080990 2083410 MICKEY: You can't stand<br />toe-to-toe with this guy
2083490 2086040 or he'll deposit<br />you up there on Mars.
2086290 2089040 He's too tough.<br />He's too strong.
2090370 2094800 Listen, how the hell can we<br />train in this creep joint here?
2094920 2096340 I mean, this is<br />kind of a house
2096420 2098260 of ill reputes or<br />something, isn't it?
2098340 2100260 Why did you<br />rent this joint?
2100340 2102840 Oh, come on, Mickey. Let's<br />go out in style, okay?

2108940 2111390 Let's get some blood and<br />sweat and tears around you!
2111480 2112900 Can we do that?
2112980 2115940 Hey, will you just relax<br />and enjoy it, okay?
2120150 2121820 They love it, Mick.
2129040 2131540 MICKEY: Go on, fight!<br />Fight now, go ahead!
2131620 2134210 Fight it, fight it.<br />Get rough, get tough.
2134290 2136040 Get brutal.<br />That's it.
2136130 2138090 Excuse me. Could I get a kiss?
2138170 2139260 Yeah, sure.
2139720 2141300 Get out of here,<br />will you?
2141380 2143050 This is like<br />fighting in a zoo.
2143140 2144760 This is a zoo,<br />you know?
2144850 2146640 Is that the way you<br />train for Clubber?
2146720 2148140 He ain't gonna<br />kiss you.
2148220 2150180 He's gonna kill you,<br />you know that?
2150270 2151390 Go on. Get<br />out of here!
2157230 2159360 Rock, how about a picture?<br />Yeah, sure.
2159440 2160740 There you go.<br />Rock.
2172120 2173710 WOMEN: Rocky! Rocky!
2201280 2204030 Put a little<br />speed on there.
2204110 2206280 Thattaboy.<br />That's it.
2215580 2218000 All right, this will<br />tell us the story.
2218090 2222510 That's it! Side to side!<br />Side to side, Rock!
2223300 2225130 Shut up back there,<br />can't you?
2225220 2226720 Change your tune or...
2226800 2229640 That's it. Pull front punches.<br />That's it, kid.
2229720 2231100 You're a deadly weapon.
2231180 2234060 Time! Time, time,<br />time. Quit it.
2234520 2236310 You're okay.<br />Come on.
2237020 2239200 Here. Put this on before<br />you catch pneumonia.
2239280 2241230 ROCKY: Okay. I'll give you<br />a little rubdown, too.
2241320 2243400 Yeah.<br />And listen, kid.
2243490 2247740 I don't like to hear much of what<br />comes out of people's mouths
2247820 2250450 and I don't like<br />soft-talking moments.
2250530 2251620 That's for sure.
2251700 2253910 You know, but I just wanna<br />tell you one thing,
2254000 2255580 that I'm proud<br />of you.
2257080 2258210 Well, thanks<br />a lot.
2258290 2259460 That's all<br />right, kid.
2259540 2261340 Let's get out of here, shall we?<br />Hey, Mick.
2261420 2262430 Yeah?
2262510 2264420 What do you think we're gonna<br />do when it's all over, huh?
2264510 2268090 I don't know. Maybe join up with a<br />circus or something. All right.
2268180 2270390 Yeah, maybe. All<br />right, let's get out.
2277230 2279900 NAHAN: Good evening, everyone. Along<br />with Bill Baldwin, I'm Stu Nahan.
2279980 2282400 And we welcome you to tonight's<br />heavyweight title fight
2282570 2285070 which may prove to be<br />the most memorable of all.
2285150 2286780 For tonight is<br />the champion's final
2286860 2289280 and perhaps most<br />difficult title defense.
2289370 2291530 Rocky, do you feel you're in<br />the best shape of your career?
2291620 2293450 Oh, yeah, absolutely.<br />I feel real good.
2293540 2296170 He's a deadly weapon, he's one of a kind.<br />And he's gonna do it.
2296260 2298120 REPORTER 1: Clubber, do you<br />think you're as fast as Balboa?
2298130 2299990 I don't wanna do no talking.<br />I'll do my talking in the ring.
2299990 2301830 REPORTER 2: Clubber,<br />dance for us.
2303630 2305090 I told you, you better<br />get out of here!
2305170 2306550 I want to be alone!
2306630 2308300 REPORTER 3: Will you<br />retire after this fight?
2308380 2310030 Oh, yeah, this is<br />the last one for sure.
2310030 2311570 After this, me and<br />Mick are finished.
2311680 2313220 This is definitely<br />the last one.
2313310 2315180 You're all parasites<br />and leeches.
2315270 2316430 Get out of here!
2316520 2318810 REPORTER 4: What will<br />you do after tonight?
2319600 2321560 I'm not sure.
2321650 2323520 Maybe join the circus,<br />huh, Mick?
2323610 2325610 Yeah, have some fun.
2325690 2326990 REPORTER 1: Come on,<br />take your robe off.
2327070 2329700 REPORTER 2: Come on,<br />take off your robe!
2329780 2332320 I told you to<br />get out of my face!
2332410 2333830 With us this evening<br />is the former
2333910 2335240 heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
2335330 2336480 Apollo Creed.
2336560 2338200 Do you have any predictions<br />on this fight?
2338290 2340250 How do you see this<br />fight going tonight?
2340330 2343170 Well, I feel that strength would<br />have to go to the challenger,
2343250 2345250 while experience and<br />the world's hardest head
2345340 2346670 would have to go<br />to Rocky Balboa.
2346760 2347960 And you know<br />I know about that.
2348340 2351010 Now remember, Rock,<br />don't trade with this guy.
2351090 2353050 Take your time.<br />Wear him down.
2353180 2355180 But don't stand toe-to-toe with him.<br />Mmm-hmm.
2355260 2358270 This punk's never been<br />15 rounds before.
2358930 2360520 Take him good.<br />Okay.
2360600 2361940 Take him good.<br />I will.
2362020 2363400 That's it.
2363420 2365480 So I predict that the champ's<br />gonna take this one.
2365480 2368190 Now, wait a minute. Do you really<br />think the champ can hit that hard?
2369150 2371080 Why do you think I'm<br />sitting out here with you?
2389260 2390420 Hey, sucker!
2390510 2392430 Balboa, you gone,<br />you finished!
2392510 2395180 You through! You washed up!<br />I'm the baddest in the world!
2395260 2396640 You don't look<br />so bad to me.
2396720 2398060 What you say,<br />paper champion?
2398060 2399240 I'm gonna beat<br />you like a dog.
2399310 2400390 A dog, you hear me!
2400480 2402390 Can't you get that<br />ape back into the ring?
2402480 2404650 You made me wait too long!<br />You gonna pay!
2404730 2406730 Come on, mouth!<br />Get out of my way.
2406820 2408530 MICKEY: Get him out<br />of there, can't you?
2408610 2410320 Get him out of there!
2414350 2415870 Get out of my way!<br />Get out of my way!
2415950 2418080 MAN: Back up.
2418160 2420080 CLUBBER: You know who I am?<br />You know who I am?
2420160 2422080 I'm the man!<br />I'm the man!
2425790 2429170 You're dead meat! You're dead meat!<br />Let me go!
2429260 2431590 Rocky! Rocky!
2431670 2433220 Get off!
2433300 2434930 What's the<br />matter? Mick!
2435010 2437390 What's wrong, Adrian?<br />Get a doctor!
2437470 2439850 Somebody get a doctor!<br />Come on!

2454360 2456470 Move! Mick, will<br />you sit on the...

2458770 2460120 No! The fight's<br />not off.
2460120 2461880 What, are you out of<br />your mind or something?
2461880 2463390 The fight's on.<br />Are you crazy?
2463390 2465250 ROCKY: Mick, we can't. Not tonight.<br />I ain't fighting...
2465250 2466840 Yes, tonight.<br />We're gonna fight.
2466840 2468840 Just let me get my breath.<br />Can't I get my breath?
2468850 2470230 Is that against the<br />rules or something?
2470230 2472150 Mick... Will you<br />please get a doctor?
2472170 2473950 Paulie, go on.<br />He's on his way.
2473950 2475630 Mick, I can't go out there<br />and fight like this.
2475630 2476880 I can't<br />go out there like this.
2476930 2479640 Now, get out there.<br />Get going, will you?
2479720 2481100 Take him.<br />Take him good.
2481180 2482470 Get it over with,<br />why don't you?

2490400 2493440 After all these years together,<br />you don't know what to do?
2493530 2494990 You ought to be<br />ashamed of yourself.

2803960 2805050 I'll try.
2806670 2808840 BALDWIN: Rocky appears<br />to be staggering.
2809010 2810470 Yeah, I'll get him.
2810550 2812760 Coming out of the corner,<br />here comes Clubber.

2829610 2831700 My gosh, what a<br />beating he's taking.
2836580 2838500 Don't stand toe-to-toe with him!
2838580 2840210 CLUBBER:<br />Come on, Balboa!
2858680 2859890 Get up!
2859980 2863190 CLUBBER:<br />Get up, sucker!
2863270 2865480 REFEREE: Five. Six.<br />Come on, get up! Get up!
2865570 2871030 Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.<br />You're out!
2871080 2872410 NAHAN: The champion<br />is finished!
2872410 2874520 CLUBBER: I did it! I'm the best!<br />In the second round!
2874520 2875730 I'm the man!<br />I beat Balboa!
2875730 2877310 Unbelievable.<br />Incredible upset.
2877320 2880900 Balboa in the corner, out on his feet.<br />Out of the plank.
2886380 2888420 ANNOUNCER:<br />We have the time.
2888510 2890380 The winner by knockout,
2890470 2895930 the new heavyweight champion<br />of the world, Clubber Lang!
2896010 2900220 CLUBBER: Yeah, I told you.<br />I told you I'd do it.
2900310 2903350 Yeah! I'm the new<br />champ of the world!
2911870 2913240 PAULIE: Come on,<br />get out of here!
2913320 2914820 Get out of here, now.
2919490 2920700 Oh, Rocky,<br />what happened?
2920790 2921910 I'm all right,<br />how's Mick?
2921920 2923840 He wouldn't go to the<br />hospital till you got here.
2923840 2925760 What? DOCTOR: Mr. Balboa,<br />time is important.
2925760 2927930 We must get him to the<br />hospital immediately.
2927960 2929050 Okay.
2943060 2944100 Mick?
2944850 2946230 Yeah?
2946310 2947520 Mick.
2949400 2953530 What? What? What?<br />Is it over?
2954030 2957320 Yeah, it's all over.
2957660 2961040 Hey, listen,<br />what happened?
2962120 2963830 It was a knockout.
2965710 2968080 What round?<br />What round?
2968170 2970000 Second round.
2972210 2973760 Yeah, I knew it.
2973840 2976380 That's good.<br />We did it, huh?
2976470 2979260 We did it. We did it. All right.
2979350 2981310 You don't have to worry<br />about nothing no more.
2981390 2982640 No. Good.
2982720 2984140 Everything's gonna<br />be okay, Mick.
2984230 2986270 You know? Yeah. I<br />knew that we did it.
2986350 2988730 You gotta get<br />to the hospital.
2988860 2991190 You're not as young<br />as you used to be.
2991270 2993860 You're the winner.
2993940 2996700 We did everything right.<br />I did everything...
2996780 2999660 No, no, listen. We ain't<br />done everything right.
2999740 3001660 Listen, we got<br />more to do.
3001740 3004830 Mick, whatever you wanna<br />do, we'll do it, okay?
3004910 3007670 I love you, kid.<br />I love you.
3008920 3010750 Mick?
3010840 3012630 It hurts me.
3015220 3016820 Mick?
3030610 3031940 Mick.
3043990 3046200 Oh, God!
3052630 3056420 Don't go away,<br />please, don't.
3056510 3059380 All the things<br />we didn't do.
3059470 3062390 We got more<br />to do. We got...
3063640 3068310 Oh, my God!<br />Oh, Jesus.
3127290 3129700 This concludes<br />our service.
3304130 3306420 APOLLO: That's not<br />the way to do it.
3306510 3307880 ROCKY: Who's that?
3309220 3312180 Why don't you hit it straight?<br />Step into it.
3314560 3316350 Apollo?
3316430 3319390 Right. I waited at your<br />house for about an hour
3319480 3322100 and your wife said<br />you might be here.
3322480 3324060 What are you<br />doing here?
3324190 3325730 Business.
3327320 3329190 If the papers knew we<br />were talking like this,
3329280 3331410 they'd think<br />we was crazy.
3331990 3333320 Why you?
3333410 3336620 Because I'm the best, and you need<br />somebody to teach you different.
3336750 3338870 - Why?<br />- Well, to be honest with you,
3338960 3341210 I don't think you could pull<br />it off without me, Rock.
3341290 3345880 You still didn't give me the answer, Apollo.<br />What's the real reason?
3345960 3348260 Listen. It's quiet,<br />isn't it?
3349720 3351970 When you retire,<br />it's too quiet.
3352090 3354390 I mean, we're too<br />young to retire anyway.
3354470 3356620 Besides, with<br />the right touch,
3356710 3359220 I could promote this thing into<br />the biggest gig of all time.
3359300 3360990 It'd be bigger<br />than ours.
3361080 3365290 Heaven knows, I don't mind being<br />involved with large numbers, right?
3366730 3369280 I don't need this<br />no more. I...
3369360 3371490 I don't want<br />this no more.
3372240 3377490 Look, man. When you beat<br />me, I hurt all over
3377580 3381790 and I didn't want to know from<br />nothing or nobody, not even my kids.
3381870 3383960 Hell, every fighter<br />knows that hurt.
3384040 3387210 And we get sick inside trying to<br />live with it, so don't back off now.
3387300 3391220 Make it right for yourself or<br />you'll be sorry you didn't.
3391300 3394720 We held the greatest title<br />in the whole world, babe.
3396640 3399060 You lost that fight, Rock,<br />for all the wrong reasons.
3399140 3401520 You lost your edge.
3401600 3406480 All right, I know your manager dying<br />had you all messed up inside.
3407480 3410190 But the truth is, you<br />didn't look hungry.
3410900 3412780 Now, when we fought,
3413780 3416820 you had that eye of the<br />tiger, man, the edge.
3416910 3418240 And now you<br />gotta get it back.
3418330 3420620 And the way to get it back is<br />to go back to the beginning.
3420700 3423870 You know<br />what I mean?
3423960 3426500 Maybe we could win<br />it back together.
3428250 3430130 Eye of the tiger, man.
3433970 3436090 Why'd you have<br />to come here?
3437100 3439510 I have the plan.<br />Get back, man.
3442600 3444350 You got me curious.
3446350 3448360 You got me curious, Rock.
3453110 3457160 Clubber, do you accept the challenge<br />for a rematch with Balboa?
3457240 3460620 I reject the challenge, because<br />Balboa is no challenge.
3460700 3463160 But I'd be more than happy<br />to beat up on him some more.
3463250 3465000 I always said<br />he was nothing.
3465080 3466790 I can't wait to<br />see this bum fall.
3466880 3469960 What do you think of him being<br />trained by Apollo Creed?
3470040 3471340 CLUBBER: Apollo who?
3471420 3473250 You talking about that<br />old fool, Apollo Creed?
3473270 3475840 Shucks, one has-been teaching another.<br />Yeah, just keep talking, pal.
3475840 3477290 That's all Apollo been doing...<br />Keep talking.
3477290 3478670 ...running off at<br />the mouth lately.
3478720 3480930 And when I see him, I'm<br />gonna close it for him.
3481010 3483680 All right. When will<br />the match take place?
3483770 3484930 The sooner,<br />the better.
3485020 3486230 I'm the champion<br />of the world.
3486310 3487690 And nothing can<br />be done about that.
3487770 3490060 I can't be beat,<br />and I won't be beat.
3490150 3491770 This time I'm gonna<br />train even harder.
3491860 3493400 There won't be no<br />quick knockdowns.
3493490 3494780 I'm gonna torture him.
3494860 3497070 I'm gonna crucify<br />him real bad.
3497240 3499450 Hard words<br />from a hard man.
3499530 3503410 The odds against Balboa<br />making a comeback at 34
3503500 3505250 are very long indeed.
3505330 3508500 Can he do it?<br />Most experts doubt it.
3508580 3513840 Balboa was a fine champion, but his<br />time has passed. I wish him luck.
3515090 3516970 Don't listen<br />to it, Rocky.
3517050 3519640 No, do listen<br />to it, Rock.
3519720 3524100 When this is over, a lot of folks are<br />gonna owe you an engraved apology.
3526070 3527560 And you're gonna<br />owe me a big favor.
3527640 3529190 What favor?
3529940 3531810 When it's over.
3537110 3540410 PAULIE: Rocko, come on. We're<br />gonna be late at the airport.
3541570 3543740 Let's go. ADRIAN: Think<br />we forgot anything?
3544120 3546620 ROCKY: I think we have it all.<br />Maybe another sweater.
3546700 3548500 No, California's<br />not that cold.
3548580 3550330 It's great, great.<br />A scorcher.
3550420 3552830 Okay, listen, I want you<br />to be a good boy, okay?
3552960 3555380 Okay. And don't give<br />anybody a hard time.
3555460 3559720 Okay.<br />Give me a kiss. Yeah.
3565970 3568850 We'll call when we land.<br />Yeah, we'll call.
3572860 3575230 You'll be a good<br />boy? All right.
3575320 3577690 I'll bring you<br />back something.
3592380 3594750 I been told by
3596090 3598510 Some people and they all
3599720 3602010 Say to take you back
3604180 3606720 Take you back like before
3608270 3611180 I don't call that a reason
3612560 3618030 I just call it<br />believin' in myself
3618780 3621320 Believin' in myself
3623280 3624870 What the hell are<br />we doing here in LA?
3624960 3626280 Hey, man, this is<br />where I started.
3626370 3627450 Yeah, so?
3627540 3629200 So this is<br />where he's starting.
3629290 3630450 But this place<br />is disgusting.
3630460 3631740 Why don't we stay<br />at your place?
3631740 3633330 Look, I think you're<br />missing the point.
3633330 3635910 Let's just go on and check in and<br />get over to the gym, all right?
3635910 3638370 Rock, in my opinion,<br />we don't need this place.
3638380 3640130 It's below you and the<br />sister's standard.
3640210 3643510 We're gonna give it a try, Paulie.<br />Come on, Adrian.
3654770 3656520 I don't even<br />have a gun.
3664140 3665280 PAULIE: You know,<br />fun is fun.
3665370 3669120 I like those kind of things, but this<br />I don't like. Look at this place.
3669200 3672660 Rats even have more pride<br />than to be caught dead here.
3673670 3675750 I mean, look<br />at the dump.
3675830 3677040 I just don't like it.
3677130 3679710 Think of Adrian's health.<br />ADRIAN: I'm fine, Paulie.
3702690 3703900 MAN 1: Balboa.
3703990 3705280 MAN 2: What's he<br />doing out here?
3711740 3713870 This is where<br />I started.
3713960 3715460 That's your problem.
3715870 3717960 Rocko, let's leave before<br />they leave us for dead.
3721300 3724260 Yeah, you see that look<br />in their eyes, Rock?
3725760 3727340 When we fought, Rock,<br />I trained hard,
3727340 3728870 but I didn't have<br />that look in my eyes.
3728870 3731010 You had it.<br />You won.
3732810 3735060 You gotta get<br />that look back, Rock.
3735140 3736730 Eye of the tiger, man.
3736810 3738520 Eye of the tiger,<br />come on.
3738600 3740440 Come on, let's go.
3740520 3743480 Look at this place.<br />No class in here.
3743570 3744900 Is he always<br />so cheerful?
3744990 3746320 I don't sweat you.
3746400 3748740 Hey. Hey, Paulie. Don't<br />get mentally irregular.
3748820 3750160 It's a free country.
3750240 3751950 Just don't get<br />irregular, all right?
3752030 3754190 I don't need no<br />philosophy lesson here.
3754270 3756410 Well, it just takes about<br />six years to get to know...
3756500 3758960 Well, I ain't<br />got six years.
3759040 3761460 Hey, come on,<br />Paulie. Just relax.
3761590 3764000 Come on. We're on business.
3767220 3769130 Hey! Hey, champ!
3769220 3771000 Hey, Duke, my man.
3771090 3772850 Hey, everything's set up<br />and ready to go, baby.
3772930 3774600 Good. I know you know who<br />this man is, don't you?
3774680 3776360 Yeah. It's gonna be<br />good working with you.
3776390 3778270 Certainly had enough<br />of working against you.
3778350 3780020 Hey, how you feel?<br />Pretty good, thanks.
3780020 3781720 He's doing great. We've<br />been living modern,
3781730 3783040 but now we're<br />gonna train old.
3783040 3785440 I'm going over here and talk to<br />some of the guys, all right.
3785440 3787320 DUKE: Hey! The<br />champ is home!
3789700 3792450 We gotta leave.<br />I got a reputation.
3792530 3793700 What do you mean,<br />reputation?
3793790 3796240 You heard. I don't<br />like these people.
3796330 3798250 You don't like them?
3799670 3802460 Maybe they don't like<br />you either, Paulie.
3802540 3804420 What'd I do to them?
3805630 3807340 And they call<br />me punchy.
3807420 3810630 Hey, Stallion, Stallion, come on over<br />here and meet some of the fellas.
3810720 3812180 I'll be right back.
3812260 3814050 How you doing, guys?
3825360 3827980 APOLLO: That's it, that's it.<br />Come on, on the toes.
3828070 3829490 On the toes,<br />on the toes.
3829570 3831110 On the toes, come on.
3831200 3832700 On the toes,<br />on the toes.
3833740 3835240 Come on, Rock.
3835990 3838080 He ain't too graceful.
3838160 3839830 That's why we're<br />here, Paulie.
3840120 3842540 Waste of time.<br />He's got heavy feet.
3842630 3844170 DUKE: Get on the balls<br />of your feet.
3844250 3846010 Come on, relax, Rock.
3846100 3848210 Come on, get those feet out<br />of the concrete. Come on.
3848300 3850300 It'll take time,<br />but it'll come.
3850380 3853700 He can't train to<br />the jungle junk music.
3853730 3856010 DUKE: Come on, relax, Rock. APOLLO: Here we go.<br />Here we go, come on.
3856140 3857970 DUKE: On the balls of your feet.<br />APOLLO: Balance.
3858060 3859300 Let your body<br />find the rhythm.
3859380 3861810 APOLLO: Gonna start a new<br />dance called the crawl.
3861890 3864520 I'm telling you, you can't train<br />him like a colored fighter.
3864610 3865770 He ain't got<br />no rhythm.
3865860 3866980 All right?<br />Come on.
3867070 3868070 How stupid<br />do I look?
3868150 3869650 You look great.<br />You look great.
3869740 3872780 Everything we do works off the jab.<br />You can do it.
3873610 3874700 Yeah.
3875700 3876950 Can he swim?
3877080 3878290 With a name<br />like Rock?
3878910 3880500 APOLLO: No time to<br />waste! Let's go!
3880580 3882080 Another lap!<br />Another lap!
3882160 3884080 Move it!<br />Another lap!
3884170 3886440 He ain't no tuna. We<br />belong back in the gym.
3886530 3888170 Look, he's gotta stretch<br />and use muscles
3888250 3890210 he never thought he had.<br />Come on, Rock!
3890300 3891720 Come on, stretch now!
3891800 3893340 Come on, move it,<br />Rock! Move it!
3893430 3894590 Nobody can<br />change that much.
3894680 3897050 He's a bruiser.<br />He ain't no boxer.
3897140 3899060 You keep telling him that<br />and he'll be nothing.
3899140 3900520 You know?<br />Yeah?
3900600 3902480 Another lap! Come on now!<br />Move it!
3903690 3906020 Move it! Come on! Move it, Rock!<br />Move it!
3906110 3908060 Come on, let's go.<br />Let's go!
3908230 3910230 That's it, stretch it!<br />Stretch it out!
3910320 3913280 That's it, let's go. You gotta pull.<br />Hard now, hard!
3921450 3924660 Shut up, you Sterno bums!<br />I'll squash you!
3925170 3927040 There's decent people<br />trying to sleep!
3927130 3929750 Shut up, you honky<br />scum bastard mother!
3930460 3932630 Who needs<br />this sick place?
3932970 3934170 I don't.
3935640 3936890 No class.
3940510 3942680 DUKE: Damn, that<br />Clubber's strong.
3943230 3945480 Fifteen rounds is<br />a long time.
3946940 3949060 We gotta put<br />him away early.
3950520 3951780 I figure with the<br />pace we gotta set,
3951860 3955320 Rock can last maybe<br />seven or eight rounds.
3956990 3959780 Then we'll be<br />out of steam, man.
3959870 3962040 We got to put<br />him away early.
3965540 3967540 ADRIAN: At least<br />the water's hot.
3970960 3973590 Well, we never really<br />had a honeymoon.
3975800 3977380 It's not so bad.
3979850 3981930 We've been in<br />worse places.
3983430 3985640 NAHAN: In the corner, Rocky's<br />in trouble in round two!
3985730 3987060 He takes a right!<br />Another right!
3987140 3989060 He's been cut!<br />Rocky's been cut!
3991230 3994320 APOLLO: Come on, Rock.<br />Come on, come on, now.
3994400 3996820 Come on. You gotta get tougher.<br />You gotta get tougher.
3996900 3998320 Think smooth.<br />Think smooth.
3998410 3999570 Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.
3999660 4001870 Toes, toes, on<br />your toes, Rock.
4001950 4004120 On your toes! On your toes!<br />On your toes!
4005370 4007830 Push yourself, Rock!<br />Concentrate.
4007920 4009580 Let's move it, Rock!<br />Move it, now!
4009670 4011540 Come on, Rock,<br />come on!
4011630 4014380 Have fun with this.<br />Have fun with it.
4014960 4017010 That's it.<br />Easy, easy, easy.
4017130 4019180 Smooth. On the toes.
4019260 4021590 Don't push it, don't push it.<br />Let it come.
4021680 4024350 It'll come. This<br />takes time, baby.
4024430 4026220 This takes time. DUKE:<br />Come on, move your head.
4026310 4029190 Move your head. Move<br />your head up and down.
4029270 4032400 Come on, come on. Swift now, up and down.<br />In and out.
4032480 4035940 Inside. Inside.<br />Inside, baby.
4036030 4037240 Side to side.<br />Move your head.
4037320 4038530 Watch it now.<br />Watch it now.
4038610 4040860 Remember, he's got<br />two hands, right?
4045290 4047370 Damn, man, what the<br />hell are you doing?
4047460 4049710 This guy will knock<br />you on your ass!
4052000 4054040 Come on, Rock,<br />it's not a game.
4054130 4058050 You want to lay up in a hospital<br />for five weeks this time?
4058130 4060550 You thought I was tough?<br />This chump will kill you.
4060630 4061760 All right.
4061840 4064260 Come on, come on. Get your<br />head on your shoulders, man.
4064350 4066390 Think about the fight!<br />Think about the fight!
4066390 4069340 Clubber Lang's in, he's trying to hurt you, Rock.<br />He's trying to hurt you.
4069340 4071800 Okay, here it comes.<br />Jab! He's jabbing!
4071850 4073480 He's jabbing! He's<br />trying to hurt you.
4073560 4075900 You gotta fight.<br />You gotta move.
4077860 4079650 NAHAN: He's up<br />against the ropes!
4079740 4081490 He can't get<br />out of the corner.
4085830 4088290 He's hooked you! He's hooked you!<br />He's hooked you!
4088370 4090160 Damn, Rock, come on!
4091120 4092620 What's the matter<br />with you?
4092710 4094920 Tomorrow. Let's<br />do it tomorrow.
4095000 4098680 There is no tomorrow!
4107200 4109810 APOLLO: Look, there's just one<br />thing that you gotta remember.
4109890 4111680 We gotta get<br />some speed.
4111770 4114690 You gotta get some flexibility.<br />You gotta get some quickness.
4114770 4115980 You understand?
4115980 4117600 Quickness, endurance,<br />that's the end of it.
4117600 4120230 That's the only thing we gotta<br />concern ourselves with, Rock.
4120320 4123030 All right. Mickey<br />never had me do this.
4124160 4126570 Yeah. Okay,<br />here we go.
4128160 4129450 Ready?
4133620 4134620 Set.<br />Yeah.
4134710 4136170 Go!
4136250 4138840 Come on, come on!<br />Dig, dig, dig!
4138920 4140920 Come on! Come on!
4148680 4150180 Come on!
4151520 4153390 MICKEY: You<br />can't win, Rock.
4154940 4157980 You ain't been hungry<br />since you won that belt.
4159190 4161730 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
4205280 4206950 What's the matter?
4208450 4209780 It's over.
4210330 4211830 It's all over.
4222670 4224800 What's the matter<br />with you?
4260330 4262000 ADRIAN: Can I<br />talk to you?
4266670 4267880 I wanna ask you<br />something important
4267970 4270010 and I want you<br />to tell me the truth.
4270890 4272180 What?
4273180 4275060 Why did you come here?
4276350 4278890 I just don't<br />want it no more.
4278980 4282400 If it's over because you want<br />it to be over, I'm glad.
4283110 4284190 I do.
4285610 4289320 It's just, you've never quit<br />anything since I've known you.
4293580 4295700 I don't know what<br />you want me to say.
4295790 4297870 I mean, how?<br />What happened?
4297960 4301040 How did everything that<br />was so good get so bad?
4302040 4304170 What's so bad?<br />Tell me, what?
4304250 4307420 I wrecked everything by<br />not thinking for myself.
4307510 4309670 I mean, why couldn't Mickey<br />tell me where I was really at,
4309760 4311010 right from the start?
4311090 4312720 He didn't have to<br />carry me and lie to me
4312800 4315760 and make me think I was better<br />than I really was when I wasn't.
4315850 4317220 He never lied.
4317310 4319480 Those fights weren't right.<br />They weren't, Adrian.
4319560 4321440 I never fought anybody<br />who was in their prime.
4321520 4323940 There was always some angle<br />to hold on to the title
4324020 4325770 longer than I<br />should have had it.
4325860 4327690 I mean, do you understand<br />what I'm saying here?
4327780 4330490 I understand. But you've gotta<br />understand that he loved you,
4330570 4332360 and that was his job,<br />protecting you.
4332450 4334450 Well, that protecting<br />don't help nothing.
4334530 4335830 It only makes<br />things worse.
4335910 4339370 You wake up after a few years thinking<br />you're a winner, but you're not.
4339460 4340910 You're really a loser.
4341000 4343830 And so we wouldn't have had<br />the title as long. So what?
4343920 4345710 At least it would've<br />been real, Adrian.
4345790 4347050 It was real.
4347130 4349840 Nothing is real if you don't<br />believe in who you are.
4349920 4352430 I don't believe in myself no more.<br />Don't you understand?
4352510 4353890 When a fighter don't<br />believe, that's it.
4353970 4355850 He's finished.<br />It's over. That's it.
4355930 4357600 That's not it!<br />That is it!
4357680 4359100 Why don't you<br />tell me the truth!
4359180 4361310 What are you putting<br />me through, Adrian?
4361390 4362520 You wanna know the truth?
4362600 4364520 The truth is, I don't<br />want to lose what I got.
4364610 4366400 In the beginning, I didn't care<br />about what happened to me.
4366480 4368940 I'd go in a ring, I'd get<br />busted up, I didn't care.
4369030 4370900 But now there's you,<br />there's the kid.
4370990 4372320 I don't wanna<br />lose what I got!
4372400 4374990 What do we have that<br />can't be replaced? What?
4375070 4378120 A house? We got cars.<br />We got money.
4378200 4380200 We got everything<br />but the truth!
4380290 4381870 What's the truth,<br />damn it?
4381960 4384370 I'm afraid, all right?
4384460 4385630 You wanna hear<br />me say it?
4385710 4387840 You wanna break me down?<br />All right, I'm afraid!
4387920 4389920 For the first time in<br />my life, I'm afraid.
4390010 4391460 I'm afraid, too!
4391550 4392920 There's nothing wrong<br />with being afraid.
4393010 4394430 There is.<br />For me there is!
4394510 4395890 Why? You're human,<br />aren't you?
4395970 4398510 Look, I don't know what I am.<br />All I know is I'm a liar,
4398600 4400600 and because of that<br />Mickey ain't here no more.
4400680 4402640 You didn't push<br />him into anything!
4402730 4405400 He was a grown man and he<br />did what he had to do.
4405480 4408900 And you have no right to feel guilty<br />for what happened, you don't!
4408980 4411650 You were a champion. And you did<br />what you were expected to do.
4411740 4414610 You did what I and everybody<br />else thought you should do.
4414700 4417660 And you wanna tell me that those fights weren't real?<br />That you were carried?
4417740 4419080 Well, I don't<br />believe it!
4419160 4420450 But it doesn't matter<br />what I believe.
4420540 4423660 Because you're the one that's gotta<br />carry that fear around inside you.
4423750 4426750 Afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
4426830 4428960 Afraid you're gonna be<br />remembered as a coward,
4429040 4431210 that you're not<br />a man anymore.
4431300 4434550 Well, none of it's true, but it<br />doesn't matter if I tell you.
4434630 4437760 It doesn't matter, because you're<br />the one that's gotta settle it.
4437850 4438930 Get rid of it!
4439010 4440970 Because when all<br />the smoke has cleared
4441060 4443060 and everyone's through<br />chanting your name,
4443140 4444930 it's just gonna be us!
4445020 4446230 And you can't<br />live like this.
4446310 4448230 We can't live like this.
4448310 4450610 Because it's gonna bother you<br />for the rest of your life.
4450690 4453030 Look what it's<br />doing to you now.
4459070 4461990 Apollo thinks you<br />can do it. So do I.
4463160 4465620 But you. You've gotta wanna<br />do it for the right reasons.
4465710 4467500 Not for the guilt<br />over Mickey,
4467580 4470170 not for the people,<br />not for the title,
4470250 4472670 not for money or me,<br />but for you.
4473800 4475800 Just you,<br />just you alone.
4480050 4481850 And if I lose?
4481930 4485390 Then you lose, but at least<br />you lose with no excuses.
4486690 4488480 No fear.
4488560 4491060 And I know you<br />could live with that.
4498820 4500700 How'd you get so tough?
4502870 4504740 I live with a fighter.
4511250 4512920 I really love you.
4520430 4521800 I love you.
4544910 4546870 No, no, no, Rock. No.
4546950 4548660 Just flick it, just flick it.<br />Just flick it.
4555300 4557760 Come on, one more time. Come on!
4568980 4570810 Good. Five more laps.
4573560 4574940 Watch it, watch it,<br />watch it, watch it.
4575020 4576940 There you go, come on.
4605350 4606970 Jab.
4609850 4611890 You got to<br />move it faster.
4617020 4619360 APOLLO: Faster! Faster!<br />Go on. Kick it.
4622400 4623740 Very nice!
4639500 4640670 Move your head.<br />Move your head.
4640760 4642510 Move it.<br />Move your head.
4643130 4645470 That's right, under!<br />Under and over.
4645550 4647720 Up and down.<br />Turn around.
4648180 4649470 That was nice.
4656730 4659480 Come on, pick them up now. On your toes.<br />On your toes.
4659570 4661190 Come on. Come on. Come on.
4661280 4662820 Come on, now. Speed,<br />speed, speed.
4662900 4665490 Faster, faster, faster.<br />Yeah! Good.
4667160 4669240 Ready. Ready.
4676040 4677580 Rocky the fish!
4708370 4709490 Yeah!
4725550 4727090 All right!
4734060 4737060 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br />I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin
4737140 4739400 and we welcome you to<br />Madison Square Garden,
4739480 4742570 a most exciting backdrop for<br />the anxiously awaited rematch
4742730 4745280 between the former<br />champion, Rocky Balboa
4745360 4747900 and the reigning heavyweight<br />champion, Clubber Lang.
4747990 4751950 We now switch to our remote cameras<br />inside the dressing rooms.
4752030 4755080 Would you care to comment on<br />how you plan to fight Balboa?
4755160 4756250 What's your strategy?
4756330 4757410 Don't need any.
4757500 4760830 Balboa's so predictable and stupid,<br />the man comes straight ahead.
4760920 4763710 He's tailor-made for me<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
4763800 4764960 Just make sure you...
4765010 4767800 That's good... turn them over.<br />Good?
4768380 4770380 How does that<br />look? Okay? Huh?
4771050 4773760 No, I don't hate Balboa,<br />but I pity the fool,
4773850 4777390 and I will destroy any man who<br />tries to take what I got.
4781190 4783400 Remember where<br />you came from.
4784190 4786820 Remember what it<br />took to get you here.
4787610 4790070 And you remember what he did<br />to you last time, right?
4790240 4792200 BALDWIN: Since both men<br />are brawlers, Stu,
4792280 4794160 with the edge in power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
4794240 4796290 I would say that<br />the odds are very long
4796370 4798500 against Balboa<br />regaining his title.
4799210 4800920 Now it's your turn.
4801210 4803000 It's your turn, huh?
4804130 4806340 REPORTER: What's your<br />prediction for the fight, then?
4806420 4808380 Prediction?<br />Yes, prediction.
4810880 4811970 Pain.
4812840 4815640 Lang is a brawler who likes<br />to hurt a man to the body.
4815720 4819310 And, you know, Balboa may never<br />have psychologically recovered
4819390 4821940 from that vicious knockout<br />that Clubber laid on him.
4823730 4825060 It's time.
4827190 4828530 Here.<br />What?
4831780 4833820 I want you to wear these.
4836240 4838660 Come on, Apollo,<br />these are
4838750 4841080 the colors that you wore in<br />our first fight together.
4842620 4843750 I can't wear your colors.
4843830 4845130 Just wear it.
4846420 4848380 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
4849590 4851260 Thanks, Apollo.
4851340 4852840 You just<br />make sure you wash them
4852930 4854300 before you bring<br />them back, all right?
4854390 4856100 Will do, will do.
4857470 4858850 Hey, thanks, Apollo.
4858930 4861810 And remember, after this<br />you owe me a favor.
4862980 4864350 What favor?
4864520 4865560 Bill, I have to agree.
4865650 4869650 Toe-to-toe, Lang is utterly<br />devastating and he's much too strong.
4871950 4874360 All right, listen. I just wanna<br />tell you that I'm proud of you.
4874450 4876030 It takes a hell of a man<br />to change, and you did it.
4876030 4877420 You're gonna prove<br />it to them tonight, right?
4877420 4878460 Right.<br />Right.
4878460 4880170 You did good, Apollo.<br />Thanks, Paulie.
4880200 4882250 Okay, let's do<br />it, Paulie.
4883920 4886250 NAHAN: And here comes Rocky,<br />and here comes Apollo,
4886330 4887750 the two former champions.
4887840 4890340 BALDWIN: Look at that United States<br />Marine Corps Color Guard there
4890420 4891710 along with the Drum<br />and Bugle Corps.
4891800 4893010 Aren't they magnificent?
4893090 4894930 Tremendous. Take<br />a look at Rocky.
4895010 4897930 Look at the tenseness in his<br />face, the tautness of that body.
4898010 4899390 Boy does he look<br />serious right now!
4899470 4900760 Oh, that he<br />certainly does.
4900850 4902730 And you know, Stu,<br />the word is that
4902810 4905640 this is Rocky's last fight,<br />win, lose or draw.
4905730 4908060 NAHAN: And there he is,<br />the Italian Stallion,
4908150 4910400 Rocky Balboa, climbing<br />into the ring.
4910480 4912440 Boy, he looks incredibly<br />thin, doesn't he?
4912530 4915070 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
4915160 4917910 BALDWIN: Rocky Balboa, the<br />iron man from Philadelphia!
4917990 4920910 And this crowd is certainly<br />with him tonight. Listen.
4922830 4925000 Balboa doesn't really<br />have any boxing skill.
4925080 4926460 I've never seen<br />a fighter, though,
4926580 4928210 with as much<br />raw determination.
4928290 4930210 Hold it, Stu.
4930300 4932760 And here comes the champion<br />now, Clubber Lang.
4932840 4934840 Listen to this crowd.
4936130 4937680 NAHAN: Take a look<br />at those eyes.
4937760 4941930 I've never seen a guy with<br />such sullen eyes. He is tough.
4942020 4944560 Clubber, go back<br />where you came from!
4946350 4949230 BALDWIN: He even belted a spectator<br />on the way in. Did you see that?
4949310 4950440 Look at that man.
4950520 4951570 Boy, awesome.

5027560 5034060 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5040450 5042410 NAHAN: I'll tell you something.<br />He has so slimmed down.

5061890 5064090 Referee Lou Filippo.
5064510 5066350 Okay, boys,<br />let's go.
5067640 5069430 We went over<br />the rules yesterday.
5069520 5071020 I'm just going to<br />repeat a few of them.
5071350 5073900 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
5073980 5076900 In case of a knockdown, you go<br />to the corner I tell you to
5076980 5079440 and you stay there until<br />I tell you to come out.
5079530 5081990 Is that understood?<br />Any questions?
5082700 5085910 Okay. Let's go back to your corner now.<br />Let's go.
5085990 5087910 I'm gonna bust you up.
5088660 5090000 Go for it.
5092000 5094960 NAHAN: Well, here we go.<br />The war is on.
5095040 5096630 We're just waiting<br />for the bell.
5096710 5098710 Take my belt off. I'm<br />gonna get that chump.
5098800 5100760 Don't let this bum let<br />you fight his fight.
5100840 5102420 You're the best!<br />You're the best!
5102590 5104050 TRAINER: Here you<br />go, champ.
5105080 5106520 Rhythm and power,<br />rhythm and power.
5107310 5108930 Keep that jab up.<br />Thanks.
5109020 5112060 AU DIENCE: Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
5112140 5114390 Rocky! Rocky!<br />Rocky! Rocky!
5114520 5116020 ANNOUNCER: Are we ready<br />for round one now?
5116060 5117230 NAHAN: Should be<br />a great fight.
5117320 5119230 And here we go.
5119320 5122570 And he goes right out of his<br />corner after Clubber Lang!
5122650 5125240 He's throwing rights and<br />lefts into Clubber's face.
5125320 5126740 What a start<br />of a fight here!
5126830 5129200 BALDWIN: Another jab.<br />Another jab.
5130370 5133120 And another! This is not<br />the Rocky we expected!
5133210 5134540 He looks fantastic.
5134620 5136420 He's fighting more<br />like Apollo Creed.
5139090 5140630 NAHAN: Another right!
5140710 5143760 A right! Look at that, right<br />and left to the head!
5143840 5146140 BALDWIN: Clubber Lang doesn't<br />know what's happening right now.
5146220 5147970 He's being stung<br />by this style.
5148050 5149930 Look at the shots<br />he's taking.
5151640 5153060 I can't believe<br />I'm saying this,
5153140 5155640 but he can't corner the<br />fleet-footed challenger.
5155730 5158060 It's absolutely<br />unbelievable!
5159450 5160960 Come on, is that<br />the hardest you can hit?
5161040 5162500 Bring it to me!<br />Come on! Hit me!
5162590 5165630 NAHAN: That right hand is<br />just like a trip hammer.
5169200 5170740 Rock, tie him up! Bring it to me.<br />Come on.
5171910 5173290 REFEREE: Break it up.<br />Get back. Get back.
5173370 5174660 Come on. Get back.
5174750 5177370 NAHAN: Tough first round.<br />Tough first round.
5177460 5180840 It is Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts, right to the head of Lang.
5180920 5182000 Get off! Get off!
5182090 5183630 Now it's Lang<br />coming back!
5183720 5186300 BALDWIN: This crowd is<br />going absolutely wild!
5190810 5194180 There's a good left-right<br />combination by Rocky.
5194270 5195310 And a good left hand.
5195390 5196390 Go!
5199650 5202480 NAHAN: This is Rocky<br />Balboa's night.
5211330 5212830 BALDWIN: ...getting him<br />back to his corner.
5212910 5215910 We've got pandemonium in the<br />ring at the end of round one.
5216080 5217250 They're holding<br />Lang back.
5217330 5218460 Lang wants more.
5218540 5220710 He can't realize<br />that the round is over.
5220790 5223340 He's trying to<br />get back to Rocky.
5223420 5225300 All right, all right,<br />you look great.
5225380 5226720 Just don't get crazy<br />and we're home.
5227970 5230510 I'll kill you, man!<br />The man's strong.
5230600 5233100 Tell me when's the next round. I'm gonna kill him!<br />I'm gonna kill him!
5233180 5235180 I'm gonna kill him!
5235890 5237560 Now, he's gonna come hard, right?<br />Yeah.
5237640 5239690 TRAINER: You keep crowding him.<br />Don't give him a chance to set.
5239770 5242690 APOLLO: Counter and move. Counter and move.<br />Counter and move.
5242770 5244570 NAHAN: ...and he had<br />Lang at his mercy.
5244650 5248070 BALDWIN: I don't think Lang knew what hit<br />him there in this whole first round.
5248200 5250660 Here we go now.<br />The bell for round two.
5250740 5254830 Now it's Lang coming out for Rocky<br />at the starting of round two.
5256790 5259410 Here he comes back, but Rocky is still<br />landing those rights and lefts.
5259500 5262420 Right now in the center of the<br />ring, a right to the head.
5262500 5264800 Another right to the head.<br />He's really setting him up.
5264880 5266090 A right!<br />Right! Right!
5266170 5267670 Five unanswered shots!
5269010 5270760 Kill him! Kill him!
5275390 5276680 Get out of there!
5276770 5278020 CLUBBER: Get<br />back there!
5282480 5284400 All right! All right!
5285110 5287100 APOLLO: Get him off of him!<br />REFEREE: Let's go now!
5287190 5289440 Come on, break it up!<br />Break it up!
5289530 5290610 What are you doing?
5290700 5292450 Come on!<br />Come on, Balboa!
5292530 5294120 Come on. I'm gonna<br />give it to you!
5294200 5297790 Get those feet moving! Get your hands up!<br />Come on, Rock!
5297870 5299870 That right<br />hand hurt Rocky again.
5299960 5301790 What a fight!
5302380 5305920 BALDWIN: He's got him cornered.<br />Balboa's a little in trouble now.
5310090 5312220 Hold him, damn it!<br />Hold him!
5313680 5315140 Come on, Rocky,<br />come on!
5315220 5316930 BALDWIN: This is<br />Clubber's round so far.
5317020 5318890 Lang's taken<br />momentum here.
5320230 5322390 He's railing away<br />at Balboa.
5323900 5326110 And Balboa is down!
5326190 5328980 You think you're bad? Get up.<br />Get up, damn it!
5329070 5330990 Come on! Come on!<br />Five.
5331070 5332450 BALDWIN: Can he get up?<br />Can he get up?
5332530 5334200 He's in trouble,<br />but he's up.
5334280 5335910 REFEREE: Six. Seven.
5337870 5340160 Here comes Clubber again.<br />Lang with the left hand.
5340250 5342750 Lang with another<br />left and now a right.
5342830 5345080 A right! Another right! A right!<br />Another right!
5345170 5347290 And down goes<br />Balboa again.
5348880 5349960 Stop the fight.
5350050 5351720 CLUBBER: You better<br />stay down.
5352430 5354220 I got some moves<br />if you get up.
5354300 5356510 I got a lot of moves. I got<br />a lot of moves. Come on.
5356600 5359140 BALDWIN: Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
5359220 5361350 Come on,<br />come on, fool.
5364270 5366310 You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't so bad.
5366400 5368360 You ain't so bad.<br />Come on.
5368440 5370320 You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't nothing.
5370400 5371650 CLUBBER: You must be<br />crazy or something!
5371780 5373740 I'm crazy? Yeah, I may be...<br />You're just a stupid fool!
5373820 5375360 ...but I ain't<br />breathing heavy.
5375450 5377870 He's a fool.<br />He's stupid.
5377950 5380140 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
5380230 5382550 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?
5382560 5384810 Look, it's strategy, that's all.<br />I know what I'm doing.
5384810 5386370 No, you don't know<br />what you're doing!
5386370 5388100 He's gotta come to you.<br />You're the champ.
5388100 5390040 He's nothing.<br />He's mine.
5390120 5392340 You stand toe-to-toe with<br />this bum and he'll kill you!
5392340 5394980 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />there and get their head beat off!
5394980 5396960 Don't... He's getting tired.<br />He's getting tired.
5397050 5400180 Don't go wasting your punches.<br />You're the champ.
5400260 5402060 Don't try to take him<br />out with one punch!
5402140 5403230 Use your head.
5403310 5405630 Now, you wear him<br />down. He's all ours.
5405630 5407820 I know what I'm doing, I swear.<br />I know what I'm doing.
5407820 5409490 Don't tell me<br />what you think!
5409490 5410660 Go out there<br />and do it, Rock.
5410690 5412110 Eye of the tiger.<br />You understand?
5412150 5413300 Yeah.
5413390 5414860 Go out there and<br />knock his head off.
5414950 5417070 He's just a man, Rock.<br />He's just a man.
5417950 5419780 Be more man than him!<br />Go get him.
5419870 5421740 Eye of the tiger!<br />Eye of the tiger!
5421910 5423330 DUKE: Up and down.<br />Side to side.
5423330 5425660 BALDWIN: All right, this is<br />the beginning of round three.
5425660 5427830 Tough rounds to<br />call right now.
5427880 5429500 This is a little<br />slower in the start.
5429590 5431840 It's my round.<br />It's my round.
5431920 5433260 I'm gonna take<br />you this time.
5433340 5437050 I'm gonna take you. You're mine.<br />You're mine.
5437180 5440010 Come on. Come on. I'm gonna get you.<br />I'm gonna get you.
5443180 5446310 And Rocky throws him three rights<br />to the head and a left. He is back.
5446390 5449270 He's your heavyweight.
5451980 5454320 Rock, get out<br />of there! Get out!
5456030 5458530 A sharp left-hand<br />right to the head.
5459370 5461280 Get out of there!
5461370 5462660 Come on.
5462740 5464290 Stick him! Stick him!
5467040 5468790 Come on! Come on!
5469420 5470580 Come on!
5470670 5472380 Again, again!
5472590 5474500 He's getting killed.<br />Oh, no, no, no.
5474590 5476410 He's not getting killed,<br />he's getting mad!
5476490 5478300 Come on, whole world's watching.<br />Knock me out.
5478380 5480550 Come on, knock me out.
5480680 5483640 Come on, harder. Hit me hard.<br />Hit me harder. Come on!
5486930 5489020 No!
5490730 5492440 Get out of there!
5494780 5495940 Rocky!
5498740 5500950 Come on, Rock.<br />Hands up, Rock.
5501740 5502720 Yeah.
5503730 5505430 My mother hits harder<br />than that. Come on.
5505430 5507270 A little harder. A<br />little harder, champ.
5507290 5508790 In the face. Come on.
5508870 5510460 Again, come on, champ.
5510540 5513080 Again, come on, champ.<br />You ain't so bad!
5513170 5517090 You ain't nothing!<br />You ain't nothing!
5517970 5520340 Rocky! Rocky!
5535070 5536980 BALDWIN: I might believe<br />the strategy now.
5537070 5540360 He's making Clubber Lang miss now.<br />You see how he drew him in?
5540450 5542280 Now Rocky's<br />throwing the punches!
5545030 5547290 Look at that! He's lifting<br />him right off the canvas
5547370 5550120 with those powerful<br />punches to the ribs.
5554250 5557460 He's coming. He's completely<br />psyched-out this guy.
5558420 5561130 NAHAN: Lang has got to be<br />confused by all of this.
5563220 5566970 Look at the condition Balboa is in right now.<br />Look at the condition.
5567060 5569060 Somehow he's roared back.
5573440 5576610 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
5577230 5579030 PAULIE: Harder punches!<br />Now!
5579110 5581360 What a comeback by Balboa!
5588740 5593290 Come on. Come on.
5594830 5596710 Come on. Come on!
5598630 5599880 Yeah!
5606600 5608680 BALDWIN: The place<br />has gone bananas!
5608760 5610770 It's a tremendous comeback!
5610850 5612140 Get up!
5612230 5615440 Five. Six. Seven.
5615520 5616690 Seven.
5616770 5618940 Eight. Nine.<br />Nine.
5619030 5621690 Ten. You're out!
5623070 5625070 BALDWIN: The new heavyweight<br />champion again!
5625160 5627620 He's down on the<br />floor in ecstasy!
5627990 5630620 Bowing, praying there,<br />beating the floor!
5630700 5634120 And there he is, the new<br />heavyweight champion of the world,
5634210 5636960 Rocky Balboa!
5639340 5641210 Rocky is exhausted!
5643720 5645260 ROCKY: We did it!
5646510 5649890 ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the winner by knockout...
5650220 5651890 Are you all right?
5652060 5654230 Never better.<br />Never better.
5654310 5658480 Once again the heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5658560 5664190 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5672700 5674330 APOLLO: Come on, come on!<br />We made a deal.
5674410 5676220 ROCKY: I know, but this<br />is extremely crazy.
5676230 5677730 Yeah, it's mentally<br />irregular, right?
5677790 5678790 Yeah.
5678790 5680370 But it makes all<br />the sense in the world.
5680370 5681700 You owe me a favor.
5681750 5684590 I know, but when did<br />you think of this?
5684670 5686420 About three years ago.
5686510 5688340 This is very crazy, Apollo.
5688430 5689510 Look, Stallion.
5689600 5692470 Now look, when you won that last<br />fight, you won by one second.
5692560 5694180 You beat me by one<br />second. One second.
5694180 5696390 That's very hard for a man of<br />my intelligence to handle.
5696390 5699850 Is it? But didn't you say after I beat<br />you, you learned how to live with it?
5699900 5701770 I lied.<br />Oh, you lied.
5703110 5705400 So now you just gotta<br />prove it to yourself?
5705490 5706490 Just for myself.
5706570 5708700 No TV, no newspapers,<br />just you and me.
5708780 5710200 Nothing.<br />Just you and me.
5710280 5711660 Age before beauty.
5711740 5712950 Anything you say,<br />Stallion.
5713040 5714700 I'll do all the work,<br />okay.
5715250 5717210 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow
5717290 5719540 because you ain't as young<br />as springtime anymore.
5719630 5722000 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, Stallion.
5722090 5724170 Oh, yeah? Well, how<br />you gonna do that?
5724260 5725800 You taught me<br />everything you know.
5725920 5727470 Almost everything.
5727550 5729510 You gotta remember<br />now, you fight great,
5729590 5732100 but I'm a great fighter.<br />You ready?
5732810 5734060 Absolutely.
5734140 5735310 All right.
5735390 5738850 You know, Stallion, it's too<br />bad we gotta get old, huh?
5740980 5743150 Just keep punching, Apollo.
5744980 5746740 Wanna ring the bell?
5746990 5748320 All right.
5748490 5749950 Ding, ding.
5751660 5753320 Come on, Stallion.
5754240 5756410 Come on. Come on.
5756500 5759580 Boy, you really move<br />good for an older guy.
5760750 5762330 You're looking good,<br />Stallion.
5762420 5763960 I taught you well.
5764040 5766000 I think you<br />taught me too good.
5766090 5768050 Looking fly.<br />Look out now.
5768130 5769760 No, no.<br />You don't want any of this.
5769840 5771510 Come on. Come on.
5772220 5774050 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
5774180 5775720 Come on, watch yourself. Ready?
5777310 5780520 It's the eye of the tiger<br />It's the thrill of the fight

5816640 5820430 So many times,<br />it happens too fast
5820980 5824230 You trade your<br />passion for glory
5825400 5829230 Don't lose your grip<br />on the dreams of the past
5829320 5833450 You must fight<br />just to keep them alive
