1808739 1811527 I'm going on a<br />permanent vacation.
1812443 1814712 What are you talking about?<br />We got one more fight.
1814779 1816814 No, no. Not we, you.
1818649 1820318 Why are you doing this?
1825356 1826824 I said, why are<br />you doing this?
1826892 1829060 Because you can't<br />win, Rock!
1829127 1832397 This guy will kill you to death<br />inside of three rounds!
1832463 1833498 You're crazy.
1833564 1834765 What else is new?
1834832 1836001 He's just<br />another fighter.
1836067 1838103 No, he ain't just<br />another fighter.
1838169 1841772 This guy is a wrecking machine,<br />and he's hungry!
1841839 1844409 Hell, you ain't been<br />hungry since you won that belt!
1844475 1846777 What are you talking<br />about? I've had 10 title defenses.
1846844 1848013 That was easy!
1848079 1849180 What do you<br />mean, easy?
1849247 1851049 They was hand-picked!
1854219 1856888 - Setups?<br />- No, they weren't setups.
1856955 1860758 They was good fighters,<br />but they wasn't killers like this guy.
1860825 1863361 He'll knock you<br />into tomorrow, Rock.
1883181 1884649 Jeez, Mick.
1886985 1888586 Why'd you do it?
1891156 1893624 Because the beating<br />that you got
1893691 1896094 from Apollo should<br />have killed you, kid.
1896161 1897298 It didn't.
1897315 1901532 It was my job to keep you winning<br />and to keep you healthy.
1907338 1909822 You really don't<br />think I got nothing left, do you?
1911309 1915413 Well, Rock,<br />let's put it this way.
1917215 1919871 Three years ago<br />you was supernatural.
1920718 1924222 You was... You was hard<br />and you was nasty
1925069 1927293 and you had<br />this cast-iron jaw.
1928359 1932280 But then the worst<br />thing happened to you
1932897 1934880 that could happen<br />to any fighter.
1935866 1939104 You got civilized. Yeah.
1943641 1945243 Don't worry, kid.
1945810 1950515 You know, presidents retire,<br />generals retire,
1950581 1954752 horses retire,<br />Man o' War retired.
1954819 1956854 They put him<br />out to stud.
1958023 1960725 That's what you<br />should've done, retire.
1964362 1966805 I can't retire<br />knowing all this, Mick.
1967532 1969978 - Don't push it.<br />- Well, you been carrying me.
1970735 1972103 We don't need it.
1972170 1973612 You been carrying<br />me, though.
1974539 1976374 I haven't been<br />carrying you.
1976441 1977675 I've been<br />protecting you.
1977742 1980978 No. Look, I want this fight.<br />Just one more.
1981046 1982280 No, we don't need it.
1982347 1983662 I'll live in the gym.
1984349 1985483 We don't need it.

2280010 2282547 And we welcome you to<br />tonight's heavyweight title fight
2282613 2285115 (CROWD CHANTING) which may prove to be<br />the most memorable of all.
2285182 2286817 For tonight is<br />the champion's final
2286884 2289354 and perhaps most<br />difficult title defense.
2289420 2291589 Rocky, do you feel you're in the best<br />shape of your career?
2291656 2293524 Oh, yeah, absolutely.<br />I feel real good.
2293591 2296361 He's a deadly weapon,<br />he's one of a kind. And he's gonna do it.
2296427 2298162 REPORTER 1: Clubber, do you think<br />you're as fast as Balboa?
2298228 2300030 I don't wanna do no talking.<br />I'll do my talking in the ring.
2300097 2301832 REPORTER 2: Clubber,<br />dance for us.

2319650 2321619 (CHUCKLES)<br />I'm not sure.
2321686 2323588 Maybe join the circus,<br />huh, Mick?
2323654 2325656 Yeah, have some fun.
2325723 2327057 REPORTER 1: Come on,<br />take your robe off.

2332430 2333864 With us this evening is<br />the former
2333931 2335299 heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
2335366 2336634 Apollo Creed.
2336701 2338268 Do you have any<br />predictions on this fight?
2338335 2340304 How do you see this<br />fight going tonight?
2340371 2343207 Well, I feel that strength would have<br />to go to the challenger,
2343273 2345309 while experience and<br />the world's hardest head
2345376 2346744 would have to go<br />to Rocky Balboa.
2346811 2348312 And you know<br />I know about that.
2348379 2351048 Now remember, Rock,<br />don't trade with this guy.
2351115 2353150 Take your time.<br />Wear him down.
2353217 2355219 - But don't stand toe-to-toe with him.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2355285 2358923 This punk's never been<br />15 rounds before.
2358989 2360591 - Take him good.<br />- Okay.
2360658 2361992 - Take him good.<br />- I will.
2362059 2363364 That's it.
2364061 2365800 So I predict that<br />the champ's gonna take this one.
2365856 2368132 Now, wait a minute. Do you really<br />think the champ can hit that hard?

3314644 3316446 Apollo?
3316513 3319483 Right. I waited<br />at your house for about an hour
3319549 3321217 and your wife said<br />you might be here.
3322552 3324187 What are you<br />doing here?
3324253 3325822 Business.
3327391 3329292 If the papers knew<br />we were talking like this,
3329359 3331461 they'd think<br />we was crazy.
3332061 3333530 Why you?
3333597 3335743 Because I'm the best, and you need<br />somebody to teach you different.
3336800 3338968 - Why?<br />- (SCOFFS) Well, to be honest with you,
3339035 3340814 I don't think you could pull<br />it off without me, Rock.
3341371 3344340 You still didn't give me the answer,<br />Apollo. What's the real reason?
3346042 3348311 Listen. It's quiet,<br />isn't it?
3349779 3351615 When you retire,<br />it's too quiet.
3352181 3354244 I mean, we're too<br />young to retire anyway.
3354501 3356820 Besides, with<br />the right touch,
3356886 3359122 I could promote this thing into<br />the biggest gig of all time.
3359188 3360990 It'd be bigger<br />than ours.
3361057 3364741 (CHUCKLES) Heaven knows, I don't mind<br />being involved with large numbers, right?
3366796 3369365 I don't need this<br />no more. I...
3369433 3372235 I don't want<br />this no more.
3372301 3377574 Look, man.<br />When you beat me, I hurt all over
3377641 3381108 and I didn't want to know from nothing<br />or nobody, not even my kids.
3381945 3384047 Hell, every fighter<br />knows that hurt.
3384113 3387283 And we get sick inside trying to live<br />with it, so don't back off now.
3387350 3389600 Make it right for yourself or you'll<br />be sorry you didn't.
3391287 3394691 We held the greatest<br />title in the whole world, babe.
3396693 3399128 You lost that fight,<br />Rock, for all the wrong reasons.
3399195 3401565 You lost your edge.
3401631 3406511 All right, I know your manager dying<br />had you all messed up inside.
3407537 3410907 But the truth is,<br />you didn't look hungry.
3410974 3412577 Now, when we fought,
3413843 3416880 you had that eye of the tiger,<br />man, the edge.
3416946 3418358 And now you<br />gotta get it back.
3418515 3420717 And the way to get it back is to<br />go back to the beginning.
3420784 3423427 (LAUGHS) You know<br />what I mean?
3423953 3425955 Maybe we could win<br />it back together.

3453216 3457186 Clubber, do you accept the<br />challenge for a rematch with Balboa?
3457253 3460624 I reject the challenge,<br />because Balboa is no challenge.
3460690 3463192 But I'd be more than happy to<br />beat up on him some more.
3463259 3465028 I always said<br />he was nothing.
3465094 3466830 I can't wait to<br />see this bum fall.
3466896 3469999 What do you think of him<br />being trained by Apollo Creed?
3470066 3471467 CLUBBER: Apollo who?
3471535 3473603 You talking about<br />that old fool, Apollo Creed?
3473670 3475872 - Shucks, one has-been teaching another.<br />- Yeah, just keep talking, pal.
3475939 3477073 - That's all Apollo been doing...<br />- Keep talking.
3477140 3478708 ...running off at<br />the mouth lately.
3478895 3480944 And when I see him,<br />I'm gonna close it for him.
3481010 3483713 All right. When will<br />the match take place?
3483780 3484948 The sooner,<br />the better.
3485014 3486415 I'm the champion<br />of the world.
3486482 3487951 And nothing can<br />be done about that.
3488017 3490086 I can't be beat,<br />and I won't be beat.
3490153 3491788 This time I'm gonna<br />train even harder.
3491855 3493422 There won't be no<br />quick knockdowns.
3493489 3494824 I'm gonna torture him.
3494891 3497160 I'm gonna crucify<br />him real bad.
3497226 3499462 Hard words<br />from a hard man.
3499529 3503432 The odds against Balboa<br />making a comeback at 34
3503499 3505268 are very long indeed.
3505334 3508538 Can he do it?<br />Most experts doubt it.
3508605 3513843 Balboa was a fine champion,<br />but his time has passed. I wish him luck.
3515111 3516980 Don't listen<br />to it, Rocky.
3517046 3518819 No, do listen<br />to it, Rock.
3519716 3523590 When this is over, a lot of folks<br />are gonna owe you an engraved apology.

3664227 3665549 PAULIE: You know,<br />fun is fun.
3665595 3669232 I like those kind of things, but this<br />I don't like. Look at this place.
3669298 3672769 Rats even have more<br />pride than to be caught dead here.
3673770 3675872 I mean, look<br />at the dump.
3675939 3677273 I just don't like it.

3714043 3715912 That's your problem.
3715979 3718081 Rocko, let's leave<br />before they leave us for dead.
3718147 3719448 (THUDDING)
3721417 3724353 Yeah, you see that look in<br />their eyes, Rock?
3725855 3727456 When we fought, Rock,<br />I trained hard,
3727523 3728691 but I didn't have<br />that look in my eyes.
3728758 3731060 You had it. You won.
3732796 3734328 You gotta get<br />that look back, Rock.

3748878 3750179 It's a free country.
3750256 3752015 Just don't get irregular,<br />all right?
3752081 3754350 I don't need no<br />philosophy lesson here.
3754417 3756485 Well, it just takes<br />about six years to get to know...

3773236 3774938 Good. I know you know who<br />this man is, don't you?
3775004 3776439 Yeah. It's gonna<br />be good working with you.
3776505 3778307 Certainly had enough<br />of working against you.
3778374 3780076 - Hey, how you feel?<br />- Pretty good, thanks.
3780143 3781644 He's doing great.<br />We've been living modern,
3781710 3783446 but now we're<br />gonna train old.

3793957 3796292 You heard.<br />I don't like these people.
3796359 3797793 You don't like them?
3799695 3801921 Maybe they don't<br />like you either, Paulie.
3802598 3803927 What'd I do to them?
3805668 3807430 And they call<br />me punchy.

3840169 3842605 Waste of time.<br />He's got heavy feet.

4260423 4262090 ADRIAN: Can I<br />talk to you?
4266729 4267963 I wanna ask you<br />something important
4268030 4270065 and I want you<br />to tell me the truth.
4270966 4272234 What?
4273268 4274770 Why did you come here?
4276339 4278134 I just don't<br />want it no more.
4279041 4281810 If it's over because<br />you want it to be over, I'm glad.
4283145 4284279 I do.
4285681 4289385 It's just, you've never<br />quit anything since I've known you.
4293656 4295791 I don't know what<br />you want me to say.
4295858 4297960 I mean, how?<br />What happened?
4298026 4300429 How did everything<br />that was so good get so bad?
4302030 4304266 What's so bad?<br />Tell me, what?
4304333 4307503 I wrecked everything<br />by not thinking for myself.
4307570 4309772 I mean, why couldn't Mickey tell<br />me where I was really at,
4309838 4311106 right from the start?
4311173 4312808 He didn't have to<br />carry me and lie to me
4312875 4315844 and make me think I was<br />better than I really was when I wasn't.
4315911 4317312 He never lied.
4317380 4319548 Those fights weren't right.<br />They weren't, Adrian.
4319615 4321517 I never fought anybody<br />who was in their prime.
4321584 4324019 There was always some<br />angle to hold on to the title
4324086 4325854 longer than<br />I should have had it.
4325921 4327856 I mean, do you understand<br />what I'm saying here?
4327923 4330639 I understand. But you've<br />gotta understand that he loved you,
4330666 4332461 and that was his job,<br />protecting you.
4332528 4334530 Well, that protecting<br />don't help nothing.
4334597 4335911 It only makes<br />things worse.
4335979 4339468 You wake up after a few years<br />thinking you're a winner, but you're not.
4339535 4341003 You're really a loser.
4341069 4343939 And so we wouldn't have<br />had the title as long. So what?
4344006 4345808 At least it would've been<br />real, Adrian.
4345874 4347476 It was real.
4347543 4349912 Nothing is real if you don't<br />believe in who you are.
4349978 4352515 I don't believe in myself no<br />more. Don't you understand?
4352581 4353982 When a fighter don't<br />believe, that's it.
4354049 4355918 He's finished.<br />It's over. That's it.
4355984 4357686 - That's not it!<br />- That is it!
4357753 4359187 Why don't you<br />tell me the truth!
4359254 4361390 What are you putting<br />me through, Adrian?
4361457 4362758 You wanna know the truth?
4362825 4364593 The truth is, I don't want to<br />lose what I got.
4364660 4366495 In the beginning, I didn't care about<br />what happened to me.
4366562 4369031 I'd go in a ring, I'd get busted up,<br />I didn't care.
4369097 4370999 But now there's you,<br />there's the kid.
4371066 4372401 I don't wanna<br />lose what I got!
4372468 4375070 What do we have that can't be<br />replaced? What?
4375137 4378206 A house? We got cars.<br />We got money.
4378273 4380308 We got everything<br />but the truth!
4380375 4381944 What's the truth,<br />damn it?
4382010 4384447 I'm afraid, all right?
4384513 4385744 You wanna hear<br />me say it?
4385791 4387656 You wanna break me<br />down? All right, I'm afraid!
4387983 4390018 For the first time in<br />my life, I'm afraid.
4390085 4391554 I'm afraid, too!
4391620 4393021 There's nothing wrong<br />with being afraid.
4393088 4394523 There is.<br />For me there is!
4394590 4396024 Why? You're human,<br />aren't you?
4396091 4398594 Look, I don't know<br />what I am. All I know is I'm a liar,
4398661 4400696 and because of that<br />Mickey ain't here no more.
4400763 4402731 You didn't push<br />him into anything!
4402798 4405468 He was a grown man<br />and he did what he had to do.
4405534 4408431 And you have no right to feel guilty<br />for what happened, you don't!
4409037 4411740 You were a champion. And you did<br />what you were expected to do.
4411807 4414710 You did what I and everybody else<br />thought you should do.
4414777 4417746 And you wanna tell me that those fights<br />weren't real? That you were carried?
4417813 4419181 Well, I don't<br />believe it!
4419247 4420749 But it doesn't matter what<br />I believe.
4420816 4423886 Because you're the one that's gotta<br />carry that fear around inside you.
4423952 4426855 Afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
4426922 4429057 Afraid you're gonna<br />be remembered as a coward,
4429124 4431293 that you're not<br />a man anymore.
4431359 4434630 Well, none of it's true,<br />but it doesn't matter if I tell you.
4434697 4437833 It doesn't matter, because you're<br />the one that's gotta settle it.
4437900 4439067 Get rid of it!
4439134 4441069 Because when all<br />the smoke has cleared
4441136 4443138 and everyone's through<br />chanting your name,
4443205 4445007 it's just gonna be us!
4445073 4446308 And you can't<br />live like this.
4446374 4448310 We can't live like this.
4448376 4450679 Because it's gonna bother you<br />for the rest of your life.
4450746 4452361 Look what it's<br />doing to you now.
4459154 4462458 Apollo thinks you<br />can do it. So do I.
4463225 4465728 But you. You've gotta wanna do<br />it for the right reasons.
4465794 4467395 Not for the guilt<br />over Mickey,
4467462 4470265 not for the people,<br />not for the title,
4470332 4473042 not for money or me,<br />but for you.
4473869 4475871 Just you,<br />just you alone.
4480108 4481304 And if I lose?
4482010 4485681 Then you lose, but at least you lose<br />with no excuses.
4486749 4488081 No fear.
4488617 4491153 And I know you<br />could live with that.
4498894 4500796 How'd you get so tough?
4500863 4502197 (CHUCKLES)
4502931 4504800 I live with a fighter.
4511339 4513008 I really love you.
4520515 4521884 I love you.
4544973 4546942 No, no, no, Rock. No.
4547009 4548410 Just flick it, just flick it.<br />Just flick it.
4555383 4557586 Come on, one more time.<br />Come on!
4560923 4562991 (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
4569164 4570298 Good. Five more laps.
4573636 4575037 Watch it, watch it,<br />watch it, watch it.
4575103 4576739 There you go, come on.
4604199 4605367 (GRUNTING)
4605433 4607369 Jab.
4607435 4609872 (GRUNTING)
4609938 4611606 You got to<br />move it faster.
4617112 4619748 APOLLO: Faster! Faster!<br />Go on. Kick it.
4620548 4621884 (APOLLO LAUGHING)
4622484 4623618 Very nice!
4639567 4640769 Move your head.<br />Move your head.
4640836 4643138 Move it.<br />Move your head.
4643205 4645573 That's right, under!<br />Under and over.
4645640 4648176 Up and down.<br />Turn around.
4648243 4649611 That was nice.
4656819 4659587 Come on, pick them up now.<br />On your toes. On your toes.
4659654 4661289 Come on. Come on.<br />Come on.

4662958 4665560 Faster, faster, faster.<br />Yeah! Good.
4667229 4669031 Ready. Ready.
4670866 4672134 (MEN GRUNTING)
4676104 4677639 Rocky the fish!
4708436 4709571 Yeah!
4725620 4727155 All right!
4734129 4737132 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm<br />Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin
4737199 4739467 and we welcome you<br />to Madison Square Garden,
4739534 4742737 a most exciting backdrop<br />for the anxiously awaited rematch
4742805 4745373 (AUDIENCE CHEERING) between the former<br />champion, Rocky Balboa
4745440 4748010 and the reigning heavyweight<br />champion, Clubber Lang.
4748076 4752180 We now switch to our remote<br />cameras inside the dressing rooms.
4752247 4755150 Would you care to comment on<br />how you plan to fight Balboa?
4755217 4756351 What's your strategy?
4756418 4757633 Don't need any.
4757670 4760923 Balboa's so predictable and stupid,<br />the man comes straight ahead.
4760989 4763792 He's tailor-made for me<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
4763859 4765127 Just make sure you...
4765193 4767316 - That's good.<br />- ...turn them over. Good?
4768463 4771066 How does that<br />look? Okay? Huh?
4771133 4773869 No, I don't hate Balboa,<br />but I pity the fool,
4773936 4777639 and I will destroy any man<br />who tries to take what I got.
4777705 4779007 (AUDIENCE CHEERING)
4781276 4782952 Remember where<br />you came from.
4784279 4786045 Remember what it<br />took to get you here.
4787682 4789918 And you remember what he<br />did to you last time, right?
4790385 4792287 (AUDIENCE CHANTING) - BALDWIN: Since<br />both men are brawlers, Stu,
4792354 4794256 with the edge in power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
4794322 4796391 I would say that<br />the odds are very long
4796458 4798526 against Balboa<br />regaining his title.
4799261 4800709 Now it's your turn.
4801296 4802922 It's your turn, huh?
4804199 4805964 REPORTER: What's your prediction<br />for the fight, then?
4806501 4808436 - Prediction?<br />- Yes, prediction.
4810939 4812201 Pain.
4812908 4815743 Lang is a brawler who<br />likes to hurt a man to the body.
4815810 4819414 And, you know, Balboa may never<br />have psychologically recovered
4819481 4822017 from that vicious knockout<br />that Clubber laid on him.
4823818 4825153 It's time.
4827255 4828590 - Here.<br />- What?
4831860 4833316 I want you to wear these.
4836331 4838233 Come on, Apollo,<br />these are
4838800 4841569 the colors that you<br />wore in our first fight together.
4842704 4843838 I can't wear your colors.
4843906 4845207 Just wear it.
4846508 4848443 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
4849677 4851346 Thanks, Apollo.
4851413 4852948 (CHUCKLES) You just<br />make sure you wash them
4853015 4854382 before you bring<br />them back, all right?
4854449 4856318 Will do, will do.
4857552 4858921 Hey, thanks, Apollo.
4858987 4861890 And remember, after this you<br />owe me a favor.
4863058 4864526 What favor?
4864592 4865808 Bill, I have to agree.
4865834 4869261 Toe-to-toe, Lang is utterly devastating<br />and he's much too strong.
4869797 4871967 (ROCKY BREATHING DEEPLY)
4872034 4874469 All right, listen. I just wanna tell you<br />that I'm proud of you.
4874536 4876104 It takes a hell of a man to change,<br />and you did it.
4876171 4877272 You're gonna prove<br />it to them tonight, right?
4877339 4878506 - Right.<br />- Right.
4878573 4880208 - You did good, Apollo.<br />- Thanks, Paulie.
4880275 4882010 Okay, let's do<br />it, Paulie.
4883979 4886348 NAHAN: And here comes Rocky,<br />and here comes Apollo,
4886414 4888150 the two former champions.
4888216 4890418 BALDWIN: Look at that United States<br />Marine Corps Color Guard there
4890485 4891786 along with the Drum<br />and Bugle Corps.
4891853 4893088 Aren't they magnificent?
4893155 4895023 Tremendous. Take<br />a look at Rocky.
4895090 4898026 Look at the tenseness<br />in his face, the tautness of that body.
4898093 4899461 Boy does he look<br />serious right now!
4899527 4900862 Oh, that he<br />certainly does.
4900929 4902797 And you know, Stu,<br />the word is that
4902864 4905733 this is Rocky's last fight,<br />win, lose or draw.
4905800 4908136 NAHAN: And there he is,<br />the Italian Stallion,
4908203 4910505 Rocky Balboa, climbing into<br />the ring.
4910572 4912540 Boy, he looks incredibly thin,<br />doesn't he?
4912607 4915177 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
4915243 4918013 BALDWIN: Rocky Balboa,<br />the iron man from Philadelphia!
4918080 4921016 And this crowd is certainly with him<br />tonight. Listen.
4921083 4922850 (AUDIENCE CHEERING)
4922917 4925087 Balboa doesn't really<br />have any boxing skill.
4925153 4926588 I've never seen<br />a fighter, though,
4926654 4928290 with as much<br />raw determination.
4928356 4930292 (AUDIENCE BOOING)<br />Hold it, Stu.
4930358 4932827 And here comes<br />the champion now, Clubber Lang.
4932894 4934029 Listen to this crowd.
4936331 4937765 NAHAN: Take a look<br />at those eyes.
4937832 4941497 I've never seen a guy<br />with such sullen eyes. He is tough.
4942104 4944206 Clubber, go back<br />where you came from!
4946441 4949311 BALDWIN: He even belted a spectator<br />on the way in. Did you see that?
4949377 4950512 Look at that man.
4950578 4951646 Boy, awesome.
4951713 4954249 Awesome! Man,<br />he's tough. Look at that.
4954316 4957485 BALDWIN: Clubber Lang,<br />the heavyweight champion of the world.
4957552 4958753 Keep it loose,<br />keep it loose.
4958820 4961023 Hey, fool, you ready<br />for another beating?
4961089 4963325 You should've<br />never came back.
4963391 4965960 Don't look at him.<br />Let's just be cool.
4966028 4967329 Hey, boy.
4968330 4969722 Hey, boy.
4970398 4972334 After I crucify him,<br />you're next.
4972400 4974369 Just stay out of<br />my face, chump.
4974436 4975603 Don't turn your<br />back on me, sucker!
4975670 4977105 NAHAN: We got a brawl<br />before the bell!
4977172 4979107 Apollo and Clubber<br />go at it.
4979174 4981043 (BELL DINGING) This ring is<br />ready to explode.
4981109 4982944 The fight about<br />to officially begin
4983011 4984946 but these guys<br />wanna start now.
4985013 4986748 Come on! Let me go!<br />Let me go!
4986814 4987949 That's right,<br />I'm gonna get you!
4988016 4989117 I'm gonna get you!<br />Let him go!
4989184 4990485 Come on!
4990552 4992387 Let him go! I want him!<br />I want him!
4992454 4994389 - I thought you said be cool.<br />- That was cool.
4994456 4996024 I'm the champ!<br />I'm the champ!
4996091 4997759 I'll beat you<br />like I did last time!
4997825 5000528 You won't have to look to find me.<br />I'm here.

5020615 5023851 from the fighting<br />city of Philadelphia,

5038566 5040435 (GRUNTING)
5040502 5042504 NAHAN: I'll tell you something.<br />He has so slimmed down.
5042570 5043771 He looks like<br />a middleweight.
5043838 5044972 (BELL DINGS)
5045039 5050345 Out of the blue corner,<br />weighing 237 pounds,

5053581 5057885 the reigning heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5057952 5060722 Clubber Lang!
5060788 5061889 (AUDIENCE BOOING)
5061956 5064526 Referee Lou Filippo.
5064592 5066428 Okay, boys,<br />let's go.
5067729 5069531 We went over<br />the rules yesterday.
5069597 5071366 I'm just going to<br />repeat a few of them.
5071433 5074001 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
5074068 5076971 In case of a knockdown,<br />you go to the corner I tell you to
5077038 5079541 and you stay there<br />until I tell you to come out.
5079607 5082130 Is that understood?<br />Any questions?
5082777 5085373 Okay. Let's go back<br />to your corner now. Let's go.
5086080 5087982 I'm gonna bust you up.
5088850 5090185 Go for it.
5092086 5095056 NAHAN: Well, here we go.<br />The war is on.
5095123 5096791 We're just waiting<br />for the bell.
5096858 5098793 Take my belt off.<br />I'm gonna get that chump.

5106301 5107302 (CROWD CHANTING)

5114609 5116077 ANNOUNCER: Are we ready<br />for round one now?
5116144 5117312 NAHAN: Should be<br />a great fight.
5117379 5119347 (BELL DINGS)<br />And here we go.
5119414 5122650 And he goes right out of his corner<br />after Clubber Lang!
5122717 5125320 He's throwing rights and lefts<br />into Clubber's face.
5125387 5126821 What a start<br />of a fight here!
5126888 5129472 BALDWIN: Another jab.<br />Another jab.
5130458 5133228 (EXCLAIMS) And another!<br />This is not the Rocky we expected!
5133295 5134629 He looks fantastic.
5134696 5136498 He's fighting more<br />like Apollo Creed.
5139167 5140702 NAHAN: Another right!
5140768 5143838 A right! Look at that, right and<br />left to the head!
5143905 5146241 BALDWIN: Clubber Lang doesn't know<br />what's happening right now.
5146308 5148075 He's being stung<br />by this style.
5148142 5150011 Look at the shots<br />he's taking.
5150077 5151646 (PEOPLE SHOUTING)
5151713 5153147 I can't believe<br />I'm saying this,
5153215 5155717 but he can't corner<br />the fleet-footed challenger.
5155783 5158119 It's absolutely<br />unbelievable!
5159721 5160955 Come on, is that<br />the hardest you can hit?
5161022 5162490 Bring it to me!<br />Come on! Hit me!
5162557 5165593 NAHAN: That right hand is<br />just like a trip hammer.

5177539 5180908 It is Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts, right to the head of Lang.
5180975 5182109 Get off! Get off!
5182176 5183711 Now it's Lang<br />coming back!
5183778 5186381 BALDWIN: This crowd is<br />going absolutely wild!

5188583 5189617 (CROWD CHEERING)
5190885 5193521 There's a good left-right<br />combination by Rocky.
5194322 5195390 And a good left hand.

5196558 5197992 (MEN SHOUTING)
5199727 5201796 NAHAN: This is Rocky<br />Balboa's night.

5211406 5213007 BALDWIN: ...getting him<br />back to his corner.
5213074 5216077 We've got pandemonium in<br />the ring at the end of round one.
5216143 5217345 (YELLS)<br />-They're holding Lang back.
5217412 5218613 Lang wants more.
5218680 5220815 He can't realize<br />that the round is over.
5220882 5223418 He's trying to<br />get back to Rocky.
5223485 5225387 All right, all right,<br />you look great.
5225453 5226788 Just don't get crazy<br />and we're home.
5226854 5227955 (GRUNTS)
5228022 5230592 - I'll kill you, man!<br />- The man's strong.
5230658 5233194 Tell me when's the next round. I'm<br />gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!
5233261 5234662 I'm gonna kill him!
5235963 5237665 - Now, he's gonna come hard, right?<br />- Yeah.
5237732 5239767 TRAINER: You keep crowding him.<br />Don't give him a chance to set.
5239834 5242770 APOLLO: Counter and move.<br />Counter and move. Counter and move.
5242837 5244772 NAHAN: ...and he had<br />Lang at his mercy.
5244839 5248209 BALDWIN: I don't think Lang knew what hit<br />him there in this whole first round.
5248276 5250745 (BELL DINGS)<br />- Here we go now. The bell for round two.
5250812 5254482 Now it's Lang coming out for Rocky<br />at the starting of round two.
5256851 5259521 Here he comes back, but Rocky<br />is still landing those rights and lefts.
5259587 5262524 Right now in the center of the ring,<br />a right to the head.
5262590 5264892 Another right to the head.<br />He's really setting him up.
5264959 5266160 A right!<br />Right! Right!
5266227 5267729 Five unanswered shots!
5269096 5270832 Kill him! Kill him!
5275470 5276771 Get out of there!
5276838 5278105 CLUBBER: Get<br />back there!
5282544 5283911 All right! All right!
5285680 5286981 - APOLLO: Get him off of him!<br />- REFEREE: Let's go now!
5287048 5288731 Come on, break it up!<br />Break it up!

5294255 5296342 Get those feet moving!<br />Get your hands up! Come on, Rock!
5297959 5299961 (EXCLAIMS) That right<br />hand hurt Rocky again.
5300027 5302364 What a fight!
5302430 5305667 BALDWIN: He's got him cornered.<br />Balboa's a little in trouble now.
5310171 5311506 Hold him, damn it!<br />Hold him!
5313741 5315242 Come on, Rocky,<br />come on!
5315309 5317011 BALDWIN: This is<br />Clubber's round so far.
5317078 5318946 Lang's taken<br />momentum here.
5320314 5322350 He's railing away<br />at Balboa.
5323985 5326187 And Balboa is down!
5326253 5329056 You think you're bad? Get up.<br />Get up, damn it!
5329123 5331092 Come on! Come on!<br />Five.
5331158 5332527 BALDWIN: Can he get up?<br />Can he get up?
5332594 5334295 He's in trouble,<br />but he's up.
5334362 5335963 REFEREE: Six. Seven.
5337932 5340267 Here comes Clubber<br />again. Lang with the left hand.
5340334 5342837 Lang with another<br />left and now a right.
5342904 5345172 A right! Another<br />right! A right! Another right!
5345239 5347375 And down goes<br />Balboa again.
5348943 5350044 Stop the fight.
5350111 5352414 CLUBBER: You better<br />stay down.
5352480 5354315 I got some moves<br />if you get up.
5354382 5356584 I got a lot of moves.<br />I got a lot of moves. Come on.
5356651 5359320 BALDWIN: Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
5359387 5361523 Come on,<br />come on, fool.
5361589 5364291 (MEN GRUNTING)
5364358 5366394 (BELL DINGING)<br />- You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad.
5366461 5368463 You ain't so bad.<br />Come on.
5368530 5370398 You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't nothing.
5370465 5372033 CLUBBER: You must be<br />crazy or something!
5372099 5373835 - I'm crazy? Yeah, I may be...<br />- You're just a stupid fool!
5373901 5375437 ...but I ain't<br />breathing heavy.
5375503 5377972 He's a fool.<br />He's stupid.
5378039 5380341 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
5380408 5382544 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?
5382610 5385089 Look, it's strategy, that's all.<br />I know what I'm doing.
5385116 5386414 No, you don't know<br />what you're doing!
5386481 5388115 He's gotta come to you.<br />You're the champ.
5388182 5390418 He's nothing.<br />He's mine.
5390485 5392420 You stand toe-to-toe with this<br />bum and he'll kill you!
5392487 5394889 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />there and get their head beat off!
5394956 5397058 - Don't...<br />- He's getting tired. He's getting tired.
5397124 5400261 Don't go wasting your punches.<br />You're the champ.
5400327 5402129 Don't try to take<br />him out with one punch!
5402196 5403498 Use your head.
5403565 5405800 Now, you wear him<br />down. He's all ours.
5405867 5407702 I know what I'm doing, I swear.<br />I know what I'm doing.
5407769 5409504 Don't tell me<br />what you think!
5409571 5410705 Go out there<br />and do it, Rock.
5410772 5412173 Eye of the tiger.<br />You understand?
5412239 5413508 (ALARM SOUNDING)<br />- Yeah.
5413575 5414942 Go out there and<br />knock his head off.
5415009 5416978 He's just a man, Rock.<br />He's just a man.
5418012 5419881 Be more man than him!<br />Go get him.
5419947 5421916 Eye of the tiger!<br />Eye of the tiger!
5421983 5423585 (BELL DINGS)<br />- DUKE: Up and down. Side to side.
5423651 5425620 BALDWIN: All right,<br />this is the beginning of round three.
5425687 5427889 Tough rounds to<br />call right now.
5427955 5429591 This is a little<br />slower in the start.
5429657 5431926 It's my round.<br />It's my round.
5431993 5433327 I'm gonna take<br />you this time.
5433394 5437164 I'm gonna take you.<br />You're mine. You're mine.
5437231 5440067 - Come on. Come on.<br />- I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.
5443237 5446407 And Rocky throws him three rights<br />to the head and a left. He is back.
5446474 5448317 He's your heavyweight.
5449644 5451979 (MEN GRUNTING)
5452046 5454381 Rock, get out<br />of there! Get out!
5456083 5458586 A sharp left-hand<br />right to the head.
5459420 5460622 Get out of there!
5461523 5462757 Come on.
5462824 5463958 Stick him! Stick him!
5467261 5468530 Come on! Come on!
5469497 5470665 Come on!
5470732 5472600 Again, again!
5472667 5474602 - He's getting killed.<br />- Oh, no, no, no.
5474669 5476604 He's not getting killed,<br />he's getting mad!
5476671 5478372 Come on, whole world's watching.<br />Knock me out.
5478439 5480675 Come on, knock me out.
5480742 5483511 Come on, harder. Hit me hard.<br />Hit me harder. Come on!
5487014 5488783 No!
5490818 5492386 Get out of there!
5494922 5496090 Rocky!
5498793 5501028 Come on, Rock.<br />Hands up, Rock.
5501796 5503275 Yeah.
5504131 5505700 My mother hits harder<br />than that. Come on.
5505767 5507301 A little harder.<br />A little harder, champ.
5507368 5508870 In the face. Come on.
5508936 5510538 Again, come on, champ.
5510605 5512674 Again, come on, champ.<br />You ain't so bad!
5513240 5516443 You ain't nothing!<br />You ain't nothing!
5518045 5520414 Rocky! Rocky!
5521549 5523284 (CROWD CHEERING)
5535129 5537064 BALDWIN: I might believe<br />the strategy now.
5537131 5540434 He's making Clubber Lang miss now.<br />You see how he drew him in?
5540501 5542369 Now Rocky's<br />throwing the punches!
5542436 5545039 (COMMENTATORS CHATTERING)
5545106 5547374 Look at that!<br />He's lifting him right off the canvas
5547441 5550211 with those powerful<br />punches to the ribs.
5554315 5557439 He's coming.<br />He's completely psyched-out this guy.
5558485 5561222 NAHAN: Lang has got to be<br />confused by all of this.
5563290 5567061 Look at the condition Balboa is in<br />right now. Look at the condition.
5567128 5569130 Somehow he's roared back.
5573534 5576337 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
5577338 5579106 PAULIE: Harder punches!<br />Now!
5579173 5580975 What a comeback by Balboa!
5588816 5590484 Come on. Come on.
5591585 5593354 Come on. Come on.
5595022 5596090 Come on. Come on!
5598826 5600094 Yeah!
5603665 5604899 (CROWD APPLAUDING)
5606668 5608770 BALDWIN: The place<br />has gone bananas!
5608836 5610872 It's a tremendous comeback!
5610938 5612239 Get up!
5612306 5615509 Five. Six. Seven.
5615576 5616778 Seven.
5616844 5619013 - Eight. Nine.<br />- Nine.
5619080 5621415 Ten. You're out!
5623150 5625152 BALDWIN: The new heavyweight<br />champion again!
5625219 5627989 He's down on<br />the floor in ecstasy!
5628055 5630725 Bowing, praying there,<br />beating the floor!
5630792 5634228 And there he is, the new<br />heavyweight champion of the world,
5634295 5636798 Rocky Balboa!
5639400 5641135 Rocky is exhausted!
5643805 5646507 ROCKY: We did it!
5646573 5650344 ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the winner by knockout...
5650411 5652046 Are you all right?
5652113 5654315 Never better.<br />Never better.
5654381 5658552 Once again the heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
5658619 5664258 the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa!
5664892 5666627 (CROWD CHEERING)
5672767 5674435 APOLLO: Come on, come on!<br />We made a deal.
5674501 5676704 ROCKY: I know,<br />but this is extremely crazy.
5676771 5678873 - Yeah, it's mentally irregular, right?<br />- Yeah.
5678940 5680341 But it makes all<br />the sense in the world.
5680407 5681743 You owe me a favor.
5681809 5684678 I know, but when did<br />you think of this?
5684746 5686513 About three years ago.
5686580 5688415 This is very crazy, Apollo.
5688482 5689747 Look, Stallion.
5689804 5692553 Now look, when you won that<br />last fight, you won by one second.
5692619 5694288 You beat me by one<br />second. One second.
5694355 5696357 That's very hard for a man of my<br />intelligence to handle.
5696423 5699894 Is it? But didn't you say after I beat<br />you, you learned how to live with it?
5699961 5701863 - I lied.<br />- Oh, you lied.
5701929 5703564 (BOTH LAUGHING)
5703630 5705499 So now you just gotta<br />prove it to yourself?
5705566 5706700 Just for myself.
5706768 5708803 No TV, no newspapers,<br />just you and me.
5708870 5710304 Nothing.<br />Just you and me.
5710371 5711739 Age before beauty.
5711806 5713040 Anything you say,<br />Stallion.
5713107 5715242 I'll do all the work,<br />okay.
5715309 5717278 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow
5717344 5719646 because you ain't as young<br />as springtime anymore.
5719713 5722083 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, Stallion.
5722149 5724251 Oh, yeah?<br />Well, how you gonna do that?
5724318 5725920 You taught me<br />everything you know.
5725987 5727588 Almost everything.
5727654 5729590 You gotta remember now,<br />you fight great,
5729656 5732159 but I'm a great fighter.<br />You ready?
5732860 5734128 Absolutely.
5734195 5735629 All right.
5735696 5739333 You know, Stallion, it's too bad<br />we gotta get old, huh?
5739400 5741002 (LAUGHING)
5741068 5743204 Just keep punching, Apollo.
5745039 5746173 Wanna ring the bell?
5747074 5748509 All right.
5748575 5750011 Ding, ding.
5751712 5753380 Come on, Stallion.
5754315 5756617 Come on. Come on.
5756683 5759753 Boy, you really move<br />good for an older guy.
5760822 5762423 You're looking good,<br />Stallion.
5762489 5764058 I taught you well.
5764125 5766093 I think you<br />taught me too good.
5766160 5768129 - Looking fly.<br />- Look out now.
5768195 5769831 No, no.<br />You don't want any of this.
5769897 5772233 Come on. Come on.
5772299 5774201 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
