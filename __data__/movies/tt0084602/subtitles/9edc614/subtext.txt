35280 37510 Oh, Rocky, what happened?<br />I'm all right, how's Mick?
37720 39756 He wouldn't go to the hospital<br />till you got here.
39920 41319 Mr. Balboa, time is important.
41480 43436 We must get him<br />to the hospital immediately.
43600 45158 Okay.

86000 87399 Yeah, I knew it.
87600 89716 That's good. We did it, huh?
89920 92388 We did it. We did it.<br />All right.
92560 94437 You don't have to worry<br />about nothing no more.
94600 96750 No. Good.<br />Everything's gonna be okay, Mick.
97480 99357 You know?<br />I knew that we did it.
99560 101994 You gotta get to the hospital.
102160 103878 You're not as young<br />as you used to be.
104080 105399 You're the winner.
106600 109114 We did everything right.<br />I did everything...
109320 111914 No, no, listen.<br />We ain't done everything right.

404080 405991 MAN:<br />That's not the way to do it.
406480 407799 Who's that?
409080 411753 Why don't you hit it straight?<br />Step into it.
414240 415389 Apollo?
415920 418753 Right. I waited at your house<br />for about an hour.
418960 420518 Your wife said you might be here.
421600 422953 What are you doing here?
423520 424748 Business.
426520 430593 If the papers knew<br />we were talking like this,<br />they'd think we was crazy.
430800 431949 Why you?
432160 435118 Because I'm the best, and you need<br />somebody to teach you different.
435320 436719 Why?
436880 439440 Well, to be honest with you,<br />I don't think you could pull it off<br />without me.
439600 441192 You still didn't give me<br />the answer, Apollo.
441400 442799 What's the real reason?
444120 446839 Listen. It's quiet, isn't it?
447800 449518 When you retire, it's too quiet.
450160 452151 I mean, we're too young<br />to retire anyway.
452360 456672 Besides, with the right touch,<br />I could promote this thing into<br />the biggest gate of all time.
456880 458154 It'd be bigger than ours.
458560 462792 Heaven knows I don't mind being<br />involved with large numbers, right?
464120 466509 I don't need this no more. I...
466720 468597 I don't want this no more.
469400 470594 Look, man.
470960 474430 When you beat me, I hurt all over.
474640 477871 I didn't want to know from nothing<br />or nobody, not even my kids.
478640 480517 Hell, every fighter knows that hurt.
480720 483598 And we get sick inside trying to live<br />with it, so don't back off now.
483800 486792 Make it right for yourself<br />or you'll be sorry you didn't.
487720 491474 We held the greatest title<br />in the whole world, babe.
492720 494950 You lost that fight, Rock,<br />for all the wrong reasons.
495120 496838 You lost your edge.
497600 500876 All right,<br />I know your manager dying
501080 502593 had you all messed up inside.
503240 506152 But the truth is,<br />you didn't look hungry.
506520 508078 Now, when we fought...
509320 511959 you had that eye of the tiger, man,<br />the edge.
512240 513468 And now you gotta get it back.
513640 515710 And the way to get it back<br />is to go to the beginning.
515880 517108 You know what I mean?
517600 518828 [CHUCKLES]
519000 521389 Maybe we could win it back together.
523200 525191 Eye of the tiger, man.
528480 530471 Why'd you have to come here?
531600 534353 I have the plan. Get back, man.
536640 538631 You got me curious.
540440 542317 You got me curious, Rock.
546960 550635 <i>Clubber, do you accept the challenge</i><br /><i>for a rematch with Balboa?</i>
550800 553951 <i>I reject the challenge,</i><br /><i>because Balboa is no challenge.</i>
554160 556435 <i>But I'd be more than happy</i><br /><i>to beat up on him some more.</i>
556640 558153 <i>I always said he was nothing.</i>
558320 559912 I can't wait to see this bum fall.
560120 562918 <i>What do you think of him</i><br /><i>being trained by Apollo Creed?</i>
563120 564235 <i>Apollo who?</i>
564400 566436 <i>You talking about that old fool,</i><br /><i>Apollo Creed?</i>
566640 568835 <i>One has-been teaching another.</i><br />Yeah, just keep talking, pal.
569000 570558 <i>Apollo only running his mouth.</i><br />Keep talking.
571360 573476 <i>And when I see him,</i><br /><i>I'm gonna close it for him.</i>
573640 576200 <i>All right.</i><br /><i>When will the match take place?</i>
576360 578555 <i>The sooner, the better.</i><br /><i>I'm the champion of the world.</i>
578760 582196 <i>And nothing can be done about that.</i><br /><i>I can't be beat, and I won't be beat.</i>
582400 584072 <i>This time I'm gonna train</i><br /><i>even harder.</i>
584240 586708 <i>There won't be no quick knockdowns.</i><br /><i>I'll torture him.</i>
586920 589150 <i>I'm gonna crucify him real bad.</i>
589360 591157 <i>Hard words from a hard man.</i>
591360 595114 <i>The odds against Balboa making</i><br /><i>a comeback at 34</i>
595280 596872 <i>are very long indeed.</i>
597080 599992 <i>Can he do it? Most experts doubt it.</i>
600200 603988 <i>Balboa was a fine champion,</i><br /><i>but his time has passed.</i>
604200 605269 <i>I wish him luck.</i>
606480 608072 Don't listen to it, Rocky.
608280 610635 No, do listen to it, Rock.
610840 614992 When this is over, a lot of folks are<br />gonna owe you an engraved apology.
616720 618312 And you're gonna owe me<br />a big favor.

1165520 1167476 There is no tomorrow!
1168080 1170310 <i>There is no tomorrow!</i>
1175600 1178558 Look, there's just one thing<br />that you gotta remember.<br />We gotta get some speed.
1178760 1181354 You gotta get some flexibility.<br />You gotta get some quickness.
1181520 1184273 You understand?<br />Quickness, endurance,<br />that's the end of it.
1184480 1186596 That's the only thing we gotta<br />concern ourselves with, Rock.
1186760 1188990 All right.<br />Mickey never had me do this.
1190320 1191833 Yeah.
1192000 1193319 Okay, here we go.
1194400 1195435 Ready?
1199520 1200509 Set.<br />Yeah.
1200680 1201669 Go!
1202160 1206199 Come on, come on! Dig, dig, dig!
1213880 1214869 Come on!
1216680 1217874 MICK:<br /><i>You can't win, Rock.</i>
1220240 1222470 <i>You ain't been hungry</i><br /><i>since you won that belt.</i>
1224240 1226356 <i>He'll knock you into tomorrow.</i>
1229080 1234712 [ROCKY CRYING AND SCREAMING]
1268560 1269879 What's the matter?
1271320 1272514 It's over.
1273160 1274388 It's all over.
1285040 1286758 What's the matter with you?!
1289760 1293833 [###]
1321360 1322679 ADRIAN:<br />Can I talk to you?
1327360 1330318 I wanna ask you something important<br />and I want you to tell me the truth.
1331240 1332229 What?
1333480 1334959 Why did you come here?
1336440 1338192 I just don't want it no more.
1339080 1341799 If it's over because<br />you want it to be over, I'm glad.
1342960 1344109 I do.
1345400 1349279 It's just, you've never quit anything<br />since I've known you.
1353080 1354877 I don't know what<br />you want me to say.
1355160 1357151 I mean, how..? What happened?
1357360 1359635 How did everything that was so good<br />get so bad?
1361200 1363077 What's so bad? Tell me, what?
1363280 1366192 I wrecked everything<br />by not thinking for myself.
1366400 1369597 I mean, why couldn't Mickey tell me<br />where I was really at from the start?
1369800 1372030 He didn't have to carry me<br />and lie to me and make me think
1372200 1374077 I was better than I really was<br />when I wasn't.
1374240 1375468 He never lied.
1375680 1377750 Those fights weren't right.<br />They weren't, Adrian.
1377960 1379712 I never fought anybody<br />that was in their prime.
1379920 1383754 There was always an angle<br />to hold on to the title longer<br />than I should have had it.
1383960 1385678 I mean, do you understand<br />what I'm saying here?
1385840 1390516 I understand. But you've gotta<br />understand that he loved you,<br />and protecting you was his job.
1390720 1393473 Protecting don't help nothing.<br />It only makes things worse.
1393680 1396831 You wake up after a few years<br />thinking you're a winner,<br />but you're not.
1397040 1401272 You're really a loser.<br />And so we wouldn't have had<br />the title as long. So what?
1401480 1403118 At least it would've been real.
1403280 1404269 It was real!
1404480 1406994 Nothing is real if you don't<br />believe in who you are!
1407200 1409475 I don't believe in myself no more.<br />Don't you understand?
1409680 1412717 When a fighter don't believe,<br />that's it! He's finished! It's over.
1412920 1414353 That's not it!<br />That is it!
1414560 1415754 Why don't you tell me the truth!
1415920 1417831 What are you putting me through?!
1418000 1418989 You wanna know the truth?
1419160 1421151 The truth is,<br />I don't want to lose what I got.
1421360 1423555 In the beginning,<br />I didn't care what happened to me.
1423760 1427070 I'd get busted up, I didn't care.<br />But now there's you, there's the kid.
1427280 1428474 I don't wanna lose what I got!
1428640 1430995 What do we have<br />that can't be replaced?
1431200 1434033 A house? We got cars. We got money.
1434240 1436071 We got everything but the truth!
1436240 1437673 What's the truth, damn it?
1437920 1441196 I'm afraid, all right?<br />You wanna hear me say it?
1441360 1443237 You wanna break me down?!<br />All right, I'm afraid!
1443400 1445277 For the first time in my life,<br />I'm afraid.
1445480 1448313 I'm afraid too! There's nothing wrong<br />with being afraid.
1448520 1451239 There is. For me there is!<br />Why? You're human, aren't you?
1451440 1453670 Look, I don't know what I am.<br />All I know is I'm a liar,
1453840 1455592 and because of that<br />Mickey ain't here no more.
1455760 1457557 You didn't push him into anything!
1457760 1460274 He was a grown man and he did<br />what he had to do.
1460480 1462914 You have no right to feel guilty<br />for what happened, you don't!
1463680 1466274 You were a champion. And you did<br />what you were expected to do.
1466480 1468948 You did what I and everybody else<br />thought you should do.
1469160 1471913 You wanna tell me that those fights<br />weren't real? That you were carried?
1472080 1473069 Well, I don't believe it!
1473560 1474913 But it doesn't matter what I believe.
1475120 1477839 You're the one that's gotta carry<br />that fear around inside you.
1478080 1480753 Afraid that everybody's<br />gonna take things away.
1480960 1482996 Afraid you're gonna be remembered<br />as a coward,
1483160 1484912 that you're not a man anymore.
1485120 1488271 Well, none of it's true, but it<br />doesn't matter if I tell you.
1488480 1491233 It doesn't matter,<br />because you're the one<br />that's gotta settle it.
1491400 1492389 Get rid of it!
1492560 1494516 Because when all the smoke<br />has cleared
1494720 1496358 and everyone's through<br />chanting your name
1496560 1498039 it's just gonna be us!
1498200 1501272 And you can't live like this.<br />We can't live like this.
1501480 1503277 Because it's gonna bother you<br />for the rest of your life.
1503440 1505590 Look what it's doing to you now.
1511720 1515315 Apollo thinks you can do it.<br />So do I.
1515680 1518069 But you. You've gotta wanna do it<br />for the right reasons.
1518280 1522319 Not for the guilt over Mickey,<br />not for the people, not for the title,
1522520 1525432 not for money or me, but for you.
1526000 1528116 Just you, just you alone.
1531760 1533478 And if I lose?
1533680 1537798 Then you lose, but at least<br />you lose with no excuses.
1538200 1539713 No fear.
1539960 1541996 And I know you could live with that.
1543280 1546989 [###]
1549920 1551672 How'd you get so tough?
1551840 1553512 [LAUGHS]
1553680 1555432 I live with a fighter.
1561880 1563472 I really love you.

1775680 1778240 STU:<br /><i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i><br /><i>I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin</i>
1778440 1781000 <i>and we welcome you</i><br /><i>to Madison Square Garden</i>
1781200 1783760 a most exciting backdrop<br />for the anxiously awaited rematch
1783960 1786110 between the former champion,<br />Rocky Balboa
1786320 1788675 and the reigning heavyweight champ,<br />Clubber Lang.
1788880 1792839 We now switch to our remote cameras<br />inside the dressing rooms.
1793040 1796555 Would you care to comment<br />on how you plan to fight Balboa?<br />What's your strategy?
1796720 1797709 Don't need any.
1797920 1801037 Balboa's so predictable and stupid,<br />the man comes straight ahead.
1801240 1803754 He's tailor-made for me<br />and he's gonna get hurt.
1803960 1804949 Make sure...
1805120 1807759 That's good.<br />Turn them over. Good?
1808440 1810078 How does that look? Okay?
1811000 1813468 No, I don't hate Balboa,<br />but I pity the fool,
1813680 1817309 and I will destroy any man<br />who tries to take what I got.
1820680 1822557 Remember where you came from.
1823560 1825551 Remember what it took<br />to get you here.
1826880 1829394 Remember what he did to you<br />last time, right?
1829640 1833030 Since both men are brawlers,<br />with the edge in power<br />going to Clubber Lang,
1833240 1837279 I would say that the odds<br />are very long against<br />Balboa regaining his title.
1837920 1839319 Now it's your turn.
1839880 1841438 It's your turn, huh?
1842800 1845394 What's your prediction for the fight?<br />Prediction?
1845600 1847272 Yes, prediction.
1849080 1850479 Pain.
1851080 1853594 Lang is a brawler who likes<br />to hurt a man to the body.
1853800 1857110 And, you know, Balboa may never<br />have psychologically recovered
1857320 1859788 from that vicious knockout<br />that Clubber laid on him.
1861520 1862635 It's time.
1864760 1866478 Here.<br />What?
1869480 1870993 I want you to wear these.
1873400 1875755 Come on, Apollo, these are...
1875920 1878912 the colors that you wore<br />in our first fight together.
1879600 1881989 I can't wear your colors.<br />Just wear it.
1883240 1885435 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
1886280 1887759 Thanks, Apollo.
1887920 1890673 You just make sure you wash them<br />before you bring them back, all right?
1890880 1892871 Will do, will do.
1893720 1894994 Hey, thanks, Apollo.
1895200 1898272 And remember, after this<br />you owe me a favor.
1899120 1900553 What favor?
1900720 1901709 I have to agree.
1901880 1905156 Toe-to-toe, Lang is utterly devastating<br />and he's much too strong.
1907840 1910149 All right, listen. I just wanna tell you<br />that I'm proud of you.
1910320 1912834 It takes a hell of man to change,<br />and you did. Prove it tonight, right?
1913000 1913989 Right.<br />Right.
1914160 1917357 You did good, Apollo.<br />Thanks, Paulie. Okay, let's do it.
1919240 1923233 STU: And here comes Rocky,<br />and here comes Apollo,<br />the two former champions.
1923440 1926671 BILL: Look at that United States<br />Marine Corps Color Guard and Drum<br />and Bugle Corps.
1926840 1929752 Aren't they magnificent?<br />Tremendous. Take a look at Rocky.
1929960 1932599 Look at the tenseness in his face,<br />the tautness of that body.
1932800 1935394 Boy does he look serious right now!<br />Oh, that he certainly does.
1935600 1940071 And you know, Stu, the word is<br />that this is Rocky's last fight,<br />win, lose or draw.
1940240 1944597 And there he is, the Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring.
1944800 1946279 Boy, he looks incredibly thin,<br />doesn't he?
1946640 1949108 I'd say he's gotta be<br />about 20 pounds lighter.
1949320 1951880 Rocky Balboa, the iron man<br />from Philadelphia!
1952080 1954514 This crowd is certainly<br />with him tonight. Listen.
1954680 1956557 [CHEERING]
1956720 1958995 Balboa doesn't have any boxing skill.
1959200 1961077 I've never seen a fighter, though,<br />with as much raw determination.
1961240 1962229 [BOOING]
1962400 1963628 Hold it, Stu. Look behind me.
1963840 1967276 And here comes the champion now,<br />Clubber Lang. Listen to this crowd.
1969440 1973115 Take a look at those eyes.<br />I've never seen a guy<br />with such sullen eyes.
1973320 1974389 He is tough.
1974840 1976717 Clubber, go back<br />where you came from!
1979280 1981874 Oh, he even belted a spectator<br />on the way in. Did you see that?
1982080 1984036 Look at that man.<br />Boy, awesome.
1984240 1986470 Awesome! He's tough. Look at that.

1989640 1990789 Keep it loose, keep it loose.
1990960 1993076 Hey, fool,<br />you ready for another beating?
1993280 1995236 You should've never came back.
1995520 1996509 Don't look at him.
1996680 1997669 Let's just be cool.

2095280 2096633 We went over the rules yesterday.
2096840 2098751 I'm just going to repeat<br />a few of them.
2098960 2101315 Let's watch the low blows<br />and the rabbit punches.
2101520 2104080 In case of a knockdown,<br />you go to the corner I tell you to
2104240 2106754 and you stay there<br />until I tell you to come out.
2106960 2109633 Is that understood? Any questions?

2165640 2168313 A right! Look at that,<br />right to left to the head!
2168520 2170636 Clubber Lang doesn't know<br />what's happening right now.
2170800 2174509 He's being stung by this style.<br />Look at the shots he's taking.
2174720 2176119 [GRUNTING]
2176280 2179795 STU: I can't believe I'm saying this,<br />but he can't corner<br />the fleet-footed challenger.
2180000 2182195 It's absolutely unbelievable!
2183920 2186559 Come on, is that the hardest you hit?<br />Bring it to me! Come on! Hit me!
2186760 2189274 That right hand<br />is just like a trip hammer.
2192960 2194951 Rock, tie him up!<br />Bring it to me.
2195120 2197839 Break it up. Get back.<br />Get back. Come on.
2198000 2200719 STU:<br />Tough first round! Tough first round.
2200920 2203514 Rocky with a couple of rights<br />and lefts to the head.
2203720 2206439 Get off!<br />Now it's Lang coming back!
2206640 2209234 BILL:<br />This crowd is going absolutely wild!
2209440 2210668 [YELLING]
2213360 2216238 There's a good left-right combination<br />by Rocky.
2216960 2218552 And a good left hand.<br />Go!
2222320 2224788 This is Rocky Balboa's night!
2229520 2230953 [BELL RINGING]
2232400 2234436 STU:<br />- getting him back to his corner.
2234640 2236870 We've got pandemonium in the ring<br />at the end of round one.
2237080 2238798 Ah!<br />They're holding Lang back.
2239040 2242749 Lang wants more.<br />He can't realize the round is over.
2242960 2244757 He's trying get back to Rocky.
2244960 2246518 All right, you look great.
2246720 2248153 Just don't get crazy<br />and we're home.
2249200 2250235 I'll kill you, man!
2250600 2251794 The man's strong.
2252000 2255037 Tell me when's the next round.<br />I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!
2256840 2258398 Now, he's gonna come hard, right?<br />Yeah.
2258880 2260552 Keep crowding him.<br />Don't give him a chance to set.
2260720 2263598 Counter and move.<br />Counter and move.
2263760 2265159 STU:<br />He had Lang at his mercy.
2265360 2268397 BILL:<br />I don't think Lang knew<br />what hit him in the first round.
2268880 2271189 STU:<br />Here we go. The bell for round two.
2271400 2273595 BILL:<br />Now it's Lang coming out for Rocky.
2275640 2279189 Here he comes back, but Rocky's<br />still landing those rights and lefts.
2279880 2282269 Right now in the center of the ring,<br />a right to the head.
2282480 2285552 Another right to the head.<br />He's really setting him up.<br />Right! Right! Right!
2285760 2287876 Five unanswered shots!
2288480 2289469 Kill him! Kill him!
2291360 2292554 Ah!

2311280 2312838 Come on. I'm gonna give it to you!
2313040 2315076 Get your hands up! Come on, Rock!
2316240 2319755 Ooh, that right hand hurt Rocky again.<br />What a fight!
2320520 2322988 He's got him cornered.<br />Balboa's in trouble.
2324760 2326796 [GRUNTING FIERCELY]
2327920 2329239 Hold him, damn it!
2331520 2332794 Come on, Rocky, come on!
2333000 2336231 This is Clubber's round so far.<br />Lang's taken momentum here.
2336400 2339597 He's railing away at Balboa.
2341360 2344352 And Balboa is down!<br />CLUBBER: Think you're bad? Get up.
2344560 2345629 Get up, damn it!
2346120 2347553 Come on! Come on!
2347760 2349637 Five.<br />STU: Can he get up?
2349840 2351751 Six.<br />He's in trouble, but he's up.
2354600 2357239 Here comes Clubber again.<br />Lang with the left hand.
2357440 2358919 Another left and a right.
2359520 2361351 A right! Another right!
2361520 2363954 And down goes Balboa again.
2365080 2366513 Stop the fight.
2368880 2370029 I got some moves.
2370360 2372476 I got a lot of moves. Come on.
2372680 2374033 Here we go again.<br />Clubber coming into him.
2379960 2382633 You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad.<br />You ain't so bad.
2382800 2383789 [BELL RINGING]
2383960 2385518 You ain't so bad. You ain't nothing.
2385680 2386954 CLUBBER:<br />You must be crazy or something!
2387120 2389111 I'm crazy?<br />You're a stupid fool!
2389320 2392790 I ain't breathing heavy.<br />He's a fool. He's stupid.
2393000 2395116 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
2395280 2397271 What the hell are you doing?<br />What the hell are you doing?!
2397480 2399710 Look, it's strategy, that's all.<br />I know what I'm doing.
2399920 2401114 No, you don't know<br />what you're doing!
2401320 2402719 He's gotta come to you.<br />You're the champ.
2402920 2404797 He's nothing. He's mine.
2405000 2406797 Stand toe-to-toe with this bum<br />and he'll kill you!
2406960 2409110 It doesn't take a man to stand<br />and get their head beat off!
2409320 2411038 Don't...<br />He's getting tired. He's getting tired.
2411760 2414558 Don't go wasting your punches.<br />You're the champ.
2414760 2416990 Don't try to take him out<br />with one punch! Use your head.
2417360 2419351 Now, you wear him down.<br />He's all ours.
2419760 2421432 I know what I'm doing, I swear.
2421640 2423119 Don't tell me what you think!
2423280 2426477 Go out there and do it, Rock.<br />Eye of the tiger. You understand?
2427400 2430472 Go out there and knock his head off.<br />He's just a man.

2437200 2438792 BILL:<br />All right, this is the beginning<br />of round three.
2438960 2442236 Tough rounds to call right now.<br />This is a little slower in the start.
2442400 2444356 It's my round. It's my round.

2530760 2533479 [GRUNTING]
2543440 2547319 STU:<br />I might believe the strategy now.<br />He's making Clubber Lang miss now.
2547520 2551672 You see how he drew him in?<br />Now Rocky's throwing the punches!
2553800 2558032 He's lifting him right off the canvas<br />with those punches to the ribs.
2562160 2565470 He's coming.<br />He's completely psyched-out this guy.
2566240 2569471 Lang has got to be confused<br />by all of this.
2570280 2574478 Look at the condition Balboa is in<br />right now. Look at the condition.
2574640 2577916 Somehow he's roared back.
2580720 2583553 And Lang doesn't know<br />how to defend himself.
2584200 2585838 Harder punches!<br />Now!
2586000 2587877 What a comeback by Balboa!
2595160 2596832 Come on. Come on.

2675720 2677278 APOLLO:<br />Come on, come on! We made a deal.
2677480 2679277 ROCKY:<br />I know, but this is extremely crazy.
2679440 2681351 Yeah, it's mentally irregular, right?<br />Yeah.
2681560 2684199 But it makes all the sense<br />in the world. You owe me a favor.
2684400 2687039 I know, but when did you<br />think of this?
2687240 2688673 About three years ago.
2688880 2691633 Oh, this is very crazy, Apollo.<br />Look, Stallion.
2691840 2694479 When you won that last fight,<br />you won by one second.
2694680 2695715 You beat me by one second.
2695880 2698110 One second. That's very hard for<br />a man of my intelligence to handle.
2698320 2701596 Oh, is it? But didn't you say<br />you learned how to live with it?
2701800 2704598 I lied.<br />Oh, you lied.
2704800 2706870 Oh, so now you just gotta prove it<br />to yourself?
2707080 2710117 Just for myself.<br />No TV, no newspapers,<br />just you and me.
2710320 2712959 Nothing. Just you and me.<br />Uh, age before beauty.
2713160 2716311 Anything you say, Stallion.<br />I'll do all the work.
2716520 2718158 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow
2718360 2720430 because you ain't as young<br />as springtime anymore.
2720640 2722995 I'm still young enough<br />to whip your butt, Stallion.
2723200 2724952 Oh, yeah?<br />How you gonna do that?
2725120 2726439 You taught me everything you know.
2726640 2729200 Almost everything.<br />You gotta remember now
2729400 2732756 you fight great,<br />but I'm a great fighter. You ready?
2733320 2734309 Oh, absolutely.
2734480 2735515 All right.
2735720 2739998 You know, Stallion, it's too bad<br />we gotta get old, huh?
2740880 2743030 Ah, just keep punching, Apollo.
2744960 2746154 Wanna ring the bell?
2746920 2748069 All right.
2748240 2750629 Ding, ding.
2751320 2752799 Come on, Stallion.
2753840 2755478 Come on. Come on.
2756080 2759072 Boy, you really move good<br />for an older guy.
2760080 2762594 Oh, you're looking good, Stallion.<br />I taught you well.
2763200 2765156 I think you taught me too good.
2765360 2766998 Looking fly.<br />Look out now.
2767200 2769555 No, no.<br />You don't want any of this. Come on.
2769760 2770875 Come on.
2771040 2772837 Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.
2773040 2775110 Come on, watch yourself.<br />Ready?
