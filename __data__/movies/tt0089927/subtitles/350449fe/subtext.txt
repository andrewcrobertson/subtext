824200 826236 I know you're kind<br />of busy just now,

832800 837430 You kept me around when<br />others would have dropped me.<br />You give me respect.
837640 841758 It's hard for me to say<br />these things, because that<br />ain't my way.

1951120 1953156 I came here tonight
1953400 1955356 and I didn't know what to expect.
1955560 1957755 [INTERVIEWER TRANSLATING<br />IN RUSSIAN]
1957920 1961117 I seen a lot of people hating me
1961360 1965273 and I didn't know<br />what to feel about that,
1965480 1969632 so I guess I didn't like you<br />much none either.
1974400 1977119 During this fight,
1977680 1979238 I seen a lot of changing.
1983120 1986237 The way youse felt about me
1986680 1989911 and the way I felt about you.
1993160 1996789 In here there were<br />two guys
1997600 1999352 killing each other.
1999600 2003798 But I guess that's better<br />than 20 million.
2007280 2009589 But what I was trying<br />to say is...
2011840 2013751 that if I can change,
2015840 2017796 then you can change.
2020000 2021956 Everybody can change!
2040320 2043392 I just want to say one thing<br />to my kid,
