41542 42710 Man, get up.
42793 44086 Get up!
131256 132967 That's not the way to do it.
137012 138222 Apollo?
138806 139848 Right.
140933 142393 What are you doing here?
142476 143727 Business.
145813 147856 If the papers knew<br />we were talking like this,
147940 149566 they'd think we was crazy.
150567 151860 Why you?
151944 154488 I'm the best, and you need somebody<br />to teach you different.
155614 157533 I don't need this no more. I...
158325 159994 I don't want this no more.
161078 162371 Look, man.
162454 164206 When you beat me,
165541 166542 I hurt all over.
166625 169920 I didn't wanna know from nothing<br />or nobody, not even my kids.
170546 172715 Hell, every fighter knows that hurt,
172798 176218 and we get sick inside trying to live with it,<br />so don't back off now.
176301 178679 Make it right for yourself<br />or you'll be sorry you didn't.
179304 180889 Now, when we fought...
182516 185310 you had the eye of the tiger, man. The edge!
185394 187021 And now you gotta get it back,
187104 189523 and the way to get it back<br />is to go back to the beginning.
189606 190691 You know what I mean?
192609 194737 Maybe we can win it back together.
196947 198741 Eye of the tiger, man.
199366 200617 Rocky! Rocky!
201326 202536 Get it back, man.
202619 204580 Rocky! Rocky!
204663 207499 Come on! Come on, Balboa. Come on!
207583 210419 Come on, get those feet moving.<br />Get your hands up. Come on, Rock!
212421 213839 That right hand hurt Rocky again!
213922 216467 A right! Another right! A right! Another right!
216550 218844 And down goes Balboa again.
218927 220095 Four.
220179 221221 Stop the fight.
221305 223640 - You better stay down.<br />- Six.
223724 225434 I got some more for you, so get up.
225517 227978 I got a lot of moves.<br />I got a lot of moves. Come on.
228062 230230 Here we go again. Clubber coming in.
233358 235069 You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad.
235152 237362 You ain't so bad. Come on.
237446 239281 You ain't so bad. You ain't nothing!
239364 241366 - You must be crazy!<br />- I'm crazy?
241450 242910 - You're a fool!<br />- Yeah, I may be,
242993 244453 but I ain't breathing heavy.
244536 246121 He's a fool. He's stupid.
246830 249166 How could he come back<br />from a beating like that?
249249 251543 Hey, what the hell?<br />What the hell are you doing?
251627 253879 - I know what I'm doing.<br />- No, you don't.
253962 255798 He's gotta come to you. You're the champ.
255881 257716 He's nothing. He's mine.
257800 259718 - Don't...<br />- He's getting tired.
260552 262096 Don't go wasting your punches.
262179 264264 I know what I'm doing, I swear. I know.
264348 266475 Go do it, Rock. Eye of the tiger.
266558 267935 - You understand?<br />- Yeah.
268477 270062 Go out there and knock his head off.
270145 272022 He's just a man, Rock. He's just a man.
272940 274441 Be more man than him!
274525 276860 Go get him. Eye of the tiger! Eye of the tiger!
278487 280697 All right, this is the beginning of round three.
280781 282950 Tough rounds to call right now.
283992 286453 - You're mine. You're mine.<br />- Come on.
286995 290582 There's the first shot. Rocky comes with<br />three rights to the head and a left.
290666 292709 He is back. He's your heavyweight.
292793 294586 - That's right.<br />- Lang can't keep throwing...
295212 296380 Stick him!
299550 300801 Get in there!
302177 303262 Come on! Come on!
303887 305013 He's getting killed.
305097 307766 No, no, no. He's not getting killed,<br />he's getting mad!
309268 310644 My mother hits harder.
310727 312980 Come on. A little harder, champ.<br />In the face. Come on.
314815 316650 Again, champ. You ain't so bad!
316733 317860 You ain't nothing.
319486 320529 Rocky!
320612 323532 Rocky! Rocky!
328912 330330 You see how he drew him in?
330414 333542 Now Rocky's throwing the punches.<br />Look at the punches.
353437 354521 Now!
356148 359401 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
360277 362571 Come on. Come on. Come on!
363530 364448 Come on.
365282 366742 Rocky! Rocky!
366825 368160 Come on. Come on!
377461 379171 - Yeah!<br />- You're out!
382758 384384 Yeah!
388597 389848 There he is,
389932 395062 the new heavyweight champion<br />of the world, Rocky Balboa!
395604 397648 Rocky is exhausted!
399441 401276 We did it! We did it!
403028 405948 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the winner by knockout...
406990 408367 Are you all right?
408450 411119 Never better. Never better.
411203 415082 Once again, the heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
415165 420754 the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.
450784 453495 Today may have proved to be a landmark<br />in sports history.
453578 455330 - After unraveling red tape...<br />- Come on!
455414 457791 ...Russia will now throw its hat into the ring.
457874 459001 The prize ring, that is.
459084 461920 The introductions were made by his wife,<br />Ludmilla Vobet Drago.
462004 464006 She was the double gold medalist<br />in swimming.
464089 467926 Today, the Soviet Union has officially entered<br />professional boxing.
468010 472556 My husband and great undefeated<br />heavyweight world amateur champion,
472639 474433 Captain Ivan Drago,
474516 476685 has come here with his trainers to America
476768 479396 to compete as an international sportsman
479479 481106 and ambassador of goodwill.
481189 484443 If possible, we would like<br />to have an exhibition bout
484526 486737 with your great champion Rocky Balboa
486820 489990 as a way to introduce Drago to America.
490073 491408 Has Balboa responded?
491491 493368 No, he has not responded.
493452 495120 Drago is still an amateur.
495203 497372 What makes you think<br />he can stand up to the pressure
497456 500584 of fighting someone as seasoned<br />and strong as Balboa?
501209 504838 Drago is the most perfectly trained athlete<br />in the world.
504921 507382 There is no one who can match<br />his strength, his endurance,
507466 508967 or his aggressiveness.
509051 513096 - You make it sound like he's indestructible.<br />- Yes, he is.
513180 514848 Well, can this mammoth Russian,
514931 517351 who's already been nicknamed<br />the "Siberian Express"
517434 520604 wreak havoc among the professional<br />heavyweight ranks?
520687 523857 Whoever he fights first, it'll be one hot ticket.
523940 527778 We'll be right back with a check on today's<br />pro football sports scoreboard.
529279 533033 Those Russians are serious about their giant<br />taking your title. You know that?
533116 534743 I've heard some talk.
535702 538497 It's a lot more than talk, Stallion.<br />A lot more than talk.
539414 540624 They get to you?
540707 544294 Well, they were talking<br />to the boxing commission
544378 547089 about me and this guy<br />putting on this exhibition, you know.
547172 549257 Yeah. What'd you say?
550133 552219 I say, I don't know.
553011 554388 Say, what'd you say?
555889 558016 - Say?<br />- Yeah, what'd you say?
558100 560602 I said, "I don't know."
562604 566149 - What you're saying is you don't wanna fight.<br />- No, no, no.
566233 568110 No. What I'm saying is,
568902 571196 why do it, you know, until I have to?
572364 575450 Well, you don't mind me beating up on him<br />a little bit, now, do you?
575534 577744 - You what?<br />- Yeah. What?
577828 579329 You think I don't have it anymore?
579413 581581 You got nothing more to prove, do you?
581665 583792 Look, man, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
583875 586878 This isn't just another boxer<br />climbing through the ropes.
586962 589089 This is a Russian propaganda machine<br />starting up.
589965 592968 And they didn't miss a thing.<br />They had to try to win the women over
593051 595095 by having this Russian's wife telling everybody
595178 596847 what a great guy Drago is.
597848 600559 Look, this is politics all the way. Politics.
601726 605105 This is a chance to stand face-to-face<br />with their best. I mean...
605188 609568 it'd be more important than ever.<br />It'd be in the history books. Right.
609651 611695 Listen, Adrian just cooked dinner.
611778 613697 Why don't we go up? We'll eat, we'll talk.
613780 615824 She'd love to see you. Really.
615907 619828 All right, yeah.<br />Never turn down a great Italian meal, right?
619911 622289 - All right.<br />- Hut one, hut two.
626001 629713 My husband and I thank you for coming<br />to our training quarter today.
629796 631798 As you see, it is highly advanced,
631882 634176 and we wish to show the American press
634259 637596 a small portion of the advances<br />our country's made
637679 640056 in the technology of human performance.
640140 643101 What does all this do<br />to enhance performance?
643185 646021 It makes a man a better man,
646104 648523 a great athlete, a super athlete,
648607 650942 by harnessing all of his strength.
651026 654279 Though most of the world<br />is ignorant in body chemistry,
654362 655280 we wish to...
656198 657699 educate your country.
657782 659451 Shall we have a demonstration?
659534 661286 - Please do.<br />- Thank you.
668084 674174 As you can see,<br />Drago averages 1850 pounds,
674257 676384 so the result's quite obvious.
676468 679346 Whatever he hits, he destroys.
680222 682766 I've seen this Drago fight<br />when he was an amateur.
682849 685352 He's big and he's strong, but he's clumsy.
685435 686770 I know I can beat him.
689022 691399 - You can do your homework.<br />- Okay. Later, Dad.
691483 693568 Later, Uncle Paulie. Later, Apollo.
693652 695737 - Later, big man.<br />- See you later, kiddo.
696738 700492 Don't you think people are expecting<br />to see Rocky whack this bum out first?
700575 702869 Yeah, and he will, when it's for real.
703787 705956 This is just an exhibition bout. It's kids' stuff.
706039 707249 What's the purpose?
707332 709751 What at this point in your life<br />is worth getting hurt for?
709834 713213 I don't want this chump to come over here<br />with all that hype, you know,
713296 716466 trying to make us look bad.<br />They try every other way.
718009 719886 - I think it's wrong.<br />- No.
719970 721179 It's never been more right.
721263 725100 It's not the Middle Ages when armies<br />sent over their best fighters
725183 728270 to kill each other.<br />We're supposed to be civilized.
729354 730939 You're a great fighter,
731022 732691 but you've been retired for five years.
732774 735151 Don't you think it's time to think<br />about something else?
735235 738697 I mean, how much can you take?<br />Either of you.
742367 743618 I'll get the coffee.
746371 748540 Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
749499 751418 I just care about you both. I...
759884 761761 Just relax. I'll be right back.
770478 772188 You're not mad, are you?
772272 773607 No, I'm not mad.
774941 776151 Just have a bad feeling.
776860 780572 You know Apollo. He's got<br />this big imagination, you know.
780655 783491 With Apollo, he needs to be loved.
783575 785619 He just can't stand being forgotten.
785702 788163 I guess he's gonna have to face up to it.
788997 789831 So do you.
791374 792792 Yeah, I know.
794210 796171 All this won't happen if you don't back it.
797130 799758 Apollo, he thinks he's fighting<br />for the whole country,
799841 802636 but his reasons are wrong.
802719 804179 It's... It's...
804262 806389 It's like a bad publicity stunt.
806473 809100 I don't want you getting upset.<br />You're not upset, are you?
809184 812062 - I'm not upset.<br />- You sure? You're okay?
812687 813688 - You sure?<br />- Sure.
813772 815607 Wanna go a few rounds at the bag?
816149 817859 - Okay.<br />- Champ!
818818 820236 - Thank you.<br />- No problem.
827452 829913 - This was a great fight.<br />- This was great.
831539 834125 Mamma mia! What you using<br />for a chin there, Stallion?
836002 837379 I should have slipped that one.
837462 839339 You definitely should've slipped that one.
841091 842258 Ain't it something?
842342 845220 It's crazy how people, they care about you<br />when you're in that ring
845303 846429 and when you're bleeding,
846513 848056 but once you step out of that ring,
848139 851101 - it's like you're ancient history.<br />- Can I ask you something?
851726 852977 What?
853603 856189 Well, this fight you're having<br />against the Russian...
856272 859359 Do you think maybe it ain't against him?
860860 865073 Well, do you think maybe it's, like,<br />you against you? What do you think?
866241 868159 I don't think I want to hear this, Stallion.
868243 869911 Come on. Hey, Apollo, look,
869994 871996 you were a great fighter, no doubt about that,
872080 874124 but we gotta face the facts too.
875083 877502 You don't want to believe it,<br />but maybe the show is over.
877585 880088 Easy for you to say. You're still on top.
880171 882882 Let's face it, we gotta change sometime.
882966 885552 I don't want to change. I like who I am!
885635 887345 But look at that, you know?
887429 890265 You don't want to believe this,<br />but that ain't us up there no more.
890348 893810 We can't do that the way we did it before.<br />We're changing.
893893 898231 Maybe you think you're changing,<br />but you can't change what you really are.
898314 901401 And you can forget all this money and stuff<br />you got all around you, man,
901484 902861 because it don't change a thing.
904028 907449 You and me, we don't even have a choice.
907991 909409 We're born with a killer instinct
909492 912912 that you can't just turn off and on<br />like some radio.
913955 917083 We have to be right in the middle of the action<br />because we're the warriors.
917167 920670 And without some challenge,<br />without some damn war to fight,
920754 922922 then the warrior may as well be dead, Stallion.
927469 928636 All right? So...
929763 931055 So I'm asking you...
932849 934142 as a friend...
938980 942442 stand in my corner just this one last time.
946905 950992 - What made you decide to put on a fight?<br />- Let's call it sense of responsibility.
951075 953369 Responsibility how?
953453 956706 I had to teach this young fellow to box,<br />American style.
956790 960335 Apollo, isn't Drago a little inexperienced<br />to be in the same ring?
960418 964339 Well, you know, some folks<br />got to learn the hard way.
964422 966007 So no quick knockout prediction?
966090 968510 No, no, no. I'm not mad at him.
968593 970094 I just want to show the whole world
970178 972222 that Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.
972305 974224 Rocky, aren't you helping to train Apollo?
974307 977185 Well, yeah, I'm gonna try if he'll listen.
977268 979103 Wait. What do you mean, "listen," Stallion?
979187 981898 - It's hard to get a word in edgeways.<br />- Come on.
981981 984108 - It's hard.<br />- Come on, man. My man.
986236 987821 - Rocky.<br />- Yeah.
987904 990824 - How do you think Apollo should fight Drago?<br />- How?
990907 995203 Well, personally,<br />I think you're gonna need a very big ladder.
995286 998540 Drago, how does it feel to spar<br />with the great former champion?
1000834 1003336 The man's tongue didn't come<br />through customs.
1006506 1009342 You don't think you gonna whip me,<br />do you?
1014097 1016599 I did not come here to lose.
1019102 1021271 So no quick knockout prediction.
1021354 1022730 Excuse, please.
1022814 1025233 You are not very realistic, are you, Mr. Creed?
1025316 1027360 Where did you come from?<br />What you talking about?
1027443 1031406 You can box, yes, but you are far too old<br />to win over Drago.
1031489 1034117 - Is that a fact?<br />- It could be a painful one.
1034200 1036411 Put that heavy bag with eyeballs<br />in the ring with me,
1036494 1038246 and you're gonna see pain.
1038329 1039414 Why do you insult us?
1039497 1041249 Don't make me out to be the bad guy.
1041332 1045169 I came here to talk about a friendly bout<br />till Comrade Bigmouth started up.
1045253 1047463 It is you who are the aggressor. This is obvious.
1047547 1050550 I wish to say to the press, in all fairness,
1050633 1054762 Drago should not even fight this man,<br />because the truth is, he is a has-been.
1056723 1059434 To defeat him is an accomplishment<br />not worthy of Drago.
1059517 1063438 But to fight the real champion,<br />this means something.
1063521 1066149 You get that big chump in the ring right now,
1066232 1068234 and I'll show you what I have.
1069819 1071112 Bring it on!
1074324 1077118 - Apollo!<br />- All right, all right. All right.
1077201 1078536 All right, I said what I feel.
1079495 1082165 - We're gonna finish this in the ring.<br />- Wherever you like.
1082248 1084751 Look, you just shut up.<br />We're gonna finish this in the ring.
1084834 1086294 Understand me? I'm talking to you.
1086377 1088046 You too, and all these puppets you got.
1088129 1090089 - Wherever you like.<br />- How did I do?
1090173 1092050 - Little loud for my taste.<br />- Wait. But good?
1092133 1093718 Yeah, very good.
1095470 1097221 The city of lights, Las Vegas
1097305 1100600 and to one of the most unusual<br />events in years,
1100683 1101935 East meets West,
1102018 1105480 age versus youth,<br />in a goodwill exhibition match,
1105563 1107982 as the former champion Apollo Creed
1108066 1112195 takes on a mountain of muscle<br />from the Soviet Union, Ivan Drago.
1113071 1116032 Apollo! Apollo!
1116115 1118076 Apollo! Apollo!
1135009 1135885 Ivan!
1181764 1182849 Go home!
1324740 1326325 I feel good!
1343301 1344385 Good evening, everyone.
1344468 1346429 Along with Warner Wolf, I'm Stu Nahan,
1346512 1348431 and we welcome you to a most unusual event:
1348514 1351934 For the first time ever, West against East<br />in professional sports.
1352018 1353686 God, I feel born again.
1353769 1358274 Tonight's special event<br />features two great athletes.
1358357 1359817 In the blue corner,
1359901 1362236 weighing 221 pounds,
1362320 1365781 a former heavyweight champion of the world,
1365865 1367867 the Dancing Destroyer,
1368492 1369952 the King of Sting,
1370786 1373414 the Count of Monte Fisto...
1373497 1376542 - You think you got enough names?<br />- Patience, Stallion. Almost done.
1376626 1379754 ...the one and only Apollo Creed!
1381255 1382840 Come on!
1387136 1390598 The crowd anticipating a great fight now<br />as Apollo is in the ring.
1390681 1392350 He's playing to the crowd.
1398064 1399690 Apollo!
1402652 1408032 In the red corner,<br />weighing an even 261 pounds,
1408115 1412245 gold medalist and undefeated<br />world amateur champion
1412328 1414288 from the Soviet Union,
1415414 1418167 the Siberian Bull,
1418251 1420670 Ivan Drago.
1431847 1435184 I want you! I want you! I want you!
1435268 1438562 I want you! I want you, Drago!
1438646 1440481 Now they come to the center of the ring
1440564 1443484 for the instructions from referee Lou Filippo.
1443567 1444860 You boys know the rules.
1444944 1448155 Watch your low blows,<br />kidney punches, rabbit punches.
1448239 1449240 In case of a knockdown,
1449323 1452868 go to the corner I tell you to and stay there<br />until I tell you to come out.
1452952 1454829 Shake hands. Let's have a good fight.
1456831 1458457 Come on, get your hands up!
1458541 1459583 You need an interpreter?
1461502 1462920 You will lose.
1465047 1467842 - Why don't you land him on his head?<br />- All right.
1469302 1472430 The bad blood between these two<br />can be felt all over this arena.
1472513 1474849 I can't get over the size of this Russian.
1474932 1477226 Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!
1477310 1478936 Get ready, because it's show time!
1479020 1482023 It's show time! It's show time!
1482940 1483941 Come on.
1484025 1486068 And Apollo seems to be<br />in great spirits tonight.
1486152 1489530 He's really putting on a show<br />for this capacity crowd.
1490573 1492033 Be back in a minute.
1494243 1495328 Round one.
1497371 1499206 Creed dancing around.
1499290 1501375 Creed backpedaling now.<br />Been away five years...
1501459 1503377 Don't wait on him. Get on first.
1507423 1509633 Come on! He may be big...
1509717 1512261 Come on. Come on, chump.
1514138 1516682 - Come on!<br />- Come on, come on. Come on.
1516766 1518142 Neither fighter ready to punch.
1518225 1521854 A left jab there. A left jab once again by Creed.
1523272 1524357 Double up the jab!
1526692 1528736 - A slip by Creed.<br />- Let's see what you got.
1528819 1531280 This is bizarre. Creed is over the hill,
1531364 1533240 and the Russian hasn't fought anybody.
1533324 1534700 Keep it going! Keep it going!
1543376 1546045 - All right, Apollo! Keep moving!<br />- Come on!
1549215 1550466 Keep it going! Keep it going!
1551842 1553552 Don't wait on him. Get on first.
1555554 1558140 Keep him bottled! Keep your chin down!
1558224 1559683 Keep moving, Apollo! Stick him!
1559767 1561268 Drago moving in again.
1561352 1563771 A left hand by Creed,<br />another left hand by Creed,
1563854 1565147 and Drago moves away.
1565231 1566607 All right, come on!
1570820 1572905 You're the best, Apollo. You're the best.
1572988 1574240 Come on.
1578744 1579912 Get your hands up.
1581872 1583958 Another left hand by Creed.
1584041 1587044 Drago waiting, waiting,<br />cocking that right hand.
1588963 1590214 Attack him!
1592091 1593676 A crushing right by the Russian!
1597138 1599515 Get out of there! Stay away from him!
1601350 1602977 Get out of there!
1603060 1604437 He's taking some punishment now!
1604520 1606063 Drago moves him against the ropes.
1608107 1609358 Tie him up now!
1609442 1611360 Left hand ties him up.
1611444 1613446 Now the Russian throws Creed<br />across the ring.
1613529 1614613 Move!
1615281 1617700 The Russian's got Creed stuck now.
1618451 1619827 Tie him up!
1627543 1631046 One, two, three...
1631130 1632548 Get up, man. Come on!
1632631 1635217 ...four, five, six.
1638804 1640055 Clinch! Clinch!
1642183 1643726 All right!
1646020 1648147 - Clinch!<br />- It is Drago with the upper hand now,
1648230 1650191 Drago with the left to the midsection.
1650274 1651400 Get out of that corner!
1651484 1654195 Another right hand thrown by Drago.
1655154 1657448 - Can Creed stay up?<br />- Apollo!
1657531 1659408 But Creed... Creed is against the ropes.
1659492 1660868 What's the matter with you guys?
1662661 1665789 What are you guys doing?<br />This is supposed to be an exhibition!
1665873 1668542 You understand? An exhibition!
1668626 1671587 A tremendous end to the first round<br />by the Russian,
1671670 1673672 and a very bloody Apollo Creed.
1674965 1677426 The Soviet's strength is incredible!
1680804 1682765 Champ, look, I gotta stop it.
1682848 1684725 Don't you dare stop this fight.
1685267 1687353 Man, don't do this to me.
1687436 1688979 I'm doing this for me.
1689855 1690940 I'm here to fight.
1691941 1693275 Don't you stop this fight.
1693359 1696946 Boy, I'll tell you, that was a pulverizing round<br />for the ex-champion.
1697029 1700699 Hey, folks, Ivan Drago is definitely for real.
1700783 1702243 Apollo! Apollo!
1702326 1703911 If you're my friend...
1705663 1706789 don't you stop this fight.
1706872 1709500 Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!
1709583 1711126 No matter what.
1711210 1714463 Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!
1723806 1726016 Creed now comes out for round two.
1728727 1731272 The Russian's trying to intimidate Creed.
1731355 1732940 Come on, pull it together!
1748372 1750416 Russian throws a right hand<br />and staggers Creed!
1750499 1753210 Another right to the jaw!<br />Another right to the head!
1753294 1755212 Time up now! Time up!
1757214 1758090 Drago!
1760009 1761427 Stop the fight!
1761510 1763012 The referee tries to step in,
1763095 1764513 and he's thrown across the ring.
1764597 1766640 Throw the towel! Throw the towel!
1772229 1774648 Apollo!
1782698 1784617 Apollo!
1785659 1787786 - Apollo!<br />- Creed is down!
1790748 1793584 Apollo is down, and he could be badly hurt.
1793667 1795085 Let him breathe!
1795169 1797630 - Move back!<br />- Get these guys out of here.
1797713 1799965 The winner, Ivan Drago.
1800049 1802301 Let me through! Apollo!
1802384 1805137 - I cannot be defeated.<br />- Somebody get a doctor in here!
1805638 1808849 Soon, I defeat real champion.
1808932 1811810 - Stand back.<br />- Let him breathe. Come on, Apollo.
1811894 1816649 Soon, whole world will know my name.
1817941 1819026 Drago.
1823238 1824657 Drago.
1828369 1831955 What started out as a joke<br />has turned out to be a disaster.
1832039 1834375 If he dies, he dies.
1843050 1845469 Men are made for the end in the beginning.
1847262 1848931 Apollo Creed was a warrior.
1849848 1853560 He lived and he died by the code of a warrior.
1854853 1858816 A warrior has the right<br />to choose his way of life...
1859983 1861276 and his way of death.
1862736 1869326 And we are bound to respect this sacred rite.
1869410 1871370 In this life we live,
1872079 1875624 there's always a possibility of holy intrusion.
1875708 1877960 And so it was that Apollo came to know
1878627 1882423 that none of his successors had come close
1882506 1886635 to satisfying the questions he had inside.
1887594 1891974 He gave his life to know those answers.
1902151 1906155 I owe everything I got...
1908073 1911285 and my family has got...
1912619 1913579 to you.
1920794 1923005 You gave me a break...
1926008 1927384 when no one else would.
1929219 1930512 You believed in me...
1932431 1933807 when no one else would.
1935642 1937352 I really loved you, man.
1959750 1960959 I let it happen.
1961043 1964463 No, you didn't. It's no one's fault.
1964546 1966757 You can't put all that blame on yourself.
1967883 1969176 He was your friend.
1969259 1972638 You would have done anything to protect him.<br />You have to believe that.
1983690 1987569 We've gone over these facts<br />many times, Mr. Balboa.
1987653 1989363 The answer is still the same.
1989446 1991240 Can't you change the rules?
1992115 1994701 Under present federation rules,
1994785 2000165 any fight between you and this Russian<br />cannot, nor will it be allowed.
2001083 2002292 Let's be realistic.
2003669 2010384 The Russian, he has not yet<br />had one legitimate professional fight.
2011760 2017641 The bout he had with Creed<br />was a publicity stunt that backfired!
2017724 2021562 What you guys are really saying is<br />you don't think I have a chance, do you?
2021645 2026024 Come on. What we're trying to say is,<br />why tempt fate?
2026108 2028443 Let's find out more about this man.
2028527 2030362 Let's see what develops.
2031113 2035450 He's had one professional fight,<br />and one man is dead.
2035534 2039037 But if it prevents another fatality,
2039121 2041039 - it's well worth it.<br />- Of course.
2041123 2043834 Best way to a boxing ban is one more accident.
2043917 2046086 Especially of this magnitude.
2046169 2049089 Do you realize what kind of a magnitude this is?
2049715 2050883 Excuse me.
2051383 2053302 Do you wanna know what the bottom line is?
2054011 2057055 You got rules. We've got rules.
2057639 2060225 Everybody's got to abide by those rules.
2065856 2067065 Is the decision final?
2068358 2069610 Yes.
2069693 2070986 Rocky, over here, please.
2071069 2073572 Is this the first time<br />the champion has given up his crown?
2073655 2074489 I don't know.
2074573 2077159 Doesn't the title mean anything<br />to you anymore?
2077242 2078619 Not until this is over.
2078702 2082372 Look, we know you've agreed to fight,<br />but don't you think you're moving too quickly?
2082456 2083832 Drago's ready now.
2083916 2086376 Drago, what does this fight mean to you?
2086960 2088337 Do you have any feelings on it?
2089963 2090923 No.
2091423 2094134 Drago has told me that<br />this will be an easy fight.
2094217 2096178 Can't Drago speak for himself?
2096762 2097596 Yes.
2098263 2099306 Yes, well?
2099389 2103477 It's a matter of science and evolution.
2103560 2105479 Isn't it, gentlemen?
2106146 2108148 Drago is 13 years younger,
2108231 2111193 and the most perfectly trained fighter ever.
2111276 2113278 This other man has not the size,
2113362 2116490 or the endurance, or the genetics to win.
2116573 2120285 It's physically impossible<br />for this little man to win.
2122621 2125749 Drago is a look at the future.
2125832 2128001 Has the fight date been set yet?
2128085 2129294 December 25th.
2129378 2131755 - Why Christmas?<br />- That's what I was told.
2131838 2132923 Where?
2133465 2135592 - It's in Russia.<br />- Are you nuts?
2135676 2136802 Why did you agree to this?
2136885 2139888 We fight in Soviet Union, or we fight nowhere.
2142224 2144726 This country could never judge a fight fair.
2145519 2147729 What makes you say<br />he's not being treated fairly?
2147813 2149606 It is more lies and false propaganda
2149690 2153944 to support this antagonistic<br />and violent government!
2154903 2155821 Violent?
2155904 2159241 Hey, we don't keep our people<br />behind a wall with machine guns!
2159324 2161660 - Who are you?<br />- Who am I?
2161743 2164621 I'm the unsilent majority, bigmouth!
2164705 2167791 Good! Yes, good! Insult us!
2167874 2171795 Is more typical rude behavior<br />toward visiting foreigners.
2171878 2174256 But perhaps this simple defeat
2174339 2176550 of this little so-called champion
2176633 2180345 will be a perfect example<br />of how pathetically weak
2180429 2182514 your society has become!
2182597 2183557 We go!
2193316 2195027 Rocky, over here.
2195110 2196987 Rocky, can you tell us about...
2200240 2202534 Mrs. Balboa! Mrs. Balboa!
2202617 2204870 - Adrian.<br />- How do you feel about going to Russia?
2204953 2206955 - Is your husband going to Moscow?<br />- Mrs. Balboa!
2208582 2209416 Adrian! Adrian!
2209499 2212044 Mrs. Balboa, did Creed's death<br />make up your husband's mind?
2212127 2215547 - I don't know what you're talking about!<br />- When will you be going to Russia?
2215630 2219342 Look, I'm not going to Russia.<br />I don't know what you're talking about.
2219426 2222804 I don't know why you're here.<br />I don't know what you people are doing here!
2222888 2224598 - Mrs. Balboa!<br />- Was it his decision?
2225140 2225974 Mrs. Balboa!
2226058 2227601 - Mrs. Balboa!<br />- Mrs. Balboa!
2250082 2252292 - Rocky?<br />- Yeah?
2256963 2257964 You all right?
2258799 2260675 Yeah. Fine.
2261760 2262928 Why'd you do it?
2266723 2270477 - I just gotta do what I gotta do.<br />- You don't have to do anything.
2273980 2275857 No, Adrian, I do, and...
2277859 2279945 I gotta leave this place too.
2280028 2282030 So where are you going?
2282739 2285450 They said they're going to let me train<br />in Russia, and...
2286493 2288662 I just want to go someplace where
2289204 2291790 I ain't gonna think about nothing except him.
2291873 2294334 Rocky, give it some time.
2294417 2297546 Don't do this. A lot of people live with hurt.
2298171 2300966 Adrian, a lot of people don't have a choice. I do.
2301049 2303718 And for that, you're willing to lose everything?
2308181 2310225 There's a lot more than this.
2310809 2314938 Before, there were reasons to fight<br />I could understand, but I don't understand this.
2315021 2318567 Even if you win, Apollo's still gone.
2321653 2324823 Why can't you change your thinking?<br />Everybody else does!
2324906 2325949 'Cause I'm a fighter.
2326032 2329327 Do you know what everybody says?<br />That it's suicide!
2329411 2332414 You've seen him.<br />You know how strong he is.
2332497 2333915 You can't win!
2344885 2346636 Adrian.
2348889 2350473 Adrian.
2355353 2357522 Adrian always tells the truth.
2361484 2362736 No, maybe I can't.
2364362 2365530 I don't know.
2366281 2367240 I don't know.
2655987 2657197 Are you scared?
2658781 2662243 - No.<br />- Yes, you are. A little, maybe?
2664621 2666831 Well, to tell you the truth,
2668583 2670919 sometimes, I get a little scared, you know?
2671503 2675006 When I'm in that ring and I'm getting hit on,
2675798 2679802 and my arms hurt so much<br />I can't even lift them up anymore,
2679886 2683515 and I'm hoping that the other guy<br />hits me right on the chin
2683598 2685892 so I don't feel nothing anymore.
2687519 2691523 There's this other side<br />that isn't so scared, you know.
2692273 2695360 There's this side that wants to take more,
2696569 2699322 that wants to go one more round.
2701032 2704035 'Cause, you know,<br />going that one more round...
2705537 2708414 it's what makes the difference in your life.
2709666 2712627 You know, there's gonna be a time
2713628 2719008 when you're gonna have to do things<br />that other people don't think are right,
2720009 2722845 but you know they're gonna be right for you.
2724097 2727600 And I don't care<br />if everybody thinks they're wrong.
2728351 2730228 You gotta do what you gotta do.
2731437 2734023 You understand? You gotta do it for you.
2737527 2740947 It's the most important thing I could tell you.
2741573 2742782 This is what it's all about.
2744701 2748621 You gotta live for yourself,<br />'cause you gotta live with yourself.
2749289 2750540 You know what I mean?
2757338 2758464 Rocky.
2764304 2765930 Come on! The meter's running!
2766806 2768516 I guess this is it.
2769726 2771227 I can't make you stay?
2773896 2778443 You know, I gotta go. I gotta go.
2778526 2783156 Rocky, please. I want you to stay.<br />Please don't go.
2787035 2792206 Adrian, listen to me.<br />Remember, a long time ago...
2795376 2799088 I once said to you I never asked you<br />to stop being a woman?
2801007 2803259 Don't ask me to stop being a man.
2807221 2808431 You'll be all right.
2809182 2810558 You'll be all right.
2891514 2893141 What a horrendous flight.
2895560 2896602 This is Russia?
2897270 2898938 They don't look so tough, Rocky.
2899856 2902525 Hey, Paulie. What are you doing<br />with Adrian's earmuffs?
2902608 2904152 They look better on me.
2914954 2916456 Mr. Balboa.
2918750 2920543 We take you to quarters now.
2922879 2925298 Get in the car. We have very long trip.
2925965 2929177 - Sounds like Dracula's cousin.<br />- Come on, Paulie.
2989195 2991405 Like you request, yes?
2992198 2994617 - You requested this dumb location?<br />- Yeah.
2995326 2998538 Why? You planning to grow<br />reindeer or something?
2998621 3001582 The equipment you requested is in barn.
3005211 3007004 - Who are they?<br />- They?
3007588 3009131 They are assigned to you.
3010424 3012051 Official chaperones, yes?
3012927 3015221 Where you go, they go.
3015304 3017390 When do the sparring partners get here?
3017473 3018683 Spar?
3020101 3022895 We provide no sparring partners.
3022979 3024564 We're supposed to have them.
3024647 3026774 This, I do not know.
3027984 3030820 You have everything<br />I have been instructed to provide.
3031612 3033197 We are finished, yes?
3045710 3046961 No sparring?
3051340 3053718 I don't think I need it anymore, Paulie.
3054635 3057013 No sparring, no TV, nothing?
3057096 3060099 How the heck is he supposed<br />to train around here?
3074780 3076908 It's a good place to die.
3099931 3101182 Checkmate, friend.
3107855 3109482 No, maybe I can't win.
3109565 3113778 Maybe the only thing I can do<br />is just take everything he's got.
3114946 3116197 But to beat me,
3117073 3118699 he's gonna have to kill me.
3119575 3120493 And to kill me,
3121202 3123829 he's gonna have to have the heart<br />to stand in front of me.
3124497 3125331 And to do that,
3126374 3128584 he's gotta be willing to die himself.
3129460 3131462 I don't know if he's ready to do that.
3133172 3134215 I don't know.
3136842 3139595 - Yeah?<br />- Hey, champ, can I come up?
3139679 3140721 Yeah, sure.
3144225 3146560 - How you doing?<br />- Pretty good.
3146644 3148854 Some kind of weather<br />we're having up here?
3148938 3150398 Yeah, it's pretty rough.
3151023 3153442 But for what you gotta do, it's good.
3155403 3157697 - Toughen you up.<br />- I guess so.
3158322 3160992 I know you're gonna have to do<br />almost everything alone up here,
3161492 3162952 but you know I'll be with you.
3163035 3163953 Yeah, I know.
3164996 3166455 Apollo was like my son.
3168249 3169333 I raised him.
3170876 3173754 And when he died, part of me died.
3175715 3177842 But now you're the one.
3178634 3181595 You're the one<br />that's gonna keep his spirit alive.
3181679 3185725 You're the one that's gonna make sure<br />that he didn't die for nothing.
3187435 3189603 Now, you're gonna<br />have to go through hell,
3190187 3192523 worse than any nightmare<br />that you ever dreamed.
3193733 3194900 But in the end,
3196360 3198404 I know you'll be the one standing.
3200656 3201782 I'll try.
3205619 3206495 I'll try.
3214003 3215296 You know what to do.
3217798 3218924 Do it.
3475848 3477850 I couldn't stay away anymore.
3485149 3486150 I missed you.
3489778 3490821 I missed you.
3493157 3495117 I'm with you, no matter what.
3597469 3598470 No pain.
3601348 3603308 No pain. No pain.
3642723 3644099 Go on, push it up.
3649730 3651482 Come on, push!
3653609 3655986 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Push it up!
3663952 3666205 Drago!
3751123 3755669 Drago!
3757045 3760757 Drago!
3763218 3766138 Drago!
3769891 3772936 Hello, everybody, and Merry Christmas<br />from a very unusual place.
3773020 3775355 We're in Moscow,<br />in the Soviet Union.
3775439 3777566 I'm Barry Tompkins,<br />with Al Bandiero,
3777649 3779901 and this promises to be<br />the most-watched event
3779985 3781069 in boxing history.
3781153 3784031 The Iron Horse, from America,<br />Rocky Balboa.
3788577 3789536 Ivan Drago,
3789620 3793248 since that tragedy in Las Vegas<br />and the death of Apollo Creed,
3793332 3796168 he's been re-nicknamed<br />"Death from Above."
3826948 3829743 And high above us,<br />the general secretary of the Soviet
3829826 3831411 and other members of the Politburo
3831495 3833163 have now made<br />their way to their seats
3833246 3835540 high above the ring<br />here in Moscow.
3848011 3850305 You don't know anything<br />about this guy you're fighting.
3850389 3853225 It's just some exhibition fight.<br />This ain't gonna mean nothing.
3854601 3857312 You may not understand<br />what I'm talking about now.
3857396 3858563 I can appreciate that.
3858647 3860357 But you will when it's over.<br />Believe me.
3862234 3863652 You will when it's over.
3871576 3874079 Rock, I know<br />you're kind of busy just now,
3874162 3876748 but I want to tell you<br />some things I never told you.
3876832 3880043 I know sometimes I act stupid<br />and I say stupid things,
3880627 3881962 but you kept me around
3882045 3884172 when other people<br />would have said, "Drop that bum."
3884256 3885340 You give me respect.
3885424 3888218 It's hard for me<br />to say these kind of things,
3888301 3890137 because that ain't my way,
3890220 3893515 but if I could just unzip myself<br />and step out and be someone else,
3893598 3894891 I'd want to be you.
3895642 3897018 You're all heart, Rock.
3900188 3901273 Thanks, Paulie.
3902607 3904693 Now, blast this guy's teeth out.
3905610 3906611 I'll try.
3939436 3940896 Right now, one of the fighters
3940979 3943899 is starting to make his way<br />through this crowd and toward the ring.
3943982 3945609 Listen to this crowd!
3945692 3948737 We knew he wouldn't be popular,<br />but this borders on pure hatred.
3961583 3964294 Rocky's face, absolutely like stone.
3964377 3966630 He is the picture of concentration,
3966713 3969966 and the booing crowd here<br />does not seem to bother him one bit.
3970050 3973303 The champ has a look tonight<br />that can burn through lead.
3973386 3976056 What Rocky Balboa<br />really brings to this dance
3976139 3978183 is a lot of heart<br />and a lot of determination,
3978266 3980727 but then he gives away strength<br />and gives away size,
3980811 3983897 and maybe even more important,<br />he gives away age.
3985148 3989110 It seems that the booing crowd<br />has absolutely no effect on the man.
3989194 3991822 His concentration<br />seems to be like stone.
3992531 3994908 Listen to this crowd.<br />It sounds insane.
3994991 3999204 The power of Ivan Drago<br />is virtually a biochemical product.
3999287 4002916 The man is infinitely stronger<br />than Rocky Balboa, and a foot taller.
4002999 4005710 Every punch is a lethal weapon.
4005794 4009005 And now the entrance<br />of the Russian national champion,
4010048 4013969 Ivan Drago, a man<br />with an entire country in his corner.
4093632 4096259 Look at the expression<br />on the face of Ivan Drago.
4096343 4099346 He seems impervious<br />to this madness of the crowd.
4099429 4102515 He's like a volcano<br />just waiting to erupt.
4104809 4108396 The Russian champion<br />is amazingly cool, ladies and gentlemen,
4108480 4110482 as he acknowledges his premier.
4226723 4228933 Ladies and gentlemen...
4242280 4243239 It's unbelievable.
4243323 4246993 I have never, in all my years,<br />seen such a hostile crowd.
4267263 4269891 The two men are walking<br />toward the center of the ring.
4271392 4273061 It's an unbelievable sight to see.
4274437 4275730 They're toe to toe.
4276523 4278608 The Russian towers<br />above the American.
4278691 4281569 It's a true case<br />of David and Goliath here.
4281653 4285156 It's unbelievable,<br />the condition of both men,
4285240 4286866 but the Russian champion...
4286950 4288284 I must break you.
4295500 4297502 Remember what I said<br />about wanting to be you?
4297585 4298795 Yeah.
4298878 4300088 Forget it.
4309848 4311224 Take it straight to him, now.
4311307 4313810 Take it straight to him<br />and be a rock for me, understand?
4316229 4318106 There's the bell<br />for the opening round,
4318189 4320692 and Rocky Balboa comes out<br />to the center of the ring.
4320775 4323111 But the Russian, right back<br />into Balboa's corner now.
4326698 4328241 Come on, baby!
4329617 4330785 Spit him out, Rock!
4333413 4335081 Balboa gets out of the corner now,
4335165 4338877 and now, once more, it is Drago<br />backing Rocky Balboa up with a jab,
4338960 4340795 and Balboa is not staying on balance
4340879 4342922 because of the<br />long jab of the Russian.
4346384 4347552 Keep working, Rock.
4359731 4362025 Brace yourself! Brace yourself!
4362108 4364736 Get up! Hands up!
4364819 4366237 Charge him! Charge him!
4366321 4368656 He can't seem to touch the Russian.
4373036 4373995 Cut him down!
4380710 4383296 Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble.
4383379 4386758 They might have to stop this one<br />before somebody gets killed.
4386841 4389344 Reach and grab him!<br />Reach and grab him!
4389427 4390720 Rocky's hurt.
4393097 4397644 A right hand from Drago sends<br />Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring!
4397727 4398811 And the champ is down!
4398895 4400271 Back up!
4400855 4404984 Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!
4405068 4407445 Breathe. Don't be scared.
4409447 4410448 I can do it.
4412617 4413451 Get up.
4414827 4415662 Get up.
4415745 4416704 Come on, get up!
4416788 4419499 Drago! Drago! Drago!
4419582 4423253 Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!
4425505 4426631 Come on, Rock!
4431219 4434389 Drago continuing<br />to punish Rocky Balboa.
4434472 4436349 He just will not<br />let him out of that corner,
4436432 4440395 and Rocky Balboa is just trying<br />to get through this first round.
4442814 4447777 The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa<br />into his own corner like a rag doll.
4447860 4452699 Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!
4458371 4459998 Way to go, Rock. Come on.
4460581 4462959 You're fine. You're fine.
4464294 4466713 It's been a tough first three minutes<br />for Rocky Balboa.
4466796 4470008 He's not only fighting what appears<br />to be an invincible opponent,
4470091 4472260 he's also fighting<br />a very hostile crowd
4472343 4476723 and the Russian premier<br />and most of the Politburo looking on.
4477724 4479517 What's happening out there?
4479600 4480810 He's winning.
4482437 4484188 I see three of him out there.
4484272 4486232 - Hit the one in the middle.<br />- Right.
4486316 4489360 Keep taking it till it's got him. Okay?<br />That's gonna hurt him.
4489444 4492113 - No pain.<br />- No pain. No pain.
4492864 4494657 Okay? Keep taking it to him.
4503624 4505918 Keep walking to him.<br />Keep walking to him.
4506002 4507086 Walk right in the middle.
4507170 4508671 - Take his heart.<br />- Take his heart.
4508755 4511090 Knock his brains out.<br />Come on, we're waiting here.
4517722 4518890 Keep going!
4520266 4523144 There's the bell for round two.<br />It's been a one-sided fight so far.
4523227 4526981 It'll take more than luck to survive this round.<br />Rocky's been hit with bombs.
4527065 4527940 Slip him a hook!
4528024 4530485 Rocky Balboa trying to stay<br />in the middle of the ring
4530568 4531986 against the big Russian.
4532070 4534113 Move down! That a baby!
4535740 4537116 Do what you gotta do!
4537200 4538368 Stay with him!
4546584 4547668 Go for it!
4547752 4551381 For all intents, Rocky Balboa<br />should be all finished tonight,
4551464 4553591 but he's fighting back ferociously.
4555468 4556803 He's getting killed out there.
4556886 4558721 Drago's best punches so far.
4558805 4562308 He's cut and he's bleeding,<br />but he's on his feet and he's on the run.
4564727 4565853 Hold on!
4567271 4568439 Hold on!
4568523 4570316 Drago! Drago!
4570400 4572860 He's cut! He's cut!
4573820 4575822 The Russian's cut,<br />and it's a bad cut,
4575905 4579325 and now it's Rocky Balboa<br />coming after Ivan Drago!
4585123 4586290 Give him more room!
4586374 4588543 Yes! Yes!
4588626 4589585 Again!
4590795 4593464 You got him! Yes! Go get him!
4596884 4600138 Balboa picking up the Russian<br />and throws him to the ground like a wrestler.
4600221 4604600 It's a gutter war,<br />no holds barred in Moscow.
4604684 4608312 Rocky may be on the receiving end so far,<br />but he's here to fight.
4610064 4612275 This is shaping up<br />to be a personal war,
4612358 4615194 and right now,<br />it's anybody's boxing match.
4624036 4626038 You cut him! You hurt him!
4626122 4629542 You see? You see?<br />He's not a machine! He's a man!
4632628 4636090 Hey, Rock. No fear.<br />Hey, Rock. No fear.
4636174 4639218 No pain. No pain.<br />Beat him with your mind.
4644557 4647143 You want it more than he does.<br />No pain!
4647477 4650480 Okay, take it to him!<br />Take it to him! Take it to him!
4668623 4670124 Get up!
4705493 4706577 It's all right.
4711165 4713834 And a good right hand<br />by Rocky Balboa!
4724804 4726138 Come on, come on!
4736232 4737316 Rocky's got him now!
4744532 4747868 You're doing fine. You're doing great.<br />You've come a mighty long way, baby.
4754417 4756502 - Crush him!<br />- Now!
4775896 4779400 - That's it! Keep going!<br />- Go, go!
4811432 4812767 Come on!
4820191 4822818 A few cheers now<br />for Rocky Balboa!
4822902 4823903 Rocky!

4953365 4955868 Listen to them, Rock.<br />They're calling your name.
4956452 4958078 - They're calling you.<br />- Your boy hurt.
4958162 4959497 We stop fight now.
4960790 4964919 You'll stop nothing. I didn't come here<br />to end this fight sitting down.
4966170 4967338 I watch closely.
4967421 4970800 Yeah, you do that.<br />Go talk to him. He's hurt too!

5000579 5003749 Drago snaps out a stiff jab,<br />and another.
5003833 5005000 Come on.
5006502 5009755 Another! Rocky taking punishment,<br />trying to get inside.
5009839 5011757 He's completely exhausted.
5016720 5018180 Get up, Rock!
5018264 5019849 - Come on, Rock!<br />- Fight!
5019932 5021517 What are you waiting for?

5031610 5032945 Come on, fight!
5044123 5046375 Balboa is chopping<br />the Russian down!
5048544 5049795 Don't stop, Rock!
5049879 5052590 Balboa throws combinations<br />of punches at the Russian.
5052673 5054508 And Drago throws<br />a hard right hand,
5054592 5056468 which stuns Rocky Balboa.
5061432 5062892 Don't go down!
5064685 5067354 You can forget technique,<br />forget strategy,
5067438 5069231 this is just a street fight.
5069315 5070941 It's a question<br />of who wants it most.
5071025 5072985 - What is he doing?<br />- He's winning.
5078240 5080492 Chop him down! Come on!
5081952 5085205 Rocko! Rocko, break his head!
5085289 5086957 Rocko, knock his head off!
5091086 5092671 Come on! Finish him!
5094924 5096383 You're gonna do it!
5096467 5098552 Yes! Don't stop!
5112524 5114610 Come on, come on.
5129083 5131835 And these people love it!
5131919 5134129 It is absolute pandemonium.
5134213 5137591 More than ever, Rocky has proven<br />himself a true champion!
5165160 5166787 When I came here tonight...
5170374 5172084 I didn't know what to expect.
5174044 5176213 I just saw a lot of people hating me.
5179258 5182344 My best friend, he once said...
5184555 5185806 "You can't change."
5190144 5191103 He died.
5194148 5199194 In here, there were two guys<br />killing each other,
5199778 5204033 but I guess that's better than 20 million.
5207578 5210080 So, what I'm trying to say is...
5212458 5214001 that if I can change...
5216712 5218213 and you can change...
5220758 5222426 everybody can change!
5225304 5226263 Thank you.
