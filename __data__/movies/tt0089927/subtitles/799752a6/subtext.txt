780823 782825 This is just<br />an exhibition bout.<br />It's kids' stuff.
782869 784871 What's the purpose?
784914 788135 I mean, what<br />at this point in your life<br />is worth getting hurt for?
788178 789919 [MUSIC PLAYING]
792356 793836 What the hell is that?
793880 795359 That's my girl.
801583 802932 Thanks, honey.
802976 804368 FEMALE VOICE:<br /><i>You're welcome.</i>
804412 805805 That's a nice song.
805848 807981 <i>It's my favorite.</i><br /><i>You're the greatest.</i>
808633 810113 <i>See you, sport.</i>
811201 812594 See you.
812637 814509 Yo, Paulie,<br />who taught it<br />to talk like that?
815553 816641 She loves me.
816685 817991 Oh.
818034 820602 [SONG CONTINUES]
823170 825607 Like I was saying,
825650 828740 I don't want this chump<br />to come over here with<br />all that hype, you know,
828784 830438 trying to make us look bad.
830481 832266 They try every other way.
832309 833963 With Rock's help, we can<br />get great media coverage.
834007 836487 We can make them<br />look bad for a change.
836531 837880 I think it's wrong.
837924 840013 No, it's never been<br />more right.
840056 841536 You're a great fighter,
841579 843407 but you've been retired<br />for nearly five years.
843451 846280 Don't you think<br />it's time to start thinking<br />about something else?
846323 848935 I mean,<br />how much can you take?<br />Either of you?
852677 854288 I'll get the coffee.
857117 860294 Look, I'm sorry.<br />I didn't mean to...
860337 861817 I just care<br />about you both. I...
867605 869390 You ever try these comics?
871174 872872 No, no.
872915 874438 Keeps your fertility.
875004 877485 Hey, Paulie.
877528 879879 ANNOUNCER:  <i>...the ring now.</i><br /><i>Rocky's holding</i><br /><i>that right hand up...</i>
879922 881837 <i>He's fighting right-handed!</i><br /><i>I don't believe it!</i>
881881 884144 APOLLO: Now,<br />this was a great fight.
884187 886755 Yeah, great. I'm gettin'<br />punchy just watching it.<br />Look at this!
886798 889453 Mama mia! What you using<br />for a chin there, Stallion?
889497 891499 [LAUGHS]
891542 892892 I shoulda slipped that one.
892935 895024 Yeah, you definitely<br />should have slipped that one.
896330 898245 Ain't it something, Stallion?
898288 900290 It's crazy how people,<br />they just care about you<br />when you're in that ring
900334 901596 and they care about you<br />when you're bleeding,
901639 903337 but once you step<br />out of that ring, Stallion,
903380 904642 it's like you're<br />ancient history.
904686 906557 Oh, go on. It ain't<br />ancient history, you know.
906601 908777 I don't see anybody asking<br />for autographs, do you? Huh?
910474 914043 Hey, Apollo,<br />can I ask you something?
915001 917481 What?
917525 919657 Well, you know,<br />this fight you're having<br />against the Russian...
919701 922356 Do you think maybe<br />it ain't against him?
924619 926969 If it's not him, Stallion,<br />then who's it against?
927013 929319 [LAUGHS]
929363 931843 Well, do you think<br />maybe it's like, uh,<br />you against you?
931887 933802 What do you think?
933845 935586 You know,<br />I think you really are<br />getting brain damaged,
935630 937501 that's what I think,<br />Stallion.
937545 940940 Maybe.<br />But, really, I'm speaking<br />the truth here, Apollo.
940983 942158 Are you?Yeah.
944421 946119 I don't think I want<br />to hear this, Stallion.
946162 948034 Oh, come on.<br />Hey, Apollo, look,
948077 949992 you were a great fighter,<br />no doubt about that,
950036 952995 but, look, we gotta<br />face the facts, too.
953039 955998 You don't want to believe it,<br />but maybe the show is over.
956042 959001 Man, that's easy<br />for you to say.<br />You're still on top.
959045 962048 But what happens<br />when you're not on top?<br />Then what, huh?
962091 963919 Where do we go, Stallion?
963963 966008 'Cause we sure as hell<br />can't be born again.
966052 968010 No, I know,<br />we can't be born again,
968054 971013 but, you know, let's face it,<br />we gotta change sometime.
971057 973581 I don't want<br />to change, man.<br />I like who I am.
973624 976410 I like who you are, too,<br />but look at that, you know?
976453 977715 You don't want<br />to believe this,
977759 979500 but that ain't us<br />up there no more, Apollo.
979543 981893 We can't do that<br />the way we did it before.
981937 986550 We're changing.<br />We're, like, turning<br />into regular people.
986594 989727 No, Stallion, maybe<br />you think you're changing,
989771 992034 but you can't change<br />what you really are.
992078 994950 And you can forget<br />all this money and stuff<br />you got all around you, man,
994994 997648 'cause it don't<br />change a thing.
997692 1001478 You and me,<br />we don't even have a choice.
1001522 1003567 See, we're born<br />with a killer instinct
1003611 1006005 that you can't just<br />turn off and on<br />like some radio.
1007397 1009051 We have to be right<br />in the middle of the action
1009095 1011010 'cause we're the warriors.
1011053 1012533 And without some challenge,
1012576 1014404 without some<br />damn war to fight,
1014448 1015840 then the warrior<br />may as well be dead,<br />Stallion.
1020497 1022151 So I'm asking you...
1023805 1025111 As a friend...
1029463 1031160 Stand by my side<br />this one last time.
1035382 1037645 You're a great talker, Apollo.
1040735 1043390 All right, but...<br />When this is over...
1046958 1049309 You know me, Stallion.
1049352 1051963 I always think<br />of something else.
1052007 1053704 That's what I'm afraid of.
1053748 1056359 All right,<br />you've got a deal there.
1056403 1058622 I feel sorry for<br />that guy, you know?
1060233 1061408 MAN 1: Apollo,<br />what made you decide
1061451 1063671 to put on an exhibition<br />fight with Drago?
1063714 1065934 APOLLO: Oh, let's call it<br />a sense of responsibility.
1065977 1068676 MAN 2: Responsibility how?
1068719 1071287 I had to teach this<br />young fellow to box,<br />American style.
1071331 1073159 [ALL LAUGHING]
1073202 1075770 Apollo, isn't Drago<br />a little inexperienced<br />to be in the same ring?
1075813 1080079 Well, you know, some folks<br />got to learn the hard way!
1080122 1082081 MAN 3: So, no quick<br />knockout prediction?
1082124 1084039 APOLLO: No, no, no.<br />I'm not angry with him.
1084083 1085954 I just want to show<br />the whole world
1085997 1089131 that Russia doesn't have<br />all the best athletes.
1089175 1092439 Rocky, how do you think<br />Apollo should fight Drago?
1092482 1094180 Well, personally,
1094223 1096660 I think the first thing<br />you'd better get Apollo<br />is a ladder.
1096704 1098967 [LAUGHTER]
1099010 1101926 Drago, how does it feel<br />to spar with the great<br />former champion?
1105147 1106583 The man's tongue<br />didn't come through customs.
1106627 1108107 [LAUGHTER]
1110370 1112894 My husband is very happy<br />to have this opportunity.
1112937 1114722 It's his dream.
1114765 1116071 MAN 4: Dream?<br />How do you mean?
1116115 1117986 In our country,<br />Apollo Creed
1118029 1120206 is well known<br />and very respected.
1120249 1122121 It could be a good victory.
1122164 1124688 Whoa. Hey,<br />wait a minute, now.<br />Wait a minute. Hold it.
1124732 1127213 Win?
1127256 1129824 You don't really think<br />you gonna whip me, do you?
1129867 1131652 Well, he didn't<br />come here to lose.
1131695 1133697 You hold on, little lady,<br />you hold on,
1133741 1136222 'cause lose,<br />and lose royally,<br />he's gonna do.
1136265 1137614 How can you be so sure?
1137658 1140139 Well, I been with the best,<br />and I've beat the best.
1140182 1143011 I've retired more men<br />than social security!
1143054 1144926 Excuse, please.
1144969 1147146 You are not very realistic,<br />are you, Mr. Creed?
1147189 1149278 Where did you come from?<br />What are you talking about?
1149322 1151454 You can box, yes,<br />but you are far too old
1151498 1153021 to think that you can<br />win over Drago.
1153064 1154196 Is that a fact?
1154240 1156851 Yes! And it could be<br />a painful one.
1156894 1158983 You put that<br />heavy bag with eyeballs<br />in the ring with me,
1159027 1160333 and you're gonna see<br />the meaning of pain.
1160376 1162030 Why do you insult us?
1162073 1164902 Now, you just hold on here.<br />Don't make me out to be<br />the bad guy.
1164946 1167427 I came here to talk about<br />a friendly exhibition bout
1167470 1169342 till Comrade Bigmouth<br />started up.
1169385 1171561 It is you<br />who are the aggressor.<br />This is obvious.
1171605 1174651 I wish to<br />say to the press,<br />in all fairness,
1174695 1176175 Drago should not even<br />fight this man,
1176218 1178220 because he is a has-been.
1178264 1180788 You get that big chump<br />in the ring right now,
1180831 1183356 and I'm gonna<br />show you what I have.
1183399 1185314 Break something!<br />Bring it on!
1185358 1188317 I don't want to hear<br />anything about hurt.<br />Just let that chump go.
1188361 1190276 [ALL YELLING]
1192103 1193888 All right, all right,<br />all right.
1193931 1196238 All right,<br />I said what I feel.
1196282 1197848 We're gonna finish this<br />in the ring.
1197892 1199763 You understand?<br />We're gonna finish<br />this in the ring.
1199807 1201809 Look, you just shut up,<br />and all these puppets<br />that you brought with you.
1201852 1204290 You history, chump!<br />You history!
1204333 1206422 How did I do? Little loud for my taste.
1206466 1208294 But good? Oh, yeah, very good.
1213603 1217477 MAN: Welcome, one and all,<br />to the city of lights,<br />Las Vegas,
1217520 1219609 and to one of the most<br />unusual events in years,
1219653 1221437 East meets West,
1221481 1224875 age versus youth<br />in a goodwill exhibition match
1224919 1227356 as the former champion<br />Apollo Creed
1227400 1229967 takes on a mountain of muscle<br />from the Soviet Union,
1230011 1232231 Ivan Drago.
1232274 1233971 APOLLO: Come on, man. ROCKY: Patience is a virtue,<br />you know?
1234015 1236235 APOLLO: I'm ready<br />to rock 'n' roll, and you<br />want to talk patience!
1236278 1238454 ROCKY: I understand,<br />but you gotta get<br />your equipment here.
1238498 1241109 There you go.<br />Now you look like a mummy.
1241152 1243242 I feel like a mummy, too. How does it feel? Okay?
1243285 1245679 Feels great.<br />I feel like I could<br />eat nails, Stallion.
1245722 1247594 You know,<br />I never tried them things.
1247637 1249204 What are you talking about?
1249248 1251075 Snails. I never had 'em,<br />you know.
1251119 1253034 I've seen 'em<br />in the garden, but I never<br />wanted to eat 'em.
1253077 1254992 I didn't say anything<br />about snails.
1255036 1257386 I said nails.<br />N-n-nails, Stallion.
1257430 1259301 Okay.
1259345 1262652 Yeah, well, you look<br />pretty good, but, you know,<br />just do me a favor.
1262696 1265438 When you go up there,<br />Apollo, try not to wear<br />yourself out, okay?
1266090 1267309 [CHUCKLES]
1267353 1269442 Yeah. Wear myself out. Sure.
1269485 1272836 Well, it's just that<br />you ain't been in the ring<br />for, like, five years,
1272880 1275012 so I just want you<br />to maintain a little bit.
1275056 1276884 What are you talking about?<br />You sound like I'm an old man.
1276927 1279539 I'm in the best<br />shape of my life.<br />I'm stronger, I'm quicker.
1279582 1282237 Well, hey, hey,<br />I'm not saying you're<br />not ready or anything,
1282281 1284718 but personally,<br />if it were me,
1284761 1287938 I wouldn't mind postponing<br />a couple of weeks.
1287982 1289418 Postpone?
1289462 1291464 Yeah. I mean,<br />come on, Apollo,
1291507 1295250 we don't know<br />anything about this guy<br />you're fighting, really.
1295294 1298906 Look, okay, okay,<br />let's say I postpone, right?
1298949 1300908 I pull out,<br />somebody else steps in<br />and whips this chump,
1300951 1302213 then where does that<br />leave me?
1302257 1304172 What do you mean<br />leave you, Apollo?
1304215 1306566 It's just some kind<br />of exhibition fight.<br />This thing don't mean nothing.
1306609 1309090 No, no, no, man.<br />That's where you're wrong.
1309133 1312354 This is not just<br />an exhibition fight<br />that doesn't mean anything.
1312398 1314791 Look, this is us against them.<br />What are you talking about?<br />Come on.
1316967 1319492 Stallion...
1319535 1322321 Maybe you don't know<br />what I'm talking about now,
1323583 1325324 but you will when it's over.
1327108 1329502 Believe me,<br />you will when it's over.
1330851 1332461 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
1340077 1341340 Ivan!
1370717 1373459 Good luck. I hope after<br />we can be friends.
1373894 1375983 I hope so.
1376026 1378377 Of course,<br />they're sportsmen,<br />not soldiers.
1382381 1383512 Enjoy the fight.

1723417 1726028 The bad blood between<br />these two can be felt<br />all over this arena.
1726072 1728030 I can't get over<br />the size of this Russian.

1775948 1778385 And a slip! A slip by Creed.
1778428 1779865 WOLF: This is bizarre.
1779908 1781997 Creed is over the hill,

1833614 1835224 It is Drago with<br />the upper hand now,

2043171 2044999 I don't know<br />if it matters now.
2046305 2049047 I guess what matters is
2049090 2050178 what he stood for,
2052659 2054269 what he lived for, and
2056184 2057968 what he died for.

2138440 2142183 Yes, of course.<br />It is a matter of science.

2376330 2379202 This house, the cars,<br />and all the stuff we got,
2379246 2380421 it ain't everything.
2383468 2386384 There's a lot more<br />than this, Adrian.
2386427 2388647 Before, there were<br />reasons to fight<br />I could understand,
2388690 2390779 but I don't understand this.
2390823 2394783 Even if you win,<br />what have you won?<br />Apollo's still gone.
2394827 2397873 Why can't you<br />change your thinking?<br />Everybody else does!
2397917 2400136 'Cause I'm a fighter.
2400180 2402965 That's the way<br />I'm made, Adrian.
2403009 2404967 That's what you married.
2405011 2406969 We can't change<br />what we are.
2407013 2409102 Yes, you can.
2409145 2410408 You can't change<br />anything, Adrian.
2410451 2413019 All we can do is<br />just go with what we are.
2413062 2414368 You can't go<br />with what you are.
2414412 2415804 Have you read the papers?
2415848 2417893 Do you know<br />what everybody says?
2417937 2419765 It's suicide!
2419808 2421680 You've seen him.<br />You know how strong he is.
2422811 2424247 You can't win!
2428687 2429949 Oh, Adrian.
2433822 2435520 Adrian always<br />tells the truth.
2437217 2438827 No, maybe I can't win.
2441221 2443397 Maybe the only thing<br />I can do
2444659 2446661 is just take<br />everything he's got.
2447706 2449969 But to beat me,
2450012 2451971 he's going to<br />have to kill me.
2452841 2455453 And to kill me,
2455496 2459892 he's gonna have<br />to have the heart<br />to stand in front of me.
2459935 2464331 And to do that,<br />he's got to be willing<br />to die himself.
2466202 2468683 I don't know if<br />he's ready to do that.
2469118 2470468 I don't know.

2792485 2795009 Well, the truth is,<br />you know, sometimes...
2796968 2799884 I do get<br />a little scared, you know.
