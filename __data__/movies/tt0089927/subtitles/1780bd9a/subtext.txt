109720 111199 MAN:<br />We made a deal.
111360 112918 ROCKY:<br />I know, but this is extremely crazy.
113120 115270 Yeah. it's mentally irregular, right?<br />Yeah.
115440 117749 It makes sense.<br />You owe me a favor.
117960 120599 I know, but when did you<br />think of this?
120800 122313 About three years ago.
122480 125278 This is very crazy, Apollo.<br />Look, Stallion.
125440 128193 When you won that last<br />fight, you won<br />by one second.
128400 131756 By one second.<br />That's hard for a man<br />of my intelligence to handle.
131920 135151 Is it? Didn't you say<br />you learned how to<br />live with it?
135360 137669 I lied.<br />Oh, you lied!
137880 140440 So now you just<br />gotta prove it<br />to yourself?
140640 143677 Just for myself.<br />No TV, no newspapers,<br />just you and me.
143880 146553 Nothing. Just you and me.<br />Age before beauty.
146760 147749 Anything you say.
147960 149951 I do all the work. Okay.
150160 153994 You better go slow,<br />because you ain't as young<br />as springtime no more.
154160 156549 I can still whip<br />your butt, Stallion.
156720 159996 Oh, yeah? How you gonna<br />do that? You taught me<br />everything you know.
160200 161553 Almost everything.
161760 166276 Remember, you fight great,<br />but I'm a great fighter. Ready?
167040 169076 Oh, absolutely.<br />All right.
169280 170315 You know, Stallion,
170800 173872 it's too bad we gotta<br />get old, huh?
174480 177199 Just keep punching,<br />Apollo.
178480 179708 Wanna ring the bell?
180440 181668 All right.
181880 183677 Ding, ding.
184880 186233 Come on, Stallion.
187360 188839 Come on,<br />come on.
189640 192712 Boy, you really move good<br />for an older guy.
192880 194996 You can fly.<br />Look out, now.
195200 197316 No, you don't want<br />any of this.

230520 232476 A little bit?<br />Where'd you get that hat?
232640 234949 A friend gave it to me.<br />Like it?
235200 237111 ROCKY JR:<br />Who punched you in the eye?
237440 238429 Same friend.
238600 241398 That's weird.<br />Better hurry, Dad.
241600 244592 You're developing a very,<br />very loud personality.

327120 329634 He looks great.<br />This is extremely psycho.
329840 332274 You don't have friends,<br />so we thought<br />you'd like it.
332480 335278 ROCKY: Pretend you're happy,<br />will you? It'll keep you company.
335480 337914 Great-looking guy.<br />SICO: Please make a wish.
338320 340038 It's creepy. That talks!
340240 343312 Creepy? I wish I had one<br />when I was growing up.
343520 344555 Go on, make a wish.
344720 346517 I wish I wasn't<br />in this nightmare.

366960 371317 SICO: Oh, don't worry.<br />I'll clean it up for you, Paulie.
376600 378909 Rocky!<br />Yeah, you noticed.
379120 380758 What are you doing<br />with that cake?
380920 383753 The party ain't over yet,<br />you know?
384560 387199 Still gotta celebrate<br />some more.<br />It's a special night.
387400 388753 Yeah, it's Wednesday.
388960 390916 It's definitely Wednesday,
391120 395830 but in case you forgot,<br />it's almost nine years<br />since you married me, so
396080 397638 here's your prize.<br />Oh.
398200 399838 But our anniversary's<br />a week away.
400040 402315 That's true,<br />but why wait?
402960 405155 Has it been that rough?<br />No.
406680 408875 I'll tell you, it's been<br />excellent, really.
409040 410871 Open your prize. Go on,<br />open your prize.
411080 412798 Okay.
415600 416874 Do you like it?
417080 418991 It's beautiful.<br />All right!
420400 422118 I was so nervous,<br />I didn't know.
422320 423548 I hope you like it.
423720 425631 The guy I bought<br />it from says:
425840 430550 "Even if it looks like a snake,<br />don't worry, because it<br />won't bite you."
431440 433317 Oh, it's beautiful.
434800 436313 You know what's amazing?
436960 441670 That after all these years,<br />everything still seems<br />kind of new.
442320 445118 Remember<br />a long time ago,<br />I told you...
445320 450030 I said that you<br />ain't never getting rid of me.<br />Remember that?
451680 454069 Well, you're not.

594480 596471 I want you to use your head<br />for something

639200 641156 As you can see,<br />it is highly advanced
641360 644432 and we wish to show<br />the American press<br />a small portion
644640 646790 of the advances<br />our country's made
646960 649030 in the technology<br />of human performance.
649200 652237 MAN: Coach Rimsky, what does all this<br />do to enhance performance?
652400 654914 Well...<br />If I may answer.
655120 658078 It makes a man a better man,
658280 662671 a great athlete, a super athlete<br />by harnessing all his strength.
662880 666839 Though most of the world<br />is ignorant in body chemistry,<br />we wish to
667600 669158 educate your country.
669360 673273 There are rumors<br />of blood doping and<br />distribution of anabolic steroids
673440 674475 in the Soviet Union.
674640 676710 Has Drago partaken in any<br />such experiments?
676880 679269 No, no. Ivan is<br />naturally trained.
679440 682352 MAN: Then how do you explain his<br />freakish strength?
682560 686314 Like your Popeye, he ate his<br />spinach every day.
688720 690358 Shall we have<br />a demonstration?
690560 691709 MAN: Please do.<br />Thank you.
692320 696359 A normal heavyweight averages<br />700 pounds of pressure
696560 698198 per square inch.
707080 708069 As you can see,
708680 712719 Drago averages 1850 pounds.
713160 714752 So the result's quite obvious.
714960 716552 And what results<br />are those?
716720 719439 Whatever he hits,<br />he destroys.
721000 722592 APOLLO:<br /><i>I saw him fight as an amateur.</i>
722800 726873 He's big and he's strong, but<br />he's clumsy. I know I can beat him.

729920 732275 Let's just say it's something<br />I believe in.
732440 735432 You can do your homework.<br />Okay. Later, Dad.

747240 749390 This is just an exhibition bout.<br />Kid stuff.

809840 811592 I mean, how much<br />can you take?
812120 813473 Either of you?
816400 818118 I'll get the coffee.
820440 823193 Look, I'm sorry.<br />I didn't mean to...

932320 934550 I like who you are too,<br />but look at that.
934760 937672 You don't wanna believe it,<br />but that ain't us up there<br />no more.
937880 941077 We can't do that the way<br />we did it before.<br />We're changing.
941280 944397 We're, like, turning into<br />regular people.
944560 947199 No, Stallion.<br />Maybe you think<br />you're changing.
947400 949470 But you can't change<br />what you really are.
949680 953958 You can forget all this<br />money and stuff.<br />It don't change a thing.
955040 958749 You and me, we don't even<br />have a choice.
958960 960712 We're born with<br />a killer instinct
960920 963559 that you can't just<br />turn off and on like a radio.
964520 967557 We have to be in the middle<br />of the action because<br />we're warriors.
968000 970833 Without some challenge,<br />without some damn war<br />to fight,
971040 974157 then the warrior<br />may as well be dead,<br />Stallion.
977200 979111 So I'm asking you,
980240 982117 as a friend,
985760 988320 stand by my side<br />this one last time.
991560 993915 You're a great talker,<br />Apollo.
996720 999553 All right, but when<br />this is over?
1002520 1004795 You know me, Stallion.
1005000 1006797 I always think<br />of something else.
1007480 1010950 That's what I'm afraid of.<br />All right, you got a deal there.
1011640 1013790 I feel sorry<br />for that guy, huh?
1014800 1018429 MAN 1: What made you decide to put<br />on an exhibition fight with Drago?
1018640 1020790 APOLLO: Let's call it<br />a sense of responsibility.
1021320 1022992 MAN 2:<br />Responsibility? How?
1023200 1026795 APOLLO: I had to teach<br />this young fellow to box,<br />American style.
1026960 1029838 Isn't Drago a little<br />inexperienced to be<br />in the same ring?
1030240 1034119 Well, you know, some folks<br />gotta learn the hard way.
1034600 1036318 MAN 3:<br />No quick knockout predictions?
1036520 1037748 APOLLO:<br />No, I'm not angry with him.
1037960 1040394 I just wanna show<br />the whole world that Russia
1040560 1042357 doesn't have<br />all the best athletes.
1042960 1045838 Rocky, how do you think<br />Apollo should fight Drago?
1046440 1051070 Personally, I think the first thing<br />you better get Apollo is a ladder.
1051680 1055559 Drago, how does it feel to spar<br />with the great former champion?
1058200 1060156 His tongue didn't come<br />through customs.
1060400 1063119 [ALL LAUGHING]
1063320 1065788 My husband is very happy<br />to have this opportunity.
1066000 1068594 It's his dream.<br />MAN 4: Dream? How do you mean?
1068880 1072589 In our country,<br />Apollo Creed is well-known<br />and very respected.
1072800 1074028 It could be a good victory.
1074200 1078159 Whoa. Hey, wait a minute, now.<br />Wait a minute. When?
1079240 1081993 You don't really think you're<br />gonna whip me, do you?
1082160 1083513 He didn't come here<br />to lose.
1083720 1085517 Hold on, little lady.<br />You hold on.
1085680 1088069 Because lose and lose royally,<br />he's gonna do.
1088240 1089275 How can you be so sure?
1089480 1091596 I've been with the best<br />and I've beat the best.
1091800 1094598 I've retired more men than<br />Social Security.
1094800 1098395 Excuse me. You are not very<br />realistic, are you, Mr. Creed?
1098600 1100431 Who are you?<br />What are you talking about?
1100640 1104269 You can box, but you are<br />too old to think that you<br />can win over Drago.
1104480 1107597 Is that a fact?<br />Yes, and it could be a painful one.
1107760 1111070 Put him in the ring<br />with me and you'll see<br />the meaning of pain.
1111280 1112713 Why do you insult us?
1112880 1114108 Now, you just hold on here.
1114320 1117835 I'm not the bad guy.<br />I came here for<br />a friendly exhibition bout
1118000 1121515 till Comrade Bigmouth started up.<br />It is you who are the aggressor.
1122040 1124634 I wish to say to the press,<br />in all fairness,
1124840 1127832 Drago should not fight<br />this man because<br />he is a has-been.
1128360 1131079 You get that big chump<br />in the ring right now.
1134400 1136152 Bring it on.<br />Stop, you'll get hurt.
1136360 1137998 Just let that chump go.
1142080 1143752 All right, all right.
1143960 1145393 I said what I feel.
1145600 1148353 We'll finish this in the ring.<br />Whatever you like.
1148560 1150790 You shut up, and all these<br />puppets you brought.
1151000 1153116 You're history, chump.<br />You history!
1153320 1155197 How did I do?<br />A little loud for me.
1155400 1157516 But good?<br />Oh, yeah. Very good.

1186960 1188552 Now you look like a mummy.
1188760 1190398 APOLLO: I feel like a mummy.<br />How's it feel?
1190560 1192755 Great. I feel like I could<br />eat nails.
1192960 1196111 I never tried them things.<br />What are you talking about?
1196320 1200029 Snails. I see them in the garden,<br />but I never wanna eat them.
1200240 1203118 I didn't say anything about snails.<br />I said "nails."
1203320 1204548 Nails!
1205680 1208069 Well, you know,<br />you look pretty good.
1208240 1210800 But do me a favor when<br />you go up there, Apollo.
1210960 1213679 Try not to wear<br />yourself out, okay?
1213880 1215598 Yeah, wear myself out.<br />Sure.
1215800 1218519 You ain't been in the ring<br />for, like, five years,

1225480 1229314 Well, hey, I'm not saying<br />you're not ready or anything.
1229520 1233638 But personally, if it<br />were me, I would postpone it<br />a couple weeks.
1233840 1235876 Postpone?<br />Yeah, I mean,
1236080 1240073 come on, Apollo. We don't know<br />anything about this guy, really.
1240640 1243916 Look, okay, okay.<br />Let's say I postpone, right?
1244120 1247112 I pull out, somebody else<br />whips him. Where does<br />that leave me?
1247280 1248349 What do you mean?
1248560 1251199 It's an exhibition fight.<br />It don't mean nothing.
1251400 1253436 No, no, no, man.<br />That's where you're wrong.

1963640 1965198 what he stood for,
1967080 1968752 what he lived for,
1970640 1972039 and what he died for.
1974960 1976871 You always did everything
1978800 1980631 the way you wanted it.
1983920 1986229 I know I didn't understand that,
1992880 1994359 but now I understand.
1999720 2001676 I'll never forget you, Apollo.
2019440 2020919 You're the best.

2031720 2033870 WOMAN 1:<br /><i>Rocky, is the decision final?</i>
2034080 2035069 ROCKY:<br /><i>Yes.</i>
2035360 2038591 MAN 1: <i>Is this the first time</i><br /><i>the champion has given up</i><br /><i>his crown?</i>
2038760 2039875 ROCKY:<br /><i>I don't know about that.</i>
2040040 2042315 MAN 2: <i>Doesn't the title mean</i><br /><i>anything to you anymore?</i>
2042480 2043549 ROCKY:<br /><i>Not until this is over.</i>
2043720 2046712 MAN 3: <i>Coach Rimsky, considering</i><br /><i>Rocky's known punching power,</i>
2046880 2049155 <i>do you still think</i><br /><i>this will be an easy fight?</i>
2049320 2051959 RIMSKY: Yes. Of course.<br />It's a matter of size
2052800 2055109 and evolution.<br />Isn't it, gentlemen?
2055280 2059193 Drago is the most perfectly<br />trained athlete ever.
2059400 2062153 This other man has not<br />the size or the endurance
2062320 2064151 or the genetics to win.
2064360 2067796 It's physically impossible<br />for this little man to win.
2068040 2071032 Drago is a look at the future.
2071240 2074277 MAN 4: How much are you making<br />for this fight?
2075240 2077196 No money.<br />It's not about money.
2077360 2079351 WOMAN 2:<br />Has the fight date been set yet?
2079560 2081835 December 25th.<br />MAN 5: Why Christmas?
2082040 2083473 ROCKY: That's what I was told.<br />WOMAN 3: Where?
2084560 2086630 It's in Russia.<br />Are you nuts?
2086800 2089155 MAN 6: Rocky, what's going on?<br />MAN 7: Why'd you agree to this?
2089320 2092517 We fight in Soviet Union<br />or we fight nowhere.
2092760 2096673 Why don't you ask Drago's<br />wife why she is afraid.<br />Tell them, please.
2096880 2100509 I'm afraid for my husband's life.<br />We have violent threats<br />everywhere.
2100760 2102637 ALL:<br />Aww...
2102960 2104234 We are not politics.
2104400 2107870 All I want is for<br />my husband to be safe,<br />to be treated fairly.
2108800 2109915 You call him a killer.
2110120 2113078 He's a professional fighter,<br />not a killer.
2113280 2115555 You have this belief<br />that you are better than us.
2115760 2120390 You have this belief<br />that this country is so very good<br />and we so very bad.
2120760 2124719 You have this belief that you are<br />so fair and we are so very cruel.
2124880 2126472 It's lies and false propaganda
2126640 2130633 to support this antagonistic<br />and violent government.
2130920 2132399 Oh, violent?
2132560 2135711 We don't keep our people<br />behind a wall with machine guns.
2135920 2138036 Who are you?<br />Who am I?
2138240 2140879 I'm the unsilent majority,<br />bigmouth.
2141040 2143793 RIMSKY: Good. Yes, good.<br />Insult us.
2144000 2147629 It's more typical rude behavior<br />toward visiting foreigners.
2147880 2152078 But perhaps this simple defeat<br />of this little so-called champion
2152240 2154390 will be a perfect example
2154600 2157876 of how pathetically weak<br />your society has become.
2158080 2159069 We go!
2162560 2165552 MAN 8: Rocky, can you tell us<br />about the training program?
2167600 2168999 REPORTERS:<br />Mrs. Balboa.
2170600 2172795 REPORTER 1: How do you feel<br />about going to Russia?
2173960 2177191 How is it to be a part<br />of such a controversial<br />decision?
2178760 2181354 REPORTER 2:<br />Did Creed's death make up his mind?
2181520 2182714 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
2182920 2184239 Why is he going at Christmas?
2184840 2186068 REPORTER 3:<br />Was it his decision?
2186280 2188271 When will you be<br />going to Russia?
2188520 2191717 Look, I'm not going to Russia.<br />I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
2191920 2195435 I don't know why you're here.<br />I don't know what<br />you're doing here.
2195600 2197272 REPORTER 4:<br />What is your position?
2200240 2202879 [CAR ENGINE REVVING]
2221280 2224477 ADRIAN: Rocky?<br />ROCKY: Yeah.
2228040 2229268 You all right?
2229720 2231915 Yeah. Fine.
2232600 2234033 Why did you do it?
2237360 2239078 I just gotta do<br />what I gotta do.
2239280 2240952 You don't have<br />to do anything.
2244240 2246231 No, Adrian, I do, and
2248080 2250036 I gotta leave this place too.
2250320 2252038 So where are you going?
2252720 2255439 They said they were gonna<br />let me train in Russia,
2256360 2258669 and I just wanna<br />go someplace where
2258920 2261150 I ain't gonna think<br />about nothing except him.
2261320 2263754 Rocky, give it some time.
2263920 2266354 Don't do this.<br />A lot of people<br />live with hurt.
2267480 2270199 A lot of people<br />don't have a choice. I do.
2270400 2272834 And for that you're willing<br />to lose everything?
2273640 2275676 Adrian, this ain't everything.
2277160 2280072 This house and the cars<br />and all the stuff we got,
2280240 2281719 that ain't everything.
2284320 2286436 There's a lot more<br />than this, Adrian.
2286600 2289194 Before there were<br />reasons to fight<br />I could understand,
2289360 2290793 but I don't understand this.
2290960 2294157 Even if you win,<br />what have you won?<br />Apollo's still gone.
2295080 2298072 Why can't you change<br />your thinking?<br />Everybody else does.
2298280 2299679 Because I'm a fighter.
2300400 2302516 That's the way<br />I'm made, Adrian.
2303080 2304718 That's what you married.
2304920 2306638 We can't change what we are.
2306800 2307994 Yes, you can.
2308640 2312394 You can't change anything,<br />all we can do is go<br />with what we are.
2312560 2315233 Go with what you are!<br />Have you read the papers?
2315440 2317237 Do you know<br />what everybody says?
2317440 2319032 It's suicide.
2319240 2321549 You've seen him,<br />you know how strong he is.
2322120 2323314 You can't win!
2327800 2329518 Adrian.
2332400 2334868 Adrian always tells<br />the truth.
2335680 2337636 No, maybe I can't win.
2339680 2341830 Maybe the only thing<br />I can do
2342840 2344910 is just take everything<br />he's got.
2346040 2347314 But to beat me,
2348120 2349633 he's gonna have to kill me.
2350880 2352359 And to kill me,
2353080 2356277 he's gonna have to have<br />the heart to stand in front of me.
2357640 2359232 And to do that,
2359960 2362076 he's gotta be willing<br />to die himself.
2363600 2365989 I don't know if he's<br />ready to do that.
2366720 2367948 I don't know.
2371640 2373073 I don't know.
2378440 2381273 [###]
2635920 2639754 SICO: Be careful<br />with those plaid ones.<br />They belong to the boss.
2640280 2644398 Paulie, did you pack<br />your toothbrush? You know<br />tobacco stains your teeth.
2644600 2646352 If I've told you once,<br />I've told you a thousand times...
2646520 2649830 Hey. Stop busting my chops.
2650000 2651149 SICO:<br />Paulie.
2651440 2653635 I'm gonna have her wires tied<br />when I get back.
2656000 2657956 When will you be back?
2658600 2661353 Oh, pretty soon.<br />Are you scared?
2662320 2664390 No.<br />Yes, you are.
2664600 2666238 A little, maybe?
2666640 2667868 Well, wouldn't you be?
2668440 2672831 If a big giant man wanted<br />to beat me up, I'd be real scared.
2676600 2679273 Well, the truth is, you know,<br />sometimes...
2680800 2682631 I do get a little scared.
2683640 2686837 When I'm in that ring<br />and I'm really<br />getting hit on
2687040 2689759 and my arms hurt so much<br />I can't even lift them,
2690160 2694278 and I'm thinking, "I wish this<br />guy would hit me on the chin
2694480 2696436 so I don't feel<br />nothing anymore."
2698120 2702352 Then there's another side<br />that comes out that<br />isn't so scared.
2702680 2704716 There's another side that,<br />like...
2706240 2707559 wants to take more,
2708240 2711437 that wants to go<br />that one more round because
2711680 2715992 by going that one more round<br />when you don't think you can,
2716760 2719479 it's what makes all<br />the difference in your life.
2720120 2721473 Do you know<br />what I mean?
2722920 2724751 I want you to remember<br />one more thing.
2726080 2727433 Remember that
2727920 2730832 Daddy thinks you're<br />the best boy in the world.
2731360 2734477 That Daddy loves you,<br />no matter what.
2743680 2745113 I gotta go now.
2745920 2748832 You gonna take care of everything?<br />Okay.
2749320 2751151 And don't forget to feed<br />your robot.
2753560 2754629 Bye, baby.
2756600 2758033 Good luck.
2759040 2760189 Thanks.
2761440 2763510 Come on,<br />the meter's running.
2764160 2766151 [###]
2784400 2786391 [###]
2834240 2836151 What a horrendous flight.
2836400 2839915 This is Russia?<br />It don't look so tough, Rock.
2840200 2843510 [###]
2864400 2866152 Mr. Balboa.
2866320 2867799 [SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN]
2867960 2869712 We take you<br />to quarters now.
2871000 2874959 Hey, when does the sun come up?<br />This is detrimental to my sinuses.
2875720 2879110 Weather changes<br />hour to hour.<br />Get used to it.
2880200 2881394 Get in car now.
2881600 2883750 We have very long trip.
2884000 2886309 Sounds like Dracula's cousin.<br />Come on, Paulie.
