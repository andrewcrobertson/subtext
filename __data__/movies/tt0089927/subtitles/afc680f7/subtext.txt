117051 118985 I know, but this is extremely crazy.
119053 120987 Yeah, it's mentally irregular, right?
121055 122989 But it makes all the sense in<br />the world.
123057 124591 You owe me a favor.
124659 127427 I know,<br />but when did you think of this?
127494 129162 About 3 years ago.
129229 131164 Oh, this is very encouraging, Apollo.
131231 134133 Look, Stallion,<br />when you won that last fight,
134201 135501 you won by one second.
135570 137003 You beat me by one second.<br />One second!
137071 139005 That's very hard for a man of<br />my intelligence to handle.
139073 140840 Didn't you say after I beat you
140908 142508 you learned how to live with it?
142577 143509 I lied.
143578 144711 Oh, you lied?
144779 148514 Oh, so now you just got<br />to prove it to yourself?
148583 151384 Just myself.. No TV, no newspapers.<br />Just you and me.
151452 154520 Naturally. Just you and me.<br />Age before beauty.
154589 155789 Anything you say, Stallion.
155856 157824 I do all the work? Okay.
157892 159960 I'll tell you, Apollo,<br />you better go slow,
160027 162195 because you ain't as young<br />as springtime no more.
162262 164798 I'm still young enough to<br />whip your butt, Stallion.
164865 166866 Oh, yeah?<br />How you going to do that?
166934 168367 You taught me everything you know.
168435 169970 Almost everything.
170037 172472 You got to remember now,<br />you fight great,
172539 174874 but I'm a great fighter.
174942 176309 You ready?
176376 177477 Absolutely.
177544 179145 You know, Stallion,
179213 182983 it's too bad we got to get<br />old, huh?
183050 185184 Just keep punching, Apollo.
185252 188855 You want to ring the bell?
188923 191024 All right.
191092 193760 Ding ding.
193828 196029 Come on, Stallion.
196097 198698 Come on, come on.
198766 202736 Boy, you really move good<br />for an older guy.
202803 203737 Look at him fly.
203804 204904 Look out now.
204972 207306 You don't want any of this.<br />Come on.
207374 212478 Maybe I'm in here<br />with the wrong guy.
231848 233783 Dad, you're late.
233850 236152 Mom's gonna yell at you.
236220 237653 How you doin'?
237721 238688 Fine.
238755 240690 Don't you think that's a<br />little bright?
240757 241691 Don't you think?
241758 243826 Where'd you get that hat?
243894 246496 Ah, a friend gave it to me.<br />Like it?
246564 249332 Who punched you in the eye?
249400 250833 Same friend.
250901 253269 That's weird.<br />Better hurry, Dad.
253337 254337 You know, you're developing
254405 256606 a very, very loud personality.
256673 258408 Don't go too fast,
258476 260176 or you're going to get out of focus.
260244 261511 Oh, really?
261579 262912 Whooaah!
267485 268684 Yo!
268752 269719 Yo!<br />It's about time.
269786 271488 I'm sorry I'm late.

272556 273556 and get ready to eat, okay?
273624 275558 Great. You're here.
275626 277127 Now you can stop calling him names.
277194 279362 Oh, you been calling me names, huh?
279430 280363 Well, we wait any longer,
280431 282064 then I'll be ready for the<br />next birthday.
282133 283065 Where have you been?
283134 284400 Oh, getting punched.
284468 286136 Look, why don't you<br />bring the cake in here,
286203 288070 and we can get this<br />celebration underway.
288139 289606 Boy, am I hungry.
289673 290740 Hey, Baby,<br />why don't you get the cake?
290807 291741 I think he'll love it.
291808 292742 I got a great surprise for you.
292809 294344 You're going to love this<br />cake, okay?
294411 296846 You're going to love your<br />present, Uncle Paulie!
296913 298014 Uh, let me set the mood here.
298081 300216 I got to turn the lights<br />down and everything.
300284 301217 Watch this.
301285 303119 Is it parked outside in the driveway?
303187 305855 Just be patient, would you?
305922 308824 I'm so excited<br />I'm starting to sweat,
308892 311961 like I'm getting ready to go<br />into a big fight or something.
323641 325741 Happy Birthday, Paulie!
335219 336886 What the hell is this?
336953 338120 Your present.
338189 340923 I wanted a sports car for my birthday,
340991 342425 not no walking trash can.
342493 344260 Aw, come on, he looks great here.
344327 345695 This is extremely psycho, Rocko.
345763 346696 Since you don't have any friends,
346764 347930 we thought you'd like it.
347998 349231 Yeah, pretend you're happy,<br />will you?
349299 350933 It'll keep you company<br />when you're all alone.
351001 352568 That's a great looking guy.
352636 353803 Please, make a wish.
353871 356105 It's creepy!<br />It talks, that thing.
356173 357439 Creepy?<br />These things are great!
357507 359142 I wish I had one of these<br />when I was growing up.
359209 360843 Go on. Make a wish, like he said.
360911 362845 I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.
362913 364480 Hey, very classy wish.
364548 366015 Very nice.<br />What do you think there?
367084 368484 Very good, huh?

391975 393409 Ta da!
393477 394910 Rocky.
394978 396912 Yeah, you noticed.
396980 398147 What are you doing with that cake?
398215 401917 Well, uh, the party<br />ain't over yet, you know?
401985 404087 We still got to celebrate<br />some more.
404154 405488 It's a special night.
405556 406922 Yeah, it's Wednesday.
406990 408324 Ah, it's definitely Wednesday,
408392 410259 but in case you forgot,
410327 413429 it's almost been 9 years<br />since you been married to me.
413497 415431 So here's your prize.
415499 418434 Ah.<br />But our anniversary's a week away.
418502 421003 That's true, but why wait?
421071 423606 Has it been that rough?
423673 425208 No, no.
425275 427943 I'll tell you, it's been excellent.
428011 429112 Open your prize.
429179 430946 Go on. Open your prize.
433850 435784 You like it?
435852 437052 It's beautiful.
437121 438454 All right.
438522 440623 I was so nervous.
440690 443159 I didn't know.<br />I hope you like it.
443227 445328 The guy I bought it from says...
445395 447463 Even if it looks like a snake,
447531 450566 don't worry because it won't<br />bite you.
450634 453402 Oh, it's beautiful.
453470 455471 You know what's amazing?
455539 458241 That after all these years,
458308 461477 everything still seems<br />kind of new.
461545 464480 You remember a long time ago
464548 466815 I told you that..
466883 470119 I said that you ain't<br />never getting rid of me?
470187 471820 Remember that?
471888 473822 Well, you're not.
473890 477160 You're never getting rid of me.

540123 542058 Today, the Soviet Union
542125 544393 has officially entered<br />professional boxing.
544461 545461 My husband,
545528 546929 and great undefeated Heavyweight
546997 548597 World Amateur Champion
548665 550432 Captain Ivan Drago,
550500 552735 has come here with his<br />trainers to America
552802 555404 to compete as an<br />international sportsman
555472 557273 and ambassador of goodwill.
557341 559842 Has Drago ever boxed<br />against a real professional?
559910 562511 From having been trained in Russia
562579 564446 by great boxing coach<br />Manuel Vega
564514 567083 and now by Sergei rimsky,
567150 568951 we hope he's qualified to do so.
569019 570019 Hope?
570087 572188 Well, I know he is,
572256 574156 but I don't want<br />to sound too confident.
574224 577293 If possible, we would like<br />to have an exhibition bout
577361 579628 with your famous Champion<br />Rocky Balboa.
579696 581163 What makes you think<br />he can stand the pressure
581231 583766 of fighting someone<br />as seasoned as Balboa?
583833 584967 There is no one who can<br />match his strength,
585035 587469 his endurance, or his aggressiveness.
587537 590139 You make it sound like he's indestructible.
590207 591790 Yes, he is.
591859 594060 Well, can this mammoth Russian
594127 596062 who's already been nicknamed<br />the Siberian Express
596129 598630 wreak havoc among the<br />professional heavyweight ranks?
598698 602568 Whoever he fights first,<br />it'll be one hot ticket.
602635 603903 We'll be right back
603971 606438 with a check on today's pro<br />football sports scoreboard.
608024 609959 Dad, when can I learn to fight?
610026 611094 I can't hear you.<br />What?

658509 661544 I'm just getting dizzy.
663514 665080 My husband and I thank you
665149 666782 for coming to our training<br />quarter today.
666850 670019 As you can see, it is highly advanced,
670086 672388 and we wish to show<br />the American Press
672456 675891 a small portion of the<br />advances our country's made
675959 678628 in the technology of human performance.
678695 681631 Coach Rimsky, what does all<br />this do to enhance performance?
681698 684400 Well.. If I may answer,
684468 687637 it makes a man a better man,
687704 690105 a great athlete a super athlete
690174 692475 by harnessing all his strength.
692543 693543 Though most of the world
693610 695978 is ignorant in body chemistry,
696046 699248 we wish to educate your country.
699316 701784 There have been rumors of blood<br />doping and widespread distribution
701851 704887 of anabolic steroids<br />in the Soviet Union.
704954 707156 Has Drago partaken<br />in any such experiments?
707224 709825 No, no. Ivan is naturally trained.
709893 713062 Then how do you explain<br />his freakish strength?
713129 716566 Like your Popeye,<br />he ate his spinach every day.
719603 721337 Shall we have a demonstration?
721405 722771 Please do.
722839 725474 A normal heavyweight averages
725542 730145 700 pounds of pressure<br />per square inch.
738622 744694 As you can see,<br />Drago averages 1,850 pounds.
744761 746795 So the result's quite obvious.
746863 748664 And what results are those?
748732 751800 Whatever he hits, he destroys.
753503 755070 I saw him fight when he was<br />an amateur.
755138 757673 He's big, and he's strong,<br />but he's clumsy.
757741 760476 I know I can beat him.
760544 761777 Why do you want to fight again?
761845 764213 Let's just say it's something<br />I believe in.
764281 767116 You can do your homework.

775525 777493 whack this bum out first?
777561 780796 Yeah, yeah, and he will<br />when it's for real.
780864 782898 This is just an exhibition bout.<br />It's kid's stuff.
782966 784300 What's the purpose?

859042 862144 I just care about you both.
867216 870419 You ever try these comics?
870486 872220 No, no.
872288 873923 Keeps your fertility.
873990 876659 Hey, Paulie.
876726 877860 The ring now.
877928 880596 Rocky's holding that right hand...
880663 883699 Now this was a great fight.
883767 885101 Great?<br />I'm getting punchy
885168 886602 just watching it.<br />Look at this.
886669 889404 Mamma Mia, what you using<br />for a chin there, Stallion?
891174 892307 I should have slipped that one.
892375 894509 Yeah, you definitely<br />should've slipped that one.
894577 895811 Rocky! Rocky!
895879 897379 You know something, Stallion?
897447 899281 It's crazy how people<br />just care about you
899349 900382 when you're in that ring,
900450 901617 and they care about you<br />when you're bleeding,
901684 903152 but once you step out that ringside,
903220 904954 it's like you're ancient history.
905021 906388 Aw, come on.
906456 909024 I don't see anybody asking<br />for autographs, do you, huh?
910026 911961 Hey, Apollo,
912028 914463 can I ask you something?
914530 916331 What?
916399 918868 Well, this fight you're<br />having against the Russian,
918935 922704 do you think maybe<br />it ain't against him?
922773 925440 If it's not him, Stallion,
925508 928110 then who's it against?
928178 930412 Do you think maybe it's, like, uh,
930480 932681 you against you?<br />What do you think?
932749 935417 You know, I think you really<br />are getting brain damage.
935485 936652 That's what I think, Stallion.
936719 938287 Yeah, maybe, but, uh..
938354 940956 really, I'm speaking<br />the truth here, Pal.
941024 942792 Are you?
942859 946361 I don't think I want<br />to hear this, Stallion.
946429 947696 Come on, Apollo, look.
947764 949899 You were a great fighter..<br />No doubt about that..
949966 952868 But, look,<br />we got to face the facts, too.
952936 955404 You don't want to believe it,<br />but maybe the show is over.
955471 957006 That's easy for you to say.
957073 958874 You're still on top.
958942 960309 What happens when you're not<br />on top?
960376 961911 Then what?
961978 963679 Where do we go, Stallion?
963746 965614 Because we sure as hell<br />can't be born again.
965682 967316 No, I know we can't be born again,
967383 968317 but, you know, let's face it.
968384 970820 We got to change sometime.
970887 973422 I don't want to change, Man!<br />I like who I am!
973489 976225 I like who you are, too,<br />but look at that, you know?
976293 977226 You don't want to believe this,
977294 979995 but that ain't us<br />up there no more, Pal.
980063 981563 We can't do that the way we<br />did it before.
981631 982898 We're.. We're changing.
982966 986202 We're, like,<br />turning into regular people.
986269 987203 No, Stallion!
987270 989371 Maybe you think you're changing,
989439 991406 but you can't change<br />what you really are.
991474 993075 And you can forget all this money
993143 994910 and stuff you got all around<br />you, Man,
994978 997746 because it don't change a thing.
997814 1001217 You and me,<br />we don't even have a choice.
1001284 1002784 See, we're born with a killer instinct
1002853 1004619 that you can't just turn off<br />and on
1004687 1006255 like some.. Some radio.
1006323 1009024 We have to be right in the<br />middle of the action,
1009092 1010392 because we're the warriors.
1010460 1012594 And without some..<br />Some challenge,
1012662 1013963 without some damn war to fight,
1014030 1016365 then the warriors may as<br />well be dead, Stallion.
1020737 1023739 I'm asking you...
1023806 1025074 As a friend.
1029379 1031380 Stand by my side this one<br />last time.
1035051 1038020 You're a great talker, Apollo.
1039923 1043692 All right, but when this is over...
1046429 1048864 You know me, Stallion.
1048932 1051633 Always think of something else.
1051701 1053102 That's what I'm afraid of.
1053169 1056372 All right, you got a deal there.
1056439 1059141 Feel sorry for that guy, huh?
1059209 1061443 Apollo, what made you decide
1061510 1063445 to put on an exhibition<br />fight with Drago?
1063513 1065914 Oh, let's call it a sense of responsibility.
1065982 1068250 Responsibility how?
1068317 1072087 I have to teach this young<br />fellow to box American style.
1072154 1075290 Isn't Drago a little inexperienced<br />to be in the same ring?
1075358 1079027 Well, you know, some folks<br />got to learn the hard way.
1079095 1081497 No quick knockout prediction?
1081564 1083699 No, no, no.<br />I'm not angry with him.
1083767 1085967 See, I just want to show<br />the whole world
1086035 1089671 that Russia doesn't have<br />all the best athletes.
1089739 1092007 Rocky, how do you think<br />Apollo should fight Drago?
1092074 1094042 Well, personally,
1094110 1096512 I think the first thing you<br />better get Apollo is a ladder.
1096579 1100081 Drago, how does it feel to spar
1100149 1102284 with the great Former Champion?
1104287 1107088 The man's tongue<br />didn't come through customs.
1108925 1110025 Great Champ he is!
1110092 1112828 My husband is very happy<br />to have this opportunity.
1112896 1114663 It's his dream.
1114731 1115731 Dream?<br />How do you mean?
1115799 1118333 In our country,<br />Apollo Creed is well known
1118401 1119935 and very respected.
1120002 1121369 It would be a good victory.
1121438 1122538 Whoa.
1122605 1124540 Hey, wait a minute, now.<br />Wait a minute. Hold it.
1124607 1125707 Win?
1125775 1127709 You don't really think
1127777 1129711 you're going to whip me, do you?
1129779 1131313 Drago didn't come here to lose.
1131380 1133214 You hold on, Little Lady.<br />You hold on,
1133282 1136117 because lose and lose<br />royally he's going to do.
1136185 1137319 How can you be so sure?
1137386 1138821 Well, I've been with the best,
1138888 1140055 and I beat the best.
1140122 1142858 I've retired more men<br />than Social Security.
1142926 1144392 Excuse, please.
1144461 1146862 You are not very realistic,<br />are you, Mr. Creed?
1146930 1147896 Where did you come from?
1147964 1148931 What are you talking about?
1148998 1150065 You can box, yes,
1150132 1151266 but you are far too old
1151334 1152935 to think that you can win<br />over Drago.
1153002 1154035 Is that a fact?
1154103 1156404 Yes, and it could be<br />a painful one.
1156473 1158507 You put that heavy bag with<br />eyeballs in the ring with me,
1158575 1160476 and you going to see<br />the meaning of pain.
1160543 1161743 Why do you insult us?
1161811 1162911 Now you just hold on here.
1162979 1164847 Don't make me out<br />to be the bad guy.
1164914 1166414 I came here to talk about a<br />friendly exhibition bout,
1166483 1168383 till Comrade Big Mouth<br />started up!
1168451 1170051 It is you who are the aggressor!
1170119 1171252 This is obvious.
1171320 1172955 I wish to say to the press,
1173022 1174322 in all fairness,
1174390 1175858 Drago should not<br />even fight this man
1175925 1177593 because he is a has been.
1177660 1181262 You get that big chump<br />in the ring right now!
1181330 1183932 I'll show you a has been!
1184000 1186835 I don't want to hear<br />nothing about hurt.
1186903 1188837 Just let that chump go!
1191741 1193074 All right, all right.
1193142 1195110 All right, I said what I feel.
1195177 1197012 We'll finish this in the ring.<br />You understand?
1197079 1198947 Wherever you like.
1199015 1200148 Look, you just shut up!
1200216 1201483 And all those puppets that<br />you brought with you!
1201551 1202484 You're history, Chump!
1202552 1203886 You history!
1203953 1204920 How did I do?
1204988 1205921 A little loud for my taste.
1205989 1206922 But good?
1206990 1208657 Oh, yeah, very good.
1212011 1216615 Welcome, one and all to the<br />City of Lights, Las Vegas,
1216683 1218633 and to one of the most<br />unusual events in years..
1218701 1220769 East meets West,
1220837 1224706 age versus youth in<br />a good will exhibition match,
1224774 1226875 as the Former Champion,<br />Apollo Creed,
1226943 1229544 takes on a mountain of muscle<br />from the Soviet Union,
1229612 1231997 Ivan Drago.
1233599 1235600 Yeah, I'm ready to rock and roll.
1235668 1237569 You got to get your equipment here.
1237636 1240339 There you go.<br />Now you look like a mummy.
1240406 1242274 How does it feel?
1242342 1245243 It feels great.<br />I feel like I could eat nails.
1245311 1247112 You know, I never tried them things.
1247180 1248746 What are you talking about?
1248814 1250148 Snails.<br />I never had them.
1250216 1251649 You know, I seen them in the garden,
1251717 1252717 but I didn't want to eat them.
1252785 1254619 I didn't say anything about snails!
1254687 1256621 I said nails.
1256689 1258457 N-n-nails, Stallion.
1258524 1262927 You look pretty good,<br />but just do me a favor.
1262996 1264429 When you go up there, Apollo,
1264497 1265964 try not to wear yourself out.
1266032 1267932 Yeah, wear myself out.
1268001 1269134 Sure.
1269202 1271736 It's just that you<br />ain't been in the ring
1271804 1272871 for, like, 5 years.
1272938 1274139 What are you talking about?
1274207 1276074 You sound like I'm not an old man.
1276142 1277742 I'm in the best shape of my life.
1277810 1279144 I'm stronger, I'm quicker.
1279212 1282014 Hey, I'm not saying<br />you're not ready or anything,
1282081 1284516 but personally, if it were me,
1284583 1287852 I wouldn't mind postponing<br />it a couple weeks.
1287920 1290188 Postpone?
1290256 1292624 Come on, Apollo.<br />We don't know anything
1292691 1294559 about this guy you're<br />fighting, really.
1294627 1296761 Look, okay, okay,<br />let's say I postpone.
1296829 1298663 I pull out,<br />somebody else steps in
1298731 1300165 and whips this chump.
1300233 1301933 Then where does that leave me?
1302001 1303201 What do mean "Leave you," Apollo?
1303269 1304769 It's just some kind<br />of exhibition fight.
1304837 1306138 This thing don't mean nothing.
1306205 1308040 No, no, Man,<br />that's where you're wrong!
1308107 1310042 This is not just<br />an exhibition fight
1310109 1312044 that doesn't mean anything.
1312111 1314146 This is us against them.
1314213 1316648 What are you talking about?<br />Come on.
1316715 1318417 Stallion,
1318484 1320652 maybe you don't know
1320719 1323021 what I'm talking about now,
1323089 1326458 but you will when it's over.
1326526 1328493 Believe me,
1328561 1330462 you will when it's over.
1330530 1333331 (Russian)
1339238 1340805 Ivan!
1370236 1373705 Good luck.<br />I hope after we can be friends.
1373772 1374973 I hope so.
1375040 1379244 Of course.<br />They're sportsmen, not soldiers.
1382181 1384282 Enjoy the fight.

1613212 1614513 Excuse me, would you?

1672204 1674372 and Undefeated World Amateur Champion
1674440 1676307 from the Soviet Union...
1676375 1678342 Boo!<br />Boo!
1678410 1680979 The Siberian Bull,
1681047 1683314 Ivan Drago.
1683382 1685383 Boo!
1685451 1686851 Boo!
1686919 1689287 I want you!
1689354 1691556 I want you!<br />I want you!
1691624 1693491 Now the 2 fighters come to<br />the center of the ring
1693559 1695493 for the instructions<br />from referee Lou Filippo.
1695561 1697862 You boys know the rules.
1697930 1699931 Watch your low blows,
1699999 1701132 kidney punches, rabbit punches.
1701200 1702133 In case of a knockdown,
1702201 1703434 you go to the corner I tell<br />you to,
1703502 1705804 and you stay there until<br />I tell you to come out.
1705871 1707839 Shake hands.<br />Let's have a good fight.
1707907 1710575 All right,<br />it's time to go to school.
1710643 1712477 Come on, get your hands up, Man.
1712544 1715413 You need an interpreter?<br />It's time to go to school.
1715481 1717315 You will lose.
1720753 1722386 All right!
1722454 1725556 The bad blood between these two<br />can be felt all over this arena.
1725625 1730294 I can't get over the size of<br />this Russian.
1730362 1732130 Come on, Apollo!
1732197 1735199 It's show time!<br />It's show time!
1735267 1737235 Excuse me. Didn't you forget something?
1737302 1739203 Oh. Come on.
1739271 1741272 Apollo seems to be<br />in great spirits tonight.
1741340 1745710 He's really putting on a show<br />for this capacity crowd.
1745778 1747311 Be back in a minute, all right?
1749114 1751449 Round 1.
1751517 1754419 Creed dancing around,
1754486 1756454 Creed back pedaling now.
1756522 1758623 Don't wait on him.
1758691 1760291 Draw first.
1760359 1761959 Look alive.
1762027 1763428 Come on.
1763495 1766464 (Russian)
1766532 1767699 Come on, Chump.
1767766 1769300 Neither fighter ready to<br />throw a punch.
1769368 1770468 The left jab there.
1770536 1773671 A left jab once again by Creed.
1776141 1778142 And a slip.. A slip by Creed.
1778210 1779644 This is bizarre.
1779712 1782079 Creed is over the hill,
1782147 1784615 and the Russian hasn't fought anybody.
1787653 1789520 Come on, Apollo!
1793492 1794892 Keep moving, Apollo.<br />Stick him!
1794960 1796527 Drago is moving in again.
1796595 1797795 A left hand by Creed.
1797863 1800064 Another left hand by Creed,<br />and Drago moves away.
1800131 1801632 Come on.
1803201 1806103 Get your hands up!
1808039 1811342 Another left hand by Creed.<br />Drago, waiting, waiting.
1811410 1813210 Cocking that right hand.
1813278 1815112 (Russian)
1815180 1818850 A crunching right...
1818917 1820451 Get out of there!
1820519 1821819 Get out!
1821887 1824489 And a left hand.<br />He's taking some punishment now!
1824556 1826123 Drago moves him against the ropes!
1826191 1828659 Tie him up now!
1828727 1831996 And now the Russian<br />throws Creed across the ring.
1832063 1835132 It's Drago with the upper hand.
1835200 1837001 Drago with a left to the midsection.
1837068 1838202 Get out of that corner!
1838270 1839970 Drago with a right hand.
1840038 1841873 Another right, another right.
1843642 1846811 The bell's sounded.<br />Creed's against the ropes.
1846879 1850014 What's the matter with you guys?
1850081 1851549 What are you guys doing?
1851617 1854218 This is supposed to be an exhibition!
1854286 1855820 You understand?<br />An exhibition!
1855888 1858656 A tremendous end to the<br />first round by the Russian
1858724 1863661 and a very bloody Apollo Creed.
1863729 1865963 The Soviet's strength is incredible.
1866031 1868065 I got to stop it.
1868133 1870468 This fight's finished.<br />I got to call it.
1870536 1872470 You can't do no more out there.
1872538 1873538 I'm here to fight.
1873605 1875440 He's killing you.<br />I got to stop this thing.
1875507 1878576 Promise me you're not<br />going to stop this fight.
1878644 1879944 Boy, I'll tell you something,
1880011 1882246 that was a pulverizing<br />round for the Ex-Champion.
1882314 1886050 Hey, Folks, Ivan Drago<br />is definitely for real.
1886117 1887485 Apollo!
1887553 1890888 Don't stop this fight,<br />no matter what.
1895126 1897361 No matter what.
1897429 1899163 Apollo!
1899230 1900665 Apollo!
1900732 1902500 Apollo!
1902568 1903668 Apollo!
1905303 1908072 Creed comes out for round 2,<br />dancing around.
1908140 1911075 The legs appear to be<br />still a little rubbery.
1911143 1913678 Keep your hands up.
1913745 1914879 Hands up!
1914947 1917548 And now it is the Russian<br />just standing there.
1917616 1919517 The Russian trying<br />to intimidate Creed.
1921320 1924622 And the Russian throws<br />the right hand!
1924690 1926024 Another right.
1926091 1927959 Get out of the corner!
1928027 1928960 Drago!
1929028 1932496 Get out of the corner!
1932564 1934598 Creed is being pounded<br />without mercy.
1934666 1936201 Stop the fight!
1936268 1938169 The referee tries to step in,
1938237 1939170 and he's thrown across the ring.
1939238 1941806 Throw the towel!
1941874 1946811 I have never seen Apollo<br />take so much punishment.
1946879 1949147 Throw the damn towel!
1954987 1956354 No!
1967599 1968733 My God!
1968800 1970768 Creed is down.
1970836 1972737 Apollo is down.
1972804 1974772 And he could be badly hurt.
1974840 1976207 Let him breathe!
1976275 1977208 Move!
1977276 1979244 Get everyone out of here!
1979311 1980544 The winner, Ivan Drago.
1980612 1982981 Let me through!<br />Apollo!
1983048 1985449 I cannot be defeated.
1985517 1987185 Somebody get a doctor in here!
1987253 1989954 There is no movement by Creed.
1990022 1991622 I'll defeat all.
1991690 1993057 Is he dead?
1993993 1995927 It's absolute pandemonium.
1995995 1996928 Move!
1996996 1998462 Apollo!
1998530 2000698 You can do it.
2000766 2002800 I defeat real champion.
2002868 2005069 Where's the stretcher?
2005137 2006470 Let him breathe, for God's sake.
2006538 2007872 What started out as a joke
2007940 2010141 has turned out to be a disaster.
2010209 2011976 Creed appears to be<br />in very serious condition.
2012044 2013912 Is the man alive?
2013979 2014913 You can make it, Apollo.
2014980 2017382 If he dies, he dies.
2036601 2041055 There's a lot I could say<br />about this man,
2041106 2045627 but I don't know if it<br />matters now.
2045694 2052149 I guess what matters<br />is what he stood for,
2052217 2055152 what he lived for,
2055220 2057922 and what he died for.
2060192 2066664 You always did everything<br />the way you wanted it.
2069067 2073170 I didn't understand that, but...
2078076 2081078 Now I understand.
2086084 2089186 I'll never forget you, Apollo.
2106605 2109107 You're the best.
2119851 2122403 Rocky, is the decision final?
2122471 2123688 Yes.
2123755 2124939 Rocky, over here, please.
2125007 2127158 Is this the first time a Champion<br />has given up his crown?
2127226 2128693 I don't know about that.
2128760 2131145 Doesn't the title mean<br />anything to you anymore?
2131212 2133814 Not until this is over.
2133882 2135916 Considering Rocky's<br />known punching power,
2135984 2138085 do you still think this<br />is going to be an easy fight?
2138153 2141088 Yes. It's a matter of science.
2141156 2144358 Evolution, isn't it, Gentlemen?
2144425 2148663 Drago is the most perfectly<br />trained athlete ever.
2148730 2151799 This other man has not<br />the size or endurance
2151867 2153834 or the genetics to win.
2153902 2157705 It's physically impossible<br />for this little man to win.
2157773 2161008 Drago is a look at the future.
2161076 2162643 Champ, there's been no<br />mention of it yet,
2162711 2164378 but how much are you making<br />for this fight?
2164445 2167447 No money.<br />It's not about money.
2167515 2169684 Has the fight date been set yet?
2169751 2170951 December 25th.
2171019 2171952 Why Christmas?
2172020 2172953 That's what I was told.
2173021 2173988 Where?
2174056 2176023 It's in Russia.
2176091 2177291 Are you nuts?
2177358 2179860 Why did you agree to this?
2179928 2181762 We fight in Soviet Union,
2181830 2183430 or we fight nowhere.
2183498 2186684 Why don't you ask Drago's<br />wife why she's afraid?
2186752 2187752 Tell them, please.
2187820 2188920 I'm afraid for my husband's life.
2188988 2191756 We have threats of violence everywhere.
2191824 2194092 Oh!<br />Oh!
2194159 2196094 We are not in politics.
2196161 2199430 All I want is for my husband to<br />be safe, to be treated fairly.
2199498 2201565 You call him a killer.
2201634 2204636 He's a professional fighter,<br />not a killer.
2204703 2207105 You have this belief that you<br />are better than us.
2207172 2210608 You have this belief that<br />this country is so very good
2210676 2212476 and we are so very bad.
2212544 2214846 You have this belief<br />that you are so fair
2214913 2216981 and we are so very cruel.
2217049 2218983 It's all lies and false propaganda
2219051 2223121 to support this antagonistic<br />and violent government.
2223188 2226290 Violent? We don't keep<br />people behind a wall
2226358 2228459 with machine guns.
2228527 2229861 Who are you?
2229928 2230895 Who am I?
2230963 2233898 I'm the unsilent majority,<br />Big Mouth!
2233966 2235499 Yay!
2235567 2237601 Yes, good.<br />Insult us.
2237670 2240905 It's more typical rude behavior<br />toward visiting foreigners.
2240973 2243107 Well, perhaps the simple defeat
2243175 2245509 of this little so called Champion
2245577 2247945 will be a perfect example
2248013 2251115 of how pathetically weak<br />your society has become.
2251183 2252850 We go!
2252918 2255119 Hey, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky!
2255187 2256287 Rocky!
2256354 2260324 Rocky, can you tell us about it?
2260392 2262126 Mrs. Balboa!
2262194 2264662 Mrs. Balboa!
2264730 2268265 How do you feel about going<br />to Russia?
2268333 2270902 How does it feel to be..
2270969 2272704 Mrs. Balboa!
2272771 2274371 Adrian, Adrian!
2274439 2276007 Mrs. Balboa, did Creed's death<br />make up your husband's mind?
2276075 2277474 I don't know what you're<br />talking about.
2277542 2280978 Why is he going at Christmas?
2281046 2283280 When are you going?
2283348 2285083 I'm not going to Russia.
2285150 2286751 I don't know what you're<br />talking about.
2286819 2288652 I don't know why you're here.
2288721 2292156 I don't know what<br />you people are doing here.
2292224 2293657 Mrs. Balboa!
2293726 2295292 Mrs. Balboa!
2317732 2319166 Rocky.
2319234 2320801 Yeah?
2324239 2326173 You all right?
2326241 2327374 Yeah.
2327442 2329676 I'm all right.
2329744 2331545 Why did you do it?
2331612 2335549 I just got to do what I got<br />to do.
2335616 2338285 You don't have to do anything.
2341622 2344191 No, Adrian, I do.
2344259 2347661 I got to leave this place, too.
2347729 2349730 So where are you going?
2349797 2352766 They said they're going to<br />let me train in Russia.
2352834 2355102 I just want to go someplace
2355170 2359106 where I ain't going to think<br />about nothing except him.
2359174 2362109 Rocky, give it some time.
2362177 2363344 Don't do this.
2363411 2364678 A lot of people live with hurt.
2364746 2367047 Adrian, a lot of people<br />don't have a choice.
2367115 2368648 I do.
2368716 2371418 And for that,<br />you're willing to lose everything?
2371486 2373387 Adrian, this ain't everything.
2373454 2377157 This house, the cars,
2377225 2378558 and all the stuff we got,
2378626 2380794 it ain't everything.
2383131 2385565 There's a lot more than this.
2385633 2389069 Before, there were reasons<br />to fight I could understand.
2389137 2391071 But I don't understand this.
2391139 2394574 Even if you win, what have you won?<br />Apollo's still gone.
2394642 2397744 Why can't you change your thinking?<br />Everybody else does.
2397812 2399746 Because I'm a fighter.
2399814 2401681 That's the way I'm made.
2401749 2403550 That's what you married.
2403618 2405619 We can't change what we are.
2405686 2408088 Yes, you can.
2408156 2410090 You can't change anything.
2410158 2414228 All we can do is go<br />with what we are.
2414296 2416263 You can't go with what you are.<br />Have you read the papers?
2416331 2419099 Do you know what everybody says?<br />It's suicide.
2419167 2422236 You've seen him.<br />You know how strong he is.
2422304 2424171 You can't win!
2428176 2430277 Oh, Adrian.
2433348 2436783 Adrian always tells the truth.
2436851 2439619 No, maybe I can't win.
2439687 2443190 Maybe the only thing I can do
2443258 2446593 is just take everything he's got.
2446661 2449096 But to beat me,
2449164 2451531 he's going to have to kill me.
2451599 2454501 And to kill me,
2454569 2457004 he's gonna have to have the heart
2457072 2459506 to stand in front of me.
2459574 2461508 And to do that,
2461576 2465512 he's got to be willing to die himself.
2465580 2469216 I don't know if he's ready to<br />do that.
2469284 2471385 I don't know.

2754485 2757021 Did you pack your toothbrush?
2757088 2758889 You know how tobacco<br />stains your teeth.
2758957 2760190 If I've told you once,
2760258 2762125 I've told you a thousand times.
2762193 2764662 Hey, stop busting my chops.
2764729 2765863 Paulie.
2765931 2768599 I'm going to have her wires<br />tied when I get back.
2769935 2772552 When will you be back?
2772620 2774554 Oh, pretty soon.
2774622 2776556 Are you scared?
2776624 2778558 No.
2778626 2781795 Yes, you are.<br />A little, maybe?
2781863 2783297 Well, wouldn't you be?
2783365 2786600 If a big, giant man<br />wanted to beat me up,
2786667 2788602 I'd be real scared.
2791206 2794641 Well, the truth is, you know, sometimes
2794709 2798712 I do get a little scared, you know.
2798779 2800514 When I'm in that ring
2800581 2802116 and I'm really getting hit on,
2802183 2806153 and my arms hurt so much<br />I can't even lift them,
2806221 2810957 and I'm thinking, God, I wish<br />this guy would hit me on the chin
2811026 2813360 so I don't feel nothing anymore.
2813428 2817031 Then there's another<br />side that comes out
2817098 2819199 that isn't so scared.
2819267 2824638 It's another side<br />that wants to take more,
2824705 2828742 that wants to go that one<br />more round
2828809 2831078 because going one more round
2831146 2834081 when you don't think you can,
2834149 2838085 that's what makes all the<br />difference in your life.
2838153 2839586 You know what I mean?
2839654 2842689 Will you remember one more thing?
2842757 2844758 Will you remember that daddy thinks
2844825 2847994 you're the best boy in the world,
2848063 2852766 and that daddy loves you<br />no matter what.
2861176 2863877 I got to go now.
2863945 2866613 Will you take care of everything?
2866681 2867747 Okay.
2867815 2871552 Don't forget to feed your<br />robot, okay?

3208555 3210656 Yeah, sure.
3211558 3213492 How you doing?
3213560 3214994 Pretty good.
3215062 3217496 Some kind of weather<br />we're having up here, huh?
3217564 3219332 It's pretty rough.

3853199 3854800 Hello, Everybody, and Merry Christmas
3854868 3856469 from an unusual place.
3856536 3858604 We're in Moscow,<br />in the Soviet Union.
3858672 3861006 I'm Barry Tompkins,<br />along with Al Bandiero,
3861074 3864343 and this promises to be the most<br />watched event in boxing history.
3864411 3867380 The Iron Horse from America,<br />Rocky Balboa...
3867447 3869948 (Russian)
3871017 3872852 Ivan Drago.
3872919 3874387 Since that tragedy in Las Vegas
3874454 3875554 and the death of Apollo Creed.
3875622 3879558 He's been renicknamed<br />"Death From Above."
3891638 3892571 Drago!
3892639 3896174 Drago!<br />Drago!
3900547 3901680 Drago!
3910990 3914259 High above us, the General<br />Secretary of the Soviet
3914327 3917496 and other members of the Politburo<br />have now made their way to their seats
3917564 3920332 high above the ring here in Moscow.
3924003 3928040 Rock, I know you're<br />kind of busy just now,
3928107 3930443 but I want to tell you some<br />things I never told you.
3930510 3935448 I know sometimes I act stupid,<br />and I say stupid things,
3935515 3937450 but you kept me around when<br />other people would have said,
3937517 3939518 "Drop that bum."<br />You give me respect.
3939586 3943489 You know, it's hard for me to say these things.<br />That ain't my way.
3943557 3946492 But if I could just unzip myself<br />and step out and be someone else,
3946560 3949094 I'd want to be you.
3949162 3952064 You're all heart, Rock.
3953767 3955468 Thanks, Paulie.
3955535 3958838 Now bust this guy's teeth out.
3958905 3960873 I'll try.
3969248 3971049 Boo!<br />Boo!
3971117 3973652 Boo!<br />Boo!
3977557 3979525 Right now, one of the fighters,<br />starting to make his way
3979593 3982227 through this crowd<br />and toward the ring.
3982295 3984029 Listen to this crowd.
3984097 3985698 We knew he wouldn't be popular,
3985765 3987533 but this borders on pure hatred.
3987601 3989334 Rocky's face absolutely like stone..
3989402 3991670 He is a picture of concentration,
3991738 3994974 and the booing crowd here does<br />not seem to bother him a bit.
3995041 3997810 The Champ has a look tonight<br />could burn through lead.
3997878 4000579 It seems that the booing crowd has<br />absolutely no effect on the man.
4000647 4003916 His concentration seems to be<br />like stone.
4003984 4005417 That's my dad.
4005485 4007052 We know.
4007120 4008921 What do you think we are, Nerds?
4008989 4012791 Listen to this crowd.<br />It sounds insane.
4012859 4016094 Boo!<br />Boo!
4019566 4024436 And now, the entrance of the Russian<br />National Champion, Ivan Drago,
4024504 4029107 a man with an entire country<br />in his corner.
4080193 4083361 Look at the expression on the<br />face of Ivan Drago.
4083429 4086899 He seems impervious to<br />this madness of the crowd.
4086967 4089735 He's like a volcano<br />just waiting to erupt.
4089803 4092337 The Russian champion is<br />amazingly cool,
4092405 4094907 Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />as he acknowledges his premier.
4094975 4097409 As I say,<br />I would like point out again,
4097477 4100345 this is a nonsanctioned fight.
4100413 4102815 This is not for the title.
4102882 4106451 The American Boxing Commission<br />has not sanctioned this bout.
4111858 4113892 (Russian)
4123402 4127106 (Russian)
4201181 4203682 Ladies and Gentlemen...
4203750 4205317 (Russian)
4211591 4213425 Rocky Balboa!
4213492 4215828 Boo!<br />Boo!
4217964 4219364 It's unbelievable.
4219432 4223168 I have never in all my years<br />seen such a hostile crowd.
4228942 4231643 (Russian)
4231711 4233746 Ivan Drago!
4242806 4244773 They're screaming and roaring<br />for their champion.
4244841 4248944 The two men are walking toward<br />the center of the ring.
4249012 4250779 It's an unbelievable sight to see.
4250847 4252948 They're toe to toe.
4253016 4256451 The Russian towers above the American.
4256519 4259955 It's a true case of David and<br />Goliath here.
4260023 4264392 It's unbelievable<br />the condition of both men.
4264460 4267562 I must break you.
4268664 4271834 Ivan!<br />Ivan Drago!
4271901 4275871 Remember what I said back<br />there about wanting to be you?
4275939 4276905 Yeah.
4276973 4279074 Forget it.
4279976 4282111 Thanks, Paul.
4282178 4285280 (Russian)
4288852 4291787 Take it straight to him.<br />Take it straight to him,
4291855 4294356 and be a rock for me. Understand?
4294423 4295991 Be a rock for me!<br />Be strong!
4296059 4298360 All right, now take it to him,<br />no pain!
4298427 4300195 No pain!<br />No pain!
4300263 4302030 No pain!<br />Do it!
4304951 4306451 There's the bell for the<br />opening round,
4306520 4308787 and Rocky Balboa comes out<br />to the center of the ring,
4308855 4310789 but the Russian going back<br />into Balboa's corner now.
4310857 4312024 Grab him!
4312091 4313826 Grab him!
4315061 4317229 Get out of there!
4317296 4318363 Spin him out!<br />Let's go, Rock!
4318431 4319932 Get out of there!
4323236 4325037 Balboa gets out of the corner now
4325104 4328306 and moves forward, as Drago,<br />backing Rocky Balboa up with a jab.
4328374 4330643 And Balboa is not staying on balance
4330710 4333979 because of the long jab<br />of the Russian.
4334047 4336448 Brace yourself!<br />Brace yourself!
4341021 4342521 Hands up!
4344490 4346058 Charge him!<br />Now!
4346125 4349161 He can't seem to touch the Russian.
4349228 4352431 Rocky pounding away at<br />the midsection of the Russian,
4352498 4355167 and he's just hit him<br />with everything he's got.
4355234 4357335 And Drago just smiled at him.
4357403 4359171 Keep chopping away!
4359238 4360873 Chop him down!
4368247 4371951 Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble.
4372018 4375387 They might have to stop this one<br />before somebody gets killed.
4375455 4377556 Reach and grab him!
4379559 4381894 Rocky's hurt.<br />He woke the sleeping giant,
4381962 4384396 and now he's paying the price.
4384464 4388701 A right hand from Drago sends Rocky<br />Balboa 15 feet across the ring.
4388768 4390903 The Champ is down.
4390971 4393005 (Russian)
4393073 4395908 Rock! Get up!
4395976 4398176 Come on, get up!
4399713 4401780 Hands up!
4401848 4403849 Hands up!
4409489 4412992 Drago continuing to punish<br />Rocky Balboa.
4413059 4414960 He just will not let him<br />out of that corner.
4415028 4416895 Rocky Balboa is just trying
4416963 4420565 to get through this first round.
4423369 4426939 The Russian threw Rocky Balboa<br />into his own corner
4427007 4429008 like a rag doll.
4429075 4432511 A tough first 3 minutes<br />for Rocky Balboa.
4432578 4435014 He's not only fighting what appears<br />to be an invincible opponent.
4435081 4437016 He's also fighting<br />a very hostile crowd
4437083 4440986 and the Russian premier and most<br />of the Politburo looking on.
4441154 4443655 All right,<br />what's happening out there?
4443723 4445424 He's winning.
4445492 4448327 I see three of him out there.
4448394 4449661 Hit the one in the middle.
4449729 4451796 Right. Hit the one in the middle.
4451864 4453031 Yeah, okay.
4460373 4461673 Take his heart.
4461741 4463808 You hurt him, you'll take his heart.<br />No pain.
4463876 4465511 Take his heart.
4466712 4468614 Here's the bell for round 2.
4468681 4470715 It's been a one sided<br />fight so far.
4470783 4472050 It'll take more than luck
4472118 4473352 for Rocky to survive this round.
4473419 4474886 Rocky's been hit with bombs.
4474954 4477489 Step and hook, Rock.<br />Step and hook.
4477557 4480892 Balboa trying to stay in the middle<br />of the ring against the big Russian.
4480960 4483228 Move the head!
4483296 4487932 Do what you got to do!<br />Stay with him!
4496276 4499511 Rocky's fighting back ferociously.
4503416 4504583 Rocky!
4506919 4510789 And Balboa goes down again<br />from a right hand,
4510856 4512791 bounces right back up.
4512858 4515494 He's getting killed out there.
4516629 4518530 (Russian)
4518598 4522401 Rocky Balboa has taken Ivan<br />Drago's best punches so far.
4522468 4526104 He's cut and he's bleeding, but he's<br />on his feet and he's on the run.
4528541 4530909 Hold on!<br />Hold on!
4532712 4534446 He's cut!<br />He's cut!
4534514 4537148 The Russian's cut..<br />It's a bad cut!
4537217 4541353 Now it's Rocky Balboa<br />coming after Ivan Drago.
4551264 4552997 Get him!
4554166 4555133 Yeah!
4557870 4559904 The Russian wants to goes on.
4559972 4561373 He grabs Rocky Balboa by the throat.
4561441 4563642 Balboa picking up the Russian
4563710 4566411 and throws him to the ground<br />just like a wrestler.
4566479 4569948 It's a gutter war..<br />No holds barred in Moscow.
4570015 4572718 Rocky may be on the receiving<br />end so far,
4572785 4574986 but he's here to fight.
4575054 4576288 This is shaping up to be a<br />personal war,
4576356 4579558 and right now,<br />it's anybody's boxing match.
4579626 4583395 You're doing good, Rocko.<br />I couldn't do better myself.
4583463 4585063 Thanks.
4588651 4590051 You've got him hurt bad. Yeah?
4590119 4591220 Now, he's worried.
4591287 4593422 You cut him!<br />You hurt him!
4593489 4597226 You see, you see? He's not a machine!<br />He's a man!
4604734 4606935 You want it more than he does.<br />No pain.
4607002 4608470 No pain.
4608538 4610138 No pain.<br />No pain.
4610206 4613692 Okay, take it to him, take<br />it to him, take it to him.
4624269 4625570 Come on!
4631511 4633111 Get up!
4667446 4669581 It's all right.
4674186 4677022 A good right hand by Rocky Balboa.
4703950 4707318 You're doing fine.<br />You're doing great.
4713693 4714993 Hook him!
4735180 4738984 Keep moving!<br />Go!
4771583 4772917 Come on!
4772985 4774185 Da!
4780359 4783995 A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa.
4784063 4786865 Suddenly Moscow is Pro-Rocky.
4798077 4800478 No pain.<br />No pain.
4802447 4804582 Keep punching.
4806852 4808286 Rock, no pain.
4825470 4828807 This place is ready to explode.
4828874 4831209 Punch after punch..<br />Amazing what power.
4831276 4832243 Neither man backing off,
4832311 4834145 Rocky Balboa's determination
4834213 4837415 is actually beginning to win over<br />what was once a hostile crowd.
4837482 4839383 This is incredible.
4839451 4841436 What round is it?
4841503 4843138 15. One more round.
4843205 4846241 There's no stopping us now.<br />This is our round.
4846309 4847943 Rocky!<br />Rocky!
4848010 4849945 Rocky!<br />Rocky!
4850012 4851446 Rocky!<br />Rocky!

4875988 4877055 Nyet!
4888034 4889434 To win, you got to knock him out.
4889501 4891202 You got to punch and punch
4891270 4892804 until you can't punch no more.
4892871 4894739 This is your whole life here.
4894807 4897409 Knock him out, Rocko.
4897476 4899344 Do it now, now!
4899412 4901446 The war is on.
4901513 4904349 This is the last round.
4907886 4910521 To the end.
4910589 4914326 Which one of these magnificent<br />fighters will be standing
4914393 4915626 at the end of this round?
4915694 4919530 Drago snaps out a stiff jab,<br />and another.
4922001 4925337 Another. Rocky taking punishment,<br />trying to get inside.
4925404 4928039 He's completely exhausted.
4928107 4930308 Come on, Rock.
4930376 4932210 What are you waiting for?
4939185 4940118 Hit him!

4972985 4976488 And Drago delivers<br />a hard right hand
4976555 4978756 that stuns Rocky Balboa.
4982061 4984062 Don't go down!
4984130 4985696 Don't go down!
4989468 4992337 Forget technique.<br />Forget strategy.
4992405 4993905 This is just a street fight.
4993972 4995573 It's a question<br />of who wants it most.
4995641 4996574 What is he doing?

5063209 5065276 Rocky!<br />Rocky!
5093071 5095006 Thank you.
5095073 5097675 (Russian)
5099612 5102313 I came here tonight,
5102381 5104983 and I didn't know what to expect.
5105050 5106851 (Russian)
5106918 5111055 I seen a lot of people hating me,
5111123 5115360 and I didn't know<br />what to feel about that,
5115427 5120031 so I guess I didn't<br />like you much none, either.
5120099 5123267 (Russian)
5124936 5130008 During this fight,<br />I seen a lot of changing.
5130075 5133878 (Russian)
5133945 5137348 The way you felt about me
5137416 5141019 and the way I felt about you.
5141086 5144088 (Russian)
5144156 5151162 In here, there were two guys<br />killing each other,
5151230 5155666 but I guess that's better<br />than 20 million.
5155734 5159103 (Russian)
5159171 5161772 What I'm trying to say
5161840 5165943 is that if I can change...
5166011 5167478 (Russian)
5167546 5169447 And you can change...
5169515 5172483 (Russian)
5172551 5174618 Everybody can change!
5174686 5176887 (Russian)
5193004 5197075 I just want to say<br />one thing to my kid,
5197142 5198476 who should be home sleeping,
5198544 5200545 Merry Christmas, Kid.
5201547 5203647 I love you!
