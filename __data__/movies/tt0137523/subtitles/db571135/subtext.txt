1919 5913 (man) This is commentary by<br />director of photography Jeff Cronenweth,
6006 8464 costume designer Michael Kaplan,
8550 10712 production designer Alex McDowell,
10802 13169 visual-effects supervisor Kevin Haug,
13263 16005 and digital animator Doc Baily.
29947 31028 Doc Baily.
31281 35115 (Doc) At the beginning of this project,<br />when it was in preproduction,
35202 39571 there were four main effects sequences.
39665 43909 There was the corporate sculpture<br />explosion-demolition.
44002 47870 There was the main title sequence.
47965 51128 There was Jack's apartment fire
51218 56304 where the stove and the refrigerator and...<br />his apartment goes up.
56640 61510 Then there was the closing scene, which<br />was the demolition of a fictitious city
61603 64061 that just happened to look<br />a lot like Century City.
64147 67765 It was supposed to be<br />somewhere like Wilmington, Delaware.
68235 72980 Oh, and then there was another sequence -<br />the airplane explosion. That was a big one.
73282 76195 So there were four or five sequences.<br />Maybe another one.
76326 77782 I bid on all of those.
77995 82364 And then, as time went on, the complexity<br />of the project started to increase
82457 85245 and it actually started to get blocked out
85335 88703 and I figured out how much time<br />and resources I was gonna have.
88839 92878 Rather than build up<br />a big factory out of my studio,
92968 98088 I decided to just stay the same size<br />as I was and just take on the one shot,
98181 100673 which was the demolition at the end.
102352 103717 (man) Jeff Cronenweth.
103979 107472 (Jeff) I watched the whole<br />process of the title sequence
107566 108772 come together from head to toe.
108859 113649 And so, as each layer built upon itself,<br />it just got more and more magical.
113864 117983 However, I do have a problem<br />with how fast my name goes by.
118243 119904 (laughter)
120454 123196 (Doc) I was gonna say the same thing, Jeff.
123332 124822 (Jeff) It's the only problem I see here.
129004 129994 From the lighting standpoint,
130088 133706 this beginning and ending sequence<br />was a challenge
133800 137634 because it was a vacant high-rise<br />that didn't have any fixtures built into it.
137721 143387 So, in order to keep the premise of the<br />all-natural, realistic photography in this,
143477 147471 we needed some practical sources that<br />could motivate any kind of light sources
147564 149555 in the whole floor of this building.
149691 154356 We used these outdoor<br />Home Depot work lights
154446 157279 and spread them out strategically<br />in this building
157366 161906 and used them to motivate our sources<br />and then cheated around it.
163914 165120 (man) Kevin Haug.
165248 169162 (Kevin) The modeling and rendering<br />technique for the image space,
169419 174255 it put Michael Middleton, the visual-effects<br />photographer, to work for quite a while.
174508 177751 It was funny. We hired Michael<br />to shoot a few pictures for us.
178053 181762 But BUF don't shoot their own stills.<br />They usually want the DP to do it.
181932 184594 When I talked to Jeff early on<br />he said he'd love to do it.
184685 189020 But a month into the movie, he had no<br />chance to walk around with a still camera
189106 192349 while he was doing<br />what he was hired to be there doing.
192609 194850 So we brought in Michael.
194945 197403 Michael was with Apogee.<br />He's been around a long time.
197489 199947 We put him in dangerous, crazy positions.
200033 202946 In Century City at night<br />we had to cross those streets.
203078 206287 And it was the middle of the night,<br />but still, we had one cop,
206373 210207 and Pierre Buffin was next to Michael<br />in the middle of the street...
210293 214878 People are stupid. They drive down the<br />street and people are standing in the way.
214965 218503 But they keep barreling along<br />as if you're gonna move out of the way.
218593 222587 And the cop is moving them<br />out of the way. It got fairly crazy.
222681 227266 We had him up on tops of buildings and all<br />sorts of other things to get all these stills.
227644 230557 I think we shot miles of film.
230689 234478 Carrie and Leslie ended up with<br />a small room filled with still photos.
234901 237893 We'd do three and a half by five stills<br />and lay them out
237988 239854 so BUF could pick which ones they needed
239948 243486 and David could pick which ones he liked,<br />if there was something to choose.
243827 248446 It was pretty funny. It was not your usual<br />visual effects kind of tracking job.
248540 250827 We had to make up a way<br />of working things.
251001 253083 BUF wasn't a lot of help.
253170 255457 We thought they'd have<br />all these techniques figured out.
255547 257584 When we started the sex sequence,
257674 259381 the woman looked at<br />how we were doing it
259468 261379 and said, "Let's do it like this."
261470 264212 I was like, "Fuck.<br />We thought this was a starting point.
264306 266047 "We thought you could help."
266141 268132 So, anyway.
329287 332405 There are five subliminal Brads<br />in the movie.
332582 336997 Most people can find three of them,<br />there's a fourth that's kind of difficult
337087 338873 and a fifth I'd defy anyone to find
338964 341672 unless they worked on the movie<br />and can find the spot.
341758 347754 He's actually in the video that's playback<br />on the screen, so it's extra-hidden.
349015 352178 But the theory here was that Brad was
352269 357184 coming out of Ed's consciousness<br />at that point.
357399 360187 Also, there's this single-frame thing<br />going on in the movie.
360277 364441 The crossovers and cigarette burns<br />and all these things are all of a piece.
364781 369571 So the idea of sticking Brad in a couple of<br />places where he didn't really belong was...
369786 371618 Almost from the beginning of prep,
371705 374948 I think it was an idea<br />David had talked over with Brad earlier,
375041 377954 and he came in one day and said,<br />"I wanna do this."
378169 381628 Brad would show up on a day<br />when he wasn't on the call sheet.
382924 385507 David would have him<br />stand out there and goof around
385594 388837 and we'd find the frame we liked<br />and drop him in.
388972 391430 The trickiest part was<br />some shots were long
391516 394679 and they had to match all the shots<br />around them.
395103 397310 Technical bullshit, basically.
397397 400981 But we found tricky places to slip him in -<br />one during a rack focus.
401067 405186 So he's sharp-focus on the frame<br />where that background is at sharp focus
405280 406520 and everything's out.
406615 411951 A lot of people complained that you<br />couldn't see it, so why were we doing it?
412037 414574 Basically we were doing it<br />for the DVD crowd.
414664 417656 Someone would, frame by frame,<br />find Brad.
417751 419662 Up until you can frame-by-frame,
419753 422711 it's the most expensive piece of dirt<br />you'll see on a frame.
422797 426335 It just disappears<br />and you assume it's neg dirt.
427218 432338 The Brads are... The first one's<br />when he's looking back over the copier.
432515 434506 One when he comes out of the church
434601 437389 and walks around<br />and looks up the alley at Marla.
437938 440600 One is when they're in<br />Remaining Men Together
440690 443022 and his arm is around<br />the shoulder of the guy.
443109 446352 And another's in the hospital corridor.
446529 452946 And one is in a piece of playback when Ed<br />is in the hotel room early on in the movie
453036 457621 and he's looking forward and everybody's<br />saying, "Welcome!" and Brad's there.
457707 461951 He's not so subliminal. He's a bit longer,<br />but he's so hidden that we figured...
462212 465000 We were going to pop him<br />in and out of that one too.
465090 468378 When David looked at it, it was like,<br />"Forget it. This is fine."
469219 470380 (man) Michael Kaplan.
470470 474805 (Michael) Talking about Bob, he'd lost a lot<br />of weight, and we needed him to be obese.
474891 479556 So we created this whole fat suit<br />out of foam,
479646 483059 and his breasts were actually<br />made out of silks,
483149 485641 or nylon stockings, filled with birdseed
485735 491276 so that they'd be pendulous<br />when he was moving and running around.
491366 496202 The nipples were initially not put on<br />and it looked very strange,
496287 501578 and so we sewed little buttons on,<br />and they did the trick.
501710 504327 (Jeff) On camera<br />it looked fantastically realistic,
504629 507542 although it did put a weight on Meat Loaf
507632 512172 and he would be restricted<br />to the amount of times he could wear it.
512345 514211 It created a lot of heat.
514305 520517 (Michael) Extremely heavy, and it was hard<br />for him to stand in for long periods of time.
520979 525143 (Jeff) I think that some of this was achieved<br />when we printed it. We printed it down.
525442 529481 There was quite a bit of latitude<br />the way that we exposed the negative,
529571 531278 so we had a few choices.
531364 537781 But I thought I would get more heat for<br />the fact that you don't see a lot of eyes.
538204 541322 It's a bunch of raccoons,<br />at least in the beginning of the picture,
541416 547458 which was all part of the motif of using<br />practical sources and realistic locations.
547964 552754 These situations normally have<br />top-light sources, and so we went with it
553136 557801 and added elements of green tones<br />to these sequences
557891 562135 to give it this look of reality.
562729 566893 I mean, at least<br />Edward's reality in this movie.
568068 571231 We created lighting sequences<br />and lit people dramatically
571321 576657 and created a lot of contrast,<br />which Michael helped with.
576993 581112 The tonality of the clothes<br />was rather down.
581206 582913 There was nothing<br />that popped off the screen.
582999 586367 We treated all the whites<br />so that we wouldn't have problems
586461 591171 with white, white T-shirts or white, white<br />sheets or white, white drapes or anything.
591382 596877 And I made a fairly rich exposure,<br />in spite of where we put the lights,
596971 603217 and then we created a very nice high light<br />on our printing lights,
603853 606561 which gave us the latitude to then go back
606648 608810 and create contrast -<br />or not create contrast,
608900 613610 but create the richness of this picture<br />by stepping on it.
614739 617276 (Michael) All the white<br />shirts that Edward wears
617367 621861 early on are a pale, pale grayish-beige.
623373 627617 People in Wardrobe know that's called<br />a tech-white. And there's various stages.
627710 630998 I would say this is about a two tech.
631464 636254 Usually there's one, two and three levels<br />of overdyeing that you can do,
636344 638381 just so that the whites don't pop.
643893 645179 (man) Alex McDowell.
645395 646806 (Alex) We wanted the ice cave to have
646896 650230 that luminescent glow<br />that you get from a glacier
650400 654314 and tried to make it<br />as realistic as possible.
654404 657487 We went to great lengths<br />with testing of paint
657574 660282 'cause we, at one point,<br />wanted to cut the foam
660368 662575 so thin that you could actually backlight it.
662954 665161 But it just wasn't practical.
665248 667910 We'd have had to build a structure<br />to hold it up to do that.
668001 671494 So we ended up doing tests<br />of transparency and paint
671588 677334 and building layers of paint up and up until<br />it actually sold the depth and the light
677427 681466 and then did this scalloping which caught<br />the backlight from both directions.
681556 685015 We were trying to make it<br />as ephemeral as possible.
685101 689060 But here's an example<br />of building something
689147 691684 really with no possibility<br />of doing drawings,
691774 694607 building everything<br />from a scale model to enormous detail.
695778 701615 The sculptors built it inch by inch<br />to match the small model.
701993 704530 (Jeff) It was interesting<br />to light that set as well.
704704 709915 David and Alex had some references,<br />like he said, of Arctic ice
710001 714290 all backlit in a subtle glow<br />with a greenish-blue tonality to it
714631 719341 and with the idea that his breath<br />was always gonna be CGI later,
719552 724718 creating a look that was surreal enough<br />but stayed in the context of our movie,
725141 726552 and the feeling of the ice
726643 731809 and having some atmosphere<br />so that the breath played off better.
732148 734230 It wasn't as easy<br />as I thought it was gonna be.
734317 736684 But I'm really happy<br />with the way it came out.
737153 739440 (Alex) We built false perspective into that.
739530 744775 It just looked like those backlit ends<br />were infinitely far away.
745245 748783 (Michael) There's a bunch of little<br />subliminal penguins in the movie.
748873 754164 Edward has a tie and boxer shorts<br />and a couple of other things.
754504 758122 We put it subtly into his wardrobe
758216 761709 as maybe some kind of<br />psychological reasoning
761803 765512 for the penguin to be his power animal.
801050 803963 Generally, I wanted it, as did David...
804053 807671 we wanted the support groups<br />to look real, you know,
807765 810803 create real characters<br />from all walks of life.
810893 813134 So, basically, that's what we did.
813229 818224 I think the only thing that might have been<br />specific about our recipe
818318 823688 is that the colors we used were<br />a little bit more somber than reality.
846554 849467 Marla arrived from London<br />a couple of weeks
849557 851639 before she was supposed to start shooting.
851726 856562 She didn't quite know<br />which way to go or who her character was
856647 861642 and she asked for my help, she asked if<br />there was any way I could describe Marla,
861736 868199 and I said, "Well, I think I see Marla<br />as Judy Garland, close to the end."
868284 873324 "That kind of frailness, that vulnerability,<br />that... She had a birdlike quality."
873748 879664 And everybody seemed to love<br />that kind of idea and latched onto it.
879754 884339 In fact, during shooting<br />Fincher would call her Judy.
884634 889970 Helena would be sitting in her mobile<br />home, waiting to be called onto the set
890056 895768 and she'd be listening to<br />old Judy Garland records, getting into it.
911285 914778 I love that moment when Helena's<br />filling up her cup with coffee
914872 917910 and one of the other<br />support group members
918000 919616 is clearly making a beeline for her,
919710 923203 and then Edward comes over<br />and he kind of just turns on his heel.
923756 927249 (Jeff) I didn't realize the coffee<br />was still pouring into the cup.
927343 931462 Take after take, I never saw it until<br />we were timing the picture. It's hysterical.
931556 934844 (Michael) It's great.<br />I've seen this movie a few times
934934 937551 and still see things that I haven't seen.
938020 944392 (Jeff) Yeah. Even in dailies, I never<br />noticed it until we were timing the picture.
944652 946234 At that point you can see a lot.
946320 950188 You can't hear anything,<br />so all you do is stare at the visuals.
950700 956537 David and I chose to shoot this picture<br />on spherical glass,
956622 958613 as opposed to anamorphic,
958708 964294 primarily for lens choices<br />and speed of those lenses.
964380 966872 We found ourselves shooting<br />in a lot of practical locations
966966 970630 and inherently wanting to use<br />whatever was there
970720 972802 as a basis for our lighting sources,
972889 974471 and then adding onto that.
974849 978467 Shooting anamorphic<br />wouldn't have allowed us
978561 980802 to shoot under those low-light conditions.
980897 983605 So we chose spherical lenses
983691 989562 and went on to do
989655 991646 a 70mm extraction of that negative
991741 995575 to get your blow-ups<br />for your large theatrical releases.
995745 999784 It certainly shows, in depth at least,<br />on some of our night exteriors
999874 1002081 when you see background<br />city lights pop out
1002168 1006708 that we couldn't have had happen<br />with the slower anamorphic glass.
1006797 1009505 So I think it was a great choice.
1009592 1011583 David's so familiar with that.
1011844 1016805 It's just comfortable for both of us<br />and it certainly worked for this picture.
1017183 1023930 You end up with your larger negative size<br />than traditional 35mm film.
1024190 1027854 With Super 35, it gives you<br />a little more material for your extraction,
1027944 1031687 but they make a dupe and then blow it up.
1031822 1037613 Unfortunately you pick up grain and<br />contrast in doing so, which I would have...
1037703 1041697 That's the bonus of using an anamorphic,<br />'cause you skip a process
1041791 1044954 and you have<br />a much cleaner image at the end.
1045294 1050209 But then you have a tougher time<br />getting those images to begin with.
1050466 1055802 So... following through this picture,
1055888 1058721 this being my first picture<br />all the way through as a DP,
1058808 1061425 I was a bit shocked<br />at the amount of contrast
1061519 1064102 and grain that we picked up<br />in the extraction.
1064188 1069729 It was a bit disappointing, but fortunately<br />it fits perfectly for this movie.
1071821 1075530 (Michael) It's rare that you see Helena's<br />feet - or any feet - in this movie.
1075616 1081237 But Helena, throughout the entire movie,<br />wore extremely high platform shoes,
1081330 1083571 'cause it was right for the character,
1083666 1090584 and also, Fincher wanted her to be<br />as tall as possible, and she's quite small.
1091007 1097379 And I used old vintage shoes<br />from the '603 and '50s, big platforms,
1097471 1100634 and she teetered about,<br />and I think it added to the character.
1100725 1104184 But also, there were many times<br />when she fell off of them.
1104312 1105473 (laughs)
1106063 1111024 I'd hear her from far away<br />cursing my name.
1131881 1136876 (Jeff) I think every DP should be so lucky as<br />to have a face like Helena's to photograph.
1137053 1140921 She has such lovely skin<br />and high cheekbones,
1141015 1143598 you almost can't light her bad.
1143684 1146096 Her presence on screen<br />always comes across.
1146187 1151148 She's so beautiful that we put her in<br />some not-so-flattering lighting situations
1151233 1153224 and she always looked great.
1153653 1160241 It was inherent to her character, but we<br />weren't afraid to go there. Nor was she.
1160826 1167072 Normally, you would have a vanity<br />problem, which didn't exist with her.
1167166 1171125 In some situations,<br />she had reactions to makeup,
1171462 1176332 and, rather than cover them up,<br />she was all game to go for it,
1176425 1180760 and they're there, huge,<br />on those 40“ screens.
1186102 1190312 (Michael) Prep time is not what it seems,
1190398 1196986 because Helena, being English...<br />I don't think she was on another film.
1197071 1201110 But I spoke to her in England maybe<br />eight weeks before she started working,
1201200 1204409 but I didn't see her<br />until maybe three weeks before,
1204495 1208079 so I didn't have<br />that long of a prep with her.
1208165 1212079 And, in a way, that worked well<br />because I started preparing without her
1212169 1218006 and she kind of liked the idea<br />that there was remnants of a character -
1218092 1223087 not remnants, but a character taking form<br />without her that she could step into.
1223180 1226389 She liked that Marla was<br />somewhat developed
1226475 1229433 and she could collaborate with me
1229520 1235857 on discarding what was not in the right<br />direction for her and keep what was.
1279779 1283773 (Alex) David's very accurate<br />about his intentions,
1283949 1289069 both storyboarding, but also<br />just on a scale - on an early scale.
1289163 1295705 We would go out, just three or four<br />of us, for preliminary scouts,
1296170 1300789 and David would be very clear about the<br />angle, the lens, the height of the camera,
1301634 1303966 what he'd want to do in a location.
1304053 1307136 It makes it so much easier to do your job.
1307556 1309467 And then the storyboards, I think,
1309558 1312095 probably all the time,<br />you could follow them.
1312186 1314302 The frames would be really accurate.
1314396 1320938 (Jeff) Yeah, it's fantastic that someone<br />can commit to that so far ahead of it.
1321028 1327741 It makes it so much easier for us to design<br />lighting setups and to design sets.
1327827 1330694 You don't have to cover yourself endlessly
1330788 1335077 because you know you're not going to<br />vary very much from those storyboards.
1335543 1338501 Occasionally, if something<br />was better, we'd change.
1338587 1342421 But, more or less,<br />we stuck to the original ideas.
1342633 1345625 (Alex) We did not only<br />conventional storyboards,
1345719 1350930 but also, David used<br />a process called pre-vis,
1351016 1356682 which is kind of a three-D storyboarding,<br />animated storyboard,
1356981 1359814 where you build a model of a set,
1359900 1364815 particularly for the visual-effects shots,<br />in the computer,
1365281 1371243 and then David would spend time with<br />the computer model and place the camera,
1371495 1374829 work out the camera move,<br />decide on the lens.
1375124 1380244 And there were several times<br />where we had information
1380337 1382374 maybe four months ahead of time
1382464 1384125 that was absolutely accurate.
1384216 1389962 Where we'd make decisions on the sets,<br />in one instance, down to the half-inch
1390055 1393548 with a motion-control shot<br />that never changed.
1393642 1399388 The plane crash was planned<br />to a tiny degree,
1399481 1401939 to the most minute detail.
1441857 1443894 (Michael) After I read the script,
1443984 1450697 I knew that Tyler Durden was gonna be<br />pretty "out there" wardrobe-wise,
1450991 1455610 to go with how out there<br />he was as a character,
1455704 1459538 and I asked David,<br />who doesn't like color very much,
1459625 1463084 how far I could go with Brad's character.
1463170 1467664 And he said, "You can't go too far<br />with Tyler Durden."
1468133 1470124 And...
1471303 1475922 I was amazed that he let me do<br />a lot of the stuff that I did, compared to...
1476225 1478136 We worked together<br />on The Game and on Se7en,
1478227 1481970 and the palette's pretty restricted
1482064 1486729 in terms of a lot of color.
1486902 1491738 I was surprised
1491824 1494907 that Dave allowed
1494994 1499909 all those reds and oranges<br />and vibrant colors that Brad wears.
1501166 1503954 (Jeff) He's the only person<br />that wears anything like that.
1504044 1508003 (Michael) Yeah.<br />When you'd walk into the wardrobe trailer,
1508090 1510457 Brad's clothes were hanging
1510551 1516092 directly across from Edward's.
1517975 1521934 Tyler's side - Brad's side - was vibrant.
1523147 1527516 Edward's side was grays and beiges.<br />So boring.
1527609 1530727 You couldn't believe those two characters<br />were in the same movie.
1530821 1536316 (Jeff) That defines the two personalities<br />of the two characters perfectly.
1546545 1547706 But in the six weeks that I had to prep,
1548297 1549708 amongst other things,
1549798 1554133 I had the rare opportunity of testing every<br />light source that we used in the picture,
1554303 1558046 as well as testing<br />the clothing Michael was
1558140 1560973 dressing them in and some of the makeup,
1561143 1567139 different processes that we used<br />and some of the prosthetics that we used,
1567232 1569223 and to find out what looked realistic
1569318 1572561 and how we could actually<br />bring out the prosthetics
1572654 1578525 and make them look like real wounds<br />as opposed to prosthetics.
1578619 1583113 And then what angle of light<br />enhanced all those situations.
1583207 1586245 We tested everything<br />from the copy-machine
1586335 1589418 light sources to the headlights of cars.
1590005 1593748 And it's a rare opportunity to get
1593842 1597426 to evaluate those choices<br />that far ahead of time.
1597513 1600596 Normally you just have<br />to scramble on the set
1600682 1604016 and use experience<br />to make your decisions.
1604103 1610941 But two weeks of shooting tests,<br />film tests, lighting tests,
1611026 1614360 really helped this picture and helped me.
1620452 1623911 (Michael) Wardrobe has help<br />in that I get everyone else's input
1623997 1626455 and weed things out earlier on.
1626542 1628658 I mostly know how things will photograph
1628752 1631210 from having done<br />what I do for a long time,
1631547 1633584 and I've had fittings with the actors.
1633674 1636462 But I think it gives
1636552 1640796 the DP an idea
1640889 1643677 of the kind of things<br />that he's gonna be dealing with.
1644852 1649642 But also, I think the director can see
1649731 1652598 if I've gone too far with Tyler's character.
1652693 1655230 In fact, once I presented<br />something to David
1655320 1658278 and he said,<br />"This time, you have gone too far."
1658824 1659814 (Jeff) What was that?
1659908 1665904 (Michael) It was a complete outfit in various<br />shades of red on red on red on red.
1666081 1672077 Brad and I loved it, but I think<br />we did go over the top a little bit.
1672754 1675416 Maybe we were just testing David.
1681763 1686178 A lot of Brad's clothes look like<br />they were just picked up in a thrift shop,
1686268 1689351 and that's the look we were going for.
1689438 1693853 But unfortunately it wasn't that easy
1694735 1698194 since we need so many multiples<br />for various reasons -
1698280 1704367 stuntmen and doubles for all the fights<br />and blood and continuity.
1704620 1709205 And so a lot of the things<br />were made and then distressed
1709291 1713626 to look like they had come<br />from vintage stores and thrift shops.
1736068 1739732 (Jeff) These scenes,<br />especially in David's movies,
1739947 1743781 the approach to these sequences<br />are so sophisticated, you don't realize
1743867 1748612 how many layers of people or action<br />it takes to finish a sequence.
1749414 1753658 For example, the car crash is done...
1754044 1759665 probably over nine days during the course<br />of the movie, in about six different places,
1759967 1761958 to arrive at that one sequence.
1762219 1766554 So, with clothing,<br />we may have five different people
1766640 1769803 wearing them for various reasons.
1772062 1777023 (Michael) The red leather jacket that Brad's<br />wearing, I think we had about six of them.
1777401 1780234 It looks like a great find in a thrift shop,
1780320 1783813 but the leather had to be dyed to get
1783907 1788276 that old kind of late-'603, early-703 color
1788954 1792413 and the texture of the leather<br />and the topstitching.
1792499 1795412 A lot of details went into making it look
1795502 1798790 like something<br />that I couldn't have possibly found
1798880 1801542 in a store today in that quantity.
1804177 1806088 (Jeff) Did he keep<br />any of the leather jackets?
1806179 1808841 (Michael) Uh... He wants one.
1808932 1813426 The wardrobe is actually still on hold,<br />but I have to remember to get him one.
1813645 1817138 He did get one of his black jackets<br />from Se7en.
1879795 1884631 (Kevin) The other single-frame thing, by the<br />way, that came up and is kind of funny
1884716 1886457 is the penis shot,
1886551 1892092 or the dirt that you see<br />at the end of the movie.
1892182 1897177 So at the very end of the movie,<br />we had to work something in there
1897729 1900221 to show that Brad's still<br />the ghost in the machine,
1900315 1902727 so we spliced that one in there.
1902984 1906397 What was funny was<br />that we never knew where this came from,
1906488 1909355 because Peter Mavromates<br />found us some pornography.
1909449 1910905 I guess he has his sources,
1910992 1913905 'cause on The Game<br />he had to find some pornography.
1913995 1919786 He came back with a 70mm frame<br />of a guy with not quite a hard-on -
1919876 1923210 you couldn't really have a hard-on<br />in an American movie.
1923505 1925587 We'd bug him about where it came from -
1925674 1928587 and where did they<br />screen 70mm pornography?
1928677 1930714 Anyway, so we got one frame of that,
1930804 1932886 which we had to crop and fit,<br />and put it in there
1932973 1934134 and we had to make it anamorphic
1934224 1936932 and stretch it back out again<br />and show the edges.
1937018 1940181 We had one of the editors<br />make up a dirty splice
1940272 1944311 so we could see what a dirty splice<br />looked like and match it on this frame.
1944401 1946893 It's in there for 15 frames or so<br />as it slips by.
1947988 1951401 But that was the end<br />of the single-frame events.
1963462 1965078 I don't know if it actually ever happened,
1965172 1970633 but we were convinced some projectionist<br />would cross the movie over right there.
1970719 1972630 He'd see the first one, go, "Fuck!",
1972721 1976430 cross the movie over<br />and wipe out the end of reel two.
1976892 1978223 But anyway...
1978310 1983521 (Jeff) The interior<br />of the theater that Tyler works in
1983607 1988477 where he splices his<br />pornography into children's films
1988570 1994987 was the fantastically old Art Deco theater<br />in downtown Los Angeles.
1995076 1999946 It's being renovated right now.<br />It's probably done now.
2000248 2004162 Which you don't actually<br />get to appreciate in Fight Club.
2004252 2008541 However, we used...<br />My gaffer's name is Claudio Miranda
2008632 2011875 and he's created this light source<br />called a DecaSource,
2012177 2015966 and it's MR16s all in rows of pods,
2016056 2019549 and you can put them<br />on a computerized dimmer board
2019643 2022305 and actually have them pulsating slightly -
2022395 2027356 that created the projector glimmer<br />that you saw back off the people's faces.
2027442 2030855 So that's what we used,<br />with a few different colorations on it,
2030946 2035816 so you could feel the difference<br />of light quality when it hits them.
2035909 2039243 And then I believe<br />we used a projector beam.
2039496 2041237 I think we used a Xenon in the back
2041331 2044449 and we created our own<br />projector feeling through it,
2044543 2048707 so when you shot backwards you saw<br />the backlight coming through their heads.
2050590 2053753 It was at the theater entrance,<br />not the projection booth.
2053843 2056380 It was too high<br />and wouldn't hit the people's heads.
2056471 2060635 So it was another Hollywood cheat.
2061226 2066312 (Michael) I love that scene when Brad is<br />waiting tables at the hotel banquet room
2066398 2068184 and he's wearing a Walkman.
2068275 2073145 That really cracks me up.<br />It's so Tyler Durden.
2097304 2101719 (Jeff) There's something<br />about the sound that they chose to use
2101808 2105267 for the thump of the first hit<br />when Edward hits Brad
2105353 2108812 that just cracks me up every time.
2109232 2111519 It's such a pathetic attempt at a fight,
2111610 2115274 and then the sound itself<br />is just this dead thump.
2118491 2122735 Lou's Bar, the exterior of Lou's Tavern,<br />was down in Long Beach,
2122829 2129166 and the idea behind shooting it there was<br />to get this industrial, isolated background
2129252 2133211 with the harbor lights in the background.
2133465 2135547 In wider shots, you can see that.
2135634 2139252 Especially the first time<br />you see the Paper Street house,
2139679 2142967 you see all the factory lights<br />in the background,
2143099 2147388 which, once again,<br />was shooting the spherical 35.
2148521 2153186 I don't believe you could have picked up<br />the intensity of those lights or the depth,
2153276 2155938 had we used anamorphic glass.
2160367 2164406 I think every picture would want<br />to tell you what it wants to be,
2164496 2169332 and this particular one, because of the<br />style that we chose to photograph it in,
2169417 2174162 it definitely was an asset to us<br />to use spherical glass,
2174422 2181089 to have the luxury of being able to shoot<br />500 or 800 ASA stocks at a 1.9 or a 2 stop.
2181471 2183633 We actually didn't shoot any 800 ASA.
2183723 2189344 We used 5279 for all the night exteriors<br />and night interiors
2189437 2194853 and then used 5248<br />for all of our day exteriors.
2197487 2200696 (Michael) The detail<br />in the Paper Street house is so amazing.
2200782 2207779 Even the wooden stairway<br />is more worn in the center.
2209666 2215662 I mean, just little details that, you know,<br />a lot of them the film didn't even pick up.
2216214 2219673 We went to Long Beach and saw<br />this house that wasn't there before.
2219759 2225300 They'd just built the exterior of the house<br />and matched the interior so beautifully.
2225640 2231977 (Jeff) We scouted the house several times<br />as it was growing to its completion.
2232480 2238726 And the story from some of<br />the construction guys
2238820 2240652 that had been there for most of the time
2240739 2246826 is that there's a planned freeway that goes<br />right through the lot we built the house in.
2246911 2249949 I guess that's why we were able<br />to use the lot.
2250123 2253707 And as they saw this house going up,<br />they kept coming by, going:
2253793 2256751 "You guys know they're gonna<br />build a freeway here, right?"
2256838 2258374 (laughter)
2259883 2261874 "No. We had no idea."
2278485 2280271 A lot of the night exteriors,
2280361 2284776 especially around<br />the Paper Street house and Lou's Tavern,
2285241 2291704 we used these 8K<br />tungsten helium balloons.
2294501 2298620 They have their own light source inside<br />and you fill them with the helium
2298713 2302456 and they blow up to...<br />probably a good 1 Oft diameter.
2302550 2306714 Then you can hoist them up in the middle<br />of the sequence, the middle of your shot.
2307180 2310138 The tag lines are all blackened out<br />and they disappear
2310225 2315186 and it creates<br />a wonderful moonlit ambience
2315271 2317558 to a large area.
2319400 2325646 It's rather... At that point, there wasn't<br />anything to cut that source with.
2325740 2331486 And now, since then, you can hang<br />different material on the backs
2331579 2334571 to make the light more directional.
2334666 2338159 But it was just a large, broad source<br />and kind of went everywhere.
2338253 2342497 It gave you a good base. Then you'd put<br />your keys in and your backlight from that.
2343091 2346425 But it helped enormously<br />to light large areas.
2346803 2349420 I know they come in various sizes
2349514 2352506 but, had we not had our spherical lenses,
2352600 2355888 we would have had to have<br />a much larger light source than that.
2355979 2362567 It just worked out now that, at 500 ASA,<br />with the balloon at about 30ft in the air,
2362652 2367988 you'd have a nice 1.4, 1.5,<br />and we were shooting at 2, 2.3.
2368074 2372489 So you had a great 2 stop under ambience<br />that carried a large area
2372620 2374611 and gives you some really nice depth
2374706 2377824 in the ground and sides<br />of buildings and whatnot.
2378084 2381247 Then, fortunately for me,<br />because at that time
2381337 2383203 we weren't able to cut<br />the back of the light off,
2383298 2387166 it also front-lights<br />buildings you may not want lit.
2387635 2392220 But because of the way<br />that Alex had aged the buildings down -
2392307 2395800 usually they were decrepit<br />and dark in tone anyways -
2395894 2397555 we didn't have to worry about cutting it.
2397645 2401809 If anything, the spill helped. Otherwise<br />the buildings would have disappeared.
2402233 2405316 Plus the creative use of a stand-by painter.
2405403 2407235 We had a great stand-by painter
2407322 2411316 by the name of Billy Hoyt<br />on this picture, and any time...
2411409 2415448 We initially lit Lou's Tavern<br />and we used the ball for the wider shots
2415538 2417529 to give an ambiance to the parking lot.
2417874 2420366 It lit the roof of the building way too much.
2420460 2423327 So he just hops up with a spray gun and,
2423421 2427289 down two notches,<br />the building disappears.
2431304 2433591 I had about six weeks to prep,
2433681 2436264 of which about half the time<br />was spent visiting the locations
2436351 2439685 and going over the sets<br />and talking with Alex
2439771 2443856 about plans for the Paper Street house
2443942 2447230 and how to approach<br />practical light sources
2447320 2448810 and windows that allowed us to light,
2448905 2453194 and ceilings, whether<br />they were to be fixed or not fixed.
2453618 2458704 For the Paper Street house we decided<br />to opt for a real two-storey house
2458790 2463705 as opposed to splitting the two levels<br />on a sound stage and having false ceilings.
2464045 2467538 My attitude about that - something<br />I watched my father do so well -
2467632 2471500 is, if you're put into a realistic situation
2471594 2473631 without the comfort<br />of taking away a ceiling
2473721 2476759 and then putting light sources in<br />that don't really exist,
2477016 2483558 that then you creatively have to come<br />to terms with the space that you have
2483648 2487482 and it becomes<br />a much more natural feeling.
2487568 2492313 You can't cheat as much, and I didn't want<br />to have the luxury of being able to cheat.
2492407 2494774 Fortunately it worked out<br />for David and Alex
2494867 2496653 because it saved a lot of space<br />on the stage.
2497120 2499407 And rather than having two houses,<br />two floor plans,
2499497 2501579 we put them on top of each other.
2501791 2508504 And it forces you to be more honest<br />with your light, for better or worse.
2511300 2514543 The Long Beach set<br />was just the facade of a house,
2514637 2520929 but the actual house that we built<br />on stage at Fox was two storeys.
2521394 2524512 And so you're forced to deal with
2524605 2528439 those dilemmas, which I feel...
2528526 2530858 If you watch the picture,
2530945 2536065 you don't disbelieve the light sources<br />or the directions that they're coming from.
2536159 2538150 So that was our goal.
2563436 2568647 Down in the basement of Lou's Tavern,<br />where the Fight Club initiates,
2568775 2571767 it was interesting because<br />we'd strategically placed
2571861 2573977 a few light sources around the room
2574072 2577281 so that it could basically<br />have a pseudo-boxing ring
2577366 2582076 with a lot of fall-off in the backgrounds,<br />not much depth.
2582455 2588167 And we had one work light,
2588252 2595249 like a metal, domed, household, clip-on<br />work light that you'd see in a lot of places.
2595760 2599128 It was such a beautiful light source
2599222 2601805 and made such sense<br />that they'd have it in this place
2601891 2603973 that we stole a bunch of them<br />from the kitchen
2604060 2606392 of the Paper Street house next door
2606729 2610518 and ended up using them<br />throughout the whole movie.
2610858 2615477 We nicknamed them "budget-busters"<br />since they were only $3 apiece to put in.
2615655 2619819 Basically, all of Lou's basement,<br />where the fighting takes place,
2619992 2622484 minus this one fluorescent,
2622578 2625866 are all lit by these little budget-busters.
2675923 2680963 This is the first picture that<br />I photographed from head to toe as the DP.
2681220 2687341 I had worked on both Se7en<br />and The Game as a second-unit DP
2687435 2690848 and had done some operating<br />on the first unit of Se7en
2690938 2695899 and shot quite a bit of<br />second-unit insert work on The Game
2696360 2701105 and assumed that<br />my meeting with David was
2701199 2703486 about shooting second-unit for Fight Club.
2703576 2709322 So I was kind of taken aback when<br />he asked me to shoot the picture for him.
2738611 2741228 (Doc) The computer can do a lot of stuff.
2741322 2745862 Every year, as software gets better,<br />as technical knowledge gets better,
2745952 2748193 there will be more<br />and more breakthroughs
2748287 2750824 and experiments,<br />more and more things tried.
2751332 2755291 The danger with computer animation<br />and digital effects
2755378 2758962 is that you see too much, often times.
2759507 2763717 And there's a lot that goes wrong<br />with computers, a lot that looks wrong.
2763803 2766511 There's a lot of artifacts<br />and strange things in there
2766597 2770306 and people don't always know<br />how to correct for those.
2770810 2774269 I don't know everything about<br />correcting for digital artifacts.
2774355 2779850 And, honestly, you don't always have the<br />time to make things look absolutely real.
2780528 2783611 So you are dealing with approximations<br />all the time,
2783698 2787737 and those approximations are getting<br />smaller and smaller as time goes on.
2788160 2791619 However, the demands<br />upon the artists are being
2791706 2793572 made greater and greater all the time.
2793666 2795998 There's stuff being done now that could
2796085 2798873 scarcely have been dreamed of<br />five years ago.
2799297 2803256 So it's kind of amazing to think
2803342 2805709 what might happen<br />five or ten years down the line.
2805803 2811173 I think that there's still many stages<br />of revolution and evolution to come.
2811517 2813849 Imagine computers that, for example,
2813936 2818555 might be 10,000 times faster<br />or more powerful
2818649 2819889 than the ones that we're using now.
2819984 2822100 How is that gonna change things?
2847428 2852844 (Jeff) This is a perfect example of a phone<br />conversation between Marla and Jack
2852933 2858144 when she's laying on the bed there and<br />she does have a skin irritation going on.
2858230 2861393 And we went with it.<br />We thought it fit her character.
2861484 2864602 And she certainly wanted<br />to go as opposite
2864695 2869906 her Victorian stereotype as she could.
2874872 2880083 (Michael) Although she's all dressed up,<br />seemingly so, wearing a sequined dress
2880169 2883207 which looks like it maybe<br />came from the '603,
2884298 2890419 the fabric, of course,<br />when we made it, was perfect.
2890513 2893426 And so what I did was
2893516 2898386 I shaved the sequins off in different areas
2898479 2902222 so it looked really tattered.
2902316 2905274 And also, you know, it was kind of sexy
2905361 2909229 showing parts of her body,<br />'cause it was unlined.
2912284 2916573 (Jeff) The lovemaking<br />sequence in this movie
2917790 2919497 is such an interesting choice and style
2919583 2921574 that shows all the passion<br />without showing
2921669 2925037 all the detail of actually, you know, sex.
2925131 2928374 And so I thought it was a brilliant choice.
2929635 2933879 (Kevin) That was one of those things<br />we started very early in prep,
2933973 2938467 and literally almost the last scene to be<br />delivered was one of the sex sequences.
2938644 2943229 In the end we had to deliver it all as one<br />continuous piece, which caused problems.
2943399 2945606 It was all the usual boring CG things.
2945693 2948276 Once you'd decided that,<br />while you're gonna
2948362 2950478 make everything fit together in one piece,
2950573 2954407 then David could think of<br />new transitions between the two.
2954493 2956450 It got very intricate.
2956620 2960614 It's a little disappointing<br />that it goes by in nothing flat.
2960791 2964705 It was supposed to be shorter,<br />like a blipvert, where every cut...
2964795 2968288 I think six cuts made it.<br />Every cut was three seconds long.
2968382 2971124 And they ended up as long<br />as seven or eight seconds.
2971427 2973634 But now you can't tell<br />they're moving because
2973721 2975712 three seconds of motion spread over eight
2975806 2978013 starts to look like you're not moving.
2978100 2980387 We added ashtrays flying through the air
2980478 2983766 so you could see things falling.<br />Things like that.
2984315 2987899 Anyway, it was a lot of fun.<br />It was a lot of hair-pulling on my part.
2987985 2991398 But hopefully, the result...<br />The result is beautiful.
2991489 2994231 I don't know how well it integrates<br />into the rest of the movie,
2994325 2996407 but it stands out on its own.
2996577 3001162 It's the only time we see sex in the movie,<br />so it can be a little different to the rest.
3001248 3005333 Part of the rule of working<br />with David in visual effects
3005419 3008161 is that they have to look like<br />they're part of the movie.
3008255 3010917 He has a lot of experience.<br />He used to work at ILM.
3011008 3017004 He knows about effects that go out in<br />second units and come back looking great
3017097 3019930 and having nothing to do with the movie.
3020309 3025645 So number one is to try to make sure that<br />it fits well and it looks like everything else.
3025940 3029683 And I tend to get dragged into<br />all sorts of other technical things.
3029777 3032519 There's this weird crossover<br />between me and post
3032780 3035363 where Peter Mavromates,<br />the post supervisor,
3035449 3038191 is very involved in stuff<br />post supervisors usually are not
3038285 3042404 and I'm involved in stuff that<br />post supervisors are, and we kind of mesh,
3042498 3046992 because David wants it all to fit<br />so it's a tight-fit kind of thing.
3051215 3055630 (Alex) We matched downtown hotel with...
3056303 3060217 In fact, we went and found a bunch of<br />downtown hotels that we liked the look of,
3060307 3062344 and then we found a lobby that we liked,
3062685 3068397 and then we took paint<br />into the real location
3068482 3069938 to match some of<br />the other places we liked
3070025 3073563 and then took<br />the combined look of that onto stage.
3073654 3079650 So the corridor right by her room is stage<br />and everything else is location downstairs.
3081537 3083744 We built this room on stage,
3084915 3090206 based it on the worst of downtown
3090296 3092788 monthly rental hotels that we found
3093716 3096925 and then took the look<br />of what we liked of those
3097011 3101630 and added paint<br />in the location that we found.
3101724 3106969 So the lobby and the stairways<br />was a hotel on Eighth Street, downtown.
3108522 3114017 But we added the shine on the corridor<br />and the floor, pulled up carpet.
3118198 3123113 (Michael) Wasn't that the night somebody<br />threw a bottle out of a window at Jeff?
3123203 3124443 (Alex) Hit you on the head.
3124538 3130033 (Jeff) Yeah. The exterior that night<br />of that hotel, Marla's hotel,
3130586 3134580 one evening, in the middle of the night,<br />as we were shooting down there,
3134673 3139008 apparently we alienated<br />one of the residents of that hotel
3139094 3143088 and he lobbed a 40oz beer bottle<br />out the window
3143182 3150179 and it just happened to clock me on the<br />head as I was standing next to the camera.
3150356 3152848 (Michael) Good aim!<br />(Jeff) Very good aim.
3152941 3156479 Did you see my shirt afterwards?<br />You'd appreciate it.
3156570 3158527 Wonderful pattern all over it.
3158906 3163992 Yeah, I didn't get to finish that night.<br />I spent it in the hospital.
3164078 3166740 But... it all worked out.
3167665 3169997 (Alex) Downtown's a war zone.<br />(Jeff) Yeah.
3170084 3173418 So we all experienced<br />a little bit of our own Fight Club.
3173587 3176420 I have a scar to show for it.
3176715 3179207 We had our own set officers on the set
3179301 3182043 who apprehended the guy<br />that threw the bottle.
3182137 3186506 But the local police that showed up,<br />as I was covered with beer
3186600 3191140 and I'm sitting there with a pack on my<br />head waiting for an ambulance to show up,
3191647 3194685 his first question is,<br />"Have you been drinking?"
3194775 3196061 (laughter)
3196151 3199485 I wanted to leap at him at that point.
3208497 3212365 (Michael) Tyler's lavender bathrobe<br />with the coffee cups was a huge hit.
3212459 3218546 In fact, I got a call from Edward<br />this past November
3218632 3224127 asking if I could have another one made up<br />for his brother for a Christmas gift.
3226181 3229719 I think it belonged to...<br />The original one - we had more copied -
3229810 3233929 but the original one<br />came from Brad's housekeeper.
3249204 3253323 (Alex) This basement set<br />was built in a tank, on stage.
3253834 3255245 (Jeff) This whole sequence,
3255335 3259249 the fact that the Paper Street house<br />had a faulty electrical system
3259339 3262582 and forced the occupants,<br />Brad and Edward,
3262676 3266169 to turn off the fuse box when it rained
3266555 3268091 created an interesting scenario since,
3268182 3272267 when you switch off the power,<br />what's left, right?
3272436 3276680 We applied interesting uses of flashlights,
3276774 3279766 candles and some moonlight.
3280027 3283520 (Alex) We had to work all that out<br />from the outside, I remember.
3283614 3286026 Had to have enough gaps built into...
3286116 3289359 The house was supposed<br />to be boarded up and abandoned,
3289453 3293788 so no light was supposed to get in<br />because they're in there subversively
3293874 3296536 and not letting anyone on the street<br />know they're there.
3296627 3300871 So you couldn't show a lot of light<br />coming in from the outside.
3333747 3338207 (Jeff) We talked earlier, Alex, about<br />the exterior of the Paper Street house
3338293 3341001 and the enormous undertaking it was<br />to build that facade
3341088 3347300 and how some of the local characters told<br />you about the freeway that was going in.
3347553 3350215 (Alex) It was funny 'cause it went up sort of
3350305 3352262 backwards in time,<br />'cause it went up brand-new,
3352349 3356559 and people would say, "You shouldn't<br />be building a house in this neighborhood
3356645 3359933 cause they're about to<br />take this area out for the Port of LA."
3360440 3361851 So we said, "I think we'll be all right."
3361942 3364525 As it got older, people would say:
3364611 3368149 "I've lived here 25 years.<br />I had no idea this house was here."
3368240 3370151 (laughter)
3370242 3373360 We had bus tours going by
3373745 3375577 But there was always someone every day
3375664 3379623 who came in, totally innocent,<br />and said, "No idea."
3379918 3383081 (Jeff) I think it settled down<br />after the UFO sighting -
3383171 3386789 the moonballs that we had<br />lighting the area.
3388135 3389967 (Alex) A local San Pedro historian
3390053 3395139 wanted us to give a talk to his historical<br />society about the Victorian house.
3395559 3400895 We built the porch, and one wall<br />of the kitchen was built on location.
3400981 3404099 Then we brought the entire piece<br />back to stage
3404192 3408561 so that you could get those shots<br />of the garden and match,
3408739 3410821 and bring people in from the outside.
3411074 3414066 (Jeff) For example,<br />the two times Marla leaves the house
3414161 3415367 and walks through the yard,
3415454 3419448 or when some of the space monkeys<br />are gardening.
3479351 3483219 (Michael) I thought<br />a bridesmaid's dress would be easy to find
3483313 3485805 because they're in all the thrift shops.
3485899 3488231 But to find one that felt right
3488485 3493901 and had the qualities that were<br />in the dialog was impossible.
3494074 3499240 And something that seemed<br />like Marla would pick out for herself
3499663 3502155 and related to her other clothing.
3502374 3505833 They were all too cheap-looking<br />or not enough detail.
3505919 3508160 So we ended up having to make this one
3508547 3512290 and then burned cigarette holes in it<br />and dragged it through the mud
3512384 3516628 and made it look like<br />it's what she was talking about.
3552758 3557844 You can catch Brad's bunny-rabbit slippers<br />going up the stairs there.
3558263 3561381 Another thing<br />about Brad's character, his...
3561475 3567266 If you notice, his pants are always hanging<br />around as low as possible on his waist.
3567355 3573101 This was a characteristic that,<br />you know, was conscious,
3573320 3579783 and he always has a little bit of plumber's<br />butt if you catch him from the back.
3593048 3598634 This outfit was Tyler's idea<br />of a complete camouflage outfit.
3598720 3603339 In fact, when Brad was outside,<br />he was even trying to hide among trees,
3603433 3605515 thinking, since he was<br />wearing a leaf pattern,
3605602 3609721 that it was, in essence,<br />natural camouflage.
3650522 3654516 The reason for the camouflage<br />was Tyler's little caper here.
3654943 3658902 -He didn't want to be noticed.<br />-(Alex) He looks perfectly camouflaged.
3658989 3660980 (Michael) So he's wearing orange.
3661074 3662610 (laughs)
3662826 3668993 (Alex) The prop master, Bucky Moore,<br />brought in some real liposuction
3669416 3672454 just to show David<br />what it really looked like.
3672752 3676916 (Michael) That was an example<br />of why we need multiples for clothing.
3680177 3682635 (Jeff) It ended up like a combination of
3682721 3685884 chicken broth and<br />parts and different things.
3685974 3690138 (Alex) Yeah. Actually,<br />I don't remember what he finally put in it.
3690228 3693892 (Jeff) Some concoction.<br />(Alex) Really disgusting.
3716338 3717419 We chose a Victorian house
3717505 3723547 I think mainly because every room had to<br />have at least three entrances and exits
3723637 3726846 for Marla and Brad to do their dance
3726932 3730766 where neither one of them<br />was in the same room at the same time.
3730852 3733310 Or rather, Brad and Edward, I guess.
3733521 3737139 And as well that it was<br />a very clean 100-year span.
3737234 3740397 So this house represented the history of
3740487 3742728 the 20th century<br />and what it had gone through
3742822 3749819 and became, I guess, a sort of a symbol for<br />the Tyler character's Luddite principles.
3751665 3756159 We imagined that it was something built<br />by a captain of industry
3756253 3759587 in a rich neighborhood,
3759673 3764133 but the industry that made him rich
3764219 3766631 got closer and closer<br />encroached on the buildings
3766721 3771932 so that, gradually,<br />the buildings began to be deserted.
3772018 3776307 So his grandson
3776398 3779766 had to sublet the house in the 703.
3780735 3786401 So we cut the house in half and worked<br />out which rooms he could have sublet.
3786533 3791903 An additional kitchen and bathroom<br />and a backstairs were built in the 705,
3791997 3798039 and there's the plush carpet<br />and the Mylar wallpaper.
3798128 3801496 Half the house was<br />totally refurbished in the 705.
3801965 3805879 Then that plan didn't work and<br />he still couldn't afford to keep the house.
3805969 3808961 So he let it go, and then it was squatted.
3809055 3814050 And there's sort of a layer of<br />graffiti and squatting of pre-Tyler day,
3814394 3818103 and then the security was put on it<br />and the fence was put around it.
3818189 3823605 And finally, Tyler got through the fence,<br />broke into the house and squatted it again.
3824112 3829073 But it has these many layers built into it.
3829367 3834407 We've got burn marks on the walls<br />where previous squatters had lit fires
3834497 3839367 and, of course, all this time it's rotting,
3839461 3845924 so the rain's pouring through<br />and the wallpaper's rotting away.
3871201 3875195 (Michael) This is Tyler's<br />idea of business attire
3875288 3881580 when he goes to Barney's<br />to sell them the soap which he's made.
3908405 3911067 (Alex) This whole Corporate America,
3911157 3916448 we went for the most bland possible
3916538 3919496 colors and environments.
3920041 3926583 I think almost all on Wilshire Boulevard,<br />we got most of Corporate America there.
3942897 3946606 Those blinds were closed all the time,<br />and we actually had a view out.
3946693 3951904 (Jeff) We did at one point have a slight<br />view. In one sequence you see the trees.
4002874 4006412 (Alex) This is that Eighth Street hotel.
4006711 4010079 (Michael) It's pretty hideous,<br />especially at night-time.
4010507 4014796 When we were shooting The Game,<br />there were a lot of alley scenes.
4014886 4016923 One of my assistants heard a crunch
4017013 4019755 as she ran to the set<br />with a shirt somebody needed,
4019849 4024093 and she looked down<br />and she had stepped on a rat's head.
4027190 4030774 (Jeff) Well, it doubles<br />as anywhere in America,
4030860 4035149 and it has so much<br />gritty detail down there
4035240 4039029 because so many of the buildings<br />are vacant and have been so for so long.
4039118 4044454 And there's such a level of dilapidation<br />that it's beautiful to shoot in.
4044541 4046999 It's uncomfortable, but it's beautiful.
4047293 4049910 (Alex) The architecture's<br />wonderful downtown.
4050004 4052041 There's nowhere else<br />in America that I've seen
4052131 4055840 that has such little respect<br />for architecture -
4055927 4057884 for period architecture.
4058513 4064429 So you get the most ugly buildings<br />next to the most beautiful buildings.
4064519 4068604 Also, downtown's interesting<br />'cause it really only exists at ground level
4068690 4070806 in the center.
4071234 4075148 Most of the buildings are dead shells<br />on the main streets in downtown,
4075238 4077696 from the ground floor up.
4078491 4082985 People never look up, and that's where<br />all the beautiful architecture is.
4083079 4089166 But we spent months going in and out<br />of these hotels in the location scouts.
4089252 4090367 (Michael) So many<br />times I worked downtown
4090461 4094079 with David and I'd look up and realize
4094173 4099464 that it was a location from Blade Runner<br />many years before with Ridley.
4099554 4103013 And I think there's<br />a similar sensibility there.
4158738 4160024 (Alex) This was a fabulous location -
4160114 4165154 an office building that was gutted,<br />ready for renewal,
4165411 4170747 for being retrofitted<br />with all the ugly '905 stuff.
4171542 4173499 (Jeff) Alex is talking about a fight
4173586 4175577 between Edward's character
4175672 4180382 and Meat Loaf's character<br />when they meet again.
4181219 4187010 We used practical rope strings,<br />construction lights in a row,
4188643 4190509 that just happened to be there.
4190603 4194312 We liked the way they looked and<br />incorporated them into that sequence.
4194399 4198643 They look great<br />and are lighting the sequence,
4198736 4202695 minus the fact that there's<br />one or two fluorescents in the background.
4203991 4206028 It just fit in with the motif<br />of using as many
4206119 4210408 practical and realistic<br />light sources we can.
4210665 4215375 (Alex) We spent a lot of time looking<br />at the possibilities of industrial lighting,
4215461 4219500 and giving each kind of lighting<br />a character for each area.
4219716 4225132 I think that work-light aesthetic<br />came back into the top floor high-rise,
4225221 4226837 carried on through there.
4227098 4232093 (Jeff) And I was laughing about the use<br />of what we nicknamed budget-busters,
4232186 4236305 the little domed metal lights that we used<br />throughout, like in the kitchen,
4236399 4240734 and then eventually<br />in the basement of Lou's Tavern.
4244657 4248992 (Michael) In this fight scene,<br />Brad's wearing a shirt that I found...
4249078 4250568 Not the one I found in a thrift shop,
4250663 4253655 I found a similar shirt<br />in a thrift shop from the '603.
4253750 4259416 On it, it says, "Sock it to me."<br />And when Brad saw it, he flipped.
4259505 4265501 I think it's a line from<br />the old Laugh-In show.
4266554 4273051 And we knew that we needed, like,<br />a dozen shirts for this scene,
4273144 4277433 and Brad kind of really,<br />really wanted to wear it.
4277523 4283610 And so I spent the weekend<br />silk-screening T-shirts for him.
4284572 4289692 Not only silk-screening, but making them,<br />silk-screening them, dyeing them,
4290411 4293995 and kind of replicating the one he<br />loved so much that I'd found, you know,
4294081 4297494 the Friday before the Monday<br />when this was to shoot.
4303633 4309754 (Alex) This basement is a set matching
4309847 4312805 the location that we found<br />down in San Pedro,
4312892 4315054 which was very close<br />to the Paper Street house.
4315436 4321603 The bar, Lou's Tavern, obviously<br />didn't have a basement, being LA.
4322068 4326403 So we took the same floor plan<br />and imagined a kind of concrete space,
4326489 4329982 although it wouldn't really have had that.
4392471 4396180 (Jeff) Michael worked on Blade Runner.<br />(Michael) With your dad.
4396267 4399726 With my dad, yeah.<br />We were talking about it earlier.
4400062 4403054 (Michael) That was an<br />incredible experience.
4406110 4408977 I was very young and, you know,
4409071 4415408 just working with a visionary
4415494 4416484 like Ridley
4416579 4421540 was a pretty amazing education<br />at that point in my career.
4421626 4424960 I mean, it's hard to find futuristic clothes.
4425671 4429380 (Jeff) Nowadays everything's auctioned off<br />afterwards, right?
4429467 4435338 (Michael) I heard this story that... Now<br />we're talking about Blade Runner, but...
4435640 4439850 They took all the clothes to England<br />to do reshoots,
4439936 4445022 and rather than store them or send them<br />back, and go through Customs again,
4445107 4449772 they just burned them all,<br />which I have trouble believing.
4449862 4451444 But that's the story,<br />and I've never seen any of
4451530 4455865 the clothes in my travels<br />through the studios.
4479558 4485304 (Doc) Personally, I like using a computer<br />to create sort of new worlds,
4485398 4487810 and I use it as a design tool.
4488401 4492235 I am now sort of figuring out<br />how to use the computer
4492321 4494107 and I've gotten good enough at it
4494198 4497657 where I can do the stuff I did<br />with the optical printer in college
4498869 4500655 on my computer now.
4500746 4504410 And so I've sort of caught up, in a sense,
4504500 4509836 to the artistic and technical level that<br />I was at in college with this computer.
4509922 4513961 And now I'm sort of taking off,<br />starting off now,
4514051 4516167 where I left off back in art school.
4516262 4520677 And I've been very fortunate in having<br />some directors and some projects
4520766 4526978 that have given me free rein and<br />given me a lot of freedom to experiment,
4527064 4531649 and to use some of my design skills<br />and some of my ideas and imagination.
4532069 4538361 I'm also kind of... I am not<br />a real big fan of the philosophy
4538451 4545039 that work should be design-driven<br />or story-driven.
4545124 4547331 I'm in sort of a minority group
4548044 4551582 that believes that<br />software drives the creative decisions,
4551797 4558134 that software, by its existence, opens up<br />new possibilities to experiment with.
4558304 4560636 If I had to do it over again,<br />I think I probably
4560723 4563806 would have studied more programing
4564351 4567719 when I was getting started,<br />'cause I'm doing more programing now,
4567813 4572398 and I feel like a lot of the art<br />is in the programers' hands now,
4572485 4576649 not entirely in the technicians'<br />or the artists' hands.
4576989 4581734 And that's kind of a funny realization.
4582661 4585119 And people like Con Pederson will spend
4585206 4589666 as much time re-programing the<br />computer or writing new software for it
4589752 4593541 as he will trying to design something<br />or develop a new technique for it.
4593631 4595747 He'll go under the hood<br />to get the computer
4595841 4598333 to do something it hasn't done before,
4598427 4602762 and then use that as a creative tool
4602848 4605715 to design something<br />that nobody's ever seen before.
4605810 4608222 So I believe that<br />you can work it both ways.
4608312 4611430 The creative and design side<br />can push software development,
4611524 4615563 but I also think very strongly that<br />the software developers and programers
4616153 4621273 can offer up tools to the designers that<br />they never would have thought of before.
4653440 4657980 (Jeff) A lot of the corporate locations<br />or sets that we found ourselves in,
4658070 4664237 we did play that, you know...<br />Uncomfortable, unnatural light sources.
4668747 4673036 (Alex) I love the color of this scene. A lot<br />of the time, we didn't change the colors,
4673127 4678167 except in this case,<br />we put that green into this space,
4678966 4683551 'cause we were spending<br />enough time in here to justify it.
4684763 4687130 (Jeff) For a lot of the corporate sequences,
4687224 4692936 at least in Edward's office<br />and his boss's office,
4694106 4696347 we used...
4696442 4701858 we put in regular Chroma fluorescents.
4701947 4705986 It didn't correct anything,<br />it let cool light stay in there,
4706327 4711788 and then made slight adjustments<br />on the camera to get this kind of
4711916 4718128 forced, unnatural kind of greenish tonality<br />to their skins and to the walls.
4718339 4724255 We were kind of presenting this unfriendly<br />work environment that he lives in.
4724845 4729635 And that helped one way,<br />visually at least, to transcend that.
4729892 4733977 (Alex) And I think to suggest<br />that to really make it iconically
4734063 4740856 the way that Corporate America works<br />and try to really find the essence of that.
4741403 4746068 (Jeff) Yeah, and then, you know,<br />even intercut, so closely together,
4746158 4749446 it's such a contrast in Lou's Tavern<br />for the fight sequences,
4749536 4754497 which are all lit by these fairly warm<br />tungsten, small practical sources
4754583 4757325 that are placed in the ceilings.
4758712 4761295 In one way it brings you back to this,
4761382 4766092 their comfortable, wombish world,<br />even though fighting takes place here,
4766178 4771469 versus this sterile corporate world<br />that he's trying to...
4773727 4775593 push himself away from,
4776021 4777637 distance himself from.
4778107 4781020 (Alex) And something to do<br />with history as well, I think.
4781110 4783477 In the corporate world,<br />nothing exists there
4783570 4788610 that was built prior to 1980 kind of thing,
4788701 4792990 but in the Fight Club<br />and in the house, and in Marla's world,
4793330 4797119 the historical air is all there<br />and the warmth comes from that,
4797209 4803205 so the warmth in the light<br />and in the colors we were using
4803549 4807167 kind of helps exaggerate that separation.
4807261 4810799 (Jeff) It's like forced industry<br />versus this organic fight,
4810889 4815850 which brings them back to, you know...<br />in Brad's theory brings them back
4815936 4819179 to where we've gone<br />so far away from anyways.
4865277 4870397 (Alex) I think for us the interesting thing<br />about the characters in this film
4870491 4876407 is that they were kind of nonpeople,<br />you know, they had no personal history.
4876497 4879330 Very often, when you're doing a film,
4879792 4883911 you can track the history of a space<br />the person lives in because they live in it,
4884004 4889124 they've inhabited that space for years,<br />you have some sense of their history.
4889551 4894546 But in this case,<br />they're all ciphers in a way.
4894640 4900261 And so what we were able to do,<br />and kind of needed to do,
4900354 4907317 was build the characters from...<br />make the environments into characters
4907403 4912148 that supported those...<br />that told the story of those people.
4912408 4917494 Edward's environment is so much to do<br />with what he owns and where he lives,
4917579 4921914 and the IKEA world, and the filing cabinets
4922000 4926540 for widows and bachelors.
4926839 4931925 (Michael) Jack, Edward, and his boss,<br />they obviously live in the same world.
4932010 4934422 And it's just so mundane and boring,
4934513 4940259 and you understand the motivation<br />for Edward to need to get out of it.
4940644 4945309 And, you know, Tyler is<br />so effervescent and so colorful,
4945399 4949814 and you can understand the attraction,<br />and also, you know,
4950028 4954522 how polar these two characters are<br />from one another.
4954825 4957613 (Jeff) And I think collectively<br />we all accomplished something
4957703 4963415 in that every aspect of our contributions<br />adds to the story
4963500 4968916 without showboating or distracting<br />from the story element itself,
4969006 4973421 and photographically, that was one thing<br />I always admired about my father.
4973510 4975672 He never let ego get in the way.
4975762 4978345 You're always enhancing the story,
4978432 4981299 but within the context<br />of what the story's about,
4981393 4983384 and not something completely separate.
4983479 4987814 And it always bugs me when you have<br />this gritty, horrendous story
4987900 4991643 and this beautiful Disney,<br />Saturday-afternoon photography.
4991737 4997073 It just doesn't make sense,<br />and so I think that we accomplished that.
4998744 5002908 (Michael) I think the difficult thing about<br />Tyler's clothes being so flamboyant was
5002998 5008334 I'm so used to trying to have<br />the clothes remain in the background
5008420 5012129 and just kind of<br />maybe aid the character, you know,
5012216 5014173 but also kind of remain in their place.
5014259 5017968 And some of these clothes are a little bit
5018055 5019841 more attention-getting<br />than I'm used to doing,
5019932 5021639 and I kind of got nervous,
5021725 5025764 because when I'm too aware of<br />what the actors are wearing,
5025854 5030314 I feel like I'm not doing my job,<br />you know, it's almost like upstaging.
5030400 5034860 But Tyler was this character<br />that needed that kind of a presence,
5034947 5039487 and so it was necessary for me<br />to kind of stay on it,
5039576 5042364 and kind of push the character<br />and push the colors,
5042454 5046664 and the humor of what he was wearing.
5049044 5053254 (Alex) The clothes so much tell the story<br />in his character in that case.
5053674 5055665 I mean, they sort of stand alone in that.
5055759 5057045 (laughs)
5057135 5060378 (Jeff) It helps define who he is.<br />(Alex) The way they support him.
5060722 5065341 (Michael) It's interesting.<br />Last week's New York Times
5065561 5069475 had a whole article<br />about Donatella Versace,
5069731 5074976 picking up on the Fight Club atmosphere<br />and designing a whole...
5075070 5077732 Her whole fall collection for next year
5077823 5081282 is fashioned after Fight Club<br />and Tyler Durden.
5098010 5101298 A lot of people have said to me,<br />"Brad looks so great."
5101388 5103925 "But then again,<br />Brad looks great in anything he wears.
5104016 5107384 "It must be easy to dress him."
5107477 5109889 I think it is probably very easy<br />to dress Brad.
5109980 5112347 But that wasn't what we did.
5113650 5115857 He looks great in everything.<br />And so, in a way,
5115944 5120438 it was harder to make choices<br />that were right for the character.
5120532 5123149 It had nothing to do<br />with what was right for Brad.
5123243 5127407 We tried to whittle away at what<br />actually looked cool or looked good,
5127497 5132207 and kind of have things<br />that were only about the character,
5132294 5137710 or made a statement about the character<br />and the way he thought.
5137799 5140086 Such as the humor<br />behind the camouflage,
5140177 5143465 and little things that are<br />never really spoken about,
5143555 5146673 but just something that we liked,
5146767 5149509 you know, when we collaborated.
5152272 5155515 (Alex) Hopefully, you can<br />go back to this over and over again.
5155609 5160354 The great thing working the way<br />David works and with a story like this
5160447 5165237 is that there is so much richness to<br />the story that you can kind of run with it
5165327 5168115 and enjoy yourself, and build these layers,
5168205 5173996 the back story and the depth,<br />into every sort of environment.
5174086 5180128 And just... You know, you forget how<br />many things you put into these things.
5180217 5185132 And you look at it again and you can keep<br />getting more and more from the story
5185222 5189466 out of what you look at,<br />if you're given that opportunity.
5191436 5194770 (Michael) I think if an<br />actor is aware of the way
5194856 5198349 that the character is built with clothing,
5198443 5203483 whether or not the audience<br />realizes that the actors somehow
5204408 5208242 ideally become empowered in a way<br />about the character,
5208328 5212993 or, you know, where it might
5213083 5216201 help them find the character,
5216294 5222256 or deal with issues that<br />might not have presented themselves.
5224636 5229472 (Alex) It strikes me in this film, actually,<br />just thinking about what you're saying,
5229766 5232884 the clothing seems to be more like -
5232978 5237063 in this film - for Marla and for Tyler
5237149 5241564 that they're carrying their homes<br />with them on their backs, in a way.
5241653 5247524 Because neither one of them<br />has any effect on their environment at all.
5247701 5253697 For us, Marla, in her hotel room, there's<br />not a single object in the hotel room,
5253790 5257909 except the dildo, probably,<br />that is to do with her.
5258670 5261412 You imagine her entire life<br />could fit in a small suitcase,
5261506 5263588 and she could move at any moment.
5263675 5269296 And Tyler makes no attempt to affect<br />his environment, except for the kitchen.
5269389 5274384 The soap-making process.<br />But it's not to do with him
5274478 5277971 feeling more comfortable about<br />where he lives, whereas the clothing...
5278064 5282183 It seems like in a reality<br />their energy would go into
5282277 5287272 representing themselves through that,<br />and not through their environment.
5287365 5293611 Maybe in a normal film, that would be<br />at least probably opposite, I don't know.
5293914 5296872 Or at least equally to do<br />with the environment as the clothing.
5297042 5300660 (Michael) They're squatters in this scene.<br />(Alex) Totally, yeah.
5300837 5305582 And Edward, it's such a nonstyle that<br />he puts in that it doesn't have any effect.
5305675 5310670 Even if he's trying to order something<br />really different out of a catalog,
5310764 5312550 it's always the same catalog.
5313058 5320055 (Michael) Brad wears three or four different<br />styles of sunglasses throughout the movie.
5321566 5327687 They're all pretty outrageous.<br />These are his rose-colored glasses.
5331284 5336154 (Alex) This building opposite the lobby -<br />the entrance hall -
5336248 5341084 is a trucking company.
5341461 5343577 And we had a run-in with them, because
5343672 5346334 their drivers would always<br />park every night
5346424 5348256 outside the house while we were building
5348343 5352758 and leave gallon bottles<br />of urine on the sidewalk
5352973 5357558 for us to find in the morning -<br />when they've been driving all night.
5357936 5361600 They just unloaded. On the set.
5361773 5365687 (Jeff) It's the end of their run.<br />(Alex) Exactly.
5367696 5371781 (Michael) There's a scene where<br />Tyler tells the space monkeys that
5372075 5376615 once they're inaugurated<br />into, you know, "space monkeydom",
5376830 5379822 they need to show up with certain items.
5380041 5384911 The idea being that these people<br />are from all different walks of life,
5385005 5389090 and so, although he tells them all<br />to bring black shirt and black pants,
5389175 5395547 it would be, you know, maybe in one case<br />black suit pants, another case, black jeans,
5395640 5398849 and, in another case, black Versace pants.
5398935 5404021 And same thing throughout,<br />shoes, boots, shirts.
5404274 5407642 So, this was supposed to be<br />not just directed
5407736 5411400 at one social group or economic group.
5411489 5416780 This was lawyers and trash collectors<br />and teachers, and just everyone.
5416870 5420158 We tried to exemplify that<br />in the wardrobe.
5420957 5425417 (Alex) That up angle, did that end up being<br />on stage or on location? I've forgotten.
5425503 5430498 We built that to be shot on stage,<br />but I think... Maybe it did get...
5430592 5435837 (Michael) This is location.<br />(Alex) The up angle of him in the window?
5436264 5438426 (Jeff) That was on location, I believe.
5438516 5441383 (Alex) There was an<br />elaborate fold-down piece
5441478 5443264 that we took to stage in order to do that,
5443355 5445892 but I think it wasn't necessary.
5446024 5452020 (Jeff) No, we mostly shot the entrance<br />to the house, the feet and whatnot.
5452697 5456281 It's the only thing<br />we duplicated on stage, right?
5456368 5460202 Aside from what normally was planned,<br />the kitchen sequence and...
5460288 5462245 (Alex) Right.
5463333 5467042 (Michael) The makeup<br />on that bus driver's nose was so good.
5467128 5473124 I had no idea that it was a statement<br />about the expanding role of fight clubbers.
5473218 5474708 (laughter)
5496074 5500159 (Alex) We spent a month<br />trying to bleach this flag
5500912 5505827 to be a kind of Jasper Johns<br />white-on-white American flag.
5505917 5508204 Never got it all the way there, but...
5528273 5532437 (Jeff) I believe 128 days was<br />the original shooting schedule,
5532527 5534268 or what we shot actually.
5536281 5538613 One hundred and 38 days.
5539117 5545784 But ten of those days<br />were additional pickup shots and whatnot,
5546166 5549579 some three months<br />after we initially wrapped.
5551588 5554876 (Alex) It was interesting,<br />'cause David went into the shoot
5554966 5560177 knowing that he'd want to shoot that long,<br />and planning on ten-hour days.
5560263 5564131 And I know that our directive
5564225 5568389 was to save as much of our budget<br />as we could,
5568480 5573896 that basically, wherever possible the<br />budget went towards the shooting days,
5573985 5578821 —rather than towards, say, the sets.<br />-(Jeff) I think we all had that mindset.
5579032 5584118 (Michael) Did we shoot any ten-hour days?<br />(Jeff) We actually did. About half.
5584204 5587868 (Alex) Surprisingly.<br />(Jeff) The idea behind that was,
5588291 5590407 there were so many makeup changes.
5590502 5595668 Initially there were 32 between<br />the two lead characters, Edward and Brad,
5596091 5599300 and I think that probably grew<br />as time went on.
5599385 5603219 And we had so many short sequences<br />that took place in different locations.
5603348 5606306 And you lose so much time<br />making a company move
5606392 5610886 that if we kept it to ten-hour days and took<br />that overtime and applied it to more days,
5610980 5613438 we'd have a much more logical schedule,
5613525 5620397 and have some kind of normalcy to life.
5620824 5625193 And primarily, the way it worked for me<br />is that we would...
5625286 5631828 usually David, myself, the AD, the actors,<br />script supervisor, maybe Alex and Michael,
5631918 5634910 would get there before the crew got there
5635171 5638755 and block out the sequence for that day<br />and rehearse it.
5639008 5642296 Then by the time the crew showed up,<br />we'd do one last rehearsal,
5642387 5646051 let everybody see what's going on,<br />they'd go off to Makeup, and we'd light.
5646391 5649884 And basically,<br />we'd shoot for the next eight hours.
5881125 5884538 There's many layers<br />to the car crash sequence
5884629 5887041 and the driving sequence as it took place.
5887131 5890624 Initially it started<br />the first week of shooting.
5890718 5892208 Actually, before we even started shooting,
5892303 5896137 we did three nights of plate work to create
5896224 5898261 the background plates<br />for the process stuff,
5898351 5903517 and we went on an insert car<br />and went down by the airport area
5903606 5906439 then down into the Long Beach area to get
5906526 5910064 a transition from the city<br />to the desolate area,
5910154 5911940 where they have the impact.
5912156 5916901 We shot off of 3 insert car with a Wescam
5916994 5919326 on the back of the car<br />with a VistaVision camera
5919414 5924750 to give us a very large format<br />for our plate work to be projected later.
5924836 5930081 After having done that we, you know,<br />struck prints and timed out the plates
5930174 5932882 to the level we wanted,
5932969 5937304 and then went to do<br />the process stuff on stage,
5937390 5940508 which was the driving footage<br />of them in the car,
5940893 5944682 tied in to drive-by shots<br />that we had done out in the locations,
5944772 5947389 and the near misses and whatnot.
5947608 5950726 I'm pretty happy the way<br />that the process stuff turned out.
5950820 5956031 We had some interactive lights going on.<br />We had rain that helped...
5956784 5961699 diffuse the translight imageries,<br />I mean the rear scrim imagery,
5961789 5968206 so it all blended in a lot better, and segued<br />into the actual impact of the car itself,
5968296 5971414 which we ended up doing,<br />I think, three different nights.
5971507 5976126 We shot originally at the beginning<br />of the picture in that first week
5976888 5979926 out in the location. Where was that?
5980016 5982553 (Alex) Sunland. Sun Valley.
5983060 5985597 (Jeff) And did two cars that night,<br />you know,
5985688 5988180 which is always four<br />because of the impact.
5988274 5991141 Then a week or two later<br />we were in Long Beach
5991235 5994523 and shot tight stuff of impacts<br />of the cars' bumpers
5994614 5996571 and overhead shots of the impact,
5996908 6003325 and then the last week went out and shot<br />additional footage of the cars going off
6003581 6007415 to get an array of tumbling shots<br />and a different landing for the vehicle.
6007502 6012588 'Cause David was never really satisfied<br />with the way it landed in the first two.
6012757 6017923 And then Alex had built<br />the side of the wash set on stage,
6018137 6023428 where Cliff, our effects man,<br />had actually rigged it
6023518 6025850 so it would slide the last 2ft or so.
6025937 6031933 (Alex) The last few feet<br />and the landing was on stage.
6032151 6037567 (Jeff) The car landed, and Brad and Edward<br />and the space monkeys climbed out,
6037990 6043952 then we made a half-car that<br />we shot their... the coverage of them -
6044038 6047872 the dialog right before the impact,<br />and some driving footage.
6047959 6050997 And then we did, I guess,<br />like a washing-machine car,
6051087 6055046 where we had cut the back and the front<br />off the car and put it on a spindle,
6055132 6059296 so that we could rotate it, then mounted<br />a camera to the vehicle itself,
6059387 6062550 and then rotated them and the camera.
6062640 6066725 And that's how you get the great tumbling<br />as they're crashing down the side.
6067144 6069636 So there was a lot of layers to it.
6216794 6223006 (Alex) We spent a lot of time looking for a<br />soap... somebody who could make it for us
6223092 6226801 and also teach Brad and Edward<br />the process of soap making.
6226971 6231386 And we found this lady<br />who sold soap in the farmers' market
6231475 6234843 who came in<br />and gave a little teaching course
6234937 6239932 of how to turn the liposuction into...<br />how to render fat.
6240526 6245646 And the color of the soap was supposed<br />to reflect the color of the liposuction.
6267011 6269753 (Michael) Throughout the movie,
6269930 6272672 Helena wears this makeup<br />that Julie Pearce,
6272767 6274178 the makeup artist on the film, found,
6274268 6280105 and it gives her skin<br />this incredible opalescent quality,
6280399 6285109 which... I don't know,<br />it almost seems like...
6285196 6286937 It's beautiful, but it almost seems like
6287031 6290114 she's in a cold sweat or something<br />the whole time.
6290201 6296197 It's almost like a drugged-like state.
6297833 6302202 She appears very Dresden<br />and vampire-like.
6341919 6345207 (Alex) The rolling ball<br />was a hell of a night shoot.
6345297 6347083 (laughter)
6347883 6351217 (Michael) People thought<br />that looked like the Geffen logo.
6351303 6353840 (Alex) I know. I'm surprised<br />we got away with it.
6353931 6355387 (laughs)
6358435 6361848 This was a fiberglass ball<br />that basically floated,
6361939 6368276 and had to appear to be<br />a 300-ton ball of brass.
6369321 6374907 (Jeff) We had tag lines of guys<br />guiding it down the fall.
6374994 6377827 (Alex) Right. Who had to be taken out.
6377997 6381706 And basically, it did hit the water<br />and float, so it was kind of a problem.
6381792 6384204 (Jeff) A challenging dilemma.
6384295 6385626 (laughter)
6387172 6390881 (Alex) And then we built a Starbucks-like
6390968 6395178 coffee bar for it to smash into.
6395598 6398215 (Jeff) There were several balls.<br />Two at least.
6398309 6399674 (Alex) Three.
6400644 6401600 They were fairly delicate.
6401687 6405430 When they went into the glass,<br />they got pretty scratched up.
6443354 6448064 (Jeff) I do think that you'd be a fool<br />not to acknowledge the technology
6448150 6451734 and know that ultimately<br />it's gonna be digital.
6452029 6455272 From one point of view, it's fantastic that
6455366 6457403 you could walk into<br />any theater in the country
6457493 6460576 and have a digital image<br />that's identical to the other.
6460913 6465248 For a cameraman, that's<br />one of the tragic things that happens.
6465334 6469168 You go from three theaters<br />on the same block, watching your movie,
6469254 6472588 and it will look three different ways.
6473008 6476717 Digitally, there's so much more control.
6476845 6477835 You'll be able to time<br />your picture digitally,
6479765 6482257 and they won't have to make<br />a thousand prints,
6482351 6485764 farm it out to some lab in Canada<br />or somewhere else
6485854 6489142 where it's gonna be inconsistent<br />and every roll changes colors,
6489233 6492897 and you won't have to have somebody<br />making roll changes at the wrong times.
6493404 6495941 I think it's fantastic. But at the same time,
6496031 6500992 I haven't yet seen digital<br />that gives you the same feeling of film.
6501078 6506118 But I know that it ultimately is coming.<br />And so I would embrace it and go with it.
6506208 6508666 I think it's wonderful.
6509044 6512787 (Alex) It may never be the same as film,<br />but it's gonna be.
6513465 6515957 So, as you say,<br />I think you have to embrace it.
6516051 6519760 (Jeff) But along with it, you need to learn<br />there's certain advantages to it.
6519847 6523340 You need to learn the technology,<br />and then you just run with that.
6523434 6527098 There's so many things that you can do<br />with it that you can't do with film.
6527396 6531230 As it is now, when you do<br />a commercial or a music video,
6531316 6534809 you don't make prints,<br />it's all transferred right off the negative.
6534903 6538271 So there's conscious choices<br />you make while you're shooting,
6538365 6542074 to leave things in shots,<br />to light with this color light,
6542161 6544744 knowing you'll do it differently<br />when you do the transfer.
6544830 6549620 So certainly, in a lot of aspects,<br />it's gonna make life easier.
6550294 6553457 I'm hoping to do enough pictures<br />and make enough money
6553547 6556710 so that when it replaces me,<br />I'll be all right.
6556800 6558165 (laughter)
6558260 6562379 When it's all done at a switch<br />and we don't need anybody up there.
6562639 6565552 I mean, as it gets more and more digital
6565642 6567633 there'll be more and more<br />motorized cameras.
6567728 6570220 I know that David<br />would love nothing more
6570314 6573557 than every shot to be motion-control, so...
6574151 6576062 (Alex) He'll need<br />somebody to program it.
6576153 6578394 (Jeff) I'll be a programer.
6579948 6582690 (Michael) When Fight Club<br />was at the film festival in Venice,
6583160 6586653 Fincher thought it would<br />make better use of his time
6586747 6590411 to go out every day with a digital camera<br />and just shoot Venice,
6590501 6593619 so that long after it sinks,<br />he could do a movie set there.
6593796 6595662 (laughter)
6654356 6658350 (Alex) One thing I love about shooting in LA<br />is you can still find locations
6658443 6663654 that people have never used before that<br />still look like anywhere else in the States.
6663740 6666107 I think David did<br />an incredible job with Se7en
6666201 6670616 just making it look like<br />anywhere, not like LA.
6670706 6672947 And I think it works again here.
6675335 6679454 (Jeff) There's very few clues<br />that would tell you where you are.
6709161 6714952 (Michael) What Helena is wearing here<br />is actually a girdle,
6715542 6718250 and the straps are garter belts.
6718337 6723423 You can see the little hook<br />that fastens onto the stockings.
6723634 6727628 I just inverted it<br />and had her kind of squeeze into it.
6727971 6732306 It just seemed like<br />something Marla would do.
6745906 6747772 This was something really off the wall,
6747866 6753407 Tyler wearing<br />a politically correct faux fur coat.
6753664 6755246 (laughter)
6756708 6761077 (Jeff) He definitely wears it<br />like nobody else could.
6766343 6769085 (Alex) We used the same set<br />for both hotel rooms.
6769179 6773548 It was kind of almost to make the point.
6773976 6778265 And we used the same<br />fabrics and wallpaper
6778355 6781848 in the airplanes as we did in the offices,
6782234 6784771 and in his apartment.
6784861 6788195 We tried as much as possible<br />to use the same textures
6788282 6789272 through all the corporate world,
6789366 6792950 so there was no difference if you were<br />sitting in an airplane or at home,
6793036 6795027 or sitting in the hotel.
6795580 6797696 It was all one big McDonald's world.
6845172 6850508 (Jeff) There are so many short sequences<br />that take place to tell this story.
6850927 6852668 It was a little bit of a precarious shot.
6852763 6855846 We had to get a crane<br />to the top of this building,
6856099 6860559 and rebuild the crane<br />in order to get it up there.
6860645 6863979 It was a building where<br />only one elevator was working, so it was...
6864483 6868898 (Alex) And there was no parapet<br />on the building, so it was...
6869154 6873398 It felt incredibly dangerous to scout it<br />and to have a whole crew up there.
6873492 6875529 Especially at night.
6875619 6878702 (Jeff) I had the fellas rappel,<br />and with the up
6878789 6881497 angle it was Edward looking over the side,
6881583 6885121 so he had to be all tethered off,<br />safety and so on.
6885212 6889171 You did have a feeling of nakedness,<br />'cause there was no parapet, no walls,
6889257 6893125 no kind of railings to hold on,<br />and the wind would pick up,
6893220 6898932 and you kind of felt yourself<br />gravitating towards the edges.
6899226 6904187 I have one comment. I'll set<br />the record straight for one thing here.
6904272 6907264 The sequence where Edward actually
6907359 6909817 comes to terms with Brad<br />in his hotel room,
6909986 6914696 in the traditional sense of photography,<br />and for those that are supercritical,
6914783 6919243 it's always a sin to have a double shadow,<br />to have two shadows of somebody.
6919329 6923118 And the scene always bothered me<br />because it does have two shadows.
6923208 6926576 But they're justified shadows.<br />So I'm setting the record straight.
6926837 6929955 He's next to a practical light source<br />casting one shadow,
6930048 6933507 and he has a window<br />that's casting the other.
6933635 6937754 It's justified that there's two shadows,<br />but it's bothered me from day one, so...
6937848 6940055 (Michael) Jeff, you fucked up.<br />Just face it like a man!
6940142 6942053 (laughter)
6942269 6944351 All right, well...
6944438 6947100 No, it's justified. It makes sense.
6957451 6960569 (Alex) This was the very first sequence<br />to sell the idea
6960662 6965031 that the space monkeys<br />had been making bombs in the basement,
6965125 6967662 and we did a lot of research.
6968628 6972292 We're probably all marked men on<br />the internet, the amount of anarchist sites
6972382 6976171 that we visited to get the background<br />on how to make bombs
6976261 6979595 and what the real equipment would be.
6990108 6991314 (Jeff) With all of David's movies,
6991401 6995440 there's so much information<br />loaded into each sequence
6995530 7000946 that, you know, even having been<br />part of every shot of the movie,
7001036 7005496 you go back, and when you watch it<br />a second, third time, you see things,
7005582 7009576 you appreciate things differently<br />or see things that you didn't realize
7009836 7012919 how they would come across onscreen.
7014633 7017796 (Alex) This is the first time I've seen a film
7017886 7021004 in the rough cut and<br />felt like I had no part in it.
7021097 7026467 There were so many surprises,<br />so much that I hadn't seen in the process.
7026853 7028890 (Jeff) I agree.
7029231 7031393 (Alex) It's kind of great.
7033693 7038779 Almost all the time<br />when you work on a film,
7038865 7041357 you're so taken back to<br />what the situation was
7041451 7044284 while you worked on it, you can't watch it.
7045747 7049786 With Fight Club,<br />I think I never had that problem.
7073316 7078061 (Michael) It's funny how everybody talked<br />so much about the violence in this movie,
7078154 7080942 and nobody talked about how funny it is.
7081032 7083364 This is one of<br />the funniest movies I've ever seen.
7083660 7085992 (Alex) It's hilarious, yeah.
7087205 7091494 (Jeff) There is an element of violence<br />to the movie, but its title says Fight Club.
7091585 7093167 What did you expect? A picnic?
7093253 7099169 It's like you go into it knowing that there<br />is gonna be an element of violence to it.
7099259 7102251 But it's no more violent<br />than 90% of the movies that you see,
7102345 7107431 and there's only one killing in the whole<br />movie, and it's done by a police officer.
7107851 7109933 I have a 21/2-year-old at home,
7110020 7113433 and I watched Antz for the first time<br />about three weeks ago.
7113523 7117266 There's a sequence<br />where they're decimating these termites,
7117360 7121775 and the termites are whacking ants in half<br />and limbs are flying across the screen,
7121865 7123447 ants are being decapitated.
7123533 7126992 And I don't recall anybody<br />talking about the violence of Antz.
7127370 7129702 So it's odd to me.
7132000 7135118 This movie's certainly funnier<br />than when I read the script,
7135211 7136793 what I thought it would be.
7137088 7140251 (Alex) Yeah.<br />(Michael) It's a lot funnier than Antz.
7140383 7141464 (laughter)
7141551 7144213 (Jeff) It's funnier than Antz.
7186346 7193218 (Alex) These simple shots in the location<br />street are always very elaborate to set up.
7193561 7195643 Signage becomes<br />more and more of an issue
7195730 7197516 these days with what<br />you can and can't show,
7197607 7203353 and we spent two or three days here<br />replacing signage, putting...
7203780 7209275 Each of the film marquees<br />has a film that is...
7210036 7215702 The lead actor in each of the films<br />is either Helena, Brad or Edward.
7216418 7221754 I think that's... Seven Years In Tibet<br />is there. And back there is...
7221840 7224127 (Jeff) Larry Flynt?<br />(Alex) Exactly.
7224217 7227300 (Michael) And across the street is Wings.
7227387 7233383 Three marquees that could be seen from<br />the front stairs of the apartment building.
7233476 7236434 -Or is that the... cafeteria?<br />-(Alex) It's the cafeteria.
7249159 7253744 I've always felt that<br />this film's like a mirror.
7253830 7257824 I mean, the idea that it seems to be
7257917 7261251 the perfect end-of—the—'903 film
7261337 7265752 in the way it reflects society, and I think<br />that's really what David captured so well,
7265842 7269801 and what the book originally<br />captured so well, just the sense of...
7270096 7275717 sort of ennui and frustration,
7275935 7278802 when you're on this road where,<br />you know,
7278897 7281355 there's nothing really wrong with buying...
7281441 7283853 everyone buys identical clothes<br />from The Gap.
7283943 7285854 There's nothing really wrong<br />with Starbucks coffee,
7285945 7289688 but it's just like we're on this roll,
7290200 7292362 sort of unstoppable.
7303129 7308795 I just want to say, that interrogation room<br />is my favorite set in the movie.
7308885 7314506 It's the perfect expression<br />of what the Jack world is.
7315225 7318843 It's kind of a combination<br />of textures and reflection
7318937 7325024 and bad wood paneling,<br />this kind of rush matting wallpaper.
7325485 7328352 And we set it up not as an interrogation...
7328446 7332189 It was like they used one of<br />the teaching rooms in the police station
7332283 7335696 as an interrogation room,<br />so it's got blackboards and TVs,
7335787 7341328 and it's there<br />to teach the police how to do their job.
7450985 7456025 (Jeff) We did a ramping as Edward's<br />running from his interrogation.
7458076 7461785 We had a sequence where he comes down<br />an alleyway between buildings,
7461871 7465830 which we actually shot<br />on the backlot at Fox,
7466000 7471666 and we did a speed change,<br />a ramp change, from 24 to 120 frames,
7471756 7477627 which is another reason why it would've<br />been difficult, a lot more complex shot.
7477720 7481429 In anamorphics, we simply<br />wouldn't have had this exposure to do that
7481516 7483928 with the available lights<br />and without lighting
7484018 7486555 the buildings in the background deeply.
7486646 7491391 But an interesting dilemma happened<br />which we were aware of.
7491567 7493183 Whenever you're doing a ramp,
7493277 7497066 you're out of sync with<br />any kind of crystal light sources,
7497156 7502697 meaning any kind of HMI or mercury<br />vapor or sodium vapor lights,
7502787 7506906 which all those buildings have, that are<br />all placed on the buildings naturally.
7507000 7509037 So in the speed change,
7509127 7512119 we actually got a rather aggravating pulse
7512213 7514705 coming off the parking structure<br />to the left.
7514799 7520010 And you'd have to ask Kevin<br />exactly how they technically removed it,
7520096 7523179 but they isolated the flicker<br />and removed it
7523266 7527055 with some kind of noise control<br />or something, and you don't see it.
7527437 7529519 Another example of the digital world
7529605 7533439 crossing over into ours,<br />and actually saving us.
7535903 7541899 (Michael) I love what Tyler's wearing here.<br />He's wearing once again the faux fur coat.
7542201 7547196 He's wearing a tank top with porno stars,
7547290 7549657 female porno stars, all over it.
7549751 7552493 I saw the fabric in a shop, and I ordered it,
7552587 7555454 and we made the tank tops.<br />Postal worker pants,
7557133 7559545 and some patent leather Gucci shoes
7559635 7563219 that I found in a junk store<br />in Palm Springs.
7616067 7621858 A lot of the advertising, though,<br />a lot of things are obliterated.
7622406 7624147 (Alex) I don't think<br />anyone realizes how hard it is
7624242 7627360 to make a film that has a script like this
7627453 7631287 that nobody will allow you<br />to show their product on.
7631582 7635246 And you have to remove advertising<br />everywhere you go.
7635336 7638203 (Jeff) I'm surprised<br />we got away with what we did.
7638381 7642340 (Michael) I was amazed that Starbucks<br />let us use their product,
7642426 7649173 although when we were having the ball<br />go through the coffee-shop window,
7649267 7650928 we couldn't use it there.
7651018 7654181 (Alex) You're allowed to use it<br />for somebody drinking coffee.
7654272 7658641 But I think they were<br />actually thinking about letting us do it,
7658734 7661317 but somebody had been shot<br />in a Starbucks last year
7661404 7664396 and they thought<br />the connotation was too close.
7760628 7765418 We built a fake set of stair treads<br />for that shot,
7765508 7767840 rubber treads all the way down.
7768761 7774598 (Jeff) It was the night before Thanksgiving<br />and... I can't remember exactly,
7774684 7777893 but it was between seven<br />and 11 times that he got tossed,
7779563 7784933 and I believe the last time Brad<br />tossed him, Brad, not being a stunt man,
7785027 7788520 didn't know how much energy to exert<br />and actually threw him
7788614 7790104 a good part of the way down the stairs.
7790199 7793066 And each time the guy did it,<br />you could see
7793160 7795948 the welts swelling on his legs and arms.
7796038 7799076 Stunt men are so macho,<br />they'll never tell you that they're hurt.
7799166 7803205 But he probably<br />spent Thanksgiving in traction.
7808384 7812969 (Alex) This set's built on a 10ft platform,
7813472 7819764 so you could get close to the windows and<br />still have the translight going out of frame.
7820021 7824561 It's a combination of buildings<br />from downtown LA and Century City,
7824900 7827312 put together in a different relationship.
7827403 7831738 But you actually have the Century City<br />Twin Towers and the Fox building in there.
7832158 7837278 (Jeff) This is a sequence where we used<br />more light than I've ever used in my life,
7837371 7840864 lighting this translight. We had 148<br />of these Skypans I told you about
7840958 7844997 with different globes for<br />the two partitions of the translight,
7845087 7846998 some 2K and some 5K globes,
7847089 7851458 and 18 wall lights across the ceiling
7851552 7854920 to give us a slightly cool,<br />moonlit ambience
7855014 7859258 to help separate Edward<br />from the background.
7859477 7863766 We had about eight wall lights<br />on the ground
7863856 7867520 with a slightly CTO correction on
7867610 7871103 to give you the sodium vapor light<br />you had in the streets,
7871280 7874818 that warmish orange light<br />that you saw earlier.
7875117 7879827 And then the rest of it was just these, like,<br />the Home Depot version of work lights
7879914 7882201 that we placed around the set.
7882291 7887161 And then part of our strategy to balancing<br />out the color differences of the translight
7887254 7889370 was to put a mild correction<br />into the camera.
7889465 7894460 And in doing so, I then had to gel all of<br />the little Home Depot lights to match,
7894553 7897841 and then gel the wall lights<br />that were the moonlight to match.
7897932 7903803 Everything offset something else, and it<br />was this wacky formula that we survived.
7908150 7914317 (Alex) The translight for the beginning<br />and end sequence in the office buildings
7914448 7915904 was a very elaborate process.
7915991 7922533 We had to photograph<br />and make a matte painting
7922623 7924785 and make a translight,
7924875 7929836 probably six months before<br />the final visual effects shot was finished,
7929922 7932960 where the buildings fall.
7934343 7936880 And all our buildings<br />had to line up exactly with the three-D,
7936971 7941636 so David had the three-D artist work
7941725 7944433 in collaboration with a stills photographer,
7945229 7949473 and build the view of the city<br />as it was going to be in three-D,
7949567 7955279 and then did some really fast pre-vis tests<br />of how the city would fall,
7955364 7959403 so you were clear which buildings would<br />be revealed by the buildings that fell down.
7959618 7964112 And once that was locked, we also did a<br />test of the camera moves within that set,
7964206 7967995 so we knew exactly which part of the<br />translight we'd see and were able to test
7968252 7972712 whether it would stand up realistically<br />and what the lighting was gonna be,
7973174 7975040 what the frame was gonna be<br />at the widest,
7975134 7978172 then went forward<br />with building a translight.
7978512 7983757 -Then literally had to cut with the three-D.<br />-(Jeff) So you had to commit fairly early
7983851 7987936 to the amount of time it took to build<br />the translight and allow us to test it.
7988022 7993643 And then Doc started very soon after that<br />to start composing the CG work.
7993736 7996819 (Alex) Side by side.<br />(Jeff) It was quite a long process.
7997114 8001358 (Alex) But that was fairly unique, 'cause<br />the translight was almost completed.
8001452 8003784 It was a digital image,<br />which is tough anyway,
8003871 8005407 because you have problems with matte.
8005498 8010288 There were ten different composite<br />buildings, I think, in that shot,
8010878 8013666 so that the lighting<br />had to match on all of them.
8013756 8016919 And there was elaborate work<br />in the matte painting.
8017009 8023927 It was two translights, actually, but<br />totally a 40ft by 120ft backlit photograph.
8024308 8028973 And we placed one of the translights<br />a few feet in front of the other
8029063 8034308 so there was a parallax shift as the camera<br />moved in the environment also.
8034610 8037944 (Jeff) Create an element of depth,<br />and three-D imagery to it.
8038030 8042365 (Alex) With a translight, you never<br />have nothing between the camera and it.
8042451 8045068 Of course, we had just glass windows,
8045162 8048700 no way of really hiding<br />the usual problems with translights.
8048791 8052375 So we did what we could<br />to try and give that layer of reality.
8052461 8055749 (Jeff) We had a bobbinet manufactured
8056006 8060125 that covered in between<br />the windows and the translight
8060219 8066636 to add an element of diffusion and to kind<br />of soften the hard edges of the translight.
8066809 8069892 Because the translight<br />was two pieces and was so long,
8069979 8076942 and we only could find a German company<br />that could manufacture one that large,
8077027 8080110 120ft by 40ft without seams.
8080614 8085609 So it was a little bit of an elaborate setup.
8086662 8091782 It took such a long time<br />to manufacture this translight,
8091875 8096585 and the way the schedule worked out,<br />it was only fully installed and lit
8096672 8100666 two days before we were actually<br />gonna shoot our first sequence in there.
8100759 8107131 And so we had our gaffer go down<br />and shoot a test shot of the translight
8107224 8110592 whilst we were still shooting<br />other sequences.
8110686 8116102 All along the process we had gotten strips<br />of various pieces of the building.
8116191 8119149 What were they?<br />Six-inch by four-foot strips
8119236 8123776 that we constantly lit and checked color<br />and shot tests of segments of it,
8123866 8126449 as it changed colors<br />and changed densities,
8126535 8130073 in order to get the look that we wanted.
8131040 8134374 Once it arrived,<br />the day before we were gonna shoot
8134460 8137953 we got to see our test projected back,
8138047 8143213 and the two pieces that gave us<br />the dimension
8143302 8146715 were vastly different in density and color<br />between each other.
8147014 8149722 And now we have one night, basically,
8149808 8153551 to remedy a dilemma<br />that's 120ft across and 40ft high.
8155397 8157229 It was an interesting approach.
8157316 8160934 And we more or less had to do<br />some simple calculations
8161028 8163986 and hope that those worked out on paper,
8164073 8166610 'cause we wouldn't have<br />another chance to test it
8166700 8168941 before the day's shooting happened,
8169036 8171323 and so overnight we had<br />a rigging crew come in.
8171413 8177910 They changed out, I think, some 80<br />Skypan lights to different globe densities
8178003 8181667 to bring up the exposure on one side<br />and knock it down on the other,
8181757 8187298 and then we added correction gels<br />to one complete translight.
8187763 8189754 Which is an enormous translight to do,
8189848 8193557 and fortunately, the next day,<br />it all worked out well.
8193644 8199481 -But... tense moments for a while there.<br />-(Alex) It's one of the interesting...
8199566 8204686 It sort of represents... The cuts<br />between digital and film actually translate,
8204780 8209149 because right now they're at the point<br />where your original material
8209243 8211280 is generally being created digitally.
8211453 8214662 But as much as<br />you can color-control the digital image,
8214957 8219576 it doesn't translate into film,<br />though that wasn't exactly the issue.
8219795 8222412 Trying to get accurate color<br />between digital
8222506 8225624 and film in that kind of physical sense
8225718 8227709 is really quite hard.
8239648 8242060 I think it's great to be able<br />to work on a film
8242151 8248147 that has a sense of really reflecting<br />its historical moment.
8248532 8252992 And ultimately what has been most<br />satisfying to me about working on this film
8253078 8259996 was just being able to immerse yourself<br />in something that seems kind of accurate.
8260335 8266377 And I think probably it won't be perceived<br />as such immediately by a lot of people.
8266467 8271883 But in reflection, I think that we were able<br />to really capture a moment in time.
8271972 8274213 Those have always been<br />my favorite films to watch,
8274308 8278677 so it's very satisfying to have a chance<br />to work on something like this.
8278896 8285017 (Jeff) If rap represents<br />a certain time capsule of the '90s,
8285110 8289354 then this movie visually<br />certainly captures it.
8290532 8297279 (Michael) I just love the idea of having<br />worked on a film that I wanna go see.
8297706 8299288 It's kind of rare.
8299416 8302829 (Alex) And a film that almost<br />all the work you do makes it onto screen,
8302920 8304957 which is also kind of rare.
8305214 8310209 I don't think there was a set that we built<br />that didn't make it on film.
8310594 8315430 (Jeff) Plus it's nice to know that<br />the effort that it takes to make a picture,
8315766 8320681 that someone... that the director<br />has the same integrity and keeps it there,
8320771 8323889 and it all shows onscreen.
8323982 8326644 It's such a pleasure<br />to work with somebody
8326735 8330148 that has that much knowledge<br />and applies it,
8330656 8335116 and uses you to the best of your capacity,
8335202 8337864 which I think he certainly did<br />with all of us.
8337955 8343576 (Alex) Yeah, Fincher pushes everybody<br />to make their best work. It's great.
8343752 8344992 (Jeff) But in the end, it shows.
