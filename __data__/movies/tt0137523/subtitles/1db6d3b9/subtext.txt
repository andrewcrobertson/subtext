125171 128149 <i>People are always asking me<br />if I know Tyler Durden.</i>
128466 130033 Three minutes.
130051 132611 This is it. Ground zero.
133137 135281 Want to say a few words for the occasion?
136641 139834 <i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,<br />you speak only in vowels.</i>
139852 141586 I can't think of anything.
141604 145840 <i>For a second, I forget about<br />Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>
145858 148051 <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>
148069 150094 It's getting exciting now.
150112 153306 <i>That old saying,<br />how you always hurt the one you love,</i>
153324 155426 <i>well, it works both ways.</i>
156035 159979 <i>We have front-row seats<br />for this theater of mass destruction.</i>
159997 162315 <i>The Demolitions Committee<br />of Project Mayhem</i>
162333 166986 <i>wrapped the foundation columns<br />of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>
167004 169697 <i>In two minutes,<br />primary charges will blow base charges</i>
169715 173277 <i>and a few blocks will be reduced<br />to smoldering rubble.</i>
173678 176405 <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>
176806 180375 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
180393 186005 <i>Suddenly I realize that all of this -<br />the gun, the bombs, the revolution</i>
186023 189585 <i>has got something to do<br />with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>
191320 193798 <i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>
194824 198518 <i>This was a support group<br />for men with testicular cancer.</i>
198536 201972 <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,<br />that was Bob.</i>
202331 204016 We're still men.
204375 206018 Yes, we're men.
206419 208278 Men is what we are.
208296 212400 <i>Bob had had his testicles removed.<br />Then hormone therapy.</i>
213092 216035 <i>He developed bitch tits<br />'cause his testosterone was too high</i>
216053 218204 <i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>
218222 222583 - That was where I fit.<br />- They'll have to drain my pecs again.
222601 224544 <i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>
224562 228047 <i>that hung enormous,<br />the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>
228065 230334 Okay, you cry now.
231569 234422 <i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>
235114 237675 <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>
237700 239969 <i>I couldn't sleep...</i>
240494 242847 <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>
243706 245683 <i>Everything's far away.</i>
245750 248067 <i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>
248085 249603 <i>of a copy.</i>
253007 255074 <i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>
255092 258195 <i>it'll be the corporations<br />that name everything.</i>
258304 260322 <i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>
260765 262700 <i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>
263059 265077 <i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>
265478 268421 I need you out of town this week<br />to cover some red flags.
268439 272091 <i>It must have been Tuesday.<br />He had on his cornflower-blue tie.</i>
272109 276804 You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
276822 281434 Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.<br />Call me if there's any snags.
281452 285306 <i>He was full of pep.<br />Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>
287541 292438 <i>Like so many others, I had become<br />a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>
292963 297283 - I'd like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.<br /><i>- Please hold.</i>
297301 300119 <i>If I saw something clever,<br />like a coffee table</i>
300137 303240 <i>in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.</i>
304266 306667 <i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>
306685 309337 <i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>
309355 313167 <i>Or the Ohamshab sofa<br />with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>
313484 318088 <i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of<br />environmentally friendly unbleached paper.</i>
318489 320473 <i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:</i>
320491 323802 <i>What kind of dining set<br />defines me as a person?</i>
324662 329440 <i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes<br />with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>
329458 331651 <i>proof that they were<br />crafted by the honest,</i>
331669 334320 <i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>
334338 335814 <i>- Please hold.<br />- ...wherever.</i>
338426 340368 <i>We used to read pornography.</i>
340386 342370 <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>
342388 346784 - No. You can't die of insomnia.<br />- What about narcolepsy?
347226 351421 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.<br />I have no idea how I got there.
351439 355508 - You need to lighten up.<br />- Can you please just give me something?
355526 358671 <i>Red and blue Tuinals,<br />lipstick-red Seconals...</i>
359155 362550 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
363200 366595 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
369665 373734 - Hey, come on. I'm in pain.<br />- You wanna see pain?
373752 378649 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.<br />See the guys with testicular cancer.
379216 380859 That's pain.
396400 400254 I always wanted three kids.<br />Two boys and a girl.
401030 403591 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
404074 406594 We never could agree on anything.
407828 411181 Well, she had her first child last week.
412041 413350 A girl.
414835 417354 With her... with her new husband.
421550 423611 And thank God. You know?
424178 426030 I-I'm glad for her.
427389 430826 Because she deserves it.
434188 437673 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
437691 439460 Thank you, Thomas.
439860 443255 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
443447 445556 And that gives me strength.
445574 447801 We give each other strength.
447993 449602 It's time for the one-on-ones.
449620 454391 So let's all of us follow Thomas's example<br />and really open ourselves up.
455125 457269 Could you find a partner?
459755 462441 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>
463801 466695 <i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>
469223 472493 <i>Knees together.<br />Those awkward little steps.</i>
478065 480125 - My name is Bob.<br />- Bob?
480901 483344 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>
483362 486806 <i>You know that chest expansion<br />program on late-night TV?</i>
486824 488266 <i>That was his idea.</i>
488284 489927 I was a juicer.
490619 492805 You know - using steroids.
494164 497810 Diabonal and... Wisterol.
498210 501855 Oh, they use that on racehorses,<br />for Christ's sakes.
502798 506610 And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
508596 513534 my two grown kids<br />won't even return my phone calls.
514852 519039 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty<br />make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>
521734 523711 Go ahead... Cornelius.
524653 526213 You can cry.
541045 544864 <i>And then... something happened.<br />I let go.</i>
544882 546734 That's really good.
546967 548777 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>
549136 551488 <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>
553807 555492 <i>I found freedom.</i>
556101 558495 <i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>
560439 561874 It's okay.
565152 567463 <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>
570574 573177 <i>I became addicted.</i>
586840 591528 <i>If I didn't say anything,<br />people always assumed the worst.</i>
595432 597792 <i>They cried harder...</i>
597810 599161 <i>then I cried harder.</i>
607778 612090 Now we're going to open the green door,<br />the heart chakra...
612241 614301 <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>
614576 617554 <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>
618080 621892 <i>I was the warm little center<br />that the life of this world crowded around.</i>
622626 626730 Imagine your pain<br />as a white ball of healing light.
627297 630734 It moves over your body, healing you.
631427 634321 Now keep this going.<br />Remember to breathe.
634513 637908 And step forward<br />through the back door of the room.
638809 640619 Where does it lead?
640978 642704 To your cave.
643272 646625 Step forward into your cave.
647484 649044 That's right.
649319 652714 <i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>
653157 658095 <i>and you're going to find<br />your power animal.</i>
660205 661682 Slide.
672426 674486 <i>Every evening I died.</i>
675554 678282 <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>
678849 680325 <i>Resurrected.</i>
682936 687173 <i>Bob loved me because he thought<br />my testicles were removed too.</i>
687191 691753 <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,<br />ready to cry.</i>
692237 694298 <i>This was my vacation.</i>
698035 701771 <i>And she... ruined everything.</i>
701789 703765 This is cancer, right?
706877 711315 <i>This chick, Maria Singer,<br />did not have testicular cancer.</i>
711799 713442 <i>She was a liar.</i>
713550 715986 <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>
716136 720080 <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,<br />my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>
720098 723327 <i>Then at Hope,<br />my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>
724186 728040 <i>And again at Seize The Day,<br />my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>
731235 734171 <i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>
734738 737174 <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>
737241 739892 <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>
739910 744640 <i>I couldn't cry.<br />So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>
756927 759529 <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>
759763 762957 <i>after we open our heart chakras,<br />when it's time to hug,</i>
762975 765918 <i>I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer<br />and scream:</i>
765936 770248 Marla, you liar!<br />You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!
771692 773919 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>
774778 775970 <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>
775988 779299 <i>When you have insomnia,<br />you're never really asleep</i>
779825 782177 <i>and you're never really awake.</i>
784371 788558 To begin tonight's communion,<br />Chloe would like to say a few words.
789585 791979 <i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>
793088 795447 <i>Chloe looked the way<br />Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>
795465 799569 <i>if you made it walk around a party<br />being extra nice to everybody.</i>
800137 802030 Well, I'm still here.
802598 804908 But I don't know for how long.
805642 808787 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
809354 811581 But I've got some good news.
812065 814668 I no longer have any fear of death.
818405 822300 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
823285 825595 No one will have sex with me.
826705 827813 I'm so close to the end,
827831 831101 and all I want is to get laid for<br />the last time.
831835 834612 I have pornographic movies<br />in my apartment,
834630 838108 - and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />- Thank you, Chloe.
839092 841319 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
842679 844573 Thank you, Chloe.
846391 850203 Now, let's ready ourself<br />for guided meditation.
852356 855500 You're standing at the entrance<br />of your cave.
855901 859212 You step inside your cave and you walk...
859363 862758 <i>if I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>
863867 865135 <i>Marla.</i>
865243 867311 <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>
867329 870856 <i>that would heal if you could stop<br />tonguing it, but you can't.</i>
870874 874352 ...deeper into your cave as you walk.
875712 879149 <i>You feel<br />a healing energy all around you.</i>
881134 883320 <i>Now find your power animal.</i>
887683 889034 Slide.
892813 895415 Okay. Let's partner up.
895899 898543 Pick someone special to you tonight.
904574 905759 Hey.
906994 909012 - We need to talk.<br />- Sure.
914292 916068 - I'm onto you.<br />- What?
916086 919189 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
919965 921073 Sorry?
921091 925744 In the Tibetan-philosophy,<br />Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
925762 929366 But you're not dying<br />the way Chloe back there is dying.
929599 930700 So?
931351 933203 So you're a tourist.
933562 937923 I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,<br />I saw you at tuberculosis.
937941 940050 I saw you at testicular cancer!
940068 942212 I saw you practicing this.
942279 944471 - Practicing what?<br />- Telling me off.
944489 947592 Is it going as well as you hoped...<br />"Rupert"?
948952 951854 - I'll expose you.<br />- Go ahead. I'll expose you.
951872 954891 Come together. Let yourselves cry.
962966 964783 Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
964801 967286 It's cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.
967304 971081 Look, this is important.<br />These are my groups.
971099 973292 I've been coming for over a year.
973310 976378 - Why do you do it?<br />- I don't know.
976396 980299 When people think you're dying,<br />they really listen to you instead of...
980317 983336 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
984488 986882 Yeah. Yeah.
987783 990468 Share yourself, completely.
991745 994480 You don't want to get into this.<br />It becomes an addiction.
994498 996815 - Really?<br />- I'm not kidding.
996833 1000319 I can't cry if another faker is present,<br />and I need this.
1000337 1002988 So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
1003006 1006193 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1009096 1011448 Wait a second. Hold on.
1012057 1015918 We'll split up the week, okay?<br />You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1015936 1018670 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1018688 1022174 Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1022192 1026303 Technically, I have more right to be there.<br />You still have your balls.
1026321 1028798 - You're kidding.<br />- I dunno. Am I?
1029032 1030342 No. No.
1030367 1033352 - What do you want?<br />- I'll take the parasites.
1033370 1036188 You can't have both.<br />Take the blood parasites.
1036206 1037856 I want brain parasites.
1037874 1040859 I'll take the blood,<br />but I want brain dementia.
1040877 1043529 - I want that.<br />- You can't have the whole brain.
1043547 1046198 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1046216 1049819 Okay. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
1050303 1052447 Now we both have three...
1056017 1058662 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1074661 1078730 - What, are you selling those?<br />- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
1078748 1080899 So, we each have three. That's six.
1080917 1083402 What about the seventh day?<br />I want bowel cancer.
1083420 1085571 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>
1085589 1090568 - No. No. I want bowel cancer.<br />- That's your favorite too?
1090969 1094698 - Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />- Look, we'll split it.
1094973 1098076 Take the first and third Sunday<br />of the month.
1100228 1101413 Deal.
1104065 1107759 - Looks like this is goodbye.<br />- Let's not make a big thing out of it.
1107777 1110505 How's this for not making a big thing?
1114910 1117137 Hey, Marla! Marla!
1119039 1122559 - Maybe we should exchange numbers.<br />- Should we?
1122709 1125020 We might wanna switch nights.
1126129 1127272 Okay.
1132761 1135363 <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>
1136765 1140542 <i>Maria's philosophy of life<br />was that she might die at any moment.</i>
1140560 1143170 <i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>
1143188 1145631 It doesn't have your name!<br />Who are you?
1145649 1148967 Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?
1148985 1152005 Any of the stupid names<br />you give each night?
1154783 1156885 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>
1157369 1159929 <i>SFO. LAX.</i>
1160914 1165435 <i>You wake up at O'Hare.<br />Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>
1166044 1170322 <i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.<br />Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>
1170340 1173450 Check-in for that flight<br />isn't for another two hours.
1173468 1177197 <i>This is your life,<br />and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>
1177889 1181034 <i>You wake up at Air Harbor international.</i>
1181810 1185580 <i>If you wake up at a different time,<br />in a different place,</i>
1185897 1188792 <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>
1189651 1192253 <i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>
1192904 1197634 <i>Single-sewing sugar, single-sewing cream,<br />single pat of butter.</i>
1198326 1201061 <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>
1201079 1206184 <i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample<br />package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>
1208336 1212440 <i>The people I meet on each flight,<br />they're single-sewing friends.</i>
1213717 1218613 <i>Between takeoff and landing, we have<br />our time together, but that's all we get.</i>
1219306 1220657 <i>Welcome!</i>
1222726 1224042 <i>On a long-enough time line,</i>
1224060 1227296 <i>the survival rate for<br />everyone drops to zero.</i>
1227314 1231091 <i>I was a recall coordinator.<br />My job was to apply the formula.</i>
1231109 1234261 The infant went through the windshield.<br />Three points.
1234279 1238432 <i>A new car built by my company<br />leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>
1238450 1240809 <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>
1240827 1243770 The teenager's braces<br />are stuck to the ashtray.
1243788 1246064 Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
1246082 1249026 <i>The car crashes and burns<br />with everyone trapped inside.</i>
1249044 1251521 <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>
1251755 1253238 The father must've been huge.
1253256 1257034 See where the fat burned to the seat?<br />The polyester shirt?
1257052 1258862 Very modern art.
1259054 1261872 <i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>
1261890 1264583 <i>Multiply it by the probable rate<br />of failure, 8.</i>
1264601 1268420 <i>Multiply the result by<br />the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>
1268438 1270874 <i>A x B x C...</i>
1270982 1272299 equals X.
1272317 1277005 If X is less than the cost of a recall,<br />we don't do one.
1278406 1281099 Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
1281117 1283094 You wouldn't believe.
1284662 1287223 Which car company do you work for?
1288083 1289559 A major one.
1292128 1295655 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply<br />on takeoff or landing,</i>
1295673 1299242 <i>I prayed for a crash<br />or a mid-air collision.</i>
1299260 1300653 <i>Anything.</i>
1310313 1314501 <i>Life insurance pays off triple<br />if you die on a business trip.</i>
1316736 1319756 "If you are seated<br />in an emergency exit row
1321116 1325936 "and feel unable or unwilling to perform<br />the duties listed on the safety card,
1325954 1329057 "please ask a flight attendant<br />to reseat you."
1330250 1334528 - It's a lot of responsibility.<br />- Wanna switch seats?
1334546 1338073 No. I'm not sure<br />I'm the man for that particular job.
1338091 1342278 An exit-door procedure<br />at 30,000 feet. Mm-hm.
1342846 1344822 The illusion of safety.
1345181 1346950 Yeah. I guess so.
1347725 1350627 You know why<br />they put oxygen masks on planes?
1350645 1354624 - So you can breathe.<br />- Oxygen gets you high.
1355567 1359295 In a catastrophic emergency,<br />you take giant panic breaths.
1359362 1363299 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.<br />You accept your fate.
1364701 1366761 It's all right here.
1367370 1370021 Emergency water landing, 600mph.
1370039 1373226 Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
1373710 1375478 That's, um...
1376254 1378898 That's an interesting theory.
1381009 1383618 - What do you do?<br />- What do you mean?
1383636 1385120 What do you do for a living?
1385138 1388199 Why? So you can pretend<br />you're interested?
1391352 1392419 Okay.
1392437 1395748 You have a kind of<br />sick desperation in your laugh.
1398776 1401337 We have the exact same briefcase.
1402322 1403555 Soap.
1403573 1406884 - Sorry?<br />- I make and I sell soap.
1407494 1409887 The yardstick of civilization.
1410497 1412272 <i>And this is how I met...</i>
1412290 1413975 "Tyler Durden."
1414334 1416234 Did you know if you mix gasoline
1416252 1419738 and frozen orange juice,<br />you can make napalm?
1419756 1422491 - No, I did not. Is that true?<br />- That's right.
1422509 1426161 One can make all kinds of explosives<br />using simple household items.
1426179 1428823 - Really?<br />- If one were so inclined.
1433937 1438916 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting<br />single-serving friend I've ever met.
1440485 1445048 - Everything on a plane is single-serving...<br />- Oh, I get it. Very clever.
1445323 1446758 Thank you.
1447534 1449601 How's that working out for you?
1449619 1451471 - What?<br />- Being clever.
1452914 1457226 - Great.<br />- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
1459128 1460237 Now, a question of etiquette.
1460255 1463441 As I pass,<br />do I give you the ass or the crotch?
1470765 1473166 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>
1473184 1476579 <i>Airlines have this policy<br />about vibrating luggage.</i>
1484821 1486388 Was it ticking?
1486406 1489766 Throwers don't worry.<br />Modern bombs don't tick.
1489784 1492512 - Sorry. Throwers?<br />- Baggage handlers.
1493663 1497816 But when a suitcase vibrates,<br />the throwers have to call the police.
1497834 1500569 My suitcase was vibrating?
1500587 1505983 Nine times out often it's an electric razor,<br />but... every once in a while...
1509012 1510655 it's a dildo.
1511764 1515875 It's company policy never to imply<br />ownership in the event of a dildo.
1515893 1521840 We have to use the indefinite article -<br />"a dildo", never "your dildo".
1521858 1523668 I don't own...
1526779 1533678 <i>I had everything in that suitcase.<br />My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>
1535288 1536931 <i>Never mind.</i>
1538916 1541644 Hey! That's my car!
1548593 1551536 <i>Home was a condo on<br />the 15th floor of a filing cabinet</i>
1551554 1553913 <i>for widows and young professionals.</i>
1553931 1555999 <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>
1556017 1559377 <i>A foot of concrete's important<br />when your next-door neighbor</i>
1559395 1562297 <i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>
1562315 1566676 <i>Or when a blast of debris<br />that used to be your personal effects</i>
1566694 1570590 <i>blows out of your windows<br />and sails flaming into the night.</i>
1576871 1579432 <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>
1592136 1594329 There's... nothing up there.
1594347 1597700 You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
1606401 1609003 Do you have somebody you can call?
1609654 1614175 <i>How embarrassing.<br />A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>
1624127 1626194 <i>The police later told me the pilot light</i>
1626212 1630191 <i>might have gone out,<br />letting out a little bit of gas.</i>
1631134 1633785 <i>That gas could have<br />slowly filled the condo...</i>
1633803 1636287 <i>1700 square feet with high ceilings...</i>
1636305 1638324 <i>for days and days.</i>
1645481 1649418 <i>Then the refrigerators compressor<br />could have clicked on.</i>
1651195 1652463 <i>Yeah?</i>
1655324 1657802 <i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>
1667336 1670982 <i>If you ask me now,<br />I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>
1713508 1715359 <i>- Hello?<br />- Who's this?</i>
1717470 1720079 <i>- Terr?<br />- Who is this?</i>
1720097 1721449 Um...
1721682 1724042 We met... We met on the airplane.
1724060 1726162 We had the same suitcase?
1726646 1730458 - Uh... the clever guy.<br /><i>- Oh, yeah. Right.</i>
1732652 1736596 I called a second ago.<br />There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
1736614 1739634 <i>Yeah, I *69'd you.<br />I never pick up my phone.</i>
1742245 1744180 <i>- So what's up?</i><br />- Uh...
1745122 1746515 Well...
1747250 1749018 You're not gonna believe this.
1752004 1753696 It could be worse.
1753714 1758319 A woman could cut off your penis<br />while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
1758678 1760655 There's always that.
1760930 1763866 It's just, when you buy furniture,<br />you tell yourself:
1764058 1766334 That's the last sofa I'll need.
1766352 1770213 Whatever else happens,<br />I've got that sofa problem handled.
1770231 1773542 I had it all.<br />I had a stereo that was very decent.
1773651 1776261 A wardrobe that was<br />getting very respectable.
1776279 1779013 I was close to being complete.
1779031 1782218 - Shit, man. And now it's all gone.<br />- All gone.
1782994 1784553 All gone.
1786497 1788766 Do you know what a duvet is?
1789250 1792353 - A comforter.<br />- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
1792795 1795280 Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?
1795298 1799568 Is this essential to our survival<br />in the hunter-gatherer sense?
1799719 1800987 No.
1801512 1805783 - What are we, then?<br />- I dunno. Consumers.
1805975 1808077 Right. We're consumers.
1808185 1811247 We are by-products of<br />a lifestyle obsession.
1812106 1815633 Murder, crime, poverty.<br />These things don't concern me.
1815651 1818587 What concerns me<br />are celebrity magazines,
1818988 1821431 television with 500 channels,
1821449 1823141 some guy's name on my underwear.
1823159 1825810 Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
1825828 1828556 - Martha Stewart.<br />- Fuck Martha Stewart.
1828998 1832609 She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.<br />It's all going down.
1832627 1836939 So fuck off with your sofa units<br />and Strinne green stripe patterns.
1837089 1839449 I say never be complete.
1839467 1841652 I say stop being perfect.
1841844 1843946 I say let's evolve.
1844221 1846782 Let the chips fall where they may.
1848684 1852670 But that's me, and I could be wrong.<br />Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
1852688 1856007 It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.
1856025 1859594 You did lose a lot of versatile solutions<br />for modern living.
1859612 1862381 Fuck, you're right.<br />No, I don't smoke.
1865701 1868846 My insurance is probably<br />gonna cover it, so...
1872375 1876771 - What?<br />- The things you own end up owning you.
1880091 1882359 But do what you like, man.
1884220 1885863 Oh, it's late.
1886389 1889158 - Hey, thanks for the beer.<br />- Yeah, man.
1889266 1891243 I should find a hotel.
1891435 1892870 - Oh!<br />- What?
1893896 1895004 What?
1895022 1896665 - A hotel?<br />- Yeah.
1896983 1899926 - Just ask, man.<br />- What are you talking about?
1899944 1903589 Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer<br />and you still can't ask.
1906575 1907600 - What?<br />- You called me
1907618 1909602 'cause you need a place to stay.
1909620 1913189 - Oh, hey. No, no, no.<br />- Yes, you did. So just ask.
1913207 1915851 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
1917586 1919821 Would... Would that be a problem?
1919839 1922233 Is it a problem for you to ask?
1923050 1925486 - Can I stay at your place?<br />- Yeah.
1927096 1928364 Thanks.
1932810 1935788 - I want you to do me a favor.<br />- Yeah, sure.
1935938 1938791 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1939191 1943879 - What?<br />- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1944697 1946924 <i>Let me tell you a little about Tyler Durden.</i>
1948117 1952186 Tyler was a night person.<br />While the rest of us slept, he worked.
1952204 1955106 He had one part-time job<br />as a projectionist.
1955124 1958693 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.<br />It comes on a few.
1958711 1962155 So someone has to switch the projectors<br />at the exact moment
1962173 1964741 that one reel ends<br />and the next one begins.
1964759 1969787 If you look, you can see little dots come<br />into the upper right corner of the screen.
1969805 1972707 In the industry,<br />we call them cigarette burns.
1972725 1974500 That's the cue for a changeover.
1974518 1979415 He flips the projectors, movie keeps<br />going and the audience has no idea.
1979648 1982216 Why would anyone want this shit job?
1982234 1985094 'Cause it affords him<br />interesting opportunities.
1985112 1988139 Like splicing a frame of pornography<br />into family films.
1988157 1990808 So when the snooty cat<br />and the courageous dog
1990826 1994145 with the celebrity voices first meet,
1994163 1997975 you'll catch a flash<br />of Tyler's contribution to the film.
2005341 2007658 Nobody knows<br />that they saw it but they did.
2007676 2009778 Nice big cock.
2014850 2017620 Even a hummingbird<br />couldn't catch Tyler at work.
2022983 2027838 Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet<br />waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
2032868 2036680 He was the guerrilla terrorist<br />of the food service industry.
2037039 2039273 Do not watch.<br />I cannot go when you watch.
2039291 2041192 Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
2041210 2043903 he farted on meringues,<br />sneezed on endives...
2043921 2046614 As for the cream of mushroom soup...
2046632 2050152 - Go ahead, tell 'em.<br />- You get the idea.
2050469 2053871 - You just want me to hit you?<br />- Come on. Do me this one favor.
2053889 2057208 - Why?<br />- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
2057226 2061580 - No. But that's a good thing.<br />- You can't know yourself if you haven't.
2061814 2064048 I don't wanna die without any scars.
2064066 2068344 - Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.<br />- Oh, God. This is crazy.
2068362 2070422 So go crazy! Let it rip.
2070781 2073724 - I don't know about this.<br />- I don't either.
2073742 2076727 Who gives a shit? No one's watching.<br />What do you care?
2076745 2079147 This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
2079165 2080766 That's right.
2081292 2084353 - Where? Like, in the face?<br />- Surprise me.
2086672 2088816 This is so fucking stupid.
2099393 2103921 Motherfucker!<br />You hit me in the ear!
2103939 2107209 - Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.<br />- Ow! Christ!
2107610 2108926 Why the ear, man?
2108944 2111470 - I fucked it up.<br />- No, that was perfect.
2111488 2113173 Ugh! Agh!
2124126 2126228 No, it's all right.
2127504 2129440 It really hurts.
2129632 2130899 Right.
2132051 2136530 - Hit me again.<br />- No, you hit me. Come on!
2153364 2155966 We should do this again sometime.
2168587 2170814 - Where's your car?<br />- What car?
2181850 2186170 <i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,<br />but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>
2186188 2189423 <i>It looked like it was<br />waiting to be torn down.</i>
2189441 2191884 <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>
2191902 2193469 <i>There was no lock on the front door</i>

2202288 2204890 <i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>
2205124 2206809 Yep. That's you.
2207543 2210069 That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
2210087 2211647 Yeah, thanks.
2212881 2214608 <i>What a shithole.</i>
2215718 2217486 <i>Nothing worked.</i>
2220347 2224208 <i>Turning on one light meant<br />another light in the house went out.</i>
2224226 2227586 <i>There were no neighbors.<br />Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>
2227604 2231625 <i>That fart smell of steam.<br />The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>
2233527 2235629 Hey. What have we here?
2250794 2252521 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hey.
2264475 2267710 <i>Every time it rained,<br />we had to kill the power.</i>
2267728 2271290 <i>By the end of the first month,<br />I didn't miss TV.</i>

2288791 2290559 Can I be next?
2294797 2296364 All right, man.
2296382 2297941 Lose the tie.

2326203 2328521 - What are you reading?<br />- Listen to this.
2328539 2332066 It's an article written<br />by an organ in the first person.
2332084 2334485 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
2334503 2336320 "Without me, Jack could not regulate
2336338 2339031 "his heart rate,<br />blood pressure or breathing."
2339049 2341242 There's a whole series of these.
2341260 2345663 "I Am Jill's Nipples."<br />"I Am Jack's Colon."
2345681 2348367 Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

2352020 2356291 <i>After fighting, everything else in life<br />got the volume turned down.</i>
2358652 2359677 What?
2359695 2363799 - You <i>could deal with anything.</i><br />- Have you finished those reports?
2368370 2370305 If you could choose,<br />who would you fight?
2371081 2373190 I'd fight my boss, probably.
2373208 2374476 Really?
2375377 2378814 - Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?<br />- I'd fight my dad.
2379047 2380865 I don't know my dad.
2380883 2384618 I mean, I know him, but he left<br />when I was, like, six years old.
2384636 2387246 Married this other woman<br />and had some other kids.
2387264 2389206 He did this every six years.
2389224 2393996 - He moves city and starts a new family.<br />- Fucker's setting up franchises.
2395772 2399717 My dad never went to college,<br />so it was real important that I go.
2399735 2401218 That sounds familiar.
2401236 2405139 So I graduate. I call him up long distance<br />and say, "Dad, now what?"
2405157 2407391 - He says, "Get a job."<br />- Same here.
2407409 2412180 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.<br />"Dad, now what?"
2412289 2414725 He says, "I dunno. Get married."
2416877 2418854 You can't get married.
2419171 2421148 I'm a 30-year-old boy.
2421298 2424450 We're a generation of men<br />raised by women.
2424468 2428363 I'm wondering if another woman<br />is really the answer we need.
2434061 2437372 <i>Most of the week,<br />we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>
2438607 2442252 <i>But every Saturday night,<br />we were finding something out.</i>
2443070 2446715 <i>We were finding out more and more<br />that we were not alone.</i>
2450452 2454647 <i>It used to be that when I came home angry<br />or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>
2454665 2457184 <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>
2457376 2459777 <i>I should have been<br />looking for a new condo,</i>
2459795 2462446 <i>haggling with my insurance company.</i>
2462464 2467361 <i>I should have been upset about my nice<br />flaming little shit - but I wasn't.</i>
2467594 2471539 The premise of cybernetting an office<br />is make things more efficient.
2471557 2474875 <i>Monday mornings,<br />all I thought about was next week.</i>
2474893 2477836 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
2477854 2479456 Absolutely.
2479648 2482250 Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
2482484 2484878 Because waste is a thief.
2485571 2489257 I showed this to my man here.<br />You liked it, didn't you?
2492661 2496056 <i>You can swallow a pint of blood<br />before you get sick.</i>
2497583 2501770 <i>It was right in everyone's face.<br />Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>
2501837 2506608 <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.<br />Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>
2517519 2520455 Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
2541835 2544479 Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
2566193 2569720 <i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules<br />that he and I decided.</i>
2569738 2571339 Gentlemen!
2571823 2573884 Welcome to Fight Club.
2576328 2580432 The first rule of Fight Club is<br />you do not talk about Fight Club.
2581083 2583685 The second rule of Fight Club is...
2583752 2586646 you do not talk about Fight Club!
2587589 2589073 Third rule of Fight Club:
2589091 2592660 someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
2592678 2594446 the fight is over.
2594721 2597449 Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
2598058 2600952 Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
2602270 2604998 Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
2605273 2609419 Seventh rule: fights will go on<br />as long as they have to.
2611738 2617260 And the eighth and final rule: if this is<br />your first night at Fight Club,
2618203 2619471 you have to fight.
2624251 2626068 <i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>
2626086 2630482 <i>couldn't remember whether<br />you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>
2631633 2633617 <i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>
2633635 2637364 <i>when he trounced<br />the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>
2639474 2641166 <i>Sometimes,<br />all you could hear were the flat,</i>
2641184 2644246 <i>hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>
2647691 2650926 <i>Or the wet choke<br />when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>
2650944 2652254 Stop!
2652696 2655431 <i>You weren't alive anywhere<br />like you were there.</i>
2655449 2660554 <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours<br />between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>
2661371 2663814 <i>Even if I could tell someone<br />they had a good fight,</i>
2663832 2666275 <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>
2666293 2667693 <i>Who you were in Fight Club</i>
2667711 2670654 <i>is not who you were<br />in the rest of the world.</i>
2670672 2675075 <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.<br />His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>
2675093 2678446 <i>After a few weeks,<br />he was carved out of wood.</i>
2679014 2681999 If you could fight any celebrity,<br />who would you fight?
2682017 2685245 - Alive or dead?<br />- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2686229 2688623 Hemingway. You?
2689983 2693128 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2694946 2697841 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>
2698450 2701928 <i>Everywhere we went,<br />we were sizing things up.</i>
2705874 2708484 <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>
2708502 2712613 <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein<br />or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>
2712631 2715150 Is that what a man looks like?
2715509 2718320 Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
2718637 2720913 Now, self-destruction...
2720931 2722449 Excuse me.
2757509 2760160 <i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>
2760178 2762238 <i>It wasn't about words.</i>
2764766 2769663 <i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,<br />like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>
2774651 2776544 - Is that it?<br />- Stop!
2776903 2779965 <i>When the fight was over,<br />nothing was solved.</i>
2780282 2782015 <i>But nothing mattered.</i>
2782033 2783218 Cool.
2785495 2788063 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>
2788081 2790600 Hey, man. How about next week?
2791585 2793603 How about next month?
2793837 2797023 Irvine, you're in the middle.<br />New guy, you too.
2799467 2801451 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>
2801469 2803571 He fell down some stairs.
2804097 2806282 I fell down some stairs.
2808351 2812796 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut<br />your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>
2812814 2814916 Okay. Any historical figure.
2815901 2819671 - I'd fight Gandhi.<br />- Good answer.
2820530 2822590 - How about you?<br />- Lincoln.
2822866 2824592 - Lincoln?<br />- Mm-hm.
2825118 2828847 Big guy, big reach.<br />Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
2829122 2830306 Fuck!
2832626 2835478 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
2844304 2845370 Hello?
2845388 2848290 <i>Where have you been<br />the last eight weeks?</i>
2848308 2849659 Marla?
2852938 2856089 - How did you find me?<br />- You left a forwarding number.
2856107 2859002 I haven't seen you at any support groups.
2859027 2862047 <i>We split 'em up.<br />That was the idea. Remember?</i>
2862405 2865341 Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
2865450 2867802 - How do you know?<br />- I cheated.
2869287 2871056 I found a new one.
2871247 2873475 - Really?<br />- It's for men only.
2873583 2875233 Like the testicle thing?
2875251 2876811 <i>Wham!</i>
2879673 2883325 - Look, this is a bad time.<br />- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
2883343 2886370 - Some really fucked-up people.<br />- I'm on my way out.
2886388 2889282 Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
2889557 2893627 I took what was left of a bottle.<br />It might have been too much.
2893645 2897714 <i>Picture Marla Singer throwing herself<br />around her crummy apartment.</i>
2897732 2901669 This isn't a for-real suicide.<br />It's probably a cry for help.
2902153 2903804 <i>This could go on for hours.</i>
2903822 2908093 - So you're staying in tonight?<br />- Do you wanna hear me describe death?
2908910 2913098 <i>Do you wanna listen<br />and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>
2915166 2917352 <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>
2943611 2945762 <i>Tyler's door was closed.</i>
2945780 2949050 <i>To been here for two months<br />and his door was never closed.</i>
2954956 2957441 You won't believe the dream<br />I had last night.
2957459 2960603 I can hardly believe<br />anything from last night.
2970472 2972532 What are you doing here?
2976311 2977836 - What?<br />- This is my house.
2977854 2979956 What are you doing here?
2981983 2983376 Fuck you!
2998458 3001644 Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
3002796 3005607 Limber, though. Silly cooze.
3007550 3011536 I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.<br />Guess who's on the other end.
3011554 3014157 <i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>
3017519 3020712 <i>Have you ever heard<br />a death rattle before?</i>
3020730 3023757 Do you think it'll live up to its name?
3023775 3026753 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>
3029948 3033509 <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>
3034035 3038806 <i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>
3038873 3042109 <i>How could Tyler, of all people,<br />think it was a bad thing</i>
3042127 3044812 <i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>
3045171 3049984 <i>...five, four, three...</i>
3050176 3051694 <i>Hang on.</i>
3056641 3058826 You got here fast.
3061229 3062872 Did I call you?
3064190 3065333 Huh?
3073575 3076803 The mattress is all sealed<br />in slippery plastic.
3079330 3082100 Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
3085378 3089148 Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
3101186 3104205 - Hey, where's 513?<br />- End of the hall.
3105523 3109092 The girl who lives there<br />used to be a charming, lovely girl.
3109110 3111303 She has lost faith in herself.
3111321 3114139 - Miss Singer, let us help you!<br />- She's a monster!
3114157 3118435 - You have every reason to live.<br />- She's infectious human waste!
3118453 3121472 - Miss Singer!<br />- Good luck trying to save her!
3127795 3131399 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
3133009 3135570 You're gonna have to keep me up...
3135970 3137739 all night.
3138056 3140074 Un-fucking-believable.
3140475 3142375 <i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>
3142393 3145872 - You know what I mean. You fucked her.<br />- No, I didn't.
3147315 3148750 - Never?<br />- No.
3150401 3153796 - You're not into her, are you?<br />- No! God, not at all.
3154072 3156306 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>
3156324 3159976 - Are you sure? You can tell me.<br />- Believe me, I'm sure.
3159994 3161311 <i>Put a gun to my head</i>
3161329 3163647 <i>- and spray my brains.</i><br />- That's good.
3163665 3166976 She's a predator posing as a house pet.<br />Stay away.
3169837 3172656 The shit that came out of<br />this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
3172674 3173941 My God.
3174217 3177612 I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.
3177762 3180538 <i>- Euch!<br />- How could Tyler not go for that?</i>
3180556 3183959 <i>The other night, he was splicing<br />sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>
3183977 3186378 Marla doesn't need a lover,<br />just a caseworker.
3186396 3189624 And a wash.<br />This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
3189983 3193051 <i>She invaded my support groups<br />and now my home.</i>
3193069 3194921 Hey, hey. Sit down.
3199284 3203228 - I can't have you talking to her about me.<br />- Why would I talk to her?
3203246 3205105 You say anything about me<br />or what goes on
3205123 3208518 in this house to her or anybody,<br />we're done.
3209252 3211145 - Now promise me.<br />- Okay.
3211546 3213196 - You promise?<br />- I promise.
3213214 3216116 - Promise.<br />- I just said, I promise! What...
3216134 3218569 That's three times you promised.
3219679 3223915 <i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes<br />and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>
3223933 3226327 <i>none of this would've happened.</i>
3230606 3233042 Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
3240992 3243685 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>
3243703 3247682 <i>On the third floor<br />where I might not have heard them.</i>
3248166 3249725 <i>But I didn't.</i>
3270396 3271497 <i>Ow!</i>
3274025 3277128 - What are you doing?<br />- Just going to bed.
3278654 3281466 - You wanna finish her off?<br />- Ooh!
3282825 3285970 - No. No, thank you.<br />- I found a cigarette.
3287497 3289599 - Who were you talking to?<br />- Shut up.
3290792 3294027 <i>I became the calm<br />little center of the world.</i>
3294045 3295980 <i>I was the Zen master.</i>
3301177 3303404 <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>
3303971 3306282 <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>
3307100 3308910 Is that your blood?
3310978 3312253 Some of it, yeah.
3312271 3313831 You can't smoke in here.
3316109 3319803 Take the rest of the day off.<br />Come back Monday with clean clothes.
3319821 3321679 Get yourself together.
3321697 3326719 <i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.<br />"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>
3326869 3330598 <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that.<br />I am enlightened."</i>
3333084 3337605 <i>You give up the condo life and<br />all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>
3337922 3341783 <i>go live in a dilapidated house<br />in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>
3341801 3344111 <i>...and you have to come home to this.</i>
3355773 3356840 Hello?
3356858 3360044 <i>This is Detective Stern<br />with the Arson Unit.</i>
3360486 3364514 <i>We have new information about<br />the incident at your former condo.</i>
3364532 3366391 - Yes?<br />- I don't know if you're aware,
3366409 3370520 but someone sprayed Freon<br />into your front-door lock.
3370538 3373523 <i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>
3373541 3377061 - No, I wasn't aware of that.<br /><i>- I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>
3377378 3381482 - Does this sound strange to you?<br /><i>- Yes, sir. Very strange.</i>
3381924 3383533 - The dynamite...<br />- Dynamite?
3383551 3387697 ...left a residue of<br />ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
3388139 3391617 <i>- Do you know What this means?</i><br />- No. What does it mean?
3391726 3393828 It means it was home-made.
3394520 3397505 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3397523 3400550 Whoever set this dynamite<br />could have blown out
3400568 3403553 your pilot light days before the explosion.
3403571 3406473 <i>- The gas was just a detonator.</i><br />- Who'd do such a thing?
3406491 3409010 <i>- I'll ask the questions.</i><br />- Tell him.
3409410 3413313 "The liberator who destroyed my property<br />realigned my perceptions."
3413331 3414856 <i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>
3414874 3418443 Yes. It's hard to know<br />what to make of this.
3418461 3420570 Have you recently made enemies
3420588 3422864 who might have access<br />to home-made dynamite?
3422882 3425533 - Enemies?<br />- "I reject civilization,
3425551 3427619 especially material possessions."
3427637 3430330 <i>- Son, this is serious.<br />- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>
3430348 3433249 - I <i>mean that.</i><br />- Yes, it's very serious.
3433267 3439165 Look, nobody takes this more seriously<br />than me. That condo was my life. Okay?
3439607 3442383 I loved every stick of<br />furniture in that place.
3442401 3445678 <i>That was not just a bunch of stuff<br />that got destroyed.</i>
3445696 3448264 <i>- It was me!<br />- I thank the Academy.</i>
3448282 3452637 <i>- Is this not a good time for you?</i><br />- Just tell him you fucking did it!
3452787 3456940 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3456958 3460902 <i>- Are you still there?</i><br />- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
3460920 3465691 No. I may need to talk to you, so you<br />let me know if you're gonna leave town.
3466384 3467902 <i>- Okay?</i><br />- Okay.
3471430 3472622 <i>Except for their humping,</i>
3472640 3475542 <i>Tyler and Marla were never<br />in the same room.</i>
3475560 3478294 <i>My parents pulled<br />this exact same act for years.</i>
3478312 3481791 The condom is the glass slipper<br />of our generation.
3482650 3485586 You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
3485653 3489465 You dance all night,<br />then you throw it away.
3490366 3493219 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3494495 3495680 What?
3500418 3503319 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
3503337 3505196 It was worth every penny.
3505214 3507358 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3509302 3513364 Someone loved it intensely for one day,
3514473 3516158 then tossed it.
3517685 3519620 Like a Christmas tree.
3520062 3521706 So special.
3522898 3524959 Then... barn!
3525735 3528045 It's on the side of the road.
3528487 3530715 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3532575 3539473 Like a sex-crime victim, underwear<br />inside out, bound with electrical tape.
3539874 3541976 Well, then, it suits you.
3542376 3544603 You can borrow it sometime.
3551719 3553320 Get rid of her.
3554055 3556706 - What? You get rid of her!<br />- Don't mention me.
3556724 3561036 <i>I am six years old again,<br />passing messages between parents.</i>
3564315 3567133 - It's time you left.<br />- Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3567151 3572131 - Not that we don't love your visits.<br />- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
3573824 3576392 <i>Gotta get off</i>
3576410 3577477 Thanks. Bye.
3577495 3582850 <i>Gotta get off of this merry-go-round</i>
3584627 3589356 <i>Gonna get, need to get, gotta get...</i>
3592927 3594278 You kids!
3595638 3598449 Why do you still waste time with her?
3599767 3602960 I'll say this about Marla.<br />At least she's trying to hit bottom.
3602978 3604497 And I'm not?
3604730 3608542 Sticking feathers up your butt<br />does not make you a chicken.
3608776 3610718 What are we doing tonight?
3610736 3612880 Tonight... we make soap.
3613906 3617259 - Really?<br />- To make soap, first we render fat.
3637471 3638955 The salt balance has to be just right,
3638973 3642159 so the best fat for soap<br />comes from humans.
3642810 3646080 - Wait. What is this place?<br />- A liposuction clinic.
3653863 3655714 Aha! Pay dirt!
3656490 3660427 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />The fat of the land!
3666000 3668936 No! Don't pull it.
3673549 3676068 - Oh, God!<br />- Give me another one.
3683309 3687830 As the fat renders, the tallows float<br />to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
3688105 3691792 - It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.<br />- Keep stirring.
3694069 3697680 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerin.
3697698 3700016 Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
3700034 3704346 If you then add sodium nitrate<br />and sawdust, you got dynamite.
3705247 3708065 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
3708083 3710818 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>
3710836 3714489 Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner<br />when washed in one part of the river.
3714507 3715941 - You know why?<br />- No.
3719970 3722872 Humans were once sacrificed<br />on the hills above.
3722890 3726702 Bodies burned, water seeped<br />through the ashes to create lye.
3727144 3729212 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3729230 3733841 Once it mixed with the melted body fat,<br />a soapy discharge crept into the river.
3733859 3736253 May I see your hand, please?
3743202 3744602 What is this?
3744620 3747480 - This is a chemical burn.<br />- Agh! Aaagh!
3747498 3750900 It'll hurt more than you've ever<br />been burned and leave a scar.
3750918 3753520 <i>If meditation worked for cancer,<br />it could work for this.</i>
3754088 3756607 - Don't shut the pain out.<br />- Oh, God!
3758509 3760535 The first soap was made<br />from heroes' ashes,
3760553 3762411 like the first monkey shot into space.
3762429 3765623 Without pain or sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3765641 3768459 <i>I tried not to think<br />of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>
3768477 3771462 Stop it! This is your pain,<br />this is your burning hand.
3771480 3774632 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3774650 3778386 No! Don't deal with this<br />the way those dead people do! Come on!
3778404 3779470 - I get the point!<br />- No!
3779488 3781882 You're feeling premature enlightenment.
3786287 3789146 It's the greatest moment of your life,<br />and you're missing it!
3789164 3790808 I am not...
3791292 3794277 Shut up! Our fathers<br />were our models for God.
3794295 3797272 If our fathers bailed,<br />what does that tell you about God?
3798632 3804071 Listen to me. You have to consider<br />the possibility that God does not like you.
3804096 3807790 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, he hates you.
3807808 3811294 This is not the worst thing<br />that can happen. We don't need him!
3811312 3814547 - I agree!<br />- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
3814565 3817133 We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
3817151 3821178 - I'm getting water!<br />- You can use water and make it worse or...
3821196 3822805 Look at me!
3822823 3826017 - Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />- Please let me have it, please!
3826035 3828387 First, you have to give up.
3828662 3831265 First, you have to know - not fear -
3831415 3834358 know that someday, you're gonna die.
3834376 3836770 You don't know how this feels!
3841550 3845696 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3846347 3847531 Okay.
3863030 3866759 Congratulations.<br />You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
3869787 3873522 <i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores<br />at $20 a bar.</i>
3873540 3875107 <i>God knows what they charged.</i>
3875125 3879063 - This is the best soap.<br />- Why, thank you, Susan.
3879380 3880988 <i>It was beautiful.</i>
3881006 3884818 <i>We were selling rich women<br />their own fat asses back to them.</i>
3886261 3888371 <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>
3888389 3890699 <i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>
3890724 3894543 "The first rule of Fight Club<br />is don't talk about Fight Club"?
3894561 3897922 <i>I'm half-asleep again.<br />I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>
3897940 3900542 "The second rule..." Is this yours?
3900985 3902385 Huh?
3902403 3905554 Pretend you're me.<br />Make a managerial decision.
3905572 3908092 You find this. What would you do?
3912955 3914973 Well, I gotta tell you,
3915040 3918401 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3918419 3921946 Because the person who wrote that<br />is dangerous.
3921964 3926492 And this button-down,<br />Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap
3926510 3929453 and then stalk from office to office
3929471 3934959 with an Armalite AR10 carbine<br />gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
3934977 3938705 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3940274 3943300 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.
3943318 3946672 Someone very, very close to you.
3947406 3950384 <i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>
3951535 3953519 <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>
3953537 3957015 Or maybe you shouldn't bring me<br />every piece of trash you pick up.
3960627 3963564 - Compliance and Liability.<br />- My tit's gonna rot off.
3965799 3968610 Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
3974099 3975207 What do you mean?
3975225 3978294 I need you to check<br />for a lump in my breast.
3978312 3982249 - Go to a hospital.<br />- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
3982858 3985252 I don't know about this, Marla.
3985319 3986802 Please?
3986820 3990090 <i>She didn't call Tyler.<br />I'm neutral in her book.</i>
3992451 3996638 That's nice. Taking food to...<br />Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
3996789 3998647 Where are they, exactly?
3998665 4003319 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4003337 4005237 - No, no.<br />- I got one for you.
4005255 4007274 Thanks for the thought.
4008509 4010736 What happened to your hand?
4011136 4012613 Oh, nothing.
4013972 4015699 - Right there?<br />- Mm.
4016517 4019036 - Feel anything?<br />- No.
4019061 4020787 Well, make sure.
4022064 4025292 - Okay, I'm pretty sure.<br />- You feel nothing?
4026360 4027878 No, nothing.
4029530 4032132 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
4033784 4037019 - No problem.<br />- I wish I could return the favor.
4037037 4039480 Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
4039498 4042351 - I could check your prostate.<br />- I think I'm okay.
4043210 4045145 Well, thanks, anyway.
4049925 4052368 - Are we done?<br />- Yeah, we're done.
4052386 4054696 See you... around.
4071738 4073764 Cornelius?
4073782 4076433 Cornelius!
4076451 4078894 It's me! Bob!
4078912 4080514 Hey, Bob.
4084376 4087570 - We all thought you were dead.<br />- No, no. Still here.
4087588 4089572 How are you, Bob?
4089590 4091365 Better than I've ever been in my whole life.
4091383 4094403 Really? Still Remaining Men Together?
4094428 4096537 No, no.<br />I got something so much better now.
4096555 4099373 Really, what is it?
4099391 4101333 Well...
4101351 4105247 The first rule is,<br />I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4106356 4107965 And the second rule is...
4107983 4109717 I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4109735 4113505 - And the third rule is...<br />- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
4114281 4116383 Look at my face, Bob.
4118285 4120644 That's fucking great.
4120662 4124016 - I've never seen you there.<br />- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4124958 4128228 - I go Saturday.<br />- Congratulations.
4128921 4130779 Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?
4130797 4133908 Have you heard about the guy<br />that invented it?
4133926 4136702 - Yeah, actually...<br />- I hear all kinds of things.
4136720 4140998 Supposedly, he was born<br />in a mental institution
4141016 4144793 and he sleeps only one hour a night.
4144811 4147414 - He's a great man.<br />- Oh...
4147814 4150250 Do you know about Tyler Durden?
4175342 4177534 I didn't hurt you, did I?
4177552 4180162 Actually, you did.
4180180 4183832 Thank you for this.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4183850 4186377 <i>Fight Club.</i>
4186395 4188205 <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>
4188855 4190673 <i>Our gift to the world.</i>
4190691 4194294 I look around, I look around,<br />I see a lot of new faces.
4196113 4198006 Shut up!
4198865 4203804 Which means a lot of people have been<br />breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
4211086 4215864 I see in Fight Club the strongest<br />and smartest men who've ever lived.
4215882 4219069 I see all this potential.<br />And I see it squandered.
4221138 4224540 Goddamn it,<br />an entire generation pumping gas.
4224558 4226417 Waiting tables.
4226435 4228954 Slaves with white collars.
4231064 4234049 Advertising has us chasing<br />cars and clothes.
4234067 4237629 Working jobs we hate<br />so we can buy shit we don't need.
4241241 4245679 We're the middle children of history, men.<br />No purpose or place.
4246413 4248564 We have no Great War.
4248582 4250684 No Great Depression.
4252294 4255279 Our great war is a spiritual war.
4255297 4258066 Our great depression is our lives.
4262429 4265831 We've all been raised on TV to believe<br />that one day we'd be millionaires
4265849 4268292 and movie gods and rock stars.
4268310 4270294 But we won't.
4270312 4273339 We're slowly learning that fact.
4273357 4276342 And we're very, very pissed off.
4276360 4278462 Yeah!
4280947 4283967 First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
4290248 4292274 Who are you?
4292292 4294978 - Who am I?<br />- Yeah.
4296129 4299698 There's a sign on the front<br />that says Lou's Tavern.
4299716 4304119 I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
4304137 4305822 Tyler Durden.
4308767 4311752 Who told you motherfuckers<br />you could use my place?
4311770 4314838 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
4314856 4319461 Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.<br />He don't own this place. I do.
4322239 4325224 - How much money does he get?<br />- There is no money.
4325242 4327059 - Really?<br />- Free to all.
4327077 4330312 - Ain't that something.<br />- It is, actually.
4330330 4332439 Look, stupid fuck!
4332457 4337562 - I want everybody out of here right now.<br />- Hey! You should join our club.
4338588 4341942 - Did you hear what I just said?<br />- You and your friend.
4345137 4346780 You hear me now?
4348348 4350450 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
4357065 4359925 Still not getting it.
4359943 4361718 Agh! Okay, okay, I got it.
4361736 4364297 I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
4365699 4367926 Back! All of you!
4368785 4370887 Everybody back!
4378420 4379896 Ah, Lou!
4380922 4384734 Come on, man! We really like this place.
4394060 4396712 - That's right, Lou. Get it out.<br />- Shut the fuck up.
4396730 4398415 Oh, yeah!
4402903 4405046 That's fucking funny?
4414289 4417100 Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
4418084 4419853 Unbelievable.
4424257 4426735 - You don't know where I've been, Lou.<br />- Oh, my God!
4427802 4430280 You don't know where I've been!
4433433 4436418 Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
4436436 4441507 - Fucking use the basement! Christ!<br />- I want your word, Lou! I want your word!
4441525 4443376 On my mother's eyes.
4452953 4454429 Thanks, Lou.
4456706 4458558 You too, big guy.
4462504 4464564 We'll see you next week.
4480146 4483875 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4485110 4489464 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4491992 4494219 You're gonna start a fight,
4494703 4496680 and you're gonna lose.
4499332 4501559 Excellent choice, sir.
4502836 4505647 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4505839 4508358 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>
4511761 4513738 What... Son of a bitch!
4513930 4518493 <i>Most people - normal people -<br />do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>
4520103 4521670 Excuse me!
4521688 4524006 You sprayed me with your hose.
4524024 4525591 That's not necessary.
4525609 4527377 Jay! Go call 911!
4530113 4531381 Put the hose down.
4532032 4533967 Stop it! Stop it!
4537162 4538513 Sorry.
4546212 4547397 You bastard!
4553553 4555280 We need to talk.
4557891 4559159 Okay.
4561019 4562328 Where to begin?
4562395 4565047 With your constant absenteeism?
4565065 4568042 With your unpresentable appearance?
4568068 4572846 - You're up for review.<br />- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4572864 4574890 - What?<br />- Let's pretend.
4574908 4577886 You're the Department<br />of Transportation, okay?
4578411 4583600 Someone informs you that this company<br />installs front-seat mounting brackets
4583625 4585817 that never pass collision tests,
4585835 4589071 brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
4589089 4593026 and fuel injectors<br />that explode and burn people alive.
4594427 4595862 What then?
4596388 4598789 - Are you threatening me?<br />- No...
4598807 4602243 - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!<br />- I have a better solution.
4602602 4605747 Keep me on the payroll<br />as an outside consultant
4606189 4607756 and, in exchange for my salary,
4607774 4611753 my job will be never to tell people<br />these things that I know.
4612570 4617265 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4617283 4621638 Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,<br />you crazy little shit?
4626251 4630146 - Security!<br /><i>- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>
4636594 4637904 Agh!
4639431 4641407 What the hell are you doing?
4650358 4651835 That hurt.
4654362 4656589 Why would you do that?
4656698 4659425 Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
4669836 4671771 What are you doing?
4672172 4674315 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4674340 4677986 <i>For some reason,<br />I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>
4678219 4679487 No!
4704454 4709149 <i>Under and behind and inside<br />everything this man took for granted,</i>
4709167 4712145 <i>something horrible had been growing.</i>
4712545 4716114 Look. Just give me the paychecks,<br />like I asked,
4716132 4718526 and you won't ever see me again.
4718551 4721946 <i>And right then,<br />at our most excellent moment together...</i>
4725433 4728077 Thank God! Please don't hit me again.
4728228 4730587 <i>Telephone, computer, fax machine,</i>
4730605 4734883 <i>52 weekly paychecks<br />and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>
4734901 4737469 <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>
4737487 4741174 <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have<br />Fight Club every night of the week.</i>
4743993 4748348 <i>Now, nobody was the center of Fight Club<br />except the two men fighting.</i>
4749123 4752393 <i>The leader walked through the crowd,<br />out in the darkness.</i>
4754087 4757614 <i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit<br />with the Pressman Hotel</i>
4757632 4759776 <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>
4766057 4768117 <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>
4776568 4778211 Thank you, sir.
4780613 4783306 <i>Tyler dreamed up<br />new homework assignments.</i>
4783324 4786219 <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>
4825742 4828845 - There's a Fight Club in Delaware City.<br />- Yeah, I heard.
4830663 4835317 There's one in Penns Grove too.<br />Bob even found one up in New Castle.
4835335 4838111 - Did you start that one?<br />- No, I thought you did.
4838129 4839313 No.
4890139 4892040 - Stop.<br />- What are we doing?
4892058 4893833 - Turn around.<br />- What are we doing?
4893851 4896544 - Homework assignment.<br />- What kind?
4896562 4898289 Human sacrifice.
4898606 4903510 - Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.<br />- It's a gun. Meet me in the back.
4903528 4906339 - Don't fuck around!<br />- Meet me in the back.
4906906 4909224 <i>On a long enough time line,</i>
4909242 4912011 <i>the survival rate for everyone<br />drops to zero.</i>
4913329 4916682 - Stop. What are you doing?<br />- Hands behind your back.
4916958 4918851 Give me your wallet.
4920503 4923940 Raymond K Hessel.<br />1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.
4923965 4925657 Cramped basement apartment?
4925675 4929320 - How did you know?<br />- They give shitty apartments letters.
4929971 4933081 Raymond! You're going to die.
4933099 4934367 <i>No!</i>
4935393 4936710 Is that your mom and dad?
4936728 4939295 They're gonna have to call<br />the kindly doctor.
4939313 4941506 Pick up your dental records. Know why?
4941524 4944961 - There'll be nothing left of your face.<br />- Come on!
4945278 4949590 An expired community college student ID.<br />What did you study, Raymond?
4949949 4952517 - S... Stuff.<br />- Stuff?
4952535 4954554 Were the midterms hard?
4955747 4958523 - I asked you what you studied!<br />- Biology, mostly.
4958541 4961735 - Why?<br />- I don't know.
4961753 4964564 What did you wanna be,<br />Raymond K Hessel?
4966215 4970486 The question, Raymond, was:<br />what did you want to be?
4972346 4973830 Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!
4973848 4976458 - Veterinarian. Veterinarian.<br />- Animals.
4976476 4979210 - Yeah. Animal and stuff.<br />- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
4979228 4982415 - So you need more schooling.<br />- Too much school.
4982482 4984507 - Would you rather be dead?<br />- No, please...
4984525 4988963 You'd rather die here, on your knees,<br />in the back of a convenience store?
4989697 4991883 <i>No. Please, no.</i>
4995620 4997722 I'm keeping your license.
4998164 5001184 Gonna check in on you.<br />I know where you live.
5002460 5005236 If you're not on your way to being<br />a veterinarian in six weeks,
5005254 5006606 you will be dead.
5009133 5010860 Now run on home.
5015556 5017617 Run, Forrest, run!
5019060 5020536 I feel ill.
5022730 5025965 - Imagine how he feels.<br />- Come on, this isn't funny!
5025983 5029260 What the fuck was the point of that?
5029278 5033014 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day<br />of Raymond K Hessel's life.
5033032 5037595 His breakfast will taste better<br />than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
5038746 5041140 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>
5041332 5043441 - Come <i>on.<br />- He had a plan.</i>
5043459 5046820 <i>And it started to make sense<br />in a Tyler sort of way.</i>
5046838 5050198 <i>No fear. No distractions.</i>
5050216 5054445 <i>The ability to let that<br />which does not matter truly slide.</i>
5067733 5069752 <i>You are not your job.</i>
5071863 5074048 You're not how much money<br />you have in the bank.
5076826 5079178 You're not the car you drive.
5079495 5082515 You're not the contents of your wallet.
5083374 5086060 You're not your fucking khakis.
5087587 5090398 You are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5099974 5102493 I'll be out of your way in a sec.
5103227 5105162 You don't have to go.
5106731 5108082 Whatever.
5109525 5113045 No, I mean... It's okay.
5122496 5124849 Are you still going to groups?
5125708 5126892 Yeah.
5129003 5130945 Chloe's dead.
5130963 5132440 Wow. Chloe.
5134050 5136451 When did that happen?
5136469 5137987 Do you care?
5138888 5141831 I dunno.<br />I haven't thought about it in a while.
5141849 5143409 Yeah, well...
5144185 5146746 It was the smart move on her part.
5148773 5150333 Listen, um...
5151150 5153927 What are you getting out of all this?
5153945 5155129 What?
5156155 5159224 I mean, all this. Why do you keep...
5159242 5161344 Is this making you happy?
5163162 5165097 Yeah, well, sometimes.
5166999 5168650 I don't know. I don't understand.
5168668 5174822 Why does a weaker person need to latch<br />on to a strong person? What is that?
5174840 5176942 What do you get out of it?
5178844 5183623 No... That's not the same thing at all.<br />It's totally different with us.
5183641 5184742 "Us"?
5185810 5189455 - What do you mean by "us"?<br />- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
5189480 5192333 - Hear what?<br />- All that noise. Hold on.
5192400 5195885 No, wait! Don't change the subject!<br />I want to talk about this.
5195903 5198763 - You're not talking about me, are you?<br />- No.
5198781 5202134 - What?<br />- You playing doctor. What was going on?
5202451 5205561 - What are you talking about?<br />- Nothing. Nothing.
5205579 5207647 - I don't think so.<br />- What do you want?
5207665 5209809 - Look at me.<br />- No. What?
5211544 5214362 - What is that?<br />- It's nothing. Don't worry.
5214380 5217400 - My God. Who did this?<br />- A person.
5217425 5218866 Guy or girl?
5218884 5221577 - What do you care?<br />- What do you care if I ask?
5221595 5223288 - Leave me alone.<br />- You're afraid to say.
5223306 5226082 - I am not. Let me go.<br />- No! Talk to me.
5226100 5227959 Let go of me. Leave me alone!
5227977 5230044 - This conversation...<br />- This conversation...
5230062 5232665 - ...is over.<br />- ...is over.
5234567 5237086 I just can't win with you, can I?
5245453 5247138 Hey, this is getting a little old!
5249832 5251649 What is... What is all this?
5251667 5253519 What do you think?
5254837 5256904 Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
5256922 5258232 Hey!
5265890 5268075 Too young. Sorry.
5269810 5271461 What's all that?
5271479 5275131 Tell the applicant<br />if he's too young, too old or too fat.
5275149 5276424 Applicant?
5276442 5280094 If the applicant waits three days<br />without food or shelter,
5280112 5282638 he may enter and begin training.
5282656 5284508 Training for what?
5290081 5292023 You think this is a game?
5292041 5294359 You're too young to train here,<br />end of story.
5294377 5297062 Quit wasting our time.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
5301592 5304369 Bad news, friend.
5304387 5307080 It's not gonna happen.
5307098 5309123 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
5309141 5312495 It's not the end of the world.<br />Just... go away.
5313896 5315206 Go.
5315940 5319502 You're trespassing<br />and I will have to call the police.
5323322 5327934 Don't you look at me!<br />You're never getting in this fucking house!
5327952 5331354 Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!<br />Get off my porch!
5331372 5334607 <i>Sooner or later,<br />we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>
5334625 5337937 I'm gonna go inside<br />and I'm gonna get a shovel.
5345678 5349573 Got two black shirts?<br />Two pair of black pants?
5349598 5352667 - Yes, sir.<br />- One pair black boots? Black socks?
5352685 5354210 - Sir.<br />- One black jacket?
5354228 5356504 - Sir.<br />- $300 personal burial money?
5356522 5358457 Yes, sir.
5360401 5361835 All right.
5372538 5374598 You're too old, fat man.
5375374 5378310 Your tits are too big.<br />Get the fuck off my porch.
5386010 5387486 Bob! Bob!
5403736 5407089 Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
5407114 5408924 Space monkey.
5409283 5412720 Ready to sacrifice himself<br />for the greater good.
5418250 5421270 You are too fucking old, fatty!
5421295 5426191 And you... You're too fucking blond!
5426258 5428736 Get out of here, the both of you!
5429345 5430745 <i>And so it went.</i>
5430763 5432615 <i>Listen up, maggots.</i>
5433224 5435583 <i>You are not special.</i>
5435601 5438829 <i>You are not<br />a beautiful or unique snowflake.</i>
5439605 5443000 <i>You are the same decaying organic matter<br />as everything else.</i>
5443651 5445885 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>
5445903 5450181 <i>We are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.</i>
5450199 5453218 <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>
5455454 5458272 <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>
5458290 5462019 <i>To what purpose? For what greater good?</i>
5465631 5467650 <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>
5472137 5477701 When he was like,<br />"You are not your job," I was like, "Yeah!"
5480521 5482748 - Hey, What's all this?<br />- Hey!
5485359 5487426 Okay!
5487444 5489595 - What's going on?<br />- We're celebrating.
5489613 5491965 - What are we celebrating?<br />- Go on.
5496412 5498889 - Hey.<br />- Let me get that for you.
5503252 5506605 <i>Same great taste.<br />Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>
5507506 5509441 Shh!
5510092 5514697 <i>Investigators are on the scene.<br />The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>
5514888 5518249 <i>Could you tell us<br />what you think has happened here?</i>
5518267 5522253 <i>We believe this is one of many<br />recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>
5522271 5525624 <i>somehow related to<br />underground boxing clubs.</i>
5526025 5529461 <i>We will be coordinating<br />a rigorous investigation.</i>
5530279 5533514 <i>That was Commissioner Jacobs<br />who just arrived on the scene</i>
5533532 5539179 <i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...</i><br />- She's hot.
5539288 5541432 <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>
5541665 5543350 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
5544752 5547062 - Holy shit!<br />- Yeah!
5553677 5556029 What the fuck did you guys do?
5556347 5558824 <i>Arson investigators<br />are on the premises...</i>
5565064 5569501 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions, sir.
5575574 5579511 <i>The victory in the war against crime<br />will not come overnight.</i>
5579662 5584224 <i>It will take dedication and commitment<br />and, most of all, cooperation.</i>
5584375 5587936 <i>Streets are safer now.<br />There is hope in the inner city.</i>
5588337 5591356 - However...<br />- I gotta take a piss.
5592091 5595743 <i>These are the first steps in a long journey.</i>
5595761 5597119 <i>That is why we have<br />created Project Hope...</i>
5597137 5598537 Bob.
5598555 5601825 <i>...helping others<br />with prevention and enforcement.</i>
5602601 5604877 <i>Project Hope will be a joint effort</i>
5604895 5607372 <i>between the police<br />and community leaders.</i>
5607940 5611710 <i>It will be a powerful new weapon<br />in the war against crime.</i>
5658532 5663053 - Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.<br />- Man! His balls are ice-cold.
5663829 5667022 Hi. You're gonna call off<br />your rigorous investigation.
5667040 5669859 You will publicly state<br />there is no underground group
5669877 5673487 or these guys are gonna take your balls.
5673505 5678242 They'll send one to the New York Times<br />and one to the LA Times.
5678260 5682037 Look, the people you are after<br />are the people you depend on.
5682055 5686159 We cook your meals. We haul your trash.<br />We connect your calls.
5686185 5689997 We drive your ambulances.<br />We guard you while you sleep.
5694359 5696253 Do not fuck with us.
5705788 5707264 Ball check!
5722054 5723864 Bob, this way.
5724807 5726366 Let's go.
5727476 5730579 <i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>
5730979 5732122 Hey!
5747704 5749056 Yeah!
5781488 5786677 <i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda<br />that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>
5789788 5792606 <i>I wanted to open<br />the dump valves on oil tankers</i>
5792624 5795978 <i>and smother all those French beaches<br />I'd never see.</i>
5800173 5802609 <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>
5819318 5821753 Where did you go, psycho boy?
5823071 5826091 I felt like destroying something beautiful.
5830162 5832848 - Get him to a fucking hospital.<br />- Yeah.
5844676 5848280 Don't worry, Mr. Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.
5849181 5851074 <i>After you, Mr. Burden.</i>
5852434 5853869 After you.
5871787 5874647 - Something on your mind, dear?<br />- No.
5874665 5877483 Yeah. Why wasn't I told<br />about Project Mayhem?
5877501 5881528 First rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions.
5881546 5885199 - Why wasn't I included in the beginning?<br />- Fight Club was the beginning.
5885217 5888494 Now it's left the basements<br />and it's Project Mayhem.
5888512 5891455 We started Fight Club<br />together. Remember?
5891473 5893325 It's as much mine as it is yours.
5893350 5897419 - Is this about you and me?<br />- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
5897437 5899630 This does not belong to us.
5899648 5902667 - We are not special.<br />- Fuck that. You should have told me.
5904403 5905545 Hey, Tyler!
5908156 5910307 - Goddamn it, Tyler!<br />- What do you want?
5910325 5913602 A statement of purpose?<br />Should I email you?
5913620 5916313 - Look...<br />- You decide your level of involvement!
5916331 5918649 I will! I wanna know certain things first!
5918667 5921186 - The first rule of Project Mayhem...<br />- Shut up!
5922921 5926691 - I wanna know what you're thinking.<br />- Fuck What you know!
5927259 5930577 Forget about what you think you know<br />about life, friendship,
5930595 5933198 and especially about you and me.
5934349 5937077 What is that supposed to mean? What...
5939438 5941540 What are you doing?
5943150 5945175 What'll you wish you'd done<br />before you die?
5945193 5947921 - Paint a self-portrait.<br />- Build a house.
5948155 5950764 - And you?<br />- I don't know. Nothing.
5950782 5953100 - Get in the right lane.<br />- You have to know!
5953118 5955978 If you died now,<br />how would you feel about your life?
5955996 5960441 I don't know! Nothing good.<br />Is that what you want to hear me say?
5960459 5962276 - Come on!<br />- Not good enough.
5962294 5964563 Stop fucking around! Tyler!
5967591 5969283 Jesus Christ!
5969301 5971785 Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
5971803 5975782 Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!<br />I am sick of all your shit!
5977184 5979327 Okay, man. Okay.
5980103 5982414 - Quit screwing around. Steer!<br />- Look at you!
5982481 5985716 - Steer!<br />- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
5985734 5990463 - Why? Why? What are you talking about?<br />- Why do you think I blew up your condo?
5991364 5992639 What?
5992657 5996428 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.<br />It's not a goddamn seminar.
5997162 6000432 Stop trying to control everything<br />and just let go!
6003418 6005812 - Let go!<br />- All right. Fine.
6007297 6008523 Fine.
6067607 6070126 <i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>
6071236 6073387 <i>This must have been<br />what all those people felt like</i>

6077325 6078635 Goddamn!
6082706 6085433 We've just had a near-life experience!

6198280 6201216 <i>Cooking and working<br />and sleeping in teams.</i>
6204369 6206137 Hang on a second.
6225807 6227409 It's under control, sir.
6230562 6232170 Where's Tyler?
6232188 6235048 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not...
6235066 6237335 Right. Okay.
6239571 6241172 <i>I'm all alone.</i>
6241656 6245135 <i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>
6245618 6247720 <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>
6252208 6255854 <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem<br />only Tyler knows.</i>
6256588 6259691 <i>The second rule is<br />you do not ask questions.</i>
6262719 6265738 Get the fuck away from me!<br />Get the fuck away!
6266473 6268575 Who are all these people?
6273188 6275540 The Paper Street Soap Company.
6277984 6279586 Can I come in?
6282781 6284382 He's not here.
6285075 6286259 What?
6287786 6290638 Tyler isn't here.
6291790 6293857 Tyler went away.
6293875 6295435 Tyler's gone.
6311768 6313661 Jesus! Get some help!
6326491 6330220 Two gunshot wounds coming through!<br />Make some fucking room!
6330537 6332646 What happened? What happened?
6332664 6334022 We were on assignment.
6334040 6337227 We were supposed to kill<br />two birds with one stone.
6337293 6339861 Destroy a piece of corporate art...
6339879 6342440 Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
6343842 6346444 ...and trash a franchise coffee bar.
6352350 6354953 We had it all worked out, sir.
6362735 6366138 - It went smooth until...<br />- Police! Freeze!
6366156 6369050 - What?<br />- They shot Bob.
6370535 6373471 - They shot him in the head.<br />- Fucking pigs!
6378293 6380026 Oh, God!
6380044 6383982 - Those motherfuckers!<br />- You morons.
6384382 6387409 You run around in ski masks<br />trying to blow things up?
6387427 6390071 What did you think was gonna happen?
6393224 6396918 Okay, quick! We gotta<br />get rid of the evidence - his body!
6396936 6399080 - Bury him.<br />- What?
6399189 6401833 Take him to the garden and bury him.
6402484 6406761 - Come on, people, let's go!<br />- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
6406779 6408221 What are you talking about?
6408239 6411175 This isn't fucking evidence.<br />This is a person.
6411242 6414352 He's my friend<br />and you're not burying him in the garden!
6414370 6417147 He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
6417165 6420066 - This is Bob.<br />- But, sir, in...
6420084 6422402 In Project Mayhem, we have no names.
6422420 6423820 Now, you listen to me.
6423838 6428408 This is a man and he has a name,<br />and it's Robert Paulsen, okay?
6428426 6429576 Robert Paulsen?
6429594 6431995 He's a man,<br />and he's dead now because of us.
6432013 6433948 Do you understand that?
6434933 6436534 I understand.
6438686 6443166 In death, a member of Project Mayhem<br />has a name.
6444901 6447086 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6447779 6450006 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6450532 6453509 His name... is Robert Paulsen.
6454369 6457055 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6457121 6460433 - Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.<br />- His name is Robert Paulsen.
6463920 6466522 Shut up! This is all over with!
6501165 6502274 Tyler?
6502292 6504894 No, this is Detective Stern<br />of the Arson Unit.
6505003 6506604 <i>I need to see you...</i>
6511092 6515321 <i>I went to all the cities<br />on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>
6515930 6517330 <i>I didn't know how,</i>
6517348 6520500 <i>but I could look at 50 different bars,<br />and somehow I just knew.</i>
6520518 6525130 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.<br />It's very important that I talk to him.
6525148 6527208 I wish I could help you,
6527317 6528459 sir.
6534699 6536634 <i>Every city I went to,</i>
6537702 6540228 <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>
6540246 6542598 <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>
6543249 6544392 Hey! Hey!
6545543 6546811 Taxi!
6546878 6548403 Look at my face. I'm a member.
6548421 6551698 Now, I just need to know<br />if you've seen Tyler.
6551716 6555410 I'm not exposed to bespeak<br />any such information to you,
6555428 6559866 nor would I, even if I had said information<br />at this juncture, be able.
6561893 6564495 - You're a moron.<br />- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
6566064 6571252 <i>Tyler had been busy,<br />setting up franchises all over the country.</i>
6573946 6577341 <i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>
6578368 6581179 <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>
6582080 6584522 - We've just heard the stories.<br />- What stories?
6584540 6589228 - Nobody knows what he looks like.<br />- He has plastic surgery every three years.
6589671 6591863 That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
6591881 6596360 - Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?<br />- Is Mr. Durden building an army?
6597095 6600323 <i>I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.</i>
6601099 6604368 <i>Everywhere I went,<br />I felt I'd already been there.</i>
6605019 6607830 <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>
6608940 6611167 <i>The smell of dried blood.</i>
6612110 6615136 <i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>
6615154 6618174 <i>That aroma of old sweat,<br />like fried chicken.</i>
6618783 6623144 <i>The fee! of a floor still warm<br />from a fight the night before.</i>
6623162 6626015 <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>
6628876 6634232 His name is Robert Paulsen.<br />His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
6636968 6638736 Welcome back, sir.
6640096 6641864 How have you been?
6642890 6644534 Do you know me?
6644976 6648079 - Is this a test, sir?<br />- No. This is not a test.
6649647 6652041 You were in here last Thursday.
6652483 6653835 Thursday?
6654277 6658548 You were standing where you are now,<br />asking how good security is.
6658990 6661133 It's tight as a drum, sir.
6663161 6665137 Who do you think I am?
6665830 6669600 - Are you sure this isn't a test?<br />- No, this is not a test.
6671085 6672812 <i>You're Mr. Burden.</i>
6673671 6676107 You're the one who gave me this.
6677091 6680903 <i>Please return your seat backs<br />to their full upright and locked position.</i>
6692607 6694174 <i>- Yeah?<br />- Marla, it's me.</i>
6694192 6696384 - Have we ever done it?<br />- Done <i>what?</i>
6696402 6699554 - Had sex.<br />- What kind of stupid question is that?
6699572 6702807 Stupid because the answer's yes<br />or because it's no?
6702825 6704893 - Is this a trick?<br />- No. I need to know...
6704911 6709481 You wanna know if I think<br />we were just having sex or making love?
6709499 6712226 <i>- We did make love?<br />- Is that what you're calling it?</i>
6712376 6715695 Just answer the question!<br />Did we do it or not?
6715713 6718531 You fuck me, then snub me.<br />You love me, you hate me.
6718549 6721201 You're sensitive,<br />then you turn into an asshole.
6721219 6723988 Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
6724555 6726741 <i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>
6726808 6728666 - What did you say?<br />- What is wrong with you?
6728684 6731211 - Say my name!<br />- Terr Durden.
6731229 6733880 Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!<br />What's going on?
6733898 6736042 - I'm coming over!<br />- I'm not there!
6738027 6740136 You broke your promise.
6740154 6742514 - Jesus, Tyler.<br />- You talked to her about me.
6742532 6747769 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.
6747787 6750306 Why do people think that I'm you?
6750790 6752224 Answer me!
6756254 6757438 Sit.
6760633 6763736 Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
6763928 6765745 I think you know.
6765763 6767914 - No, I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6767932 6771077 Why would anyone<br />possibly confuse you with me?
6772395 6774163 I... I don't know.
6778609 6780544 - You got it.<br />- No.
6780695 6783547 - Do not fuck with us!<br />- Say it.
6784991 6786425 Because”.
6788119 6789428 Say it!
6791330 6793724 Because we're the same person.
6793875 6795024 That's right.
6795042 6797694 <i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing...</i>
6797712 6801489 - I don't understand this.<br />- You wanted a way to change your life.
6801507 6803783 You could not do this on your own.
6803801 6807154 All the ways you wish you could be -<br />that's me.
6808222 6810582 I look like you wanna look,<br />fuck like you wanna fuck,
6810600 6815871 I am smart, capable and, most importantly,<br />I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
6816063 6817171 Oh, no.
6817189 6820425 - Terr's not here. Tyler went away.<br />- What?
6820443 6824797 - This isn't possible. This is crazy.<br />- People do it every day.
6824947 6828808 They talk to themselves.<br />They see themselves as they'd like to be.
6828826 6832972 They don't have the courage you have<br />to just run with it.
6835207 6838902 You still wrestle with it,<br />so sometimes you're still you.
6838920 6840563 We should do this again sometime.
6840838 6843156 Other times,<br />you imagine you're watching me.
6843174 6846117 If this is your first time, you have to fight.
6846135 6849905 Little by little,<br />you're just letting yourself become...
6851766 6852999 Tyler Durden.
6853017 6856662 You are not your job<br />or how much money you have!
6856979 6858755 - No. You have a house.<br />- Rented in your name.
6858773 6862460 - You have jobs, a life.<br />- You work nights because you can't sleep.
6862526 6866429 - Or you stay up and make soap.<br />- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
6866447 6869091 Technically, you are.<br />But it's all the same to her.
6871661 6873304 Oh, my God.
6874038 6876223 Now you see our dilemma.
6876707 6878684 She knows too much.
6879502 6882813 I think we're gonna have to talk about<br />how this might compromise our goals.
6884882 6887193 What... What are you saying?
6887218 6891287 This is bullshit. This is bullshit!<br />I'm not listening to this.
6891305 6894374 - You are insane!<br />- No. You're insane.
6894392 6897661 And we simply<br />do not have time for this crap.
6899271 6901255 <i>It's called a changeover.</i>
6901273 6905419 <i>The movie goes on,<br />and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>
6919083 6922777 - Sir! Are you checking out?<br />- Yeah. Bill me.
6922795 6926357 I need you to initial<br />this list of phone calls, please.
6929760 6933572 - When were these made?<br />- Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
6938936 6941337 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier<br />every night?</i>
6941355 6943624 <i>Have I been sleeping later?</i>
6945109 6948129 <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>
6951782 6953467 Is anybody here?
6955786 6958389 <i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>
6959457 6962601 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
6965254 6966814 Oh, my God.
6970468 6972570 <i>- 1888.</i><br />- Who am I calling?
6972887 6975239 <i>Franklin. This is maintenance.</i>
6976682 6979333 <i>Hello? Hello?</i>
6979351 6981078 Franklin Street?
6982146 6984206 <i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>
6986692 6989378 <i>- Hello?</i><br />- Yeah, yeah.
6989820 6992055 I need to talk to your supervisor<br />right away.
6992073 6994098 <i>- Speaking.</i><br />- Okay, listen <i>to me.</i>
6994116 6997268 Something terrible<br />is about to happen to your building.
6997286 6999346 <i>It's under control, sir.</i>
6999955 7003517 - Excuse <i>me?<br />- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>
7007421 7008606 <i>2160.</i>
7016931 7019617 Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
7021393 7024045 Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7024063 7026672 Your bald freaks hit me<br />with a fucking broom!
7026690 7028466 They almost broke my arm!
7028484 7030304 They were burning<br />their fingertips with lye.
7032113 7034972 It'll take a tremendous act of faith<br />on your part, but hear me out.
7034990 7038802 - Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />- A little more faith than that.
7043082 7044982 I don't wanna hear<br />anything you have to say.
7045000 7047819 You have every right to be...
7047837 7049487 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7049505 7052107 Sir, anything you order<br />is free of charge, sir.
7053217 7055986 - Why is it free of charge?<br />- Don't ask.
7056095 7057411 Whatever.
7057429 7058955 I'll have the clam chowder,
7058973 7062375 fried chicken with a baked potato<br />and chocolate chiffon pie.
7062393 7064544 Clean food, please.
7064562 7067213 In that case, sir,<br />I advise against the clam chowder.
7067231 7069458 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7071986 7074088 You got about 30 seconds.
7075614 7078926 I know I've been acting very strange, okay?
7079160 7081727 I know it seems there's two sides to me...
7081745 7083896 Two sides?<br />You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
7083914 7087316 I deserved that.<br />But I realized something important.
7087334 7088609 What?
7088627 7091946 The full extent of our relationship<br />wasn't clear to me until now,
7091964 7094073 for reasons I won't go into.
7094091 7096576 - I know I haven't treated you well.<br />- Whatever.
7096594 7101115 No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!<br />Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
7101557 7103749 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
7103767 7107538 What I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7109607 7111500 - You do?<br />- I really do.
7112151 7116637 I care about you and I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7116655 7119383 Your life is in danger.
7121118 7124054 - What?<br />- You need to leave town for a while.
7124079 7126439 Get out of any major city.<br />Just go camping...
7126457 7128232 You're an insane person.
7128250 7132069 - I've involved you in something terrible.<br />- No. Shut up!
7132087 7134273 - You're not safe.<br />- Shut up!
7136634 7140904 - Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />- I know you did.
7140971 7146243 There are things about you I like.<br />You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
7146810 7149496 But... you're intolerable.
7150064 7153966 You have very serious emotional problems
7153984 7155968 for which you should seek<br />professional help.
7155986 7160257 - I know, and I'm sorry.<br />- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.
7161533 7163635 I can't do this anymore.
7164370 7166930 I can't. I won't.
7168707 7170100 I'm gone.
7170960 7173270 You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7176799 7178574 - Marla, you don't understand!<br />- Leave me alone!
7178592 7180903 I am trying to protect you!
7181011 7184281 - I never want to see you again!<br />- If that's what it takes...
7184556 7186408 Wait right here.
7190729 7192790 Hold it right there! Shut up!
7193315 7196835 Take this money and get on this bus.<br />I promise I will never bother you again.
7198028 7199387 Shut up!
7199405 7202466 Please get on the bus.<br />Please get on the bus.
7203909 7206811 - Why are you doing this?<br />- They think you're a threat.
7206829 7209021 I can't explain now. Trust me.
7209039 7211023 If I see where you're going,<br />you won't be safe.
7211041 7213734 I'm not paying this back.<br />I consider it asshole tax.
7213752 7217613 Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities<br />for a couple of days, okay?
7217631 7218982 Tyler...
7220384 7222736 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7237609 7240212 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7240779 7243097 I am the leader of a terrorist organization
7243115 7247719 responsible for numerous acts<br />of vandalism and assault all over this city.
7248287 7251849 In the metropolitan area,<br />we had probably 200 members.
7252166 7256235 Chapters have sprung up<br />in five or six other major cities already.
7256253 7259530 This is a tightly regimented organization
7259548 7264194 with many cells capable of operating<br />independent of central leadership.
7265095 7269032 Go to the house, okay? 1537 Paper Street.
7269558 7271250 That's our headquarters.
7271268 7276206 In the back, buried in the garden,<br />you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7277441 7279842 In the basement, you'll find some bathtubs
7279860 7284548 that have been used very recently<br />to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7285699 7288601 I believe the plan is<br />to blow up the headquarters
7288619 7290519 of these credit-card companies
7290537 7292431 and the TRW building.
7294083 7297561 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit-card companies?
7297836 7301356 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7302132 7304318 You'll create total chaos.
7306762 7309865 Keep him talking.<br />I need to make a phone call.
7319900 7322419 I really admire what you're doing.
7323487 7326298 - What?<br />- You're a brave man to order this.
7327157 7329016 You're a genius, sir.
7329034 7333138 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7334164 7335807 we gotta get his balls.
7336834 7340361 - Don't fight.<br />- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
7340379 7343614 - It'll set quite an example.<br />- You're making a big mistake!
7343632 7345908 - You said you'd say that.<br />- I'm not Tyler Durden!
7345926 7348320 You told us you'd say that too.
7348762 7350830 All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7350848 7355543 Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.<br />We're aborting this mission now.
7355561 7358372 You said you would definitely say that.
7360065 7361708 <i>Let me go!</i>
7362860 7366630 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7368323 7369849 Is somebody timing this?
7369867 7371760 Keep your mouth shut.
7372953 7374137 Shit!
7377708 7380811 - Some of this information checks out.<br />- Uh-huh?
7381086 7384064 - Let's go to that house on Paper Street.<br />- Be right there.
7385299 7386483 Hey, wait!
7386550 7387867 - You got him?<br />- I got him.
7387885 7389577 Sir, we have to do this.
7389595 7392413 - Stop fighting!<br />- Where's the rubber band?
7392431 7395534 Get away from me!<br />Drop that fucking knife!
7398479 7402124 Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
7404151 7406128 Get down on the floor!
7410574 7414761 First person that comes out this door<br />gets a lead salad! Understand?
7439520 7441538 Get away! Stay away!
7454576 7455844 <i>I ran.</i>
7457246 7461224 <i>I ran until my muscles burned<br />and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>
7463877 7466021 <i>Then I ran some more.</i>
7507462 7510531 What the fuck are you doing,<br />running around in your underpants?
7510549 7512408 You look crazy!
7512426 7515494 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7515512 7520409 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. It'll be like Pay-per-view.
7568982 7570341 Oh, Christ.
7570359 7572259 Now what are you doing?
7572277 7574463 - I'm stopping this.<br />- Why?
7574905 7578766 - The greatest thing you've ever done.<br />- I can't let this happen.
7578784 7581011 There are 10 other bombs<br />in 10 other buildings.
7581495 7583687 Since when is Project Mayhem<br />about murder?
7583705 7589026 The buildings are empty. We're not<br />killing anyone. We're setting them free!
7589044 7591938 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7592464 7594615 You wanna make an omelet,<br />you gotta break eggs.
7594633 7598028 No. I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7605310 7609296 Wouldn't do that.<br />Not unless I knew which wires were what.
7609314 7611374 If you know, then I know.
7616613 7621551 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />all day thinking about the wrong ones.
7629835 7631269 You think?
7632504 7635114 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7635132 7637692 Pull any one but the green one.
7642681 7645242 I asked you not to do that!
7647477 7648745 Fuck!
7649938 7652249 Tyler, get away from the van.
7654151 7657254 Tyler, I'm not kidding!<br />Get away from the van!
7658071 7659548 Goddamn it!
7660824 7663093 Whoa! Whoa!
7666121 7667438 Okay.
7667456 7670649 You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend
7670667 7673436 near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
7675672 7677858 Cool it, Tyler!
7690729 7693540 Aw, come on! Don't go!
7732562 7733747 What?
7779276 7782921 Three minutes. This is it.
7783154 7785347 The beginning.
7785365 7786890 Ground zero.
7786908 7791638 <i>- I think this is about where we came in.<br />- Want to say a few words for the occasion?</i>
7794207 7795399 I'm sorry?
7795417 7797894 I still can't think of anything.
7799129 7801147 Ah. Flashback humor.
7806887 7809197 It's getting exciting now.
7810473 7814077 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
7815896 7820083 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7820150 7823211 One step closer to economic equilibrium.
7837918 7840729 - Why is she here?<br />- Tying up loose ends.
7841379 7844274 Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
7844883 7849328 - I beg you, please don't do this.<br />- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
7849346 7852449 - This is what we want.<br />- No. I don't want this.
7852515 7857370 Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.<br />We have to forget about you.
7858188 7861173 - You're a voice in my head.<br />- You're a voice in mine!
7861191 7864843 - Why can't I get rid of you?<br />- You need me.
7864861 7867262 No. I don't. I really don't anymore.
7867280 7871468 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make me feel better.
7871576 7874019 - Take some responsibility.<br />- I do.
7874037 7877606 I am responsible for all of it,<br />and I accept that.
7877624 7881311 So, please, I'm begging you,<br />please call this off.
7883713 7885774 Have I ever let us down?
7887342 7890153 How far have you come because of me?
7895517 7897668 I will bring us through this.
7897686 7901623 As always, I will carry you<br />kicking and screaming,
7901648 7904209 and in the end you will thank me.
7904359 7906961 Tyler. Tyler.
7906987 7910931 I'm grateful to you<br />for everything that you've done for me.
7910949 7913433 But this is too much. I don't want this.
7913451 7918313 What do you want? Your shit job back?<br />Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
7918331 7920475 Fuck you! I won't do it.
7921376 7925313 - This can't be happening.<br />- It's already done, so shut up!
7925797 7929400 - 60 seconds till CRI.<br />- No.
7931011 7934114 I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
7934347 7938284 You're not real. That gun...<br />That gun isn't even in your hand.
7939352 7941246 The gun's in my hand.
7947277 7950171 Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
7958288 7961182 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
7961750 7963768 Not my head, Tyler.
7963960 7965478 Our head.
7967505 7969023 Interesting.
7972385 7975405 Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
7981352 7984205 Hey. It's you and me.
7988068 7989502 Friends?
7990820 7992255 Tyler,
7995533 7998219 I want you to really listen to me.
7998787 7999929 Okay.
8001831 8003766 My eyes are open.
8021226 8023036 What's that smell?
8043665 8047101 - Where is everybody?<br />- Oh, no. What's going on?
8047502 8049103 Mr. Durden!
8049379 8050980 Oh, my God!
8051881 8053024 Sir!
8056386 8059656 Are you... Are you all right, sir?
8059973 8063785 - Oh, yeah, I'm okay.<br />- You look terrible, sir. What happened?
8064018 8067754 - Oh, nothing, it's no problem.<br />- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
8067772 8071501 - You look awful. You need assistance.<br />- I'm fine.
8071901 8074462 Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
8076447 8079391 Ow! Stop it!
8079409 8081970 - Let her go.<br />- Christ Almighty!
8082745 8084055 You!
8084747 8086182 Hi, Marla.
8087584 8091646 - Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.<br />- Are you sure?
8091754 8093523 Yes, I'm sure.
8095258 8099494 You fucker! What sick fucking game<br />are you playing at, putting me on a...
8099512 8101955 Oh, my God, your face!
8101973 8103574 Yeah, I know.
8108938 8111214 - What happened?<br />- Don't ask.
8111232 8113258 - You're shot.<br />- Yes, I'm shot.
8113276 8115211 Oh, my God.
8115236 8118673 - I can't believe he's standing.<br />- Tough motherfucker.
8122744 8124387 Who did this?
8124829 8126556 I did, actually.
8127165 8128975 Find some gauze.
8130501 8134863 - You shot yourself?<br />- Yes, but it's okay. Marla, look at me.
8134881 8136482 I'm really okay.
8137884 8140987 Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
8154234 8156919 You met me at<br />a very strange time in my life.
