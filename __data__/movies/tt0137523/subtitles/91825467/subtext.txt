38747 40158 (rock music)
121246 123487 (music fades)
125250 128117 (man) People always ask me<br />if I know Tyler Durden.
128545 130035 Three minutes.
130130 132588 This is it. Ground zero.
133216 135253 Want to say a few words for the occasion?
135344 136630 (mumbles)
136720 139838 With a gun barrel between your teeth,<br />you speak only in vowels.
139931 141592 I can't think of anything.
141683 145847 For a second, I forget about<br />Tyler's controlled demolition thing
145937 148053 and I wonder how clean that gun is.
148148 150105 It's getting exciting now.
150192 153310 That old saying,<br />how you always hurt the one you love,
153403 155394 well, it works both ways.
156114 159982 We have front-row seats<br />for this theater of mass destruction.
160077 162318 The Demolitions Committee<br />of Project Mayhem
162412 166997 wrapped the foundation columns<br />of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.
167084 169701 In two minutes,<br />primary charges will blow base charges
169795 173254 and a few blocks will be reduced<br />to smoldering rubble.
173757 176374 I know this because Tyler knows this.
176885 180378 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
180472 186013 Suddenly I realize that all of this -<br />the gun, the bombs, the revolution -
186103 189562 has got something to do<br />with a girl named Marla Singer.
191400 193767 Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
194903 198521 This was a support group<br />for men with testicular cancer.
198615 201949 The big moosie slobbering all over me,<br />that was Bob.
202411 203993 (flatly) We're still men.
204454 205990 Yes, we're men.
206498 208284 Men is what we are.
208375 212369 Bob had had his testicles removed.<br />Then hormone therapy.
213171 216038 <i>He developed bitch tits<br />'cause his testosterone was too high</i>
216133 218215 and his body upped the estrogen.
218301 222590 -That was where I fit.<br />-They'll have to drain my pecs again.
222681 224547 Between those huge, sweating tits
224641 228054 that hung enormous,<br />the way you'd think of God's as big.
228145 230307 OK, you cry now.
231648 234390 No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
235193 237651 For six months, I couldn't sleep.
237779 239941 (echoing) I couldn't sleep...
240574 242815 With insomnia, nothing's real.
243785 245651 Everything's far away.
245829 248070 Everything's a copy of a copy
248165 249576 of a copy.
253086 255077 When deep-space exploration ramps up,
255172 258164 it'll be the corporations<br />that name everything.
258383 260294 The IBM Stellar Sphere.
260844 262676 The Microsoft Galaxy.
263138 265049 The Planet Starbucks.
265557 268424 I need you out of town this week<br />to cover some red flags.
268518 272102 It must have been Tuesday.<br />He had on his cornflower-blue tie.
272189 276808 You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
276902 281442 Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.<br />Call me if there's any snags.
281531 285274 He was full of pep.<br />Must have had his grande latte enema.
287621 292411 Like so many others, I had become<br />a Slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
293043 297287 -I'd like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.<br />-(woman) Please hold.
297380 300122 If I saw something clever,<br />like a coffee table
300217 303209 in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.
304346 306678 The Klipsk personal office unit.
306765 309348 The Hovetrekke home exerbike.
309434 313143 Or the Ohamshab sofa<br />with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
313563 318057 Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of<br />environmentally friendly unbleached paper.
318568 320479 I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:
320570 323779 What kind of dining set<br />defines me as a person?
324741 329451 I had it all. Even the glass dishes<br />with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
329538 331654 proof that they were<br />crafted by the honest,
331748 334331 hard-working, indigenous peoples of...
334417 335782 -(woman) Please hold.<br />-...wherever.
338505 340371 We used to read pornography.
340465 342376 Now it was the Horchow collection.
342467 346756 -No. You can't die of insomnia.<br />-What about narcolepsy?
347305 351424 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.<br />I have no idea how I got there.
351518 355512 -You need to lighten up.<br />-Can you please just give me something?
355605 358643 Red and blue Tuinals,<br />lipstick-red Seconals...
359234 362522 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
363280 366568 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
369744 373738 -Hey, come on. I'm in pain.<br />-You wanna see pain?
373832 378622 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.<br />See the guys with testicular cancer.
379296 380832 That's pain.
388221 390929 (choir of children singing)
396479 400222 I always wanted three kids.<br />Two boys and a girl.
401109 403567 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
404154 406566 We never could agree on anything.
407908 411151 Well, she had her first child last week.
412120 413326 A girl.
414915 417327 With her... with her new husband.
421630 423587 And thank God. You know?
424257 425998 I-I'm glad for her.
427469 430803 (sobs) Because she deserves it.
434267 437680 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
437771 439432 (all) Thank you, Thomas.
439940 443228 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
443526 445563 And that gives me strength.
445654 447770 We give each other strength.
448073 449609 It's time for the one-on-ones.
449699 454364 So let's all of us follow Thomas's example<br />and really open ourselves up.
455205 457242 Could you find a partner?
459834 462417 And this is how I met the big moosie.
463880 466668 His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
469302 472465 Knees together.<br />Those awkward little steps.
478144 480101 -My name is Bob.<br />-Bob?
480981 483348 Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.
483441 486809 You know that chest expansion<br />program on late-night TV?
486903 488268 That was his idea.
488363 489899 (sobbing) I was a juicer.
490699 492781 You know - using steroids.
494244 497782 Diabonal and...Wisterol.
498289 501827 Oh, they use that on racehorses,<br />for Christ's sakes.
502877 506586 And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
508675 513511 my two grown Kids<br />won't even return my phone calls.
513596 514836 (sobs)
514931 519016 Strangers with this kind of honesty<br />make me go a big, rubbery one.
521813 523679 Go ahead... Cornelius.
524733 526189 You can cry.
530822 532529 (starts sniveling)
541124 544867 And then... something happened.<br />I let go.
544961 546702 That's really good.
547047 548754 Lost in oblivion.
549215 551456 Dark and silent and complete.
553887 555469 I found freedom.
556181 558468 Losing all hope was freedom.
560518 561849 (Bob whispers) It's OK.
565231 567438 Babies don't sleep this well.
570653 573145 I became addicted.
586920 591505 If I didn't say anything,<br />people always assumed the worst.
595512 597799 They cried harder...
597889 599129 then I cried harder.
607857 612067 Now we're going to open the green door,<br />the heart chakra...
612320 614277 I wasn't really dying.
614656 617523 I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
618159 621868 I was the warm little center<br />that the life of this world crowded around.
622705 626699 Imagine your pain<br />as a white ball of healing light.
627377 630711 It moves over your body, healing you.
631506 634294 Now keep this going.<br />Remember to breathe.
634592 637880 And step forward<br />through the back door of the room.
638888 640595 Where does it lead?
641057 642673 To your cave.
643351 646594 Step forward into your cave.
647564 649020 That's right.
649399 652687 You're going deeper into your cave,
653236 658072 (echoing) and you're going to find<br />your power animal.
660285 661650 (penguin) Slide.
663163 664870 (penguin giggles)
672505 674462 Every evening I died.
675633 678250 And every evening I was born again.
678928 680293 Resurrected.
683016 687180 Bob loved me because he thought<br />my testicles were removed too.
687270 691730 <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,<br />ready to cry.</i>
692317 694274 This was my vacation.
698114 701778 And she... ruined everything.
701868 703734 This is cancer, right?
706956 711291 This chick, Marla Singer,<br />did not have testicular cancer.
711878 713414 She was a liar.
713630 715962 She had no diseases at all.
716216 720084 I had seen her at Free And Clear,<br />my blood parasites group, Thursdays.
720178 723296 Then at Hope,<br />my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.
724265 728008 And again at Seize The Day,<br />my tuberculosis, Friday night.
731314 734147 Marla, the big tourist.
734817 737149 Her lie reflected my lie.
737320 739903 And suddenly, I felt nothing.
739989 744608 I couldn't cry.<br />So once again, I couldn't sleep.
757006 759498 Next group, after guided meditation,
759842 762960 after we open our heart chakras,<br />when it's time to hug,
763054 765921 I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer<br />and scream:
766015 770225 Marla, you liar!<br />You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!
771771 773887 I hadn't slept in four days.
774857 775972 (TV) We'll just let that dry...
776067 779276 (narrator) When you have insomnia,<br />you're never really asleep
779904 782145 and you're never really awake.
784450 788535 To begin tonight's communion,<br />Chloe would like to say a few words.
789664 791951 Oh, yeah. Chloe.
793167 795454 Chloe looked the way<br />Meryl Streep's skeleton would look
795545 799539 if you made it walk around a party<br />being extra nice to everybody.
800216 802002 Well, I'm still here.
802677 804884 But I don't know for how long.
805722 808760 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
809434 811550 But I've got some good news.
812145 814637 I no longer have any fear of death.
818484 822273 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
823364 825571 No one will have sex with me.
826784 827819 I'm so close to the end,
827910 831073 and all I want is to get laid for<br />the last time.
831914 834622 I have pornographic movies<br />in my apartment,
834709 838077 -and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />-Thank you, Chloe.
839172 841288 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
842759 844545 (all) Thank you, Chloe.
846471 850180 Now, let's ready ourself<br />for guided meditation.
852435 855473 You're standing at the entrance<br />of your cave.
855980 859189 You step inside your cave and you walk...
859442 862730 If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.
863946 865107 Marla.
865323 867314 The scratch on the roof of your mouth
867408 870867 that would heal if you could stop<br />tonguing it, but you can't.
870953 874321 (group leader)<br />...deeper into your cave as you walk.
875792 879126 (echoing) You feel<br />a healing energy all around you.
881214 883296 Now find your power animal.
887762 889002 Slide.
892892 895384 (group leader) OK. Let's partner up.
895978 898515 Pick someone special to you tonight.
904654 905735 Hey.
907073 908984 -We need to talk.<br />-Sure.
914372 916079 -I'm onto you.<br />-What?
916165 919157 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
920044 921079 Sorry?
921170 925755 In the Tibetan-philosophy,<br />Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
925842 929335 But you're not dying<br />the way Chloe back there is dying.
929679 930669 So?
931431 933172 So you're a tourist.
933641 937930 I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,<br />I saw you at tuberculosis.
938020 940057 I saw you at testicular cancer!
940148 942185 I saw you practicing this.
942358 944474 -Practicing what?<br />-Telling me off.
944569 947561 Is it going as well as you hoped...<br />"Rupert"?
949031 951864 -I'll expose you.<br />-Go ahead. I'll expose you.
951951 954864 (group leader)<br />Come together. Let yourselves cry.
960877 962333 (Marla sobs)
963045 964786 Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
964881 967293 It's cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.
967383 971092 Look, this is important.<br />These are my groups.
971179 973295 I've been coming for over a year.
973389 976381 -Why do you do it?<br />- don't know.
976476 980310 When people think you're dying,<br />they really listen to you instead of...
980396 983309 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
984567 986854 Yeah. Yeah.
987862 990445 Share yourself, completely.
991824 994486 You don't want to get into this.<br />It becomes an addiction.
994577 996818 -Really?<br />-I'm not kidding.
996913 1000326 I can't cry if another faker is present,<br />and I need this.
1000416 1002999 So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
1003085 1006168 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1009175 1011416 Wait a second. Hold on.
1012136 1015925 We'll split up the week, OK?<br />You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1016015 1018677 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1018768 1022181 Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1022271 1026310 Technically, I have more right to be there.<br />You still have your balls.
1026400 1028767 -You're kidding.<br />-I dunno. Am I?
1029111 1030317 No. No.
1030446 1033359 -What do you want?<br />-I'll take the parasites.
1033449 1036191 You can't have both.<br />Take the blood parasites.
1036285 1037867 I want brain parasites.
1037954 1040867 I'll take the blood,<br />but I want brain dementia.
1040957 1043540 -I want that.<br />-You can't have the whole brain.
1043626 1046209 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1046295 1049788 OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
1050383 1052420 Now we both have three...
1056097 1058634 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1058724 1060715 (tires screech)
1060810 1062392 (car horn)
1074740 1078734 -What, are you selling those?<br />-Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
1078828 1080910 So, we each have three. That's six.
1080997 1083409 What about the seventh day?<br />I want bowel cancer.
1083499 1085581 The girl had done her homework.
1085668 1090538 -No. No. I want bowel cancer.<br />-That's your favorite too?
1091048 1094666 -Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />-Look, we'll split it.
1095052 1098044 Take the first and third Sunday<br />of the month.
1100308 1101389 Deal.
1104145 1107763 -Looks like this is goodbye.<br />-Let's not make a big thing out of it.
1107857 1110474 How's this for not making a big thing?
1114989 1117105 Hey, Marla! Marla!
1119118 1122531 -Maybe we should exchange numbers.<br />-Should we?
1122788 1124995 We might wanna switch nights.
1126208 1127243 OK.
1132840 1135332 This is how I met Marla Singer.
1136844 1140553 Marla's philosophy of life<br />was that she might die at any moment.
1140640 1143177 The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.
1143267 1145634 It doesn't have your name!<br />Who are you?
1145728 1148971 Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?
1149065 1151978 Any of the stupid names<br />you give each night?
1154862 1156853 You wake up at SeaTac.
1157448 1159906 SFO. LAX.
1160993 1165408 You wake up at O'Hare.<br />Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.
1166123 1170333 Pacific. Mountain. Central.<br />Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
1170419 1173457 Check-in for that flight<br />isn't for another two hours.
1173547 1177165 This is your life,<br />and it's ending one minute at a time.
1177968 1181006 You wake up at Air Harbor International.
1181889 1185553 If you wake up at a different time,<br />in a different place,
1185976 1188764 could you wake up as a different person?
1189730 1192222 Everywhere I travel, tiny life.
1192983 1197602 Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream,<br />single pat of butter.
1198406 1201068 The microwave cordon bleu hobby Kit.
1201158 1206153 Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample<br />package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.
1208416 1212410 The people I meet on each flight,<br />they're single-serving friends.
1213796 1218586 Between takeoff and landing, we have<br />our time together, but that's all we get.
1219385 1220625 (TV) Welcome!
1222805 1224045 On a long-enough time line,
1224140 1227303 the survival rate for<br />everyone drops to zero.
1227393 1231102 I was a recall coordinator.<br />My job was to apply the formula.
1231188 1234271 The infant went through the windshield.<br />Three points.
1234358 1238443 A new car built by my company<br />leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.
1238529 1240816 The rear differential locks up.
1240906 1243773 The teenager's braces<br />are stuck to the ashtray.
1243868 1246075 Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
1246162 1249029 The car crashes and burns<br />with everyone trapped inside.
1249123 1251490 Now, should we initiate a recall?
1251834 1253245 The father must've been huge.
1253335 1257044 See where the fat burned to the seat?<br />The polyester shirt?
1257131 1258838 Very modern art.
1259133 1261875 Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.
1261969 1264586 Multiply it by the probable rate<br />of failure, B.
1264680 1268423 Multiply the result by<br />the average out-of-court settlement, C.
1268517 1270849 A times B times C...
1271061 1272301 equals X.
1272396 1276981 If X is less than the cost of a recall,<br />we don't do one.
1278486 1281103 Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
1281197 1283063 You wouldn't believe.
1284742 1287200 Which car company do you work for?
1288162 1289527 A major one.
1292208 1295667 Every time the plane banked too sharply<br />on takeoff or landing,
1295753 1299246 I prayed for a crash<br />or a mid-air collision.
1299340 1300626 Anything.
1310392 1314477 Life insurance pays off triple<br />if you die on a business trip.
1316816 1319729 "If you are seated<br />in an emergency exit row
1321195 1325940 "and feel unable or unwilling to perform<br />the duties listed on the safety card,
1326033 1329025 "please ask a flight attendant<br />to reseat you."
1330329 1334539 -It's a lot of responsibility.<br />-Wanna switch seats?
1334625 1338084 No. I'm not sure<br />I'm the man for that particular job.
1338170 1342255 An exit-door procedure<br />at 30,000 feet. Mm-hm.
1342925 1344791 The illusion of safety.
1345261 1346922 Yeah. I guess so.
1347805 1350638 You know why<br />they put oxygen masks on planes?
1350724 1354592 -So you can breathe.<br />-Oxygen gets you high.
1355646 1359264 In a catastrophic emergency,<br />you take giant panic breaths.
1359441 1363275 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.<br />You accept your fate.
1364780 1366737 It's all right here.
1367449 1370032 Emergency water landing, 600mph.
1370119 1373202 Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
1373789 1375450 That's, um...
1376333 1378870 That's an interesting theory.
1381088 1383625 -What do you do?<br />-What do you mean?
1383716 1385127 What do you do for a living?
1385217 1388175 Why? So you can pretend<br />you're interested?
1391432 1392422 OK.
1392516 1395725 You have a kind of<br />sick desperation in your laugh.
1398856 1401314 We have the exact same briefcase.
1402401 1403562 Soap.
1403652 1406861 -Sorry?<br />-I make and I sell soap.
1407573 1409860 The yardstick of civilization.
1410576 1412283 And this is how I met...
1412369 1413951 "Tyler Durden."”
1414413 1416245 Did you know if you mix gasoline
1416332 1419745 and frozen orange juice,<br />you can make napalm?
1419835 1422497 -No, I did not. Is that true?<br />-That's right.
1422588 1426172 One can make all kinds of explosives<br />using simple household items.
1426258 1428795 -Really?<br />-If one were so inclined.
1434016 1438886 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting<br />single-serving friend I've ever met.
1440564 1445024 -Everything on a plane is single-serving...<br />-Oh, I get it. Very clever.
1445402 1446733 Thank you.
1447613 1449604 How's that working out for you?
1449698 1451439 -What?<br />-Being clever.
1452993 1457203 -Great.<br />-Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
1458082 1459117 (sighs)
1459208 1460243 Now, a question of etiquette.
1460334 1463417 As I pass,<br />do I give you the ass or the crotch?
1470844 1473176 How I came to live with Tyler is...
1473263 1476551 Airlines have this policy<br />about vibrating luggage.
1484900 1486390 Was it ticking?
1486485 1489773 Throwers don't worry.<br />Modern bombs don't tick.
1489863 1492480 -Sorry. Throwers?<br />-Baggage handlers.
1493742 1497827 But when a suitcase vibrates,<br />the throwers have to call the police.
1497913 1500575 My suitcase was vibrating?
1500666 1505957 Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor,<br />but... every once in a while...
1509091 1510627 It's a dildo.
1511844 1515883 It's company policy never to imply<br />ownership in the event of a dildo.
1515973 1521844 We have to use the indefinite article -<br />"a dildo", never "your dildo".
1521937 1523644 I don't own...
1526859 1533652 I had everything in that suitcase.<br />My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.
1535367 1536903 Never mind.
1538996 1541613 (man outside) Hey! That's my car!
1543751 1545788 (sirens)
1548672 1551539 Home was a condo on<br />the 15th floor of a filing cabinet
1551633 1553920 for widows and young professionals.
1554011 1556002 The walls were solid concrete.
1556096 1559384 A foot of concrete's important<br />when your next-door neighbor
1559475 1562308 has to watch game shows at full volume.
1562394 1566683 Or when a blast of debris<br />that used to be your personal effects
1566774 1570563 blows out of your windows<br />and sails flaming into the night.
1570652 1572359 (helicopter hovering)
1576950 1579408 I suppose these things happen.
1588170 1590832 (sirens)
1592216 1594332 There's... nothing up there.
1594426 1597669 You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
1606480 1608972 Do you have somebody you can call?
1609733 1614148 How embarrassing.<br />A houseful of condiments and no food.
1624206 1626197 The police later told me the pilot light
1626291 1630159 might have gone out,<br />letting out a little bit of gas.
1631213 1633796 That gas could have<br />slowly filled the condo -
1633882 1636294 1700 square feet with high ceilings -
1636385 1638296 for days and days.
1645561 1649395 Then the refrigerator's compressor<br />could have clicked on.
1651275 1652436 (Marla) Yeah?
1655404 1657771 (Marla) I can hear you breathing, you...
1667416 1670954 If you ask me now,<br />I couldn't tell you why I called him.
1678635 1680501 (ringing tone)
1692274 1693810 (engine starts)
1700782 1702318 (phone rings)
1713587 1715328 -Hello?<br />-(Tyler) Who's this?
1715464 1716954 (Tyler munching)
1717549 1720086 -Tyler?<br />-Who is this?
1720177 1721417 Um...
1721762 1724049 We met... We met on the airplane.
1724139 1726130 We had the same suitcase?
1726725 1730434 -Uh... the clever guy.<br />-(laughs) Oh, yeah. Right.
1732731 1736599 I called a second ago.<br />There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
1736693 1739606 Yeah, I redialed you.<br />I never pick up my phone.
1739696 1741278 (munching continues)
1742324 1744156 -So what's up?<br />-Uh...
1745202 1746488 Well...
1747329 1748990 You're not gonna believe this.
1752084 1753700 (Tyler) It could be worse.
1753794 1758288 A woman could cut off your penis<br />while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
1758757 1760623 There's always that.
1761009 1763842 It's just, when you buy furniture,<br />you tell yourself:
1764137 1766344 That's the last sofa I'll need.
1766431 1770220 Whatever else happens,<br />I've got that sofa problem handled.
1770310 1773519 I had it all.<br />I had a stereo that was very decent.
1773730 1776267 A wardrobe that was<br />getting very respectable.
1776358 1779020 I was close to being complete.
1779111 1782194 -Shit, man. And now it's all gone.<br />-All gone.
1783073 1784529 All gone.
1786576 1788738 Do you know what a duvet is?
1789329 1792321 -A comforter.<br />-It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
1792874 1795286 Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?
1795377 1799541 Is this essential to our survival<br />in the hunter-gatherer sense?
1799798 1800959 No.
1801591 1805755 -What are we, then?<br />-I dunno. Consumers.
1806054 1808045 Right. We're consumers.
1808265 1811223 We are by-products of<br />a lifestyle obsession.
1812185 1815644 Murder, crime, poverty.<br />These things don't concern me.
1815731 1818564 What concerns me<br />are celebrity magazines,
1819067 1821434 television with 500 channels,
1821528 1823144 some guy's name on my underwear.
1823238 1825821 Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
1825907 1828524 -Martha Stewart.<br />-Fuck Martha Stewart.
1829077 1832615 She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.<br />It's all going down.
1832706 1836916 So fuck off with your sofa units<br />and Strinne green stripe patterns.
1837169 1839456 I say never be complete.
1839546 1841628 I say stop being perfect.
1841923 1843914 I say let's evolve.
1844301 1846759 Let the chips fall where they may.
1848764 1852678 But that's me, and I could be wrong.<br />Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
1852768 1856011 It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.
1856104 1859597 You did lose a lot of versatile solutions<br />for modern living.
1859691 1862353 Fuck, you're right.<br />No, I don't smoke.
1865781 1868819 My insurance is probably<br />gonna cover it, so...
1872454 1876743 -What?<br />-The things you own end up owning you.
1880170 1882332 But do what you like, man.
1883006 1884212 (sighs)
1884299 1885835 Oh, it's late.
1886468 1889130 -Hey, thanks for the beer.<br />-Yeah, man.
1889346 1891212 I should find a hotel.
1891515 1892846 -On!<br />-What?
1893975 1895010 What?
1895102 1896638 -A hotel?<br />-Yeah.
1897062 1899929 -Just ask, man.<br />-What are you talking about?
1900023 1903561 Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer<br />and you still can't ask.
1906655 1907611 -What?<br />-You called me
1907697 1909608 'cause you need a place to stay.
1909699 1913192 -Oh, hey. No, no, no.<br />-Yes, you did. So just ask.
1913286 1915823 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
1917666 1919828 Would... Would that be a problem?
1919918 1922205 Is it a problem for you to ask?
1923130 1925462 -Can I stay at your place?<br />-Yeah.
1927175 1928336 Thanks.
1932889 1935756 - Want you to do me a favor.<br />-Yeah, sure.
1936017 1938759 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1939271 1943856 -What?<br />-I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1944776 1946892 Let me tell you a little about Tyler Durden.
1948196 1952190 Tyler was a night person.<br />While the rest of us slept, he worked.
1952284 1955117 He had one part-time job<br />as a projectionist.
1955203 1958696 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.<br />It comes on a few.
1958790 1962158 So someone has to switch the projectors<br />at the exact moment
1962252 1964744 that one reel ends<br />and the next one begins.
1964838 1969799 If you look, you can see little dots come<br />into the upper right corner of the screen.
1969885 1972718 In the industry,<br />we call them cigarette burns.
1972804 1974511 That's the cue for a changeover.
1974598 1979388 He flips the projectors, movie keeps<br />going and the audience has no idea.
1979728 1982220 Why would anyone want this shit job?
1982314 1985102 "Cause it affords him<br />interesting opportunities.
1985192 1988150 Like splicing a frame of pornography<br />into family films.
1988236 1990819 So when the snooty cat<br />and the courageous dog
1990906 1994149 with the celebrity voices first meet,
1994242 1997951 you'll catch a flash<br />of Tyler's contribution to the film.
1998038 1999745 (musical number)
2005420 2007661 Nobody knows<br />that they saw it but they did.
2007756 2009747 Nice big cock.
2013011 2014297 (cries)
2014930 2017592 Even a hummingbird<br />couldn't catch Tyler at work.
2023063 2027808 Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet<br />waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
2032948 2036657 He was the guerrilla terrorist<br />of the food service industry.
2037118 2039280 Do not watch.<br />I cannot go when you watch.
2039371 2041203 Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
2041289 2043906 he farted on meringues,<br />sneezed on endives...
2044000 2046617 As for the cream of mushroom soup...
2046711 2050124 -(sniggers) Go ahead, tell 'em.<br />-You get the idea.
2050549 2053883 -You just want me to hit you?<br />-Come on. Do me this one favor.
2053969 2057212 -Why?<br />-I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
2057305 2061549 -No. But that's a good thing.<br />-You can't know yourself if you haven't.
2061893 2064055 I don't wanna die without any scars.
2064145 2068355 -Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.<br />-Oh, God. This is crazy.
2068441 2070398 So go crazy! Let it rip.
2070860 2073727 -I don't know about this.<br />- I don't either.
2073822 2076735 Who gives a shit? No one's watching.<br />What do you care?
2076825 2079157 This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
2079244 2080734 That's right.
2081371 2084329 -Where? Like, in the face?<br />-Surprise me.
2086751 2088788 This is so fucking stupid.
2099472 2103932 Motherfucker!<br />You hit me in the ear!
2104019 2107182 -Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.<br />-Ow! Christ!
2107689 2108929 Why the ear, man?
2109024 2111482 -I fucked it up.<br />-No, that was perfect.
2111568 2113150 Ugh! Agh!
2124205 2126196 (winded) No, it's all right.
2127584 2129416 It really hurts.
2129711 2130872 Right.
2132130 2136499 -Hit me again.<br />-No, you hit me. Come on!
2139054 2140670 (shouting)
2153443 2155935 We should do this again sometime.
2168667 2170783 -Where's your car?<br />-What car?
2171252 2172413 (Tyler belches)
2181930 2186174 I don't know how Tyler found that house,<br />but he said he'd been there for a year.
2186267 2189430 It looked like it was<br />waiting to be torn down.
2189521 2191888 Most of the windows were boarded up.
2191981 2193471 There was no lock on the front door
2193566 2196649 from when the police,<br />or whoever, kicked it in.
2196861 2199353 The stairs were ready to collapse.
2199447 2202280 I didn't know if he owned it<br />or was squatting.
2202367 2204859 Neither would have surprised me.
2205203 2206785 Yep. That's you.
2207622 2210080 That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
2210166 2211622 Yeah, thanks.
2212961 2214577 What a shithole.
2215797 2217458 Nothing worked.
2218383 2219965 (banging)
2220427 2224216 Turning on one light meant<br />another light in the house went out.
2224305 2227593 There were no neighbors.<br />Just warehouses and a paper mill.
2227684 2231598 That fart smell of steam.<br />The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.
2233606 2235597 Hey. What have we here?
2250874 2252490 -Hey, guys.<br />-Hey.
2264554 2267717 Every time it rained,<br />we had to kill the power.
2267807 2271266 By the end of the first month,<br />I didn't miss TV.
2272437 2275930 I didn't even mind the warm,<br />stale refrigerator.
2288870 2290531 Can I be next?
2294876 2296366 All right, man.
2296461 2297917 Lose the tie.
2300215 2301455 (glass smashes)
2301549 2302584 (laughing)
2302675 2306839 At night, Tyler and I were alone<br />for half a mile in every direction.
2308598 2309588 (crash)
2310141 2311723 (dog barking)
2312894 2316387 Rain trickled down through<br />the plaster and the light fixtures.
2316481 2319098 Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
2319192 2322435 Everywhere were rusted nails<br />to snag your elbow on.
2322987 2326196 The previous occupant<br />had been a bit of a shut-in.
2326282 2328523 -What are you reading?<br />-Listen to this.
2328618 2332077 It's an article written<br />by an organ in the first person.
2332163 2334495 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
2334582 2336323 "Without me, Jack could not regulate
2336417 2339034 "his heart rate,<br />blood pressure or breathing."
2339128 2341244 There's a whole series of these.
2341339 2345674 "I Am Jill's Nipples."<br />"I Am Jack's Colon."
2345760 2348343 (laughs) Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
2350098 2352009 Whoop! Agh!
2352100 2356264 After fighting, everything else in life<br />got the volume turned down.
2356396 2358637 (inaudible)
2358731 2359687 What?
2359774 2363768 -You could deal with anything.<br />-Have you finished those reports?
2368449 2370281 (Tyler) If you could choose,<br />who would you fight?
2371160 2373197 I'd fight my boss, probably.
2373288 2374449 Really?
2375456 2378790 -Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?<br />-I'd fight my dad.
2379127 2380868 I don't know my dad.
2380962 2384626 I mean, I know him, but he left<br />when I was, like, six years old.
2384716 2387253 Married this other woman<br />and had some other kids.
2387343 2389209 He did this every six years.
2389304 2393969 -He moves city and starts a new family.<br />-Fucker's setting up franchises.
2395852 2399720 My dad never went to college,<br />so it was real important that I go.
2399814 2401225 That sounds familiar.
2401316 2405150 So I graduate. I call him up long distance<br />and say, "Dad, now what?"
2405236 2407398 -He says, "Get a job."<br />-Same here.
2407488 2412153 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.<br />"Dad, now what?"
2412368 2414700 He says, "I dunno. Get married."
2416956 2418822 You can't get married.
2419250 2421116 I'm a 30-year-old boy.
2421377 2424460 We're a generation of men<br />raised by women.
2424547 2428336 I'm wondering if another woman<br />is really the answer we need.
2434140 2437349 Most of the week,<br />we were Ozzie and Harriet.
2438686 2442224 But every Saturday night,<br />we were finding something out.
2443149 2446687 We were finding out more and more<br />that we were not alone.
2450531 2454650 It used to be that when I came home angry<br />or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.
2454744 2457156 Polish my Scandinavian furniture.
2457455 2459787 I should have been<br />looking for a new condo,
2459874 2462457 haggling with my insurance company.
2462543 2467333 I should have been upset about my nice<br />flaming little shit - but I wasn't.
2467674 2471542 The premise of cybernetting any office<br />is make things more efficient.
2471636 2474879 Monday mornings,<br />all I thought about was next week.
2474973 2477840 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
2477934 2479424 Absolutely.
2479727 2482219 Efficiency is priority number one, people.
2482563 2484850 Because waste is a thief.
2485650 2489234 I showed this to my man here.<br />You liked it, didn't you?
2492740 2496028 You can swallow a pint of blood<br />before you get sick.
2497662 2501747 It was right in everyone's face.<br />Tyler and I just made it visible.
2501916 2506581 It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.<br />Tyler and I just gave it a name.
2506796 2508378 (rock music)
2517598 2520431 Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
2541914 2544451 Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
2566272 2569731 Every week, Tyler gave the rules<br />that he and I decided.
2569817 2571307 Gentlemen!
2571903 2573860 Welcome to Fight Club.
2576407 2580401 The first rule of Fight Club is<br />you do not talk about Fight Club.
2581162 2583654 The second rule of Fight Club is...
2583831 2586619 you do not talk about Fight Club!
2587668 2589079 Third rule of Fight Club:
2589170 2592663 someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
2592757 2594418 the fight is over.
2594801 2597418 Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
2598137 2600925 Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
2601015 2602255 (laughter)
2602350 2604967 Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
2605353 2609392 Seventh rule: fights will go on<br />as long as they have to.
2611818 2617234 And the eighth and final rule: if this is<br />your first night at Fight Club,
2618282 2619443 you have to fight.
2619534 2621650 (shouting and cheering)
2624330 2626071 This kid from work, Ricky,
2626165 2630454 couldn't remember whether<br />you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
2631712 2633623 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
2633714 2637332 when he trounced<br />the maître d' of a local food court.
2639554 2641170 Sometimes,<br />all you could hear were the flat,
2641264 2644222 hard, packing sounds over the yelling.
2647770 2650933 Or the wet choke<br />when someone gasped and sprayed...
2651023 2652229 Stop!
2652775 2655437 You weren't alive anywhere<br />like you were there.
2655528 2660523 But Fight Club only exists in the hours<br />between when Fight Club starts and ends.
2661450 2663817 Even if I could tell someone<br />they had a good fight,
2663911 2666278 I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
2666372 2667703 Who you were in Fight Club
2667790 2670657 is not who you were<br />in the rest of the world.
2670751 2675086 A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.<br />His ass was a wad of cookie dough.
2675173 2678416 After a few weeks,<br />he was carved out of wood.
2679093 2682006 If you could fight any celebrity,<br />who would you fight?
2682096 2685214 -Alive or dead?<br />-Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2686309 2688596 Hemingway. You?
2690062 2693100 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2695026 2697814 We all started seeing things differently.
2698529 2701897 Everywhere we went,<br />we were sizing things up.
2705953 2708490 I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,
2708581 2712620 trying to look like how Calvin Klein<br />or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
2712710 2715122 Is that what a man looks like?
2715588 2718296 Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
2718716 2720923 Now, self-destruction...
2721010 2722421 Excuse me.
2722929 2724465 (man roars)
2725097 2726804 (cheering)
2749664 2751530 (cheering)
2757588 2760171 Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
2760258 2762215 It wasn't about words.
2764845 2769635 The hysterical shouting was in tongues,<br />like at a Pentecostal Church.
2774730 2776516 -Is that it?<br />-Stop!
2776983 2779941 When the fight was over,<br />nothing was solved.
2780361 2782022 But nothing mattered.
2782113 2783194 Cool.
2785574 2788066 Afterwards, we all felt saved.
2788160 2790572 Hey, man. How about next week?
2791664 2793575 How about next month?
2793916 2796999 Irvine, you're in the middle.<br />New guy, you too.
2799547 2801458 Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
2801549 2803540 He fell down some stairs.
2804176 2806258 I fell down some stairs.
2808431 2812800 Fight Club became the reason to cut<br />your hair short or trim your fingernails.
2812893 2814884 OK. Any historical figure.
2815980 2819644 -I'd fight Gandhi.<br />-Good answer.
2820609 2822566 -How about you?<br />-Lincoln.
2822945 2824561 -Lincoln?<br />-Mm-hm.
2825197 2828815 Big guy, big reach.<br />Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
2829201 2830282 Fuck!
2832705 2835447 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
2839295 2840785 (ringing)
2844383 2845373 Hello?
2845468 2848301 Where have you been<br />the last eight weeks?
2848387 2849627 Marla?
2849764 2850754 (Tyler yells)
2853017 2856100 -How did you find me?<br />-You left a forwarding number.
2856187 2858975 I haven't seen you at any support groups.
2859106 2862019 We split 'em up.<br />That was the idea. Remember?
2862485 2865318 Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
2865529 2867770 -How do you know?<br />-I cheated.
2869367 2871028 I found a new one.
2871327 2873443 -Really?<br />-It's for men only.
2873662 2875244 Like the testicle thing?
2875331 2876787 (Tyler) Whah!
2879752 2883336 -Look, this is a bad time.<br />-I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
2883422 2886380 -Some really fucked-up people.<br />-I'm on my way out.
2886467 2889255 Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
2889637 2893631 I took what was left of a bottle.<br />It might have been too much.
2893724 2897718 Picture Marla Singer throwing herself<br />around her crummy apartment.
2897812 2901646 This isn't a for-real suicide.<br />It's probably a cry for help.
2902233 2903815 This could go on for hours.
2903901 2908065 -So you're staying in tonight?<br />-Do you wanna hear me describe death?
2908989 2913074 Do you wanna listen<br />and see if my spirit can use a phone?
2915246 2917328 Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
2943691 2945773 Tyler's door was closed.
2945860 2949023 I'd been here for two months<br />and his door was never closed.
2951157 2952989 (footsteps on stairs)
2955035 2957447 You won't believe the dream<br />I had last night.
2957538 2960576 I can hardly believe<br />anything from last night.
2966005 2967370 (gargles)
2969049 2970380 (giggles)
2970551 2972508 What are you doing here?
2976390 2977846 -What?<br />-This is my house.
2977933 2979924 What are you doing here?
2982062 2983348 Fuck you!
2983898 2984888 (drops glass)
2996076 2997487 (Tyler laughs)
2998537 3001620 Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
3002875 3005583 Limber, though. Silly cooze.
3007630 3011544 I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.<br />Guess who's on the other end.
3011634 3014126 I knew the story before he told me.
3017598 3020716 (Marla) Have you ever heard<br />a death rattle before?
3020809 3023767 Do you think it'll live up to its name?
3023854 3026721 Or will it just be a death hairball?
3026941 3028431 (coughs)
3030027 3033486 Prepare to evacuate soul.
3034114 3038779 (Marla) Ten, nine, eight...
3038953 3042116 (narrator) How could Tyler, of all people,<br />think it was a bad thing
3042206 3044789 that Marla Singer was about to die?
3045251 3049961 (Marla) ...five, four, three...
3050256 3051667 Hang on.
3056720 3058802 You got here fast.
3061308 3062844 Did I call you?
3064270 3065305 Huh?
3073654 3076772 The mattress is all sealed<br />in slippery plastic.
3079410 3082072 Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
3082162 3083994 (approaching sirens)
3085457 3089121 Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
3096176 3097712 (shouting)
3101265 3104178 -Hey, where's 5137<br />-End of the hall.
3105603 3109096 The girl who lives there<br />used to be a charming, lovely girl.
3109189 3111305 She has lost faith in herself.
3111400 3114142 -Miss Singer, let us help you!<br />-She's a monster!
3114236 3118446 -You have every reason to live.<br />-She's infectious human waste!
3118532 3121445 -(officer) Miss Singer!<br />-Good luck trying to save her!
3127875 3131368 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
3133088 3135546 You're gonna have to keep me up...
3136050 3137711 all night.
3138135 3140046 Un-fucking-believable.
3140554 3142386 He was obviously able to handle it.
3142473 3145841 -You know what I mean. You fucked her.<br />-No, I didn't.
3147394 3148725 -Never?<br />-No.
3150481 3153769 -You're not into her, are you?<br />-No! God, not at all.
3154151 3156313 I am Jack's raging bile duct.
3156403 3159987 -Are you sure? You can tell me.<br />-Believe me, I'm sure.
3160074 3161314 Put a gun to my head
3161408 3163649 -and spray my brains.<br />-That's good.
3163744 3166953 She's a predator posing as a house pet.<br />Stay away.
3169917 3172659 The shit that came out of<br />this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
3172753 3173914 My God.
3174296 3177584 I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.
3177841 3180549 -Euch!<br />-How could Tyler not go for that?
3180636 3183970 The other night, he was splicing<br />sex organs into "Cinderella”.
3184056 3186388 Marla doesn't need a lover,<br />just a caseworker.
3186475 3189593 And a wash.<br />This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
3190062 3193054 She invaded my support groups<br />and now my home.
3193148 3194889 Hey, hey. Sit down.
3199363 3203231 -I can't have you talking to her about me.<br />-Why would I talk to her?
3203325 3205111 You say anything about me<br />or what goes on
3205202 3208490 in this house to her or anybody,<br />we're done.
3209331 3211117 -Now promise me.<br />-OK.
3211625 3213207 -You promise?<br />- I promise.
3213293 3216126 -Promise.<br />- I just said, I promise! What...
3216213 3218545 That's three times you promised.
3219758 3223922 If only I had wasted a couple of minutes<br />and gone to watch Marla Singer die,
3224012 3226299 none of this would've happened.
3226974 3229136 (Marla moans with excitement)
3229476 3230591 (thudding)
3230686 3233018 (Marla) Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
3234148 3235980 (Marla squeals)
3237860 3239521 (thudding)
3241071 3243688 I could have moved to another room.
3243782 3247650 On the third floor<br />where I might not have heard them.
3248245 3249701 But I didn't.
3255294 3258332 (Marla moans ecstatically)
3267556 3269046 (rumbling)
3270476 3271466 (Tyler) Ow!
3274104 3277096 -What are you doing?<br />-Just going to bed.
3278734 3281442 -You wanna finish her off?<br />-(Marla) Ooh!
3282905 3285943 -No. No, thank you.<br />-(Marla) I found a cigarette.
3287576 3289567 -Who were you talking to?<br />-Shut up.
3289661 3290776 (Marla moaning)
3290871 3294034 I became the calm<br />little center of the world.
3294124 3295956 I was the Zen master.
3301256 3303372 I wrote little haiku poems.
3304051 3306258 I emailed them to everyone.
3307179 3308886 Is that your blood?
3311058 3312264 Some of it, yeah.
3312351 3313807 You can't smoke in here.
3313894 3314884 (scoffs)
3316188 3319806 Take the rest of the day off.<br />Come back Monday with clean clothes.
3319900 3321686 Get yourself together.
3321777 3326692 I got right in everyone's hostile face.<br />"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."
3326949 3330567 "Yes, I'm comfortable with that.<br />I am enlightened.”
3333163 3337578 You give up the condo life and<br />all your flaming worldly possessions,
3338001 3341790 go live in a dilapidated house<br />in a toxic-waste part of town,
3341880 3344087 ...and you have to come home to this.
3344174 3345915 (shouting and thudding)
3346426 3347757 (phone rings)
3347845 3351634 (Tyler and Marla shriek)
3355853 3356843 Hello?
3356937 3360020 This is Detective Stern<br />with the Arson Unit.
3360566 3364525 We have new information about<br />the incident at your former condo.
3364611 3366397 -Yes?<br />- I don't know if you're aware,
3366488 3370527 but someone sprayed Freon<br />into your front-door lock.
3370617 3373530 They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
3373620 3377033 -No, I wasn't aware of that.<br />-(narrator) I am Jack's cold sweat.
3377457 3381451 -Does this sound strange to you?<br />-(Stern) Yes, sir. Very strange.
3382004 3383540 -The dynamite...<br />-Dynamite?
3383630 3387669 ...left a residue of<br />ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
3388218 3391586 -Do you know what this means?<br />-No. What does it mean?
3391805 3393796 It means it was home-made.
3394600 3397513 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3397603 3400561 Whoever set this dynamite<br />could have blown out
3400647 3403560 your pilot light days before the explosion.
3403650 3406483 -The gas was just a detonator.<br />-Who'd do such a thing?
3406570 3408982 -I'll ask the questions.<br />-Tell him.
3409489 3413323 “The liberator who destroyed my property<br />realigned my perceptions."
3413410 3414866 Excuse me. Are you there?
3414953 3418446 Yes. It's hard to know<br />what to make of this.
3418540 3420577 Have you recently made enemies
3420667 3422874 who might have access<br />to home-made dynamite?
3422961 3425544 -Enemies?<br />-"I reject civilization,
3425631 3427622 especially material possessions."
3427716 3430333 -Son, this is serious.<br />-Yes, I know it's serious.
3430427 3433260 -I mean that.<br />-Yes, it's very serious.
3433347 3439138 Look, nobody takes this more seriously<br />than me. That condo was my life. OK?
3439686 3442394 I loved every stick of<br />furniture in that place.
3442481 3445690 That was not just a bunch of stuff<br />that got destroyed.
3445776 3448268 -It was me!<br />-(narrator) I thank the Academy.
3448362 3452606 -Is this not a good time for you?<br />-Just tell him you fucking did it!
3452866 3456951 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3457037 3460905 -Are you still there?<br />-Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
3460999 3465664 No. I may need to talk to you, so you<br />let me know if you're gonna leave town.
3466463 3467874 -OK?<br />-OK.
3471510 3472625 Except for their humping,
3472719 3475552 Tyler and Marla were never<br />in the same room.
3475639 3478301 My parents pulled<br />this exact same act for years.
3478392 3481760 The condom is the glass slipper<br />of our generation.
3482729 3485562 You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
3485732 3489441 You dance all night,<br />then you throw it away.
3490445 3493187 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3494574 3495655 What?
3500497 3503330 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
3503417 3505203 It was worth every penny.
3505293 3507330 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3509381 3513340 Someone loved it intensely for one day,
3514553 3516135 then tossed it.
3517764 3519596 Like a Christmas tree.
3520142 3521678 So special.
3522978 3524935 Then... bam!
3525814 3528021 It's on the side of the road.
3528567 3530683 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3532654 3539447 Like a sex-crime victim, underwear<br />inside out, bound with electrical tape.
3539953 3541944 Well, then, it suits you.
3542456 3544572 You can borrow it sometime.
3551798 3553288 Get rid of her.
3554134 3556717 -What? You get rid of her!<br />-Don't mention me.
3556803 3561013 I am six years old again,<br />passing messages between parents.
3564394 3567136 -It's time you left.<br />-Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3567230 3572100 -Not that we don't love your visits.<br />-You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
3573904 3576396 Gotta get off
3576490 3577480 Thanks. Bye.
3577574 3582819 Gotta get off of this merry-go-round
3584706 3589325 Gonna get, need to get, gotta get...
3590879 3592836 (Tyler sniggers)
3593006 3594246 You kids!
3595717 3598425 Why do you still waste time with her?
3599846 3602964 I'll say this about Marla.<br />At least she's trying to hit bottom.
3603058 3604469 And I'm not?
3604810 3608519 Sticking feathers up your butt<br />does not make you a chicken.
3608855 3610721 What are we doing tonight?
3610816 3612853 Tonight... we make soap.
3613985 3617228 -Really?<br />-To make soap, first we render fat.
3637551 3638962 The salt balance has to be just right,
3639052 3642135 so the best fat for soap<br />comes from humans.
3642889 3646052 -Wait. What is this place?<br />-A liposuction clinic.
3653942 3655683 Aha! Pay dirt!
3656570 3660404 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />The fat of the land!
3666079 3668912 No! Don't pull it.
3673628 3676040 -Oh, God!<br />-Give me another one.
3683388 3687803 As the fat renders, the tallows float<br />to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
3688185 3691769 -It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.<br />-Keep stirring.
3694149 3697687 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerin.
3697777 3700018 Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
3700113 3704323 If you then add sodium nitrate<br />and sawdust, you got dynamite.
3705327 3708069 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
3708163 3710825 Tyler was full of useful information.
3710916 3714500 Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner<br />when washed in one part of the river.
3714586 3715917 -You know why?<br />-No.
3720050 3722883 Humans were once sacrificed<br />on the hills above.
3722969 3726678 Bodies burned, water seeped<br />through the ashes to create lye.
3727224 3729215 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3729309 3733849 Once it mixed with the melted body fat,<br />a soapy discharge crept into the river.
3733939 3736226 May I see your hand, please?
3741363 3742649 (kisses)
3743281 3744612 What is this?
3744699 3747487 -This is a chemical burn.<br />-Agh! Aaagh!
3747577 3750911 It'll hurt more than you've ever<br />been burned and leave a scar.
3750997 3753489 If meditation worked for cancer,<br />it could work for this.
3754167 3756579 -Don't shut the pain out.<br />-Oh, God!
3758588 3760545 The first soap was made<br />from heroes' ashes,
3760632 3762418 like the first monkey shot into space.
3762509 3765627 Without pain or sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3765720 3768462 I tried not to think<br />of the words "searing" or "flesh”.
3768556 3771469 Stop it! This is your pain,<br />this is your burning hand.
3771559 3774642 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3774729 3778393 No! Don't deal with this<br />the way those dead people do! Come on!
3778483 3779473 -I get the point!<br />-No!
3779567 3781854 You're feeling premature enlightenment.
3786366 3789154 It's the greatest moment of your life,<br />and you're missing it!
3789244 3790780 I am not...
3791371 3794284 Shut up! Our fathers<br />were our models for God.
3794374 3797241 If our fathers bailed,<br />what does that tell you about God?
3798712 3804048 Listen to me. You have to consider<br />the possibility that God does not like you.
3804175 3807793 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, he hates you.
3807887 3811300 This is not the worst thing<br />that can happen. We don't need him!
3811391 3814554 -I agree!<br />-Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
3814644 3817136 We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
3817230 3821189 -I'm getting water!<br />-You can use water and make it worse or...
3821276 3822812 Look at me!
3822902 3826020 -Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />-Please let me have it, please!
3826114 3828355 First, you have to give up.
3828742 3831234 First, you have to know - not fear -
3831494 3834361 know that someday, you're gonna die.
3834456 3836743 You don't know how this feels!
3841629 3845668 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3846426 3847507 OK.
3847594 3848584 (whimpers)
3863109 3866727 Congratulations.<br />You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
3869866 3873530 Tyler sold his soap to department stores<br />at $20 a bar.
3873620 3875110 God knows what they charged.
3875205 3879039 -This is the best soap.<br />-Why, thank you, Susan.
3879459 3880995 It was beautiful.
3881086 3884795 We were selling rich women<br />their own fat asses back to them.
3886341 3888378 He was wearing his yellow tie.
3888468 3890675 I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.
3890804 3894547 "The first rule of Fight Club<br />is don't talk about Fight Club"?
3894641 3897929 I'm half-asleep again.<br />I must have left it in the copy machine.
3898019 3900511 "The second rule..." Is this yours?
3901064 3902395 Huh?
3902482 3905565 Pretend you're me.<br />Make a managerial decision.
3905652 3908064 You find this. What would you do?
3913034 3914945 Well, I gotta tell you,
3915120 3918408 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3918498 3921957 Because the person who wrote that<br />is dangerous.
3922043 3926503 And this button-down,<br />Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap
3926589 3929456 and then stalk from office to office
3929551 3934967 with an Armalite AR10 carbine<br />gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
3935056 3938674 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3940353 3943311 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.
3943398 3946641 Someone very, very close to you.
3947485 3950352 Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
3951614 3953525 And I used to be such a nice guy.
3953616 3956984 Or maybe you shouldn't bring me<br />every piece of trash you pick up.
3957078 3958739 (phone rings)
3960707 3963540 -Compliance and Liability.<br />-My tit's gonna rot off.
3965879 3968587 Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
3974179 3975214 What do you mean?
3975305 3978297 I need you to check<br />for a lump in my breast.
3978391 3982225 -Go to a hospital.<br />-I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
3982937 3985224 I don't know about this, Marla.
3985398 3986809 Please?
3986900 3990063 She didn't call Tyler.<br />I'm neutral in her book.
3992530 3996615 That's nice. Taking food to...<br />Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
3996868 3998654 Where are they, exactly?
3998745 4003330 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4003416 4005248 -No, no.<br />- I got one for you.
4005335 4007246 Thanks for the thought.
4008588 4010704 What happened to your hand?
4011216 4012581 Oh, nothing.
4014052 4015668 -Right there?<br />-Mm.
4016596 4019008 -Feel anything?<br />-No.
4019140 4020756 Well, make sure.
4022143 4025261 -OK, I'm pretty sure.<br />-You feel nothing?
4026439 4027850 No, nothing.
4029609 4032101 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
4033863 4037026 -No problem.<br />-I wish I could return the favor.
4037116 4039483 Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
4039577 4042319 -I could check your prostate.<br />- I think I'm OK.
4043289 4045121 Well, thanks, anyway.
4050004 4052371 -Are we done?<br />-Yeah, we're done.
4052465 4054672 See you... around.
4071818 4073775 (man) Cornelius?
4073861 4076444 Cornelius!
4076531 4078898 It's me! Bob!
4078992 4080482 Hey, Bob.
4084455 4087573 -We all thought you were dead.<br />-No, no. Still here.
4087667 4089578 How are you, Bob?
4089669 4091376 Better than I've ever been in my whole life.
4091462 4094375 Really? Still Remaining Men Together?
4094507 4096544 No, no.<br />I got something so much better now.
4096634 4099376 Really, what is it?
4099470 4101336 Well...
4101431 4105220 The first rule is,<br />I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4106436 4107972 And the second rule is...
4108062 4109723 I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4109814 4113478 -And the third rule is...<br />-Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
4114360 4116351 Look at my face, Bob.
4118364 4120651 That's fucking great.
4120742 4123985 -I've never seen you there.<br />-I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4125038 4128201 - I go Saturday.<br />-Congratulations.
4129000 4130786 Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?
4130877 4133915 Have you heard about the guy<br />that invented it?
4134005 4136713 -Yeah, actually...<br />-I hear all kinds of things.
4136799 4141009 Supposedly, he was born<br />in a mental institution
4141095 4144804 and he sleeps only one hour a night.
4144891 4147383 -He's a great man.<br />-Oh...
4147894 4150226 Do you know about Tyler Durden?
4152065 4153601 (cheering)
4170583 4172449 (cheering)
4175421 4177537 I didn't hurt you, did I?
4177632 4180169 Actually, you did.
4180259 4183843 Thank you for this.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4183930 4186388 Fight Club.
4186474 4188181 This was mine and Tyler's gift.
4188935 4190676 Our gift to the world.
4190770 4194263 I look around, I look around,<br />I see a lot of new faces.
4194524 4196106 (laughing)
4196192 4197978 Shut up!
4198945 4203781 Which means a lot of people have been<br />breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
4211165 4215875 I see in Fight Club the strongest<br />and smartest men who've ever lived.
4215962 4219045 I see all this potential.<br />And I see it squandered.
4221217 4224551 Goddamn it,<br />an entire generation pumping gas.
4224637 4226423 Waiting tables.
4226514 4228926 Slaves with white collars.
4231144 4234057 Advertising has us chasing<br />cars and clothes.
4234147 4237606 Working jobs we hate<br />SO we can buy shit we don't need.
4241320 4245655 We're the middle children of history, men.<br />No purpose or place.
4246492 4248574 We have no Great War.
4248661 4250652 No Great Depression.
4252373 4255286 Our great war is a spiritual war.
4255376 4258038 Our great depression is our lives.
4262508 4265842 We've all been raised on TV to believe<br />that one day we'd be millionaires
4265928 4268295 and movie gods and rock stars.
4268389 4270300 But we won't.
4270391 4273349 We're slowly learning that fact.
4273436 4276349 And we're very, very pissed off.
4276439 4278430 (all) Yeah!
4281027 4283940 First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
4284030 4285737 (banging)
4290328 4292285 Who are you?
4292371 4294954 -Who am I?<br />-Yeah.
4296209 4299702 There's a sign on the front<br />that says Lou's Tavern.
4299796 4304131 I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
4304217 4305799 Tyler Durden.
4308846 4311759 Who told you motherfuckers<br />you could use my place?
4311849 4314841 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
4314936 4319430 Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.<br />He don't own this place. I do.
4322318 4325231 -How much money does he get?<br />-There is no money.
4325321 4327062 -Really?<br />-Free to all.
4327156 4330319 -Ain't that something.<br />-It is, actually.
4330409 4332446 Look, stupid fuck!
4332537 4337532 - Want everybody out of here right now.<br />-Hey! You should join our club.
4338668 4341911 -Did you hear what I just said?<br />-You and your friend.
4342922 4344583 (Tyler groans)
4345216 4346752 You hear me now?
4348427 4350418 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
4350596 4351927 (Tyler groans)
4357144 4359932 Still not getting it.
4360022 4361729 Agh! OK, OK, I got it.
4361816 4364274 I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
4365778 4367894 Back! All of you!
4368865 4370856 (bodyguard) Everybody back!
4372869 4374451 (Tyler laughs)
4376789 4378245 (laughs)
4378499 4379864 Ah, Lou!
4381002 4384711 Come on, man! We really like this place.
4385840 4386830 (groans)
4387675 4389257 (Tyler laughs)
4394140 4396723 -That's right, Lou. Get it out.<br />-Shut the fuck up.
4396809 4398391 Oh, yeah!
4398477 4400218 (laughs)
4402982 4405019 That's fucking funny?
4405902 4408143 (laughs hysterically)
4414368 4417076 Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
4418164 4419825 Unbelievable.
4424337 4426704 -You don't know where I've been, Lou.<br />-Oh, my God!
4427882 4430249 (maniacally)<br />You don't know where I've been!
4433512 4436425 Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
4436515 4441510 -Fucking use the basement! Christ!<br />-I want your word, Lou! I want your word!
4441604 4443345 On my mother's eyes.
4448653 4451270 (Lou groans)
4453032 4454397 Thanks, Lou.
4456786 4458527 You too, big guy.
4462583 4464540 We'll see you next week.
4480226 4483844 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4485189 4489433 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4492071 4494187 You're gonna start a fight,
4494782 4496648 and you're gonna lose.
4499412 4501528 Excellent choice, sir.
4502915 4505623 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4505918 4508330 Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
4511841 4513707 What... Son of a bitch!
4514010 4518470 Most people - normal people -<br />do just about anything to avoid a fight.
4520182 4521672 Excuse me!
4521767 4524008 You sprayed me with your hose.
4524103 4525593 That's not necessary.
4525688 4527349 Jay! Go call 911!
4529066 4530101 (screams)
4530192 4531353 Put the hose down.
4532111 4533943 Stop it! Stop it!
4537241 4538481 Sorry.
4546292 4547373 (grunts) You bastard!
4553632 4555248 We need to talk.
4557970 4559131 OK.
4561098 4562304 Where to begin?
4562475 4565058 With your constant absenteeism?
4565144 4568011 With your unpresentable appearance?
4568147 4572857 -You're up for review.<br />-I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4572943 4574900 -What?<br />-Let's pretend.
4574987 4577854 You're the Department<br />of Transportation, OK?
4578491 4583577 Someone informs you that this company<br />installs front-seat mounting brackets
4583704 4585820 that never pass collision tests,
4585915 4589078 brake linings that fail after a thousand miles,
4589168 4593002 and fuel injectors<br />that explode and burn people alive.
4594507 4595838 What then?
4596467 4598799 -Are you threatening me?<br />-No...
4598886 4602220 -Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!<br />-I have a better solution.
4602681 4605719 Keep me on the payroll<br />as an outside consultant
4606268 4607758 and, in exchange for my salary,
4607853 4611721 my job will be never to tell people<br />these things that I know.
4612650 4617269 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4617363 4621607 Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,<br />you crazy little shit?
4626330 4630119 -Security!<br />-I am Jack's smirking revenge.
4636674 4637880 Agh!
4639510 4641376 What the hell are you doing?
4645099 4646806 (splutters)
4650437 4651802 That hurt.
4654441 4656557 Why would you do that?
4656777 4659394 Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
4659738 4661103 (chokes)
4669915 4671747 What are you doing?
4672251 4674288 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4674420 4677958 For some reason,<br />I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.
4678299 4679460 No!
4704533 4709152 Under and behind and inside<br />everything this man took for granted,
4709246 4712113 something horrible had been growing.
4712625 4716118 Look. Just give me the paychecks,<br />like I asked,
4716212 4718499 and you won't ever see me again.
4718631 4721919 And right then,<br />at our most excellent moment together...
4724428 4725418 (weeps)
4725512 4728049 Thank God! Please don't hit me again.
4728307 4730594 Telephone, computer, fax machine,
4730684 4734894 52 weekly paychecks<br />and 48 airline flight coupons.
4734980 4737472 We now had corporate sponsorship.
4737566 4741150 This is how Tyler and I were able to have<br />Fight Club every night of the week.
4741445 4742981 (cheering)
4744073 4748317 Now, nobody was the center of Fight Club<br />except the two men fighting.
4749203 4752366 The leader walked through the crowd,<br />out in the darkness.
4754166 4757625 Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit<br />with the Pressman Hotel
4757711 4759748 over the urine content of their soup.
4763634 4765716 (cheering)
4766136 4768093 I am Jack's wasted life.
4776647 4778183 Thank you, sir.
4780693 4783310 Tyler dreamed up<br />new homework assignments.
4783404 4786192 He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
4825821 4828813 -There's a Fight Club in Delaware City.<br />-Yeah, I heard.
4830743 4835328 There's one in Penns Grove too.<br />Bob even found one up in New Castle.
4835414 4838122 -Did you start that one?<br />-No, I thought you did.
4838208 4839289 No.
4840085 4841496 (spits)
4890219 4892051 -Stop.<br />-What are we doing?
4892137 4893844 -Turn around.<br />-What are we doing?
4893931 4896548 -Homework assignment.<br />-What kind?
4896642 4898258 Human sacrifice.
4898685 4903521 -Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.<br />-It's a gun. Meet me in the back.
4903607 4906315 -Don't fuck around!<br />-Meet me in the back.
4906985 4909226 On a long enough time line,
4909321 4911983 the survival rate for everyone<br />drops to zero.
4913409 4916652 -Stop. What are you doing?<br />-Hands behind your back.
4917037 4918823 Give me your wallet.
4920582 4923916 Raymond K Hessel.<br />1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.
4924044 4925660 Cramped basement apartment?
4925754 4929292 -How did you know?<br />-They give shitty apartments letters.
4930050 4933088 Raymond! You're going to die.
4933178 4934339 (sobs) No!
4935472 4936712 Is that your mom and dad?
4936807 4939299 They're gonna have to call<br />the kindly doctor.
4939393 4941509 Pick up your dental records. Know why?
4941603 4944937 -There'll be nothing left of your face.<br />-Come on!
4945357 4949567 An expired community college student ID.<br />What did you study, Raymond?
4950028 4952520 -S... Stuff.<br />-(Tyler) Stuff?
4952614 4954525 Were the midterms hard?
4955826 4958534 - I asked you what you studied!<br />-Biology, mostly.
4958620 4961738 -Why?<br />-I don't know.
4961832 4964540 What did you wanna be,<br />Raymond K Hessel?
4966295 4970459 The question, Raymond, was:<br />what did you want to be?
4972426 4973837 Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!
4973927 4976464 -Veterinarian. Veterinarian.<br />-Animals.
4976555 4979217 -Yeah. Animal and stuff.<br />-Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
4979308 4982391 -So you need more schooling.<br />-Too much school.
4982561 4984518 -Would you rather be dead?<br />-No, please...
4984605 4988940 You'd rather die here, on your knees,<br />in the back of a convenience store?
4989776 4991858 (whimpers) No. Please, no.
4995699 4997690 I'm keeping your license.
4998243 5001156 Gonna check in on you.<br />I know where you live.
5002539 5005247 If you're not on your way to being<br />a veterinarian in six weeks,
5005334 5006574 you will be dead.
5006668 5008033 (Raymond sobs)
5009213 5010829 Now run on home.
5015636 5017593 Run, Forrest, run!
5019139 5020504 I feel ill.
5022809 5025972 -Imagine how he feels.<br />-Come on, this isn't funny!
5026063 5029272 What the fuck was the point of that?
5029358 5033022 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day<br />of Raymond K Hessel's life.
5033111 5037571 His breakfast will taste better<br />than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
5038825 5041112 You had to give it to him.
5041411 5043448 -Come on.<br />-He had a plan.
5043539 5046827 And it started to make sense<br />in a Tyler sort of way.
5046917 5050205 No fear. No distractions.
5050295 5054414 The ability to let that<br />which does not matter truly slide.
5067813 5069724 (Tyler) You are not your job.
5071942 5074024 You're not how much money<br />you have in the bank.
5076905 5079146 You're not the car you drive.
5079575 5082488 You're not the contents of your wallet.
5083453 5086036 You're not your fucking khakis.
5087666 5090374 You are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5100053 5102465 I'll be out of your way in a sec.
5103307 5105139 You don't have to go.
5106810 5108050 Whatever.
5109605 5113018 No, I mean... It's OK.
5116028 5117644 (distant clattering)
5120490 5122481 (footsteps)
5122576 5124817 Are you still going to groups?
5125787 5126868 Yeah.
5129082 5130948 Chloe's dead.
5131043 5132408 Wow. Chloe.
5134129 5136461 When did that happen?
5136548 5137959 Do you care?
5138967 5141834 I dunno.<br />I haven't thought about it in a while.
5141928 5143384 Yeah, well...
5144264 5146722 It was the smart move on her part.
5148852 5150308 Listen, um...
5151229 5153937 What are you getting out of all this?
5154024 5155105 What?
5156234 5159226 I mean, all this. Why do you keep...
5159321 5161312 Is this making you happy?
5163241 5165073 Yeah, well, sometimes.
5167079 5168661 I don't know. I don't understand.
5168747 5174834 Why does a weaker person need to latch<br />on to a strong person? What is that?
5174920 5176911 What do you get out of it?
5178924 5183634 No... That's not the same thing at all.<br />It's totally different with us.
5183720 5184710 "Us"?
5184805 5185795 (loud clattering)
5185889 5189427 -What do you mean by "us"?<br />-I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
5189559 5192301 -Hear what?<br />-All that noise. Hold on.
5192479 5195892 No, wait! Don't change the subject!<br />I want to talk about this.
5195982 5198770 -You're not talking about me, are you?<br />-No.
5198860 5202103 -What?<br />-You playing doctor. What was going on?
5202531 5205569 -What are you talking about?<br />-Nothing. Nothing.
5205659 5207650 -I don't think so.<br />-What do you want?
5207744 5209781 -Look at me.<br />-No. What?
5211623 5214365 -What is that?<br />-It's nothing. Don't worry.
5214459 5217372 -My God. Who did this?<br />-A person.
5217504 5218869 Guy or girl?
5218964 5221581 -What do you care?<br />-What do you care if I ask?
5221675 5223291 -Leave me alone.<br />-You're afraid to say.
5223385 5226093 -I am not. Let me go.<br />-No! Talk to me.
5226179 5227965 Let go of me. Leave me alone!
5228056 5230047 -This conversation...<br />-This conversation...
5230142 5232634 -...IS over.<br />-...is over.
5234646 5237058 I just can't win with you, can I?
5245532 5247114 Hey, this is getting a little old!
5247200 5248190 (door chimes)
5249911 5251652 What is... What is all this?
5251747 5253488 What do you think?
5254916 5256907 Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
5257002 5258208 Hey!
5265969 5268051 Too young. Sorry.
5269890 5271472 What's all that?
5271558 5275142 Tell the applicant<br />if he's too young, too old or too fat.
5275228 5276434 Applicant?
5276521 5280105 If the applicant waits three days<br />without food or shelter,
5280192 5282650 he may enter and begin training.
5282736 5284477 Training for what?
5290160 5292026 You think this is a game?
5292120 5294361 You're too young to train here,<br />end of story.
5294456 5297039 Quit wasting our time.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
5298627 5299617 (door opens)
5301671 5304379 Bad news, friend.
5304466 5307083 It's not gonna happen.
5307177 5309134 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
5309221 5312464 It's not the end of the world.<br />Just... go away.
5313975 5315181 Go.
5316019 5319478 You're trespassing<br />and I will have to call the police.
5323401 5327941 Don't you look at me!<br />You're never getting in this fucking house!
5328031 5331365 Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!<br />Get off my porch!
5331451 5334614 Sooner or later,<br />we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
5334704 5337913 I'm gonna go inside<br />and I'm gonna get a shovel.
5345757 5349546 Got two black shirts?<br />Two pair of black pants?
5349678 5352670 -Yes, sir.<br />-One pair black boots? Black socks?
5352764 5354220 -Sir.<br />-One black jacket?
5354307 5356514 -Sir.<br />-$300 personal burial money?
5356601 5358433 Yes, sir.
5360480 5361811 All right.
5372617 5374574 You're too old, fat man.
5375453 5378286 Your tits are too big.<br />Get the fuck off my porch.
5386089 5387454 Bob! Bob!
5403815 5407058 Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
5407193 5408900 Space monkey.
5409362 5412696 Ready to sacrifice himself<br />for the greater good.
5418330 5421243 You are too fucking old, fatty!
5421374 5426164 And you... You're too fucking blond!
5426338 5428705 Get out of here, the both of you!
5429424 5430755 And so it went.
5430842 5432583 (Tyler) Listen up, maggots.
5433303 5435590 You are not special.
5435680 5438798 You are not<br />a beautiful or unique snowflake.
5439684 5442972 You are the same decaying organic matter<br />as everything else.
5443730 5445892 Tyler built himself an army.
5445982 5450192 (Tyler) We are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5450278 5453191 We are all part of the same compost heap.
5455533 5458275 (narrator)<br />Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
5458370 5461988 To what purpose? For what greater good?
5465710 5467621 In Tyler we trusted.
5472217 5477678 (man) When he was like,<br />"You are not your job," I was like, "Yeah!"
5480600 5482716 -Hey, what's all this?<br />-Hey!
5485438 5487429 OK!
5487524 5489606 -What's going on?<br />-We're celebrating.
5489693 5491934 -What are we celebrating?<br />-Go on.
5493279 5494895 (pop music playing on TV)
5496491 5498858 -Hey.<br />-Let me get that for you.
5503331 5506574 (TV) Same great taste.<br />Pepsi. Generation Next.
5507585 5509417 (all) Shh!
5510171 5514665 (TV) Investigators are on the scene.<br />The Police Commissioner has arrived.
5514968 5518256 Could you tell us<br />what you think has happened here?
5518346 5522260 We believe this is one of many<br />recent acts of vandalism around the city
5522350 5525593 somehow related to<br />underground boxing clubs.
5526104 5529438 We will be coordinating<br />a rigorous investigation.
5530358 5533521 That was Commissioner Jacobs<br />who just arrived on the scene
5533611 5539152 -of a four-alarm fire that broke out...<br />-She's hot.
5539367 5541404 Back to you in the studio.
5541745 5543327 -Yeah!<br />-Yeah!
5544831 5547038 -Holy shit!<br />-Yeah!
5553757 5555998 What the fuck did you guys do?
5556426 5558793 (TV) Arson investigators<br />are on the premises...
5559721 5561303 (laughter)
5565143 5569478 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions, sir.
5575653 5579487 The victory in the war against crime<br />will not come overnight.
5579741 5584201 It will take dedication and commitment<br />and, most of all, cooperation.
5584454 5587913 Streets are safer now.<br />There is hope in the inner city.
5588416 5591329 -However...<br />-I gotta take a piss.
5592170 5595754 These are the first steps in a long journey.
5595840 5597126 That is why we have<br />created Project Hope...
5597217 5598548 Bob.
5598635 5601798 (speaker) ...helping others<br />with prevention and enforcement.
5602680 5604887 Project Hope will be a joint effort
5604974 5607341 between the police<br />and community leaders.
5608019 5611683 It will be a powerful new weapon<br />in the war against crime.
5611856 5613472 (applause)
5647267 5648598 (waiter yells)
5658611 5663026 -Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.<br />-Man! His balls are ice-cold.
5663908 5667026 Hi. You're gonna call off<br />your rigorous investigation.
5667120 5669862 You will publicly state<br />there is no underground group
5669956 5673494 or these guys are gonna take your balls.
5673585 5678250 They'll send one to the New York Times<br />and one to the LA Times.
5678339 5682048 Look, the people you are after<br />are the people you depend on.
5682135 5686129 We cook your meals. We haul your trash.<br />We connect your calls.
5686264 5689973 We drive your ambulances.<br />We guard you while you sleep.
5694439 5696225 Do not fuck with us.
5701654 5703486 (muffled yell)
5705867 5707232 Ball check!
5711789 5713279 (loud machinery)
5722133 5723840 Bob, this way.
5724886 5726342 Let's go.
5727555 5730547 I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.
5731059 5732094 Hey!
5747784 5749024 Yeah!
5750411 5752322 (shouts of encouragement)
5762340 5764081 (cheering)
5781567 5786653 I felt like putting a bullet in every panda<br />that wouldn't screw to save its species.
5789867 5792609 I wanted to open<br />the dump valves on oil tankers
5792704 5795947 and smother all those French beaches<br />I'd never see.
5800253 5802585 I wanted to breathe smoke.
5819397 5821729 Where did you go, psycho boy?
5823151 5826064 I felt like destroying something beautiful.
5830241 5832824 -Get him to a fucking hospital.<br />-Yeah.
5844756 5848249 Don't worry, Mr. Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.
5849260 5851046 After you, Mr. Durden.
5852513 5853844 After you.
5871866 5874654 -Something on your mind, dear?<br />-No.
5874744 5877486 Yeah. Why wasn't I told<br />about Project Mayhem?
5877580 5881539 First rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions.
5881626 5885210 -Why wasn't I included in the beginning?<br />-Fight Club was the beginning.
5885296 5888505 Now it's left the basements<br />and it's Project Mayhem.
5888591 5891458 We started Fight Club<br />together. Remember?
5891552 5893293 It's as much mine as it is yours.
5893429 5897423 -Is this about you and me?<br />-Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
5897517 5899633 This does not belong to us.
5899727 5902640 -We are not special.<br />-Fuck that. You should have told me.
5904482 5905517 Hey, Tyler!
5905608 5906939 (horn blares)
5908236 5910318 -Goddamn it, Tyler!<br />-What do you want?
5910405 5913614 A statement of purpose?<br />Should I email you?
5913699 5916316 -Look...<br />-You decide your level of involvement!
5916411 5918652 I will! I wanna know certain things first!
5918746 5921158 -The first rule of Project Mayhem...<br />-Shut up!
5923000 5926664 - Wanna know what you're thinking.<br />-Fuck what you know!
5927338 5930581 Forget about what you think you know<br />about life, friendship,
5930675 5933167 and especially about you and me.
5934429 5937046 What is that supposed to mean? What...
5939517 5941508 What are you doing?
5943229 5945186 What'll you wish you'd done<br />before you die?
5945273 5947890 -Paint a self-portrait.<br />-Build a house.
5948234 5950771 -And you?<br />-I don't know. Nothing.
5950862 5953103 -Get in the right lane.<br />-You have to know!
5953197 5955985 If you died now,<br />how would you feel about your life?
5956075 5960444 I don't know! Nothing good.<br />Is that what you want to hear me say?
5960538 5962279 -Come on!<br />-Not good enough.
5962373 5964535 Stop fucking around! Tyler!
5964625 5966161 (horns blare)
5967670 5969286 Jesus Christ!
5969380 5971792 Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
5971883 5975751 Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!<br />I am sick of all your shit!
5977263 5979300 OK, man. OK.
5980183 5982390 -Quit screwing around. Steer!<br />-Look at you!
5982560 5985723 -Steer!<br />-Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
5985813 5990432 -Why? Why? What are you talking about?<br />-Why do you think I blew up your condo?
5991444 5992650 What?
5992737 5996401 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.<br />It's not a goddamn seminar.
5997241 6000404 Stop trying to control everything<br />and just let go!
6003498 6005785 -Let go!<br />-All right. Fine.
6007376 6008491 Fine.
6067687 6070099 I'd never been in a car accident.
6071315 6073397 This must have been<br />what all those people felt like
6073484 6076602 before I filed them<br />as statistics in my reports.
6077405 6078611 Goddamn!
6080283 6081819 (Tyler laughs)
6082785 6085402 We've just had a near-life experience!
6090793 6095663 (Tyler) In the world I see, you're stalking elk<br />through the Grand Canyon forests
6095756 6098464 around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
6100595 6105010 You'll wear leather clothes<br />that will last you the rest of your life.
6105391 6109305 You'll climb the thick kudzu vines<br />that wrap the Sears Tower.
6110646 6114480 And when you look down,<br />you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
6115151 6116391 laying strips of venison
6116485 6120604 in the empty car-pool lane<br />of some abandoned superhighway.
6133711 6135497 Feel better, champ.
6141594 6142925 (door slams shut)
6153898 6155309 And then...
6155399 6156810 Tyler?
6156901 6158562 ... Tyler was gone.
6167036 6168492 Was I asleep?
6170539 6171904 Had I slept?
6171999 6174536 (man) You are not<br />a beautiful, unique snowflake...
6174627 6177665 The house had become a living thing,
6177755 6181089 wet inside from so many people<br />sweating and breathing.
6181175 6182757 We are all part<br />of the same compost heap...
6182843 6186962 So many people moving, the house moved.
6188140 6190006 Planet Tyler.
6190101 6194811 I had to hug the walls, trapped inside<br />this clockwork of space monkeys.
6195106 6198269 You can't be smoking!<br />You know how much ether is in here?
6198359 6201192 Cooking and working<br />and sleeping in teams.
6201529 6203270 (phone rings)
6204448 6206109 Hang on a second.
6209745 6211406 (police radio)
6225886 6227376 It's under control, sir.
6230641 6232177 Where's Tyler?
6232268 6235056 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not...
6235146 6237308 Right. OK.
6239650 6241140 I'm all alone.
6241736 6245104 My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.
6245698 6247689 I am Jack's broken heart.
6252288 6255826 What comes next in Project Mayhem<br />only Tyler knows.
6256667 6259659 The second rule is<br />you do not ask questions.
6262798 6265711 Get the fuck away from me!<br />Get the fuck away!
6266552 6268543 Who are all these people?
6273267 6275508 The Paper Street Soap Company.
6278063 6279553 Can I come in?
6282860 6284350 He's not here.
6285154 6286235 What?
6287865 6290607 Tyler isn't here.
6291869 6293860 Tyler went away.
6293954 6295410 Tyler's gone.
6301128 6303210 (car horns blare)
6306050 6307131 (dogs bark)
6311847 6313633 (man) Jesus! Get some help!
6314892 6316849 <i>(yelling)</i>
6326570 6330188 Two gunshot wounds coming through!<br />Make some fucking room!
6330616 6332653 What happened? What happened?
6332743 6334029 We were on assignment.
6334119 6337202 We were supposed to Kill<br />two birds with one stone.
6337373 6339865 Destroy a piece of corporate art...
6339959 6342417 Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
6343921 6346413 ...and trash a franchise coffee bar.
6352429 6354921 We had it all worked out, sir.
6362815 6366149 -It went smooth until...<br />-Police! Freeze!
6366235 6369023 -What?<br />-They shot Bob.
6370614 6373447 -They shot him in the head.<br />-Fucking pigs!
6376370 6378281 (groans of disgust)
6378372 6380033 Oh, God!
6380124 6383958 -Those motherfuckers!<br />-You morons.
6384461 6387419 You run around in ski masks<br />trying to blow things up?
6387506 6390043 What did you think was gonna happen?
6393304 6396922 OK, quick! We gotta<br />get rid of the evidence - his body!
6397016 6399053 -Bury him.<br />-What?
6399268 6401805 Take him to the garden and bury him.
6402563 6406773 -Come on, people, let's go!<br />-Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
6406859 6408224 What are you talking about?
6408319 6411152 This isn't fucking evidence.<br />This is a person.
6411322 6414360 He's my friend<br />and you're not burying him in the garden!
6414450 6417158 He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
6417244 6420077 -This is Bob.<br />-But, sir, in...
6420164 6422405 In Project Mayhem, we have no names.
6422499 6423830 Now, you listen to me.
6423918 6428412 This is a man and he has a name,<br />and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
6428505 6429586 Robert Paulsen?
6429673 6432005 He's a man,<br />and he's dead now because of us.
6432092 6433924 Do you understand that?
6435012 6436502 I understand.
6438766 6443135 In death, a member of Project Mayhem<br />has a name.
6444980 6447062 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6447858 6449974 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6450611 6453478 His name... is Robert Paulsen.
6454448 6457031 (all) His name is Robert Paulsen.
6457201 6460410 -Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.<br />-(all chant) His name is Robert Paulsen.
6460913 6462870 (chanting continues)
6463999 6466491 Shut up! This is all over with!
6468003 6470210 (chanting continues)
6470714 6472546 (muttering)
6482768 6484884 (chanting continues)
6498534 6500150 (phone rings)
6501245 6502280 Tyler?
6502371 6504863 No, this is Detective Stern<br />of the Arson Unit.
6505082 6506572 I need to see you...
6511171 6515290 I went to all the cities<br />on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.
6516010 6517341 I didn't know how,
6517428 6520511 but I could look at 50 different bars,<br />and somehow I just knew.
6520597 6525137 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.<br />It's very important that I talk to him.
6525227 6527184 I wish I could help you,
6527396 6528431 Sir.
6534778 6536610 Every city I went to,
6537781 6540239 as soon as I set foot off the plane,
6540325 6542566 I knew a Fight Club was close.
6543328 6544363 Hey! Hey!
6545622 6546783 Taxi!
6546957 6548413 Look at my face. I'm a member.
6548500 6551709 Now, I just need to know<br />if you've seen Tyler.
6551795 6555413 I'm not exposed to bespeak<br />any such information to you,
6555507 6559842 nor would I, even if I had said information<br />at this juncture, be able.
6561972 6564464 -You're a moron.<br />-I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
6566143 6571229 Tyler had been busy,<br />setting up franchises all over the country.
6574026 6577314 Was I asleep? Had I slept?
6578447 6581155 Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?
6582159 6584526 -We've just heard the stories.<br />-What stories?
6584620 6589205 -Nobody knows what he looks like.<br />-He has plastic surgery every three years.
6589750 6591866 That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
6591960 6596329 -Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?<br />-Is Mr. Durden building an army?
6597174 6600292 I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
6601178 6604341 Everywhere I went,<br />I felt I'd already been there.
6605099 6607807 It was like following an invisible man.
6609019 6611135 The smell of dried blood.
6612189 6615147 Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.
6615234 6618147 That aroma of old sweat,<br />like fried chicken.
6618862 6623151 The feel of a floor still warm<br />from a fight the night before.
6623242 6625984 I was always just one step behind Tyler.
6628956 6634201 (chanting) His name is Robert Paulsen.<br />His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
6637047 6638708 (man) Welcome back, sir.
6640175 6641836 How have you been?
6642970 6644506 Do you know me?
6645055 6648047 -Is this a test, sir?<br />-No. This is not a test.
6649726 6652013 You were in here last Thursday.
6652563 6653803 Thursday?
6654356 6658520 You were standing where you are now,<br />asking how good security is.
6659069 6661106 It's tight as a drum, sir.
6663240 6665106 Who do you think I am?
6665909 6669573 -Are you sure this isn't a test?<br />-No, this is not a test.
6671165 6672781 You're Mr. Durden.
6673750 6676082 You're the one who gave me this.
6677171 6680880 Please return your seat backs<br />to their full upright and locked position.
6688432 6690298 (phone rings)
6692686 6694176 -Yeah?<br />-Marla, it's me.
6694271 6696387 -Have we ever done it?<br />-Done what?
6696481 6699564 -Had sex.<br />-What kind of stupid question is that?
6699651 6702814 Stupid because the answer's yes<br />or because it's no?
6702905 6704896 -Is this a trick?<br />-No. I need to know...
6704990 6709484 You wanna know if I think<br />we were just having sex or making love?
6709578 6712195 -We did make love?<br />-Is that what you're calling it?
6712456 6715699 Just answer the question!<br />Did we do it or not?
6715792 6718534 You fuck me, then snub me.<br />You love me, you hate me.
6718629 6721212 You're sensitive,<br />then you turn into an asshole.
6721298 6723960 Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
6724635 6726717 (narrator) We have just lost cabin pressure.
6726887 6728673 -What did you say?<br />-What is wrong with you?
6728764 6731222 -Say my name!<br />-Tyler Durden.
6731308 6733891 Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!<br />What's going on?
6733977 6736014 -I'm coming over!<br />-I'm not there!
6736104 6737094 (line goes dead)
6738106 6740143 You broke your promise.
6740234 6742521 -Jesus, Tyler.<br />-You talked to her about me.
6742611 6747777 -What the fuck is going on?<br />-I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.
6747866 6750278 Why do people think that I'm you?
6750869 6752200 Answer me!
6756333 6757414 Sit.
6760712 6763704 Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
6764007 6765748 I think you know.
6765842 6767924 -No, I don't.<br />-Yes, you do.
6768011 6771049 Why would anyone<br />possibly confuse you with me?
6772474 6774135 I... I don't know.
6778689 6780521 -You got it.<br />-No.
6780774 6783516 -Do not fuck with us!<br />-Say it.
6785070 6786401 Because...
6788198 6789404 Say it!
6791410 6793697 Because we're the same person.
6793954 6795035 That's right.
6795122 6797705 We are the all-singing, all-dancing...
6797791 6801500 -I don't understand this.<br />-You wanted a way to change your life.
6801586 6803793 You could not do this on your own.
6803880 6807123 All the ways you wish you could be -<br />that's me.
6808302 6810589 I look like you wanna look,<br />fuck like you wanna fuck,
6810679 6815845 I am smart, capable and, most importantly,<br />I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
6816143 6817178 Oh, no.
6817269 6820432 -Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.<br />-What?
6820522 6824766 -This isn't possible. This is crazy.<br />-People do it every day.
6825027 6828816 They talk to themselves.<br />They see themselves as they'd like to be.
6828905 6832944 They don't have the courage you have<br />to just run with it.
6835287 6838905 You still wrestle with it,<br />so sometimes you're still you.
6838999 6840535 We should do this again sometime.
6840917 6843158 Other times,<br />you imagine you're watching me.
6843253 6846120 If this is your first time, you have to fight.
6846214 6849878 Little by little,<br />you're just letting yourself become...
6851845 6853006 Tyler Durden.
6853096 6856634 You are not your job<br />or how much money you have!
6857059 6858766 -No. You have a house.<br />-Rented in your name.
6858852 6862436 -You have jobs, a life.<br />-You work nights because you can't sleep.
6862606 6866440 -Or you stay up and make soap.<br />-You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
6866526 6869063 Technically, you are.<br />But it's all the same to her.
6871740 6873276 Oh, my God.
6874117 6876199 Now you see our dilemma.
6876787 6878653 She knows too much.
6879581 6882790 I think we're gonna have to talk about<br />how this might compromise our goals.
6884961 6887168 What... What are you saying?
6887297 6891291 This is bullshit. This is bullshit!<br />I'm not listening to this.
6891385 6894377 -You are insane!<br />-No. You're insane.
6894471 6897634 And we simply<br />do not have time for this crap.
6899351 6901262 It's called a changeover.
6901353 6905392 The movie goes on,<br />and nobody in the audience has any idea.
6919162 6922780 -Sir! Are you checking out?<br />-Yeah. Bill me.
6922874 6926333 I need you to initial<br />this list of phone calls, please.
6929840 6933549 -When were these made?<br />-Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
6939015 6941347 Have I been going to bed earlier<br />every night?
6941435 6943597 Have I been sleeping later?
6945188 6948101 Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
6951862 6953444 Is anybody here?
6955866 6958358 Déjà vu, all over again.
6959536 6962574 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
6965333 6966789 Oh, my God.
6968837 6970453 (ringing tone)
6970547 6972538 -(man) 1888.<br />-Who am I calling?
6972966 6975207 Franklin. This is maintenance.
6976761 6979344 Hello? Hello?
6979431 6981047 Franklin Street?
6982225 6984182 Yes. Can I help you?
6986771 6989354 -Hello?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
6989900 6992062 I need to talk to your supervisor<br />right away.
6992152 6994109 -Speaking.<br />-OK, listen to me.
6994196 6997279 Something terrible<br />is about to happen to your building.
6997365 6999322 It's under control, sir.
7000035 7003494 -Excuse me?<br />-Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
7007501 7008582 (man) 2160.
7017010 7019593 Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
7021473 7024056 Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7024142 7026679 Your bald freaks hit me<br />with a fucking broom!
7026770 7028477 They almost broke my arm!
7028563 7030099 They were burning<br />their fingertips with lye.
7032192 7034980 It'll take a tremendous act of faith<br />on your part, but hear me out.
7035070 7038779 -Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />-A little more faith than that.
7043161 7044993 I don't wanna hear<br />anything you have to say.
7045080 7047822 You have every right to be...
7047916 7049498 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7049584 7052076 Sir, anything you order<br />is free of charge, sir.
7053296 7055958 -Why is it free of charge?<br />-(whispers) Don't ask.
7056174 7057414 Whatever.
7057509 7058965 I'll have the clam chowder,
7059052 7062386 fried chicken with a baked potato<br />and chocolate chiffon pie.
7062472 7064554 Clean food, please.
7064641 7067224 In that case, sir,<br />I advise against the clam chowder.
7067310 7069426 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7072065 7074056 (Marla) You got about 30 seconds.
7075694 7078903 I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
7079239 7081731 I know it seems there's two sides to me...
7081825 7083907 Two sides?<br />You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
7083994 7087328 I deserved that.<br />But I realized something important.
7087414 7088620 What?
7088707 7091950 The full extent of our relationship<br />wasn't clear to me until now,
7092043 7094080 for reasons I won't go into.
7094170 7096582 -I know I haven't treated you well.<br />-Whatever.
7096673 7101088 No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!<br />Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
7101636 7103752 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
7103847 7107511 What I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7109686 7111472 -You do?<br />-I really do.
7112230 7116645 I care about you and I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7116735 7119352 Your life is in danger.
7121197 7124030 -What?<br />-You need to leave town for a while.
7124159 7126446 Get out of any major city.<br />Just go camping...
7126536 7128243 You're an insane person.
7128330 7132073 -I've involved you in something terrible.<br />-No. Shut up!
7132167 7134249 -You're not safe.<br />-(yells) Shut up!
7136713 7140877 -Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />-I know you did.
7141051 7146217 There are things about you I like.<br />You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
7146890 7149473 But... you're intolerable.
7150143 7153977 You have very serious emotional problems
7154064 7155975 for which you should seek<br />professional help.
7156066 7160230 -I know, and I'm sorry.<br />-You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.
7161613 7163604 I can't do this anymore.
7164449 7166907 I can't. I won't.
7168787 7170073 I'm gone.
7171039 7173246 You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7176878 7178585 -Marla, you don't understand!<br />-Leave me alone!
7178672 7180879 I am trying to protect you!
7181091 7184254 -I never want to see you again!<br />-If that's what it takes...
7184636 7186377 Wait right here.
7189766 7190722 (horn blares)
7190809 7192766 Hold it right there! Shut up!
7193395 7196808 Take this money and get on this bus.<br />I promise I will never bother you again.
7196898 7198013 (horn)
7198108 7199394 Shut up!
7199484 7202442 Please get on the bus.<br />Please get on the bus.
7203988 7206821 -Why are you doing this?<br />-They think you're a threat.
7206908 7209024 I can't explain now. Trust me.
7209119 7211030 If I see where you're going,<br />you won't be safe.
7211121 7213738 I'm not paying this back.<br />I consider it asshole tax.
7213832 7217621 Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities<br />for a couple of days, OK?
7217711 7218951 Tyler...
7220463 7222704 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7237689 7240181 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7240859 7243100 I am the leader of a terrorist organization
7243194 7247688 responsible for numerous acts<br />of vandalism and assault all over this city.
7248366 7251825 In the metropolitan area,<br />we had probably 200 members.
7252245 7256239 Chapters have sprung up<br />in five or six other major cities already.
7256332 7259541 This is a tightly regimented organization
7259627 7264167 with many cells capable of operating<br />independent of central leadership.
7265175 7269009 Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.
7269637 7271253 That's our headquarters.
7271347 7276183 In the back, buried in the garden,<br />you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7277520 7279852 In the basement, you'll find some bathtubs
7279939 7284524 that have been used very recently<br />to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7285779 7288612 I believe the plan is<br />to blow up the headquarters
7288698 7290530 of these credit-card companies
7290617 7292403 and the TRW building.
7294162 7297530 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit-card companies?
7297916 7301329 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7302212 7304294 You'll create total chaos.
7306841 7309833 Keep him talking.<br />I need to make a phone call.
7319979 7322391 I really admire what you're doing.
7323566 7326274 -What?<br />-You're a brave man to order this.
7327237 7329023 You're a genius, Sir.
7329113 7333107 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7334244 7335780 we gotta get his balls.
7336913 7340372 -Don't fight.<br />-It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
7340458 7343621 -It'll set quite an example.<br />-You're making a big mistake!
7343711 7345918 -You said you'd say that.<br />-I'm not Tyler Durden!
7346005 7348292 You told us you'd say that too.
7348842 7350833 All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7350927 7355546 Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.<br />We're aborting this mission now.
7355640 7358348 You said you would definitely say that.
7360144 7361680 (muffled) Let me go!
7362939 7366603 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7368403 7369859 Is somebody timing this?
7369946 7371732 Keep your mouth shut.
7371823 7372938 (knocking)
7373032 7374113 Shit!
7377787 7380779 -Some of this information checks out.<br />-Uh-huh?
7381165 7384032 -Let's go to that house on Paper Street.<br />-Be right there.
7384127 7385288 (door closes)
7385378 7386459 Hey, wait!
7386629 7387869 -You got him?<br />-I got him.
7387964 7389580 Sir, we have to do this.
7389674 7392416 -Stop fighting!<br />-Where's the rubber band?
7392510 7395502 Get away from me!<br />Drop that fucking knife!
7398558 7402096 Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
7404230 7406096 Get down on the floor!
7410653 7414738 First person that comes out this door<br />gets a lead salad! Understand?
7435094 7436710 (car horn)
7437847 7438837 (horn)
7439599 7441510 Get away! Stay away!
7445521 7447228 (horns blare)
7454656 7455817 I ran.
7457325 7461193 I ran until my muscles burned<br />and my veins pumped battery acid.
7463957 7465994 Then I ran some more.
7507542 7510534 What the fuck are you doing,<br />running around in your underpants?
7510628 7512414 You look crazy!
7512505 7515497 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7515591 7520381 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. It'll be like Pay-per-view.
7521764 7523129 (laughs)
7567977 7568967 (regular beeping)
7569062 7570348 Oh, Christ.
7570438 7572270 Now what are you doing?
7572356 7574438 -I'm stopping this.<br />-Why?
7574984 7578773 -The greatest thing you've ever done.<br />-I can't let this happen.
7578863 7580979 There are 10 other bombs<br />in 10 other buildings.
7581574 7583690 Since when is Project Mayhem<br />about murder?
7583785 7589030 The buildings are empty. We're not<br />killing anyone. We're setting them free!
7589123 7591911 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7592543 7594625 You wanna make an omelet,<br />you gotta break eggs.
7594712 7598000 No. I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7605389 7609303 Wouldn't do that.<br />Not unless I knew which wires were what.
7609393 7611350 If you know, then I know.
7616692 7621528 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />all day thinking about the wrong ones.
7629914 7631245 You think?
7632583 7635120 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7635211 7637669 Pull any one but the green one.
7638548 7640255 (beeping stops)
7642760 7645218 I asked you not to do that!
7647557 7648718 (Tyler) Fuck!
7650017 7652224 Tyler, get away from the van.
7654230 7657222 Tyler, I'm not kidding!<br />Get away from the van!
7658151 7659516 Goddamn it!
7660903 7663065 Whoa! Whoa!
7666200 7667440 OK.
7667535 7670653 You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend
7670746 7673408 near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
7675751 7677833 Cool it, Tyler!
7680715 7681705 (grunts)
7690808 7693516 Aw, come on! Don't go!
7732642 7733723 What?
7779355 7782893 Three minutes. This is it.
7783234 7785350 The beginning.
7785444 7786900 Ground zero.
7786988 7791607 - I think this is about where we came in.<br />-Want to say a few words for the occasion?
7791701 7793863 (mumbles)
7794287 7795402 I'm sorry?
7795496 7797863 I still can't think of anything.
7799208 7801119 Ah. Flashback humor.
7806966 7809173 It's getting exciting now.
7810553 7814046 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
7815975 7820060 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7820229 7823187 One step closer to economic equilibrium.
7837997 7840705 -Why is she here?<br />-Tying up loose ends.
7841459 7844247 Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
7844962 7849331 - I beg you, please don't do this.<br />-I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
7849425 7852417 -This is what we want.<br />-No. I don't want this.
7852595 7857340 Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.<br />We have to forget about you.
7858267 7861180 -You're a voice in my head.<br />-You're a voice in mine!
7861270 7864854 -Why can't I get rid of you?<br />-You need me.
7864940 7867272 No. I don't. I really don't anymore.
7867360 7871445 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make me feel better.
7871655 7874022 -Take some responsibility.<br />- I do.
7874116 7877609 I am responsible for all of it,<br />and I accept that.
7877703 7881287 So, please, I'm begging you,<br />please call this off.
7883793 7885750 Have I ever let us down?
7887421 7890129 How far have you come because of me?
7895596 7897678 I will bring us through this.
7897765 7901599 As always, I will carry you<br />kicking and screaming,
7901727 7904185 and in the end you will thank me.
7904438 7906930 Tyler. Tyler.
7907066 7910934 I'm grateful to you<br />for everything that you've done for me.
7911028 7913440 But this is too much. I don't want this.
7913531 7918321 What do you want? Your shit job back?<br />Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
7918411 7920448 Fuck you! I won't do it.
7921455 7925289 -This can't be happening.<br />-It's already done, so shut up!
7925876 7929369 -60 seconds till CRI.<br />-No.
7931090 7934082 I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
7934427 7938261 You're not real. That gun...<br />That gun isn't even in your hand.
7939432 7941218 The gun's in my hand.
7947356 7950144 Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
7958367 7961155 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
7961829 7963740 Not my head, Tyler.
7964039 7965450 Our head.
7967585 7968996 Interesting.
7972465 7975378 Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
7981432 7984174 Hey. It's you and me.
7988147 7989478 Friends?
7990900 7992231 Tyler,
7995613 7998196 I want you to really listen to me.
7998866 7999901 OK.
8001911 8003743 My eyes are open.
8015090 8016080 (Sniffs)
8021305 8023012 What's that smell?
8037279 8038440 (lift bell)
8041617 8043574 (man laughs)
8043744 8047078 -Where is everybody?<br />-Oh, no. What's going on?
8047581 8049071 Mr. Durden!
8049458 8050948 Oh, my God!
8051961 8052996 Sir!
8056465 8059628 Are you... Are you all right, sir?
8060052 8063761 -(gurgling) Oh, yeah, I'm OK.<br />-You look terrible, sir. What happened?
8064098 8067762 -Oh, nothing, it's no problem.<br />-No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
8067851 8071469 -You look awful. You need assistance.<br />-(rasping) I'm fine.
8071981 8074439 Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
8074817 8076433 (shouting and running)
8076527 8079394 Ow! Stop it!
8079488 8081946 -Let her go.<br />-Christ Almighty!
8082825 8084031 <i>You!</i>
8084827 8086158 Hi, Marla.
8087663 8091622 -Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.<br />-Are you sure?
8091834 8093495 Yes, I'm sure.
8095337 8099501 You fucker! What sick fucking game<br />are you playing at, putting me on a...
8099592 8101959 Oh, my God, your face!
8102052 8103542 Yeah, I know.
8109018 8111225 -What happened?<br />-(gasps) Don't ask.
8111312 8113269 -You're shot.<br />-Yes, I'm shot.
8113355 8115187 Oh, my God.
8115316 8118650 -I can't believe he's standing.<br />-Tough motherfucker.
8122823 8124359 Who did this?
8124908 8126524 (winces) I did, actually.
8127244 8128951 Find some gauze.
8130581 8134870 -You shot yourself?<br />-Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.
8134960 8136450 I'm really OK.
8137963 8140955 Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
8141050 8143212 ("Where Is My Mind?” by The Pixies)
8154313 8156896 You met me at<br />a very strange time in my life.
