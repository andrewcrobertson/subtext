124090 127210 <i>People always ask me<br />if I know Tyler Durden.</i>
128160 129180 Three minutes.
129260 131590 This is it. Ground zero.
131660 135360 Do you have a speech for the occasion?
135430 138990 <i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,<br />you speak only in vowels.</i>
139070 141160 I can't think of anything.
141240 145110 <i>For a second, I forget about<br />Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>
145210 147370 <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>
147440 149500 It's getting exciting now.
149610 152780 <i>That old thing,<br />how you always hurt the one you love.</i>
152880 154980 <i>Well, it works both ways.</i>
155050 159320 <i>We have front-row seats<br />for this theater of mass destruction.</i>
159420 162190 <i>The Demolitions Committee<br />of Project Mayhem</i>
162260 165700 <i>wrapped the foundations<br />of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>
166460 169860 <i>In two minutes,<br />primary charges will blow base charges</i>
169930 173300 <i>and a few blocks will be reduced<br />to smouldering rubble.</i>
173400 176430 <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>
176510 179910 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
180010 185350 <i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,<br />the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>
185450 188720 <i>has got something to do<br />with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>
191260 193620 <i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>
193690 197890 <i>This was a support group<br />for men with testicular cancer.</i>
197960 201260 <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,<br />that was Bob.</i>
201330 203490 We're still men.
203570 205760 Yes, we're men.
205900 208070 Men is what we are.
208140 211580 <i>Bob had had his testicles removed.<br />Then hormone therapy.</i>
211680 215480 <i>He developed bitch tits because<br />his testosterone was too high</i>
215550 217680 <i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>
217750 221480 <i>- That was where I fit...<br />- They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>
221550 224050 <i>..between those huge sweating tits</i>
224120 228360 <i>that hung enormous,<br />the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>
228460 230660 OK, you cry now.
230730 233290 <i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>
234540 237300 <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>
237370 239930 <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>
240010 242170 <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>
242280 244340 <i>Everything's far away.</i>
245280 247610 <i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>
247710 249740 <i>of a copy.</i>
252090 257610 <i>When deep space exploration ramps up,<br />it'll be the corporations that name everything.</i>
257720 259780 <i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>
260130 262190 <i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>
262300 264360 <i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>
264930 267990 I need you out of town this week<br />to cover some red flags.
268100 271630 <i>It must have been Tuesday.<br />He had on his cornflower blue tie.</i>
271740 276340 You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
276410 281010 Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.<br />Call me if there's any snags.
281120 284980 <i>He was full of pep.<br />Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>
286060 291220 <i>Like so many others, I had become<br />a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i>
291330 293660 Yes. I'd like to order
293760 296030 the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
296130 298230 <i>- Please hold.<br />- Anything clever,</i>
298340 302670 <i>like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,<br />I had to have it.</i>
303740 306140 <i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>
306210 308470 <i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>
308850 312410 <i>Or the Ohamshab sofa<br />with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>
312480 317980 <i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of<br />environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.</i>
318050 320850 <i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i>
320990 324020 <i>"What kind of dining set<br />defines me as a person?"</i>
324090 328860 <i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes<br />with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>
329000 334060 <i>proof that they were crafted by the honest,<br />hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>
334170 337110 <i>- Please hold.<br />- ..wherever.</i>
337610 339700 <i>We used to read pornography.</i>
339810 342640 <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>
342710 346110 - No. You can't die of insomnia.<br />- What about narcolepsy?
346220 348580 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
348650 350710 I have no idea how I got there.
350820 354620 - You need to lighten up.<br />- Can you please just give me something?
354690 358320 <i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...</i>
358730 362190 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
362900 366390 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
368440 370500 Hey, come on.
370610 372670 - I'm in pain.<br />- You wanna see pain?
372750 375310 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
375420 378480 See the guys with testicular cancer.
378550 380640 That's pain.
396540 399940 I always wanted three kids...<br />two boys and a girl.
400070 402440 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
404040 406510 We never could agree on anything.
406850 408650 Well, I... She...
408720 411240 She had her first child last week.
411320 413550 A girl.
413650 416890 With... With her... With her new husband.
417730 419790 Fuck!
421130 423190 Thank God, you know...
423300 425360 I'm glad for her.
426170 429140 She deserves...
432940 436780 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
436880 438940 Thank you, Thomas.
439080 442520 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
442590 444680 And that gives me strength.
444750 447120 We give each other strength.
447190 449490 It's time for the one-on-ones.
450090 454500 So let's all of us follow Thomas's example<br />and really open ourselves up.
454560 456620 Could you find a partner?
458800 461970 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>
463640 466840 <i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>
469350 472140 <i>Knees together. Those awkward little steps.</i>
477350 479450 - My name is Bob.<br />- Bob?
480160 482420 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>
482530 486190 <i>You know that chest expansion programme<br />on late-night TV?</i>
486260 488360 <i>That was his idea.</i>
488430 490530 I was a juicer.
490600 492730 You know, using steroids?
492800 495330 Diabonal and
495410 497740 Wisterol.
497810 501750 Oh, they use that on racehorses,<br />for Christ sakes.
502250 504340 And now I'm bankrupt.
505220 507280 I'm divorced.
508020 510150 My two grown kids
510990 513650 won't even return my phone calls.
513760 518820 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty<br />make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>
520630 522690 Go ahead,... Cornelius.
522800 524860 You can cry.
540620 544060 <i>And then... something happened.<br />I let go.</i>
544190 546250 That's really good.
546330 548420 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>
548500 550790 <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>
553800 557500 <i>I found freedom.<br />Losing all hope was freedom.</i>
559940 562030 It's OK.
564310 566510 <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>
570120 572710 <i>I became addicted.</i>
586430 588490 If I didn't say anything
588570 591270 people always assumed the worst.
595110 598170 They cried harder... then I cried harder.
607590 611750 Now we're going to open the green door,<br />the heart chakra...
611860 613920 <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>
614060 616790 <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>
617730 621600 <i>I was the warm little center<br />that the life of this world crowded around.</i>
622610 625580 Imagine your pain<br />as a white ball of healing light.
625680 629770 It moves over your body, healing you.
629880 633370 Now keep this going. Remember to breathe
633480 637150 and step forward<br />through the back door of the room.
637990 640120 Where does it lead?
640220 642350 To your cave.
642430 644330 Step forward
644400 646590 into your cave.
646700 648760 That's right.
648830 652330 You're going deeper into your cave.
653000 655100 And you're going to find
655170 657300 your power animal.
659410 660740 Slide.
671830 673920 <i>Every evening I died.</i>
675060 677760 <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>
678360 680420 <i>Resurrected.</i>
682440 686670 <i>Bob loved me because he thought<br />my testicles were removed too.</i>
686770 689570 <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>
689640 691740 <i>ready to cry.</i>
691810 694470 <i>This was my vacation.</i>
696780 698410 <i>And she</i>
698490 701150 <i>ruined everything.</i>
701220 703350 This is cancer, right?
706230 708460 <i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>
708560 711190 <i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>
711300 713390 <i>She was a liar.</i>
713470 715560 <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>
715640 719440 <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,<br />my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>
719510 722970 <i>Then at Hope,<br />my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>
723480 728440 <i>And again, at Seize The Day,<br />my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>
729580 731580 <i>Marla,</i>
731650 734120 <i>the big tourist.</i>
734220 736320 <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>
736860 738920 <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>
739030 742660 <i>I couldn't cry. So once again,</i>
742730 744820 <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>
755810 758280 <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>
758410 761820 <i>after we open our heart chakras,<br />when it's time to hug,</i>
761880 765050 <i>I'm gonna grab that bitch,<br />Marla Singer, and scream.</i>
765120 769120 Marla, you liar!<br />You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!
771230 773630 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>
773700 775560 <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>
775670 779100 <i>When you have insomnia,<br />you're never really asleep.</i>
779170 781660 <i>And you're never really awake.</i>
782840 785330 To begin tonight's communion,
785440 788140 Chloe would like to say a few words.
788280 791180 <i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>
792080 797040 <i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton<br />would look if you made it walk around</i>
797120 799180 <i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>
799690 801750 Well, I'm still here.
802130 804260 But I don't know for how long.
805100 808190 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
808300 810270 But I've got some good news.
810370 814100 I no longer have any fear of death.
818010 821780 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
822820 824910 No-one will have sex with me.
826090 830490 I'm so close to the end,<br />and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
831090 834550 I have pornographic movies<br />in my apartment,
834630 838330 - and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />- Thank you, Chloe.
839030 841160 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
841230 843400 Thank you, Chloe.
846210 850040 Now, let's ready ourselves<br />for guided meditation.
851180 854580 You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
855050 858540 You step inside your cave and you walk...
858620 861750 <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>
862790 864780 <i>Marla.</i>
864860 869320 <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth<br />that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>
869430 871520 <i>But you can't.</i>
872430 875270 <i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>
875370 878930 <i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>
881580 883640 <i>Now find your power animal.</i>
886550 888570 Slide.
892060 895490 OK. Let's partner up.
895590 897890 Pick someone special to you tonight.
904100 906190 Hey.
906600 908660 - We need to talk.<br />- Sure.
913480 915570 - I'm onto you.<br />- What?
915650 918770 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
918850 920650 Sorry?
920720 925710 In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath<br />sense of the word, I know we're all dying.
925820 930020 - But you're not dying the way Chloe is.<br />- So?
930630 932690 So you're a tourist.
932800 937000 I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,<br />I saw you at tuberculosis.
937070 939590 I saw you at testicular cancer!
939670 941300 I saw you practising this.
941410 943840 - Practising what?<br />- Telling me off.
943910 947740 Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?
947850 949640 I'll expose you.
949710 951810 Go ahead. I'll expose you.
952550 955420 Come together. Let yourselves cry.
962430 964520 Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
964630 967360 It's cheaper than a movie<br />and there's free coffee.
967470 970230 Look, this is important.<br />These are my groups.
970300 972430 I've been coming for over a year.
972540 975740 - Why do you do it?<br />- I don't know.
975840 979680 When people think you're dying,<br />they listen to you instead of...
979750 982740 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
984050 986110 Yeah. Yeah.
987290 990150 Share yourself... completely.
990960 993050 Look, you don't want to get into this.
993130 995190 - It becomes an addiction.<br />- Really?
995300 999560 I'm not kidding. I can't cry<br />if another faker is present, and I need this.
999670 1001730 You gotta find somewhere else to go.
1001800 1005360 Candystripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1008540 1010600 No, wait a second. Hold on.
1010710 1012770 We'll split up the week, OK?
1012880 1015070 You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1015150 1018280 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1018350 1021690 OK. Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1021760 1025690 Technically, I have more right to be there.<br />You still have your balls.
1025760 1028130 - You're kidding.<br />- I dunno. Am I?
1028800 1030230 No. No.
1030330 1032960 - What do you want?<br />- I'll take the parasites.
1033040 1035830 You can't have both.<br />Take the blood parasites.
1035940 1040240 - I want brain parasites.<br />- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.
1040340 1043110 - I want that.<br />- You can't have the whole brain.
1043180 1045700 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1045780 1049720 OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
1049790 1052050 Now we both have three...
1054790 1057420 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1073980 1076140 - What, are you selling those?<br />- Yes!
1076210 1078270 I'm selling some clothes!
1078380 1080440 So! We each have three. That's six.
1080550 1083380 What about the seventh day?<br />I want bowel cancer.
1083450 1085550 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>
1085660 1087750 No. No. I want bowel cancer.
1088390 1090450 That's your favorite too?
1090560 1094050 - Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />- Look, we'll split it.
1094170 1096220 Take the first and third Sunday.
1098700 1100570 Deal.
1103170 1105470 Looks like this is goodbye.
1105580 1107700 Let's not make a big thing out of it.
1107810 1110250 How's this for not making a big thing?
1113720 1115520 Hey, Marla!
1115850 1118020 Marla!
1118090 1120680 Maybe we should exchange numbers.
1120790 1122690 Should we?
1122800 1126860 - We might wanna switch nights.<br />- OK.
1132040 1134530 <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>
1136280 1140510 <i>Marla's philosophy of life<br />was that she might die at any moment.</i>
1140610 1142910 <i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>
1143020 1147040 It doesn't have your name!<br />Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?
1147120 1151080 Travis? Any of the stupid names<br />you give each night?
1154060 1156120 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>
1156230 1159170 <i>SFO. LAX.</i>
1159270 1161630 <i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>
1161740 1163860 <i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>
1163940 1165910 <i>BWI.</i>
1165970 1169770 <i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.<br />Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>
1169880 1173750 The check-in for that flight<br />isn't for another two hours, sir.
1173850 1177110 <i>This is your life,<br />and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>
1177190 1180180 <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>
1181590 1185460 <i>If you wake up at a different time,<br />in a different place,</i>
1185530 1188190 <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>
1188300 1190360 <i>Everywhere I travel,</i>
1190470 1192730 <i>tiny life.</i>
1192800 1195330 <i>Single-serving sugar and cream.</i>
1195400 1197200 <i>Single pat of butter.</i>
1197310 1200140 <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>
1200210 1202180 <i>Shampoo-conditioner combos.</i>
1202280 1206150 <i>Sample-package mouthwash.<br />Tiny bars of soap.</i>
1207580 1210110 <i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>
1210190 1212310 <i>they're single-serving friends.</i>
1212390 1216120 <i>Between takeoff and landing,<br />we have our time together.</i>
1216190 1218420 <i>That's all we get.</i>
1218530 1220430 <i>Welcome!</i>
1222530 1226730 <i>On a long enough time line,<br />the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>
1226800 1230540 <i>I was a recall coordinator.<br />My job was to apply the formula.</i>
1230610 1233010 The infant went through the windshield.
1233110 1237170 <i>A new car built by my company<br />leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>
1237250 1239340 <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>
1240380 1242980 The teenager's braces<br />are stuck to the ashtray.
1243050 1245420 Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
1245520 1249020 <i>The car crashes and burns<br />with everyone trapped inside.</i>
1249130 1251390 <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>
1251460 1253560 The father must have been huge.
1253630 1256860 See where the fat burned to the seat?<br />The polyester shirt?
1256970 1258960 Very modern art.
1259040 1261530 <i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>
1261610 1264340 <i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>
1264410 1268210 <i>Multiply the result by<br />the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>
1268280 1270370 <i>A x B x C</i>
1270580 1272480 equals X.
1272580 1275180 If X is less than the cost of a recall,
1275250 1277280 we don't do one.
1277390 1280590 Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
1280660 1282590 You wouldn't believe.
1284060 1286590 Which car company do you work for?
1286670 1288790 A major one.
1291270 1295210 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply<br />on takeoff or landing,</i>
1295270 1298570 <i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>
1299250 1300800 <i>Anything.</i>
1309660 1313390 <i>Life insurance pays off triple<br />if you die on a business trip.</i>
1316330 1319630 "If you are seated in an emergency exit row
1319700 1323230 and would be unable or unwilling<br />to perform the duties
1323300 1327740 listed on the safety card, please<br />ask a flight attendant to reseat you."
1329540 1331600 It's a lot of responsibility.
1331680 1333910 Wanna switch seats?
1334020 1337450 No. I'm not sure<br />I'm the man for that particularjob.
1337520 1341920 An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.
1342020 1344080 The illusion of safety.
1344330 1346420 Yeah. I guess so.
1346490 1349430 You know why<br />they put oxygen masks on planes?
1349500 1354060 - So you can breathe.<br />- Oxygen gets you high.
1355170 1358700 In a catastrophic emergency,<br />you take giant panic breaths.
1358770 1361300 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
1361380 1363680 You accept your fate.
1364310 1366340 It's all right here.
1366450 1369580 Emergency water landing, 600mph.
1369690 1372520 Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
1372590 1374680 That's...
1375930 1378190 That's an interesting theory.
1380200 1382320 - What do you do?<br />- What do you mean?
1382400 1384490 What do you do for a living?
1384570 1387730 Why? So you can pretend you're interested?
1390410 1391900 OK.
1391980 1394880 You have<br />a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
1398120 1400180 We have the exact same briefcase.
1401020 1403010 Soap.
1403120 1406790 - Sorry?<br />- I make and I sell soap.
1406930 1409290 The yardstick of civilization.
1409790 1411760 <i>And this is how I met...</i>
1411900 1413690 Tyler Durden.
1413770 1419030 Did you know if you mix gasoline and<br />frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?
1419140 1422110 - No, I did not. Is that true?<br />- That's right.
1422170 1426010 One can make all kinds of explosives<br />with simple household items.
1426110 1428550 - Really?<br />- If one was so inclined.
1433520 1438580 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting<br />single-serving friend I have ever met.
1440460 1444590 - Everything on a plane is single-serving...<br />- Oh, I get it. Very clever.
1444660 1446220 Thank you.
1446330 1448430 How's it working out for you?
1448540 1451270 - What?<br />- Being clever?
1451370 1453740 Great.
1453810 1456800 Keep it up, then. Right up.
1458010 1460170 A question of etiquette.
1460250 1463240 As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
1470290 1472620 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>
1472690 1476990 <i>Airlines have this policy<br />about vibrating luggage.</i>
1484670 1489300 - Was it ticking?<br />- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.
1489410 1492570 - Sorry, throwers?<br />- Baggage handlers.
1492650 1494880 But when a suitcase vibrates,
1495020 1497680 the throwers have got to call the police.
1497790 1501280 - My suitcase was vibrating?<br />- Nine times out of ten
1501390 1503450 it's an electric razor.
1503530 1505650 But... every once in a while
1508600 1510660 it's a dildo.
1511430 1515500 It's company policy never to imply<br />ownership in the event of a dildo.
1515610 1519470 <i>We have to use the indefinite article,<br />a dildo, never</i>
1519540 1521640 <i>your dildo.</i>
1521710 1523810 I don't own...
1526480 1529610 <i>I had everything in that suitcase.<br />My CK shirts.</i>
1529690 1532850 <i>My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.</i>
1534520 1536860 <i>Never mind.</i>
1538730 1541460 Hey! That's my car!
1547770 1549740 <i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>
1549840 1552870 <i>of a filing cabinet<br />for widows and professionals.</i>
1552940 1555570 <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>
1555680 1557740 <i>A foot of concrete is important</i>
1557850 1562120 <i>when your next-door neighbor<br />has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>
1562190 1566090 <i>Or when a blast of debris<br />that used to be your personal effects</i>
1566160 1570190 <i>blows out of your windows<br />and sails flaming into the night.</i>
1576670 1578930 <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>
1591790 1593880 There's... nothing up there.
1593950 1597360 You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
1606030 1608560 Do you have somebody you can call?
1608640 1610760 <i>How embarrassing.</i>
1610840 1613740 <i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>
1623180 1626950 <i>The police later told me<br />the pilot light might have gone out</i>
1627960 1630920 <i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>
1630990 1633260 <i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>
1633360 1636850 <i>1700 square feet with high ceilings<br />for days and days.</i>
1645070 1648840 <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor<br />could have clicked on.</i>
1649950 1652000 <i>Yeah?</i>
1655150 1657210 <i>I can hear you breathing...</i>
1665860 1669800 <i>If you ask me now,<br />I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>
1713040 1715280 <i>- Hello?<br />- Who's this?</i>
1717520 1719610 <i>- Tyler?<br />- Who is this?</i>
1721150 1723350 We met... We met on the airplane.
1723460 1725690 We had the same suitcase?
1725760 1727850 The clever guy?
1727930 1730290 <i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>
1732300 1734930 I called a second ago. There was no answer.
1735030 1739230 <i>- I'm at a payphone.<br />- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.</i>
1741970 1744070 <i>So what's up?</i>
1744740 1746770 Well.
1746880 1748940 You're not gonna believe this.
1751080 1753310 You know, it could be worse.
1753390 1757150 A woman could cut off your penis<br />while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
1757990 1761290 There's always that. I don't know.
1761360 1764490 When you buy furniture,<br />you tell yourself, that's it.
1764560 1766660 That's the last sofa I'll need.
1766730 1769530 Whatever happens,<br />that sofa problem is handled.
1769600 1773060 I had it all.<br />I had a stereo that was very decent.
1773170 1776700 A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
1776780 1778940 I was close to being complete.
1779010 1781570 - Shit, man. Now it's all gone.<br />- All gone.
1781680 1784410 All gone.
1785690 1787710 Do you know what a duvet is?
1787790 1790690 - A comforter.<br />- It's a blanket.
1790760 1794750 Just a blanket. Why do guys<br />like you and I know what a duvet is?
1794830 1798990 Is this essential to our survival<br />in the hunter-gatherer sense?
1799100 1800730 No.
1800800 1802790 What are we, then?
1802910 1805500 I dunno. Consumers.
1805570 1807630 Right. We're consumers.
1807740 1811010 We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
1811110 1815020 Murder, crime, poverty.<br />These things don't concern me.
1815120 1818550 What concerns me are celebrity magazines,
1818620 1820710 television with 500 channels,
1820790 1823450 some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.
1823560 1825620 Viagra. Olestra.
1825730 1828560 - Martha Stewart.<br />- Fuck Martha Stewart.
1828630 1832120 She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.<br />It's all going down.
1832240 1835970 So fuck off with your sofa units<br />and Strinne green stripe patterns.
1836040 1839370 I say never be complete.
1839440 1841470 I say stop being perfect.
1841580 1843600 I say let's evolve.
1843680 1845980 Let the chips fall where they may.
1848150 1850250 But that's me, and I could be wrong.
1850350 1852410 Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
1852490 1854980 It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...
1855060 1858830 You did lose a lot of versatile solutions<br />for modern living.
1858900 1861490 Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.
1864870 1868640 My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
1871080 1873200 What?
1873310 1876440 The things you own end up owning you.
1879790 1881840 Do what you like, man.
1882590 1885020 Oh, it's late.
1885090 1887820 - Hey, thanks for the beer.<br />- Yeah, man.
1887890 1889990 I should find a hotel.
1890730 1892820 What?
1892900 1894530 What?
1894630 1896690 - A hotel?<br />- Yeah.
1896800 1899860 - Just ask, man.<br />- What are you talking about?
1899940 1903710 Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer<br />and you still can't ask.
1904710 1906340 What?
1906450 1909070 You called me<br />because you needed a place to stay.
1909150 1912610 - Oh, hey. No, no, no.<br />- Yes, you did. So just ask.
1912690 1915250 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
1917060 1919320 Would... Would that be a problem?
1919430 1921490 Is it a problem for you to ask?
1922500 1924730 - Can I stay at your place?<br />- Yeah.
1926100 1928160 Thanks.
1932340 1935330 - I want you to do me a favor.<br />- Yeah, sure.
1935440 1937840 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1937910 1939880 What?
1939950 1943780 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1943890 1946790 <i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>
1946990 1949350 <i>Tyler was a night person.</i>
1949460 1951690 While the rest of us slept, he worked.
1951760 1954920 He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
1955000 1957990 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.<br />It comes on a few.
1958100 1961800 Someone has to switch the projectors<br />at the exact moment
1961900 1965140 that one reel ends and the next one begins.
1965210 1969140 You can see little dots come into<br />the upper right corner of the screen.
1969210 1971940 In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.
1972020 1974110 That's the cue for a changeover.
1974180 1978950 He flips the projectors, movie keeps<br />going and the audience has no idea.
1979020 1981290 Why would anyone want this shitjob?
1981390 1984550 Because it affords him<br />interesting opportunities.
1984630 1988160 Like splicing a frame of pornography<br />into family films.
1988230 1993230 So when the snooty cat and the courageous<br />dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
1993370 1997570 that's when you'll catch a flash<br />of Tyler's contribution to the film.
2004450 2007040 Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.
2007150 2009710 Nice, big cock.
2014530 2017260 Even a hummingbird<br />couldn't catch Tyler at work.
2022600 2027630 Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet<br />waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.
2032280 2036340 <i>He was the guerrilla terrorist<br />of the food service industry.</i>
2036450 2038750 Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
2038820 2043220 Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,<br />he farted on meringues,
2043290 2045850 and as for the cream of mushroom soup...
2045960 2047980 Go ahead, tell 'em.
2048060 2050050 You get the idea.
2050260 2053500 - You just want me to hit you?<br />- Come on. Do me this one favor.
2053600 2056970 - Why?<br />- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
2057040 2061030 - No. But that's a good thing.<br />- You can't know yourself if you haven't!
2061110 2063470 I don't wanna die without any scars.
2063580 2067840 - Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.<br />- Oh, God. This is crazy.
2067920 2070210 So go crazy! Let it rip.
2070280 2072980 - I don't know about this.<br />- I don't either.
2073050 2076110 Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.<br />What do you care?
2076220 2078690 This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!
2078790 2080850 That's right.
2080930 2084130 - Where? Like, in the face?<br />- Surprise me.
2086300 2088390 This is so fucking stupid.
2099280 2101480 Motherfucker!
2101550 2103640 He hit me in the ear!
2103720 2106920 - Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.<br />- Ow, Christ!
2107020 2109080 - Why the ear, man?<br />- I fucked it up.
2109160 2110890 No, that was perfect.
2123770 2125900 No, it's all right.
2126740 2128840 It really hurts.
2129280 2131340 Right.
2131720 2133910 Hit me again.
2133980 2136110 No, you hit me. Come on!
2153070 2155560 We should do this again sometime.
2168350 2170580 - Where's your car?<br />- What car?
2181100 2183430 <i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>
2183570 2185800 <i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>
2185910 2188770 <i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>
2188840 2191240 <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>
2191340 2196710 <i>There was no lock on the front door from<br />when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>
2196780 2198840 <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>
2198950 2201440 <i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>
2201590 2204060 <i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>
2204960 2207020 Yep. That's you.
2207130 2209720 That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
2209800 2211860 Yeah, thanks.
2211970 2213870 <i>What a shithole.</i>
2213970 2215940 <i>Nothing worked.</i>
2219570 2223480 <i>Turning on one light meant<br />another light in the house went out.</i>
2223610 2227340 <i>There were no neighbors.<br />Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>
2227410 2231410 <i>That fart smell of steam.<br />The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>
2233190 2235590 What have we here?
2250370 2252470 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hey.
2263450 2266510 <i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>
2267420 2270820 <i>By the end of the first month,<br />I didn't miss TV.</i>
2271860 2275200 <i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>
2287540 2289670 Can I be next?
2294080 2296140 All right, man.
2296250 2298240 Lose the tie.
2302260 2306660 <i>At night, Tyler and I were alone<br />for half a mile in every direction.</i>
2312100 2316040 <i>Rain trickled down through<br />the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>
2316110 2318940 <i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>
2319040 2322240 <i>Everywhere were rusted nails<br />to snag your elbow on.</i>
2322310 2324910 <i>The previous occupant had been a shut-in.</i>
2324980 2327080 Hey, man. What are you reading?
2327150 2331520 Listen to this. It's an article written<br />by an organ in the first person.
2331590 2334350 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata.<br />Without me,
2334460 2337920 Jack could not regulate<br />his heart rate or breathing."
2338000 2340090 There's a whole series of these.
2340170 2342260 "I Am Jill's Nipples."
2344270 2348260 - "I Am Jack's Colon."<br />- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
2351510 2355310 <i>After fighting, everything else<br />in life got the volume turned down.</i>
2357320 2359010 What?
2359120 2362680 <i>- You could deal with anything.<br />- Have you finished those reports?</i>
2367330 2369920 <i>If you could choose,<br />who would you fight?</i>
2370000 2372090 I'd fight my boss, probably.
2372170 2374290 Really?
2374370 2377740 - Yeah, why? Who would you fight?<br />- I'd fight my dad.
2377810 2379900 I don't know my dad.
2379970 2381910 I mean, I know him, but...
2381980 2384340 He left when I was like, six years old.
2384410 2387400 Married this other woman<br />and had some other kids.
2387520 2389570 He did this every six years.
2389720 2393810 - He changes city and starts a new family.<br />- Fucker's setting up franchises!
2394620 2396750 My dad never went to college.
2396820 2400760 - So it was real important that I go.<br />- That sounds familiar.
2400830 2405270 So I graduate. Call him up long-distance<br />and say, "Dad, now what?"
2405370 2407360 - He says, "Get ajob."<br />- Same here.
2407440 2410130 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
2410210 2412200 "Dad, now what?"
2412270 2414400 He says, "I dunno. Get married."
2414480 2417970 You can't get married.
2418750 2420810 I'm a 30-year-old boy.
2420880 2423370 We're a generation of men raised by women.
2423450 2427750 I'm wondering if another woman<br />is really the answer we need.
2433760 2436960 <i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>
2437840 2441270 <i>But every Saturday night,<br />we were finding something out.</i>
2442470 2445960 <i>We were finding out more and more<br />that we were not alone.</i>
2449880 2454510 <i>It used to be that when I came home angry<br />or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>
2454620 2456680 <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>
2456820 2461850 <i>I should have been looking for a new condo<br />or haggling with my insurance company.</i>
2461930 2465690 <i>I should have been upset<br />about my nice flaming little shit.</i>
2465830 2467700 <i>But I wasn't.</i>
2467830 2471460 The premise of cybernetting an office<br />is make things more efficient.
2471540 2474400 <i>Monday mornings,<br />I just thought about next week.</i>
2474470 2477500 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
2477610 2478700 Absolutely.
2478840 2482080 Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
2482210 2485010 Because waste is a thief.
2485080 2488210 I showed this to my man here.<br />You liked it, didn't you?
2491890 2495830 <i>You can swallow a pint of blood<br />before you get sick.</i>
2496860 2499090 <i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>
2499160 2501330 <i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>
2501430 2503870 <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>
2503940 2506030 <i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>
2517250 2519310 Come on, you've gotta go home!
2541540 2543870 Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
2564770 2568500 <i>Every week,<br />Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>
2568570 2570630 Gentlemen!
2571410 2573500 Welcome to Fight Club.
2575610 2577770 The first rule of Fight Club is
2577910 2580250 you do not talk about Fight Club.
2580350 2582950 The second rule of Fight Club is
2583350 2586790 you do not talk about Fight Club!
2586920 2589190 Third rule of Fight Club.
2589260 2592060 Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
2592160 2594930 the fight is over. Fourth rule.
2595000 2597330 Only two guys to a fight.
2597400 2599270 Fifth rule.
2599370 2602030 One fight at a time, fellas.
2602140 2604610 Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.
2604680 2608610 Seventh rule.<br />Fights will go on as long as they have to.
2610450 2613040 And the eighth and final rule.
2614190 2617380 If this is your first night at Fight Club
2617450 2619550 you have to fight.
2623600 2625660 <i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>
2625770 2630260 <i>couldn't remember whether<br />you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>
2630370 2632770 <i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>
2632840 2636210 <i>when he trounced<br />the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>
2638080 2643410 <i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,<br />hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>
2647190 2650210 <i>Or the wet choke<br />when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>
2650290 2652310 Stop!
2652430 2655290 <i>You weren't alive anywhere<br />like you were there.</i>
2655400 2660200 <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours<br />between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>
2660700 2663730 <i>Even if I could tell someone<br />they had a good fight,</i>
2663840 2666140 <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>
2666240 2669540 <i>Who you were in Fight Club<br />is not who you were outside of it.</i>
2669640 2674670 <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.<br />His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>
2674750 2677620 <i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>
2678450 2681650 If you could fight any celebrity,<br />who would you fight?
2681720 2684850 - Alive or dead?<br />- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2685760 2688890 Hemingway. You?
2689530 2692690 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2693730 2696970 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>
2698240 2701570 <i>Everywhere we went,<br />we were sizing things up.</i>
2704910 2708080 <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>
2708150 2712250 <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein<br />or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>
2712320 2714450 Is that what a man looks like?
2715360 2718190 Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.
2718290 2720350 Now, self-destruction...
2720460 2722450 Excuse me.
2757100 2760300 <i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>
2760370 2762430 <i>It wasn't about words.</i>
2764380 2767830 <i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>
2767950 2769910 <i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>
2774450 2776550 - Is that it?<br />- Stop!
2776620 2779520 <i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>
2779590 2781530 <i>But nothing mattered.</i>
2781590 2784390 Cool.
2784460 2787260 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>
2788200 2790470 Hey, man. How about next week?
2790570 2792630 How about next month?!
2792740 2794800 Irvine, you're in the middle.
2794870 2796930 New guy, you too.
2798680 2800840 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>
2800950 2803040 He fell down some stairs.
2803680 2805780 I fell down some stairs.
2807620 2812290 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut<br />your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>
2812390 2814860 OK. Any historical figure.
2814960 2816830 I'd fight Gandhi.
2817460 2819300 Good answer.
2819400 2821630 - How about you?<br />- Lincoln.
2821700 2824300 Lincoln?
2824400 2828000 Big guy, big reach.<br />Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
2828880 2830970 Fuck!
2832180 2834840 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
2843930 2845320 Hello?
2845430 2847830 <i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>
2847900 2849230 <i>Marla?</i>
2852200 2855330 <i>- How did you find me?<br />- You left a forwarding number.</i>
2855440 2858430 I haven't seen you at any support groups.
2858510 2861700 <i>We split 'em up.<br />That was the idea. Remember?</i>
2861810 2864640 Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
2864710 2868240 - How do you know?<br />- I cheated.
2868320 2870150 I found a new one.
2870690 2872950 - Really?<br />- It's for men only.
2873060 2874650 Like the testicle thing?
2878430 2880450 Look, this is a bad time.
2880530 2882960 I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
2883070 2886630 <i>- They're really fucked-up people...<br />- I'm on my way out.</i>
2886700 2889070 Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
2889170 2891470 I took what was left of a bottle.
2891540 2893630 It might have been too much.
2893710 2897340 <i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself<br />around her crummy apartment.</i>
2897480 2901940 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.<br />This is probably a cry-for-help thing.
2902050 2904950 So you're staying in tonight, then?
2905060 2907890 Do you wanna wait<br />and hear me describe death?
2907960 2912490 <i>Do you wanna listen<br />and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>
2914730 2917390 <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>
2943700 2948530 <i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for<br />two months and his door was never closed.</i>
2953540 2956600 You won't believe this dream<br />I had last night.
2956710 2959970 I can hardly believe anything about last night.
2969790 2971760 What are you doing here?
2974460 2976550 What?
2976630 2979060 This is my house.<br />What are you doing here?
2981470 2983460 Fuck you!
2998090 3001450 Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
3001560 3003550 Limber, though.
3003630 3005620 Silly cooze.
3006690 3009430 I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
3009500 3011590 Guess who's on the other end?
3011670 3013860 <i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>
3016170 3019770 <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>
3019840 3022680 Do you think it'll live up to its name?
3022780 3026370 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>
3029790 3033780 <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>
3033860 3035480 <i>Ten,</i>
3035590 3038390 <i>nine,... eight...</i>
3038460 3040690 <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>
3040800 3044670 <i>think it was a bad thing<br />that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>
3044730 3046400 <i>Five,</i>
3046470 3048060 <i>four...</i>
3048840 3050900 Hang on.
3056350 3058680 You got here fast.
3060220 3062310 Did I call you?
3073030 3076130 The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
3079370 3081770 Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
3084580 3086480 Oh, fuck!
3086550 3088640 Somebody called the cops.
3100560 3104050 - Hey, where's 513?<br />- End of the hall.
3104860 3108730 The girl who lives there<br />used to be a charming, lovely girl.
3108800 3110960 She has lost faith in herself.
3111070 3113900 - Miss Singer, let us help you!<br />- She's a monster!
3113970 3118100 - You have every reason to live.<br />- She's infectious human waste!
3118180 3121980 - Miss Singer!<br />- Good luck trying to save her!
3126790 3128980 If I fall asleep,
3129090 3131350 I'm done for.
3133330 3135520 You're gonna have to keep me up
3135600 3137690 all night.
3137770 3140100 Un-fucking-believable.
3140170 3142360 <i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>
3142440 3146130 - You know what I mean, you fucked her.<br />- No, I didn't.
3146210 3148330 - Never?<br />- No.
3149240 3151370 You're not into her, are you?
3151450 3153540 No! God, not at all.
3153610 3156210 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>
3156350 3158250 Are you sure? You can tell me.
3158390 3160220 Believe me, I'm sure.
3160360 3163620 <i>- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.<br />- That's good.</i>
3163730 3166460 She's a predator posing as a house pet.<br />Stay away.
3168430 3172060 The shit that came out of<br />this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
3172170 3173830 My God.
3173940 3177270 I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.
3177410 3179840 <i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>
3179940 3183470 <i>The other night,<br />he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>
3183580 3186380 Marla doesn't need a lover,<br />just a caseworker.
3186450 3189040 Or a wash.<br />This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
3189150 3192020 <i>She invaded my support groups<br />and now my home.</i>
3192090 3194180 Hey, hey. Sit down.
3198260 3201700 Now, listen.<br />I can't have you talking to her about me.
3201800 3203630 Why would I...
3203700 3209070 Say anything about me or what goes on<br />in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.
3209170 3211830 - Now promise me. You promise?<br />- OK.
3211910 3214040 - Yeah, I promise.<br />- Promise?
3214110 3217510 - I just said, I promise! What...<br />- That's three times you promised.
3219020 3223010 <i>If only I had wasted a few minutes<br />and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>
3223090 3225180 <i>none of this would have happened.</i>
3230100 3233030 Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!
3239640 3242110 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>
3243240 3247080 <i>On the third floor<br />where I might not have heard them.</i>
3247150 3249240 <i>But I didn't.</i>
3273470 3277570 - What are you doing?<br />- Just going to bed.
3277680 3279740 Wanna finish her off?
3282650 3286180 - No. No, thank you.<br />- I've found a cigarette.
3286290 3289650 - Who were you talking to?<br />- Shut up.
3289720 3292990 <i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>
3293660 3295720 <i>I was the Zen master.</i>
3300870 3302860 <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>
3303510 3305800 <i>I e-mailed them to everyone.</i>
3305910 3308000 Is that your blood?
3309710 3311770 Some of it, yeah.
3311880 3314540 You can't smoke in here.
3314620 3316710 Take the rest of the day off.
3316790 3319310 Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
3319390 3321510 Get yourself together.
3321890 3324220 <i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>
3324330 3326820 <i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>
3326930 3328990 <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."</i>
3329100 3330960 <i>"I am enlightened."</i>
3332900 3338030 <i>You give up the condo life, give up<br />all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>
3338140 3341200 <i>move to a dilapidated house<br />in a toxic waste area,</i>
3341310 3345180 <i>and you have to come home to this.</i>
3355830 3359230 <i>- Hello.<br />- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>
3359330 3363560 <i>We have some new information about<br />the incident at your former condo.</i>
3363630 3364930 Yes.
3365000 3369940 I don't know if you're aware, but someone<br />sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.
3370010 3372670 <i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>
3372780 3374770 No, I wasn't aware of that.
3374850 3376840 <i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>
3376950 3379210 Does this sound strange to you?
3379280 3382150 <i>Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.</i>
3382220 3384250 <i>- The dynamite<br />- Dynamite?</i>
3384360 3387450 left a residue<br />of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
3387590 3391030 <i>- Do you know what this means?<br />- No, what does it mean?</i>
3391100 3393030 It means it was home-made.
3393100 3397360 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3397440 3403000 Whoever set this dynamite could have blown<br />out your pilot light days before the explosion.
3403080 3406170 <i>- The gas was just a detonator.<br />- Who would go and do that?</i>
3406250 3408300 <i>- I'll ask the questions.<br />- Tell him.</i>
3408450 3412850 Tell him the liberator who destroyed<br />my property realigned my perceptions.
3412920 3415010 <i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>
3415090 3418020 I am listening.<br />It's hard to know what to make of this.
3418090 3422590 Have you recently made enemies who might<br />have access to home-made dynamite?
3422660 3424930 - Enemies?<br />- Reject civilization,
3425030 3427090 especially material possessions.
3427200 3430070 <i>- Son, this is serious.<br />- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>
3430140 3432730 <i>- I mean that.<br />- Yes, it's very serious.</i>
3432840 3435670 Look, nobody takes this<br />more seriously than me.
3435740 3438470 That condo was my life. OK?
3438610 3442110 I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
3442220 3445240 <i>That was not just a bunch of stuff<br />that got destroyed.</i>
3445320 3448220 <i>- It was me!<br />- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>
3448290 3452320 <i>- Is this not a good time for you?<br />- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>
3452430 3456300 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3456370 3461270 <i>- Are you still there?<br />- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>
3461340 3465330 No. I may need to talk to you, so you<br />let me know if you're gonna leave town.
3465440 3467840 <i>- OK?<br />- OK.</i>
3470510 3475140 <i>Except for their humping,<br />Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>
3475250 3478310 <i>My parents pulled this exact same act<br />for years.</i>
3478390 3482150 The condom is the glass slipper<br />of our generation.
3482260 3485160 You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
3485260 3487320 You... dance all night.
3487400 3489490 Then you throw it away.
3489730 3492360 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3493900 3495370 What?
3500210 3503010 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
3503110 3504980 It was worth every penny.
3505080 3507140 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3508120 3511320 Someone loved it intensely
3511390 3513410 for one day.
3513520 3515620 Then tossed it.
3517490 3519550 Like a Christmas tree.
3519700 3521790 So special.
3521900 3523330 Then
3523400 3525200 bam!
3525300 3527360 It's on the side of the road.
3527940 3530030 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3532110 3534170 Like a sex crime victim.
3534250 3536340 Underwear inside out.
3537020 3540850 - Bound with electrical tape.<br />- Well then, it suits you.
3540950 3543650 You can borrow it sometime.
3550660 3552760 Get rid of her.
3553530 3556430 <i>- What? You get rid of her!<br />- Don't mention me.</i>
3556540 3560730 <i>I am six years old again,<br />passing messages between parents.</i>
3562740 3566340 - I really think it's time you left.<br />- Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3566410 3571040 - Not that we don't love your visits.<br />- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
3573220 3576090 Gotta get off
3576190 3577450 Thanks. Bye.
3577560 3583500 Gotta get off of this merry-go-round
3584260 3588100 Gonna get, need to get...
3588200 3590230 Gotta get...
3592440 3593870 You kids!
3595880 3598370 Why do you still waste time with her?
3598450 3600780 I'll say this about Marla.
3600850 3603110 <i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>
3603220 3604510 And I'm not?
3604620 3607450 Feathers up your butt<br />do not make you a chicken.
3607520 3609620 What are we doing tonight?
3610290 3612520 Tonight... we make soap.
3613500 3614620 Really?
3614730 3617560 To make soap, first we render fat.
3636450 3638680 The salt balance has to be just right
3638820 3641310 so the best fat for soap comes from humans.
3642130 3645220 - Wait, what is this place?<br />- A liposuction clinic.
3653300 3655330 Pay dirt!
3655440 3659270 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />Fat of the land!
3664880 3668440 No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!
3673060 3675320 - Oh, God!<br />- Give me another one.
3681470 3684920 As the fat renders,<br />the tallows float to the surface.
3685000 3687100 Like in Boy Scouts.
3687170 3690970 - It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.<br />- Keep stirring.
3693310 3696870 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerin.
3696950 3699350 Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.
3699420 3703290 Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,<br />you've got dynamite.
3703360 3707190 Yeah, with enough soap,<br />one could blow up just about anything.
3707290 3709350 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>
3709430 3713390 People found clothes got cleaner<br />when washed at a certain point in the river.
3713500 3715520 - You know why?<br />- No.
3718370 3722170 Human sacrifices were once made<br />on the hills above this river.
3722240 3725440 Bodies burnt.<br />Water permeated the ashes to create lye.
3725550 3727980 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3728050 3732850 Once it mixed with the melted body fat,<br />a white soapy discharge crept into the river.
3732950 3735010 May I see your hand, please?
3740390 3743630 What is this?
3743730 3746320 This is a chemical burn.
3746400 3749930 It will hurt more than any burn<br />and it will leave a scar.
3750000 3752630 <i>Meditation worked for cancer,<br />it could work now.</i>
3753440 3756210 - Don't shut the pain out.<br />- Oh, God!
3757010 3761450 The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,<br />like the first monkey shot into space.
3761550 3764540 Without pain or sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3764620 3767560 <i>I tried not to think<br />of the word searing of flesh.</i>
3767620 3770790 Stop it!<br />This is your pain, this is your burning hand.
3770890 3773560 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3773630 3777660 No! Don't deal with this<br />the way those dead people do! Come on!
3777770 3781760 - I get the point!<br />- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
3784570 3788640 It's the greatest moment of your life,<br />and you're off somewhere else!
3788710 3790240 I am not!
3790310 3793300 Shut up!<br />Our fathers were our models for God.
3793420 3796580 If our fathers bailed,<br />what does that tell you about God?
3797590 3802820 Listen to me. You have to consider<br />the possibility that God does not like you.
3802930 3807020 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, He hates you.
3807100 3810660 This is not the worst thing that can happen.<br />We don't need Him!
3810740 3813700 - I agree!<br />- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
3813800 3816300 We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
3816410 3820900 - I'm getting water!<br />- You can use water and make it worse or...
3822050 3825540 - Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />- Please let me up!
3825650 3827710 First, you have to give up.
3827820 3830520 First, you have to know, not fear,
3830620 3833610 know that some day, you're gonna die.
3833690 3835920 You don't know how this feels!
3839870 3844170 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3846170 3848260 OK.
3861520 3863550 Congratulations.
3863660 3866560 You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.
3869600 3872660 <i>Tyler sold his soap<br />to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>
3872730 3874720 <i>God knows what they charged.</i>
3874800 3878070 - This is the best soap.<br />- Why, thank you, Susan.
3878140 3880200 <i>It was beautiful.</i>
3880310 3884180 <i>We were selling rich women<br />their own fat asses back to them.</i>
3885180 3887270 <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>
3887350 3889610 <i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>
3889720 3893350 "The first rule of Fight Club<br />is don't talk about Fight Club."
3893420 3896980 <i>I'm half-asleep again.<br />I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>
3897090 3899560 "The second rule..." Is this yours?
3901430 3904990 Pretend you're me.<br />Make a managerial decision.
3905100 3907530 You find this. What would you do?
3912170 3914160 Well, I gotta tell you,
3914240 3917910 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3918010 3921310 Because the person who wrote that<br />is dangerous.
3921380 3925840 And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho<br />might just snap
3925990 3928820 and then stalk from office to office
3928920 3933990 with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered<br />semiautomatic weapon,
3934060 3938520 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3939200 3942570 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.
3942640 3945770 Someone very, very close to you.
3945840 3949240 <i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>
3950250 3952340 <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>
3952420 3955750 Or maybe you shouldn't bring me<br />every piece of trash you pick up.
3959590 3963250 - Compliance and Liability.<br />- My tit's gonna rot off.
3964200 3966750 Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
3973040 3976670 - What do you mean?<br />- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
3976770 3980710 - Go to a hospital.<br />- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
3981680 3983870 I don't know about this, Marla.
3983980 3985680 Please.
3985780 3989780 <i>She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.</i>
3991820 3995850 That's nice.<br />Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.
3995930 3998060 Where are they, exactly?
3998130 4002260 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4002330 4004430 - No, no.<br />- I got one for you.
4004500 4006600 Thanks for the thought.
4007940 4010270 What happened to your hand?
4010340 4012500 Oh, nothing.
4012610 4014670 Right there?
4015720 4018410 - Feel anything?<br />- No.
4018520 4020510 Well, make sure.
4020620 4022650 OK, I'm pretty sure.
4022720 4024710 You feel nothing?
4024820 4027120 No, nothing.
4028660 4031490 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
4033100 4036300 - No problem.<br />- I wish I could return the favor.
4036370 4038460 Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
4038540 4042030 - I could check your prostate.<br />- I think I'm OK.
4042140 4044240 Well, thanks, anyway.
4049250 4051550 - Are we done?<br />- Yeah, we're done.
4051650 4053850 See you... around.
4071060 4073190 Cornelius?
4073270 4075630 Cornelius!
4075740 4078430 It's me! Bob!
4078540 4079970 Hey, Bob.
4083540 4086540 - We all thought you were dead.<br />- No, no. Still here.
4086610 4090640 - How are you, Bob?<br />- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.
4090750 4094240 - Really? Still remaining men together?<br />- No, no.
4094360 4098090 - I got something so much better now.<br />- Really, what is it?
4098760 4100620 Well...
4100700 4104960 The first rule is,<br />I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4105070 4107190 And the second rule is
4107270 4109570 I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4109640 4113070 - And the third rule is...<br />- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
4113210 4115270 Look at my face, Bob.
4117680 4120010 That's fucking... fucking great.
4120080 4123810 - I've never seen you there.<br />- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4123890 4127620 - I go Saturday.<br />- Congratulations.
4128020 4130390 Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?
4130460 4133090 Have you heard about the guy<br />that invented it?
4133230 4136100 - Yeah, actually...<br />- I hear all kinds of things.
4136230 4139830 Supposedly,<br />he was born in a mental institution
4139900 4143300 and he sleeps only one hour a night.
4143410 4145600 He's a great man.
4147080 4149410 Do you know about Tyler Durden?
4174370 4176470 I didn't hurt you, did I?
4176540 4178630 Actually, you did.
4178710 4180770 Thank you for this.
4181050 4183450 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4183520 4185570 <i>Fight Club.</i>
4185680 4187780 <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>
4187990 4189950 <i>Our gift to the world.</i>
4190060 4193390 I look around, I look around,<br />I see a lot of new faces.
4194990 4197190 Shut up!
4197330 4202170 Which means a lot of people have been<br />breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
4210510 4214570 I see in Fight Club the strongest<br />and smartest men who've ever lived.
4214680 4216740 I see all this potential.
4216820 4218910 And I see it squandered.
4219920 4223010 Goddamn it,<br />an entire generation pumping gas.
4223590 4225680 Waiting tables.
4225760 4227820 Slaves with white collars.
4230330 4233390 Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.
4233500 4236770 Working jobs we hate<br />so we can buy shit we don't need.
4240640 4243110 We're the middle children of history.
4243180 4245240 No purpose or place.
4245450 4247540 We have no Great War.
4247850 4249940 No Great Depression.
4251720 4254050 Our great war is a spiritual war.
4254520 4257860 Our great depression is our lives.
4260730 4263790 We've all been raised<br />on television to believe
4263870 4267560 that one day we'd be millionaires<br />and movie gods and rock stars.
4267640 4269730 But we won't.
4269810 4272240 We're slowly learning that fact.
4272380 4274810 And we're very, very pissed off.
4274880 4276540 Yeah!
4279450 4283890 - First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
4289390 4290650 Who are you?
4291490 4294090 - Who am I?<br />- Yeah.
4295000 4297830 There's a sign on the front<br />that says Lou's Tavern.
4298900 4302810 I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
4302870 4304970 Tyler Durden.
4308080 4311570 Who told you motherfuckers<br />that you could use my place?
4311650 4314020 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
4314090 4316680 Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
4316790 4318910 He don't own this place. I do.
4321090 4324590 - How much money's he getting for this?<br />- There is no money.
4324660 4327460 - Free to all.<br />- Ain't that something?
4327530 4329400 It is, actually.
4329470 4331900 Look, stupid fuck!
4332000 4334530 - I want everybody out of here right now.<br />- Hey!
4334640 4336870 You should join our club.
4337240 4339230 Did you hear what I just said?
4339310 4341440 You and your friend.
4343320 4345440 You hear me now?
4347650 4349710 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
4355860 4357850 Still not getting it.
4358900 4361060 OK, OK, I got it.
4361130 4363630 I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
4364670 4366540 Back! All of you!
4368240 4370300 Everybody back!
4377780 4379950 Ah, Lou!
4380050 4383720 Come on, man!<br />We really like this place.
4392770 4395700 - That's right, Lou. Get it out.<br />- Shut the fuck up.
4395800 4397600 Oh, yeah!
4402580 4404670 Is that fucking funny?
4414220 4416820 Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.
4417690 4419350 Unbelievable.
4423600 4426570 - You don't know where I've been, Lou.<br />- Oh, my God!
4426640 4429540 You don't know where I've been!
4432610 4435700 Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
4435780 4438210 Fucking use the basement! Christ!
4438310 4441180 I want your word, Lou! I want your word!
4441250 4443240 On my mother's eyes.
4452400 4454520 Thanks, Lou.
4455830 4457930 You too, big guy.
4461870 4463970 We'll see you next week.
4479460 4483050 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4483160 4488000 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4491240 4493400 You're gonna start a fight
4493510 4495600 and you're gonna lose.
4497580 4499510 Excellent choice, sir.
4502080 4505380 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4505780 4508410 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>
4511120 4513090 Son of a bitch!
4513190 4517930 <i>Most people, normal people,<br />do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>
4518870 4520930 Excuse me!
4521040 4524730 You sprayed me with your hose.<br />That's not necessary...
4524840 4526740 Jay! Go call 911!
4529480 4531540 Put the hose down.
4531650 4533700 Stop it! Stop it!
4535350 4537250 Sorry.
4552770 4555240 We need to talk.
4557470 4559570 OK.
4559670 4561730 Where to begin?
4561840 4564040 With your constant absenteeism?
4564110 4566670 With your unpresentable appearance?
4566750 4568770 You're up for review.
4568880 4572080 I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4572150 4574090 - What?<br />- Let's pretend.
4574160 4577060 You're the Department of Transportation,<br />OK?
4577130 4580790 Someone informs you that this company
4580900 4584960 installs front-seat mounting brackets<br />that failed collision tests,
4585070 4588470 brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
4588540 4592970 and fuel injectors<br />that explode and burn people alive.
4593080 4594940 What then?
4595010 4597310 Are you threatening me?
4597380 4600180 - No...<br />- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
4600280 4604720 I have a better solution. Keep me<br />on the payroll as an outside consultant.
4604790 4606880 In exchange for my salary,
4606960 4610790 my job will be never to tell people<br />these things that I know.
4610900 4615160 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4616430 4620560 Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,<br />you crazy little shit?
4625840 4629370 <i>- Security!<br />- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>
4638360 4640450 What the hell are you doing?
4649670 4651760 That hurt.
4653210 4655270 Why would you do that?
4655940 4658930 Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
4668290 4670380 What are you doing?
4671460 4673550 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4673630 4677760 <i>For some reason,<br />I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>
4677830 4679420 No!
4703860 4708320 <i>Under and behind and inside<br />everything this man took for granted,</i>
4708430 4711890 <i>something horrible had been growing.</i>
4712000 4713060 Look.
4713130 4717870 Give me the paychecks, like I asked,<br />and you won't ever see me again.
4717940 4720740 <i>Then, at our most excellent<br />moment together...</i>
4723810 4726540 Thank God!<br />Please don't hit me again.
4726650 4728740 <i>Telephone, computer,</i>
4728850 4734020 <i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks<br />and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>
4734090 4736490 <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>
4736560 4741730 <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have<br />Fight Club every night of the week.</i>
4744370 4747960 <i>Now, the center of Fight Club<br />became the two men fighting.</i>
4748070 4751530 <i>The leader walked through the crowd,<br />out in the darkness.</i>
4753310 4757840 <i>Tyler was now involved in<br />a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>
4757920 4760180 <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>
4765360 4768350 <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>
4776100 4778160 Thank you, sir.
4779670 4782660 <i>Tyler dreamed up<br />new homework assignments.</i>
4782770 4785300 <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>
4824450 4828150 - There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.<br />- Yeah, I heard.
4829960 4832150 There's one in Penns Grove too.
4832230 4834460 Bob even found one up in New Castle.
4834560 4837620 - Did you start that one?<br />- No, I thought you did.
4837730 4840220 No.
4889090 4891280 - Stop for a second.<br />- Hey, what are we doing?
4891390 4893410 - Turn around.<br />- What are we doing?
4893490 4895920 - Homework assignment.<br />- What kind?
4896030 4898050 Human sacrifice.
4898130 4901460 - Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.<br />- It's a gun.
4901530 4903900 - What are you doing?<br />- Meet me in the back.
4904000 4906330 - Don't fuck around!<br />- Meet me in the back.
4906440 4908230 <i>On a long enough time line,</i>
4908310 4911210 <i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>
4912210 4914270 What are you doing? Come on!
4914340 4917750 Hands behind your back.<br />Give me your wallet.
4919520 4922820 Raymond K Hessel.<br />1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.
4923620 4926820 - Small, cramped basement apartment?<br />- How did you know?
4926930 4929520 They give shitty apartments letters.
4929630 4932720 Raymond! You're going to die.
4932830 4934300 No!
4934370 4938530 Is that your mom and dad?<br />They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.
4938640 4940900 Pick up your dental records. Know why?
4940970 4944530 - There'll be nothing left of your face.<br />- Oh, come on!
4944640 4948550 An expired community college student ID.<br />What did you study, Raymond?
4948650 4951670 - S... S... Stuff.<br />- Stuff?
4951750 4953840 Were the midterms hard?
4954990 4957550 - I asked you what you studied!<br />- Biology, mostly.
4957660 4961150 - Why?<br />- I don't know.
4961260 4964250 What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!
4965660 4969600 The question, Raymond,<br />was what did you want to be?
4971300 4973360 Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!
4973470 4975870 - Veterinarian. Veterinarian.<br />- Animals.
4975980 4978950 - Yeah. Animals and stuff.<br />- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
4979010 4981570 - So you need more schooling.<br />- Too much school.
4981680 4984150 - Would you rather be dead?<br />- No, please...
4984220 4988680 You'd rather die here, on your knees,<br />in the back of a convenience store?
4988760 4990380 Please, no.
4994500 4996550 I'm keeping your license.
4997800 5000790 Gonna check in on you.<br />I know where you live.
5000900 5003890 If you're not working<br />to be a veterinarian in six weeks,
5004010 5006100 you will be dead.
5007980 5010030 Now run on home.
5014780 5016840 Run, Forrest, run!
5018520 5020580 I feel ill.
5021390 5023450 Imagine how he feels.
5023560 5025620 Come on, this isn't funny!
5025730 5028160 What the fuck was the point of that?!
5028230 5032360 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day<br />of Raymond K Hessel's life.
5032430 5036800 His breakfast will taste better<br />than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
5038240 5040330 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>
5040410 5042780 <i>- Come on.<br />- He had a plan.</i>
5042850 5046280 <i>And it started to make sense<br />in a Tyler-sort of way.</i>
5046380 5048280 <i>No fear. No distractions.</i>
5048380 5051680 <i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>
5051790 5053780 <i>truly slide.</i>
5067200 5069300 <i>You are not your job.</i>
5071240 5074610 You're not how much money<br />you have in the bank.
5076310 5078410 You're not the car you drive.
5078920 5081780 You're not the contents of your wallet.
5081850 5084190 You're not your fucking khakis.
5087030 5090690 You are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5099540 5101730 I'll be out of your way in a sec.
5102540 5104630 You don't have to go.
5106150 5108240 Whatever.
5109350 5112440 No, I mean... It's OK.
5121960 5124090 Are you still going to groups?
5124770 5126860 Yeah.
5128330 5130430 Chloe's dead.
5130900 5132900 Wow, Chloe.
5132970 5134910 When did that happen?
5135480 5137340 Do you care?
5137440 5140780 I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.
5141080 5143140 Yeah, well...
5143250 5145580 It was the smart move on her part.
5146960 5148980 Listen...
5150290 5152660 What are you getting out of all this?
5153360 5155450 What?
5155560 5157900 I mean, all this. Why do you keep...
5158670 5160730 Is this making you happy?
5162340 5164400 Yeah, well, sometimes.
5166140 5168270 I don't know. I don't understand.
5168340 5171910 Why does a weaker person<br />need to latch on to a strong person?
5171980 5174110 What is... What is that?
5174180 5176340 What do you get out of it?
5177820 5179910 No... That's not the same thing at all.
5179990 5182120 It's totally different with us.
5182190 5184280 Us?
5184360 5186290 What do you mean by us?
5186360 5190230 - I'm sorry. Do you hear this?<br />- Hear what?
5190330 5192360 - All that noise. Hold on.<br />- No, wait!
5192440 5195160 Don't change the subject!<br />I want to talk about this.
5195240 5198000 - You're not talking about me, are you?<br />- No.
5198140 5201580 - What?<br />- Playing doctor. What was going on there?
5201640 5204910 - What are you talking about?<br />- Nothing. Nothing.
5204980 5207040 - I don't think so.<br />- What do you want?
5207180 5209580 - Look at me.<br />- No. What?
5210350 5213190 - What is that?!<br />- It's nothing. Don't worry.
5213260 5215660 My God. Who did this?
5215760 5217820 - A person.<br />- Guy or girl?
5217930 5220730 - What do you care?<br />- What do you care if I ask?
5220800 5223390 - Leave me alone.<br />- You're afraid to say.
5223470 5225460 - I am not. Let me go.<br />- No! Talk to me.
5225570 5226730 Let go of me!
5226810 5229530 - This conversation<br />- This conversation
5229610 5232080 - is over.<br />- is over.
5232940 5236040 I just can't win with you, can I?
5245390 5247860 Hey, this is getting a little old!
5248460 5250790 What is... What is all this?
5250860 5252960 What do you think?
5253900 5256030 Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
5256100 5257970 Hey!
5264810 5266640 Too young.
5266710 5268370 Sorry.
5268450 5270510 What's all that?
5270620 5273590 If the applicant is young,<br />tell him he's too young.
5273650 5276280 - Old, too old. Fat, too fat.<br />- Applicant?
5276390 5279720 If the applicant waits three days<br />without food or shelter,
5279830 5281890 he may enter and begin training.
5281990 5283830 Training for what?
5289440 5291500 You think this is a game?
5291610 5294270 You're too young to train here, end of story.
5294340 5297070 Quit wasting our time.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
5301020 5303070 Bad news, friend.
5303350 5305440 It's not gonna happen.
5305520 5307820 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
5307890 5309820 It's not the end of the world.
5309890 5312090 Just... go away.
5312960 5315020 Go.
5315100 5318760 You're trespassing<br />and I will have to call the police.
5321870 5323930 Don't you look at me!
5324040 5327300 You're never getting in this fucking house!
5327380 5330740 Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!<br />Get off my porch!
5330850 5334370 <i>Sooner or later,<br />we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>
5334480 5337320 I'm gonna go inside<br />and I'm gonna get a shovel.
5344860 5347060 - Got two black shirts?<br />- Yes, sir.
5347130 5349390 - Two pair of black pants?<br />- Yes, sir.
5349500 5352470 - One pair black boots? Black socks?<br />- Yes, sir.
5352540 5354600 - One blackjacket.<br />- Yes, sir.
5354700 5357700 - $300 personal burial money?<br />- Yes, sir.
5359880 5361940 All right.
5371760 5373820 You're too old, fat man.
5373930 5377090 Your tits are too big.<br />Get the fuck off my porch.
5384900 5386960 Bob! Bob!
5402960 5405620 Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
5406390 5407860 Space monkey.
5407960 5411450 Ready to sacrifice himself<br />for the greater good.
5418070 5420770 You are too fucking old, fatty!
5420840 5424040 And you... You're too fucking
5424140 5425770 blond!
5425850 5428180 Get out of here, the both of you!
5428250 5430380 <i>And so it went.</i>
5430550 5432640 Listen up, maggots.
5432750 5434810 You are not special.
5435160 5438450 You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
5438560 5442890 You are the same decaying organic matter<br />as everything else.
5443000 5445090 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>
5445370 5449000 <i>We are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.</i>
5449070 5452700 <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>
5453770 5457010 <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>
5457080 5459170 <i>To what purpose?</i>
5459250 5461680 <i>For what greater good?</i>
5465020 5467080 <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>
5472430 5475090 When he was like,<br />"You are not yourjob",
5475200 5477260 I was like, "Yeah!"
5479140 5481230 Hey, what's all this?
5481340 5483430 Hey!
5484910 5486600 OK!
5486680 5489040 - What's going on?<br />- We're celebrating.
5489110 5491640 - What are we celebrating?<br />- Go on.
5495650 5497810 - Hey.<br />- Let me get that for you.
5502430 5505290 <i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>
5507660 5509890 Ssh!
5509970 5513770 <i>Investigators are here.<br />The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>
5513870 5516840 <i>Could you tell us<br />what you think has happened here?</i>
5516910 5521140 <i>We believe this is one of many<br />recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>
5521250 5524370 <i>somehow related<br />to underground boxing clubs.</i>
5524480 5528680 <i>We will be coordinating<br />a rigorous investigation.</i>
5529590 5533960 <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs<br />who just arrived on the scene</i>
5534060 5538290 <i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...<br />- She's hot.</i>
5538400 5540190 <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>
5540300 5542700 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
5543670 5546160 - Holy shit!<br />- Yeah!
5553510 5555540 What the fuck did you guys do?
5555610 5559710 <i>Arson investigators<br />are on the premises...</i>
5563490 5568020 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions, sir.
5574230 5576760 The victory in the war against crime
5576840 5578930 will not come overnight.
5579010 5583570 It will take dedication and commitment<br />and, most of all, cooperation.
5583640 5588580 Streets are safer now.<br />There is hope in the inner city. However...
5588650 5590640 I gotta take a piss.
5590750 5593520 These are the first steps in a long journey.
5593590 5596180 That is why we have created Project Hope.
5596260 5598350 Bob.
5601460 5604230 Project Hope will be ajoint effort
5604330 5607060 between the police and community leaders.
5607170 5611330 It will be a powerful new weapon<br />in the war against crime.
5656790 5660920 - Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.<br />- His balls are ice cold.
5662930 5666260 Hi. You're gonna call off<br />your rigorous investigation.
5666330 5669700 You will publicly state<br />there is no underground group or
5669800 5672100 these guys are gonna take your balls.
5673000 5676800 <i>They'll send one to the New York Times<br />and one to the LA Times.</i>
5676880 5678640 Look.
5678710 5681800 The people you are after<br />are the people you depend on.
5681880 5685440 We cook your meals. We haul your trash.<br />We connect your calls.
5685550 5689280 We drive your ambulances.<br />We guard you while you sleep.
5693730 5696520 Do not fuck with us.
5703940 5706060 Ball check!
5720390 5722480 Bob, you're this way.
5723590 5725920 Let's go.
5725990 5729190 <i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>
5730300 5732360 Hey!
5746880 5748140 Yeah!
5780920 5783710 <i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>
5783790 5787650 <i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>
5789790 5792560 <i>I wanted to open the dump valves<br />on oil tankers</i>
5792660 5795530 <i>and smother those French beaches<br />I'd never see.</i>
5798800 5801270 <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>
5818660 5820780 Where did you go, psycho boy?
5822490 5825430 I felt like destroying something beautiful.
5828970 5831030 Get him to a fucking hospital.
5831100 5833190 Yeah.
5843980 5847040 Don't worry, Mr Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.
5848520 5850650 After you, Mr Durden.
5851590 5853680 After you.
5871440 5874040 - Something on your mind, dear?<br />- No.
5874110 5877340 Yeah, why wasn't I told<br />about Project Mayhem?
5877450 5880440 First rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions.
5880520 5882920 Why didn't you include me in the beginning?
5883020 5888220 Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left<br />the basements and it's Project Mayhem.
5888300 5892700 We started Fight Club together. Remember?<br />It's as much mine as it is yours.
5892770 5897030 - Is this about you and me?<br />- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
5897100 5900540 This does not belong to us.<br />We are not special.
5900640 5903080 Fuck that. You should have told me.
5903910 5905900 Hey, Tyler!
5907750 5910240 - Goddamn it, Tyler!<br />- What do you want?!
5910320 5912790 A statement of purpose?<br />Should I e-mail you?
5912890 5915520 - Oh...<br />- You decide your level of involvement!
5915590 5918290 I will! I wanna know certain things first!
5918360 5920990 - The first rule of Project Mayhem...<br />- Shut up!
5922760 5926500 - I wanna know what you're thinking.<br />- Fuck what you know!
5926570 5930060 Forget about what you think you know<br />about life, friendship,
5930140 5932200 and especially about you and me.
5933380 5935540 What is that supposed to mean?
5938950 5941110 What are you doing?
5942020 5944750 What do you wish you'd done<br />before you died?
5944820 5947690 - Paint a self-portrait.<br />- Build a house.
5947790 5950160 - And you?<br />- I don't know. Nothing.
5950230 5952630 - Get in the right lane.<br />- You have to know!
5952760 5955790 If you died now,<br />how would you feel about your life?
5955900 5959530 I don't know! Nothing good.<br />Is that what you want to hear?
5959600 5961940 - Come on!<br />- Not good enough.
5962010 5964440 Stop fucking around! Tyler!
5965710 5967970 Jesus Christ!
5968710 5970810 Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
5970920 5972970 Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
5973050 5975710 I am sick of all your shit!
5975820 5977720 OK, man.
5979520 5982050 - Quit screwing around. Steer!<br />- Look at you!
5982160 5984920 - Steer!<br />- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!
5985000 5990130 - Why? Why? What are you talking about?<br />- Why do you think I blew up your condo?
5990740 5992260 What?
5992370 5996270 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.<br />It's not a goddamned seminar.
5996370 6000070 Stop trying to control everything<br />and just let go!
6001810 6003640 Let go!
6003750 6005840 All right. Fine.
6006690 6008620 Fine.
6067020 6069480 <i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>
6069550 6073010 <i>This must have been<br />what all those people felt like</i>
6073090 6076280 <i>before I filed them<br />as statistics in my reports.</i>
6076360 6078450 Goddamn!
6081960 6085130 We've just had a near-life experience!
6088970 6090960 In the world I see,
6091070 6094940 you're stalking elk<br />through the Grand Canyon forests
6095040 6098040 around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
6100050 6104380 You'll wear leather clothes<br />that will last you the rest of your life.
6104490 6109050 You'll climb the thick kudzu vines<br />that wrap the Sears Tower.
6109130 6113690 And when you look down,<br />you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
6113760 6117320 laying strips of venison<br />in the empty car-pool lane
6117400 6119700 of some abandoned superhighway.
6133150 6135380 Feel better, champ.
6152740 6154540 <i>And then...</i>
6154610 6156160 Tyler?
6156240 6158330 <i>..Tyler was gone.</i>
6165720 6167740 <i>Was I asleep?</i>
6168820 6170850 <i>Had I slept?</i>
6170990 6174020 You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...
6174130 6176560 <i>The house had become a living thing.</i>
6176630 6181260 <i>Wet inside from so many people<br />sweating and breathing.</i>
6181770 6184360 <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>
6187240 6189330 <i>Planet Tyler.</i>
6189410 6191470 <i>I had to hug the walls.</i>
6191580 6194670 <i>Trapped inside<br />this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>
6194780 6198580 You shouldn't be smoking in here!<br />You know how much ether is here!
6198650 6201180 <i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>
6203430 6205480 Hang on a second.
6224410 6227110 It's under control, sir.
6229580 6231420 Where's Tyler?
6231490 6234480 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not...
6234590 6236520 Right... OK.
6238930 6241060 <i>I'm all alone.</i>
6241230 6244860 <i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>
6245000 6247230 <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>
6251440 6255240 <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem<br />only Tyler knows.</i>
6256150 6259340 <i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>
6262150 6264850 Get the fuck away from me!<br />Get the fuck away!
6265260 6267310 Who are all these people?
6272560 6274860 The Paper Street Soap Company.
6276430 6278490 Can I come in?
6281640 6283700 He's not here.
6283770 6286040 What?
6287080 6290640 Tyler isn't here.
6290720 6292770 Tyler went away.
6293250 6295310 Tyler's gone.
6312340 6314070 Get some help!
6325220 6330120 Two gunshot wounds coming through!<br />Make some fucking room!
6330190 6332590 What happened? What happened?
6332690 6335560 We were on assignment. We were supposed<br />to kill two birds with one stone.
6336830 6338920 Destroy a piece of corporate art...
6339000 6341520 Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
6342240 6345400 ..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
6351810 6354180 We had it all worked out, sir.
6362360 6365620 - It went smooth until...<br />- Police! Freeze!
6365730 6368460 - What?<br />- They shot Bob.
6369960 6372400 - They shot him in the head.<br />- Fucking pigs!
6377770 6379800 Oh, God!
6379870 6383170 - Those motherfuckers!<br />- You morons.
6383250 6387380 You're running around in ski masks<br />trying to blow things up?
6387450 6390150 What did you think was gonna happen?!
6391890 6396260 OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.<br />We gotta get rid of this body!
6396360 6399230 - Bury him.<br />- What?
6399300 6401560 Take him to the garden and bury him.
6401630 6404500 - Come on, people, let's go!<br />- Get the fuck off!
6404600 6407830 Get away from him!<br />What are you talking about?
6407900 6410500 This isn't fucking evidence.<br />This is a person.
6410610 6413800 He's my friend<br />and you're not burying him in the garden!
6413880 6416870 He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
6416980 6419010 - This is Bob.<br />- Sir, in...
6419080 6421210 In Project Mayhem, we have no names.
6421290 6423280 Now, you listen to me.
6423390 6427880 This is a man and he has a name,<br />and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
6427990 6429890 - Robert Paulsen.<br />- He's a man
6429990 6432830 and he's dead now because of us.<br />Do you understand that?
6433500 6435800 I understand.
6438040 6441400 In death, a member of Project Mayhem
6441470 6443530 has a name.
6443680 6446610 <i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>
6447050 6449140 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6449910 6452610 His name... is Robert Paulsen.
6452680 6456520 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6456620 6459680 Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
6459760 6462350 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6462460 6465520 Shut up! This is all over with!
6468770 6471290 Get the fuck out of here.
6500000 6504460 - Tyler?<br />- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
6504540 6506100 I need to see you...
6510610 6514670 <i>I went to all the cities<br />on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>
6514750 6519520 <i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look<br />at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>
6519590 6524150 <i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden.<br />It's very important that I talk to him.</i>
6524290 6525920 I wish I could help you,
6525990 6528330 sir.
6533600 6535700 <i>Every city I went to,</i>
6536740 6539140 <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>
6539740 6542010 <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>
6542110 6543770 Hey! Hey!
6544850 6546440 Taxi!
6546550 6548610 Look at my face. I'm a member.
6548720 6551240 Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
6551350 6555020 I'm not exposed to bespeak<br />any such information to you
6555120 6559820 nor would I, even if I had<br />said information at this juncture,... be able.
6560530 6564190 - You're a moron.<br />- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
6565570 6570600 <i>Tyler had been busy...<br />setting up franchises all over the country.</i>
6573380 6577810 <i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>
6577880 6580150 <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>
6581550 6584610 - We've just heard the stories.<br />- What kind of stories?
6584690 6588950 - Nobody knows what he looks like.<br />- He has plastic surgery every three years.
6589030 6592050 That's the stupidest thing<br />I've ever heard.
6592160 6596220 - Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?<br />- Is Mr Durden building an army?
6596370 6599360 <i>I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.</i>
6600170 6602230 <i>Everywhere I went,</i>
6602370 6604310 <i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>
6604410 6607310 <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>
6608410 6610470 <i>The smell of dried blood,</i>
6610580 6614070 <i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>
6614920 6618120 <i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>
6618220 6621780 <i>The feel of a floor still warm<br />from a fight the night before.</i>
6622660 6625600 <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>
6628500 6631630 His name is Robert Paulsen...
6636240 6638340 Welcome back, sir.
6639310 6641410 How have you been?
6641480 6643640 Do you know me?
6643720 6646120 Is this a test, sir?
6646220 6648080 No. This is not a test.
6648150 6650420 You were in here last Thursday.
6650960 6653260 Thursday?
6653360 6657320 You were standing where you are now,<br />asking how good security is.
6657960 6660060 It's tight as a drum, sir.
6662740 6664900 Who do you think I am?
6664970 6667530 Are you sure this isn't a test?
6667640 6669540 No, this is not a test.
6669640 6671700 You're Mr Durden.
6673050 6675710 You're the one who gave me this.
6675780 6679980 <i>Please return your seat backs<br />to their full upright and locked position.</i>
6691470 6693530 <i>- Yeah?<br />- Marla, it's me.</i>
6693600 6695570 <i>- Have we ever done it?<br />- Done what?</i>
6695670 6697000 Had sex?
6697110 6699270 What kind of stupid question is that?
6699370 6701740 Stupid because it's yes<br />or because it's no?
6701810 6704410 <i>- Is this a trick?<br />- No. I need to know...</i>
6704510 6708380 You wanna know if I think<br />we were just having sex or making love?
6708480 6711890 <i>- We did make love?<br />- Is that what you're calling it?</i>
6711960 6714790 Just answer the question!<br />Did we do it or not?!
6714890 6717790 You fuck me, then snub me.<br />You love me, you hate me.
6717900 6720760 You're sensitive,<br />then you turn into an asshole.
6720830 6723530 Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
6723600 6725690 <i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>
6725770 6727240 What did you just say?
6727340 6729700 - What is wrong with you?<br />- Say my name!
6729770 6733440 Tyler Durden!<br />You fucking freak! What's going on?
6733540 6735600 - I'm coming over!<br />- I'm not there!
6735710 6738510 You broke your promise.
6738580 6740550 Jesus, Tyler.
6740620 6744050 - You fucking talked to her about me.<br />- What the fuck is going on?
6744150 6747610 I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.
6747730 6750020 Why do people think that I'm you?
6750600 6752650 Answer me!
6755030 6756860 Sit.
6759670 6762370 Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
6762480 6764640 I think you know.
6764780 6767340 - No, I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6767450 6770180 Why would anyone<br />possibly confuse you with me?
6770250 6773050 I... I don't know.
6777820 6780690 - You got it.<br />- No.
6780790 6782890 - Do not fuck with us!<br />- Say it.
6784260 6786290 Because...
6787670 6788830 Say it!
6790500 6792560 Because we're the same person.
6792640 6794770 That's right.
6794840 6797000 <i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.</i>
6797080 6800810 - I don't understand this.<br />- You wanted a way to change your life.
6800880 6802970 You could not do this on your own.
6803050 6805110 All the ways you wish you could be,
6805220 6807080 that's me.
6807190 6810320 I look like you wanna look,<br />I fuck like you wanna fuck.
6810420 6812790 I am smart, capable and, most importantly,
6812860 6815620 I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
6815700 6816690 Oh, no.
6816800 6819700 - Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.<br />- What?
6819800 6822100 This isn't possible. This is crazy.
6822200 6824230 People do it every day.
6824310 6827870 They talk to themselves.<br />They see themselves as they'd like to be.
6827940 6831210 They don't have the courage you have<br />to just run with it.
6835020 6838350 You still wrestle with it,<br />so sometimes you're still you.
6838490 6843150 - We should do this again sometime.<br />- At times, you imagine you're watching me.
6843260 6845750 If this is your first time, you have to fight.
6845860 6850230 Little by little,<br />you're just letting yourself become
6851070 6852970 Tyler Durden.
6853070 6855870 You are not yourjob<br />or how much money you have!
6855940 6858340 - No. You have a house.<br />- Rented in your name.
6858440 6862070 - You have jobs, a life.<br />- You work nights because you can't sleep.
6862140 6863940 Or you stay up and make soap.
6864050 6868980 - You're fucking Marla, Tyler.<br />- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.
6870720 6872750 Oh, my God.
6873760 6875850 Now you see our dilemma.
6875930 6878190 She knows too much.
6878290 6883390 I think we're gonna have to talk about<br />how this might compromise our goals.
6883530 6885660 What... What are you saying?
6886600 6890870 This is bullshit. This is bullshit,<br />I'm not listening to this!
6890940 6893600 - You are insane!<br />- No. You're insane.
6893710 6896410 We simply do not have time for this crap.
6897920 6900110 <i>It's called a changeover.</i>
6900180 6902280 <i>The movie goes on</i>
6902350 6905480 <i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>
6918440 6922130 - Sir! Are you checking out?<br />- Yeah. Bill me.
6922210 6924640 Can you initial this list of phone calls?
6929050 6933110 - When were these made?<br />- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.
6938960 6943050 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night?<br />Have I been sleeping later?</i>
6943160 6948030 <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>
6950540 6952970 Is anybody here?
6955640 6957740 <i>Déjà vu all over again.</i>
6959380 6961870 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
6964220 6966280 Oh, my God.
6970190 6972560 <i>- 1888.<br />- Who am I calling?</i>
6972990 6976660 <i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?</i>
6977830 6979420 <i>Hello?</i>
6979500 6981630 1888 Franklin Street?
6981700 6983800 <i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>
6986240 6988840 <i>- Hello?<br />- Yeah, yeah.</i>
6988910 6991440 I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
6991510 6993640 <i>- Speaking.<br />- OK, listen to me.</i>
6993720 6996880 Something terrible<br />is about to happen to your building.
6996990 6999050 <i>It's under control, sir.</i>
6999490 7003050 <i>- Excuse me?<br />- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>
7007300 7008660 <i>2160.</i>
7016270 7018800 Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
7020480 7023280 Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7023350 7027510 Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!<br />They almost broke my arm!
7027650 7030350 They were burning their fingertips with lye.
7030450 7034410 This needs a tremendous act of faith<br />on your part, but hear me out.
7034490 7038450 - Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />- A little more faith than that.
7041700 7044260 I don't wanna hear<br />anything you have to say.
7044340 7046460 You have every right to be...
7047070 7048940 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7049040 7051980 Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.
7052080 7054100 Why is it free of charge?
7054180 7056240 - Don't ask.<br />- Whatever.
7056320 7061840 I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken<br />and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.
7061920 7063980 Clean food, please.
7064090 7067120 In that case,<br />may I advise against the clam chowder.
7067190 7069290 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7070760 7072990 You got about 30 seconds.
7075700 7078190 I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
7078300 7081740 - I know it seems there's two sides to me...<br />- Two sides?
7081810 7086870 - You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.<br />- I know. But I realized something important.
7086950 7091010 - What?<br />- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear
7091120 7093480 to me for reasons I won't go into.
7093550 7096150 - I know I haven't treated you well.<br />- Whatever.
7096220 7098950 No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
7099030 7101320 Fifteen seconds,<br />don't open your mouth.
7101400 7103490 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
7103560 7107900 What I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7107970 7110100 You do?
7110170 7112040 I really do.
7112140 7116440 I care about you and I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7116540 7119310 Marla, your life is in danger.
7119380 7121310 What?
7121380 7125110 You need to leave town for a while.<br />Get out of any major city.
7125190 7127980 - Just go camping...<br />- You're an insane person.
7128060 7131510 - No. I've involved you in something terrible.<br />- No. Shut up!
7131590 7134150 - You're not safe.<br />- Shut up!
7135960 7140400 - Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />- I know you did.
7140470 7143530 There are things about you I like.<br />You're smart, funny.
7143610 7145570 You're spectacular in bed.
7145640 7147070 But
7147180 7149230 you're intolerable.
7149340 7151840 You have very serious emotional problems.
7151950 7155880 Deep-seated problems<br />for which you should seek professional help.
7155990 7159940 - I know, and I'm sorry.<br />- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.
7161090 7163180 I can't do this any more.
7163260 7165350 I can't.
7165430 7167490 And I won't.
7167600 7169620 I'm gone.
7169700 7172390 You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7175240 7177900 - Marla, you don't understand!<br />- Leave me alone!
7178010 7180500 - Marla, I am trying to protect you!<br />- Let go!
7180610 7183600 - I don't ever wanna see you again!<br />- That's fine...
7183680 7185810 Here, wait right here!
7189690 7192250 Hold it right there! Shut up!
7192320 7194450 Take this money and get on this bus.
7194520 7196690 I promise I won't bother you again.
7196830 7198260 Shut up!
7198330 7201530 Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.
7202700 7204830 Why are you doing this?
7204900 7209000 They think you're a threat.<br />I can't explain it now, just trust me!
7209070 7213440 - If I know where you are, you won't be safe.<br />- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.
7213510 7217920 - Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.<br />- Tyler.
7219450 7222280 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7237300 7239970 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7240070 7242840 I am the leader of a terrorist organization
7242910 7247870 responsible for numerous acts<br />of vandalism and assault all over this city.
7247950 7251850 In the metropolitan area,<br />we had probably 200 members.
7251920 7255720 Chapters have sprung up<br />in five or six other major cities already.
7255890 7258920 This is a tightly-regimented organization
7258990 7264590 with many cells capable of operating<br />independent of central leadership.
7264700 7268570 Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.
7268670 7270570 That's our headquarters.
7270670 7273270 In the back, buried in the garden,
7273340 7276370 you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7276480 7279780 In the basement,<br />you're gonna find some bathtubs
7279910 7285220 that have been used very recently<br />to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7285320 7287350 I believe the plan is to blow up
7287420 7290520 the headquarters<br />of these credit card companies
7290590 7292690 and the TRW building.
7293630 7297000 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit card companies?
7297100 7300690 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7301540 7303600 You'll create total chaos.
7305210 7308440 Keep him talking. I need to make a phone<br />call.
7319020 7321250 I really admire what you're doing.
7321730 7323780 What?
7323930 7325950 You're a brave man to order this.
7326030 7327790 You're a genius, sir.
7327930 7332630 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7332740 7335070 we gotta get his balls.
7336470 7339640 - Don't fight.<br />- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.
7339740 7342770 - It will set an example.<br />- You're making a big mistake!
7342850 7345680 - You said you'd say that.<br />- I'm not Tyler Durden!
7345780 7349650 - You told us you'd say that too.<br />- All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7349750 7352450 Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.
7352560 7356690 - We're aborting this mission now.<br />- You said you would definitely say that.
7362830 7366400 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7367240 7369300 Is somebody timing this?
7369470 7372440 Keep your mouth shut.
7372510 7374600 Shit!
7377250 7380050 Some of this information checks out.
7380120 7383420 - Let's go to that house on Paper Street.<br />- Be right there.
7384120 7385890 Hey, wait!
7386590 7389120 - I got him.<br />- Sir, we have to do this.
7389230 7391700 - Stop fighting!<br />- Where's the rubber band?
7391800 7394290 Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!
7397840 7401270 Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
7402510 7404530 Get down on the floor!
7409320 7412220 The first person<br />that comes out of this door
7412290 7414250 gets a lead salad! Understand?
7438580 7441170 Get away! Stay away!
7454130 7456190 <i>I ran.</i>
7456730 7460900 <i>I ran until my muscles burned<br />and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>
7463540 7465600 <i>Then I ran some more.</i>
7506320 7508620 What the fuck are you doing?
7508720 7511660 Running around in your underpants!<br />You look crazy!
7511760 7514850 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7514960 7519860 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
7567850 7570510 - Oh, Christ.<br />- Now what are you doing?
7570620 7573990 - I'm stopping this.<br />- Why?
7574060 7577460 - The greatest thing you've ever done.<br />- I can't let this happen.
7577530 7580790 There are 10 other bombs<br />in 10 other buildings.
7580860 7583230 Since when is Project Mayhem<br />about murder?
7583300 7585290 The buildings are empty.
7585400 7588230 We're not killing anyone.<br />We're setting 'em free!
7588300 7591070 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7591210 7594540 You wanna make an omelette,<br />you gotta break some eggs.
7594640 7598240 No. I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7604290 7608660 I wouldn't do that.<br />Not unless you knew which wires were what.
7608720 7610450 If you know, I know.
7616070 7620430 <i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>
7628950 7630040 You think?
7632050 7634140 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7634980 7637980 Pull any one but the green one.
7642730 7645350 I asked you not to do that!
7647200 7648760 Fuck!
7649700 7651790 Tyler, get away from the van.
7654000 7657410 Tyler, I'm not kidding!<br />Get away from the van!
7657510 7658870 Goddamn it!
7665220 7666580 OK.
7666690 7670020 You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend
7670120 7672720 near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
7674930 7676690 Cool it, Tyler!
7689910 7691970 Come on!
7692040 7694100 Don't go!
7731690 7732880 What?!
7778370 7779060 Three minutes.
7780000 7782300 This is it.
7782410 7784430 The beginning.
7784510 7786480 Ground zero.
7786540 7788840 <i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>
7788910 7791400 Do you have a speech for the occasion?
7791480 7794510 I'm sorry?
7794620 7796680 I still can't think of anything.
7798720 7800820 Flashback humor.
7805900 7807920 It's getting exciting now.
7809500 7811300 Two and a half.
7811370 7813930 Think of everything we've accomplished.
7814040 7818840 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7818910 7822640 One step closer to economic equilibrium.
7836200 7838590 Why is she here?
7838700 7840600 Tying up loose ends.
7840700 7843760 Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!
7843870 7846960 - I beg you, please don't do this.<br />- I'm not doing this.
7847070 7850530 <i>- We are doing this. This is what we want.<br />- No.</i>
7850610 7855340 - I don't want this.<br />- Right. Except you is meaningless now.
7855410 7859410 - We have to forget about you.<br />- You're a voice in my head.
7859520 7861580 You're a voice in mine!
7861690 7864520 - Why can't I get rid of you?<br />- You need me.
7864590 7866680 No. I don't. I really don't any more.
7866760 7871030 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make me feel better.
7871130 7875090 - Take some responsibility.<br />- I do. I am responsible for all of it
7875200 7876930 and I accept that.
7877000 7881030 So, please, I'm begging you,<br />please call this off.
7883040 7885240 Have I ever let us down?
7886710 7889010 How far have you come because of me?!
7894920 7896980 I will bring us through this.
7897060 7900860 As always, I will carry you<br />kicking and screaming
7900960 7903400 and in the end you will thank me.
7903870 7906390 Tyler. Tyler.
7906470 7910000 I'm grateful to you.<br />For everything that you've done for me.
7910070 7912770 But this is too much. I don't want this.
7912840 7918140 What do you want? Your shitjob back?<br />Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
7918210 7920270 Fuck you! I won't do it.
7921150 7924990 - This can't be happening.<br />- It's already done, so shut up!
7925060 7926680 60 seconds till CRI.
7927220 7929280 No.
7931190 7933990 I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
7934060 7937760 You're not real, that gun...<br />That gun isn't even in your hand.
7939240 7941300 The gun's in my hand.
7946310 7948800 Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
7957690 7960320 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
7960460 7962520 Not my head, Tyler.
7963090 7965120 Our head.
7966670 7968720 Interesting.
7971740 7974400 Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?
7980880 7983870 Hey. It's you and me.
7986620 7988680 Friends?
7989520 7991620 Tyler,
7995030 7997360 I want you to really listen to me.
7997500 7999930 OK.
8000030 8002090 My eyes are open.
8020850 8022880 What's that smell?
8042510 8045500 - Where is everybody?<br />- Oh, no. What's going on?
8046150 8047740 Mr Durden!
8048820 8050680 Oh, my God!
8056030 8059220 Are you... Are you all right, sir?
8059330 8063290 - Oh, yeah, I'm OK.<br />- You look terrible, sir. What happened?
8063370 8067360 - Nothing, it's no problem.<br />- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
8067440 8070200 - You look awful. You need assistance.<br />- I'm fine.
8070340 8073930 Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.
8076210 8078440 Stop it!
8078580 8081710 - Let her go.<br />- Christ Almighty!
8081780 8083580 You!
8083650 8085750 Hi, Marla.
8086220 8091060 - Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.<br />- Are you sure?
8091160 8093220 Yes, I'm sure.
8094330 8098430 You fucker! What kind of sick<br />fucking game are you playing at?!
8098570 8101230 Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!
8101340 8102830 Yeah, I know.
8107610 8109480 What happened?
8109610 8111740 - Don't ask.<br />- You're shot.
8111820 8113880 - Yes, I'm shot.<br />- Oh, my God.
8114820 8117850 - I can't believe he's standing.<br />- One tough motherfucker.
8121660 8123490 Who did this?
8123630 8126100 I did, actually.
8126200 8128260 Find some gauze.
8129640 8131660 You shot yourself?
8131770 8134400 Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.
8134470 8136770 I'm really OK.
8136840 8140800 Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
8153630 8157490 You met me at a very strange time in my life.
