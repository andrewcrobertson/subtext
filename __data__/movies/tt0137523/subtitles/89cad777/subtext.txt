5297 6503 David Fincher.
6590 12927 So, originally we tried to get,<br />I think, ILM to do the new Fox logo.
13847 16635 It was being done<br />while we were doing <i>Alien</i> 3,
16725 19217 and we were trying to get the digital files
19436 25933 so that we could put some<br />subliminal Tylerisms into the Fox logo.
26068 29106 Actually, I went to Arnon<br />after the thing and said:
29196 32814 "Please let me redo the Regency logo."
43627 47621 So the opening title sequence<br />was supposed to be
47756 52626 starting inside the fear centre<br />of Edward Norton's brain,
52761 56220 and the electricity that's<br />running through it
56306 61676 is like photoelectrical stimuli<br />that's running through his brain.
61770 67686 These are supposed to be fear-based<br />impulses, and we're pulling through.
67776 73988 We're changing scales the whole time, so<br />we're just starting at, like, the size of a...
74241 77359 you know, a dendrite,<br />or whatever these things are.
77452 81912 We're pulling back through<br />the frontal lobes, and we're gonna exit.
81999 85333 We go into this,<br />there's this whole black section in there
85419 88502 where it's just like<br />little particles going by,
88589 93584 we've left the brain, and we're now<br />moving to the skull casing.
93677 98217 This is inside the skull<br />where Arnon's name appears.
98307 103802 He's actually inside the...<br />the skull of... inside bone,
103895 107013 which, apparently, there's fluid in.<br />I didn't know that.
107107 111192 And we pull out through this clogged pore<br />in Edward's face.
111278 115738 I remember showing him... The first time<br />we showed him the rough test of this,
115824 118361 he was, like, "My face is not that dirty."
118452 124698 And I said, you know, "This is all based on<br />actual photographs of your skin."
128795 131457 But I wanted to do this...
131548 136418 If there's ever a chance<br />for a <i>Fight Club</i> ride at Universal Studios,
136511 141972 this is gonna be it,<br />the brain ride, flying down Edward's nose,
142059 147805 and seeing all the little crusty scabs<br />at the end of his nostrils.
161203 165743 The shot where the camera tilts down<br />and falls away from the skyscraper,
165832 170167 and then goes through the street,<br />and goes into the subterranean parking,
170253 172870 then across the street<br />into the other parking,
172964 176923 was kind of something<br />that we hit on late in the film.
177052 183515 We were trying to come up with ideas<br />for ways to show his thought process,
183600 187309 his kind of manic dissociative state.
188855 191096 So we had this idea we were gonna do...
191233 195693 We knew we were gonna do<br />the whole kind of tour through his kitchen
195779 200649 and show how the whole kitchen had filled<br />up with gas, and how his apartment...
200742 204451 some kind of logical explanation<br />for how his apartment exploded.
204579 209289 And when we started seeing the tests for<br />it, we thought, "We gotta do more of this."
209376 212164 There has to be<br />a couple of other times in the movie
212295 218382 where we see kind of how quickly<br />he thinks, his thought process.
218468 223258 When we saw the photogrammetry<br />tests of the kitchen stuff,
223390 224596 we started thinking, "Wow."
224683 228927 We could really open the movie<br />on the 31st floor of this building,
229020 231227 then go out the window<br />and drop all the way down,
231314 234523 and see the bombs, see the jerry cans,
235026 238360 go through the side of the van<br />and across the street into another.
238447 245447 So that became sort of a little... not<br />thematic, but it was a little bookended...
245579 251951 kind of a precursor<br />to how crazy his thought process is.
260510 265425 There's another example of it<br />the galactic tour of garbage.
281031 285025 This is Zach Grenier.<br />He's a really terrific actor.
286495 287656 I don't think he appreciated us saying:
287746 291831 "Oh, you're perfect for<br />the smarmy boss's role."
292375 296585 I don't know if anybody likes being perfect<br />for the smarmy boss's role.
296671 302041 But I always liked the idea of the boss<br />being this guy who's not...
302177 306842 He's trying to kind of be empathetic to<br />this, you know, guy who works for him.
306932 308593 But he doesn't want to<br />get involved enough
308683 311300 to truly find out how deranged he is.
311394 314557 So he's caught between<br />a rock and a hard place.
314648 316935 It's only later in the movie that he realizes
317025 321565 that this guy's<br />a disgruntled postal worker in the making.
321655 328527 The FÃ¼rni catalogue idea was, again,<br />some kind of visual representation
328620 335620 of this, you know, the idea that we're<br />a by-product of the armor that we select
335961 338953 to let people know who we are,
339089 343208 and that that's not just clothes<br />and cars and, you know, hairstyles,
343301 346669 but it's also the furniture that you pick,
346763 353100 whether or not it's, you know, sort of<br />Southwestern, or Pottery Barn, or Ikea.
353186 356269 In this case, it's Ikea.
367075 368986 Funny thing when we...
369119 374614 I got asked to do some liner notes<br />for the record that the Dust Brothers did.
374708 378201 And I got called by Fox Legal<br />and they said...
378295 381629 'Cause I'd written this thing<br />in the liner notes that said
382132 388845 the Dust Brothers are talented, and witty<br />and brilliant and all these things,
388930 394516 and the little quote ended saying, "They<br />don't have a stick of Ikea between them."
394603 399723 And we got a call from Fox Legal<br />saying we can't use these liner notes
399816 402274 'cause it's corporate disparagement.
402360 407070 And I remember asking<br />if they'd seen the movie.
407157 411151 "Have you seen the movie? Do you<br />know what corporate disparagement is?"
411244 414453 But they were very nervous<br />about Ikea being upset.
414539 417327 Thus far,<br />we haven't heard anything from them.
417417 421331 Actually, I got a call -<br />"Can you rewrite this thing?"
421463 423420 "Does it have to say...
423506 426624 "Can it just say they don't have<br />a stick of prefabricated furniture?"
426718 430632 I said, "It's a joke. It's in the movie.<br />You have to understand that."
430722 435341 And they said, "Well, we've called them,<br />and John King swears to us
435435 438018 "that they do have a lot of Ikea furniture."
438146 443016 And I just said, "You're not understanding<br />what we're talking about here."
443151 446689 So they ended up killing the liner notes.
466925 469792 Meat Loaf. I was wondering who...
469886 473379 Bob was always<br />a favorite character of mine in the book
473473 479560 and I couldn't figure out<br />who should play this guy, like, who...
479646 482638 <i>And</i> I <i>was</i> watching<br /><i>VH1 Behind the Scenes,</i>
482732 484643 and it was a whole thing on Meat Loaf.
484734 489649 And I remember watching this thing going,<br />"This guy is so sweet."
489739 492151 He has this incredible sweetness.
492242 495325 I always remember him,<br />you know, covered in sweat
495412 498655 with long hair<br />kind of matted to his face, you know,
498748 501035 bellowing at the top of his voice.
501126 504744 So I'd always picture,<br />and, obviously, the <i>Rocky Horror</i> images,
504838 508502 this kind of Tasmanian devil<br />on a motorcycle.
508591 513506 But I saw this special and I thought, "Wow,<br />there's something amazing about him."
513596 518215 I remember saying to Edward, "What do<br />you think of Meat Loaf?" And he was, like:
518309 521427 "Dave, I hope you're not<br />gonna populate this whole movie
521521 524013 "with your music-video friends."
524107 529273 And he came in to read,<br />and I think he read for about 20 seconds,
529362 533196 and he did this embrace,<br />and he started doing his high-pitched...
533283 535820 he does this higher voice<br />than he has in real life.
535952 540537 It's a very little voice, it's up here<br />'cause his testicles have been lost.
540623 545242 And I remember Edward<br />just howling with laughter.
545336 547043 Literally, at about 25 seconds,
547130 551294 we'd got through<br />one page and Edward looked at me:
551384 558051 "He's perfect. We gotta get him."<br />And so we offered him the job right there.
558558 563894 And we tried to get these stamps made up<br />for what a face would look like
563980 568440 so we could just stamp these shirts<br />so that all the shirts would look the same.
568526 574522 They never looked right. So we ended up<br />having to paint them on the day.
588004 590462 When I first read the book...
590548 593586 Actually, when we first started<br />writing the screenplay,
593676 596043 when Jim Uhls<br />was writing the screenplay,
596179 602801 I was very concerned about<br />who was gonna be watching these dailies
602894 608060 because we were gonna be shooting<br />support groups to the terminally ill,
608149 614361 and the humor in the movie, for those of<br />us who think there is humor in the movie,
614447 619157 comes out of the voice-over and how he<br />comments cynically on his surroundings.
619244 621906 He's very... he has<br />a very sardonic sense of humor,
623414 625121 the Edward Norton character.
625208 627575 And I remember thinking,
627669 631287 "We'd better have a really<br />good producer on the lot at Fox
631381 635045 who can walk these executives<br />through these dailies,
635135 639550 because they're gonna see<br />about five weeks of shooting
639639 644884 that is just gonna be a bunch of people<br />with shaved heads, crying."
659993 663657 <i>One of my</i> favorite movies <i>as a kid<br />was The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.</i>
663746 669992 I always loved the little flights of fancy<br />in the movie, his little dream sequences.
670086 674000 I always saw the penguin sequence<br />as being one of those little moments
674090 679711 where you just kind of say,<br />"Yep, things can get this surreal."
679804 681795 "Get ready."
685059 688802 Marla's entrance is<br />one of my favorite moments in the movie.
688897 694688 I just love the way she kind of takes<br />the stage. She was so funny.
695278 698066 She had these boots on that were clogs.
698156 700989 It was like a Clydesdale<br />coming up the stairs.
701117 705281 You could hear this woman coming from,<br />like, three floors below.
705371 708159 We wanted to make that<br />a part of Marla's character.
708249 713039 Everywhere she went, she enters a room,<br />like, five minutes before she gets there.
713129 716042 Clomp, clomp, clomp.
717467 722132 And this is a joke<br />that was often lost on preview audiences.
722222 728969 They didn't really understand<br />the sickle-cell anemia gag.
732190 736229 I love this moment.<br />I love her as this kind of...
738154 744821 you know, the sort of perverse Goth<br />version of a Tony Scott femme
744911 748120 with the sunglasses on inside, and she's<br />sort of sleek,
748206 752165 but just a little teeny bit crusty.
752919 755206 She smokes so well.
756464 760332 There's another example<br />of what we call the "subliminal Brads".
760426 765592 There's four or five shots<br />in the first reel before we meet Brad
765682 768174 where Brad appears for one frame.
768268 774105 And I always loved the idea of... There was<br />a book in the '703 called Subliminal Sex.
774190 779310 And it was supposed to be sort of<br />an expose on the advertising industry
779404 784945 and the use of subliminal imagery, the<br />idea of airbrushing skulls and crossbones
785034 789323 and death imagery into ice for close-ups,
789414 793499 for, you know, Johnnie Walker ads<br />that'll be in <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>
793584 799626 I always loved that idea and I loved,<br />thematically, the way Chuck had this...
799716 803050 Tyler is a character<br />who abuses subliminal imagery
803136 808802 to his own kind of... morbid sensibilities.
809434 811892 But I loved the idea of him...
811978 817473 Edward's kind of trying to make peace with<br />the world, and trying to figure his way,
817567 821151 and there's this character<br />who's about to come into his life
821237 824025 who just keeps appearing<br />for one nanosecond.
824115 828029 He's just there,<br />and he's always sort of impatient, like:
828119 833535 "When are you gonna create me? I can<br />solve a lot of these problems for you."
833624 836537 He's always sort of exasperated.
851726 854184 I never took advertising seriously enough
854270 859765 to worry if there is<br />any moral ambiguity about...
859859 866859 I mean, I think that this film probably more<br />accurately depicts my take on advertising,
868576 871785 and its, you know...
871913 876328 and what it provides for society<br />than any of the advertising I did.
876417 882003 But, you know, you...<br />you work where you can, you know?
882131 884122 I'd rather have started off in movies,
884217 888381 but nobody was that interested<br />in hiring me to make movies early on,
888471 895471 so I did music videos and commercials as a<br />way to just, you know, play with the tools.
908074 911283 We had an idea early on<br />that one of the images for the poster
911369 916159 might be just all these stickers<br />that say, "Hello, my name is"...
916249 922495 these stickers that all these guys wear<br />in the support groups, the name tags.
939188 941350 I love her topknot that she always has.
941441 944354 She always has this<br />little kind of shark's fin
944444 946776 that kind of pokes up above the frame.
946863 952984 It's very difficult to frame Helena<br />because her face is so beautiful and round
953077 955910 and she has this kind of perfect little head.
955997 960116 And then, you know, I think<br />Michael and Frida came up with this idea
960209 963543 for her always having this, like,<br />little spout at the top that's...
963629 968123 She becomes a real cinematic conundrum.
968217 974839 It's very difficult to frame her face because<br />you're always trying to include this thing.
984567 988105 Edward Norton has<br />some of the best bags under his eyes.
988196 992360 I mean, just naturally. Just, as a person,<br />he always has these circles.
992450 997035 He was perfect for this.<br />He's almost like Buster Keaton.
1009967 1015053 I was sent a book... I was sent the book<br />by Josh Donen, who's an agent...
1015139 1017380 who's now one of my agents at CAA,
1017475 1021013 who was a producer,<br />who had a deal here at Fox.
1021103 1024846 He called me and said, "I'm sending you<br />this book, read it tonight."
1024941 1028309 And I was, like,<br />"I can't read a book tonight."
1028402 1032566 I was finishing The <i>Game,</i> and I was<br />working, you know, 12-hour days cutting.
1032657 1037276 And... you know, I wasn't that inclined.
1037370 1040283 I'm not the kind of person<br />who reads a lot, anyway.
1040373 1043206 He said,<br />"No, you can read this book in a night."
1043292 1047707 I said to him, "Give me a reason<br />why I should read this book."
1047797 1051381 He said, "There's a scene in this book<br />where this guy, this anarchist,
1051467 1056962 "who pisses in soup and splices single<br />frames of pornography into family films,
1057056 1061220 "takes a convenience-store worker<br />in the middle of the night."
1061310 1065053 "Brings him out to the parking lot<br />and puts a gun to his head,
1065147 1067479 "and asks him what<br />he wanted to do with his life."
1067567 1070059 "And the guy says<br />he wanted to be a veterinarian,
1070152 1071813 "but the school was too tough."
1071904 1075772 "And the guy cocks the gun<br />and says, 'Give me your wallet.â
1075866 1079200 "And he says, 'I have your wallet.<br />I know where you live."'
1079287 1082496 "'If you're not working to become a vet<br />in six weeks, you're dead.â
1082582 1086997 And I just thought, "Okay,<br />I gotta read this book. Send it over."
1087128 1090621 Next morning, I called and said,<br />"How do we get involved in this?"
1090715 1093798 And he said,<br />"Well, Fox just bought the material,
1093884 1098094 but you can go in and sort of<br />pitch your version of it to Laura Ziskin."
1098180 1105180 And I'd met Laura before, but I didn't<br />understand. I could not fathom the idea
1105521 1109230 that 20th Century Fox<br />would want to make this movie.
1109317 1112685 I went in and said, "I want to take<br />the book, make it into a movie."
1112778 1117614 "I don't want to change it much. I want to<br />try to maintain as much of this voice."
1117700 1124163 I think, ultimately, that the strongest thing<br />the film has going for it is Chuck's voice.
1124248 1129709 He's truly got his own take on things.
1129795 1134005 I went in and I basically said that,<br />and we kind of made this deal.
1134091 1137959 I said, "I'm not interested<br />in getting involved in a big situation
1138054 1142673 "where junior development people<br />read the script and we get these notes."
1142767 1145759 "What I'll happily do<br />is not take any money,
1145853 1148971 "and I'll work with the writer<br />that we can mutually select,
1149065 1152774 "and we will come back<br />whenever we're done"
1153653 1160653 "And we'll bring you a script, and a budget,<br />and a cast, and storyboards for the film."
1161160 1165028 "You'll have an idea of the film<br />that we want to make,
1165122 1166908 "and you can decide if you're in."
1166999 1172915 "I'm really not looking to get involved in<br />some kind of long-term back and forth."
1173047 1178133 And she was great. She said,<br />"Fine. That's sounds great."
1178260 1184506 So we went away, about a year later<br />came back, and gave them the script,
1184600 1186182 gave them the storyboards.
1186268 1191263 It was, like, the size of a bible<br />or a giant unabridged dictionary.
1191357 1193223 Boom, put this whole package down.
1193317 1195729 And I said, "It's Brad Pitt<br />and Edward Norton.
1195820 1198232 "We don't know who the girl is yet."
1198322 1202031 "Call me if this is a movie<br />you want to make."
1202118 1204951 And they called and said,<br />"Yeah. Let's go do it."
1205037 1206653 To their credit, I gotta say,
1206747 1213747 I've never been involved in a movie<br />where things were not second-guessed.
1213963 1217126 When we got into the screening process,<br />for the audience,
1217216 1222006 there were definite issues about length,<br />you know, most of which I had myself.
1222096 1224303 If I could make the movie shorter, I would.
1224390 1229055 But given my intimate knowledge of all<br />the material, I couldn't get it any shorter.
1229145 1233514 I probably could now. If I could take a year<br />off and walk away and go, I could.
1233607 1236190 But at that time,<br />those were the only concerns.
1236277 1240817 I think that Bill and Arnon and Laura really,<br />from the day they first saw it,
1240906 1244820 really said, "No, we like it the way it is."
1244910 1251156 "If you can make it more user-friendly,<br />great, and if you can't, great."
1290915 1295534 The movie was supposed to come out<br />in summer and we pushed back till fall
1295628 1298586 after, I think, our final test screening.
1301175 1305169 And a lot of people speculated that it was<br />because of the Columbine incident.
1305262 1312262 But, in actuality, Bill Mechanic and Arnon<br />Milchan both called me one day and said:
1312978 1316221 "If you had your druthers,<br />would you like to do more work?"
1316315 1320684 And of course, I'd always like to do<br />more work. So I said, "Yeah, I'd love to."
1320778 1325238 And they said, "How much time... within<br />reason, how much time can you use?"
1325324 1329659 And I said, "If I could have another<br />three or four weeks, it would be great."
1329745 1333909 And so they spent the 650, 700,000 dollars
1334041 1340458 to give me that time to make the movie<br />better and take a few more frames out.
1342341 1345584 But nobody balked.
1348472 1351715 It's difficult to make a film<br />if you don't have people saying:
1351809 1354676 "No, no, no.<br />We knew what we were getting into,"
1354770 1358388 'cause there's a lot of room<br />for interpretation.
1358482 1360598 A lot of people come back and say:
1360693 1364186 "We knew it was gonna be<br />about support groups and cancer victims,
1364280 1367523 but we never knew<br />it was gonna be quite like this."
1367616 1370074 "Can you soften the blow?"
1370160 1376702 But I never got any of that. It was actually<br />the best experience I've ever had.
1377960 1379576 Especially with this material.
1379670 1383959 I could not have imagined<br />we would get the support we got.
1411035 1417327 This is funny. This is the scene where we<br />meet Brad for the first time, on the plane.
1417416 1420329 I love this scene.<br />I love the way it was written.
1420419 1422001 This scene doesn't exist in the book.
1422087 1424749 In the book, they meet on a nude beach.
1424840 1428253 And I thought, "Hm."<br />As much as I'd like to shoot that,
1428344 1431427 and I think that that would be<br />a really uncomfortable place
1431513 1434756 for an audience to meet characters,<br />I don't think we can do...
1434850 1439014 It's all about a guy<br />who's flying from here to there,
1439146 1444391 and him being out of this time zone<br />and insomniacal.
1444485 1447568 So we gotta kind of<br />set this meeting scene on an airplane.
1447696 1450779 Jim came up with the scene.<br />I always loved the way it read.
1450866 1453949 I always had this nagging feeling<br />in the back of my head
1454036 1456653 that it wasn't gonna come off.
1456747 1459535 There are certain scenes<br />that you work and polish.
1459625 1465712 You try to get them as tight<br />and as concise and funny or whatever.
1465839 1469252 I remember shooting the master,<br />and the camera kind of eases over
1469385 1473128 and reveals Brad behind Edward<br />as he wakes up.
1473222 1477386 And, you know, it's really the master,<br />the two-shot of them.
1477518 1483355 Take eight into it, it was like...<br />Not even looking at the monitor,
1483440 1487274 just hearing it over the headphones,<br />it was, like, "This is great."
1487361 1494361 Brad was completely that aberrant<br />creature that you meet that's fascinating.
1496245 1501206 And Edward was so perfectly:
1501291 1504204 "I just woke up<br />and I'm not sure what you're saying."
1504294 1507161 There was this great<br />kind of half-step behind.
1507256 1511841 It's one of those moments where you go,<br />"These are the perfect guys for this."
1511927 1515045 "It just worked out."
1537411 1541951 The book takes place<br />in Wilmington, Delaware,
1542041 1547707 because that's, like, a headquarters<br />for a lot of credit card companies.
1548380 1552294 And we wanted to make the film<br />take place in Wilmington, Delaware,
1552384 1556093 but there's some kind of clearance issues.
1556180 1563180 If it's a specific town, then you have to<br />get clearances for specific names, streets,
1563937 1565803 apartment buildings.
1565898 1568560 We decided to,<br />in the interest of clearances,
1568650 1574066 which has really become just the bane of<br />my existence, the whole legal clearances...
1574156 1577774 I think there was actually<br />a situation with Maria Singer
1577868 1580826 where, when they did<br />the name clearance on Marla Singer,
1580913 1585453 they do this, like, global search,<br />or at least, you know, the United States,
1585542 1587874 they did a search for Marla Singer.
1587961 1591670 Had they found five or six Marla Singers<br />or a thousand Marla Singers,
1591757 1597093 it wouldn't have been an issue. Somebody<br />says, "I'm being disparaged in this movie."
1597179 1602265 "In this chain-smoking person addicted<br />to support groups, you're disparaging me."
1602351 1607596 But if there's a thousand, you can always<br />say, "It's not you. Prove that it's you."
1607689 1610772 And so you don't have to<br />get any kind of clearances.
1610859 1616525 But there's only one Marla Singer in<br />the United States, in Illinois somewhere.
1616615 1621325 And as soon as attorneys get involved,<br />the whole thing gets completely fucked up.
1621411 1625154 Somebody told her there was this book,<br />and that we're making a movie
1625249 1627411 based on this character with her name.
1627501 1630664 Then her attorneys are calling,<br />and we had to pay her off.
1630754 1635339 So it becomes this big issue<br />if you set a movie in a specific place.
1635425 1640044 You have to get specific clearances<br />based on... Like, the Pearson Towers.
1640139 1642005 If they say it's Delaware,
1642099 1645888 you have to get permission<br />if there's a Pearson anything in Delaware.
1646019 1650809 So we just said it was,<br />like, any city, anywhere.
1650899 1654563 But our homage to Wilmington, Delaware<br />is that the...
1654653 1660319 I believe the Delaware state motto is,<br />"Delaware, a place to be somebody."
1660409 1661945 So we decided to...
1662077 1666992 The Pearson Towers,<br />their little logo on their brass sign is:
1667082 1669699 "A place to be somebody."
1671837 1674249 We had the Delaware flag<br />in the background.
1674339 1680711 The props department kept bringing the<br />flag and we would put it on the flagpole.
1680804 1683592 The camera never tilts up<br />high enough to see it.
1683682 1688051 But, of course, the Fox representatives<br />were down there on the set,
1688145 1691354 watching the monitors,<br />making sure we didn't see the flag
1691440 1696901 because then we'd have to go back<br />and reclear everybody's names.
1696987 1701982 "There might be a Lou's Tavern<br />in Wilmington, Delaware."
1759341 1764677 This scene, where they first have<br />their real, kind of, thesis scene,
1764763 1767380 was written very late in the game.
1767474 1773265 I think it was Andy Walker, who kind of<br />came in and figured this one out.
1773355 1776017 We could never...
1776108 1782070 we could never figure out how to sort of<br />begin Tyler's rant, as it were,
1782197 1787692 his anti-consumerism... leanings.
1787786 1790699 We could never present them<br />or announce them.
1790789 1795955 And finally, we, the four of us,<br />Brad and Edward and Andy,
1796044 1800129 sat down for a couple of afternoons<br />and just spitballed this scene.
1800215 1803799 He came back with some pages<br />and we threw about half of it out.
1803885 1810885 And then I put two cameras on them<br />and kind of just let them go
1811059 1815144 so that both these angles<br />were being recorded at the same time,
1815230 1818564 and we shot thousands of feet on this,
1818650 1822018 just saying, "Okay, try to kind of<br />get this idea. Now try..."
1822112 1824399 And we just sort of let them go wild.
1824531 1828946 A great thing about using two cameras is<br />every time Brad does these hand gestures,
1829036 1833405 you can see them in the other camera<br />and they're actually in synch,
1833498 1837867 which is always a total nightmare<br />when you're doing it single-camera.
1837961 1841795 But it was one of those scenes<br />where we just... DPs hate this.
1841882 1845250 But we went in and said,<br />"Here are the two cameras."
1845385 1850346 "They're both on 353<br />and bring lots of film."
1850432 1855268 I think we shot, like, 37,<br />38 takes of this scene.
1855395 1860731 Probably shot 40,000 ft that day,
1860817 1863559 which is a lot.
1885675 1888292 This is probably<br />my favorite scene in the movie.
1888387 1894383 I think the first punch<br />that Edward delivers as the narrator,
1894476 1900313 at first, it was always a question like,<br />"Can you bring the audience to this?"
1900399 1903061 "Can it be an innocent enough thing?"
1903151 1907145 I guess there are undercurrents of<br />sadomasochism throughout the movie,
1907239 1914239 but they're supposed to be the initial hook<br />in his cheek for Edward Norton's character.
1916081 1919619 It's supposed to come from this very, like...
1919709 1923919 "I've been thinking about this thing. Maybe<br />I'm wrong... I'm doing you a favor."
1924005 1926497 "If you want to<br />spend the night at my house..."
1926591 1929424 "Just do me this one thing<br />I've been thinking about."
1929511 1933049 "I'm not sure where it's going.<br />I don't know what it's about,
1933181 1936799 but if you could just hit me,<br />I think there's something in this."
1936893 1941057 And I was always very concerned<br />that we'd be able to pull off this kind of...
1941148 1946985 that it could come from this innocent place<br />of, like, you know... "Do it. Just try it."
1948029 1952148 And that it wouldn't feel forced,<br />that it wouldn't feel manufactured.
1952242 1956281 And I think it was take ten<br />we shot of the master,
1956371 1958988 I remember<br />just almost falling out of my chair.
1959082 1962950 It was so funny, the way<br />he hit Brad on the side of his head
1963044 1969666 with that completely limp... It just looked<br />like two five-year-olds on a playground.
1969759 1973468 And just this experiment,<br />this, like, raw experiment in...
1973555 1978345 "Okay, I'm gonna try this."<br />And it just cracked me up.
1978435 1981553 Brad's reaction to being punched<br />in the ear was so...
1981646 1985640 It just seemed like... The camera<br />was still rolling, and this guy was...
1985734 1991980 He was, like, "Where are the stunt guys?<br />Why? Why did this happen? Ouch."
1994117 1997655 When I was 16, I used to work<br />in a theatre as a projectionist,
1997746 2003367 and I worked for this guy<br />who literally collected, not pornography,
2003460 2006873 but he collected the most bizarre...
2006963 2013963 He collected frames from movies.<br />He had the anamorphic squeezed breasts
2015847 2019465 from the body double in <i>Dressed</i> To <i>Kill.</i>
2019559 2022927 And he had, like, Nancy Allen's panties.
2023021 2026730 Like, a shot of the joystick in the B-25,
2026816 2029433 and Nancy Allen's panties in <i>1941.</i>
2029528 2034022 He had all these, like,<br />little tiny shavings from films.
2034115 2039736 They weren't even like girlie magazines.<br />They were, like, so kind of...
2040872 2042454 They were so innocent.
2042541 2045078 He had this whole collection<br />in an envelope
2045168 2046829 that was taped up to the window.
2046920 2050208 I remember just seeing this collection<br />grow and grow and grow.
2051383 2056093 Bizarre. But I remember reading the book<br />and laughing out loud because it's so true.
2056179 2063179 Projectionists have weird little proclivities<br />that they, you know, expand upon.
2064521 2068981 Nobody knew Brad was gonna do his big<br />jumping thing so he goes out of frame.
2069067 2072810 But I love the idea of a character<br />who just leaps out of the frame
2072904 2077364 to prepare themselves<br />for this really stupid shot.
2088837 2095379 I remember we came to Long Beach<br />to shoot this sequence,
2095468 2102090 and I had said, "I need just, like,<br />a regular old... an old beat-up car."
2102183 2104515 "Just find me some old beat-up car."
2104603 2107721 And we got down there<br />and there's this station wagon.
2107814 2111978 I thought,<br />"That station wagon looks really familiar."
2112068 2115982 And I walked up to the windshield
2116072 2121363 and it had a sticker on it that said CRS,<br />it was one of the vehicles from The Game.
2121453 2125412 It's actually the car that James Rebhorn
2125498 2128490 takes Michael Douglas<br />into the CRS parking garage in.
2128585 2133375 I was just, like,<br />"Oh, you cannot get away from the past."
2164913 2170033 This is a house that we built in...<br />It's down in Long Beach at the...
2170126 2173585 It's probably gone now.<br />I know the house is gone...
2173672 2178508 It was, like, six blocks. It was gonna<br />be redeveloped as the new port.
2179052 2185924 And so we got this deal on this empty lot<br />and we built this house. And it was wild.
2186017 2191012 We went down there one day<br />to look at the progress of the house.
2191106 2196067 It was basically, like, acres and acres<br />of land that's all gonna be torn down.
2196152 2200521 There were all these, like, you know,<br />scrap-metal dealerships
2200615 2203277 and car-repair places.
2203368 2206906 And so we started building<br />this Victorian facade there.
2206996 2210534 I remember one day, the sun was setting,<br />people were driving by.
2210625 2213208 They could see people<br />constructing this house.
2213294 2217413 And this guy rolled his window down,<br />and said: "I don't know if you know this,
2217507 2220966 I don't know who sold you this land,<br />but they're gonna..."
2221052 2225387 He was concerned that we'd been ripped<br />off, that we were building this house
2225473 2229558 on this piece of land that was<br />gonna be reclaimed by the port authority.
2229644 2234810 And we were, like, "No, no, no.<br />It's okay. We were aware of that."
2257005 2262671 Michael Kaplan, who did the costumes,<br />brought me this photograph of Brad
2262761 2266755 in this red leather jacket<br />that he found in this thrift store.
2266848 2271888 I looked at it and thought, "Red. It's a little<br />loud." And he's, like, "It's 3 Tyler thing."
2271978 2274515 "Tyler should really be the kind of guy
2274606 2278770 "who doesn't understand<br />how loud his clothing is."
2278860 2282774 And that was Brad's take too,<br />he just doesn't care.
2282864 2288906 I mean, he just... he has no idea that<br />wearing rust-colored polyester pants
2288995 2295162 and tan Gucci loafers and a bright red<br />leather jacket is in bad taste.
2295251 2298664 And so I kind of went along<br />with this thing, thinking:
2298755 2301873 "If that's the way it's gonna be,<br />then that's fine."
2301966 2305709 I remember seeing a photograph<br />of the Halloween parade
2305804 2308387 on Santa Monica Boulevard in Boys Town.
2308473 2313718 And there were, like,<br />25 guys in red leather jackets
2313812 2316474 looking like Tyler Durden<br />as part of the parade.
2316564 2322276 It was very, very funny.<br />I thought, "Well, there's our movement."
2335500 2340370 I love the idea of having a house big<br />enough you can ride a bicycle through it.
2382881 2386465 It was supposed to take place<br />in the backyard.
2386551 2390966 They were gonna be on their backs,<br />looking up at this old rusted-up swing set
2391055 2396050 that it looked like a complete disaster<br />for children to ever play on.
2396144 2400729 They were laying there, smoking<br />and drinking and looking up at the sky.
2400815 2405730 When we got there to shoot that, there<br />was so much noise and so many problems
2405820 2409279 and, you know, we couldn't<br />put the cameras where we wanted to.
2409365 2414075 We ended up shooting this kind of...<br />it was a sort of vague version of it.
2414162 2418326 And then, later on,<br />as we were completing the film,
2418416 2425004 they were about to tear down the big<br />Paper Street interior set at stage 16, Fox.
2425131 2428340 I thought, "We'll never shoot in here again.
2428426 2430758 "Is there a scene we<br />could've staged better?"
2430845 2434839 I remembered that scene. I never really<br />liked the way that it turned out.
2435016 2439510 It was too posed.<br />And then I got this idea that...
2439604 2442938 I love the idea that Tyler<br />is so comfortable with himself,
2443024 2446358 not only in what he wears,<br />but that he could just be naked.
2446444 2449527 And it wouldn't be like<br />you'd be on the phone:
2449614 2452072 "Oh, my God,<br />my roommate is naked again."
2452158 2456322 He just doesn't care that they<br />could actually be dressing wounds while...
2456412 2459905 that Edward could be<br />dressing his bruised knuckles
2459999 2464960 while, you know, Brad was in the bathtub,<br />scrubbing in this disgusting water.
2465046 2468164 So we went back in,<br />and we shot it in a half-day.
2468257 2473969 Just set up two cameras<br />and had a chance to resuscitate it.
2474055 2477969 A lot of moviemaking is fucking things up<br />so that you can then go:
2478059 2479970 "This is what it should be."
2480061 2484146 Every time I hear about<br />how Woody Allen shoots for six weeks,
2484232 2487816 and then goes down for six weeks<br />and cuts the film,
2487902 2491236 then shoots for six weeks,<br />you go, "That is the way to do it,"
2491322 2496237 because the preconceived<br />notion, often times,
2497078 2498660 is the thing that<br />makes movies feel so stilted.
2498746 2502114 I don't know how great it is now,<br />but it's much better than it was.
2502208 2504165 It just seemed so precious.
2504252 2506835 And then, all of a sudden,<br />it was, like, "Whoa."
2506921 2511381 "We can walk up here before they tear<br />this thing down and bang this thing off."
2511467 2515506 Often it's living with stuff so you go,<br />"No, no. This is what it should be."
2515596 2520090 There's so much time and energy spent<br />making a decision and getting specific
2520184 2524428 and hemming yourself in, because<br />there's so many ways that a scene can go.
2524522 2527435 There's so many different ways<br />to skin a cat.
2527525 2531894 You find yourself going, "We'll do that<br />because we're gonna be in that area,
2531988 2535526 and we'll do it in this way, and..."<br />And a lot of times, it's...
2535616 2538074 We shot the scene<br />in the backyard because
2538161 2541495 we loved the way the backyard looked,
2541581 2548374 and then finally, once it was done, it was<br />kinda like, "This is stupid. Let's fix it."
2659991 2661948 There's a scene coming up<br />at the food court
2662034 2665243 where he's having a salad and an iced tea.
2665371 2671333 I love this image of Edward. He had this<br />very specific idea about the sunglasses,
2671419 2674081 so we had to wait for these sunglasses
2674172 2676254 to come over from his trailer<br />'cause he had these...
2676340 2680709 I was, like, "Sunglasses. Who gives a<br />shit?" And we're waiting and waiting.
2680803 2685263 His assistant runs and gives him the<br />glasses, he puts them on and looks like...
2685349 2688808 It's <i>so</i> great <i>'cause it's a half-assed<br />Mission: Impossible...</i>
2688936 2692600 They're trying to be cool,<br />but they're just not right.
2692690 2694977 You look at him and go, "Exactly right,"
2695067 2697900 because it's just the image<br />of a guy in this grey suit
2697987 2703073 with this Adam's apple and this bruise<br />and these kind of trendy sunglasses.
2703159 2706197 It says great things about<br />the secret society of Fight Club.
2706287 2708198 It just always cracked me up.
2735775 2738893 In the fight scene<br />where Brad pummels a guy's nuts,
2738986 2742195 we got that from<br />Ultimate Fighting Championship.
2742323 2747489 When we were viewing tapes, we were<br />looking at what the fights should look like.
2747578 2749569 If people really want to win fights,
2749664 2752747 it's a different thing than<br />when they're trying to box
2752833 2755200 or if it's kind of professional fighting.
2755294 2760004 In the Ultimate Fighting Championships<br />you have guys with different disciplines.
2760091 2763755 Some of them are boxers<br />and some of them are street brawlers
2763844 2766802 and some of them are,<br />like, Gracie jujitsu guys.
2766889 2769506 It's always really interesting to watch that.
2769600 2773138 So we looked at a lot of it, and it was raw.
2773229 2775846 The fighting <i>was...</i><br />And the people bleed so <i>much.</i>
2775940 2781606 When you see a guy get his nose broken<br />with the palm of somebody else's hand,
2781696 2784814 and their nose moves an inch and a half<br />across their face,
2784907 2788525 it's completely different<br />from watching Evander Holyfield,
2788619 2790906 although there's good things in that too.
2790997 2795833 But I remember this thing where this guy<br />just pummeled this other guy's nuts, and
2795918 2801129 I was just looking at Brad, and he was just<br />going, "We gotta get that in somewhere."
2801215 2805584 That's about the most effective way<br />to win a fight.
2831495 2835159 I love the sentiment of this,<br />that the Mona <i>Lisa</i> is falling apart,
2835249 2838742 that, you know, there's only<br />two constants, entropy and chaos,
2840755 2844589 and I always wanted the film<br />to embody that.
2846135 2850925 There's entropy and then,<br />cut to Marla, there's chaos.
2858481 2861940 I love how she always has things<br />wrapped around her neck
2862026 2865644 or she's always kind of throttling herself<br />or choking on smoke,
2865780 2870570 or perched on these dangerous shoes<br />and walking into traffic.
2871118 2875077 She's a very, very gifted actress<br />and when I explained to her this scene,
2875164 2877326 she was, like,<br />"It's all close-ups of my face?"
2877416 2880158 I said, "But you're gonna<br />be moving around."
2880252 2884211 "Your head's over the side of the bed,<br />then you sit up into this close-up,
2884298 2888257 "then flop down into this close-up,<br />then roll into this other close-up."
2888344 2890676 She was so amazing at it.
2890805 2894048 And she just cracks me up.
2894141 2897805 And, for somebody<br />who's this extraordinarily beautiful,
2897895 2903186 she is so not interested in<br />presenting herself in a beautiful way.
2903317 2907151 She would have the makeup artist<br />put her eye makeup on with her left hand
2907279 2912570 'cause she was, like, "Marla wouldn't know<br />how to do eyeliner right, so try this."
2912660 2915368 So she would come in<br />with giant smears of eyeliner
2915454 2917411 and fake eyelashes<br />stuck to her cheekbone.
2920418 2923206 She was pretty hilarious.
2932680 2935297 I don't know how to shoot<br />sex scenes or ask people to...
2935391 2937553 It seems embarrassing and silly.
2937643 2941637 I can't imagine... Pornography seems to me<br />to be a little bit more honest.
2941730 2946270 It'd be easier for me to shoot pornography<br />than to shoot the love scene from Top <i>Gun,</i>
2946360 2950945 'cause I'd just go, "I don't know how to<br />do this." I don't know how to, you know...
2951031 2954569 "Okay, you really need to moan,<br />but you need to moan lovingly."
2954660 2958779 You know, it's just awful.<br />Do people, like, lick each other's throats?
2958873 2961080 Or do they... What are they gonna do?
2961167 2964751 So we were really...<br />I was actually kind of, like, scared.
2964837 2966669 I didn't know how to approach it.
2966755 2970123 And then I saw this Rolling Stones video
2970217 2974085 that Michel Gondry did<br />and Harry Savides shot.
2974221 2978215 It was all these still cameras,<br />and it's a technique we've seen since then
2978309 2984396 and it was used pretty effectively in The<br /><i>Matrix</i> and a lot of television commercials.
2984482 2990728 But I just thought... I mean, I just couldn't<br />bring myself to ask people to feign that,
2990821 2992983 so I thought, at least if we did it this way...
2993073 2996191 'Cause it's supposed to be kind of a dream.
2996285 2999243 In an odd way, it's not supposed<br />to represent what happened,
2999330 3001867 just what he remembers,
3001957 3008957 and it's supposed to be easily confused<br />with his obsessive thoughts about her.
3009298 3012416 So I thought maybe this would be<br />a sort of heightened reality,
3012510 3014251 so we ended up doing this.
3014345 3016427 I mean, it ended up being even weirder
3016555 3020924 'cause you have actors who are ostensibly<br />naked, and they're covered with dots.
3021018 3023100 You have to put dots all over them.
3023187 3026680 Brad, because his skin was darker,<br />had white dots all over him,
3026774 3030062 and Helena had black dots all over her.
3030152 3034191 We would plot the course the camera<br />was gonna move with still cameras,
3034281 3039492 and then fire the still cameras, and they<br />would be in the throes of some orgasmic...
3039578 3042411 So it ended up just as awful<br />as having to shoot it.
3042498 3045786 But, still, at least you could<br />hide behind all these cameras
3045876 3049870 and come out with a slide rule and take<br />measurements of people's eyebrows
3049964 3054049 and make it seem like you weren't<br />looking at the crack of their ass.
3054134 3056876 It ended up being very, very weird.
3056971 3059258 With actors that people know,
3059348 3062215 you have to be so careful<br />where the negatives get processed
3062309 3066644 and who handles <i>stuff,</i> and make sure<br />it doesn't end up at <i>Entertainment</i> Weekly.
3066730 3069688 So you have all these,<br />you know, security issues.
3069775 3073063 They're naked<br />and there's cameras all around them.
3073153 3078819 We, like, strategically positioned<br />where sheets and stuff were, but still.
3078909 3081276 It would've been an interesting photo op.
3081370 3085489 So we ended up doing this thing<br />and it becomes very clinical, you know.
3085583 3091124 It was more about this technique than,<br />"More thrusting. More moaning."
3173003 3176121 The shot of the condoms in the toilet
3176215 3179378 was the one thing that we...
3179468 3182927 ..we ended up<br />getting studio notes on.
3183013 3186005 It was the one thing they said,<br />"You cannot have this.
3186100 3188262 "This is just awful, these condoms."
3188352 3192971 I remember getting these condoms<br />and filling them with, like, cream rinse,
3193065 3196933 and twisting them off and trying to get<br />them to float in this toilet.
3197027 3200565 We shot ten takes of it and everybody<br />was, like, "You have enough."
3200656 3204069 It's funny, the things<br />people are offended by.
3205285 3209495 You'd think, in a movie like this, that<br />would be the least of anyone's worries,
3209581 3211618 the condoms floating in the toilet.
3211750 3215709 Then you cut to the next scene,<br />which is Edward eating out of Tupperware,
3215796 3221542 and so many people<br />drew the Eisenstein conclusion
3221635 3225629 that he was eating condoms. So...
3227391 3231635 The human mind.<br />It works in such mysterious ways.
3240738 3243070 A little homage <i>to Blade Runner,</i>
3243157 3246070 all the water pouring down the walls.
3251165 3253076 This was one of my<br />favorite scenes to shoot,
3253167 3256580 this moment when Edward comes upstairs
3256670 3262962 and he looks into the room. He's got to be<br />shockingly curious about what is going on,
3263051 3266669 'cause she's having this,<br />like, minute-long orgasm,
3266764 3271884 and it's human behavior<br />to want to find out what is going on.
3272019 3274761 And then the fact<br />that Brad completely busts him.
3274855 3277973 And then, this was Brad's idea,<br />the rubber glove,
3278066 3281058 where he points and says,<br />"You want to finish her off?"
3281195 3283277 I remember the studio came back saying,
3283363 3286606 "You have to get rid of that.<br />There's no way."
3286700 3288862 "That is not funny. It is too awful."
3288952 3292661 And we shot the day's dailies<br />and we only printed that one take.
3292748 3297914 Laura Ziskin, who from the beginning said,<br />"You have to cut this. This is just awful."
3298003 3301871 "No one is gonna think it's funny."<br />She had never seen the rubber glove.
3301965 3306425 Everybody in dailies fell out of their chairs<br />laughing and she was so mortified,
3306512 3310255 but she called me and said,<br />"You had to put a rubber glove on him."
3310390 3315430 I said, "That was Brad's idea. If you've got<br />a problem with it, call him. Call CAA."
3315521 3320732 It was probably the biggest laugh<br />in preview screenings.
3320984 3322691 It should be a little bit shocking.
3322778 3325440 I don't know. That kind of stuff<br />doesn't really shock me,
3325531 3328068 but it got good nervous laughter.
3333247 3338959 In the original script, it was a line that was<br />taken from the book. Marla has this line.
3339044 3344255 In the flashback scene where Tyler's<br />recalling his evening spent with Marla,
3344383 3348342 he quotes her where she says:
3348428 3351420 "I wanna get pregnant.<br />I wanna have your abortion."
3351515 3355930 And this was a line<br />that everybody had problems with.
3356019 3359853 And it was in the book<br />and I always felt that it was such a great...
3359940 3363649 Because I always thought of Maria<br />as being this romantic nihilist.
3363777 3367361 She's almost pretending to be<br />more extreme than what she really is
3367447 3370360 in order to kind of challenge Tyler.
3370868 3373200 It's a line that we shot. We were...
3373287 3376780 We fought for it and we shot it<br />and everyone hated it.
3376874 3379491 Everyone thought it was just awful.
3379626 3383039 Tyler remembers it and he laughs about it.<br />He does this...
3383130 3385747 ..as he's lighting his cigarette.
3385841 3389800 When we previewed it for an audience,
3389887 3392254 it was a huge laugh.
3392347 3396432 Laura Ziskin, who hated it, came up to me<br />afterwards and said,
3396643 3397758 "You're absolutely right."
3397853 3402563 "It's one of the funniest lines and people<br />laughed, but, please, do me a favor."
3402649 3406813 "Will you shoot something to cover it<br />in case we get into censorship issues,
3406904 3409487 "or if we have problems in the Bible Belt?
3409573 3413237 "Can you please do something?"<br />I said, "I'll make a deal with you."
3413327 3417867 "If I shoot something else,<br />you have to use it."
3417998 3420990 "I'm not gonna reshoot<br />'cause we got a big laugh from it,
3421084 3424702 "and if we're gonna reshoot,<br />it has to be something I'm happy with."
3424796 3429211 "And if I am, then you have to give me<br />the leeway to see it in the final movie."
3429301 3433260 She said, "You can shoot<br />anything you want, just replace that."
3433347 3437557 We had scheduled to reshoot the scene,<br />and the only place that we could do it
3437643 3443309 was at the end of a reshoot schedule.<br />We were shooting in a church.
3443398 3445810 The only place that<br />we could set up our bed
3445901 3449815 and lights and everything<br />was in the rectory.
3449905 3452693 So I brought the actors in<br />and started to rehearse,
3452783 3457619 and they're literally surrounded<br />by, like, gowns and crucifixes.
3457704 3463791 I mean, it was the most inappropriate<br />place to have this line about abortion.
3463877 3466619 So I was, like,<br />"I can't ask them to do that again."
3466713 3470957 "I can't do something about abortion<br />in here. We're all gonna go to hell."
3471051 3476387 So Brad and Helena and I<br />came up with this idea that she...
3476473 3482389 I came up with "I haven't been fucked like<br />that since grade school", and she laughed.
3482479 3485346 So we went into the place,<br />they got in bed,
3485440 3489024 and we had this thing where<br />she was gonna fall back and say this line
3489111 3493070 and he was gonna just give her<br />this Ferris Bueller look to the camera,
3493156 3496239 like, "Wow. What have I stepped in here?"
3496326 3501742 And so she did the line and the crew just...<br />I mean, I don't think there's...
3501832 3504790 There's probably one more frame that we
3504876 3507664 could use before<br />the camera starts shaking.
3507754 3511793 The camera operator was laughing<br />and everybody started cracking up.
3511883 3514045 But she delivered it perfectly.
3514136 3518471 "My God. I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school."
3518557 3522767 So we cut it into the movie<br />and we did one last preview screening.
3522853 3524810 Afterwards, Laura Ziskin<br />came to me and said,
3524896 3528730 "Please, please, put<br />the abortion line back in.
3528817 3530899 "This is just awful."
3530986 3533819 But it was too late.
3545500 3549710 When Marla comes to Edward's character,<br />to the narrator, in the kitchen,
3549796 3553380 and does the thing<br />where she rubs up against him
3553467 3555959 and she puts her arm around him and...
3556053 3559796 I knew I wanted this thing<br />where she puts her hands on his stomach,
3559890 3563724 or she sort of threads her fingers together<br />and sort of holds him,
3563810 3566723 but she had this cigarette.<br />She said, "What do I do?"
3566813 3568724 So she did this.<br />She brought her hand around
3568815 3572183 and the cigarette became<br />this perfect kind of...
3572319 3576483 This tiny, thin, white phallic symbol,<br />just smoldering.
3576573 3580157 We wanted that to be the poster,<br />if we could get them to go for it.
3580243 3584578 But I loved him<br />in his little nasty white cotton boxers
3584664 3588498 with this smoldering cigarette<br />pointed out.
3588585 3594251 And that was just a Bonham Carterism.
3628416 3631909 So many weeks were spent on<br />trying to devise a material
3632003 3636748 that would look like liposuction fat.<br />The prop master, Bucky Moore, when I...
3636842 3640881 I had offices in Hollywood<br />where we were starting to prep the movie,
3640971 3646341 and every day, at 3:00 in the afternoon,<br />he would bring up biohazard bags
3646434 3648801 filled with different kinds<br />of liposuction material.
3648895 3651227 Some of it was fat, some was...
3651314 3654773 There would be collagen<br />and all these different things.
3654901 3657359 He'd bring these bags in<br />and it was so revolting,
3657445 3661530 but seeing these things every day,<br />you get inured to the whole thing.
3661616 3668238 It doesn't mean anything to you<br />after a while. They were trying to concoct
3668331 3670618 these phony versions of<br />whatever this material looked like.
3670709 3675454 And it kind of looked like chicken skin<br />and sort of rubber cement,
3675547 3680462 mixed with a bit of blood and snot and<br />all this stuff. It was just horrifying.
3680552 3683635 So they came up with<br />this concoction that...
3683722 3689308 You know, I'd pretty much kind of<br />exhausted any revolting quality that it had,
3689686 3693179 or any revolting spell it cast.<br />I remember going to shoot that scene,
3693273 3697392 and they climb over the thing<br />and the bags rip and the stuff spills out,
3697485 3701854 and the crew just...<br />They were close to vomiting.
3701948 3704406 I remember thinking,<br />"Hm. This is gonna work."
3704492 3707951 'Cause it just looked to me like,<br />"That stuff's a little stringy.
3708038 3709654 "That's a little too orange."
3709748 3715960 But as soon as it ripped open and all the<br />camera assistants had their gag reflexes,
3716296 3719459 that's when I knew<br />we were onto something.
3757837 3762798 Chuck is truly a fucking genius.
3762884 3766843 I mean, he's, like, got this whole...<br />He's really thought this stuff out.
3766930 3771094 He's really... The book is so much<br />more intricate than the movie.
3771184 3774427 The movie's a pale imitation.
3774771 3780016 He really understands the sociology of it<br />in a profound way.
3780110 3785446 And Uhls, of course,<br />had the completely despicable task
3785532 3788615 of trying to take all these things<br />that had been...
3788702 3793947 I mean, it's a 240-page or 250-page book.<br />You know, it's very dense.
3794040 3799080 It's kind of surface and glib. He touches<br />on these things in such a great way
3799170 3802663 that you only retain the things<br />that he needs you to know.
3802757 3807376 Then, when you finally find out, "God, this<br />person never existed", and you go back,
3807512 3810755 you realize it's so much deeper<br />than you ever thought.
3810849 3812465 But Uhls really figured this shit out.
3812559 3818180 He really, like, went through and figured<br />out the scenes that were the best...
3818273 3820480 you know, the best use of screen time.
3820567 3823776 It's kind of amazing.<br />He did an amazing job.
3836082 3839825 We started off with the idea<br />that we would only see Tyler in singles.
3839919 3843162 He would never be in a two-shot unless<br />it was with Edward,
3843256 3845623 always over Edward to see him.
3845717 3850462 But we kind of ended up abandoning that<br />because it didn't seem necessary.
3850597 3853931 The end of the scene<br />where the guy with the shaved head,
3854017 3857510 when he pounds Edward's face<br />into the floor,
3857604 3861222 and then when he gets up,<br />Tyler says, "Okay, new guy, you're next."
3861316 3865605 But no one's really looking at him.<br />You just see, you know...
3865695 3867936 So I think it's all pretty airtight.
3868031 3871274 There's definitely...<br />The car scene is the big cheat,
3871368 3875202 but we get that out of the way.<br />That could be a figment of his imagination.
3875288 3878326 Certainly there's enough other things.
3893348 3899264 This scene, when the boss has found the<br />rules of Fight Club in the Xerox machine,
3899354 3902563 it's a scene in the book<br />and a scene that was in the script,
3902649 3908144 and we always thought it was really funny,<br />the idea of Edward Norton as Travis Bickle.
3908238 3912778 You know, this guy<br />who's right on the verge of exploding.
3912867 3917282 And it was one of those things<br />that was really, really, really funny,
3917372 3919909 until Columbine.
3919999 3923583 All of a sudden, this scene<br />took on this completely different...
3923670 3927880 It was one of the scenes where, when<br />we showed it to people, they would laugh.
3928007 3932592 The notion of Edward physically<br />threatening the boss was a funny one.
3932679 3936513 And then we had the Columbine massacre<br />and this scene became...
3936599 3942595 It was amazing to watch, you know, how<br />public opinion gets swayed by tragedy.
3942689 3946353 When we started previews,<br />of course, it wasn't funny anymore.
3946443 3949856 People were really very uncomfortable<br />and very nervous.
3949946 3953985 But it was a scene we couldn't lift<br />because it has the phone call from Marla
3954075 3959195 and him going off<br />to find the lump in her breast.
3960248 3963866 It was a scene where you're<br />painted into a narrative corner.
3963960 3967419 We couldn't really lose<br />the scene after that.
4004417 4009378 This is a hotel that we found in downtown<br />LA that we really liked, the Hotel Bristol,
4009464 4013173 and I thought it had<br />a very sort of New York feel, or urban feel.
4013259 4016297 It didn't have the horizontal expanse
4016429 4019547 that you normally associate,<br />pictorially, with LA.
4019641 4025387 It seemed kind of vertical, and seemed like<br />a late '303 or late '203 apartment building.
4025480 4028893 So we were shooting there<br />and I thought it was a great find.
4028983 4035150 It was like "Wow, the Hotel Bristol is really<br />a little goldmine that we stumbled upon."
4035240 4038449 And then, literally,<br />the night after we shot this,
4038535 4044247 I was watching HBO and Gia,<br />that Angelina Jolie movie, was on.
4044332 4048621 The whole thing's shot out in front of<br />the Hotel Bristol. I was, like, "Oh!"
4048711 4054502 There's just nothing that hasn't been<br />seen to death in Los Angeles.
4074654 4077191 I love the scene where Bob<br />comes back into the movie
4077282 4081025 because I love the energy Meat has.
4081119 4084612 He's so sweet.<br />He's so happy to see him, he really is.
4084706 4088665 And his life has really kind of<br />gotten back on the right track.
4088751 4092085 He's really discovered this thing<br />that's changed his life.
4092171 4096665 I love the irony that, indeed,<br />he's picked up on Fight Club.
4096759 4100172 He's now part of<br />another chapter of Fight Club
4100263 4103506 that Edward, or the narrator,<br />doesn't even know about.
4103600 4106058 This was the beginning<br />of planting the seeds
4106144 4112481 that this thing is bigger than Tyler and the<br />narrator, or bigger than Brad and Edward.
4112567 4117653 And Meat, he's so funny in it.<br />He has this incredible charm.
4122035 4126620 And, of course, we gave him the requisite<br />kind of, you know, fat guy stuff.
4126706 4130950 He's got his carton of doughnuts<br />that he's eating in the middle of the night
4131044 4133706 as he's wandering along the streets.
4133796 4140543 When we cast Meat Loaf, I had always had<br />this image of him as a 310-pound guy.
4140678 4146720 Of course, when I met him, he's almost<br />twiggy compared to how you think of him,
4146809 4149597 so we actually had to make<br />this fat suit for him.
4149687 4152475 Not only so he'd have breasts,<br />but also the girth,
4152565 4158436 'cause the love handles that spill over<br />his jeans and his jugs are all fake.
4158529 4162864 So he has this suit that he wears<br />that's filled with birdseed.
4162950 4166488 I wanted to have Rob Bottin<br />make us an appliance
4166579 4171449 so he could fight with his top off. We were<br />gonna make this, like, rubber suit,
4171542 4177379 or flexible, like, skinlike suit, so you could<br />see him with his tits flapping down,
4177465 4181459 but we decided that was too much.
4181594 4185508 But Meat Loaf would wear this<br />and do fight scenes, and it was so heavy.
4185598 4188215 He would just be drenched in sweat<br />after every take
4188685 4193350 'cause he was flopping around with<br />50, 60 extra pounds of, like, birdseed
4193439 4197854 in these giant burlap sacks<br />that were attached to his chest.
4198319 4200401 So in between setups,
4200488 4204197 they would rush out there with oxygen<br />masks and put them on him.
4204283 4206695 I was convinced we were gonna kill him
4206786 4210871 with all the jumping around<br />and fight stuff that he had to do,
4210957 4215167 'cause he was incredible, trying to do<br />these choreographed fight scenes.
4215253 4217665 Actually, there's a scene later on
4217755 4220918 when they start handing out<br />the homework assignments,
4221008 4225002 and you see Brad handing out envelopes.<br />And in the background, it's dark,
4225138 4229848 but you can see Meat with a little<br />blood pressure cuff, like, around his arm.
4229976 4233844 There's a giant bottle of oxygen<br />and he's got the mask to his face
4233938 4237602 and he's sucking on it<br />as these guys exit Lou's Tavern.
4237692 4241230 We thought that would be great,<br />that one of the guys in Fight Club
4241320 4246815 worked in a dentist's office<br />and brought this oxygen.
4306052 4311673 This was a particularly horrific fight<br />to shoot, when Lou comes in.
4311766 4315509 Not the punching out of Brad,<br />but this wasn't in the book,
4315603 4319096 but we were trying to find a scene,<br />sort of the Nuremberg Rally,
4319232 4321599 where Tyler kind of addresses the troops,
4321734 4325978 and you get to see the "We're<br />the middle children of history" speech.
4326072 4331283 He's kind of indoctrinating them, and<br />he's sort of giving them his take on things.
4331369 4334828 Then Lou comes in and beats him up.
4334914 4337531 I didn't want the Christian<br />"turn the other cheek".
4337625 4339832 I wanted to modernize that in some way,
4339919 4342911 but I love the idea that<br />we live in a time and place
4343005 4345292 where if you were standing in a line
4345383 4349251 and somebody came by and brandished<br />a gun, that would be frightening,
4349345 4351757 but not as frightening as if somebody took
4351848 4354385 a test tube of blood<br />and spattered you with it.
4354475 4358389 You'd be almost more shocked<br />and horrified by that.
4358479 4362643 I definitely wanted to get in<br />the idea to turn the other cheek
4362775 4366393 to this AIDS generation extreme.
4391178 4394637 Peter Iacangelo, the actor who plays Lou,
4394724 4398433 you know, had to lie there<br />for five or six hours
4398519 4400760 while Brad spewed fake blood,
4400855 4404769 but he was spitting and it's coming<br />out of his nose all over this guy,
4404859 4410025 and it's spattering him in the mouth,<br />and in his eyes, and it's just horrifying.
4410156 4416072 And, you know, after about five hours,<br />I mean, he was truly fed up with us.
4416871 4419989 He did not want to shoot one more take.
4422501 4425835 You only see it for a bit,<br />but it was hours of shooting
4425963 4430048 with blood just spraying<br />out of Brad's hairline,
4430176 4433089 and out of his ears and nose and mouth.
4433179 4435921 Between every take,<br />you'd have to clean him off
4436015 4438803 and get him a new shirt and redo his hair.
4438893 4443854 So it was just<br />a monumental continuity nightmare.
4498202 4503993 This is a funny scene.<br />Stuart, who plays the Cadillac dealer,
4504083 4508077 we actually got him to kick his loafer off
4508170 4512334 at exactly the right moment as he gets<br />pushed over the hood of the Eldorado.
4512425 4515793 He actually became<br />incredibly proficient at this.
4515928 4520673 He'd ask, "How high do you want it?" I was<br />like, "12 feet. It's the top of the frame."
4520766 4524179 He could kick that Gucci loafer up in the air
4524270 4526227 and ask you,<br />"How many spins do you want?"
4526313 4530898 "You want a half gain?" or whatever.<br />He got so good at it.
4530985 4536856 In the scene where Holt hits Matt Winston,<br />who's the priest, as he's running away,
4536949 4541944 the camera bounces at that point because<br />the camera operator started laughing.
4542038 4545030 This was take three.<br />We didn't know what would happen.
4545124 4547456 We'd walked him through it,<br />you saw him spray it,
4548169 4552584 and in the close-up camera, which is a<br />300 mm lens, the operator starts laughing.
4552673 4554880 Then in the wide shot,<br />as he pans over with them,
4554967 4559837 as he hits them, he starts laughing<br />and the camera bounces.
4575529 4579523 In this scene, we ended up<br />doing a reshoot of this for Edward's side
4579658 4584448 because we kind of got a different idea<br />on how Edward should play this,
4584538 4587280 so we went back in<br />and reshot Edward's profile.
4587374 4593336 In the interim between the first time we'd<br />been in this building and the reshoot,
4593422 4596835 they'd changed the thermostat<br />on the wall behind it
4596967 4599925 so it wasn't silver any more, it was black.
4600012 4603721 The walls were the color we<br />painted them, but every time I look,
4603849 4609811 I see the thermostat in the background<br />change from being black to being silver.
4632628 4634995 The stunt stuff in here is really,
4635089 4639925 except for actually hitting<br />the coffee table, is Edward,
4640010 4643344 and he really just<br />knocked himself off his feet,
4643430 4645671 and he's pretty amazing at it.
4645766 4651728 He could do this Fosbury flop, like, from a<br />standing position, that was truly amazing.
4671500 4675869 Originally when we were shooting this,<br />we got off on the Jerry Lewis thing,
4675963 4680878 I was always wondering whether it would<br />work, but a lot of people love this scene
4680968 4686008 and think it's very, very funny. I just<br />worried that it wasn't violent enough.
4686098 4690638 But I love it when he hits himself. He's in<br />that moment of pause, sitting there,
4690728 4694972 then he just hauls off and cracks himself<br />in the face two more times.
4695065 4697682 We rigged this tube<br />on the side of his nose.
4697776 4700438 We had a guy behind him,<br />spraying blood out
4700529 4705114 because you can't have blood tubes too far<br />from the source of their blood bottles.
4705201 4710241 So we actually had somebody<br />crawl along the floor after Edward,
4710331 4712493 squirting blood out.
4733646 4737981 There's a lot of things in the corner of<br />frames. I like when Edward's been fired,
4738067 4740479 he's taking this fax machine<br />and computers,
4740569 4745655 all these things he's stolen from his office.<br />It's a sort of bizarre form of severance.
4745741 4749860 He's wandering down the hallway,<br />and you see Eion Bailey, who plays Ricky,
4749954 4753788 who's in the corner of the frame,<br />and he's got this look on his face.
4753874 4756957 He's watching Edward<br />and he's so impressed with him.
4757044 4762665 I love those little tiny things<br />in the background that someday...
4762758 4764840 someday, someone will see it.
4778399 4781141 This is where Brad's<br />handing out the envelopes
4781235 4785524 and right there in the back, under that<br />light, is Meat Loaf with a mask on,
4785614 4788402 sucking oxygen out of an oxygen bottle.
4789451 4793240 This was one of the first shots we did.<br />We ended up reshooting it because
4793330 4799246 we couldn't see that the guys were<br />destroying satellite dishes, so we redid it.
4800546 4804881 The erasing of the tapes was
4804967 4807550 one of those scenes that<br />we didn't think people would get,
4807636 4812597 the idea of taking a bulk degausser and<br />degaussing tapes that are on the shelf,
4812683 4815220 but it turned out a lot of people laughed.
4815311 4818053 A lot more people understood<br />the degaussing thing
4818147 4821811 better than we could have anticipated.
4828741 4834487 This scene was... We had the Range Rover<br />in the back, which is the first car they hit,
4834580 4838369 then they hit a BMW,<br />then they go past the little Hyundai,
4838459 4842669 and then they come upon<br />the Volkswagen Beetle, the New Beetle,
4842755 4846123 and Edward was adamant<br />that they have to hit the New Beetle
4846258 4852254 because he's so angered<br />by the idea of baby-boomers
4852348 4857969 recycling their own kind of<br />historical references.
4858103 4860811 So he was, like, "I gotta beat that car up."
4860898 4866860 I think we rented all these cars<br />and then we returned them all bashed in.
4898727 4901344 We had this different order to the scenes.
4901480 4905314 Originally Edward quits his job,<br />beats himself up,
4905401 4907392 then comes back and tells Brad about it,
4907486 4911730 and then the next scene is Brad<br />kind of giving the Nuremberg Rally,
4911824 4915408 then being beaten up by Lou,<br />sort of escalating the whole thing.
4915494 4922494 But it didn't end up working as well as Lou<br />coming beforehand, because it seemed...
4922835 4925918 The escalation<br />is sort of more clever in its escalation
4926004 4930373 because you saw somebody get beaten up<br />in a very kind of crude, base kind of way,
4930509 4933843 and then Brad bleed all over him<br />and say, you know:
4933971 4936087 "You don't know where I've been, Lou."
4936181 4939674 And then to see that<br />taken into the workaday world,
4939768 4941429 it sort of seemed to work better.
4941520 4947061 There's a tension when Edward comes in<br />and says to the boss, "We have to talk."
4947192 4948853 You've seen them do all these things.
4948944 4952232 You've seen them pick fights<br />with people and lose,
4952364 4954856 and you're waiting for<br />something to happen.
4954950 4958818 We ended up losing two scenes<br />that connected the two things together.
4958912 4963657 But I loved the moment.<br />It was a great idea for a scene.
4963750 4967994 Edward returns and says, "I did this<br />great thing. I got beaten up by the boss."
4968088 4972503 Or, "I beat myself up and he ended up<br />giving me all this. Don't worry. I'm okay."
4972593 4975802 And Tyler's already thinking,<br />"We gotta take this thing up a notch."
4975929 4977511 It's never enough.
4977598 4981683 I love the idea of Edward<br />constantly trying to say, "Look what I did."
4981768 4984806 And Brad saying, "That's interesting,
4984897 4986763 "but I've got this other thing<br />I'm thinking about."
4986857 4990350 So there's that constant<br />kind of tension there with...
4990444 4994563 Every time the narrator thinks<br />he's sort of standing next to Tyler
4994656 4997819 and kind of can bask in...<br />they're both kind of equals,
4997910 5002074 Tyler's already thinking about this other<br />thing and how it can be executed.
5002164 5004451 And then the Raymond K Hessel scene,
5004541 5008409 as I told you, was the one that<br />Josh Donen told me about over the phone
5008504 5014090 that made me go,<br />"Well, I gotta read this book."
5055384 5058001 Brad and I had been talking about...
5058136 5064508 Since he read the book, we'd been talking<br />about this idea of Tyler's kind of madness.
5064601 5067719 You know, we see Tyler on his little rant
5067813 5069975 in the basement by himself,<br />just going, you know...
5070065 5077065 Kind of practicing or trying to consolidate<br />or make clearer his manifesto.
5077573 5080565 So we got this idea<br />of coming out of the explosion
5080659 5083947 where you could see the flames<br />still superimposed over Brad
5084037 5086574 as he's carrying tools<br />around the basement.
5086665 5089748 As the camera moves in<br />and he looks right in the camera,
5089835 5093169 he starts his, "You're not your job<br />or how much money you have,
5093297 5096255 or the contents of your wallet<br />or the car you drive."
5096341 5100835 We started going through this litany<br />of things that Tyler thinks that you...
5100929 5103011 Or is reminding you that you aren't.
5103098 5106181 It's almost like the intensity<br />of this moment
5106268 5110683 actually causes the film<br />to jump out of the gate in the projector.
5110814 5114808 So we had this idea and<br />we just shot it on the set really simply.
5114901 5118144 The camera just tracks in and then<br />Conrad Hall, the camera operator,
5118238 5121230 just started shaking the camera a little bit,
5121325 5125410 and shaking it back and forth on the<br />Panahead, whatever kind of looseness
5125495 5129079 there was in the gears,<br />he's shaking this camera like crazy.
5129166 5131703 We took it on a computer and steadied it
5131793 5135411 so Brad's nose stays<br />in the middle of the frame.
5135505 5139214 We tracked it with the computer,<br />and then we put the perforations
5139301 5143511 coming in on either side. It's amazing to<br />watch this with a projectionist
5143597 5146134 who's not aware that<br />this is gonna happen.
5146224 5149512 Invariably, when you look up<br />to the booth after this moment,
5149603 5152516 you see a guy running around in the booth,
5152606 5156975 crazily trying to figure out the problem,<br />what's wrong with his equipment.
5157069 5159982 There's always this moment of panic when<br />you walk back there.
5160072 5164908 They're in a sweat going:<br />"I don't know where that came from."
5165035 5169154 And we always had to tell them,<br />"No, that was supposed to be there."
5169247 5174617 <i>Why does a weaker person need to<br />latch on to a strong person? What is that?</i>
5174711 5176918 <i>What do you get out of it?</i>
5178840 5180456 <i>That's not the same thing.</i>
5180550 5185340 I love this scene, the way they all relate<br />to each other in this triangle conversation,
5185430 5191176 and I love the idea of Tyler listening in<br />on what they're talking about upstairs,
5191269 5194682 especially, you know,<br />with where we're going with the reveal.
5194773 5201019 I loved that she's completely intent<br />on the narrator and what he's saying,
5201113 5204777 and you get sort of derailed halfway<br />through with the kiss scar.
5204866 5208404 They're talking about this and<br />she's pumping him for information,
5208495 5214616 and Tyler's overhearing. And I love the<br />way that, at the end, he finishes off what...
5214710 5220547 It's the first time you see him as the<br />puppet master and Edward as the puppet.
5228306 5232641 The first time you see it, you think Marla<br />is just kind of this pathetic ho,
5232728 5234184 then, the second time, you go,
5234271 5238230 "God, she's trying to make this<br />work and this guy is nuts."
5238316 5240227 Yeah, I thought that stuff worked well.
5240318 5243561 It's funny because I'd never<br />seen The <i>Sixth</i> Sense,
5243655 5247398 and I finally saw it, like, two weeks ago,<br />and I was, like, "Oh!"
5247492 5252987 "No wonder people were ready for this.<br />They'd seen that movie."
5255751 5258334 I loved the idea of the scar.<br />I thought it was great.
5259087 5262296 We had Brad kiss pieces of paper<br />with lipstick on,
5262382 5264498 and we kept choosing, "That's the one."
5264593 5268006 Then Bottin went off<br />and he made this appliance
5268096 5274593 that was kind of the 3-D, kind of<br />flocked wallpaper version of the imprint,
5274686 5277769 then these things would be put on,<br />but there were people...
5277856 5279472 I remember doing press stuff
5279566 5284356 and a lot of people were talking about<br />the homosexual undertones of the movie,
5284446 5286858 which, I mean, again, once you're...
5286948 5290441 If you're working backwards<br />from where the thing's headed
5290535 5294574 and you know Tyler is a figment<br />of his imagination, Tyler doesn't exist,
5294664 5300831 then it's more of a self-love story, which,<br />I think, is more a product of our times,
5300921 5304789 than it is a homosexual love story.
5369281 5374526 When we went from a two-hour, 19-minute<br />movie to two-hour,15-minute movie,
5374619 5378578 something had to give,<br />so we tightened this stuff up, but it was...
5378665 5383626 I mean, it's really just a distillation<br />of the first cut, you know,
5383712 5386454 just trying to get it all in.
5386548 5391088 What's tough with movies is you become<br />interested in movies for certain scenes.
5391177 5393214 There are reasons why you go,
5393305 5395763 "This means something to me."<br />And everybody has...
5395849 5398967 Actors have different scenes<br />they can point to
5399060 5400926 that they say,<br />"That was the movie for me,"
5401021 5406357 or "That was the reason<br />for wanting to go on the quest."
5406443 5412689 But, you know,<br />I think this is pretty much the movie.
5412824 5417068 It's pretty much everything we shot.<br />A couple of scenes went by the wayside,
5417162 5419779 and maybe a couple more should go, but...
5419873 5425209 we tried to make all the stuff move<br />on screen as quickly as we could
5425337 5430582 and still give it the weight<br />that we felt that it needed.
5487023 5493360 I love this. Brad added this. He handed him<br />the beers and then swatted him on the ass.
5493446 5497815 It's a girlfriend moment. "Honey, you're<br />looking good. Take these to the boys."
5497909 5501573 But I love the sort of<br /><i>Animal House</i> kind of like...
5501663 5505782 All of a sudden, he comes home<br />and there's all these people watching TV.
5505875 5509118 He doesn't know any of them.<br />Or he's seen them around,
5509212 5511920 but he doesn't really know<br />what's going on.
5512048 5517339 I love the point where they begin to,<br />you know, move away from each other,
5517429 5522799 and Tyler begins to take this whole thing<br />to a different place.
5541703 5544991 Jeff Cronenweth and I talked a lot<br />about different movies.
5545081 5549450 We wanted to make sure that we had<br />a real kind of naturalistic approach.
5549586 5552499 I think the visual look of this movie,
5552589 5554375 in terms of its night exteriors and stuff,
5554466 5557174 has a lot more to do<br />with kind of run and gun.
5557302 5561762 <i>American Graffiti</i> we talked about because<br />there was nothing precious about it,
5561848 5566058 and yet it still had a real look to it.<br />It had a real cohesive look to it.
5566144 5571264 And yet it's not a movie that you associate<br />with, you know, spectacular night scenes,
5571357 5576102 and yet I think that the night scenes in it<br />are spectacular because they're so true.
5576196 5580611 They feel so real, like you're out in<br />the night on Fourth Street, San Rafael,
5580700 5582691 watching cars go by.
5582827 5589073 It never felt like, you know,<br />you've got a giant crane with Musco Lights
5589167 5591659 down the street, helping out.
5591753 5595838 It just always felt very naturalistic,<br />so that was a movie we talked about.
5595924 5601886 You know, we just didn't want it to be<br />beautiful. We didn't want it to seem too...
5602013 5605347 It had to feel like it was really happening.
5635046 5636787 I love the castration scene.
5636881 5641341 I love the idea that Tyler<br />doesn't just say what he's gonna do,
5641427 5643009 he literally goes...
5643096 5646839 He attacks this guy<br />who's done nothing to him.
5646933 5649425 Brad added the thing<br />where he punches him
5649519 5652227 in the solar plexus before he drags him off.
5652313 5654395 He wraps the necktie around his neck
5654482 5657691 and drags him by it,<br />because it should be scary.
5657777 5661395 Here's this guy who's puffing on cigars<br />and telling everybody:
5661489 5665448 "Yeah, we'll find out who these guys are<br />and we'll make 'em pay."
5665577 5668160 And I love the idea that you have
5668246 5672581 these crazed <i>Clockwork</i> Orange waiters<br />just assault him.
5672667 5678583 And I was initially going, you know,<br />"Well, this guy's... he's a geriatric."
5678673 5680914 "You can't attack him and wale on him."
5681009 5684127 He's, like, "No, no.<br />That's what Tyler would do."
5684220 5686587 "You gotta be worried for his safety."
5686681 5689013 And it was exactly right.
5689100 5692764 There's a moment where<br />the audience gets uncomfortable
5692854 5695562 with where this is all headed.
5711873 5715207 In the back of the scene<br />where the guys come out,
5715293 5718035 you can see Meat Loaf's pants fall off
5718129 5721622 'cause he's got love handles<br />that his pants are belted around.
5721716 5724925 Of course, every time he moves,<br />he has these giant pants
5725011 5727969 and they just fall to his ankles<br />in, like, two seconds,
5728097 5733513 then he has the wherewithal to stop and<br />grab them and pull them up and belt them.
5733603 5736766 But this was the best take<br />and so we just decided to go with it.
5737273 5743189 But you can see he's got, you know,<br />fake thigh pads on and fake leg fat.
5743321 5745562 But it's one of those funny things where
5745657 5747898 we shot the take and I said,<br />"Okay, that was it."
5747992 5751701 And Meat Loaf goes, "I don't know<br />if it bothers you, but in the back,
5751788 5754576 my pants fell off<br />and went straight to the ground."
5754666 5760378 We went back and shot four or five<br />more takes, but that was the best one.
5761506 5768003 This is a scene that we definitely got into<br />trouble with the censors in Britain.
5769931 5773265 It was funny 'cause they basically found
5773351 5775888 that they thought<br />the beating was too brutal,
5775979 5779438 that it went on too long,<br />and that's the point of the scene.
5779524 5784860 The point is that<br />when the narrator's position with Tyler
5784946 5787404 is challenged by somebody else,
5787532 5791196 out of jealousy, he beats this guy.<br />He beats this guy's face off.
5791286 5794153 I thought it should be a...
5794247 5797330 It made audiences very<br />uncomfortable, but it's supposed to.
5797417 5802958 It's supposed to be that scene where you<br />realize Fight Club isn't the answer.
5803047 5808133 Fight Club is... It's gone too far<br />and it's now become an excuse
5808219 5813635 for him to vent his frustration and rage<br />about all kinds of other things
5813725 5819186 on somebody who's not in on the joke.<br />You know, here's a guy, you know...
5819272 5824483 Jared does this great job at the beginning<br />of playing this kind of youthful, exuberant,
5824569 5828528 like, "Let's go. Fight Club.<br />I've heard a lot about it. It sounds great."
5828614 5831356 And Edward just demolishes him.
5831451 5833658 So it was funny, you know.
5833745 5837534 The censors came back and said,<br />"It made us uncomfortable."
5837623 5839079 "We thought the fighting<br />went on too long."
5839167 5842250 We were, like, "I guess we did our jobs."
5842378 5845211 They made us take two shots out<br />or something.
5845298 5848290 Initially there was<br />a lot more pummeling in it
5848426 5852044 and we showed it to people<br />and they weren't that disturbed.
5852138 5856553 Then I felt like we didn't<br />have enough of the impact
5856642 5860055 on the other people around them<br />so we shot some inserts of guys going...
5860146 5863980 You know, where you see he's cheering<br />and then he turns his head away,
5864108 5867851 and you have the crowd<br />becoming appalled.
5868321 5871859 So you had this moment<br />where people are cheering, then appalled,
5871949 5875487 then people stop,<br />and then they all move to him.
5875620 5877861 When we put in<br />the reactions of the crowd,
5877955 5882119 all of a sudden people got<br />way more disturbed than they had before.
5882210 5886704 It was almost like, by giving them the<br />subtle signposts that said this is wrong,
5886798 5890507 it got their sort of moral ire up.
5890635 5895345 But it was, you know, one of those scenes<br />that I think is a powerful scene
5895431 5898048 and it isn't supposed to be<br />likable, you know.
5898142 5901055 It's not one of those<br />where you're supposed to...
5901145 5905514 It's not to reaffirm for you<br />how much you're supposed to like Edward.
5905650 5910736 It's supposed to reaffirm... You've always<br />thought Fight Club was a bit questionable,
5910822 5916033 and this is Fight Club<br />and the rules of Fight Club being abused.
5916119 5921535 And the face of a young man<br />being abused by Edward in his jealousies.
5922542 5927036 Yeah, it was amazing to see, you know,<br />if you just showed carnage and mayhem,
5927130 5931419 people weren't as disturbed as when<br />you put in everybody else being appalled.
5931509 5936049 Nothing really changed much, except we<br />added a couple of faces of people in shock
5936139 5940349 and then, all of a sudden,<br />the audience was up in arms.
5970423 5973916 The scene in the car was tricky.<br />We ended up shooting it on a stage
5974051 5978170 because it just had too much coverage<br />and too much dialogue.
5978264 5983430 And I remember doing so many<br />driving shots in the rain for Se7en,
5983561 5987850 we could never get the lighting to match<br />from one side of the car to the other,
5987940 5990807 and it was just such a fucking nightmare.
5990902 5993610 So I said, "We're gonna do it<br />with rear projection,
5993696 5998031 and we'll have it rain so we don't get<br />a clear look at the rear projection."
5998117 6002327 It ended up working really well,<br />but it was night after night after night
6002413 6006281 of driving around with a SpaceCam<br />hanging off the back of an insert car,
6006375 6010619 shooting VistaVision plates<br />of lights going by, oil refineries going by,
6010755 6012587 left to right, left to right.
6012673 6015882 But it made it so much easier<br />to shoot on the stage
6015968 6019506 because, after a take,<br />everybody could get out, walk around.
6019597 6022214 It wasn't like you had to<br />rerig the whole car
6022308 6025471 and drive five miles<br />and go back to the start.
6025561 6028770 You could just, like,<br />rewind the film, start over again.
6028856 6030346 The crash is something...
6030441 6033729 There's a lot of stuff shot on stage<br />and a lot shot on location.
6033819 6036060 I think it matches, really, pretty well.
6036155 6041491 I thought Jeff Cronenweth did an<br />amazing job integrating a lot of stuff.
6041619 6047331 And I love the line<br />that Chuck had in this, which was:
6047458 6050496 "We've just had a near-life experience."
6053297 6057040 We consciously made a decision<br />when the valet pulls up,
6057134 6061173 the valet is not looking at Brad,<br />his eye line is looking to Edward.
6061264 6065223 <i>Then Edward, of course, demure. to Brad<br />and says, âAfter you, Mr. Burden.â</i>
6065309 6068768 He says, "After you",<br />and then Brad gets in on the driver's side,
6068854 6072597 and you have this whole sequence<br />with Edward in the passenger seat.
6072692 6075024 Then, when the car flips over and it lands,
6075152 6078941 you see Brad get out on<br />the passenger side of the car
6079031 6080772 'cause the car's now flipped over.
6080866 6084860 So he gets out and comes around<br />and pulls Edward out of the driver's side.
6084996 6086486 I remember when we were
6086831 6090415 doing the printmaster up at Skywalker,
6090501 6094711 a guy from Dolby was watching the movie<br />and he goes, "Oh, that's too bad."
6094797 6099416 We were, like, "What?" He said, "There's<br />a continuity problem." I said, "What?"
6099510 6103174 He said, "Well, Brad gets out of<br />the wrong side of the car."
6103264 6106473 And I said, "Just wait<br />a couple more reels."
6106559 6109176 "Tell me what you think then."
6112189 6117025 Most of the conversations he has, he's by<br />himself. When he's around other people...
6117111 6121571 I mean, they're always separated in<br />Fight Club and nobody's really clocking.
6121699 6124532 It's like when Brad<br />comes walking around the fight
6124619 6128487 where we see the seminarian<br />and the car salesman fight.
6128581 6132119 They're always by themselves<br />so that's not really an issue.
6132209 6135122 I think, definitely, conversations that I...
6135212 6139001 I mean, aside from the conversation<br />in the bar at the beginning,
6139091 6143005 which is a guy mumbling to himself<br />over in the corner having a few beers,
6143095 6146588 and the car crash,
6146724 6150388 which is dealt with, where the people<br />overhear what's happening
6150478 6154688 and they're sort of clocking each other<br />like, "This guy's 3 Icon."
6154774 6159894 And I don't know whether they're hearing<br />both sides of it, but they could be.
6159987 6162274 I think it checks out.
6162365 6168202 I always wanted to have some kind of<br />reminder back to the human sacrifices,
6168287 6170369 so we did this thing with the door.
6170456 6175075 On the door, there's a little Dymo label<br />that says, "Human sacrifices",
6175211 6178124 and there's all these drivers'<br />licences up there,
6178214 6184051 like they've really been industrious<br />in the past couple of months.
6224885 6229300 I love the makeup. I love what<br />Rob Bottin did. He really got this stylized...
6229432 6233596 Any time you build up the outside of<br />somebody's skin instead of taking away,
6233686 6237600 which you can't do<br />to an actor who works a lot,
6237690 6239397 you can't be carving away people's skin.
6239483 6245024 But he managed to find<br />this very interesting kind of mid-ground
6245156 6248444 between seeing the destruction<br />on people's faces
6248534 6250866 and still being able to recognize them.
6250995 6256991 It's difficult because everybody can end up<br />looking like The <i>Island</i> of Dr Moreau.
6257084 6259166 Soon you start building up the lumps.
6259253 6263167 Really, in going through research<br />on what happens to the human face,
6263257 6267797 the cadaver shots of people who've been<br />beaten to death with tire irons and stuff,
6267887 6271005 the swelling is kind of amazing,<br />how it distends.
6271140 6274599 You really can't...<br />It's very difficult to recognize people.
6274685 6281227 So we always had to walk that line,<br />and Bottin is a genius at that.
6282610 6287150 There was a problem in trying to find<br />somebody to play Marla. You never want...
6287239 6289230 I don't want people to feel sorry for her.
6289325 6292158 I want them to see somebody<br />who's made choices,
6292244 6295077 but is perfectly happy<br />with the choices she's made,
6295206 6299040 you know, however questionable<br />the behavior may be.
6299126 6301618 We're looking at her, saying,
6301712 6304750 "Okay, well, she's okay with it<br />so we should be okay with it."
6304840 6307252 And she does that, you know.
6307718 6310130 She's a very specific actress.
6310221 6313885 Exquisitely so, you know.<br />Really, like, "What is it about?"
6313974 6318764 "What am I playing?"<br />And she plays it so flawlessly.
6327738 6332608 This is an important scene<br />because it's really the killing of the clown.
6332743 6337237 I was watching Cirque du Soleil,<br />and I've seen all of their shows.
6337331 6339413 I was always amazed at the showmanship
6339542 6345834 'cause they always had these great kind of<br />fundamental, dramatic understandings.
6345923 6349211 They bring the clown<br />and you laugh and you laugh,
6349301 6353590 and the third time, the clown has<br />some kind of problem and he can't solve it.
6353722 6360059 Then there's this sad moment. Something<br />happens to the clown, and the audience...
6360145 6365436 It's incredibly moving<br />and I always wondered, "Why does...?"
6365526 6370362 If we're gonna kill somebody off,<br />or kill off Bob, it's gotta mean something.
6370447 6374441 He gets shot when they try<br />to destroy the corporate art.
6374577 6378161 But... it was one of those things<br />where it's like, you know...
6378247 6381706 On the set, when, you know,<br />Edward pulled off the mask
6381792 6386127 and everybody saw this incredible likeness<br />of Meat just lying on the table,
6386255 6393002 it was like you, for a second, understood<br />how poignant this moment could be.
6393137 6395504 It was always a scene I was worried about,
6395639 6399678 but then, when the mask came off,<br />it was, like, "Yikes."
6399810 6402097 "This is truly horrible."
6403314 6409276 And I love the Alexander Haig quality<br />of Jared in this scene
6409361 6412069 where he sort of takes over.
6412156 6414272 The Billy Idol.
6414366 6417358 He's his second in command.
6417453 6420161 I love how, you know,<br />'cause Tyler's not there,
6420247 6422659 they really put Edward on the hot seat.
6422750 6426618 They really make him work<br />to assert his authority.
6426712 6431377 And Edward sort of added this line, 'cause<br />originally he was, like, saying, "What?"
6431508 6436218 He started off incredulous,<br />and he added this thing, "You morons."
6436347 6438588 And he did it in this...
6438682 6442721 It always made me laugh when we were<br />watching it 'cause they were morons,
6442853 6447063 but he was the person<br />that just called a spade a spade.
6447191 6450479 It's like, "Morons. What are you doing<br />running around in ski masks,
6450569 6453652 "blowing things up?"<br />What do you think?"
6501245 6505705 The scene coming up, we had to<br />really kind of see this huge montage
6505791 6509955 where Edward travels the country<br />looking for Brad.
6510045 6512412 And, as usual, you know,<br />you end up having
6512506 6515123 one day at LAX to shoot all this stuff.
6515217 6519962 Conrad Hall Jr. came in and shot a lot of<br />the plane stuff and did an amazing job
6520055 6522672 just, you know, collecting material.
6522766 6526885 I mean, in one day,<br />he got these planes going back and forth.
6526979 6530347 We didn't want to end up<br />doing <i>When Hany</i> Met <i>Sally,</i>
6530441 6533934 the little animated plane<br />going back and forth,
6534028 6540115 but it had to be photorealistic, but,<br />basically, give you the same information.
6540200 6544740 It's not a scene I was ever happy with,<br />my part of it. The other stuff is great,
6544830 6549324 but I always felt<br />I kind of didn't have a handle on it.
6588707 6591074 I started to wonder<br />if we'd made a mistake.
6591168 6595002 Everywhere he goes, he finds people<br />who are not particularly bright
6595089 6600255 or not particularly listening to what<br />he's asking. I always liked that idea
6600344 6603678 that everybody who's part of<br />the whole kind of conspiracy is just...
6603764 6606426 They're not the brightest bulbs<br />on the tree.
6606517 6609726 But I started wondering,<br />when we got into testing,
6609853 6612220 whether or not we'd overplayed our hand
6612356 6617647 because, you know, you end up going,<br />"None of these idiots know anything."
6617736 6620103 "How is he ever gonna find this guy?"
6620197 6624816 But I love the connection being,<br />you know, these guys saying the chant:
6624910 6627527 "His name is Robert Paulsen."
6631041 6634250 <i>His name is Robert Paulsen...</i>
6635003 6637665 This is something<br />that Bottin and I talked about.
6638382 6640794 When he finally meets the bartender,
6640884 6645003 we wanted the bartender<br />to be pretty fucked up.
6645097 6647464 And I always love...
6647558 6649765 I always love those haloes. I love the...
6649893 6654683 I mean, not love, but, you know,<br />there's something so extreme about them,
6654773 6658607 and the idea of a guy going,<br />"Remember? You scarred me on the hand."
6658694 6662653 But the scar on his hand has to be,<br />like, the least of his worries.
6662739 6666698 It also does a funny thing. When he sits up<br />straight, you hear a squeak.
6666785 6671245 Ren Klyce put this little<br />as he straightens himself.
6671331 6674744 You don't know whether<br />he's been in a plane crash
6674835 6677543 or gone through a meat grinder or what,
6677629 6682089 and he's talking about<br />this little scar on his hand.
6692895 6694806 The scene where<br />Marla answers the phone,
6694897 6698390 we had shot where<br />she pops up into frame,
6698483 6702192 then she did one where<br />she couldn't get the phone off the cradle.
6702279 6704987 She was kicking it around.<br />We ended up using that,
6705115 6708824 'cause I loved the idea that there's<br />this tense moment that he's saying:
6708952 6713571 "Quick. Pick up. I gotta ask you this<br />question." She's like kick, kick, klumpf.
6713665 6716453 There's all this ruckus<br />underneath the frame
6716543 6718625 and then she finds<br />the phone and stands up.
6718712 6722080 You're not really quite<br />sure who he's calling.
6742819 6747234 We talked a long time about what<br />Tyler should be like when he reappears.
6747324 6753240 We talked about him looking like<br />this buffed out, shaved-headed monster,
6753330 6756789 this kind of World Wrestling Federation...
6756875 6759242 And then we kind of hit on this.
6759336 6762044 Michael Kaplan<br />brought this coat in that was...
6762130 6765088 It looked like something<br />from an INXS video,
6765175 6768634 and we got the idea<br />of Tyler as rock star, you know,
6768720 6772054 that Tyler comes back<br />with glacier glasses and the fur coat,
6772140 6778182 and this is his new incarnation.
6778313 6781146 And I loved that idea.
6781233 6784100 I found it so amusing<br />that he comes back as,
6784194 6786856 you know, Michael Hutchence<br />or something.
6803755 6805621 We rehearsed this scene a lot.
6805716 6808629 There are a lot of different ways<br />you could go with this,
6808719 6813213 where Tyler spells it out for him,<br />"Listen, dummy. Here's what the deal is."
6813348 6819264 But Brad hit on this great<br />even keel of, like, "Okay."
6819396 6822855 Being patient because<br />he still looks down his nose at him.
6822941 6827230 "Okay, let me explain this to you."<br />And I love the simplicity of that.
6827321 6831656 Edward came up with this idea.<br />We were wrapping that day of shooting
6831742 6835861 and Edward came up to me and he said,<br />"What if you shot a version of the shot,
6835954 6840699 the profile of Brad and me, and I was<br />leaning forward, but Brad wasn't there,
6840792 6842954 so you really saw how crazy I was?"
6843045 6847130 So we set the lights back up<br />and went in and shot this version
6847215 6851709 of Edward just leaning on the bed,<br />talking to no one.
6873784 6878654 Jim Haygood, who cut the movie, came up<br />with this little flutter-cutting thing
6878747 6881034 as the key for the flashbacks
6881124 6883240 so that you understood you were<br />looking at a flashback
6883335 6888705 from some alternate point of view because<br />of this little, like, jerking...
6888799 6891131 He took frames out of this and out of that
6891218 6894256 so it had this kind of<br />little spastic quality to it.
6894346 6897839 I loved that. It just had such a creepiness.
6898308 6904896 You know, there is nothing<br />kind of beautiful or smooth about reality.
6904981 6909475 Reality was this sort of jarring<br />kind of feel to it.
6914491 6917654 The ubiquitous Pepsi machine.<br />We got these...
6917744 6919906 We had this product tie-in with Pepsi
6919996 6924365 and we decided to make Pepsi<br />part of the whole consumer society,
6924501 6929496 so everywhere we go,<br />there's a Pepsi machine in the background.
6932008 6935592 And the numbers, when they<br />point at the numbers on the bill,
6935679 6938592 he's been calling CAA all night long.
6938682 6941265 He figured they wouldn't sue us.
6941351 6946016 And if they did,<br />they'd have to sue themselves for 10%.
6960787 6963654 In the background,<br />on the steps out to the backyard,
6963748 6967036 there's a home-made shooting gallery<br />with concrete stairs
6967127 6971041 and then these little clip-on targets<br />that are all shot up.
6971131 6974465 And, because the stairs<br />are concrete behind it,
6974551 6977589 there's also these boxes of Band-Aids,
6977721 6981589 like the full-metal-jacket shells<br />were ricocheting off this thing
6981725 6985389 and there's all these Band-Aids<br />on the steps right next to it,
6985479 6989017 like these guys are constantly being hit<br />by fragments of bullets
6989107 6995399 and they just Band-Aid themselves<br />and continue their shooting practice.
7020847 7024590 Ed Kowalczyk from Live,<br />he's the lead singer of Live,
7024684 7027972 he came in on a casting session
7028063 7031806 and said he had read the book<br />and wanted to be in the movie.
7031942 7035401 And so... I'm a huge fan<br />and I was incredibly flattered.
7035487 7039606 I said, "We don't have..." 'Cause he was<br />on tour and he only had a couple of days.
7039699 7042316 So, as it turned out,<br />the couple of days that
7042410 7044697 he had were when we were<br />shooting this scene
7044788 7048531 so we asked him if he wanted to be<br />the waiter and he said, "Sure."
7048625 7052414 So he came in and we shot with him.
7052504 7055713 Of course, you only see him<br />for that one shot,
7055799 7059417 and it cuts his face in half<br />when he leans over to talk to Edward.
7059511 7063926 Then we ended up reshooting the scene<br />so he ended up having to come back in.
7064015 7069510 He was an incredibly good sport about it,<br />but I was, like, "I'm sure he will hate me."
7069646 7072183 It was one those things.<br />"Oh, it will be a lark."
7072274 7074481 Then it ends up being a six-month curse
7074568 7079062 and you have to come back in<br />to do some little cameo.
7104472 7107635 Initially, it was written a little coy.
7107726 7112812 He kind of comes back and he whines<br />and tries to ingratiate himself to her,
7112897 7117437 and I just thought he just had to be<br />right on this, like, "You don't understand."
7117527 7122397 "This is what's going on." It had to have<br />a little bit more of a drive to it.
7122490 7126154 And I think Edward agreed with me,<br />and we got Fox to give us the money
7126244 7128406 and we went back and reshot it.
7128538 7131951 We put in things that we ended up pulling<br />because of the length,
7132042 7137663 but it was much better in the reshoot.<br />It just had more of a kind of intensity.
7137756 7140373 But I do think it's the kind of thing, like...
7140467 7146008 It probably shouldn't have been<br />them stopping and talking.
7146097 7151558 But I love what he does. I love that they're<br />coming from completely different places.
7151645 7154228 He knows he's been a schmuck.
7154314 7157056 He fucked up and there's no reason<br />she should believe him,
7157150 7162486 and yet he is hellbent on<br />getting what he wants out of it.
7162572 7165610 And she just thinks<br />he is a fucking lunatic by now
7165700 7168943 and is wondering why<br />she ever let him into her life.
7169037 7172905 And I thought that she played that so well.
7177754 7179870 I wanted this at<br />the beginning of the scene.
7179964 7182547 When they're having their argument,
7182634 7185922 <i>you see Seven Years in Tibet<br />on one 0? the marquees.</i>
7186012 7189596 There were three marquees<br />in the wide shot.
7189683 7191640 You never see them<br />'cause the bus is in the way,
7191726 7195390 but, in the background,<br />there's a marquee for <i>Wings</i> of the Dove,
7195480 7197767 <i>and The People vs. Larry Flynt.</i>
7197899 7202985 We had them all look like real marquees<br />where they don't have all the letters.
7203113 7208859 <i>So it was People vs. Larry Flyn,<br />Seven Year in Tibe, and Wing of Dove.</i>
7208952 7212240 So it has that sort of broken English,<br />video-cassette,
7212330 7217416 VCR-instruction-manual<br />kind of broken English vibe to it.
7232350 7235058 You can kind of see it just...<br />No, you can't.
7236855 7239813 You never see it,<br />but it's in the far back.
7259210 7262043 We had to shoot<br />the interrogation scene in one day,
7262130 7264622 move into a location and shoot it.
7264716 7271509 So we didn't quite end up doing it<br />the justice that I always wanted to do it,
7271598 7274681 but it turned out pretty good.
7276895 7280809 I love the cops.<br />They really look like cops to me.
7311221 7313758 There was an idea for a scene in the script
7313890 7320890 where, as Edward goes running<br />to the 1888 building to find the bombs,
7321064 7324978 as he's running along,<br />Brad ends up running beside him saying:
7325068 7331280 "Hey, where are you going?", so it's got<br />a real kind of Looney Tunes feel to it.
7331407 7334525 But we ended up cutting that out<br />and just going with the...
7334619 7338362 We just didn't have time<br />to shoot it and stage it.
7338456 7343246 You know, it would've required<br />insert cars with cameras on them.
7343336 7349673 So we ended just having him run<br />and have Brad appear outside the building
7349759 7351796 as he's trying to break in.
7372949 7378069 It was tough to get the audience to sort of<br />buy that all these people were in on it.
7378162 7381575 It's one of those things.<br />We wanted to get as quickly from this,
7381666 7385500 from the castration scene,<br />to the bomb as we possibly could.
7385628 7390748 But I love the idea of Edward Norton<br />as a thinking man's action hero,
7390842 7392708 this guy in underwear,
7392802 7397137 running around with a folder<br />in the middle of the night, and a .45.
7427629 7430496 There's an absurdist level to this movie
7430632 7434876 that was very difficult<br />to get audiences to kind of accept.
7435011 7437594 We've spent the last 20 years<br />in movies trying to...
7437680 7440547 Because we came upon<br />special-effects technology
7440683 7444972 that would allow us<br />to make anything look real,
7445063 7448476 so, when you do stuff that's metaphoric,
7448566 7452059 or you do stuff that's absurdist-based,<br />it's very...
7452195 7455859 Especially if it's photographed<br />in a realistic manner,
7455949 7458611 it's hard to get people<br />to understand the tone.
7458701 7461443 That was always a problem<br />with this material,
7461537 7468000 but, you know, I always felt that it was<br />more important to try and tell this tale
7468086 7471750 than it was to accept<br />defeat initially and go:
7471839 7478586 "We'll never get people to understand<br />the whole Dr Strangelove of it all."
7500159 7502321 Edward was a great sport about this.
7502412 7506155 I mean, there was never a moment<br />where you'd say to him:
7506249 7510117 "Okay, you're gonna be thrown down<br />the steps in your underwear."
7510211 7512919 You know, he was just, like,<br />"Okay. And then what?"
7513006 7515464 "He's gonna drag you by your hair."<br />"Okay-ll
7515591 7518333 "Then you crawl under the car<br />and he drags you out
7518428 7520294 and takes your shoe and beats you."
7520388 7522254 He's, like, "Okay, fine."
7522390 7525428 We ended up having<br />sort of a study in sadomasochism
7525518 7529557 because we would dream up things for him<br />and he would go along with it.
7529647 7535108 "All right. I have to crawl through<br />broken glass on my knees. All right. Fine."
7548249 7552208 We wanted to pay homage<br />to the World Trade Center bombing
7552295 7555504 by having this be a Budget rent-a-truck,
7555965 7561131 but Budget wouldn't give us their little<br />stickers to put on the keys and stuff.
7561220 7564133 They thought it was in bad taste.
7592043 7593750 After we'd assembled this scene,
7593836 7598626 we tried to time it out to<br />make it as explicit as possible.
7598716 7602084 You know, they had<br />a very measured kind of dialogue
7602178 7608049 so that we could have the timer really be<br />ticking down and have it in continuity.
7608184 7613270 But when we went to shoot the inserts, we<br />didn't have Edward, didn't have his hands.
7613356 7616394 So we ended up shooting<br />a lot of stuff out of continuity
7616526 7620269 to get the hands where we wanted them,<br />and then we matted the clock in
7620363 7624277 so that if you actually ran a clock<br />on the videotape of this,
7624367 7629988 you would find out that the clock<br />is exactly right where it's supposed to be.
7630081 7633824 So we just split-screened<br />the LEDs back in.
7644637 7650007 Definitely, the car being stolen at<br />the beginning is a complete flight of fancy.
7650101 7652217 There's no way that that can happen.
7652311 7657056 But, basically,<br />everything else is pretty bulletproof.
7657150 7661610 But it is a different movie<br />the second time you see it, you know.
7665992 7667232 <i>Okay.</i>
7667326 7670364 <i>You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend.</i>
7670454 7676325 I love the idea of your alternate<br />personality, this creation of yours,
7676419 7679002 that gets fed up with you<br />at a certain point.
7679088 7682376 He's just sick to death of you<br />and your weakness.
7682466 7685754 And he has to take over, he has to, like...
7685887 7688254 And, originally, this fight scene
7688347 7691806 that took place in the building<br />was very Dr <i>Strangelove.</i>
7691934 7694517 It was very much like this alien presence.
7694604 7698973 They were gonna have a whole shoot-out,<br />rushing around, firing at each other.
7699108 7701816 We were gonna try to do this whole<br />Die <i>Hard</i> thing
7701944 7704185 where he's trying to find Tyler
7704280 7707068 and Tyler can appear<br />at any moment and beat him up.
7707158 7711652 But it ended up being very funny-funny,<br />you know, kind of goofy-funny,
7711787 7716623 so we finally kind of, you know, about<br />two weeks before we had to shoot this,
7716751 7719368 we sat down and said,<br />"This should be brutal."
7719462 7722329 "He should beat the living shit<br />out of this guy."
7722465 7725207 So, when we walked in,<br />we had the whole thing staged
7725301 7728134 and the stunt guys were<br />there, and they were,
7728221 7730007 like, "Okay, then what<br />do you want us to do?"
7730139 7734053 "You throw him through this window."<br />They were, like, "He's in shorts?"
7734143 7737056 I said, "Yeah."<br />"Then he comes here and he does what?"
7737146 7740855 "You drag him from under the car,<br />then you get into this fight here,
7740983 7743395 then he throws him<br />down the side of the car
7743486 7746069 "and he breaks the little side-view mirror."
7746155 7749398 And he said, "With what?"<br />I said, "With his face. What else?"
7749492 7752655 And they were going,<br />"Oh, my God. And then what happens?"
7752745 7755828 "Then he drags him<br />and throws him down the stairs."
7755957 7759916 And the guy who actually did this stunt<br />was truly amazing.
7760002 7762744 I mean, we probably did 11 takes of it.
7762838 7766923 We threw him down three flights of stairs<br />with no pads on
7767009 7770843 and he did it amazingly.
7791200 7794443 We added this joke,<br />where Tyler says, "What? I'm sorry?"
7794537 7797199 And he says,<br />"I still can't think of anything."
7797290 7799782 And then Tyler says,<br />"Oh, flashback humor."
7799875 7803789 We added that one<br />for people who were paying attention.
7807591 7809923 But, again, the thing, you know...
7810052 7815923 I love the negotiation with the insane,
7816058 7820017 you know, hyperstylized,<br />masculine side of yourself.
7820104 7824769 I love the idea of him trying to...<br />He's trying to reason with him now.
7824859 7829194 His ankle's fucked up, he's been thrown<br />down the stairs, his face is cut up,
7829280 7831988 and he's still trying to kind of get through.
7832074 7836238 He's trying to get through to him,<br />but he's obviously not powerful enough.
7836329 7839867 He's not physically powerful enough<br />to overcome Tyler.
7839957 7846249 But his mind is still working. He's still<br />trying. He's looking for some way out.
7854513 7857505 And we had this idea<br />as we were rehearsing this,
7857600 7861559 that Tyler should address this idea that...
7862772 7864888 <i>-Why can't I get rid of you?<br />-You need me.</i>
7864982 7867064 <i>No. I don't. I really don't any more.</i>
7867151 7871019 You know, "Look at all this I've done<br />for you, you ungrateful fuck."
7871113 7875528 And also that he calls him on it,<br />says, "Take some responsibility for it."
7875618 7881455 And I always loved that, the notion<br />of this very intellectual argument
7881540 7883201 coming down to...
7883292 7889413 You know, some of the more salient points<br />are brought up by the truly insane person.
7889507 7893751 The truly insane character in the room<br />is the one who goes, "Hey."
7893844 7898930 "I didn't dream you up.<br />You dreamt me up. This is your mess."
7928421 7933461 When we... when we started<br />cutting the trailers for the movie,
7933551 7937636 there was, you know,<br />a couple of scenes of Brad in this...
7937721 7941214 He's wearing this tank top.<br />I think it says "Black Sugar" on it.
7941350 7943762 And it's basically,
7943853 7948472 like, a photo collage of pornography.
7948566 7952651 It's just, like, all these naked women,<br />you know, with their legs spread.
7952736 7956479 And it has stars over all the offending bits,
7956574 7959783 but it's still just<br />covered with pornography.
7959869 7961485 These shirts were made for the movie.
7961579 7964537 They found this fabric<br />and had these shirts made.
7964623 7968662 Brad loved them, and that was the shirt<br />Tyler was gonna wear at the end.
7968752 7972916 We'd finally finished cutting the trailer<br />and we'd gotten it past the MPAA,
7973048 7977042 who was loaded for bear. They were skeet<br />shooting this entire movie.
7977136 7981255 Everything we would send them, they<br />would go through it with a microscope.
7981390 7983427 We finally sent the final trailer,
7983559 7987848 and they approved it on the basis of<br />a three-quarter-inch dub of an Avid output.
7987938 7991897 But, I mean, when he goes, "Whoa, whoa,<br />whoa" at the end of the trailer,
7992026 7995360 he's standing there in this shirt<br />covered with pornography.
7995446 8001067 I remember finishing the trailer at the last<br />possible second that it could be finished
8001202 8005161 and sent to the theaters<br />in order to get it on Star <i>Wars,</i> I guess.
8005247 8007614 <i>It was for the big Star Wars.</i>
8010252 8013916 I was, like, "I never thought this shirt<br />would get past the MPAA."
8014006 8016293 And one of the guys<br />from Fox said, "What?"
8016425 8019383 I said, "That shirt's<br />covered with pornography."
8019470 8021962 And they were, like, "Oh!" Sweating it.
8022097 8025715 "Oh, my God. It's covered with<br />pornography. What are we gonna do?"
8025809 8027891 "We're gonna have to fuzz it out,
8027978 8030515 or do what they do on rap videos on MTV
8030606 8033223 where they put that<br />mosaic over everything."
8033317 8037811 It just got to be... The whole, you know,<br />censorship issue on a movie like this
8037947 8042111 just gets to be so hilarious.
8058968 8061926 We looped all of Edward's lines here,<br />at the end,
8062012 8064754 and he actually put rock<br />candy in his mouth
8064848 8069593 so he has things in the back of his teeth<br />and they're actually clattering around.
8069687 8071928 It's like the gun has gone off
8072022 8075390 and blown one of his<br />back-left molars out the side of his face.
8075484 8080945 But he's still, "I'm okay, I'm okay.<br />Everything is okay. Let her go."
8081031 8084149 I always thought, before we looped it,
8084243 8087031 people were just appalled<br />by this final scene.
8087162 8089494 When we finally looped it so he could...
8089623 8091739 He had a different voice<br />throughout this thing
8091834 8094121 'cause we shot it over two or three days,
8094211 8097169 and so in some of the close-ups<br />he's, like, "Ow, ow, ow",
8097256 8101625 and in others his voice was clear.<br />And so, when we finally put it all together
8101719 8106384 with this voice that was kind of fucked up,<br />people just started cracking up.
8106515 8110099 And that's what they should be doing.
8110185 8112643 That's my feeling about<br />what they should be doing.
8112730 8117600 I love the idea of her coming up there to<br />go, "You fucker. I don't ever want to see..."
8117693 8122028 "Oh, my God.<br />What is wrong with your face?"
8122781 8125614 I wanted to do an effect<br />where she goes into her purse
8125701 8128944 and pulls out some wad of tissue<br />that she's sneezed in,
8129038 8131746 and she tucks it in the hole in his cheek.
8131832 8134790 But we could never figure out<br />a way to do that.
8134877 8137244 He, at first, doesn't want her to do it,
8137338 8140330 "Oh, no, that's okay.<br />That's all right. I'm all right."
8148140 8150381 The buildings coming down at the end...
8153979 8157267 Doc Baily, the CG artist who created all<br />these buildings, he worked on The Game
8157399 8161484 when Michael Douglas<br />crashes through the ceiling
8161570 8163652 and all the little pieces of glass fall.
8163739 8166777 So we called him and said,<br />"Boy, have we got a job for you."
8166867 8169700 And we told him about<br />this final shot and he said,
8169787 8172324 "Well, how much time do you have?"
8172414 8175497 I said, "As far as<br />I'm concerned you can start,
8175584 8178542 because we have to get a translight made,
8178629 8182497 and we're not shooting it for six months."
8182591 8186801 "You can have a year. You can have<br />a year and two months if you want it."
8186887 8188844 He said, "Okay." He took this job
8188931 8192970 and all he did for one whole year<br />was work on the final shot,
8193102 8197721 making all these little falling bits of<br />building and breaking these buildings up.
8197815 8200398 It was amazing,<br />you know, 'cause you would go...
8200484 8203567 Every two or three weeks,<br />you would see what he was up to,
8203654 8208319 and he was on building number three, "I've<br />got the glass to blow in building three."
8208409 8212198 I was always wondering about,<br />if our cellphones were tapped,
8212287 8215245 what the CIA would be thinking.<br />"How's it coming?"
8215332 8218245 "Building three<br />is gonna go down really easily."
8218335 8222203 "That's not a problem. I'm worried<br />about the blasts on building four
8222297 8227087 because if the glass goes too far out, it<br />would be killing everybody in the street."
8227177 8230260 These conversations<br />would go on and on and on
8230347 8232463 about what destruction we should wreak.
8232558 8238270 All the building are based on photographs<br />of buildings that we took in and around LA,
8238355 8242474 so we were referring to a building<br />in Century City or a building downtown,
8242568 8246903 and, you know, we would call them<br />the Time Warner building or whatever.
8246989 8250778 The Fox Tower is one of the ones<br />that goes down in the foreground.
8250868 8253530 And, of course,<br />all of our conversations were:
8253620 8257488 "Okay, so if you blow up the Fox Tower<br />before you blow up the other one..."
8257583 8260541 But he did an amazing, amazing job.
8260669 8262876 It was literally a frame at a time.
8263005 8265542 And in the end, you know, he was saying:
8265674 8271420 "We're probably gonna have, like,<br />8-900,000 separate bits of falling stuff."
8271513 8273345 In the end it was millions.
8273432 8277175 It was three or four million<br />little separate pieces that were falling.
8277311 8282056 The glass that blows out of the towers in<br />the background and the smoke elements,
8282191 8286651 I mean, it was millions.<br />It took weeks and weeks and weeks
8286737 8290651 to laser-record all the stuff out.
8296997 8299614 There he is, Richard "Dr" Baily.
