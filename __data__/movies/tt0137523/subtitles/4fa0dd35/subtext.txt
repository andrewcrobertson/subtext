125209 128334 <i>People are always asking me<br />if I know Tyler Durden.</i>
128380 129880 Three minutes.
129970 132420 This is it. Ground zero.
133050 135090 Would you like to say a few<br />words to mark the occasion?
136550 139680 <i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,<br />you speak only in vowels.</i>
139770 141430 I can't think of anything.
141520 145690 <i>For a second, I totally forget about<br />Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing</i>
145770 147900 <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>
147980 149940 It's getting exciting now.
150030 153150 <i>That old saying,<br />how you always hurt the one you love,</i>
153240 155240 <i>well, it works both ways.</i>
155950 159830 <i>We have front-row seats<br />for this theatre of mass destruction.</i>
159910 162160 <i>The Demolitions Committee<br />of Project Mayhem</i>
162250 166830 <i>wrapped the foundation columns<br />of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>
166920 169550 <i>In two minutes,<br />primary charges will blow base charges</i>
169630 173090 <i>and a few square blocks will be reduced<br />to smouldering rubble.</i>
173590 176220 <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>
176720 180220 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
180310 185850 <i>And suddenly, I realize that all of this:<br />the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>
185940 189400 <i>has got something to do<br />with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>
191230 193610 <i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>
194740 198370 <i>This was a support group<br />for men with testicular cancer.</i>
198450 201790 <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,<br />that was Bob.</i>
202250 203830 We're still men.
204290 205830 Yes, we're men.
206330 208130 Men is what we are.
208201 212960 <i>Eight months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.<br />Then hormone therapy.</i>
213010 215880 <i>He developed bitch tits<br />because his testosterone was too high</i>
215970 218050 <i>and his body upped the estrogen</i>
218140 219562 <i>and that was where I fit.</i>
219564 222431 I think they're gonna have to open up<br />my pecs again and drain the fluid.
222520 224390 <i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>
224480 227900 <i>that hung enormous,<br />the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>
227980 230150 Okay , you cry now.
231480 234230 <i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>
235030 237490 <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>
237610 239780 <i>I couldn't sleep...</i>
240410 242660 <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>
243620 245500 <i>Everything's far away.</i>
245660 247920 <i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>
248000 249420 <i>of a copy.</i>
252920 254920 <i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>
255010 258010 <i>it'll be the corporations<br />that name everything.</i>
258220 260140 <i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>
260680 262510 <i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>
262970 264890 <i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>
265390 268270 I need you out of town a little more this week.<br />We've got some red flags to cover.
268350 271940 <i>It must have been Tuesday.<br />He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.</i>
272020 276650 You want me to deprioritise my current reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
276740 278200 Make these your primary action items.
278750 281280 Here's your flight coupons.<br />Call me from the road if there's any snags.
281370 285120 <i>He was full of pep.<br />Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>
287460 292250 <i>Like so many others, I had become<br />a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>
292880 297130 - Uh, yes. I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.<br /><i>- Please hold.</i>
297220 299970 <i>If I saw something clever,<br />like a little coffee table</i>
300050 303050 <i>in the shape of a yin-yang,<br />I had to have it.</i>
304180 306520 <i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>
306600 309180 <i>The Hovetrekke home Exerbike.</i>
309270 312980 <i>Or the Ohamshab sofa<br />with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>
313400 317900 <i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of<br />environmentally friendly unbleached paper.</i>
318400 320320 <i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder:</i>
320410 323620 <i>What kind of dining set<br />defines me as a person?</i>
324580 329290 <i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes<br />with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>
329370 331500 <i>proof that they were<br />crafted by the honest,</i>
331580 334170 <i>simple, hard-working,<br />indigenous peoples of...</i>
334250 335630 <i>- Please hold.<br />- ...wherever.</i>
335758 338273 - I was holding.<br /><i>- Your call is important to us.</i>
338340 340220 <i>We used to read pornography.</i>
340300 342220 <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>
342300 346600 - No. You can't die from insomnia.<br />- What about narcolepsy?
347140 351270 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.<br />I have no idea how I got there.
351350 355360 - You need to lighten up.<br />- Can you please just give me something?
355440 358480 <i>Red and blue Tuinals,<br />lipstick-red Seconals...</i>
359070 362360 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
363110 366410 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
369580 373580 - Hey, come on. I'm in pain.<br />- You wanna see pain?
373670 378460 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.<br />See the guys with testicular cancer.
379130 380670 That's pain.
396310 400070 I always wanted three kids.<br />Two boys and a girl.
400940 403400 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
403990 406410 We never could agree on anything.
407740 410990 Well, she had her first child last week.
411960 413160 A girl.
414750 417170 With her... with her new husband.
421460 423420 And thank God. You know?
424090 425840 I-I'm glad for her.
427300 430640 Because she deserves it.
434100 437520 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
437610 439270 Thank you, Thomas.
439770 443070 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
443360 445400 And that gives me strength.
445490 447610 We give each other strength.
447910 449450 It's time for the one-on-ones.
449530 454200 So let's all of us follow Thomas' good example<br />and really open ourselves up.
455040 457080 Could you find a partner?
459670 462250 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>
463720 466510 <i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>
469140 472310 <i>Knees together.<br />Those awkward little steps.</i>
477980 479940 - My name is Bob.<br />- Bob?
480820 483190 <i>Bob had been a champion body builder.</i>
483280 486650 <i>You know that chest expansion<br />program you see on late-night TV?</i>
486740 488110 <i>That was his idea.</i>
488200 489740 I was a juicer.
490530 492620 You know - using steroids.
494080 497620 Diabonal and... Wisterol.
498120 501670 Oh, they use that on racehorses,<br />for Christ's sakes.
502710 506420 And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
508510 513350 my two grown kids<br />won't even return my phone calls.
514770 518850 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty<br />make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>
521650 523520 Go ahead... Cornelius.
524570 526030 You can cry.
540960 544710 <i>And then... something happened.<br />I let go.</i>
544800 546550 That's really good.
546880 548590 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>
549050 551300 <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>
553720 555310 <i>I found freedom.</i>
556020 558310 <i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>
560350 561690 It's okay.
565070 567280 <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>
570490 572990 <i>I became addicted.</i>
586750 591340 <i>If I didn't say anything,<br />people always assumed the worst.</i>
595350 597640 <i>They cried harder...</i>
597720 598970 <i>then I cried harder.</i>
607690 611900 Now we're going to open the green door,<br />the heart chakra...
612160 614110 <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>
614490 617370 <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>
617990 621710 <i>I was the warm little centre<br />that the life of this world crowded around.</i>
622540 626540 Imagine your pain<br />as a white ball of healing light.
627210 630550 It moves all over your body, healing you.
631340 634130 Now keep this going.<br />Remember to breathe.
634430 637720 And step forward<br />through the back door of the room.
638720 640430 Where does it lead?
640890 642520 To your cave.
643190 646440 Step forward into your cave.
647400 648860 That's right.
649230 652530 <i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>
653070 657910 <i>and you're going to find<br />your power animal.</i>
660120 661500 Slide.
672340 674300 <i>Every evening I died.</i>
675470 678090 <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>
678760 680140 <i>Resurrected.</i>
682850 687020 <i>Bob loved me because he thought<br />my testicles were removed too.</i>
687100 691570 <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,<br />ready to cry.</i>
692150 694110 <i>This was my vacation.</i>
697950 701620 <i>And she... ruined everything.</i>
701700 703580 This is cancer, right?
706790 711130 <i>This chick, Marla Singer,<br />did not have testicular cancer.</i>
711710 713260 <i>She was a liar.</i>
713460 715800 <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>
716050 719930 <i>I had seen her at Free and Clear,<br />my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>
720010 723140 <i>Then at Hope,<br />my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>
724100 727850 <i>And again at Seize the Day,<br />my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>
731150 733980 <i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>
734650 736990 <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>
737150 739740 <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>
739820 744450 <i>I couldn't cry.<br />So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>
756840 759340 <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>
759680 762800 <i>after we open our heart chakras,<br />when it's time to hug,</i>
762890 765770 <i>I'm gonna grab that bitch Marla Singer<br />and scream:</i>
765850 770060 Marla, you liar!<br />You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!
771610 773730 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>
774690 775820 <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>
775900 779110 <i>When you have insomnia,<br />you're never really asleep</i>
779740 781990 <i>and you're never really awake.</i>
784290 788370 To begin tonight's communion,<br />Chloe would like to say a few words.
789500 791790 <i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>
793000 795300 <i>Chloe looked the way<br />Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>
795380 799380 <i>if you made it smile and walk around a<br />party being extra nice to everybody.</i>
800050 801840 Well, I'm still here.
802510 804720 But I don't know for how long.
805560 808600 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
809270 811390 But I've got some good news.
811980 814480 I no longer have any fear of death.
818320 822110 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
823200 825410 No one will have sex with me.
826620 827660 I'm so close to the end,
827750 830910 and all I want is to get laid for<br />the last time.
831750 834460 I have pornographic movies<br />in my apartment,
834540 837920 - and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />- Thank you, Chloe.
839010 841130 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
842590 844390 Thank you, Chloe.
846310 850020 Now, let's ready ourself<br />for guided meditation.
852270 855310 You're standing at the entrance<br />of your cave.
855820 859030 You step inside your cave and you walk...
859280 862570 <i>if I did have a tumour, I'd name it Marla.</i>
863780 864950 <i>Marla.</i>
865160 867160 <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>
867240 870700 <i>that would heal if you could stop<br />tonguing it, but you can't.</i>
870790 874170 ...deeper into your cave as you walk.
875630 878960 <i>You feel the healing energy of<br />this place all around you.</i>
881050 883130 <i>Now find your power animal.</i>
887600 888850 Slide.
892730 895230 Okay. Let's partner up.
895810 898360 Pick someone special to you tonight.
904490 905570 Hey.
906910 908830 - We need to talk.<br />- Sure.
914210 915920 - I'm onto you.<br />- What?
916000 919000 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
920171 920920 Sorry?
921010 925590 In the Tibetan-philosophy,<br />Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
925680 929180 All right, but you're not dying<br />the way Chloe back there is dying.
929510 930510 So?
931270 933020 So you're a tourist.
933480 937770 I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,<br />I saw you at tuberculosis.
937860 939900 I saw you at testicular cancer!
939980 942030 I saw you practising this.
942190 944320 - Practising what?<br />- Telling me off.
944400 947410 Is it going as well as you hoped...<br />"Rupert"?
948870 951700 - I'll expose you.<br />- Go ahead. I'll expose you.
951790 954700 All right, come together. Let yourselves cry.
962880 964630 Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
964720 967130 It's cheaper than a movie<br />and there's free coffee's.
967220 970930 Look, this is important.<br />These are my groups.
971010 973140 I've been coming for over a year.
973220 976230 - Why do you do it?<br />- I don't know.
976310 980150 When people think you're dying, then they<br />really really listen to you instead of just...
980230 983150 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
984400 986690 Yeah. Yeah.
987700 990280 Share yourself, completely.
991660 994330 Look, you don't want to get into this.<br />It becomes an addiction.
994410 996660 - Really?<br />- I'm not kidding.
996750 1000170 I can't cry if another faker is present,<br />and I need this.
1000250 1002840 So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
1002920 1006010 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1009010 1011916 Wait a second. Hold on. I'll tell you.
1011970 1015770 We're gonna split up the week, okay?<br />You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1015850 1018520 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1018600 1022020 Okay. Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1022110 1026150 Technically, I have more right to be there than you.<br />You still have your balls.
1026240 1028610 - You're kidding.<br />- I dunno. Am I?
1028950 1030150 No. No.
1030280 1033200 - What do you want?<br />- I'll take the parasites.
1033280 1036040 You can't have both the parasites, but<br />why don't you take the blood parasites.
1036120 1037700 I want brain parasites.
1037790 1040915 I'll take the blood parasites,<br />but I'm gonna take the organic brain dementia.
1040954 1043380 - I want that.<br />- You can't have the whole brain.
1043460 1046050 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1046130 1049630 Okay. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
1050220 1052260 Now we both have three...
1055930 1058470 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1074580 1078580 - What, are you selling those?<br />- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
1078660 1080750 So, we each have three. That's six.
1080830 1083250 What about the seventh day?<br />I want ascending bowel cancer.
1083330 1085420 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>
1085500 1090380 - No. No. I want bowel cancer.<br />- That's your favourite too?
1090880 1094510 - Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />- Look, we're gonna split it.
1094890 1097890 Take the first and third Sunday<br />of the month.
1100140 1101230 Deal.
1103980 1107610 - Looks like this is goodbye.<br />- Well, let's not make a big thing out of it, okay.
1107690 1110320 How's this for not making a big thing?
1114820 1116950 Hey, Marla! Marla!
1118950 1122370 - Maybe we should exchange numbers.<br />- Should we?
1122620 1124830 We might wanna switch nights.
1126040 1127090 Okay.
1132680 1135180 <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>
1136680 1140390 <i>Marla's philosophy of life<br />is that she might die at any moment.</i>
1140470 1143020 <i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>
1143100 1145480 It doesn't have your name! Who are you?
1145560 1148820 Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?
1148900 1151820 Any of the stupid names<br />you give each night?
1154700 1156700 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>
1157280 1159740 <i>SFO. LAX.</i>
1160830 1165250 <i>You wake up at O'Hare.<br />Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>
1165960 1170170 <i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.<br />Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>
1170250 1173300 Check-in for that flight<br />doesn't begin for another two hours, sir.
1173380 1177010 <i>This is your life,<br />and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>
1177800 1180850 <i>You wake up at Air Harbour International.</i>
1181720 1185390 <i>If you wake up at a different time,<br />in a different place,</i>
1185810 1188600 <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>
1189570 1192070 <i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>
1192820 1197450 <i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream,<br />single pat of butter.</i>
1198240 1200910 <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>
1200990 1206000 <i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample<br />package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>
1208250 1212250 <i>The people I meet on each flight,<br />they're single-serving friends.</i>
1213630 1218430 <i>Between take-off and landing, we have<br />our time together, but that's all we get.</i>
1219220 1220470 <i>Welcome!</i>
1222640 1223890 <i>On a long-enough time line,</i>
1223970 1227140 <i>the survival rate for<br />everyone drops to zero.</i>
1227230 1230940 <i>I was a recall coordinator.<br />My job was to apply the formula.</i>
1231020 1234110 The infant went through the windshield.<br />Three points.
1234190 1238280 <i>A new car built by my company<br />leaves somewhere travelling at 60mph.</i>
1238360 1240660 <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>
1240740 1243620 The teenager's braces<br />are wrapped around the back-seat ashtray.
1243700 1245910 Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
1246000 1248870 <i>The car crashes and burns<br />with everyone trapped inside.</i>
1248960 1251330 <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>
1251670 1253090 The father must've been huge.
1253170 1256880 See where the fat's burned to the seat?<br />The polyester shirt?
1256970 1258670 Very modern art.
1258970 1261720 <i>Take the number of<br />vehicles in the field, A.</i>
1261800 1264430 <i>Multiply it by the probable rate<br />of failure, B.</i>
1264520 1268270 <i>Then multiply the result by<br />the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>
1268350 1270690 <i>A x B x C...</i>
1270900 1272150 equals X.
1272230 1276820 If X is less than the cost of a recall,<br />we don't do one.
1278320 1280950 Are there a lot of these<br />kinds of accidents?
1281030 1282910 You wouldn't believe.
1284580 1287040 Which car company do you work for?
1288000 1289370 A major one.
1292040 1295500 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply<br />on take-off or landing,</i>
1295590 1299090 <i>I prayed for a crash<br />or a mid-air collision.</i>
1299170 1300470 <i>Anything.</i>
1310230 1314310 <i>Life insurance pays off triple<br />if you die on a business trip.</i>
1316650 1319570 "If you are seated<br />in an emergency exit row
1321030 1325780 "and feel you would be unable or unwilling to<br />perform the duties listed on the safety card,
1325870 1328870 "please ask a flight attendant<br />to reseat you."
1330160 1334380 - it's a lot of responsibility.<br />- Wanna switch seats?
1334460 1337920 No. I'm not sure<br />I'm the man for that particular job.
1338010 1342090 An exit-door procedure<br />at 30,000 feet.
1342760 1344640 The illusion of safety.
1345100 1346760 Yeah. I guess so.
1347640 1350470 You know why<br />they put oxygen masks on planes?
1350560 1354440 - So you can breathe.<br />- Oxygen gets you high.
1355480 1359110 In a catastrophic emergency,<br />you're taking giant panic breaths.
1359280 1363110 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.<br />You accept your fate.
1364620 1366570 It's all right here.
1367280 1369870 Emergency water landing, 600mph.
1369950 1373040 Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
1373620 1375290 That's...
1376170 1378710 That's an interesting theory.
1380920 1383470 - What do you do?<br />- What do you mean?
1383550 1384970 What do you do for a living?
1385050 1388010 Why? So you can pretend<br />like you're interested?
1391270 1392270 Okay.
1392350 1395560 You have a kind of<br />sick desperation in your laugh.
1398690 1401150 We have the exact same briefcase.
1402240 1403400 Soap.
1403490 1406700 - Sorry?<br />- I make and I sell soap.
1407410 1409700 The yardstick of civilization.
1410410 1412120 <i>And this is how I met...</i>
1412200 1413790 "Tyler Durden".
1414250 1416080 Did you know if you mixed equal parts of gasoline
1416170 1419590 and frozen orange juice concentrate,<br />you can make napalm?
1419670 1422340 - No, I did not know that. Is that true?<br />- That's right.
1422420 1426010 One can make all kinds of explosives<br />using simple household items.
1426090 1428640 - Really?<br />- If one were so inclined.
1433850 1438730 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting<br />single-serving friend I've ever met.
1440400 1444860 - See, everything on a plane is single-serving...<br />- Oh, I get it. Very clever.
1445240 1446570 Thank you.
1447450 1449450 How's that working out for you?
1449530 1451280 - What?<br />- Being clever.
1452830 1457040 - Great.<br />- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
1459040 1460080 Now, a question of etiquette.
1460170 1463250 As I pass,<br />do I give you the ass or the crotch?
1470680 1473010 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>
1473100 1476390 <i>Airlines have this policy<br />about vibrating luggage.</i>
1484740 1486240 Was it ticking?
1486320 1489610 Actually, throwers don't worry about<br />ticking because modern bombs don't tick.
1489700 1492330 - Sorry. Throwers?<br />- Baggage handlers.
1493580 1497660 But when a suitcase vibrates,<br />then the throwers got to call the police.
1497750 1500420 My suitcase was vibrating?
1500500 1505800 Nine times out of ten it's an electric<br />razor, but... every once in a while...
1508930 1510470 it's a dildo.
1511680 1515720 Of course it's company policy never to imply<br />ownership in the event of a dildo.
1515810 1521690 We have to use the indefinite article -<br />"a dildo", never "your dildo".
1521770 1523480 I don't own...
1526690 1533490 <i>I had everything in that suitcase.<br />My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>
1535200 1536740 <i>Never mind.</i>
1538830 1541460 Hey! That's my car!
1548510 1551380 <i>Home was a condo on<br />the 15th floor of a filing cabinet</i>
1551470 1553760 <i>for widows and young professionals.</i>
1553850 1555850 <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>
1555930 1559230 <i>A foot of concrete's important when your<br />next-door neighbour lets her hearing-aid go</i>
1559310 1562140 <i>and has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>
1562230 1566520 <i>Or when a volcanic blast of debris that<br />used to be your furniture and personal effects</i>
1566610 1570400 <i>blows out of your floor to ceiling windows<br />and sails flaming into the night.</i>
1576790 1579250 <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>
1592050 1594180 There's... nothing up there.
1594260 1597510 You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
1606310 1608820 Do you have somebody you can call?
1609570 1613990 <i>How embarrassing.<br />A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>
1624040 1626040 <i>The police would later tell me that the pilot light</i>
1626130 1630993 <i>might have gone out,<br />letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>
1631050 1633630 <i>That gas could have<br />slowly filled the condo,</i>
1633720 1636140 <i>1700 square feet with high ceilings,</i>
1636220 1638140 <i>for days and days.</i>
1645400 1649230 <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor<br />could have clicked on.</i>
1651110 1652280 <i>Yeah?</i>
1655240 1657620 <i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>
1667250 1670790 <i>if you ask me now,<br />I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>
1713420 1715170 - Hello?<br /><i>- Who's this?</i>
1717380 1719930 - Tyler?<br /><i>- Who is this?</i>
1720010 1721260 Um...
1721600 1723890 We met... We met on the airplane.
1723970 1725980 We had the same suitcase?
1726560 1730270 - Uh... the clever guy.<br /><i>- Oh, yeah. Right.</i>
1732570 1736440 I called a second ago.<br />There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
1736530 1739450 <i>Yeah, I *69'd you.<br />I never pick up my phone.</i>
1742160 1743990 <i>So what's up?</i>
1745040 1746330 Well...
1747160 1748830 You're not gonna believe this.
1751920 1753540 You know man, it could be worse.
1753630 1758130 A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep<br />and toss it out the window of a moving car.
1758590 1760470 There's always that.
1760840 1763680 It's just, when you buy furniture,<br />you tell yourself:
1763970 1766180 That's it. That's the last sofa I'm gonna need.
1766270 1770060 Whatever else happens,<br />I've got that sofa problem handled.
1770150 1773360 I had it all.<br />I had a stereo that was very decent.
1773570 1776110 A wardrobe that was<br />getting very respectable.
1776190 1778860 I was close to being complete.
1778950 1782030 - Shit, man. And now it's all gone.<br />- All gone.
1782910 1784370 All gone.
1786410 1788580 Do you know what a duvet is?
1789160 1792170 - It's a comforter.<br />- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
1792710 1795130 Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
1795210 1799380 Is this essential to our survival<br />in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word?
1799630 1800800 No.
1801430 1805600 - What are we, then?<br />- I dunno. Consumers.
1805890 1807890 Right. We're consumers.
1808100 1811060 We are by-products of<br />a lifestyle obsession.
1812020 1815480 Murder, crime, poverty.<br />These things don't concern me.
1815570 1818400 What concerns me<br />are celebrity magazines,
1818900 1821280 television with 500 channels,
1821360 1822990 some guy's name on my underwear.
1823070 1825660 Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
1825740 1828370 - Martha Stewart.<br />- Fuck Martha Stewart.
1828910 1832460 Martha's polishing the brass on the Titanic.<br />It's all going down, man.
1832540 1836750 So fuck off with your sofa units<br />and Strinne green stripe patterns.
1837000 1839300 I say never be complete.
1839380 1841470 I say stop being perfect.
1841760 1843760 I say let... let's evolve.
1844140 1846600 Let the chips fall where they may.
1848600 1852520 But that's me, and I could be wrong.<br />Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
1852600 1855850 It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.
1855940 1859440 You did lose a lot of versatile solutions<br />for modern living.
1859530 1862190 Fuck, you're right. No, I don't smoke.
1865620 1868660 My insurance is probably<br />gonna cover it, so...
1872290 1876580 - What?<br />- The things you own end up owning you.
1880000 1882170 But do what you like, man.
1884130 1885680 Oh, it's late.
1886300 1888970 - Hey, thanks for the beer.<br />- Yeah, man.
1889180 1891060 I should find a hotel.
1892209 1893539 What?
1893810 1894850 What?
1894940 1896480 - A hotel?<br />- Yeah.
1896900 1899770 - Just ask, man.<br />- What are you talking about?
1899860 1903400 Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer<br />and you still can't ask.
1906490 1907450 - What?<br />- You called me
1907530 1909450 'cause you need a place to stay.
1909530 1913040 - Oh, hey. No, no, no.<br />- Yes, you did. So just ask.
1913120 1915660 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
1917500 1919670 Would... Would that be a problem?
1919750 1922050 Is it a problem for you to ask?
1922960 1925300 - Can I stay at your place?<br />- Yeah.
1927010 1928180 Thanks.
1932720 1935600 - I want you to do me a favour.<br />- Yeah, sure.
1935850 1938600 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1939110 1943690 - What?<br />- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1944610 1946740 <i>Let me tell you a little bit<br />about Tyler Durden.</i>
1948030 1952030 Tyler was a night person.<br />While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked.
1952120 1954950 He had one part-time job<br />as a projectionist.
1955040 1958540 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.<br />It comes on a few.
1958630 1962000 So someone has to be there to switch<br />the projectors at the exact moment
1962090 1964590 that one reel ends<br />and the next one begins.
1964670 1969640 If you look for them, you can see little dots come<br />into the upper right corner of the screen.
1969720 1972550 In the industry,<br />we call them cigarette burns.
1972640 1974350 That's the cue for a changeover.
1974430 1979230 He flips the projectors, movie keeps right on<br />going and nobody in the audience has any idea.
1979560 1982060 Why would anyone want this shit job?
1982150 1984940 'Cause it affords him other<br />interesting opportunities.
1985030 1987990 Like splicing a frame of pornography<br />into family films.
1988070 1990660 So when the snooty cat<br />and the courageous dog
1990740 1993990 with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel three,
1994080 1997790 that's when you'll catch a flash<br />of Tyler's contribution to the film.
2005260 2007510 Nobody knows<br />that they saw it but they did.
2007590 2009590 Nice big cock.
2014760 2017430 Even a hummingbird<br />couldn't catch Tyler at work.
2022900 2027650 Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet<br />waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
2032780 2036490 He was the guerrilla terrorist<br />of the food service industry.
2036950 2039120 Do not watch.<br />I cannot go when you watch.
2039210 2041040 Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
2041120 2043750 he farted on meringues,<br />sneezed on braised endives...
2043840 2046460 As for the cream of mushroom soup, well...
2046550 2049970 - Go ahead, tell 'em.<br />- You get the idea.
2050380 2052146 What do you want me to do?<br />You just want me to hit you?
2052148 2053721 Come on. Do me this one favour.
2053800 2054620 Why?
2054622 2057061 Why? I don't know why. I don't know.<br />Never been in a fight. You?
2057140 2058804 No. But that's a good thing.
2058829 2061718 No it is not. How much can you know about<br />yourself if you've never been in a fight?
2061730 2063900 I don't wanna die without any scars.
2063980 2068190 - Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.<br />- Oh, God. This is crazy.
2068280 2070240 So go crazy! Let her rip.
2070700 2073570 - I don't know about this.<br />- I don't either.
2073660 2076580 Who gives a shit? No one's watching.<br />What do you care?
2076660 2078990 This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
2079080 2080580 That's right.
2081210 2084170 - Where? Like, in the face?<br />- Surprise me.
2086590 2088630 This is so fucking stupid.
2099310 2103770 Motherfucker! You hit me in the ear!
2103850 2107020 - Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.<br />- Ow! Christ!
2107520 2108770 Why the ear, man?
2108860 2111320 - I fucked it up.<br />- No, that was perfect.
2124040 2126040 No, it's all right.
2127420 2129250 It really hurts.
2129550 2130710 Right.
2131970 2136340 - Hit me again.<br />- No, you hit me. Come on!
2153280 2155780 We should do this again sometime.
2168500 2170630 - Where's your car?<br />- What car?
2181760 2186020 <i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,<br />but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>
2186100 2189270 <i>It looked like it was<br />waiting to be torn down.</i>
2189360 2191730 <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>
2191820 2193320 <i>There was no lock on the front door</i>
2193400 2196490 <i>from when the police,<br />or whoever, kicked it in.</i>
2196700 2199200 <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>
2199280 2202120 <i>I didn't know if he owned it<br />or if he was squatting.</i>
2202200 2204700 <i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>
2205040 2206620 Yep. That's you.
2207460 2209920 That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
2210000 2211460 Yeah, thanks.
2212800 2214420 <i>What a shithole.</i>
2215630 2217300 <i>Nothing worked.</i>
2220260 2224060 <i>Turning on one light meant<br />another light in the house went out.</i>
2224140 2227430 <i>There were no neighbours.<br />Just some warehouses and a paper mill.</i>
2227520 2231440 <i>That fart smell of steam.<br />The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>
2233440 2235440 Hey. What have we here?
2250710 2252330 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hey.
2264390 2267560 <i>Every time it rained,<br />we had to kill the power.</i>
2267640 2271100 <i>By the end of the first month,<br />I didn't miss TV.</i>
2272270 2275770 <i>I didn't even mind the warm,<br />stale refrigerator.</i>
2288700 2290370 Can I be next?
2294710 2296210 All right, man.
2296300 2297750 Lose the tie.

2326120 2328370 - Hey man, what are you reading?<br />- Listen to this.
2328450 2331910 It's an article written<br />by an organ in the first person.
2332000 2334330 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
2334420 2336170 "Without me, Jack could not regulate

2341170 2345510 "I Am Jill's Nipples."<br />"I Am Jack's Colon."
2345600 2348180 Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

2378960 2380710 I don't know my dad.
2380800 2384470 I mean, I know him, but he left<br />when I was, like, six years old.
2384550 2387090 Married this other woman<br />and had some other kids.
2387180 2389050 He, like, did this every six years.
2389140 2393810 - He goes to a new city and starts a new family.<br />- Fucker's setting up franchises.
2395690 2399560 My dad never went to college,<br />so it was real important that I go.
2399650 2401070 That sounds familiar.
2401150 2404990 So I graduate. I call him up long distance<br />and say, "Dad, now what?"
2405070 2407240 - He says, "Get a job."<br />- Same here.
2407320 2411990 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.<br />"Dad, now what?"
2412200 2414540 He says, "I dunno. Get married."
2416790 2418670 You can't get married.
2419090 2420960 I'm a 30-year-old boy.
2421210 2424300 We're a generation of men<br />raised by women.
2424380 2428180 I'm wondering if another woman<br />is really the answer we need.
2433980 2437190 <i>Most of the week,<br />we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>
2438520 2442070 <i>But every Saturday night,<br />we were finding something out.</i>
2442980 2446530 <i>We were finding out more and more<br />that we were not alone.</i>
2450370 2454490 <i>It used to be that when I came home angry<br />or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>
2454580 2457000 <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>
2457290 2459620 <i>I should have been<br />looking for a new condo.</i>
2459710 2462290 <i>I should have been haggling<br />with my insurance company.</i>
2462380 2467170 <i>I should have been upset about my nice,<br />neat, flaming little shit, but I wasn't.</i>
2467510 2471390 The basic premise of cybernetting any office<br />is make things more efficient.
2471470 2474720 <i>Monday mornings, all I could do<br />was think about next week.</i>
2474810 2477680 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
2477770 2479270 Absolutely.
2479560 2482060 Efficiency is priority no. 1, people.
2482400 2484690 Because waste is a thief.
2485480 2489070 I showed this already to my man here.<br />You liked it, didn't you?
2492580 2495870 <i>You can swallow a pint of blood<br />before you get sick.</i>
2497500 2501580 <i>It was right in everyone's face.<br />Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>
2501750 2506420 <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.<br />Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>
2517430 2520270 Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
2541750 2544290 Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
2566110 2569570 <i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules<br />that he and I decided.</i>
2569650 2571150 Gentlemen!
2571740 2573700 Welcome to Fight Club.
2576240 2580250 The first rule of Fight Club is<br />you do not talk about Fight Club.
2581000 2583500 The second rule of Fight Club is...
2583670 2586460 you do not talk about Fight Club!
2587500 2588920 Third rule of Fight Club:
2589000 2592510 someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
2592590 2594260 the fight is over.
2594640 2597260 Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
2597970 2600770 Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
2602180 2604810 Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
2605190 2609230 Seventh rule: fights will go on<br />as long as they have to.
2611650 2617070 And the eighth and final rule: if this is<br />your first night at Fight Club,
2618120 2619280 you have to fight.
2624170 2625920 <i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>
2626000 2630300 <i>couldn't remember whether<br />you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>
2631550 2633470 <i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>
2633550 2637180 <i>when he trounced<br />the maître d' of a local food court.</i>
2639390 2641010 <i>Sometimes,<br />all you could hear were the flat,</i>
2641100 2644060 <i>hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>
2647610 2650770 <i>Or the wet choke when someone<br />caught their breath and sprayed...</i>
2650860 2652070 Stop!
2652610 2655280 <i>You weren't alive anywhere<br />like you were there.</i>
2655360 2660370 <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours<br />between when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends.</i>
2661290 2663660 <i>Even if I could tell someone<br />they had a good fight,</i>
2663750 2666120 <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>
2666210 2667540 <i>Who you were in Fight Club</i>
2667630 2670500 <i>is not who you were<br />in the rest of the world.</i>
2670590 2674920 <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first<br />time. His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>
2675010 2678260 <i>After a few weeks,<br />he was carved out of wood.</i>
2678930 2681850 If you could fight any celebrity,<br />who would you fight?
2681930 2685060 - Alive or dead?<br />- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2686140 2688440 Hemingway. You?
2689900 2692940 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2694860 2697650 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>
2698360 2701740 <i>Everywhere we went,<br />we were sizing things up.</i>
2705790 2708330 <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>
2708420 2712460 <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein<br />or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>
2712550 2714960 Is that what a man looks like?
2715420 2718130 Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
2718550 2720760 Now, self-destruction...
2720840 2722260 Excuse me.
2757420 2760010 <i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>
2760090 2762050 <i>It wasn't about words.</i>
2764680 2769480 <i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,<br />like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>
2774570 2776360 - Is that it?<br />- Stop!
2776820 2779780 <i>When the fight was over,<br />nothing was solved.</i>
2780200 2781860 <i>But nothing mattered.</i>
2781950 2783030 Cool.
2785410 2787910 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>
2788000 2790410 Hey, man. How about next week?
2791500 2793420 How about next month?
2793750 2796840 Irvine, you're in the middle.<br />New guy, you too.
2799380 2801300 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>
2801380 2803380 He fell down some stairs.
2804010 2806100 I fell down some stairs.
2808270 2812640 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut<br />your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>
2812730 2814730 Okay. Any historical figure.
2815810 2819480 - I'd fight Gandhi.<br />- Good answer.
2820440 2822400 - How about you?<br />- Lincoln.
2822780 2824410 Lincoln?
2825030 2828660 Big guy, big reach.<br />Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
2829040 2830120 Fuck!
2832540 2835290 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
2844220 2845220 Hello?
2845300 2848140 <i>Where have you been<br />the last eight weeks?</i>
2848649 2849470 <i>Marla?</i>
2852850 2855940 - How did you find me?<br /><i>- You left a forwarding number.</i>
2856020 2858820 I haven't seen you at any support groups.
2858940 2861860 <i>We split 'em up.<br />That was the idea. Remember?</i>
2862320 2865150 Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
2865360 2868070 - How do you know?<br />- I cheated.
2869200 2870870 I found a new one.
2871160 2873290 - Really?<br />- It's for men only.
2873500 2875080 Like the testicle thing?
2879590 2883170 - Look, this is a bad time.<br />- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
2883260 2886220 <i>- You wanna see some really fucked-up people...</i><br />- I'm just on my way out.
2886300 2889100 Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
2889470 2893470 I took what was left of a bottle.<br />It might have been too much.
2893560 2897560 <i>Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself<br />around her crummy apartment.</i>
2897650 2901480 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.<br />This is probably one of those cry for help things.
2902070 2903650 <i>This could go on for hours.</i>
2903740 2907910 - So you're staying-in tonight then?<br />- Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?
2908820 2912910 <i>Do you wanna listen<br />and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>
2915080 2917170 <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>
2943530 2945610 <i>Tyler's door was closed.</i>
2945690 2948860 <i>I'd been living here for two months<br />and Tyler's door was never closed.</i>
2954870 2957290 You won't believe the dream<br />I had last night.
2957370 2960420 I can hardly believe<br />anything from last night.
2970390 2972350 What are you doing here?
2976230 2977680 - What?<br />- This is my house.
2977770 2979770 What are you doing in my house?
2981900 2983190 Fuck you!
2998370 3001460 Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends! I'm telling you.
3002710 3005913 Limber, though. Silly cooze.
3007460 3011380 So I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.<br />Guess who's on the other end.
3011470 3013970 <i>I already knew the story<br />before he told it to me.</i>
3017430 3020560 <i>Have you ever heard<br />a death rattle before?</i>
3020640 3023600 Do you think it'll live up to its name?
3023690 3026570 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>
3029860 3033320 <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>
3033950 3038620 <i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>
3038790 3041960 <i>Now how could Tyler, of all people,<br />think it was a bad thing</i>
3042040 3044630 <i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>
3045090 3049800 <i>...five, four, three...</i>
3050090 3051510 <i>Hang on.</i>
3056560 3058640 You got here fast.
3061140 3062690 Did I call you?
3064100 3065150 Huh?
3073490 3076620 The mattress is all sealed<br />in slippery plastic.
3079240 3081910 Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
3085290 3088960 Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
3101100 3104020 - Hey, where's 513?<br />- End of the hall.
3105440 3108940 The girl who lives there<br />used to be a charming, lovely girl.
3109020 3111150 She has lost faith in herself.
3111230 3113990 - Miss Singer, let us help you!<br />- She's a monster!
3114070 3118280 - You have every reason to live.<br />- She's infectious human waste!
3118370 3121290 - Miss Singer!<br />- Good luck trying to save her!
3127710 3131210 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
3132920 3135380 You're gonna have to keep me up...
3135880 3137550 all night.
3137970 3139890 Un-fucking-believable.
3140390 3142220 <i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>
3142310 3145690 - You know what I mean. You fucked her.<br />- No, I didn't.
3147230 3148560 - Never?<br />- No.
3150320 3153610 - You're not into her, are you?<br />- No! God, not at all.
3153990 3156150 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>
3156240 3159820 - Are you sure? You can tell me.<br />- Believe me, I'm sure.
3159910 3161160 <i>Put a gun to my head</i>
3161240 3163490 <i>- and paint the walls with my brains.</i><br />- That's good.
3163580 3166790 She's a predator posing as a house pet.<br />Stay away from her.
3169750 3172500 The shit that came out of<br />this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
3172590 3173750 My God.
3174130 3177430 I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.
3178758 3180390 <i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>
3180470 3183810 <i>The night before last, he was splicing<br />sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>
3183890 3186230 Marla doesn't need a lover,<br />she needs a fucking caseworker.
3186310 3189440 She needs a wash.<br />This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
3189900 3192900 <i>She invaded my support groups<br />and now she'd invaded my home.</i>
3192980 3194730 Hey, hey. Sit down.
3199200 3203080 - Listen, I can't have you talking to her about me.<br />- Why would I talk to her?
3203160 3204950 You say anything about me<br />or what goes on
3205040 3208330 in this house to her or anybody,<br />we're done.
3209170 3210960 - Now promise me.<br />- Okay.
3211460 3213040 - You promise?<br />- Yeah, I promise.
3213130 3215960 - Promise.<br />- I just said, I promise! What...
3216050 3218380 That's three times you promised.
3219590 3223760 <i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes<br />and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>
3223850 3226140 <i>none of this would've happened.</i>
3230520 3232860 Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
3240910 3243530 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>
3243620 3247500 <i>On the third floor<br />where I might not have heard them.</i>
3248080 3249540 <i>But I didn't.</i>
3273940 3276940 - What are you doing?<br />- Just going to bed.
3278570 3281280 - You wanna finish her off?<br />- Ooh!
3282740 3285780 - No. No, thank you.<br />- I found a cigarette.
3287410 3289410 - Who were you talking to?<br />- Shut up.
3290710 3293870 <i>I became the calm<br />little centre of the world.</i>
3293960 3295790 <i>I was the Zen master.</i>
3301090 3303220 <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>
3303890 3306100 <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>
3307010 3308720 Is that your blood?
3310890 3312100 Some of it, yeah.
3312190 3313640 You can't smoke in here.
3316020 3319650 Take the rest of the day off.<br />Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
3319730 3321530 Get yourself together.
3321610 3326530 <i>I got right in everyone's hostile little face.<br />"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>
3326780 3330410 <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that.<br />I am enlightened."</i>
3333000 3337420 <i>You give up the condo life, give up<br />all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>
3337840 3341630 <i>go live in a dilapidated house<br />in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>
3341720 3343920 <i>and you have to come home to this.</i>
3355690 3356690 Hello?
3356770 3359860 <i>Yes, this is Detective Stern<br />with the Arson Unit.</i>
3360400 3364360 <i>We have new information about<br />the incident at your former condo.</i>
3364450 3366240 - Yes?<br />- I don't know if you're aware,
3366320 3370370 but it seems that someone sprayed Freon<br />into your front-door lock.
3370450 3373370 <i>Then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>
3373460 3376870 - No, I wasn't aware of that at all.<br /><i>- I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>
3377290 3381300 - Does this sound strange to you?<br /><i>- Yes, sir. Strange. Very strange.</i>
3381840 3383380 - The dynamite...<br />- Dynamite?
3383470 3387510 ...left a residue of<br />ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
3388050 3391430 <i>- Do you know what this means?</i><br />- No. What does it mean?
3391640 3393640 It means it was home-made.
3394430 3397350 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3397440 3400400 See whoever set this dynamite<br />could have blown out
3400480 3403400 your pilot light days before the actual explosion.
3403490 3406320 <i>- The gas was just a detonator.</i><br />- Who'd go and do such a thing?
3406400 3408820 <i>- I'll ask the questions.</i><br />- Tell him.
3409320 3413160 "Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property<br />realigned my perceptions."
3413250 3414700 <i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>
3414790 3418290 I am listening. it's a little hard<br />to know what to make of all this.
3418380 3420420 Have you recently made enemies with anyone
3420500 3422710 who might have access<br />to home-made dynamite?
3422800 3425380 - Enemies?<br />- "I reject the basic assumption of civilization,
3425470 3427470 "especially the importance<br />of material possessions."
3427550 3430180 <i>- Son, this is serious.</i><br />- Yes, I know it's serious.
3430260 3433100 <i>- I mean that.</i><br />- Yes, it's very serious.
3433180 3438980 Look, nobody takes this more seriously<br />than me. That condo was my life. Okay?
3439520 3442230 I loved every stick of<br />furniture in that place.
3442320 3445530 <i>That was not just a bunch of stuff<br />that got destroyed.</i>
3445610 3448110 - It was me!<br /><i>- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>
3448200 3452450 <i>- Is this not a good time for you?</i><br />- Just tell him you fucking did it!
3452700 3456790 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3456870 3460750 <i>- Are you still there?</i><br />- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
3460830 3465500 No, no. I may need to talk to you a little further,<br />so how about you just let me know if you're gonna leave town?
3466300 3467720 <i>- Okay?</i><br />- Okay.
3471340 3472470 <i>Except for their humping,</i>
3472550 3475390 <i>Tyler and Marla were never<br />in the same room.</i>
3475470 3478140 <i>My parents pulled<br />this exact same act for years.</i>
3478230 3481600 The condom is the glass slipper<br />of our generation.
3482560 3485400 You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
3485570 3489280 You dance all night,<br />then you throw it away.
3490280 3493030 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3494410 3495490 What?
3500330 3503170 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
3503250 3505040 It was worth every penny.
3505130 3507170 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3509220 3513180 Someone loved it intensely for one day,
3514390 3515970 then tossed it.
3517600 3519430 Like a Christmas tree.
3519980 3521520 So special.
3522810 3524770 Then... bam!
3525650 3527860 It's on the side of the road.
3528400 3530530 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3532490 3539290 Like a sex-crime victim, underwear<br />inside out, bound with electrical tape.
3539790 3541790 Well, then, it suits you.
3542290 3544420 You can borrow it sometime.
3551630 3553130 Get rid of her.
3553970 3556550 - What? Hey, you get rid of her!<br />- Don't mention me.
3556640 3560850 <i>I am six years old again,<br />passing messages between parents.</i>
3564230 3566980 - You know what? I really think it's time you got out of here.<br />- Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3567070 3571940 - Not that we don't love your little visits.<br />- You know, you're such a nutcase. I can't even begin to keep up.

3576320 3577320 Thanks. Bye.

3592840 3594090 You kids!
3595550 3598260 Why do you still waste time with her?
3599680 3602810 I'll say this about Marla.<br />At least she's trying to hit bottom.
3602890 3604310 What, and I'm not?
3604640 3608360 Sticking feathers up your butt<br />does not make you a chicken.
3608690 3610570 What are we doing tonight?
3610650 3612690 Tonight... we make soap.
3613820 3617070 - Really?<br />- To make soap, first we render fat.
3637390 3638800 The salt balance has to be just right,
3638890 3641970 so the best fat for making soap<br />comes from humans.
3642720 3645890 - Wait. What is this place?<br />- A liposuction clinic.
3654600 3655530 Pay dirt!
3656400 3660240 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />The fat of the land!
3665910 3668750 No! Don't pull it.
3673460 3675880 - Oh, God!<br />- Give me another one.
3683220 3687640 As the fat renders, the tallows float<br />to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
3688020 3691610 - It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.<br />- Keep stirring.
3693980 3697530 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerine.
3697610 3699860 If you would add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
3699950 3704160 If you then add sodium nitrate<br />and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.
3705160 3707910 Yeah, with enough soap,<br />one could blow up just about anything.
3708000 3710670 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>
3710750 3714340 Now, ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner<br />when thay washed them at a certain point in the river.
3714420 3715750 - You know why?<br />- No.
3719880 3722720 'Cause human sacrifices were once made<br />on the hills above this river.
3722800 3726520 Bodies burned, water seeped<br />through the wooden ashes to create lye.
3727060 3729060 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3729131 3733681 Once it mixed with the melted fat of the bodies,<br />thick white soapy discharge crept into the river.
3733770 3736070 May I see your hand, please?
3743120 3744450 What is this?
3744530 3747330 This is a chemical burn.
3747410 3750750 It'll hurt more than you've ever<br />been burned and you'll have a scar.
3750830 3753330 <i>God, if meditation worked for cancer,<br />it could work for this.</i>
3754000 3756420 - Stay with the pain. Don't shut this out.<br />- No no Oh, God!
3757391 3758375 Look at your hand.
3758420 3760380 The first soap was made<br />from the ashes of heroes,
3760470 3762260 like the first monkey shot into space.
3762340 3765470 Without pain, without sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3765560 3768310 <i>I tried not to think<br />of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>
3768390 3771310 Stop it! This is your pain,<br />this is your burning hand. It's right here.
3771390 3774480 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3774560 3778230 No! Don't deal with it the way<br />those dead people do! Come on!
3778320 3779320 - I get the point! Okay, please!<br />- No!
3779400 3781700 What you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
3786200 3788990 It's the greatest moment of your life, man,<br />and you're off somewhere missing it!
3789080 3790620 I am not...
3791210 3794120 Shut up! Our fathers<br />were our models for God.
3794210 3797090 If our fathers bailed,<br />what does that tell you about God?
3798550 3803880 Listen to me. You have to consider<br />the possibility that God does not like you.
3804010 3807640 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, he hates you.
3807720 3811140 This is not the worst thing<br />that can happen. We don't need him!
3811230 3814390 - We don't! I agree!<br />- Fuck damnation man, fuck redemption.
3814480 3816980 We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
3817070 3821030 - I'm getting water!<br />- Listen! You can run water over your hand & make it worse or...
3821110 3822650 Look at me!
3822740 3825860 - Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />- Please let me have it, please!
3825950 3828200 First, you have to give up.
3828580 3831080 First, you have to know, not fear,
3831330 3834210 know that someday, you're gonna die.
3834290 3836580 You don't know how this feels!
3841460 3845510 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3846260 3847340 Okay.
3862940 3866570 Congratulations.<br />You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
3869700 3873370 <i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores<br />at $20 a bar.</i>
3873450 3874960 <i>God knows what they charged.</i>
3875040 3878880 - This is the best soap.<br />- Why, thank you, Susan.
3879290 3880840 <i>It was beautiful.</i>
3880920 3884630 <i>We were selling rich women<br />their own fat asses back to them.</i>

3905490 3907900 You find this. What would you do?
3912870 3914790 Well, I gotta tell you,
3914950 3918250 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3918330 3921790 Because the person who wrote that<br />is dangerous.
3921880 3926340 And this button-down,<br />Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap
3926420 3929300 and then stalk from office to office
3929390 3934810 with an Armalite AR10 carbine<br />gas-powered semi-automatic weapon,
3934890 3938520 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3940190 3943150 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.

3960540 3963380 - Compliance and Liability.<br />- My tit's gonna rot off.
3965710 3968420 Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
3974010 3975060 What are you talking about.
3975140 3978140 I need you to check and see<br />if there's a lump in my breast.
3978230 3982060 - Go to a hospital.<br />- I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
3982770 3985070 I don't know about this, Marla.
3985230 3986650 Please?
3986730 3989900 <i>She didn't call Tyler.<br />I'm neutral in her book.</i>
3992370 3996450 That's nice. Taking food to...<br />Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
3996700 3998500 Where are they, exactly?
3998580 4003170 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4003250 4005090 - No, no.<br />- I got one for you.
4005170 4007090 Thanks for the thought.
4008420 4010550 What happened to your hand?
4011050 4012430 Oh, nothing.
4013890 4015510 Right there?
4016430 4018850 - Feel anything?<br />- No.
4018980 4020600 Well, make sure.
4021980 4025110 - Okay, I'm pretty sure.<br />- You feel nothing?
4026270 4027690 No, nothing.
4029440 4031950 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
4033700 4036870 - No problem.<br />- I wish I could return the favour.
4036950 4039330 There's not a lot of breast cancer<br />in the men of my family.
4039410 4042160 - I could check your prostate.<br />- I think I'm okay.
4043120 4044960 Well, thanks, anyway.
4049840 4052220 - Are we done?<br />- Yeah, we're done.

4078830 4080330 Hey, Bob.
4084290 4087420 - We all thought you were dead.<br />- No, no. Still here.
4087500 4089420 How are you, Bob?
4089500 4091220 Better than I've ever<br />been in my whole life.
4091300 4094220 Really? Still Remaining Men Together?
4094340 4096380 No, no.<br />I got something so much better now.
4096470 4099220 Really, what is it?
4099310 4101180 Well...
4101270 4105060 The first rule is,<br />I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4106270 4107810 And the second rule is...
4107900 4109560 I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4109650 4113320 - And the third rule is...<br />- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
4114200 4116200 Look at my face, Bob.
4118200 4120490 That's fucking great.
4120580 4123830 - I've never seen you there.<br />- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4124870 4128040 - I go Saturday.<br />- Congratulations.
4128830 4130630 Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?
4130710 4133760 Have you heard about the guy<br />that invented this thing?
4133840 4136550 - Yeah, actually...<br />- I hear all kinds of things.
4136630 4140850 Supposedly, he was born<br />in a mental institution
4140930 4144640 and he sleeps only one hour a night.
4144730 4147230 - He's a great man.<br />- Oh...
4147730 4150060 Do you know about Tyler Durden?
4175260 4177380 I didn't hurt you, did I?
4177470 4180010 Actually, you did.
4180090 4183680 Thank you for this.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4183760 4186220 <i>Fight Club.</i>
4186310 4188020 <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>
4188770 4190520 <i>Our gift to the world.</i>
4190600 4194110 I look around, I look around,<br />I see a lot of new faces.
4196030 4197820 Shut up!
4198780 4203620 Which means a lot of people have been<br />breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
4211000 4215710 Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest<br />and smartest men who've ever lived.
4215800 4218880 I see all this potential.<br />And I see it squandered.
4221050 4224390 Goddamn it,<br />an entire generation pumping gas.
4224470 4226260 Waiting tables.
4226350 4228770 Slaves with white collars.
4230980 4233900 Advertising has us chasing<br />cars and clothes.
4233980 4237440 Working jobs we hate<br />so we can buy shit we don't need.
4241160 4245490 We're the middle children of history, men.<br />No purpose or place.
4246330 4248410 We have no Great War.
4248500 4250500 No Great Depression.
4252210 4255130 Our great war is a spiritual war.
4255210 4257880 Our great depression is our lives.
4262340 4265680 We've all been raised on television to<br />believe that one day we'd all be millionaires
4265760 4268140 and movie gods and rock stars.
4268220 4270140 But we won't.
4270230 4273190 We're slowly learning that fact.
4273270 4276190 And we're very, very pissed off.
4276270 4278270 Yeah!
4280860 4283780 First rule of Fight Club is,<br />you do not talk about...
4290160 4292120 Who are you?
4292210 4294790 - Who am I?<br />- Yeah.
4296040 4299550 There's a sign on the front<br />that says Lou's Tavern.
4299630 4303970 I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
4304050 4305640 Tyler Durden.
4308680 4311600 Who told you motherfuckers<br />that you could use my place?
4311680 4313812 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
4313883 4314719 Irvine?
4314770 4319270 Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.<br />He don't own this place. I do.
4322150 4325070 - How much money does he get for this?<br />- There is no money.
4325160 4326910 - Really?<br />- Free to all.
4326990 4330160 - Ain't that something.<br />- It is, actually.
4330240 4332290 Look, stupid fuck!
4332370 4337380 - I want everybody out of here right now.<br />- Hey! You should join our club.
4338500 4341750 - Did you hear what I just said?<br />- You and your friend.
4345050 4346590 You hear me now?
4348260 4350260 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
4356980 4359770 Still not getting it.
4360391 4361570 Okay, okay, okay, I got it.
4361650 4364110 I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
4365610 4367740 Back! All of you!
4368700 4370700 Everybody back!
4378330 4379710 Ah, Lou!
4380840 4384550 Come on, man! We really like this place.
4393970 4396560 - That's right, Lou. Get it out.<br />- Shut the fuck up.
4396640 4398230 Oh, yeah!
4402820 4404860 That's fucking funny?
4414200 4416910 Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
4418000 4419670 Unbelievable.
4424170 4426550 - You don't know where I've been, Lou.<br />- Oh, my God!
4427720 4430090 You don't know where I've been!
4433350 4436270 Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
4436350 4441350 - Fucking use the basement! Christ!<br />- I want your word, Lou! I want your word!
4441440 4443190 On my mother's eyes.
4452870 4454240 Thanks, Lou.
4456620 4458370 You too, big guy.
4462420 4464380 We'll see you next week.
4480060 4483690 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4485020 4489280 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4491910 4494030 You're gonna start a fight,
4494620 4496490 and you're gonna lose.
4499250 4501370 Excellent choice, sir.
4502750 4505460 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4505750 4508170 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>
4511680 4513550 What... Son of a bitch!
4513847 4518317 <i>Most people, normal people,<br />do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>
4520020 4521520 Excuse me!
4521600 4523850 You sprayed me with your hose.
4523940 4525440 That's not necessary.
4525520 4527190 Jay! Go call 911!
4530030 4531190 Put the hose down.
4531950 4533780 Stop it! Stop it!
4537080 4538330 Sorry.
4546637 4547717 You bastard!
4553470 4555090 We need to talk.
4557810 4558970 Okay.
4560930 4562140 Where to begin?
4562310 4564890 With your constant absenteeism?
4564980 4567860 With your unpresentable appearance?
4567980 4572690 - You're up for review.<br />- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4572780 4574740 - What?<br />- Let's pretend.
4574820 4577700 You're the Department<br />of Transportation, okay?
4578330 4583410 Someone informs you that this company<br />installs front-seat mounting brackets
4583540 4585670 that never pass collision tests,
4585750 4588920 brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
4589000 4592840 and fuel injectors<br />that explode and burn people alive.
4594340 4595680 What then?
4596300 4598640 - Are you threatening me?<br />- No...
4598720 4602060 - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!<br />- I have a better solution.
4602520 4605560 Keep me on the payroll<br />as an outside consultant
4606100 4607600 and, in exchange for my salary,
4607690 4611570 my job will be never to tell people<br />these things that I know.
4612480 4617110 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4617200 4621450 Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,<br />you crazy little shit?
4626170 4629960 - Security!<br /><i>- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

4650270 4651650 That hurt.
4654280 4656400 Why would you do that?
4656610 4659240 Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
4669750 4671580 What are you doing?
4672090 4674130 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4674250 4677800 <i>For some reason,<br />I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

4718470 4721760 <i>And right then,<br />at our most excellent moment together...</i>

4743910 4748160 <i>Now, nobody was the centre of Fight Club<br />except the two men fighting.</i>
4749040 4752210 <i>The leader walked through the crowd,<br />out in the darkness.</i>

4780530 4783150 <i>Tyler dreamed up<br />new homework assignments.</i>
4783240 4786030 <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

4830580 4835160 There's one in Penns Grove too.<br />Bob even found one up in New Castle.
4835250 4837960 - Yeah, did you start that one?<br />- No, I thought you did.
4838040 4839130 No.
4890050 4891890 - Stop for a second.<br />- What are we doing?
4891970 4893680 - Turn around.<br />- What are we doing?
4893770 4896390 - Homework assignment.<br />- What kind?
4896480 4898100 Human sacrifice.

4920420 4923750 Raymond K. Hessel.<br />1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.
4923880 4925500 Small, cramped basement apartment Raymond?
4925590 4926582 How did you know?
4926584 4929131 'Cause they give shitty basement apartments<br />letters instead of numbers.
4929890 4932930 Raymond! You're going to die.
4933010 4934180 No!
4935310 4936560 Is that your mom and dad?
4936640 4939140 Mom and dad are gonna have to<br />call up kindly Dr. So-And-So
4939230 4941350 Pick up your dental records.<br />You want to know why?
4941440 4944770 - 'Cause there's going to be nothing left of your face..<br />- Aw, come on!
4945190 4949400 An expired community college student ID.<br />What did you study, Raymond?
4949860 4952360 - S... Stuff.<br />- Stuff?
4952450 4954370 Were the midterms hard?
4955660 4958370 - I asked you what you studied!<br />- Biology, mostly.
4958460 4961580 - Why?<br />- I don't know.
4961670 4964380 What did you wanna be,<br />Raymond K. Hessel?
4966130 4970300 The question, Raymond, was:<br />what did you want to be?
4972260 4973680 Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!
4973760 4976310 - Veterinarian. Veterinarian.<br />- Animals.
4976390 4979060 - Yeah. Animal and stuff.<br />- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
4979140 4982230 - That means that you have to get more schooling.<br />- Too much school.
4982400 4984360 - Would you rather be dead?<br />- No, please...
4984440 4988780 You'd rather die, here, on your knees,<br />in the back of a convenience store?
4989610 4991700 No. Please, no.
4995530 4997540 I'm keeping your license.
4998080 5001000 Gonna check in on you.<br />I know where you live.
5002370 5005080 If you're not on your way to becoming<br />a veterinarian in six weeks,
5005170 5006420 you will be dead.
5009050 5010670 Now run on home.
5015470 5017430 Run, Forrest, run!
5018970 5020350 I feel ill.
5022640 5025810 - Imagine how he feels.<br />- Come on, this isn't funny!
5025900 5029110 That wasn't funny. What the<br />fuck was the point of that?
5029190 5032860 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day<br />of Raymond K. Hessel's life.
5032950 5037410 His breakfast will taste better<br />than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
5038660 5040950 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>
5041250 5043290 - Come on.<br /><i>- He had a plan.</i>
5043370 5046670 <i>And it started to make sense<br />in a Tyler sort of way.</i>
5046750 5050050 <i>No fear. No distractions.</i>
5050130 5054260 <i>The ability to let that<br />which does not matter truly slide.</i>
5067650 5069570 <i>You are not your job.</i>
5071780 5073860 You're not how much money<br />you have in the bank.
5076740 5078990 You're not the car you drive.
5079410 5082330 You're not the contents of your wallet.
5083290 5085870 You're not your fucking khakis.
5087500 5090210 You are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5099890 5102310 I'll be out of your way in a sec.
5103140 5104980 You don't have to go.
5106650 5107900 Whatever.
5109440 5112860 No, I mean... it's okay.
5122410 5124660 Are you still going to groups?
5125620 5126710 Yeah.
5128920 5130790 Chloe's dead.
5130880 5132250 Wow. Chloe.
5133960 5136300 When did that happen?
5136380 5137800 Do you care?
5138800 5141680 I dunno.<br />I haven't thought about it in a while.
5141760 5143220 Yeah, well...
5144100 5146560 it was the smart move on her part.
5148690 5150150 Listen, um...
5151060 5153770 What are you getting out of all this?
5153860 5154940 What?
5156070 5159070 I mean, all this. Why do you keep...
5159160 5161160 Is this making you happy?
5163080 5164910 Yeah, well, sometimes.
5166910 5168500 I don't know. I don't understand.
5168580 5174670 Why does a weaker person need to latch<br />on to a strong person? What is that?
5174750 5176760 What do you get out of it?
5178760 5183470 No... That's not the same thing at all.<br />It's totally different with us.
5183560 5184560 "Us"?
5185720 5189270 - What do you mean by "us"?<br />- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
5189390 5192257 - Hear what?<br />- You're not hearing all that noise? Hold on a second.
5192310 5195730 No, wait! What were you saying? Don't change<br />the subject! I want to talk about this.
5195820 5198610 - You're not talking about me, are you?<br />- No.
5198700 5199059 What?
5199061 5201951 That day you came over to my place,<br />playing doctor. What was going on there?
5202370 5205410 - What are you talking about?<br />- Nothing. Nothing.
5205490 5207490 - I don't think so.<br />- What do you want?
5207580 5209087 - Look at me.<br />- No. What?
5209111 5210259 Look at me.
5211460 5214210 - What is that?<br />- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
5214290 5217210 - My God. Who did this?<br />- A person.
5217340 5218710 Guy or girl?
5218800 5221430 - What do you care if it's a guy or a girl?<br />- What do you care if I ask?
5221510 5223140 - Its none of your business. Leave me alone.<br />- You're afraid to say.
5223220 5225930 - I am not afraid to say. Let me go.<br />- No! Talk to me.
5226010 5227810 Let go of me. Leave me alone!
5227890 5229890 - This conversation...<br />- This conversation...
5229980 5232480 - ...is over.<br />- ...is over.
5234480 5236900 I just can't win with you, can I?
5245370 5247307 Hey, this is getting a little old!
5249750 5251500 What is... What is all this?
5251580 5253330 What do you think?
5254750 5256750 Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
5257495 5258705 Hey!
5265800 5267890 Too young. Sorry.
5269720 5271310 What's all that?
5271390 5274980 Right, If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young.<br />Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
5275060 5276270 Applicant?
5276360 5279940 If the applicant then waits three days<br />without food, shelter or encouragement,
5280030 5282490 he may then enter and begin his training.
5282570 5284320 Training for what?
5289990 5291870 You think this is a game?
5291960 5294210 You're too young to train here,<br />end of story.
5294290 5296880 Quit wasting our time.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
5301510 5304220 Bad news, friend.
5304300 5306930 It's not gonna happen.
5307010 5308970 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
5309060 5312310 It's not the end of the world.<br />Just... go away.
5313810 5315020 Go.
5315850 5319310 You're trespassing<br />and I will have to call the police.
5323349 5326279 Don't you look at me! You think<br />you're ever getting in this house?
5326281 5327781 You're never getting<br />in this fucking house!
5327870 5331200 Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!<br />Get off my porch!
5331290 5334450 <i>Sooner or later,<br />we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>
5334540 5337750 I'm gonna go inside<br />and I'm gonna get a shovel.
5345590 5349390 Got two black shirts?<br />Two pair of black pants?
5349510 5352510 - Yes, sir.<br />- One pair black boots? Two pair of black socks?
5352600 5354060 - Sir.<br />- One black jacket?
5354140 5356350 - Sir.<br />- $300 personal burial money?
5356440 5358270 Yes, sir.
5360320 5361650 All right.
5372450 5374410 You're too old, fat man.
5375290 5378120 Your tits are too big.<br />Get the fuck off my porch.
5385920 5387300 Bob! Bob!
5403650 5406900 Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
5407030 5408740 Space monkey.
5409200 5412530 Ready to sacrifice himself<br />for the greater good.
5418160 5421080 You are too fucking old, fatty!
5421210 5426000 And you... You're too fucking blond!
5426170 5428550 Get out of here, the both of you!
5429260 5430590 <i>And so it went.</i>
5430680 5432430 Listen up, maggots.
5433140 5435430 You are not special.
5435520 5438640 You are not<br />a beautiful or unique snowflake.
5439520 5442810 You are the same decaying organic matter<br />as everything else.
5443560 5445730 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>
5445820 5450030 <i>We are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.</i>
5450110 5453030 <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>
5455370 5458120 <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>
5458200 5461830 <i>To what purpose? For what greater good?</i>
5465550 5467460 <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>
5472050 5477510 When he was like,<br />"You are not your job," I was like, "Yeah!"
5480440 5482560 - Hey, what's all this?<br />- Hey!
5485270 5487270 Okay!
5487360 5489440 - What's going on?<br />- We're celebrating.
5489530 5491780 - What are we celebrating?<br />- Go on.
5496330 5498700 - Hey.<br />- Let me get that for you.
5503170 5506420 <i>Same great taste.<br />Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>
5510010 5514510 <i>Investigators are on the scene right now.<br />Hold on, Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived.</i>
5514800 5518100 <i>Commissioner, could you please tell us<br />what you think has happened here?</i>
5518180 5522100 <i>We believe this is one of many<br />recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>
5522190 5525440 <i>somehow related to<br />underground boxing clubs.</i>
5525940 5529270 <i>We will be coordinating<br />a rigorous investigation.</i>
5530190 5533360 <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs<br />who just arrived on the scene here</i>
5533450 5538990 <i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out about an hour ago...</i><br />- She's hot.
5539200 5541240 <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>
5541580 5543160 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
5544670 5546880 - Holy shit!<br />- Yeah!
5553590 5555840 What the fuck did you guys do?
5556260 5558640 <i>Arson investigators<br />are on the premises...</i>
5564980 5569310 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions, sir.
5575490 5579320 The victory in the war against crime<br />will not come overnight.
5579580 5584040 It will take dedication and commitment<br />and, most of all, cooperation.
5584290 5587750 Streets are safer now.<br />There is hope in the inner city.
5588250 5591170 - However, this is only the beginning.<br />- I gotta take a piss.
5592000 5595590 These are the first steps<br />in a long journey.
5595680 5596970 That is why we have<br />created Project Hope...
5597050 5598390 Bob.
5598470 5601640 ...helping others<br />with prevention and enforcement.
5602520 5604720 Project Hope will be a joint effort
5604810 5607190 between the police<br />and community leaders.
5607850 5611520 It will be a powerful new weapon<br />in the war against crime.
5657965 5662870 - Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack, Bob.<br />- Man! His balls are ice-cold.
5663740 5666870 Hi. You're gonna call off<br />your rigorous investigation.
5666950 5669710 You're gonna publicly state that<br />there is no underground group
5669790 5673340 or these guys are gonna take your balls.
5673420 5678090 They're gonna send one to the New York Times<br />and one to the LA Times press release style.
5678170 5681890 Look, the people you are after<br />are the people you depend on.
5681970 5685970 We cook your meals. We haul your trash.<br />We connect your calls.
5686100 5689810 We drive your ambulances.<br />We guard you while you sleep.
5694270 5696070 Do not fuck with us.
5705700 5707080 Ball check!
5721970 5723680 Bob, this way.
5724720 5726180 Let's go.
5727390 5730390 <i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>
5730890 5731940 Hey!
5747620 5748870 Yeah!
5781400 5786490 <i>I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of<br />every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>
5789700 5792450 <i>I wanted to open<br />the dump valves on oil tankers</i>
5792540 5795790 <i>and smother all those French beaches<br />I'd never see.</i>
5800090 5802420 <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>
5819230 5821570 Where did you go, psycho boy?
5822990 5825900 I felt like destroying something beautiful.
5830080 5832660 - Get him to a fucking hospital.<br />- Yeah.
5844590 5848090 Don't worry, Mr. Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.
5849100 5850890 After you, Mr. Durden.
5852350 5853680 After you.
5871700 5874490 - Something on your mind, dear?<br />- No.
5874580 5877330 All right, yeah. Why wasn't I told<br />about Project Mayhem?
5877420 5880460 First rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions.
5880460 5881380 What are you talking about?
5881460 5885050 - Why didn't you include me in the beginning?<br />- Fight Club was the beginning.
5885130 5888340 Now it's moved out of the basements<br />and it's called Project Mayhem.
5888430 5891300 You and I started Fight Club together.<br />Do you remember that?
5891390 5893140 It's as much mine as it is yours, you know.
5893260 5894651 Is this about you and me?
5894653 5897271 - Yeah. I thought we were doing this together.<br />- You're missing the point.
5897350 5899480 This does not belong to us.
5899560 5902480 - We are not special.<br />- Fuck that. You should have told me.
5904320 5905360 Hey, Tyler!
5908070 5910160 - Goddamn it, Tyler!<br />- What do you want?
5910240 5913450 A statement of purpose? Should I email you?<br />Should I put this on your action item list?
5913530 5916160 - Aw, look...<br />- You decide your own level of involvement!
5916250 5918500 I will! I wanna know certain things first!
5918580 5921000 - The first rule of Project Mayhem...<br />- Shut up!
5922840 5923999 I wanna know what you're thinking.
5924000 5927150 Fuck what you know! You need to forget<br />about what you know. That's your problem.
5927170 5930430 Forget about what you think you know<br />about life, about friendship,
5930510 5933010 and especially about you and me.
5934260 5936890 What is that supposed to mean? What...
5939350 5941350 What are you doing?
5943060 5945020 Guys, what'll you wish you'd done<br />before you die?
5945110 5947730 - Paint a self-portrait.<br />- Build a house.
5948070 5950610 - And you?<br />- I don't know. Nothing.
5950700 5952950 - Get in the right lane.<br />- You have to know the answer to this question!
5953030 5955830 If you were to die right now,<br />how would you feel about your life?
5955910 5960290 I don't know! I wouldn't feel anything good about<br />my life. Is that what you want to hear me say?
5960370 5962120 - Come on!<br />- Not good enough.
5962210 5964380 Stop fucking around! Tyler!
5967510 5969130 Jesus Christ!
5969220 5971630 Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
5971720 5975600 Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!<br />I am sick of all your shit!
5977100 5979140 Okay, man. Okay.
5980020 5982230 - Quit screwing around. Take the wheel!<br />- Look at you!
5982390 5985560 - Take the wheel!<br />- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
5985650 5990280 - Why? Why? What are you talking about?<br />- Why do you think I blew up your condo?
5991725 5992490 What?
5992570 5996240 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.<br />It's not a goddamn seminar.
5997080 6000250 Stop trying to control everything<br />and just let go!
6003330 6005630 - Let go!<br />- All right. Fine.
6007210 6008340 Fine.
6067520 6069940 <i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>
6071150 6073230 <i>This must have been<br />what all those people felt like</i>
6073320 6076450 <i>before I filed them<br />as statistics in my reports.</i>
6077240 6078450 Goddamn!
6082620 6085250 We've just had a near-life experience!
6090630 6095510 <i>In the world I see, you're stalking elk<br />through the Grand Canyon forests</i>
6095590 6098300 <i>around the ruins of Rockefeller Centre.</i>
6100430 6104850 You'll wear leather clothes<br />that will last you the rest of your life.
6105230 6109150 You'll climb the great thick kudzu vines<br />that wrap the Sears Tower.
6110480 6114320 <i>And when you look down,<br />you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,</i>
6114990 6116240 <i>laying strips of venison</i>
6116320 6120450 <i>in the empty car-pool lane<br />of some abandoned superhighway.</i>
6133550 6135340 Feel better, champ.
6153730 6155150 <i>And then...</i>
6155230 6156650 Tyler?
6156740 6158400 <i>...Tyler was gone.</i>
6166870 6168330 <i>Was I asleep?</i>
6170370 6171750 <i>Had I slept?</i>
6171830 6174380 You are not a beautiful, unique<br />snowflake, you understand me?
6174460 6177510 <i>The house had become a living thing,</i>
6177590 6180930 <i>wet inside from so many people<br />sweating and breathing.</i>
6181010 6182590 We are all part<br />of the same compost heap...
6182680 6186810 <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>
6187980 6189850 <i>Planet Tyler.</i>
6189940 6194650 <i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside<br />this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>
6194940 6198110 You can't be smoking in here! You know<br />how much ether we have in this fucking house?
6198190 6201030 <i>Cooking and working<br />and sleeping in teams.</i>
6204280 6205950 Hang on a second.
6225720 6227220 It's under control, sir.
6230480 6232020 Where's Tyler?
6232100 6234900 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not...
6234980 6237150 Right. Okay.
6239490 6240990 <i>I'm all alone.</i>
6241570 6244950 <i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>
6245530 6247530 <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>
6252120 6255670 <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem<br />only Tyler knows.</i>
6256500 6259500 <i>The second rule is<br />you do not ask questions.</i>
6262630 6265550 Get the fuck away from me!<br />Get the fuck away from me!
6266390 6268390 Who are all these people?
6273100 6275350 The Paper Street Soap Company.
6277900 6279400 Can I come in?
6282690 6284200 He's not here.
6284990 6286070 What?
6287700 6290450 Tyler isn't here.
6291700 6293700 Tyler went away.
6293790 6295250 Tyler's gone.
6311680 6313470 Jesus! Get some help!
6326410 6330030 Two gunshot wounds coming through!<br />Make some fucking room!
6330450 6332490 What happened? What happened?
6332580 6333870 We were on assignment.
6333950 6337040 We were supposed to kill<br />two birds with one stone.
6337210 6339710 Destroy a piece of corporate art...
6339790 6342250 Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
6343760 6346260 ...and trash a franchise coffee bar.
6352260 6354770 We had it all worked out, sir.
6362650 6365990 - It went smooth until...<br />- Police! Freeze!
6366070 6368860 - What?<br />- They shot Bob.
6370450 6373280 - They shot him in the head.<br />- Fucking pigs!
6378210 6379870 Oh, God!
6379960 6383790 - Those motherfuckers!<br />- You morons.
6384300 6387260 You run around in ski masks<br />trying to blow things up?
6387340 6389880 What did you think was gonna happen?
6393140 6396770 Okay, quick! We gotta get rid of the<br />evidence. We gotta get rid of his body!
6396850 6398890 - Bury him.<br />- What?
6399100 6401650 Take him to the garden and bury him.
6402400 6406610 - Come on, people, let's go!<br />- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
6406690 6408070 What are you talking about?
6408150 6410990 This isn't fucking piece of evidence.<br />This is a person.
6411160 6414200 He's a friend of mine and you're not<br />gonna bury him in the fucking garden!
6414280 6416990 He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
6417080 6419910 - This is Bob.<br />- But, sir, in...
6420000 6422250 In Project Mayhem, we have no names.
6422330 6423670 Now, you listen to me.
6423750 6428260 This is a man and he has a name,<br />and it's Robert Paulsen, okay?
6428340 6429420 Robert Paulsen?
6429510 6431840 He's a man,<br />and he's dead now because of us.
6431930 6433760 All right? Do you understand that?
6434850 6436350 I understand.
6438600 6442980 In death, a member of Project Mayhem<br />has a name.
6444820 6446900 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6447690 6449820 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6450450 6453320 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6454280 6456870 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6457040 6460250 - Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.<br />- His name is Robert Paulsen.
6460532 6463055 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6463119 6465822 - His name is Robert Paulsen.<br />- Shut up! This is all over with!
6465869 6467728 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6467814 6470306 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6470385 6472830 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6472877 6475299 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6475330 6477361 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6501080 6502120 Tyler?
6502210 6504710 No, this is Detective Stern<br />of the Arson Unit.
6504920 6506420 <i>I need to see you in my office...</i>
6511010 6515130 <i>I went to all the cities<br />on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>
6515840 6517180 <i>I didn't know how, of why</i>
6517260 6520350 <i>but I could look at 50 different bars,<br />and somehow I just knew.</i>
6520430 6524980 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.<br />It's very important that I talk to him.
6525060 6527020 I wish I could help you,
6527230 6528270 sir.
6534610 6536450 <i>Every city I went to,</i>
6537620 6540080 <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>
6540160 6542410 <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>
6543160 6544210 Hey! Hey!
6545460 6546620 Taxi!
6546790 6548250 Look at my face. I'm a member.
6548340 6551550 Now, I just need to know<br />if you've seen Tyler.
6551630 6555260 I'm not exposed to bespeak<br />any such information to you,
6555340 6559680 nor would I, even if I had said information<br />you want at this juncture, be able.
6561810 6564310 - You're a moron.<br />- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
6565980 6571070 <i>Tyler had been busy,<br />setting up franchises all over the country.</i>
6573860 6577150 <i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>
6578280 6580990 <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>
6581990 6584370 - We've just heard the stories.<br />- What kind of stories?
6584450 6589040 - Nobody knows what he looks like.<br />- He has facial reconstructive surgery every three years.
6589580 6591710 That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
6591800 6596170 - Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?<br />- Is Mr. Durden building an army?
6597010 6600140 <i>I was living in a state<br />of perpetual déjà vu.</i>
6601010 6604180 <i>Everywhere I went,<br />I felt I'd already been there.</i>
6604930 6607640 <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>
6608850 6610980 <i>The smell of dried blood.</i>
6612020 6614980 <i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>
6615070 6617990 <i>That aroma of old sweat,<br />like fried chicken.</i>
6618700 6622990 <i>The feel of a floor still warm<br />from a fight the night before.</i>
6623080 6625830 <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>
6628790 6634040 His name is Robert Paulsen.<br />His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
6636880 6638550 Welcome back, sir.
6640010 6641680 How have you been?
6642800 6644350 Do you know me?
6644890 6647890 - Is this a test, sir?<br />- No. This is not a test.
6649560 6651850 You were in here last Thursday.
6652400 6653650 Thursday?
6654190 6658360 You were standing where you are now,<br />asking how good security is.
6658900 6660950 It's tight as a drum, sir.
6663070 6664950 Who do you think I am?
6665740 6669410 - Are you sure this isn't a test?<br />- No, this is not a test.
6671000 6672630 You're Mr. Durden.
6673590 6675920 You're the one who gave me this.
6677010 6680720 <i>Please return your seat backs<br />to their full upright and locked position.</i>
6692520 6694020 - Yeah?<br /><i>- Marla, it's me.</i>
6694110 6696230 - Have we ever done it?<br /><i>- Done what?</i>
6696320 6699400 - Have we ever had sex.<br />- What kind of stupid question is that?
6699490 6702660 Stupid because the answer's yes<br />or because the answer's no?
6702740 6704740 - Is this a trick?<br /><i>- No, Marla. I need to know...</i>
6704820 6709330 You wanna know if I think<br />we were just having sex or making love?
6709410 6712040 - We did make love?<br /><i>- Is that what you're calling it?</i>
6712290 6715540 Just answer the question, Marla, please!<br />Did we do it or not?
6715630 6718380 You fuck me, then snub me.<br />You love me, you hate me.
6718460 6721050 You show me a sensitive side,<br />then you turn into a total asshole.
6721130 6723800 Is that a pretty accurate description<br />of our relationship, Tyler?
6724470 6726550 <i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>
6726720 6728510 - What did you just say?<br />- What is wrong with you?
6728600 6731060 - What did you just call me? Say my name!<br />- Tyler Durden.
6731140 6733730 Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!<br />What's going on?
6733810 6735850 - I'm coming over!<br />- No, wait, Marla, I'm not there!
6737940 6739980 You broke your promise.
6740070 6742360 - Jesus, Tyler.<br />- You fucking talked to her about me.
6742450 6747620 - Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?<br />- I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.
6747700 6750120 Why do people think that I'm you?
6750700 6752040 Answer me!
6756170 6757250 Sit.
6760550 6763550 Answer me. Why do people<br />think that I'm you?
6763840 6765590 I think you know.
6765680 6767760 - No, I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6767850 6770890 Why would anyone<br />possibly confuse you with me?
6772310 6773980 I... I don't know.
6778520 6780360 - You got it.<br />- No.
6780610 6783360 - Do not fuck with us!<br />- Say it.
6784900 6786240 Because...
6788030 6789240 Say it!
6791240 6793540 Because we're the same person.
6793790 6794870 That's right.
6794960 6797540 <i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing...</i>
6797630 6801340 - I don't understand this.<br />- You were looking for a way to change your life.
6801420 6803630 You could not do this on your own.
6803720 6806970 All the ways you wish you could be,<br />that's me.
6808140 6810430 I look like you wanna look,<br />fuck like you wanna fuck,
6810510 6815680 I am smart, capable and, most importantly,<br />I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
6815980 6817020 Oh, no.
6817100 6820270 - Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. Tyler's gone.<br />- What?
6820360 6824610 - This isn't possible. This is crazy.<br />- People do it every day.
6824860 6828660 They talk to themselves.<br />They see themselves as they'd like to be.
6828740 6832790 They don't have the courage you have<br />to just run with it.
6835120 6838750 Naturally, you're still wrestling with it,<br />so sometimes you're still you.
6838830 6840380 We should do this again sometime.
6840750 6843000 Other times,<br />you imagine yourself watching me.
6843090 6845960 If this is your first<br />time, you have to fight.
6846050 6849720 Little by little,<br />you're just letting yourself become...
6852055 6852850 Tyler Durden.
6852930 6856480 You are not your job<br />or how much money you have in the bank!
6856890 6858600 - No. You have a house.<br />- Rented in your name.
6858690 6862270 - You have jobs, you have a whole life.<br />- You have night jobs because you can't sleep.
6862440 6866280 - Or you stay up and make soap.<br />- Marla- you're fucking Marla, Tyler.
6866360 6869242 Technically, you're fucking Marla.<br />But it's all the same to her.
6871570 6873120 Oh, my God.
6873950 6876040 Now you see our dilemma.
6876620 6878500 She knows too much.
6879420 6882630 I think we're gonna have to talk about<br />how this might compromise our goals.
6884800 6887010 What... What are you saying?
6887130 6891140 This is... This is bullshit. This is bullshit!<br />I'm not listening to this.
6891220 6894220 - You are insane!<br />- No. You're insane.
6894310 6897470 And we simply<br />do not have time for this crap.
6899190 6901100 <i>It's called a changeover.</i>
6901190 6905230 <i>The movie goes on,<br />and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>
6919000 6922620 - Sir! Are you checking out?<br />- Yeah. Bill me.
6922710 6926170 I need you to initial<br />this list of phone calls, please.
6929670 6933390 - When were these made?<br />- It says right there, sir. Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
6938850 6941190 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier<br />every night?</i>
6941270 6943440 <i>Have I been sleeping later?</i>
6945020 6947940 <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>
6951700 6953280 Is anybody here?
6955700 6958200 <i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>
6959370 6962410 Yeah, with enough soap,<br />one could blow up just about anything.
6965170 6966630 Oh, my God.
6970380 6972380 <i>- 1888.</i><br />- Who am I calling?
6972800 6975050 <i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance.</i>
6976600 6979180 <i>Hello? Hello?</i>
6979270 6980890 Franklin Street?
6982060 6984020 <i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>
6986610 6989190 <i>- Hello?</i><br />- Yeah, yeah.
6989730 6991900 I need to talk to your supervisor<br />right away.
6991990 6993950 <i>- Speaking.</i><br />- Okay, listen to me.
6994030 6997120 I think something really terrible<br />is about to happen to your building.
6997200 6999160 <i>It's under control, sir.</i>
6999870 7003330 - Excuse me?<br /><i>- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>
7007340 7008420 <i>2160.</i>
7016850 7019430 Marla! Marla! Hey, Marla, wait!
7020755 7023890 Marla, wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7023980 7026520 Your whacked-out bald freaks<br />hit me with a fucking broom!
7026600 7028310 They almost broke my arm!
7028400 7030120 They were burning<br />their fingertips with lye.
7030150 7032009 - The stink was unbelievable.<br />- Look- Look, listen to me.
7032030 7034820 it'll take a tremendous act of faith on your part,<br />but you gotta hear me out.
7034900 7038620 - Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />- A little more faith than that.
7043000 7044830 Listen, I don't wanna hear<br />anything you have to say.
7044910 7047670 You have every right to be...
7047750 7049330 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7049420 7051920 Sir, anything you order<br />is free of charge, sir.
7053130 7055800 - Why is it free of charge?<br />- Don't- Don't ask.
7056010 7057260 Whatever.
7057340 7058800 I'll have the clam chowder,
7058890 7062220 fried chicken with a baked potato with<br />everything and chocolate chiffon pie.
7062310 7064390 Clean food, please.
7064480 7067060 In that case, sir, may I advise against<br />the lady eating the clam chowder?
7067150 7069270 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7071900 7073900 You got about 30 seconds.
7075530 7078740 I know I've been acting<br />very very strange, okay?
7079070 7081580 I know that it's gotta seem<br />like there's two sides to me...
7081660 7083740 Two sides?<br />You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
7083830 7087494 I deserved that. But I've come to<br />realise something very very important.
7087548 7088460 What?
7088540 7091790 The full extent of our relationship<br />wasn't really clear to me up until now,
7091880 7093920 for reasons I'm not gonna go into,<br />but the important thing is-
7094010 7096420 - I know that I haven't been treating you so nice.<br />- Whatever.
7096510 7100930 No, no. 15 seconds, 15 seconds please!<br />Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
7101470 7103600 I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry.
7103680 7107350 Because what I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7109520 7111310 - You do?<br />- I really do.
7112070 7116490 I care about you and I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7116570 7119200 Marla, your life is in danger.
7121030 7123870 - What?<br />- You need to leave town for a while.
7123990 7126290 Get out of any major city.<br />And just go camping...
7126370 7128080 You're an insane person.
7128160 7131920 - No, no, I've involved you in something terrible that's about to happen.<br />- No. Shut up!
7132000 7134090 - You're not safe.<br />- Shut up!
7136550 7140720 - Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />- I know you did.
7140890 7146060 There are things about you I like. You're<br />smart, you're funny, you're spectacular in bed.
7146720 7149310 But... you're intolerable.
7149980 7153810 You have very serious emotional problems,<br />deep-seeded problems
7153900 7155820 for which you should seek<br />professional help.
7155900 7160070 - I know, and I'm sorry.<br />- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry, but...
7161450 7163450 I can't do this anymore.
7164280 7166740 I can't. I won't.
7168620 7169910 I'm gone.
7170870 7173080 You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7176710 7178420 - Marla, wait you don't understand!<br />- Leave me alone!
7178510 7180720 I am trying to protect you!
7180930 7184090 - I don't ever want to see you again!<br />- That's fine, if that's what it takes...
7184470 7186220 Wait right here.
7190640 7192600 Hold it right there! Shut up! Shut up!
7193230 7197862 Take this money and get on this bus. And I promise you<br />I will never bother you again if that's what you want.
7197940 7199230 Shut up!
7199320 7202280 Please get on the bus.<br />Please get on the bus.
7203820 7206660 - Why are you doing this?<br />- 'Cause they think you're some kind of a threat.
7206740 7208870 I can't explain it right now. Just trust me.
7208950 7210870 If I see where you're going,<br />you'll not be safe.
7210960 7213580 I'm not paying this back.<br />I consider it asshole tax.
7213670 7217460 That's fine. Remember, stay out of major cities<br />for at least a couple of days, okay?
7217550 7218800 Tyler...
7220300 7222550 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7237520 7240030 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7240690 7242940 I am the leader of a terrorist organization
7243030 7247530 responsible for numerous acts of vandalism<br />and assault all over this city.
7248192 7251652 In the metropolitan area, we had<br />probably a couple hundred members.
7252080 7256080 Chapters have sprung up<br />in five or six other major cities already.
7256170 7259380 This is a tightly regimented organization
7259460 7264010 with many cells capable of operating<br />completely independent of central leadership.
7265010 7268850 Go to the house, okay? 1537 Paper Street.
7269470 7271100 That's our headquarters.
7271180 7276020 In the back, buried in the garden,<br />you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7277360 7279690 In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs
7279770 7284360 that have been used very recently<br />to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7285610 7288450 I believe the plan is<br />to blow up the headquarters
7288530 7290370 of these credit-card companies
7290450 7292240 and the TRW building.
7294000 7297370 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit-card companies?
7297750 7301170 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7302050 7304130 You'll create total chaos.
7306680 7309680 Keep him talking.<br />I need to make a phone call.
7319810 7322230 I really admire what you're doing.
7323400 7326110 - What?<br />- You're a brave man to order this.
7327070 7328860 You're a genius, sir.
7328950 7332950 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7334080 7335620 we gotta get his balls.
7336750 7340210 - It's useless to fight.<br />- It's really a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
7340290 7343460 - It'll set quite an example.<br />- You're making a big mistake fellas!
7343550 7345760 - You said you'd say that.<br />- I'm not Tyler Durden!
7345840 7348130 You told us you'd say that too.
7348680 7350680 All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7350760 7355390 Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct<br />order. We're aborting this mission right now.
7355470 7358190 You said you would definitely say that.
7359980 7361520 Let me go!
7362770 7366440 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7368240 7369700 Is somebody timing this?
7369780 7372584 Keep your mouth shut.
7372870 7373950 Shit!
7377620 7380620 - Hey, you know, some of this information checks out.<br />- Uh-huh?
7381000 7383880 - Let's go over to that house on Paper Street.<br />- Be right there.
7385210 7386300 Hey, wait!
7386460 7387710 - You got him?<br />- I got him.
7387800 7389420 Sir, we have to do this.
7389510 7392260 - Stop fighting!<br />- Where's the rubber band?
7392350 7395350 Get away from me!<br />Drop that fucking knife! Drop it!
7398390 7401940 Back up. Face down on the<br />floor, both of you, right now!
7404070 7405940 Get down on the floor!
7410490 7414570 First person that comes out this door<br />gets a lead salad! You understand?
7439430 7441350 Get away! Stay away!
7454490 7455660 <i>I ran.</i>
7457160 7461040 <i>I ran until my muscles burned<br />and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>
7463790 7465830 <i>Then I ran some more.</i>
7507380 7510380 What the fuck are you doing,<br />running around in your underpants?
7510460 7512260 Man, you look like a crazy person.
7512340 7515340 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7515430 7520220 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. it'll be like pay-per-view.
7569259 7570190 Oh, Christ.
7570270 7572110 Now what are you doing?
7572190 7574280 - I'm stopping this.<br />- Why?
7574820 7578610 - The greatest thing you've ever done, man.<br />- No, I can't let this happen.
7578700 7580820 You know there are 10 other bombs<br />in 10 other buildings.
7581191 7583540 Goddamn it! Since when is Project Mayhem<br />about murder?
7583620 7586979 The buildings are empty. Security,<br />maintenance, all our people.
7586981 7588871 We're not killing anyone, man.<br />We're setting them free!
7588960 7591750 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7592380 7594460 You wanna make an omelet,<br />you gotta break some eggs.
7594550 7597840 No. I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7605220 7609140 Wouldn't do that.<br />Not unless I knew which wires were what.
7609230 7611190 If you know, then I know.
7616530 7621360 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.
7629750 7631080 You think?
7632420 7634960 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7635050 7637510 Pull any one but the green one.
7642600 7645050 I asked you not to do that!
7647390 7648560 Fuck!
7649850 7652060 Tyler, get away from the van.
7654060 7657070 Tyler, I'm not kidding!<br />Get away from the van!
7657990 7659360 Goddamn it!
7666040 7667290 Okay.
7667370 7670500 You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend
7670580 7673250 near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
7675590 7677670 Cool it, Tyler! Tyler!
7690640 7693350 Aw, come on! Don't go!
7732480 7733560 What?
7779190 7782730 Three minutes. This is it.
7783070 7785190 The beginning.
7785280 7786740 Ground zero.
7786820 7791450 <i>- I think this is about where we came in.</i><br />- Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
7794120 7795250 I'm sorry?
7795330 7797710 I still can't think of anything.
7799040 7800960 Ah. Flashback humour.
7806800 7809010 It's getting exciting now.
7810390 7813890 Two and a half. Think of everything<br />we've accomplished, man.
7815810 7819900 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7820060 7823020 One step closer to economic equilibrium.
7837830 7840540 - Why is she here?<br />- Tying up loose ends.
7841290 7844090 Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
7844800 7849180 - I'm begging you, please don't do this.<br />- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
7849260 7852260 - This is what we want.<br />- No. I don't want this.
7852430 7857180 Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.<br />We have to forget about you.
7858100 7861020 - You're a voice in my head.<br />- You're a voice in mine!
7861110 7864690 - You're a fucking hallucination. Why can't I get rid of you?<br />- You need me.
7864780 7867110 No. I don't. I really don't anymore.
7867190 7871280 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make myself feel better.
7871490 7873870 - Take some responsibility.<br />- I do.
7873950 7877450 I am responsible for all of it,<br />and I accept that.
7877540 7881120 So, please, I'm begging you,<br />please call this off.
7883630 7885590 Have I ever let us down?
7887260 7889970 How far have you come because of me?
7895430 7897520 I will bring us through this.
7897600 7901440 As always, I will carry you<br />kicking and screaming,
7901560 7904020 and in the end you will thank me.
7904270 7906770 Tyler. Tyler.
7906900 7910780 I'm grateful to you<br />for everything that you've done for me.
7910860 7913280 But this is too much. I don't want this.
7913370 7918160 What do you want? You wanna go back to the shit job?<br />Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
7918250 7920290 Fuck you! I won't do it.
7921290 7925130 - This can't be happening.<br />- It's already done, so shut up!
7925710 7929210 - 60 seconds till CRI.<br />- No.
7930920 7933930 I can figure this out. I can figure this out.<br />This isn't even real.
7934260 7938100 You're not real. That gun isn't...<br />That gun isn't even in your hand.
7939270 7941060 The gun's in my hand.
7947190 7949980 Hey, good for you. Doesn't change a thing.
7958200 7961000 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
7961660 7963580 Not my head, Tyler.
7963870 7965290 Our head.
7967420 7968840 Interesting.
7972300 7975220 Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
7981270 7984020 Hey. It's you and me.
7987980 7989320 Friends?
7990730 7992070 Tyler,
7995450 7998030 I want you to really listen to me.
7998700 7999740 Okay.
8001750 8003580 My eyes are open.
8021140 8022850 What's that smell?
8043580 8046910 - Where is everybody?<br />- Oh, no. What's going on?
8047420 8048920 Mr. Durden!
8049290 8050790 Oh, my God!
8051800 8052840 Sir!
8056300 8059470 Are you... Are you all right, sir?
8059890 8063600 - Oh, yeah, I'm okay.<br />- You look terrible, sir. What happened?
8063930 8067600 - Oh, nothing, it's no problem.<br />- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
8067690 8071310 - You look really awful. You need medical assistance.<br />- I'm fine.
8071820 8074280 Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
8076360 8079240 Ow! Stop it!
8079320 8081780 - Let, let her go.<br />- Christ Almighty!
8082660 8083870 You!
8084660 8086000 Hi, Marla.
8087500 8091460 - Leave her with me. Get your stuff. Meet me downstairs.<br />- Are you sure?
8091670 8093340 Yes, I'm sure.
8095170 8099340 You fucker! What kind of sick fucking game<br />are you playing at, putting me on a fucking bu...
8099430 8101800 Oh, my God, your face!
8101890 8103390 Yeah, I know.
8108850 8111060 - What happened?<br />- Don't ask.
8111150 8113110 - You're shot.<br />- Yes, I'm shot.
8113190 8115020 Oh, my God.
8115150 8118490 - I can't believe he's standing.<br />- Tough motherfucker.
8122660 8124200 Who did this?
8124740 8126370 I did, actually.
8127080 8128790 Find some gauze.
8130420 8134710 - You shot yourself?<br />- Yes, but it's okay. Marla, look at me.
8134800 8136300 I'm really okay.
8137800 8140800 Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
8154150 8156730 You met me at<br />a very strange time in my life.
