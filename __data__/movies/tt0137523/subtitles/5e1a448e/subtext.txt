3128 7292 On this track you will hear<br />commentary by David Fincher, Brad Pitt,
7382 10090 Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.
39623 43742 Is it true that you had<br />to present this title sequence
43835 46327 as a separate budget<br />from the rest of the film?
46421 49834 Yeah.<br />To keep you on budget, they say:
49925 55637 "We'll think about doing<br />a title sequence if you're good."
55722 60307 "If the movie's good, you can<br />rise up from the brain. If it's bad..."
60394 63477 It's white titles against black.
63564 66727 When I first got to LA,<br />before we started shooting,
66817 70731 about a week before - no, two weeks,<br />we had two weeks' rehearsal -
70821 74439 and as an introduction into<br />the mind of this film, literally,
74533 76490 he showed me this opening shot,
76577 82072 which the computer-generating geniuses<br />were working on.
82165 85328 He tried to explain<br />the sort of tracking shot,
85419 87501 starting in the motor neurons of the brain,
87588 91502 and tracking out until eventually<br />you get to the barrel of the gun,
91592 93253 which you'll see in a second.
93343 96381 Anyway, it was sort of mind-blowing,
96471 99759 and it did indicate to me<br />that this person had an intense,
99850 102808 amazing visual imagination.
102894 109311 It was a glimpse into the mind<br />and visual imagination of Fincher.
110235 115446 Then I sort of knew that I could trust him<br />and I was in good hands.
115532 120948 That was the case with most of the film,<br />in that he has such a specific vision, David,
121038 124451 that I knew I could relax<br />because he'd do half the work for me,
124541 127875 ie, in the composition of shots<br />or the way he saw the character.
128503 129459 Added to which, he thought he was Marla,
129546 132709 so I thought all I needed to do<br />was copy him.
133508 137797 I'm not completely joking<br />about him thinking he was Marla!
138889 142598 Certainly he got the tone of her,<br />or understood the tone of her.
142684 147975 So I did, I would say,<br />partially base the character on David.
148065 150807 <i>-</i> It's a little dark, Fincher.<br />-Sorry.
150901 155395 I have a philosophy that in most movies<br />you can see too much of the actors' eyes,
155489 158481 so we tried to really<br />get rid of that in this movie.
158575 163320 -That's bold.<br />-The Gordon Willis approach.
163413 166075 I don't remember doing this shot.
166958 168414 How did you<br />drop the camera like that?
168502 171210 How did you go through the bullet hole?
171296 174163 As you go through<br />the van and whip along
174257 175839 in the foundation of the building,
175926 178088 if you go frame by frame<br />you'll see the rooms.
178178 181716 There's one room,<br />there's a janitor's office.
181807 183514 You'll see the intricate work<br />done by people
183600 187685 who have never left offices like that,
187771 190388 where they live in front<br />of their computers.
190482 195977 That's the enduring image of the movie<br />to me - my face in Bob's chest.
200325 204785 Meat Loaf gave me a picture<br />of me against his breasts
204871 208535 in a frame that said<br />"With hugs. Love, Meat."
212462 216547 I'm taller than Meat Loaf, so he had<br />these enormous elevator lift shoes on
216633 220251 that gave him about an extra eight inches.
220345 222211 When Meat came in,
222305 225673 I didn't really recognize him cos his hair<br />was all cut short already
225767 228555 from another movie.
228645 232354 He came in and it was kind of hard<br />to believe it was him.
232441 234523 He was great from the first reading.
235861 238728 He was really, really great. Really funny.
241742 245406 Starbucks was cool<br />with this, letting us do all that stuff,
245495 247156 except have a Starbucks.
247247 250831 If I'm not mistaken...<br />There was our first little blip.
250917 254626 -Subliminal <i>Brad</i> number one.<br />-One frame.
254713 260584 These were the first week of shooting,<br />by the way, these office scenes.
260677 265296 Brad was still on vacation.<br />I was working, though.
265974 269217 -Zach Grenier.<br />-Zach! Whoo!
272063 277934 <i>You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?</i>
278028 281441 It's so funny,<br />that business vernacular.
281531 286150 Everyone seems to know<br />what they're talking about.
287996 290454 This is brave.<br />You don't see many movies
290540 293828 where guys have their pants<br />round their ankles.
293919 297833 I didn't have anything on<br />underneath, either.
297923 304511 -I wasn't wearing, like...<br /><i>-</i> A thong. Not for this scene.
304596 310842 In fact, did you notice that I didn't<br />ask to go to the bathroom the whole day?
313897 318141 Fincher, do you remember when we did<br />this shot? We watched it on the tape.
318235 320146 You said,<br />"You have to come in very precisely
320237 323195 "and you have to be at a perfect pace."
323281 326819 We watched it on the monitor<br />and... and someone said:
326910 329572 "Norton resembles a young Baryshnikov."
331498 334581 I don't remember that.
341925 345088 It was a challenge<br />doing the early part of this movie -
345178 349046 really, all through the movie<br />cos the voice-over goes all through it -
349140 352883 often we were shooting shots<br />knowing that the voice-over was running
352978 359145 and you have to time the synch<br />of the voice-over... fairly closely,
359234 364695 especially like that, where a voice-over line<br />comes in between two lines in the scene.
364781 369196 Sometimes we had Dina Waxman,<br />our script supervisor, sitting offstage
369286 374452 quietly reading the voice-over lines<br />in the spaces where they were going to be
374541 379502 so that we would do the timing<br />of the actual lines right.
379588 381579 Subliminal. Dink.
381965 386710 I loved using a subliminal advertising<br />technique to introduce a character.
386803 390717 When we were doing<br />the transfer of the film...
390807 395392 As we finish the reels they send them<br />to be quality-checked, quality-controlled,
395478 400518 and we did get notes back that there<br />was some dirt on some of the frames.
400609 406821 Big discussions about this section,<br />about... the balance of humor and reality,
406907 411868 and we're dealing with something<br />that there are people walking around with
411953 414911 and living with and dealing with,
414998 421370 and finding that line of empathy<br />and still finding the irony within.
425133 427966 This is the kind of scene<br />that, I don't know,
428053 433844 only people with no sense of humor<br />saw as negative.
438229 443019 Here's one of the first clues<br />of who Tyler really is.
444027 449864 He repeats these words right here, "I look<br />around this room and I see a lot of men..."
449950 453659 A lot of this was shot<br />downtown in Los Angeles,
453745 456954 spaces that don't look like<br />anyplace in particular.
457040 461625 I think the idea was to have a city<br />that's everywhere and nowhere.
463254 467418 Meat Loaf had just spent a decade<br />losing all this weight,
467509 470797 and he gets a job<br />where he's gotta be a fat guy again.
470887 473504 So they have to build this fat suit for him.
473598 479810 And you know there were two suits made,<br />because of the studio.
479896 484561 One with nipples, one sans nipples.
484651 486892 The first week of shooting,
486987 491527 the only response we got from the studio<br />about things that they liked or didn't like,
491616 494324 they sent us a memo saying:
494411 500532 "Is it necessary that he have<br />these giant, dustbin-lid nipples?"
500625 503868 I was driving down Beverly<br />and I looked over
503962 509799 and there was this homeless woman<br />asleep in a bus shelter,
509884 512251 and she had giant nipples poking through.
512345 515804 I was, like, "I gotta get a picture of her<br />and send it to Laura."
515890 520259 You should have quoted Larry<br />Flynt, "Complain to the manufacturer."
520353 526599 Looking at this shot, I did<br />a shot once with Meat Loaf that wasn't in.
526693 530027 It was a shame cos I had to cry,<br />and you always think
530113 534277 when you summon up tears and it's not in,<br />"Shame. After all that effort."
534367 536233 We reshot it twice,
536327 541367 but I think it was more to do with that<br />it didn't suit the introduction of Maria.
541458 545122 Much as I liked nestling<br />into Meat Loaf's breasts.
545211 548124 I felt pretty bonded<br />to Brad and Fincher,
548214 554301 just in terms of that it was in essence<br />a comedy, or a black comedy,
554387 557721 with a heavy element of satire in it.
557807 562222 These kind of scenes, the support-group<br />scenes, are emblematic of that,
562312 566556 cos if you didn't approach these<br />with a tongue-in-cheek black comedy,
566649 569186 then you'd be missing the point.
569277 573566 Definitely, if it was not for Marla,<br />Tyler would not be engendered,
573656 578696 and the need to invent Tyler comes from<br />meeting Marla, or in confronting Marla,
578787 582405 somebody he could possibly<br />have a relationship with.
582499 584831 He's too scared and retreats
584918 587660 and invents this character that he feels
587754 590587 could have a relationship<br />rather than himself.
590673 595839 That's when they were saying,<br />"Thank you, Travis." Which was...
595929 598136 <i>-</i> An ode to Travis Bickle.<br />-Right.
598223 602933 There was a period where I was gonna<br />have all of the fake names that he uses
603019 605977 be names from De Niro characters<br />in the 708.
606439 609022 Prior <i>to</i> that <i>it was</i><br />from <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>
609109 613319 -I had Travis and Rupert.<br />-You had Cornelius in there.
613404 615941 But then Cornelius got in,
616032 619115 and then when we ended up<br />in the sickle-cell anemia group,
619202 621364 Luther got in, remember?
622247 625956 So it ended up sort of a mélange between
626042 630206 De Niro performances of the 703<br />and <i>Planet</i> of the Apes.
631506 636125 I think it's a great sort of<br />end-of-the-century character,
636219 640964 a guy who's addicted to self-help groups<br />and support groups.
641057 644300 Christina, the girl playing<br />the support-group leader,
644394 645930 doing the guided meditation,
646020 649558 is an old friend of mine<br />from New York theater days.
649649 652858 She and I were in a lot of plays<br />in New York together.
652944 656312 The first time<br />we met with the Dust Brothers,
656406 660320 I basically said, "This is what<br />we want to do and here's the script,"
660410 662447 and they were just, like, "Cool."
662537 666155 They offered nothing back,<br />cos they were just...
666249 667580 Stoned.
670753 674667 Everybody was terrified cos<br />they had done nothing before. I was, like:
674757 676464 "That's exactly what we want."
676551 679839 "We cannot have somebody do<br />the music who's done it before
679929 684298 "because it will freak them out, trying<br />to thematically tie this all together."
684392 687851 Yeah, it was fantastic.<br />We were pushing for Radiohead,
687937 692682 for that early Simon and Garfunkel<br /><i>Graduate</i> feel.
692775 694686 Brad and I had a mutual fixation
695445 699188 on the second two Radiohead albums.
699282 703150 You can't really go wrong<br />with an entrance like this.
703244 705576 A girl walking into<br />a testicular cancer support group
705663 708701 and asking whether it's cancer.
708791 712204 Watching it, you remember little things.
712295 718166 I tried to do an American accent, so I tried<br />to get the nasal a in "cancer" right.
718259 721342 When doing an accent, which I enjoy doing,
721429 725718 certain sentences represent<br />little verbal hurdles.
725808 730518 The most outstanding things<br />from going English to American
730605 734269 are the ds for ts you substitute,<br />or ts for ds.
734359 739604 And the nasal as and the rs<br />are particularly pronounced.
739697 742610 "So this is cancer, right?"
742700 745533 One of the foremost characteristics<br />of working with David is
745620 747236 he does multiple takes,
747330 750573 so you never walk away<br />thinking you haven't got it.
750667 753250 I thought the amount of smoking<br />she was gonna have to do
753336 755919 might cure Helena,
756005 759248 but she went from two packs a day<br />to three.
759342 762334 Another enjoyable thing<br />for me was being a smoker
762428 765045 and being paid to smoke.
765139 767756 Do you know<br />what I was doing below the frame?
767850 770592 We shot a version<br />where Ed was masturbating
770687 773770 as he's thinking about<br />how much he hates Marla.
773856 777269 And she's making him<br />incapable of even that.
777360 779567 He's incapable of even<br />that level of self-love.
785868 789782 This is practically<br />the only other woman in the film, Chloe,
789872 792785 and the support group leader.
792875 796288 I felt immense solidarity<br />when they came on set.
796379 800998 In the book, it's Joni Mitchell's<br />skeleton, not Meryl Streep's.
801092 806587 -Why did we change it from Joni Mitchell?<br /><i>-</i> She looks more like Meryl Streep.
806681 810140 I just didn't think she looked<br />enough like Joni Mitchell.
810226 812809 -An easy answer.<br />-Yeah.
813896 818641 Rachel Singer, by the way,<br />is a wonderful actress who came in and...
818735 821193 There was a huge discrepancy in...
821279 827321 I think Art Linson was the first one who<br />thought she was just too sad. It was too...
827410 829993 It wasn't funny enough.
830079 834789 Art wanted to see somebody funny<br />deliver the lines that Chloe delivers.
834876 837959 We were pushing for that too,<br />at that time.
838046 841038 -I love her.<br />-She did a great job.
841132 844750 And it just seems so tragic.
846929 850923 I don't know why this shit<br />pisses me off so much.
851017 854555 These practices are meant to distract...
854645 858730 Giving people false hope,<br />that's what pisses me off.
858816 862309 But then again,<br />I don't have any better answers, so...
862403 866317 That was one of my favorite<br />Andy Kevin Walker lines:
866407 869616 "If I had a tumor, I'd name it Marla."
869702 871909 When we started rehearsing,
871996 876285 the question was whether to visit<br />real support groups for the terminally ill,
876376 881416 or generally any kind of support group<br />for real, but we realized it was wrong.
881506 884498 Only because, ultimately, it's satirical
884592 889382 and it's not a totally realistic portrayal,
889472 892339 and it doesn't mean to be.
892433 895221 It would have been<br />the wrong frame of reference.
895311 901148 Everything about this film is<br />on a stylized, heightened realm.
901234 905899 I love this little sight gag<br />of her overflowing the coffee.
905988 907854 <i>-</i> Did she do it?<br />-Yeah. Watch.
909409 911616 I never saw that.
911702 915036 I was, like,<br />"Make sure the coffee overflows."
915123 918832 That's how focused I was<br />in the moment, I never noticed.
918918 921080 You are good!
922171 927541 And Helena walks a fine line.<br />She... is tasty.
927635 930593 Her role was a role that could have...
930680 936175 It read a little more redundant than mine<br />and Edward's, a little more monotone,
936269 939978 and she didn't get<br />the credit she deserved here.
940857 945397 Little delicate turns and twists really<br />filled the thing in. She's phenomenal.
945486 948228 Helena's got such big cheekbones,
948322 951360 it looks like her cheeks touch<br />in the middle of her mouth.
951451 953783 One thing<br />I hated about Helena's hair
953870 955531 was these strands came into her eyes,
955621 959455 and they were so distracting<br />cos she has amazing eyes.
959542 963501 But it became this tension thing<br />because they were always dangling.
963588 966501 She blinks and they move.
966591 973133 -I love the couple in the back there.<br />-Yeah. A little overacting. Always.
973222 976135 -With matching skin heads.<br />-Yeah.
976225 979138 -I like her coke ring.<br />-They're good.
979228 981765 Her little flower ring for hiding...
981856 985474 In the Fight Club catalog,<br />that was the most hilarious one.
985568 988151 That was my<br />favorite marketing tool.
988237 992856 The Fight Club catalog?<br />It was genius. I'm holding on to mine.
992950 995783 One costume decision<br />made early on,
995870 999989 principally because David said to<br />Michael Kaplan, the costume designer:
1000082 1001993 "When she gets here make her taller."
1002084 1005418 The guys are about six foot<br />and I'm about five foot three.
1005505 1008873 I'm approaching a dwarf.
1009425 1014761 So I wore these platforms, which I love,<br />because anything to help lengthen the leg,
1014847 1018556 but was fast regretting it<br />after doing about a marathon
1018643 1022728 walking up and down that street<br />after about 36 takes.
1022813 1029185 So most of the time - it might be a bit<br />disillusioning - I'm thinking about my feet.
1029278 1033067 When you shoot walk-and-talks<br />with Steadicam on the streets,
1033157 1035899 it ends up being a disaster<br />in terms of sound.
1035993 1040612 I don't know who was doing<br />our transfers of our tape every day,
1040706 1041741 but they sounded horrible,
1041832 1043914 so we looped the whole thing.
1044001 1047710 I remember Edward going,<br />"This is crazy. I can't do this."
1047797 1052462 <i>-</i> And this scene too.<br />-We spent at least a day on that scene.
1052552 1054839 Then when we got to the mixing stage,
1054929 1057637 David Parker,<br />who did all the dialog stuff,
1057723 1061091 played it back for me and it sounded<br />amazing, so we went with it.
1061185 1066646 -The production track?<br />-I think the ADR tracks were great,
1066732 1070145 but it was amazing to hear<br />the production and go,
1070236 1073103 "Wow, this is great. Let's go with it."
1076909 1080743 One take when we did that,<br />I thought I'd actually fully stepped
1080830 1084414 on Edward's foot cos his<br />reaction was so realistic.
1084500 1089745 It was going rather well for Edward<br />and I hadn't stepped on his foot at all.
1096554 1099922 What attracted me to the part<br />was that I was amazed that
1100016 1103099 David was so specific about wanting me,
1103185 1105552 and yet there was nothing<br />that I'd done hitherto
1105646 1107978 that would suggest I was right for it.
1108065 1113936 Having said that, as a film watcher myself,<br />the casting that excites me most
1114030 1118069 is seeing people being given the chance<br />to transform themselves.
1118159 1122778 Shooting this scene, she's on<br />the street, she almost got hit by a car.
1122872 1126957 -We shot that twice.<br /><i>-</i> I wasn't there the second time.
1127043 1129626 -Were there stunt guys?<br />-No.
1129712 1135879 Cos the camera was on the street with her.<br />You were on the sidewalk, pussy boy!
1135968 1139302 It's enough that she has the problem
1139388 1142972 of not knowing which way<br />to look when she steps off the curb.
1143059 1144970 We had all these stunt drivers...
1145061 1149680 -Because she's British.<br />-She would step out into traffic,
1149774 1153312 and I would tell her, "Be fearless",<br />and she would step out there.
1153736 1156649 You could hear the clack of the buttons<br />on her coat
1156739 1159527 as it hit these cars as they zipped by.
1168918 1172206 When we shot the car<br />by the side of the road,
1172296 1174833 that was out in Marina del Rey,
1174924 1178667 at the frog conservation area<br />that was supposed to be...
1178761 1180422 That's right.
1182682 1189179 Do you remember this shot? This<br />is Brad's first nonsubliminal appearance.
1189271 1193230 When we were shooting that,<br />they tried to back the moving sidewalk up,
1193317 1198778 and they couldn't stop it and the entire<br />camera unit jammed up against the back.
1198864 1201822 Our camera operator almost got crushed.
1219301 1224887 In that little hotel video,<br />it is Brad on the right in the line of waiters.
1224974 1229514 No one's ever caught that. No one's<br />ever come up to me who's caught that.
1229603 1231219 I wanted to do...
1231313 1233850 You know those infomercials<br />when you check into your room
1233941 1235898 and they show you the fire exits
1235985 1240229 and you see the guy in the elevator and it<br />stops and there's smoke coming through
1240322 1244236 and he puts a towel down at the base,<br />the wet towel?
1244326 1246738 We wanted to do one of those,<br />but we didn't have time.
1246829 1249036 So it was reduced down to that.
1249123 1253583 It's pretty pure.<br />Not even in the middle, off to the side.
1253669 1258288 If you read Richard Schickel's<br />biography of Brando,
1258382 1260419 he talks about seeing The <i>Wild</i> One
1260509 1264093 and how it was a cinema experience<br />for him as a youth
1264180 1266717 because it was about youth, anger,
1266807 1270425 and Brando saying, "What are you<br />rebelling against?", "Whaddaya got?",
1270519 1272931 and how all the critics<br />and all the parents were saying
1273022 1276105 it was an incitement to violence
1276192 1279810 and he felt this complete thrill<br />of identification with it.
1279904 1282737 If you read his review of <i>Fight Club,</i>
1282823 1287863 it's a guy who is completely incapable<br />of recognizing
1287953 1291491 another wave of <i>Zeitgeist</i> film.
1291582 1294165 He's incapable of seeing<br />the same potential
1294251 1298961 because he's on the other end<br />of the generational spectrum.
1299048 1300834 Watch this shot coming up.
1301175 1303917 Boom!
1304011 1305752 I was trying hard to keep my eyes open,
1305846 1308463 but Fincher blew this air cannon<br />into my eyes.
1308557 1311675 I thought I should have<br />this serene look of fascination.
1311769 1314477 You should have.
1314563 1316224 I thought I did well,
1316315 1319853 considering the pressure<br />blowing onto my naked eyeball.
1319944 1323733 I would say that was<br />pretty much your opus right there.
1323823 1327782 If they can cut<br />your cornea and flap it up,
1327868 1328858 you can sit through a shot like that.
1328953 1331741 -Sure.<br />-If we give him a Darvocet drip.
1331831 1334072 That's right.
1336043 1338751 I love the way<br />this scene was written.
1338838 1342047 Jim Uhls wrote this. It's so funny.
1342132 1345090 Right here I knew.
1345177 1350638 This was done about three in the<br />morning. It was one of those 18-hour days.
1350724 1354843 Not to take credit from Jim Uhls<br />who did a great job adapting this,
1354937 1357224 but this is very faithful to the book.
1357314 1362605 This scene doesn't exist in the book.<br />This is completely fabricated.
1362695 1365528 -Cos originally, they meet on a nude beach.<br /><i>-</i> That's right.
1368534 1372698 -Brad fought hard to keep that.<br />-By the prehistoric sundial.
1372788 1378875 In the book, Tyler's making<br />a sundial out of his body on the beach.
1378961 1381828 That's right. This isn't in the book.
1381922 1384710 "On the plane, can we be naked?"
1387469 1393715 What were some of the most bizarre<br />reactions? Did you ever have to defend...?
1393809 1396176 <i>-</i> No. My sister liked it.<br />-Really?
1396270 1400104 -My brother and sister loved it.<br />-In the heart of the Bible Belt.
1400190 1401271 The actual buckle.
1406322 1408279 I love how dainty the soap is.
1408365 1411903 There's this guy wearing<br />this weird <i>Soul</i> Train outfit...
1411994 1414406 With the Fred Segal's packaging.
1414496 1418239 It is really interesting, though,<br />one lighting thing,
1418334 1422578 you guys really washed<br />the color out. Cos...
1422671 1426460 I mean, Brad's hair reads like black there,<br />you know? And mine too.
1426550 1428917 That's just underexposure.
1430220 1431381 Inadvertent.
1431472 1436592 It's so dark.<br />I like the film, but it's really dark.
1436685 1440679 And not just in the psychic sense.
1440773 1444516 Fincher tossed around the Buddhist thing<br />of you have to kill your parents,
1444610 1447898 then kill your god<br />and then kill your teacher.
1447988 1451572 Tyler helps Jack reject<br />the value system of his parents,
1451659 1454447 and then at the end, he has to reject Tyler.
1454536 1457153 If Tyler's his teacher, he has to pull back.
1457247 1461536 Tyler helps him through the first steps<br />toward enlightenment in a way,
1461627 1463664 but by the end he has<br />to pull away from Tyler
1463754 1466291 and to find himself as separate from Tyler.
1466382 1470421 I think that's one way<br />you can look at the whole thing.
1470511 1473924 I mean, Tyler's seduction<br />is a more liberating seduction.
1474014 1476426 It's the seduction of liberating yourself
1476517 1479509 from the entombment<br />in material possessions
1479603 1484848 and all that's familiar,<br />and not working on an emotional level.
1484942 1487149 -Here's Bob.<br />-Bob!
1487236 1491150 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Mr. Bob Stephenson.
1491240 1493902 An ancient friend of Finchois'.
1493993 1495859 And been in about<br />everything you've done, right?
1495953 1498194 And designs good sweatpants.
1498288 1503249 He's one of those guys<br />you need around for troop morale.
1503335 1508250 This was a scene that pretty much<br />anytime I saw it got a laugh.
1508340 1514882 Only someone like Ken Turan<br />couldn't laugh at a scene like this.
1516015 1521931 <i>We have to use the indefinite article -<br />"a dildo", never "your dildo".</i>
1522021 1524103 <i>I don't own...</i>
1525983 1530102 -He's subtle, baby.<br />-I love the scratching of the head.
1530195 1535235 "I'm not here to judge. We know you have<br />a dildo and I'm not here to judge."
1535325 1539114 This was power.<br />I felt a power surge, ripping through LAX.
1539204 1541866 It took Brad eight takes<br />to get into gear.
1541957 1545370 -You're out of your mind!<br />-He did it first one.
1545461 1547748 You kept<br />getting your head turned right.
1549048 1552507 Tyler, on a philosophic,<br />political level,
1552593 1556006 he definitely represents<br />a very Nietzschean impulse
1556096 1560841 toward the idea of nihilism<br />as a practical approach.
1560934 1563596 It's a lot like Nietzsche's <i>Zarathustra,</i>
1563687 1566645 the idea that nothing can change<br />in a positive way
1566732 1569474 unless the old values are ripped down.
1569568 1572185 What gets explored here<br />is the idea that nihilism
1572279 1576068 is a very sexy idea<br />when you're young and feel frustrated,
1576158 1580152 but that becoming mature<br />means recognizing the practical limits
1580245 1585285 and in some ways the hypocrisies<br />that nihilism lends itself to.
1585375 1589334 I have a funny story about<br />the night we shot what's coming up.
1589421 1593756 In the lobby of this building<br />there was a fountain which was turned off,
1593842 1597585 but the water was basically at floor level,
1597679 1599261 and right before this shot here,
1599348 1603512 I was trying to get appropriately<br />in that mode, right there,
1603602 1607311 and I just turned and stepped<br />right into the fountain.
1607397 1609479 I was up to my calves in the fountain.
1609566 1614276 -But the shot didn't have my feet in it.<br /><i>-</i> That's outtake material.
1614363 1619028 Literally, five or six people -<br />crew members - stepped in that fountain.
1619118 1622986 You would hear splash, splash,<br />and somebody would go, "Oh, shit!"
1623080 1626163 I said, "Shall we put up a sign?"
1626250 1628332 Edward's strength is he knows
1628418 1631206 where he wants to be<br />within the context of the story.
1631296 1633378 The drawback is sometimes
1633465 1636503 its planning keeps it from being fresh<br />- in theory anyway.
1636593 1641588 But the guy is just so exquisitely good<br />that he never gets in the way.
1641682 1642888 Me, I'm the opposite.
1642975 1647310 I let the day dictate what will happen,<br />so it's more hit-and-miss.
1647396 1650639 The drawback for me is when I miss,<br />I really miss.
1650732 1652689 I don't have that to fall back on.
1652776 1657270 We talked about that<br />when we were working on the script,
1657364 1660527 about how her voice<br />should trigger the explosion.
1660617 1661948 "Hello."
1662035 1664276 Thematically speaking,
1664371 1669457 I always thought that<br />at his moment of desperation,
1669543 1672535 he kind of has this impulse<br />to call the woman.
1672629 1677089 Which is pretty much the impulse<br />he should have been following all along.
1677176 1679543 But she's too much like him.
1679636 1683300 He sees himself reflected in her too much.
1683390 1687349 It's these underlying themes<br />that we don't state -
1687436 1691680 hating someone the most because<br />they represent you, yourself,
1691773 1694014 they reflect your lie.
1694109 1696100 It astounds me, this movie.
1696195 1702157 So as soon as he hears that voice,<br />he hangs up and then calls the other guy,
1702242 1704609 who, of course, is his imaginary friend.
1704703 1707866 So really, that's the beginning<br />of true psychosis.
1707956 1713497 Although he talked to himself on the plane<br />and he set the explosion in his apartment.
1713587 1717751 He's already done that, yeah.<br />He's just not dealing with it yet.
1717841 1720503 So he's been<br />a sick twist from the start.
1720594 1724633 Yeah. Fade in,<br />sick motherfucker goes on a journey.
1724723 1727385 Before we started, I tried<br />to get Fincher to let me be the
1727476 1729638 self-help group leader.
1729728 1732720 "Welcome to your cave."
1732814 1738105 With a feminine style. Someone<br />who creates your whole alter image.
1738195 1739811 We had to loop this scene.
1739905 1742021 It was one of those 14-hour looping days
1742115 1744402 where Fincher and I<br />were getting slaphappy.
1744493 1747952 On the last take,<br />we were doing some potato chips.
1748038 1749073 I love that he grabbed that one.
1750040 1752907 This scene<br />was another one not in the book.
1753001 1757211 -It was a collective effort in the office.<br /><i>-</i> Yeah.
1757297 1761211 No one cared for that.<br />I loved the Lorraine Bobbitt reference.
1761301 1764714 It just never went over. It crushed me.
1764805 1766762 We spitballed this for weeks.
1766848 1770341 This came<br />from a lot of spitballing.
1770435 1774770 -And a lot of Nerf basketball.<br />-A lot of Nerf basketball.
1774856 1778099 We had longer rehearsals on this<br />than my other movies.
1778193 1782778 -And we spent it playing basketball.<br />-Shooting Nerf hoops.
1789496 1793831 Most films do tend<br />to wrap things up thematically in a bow
1793917 1799458 and let you go out of the theater knowing<br />exactly what the intended message was.
1799548 1802916 And when films that muck around<br />in these kind of ideas
1803010 1807004 resolve ambiguously<br />and dump a lot of it in your lap and say:
1807097 1810761 "You have to sort through this<br />and figure out what it means to you,
1810851 1814219 "what components of it you agree with,<br />what you disagree with,"
1814313 1816350 people get very uncomfortable.
1816440 1818977 People don't like it.
1819067 1821308 <i>...television with 500 channels,</i>
1821403 1823815 <i>some guy's name on my underwear.<br />Rogaine.</i>
1823905 1826272 <i>Viagra. Olestra.</i>
1826366 1830985 I loved your insistence<br />on getting Viagra into this somehow.
1831079 1834947 -Your instincts were right.<br /><i>-</i> Thank you. And yours, with Olestra.
1835042 1839752 Olestra - a little more obscure<br />anal-leakage reference.
1840505 1844715 I wanted to be in this movie when<br />I heard we'd say "Fuck Martha Stewart."
1844801 1848715 I was hesitant until<br />I saw the Kmart commercials.
1848805 1852298 I've met her.<br />She's a handsome lady and very nice.
1852392 1854679 What do you think<br />of Rosie O'Donnell?
1854770 1859105 -Rosie O'Donnell hated this movie.<br /><i>-</i> I know, but you know...
1859191 1861182 It's OK she hated it.
1861276 1865019 But she said, "This movie disturbed me,<br />I could not sleep for nights."
1865113 1870153 It hit a nerve, it struck some nerve,<br />whether she wanted to look at it or not.
1870243 1875363 But she gave away the ending on<br />national television. It's just unforgivable.
1875457 1880543 I think you know the auxiliary track<br />is a good place to be bitter.
1880629 1886796 Cos basically,<br />anyone who's seen the movie,
1886885 1892130 bought the DVD and decided to go ahead<br />and listen to all this is a fan, or is liking it.
1892224 1896058 Or looking for ammunition<br />to bring us all down.
1896144 1898636 No, I'm gonna<br />assume the positive
1898730 1902268 and assume that<br />anyone listening in is cool.
1903735 1907979 Another thing that<br />informed the whole experience
1908073 1912237 of doing <i>Fight Club</i> for me was that<br />I was playing a supporting character
1912327 1915240 who was working 40 days over 113
1915330 1919198 and spread across that period,<br />so it was quite difficult.
1919292 1923707 One of the greater challenges was<br />trying to remain emotionally involved
1923797 1928007 and coming in, having had three weeks off,<br />to do another scene
1928093 1931131 and somehow resurrecting her.
1931221 1933804 I'd never been asked<br />to sustain a performance
1933890 1935927 over six months but erratically.
1936017 1940181 That was definitely<br />one of the challenges of the job.
1947487 1952072 -The casting for this...<br />-Fincher appears in all his films.
1957747 1960455 With a big tan.
1960542 1963785 I don't tan well,<br />except in a few places.
1963879 1968089 The thing about cigarette burns<br />is they run most movies on a platter now.
1968175 1971713 80 it's an irrelevant joke<br />but it was there for posterity.
1971803 1975137 Sure. Some theaters<br />must still switch reels.
1975223 1980263 -This was our first day...<br />-This was my first day.
1980353 1984893 Brad came in and we shot<br />till, like, two o'clock in the morning.
1984983 1988772 By the end of it, he was going out<br />and he had this look on his face:
1988862 1991445 "Oh, my God! This is gonna be like this."
1991531 1994114 I didn't go that late.<br />You guys had to go on.
1994201 1997068 No, you left pretty late.
1997162 2000280 Time flies when I'm with you guys.
2002125 2007211 My mom actually justifies this entire<br />movie... Cos I warned her going in.
2007297 2013213 But it's all all right with her because<br />I play a character who is "not really real".
2013303 2017547 It's really Edward doing it,<br />so she can sleep at night.
2019017 2020883 I like the fact that<br />I was eating with the people
2020977 2023560 before I broke the fourth wall.
2025732 2028440 I love that.<br />Brad is so funny in his choices.
2028527 2032896 He's such a dangerous<br />and so utterly present performer.
2032989 2037028 This is a scary thought<br />I'd rather just not think about.
2037118 2043285 My introduction to the whole <i>Fight<br />Club</i> scenario was over the Oscar period,
2043375 2045036 and I was being sent lots of scripts,
2045126 2047618 as happens<br />when you don't want to read them
2047712 2050204 cos you're bulldozed<br />having to do 10,000 interviews.
2051591 2057587 But just before some pre—Oscar party,<br />I met Brad. He approached me.
2057681 2059922 And I'd read it<br />and felt ambivalent about it,
2060016 2062974 and felt that it's a tricky thing for him to...
2063061 2066929 We discussed the moral issue and whether<br />it was a responsible film for him to do,
2067023 2070766 and he was very intelligent about it<br />and very easy to talk to.
2070860 2074603 We discussed it,<br />and then I met Fincher a week later
2074698 2076280 and was very impressed with him.
2076366 2079404 Particularly because he was<br />so unlike what I'd expected.
2079494 2084455 I thought I'd get a full 150% testosterone,
2084541 2089911 macho, possibly<br />somewhat immature, adult.
2090880 2096250 Actually, what struck me about Fincher<br />was he's a particularly soft and feminine,
2096344 2099928 but highly articulate<br />and persuasive individual.
2100015 2103724 I didn't need to be that persuaded<br />because between the three of them,
2103810 2107929 the intelligence, the talent,<br />and the writing. There's a literate script...
2108023 2113359 You don't get film scripts, certainly<br />in mainstream or big-budget films,
2113445 2115777 you don't get that talent and intelligence.
2115864 2120950 It's so clear that in this scene<br />the whole point that is articulated is
2121036 2126247 not feeling shitty about what we've talked<br />about so I want to punch you in the face,
2126333 2128665 but that the point was to take the hit.
2128752 2133622 That it was more about the receiving<br />and the shaking me out of my own...
2133715 2138710 -Sort of having the experience yourself.<br /><i>-</i> Even if it's difficult.
2138803 2142012 This is some of our best ad-libbing right here.
2142098 2147719 This is a little free-form interpretive<br />dance session there. Unchoreographed.
2147812 2152022 -I love the postcoital smoke.<br />-Yeah, it's touching.
2152108 2156272 We reshot that<br />but it didn't get used. Why?
2156363 2157603 -Too long?<br />-Yeah.
2158365 2163531 When I first read it, it took a bit of<br />explaining. I found it funny, in a dark way,
2163620 2168285 but also felt there's a message here<br />that could be misunderstood.
2168375 2173085 I admired it for its boldness, but knew<br />that it needed responsible handling
2173171 2176004 because it could be taken literally.
2176091 2178332 I knew it would be controversial,
2178426 2183296 but I knew that the position from which<br />all the main artists were working -
2183390 2187008 the director, Edward and Brad -
2187102 2193064 they all had the right intentions and<br />they were operating from the right place.
2193525 2197018 One of the most interesting things<br />about this film for me
2197112 2199695 was watching the wave of the response.
2199781 2204025 Part of what was exciting about it is that,<br />on some levels, a movie like this
2204119 2207202 is not for your<br />average mainstream audience,
2207288 2211623 and yet it got made by a major studio<br />at a pretty lavish production level,
2211710 2215123 which was exciting because<br />we knew it was gonna be provocative
2215213 2217375 and saw that as the whole point,
2217465 2221675 and it was interesting<br />to watch it wash across people.
2222303 2226513 What's so interesting is so many critics...<br />That's not to say that...
2226599 2232720 In sum total, I would say, reading through<br />the national critiques of this film,
2232814 2237980 I would say probably 70% of them<br />fully went with the idea of it
2238069 2240436 and were very supportive<br />of its complexity.
2240530 2244899 But there was that reactionary 30%<br />that were tossing around words like:
2244993 2246199 "This is a fascist film,"
2246286 2250245 and "This is just negative and brutalizing,"<br />and these things.
2250331 2255542 Ironically, I felt like a lot of it came from<br />the left, from the reactionary left,
2255628 2257744 which is not what you would expect.
2257839 2260206 People saying,<br />"This movie really shook me up,"
2260300 2264419 or "I was thinking about it days later,"<br />that's the ultimate compliment.
2264512 2267630 That's why you do a film like this.
2268933 2273678 The whole water and electricity<br />mixture? I'm not thrilled about it myself.
2273772 2277640 There's no electricity in that water.
2277734 2280271 I always love the idea of Tyler as this guy
2280361 2284525 who doesn't bother himself<br />with the big issues.
2284616 2290362 He's standing ankle-deep in water and he's<br />trying to really quickly get a fuse out.
2290455 2296167 -"If you do it fast enough..."<br /><i>-</i> "You can be the speed of light."
2299047 2301459 As I recall,<br />we were semi-trashed here.
2301549 2303881 -It's possible.<br /><i>-You</i> were?
2303968 2309213 I do remember that<br />we kept hitting our own food truck.
2309307 2312516 Balls ricocheting<br />off the catering truck.
2320985 2325400 -Oh!<br /><i>-</i> That's a nice tribute to Drew.
2325490 2327777 We looked to create<br />our own entertainment.
2327867 2330074 That's what that<br />and the golfing came out of.
2330161 2335747 -You were naked during this.<br />-Yeah. Fincher chickened out.
2335834 2337450 What?
2337544 2341162 Brad went past me<br />and I flicked my flashlight up,
2341256 2344374 and we had a great shot of<br />Brad's naked ass riding away.
2344467 2347209 I gotta say it was too much.
2347303 2350967 -There it is.<br />-It was too much sensuality.
2351057 2354641 That came from a real wreck.<br />What happened was I wrecked...
2354727 2358641 Before, on a take,<br />I lost control going around the corner
2358731 2360221 and then we tried to recreate it.
2360316 2362683 -It's never as good.<br /><i>-</i> The what?
2362777 2365986 -The recreation.<br />-We can reshoot that.
2366072 2368609 When does the DVD come out?
2370285 2373323 This was a scene that got reshot.
2373413 2376906 We shot this originally on a couch<br />outside in the back.
2377000 2380868 This one was one that came out<br />so much better the second time.
2380962 2384080 It was this scene<br />that earned us the gay support.
2384173 2386505 While everyone else trashed us.
2386593 2389927 I love that they're<br />so comfortable around each other.
2390013 2392971 It's like the guys' locker room.
2393057 2397927 We still had 40 Tylers<br />at the Santa Monica Boulevard Parade.
2398021 2402731 Is that true? A lot of people went<br />out for Halloween dressed as Tyler Durden?
2402817 2404524 Yeah.
2404611 2408354 I bet too many people<br />didn't go dressed as Ken Turan.
2408448 2414569 This scene was verification for gays<br />that it was saying we didn't need women.
2416080 2421450 It's further proof of why we don't need<br />women. It should just be the guys.
2421544 2423501 I don't know<br />where procreation fits in in that.
2423588 2426376 I always thought of this as... Right here.
2426466 2429504 <i>-...the answer we need.</i><br />-It's a fantastic line.
2429594 2433212 But I always took that as,
2433306 2436389 "In this time, given right now<br />when we're in such a mess,
2436476 2439218 "we gotta put that on hold<br />and work on ourselves here a bit
2439312 2441644 "and figure out what's up."
2441731 2444223 "Then we'll address<br />the whole vagina issue."
2444317 2447435 Let me say this too, the beauty of it is,
2447528 2451442 take what you want, run with it.<br />I'm all for it.
2455036 2459325 This shot was shot about<br />four months after we finished the film.
2459415 2463875 We'd done an original shot, but you<br />couldn't recognize me, it was too wide.
2463962 2469048 I walked down the steps and lit that<br />cigarette I'd say about 36 times.
2469550 2472338 <i>-Did you see the New York Times?</i><br />-Today?
2472428 2475966 -The Versace thing?<br />-Oh, yeah, I did see that.
2476057 2480551 Her spring line of clothing<br />is the Fight Club Collection.
2480645 2484058 -You're kidding!<br />-Michael Kaplan sent it to me.
2484148 2488608 For the true wonks,<br />Michael Kaplan, the costume designer,
2488695 2492734 <i>also did Blade Runner,</i>
2492824 2496738 and Flashdance, which we're not sure<br />whether we should applaud him for,
2497078 2501697 but he did put women all over America<br />in legwarmers and torn sweatshirts.
2501791 2505705 That moment where you flash<br />the teeth was actually between takes,
2505795 2508162 but we were rolling a camera and I said,<br />"Let me see the blood,"
2508256 2510418 and you went... like that.
2510508 2512875 "Oh, we gotta use that."
2512969 2517008 -I love this intro to Fight Club.<br />-It was a good shot.
2517098 2520261 -It's the jack-off shot.<br />-What was his name?
2520351 2522763 -Paul.<br />-Paul. Right.
2522854 2526267 -Great voice.<br />-Great dancer too.
2526357 2531773 Except that every day I would<br />turn and go, "Oh, Neil Young's on the set."
2531863 2534571 This is a good shot.<br />It only took about 40 times.
2534657 2538400 Worth it. I'd go<br />all week on this shot.
2538494 2540405 Yeah.
2540496 2545115 Brad and I were talking about how<br />when we came into these scenes we went:
2545209 2548292 "Oh, my God! Everyone here<br />is a middle-aged biker."
2548379 2551167 We found out we both independently<br />went to you and said
2551257 2553498 we should get a couple more...
2553593 2556381 <i>-</i> Practicing yuppies.<br />-...practicing yuppies.
2556471 2560180 <i>-But do you see</i> 'em?<br />-Yeah. <i>We got 'em in and...</i>
2560266 2566228 -Yeah, it did look like a biker bar.<br />-Yeah. It was a little too fringe.
2566314 2568726 We're a little underlit here, Fincher.
2568816 2572275 Stop!<br />It's supposed to be in total darkness.
2572361 2575854 That's right, that's right.<br />Here they come.
2575948 2579066 There's supposed to be<br />a bigger difference.
2579160 2583074 I remember you getting<br />a little agitated that day when...
2583164 2586907 it was supposed to be this big "shagung"<br />and nothing was happening.
2587001 2590289 -Click.<br /><i>-</i> It's like the night-light went on.
2590379 2594122 Remember we played<br />with the idea of having me
2594717 2597175 lip-synching with Brad? Subtly.
2597261 2599468 We shot one like that.
2599555 2604300 When I had my first interview<br />with Fincher, I did have huge reservations,
2604393 2608887 because I'm not pro-violence on film,<br />particularly when it's gratuitous.
2608981 2613600 But since the film was about fighting<br />and the mentality behind it,
2613694 2615150 it wasn't gratuitous.
2615238 2619857 But watching it, and also<br />discussing it with Fincher,
2619951 2622943 as a woman,<br />I thought it was a real glimpse into
2623037 2626280 what it means to men, the need to fight,
2626374 2629958 and not so much to inflict violence,<br />but to take it.
2630044 2632706 It isn't specifically about<br />violence for violence's sake,
2632797 2637041 but it's more to do with<br />the sensation of feeling alive.
2637135 2639297 It's a desperate statement about society
2639387 2645474 that people have become so benumbed<br />and so dead spiritually and emotionally
2645560 2651397 that they have to hit themselves<br />in order to feel truly in the moment.
2651482 2656101 It's the same psychology as any kind<br />of addiction or self-destructiveness,
2656195 2660405 that people need to inflict pain<br />on themselves to try and obliterate
2660491 2666032 the other kind of psychological pain<br />they might be suffering from.
2666122 2671333 I said to Fincher... The first time<br />I read the book, I called him, I said:
2671419 2675504 "If we get the tone of this right,<br />it'll be like The Graduate. <i>"</i>
2675590 2681962 Which seems like a strange comparison<br />because none of the specifics are similar,
2682054 2687800 but if all stories are the same in the end,<br />or if there's really only a few core stories,
2687894 2690602 I think this is just like The <i>Graduate.</i>
2690688 2696650 It's a story of youthful dislocation and<br />of the feeling of entering the adult world
2696736 2700400 and feeling out of synch with the value<br />system you're expected to follow,
2700489 2705780 and trying to figure out the answer<br />to the question of how to be happy.
2705870 2708658 I think The <i>Graduate</i> is very much about
2708748 2714960 a guy, obviously, who's out of synch<br />with what he's expected to plug into.
2715046 2718914 The thing I love about The <i>Graduate</i><br />is that at the end it's so ambiguous.
2719008 2721124 It's no clear-cut victory.
2721219 2724632 It's not that they're smiling<br />as they're on the bus
2724722 2726133 and you know they'll be happy forever,
2726224 2729137 it's more just that there's sort of a feeling:
2729227 2730809 "I'm not quite sure what I've done,
2730895 2734479 "but I think I've taken a step<br />in the right direction."
2734565 2737557 Fincher and Brad and I<br />used to talk about it a lot.
2737652 2740519 It's a story about a person<br />finding a path to maturity,
2740613 2743071 or going on a journey of figuring out<br />how to be mature,
2743157 2745194 and in a similar way, this is...
2745284 2750745 It's not quite the same complaint, but I<br />think <i>Fight Club's</i> very much a story about
2750831 2756702 a guy feeling disconnected and numb<br />in the face of the value systems,
2756796 2759333 who, through Tyler, like Mrs. Robinson,
2759423 2765886 goes off and basically explores<br />his more nihilistic impulses,
2765972 2769306 his impulses toward saying "fuck you"<br />to the whole thing.
2770309 2774303 We got worked up just watching<br />these fights. On set, we'd watch 20 takes,
2774397 2779062 and you still get worked up,<br />you can't help it. I don't know what that is.
2779151 2782314 But the DNA starts moving.
2782405 2784567 There's a brilliant line too.
2784657 2787820 I see the exact same energy and rush
2787910 2790823 we had sitting around<br />watching these fights as...
2790913 2794122 I grew up in the Bible Belt,<br />and it's the same thing in a revival,
2794208 2796700 that energy that takes over.
2796794 2801209 People say that's God,<br />but it's the energy of the mob.
2801299 2803961 I love how Tyler's always<br />in the background.
2804051 2805166 <i>Out of</i> focus.
2805261 2807969 Like the little devil on your shoulder.
2808055 2810717 The little voice in your head.
2815813 2818805 Once you have watched the movie
2818899 2823894 and you know what the real underlying<br />reality of it is in terms of Jack and Tyler,
2823988 2828653 it's fun to watch it and think about<br />the whole thing from Maria's perspective.
2828743 2833158 Most people I know - even the ones<br />who loved it the first time -
2833247 2836114 have said that they really<br />liked it more the second time,
2836208 2838745 that they got much much more out of it.
2839545 2845257 Because... it's such a sad and funny<br />portrait of a guy who's completely insane.
2849638 2852255 That was my glamour shot.
2855561 2860431 This is where my character's OD'd on<br />Xanax - something I wasn't familiar with.
2860524 2864859 I remember going to the medical for<br />insurance before doing a film and I said:
2864945 2868438 "How many Xanax do you need to take<br />in order to kill yourself?"
2868532 2873277 She did look at me a bit oddly. Then<br />I explained, of course, it was for a role.
2875289 2878873 Here, I was supposed<br />to be doing sit-ups or something.
2878959 2882122 I don't know how the martial arts<br />got there but this was the start.
2882213 2885581 I asked if anyone had<br />any nun-chucks moves,
2885674 2888006 and one guy showed us a little move.
2888094 2890756 I'm doing nothing that makes any sense,
2890846 2896558 but from a distance it looks like<br />someone would know what I'm doing.
2899313 2905229 I love all that falling into frame. She's<br />always moving into frame or out of frame.
2906028 2908895 We were trying to Marla playful,<br />so it didn't...
2908989 2914735 Even though she's, you know,<br />a kind of fashionable nihilist
2914829 2917412 that there's something playful about her.
2921085 2924794 Now, this is a shot... Those aren't<br />my breasts, I hasten to add.
2924880 2927838 I wish they were.
2927925 2932340 This is a computer-generated shot,<br />which consisted and demanded
2932430 2936389 me and Brad taking positions<br />from the <i>Kama Sutra</i> for about 12 hours
2936475 2938967 and having still cameras<br />take pictures of us.
2939061 2941177 We were covered in dots,
2941272 2946108 painted white dots all over our bodies<br />that the computer could recognize,
2946193 2948855 and then it was fed into the computer.
2948946 2951859 That's Fincher's<br />version of a sex scene.
2951949 2954657 He kept saying,<br />"I wanna fly between her stomach,
2954743 2956484 "around her breasts, under her arms,
2956579 2960789 "and through these beads of sweat,<br />frozen like Luke Skywalker."
2960875 2964209 I was, like, "Sure, Fincher.<br />Whatever you want, man."
2965296 2969381 -I love this. The gargle's so great.<br />-And the wink.
2969467 2973552 It's so funny to watch this movie once<br />you know what the underlying reality is.
2973637 2976971 It's really funny to watch<br />all these scenes with her.
2977057 2981972 She's so funny. She comes down,<br />she gargles coffee, gives him a wink...
2984773 2987105 He's a jerk to her and she leaves.
2987193 2990151 People told me<br />they would be, like, "We hate her!"
2990237 2993320 Then the second time you see it,<br />you feel so sorry for her.
2993407 2996570 She endures so much awfulness.
2999038 3002622 -Whose robe was that?<br />-It was my roommate's horrible robe.
3002708 3007327 This was her ratty, rotten robe.<br />I borrowed it for the flick.
3007421 3009628 Andy <i>and</i> I came <i>to</i> your house,
3009715 3012628 so he comes down in that robe,<br />he's, "Is this Tyler?"
3012718 3016211 He's got the sunglasses<br />and the Gucci loafers, and I was, like:
3016305 3020139 "OK. Pack it up, put it in a box,<br />send it over to the set."
3020226 3023184 It was hilarious.
3023270 3026183 Fincher's so<br />funny himself, so he adds in...
3026649 3028731 "Death hairball", that was his idea.
3028817 3031024 I remember feeling profoundly sick,
3031111 3034024 delivering that line<br />time after time upside down.
3034114 3038608 But I loved the way<br />he shot that whole telephone sequence.
3040329 3045290 We shot this movie...<br />I think there was 138 days of shooting.
3045376 3048459 I shot on probably 130 of 'em.
3048546 3051254 It was the longest shoot I've ever been on.
3051340 3054503 I worked every day<br />of the principal photography.
3054593 3057051 I think this scene that<br />we're going through is
3057137 3062223 the only 40 seconds of the film<br />that I'm not in.
3062309 3066974 I think this was probably<br />about the only half-day I had off.
3068941 3071399 This scene does contain a dildo,
3071485 3077572 which I'd specified had to be<br />on the larger side for the joke to work.
3078784 3081867 Bucky, who's an incredibly thorough<br />props buyer,
3081954 3085572 approached me rather embarrassed<br />one day, saying, "Ahem,"
3085666 3089830 and took me aside, and showed me<br />a whole range of dildos to choose from.
3089920 3094585 I think I got a hamper full of dildos<br />for my goodbye present.
3098095 3100257 I loved throwing Helena around.
3100347 3105137 -I like the dance, makes me laugh.<br />-It's to throw 'em off.
3105227 3109346 What's funny about it is when<br />you shot it, you didn't have the music.
3109440 3115777 -But when the music's in there, it's funny.<br />-Finch said it'd be drifting down the hall.
3117364 3119526 She's not frail either, I'll tell you that.
3119617 3121449 <i>Yes, she “vs.</i>
3121535 3124027 Yeah, she's so teensy, though.
3125205 3129494 It's a relief when a director knows<br />what they're doing and what they want,
3129585 3133294 but contributes to the characterization<br />in the way they see it
3133380 3136793 and how they're gonna frame you<br />and light you.
3136884 3141674 He also has such specific ideas<br />about costume and lighting,
3141764 3143550 but down to such detail.
3143641 3147976 Tyler is just all unrestrained,<br />blunt statement of everything.
3148062 3150599 There's very little beneath<br />the surface with Tyler
3150689 3154557 because he's basically<br />just an id charging forward.
3154652 3158020 He's all about<br />the purity of impulse and expression.
3158113 3161322 He's almost a Puckish figure.<br />He's the spirit of mischief.
3161408 3164821 My character is all repressed impulses.
3164912 3167074 That's why I love the device<br />of the voice-over.
3167164 3170657 One thing gets said and then<br />the truth gets heard inside his brain.
3170751 3172992 He can rarely say what he's really thinking.
3173087 3176751 <i>My God. I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.</i>
3176840 3179298 The crew started laughing then.
3179385 3182343 I didn't get it,<br />because the cultural difference.
3182429 3186172 I thought grade school was<br />normal school, not primary school.
3186266 3190760 The original line was actually, "I wanna<br />get pregnant. I wanna have your abortion,"
3190854 3193721 which was then deemed<br />as too abominable a line.
3193816 3198026 So we reshot it,<br />and that was David's rewrite.
3198112 3203107 We didn't quite find the right tone<br />in this scene. It just reads a little frat guy.
3203200 3206784 Just kinda missed the mark<br />by a few beats.
3206870 3212206 But the flashbacks and where we finish off<br />on them and don't speak saved it.
3212292 3214784 <i>-Yeah, I promise.<br />Promise?</i>
3214878 3218212 I love that moment of<br />"That's three times you promised."
3218298 3224214 I love the little petulant stuff,<br />the schoolboy stuff that Tyler always has.
3224304 3228389 -There you go. "Promise? Promise?"<br /><i>-</i> Some kind of strange code.
3228475 3235393 This is HBC and I just sitting in a room,<br />sitting there screaming our guts out.
3235482 3238850 Originally in the book,<br />there was this whole thing about
3238944 3241356 "I am Joe's gallbladder."
3241447 3245862 It was based on<br />this Reader's Digest series that was...
3245951 3248283 Real. My parents remembered it.
3248370 3251988 We couldn't get clearance<br />from Reader's Digest,
3252082 3256167 so we had to come up with<br />a fake Reader's Digest magazine,
3256253 3258085 <i>which was The Annotated Reader,</i>
3258172 3263167 which is what that magazine is<br />that you see Edward reading all the time.
3263260 3267845 I love this suggestive shot right here,<br />through the crack of the door.
3268682 3271174 It looks like we're reinventing sex.
3271268 3274602 All we're doing is flipping<br />and jumping on the bed.
3274688 3279273 -You look nice and bronzed there.<br />-All for you, big boy.
3279359 3282522 Remember Helena in Venice,<br />Helena's mother?
3282613 3287232 She was laughing because we were...<br />Cos there's the rubber glove scene.
3287326 3291115 I remember when the film was in the spool<br />and we were getting ready,
3291205 3293287 and I sank into my chair, cos I'm going:
3293373 3299369 "Helena's mother's here and Brad's gonna<br />be half-naked, pulling off a rubber glove."
3299463 3304583 She was howling with laughter. May<br />have been just she was so embarrassed.
3308597 3313967 -Was the rubber glove your idea?<br />-I take full credit for the rubber glove.
3315562 3318975 This was<br />all in the first week or two.
3321693 3325231 We could never get<br />the smoker's hack from Edward.
3325322 3330317 I would go up to him afterwards and go,<br />"We want that kind of..."
3330410 3332321 Do it.
3332412 3336406 -Don't look at me.<br />-It always gets a laugh, though.
3336500 3338366 No, it's funny.
3340170 3343788 The sad thing is we had<br />no qualms on these sound effects.
3343882 3349173 No politeness. No little hint<br />of embarrassment. Just, "Go!"
3349263 3351425 I spent so many days coming in
3351515 3357181 and doing voice-off orgasm sounds<br />on this film.
3357271 3359888 The first time was embarrassing,<br />but I got used to it.
3359982 3364727 David would say, "And roll.<br />And Edward, act. And Helena, orgasm."
3364820 3368859 It can make you quite dizzy<br />because you can tend to hyperventilate.
3368949 3372943 But I got that technique down.<br />That was one thing I learnt on this film,
3373036 3375118 faking orgasms repeatedly.
3381378 3385212 What's the Halloween mask<br />on the billboard?
3385299 3388007 No, it's a space monkey mask.
3388093 3390676 It's a Halloween card. I don't know...
3390762 3396223 Oh. I always thought it was<br />an allusion to the space monkeys.
3396310 3399723 Oh, no, no. It is. Yeah...
3399813 3401554 That's me reading into the text.
3401648 3405266 That's me bringing to the text.<br />Juicing it up.
3408280 3411614 It's a luxury having so many takes<br />because you know
3411700 3414692 you'll never walk away<br />without exploring every option.
3414786 3420247 But, obviously, the challenge is remaining<br />somewhat fresh from take to take.
3420334 3425295 Edward's amazingly inventive as an actor.<br />Perpetually inventive from take to take.
3425380 3429248 A great improviser, always coming up<br />with some extra funny lines,
3429343 3433007 but so natural in his style, naturalistic,
3433096 3436214 and has such an effortlessness<br />to his acting,
3436308 3441769 that I just only hoped that<br />it would rub off on me, frankly.
3441855 3445098 Any kind of ad-libbing or anything,<br />it was very occasional.
3445192 3447775 Edward is more inclined to ad-lib.
3447861 3450774 I never do cos I know<br />I'll never better what's written.
3450864 3454698 Particularly when you've got a good script.
3454785 3460280 I like this shot<br />cos it follows him up and then comes back.
3460374 3463036 What's really cool about this shot is,
3463126 3466994 which you don't get because<br />it's intercut with the detective,
3467089 3471458 but that it is all one take -<br />the coming in, the going out.
3487025 3490984 The year that this film came out<br />was a truly great year
3491071 3497363 in terms of a bunch of filmmakers<br />maturing - a new wave kind of a feeling.
3497452 3504324 I thought with this film <i>and Being John<br />Malkovich and Election and Three Kings,</i>
3504418 3508377 and many others I'm not even thinking of,<br />there was... American Beauty.
3508463 3512001 By any standard,<br />I thought it was a dynamite year,
3512092 3515835 and you get people like Ken Turan,<br />or even William Goldman,
3515929 3518045 writing these long essays about
3518140 3520973 how there's not anything good<br />happening anymore.
3521059 3524017 "Oh, for the days of so-and-so<br />and so-and-so.
3524104 3527688 "Look at what is happening in film<br />this year..."
3527774 3531358 It's so cynical,<br />and so counterproductive, to me.
3531445 3533937 This year, to me, was as exciting a year
3534031 3536648 in terms of all kinds of stuff that<br />was happening in film
3536742 3538278 as any year in a long time,
3538368 3539779 and you had these guys
3539870 3544205 just ranting and raving about<br />their own obsolescence, really.
3545459 3547541 You could walk<br />all the way around this set,
3547627 3551040 so this is leaving through one exit,
3551131 3553964 and coming through,<br />crossing over upstairs,
3554051 3556884 very quietly, not to mess up the sound.
3556970 3561055 And coming back down on the other side<br />and vice versa.
3561141 3565886 I love that this is all one take.<br />Pretty masterfully designed, I must say.
3565979 3567435 Thank you.
3567522 3571140 -Oh, no, I designed it.<br />-Oh, right.
3575405 3577191 <i>-</i> I love this.<br />-The song?
3577282 3578613 Yeah. Psychotic!
3582120 3585408 Actually, it was in the book.<br />It's in the book.
3585499 3589083 Luckily, it's a Fox movie,<br />so we could get clearance.
3589169 3590625 I was gonna say, man.
3590712 3595548 That was the reason<br />Fox bought this.
3595634 3597921 They saw it as corporate synergy.
3598011 3603427 "We bought this book.<br />We can use one of our old musical titles."
3604893 3610263 This shirt represents the camouflage<br />theme in the Tyler Durden wardrobe.
3610357 3613725 It's a little loud<br />for most people's idea of camouflage.
3613819 3616436 It's the basic Tyler guise.
3618865 3621402 In the book you never know<br />the narrator's name,
3621493 3624076 and nor do you in the movie know it,
3624162 3628030 because he's always calling himself<br />Travis or Rupert or Cornelius.
3628125 3630332 But he has to be referred to in the script,
3630418 3632955 so the narrator's name in the script<br />was Jack,
3633046 3638837 because he reads the magazine articles<br />about the organs, "I am Jack's colon,"
3638927 3641259 so we called him Jack.
3641888 3646052 On the internet, I've seen people refer<br />to the character as Jack,
3646143 3647474 so somehow that got out,
3647561 3651850 cos there's no indication in the film<br />or the book what his name is.
3651940 3653647 I knew what his name was.
3653733 3657977 Fincher asked and asked what the<br />name was, but I would never tell him.
3658071 3660984 An example of what<br />you don't know doesn't hurt you.
3661074 3666285 We used animal fat. You think it looks any<br />better than that? Might as well recycle.
3667747 3672992 This is such a disgusting,<br />but horribly darkly comic scene. An idea...
3673086 3678001 Obviously, the film was based on a book,<br />but was reinvented in this scene.
3678091 3683336 But originally it was Marla's mother's fat<br />that Maria was keeping in the fridge for...
3683430 3686013 I think to have her lips done.
3686099 3688932 Anyway, Tyler takes<br />Marla's mother's fat from the fridge,
3689019 3691306 and there's a funny scene in the book
3691396 3695890 where Marla's outraged that Tyler should<br />take her mother's fat without asking her
3695984 3698191 and feels so upset.
3698278 3703318 "How could you do this? How could you<br />take my mother's fat without asking me?"
3703408 3708073 We actually changed this dialog<br />cos there was an issue with...
3708163 3712373 They sent the script, or they sent<br />the scene over to the LA Bomb Squad,
3712459 3715952 and they said, "Yeah, that is the recipe<br />for TNT. You can't use that."
3717756 3721590 We don't want to unleash<br />that knowledge on the status quo.
3721676 3724384 So we cut<br />a couple of the instructions.
3724471 3727463 You're the most responsible<br />of irresponsible filmmakers.
3727557 3731972 The audience may not know this,<br />but Edward and I learned to make soap.
3732062 3733723 That's true.
3733813 3739434 From a woman who has her own<br />soap company called Auntie Godmother.
3752958 3757748 With everything else being<br />so washed out, that green suddenly pops.
3757837 3761956 -It's crazy.<br /><i>-</i> I love the Noah Webster reference.
3762050 3764212 Searing flesh.
3767138 3768674 <i>...searing of flesh.</i>
3778358 3781316 You see in this next shot<br />of Edward and Helena,
3781403 3784737 where his right hand<br />disappears into her crotch.
3784823 3787110 <i>No,</i> it's not!
3787200 3789942 -Could <i>be.<br />-It</i> isn't.
3790036 3792903 Don't ruin the myth, man. Let it run.
3794374 3797036 I love the goggles.<br />The idea of playing a scene...
3797127 3799994 Hey! Safety first, I always say.
3806386 3809378 We were talking about Joe <i>Black</i><br />and that was a problem.
3809472 3814091 Forlani and I, we fell into the same<br />rhythms and it made the thing drag.
3814185 3816722 Here, we're both holding strong.
3820108 3822896 This is a scene<br />that in rough out form...
3822986 3826445 To convince my mother<br />that she didn't wanna see this movie...
3826531 3831822 I was particularly worried about this<br />scene and my parents viewing this scene.
3831911 3834699 I showed my mom this scene<br />and she went, "Hm."
3834789 3837156 She looked like<br />she smelled something bad.
3837250 3839833 She was, like,<br />"I won't go to the premiere of this."
3839919 3844004 This is one of my<br />father's favorite scenes.
3844090 3846582 -Your father's. ..<br />-He's a ground-breaker.
3846676 3850089 -Well, he's only <i>37.<br />-</i> Well, there <i>you go.</i>
3857228 3860596 Hey. Give me credit<br />for that flip into the lamp.
3860690 3863603 It's truly amazing.<br />Not many actors could pull that off.
3863693 3867687 That and the smoke ring<br />that comes out of your mouth at the end.
3867781 3872070 -First smoke ring I've ever done.<br />-It's amazing.
3874162 3877575 -I like this woman.<br /><i>-</i> The woman in the background,
3877665 3880032 we had to keep moving her in position
3880126 3882333 cos she made the same pass<br />at the same speed
3882420 3887506 and we always wanted to make sure that<br />she was in frame when the voice-over said:
3887592 3890175 "We were selling rich women<br />their own fat asses back."
3890261 3894050 So we'd continually move her mark back<br />so she would be right there.
3894140 3900102 I have an interesting perspective<br />on this scene. I'd like to hear Fincher's...
3900188 3903351 When we did this,<br />this was the first week of shooting.
3903441 3906650 -You reshot this one, didn't you?<br />-We did, yeah.
3908530 3910066 We reshot and then threw out the reshoot.
3910156 3912067 Exactly. We did it,
3912158 3914024 and it was Wednesday,
3914119 3918955 cos we spent that Thursday and Friday<br />entirely shooting me beating myself up.
3919040 3923079 And we shot this,<br />and we did it and we did it and we did it,
3923169 3928039 and you kept telling me different things,<br />different notes, and I was getting lost.
3928133 3929919 It was the first week.
3930009 3933968 I had this perception<br />that you were going, "Oh, fuck!"
3934055 3937093 "This is not going well," or something.
3937183 3943646 I felt it was the first week and everybody's<br />getting in the groove, you know,
3943731 3945847 and we kept doing this, and I thought:
3945942 3950778 "I feel like we have some good ones, ones<br />I'm happy with." But you seemed unhappy.
3950864 3956780 What it was was there was a...<br />neutrality to it. It wasn't as threatening.
3956870 3960079 Cos I always wanted this to be<br />the Travis Bickle moment,
3960165 3963874 where the boss realizes<br />that this guy is truly fucked up.
3963960 3968454 -Which I think you do.<br />-But the thing that happened
3968548 3970630 after we did the reshoot,
3970717 3974585 which I like a lot better<br />cos it's really cold and really deadly,
3974679 3977296 was that Columbine happened.
3977390 3979597 So when we tested it with the reshoot in,
3979684 3984394 which was much more dangerous and evil,
3984481 3987018 all of a sudden, it was...
3987108 3990100 If we were trying to make people laugh<br />and get a laugh out of it,
3990195 3992186 which we were never able to do
3992280 3996239 because people didn't think<br />it was funny after that...
3996326 3999739 So we went back to the original one,<br />which was more neutral,
3999829 4004744 you make up your mind -<br />is he really deranged, or is he pretending?
4014135 4018174 Obviously, you view Marla<br />in a completely differently way
4018264 4024476 once you see the rest of the film and know<br />exactly what their relationship actually is.
4025605 4030020 Seeing it the first time, you think
4030109 4034979 what a lost and two-timing character<br />she is, and not that sympathetic.
4035073 4040318 But now you realize that<br />he's the one who's acting strange.
4042580 4048246 This can be seen as a sort of ploy<br />to lure Edward's character,
4048336 4050373 but it stems from a genuine...
4050463 4056960 Fincher and I agreed that it stemmed<br />from a genuine fear that she had a lump.
4060890 4063552 I got in<br />an argument with a journalist.
4063643 4065884 I was trying to tell him this is a comedy.
4065979 4069222 I got nowhere with him.
4069315 4072933 <i>-</i> It's a dark comedy.<br />-It's a pitch-black comedy.
4073027 4075735 I referenced these various movies,
4075822 4080567 but why is this any darker as a comedy<br />than Strangelove, which is about...
4080660 4085405 -The end of the world?<br />-The nuclear bombing of the world.
4085498 4090618 How could you rate this movie<br />more violent than... Where do you begin?
4090712 4094797 <i>-</i> Doing the splits above the bullet.<br />-We were talking about The <i>Matrix.</i>
4094882 4099592 He does the splits to dodge a bullet.
4099679 4102341 <i>Did you see End of Days?</i>
4102432 4105550 The gratuitous<br />completely—for—entertainment
4105643 4106633 <i>carnage in End of Days.</i>
4106728 4108469 <i>Or even The Matrix,</i>
4108563 4115105 a stylish, techno experience in which the<br />violence is literally video game violence.
4115194 4121736 It is violence as aesthetic, violence<br />as pure consequenceless entertainment.
4121826 4125785 But also, you saw things<br />in that film you'd never seen before.
4125872 4127783 I'm not ragging on it.
4127874 4131833 I'm saying even within the context<br />of the films that came out this year,
4131919 4136914 it surprises me that people<br />picked on this one as violent per se.
4137008 4139796 I think the title <i>Fight Club</i><br />didn't help us any.
4139886 4143129 It should have been <i>Glee Club,</i><br />you were right.
4143222 4146965 I mean, comparably Raging <i>Bull...</i>
4147060 4153306 Comparably, <i>Raging Bull</i><br />has as many explicit shots
4153399 4156016 of faces beaten up by fists.
4156110 4158442 One of the greatest<br />movies ever made.
4158529 4164992 But that helped, that it was<br />one of the greatest movies ever made.
4165078 4168412 If you ask me,<br />I'd say the same about this.
4168498 4174335 <i>Braveheart</i> has incredible<br />gore in it. Way more than this.
4174629 4178213 But they ripped out his entrails<br />at the end, so it was OK.
4178299 4180757 Just once,<br />we should have had Brad go:
4180843 4184837 "You <i>came</i> to fight<br />as free men, and free men you are."
4184931 4188219 -I loved that movie too.<br />-I <i>did</i> too.
4188559 4189515 I'm not picking on any movie,
4189602 4192640 I'm comparing<br />and contrasting other good films
4192730 4197566 that had much much more violence<br />that nobody even raised a peep over.
4197652 4202146 I don't think that's any of it.<br />The film attacks a way of life.
4202240 4207610 It attacks the status quo<br />that men have given 40 years to,
4207704 4211538 and they can't roll over now.<br />People can't roll over now.
4211624 4215367 But it's also,<br />film is fashion, let's face facts.
4215461 4218294 The fact is that it depends on<br />the time of year your movie comes out,
4218381 4220372 it depends on...
4220466 4223584 -The climate...<br /><i>-</i> Where mass consciousness is.
4223678 4228297 I think Brad's right.<br />It's also the fact that it was,
4228391 4230382 without showing any violence,
4230476 4235186 just saying certain things that have<br />the kind of cultural violence...
4235273 4239062 Yeah. It's an assault.
4239152 4243771 This is the central manifesto<br />of Tyler's vision.
4243865 4247403 And it describes a generation,<br />which is not just male,
4247493 4254411 that has an utter lack of direction<br />and has no sense of proper purpose.
4254500 4259245 But this applies to the women<br />of this generation as well as to the men.
4259338 4265084 Although I would say that<br />the solution that they find in fighting
4265178 4268216 is obviously more of a male one<br />than a female one.
4268306 4271048 But that's just to say that the fighting
4271142 4277935 is just a symptom of a much greater,<br />underlying malaise in our society
4278024 4281107 that the film is showing up.
4288910 4292949 What was your first connection<br />to this? When you read the book?
4293039 4296122 You sent me the book<br />and the script. I read the book first.
4296209 4298541 You read the book? Yeah.
4298628 4301461 Maybe not the script,<br />but I read the book.
4301547 4305666 I think the first time I talked to you<br />was after I read it.
4305760 4308001 We were talking<br />and I could feel you going,
4308095 4310257 "Did you think it was funny too?"
4310348 4314182 I went, "Yeah, definitely."<br />And you went, "OK. Good."
4314268 4319638 It's almost like, "Gotta make sure<br />I've got collaborators in my perversity."
4319732 4323600 -Exactly.<br />-"As long as you think it's funny."
4323694 4326152 "Funny in a sick way,<br />but as long as you think it's funny."
4326239 4330654 -Edward and I met up in New York.<br />-That's right.
4330743 4333656 To see if we were<br />shooting for the same thing.
4333746 4336488 Again, the first time<br />we talked about it,
4336582 4341918 we were mainly talking over the things<br />that made us laugh. You know?
4345466 4349460 -Nice punch.<br />-On that punch, cos the reaction...
4349554 4352137 That was actually a visual effects shot.
4352223 4355511 When Edward reacts<br />when you get punched in the wide shot,
4355601 4361472 we actually split-screened Edward out<br />and put in his reaction from another take
4361566 4366185 because in that one<br />he didn't react to the punch.
4366279 4368771 So we split him out and put him back in.
4368865 4375407 It was digital technology,<br />used for completely ridiculous purposes.
4375496 4377533 -I hate this music cue.<br />-Really?
4377623 4381036 Yeah. Cos I love<br />the smacking sounds
4381127 4384711 when it's the tie shot<br />and he's drilling him in the face.
4384797 4387084 -It's so brutal.<br /><i>-</i> You still get 'em.
4387174 4390462 But to me,<br />I feel like it gets muddled here.
4390553 4394547 -There's no music.<br />-Yeah, it picks up here.
4394640 4397803 Then really takes off.<br />Like we're supposed to take notice now,
4397894 4400977 and I don't want 'em emphasizing it,<br />making more out of,
4401063 4403976 "You'll pick a fight and lose."
4408487 4409477 God!
4409572 4415067 The shots are great. That was<br />a stunt guy and I could feel the breeze.
4415161 4418745 <i>-</i> Lou was a stunt guy?<br />-No, the guy who's off-camera.
4418831 4420663 On the close-ups, it was a stunt guy.
4420750 4423583 He would drill right into my face<br />and pull 'em.
4423669 4429836 I love... Brad, the laugh in<br />this scene is one of my favorite things.
4429926 4432634 I think the laugh is so funny.
4432720 4436429 We get ourselves in trouble<br />with the guy in the back holding us up,
4436515 4439007 cos he'd be pounding us too.
4439101 4441388 No, he's trying to pull you off.
4441479 4448442 You gotta get the guy off the boss<br />who's barfing blood into the boss's mouth.
4448527 4449858 He capitulates early.
4449946 4453484 I thought that's why we cut,<br />cos he couldn't hold him so long.
4453574 4457442 -You wanted to cut this?<br />-It was trimmed a little.
4457536 4461325 There was more that we got out of him,<br />like light bulbs and towels,
4461415 4466410 but we always had that question behind us<br />of the thug with the gun, so...
4466504 4469838 I just thought Lou capitulated a little early.
4469924 4473462 He actually does,<br />he capitulates pretty quickly.
4473552 4477967 -Pretty much from the time you dribble...<br /><i>-</i> Blood down his throat.
4478057 4481140 I gotta say, he was brave<br />cos that shit went in his mouth.
4481227 4485642 He was amazing.<br />The snottiest, most viscous fluids
4485731 4488473 came out of Brad's<br />mouth and nose and ears
4488567 4492606 and splattered onto his teeth.
4492697 4495940 And we'd shot, like, 18 takes.
4496033 4497694 <i>It was</i> nasty.
4501038 4505327 -Stuart Blumberg, salesman.<br />-I love this. The timing Holt has is...
4505418 4508501 With the spray...<br />When we get to the...
4508587 4511579 That's actually an untimed cross.
4511674 4515633 <i>-</i> Watch the shoe. I love the shoe.<br />-He learned how to do that.
4515720 4519179 -Both these are Edward's friends.<br />-Matt Winston.
4519265 4521882 Right here, the timing<br />on the second spray.
4521976 4524843 "Hey, man! That's fairly..."
4524937 4526393 The camera<br />starts to bounce
4526480 4530314 because the camera<br />operator started laughing.
4532236 4534523 Once he went, "That's the Bible!"
4534613 4538732 That's exactly the take,<br />we just cut the dialog out.
4538826 4541864 This is Dusties as well?
4541954 4547370 <i>-They found “is musk: from. ..<br />-Fiddler On The Roof?</i>
4547793 4549704 A Jewish folk record by these sisters.
4549795 4553789 It was, like, the Jewish folk music version<br />of the Andrews Sisters.
4553883 4555419 We couldn't get the rights to it.
4555509 4559298 No one could find who had the estate,<br />cos they'd been dead for years.
4559388 4562130 So we had the Dust Brothers rerecord it.
4562224 4566764 That's their voices.<br />They're all male voices.
4566854 4570222 It doesn't get much better<br />than this scene.
4570316 4572808 There's always been voice-over<br />up until then,
4572902 4576145 until,<br />"I am Jack's complete lack of surprise."
4576238 4580402 This was a major change,<br />cos this scene used to be later in the film.
4580493 4583861 <i>-We</i> moved this.<br /><i>-You moved</i> this <i>forward.</i>
4583954 4585365 No, it used to be earlier.
4585456 4592078 No, later! We had this debate...<br />Brad and I were... Because after this...
4592171 4595334 -It used to be...<br /><i>-</i> No, this came earlier.
4595424 4598712 -It came before Lou's.<br />-Lou's came after this.
4598803 4602421 -What?!<br />-This <i>used</i> to come before Lou's.
4602515 4606725 Then you come home and say,<br />"I quit my job."
4606811 4608393 He goes, "We gotta take it up a notch."
4608479 4611346 But I thought the notch<br />that it went up was to Project Mayhem,
4611440 4613272 not to Lou.
4613359 4616067 No, it led into Lou's.
4616153 4620943 And then he lets Lou beat him.<br />And then at the end of it, he goes...
4621033 4628030 So when we moved this to make it seem<br />like it's one of the homework assignments,
4628124 4631867 you had this dramatic tension coming<br />into it when he says, "We have to talk."
4631961 4635204 You're there going,<br />"Will he pick a fight with this guy?"
4635297 4641134 -I was mistaken on the order.<br />-This is one of your finest hours.
4641220 4644804 -Jerry Lewis is not dead.<br />-Yeah!
4644890 4648224 I did go through those tables<br />and bookshelves myself.
4648310 4649846 Like a champ.
4649937 4652224 There is<br />a Jerry Lewis quality to it.
4654358 4657601 Or, as we were commenting earlier,<br />Harold Lloyd a little bit.
4657695 4662735 This part makes me think Harold Lloyd,<br />the arm yanking him up.
4662825 4665533 Cos it really looks like there's a string.
4665619 4669829 That. That's the very Jerry Lewis moment.
4669915 4673328 -I love Jack's face.<br />-I love looking back.
4673419 4677333 Here's a clue. Why does it<br />remind him of his first fight with Tyler?
4677423 4682168 Because he was beating himself up.
4682261 4687176 My arms stayed up, so you had to cut<br />to get them to drop. I see that.
4687266 4692261 Yeah, those hits are really good.
4692354 4695221 The first time you watch a movie,<br />or at least the first time I watch a movie...
4695316 4697432 The glass on the hand is great.
4697526 4702316 I just took a little off the floor and stuck it<br />to the fake blood on the edge of my hand.
4702406 4704864 It gets such a scream<br />every time it appears.
4704950 4706816 Nice squirt on the fall.
4706911 4709027 Really good squirt, my friend.
4709121 4712864 The point is,<br />the first time I watched this...
4712958 4716201 The first time ever I watch a movie,
4716295 4719754 you are always analyzing it<br />within the context of the changes
4719840 4722502 that have been made<br />from how you remember it.
4722593 4725051 It's not, for me,<br />until the second time I see something
4725137 4727674 that I can watch it on its own logic.
4727765 4731554 When we saw it in Venice,<br />that time with the crowd,
4731644 4733510 it was the first time it clicked for me
4733604 4736767 on how well it worked<br />to move that scene there
4736857 4739519 because the audience laughed,
4739610 4742568 because once it's set up in the context of<br />"pick a fight"...
4742655 4745272 -There's the tension.<br />-Yeah.
4745366 4749906 I walk in the door and everybody thinks<br />he'll pick a fight with the boss.
4749995 4752657 It got a huge laugh.<br />It was such a great move.
4752748 4756332 There's these two guys fighting.
4756418 4759627 That's the Cadillac salesman<br />and the seminarian.
4785114 4787105 I was just thinking,
4787199 4793912 this is one of the only movies I've been in<br />that I like watching.
4793998 4797957 There's so much in it, you just forget.
4798043 4801286 You forget all the little things<br />that were in it.
4801380 4805419 And, uh... it's so visually interesting.
4807428 4810796 There's so much funny stuff going on in it.
4834913 4836824 The first car we slammed was<br />a Range Rover,
4836915 4839907 and the second was a BMW,<br />then at the end,
4840002 4843996 it's a new Volkswagen Bug.
4844089 4846046 I'll let Edward talk about that.
4846133 4851469 I saw it in a crowd in LA,<br />where that actually got a laugh.
4851555 4855344 Because the idea was that<br />they're going along and they're whacking
4855434 4859177 every conspicuous-consumption<br />luxury car -
4859271 4861353 Range Rovers and BMWs,<br />things like that -
4861440 4865308 and skipping the Hyundais and Chevys<br />and things like that.
4865402 4867359 Then we were gonna have -<br />I can't remember what
4867446 4869312 - and Brad and I were talking,
4869406 4874196 and I said, "I hate those new<br />Volkswagen Bugs." He said, "Me too."
4874286 4876653 So we said, "Let's put a Bug in,"
4876747 4880365 and we asked Fincher if we could<br />throw that in at the end.
4880459 4886375 Our spin on it, vis-a-vis<br />all this other generational war stuff,
4886465 4889173 is that if the VW Bug was the ultimate<br />symbol of youth culture in the '605 -
4891136 4894845 or the democratic car,<br />the car for everybody -
4894932 4898220 now that generation<br />has sold out all those values
4898310 4901177 and all become advertising executives
4901271 4905936 and repackaged the symbol of their own<br />youth movement and are reselling it to us,
4906026 4911647 Brad and I felt the Volkswagen Bug<br />was the perfect example of our generation
4911740 4915950 having '60s youth culture marketed to us<br />as something we should aspire to.
4916036 4921531 Instead of our own car, we have to...<br />It's like repackaging Bob Dylan.
4921625 4924583 It's from the generation<br />that cannot understand Nirvana
4924670 4930256 and doesn't understand why we don't<br />listen to all the good music of the '605.
4930342 4933960 So we figured we'd throw the Bug in<br />just to whack on it.
4934054 4936170 I've reversed my stance<br />on the VW Bug.
4936265 4941635 <i>-</i> You like it now?<br />-It's a great reworking of a classic design.
4941728 4944937 Nah. It's more<br />the principle behind the thing.
4945023 4948357 It's the whole "flower power" thing.
4948444 4953359 It's the flower vase<br />molded into the dashboard now.
4953449 4957113 It's the baby-boomers<br />selling us their youth culture...
4957202 4960285 I say it's completely reinvented<br />and it's fun.
4960372 4964787 OK, OK. I'm not cynical.<br />It's a nice car.
4964877 4968461 You'll notice in the background here<br />product placement.
4968547 4970754 <i>-No, no!<br />-</i> Wait, shh.
4970841 4972502 Whenever there is product placement,
4972593 4977679 there is also always guns, violence,<br />somebody crying.
4977764 4979471 This is our Pepsi product placement.
4979558 4983472 Pepsi gave us these vending machines<br />that we put everywhere.
4983562 4986850 There's always a Pepsi machine<br />cos we wanted to have that
4986940 4992731 ubiquitous logo-fest happening<br />in the background always.
4992821 4996906 -But it's only in scenes of violence.<br />-Horrible scenes of violence.
4996992 4999154 And I think that's appropriate.
5005167 5009126 I went to the Cinerama Dome<br />on the opening Friday night.
5009213 5013298 -What <i>was</i> that like?<br /><i>-Stood in the</i> back. <i>It was</i> a riot.
5013383 5015670 It was a great crowd to see it in.
5015761 5018128 <i>Run, Forrest, run!</i>
5018222 5021260 -Did you make up "Run, Forrest, run"?<br /><i>-</i> That was you.
5021350 5024217 -I don't remember.<br />-It was you.
5024311 5027474 I think that was you.
5027564 5030352 I think you just did it.
5030442 5032604 No, that was your reference.
5034613 5037196 I was at a concert<br />after the movie opened.
5037282 5044154 There, and in other places, I've had people<br />walk up and doing the Fight Clubber wink.
5044248 5046831 Walk up and go, "Excellent movie, <i>sir."</i>
5060097 5066719 I thought this scene -the push-in on<br />Tyler as he's coming up with his doctrine -
5066812 5070055 should have been the trailer.
5070148 5073391 The guy with his crotch in flames, saying:
5073485 5076193 "You're not your job.<br />You're not how much..."
5076280 5079363 Is this done CGI, essentially?
5079449 5082316 Yeah, Connie just<br />wiggled the camera.
5082411 5087076 -The camera was being shaken.<br />-Then we comped the perfs in.
5087165 5089577 <i>-</i> So that's CGI, the perfs?<br />-Yeah.
5089668 5094754 Just so it looks like<br />the film's coming out of the gate.
5094840 5098879 -I do remember Connie...<br />-"You're not your fuckin' khakis."
5098969 5101085 Conrad Hall, Jr.
5101179 5104638 That was our Gap reference.
5104725 5109595 Lashing out at the Gap.<br />But now they're on leather, so...
5109688 5111850 <i>-Are</i> they?<br />-Yeah.
5115193 5118982 This is an important scene<br />in their relationship.
5119072 5121905 This is where they're trying to have...
5121992 5125781 It's the first time he actually begins<br />a conversation or attempts some contact.
5125871 5127282 But it's at cross-purposes
5127372 5130785 because he thinks that<br />she's having a relationship with Tyler,
5130876 5132332 his best friend,
5132419 5136959 and as we find out later, Marla<br />is only having a relationship with him
5137049 5139256 and doesn't know that Tyler exists.
5139343 5141926 So the person<br />she was sleeping with upstairs
5142012 5145346 was the same person as Norton<br />in the kitchen.
5145432 5149096 She's got into the habit,<br />realizes that in bed, he's fine with her.
5149186 5156183 As soon as she gets to the kitchen,<br />he behaves very oddly and wants her out.
5156276 5158187 This was the scene where...
5158278 5163739 You know how we always talked about<br />people coming up and saying:
5163825 5166032 "I knew what was going on,"<br />and you would say:
5166119 5171080 "Bullshit, cos it's not a mystery,<br />there's nothing to have clued you into it"?
5171166 5177503 This is the first scene, I think,<br />where conceivably... maybe...
5177589 5181833 an honest person could say,<br />"Something weird is going on here."
5181927 5186091 Yeah. The shoe is starting to drop.
5186181 5191221 These are two people talking<br />at cross-purposes. That is to say...
5191311 5193598 If you see the whole film then review it,
5193689 5198308 you'll work out that<br />Marla is talking to her lover.
5198402 5202691 ie, when he refers to "us",<br />she has no idea who he's talking about,
5202781 5207196 because to her, the only person that exists<br />is Edward Norton's character.
5207285 5212871 Whereas, at this point, Edward Norton's<br />character, as well as the film viewers,
5212958 5216292 think that Tyler exists.
5216378 5219496 A complicated scene.
5219589 5224083 It's so misleading at first viewing,<br />so obvious at the second viewing.
5224177 5228842 This is a perfectly reasonable<br />question to ask your boyfriend,
5228932 5231845 and he's outraged.
5253457 5258327 I love how the character,<br />the narrator, never has time to keep up.
5260088 5262671 We're always a step ahead of him.
5276980 5277936 I read a thing -
5278023 5281937 I don't remember who it was,<br />it may have been Amy Taubin -
5282027 5286567 but they said they would have included<br /><i>Fight Club</i> on their list of best movies
5286656 5289273 if only the filmmaker's cardinal sin
5289367 5292109 -hadn't been...<br /><i>-</i> Violated?
5292204 5296914 Yeah. Which is, you can't have<br />two actors playing the same character.
5297000 5299458 <i>-</i> What book is that from?<br />-I don't know!
5299544 5300875 I read this and thought,
5300962 5303954 "OK, well,<br />that's the conceit for the movie."
5304049 5308589 Peter Sellers can play three<br />characters, but two actors can't play one.
5308678 5314173 Yeah. It was amazing to read.<br />I thought that seems a little...
5314267 5318352 I'm not sure I think that's true<br />anyway. I bet that's been in other films.
5318438 5321647 For instance, Steve Martin<br />and Lily Tomlin in All of Me.
5321733 5322894 Yeah!
5322984 5325567 <i>-Good</i> point.<br /><i>-How</i> about that?
5325654 5327986 <i>-</i> But they weren't on the list.<br />-—Exactly.
5328073 5331361 They wouldn't have made<br />Amy Taubin's ten best list.
5342087 5347082 I like this. Coming out like MacArthur<br />or something, some demented MacArthur.
5357060 5360303 When we were shooting<br />down in San Pedro, we had those...
5360397 5363856 There's these great new lighting systems.
5363942 5367685 What are they called?<br />The floating balloons?
5367779 5371773 There's these helium balloons now<br />with light sources on the inside of them
5371867 5374404 that you can float up<br />and tow them on a string
5374494 5377077 and put them almost anywhere you want.
5377163 5382033 -I want one in my yard.<br />-They'd be great for a party.
5382127 5385665 Cos Chinese lanterns are such a cliché.
5385755 5388713 Don't you remember the cops came by
5388800 5391883 because the San Pedro Police Department<br />got reports of UFOs?
5391970 5395053 <i>-No!</i> I <i>didn't</i> know that.<br />-Yeah.
5395140 5396130 We had two.
5396224 5401219 We had a bigger one, and a smaller one<br />floating up higher over the house.
5401313 5402519 A couple of people called in.
5402606 5404768 My driver told me that...
5404858 5410399 Teamster guys told me that the San Pedro<br />police guys who were cruising by...
5410488 5414823 See that smack? This scene,<br />I was first clued into Fincher's sadism.
5414910 5418824 He said, "Harder.<br />I want you to really smack him."
5418914 5422373 -It is Eion, so...<br /><i>-</i> "I don't wanna Foley a slap."
5422459 5425542 Exactly. If we get one really<br />good one, then we can use it for that.
5433136 5435252 We'd been shooting all night
5435347 5438510 and the sun came up<br />and we had to get this last shot,
5438600 5443515 and wanted to have that<br />Chinese propaganda rhetoric feel
5443605 5444766 when they're driving around in the Jeeps
5444856 5449100 and it's being blasted<br />over the loudspeakers.
5449194 5452528 We had a scene with extras,<br />so you were on the megaphone all night.
5452614 5456528 -So we borrowed the megaphones...<br /><i>-</i> Like a re-education camp.
5456618 5458529 Here's a really subtle clue.
5458620 5462409 See, I'm carrying one of the green folders.<br />And a camera.
5462499 5465867 We threw this in just at the last minute.
5465961 5469829 I'm carrying one of the folders that later<br />are the files of the buildings we blow up,
5469923 5474793 cos, of course, I've really been on this<br />demolition expedition with these guys.
5474886 5479801 But I'm coming in from having scouted<br />the building. See, there's the green folder.
5486856 5492977 There's a lot of little things I like. Watch<br />Jared Leto's reaction to me. It's totally...
5493071 5497531 It's a good reaction to Tyler.<br />He's, like, "Oh, let me get those."
5497617 5500951 "Let me get those, sir," you know?
5501037 5504496 The narrator's got<br />a whole other thing going on.
5504582 5508120 He's the guy<br />who's been left out of <i>Animal</i> House.
5508211 5510293 Stuart will<br />kill me if I don't say this.
5510380 5512838 But when he says,<br />"What did you guys do?"
5512924 5516212 They think he's testing them.
5516302 5518669 -See how Stu almost laughs there?<br />-Why?
5518763 5525009 Cos he was so excited that he did<br />the no-look catch, he almost broke out.
5525103 5527310 I've known him such a long time.
5527397 5529684 Remember he kept missing<br />then finally he caught one,
5529774 5530855 but when he caught it, he was so excited
5530942 5534310 he started to smile<br />so he had to bite it back?
5548168 5550785 <i>-The</i> smiley face <i>is</i> CGI?<br />-Yep.
5550879 5557467 They wouldn't let us paint the outside<br />of this building, so we had to track this...
5557552 5560089 -artwork onto the...<br /><i>-</i> But the shot's moving.
5560180 5562547 -Yeah.<br /><i>-</i> That's tough.
5562640 5565348 No expense was spared.
5565435 5569645 You must have had<br />an open account with these guys.
5569731 5572723 -They charged you for every little thing?<br /><i>-</i> Yeah.
5572817 5577311 -I can't believe that.<br />-It was brutal. Every little thing.
5580784 5584573 I like this guy. He's so stiff.
5584662 5587575 "Streets will be safer."
5587665 5589952 -He was great.<br />-Awesome.
5590043 5594037 I loved our news coverage too.<br />It was so accurate.
5594130 5600172 -She's a real news reporter.<br />-Yes, but still, it's very real.
5600261 5603128 I love the custom size 60 tuxedo.
5603223 5608889 Can you imagine if you looked up<br />and saw Bob waiting on you?
5608978 5612767 You'd be like,<br />"I'll just have milk... Water! Water."
5619697 5622439 -Pat McNamara.<br />-Stunt man?
5622534 5626152 No. Not happy about<br />getting thrown around the bathroom.
5626246 5632117 -Oh, I thought he was a stunt guy.<br />-No. But he signed up for one.
5632210 5633371 We told him what the scene was,
5633461 5636624 but he was shocked at<br />how much abuse he got.
5636714 5639877 That's where I bust my rib,<br />landing on the knee.
5639968 5645839 -Oh, you did the exact same thing.<br />-It was early in, first couple of weeks.
5645932 5648219 Remember<br />when they threw that pot
5648309 5653145 and it broke the bottom<br />of one of those sinks?
5653231 5656724 Hopefully, no one at the Biltmore Hotel's<br />listening to this.
5665493 5669157 I love how Brad's face comes in<br />just as you enter the room.
5669247 5672785 It's like, boom,<br />then he comes in to give his spiel.
5676754 5681544 And I love the idea<br />of the militant group of waiters.
5681634 5686174 -In Elvis wigs.<br />-Those are Clark Kent wigs.
5686264 5689347 -Is that what they are?<br />-Yeah.
5689434 5694679 Holt McCallany on the right,<br />he really has that Clark Kent look.
5712624 5714535 Now watch Meat Loaf.
5714626 5718915 His pants are down around his ankles<br />and he's pulling them up.
5719005 5721713 But we couldn't find a take<br />that was better.
5721799 5725884 Nobody notices, anyway.<br />Anyway, Bob would be doing that.
5725970 5729588 -He goes on and no one notices.<br />-I like that shot.
5729682 5735928 -That was a slightly undercranked?<br /><i>-</i> A little bit, yeah. 40 frames or so.
5752330 5756244 I was saying before,<br />this scene, if you break it right down,
5756334 5760248 is much less explicitly bloody or...
5760338 5764252 One of the only reasons people thought<br />this scene was as graphic as it was -
5764342 5768757 cos it's certainly no more graphic<br />than many a <i>Rocky</i> movie -
5768846 5770757 is the sound.
5770848 5776389 I think there's that,<br />but it's also the context of it.
5776479 5779016 The British film censors<br />came back and said:
5779107 5783601 "We find that the scene<br />where Angel Face gets beaten up
5783695 5785527 just goes on a little too long."
5785613 5787854 Well, that's the point.
5787949 5792159 The point of the scene is that<br />you've set up the rules of Fight Club
5792245 5795328 and you've set up<br />how people are supposed to react,
5795415 5797782 and this guy breaks the rules.
5797875 5801038 The people in the club<br />think it goes on too long, too.
5801129 5805965 -Yeah, they're horrified.<br />-And Rocky was fighting for Adrian.
5806050 5809793 -Rocky was fighting for democracy.<br />-Exactly.
5809887 5815382 I also think this little piece of spice<br />you added of Jared's face gurgling
5815476 5817137 didn't help matters.
5817228 5821142 They didn't ask us to take<br />that one out, just the punches.
5821232 5825317 I think, watching it in this context<br />without sound, a big part of...
5825403 5828646 I'm just saying I think<br />part of what makes the violence...
5828740 5830947 That shot is the one that causes problems.
5831034 5837155 But I think it's also just the sound.<br />The impact, it's making it sound...
5837248 5839740 -Awful.<br />-..awful.
5844797 5847630 <i>Don't worry, Mr. Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.</i>
5849927 5853215 Great clue there, though,<br />cos of the eye line.
5853306 5857891 -When he addresses Tyler Durden...<br /><i>-</i> He looks at me and says:
5857977 5861265 "For you, Mr. Durden."<br />And I say, "After you,"
5861356 5863518 and you say, "No, no, after <i>you."</i>
5863608 5866191 Very poignant.
5866277 5867733 This is one of the first scenes
5868196 5870858 that the studio wanted to cut,<br />which, to me...
5870948 5873406 The studio wanted<br />to cut this scene?
5873493 5876611 The car crash.<br />"Doesn't it go on too long?"
5876704 5880663 My God! It's one of the central<br />things between the two of them.
5880750 5884539 There's a thing you do in this<br />that I like a lot,
5884629 5886540 when you say you have to rethink
5886631 5889089 what you know about life,<br />about friendship,
5889175 5893385 and definitely about you and me,<br />which I always thought was funny cos...
5893471 5898386 -There's also a great little laugh.<br />-There's a laugh to it that's like:
5898476 5902265 "You don't even know how crazy you are."
5902355 5908397 Technically, this was interesting,<br />because this was on a sound stage
5908486 5912855 and everything going by those windows<br />is on a rear projection
5912949 5916988 -but thrown at least 40 yards there, right?<br /><i>-</i> Yeah.
5917078 5922414 I mean, that was<br />being thrown from far far away.
5922500 5925788 It just looks so good, though.
5925878 5927414 We learned our lesson on Se7en
5927505 5933046 about driving around<br />with those rain towers.
5933136 5935252 -Following a car?<br /><i>-No.</i> Just...
5935346 5937929 Every time you turn a corner, the sun...
5938015 5941258 You can never get anything<br />to match outside...
5941352 5945311 We were like, "OK, if we do this car thing,<br />it'll be rear projection."
5945398 5950893 -You mean if you do it in the rain?<br />-It's a nightmare, shooting car stuff.
5952864 5955731 This starts out like a guy<br />jealous of his friendship,
5955825 5962492 or jealous that his dad's paying attention<br />to the other brother or something.
5962582 5968794 I know we very briefly explore<br />similarities between Tyler and Maria.
5968880 5973420 They both certainly have<br />a very particular dress style.
5973509 5976376 Both challenge the main character,
5976471 5982763 but basically, Tyler, as he says,<br />is the person that he feels he wants to be.
5984437 5987270 The man.
5987356 5990439 -I love the seat belts here.<br />-Yeah.
5990526 5994736 This is a big scene.<br />I can't even imagine cutting this scene.
5994822 5996438 I love these guys<br />looking at each other like,
5996532 5999115 "This guy is seriously crazy."
5999202 6001489 "Why is he arguing with himself?"
6001579 6005197 He does<br />a great Brad Pitt imitation.
6014467 6016834 I love this, inside the car.
6016928 6019795 We've seen wrecks how many times?<br />Every other film?
6019889 6022176 And Finch wants to go inside the car.
6022266 6025759 "Let's experience a wreck<br />from inside the car." So...
6025853 6030848 I know how a roast turkey feels<br />from doing this shot.
6030942 6033104 Here we go, watch. Boom.
6033194 6037188 Half of this Lincoln Town Car is on a spit,<br />with us rolling around on the inside.
6037281 6040774 -With broken glass.<br />-With rubber glass.
6040868 6043906 Which I swallowed at least<br />a quarter pound of.
6043996 6048035 And airbags that can explode, which...
6048125 6051914 As we're rolling over and over,<br />we can hear Fincher going, "Fire!"
6052004 6054041 Boom! And the airbags go off.
6054131 6056543 "Again!" Boom!
6056634 6058545 One of the most beautiful...
6058636 6064552 It's beautiful. I just can't order<br />a rotisserie chicken sandwich anymore.
6064642 6068055 -You squirted your pants.<br />-I did not.
6068145 6073891 If anyone wants to truly get subtle, Brad<br />is pulling me out of the driver's side there.
6073985 6079025 I was telling a story that when<br />we did it, the Dolby guy came up...
6079115 6081857 They approved the whole thing,<br />the Dolby guys...
6081951 6085239 -Found a mistake?<br />-About the continuity?
6085329 6086490 "There's a continuity problem."
6087665 6092125 I was, like, "Really?" He said,<br />"Yeah. He pulls him out of the wrong side."
6092211 6096375 "He pulls him out the driver's side<br />and Brad was the driver." I said, "Huh."
6096465 6099583 "You might want to wait a few reels."
6102346 6105839 I love this. It's out like a dream.
6105933 6112270 Yeah. I was trying to find<br />that dreamlike thing because otherwise...
6112356 6117226 Listen, we got lambasted enough<br />about being preachy,
6117320 6120312 but I love Tyler's vision of the world.
6120406 6125321 You saved my ass here,<br />because it was a little flat, a little dead-on,
6125411 6128244 this drifting in and out.
6128331 6132575 You think it needed a little<br />of that point of view, of that wooziness?
6132668 6137083 You've just been in a car wreck and<br />somebody's telling you this whole thing.
6137173 6143419 Fading in and out, you don't know<br />what's subconscious, what is conscious.
6162823 6169069 This is the first time you've seen<br />Tyler's room and it's all nice and neat.
6172416 6175158 -Someone's been busy.<br />-All these human sacrifices.
6178798 6181665 Remember that guy<br />who was getting slapped walked out?
6181759 6184421 What? By Evan?
6184512 6187254 Evan was slapping<br />an extra who quit.
6187348 6191683 He was, like,<br />"I'm not getting hit anymore," and he left.
6191769 6195433 Good for him, man. 40 bucks a day...
6196607 6198063 <i>You know how much ether...</i>
6198150 6202769 -That's a very obscure line there.<br />-I figured that was Fincher's.
6202863 6207778 I love Marla.<br />I think she's a wonderful...
6207868 6212533 One key to her that we discussed earlier<br />on was the fact that she had a big heart.
6212623 6215706 She would have to have a big heart<br />because she has to forgive
6215793 6219582 Edward Norton's character<br />time and time again.
6219672 6224462 I didn't want to have to be<br />coming back to him out of...
6224552 6229388 I didn't want that to spring<br />from a victim, or need for...
6229473 6234343 I think she's self-destructive, but she is<br />only self-destructive on her own terms
6234437 6238556 and draws a line when others abuse her.
6238649 6242108 So the only thing I could operate from,<br />or the key to her,
6242194 6246233 was somebody that genuinely<br />wanted to almost save...
6246323 6251534 or recognize in Edward's character,<br />Tyler or whatever you want to call him,
6251620 6255363 that there was potential for a relationship,<br />that he was worse off than she,
6255458 6258246 and that there was an instinct to save him.
6258335 6260918 So she's somebody<br />who's intensely generous.
6261005 6268002 Strong, because she finally draws the line<br />and opts for self-preservation, finally.
6269180 6274300 Just before the end, that is,<br />before she comes back to him.
6274393 6277181 I think what helped me<br />stay in the character,
6277271 6278978 or remind me of her, was the accent.
6279064 6281431 I think if you've got something<br />as helpful as that,
6281525 6284734 a physical touchstone for the character,
6284820 6288654 as soon as you start speaking differently...
6288741 6291859 Speaking with a different sound<br />brings out a different part of you,
6291952 6294159 and I think that helped.
6294246 6300037 Then you just remind yourself. It depended<br />on how much time one had in between...
6300127 6305713 The scheduling, when I asked early on,<br />had been done quite sensitively.
6305800 6307256 On the whole<br />I was employed for blocks of time,
6308052 6309793 like two weeks,<br />then I'd have three weeks off,
6309887 6313926 so it was made as easy as possible for me.
6314016 6316303 It was a very actor-friendly shoot,
6316393 6321979 and a lot of care and thought<br />had gone into making our jobs easier.
6322066 6325525 -That Venice screening, that was...<br />-Surreal.
6325611 6328069 I was ready to take my own life.
6328155 6331819 You were much more so.<br />Brad and I were ecstatic.
6331909 6333820 I just remember...
6333911 6340908 I never thought we'd be carried out<br />on the shoulders of the Venice audience.
6341001 6344119 Don't get me wrong. It wasn't like...
6344213 6346671 But I remember<br />sitting there and just going...
6346757 6351593 It was kind of like too serious<br />an environment. It was too...
6351679 6356094 -It was a film festival.<br />-I'd never been to one.
6356183 6360393 I was expecting people to go, "Great,<br />let's see somebody take some chances."
6360479 6362140 And there was just this, like,
6362231 6366190 "Get them outta here.<br />Get them on the next boat."
6366277 6369019 I didn't feel<br />that as intensely as you.
6369113 6372731 What about the next day<br />at the press stuff?
6372825 6374782 -That was...<br /><i>-The</i> firing squad.
6374869 6377361 Yes, exactly.
6377454 6381823 I felt that vibe carrying into the next day.
6383085 6385372 This scene right here was...
6385462 6390207 In some of these very, I thought,<br />glib and lazy critiques
6390301 6393134 that were throwing the word<br />"fascist" around,
6393220 6395587 I was like,<br />"If you ever wanted the one scene
6395681 6400050 that makes the critique of the whole thing<br />explicit, it's this one."
6400144 6406390 Because the guys in black shirts and boots<br />doing stupid things are such morons.
6406483 6410818 -Isn't that the tenet of fascism?<br />-What? Exactly.
6410905 6415900 Isn't it the first tenet of fascism -<br />corral the morons?
6415993 6420408 -But he's saying the narrator's...<br />-That's what I mean,
6420497 6425162 how could you look at that assortment<br />of people and call it pro-fascist?
6425252 6427459 No, I never understood that.
6427546 6430413 It's so obviously<br />about what goes wrong
6430507 6435252 when a bunch of frat boys<br />start taking themselves too seriously.
6435346 6440762 When a bunch of undergraduate, fraternity<br />guys who have read too much Nietzsche
6440851 6444094 start shaving their heads the same<br />and wearing the same uniform.
6444188 6448477 But the whole way that this morphs<br />around him into his nightmare of sheep
6448567 6453812 just chanting their lunatic,<br />ridiculous mantras of...
6453906 6457820 -Durdenisms.<br />-Yeah. If you ever <i>wanted a...</i>
6457910 6462120 It's like Milos skewering<br />the communists in The Firemen <i>'s Ball.</i>
6462206 6466325 If you ever wanted to rag on<br />the Blackshirts, the Brown Shirts,
6466418 6468659 it's the best way to do it, I think.
6468754 6473169 I love how they build their rationale<br />to support whatever they want.
6473258 6474999 They take a cry of "This is over,"
6475094 6477882 and turn it into<br />"His name is Robert Paulsen."
6479014 6481847 It's really interesting when you see
6481934 6485472 censoring-type reactions<br />coming from the left.
6485562 6490523 We experienced this on Larry Flynt, with<br />Gloria Steinem writing this piece about it.
6490609 6491644 It's the same kind of response.
6491735 6494568 It's not coming<br />from the censoring right wing,
6494655 6498068 it's from the left, where they're saying,<br />"This disturbed me,
6498158 6503574 therefore I declare it an invalid subject<br />to have been made into a film."
6503664 6507578 Which is the most reactionary argument.<br />It's like...
6507668 6511878 -Bullshit, man!<br />-Yeah. It's really amazing.
6511964 6514581 -It's from the most surprising place.<br />-It's really regressive.
6519930 6524845 Any critiques that were against us<br />were hitting the back end of our film,
6524935 6529179 which... To me, I can't<br />see it going any other way.
6529273 6536191 Again, I think it's when you start<br />with a book that's... If you like the book...
6536280 6539693 I don't think it's coming<br />from people who have read the book.
6539783 6544653 There's often criticisms<br />where people say:
6544747 6549958 -"I thought the story should go..."<br /><i>-</i> Love that shot.
6550044 6551409 I was completely envious.
6551503 6555747 We parked there<br />right under the landing pattern at LAX.
6555841 6559926 We had the tower telling us<br />what kind of plane was coming in.
6560012 6562800 He was going,<br />"This is gonna be a big one."
6562890 6565552 That's power.
6565642 6569727 -We didn't have control over it.<br />-No, no, no, no, no.
6569813 6573147 Grab the 7473.<br />Get the small stuff on the other runway.
6573233 6578399 "We can't do that for you, sir."<br />This, to me, was...
6578489 6584360 -I thought it could have used more finesse.<br /><i>-</i> It's very kinetic.
6584453 6589573 -It's got that going for it.<br />-And these guys are such twits.
6589666 6593159 I think the people who<br />assail the back half of the movie
6593253 6598839 are working forward from the idea of<br />where would they want to see this go,
6598926 6603261 -as opposed to working backward...<br />-I never heard an answer.
6603347 6606931 There were a lot of people who said,<br />"The beginning is so original,
6607017 6611056 then it becomes this chase thing."<br />But that's where the book goes.
6611146 6616767 -So we're working backwards...<br /><i>-</i> But I see so much more than that.
6616860 6620649 Well, I'm not agreeing with them.
6622074 6626910 I saw some great thing about the<br />number of critics who panned <i>Raging Bull</i>
6626995 6631159 and had it on their "ten best films of the<br />decade" list at the end of the eighties.
6635420 6637832 We tried to cast<br />guys that looked like they
6637923 6641461 were in that picture of Robert Kennedy,<br />on the floor at the Ambassador.
6641552 6643793 I love this guy. Who's he?
6643887 6646254 This is Michael.
6646348 6650182 -He was a guy that we found late...<br /><i>-</i> "Is this a test, sir?"
6650269 6653432 Yeah. We wanted to find...
6653522 6659859 We were trying to find a guy who could<br />pull off that sort of Overlook Hotel.
6659945 6663734 -Lloyd, <i>the</i> bartender.<br /><i>-You</i> know, <i>in The Shining.</i>
6663824 6666156 "It's good to have you back, sir."
6666243 6669986 Kind of get that? He's so stoked,<br />he'll never give anything away.
6670080 6675291 Do you remember how the screws<br />in his head weren't holding to his head?
6675377 6680087 So he kept making it tighter and tighter<br />on his head until he's slurring his lines.
6682301 6685794 —Until his foot went to sleep.<br />—Into his frontal lobe.
6685888 6689677 His personality changed<br />about halfway through the shooting.
6689766 6692554 As he would move<br />you would see the halo rig on...
6692644 6697013 It was, like, "Gotta get that tighter."<br />So they were in there with the...
6698233 6701646 -I like Helena's hair.<br />-Her Satan?
6701737 6705981 -Yeah.<br />-The two horns of Satan.
6747866 6752406 This is when Tyler<br />becomes an alien.
6752496 6756410 What I like is that<br />he comes back as Bono.
6756500 6761245 He comes back as Bono<br />crossed with Michael Hutchence.
6761338 6764171 I love the idea of Tyler<br />returning as a rock star.
6764258 6768968 "I've been thinking about some new things.<br />These are my new accessories."
6769054 6771421 The glacier glasses.
6771515 6774257 I always thought<br />turning it more into a monster.
6774351 6779812 -I think that's what I thought too.<br />-I love this schizophrenic...
6781942 6783478 Flashbacks. What'd you do?
6786530 6788316 Jim Haygood figured this out.
6788407 6792947 He came in one day, because we had done<br />this fragmented thing, and he said:
6793036 6795448 "I think I can get this down really short."
6795539 6799578 I came back in and he showed me<br />this thing and I was, like, "That's cool."
6799668 6803957 -It's so cool.<br />-And it still encompasses...
6804047 6808257 Instead of saying...<br />If you have A to Z to go to,
6808343 6813008 it still says we're gonna go A to Z but<br />we're gonna skip letters along the way.
6813098 6816307 So you cover the front point<br />to the end point but you...
6816393 6819306 But it's more as the mind<br />would work too,
6819396 6823481 in that you get flashbacks,<br />you get images, you get moments.
6823567 6825478 Whatever I did we had to stick Edward in
6825569 6829153 not knowing what was gonna<br />be needed for the flashbacks.
6829239 6831071 Yeah.
6849009 6853128 In this scene I was nervous that<br />if at least once we weren't explicit,
6853221 6854177 you know?
6854264 6859134 If you didn't step outside into<br />an objective perspective at least once...
6859227 6865690 Cos we knew we were gonna do it<br />with the security video later.
6865776 6868564 But if you didn't...
6868653 6871111 Even though he's saying it very explicitly...
6871198 6874691 I love the look on the face there.<br />"Am I having sex with Marla?"
6874785 6878153 "My God, I am<br />having sex with Marla."
6878246 6882740 It's the guy who's looking back<br />on it actually in the moment going,
6882834 6883824 "Is this me?"
6898642 6901384 I was most worried about,<br />when the nickel drops,
6901478 6903469 if we would pull this off or not.
6903563 6906555 I'm most happy with watching it again.
6906650 6908232 You thought it would be a problem?
6908318 6912403 -Well, no, I was just hesitant.<br />-Yeah.
6912489 6914025 I remember when<br />we were working in the office
6914116 6919156 you were very skeptical of<br />the detailing of how the thing worked.
6919246 6920452 Having Tyler say,
6920539 6924578 "Sometimes you're watching me.<br />Sometimes you're watching..."
6924668 6928081 You were saying,<br />"Do we really wanna get that explicit?"
6928171 6929582 But I think it worked out well.
6929673 6934713 Yeah. It's 'Nam flashbacks,<br />is what that is.
6934803 6941140 -The phone number there is CAA.<br />-Definitely worried about exposition.
6941226 6942682 He's been calling Brian Lourd.
6942769 6946182 I wouldn't know.<br />I'm not a slave to those punks.
6961746 6964283 Love that.
6964374 6969369 What's wild about<br />those sequences is it does change...
6969463 6971955 You need very, very little.
6972048 6976167 Maybe it's just the more and more<br />we're used to
6976261 6979629 being presented with images<br />that are streaming across,
6979723 6983933 our capacity for<br />shorter and shorter images is increasing,
6984019 6987137 but you realize you can see things.
6987230 6991269 I mean, that can't be more than...<br />that can't be more than...
6991359 6994647 That's gotta be less than 24 frames<br />of stuff you're seeing there
6994738 6996320 and you're picking it up.
6996406 6999023 You absolutely get it, you know?
7021139 7025679 Remember our original premise<br />of borrowing from Buddhism?
7025769 7029558 -Under that, I see no other ending.<br />-Yeah.
7029648 7031230 We're starting from a place
7031316 7034399 where we're supporting<br />where we wanna take this journey.
7034486 7037228 A lot of people<br />are watching the movie based on,
7037322 7041566 "I'd like to see it go here," but it doesn't.
7041660 7045403 But again, I never heard a "here".<br />A specific "here".
7045497 7048034 Yeah. Me, either.
7048124 7054291 That's Ed Kowalczyk, from <i>Live,</i><br />doing his first film cameo.
7056716 7059299 He was really a sport.
7059386 7062674 He came back twice, right?<br />Cos we redid this.
7062764 7067634 This is when I always feel<br />faintly relieved we got to,
7067727 7070219 because I feel at least the audience<br />is on my side now,
7070313 7075103 or at least they know Marla,<br />and finally see me for what I am,
7075193 7079061 ie, somebody who's been having<br />a relationship with one person,
7079155 7085618 and with him and not Tyler, or Brad.
7085704 7088617 So you can appreciate her predicament.
7091543 7093750 There's a good little...
7093837 7096374 I do like when she says,<br />"You're great in bed."
7098550 7102544 -A little wince, like, "Oh!"<br /><i>-</i> I always wanted to get that in.
7102637 7105755 From the first draft,<br />where she talked about him,
7105849 7108637 I was, like, "She's gotta say that he's..."
7108727 7111310 You used to always say that.<br />"You're spectacular..."
7111396 7114809 And he's, like, "Huh?"
7114899 7117436 "If only you hadn't<br />said that it would..."
7117527 7119017 I was feeling so romantic.
7122866 7126609 See, I always thought...<br />I mean, you know...
7126703 7131243 I can't remember when we were talking<br />about it, but we were talking about it is...
7131333 7135543 This scene is all about<br />the realization that...
7135629 7137290 at a certain point, the realization that, like:
7137380 7140042 "OK. This has all been really sexy,
7140133 7143467 "but I don't want to be<br />an uncompassionate person."
7143553 7147888 Or, "If it's gonna involve the hurting<br />of somebody I actually secretly like,"
7147974 7151057 then that's the point at which<br />it shifts for him.
7151144 7155103 -You gotta draw the line.<br />-I think that's part of what <i>does</i> it.
7155190 7159650 It's not just the plot, it's that Tyler says,<br />"We might have to take care of Marla,"
7159736 7162694 that becomes the line across...
7162781 7167571 It becomes the line<br />that Jack is saying to himself:
7167661 7173998 "OK. I can define myself by saying, 'That's<br />not a line I wanna go across.“ You know?
7178546 7183086 There's the Seven Years in <i>Tibet</i> sign<br />on the...
7183176 7184166 If the bus wasn't there,
7184260 7187844 you'd <i>see The People vs. Larry Flynt<br />and The Wings of the Dove.</i>
7187931 7192175 Now, I want the out-take<br />where the bus hit me.
7192268 7195181 <i>-You wanna put that on the DVD?<br />-Can we?</i>
7195271 7197012 We can try and find that.
7197107 7199849 I think<br />there's an element of cruelty to that.
7199943 7203436 -Do you remember it?<br />-Did it knock you over?
7203530 7208445 It came in, and I became aware<br />that it was coming harder at a later point,
7208535 7213951 and I just put my hands out, so fortunately<br />it hit my hands, and then I jerked back,
7214040 7216122 but it made a sound.
7216209 7218826 I turned around after it hit me
7218920 7222288 and Fincher was up over the monitors<br />with his hand over his mouth.
7222382 7225966 But the hilarious thing<br />is that when it happens,
7226052 7231263 when you hear this thud and I looked up,<br />I could hear over my com set,
7231349 7236515 I could hear the wireless on Helena<br />and she immediately burst into laughter.
7236896 7242983 She just immediately starts cracking up.<br />And I was, like, "There's a good sign,"
7243069 7245686 Helena just laughing her ass off.
7245780 7249819 I love her last line there.
7249909 7252526 "You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me"
7252620 7254861 How many times<br />have we wanted to say that?
7254956 7261373 Is it true that these three cops<br />are named Andy, Kevin and Walker?
7264841 7267629 We've been through this<br />so many times with the Writers Guild,
7267719 7273590 cos Andy rewrote The <i>Game</i><br />and the Writers Guild will not even...
7273683 7277347 You can't even put "special thanks to",<br />it's a Guild thing.
7277437 7281226 -So we spaced it on the titles.<br /><i>-</i> Which makes no sense to me.
7281316 7286106 -His contribution was huge.<br />-Don't start me on the Writers Guild.
7286196 7288437 So we decided to bury his name.
7288531 7294277 So it's Detective Andrews,<br />Detective Kevin, Detective Walker.
7294370 7296407 That was our way<br />of getting his name on the...
7299542 7301704 Our little act of sedition.
7306800 7311636 -We shot this downtown, right?<br />-We shot this at the Unical building,
7311721 7314804 downtown LA.
7314891 7319476 That was a long day. I originally thought<br />this was gonna be much simpler,
7319562 7322179 but it was obvious<br />when we started blocking it that...
7322273 7325641 -Ain't that the way it goes?<br />-Always.
7325735 7328727 -There was a lot of coverage.<br />-You're a brave man, sir.
7333493 7335325 He's beautiful.
7345421 7348755 This was a scene<br />a lot of critics had a hard time with.
7348842 7352335 -I think it's so funny.<br />-Me too.
7352428 7354965 I always laugh at it.
7355056 7359345 A lot of people thought,<br />"That could never happen."
7359435 7363224 But the whole point is<br />that it's a nightmare.
7364983 7370569 I mean, if you're gonna get realistic, would<br />your khaki pants come off over wing tips?
7370655 7373113 No, but...
7374367 7378156 Right here,<br />right when you start struggling again...
7378246 7379828 The best part is that he's silent.
7379914 7382497 I love that he stays quiet<br />cos they tell him to.
7382584 7385497 Then when the door shuts,<br />he's, like, "Wait a minute!"
7385587 7389455 "That was my chance to be saved."<br />I like it when Van picks up this knife.
7389549 7394840 I was so worried. Even though this was<br />a fake knife, it was still sharp on the point,
7394929 7398388 and your legs<br />are constantly moving around.
7398474 7401387 I thought, "He's gonna<br />get stabbed in the kneecap."
7401477 7407223 This is my favorite ad-lib in<br />the movie -my favorite ad-lib of my own.
7407317 7410480 In rehearsal we were, like,<br />"We gotta keep that"
7410570 7413153 And then<br />it was trying to talk everybody into it.
7413239 7416322 "He can't say 'lead salad', that's stupid."
7416409 7418992 I ran out the door<br />and came round the corner
7419078 7423618 and Fincher and Dina were both laughing,<br />our script supervisor.
7423708 7425665 I was, like, "I think I'm on to something."
7428046 7434088 I just love your schizophrenic partner<br />setting you up to be castrated.
7434177 7438671 -He set himself up.<br />-"You said you'd say that, sir."
7441351 7446721 -That's a good match with Damon.<br />-He's only in there for one shot.
7446814 7449146 <i>-For</i> that one.<br />-Yeah.
7449233 7453648 That's the one where I tried to loop going,<br />"Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
7453738 7458483 -How did you slow that down?<br />-We used this Panavision box
7458576 7463787 that allows you to change the stop<br />and the camera speed at the same time.
7463873 7468458 -So we could go from regular speed to...<br /><i>-</i> Nice touch, mon frere.
7468544 7471707 Thank you very much.
7471798 7474711 This is a great shot. This one<br />comes across from the running,
7474801 7477919 lands there, whips over there,
7479222 7481133 comes back,
7481224 7483761 the pan goes to the trash can and away.
7483851 7485262 -Well...<br />-Huh?
7485353 7489438 -Well choreographed.<br />-It's great. I love that one.
7489524 7493358 My brother visited in this next scene,<br />where we hook up, and he goes:
7493444 7496903 "Why is Norton in his underwear?"
7496990 7501325 I said,<br />"Cos he was about to get castrated."
7501411 7504324 "Well, then why are you<br />in the buffalo robe?"
7504414 7507748 "Oh, cos I'm him."<br />"Well, then why are you...?"
7507834 7509745 I couldn't explain it.
7523141 7527180 That shot was<br />one of those things where...
7527270 7530934 We were trying to make Brad disappear,<br />we were gonna do it in the cut,
7531024 7535860 and then when we saw it on the tape,<br />it was, like, "He covered Brad perfectly."
7535945 7540030 When he bends over, Brad's obscured<br />so we can cut to this other thing.
7540116 7542699 It's one of those<br />moments of happenstance.
7542785 7545072 Serendipity.
7545163 7548201 -Happy accident is our friend.<br />-Bigger than all of us.
7564974 7570390 -This was one of those scenes that...<br />-We <i>ended</i> up...
7570480 7573063 I was worried<br />about how this was written,
7573149 7576642 but I liked the way it played.<br />It played much better.
7576736 7580354 I had a problem with this that night.<br />Kept trying to muck it up.
7580448 7586239 It was the only time<br />you yelled at me the whole shoot.
7586329 7591074 You guys were talking, and I didn't really<br />have an idea. I was just coming over,
7591167 7594956 and as I stepped towards you,<br />you went, "Just give me a second!"
7595046 7598710 And I just turned around<br />and went back and sat on the bumper.
7598800 7601883 No, but looking at it,<br />you were dead-on right.
7601969 7606588 The simplistic tact was dead-on.
7606682 7610016 It was something that when<br />you saw the thing play out in the two-shot,
7610103 7612185 you're, like, "Yeah, this could work."
7613773 7616606 And I love that<br />it's a defuse-the-bomb scene
7616692 7618228 that's not so much about the bomb.
7618319 7624611 It's always about this other stuff.<br />"Wait a minute, think about this."
7624700 7626282 <i>-Is</i> that CGI?<br />-It's <i>all CG.</i>
7626369 7630613 God, man, that looks really good.<br />Nice, nice, very nice.
7630706 7633789 Cos I find myself in movies<br />where people defuse a bomb
7633876 7635787 really not giving a shit.
7635878 7638165 -Cos you know they'll defuse it.<br />-Yeah.
7671330 7676370 And I always love this take.<br />There is that...
7676460 7679873 I always thought of Tyler...
7679964 7683127 He gets shot at and he gets pissed off,<br />but he's trying to explain,
7683217 7685959 then when you did that thing<br />where you lost it.
7686053 7690513 "Goddammit! Don't you... How many times<br />do I have to go over this thing?"
7690600 7694343 This is a great shot.<br />How many times did we do this?
7694437 7699102 -Three <i>or</i> four.<br /><i>-No! Try 14 or 15.</i>
7701277 7704690 The ones where we did the whip-pan<br />where you clothesline me.
7704780 7706817 I was trying to think, where did
7706908 7711197 the Bruce Lee tribute/parody/tribute<br />come from?
7711287 7713574 <i>We</i> took <i>it out</i> after <i>The Matrix.</i>
7713664 7720161 -No, just the whole karate thing.<br />-You started doing that.
7720254 7722291 In rehearsals you started becoming<br />Bruce Lee. You were...
7728179 7731763 Did we shoot this in two days?<br />Two days, right?
7731849 7734307 Well, yeah. We ended up<br />not having a lot of time.
7734393 7736976 We only had two days to shoot it.
7737063 7741148 -A lot of these hits I took for real.<br />-Except for that. Damon...
7746155 7749568 I hit my head<br />on the underside of the car.
7749659 7751115 Genius?
7753162 7756029 This hurt a lot.<br />This was the shot.
7756123 7759991 Remember? We did this one 37 times,<br />and Brad refused to do it because he...
7760086 7762578 <i>-Gave out.<br />-That was me.</i>
7762672 7766882 Yeah, that was you!<br />The stunt guy here, no pads on the legs.
7766968 7769335 I've never been more scared.
7769428 7773717 Because he does it the first time,<br />everyone's amazed.
7773808 7778052 Those stairs are hard. Everyone's clapping,<br />and then we hear, "Once again."
7778521 7781764 <i>-And he did it</i> eight times.<br /><i>-No, 12.</i>
7781857 7786476 -12?! No!<br />-And what take did you use?
7786570 7791406 -I used take number one.<br /><i>-No!</i>
7791492 7793859 I love the argument at the end.
7793953 7797287 I love the fact that he makes him<br />take responsibility.
7797373 7799831 Yeah, that <i>was</i> great.
7799917 7803626 -We struggled with this scene.<br /><i>-</i> I say we got it.
7803713 7807672 It's good because there's<br />so many things that need to be kind of...
7807758 7810375 <i>-</i> Covered.<br />-We need to have done the legwork
7810469 7817432 to be able to say, "This is what his<br />responsibility is, this is where he's going."
7817518 7821261 I love the fact that Tyler's just waiting<br />for him to finally go,
7821355 7823312 "OK, bravo, do your thing,"
7823399 7826767 and he never does,<br />and Tyler gets more and more frustrated.
7826861 7832482 "I've thrown you down the stairs, smashed<br />you into a mirror. When will you give up?"
7832575 7836569 And that's what I was saying.
7836662 7840155 The distinction that he's drawing here<br />that he hasn't in the rest of the movie.
7840249 7841956 He hasn't said no
7842043 7844705 when it's ratcheted up into other people,
7844795 7847833 into blowing things up,<br />into the commissioner.
7847923 7850005 He hasn't drawn the line over any of them.
7850092 7854461 He draws the line when Tyler says,<br />"We have to do something about Marla."
7854555 7858844 It's pretty much on that point that he says,<br />"No, I choose not to be that,
7858934 7861551 and in that I define myself<br />as separate from you,
7861645 7867186 and I want to claim myself back, because<br />I acknowledge that I do care about her. "
7867276 7870018 -The thing about that...<br /><i>-</i> Kill the teacher.
7870112 7875152 I was just saying I think it's good<br />that he... I like that he... In essence, he...
7875242 7877358 Cos something gets revealed in it...
7877453 7878864 In some ways, for all of Tyler's
7878954 7882538 philosophizing<br />and all his seduction of ideas,
7882625 7887836 in a lot of ways all Jack was looking for<br />out of Tyler was some kind of an intimacy,
7887922 7890459 which is the source of their conflict,
7890549 7893883 cos he says, "I thought this was our thing,"<br />he says, "No."
7893969 7898634 And once Tyler's moved away from him,<br />and once Marla gets threatened,
7898724 7901386 he transfers his desire for connection
7901477 7903844 back to where it should have been<br />in the first place.
7903938 7907226 I think there's<br />numerous other elements.
7907316 7912026 That you can control your own life,<br />you don't have to be washed around.
7912113 7915902 Finishing up what<br />I was saying about her is...
7915991 7919450 The thing is I always want...<br />I always bel...
7919537 7921403 This is the first time in the movie<br />I believe him
7921497 7924615 when he makes any claim about himself.
7924708 7928417 When he says, "I'm really OK,"<br />I think he actually...
7928504 7931997 -Means <i>it.<br />-He</i> means <i>it.</i>
7932091 7937928 He had to blow up the world to do it,<br />but he figured something out.
7938013 7941506 You guys saw the first cut<br />at the same time.
7941600 7945810 No, no. Brad saw one before I did.
7945896 7950311 I came back, uh... for the Oscars in March,
7950401 7953439 and I saw your first cut on a...
7953529 7958319 -The video projector here at Fox.<br />-A video projection of it, yeah.
7958409 7963779 It was probably two hours and 40 minutes<br />maybe? Does that sound about right?
7963873 7966581 -2:35.<br />-What's <i>it</i> down <i>to?</i>
7966667 7971787 2:15. Four minutes of titles,<br />so 2:19 all in.
7971881 7976796 Which is... I don't know...<br />We got a lot of flak for it being too long.
7976886 7980800 -I hardly think that's a long movie.<br />-I don't...
7980890 7984975 I think Peter Bart wrote in <i>Variety</i><br />something like:
7985060 7989099 "Why is it that a movie like this<br />has to be two hours and 15 minutes
7989190 7992148 when it's just<br />your run-of-the-mill thriller?"
7994987 8000778 Yeah, I read that. I don't think<br />he even specifically said this, he said:
8000868 8006989 "Even your action movies<br />are clocking in at over..."
8007082 8008117 Ugh!
8008209 8012794 -Screensaver.<br />-A screensaver?
8012880 8017169 -We were gonna do the gun going...<br />-Watch the smoke ring.
8017259 8022345 We were gonna do the gun going off<br />in your mouth as a screensaver.
8022431 8027517 -Look at that smoke ring.<br />-I've never been able to do that.
8027603 8030686 There's a tribute to Gary Oldman.
8030773 8035734 The Gary Oldman death scene -<br />no one dies better than Gary.
8037655 8042866 This is one of the first times I actually<br />did not care what anyone thought,
8042952 8047241 cos I was so ecstatic<br />with the final product.
8047331 8051325 What we were shooting for and<br />what was there was beyond expectations.
8051418 8053876 It was what I wanted to see<br />and I just did not care.
8053963 8059299 I understood that there'd be a lot of people<br />that would have problems with it.
8059385 8064050 It was dead-on for me so I was unfazed.
8064139 8066050 I would not have thought...
8066141 8070100 When we set out to do it,<br />I probably said to many people:
8070187 8075398 "If we get even 70% of the feel of this<br />up there, it'll be pretty wild."
8075484 8079227 Let's not forget, you had<br />as many people on the other side going:
8079321 8082313 "This is the most original thing<br />I've seen in..."
8082408 8085526 No, no. We definitely got...
8088080 8090071 ..just fixate on the evil.
8090165 8095035 It's amazing, cos when you watch<br />this movie with a younger audience,
8095129 8099168 they actually laugh at the absurdity<br />of a guy who's shot himself...
8099258 8101090 And is still talking.
8101176 8106091 There is a real defining age barrier.<br />Some people over a certain age go:
8106181 8110345 "Fuck you, you can't do that.<br />That's just awful."
8110436 8112427 I had a long discussion<br />with Fincher about this scene,
8112521 8114353 where I come back.
8114440 8118980 He's got a lot of explaining to do<br />since he's just betrayed my trust yet again
8119069 8123063 by putting me on a bus<br />full of space monkeys.
8123157 8126650 I'm pretty angry, as you can see.
8126744 8130703 I said, "I don't wanna go all Florence<br />Nightingale given what he's done."
8130789 8132996 He said, "Don't underestimate<br />what it's gonna look like,"
8133083 8135450 and the makeup was realistic.
8135544 8139128 But, of course, when I first saw it,<br />I was really appalled.
8142468 8143799 It's so deliberately ironic
8143886 8150007 and an in-joke that<br />this is Century City that we're blowing up.
8150100 8153638 -Love the Pixies coming in.<br />-That was a great piece of music.
8155814 8159808 And also, after all<br />the Dusties' techno vibe.
8159902 8161484 We've been all around the world<br />with the Dusties
8161570 8165780 and then come in with this raw guitar.
8165866 8168574 It's great cos<br />it's a great millennial...
8168661 8173576 like "We'll Meet Again" at the end of<br />Strangelove or something, you know?
8177503 8178493 Quality Control,
8178587 8182797 "Did you know there's a six-frame<br />splice of penis at the end?"
8182883 8185671 You're kidding.
8187721 8190383 Tyler lives on.
8192267 8196101 I gotta say kudos to Fox.<br />They really totally backed us.
8196188 8202104 Yeah. In fact, the first time that<br />I saw your first long cut of it or whatever -
8203278 8204939 you guys weren't there, Andy was there -
8205030 8209900 we walked out and were standing<br />in the bright sunshine on the Fox lot,
8209993 8214032 and neither of us said anything for a while<br />and the first thing Andy said was:
8214123 8217206 "You know,<br />my immediate reaction to that is
8217292 8220410 that the most amazing thing about it<br />is that it ever got made."
8220504 8224839 But I will give them credit too,
8224925 8228543 in saying that all the major people<br />involved from the studio
8228637 8232972 stand by the fact that they believe<br />they made a really great film out of it.
8233058 8236392 -I don't think any of them backed off...<br /><i>-</i> Not one.
8236478 8239391 ..the idea that it was good.
8239481 8241768 Specifically Bill Mechanic.
8241859 8244567 And the battles on this thing,<br />the marketing battles,
8244653 8248317 to try to keep this individualized<br />and support what the film is,
8248407 8253493 instead of falling into some kind of...
8253579 8257413 selling it like some silly movie<br />that's been done a million times.
8257499 8261288 I mean, even when this thing came out,
8261378 8265918 I knew there was gonna be flak,<br />and I had this idea.
8266008 8267749 You look back at Clockwork
8267843 8271882 and these films<br />in your favorite stack of lasers or DVDs
8271972 8276091 and what they did opening week<br />and it's pretty much par for the course.
8276185 8280429 On the other hand,<br />I had this idea in my head
8280522 8282763 that it would find its life now,
8282858 8288069 that it was apropos<br />and people were ready for it.
8288155 8294401 So there was still a little surprise<br />and disappointment on that level,
