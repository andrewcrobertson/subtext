125227 128094 MAN: <i>People always ask<br />me if I know Tyler Durden.</i>
128522 130012 Three minutes.
130107 132565 This is it. Ground zero.
133193 135237 Want to say a few words for the occasion?
135321 136607 [MUMBLES]
136697 139815 <i>With a gun barrel between your<br />teeth, you speak only in vowels.</i>
139908 141569 I can't think of anything.
141660 145824 <i>For a second, I forget about<br />Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>
145914 148030 <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>
148125 150082 It's getting exciting now.
150169 153287 <i>That old saying, how you<br />always hurt the one you love,</i>
153380 155371 <i>well, it works both ways.</i>
156091 159959 <i>We have front-row seats for<br />this theater of mass destruction.</i>
160054 162295 <i>The Demolitions Committee<br />of Project Mayhem</i>
162389 166974 <i>wrapped the foundation columns of a<br />dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>
167061 169688 <i>In two minutes, primary<br />charges will blow base charges</i>
169772 173231 <i>and a few blocks will be<br />reduced to smoldering rubble.</i>
173734 176351 <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>
176862 180355 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
180449 185990 <i>Suddenly I realize that all of this -<br />the gun, the bombs, the revolution</i>
186080 189539 <i>has got something to do<br />with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>
191377 193744 <i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>
194880 198498 <i>This was a support group<br />for men with testicular cancer.</i>
198592 201926 <i>The big moosie slobbering<br />all over me, that was Bob.</i>
202388 203970 [FLATLY] We're still men.
204431 205967 Yes, we're men.
206475 208261 Men is what we are.
208352 212346 <i>Bob had had his testicles removed.<br />Then hormone therapy.</i>
213148 216026 <i>He developed bitch tits 'cause<br />his testosterone was too high</i>
216110 218192 <i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>
218278 222567 <i>-That was where I fit.</i><br />-They'll have to drain my pecs again.
222658 224524 <i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>
224618 228031 <i>that hung enormous, the<br />way you'd think of God's as big.</i>
228122 230284 Okay, you cry now.
231625 234367 <i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>
235170 237628 <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>
237756 239918 [ECHOING] <i>I couldn't sleep…</i>
240551 242792 <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>
243762 245628 <i>Everything's far away.</i>
245806 249553 <i>Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.</i>
253063 255054 <i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>
255149 258141 <i>it'll be the corporations<br />that name everything.</i>

272166 276785 You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
276879 279556 Prioritize these.<br />Here's your flight coupons.
279640 281419 Call me if there's any snags.

287598 292388 <i>Like so many others, I had become<br />a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>
293020 295850 I'd like to order Erika<br />Pekkari dust ruffles.
295934 297264 WOMAN: <i>Please hold.</i>
297357 300099 <i>If I saw something<br />clever, like a coffee table</i>
300194 303186 <i>in the shape of a<br />yin-yang, I had to have it.</i>
304323 306655 <i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>
306742 309325 <i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>
309411 313120 <i>Or the Ohamshab sofa with<br />the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>
313540 318034 <i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of<br />environmentally friendly unbleached paper.</i>
318545 320456 <i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:</i>
320547 323756 <i>What kind of dining set<br />defines me as a person?</i>
324718 329428 <i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes<br />with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>
329515 331631 <i>proof that they were<br />crafted by the honest,</i>
331725 334308 <i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of..</i>
334394 335944 -WOMAN: <i>Please hold.<br />-…wherever.</i>
338482 340347 <i>We used to read pornography.</i>
340441 342352 <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>
342443 346732 -No. You can't die of insomnia.<br />-What about narcolepsy?
347281 351400 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.<br />I have no idea how I got there.
351494 355488 -You need to lighten up.<br />-Can you please just give me something?
355581 358619 <i>Red and blue Tuinals,<br />lipstick-red Seconals…</i>
359210 362498 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
363256 366544 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
369720 373714 -Hey, come on. I'm in pain.<br />-You wanna see pain?
373808 378598 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.<br />See the guys with testicular cancer.
379272 380808 That's pain.
388197 390905 [CHOIR OF CHILDREN SINGING]
396455 400198 I always wanted three kids.<br />Two boys and a girl.
401085 403543 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
404130 406542 We never could agree on anything.
407884 411127 Well, she had her first child last week.
412096 413302 A girl.
414891 417303 With her… with her new husband.
421606 423563 And thank God. You know?
424233 425974 I-I'm glad for her.
427445 430779 [SOBS] Because she deserves it.
434243 437656 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
437747 439408 ALL: Thank you, Thomas.
439916 443204 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
443502 445539 And that gives me strength.
445630 447746 We give each other strength.
448049 449585 It's time for the one-on-ones.
449675 454340 So let's all of us follow Thomas's<br />example and really open ourselves up.
455181 457218 Could you find a partner?
459810 462393 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>
463856 466644 <i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>
469278 472441 <i>Knees together.<br />Those awkward little steps.</i>
478120 480077 -My name is Bob.<br />-Bob?
480957 483324 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>
483417 486785 <i>You know that chest expansion<br />program on late-night TV?</i>
486879 488244 <i>That was his idea.</i>
488339 489875 [SOBBING] I was a juicer.
490675 492757 You know - using steroids.
494220 497758 Diabonal and…Wisterol.
498265 501803 Oh, they use that on<br />racehorses, for Christ's sakes.
502853 506562 And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced…
508651 513487 My two grown kids won't<br />even return my phone calls.
513572 514812 [SOBS]
514907 518992 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty<br />make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>
521789 523655 Go ahead… Cornelius.
524709 526165 You can cry.
530798 532505 [STARTS SNIVELING]
541100 544843 <i>And then… something happened. I let go.</i>
544937 546678 That's really good.
547023 548730 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>
549191 551432 <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>
553863 555445 <i>I found freedom.</i>
556157 558444 <i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>
560494 561825 BOB [WHISPERS]: It's okay.
565207 567413 <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>
570628 573120 <i>I became addicted.</i>
586895 591480 <i>If I didn't say anything, people<br />always assumed the worst.</i>
595487 599104 <i>They cried harder… then I cried harder.</i>
607832 612042 Now we're going to open the<br />green door, the heart chakra…
612295 614252 <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>
614631 617498 <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>
618134 621843 <i>I was the warm little center that<br />the life of this world crowded around.</i>
622680 626674 Imagine your pain as a<br />white ball of healing light.
627352 630686 It moves over your body, healing you.
631481 634269 Now keep this going. Remember to breathe.
634567 637855 And step forward through<br />the back door of the room.
638863 640570 Where does it lead?
641032 642648 To your cave.
643326 646569 Step forward into your cave.
647539 648995 That's right.
649374 652662 <i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>
653211 658047 [ECHOING] <i>and you're going<br />to find your power animal.</i>

663138 664845 [PENGUIN GIGGLES]
672480 674437 <i>Every evening I died.</i>
675608 678225 <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>
678903 680268 <i>Resurrected.</i>
682991 687155 <i>Bob loved me because he thought<br />my testicles were removed too.</i>
687245 691705 <i>Being there, pressed<br />against his tits, ready to cry.</i>
692292 694249 <i>This was my vacation.</i>
698089 701753 <i>And she… ruined everything.</i>
701843 703709 This is cancer, right?
706931 711266 <i>This chick, Marla Singer,<br />did not have testicular cancer.</i>
711853 713389 <i>She was a liar.</i>
713605 715937 <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>
716191 720059 <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,<br />my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>
720153 723271 <i>Then at Hope, my<br />bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>
724240 727983 <i>And again at Seize The Day,<br />my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>
731289 734122 <i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>
734792 737124 <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>
737295 739878 <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>
739964 744583 <i>I couldn't cry.<br />So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>
756981 759473 <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>
759817 762935 <i>after we open our heart<br />chakras, when it's time to hug,</i>
763029 765896 <i>I'll grab that bitch Marla<br />Singer and scream:</i>
765990 767048 Marla, you liar!
767132 770200 You big tourist!<br />I need this! Now, get out!
771746 773862 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>
774832 775958 [ON TV] <i>We'll just let that dry…</i>
776042 779251 NARRATOR: <i>When you have<br />insomnia, you're never really asleep</i>
779879 782120 <i>and you're never really awake.</i>
784425 788510 To begin tonight's communion,<br />Chloe would like to say a few words.
789639 791926 <i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>
793142 795435 <i>Chloe looked the way Meryl<br />Streep's skeleton would look</i>
795519 799513 <i>if you made it walk around a<br />party being extra nice to everybody.</i>
800190 801976 Well, I'm still here.
802651 804858 But I don't know for how long.
805696 808734 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
809408 811524 But I've got some good news.
812119 814611 I no longer have any fear of death.
818458 822247 But… I am in a pretty lonely place.
823338 825545 No one will have sex with me.
826758 827800 I'm so close to the end,
827884 831047 and all I want is to get<br />laid for the last time.
831888 834596 I have pornographic<br />movies in my apartment,
834683 838051 -and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />-Thank you, Chloe.
839146 841262 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
842733 844519 ALL: Thank you, Chloe.
846445 850154 Now, let's ready ourself<br />for guided meditation.
852409 855447 You're standing at the<br />entrance of your cave.
855954 859163 You step inside your cave and you walk…
859416 862704 <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>
863920 865081 <i>Maria.</i>
865297 867288 <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>
867382 870841 <i>that would heal if you could<br />stop tonguing it, but you can't.</i>
870927 874295 GROUP LEADER: …deeper<br />into your cave as you walk.
875766 879100 [ECHOING] <i>You feel a<br />healing energy all around you.</i>
881188 883270 <i>Now find your power animal.</i>
887736 888976 Slide.
892866 895358 GROUP LEADER: Okay. Let's partner up.
895952 898489 Pick someone special to you tonight.
904628 905709 Hey.
907047 908958 -We need to talk.<br />-Sure.
914346 916053 -I'm onto you.<br />-What?
916139 919131 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
920018 921053 Sorry?
921144 925729 In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia<br />Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
925816 929309 But you're not dying the<br />way Chloe back there is dying.
929653 930643 So?
931405 933146 So you're a tourist.
933615 937904 I've seen you. I saw you at<br />melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis.
937994 940031 I saw you at testicular cancer!
940122 942159 I saw you practicing this.
942332 944448 -Practicing what?<br />-Telling me off.
944543 947535 Is it going as well as you hoped…<br />"Rupert"?
949005 951838 -I'll expose you.<br />-Go ahead. I'll expose you.
951925 954838 GROUP LEADER: Come together.<br />Let yourselves cry.
960851 962307 [MARLA SOBS]
963019 964760 Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
964855 967267 It's cheaper than a<br />movie and coffee's free.
967357 971066 Look, this is important.<br />These are my groups.
971153 973269 I've been coming for over a year.
973363 976355 -Why do you do it?<br />-I don't know.
976450 980284 When people think you're dying,<br />they really listen to you instead of…
980370 983283 Instead of waiting<br />for their turn to speak.
984541 986828 Yeah. Yeah.
987836 990419 Share yourself, completely.
991798 994467 You don't want to get into this.<br />It becomes an addiction.
994551 996792 -Really?<br />-I'm not kidding.
996887 1000300 I can't cry if another faker<br />is present, and I need this.
1000390 1002973 So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
1003059 1006142 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1009149 1011390 Wait a second. Hold on.
1012110 1015899 We'll split up the week, okay?<br />You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1015989 1018658 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1018742 1022154 Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1022244 1024677 Technically, I have<br />more right to be there.
1024761 1026283 You still have your balls.
1026373 1028740 -You're kidding.<br />-I dunno. Am I?
1029084 1030290 No. No.
1030419 1033332 -What do you want?<br />-I'll take the parasites.
1033422 1036164 You can't have both.<br />Take the blood parasites.
1036258 1037840 I want brain parasites.
1037927 1040840 I'll take the blood, but<br />I want brain dementia.
1040930 1043513 -I want that.<br />-You can't have the whole brain.
1043599 1046182 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1046268 1049761 Okay. Take both the parasites.<br />They're yours.
1050356 1052393 Now we both have three…
1056070 1058607 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1058697 1060688 [TIRES SCREECH]
1060783 1062365 [CAR HORN]
1074713 1078707 -What, are you selling those?<br />-Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
1078801 1080883 So, we each have three. That's six.
1080970 1083382 What about the seventh day?<br />I want bowel cancer.
1083472 1085554 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>
1085641 1090511 -No. No. I want bowel cancer.<br />-That's your favorite too?
1091021 1094639 -Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />-Look, we'll split it.
1095025 1098017 Take the first and third<br />Sunday of the month.
1100281 1101362 Deal.
1104118 1107736 -Looks like this is goodbye.<br />-Let's not make a big thing out of it.
1107830 1110447 How's this for not making a big thing?
1114962 1117078 Hey, Marla! Marla!
1119091 1122504 -Maybe we should exchange numbers.<br />-Should we?
1122761 1124968 We might wanna switch nights.
1126181 1127216 Okay.
1132813 1135305 <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>
1136817 1140526 <i>Marla's philosophy of life was<br />that she might die at any moment.</i>
1140613 1143150 <i>The tragedy, she said,<br />was that she didn't.</i>
1143240 1145607 It doesn't have your name! Who are you?
1145701 1148944 Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?
1149038 1151951 Any of the stupid names<br />you give each night?
1154835 1156826 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>
1157421 1159879 <i>SFO. LAX.</i>
1160966 1165381 <i>You wake up at O'Hare.<br />Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>

1170392 1173430 Check-in for that flight<br />isn't for another two hours.
1173520 1177138 <i>This is your life, and it's<br />ending one minute at a time.</i>
1177941 1180979 <i>You wake up at Air Harbor international.</i>
1181862 1185526 <i>If you wake up at a different<br />time, in a different place,</i>
1185949 1188737 <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

1955172 1958665 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.<br />It comes on a few.
1958759 1962127 So someone has to switch the<br />projectors at the exact moment
1962221 1964713 that one reel ends and<br />the next one begins.
1964807 1967174 If you look, you can see little dots come

1972773 1974480 That's the cue for a changeover.
1974567 1979357 He flips the projectors, movie keeps<br />going and the audience has no idea.
1979697 1982189 Why would anyone want this shit job?
1982283 1985071 'Cause it affords him<br />interesting opportunities.

2328586 2332045 It's an article written by<br />an organ in the first person.
2332131 2334463 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
2334550 2336301 "Without me, Jack could not regulate
2336385 2339002 "his heart rate, blood<br />pressure or breathing."

2368417 2370767 TYLER: If you could<br />choose, who would you fight?
2371128 2373165 I'd fight my boss, probably.
2373256 2374417 Really?
2375424 2378758 -Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?<br />-I'd fight my dad.
2379095 2380835 I don't know my dad.
2380929 2384593 I mean, I know him, but he left<br />when I was, like, six years old.
2384683 2387220 Married this other woman<br />and had some other kids.
2387310 2389176 He did this every six years.
2389271 2393936 -He moves city and starts a new family.<br />-Fucker's setting up franchises.
2395819 2399687 My dad never went to college,<br />so it was real important that I go.
2399781 2401192 That sounds familiar.
2401283 2405117 So I graduate. I call him up long<br />distance and say, "Dad, now what?"
2405203 2407365 -He says, "Get a job."<br />-Same here.
2407455 2412120 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.<br />"Dad, now what?"
2412335 2414667 He says, "I dunno. Get married."
2416923 2418789 You can't get married.
2419217 2421083 I'm a 30-year-old boy.

2479694 2482186 Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
2482530 2484817 Because waste is a thief.

2583798 2586586 You do not talk about Fight Club!
2587635 2589046 Third rule of Fight Club:

2633680 2637298 <i>when he trounced the<br />maître d' of a local food court.</i>
2639520 2641146 <i>Sometimes, all you<br />could hear were the flat,</i>

2652741 2655403 <i>You weren't alive anywhere<br />like you were there.</i>
2655494 2660489 <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours<br />between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>
2661416 2663793 <i>Even if I could tell someone<br />they had a good fight,</i>
2663877 2666244 <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

2679059 2681972 If you could fight any<br />celebrity, who would you fight?
2682062 2685180 -Alive or dead?<br />-Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2686275 2688562 Hemingway. You?
2690028 2693066 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2694992 2697780 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>
2698495 2701863 <i>Everywhere we went,<br />we were sizing things up.</i>
2705919 2708456 <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>
2708547 2712586 <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein<br />or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

3394563 3397476 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3397566 3400524 Whoever set this dynamite<br />could have blown out
3400610 3403523 your pilot light days<br />before the explosion.
3403613 3406446 <i>-The gas was just a detonator.</i><br />-Who'd do such a thing?
3406533 3408945 <i>-I'll ask the questions.</i><br />-Tell him.
3409452 3413286 "The liberator who destroyed my<br />property realigned my perceptions."
3413373 3414829 <i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>
3414916 3418409 Yes.<br />It's hard to know what to make of this.
3418503 3420540 Have you recently made enemies
3420630 3422837 who might have access<br />to home-made dynamite?
3422924 3425507 -Enemies?<br />-"I reject civilization,
3425594 3427585 especially material possessions."
3427679 3430296 <i>-Son, this is serious.</i><br />-Yes, I know it's serious.
3430390 3433223 <i>-I mean that.</i><br />-Yes, it's very serious.
3433310 3439101 Look, nobody takes this more seriously<br />than me. That condo was my life. Okay?
3439649 3442357 I loved every stick of<br />furniture in that place.
3442444 3445653 <i>That was not just a bunch<br />of stuff that got destroyed.</i>
3445739 3448231 -It was me!<br />-NARRATOR: <i>I thank the Academy.</i>
3448325 3452569 <i>-Is this not a good time for you?</i><br />-Just tell him you fucking did it!
3452829 3456914 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3457000 3460868 <i>-Are you still there?</i><br />-Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
3460962 3465627 No. I may need to talk to you, so you<br />let me know if you're gonna leave town.
3466426 3467837 <i>-Okay?</i><br />-Okay.
3471473 3472598 <i>Except for their humping,</i>
3472682 3475515 <i>Tyler and Marla were<br />never in the same room.</i>
3475602 3478264 <i>My parents pulled this<br />exact same act for years.</i>
3478355 3481723 The condom is the glass<br />slipper of our generation.
3482692 3485525 You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
3485695 3489404 You dance all night,<br />then you throw it away.
3490408 3493150 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3494537 3495618 What?
3500460 3503293 I got this dress at<br />a thrift store for $1.
3503380 3505166 It was worth every penny.
3505256 3507293 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3509344 3513303 Someone loved it intensely for one day,
3514515 3516097 then tossed it.
3517726 3519558 Like a Christmas tree.
3520104 3521640 So special.
3522940 3524897 Then… bam!
3525776 3527983 It's on the side of the road.
3528529 3530645 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3532616 3539409 Like a sex-crime victim, underwear<br />inside out, bound with electrical tape.
3539915 3541906 Well, then, it suits you.
3542418 3544534 You can borrow it sometime.
3551760 3553250 Get rid of her.
3554096 3556679 -What? You get rid of her!<br />-Don't mention me.
3556765 3560975 <i>I am six years old again, passing<br />messages between parents.</i>
3564356 3567098 -It's time you left.<br />-Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3567192 3572062 -Not that we don't love your visits.<br />-You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
3573866 3577442 <i>Gotta get off</i> Thanks. Bye.
3577536 3582781 <i>Gotta get off of this merry-go-round</i>
3584668 3589287 <i>Gonna get, need to get, gotta get…</i>
3590841 3592798 [TYLER SNIGGERS]
3592968 3594208 You kids!
3595679 3598387 Why do you still waste time with her?
3599808 3602926 I'll say this about Marla.<br />At least she's trying to hit bottom.
3603020 3604431 And I'm not?
3604772 3608481 Sticking feathers up your butt<br />does not make you a chicken.
3608817 3610683 What are we doing tonight?
3610778 3612815 Tonight… we make soap.
3613947 3617190 -Really?<br />-To make soap, first we render fat.
3637513 3638930 The salt balance has to be just right,
3639014 3642097 so the best fat for soap<br />comes from humans.
3642851 3646014 -Wait. What is this place?<br />-A liposuction clinic.
3653904 3655645 Aha! Pay dirt!
3656532 3660366 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />The fat of the land!
3666041 3668874 No! Don't pull it.
3673590 3676002 -Oh, God!<br />-Give me another one.
3683350 3687765 As the fat renders, the tallows float<br />to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
3688147 3691731 -It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.<br />-Keep stirring.
3694111 3697649 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerin.
3697739 3699980 Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
3700075 3704285 If you then add sodium nitrate<br />and sawdust, you got dynamite.
3705289 3708031 With enough soap, one<br />could blow up anything.
3708125 3710787 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>
3710878 3714464 Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner<br />when washed in one part of the river.
3714548 3715879 -You know why?<br />-No.
3720012 3722845 Humans were once<br />sacrificed on the hills above.
3722931 3726640 Bodies burned, water seeped<br />through the ashes to create lye.
3727186 3729177 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3729271 3733811 Once it mixed with the melted body fat,<br />a soapy discharge crept into the river.
3733901 3736188 May I see your hand, please?
3741324 3742610 [KISSES]
3743242 3744573 What is this?
3744660 3747448 -This is a chemical burn.<br />-Agh! Aaagh!
3747538 3750872 It'll hurt more than you've ever<br />been burned and leave a scar.
3750958 3753708 <i>If meditation worked for<br />cancer, it could work for this.</i>
3754128 3756540 -Don't shut the pain out.<br />-Oh, God!
3758549 3760509 The first soap was<br />made from heroes' ashes,
3760593 3762386 like the first monkey shot into space.
3762470 3765588 Without pain or sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3765681 3768423 <i>I tried not to think of the<br />words "searing" or "flesh".</i>
3768517 3771430 Stop it! This is your pain,<br />this is your burning hand.
3771520 3774603 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3774690 3778354 No! Don't deal with this the way<br />those dead people do! Come on!
3778444 3779444 -I get the point!<br />-No!
3779528 3781815 You're feeling premature enlightenment.
3786327 3789121 It's the greatest moment of<br />your life, and you're missing it!
3789205 3790741 I am not…
3791332 3794245 Shut up!<br />Our fathers were our models for God.
3794335 3797202 If our fathers bailed, what<br />does that tell you about God?
3798673 3804009 Listen to me. You have to consider the<br />possibility that God does not like you.
3804136 3807754 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, he hates you.
3807848 3811261 This is not the worst thing that<br />can happen. We don't need him!
3811352 3814515 -I agree!<br />-Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
3814605 3817097 We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
3817191 3821150 -I'm getting water!<br />-You can use water and make it worse or…
3821237 3822773 Look at me!
3822863 3825991 -Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />-Please let me have it, please!
3826075 3828316 First, you have to give up.
3828703 3831195 First, you have to know - not fear
3831455 3834322 know that someday, you're gonna die.
3834417 3836704 You don't know how this feels!
3841590 3845629 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3846387 3847468 Okay.
3847555 3848545 [WHIMPERS]
3863070 3866688 Congratulations.<br />You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
3869827 3873491 <i>Tyler sold his soap to<br />department stores at $20 a bar.</i>
3873581 3875071 <i>God knows what they charged.</i>
3875166 3879000 -This is the best soap.<br />-Why, thank you, Susan.
3879420 3880956 <i>It was beautiful.</i>
3881047 3884756 <i>We were selling rich women<br />their own fat asses back to them.</i>

3894602 3897890 <i>I'm half-asleep again.<br />I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>
3897980 3900472 "The second rule…" Is this yours?

3902443 3905526 Pretend you're me.<br />Make a managerial decision.
3905613 3908025 You find this. What would you do?
3912995 3914906 Well, I gotta tell you,
3915081 3918369 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3918459 3921918 Because the person who<br />wrote that is dangerous.
3922004 3926464 And this button-down,<br />Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap
3926550 3929417 and then stalk from office to office
3929512 3934928 with an Armalite AR10 carbine<br />gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
3935017 3938635 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3940314 3943272 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.

3974139 3975174 What do you mean?
3975265 3978257 I need you to check<br />for a lump in my breast.
3978351 3979398 Go to a hospital.
3979482 3982185 I can't afford to waste<br />money on a doctor.
3982897 3985184 I don't know about this, Marla.

3998705 4003290 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4003376 4005208 -No, no.<br />-I got one for you.
4005295 4007206 Thanks for the thought.
4008548 4010664 What happened to your hand?
4011176 4012541 Oh, nothing.
4014012 4015628 -Right there?<br />-Mm.

4026399 4027810 No, nothing.
4029569 4032061 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

4101391 4105180 The first rule is, I'm not<br />supposed to talk about it.

4268348 4270259 But we won't.
4270350 4273308 We're slowly learning that fact.

4456744 4458485 You too, big guy.
4462541 4464498 We'll see you next week.
4480184 4483802 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4485147 4489391 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4492029 4494145 You're gonna start a fight,
4494740 4496606 and you're gonna lose.
4499370 4501486 Excellent choice, sir.
4502873 4505581 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4505876 4508288 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>
4511799 4513665 What… Son of a bitch!
4513968 4518428 <i>Most people - normal people - do<br />just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>
4520140 4521630 Excuse me!
4521725 4523966 You sprayed me with your hose.
4524061 4525551 That's not necessary.
4525646 4527307 Jay! Go call 911!
4529024 4530059 [SCREAMS]
4530150 4531311 Put the hose down.
4532069 4533901 Stop it! Stop it!
4537199 4538439 Sorry.
4546250 4547331 [GRUNTS] You bastard!
4553590 4555206 We need to talk.
4557928 4559089 Okay.
4561056 4562262 Where to begin?
4562433 4565016 With your constant absenteeism?
4565102 4567969 With your unpresentable appearance?
4568105 4572815 -You're up for review.<br />-I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4572901 4574858 -What?<br />-Let's pretend.
4574945 4577812 You're the Department<br />of Transportation, okay?
4578449 4583535 Someone informs you that this company<br />installs front-seat mounting brackets
4583662 4585778 that never pass collision tests,
4585873 4589036 brake linings that<br />fail after 1,000 miles,
4589126 4592960 and fuel injectors that<br />explode and burn people alive.
4594465 4595796 What then?
4596425 4598757 -Are you threatening me?<br />-No…
4598844 4602178 -Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!<br />-I have a better solution.
4602639 4605677 Keep me on the payroll<br />as an outside consultant
4606226 4607727 and, in exchange for my salary,
4607811 4611679 my job will be never to tell<br />people these things that I know.
4612608 4617227 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4617321 4621565 Who… Who the fuck do you<br />think you are, you crazy little shit?
4626288 4630077 -Security!<br /><i>-I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>
4636632 4637838 Agh!
4639468 4641334 What the hell are you doing?
4645057 4646764 [SPLUTTERS]
4650394 4651759 That hurt.
4654398 4656514 Why would you do that?

4659695 4661060 [CHOKES]
4669872 4671704 What are you doing?
4672208 4674245 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4674377 4677915 <i>For some reason, I thought<br />of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>
4678256 4679417 No!
4704490 4709109 <i>Under and behind and inside<br />everything this man took for granted,</i>
4709203 4712070 <i>something horrible had been growing.</i>
4712582 4716075 Look.<br />Just give me the paychecks, like I asked,
4716169 4718456 and you won't ever see me again.
4718588 4721876 <i>And right then, at our most<br />excellent moment together…</i>
4724385 4725375 [WEEPS]
4725469 4728006 Thank God! Please don't hit me again.

4737523 4741318 <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to<br />have Fight Club every night of the week.</i>
4741402 4742938 [CHEERING]
4744030 4748274 <i>Now, nobody was the center of<br />Fight Club except the two men fighting.</i>
4749160 4752323 <i>The leader walked through<br />the crowd, out in the darkness.</i>

4830700 4835285 There's one in Penns Grove too.<br />Bob even found one up in New Castle.
4835371 4838079 -Did you start that one?<br />-No, I thought you did.
4838165 4839246 No.

6887245 6891239 This is bullshit. This is bullshit!<br />I'm not listening to this.
6891333 6894325 -You are insane!<br />-No. You're insane.
6894419 6897582 And we simply do not<br />have time for this crap.
6899299 6901210 <i>It's called a changeover.</i>
6901301 6905340 <i>The movie goes on, and nobody<br />in the audience has any idea.</i>
6919109 6922727 -Sir! Are you checking out?<br />-Yeah. Bill me.
6922821 6926280 I need you to initial this<br />list of phone calls, please.
6929787 6933496 -When were these made?<br />-Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
6938962 6941294 <i>Have I been going to<br />bed earlier every night?</i>
6941382 6943544 <i>Have I been sleeping later?</i>
6945135 6948048 <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>
6951809 6953391 Is anybody here?
6955813 6958305 <i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>
6959483 6962521 With enough soap, one<br />could blow up anything.
6965280 6966736 Oh, my God.
6968784 6970400 [RINGING TONE]
6970494 6972485 -MAN: <i>1888.</i><br />-Who am I calling?

6986718 6989301 <i>-Hello?</i><br />-Yeah, yeah.
6989847 6992015 I need to talk to your<br />supervisor right away.
6992099 6994056 <i>-Speaking.</i><br />-Okay, listen to me.
6994143 6997226 Something terrible is about<br />to happen to your building.
6997312 6999269 <i>It's under control, sir.</i>
6999982 7003441 -Excuse me?<br /><i>-Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>
7007448 7008529 MAN: <i>2160.</i>
7016957 7019540 Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
7021420 7024003 Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7024089 7026626 Your bald freaks hit<br />me with a fucking broom!
7026717 7028424 They almost broke my arm!
7028510 7030660 They were burning<br />their fingertips with lye.
7032139 7034933 It'll take a tremendous act of<br />faith on your part, but hear me out.
7035017 7038726 -Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />-A little more faith than that.
7043108 7044943 I don't wanna hear<br />anything you have to say.
7045027 7047769 You have every right to be…
7047863 7049447 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7049531 7052023 Sir, anything you order<br />is free of charge, sir.
7053243 7055905 -Why is it free of charge?<br />-[WHISPERS] Don't ask.
7056121 7057361 Whatever.
7057456 7058912 I'll have the clam chowder,
7058999 7062333 fried chicken with a baked<br />potato and chocolate chiffon pie.
7062419 7064501 Clean food, please.
7064588 7067173 In that case, sir, I advise<br />against the clam chowder.
7067257 7069373 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7072012 7074003 MARLA: You got about 30 seconds.
7075641 7078850 I know I've been acting<br />very strange, okay?
7079186 7081678 I know it seems there's two sides to me…
7081772 7083857 Two sides?<br />You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
7083941 7087275 I deserved that.<br />But I realized something important.
7087361 7088567 What?
7088654 7091897 The full extent of our relationship<br />wasn't clear to me until now,
7091990 7094027 for reasons I won't go into.
7094117 7096529 -I know I haven't treated you well.<br />-Whatever.
7096620 7101035 No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!<br />Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
7101583 7103699 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
7103794 7107458 What I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7109633 7111419 -You do?<br />-I really do.
7112177 7116592 I care about you and I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7116682 7119299 Your life is in danger.
7121144 7123977 -What?<br />-You need to leave town for a while.
7124106 7126393 Get out of any major city.<br />Just go camping…
7126483 7128190 You're an insane person.
7128277 7132020 -I've involved you in something terrible.<br />-No. Shut up!
7132114 7134196 -You're not safe.<br />-[YELLS] Shut up!
7136660 7140824 -Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />-I know you did.
7140998 7146163 There are things about you I like.<br />You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
7146836 7149419 But… you're intolerable.
7150089 7153923 You have very serious emotional problems
7154010 7155928 for which you should<br />seek professional help.
7156012 7157379 I know, and I'm sorry.
7157463 7160176 You're sorry, I'm<br />sorry, everyone's sorry.
7161559 7163550 I can't do this anymore.
7164395 7166853 I can't. I won't.
7168733 7170019 I'm gone.
7170985 7173192 You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7176824 7178534 -Marla, you don't understand!<br />-Leave me alone!
7178618 7180825 I am trying to protect you!
7181037 7184200 -I never want to see you again!<br />-If that's what it takes…
7184582 7186323 Wait right here.
7189712 7190668 [HORN BLARES]
7190755 7192712 Hold it right there! Shut up!
7193341 7196760 Take this money and get on this bus.<br />I promise I will never bother you again.
7196844 7197959 [HORN]
7198054 7199340 Shut up!
7199430 7202388 Please get on the bus.<br />Please get on the bus.
7203934 7206767 -Why are you doing this?<br />-They think you're a threat.
7206854 7208970 I can't explain now. Trust me.
7209065 7210983 If I see where you're<br />going, you won't be safe.
7211067 7213684 I'm not paying this back.<br />I consider it asshole tax.
7213778 7217567 Fine. Remember, stay out of major<br />cities for a couple of days, okay?
7217657 7218897 Tyler…
7220409 7222759 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7237635 7240127 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7240805 7243046 I am the leader of a<br />terrorist organization
7243140 7247634 responsible for numerous acts of<br />vandalism and assault all over this city.
7248312 7251771 In the metropolitan area, we<br />had probably 200 members.
7252191 7256185 Chapters have sprung up in five<br />or six other major cities already.
7256278 7259487 This is a tightly regimented organization
7259573 7264113 with many cells capable of operating<br />independent of central leadership.
7265121 7268955 Go to the house, okay? 1537 Paper Street.
7269583 7271199 That's our headquarters.
7271293 7276129 In the back, buried in the garden,<br />you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7277466 7279798 In the basement, you'll<br />find some bathtubs
7279885 7284470 that have been used very recently to<br />make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7285725 7288558 I believe the plan is to<br />blow up the headquarters
7288644 7290476 of these credit-card companies
7290563 7292349 and the TRW building.
7294108 7297476 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit-card companies?
7297862 7301275 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7302158 7304240 You'll create total chaos.
7306787 7309779 Keep him talking.<br />I need to make a phone call.
7319925 7322337 I really admire what you're doing.
7323512 7326220 -What?<br />-You're a brave man to order this.
7327183 7328969 You're a genius, sir.
7329059 7333053 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7334190 7335726 we gotta get his balls.
7336859 7340318 -Don't fight.<br />-It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
7340404 7343567 -It'll set quite an example.<br />-You're making a big mistake!
7343657 7345867 -You said you'd say that.<br />-I'm not Tyler Durden!
7345951 7348238 You told us you'd say that too.
7348788 7350779 All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7350873 7353463 Listen to me.<br />I'm giving you a direct order.
7353547 7355492 We're aborting this mission now.
7355586 7358294 You said you would definitely say that.
7360090 7361626 [MUFFLED] Let me go!
7362885 7366549 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7368348 7369804 Is somebody timing this?
7369891 7371677 Keep your mouth shut.
7371768 7372883 [KNOCKING]
7372977 7374058 Shit!
7377732 7380724 -Some of this information checks out.<br />-Uh-huh?
7381110 7383977 -Let's go to that house on Paper Street.<br />-Be right there.
7384072 7385233 [DOOR CLOSES]
7385323 7386404 Hey, wait!
7386574 7387814 -You got him?<br />-I got him.
7387909 7389525 Sir, we have to do this.
7389619 7392361 -Stop fighting!<br />-Where's the rubber band?
7392455 7395447 Get away from me!<br />Drop that fucking knife!
7398503 7402041 Back up.<br />Face down on the floor right now!
7404175 7406041 Get down on the floor!

7507487 7510489 What the fuck are you doing,<br />running around in your underpants?
7510573 7512359 You look crazy!
7512450 7515442 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7515536 7520326 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. It'll be like Pay-per-view.
7521709 7523074 [LAUGHS]
7567922 7568912 [REGULAR BEEPING]
7569007 7570293 Oh, Christ.
7570383 7572215 Now what are you doing?
7572301 7574383 -I'm stopping this.<br />-Why?
7574929 7578718 -The greatest thing you've ever done.<br />-I can't let this happen.
7578808 7581108 There are 10 other<br />bombs in 10 other buildings.
7581519 7583635 Since when is Project<br />Mayhem about murder?
7583730 7588975 The buildings are empty. We're not<br />killing anyone. We're setting them free!
7589068 7591856 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7592488 7594573 You wanna make an<br />omelet, you gotta break eggs.
7594657 7597944 No. I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7605333 7609247 Wouldn't do that.<br />Not unless I knew which wires were what.
7609337 7611294 If you know, then I know.
7616636 7621472 Or… maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />all day thinking about the wrong ones.
7629858 7631189 You think?
7632527 7635064 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7635155 7637613 Pull any one but the green one.
7638492 7640199 [BEEPING STOPS]
7642704 7645162 I asked you not to do that!
7647501 7648662 TYLER: Fuck!

7690752 7693460 Aw, come on! Don't go!
7732586 7733667 What?
7779299 7782837 Three minutes. This is it.
7783178 7785294 The beginning.

7794231 7795346 I'm sorry?
7795440 7797807 I still can't think of anything.
7799152 7801063 Ah. Flashback humor.
7806910 7809117 It's getting exciting now.
7810497 7813990 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
7815919 7820004 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7820173 7823130 One step closer to economic equilibrium.
7837940 7840648 -Why is she here?<br />-Tying up loose ends.
7841402 7844190 Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
7844905 7849274 -I beg you, please don't do this.<br />-I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
7849368 7852360 -This is what we want.<br />-No. I don't want this.
7852538 7857283 Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.<br />We have to forget about you.
7858210 7861123 -You're a voice in my head.<br />-You're a voice in mine!
7861213 7864797 -Why can't I get rid of you?<br />-You need me.
7864883 7867215 No. I don't. I really don't anymore.
7867303 7871388 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make me feel better.
7871598 7873965 -Take some responsibility.<br />-I do.
7874059 7877552 I am responsible for all<br />of it, and I accept that.
7877646 7881230 So, please, I'm begging<br />you, please call this off.
7883736 7885693 Have I ever let us down?
7887364 7890072 How far have you come because of me?
7895539 7897621 I will bring us through this.
7897708 7901542 As always, I will carry<br />you kicking and screaming,
7901670 7904128 and in the end you will thank me.

7947299 7950087 Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
7958310 7961098 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
