124124 127293 <i>People always ask me</i><br /><i>if I know Tyler Durden.</i>
127560 129162 Three minutes.
129295 131598 This is it. Ground zero.
131731 135268 Want to say a few words<br />for the occasion?
135401 138771 <i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,</i><br /><i>you speak only in vowels.</i>
138905 140440 I can't think of anything.
140573 144611 <i>For a second, I forget about</i><br /><i>Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>
144744 146746 <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>
146880 148882 It's getting exciting now.
149215 152285 <i>That old saying,</i><br /><i>how you always hurt the one you love </i>-
152418 154354 <i>well, it works both ways.</i>
154487 158625 <i>We have front-row seats</i><br /><i>for this theater of mass destruction.</i>
158758 161261 <i>The Demolitions Committee</i><br /><i>of Project Mayhem</i>
161394 165598 <i>wrapped the foundation columns of</i><br /><i>a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>
165732 168535 <i>In two minutes,</i><br /><i>primary charges will blow base charges</i>
168668 172605 <i>and a few square blocks will be reduced</i><br /><i>to smoldering rubble.</i>
172739 175708 <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>
175842 179279 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
179412 184651 <i>Suddenly I realize that all of this </i>-<br /><i>the gun, the bombs, the revolution </i>-
184784 188488 <i>has got something to do</i><br /><i>with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>
190356 192859 <i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>
193192 197263 <i>This was a support group</i><br /><i>for men with testicular cancer.</i>
197397 200600 <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,</i><br /><i>that was Bob.</i>
201367 202769 We're still men.
202902 205204 {\an8}Yes, we're men.
205338 207407 {\an8}Men is what we are.
207540 211778 <i>Bob had had his testicles removed.</i><br /><i>Then hormone therapy.</i>
211911 214881 <i>He developed bitch tits</i><br /><i>cos his testosterone was too high</i>
215215 216916 <i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>
217250 221321 - That was where I fit.<br />- They'll have to drain my pecs again.
221454 223389 <i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>
223523 226759 <i>that hung enormous,</i><br /><i>the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>
226893 229896 OK, you cry now.
230230 233499 <i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>
233933 236603 <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>
236736 239305 <i>I couldn't sleep...</i>
239439 241574 <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>
242609 244477 <i>Everything's far away.</i>
244611 246879 <i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>
247013 249015 <i>of a copy.</i>
251884 256856 <i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i><br /><i>it'll be corporations that name everything.</i>
256990 259359 <i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

261661 263663 <i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>
264330 267333 I need you out of town this week<br />to cover some red flags.
267467 270870 <i>It must have been Tuesday.</i><br /><i>He had on his cornflower-blue tie.</i>
271004 275642 You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
275775 280380 Prioritize these. Here's your flight<br />coupons. Call me if there's any snags.
280513 284350 <i>He was full of pep.</i><br /><i>Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>
286519 291758 <i>Like so many others, I had become</i><br /><i>a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>
291891 296362 - I'd like Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.<br />- Please hold.
296496 301968 <i>If I saw something clever, a coffee table in</i><br /><i>the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.</i>
303002 305471 {\an8}<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>
305605 308007 {\an8}<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>
308341 312011 {\an8}<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa</i><br /><i>with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>
312345 317350 {\an8}<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of</i><br /><i>environmentally friendly paper.</i>
317483 323389 {\an8}<i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:</i><br /><i>"What kind of dining set defines me?"</i>
323523 328094 <i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes</i><br /><i>with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>
328428 333433 <i>proof they were crafted by the honest,</i><br /><i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>
333566 336502 - <i>Please hold.</i><br />- ..<i>wherever.</i>
336903 338971 <i>We used to read pornography.</i>
339105 341107 <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>
341441 346012 - No. You can't die from insomnia.<br />- What about narcolepsy?
346345 349982 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.<br />I have no idea how I got there.
350116 353953 - You need to lighten up.<br />- Can you please give me something?
354087 357757 <i>Red and blue Tuinals,</i><br /><i>lipstick-red Seconals...</i>
357890 362061 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
362395 365732 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
368768 372505 - Hey, come on. I'm in pain.<br />- You wanna see pain?
372638 377777 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesdays.<br />See the guys with testicular cancer.
377910 379946 That's pain.
395394 399398 I always wanted three kids.<br />Two boys and a girl.
399866 402835 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
402969 405705 We never could agree on anything.
406739 410777 Well, she had her first child last week.
410910 412945 A girl.
413780 416149 With her... with her new husband.
420520 422922 And thank God. You know?
423055 424724 I-I'm glad for her.
426125 429896 Because she deserves it.
432965 436068 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
436202 438638 Thank you, Thomas.
438771 441808 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
441941 443943 And that gives me strength.
444076 446479 We give each other strength.
446612 448548 It's time for the one-on-ones.
448681 453786 So let's all of us follow Thomas's<br />example and really open ourselves up.
453920 456489 Could you find a partner?
458658 461227 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>
462728 466132 <i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>
468067 471537 <i>Knees together.</i><br /><i>Those awkward little steps.</i>
476876 479245 - My name is Bob.<br />- Bob?
479579 481981 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>
482114 485551 <i>You know that chest expansion</i><br /><i>program on late-night TV?</i>
485685 487053 <i>That was his idea.</i>
487186 489622 I was a juicer.
489755 492892 You know - using steroids.
493025 496996 Diabonal and... Wisterol.
497129 501534 Oh, they use that on racehorses,<br />for Chrissakes.
501667 505938 And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
507273 512278 my two grown kids<br />won't even return my phone calls.
513746 518117 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty</i><br /><i>make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>
520653 523256 Go ahead... Cornelius.
523589 525625 You can cry.
539939 543976 <i>And then... something happened.</i><br /><i>I let go.</i>
544110 545778 That's really good.
545912 547747 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>
547880 550850 <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>
552718 554887 <i>I found freedom.</i>
555021 558291 <i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>
559225 561294 It's OK.
563696 566165 <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>
569569 572038 <i>I became addicted.</i>
585785 590656 <i>If I didn't say anything,</i><br /><i>people always assumed the worst.</i>
594360 597597 <i>They cried harder... then I cried harder.</i>
606639 611043 Now we're going to open the green door,<br />the heart chakra...
611177 613212 <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>
613346 616949 <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>
617083 620953 <i>I was the warm little center that</i><br /><i>the life of this world crowded around.</i>
621387 626025 Imagine your pain<br />as a white ball of healing light.
626158 630062 It moves over your body, healing you.
630196 633199 Now keep this going.<br />Remember to breathe.
633332 637169 And step forward<br />through the back door of the room.
637303 639739 Where does it lead?
639872 641974 To your cave.
642108 645911 Step forward into your cave.
646045 648047 That's right.
648180 652184 <i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>
652318 656689 <i>and you're going to find</i><br /><i>your power animal.</i>
658791 660059 Slide.
671137 673205 <i>Every evening I died.</i>
674340 677443 <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>
677777 679812 <i>Resurrected.</i>
681814 685985 <i>Bob loved me because he thought</i><br /><i>my testicles were removed too.</i>
686118 691023 <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i><br /><i>ready to cry.</i>
691157 693793 <i>This was my vacation.</i>
696929 700299 <i>And she... ruined everything.</i>
700433 702735 This is cancer, right?
705471 710409 <i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i><br /><i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>
710743 712745 <i>She was a liar.</i>
712878 714880 <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>
715014 718784 <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,</i><br /><i>my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>
718918 722755 <i>Then at Hope,</i><br /><i>my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>
722888 727827 <i>And again at Seize The Day,</i><br /><i>my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>
730129 733365 <i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>
733499 736068 <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>
736202 738871 <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>
739004 744743 <i>I couldn't cry.</i><br /><i>So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>
755855 758424 <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>
758757 761794 <i>after we open our heart chakras,</i><br /><i>when it's time to hug,</i>
761927 764296 <i>I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer</i><br /><i>and scream:</i>
764430 768400 Marla, you liar! You big tourist!<br />I need this! Now, get out!
770469 772938 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>
773072 774907 <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>
775040 778477 {\an8}<i>When you have insomnia,</i><br /><i>you're never really asleep</i>
778811 781013 {\an8}<i>and you're never really awake.</i>
783182 788387 To begin tonight's communion,<br />Chloe would like to say a few words.
788521 790556 <i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>
791790 794560 <i>Chloe looked the way</i><br /><i>Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>
794894 798931 <i>if you made it walk around a party</i><br /><i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>
799064 801300 Well, I'm still here.
801433 804270 But I don't know for how long.
804403 808107 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
808240 810910 But I've got some good news.
811043 813946 I no longer have any fear of death.
817316 821120 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
822154 824456 No one will have sex with me.
825357 830362 I'm so close to the end, and all I want<br />is to get laid for the last time.
830496 833899 I have pornographic movies<br />in my apartment,
834033 837937 - and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />- Thank you, Chloe.
838070 840906 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
841040 843842 Thank you, Chloe.
845244 849348 Now, let's ready ourself<br />for guided meditation.
851183 854520 You're standing<br />at the entrance of your cave.
854853 857890 You step inside your cave<br />and you walk...
858023 862328 <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>
862461 864096 <i>Marla.</i>
864230 866232 <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>
866365 869602 <i>that would heal if you could stop</i><br /><i>tonguing it, but you can't.</i>
869935 874506 ..deeper into your cave as you walk.
874640 878944 <i>You feel</i><br /><i>a healing energy all around you.</i>
879979 883015 <i>Now find your power animal.</i>
886418 887987 Slide.
891891 894660 OK. Let's partner up.
894994 897229 Pick someone special to you tonight.
903402 904937 Hey.
905971 908040 - We need to talk.<br />- Sure.
913212 914914 - I'm onto you.<br />- What?
915047 918617 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
918951 919985 Sorry?
920119 924523 In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia<br />Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
924657 928260 But you're not dying<br />the way Chloe back there is dying.
928394 930129 So?
930262 932264 So you're a tourist.
932398 936602 I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,<br />I saw you at tuberculosis.
936936 938938 I saw you at testicular cancer!
939071 941073 I saw you practicing this.
941206 943142 - Practicing what?<br />- Telling me off.
943275 947112 Is it going as well as you hoped...<br />"Rupert"?
947680 950582 - I'll expose you.<br />- Go ahead. I'll expose you.
950716 954653 Come together. Let yourselves cry.
961660 966231 - Oh, God. Why are you doing this?<br />- Cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.
966365 971637 Look, this is important. These are my<br />groups. I've been coming for over a year.
971971 975074 - Why do you do it?<br />- I don't know.
975207 979078 When people think you're dying,<br />they really listen to you instead of...
979211 982314 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
983349 985751 Yeah. Yeah.
986552 989455 Share yourself, completely.
990289 993359 You don't want to get into this.<br />It becomes an addiction.
993492 995661 - Really?<br />- I'm not kidding.
995995 999098 I can't cry if another faker is present,<br />and I need this.
999231 1001667 So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
1002001 1005437 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1007740 1010242 Wait a second. Hold on.
1010376 1014446 We'll split up the week, OK?<br />You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1014580 1017516 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1017649 1021186 Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1021320 1025090 Technically, I have more right to be<br />there. You still have your balls.
1025224 1028060 - You're kidding.<br />- I dunno. Am I?
1028193 1029495 No. No.
1029628 1032264 - What do you want?<br />- I'll take the parasites.
1032398 1035167 You can't have both.<br />Take the blood parasites.
1035300 1039505 - I want brain parasites.<br />- I'll take blood, I want brain dementia.
1039638 1042374 - I want that.<br />- You can't have the whole brain.
1042508 1045044 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1045177 1049048 OK. Take both the parasites.<br />They're yours.
1049181 1051383 Now we both have three...
1055054 1057389 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1073305 1077543 - What, are you selling those?<br />- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
1077676 1082281 We each have three. That's six. What about<br />the seventh day? I want bowel cancer.
1082414 1084416 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>
1084550 1089688 - No. No. I want bowel cancer.<br />- That's your favorite too?
1089822 1093725 - Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />- Look, we'll split it.
1093859 1097129 Take the first and third Sunday<br />of the month.
1099198 1101266 Deal.
1102835 1106572 - Looks like this is goodbye.<br />- Let's not make a big thing out of it.
1106705 1109274 How's this for not making a big thing?
1113745 1116281 Hey, Marla! Marla!
1117816 1121353 - Maybe we should exchange numbers.<br />- Should we?
1121487 1123589 We might wanna switch nights.
1124823 1126225 OK.
1131630 1133799 <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>
1135567 1139371 <i>Marla's philosophy of life</i><br /><i>was that she might die at any moment.</i>
1139505 1141840 <i>The tragedy, she said,</i><br /><i>was that she didn't.</i>
1142174 1144543 It doesn't have your name!<br />Who are you?
1144676 1150415 Cornelius? Rupert? Travis? Any of<br />the stupid names you give each night?
1153652 1156221 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>
1156355 1158524 <i>SFO. LAX.</i>
1159658 1165230 <i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i><br /><i>Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>
1165364 1168934 <i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.</i><br /><i>Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>
1169268 1172371 Check-in for that flight<br />isn't for another two hours.
1172504 1176408 <i>This is your life,</i><br /><i>and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>
1176542 1179511 <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>
1180846 1184683 <i>If you wake up at a different time,</i><br /><i>in a different place,</i>
1184816 1187519 <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>
1188587 1191890 <i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>
1192224 1196562 <i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving</i><br /><i>cream, single pat of butter.</i>
1197262 1199464 <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>
1199598 1205470 <i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample</i><br /><i>package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>
1206838 1211643 <i>The people I meet on each flight,</i><br /><i>they're single-serving friends.</i>
1212644 1217683 <i>Between takeoff and landing, we have</i><br /><i>our time together, but that's all we get.</i>
1217816 1219718 <i>Welcome!</i>
1221587 1225891 <i>On a long enough time line, the</i><br /><i>survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>
1226225 1229761 <i>I was a recall coordinator.</i><br /><i>My job was to apply the formula.</i>
1229895 1232998 The infant went through the windshield.<br />Three points.
1233332 1237369 <i>A new car built by my company</i><br /><i>leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>
1237502 1239571 <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>
1239705 1244676 The teenager's braces are stuck to the<br />ashtray. Make a good anti-smoking ad.
1244810 1247813 <i>The car crashes and burns</i><br /><i>with everyone trapped inside.</i>
1247946 1250649 <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>
1250782 1256021 Father must've been huge. See where the<br />fat burned to the seat? Polyester shirt?
1256355 1257856 Very modern art.
1257990 1260759 <i>Take the number of vehicles</i><br /><i>in the field, A.</i>
1260892 1263595 <i>Multiply it by the probable rate</i><br /><i>of failure, B.</i>

1267633 1269735 <i>A x B x C...</i>
1269868 1271370 equals X.
1271503 1276642 If X is less than the cost of a recall,<br />we don't do one.
1277476 1281847 - Are there a lot of these accidents?<br />- You wouldn't believe.
1283515 1285884 Which car company do you work for?
1286985 1289054 A major one.
1290589 1294493 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply</i><br /><i>on takeoff or landing,</i>
1294626 1297996 <i>I prayed for a crash</i><br /><i>or a midair collision.</i>
1298330 1299931 <i>Anything.</i>
1308907 1312678 <i>Life insurance pays off triple</i><br /><i>if you die on a business trip.</i>
1315647 1319685 "If you are seated<br />in an emergency exit row
1319818 1324589 and feel unable or unwilling to perform<br />the duties listed on the safety card,
1324723 1328994 please ask a flight attendant<br />to reseat you."
1329328 1333065 - It's a lot of responsibility.<br />- Wanna switch seats?
1333398 1336702 No. I'm not sure<br />I'm the man for that particular job.
1336835 1341073 An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet.<br />Mm-hm.
1341406 1343975 The illusion of safety.
1344109 1346645 Yeah. I guess so.
1346778 1349481 You know why<br />they put oxygen masks on planes?
1349614 1353418 - So you can breathe.<br />- Oxygen gets you high.
1354519 1357923 In a catastrophic emergency,<br />you take giant panic breaths.
1358056 1363528 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.<br />You accept your fate.
1363662 1365697 It's all right here.
1366465 1368834 Emergency water landing, 600mph.
1368967 1371837 Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
1372704 1375006 That's, um...
1375140 1377542 That's an interesting theory.
1379878 1382414 - What do you do?<br />- What do you mean?
1382547 1386985 - What do you do for a living?<br />- So you can pretend you're interested?
1389721 1391056 OK.
1391389 1394059 You have a kind of<br />sick desperation in your laugh.
1397462 1399531 We have the exact same briefcase.
1401032 1402167 Soap.
1402501 1406004 - Sorry?<br />- I make and I sell soap.
1406138 1408940 The yardstick of civilization.
1409074 1410976 <i>And this is how I met...</i>
1411109 1412911 "Tyler Durden."
1413044 1418183 You know if you mix gasoline and frozen<br />orange juice, you can make napalm?
1418517 1421419 - No, I did not. Is that true?<br />- That's right.
1421553 1424990 One can make all kinds of explosives<br />using simple household items.
1425123 1427826 - Really?<br />- If one were so inclined.
1432798 1437869 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting<br />single-serving friend I've ever met.
1439471 1443842 - Everything on a plane's single-serving.<br />- Oh, I get it. Very clever.
1443975 1445610 Thank you.
1446444 1448547 How's that working out for you?
1448680 1450649 - What?<br />- Being clever.
1451716 1456054 - Great.<br />- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
1457189 1462594 Now, a question of etiquette. As I pass,<br />do I give you the ass or the crotch?
1469634 1471870 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>
1472003 1476174 <i>Airlines have this policy</i><br /><i>about vibrating luggage.</i>
1483882 1485217 Was it ticking?
1485550 1488620 Throwers don't worry.<br />Modern bombs don't tick.
1488753 1491857 - Sorry. Throwers?<br />- Baggage handlers.
1492724 1496928 But when a suitcase vibrates,<br />the throwers have to call the police.
1497062 1499531 My suitcase was vibrating?
1499664 1505136 Nine times out of ten it's an electric<br />razor, but... every once in a while...
1507873 1509941 it's a dildo.
1510742 1514779 It's company policy never to imply<br />ownership in the event of a dildo.
1514913 1520886 We have to use the indefinite article -<br />"a dildo", never "your dildo".
1521019 1523054 I don't own...
1525790 1532097 <i>I had everything in that suitcase. My</i><br /><i>CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>
1533832 1536101 <i>Never mind.</i>
1538003 1540772 Hey! That's my car!
1547612 1552717 <i>Home was on the 15th floor of a filing</i><br /><i>cabinet for widows, young professionals.</i>
1552851 1554853 <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>
1554986 1558623 <i>A foot of concrete's important</i><br /><i>when your next-door neighbor</i>
1558757 1561259 <i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>
1561593 1565230 <i>Or when a blast of debris</i><br /><i>that used to be your personal effects</i>
1565563 1569567 <i>blows out of your windows</i><br /><i>and sails flaming into the night.</i>
1575941 1578176 <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>
1591056 1593091 There's... nothing up there.
1593224 1596695 You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
1605236 1608606 Do you have somebody you can call?
1608740 1613011 <i>How embarrassing.</i><br /><i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>
1623121 1630128 <i>Police later told me the pilot light might</i><br /><i>have gone out, letting out a bit of gas.</i>
1630261 1635033 <i>That could have slowly filled the condo</i><br /><i>- 1700 square feet with high ceilings </i>-
1635166 1637035 <i>for days and days.</i>
1644275 1648113 <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor</i><br /><i>could have clicked on.</i>
1649881 1651249 <i>Yeah?</i>
1654319 1657088 <i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>
1666264 1670135 <i>If you ask me now,</i><br /><i>I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>
1712277 1714446 - Hello?<br />- <i>Who's this?</i>
1716414 1718883 - Tyler?<br />- <i>Who is this?</i>
1719017 1720251 Um...
1720385 1722487 We met... we met on the airplane.
1722821 1725356 We had the same suitcase?
1725490 1729461 - Uh... the clever guy.<br />- <i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>
1731463 1735366 I called a second ago. There was<br />no answer. I'm at a payphone.
1735500 1738770 <i>Yeah, I *69'd you.</i><br /><i>I never pick up my phone.</i>
1741239 1743308 - <i>So what's up?</i><br />- Uh...
1744042 1746044 Well...
1746177 1748146 You're not gonna believe this.
1750782 1752450 It could be worse.
1752784 1757155 A woman could cut off your penis<br />while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
1757288 1759457 There's always that.
1759791 1762794 It's just, when you buy furniture,<br />you tell yourself:
1762927 1768833 "That's the last sofa I'll need. Whatever<br />happens, I got that sofa problem handled."
1768967 1772270 I had it all.<br />I had a stereo that was very decent.
1772403 1775106 A wardrobe that was getting<br />very respectable.
1775240 1777876 I was close to being complete.
1778009 1781946 - Shit, man. And now it's all gone.<br />- All gone.
1782080 1783782 All gone.
1785316 1788052 Do you know what a duvet is?
1788186 1791456 - A comforter.<br />- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
1791790 1794025 Why do guys like us know<br />what a duvet is?
1794159 1798429 Is this essential to our survival<br />in the hunter-gatherer sense?
1798563 1800298 No.
1800431 1804803 - What are we, then?<br />- I dunno. Consumers.
1804936 1806938 Right. We're consumers.
1807071 1810842 We are by-products of a lifestyle<br />obsession.
1810975 1814479 Murder, crime, poverty.<br />These things don't concern me.
1814813 1817849 What concerns me are celebrity<br />magazines,
1817982 1819984 television with 500 channels,
1820118 1822120 some guy's name on my underwear.
1822253 1824923 Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
1825056 1827859 - Martha Stewart.<br />- Fuck Martha Stewart.
1827992 1831329 She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.<br />It's all going down.
1831462 1835967 So fuck off with your sofa units<br />and Strinne green stripe patterns.
1836100 1838503 I say never be complete.
1838837 1840605 I say stop being perfect.
1840939 1842907 I say let's evolve.
1843041 1845243 Let the chips fall where they may.
1847378 1851549 But that's me, and I could be wrong.<br />Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
1851883 1854219 It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.
1854352 1858089 You did lose a lot of versatile solutions<br />for modern living.
1858223 1861459 Fuck, you're right.<br />No, I don't smoke.
1864162 1867966 My insurance is probably gonna cover it,<br />so...
1871402 1875607 - What?<br />- Things you own end up owning you.
1879077 1881145 But do what you like, man.
1881913 1884282 Oh, it's late.
1885316 1887986 - Hey, thanks for the beer.<br />- Yeah, man.
1888119 1890221 I should find a hotel.
1890355 1892523 - Oh!<br />- What?
1892657 1893892 What?
1894025 1895994 - A hotel?<br />- Yeah.
1896127 1899130 - Just ask, man.<br />- What are you talking about?
1899264 1903534 Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer<br />and you still can't ask.
1905503 1908306 - What?<br />- You called cos you need a place to stay.
1908439 1911910 - Oh, hey. No, no, no.<br />- Yes, you did. So just ask.
1912043 1914479 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
1916314 1918483 Would... would that be a problem?
1918616 1921019 Is it a problem for you to ask?
1922053 1925323 - Can I stay at your place?<br />- Yeah.
1926090 1928159 Thanks.
1931529 1934499 - I want you to do me a favor.<br />- Yeah, sure.
1934632 1937168 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1938102 1943374 - What?<br />- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1943508 1946077 <i>Let me tell you a little</i><br /><i>about Tyler Durden.</i>
1947045 1950982 Tyler was a night person.<br />While the rest of us slept, he worked.
1951115 1954185 He had one part-time job<br />as a projectionist.
1954319 1957255 A movie doesn't come all on<br />one big reel. It comes on a few.
1957388 1961092 So someone has to switch the projectors<br />at the exact moment
1961225 1963528 that one reel ends<br />and the next one begins.
1963661 1968366 If you look, you can see little dots come<br />into the upper right corner of the screen.
1968499 1971402 In the industry,<br />we call them cigarette burns.
1971536 1973338 That's the cue for a changeover.
1973471 1978409 He flips the projectors, movie keeps<br />going and the audience has no idea.
1978543 1983715 - Why would anyone want this shit job?<br />- It affords him interesting opportunities.
1984048 1987151 Like splicing a frame of pornography<br />into family films.
1987285 1993224 When the snooty cat and the courageous<br />dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
1993358 1996761 you'll catch a flash<br />of Tyler's contribution to the film.
2003634 2009040 - Nobody knows they saw it, they did.<br />- A nice big cock.
2013678 2016514 Even a hummingbird<br />couldn't catch Tyler at work.
2021753 2026791 Tyler also worked sometimes as a<br />banquet waiter at the Pressman Hotel.
2031529 2035533 He was the guerrilla terrorist<br />of the food service industry.
2035666 2038036 Do not watch.<br />I cannot go when you watch.
2038169 2042707 Apart from seasoning lobster bisque, he<br />farted on meringues, sneezed on endives...
2043041 2045143 As for the cream of mushroom soup...
2045276 2049313 - Go ahead, tell 'em.<br />- You get the idea.
2049580 2052650 - You just want me to hit you?<br />- Come on. Do me this one favor.
2052784 2056220 - Why?<br />- Don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
2056354 2060291 - No. But that's a good thing.<br />- You can't know yourself if you haven't.
2060425 2062627 I don't wanna die without any scars.
2062760 2067198 - Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.<br />- Oh, God. This is crazy.
2067331 2069434 So go crazy! Let it rip.
2069567 2072236 - I don't know about this.<br />- I don't either.
2072370 2075373 Who gives a shit? No one's watching.<br />What do you care?
2075506 2077809 This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
2078142 2080144 That's right.
2080278 2083414 - Where? Like, in the face?<br />- Surprise me.
2085550 2087618 This is so fucking stupid.
2098529 2102767 Motherfucker!<br />You hit me in the ear!
2103101 2106204 - Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.<br />- Ow! Christ!
2106337 2107705 Why the ear, man?
2107839 2110174 - I fucked it up.<br />- No, that was perfect.
2110308 2112543 Ugh! Agh!
2123121 2125223 No, it's all right.
2125890 2128426 It really hurts.
2128559 2130595 Right.
2130862 2135399 - Hit me again.<br />- No, you hit me. Come on!
2152350 2154752 We should do this again sometime.
2167598 2169767 - Where's your car?<br />- What car?
2180378 2184916 <i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,</i><br /><i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>
2185249 2187885 <i>It looked like it was waiting</i><br /><i>to be torn down.</i>
2188219 2190488 <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>
2190621 2195826 <i>There was no lock on the front door from</i><br /><i>when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>
2195960 2197962 <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

2204268 2206304 Yep. That's you.
2206437 2208839 That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
2208973 2211676 Yeah, thanks.
2211809 2214545 <i>What a shithole.</i>
2214679 2216847 <i>Nothing worked.</i>
2219217 2222687 <i>Turning on one light meant</i><br /><i>another light in the house went out.</i>

2232463 2234765 Hey. What have we here?

2330895 2332897 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
2333030 2337802 "Without me, Jack could not regulate his<br />heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."
2337935 2339937 There's a whole series of these.
2340071 2344508 "I Am Jill's Nipples."<br />"I Am Jack's Colon."
2344642 2347578 Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
2348846 2350681 Whoop! Agh!
2350815 2354752 <i>After fighting, everything else in life</i><br /><i>got the volume turned down.</i>
2354885 2358356 What?

2367431 2369967 If you could choose,<br />who would you fight?
2370101 2371869 I'd fight my boss, probably.
2372002 2374004 Really?
2374138 2377808 - Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?<br />- I'd fight my dad.
2377942 2379710 I don't know my dad.
2379844 2383614 I mean, I know him, but he left<br />when I was, like, six years old.
2383748 2388052 Married this other woman and had some<br />other kids. He did this every six years.
2388386 2393023 - He moves city and starts a new family.<br />- Fucker's setting up franchises.
2394658 2398462 My dad never went to college,<br />so it was real important that I go.
2398596 2399930 That sounds familiar.
2400064 2403901 So I graduate. I call him up long-<br />distance and say, "Dad, now what?"
2404034 2406170 - He says, "Get a job."<br />- Same here.
2406504 2411041 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.<br />"Dad, now what?"
2411175 2413711 He says, "I dunno. Get married."

2449079 2453784 <i>It used to be when I came home angry</i><br /><i>or depressed, I'd just clean my condo,</i>
2453918 2455920 <i>polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>
2456053 2461025 <i>I should've been looking for a new condo,</i><br /><i>haggling with my insurance company.</i>
2461158 2466530 <i>I should have been upset about</i><br /><i>my nice flaming little shit - but I wasn't.</i>
2466664 2470534 The premise of cybernetting an office<br />is make things more efficient.
2470668 2473671 <i>Monday mornings,</i><br /><i>all I thought about was next week.</i>
2473804 2476774 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
2476907 2477942 Absolutely.
2478075 2481212 Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
2481545 2484148 Because waste is a thief.
2484482 2487518 I showed this to my man here.<br />You liked it, didn't you?
2491655 2495826 <i>You can swallow a pint of blood</i><br /><i>before you get sick.</i>
2496560 2500631 <i>It was right in everyone's face.</i><br /><i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>
2500764 2505669 <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i><br /><i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>
2516580 2519683 Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
2540838 2543941 Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
2564995 2568332 <i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules</i><br /><i>that he and I decided.</i>
2568666 2570634 Gentlemen!
2570768 2572803 Welcome to Fight Club.
2574905 2579577 The first rule of Fight Club is<br />you do not talk about Fight Club.
2579710 2582580 The second rule of Fight Club is...
2582713 2586016 you do not talk about Fight Club!
2586150 2591221 Third rule of Fight Club:<br />someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
2591355 2593624 the fight is over.
2593757 2596627 Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
2596760 2601198 Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
2601332 2603867 Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
2604001 2608806 Seventh rule: fights will go on<br />as long as they have to.
2610774 2617781 And the eighth and final rule: if this is<br />your first night, you have to fight.
2622886 2624922 <i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>
2625055 2629627 <i>couldn't remember whether</i><br /><i>you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>
2630628 2635799 <i>Ricky was a god for ten minutes when</i><br /><i>he trounced the maitre d' of a food court.</i>
2638202 2643374 <i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the</i><br /><i>flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling.</i>
2646343 2649647 <i>Or the wet choke</i><br /><i>when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>
2649780 2651649 Stop!
2651782 2654418 <i>You weren't alive anywhere</i><br /><i>like you were there.</i>
2654752 2660124 <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours</i><br /><i>between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>
2660257 2665029 <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good</i><br /><i>fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>
2665162 2669433 <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not</i><br /><i>who you were in the rest of the world.</i>
2669767 2673937 <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first</i><br /><i>time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>
2674071 2676907 <i>After a few weeks,</i><br /><i>he was carved out of wood.</i>
2677775 2680911 If you could fight any celebrity,<br />who would you fight?
2681045 2684948 - Alive or dead?<br />- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2685082 2688152 Hemingway. You?
2688852 2691989 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2693924 2697294 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>
2697428 2701365 <i>Everywhere we went,</i><br /><i>we were sizing things up.</i>
2704835 2707237 <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>
2707371 2711375 <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein</i><br /><i>or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>
2711708 2714411 Is that what a man looks like?
2714745 2717347 Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
2717481 2719483 Now, self-destruction...
2719817 2721785 Excuse me.
2756286 2759056 <i>Fight Club wasn't about</i><br /><i>winning or losing.</i>
2759189 2761525 <i>It wasn't about words.</i>
2763494 2769133 <i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,</i><br /><i>like at a Pentecostal church.</i>
2773770 2775806 - Is that it?<br />- Stop!
2775939 2778775 <i>When the fight was over,</i><br /><i>nothing was solved.</i>
2778909 2780777 <i>But nothing mattered.</i>
2780911 2782946 Cool.
2784515 2786984 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>
2787117 2790354 Hey, man. How about next week?
2790487 2792489 How about next month?
2792823 2796160 Irvine, you're in the middle.<br />New guy, you too.
2798262 2800130 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>
2800264 2802866 He fell down some stairs.
2803000 2805035 I fell down some stairs.
2807204 2811408 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut</i><br /><i>your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>
2811542 2814144 OK. Any historical figure.
2814878 2818448 - I'd fight Gandhi.<br />- Good answer.
2819383 2821585 - How about you?<br />- Lincoln.
2821919 2823921 - Lincoln?<br />- Mm-hm.
2824054 2827958 Big guy, big reach.<br />Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
2828091 2830127 Fuck!
2831328 2834965 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
2843173 2847044 - Hello?<br />- <i>Where've you been the last eight weeks?</i>
2847177 2848378 <i>Marla?</i>
2851615 2854484 - How did you find me?<br />- <i>You left a forwarding number.</i>
2854618 2857955 I haven't seen you<br />at any support groups.
2858088 2860958 <i>We split 'em up.</i><br /><i>That was the idea. Remember?</i>
2861091 2863894 Yeah, but you haven't been<br />going to yours.
2864027 2867364 - How do you know?<br />- I cheated.
2867497 2869333 I found a new one.
2869967 2872169 - Really?<br />- It's for men only.
2872302 2873904 Like the testicle thing?
2874037 2876073 Wah!
2878408 2882179 - Look, this is a bad time.<br />- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
2882312 2885182 - Some really fucked-up people.<br />- I'm on my way out.
2885315 2888252 Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
2888385 2892389 I took what was left of a bottle.<br />It might have been too much.
2892522 2896460 <i>Picture Marla Singer throwing herself</i><br /><i>around her crummy apartment.</i>
2896593 2901131 This isn't a for-real suicide.<br />It's probably a cry for help.
2901265 2902532 <i>This could go on for hours.</i>
2902666 2907938 - So you're staying in tonight?<br />- Do you wanna hear me describe death?
2908071 2911608 <i>Do you wanna listen</i><br /><i>and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>
2913677 2916546 <i>Have you ever heard</i><br /><i>a death rattle before?</i>
2942372 2947644 <i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for</i><br /><i>two months, his door was never closed.</i>
2953583 2959222 - You won't believe the dream I had last night.<br />- I hardly believe anything from last night.
2969066 2971034 What are you doing here?
2975172 2978308 - What?<br />- This is my house. What're you doing here?
2980610 2982612 Fuck you!
2997327 3000597 Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
3001598 3004735 Limber, though. Silly cooze.
3006403 3010340 I come in last night. Phone's off the<br />hook. Guess who's on the other end.
3010474 3013143 <i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>
3016012 3019015 <i>Have you ever heard</i><br /><i>a death rattle before?</i>
3019149 3021752 Do you think it'll live up to its name?
3022085 3026056 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>
3029059 3033029 <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>
3033163 3037501 <i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>
3037634 3041204 <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i><br /><i>think it was a bad thing</i>
3041338 3043740 <i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>
3044074 3048678 ..<i>five, four, three...</i>
3048812 3051047 Hang on.
3055519 3057788 You got here fast.
3060123 3062492 Did I call you?
3062626 3064327 Huh?
3072436 3075372 The mattress is all sealed<br />in slippery plastic.
3078542 3081711 Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
3084347 3087751 Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
3099696 3103300 - Hey, where's 513?<br />- End of the hall.
3104134 3107804 The girl who lives there<br />used to be a charming, lovely girl.
3108138 3110207 She has lost faith in herself.
3110340 3113143 - Miss Singer, let us help you!<br />- She's a monster!
3113276 3117314 - You have every reason to live.<br />- She's infectious human waste!
3117447 3121251 - Miss Singer!<br />- Good luck trying to save her!
3125889 3130527 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
3131828 3134631 You're gonna have to keep me up...
3134764 3136766 all night.
3136900 3139302 Un-fucking-believable.
3139436 3141505 <i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>
3141638 3146142 - You know what I mean. You fucked her.<br />- No, I didn't.
3146276 3149246 - Never?<br />- No.
3149379 3152649 - You're not into her, are you?<br />- No! God, not at all.
3152782 3155418 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>
3155552 3159256 - Are you sure? You can tell me.<br />- Believe me, I'm sure.
3159389 3162726 - <i>Put a gun to my head, spray my brains.</i><br />- That's good.
3162859 3167497 She's a predator posing as a house pet.<br />Stay away from that one.
3167631 3171301 The shit that came out of<br />this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
3171434 3172903 My God.
3173236 3176473 I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.
3176606 3178909 - Eugh!<br />- How could Tyler not go for that?
3179242 3182612 <i>The other night, he was</i><br /><i>splicing sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>
3182746 3185515 Marla doesn't need a lover,<br />just a caseworker.
3185649 3188285 And a wash.<br />This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
3188418 3191788 <i>She invaded my support groups</i><br /><i>and now my home.</i>
3191922 3193957 Hey, hey. Sit down.
3198194 3201865 - I can't have you talking to her about me.<br />- Why would I talk to her?
3202198 3208305 You say anything about me or what goes<br />on in this house to anybody, we're done.
3208438 3210206 - Now, promise me.<br />- OK.
3210340 3211841 - You promise?<br />- I promise.
3211975 3214511 - Promise.<br />- I just said, I promise! What...
3214644 3217547 That's three times you promised.
3218548 3222586 <i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes</i><br /><i>and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>
3222719 3224421 <i>none of this would've happened.</i>
3229359 3232829 Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
3239836 3242372 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>
3242505 3246343 <i>On the third floor</i><br /><i>where I might not have heard them.</i>
3246977 3249245 <i>But I didn't.</i>
3268932 3270700 Ow!
3272636 3276740 - What are you doing?<br />- Just going to bed.
3277741 3280844 - You wanna finish her off?<br />- Ooh!
3281778 3285448 - No. No, thank you.<br />- I found the cigarettes.
3286449 3288752 - Who were you talking to?<br />- Shut up.
3288885 3292689 <i>I became the calm little center</i><br /><i>of the world.</i>
3292822 3294858 <i>I was the Zen master.</i>
3299963 3302565 {\an8}<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>
3302699 3305802 {\an8}<i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>
3305935 3308505 Is that your blood?
3309706 3310874 Some of it, yeah.
3311007 3313743 You can't smoke in here.
3314911 3318515 Take the rest of the day off.<br />Come back Monday with clean clothes.
3318648 3320483 Get yourself together.
3320617 3325722 <i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i><br />"<i>Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>
3325855 3330060 "<i>Yes, I'm comfortable with that.</i><br /><i>I am enlightened."</i>
3331995 3336700 <i>You give up the condo life and</i><br /><i>all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>
3336833 3340437 <i>go live in a dilapidated house</i><br /><i>in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>
3340570 3344441 and you have to come home to this.
3354951 3359355 - Hello?<br />- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
3359489 3363393 <i>We have new information about</i><br /><i>the incident at your former condo.</i>
3363526 3365862 - Yes?<br />- I don't know if you're aware,
3365995 3368998 but someone sprayed Freon<br />into your front-door lock.
3369132 3372368 <i>They used a chisel</i><br /><i>to shatter the cylinder.</i>
3372502 3375939 - No, I wasn't aware of that.<br />- <i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>
3376072 3380643 - Does this sound strange to you?<br />- Yes, sir. Very strange.
3380777 3382412 - The dynamite...<br />- Dynamite?
3382545 3386649 ..left a residue of ammonium<br />oxalate potassium perchloride.
3386783 3390086 - Do you know what this means?<br />- No. What does it mean?
3390420 3392155 It means it was home-made.
3393423 3396559 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3396693 3402065 Whoever set this dynamite could've blown<br />your pilot light days before the explosion.
3402398 3405401 - The gas was just a detonator.<br />- Who'd do such a thing?
3405535 3408037 - <i>I'll ask the questions.</i><br />- Tell him.
3408171 3411975 "The liberator who destroyed my<br />property realigned my perceptions."
3412108 3417080 - Excuse me. Are you there?<br />- Yes. Hard to know what to make of this.
3417413 3421718 Have you recently made enemies who might<br />have access to home-made dynamite?
3421851 3424020 - Enemies?<br />- "I reject civilization,
3424154 3426156 especially material possessions."
3426489 3429125 - <i>Son, this is serious.</i><br />- Yes, I know it's serious.
3429459 3431861 - I mean that.<br />- Yes, it's very serious.
3431995 3438501 Look, nobody takes this more seriously<br />than me. That condo was my life. OK?
3438635 3441171 I loved every stick of furniture<br />in that place.
3441504 3444474 <i>That was not just a bunch of stuff</i><br /><i>that got destroyed.</i>
3444607 3446943 - It was me!<br />- I thank the Academy.
3447076 3451548 - <i>Is this not a good time for you?</i><br />- Just tell him you fucking did it!
3451681 3455518 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3455652 3459722 - Are you still there?<br />- Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
3459856 3464561 No. I may need to talk to you, so you<br />let me know if you're gonna leave town.
3464694 3466963 - <i>OK?</i><br />- OK.
3470233 3474204 <i>Except for their humping, Tyler</i><br /><i>and Marla were never in the same room.</i>
3474537 3477540 <i>My parents pulled</i><br /><i>this exact same act for years.</i>
3477674 3481211 The condom is the glass slipper<br />of our generation.
3481544 3484214 You slip one on<br />when you meet a stranger.
3484547 3489052 You dance all night,<br />then you throw it away.
3489185 3491988 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3493022 3494624 What?
3499496 3502098 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
3502232 3504067 It was worth every penny.
3504200 3506236 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3508137 3512242 Someone loved it intensely for one day,
3513276 3514811 then tossed it.
3516713 3518748 Like a Christmas tree.
3518882 3520950 So special.
3521818 3524254 Then... bam!
3524587 3526956 It's on the side of the road.
3527090 3529692 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3531194 3538201 Like a sex-crime victim, underwear<br />inside out, bound with electrical tape.
3538735 3541204 Well, then, it suits you.
3541538 3543806 You can borrow it sometime.
3550713 3552882 Get rid of her.
3553016 3555652 - What? You get rid of her!<br />- Don't mention me.
3555785 3559889 <i>I am six years old again,</i><br /><i>passing messages between parents.</i>
3562992 3565929 - It's time you left.<br />- Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3566062 3570967 - Not that we don't love your visits.<br />- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
3575271 3576706 Thanks. Bye.
3591688 3594591 You kids!
3594724 3597627 Why do you still waste time with her?
3598661 3602198 I'll say this about Marla.<br />At least she's trying to hit bottom.
3602332 3603733 And I'm not?
3603866 3607370 Sticking feathers up your butt<br />does not make you a chicken.
3607704 3609272 What are we doing tonight?
3609606 3612642 Tonight... we make soap.
3612775 3616746 - Really?<br />- To make soap, first we render fat.
3636065 3641638 The salt balance has to be just right, the<br />best fat for soap comes from humans.
3641771 3645375 - Wait. What is this place?<br />- A liposuction clinic.
3652915 3654917 Aha! Pay dirt!
3655051 3659922 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />The fat of the land!
3664961 3668031 No! Don't pull it.
3672702 3675271 - Oh, God!<br />- I'll get another one.
3682211 3686716 As the fat renders, the tallows float<br />to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
3686849 3690453 - It's hard to imagine you a Boy Scout.<br />- Keep stirring.
3692922 3696325 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerin.
3696459 3698928 Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
3699062 3703866 If you then add sodium nitrate<br />and sawdust, you got dynamite.
3704000 3706803 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
3706936 3708938 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>
3709072 3713342 Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner<br />when washed in one part of the river.
3713476 3715078 - You know why?<br />- No.
3718915 3721784 Humans were once sacrificed<br />on the hills above.
3721918 3725988 Bodies burnt, water seeped<br />through the ashes to create lye.
3726122 3728057 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3728191 3732328 Once it mixed with the melted body fat,<br />a soapy discharge crept into the river.
3732462 3734497 May I see your hand, please?
3742004 3743172 What is this?
3743306 3745908 - This is a chemical burn.<br />- Agh! Aaagh!
3746042 3749378 It'll hurt more than you've ever<br />been burned and leave a scar.
3749512 3752949 <i>If meditation worked for cancer,</i><br /><i>it could work for this.</i>
3753082 3755852 - Don't shut the pain out.<br />- Oh, God!
3756486 3761023 The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,<br />like the first monkey shot into space.
3761157 3764093 Without pain or sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3764227 3767096 <i>I tried not to think</i><br /><i>of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>
3767230 3770299 Stop it! This is your pain,<br />this is your burning hand.
3770433 3773369 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3773503 3777206 No! Don't deal with this<br />the way those dead people do! Come on!
3777340 3781310 - I get the point!<br />- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
3784914 3788184 It's the greatest moment of your life,<br />and you're missing it!
3788317 3789852 I am not...
3789986 3792922 Shut up! Our fathers<br />were our models for God.
3793055 3797093 If our fathers bailed,<br />what does that tell you about God?
3797794 3802965 Listen to me. You have to consider the<br />possibility that God does not like you.
3803099 3806469 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, he hates you.
3806803 3810206 This is not the worst thing<br />that can happen. We don't need him!
3810339 3813242 - I agree!<br />- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
3813376 3815912 We are God's unwanted children?<br />So be it!
3816045 3820049 - I'm getting water!<br />- You can use water and make it worse or...
3820183 3821417 Look at me!
3821551 3825121 - ..or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />- Please let me up!
3825254 3827256 First, you have to give up.
3827390 3830092 First, you have to know - not fear -
3830226 3833162 know that someday, you're gonna die.
3833296 3835431 You don't know how this feels!
3840336 3845541 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3845875 3847910 OK.
3861924 3866162 Congratulations.<br />You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
3868631 3873970 <i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at</i><br /><i>$20 a bar. God knows what they charged.</i>
3874103 3878074 - This is the best soap.<br />- Why, thank you, Susan.
3878207 3879642 <i>It was beautiful.</i>
3879976 3883646 <i>We were selling rich women</i><br /><i>their own fat asses back to them.</i>
3885147 3886883 <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>
3887016 3889418 <i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>
3889552 3892955 "The first rule of Fight Club<br />is don't talk about Fight Club"?
3893089 3896459 <i>I'm half-asleep again.</i><br /><i>I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>
3896592 3899595 "The second rule..." Is this yours?
3899929 3900963 Huh?
3901097 3904467 Pretend you're me.<br />Make a managerial decision.
3904600 3907136 You find this. What would you do?
3911641 3913609 Well, I gotta tell you,
3913943 3917313 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3917446 3920917 Because the person who wrote that<br />is dangerous.
3921050 3925388 And this button-down, Oxford-cloth<br />psycho might just snap
3925521 3928357 and then stalk from office to office
3928491 3933462 with an Armalite AR10 carbine<br />gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
3933596 3938567 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3938701 3942138 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.
3942271 3946175 Someone very, very close to you.
3946309 3948711 <i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>
3950279 3952315 <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>
3952448 3956052 Or maybe you shouldn't bring me<br />every piece of trash you pick up.
3959422 3962725 - Compliance and Liability.<br />- My tit's gonna rot off.
3964593 3967363 Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
3973069 3977039 - What do you mean?<br />- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
3977173 3981544 - Go to a hospital.<br />- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
3981677 3984046 I don't know about this, Marla.
3984180 3985247 Please?
3985381 3989352 <i>She didn't call Tyler.</i><br /><i>I'm neutral in her book.</i>
3991387 3995391 That's nice. Taking food<br />to Mrs... Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
3995524 3997526 Where are they, exactly?
3997660 4001697 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4002031 4004033 - No, no.<br />- I got one for you.
4004166 4006202 Thanks for the thought.
4007503 4009705 What happened to your hand?
4010039 4012141 Oh, nothing.
4012641 4015211 - Right there?<br />- Mm.
4015344 4018014 - Feel anything?<br />- No.
4018147 4020783 Well, make sure.
4021117 4024353 - OK, I'm pretty sure.<br />- You feel nothing?
4025287 4027356 No, nothing.
4028357 4031460 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
4032595 4035731 - No problem.<br />- I wish I could return the favor.
4036065 4038067 Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
4038200 4041537 - I could check your prostate.<br />- I think I'm OK.
4041670 4043706 Well, thanks, anyway.
4048711 4051213 - Are we done?<br />- Yeah, we're done.
4051347 4053416 See you... around.
4070566 4072601 Cornelius?
4072735 4075171 Cornelius!
4075304 4077807 It's me! Bob!
4078140 4079475 Hey, Bob.
4083312 4086415 - We all thought you were dead.<br />- No, no. Still here.
4086549 4090186 - How are you, Bob?<br />- Better than I've been in my whole life.
4090319 4095491 - Really? Still Remaining Men Together?<br />- No. I got something much better now.
4095624 4098194 Really? What is it?
4098327 4100162 Well...
4100296 4105101 The first rule is,<br />I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4105234 4106602 And the second rule is...
4106735 4108537 I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4108671 4112608 - And the third rule is...<br />- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
4113342 4115411 Look at my face, Bob.
4117246 4119482 That's fucking great.
4119615 4123319 - I've never seen you there.<br />- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4123452 4126722 - I go Saturday.<br />- Congratulations.
4127723 4129758 Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?
4129892 4132561 Have you heard about the guy<br />that invented it?
4132695 4135564 - Yeah, actually...<br />- I hear all kinds of things.
4135698 4139768 Supposedly,<br />he was born in a mental institution
4139902 4143539 and he sleeps only one hour a night.
4143672 4146742 - He's a great man.<br />- Oh...
4146876 4149612 Do you know about Tyler Durden?
4173802 4176372 I didn't hurt you, did I?
4176505 4178807 Actually, you did.
4178941 4182578 Thank you for this.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4182711 4184947 <i>Fight Club.</i>
4185281 4187316 <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>
4187583 4189618 <i>Our gift to the world.</i>
4189752 4192821 I look around, I look around,<br />I see a lot of new faces.
4194523 4196692 Shut up!
4197760 4203232 Which means a lot of people have been<br />breaking the first rules of Fight Club.
4209905 4214577 I see in Fight Club the strongest<br />and smartest men who've ever lived.
4214710 4219415 I see all this potential.<br />And I see it squandered.
4220249 4223385 Goddammit,<br />an entire generation pumping gas,
4223519 4225221 or waiting tables.
4225354 4227623 Slaves with white collars.
4229758 4232795 Advertising has us chasing cars<br />and clothes,
4232928 4237466 working jobs we hate<br />so we can buy shit we don't need.
4240236 4244940 We're the middle children of history,<br />men. No purpose or place.
4245274 4247309 We have no Great War,
4247443 4249478 no Great Depression.
4251280 4253816 Our great war is a spiritual war.
4253949 4256919 Our great depression is our lives.
4261023 4264793 We've all been raised on TV to believe<br />that one day we'd be millionaires
4264927 4266929 and movie gods and rock stars.
4267263 4269265 But we won't.
4269398 4272001 We're slowly learning that fact.
4272334 4275004 And we're very, very pissed off.
4275337 4277373 Yeah!
4279842 4283445 First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
4288817 4290819 Who are you?
4290953 4293622 - Who am I?<br />- Yeah.
4294890 4298360 There's a sign on the front<br />that says Lou's Tavern.
4298494 4302398 I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
4302931 4304500 Tyler Durden.
4307603 4310606 Who told you motherfuckers<br />you could use my place?
4310739 4313509 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
4313642 4318781 Irvine's at home with a broken<br />collarbone. He don't own this place. I do.
4321083 4323952 - How much money does he get?<br />- There is no money.
4324086 4325888 - Really?<br />- Free to all.
4326021 4328791 - Ain't that something.<br />- It is, actually.
4328924 4331427 Look, stupid fuck!
4331560 4337433 - I want everybody out of here right now.<br />- Hey! You should join our club.
4337566 4340869 - Did you hear what I just said?<br />- You and your friend.
4342805 4345874 You hear me now?
4347042 4349111 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
4355718 4357419 Still not getting it.
4358787 4360556 Agh! OK, OK, I got it.
4360689 4363025 I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
4364760 4366929 Back! All of you!
4367730 4369798 Everybody back!
4377373 4379475 Ah, Lou!
4379608 4383112 Come on, man!<br />We really like this place.
4392921 4396125 - That's right, Lou. Get it out.<br />- Shut the fuck up.
4396458 4399728 Oh, yeah!
4401997 4404066 Is that fucking funny?
4413008 4416412 Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
4417079 4418847 Unbelievable.
4423018 4425954 - You don't know where I've been, Lou.<br />- Oh, my God!
4426088 4428957 You don't know where I've been!
4432027 4435063 Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
4435197 4440669 - Fucking use the basement! Christ!<br />- I want your word! I want your word!
4440803 4442771 On my mother's eyes.
4451880 4453949 Thanks, Lou.
4455217 4457486 You too, big guy.
4461457 4463525 We'll see you next week.
4478941 4483812 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4483946 4488517 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4490752 4493555 You're gonna start a fight,
4493689 4495791 and you're gonna lose.
4497926 4499828 Excellent choice, sir.
4501630 4504700 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4504833 4507903 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>
4510672 4512608 What... Son of a bitch!
4512741 4517813 <i>Most people - normal people </i>-<br /><i>do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>
4518847 4520282 Excuse me!
4520616 4522618 You sprayed me with your hose.
4522751 4524119 That's not necessary.
4524253 4526154 Jay! Go call 911!
4528957 4530959 Put the hose down.
4531093 4533128 Stop it! Stop it!
4535731 4536765 Sorry.
4544106 4546542 You bastard!
4552180 4554750 We need to talk.
4556552 4558620 OK.
4559855 4561123 Where to begin?
4561256 4563926 With your constant absenteeism?
4564059 4566862 With your unpresentable appearance?
4566995 4571600 - You're up for review.<br />- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4571733 4573602 - What?<br />- Let's pretend.
4573735 4577139 You're the Department<br />of Transportation, OK?
4577272 4582244 Someone informs you that this company<br />installs front-seat mounting brackets
4582578 4584313 that never pass collision tests,
4584646 4587916 brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
4588050 4593155 and fuel injectors<br />that explode and burn people alive.
4593288 4595123 What then?
4595257 4597793 - Are you threatening me?<br />- No...
4597926 4601330 - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!<br />- I have a better solution.
4601663 4604933 Keep me on the payroll<br />as an outside consultant
4605067 4611273 in exchange for my salary, my job will be<br />never to tell people things that I know.
4611607 4616044 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4616178 4621149 Who... who the fuck do you think<br />you are, you crazy little shit?
4625253 4628890 - Security!<br />- <i>I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>
4635631 4636999 Agh!
4638166 4639968 What the hell are you doing?
4649111 4651747 That hurt.
4653215 4655217 Why would you do that?
4655350 4658320 Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
4668864 4670899 What are you doing?
4671033 4673035 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4673168 4677172 <i>For some reason,</i><br /><i>I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

4717379 4722184 <i>And right then,</i><br /><i>at our most excellent moment together...</i>
4723218 4727022 Thank God!<br />Please don't hit me again.

4895457 4897425 Human sacrifice.
4897559 4902497 - Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.<br />- It's a gun. Meet me in the back.

4971266 4972701 Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!
4973034 4975303 - Veterinarian. Veterinarian.<br />- Animals.
4975437 4978340 - Yeah. Animals and stuff.<br />- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
4978473 4981076 - So you need more schooling.<br />- Too much school.
4981209 4983511 - Would you rather be dead?<br />- No, please...
4983645 4988149 You'd rather die here, on your knees,<br />in the back of a convenience store?
4988283 4991219 No. Please, no.
4994456 4997192 I'm keeping your license.
4997325 5001096 Gonna check in on you.<br />I know where you live.
5001229 5005500 If you're not on your way to being a<br />veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.
5008136 5010405 Now, run on home.
5014342 5016344 Run, Forrest, run!
5018046 5020115 I feel ill.
5021483 5025453 - Imagine how he feels.<br />- Come on, this isn't funny!
5025587 5028089 What the fuck was the point of that?
5028223 5031693 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day<br />of Raymond K Hessel's life.
5032027 5036297 His breakfast will taste better than<br />any meal you and I have ever tasted.
5037632 5039667 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>
5039801 5042237 - Come on.<br />- <i>He had a plan.</i>
5042370 5045640 <i>And it started to make sense</i><br /><i>in a Tyler sort of way.</i>
5045774 5048743 <i>No fear. No distractions.</i>
5049077 5053281 <i>The ability to let that which</i><br /><i>does not matter truly slide.</i>
5066594 5068696 <i>You are not your job.</i>
5070632 5074135 You're not how much money<br />you have in the bank.
5075703 5078306 You're not the car you drive.
5078440 5082143 You're not the contents of your wallet.
5082277 5084646 You're not your fucking khakis.
5086448 5090585 You are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5098827 5101262 I'll be out of your way in a sec.
5102097 5104165 You don't have to go.
5105567 5107635 Whatever.
5108436 5111806 No, I mean... It's OK.
5121449 5124185 Are you still going to groups?
5124319 5126354 Yeah.
5127722 5129757 Chloe's dead.
5129891 5132760 Wow. Chloe.
5132894 5135230 When did that happen?
5135363 5137599 Do you care?
5137732 5140401 I dunno. I haven't thought about it<br />in a while.
5140535 5142737 Yeah, well...
5142871 5145907 It was the smart move on her part.
5147775 5149878 Listen, um...
5150211 5152647 What are you getting out of all this?
5152780 5154782 What?
5154916 5157886 I mean, all this. Why do you keep...?
5158219 5160255 Is this making you happy?
5161723 5163791 Yeah, well, sometimes.
5165560 5167629 I don't know. I don't understand.
5167762 5173501 Why does a weaker person need to latch<br />on to a strong person? What is that?
5173635 5175737 What do you get out of it?
5177705 5182710 No... That's not the same thing at all.<br />It's totally different with us.
5182844 5184546 "Us"?
5184679 5188416 - What do you mean by "us"?<br />- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
5188550 5191186 - Hear what?<br />- All that noise. Hold on.
5191319 5194556 No, wait! Don't change the subject!<br />I want to talk about this.
5194689 5197458 - You're not talking about me, are you?<br />- No.
5197592 5200895 - What?<br />- You playing doctor. What was going on?
5201229 5204365 - What are you talking about?<br />- Nothing. Nothing.
5204499 5206501 - I don't think so.<br />- What do you want?
5206634 5208937 - Look at me.<br />- No. What?
5210438 5213341 - What is that?<br />- It's nothing. Don't worry.
5213474 5216311 - My God. Who did this?<br />- A person.
5216444 5217612 Guy or girl?
5217745 5220281 - What do you care?<br />- What do you care if I ask?
5220415 5222417 - Leave me alone.<br />- You're afraid to say.
5222550 5224819 - I am not. Let me go.<br />- No! Talk to me.
5224953 5226588 Let go of me. Leave me alone!
5226721 5228856 - This conversation...<br />- This conversation...
5228990 5231559 - ..is over.<br />- ..is over.
5233461 5236231 I just can't win with you, can I?
5244439 5248610 Hey, this is getting a little old!
5248743 5250612 What is... what is all this?
5250745 5253381 What do you think?
5253815 5256017 Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
5256351 5257385 Hey!
5264826 5267795 Too young. Sorry.
5268696 5270431 What's all that?
5270565 5273835 Tell the applicant<br />if he's too young, too old or too fat.
5273968 5275303 Applicant?
5275436 5281376 If the applicant waits three days without food<br />or shelter, he may enter and begin training.
5281509 5283378 Training for what?
5288816 5293388 You think this is a game? You're<br />too young to train here, end of story.
5293521 5296858 Quit wasting our time.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
5300495 5302830 Bad news, friend.
5302964 5305667 It's not gonna happen.
5305800 5307935 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
5308069 5311572 It's not the end of the world.<br />Just... go away.
5312774 5314475 Go.
5314609 5318980 You're trespassing<br />and I will have to call the police.
5322383 5326688 Don't you look at me! You're<br />never getting in this fucking house!
5326821 5330058 Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!<br />Get off my porch!
5330391 5333428 <i>Sooner or later, we all became</i><br /><i>what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>
5333561 5336731 I'm gonna go inside<br />and I'm gonna get a shovel.
5344372 5348443 Got two black shirts?<br />Two pair of black pants?
5348576 5351379 - Yes, sir.<br />- One pair black boots? Black socks?
5351512 5352947 - Sir.<br />- One black jacket?
5353081 5355416 - Sir.<br />- $300 personal burial money?
5355550 5357051 Yes, sir.
5359387 5361456 All right.
5371466 5373534 You're too old, fat man.
5374502 5377772 Your tits are too big.<br />Get the fuck off my porch.
5384912 5386981 Bob! Bob!
5402463 5404999 Like a monkey<br />ready to be shot into space.
5405800 5407435 Space monkey.
5408136 5411672 Ready to sacrifice himself<br />for the greater good.
5417078 5420448 You are too fucking old, fatty!
5420581 5425086 And you... You're too fucking blond!
5425419 5427688 Get out of here, the both of you!
5428055 5429657 <i>And so it went.</i>
5429791 5431993 Listen up, maggots.
5432126 5434529 You are not special.
5434662 5438499 You are not a beautiful<br />or unique snowflake.
5438633 5442203 You are the same decaying organic<br />matter as everything else.
5442537 5444672 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>
5444806 5448876 <i>We are the all-singing,</i><br /><i>all-dancing crap of the world.</i>
5449010 5452613 <i>We are all part of the same</i><br /><i>compost heap.</i>
5454081 5457518 <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>
5457652 5461055 <i>To what purpose?</i><br /><i>For what greater good?</i>
5464525 5466594 <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>
5469931 5476938 No, no, no, no. When he was, like, "You<br />are not your job," I was, like, "Yeah!"
5479507 5482844 - Hey, what's all this?<br />- Hey!
5484245 5486047 OK!
5486180 5488516 - What's going on?<br />- We're celebrating.
5488649 5491018 - What are we celebrating?<br />- Go on.
5495089 5497158 - Hey.<br />- Let me get that for you.
5501829 5505733 <i>Same great taste.</i><br /><i>Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>
5506534 5508870 Shh!
5509003 5513741 <i>Investigators are on the scene.</i><br /><i>The police commissioner has arrived.</i>
5513875 5517078 <i>Could you tell us</i><br /><i>what you think has happened here?</i>
5517211 5521015 <i>We believe this is one of many</i><br /><i>recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>
5521148 5524952 <i>somehow related to</i><br /><i>underground boxing clubs.</i>
5525086 5528890 <i>We will be coordinating</i><br /><i>a rigorous investigation.</i>
5529023 5532293 <i>That was Commissioner Jacobs</i><br /><i>who just arrived on the scene</i>
5532627 5537732 - of a four-alarm fire that broke out...<br />- She's hot.
5537865 5539700 <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>
5540668 5542069 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
5543604 5545673 - Holy shit!<br />- Yeah!
5552580 5554916 What the fuck did you guys do?
5555049 5559086 <i>Arson investigators</i><br /><i>are on the premises...</i>
5563925 5568262 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions, sir.
5570932 5574235 <i>Police Commissioner Jacobs</i><br /><i>is on the scene...</i>
5574568 5578239 The victory in the war against crime<br />will not come overnight.
5578572 5582944 It will take dedication and commitment<br />and, most of all, cooperation.
5583077 5587081 Streets are safer now.<br />There is hope in the inner city.
5587214 5590851 - However...<br />- I gotta take a piss.
5590985 5596090 These are the first steps in a long journey.<br />That is why we created Project Hope...
5596223 5597291 Bob.
5597625 5601329 ..helping others<br />with prevention and enforcement.
5601662 5606367 Project Hope'll be a joint effort between<br />the police and community leaders.
5606701 5610805 It will be a powerful new weapon<br />in the war against crime.
5656851 5661722 - Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.<br />- Man! His balls are ice-cold.
5662690 5665726 Hi. You're gonna call off<br />your rigorous investigation.
5665860 5668763 You will publicly state<br />there is no underground group,
5668896 5671432 or these guys are gonna take your balls.
5672333 5676170 They'll send one to the New York Times<br />and one to the LA Times.
5677271 5680941 Look, the people you are after<br />are the people you depend on.
5681075 5684879 We cook your meals. We haul your trash.<br />We connect your calls.
5685012 5688949 We drive your ambulances.<br />We guard you while you sleep.
5693120 5695956 Do not fuck with us.
5704899 5706700 Ball check!
5721048 5722950 Bob, this way.
5723851 5725286 Let's go.
5726287 5729490 <i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>
5729824 5731859 Hey!
5746240 5747475 Yeah!
5780374 5786113 <i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i><br /><i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>
5788482 5791318 <i>I wanted to open</i><br /><i>the dump valves on oil tankers</i>
5791452 5794989 <i>and smother all those French beaches</i><br /><i>I'd never see.</i>
5799093 5801529 <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>
5818145 5820548 Where did you go, psycho boy?
5822016 5824952 I felt like destroying<br />something beautiful.
5829056 5832526 - Get him to a fucking hospital.<br />- Yeah.
5843337 5847908 Don't worry, Mr. Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.
5848042 5850077 After you, Mr. Durden.
5851045 5853113 After you.
5870931 5873367 - Something on your mind, dear?<br />- No.
5873500 5876303 Yeah. Why wasn't I told<br />about Project Mayhem?
5876437 5880341 First rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions.
5880474 5884144 - Why wasn't I included in the beginning?<br />- Fight Club was the beginning.
5884278 5887314 Now it's left the basements<br />and it's Project Mayhem.
5887448 5892086 We started Fight Club together. Remember?<br />It's as much mine as it is yours.
5892219 5896357 - Is this about you and me?<br />- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
5896490 5898492 This does not belong to us.
5898626 5902429 - We are not special.<br />- Fuck that. You should have told me.
5903297 5905299 Hey, Tyler!
5907167 5909203 - Goddammit, Tyler!<br />- What do you want?
5909336 5912172 A statement of purpose?<br />Should I email you?
5912306 5914975 - Look...<br />- You decide your level of involvement!
5915109 5917578 I will! I wanna know certain things first!
5917911 5920381 - The first rule of Project Mayhem...<br />- Shut up!
5921649 5925986 - I wanna know what you're thinking.<br />- Fuck what you know!
5926120 5929390 Forget about what you think you know<br />about life, friendship,
5929523 5931558 and especially about you and me.
5933160 5936096 What is that supposed to mean? What...?
5938332 5940467 What are you doing?
5941935 5944171 What'll you wish you'd done<br />before you die?
5944305 5947107 - Paint a self-portrait.<br />- Build a house.
5947241 5949243 - And you?<br />- I don't know. Nothing.
5949376 5952079 - Get in the right lane.<br />- You have to know!
5952212 5954682 If you died now,<br />how would you feel about your life?
5955015 5958986 I don't know! Nothing good.<br />Is that what you want to hear me say?
5959119 5961288 - Come on!<br />- Not good enough.
5961422 5963957 Stop fucking around! Tyler!
5965159 5967361 Jesus Christ!
5968162 5970664 Goddammit! Goddammit! Fuck you!
5970998 5975169 Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!<br />I am sick of all your shit!
5976136 5978205 OK, man. OK.
5979006 5981408 - Quit screwing around. Steer!<br />- Look at you!
5981542 5984278 - Steer!<br />- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
5984411 5989483 - Why? What are you talking about?<br />- Why'd you think I blew up your condo?
5990551 5991585 What?
5991719 5996123 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.<br />It's not a goddamn seminar.
5996256 5999460 Stop trying to control everything<br />and just let go!
6002329 6005265 - Let go!<br />- All right. Fine.
6006166 6008102 Fine.
6066393 6069696 <i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>
6069830 6072533 <i>This must have been</i><br /><i>what all those people felt like</i>
6072666 6075769 <i>before I filed them</i><br /><i>as statistics in my reports.</i>
6076103 6078138 Goddamn!
6081375 6084511 We've just had a near-life experience!
6089416 6094555 In the world I see, you're stalking elk<br />through the damp canyon forests
6094688 6097424 around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
6099426 6104131 You'll wear leather clothes<br />that will last you the rest of your life.
6104264 6109303 You'll climb the thick kudzu vines<br />that wrap the Sears Tower.
6109436 6113774 And when you look down,<br />you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
6114107 6120781 laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool<br />lane of some abandoned superhighway.
6132526 6134728 Feel better, champ.
6152646 6153881 <i>And then...</i>
6154214 6155516 Tyler?
6155649 6157684 ..<i>Tyler was gone.</i>
6165759 6167828 <i>Was I asleep?</i>
6169296 6170330 <i>Had I slept?</i>
6170464 6173433 You are not<br />a beautiful, unique snowflake...
6173567 6176436 <i>The house had become a living thing,</i>
6176570 6179506 <i>wet inside from so many people</i><br /><i>sweating and breathing.</i>
6179640 6185812 - We're all part of the same compost heap...<br />- <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>
6186914 6188682 <i>Planet Tyler.</i>
6188815 6193587 <i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside</i><br /><i>this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>
6193720 6196890 You can't be smoking!<br />You know how much ether is in here?
6197224 6200594 <i>Cooking and working</i><br /><i>and sleeping in teams.</i>
6203297 6204865 Hang on a second.
6224651 6227521 It's under control, sir.
6229423 6230757 Where's Tyler?
6230891 6233827 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not...
6233961 6235896 Right. OK.
6238432 6240500 <i>I'm all alone.</i>
6240634 6244338 <i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>
6244471 6246640 <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>
6250811 6255482 <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem,</i><br /><i>only Tyler knows.</i>
6255616 6259386 <i>The second rule</i><br /><i>is you do not ask questions.</i>
6261588 6264358 Get the fuck away from me!<br />Get the fuck away!
6265525 6267928 Who are all these people?
6271898 6274701 The Paper Street Soap Company.
6276837 6278472 Can I come in?
6281742 6283810 He's not here.
6283944 6285445 What?
6286513 6289950 Tyler isn't here.
6290283 6292552 Tyler went away.
6292686 6294721 Tyler's gone.
6310637 6313507 Jesus! Get some help!
6325318 6329556 Two gunshot wounds coming through!<br />Make some fucking room!
6329690 6331525 What happened? What happened?
6331658 6336063 We were on assignment. We were<br />supposed to kill two birds with one stone.
6336396 6338398 Destroy a piece of corporate art...
6338532 6340934 Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
6342836 6344771 ..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
6351111 6353580 We had it all worked out, sir.
6361722 6364925 - It went smooth until...<br />- Police! Freeze!
6365058 6367828 - What?<br />- They shot Bob.
6369429 6372365 - They shot him in the head.<br />- Fucking pigs!
6377070 6379072 Oh, God!
6379406 6383076 - Those motherfuckers!<br />- You morons.
6383410 6386413 You run around in ski masks<br />trying to blow things up?
6386546 6389549 What did you think was gonna happen?
6392052 6395622 OK, quick! We gotta<br />get rid of the evidence - this body!
6395756 6397924 - Bury him.<br />- What?
6398058 6400894 Take him to the garden and bury him.
6401027 6405599 - Come on, people, let's go!<br />- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
6405732 6409836 What are you talking about? This<br />isn't fucking evidence. This is a person.
6409970 6413073 He's my friend and you're<br />not burying him in the garden!
6413406 6416143 He was killed<br />serving Project Mayhem, sir.
6416476 6418445 - This is Bob.<br />- But, sir, in...
6418578 6421047 in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
6421181 6427120 You listen to me. This is a man and he<br />has a name, it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
6427454 6428488 Robert Paulsen?
6428622 6433627 He's a man, and he's dead now because<br />of us. Do you understand that?
6433760 6435095 I understand.
6437497 6443670 In death, a member of Project Mayhem<br />has a name.
6443804 6445972 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6446506 6448575 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6449209 6451945 His name... is Robert Paulsen.
6453146 6455849 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6455982 6461721 - Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.<br />- His name is Robert Paulsen.
6461855 6464891 Shut up! This is all over with!
6500160 6503797 - Tyler?<br />- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
6503930 6505599 I need to see you...
6509970 6514741 <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's</i><br /><i>used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>
6514875 6519546 <i>I didn't know how, but I could look at 50</i><br /><i>different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>
6519679 6523617 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.<br />It's very important that I talk to him.
6524017 6526086 I wish I could help you,
6526219 6527721 sir.
6533660 6536563 <i>Every city I went to,</i>
6536696 6538965 <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>
6539099 6541534 <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>
6542235 6544070 Hey! Hey!
6544204 6545805 Taxi!
6545939 6550644 Look at my face. I'm a member. Now,<br />I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
6550777 6554281 I'm not exposed to bespeak<br />any such information to you,
6554614 6559152 nor would I, even if I had said<br />information at this juncture, be able.
6560720 6563690 - You're a moron.<br />- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
6564925 6569963 <i>Tyler had been busy, setting</i><br /><i>up franchises all over the country.</i>
6572766 6577103 <i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>
6577237 6580807 <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>
6580941 6583343 - We've just heard the stories.<br />- What stories?
6583677 6588214 - Nobody knows what he looks like.<br />- He has plastic surgery every three years.
6588348 6590750 That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
6590884 6595622 - Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?<br />- Is Mr. Durden building an army?
6595755 6599993 <i>I was living in a state</i><br /><i>of perpetual déjà vu.</i>
6600126 6603697 <i>Everywhere I went,</i><br /><i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>
6603830 6606733 <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>
6607801 6609903 <i>The smell of dried blood.</i>
6610971 6613940 <i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>
6614074 6617377 <i>That aroma of old sweat,</i><br /><i>like fried chicken.</i>
6617711 6621915 <i>The feel of a floor still warm</i><br /><i>from a fight the night before.</i>
6622048 6624951 <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>
6627654 6632892 His name is Robert Paulsen.<br />His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
6635829 6637897 Welcome back, sir.
6638932 6640834 How have you been?
6641835 6643837 Do you know me?
6643970 6647407 - Is this a test, sir?<br />- No. This is not a test.
6648408 6651144 You were in here last Thursday.
6651277 6653013 Thursday?
6653146 6657817 You were standing where you are now,<br />asking how good security is.
6657951 6660387 It's tight as a drum, sir.
6662088 6664257 Who do you think I am?
6664891 6668962 - Are you sure this isn't a test?<br />- No, this is not a test.
6669963 6672399 You're Mr. Durden.
6672732 6675101 You're the one who gave me this.
6676002 6680907 <i>Please return your seat backs</i><br /><i>to their full upright and locked position.</i>
6691351 6692886 - Yeah?<br />- <i>Marla, it's me.</i>
6693019 6695155 - Have we ever done it?<br />- Done what?
6695288 6698725 - Had sex.<br />- What kind of stupid question is that?
6698858 6701461 Stupid because the answer's yes<br />or because it's no?
6701795 6703797 - Is this a trick?<br />- No. I need to know...
6703930 6707801 You wanna know if I think<br />we were just having sex or making love?
6708334 6711171 - We did make love?<br />- Is that what you're calling it?
6711304 6714441 Just answer the question!<br />Did we do it or not?
6714774 6717310 You fuck me, then snub me.<br />You love me, you hate me.
6717444 6720213 You're sensitive,<br />then you turn into an asshole.
6720346 6722882 Does that describe our relationship,<br />Tyler?
6723016 6725318 <i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>
6725452 6727787 - What did you say?<br />- What is wrong with you?
6727921 6729923 - Say my name!<br />- Tyler Durden.
6730056 6732826 Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!<br />What's going on?
6732959 6734994 - I'm coming over!<br />- I'm not there!
6736996 6739032 You broke your promise.
6739165 6741501 - Jesus, Tyler.<br />- You talked to her about me.
6741835 6746406 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- I ask you for one thing. One thing.
6746739 6749876 Why do people think that I'm you?
6750009 6752045 Answer me!
6755181 6756249 Sit.
6759452 6762822 Answer me.<br />Why do people think I'm you?
6762956 6764491 I think you know.
6764824 6766759 - No, I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6766893 6770263 Why would anyone<br />possibly confuse you with me?
6770396 6772365 I... I don't know.
6777170 6779472 - You got it.<br />- No.
6779806 6782242 - Do not fuck with us!<br />- Say it.
6783543 6785812 Because...
6787080 6788214 Say it!
6790049 6792919 Because we're the same person.
6793052 6794087 That's right.
6794220 6796322 We are the all-singing, all-dancing...
6796456 6800160 - I don't understand this.<br />- You wanted a way to change your life.
6800293 6802529 You could not do this on your own.
6802862 6807000 All the ways you wish you could be -<br />that's me.
6807133 6809569 I look like you wanna look,<br />fuck like you wanna fuck,
6809903 6814941 I am smart, capable, most importantly,<br />I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
6815074 6816109 Oh, no.
6816242 6819078 - Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.<br />- What?
6819212 6823516 - This is impossible. This is crazy.<br />- People do it every day.
6823850 6827453 They talk to themselves.<br />They see themselves as they'd like to be.
6827587 6830523 They don't have the courage you have<br />to just run with it.
6834327 6837597 You still wrestle with it,<br />so sometimes you're still you.
6837931 6839532 We should do this again sometime.
6839866 6842468 Other times,<br />you imagine you're watching me.
6842602 6845138 If this is your first time,<br />you have to fight.
6845271 6849943 Little by little,<br />you're just letting yourself become...
6850977 6852312 Tyler Durden.
6852445 6855215 You are not your job<br />or how much money you have!
6855348 6857617 - No. You have a house.<br />- Rented in your name.
6857951 6861387 - You have jobs, a life.<br />- You work nights because you can't sleep.
6861521 6865158 - Or you stay up and make soap.<br />- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
6865291 6868361 Technically, you are.<br />But it's all the same to her.
6870496 6872899 Oh, my God.
6873032 6875201 Now you see our dilemma.
6875335 6877537 She knows too much.
6878404 6883576 I think we're gonna have to talk about<br />how this might compromise our goals.
6883910 6885945 What... what are you saying?
6886079 6890216 This is bullshit. This is bullshit!<br />I'm not listening to this.
6890350 6893019 - You are insane!<br />- No. You're insane.
6893152 6895922 And we simply do not have time<br />for this crap.
6898157 6904964 <i>It's called a changeover. The movie goes</i><br /><i>on, nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>
6917944 6921447 - Sir! Are you checking out?<br />- Yeah. Bill me.
6921581 6925318 I need you to initial<br />this list of phone calls, please.
6928421 6932458 - When were these made?<br />- Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
6937931 6942435 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier every</i><br /><i>night? Have I been sleeping later?</i>
6943970 6947407 <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>
6950610 6952679 Is anybody here?
6954681 6957150 <i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>
6958651 6961254 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
6964157 6966125 Oh, my God.
6969228 6971564 - <i>1888.</i><br />- Who am I calling?
6971698 6975501 <i>1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.</i>
6975635 6978171 <i>Hello? Hello?</i>
6978304 6981007 1888 Franklin Street?
6981140 6983176 <i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>
6985545 6988181 - <i>Hello?</i><br />- Yeah, yeah.
6988314 6990683 I need to talk to your supervisor<br />right away.
6991017 6993019 - Speaking.<br />- OK, listen to me.
6993152 6996222 Something terrible<br />is about to happen to your building.
6996356 6998658 <i>It's under control, sir.</i>
6998992 7002395 - Excuse me?<br />- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
7015575 7018177 Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
7019579 7022615 Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7022749 7027153 Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking<br />broom! They almost broke my arm!
7027286 7030056 They were burning their fingertips<br />with lye.
7030189 7033659 It'll take a tremendous act of faith<br />on your part, but hear me out.
7033793 7037764 - Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />- A little more faith than that.
7042101 7046205 - I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.<br />- You have every right to be...
7046339 7048274 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7048408 7051811 Sir, anything you order<br />is free of charge, sir.
7052145 7054580 - Why is it free of charge?<br />- Don't ask.
7054714 7056182 Whatever.
7056315 7061187 I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken,<br />a baked potato, chocolate chiffon pie.
7061320 7063322 Clean food, please.
7063456 7066426 In that case, sir,<br />I advise against the clam chowder.
7066559 7068594 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7070163 7072398 You got about 30 seconds.
7075101 7077737 I know I've been acting very strange,<br />OK?
7078071 7082809 - I know it seems there's two sides to me...<br />- Two sides? You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
7083142 7086179 I deserved that.<br />But I realized something important.
7086312 7087313 What?
7087447 7092718 The full extent of our relationship wasn't clear<br />to me until now, for reasons I won't go into.
7092852 7095455 - I know I haven't treated you well.<br />- Whatever.
7095588 7100493 No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!<br />Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
7100626 7102728 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
7102862 7107300 What I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7108401 7110803 - You do?<br />- I really do.
7111137 7116309 I care about you, I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7116442 7118644 Your life is in danger.
7120179 7122815 - What?<br />- You need to leave town for a while.
7123149 7127320 - Get out of any major city. Go camping...<br />- You're an insane person.
7127453 7130756 - I've involved you in something terrible.<br />- No. Shut up!
7130890 7133493 - You're not safe.<br />- Shut up!
7135628 7139665 - Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />- I know you did.
7139799 7145605 There are things about you I like.<br />You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
7145738 7148808 But... you're intolerable.
7149142 7154680 You have very serious emotional problems<br />for which you should seek professional help.
7154814 7159418 - I know, and I'm sorry.<br />- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.
7160453 7163189 I can't do this anymore.
7163322 7165791 I can't. I won't.
7167493 7172765 - I'm gone.<br />- You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7175501 7177870 - Marla, you don't understand!<br />- Leave me alone!
7178204 7179705 I am trying to protect you!
7179839 7182842 - I never want to see you again!<br />- If that's what it takes...
7183176 7185211 Wait right here.
7189182 7191584 Hold it right there! Shut up!
7191717 7195955 Take this money and get on this bus.<br />I promise I will never bother you again.
7196289 7197590 Shut up!
7197723 7200860 Please get on the bus.<br />Please get on the bus.
7202695 7205598 - Why are you doing this?<br />- They think you're a threat.
7205731 7209802 I can't explain now. Trust me. If I see<br />where you're going, you won't be safe.
7209936 7212738 I'm not paying this back.<br />I consider it asshole tax.
7212872 7216509 Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities<br />for a couple of days, OK?
7216642 7218744 Tyler...
7219312 7223282 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7236662 7239365 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7239498 7242235 I am the leader<br />of a terrorist organization
7242368 7247273 responsible for numerous acts of<br />vandalism and assault all over this city.
7247406 7251244 In the metropolitan area,<br />we had probably 200 members.
7251377 7254981 {\an8}Chapters have sprung up<br />in five or six other major cities already.
7255314 7258317 This is a tightly regimented organization
7258451 7263923 with many cells capable of operating<br />independent of central leadership.
7264257 7269862 Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.<br />That's our headquarters.
7269996 7275768 In the back, buried in the garden,<br />you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7276569 7278838 In the basement, you'll find bathtubs
7278971 7284577 that have been used very recently<br />to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7284710 7289415 I believe the plan is to blow up the<br />headquarters of these credit-card companies
7289548 7291584 and the TRW building.
7292952 7296389 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit-card companies?
7296522 7300760 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7300893 7302928 You'll create total chaos.
7304597 7308834 Keep him talking.<br />I need to make a phone call.
7318711 7321580 I really admire what you're doing.
7322415 7325851 - What?<br />- You're a brave man to order this.
7325985 7327753 You're a genius, sir.
7327887 7332925 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7333059 7335728 we gotta get his balls.
7335861 7338931 - Don't fight.<br />- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
7339065 7342435 - It'll set quite an example.<br />- You're making a big mistake!
7342568 7344970 - You said you'd say that.<br />- I'm not Tyler Durden!
7345104 7347606 You told us you'd say that too.
7347740 7349742 All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7349875 7354447 Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct<br />order. We're aborting this mission now.
7354580 7357416 You said you would definitely say that.
7358818 7360553 Let me go!
7361787 7365791 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7367026 7368728 Is somebody timing this?
7368861 7371764 Keep your mouth shut.
7371897 7373933 Shit!
7376635 7379839 - Some of this information checks out.<br />- Uh-huh?
7379972 7383642 - Let's go to that house on Paper Street.<br />- Be right there.
7383776 7385144 Hey, wait!
7385478 7386545 - Got him?<br />- I got him.
7386679 7388514 Sir, we have to do this.
7388647 7390983 - Stop fighting!<br />- Where's the rubber band?
7391117 7393719 Get away from me!<br />Drop that fucking knife!
7397490 7400693 Back up.<br />Face down on the floor right now!
7403028 7405097 Get down on the floor!
7409535 7413672 First person that comes out this door<br />gets a lead salad! Understand?
7437930 7440599 Get away! Stay away!
7453546 7455948 <i>I ran.</i>
7456081 7461587 <i>I ran until my muscles burned</i><br /><i>and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>
7462888 7464957 <i>Then I ran some more.</i>
7506232 7511003 What are you doing, running around<br />in your underpants? You look crazy!
7511136 7514139 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7514273 7519211 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
7567159 7568994 Oh, Christ.
7569128 7571030 Now what are you doing?
7571163 7573232 - I'm stopping this.<br />- Why?
7573566 7577570 - The greatest thing you've ever done.<br />- I can't let this happen.
7577703 7580072 There are 10 other bombs<br />in 10 other buildings.
7580205 7582641 Since when is Project Mayhem<br />about murder?
7582775 7587646 The buildings are empty. We're not<br />killing anyone. We're setting 'em free!
7587780 7591116 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7591250 7593919 You wanna make an omelet,<br />you gotta break eggs.
7594053 7597690 I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7604196 7607967 Wouldn't do that. Not unless<br />I knew which wires were what.
7608100 7609868 If you know, then I know.
7615341 7620946 Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />all day thinking about the wrong ones.
7628287 7629355 You think?
7631323 7633626 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7634059 7637329 Pull any one but the green one.
7641634 7644770 I asked you not to do that!
7646639 7648107 Fuck!
7649041 7651176 Tyler, get away from the van.
7653312 7656782 Tyler, I'm not kidding!<br />Get away from the van!
7656915 7658283 Goddammit!
7659351 7661987 Whoa! Whoa!
7664657 7665924 OK.
7666058 7669294 You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend
7669428 7672097 near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
7674233 7676035 Cool it, Tyler!
7689415 7692384 Aw, come on! Don't go!
7731056 7732257 What?
7778103 7781507 Three minutes. This is it.
7781840 7783809 The beginning.
7783942 7785844 Ground zero.
7785978 7790783 - <i>I think this is about where we came in.</i><br />- Want to say a few words for the occasion?
7790916 7793886 I'm sorry?
7794019 7796822 I still can't think of anything.
7798090 7800159 Ah. Flashback humor.
7805798 7808300 It's getting exciting now.
7809368 7813305 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
7814807 7818911 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7819044 7822014 One step closer<br />to economic equilibrium.
7836862 7839965 - Why is she here?<br />- I'm tying up loose ends.
7840098 7843101 Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
7843235 7848240 - I'm begging you, please don't do this.<br />- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
7848373 7851310 - This is what we want.<br />- No. I don't want this.
7851443 7857149 Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.<br />We have to forget about you.
7857282 7860085 - You're a voice in my head.<br />- You're a voice in mine!
7860219 7862955 You're a hallucination.<br />Why can't I get rid of you?
7863088 7866024 - You need me.<br />- No. I don't. I really don't any more.
7866158 7870329 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make me feel better.
7870462 7872931 - Take some responsibility.<br />- I do.
7873065 7876235 I am responsible for all of it,<br />and I accept that.
7876368 7880405 So, please, I'm begging you,<br />please call this off.
7882374 7884576 Have I ever let us down?
7886078 7888380 How far have you come because of me?!
7894253 7896288 I will bring us through this.
7896421 7900192 As always, I will carry you<br />kicking and screaming,
7900325 7902661 and in the end you will thank me.
7903228 7905597 Tyler. Tyler.
7905931 7909334 I'm grateful to you<br />for everything that you've done for me.
7909468 7912104 But this is too much. I don't want this.
7912237 7917075 What do you want? Your shit job back?<br />Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
7917209 7919278 Fuck you! I won't do it.
7920445 7924549 - This can't be happening.<br />- It's already done, so shut up!
7924683 7928253 - 60 seconds till CRI.<br />- No.
7930022 7933191 I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
7933325 7937162 You're not real. That gun...<br />that gun isn't even in your hand.
7938196 7940265 The gun's in my hand.
7945604 7948206 Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
7957149 7959651 Why do you wanna<br />put a gun to your head?
7960519 7962487 Not my head, Tyler.
7962621 7964489 Our head.
7966058 7968126 Interesting.
7971396 7973699 Where are you going with this,<br />IKEA boy?
7980238 7983241 Hey. It's you and me.
7986745 7988714 Friends?
7989614 7991249 Tyler,
7994353 7996688 I want you to really listen to me.
7997556 7999324 OK.
8000692 8002761 My eyes are open.
8020112 8022280 What's that smell?
8042501 8046271 - Where is everybody?<br />- Oh, no. What's going on?
8046405 8048106 Mr. Durden!
8048240 8050108 Oh, my God!
8050675 8052244 Sir!
8055380 8058517 Are you... are you all right, sir?
8058650 8062554 - Oh, yeah, I'm OK.<br />- You look terrible, sir. What happened?
8062687 8066625 - Oh, nothing. It's no problem.<br />- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
8066758 8070695 - You look awful. You need assistance.<br />- I'm fine.
8070829 8073532 Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
8075534 8077702 Ow! Stop it!
8077836 8080739 - Let her go.<br />- Christ Almighty!
8081573 8082841 You!
8083542 8085510 Hi, Marla.
8086211 8089181 Leave her with me.<br />I'll meet you downstairs.
8089314 8092551 - Are you sure?<br />- Yes, I'm sure.
8094119 8098290 You fucker! What sick fucking game<br />are you playing at, putting me on a...?
8098423 8100525 Oh, my God, your face!
8100659 8102260 Yeah, I know.
8107599 8110135 - What happened?<br />- Don't ask.
8110268 8112270 - You're shot.<br />- Yes, I'm shot.
8112404 8114139 Oh, my God.
8114272 8117275 - I can't believe he's standing.<br />- Tough motherfucker.
8121613 8123582 Who did this?
8123715 8125817 I did, actually.
8126151 8128186 Find some gauze.
8128854 8133658 - You shot yourself?<br />- Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.
8133792 8136161 I'm really OK.
8136761 8140232 Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
8152844 8156815 You met me<br />at a very strange time in my life.
