125200 128369 <i>People always ask me</i><br /><i>if I know Tyler Durden.</i>
128636 130238 Three minutes.
130371 132674 This is it. Ground zero.
132807 136344 Want to say a few words<br />for the occasion?
136477 139847 <i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,</i><br /><i>you speak only in vowels.</i>
139981 141516 I can't think of anything.
141649 145687 <i>For a second, I forget about</i><br /><i>Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>
145820 147822 <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>
147956 149958 It's getting exciting now.
150291 153361 <i>That old saying,</i><br /><i>how you always hurt the one you love </i>-
153494 155430 <i>well, it works both ways.</i>
155563 159701 <i>We have front-row seats</i><br /><i>for this theater of mass destruction.</i>
159834 162337 <i>The Demolitions Committee</i><br /><i>of Project Mayhem</i>
162470 166674 <i>wrapped the foundation columns of</i><br /><i>a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>
166808 169611 <i>In two minutes,</i><br /><i>primary charges will blow base charges</i>
169744 173681 <i>and a few square blocks will be reduced</i><br /><i>to smoldering rubble.</i>
173815 176784 <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>
176918 180355 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
180488 185727 <i>Suddenly I realize that all of this </i>-<br /><i>the gun, the bombs, the revolution </i>-
185860 189564 <i>has got something to do</i><br /><i>with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>
191432 193935 <i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>
194268 198339 <i>This was a support group</i><br /><i>for men with testicular cancer.</i>
198473 201676 <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,</i><br /><i>that was Bob.</i>
202443 203845 We're still men.
203978 206280 Yes, we're men.
206414 208483 Men is what we are.
208616 212854 <i>Bob had had his testicles removed.</i><br /><i>Then hormone therapy.</i>
212987 215957 <i>He developed bitch tits</i><br /><i>cos his testosterone was too high</i>
216291 217992 <i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>
218325 222396 - That was where I fit.<br />- They'll have to drain my pecs again.
222529 224464 <i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>
224598 227834 <i>that hung enormous,</i><br /><i>the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>
227968 230971 OK, you cry now.
231305 234574 <i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>
235008 237678 <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>
237811 240380 <i>I couldn't sleep...</i>
240514 242649 <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>
243684 245552 <i>Everything's far away.</i>
245686 247954 <i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>
248088 250090 <i>of a copy.</i>
252959 257931 <i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i><br /><i>it'll be corporations that name everything.</i>
258065 260434 <i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>
260567 262602 <i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>
262736 264738 <i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>
265405 268408 I need you out of town this week<br />to cover some red flags.
268542 271945 <i>It must have been Tuesday.</i><br /><i>He had on his cornflower-blue tie.</i>
272079 276717 You want me to deprioritize my reports<br />until you advise of a status upgrade?
276850 281455 Prioritize these. Here's your flight<br />coupons. Call me if there's any snags.
281588 285425 <i>He was full of pep.</i><br /><i>Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>
287594 292833 <i>Like so many others, I had become</i><br /><i>a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>
292966 297437 - I'd like Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.<br />- Please hold.
297571 303043 <i>If I saw something clever, a coffee table in</i><br /><i>the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.</i>
304077 306546 <i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>
306680 309082 <i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>
309416 313086 <i>Or the Ohamshab sofa</i><br /><i>with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>
313420 318425 <i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of</i><br /><i>environmentally friendly paper.</i>
318558 324464 <i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:</i><br /><i>"What kind of dining set defines me?"</i>
324598 329169 <i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes</i><br /><i>with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>
329503 334508 <i>proof they were crafted by the honest,</i><br /><i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>
334641 337577 - <i>Please hold.</i><br />- ..<i>wherever.</i>
337978 340046 <i>We used to read pornography.</i>
340180 342182 <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>
342516 347087 - No. You can't die from insomnia.<br />- What about narcolepsy?
347420 351057 I nod off, I wake up in strange places.<br />I have no idea how I got there.
351191 355028 - You need to lighten up.<br />- Can you please give me something?
355162 358832 <i>Red and blue Tuinals,</i><br /><i>lipstick-red Seconals...</i>
358965 363135 No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
363469 366806 Chew some valerian root<br />and get more exercise.
369842 373579 - Hey, come on. I'm in pain.<br />- You wanna see pain?
373712 378851 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesdays.<br />See the guys with testicular cancer.
378984 381020 That's pain.
396468 400472 I always wanted three kids.<br />Two boys and a girl.
400940 403909 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
404043 406779 We never could agree on anything.
407813 411851 Well, she had her first child last week.
411984 414019 A girl.
414854 417223 With her... with her new husband.
421594 423996 And thank God. You know?
424129 425798 I-I'm glad for her.
427199 430970 Because she deserves it.
434039 437142 Everyone, let's thank Thomas<br />for sharing himself with us.
437276 439712 Thank you, Thomas.
439845 442882 I look around this room,<br />and I see a lot of courage.
443015 445017 And that gives me strength.
445150 447553 We give each other strength.
447686 449622 It's time for the one-on-ones.
449755 454860 So let's all of us follow Thomas's<br />example and really open ourselves up.
454994 457563 Could you find a partner?
459732 462301 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>
463802 467206 <i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>
469141 472611 <i>Knees together.</i><br /><i>Those awkward little steps.</i>
477950 480319 - My name is Bob.<br />- Bob?
480653 483055 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>
483188 486625 <i>You know that chest expansion</i><br /><i>program on late-night TV?</i>
486759 488127 <i>That was his idea.</i>
488260 490696 I was a juicer.
490829 493966 You know - using steroids.
494099 498070 Diabonal and... Wisterol.
498203 502608 Oh, they use that on racehorses,<br />for Chrissakes.
502741 507012 And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
508346 513351 my two grown kids<br />won't even return my phone calls.
514819 519190 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty</i><br /><i>make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>
521726 524329 Go ahead... Cornelius.
524662 526698 You can cry.
541012 545049 <i>And then... something happened.</i><br /><i>I let go.</i>
545183 546851 That's really good.
546985 548820 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>
548953 551923 <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>
553791 555960 <i>I found freedom.</i>
556094 559364 <i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>
560298 562367 It's OK.
564769 567238 <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>
570642 573111 <i>I became addicted.</i>
586858 591729 <i>If I didn't say anything,</i><br /><i>people always assumed the worst.</i>
595433 598670 <i>They cried harder... then I cried harder.</i>
607712 612116 Now we're going to open the green door,<br />the heart chakra...
612250 614285 <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>
614419 618022 <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>
618156 622026 <i>I was the warm little center that</i><br /><i>the life of this world crowded around.</i>
622460 627098 Imagine your pain<br />as a white ball of healing light.
627231 631135 It moves over your body, healing you.
631269 634272 Now keep this going.<br />Remember to breathe.
634405 638242 And step forward<br />through the back door of the room.
638376 640812 Where does it lead?
640945 643047 To your cave.
643181 646984 Step forward into your cave.
647118 649120 That's right.
649253 653256 <i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>
653390 657761 <i>and you're going to find</i><br /><i>your power animal.</i>
659863 661131 Slide.
672209 674277 <i>Every evening I died.</i>
675412 678515 <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>
678849 680884 <i>Resurrected.</i>
682886 687057 <i>Bob loved me because he thought</i><br /><i>my testicles were removed too.</i>
687190 692095 <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i><br /><i>ready to cry.</i>
692229 694865 <i>This was my vacation.</i>
698001 701371 <i>And she... ruined everything.</i>
701505 703807 This is cancer, right?
706543 711481 <i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i><br /><i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>
711815 713817 <i>She was a liar.</i>
713950 715952 <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>
716086 719856 <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,</i><br /><i>my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>
719990 723827 <i>Then at Hope,</i><br /><i>my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>
723960 728899 <i>And again at Seize The Day,</i><br /><i>my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>
731201 734437 <i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>
734571 737140 <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>
737274 739943 <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>
740076 745815 <i>I couldn't cry.</i><br /><i>So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>
756927 759496 <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>
759829 762866 <i>after we open our heart chakras,</i><br /><i>when it's time to hug,</i>
762999 765368 <i>I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer</i><br /><i>and scream:</i>
765502 769472 Marla, you liar! You big tourist!<br />I need this! Now, get out!
771541 774010 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>
774144 775979 <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>
776112 779549 <i>When you have insomnia,</i><br /><i>you're never really asleep</i>
779883 782085 <i>and you're never really awake.</i>
784254 789459 To begin tonight's communion,<br />Chloe would like to say a few words.
789593 791628 <i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>
792862 795632 <i>Chloe looked the way</i><br /><i>Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>
795966 800002 <i>if you made it walk around a party</i><br /><i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>
800135 802371 Well, I'm still here.
802504 805341 But I don't know for how long.
805474 809178 That's as much certainty<br />as anyone can give me.
809311 811981 But I've got some good news.
812114 815017 I no longer have any fear of death.
818387 822191 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
823225 825527 No one will have sex with me.
826428 831433 I'm so close to the end, and all I want<br />is to get laid for the last time.
831567 834970 I have pornographic movies<br />in my apartment,
835104 839008 - and lubricants and amyl nitrite.<br />- Thank you, Chloe.
839141 841977 Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
842111 844913 Thank you, Chloe.
846315 850419 Now, let's ready ourself<br />for guided meditation.
852254 855591 You're standing<br />at the entrance of your cave.
855924 858961 You step inside your cave<br />and you walk...
859094 863399 <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>
863532 865167 <i>Marla.</i>
865301 867303 <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>
867436 870673 <i>that would heal if you could stop</i><br /><i>tonguing it, but you can't.</i>
871006 875577 ..deeper into your cave as you walk.
875711 880015 <i>You feel</i><br /><i>a healing energy all around you.</i>
881050 884086 <i>Now find your power animal.</i>
887489 889058 Slide.
892962 895731 OK. Let's partner up.
896065 898300 Pick someone special to you tonight.
904473 906008 Hey.
907042 909111 - We need to talk.<br />- Sure.
914283 915985 - I'm onto you.<br />- What?
916118 919688 Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
920022 921056 Sorry?
921190 925594 In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia<br />Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
925728 929331 But you're not dying<br />the way Chloe back there is dying.
929465 931200 So?
931333 933335 So you're a tourist.
933469 937673 I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,<br />I saw you at tuberculosis.
938007 940009 I saw you at testicular cancer!
940142 942143 I saw you practicing this.
942276 944212 - Practicing what?<br />- Telling me off.
944345 948182 Is it going as well as you hoped...<br />"Rupert"?
948750 951652 - I'll expose you.<br />- Go ahead. I'll expose you.
951786 955723 Come together. Let yourselves cry.
962730 967301 - Oh, God. Why are you doing this?<br />- Cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.
967435 972707 Look, this is important. These are my<br />groups. I've been coming for over a year.
973041 976144 - Why do you do it?<br />- I don't know.
976277 980148 When people think you're dying,<br />they really listen to you instead of...
980281 983384 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
984419 986821 Yeah. Yeah.
987622 990525 Share yourself, completely.
991359 994429 You don't want to get into this.<br />It becomes an addiction.
994562 996731 - Really?<br />- I'm not kidding.
997065 1000168 I can't cry if another faker is present,<br />and I need this.
1000301 1002737 So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
1003071 1006507 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.<br />It's not my problem.
1008810 1011312 Wait a second. Hold on.
1011446 1015516 We'll split up the week, OK?<br />You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
1015650 1018586 You take tuberculosis.<br />My smoking doesn't go over at all.
1018719 1022256 Good. Fine.<br />Testicular cancer should be no contest.
1022390 1026160 Technically, I have more right to be<br />there. You still have your balls.
1026294 1029130 - You're kidding.<br />- I dunno. Am I?
1029263 1030565 No. No.
1030698 1033334 - What do you want?<br />- I'll take the parasites.
1033468 1036237 You can't have both.<br />Take the blood parasites.
1036370 1040575 - I want brain parasites.<br />- I'll take blood, I want brain dementia.
1040708 1043444 - I want that.<br />- You can't have the whole brain.
1043578 1046114 So far, you have four. I only have two.
1046247 1050118 OK. Take both the parasites.<br />They're yours.
1050251 1052453 Now we both have three...
1056124 1058459 Hey! You left half your clothes.
1074375 1078613 - What, are you selling those?<br />- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
1078746 1083351 We each have three. That's six. What about<br />the seventh day? I want bowel cancer.
1083484 1085486 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>
1085620 1090757 - No. No. I want bowel cancer.<br />- That's your favorite too?
1090891 1094794 - Tried to slip it by me, eh?<br />- Look, we'll split it.
1094928 1098198 Take the first and third Sunday<br />of the month.
1100267 1102335 Deal.
1103904 1107641 - Looks like this is goodbye.<br />- Let's not make a big thing out of it.
1107774 1110343 How's this for not making a big thing?
1114814 1117350 Hey, Marla! Marla!
1118885 1122422 - Maybe we should exchange numbers.<br />- Should we?
1122556 1124658 We might wanna switch nights.
1125892 1127294 OK.
1132699 1134868 <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>
1136636 1140440 <i>Marla's philosophy of life</i><br /><i>was that she might die at any moment.</i>
1140574 1142909 <i>The tragedy, she said,</i><br /><i>was that she didn't.</i>
1143243 1145612 It doesn't have your name!<br />Who are you?
1145745 1151484 Cornelius? Rupert? Travis? Any of<br />the stupid names you give each night?
1154721 1157290 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>
1157424 1159593 <i>SFO. LAX.</i>
1160727 1166299 <i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i><br /><i>Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>
1166433 1170003 <i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.</i><br /><i>Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>
1170337 1173440 Check-in for that flight<br />isn't for another two hours.
1173573 1177477 <i>This is your life,</i><br /><i>and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>
1177611 1180580 <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>
1181915 1185752 <i>If you wake up at a different time,</i><br /><i>in a different place,</i>
1185885 1188588 <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>
1189656 1192959 <i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>
1193293 1197631 <i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving</i><br /><i>cream, single pat of butter.</i>
1198331 1200533 <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>
1200667 1206539 <i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample</i><br /><i>package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>
1207907 1212712 <i>The people I meet on each flight,</i><br /><i>they're single-serving friends.</i>
1213713 1218752 <i>Between takeoff and landing, we have</i><br /><i>our time together, but that's all we get.</i>
1218885 1220787 <i>Welcome!</i>
1222656 1226960 <i>On a long enough time line, the</i><br /><i>survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>
1227294 1230829 <i>I was a recall coordinator.</i><br /><i>My job was to apply the formula.</i>
1230963 1234066 The infant went through the windshield.<br />Three points.
1234400 1238437 <i>A new car built by my company</i><br /><i>leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>
1238570 1240639 <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>
1240773 1245744 The teenager's braces are stuck to the<br />ashtray. Make a good anti-smoking ad.
1245878 1248881 <i>The car crashes and burns</i><br /><i>with everyone trapped inside.</i>
1249014 1251717 <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>
1251850 1257089 Father must've been huge. See where the<br />fat burned to the seat? Polyester shirt?
1257423 1258924 Very modern art.
1259058 1261827 <i>Take the number of vehicles</i><br /><i>in the field, A.</i>
1261960 1264663 <i>Multiply it by the probable rate</i><br /><i>of failure, B.</i>
1264797 1268567 <i>Multiply the result by</i><br /><i>the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>
1268701 1270803 <i>A x B x C...</i>
1270936 1272438 equals X.
1272571 1277710 If X is less than the cost of a recall,<br />we don't do one.
1278544 1282915 - Are there a lot of these accidents?<br />- You wouldn't believe.
1284583 1286952 Which car company do you work for?
1288053 1290122 A major one.
1291657 1295561 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply</i><br /><i>on takeoff or landing,</i>
1295694 1299064 <i>I prayed for a crash</i><br /><i>or a midair collision.</i>
1299398 1300999 <i>Anything.</i>
1309975 1313746 <i>Life insurance pays off triple</i><br /><i>if you die on a business trip.</i>
1316715 1320753 "If you are seated<br />in an emergency exit row
1320886 1325657 and feel unable or unwilling to perform<br />the duties listed on the safety card,
1325791 1330062 please ask a flight attendant<br />to reseat you."
1330396 1334133 - It's a lot of responsibility.<br />- Wanna switch seats?
1334466 1337770 No. I'm not sure<br />I'm the man for that particular job.
1337903 1342141 An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet.<br />Mm-hm.
1342474 1345043 The illusion of safety.
1345177 1347713 Yeah. I guess so.
1347846 1350549 You know why<br />they put oxygen masks on planes?
1350682 1354486 - So you can breathe.<br />- Oxygen gets you high.
1355587 1358991 In a catastrophic emergency,<br />you take giant panic breaths.
1359124 1364596 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.<br />You accept your fate.
1364730 1366765 It's all right here.
1367533 1369902 Emergency water landing, 600mph.
1370035 1372905 Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
1373772 1376073 That's, um...
1376207 1378609 That's an interesting theory.
1380945 1383481 - What do you do?<br />- What do you mean?
1383614 1388052 - What do you do for a living?<br />- So you can pretend you're interested?
1390788 1392123 OK.
1392456 1395126 You have a kind of<br />sick desperation in your laugh.
1398529 1400598 We have the exact same briefcase.
1402099 1403234 Soap.
1403568 1407071 - Sorry?<br />- I make and I sell soap.
1407205 1410007 The yardstick of civilization.
1410141 1412043 <i>And this is how I met...</i>
1412176 1413978 "Tyler Durden."
1414111 1419250 You know if you mix gasoline and frozen<br />orange juice, you can make napalm?
1419584 1422486 - No, I did not. Is that true?<br />- That's right.
1422620 1426057 One can make all kinds of explosives<br />using simple household items.
1426190 1428893 - Really?<br />- If one were so inclined.
1433865 1438936 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting<br />single-serving friend I've ever met.
1440538 1444909 - Everything on a plane's single-serving.<br />- Oh, I get it. Very clever.
1445042 1446677 Thank you.
1447511 1449614 How's that working out for you?
1449747 1451716 - What?<br />- Being clever.
1452783 1457121 - Great.<br />- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
1458256 1463661 Now, a question of etiquette. As I pass,<br />do I give you the ass or the crotch?
1470701 1472937 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>
1473070 1477241 <i>Airlines have this policy</i><br /><i>about vibrating luggage.</i>
1484949 1486284 Was it ticking?
1486617 1489687 Throwers don't worry.<br />Modern bombs don't tick.
1489820 1492924 - Sorry. Throwers?<br />- Baggage handlers.
1493791 1497995 But when a suitcase vibrates,<br />the throwers have to call the police.
1498129 1500598 My suitcase was vibrating?
1500731 1506203 Nine times out of ten it's an electric<br />razor, but... every once in a while...
1508940 1511008 it's a dildo.
1511809 1515846 It's company policy never to imply<br />ownership in the event of a dildo.
1515980 1521952 We have to use the indefinite article -<br />"a dildo", never "your dildo".
1522085 1524120 I don't own...
1526856 1533163 <i>I had everything in that suitcase. My</i><br /><i>CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>
1534898 1537167 <i>Never mind.</i>
1539069 1541838 Hey! That's my car!
1548678 1553783 <i>Home was on the 15th floor of a filing</i><br /><i>cabinet for widows, young professionals.</i>
1553917 1555919 <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>
1556052 1559689 <i>A foot of concrete's important</i><br /><i>when your next-door neighbor</i>
1559823 1562325 <i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>
1562659 1566296 <i>Or when a blast of debris</i><br /><i>that used to be your personal effects</i>
1566629 1570633 <i>blows out of your windows</i><br /><i>and sails flaming into the night.</i>
1577007 1579242 <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>
1592122 1594157 There's... nothing up there.
1594290 1597761 You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
1606302 1609672 Do you have somebody you can call?
1609806 1614077 <i>How embarrassing.</i><br /><i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>
1624187 1631194 <i>Police later told me the pilot light might</i><br /><i>have gone out, letting out a bit of gas.</i>
1631327 1636099 <i>That could have slowly filled the condo</i><br /><i>- 1700 square feet with high ceilings </i>-
1636232 1638101 <i>for days and days.</i>
1645341 1649179 <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor</i><br /><i>could have clicked on.</i>
1650947 1652315 <i>Yeah?</i>
1655385 1658154 <i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>
1667329 1671200 <i>If you ask me now,</i><br /><i>I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>
1713342 1715511 - Hello?<br />- <i>Who's this?</i>
1717479 1719948 - Tyler?<br />- <i>Who is this?</i>
1720082 1721316 Um...
1721450 1723552 We met... we met on the airplane.
1723886 1726421 We had the same suitcase?
1726555 1730526 - Uh... the clever guy.<br />- <i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>
1732528 1736431 I called a second ago. There was<br />no answer. I'm at a payphone.
1736565 1739835 <i>Yeah, I *69'd you.</i><br /><i>I never pick up my phone.</i>
1742304 1744373 - <i>So what's up?</i><br />- Uh...
1745107 1747109 Well...
1747242 1749211 You're not gonna believe this.
1751847 1753515 It could be worse.
1753849 1758220 A woman could cut off your penis<br />while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
1758353 1760522 There's always that.
1760856 1763859 It's just, when you buy furniture,<br />you tell yourself:
1763992 1769898 "That's the last sofa I'll need. Whatever<br />happens, I got that sofa problem handled."
1770032 1773335 I had it all.<br />I had a stereo that was very decent.
1773468 1776171 A wardrobe that was getting<br />very respectable.
1776305 1778941 I was close to being complete.
1779074 1783011 - Shit, man. And now it's all gone.<br />- All gone.
1783145 1784847 All gone.
1786381 1789117 Do you know what a duvet is?
1789251 1792521 - A comforter.<br />- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
1792855 1795090 Why do guys like us know<br />what a duvet is?
1795224 1799494 Is this essential to our survival<br />in the hunter-gatherer sense?
1799628 1801363 No.
1801496 1805868 - What are we, then?<br />- I dunno. Consumers.
1806001 1808003 Right. We're consumers.
1808136 1811906 We are by-products of a lifestyle<br />obsession.
1812039 1815543 Murder, crime, poverty.<br />These things don't concern me.
1815877 1818913 What concerns me are celebrity<br />magazines,
1819046 1821048 television with 500 channels,
1821182 1823184 some guy's name on my underwear.
1823317 1825987 Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
1826120 1828923 - Martha Stewart.<br />- Fuck Martha Stewart.
1829056 1832393 She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.<br />It's all going down.
1832526 1837031 So fuck off with your sofa units<br />and Strinne green stripe patterns.
1837164 1839567 I say never be complete.
1839901 1841669 I say stop being perfect.
1842003 1843971 I say let's evolve.
1844105 1846307 Let the chips fall where they may.
1848442 1852613 But that's me, and I could be wrong.<br />Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
1852947 1855283 It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.
1855416 1859153 You did lose a lot of versatile solutions<br />for modern living.
1859287 1862523 Fuck, you're right.<br />No, I don't smoke.
1865226 1869030 My insurance is probably gonna cover it,<br />so...
1872466 1876671 - What?<br />- Things you own end up owning you.
1880141 1882209 But do what you like, man.
1882977 1885346 Oh, it's late.
1886380 1889050 - Hey, thanks for the beer.<br />- Yeah, man.
1889183 1891285 I should find a hotel.
1891419 1893587 - Oh!<br />- What?
1893721 1894956 What?
1895089 1897058 - A hotel?<br />- Yeah.
1897191 1900194 - Just ask, man.<br />- What are you talking about?
1900328 1904598 Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer<br />and you still can't ask.
1906567 1909370 - What?<br />- You called cos you need a place to stay.
1909503 1912974 - Oh, hey. No, no, no.<br />- Yes, you did. So just ask.
1913107 1915543 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
1917378 1919547 Would... would that be a problem?
1919680 1922083 Is it a problem for you to ask?
1923117 1926387 - Can I stay at your place?<br />- Yeah.
1927154 1929223 Thanks.
1932593 1935563 - I want you to do me a favor.<br />- Yeah, sure.
1935696 1938232 I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1939166 1944438 - What?<br />- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
1944572 1947141 <i>Let me tell you a little</i><br /><i>about Tyler Durden.</i>
1948109 1952046 Tyler was a night person.<br />While the rest of us slept, he worked.
1952179 1955248 He had one part-time job<br />as a projectionist.
1955382 1958318 A movie doesn't come all on<br />one big reel. It comes on a few.
1958451 1962155 So someone has to switch the projectors<br />at the exact moment
1962288 1964591 that one reel ends<br />and the next one begins.
1964724 1969429 If you look, you can see little dots come<br />into the upper right corner of the screen.
1969562 1972465 In the industry,<br />we call them cigarette burns.
1972599 1974401 That's the cue for a changeover.
1974534 1979472 He flips the projectors, movie keeps<br />going and the audience has no idea.
1979606 1984778 - Why would anyone want this shit job?<br />- It affords him interesting opportunities.
1985111 1988214 Like splicing a frame of pornography<br />into family films.
1988348 1994287 When the snooty cat and the courageous<br />dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
1994421 1997824 you'll catch a flash<br />of Tyler's contribution to the film.
2004697 2010103 - Nobody knows they saw it, they did.<br />- A nice big cock.
2014741 2017577 Even a hummingbird<br />couldn't catch Tyler at work.
2022816 2027854 Tyler also worked sometimes as a<br />banquet waiter at the Pressman Hotel.
2032592 2036596 He was the guerrilla terrorist<br />of the food service industry.
2036729 2039099 Do not watch.<br />I cannot go when you watch.
2039232 2043770 Apart from seasoning lobster bisque, he<br />farted on meringues, sneezed on endives...
2044104 2046206 As for the cream of mushroom soup...
2046339 2050376 - Go ahead, tell 'em.<br />- You get the idea.
2050643 2053713 - You just want me to hit you?<br />- Come on. Do me this one favor.
2053847 2057283 - Why?<br />- Don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
2057417 2061354 - No. But that's a good thing.<br />- You can't know yourself if you haven't.
2061488 2063690 I don't wanna die without any scars.
2063823 2068261 - Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.<br />- Oh, God. This is crazy.
2068394 2070497 So go crazy! Let it rip.
2070630 2073299 - I don't know about this.<br />- I don't either.
2073433 2076436 Who gives a shit? No one's watching.<br />What do you care?
2076569 2078872 This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
2079205 2081207 That's right.
2081341 2084477 - Where? Like, in the face?<br />- Surprise me.
2086613 2088681 This is so fucking stupid.
2099591 2103829 Motherfucker!<br />You hit me in the ear!
2104163 2107266 - Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.<br />- Ow! Christ!
2107399 2108767 Why the ear, man?
2108901 2111236 - I fucked it up.<br />- No, that was perfect.
2111370 2113605 Ugh! Agh!
2124183 2126285 No, it's all right.
2126952 2129488 It really hurts.
2129621 2131657 Right.
2131924 2136461 - Hit me again.<br />- No, you hit me. Come on!
2153412 2155814 We should do this again sometime.
2168660 2170829 - Where's your car?<br />- What car?
2181440 2185978 <i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,</i><br /><i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>
2186311 2188947 <i>It looked like it was waiting</i><br /><i>to be torn down.</i>
2189281 2191550 <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>
2191683 2196888 <i>There was no lock on the front door from</i><br /><i>when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>
2197022 2199024 <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>
2199358 2204429 <i>I didn't know if he owned it or was</i><br /><i>squatting. Neither would've surprised me.</i>
2205330 2207366 Yep. That's you.
2207499 2209901 That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
2210035 2212738 Yeah, thanks.
2212871 2215607 <i>What a shithole.</i>
2215741 2217909 <i>Nothing worked.</i>
2220279 2223749 <i>Turning on one light meant</i><br /><i>another light in the house went out.</i>
2223882 2227619 <i>There were no neighbors.</i><br /><i>Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>
2227753 2231723 <i>That fart smell of steam.</i><br /><i>The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>
2233525 2235827 Hey. What have we here?
2250675 2252777 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hey.
2264588 2267625 <i>Every time it rained,</i><br /><i>we had to kill the power.</i>
2267758 2271028 <i>By the end of the first month,</i><br /><i>I didn't miss TV.</i>

2328652 2331822 It's an article written<br />by an organ in the first person.
2331956 2333958 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
2334091 2338863 "Without me, Jack could not regulate his<br />heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."
2338996 2340998 There's a whole series of these.
2341132 2345569 "I Am Jill's Nipples."<br />"I Am Jack's Colon."
2345703 2348639 Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
2349907 2351742 Whoop! Agh!
2351876 2355813 <i>After fighting, everything else in life</i><br /><i>got the volume turned down.</i>
2355946 2359417 What?
2359550 2362953 - <i>You could deal with anything.</i><br />- Have you finished those reports?
2368492 2371028 If you could choose,<br />who would you fight?
2371162 2372930 I'd fight my boss, probably.
2373063 2375065 Really?
2375199 2378869 - Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?<br />- I'd fight my dad.
2379003 2380771 I don't know my dad.
2380905 2384675 I mean, I know him, but he left<br />when I was, like, six years old.
2384809 2389112 Married this other woman and had some<br />other kids. He did this every six years.
2389446 2394083 - He moves city and starts a new family.<br />- Fucker's setting up franchises.
2395718 2399522 My dad never went to college,<br />so it was real important that I go.
2399656 2400990 That sounds familiar.
2401124 2404961 So I graduate. I call him up long-<br />distance and say, "Dad, now what?"
2405094 2407230 - He says, "Get a job."<br />- Same here.
2407564 2412101 Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.<br />"Dad, now what?"
2412235 2414771 He says, "I dunno. Get married."
2416639 2418908 You can't get married.

2454978 2456980 <i>polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>
2457113 2462085 <i>I should've been looking for a new condo,</i><br /><i>haggling with my insurance company.</i>
2462218 2467590 <i>I should have been upset about</i><br /><i>my nice flaming little shit - but I wasn't.</i>
2467724 2471594 The premise of cybernetting an office<br />is make things more efficient.
2471728 2474731 <i>Monday mornings,</i><br /><i>all I thought about was next week.</i>
2474864 2477834 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
2477967 2479002 Absolutely.
2479135 2482272 Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
2482605 2485208 Because waste is a thief.
2485542 2488578 I showed this to my man here.<br />You liked it, didn't you?
2492715 2496886 <i>You can swallow a pint of blood</i><br /><i>before you get sick.</i>
2497620 2501691 <i>It was right in everyone's face.</i><br /><i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>
2501824 2506729 <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i><br /><i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>
2517640 2520743 Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
2541897 2545000 Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
2566054 2569391 <i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules</i><br /><i>that he and I decided.</i>
2569725 2571693 Gentlemen!
2571827 2573862 Welcome to Fight Club.
2575964 2580636 The first rule of Fight Club is<br />you do not talk about Fight Club.
2580769 2583639 The second rule of Fight Club is...
2583772 2587075 you do not talk about Fight Club!
2587209 2592280 Third rule of Fight Club:<br />someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
2592414 2594683 the fight is over.
2594816 2597686 Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
2597819 2602257 Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
2602391 2604926 Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
2605060 2609865 Seventh rule: fights will go on<br />as long as they have to.
2611833 2618840 And the eighth and final rule: if this is<br />your first night, you have to fight.
2623945 2625981 <i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>
2626114 2630686 <i>couldn't remember whether</i><br /><i>you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>
2631687 2636858 <i>Ricky was a god for ten minutes when</i><br /><i>he trounced the maitre d' of a food court.</i>
2639261 2644433 <i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the</i><br /><i>flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling.</i>
2647402 2650706 <i>Or the wet choke</i><br /><i>when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>
2650839 2652708 Stop!
2652841 2655477 <i>You weren't alive anywhere</i><br /><i>like you were there.</i>
2655811 2661183 <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours</i><br /><i>between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>
2661316 2666088 <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good</i><br /><i>fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>
2666221 2670492 <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not</i><br /><i>who you were in the rest of the world.</i>
2670826 2674996 <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first</i><br /><i>time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>
2675130 2677965 <i>After a few weeks,</i><br /><i>he was carved out of wood.</i>
2678833 2681969 If you could fight any celebrity,<br />who would you fight?
2682103 2686006 - Alive or dead?<br />- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
2686140 2689210 Hemingway. You?
2689910 2693047 Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
2694982 2698352 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>
2698486 2702423 <i>Everywhere we went,</i><br /><i>we were sizing things up.</i>
2705893 2708295 <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>
2708429 2712433 <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein</i><br /><i>or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>
2712766 2715469 Is that what a man looks like?
2715803 2718405 Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
2718539 2720541 Now, self-destruction...
2720875 2722843 Excuse me.
2757344 2760114 <i>Fight Club wasn't about</i><br /><i>winning or losing.</i>
2760247 2762583 <i>It wasn't about words.</i>
2764552 2770191 <i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,</i><br /><i>like at a Pentecostal church.</i>
2774828 2776864 - Is that it?<br />- Stop!
2776997 2779833 <i>When the fight was over,</i><br /><i>nothing was solved.</i>
2779967 2781835 <i>But nothing mattered.</i>
2781969 2784004 Cool.
2785573 2788042 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>
2788175 2791412 Hey, man. How about next week?
2791545 2793547 How about next month?
2793881 2797218 Irvine, you're in the middle.<br />New guy, you too.
2799320 2801188 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>
2801322 2803924 He fell down some stairs.
2804058 2806093 I fell down some stairs.
2808262 2812466 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut</i><br /><i>your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>
2812600 2815202 OK. Any historical figure.
2815936 2819506 - I'd fight Gandhi.<br />- Good answer.
2820441 2822642 - How about you?<br />- Lincoln.
2822976 2824978 - Lincoln?<br />- Mm-hm.
2825111 2829015 Big guy, big reach.<br />Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
2829148 2831184 Fuck!
2832385 2836022 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
2844230 2848101 - Hello?<br />- <i>Where've you been the last eight weeks?</i>
2848234 2849435 <i>Marla?</i>
2852672 2855541 - How did you find me?<br />- <i>You left a forwarding number.</i>
2855675 2859012 I haven't seen you<br />at any support groups.
2859145 2862015 <i>We split 'em up.</i><br /><i>That was the idea. Remember?</i>
2862148 2864951 Yeah, but you haven't been<br />going to yours.
2865084 2868421 - How do you know?<br />- I cheated.
2868554 2870390 I found a new one.
2871024 2873226 - Really?<br />- It's for men only.
2873359 2874961 Like the testicle thing?
2875094 2877130 Wah!
2879465 2883236 - Look, this is a bad time.<br />- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
2883369 2886239 - Some really fucked-up people.<br />- I'm on my way out.
2886372 2889309 Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
2889442 2893446 I took what was left of a bottle.<br />It might have been too much.
2893579 2897517 <i>Picture Marla Singer throwing herself</i><br /><i>around her crummy apartment.</i>
2897650 2902188 This isn't a for-real suicide.<br />It's probably a cry for help.
2902322 2903589 <i>This could go on for hours.</i>
2903723 2908995 - So you're staying in tonight?<br />- Do you wanna hear me describe death?
2909128 2912665 <i>Do you wanna listen</i><br /><i>and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>
2914734 2917603 <i>Have you ever heard</i><br /><i>a death rattle before?</i>
2943429 2948701 <i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for</i><br /><i>two months, his door was never closed.</i>
2954640 2960279 - You won't believe the dream I had last night.<br />- I hardly believe anything from last night.
2970122 2972090 What are you doing here?
2976228 2979364 - What?<br />- This is my house. What're you doing here?
2981666 2983668 Fuck you!
2998383 3001653 Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
3002654 3005791 Limber, though. Silly cooze.
3007459 3011396 I come in last night. Phone's off the<br />hook. Guess who's on the other end.
3011530 3014199 <i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>
3017068 3020071 <i>Have you ever heard</i><br /><i>a death rattle before?</i>
3020205 3022808 Do you think it'll live up to its name?
3023141 3027112 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>
3030115 3034085 <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>
3034219 3038557 <i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>
3038690 3042260 <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i><br /><i>think it was a bad thing</i>
3042394 3044796 <i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>
3045130 3049734 ..<i>five, four, three...</i>
3049868 3052103 Hang on.
3056575 3058844 You got here fast.
3061179 3063548 Did I call you?
3063682 3065383 Huh?
3073492 3076428 The mattress is all sealed<br />in slippery plastic.
3079598 3082767 Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
3085403 3088807 Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
3100752 3104356 - Hey, where's 513?<br />- End of the hall.
3105190 3108860 The girl who lives there<br />used to be a charming, lovely girl.
3109194 3111262 She has lost faith in herself.
3111395 3114198 - Miss Singer, let us help you!<br />- She's a monster!
3114331 3118369 - You have every reason to live.<br />- She's infectious human waste!
3118502 3122306 - Miss Singer!<br />- Good luck trying to save her!
3126944 3131582 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
3132883 3135686 You're gonna have to keep me up...
3135819 3137821 all night.
3137955 3140357 Un-fucking-believable.
3140491 3142560 <i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>
3142693 3147197 - You know what I mean. You fucked her.<br />- No, I didn't.
3147331 3150301 - Never?<br />- No.
3150434 3153704 - You're not into her, are you?<br />- No! God, not at all.
3153837 3156473 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>
3156607 3160311 - Are you sure? You can tell me.<br />- Believe me, I'm sure.
3160444 3163781 - <i>Put a gun to my head, spray my brains.</i><br />- That's good.
3163914 3168552 She's a predator posing as a house pet.<br />Stay away from that one.
3168686 3172356 The shit that came out of<br />this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
3172489 3173958 My God.
3174291 3177528 I haven't been fucked like that<br />since grade school.
3177661 3179964 - Eugh!<br />- How could Tyler not go for that?
3180297 3183667 <i>The other night, he was</i><br /><i>splicing sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>
3183801 3186570 Marla doesn't need a lover,<br />just a caseworker.
3186704 3189340 And a wash.<br />This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
3189473 3192843 <i>She invaded my support groups</i><br /><i>and now my home.</i>
3192977 3195012 Hey, hey. Sit down.
3199249 3202920 - I can't have you talking to her about me.<br />- Why would I talk to her?
3203253 3209360 You say anything about me or what goes<br />on in this house to anybody, we're done.
3209493 3211261 - Now, promise me.<br />- OK.
3211395 3212896 - You promise?<br />- I promise.
3213030 3215566 - Promise.<br />- I just said, I promise! What...
3215699 3218602 That's three times you promised.
3219603 3223641 <i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes</i><br /><i>and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>
3223774 3225476 <i>none of this would've happened.</i>
3230414 3233884 Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
3240891 3243427 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>
3243560 3247398 <i>On the third floor</i><br /><i>where I might not have heard them.</i>
3248032 3250300 <i>But I didn't.</i>
3269986 3271754 Ow!
3273690 3277794 - What are you doing?<br />- Just going to bed.
3278795 3281898 - You wanna finish her off?<br />- Ooh!
3282832 3286502 - No. No, thank you.<br />- I found the cigarettes.
3287503 3289806 - Who were you talking to?<br />- Shut up.
3289939 3293743 <i>I became the calm little center</i><br /><i>of the world.</i>
3293876 3295912 <i>I was the Zen master.</i>
3301017 3303619 <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>
3303753 3306856 <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>
3306989 3309559 Is that your blood?
3310760 3311928 Some of it, yeah.
3312061 3314797 You can't smoke in here.
3315965 3319569 Take the rest of the day off.<br />Come back Monday with clean clothes.
3319702 3321537 Get yourself together.
3321671 3326776 <i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i><br />"<i>Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>
3326909 3331114 "<i>Yes, I'm comfortable with that.</i><br /><i>I am enlightened."</i>
3333049 3337754 <i>You give up the condo life and</i><br /><i>all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>
3337887 3341491 <i>go live in a dilapidated house</i><br /><i>in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>
3341624 3345495 and you have to come home to this.
3356005 3360409 - Hello?<br />- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
3360543 3364447 <i>We have new information about</i><br /><i>the incident at your former condo.</i>
3364580 3366916 - Yes?<br />- I don't know if you're aware,
3367049 3370052 but someone sprayed Freon<br />into your front-door lock.
3370186 3373422 <i>They used a chisel</i><br /><i>to shatter the cylinder.</i>
3373556 3376993 - No, I wasn't aware of that.<br />- <i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>
3377126 3381697 - Does this sound strange to you?<br />- Yes, sir. Very strange.
3381831 3383466 - The dynamite...<br />- Dynamite?
3383599 3387703 ..left a residue of ammonium<br />oxalate potassium perchloride.
3387837 3391140 - Do you know what this means?<br />- No. What does it mean?
3391474 3393209 It means it was home-made.
3394477 3397613 I'm sorry. This is just coming<br />as quite a shock to me, sir.
3397747 3403118 Whoever set this dynamite could've blown<br />your pilot light days before the explosion.
3403451 3406454 - The gas was just a detonator.<br />- Who'd do such a thing?
3406588 3409090 - <i>I'll ask the questions.</i><br />- Tell him.
3409224 3413028 "The liberator who destroyed my<br />property realigned my perceptions."
3413161 3418133 - Excuse me. Are you there?<br />- Yes. Hard to know what to make of this.
3418466 3422771 Have you recently made enemies who might<br />have access to home-made dynamite?
3422904 3425073 - Enemies?<br />- "I reject civilization,
3425207 3427209 especially material possessions."
3427542 3430178 - <i>Son, this is serious.</i><br />- Yes, I know it's serious.
3430512 3432914 - I mean that.<br />- Yes, it's very serious.
3433048 3439554 Look, nobody takes this more seriously<br />than me. That condo was my life. OK?
3439688 3442224 I loved every stick of furniture<br />in that place.
3442557 3445527 <i>That was not just a bunch of stuff</i><br /><i>that got destroyed.</i>
3445660 3447996 - It was me!<br />- I thank the Academy.
3448129 3452601 - <i>Is this not a good time for you?</i><br />- Just tell him you fucking did it!
3452734 3456571 Tell him you blew it all up!<br />That's what he wants to hear.
3456705 3460775 - Are you still there?<br />- Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
3460909 3465614 No. I may need to talk to you, so you<br />let me know if you're gonna leave town.
3465747 3468016 - <i>OK?</i><br />- OK.
3471286 3475257 <i>Except for their humping, Tyler</i><br /><i>and Marla were never in the same room.</i>
3475590 3478593 <i>My parents pulled</i><br /><i>this exact same act for years.</i>
3478727 3482264 The condom is the glass slipper<br />of our generation.
3482597 3485267 You slip one on<br />when you meet a stranger.
3485600 3490105 You dance all night,<br />then you throw it away.
3490238 3493041 The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
3494075 3495677 What?
3500549 3503151 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
3503285 3505120 It was worth every penny.
3505253 3507289 It's a bridesmaid's dress.
3509190 3513295 Someone loved it intensely for one day,
3514329 3515864 then tossed it.
3517766 3519801 Like a Christmas tree.
3519935 3522003 So special.
3522871 3525307 Then... bam!
3525640 3528009 It's on the side of the road.
3528143 3530745 Tinsel still clinging to it.
3532247 3539254 Like a sex-crime victim, underwear<br />inside out, bound with electrical tape.
3539788 3542257 Well, then, it suits you.
3542591 3544858 You can borrow it sometime.
3551765 3553934 Get rid of her.
3554068 3556704 - What? You get rid of her!<br />- Don't mention me.
3556837 3560941 <i>I am six years old again,</i><br /><i>passing messages between parents.</i>
3564044 3566981 - It's time you left.<br />- Don't worry, I'm leaving.
3567114 3572019 - Not that we don't love your visits.<br />- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
3576323 3577758 Thanks. Bye.
3592740 3595643 You kids!
3595776 3598679 Why do you still waste time with her?
3599713 3603250 I'll say this about Marla.<br />At least she's trying to hit bottom.
3603384 3604785 And I'm not?
3604918 3608422 Sticking feathers up your butt<br />does not make you a chicken.
3608756 3610324 What are we doing tonight?
3610658 3613694 Tonight... we make soap.
3613827 3617798 - Really?<br />- To make soap, first we render fat.
3637117 3642690 The salt balance has to be just right, the<br />best fat for soap comes from humans.
3642823 3646427 - Wait. What is this place?<br />- A liposuction clinic.
3653967 3655969 Aha! Pay dirt!
3656103 3660974 Richest, creamiest fat in the world.<br />The fat of the land!
3666013 3669083 No! Don't pull it.
3673754 3676323 - Oh, God!<br />- I'll get another one.
3683263 3687768 As the fat renders, the tallows float<br />to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
3687901 3691504 - It's hard to imagine you a Boy Scout.<br />- Keep stirring.
3693973 3697376 Once the tallow hardens,<br />you skim off a layer of glycerin.
3697510 3699979 Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
3700113 3704917 If you then add sodium nitrate<br />and sawdust, you got dynamite.
3705051 3707854 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
3707987 3709989 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>
3710123 3714393 Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner<br />when washed in one part of the river.
3714527 3716129 - You know why?<br />- No.
3719966 3722835 Humans were once sacrificed<br />on the hills above.
3722969 3727039 Bodies burnt, water seeped<br />through the ashes to create lye.
3727173 3729108 This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
3729242 3733379 Once it mixed with the melted body fat,<br />a soapy discharge crept into the river.
3733513 3735548 May I see your hand, please?
3743055 3744223 What is this?
3744357 3746959 - This is a chemical burn.<br />- Agh! Aaagh!
3747093 3750429 It'll hurt more than you've ever<br />been burned and leave a scar.
3750563 3754000 <i>If meditation worked for cancer,</i><br /><i>it could work for this.</i>
3754133 3756903 - Don't shut the pain out.<br />- Oh, God!
3757537 3762074 The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,<br />like the first monkey shot into space.
3762208 3765144 Without pain or sacrifice,<br />we would have nothing.
3765278 3768147 <i>I tried not to think</i><br /><i>of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>
3768281 3771350 Stop it! This is your pain,<br />this is your burning hand.
3771484 3774420 I'm going to my cave<br />to find my power animal.
3774554 3778257 No! Don't deal with this<br />the way those dead people do! Come on!
3778391 3782361 - I get the point!<br />- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
3785965 3789235 It's the greatest moment of your life,<br />and you're missing it!
3789368 3790903 I am not...
3791037 3793973 Shut up! Our fathers<br />were our models for God.
3794106 3798144 If our fathers bailed,<br />what does that tell you about God?
3798845 3804016 Listen to me. You have to consider the<br />possibility that God does not like you.
3804150 3807520 He never wanted you.<br />In all probability, he hates you.
3807854 3811257 This is not the worst thing<br />that can happen. We don't need him!
3811390 3814293 - I agree!<br />- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
3814427 3816963 We are God's unwanted children?<br />So be it!
3817096 3821100 - I'm getting water!<br />- You can use water and make it worse or...
3821234 3822468 Look at me!
3822602 3826172 - ..or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.<br />- Please let me up!
3826305 3828307 First, you have to give up.
3828441 3831143 First, you have to know - not fear -
3831277 3834212 know that someday, you're gonna die.
3834346 3836481 You don't know how this feels!
3841386 3846591 It's only after we've lost everything<br />that we're free to do anything.
3846925 3848960 OK.
3862974 3867212 Congratulations.<br />You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
3869681 3875020 <i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at</i><br /><i>$20 a bar. God knows what they charged.</i>
3875153 3879124 - This is the best soap.<br />- Why, thank you, Susan.
3879257 3880692 <i>It was beautiful.</i>
3881026 3884696 <i>We were selling rich women</i><br /><i>their own fat asses back to them.</i>
3886197 3887933 <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>
3888066 3890468 <i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>
3890602 3894005 "The first rule of Fight Club<br />is don't talk about Fight Club"?
3894139 3897509 <i>I'm half-asleep again.</i><br /><i>I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>
3897642 3900645 "The second rule..." Is this yours?
3900979 3902013 Huh?
3902147 3905517 Pretend you're me.<br />Make a managerial decision.
3905650 3908186 You find this. What would you do?
3912691 3914659 Well, I gotta tell you,
3914993 3918363 I'd be very, very careful<br />who you talk to about that.
3918496 3921967 Because the person who wrote that<br />is dangerous.
3922100 3926438 And this button-down, Oxford-cloth<br />psycho might just snap
3926571 3929407 and then stalk from office to office
3929541 3934512 with an Armalite AR10 carbine<br />gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
3934646 3939617 pumping round after round<br />into colleagues and co-workers.
3939751 3943188 This might be someone<br />you've known for years.
3943321 3947225 Someone very, very close to you.
3947359 3949761 <i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>
3951329 3953365 <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>
3953498 3957102 Or maybe you shouldn't bring me<br />every piece of trash you pick up.
3960472 3963775 - Compliance and Liability.<br />- My tit's gonna rot off.
3965643 3968413 Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
3974119 3978089 - What do you mean?<br />- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
3978223 3982593 - Go to a hospital.<br />- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
3982726 3985095 I don't know about this, Marla.
3985229 3986296 Please?
3986430 3990401 <i>She didn't call Tyler.</i><br /><i>I'm neutral in her book.</i>
3992436 3996440 That's nice. Taking food<br />to Mrs... Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
3996573 3998575 Where are they, exactly?
3998709 4002746 Tragically, they're dead.<br />I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
4003080 4005082 - No, no.<br />- I got one for you.
4005215 4007251 Thanks for the thought.
4008552 4010754 What happened to your hand?
4011088 4013190 Oh, nothing.
4013690 4016260 - Right there?<br />- Mm.
4016393 4019063 - Feel anything?<br />- No.
4019196 4021832 Well, make sure.
4022166 4025402 - OK, I'm pretty sure.<br />- You feel nothing?
4026336 4028405 No, nothing.
4029406 4032509 Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
4033644 4036780 - No problem.<br />- I wish I could return the favor.
4037114 4039116 Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
4039249 4042586 - I could check your prostate.<br />- I think I'm OK.
4042719 4044755 Well, thanks, anyway.
4049760 4052262 - Are we done?<br />- Yeah, we're done.
4052396 4054465 See you... around.
4071615 4073650 Cornelius?
4073784 4076220 Cornelius!
4076353 4078856 It's me! Bob!
4079189 4080524 Hey, Bob.
4084361 4087464 - We all thought you were dead.<br />- No, no. Still here.
4087598 4091235 - How are you, Bob?<br />- Better than I've been in my whole life.
4091368 4096540 - Really? Still Remaining Men Together?<br />- No. I got something much better now.
4096673 4099243 Really? What is it?
4099376 4101211 Well...
4101345 4106150 The first rule is,<br />I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4106283 4107651 And the second rule is...
4107784 4109586 I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4109720 4113657 - And the third rule is...<br />- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
4114391 4116460 Look at my face, Bob.
4118295 4120531 That's fucking great.
4120664 4124367 - I've never seen you there.<br />- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4124500 4127770 - I go Saturday.<br />- Congratulations.
4128771 4130806 Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?
4130940 4133609 Have you heard about the guy<br />that invented it?
4133743 4136612 - Yeah, actually...<br />- I hear all kinds of things.
4136746 4140816 Supposedly,<br />he was born in a mental institution
4140950 4144587 and he sleeps only one hour a night.
4144720 4147790 - He's a great man.<br />- Oh...
4147924 4150660 Do you know about Tyler Durden?
4174850 4177420 I didn't hurt you, did I?
4177553 4179855 Actually, you did.
4179989 4183626 Thank you for this.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4183759 4185995 <i>Fight Club.</i>
4186329 4188364 <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>
4188631 4190666 <i>Our gift to the world.</i>
4190800 4193869 I look around, I look around,<br />I see a lot of new faces.
4195571 4197740 Shut up!
4198808 4204280 Which means a lot of people have been<br />breaking the first rules of Fight Club.
4210953 4215625 I see in Fight Club the strongest<br />and smartest men who've ever lived.
4215758 4220463 I see all this potential.<br />And I see it squandered.
4221297 4224433 Goddammit,<br />an entire generation pumping gas,
4224567 4226269 or waiting tables.
4226402 4228671 Slaves with white collars.
4230806 4233843 Advertising has us chasing cars<br />and clothes,
4233976 4238514 working jobs we hate<br />so we can buy shit we don't need.
4241284 4245988 We're the middle children of history,<br />men. No purpose or place.
4246322 4248357 We have no Great War,
4248491 4250526 no Great Depression.
4252328 4254864 Our great war is a spiritual war.
4254997 4257967 Our great depression is our lives.
4262071 4265841 We've all been raised on TV to believe<br />that one day we'd be millionaires
4265975 4267976 and movie gods and rock stars.
4268310 4270312 But we won't.
4270445 4273048 We're slowly learning that fact.
4273381 4276051 And we're very, very pissed off.
4276384 4278420 Yeah!
4280889 4284492 First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
4289864 4291866 Who are you?
4292000 4294669 - Who am I?<br />- Yeah.
4295937 4299407 There's a sign on the front<br />that says Lou's Tavern.
4299541 4303445 I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
4303978 4305547 Tyler Durden.
4308650 4311653 Who told you motherfuckers<br />you could use my place?
4311786 4314556 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
4314689 4319828 Irvine's at home with a broken<br />collarbone. He don't own this place. I do.
4322130 4324999 - How much money does he get?<br />- There is no money.
4325133 4326935 - Really?<br />- Free to all.
4327068 4329838 - Ain't that something.<br />- It is, actually.
4329971 4332474 Look, stupid fuck!
4332607 4338480 - I want everybody out of here right now.<br />- Hey! You should join our club.
4338613 4341916 - Did you hear what I just said?<br />- You and your friend.
4343852 4346921 You hear me now?
4348089 4350158 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
4356765 4358466 Still not getting it.
4359834 4361603 Agh! OK, OK, I got it.
4361736 4364072 I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
4365807 4367976 Back! All of you!
4368777 4370845 Everybody back!
4378420 4380522 Ah, Lou!
4380655 4384159 Come on, man!<br />We really like this place.
4393968 4397172 - That's right, Lou. Get it out.<br />- Shut the fuck up.
4397505 4400775 Oh, yeah!
4403044 4405113 Is that fucking funny?
4414054 4417458 Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
4418125 4419893 Unbelievable.
4424064 4427000 - You don't know where I've been, Lou.<br />- Oh, my God!
4427134 4430003 You don't know where I've been!
4433073 4436109 Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
4436243 4441715 - Fucking use the basement! Christ!<br />- I want your word! I want your word!
4441849 4443817 On my mother's eyes.
4452926 4454995 Thanks, Lou.
4456263 4458532 You too, big guy.
4462503 4464571 We'll see you next week.
4479987 4484858 This week, each one of you<br />has a homework assignment.
4484992 4489563 You're gonna go out. You're gonna<br />start a fight with a total stranger.
4491798 4494601 You're gonna start a fight,
4494735 4496837 and you're gonna lose.
4498972 4500874 Excellent choice, sir.
4502676 4505746 Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
4505879 4508949 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>
4511718 4513654 What... Son of a bitch!
4513787 4518859 <i>Most people - normal people </i>-<br /><i>do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>
4519893 4521328 Excuse me!
4521662 4523664 You sprayed me with your hose.
4523797 4525165 That's not necessary.
4525299 4527200 Jay! Go call 911!
4530003 4532005 Put the hose down.
4532139 4534174 Stop it! Stop it!
4536777 4537811 Sorry.
4545152 4547588 You bastard!
4553226 4555796 We need to talk.
4557597 4559665 OK.
4560900 4562168 Where to begin?
4562301 4564971 With your constant absenteeism?
4565104 4567907 With your unpresentable appearance?
4568040 4572645 - You're up for review.<br />- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
4572778 4574647 - What?<br />- Let's pretend.
4574780 4578184 You're the Department<br />of Transportation, OK?
4578317 4583289 Someone informs you that this company<br />installs front-seat mounting brackets
4583623 4585358 that never pass collision tests,
4585691 4588961 brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
4589095 4594200 and fuel injectors<br />that explode and burn people alive.
4594333 4596168 What then?
4596302 4598838 - Are you threatening me?<br />- No...
4598971 4602375 - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!<br />- I have a better solution.
4602708 4605978 Keep me on the payroll<br />as an outside consultant
4606112 4612318 in exchange for my salary, my job will be<br />never to tell people things that I know.
4612652 4617089 I don't even have to come into the office.<br />I can do this job from home.
4617223 4622194 Who... who the fuck do you think<br />you are, you crazy little shit?
4626298 4629935 - Security!<br />- <i>I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>
4636676 4638044 Agh!
4639211 4641013 What the hell are you doing?
4650156 4652792 That hurt.
4654260 4656262 Why would you do that?
4656395 4659365 Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
4669909 4671944 What are you doing?
4672078 4674080 Oh, God, no! Please! No!
4674213 4678217 <i>For some reason,</i><br /><i>I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

4704309 4708880 <i>Under and behind and inside</i><br /><i>everything this man took for granted,</i>
4709013 4712317 <i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

4718423 4723228 <i>And right then,</i><br /><i>at our most excellent moment together...</i>
4724262 4728066 Thank God!<br />Please don't hit me again.

4835139 4838142 - Did you start that one?<br />- No, I thought you did.
4838276 4840645 No.

4891995 4893964 - Turn around.<br />- What are we doing?
4894097 4896366 - Homework assignment.<br />- What kind?
4896500 4898468 Human sacrifice.
4898602 4903540 - Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.<br />- It's a gun. Meet me in the back.

4976480 4979383 - Yeah. Animals and stuff.<br />- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
4979516 4982119 - So you need more schooling.<br />- Too much school.
4982252 4984554 - Would you rather be dead?<br />- No, please...
4984688 4989192 You'd rather die here, on your knees,<br />in the back of a convenience store?
4989326 4992261 No. Please, no.
4995498 4998234 I'm keeping your license.
4998367 5002138 Gonna check in on you.<br />I know where you live.
5002271 5006542 If you're not on your way to being a<br />veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.
5009178 5011447 Now, run on home.
5015384 5017386 Run, Forrest, run!
5019088 5021157 I feel ill.
5022525 5026495 - Imagine how he feels.<br />- Come on, this isn't funny!
5026629 5029131 What the fuck was the point of that?
5029265 5032735 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day<br />of Raymond K Hessel's life.
5033069 5037339 His breakfast will taste better than<br />any meal you and I have ever tasted.
5038674 5040709 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>
5040843 5043279 - Come on.<br />- <i>He had a plan.</i>
5043412 5046682 <i>And it started to make sense</i><br /><i>in a Tyler sort of way.</i>
5046816 5049785 <i>No fear. No distractions.</i>
5050119 5054323 <i>The ability to let that which</i><br /><i>does not matter truly slide.</i>
5067636 5069738 <i>You are not your job.</i>
5071674 5075177 You're not how much money<br />you have in the bank.
5076745 5079348 You're not the car you drive.
5079482 5083185 You're not the contents of your wallet.
5083319 5085688 You're not your fucking khakis.
5087490 5091627 You are the all-singing,<br />all-dancing crap of the world.
5099869 5102304 I'll be out of your way in a sec.
5103139 5105207 You don't have to go.
5106609 5108677 Whatever.
5109478 5112848 No, I mean... It's OK.
5122491 5125227 Are you still going to groups?
5125361 5127396 Yeah.
5128764 5130799 Chloe's dead.
5130933 5133802 Wow. Chloe.
5133936 5136271 When did that happen?
5136404 5138640 Do you care?
5138773 5141442 I dunno. I haven't thought about it<br />in a while.
5141576 5143778 Yeah, well...
5143912 5146948 It was the smart move on her part.
5148816 5150919 Listen, um...
5151252 5153688 What are you getting out of all this?
5153821 5155823 What?
5155957 5158927 I mean, all this. Why do you keep...?
5159260 5161296 Is this making you happy?
5162764 5164832 Yeah, well, sometimes.
5166601 5168670 I don't know. I don't understand.
5168803 5174542 Why does a weaker person need to latch<br />on to a strong person? What is that?
5174676 5176778 What do you get out of it?
5178746 5183751 No... That's not the same thing at all.<br />It's totally different with us.
5183885 5185587 "Us"?
5185720 5189457 - What do you mean by "us"?<br />- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
5189591 5192227 - Hear what?<br />- All that noise. Hold on.
5192360 5195597 No, wait! Don't change the subject!<br />I want to talk about this.
5195730 5198499 - You're not talking about me, are you?<br />- No.
5198633 5201936 - What?<br />- You playing doctor. What was going on?
5202270 5205406 - What are you talking about?<br />- Nothing. Nothing.
5205540 5207542 - I don't think so.<br />- What do you want?
5207675 5209978 - Look at me.<br />- No. What?
5211479 5214382 - What is that?<br />- It's nothing. Don't worry.
5214515 5217352 - My God. Who did this?<br />- A person.
5217485 5218653 Guy or girl?
5218786 5221322 - What do you care?<br />- What do you care if I ask?
5221456 5223458 - Leave me alone.<br />- You're afraid to say.
5223591 5225860 - I am not. Let me go.<br />- No! Talk to me.
5225994 5227629 Let go of me. Leave me alone!
5227762 5229897 - This conversation...<br />- This conversation...
5230031 5232600 - ..is over.<br />- ..is over.
5234502 5237272 I just can't win with you, can I?
5245480 5249651 Hey, this is getting a little old!
5249784 5251653 What is... what is all this?
5251786 5254422 What do you think?
5254856 5257058 Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
5257392 5258426 Hey!
5265867 5268836 Too young. Sorry.
5269737 5271472 What's all that?
5271606 5274876 Tell the applicant<br />if he's too young, too old or too fat.
5275009 5276344 Applicant?
5276477 5282416 If the applicant waits three days without food<br />or shelter, he may enter and begin training.
5282549 5284418 Training for what?
5289856 5294428 You think this is a game? You're<br />too young to train here, end of story.
5294561 5297898 Quit wasting our time.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
5301535 5303870 Bad news, friend.
5304004 5306707 It's not gonna happen.
5306840 5308975 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
5309109 5312612 It's not the end of the world.<br />Just... go away.
5313814 5315515 Go.
5315649 5320020 You're trespassing<br />and I will have to call the police.
5323423 5327728 Don't you look at me! You're<br />never getting in this fucking house!
5327861 5331098 Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!<br />Get off my porch!
5331431 5334468 <i>Sooner or later, we all became</i><br /><i>what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>
5334601 5337771 I'm gonna go inside<br />and I'm gonna get a shovel.
5345412 5349483 Got two black shirts?<br />Two pair of black pants?
5349616 5352419 - Yes, sir.<br />- One pair black boots? Black socks?
5352552 5353987 - Sir.<br />- One black jacket?
5354121 5356456 - Sir.<br />- $300 personal burial money?
5356590 5358091 Yes, sir.
5360427 5362496 All right.
5372506 5374574 You're too old, fat man.
5375542 5378812 Your tits are too big.<br />Get the fuck off my porch.
5385952 5388021 Bob! Bob!
5403503 5406039 Like a monkey<br />ready to be shot into space.
5406840 5408475 Space monkey.
5409176 5412712 Ready to sacrifice himself<br />for the greater good.
5418118 5421488 You are too fucking old, fatty!
5421621 5426125 And you... You're too fucking blond!
5426458 5428727 Get out of here, the both of you!
5429094 5430696 <i>And so it went.</i>
5430830 5433032 Listen up, maggots.
5433165 5435568 You are not special.
5435701 5439538 You are not a beautiful<br />or unique snowflake.
5439672 5443242 You are the same decaying organic<br />matter as everything else.
5443576 5445711 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>
5445845 5449915 <i>We are the all-singing,</i><br /><i>all-dancing crap of the world.</i>
5450049 5453652 <i>We are all part of the same</i><br /><i>compost heap.</i>
5455120 5458557 <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>
5458691 5462094 <i>To what purpose?</i><br /><i>For what greater good?</i>
5465564 5467633 <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>
5470970 5477977 No, no, no, no. When he was, like, "You<br />are not your job," I was, like, "Yeah!"
5480546 5483883 - Hey, what's all this?<br />- Hey!
5485284 5487086 OK!
5487219 5489555 - What's going on?<br />- We're celebrating.
5489688 5492057 - What are we celebrating?<br />- Go on.
5496128 5498197 - Hey.<br />- Let me get that for you.
5502868 5506772 <i>Same great taste.</i><br /><i>Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>
5507573 5509909 Shh!
5510042 5514780 <i>Investigators are on the scene.</i><br /><i>The police commissioner has arrived.</i>
5514914 5518117 <i>Could you tell us</i><br /><i>what you think has happened here?</i>
5518250 5522054 <i>We believe this is one of many</i><br /><i>recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>
5522187 5525991 <i>somehow related to</i><br /><i>underground boxing clubs.</i>
5526125 5529929 <i>We will be coordinating</i><br /><i>a rigorous investigation.</i>
5530062 5533332 <i>That was Commissioner Jacobs</i><br /><i>who just arrived on the scene</i>
5533666 5538771 - of a four-alarm fire that broke out...<br />- She's hot.
5538904 5540739 <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>
5541707 5543108 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
5544643 5546712 - Holy shit!<br />- Yeah!
5553619 5555955 What the fuck did you guys do?
5556088 5560125 <i>Arson investigators</i><br /><i>are on the premises...</i>
5564964 5569301 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions, sir.
5571970 5575273 <i>Police Commissioner Jacobs</i><br /><i>is on the scene...</i>
5575606 5579277 The victory in the war against crime<br />will not come overnight.
5579610 5583982 It will take dedication and commitment<br />and, most of all, cooperation.
5584115 5588119 Streets are safer now.<br />There is hope in the inner city.
5588252 5591889 - However...<br />- I gotta take a piss.
5592023 5597128 These are the first steps in a long journey.<br />That is why we created Project Hope...
5597261 5598329 Bob.
5598663 5602367 ..helping others<br />with prevention and enforcement.
5602700 5607405 Project Hope'll be a joint effort between<br />the police and community leaders.
5607739 5611843 It will be a powerful new weapon<br />in the war against crime.
5657889 5662760 - Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.<br />- Man! His balls are ice-cold.
5663728 5666764 Hi. You're gonna call off<br />your rigorous investigation.
5666898 5669801 You will publicly state<br />there is no underground group,
5669934 5672470 or these guys are gonna take your balls.
5673371 5677208 They'll send one to the New York Times<br />and one to the LA Times.
5678309 5681979 Look, the people you are after<br />are the people you depend on.
5682113 5685917 We cook your meals. We haul your trash.<br />We connect your calls.
5686050 5689987 We drive your ambulances.<br />We guard you while you sleep.
5694158 5696994 Do not fuck with us.
5705937 5707738 Ball check!
5722085 5723987 Bob, this way.
5724888 5726323 Let's go.
5727324 5730527 <i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>
5730861 5732896 Hey!
5747277 5748512 Yeah!
5781411 5787150 <i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i><br /><i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>
5789519 5792355 <i>I wanted to open</i><br /><i>the dump valves on oil tankers</i>
5792489 5796026 <i>and smother all those French beaches</i><br /><i>I'd never see.</i>
5800130 5802566 <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>
5819182 5821585 Where did you go, psycho boy?
5823053 5825989 I felt like destroying<br />something beautiful.
5830093 5833563 - Get him to a fucking hospital.<br />- Yeah.
5844374 5848945 Don't worry, Mr. Durden.<br />Airport parking. Long term.
5849079 5851114 After you, Mr. Durden.
5852082 5854150 After you.
5871967 5874403 - Something on your mind, dear?<br />- No.
5874536 5877339 Yeah. Why wasn't I told<br />about Project Mayhem?
5877473 5881377 First rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not ask questions.
5881510 5885180 - Why wasn't I included in the beginning?<br />- Fight Club was the beginning.
5885314 5888350 Now it's left the basements<br />and it's Project Mayhem.
5888484 5893122 We started Fight Club together. Remember?<br />It's as much mine as it is yours.
5893255 5897393 - Is this about you and me?<br />- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
5897526 5899528 This does not belong to us.
5899662 5903465 - We are not special.<br />- Fuck that. You should have told me.
5904333 5906335 Hey, Tyler!
5908203 5910239 - Goddammit, Tyler!<br />- What do you want?
5910372 5913208 A statement of purpose?<br />Should I email you?
5913342 5916011 - Look...<br />- You decide your level of involvement!
5916145 5918614 I will! I wanna know certain things first!
5918947 5921417 - The first rule of Project Mayhem...<br />- Shut up!
5922685 5927022 - I wanna know what you're thinking.<br />- Fuck what you know!
5927156 5930426 Forget about what you think you know<br />about life, friendship,
5930559 5932594 and especially about you and me.
5934196 5937132 What is that supposed to mean? What...?
5939368 5941503 What are you doing?
5942971 5945207 What'll you wish you'd done<br />before you die?
5945341 5948143 - Paint a self-portrait.<br />- Build a house.
5948277 5950279 - And you?<br />- I don't know. Nothing.
5950412 5953115 - Get in the right lane.<br />- You have to know!
5953248 5955718 If you died now,<br />how would you feel about your life?
5956051 5960022 I don't know! Nothing good.<br />Is that what you want to hear me say?
5960155 5962324 - Come on!<br />- Not good enough.
5962458 5964993 Stop fucking around! Tyler!
5966195 5968397 Jesus Christ!
5969198 5971700 Goddammit! Goddammit! Fuck you!
5972034 5976205 Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!<br />I am sick of all your shit!
5977172 5979241 OK, man. OK.
5980042 5982444 - Quit screwing around. Steer!<br />- Look at you!
5982578 5985314 - Steer!<br />- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
5985447 5990519 - Why? What are you talking about?<br />- Why'd you think I blew up your condo?
5991587 5992621 What?
5992755 5997159 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.<br />It's not a goddamn seminar.
5997292 6000496 Stop trying to control everything<br />and just let go!
6003364 6006300 - Let go!<br />- All right. Fine.
6007201 6009137 Fine.
6067428 6070731 <i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>
6070865 6073568 <i>This must have been</i><br /><i>what all those people felt like</i>
6073701 6076804 <i>before I filed them</i><br /><i>as statistics in my reports.</i>
6077138 6079173 Goddamn!
6082410 6085546 We've just had a near-life experience!
6090451 6095590 In the world I see, you're stalking elk<br />through the damp canyon forests
6095723 6098459 around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
6100461 6105166 You'll wear leather clothes<br />that will last you the rest of your life.
6105299 6110338 You'll climb the thick kudzu vines<br />that wrap the Sears Tower.
6110471 6114809 And when you look down,<br />you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
6115142 6121816 laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool<br />lane of some abandoned superhighway.
6133561 6135763 Feel better, champ.
6153680 6154915 <i>And then...</i>
6155248 6156550 Tyler?
6156683 6158718 ..<i>Tyler was gone.</i>
6166793 6168862 <i>Was I asleep?</i>
6170330 6171364 <i>Had I slept?</i>
6171498 6174467 You are not<br />a beautiful, unique snowflake...
6174601 6177470 <i>The house had become a living thing,</i>
6177604 6180540 <i>wet inside from so many people</i><br /><i>sweating and breathing.</i>
6180674 6186846 - We're all part of the same compost heap...<br />- <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>
6187948 6189716 <i>Planet Tyler.</i>
6189849 6194621 <i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside</i><br /><i>this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>
6194754 6197924 You can't be smoking!<br />You know how much ether is in here?
6198258 6201628 <i>Cooking and working</i><br /><i>and sleeping in teams.</i>
6204331 6205899 Hang on a second.
6225685 6228555 It's under control, sir.
6230457 6231791 Where's Tyler?
6231925 6234861 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem<br />is you do not...
6234995 6236930 Right. OK.
6239466 6241534 <i>I'm all alone.</i>
6241668 6245372 <i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>
6245505 6247674 <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>
6251845 6256516 <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem,</i><br /><i>only Tyler knows.</i>
6256650 6260420 <i>The second rule</i><br /><i>is you do not ask questions.</i>
6262622 6265392 Get the fuck away from me!<br />Get the fuck away!
6266559 6268962 Who are all these people?
6272932 6275735 The Paper Street Soap Company.
6277871 6279506 Can I come in?
6282776 6284844 He's not here.
6284978 6286479 What?
6287547 6290984 Tyler isn't here.
6291317 6293585 Tyler went away.
6293719 6295754 Tyler's gone.
6311670 6314540 Jesus! Get some help!
6326351 6330589 Two gunshot wounds coming through!<br />Make some fucking room!
6330723 6332558 What happened? What happened?
6332691 6337096 We were on assignment. We were<br />supposed to kill two birds with one stone.
6337429 6339431 Destroy a piece of corporate art...
6339565 6341967 Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
6343869 6345804 ..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
6352144 6354613 We had it all worked out, sir.
6362755 6365958 - It went smooth until...<br />- Police! Freeze!
6366091 6368861 - What?<br />- They shot Bob.
6370462 6373398 - They shot him in the head.<br />- Fucking pigs!
6378103 6380105 Oh, God!
6380439 6384109 - Those motherfuckers!<br />- You morons.
6384443 6387446 You run around in ski masks<br />trying to blow things up?
6387579 6390582 What did you think was gonna happen?
6393085 6396655 OK, quick! We gotta<br />get rid of the evidence - this body!
6396789 6398957 - Bury him.<br />- What?
6399091 6401927 Take him to the garden and bury him.
6402060 6406632 - Come on, people, let's go!<br />- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
6406765 6410869 What are you talking about? This<br />isn't fucking evidence. This is a person.
6411003 6414106 He's my friend and you're<br />not burying him in the garden!
6414439 6417176 He was killed<br />serving Project Mayhem, sir.
6417509 6419478 - This is Bob.<br />- But, sir, in...
6419611 6422080 in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
6422214 6428153 You listen to me. This is a man and he<br />has a name, it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
6428487 6429521 Robert Paulsen?
6429655 6434660 He's a man, and he's dead now because<br />of us. Do you understand that?
6434793 6436128 I understand.
6438529 6444702 In death, a member of Project Mayhem<br />has a name.
6444836 6447004 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6447538 6449607 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6450241 6452977 His name... is Robert Paulsen.
6454178 6456881 His name is Robert Paulsen.
6457014 6462753 - Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.<br />- His name is Robert Paulsen.
6462887 6465923 Shut up! This is all over with!
6501192 6504829 - Tyler?<br />- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
6504962 6506631 I need to see you...
6511002 6515773 <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's</i><br /><i>used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>
6515907 6520578 <i>I didn't know how, but I could look at 50</i><br /><i>different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>
6520711 6524649 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.<br />It's very important that I talk to him.
6525049 6527118 I wish I could help you,
6527251 6528753 sir.
6534692 6537595 <i>Every city I went to,</i>
6537728 6539997 <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>
6540131 6542566 <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>
6543267 6545102 Hey! Hey!
6545236 6546837 Taxi!
6546971 6551676 Look at my face. I'm a member. Now,<br />I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
6551809 6555313 I'm not exposed to bespeak<br />any such information to you,
6555646 6560184 nor would I, even if I had said<br />information at this juncture, be able.
6561752 6564722 - You're a moron.<br />- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
6565957 6570995 <i>Tyler had been busy, setting</i><br /><i>up franchises all over the country.</i>
6573798 6578135 <i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>
6578269 6581838 <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>
6581972 6584374 - We've just heard the stories.<br />- What stories?
6584708 6589245 - Nobody knows what he looks like.<br />- He has plastic surgery every three years.
6589379 6591781 That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
6591915 6596653 - Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?<br />- Is Mr. Durden building an army?
6596786 6601024 <i>I was living in a state</i><br /><i>of perpetual déjà vu.</i>
6601157 6604728 <i>Everywhere I went,</i><br /><i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>
6604861 6607764 <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>
6608832 6610934 <i>The smell of dried blood.</i>
6612002 6614971 <i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>
6615105 6618408 <i>That aroma of old sweat,</i><br /><i>like fried chicken.</i>
6618742 6622946 <i>The feel of a floor still warm</i><br /><i>from a fight the night before.</i>
6623079 6625982 <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>
6628685 6633923 His name is Robert Paulsen.<br />His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
6636860 6638928 Welcome back, sir.
6639963 6641865 How have you been?
6642866 6644868 Do you know me?
6645001 6648438 - Is this a test, sir?<br />- No. This is not a test.
6649439 6652175 You were in here last Thursday.
6652308 6654044 Thursday?
6654177 6658848 You were standing where you are now,<br />asking how good security is.
6658982 6661418 It's tight as a drum, sir.
6663119 6665288 Who do you think I am?
6665922 6669993 - Are you sure this isn't a test?<br />- No, this is not a test.
6670994 6673430 You're Mr. Durden.
6673763 6676132 You're the one who gave me this.
6677033 6681938 <i>Please return your seat backs</i><br /><i>to their full upright and locked position.</i>
6692382 6693917 - Yeah?<br />- <i>Marla, it's me.</i>
6694050 6696186 - Have we ever done it?<br />- Done what?
6696319 6699756 - Had sex.<br />- What kind of stupid question is that?
6699889 6702492 Stupid because the answer's yes<br />or because it's no?
6702826 6704828 - Is this a trick?<br />- No. I need to know...
6704961 6708832 You wanna know if I think<br />we were just having sex or making love?
6709365 6712202 - We did make love?<br />- Is that what you're calling it?
6712335 6715472 Just answer the question!<br />Did we do it or not?
6715805 6718341 You fuck me, then snub me.<br />You love me, you hate me.
6718475 6721244 You're sensitive,<br />then you turn into an asshole.
6721377 6723913 Does that describe our relationship,<br />Tyler?
6724047 6726349 <i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>
6726482 6728817 - What did you say?<br />- What is wrong with you?
6728951 6730953 - Say my name!<br />- Tyler Durden.
6731086 6733856 Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!<br />What's going on?
6733989 6736024 - I'm coming over!<br />- I'm not there!
6738026 6740062 You broke your promise.
6740195 6742531 - Jesus, Tyler.<br />- You talked to her about me.
6742865 6747436 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- I ask you for one thing. One thing.
6747769 6750906 Why do people think that I'm you?
6751039 6753075 Answer me!
6756211 6757279 Sit.
6760482 6763852 Answer me.<br />Why do people think I'm you?
6763986 6765521 I think you know.
6765854 6767789 - No, I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6767923 6771293 Why would anyone<br />possibly confuse you with me?
6771426 6773395 I... I don't know.
6778200 6780502 - You got it.<br />- No.
6780836 6783272 - Do not fuck with us!<br />- Say it.
6784573 6786842 Because...
6788110 6789244 Say it!
6791079 6793949 Because we're the same person.
6794082 6795117 That's right.
6795250 6797352 We are the all-singing, all-dancing...
6797486 6801190 - I don't understand this.<br />- You wanted a way to change your life.
6801323 6803559 You could not do this on your own.
6803892 6808030 All the ways you wish you could be -<br />that's me.
6808163 6810599 I look like you wanna look,<br />fuck like you wanna fuck,
6810933 6815971 I am smart, capable, most importantly,<br />I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
6816104 6817139 Oh, no.
6817272 6820108 - Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.<br />- What?
6820242 6824546 - This is impossible. This is crazy.<br />- People do it every day.
6824880 6828483 They talk to themselves.<br />They see themselves as they'd like to be.
6828617 6831553 They don't have the courage you have<br />to just run with it.
6835357 6838627 You still wrestle with it,<br />so sometimes you're still you.
6838961 6840562 We should do this again sometime.
6840896 6843498 Other times,<br />you imagine you're watching me.
6843632 6846168 If this is your first time,<br />you have to fight.
6846301 6850973 Little by little,<br />you're just letting yourself become...
6852007 6853342 Tyler Durden.
6853475 6856245 You are not your job<br />or how much money you have!
6856378 6858647 - No. You have a house.<br />- Rented in your name.
6858981 6862417 - You have jobs, a life.<br />- You work nights because you can't sleep.
6862551 6866188 - Or you stay up and make soap.<br />- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
6866321 6869391 Technically, you are.<br />But it's all the same to her.
6871525 6873928 Oh, my God.
6874061 6876230 Now you see our dilemma.
6876364 6878566 She knows too much.
6879433 6884605 I think we're gonna have to talk about<br />how this might compromise our goals.
6884939 6886974 What... what are you saying?
6887108 6891245 This is bullshit. This is bullshit!<br />I'm not listening to this.
6891379 6894048 - You are insane!<br />- No. You're insane.
6894181 6896951 And we simply do not have time<br />for this crap.
6899186 6905993 <i>It's called a changeover. The movie goes</i><br /><i>on, nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>
6918973 6922476 - Sir! Are you checking out?<br />- Yeah. Bill me.
6922610 6926347 I need you to initial<br />this list of phone calls, please.
6929450 6933487 - When were these made?<br />- Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
6938960 6943464 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier every</i><br /><i>night? Have I been sleeping later?</i>
6944999 6948436 <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>
6951639 6953708 Is anybody here?
6955710 6958179 <i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>
6959680 6962283 With enough soap,<br />one could blow up anything.
6965186 6967154 Oh, my God.
6970257 6972593 - <i>1888.</i><br />- Who am I calling?
6972727 6976530 <i>1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.</i>
6976664 6979200 <i>Hello? Hello?</i>
6979333 6982036 1888 Franklin Street?
6982169 6984205 <i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>
6986574 6989210 - <i>Hello?</i><br />- Yeah, yeah.
6989343 6991712 I need to talk to your supervisor<br />right away.
6992046 6994048 - Speaking.<br />- OK, listen to me.
6994181 6997251 Something terrible<br />is about to happen to your building.
6997385 6999687 <i>It's under control, sir.</i>
7000021 7003424 - Excuse me?<br />- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
7016603 7019205 Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
7020607 7023643 Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
7023777 7028181 Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking<br />broom! They almost broke my arm!
7028314 7031084 They were burning their fingertips<br />with lye.
7031217 7034687 It'll take a tremendous act of faith<br />on your part, but hear me out.
7034821 7038792 - Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.<br />- A little more faith than that.
7043129 7047233 - I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.<br />- You have every right to be...
7047367 7049302 I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
7049436 7052839 Sir, anything you order<br />is free of charge, sir.
7053173 7055608 - Why is it free of charge?<br />- Don't ask.
7055742 7057210 Whatever.
7057343 7062215 I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken,<br />a baked potato, chocolate chiffon pie.
7062348 7064350 Clean food, please.
7064484 7067454 In that case, sir,<br />I advise against the clam chowder.
7067587 7069622 No clam chowder. Thank you.
7071191 7073426 You got about 30 seconds.
7076129 7078765 I know I've been acting very strange,<br />OK?
7079099 7083837 - I know it seems there's two sides to me...<br />- Two sides? You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
7084170 7087207 I deserved that.<br />But I realized something important.
7087340 7088341 What?
7088475 7093746 The full extent of our relationship wasn't clear<br />to me until now, for reasons I won't go into.
7093880 7096483 - I know I haven't treated you well.<br />- Whatever.
7096616 7101521 No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!<br />Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
7101654 7103756 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
7103890 7108328 What I've come to realize<br />is that I really like you, Marla.
7109429 7111831 - You do?<br />- I really do.
7112165 7117337 I care about you, I don't want anything<br />bad to happen to you because of me.
7117470 7119672 Your life is in danger.
7121207 7123843 - What?<br />- You need to leave town for a while.
7124177 7128348 - Get out of any major city. Go camping...<br />- You're an insane person.
7128481 7131784 - I've involved you in something terrible.<br />- No. Shut up!
7131918 7134521 - You're not safe.<br />- Shut up!
7136656 7140693 - Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.<br />- I know you did.
7140827 7146633 There are things about you I like.<br />You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
7146766 7149836 But... you're intolerable.
7150170 7155708 You have very serious emotional problems<br />for which you should seek professional help.
7155842 7160445 - I know, and I'm sorry.<br />- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.
7161480 7164216 I can't do this anymore.
7164349 7166818 I can't. I won't.
7168520 7173792 - I'm gone.<br />- You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
7176528 7178897 - Marla, you don't understand!<br />- Leave me alone!
7179231 7180732 I am trying to protect you!
7180866 7183869 - I never want to see you again!<br />- If that's what it takes...
7184203 7186238 Wait right here.
7190209 7192611 Hold it right there! Shut up!
7192744 7196982 Take this money and get on this bus.<br />I promise I will never bother you again.
7197316 7198617 Shut up!
7198750 7201887 Please get on the bus.<br />Please get on the bus.
7203722 7206625 - Why are you doing this?<br />- They think you're a threat.
7206758 7210829 I can't explain now. Trust me. If I see<br />where you're going, you won't be safe.
7210963 7213765 I'm not paying this back.<br />I consider it asshole tax.
7213899 7217536 Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities<br />for a couple of days, OK?
7217669 7219771 Tyler...
7220339 7224309 You're the worst thing<br />that ever happened to me.
7237689 7240392 Hello. I need you to arrest me.
7240525 7243262 I am the leader<br />of a terrorist organization
7243395 7248300 responsible for numerous acts of<br />vandalism and assault all over this city.
7248433 7252271 In the metropolitan area,<br />we had probably 200 members.
7252404 7256008 Chapters have sprung up<br />in five or six other major cities already.
7256341 7259344 This is a tightly regimented organization
7259478 7264950 with many cells capable of operating<br />independent of central leadership.
7265284 7270889 Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.<br />That's our headquarters.
7271023 7276795 In the back, buried in the garden,<br />you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
7277596 7279865 In the basement, you'll find bathtubs
7279998 7285604 that have been used very recently<br />to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
7285737 7290442 I believe the plan is to blow up the<br />headquarters of these credit-card companies
7290575 7292611 and the TRW building.
7293979 7297416 Why these buildings?<br />Why credit-card companies?
7297549 7301787 If you erase the debt record,<br />then we all go back to zero.
7301920 7303955 You'll create total chaos.
7305623 7309860 Keep him talking.<br />I need to make a phone call.
7319737 7322606 I really admire what you're doing.
7323441 7326877 - What?<br />- You're a brave man to order this.
7327011 7328779 You're a genius, sir.
7328913 7333951 You said if anyone ever interferes<br />with Project Mayhem, even you,
7334085 7336754 we gotta get his balls.
7336887 7339957 - Don't fight.<br />- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
7340091 7343461 - It'll set quite an example.<br />- You're making a big mistake!
7343594 7345996 - You said you'd say that.<br />- I'm not Tyler Durden!
7346130 7348632 You told us you'd say that too.
7348766 7350768 All right. I am Tyler Durden.
7350901 7355473 Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct<br />order. We're aborting this mission now.
7355606 7358442 You said you would definitely say that.
7359844 7361579 Let me go!
7362813 7366817 Are you fucking out of your minds?<br />You're police officers!
7368052 7369754 Is somebody timing this?
7369887 7372790 Keep your mouth shut.
7372923 7374959 Shit!
7377661 7380865 - Some of this information checks out.<br />- Uh-huh?
7380998 7384668 - Let's go to that house on Paper Street.<br />- Be right there.
7384802 7386170 Hey, wait!
7386504 7387571 - Got him?<br />- I got him.
7387705 7389540 Sir, we have to do this.
7389673 7392009 - Stop fighting!<br />- Where's the rubber band?
7392143 7394745 Get away from me!<br />Drop that fucking knife!
7398516 7401719 Back up.<br />Face down on the floor right now!
7404054 7406123 Get down on the floor!
7410561 7414698 First person that comes out this door<br />gets a lead salad! Understand?
7438956 7441625 Get away! Stay away!
7454571 7456973 <i>I ran.</i>
7457106 7462612 <i>I ran until my muscles burned</i><br /><i>and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>
7463913 7465982 <i>Then I ran some more.</i>
7507257 7512028 What are you doing, running around<br />in your underpants? You look crazy!
7512161 7515164 No. I'm onto you.<br />I know what's going on here.
7515298 7520236 Come on, then. I got us a great place<br />to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
7568184 7570019 Oh, Christ.
7570153 7572055 Now what are you doing?
7572188 7574257 - I'm stopping this.<br />- Why?
7574591 7578595 - The greatest thing you've ever done.<br />- I can't let this happen.
7578728 7581097 There are 10 other bombs<br />in 10 other buildings.
7581230 7583666 Since when is Project Mayhem<br />about murder?
7583800 7588671 The buildings are empty. We're not<br />killing anyone. We're setting 'em free!
7588805 7592141 Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
7592275 7594943 You wanna make an omelet,<br />you gotta break eggs.
7595077 7598714 I'm not listening to you.<br />You're not even there.
7605220 7608991 Wouldn't do that. Not unless<br />I knew which wires were what.
7609124 7610892 If you know, then I know.
7616365 7621970 Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent<br />all day thinking about the wrong ones.
7629311 7630379 You think?
7632347 7634650 Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
7635083 7638353 Pull any one but the green one.
7642658 7645794 I asked you not to do that!
7647663 7649131 Fuck!
7650065 7652200 Tyler, get away from the van.
7654336 7657806 Tyler, I'm not kidding!<br />Get away from the van!
7657939 7659307 Goddammit!
7660375 7663011 Whoa! Whoa!
7665681 7666948 OK.
7667082 7670318 You are now firing a gun<br />at your imaginary friend
7670452 7673121 near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
7675257 7677059 Cool it, Tyler!
7690439 7693408 Aw, come on! Don't go!
7732080 7733281 What?
7779126 7782530 Three minutes. This is it.
7782863 7784832 The beginning.
7784965 7786867 Ground zero.
7787001 7791806 - <i>I think this is about where we came in.</i><br />- Want to say a few words for the occasion?
7791939 7794909 I'm sorry?
7795042 7797845 I still can't think of anything.
7799113 7801182 Ah. Flashback humor.
7806821 7809323 It's getting exciting now.
7810391 7814328 Two and a half.<br />Think of everything we've accomplished.
7815830 7819934 Out these windows, we will view<br />the collapse of financial history.
7820067 7823037 One step closer<br />to economic equilibrium.
7837885 7840988 - Why is she here?<br />- I'm tying up loose ends.
7841121 7844124 Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
7844258 7849263 - I'm begging you, please don't do this.<br />- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
7849396 7852333 - This is what we want.<br />- No. I don't want this.
7852466 7858172 Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.<br />We have to forget about you.
7858305 7861108 - You're a voice in my head.<br />- You're a voice in mine!
7861242 7863978 You're a hallucination.<br />Why can't I get rid of you?
7864111 7867047 - You need me.<br />- No. I don't. I really don't any more.
7867181 7871352 You created me. I didn't create some<br />loser alter ego to make me feel better.
7871485 7873954 - Take some responsibility.<br />- I do.
7874088 7877258 I am responsible for all of it,<br />and I accept that.
7877391 7881428 So, please, I'm begging you,<br />please call this off.
7883397 7885598 Have I ever let us down?
7887100 7889402 How far have you come because of me?!
7895275 7897310 I will bring us through this.
7897443 7901214 As always, I will carry you<br />kicking and screaming,
7901347 7903683 and in the end you will thank me.
7904250 7906619 Tyler. Tyler.
7906953 7910356 I'm grateful to you<br />for everything that you've done for me.
7910490 7913126 But this is too much. I don't want this.
7913259 7918097 What do you want? Your shit job back?<br />Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
7918231 7920300 Fuck you! I won't do it.
7921467 7925571 - This can't be happening.<br />- It's already done, so shut up!
7925705 7929275 - 60 seconds till CRI.<br />- No.
7931044 7934213 I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
7934347 7938184 You're not real. That gun...<br />that gun isn't even in your hand.
7939218 7941287 The gun's in my hand.
7946626 7949228 Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
7958171 7960673 Why do you wanna<br />put a gun to your head?
7961541 7963509 Not my head, Tyler.
7963643 7965511 Our head.
7967080 7969148 Interesting.
7972418 7974721 Where are you going with this,<br />IKEA boy?
7981260 7984263 Hey. It's you and me.
7987767 7989736 Friends?
7990636 7992271 Tyler,
7995375 7997710 I want you to really listen to me.
7998578 8000346 OK.
8001714 8003783 My eyes are open.
8021134 8023302 What's that smell?
8043522 8047292 - Where is everybody?<br />- Oh, no. What's going on?
8047426 8049127 Mr. Durden!
8049261 8051129 Oh, my God!
8051696 8053265 Sir!
8056401 8059538 Are you... are you all right, sir?
8059671 8063575 - Oh, yeah, I'm OK.<br />- You look terrible, sir. What happened?
8063708 8067646 - Oh, nothing. It's no problem.<br />- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
8067779 8071716 - You look awful. You need assistance.<br />- I'm fine.
8071850 8074553 Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
8076555 8078723 Ow! Stop it!
8078857 8081760 - Let her go.<br />- Christ Almighty!
8082594 8083862 You!
8084563 8086531 Hi, Marla.
8087232 8090202 Leave her with me.<br />I'll meet you downstairs.
8090335 8093572 - Are you sure?<br />- Yes, I'm sure.
8095140 8099311 You fucker! What sick fucking game<br />are you playing at, putting me on a...?
8099444 8101546 Oh, my God, your face!
8101680 8103281 Yeah, I know.
8108620 8111156 - What happened?<br />- Don't ask.
8111289 8113291 - You're shot.<br />- Yes, I'm shot.
8113425 8115160 Oh, my God.
8115293 8118296 - I can't believe he's standing.<br />- Tough motherfucker.
8122634 8124603 Who did this?
8124736 8126838 I did, actually.
8127172 8129207 Find some gauze.
8129875 8134679 - You shot yourself?<br />- Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.
8134813 8137182 I'm really OK.
8137782 8141253 Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
8153865 8157836 You met me<br />at a very strange time in my life.
