129215 130825 Cassie, can I have some coffee?
130825 131913 Okay.
135265 137571 You heard about this broad<br />out in Weasley?
137571 141749 Oh, old-school,<br />newspaper, I like it.
141749 144404 Yeah... You know, the news<br />does come on your phone now,
144404 145797 it's a new thing.
145797 147886 Says the man<br />with ten thousand books.
147886 149714 Hmm. Thank you.
149714 152934 Makes her husband breakfast,<br />for 35 years.
152934 156895 One day, she starts putting<br />a little bit of antifreeze
156895 158853 on his orange juice<br />every morning.
158853 160681 Why, was he cold?
162901 165556 What we got here?
165556 169734 Oh... "Empiricism<br />and the Philosophy of Mind".
169734 171736 Bunch of crock.
174173 175914 Wilfrid Sellars wrote this?
175914 179613 Yeah, interesting guy.<br />You know Wilfrid Sellars?
179613 181267 No, but I know Peter Sellars.
181267 183138 Okay...
185967 188622 It took this guy eight months<br />to die from the antifreeze.
189928 191669 That's dedication.
191669 193888 You gotta give her points<br />for tenacity.
193888 196369 Come on. Eight months?
196369 198676 Can you imagine hating<br />anyone that much?
198676 201983 Honestly? I can think<br />of a few candidates, yeah.
201983 203158 How did they catch her?
203158 205291 Mmm... doesn't say.
205291 207859 Maybe they...
207859 209295 Maybe when they tried<br />to embalm the guy,
209295 211297 the formaldehyde wouldn't set.
211297 214300 "I pumped two barrels<br />of that shit into him
214300 215954 and it keeps leaking out."
215954 217825 Put him in the deep freeze<br />and he's still warm.
217825 221307 That's good, that's good.
221307 224223 - Thank you.<br />- Hi there, Cassie.
224223 227182 Cassie, can I get a coffee?
227182 228271 Already got you.
229707 232884 I guess I need it.
236061 237715 You're such a skinny dude.
237715 240195 Where you put all that?
240195 243155 My old man said I have<br />a hollow cock.
243155 245026 Really?
245026 247986 Your father said that,<br />"hollow cock". Interesting.
247986 250075 Yeah, he's a philosopher, too.
256386 259345 I'm going to go<br />right to the airport from here.
259345 261826 I have to go out of town<br />for a couple of days.
261826 263523 - You? What for?<br />- Yeah.
263523 265656 Personal stuff, no big deal.
265656 266874 I'll be back the day<br />after tomorrow.
266874 268746 Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.
269964 271575 - Personal?<br />- Yeah.
271575 273054 Good.
273838 276362 Because if Jericho found out<br />you went out of town on a job...
276362 278277 Give me a little credit,<br />I don't have a death wish.
278277 280018 Then why are you even going?
280018 282281 Like I said, personal.
282281 283891 No big deal.
283891 286546 I'll be back tomorrow.
286546 287982 Okay.<br />Yeah.
299211 300343 Are you okay?
301431 303084 Good.
303084 304347 Okay...
306479 308002 I'm going to get the check.
308002 310309 The check? We just got<br />the plate of food.
310309 312093 I know but I...
312093 313573 don't want to be late,<br />I have to get to the airport.
313573 315575 You got five minutes<br />to eat some food.
315575 317055 Hurry up,<br />take five minutes.
317055 318317 Jesus Christ...
321015 323975 All right, anything<br />comes up, call me.
323975 325498 What the hell?
325498 327326 When did you get the new car?
327326 330111 Oh... Eh... Oh.
333637 336596 So, you're not even going to<br />tell me where you're going now.
336596 338424 I'll tell you when I come back.
345213 346258 Apple.
348826 349870 Dog.
358183 359402 Ehm...
366496 367540 Car.
404055 405099 How are you today?
406318 409234 Well... you tell me.
409234 413499 My initial suspicions<br />were incorrect.
413499 415022 It's not Alzheimer's.
416894 418548 Okay.
418548 420941 What is it?
420941 422377 You're suffering<br />from a condition
422377 424292 known as<br />Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
424292 427644 It presents initially in much<br />the same way as Alzheimer's.
427644 429080 So, what's the difference?
429080 430298 Speed of progression.
433388 437131 I'm guessing...<br />you don't mean it's slower.
439438 441179 In your case,<br />it's incredibly fast.
446924 448316 What's the treatment?
448316 449448 There's no treatment.
452712 456107 The thing you have to<br />remember about dementia
456107 458762 is the thought-feeling<br />connection.
458762 460981 You have a thought,<br />creates a feeling.
460981 464202 You lose a thought,<br />you're left with a feeling.
464202 467292 So, you'll be going along and...
467292 469076 all of a sudden,
469076 471296 you'll be unreasonably happy<br />and you won't know why.
471296 474604 Or you'll have<br />this wave of depression
474604 476606 and you won't know why.
476606 480435 You'll find yourself...<br />forgetting people,
480435 483743 even those you have<br />a connection with.
483743 485702 You'll become displaced<br />in time and space...
495320 496930 Right now, you're mostly lucid
496930 500107 with small patches of confusion<br />and mental lapse.
500107 501848 So, then it'll reverse.
501848 503981 The moments of lucidity<br />will become the exception
503981 505939 and eventually,<br />go away altogether.
505939 508028 How much time do I have?
508028 509377 It's progressing<br />more aggressively
509377 510465 than I would like...
510465 511902 - Uhm...<br />- How much time?
513817 518822 You're looking at weeks,<br />not months.
518822 520563 If you have any arrangements<br />to make,
520563 524175 I suggest you do so<br />as quickly as possible.
524175 526656 Do you have family<br />that can take care of you?
529702 532270 None that would.<br />All right.
532270 536361 Then, I suggest you look<br />into care facilities.
538929 542106 This is a very good place...
542106 543629 in your area.
553552 555467 I'm sorry.
555467 558296 That's okay, doc.
558296 561038 Even if I hated you<br />for telling me,
561038 562779 I'd forget soon enough.
586324 588239 <i>What do you want to know?</i>
588587 590284 <i>I think you have secrets</i>
590284 591982 <i>you don't want to tell me</i>.
591982 594419 Secrets are secrets,<br />so I can't tell you.
597074 599076 I finished<br />the last book you lent me.
599076 601600 Oh, yeah?
601600 604559 What did you think?
604559 607171 I liked it but<br />the end was stupid.
607171 609826 Really?
609826 611392 He just lets them chop off<br />his head
611392 613699 while the other guy walks away?
613699 615570 Well, see...
615570 619705 His whole character arc leads<br />to that moment. You know?
620750 624841 It's a... sacrifice<br />for the greater good, you know?
624841 627887 Mmm...<br />like the end of "Casablanca"?
627887 629802 Yeah, like the end<br />of "Casablanca," exactly.
629802 632326 It was bullshit, too.
632326 634415 Rick would take the girl<br />10 times out of 10.
634415 638158 "A far, far better thing"<br />my ass.
638158 639812 Wow.
639812 642423 Is everyone from Kraków<br />that cynical?
642423 644817 I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.
647515 650083 What day is it?
650083 652607 - Thursday?<br />- No, no, I mean...
652607 654044 I mean what date.
654044 655610 The fifth, does that<br />mean something?
657743 660398 It's my son's birthday,
660398 664619 who hasn't spoken with me<br />many, many years.
668754 671801 Why does he hate you so much?
671801 677110 I'm what the Science journals<br />refer to as a "lousy father."
677110 678938 Mmm...
678938 680940 He found out<br />what I did for a living.
680940 682463 Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
682463 684030 What do you do<br />for a living?
684030 685728 I work for the IRS.
685728 687730 Just like that, I hate you too.
689688 691081 I've been coming here
691081 694258 once a week for almost...<br />four years
694258 697914 and that's the first thing<br />you've said about yourself.
697914 699393 What do you want to know?
699393 701395 I'll tell you anything,<br />just ask me.
701395 703876 Is that your real name,<br />Aristotle?
703876 706357 No, it's a nickname
706357 708185 the guys in my platoon gave me,
708185 709795 I was in the first Gulf War
709795 711188 and I used to read a lot<br />of books,
711188 713581 like philosophy<br />and... like that.
720937 722199 I got to go.
734080 737780 The thing with your son<br />explains a lot, though.
737780 739825 What do you mean?
739825 741044 You know how they say
741044 742959 haunted houses have cold spots?
744569 746266 Stand in certain areas,
746266 749052 and a chill goes down your spine<br />like an artic breeze.
749052 751097 What the hell<br />you're talking about?
751097 752490 That's what's like here.
752490 754361 You walk in the door<br />and you feel it.
754361 756537 Only it isn't a ghost.
756537 757974 What is it?
757974 759845 Loneliness.
761891 764458 See you next Thursday,<br />not really Aristotle.
769333 770377 This guy's<br />a piece of work.
770377 771639 I don't care.
771639 773511 Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>
773511 775034 Why do we always<br />have to go through this?
775034 776819 Why do we have to<br />go through what?
776819 779212 You ask me if I want to know<br />the details of the job
779212 780823 and I say, "no, I really don't"
780823 782737 and then you tell me<br />the details of the job
782737 784174 and then I say, "shut up" and<br />we go through it again and again
784174 785610 and we always go through
785610 786654 the same thing<br />every fucking time!
786654 787873 The question is,
787873 789309 why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
789309 790528 Ready.
794967 798579 Hey, this could be<br />my last job for a while.
798579 800973 What the fuck is going on, John?
800973 802932 Nothing, I just need to<br />take care of a few things
802932 804455 I'll clear it with Jericho.
804455 806239 Okay, how long are you<br />going to be out?
807632 808676 Hard to say.
809677 811897 Come on. Let's go.
811897 813072 This motherfucker sells<br />men for human labor,
813072 814247 that's a thing now.
814247 815814 Jesus Christ.
815814 816989 I thought trafficking<br />was like sex shit.
816989 818512 Same thing every time.
818512 819774 Didn't we just go<br />through this at the car?
822212 825215 Why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
825215 826607 Because in ten minutes,
826607 829959 Tommy, he's not going to<br />be anybody.
829959 831264 Let's go get this done.
930059 931538 Damn it.
995907 997039 Hello?
998823 999867 Yeah.
1001043 1003219 Well, we were...
1003219 1005569 expecting only one person<br />to be there.
1006570 1007701 We got split up.
1009225 1010791 I guess he figured...
1010791 1012663 I don't know,<br />we could cover more ground.
1014230 1017059 And I heard shots...
1021498 1022542 Christ, Tommy.
1026285 1027634 I didn't mean to.
1031290 1034076 - Knox...<br />- I'm sorry, Tommy.
1043781 1044825 Yeah, he was.
1047132 1050875 <i>Yeah. I made sure the scene<br />was clean and then I left.</i>
1057229 1058274 Okay.
1059405 1060450 Thank you.
1078032 1079991 You're buying this?
1079991 1082080 Five bullets, three victims?
1082080 1084778 Had to happen fast.
1084778 1086911 Are you thinking<br />there's a third shooter?
1086911 1088434 There's no evidence of that.
1091481 1093700 Growing up, I hated my mother.
1093700 1095789 Is that right?
1095789 1097835 She was a stereotype,<br />overbearing,
1097835 1100098 Asian, hellicopter mom.
1100098 1102187 An "A" minus meant<br />I didn't have any pride.
1102187 1103928 My mother was a drunk, so...
1103928 1105582 - This is about me.<br />- Sorry.
1105582 1108498 She hates my chosen profession<br />but, ironically,
1108498 1111892 made me a good detective.
1111892 1113285 Realizing her wanting me
1113285 1114895 to excel was about her<br />and not me,
1116288 1118421 gave me my first lesson<br />in motive.
1118421 1121032 She taught me that the details<br />were important.
1121032 1122425 The answers lie
1122425 1123861 in the little things<br />other people,
1123861 1125906 she meant white people, overlook.
1125906 1128431 With all due respect,<br />is this going somewhere?
1128431 1130302 There's water<br />all over the floor.
1130302 1133175 That means the shower was on<br />when the curtain came down.
1133175 1135264 Okay.
1135264 1137701 - So?<br />- So,
1137701 1139398 he killed them, they killed him,
1139398 1141226 all in a hurry,<br />bang, bang, bang.
1143097 1144273 Who turned off the shower?
1185836 1188273 - Hey, Knox.<br />- Hey.
1188273 1189970 Sit down. Want a drink?
1189970 1193278 Yeah. Yeah, whisky.
1193278 1196063 So...
1196063 1199284 you just swing by to say hello?
1199284 1201243 No, closing out.
1201243 1203680 I have to do it<br />pretty quick, too.
1203680 1205377 - Quick?<br />- Yeah.
1205377 1207249 - Jericho knows?<br />- He can't.
1208250 1210426 That makes it tough.
1210426 1211775 Raise your commission, I guess.
1213907 1218129 I'm uh... I'm going away.
1218129 1220218 For good this time.
1220218 1222829 And I don't want this<br />blowing back on Jericho.
1222829 1224091 What happened?
1224091 1225832 A job went South.
1225832 1229575 I set the scene out to buy<br />myself some time but...
1229575 1232578 - It's not going to last long.<br />- I'm sure about that.
1232578 1234624 Three people,
1234624 1236278 all shot each other<br />with the same gun.
1237540 1238845 Yeah, that's not good.
1240369 1242327 My gun.
1242327 1243676 - That's worse.<br />- Yeah.
1244764 1247680 So time is of the essence.<br />How do you have your capital.
1247680 1249378 Mostly cash.
1249378 1252119 Got some paintings<br />you got to sell. Some stones.
1252119 1254731 - That's simple enough.<br />- Yeah.
1258909 1260345 A list of three people.
1260345 1262478 All three, equal shares.
1262478 1265089 Nothing in here<br />for Muncie's family?
1265089 1266569 Muncie didn't have anybody.
1268658 1271965 I can't have any of this<br />touch those people.
1271965 1273619 This money has to be clean.
1276579 1280104 Gather your assets,<br />I'll set it up.
1280104 1281453 A couple of days.
1281453 1283150 Hey, this stays<br />between you and me.
1283150 1287111 Yeah, and I'm going to tell who?
1287111 1289026 All right.
1289026 1290288 All right, thanks.
1318403 1319839 What's up?
1319839 1321580 This key doesn't work<br />on the... uh...
1323277 1325541 - The thing, the...<br />- Lock?
1325541 1327847 - Lock, yeah.<br />- All right.
1327847 1329501 Yeah, the green ones,
1329501 1330633 they go to our other facility,<br />out in Van Nuys.
1330633 1331721 Okay.
1333636 1335246 Hey, could you do me a favor?
1335246 1338075 Could you... uh... write down<br />the number...
1338075 1339642 - The address?<br />- The address.
1339642 1340904 Yeah, got you.
1390780 1392477 Sorry, I didn't mean to...
1392477 1395219 just to show up like this,<br />I should've called.
1395219 1398744 I didn't mean to ambush you,<br />I'm sorry.
1398744 1400180 Do I know you?
1403183 1406273 Okay, I guess I deserve that.
1406273 1410321 You got to know I wouldn't<br />be here unless I was desperate.
1410321 1412628 Okay? I need your help.
1415369 1418329 Dad, could you please<br />just talk to me?
1418329 1419417 Dad.
1420723 1422464 Miles... yeah.
1424291 1427860 Sure, Miles.<br />Come here. Come on in.
1427860 1432125 Thank you, I just...
1432125 1435259 Have a seat.
1444224 1448490 No, no, no, I'm... I'm sober.<br />Nine years.
1455627 1457977 That's your blood?
1457977 1461981 Yeah, my hand is... Uhm...
1461981 1465202 I cut it in a...
1465202 1467900 This is my blood<br />and that's someone else's.
1467900 1469641 Holy fuck!
1475517 1476692 I fucked up.
1478781 1481305 I fucked up really bad.
1481305 1483699 Okay... okay.
1483699 1487093 Okay, take it easy.
1487093 1488965 Catch your breath.
1488965 1490967 Tell me what happened.
1494536 1496146 I killed someone.
1498104 1499541 Did they deserve killing?
1503632 1505808 Okay, start there.
1507549 1509899 Okay.
1509899 1513163 You have<br />a granddaughter.
1513163 1516819 - Kaylee.<br />- How did you know about her?
1516819 1519256 Your mother told me,<br />right after she was born.
1521214 1523739 Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.
1523739 1526959 What is she, like 12? 13?
1526959 1528961 She's 16.
1528961 1530572 Here...
1535751 1538275 - Cute kid.<br />- Yeah.
1538275 1539363 She's a kid.
1542409 1543889 And she met this guy...
1545543 1547284 Online. This...
1547284 1549895 piece of shit!
1549895 1551897 The guy was 32 years old.
1551897 1556423 This son of a bitch<br />gets her pregnant.
1556423 1559122 She's 16 years old,<br />she's my little girl.
1559122 1563169 So, I go over<br />to his house, you know?
1563169 1566259 I was just going to put<br />the fear of God on him.
1566259 1570089 And I show up and he's...
1570089 1572483 more than I expected. Okay?
1575573 1578402 He wouldn't shut up.<br />Just kept talking,
1578402 1581100 and talking and talking<br />about my fucking daughter.
1581100 1583276 Like, saying shit<br />about her, like...
1583276 1585191 "she loves it,"<br />"She wanted more."
1585191 1589413 Called her "ripe."<br />Called her ripe, dad!
1589413 1593373 Fuck! I just lost it.
1593373 1596463 So I grabbed a knife<br />and I sho...
1596463 1598552 I shoved it into his neck.
1601686 1604210 And I stabbed him.
1604210 1607170 I just... couldn't stop.
1609389 1610608 I didn't care.
1612175 1614177 Because I wasn't even<br />in the room, I was...
1622751 1623882 Did you bury this guy?
1625014 1626363 Did I bury him?
1626363 1628191 Yeah.
1628191 1630584 No, why?
1630584 1632282 Because if you did, I was<br />going to dig him up
1632282 1633457 and kill him again.
1639768 1641291 Oh, my God...
1642901 1644120 So, why did you come to me?
1648167 1650387 Are you kidding?
1651910 1654434 Well, I mean...
1654434 1656654 You're the only person<br />I know that can... I...
1656654 1658700 This isn't my world.
1658700 1663052 - I don't know how to...<br />- Get rid of a body.
1663052 1666925 I never asked you<br />for anything in my life.
1666925 1671887 Okay? And I'm here because<br />I had nowhere else to go.
1671887 1673976 Now you need me.
1673976 1676413 Yeah, that's what<br />this is, I'm desperate.
1676413 1679721 Okay? I'm so fucking desperate<br />that I'm here, at your house,
1679721 1681244 asking you for help.
1681244 1682549 Now, are you<br />going to help me or not?
1693299 1694779 Where's the murder weapon?
1720892 1722502 Here.
1722502 1724374 Put your clothes<br />in that plastic bag,
1724374 1726768 then take a shower<br />and scrub down everything.
1726768 1728987 Underneath the fingernails,<br />clean everything.
1728987 1730815 Then, afterwards,<br />I'm going to wrap and clean
1730815 1732382 that hand of yours.
1732382 1734645 - Then what?<br />- Then?
1734645 1736081 You go home to your wife
1736081 1739737 and you never<br />mention this again.
1739737 1741913 My whole life, I never<br />asked you for anything.
1741913 1745221 Yeah, you said that already.
1745221 1749791 Here, use that. I'm going to<br />need those boxers, too.
1754143 1756928 Hey, where's the body?
1829174 1831611 Write it down. Write it down.
2056314 2057620 There you are.
2060405 2061667 What are you doing?
2063147 2064148 Nothing.
2067804 2069588 I talked to her.
2071155 2072374 What did she say?
2074854 2077074 She wants you to take her.
2077074 2078119 What?
2079511 2081557 Well, I assumed this would be...
2081557 2084168 you know, like,<br />a mother-daughter thing.
2084168 2086692 Well, apparently it isn't.
2088303 2089956 What happened to your hand?
2099444 2100793 I have to tell you something.
2110586 2111978 All right, what do we got?
2111978 2114459 Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.
2114459 2116113 We're waiting<br />for the Interpol jacket
2116113 2118942 but safe to say he wasn't<br />a model citizen.
2118942 2121379 The woman was local,<br />Annette Elmora.
2121379 2122859 Yeah, we're thinking<br />maybe he picked her up
2122859 2124426 at a club or something.
2124426 2126776 You know, wrong place-wrong time<br />kind of thing.
2126776 2128952 Victim number three is<br />where it gets interesting.
2128952 2130345 Meet Thomas Muncie,
2130345 2132042 suspected hitter for Jericho.
2132042 2134392 Conspicuously missing<br />from the carnage,
2134392 2136873 this man, John Knox.
2136873 2138875 Traffic cam shot this<br />six blocks away
2138875 2140268 around the time of death.
2140268 2142444 Facial recognition flagged him.
2142444 2143662 That could just be<br />a driver, though.
2143662 2145011 We're sure this guy's a driver?
2145011 2147188 What's his jacket say?
2147188 2149538 Not much. He did a six-year<br />stretch for tax evasion
2149538 2151757 and that's only because<br />someone ratted them out.
2151757 2153716 Other than that<br />and his service record,
2153716 2155457 there's nothing on him.
2155457 2157023 Which means, whatever<br />this guy does for a living,
2157023 2158155 he's pretty good at it.
2158155 2159548 Smart, too.
2159548 2161376 According to the tax<br />auditor's notes,
2161376 2163421 John Knox holds two PhDs.
2163421 2166555 One in English Lit<br />and one in US History.
2166555 2168818 Even taught in Bucknell<br />a couple of years.
2168818 2171516 And we're thinking this guy<br />kills people for a living?
2171516 2173170 Why?
2173170 2175520 Hopefully, we'll get<br />to ask him ourselves.
2175520 2177261 What branch of service<br />was he in?
2177261 2180569 Army. He was a deep<br />reconnaissance officer.
2180569 2183006 Remind me what that is again?
2183006 2184486 Someone who goes off alone
2184486 2186444 behind enemy lines<br />for weeks at a time.
2186444 2188054 Then, maybe we just<br />bring him in
2188054 2189491 as a cooperating witness.
2189491 2191754 Friend-of-the-victim<br />kind of thing.
2191754 2193973 He might slip up<br />and give us something.
2193973 2195888 Does he seem like someone<br />who makes mistakes?
2195888 2199240 Hey, boss, check your texts.
2202678 2204245 Another body.
2204245 2205942 And now, we got three<br />on my board already.
2205942 2208031 Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.
2208031 2210381 That's your métier.
2210381 2212296 Métier? Really?
2220696 2222437 - John Knox.<br />- Hey!
2222437 2224308 - Hi.<br />- Is he upstairs?
2224308 2226049 Yeah. I'm supposed to think<br />he's doing the books.
2226049 2228443 - What's he really doing?<br />- Watching TV.
2228443 2230662 - I married a little boy.<br />- Yeah.
2230662 2232577 Well, he married up,<br />that's for sure.
2237800 2240368 Xavier! Coming up.
2252684 2255252 Look at this skinny<br />son of a bitch.
2255252 2259387 They rescued him<br />from a big cat sanctuary.
2259387 2262303 Locals toss him stray dogs<br />in a cave
2262303 2264348 so he can have something to eat.
2264348 2266481 Kind of reminds me of you.
2266481 2268744 You know, when I first found you<br />after your war.
2270702 2271964 I never ate a dog.
2273966 2276795 What's this,<br />grocery list?
2276795 2279320 It's a plan,<br />and I'm going to need your help.
2279320 2280451 Just read it.
2284368 2285935 Hey, Ludmilla looks good.
2287371 2290766 She still hasn't realized
2290766 2293246 what a mistake she made<br />marrying me.
2293246 2295466 You're learning any Russian?
2295466 2298904 Just the stuff she says<br />I need to know.
2298904 2301472 "Yes, dear." "Please."
2301472 2302778 All the essentials.
2306434 2308392 Okay, lay it on me.
2310176 2311961 Stabbed at least 17 times.
2314006 2315443 I put time of death between
2315443 2316879 3:00 and 8:00 p.m.<br />yesterday afternoon.
2316879 2318184 I'll get a more precise<br />time frame
2318184 2319403 when I get him to the shop.
2319403 2321579 - All right.<br />- Yeah.
2321579 2323799 Thanks, bro.
2323799 2326018 There's no murder weapon yet,
2326018 2328543 but there's a knife missing<br />from that kitchen block.
2328543 2331110 I mean, it doesn't even look<br />like anything was stolen.
2331110 2332677 He's got an expensive watch<br />on his wrist,
2332677 2335158 he's got a wallet<br />full of large bills...
2335158 2336768 I know this racist<br />piece of crap.
2336768 2339118 His name is Andrew Palmer.
2339118 2340729 He moves cash around
2340729 2342513 for the Aryan Brotherhood<br />but... he's a cog.
2342513 2345168 - Not a shot caller.<br />- So, he winds up dead.
2345168 2347431 There's no big mystery there.
2347431 2349346 But he also did a stretch<br />a few years back
2349346 2350956 for kiddie porn.
2350956 2353742 And this... this doesn't look<br />like business.
2353742 2356005 This looks personal.
2356005 2357354 Detective, gate guard out<br />front says
2357354 2358573 he was knocked out<br />last night.
2359878 2360923 I got this.
2363055 2366145 Bag the victim's computers,<br />any flash drives and discs.
2366145 2368452 - What are we looking for?<br />- You'll know when you see it.
2368452 2370236 Oh, and see if you can find<br />his phone,
2370236 2371412 he didn't have it on him.
2371412 2372456 Got it.
2379115 2381117 So, how long have you known?
2381117 2382945 Uh... not long.
2384425 2386818 Doc says this thing<br />moves pretty fast.
2386818 2389212 Oh, Jesus, Knox.
2389212 2392215 I can't think of anything worse.
2392215 2394173 Except maybe your pecker<br />stops working.
2394173 2400397 Actually, I'm looking forward<br />to forgetting some things.
2400397 2405489 Muncie... Christ.<br />I can't imagine what the--
2405489 2407360 That's like me shooting you.
2407360 2409754 I don't even remember<br />doing it. I mean, I know...
2409754 2413149 I know I did it but I have<br />no recollection of the event.
2413149 2415064 Well, count your blessings.
2416457 2417806 This is a radical plan.
2417806 2420852 It's the only way<br />I can figure it.
2420852 2424769 This kid's DNA is<br />all over the place.
2424769 2426292 He actually bled on the guy,
2426292 2428338 he's got his fingerprints<br />everywhere.
2428338 2431123 He might as well just<br />signed off on the job.
2431123 2433125 Still, if you don't<br />pull this off,
2433125 2437390 you're both fucked.<br />Yeah.
2437390 2439871 - I'm fucked either way.<br />- That's true.
2439871 2442483 That's why I'm asking you<br />to help me.
2442483 2444572 Look, just check in with me.
2444572 2447966 Just check in with me<br />now and then. You know?
2447966 2450969 - Make sure I'm on point.<br />- Yeah, of course, sure.
2450969 2456279 Just so you don't ever thing<br />this stupid plan is my idea.
2456279 2457933 I'm sure you'll remind me.
2460326 2462024 You want to know<br />the funny thing?
2462024 2464548 Let's say I pull this thing off,
2464548 2466898 I won't even know<br />if I did it or not.
2466898 2469248 It's encouraging.
2469248 2471990 This plan is<br />precision work, man.
2471990 2473862 - One hair out of place--<br />- Oh, I know.
2475559 2477605 I know.
2477605 2479911 I know I could pull this off.
2479911 2481217 The question is, can you?
2482653 2485569 So, you didn't see his face,<br />didn't see his height, nothing?
2485569 2486657 - No.<br />- Okay.
2486657 2487963 All right, thank you.
2491183 2492402 Beautiful day.
2492402 2494099 Sure.
2494099 2495536 What did you get?
2495536 2496624 Don't suppose he can<br />ID our killer.
2496624 2498190 No, he was attacked from behind.
2498190 2499757 He didn't see anything.
2499757 2501846 Happened a little before<br />three in the morning.
2501846 2503239 Doesn't fit the timeline.
2503239 2505676 M.E. said he was killed<br />before 8:00 p.m.
2505676 2508026 So you think the attack<br />on the guard is unrelated?
2508026 2510638 It's related, I'm just...<br />not sure how, yet.
2510638 2512944 They get anything off<br />these security cameras?
2512944 2514555 Well, that part is weird.
2514555 2516731 They feed into a DVR<br />in the utility closet.
2516731 2519342 - There's no hard drive.<br />- You mean it doesn't work?
2519342 2521649 No, I mean the tech<br />couldn't get playback
2521649 2522824 so we opened up the DVR<br />and looked inside,
2522824 2524216 no hard drive.
2524216 2525478 Found his phone.
2525478 2527263 Can't open it, though.
2527263 2528830 It's got one of those facial<br />recognition locks on it.
2528830 2532224 - Okay, head back inside.<br />- Okay.
2532224 2533748 What am I looking for?
2533748 2535880 His face. I assume<br />that's where it is...
2537099 2538143 Right.
2596549 2597681 Did you forget I was coming?
2598900 2600597 Oh... no, no.
2609214 2610259 How are you?
2613610 2616308 Good. I'm...
2616308 2618223 kind of knotted up.
2618223 2619485 That's why I'm here.
2622793 2625230 I finished the book.
2625230 2628712 It was... better but I knew<br />he was going to die in the end.
2628712 2630583 He kind of had to.
2630583 2632673 I'll find you another one here.
2636241 2637373 This is your ex?
2639854 2641899 Yeah.
2641899 2645511 - Well, she's gorgeous.<br />- Yeah.
2645511 2648471 Hey...
2648471 2653258 put that down--
2653258 2654695 Why don't I get ready?
2660483 2661614 Fuck me.
2681547 2685290 - These paintings are all real?<br />- Yeah.
2685290 2689033 - It's safer than cash.<br />- Are they worth a lot?
2689033 2692907 - Why do you have them?<br />- Part of my cashing-out process.
2692907 2694169 What?
2697302 2701176 - What do you mean "cashing out"?<br />- Forget I said it. Forget it.
2702655 2704396 Did you find me something?
2708226 2711447 Hello? You picked me<br />another book?
2713101 2714667 You want a book?
2714667 2718976 Knox, are you having<br />a stroke or something?
2718976 2721805 - Maybe you should sit down?<br />- You know what? Maybe...
2723938 2725330 Maybe it's better<br />if you just go.
2727898 2729378 Good idea.
2759712 2761758 Sorry.
2761758 2765588 I just got a...<br />Got a thing I got to do.
2765588 2768765 - Same time next week?<br />- Yeah.
2770245 2771855 Yeah, you bet, next week.
2771855 2773770 Are you sure you're<br />going to be okay?
2773770 2774858 Never better.
2811808 2813375 Here.
2814855 2816334 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
2816334 2819511 We have an appointment.<br />Last name's Knox.
2819511 2821774 Okay. All right, here it is.
2821774 2823907 You must be Kaylee. And you are?
2823907 2826779 I'm the father...<br />Her father, not the...
2826779 2828999 - I'm her dad.<br />- Okay, dad.
2828999 2832263 See, sign here.<br />Initial here, here and here.
2832263 2833830 Before we do the procedure,
2833830 2835876 the law says we have to<br />ask you a few questions.
2835876 2837225 Not about the father<br />of the child
2837225 2838966 or anything like that,
2838966 2841055 just to make sure<br />that <i>you</i> want to be here.
2841055 2842883 That'd be okay?
2842883 2844667 I guess so.
2844667 2845755 Good.
2846843 2849324 Now it's your turn.
2849324 2850934 I need a couple of signatures<br />from you,
2850934 2853154 starting here on the consent<br />form.
2860117 2861379 All right,<br />guys, have a sit.
2861379 2862511 Thank you.
2870040 2871476 <i>Are you having</i>
2871476 2873261 <i>a stroke of something?</i>
2885621 2886970 Xavier, hey.
2886970 2889407 I'm calling to make sure<br />you're on track.
2889407 2893977 - On track with what?<br />- Your cockamamie plan is what.
2893977 2896371 You got your notepad?
2896371 2897894 Yeah.
2899635 2901680 Yeah, I'm on track,<br />don't worry about it.
2901680 2902943 He says "don't worry."
2904031 2907251 Do me a favor,<br />unlock your phone.
2907251 2909775 <i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>
2909775 2912996 - <i>Okay?</i><br />- Why?
2912996 2917348 Well, what if you need help<br />and you can't remember the code.
2917348 2920438 Right... right, okay.
2920438 2922049 Yeah, got it.
2926749 2930971 - You're there?<br />- Huh? Yeah.
2930971 2933234 I feel like I'm getting worse<br />every hour.
2936933 2938413 I'm running out of time.
2938413 2942678 So, stop wasting it<br />talking to me. Okay?
3018797 3021104 What?<br />I'm in the middle of dinner.
3022323 3024281 It's not even 4:30.
3024281 3025761 Oh, I'm almost 90.
3025761 3027545 Dinner time is<br />very important to me.
3027545 3029373 What's up?
3029373 3031810 <i>Yeah, I'm looking at<br />some kind of locker key.</i>
3031810 3034074 <i>Do you know where that's from?</i>
3034074 3035597 <i>You never confided</i>
3035597 3036685 <i>in me where you keep<br />all your money.</i>
3036685 3039644 I'm a crook, you know?
3039644 3041951 All right. Great, thanks,<br />I'll figure it out.
3041951 3043518 Hey, wait a minute.
3043518 3045259 Did you take the passcode<br />off your phone?
3045259 3047870 Ehm... yeah, I'm going to<br />do that now.
3047870 3049828 I'll do it right now. Okay?
3049828 3052831 Thanks. Say hi to Becky from me.
3052831 3056313 - Wait, who?<br />- <i>Becky.</i>
3056313 3058794 Ehm... okay.
3058794 3061231 - All right.<br />- How's he doing?
3061231 3064582 - He just called you Becky.<br />- Who's this Becky?
3064582 3066323 She was one of my wives.
3066323 3069500 I divorced her before<br />you were born, baby.
3069500 3072851 This business with Knox...<br />It's not good.
3072851 3075071 No.
3075071 3076246 It's not.
3127645 3128690 Shit.
3188053 3190752 I ordered some food,<br />this place has great ribs.
3190752 3195104 I'm a vegan. Should we...?
3195104 3196932 Should we be meeting<br />in public like this?
3196932 3198238 No one knows us here.
3200501 3203765 - How's the hand?<br />- Well, it...
3203765 3206507 - hurts.<br />- If anyone asks you about it,
3206507 3208117 you cut on broken glass.
3208117 3209988 You were at my house,<br />we were having a drink.
3209988 3212948 What? Why would I be<br />at your place?
3212948 3214123 You were looking for<br />your old Hot Wheels,
3214123 3215559 make something up.
3219824 3221348 - How are you doing?<br />- How am I doing?
3221348 3223001 Yeah, uhm...
3224351 3227005 Spent the day<br />at the abortion clinic with...
3227005 3230705 my 16-year-old daughter<br />so, bad, I guess.
3230705 3232707 Pretty bad.
3232707 3236101 Not sleeping, not eating.<br />I haven't eaten since yesterday.
3236101 3237538 Uhm...
3237538 3239409 My hair is falling out.
3239409 3242064 So, I'm about to lose<br />my goddamn mind.
3242064 3245067 Okay, okay.<br />You need to get a grip.
3245067 3246895 I don't know how<br />to do this, I'm not...
3246895 3248418 I'm not like you, you know?
3250115 3251421 I'm not a killer.
3256426 3258515 You are, though.
3258515 3260822 What?
3260822 3263738 A killer.
3263738 3267002 Damn good one, too.<br />Not half-assed.
3267002 3270397 I was out at the scene.<br />Let me put it to you this way:
3272486 3276794 that wasn't what you call<br />a proportional response.
3276794 3279406 - I lost it.<br />- Understandable.
3279406 3282713 But now I need you<br />to pull it all together, okay?
3282713 3284367 You're like<br />a walking confession.
3284367 3285542 I'll try harder.
3285542 3288153 No, do the opposite. Relax.
3289938 3290982 Okay.
3300644 3301732 Is she your only kid?
3304953 3311002 We... we lost one early on,<br />a miscarriage.
3311699 3314005 - Sorry, it's tough.<br />- Yeah.
3316268 3318488 More on Cheryl, actually.
3318488 3321099 What does she do, Cheryl?
3321099 3323406 Teaches fourth grade,
3323406 3325365 public school.
3325365 3329281 Yeah and... kids love her.
3329281 3331936 All right.<br />Boy, you guys are busy.
3331936 3334635 Working parents,<br />on the go all the time.
3334635 3337725 What's the typical day?
3337725 3341206 Tomorrow for instance,<br />what would you do tomorrow?
3341206 3343818 Go get breakfast somewhere
3343818 3345602 and walk around<br />Largemouth Village
3345602 3348126 and then Kaylee has<br />soccer and...
3348126 3351129 - You now.<br />- Do that. Do that.
3351129 3353131 - Just do that.<br />- Do that?
3353131 3356700 Yeah.<br />- We can't, she's laid up in bed.
3356700 3359790 Don't vary your routine,<br />do what you would normally do.
3380028 3381682 What happened to vegan?
3381682 3383597 Fuck it, I'm starving.
3383597 3386469 I've been starving<br />for six years.
3386469 3390821 You ever take the family<br />up to the cabin?
3390821 3393998 - The hunting cabin?<br />- Yeah.
3393998 3395478 I sold it, remember?
3395478 3397524 You signed the papers<br />two years ago.
3399961 3401310 These are so fucking good.
3402137 3404444 Yeah.
3404444 3405923 I remember that.<br />You know anything about the...
3406968 3408839 about if the owners...<br />I mean, if they use it...
3408839 3410493 full time or...
3410493 3411538 part time?
3411538 3413061 - The buyers?<br />- Yeah.
3415193 3417152 Well, I'm not renting it<br />to them. They...
3417152 3418675 I sold it to them.
3418675 3420677 They bought it, they own it.<br />I have no...
3420677 3422462 - Right.<br />- Why would I know what they do?
3422462 3423985 Okay, listen to me.
3426248 3427423 You just need to...
3428598 3429947 hold it together, okay?
3429947 3432602 We're almost there,<br />couple of days.
3432602 3433690 Okay.
3435431 3436476 Look at me.
3440392 3442307 I need you to use my balls.
3443570 3445049 What?
3445049 3447704 They're gonna connect Kaylee<br />to the dead guy.
3447704 3449576 Then they're gonna question you.
3449576 3451969 If you don't think you have<br />the balls for it, use mine.
3451969 3454972 Do whatever you think I would do<br />if I was on that chair.
3456234 3457671 All right?
3457671 3458759 What?
3466201 3467724 I never hated you, you know?
3469683 3470771 Well...
3473295 3475166 Be understandable if you did.
3475166 3476690 You were a good dad in your way.
3478387 3479736 I remember a lot of good.
3481912 3484828 I remember ball games.<br />I remember you teaching me...
3484828 3485916 how to hunt.
3487744 3490094 I remember you letting me<br />eat pancakes in the pool.
3493663 3496492 I worshiped you.
3496492 3497972 I wanted to be just like you.
3501192 3502846 Then, you know, I found out.
3505501 3506546 And I thought...
3510854 3512029 What if I did?
3517339 3519471 Did what?
3519471 3521082 What if I wound up<br />just like you?
3526740 3527784 And here we are.
3532659 3533747 Yeah, here we are.
3575092 3577965 All right... Gelfuso, you're up.
3577965 3581446 Okay. Scene was<br />definitely staged.
3581446 3583100 Ballistics says<br />all three victims
3583100 3584754 killed with the same gun.
3584754 3587017 Uh, didn't see that coming.<br />That's a fun one.
3587017 3588584 They find the gun?<br />Yeah.
3588584 3590978 It was the one<br />in shower guy's hand.
3590978 3592762 Five shots total.
3592762 3595547 Only prints on the gun belong<br />to the dead Spaniard.
3596200 3598507 Anybody holding out<br />for a triple murder-suicide?
3598507 3600074 That would be a neat trick.
3600074 3601728 Specially the part<br />where he reaches out
3601728 3603730 and turns off the shower<br />after he's already dead.
3603730 3604948 Nice catch.<br />Thank you.
3607342 3608952 What else?
3608952 3610171 I scoured<br />every surveillance camera
3610171 3611781 in the area.
3611781 3613304 I can't put anyone<br />in the house with Muncie.
3613304 3615263 Least of all is<br />John Knox's character.
3615263 3616830 We know Knox's movements?
3616830 3618179 He hasn't used
3618179 3619659 his credit card<br />since the murder.
3619659 3621356 Two days before them,
3621356 3624011 he flies from Burbank to<br />San Francisco for 22 hours.
3624011 3625708 Why?
3625708 3627667 That part,<br />I haven't figured out yet.
3627667 3629320 But I got him on the return<br />flight then he goes dark.
3629320 3632323 I think it's time we had a chat<br />with John Knox.
3632323 3634717 Go pick him up,<br />but bring him in voluntarily.
3634717 3636501 We got nothing<br />to hold him as a suspect.
3636501 3637677 All right.
3798272 3800709 Do you know what electives<br />you're gonna take this year?
3801753 3803930 Did you get your syllabus?
3803930 3806802 Yeah, I actually ended up<br />getting a class with Michelles.
3806802 3807890 Mhm!
3810980 3812373 I got<br />a pick-up order for Anthony.
3821991 3824472 I-I just think that it might be<br />too much this year.
3824472 3826561 Thanks.<br />- Very good.
3826561 3827997 I'm still gonna do soccer.<br />I think...
3827997 3829607 Hey, excuse me.<br />Yeah.
3829607 3830695 I saw you<br />looking at my daughter.
3830695 3832001 Do I know you?
3832001 3833481 No.<br />Hey! Oh, my God!
3833481 3834699 Fuck you!
3850150 3851716 John Knox?
3851716 3853805 Johnny Law.
3853805 3856939 We got something going on<br />we'd like to get your help with.
3856939 3859637 If you could come with us.<br />Voluntarily.
3859637 3860856 Sure.
3860856 3862466 Why not? It's my day off.
3862466 3864599 I'll grab a jacket<br />and I'll follow you down.
3864599 3866514 Or we could follow you down.
3867907 3869212 Better.
3874130 3877568 She's on my policy. I told you,<br />and I told the last person.
3878961 3880789 It was pre-approved.
3880789 3882573 Her doctor faxed it in.
3882573 3884967 You know, we go<br />through the same fuck...
3884967 3887013 damn thing every month.
3887013 3888710 D-don't put me on hold.
3894629 3896544 We got Knox set up<br />in Interview Two.
3899503 3901679 Anything on the other case?<br />Homer?
3901679 3905031 the prints we found don't<br />match anything on the system.
3905031 3906423 The ME confirmed<br />that there were
3906423 3908121 two blood types<br />on the scene,
3908121 3909470 but hadn't had time to run<br />DNA sequencing to look
3909470 3911341 for a match on the second guy.
3916520 3917826 It's always "guys" with you.
3919654 3922222 - Eh?<br />- You said "the second guy."
3922222 3923832 You also said the gate card
3923832 3926052 was grabbed from behind<br />by "the guy,"
3926052 3927749 even though he never saw<br />his attacker.
3927749 3929533 It's always "guys" with you.
3929533 3932667 Fine. The ME has not had time<br />to run DNA sequencing
3932667 3935496 to look for a match on the<br />second them, they or their.
3935496 3937759 - Is that better?<br />- Welcome to the 21st century.
3937759 3939195 Oh, my God.
3950467 3952382 Detective. How can I help you?
3953470 3955168 Save it for the tape.
3957039 3959041 Detective Emily Ikari,
3959041 3962262 interviewing potential<br />material witness, John Knox.
3962262 3965134 Case number 52698.
3966309 3970096 Interview is voluntary.<br />Commencing at 10:46 a.m.
3971227 3973229 Ah... please state your name<br />for the record.
3974056 3975405 John Knox.
3975405 3977277 Ah, full legal.<br />Need the middle name.
3985676 3986982 It's not a trick question.
3986982 3988679 Those come later.
3989593 3990855 John Henry Knox.
3994555 3996339 Okay. I don't know<br />what game this is,
3996339 3997514 but let's move on.
3999473 4002476 You said something about...
4002476 4004260 me being a witness?
4004260 4007568 I hope so. I'm working<br />on the death of your partner.
4007568 4010571 - I don't have a partner.<br />- Not anymore.
4010571 4012442 If you're referring<br />to Thomas Muncie,
4012442 4013704 he was an acquaintance.
4013704 4015489 We never did any work together.
4015489 4018927 I've been over the crime scene<br />a dozen times. Ah...
4018927 4020407 let me tell you<br />what I think happened.
4020407 4021495 Sure.
4022409 4024846 There were three dead bodies<br />in that room,
4024846 4026500 all shot with the same gun,
4026500 4028371 and staged to look<br />like they killed each other.
4029546 4032071 But... it was clumsy.
4032071 4035335 Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.
4035335 4039121 I think someone<br />killed Muncie by mistake
4039121 4040992 and tried to stage it<br />to cover it up.
4044561 4047390 Did you say Ikari?
4047390 4049958 Are you related to Peter Ikari?
4052482 4054484 That's my father.<br />Oh, hell.
4055572 4057139 I know Pete.
4057139 4058749 Get him in here.<br />I'll talk to him.
4058749 4060229 You know my father?
4061230 4064190 I just talked to him...<br />couple days ago.
4064190 4066061 He used to patrol<br />my neighborhood.
4067367 4069020 Mr. Knox, my father is dead.
4070979 4072023 What?
4074722 4076158 What happened?
4076158 4078073 He was shot in the line of duty.
4078073 4079161 Twelve years ago.
4081903 4083426 Where are you going<br />with all this?
4091652 4092740 Look.
4094829 4097048 As far<br />as the Muncie murder goes,
4097048 4098876 I wasn't there.
4098876 4101749 And if you had anything<br />to suggest that I was,
4101749 4104926 I'd be doing this interview<br />in a jumpsuit right now.
4104926 4107842 So, as far as you're concerned,
4107842 4109800 I'm Schrodinger's murderer.
4109800 4110888 Schro-what now?
4111933 4112977 At this moment...
4115806 4120202 I both did<br />and did not kill Muncie.
4120202 4122291 And with that,<br />I'm gonna get going.
4122291 4123771 What's your hurry?
4125164 4128297 I'm gonna be going away soon.
4128297 4131257 And before I do,<br />there are some things...
4131257 4132649 I better put right.
4132649 4135565 Interview suspended 10:52 a.m.
4138612 4140309 What in the fuck was that?
4140309 4141528 I don't know.
4141528 4143443 Strange fucking tactics.
4143443 4144792 So what's our next move?
4144792 4146750 Not sure.
4146750 4148056 How about we catch<br />our other killer
4148056 4149231 while I mull it over?
4165987 4167031 "Walker."
4169033 4170600 Walker. John Walker.
4173386 4174430 Damnit.
4259036 4260081 Miles?
4291939 4293157 John?
4296422 4297814 What's with the chrome?
4297814 4299250 What? Are you gonna shoot me?
4300034 4301775 The hell are you doing<br />in my kitchen?
4302819 4304691 Can't believe the key<br />is in the same spot.
4304691 4307476 - Let me get those groceries.<br />- No, no, no, no, no. No.
4307476 4309173 Don't touch the groceries.
4310479 4312133 What are you doing here?
4316398 4317399 I'm here.
4328323 4329368 Hey, I'm...
4332153 4333197 cashing out.
4334460 4335809 So there's gonna be...
4335809 4337767 gonna be some money<br />coming your way.
4337767 4342032 I don't want your money.
4342032 4344034 Let's... let's skip the part
4344034 4345732 where you pretend<br />you don't and...
4345732 4347690 I pretend to talk you into it.
4362488 4363793 Why are you cashing out?
4366143 4367188 Going away.
4369451 4370496 Of course you are.
4374021 4376153 I meant what I said<br />about the money.
4376153 4377981 I never wanted<br />anything from you...
4379374 4380462 except for you.
4382986 4385380 But I guess we both knew<br />that was too much to ask.
4395956 4397000 Yeah.
4401527 4403354 So, anyway. Uhm...
4405182 4408795 I need you to make sure<br />Miles takes his share.
4408795 4410797 That's...
4412538 4413539 That's harder.
4418239 4419936 Miles is harder.
4419936 4423244 Yeah. And have him...
4424898 4426421 So he can put...
4426421 4427814 ah... the girl...
4428858 4429903 She can go...
4430730 4431818 Go to the, uh...
4433907 4434951 You know.
4436953 4438041 Goddammit.
4439478 4440479 The big school.
4442045 4443786 College.<br />Yeah.
4443786 4445614 Yeah, uh...
4445614 4447834 Yeah.
4447834 4449444 I mean, you know,
4449444 4451664 something good has to come out<br />of all this.
4451664 4453535 How long you going away for?
4454493 4456146 There's no coming back<br />from this one.
4463153 4465547 They finally caught up<br />to you, uh?
4465547 4467375 You must be slipping.
4468898 4470465 Yeah.
4471901 4473076 Yeah, you could say that.
4487526 4488962 So, anyway...
4490790 4492269 yeah.
4492269 4493401 Okay.
4495403 4496447 All right.
4503585 4504673 Knox...
4506327 4510157 I still love you. Just a little.
4510157 4511593 As much as I hate you,
4511593 4512942 I wouldn't want to shoot you,<br />so...
4514596 4515858 call ahead next time.
4517730 4518774 Yeah.
4520210 4521647 There isn't gonna be<br />a next time.
4568519 4570609 <i>You must be<br />slipping.</i>
4579487 4581184 <i>But I guess<br />we both know</i>
4581184 4582446 <i>that was too much to ask.</i>
4589279 4591107 Knox.
4591107 4592239 Fucking...
4592239 4593414 John?
4593414 4595764 Sorry. Am I early?
4603293 4604643 No, uh...
4606035 4608864 I was just gonna... why don't I<br />jump in the shower?
4608864 4612389 Let's have a drink first.<br />I'll make you one for once.
4617394 4620571 I wasn't sure you'd want me here<br />after last time.
4620571 4622182 Why? What happened last time?
4626099 4628275 You got me worried, Knox.
4628275 4629450 Jesus, Ruby!
4629450 4631278 Don't worry about it.
4631278 4634455 I just gotta get a handle<br />on this last part of this thing.
4634455 4637023 How is the cash out coming?
4637023 4638764 I got the paintings<br />and I got the cash,
4638764 4640722 I just have<br />to get the stones here tonight.
4640722 4642028 The stones?
4642028 4644552 Yeah, the stones.
4644552 4645901 And then I gotta take them<br />to my guy.
4645901 4647555 He turns everything<br />into clean cash.
4648295 4650253 Then I just have to...
4650253 4651951 cut it into thirds.
4651951 4653082 Why thirds?
4654040 4656520 Only got three people<br />on the list. You're on the list.
4660307 4662265 I don't even<br />look like her, Knox.
4671535 4673537 Here's<br />to every Thursday afternoon.
4698519 4699694 You just get a hand job?
4701478 4703045 Better.
4703045 4705482 You're not gonna believe<br />what Tech just found.
4705482 4707484 - So tell me.<br />- No!
4707484 4710357 No. You gotta hear this<br />for yourself. Come on!
4710357 4712446 <i>Okay,</i>
4712446 4713882 everything we thought we'd find
4713882 4714927 based on his previous<br />arrest record.
4714927 4716798 Oh, God.
4716798 4718365 But where
4718365 4719453 it gets interesting<br />is in his live chats.
4719453 4720802 He was communicating
4720802 4721934 with half a dozen<br />young teen girls.
4721934 4723500 Convincing them to send nudes.
4723500 4725198 When we get the guy<br />who killed this asshole,
4725198 4726590 - we should give him a medal.<br />- First we let him loose
4726590 4727678 on a few other guys<br />I can think of.
4727678 4729071 It's always guys with you.
4729071 4730246 There's one girl
4730246 4731813 he talked to for over a year,
4731813 4733554 but then they actually started<br />to meet up IRL.
4733554 4735469 IRL?
4735469 4737123 In real life.
4737123 4739778 So say that.
4739778 4742258 They definitely<br />had sex.
4742258 4744217 A lot of sex.<br />They talked about it.
4744217 4745696 Extensively.
4745696 4746915 Anybody got a Tums?
4749875 4752660 Anyway, I was able to trace<br />her IP address.
4752660 4754314 She's a 16-year-old girl
4754314 4757099 in Silver Lake by the name<br />of Kaylee Iris Knox.
4757099 4758666 Okay.
4758666 4760450 Let's talk<br />to her and her parents.
4761582 4762888 Wait.
4762888 4764106 You said "Knox"?
4764106 4766674 I ran the family.
4766674 4768807 It's John Knox's granddaughter.
4877480 4880788 I'm sorry. Why do you want<br />to talk to our daughter?
4880788 4883834 Ah... we just have<br />a few questions for Kaylee.
4883834 4885271 And for your husband.
4885271 4886359 You guys are gonna be<br />right in here.
4888665 4890580 Oh, Mr. Knox.
4890580 4891755 Actually, we're gonna put you<br />in this room right over here.
4893279 4894367 Hang on a second.
4896630 4898937 Just be honest, okay?<br />Tell the truth.
4903767 4906509 Detective Ikari is gonna be<br />right with you.
4986111 4987808 <i>Like, what if I did?</i>
5009743 5011266 Detective Emily Ikari,
5011266 5013051 interviewing Miles Knox.<br />It is...
5014182 5015705 4:37 p.m.
5018186 5019318 Andrew Palmer.
5021537 5023104 What?
5023104 5025367 Pretty sure you know who he is.
5025367 5027543 I thought this was<br />about the fight at the café.
5027543 5029676 What fight at what café?
5033767 5034811 Okay...
5036335 5037814 What about that prick?
5037814 5039903 We know<br />what happened between you.
5039903 5041340 You called them?
5041340 5042732 You said you wouldn't call them.
5042732 5044430 - No, we didn't.<br />- No. You promised
5044430 5045909 if I went to the clinic,<br />you wouldn't tell on him.
5045909 5046997 Honey...
5046997 5048129 Kaylee, Kaylee.
5048129 5049652 Your parents didn't call us.
5049652 5051350 Neither your mom or your dad.
5051350 5053308 What's this about, then?<br />What do you want to know?
5053308 5056311 We found chats on his computer<br />between him and your daughter.
5056311 5059488 We're pretty sure<br />you know what's going on.
5059488 5061099 We know that he raped you.
5063144 5065233 H-he... he didn't rape me.
5068062 5069846 Did you arrest him?
5069846 5072806 No. He... he's not<br />in any trouble with the law.
5072806 5074329 Well, if you're asking me
5074329 5075461 if I want to press charges,<br />I don't wanna--
5075461 5076897 It's too late for that.
5076897 5077985 He's dead.
5082076 5083121 Good.
5084209 5086689 Was it an accident?<br />'Cause I hope he suffered.
5086689 5087995 I wanna show you something.
5092304 5093609 See that there?
5093609 5095611 That's your car.
5095611 5098701 Driving into the gated<br />neighborhood where Palmer lives.
5098701 5100399 This is about 20 minutes later.
5101748 5104054 See by the timestamp. See?
5104054 5105752 That's you, no doubt.
5105752 5107797 Yeah, that's me.
5107797 5109756 Yeah, I went to see him.<br />So what?
5109756 5112889 So, somewhere<br />in this time frame,
5112889 5115022 Palmer was stabbed to death<br />in his kitchen.
5115022 5116676 Wow. You can narrow the<br />time of death
5116676 5118156 to 20 minutes?
5118156 5119461 Modern science.
5119461 5120549 This is the part<br />where you tell me
5120549 5121681 you just went to warn him
5121681 5123030 to stay away from your daughter?
5123030 5124597 Yeah, it's exactly right.
5124597 5126207 And I might have punched him.
5126207 5127339 Mhm...
5127991 5129863 How did you cut your hand there?
5129863 5131430 On a glass.
5131430 5133040 We're gonna find<br />that glass in your house?
5133040 5134694 No, I was at...
5134694 5137044 What do you mean at my house?
5137044 5139133 Based on this video,
5139133 5141483 we obtained a warrant<br />for your house and your car.
5141483 5142745 They're being searched now.
5146053 5148098 I'm not gonna say another word<br />until my attorney gets here.
5148098 5150362 And that goes<br />for my underaged daughter.
5150362 5153103 Stop talking to her. Right now.
5164332 5165551 You all right?
5168554 5169685 Hey, man. Are you okay?
5175125 5176301 Yeah.
5176301 5178259 <i>We got you.</i>
5178259 5179391 Do you, now?
5179391 5181001 Don't say anything.
5181001 5182132 Sure.
5182132 5184265 I'll do the talking.
5184265 5186006 Show you what we found?
5190924 5192404 Your bloody clothes found
5192404 5194754 in a dumpster<br />behind your apartment.
5194754 5196582 What? Bullshit.
5196582 5198279 The murder weapon...
5198279 5201413 hidden in a heating vent<br />in your apartment.
5201413 5202979 No, no.<br />Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5202979 5205373 - That's not right.<br />- Miles, stop talking.
5205373 5208071 The knife has prints<br />all over it.
5208071 5209638 We'll be pulling yours<br />for comparison
5209638 5211292 in about five minutes.
5211292 5214295 Me? I'm confident.
5214295 5217907 Long, blonde hair recovered<br />from the lapel of your coat.
5217907 5220170 Would you wanna bet<br />it matches the victim?
5220170 5222303 Don't speak.
5222303 5226438 Miles Knox, I'm arresting you<br />for the murder of Andrew Palmer.
5226438 5228570 You have the right<br />to remain silent.
5228570 5230268 Anything you say<br />can be held against you
5230268 5231660 in a court of law.
5232444 5234707 Here, a little coin<br />for your trouble.
5234707 5236970 I'm good. I'm glad<br />you guys showed up.
5236970 5238058 Take care of him.
5238058 5239146 Thank you.
5241801 5244282 All kinds of people<br />make this world, don't they?
5248982 5250200 Okay, pal.
5251680 5253726 How are you even here?
5253726 5256729 I'm the last person<br />you called, see?
5256729 5259297 Give Ludmilla your keys.<br />She'll drive your Caddy back.
5259297 5261429 I can drive my own car.
5261429 5262996 It's right<br />around the corner.
5262996 5264171 50 meters away. Come.
5267305 5268828 Hey,<br />congrats on the arrest.
5268828 5270612 Thanks.
5270612 5272005 I found out why Knox went<br />to San Francisco.
5272005 5274007 He was there to see a doctor.
5274007 5276139 !Ah... Doctor...
5276139 5277532 Frederick Burns.
5278794 5280274 The neurologist?
5280274 5281362 How do you know that?
5282581 5283973 Obviously,
5283973 5285540 I couldn't get<br />any medical records,
5285540 5287325 but the guy specializes<br />in treating dementia.
5289152 5290850 Okay. Good work.
5290850 5291981 Thank you.
5294810 5297073 Did you at least<br />get what you came for?
5299511 5301556 Yeah... yeah.
5308737 5310739 Xavier...
5310739 5312175 I can only remember about...
5313263 5316136 Three hours of today.
5316136 5318181 It's like a curtain coming down.
5322142 5323448 That's rough.
5326189 5327234 Why me?
5328453 5330193 I mean, you know.
5330193 5333458 Trained killer, Army,<br />and all that, I know, but...
5333458 5334850 Why'd you pull me in?
5338114 5341857 That brain of yours.
5341857 5343381 I knew you'd understand
5343381 5344773 the training<br />I was putting you through.
5346601 5347950 You know, in all this time...
5347950 5349517 Mhm?
5349517 5351998 Never left a print behind,<br />no DNA, nothing.
5351998 5354217 Mmm...
5354217 5356655 I learned from the master.
5356655 5358178 What's your count, anyway?
5358178 5359745 Two.
5359745 5360876 Two?
5362530 5363749 Come on.
5363749 5365620 The cabbie in Chicago and...
5366839 5368318 a woman in the shower.
5371974 5374063 Two civilians. Fuck.
5375674 5376718 You know...
5377719 5380156 Muncie...
5380156 5383943 he liked to talk<br />about the targets, you know.
5383943 5385684 Pimps, drug dealers, traffickers.
5386902 5387947 Yeah.
5389035 5390428 I think it made him feel better.
5392081 5394257 He never got what it was...
5394257 5395563 really all about.
5396956 5398087 Which was?
5398087 5400960 Guys caught behind enemy lines.
5400960 5402091 That's all.
5406269 5408054 So...
5408054 5410970 We only have two steps left.
5412754 5415888 Your visit and my call.
5415888 5417237 Visit and a call.
5418934 5421328 Visit and the call,<br />visit and the call.
5421328 5422677 I can do that.
5422677 5424549 Keep the notes in your pocket.
5425898 5428814 I'll remind you when to go.
5430555 5431817 You'll be done
5431817 5432905 tomorrow.
5437692 5439433 I'm scared.
5439433 5440956 Yeah
5440956 5442044 I figured.
5458408 5459932 Hey...
5459932 5462717 I need you to do<br />one more thing for me.
5462717 5464458 Finish my cash out.
5464458 5466547 Take my stuff to Philo.
5466547 5469245 You wanna put me<br />in charge of your money?
5469245 5470769 You know I'm a thief.
5470769 5472379 You're not gonna steal from me.
5472379 5474120 No...
5474120 5475556 Probably not.
5475556 5477732 Wait here. I'll bring it out.
5477732 5479081 Okay, yeah.
5552764 5554983 I'm sorry, Knox.
5554983 5556071 It's a lot of money.
5559640 5560685 Can't argue with that.
5564863 5566995 - Now what?<br />- Get the stones.
5566995 5568083 Ah...
5570520 5572087 Easy, easy, easy.
5591193 5592673 Where you going, huh?
5592673 5594327 Eh?
5637718 5638719 Knox...
5642767 5644638 How were you gonna<br />split the take?
5645944 5647249 Four equal shares.
5650339 5651732 That's funny?
5651732 5652907 Yeah, it is.
5655649 5656955 You were gonna get a third.
5658347 5659392 What?
5660915 5662482 You were one of the three.
5663962 5665746 You're thinking of your ex-wife.
5665746 5667139 No, Annie.
5667139 5668227 It was you.
5670751 5674059 My Thursday afternoon date<br />for the last four years.
5675669 5678498 My ex-wife, my son...
5679499 5680543 and you.
5682632 5683764 All you had to do...
5685679 5686724 was nothing.
5700650 5702565 He wants to make<br />a change to the list.
5702565 5704829 Take off the last name,<br />the hooker.
5704829 5707135 No problemo.
5707135 5710312 You split it even, fifty-fifty,<br />between the wife and the son.
5710312 5712227 Carve out something for you?
5712227 5713968 No, I'm good.
5735816 5737557 What the hell, Dad?
5737557 5739385 I don't understand why you'd--
5739385 5741735 Wait, wait, wait. Stop.<br />I don't understand...
5741735 5743345 Stop. Just listen to me.
5743345 5745173 I'm so confused.
5745173 5746566 I went to you for help.
5746566 5749917 Why? Why would you<br />do this to me?
5749917 5752311 You're the reason<br />I went to prison.
5754269 5755401 I'm what?
5755401 5756706 The tax evasion thing.
5757359 5759971 You're the one<br />who ratted me out.
5759971 5761886 What the hell? I didn't know<br />anything about you back then.
5761886 5765324 I did six years because of you.
5765324 5768066 No, no. That's not true.
5768066 5769632 That's not true, Dad.
5769632 5771156 Listen to me.<br />I think you're losing it.
5771156 5772853 Something's wrong with you.<br />Why would...
5772853 5774202 Why would you<br />think I would do that?
5774202 5775290 Look at me.
5776988 5778032 It was you.
5780382 5781862 You turned me in.
5781862 5784212 I did not! I didn't do it, Dad!
5784212 5787302 That's not true!<br />Dad, listen to me! Listen to me!
5787302 5789435 Dad! Goddammit!
5789435 5790828 Listen to me!
5790828 5793308 Why would I do that<br />even if I knew!
5793308 5794396 You're wrong!
5803057 5804667 - Hey, Ikari.<br />- What?
5804667 5806365 There's a problem<br />with the Palmer evidence.
5806365 5809498 - Which evidence?<br />- All of it.
5809498 5812371 It's a first. There is a problem<br />with the blood on the clothes.
5812371 5814199 Evidence of Erythromycin.
5814199 5817245 That's a molecular breakdown<br />consistent with freezing.
5817245 5821597 The blood on the clothes was<br />frozen for at least 12 hours
5821597 5823730 before it was thawed<br />and put on the fabric.
5824644 5826037 Put?
5826037 5827603 Yeah. Same with the knife.
5827603 5829431 Wait... that's not<br />the murder weapon?
5829431 5831781 No, it definitely is,<br />and the blood is the victim's.
5831781 5833653 The issue is<br />with the fingerprints.
5833653 5835046 No. I saw the comparison.
5835046 5836264 They matched<br />Miles Knox's prints,
5836264 5837831 no question.
5837831 5839702 Yes, but they contained<br />traces of monomers.
5839702 5841922 Butyl acrylate<br />and methyl methacrylate.
5841922 5842923 Packing tape.
5843663 5845970 Also, some sort<br />of household spice.
5845970 5847449 I'm sorry, detective.
5847449 5849103 The prints on the knife<br />were planted.
5849103 5850496 Planted?
5851497 5852977 Christ...
5852977 5854892 And then, there's the hair<br />from the coat.
5854892 5856284 It's really impossible
5856284 5857416 that this was<br />the only thing we found.
5857416 5859548 I've been over this three times.
5859548 5862377 In my opinion, this jacket<br />was never anywhere
5862377 5863813 near the crime scene.
5863813 5865511 But we have the video.
5865511 5868427 Yeah... about that...
5868427 5869515 Fuck me!
5877436 5878828 Hey.
5878828 5880918 You're almost home.
5880918 5882397 One more step.
5882397 5883572 Okay.
5884660 5886924 <i>I'm gonna<br />make the call.</i>
5886924 5888664 You just sit tight.
5888664 5891189 Oh, did you get rid<br />of the notebook?
5891189 5892364 Yeah, I did.
5892364 5894105 Because this all goes to hell
5894105 5895367 if they find the notebook.
5895367 5896977 You understand?
5896977 5898370 It's gone.
5898370 5899545 <i>What did you do<br />with it?</i>
5899545 5900633 I burned it.
5900633 5901939 Okay.
5902548 5904593 I'll make the call<br />and it's over.
5904593 5906595 Yeah, good.
5906595 5908554 Hey, eh... X.
5909685 5911426 You should...
5911426 5914777 probably tell her I got<br />three dead bodies over here.
5914777 5917693 Do you have...<br />three dead bodies in there?
5917693 5919086 <i>I do.</i>
5919086 5920392 - Three?<br /><i>- </i>  [Knox] <i>Three.</i>
5923525 5925005 Oh, John.
5925005 5926093 Yeah.
5926920 5927965 Listen...
5932230 5933274 Good luck.
5937322 5938801 It's<br />almost imperceptible
5938801 5939889 to the naked eye,
5939889 5941804 but there's a jump there.
5941804 5944111 And if you go<br />into the root file,
5944111 5945678 someone clearly deleted
5945678 5947288 the original timestamp<br />and wrote over it.
5947288 5949116 Hard to spot, but it's there.
5949116 5951031 Meaning what?
5951031 5952598 He could have driven
5952598 5954208 in-and-out of the gate<br />on any day, at any time.
5954208 5956297 The footage was<br />simply spliced in.
5961781 5963522 Miles Knox was framed?
5963522 5965045 It's what it looks like.
5965045 5967700 It doesn't add up.<br />Nothing makes sense.
5967700 5969223 Detective Ikari.
5969223 5970746 - Not now.<br />- There's a phone call for you.
5970746 5972835 I said not now!<br />Okay, but...
5972835 5974272 This guy says<br />it has something to do
5974272 5975316 with John Knox.
5976491 5978232 This is detective Ikari.
5978232 5980408 <i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>
5980408 5982541 You should get up<br />to his bungalow
5982541 5984499 Why the hell would I do that?
5984499 5987067 <i>He's got<br />three dead bodies in there.</i>
5987067 5989113 <i>Who is this?</i>
5989113 5991419 An anonymous, concerned citizen.
6003605 6004954 Don't move! Do not move!
6006695 6008262 God bodies.
6008262 6010177 What happened?
6011396 6013050 Jesus, Knox.
6013050 6014529 Put your hands<br />behind your back.
6014529 6015661 All right.
6019056 6020057 Let's go.
6023669 6025366 Hey, hey! Ikari!
6025366 6026585 You're gonna want<br />to check this out.
6037770 6039424 Why would he...?
6039424 6040599 What the hell is this?
6041382 6042427 What?
6048650 6049999 Jesus Christ.
6052306 6054743 It was him.
6054743 6056441 My client won't be<br />making any statements.
6056441 6058312 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'll do the talking again.
6058878 6060097 You can wait outside.
6062490 6063883 So, Miles.
6065537 6067539 We know you didn't kill<br />Andrew Palmer.
6069149 6071673 What?<br />You're in the clear.
6071673 6073371 We're dropping all the charges.
6073371 6074981 You'll walk out of here<br />in half an hour a free man.
6074981 6077723 But first, tell me again<br />how you cut your hand.
6079551 6080595 On a broken glass.
6081509 6082902 Where?
6082902 6084512 At my father's house.
6084512 6085905 Why were you there?
6085905 6087124 Don't say anything.
6095175 6097743 At least...<br />tell me about your dad.
6097743 6099353 In general terms.
6099353 6100528 Don't.<br />- Wait.
6104228 6105403 In general terms?
6108362 6109798 A lousy jerk.
6109798 6111713 And a hothead?
6111713 6113802 Yeah, that's right.<br />He's abusive.
6113802 6116457 He's a despicable human being.
6116457 6118067 See, I get that.
6118067 6119982 But how big a prick<br />do you need to be...
6121549 6123290 to frame your own son<br />for murder?
6127512 6128948 I don't follow.
6128948 6130645 I got all the evidence.
6130645 6133257 Everything he used to frame you<br />was in his house.
6133257 6135955 He planted your prints<br />on the murder weapon,
6135955 6137565 hid it in your wall,
6137565 6139350 put the victim's blood<br />on your clothes,
6139350 6141569 his hair on your clothes.
6141569 6143180 Put your blood
6143180 6144485 from that broken glass<br />at the murder scene.
6144485 6145704 Why would he do that?
6147009 6148620 Why does he hate you so much?
6156715 6157846 'Cause I turned him in.
6159370 6160936 What do you mean?
6160936 6162155 The tax case<br />he went to prison for.
6162895 6164636 I was the one<br />who called the IRS.
6164636 6166072 Mhm... no.
6166072 6167160 The file says that was<br />someone named--
6167160 6168335 File's wrong.
6169423 6170468 It was me.
6190227 6192577 We never could tie<br />that gun to you.
6192577 6194231 Looks like you got away<br />with that one.
6196537 6197973 But just between us...
6199845 6202282 tell me.
6202282 6204023 It was you who shot Muncie,<br />wasn't it?
6213162 6214251 Muncie coming?
6215469 6216557 Muncie is dead.
6217471 6218777 You killed him.
6222650 6224043 They have newspapers here.
6224043 6225523 Muncie likes<br />to read the newspaper.
6239711 6241539 0-5-2-3!
6245194 6246283 Sorry.
6249111 6250156 He's not doing well.
6252506 6254073 Why do you wanna see him?
6254073 6255727 He tried to frame you.
6255727 6257337 Yeah, I mean...
6257337 6259818 He still killed the man<br />who raped my daughter.
6259818 6262429 And that's okay<br />with you? Murder?
6262429 6264953 If I could, I'd dig Palmer up<br />and I'd kill him again.
6267391 6271003 By the way, they're moving him<br />to a medical facility tomorrow.
6271003 6272700 I tried to get<br />a move sooner, but...
6273788 6274920 bureaucracy.
6277270 6278706 He went so fast, didn't he?
6280012 6281318 Fortunately for you.
6282623 6283972 How do you mean?
6283972 6285974 If he hadn't been<br />losing his mind,
6285974 6288063 he might have gotten away<br />with framing you.
6288063 6289195 Lucky for me, then.
6292024 6293068 Yeah.
6319878 6321706 Hey, Dad.
6321706 6322794 Is it Sunday?
6324404 6327102 No, no. It's not.
6327102 6328365 It's Wednesday, Dad.
6329888 6331150 - Why?<br />- Well...
6333587 6334893 My son likes football.
6337722 6338766 Is that so?
6338766 6339854 Yeah.
6342379 6344381 Sometimes we go<br />to the Rose Bowl.
6349342 6351039 I bet he loves that.
6351039 6352432 Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
6354478 6355479 But...
6364749 6365837 Sunday...
6368579 6369623 I love you, Dad.
6378110 6379154 Yeah.
6451183 6453359 Who wants to get beat?<br />- I don't know it.
