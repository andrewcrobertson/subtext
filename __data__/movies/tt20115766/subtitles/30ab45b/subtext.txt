158392 160061 Cassie, can I have some coffee?
160128 161361 [Cassie] Okay.
162730 163765 [clears throat]
164431 166668 You heard about this broad<br />out in Weasley?
166734 170605 Oh, old-school,<br />newspaper, I like it.
170672 174676 Yeah... You know, the news<br />does come on your phone now,<br />it's a new thing.
174742 177111 Says the man<br />with ten thousand books.
177177 178780 Hmm. Thank you.
178846 181949 Makes her husband breakfast,<br />for 35 years.
182016 188089 One day, she starts putting<br />a little bit of antifreeze on<br />his orange juice every morning.
188156 190223 Why, was he cold?
191826 194327 [Muncie] What we got here?
194394 198465 Oh... "Empiricism<br />and the Philosophy of Mind".
198533 200735 [laughs]<br />Bunch of crock.
203037 204605 Wilfrid Sellars wrote this?
204672 208375 Yeah, interesting guy.<br />You know Wilfrid Sellars?
208442 210078 No, but I know Peter Sellars.
210144 212245 -[laughing]<br />-Okay...
214682 217652 It took this guy<br />eight months to die<br />from the antifreeze.
218853 220420 That's dedication.
220487 222790 You gotta give her points<br />for tenacity.
222857 225193 Come on.<br />Eight months?
225258 227427 Can you imagine hating<br />anyone that much?
227494 230865 Honestly? I can think<br />of a few candidates, yeah.
230932 231999 How did they catch her?
232066 234135 Mmm... doesn't say.
234202 236369 Maybe they...<br />[laughs]
236436 239941 Maybe when they tried<br />to embalm the guy,<br />the formaldehyde wouldn't set.
240007 244045 "I pumped two barrels<br />of that shit into him<br />and it keeps leaking out."
244112 246547 Put him in the deep freeze<br />and he's still warm.
246614 250118 [laughs]<br />That's good, that's good.
250184 253054 -Thank you.<br />-Hi there, Cassie.
253121 256023 Cassie, can I get a coffee?
256090 257324 Already got you.
258492 261796 I guess I need it.
261863 262997 [sighs]
264966 266466 You're such a skinny dude.
266534 268836 Where you put all that?
268903 272006 My old man said I have<br />a hollow cock.
272073 273708 [laughs] Really?
273775 276677 Your father said that,<br />"hollow cock".<br />Interesting.
276744 278946 Yeah, he's a philosopher, too.
279013 280715 [laughs]
285086 286988 I'm going to go<br />right to the airport from here.
288022 290558 I have to go out of town<br />for a couple of days.
290625 292325 -You? What for?<br />-Yeah.
292392 294228 Personal stuff, no big deal.
294294 297765 I'll be back the day<br />after tomorrow.<br />Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.
298699 300568 -Personal?<br />-Yeah.
300635 302003 Good.
302570 304972 Because if Jericho found out<br />you went out of town on a job...
305039 307108 Give me a little credit,<br />I don't have a death wish.
307175 308910 Then why are you even going?
308976 311112 Like I said, personal.
311179 312613 No big deal.
312680 315348 I'll be back tomorrow.
315415 316951 -Okay.<br />-[Knox] Yeah.
324457 325827 [utensils clattering]
328095 329462 Are you okay?
330264 331966 Good.
332033 333466 [Muncie] Okay...
335335 336704 I'm going to get the check.
336771 338940 The check? We just got<br />the plate of food.
339006 342276 I know but I...<br />don't want to be late,<br />I have to get to the airport.
342342 344178 You got five minutes<br />to eat some food.
344245 347414 -[Knox] Hurry up,<br />take five minutes.<br />-Jesus Christ...
349750 352887 All right, anything<br />comes up, call me.
352954 354322 What the hell?
354387 356157 When did you get<br />the new car?
356224 359060 Oh... Eh... Oh.
362263 365398 So, you're not even going to<br />tell me where you're going now.
365465 367235 I'll tell you when I come back.

387088 388488 Ehm...
389624 391592 [grunts and clicks tongue]
395363 396597 Car.
397932 399767 [loud buzzing]

425059 427494 [clattering]
429697 430932 [door opening]
433000 434035 How are you today?
435202 437905 Well... you tell me.
437972 442310 My initial suspicions<br />were incorrect.
442376 444011 It's not Alzheimer's.
445880 447381 Okay.
447447 449482 What is it?
449550 452920 You're suffering<br />from a condition known<br />as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
452987 456456 It presents initially in much<br />the same way as Alzheimer's.
456524 457792 So, what's the difference?
457858 459226 Speed of progression.
462063 466100 I'm guessing...<br />you don't mean it's slower.
468102 470137 In your case,<br />it's incredibly fast.
475710 477178 What's the treatment?
477244 478546 There's no treatment.
481349 484852 The thing you have to<br />remember about dementia
484919 487555 is the thought-feeling<br />connection.
487621 489724 You have a thought,<br />creates a feeling.
489790 492893 You lose a thought,<br />you're left with a feeling.
492960 495763 So, you'll be going along<br />and...
495830 499767 all of a sudden, you'll be<br />unreasonably happy<br />and you won't know why.
499834 505239 Or you'll have<br />this wave of depression<br />and you won't know why.
505306 509076 You'll find yourself...<br />[echoing] forgetting people,
509143 512346 even those you have<br />a connection with.
512413 515549 You'll become displaced<br />in time and space...<br />[distorting and fading]
515616 518219 [muffled sound]
523824 528829 Right now, you're mostly lucid<br />with small patches of confusion<br />and mental lapse.
528896 530631 So, then it'll reverse.
530698 532733 The moments of lucidity<br />will become the exception
532800 534702 and eventually,<br />go away altogether.
534769 536771 How much time do I have?
536837 539306 It's progressing<br />more aggressively<br />than I would like...
539373 540941 -Uhm...<br />-How much time?
542643 547415 You're looking at weeks,<br />not months.
547481 552887 If you have any arrangements<br />to make, I suggest you do so<br />as quickly as possible.
552953 555756 Do you have family<br />that can take care of you?
558359 560961 -None that would.<br />-[doctor] All right.
561028 565299 Then, I suggest you look<br />into care facilities.
567735 571038 This is a very good place...
571105 572740 in your area.
582416 584318 I'm sorry.
584385 586987 That's okay, doc.
587054 589790 Even if I hated you<br />for telling me,
589857 591859 I'd forget soon enough.

620421 623290 [Annie] Secrets are secrets,<br />so I can't tell you.
623357 625626 [Knox laughs]
625693 630431 -[Annie] I finished<br />the last book you lent me.<br />-[Knox] Oh, yeah?
630498 633200 What did you think?
633267 636103 I liked it but<br />the end was stupid.
636170 638439 Really?
638507 642309 He just lets them chop off<br />his head while the other guy<br />walks away?
642376 649316 Well, see... His whole<br />character arc leads<br />to that moment. You know?
649383 653654 It's a... sacrifice<br />for the greater good,<br />you know?
653721 656490 Mmm...<br />like the end of "Casablanca"?
656558 658627 Yeah, like the end<br />of "Casablanca," exactly.
658692 661028 It was bullshit, too.
661095 663097 Rick would take the girl<br />10 times out of 10.
663164 667101 "A far, far better thing"<br />my ass.
667168 668637 Wow.
668702 671105 Is everyone from Kraków<br />that cynical?
671172 673908 I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.
676410 678846 What day is it?
678913 681448 -Thursday?<br />-No, no, I mean...
681516 682816 I mean what date.
682883 684451 The fifth, does that<br />mean something?
684519 686555 [sighs]
686621 689089 It's my son's birthday,
689156 693727 who hasn't spoken with me<br />many, many years.
697599 700434 Why does he hate you so much?
700502 706073 I'm what the Science journals<br />refer to as a "lousy father."
706140 707542 Mmm...
707609 710844 -He found out<br />what I did for a living.<br />-[woman] Yeah?
710911 713247 -Yeah.<br />-[woman] What do you do<br />for a living?
713314 714549 I work for the IRS.
714616 716817 Just like that, I hate you too.
718352 722990 I've been coming here<br />once a week for almost...<br />four years
723057 726528 and that's the first thing<br />you've said about yourself.
726595 730097 What do you want to know?<br />I'll tell you anything,<br />just ask me.
730164 732701 Is that your real name,<br />Aristotle?
732766 734868 No, it's a nickname
734935 738405 the guys in my platoon<br />gave me, I was<br />in the first Gulf War
738472 742510 and I used to read a lot<br />of books, like philosophy<br />and... like that.
743477 745045 [phone vibrating]
749783 751218 I got to go.
752654 754955 [sighs]
762896 766601 The thing with your son<br />explains a lot, though.
766668 768435 What do you mean?
768503 771839 You know how they say<br />haunted houses have<br />cold spots?
773073 777845 Stand in certain areas,<br />and a chill goes down your spine<br />like an artic breeze.
777911 779681 What the hell<br />you're talking about?
779748 783284 That's what's like here.<br />You walk in the door<br />and you feel it.
783350 785419 Only it isn't a ghost.
785486 786787 What is it?
786854 788956 Loneliness.
790525 793427 See you next Thursday,<br />not really Aristotle.
797898 800167 -[Muncie] This guy's<br />a piece of work.<br />-[Knox] I don't care.
800234 802202 Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>
802269 803837 Why do we always<br />have to go through this?
803904 805439 Why do we have to<br />go through what?
805507 807776 You ask me if I want to know<br />the details of the job
807841 810344 and I say, "no, I really don't"<br />and then you tell me<br />the details of the job
810411 813047 and then I say, "shut up" and<br />we go through it again and again
813113 815049 and we always go through<br />the same thing<br />every fucking time!
815115 818252 The question is,<br />why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
818319 819253 Ready.
819320 823792 [mariachi music in background]
823857 827261 Hey, this could be<br />my last job for a while.
827328 829597 What the fuck is going on, John?
829664 831766 Nothing, I just need to<br />take care of a few things
831832 833167 I'll clear it with Jericho.
833233 835269 Okay, how long are you<br />going to be out?
836538 837572 Hard to say.
838573 840508 Come on.<br />Let's go.
840575 843444 This motherfucker sells<br />men for human labor,<br />that's a thing now.
843511 845379 Jesus Christ.
845446 846980 -I thought trafficking<br />was like sex shit.<br />-Same thing every time.
847047 848882 Didn't we just go<br />through this at the car?
851018 853788 Why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
853854 858793 Because in ten minutes,<br />Tommy, he's not going to<br />be anybody.
858859 860294 Let's go get this done.

1027729 1028763 Yeah.
1029898 1032032 Well, we were...
1032099 1034569 expecting only one person<br />to be there.
1035537 1036671 We got split up.
1037872 1041643 I guess he figured...<br />I don't know,<br />we could cover more ground.
1043076 1046179 And I heard shots...
1046981 1049082 [muffled sound]
1050284 1051519 Christ, Tommy.
1053755 1055088 [Muncie moaning]
1055155 1056624 I didn't mean to.
1060127 1063163 -Knox...<br />-I'm sorry, Tommy.
1067001 1068235 [thud]
1072707 1073741 Yeah, he was.
1075777 1079814 <i>Yeah. I made sure the scene</i><br /><i>was clean and then I left.</i>
1086119 1087321 Okay.
1088221 1089456 Thank you.
1095495 1096798 [camera shutter clicking]
1101401 1102637 [camera shutter clicking]
1106908 1108843 You're buying this?
1108910 1110912 Five bullets, three victims?
1110979 1113480 Had to happen fast.
1113548 1115783 Are you thinking<br />there's a third shooter?
1115850 1117484 There's no evidence of that.
1120287 1122624 Growing up, I hated my mother.
1122690 1124291 Is that right?
1124358 1128730 She was a stereotype,<br />overbearing, Asian,<br />hellicopter mom.
1128796 1130999 An "A" minus meant<br />I didn't have any pride.
1131065 1132600 My mother was a drunk, so...
1132667 1134334 -This is about me.<br />-Sorry.
1134401 1137270 She hates my chosen profession<br />but, ironically,
1137337 1140575 made me a good detective.
1140642 1143778 Realizing her wanting me<br />to excel was about her<br />and not me,
1143845 1145113 [camera shutter clicking]
1145178 1147015 gave me my first lesson<br />in motive.
1147081 1149684 She taught me that the details<br />were important.
1149751 1152553 The answers lie<br />in the little things<br />other people,
1152620 1154589 she meant white people,<br />overlook.
1154656 1157224 With all due respect,<br />is this going somewhere?
1157290 1158893 There's water<br />all over the floor.
1158960 1161996 That means the shower was on<br />when the curtain came down.
1162063 1164098 [Rale] Okay.
1164164 1166233 -So?<br />-So,
1166299 1170337 he killed them,<br />they killed him, all in a hurry,<br />bang, bang, bang.
1171973 1173373 Who turned off the shower?

1217185 1218853 Sit down.<br />Want a drink?
1218920 1222123 Yeah. Yeah, whisky.
1222190 1224726 So...
1224792 1228129 you just swing by<br />to say hello?
1228196 1229864 No, closing out.
1229931 1232432 I have to do it<br />pretty quick, too.
1232499 1234202 -Quick?<br />-Yeah.
1234267 1236336 -Jericho knows?<br />-He can't.
1237105 1239239 That makes it tough.
1239306 1240775 Raise your commission, I guess.
1242643 1246981 I'm uh...<br />I'm going away.
1247048 1248850 For good this time.
1248916 1251753 And I don't want this<br />blowing back on Jericho.
1251819 1252954 What happened?
1253020 1254555 A job went South.
1254622 1258159 I set the scene out to buy<br />myself some time but...
1258226 1261361 -It's not going to last long.<br />-I'm sure about that.
1261428 1263396 Three people,
1263463 1265398 all shot each other<br />with the same gun.
1266366 1267835 Yeah, that's not good.
1269203 1271139 My gun.
1271205 1272507 -That's worse.<br />-Yeah.
1273306 1276244 So time is of the essence.<br />How do you have your capital.
1276309 1280782 Mostly cash.<br />Got some paintings<br />you got to sell. Some stones.
1280848 1283751 -That's simple enough.<br />-Yeah.
1287655 1289190 A list of three people.
1289257 1291291 All three, equal shares.
1291358 1293961 Nothing in here<br />for Muncie's family?
1294028 1295630 Muncie didn't have anybody.
1297464 1300668 I can't have any of this<br />touch those people.
1300735 1302670 This money has to be clean.
1305405 1308776 Gather your assets,<br />I'll set it up.
1308843 1312013 -A couple of days.<br />-Hey, this stays<br />between you and me.
1312079 1315983 Yeah, and I'm going to tell who?
1316050 1317919 All right.
1317985 1319386 All right, thanks.
1324491 1326493 [birds singing]
1333701 1335335 [machinery beeping]
1347380 1350651 -What's up?<br />-This key doesn't work<br />on the... uh...
1352153 1354354 -The thing, the...<br />-Lock?
1354421 1356389 -Lock, yeah.<br />-All right.
1356456 1359426 Yeah, the green ones,<br />they go to our other facility,<br />out in Van Nuys.
1359492 1360728 Okay.
1362462 1363898 Hey, could you do me a favor?
1363965 1366767 Could you... uh... write down<br />the number...
1366834 1368435 -The address?<br />-The address.
1368502 1369904 Yeah, got you.
1372106 1373674 [crickets chirping]
1381182 1382884 [doorbell]
1386153 1387688 [knocking]
1393527 1394996 [aggressive knocking]
1397397 1399567 [doorbell]
1399634 1401836 [wood floor creaking]
1403070 1405072 [aggressive knocking]
1419587 1421155 Sorry, I didn't mean to...
1421222 1423891 just to show up like this,<br />I should've called.
1423958 1427528 I didn't mean to ambush you,<br />I'm sorry.
1427595 1429130 Do I know you?
1431899 1434936 Okay, I guess I deserve that.
1435002 1439173 You got to know I wouldn't<br />be here unless I was desperate.
1439240 1441709 Okay? I need your help.
1444045 1447181 Dad, could you please<br />just talk to me?
1447248 1448481 Dad.
1449550 1451552 Miles... yeah.
1452987 1456624 Sure, Miles.<br />Come here.<br />Come on in.
1456691 1460828 Thank you, I just...<br />[clears throat]
1460895 1464131 -Have a seat.<br />-[exhales]
1464198 1469637 [glass clanking]
1469704 1472907 [cork popping]
1472974 1477578 No, no, no,<br />I'm... I'm sober.<br />Nine years.
1484484 1486754 That's your blood?
1486821 1490925 Yeah, my hand is... Uhm...
1490992 1493894 I cut it in a...
1493961 1496864 This is my blood<br />and that's someone else's.
1496931 1498466 Holy fuck!
1498532 1501002 [sobbing]
1501068 1502103 [exhales]
1504372 1505773 I fucked up.
1507608 1510177 I fucked up really bad.
1510244 1512513 Okay... okay.
1512580 1516017 Okay, take it easy.
1516083 1517718 Catch your breath.
1517785 1519987 -[exhales]<br />-Tell me what happened.
1523391 1525126 I killed someone.
1526861 1528629 Did they deserve killing?
1532500 1534869 Okay, start there.
1536404 1538672 [Miles] Okay.<br />[clears throat]
1538739 1541876 [exhales] You have<br />a granddaughter.
1541942 1545413 -Kaylee.<br />-How did you know about her?
1545479 1548215 Your mother told me,<br />right after she was born.
1550151 1552553 Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.
1552620 1555923 What is she, like 12? 13?
1555990 1557925 She's 16.
1557992 1559660 Here...
1564598 1567168 -Cute kid.<br />-Yeah.
1567234 1568269 She's a kid.
1571305 1572940 And she met this guy...
1574408 1576177 Online. This...
1576243 1578679 piece of shit!
1578746 1580681 The guy was 32 years old.
1580748 1585086 This son of a bitch<br />gets her pregnant.
1585152 1587855 She's 16 years old,<br />she's my little girl.
1587922 1591892 So, I go over<br />to his house, you know?
1591959 1594962 I was just going to put<br />the fear of God on him.
1595029 1598833 And I show up and he's...<br />[exhales and sniffs]
1598899 1601335 more than I expected.<br />Okay?
1601402 1603104 [sniffs]
1604238 1607074 He wouldn't shut up.<br />Just kept talking,
1607141 1609643 and talking and talking<br />about my fucking daughter.
1609710 1614014 Like, saying shit about her,<br />like... "she loves it,"<br />"She wanted more."
1614081 1618085 Called her "ripe."<br />Called her ripe, dad!
1618152 1622056 [groans] Fuck!<br />I just lost it.
1622123 1625326 So I grabbed a knife<br />and I sho...
1625392 1627661 I shoved it into his neck.
1630532 1632933 And I stabbed him.
1633000 1636103 I just... couldn't stop.
1636170 1637371 [muffled scream]
1638305 1639707 I didn't care.
1640941 1643177 Because I wasn't even<br />in the room, I was...
1644311 1645346 [exhales]
1651620 1652853 Did you bury this guy?
1653854 1655256 Did I bury him?
1655322 1657124 [Knox] Yeah.
1657191 1659226 No, why?
1659293 1662263 Because if you did, I was<br />going to dig him up<br />and kill him again.
1663764 1664999 [exhales]
1666433 1667668 [exhales]
1668637 1670271 Oh, my God...
1671739 1673140 So, why did you come to me?
1676944 1679346 Are you kidding?<br />[laughs]
1680748 1682917 Well, I mean...
1682983 1687321 You're the only person<br />I know that can... I...<br />This isn't my world.
1687388 1691825 -I don't know how to...<br />-Get rid of a body.
1691892 1695530 I never asked you<br />for anything in my life.
1695597 1700701 Okay? And I'm here because<br />I had nowhere else to go.
1700768 1702770 Now you need me.
1702836 1705105 [Miles] Yeah,<br />that's what this is,<br />I'm desperate.
1705172 1708342 Okay? I'm so fucking desperate<br />that I'm here, at your house,
1708409 1710978 asking you for help.<br />Now, are you [shouting]<br />going to help me or not?
1711045 1714048 [crickets chirping]
1722056 1723891 Where's the murder weapon?
1749750 1751185 Here.
1751252 1753087 Put your clothes<br />in that plastic bag,
1753153 1755389 then take a shower<br />and scrub down everything.
1755456 1757592 Underneath the fingernails,<br />clean everything.
1757659 1761095 Then, afterwards,<br />I'm going to wrap and clean<br />that hand of yours.
1761161 1763297 -Then what?<br />-Then?
1763364 1768369 You go home to your wife<br />and you never<br />mention this again.
1768435 1770739 My whole life, I never<br />asked you for anything.
1770804 1773974 Yeah, you said that already.
1774041 1778912 Here, use that. I'm going to<br />need those boxers, too.
1782950 1786020 Hey, where's the body?
1857991 1860562 Write it down.<br />Write it down.
1890090 1892926 [suspenseful music]
1942943 1947080 [football match in Spanish]
1947147 1949684 [groaning]
1953788 1955022 [thud]
1983718 1984752 [grunting]
2068268 2070605 [crickets chirping]
2085152 2086621 There you are.
2089222 2090658 What are you doing?
2091993 2093226 Nothing.
2096731 2098600 I talked to her.
2100001 2101234 [Miles]<br />What did she say?
2103771 2105907 She wants you to take her.
2105974 2107008 [Miles] What?
2108108 2113014 Well, I assumed this would be...<br />you know, like,<br />a mother-daughter thing.
2113081 2115683 Well, apparently it isn't.
2117150 2118886 What happened to your hand?
2128261 2129764 I have to tell you something.
2134035 2137237 [tension music]
2139373 2140842 All right, what do we got?
2140908 2143243 Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.
2143310 2144746 We're waiting<br />for the Interpol jacket
2144812 2147615 but safe to say he wasn't<br />a model citizen.
2147682 2149984 The woman was local,<br />Annette Elmora.
2150051 2152352 Yeah, we're thinking<br />maybe he picked her up<br />at a club or something.
2152419 2155523 You know,<br />wrong place-wrong time<br />kind of thing.
2155590 2157825 Victim number three is<br />where it gets interesting.
2157892 2159159 Meet Thomas Muncie,
2159226 2160695 suspected hitter for Jericho.
2160762 2163196 Conspicuously missing<br />from the carnage,
2163263 2165365 this man, John Knox.
2165432 2169103 Traffic cam shot this<br />six blocks away<br />around the time of death.
2169169 2171039 Facial recognition flagged him.
2171105 2173875 -That could just be<br />a driver, though.<br />-We're sure this guy's a driver?
2173941 2175810 What's his jacket say?
2175877 2178311 Not much. He did a six-year<br />stretch for tax evasion
2178378 2180280 and that's only because<br />someone ratted them out.
2180347 2183383 Other than that<br />and his service record,<br />there's nothing on him.
2183450 2186988 Which means, whatever<br />this guy does for a living,<br />he's pretty good at it.
2187055 2188355 [Ikari] Smart, too.
2188422 2190190 According to the tax<br />auditor's notes,
2190257 2192225 John Knox holds two PhDs.
2192292 2195328 One in English Lit<br />and one in US History.
2195395 2197532 Even taught in Bucknell<br />a couple of years.
2197598 2200500 And we're thinking this guy<br />kills people for a living?
2200568 2201803 Why?
2201869 2204304 Hopefully, we'll get<br />to ask him ourselves.
2204371 2205873 What branch of service<br />was he in?
2205940 2209342 Army. He was a deep<br />reconnaissance officer.
2209409 2211478 Remind me what that is again?
2211546 2215049 Someone who goes off alone<br />behind enemy lines<br />for weeks at a time.
2215116 2218285 Then, maybe we just<br />bring him in as<br />a cooperating witness.
2218351 2220487 Friend-of-the-victim<br />kind of thing.
2220555 2222657 He might slip up<br />and give us something.
2222724 2224592 Does he seem like someone<br />who makes mistakes?
2224659 2228062 Hey, boss, check your texts.
2228129 2229764 [voices in radios]
2231465 2234836 Another body. And now,<br />we got three on my board<br />already.
2234902 2236904 Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.
2236971 2239207 That's your métier.
2239272 2241408 Métier? Really?
2242476 2245278 [salsa music playing]
2249483 2251251 -John Knox.<br />-Hey!
2251318 2252920 -Hi.<br />-Is he upstairs?
2252987 2254722 Yeah. I'm supposed to think<br />he's doing the books.
2254789 2257257 -What's he really doing?<br />-Watching TV.
2257324 2259426 -I married a little boy.<br />-Yeah.
2259493 2261361 Well, he married up,<br />that's for sure.
2261428 2262663 [Ludmilla laughs]
2266567 2269469 [Knox] Xavier!<br />Coming up.
2271806 2276376 [voices on TV]
2281481 2283885 Look at this skinny<br />son of a bitch.
2283951 2288222 They rescued him<br />from a big cat sanctuary.
2288321 2291125 Locals toss him stray dogs<br />in a cave
2291192 2293161 so he can have something to eat.
2293227 2295096 Kind of reminds me of you.
2295163 2297765 You know,<br />when I first found you<br />after your war.
2299499 2300935 I never ate a dog.
2302703 2305540 [Philo] What's this,<br />grocery list?
2305606 2308142 It's a plan,<br />and I'm going to need<br />your help.
2308209 2309544 Just read it.
2313214 2314916 Hey, Ludmilla looks good.
2316017 2322089 She still hasn't realized<br />what a mistake she made<br />marrying me.
2322156 2324091 You're learning any Russian?
2324158 2327628 Just the stuff she says<br />I need to know.
2327695 2330298 "Yes, dear."<br />"Please."
2330363 2331799 All the essentials.
2335303 2337505 Okay, lay it on me.
2339073 2340908 Stabbed at least 17 times.
2342543 2345378 I put time of death between<br />3:00 and 8:00 p.m.<br />yesterday afternoon.
2345445 2348249 I'll get a more precise<br />time frame when<br />I get him to the shop.
2348316 2350383 -All right.<br />-Yeah.
2350450 2352553 Thanks, bro.
2352620 2354722 There's no murder weapon yet,
2354789 2357158 but there's a knife missing<br />from that kitchen block.
2357225 2359594 I mean, it doesn't even look<br />like anything was stolen.
2359660 2363831 He's got an expensive watch<br />on his wrist, he's got a wallet<br />full of large bills...
2363898 2367802 I know this racist<br />piece of crap. His name<br />is Andrew Palmer.
2367869 2371138 He moves cash around<br />for the Aryan Brotherhood<br />but... he's a cog.
2371205 2373841 -Not a shot caller.<br />-So, he winds up dead.
2373908 2376077 There's no big mystery there.
2376143 2379547 But he also did a stretch<br />a few years back<br />for kiddie porn.
2379614 2382516 And this...<br />this doesn't look<br />like business.
2382583 2384518 This looks personal.
2384585 2387655 Detective, gate guard out front<br />says he was knocked out<br />last night.
2388856 2389891 I got this.
2391792 2394829 Bag the victim's computers,<br />any flash drives and discs.
2394896 2397098 -What are we looking for?<br />-You'll know when you see it.
2397164 2400234 Oh, and see if you can find<br />his phone, he didn't have it<br />on him.
2400301 2401535 Got it.
2403170 2406140 [voices on radios]
2407842 2410011 So, how long have you known?
2410077 2411946 Uh... not long.
2413080 2415583 Doc says this thing<br />moves pretty fast.
2415650 2418085 Oh, Jesus, Knox.
2418152 2420888 I can't think of anything worse.
2420955 2422890 Except maybe your pecker<br />stops working.
2422957 2429030 Actually, I'm looking forward<br />to forgetting some things.
2429096 2434302 Muncie... Christ.<br />I can't imagine what the--
2434368 2436003 That's like me shooting you.
2436070 2438339 I don't even remember<br />doing it. I mean, I know...
2438406 2441842 I know I did it but I have<br />no recollection of the event.
2441909 2444045 Well, count your blessings.
2445112 2449617 -This is a radical plan.<br />-It's the only way<br />I can figure it.
2449684 2453354 This kid's DNA is<br />all over the place.
2453421 2456991 He actually bled on the guy,<br />he's got his fingerprints<br />everywhere.
2457058 2459827 He might as well just<br />signed off on the job.
2459894 2461829 Still, if you don't<br />pull this off,
2461896 2466033 -you're both fucked.<br />-[Knox] Yeah.
2466100 2468636 -I'm fucked either way.<br />-That's true.
2468703 2471105 That's why I'm asking you<br />to help me.
2471172 2476711 Look, just check in with me.<br />Just check in with me<br />now and then. You know?
2476777 2479714 -Make sure I'm on point.<br />-Yeah, of course, sure.
2479780 2485152 Just so you don't ever thing<br />this stupid plan is my idea.
2485219 2486954 I'm sure you'll remind me.
2489056 2490758 You want to know<br />the funny thing?
2490825 2493394 Let's say I pull this thing off,
2493461 2495663 I won't even know<br />if I did it or not.
2495730 2497932 It's encouraging.
2497999 2500735 This plan is<br />precision work, man.
2500801 2502903 -One hair out of place--<br />-Oh, I know.
2504405 2506440 I know.
2506507 2508676 I know I could pull this off.
2508743 2510177 The question is, can you?
2511245 2514382 So, you didn't see his face,<br />didn't see his height, nothing?
2514448 2515483 -No.<br />-Okay.
2515549 2516984 All right, thank you.
2519153 2520087 [blows out]
2520154 2521088 Beautiful day.
2521155 2522123 Sure.
2522923 2525092 What did you get?<br />Don't suppose he can<br />ID our killer.
2525159 2527294 No, he was attacked<br />from behind.
2527361 2530431 He didn't see anything.<br />Happened a little before<br />three in the morning.
2530498 2534301 Doesn't fit the timeline.<br />M.E. said he was killed<br />before 8:00 p.m.
2534368 2536771 [Rale] So you think the attack<br />on the guard is unrelated?
2536837 2539273 It's related, I'm just...<br />not sure how, yet.
2539340 2541510 They get anything off<br />these security cameras?
2541575 2545346 Well, that part is weird.<br />They feed into a DVR<br />in the utility closet.
2545413 2548015 -There's no hard drive.<br />-You mean it doesn't work?
2548082 2550418 No, I mean the tech<br />couldn't get playback
2550484 2552653 so we opened up the DVR<br />and looked inside,<br />no hard drive.
2552720 2554822 -Found his phone.<br />-[Ikari sighs]
2554889 2557625 Can't open it, though.<br />It's got one of those facial<br />recognition locks on it.
2557691 2560928 -Okay, head back inside.<br />-Okay.
2560995 2564932 -What am I looking for?<br />-His face. I assume<br />that's where it is...
2566067 2567101 Right.

2619253 2620387 [knocking]
2625426 2626794 Did you forget I was coming?
2627728 2629697 Oh... no, no.
2638172 2639206 How are you?
2642476 2645212 Good. I'm...
2645279 2647148 kind of knotted up.
2647214 2648415 That's why I'm here.
2651652 2653754 I finished the book.
2653821 2657559 It was.. better but I knew<br />he was going to die<br />in the end.
2657626 2659426 He kind of had to.
2659493 2661795 I'll find you another one here.
2665199 2666333 This is your ex?
2668702 2670704 Yeah.
2670771 2674375 -Well, she's gorgeous.<br />-Yeah.
2674441 2676343 Hey...<br />[mumbles]
2677211 2681982 put that down--<br />[distorted and silence]
2682049 2683817 Why don't I get ready?
2689390 2690724 Fuck me.
2710244 2714014 -These paintings are all real?<br />-Yeah.
2714081 2717818 -It's safer than cash.<br />-Are they worth a lot?
2717885 2721722 -Why do you have them?<br />-Part of my cashing-out process.
2721789 2723190 What?
2726060 2730197 -What do you mean "cashing out"?<br />-Forget I said it. Forget it.
2731533 2733100 Did you find me something?
2733167 2736971 [distant and echoing voice]
2737037 2740407 Hello? You picked me<br />another book?
2741909 2743310 You want a book?
2743377 2747582 Knox, are you having<br />a stroke or something?
2747649 2750918 -Maybe you should sit down?<br />-You know what? Maybe...
2752786 2754321 Maybe it's better<br />if you just go.
2756757 2758359 Good idea.
2788590 2790424 Sorry.
2790491 2794261 I just got a...<br />Got a thing I got to do.
2794328 2797865 -Same time next week?<br />-Yeah.
2799033 2800467 Yeah, you bet,<br />next week.
2800535 2802604 Are you sure you're<br />going to be okay?
2802671 2803971 Never better.
2816518 2821455 [suspenseful music]
2834134 2835369 [shutter clicking]
2838906 2840642 [elevator bell]
2840709 2842376 Here.
2843712 2845079 -Hi.<br />-Hi.
2845145 2848215 We have an appointment.<br />Last name's Knox.
2848282 2850618 Okay. All right, here it is.
2850685 2852554 You must be Kaylee.<br />And you are?
2852620 2855623 I'm the father...<br />Her father, not the...
2855690 2857625 -I'm her dad.<br />-Okay, dad.
2857692 2860829 See, sign here.<br />Initial here, here<br />and here.
2860894 2864498 Before we do the procedure,<br />the law says we have to<br />ask you a few questions.
2864566 2867067 Not about<br />the father of the child<br />or anything like that,
2867134 2869870 just to make sure<br />that <i>you</i> want to be here.
2869937 2871706 That'd be okay?
2871773 2873541 I guess so.
2873608 2874642 [nurse] Good.
2875710 2877878 Now it's your turn.
2877945 2882216 I need a couple of signatures<br />from you, starting here<br />on the consent form.
2888757 2891358 -[nurse] All right,<br />guys, have a sit.<br />-[both] Thank you.

2908676 2912413 [keeps vibrating]
2914549 2915784 Xavier, hey.
2915850 2918152 I'm calling to make sure<br />you're on track.
2918218 2922824 -On track with what?<br />-Your cockamamie plan is what.
2922891 2925325 You got your notepad?
2925392 2926994 Yeah.
2928362 2930565 Yeah, I'm on track,<br />don't worry about it.
2930632 2932099 He says "don't worry."
2932901 2936036 Do me a favor,<br />unlock your phone.
2936103 2938640 <i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>
2938706 2941609 - <i>Okay?</i><br />-Why?
2941676 2946113 Well, what if you need help<br />and you can't remember the code.
2946180 2949383 Right... right, okay.
2949450 2950885 Yeah, got it.
2950951 2952554 [sighs]
2955456 2959594 -You're there?<br />-Huh? Yeah.
2959661 2962296 I feel like I'm getting worse<br />every hour.
2965800 2967167 I'm running out of time.
2967234 2971639 So, stop wasting it<br />talking to me. Okay?

3047549 3050217 What?<br />I'm in the middle of dinner.
3051151 3052887 It's not even 4:30.
3052954 3056490 Oh, I'm almost 90.<br />Dinner time is<br />very important to me.
3056558 3058058 What's up?
3058125 3060494 [Knox] <i>Yeah, I'm looking at</i><br /><i>some kind of locker key.</i>
3060562 3062830 <i>Do you know where</i><br /><i>that's from?</i>
3062897 3065165 [Philo] <i>You never confided</i><br /><i>in me where you keep</i><br /><i>all your money.</i>
3065232 3068368 I'm a crook, you know?
3068435 3070605 All right. Great, thanks,<br />I'll figure it out.
3070672 3074074 Hey, wait a minute.<br />Did you take the passcode<br />off your phone?
3074141 3076744 Ehm... yeah, I'm going to<br />do that now.
3076811 3078513 I'll do it right now. Okay?
3078580 3081516 Thanks.<br />Say hi to Becky from me.
3081583 3085118 -Wait, who?<br />- <i>Becky.</i>
3085185 3087487 Ehm... okay.
3087555 3089857 -All right.<br />-How's he doing?
3089924 3093327 -He just called you Becky.<br />-Who's this Becky?
3093393 3095128 She was one of my wives.
3095195 3098265 I divorced her before<br />you were born, baby.
3098332 3101736 This business with Knox...<br />It's not good.
3101803 3103905 No.
3103972 3105339 It's not.

3216751 3219486 I ordered some food,<br />this place has great ribs.
3219554 3223791 I'm a vegan.<br />Should we...?
3223858 3225827 Should we be meeting<br />in public like this?
3225893 3227327 No one knows us here.
3229329 3232499 -How's the hand?<br />-Well, it...
3232567 3235103 -hurts.<br />-If anyone asks you about it,
3235169 3238673 you cut on broken glass.<br />You were at my house,<br />we were having a drink.
3238740 3241642 What? Why would I be<br />at your place?
3241709 3244612 You were looking for<br />your old Hot Wheels,<br />make something up.
3248583 3250184 -How are you doing?<br />-How am I doing?
3250250 3251986 Yeah, uhm...
3252987 3255690 Spent the day<br />at the abortion clinic with...
3255757 3259660 my 16-year-old daughter<br />so, bad, I guess.
3259727 3261461 Pretty bad.
3261529 3264966 Not sleeping, not eating.<br />I haven't eaten since yesterday.
3265032 3266333 Uhm...
3266399 3268236 My hair is falling out.
3268301 3270738 So, I'm about to lose<br />my goddamn mind.
3270805 3273741 Okay, okay.<br />You need to get a grip.
3273808 3275610 I don't know how<br />to do this, I'm not...
3275676 3277512 I'm not like you,<br />you know?
3279013 3280248 I'm not a killer.
3280313 3281549 [exhales]
3285285 3287320 You are, though.
3287387 3289757 What?
3289824 3292492 A killer.
3292560 3295696 Damn good one, too.<br />Not half-assed.
3295763 3299499 I was out at the scene.<br />Let me put it to you<br />this way:
3301135 3305540 that wasn't what you call<br />a proportional response.
3305606 3308042 -I lost it.<br />-Understandable.
3308109 3311279 But now I need you<br />to pull it all together, okay?
3311344 3314347 -You're like<br />a walking confession.<br />-I'll try harder.
3314414 3317084 No, do the opposite.<br />Relax.
3318886 3319921 Okay.
3321956 3325059 [plates clanking]
3325126 3328696 [exhales deeply]
3329462 3330698 Is she your only kid?
3333701 3340407 We... we lost one early on,<br />a miscarriage.
3340473 3342977 -Sorry, it's tough.<br />-Yeah.
3345146 3347315 More on Cheryl, actually.
3347380 3349984 What does she do, Cheryl?
3350051 3352220 Teaches fourth grade,
3352286 3354188 public school.
3354255 3358125 Yeah and... kids love her.
3358192 3360661 All right.<br />Boy, you guys are busy.
3360728 3363430 Working parents,<br />on the go all the time.
3363496 3366499 What's the typical day?
3366567 3369871 Tomorrow for instance,<br />what would you do tomorrow?
3369937 3374407 Go get breakfast somewhere<br />and walk around<br />Largemouth Village
3374474 3376811 and then Kaylee has<br />soccer and...
3376878 3379814 -You now.<br />-Do that. Do that.
3379881 3381816 -Just do that.<br />-Do that?
3381883 3385286 -[Knox] Yeah.<br />-We can't,<br />she's laid up in bed.
3385353 3388823 Don't vary your routine,<br />do what you would normally do.
3394528 3395930 [sighs]
3408776 3410477 What happened to vegan?
3410544 3412412 Fuck it, I'm starving.
3412479 3415316 I've been starving<br />for six years.
3415383 3419587 You ever take the family<br />up to the cabin?
3419654 3422523 -The hunting cabin?<br />-Yeah.
3422590 3425559 I sold it, remember?<br />You signed the papers<br />two years ago.
3428729 3430430 These are so fucking good.
3431065 3433067 Yeah.
3433134 3434936 I remember that.<br />You know anything about the...
3435703 3437605 about if the owners...<br />I mean, if they use it...
3437672 3439307 full time or...
3439373 3440374 part time?
3440440 3442043 -The buyers?<br />-Yeah.
3443911 3446047 Well, I'm not renting it<br />to them. They...
3446113 3447480 I sold it to them.
3447548 3449283 They bought it, they own it.<br />I have no...
3449350 3451285 -Right.<br />-Why would I know<br />what they do?
3451352 3452987 Okay, listen to me.
3455156 3456524 You just need to...
3457490 3458659 hold it together, okay?
3458726 3461429 We're almost there,<br />couple of days.
3461494 3462730 Okay.
3464298 3465533 Look at me.
3469270 3471238 I need you to use my balls.
3472406 3473708 What?
3473774 3476510 They're gonna connect Kaylee<br />to the dead guy.
3476577 3478079 Then they're gonna<br />question you.
3478145 3480715 If you don't think you have<br />the balls for it, use mine.
3480781 3483985 Do whatever you think<br />I would do<br />if I was on that chair.
3485152 3486486 All right?
3486554 3487822 What?
3494929 3496797 I never hated you, you know?
3498532 3499834 [Knox] Well...
3502203 3503871 Be understandable if you did.
3503938 3505773 You were a good dad<br />in your way.
3507274 3508809 I remember a lot of good.
3510511 3513614 I remember ball games.<br />I remember you teaching me...
3513681 3514949 how to hunt.
3516384 3519086 I remember you letting me<br />eat pancakes in the pool.
3522523 3525326 I worshiped you.
3525393 3526994 I wanted to be<br />just like you.
3529930 3531899 Then, you know, I found out.
3534368 3535603 And I thought...
3538139 3539640 [sighs]
3539707 3541042 What if I did?
3546247 3547248 Did what?
3548182 3550084 What if I wound up<br />just like you?
3555589 3556824 And here we are.
3561495 3562830 Yeah, here we are.
3603871 3606740 All right...<br />Gelfuso, you're up.
3606807 3610111 [Gelfuso] Okay. Scene was<br />definitely staged.
3610177 3613047 Ballistics says<br />all three victims<br />killed with the same gun.
3613114 3615783 Uh, didn't see that coming.<br />That's a fun one.
3615850 3617218 -They find the gun?<br />-[Gelfuso] Yeah.
3617284 3619753 It was the one<br />in shower guy's hand.
3619820 3621388 Five shots total.
3621455 3624458 Only prints on the gun belong<br />to the dead Spaniard.
3624959 3627361 Anybody holding out<br />for a triple murder-suicide?
3627428 3628829 That would be a neat trick.
3628896 3630364 Specially the part<br />where he reaches out
3630431 3632366 and turns off the shower<br />after he's already dead.
3632433 3634001 -[Gelfuso] Nice catch.<br />-[detective] Thank you.
3636270 3638072 What else?
3638139 3639940 [Gelfuso] I scoured<br />every surveillance camera<br />in the area.
3640007 3641976 I can't put anyone<br />in the house with Muncie.
3642042 3643978 Least of all is<br />John Knox's character.
3644044 3646013 We know Knox's movements?
3646080 3648449 [Gelfuso] He hasn't used<br />his credit card<br />since the murder.
3648517 3652987 Two days before them, he flies<br />from Burbank to San Francisco<br />for 22 hours.
3653053 3654321 Why?
3654388 3656290 [Gelfuso] That part,<br />I haven't figured out yet.
3656357 3658058 But I got him<br />on the return flight<br />then he goes dark.
3658125 3661028 I think it's time we had a chat<br />with John Knox.
3661095 3663364 Go pick him up,<br />but bring him in voluntarily.
3663430 3665366 We got nothing<br />to hold him as a suspect.
3665432 3666800 All right.
3827061 3829830 Do you know what electives<br />you're gonna take this year?
3830632 3832567 Did you get your syllabus?
3832634 3835637 Yeah, I actually ended up<br />getting a class with Michelles.
3835704 3837004 Mhm!
3839641 3841375 [customer] I got<br />a pick-up order for Anthony.
3850652 3853187 I-I just think that it might be<br />too much this year.
3853253 3855255 -[customer] Thanks.<br />-Very good.
3855322 3856924 I'm still gonna do soccer.<br />I think...
3856990 3858859 -Hey, excuse me.<br />-[customer] Yeah.
3858926 3860294 -I saw you<br />looking at my daughter.<br />-[customer] Do I know you?
3860361 3862129 -No.<br />-[woman] Hey! Oh, my God!
3862196 3863631 -[Miles] Fuck you!<br />-[muffled yelling]
3870971 3873040 [knocking]
3878979 3880582 John Knox?
3880648 3882449 Johnny Law.
3882517 3885553 We got something going on<br />we'd like to get<br />your help with.
3885620 3888523 If you could come with us.<br />Voluntarily.
3888590 3889691 [Knox] Sure.
3889758 3891191 Why not? It's my day off.
3891258 3893293 I'll grab a jacket<br />and I'll follow you down.
3893360 3895496 Or we could<br />follow you down.
3896765 3897998 Better.<br />[clicks tongue]
3898065 3899601 [chuckles]
3902771 3906541 She's on my policy. I told you,<br />and I told the last person.
3907809 3909644 It was pre-approved.
3909711 3911278 Her doctor faxed it in.
3911345 3913782 You know, we go<br />through the same fuck...
3913848 3915850 damn thing every month.
3915916 3917652 D-don't put me on hold.
3921121 3922489 [knocking]
3923357 3925527 We got Knox set up<br />in Interview Two.
3928262 3930164 Anything on the other case?<br />Homer?
3930230 3933668 Ah... the prints we found<br />don't match<br />anything on the system.
3933735 3936236 The ME confirmed<br />that there were two blood types<br />on the scene,
3936303 3940374 but hadn't had time to run<br />DNA sequencing to look<br />for a match on the second guy.
3945279 3946947 It's always "guys" with you.
3948382 3950819 -Eh?<br />-You said "the second guy."
3950885 3954889 You also said the gate card<br />was grabbed from behind<br />by "the guy,"
3954955 3956624 even though he never saw<br />his attacker.
3956691 3958292 It's always "guys" with you.
3958358 3961361 Fine. The ME has not had time<br />to run DNA sequencing
3961428 3964231 to look for a match<br />on the second<br />them, they or their.
3964298 3966634 -Is that better?<br />-Welcome to the 21st century.
3966701 3968268 [whispering] Oh, my God.
3979246 3981415 Detective. How can I help you?
3982249 3984218 Save it for the tape.
3985687 3991058 Detective Emily Ikari,<br />interviewing potential<br />material witness, John Knox.
3991124 3994228 Case number 52698.
3995095 3999199 Interview is voluntary.<br />Commencing at 10:46 a.m.
4000033 4002302 Ah... please state your name<br />for the record.
4002904 4004104 John Knox.
4004171 4006340 Ah, full legal.<br />Need the middle name.
4014414 4015617 It's not a trick question.
4015683 4017652 -[chuckles]<br />-Those come later.
4018553 4019787 John Henry Knox.
4023323 4026326 Okay. I don't know<br />what game this is,<br />but let's move on.
4028262 4031231 You said something about...
4031298 4032767 me being a witness?
4032834 4036303 I hope so. I'm working<br />on the death of your partner.
4036370 4038171 -I don't have a partner.<br />-Not anymore.
4039172 4042409 If you're referring<br />to Thomas Muncie,<br />he was an acquaintance.
4042476 4044244 We never did any work together.
4044311 4047582 I've been over the crime scene<br />a dozen times. Ah...
4047649 4049383 let me tell you<br />what I think happened.
4049449 4050484 Sure.
4051184 4053721 There were three dead bodies<br />in that room,
4053788 4055122 all shot with the same gun,
4055188 4057424 and staged to look<br />like they killed each other.
4058325 4060227 But... it was clumsy.
4060962 4064131 Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.
4064197 4066935 I think someone<br />killed Muncie by mistake
4067835 4070103 and tried to stage it<br />to cover it up.
4073340 4076176 Did you say Ikari?
4076243 4079079 Are you related<br />to Peter Ikari?
4081281 4083518 -That's my father.<br />-[Knox] Oh, hell.
4084552 4085954 I know Pete.
4086020 4087655 Get him in here.<br />I'll talk to him.
4087722 4089122 You know my father?
4089857 4093027 I just talked to him...<br />couple days ago.
4093093 4095162 He used to patrol<br />my neighborhood.
4096196 4098131 Mr. Knox, my father is dead.
4099867 4101101 What?
4103671 4105006 What happened?
4105073 4106908 He was shot<br />in the line of duty.
4106975 4108275 Twelve years ago.
4110612 4112479 Where are you going<br />with all this?
4119252 4120588 [sighs]
4120655 4121689 Look.
4123558 4125893 As far<br />as the Muncie murder goes,
4125960 4127562 I wasn't there.
4127629 4130464 And if you had anything<br />to suggest that I was,
4130531 4133801 I'd be doing this interview<br />in a jumpsuit right now.
4133868 4135870 So, as far as you're concerned,
4136604 4138706 I'm Schrodinger's murderer.
4138773 4139807 Schro-what now?
4140842 4141876 At this moment...
4144545 4149050 I both did<br />and did not kill Muncie.
4149117 4151119 And with that,<br />I'm gonna get going.
4151184 4152754 What's your hurry?
4154022 4156323 I'm gonna be going away soon.
4157190 4160094 And before I do,<br />there are some things...
4160160 4161395 I better put right.
4161461 4164599 Interview suspended<br />10:52 a.m.
4167401 4169137 What in the fuck was that?
4169202 4170303 I don't know.
4170370 4172239 Strange fucking tactics.
4172305 4173708 So what's our next move?
4173775 4175275 Not sure.
4175342 4177912 How about we catch<br />our other killer<br />while I mull it over?
4194896 4195930 "Walker."
4197932 4199634 Walker. John Walker.
4202235 4203470 Damnit.
4225927 4227360 [knocking]
4231199 4232432 [knocking]
4287955 4288990 Miles?
4320888 4322089 John?
4325259 4326561 What's with the chrome?
4326627 4328162 What? Are you gonna shoot me?
4328729 4330798 The hell are you doing<br />in my kitchen?
4331566 4333267 Can't believe the key<br />is in the same spot.
4333333 4336304 -Let me get those groceries.<br />-No, no, no, no, no. No.
4336369 4338105 Don't touch the groceries.
4339339 4341075 What are you doing here?
4345246 4346479 I'm here.
4357191 4358425 Hey, I'm...
4361062 4362096 cashing out.
4363130 4366534 So there's gonna be...<br />gonna be some money<br />coming your way.
4366601 4370538 [groans]<br />I don't want your money.
4370605 4374508 Let's... let's skip the part<br />where you pretend<br />you don't and...
4374575 4376744 I pretend to talk you into it.
4381983 4383017 [sighs]
4391359 4392827 Why are you cashing out?
4395062 4396097 Going away.
4398299 4399600 Of course you are.
4402770 4404839 I meant what I said<br />about the money.
4404906 4406974 I never wanted<br />anything from you...
4408242 4409577 except for you.
4411746 4414481 But I guess we both knew<br />that was too much to ask.
4424926 4425960 Yeah.
4430364 4432465 So, anyway. Uhm...
4433901 4437571 I need you to make sure<br />Miles takes his share.
4437638 4439840 That's...<br />[chuckles]
4441375 4442610 That's harder.
4443577 4444812 [clears her throat]
4447148 4448683 Miles is harder.
4448749 4452186 Yeah. And have him...
4453688 4455256 So he can put...
4455323 4456857 ah... the girl...
4457658 4458893 She can go...
4459593 4460861 Go to the, uh...
4462897 4463931 You know.
4464966 4465900 [sighs]
4465967 4467001 Goddammit.
4468336 4469570 The big school.
4470805 4472573 -College.<br />-[Knox] Yeah.
4472640 4474442 Yeah, uh...
4474508 4476410 Yeah.
4476476 4480480 I mean, you know,<br />something good has to come out<br />of all this.
4480548 4482450 How long you going away for?
4483150 4485119 There's no coming back<br />from this one.
4491892 4494395 They finally caught up<br />to you, uh?
4494462 4496496 You must be slipping.
4497898 4499300 Yeah.
4499367 4500668 [snorts]
4500735 4502069 Yeah, you could say that.
4516384 4517985 So, anyway...
4519620 4521155 yeah.
4521222 4522523 Okay.
4524291 4525526 All right.
4530998 4532400 [exhales]
4532466 4533768 Knox...
4535036 4538873 I still love you.<br />Just a little.
4538939 4541809 As much as I hate you,<br />I wouldn't want to shoot you,<br />so...
4543444 4544912 call ahead next time.
4546580 4547815 [Knox] Yeah.
4548949 4550751 There isn't gonna be<br />a next time.
4597264 4599733 [Ruby distorted] <i>You must be</i><br /><i>slipping.</i>
4607975 4611378 [distorted] <i>But I guess</i><br /><i>we both know</i><br /><i>that was too much to ask.</i>
4618219 4619854 [Annie muffled] Knox.
4619920 4621155 [mumbling] Fucking...
4621222 4622289 [muffled] John?
4622356 4624859 Sorry. Am I early?
4632233 4633535 No, uh...
4634569 4637471 I was just gonna...<br />why don't I<br />jump in the shower?
4637539 4641342 Let's have a drink first.<br />I'll make you one for once.
4646113 4649416 I wasn't sure<br />you'd want me here<br />after last time.
4649483 4651185 Why? What happened last time?
4654889 4657191 You got me worried, Knox.
4657258 4658325 Jesus, Ruby!
4658392 4660027 Don't worry about it.
4660094 4663330 I just gotta get a handle<br />on this last part<br />of this thing.
4663397 4665600 How is the cash out coming?
4665666 4669571 I got the paintings<br />and I got the cash, I just have<br />to get the stones here tonight.
4669638 4670804 The stones?
4670871 4672907 Yeah, the stones.
4672973 4676511 And then I gotta take them<br />to my guy. He turns everything<br />into clean cash.
4677011 4678979 Then I just have to...
4679046 4680748 cut it into thirds.
4680814 4681882 [Annie] Why thirds?
4682617 4685452 Only got three people<br />on the list.<br />You're on the list.
4689056 4691258 I don't even<br />look like her, Knox.
4700234 4702469 Here's<br />to every Thursday afternoon.
4727428 4728796 You just get a hand job?
4730397 4731832 Better.
4731899 4734368 You're not gonna believe<br />what Tech just found.
4734435 4736170 -So tell me.<br />-No!
4736237 4739273 No. You gotta hear this<br />for yourself. Come on!
4739340 4741308 [Heather] <i>Okay,</i>
4741375 4743511 everything we thought we'd find<br />based on his previous<br />arrest record.
4743578 4745412 Oh, God.
4745479 4747515 [Heather] But where<br />it gets interesting<br />is in his live chats.
4747582 4749917 He was communicating<br />with half a dozen<br />young teen girls.
4749984 4751986 Convincing them<br />to send nudes.
4752052 4754255 When we get the guy<br />who killed this asshole,<br />we should give him a medal.
4754321 4756023 First we let him loose<br />on a few other guys<br />I can think of.
4756090 4757858 It's always guys with you.
4757925 4760160 [Heather] There's<br />one girl he talked to<br />for over a year,
4760227 4762429 but then they actually started<br />to meet up IRL.
4762496 4764365 IRL?
4764431 4765899 [Heather] In real life.
4765966 4768402 So say that.
4768469 4771005 [Heather] They definitely<br />had sex.
4771071 4773173 A lot of sex.<br />They talked about it.
4773240 4774542 Extensively.
4774609 4776010 Anybody got a Tums?
4778513 4781115 Anyway, I was able to trace<br />her IP address.
4781181 4786086 She's a 16-year-old girl<br />in Silver Lake by the name<br />of Kaylee Iris Knox.
4786153 4787321 Okay.
4787388 4789423 Let's talk<br />to her and her parents.
4790491 4791726 Wait.
4791792 4792893 You said "Knox"?
4792960 4794729 I ran the family.
4795396 4797898 It's John Knox's<br />granddaughter.
4834468 4836103 [glass crashing]
4906240 4909443 I'm sorry. Why do you want<br />to talk to our daughter?
4909511 4912479 Ah... we just have<br />a few questions for Kaylee.
4912547 4915115 And for your husband.<br />You guys are gonna be<br />right in here.
4917184 4920622 Oh, Mr. Knox.<br />Actually, we're gonna put you<br />in this room right over here.
4920688 4922055 [chuckles]
4922122 4923390 Hang on a second.
4925359 4928028 Just be honest, okay?<br />Tell the truth.
4932466 4935502 Detective Ikari is gonna be<br />right with you.
4943210 4944445 [door closing]
4965900 4967367 [distorted sound]
4969236 4970971 [distorted sound]
5014749 5016751 [Miles, distorted]<br /><i>Like, what if I did?</i>
5026393 5028495 [pants]
5038272 5042175 [Ikari] Detective Emily Ikari,<br />interviewing Miles Knox.<br />It is...
5043043 5044679 4:37 p.m.
5047047 5048382 Andrew Palmer.
5050518 5051953 What?
5052020 5054154 Pretty sure you know who he is.
5054221 5056290 I thought this was<br />about the fight at the café.
5056356 5058660 What fight at what café?
5062697 5063731 Okay...
5065165 5066500 What about that prick?
5066568 5068770 We know<br />what happened between you.
5068836 5070137 You called them?
5070203 5071438 You said<br />you wouldn't call them.
5071506 5073575 -No, we didn't.<br />-No. You promised
5073641 5075710 -if I went to the clinic,<br />you wouldn't tell on him.<br />-Honey...
5075777 5076911 Kaylee, Kaylee.
5076978 5078378 Your parents didn't call us.
5078445 5079948 Neither your mom or your dad.
5080014 5081916 What's this about, then?<br />What do you want to know?
5081983 5084919 We found chats on his computer<br />between him and your daughter.
5084986 5088255 We're pretty sure<br />you know what's going on.
5088322 5090190 We know that he raped you.
5090959 5091960 [angry snort]
5092026 5094328 H-he... he didn't rape me.
5096931 5098398 Did you arrest him?
5098465 5101736 No. He... he's not<br />in any trouble with the law.
5101803 5104137 Well, if you're asking me<br />if I want to press charges,<br />I don't wanna--
5104204 5105773 [Ikari] It's too late for that.
5105840 5106874 He's dead.
5110945 5111980 Good.
5112814 5114816 Was it an accident?<br />'Cause I hope he suffered.
5115482 5117117 I wanna show you something.
5120088 5121121 [Ikari clears her throat]
5121188 5122557 See that there?
5122624 5124157 That's your car.
5124224 5127461 Driving into<br />the gated neighborhood<br />where Palmer lives.
5127528 5129463 This is about 20 minutes later.
5130497 5132900 See by the timestamp. See?
5132967 5134669 That's you, no doubt.
5134736 5135770 Yeah, that's me.
5136571 5138472 Yeah, I went to see him.<br />So what?
5138539 5141576 So, somewhere<br />in this time frame,
5141643 5143678 Palmer was stabbed to death<br />in his kitchen.
5143745 5146179 Wow. You can<br />narrow the time of death<br />to 20 minutes?
5146246 5148082 Modern science.
5148148 5150317 This is the part<br />where you tell me<br />you just went to warn him
5150384 5151886 to stay away<br />from your daughter?
5151953 5153353 Yeah, it's exactly right.
5153420 5155056 And I might have punched him.
5155123 5156223 [Ikari] Mhm...
5156691 5158760 How did you cut<br />your hand there?
5158826 5160227 On a glass.
5160293 5161896 We're gonna find<br />that glass in your house?
5161963 5163430 No, I was at...
5163497 5165499 What do you mean at my house?
5165566 5170270 Based on this video,<br />we obtained a warrant<br />for your house and your car.
5170337 5171739 They're being searched now.
5174742 5176744 I'm not gonna say another word<br />until my attorney gets here.
5176811 5179179 And that goes<br />for my underaged daughter.
5179246 5181949 Stop talking to her. Right now.
5182016 5183283 [sighs]
5193193 5194595 [muffled] You all right?
5197364 5198700 Hey, man. Are you okay?
5204005 5205139 Yeah.
5205205 5207108 [Ikari] <i>We got you.</i>
5207175 5208208 Do you, now?
5208275 5209877 Don't say anything.
5209944 5210978 [Ikari] Sure.
5211045 5213081 I'll do the talking.
5213147 5214949 Show you what we found?
5219453 5223691 Your bloody clothes found<br />in a dumpster<br />behind your apartment.
5223758 5225358 What? Bullshit.
5225425 5227128 The murder weapon...
5227195 5230230 hidden in a heating vent<br />in your apartment.
5230297 5231666 No, no.<br />Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5231733 5234202 -That's not right.<br />-Miles, stop talking.
5234267 5236738 The knife has prints<br />all over it.
5236804 5239406 We'll be pulling yours<br />for comparison<br />in about five minutes.
5239473 5242910 Me? I'm confident.
5242977 5246614 Long, blonde hair recovered<br />from the lapel of your coat.
5246681 5249016 Would you wanna bet<br />it matches the victim?
5249083 5250952 Don't speak.
5251018 5255255 Miles Knox, I'm arresting you<br />for the murder<br />of Andrew Palmer.
5255322 5257158 You have the right<br />to remain silent.
5257225 5260494 Anything you say<br />can be held against you<br />in a court of law.
5261062 5263463 [Philo] Here, a little coin<br />for your trouble.
5263531 5265867 [man] I'm good. I'm glad<br />you guys showed up.
5265933 5266934 Take care of him.
5267001 5268268 [Philo] Thank you.
5270571 5273406 All kinds of people<br />make this world, don't they?
5277912 5279312 Okay, pal.
5280480 5282482 How are you even here?
5282550 5285285 I'm the last person<br />you called, see?
5285352 5288122 Give Ludmilla your keys.<br />She'll drive your Caddy back.
5288189 5290057 I can drive my own car.
5290124 5293293 [Ludmilla] It's right<br />around the corner.<br />50 meters away. Come.
5295963 5297765 [Gelfuso] Hey,<br />congrats on the arrest.
5297832 5299200 Thanks.
5299267 5300701 I found out<br />why Knox went<br />to San Francisco.
5300768 5302904 He was there<br />to see a doctor.
5302970 5305006 !Ah... Doctor...
5305072 5306607 Frederick Burns.
5307575 5309110 [Ikari] The neurologist?
5309177 5310178 How do you know that?
5311478 5313781 [Gelfuso] Obviously,<br />I couldn't get<br />any medical records,
5313848 5316416 but the guy specializes<br />in treating dementia.
5318052 5319787 Okay. Good work.
5319854 5320955 Thank you.
5323591 5326027 Did you at least<br />get what you came for?
5328361 5330631 Yeah... yeah.
5337738 5339507 Xavier...
5339574 5341108 I can only remember about...
5342143 5344812 Three hours of today.
5344879 5347114 It's like a curtain<br />coming down.
5351052 5352553 That's rough.
5355089 5356123 Why me?
5357325 5358860 I mean, you know.
5358926 5362296 Trained killer, Army,<br />and all that, I know, but...
5362362 5363865 Why'd you pull me in?
5367034 5370403 That brain of yours.
5370470 5373808 I knew you'd understand<br />the training<br />I was putting you through.
5375442 5376878 You know, in all this time...
5376944 5378145 [Philo] Mhm?
5378212 5380915 Never left a print behind,<br />no DNA, nothing.
5380982 5383084 [Philo] Mmm...
5383150 5385452 I learned from the master.
5385519 5387054 What's your count, anyway?
5387121 5388723 [Knox] Two.
5388789 5389891 Two?
5391391 5392526 Come on.
5392593 5394695 The cabbie in Chicago and...
5395630 5397430 a woman in the shower.
5400735 5403037 Two civilians. Fuck.
5404504 5405740 You know...
5406540 5408843 Muncie...
5408910 5412680 he liked to talk<br />about the targets, you know.
5412747 5414749 Pimps, drug dealers,<br />traffickers.
5415883 5416918 Yeah.
5417785 5419520 I think it made him<br />feel better.
5420821 5423124 He never got what it was...
5423190 5424659 really all about.
5425927 5426794 Which was?
5426861 5429897 Guys caught behind enemy lines.
5429964 5431065 That's all.
5435169 5436771 So...
5436837 5439907 We only have<br />two steps left.
5439974 5441542 [sighs]
5441609 5444645 Your visit and my call.
5444712 5446180 Visit and a call.
5447715 5450184 Visit and the call,<br />visit and the call.
5450251 5451484 I can do that.
5451552 5453654 Keep the notes<br />in your pocket.
5454689 5457858 I'll remind you when to go.
5459393 5460594 You'll be done
5460661 5461896 tomorrow.
5466534 5468269 I'm scared.
5468336 5469904 Yeah
5469971 5471038 I figured.
5487288 5488689 Hey...
5488756 5491525 I need you to do<br />one more thing for me.
5491592 5493294 Finish my cash out.
5493361 5495363 Take my stuff to Philo.
5495429 5498132 You wanna put me<br />in charge of your money?
5498199 5499567 You know I'm a thief.
5499633 5501235 You're not gonna steal from me.
5501302 5503037 No...
5503104 5504372 Probably not.
5504438 5506540 Wait here.<br />I'll bring it out.
5506607 5508075 Okay, yeah.
5520521 5521989 [door opening]
5573674 5574909 [chuckles]
5581615 5583751 I'm sorry, Knox.
5583818 5585052 It's a lot of money.
5588489 5589790 Can't argue with that.
5593694 5595963 -Now what?<br />-Get the stones.
5596030 5597064 Ah...
5599400 5601102 Easy, easy, easy.
5603737 5604972 [speaks foreign language]
5619954 5621489 [man] Where you going, huh?
5621556 5623290 Eh?<br />[groans]
5624992 5628729 [groans]
5628796 5631132 [groans and coughs]
5645614 5646847 [gunshots]
5651118 5652119 [gunshots]
5652186 5654655 [sobs]
5666568 5667801 Knox...
5671405 5673741 How were you gonna<br />split the take?
5674775 5676243 Four equal shares.
5677144 5678179 [snorts]
5679280 5680549 That's funny?
5680615 5681982 [Knox] Yeah, it is.
5684519 5686020 You were gonna get a third.
5687288 5688322 [Annie] What?
5689757 5691425 You were one of the three.
5692793 5694563 You're thinking<br />of your ex-wife.
5694629 5696096 [Knox] No, Annie.
5696163 5697198 It was you.
5699400 5703103 My Thursday afternoon date<br />for the last four years.
5704539 5707441 My ex-wife,<br />my son...
5708409 5709443 and you.
5711513 5712880 All you had to do...
5714549 5715783 was nothing.
5726994 5729330 [currency-counting machine]
5729396 5731232 He wants to make<br />a change to the list.
5731298 5733668 Take off the last name,<br />the hooker.
5733734 5735704 No problemo.
5735769 5739039 You split it even, fifty-fifty,<br />between the wife and the son.
5739106 5741175 Carve out something for you?
5741242 5742776 No, I'm good.
5742843 5745246 [currency-counting machine]
5764666 5766233 What the hell, Dad?
5766300 5768102 I don't understand<br />why you'd--
5768168 5770572 -Wait, wait, wait. Stop.<br />-[Miles] I don't understand...
5770639 5772273 Stop. Just listen to me.
5772339 5773941 I'm so confused.
5774008 5775142 I went to you for help.
5775209 5777811 Why? Why would you<br />do this to me?
5778812 5781315 You're the reason<br />I went to prison.
5783250 5784118 I'm what?
5784184 5785654 [Knox] The tax evasion thing.
5786086 5788590 You're the one<br />who ratted me out.
5788657 5790725 What the hell? I didn't know<br />anything about you back then.
5790791 5794061 I did six years<br />because of you.
5794128 5796698 No, no. That's not true.
5796765 5799534 That's not true, Dad.<br />Listen to me.<br />I think you're losing it.
5799601 5802970 Something's wrong with you.<br />Why would... Why would you<br />think I would do that?
5803037 5804271 Look at me.
5805839 5807074 It was you.
5809143 5810712 You turned me in.
5810779 5812980 I did not!<br />I didn't do it, Dad!
5813047 5816050 That's not true!<br />Dad, listen to me!<br />Listen to me!
5816116 5818352 [muffled] Dad! Goddammit!
5818419 5819386 Listen to me!
5819453 5822256 Why would I do that<br />even if I knew!
5822323 5823357 You're wrong!
5831899 5833334 -Hey, Ikari.<br />-What?
5833400 5835102 There's a problem<br />with the Palmer evidence.
5835169 5836604 -Which evidence?<br />-All of it.
5838038 5841108 It's a first.<br />There is a problem<br />with the blood on the clothes.
5841175 5842777 Evidence of Erythromycin.
5842843 5845814 That's a molecular breakdown<br />consistent with freezing.
5845879 5850284 The blood on the clothes was<br />frozen for at least 12 hours
5850351 5852853 before it was thawed<br />and put on the fabric.
5853555 5854855 Put?
5854922 5856290 Yeah. Same with the knife.
5856357 5858158 Wait... that's not<br />the murder weapon?
5858225 5860427 No, it definitely is,<br />and the blood is the victim's.
5860494 5862530 The issue is<br />with the fingerprints.
5862597 5863964 No. I saw the comparison.
5864031 5865966 They matched<br />Miles Knox's prints,<br />no question.
5866033 5868369 Yes, but they contained<br />traces of monomers.
5868435 5870739 Butyl acrylate<br />and methyl methacrylate.
5870805 5871840 Packing tape.
5872373 5874609 Also, some sort<br />of household spice.
5874676 5877911 I'm sorry, detective.<br />The prints on the knife<br />were planted.
5877978 5879279 Planted?
5880047 5883518 -Christ...<br />-And then, there's the hair<br />from the coat.
5883585 5886053 It's really impossible<br />that this was<br />the only thing we found.
5886120 5888055 I've been over this<br />three times.
5888122 5892660 In my opinion, this jacket<br />was never anywhere<br />near the crime scene.
5892727 5894228 But we have the video.
5894294 5897364 [Heather] Yeah...<br />about that...
5897431 5898465 Fuck me!
5903036 5906373 [phone vibrating]
5906440 5907675 Hey.
5907742 5909744 You're almost home.
5909811 5911345 One more step.
5911412 5912413 Okay.
5913347 5915750 [Philo] <i>I'm gonna</i><br /><i>make the call.</i>
5915817 5917351 You just sit tight.
5917418 5919987 Oh, did you get rid<br />of the notebook?
5920053 5921121 Yeah, I did.
5921188 5922923 Because this all goes to hell
5922990 5924324 if they find the notebook.
5924391 5926059 You understand?
5926126 5928462 -It's gone.<br />-[Philo] <i>What did you do</i><br /><i>with it?</i>
5928530 5929531 I burned it.
5929597 5930865 Okay.
5931298 5933500 I'll make the call<br />and it's over.
5933568 5935502 Yeah, good.
5935570 5937539 Hey, eh... X.
5938606 5940174 You should...
5940240 5943444 probably tell her I got<br />three dead bodies over here.
5943511 5946648 Do you have...<br />three dead bodies in there?
5946714 5947981 [Knox] <i>I do.</i>
5948048 5949416 -Three?<br /><i>-</i> [Knox] <i>Three.</i>
5952486 5953855 Oh, John.
5953922 5955155 Yeah.
5955790 5957024 Listen...
5961061 5962296 Good luck.
5965934 5968736 [Heather] It's<br />almost imperceptible<br />to the naked eye,
5968803 5970471 but there's a jump there.
5970538 5972740 And if you go<br />into the root file,
5972807 5976076 someone clearly deleted<br />the original timestamp<br />and wrote over it.
5976143 5977946 Hard to spot, but it's there.
5978011 5979012 Meaning what?
5979980 5983016 He could have driven<br />in-and-out of the gate<br />on any day, at any time.
5983083 5985352 The footage was<br />simply spliced in.
5990692 5992259 Miles Knox was framed?
5992326 5993628 It's what it looks like.
5993695 5996598 It doesn't add up.<br />Nothing makes sense.
5996664 5998031 Detective Ikari.
5998098 5999433 -Not now.<br />-There's a phone call for you.
5999500 6001502 -I said not now!<br />-[officer] Okay, but...
6001569 6004204 This guy says<br />it has something to do<br />with John Knox.
6005272 6007040 This is detective Ikari.
6007107 6009176 <i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>
6009243 6011278 You should get up<br />to his bungalow
6011345 6013247 Why the hell<br />would I do that?
6013313 6015884 [Philo] <i>He's got</i><br /><i>three dead bodies in there.</i>
6015950 6017952 [Ikari] <i>Who is this?</i>
6018018 6020454 An anonymous,<br />concerned citizen.
6032366 6034067 Don't move! Do not move!
6035435 6037070 [officer, muffled] God bodies.
6037137 6039273 [echoing] What happened?
6040207 6041676 Jesus, Knox.
6041743 6043176 -Put your hands<br />behind your back.<br />-All right.
6047916 6049149 [officer] Let's go.
6052620 6054154 Hey, hey! Ikari!
6054221 6055590 You're gonna want<br />to check this out.
6066701 6068201 Why would he...?
6068268 6069503 What the hell is this?
6070203 6071438 What?
6076544 6077579 [sighs]
6077645 6079112 Jesus Christ.
6081148 6082316 It was him.
6083518 6085218 [woman] My client won't be<br />making any statements.
6085285 6087387 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'll do the talking again.
6087789 6089222 You can wait outside.
6091291 6092827 So, Miles.
6094328 6096564 We know you didn't kill<br />Andrew Palmer.
6097799 6100133 -What?<br />-[Ikari] You're in the clear.
6100267 6103370 We're dropping all the charges.<br />You'll walk out of here<br />in half an hour a free man.
6103437 6106708 But first, tell me again<br />how you cut your hand.
6108342 6109577 On a broken glass.
6110310 6111779 [Ikari] Where?
6111846 6113280 At my father's house.
6113347 6114782 Why were you there?
6114849 6116249 [Lawyer] Don't say anything.
6124025 6126661 At least...<br />tell me about your dad.
6126728 6128161 In general terms.
6128228 6129463 -[Lawyer] Don't.<br />-Wait.
6133101 6134468 In general terms?
6137204 6138706 A lousy jerk.
6138773 6140440 And a hothead?
6140508 6142510 [Miles] Yeah, that's right.<br />He's abusive.
6142577 6145245 He's a despicable human being.
6145312 6146714 [Ikari] See, I get that.
6146781 6148916 But how big a prick<br />do you need to be...
6150350 6152386 to frame your own son<br />for murder?
6156323 6157825 I don't follow.
6157892 6159393 I got all the evidence.
6159459 6162096 Everything he used to frame you<br />was in his house.
6162162 6164832 He planted your prints<br />on the murder weapon,
6164899 6166333 hid it in your wall,
6166400 6168168 put the victim's blood<br />on your clothes,
6168235 6170138 his hair on your clothes.
6170203 6173273 Put your blood<br />from that broken glass<br />at the murder scene.
6173340 6174709 Why would he do that?
6175910 6177645 Why does he hate you so much?
6185485 6186821 'Cause I turned him in.
6188221 6189624 What do you mean?
6189691 6191059 [Miles] The tax case<br />he went to prison for.
6191592 6193360 I was the one<br />who called the IRS.
6193427 6195863 [Ikari] Mhm... no.<br />The file says that was<br />someone named--
6195930 6196964 File's wrong.
6198265 6199499 It was me.
6216884 6219053 [cell opening]
6219120 6221354 We never could tie<br />that gun to you.
6221421 6223323 Looks like you got away<br />with that one.
6225358 6226928 But just between us...
6228796 6229831 tell me.
6231165 6232967 It was you who shot Muncie,<br />wasn't it?
6242043 6243343 Muncie coming?
6244311 6245613 Muncie is dead.
6246313 6247782 You killed him.
6251451 6252720 They have newspapers here.
6252787 6254589 Muncie likes<br />to read the newspaper.
6264832 6265967 [phone rattling]
6268502 6270337 [guard] 0-5-2-3!
6270403 6271906 [buzzing]
6274075 6275375 Sorry.
6278012 6279279 He's not doing well.
6281348 6282950 Why do you wanna see him?
6283017 6284685 He tried to frame you.
6284752 6285953 Yeah, I mean...
6286020 6288556 He still killed the man<br />who raped my daughter.
6288623 6291058 And that's okay<br />with you? Murder?
6291125 6293928 If I could, I'd dig Palmer up<br />and I'd kill him again.
6296030 6299700 By the way, they're<br />moving him<br />to a medical facility tomorrow.
6299767 6301736 I tried to get<br />a move sooner, but...
6302770 6303905 bureaucracy.
6306140 6307742 He went so fast,<br />didn't he?
6308943 6310443 Fortunately for you.
6311444 6312680 How do you mean?
6312747 6314682 If he hadn't been<br />losing his mind,
6314749 6316951 he might have gotten away<br />with framing you.
6317018 6318318 Lucky for me, then.
6320955 6321989 Yeah.
6328428 6329797 [buzzing]
6348850 6350483 Hey, Dad.
6350551 6351786 Is it Sunday?
6353254 6355990 No, no. It's not.
6356057 6357490 It's Wednesday, Dad.
6358425 6360094 -Why?<br />-Well...
6362429 6363898 My son likes football.
6366601 6367735 Is that so?
6367802 6368836 [Knox] Yeah.
6371038 6373507 Sometimes we go<br />to the Rose Bowl.
6378212 6379747 I bet he loves that.
6379814 6381549 -[Knox] Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
6383317 6384552 But...
6386486 6387722 [sobs]
6391759 6393527 [sighs]
6393594 6394862 [Knox muttering] Sunday...
6397430 6398666 I love you, Dad.
6407041 6408075 Yeah.
6467401 6468703 [unintelligible conversation]
6468769 6470037 [Kaylee giggling]
6479914 6482482 -[Miles] Who wants to get beat?<br />-I don't know it.
