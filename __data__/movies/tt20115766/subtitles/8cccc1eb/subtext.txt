137721 140015 - Cassie, can I have some coffee?<br />- Okay.
143477 145437 You heard about this broad<br />out in West Lake?
147244 149274 Old-school, newspaper, I like it.
150192 153487 Yeah. You know, the news does come<br />on your phone now. It's a new thing.
153570 155656 Says the man with 10,000 books.
157068 158033 Thank you.
158116 160619 Makes her husband breakfast for 35 years.
161453 165791 One day, she starts putting a little bit<br />of antifreeze in his orange juice,
165874 167167 every morning.
167250 168627 Why, was he cold?
170837 172297 What we got here?
175092 177636 "Empiricism<br />and the Philosophy of the Mind."
178437 179680 What a crook.
182182 183809 Wilfrid Sellars write this?
183892 187521 Yeah, interesting guy.<br />You know Wilfrid Sellars?
187604 189147 No, but I know Peter Sellars.
190152 191027 Okay.
193985 196530 It took this guy eight months<br />to die from the antifreeze.
197489 199074 That's dedication.
199658 201743 I mean, you gotta<br />give her points for tenacity.
201827 203453 Come on. Eight months?
204329 206581 Can you imagine hating anyone that much?
206665 209876 Honestly?<br />I can think of a few candidates, yeah.
209960 211044 How'd they catch her?
211753 212868 Doesn't say.
213296 214548 Maybe they...
215799 218885 Maybe when they tried to embalm the guy,<br />the formaldehyde wouldn't set.
219845 223682 "I pumped two barrels of that shit<br />into him, it keeps leaking out."
224182 226017 Put him in the deep freeze,<br />and he's still warm.
227452 229271 That's good, that's good.
229354 232399 - Thank you.<br />- Hi there, Cassie.
232482 234151 Hey, Cassie, can I get a coffee?
235110 236653 I already gotcha.
237612 239156 I guess I need it.
243994 245746 You're such a skinny dude.
245829 246872 Where you put all that?
248290 250834 My old man said I have a hollow cock.
252026 252878 Really?
252961 255881 Your father said that, "hollow cock."<br />Interesting.
255964 258258 Yeah, he's a philosopher too.
264389 266391 I'm gonna go<br />right to the airport from here.
267350 269728 I have to go out of town<br />for a couple of days.
269811 271480 - You? What for?<br />- Yeah.
271563 273565 Personal stuff, no big deal.
273648 276693 I'll be back day after tomorrow.<br />Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.
277944 279279 - Personal?<br />- Yeah.
280238 281239 Good.
281782 284159 'Cause if Jericho found out<br />you went out of town on a job--
284242 286328 Give me a little credit.<br />I don't have a death wish.
286411 287871 Then why are you even going?
287954 289873 Like I said, personal.
290415 291416 No big deal.
292000 293376 I'll be back tomorrow.
294586 295921 - Okay.<br />- Yeah.
307307 308308 You okay?
309643 310644 Good.
311645 312646 Okay.
314481 315565 I'm gonna get a check.
315649 318151 The check? We just got the plate of food.
318235 321279 I know, but I don't wanna be late.<br />I have to get to the airport.
321363 323406 You got five minutes to eat some food.
323490 326076 - Hurry up. Take five minutes.<br />- Jesus Christ.
328954 330997 All right. Anything comes up, call me.
332290 333291 What the hell?
333792 335210 When did you get the new car?
341675 344553 So-- So, you're not even gonna tell me<br />where you're going now?
344636 345846 Tell you when I come back.
353144 354145 Apple.
357148 358358 Dog.
374708 375709 Car.
412078 413288 How are you today?
414331 416708 Well, you tell me.
417208 420295 My initial suspicions were incorrect.
421546 423048 It's not Alzheimer's.
425008 426009 Okay.
427552 428803 What is it?
428887 431932 You're suffering from a condition<br />known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
432015 434809 It presents initially<br />in much the same way as Alzheimer's.
435644 437020 So, what's the difference?
437103 438355 Speed of progression.
441399 444653 I'm guessing you don't mean it's slower.
447364 449240 In your case, it's incredibly fast.
454704 455705 What's the treatment?
456373 457540 There is no treatment.
460752 463254 The thing you have to remember<br />about dementia
464130 466716 is the thought-feeling connection.
466800 469094 You have a thought, creates a feeling.
469177 472013 You lose a thought,<br />you're left with a feeling.
472097 475141 So, you'll be going along and...
475266 478520 all of a sudden, you'll be<br />unreasonably happy and you won't know why.
479479 484109 Or you'll have this wave of depression<br />and you won't know why.
484609 488363 You'll find yourself...<br />forgetting people,
488446 491032 even those you have a connection with.
491616 495328 You'll become...<br />displaced in time and space...
503253 504504 Right now, you're mostly lucid
504587 508008 with small patches of confusion<br />and mental lapse.
508091 509592 Soon that'll reverse.
509676 511886 The moments of lucidity<br />will become the exception
511970 513680 and eventually go away altogether.
514431 515682 How much time do I have?
515765 518727 It's progressing more aggressively<br />than I would like.
518810 520020 How much time?
521938 525817 You're looking at weeks, not months.
526985 528486 If you have any arrangements to make,
528570 530739 I suggest you do so<br />as quickly as possible.
532407 534451 Do you have family<br />that can take care of you?
537787 539539 - None that would.<br />- All right.
540794 543752 Then I suggest you<br />look into care facilities.
546880 549090 This is a very good place...
550383 551593 in your area.
561895 562937 I'm sorry.
563438 564939 That's okay, doc.
566316 568359 Even if I hated you for telling me,
569194 570653 I'd forget soon enough.
593968 596179 - ...last time.<br />- What do you want to know?
596871 599641 I think you have secrets<br />you don't want to tell me.
599724 602268 Secrets stay secrets,<br />so I can't tell you.
605188 607232 I finished the last book you lent me.
607315 608858 Oh, yeah?
609609 610610 What did you think?
612821 614739 I like it but the end was stupid.
615448 616449 Really?
617992 621579 He just lets them chop off his head<br />while the other guy walks away?
621663 628294 Well, see, his whole character arc<br />leads to that moment.
628378 632924 You know? It's a...<br />sacrifice for the greater good, you know?
634311 635802 Like the end of <i>Casablanca</i>?
635885 637804 Yeah, like the end of <i>Casablanca</i>, exactly.
637887 639472 It was bullshit too.
640306 642517 Rick would take the girl<br />ten times out of ten.
642600 644894 "A far, far better thing" my ass.
648106 650316 Is everyone from Kraków that cynical?
650400 652735 I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.
655822 656906 What day is it?
658199 660577 - Thursday?<br />- No, no, no. I mean--
660660 661953 I mean what date.
662036 663580 The 5th, does that mean something?
665790 667083 It's my son's birthday.
668543 672172 Who hasn't spoken with me,<br />many, many years.
676801 678511 Why does he hate you so much?
679971 684684 I'm what the science journals<br />refer to as a "lousy father."
686644 688688 Then he found out what I did for a living.
689230 690231 Yeah?
690315 691941 - Yeah.<br />- What do you do for a living?
692442 693610 I work for the IRS.
693693 695695 Just like that, I hate you too.
697780 701784 I've been coming here<br />once a week for almost four years
702285 705079 and that's the first human thing<br />you've ever said about yourself.
706039 708958 What do you want to know?<br />I'll tell you anything, just ask me.
709459 711377 Is that your real name, Aristotle?
711920 716174 No, it's a nickname<br />the guys in my platoon gave me.
716257 719093 I was in the first Gulf War<br />and I used to read a lot of books,
719177 721638 like philosophy, and like that.
728978 730647 I gotta go.
742200 744494 Thing with your son explain a lot, though.
746120 747163 What do you mean?
747830 750875 You know how they say<br />haunted houses have cold spots?
752919 757423 Stand in certain areas and a chill goes<br />down your spine like an arctic breeze.
757507 758800 What the hell are you talking about?
758883 761803 That's what it's like here.<br />You walk in the door and you feel it.
762428 763888 Only, it isn't a ghost.
764514 765473 What is it?
766474 767809 Loneliness.
769852 772689 See you next Thursday,<br />"not really Aristotle."
777193 779362 <i>- This guy's a piece of work.<br />- I don't care.</i>
779445 781281 Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>
781406 784492 - Why do we always have to go through this?<br />- Why do we have to go through what?
784575 786661 You ask me if I want to know<br />the details of the job,
786744 789539 I say, "No, I really don't," and then<br />you tell me the details of the job,
789622 791916 and I say, "Shut up,"<br />and we go through it again and again,
792000 794210 and we always go through<br />the same thing every fucking time!
794294 797547 The question is,<br />why don't you care who the guy is?
797630 798631 Get ready.
802427 803428 Hey.
804387 806431 This could be my last job for a while.
807682 809225 - What the fuck is going on, John?<br />- Nothing.
809309 812270 I just need to take care of a few things.<br />I'll clear it with Jericho.
812353 813980 Okay, how long are you going to be out?
815648 816649 Hard to say.
817984 819777 Come on. Let's go.
819861 822530 This motherfucker sells men<br />for human labor, that's a thing now.
822613 825491 - I thought trafficking was like sex shit.<br />- Jesus Christ. Same thing every time.
825575 826576 This motherfucker--
826659 828286 Didn't we just go through this at the car?
830288 832415 Why don't you care who the guy is?
833291 836794 Because in ten minutes, Tommy,<br />he's not gonna be anybody.
838046 839297 Let's go get this done.
903903 906906 <i>My car broke down<br />and I really needed a ride.</i>
938521 939439 Damn it.
1004086 1005505 Hello?
1006964 1008090 Yeah.
1009331 1010718 Well, we were
1011219 1013137 expecting only one person to be there.
1013221 1015598 Then, we got split up.
1016807 1020770 I guess he figured, I don't know,<br />we could cover more ground.
1022271 1025024 And I heard shots...
1029445 1030780 Christ, Tommy.
1034367 1035576 I didn't mean to.
1039789 1042333 - Knox.<br />- I'm sorry, Tommy.
1051676 1053010 Yeah, he was.
1055054 1059225 <i>Yeah. I made sure the scene<br />was clean and then I left.</i>
1065398 1066566 Okay.
1067608 1068526 Thank you.
1086043 1087128 You buying this?
1087878 1089589 Five bullets, three victims?
1090131 1091465 Had to happen fast.
1092800 1096137 Are you thinking there's a third shooter?<br />There's no evidence of that.
1099473 1101058 Growing up, I hated my mother.
1102393 1103686 That right?
1103769 1107356 She was a stereotype.<br />Overbearing, Asian, helicopter mom.
1108149 1109984 An A-minus meant I didn't have any pride.
1110067 1111819 My mother was a drunk, so...
1111902 1113404 - This is about me.<br />- Sorry.
1113487 1117992 She hates my chosen profession but,<br />ironically, made me a good detective.
1119869 1122830 Realizing her wanting me to excel<br />was about her and not me...
1124165 1125791 ...gave me my first lesson in motive.
1125875 1128336 She taught me that the details<br />were important.
1129003 1131797 The answers lie<br />in the little things other people--
1131881 1133424 She meant white people-- overlook.
1133507 1136135 With all due respect,<br />is this going somewhere?
1136218 1138262 There's water all over the floor.
1138346 1141140 That means the shower was on<br />when the curtain came down.
1141223 1142391 Okay.
1143851 1145603 - So?<br />- So,
1145686 1148232 he killed them, they killed him,<br />all in a hurry.
1151067 1152360 Who turned off the shower?
1193859 1195820 - Hey, Knox.<br />- Hey.
1196320 1197947 Sit down. Want a drink?
1198030 1199740 Yeah. Yeah, whiskey.
1201659 1202660 So,
1204036 1206455 you just swing by to say hello?
1207289 1209125 Nah, closing out.
1209208 1211168 I have to do it pretty quick too.
1211669 1213295 - Quick?<br />- Yeah.
1213379 1215673 - Jericho know?<br />- He can't.
1216394 1217925 That makes it tough.
1218426 1219927 Raise your commission, I guess.
1221804 1222847 I'm...
1224038 1225328 I'm going away.
1226142 1227143 For good this time.
1228185 1230229 And I don't want this<br />blowing back on Jericho.
1230813 1231981 What happened?
1232064 1233274 Job went south.
1233357 1236277 I set the scene up<br />to buy myself some time but...
1237528 1239989 - It's not gonna last long.<br />- You sure about that?
1240573 1241615 Three people.
1242616 1244326 All shot each other with the same gun.
1245494 1246787 Yeah, that's not good.
1248372 1249415 My gun.
1249915 1251751 - That's worse.<br />- Yeah.
1252752 1255629 So time is of the essence.<br />How do you have your capital?
1255713 1260009 Mostly cash. Got some paintings<br />you gotta sell. Some stones.
1260092 1262636 - That's simple enough.<br />- Yeah.
1266557 1267767 List of three people.
1268350 1269977 All three, equal shares.
1270478 1272104 Nothing in here for Muncie's family?
1273189 1274607 Muncie didn't have anybody.
1276275 1279862 I can't have any of this<br />touch those people.
1279945 1281155 This money has to be clean.
1284617 1287453 Gather your assets, I'll set it up.
1288078 1291040 - A couple days.<br />- Hey, this stays between you and me.
1291123 1293167 Yeah, and I'm gonna tell who?
1295085 1296086 Right.
1297004 1298214 All right, thanks.
1326909 1329537 - What's up?<br />- This key does-- doesn't work in the...
1331205 1332998 - You know, the thing, the--<br />- Lock?
1333082 1335543 - Lock, yeah.<br />- All right.
1335626 1338546 Yeah, the green ones, they go<br />to our other facility, out in Van Nuys.
1338629 1340506 Okay. Okay.
1341632 1343133 Hey, could you do me a favor?
1343217 1346011 Could you write down the number--
1346095 1347471 The address? The address.
1347555 1348764 - Yeah, gotcha.<br />- Yeah.
1398972 1401483 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to<br />just to show up like this.
1401567 1402776 I should have called.
1402860 1405070 I didn't mean to ambush you. I'm sorry.
1406864 1407907 Do I know you?
1411201 1413454 Okay, I guess I-- I deserve that.
1414496 1417499 You got to know I wouldn't be here<br />unless I was desperate.
1418375 1420461 Okay? I need your help.
1423297 1425841 Dad, could you just--<br />Please just talk to me?
1426383 1427384 Dad.
1428928 1430638 Miles. Yeah.
1432264 1434516 Sure, Miles. Come here. Come on in.
1436039 1437594 Thank you, I just...
1439730 1440981 Have a seat.
1452534 1456538 No, no, no, I'm-- I'm sober. Nine years.
1463921 1464964 That's your blood?
1466982 1468968 Yeah, my hand is...
1470010 1471804 I cut it in a...
1473222 1475849 This is my blood,<br />and that's someone else's.
1475933 1477977 Holy fuck!
1483482 1484817 I fucked up.
1486819 1488654 I fucked up really bad.
1489571 1491198 Okay. Okay.
1491782 1493534 Okay, take it-- take it easy.
1495202 1496203 Catch your breath.
1498122 1499415 Tell me what happened.
1502584 1504169 I killed someone.
1506213 1507381 Did they deserve killing?
1511719 1513846 Okay, start there.
1515597 1517099 Okay.
1519101 1520394 You have a granddaughter.
1520894 1522021 Kaylee.
1523477 1524690 How did you know about her?
1524773 1527067 Your mother told me,<br />right after she was born.
1529278 1531655 - Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.<br />- Yeah.
1531739 1534366 What is she, like, 12, 13?
1535075 1536326 She's 16.
1537357 1538817 Here.
1543667 1545252 - Cute kid.<br />- Yeah.
1546420 1547421 She's a kid.
1550424 1552009 And she met this guy.
1553552 1556597 Online. This piece of shit!
1558015 1559767 Guy was 32 years old.
1559850 1563520 This son of a bitch gets her pregnant.
1564396 1566815 She's 16 years old, she's my little girl.
1567316 1572780 So, I go over to his house, you know?<br />I'm just gonna put the fear of God in him.
1574198 1576151 And I show up and he's...
1577951 1580704 ...more than I expected. Okay?
1582956 1585667 He wouldn't shut up. Just kept talking,
1585751 1589088 and talking and talking<br />about my fucking daughter.
1589171 1593175 Like, saying shit about her, like,<br />"She loves it," "She wanted more."
1593258 1596303 Called her "ripe." Called her ripe, Dad!
1598007 1599932 Fuck! I just lost it.
1601350 1603852 So I grabbed a knife and I sh--
1604770 1606480 I shoved it into his neck.
1609483 1611193 And I stabbed him.
1612194 1613904 I just couldn't stop.
1617366 1618534 I didn't care.
1620160 1622329 'Cause I wasn't even in the room, I was...
1630587 1631797 Did you bury this guy?
1633006 1634007 Did I bury him?
1634591 1635592 Yeah.
1636468 1637970 No, why?
1638053 1641140 Because if you did,<br />I was gonna dig him up and kill him again.
1647813 1649231 Oh, my God.
1650899 1652025 So, why'd you come to me?
1656405 1657615 Are you kidding?
1659825 1661118 Well, I mean, I--
1662369 1665914 You're the only person I know that can--<br />I-- This isn't my world.
1666707 1667708 I--
1667791 1669710 - I don't know how to--<br />- Get rid of a body.
1671587 1673422 I never asked you for anything in my life.
1675007 1679428 Okay? I'm here<br />because I had nowhere else to go.
1680012 1681180 Now you need me.
1681889 1685017 Yes. That's what this is.<br />I'm desperate, okay?
1685100 1688520 I'm so fucking desperate that I'm here,<br />at your house, asking you for help.
1688604 1690564 Now, are you gonna help me or not?
1701533 1702743 Where's the murder weapon?
1729019 1730437 Here.
1730520 1732231 Put your clothes in that plastic bag,
1732314 1734608 then take a shower<br />and scrub down everything.
1734691 1736818 Underneath the fingernails,<br />clean everything.
1736902 1739571 Then, afterwards, I'm gonna wrap<br />and clean that hand of yours.
1740447 1742658 - Then what?<br />- Then?
1742741 1745619 You go home to your wife<br />and you never mention this again.
1747871 1749873 My whole life,<br />I never asked you for anything.
1749957 1751917 Yeah, you said that already.
1753335 1756964 Here, use that.<br />I'm gonna need those boxers too.
1762594 1764680 Hey, where's the body?
1837127 1839504 Write it down. Write it down.
2064521 2065730 There you are.
2068066 2069818 What are you doing?
2071278 2072445 Nothing.
2075824 2077200 I talked to her.
2079160 2080495 What'd she say?
2082872 2084332 She wants you to take her.
2085125 2086209 What?
2087752 2092215 Well, I assumed this would be,<br />you know, like, a mother-daughter thing.
2092299 2094342 Well, apparently it isn't.
2096386 2097887 What happened to your hand?
2106730 2108857 I have to tell you something.
2118158 2119909 All right, what do we got?
2119993 2122537 Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.
2122621 2126166 We're waiting for the Interpol jacket,<br />but safe to say he wasn't a model citizen.
2126916 2129377 The woman was local, Annette Elmora.
2129461 2131755 Yeah, we're thinking maybe<br />he picked her up at a club or something.
2131838 2134674 You know, wrong place,<br />wrong time kind of thing.
2134758 2136885 Victim number three<br />is where it gets interesting.
2136968 2139929 Meet Thomas Muncie,<br />suspected hitter for Jericho.
2140013 2144225 Conspicuously missing from the carnage,<br />this man, John Knox.
2144976 2148396 Traffic cam shot this six blocks away<br />around the time of death.
2148480 2149856 Facial recognition flagged him.
2149939 2152859 - That could just be a driver, though.<br />- We sure this guy reads driver?
2153360 2154569 What's his jacket say?
2154653 2157447 Not much. He did a six-year stretch<br />for tax evasion,
2157530 2159240 and that's only because<br />someone ratted him out.
2159324 2162702 Other than that and his service record,<br />there's nothing on him.
2162786 2165997 Which means, whatever this guy does<br />for a living, he's pretty good at it.
2166081 2171336 Smart, too. According to the tax auditor's<br />notes, John Knox holds two PhDs.
2171419 2174214 One in English Lit and one in US History.
2175048 2176716 Even taught at Bucknell a couple of years.
2176800 2179511 And we're thinking maybe<br />this guy kills people for a living?
2180053 2181054 Why?
2181137 2183181 Hopefully, we'll get to ask him ourselves.
2183264 2185141 What branch of service was he in?
2185225 2187852 Army.<br />He was a deep reconnaissance officer.
2188937 2190563 Remind me what that is again?
2191064 2194442 Someone who goes off alone<br />behind enemy lines for weeks at a time.
2194526 2197404 Well, maybe we just bring him in<br />as a cooperating witness.
2197487 2199739 Friend-of-the-victim kind of thing.
2199823 2201282 He might slip up and give us something.
2201950 2203785 This seem like someone who makes mistakes?
2203868 2206162 Hey, boss, check your texts.
2210667 2213837 Another body. And now,<br />we got three on my board already.
2213920 2215422 Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.
2216047 2217966 That is your métier.
2218466 2220260 Métier? Really?
2228727 2230228 - John Knox.<br />- Hey!
2230311 2231229 - Hi.<br />- Is he upstairs?
2231312 2234023 <i>Da</i>, I'm supposed to think<br />he's doing the books.
2234107 2236401 - What's he really doing?<br />- Watching TV.
2236484 2238611 - I married a little boy.<br />- Yeah.
2238695 2240864 Well, he married up, that's for sure.
2245869 2248371 Xavier! Coming up.
2250707 2254210 <i>We already know<br />that lions are big cats.</i>
2254294 2259048 <i>Weighing up to 500 pounds,<br />growing up to ten feet long.</i>
2259132 2260884 <i>Lions are the second largest...</i>
2260967 2263136 Look at this skinny son of a bitch.
2263219 2266681 They rescued him from a big cat sanctuary.
2267265 2271686 Locals tossing stray dogs in the cages<br />so he can have something to eat.
2272395 2273813 Kinda reminds me of you.
2274731 2276858 You know,<br />when I first found you after your war.
2278693 2280069 I never ate a dog.
2281571 2284282 What's this, grocery list?
2284866 2287285 It's a plan, and I'm gonna need your help.
2287368 2288411 Just read it.
2292207 2293917 Hey, Ludmilla looks good.
2295168 2301132 Nah. She still hasn't realized<br />what a mistake she made marrying me.
2301216 2302759 You're learning any Russian?
2303468 2306888 Just the stuff she says I need to know,<br />you know, like,
2306971 2309474 "Yes, dear." "Please."
2309557 2310725 All the essentials.
2314521 2316272 Okay, lay it on me.
2318149 2320360 Stabbed at least 17 times.
2322070 2324864 I put time of death between<br />3:00 and 8:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon.
2324948 2327367 I'll get a more precise time frame<br />when I get him to the shop.
2327450 2328701 - All right.<br />- Yeah.
2329828 2330870 Thanks, bud.
2331913 2333331 There's no murder weapon yet,
2334040 2336459 but there is a knife missing<br />from that kitchen block.
2337001 2338837 I mean, it doesn't even look<br />like anything was stolen.
2338920 2342715 He's got an expensive watch on his wrist,<br />he's got a wallet full of large bills...
2343216 2346261 I know this racist piece of crap.<br />Name is Andrew Palmer.
2347053 2350473 He moves cash around<br />for the Aryan Brotherhood but he's a cog.
2350557 2353226 - Not a shot caller.<br />- So, he winds up dead.
2353309 2354394 There's no big mystery there.
2354477 2358022 Maybe. But he also did a stretch<br />a few years back for kiddie porn.
2358898 2361985 And this--<br />This doesn't look like business.
2362068 2363444 This looks personal.
2363528 2366614 Detective, gate guard out front<br />says he was knocked out last night.
2368116 2369409 I got this.
2370839 2372412 Bag the victim's computers,
2372495 2373788 any flash drives and discs.
2373872 2376374 - What are we looking for?<br />- You'll know when you see it.
2376917 2379294 And see if you can find his phone,<br />he didn't have it on him.
2379377 2380670 Got it.
2386968 2388511 So, how long have you known?
2389707 2390972 Not long.
2392181 2394684 Doc says this thing moves pretty fast.
2395087 2396811 Jesus, Knox.
2397395 2399397 I can't think of anything worse.
2400064 2402108 Except maybe your pecker stops working.
2402191 2407155 Actually, I'm looking forward<br />to forgetting some things.
2408364 2412785 Muncie. Christ. I can't imagine what the--
2413369 2415038 That's like me shooting you.
2415121 2417415 I don't even remember doing it.<br />I mean, I know--
2417498 2421044 I know I did it but I have<br />no recollection of the event.
2421127 2423046 Well, count your blessings.
2424130 2427842 - This is a radical plan.<br />- It's the only way I can figure it.
2429302 2432388 This kid's DNA is all over the place.
2432472 2436059 He actually bled on the guy,<br />he's got his fingerprints everywhere.
2436142 2439020 He might as well just<br />signed off on the job.
2439103 2440855 Still, you don't pull this off,
2440939 2443733 - you are both fucked.<br />- Yeah.
2445193 2447654 - I'm fucked either way.<br />- That's true.
2447737 2449822 That's why I'm asking you to help me.
2450531 2453076 Look, just check in with me.
2453159 2455662 Just check in with me<br />now and then. You know?
2455745 2458456 - Make sure I'm on point.<br />- Yeah, of course, sure.
2459082 2463878 Just so you don't ever think<br />that this stupid plan is my idea.
2464420 2465964 I'm sure you'll remind me.
2468132 2469842 You want to know the funny thing?
2469926 2471678 Let's say I pull this thing off,
2472387 2474764 I won't even know if I did it or not.
2474847 2477016 It is encouraging.
2477100 2479602 This plan is precision work, man.
2479686 2481896 - One hair out of place--<br />- I know.
2483690 2485066 I know.
2485650 2487735 I know I could pull this off.
2487819 2489153 The question is, can you?
2490530 2493408 So, you didn't see his face,<br />didn't see his height, nothing?
2493491 2494534 - No.<br />- Okay.
2494617 2495994 All right, thank you.
2499122 2500164 Beautiful day.
2500248 2501249 Sure.
2502083 2504168 What did you get?<br />Don't suppose he can ID our killer.
2504252 2505712 No, he was attacked from behind.
2506295 2509799 He didn't see anything. Happened<br />a little before three in the morning.
2509882 2512844 Doesn't fit the timeline.<br />ME said he was killed before 8:00 p.m.
2513428 2515763 So you think the attack<br />on the guard was unrelated?
2515847 2518349 It's related, I'm just not sure how, yet.
2518433 2520518 They get anything off<br />these security cameras?
2520601 2524439 Well, that part is weird. They feed<br />into a DVR in the utility closet.
2524522 2527066 - There's no hard drive.<br />- You mean it doesn't work?
2527150 2528985 No, I mean the tech couldn't get playback
2529068 2531654 so we opened up the DVR<br />and looked inside, no hard drive.
2532230 2533691 Found his phone.
2533990 2536743 Can't open it, though. It's got one of<br />those facial recognition locks on it.
2536826 2538911 - Okay, head back inside.<br />- Okay.
2540449 2543833 - What am I looking for?<br />- His face. I assume that's where it is.
2545251 2546335 Right.
2604393 2605728 Did you forget I was coming?
2607805 2608825 No, no.
2617156 2618241 How are you?
2621536 2625248 Good. I'm kind of knotted up.
2626165 2627875 That's why I'm here.
2630711 2632004 I finished the book.
2632922 2636592 It was better,<br />but I knew he was going to die in the end.
2636676 2638052 He kind of had to.
2638553 2640138 I'll find you another one here.
2644142 2645393 This is your ex?
2647770 2648771 Yeah.
2649772 2652150 - Well, she's gorgeous.<br />- Yeah.
2653401 2654721 Hey...
2656988 2659574 ...put that down--
2661242 2662743 Why don't I get ready?
2668416 2669625 Fuck me.
2689312 2692273 - These paintings are all real?<br />- Yeah.
2693399 2695943 - It's safer than cash.<br />- Are they worth a lot?
2697028 2700823 - Why do you have them?<br />- Part of my cashing-out process.
2700907 2702200 What?
2705369 2708831 - What do you mean "cashing out"?<br />- Forget I said it. Forget it.
2710499 2711834 You find me something?
2716214 2719383 Hello? You picked me another book?
2721385 2722553 You want a book?
2722637 2726387 Knox, are you having<br />a stroke or something?
2726807 2729852 - Maybe you should sit down?<br />- You know what? Maybe...
2731938 2733522 Maybe it's better if you just go.
2736359 2737401 Good idea.
2767765 2768849 Sorry.
2769558 2772603 I just got a-- Got a thing I got to do.
2773562 2776774 - Same time next week?<br />- Yeah.
2778109 2779694 Yeah, you bet, next week.
2779777 2781570 Are you sure you're going to be okay?
2781654 2782905 Never better.
2820192 2821402 Here.
2822737 2824030 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
2824909 2827074 We have an appointment.<br />Last name's Knox.
2827158 2829535 Okay. All right, here it is.
2829618 2831662 You must be Kaylee. And you are?
2831746 2834790 I'm the father. Her father, not the...
2834874 2836167 - I'm her dad.<br />- Okay, Dad.
2836834 2839420 See, sign here.<br />Initial here, here and here.
2840212 2843758 Before we do the procedure, the law says<br />that we have to ask you a few questions.
2843841 2846302 Not about the father of your child<br />or anything like that,
2846385 2849764 just to make sure that you really want<br />to be here. That be okay?
2850806 2851932 I guess so.
2852600 2853726 Good.
2854727 2856729 Now it's your turn.
2857313 2861192 I need a couple of signatures from you,<br />starting here on the consent form.
2868199 2870659 - All right, guys, have a seat.<br />- Thank you.
2877750 2881504 <i>Are you having a stroke or something?</i>
2893516 2894683 Xavier, hey.
2894767 2897311 I'm calling to make sure you're on track.
2897395 2900981 - On track with what?<br />- Your cockamamie plan is what.
2901899 2903317 You got your notepad?
2904360 2905403 Yeah.
2907363 2909573 Yeah, I'm on track. Don't worry about it.
2909657 2911033 He says, "Don't worry."
2911826 2914453 Do me a favor, unlock your phone.
2915246 2917581 <i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>
2917665 2919667 <i>- Okay?</i><br />- Why?
2921001 2924463 Well, what if you need help<br />and you can't remember the code?
2925464 2927633 Right. Right, okay.
2928384 2929969 Yeah, got it.
2934557 2937393 - You there?<br />- Yeah.
2938727 2941272 Feel like I'm getting worse every hour.
2944775 2946318 I'm running out of time.
2946402 2950072 So, let's stop wasting it<br />talking to me. Okay?
3026815 3029068 What? I'm in the middle of dinner.
3030736 3032196 It's not even 4:30.
3032568 3035741 I'm almost 90.<br />Dinner time is very important to me.
3035824 3037243 What's up?
3037326 3039828 <i>Yeah, hey, I'm looking at<br />some kind of locker key.</i>
3039912 3041413 <i>Do you know where that's from?</i>
3041497 3043958 <i>You never confided in me<br />where you keep all your money.</i>
3044542 3046210 I am a crook, you know?
3046877 3049838 Yeah. All right. Great, thanks.<br />I'll figure it out.
3049922 3052967 Hey, wait a minute.<br />Did you take the passcode off your phone?
3053712 3055010 Yeah, I'm going to do that now.
3055761 3057596 I'll do it right now. Okay?
3057680 3060266 Thanks. Say hi to Becky from me.
3060808 3063018 - Wait, who?<br /><i>- Becky.</i>
3064561 3065811 Okay.
3066689 3068482 - All right.<br />- How's he doing?
3069275 3072403 - He just called you Becky.<br />- Who is this Becky?
3072486 3074196 She was one of my wives.
3074280 3077199 I divorced her before you were born, baby.
3077283 3080744 This business with Knox, it's not good.
3080828 3081912 No.
3082997 3084290 It's not.
3135591 3136675 Shit.
3196151 3198696 I ordered some food.<br />This place has great ribs.
3198779 3201073 I'm a vegan. Should we...
3203200 3206245 - Should we be meeting in public like this?<br />- No one knows us here.
3208372 3212543 - How's the hand?<br />- Well, it hurts.
3212626 3216130 If anyone asks you about it,<br />you cut it on a broken glass.
3216213 3218382 You were at my house.<br />We were having a drink.
3218465 3220509 What? Why would I be at your place?
3220592 3223512 You were looking for your old Hot Wheels,<br />make something up.
3227516 3229518 - How are you doing?<br />- How am I doing?
3229601 3230561 Yeah.
3232396 3236358 Spent the day at the abortion clinic<br />with my 16-year-old daughter,
3236442 3238569 so, bad, I guess.
3238652 3240195 Pretty bad.
3240279 3241655 Not sleeping, not eating.
3241739 3244032 - I haven't eaten since yesterday.<br />- Okay. Okay.
3245373 3247077 My hair is falling out.
3247373 3250038 So, I'm about to lose my goddamn mind.
3250122 3252791 Okay, okay. You need to get a grip.
3252875 3256378 I don't know how to do this.<br />I'm not-- I'm not like you, you know?
3258005 3259298 I'm not a killer.
3264344 3265596 You are, though.
3266764 3267765 What?
3268807 3270100 A killer.
3271602 3274229 Damn good one, too. Not half-assed.
3274772 3278442 I was out at the scene.<br />Let me put it to you this way:
3280235 3283947 that wasn't what you call<br />a proportional response.
3284698 3287117 - I lost it.<br />- Yeah. Understandable.
3287201 3290037 But now I need you<br />to pull it all together, okay?
3290704 3293373 - You're like a walking confession.<br />- I'll try harder.
3293457 3296084 No, do the opposite. Relax.
3297878 3298962 Okay.
3308555 3309681 Is she your only kid?
3312684 3318273 We-- We-- We lost one early on.<br />A miscarriage.
3319608 3321944 - Sorry, it's tough.<br />- Yeah.
3324112 3325697 Harder on Cheryl, actually.
3326698 3328116 What does she do, Cheryl?
3328992 3330452 Teaches fourth grade.
3331578 3332621 Public school.
3333372 3335833 Yeah. Yeah, the kids love her.
3337376 3339086 Nice. Boy, you guys are busy.
3340462 3342548 Working parents, on the go all the time.
3342631 3343882 What's the typical day?
3345509 3348804 Tomorrow for instance.<br />What would you do tomorrow?
3348887 3353433 We'd go get breakfast somewhere<br />and walk around Larchmont Village.
3353517 3355894 Unless Kaylee had soccer, then--
3355978 3358105 - Then we'd do that.<br />- Yeah. Do that.
3359481 3360816 - Just do that.<br />- Do that?
3360899 3364611 - Yeah.<br />- We can't. She's laid up in bed.
3364695 3367823 Don't vary your routine.<br />Do what you would normally do.
3387801 3388844 What happened to vegan?
3389553 3390888 Fuck it. I'm starving.
3391430 3393223 I've been starving for six years.
3394308 3398729 You-- You ever take the family<br />up to the cabin?
3398812 3400480 - The hunting cabin?<br />- Yeah.
3401940 3404401 I sold it, remember?<br />You signed the papers two years ago.
3407905 3409656 These are so fucking good.
3410240 3411658 Yeah.
3412409 3415621 I remember that. You know anything<br />about the-- about the owners?
3415704 3419458 I mean, they use it full time<br />or part time?
3419541 3421084 - The buyers?<br />- Yeah.
3422961 3426423 Well, I'm not renting it to them.<br />They-- I sold it to them.
3426506 3428425 They bought it, they own it. I have no...
3428508 3430344 - Right.<br />- Why would I know what they do?
3430427 3432012 Okay, listen to me.
3434139 3437809 You just need to...<br />hold it together, okay?
3437893 3440520 We're almost there. Couple more days.
3440604 3441688 Okay.
3443398 3444650 Look at me.
3448320 3450322 I need you to use my balls.
3451490 3452658 What?
3452741 3455661 They're gonna connect Kaylee<br />to the dead guy.
3455744 3457120 Then they're gonna question you.
3457204 3459915 If you don't think you have<br />the balls for it, use mine.
3459998 3463001 Do whatever you think<br />I would do if I was in that chair.
3464336 3465587 All right?
3465671 3466797 What?
3474054 3475764 I never hated you, you know?
3477599 3478725 Well...
3481144 3482896 Be understandable if you did.
3482980 3484731 You were a good dad in your way.
3486233 3487776 I remember a lot of good.
3489611 3490904 I remember the ball games.
3490988 3493949 I remember you teaching me how to hunt.
3495450 3498120 I remember you letting me<br />eat pancakes in the pool.
3501581 3503166 I worshipped you.
3504334 3506003 I wanted to be just like you.
3509047 3510882 Then, you know, I found out.
3513385 3514511 And I thought...
3518807 3520058 ...what if I did?
3525272 3526356 Did what?
3527441 3529109 What if I wound up just like you?
3534656 3535782 And here we are.
3540537 3541788 Yeah, here we are.
3583038 3585957 All right. Gelfuso, you're up.
3586041 3589336 Okay. Scene was definitely staged.
3589419 3592255 Ballistics says all three victims<br />killed with the same gun.
3592807 3594674 Didn't see that coming.<br />That's a fun one.
3595175 3596468 - They find the gun?<br />- Yeah.
3596551 3598845 It was the one in shower guy's hand.
3598929 3600388 Five shots total.
3600472 3603475 Only prints on the gun belong<br />to the dead Spaniard.
3604101 3606311 Anybody holding out<br />for a triple murder-suicide?
3606394 3607813 Yeah, it'd be a neat trick.
3607896 3609606 Specially the part where he reaches up
3609689 3611650 and turns off the shower<br />after he's already dead.
3611733 3613485 - Nice catch.<br />- Thank you.
3615278 3616446 What else?
3616530 3619116 I scoured every<br />surveillance camera in the area.
3619199 3621159 I can't put anyone<br />in the house with Muncie.
3621243 3623328 Least of all this John Knox character.
3623411 3624830 We know Knox's movements?
3624913 3627457 He hasn't used<br />his credit card since the murder.
3627541 3631920 Two days before them, he flies from<br />Burbank to San Francisco for 22 hours.
3632003 3633255 Why?
3633338 3634923 That part,<br />I haven't figured out yet.
3635006 3637217 But I got him on the return flight,<br />then he goes dark.
3637300 3639594 I think it's time we had a chat<br />with John Knox.
3640303 3642514 Go pick him up,<br />but bring him in voluntarily.
3642597 3644391 We got nothing to hold him as a suspect.
3644474 3645642 All right.
3806469 3808930 Do you know what electives<br />you're gonna take this year?
3809681 3811766 So, did you get your syllabus?
3811850 3814686 Yeah, I actually ended up<br />getting a class with Michelles.
3818940 3820900 I got a pick-up order for Anthony.
3829784 3831828 I just think that it might be<br />too much this year.
3831911 3833830 Thanks. Have a good one.
3834539 3836166 I'm still gonna do soccer. I think--
3836249 3837834 - Hey, excuse me.<br />- Yeah.
3837917 3839627 - I saw you looking at my daughter.<br />- Do I know you?
3839711 3841296 Hey! Oh, my God!
3841379 3843048 Fuck you!
3858063 3859564 John Knox?
3860315 3861566 Johnny Law.
3861649 3864819 We got something going on<br />we'd like to get your help with.
3864903 3867530 If you could come with us. Voluntarily.
3867614 3868740 Sure.
3868823 3870158 Why not? It's my day off.
3870241 3872535 I'll grab a jacket,<br />and I'll follow you down.
3872619 3874454 Or we could follow you down.
3875705 3877082 Better.
3882087 3885590 She's on my policy. I told you,<br />and I told the last person.
3886800 3888593 It was pre-approved.
3888676 3890303 Her doctor faxed it in.
3890387 3892430 You know, we go through the same fuck--
3893056 3894849 Damn thing every month.
3895487 3897352 Don't put me on hold.
3902399 3904484 We got Knox set up in Interview Two.
3907320 3909531 Anything on the other case? Palmer?
3910168 3912742 The prints we found don't match<br />anything in the system.
3912826 3915703 The ME confirmed that there were<br />two blood types on the scene
3915787 3919374 but hadn't had time to run DNA sequencing<br />to look for a match on the second guy.
3924379 3925839 It's always "guys" with you.
3928383 3930301 - You said "the second guy."<br />- Yeah.
3930385 3933972 You also said the gate card<br />was grabbed from behind by "the guy,"
3934055 3935932 even though he never saw his attacker.
3936015 3937267 It's always "guys" with you.
3937350 3940603 Fine. The ME has not had time<br />to run DNA sequencing
3940687 3943398 to look for a match<br />on the second them, they or their.
3943481 3945567 - Is that better?<br />- Welcome to the 21st century.
3945650 3947235 Oh, my God.
3958413 3960415 Detective. How can I help you?
3961374 3962709 Save it for the tape.
3965003 3970133 Detective Emily Ikari, interviewing<br />potential material witness, John Knox.
3970216 3973136 Case number 5-2-6-9-8.
3973928 3978099 Interview is voluntary.<br />Commencing at 10:46 a.m.
3979576 3981186 Please state your name for the record.
3981936 3983062 John Knox.
3983545 3985315 Full legal. Need the middle name.
3993448 3994616 It's not a trick question.
3994699 3996701 - Yeah.<br />- Those come later.
3997494 3998870 John Henry Knox.
4002290 4005585 Okay. I don't know<br />what game this is, but let's move on.
4007337 4011925 You said something about<br />me being a witness?
4012008 4015470 I hope so. I'm working<br />on the death of your partner.
4015553 4017388 - I don't have a partner.<br />- Not anymore.
4018598 4021684 If you're referring to Thomas Muncie,<br />he was an acquaintance.
4021768 4023394 We never did any work together.
4023478 4026231 I've been over the crime scene<br />a dozen times.
4026892 4028415 Let me tell you<br />what I think happened.
4028540 4029400 Sure.
4030151 4032654 There were three dead bodies in that room,
4032737 4034072 all shot with the same gun,
4034155 4036407 and staged to look<br />like they killed each other.
4037492 4039202 But it was clumsy.
4039911 4042330 Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.
4043164 4046626 I think someone killed Muncie by mistake
4047126 4049003 and tried to stage it to cover it up.
4052465 4054050 Did you say Ikari?
4055468 4057887 Are you related to Peter Ikari?
4060265 4062517 - That's my father.<br />- Oh, hell.
4063226 4064894 I know Pete.
4064978 4066646 Get him in here. I'll talk to him.
4066729 4068189 You know my father?
4068940 4072110 I just talked to him a couple days ago.
4072193 4074070 He used to patrol my neighborhood.
4075238 4077031 Mr. Knox, my father is dead.
4078908 4079993 What?
4082620 4083955 What happened?
4084038 4085957 He was shot in the line of duty.
4086040 4087166 Twelve years ago.
4089711 4091379 Where are you going with all this?
4099637 4100638 Look.
4102599 4104892 As far as the Muncie murder goes,
4104976 4106060 I wasn't there.
4106811 4109647 And if you had anything<br />to suggest that I was,
4109731 4112692 I'd be doing this interview<br />in a jumpsuit right now.
4112775 4114986 So, as far as you're concerned,
4115737 4117697 I'm Schrödinger's murderer.
4117780 4118865 Schrö-what now?
4119824 4120950 At this moment...
4123745 4127290 I both did and did not kill Muncie.
4128082 4130209 And with that, I'm gonna get going.
4130293 4131711 What's your hurry?
4132962 4135298 I'm gonna be going away soon.
4136132 4140553 And, before I do, there are<br />some things I better put right.
4140637 4143514 Interview suspended 10:52 a.m.
4146559 4148061 What in the fuck was that?
4148144 4149437 I don't know.
4149520 4151272 Strange fucking tactics.
4151356 4152690 So what's our next move?
4152774 4153775 Not sure.
4154609 4157153 How about we catch our other killer<br />while I mull it over?
4174087 4175296 "Walker."
4176881 4178633 Walker. John Walker.
4181344 4182428 Damn it.
4266971 4268055 Miles?
4299879 4301088 John?
4304258 4305593 What's with the chrome?
4305676 4307178 What? Are you gonna shoot me?
4307762 4309722 What the hell are you doing in my kitchen?
4310723 4312683 Can't believe the key is in the same spot.
4312767 4315102 - Let me get those groceries.<br />- No, no, no, no, no. No.
4315686 4317188 Don't touch the groceries.
4318439 4320066 What are you doing here?
4324320 4325404 I'm here.
4336207 4337250 Hey, I'm...
4340044 4341045 cashing out.
4342463 4345675 So there's gonna be-- gonna be<br />some money coming your way.
4346484 4348052 I don't want your money.
4350054 4352807 Let's-- Let's skip the part<br />where you pretend you don't
4352890 4355726 and I pretend to talk you into it.
4370366 4371826 Why are you cashing out?
4374036 4375162 Going away.
4377331 4378541 Of course you are.
4381794 4383588 I meant what I said about the money.
4384255 4386007 I never wanted anything from you
4387258 4388509 except for you.
4390720 4393389 But I guess we both knew<br />that was too much to ask.
4403900 4404984 Yeah.
4409405 4410701 So, anyway.
4413159 4415953 I need you to make sure<br />Miles takes his share.
4416829 4418063 That's--
4420416 4421542 That's harder.
4426130 4427715 Miles is harder.
4427798 4430852 Yeah. And have him...
4432803 4434263 So he can put...
4434831 4435765 The girl...
4436766 4437892 She can go--
4438643 4439769 Go to the...
4441854 4442939 you know.
4444908 4446025 Goddamn it.
4447360 4448486 The big school.
4449862 4451656 - College.<br />- Yeah.
4451739 4453176 Yeah...
4453616 4454700 Yeah.
4455534 4459497 I mean, you know, something good<br />has to come out of all this.
4459580 4461499 How long you going away for?
4462208 4464168 There's no coming back from this one.
4470925 4473386 - They finally caught up to you, huh?<br />- Yeah.
4473469 4475304 You must be slipping.
4476847 4478349 Yeah.
4479809 4481102 Yeah, you could say that.
4495408 4496742 So, anyway...
4498744 4500162 Yeah.
4500246 4501414 Okay.
4503290 4504417 All right.
4511549 4513050 Knox.
4514135 4516512 I still love you. Just a little.
4517888 4520766 And as much as I hate you,<br />I wouldn't want to shoot you...
4522476 4523894 so call ahead next time.
4525688 4526772 Yeah.
4528024 4529692 There isn't gonna be a next time.
4576847 4578574 <i>You must be slipping.</i>
4580242 4581410 Fuck.
4587369 4590461 <i>But I guess we both know<br />that was too much to ask.</i>
4597176 4598511 Knox.
4599432 4600244 Fucking...
4600503 4601305 John?
4601388 4603724 Sorry. Am I early?
4611232 4612566 No.
4613651 4616904 I was just gonna--<br />Why don't I jump in the shower?
4616987 4620407 Let's have a drink first.<br />I'll make you one for once.
4625704 4628332 I wasn't sure you'd want me here<br />after last time.
4628415 4630209 Why? What happened last time?
4634588 4636173 You got me worried, Knox.
4636257 4637299 Jesus, Ruby!
4637800 4638884 Don't worry about it.
4638968 4641679 I just gotta get a handle<br />on this last part of this thing.
4643013 4644765 How is the cash out coming?
4644849 4646559 I got the paintings and I got the cash,
4646642 4648602 I just have to get<br />the stones here tonight.
4648686 4649895 The stones?
4650688 4652273 Yeah, the stones.
4652356 4655609 And then I gotta take them to my guy.<br />He turns everything into clean cash.
4656485 4659780 Then I just have to cut it into thirds.
4659864 4660990 Why thirds?
4662074 4664451 Only got three people on the list.<br />You're on the list.
4668080 4670291 I don't even look like her, Knox.
4679508 4681552 Here's to every Thursday afternoon.
4706368 4707828 You just get a hand job?
4709705 4710789 Better.
4710873 4713292 You're not gonna believe<br />what Tech just found.
4713375 4714793 - So tell me.<br />- No!
4715544 4718172 No. You gotta hear this<br />for yourself. Come on!
4719798 4723594 Okay, everything we thought we'd find<br />based on his previous arrest record.
4723677 4724678 Oh, God.
4724762 4726847 But where it gets interesting<br />is in his live chats.
4726931 4729600 He was communicating<br />with half a dozen young teen girls.
4729683 4730893 Convincing them to send nudes.
4730976 4733312 We find the guy who killed this asshole,<br />we should give him a medal.
4733395 4735648 First we let him loose<br />on a few other guys I can think of.
4735731 4737149 It's always guys with you.
4737233 4739276 There's one girl he talked to<br />for over a year,
4739360 4741445 but then they actually started<br />to meet up IRL.
4741528 4743280 IRL?
4743364 4745199 In real life.
4745282 4746367 So say that.
4747743 4749536 They definitely had sex.
4750329 4752081 A lot of sex. They talk about it.
4752164 4753499 Extensively.
4753582 4754917 Anybody got a Tums?
4757753 4760631 Anyway, I was able to trace<br />her IP address.
4760714 4765010 She's a 16-year-old girl in Silver Lake<br />by the name of Kaylee Iris Knox.
4765094 4766387 Okay.
4766470 4768472 Let's talk to her and her parents.
4769515 4770766 Wait.
4770849 4772017 You say "Knox"?
4772601 4773811 I ran the family.
4774520 4776814 It's John Knox's granddaughter.
4885381 4888258 I'm sorry. Why do you want<br />to talk to our daughter?
4889485 4891720 We just have<br />a few questions for Kaylee.
4891804 4894556 And for your husband.<br />You guys are gonna be right in here.
4896998 4899728 Mr. Knox. Actually, we're gonna<br />put you in this room right over here.
4901230 4902398 Hang on a second.
4904566 4906944 Just be honest, okay? Tell the truth.
4911448 4914535 Detective Ikari is gonna be<br />right with you.
4994031 4996325 <i>Like, what if I did?</i>
5017638 5021016 Detective Emily Ikari,<br />interviewing Miles Knox. It is...
5022142 5023727 4:37 p.m.
5026104 5027356 Andrew Palmer.
5029483 5030484 What?
5031109 5032778 Pretty sure you know who he is.
5033362 5035447 I thought this was<br />about the fight at the café.
5035531 5037699 What fight at what café?
5041703 5042788 Okay.
5044039 5045791 What about that prick?
5045874 5047793 We know what happened between you.
5047876 5049211 You called them?
5049294 5051630 - You said you wouldn't call them.<br />- No, we didn't.
5051713 5053799 - No. You promised if I went to the clinic...<br />- Honey--
5053882 5055968 - ...you wouldn't tell on him.<br />- Kaylee, Kaylee.
5056051 5057761 Your parents didn't call us.
5057844 5059304 Neither your mom or your dad.
5059388 5061098 What's this about, then?<br />What do you want to know?
5061181 5064226 We found chats on his computer<br />between him and your daughter.
5064309 5067312 We're pretty sure we know what's going on.
5067396 5069106 We know that he raped you.
5071780 5073277 He didn't rape me.
5075904 5077531 Did you arrest him?
5077614 5080909 No. He--<br />He's not in any trouble with the law.
5080993 5083328 Well, if you're asking me if I want<br />to press charges, I don't wanna--
5083412 5084788 It's too late for that.
5084871 5085956 He's dead.
5090002 5091003 Good.
5092004 5094047 Was it an accident?<br />'Cause I hope he suffered.
5094673 5096008 I wanna show you something.
5100262 5101305 See that there?
5101388 5103265 That's your car.
5103348 5106101 Driving into the gated neighborhood<br />where Palmer lives.
5106643 5108437 This is about 20 minutes later.
5109187 5111523 You can see by the time stamp. See?
5112149 5114610 - That's you, no doubt.<br />- Yeah, that's me.
5115652 5117195 Yeah, I went to see him. So what?
5117863 5120198 So, somewhere in this time frame,
5120824 5122701 Palmer was stabbed to death<br />in his kitchen.
5123205 5125245 You can narrow the time of death<br />to 20 minutes?
5126371 5127456 Modern science.
5127539 5129499 This is the part where you tell me<br />you just went to warn him
5129583 5131043 to stay away from your daughter?
5131126 5132628 Yeah, that's exactly right.
5132711 5134087 And I might have punched him.
5136006 5137549 How did you cut your hand there?
5138342 5139343 On a glass.
5139426 5140927 We're gonna find that glass in your house?
5141011 5142471 No, I was at...
5143597 5145474 What do you mean at my house?
5145557 5149311 Based on this video, we obtained<br />a warrant for your house and your car.
5149394 5150687 They're being searched now.
5153982 5156068 I'm not gonna say another word<br />until my attorney gets here.
5156151 5158070 And that goes for my underage daughter.
5158153 5160572 Stop talking to her. Right now.
5172292 5173502 You all right?
5176505 5177714 Hey, man. Are you okay?
5183053 5184137 Yeah.
5184221 5185722 <i>We got you.</i>
5186390 5187391 Do you, now?
5187474 5188517 Don't say anything.
5189017 5190018 Sure.
5190102 5191561 I'll do the talking.
5192396 5193939 Show you what we found.
5198860 5202155 Your bloody clothes found<br />in a dumpster behind your apartment.
5202239 5203657 What? Bullshit.
5204574 5205742 The murder weapon
5206785 5209371 hidden in a heating vent<br />in your apartment.
5209454 5210664 No, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
5210747 5213166 - That's not right.<br />- Miles, stop talking.
5213250 5215460 The knife has prints all over it.
5215961 5218547 We'll be pulling yours for comparison<br />in about five minutes.
5218630 5220716 Me? I'm confident.
5222175 5225220 A long, blonde hair recovered<br />from the lapel of your coat.
5226096 5228014 What do you wanna bet<br />it matches the victim?
5228598 5230183 Don't speak.
5230267 5233854 Miles Knox, I'm arresting you<br />for the murder of Andrew Palmer.
5234521 5236189 You have the right to remain silent.
5236690 5239609 Anything you say can be held against you<br />in a court of law.
5240444 5242612 Here, a little coin for your trouble.
5242696 5244948 I'm good. I'm glad<br />you guys showed up.
5245031 5247159 - Take care of him.<br />- Thank you.
5249745 5252330 All kinds of people<br />make this world, don't they?
5256918 5258211 Okay, pal.
5259546 5261006 How are you even here?
5261757 5264134 I'm the last person you called, see?
5264676 5267304 Give Ludmilla your keys.<br />She'll drive your Caddy back.
5267387 5268805 I can drive my own car.
5268889 5271349 It's right around the corner.<br />Fifty meters away. Come.
5275061 5277814 - Hey, congrats on the arrest.<br />- Thanks.
5277898 5279941 I found out why<br />Knox went to San Francisco.
5280025 5281443 He was there to see a doctor.
5283063 5285572 Doctor Frederick Burns.
5286406 5288074 The-- The neurologist?
5288158 5289242 How do you know that?
5290786 5292996 Obviously,<br />I couldn't get any medical records,
5293079 5295248 but the guy specializes<br />in treating dementia.
5297042 5298627 Okay. Good work.
5299127 5300128 Thank you.
5302589 5305091 Did you at least get what you came for?
5307552 5309596 Yeah. Yeah.
5316686 5317771 Xavier,
5318647 5323318 I can only remember about<br />three hours of today.
5324319 5326112 It's like a curtain coming down.
5330033 5331409 That's rough.
5334120 5335205 Why me?
5336373 5337541 I mean, you know.
5338291 5340627 Trained killer and Army<br />and all that, I know,
5341378 5342879 but why'd you pull me in?
5345966 5347843 That brain of yours.
5349845 5352806 I knew you'd understand<br />the training I was putting you through.
5354432 5356408 You know, in all this time...
5357477 5360146 ...never left a print behind,<br />no DNA, nothing.
5362190 5363733 I learned from the master.
5364568 5366027 What's your count, anyway?
5366111 5367195 Two.
5367737 5368905 Two?
5370490 5371491 Come on.
5371575 5373660 That cabbie in Chicago
5374703 5376329 and a woman in the shower.
5379833 5382002 Two civilians. Fuck.
5383628 5384713 You know,
5385672 5386673 Muncie,
5388174 5390552 he liked to talk<br />about the targets, you know.
5390635 5393722 Pimps, drug dealers, traffickers.
5394848 5395974 Yeah.
5396933 5398351 I think it made him feel better.
5399936 5403607 He never got what it was really all about.
5404441 5405859 Which was?
5405942 5408069 Guys caught behind enemy lines.
5409195 5410196 That's all.
5414284 5415285 So,
5416161 5418330 we only have two steps left.
5419170 5420040 Right.
5420874 5423293 Your visit and my call.
5424002 5425337 Visit and a call.
5426713 5428590 Visit and the call. Visit and the call.
5429549 5430592 I can do that.
5430675 5432510 Keep the notes in your pocket.
5433762 5436848 I'll remind you when to go.
5438433 5440810 You'll be done tomorrow.
5445649 5446900 I'm scared.
5447525 5448818 Yeah.
5448902 5450070 I figured.
5466336 5467837 Hey,
5467921 5470548 I need you to do one more thing for me.
5470632 5472258 Finish my cash out.
5472342 5474094 Take my stuff to Philo.
5474177 5476429 You wanna put me in charge of your money?
5477138 5478682 You know I'm a thief.
5478765 5480266 You're not gonna steal from me.
5480350 5481226 No.
5482185 5483436 Probably not.
5483520 5485230 Wait here. I'll bring it out.
5485814 5487107 Okay, I'm here.
5560680 5562098 I'm sorry, Knox.
5562891 5564184 It's a lot of money.
5567479 5568730 Can't argue with that.
5572734 5574903 - Now what?<br />- Get the stones.
5578448 5580116 Easy, easy, easy.
5582786 5583953 A lot of them.
5599052 5600553 Where you going?
5645640 5646724 Knox...
5650520 5652564 How were you gonna split the take?
5653857 5655275 Four equal shares.
5658278 5659529 That's funny?
5659612 5660864 Yeah, it is.
5663491 5664993 You were gonna get a third.
5666244 5667370 What?
5668788 5670498 You were one of the three.
5671791 5673585 You're thinking of your ex-wife.
5673668 5674711 No, Annie.
5674794 5676212 It was you.
5678464 5682093 My Thursday afternoon date<br />for the last four years.
5683511 5686514 My ex-wife, my son,
5687432 5688516 and you.
5690476 5691644 All you had to do...
5693688 5694689 was nothing.
5708620 5710455 He wants to make a change to the list.
5710538 5712749 Take off the last name, the hooker.
5712832 5714209 No problemo.
5714292 5718171 You split it even, fifty-fifty,<br />between the wife and the son.
5718254 5719797 Carve out something for you?
5720381 5721799 No, I'm good.
5743655 5745323 What the hell, Dad?
5745406 5746783 I don't understand why you'd--
5746866 5749702 - Wait, wait, wait. Stop.<br />- I don't understand--
5749786 5751204 Stop. Just listen to me.
5751287 5752455 I'm so confused.
5753206 5754332 I went to you for help.
5754415 5756751 Why? Why would you do this to me?
5757794 5760338 You're the reason I went to prison.
5762215 5763299 I'm what?
5763383 5764717 The tax evasion thing.
5765301 5767887 You're the one who ratted me out.
5767971 5769806 What the-- I didn't know<br />anything about you back then.
5769889 5773226 I did six years because of you.
5773309 5776020 No, no. That's not true.
5776104 5778773 That's not true, Dad. Listen to me.<br />I think you're losing it.
5778856 5782110 Something's wrong with you. Why would--<br />Why would you think I would do that?
5782193 5783278 Look at me.
5784904 5786030 It was you.
5788283 5789367 You turned me in.
5789867 5792120 I did not! I didn't do that, Dad!
5792203 5795206 That's not true! Dad, listen to me!<br />Listen to me!
5795290 5796874 Dad! Goddamn it!
5797500 5798584 Listen to me!
5798668 5800628 Why would I do that even if I knew!
5801254 5802297 You're wrong!
5810930 5812307 - Hey, Ikari.<br />- What?
5812390 5814225 There's a problem<br />with the Palmer evidence.
5814309 5815685 - Which evidence?<br />- All of it.
5817353 5820273 So first, there was a problem<br />with the blood on the clothes.
5820356 5822066 Evidence of erythrolysis.
5822650 5824986 That's a molecular breakdown<br />consistent with freezing.
5825069 5829449 The blood on the clothes was<br />frozen for at least 12 hours
5829532 5831659 before it was thawed<br />and put on the fabric.
5832577 5833953 Put?
5834037 5835496 Yeah. Same with the knife.
5835580 5837123 Wait, that's not the murder weapon?
5837206 5839625 No, it definitely is,<br />and the blood is the victim's.
5839709 5841669 The issue is with the fingerprints.
5841753 5843004 No. I saw the comparison.
5843087 5845131 They matched Miles Knox's prints,<br />no question.
5845214 5847592 Yes, but they contained<br />traces of monomers.
5847675 5849802 Butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate.
5849886 5850928 Packing tape.
5851554 5853514 Also, some sort of household spice.
5854057 5857018 I'm sorry, Detective.<br />The prints on the knife were planted.
5857101 5858353 Planted?
5859354 5862732 - Christ.<br />- And then, there's the hair from the coat.
5862815 5865818 It's really impossible<br />that this was the only thing we found.
5865902 5867445 I've been over this three times.
5867528 5871282 In my opinion, this jacket was never<br />anywhere near the crime scene.
5871783 5873034 But we have the video.
5873618 5876329 Yeah, about that...
5876412 5877330 Fuck me!
5885421 5886714 Hey.
5887298 5888758 You're almost home.
5888841 5890301 One more step.
5890385 5891469 Okay.
5892762 5894305 <i>I'm gonna make the call.</i>
5894889 5895973 You just sit tight.
5897189 5899227 Did you get rid of the notebook?
5899310 5900228 Yeah, I did.
5900311 5904023 Because this all goes to hell<br />if they find your notebook.
5904107 5905233 You understand?
5905316 5907402 - It's gone.<br /><i>- What did you do with it?</i>
5907485 5908528 I burned it.
5908611 5909695 Okay.
5910530 5912490 I'll make the call, and it's over.
5912573 5914450 Yeah, good.
5914534 5916577 Hey, X...
5917578 5919038 You should...
5919455 5922792 probably tell her I've got<br />three dead bodies over here.
5922875 5925920 Do you have three dead bodies in there?
5926003 5927004 <i>I do.</i>
5927088 5928423 - Three?<br /><i>- Three.</i>
5931974 5932927 John.
5933010 5934095 Yeah.
5934846 5935930 Listen, I...
5940143 5941269 Good luck.
5945273 5947859 It's almost imperceptible<br />to the naked eye,
5947942 5949277 but there's a jump there.
5949777 5951946 And if you go into the root file,
5952029 5955283 someone clearly deleted<br />the original time stamp and wrote over it.
5955366 5957034 Hard to spot, but it's there.
5957118 5958119 Meaning what?
5958786 5962165 He could have driven in and out<br />of the gate on any day, at any time.
5962248 5964333 The footage was simply spliced in.
5969630 5971340 Miles Knox was framed?
5971424 5972717 That's what it looks like.
5972800 5975094 It doesn't add up. Nothing makes sense.
5976012 5976971 Detective Ikari.
5977054 5978347 - Not now.<br />- There's a phone call for you.
5978431 5979640 I said not now!
5979724 5983060 Okay, but this guy says<br />it has something to do with John Knox.
5984937 5986189 This is Detective Ikari.
5986272 5987773 <i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>
5988399 5989984 You should get up to his bungalow.
5990568 5991986 Why the hell would I do that?
5992487 5994947 <i>He's got three dead bodies in there.</i>
5995031 5996324 <i>Who is this?</i>
5997158 5999452 An anonymous, concerned citizen.
6011547 6012882 Don't move! Do not move!
6014634 6016177 Got a body.
6016260 6018137 What happened?
6019347 6020431 Jesus, Knox.
6020515 6022600 - Put your hands behind your back.<br />- All right.
6027480 6028481 Let's go.
6031108 6034529 Hey, hey! Ikari!<br />You're gonna want to check this out.
6045790 6046916 Why would he...
6047416 6048417 What the hell is this?
6049335 6050419 What?
6056592 6058010 Jesus Christ.
6060221 6061305 It was him.
6062515 6064350 My client won't be<br />making any statements.
6064433 6066227 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'll do the talking again.
6066811 6068145 You can wait outside.
6070398 6071899 So, Miles.
6073484 6075570 We know you didn't kill Andrew Palmer.
6077280 6078823 - What?<br />- You're in the clear.
6078906 6080449 We're dropping all the charges.
6080533 6082743 You'll walk out of here<br />in half an hour a free man.
6082827 6085746 But first, tell me again<br />how you cut your hand.
6087456 6088666 On a broken glass.
6089417 6090418 Where?
6091043 6092420 At my father's house.
6092503 6093796 Why were you there?
6093879 6095172 Don't say anything.
6103139 6105600 At least tell me about your dad.
6105683 6107268 In general terms.
6107351 6108477 - Don't.<br />- Wait.
6112148 6113357 In general terms?
6116277 6117695 A lousy jerk.
6118613 6119614 And a hothead?
6119697 6121699 Yeah, that's right.<br />He was abusive.
6122283 6124285 He's a despicable human being.
6124368 6125953 See, I get that.
6126037 6127997 But how big a prick do you need to be...
6129540 6131334 to frame your own son for murder?
6135630 6136839 I don't follow.
6136922 6138424 I got all the evidence.
6138507 6141177 Everything he used to frame you<br />was in his house.
6141761 6143846 He planted your prints<br />on the murder weapon,
6143929 6147224 hid it in your wall,<br />put the victim's blood in your clothes,
6147308 6148726 his hair on your coat.
6148809 6151937 Put your blood from that broken glass<br />at the murder scene.
6152563 6153731 Why would he do that?
6154857 6156651 Why does he hate you so much?
6164575 6165868 'Cause I turned him in.
6167328 6168329 What do you mean?
6168412 6170164 The tax case<br />he went to prison for.
6170790 6172458 I was the one who called the IRS.
6173275 6174919 No. The file says that<br />was someone named--
6175002 6176045 File's wrong.
6177338 6178464 It was me.
6198192 6200027 We never could tie that gun to you.
6200653 6202655 Looks like you got away with that one.
6204448 6205825 But just between us...
6207868 6208869 tell me.
6210121 6212039 It was you who shot Muncie, wasn't it?
6221048 6222258 Muncie coming?
6223426 6224593 Muncie is dead.
6225386 6226721 You killed him.
6230516 6231934 They have newspapers here.
6232017 6233561 Muncie likes to read the newspaper.
6247575 6249452 0-5-2-3!
6253122 6254290 Sorry.
6257001 6258169 He's not doing well.
6260379 6261881 Why do you wanna see him?
6261964 6263174 He tried to frame you.
6263716 6265301 Yeah, I mean,
6265384 6267845 he still killed the man<br />who raped my daughter.
6267928 6270306 And that's okay with you? Murder?
6270389 6272975 If I could, I'd dig Palmer up<br />and I'd kill him again.
6275269 6278939 By the way, they're moving him<br />to a medical facility tomorrow.
6279023 6280733 I tried to get him moved sooner,
6281692 6282860 but bureaucracy.
6285112 6286739 He went so fast, didn't he?
6287907 6289366 Fortunately for you.
6290868 6291869 How do you mean?
6291952 6293788 If he hadn't been losing his mind,
6293871 6295956 he might have gotten away<br />with framing you.
6296040 6297208 Lucky for me, then.
6299960 6301045 Yeah.
6303214 6304924 Confirming, three is open.
6327822 6329114 Hey, Dad.
6329198 6330783 Is today Sunday?
6332326 6334203 No. No, it's not.
6334995 6336413 It's Wednesday, Dad.
6337832 6339166 - Why?<br />- Well...
6341460 6342920 my son likes football.
6345673 6346674 Is that so?
6346757 6347842 Yeah.
6350302 6352429 Sometimes we go to the Rose Bowl.
6357184 6358853 Well, I bet he loves that.
6358936 6360479 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
6362398 6363482 But...
6372639 6374209 Sunday...
6376328 6377621 I love you, Dad.
6386046 6387047 Yeah.
6458911 6461288 - Who wants to get beat?<br />- I don't know.
