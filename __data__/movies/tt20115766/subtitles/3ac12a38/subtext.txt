129172 130782 Cassie, can I have some coffee?
130782 131870 [Cassie] Okay.
133307 134351 [clears throat]
135222 137528 You heard about this broad<br />out in Weasley?
137528 141706 Oh, old-school,<br />newspaper, I like it.
141706 144361 Yeah... You know, the news<br />does come on your phone now,
144361 145754 it's a new thing.
145754 147843 Says the man<br />with ten thousand books.
147843 149671 Hmm. Thank you.
149671 152891 Makes her husband breakfast,<br />for 35 years.
152891 156852 One day, she starts putting<br />a little bit of antifreeze
156852 158810 on his orange juice<br />every morning.
158810 160638 Why, was he cold?
162858 165513 [Muncie] What we got here?
165513 169691 Oh... "Empiricism<br />and the Philosophy of Mind".
169691 171693 [laughs] Bunch of crock.
174130 175871 Wilfrid Sellars wrote this?
175871 179570 Yeah, interesting guy.<br />You know Wilfrid Sellars?
179570 181224 No, but I know Peter Sellars.
181224 183095 - [laughing]<br />- Okay...
185924 188579 It took this guy eight months<br />to die from the antifreeze.
189885 191626 That's dedication.
191626 193845 You gotta give her points<br />for tenacity.
193845 196326 Come on. Eight months?
196326 198633 Can you imagine hating<br />anyone that much?
198633 201940 Honestly? I can think<br />of a few candidates, yeah.
201940 203115 How did they catch her?
203115 205248 Mmm... doesn't say.
205248 207816 Maybe they... [laughs]
207816 209252 Maybe when they tried<br />to embalm the guy,
209252 211254 the formaldehyde wouldn't set.
211254 214257 "I pumped two barrels<br />of that shit into him
214257 215911 and it keeps leaking out."
215911 217782 Put him in the deep freeze<br />and he's still warm.
217782 221264 [laughs]<br />That's good, that's good.
221264 224180 - Thank you.<br />- Hi there, Cassie.
224180 227139 Cassie, can I get a coffee?
227139 228228 Already got you.
229664 232841 I guess I need it.
232841 234016 [sighs]
236018 237672 You're such a skinny dude.
237672 240152 Where you put all that?
240152 243112 My old man said I have<br />a hollow cock.
243112 244983 [laughs] Really?
244983 247943 Your father said that,<br />"hollow cock". Interesting.
247943 250032 Yeah, he's a philosopher, too.
250032 251642 [laughs]
256343 259302 I'm going to go<br />right to the airport from here.
259302 261783 I have to go out of town<br />for a couple of days.
261783 263480 - You? What for?<br />- Yeah.
263480 265613 Personal stuff, no big deal.
265613 266831 I'll be back the day<br />after tomorrow.
266831 268703 Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.
269921 271532 - Personal?<br />- Yeah.
271532 273011 Good.
273795 276319 Because if Jericho found out<br />you went out of town on a job...
276319 278234 Give me a little credit,<br />I don't have a death wish.
278234 279975 Then why are you even going?
279975 282238 Like I said, personal.
282238 283848 No big deal.
283848 286503 I'll be back tomorrow.
286503 287939 - Okay.<br />- [Knox] Yeah.
295599 296774 [utensils clattering]
299168 300300 Are you okay?
301388 303041 Good.
303041 304304 [Muncie] Okay...
306436 307959 I'm going to get the check.
307959 310266 The check? We just got<br />the plate of food.
310266 312050 I know but I...
312050 313530 don't want to be late,<br />I have to get to the airport.
313530 315532 You got five minutes<br />to eat some food.
315532 317012 [Knox] Hurry up,<br />take five minutes.
317012 318274 Jesus Christ...
320972 323932 All right, anything<br />comes up, call me.
323932 325455 What the hell?
325455 327283 When did you get the new car?
327283 330068 Oh... Eh... Oh.
333594 336553 So, you're not even going to<br />tell me where you're going now.
336553 338381 I'll tell you when I come back.
338381 340165 [grunts]
340165 341471 [door closing]

345170 346215 Apple.
348783 349827 Dog.
358140 359359 Ehm...
360795 362449 [grunts and clicks tongue]
366453 367497 Car.

396091 398354 [clattering]
400878 401923 [door opening]
404012 405056 How are you today?
406275 409191 Well... you tell me.
409191 413456 My initial suspicions<br />were incorrect.
413456 414979 It's not Alzheimer's.
416851 418505 Okay.
418505 420898 What is it?
420898 422334 You're suffering<br />from a condition
422334 424249 known as<br />Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
424249 427601 It presents initially in much<br />the same way as Alzheimer's.
427601 429037 So, what's the difference?
429037 430255 Speed of progression.
433345 437088 I'm guessing...<br />you don't mean it's slower.
439395 441136 In your case,<br />it's incredibly fast.
446881 448273 What's the treatment?
448273 449405 There's no treatment.
452669 456064 The thing you have to<br />remember about dementia
456064 458719 is the thought-feeling<br />connection.
458719 460938 You have a thought,<br />creates a feeling.
460938 464159 You lose a thought,<br />you're left with a feeling.
464159 467249 So, you'll be going along and...
467249 469033 all of a sudden,
469033 471253 you'll be unreasonably happy<br />and you won't know why.
471253 474561 Or you'll have<br />this wave of depression
474561 476563 and you won't know why.
476563 480392 You'll find yourself...<br />[echoing] forgetting people,
480392 483700 even those you have<br />a connection with.
483700 485659 You'll become displaced<br />in time and space...
485659 486790 [distorting and fading]
486790 489314 [muffled sound]
495277 496887 Right now, you're mostly lucid
496887 500064 with small patches of confusion<br />and mental lapse.
500064 501805 So, then it'll reverse.
501805 503938 The moments of lucidity<br />will become the exception
503938 505896 and eventually,<br />go away altogether.
505896 507985 How much time do I have?
507985 509334 It's progressing<br />more aggressively
509334 510422 than I would like...
510422 511859 - Uhm...<br />- How much time?
513774 518779 You're looking at weeks,<br />not months.
518779 520520 If you have any arrangements<br />to make,
520520 524132 I suggest you do so<br />as quickly as possible.
524132 526613 Do you have family<br />that can take care of you?
529659 532227 - None that would.<br />- [doctor] All right.
532227 536318 Then, I suggest you look<br />into care facilities.
538886 542063 This is a very good place...
542063 543586 in your area.
553509 555424 I'm sorry.
555424 558253 That's okay, doc.
558253 560995 Even if I hated you<br />for telling me,
560995 562736 I'd forget soon enough.

590241 591939 <i>you don't want to tell me</i>.
591939 594376 [Annie] Secrets are secrets,<br />so I can't tell you.
594376 597031 [Knox laughs]
597031 599033 [Annie] I finished<br />the last book you lent me.
599033 601557 [Knox] Oh, yeah?
601557 604516 What did you think?
604516 607128 I liked it but<br />the end was stupid.
607128 609783 Really?
609783 611349 He just lets them chop off<br />his head
611349 613656 while the other guy walks away?
613656 615527 Well, see...
615527 619662 His whole character arc leads<br />to that moment. You know?
620707 624798 It's a... sacrifice<br />for the greater good, you know?
624798 627844 Mmm...<br />like the end of "Casablanca"?
627844 629759 Yeah, like the end<br />of "Casablanca," exactly.
629759 632283 It was bullshit, too.
632283 634372 Rick would take the girl<br />10 times out of 10.
634372 638115 "A far, far better thing"<br />my ass.
638115 639769 Wow.
639769 642380 Is everyone from Kraków<br />that cynical?
642380 644774 I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.
647472 650040 What day is it?
650040 652564 - Thursday?<br />- No, no, I mean...
652564 654001 I mean what date.
654001 655567 The fifth, does that<br />mean something?
655567 657700 [sighs]
657700 660355 It's my son's birthday,
660355 664576 who hasn't spoken with me<br />many, many years.
668711 671758 Why does he hate you so much?
671758 677067 I'm what the Science journals<br />refer to as a "lousy father."
677067 678895 Mmm...
678895 680897 He found out<br />what I did for a living.
680897 682420 - [woman] Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
682420 683987 [woman] What do you do<br />for a living?
683987 685685 I work for the IRS.
685685 687687 Just like that, I hate you too.
689645 691038 I've been coming here
691038 694215 once a week for almost...<br />four years
694215 697871 and that's the first thing<br />you've said about yourself.
697871 699350 What do you want to know?
699350 701352 I'll tell you anything,<br />just ask me.
701352 703833 Is that your real name,<br />Aristotle?
703833 706314 No, it's a nickname
706314 708142 the guys in my platoon gave me,
708142 709752 I was in the first Gulf War
709752 711145 and I used to read a lot<br />of books,
711145 713538 like philosophy<br />and... like that.
714539 715932 [phone vibrating]
720894 722156 I got to go.
723766 725812 [sighs]
734037 737737 The thing with your son<br />explains a lot, though.
737737 739782 What do you mean?
739782 741001 You know how they say
741001 742916 haunted houses have cold spots?
744526 746223 Stand in certain areas,
746223 749009 and a chill goes down your spine<br />like an artic breeze.
749009 751054 What the hell<br />you're talking about?
751054 752447 That's what's like here.
752447 754318 You walk in the door<br />and you feel it.
754318 756494 Only it isn't a ghost.
756494 757931 What is it?
757931 759802 Loneliness.
761848 764415 See you next Thursday,<br />not really Aristotle.
769290 770334 [Muncie] This guy's<br />a piece of work.
770334 771596 [Knox] I don't care.
771596 773468 Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>
773468 774991 Why do we always<br />have to go through this?
774991 776776 Why do we have to<br />go through what?
776776 779169 You ask me if I want to know<br />the details of the job
779169 780780 and I say, "no, I really don't"
780780 782694 and then you tell me<br />the details of the job
782694 784131 and then I say, "shut up" and<br />we go through it again and again
784131 785567 and we always go through
785567 786611 the same thing<br />every fucking time!
786611 787830 The question is,
787830 789266 why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
789266 790485 Ready.
790485 794924 [mariachi music in background]
794924 798536 Hey, this could be<br />my last job for a while.
798536 800930 What the fuck is going on, John?
800930 802889 Nothing, I just need to<br />take care of a few things
802889 804412 I'll clear it with Jericho.
804412 806196 Okay, how long are you<br />going to be out?
807589 808633 Hard to say.
809634 811854 Come on. Let's go.
811854 813029 This motherfucker sells<br />men for human labor,
813029 814204 that's a thing now.
814204 815771 Jesus Christ.
815771 816946 I thought trafficking<br />was like sex shit.
816946 818469 Same thing every time.
818469 819731 Didn't we just go<br />through this at the car?
822169 825172 Why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
825172 826564 Because in ten minutes,
826564 829916 Tommy, he's not going to<br />be anybody.
829916 831221 Let's go get this done.

995864 996996 Hello?
998780 999824 Yeah.
1001000 1003176 Well, we were...
1003176 1005526 expecting only one person<br />to be there.
1006527 1007658 We got split up.
1009182 1010748 I guess he figured...
1010748 1012620 I don't know,<br />we could cover more ground.
1014187 1017016 And I heard shots...
1018104 1019931 [muffled sound]
1021455 1022499 Christ, Tommy.
1024806 1026242 [Muncie moaning]
1026242 1027591 I didn't mean to.
1031247 1034033 - Knox...<br />- I'm sorry, Tommy.
1038124 1039125 [thud]
1043738 1044782 Yeah, he was.
1047089 1050832 <i>Yeah. I made sure the scene<br />was clean and then I left.</i>
1057186 1058231 Okay.
1059362 1060407 Thank you.
1066717 1067805 [camera shutter clicking]
1072593 1073898 [camera shutter clicking]
1077989 1079948 You're buying this?
1079948 1082037 Five bullets, three victims?
1082037 1084735 Had to happen fast.
1084735 1086868 Are you thinking<br />there's a third shooter?
1086868 1088391 There's no evidence of that.
1091438 1093657 Growing up, I hated my mother.
1093657 1095746 Is that right?
1095746 1097792 She was a stereotype,<br />overbearing,
1097792 1100055 Asian, hellicopter mom.
1100055 1102144 An "A" minus meant<br />I didn't have any pride.
1102144 1103885 My mother was a drunk, so...
1103885 1105539 - This is about me.<br />- Sorry.
1105539 1108455 She hates my chosen profession<br />but, ironically,
1108455 1111849 made me a good detective.
1111849 1113242 Realizing her wanting me
1113242 1114852 to excel was about her<br />and not me,
1114852 1116245 [camera shutter clicking]
1116245 1118378 gave me my first lesson<br />in motive.
1118378 1120989 She taught me that the details<br />were important.
1120989 1122382 The answers lie
1122382 1123818 in the little things<br />other people,
1123818 1125863 she meant white people, overlook.
1125863 1128388 With all due respect,<br />is this going somewhere?
1128388 1130259 There's water<br />all over the floor.
1130259 1133132 That means the shower was on<br />when the curtain came down.
1133132 1135221 [Rale] Okay.
1135221 1137658 - So?<br />- So,
1137658 1139355 he killed them, they killed him,
1139355 1141183 all in a hurry,<br />bang, bang, bang.
1143054 1144230 Who turned off the shower?
1162378 1163684 [Arabic music playing]
1172432 1174347 [electricity buzzing]
1178568 1179613 [doorbell]
1182093 1183138 [door alarm]
1185793 1188230 - Hey, Knox.<br />- Hey.
1188230 1189927 Sit down. Want a drink?
1189927 1193235 Yeah. Yeah, whisky.
1193235 1196020 So...
1196020 1199241 you just swing by to say hello?
1199241 1201200 No, closing out.
1201200 1203637 I have to do it<br />pretty quick, too.
1203637 1205334 - Quick?<br />- Yeah.
1205334 1207206 - Jericho knows?<br />- He can't.
1208207 1210383 That makes it tough.
1210383 1211732 Raise your commission, I guess.
1213864 1218086 I'm uh... I'm going away.
1218086 1220175 For good this time.
1220175 1222786 And I don't want this<br />blowing back on Jericho.
1222786 1224048 What happened?
1224048 1225789 A job went South.
1225789 1229532 I set the scene out to buy<br />myself some time but...
1229532 1232535 - It's not going to last long.<br />- I'm sure about that.
1232535 1234581 Three people,
1234581 1236235 all shot each other<br />with the same gun.
1237497 1238802 Yeah, that's not good.
1240326 1242284 My gun.
1242284 1243633 - That's worse.<br />- Yeah.
1244721 1247637 So time is of the essence.<br />How do you have your capital.
1247637 1249335 Mostly cash.
1249335 1252076 Got some paintings<br />you got to sell. Some stones.
1252076 1254688 - That's simple enough.<br />- Yeah.
1258866 1260302 A list of three people.
1260302 1262435 All three, equal shares.
1262435 1265046 Nothing in here<br />for Muncie's family?
1265046 1266526 Muncie didn't have anybody.
1268615 1271922 I can't have any of this<br />touch those people.
1271922 1273576 This money has to be clean.
1276536 1280061 Gather your assets,<br />I'll set it up.
1280061 1281410 A couple of days.
1281410 1283107 Hey, this stays<br />between you and me.
1283107 1287068 Yeah, and I'm going to tell who?
1287068 1288983 All right.
1288983 1290245 All right, thanks.
1295642 1297339 [birds singing]
1304912 1306174 [machinery beeping]
1318360 1319796 What's up?
1319796 1321537 This key doesn't work<br />on the... uh...
1323234 1325498 - The thing, the...<br />- Lock?
1325498 1327804 - Lock, yeah.<br />- All right.
1327804 1329458 Yeah, the green ones,
1329458 1330590 they go to our other facility,<br />out in Van Nuys.
1330590 1331678 Okay.
1333593 1335203 Hey, could you do me a favor?
1335203 1338032 Could you... uh... write down<br />the number...
1338032 1339599 - The address?<br />- The address.
1339599 1340861 Yeah, got you.
1343167 1344560 [crickets chirping]
1352263 1353830 [doorbell]
1357225 1358574 [knocking]
1364667 1365973 [aggressive knocking]
1368497 1370760 [doorbell]
1370760 1372762 [wood floor creaking]
1374111 1376070 [aggressive knocking]
1390737 1392434 Sorry, I didn't mean to...
1392434 1395176 just to show up like this,<br />I should've called.
1395176 1398701 I didn't mean to ambush you,<br />I'm sorry.
1398701 1400137 Do I know you?
1403140 1406230 Okay, I guess I deserve that.
1406230 1410278 You got to know I wouldn't<br />be here unless I was desperate.
1410278 1412585 Okay? I need your help.
1415326 1418286 Dad, could you please<br />just talk to me?
1418286 1419374 Dad.
1420680 1422421 Miles... yeah.
1424248 1427817 Sure, Miles.<br />Come here. Come on in.
1427817 1432082 Thank you, I just...<br />[clears throat]
1432082 1435216 - Have a seat.<br />- [exhales]
1435216 1440830 [glass clanking]
1440830 1444181 [cork popping]
1444181 1448447 No, no, no, I'm... I'm sober.<br />Nine years.
1455584 1457934 That's your blood?
1457934 1461938 Yeah, my hand is... Uhm...
1461938 1465159 I cut it in a...
1465159 1467857 This is my blood<br />and that's someone else's.
1467857 1469598 Holy fuck!
1469598 1472035 [sobbing]
1472035 1473123 [exhales]
1475474 1476649 I fucked up.
1478738 1481262 I fucked up really bad.
1481262 1483656 Okay... okay.
1483656 1487050 Okay, take it easy.
1487050 1488922 Catch your breath.
1488922 1490924 - [exhales]<br />- Tell me what happened.
1494493 1496103 I killed someone.
1498061 1499498 Did they deserve killing?
1503589 1505765 Okay, start there.
1507506 1509856 [Miles] Okay. [clears throat]
1509856 1513120 [exhales] You have<br />a granddaughter.
1513120 1516776 - Kaylee.<br />- How did you know about her?
1516776 1519213 Your mother told me,<br />right after she was born.
1521171 1523696 Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.
1523696 1526916 What is she, like 12? 13?
1526916 1528918 She's 16.
1528918 1530529 Here...
1535708 1538232 - Cute kid.<br />- Yeah.
1538232 1539320 She's a kid.
1542366 1543846 And she met this guy...
1545500 1547241 Online. This...
1547241 1549852 piece of shit!
1549852 1551854 The guy was 32 years old.
1551854 1556380 This son of a bitch<br />gets her pregnant.
1556380 1559079 She's 16 years old,<br />she's my little girl.
1559079 1563126 So, I go over<br />to his house, you know?
1563126 1566216 I was just going to put<br />the fear of God on him.
1566216 1570046 And I show up and he's...<br />[exhales and sniffs]
1570046 1572440 more than I expected. Okay?
1572440 1574050 [sniffs]
1575530 1578359 He wouldn't shut up.<br />Just kept talking,
1578359 1581057 and talking and talking<br />about my fucking daughter.
1581057 1583233 Like, saying shit<br />about her, like...
1583233 1585148 "she loves it,"<br />"She wanted more."
1585148 1589370 Called her "ripe."<br />Called her ripe, dad!
1589370 1593330 [groans] Fuck! I just lost it.
1593330 1596420 So I grabbed a knife<br />and I sho...
1596420 1598509 I shoved it into his neck.
1601643 1604167 And I stabbed him.
1604167 1607127 I just... couldn't stop.
1607127 1608389 [muffled scream]
1609346 1610565 I didn't care.
1612132 1614134 Because I wasn't even<br />in the room, I was...
1615352 1616397 [exhales]
1622708 1623839 Did you bury this guy?
1624971 1626320 Did I bury him?
1626320 1628148 [Knox] Yeah.
1628148 1630541 No, why?
1630541 1632239 Because if you did, I was<br />going to dig him up
1632239 1633414 and kill him again.
1634894 1635938 [exhales]
1637505 1638549 [exhales]
1639725 1641248 Oh, my God...
1642858 1644077 So, why did you come to me?
1648124 1650344 Are you kidding? [laughs]
1651867 1654391 Well, I mean...
1654391 1656611 You're the only person<br />I know that can... I...
1656611 1658657 This isn't my world.
1658657 1663009 - I don't know how to...<br />- Get rid of a body.
1663009 1666882 I never asked you<br />for anything in my life.
1666882 1671844 Okay? And I'm here because<br />I had nowhere else to go.
1671844 1673933 Now you need me.
1673933 1676370 [Miles] Yeah, that's what<br />this is, I'm desperate.
1676370 1679678 Okay? I'm so fucking desperate<br />that I'm here, at your house,
1679678 1681201 asking you for help.
1681201 1682506 Now, are you [shouting]<br />going to help me or not?
1682506 1684944 [crickets chirping]
1693256 1694736 Where's the murder weapon?
1720849 1722459 Here.
1722459 1724331 Put your clothes<br />in that plastic bag,
1724331 1726725 then take a shower<br />and scrub down everything.
1726725 1728944 Underneath the fingernails,<br />clean everything.
1728944 1730772 Then, afterwards,<br />I'm going to wrap and clean
1730772 1732339 that hand of yours.
1732339 1734602 - Then what?<br />- Then?
1734602 1736038 You go home to your wife
1736038 1739694 and you never<br />mention this again.
1739694 1741870 My whole life, I never<br />asked you for anything.
1741870 1745178 Yeah, you said that already.
1745178 1749748 Here, use that. I'm going to<br />need those boxers, too.
1754100 1756885 Hey, where's the body?
1829131 1831568 Write it down. Write it down.
1861250 1863774 [suspenseful music]
1914042 1918264 [football match in Spanish]
1918264 1920701 [groaning]
1924879 1925924 [thud]
1954778 1955823 [grunting]
2039428 2041561 [crickets chirping]
2056271 2057577 There you are.
2060362 2061624 What are you doing?
2063104 2064105 Nothing.
2067761 2069545 I talked to her.
2071112 2072331 [Miles] What did she say?
2074811 2077031 She wants you to take her.
2077031 2078076 [Miles] What?
2079468 2081514 Well, I assumed this would be...
2081514 2084125 you know, like,<br />a mother-daughter thing.
2084125 2086649 Well, apparently it isn't.
2088260 2089913 What happened to your hand?
2099401 2100750 I have to tell you something.
2105146 2108106 [tension music]
2110543 2111935 All right, what do we got?
2111935 2114416 Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.
2114416 2116070 We're waiting<br />for the Interpol jacket
2116070 2118899 but safe to say he wasn't<br />a model citizen.
2118899 2121336 The woman was local,<br />Annette Elmora.
2121336 2122816 Yeah, we're thinking<br />maybe he picked her up
2122816 2124383 at a club or something.
2124383 2126733 You know, wrong place-wrong time<br />kind of thing.
2126733 2128909 Victim number three is<br />where it gets interesting.
2128909 2130302 Meet Thomas Muncie,
2130302 2131999 suspected hitter for Jericho.
2131999 2134349 Conspicuously missing<br />from the carnage,
2134349 2136830 this man, John Knox.
2136830 2138832 Traffic cam shot this<br />six blocks away
2138832 2140225 around the time of death.
2140225 2142401 Facial recognition flagged him.
2142401 2143619 That could just be<br />a driver, though.
2143619 2144968 We're sure this guy's a driver?
2144968 2147145 What's his jacket say?
2147145 2149495 Not much. He did a six-year<br />stretch for tax evasion
2149495 2151714 and that's only because<br />someone ratted them out.
2151714 2153673 Other than that<br />and his service record,
2153673 2155414 there's nothing on him.
2155414 2156980 Which means, whatever<br />this guy does for a living,
2156980 2158112 he's pretty good at it.
2158112 2159505 [Ikari] Smart, too.
2159505 2161333 According to the tax<br />auditor's notes,
2161333 2163378 John Knox holds two PhDs.
2163378 2166512 One in English Lit<br />and one in US History.
2166512 2168775 Even taught in Bucknell<br />a couple of years.
2168775 2171473 And we're thinking this guy<br />kills people for a living?
2171473 2173127 Why?
2173127 2175477 Hopefully, we'll get<br />to ask him ourselves.
2175477 2177218 What branch of service<br />was he in?
2177218 2180526 Army. He was a deep<br />reconnaissance officer.
2180526 2182963 Remind me what that is again?
2182963 2184443 Someone who goes off alone
2184443 2186401 behind enemy lines<br />for weeks at a time.
2186401 2188011 Then, maybe we just<br />bring him in
2188011 2189448 as a cooperating witness.
2189448 2191711 Friend-of-the-victim<br />kind of thing.
2191711 2193930 He might slip up<br />and give us something.
2193930 2195845 Does he seem like someone<br />who makes mistakes?
2195845 2199197 Hey, boss, check your texts.
2199197 2200720 [voices in radios]
2202635 2204202 Another body.
2204202 2205899 And now, we got three<br />on my board already.
2205899 2207988 Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.
2207988 2210338 That's your métier.
2210338 2212253 Métier? Really?
2213646 2216126 [salsa music playing]
2220653 2222394 - John Knox.<br />- Hey!
2222394 2224265 - Hi.<br />- Is he upstairs?
2224265 2226006 Yeah. I'm supposed to think<br />he's doing the books.
2226006 2228400 - What's he really doing?<br />- Watching TV.
2228400 2230619 - I married a little boy.<br />- Yeah.
2230619 2232534 Well, he married up,<br />that's for sure.
2232534 2233622 [Ludmilla laughs]
2237757 2240325 [Knox] Xavier! Coming up.
2242805 2247245 [voices on TV]
2252641 2255209 Look at this skinny<br />son of a bitch.
2255209 2259344 They rescued him<br />from a big cat sanctuary.
2259344 2262260 Locals toss him stray dogs<br />in a cave
2262260 2264305 so he can have something to eat.
2264305 2266438 Kind of reminds me of you.
2266438 2268701 You know, when I first found you<br />after your war.
2270659 2271921 I never ate a dog.
2273923 2276752 [Philo] What's this,<br />grocery list?
2276752 2279277 It's a plan,<br />and I'm going to need your help.
2279277 2280408 Just read it.
2284325 2285892 Hey, Ludmilla looks good.
2287328 2290723 She still hasn't realized
2290723 2293203 what a mistake she made<br />marrying me.
2293203 2295423 You're learning any Russian?
2295423 2298861 Just the stuff she says<br />I need to know.
2298861 2301429 "Yes, dear." "Please."
2301429 2302735 All the essentials.
2306391 2308349 Okay, lay it on me.
2310133 2311918 Stabbed at least 17 times.
2313963 2315400 I put time of death between
2315400 2316836 3:00 and 8:00 p.m.<br />yesterday afternoon.
2316836 2318141 I'll get a more precise<br />time frame
2318141 2319360 when I get him to the shop.
2319360 2321536 - All right.<br />- Yeah.
2321536 2323756 Thanks, bro.
2323756 2325975 There's no murder weapon yet,
2325975 2328500 but there's a knife missing<br />from that kitchen block.
2328500 2331067 I mean, it doesn't even look<br />like anything was stolen.
2331067 2332634 He's got an expensive watch<br />on his wrist,
2332634 2335115 he's got a wallet<br />full of large bills...
2335115 2336725 I know this racist<br />piece of crap.
2336725 2339075 His name is Andrew Palmer.
2339075 2340686 He moves cash around
2340686 2342470 for the Aryan Brotherhood<br />but... he's a cog.
2342470 2345125 - Not a shot caller.<br />- So, he winds up dead.
2345125 2347388 There's no big mystery there.
2347388 2349303 But he also did a stretch<br />a few years back
2349303 2350913 for kiddie porn.
2350913 2353699 And this... this doesn't look<br />like business.
2353699 2355962 This looks personal.
2355962 2357311 Detective, gate guard out<br />front says
2357311 2358530 he was knocked out<br />last night.
2359835 2360880 I got this.
2363012 2366102 Bag the victim's computers,<br />any flash drives and discs.
2366102 2368409 - What are we looking for?<br />- You'll know when you see it.
2368409 2370193 Oh, and see if you can find<br />his phone,
2370193 2371369 he didn't have it on him.
2371369 2372413 Got it.
2374241 2377157 [voices on radios]
2379072 2381074 So, how long have you known?
2381074 2382902 Uh... not long.
2384382 2386775 Doc says this thing<br />moves pretty fast.
2386775 2389169 Oh, Jesus, Knox.
2389169 2392172 I can't think of anything worse.
2392172 2394130 Except maybe your pecker<br />stops working.
2394130 2400354 Actually, I'm looking forward<br />to forgetting some things.
2400354 2405446 Muncie... Christ.<br />I can't imagine what the--
2405446 2407317 That's like me shooting you.
2407317 2409711 I don't even remember<br />doing it. I mean, I know...
2409711 2413106 I know I did it but I have<br />no recollection of the event.
2413106 2415021 Well, count your blessings.
2416414 2417763 This is a radical plan.
2417763 2420809 It's the only way<br />I can figure it.
2420809 2424726 This kid's DNA is<br />all over the place.
2424726 2426249 He actually bled on the guy,
2426249 2428295 he's got his fingerprints<br />everywhere.
2428295 2431080 He might as well just<br />signed off on the job.
2431080 2433082 Still, if you don't<br />pull this off,
2433082 2437347 - you're both fucked.<br />- [Knox] Yeah.
2437347 2439828 - I'm fucked either way.<br />- That's true.
2439828 2442440 That's why I'm asking you<br />to help me.
2442440 2444529 Look, just check in with me.
2444529 2447923 Just check in with me<br />now and then. You know?
2447923 2450926 - Make sure I'm on point.<br />- Yeah, of course, sure.
2450926 2456236 Just so you don't ever thing<br />this stupid plan is my idea.
2456236 2457890 I'm sure you'll remind me.
2460283 2461981 You want to know<br />the funny thing?
2461981 2464505 Let's say I pull this thing off,
2464505 2466855 I won't even know<br />if I did it or not.
2466855 2469205 It's encouraging.
2469205 2471947 This plan is<br />precision work, man.
2471947 2473819 - One hair out of place--<br />- Oh, I know.
2475516 2477562 I know.
2477562 2479868 I know I could pull this off.
2479868 2481174 The question is, can you?
2482610 2485526 So, you didn't see his face,<br />didn't see his height, nothing?
2485526 2486614 - No.<br />- Okay.
2486614 2487920 All right, thank you.
2489965 2491140 [blows out]
2491140 2492359 Beautiful day.
2492359 2494056 Sure.
2494056 2495493 What did you get?
2495493 2496581 Don't suppose he can<br />ID our killer.
2496581 2498147 No, he was attacked from behind.
2498147 2499714 He didn't see anything.
2499714 2501803 Happened a little before<br />three in the morning.
2501803 2503196 Doesn't fit the timeline.
2503196 2505633 M.E. said he was killed<br />before 8:00 p.m.
2505633 2507983 [Rale] So you think the attack<br />on the guard is unrelated?
2507983 2510595 It's related, I'm just...<br />not sure how, yet.
2510595 2512901 They get anything off<br />these security cameras?
2512901 2514512 Well, that part is weird.
2514512 2516688 They feed into a DVR<br />in the utility closet.
2516688 2519299 - There's no hard drive.<br />- You mean it doesn't work?
2519299 2521606 No, I mean the tech<br />couldn't get playback
2521606 2522781 so we opened up the DVR<br />and looked inside,
2522781 2524173 no hard drive.
2524173 2525435 - Found his phone.<br />- [Ikari sighs]
2525435 2527220 Can't open it, though.
2527220 2528787 It's got one of those facial<br />recognition locks on it.
2528787 2532181 - Okay, head back inside.<br />- Okay.
2532181 2533705 What am I looking for?
2533705 2535837 His face. I assume<br />that's where it is...
2537056 2538100 Right.
2543889 2546108 [soft jazz music]

2590283 2591414 [knocking]
2596506 2597638 Did you forget I was coming?
2598857 2600554 Oh... no, no.
2609171 2610216 How are you?
2613567 2616265 Good. I'm...
2616265 2618180 kind of knotted up.
2618180 2619442 That's why I'm here.
2622750 2625187 I finished the book.
2625187 2628669 It was... better but I knew<br />he was going to die in the end.
2628669 2630540 He kind of had to.
2630540 2632630 I'll find you another one here.
2636198 2637330 This is your ex?
2639811 2641856 Yeah.
2641856 2645468 - Well, she's gorgeous.<br />- Yeah.
2645468 2648428 Hey... [mumbles]
2648428 2653215 put that down--<br />[distorted and silence]
2653215 2654652 Why don't I get ready?
2660440 2661571 Fuck me.
2681504 2685247 - These paintings are all real?<br />- Yeah.
2685247 2688990 - It's safer than cash.<br />- Are they worth a lot?
2688990 2692864 - Why do you have them?<br />- Part of my cashing-out process.
2692864 2694126 What?
2697259 2701133 - What do you mean "cashing out"?<br />- Forget I said it. Forget it.
2702612 2704353 Did you find me something?
2704353 2708183 [distant and echoing voice]
2708183 2711404 Hello? You picked me<br />another book?
2713058 2714624 You want a book?
2714624 2718933 Knox, are you having<br />a stroke or something?
2718933 2721762 - Maybe you should sit down?<br />- You know what? Maybe...
2723895 2725287 Maybe it's better<br />if you just go.
2727855 2729335 Good idea.
2759669 2761715 Sorry.
2761715 2765545 I just got a...<br />Got a thing I got to do.
2765545 2768722 - Same time next week?<br />- Yeah.
2770202 2771812 Yeah, you bet, next week.
2771812 2773727 Are you sure you're<br />going to be okay?
2773727 2774815 Never better.
2787567 2792441 [suspenseful music]
2805324 2806368 [shutter clicking]
2810024 2811765 [elevator bell]
2811765 2813332 Here.
2814812 2816291 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
2816291 2819468 We have an appointment.<br />Last name's Knox.
2819468 2821731 Okay. All right, here it is.
2821731 2823864 You must be Kaylee. And you are?
2823864 2826736 I'm the father...<br />Her father, not the...
2826736 2828956 - I'm her dad.<br />- Okay, dad.
2828956 2832220 See, sign here.<br />Initial here, here and here.
2832220 2833787 Before we do the procedure,
2833787 2835833 the law says we have to<br />ask you a few questions.
2835833 2837182 Not about the father<br />of the child
2837182 2838923 or anything like that,
2838923 2841012 just to make sure<br />that <i>you</i> want to be here.
2841012 2842840 That'd be okay?
2842840 2844624 I guess so.
2844624 2845712 [nurse] Good.
2846800 2849281 Now it's your turn.
2849281 2850891 I need a couple of signatures<br />from you,
2850891 2853111 starting here on the consent<br />form.
2860074 2861336 [nurse] All right,<br />guys, have a sit.
2861336 2862468 [both] Thank you.
2866515 2869997 [buzzing]
2869997 2871433 [echoing voice of Annie]<br /><i>Are you having</i>
2871433 2873218 <i>a stroke of something?</i>

2879702 2883358 [keeps vibrating]
2885578 2886927 Xavier, hey.
2886927 2889364 I'm calling to make sure<br />you're on track.
2889364 2893934 - On track with what?<br />- Your cockamamie plan is what.
2893934 2896328 You got your notepad?
2896328 2897851 Yeah.
2899592 2901637 Yeah, I'm on track,<br />don't worry about it.
2901637 2902900 He says "don't worry."
2903988 2907208 Do me a favor,<br />unlock your phone.
2907208 2909732 <i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>
2909732 2912953 - <i>Okay?</i><br />- Why?
2912953 2917305 Well, what if you need help<br />and you can't remember the code.
2917305 2920395 Right... right, okay.
2920395 2922006 Yeah, got it.
2922006 2923529 [sighs]
2926706 2930928 - You're there?<br />- Huh? Yeah.
2930928 2933191 I feel like I'm getting worse<br />every hour.
2936890 2938370 I'm running out of time.
2938370 2942635 So, stop wasting it<br />talking to me. Okay?

3022280 3024238 It's not even 4:30.
3024238 3025718 Oh, I'm almost 90.
3025718 3027502 Dinner time is<br />very important to me.
3027502 3029330 What's up?
3029330 3031767 [Knox] <i>Yeah, I'm looking at<br />some kind of locker key.</i>
3031767 3034031 <i>Do you know where that's from?</i>
3034031 3035554 [Philo] <i>You never confided</i>

3036642 3039601 I'm a crook, you know?
3039601 3041908 All right. Great, thanks,<br />I'll figure it out.
3041908 3043475 Hey, wait a minute.
3043475 3045216 Did you take the passcode<br />off your phone?
3045216 3047827 Ehm... yeah, I'm going to<br />do that now.
3047827 3049785 I'll do it right now. Okay?
3049785 3052788 Thanks. Say hi to Becky from me.
3052788 3056270 - Wait, who?<br />- <i>Becky.</i>
3056270 3058751 Ehm... okay.
3058751 3061188 - All right.<br />- How's he doing?
3061188 3064539 - He just called you Becky.<br />- Who's this Becky?
3064539 3066280 She was one of my wives.
3066280 3069457 I divorced her before<br />you were born, baby.
3069457 3072808 This business with Knox...<br />It's not good.
3072808 3075028 No.
3075028 3076203 It's not.

3188010 3190709 I ordered some food,<br />this place has great ribs.
3190709 3195061 I'm a vegan. Should we...?
3195061 3196889 Should we be meeting<br />in public like this?
3196889 3198195 No one knows us here.
3200458 3203722 - How's the hand?<br />- Well, it...
3203722 3206464 - hurts.<br />- If anyone asks you about it,
3206464 3208074 you cut on broken glass.
3208074 3209945 You were at my house,<br />we were having a drink.
3209945 3212905 What? Why would I be<br />at your place?
3212905 3214080 You were looking for<br />your old Hot Wheels,
3214080 3215516 make something up.
3219781 3221305 - How are you doing?<br />- How am I doing?
3221305 3222958 Yeah, uhm...
3224308 3226962 Spent the day<br />at the abortion clinic with...
3226962 3230662 my 16-year-old daughter<br />so, bad, I guess.
3230662 3232664 Pretty bad.
3232664 3236058 Not sleeping, not eating.<br />I haven't eaten since yesterday.
3236058 3237495 Uhm...
3237495 3239366 My hair is falling out.
3239366 3242021 So, I'm about to lose<br />my goddamn mind.
3242021 3245024 Okay, okay.<br />You need to get a grip.
3245024 3246852 I don't know how<br />to do this, I'm not...
3246852 3248375 I'm not like you, you know?
3250072 3251378 I'm not a killer.
3251378 3252466 [exhales]
3256383 3258472 You are, though.
3258472 3260779 What?
3260779 3263695 A killer.
3263695 3266959 Damn good one, too.<br />Not half-assed.
3266959 3270354 I was out at the scene.<br />Let me put it to you this way:
3272443 3276751 that wasn't what you call<br />a proportional response.
3276751 3279363 - I lost it.<br />- Understandable.
3279363 3282670 But now I need you<br />to pull it all together, okay?
3282670 3284324 You're like<br />a walking confession.
3284324 3285499 I'll try harder.
3285499 3288110 No, do the opposite. Relax.
3289895 3290939 Okay.
3292985 3296162 [plates clanking]
3296162 3299600 [exhales deeply]
3300601 3301689 Is she your only kid?
3304910 3310959 We... we lost one early on,<br />a miscarriage.
3311656 3313962 - Sorry, it's tough.<br />- Yeah.
3316225 3318445 More on Cheryl, actually.
3318445 3321056 What does she do, Cheryl?
3321056 3323363 Teaches fourth grade,
3323363 3325322 public school.
3325322 3329238 Yeah and... kids love her.
3329238 3331893 All right.<br />Boy, you guys are busy.
3331893 3334592 Working parents,<br />on the go all the time.
3334592 3337682 What's the typical day?
3337682 3341163 Tomorrow for instance,<br />what would you do tomorrow?
3341163 3343775 Go get breakfast somewhere
3343775 3345559 and walk around<br />Largemouth Village
3345559 3348083 and then Kaylee has<br />soccer and...
3348083 3351086 - You now.<br />- Do that. Do that.
3351086 3353088 - Just do that.<br />- Do that?
3353088 3356657 - [Knox] Yeah.<br />- We can't, she's laid up in bed.
3356657 3359747 Don't vary your routine,<br />do what you would normally do.
3365666 3366885 [sighs]
3379985 3381639 What happened to vegan?
3381639 3383554 Fuck it, I'm starving.
3383554 3386426 I've been starving<br />for six years.
3386426 3390778 You ever take the family<br />up to the cabin?
3390778 3393955 - The hunting cabin?<br />- Yeah.
3393955 3395435 I sold it, remember?
3395435 3397481 You signed the papers<br />two years ago.
3399918 3401267 These are so fucking good.
3402094 3404401 Yeah.
3404401 3405880 I remember that.<br />You know anything about the...
3406925 3408796 about if the owners...<br />I mean, if they use it...
3408796 3410450 full time or...
3410450 3411495 part time?
3411495 3413018 - The buyers?<br />- Yeah.
3415150 3417109 Well, I'm not renting it<br />to them. They...
3417109 3418632 I sold it to them.
3418632 3420634 They bought it, they own it.<br />I have no...
3420634 3422419 - Right.<br />- Why would I know what they do?
3422419 3423942 Okay, listen to me.
3426205 3427380 You just need to...
3428555 3429904 hold it together, okay?
3429904 3432559 We're almost there,<br />couple of days.
3432559 3433647 Okay.
3435388 3436433 Look at me.
3440349 3442264 I need you to use my balls.
3443527 3445006 What?
3445006 3447661 They're gonna connect Kaylee<br />to the dead guy.
3447661 3449533 Then they're gonna question you.
3449533 3451926 If you don't think you have<br />the balls for it, use mine.
3451926 3454929 Do whatever you think I would do<br />if I was on that chair.
3456191 3457628 All right?
3457628 3458716 What?
3466158 3467681 I never hated you, you know?
3469640 3470728 [Knox] Well...
3473252 3475123 Be understandable if you did.
3475123 3476647 You were a good dad in your way.
3478344 3479693 I remember a lot of good.
3481869 3484785 I remember ball games.<br />I remember you teaching me...
3484785 3485873 how to hunt.
3487701 3490051 I remember you letting me<br />eat pancakes in the pool.
3493620 3496449 I worshiped you.
3496449 3497929 I wanted to be just like you.
3501149 3502803 Then, you know, I found out.
3505458 3506503 And I thought...
3509157 3510811 [sighs]
3510811 3511986 What if I did?
3517296 3519428 Did what?
3519428 3521039 What if I wound up<br />just like you?
3526697 3527741 And here we are.
3532616 3533704 Yeah, here we are.
3575049 3577922 All right... Gelfuso, you're up.
3577922 3581403 [Gelfuso] Okay. Scene was<br />definitely staged.
3581403 3583057 Ballistics says<br />all three victims
3583057 3584711 killed with the same gun.
3584711 3586974 Uh, didn't see that coming.<br />That's a fun one.
3586974 3588541 - They find the gun?<br />- [Gelfuso] Yeah.
3588541 3590935 It was the one<br />in shower guy's hand.
3590935 3592719 Five shots total.
3592719 3595504 Only prints on the gun belong<br />to the dead Spaniard.
3596157 3598464 Anybody holding out<br />for a triple murder-suicide?
3598464 3600031 That would be a neat trick.
3600031 3601685 Specially the part<br />where he reaches out
3601685 3603687 and turns off the shower<br />after he's already dead.
3603687 3604905 - [Gelfuso] Nice catch.<br />- [detective] Thank you.
3607299 3608909 What else?
3608909 3610128 [Gelfuso] I scoured<br />every surveillance camera
3610128 3611738 in the area.
3611738 3613261 I can't put anyone<br />in the house with Muncie.
3613261 3615220 Least of all is<br />John Knox's character.
3615220 3616787 We know Knox's movements?
3616787 3618136 [Gelfuso] He hasn't used
3618136 3619616 his credit card<br />since the murder.
3619616 3621313 Two days before them,
3621313 3623968 he flies from Burbank to<br />San Francisco for 22 hours.
3623968 3625665 Why?
3625665 3627624 [Gelfuso] That part,<br />I haven't figured out yet.
3627624 3629277 But I got him on the return<br />flight then he goes dark.
3629277 3632280 I think it's time we had a chat<br />with John Knox.
3632280 3634674 Go pick him up,<br />but bring him in voluntarily.
3634674 3636458 We got nothing<br />to hold him as a suspect.
3636458 3637634 All right.
3798229 3800666 Do you know what electives<br />you're gonna take this year?
3801710 3803887 Did you get your syllabus?
3803887 3806759 Yeah, I actually ended up<br />getting a class with Michelles.
3806759 3807847 Mhm!
3810937 3812330 [customer] I got<br />a pick-up order for Anthony.
3821948 3824429 I-I just think that it might be<br />too much this year.
3824429 3826518 - [customer] Thanks.<br />- Very good.
3826518 3827954 I'm still gonna do soccer.<br />I think...
3827954 3829564 - Hey, excuse me.<br />- [customer] Yeah.
3829564 3830652 I saw you<br />looking at my daughter.
3830652 3831958 [customer] Do I know you?
3831958 3833438 - No.<br />- [woman] Hey! Oh, my God!
3833438 3834656 - [Miles] Fuck you!<br />- [muffled yelling]
3842099 3843883 [knocking]
3850107 3851673 John Knox?
3851673 3853762 Johnny Law.
3853762 3856896 We got something going on<br />we'd like to get your help with.
3856896 3859594 If you could come with us.<br />Voluntarily.
3859594 3860813 [Knox] Sure.
3860813 3862423 Why not? It's my day off.
3862423 3864556 I'll grab a jacket<br />and I'll follow you down.
3864556 3866471 Or we could follow you down.
3867864 3869169 Better. [clicks tongue]
3869169 3870605 [chuckles]
3874087 3877525 She's on my policy. I told you,<br />and I told the last person.
3878918 3880746 It was pre-approved.
3880746 3882530 Her doctor faxed it in.
3882530 3884924 You know, we go<br />through the same fuck...
3884924 3886970 damn thing every month.
3886970 3888667 D-don't put me on hold.
3892279 3893411 [knocking]
3894586 3896501 We got Knox set up<br />in Interview Two.
3899460 3901636 Anything on the other case?<br />Homer?
3901636 3904988 the prints we found don't<br />match anything on the system.
3904988 3906380 The ME confirmed<br />that there were
3906380 3908078 two blood types<br />on the scene,
3908078 3909427 but hadn't had time to run<br />DNA sequencing to look
3909427 3911298 for a match on the second guy.
3916477 3917783 It's always "guys" with you.
3919611 3922179 - Eh?<br />- You said "the second guy."
3922179 3923789 You also said the gate card
3923789 3926009 was grabbed from behind<br />by "the guy,"
3926009 3927706 even though he never saw<br />his attacker.
3927706 3929490 It's always "guys" with you.
3929490 3932624 Fine. The ME has not had time<br />to run DNA sequencing
3932624 3935453 to look for a match on the<br />second them, they or their.
3935453 3937716 - Is that better?<br />- Welcome to the 21st century.
3937716 3939152 [whispering] Oh, my God.
3950424 3952339 Detective. How can I help you?
3953427 3955125 Save it for the tape.
3956996 3958998 Detective Emily Ikari,
3958998 3962219 interviewing potential<br />material witness, John Knox.
3962219 3965091 Case number 52698.
3966266 3970053 Interview is voluntary.<br />Commencing at 10:46 a.m.
3971184 3973186 Ah... please state your name<br />for the record.
3974013 3975362 John Knox.
3975362 3977234 Ah, full legal.<br />Need the middle name.
3985633 3986939 It's not a trick question.
3986939 3988636 - [chuckles]<br />- Those come later.
3989550 3990812 John Henry Knox.
3994512 3996296 Okay. I don't know<br />what game this is,
3996296 3997471 but let's move on.
3999430 4002433 You said something about...
4002433 4004217 me being a witness?
4004217 4007525 I hope so. I'm working<br />on the death of your partner.
4007525 4010528 - I don't have a partner.<br />- Not anymore.
4010528 4012399 If you're referring<br />to Thomas Muncie,
4012399 4013661 he was an acquaintance.
4013661 4015446 We never did any work together.
4015446 4018884 I've been over the crime scene<br />a dozen times. Ah...
4018884 4020364 let me tell you<br />what I think happened.
4020364 4021452 Sure.
4022366 4024803 There were three dead bodies<br />in that room,
4024803 4026457 all shot with the same gun,
4026457 4028328 and staged to look<br />like they killed each other.
4029503 4032028 But... it was clumsy.
4032028 4035292 Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.
4035292 4039078 I think someone<br />killed Muncie by mistake
4039078 4040949 and tried to stage it<br />to cover it up.
4044518 4047347 Did you say Ikari?
4047347 4049915 Are you related to Peter Ikari?
4052439 4054441 - That's my father.<br />- [Knox] Oh, hell.
4055529 4057096 I know Pete.
4057096 4058706 Get him in here.<br />I'll talk to him.
4058706 4060186 You know my father?
4061187 4064147 I just talked to him...<br />couple days ago.
4064147 4066018 He used to patrol<br />my neighborhood.
4067324 4068977 Mr. Knox, my father is dead.
4070936 4071980 What?
4074679 4076115 What happened?
4076115 4078030 He was shot in the line of duty.
4078030 4079118 Twelve years ago.
4081860 4083383 Where are you going<br />with all this?
4090390 4091609 [sighs]
4091609 4092697 Look.
4094786 4097005 As far<br />as the Muncie murder goes,
4097005 4098833 I wasn't there.
4098833 4101706 And if you had anything<br />to suggest that I was,
4101706 4104883 I'd be doing this interview<br />in a jumpsuit right now.
4104883 4107799 So, as far as you're concerned,
4107799 4109757 I'm Schrodinger's murderer.
4109757 4110845 Schro-what now?
4111890 4112934 At this moment...
4115763 4120159 I both did<br />and did not kill Muncie.
4120159 4122248 And with that,<br />I'm gonna get going.
4122248 4123728 What's your hurry?
4125121 4128254 I'm gonna be going away soon.
4128254 4131214 And before I do,<br />there are some things...
4131214 4132606 I better put right.
4132606 4135522 Interview suspended 10:52 a.m.
4138569 4140266 What in the fuck was that?
4140266 4141485 I don't know.
4141485 4143400 Strange fucking tactics.
4143400 4144749 So what's our next move?
4144749 4146707 Not sure.
4146707 4148013 How about we catch<br />our other killer
4148013 4149188 while I mull it over?
4165944 4166988 "Walker."
4168990 4170557 Walker. John Walker.
4173343 4174387 Damnit.
4196975 4198194 [knocking]
4202285 4203329 [knocking]
4258993 4260038 Miles?
4291896 4293114 John?
4296379 4297771 What's with the chrome?
4297771 4299207 What? Are you gonna shoot me?
4299991 4301732 The hell are you doing<br />in my kitchen?
4302776 4304648 Can't believe the key<br />is in the same spot.
4304648 4307433 - Let me get those groceries.<br />- No, no, no, no, no. No.
4307433 4309130 Don't touch the groceries.
4310436 4312090 What are you doing here?
4316355 4317356 I'm here.
4328280 4329325 Hey, I'm...
4332110 4333154 cashing out.
4334417 4335766 So there's gonna be...
4335766 4337724 gonna be some money<br />coming your way.
4337724 4341989 [groans]<br />I don't want your money.
4341989 4343991 Let's... let's skip the part
4343991 4345689 where you pretend<br />you don't and...
4345689 4347647 I pretend to talk you into it.
4353000 4354045 [sighs]
4362445 4363750 Why are you cashing out?
4366100 4367145 Going away.
4369408 4370453 Of course you are.
4373978 4376110 I meant what I said<br />about the money.
4376110 4377938 I never wanted<br />anything from you...
4379331 4380419 except for you.
4382943 4385337 But I guess we both knew<br />that was too much to ask.
4395913 4396957 Yeah.
4401484 4403311 So, anyway. Uhm...
4405139 4408752 I need you to make sure<br />Miles takes his share.
4408752 4410754 That's... [chuckles]
4412495 4413496 That's harder.
4414714 4415759 [clears her throat]
4418196 4419893 Miles is harder.
4419893 4423201 Yeah. And have him...
4424855 4426378 So he can put...
4426378 4427771 ah... the girl...
4428815 4429860 She can go...
4430687 4431775 Go to the, uh...
4433864 4434908 You know.
4435779 4436910 [sighs]
4436910 4437998 Goddammit.
4439435 4440436 The big school.
4442002 4443743 - College.<br />- [Knox] Yeah.
4443743 4445571 Yeah, uh...
4445571 4447791 Yeah.
4447791 4449401 I mean, you know,
4449401 4451621 something good has to come out<br />of all this.
4451621 4453492 How long you going away for?
4454450 4456103 There's no coming back<br />from this one.
4463110 4465504 They finally caught up<br />to you, uh?
4465504 4467332 You must be slipping.
4468855 4470422 Yeah.
4470422 4471858 [snorts]
4471858 4473033 Yeah, you could say that.
4487483 4488919 So, anyway...
4490747 4492226 yeah.
4492226 4493358 Okay.
4495360 4496404 All right.
4501975 4503542 [exhales]
4503542 4504630 Knox...
4506284 4510114 I still love you. Just a little.
4510114 4511550 As much as I hate you,
4511550 4512899 I wouldn't want to shoot you,<br />so...
4514553 4515815 call ahead next time.
4517687 4518731 [Knox] Yeah.
4520167 4521604 There isn't gonna be<br />a next time.
4568476 4570566 [Ruby distorted] <i>You must be<br />slipping.</i>
4579444 4581141 [distorted] <i>But I guess<br />we both know</i>
4581141 4582403 <i>that was too much to ask.</i>
4589236 4591064 [Annie muffled] Knox.
4591064 4592196 [mumbling] Fucking...
4592196 4593371 [muffled] John?
4593371 4595721 Sorry. Am I early?
4603250 4604600 No, uh...
4605992 4608821 I was just gonna... why don't I<br />jump in the shower?
4608821 4612346 Let's have a drink first.<br />I'll make you one for once.
4617351 4620528 I wasn't sure you'd want me here<br />after last time.
4620528 4622139 Why? What happened last time?
4626056 4628232 You got me worried, Knox.
4628232 4629407 Jesus, Ruby!
4629407 4631235 Don't worry about it.
4631235 4634412 I just gotta get a handle<br />on this last part of this thing.
4634412 4636980 How is the cash out coming?
4636980 4638721 I got the paintings<br />and I got the cash,
4638721 4640679 I just have<br />to get the stones here tonight.
4640679 4641985 The stones?
4641985 4644509 Yeah, the stones.
4644509 4645858 And then I gotta take them<br />to my guy.
4645858 4647512 He turns everything<br />into clean cash.
4648252 4650210 Then I just have to...
4650210 4651908 cut it into thirds.
4651908 4653039 [Annie] Why thirds?
4653997 4656477 Only got three people<br />on the list. You're on the list.
4660264 4662222 I don't even<br />look like her, Knox.
4671492 4673494 Here's<br />to every Thursday afternoon.
4698476 4699651 You just get a hand job?
4701435 4703002 Better.
4703002 4705439 You're not gonna believe<br />what Tech just found.
4705439 4707441 - So tell me.<br />- No!
4707441 4710314 No. You gotta hear this<br />for yourself. Come on!
4710314 4712403 [Heather] <i>Okay,</i>
4712403 4713839 everything we thought we'd find
4713839 4714884 based on his previous<br />arrest record.
4714884 4716755 Oh, God.
4716755 4718322 [Heather] But where
4718322 4719410 it gets interesting<br />is in his live chats.
4719410 4720759 He was communicating
4720759 4721891 with half a dozen<br />young teen girls.
4721891 4723457 Convincing them to send nudes.
4723457 4725155 When we get the guy<br />who killed this asshole,
4725155 4726547 - we should give him a medal.<br />- First we let him loose
4726547 4727635 on a few other guys<br />I can think of.
4727635 4729028 It's always guys with you.
4729028 4730203 [Heather] There's one girl
4730203 4731770 he talked to for over a year,
4731770 4733511 but then they actually started<br />to meet up IRL.
4733511 4735426 IRL?
4735426 4737080 [Heather] In real life.
4737080 4739735 So say that.
4739735 4742215 [Heather] They definitely<br />had sex.
4742215 4744174 A lot of sex.<br />They talked about it.
4744174 4745653 Extensively.
4745653 4746872 Anybody got a Tums?
4749832 4752617 Anyway, I was able to trace<br />her IP address.
4752617 4754271 She's a 16-year-old girl
4754271 4757056 in Silver Lake by the name<br />of Kaylee Iris Knox.
4757056 4758623 Okay.
4758623 4760407 Let's talk<br />to her and her parents.
4761539 4762845 Wait.
4762845 4764063 You said "Knox"?
4764063 4766631 I ran the family.
4766631 4768764 It's John Knox's granddaughter.
4805496 4806976 [glass crashing]
4877437 4880745 I'm sorry. Why do you want<br />to talk to our daughter?
4880745 4883791 Ah... we just have<br />a few questions for Kaylee.
4883791 4885228 And for your husband.
4885228 4886316 You guys are gonna be<br />right in here.
4888622 4890537 Oh, Mr. Knox.
4890537 4891712 Actually, we're gonna put you<br />in this room right over here.
4891712 4893236 [chuckles]
4893236 4894324 Hang on a second.
4896587 4898894 Just be honest, okay?<br />Tell the truth.
4903724 4906466 Detective Ikari is gonna be<br />right with you.
4914387 4915432 [door closing]
4937019 4938281 [distorted sound]
4940413 4941806 [distorted sound]
4986068 4987765 [Miles, distorted]<br /><i>Like, what if I did?</i>
4997340 4999429 [pants]
5009700 5011223 [Ikari] Detective Emily Ikari,
5011223 5013008 interviewing Miles Knox.<br />It is...
5014139 5015662 4:37 p.m.
5018143 5019275 Andrew Palmer.
5021494 5023061 What?
5023061 5025324 Pretty sure you know who he is.
5025324 5027500 I thought this was<br />about the fight at the café.
5027500 5029633 What fight at what café?
5033724 5034768 Okay...
5036292 5037771 What about that prick?
5037771 5039860 We know<br />what happened between you.
5039860 5041297 You called them?
5041297 5042689 You said you wouldn't call them.
5042689 5044387 - No, we didn't.<br />- No. You promised
5044387 5045866 if I went to the clinic,<br />you wouldn't tell on him.
5045866 5046954 Honey...
5046954 5048086 Kaylee, Kaylee.
5048086 5049609 Your parents didn't call us.
5049609 5051307 Neither your mom or your dad.
5051307 5053265 What's this about, then?<br />What do you want to know?
5053265 5056268 We found chats on his computer<br />between him and your daughter.
5056268 5059445 We're pretty sure<br />you know what's going on.
5059445 5061056 We know that he raped you.
5062057 5063101 [angry snort]
5063101 5065190 H-he... he didn't rape me.
5068019 5069803 Did you arrest him?
5069803 5072763 No. He... he's not<br />in any trouble with the law.
5072763 5074286 Well, if you're asking me
5074286 5075418 if I want to press charges,<br />I don't wanna--
5075418 5076854 [Ikari] It's too late for that.
5076854 5077942 He's dead.
5082033 5083078 Good.
5084166 5086646 Was it an accident?<br />'Cause I hope he suffered.
5086646 5087952 I wanna show you something.
5091173 5092261 [Ikari clears her throat]
5092261 5093566 See that there?
5093566 5095568 That's your car.
5095568 5098658 Driving into the gated<br />neighborhood where Palmer lives.
5098658 5100356 This is about 20 minutes later.
5101705 5104011 See by the timestamp. See?
5104011 5105709 That's you, no doubt.
5105709 5107754 Yeah, that's me.
5107754 5109713 Yeah, I went to see him.<br />So what?
5109713 5112846 So, somewhere<br />in this time frame,
5112846 5114979 Palmer was stabbed to death<br />in his kitchen.
5114979 5116633 Wow. You can narrow the<br />time of death
5116633 5118113 to 20 minutes?
5118113 5119418 Modern science.
5119418 5120506 This is the part<br />where you tell me
5120506 5121638 you just went to warn him
5121638 5122987 to stay away from your daughter?
5122987 5124554 Yeah, it's exactly right.
5124554 5126164 And I might have punched him.
5126164 5127296 [Ikari] Mhm...
5127948 5129820 How did you cut your hand there?
5129820 5131387 On a glass.
5131387 5132997 We're gonna find<br />that glass in your house?
5132997 5134651 No, I was at...
5134651 5137001 What do you mean at my house?
5137001 5139090 Based on this video,
5139090 5141440 we obtained a warrant<br />for your house and your car.
5141440 5142702 They're being searched now.
5146010 5148055 I'm not gonna say another word<br />until my attorney gets here.
5148055 5150319 And that goes<br />for my underaged daughter.
5150319 5153060 Stop talking to her. Right now.
5153060 5154149 [sighs]
5164289 5165508 [muffled] You all right?
5168511 5169642 Hey, man. Are you okay?
5175082 5176258 Yeah.
5176258 5178216 [Ikari] <i>We got you.</i>
5178216 5179348 Do you, now?
5179348 5180958 Don't say anything.
5180958 5182089 [Ikari] Sure.
5182089 5184222 I'll do the talking.
5184222 5185963 Show you what we found?
5190881 5192361 Your bloody clothes found
5192361 5194711 in a dumpster<br />behind your apartment.
5194711 5196539 What? Bullshit.
5196539 5198236 The murder weapon...
5198236 5201370 hidden in a heating vent<br />in your apartment.
5201370 5202936 No, no.<br />Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5202936 5205330 - That's not right.<br />- Miles, stop talking.
5205330 5208028 The knife has prints<br />all over it.
5208028 5209595 We'll be pulling yours<br />for comparison
5209595 5211249 in about five minutes.
5211249 5214252 Me? I'm confident.
5214252 5217864 Long, blonde hair recovered<br />from the lapel of your coat.
5217864 5220127 Would you wanna bet<br />it matches the victim?
5220127 5222260 Don't speak.
5222260 5226395 Miles Knox, I'm arresting you<br />for the murder of Andrew Palmer.
5226395 5228527 You have the right<br />to remain silent.
5228527 5230225 Anything you say<br />can be held against you
5230225 5231617 in a court of law.
5232401 5234664 [Philo] Here, a little coin<br />for your trouble.
5234664 5236927 [man] I'm good. I'm glad<br />you guys showed up.
5236927 5238015 Take care of him.
5238015 5239103 [Philo] Thank you.
5241758 5244239 All kinds of people<br />make this world, don't they?
5248939 5250157 Okay, pal.
5251637 5253683 How are you even here?
5253683 5256686 I'm the last person<br />you called, see?
5256686 5259254 Give Ludmilla your keys.<br />She'll drive your Caddy back.
5259254 5261386 I can drive my own car.
5261386 5262953 [Ludmilla] It's right<br />around the corner.
5262953 5264128 50 meters away. Come.
5267262 5268785 [Gelfuso] Hey,<br />congrats on the arrest.
5268785 5270569 Thanks.
5270569 5271962 I found out why Knox went<br />to San Francisco.
5271962 5273964 He was there to see a doctor.
5273964 5276096 !Ah... Doctor...
5276096 5277489 Frederick Burns.
5278751 5280231 [Ikari] The neurologist?
5280231 5281319 How do you know that?
5282538 5283930 [Gelfuso] Obviously,
5283930 5285497 I couldn't get<br />any medical records,
5285497 5287282 but the guy specializes<br />in treating dementia.
5289109 5290807 Okay. Good work.
5290807 5291938 Thank you.
5294767 5297030 Did you at least<br />get what you came for?
5299468 5301513 Yeah... yeah.
5308694 5310696 Xavier...
5310696 5312132 I can only remember about...
5313220 5316093 Three hours of today.
5316093 5318138 It's like a curtain coming down.
5322099 5323405 That's rough.
5326146 5327191 Why me?
5328410 5330150 I mean, you know.
5330150 5333415 Trained killer, Army,<br />and all that, I know, but...
5333415 5334807 Why'd you pull me in?
5338071 5341814 That brain of yours.
5341814 5343338 I knew you'd understand
5343338 5344730 the training<br />I was putting you through.
5346558 5347907 You know, in all this time...
5347907 5349474 [Philo] Mhm?
5349474 5351955 Never left a print behind,<br />no DNA, nothing.
5351955 5354174 [Philo] Mmm...
5354174 5356612 I learned from the master.
5356612 5358135 What's your count, anyway?
5358135 5359702 [Knox] Two.
5359702 5360833 Two?
5362487 5363706 Come on.
5363706 5365577 The cabbie in Chicago and...
5366796 5368275 a woman in the shower.
5371931 5374020 Two civilians. Fuck.
5375631 5376675 You know...
5377676 5380113 Muncie...
5380113 5383900 he liked to talk<br />about the targets, you know.
5383900 5385641 Pimps, drug dealers, traffickers.
5386859 5387904 Yeah.
5388992 5390385 I think it made him feel better.
5392038 5394214 He never got what it was...
5394214 5395520 really all about.
5396913 5398044 Which was?
5398044 5400917 Guys caught behind enemy lines.
5400917 5402048 That's all.
5406226 5408011 So...
5408011 5410927 We only have two steps left.
5410927 5412711 [sighs]
5412711 5415845 Your visit and my call.
5415845 5417194 Visit and a call.
5418891 5421285 Visit and the call,<br />visit and the call.
5421285 5422634 I can do that.
5422634 5424506 Keep the notes in your pocket.
5425855 5428771 I'll remind you when to go.
5430512 5431774 You'll be done
5431774 5432862 tomorrow.
5437649 5439390 I'm scared.
5439390 5440913 Yeah
5440913 5442001 I figured.
5458365 5459889 Hey...
5459889 5462674 I need you to do<br />one more thing for me.
5462674 5464415 Finish my cash out.
5464415 5466504 Take my stuff to Philo.
5466504 5469202 You wanna put me<br />in charge of your money?
5469202 5470726 You know I'm a thief.
5470726 5472336 You're not gonna steal from me.
5472336 5474077 No...
5474077 5475513 Probably not.
5475513 5477689 Wait here. I'll bring it out.
5477689 5479038 Okay, yeah.
5491616 5492922 [door opening]
5544800 5545844 [chuckles]
5552721 5554940 I'm sorry, Knox.
5554940 5556028 It's a lot of money.
5559597 5560642 Can't argue with that.
5564820 5566952 - Now what?<br />- Get the stones.
5566952 5568040 Ah...
5570477 5572044 Easy, easy, easy.
5574873 5576179 [speaks foreign language]
5591150 5592630 [man] Where you going, huh?
5592630 5594284 Eh? [groans]
5595938 5599855 [groans]
5599855 5602074 [groans and coughs]
5616698 5617742 [gunshots]
5622094 5623139 [gunshots]
5623139 5625489 [sobs]
5637675 5638676 Knox...
5642724 5644595 How were you gonna<br />split the take?
5645901 5647206 Four equal shares.
5648120 5649165 [snorts]
5650296 5651689 That's funny?
5651689 5652864 [Knox] Yeah, it is.
5655606 5656912 You were gonna get a third.
5658304 5659349 [Annie] What?
5660872 5662439 You were one of the three.
5663919 5665703 You're thinking of your ex-wife.
5665703 5667096 [Knox] No, Annie.
5667096 5668184 It was you.
5670708 5674016 My Thursday afternoon date<br />for the last four years.
5675626 5678455 My ex-wife, my son...
5679456 5680500 and you.
5682589 5683721 All you had to do...
5685636 5686681 was nothing.
5698170 5700607 [currency-counting machine]
5700607 5702522 He wants to make<br />a change to the list.
5702522 5704786 Take off the last name,<br />the hooker.
5704786 5707092 No problemo.
5707092 5710269 You split it even, fifty-fifty,<br />between the wife and the son.
5710269 5712184 Carve out something for you?
5712184 5713925 No, I'm good.
5713925 5716188 [currency-counting machine]
5735773 5737514 What the hell, Dad?
5737514 5739342 I don't understand why you'd--
5739342 5741692 - Wait, wait, wait. Stop.<br />- [Miles] I don't understand...
5741692 5743302 Stop. Just listen to me.
5743302 5745130 I'm so confused.
5745130 5746523 I went to you for help.
5746523 5749874 Why? Why would you<br />do this to me?
5749874 5752268 You're the reason<br />I went to prison.
5754226 5755358 I'm what?
5755358 5756663 [Knox] The tax evasion thing.
5757316 5759928 You're the one<br />who ratted me out.
5759928 5761843 What the hell? I didn't know<br />anything about you back then.
5761843 5765281 I did six years because of you.
5765281 5768023 No, no. That's not true.
5768023 5769589 That's not true, Dad.
5769589 5771113 Listen to me.<br />I think you're losing it.
5771113 5772810 Something's wrong with you.<br />Why would...
5772810 5774159 Why would you<br />think I would do that?
5774159 5775247 Look at me.
5776945 5777989 It was you.
5780339 5781819 You turned me in.
5781819 5784169 I did not! I didn't do it, Dad!
5784169 5787259 That's not true!<br />Dad, listen to me! Listen to me!
5787259 5789392 [muffled] Dad! Goddammit!
5789392 5790785 Listen to me!
5790785 5793265 Why would I do that<br />even if I knew!
5793265 5794353 You're wrong!
5803014 5804624 - Hey, Ikari.<br />- What?
5804624 5806322 There's a problem<br />with the Palmer evidence.
5806322 5809455 - Which evidence?<br />- All of it.
5809455 5812328 It's a first. There is a problem<br />with the blood on the clothes.
5812328 5814156 Evidence of Erythromycin.
5814156 5817202 That's a molecular breakdown<br />consistent with freezing.
5817202 5821554 The blood on the clothes was<br />frozen for at least 12 hours
5821554 5823687 before it was thawed<br />and put on the fabric.
5824601 5825994 Put?
5825994 5827560 Yeah. Same with the knife.
5827560 5829388 Wait... that's not<br />the murder weapon?
5829388 5831738 No, it definitely is,<br />and the blood is the victim's.
5831738 5833610 The issue is<br />with the fingerprints.
5833610 5835003 No. I saw the comparison.
5835003 5836221 They matched<br />Miles Knox's prints,
5836221 5837788 no question.
5837788 5839659 Yes, but they contained<br />traces of monomers.
5839659 5841879 Butyl acrylate<br />and methyl methacrylate.
5841879 5842880 Packing tape.
5843620 5845927 Also, some sort<br />of household spice.
5845927 5847406 I'm sorry, detective.
5847406 5849060 The prints on the knife<br />were planted.
5849060 5850453 Planted?
5851454 5852934 Christ...
5852934 5854849 And then, there's the hair<br />from the coat.
5854849 5856241 It's really impossible
5856241 5857373 that this was<br />the only thing we found.
5857373 5859505 I've been over this three times.
5859505 5862334 In my opinion, this jacket<br />was never anywhere
5862334 5863770 near the crime scene.
5863770 5865468 But we have the video.
5865468 5868384 [Heather] Yeah... about that...
5868384 5869472 Fuck me!
5874172 5877393 [phone vibrating]
5877393 5878785 Hey.
5878785 5880875 You're almost home.
5880875 5882354 One more step.
5882354 5883529 Okay.
5884617 5886881 [Philo] <i>I'm gonna<br />make the call.</i>
5886881 5888621 You just sit tight.
5888621 5891146 Oh, did you get rid<br />of the notebook?
5891146 5892321 Yeah, I did.
5892321 5894062 Because this all goes to hell
5894062 5895324 if they find the notebook.
5895324 5896934 You understand?
5896934 5898327 It's gone.
5898327 5899502 [Philo] <i>What did you do<br />with it?</i>
5899502 5900590 I burned it.
5900590 5901896 Okay.
5902505 5904550 I'll make the call<br />and it's over.
5904550 5906552 Yeah, good.
5906552 5908511 Hey, eh... X.
5909642 5911383 You should...
5911383 5914734 probably tell her I got<br />three dead bodies over here.
5914734 5917650 Do you have...<br />three dead bodies in there?
5917650 5919043 [Knox] <i>I do.</i>
5919043 5920349 - Three?<br /><i>- </i> [Knox] <i>Three.</i>
5923482 5924962 Oh, John.
5924962 5926050 Yeah.
5926877 5927922 Listen...
5932187 5933231 Good luck.
5937279 5938758 [Heather] It's<br />almost imperceptible
5938758 5939846 to the naked eye,
5939846 5941761 but there's a jump there.
5941761 5944068 And if you go<br />into the root file,
5944068 5945635 someone clearly deleted
5945635 5947245 the original timestamp<br />and wrote over it.
5947245 5949073 Hard to spot, but it's there.
5949073 5950988 Meaning what?
5950988 5952555 He could have driven
5952555 5954165 in-and-out of the gate<br />on any day, at any time.
5954165 5956254 The footage was<br />simply spliced in.
5961738 5963479 Miles Knox was framed?
5963479 5965002 It's what it looks like.
5965002 5967657 It doesn't add up.<br />Nothing makes sense.
5967657 5969180 Detective Ikari.
5969180 5970703 - Not now.<br />- There's a phone call for you.
5970703 5972792 - I said not now!<br />- [officer] Okay, but...
5972792 5974229 This guy says<br />it has something to do
5974229 5975273 with John Knox.
5976448 5978189 This is detective Ikari.
5978189 5980365 <i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>
5980365 5982498 You should get up<br />to his bungalow
5982498 5984456 Why the hell would I do that?
5984456 5987024 [Philo] <i>He's got<br />three dead bodies in there.</i>
5987024 5989070 [Ikari] <i>Who is this?</i>
5989070 5991376 An anonymous, concerned citizen.
6003562 6004911 Don't move! Do not move!
6006652 6008219 [officer, muffled] God bodies.
6008219 6010134 [echoing] What happened?
6011353 6013007 Jesus, Knox.
6013007 6014486 Put your hands<br />behind your back.
6014486 6015618 All right.
6019013 6020014 [officer] Let's go.
6023626 6025323 Hey, hey! Ikari!
6025323 6026542 You're gonna want<br />to check this out.
6037727 6039381 Why would he...?
6039381 6040556 What the hell is this?
6041339 6042384 What?
6047519 6048607 [sighs]
6048607 6049956 Jesus Christ.
6052263 6054700 It was him.
6054700 6056398 [woman] My client won't be<br />making any statements.
6056398 6058269 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'll do the talking again.
6058835 6060054 You can wait outside.
6062447 6063840 So, Miles.
6065494 6067496 We know you didn't kill<br />Andrew Palmer.
6069106 6071630 - What?<br />- [Ikari] You're in the clear.
6071630 6073328 We're dropping all the charges.
6073328 6074938 You'll walk out of here<br />in half an hour a free man.
6074938 6077680 But first, tell me again<br />how you cut your hand.
6079508 6080552 On a broken glass.
6081466 6082859 [Ikari] Where?
6082859 6084469 At my father's house.
6084469 6085862 Why were you there?
6085862 6087081 [Lawyer] Don't say anything.
6095132 6097700 At least...<br />tell me about your dad.
6097700 6099310 In general terms.
6099310 6100485 - [Lawyer] Don't.<br />- Wait.
6104185 6105360 In general terms?
6108319 6109755 A lousy jerk.
6109755 6111670 And a hothead?
6111670 6113759 [Miles] Yeah, that's right.<br />He's abusive.
6113759 6116414 He's a despicable human being.
6116414 6118024 [Ikari] See, I get that.
6118024 6119939 But how big a prick<br />do you need to be...
6121506 6123247 to frame your own son<br />for murder?
6127469 6128905 I don't follow.
6128905 6130602 I got all the evidence.
6130602 6133214 Everything he used to frame you<br />was in his house.
6133214 6135912 He planted your prints<br />on the murder weapon,
6135912 6137522 hid it in your wall,
6137522 6139307 put the victim's blood<br />on your clothes,
6139307 6141526 his hair on your clothes.
6141526 6143137 Put your blood
6143137 6144442 from that broken glass<br />at the murder scene.
6144442 6145661 Why would he do that?
6146966 6148577 Why does he hate you so much?
6156672 6157803 'Cause I turned him in.
6159327 6160893 What do you mean?
6160893 6162112 [Miles] The tax case<br />he went to prison for.
6162852 6164593 I was the one<br />who called the IRS.
6164593 6166029 [Ikari] Mhm... no.
6166029 6167117 The file says that was<br />someone named--
6167117 6168292 File's wrong.
6169380 6170425 It was me.
6187920 6190184 [cell opening]
6190184 6192534 We never could tie<br />that gun to you.
6192534 6194188 Looks like you got away<br />with that one.
6196494 6197930 But just between us...
6199802 6202239 tell me.
6202239 6203980 It was you who shot Muncie,<br />wasn't it?
6213119 6214208 Muncie coming?
6215426 6216514 Muncie is dead.
6217428 6218734 You killed him.
6222607 6224000 They have newspapers here.
6224000 6225480 Muncie likes<br />to read the newspaper.
6235838 6236969 [phone rattling]
6239668 6241496 [guard] 0-5-2-3!
6241496 6242888 [buzzing]
6245151 6246240 Sorry.
6249068 6250113 He's not doing well.
6252463 6254030 Why do you wanna see him?
6254030 6255684 He tried to frame you.
6255684 6257294 Yeah, I mean...
6257294 6259775 He still killed the man<br />who raped my daughter.
6259775 6262386 And that's okay<br />with you? Murder?
6262386 6264910 If I could, I'd dig Palmer up<br />and I'd kill him again.
6267348 6270960 By the way, they're moving him<br />to a medical facility tomorrow.
6270960 6272657 I tried to get<br />a move sooner, but...
6273745 6274877 bureaucracy.
6277227 6278663 He went so fast, didn't he?
6279969 6281275 Fortunately for you.
6282580 6283929 How do you mean?
6283929 6285931 If he hadn't been<br />losing his mind,
6285931 6288020 he might have gotten away<br />with framing you.
6288020 6289152 Lucky for me, then.
6291981 6293025 Yeah.
6299554 6300729 [buzzing]
6319835 6321663 Hey, Dad.
6321663 6322751 Is it Sunday?
6324361 6327059 No, no. It's not.
6327059 6328322 It's Wednesday, Dad.
6329845 6331107 - Why?<br />- Well...
6333544 6334850 My son likes football.
6337679 6338723 Is that so?
6338723 6339811 [Knox] Yeah.
6342336 6344338 Sometimes we go<br />to the Rose Bowl.
6349299 6350996 I bet he loves that.
6350996 6352389 - [Knox] Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
6354435 6355436 But...
6357612 6358656 [sobs]
6362704 6364706 [sighs]
6364706 6365794 [Knox muttering] Sunday...
6368536 6369580 I love you, Dad.
6378067 6379111 Yeah.
6438519 6439911 [unintelligible conversation]
6439911 6440999 [Kaylee giggling]
6451140 6453316 - [Miles] Who wants to get beat?<br />- I don't know it.
