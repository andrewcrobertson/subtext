129177 130787 Cassie, can I have some coffee?
130787 131875 Okay.
135227 137533 You heard about this broad<br />out in Weasley?
137533 141711 Oh, old-school,<br />newspaper, I like it.
141711 144366 Yeah... You know, the news<br />does come on your phone now,
144366 145759 it's a new thing.
145759 147848 Says the man<br />with ten thousand books.
147848 149676 Hmm. Thank you.
149676 152896 Makes her husband breakfast,<br />for 35 years.
152896 156857 One day, she starts putting<br />a little bit of antifreeze
156857 158815 on his orange juice<br />every morning.
158815 160643 Why, was he cold?
162863 165518 What we got here?
165518 169696 Oh... "Empiricism<br />and the Philosophy of Mind".
169696 171698 Bunch of crock.
174135 175876 Wilfrid Sellars wrote this?
175876 179575 Yeah, interesting guy.<br />You know Wilfrid Sellars?
179575 181229 No, but I know Peter Sellars.
181229 183100 Okay...
185929 188584 It took this guy eight months<br />to die from the antifreeze.
189890 191631 That's dedication.
191631 193850 You gotta give her points<br />for tenacity.
193850 196331 Come on. Eight months?
196331 198638 Can you imagine hating<br />anyone that much?
198638 201945 Honestly? I can think<br />of a few candidates, yeah.
201945 203120 How did they catch her?
203120 205253 Mmm... doesn't say.
205253 207821 Maybe they...
207821 209257 Maybe when they tried<br />to embalm the guy,
209257 211259 the formaldehyde wouldn't set.
211259 214262 "I pumped two barrels<br />of that shit into him
214262 215916 and it keeps leaking out."
215916 217787 Put him in the deep freeze<br />and he's still warm.
217787 221269 That's good, that's good.
221269 224185 - Thank you.<br />- Hi there, Cassie.
224185 227144 Cassie, can I get a coffee?
227144 228233 Already got you.
229669 232846 I guess I need it.
236023 237677 You're such a skinny dude.
237677 240157 Where you put all that?
240157 243117 My old man said I have<br />a hollow cock.
243117 244988 Really?
244988 247948 Your father said that,<br />"hollow cock". Interesting.
247948 250037 Yeah, he's a philosopher, too.
256348 259307 I'm going to go<br />right to the airport from here.
259307 261788 I have to go out of town<br />for a couple of days.
261788 263485 - You? What for?<br />- Yeah.
263485 265618 Personal stuff, no big deal.
265618 266836 I'll be back the day<br />after tomorrow.
266836 268708 Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.
269926 271537 - Personal?<br />- Yeah.
271537 273016 Good.
273800 276324 Because if Jericho found out<br />you went out of town on a job...
276324 278239 Give me a little credit,<br />I don't have a death wish.
278239 279980 Then why are you even going?
279980 282243 Like I said, personal.
282243 283853 No big deal.
283853 286508 I'll be back tomorrow.
286508 287944 Okay.<br />Yeah.
299173 300305 Are you okay?
301393 303046 Good.
303046 304309 Okay...
306441 307964 I'm going to get the check.
307964 310271 The check? We just got<br />the plate of food.
310271 312055 I know but I...
312055 313535 don't want to be late,<br />I have to get to the airport.
313535 315537 You got five minutes<br />to eat some food.
315537 317017 Hurry up,<br />take five minutes.
317017 318279 Jesus Christ...
320977 323937 All right, anything<br />comes up, call me.
323937 325460 What the hell?
325460 327288 When did you get the new car?
327288 330073 Oh... Eh... Oh.
333599 336558 So, you're not even going to<br />tell me where you're going now.
336558 338386 I'll tell you when I come back.
345175 346220 Apple.
348788 349832 Dog.
358145 359364 Ehm...
366458 367502 Car.
404017 405061 How are you today?
406280 409196 Well... you tell me.
409196 413461 My initial suspicions<br />were incorrect.
413461 414984 It's not Alzheimer's.
416856 418510 Okay.
418510 420903 What is it?
420903 422339 You're suffering<br />from a condition
422339 424254 known as<br />Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
424254 427606 It presents initially in much<br />the same way as Alzheimer's.
427606 429042 So, what's the difference?
429042 430260 Speed of progression.
433350 437093 I'm guessing...<br />you don't mean it's slower.
439400 441141 In your case,<br />it's incredibly fast.
446886 448278 What's the treatment?
448278 449410 There's no treatment.
452674 456069 The thing you have to<br />remember about dementia
456069 458724 is the thought-feeling<br />connection.
458724 460943 You have a thought,<br />creates a feeling.
460943 464164 You lose a thought,<br />you're left with a feeling.
464164 467254 So, you'll be going along and...
467254 469038 all of a sudden,
469038 471258 you'll be unreasonably happy<br />and you won't know why.
471258 474566 Or you'll have<br />this wave of depression
474566 476568 and you won't know why.
476568 480397 You'll find yourself...<br />forgetting people,
480397 483705 even those you have<br />a connection with.
483705 485664 You'll become displaced<br />in time and space...
495282 496892 Right now, you're mostly lucid
496892 500069 with small patches of confusion<br />and mental lapse.
500069 501810 So, then it'll reverse.
501810 503943 The moments of lucidity<br />will become the exception
503943 505901 and eventually,<br />go away altogether.
505901 507990 How much time do I have?
507990 509339 It's progressing<br />more aggressively
509339 510427 than I would like...
510427 511864 - Uhm...<br />- How much time?
513779 518784 You're looking at weeks,<br />not months.
518784 520525 If you have any arrangements<br />to make,
520525 524137 I suggest you do so<br />as quickly as possible.
524137 526618 Do you have family<br />that can take care of you?
529664 532232 None that would.<br />All right.
532232 536323 Then, I suggest you look<br />into care facilities.
538891 542068 This is a very good place...
542068 543591 in your area.
553514 555429 I'm sorry.
555429 558258 That's okay, doc.
558258 561000 Even if I hated you<br />for telling me,
561000 562741 I'd forget soon enough.
586286 588201 <i>What do you want to know?</i>
588549 590246 <i>I think you have secrets</i>
590246 591944 <i>you don't want to tell me</i>.
591944 594381 Secrets are secrets,<br />so I can't tell you.
597036 599038 I finished<br />the last book you lent me.
599038 601562 Oh, yeah?
601562 604521 What did you think?
604521 607133 I liked it but<br />the end was stupid.
607133 609788 Really?
609788 611354 He just lets them chop off<br />his head
611354 613661 while the other guy walks away?
613661 615532 Well, see...
615532 619667 His whole character arc leads<br />to that moment. You know?
620712 624803 It's a... sacrifice<br />for the greater good, you know?
624803 627849 Mmm...<br />like the end of "Casablanca"?
627849 629764 Yeah, like the end<br />of "Casablanca," exactly.
629764 632288 It was bullshit, too.
632288 634377 Rick would take the girl<br />10 times out of 10.
634377 638120 "A far, far better thing"<br />my ass.
638120 639774 Wow.
639774 642385 Is everyone from Kraków<br />that cynical?
642385 644779 I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.
647477 650045 What day is it?
650045 652569 - Thursday?<br />- No, no, I mean...
652569 654006 I mean what date.
654006 655572 The fifth, does that<br />mean something?
657705 660360 It's my son's birthday,
660360 664581 who hasn't spoken with me<br />many, many years.
668716 671763 Why does he hate you so much?
671763 677072 I'm what the Science journals<br />refer to as a "lousy father."
677072 678900 Mmm...
678900 680902 He found out<br />what I did for a living.
680902 682425 Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
682425 683992 What do you do<br />for a living?
683992 685690 I work for the IRS.
685690 687692 Just like that, I hate you too.
689650 691043 I've been coming here
691043 694220 once a week for almost...<br />four years
694220 697876 and that's the first thing<br />you've said about yourself.
697876 699355 What do you want to know?
699355 701357 I'll tell you anything,<br />just ask me.
701357 703838 Is that your real name,<br />Aristotle?
703838 706319 No, it's a nickname
706319 708147 the guys in my platoon gave me,
708147 709757 I was in the first Gulf War
709757 711150 and I used to read a lot<br />of books,
711150 713543 like philosophy<br />and... like that.
720899 722161 I got to go.
734042 737742 The thing with your son<br />explains a lot, though.
737742 739787 What do you mean?
739787 741006 You know how they say
741006 742921 haunted houses have cold spots?
744531 746228 Stand in certain areas,
746228 749014 and a chill goes down your spine<br />like an artic breeze.
749014 751059 What the hell<br />you're talking about?
751059 752452 That's what's like here.
752452 754323 You walk in the door<br />and you feel it.
754323 756499 Only it isn't a ghost.
756499 757936 What is it?
757936 759807 Loneliness.
761853 764420 See you next Thursday,<br />not really Aristotle.
769295 770339 This guy's<br />a piece of work.
770339 771601 I don't care.
771601 773473 Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>
773473 774996 Why do we always<br />have to go through this?
774996 776781 Why do we have to<br />go through what?
776781 779174 You ask me if I want to know<br />the details of the job
779174 780785 and I say, "no, I really don't"
780785 782699 and then you tell me<br />the details of the job
782699 784136 and then I say, "shut up" and<br />we go through it again and again
784136 785572 and we always go through
785572 786616 the same thing<br />every fucking time!
786616 787835 The question is,
787835 789271 why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
789271 790490 Ready.
794929 798541 Hey, this could be<br />my last job for a while.
798541 800935 What the fuck is going on, John?
800935 802894 Nothing, I just need to<br />take care of a few things
802894 804417 I'll clear it with Jericho.
804417 806201 Okay, how long are you<br />going to be out?
807594 808638 Hard to say.
809639 811859 Come on. Let's go.
811859 813034 This motherfucker sells<br />men for human labor,
813034 814209 that's a thing now.
814209 815776 Jesus Christ.
815776 816951 I thought trafficking<br />was like sex shit.
816951 818474 Same thing every time.
818474 819736 Didn't we just go<br />through this at the car?
822174 825177 Why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
825177 826569 Because in ten minutes,
826569 829921 Tommy, he's not going to<br />be anybody.
829921 831226 Let's go get this done.
930021 931500 Damn it.
995869 997001 Hello?
998785 999829 Yeah.
1001005 1003181 Well, we were...
1003181 1005531 expecting only one person<br />to be there.
1006532 1007663 We got split up.
1009187 1010753 I guess he figured...
1010753 1012625 I don't know,<br />we could cover more ground.
1014192 1017021 And I heard shots...
1021460 1022504 Christ, Tommy.
1026247 1027596 I didn't mean to.
1031252 1034038 - Knox...<br />- I'm sorry, Tommy.
1043743 1044787 Yeah, he was.
1047094 1050837 <i>Yeah. I made sure the scene<br />was clean and then I left.</i>
1057191 1058236 Okay.
1059367 1060412 Thank you.
1077994 1079953 You're buying this?
1079953 1082042 Five bullets, three victims?
1082042 1084740 Had to happen fast.
1084740 1086873 Are you thinking<br />there's a third shooter?
1086873 1088396 There's no evidence of that.
1091443 1093662 Growing up, I hated my mother.
1093662 1095751 Is that right?
1095751 1097797 She was a stereotype,<br />overbearing,
1097797 1100060 Asian, hellicopter mom.
1100060 1102149 An "A" minus meant<br />I didn't have any pride.
1102149 1103890 My mother was a drunk, so...
1103890 1105544 - This is about me.<br />- Sorry.
1105544 1108460 She hates my chosen profession<br />but, ironically,
1108460 1111854 made me a good detective.
1111854 1113247 Realizing her wanting me
1113247 1114857 to excel was about her<br />and not me,
1116250 1118383 gave me my first lesson<br />in motive.
1118383 1120994 She taught me that the details<br />were important.
1120994 1122387 The answers lie
1122387 1123823 in the little things<br />other people,
1123823 1125868 she meant white people, overlook.
1125868 1128393 With all due respect,<br />is this going somewhere?
1128393 1130264 There's water<br />all over the floor.
1130264 1133137 That means the shower was on<br />when the curtain came down.
1133137 1135226 Okay.
1135226 1137663 - So?<br />- So,
1137663 1139360 he killed them, they killed him,
1139360 1141188 all in a hurry,<br />bang, bang, bang.
1143059 1144235 Who turned off the shower?
1185798 1188235 - Hey, Knox.<br />- Hey.
1188235 1189932 Sit down. Want a drink?
1189932 1193240 Yeah. Yeah, whisky.
1193240 1196025 So...
1196025 1199246 you just swing by to say hello?
1199246 1201205 No, closing out.
1201205 1203642 I have to do it<br />pretty quick, too.
1203642 1205339 - Quick?<br />- Yeah.
1205339 1207211 - Jericho knows?<br />- He can't.
1208212 1210388 That makes it tough.
1210388 1211737 Raise your commission, I guess.
1213869 1218091 I'm uh... I'm going away.
1218091 1220180 For good this time.
1220180 1222791 And I don't want this<br />blowing back on Jericho.
1222791 1224053 What happened?
1224053 1225794 A job went South.
1225794 1229537 I set the scene out to buy<br />myself some time but...
1229537 1232540 - It's not going to last long.<br />- I'm sure about that.
1232540 1234586 Three people,
1234586 1236240 all shot each other<br />with the same gun.
1237502 1238807 Yeah, that's not good.
1240331 1242289 My gun.
1242289 1243638 - That's worse.<br />- Yeah.
1244726 1247642 So time is of the essence.<br />How do you have your capital.
1247642 1249340 Mostly cash.
1249340 1252081 Got some paintings<br />you got to sell. Some stones.
1252081 1254693 - That's simple enough.<br />- Yeah.
1258871 1260307 A list of three people.
1260307 1262440 All three, equal shares.
1262440 1265051 Nothing in here<br />for Muncie's family?
1265051 1266531 Muncie didn't have anybody.
1268620 1271927 I can't have any of this<br />touch those people.
1271927 1273581 This money has to be clean.
1276541 1280066 Gather your assets,<br />I'll set it up.
1280066 1281415 A couple of days.
1281415 1283112 Hey, this stays<br />between you and me.
1283112 1287073 Yeah, and I'm going to tell who?
1287073 1288988 All right.
1288988 1290250 All right, thanks.
1318365 1319801 What's up?
1319801 1321542 This key doesn't work<br />on the... uh...
1323239 1325503 - The thing, the...<br />- Lock?
1325503 1327809 - Lock, yeah.<br />- All right.
1327809 1329463 Yeah, the green ones,
1329463 1330595 they go to our other facility,<br />out in Van Nuys.
1330595 1331683 Okay.
1333598 1335208 Hey, could you do me a favor?
1335208 1338037 Could you... uh... write down<br />the number...
1338037 1339604 - The address?<br />- The address.
1339604 1340866 Yeah, got you.
1390742 1392439 Sorry, I didn't mean to...
1392439 1395181 just to show up like this,<br />I should've called.
1395181 1398706 I didn't mean to ambush you,<br />I'm sorry.
1398706 1400142 Do I know you?
1403145 1406235 Okay, I guess I deserve that.
1406235 1410283 You got to know I wouldn't<br />be here unless I was desperate.
1410283 1412590 Okay? I need your help.
1415331 1418291 Dad, could you please<br />just talk to me?
1418291 1419379 Dad.
1420685 1422426 Miles... yeah.
1424253 1427822 Sure, Miles.<br />Come here. Come on in.
1427822 1432087 Thank you, I just...
1432087 1435221 Have a seat.
1444186 1448452 No, no, no, I'm... I'm sober.<br />Nine years.
1455589 1457939 That's your blood?
1457939 1461943 Yeah, my hand is... Uhm...
1461943 1465164 I cut it in a...
1465164 1467862 This is my blood<br />and that's someone else's.
1467862 1469603 Holy fuck!
1475479 1476654 I fucked up.
1478743 1481267 I fucked up really bad.
1481267 1483661 Okay... okay.
1483661 1487055 Okay, take it easy.
1487055 1488927 Catch your breath.
1488927 1490929 Tell me what happened.
1494498 1496108 I killed someone.
1498066 1499503 Did they deserve killing?
1503594 1505770 Okay, start there.
1507511 1509861 Okay.
1509861 1513125 You have<br />a granddaughter.
1513125 1516781 - Kaylee.<br />- How did you know about her?
1516781 1519218 Your mother told me,<br />right after she was born.
1521176 1523701 Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.
1523701 1526921 What is she, like 12? 13?
1526921 1528923 She's 16.
1528923 1530534 Here...
1535713 1538237 - Cute kid.<br />- Yeah.
1538237 1539325 She's a kid.
1542371 1543851 And she met this guy...
1545505 1547246 Online. This...
1547246 1549857 piece of shit!
1549857 1551859 The guy was 32 years old.
1551859 1556385 This son of a bitch<br />gets her pregnant.
1556385 1559084 She's 16 years old,<br />she's my little girl.
1559084 1563131 So, I go over<br />to his house, you know?
1563131 1566221 I was just going to put<br />the fear of God on him.
1566221 1570051 And I show up and he's...
1570051 1572445 more than I expected. Okay?
1575535 1578364 He wouldn't shut up.<br />Just kept talking,
1578364 1581062 and talking and talking<br />about my fucking daughter.
1581062 1583238 Like, saying shit<br />about her, like...
1583238 1585153 "she loves it,"<br />"She wanted more."
1585153 1589375 Called her "ripe."<br />Called her ripe, dad!
1589375 1593335 Fuck! I just lost it.
1593335 1596425 So I grabbed a knife<br />and I sho...
1596425 1598514 I shoved it into his neck.
1601648 1604172 And I stabbed him.
1604172 1607132 I just... couldn't stop.
1609351 1610570 I didn't care.
1612137 1614139 Because I wasn't even<br />in the room, I was...
1622713 1623844 Did you bury this guy?
1624976 1626325 Did I bury him?
1626325 1628153 Yeah.
1628153 1630546 No, why?
1630546 1632244 Because if you did, I was<br />going to dig him up
1632244 1633419 and kill him again.
1639730 1641253 Oh, my God...
1642863 1644082 So, why did you come to me?
1648129 1650349 Are you kidding?
1651872 1654396 Well, I mean...
1654396 1656616 You're the only person<br />I know that can... I...
1656616 1658662 This isn't my world.
1658662 1663014 - I don't know how to...<br />- Get rid of a body.
1663014 1666887 I never asked you<br />for anything in my life.
1666887 1671849 Okay? And I'm here because<br />I had nowhere else to go.
1671849 1673938 Now you need me.
1673938 1676375 Yeah, that's what<br />this is, I'm desperate.
1676375 1679683 Okay? I'm so fucking desperate<br />that I'm here, at your house,
1679683 1681206 asking you for help.
1681206 1682511 Now, are you<br />going to help me or not?
1693261 1694741 Where's the murder weapon?
1720854 1722464 Here.
1722464 1724336 Put your clothes<br />in that plastic bag,
1724336 1726730 then take a shower<br />and scrub down everything.
1726730 1728949 Underneath the fingernails,<br />clean everything.
1728949 1730777 Then, afterwards,<br />I'm going to wrap and clean
1730777 1732344 that hand of yours.
1732344 1734607 - Then what?<br />- Then?
1734607 1736043 You go home to your wife
1736043 1739699 and you never<br />mention this again.
1739699 1741875 My whole life, I never<br />asked you for anything.
1741875 1745183 Yeah, you said that already.
1745183 1749753 Here, use that. I'm going to<br />need those boxers, too.
1754105 1756890 Hey, where's the body?
1829136 1831573 Write it down. Write it down.
2056276 2057582 There you are.
2060367 2061629 What are you doing?
2063109 2064110 Nothing.
2067766 2069550 I talked to her.
2071117 2072336 What did she say?
2074816 2077036 She wants you to take her.
2077036 2078081 What?
2079473 2081519 Well, I assumed this would be...
2081519 2084130 you know, like,<br />a mother-daughter thing.
2084130 2086654 Well, apparently it isn't.
2088265 2089918 What happened to your hand?
2099406 2100755 I have to tell you something.
2110548 2111940 All right, what do we got?
2111940 2114421 Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.
2114421 2116075 We're waiting<br />for the Interpol jacket
2116075 2118904 but safe to say he wasn't<br />a model citizen.
2118904 2121341 The woman was local,<br />Annette Elmora.
2121341 2122821 Yeah, we're thinking<br />maybe he picked her up
2122821 2124388 at a club or something.
2124388 2126738 You know, wrong place-wrong time<br />kind of thing.
2126738 2128914 Victim number three is<br />where it gets interesting.
2128914 2130307 Meet Thomas Muncie,
2130307 2132004 suspected hitter for Jericho.
2132004 2134354 Conspicuously missing<br />from the carnage,
2134354 2136835 this man, John Knox.
2136835 2138837 Traffic cam shot this<br />six blocks away
2138837 2140230 around the time of death.
2140230 2142406 Facial recognition flagged him.
2142406 2143624 That could just be<br />a driver, though.
2143624 2144973 We're sure this guy's a driver?
2144973 2147150 What's his jacket say?
2147150 2149500 Not much. He did a six-year<br />stretch for tax evasion
2149500 2151719 and that's only because<br />someone ratted them out.
2151719 2153678 Other than that<br />and his service record,
2153678 2155419 there's nothing on him.
2155419 2156985 Which means, whatever<br />this guy does for a living,
2156985 2158117 he's pretty good at it.
2158117 2159510 Smart, too.
2159510 2161338 According to the tax<br />auditor's notes,
2161338 2163383 John Knox holds two PhDs.
2163383 2166517 One in English Lit<br />and one in US History.
2166517 2168780 Even taught in Bucknell<br />a couple of years.
2168780 2171478 And we're thinking this guy<br />kills people for a living?
2171478 2173132 Why?
2173132 2175482 Hopefully, we'll get<br />to ask him ourselves.
2175482 2177223 What branch of service<br />was he in?
2177223 2180531 Army. He was a deep<br />reconnaissance officer.
2180531 2182968 Remind me what that is again?
2182968 2184448 Someone who goes off alone
2184448 2186406 behind enemy lines<br />for weeks at a time.
2186406 2188016 Then, maybe we just<br />bring him in
2188016 2189453 as a cooperating witness.
2189453 2191716 Friend-of-the-victim<br />kind of thing.
2191716 2193935 He might slip up<br />and give us something.
2193935 2195850 Does he seem like someone<br />who makes mistakes?
2195850 2199202 Hey, boss, check your texts.
2202640 2204207 Another body.
2204207 2205904 And now, we got three<br />on my board already.
2205904 2207993 Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.
2207993 2210343 That's your métier.
2210343 2212258 Métier? Really?
2220658 2222399 - John Knox.<br />- Hey!
2222399 2224270 - Hi.<br />- Is he upstairs?
2224270 2226011 Yeah. I'm supposed to think<br />he's doing the books.
2226011 2228405 - What's he really doing?<br />- Watching TV.
2228405 2230624 - I married a little boy.<br />- Yeah.
2230624 2232539 Well, he married up,<br />that's for sure.
2237762 2240330 Xavier! Coming up.
2252646 2255214 Look at this skinny<br />son of a bitch.
2255214 2259349 They rescued him<br />from a big cat sanctuary.
2259349 2262265 Locals toss him stray dogs<br />in a cave
2262265 2264310 so he can have something to eat.
2264310 2266443 Kind of reminds me of you.
2266443 2268706 You know, when I first found you<br />after your war.
2270664 2271926 I never ate a dog.
2273928 2276757 What's this,<br />grocery list?
2276757 2279282 It's a plan,<br />and I'm going to need your help.
2279282 2280413 Just read it.
2284330 2285897 Hey, Ludmilla looks good.
2287333 2290728 She still hasn't realized
2290728 2293208 what a mistake she made<br />marrying me.
2293208 2295428 You're learning any Russian?
2295428 2298866 Just the stuff she says<br />I need to know.
2298866 2301434 "Yes, dear." "Please."
2301434 2302740 All the essentials.
2306396 2308354 Okay, lay it on me.
2310138 2311923 Stabbed at least 17 times.
2313968 2315405 I put time of death between
2315405 2316841 3:00 and 8:00 p.m.<br />yesterday afternoon.
2316841 2318146 I'll get a more precise<br />time frame
2318146 2319365 when I get him to the shop.
2319365 2321541 - All right.<br />- Yeah.
2321541 2323761 Thanks, bro.
2323761 2325980 There's no murder weapon yet,
2325980 2328505 but there's a knife missing<br />from that kitchen block.
2328505 2331072 I mean, it doesn't even look<br />like anything was stolen.
2331072 2332639 He's got an expensive watch<br />on his wrist,
2332639 2335120 he's got a wallet<br />full of large bills...
2335120 2336730 I know this racist<br />piece of crap.
2336730 2339080 His name is Andrew Palmer.
2339080 2340691 He moves cash around
2340691 2342475 for the Aryan Brotherhood<br />but... he's a cog.
2342475 2345130 - Not a shot caller.<br />- So, he winds up dead.
2345130 2347393 There's no big mystery there.
2347393 2349308 But he also did a stretch<br />a few years back
2349308 2350918 for kiddie porn.
2350918 2353704 And this... this doesn't look<br />like business.
2353704 2355967 This looks personal.
2355967 2357316 Detective, gate guard out<br />front says
2357316 2358535 he was knocked out<br />last night.
2359840 2360885 I got this.
2363017 2366107 Bag the victim's computers,<br />any flash drives and discs.
2366107 2368414 - What are we looking for?<br />- You'll know when you see it.
2368414 2370198 Oh, and see if you can find<br />his phone,
2370198 2371374 he didn't have it on him.
2371374 2372418 Got it.
2379077 2381079 So, how long have you known?
2381079 2382907 Uh... not long.
2384387 2386780 Doc says this thing<br />moves pretty fast.
2386780 2389174 Oh, Jesus, Knox.
2389174 2392177 I can't think of anything worse.
2392177 2394135 Except maybe your pecker<br />stops working.
2394135 2400359 Actually, I'm looking forward<br />to forgetting some things.
2400359 2405451 Muncie... Christ.<br />I can't imagine what the--
2405451 2407322 That's like me shooting you.
2407322 2409716 I don't even remember<br />doing it. I mean, I know...
2409716 2413111 I know I did it but I have<br />no recollection of the event.
2413111 2415026 Well, count your blessings.
2416419 2417768 This is a radical plan.
2417768 2420814 It's the only way<br />I can figure it.
2420814 2424731 This kid's DNA is<br />all over the place.
2424731 2426254 He actually bled on the guy,
2426254 2428300 he's got his fingerprints<br />everywhere.
2428300 2431085 He might as well just<br />signed off on the job.
2431085 2433087 Still, if you don't<br />pull this off,
2433087 2437352 you're both fucked.<br />Yeah.
2437352 2439833 - I'm fucked either way.<br />- That's true.
2439833 2442445 That's why I'm asking you<br />to help me.
2442445 2444534 Look, just check in with me.
2444534 2447928 Just check in with me<br />now and then. You know?
2447928 2450931 - Make sure I'm on point.<br />- Yeah, of course, sure.
2450931 2456241 Just so you don't ever thing<br />this stupid plan is my idea.
2456241 2457895 I'm sure you'll remind me.
2460288 2461986 You want to know<br />the funny thing?
2461986 2464510 Let's say I pull this thing off,
2464510 2466860 I won't even know<br />if I did it or not.
2466860 2469210 It's encouraging.
2469210 2471952 This plan is<br />precision work, man.
2471952 2473824 - One hair out of place--<br />- Oh, I know.
2475521 2477567 I know.
2477567 2479873 I know I could pull this off.
2479873 2481179 The question is, can you?
2482615 2485531 So, you didn't see his face,<br />didn't see his height, nothing?
2485531 2486619 - No.<br />- Okay.
2486619 2487925 All right, thank you.
2491145 2492364 Beautiful day.
2492364 2494061 Sure.
2494061 2495498 What did you get?
2495498 2496586 Don't suppose he can<br />ID our killer.
2496586 2498152 No, he was attacked from behind.
2498152 2499719 He didn't see anything.
2499719 2501808 Happened a little before<br />three in the morning.
2501808 2503201 Doesn't fit the timeline.
2503201 2505638 M.E. said he was killed<br />before 8:00 p.m.
2505638 2507988 So you think the attack<br />on the guard is unrelated?
2507988 2510600 It's related, I'm just...<br />not sure how, yet.
2510600 2512906 They get anything off<br />these security cameras?
2512906 2514517 Well, that part is weird.
2514517 2516693 They feed into a DVR<br />in the utility closet.
2516693 2519304 - There's no hard drive.<br />- You mean it doesn't work?
2519304 2521611 No, I mean the tech<br />couldn't get playback
2521611 2522786 so we opened up the DVR<br />and looked inside,
2522786 2524178 no hard drive.
2524178 2525440 Found his phone.
2525440 2527225 Can't open it, though.
2527225 2528792 It's got one of those facial<br />recognition locks on it.
2528792 2532186 - Okay, head back inside.<br />- Okay.
2532186 2533710 What am I looking for?
2533710 2535842 His face. I assume<br />that's where it is...
2537061 2538105 Right.
2596511 2597643 Did you forget I was coming?
2598862 2600559 Oh... no, no.
2609176 2610221 How are you?
2613572 2616270 Good. I'm...
2616270 2618185 kind of knotted up.
2618185 2619447 That's why I'm here.
2622755 2625192 I finished the book.
2625192 2628674 It was... better but I knew<br />he was going to die in the end.
2628674 2630545 He kind of had to.
2630545 2632635 I'll find you another one here.
2636203 2637335 This is your ex?
2639816 2641861 Yeah.
2641861 2645473 - Well, she's gorgeous.<br />- Yeah.
2645473 2648433 Hey...
2648433 2653220 put that down--
2653220 2654657 Why don't I get ready?
2660445 2661576 Fuck me.
2681509 2685252 - These paintings are all real?<br />- Yeah.
2685252 2688995 - It's safer than cash.<br />- Are they worth a lot?
2688995 2692869 - Why do you have them?<br />- Part of my cashing-out process.
2692869 2694131 What?
2697264 2701138 - What do you mean "cashing out"?<br />- Forget I said it. Forget it.
2702617 2704358 Did you find me something?
2708188 2711409 Hello? You picked me<br />another book?
2713063 2714629 You want a book?
2714629 2718938 Knox, are you having<br />a stroke or something?
2718938 2721767 - Maybe you should sit down?<br />- You know what? Maybe...
2723900 2725292 Maybe it's better<br />if you just go.
2727860 2729340 Good idea.
2759674 2761720 Sorry.
2761720 2765550 I just got a...<br />Got a thing I got to do.
2765550 2768727 - Same time next week?<br />- Yeah.
2770207 2771817 Yeah, you bet, next week.
2771817 2773732 Are you sure you're<br />going to be okay?
2773732 2774820 Never better.
2811770 2813337 Here.
2814817 2816296 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
2816296 2819473 We have an appointment.<br />Last name's Knox.
2819473 2821736 Okay. All right, here it is.
2821736 2823869 You must be Kaylee. And you are?
2823869 2826741 I'm the father...<br />Her father, not the...
2826741 2828961 - I'm her dad.<br />- Okay, dad.
2828961 2832225 See, sign here.<br />Initial here, here and here.
2832225 2833792 Before we do the procedure,
2833792 2835838 the law says we have to<br />ask you a few questions.
2835838 2837187 Not about the father<br />of the child
2837187 2838928 or anything like that,
2838928 2841017 just to make sure<br />that <i>you</i> want to be here.
2841017 2842845 That'd be okay?
2842845 2844629 I guess so.
2844629 2845717 Good.
2846805 2849286 Now it's your turn.
2849286 2850896 I need a couple of signatures<br />from you,
2850896 2853116 starting here on the consent<br />form.
2860079 2861341 All right,<br />guys, have a sit.
2861341 2862473 Thank you.
2870002 2871438 <i>Are you having</i>
2871438 2873223 <i>a stroke of something?</i>
2885583 2886932 Xavier, hey.
2886932 2889369 I'm calling to make sure<br />you're on track.
2889369 2893939 - On track with what?<br />- Your cockamamie plan is what.
2893939 2896333 You got your notepad?
2896333 2897856 Yeah.
2899597 2901642 Yeah, I'm on track,<br />don't worry about it.
2901642 2902905 He says "don't worry."
2903993 2907213 Do me a favor,<br />unlock your phone.
2907213 2909737 <i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>
2909737 2912958 - <i>Okay?</i><br />- Why?
2912958 2917310 Well, what if you need help<br />and you can't remember the code.
2917310 2920400 Right... right, okay.
2920400 2922011 Yeah, got it.
2926711 2930933 - You're there?<br />- Huh? Yeah.
2930933 2933196 I feel like I'm getting worse<br />every hour.
2936895 2938375 I'm running out of time.
2938375 2942640 So, stop wasting it<br />talking to me. Okay?
3018759 3021066 What?<br />I'm in the middle of dinner.
3022285 3024243 It's not even 4:30.
3024243 3025723 Oh, I'm almost 90.
3025723 3027507 Dinner time is<br />very important to me.
3027507 3029335 What's up?
3029335 3031772 <i>Yeah, I'm looking at<br />some kind of locker key.</i>
3031772 3034036 <i>Do you know where that's from?</i>
3034036 3035559 <i>You never confided</i>
3035559 3036647 <i>in me where you keep<br />all your money.</i>
3036647 3039606 I'm a crook, you know?
3039606 3041913 All right. Great, thanks,<br />I'll figure it out.
3041913 3043480 Hey, wait a minute.
3043480 3045221 Did you take the passcode<br />off your phone?
3045221 3047832 Ehm... yeah, I'm going to<br />do that now.
3047832 3049790 I'll do it right now. Okay?
3049790 3052793 Thanks. Say hi to Becky from me.
3052793 3056275 - Wait, who?<br />- <i>Becky.</i>
3056275 3058756 Ehm... okay.
3058756 3061193 - All right.<br />- How's he doing?
3061193 3064544 - He just called you Becky.<br />- Who's this Becky?
3064544 3066285 She was one of my wives.
3066285 3069462 I divorced her before<br />you were born, baby.
3069462 3072813 This business with Knox...<br />It's not good.
3072813 3075033 No.
3075033 3076208 It's not.
3127607 3128652 Shit.
3188015 3190714 I ordered some food,<br />this place has great ribs.
3190714 3195066 I'm a vegan. Should we...?
3195066 3196894 Should we be meeting<br />in public like this?
3196894 3198200 No one knows us here.
3200463 3203727 - How's the hand?<br />- Well, it...
3203727 3206469 - hurts.<br />- If anyone asks you about it,
3206469 3208079 you cut on broken glass.
3208079 3209950 You were at my house,<br />we were having a drink.
3209950 3212910 What? Why would I be<br />at your place?
3212910 3214085 You were looking for<br />your old Hot Wheels,
3214085 3215521 make something up.
3219786 3221310 - How are you doing?<br />- How am I doing?
3221310 3222963 Yeah, uhm...
3224313 3226967 Spent the day<br />at the abortion clinic with...
3226967 3230667 my 16-year-old daughter<br />so, bad, I guess.
3230667 3232669 Pretty bad.
3232669 3236063 Not sleeping, not eating.<br />I haven't eaten since yesterday.
3236063 3237500 Uhm...
3237500 3239371 My hair is falling out.
3239371 3242026 So, I'm about to lose<br />my goddamn mind.
3242026 3245029 Okay, okay.<br />You need to get a grip.
3245029 3246857 I don't know how<br />to do this, I'm not...
3246857 3248380 I'm not like you, you know?
3250077 3251383 I'm not a killer.
3256388 3258477 You are, though.
3258477 3260784 What?
3260784 3263700 A killer.
3263700 3266964 Damn good one, too.<br />Not half-assed.
3266964 3270359 I was out at the scene.<br />Let me put it to you this way:
3272448 3276756 that wasn't what you call<br />a proportional response.
3276756 3279368 - I lost it.<br />- Understandable.
3279368 3282675 But now I need you<br />to pull it all together, okay?
3282675 3284329 You're like<br />a walking confession.
3284329 3285504 I'll try harder.
3285504 3288115 No, do the opposite. Relax.
3289900 3290944 Okay.
3300606 3301694 Is she your only kid?
3304915 3310964 We... we lost one early on,<br />a miscarriage.
3311661 3313967 - Sorry, it's tough.<br />- Yeah.
3316230 3318450 More on Cheryl, actually.
3318450 3321061 What does she do, Cheryl?
3321061 3323368 Teaches fourth grade,
3323368 3325327 public school.
3325327 3329243 Yeah and... kids love her.
3329243 3331898 All right.<br />Boy, you guys are busy.
3331898 3334597 Working parents,<br />on the go all the time.
3334597 3337687 What's the typical day?
3337687 3341168 Tomorrow for instance,<br />what would you do tomorrow?
3341168 3343780 Go get breakfast somewhere
3343780 3345564 and walk around<br />Largemouth Village
3345564 3348088 and then Kaylee has<br />soccer and...
3348088 3351091 - You now.<br />- Do that. Do that.
3351091 3353093 - Just do that.<br />- Do that?
3353093 3356662 Yeah.<br />- We can't, she's laid up in bed.
3356662 3359752 Don't vary your routine,<br />do what you would normally do.
3379990 3381644 What happened to vegan?
3381644 3383559 Fuck it, I'm starving.
3383559 3386431 I've been starving<br />for six years.
3386431 3390783 You ever take the family<br />up to the cabin?
3390783 3393960 - The hunting cabin?<br />- Yeah.
3393960 3395440 I sold it, remember?
3395440 3397486 You signed the papers<br />two years ago.
3399923 3401272 These are so fucking good.
3402099 3404406 Yeah.
3404406 3405885 I remember that.<br />You know anything about the...
3406930 3408801 about if the owners...<br />I mean, if they use it...
3408801 3410455 full time or...
3410455 3411500 part time?
3411500 3413023 - The buyers?<br />- Yeah.
3415155 3417114 Well, I'm not renting it<br />to them. They...
3417114 3418637 I sold it to them.
3418637 3420639 They bought it, they own it.<br />I have no...
3420639 3422424 - Right.<br />- Why would I know what they do?
3422424 3423947 Okay, listen to me.
3426210 3427385 You just need to...
3428560 3429909 hold it together, okay?
3429909 3432564 We're almost there,<br />couple of days.
3432564 3433652 Okay.
3435393 3436438 Look at me.
3440354 3442269 I need you to use my balls.
3443532 3445011 What?
3445011 3447666 They're gonna connect Kaylee<br />to the dead guy.
3447666 3449538 Then they're gonna question you.
3449538 3451931 If you don't think you have<br />the balls for it, use mine.
3451931 3454934 Do whatever you think I would do<br />if I was on that chair.
3456196 3457633 All right?
3457633 3458721 What?
3466163 3467686 I never hated you, you know?
3469645 3470733 Well...
3473257 3475128 Be understandable if you did.
3475128 3476652 You were a good dad in your way.
3478349 3479698 I remember a lot of good.
3481874 3484790 I remember ball games.<br />I remember you teaching me...
3484790 3485878 how to hunt.
3487706 3490056 I remember you letting me<br />eat pancakes in the pool.
3493625 3496454 I worshiped you.
3496454 3497934 I wanted to be just like you.
3501154 3502808 Then, you know, I found out.
3505463 3506508 And I thought...
3510816 3511991 What if I did?
3517301 3519433 Did what?
3519433 3521044 What if I wound up<br />just like you?
3526702 3527746 And here we are.
3532621 3533709 Yeah, here we are.
3575054 3577927 All right... Gelfuso, you're up.
3577927 3581408 Okay. Scene was<br />definitely staged.
3581408 3583062 Ballistics says<br />all three victims
3583062 3584716 killed with the same gun.
3584716 3586979 Uh, didn't see that coming.<br />That's a fun one.
3586979 3588546 They find the gun?<br />Yeah.
3588546 3590940 It was the one<br />in shower guy's hand.
3590940 3592724 Five shots total.
3592724 3595509 Only prints on the gun belong<br />to the dead Spaniard.
3596162 3598469 Anybody holding out<br />for a triple murder-suicide?
3598469 3600036 That would be a neat trick.
3600036 3601690 Specially the part<br />where he reaches out
3601690 3603692 and turns off the shower<br />after he's already dead.
3603692 3604910 Nice catch.<br />Thank you.
3607304 3608914 What else?
3608914 3610133 I scoured<br />every surveillance camera
3610133 3611743 in the area.
3611743 3613266 I can't put anyone<br />in the house with Muncie.
3613266 3615225 Least of all is<br />John Knox's character.
3615225 3616792 We know Knox's movements?
3616792 3618141 He hasn't used
3618141 3619621 his credit card<br />since the murder.
3619621 3621318 Two days before them,
3621318 3623973 he flies from Burbank to<br />San Francisco for 22 hours.
3623973 3625670 Why?
3625670 3627629 That part,<br />I haven't figured out yet.
3627629 3629282 But I got him on the return<br />flight then he goes dark.
3629282 3632285 I think it's time we had a chat<br />with John Knox.
3632285 3634679 Go pick him up,<br />but bring him in voluntarily.
3634679 3636463 We got nothing<br />to hold him as a suspect.
3636463 3637639 All right.
3798234 3800671 Do you know what electives<br />you're gonna take this year?
3801715 3803892 Did you get your syllabus?
3803892 3806764 Yeah, I actually ended up<br />getting a class with Michelles.
3806764 3807852 Mhm!
3810942 3812335 I got<br />a pick-up order for Anthony.
3821953 3824434 I-I just think that it might be<br />too much this year.
3824434 3826523 Thanks.<br />- Very good.
3826523 3827959 I'm still gonna do soccer.<br />I think...
3827959 3829569 Hey, excuse me.<br />Yeah.
3829569 3830657 I saw you<br />looking at my daughter.
3830657 3831963 Do I know you?
3831963 3833443 No.<br />Hey! Oh, my God!
3833443 3834661 Fuck you!
3850112 3851678 John Knox?
3851678 3853767 Johnny Law.
3853767 3856901 We got something going on<br />we'd like to get your help with.
3856901 3859599 If you could come with us.<br />Voluntarily.
3859599 3860818 Sure.
3860818 3862428 Why not? It's my day off.
3862428 3864561 I'll grab a jacket<br />and I'll follow you down.
3864561 3866476 Or we could follow you down.
3867869 3869174 Better.
3874092 3877530 She's on my policy. I told you,<br />and I told the last person.
3878923 3880751 It was pre-approved.
3880751 3882535 Her doctor faxed it in.
3882535 3884929 You know, we go<br />through the same fuck...
3884929 3886975 damn thing every month.
3886975 3888672 D-don't put me on hold.
3894591 3896506 We got Knox set up<br />in Interview Two.
3899465 3901641 Anything on the other case?<br />Homer?
3901641 3904993 the prints we found don't<br />match anything on the system.
3904993 3906385 The ME confirmed<br />that there were
3906385 3908083 two blood types<br />on the scene,
3908083 3909432 but hadn't had time to run<br />DNA sequencing to look
3909432 3911303 for a match on the second guy.
3916482 3917788 It's always "guys" with you.
3919616 3922184 - Eh?<br />- You said "the second guy."
3922184 3923794 You also said the gate card
3923794 3926014 was grabbed from behind<br />by "the guy,"
3926014 3927711 even though he never saw<br />his attacker.
3927711 3929495 It's always "guys" with you.
3929495 3932629 Fine. The ME has not had time<br />to run DNA sequencing
3932629 3935458 to look for a match on the<br />second them, they or their.
3935458 3937721 - Is that better?<br />- Welcome to the 21st century.
3937721 3939157 Oh, my God.
3950429 3952344 Detective. How can I help you?
3953432 3955130 Save it for the tape.
3957001 3959003 Detective Emily Ikari,
3959003 3962224 interviewing potential<br />material witness, John Knox.
3962224 3965096 Case number 52698.
3966271 3970058 Interview is voluntary.<br />Commencing at 10:46 a.m.
3971189 3973191 Ah... please state your name<br />for the record.
3974018 3975367 John Knox.
3975367 3977239 Ah, full legal.<br />Need the middle name.
3985638 3986944 It's not a trick question.
3986944 3988641 Those come later.
3989555 3990817 John Henry Knox.
3994517 3996301 Okay. I don't know<br />what game this is,
3996301 3997476 but let's move on.
3999435 4002438 You said something about...
4002438 4004222 me being a witness?
4004222 4007530 I hope so. I'm working<br />on the death of your partner.
4007530 4010533 - I don't have a partner.<br />- Not anymore.
4010533 4012404 If you're referring<br />to Thomas Muncie,
4012404 4013666 he was an acquaintance.
4013666 4015451 We never did any work together.
4015451 4018889 I've been over the crime scene<br />a dozen times. Ah...
4018889 4020369 let me tell you<br />what I think happened.
4020369 4021457 Sure.
4022371 4024808 There were three dead bodies<br />in that room,
4024808 4026462 all shot with the same gun,
4026462 4028333 and staged to look<br />like they killed each other.
4029508 4032033 But... it was clumsy.
4032033 4035297 Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.
4035297 4039083 I think someone<br />killed Muncie by mistake
4039083 4040954 and tried to stage it<br />to cover it up.
4044523 4047352 Did you say Ikari?
4047352 4049920 Are you related to Peter Ikari?
4052444 4054446 That's my father.<br />Oh, hell.
4055534 4057101 I know Pete.
4057101 4058711 Get him in here.<br />I'll talk to him.
4058711 4060191 You know my father?
4061192 4064152 I just talked to him...<br />couple days ago.
4064152 4066023 He used to patrol<br />my neighborhood.
4067329 4068982 Mr. Knox, my father is dead.
4070941 4071985 What?
4074684 4076120 What happened?
4076120 4078035 He was shot in the line of duty.
4078035 4079123 Twelve years ago.
4081865 4083388 Where are you going<br />with all this?
4091614 4092702 Look.
4094791 4097010 As far<br />as the Muncie murder goes,
4097010 4098838 I wasn't there.
4098838 4101711 And if you had anything<br />to suggest that I was,
4101711 4104888 I'd be doing this interview<br />in a jumpsuit right now.
4104888 4107804 So, as far as you're concerned,
4107804 4109762 I'm Schrodinger's murderer.
4109762 4110850 Schro-what now?
4111895 4112939 At this moment...
4115768 4120164 I both did<br />and did not kill Muncie.
4120164 4122253 And with that,<br />I'm gonna get going.
4122253 4123733 What's your hurry?
4125126 4128259 I'm gonna be going away soon.
4128259 4131219 And before I do,<br />there are some things...
4131219 4132611 I better put right.
4132611 4135527 Interview suspended 10:52 a.m.
4138574 4140271 What in the fuck was that?
4140271 4141490 I don't know.
4141490 4143405 Strange fucking tactics.
4143405 4144754 So what's our next move?
4144754 4146712 Not sure.
4146712 4148018 How about we catch<br />our other killer
4148018 4149193 while I mull it over?
4165949 4166993 "Walker."
4168995 4170562 Walker. John Walker.
4173348 4174392 Damnit.
4258998 4260043 Miles?
4291901 4293119 John?
4296384 4297776 What's with the chrome?
4297776 4299212 What? Are you gonna shoot me?
4299996 4301737 The hell are you doing<br />in my kitchen?
4302781 4304653 Can't believe the key<br />is in the same spot.
4304653 4307438 - Let me get those groceries.<br />- No, no, no, no, no. No.
4307438 4309135 Don't touch the groceries.
4310441 4312095 What are you doing here?
4316360 4317361 I'm here.
4328285 4329330 Hey, I'm...
4332115 4333159 cashing out.
4334422 4335771 So there's gonna be...
4335771 4337729 gonna be some money<br />coming your way.
4337729 4341994 I don't want your money.
4341994 4343996 Let's... let's skip the part
4343996 4345694 where you pretend<br />you don't and...
4345694 4347652 I pretend to talk you into it.
4362450 4363755 Why are you cashing out?
4366105 4367150 Going away.
4369413 4370458 Of course you are.
4373983 4376115 I meant what I said<br />about the money.
4376115 4377943 I never wanted<br />anything from you...
4379336 4380424 except for you.
4382948 4385342 But I guess we both knew<br />that was too much to ask.
4395918 4396962 Yeah.
4401489 4403316 So, anyway. Uhm...
4405144 4408757 I need you to make sure<br />Miles takes his share.
4408757 4410759 That's...
4412500 4413501 That's harder.
4418201 4419898 Miles is harder.
4419898 4423206 Yeah. And have him...
4424860 4426383 So he can put...
4426383 4427776 ah... the girl...
4428820 4429865 She can go...
4430692 4431780 Go to the, uh...
4433869 4434913 You know.
4436915 4438003 Goddammit.
4439440 4440441 The big school.
4442007 4443748 College.<br />Yeah.
4443748 4445576 Yeah, uh...
4445576 4447796 Yeah.
4447796 4449406 I mean, you know,
4449406 4451626 something good has to come out<br />of all this.
4451626 4453497 How long you going away for?
4454455 4456108 There's no coming back<br />from this one.
4463115 4465509 They finally caught up<br />to you, uh?
4465509 4467337 You must be slipping.
4468860 4470427 Yeah.
4471863 4473038 Yeah, you could say that.
4487488 4488924 So, anyway...
4490752 4492231 yeah.
4492231 4493363 Okay.
4495365 4496409 All right.
4503547 4504635 Knox...
4506289 4510119 I still love you. Just a little.
4510119 4511555 As much as I hate you,
4511555 4512904 I wouldn't want to shoot you,<br />so...
4514558 4515820 call ahead next time.
4517692 4518736 Yeah.
4520172 4521609 There isn't gonna be<br />a next time.
4568481 4570571 <i>You must be<br />slipping.</i>
4579449 4581146 <i>But I guess<br />we both know</i>
4581146 4582408 <i>that was too much to ask.</i>
4589241 4591069 Knox.
4591069 4592201 Fucking...
4592201 4593376 John?
4593376 4595726 Sorry. Am I early?
4603255 4604605 No, uh...
4605997 4608826 I was just gonna... why don't I<br />jump in the shower?
4608826 4612351 Let's have a drink first.<br />I'll make you one for once.
4617356 4620533 I wasn't sure you'd want me here<br />after last time.
4620533 4622144 Why? What happened last time?
4626061 4628237 You got me worried, Knox.
4628237 4629412 Jesus, Ruby!
4629412 4631240 Don't worry about it.
4631240 4634417 I just gotta get a handle<br />on this last part of this thing.
4634417 4636985 How is the cash out coming?
4636985 4638726 I got the paintings<br />and I got the cash,
4638726 4640684 I just have<br />to get the stones here tonight.
4640684 4641990 The stones?
4641990 4644514 Yeah, the stones.
4644514 4645863 And then I gotta take them<br />to my guy.
4645863 4647517 He turns everything<br />into clean cash.
4648257 4650215 Then I just have to...
4650215 4651913 cut it into thirds.
4651913 4653044 Why thirds?
4654002 4656482 Only got three people<br />on the list. You're on the list.
4660269 4662227 I don't even<br />look like her, Knox.
4671497 4673499 Here's<br />to every Thursday afternoon.
4698481 4699656 You just get a hand job?
4701440 4703007 Better.
4703007 4705444 You're not gonna believe<br />what Tech just found.
4705444 4707446 - So tell me.<br />- No!
4707446 4710319 No. You gotta hear this<br />for yourself. Come on!
4710319 4712408 <i>Okay,</i>
4712408 4713844 everything we thought we'd find
4713844 4714889 based on his previous<br />arrest record.
4714889 4716760 Oh, God.
4716760 4718327 But where
4718327 4719415 it gets interesting<br />is in his live chats.
4719415 4720764 He was communicating
4720764 4721896 with half a dozen<br />young teen girls.
4721896 4723462 Convincing them to send nudes.
4723462 4725160 When we get the guy<br />who killed this asshole,
4725160 4726552 - we should give him a medal.<br />- First we let him loose
4726552 4727640 on a few other guys<br />I can think of.
4727640 4729033 It's always guys with you.
4729033 4730208 There's one girl
4730208 4731775 he talked to for over a year,
4731775 4733516 but then they actually started<br />to meet up IRL.
4733516 4735431 IRL?
4735431 4737085 In real life.
4737085 4739740 So say that.
4739740 4742220 They definitely<br />had sex.
4742220 4744179 A lot of sex.<br />They talked about it.
4744179 4745658 Extensively.
4745658 4746877 Anybody got a Tums?
4749837 4752622 Anyway, I was able to trace<br />her IP address.
4752622 4754276 She's a 16-year-old girl
4754276 4757061 in Silver Lake by the name<br />of Kaylee Iris Knox.
4757061 4758628 Okay.
4758628 4760412 Let's talk<br />to her and her parents.
4761544 4762850 Wait.
4762850 4764068 You said "Knox"?
4764068 4766636 I ran the family.
4766636 4768769 It's John Knox's granddaughter.
4877442 4880750 I'm sorry. Why do you want<br />to talk to our daughter?
4880750 4883796 Ah... we just have<br />a few questions for Kaylee.
4883796 4885233 And for your husband.
4885233 4886321 You guys are gonna be<br />right in here.
4888627 4890542 Oh, Mr. Knox.
4890542 4891717 Actually, we're gonna put you<br />in this room right over here.
4893241 4894329 Hang on a second.
4896592 4898899 Just be honest, okay?<br />Tell the truth.
4903729 4906471 Detective Ikari is gonna be<br />right with you.
4986073 4987770 <i>Like, what if I did?</i>
5009705 5011228 Detective Emily Ikari,
5011228 5013013 interviewing Miles Knox.<br />It is...
5014144 5015667 4:37 p.m.
5018148 5019280 Andrew Palmer.
5021499 5023066 What?
5023066 5025329 Pretty sure you know who he is.
5025329 5027505 I thought this was<br />about the fight at the café.
5027505 5029638 What fight at what café?
5033729 5034773 Okay...
5036297 5037776 What about that prick?
5037776 5039865 We know<br />what happened between you.
5039865 5041302 You called them?
5041302 5042694 You said you wouldn't call them.
5042694 5044392 - No, we didn't.<br />- No. You promised
5044392 5045871 if I went to the clinic,<br />you wouldn't tell on him.
5045871 5046959 Honey...
5046959 5048091 Kaylee, Kaylee.
5048091 5049614 Your parents didn't call us.
5049614 5051312 Neither your mom or your dad.
5051312 5053270 What's this about, then?<br />What do you want to know?
5053270 5056273 We found chats on his computer<br />between him and your daughter.
5056273 5059450 We're pretty sure<br />you know what's going on.
5059450 5061061 We know that he raped you.
5063106 5065195 H-he... he didn't rape me.
5068024 5069808 Did you arrest him?
5069808 5072768 No. He... he's not<br />in any trouble with the law.
5072768 5074291 Well, if you're asking me
5074291 5075423 if I want to press charges,<br />I don't wanna--
5075423 5076859 It's too late for that.
5076859 5077947 He's dead.
5082038 5083083 Good.
5084171 5086651 Was it an accident?<br />'Cause I hope he suffered.
5086651 5087957 I wanna show you something.
5092266 5093571 See that there?
5093571 5095573 That's your car.
5095573 5098663 Driving into the gated<br />neighborhood where Palmer lives.
5098663 5100361 This is about 20 minutes later.
5101710 5104016 See by the timestamp. See?
5104016 5105714 That's you, no doubt.
5105714 5107759 Yeah, that's me.
5107759 5109718 Yeah, I went to see him.<br />So what?
5109718 5112851 So, somewhere<br />in this time frame,
5112851 5114984 Palmer was stabbed to death<br />in his kitchen.
5114984 5116638 Wow. You can narrow the<br />time of death
5116638 5118118 to 20 minutes?
5118118 5119423 Modern science.
5119423 5120511 This is the part<br />where you tell me
5120511 5121643 you just went to warn him
5121643 5122992 to stay away from your daughter?
5122992 5124559 Yeah, it's exactly right.
5124559 5126169 And I might have punched him.
5126169 5127301 Mhm...
5127953 5129825 How did you cut your hand there?
5129825 5131392 On a glass.
5131392 5133002 We're gonna find<br />that glass in your house?
5133002 5134656 No, I was at...
5134656 5137006 What do you mean at my house?
5137006 5139095 Based on this video,
5139095 5141445 we obtained a warrant<br />for your house and your car.
5141445 5142707 They're being searched now.
5146015 5148060 I'm not gonna say another word<br />until my attorney gets here.
5148060 5150324 And that goes<br />for my underaged daughter.
5150324 5153065 Stop talking to her. Right now.
5164294 5165513 You all right?
5168516 5169647 Hey, man. Are you okay?
5175087 5176263 Yeah.
5176263 5178221 <i>We got you.</i>
5178221 5179353 Do you, now?
5179353 5180963 Don't say anything.
5180963 5182094 Sure.
5182094 5184227 I'll do the talking.
5184227 5185968 Show you what we found?
5190886 5192366 Your bloody clothes found
5192366 5194716 in a dumpster<br />behind your apartment.
5194716 5196544 What? Bullshit.
5196544 5198241 The murder weapon...
5198241 5201375 hidden in a heating vent<br />in your apartment.
5201375 5202941 No, no.<br />Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5202941 5205335 - That's not right.<br />- Miles, stop talking.
5205335 5208033 The knife has prints<br />all over it.
5208033 5209600 We'll be pulling yours<br />for comparison
5209600 5211254 in about five minutes.
5211254 5214257 Me? I'm confident.
5214257 5217869 Long, blonde hair recovered<br />from the lapel of your coat.
5217869 5220132 Would you wanna bet<br />it matches the victim?
5220132 5222265 Don't speak.
5222265 5226400 Miles Knox, I'm arresting you<br />for the murder of Andrew Palmer.
5226400 5228532 You have the right<br />to remain silent.
5228532 5230230 Anything you say<br />can be held against you
5230230 5231622 in a court of law.
5232406 5234669 Here, a little coin<br />for your trouble.
5234669 5236932 I'm good. I'm glad<br />you guys showed up.
5236932 5238020 Take care of him.
5238020 5239108 Thank you.
5241763 5244244 All kinds of people<br />make this world, don't they?
5248944 5250162 Okay, pal.
5251642 5253688 How are you even here?
5253688 5256691 I'm the last person<br />you called, see?
5256691 5259259 Give Ludmilla your keys.<br />She'll drive your Caddy back.
5259259 5261391 I can drive my own car.
5261391 5262958 It's right<br />around the corner.
5262958 5264133 50 meters away. Come.
5267267 5268790 Hey,<br />congrats on the arrest.
5268790 5270574 Thanks.
5270574 5271967 I found out why Knox went<br />to San Francisco.
5271967 5273969 He was there to see a doctor.
5273969 5276101 !Ah... Doctor...
5276101 5277494 Frederick Burns.
5278756 5280236 The neurologist?
5280236 5281324 How do you know that?
5282543 5283935 Obviously,
5283935 5285502 I couldn't get<br />any medical records,
5285502 5287287 but the guy specializes<br />in treating dementia.
5289114 5290812 Okay. Good work.
5290812 5291943 Thank you.
5294772 5297035 Did you at least<br />get what you came for?
5299473 5301518 Yeah... yeah.
5308699 5310701 Xavier...
5310701 5312137 I can only remember about...
5313225 5316098 Three hours of today.
5316098 5318143 It's like a curtain coming down.
5322104 5323410 That's rough.
5326151 5327196 Why me?
5328415 5330155 I mean, you know.
5330155 5333420 Trained killer, Army,<br />and all that, I know, but...
5333420 5334812 Why'd you pull me in?
5338076 5341819 That brain of yours.
5341819 5343343 I knew you'd understand
5343343 5344735 the training<br />I was putting you through.
5346563 5347912 You know, in all this time...
5347912 5349479 Mhm?
5349479 5351960 Never left a print behind,<br />no DNA, nothing.
5351960 5354179 Mmm...
5354179 5356617 I learned from the master.
5356617 5358140 What's your count, anyway?
5358140 5359707 Two.
5359707 5360838 Two?
5362492 5363711 Come on.
5363711 5365582 The cabbie in Chicago and...
5366801 5368280 a woman in the shower.
5371936 5374025 Two civilians. Fuck.
5375636 5376680 You know...
5377681 5380118 Muncie...
5380118 5383905 he liked to talk<br />about the targets, you know.
5383905 5385646 Pimps, drug dealers, traffickers.
5386864 5387909 Yeah.
5388997 5390390 I think it made him feel better.
5392043 5394219 He never got what it was...
5394219 5395525 really all about.
5396918 5398049 Which was?
5398049 5400922 Guys caught behind enemy lines.
5400922 5402053 That's all.
5406231 5408016 So...
5408016 5410932 We only have two steps left.
5412716 5415850 Your visit and my call.
5415850 5417199 Visit and a call.
5418896 5421290 Visit and the call,<br />visit and the call.
5421290 5422639 I can do that.
5422639 5424511 Keep the notes in your pocket.
5425860 5428776 I'll remind you when to go.
5430517 5431779 You'll be done
5431779 5432867 tomorrow.
5437654 5439395 I'm scared.
5439395 5440918 Yeah
5440918 5442006 I figured.
5458370 5459894 Hey...
5459894 5462679 I need you to do<br />one more thing for me.
5462679 5464420 Finish my cash out.
5464420 5466509 Take my stuff to Philo.
5466509 5469207 You wanna put me<br />in charge of your money?
5469207 5470731 You know I'm a thief.
5470731 5472341 You're not gonna steal from me.
5472341 5474082 No...
5474082 5475518 Probably not.
5475518 5477694 Wait here. I'll bring it out.
5477694 5479043 Okay, yeah.
5552726 5554945 I'm sorry, Knox.
5554945 5556033 It's a lot of money.
5559602 5560647 Can't argue with that.
5564825 5566957 - Now what?<br />- Get the stones.
5566957 5568045 Ah...
5570482 5572049 Easy, easy, easy.
5591155 5592635 Where you going, huh?
5592635 5594289 Eh?
5637680 5638681 Knox...
5642729 5644600 How were you gonna<br />split the take?
5645906 5647211 Four equal shares.
5650301 5651694 That's funny?
5651694 5652869 Yeah, it is.
5655611 5656917 You were gonna get a third.
5658309 5659354 What?
5660877 5662444 You were one of the three.
5663924 5665708 You're thinking of your ex-wife.
5665708 5667101 No, Annie.
5667101 5668189 It was you.
5670713 5674021 My Thursday afternoon date<br />for the last four years.
5675631 5678460 My ex-wife, my son...
5679461 5680505 and you.
5682594 5683726 All you had to do...
5685641 5686686 was nothing.
5700612 5702527 He wants to make<br />a change to the list.
5702527 5704791 Take off the last name,<br />the hooker.
5704791 5707097 No problemo.
5707097 5710274 You split it even, fifty-fifty,<br />between the wife and the son.
5710274 5712189 Carve out something for you?
5712189 5713930 No, I'm good.
5735778 5737519 What the hell, Dad?
5737519 5739347 I don't understand why you'd--
5739347 5741697 Wait, wait, wait. Stop.<br />I don't understand...
5741697 5743307 Stop. Just listen to me.
5743307 5745135 I'm so confused.
5745135 5746528 I went to you for help.
5746528 5749879 Why? Why would you<br />do this to me?
5749879 5752273 You're the reason<br />I went to prison.
5754231 5755363 I'm what?
5755363 5756668 The tax evasion thing.
5757321 5759933 You're the one<br />who ratted me out.
5759933 5761848 What the hell? I didn't know<br />anything about you back then.
5761848 5765286 I did six years because of you.
5765286 5768028 No, no. That's not true.
5768028 5769594 That's not true, Dad.
5769594 5771118 Listen to me.<br />I think you're losing it.
5771118 5772815 Something's wrong with you.<br />Why would...
5772815 5774164 Why would you<br />think I would do that?
5774164 5775252 Look at me.
5776950 5777994 It was you.
5780344 5781824 You turned me in.
5781824 5784174 I did not! I didn't do it, Dad!
5784174 5787264 That's not true!<br />Dad, listen to me! Listen to me!
5787264 5789397 Dad! Goddammit!
5789397 5790790 Listen to me!
5790790 5793270 Why would I do that<br />even if I knew!
5793270 5794358 You're wrong!
5803019 5804629 - Hey, Ikari.<br />- What?
5804629 5806327 There's a problem<br />with the Palmer evidence.
5806327 5809460 - Which evidence?<br />- All of it.
5809460 5812333 It's a first. There is a problem<br />with the blood on the clothes.
5812333 5814161 Evidence of Erythromycin.
5814161 5817207 That's a molecular breakdown<br />consistent with freezing.
5817207 5821559 The blood on the clothes was<br />frozen for at least 12 hours
5821559 5823692 before it was thawed<br />and put on the fabric.
5824606 5825999 Put?
5825999 5827565 Yeah. Same with the knife.
5827565 5829393 Wait... that's not<br />the murder weapon?
5829393 5831743 No, it definitely is,<br />and the blood is the victim's.
5831743 5833615 The issue is<br />with the fingerprints.
5833615 5835008 No. I saw the comparison.
5835008 5836226 They matched<br />Miles Knox's prints,
5836226 5837793 no question.
5837793 5839664 Yes, but they contained<br />traces of monomers.
5839664 5841884 Butyl acrylate<br />and methyl methacrylate.
5841884 5842885 Packing tape.
5843625 5845932 Also, some sort<br />of household spice.
5845932 5847411 I'm sorry, detective.
5847411 5849065 The prints on the knife<br />were planted.
5849065 5850458 Planted?
5851459 5852939 Christ...
5852939 5854854 And then, there's the hair<br />from the coat.
5854854 5856246 It's really impossible
5856246 5857378 that this was<br />the only thing we found.
5857378 5859510 I've been over this three times.
5859510 5862339 In my opinion, this jacket<br />was never anywhere
5862339 5863775 near the crime scene.
5863775 5865473 But we have the video.
5865473 5868389 Yeah... about that...
5868389 5869477 Fuck me!
5877398 5878790 Hey.
5878790 5880880 You're almost home.
5880880 5882359 One more step.
5882359 5883534 Okay.
5884622 5886886 <i>I'm gonna<br />make the call.</i>
5886886 5888626 You just sit tight.
5888626 5891151 Oh, did you get rid<br />of the notebook?
5891151 5892326 Yeah, I did.
5892326 5894067 Because this all goes to hell
5894067 5895329 if they find the notebook.
5895329 5896939 You understand?
5896939 5898332 It's gone.
5898332 5899507 <i>What did you do<br />with it?</i>
5899507 5900595 I burned it.
5900595 5901901 Okay.
5902510 5904555 I'll make the call<br />and it's over.
5904555 5906557 Yeah, good.
5906557 5908516 Hey, eh... X.
5909647 5911388 You should...
5911388 5914739 probably tell her I got<br />three dead bodies over here.
5914739 5917655 Do you have...<br />three dead bodies in there?
5917655 5919048 <i>I do.</i>
5919048 5920354 - Three?<br /><i>- </i>  [Knox] <i>Three.</i>
5923487 5924967 Oh, John.
5924967 5926055 Yeah.
5926882 5927927 Listen...
5932192 5933236 Good luck.
5937284 5938763 It's<br />almost imperceptible
5938763 5939851 to the naked eye,
5939851 5941766 but there's a jump there.
5941766 5944073 And if you go<br />into the root file,
5944073 5945640 someone clearly deleted
5945640 5947250 the original timestamp<br />and wrote over it.
5947250 5949078 Hard to spot, but it's there.
5949078 5950993 Meaning what?
5950993 5952560 He could have driven
5952560 5954170 in-and-out of the gate<br />on any day, at any time.
5954170 5956259 The footage was<br />simply spliced in.
5961743 5963484 Miles Knox was framed?
5963484 5965007 It's what it looks like.
5965007 5967662 It doesn't add up.<br />Nothing makes sense.
5967662 5969185 Detective Ikari.
5969185 5970708 - Not now.<br />- There's a phone call for you.
5970708 5972797 I said not now!<br />Okay, but...
5972797 5974234 This guy says<br />it has something to do
5974234 5975278 with John Knox.
5976453 5978194 This is detective Ikari.
5978194 5980370 <i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>
5980370 5982503 You should get up<br />to his bungalow
5982503 5984461 Why the hell would I do that?
5984461 5987029 <i>He's got<br />three dead bodies in there.</i>
5987029 5989075 <i>Who is this?</i>
5989075 5991381 An anonymous, concerned citizen.
6003567 6004916 Don't move! Do not move!
6006657 6008224 God bodies.
6008224 6010139 What happened?
6011358 6013012 Jesus, Knox.
6013012 6014491 Put your hands<br />behind your back.
6014491 6015623 All right.
6019018 6020019 Let's go.
6023631 6025328 Hey, hey! Ikari!
6025328 6026547 You're gonna want<br />to check this out.
6037732 6039386 Why would he...?
6039386 6040561 What the hell is this?
6041344 6042389 What?
6048612 6049961 Jesus Christ.
6052268 6054705 It was him.
6054705 6056403 My client won't be<br />making any statements.
6056403 6058274 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'll do the talking again.
6058840 6060059 You can wait outside.
6062452 6063845 So, Miles.
6065499 6067501 We know you didn't kill<br />Andrew Palmer.
6069111 6071635 What?<br />You're in the clear.
6071635 6073333 We're dropping all the charges.
6073333 6074943 You'll walk out of here<br />in half an hour a free man.
6074943 6077685 But first, tell me again<br />how you cut your hand.
6079513 6080557 On a broken glass.
6081471 6082864 Where?
6082864 6084474 At my father's house.
6084474 6085867 Why were you there?
6085867 6087086 Don't say anything.
6095137 6097705 At least...<br />tell me about your dad.
6097705 6099315 In general terms.
6099315 6100490 Don't.<br />- Wait.
6104190 6105365 In general terms?
6108324 6109760 A lousy jerk.
6109760 6111675 And a hothead?
6111675 6113764 Yeah, that's right.<br />He's abusive.
6113764 6116419 He's a despicable human being.
6116419 6118029 See, I get that.
6118029 6119944 But how big a prick<br />do you need to be...
6121511 6123252 to frame your own son<br />for murder?
6127474 6128910 I don't follow.
6128910 6130607 I got all the evidence.
6130607 6133219 Everything he used to frame you<br />was in his house.
6133219 6135917 He planted your prints<br />on the murder weapon,
6135917 6137527 hid it in your wall,
6137527 6139312 put the victim's blood<br />on your clothes,
6139312 6141531 his hair on your clothes.
6141531 6143142 Put your blood
6143142 6144447 from that broken glass<br />at the murder scene.
6144447 6145666 Why would he do that?
6146971 6148582 Why does he hate you so much?
6156677 6157808 'Cause I turned him in.
6159332 6160898 What do you mean?
6160898 6162117 The tax case<br />he went to prison for.
6162857 6164598 I was the one<br />who called the IRS.
6164598 6166034 Mhm... no.
6166034 6167122 The file says that was<br />someone named--
6167122 6168297 File's wrong.
6169385 6170430 It was me.
6190189 6192539 We never could tie<br />that gun to you.
6192539 6194193 Looks like you got away<br />with that one.
6196499 6197935 But just between us...
6199807 6202244 tell me.
6202244 6203985 It was you who shot Muncie,<br />wasn't it?
6213124 6214213 Muncie coming?
6215431 6216519 Muncie is dead.
6217433 6218739 You killed him.
6222612 6224005 They have newspapers here.
6224005 6225485 Muncie likes<br />to read the newspaper.
6239673 6241501 0-5-2-3!
6245156 6246245 Sorry.
6249073 6250118 He's not doing well.
6252468 6254035 Why do you wanna see him?
6254035 6255689 He tried to frame you.
6255689 6257299 Yeah, I mean...
6257299 6259780 He still killed the man<br />who raped my daughter.
6259780 6262391 And that's okay<br />with you? Murder?
6262391 6264915 If I could, I'd dig Palmer up<br />and I'd kill him again.
6267353 6270965 By the way, they're moving him<br />to a medical facility tomorrow.
6270965 6272662 I tried to get<br />a move sooner, but...
6273750 6274882 bureaucracy.
6277232 6278668 He went so fast, didn't he?
6279974 6281280 Fortunately for you.
6282585 6283934 How do you mean?
6283934 6285936 If he hadn't been<br />losing his mind,
6285936 6288025 he might have gotten away<br />with framing you.
6288025 6289157 Lucky for me, then.
6291986 6293030 Yeah.
6319840 6321668 Hey, Dad.
6321668 6322756 Is it Sunday?
6324366 6327064 No, no. It's not.
6327064 6328327 It's Wednesday, Dad.
6329850 6331112 - Why?<br />- Well...
6333549 6334855 My son likes football.
6337684 6338728 Is that so?
6338728 6339816 Yeah.
6342341 6344343 Sometimes we go<br />to the Rose Bowl.
6349304 6351001 I bet he loves that.
6351001 6352394 Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
6354440 6355441 But...
6364711 6365799 Sunday...
6368541 6369585 I love you, Dad.
6378072 6379116 Yeah.
6451145 6453321 Who wants to get beat?<br />- I don't know it.
