145722 147390 Cassie, can I have some coffee?
147457 148690 [Cassie] Okay.
150059 151094 [clears throat]
151760 153996 You heard about this broad<br />out in Weasley?
154062 157933 Oh, old-school,<br />newspaper, I like it.
158000 162004 Yeah... You know, the news<br />does come on your phone now,<br />it's a new thing.
162070 164438 Says the man<br />with ten thousand books.
164504 166107 Hmm. Thank you.
166173 169276 Makes her husband breakfast,<br />for 35 years.
169343 175415 One day, she starts putting<br />a little bit of antifreeze on<br />his orange juice every morning.
175482 177549 Why, was he cold?
179151 181652 [Muncie] What we got here?
181719 185790 Oh... "Empiricism<br />and the Philosophy of Mind".
185858 188059 [laughs]<br />Bunch of crock.
190361 191929 Wilfrid Sellars wrote this?
191996 195698 Yeah, interesting guy.<br />You know Wilfrid Sellars?
195765 197401 No, but I know Peter Sellars.
197467 199568 -[laughing]<br />-Okay...
202005 204974 It took this guy<br />eight months to die<br />from the antifreeze.
206175 207742 That's dedication.
207809 210112 You gotta give her points<br />for tenacity.
210179 212514 Come on.<br />Eight months?
212579 214748 Can you imagine hating<br />anyone that much?
214815 218186 Honestly? I can think<br />of a few candidates, yeah.
218253 219320 How did they catch her?
219386 221455 Mmm... doesn't say.
221522 223689 Maybe they...<br />[laughs]
223756 227261 Maybe when they tried<br />to embalm the guy,<br />the formaldehyde wouldn't set.
227327 231364 "I pumped two barrels<br />of that shit into him<br />and it keeps leaking out."
231431 233866 Put him in the deep freeze<br />and he's still warm.
233933 237436 [laughs]<br />That's good, that's good.
237502 240372 -Thank you.<br />-Hi there, Cassie.
240439 243341 Cassie, can I get a coffee?
243408 244641 Already got you.
245809 249113 I guess I need it.
249180 250314 [sighs]
252282 253782 You're such a skinny dude.
253850 256152 Where you put all that?
256219 259322 My old man said I have<br />a hollow cock.
259389 261023 [laughs] Really?
261090 263992 Your father said that,<br />"hollow cock".<br />Interesting.
264059 266261 Yeah, he's a philosopher, too.
266328 268030 [laughs]
272400 274302 I'm going to go<br />right to the airport from here.
275336 277871 I have to go out of town<br />for a couple of days.
277938 279638 -You? What for?<br />-Yeah.
279705 281541 Personal stuff, no big deal.
281607 285077 I'll be back the day<br />after tomorrow.<br />Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.
286011 287880 -Personal?<br />-Yeah.
287947 289315 Good.
289882 292284 Because if Jericho found out<br />you went out of town on a job...
292351 294419 Give me a little credit,<br />I don't have a death wish.
294486 296221 Then why are you even going?
296287 298423 Like I said, personal.
298490 299924 No big deal.
299991 302658 I'll be back tomorrow.
302725 304261 -Okay.<br />-[Knox] Yeah.
311766 313136 [utensils clattering]
315404 316771 Are you okay?
317572 319274 Good.
319341 320774 [Muncie] Okay...
322643 324012 I'm going to get the check.
324079 326247 The check? We just got<br />the plate of food.
326313 329583 I know but I...<br />don't want to be late,<br />I have to get to the airport.
329649 331485 You got five minutes<br />to eat some food.
331552 334720 -[Knox] Hurry up,<br />take five minutes.<br />-Jesus Christ...
337056 340193 All right, anything<br />comes up, call me.
340260 341628 What the hell?
341693 343462 When did you get<br />the new car?
343529 346365 Oh... Eh... Oh.
349568 352702 So, you're not even going to<br />tell me where you're going now.
352769 354539 I'll tell you when I come back.
354605 356374 [grunts]

365115 366149 Dog.
374390 375789 Ehm...
376925 378893 [grunts and clicks tongue]
382664 383897 Car.
385232 387067 [loud buzzing]

412356 414791 [clattering]
416993 418228 [door opening]
420296 421331 How are you today?
422498 425200 Well... you tell me.
425267 429605 My initial suspicions<br />were incorrect.
429671 431306 It's not Alzheimer's.
433174 434675 Okay.
434741 436776 What is it?
436844 440213 You're suffering<br />from a condition known<br />as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
440280 443749 It presents initially in much<br />the same way as Alzheimer's.
443817 445085 So, what's the difference?
445151 446519 Speed of progression.
449355 453392 I'm guessing...<br />you don't mean it's slower.
455394 457428 In your case,<br />it's incredibly fast.
463001 464469 What's the treatment?
464535 465836 There's no treatment.
468639 472142 The thing you have to<br />remember about dementia
472209 474844 is the thought-feeling<br />connection.
474910 477013 You have a thought,<br />creates a feeling.
477079 480182 You lose a thought,<br />you're left with a feeling.
480249 483051 So, you'll be going along<br />and...
483118 487055 all of a sudden, you'll be<br />unreasonably happy<br />and you won't know why.
487122 492526 Or you'll have<br />this wave of depression<br />and you won't know why.
492593 496363 You'll find yourself...<br />[echoing] forgetting people,
496430 499632 even those you have<br />a connection with.
499699 502835 You'll become displaced<br />in time and space...<br />[distorting and fading]
502902 505505 [muffled sound]
511109 516113 Right now, you're mostly lucid<br />with small patches of confusion<br />and mental lapse.
516180 517915 So, then it'll reverse.
517982 520017 The moments of lucidity<br />will become the exception
520084 521985 and eventually,<br />go away altogether.
522052 524054 How much time do I have?
524120 526589 It's progressing<br />more aggressively<br />than I would like...
526656 528224 -Uhm...<br />-How much time?
529926 534697 You're looking at weeks,<br />not months.
534763 540168 If you have any arrangements<br />to make, I suggest you do so<br />as quickly as possible.
540234 543037 Do you have family<br />that can take care of you?
545640 548241 -None that would.<br />-[doctor] All right.
548308 552579 Then, I suggest you look<br />into care facilities.
555014 558317 This is a very good place...
558384 560019 in your area.
569694 571595 I'm sorry.
571662 574264 That's okay, doc.
574331 577067 Even if I hated you<br />for telling me,
577134 579136 I'd forget soon enough.

607694 610563 [Annie] Secrets are secrets,<br />so I can't tell you.
610630 612898 [Knox laughs]
612965 617703 -[Annie] I finished<br />the last book you lent me.<br />-[Knox] Oh, yeah?
617770 620471 What did you think?
620538 623374 I liked it but<br />the end was stupid.
623441 625710 Really?
625778 629579 He just lets them chop off<br />his head while the other guy<br />walks away?
629646 636585 Well, see... His whole<br />character arc leads<br />to that moment. You know?
636652 640923 It's a... sacrifice<br />for the greater good,<br />you know?
640990 643759 Mmm...<br />like the end of "Casablanca"?
643827 645895 Yeah, like the end<br />of "Casablanca," exactly.
645960 648296 It was bullshit, too.
648363 650365 Rick would take the girl<br />10 times out of 10.
650432 654368 "A far, far better thing"<br />my ass.
654435 655904 Wow.
655969 658372 Is everyone from Kraków<br />that cynical?
658439 661174 I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.
663676 666112 What day is it?
666179 668714 -Thursday?<br />-No, no, I mean...
668782 670081 I mean what date.
670148 671716 The fifth, does that<br />mean something?
671784 673820 [sighs]
673886 676354 It's my son's birthday,
676421 680991 who hasn't spoken with me<br />many, many years.
684863 687697 Why does he hate you so much?
687765 693336 I'm what the Science journals<br />refer to as a "lousy father."
693403 694804 Mmm...
694871 698106 -He found out<br />what I did for a living.<br />-[woman] Yeah?
698173 700509 -Yeah.<br />-[woman] What do you do<br />for a living?
700576 701811 I work for the IRS.
701877 704078 Just like that, I hate you too.
705613 710250 I've been coming here<br />once a week for almost...<br />four years
710317 713788 and that's the first thing<br />you've said about yourself.
713855 717357 What do you want to know?<br />I'll tell you anything,<br />just ask me.
717424 719960 Is that your real name,<br />Aristotle?
720025 722127 No, it's a nickname
722194 725664 the guys in my platoon<br />gave me, I was<br />in the first Gulf War
725731 729768 and I used to read a lot<br />of books, like philosophy<br />and... like that.
730735 732303 [phone vibrating]
737040 738475 I got to go.
739911 742212 [sighs]
750152 753856 The thing with your son<br />explains a lot, though.
753923 755690 What do you mean?
755758 759094 You know how they say<br />haunted houses have<br />cold spots?
760327 765099 Stand in certain areas,<br />and a chill goes down your spine<br />like an artic breeze.
765165 766935 What the hell<br />you're talking about?
767002 770537 That's what's like here.<br />You walk in the door<br />and you feel it.
770603 772672 Only it isn't a ghost.
772739 774040 What is it?
774107 776208 Loneliness.
777777 780679 See you next Thursday,<br />not really Aristotle.
785149 787418 -[Muncie] This guy's<br />a piece of work.<br />-[Knox] I don't care.
787485 789453 Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>
789520 791088 Why do we always<br />have to go through this?
791155 792689 Why do we have to<br />go through what?
792757 795026 You ask me if I want to know<br />the details of the job
795091 797594 and I say, "no, I really don't"<br />and then you tell me<br />the details of the job
797661 800296 and then I say, "shut up" and<br />we go through it again and again
800362 802298 and we always go through<br />the same thing<br />every fucking time!
802364 805501 The question is,<br />why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
805568 806502 Ready.
806569 811040 [mariachi music in background]
811105 814509 Hey, this could be<br />my last job for a while.
814576 816844 What the fuck is going on, John?
816911 819013 Nothing, I just need to<br />take care of a few things
819079 820414 I'll clear it with Jericho.
820480 822516 Okay, how long are you<br />going to be out?
823785 824818 Hard to say.
825819 827754 Come on.<br />Let's go.
827821 830690 This motherfucker sells<br />men for human labor,<br />that's a thing now.
830757 832625 Jesus Christ.
832692 834225 -I thought trafficking<br />was like sex shit.<br />-Same thing every time.
834292 836127 Didn't we just go<br />through this at the car?
838263 841032 Why don't you care<br />who the guy is?
841098 846037 Because in ten minutes,<br />Tommy, he's not going to<br />be anybody.
846103 847538 Let's go get this done.

1014952 1015986 Yeah.
1017121 1019255 Well, we were...
1019322 1021791 expecting only one person<br />to be there.
1022759 1023893 We got split up.
1025094 1028865 I guess he figured...<br />I don't know,<br />we could cover more ground.
1030297 1033400 And I heard shots...
1034202 1036303 [muffled sound]
1037504 1038739 Christ, Tommy.
1040975 1042308 [Muncie moaning]
1042375 1043844 I didn't mean to.
1047346 1050382 -Knox...<br />-I'm sorry, Tommy.
1054219 1055453 [thud]
1059925 1060959 Yeah, he was.
1062994 1067031 <i>Yeah. I made sure the scene</i><br /><i>was clean and then I left.</i>
1073335 1074537 Okay.
1075437 1076672 Thank you.
1082710 1084013 [camera shutter clicking]
1088615 1089851 [camera shutter clicking]
1094122 1096056 You're buying this?
1096123 1098125 Five bullets, three victims?
1098192 1100693 Had to happen fast.
1100761 1102995 Are you thinking<br />there's a third shooter?
1103062 1104696 There's no evidence of that.
1107499 1109836 Growing up, I hated my mother.
1109902 1111502 Is that right?
1111569 1115941 She was a stereotype,<br />overbearing, Asian,<br />hellicopter mom.
1116007 1118210 An "A" minus meant<br />I didn't have any pride.
1118276 1119810 My mother was a drunk, so...
1119877 1121544 -This is about me.<br />-Sorry.
1121611 1124480 She hates my chosen profession<br />but, ironically,
1124547 1127784 made me a good detective.
1127851 1130987 Realizing her wanting me<br />to excel was about her<br />and not me,
1131054 1132322 [camera shutter clicking]
1132387 1134224 gave me my first lesson<br />in motive.
1134290 1136892 She taught me that the details<br />were important.
1136959 1139761 The answers lie<br />in the little things<br />other people,
1139828 1141797 she meant white people,<br />overlook.
1141864 1144431 With all due respect,<br />is this going somewhere?
1144497 1146100 There's water<br />all over the floor.
1146167 1149203 That means the shower was on<br />when the curtain came down.
1149270 1151305 [Rale] Okay.
1151371 1153439 -So?<br />-So,
1153505 1157543 he killed them,<br />they killed him, all in a hurry,<br />bang, bang, bang.
1159179 1160578 Who turned off the shower?

1204385 1206053 Sit down.<br />Want a drink?
1206120 1209322 Yeah. Yeah, whisky.
1209389 1211925 So...
1211991 1215328 you just swing by<br />to say hello?
1215395 1217063 No, closing out.
1217129 1219630 I have to do it<br />pretty quick, too.
1219697 1221400 -Quick?<br />-Yeah.
1221465 1223534 -Jericho knows?<br />-He can't.
1224303 1226436 That makes it tough.
1226503 1227972 Raise your commission, I guess.
1229840 1234177 I'm uh...<br />I'm going away.
1234244 1236046 For good this time.
1236112 1238949 And I don't want this<br />blowing back on Jericho.
1239015 1240150 What happened?
1240216 1241750 A job went South.
1241817 1245354 I set the scene out to buy<br />myself some time but...
1245421 1248556 -It's not going to last long.<br />-I'm sure about that.
1248623 1250590 Three people,
1250657 1252592 all shot each other<br />with the same gun.
1253560 1255029 Yeah, that's not good.
1256397 1258332 My gun.
1258398 1259700 -That's worse.<br />-Yeah.
1260499 1263437 So time is of the essence.<br />How do you have your capital.
1263502 1267974 Mostly cash.<br />Got some paintings<br />you got to sell. Some stones.
1268040 1270943 -That's simple enough.<br />-Yeah.
1274846 1276381 A list of three people.
1276448 1278482 All three, equal shares.
1278549 1281152 Nothing in here<br />for Muncie's family?
1281219 1282820 Muncie didn't have anybody.
1284654 1287858 I can't have any of this<br />touch those people.
1287925 1289860 This money has to be clean.
1292594 1295965 Gather your assets,<br />I'll set it up.
1296032 1299201 -A couple of days.<br />-Hey, this stays<br />between you and me.
1299267 1303171 Yeah, and I'm going to tell who?
1303238 1305107 All right.
1305173 1306574 All right, thanks.
1311678 1313680 [birds singing]
1320887 1322521 [machinery beeping]
1334564 1337835 -What's up?<br />-This key doesn't work<br />on the... uh...
1339337 1341537 -The thing, the...<br />-Lock?
1341604 1343572 -Lock, yeah.<br />-All right.
1343639 1346609 Yeah, the green ones,<br />they go to our other facility,<br />out in Van Nuys.
1346675 1347911 Okay.
1349644 1351080 Hey, could you do me a favor?
1351147 1353949 Could you... uh... write down<br />the number...
1354016 1355617 -The address?<br />-The address.
1355684 1357085 Yeah, got you.
1359287 1360855 [crickets chirping]
1368362 1370064 [doorbell]
1373332 1374867 [knocking]
1380705 1382174 [aggressive knocking]
1384575 1386745 [doorbell]
1386812 1389013 [wood floor creaking]
1390247 1392249 [aggressive knocking]
1406762 1408330 Sorry, I didn't mean to...
1408397 1411066 just to show up like this,<br />I should've called.
1411133 1414702 I didn't mean to ambush you,<br />I'm sorry.
1414769 1416304 Do I know you?
1419073 1422109 Okay, I guess I deserve that.
1422175 1426346 You got to know I wouldn't<br />be here unless I was desperate.
1426413 1428882 Okay? I need your help.
1431217 1434353 Dad, could you please<br />just talk to me?
1434420 1435653 Dad.
1436722 1438723 Miles... yeah.
1440158 1443795 Sure, Miles.<br />Come here.<br />Come on in.
1443862 1447998 Thank you, I just...<br />[clears throat]
1448065 1451301 -Have a seat.<br />-[exhales]
1451368 1456806 [glass clanking]
1456873 1460076 [cork popping]
1460143 1464746 No, no, no,<br />I'm... I'm sober.<br />Nine years.
1471651 1473921 That's your blood?
1473988 1478092 Yeah, my hand is... Uhm...
1478159 1481060 I cut it in a...
1481127 1484030 This is my blood<br />and that's someone else's.
1484097 1485632 Holy fuck!
1485698 1488167 [sobbing]
1488233 1489268 [exhales]
1491537 1492938 I fucked up.
1494773 1497341 I fucked up really bad.
1497408 1499677 Okay... okay.
1499744 1503181 Okay, take it easy.
1503247 1504881 Catch your breath.
1504948 1507150 -[exhales]<br />-Tell me what happened.
1510554 1512288 I killed someone.
1514023 1515791 Did they deserve killing?
1519662 1522030 Okay, start there.
1523565 1525833 [Miles] Okay.<br />[clears throat]
1525900 1529036 [exhales] You have<br />a granddaughter.
1529102 1532573 -Kaylee.<br />-How did you know about her?
1532639 1535375 Your mother told me,<br />right after she was born.
1537310 1539712 Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.
1539779 1543082 What is she, like 12? 13?
1543149 1545083 She's 16.
1545150 1546818 Here...
1551756 1554325 -Cute kid.<br />-Yeah.
1554391 1555426 She's a kid.
1558462 1560097 And she met this guy...
1561564 1563333 Online. This...
1563399 1565835 piece of shit!
1565902 1567837 The guy was 32 years old.
1567904 1572241 This son of a bitch<br />gets her pregnant.
1572307 1575010 She's 16 years old,<br />she's my little girl.
1575077 1579046 So, I go over<br />to his house, you know?
1579113 1582116 I was just going to put<br />the fear of God on him.
1582183 1585986 And I show up and he's...<br />[exhales and sniffs]
1586052 1588488 more than I expected.<br />Okay?
1588555 1590257 [sniffs]
1591391 1594226 He wouldn't shut up.<br />Just kept talking,
1594293 1596795 and talking and talking<br />about my fucking daughter.
1596862 1601166 Like, saying shit about her,<br />like... "she loves it,"<br />"She wanted more."
1601233 1605236 Called her "ripe."<br />Called her ripe, dad!
1605303 1609207 [groans] Fuck!<br />I just lost it.
1609274 1612476 So I grabbed a knife<br />and I sho...
1612542 1614811 I shoved it into his neck.
1617682 1620082 And I stabbed him.
1620149 1623252 I just... couldn't stop.
1623319 1624520 [muffled scream]
1625454 1626855 I didn't care.
1628089 1630325 Because I wasn't even<br />in the room, I was...
1631459 1632494 [exhales]
1638767 1640000 Did you bury this guy?
1641001 1642402 Did I bury him?
1642468 1644270 [Knox] Yeah.
1644337 1646372 No, why?
1646439 1649409 Because if you did, I was<br />going to dig him up<br />and kill him again.
1650909 1652144 [exhales]
1653578 1654813 [exhales]
1655782 1657416 Oh, my God...
1658883 1660284 So, why did you come to me?
1664088 1666490 Are you kidding?<br />[laughs]
1667891 1670060 Well, I mean...
1670126 1674464 You're the only person<br />I know that can... I...<br />This isn't my world.
1674531 1678967 -I don't know how to...<br />-Get rid of a body.
1679034 1682672 I never asked you<br />for anything in my life.
1682739 1687842 Okay? And I'm here because<br />I had nowhere else to go.
1687909 1689911 Now you need me.
1689977 1692245 [Miles] Yeah,<br />that's what this is,<br />I'm desperate.
1692312 1695482 Okay? I'm so fucking desperate<br />that I'm here, at your house,
1695549 1698118 asking you for help.<br />Now, are you [shouting]<br />going to help me or not?
1698185 1701187 [crickets chirping]
1709194 1711029 Where's the murder weapon?
1736885 1738320 Here.
1738387 1740222 Put your clothes<br />in that plastic bag,
1740288 1742523 then take a shower<br />and scrub down everything.
1742590 1744726 Underneath the fingernails,<br />clean everything.
1744793 1748229 Then, afterwards,<br />I'm going to wrap and clean<br />that hand of yours.
1748295 1750430 -Then what?<br />-Then?
1750497 1755502 You go home to your wife<br />and you never<br />mention this again.
1755568 1757871 My whole life, I never<br />asked you for anything.
1757936 1761106 Yeah, you said that already.
1761173 1766043 Here, use that. I'm going to<br />need those boxers, too.
1770081 1773151 Hey, where's the body?
1845113 1847683 Write it down.<br />Write it down.
1877208 1880043 [suspenseful music]
1930054 1934191 [football match in Spanish]
1934258 1936794 [groaning]
1940898 1942132 [thud]
1970824 1971858 [grunting]
2055364 2057701 [crickets chirping]
2072246 2073715 There you are.
2076315 2077751 What are you doing?
2079086 2080319 Nothing.
2083824 2085692 I talked to her.
2087093 2088326 [Miles]<br />What did she say?
2090863 2092998 She wants you to take her.
2093065 2094099 [Miles] What?
2095199 2100105 Well, I assumed this would be...<br />you know, like,<br />a mother-daughter thing.
2100172 2102773 Well, apparently it isn't.
2104240 2105976 What happened to your hand?
2115350 2116852 I have to tell you something.
2121123 2124325 [tension music]
2126460 2127929 All right, what do we got?
2127995 2130330 Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.
2130397 2131833 We're waiting<br />for the Interpol jacket
2131899 2134701 but safe to say he wasn't<br />a model citizen.
2134768 2137070 The woman was local,<br />Annette Elmora.
2137137 2139438 Yeah, we're thinking<br />maybe he picked her up<br />at a club or something.
2139505 2142608 You know,<br />wrong place-wrong time<br />kind of thing.
2142675 2144910 Victim number three is<br />where it gets interesting.
2144977 2146244 Meet Thomas Muncie,
2146311 2147780 suspected hitter for Jericho.
2147847 2150280 Conspicuously missing<br />from the carnage,
2150347 2152449 this man, John Knox.
2152516 2156187 Traffic cam shot this<br />six blocks away<br />around the time of death.
2156253 2158122 Facial recognition flagged him.
2158188 2160958 -That could just be<br />a driver, though.<br />-We're sure this guy's a driver?
2161024 2162893 What's his jacket say?
2162960 2165394 Not much. He did a six-year<br />stretch for tax evasion
2165461 2167362 and that's only because<br />someone ratted them out.
2167429 2170465 Other than that<br />and his service record,<br />there's nothing on him.
2170532 2174069 Which means, whatever<br />this guy does for a living,<br />he's pretty good at it.
2174136 2175436 [Ikari] Smart, too.
2175503 2177271 According to the tax<br />auditor's notes,
2177338 2179306 John Knox holds two PhDs.
2179373 2182408 One in English Lit<br />and one in US History.
2182475 2184612 Even taught in Bucknell<br />a couple of years.
2184678 2187580 And we're thinking this guy<br />kills people for a living?
2187648 2188883 Why?
2188949 2191383 Hopefully, we'll get<br />to ask him ourselves.
2191450 2192952 What branch of service<br />was he in?
2193019 2196421 Army. He was a deep<br />reconnaissance officer.
2196488 2198556 Remind me what that is again?
2198624 2202127 Someone who goes off alone<br />behind enemy lines<br />for weeks at a time.
2202194 2205363 Then, maybe we just<br />bring him in as<br />a cooperating witness.
2205429 2207564 Friend-of-the-victim<br />kind of thing.
2207632 2209734 He might slip up<br />and give us something.
2209801 2211669 Does he seem like someone<br />who makes mistakes?
2211736 2215138 Hey, boss, check your texts.
2215205 2216840 [voices in radios]
2218541 2221912 Another body. And now,<br />we got three on my board<br />already.
2221978 2223979 Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.
2224046 2226282 That's your métier.
2226347 2228483 Métier? Really?
2229551 2232352 [salsa music playing]
2236557 2238325 -John Knox.<br />-Hey!
2238392 2239993 -Hi.<br />-Is he upstairs?
2240060 2241795 Yeah. I'm supposed to think<br />he's doing the books.
2241862 2244330 -What's he really doing?<br />-Watching TV.
2244397 2246499 -I married a little boy.<br />-Yeah.
2246566 2248433 Well, he married up,<br />that's for sure.
2248500 2249735 [Ludmilla laughs]
2253639 2256540 [Knox] Xavier!<br />Coming up.
2258877 2263447 [voices on TV]
2268551 2270955 Look at this skinny<br />son of a bitch.
2271021 2275291 They rescued him<br />from a big cat sanctuary.
2275390 2278194 Locals toss him stray dogs<br />in a cave
2278261 2280230 so he can have something to eat.
2280295 2282164 Kind of reminds me of you.
2282231 2284833 You know,<br />when I first found you<br />after your war.
2286567 2288003 I never ate a dog.
2289770 2292607 [Philo] What's this,<br />grocery list?
2292673 2295209 It's a plan,<br />and I'm going to need<br />your help.
2295276 2296611 Just read it.
2300280 2301982 Hey, Ludmilla looks good.
2303083 2309154 She still hasn't realized<br />what a mistake she made<br />marrying me.
2309221 2311156 You're learning any Russian?
2311223 2314692 Just the stuff she says<br />I need to know.
2314759 2317362 "Yes, dear."<br />"Please."
2317427 2318863 All the essentials.
2322366 2324568 Okay, lay it on me.
2326136 2327971 Stabbed at least 17 times.
2329605 2332440 I put time of death between<br />3:00 and 8:00 p.m.<br />yesterday afternoon.
2332507 2335311 I'll get a more precise<br />time frame when<br />I get him to the shop.
2335378 2337445 -All right.<br />-Yeah.
2337512 2339614 Thanks, bro.
2339681 2341783 There's no murder weapon yet,
2341850 2344219 but there's a knife missing<br />from that kitchen block.
2344286 2346654 I mean, it doesn't even look<br />like anything was stolen.
2346720 2350891 He's got an expensive watch<br />on his wrist, he's got a wallet<br />full of large bills...
2350958 2354861 I know this racist<br />piece of crap. His name<br />is Andrew Palmer.
2354928 2358197 He moves cash around<br />for the Aryan Brotherhood<br />but... he's a cog.
2358264 2360900 -Not a shot caller.<br />-So, he winds up dead.
2360967 2363135 There's no big mystery there.
2363201 2366605 But he also did a stretch<br />a few years back<br />for kiddie porn.
2366672 2369574 And this...<br />this doesn't look<br />like business.
2369641 2371575 This looks personal.
2371642 2374712 Detective, gate guard out front<br />says he was knocked out<br />last night.
2375913 2376948 I got this.
2378848 2381885 Bag the victim's computers,<br />any flash drives and discs.
2381952 2384154 -What are we looking for?<br />-You'll know when you see it.
2384220 2387289 Oh, and see if you can find<br />his phone, he didn't have it<br />on him.
2387356 2388590 Got it.
2390225 2393195 [voices on radios]
2394896 2397065 So, how long have you known?
2397131 2399000 Uh... not long.
2400134 2402637 Doc says this thing<br />moves pretty fast.
2402704 2405138 Oh, Jesus, Knox.
2405205 2407941 I can't think of anything worse.
2408008 2409943 Except maybe your pecker<br />stops working.
2410010 2416082 Actually, I'm looking forward<br />to forgetting some things.
2416148 2421353 Muncie... Christ.<br />I can't imagine what the--
2421419 2423054 That's like me shooting you.
2423121 2425390 I don't even remember<br />doing it. I mean, I know...
2425457 2428892 I know I did it but I have<br />no recollection of the event.
2428959 2431095 Well, count your blessings.
2432162 2436666 -This is a radical plan.<br />-It's the only way<br />I can figure it.
2436733 2440403 This kid's DNA is<br />all over the place.
2440470 2444039 He actually bled on the guy,<br />he's got his fingerprints<br />everywhere.
2444106 2446875 He might as well just<br />signed off on the job.
2446942 2448877 Still, if you don't<br />pull this off,
2448944 2453080 -you're both fucked.<br />-[Knox] Yeah.
2453147 2455683 -I'm fucked either way.<br />-That's true.
2455750 2458152 That's why I'm asking you<br />to help me.
2458219 2463757 Look, just check in with me.<br />Just check in with me<br />now and then. You know?
2463823 2466760 -Make sure I'm on point.<br />-Yeah, of course, sure.
2466826 2472197 Just so you don't ever thing<br />this stupid plan is my idea.
2472264 2473999 I'm sure you'll remind me.
2476101 2477802 You want to know<br />the funny thing?
2477869 2480438 Let's say I pull this thing off,
2480505 2482707 I won't even know<br />if I did it or not.
2482774 2484975 It's encouraging.
2485042 2487778 This plan is<br />precision work, man.
2487844 2489946 -One hair out of place--<br />-Oh, I know.
2491448 2493482 I know.
2493549 2495718 I know I could pull this off.
2495785 2497219 The question is, can you?
2498287 2501423 So, you didn't see his face,<br />didn't see his height, nothing?
2501489 2502524 -No.<br />-Okay.
2502590 2504025 All right, thank you.
2506194 2507128 [blows out]
2507195 2508129 Beautiful day.
2508196 2509164 Sure.
2509963 2512132 What did you get?<br />Don't suppose he can<br />ID our killer.
2512199 2514334 No, he was attacked<br />from behind.
2514401 2517470 He didn't see anything.<br />Happened a little before<br />three in the morning.
2517537 2521340 Doesn't fit the timeline.<br />M.E. said he was killed<br />before 8:00 p.m.
2521407 2523810 [Rale] So you think the attack<br />on the guard is unrelated?
2523876 2526311 It's related, I'm just...<br />not sure how, yet.
2526378 2528548 They get anything off<br />these security cameras?
2528613 2532384 Well, that part is weird.<br />They feed into a DVR<br />in the utility closet.
2532451 2535052 -There's no hard drive.<br />-You mean it doesn't work?
2535119 2537455 No, I mean the tech<br />couldn't get playback
2537521 2539690 so we opened up the DVR<br />and looked inside,<br />no hard drive.
2539757 2541859 -Found his phone.<br />-[Ikari sighs]
2541926 2544661 Can't open it, though.<br />It's got one of those facial<br />recognition locks on it.
2544727 2547964 -Okay, head back inside.<br />-Okay.
2548031 2551967 -What am I looking for?<br />-His face. I assume<br />that's where it is...
2553102 2554136 Right.

2606282 2607415 [knocking]
2612454 2613822 Did you forget I was coming?
2614756 2616724 Oh... no, no.
2625198 2626232 How are you?
2629502 2632237 Good. I'm...
2632304 2634173 kind of knotted up.
2634239 2635440 That's why I'm here.
2638677 2640778 I finished the book.
2640845 2644583 It was.. better but I knew<br />he was going to die<br />in the end.
2644650 2646450 He kind of had to.
2646517 2648818 I'll find you another one here.
2652222 2653356 This is your ex?
2655725 2657726 Yeah.
2657793 2661397 -Well, she's gorgeous.<br />-Yeah.
2661463 2663365 Hey...<br />[mumbles]
2664233 2669003 put that down--<br />[distorted and silence]
2669070 2670838 Why don't I get ready?
2676410 2677744 Fuck me.
2697262 2701031 -These paintings are all real?<br />-Yeah.
2701098 2704835 -It's safer than cash.<br />-Are they worth a lot?
2704902 2708738 -Why do you have them?<br />-Part of my cashing-out process.
2708805 2710206 What?
2713076 2717212 -What do you mean "cashing out"?<br />-Forget I said it. Forget it.
2718548 2720115 Did you find me something?
2720182 2723985 [distant and echoing voice]
2724051 2727421 Hello? You picked me<br />another book?
2728923 2730323 You want a book?
2730390 2734595 Knox, are you having<br />a stroke or something?
2734662 2737931 -Maybe you should sit down?<br />-You know what? Maybe...
2739798 2741333 Maybe it's better<br />if you just go.
2743769 2745371 Good idea.
2775598 2777432 Sorry.
2777499 2781268 I just got a...<br />Got a thing I got to do.
2781335 2784872 -Same time next week?<br />-Yeah.
2786040 2787473 Yeah, you bet,<br />next week.
2787541 2789610 Are you sure you're<br />going to be okay?
2789677 2790977 Never better.
2803523 2808459 [suspenseful music]
2821136 2822371 [shutter clicking]
2825908 2827644 [elevator bell]
2827711 2829377 Here.
2830713 2832080 -Hi.<br />-Hi.
2832146 2835216 We have an appointment.<br />Last name's Knox.
2835283 2837618 Okay. All right, here it is.
2837685 2839554 You must be Kaylee.<br />And you are?
2839620 2842623 I'm the father...<br />Her father, not the...
2842690 2844624 -I'm her dad.<br />-Okay, dad.
2844691 2847828 See, sign here.<br />Initial here, here<br />and here.
2847893 2851497 Before we do the procedure,<br />the law says we have to<br />ask you a few questions.
2851565 2854065 Not about<br />the father of the child<br />or anything like that,
2854132 2856868 just to make sure<br />that <i>you</i> want to be here.
2856935 2858704 That'd be okay?
2858771 2860539 I guess so.
2860606 2861639 [nurse] Good.
2862707 2864875 Now it's your turn.
2864942 2869212 I need a couple of signatures<br />from you, starting here<br />on the consent form.
2875753 2878353 -[nurse] All right,<br />guys, have a sit.<br />-[both] Thank you.

2895669 2899406 [keeps vibrating]
2901542 2902776 Xavier, hey.
2902842 2905144 I'm calling to make sure<br />you're on track.
2905210 2909816 -On track with what?<br />-Your cockamamie plan is what.
2909883 2912316 You got your notepad?
2912383 2913985 Yeah.
2915353 2917556 Yeah, I'm on track,<br />don't worry about it.
2917623 2919089 He says "don't worry."
2919891 2923026 Do me a favor,<br />unlock your phone.
2923093 2925630 <i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>
2925696 2928598 - <i>Okay?</i><br />-Why?
2928665 2933102 Well, what if you need help<br />and you can't remember the code.
2933169 2936371 Right... right, okay.
2936438 2937873 Yeah, got it.
2937939 2939542 [sighs]
2942444 2946581 -You're there?<br />-Huh? Yeah.
2946648 2949283 I feel like I'm getting worse<br />every hour.
2952786 2954153 I'm running out of time.
2954220 2958625 So, stop wasting it<br />talking to me. Okay?

3034525 3037193 What?<br />I'm in the middle of dinner.
3038127 3039863 It's not even 4:30.
3039930 3043465 Oh, I'm almost 90.<br />Dinner time is<br />very important to me.
3043533 3045033 What's up?
3045100 3047469 [Knox] <i>Yeah, I'm looking at</i><br /><i>some kind of locker key.</i>
3047537 3049804 <i>Do you know where</i><br /><i>that's from?</i>
3049871 3052139 [Philo] <i>You never confided</i><br /><i>in me where you keep</i><br /><i>all your money.</i>
3052206 3055342 I'm a crook, you know?
3055409 3057578 All right. Great, thanks,<br />I'll figure it out.
3057645 3061047 Hey, wait a minute.<br />Did you take the passcode<br />off your phone?
3061114 3063717 Ehm... yeah, I'm going to<br />do that now.
3063784 3065485 I'll do it right now. Okay?
3065552 3068488 Thanks.<br />Say hi to Becky from me.
3068555 3072090 -Wait, who?<br />- <i>Becky.</i>
3072157 3074458 Ehm... okay.
3074526 3076828 -All right.<br />-How's he doing?
3076895 3080298 -He just called you Becky.<br />-Who's this Becky?
3080364 3082098 She was one of my wives.
3082165 3085235 I divorced her before<br />you were born, baby.
3085302 3088706 This business with Knox...<br />It's not good.
3088773 3090874 No.
3090941 3092308 It's not.

3203707 3206441 I ordered some food,<br />this place has great ribs.
3206509 3210746 I'm a vegan.<br />Should we...?
3210813 3212781 Should we be meeting<br />in public like this?
3212847 3214281 No one knows us here.
3216283 3219453 -How's the hand?<br />-Well, it...
3219521 3222056 -hurts.<br />-If anyone asks you about it,
3222122 3225626 you cut on broken glass.<br />You were at my house,<br />we were having a drink.
3225693 3228595 What? Why would I be<br />at your place?
3228662 3231564 You were looking for<br />your old Hot Wheels,<br />make something up.
3235535 3237136 -How are you doing?<br />-How am I doing?
3237201 3238937 Yeah, uhm...
3239938 3242641 Spent the day<br />at the abortion clinic with...
3242708 3246610 my 16-year-old daughter<br />so, bad, I guess.
3246677 3248411 Pretty bad.
3248479 3251916 Not sleeping, not eating.<br />I haven't eaten since yesterday.
3251982 3253283 Uhm...
3253349 3255185 My hair is falling out.
3255250 3257687 So, I'm about to lose<br />my goddamn mind.
3257754 3260690 Okay, okay.<br />You need to get a grip.
3260757 3262558 I don't know how<br />to do this, I'm not...
3262624 3264460 I'm not like you,<br />you know?
3265961 3267196 I'm not a killer.
3267261 3268497 [exhales]
3272232 3274267 You are, though.
3274334 3276704 What?
3276771 3279438 A killer.
3279506 3282642 Damn good one, too.<br />Not half-assed.
3282709 3286444 I was out at the scene.<br />Let me put it to you<br />this way:
3288080 3292485 that wasn't what you call<br />a proportional response.
3292551 3294986 -I lost it.<br />-Understandable.
3295053 3298223 But now I need you<br />to pull it all together, okay?
3298288 3301291 -You're like<br />a walking confession.<br />-I'll try harder.
3301358 3304027 No, do the opposite.<br />Relax.
3305829 3306864 Okay.
3308899 3312001 [plates clanking]
3312068 3315638 [exhales deeply]
3316404 3317640 Is she your only kid?
3320642 3327347 We... we lost one early on,<br />a miscarriage.
3327413 3329917 -Sorry, it's tough.<br />-Yeah.
3332086 3334255 More on Cheryl, actually.
3334320 3336923 What does she do, Cheryl?
3336990 3339159 Teaches fourth grade,
3339225 3341127 public school.
3341194 3345063 Yeah and... kids love her.
3345130 3347599 All right.<br />Boy, you guys are busy.
3347666 3350368 Working parents,<br />on the go all the time.
3350434 3353436 What's the typical day?
3353504 3356808 Tomorrow for instance,<br />what would you do tomorrow?
3356874 3361343 Go get breakfast somewhere<br />and walk around<br />Largemouth Village
3361410 3363747 and then Kaylee has<br />soccer and...
3363814 3366750 -You now.<br />-Do that. Do that.
3366817 3368751 -Just do that.<br />-Do that?
3368818 3372221 -[Knox] Yeah.<br />-We can't,<br />she's laid up in bed.
3372288 3375758 Don't vary your routine,<br />do what you would normally do.
3381462 3382864 [sighs]
3395708 3397409 What happened to vegan?
3397476 3399344 Fuck it, I'm starving.
3399411 3402247 I've been starving<br />for six years.
3402314 3406518 You ever take the family<br />up to the cabin?
3406585 3409453 -The hunting cabin?<br />-Yeah.
3409520 3412489 I sold it, remember?<br />You signed the papers<br />two years ago.
3415659 3417359 These are so fucking good.
3417994 3419996 Yeah.
3420063 3421865 I remember that.<br />You know anything about the...
3422632 3424534 about if the owners...<br />I mean, if they use it...
3424601 3426235 full time or...
3426301 3427302 part time?
3427368 3428971 -The buyers?<br />-Yeah.
3430839 3432975 Well, I'm not renting it<br />to them. They...
3433041 3434407 I sold it to them.
3434475 3436210 They bought it, they own it.<br />I have no...
3436277 3438212 -Right.<br />-Why would I know<br />what they do?
3438279 3439914 Okay, listen to me.
3442082 3443450 You just need to...
3444416 3445585 hold it together, okay?
3445652 3448355 We're almost there,<br />couple of days.
3448420 3449656 Okay.
3451223 3452458 Look at me.
3456195 3458162 I need you to use my balls.
3459330 3460632 What?
3460698 3463434 They're gonna connect Kaylee<br />to the dead guy.
3463501 3465003 Then they're gonna<br />question you.
3465069 3467638 If you don't think you have<br />the balls for it, use mine.
3467704 3470908 Do whatever you think<br />I would do<br />if I was on that chair.
3472075 3473409 All right?
3473477 3474744 What?
3481851 3483718 I never hated you, you know?
3485453 3486755 [Knox] Well...
3489124 3490791 Be understandable if you did.
3490858 3492693 You were a good dad<br />in your way.
3494194 3495729 I remember a lot of good.
3497431 3500533 I remember ball games.<br />I remember you teaching me...
3500600 3501868 how to hunt.
3503303 3506005 I remember you letting me<br />eat pancakes in the pool.
3509441 3512244 I worshiped you.
3512311 3513912 I wanted to be<br />just like you.
3516847 3518816 Then, you know, I found out.
3521285 3522520 And I thought...
3525055 3526556 [sighs]
3526623 3527958 What if I did?
3533162 3534163 Did what?
3535097 3536999 What if I wound up<br />just like you?
3542503 3543738 And here we are.
3548408 3549743 Yeah, here we are.
3590779 3593648 All right...<br />Gelfuso, you're up.
3593715 3597018 [Gelfuso] Okay. Scene was<br />definitely staged.
3597084 3599954 Ballistics says<br />all three victims<br />killed with the same gun.
3600021 3602690 Uh, didn't see that coming.<br />That's a fun one.
3602757 3604125 -They find the gun?<br />-[Gelfuso] Yeah.
3604191 3606659 It was the one<br />in shower guy's hand.
3606726 3608294 Five shots total.
3608361 3611364 Only prints on the gun belong<br />to the dead Spaniard.
3611865 3614266 Anybody holding out<br />for a triple murder-suicide?
3614333 3615734 That would be a neat trick.
3615801 3617269 Specially the part<br />where he reaches out
3617336 3619271 and turns off the shower<br />after he's already dead.
3619338 3620906 -[Gelfuso] Nice catch.<br />-[detective] Thank you.
3623174 3624976 What else?
3625043 3626844 [Gelfuso] I scoured<br />every surveillance camera<br />in the area.
3626911 3628880 I can't put anyone<br />in the house with Muncie.
3628946 3630881 Least of all is<br />John Knox's character.
3630947 3632916 We know Knox's movements?
3632983 3635352 [Gelfuso] He hasn't used<br />his credit card<br />since the murder.
3635420 3639889 Two days before them, he flies<br />from Burbank to San Francisco<br />for 22 hours.
3639955 3641223 Why?
3641290 3643192 [Gelfuso] That part,<br />I haven't figured out yet.
3643259 3644960 But I got him<br />on the return flight<br />then he goes dark.
3645027 3647929 I think it's time we had a chat<br />with John Knox.
3647996 3650265 Go pick him up,<br />but bring him in voluntarily.
3650331 3652267 We got nothing<br />to hold him as a suspect.
3652333 3653701 All right.
3813942 3816711 Do you know what electives<br />you're gonna take this year?
3817513 3819447 Did you get your syllabus?
3819514 3822517 Yeah, I actually ended up<br />getting a class with Michelles.
3822584 3823884 Mhm!
3826520 3828254 [customer] I got<br />a pick-up order for Anthony.
3837530 3840065 I-I just think that it might be<br />too much this year.
3840131 3842133 -[customer] Thanks.<br />-Very good.
3842200 3843801 I'm still gonna do soccer.<br />I think...
3843867 3845736 -Hey, excuse me.<br />-[customer] Yeah.
3845803 3847171 -I saw you<br />looking at my daughter.<br />-[customer] Do I know you?
3847238 3849006 -No.<br />-[woman] Hey! Oh, my God!
3849073 3850508 -[Miles] Fuck you!<br />-[muffled yelling]
3857847 3859915 [knocking]
3865854 3867456 John Knox?
3867522 3869323 Johnny Law.
3869391 3872427 We got something going on<br />we'd like to get<br />your help with.
3872494 3875396 If you could come with us.<br />Voluntarily.
3875463 3876564 [Knox] Sure.
3876631 3878064 Why not? It's my day off.
3878131 3880166 I'll grab a jacket<br />and I'll follow you down.
3880233 3882369 Or we could<br />follow you down.
3883637 3884870 Better.<br />[clicks tongue]
3884937 3886473 [chuckles]
3889643 3893412 She's on my policy. I told you,<br />and I told the last person.
3894680 3896515 It was pre-approved.
3896582 3898149 Her doctor faxed it in.
3898216 3900652 You know, we go<br />through the same fuck...
3900718 3902720 damn thing every month.
3902786 3904522 D-don't put me on hold.
3907990 3909358 [knocking]
3910226 3912396 We got Knox set up<br />in Interview Two.
3915131 3917032 Anything on the other case?<br />Homer?
3917098 3920536 Ah... the prints we found<br />don't match<br />anything on the system.
3920603 3923104 The ME confirmed<br />that there were two blood types<br />on the scene,
3923171 3927241 but hadn't had time to run<br />DNA sequencing to look<br />for a match on the second guy.
3932146 3933813 It's always "guys" with you.
3935248 3937685 -Eh?<br />-You said "the second guy."
3937751 3941754 You also said the gate card<br />was grabbed from behind<br />by "the guy,"
3941820 3943489 even though he never saw<br />his attacker.
3943556 3945157 It's always "guys" with you.
3945223 3948226 Fine. The ME has not had time<br />to run DNA sequencing
3948293 3951095 to look for a match<br />on the second<br />them, they or their.
3951162 3953498 -Is that better?<br />-Welcome to the 21st century.
3953565 3955132 [whispering] Oh, my God.
3966108 3968277 Detective. How can I help you?
3969111 3971080 Save it for the tape.
3972549 3977919 Detective Emily Ikari,<br />interviewing potential<br />material witness, John Knox.
3977985 3981089 Case number 52698.
3981955 3986059 Interview is voluntary.<br />Commencing at 10:46 a.m.
3986893 3989162 Ah... please state your name<br />for the record.
3989763 3990963 John Knox.
3991030 3993199 Ah, full legal.<br />Need the middle name.
4001272 4002475 It's not a trick question.
4002541 4004510 -[chuckles]<br />-Those come later.
4005411 4006644 John Henry Knox.
4010180 4013183 Okay. I don't know<br />what game this is,<br />but let's move on.
4015118 4018087 You said something about...
4018154 4019623 me being a witness?
4019690 4023158 I hope so. I'm working<br />on the death of your partner.
4023225 4025026 -I don't have a partner.<br />-Not anymore.
4026027 4029264 If you're referring<br />to Thomas Muncie,<br />he was an acquaintance.
4029331 4031098 We never did any work together.
4031165 4034436 I've been over the crime scene<br />a dozen times. Ah...
4034503 4036237 let me tell you<br />what I think happened.
4036303 4037338 Sure.
4038038 4040574 There were three dead bodies<br />in that room,
4040641 4041975 all shot with the same gun,
4042041 4044277 and staged to look<br />like they killed each other.
4045178 4047079 But... it was clumsy.
4047814 4050983 Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.
4051049 4053787 I think someone<br />killed Muncie by mistake
4054687 4056954 and tried to stage it<br />to cover it up.
4060191 4063027 Did you say Ikari?
4063094 4065929 Are you related<br />to Peter Ikari?
4068131 4070368 -That's my father.<br />-[Knox] Oh, hell.
4071401 4072803 I know Pete.
4072869 4074504 Get him in here.<br />I'll talk to him.
4074571 4075971 You know my father?
4076706 4079875 I just talked to him...<br />couple days ago.
4079941 4082010 He used to patrol<br />my neighborhood.
4083044 4084979 Mr. Knox, my father is dead.
4086715 4087948 What?
4090518 4091853 What happened?
4091920 4093755 He was shot<br />in the line of duty.
4093822 4095122 Twelve years ago.
4097458 4099325 Where are you going<br />with all this?
4106097 4107433 [sighs]
4107500 4108534 Look.
4110403 4112737 As far<br />as the Muncie murder goes,
4112804 4114406 I wasn't there.
4114473 4117308 And if you had anything<br />to suggest that I was,
4117375 4120644 I'd be doing this interview<br />in a jumpsuit right now.
4120711 4122713 So, as far as you're concerned,
4123447 4125549 I'm Schrodinger's murderer.
4125616 4126650 Schro-what now?
4127685 4128718 At this moment...
4131387 4135892 I both did<br />and did not kill Muncie.
4135959 4137960 And with that,<br />I'm gonna get going.
4138025 4139595 What's your hurry?
4140863 4143164 I'm gonna be going away soon.
4144031 4146934 And before I do,<br />there are some things...
4147000 4148235 I better put right.
4148301 4151439 Interview suspended<br />10:52 a.m.
4154240 4155976 What in the fuck was that?
4156041 4157142 I don't know.
4157209 4159078 Strange fucking tactics.
4159144 4160547 So what's our next move?
4160614 4162113 Not sure.
4162180 4164750 How about we catch<br />our other killer<br />while I mull it over?
4181732 4182766 "Walker."
4184768 4186469 Walker. John Walker.
4189070 4190305 Damnit.
4212759 4214192 [knocking]
4218031 4219263 [knocking]
4274780 4275814 Miles?
4307709 4308909 John?
4312079 4313381 What's with the chrome?
4313447 4314982 What? Are you gonna shoot me?
4315549 4317617 The hell are you doing<br />in my kitchen?
4318385 4320086 Can't believe the key<br />is in the same spot.
4320152 4323123 -Let me get those groceries.<br />-No, no, no, no, no. No.
4323188 4324923 Don't touch the groceries.
4326157 4327893 What are you doing here?
4332064 4333296 I'm here.
4344007 4345241 Hey, I'm...
4347878 4348912 cashing out.
4349945 4353349 So there's gonna be...<br />gonna be some money<br />coming your way.
4353416 4357353 [groans]<br />I don't want your money.
4357420 4361322 Let's... let's skip the part<br />where you pretend<br />you don't and...
4361389 4363558 I pretend to talk you into it.
4368796 4369830 [sighs]
4378171 4379639 Why are you cashing out?
4381874 4382908 Going away.
4385110 4386411 Of course you are.
4389581 4391649 I meant what I said<br />about the money.
4391716 4393784 I never wanted<br />anything from you...
4395052 4396387 except for you.
4398555 4401290 But I guess we both knew<br />that was too much to ask.
4411734 4412768 Yeah.
4417171 4419272 So, anyway. Uhm...
4420708 4424377 I need you to make sure<br />Miles takes his share.
4424444 4426646 That's...<br />[chuckles]
4428181 4429416 That's harder.
4430383 4431617 [clears her throat]
4433953 4435488 Miles is harder.
4435554 4438991 Yeah. And have him...
4440492 4442060 So he can put...
4442127 4443661 ah... the girl...
4444462 4445697 She can go...
4446397 4447664 Go to the, uh...
4449700 4450734 You know.
4451769 4452703 [sighs]
4452770 4453804 Goddammit.
4455139 4456372 The big school.
4457607 4459375 -College.<br />-[Knox] Yeah.
4459442 4461244 Yeah, uh...
4461310 4463212 Yeah.
4463278 4467281 I mean, you know,<br />something good has to come out<br />of all this.
4467349 4469251 How long you going away for?
4469951 4471920 There's no coming back<br />from this one.
4478692 4481194 They finally caught up<br />to you, uh?
4481261 4483295 You must be slipping.
4484697 4486099 Yeah.
4486166 4487467 [snorts]
4487534 4488867 Yeah, you could say that.
4503181 4504782 So, anyway...
4506416 4507951 yeah.
4508018 4509319 Okay.
4511087 4512322 All right.
4517793 4519195 [exhales]
4519261 4520563 Knox...
4521830 4525667 I still love you.<br />Just a little.
4525733 4528603 As much as I hate you,<br />I wouldn't want to shoot you,<br />so...
4530237 4531705 call ahead next time.
4533373 4534608 [Knox] Yeah.
4535742 4537543 There isn't gonna be<br />a next time.
4584051 4586520 [Ruby distorted] <i>You must be</i><br /><i>slipping.</i>
4594760 4598163 [distorted] <i>But I guess</i><br /><i>we both know</i><br /><i>that was too much to ask.</i>
4605003 4606638 [Annie muffled] Knox.
4606704 4607939 [mumbling] Fucking...
4608006 4609073 [muffled] John?
4609140 4611642 Sorry. Am I early?
4619016 4620317 No, uh...
4621351 4624253 I was just gonna...<br />why don't I<br />jump in the shower?
4624321 4628123 Let's have a drink first.<br />I'll make you one for once.
4632894 4636196 I wasn't sure<br />you'd want me here<br />after last time.
4636263 4637965 Why? What happened last time?
4641669 4643970 You got me worried, Knox.
4644037 4645104 Jesus, Ruby!
4645171 4646806 Don't worry about it.
4646873 4650109 I just gotta get a handle<br />on this last part<br />of this thing.
4650176 4652378 How is the cash out coming?
4652444 4656349 I got the paintings<br />and I got the cash, I just have<br />to get the stones here tonight.
4656416 4657582 The stones?
4657649 4659685 Yeah, the stones.
4659751 4663288 And then I gotta take them<br />to my guy. He turns everything<br />into clean cash.
4663788 4665756 Then I just have to...
4665823 4667525 cut it into thirds.
4667591 4668658 [Annie] Why thirds?
4669393 4672228 Only got three people<br />on the list.<br />You're on the list.
4675832 4678033 I don't even<br />look like her, Knox.
4687008 4689243 Here's<br />to every Thursday afternoon.
4714199 4715567 You just get a hand job?
4717168 4718602 Better.
4718669 4721138 You're not gonna believe<br />what Tech just found.
4721205 4722940 -So tell me.<br />-No!
4723007 4726042 No. You gotta hear this<br />for yourself. Come on!
4726109 4728077 [Heather] <i>Okay,</i>
4728144 4730280 everything we thought we'd find<br />based on his previous<br />arrest record.
4730347 4732181 Oh, God.
4732248 4734283 [Heather] But where<br />it gets interesting<br />is in his live chats.
4734350 4736685 He was communicating<br />with half a dozen<br />young teen girls.
4736752 4738754 Convincing them<br />to send nudes.
4738820 4741023 When we get the guy<br />who killed this asshole,<br />we should give him a medal.
4741089 4742790 First we let him loose<br />on a few other guys<br />I can think of.
4742857 4744625 It's always guys with you.
4744692 4746927 [Heather] There's<br />one girl he talked to<br />for over a year,
4746994 4749196 but then they actually started<br />to meet up IRL.
4749263 4751131 IRL?
4751197 4752665 [Heather] In real life.
4752732 4755168 So say that.
4755235 4757771 [Heather] They definitely<br />had sex.
4757837 4759938 A lot of sex.<br />They talked about it.
4760005 4761307 Extensively.
4761374 4762775 Anybody got a Tums?
4765278 4767879 Anyway, I was able to trace<br />her IP address.
4767945 4772850 She's a 16-year-old girl<br />in Silver Lake by the name<br />of Kaylee Iris Knox.
4772917 4774085 Okay.
4774152 4776186 Let's talk<br />to her and her parents.
4777254 4778489 Wait.
4778555 4779656 You said "Knox"?
4779723 4781492 I ran the family.
4782159 4784660 It's John Knox's<br />granddaughter.
4821226 4822861 [glass crashing]
4892989 4896192 I'm sorry. Why do you want<br />to talk to our daughter?
4896260 4899227 Ah... we just have<br />a few questions for Kaylee.
4899295 4901863 And for your husband.<br />You guys are gonna be<br />right in here.
4903932 4907369 Oh, Mr. Knox.<br />Actually, we're gonna put you<br />in this room right over here.
4907435 4908802 [chuckles]
4908869 4910137 Hang on a second.
4912106 4914774 Just be honest, okay?<br />Tell the truth.
4919212 4922247 Detective Ikari is gonna be<br />right with you.
4929955 4931189 [door closing]
4952642 4954109 [distorted sound]
4955977 4957712 [distorted sound]
5001485 5003487 [Miles, distorted]<br /><i>Like, what if I did?</i>
5013127 5015229 [pants]
5025005 5028907 [Ikari] Detective Emily Ikari,<br />interviewing Miles Knox.<br />It is...
5029775 5031411 4:37 p.m.
5033779 5035114 Andrew Palmer.
5037249 5038684 What?
5038751 5040885 Pretty sure you know who he is.
5040952 5043021 I thought this was<br />about the fight at the café.
5043087 5045390 What fight at what café?
5049427 5050461 Okay...
5051895 5053229 What about that prick?
5053297 5055499 We know<br />what happened between you.
5055565 5056866 You called them?
5056932 5058167 You said<br />you wouldn't call them.
5058235 5060304 -No, we didn't.<br />-No. You promised
5060370 5062438 -if I went to the clinic,<br />you wouldn't tell on him.<br />-Honey...
5062505 5063639 Kaylee, Kaylee.
5063706 5065106 Your parents didn't call us.
5065173 5066676 Neither your mom or your dad.
5066742 5068644 What's this about, then?<br />What do you want to know?
5068711 5071646 We found chats on his computer<br />between him and your daughter.
5071713 5074982 We're pretty sure<br />you know what's going on.
5075049 5076917 We know that he raped you.
5077685 5078686 [angry snort]
5078752 5081054 H-he... he didn't rape me.
5083657 5085124 Did you arrest him?
5085191 5088461 No. He... he's not<br />in any trouble with the law.
5088528 5090862 Well, if you're asking me<br />if I want to press charges,<br />I don't wanna--
5090929 5092498 [Ikari] It's too late for that.
5092565 5093599 He's dead.
5097669 5098704 Good.
5099538 5101540 Was it an accident?<br />'Cause I hope he suffered.
5102205 5103840 I wanna show you something.
5106811 5107844 [Ikari clears her throat]
5107911 5109280 See that there?
5109347 5110879 That's your car.
5110946 5114183 Driving into<br />the gated neighborhood<br />where Palmer lives.
5114250 5116185 This is about 20 minutes later.
5117219 5119621 See by the timestamp. See?
5119688 5121390 That's you, no doubt.
5121457 5122491 Yeah, that's me.
5123292 5125193 Yeah, I went to see him.<br />So what?
5125260 5128296 So, somewhere<br />in this time frame,
5128363 5130398 Palmer was stabbed to death<br />in his kitchen.
5130465 5132899 Wow. You can<br />narrow the time of death<br />to 20 minutes?
5132966 5134801 Modern science.
5134867 5137036 This is the part<br />where you tell me<br />you just went to warn him
5137103 5138605 to stay away<br />from your daughter?
5138672 5140072 Yeah, it's exactly right.
5140139 5141775 And I might have punched him.
5141842 5142941 [Ikari] Mhm...
5143409 5145478 How did you cut<br />your hand there?
5145544 5146945 On a glass.
5147011 5148614 We're gonna find<br />that glass in your house?
5148681 5150148 No, I was at...
5150215 5152216 What do you mean at my house?
5152283 5156987 Based on this video,<br />we obtained a warrant<br />for your house and your car.
5157054 5158456 They're being searched now.
5161458 5163460 I'm not gonna say another word<br />until my attorney gets here.
5163527 5165895 And that goes<br />for my underaged daughter.
5165962 5168664 Stop talking to her. Right now.
5168731 5169998 [sighs]
5179907 5181309 [muffled] You all right?
5184077 5185413 Hey, man. Are you okay?
5190718 5191851 Yeah.
5191917 5193820 [Ikari] <i>We got you.</i>
5193887 5194920 Do you, now?
5194987 5196589 Don't say anything.
5196656 5197690 [Ikari] Sure.
5197757 5199793 I'll do the talking.
5199859 5201660 Show you what we found?
5206164 5210401 Your bloody clothes found<br />in a dumpster<br />behind your apartment.
5210468 5212068 What? Bullshit.
5212135 5213838 The murder weapon...
5213905 5216939 hidden in a heating vent<br />in your apartment.
5217006 5218375 No, no.<br />Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5218442 5220911 -That's not right.<br />-Miles, stop talking.
5220976 5223447 The knife has prints<br />all over it.
5223513 5226114 We'll be pulling yours<br />for comparison<br />in about five minutes.
5226181 5229618 Me? I'm confident.
5229685 5233321 Long, blonde hair recovered<br />from the lapel of your coat.
5233388 5235723 Would you wanna bet<br />it matches the victim?
5235790 5237659 Don't speak.
5237725 5241961 Miles Knox, I'm arresting you<br />for the murder<br />of Andrew Palmer.
5242028 5243864 You have the right<br />to remain silent.
5243931 5247200 Anything you say<br />can be held against you<br />in a court of law.
5247768 5250168 [Philo] Here, a little coin<br />for your trouble.
5250236 5252572 [man] I'm good. I'm glad<br />you guys showed up.
5252638 5253639 Take care of him.
5253706 5254973 [Philo] Thank you.
5257275 5260110 All kinds of people<br />make this world, don't they?
5264616 5266015 Okay, pal.
5267183 5269185 How are you even here?
5269253 5271988 I'm the last person<br />you called, see?
5272055 5274824 Give Ludmilla your keys.<br />She'll drive your Caddy back.
5274891 5276759 I can drive my own car.
5276826 5279995 [Ludmilla] It's right<br />around the corner.<br />50 meters away. Come.
5282664 5284466 [Gelfuso] Hey,<br />congrats on the arrest.
5284533 5285901 Thanks.
5285968 5287402 I found out<br />why Knox went<br />to San Francisco.
5287469 5289605 He was there<br />to see a doctor.
5289671 5291706 !Ah... Doctor...
5291772 5293307 Frederick Burns.
5294275 5295810 [Ikari] The neurologist?
5295877 5296878 How do you know that?
5298177 5300480 [Gelfuso] Obviously,<br />I couldn't get<br />any medical records,
5300547 5303115 but the guy specializes<br />in treating dementia.
5304751 5306485 Okay. Good work.
5306552 5307653 Thank you.
5310289 5312725 Did you at least<br />get what you came for?
5315058 5317328 Yeah... yeah.
5324434 5326203 Xavier...
5326270 5327804 I can only remember about...
5328839 5331507 Three hours of today.
5331574 5333809 It's like a curtain<br />coming down.
5337747 5339247 That's rough.
5341783 5342817 Why me?
5344019 5345554 I mean, you know.
5345620 5348989 Trained killer, Army,<br />and all that, I know, but...
5349055 5350558 Why'd you pull me in?
5353727 5357095 That brain of yours.
5357162 5360500 I knew you'd understand<br />the training<br />I was putting you through.
5362134 5363569 You know, in all this time...
5363635 5364836 [Philo] Mhm?
5364903 5367606 Never left a print behind,<br />no DNA, nothing.
5367673 5369775 [Philo] Mmm...
5369841 5372142 I learned from the master.
5372209 5373744 What's your count, anyway?
5373811 5375413 [Knox] Two.
5375479 5376581 Two?
5378081 5379216 Come on.
5379283 5381384 The cabbie in Chicago and...
5382319 5384119 a woman in the shower.
5387424 5389725 Two civilians. Fuck.
5391192 5392428 You know...
5393228 5395531 Muncie...
5395598 5399367 he liked to talk<br />about the targets, you know.
5399434 5401436 Pimps, drug dealers,<br />traffickers.
5402570 5403605 Yeah.
5404471 5406206 I think it made him<br />feel better.
5407507 5409810 He never got what it was...
5409876 5411345 really all about.
5412612 5413479 Which was?
5413546 5416582 Guys caught behind enemy lines.
5416649 5417750 That's all.
5421853 5423455 So...
5423521 5426591 We only have<br />two steps left.
5426658 5428226 [sighs]
5428293 5431328 Your visit and my call.
5431395 5432863 Visit and a call.
5434398 5436867 Visit and the call,<br />visit and the call.
5436934 5438166 I can do that.
5438234 5440336 Keep the notes<br />in your pocket.
5441371 5444540 I'll remind you when to go.
5446074 5447275 You'll be done
5447342 5448577 tomorrow.
5453215 5454949 I'm scared.
5455016 5456584 Yeah
5456651 5457718 I figured.
5473966 5475367 Hey...
5475434 5478202 I need you to do<br />one more thing for me.
5478269 5479971 Finish my cash out.
5480038 5482040 Take my stuff to Philo.
5482106 5484809 You wanna put me<br />in charge of your money?
5484876 5486243 You know I'm a thief.
5486309 5487911 You're not gonna steal from me.
5487978 5489713 No...
5489780 5491048 Probably not.
5491114 5493216 Wait here.<br />I'll bring it out.
5493283 5494750 Okay, yeah.
5507195 5508663 [door opening]
5560341 5561576 [chuckles]
5568281 5570417 I'm sorry, Knox.
5570484 5571718 It's a lot of money.
5575155 5576455 Can't argue with that.
5580359 5582628 -Now what?<br />-Get the stones.
5582695 5583729 Ah...
5586064 5587766 Easy, easy, easy.
5590401 5591636 [speaks foreign language]
5606616 5608151 [man] Where you going, huh?
5608218 5609951 Eh?<br />[groans]
5611653 5615390 [groans]
5615457 5617792 [groans and coughs]
5632273 5633505 [gunshots]
5637776 5638777 [gunshots]
5638844 5641313 [sobs]
5653224 5654457 Knox...
5658060 5660396 How were you gonna<br />split the take?
5661430 5662898 Four equal shares.
5663799 5664834 [snorts]
5665935 5667203 That's funny?
5667269 5668636 [Knox] Yeah, it is.
5671173 5672674 You were gonna get a third.
5673942 5674975 [Annie] What?
5676410 5678078 You were one of the three.
5679446 5681216 You're thinking<br />of your ex-wife.
5681282 5682748 [Knox] No, Annie.
5682815 5683850 It was you.
5686052 5689755 My Thursday afternoon date<br />for the last four years.
5691190 5694092 My ex-wife,<br />my son...
5695060 5696094 and you.
5698164 5699530 All you had to do...
5701199 5702433 was nothing.
5713643 5715978 [currency-counting machine]
5716044 5717880 He wants to make<br />a change to the list.
5717946 5720316 Take off the last name,<br />the hooker.
5720382 5722352 No problemo.
5722417 5725686 You split it even, fifty-fifty,<br />between the wife and the son.
5725753 5727822 Carve out something for you?
5727889 5729423 No, I'm good.
5729490 5731892 [currency-counting machine]
5751310 5752877 What the hell, Dad?
5752944 5754746 I don't understand<br />why you'd--
5754812 5757215 -Wait, wait, wait. Stop.<br />-[Miles] I don't understand...
5757282 5758916 Stop. Just listen to me.
5758982 5760584 I'm so confused.
5760651 5761785 I went to you for help.
5761852 5764453 Why? Why would you<br />do this to me?
5765454 5767957 You're the reason<br />I went to prison.
5769892 5770760 I'm what?
5770826 5772296 [Knox] The tax evasion thing.
5772727 5775231 You're the one<br />who ratted me out.
5775298 5777366 What the hell? I didn't know<br />anything about you back then.
5777432 5780701 I did six years<br />because of you.
5780768 5783338 No, no. That's not true.
5783405 5786174 That's not true, Dad.<br />Listen to me.<br />I think you're losing it.
5786241 5789609 Something's wrong with you.<br />Why would... Why would you<br />think I would do that?
5789676 5790910 Look at me.
5792478 5793713 It was you.
5795782 5797350 You turned me in.
5797417 5799618 I did not!<br />I didn't do it, Dad!
5799685 5802688 That's not true!<br />Dad, listen to me!<br />Listen to me!
5802754 5804990 [muffled] Dad! Goddammit!
5805057 5806023 Listen to me!
5806090 5808893 Why would I do that<br />even if I knew!
5808960 5809994 You're wrong!
5818535 5819970 -Hey, Ikari.<br />-What?
5820036 5821737 There's a problem<br />with the Palmer evidence.
5821804 5823239 -Which evidence?<br />-All of it.
5824673 5827743 It's a first.<br />There is a problem<br />with the blood on the clothes.
5827810 5829412 Evidence of Erythromycin.
5829478 5832448 That's a molecular breakdown<br />consistent with freezing.
5832513 5836918 The blood on the clothes was<br />frozen for at least 12 hours
5836985 5839486 before it was thawed<br />and put on the fabric.
5840188 5841488 Put?
5841555 5842923 Yeah. Same with the knife.
5842990 5844791 Wait... that's not<br />the murder weapon?
5844858 5847059 No, it definitely is,<br />and the blood is the victim's.
5847126 5849162 The issue is<br />with the fingerprints.
5849229 5850596 No. I saw the comparison.
5850663 5852598 They matched<br />Miles Knox's prints,<br />no question.
5852665 5855000 Yes, but they contained<br />traces of monomers.
5855066 5857370 Butyl acrylate<br />and methyl methacrylate.
5857436 5858471 Packing tape.
5859004 5861240 Also, some sort<br />of household spice.
5861307 5864541 I'm sorry, detective.<br />The prints on the knife<br />were planted.
5864608 5865909 Planted?
5866677 5870148 -Christ...<br />-And then, there's the hair<br />from the coat.
5870215 5872682 It's really impossible<br />that this was<br />the only thing we found.
5872749 5874684 I've been over this<br />three times.
5874751 5879288 In my opinion, this jacket<br />was never anywhere<br />near the crime scene.
5879355 5880856 But we have the video.
5880922 5883992 [Heather] Yeah...<br />about that...
5884059 5885093 Fuck me!
5889663 5893000 [phone vibrating]
5893067 5894302 Hey.
5894369 5896370 You're almost home.
5896437 5897971 One more step.
5898038 5899039 Okay.
5899973 5902376 [Philo] <i>I'm gonna</i><br /><i>make the call.</i>
5902443 5903976 You just sit tight.
5904043 5906612 Oh, did you get rid<br />of the notebook?
5906678 5907746 Yeah, I did.
5907813 5909548 Because this all goes to hell
5909615 5910949 if they find the notebook.
5911016 5912683 You understand?
5912750 5915086 -It's gone.<br />-[Philo] <i>What did you do</i><br /><i>with it?</i>
5915154 5916155 I burned it.
5916221 5917489 Okay.
5917922 5920123 I'll make the call<br />and it's over.
5920191 5922125 Yeah, good.
5922193 5924162 Hey, eh... X.
5925229 5926797 You should...
5926863 5930066 probably tell her I got<br />three dead bodies over here.
5930133 5933270 Do you have...<br />three dead bodies in there?
5933336 5934603 [Knox] <i>I do.</i>
5934670 5936037 -Three?<br /><i>-</i> [Knox] <i>Three.</i>
5939107 5940476 Oh, John.
5940543 5941776 Yeah.
5942411 5943645 Listen...
5947681 5948916 Good luck.
5952553 5955355 [Heather] It's<br />almost imperceptible<br />to the naked eye,
5955422 5957090 but there's a jump there.
5957157 5959359 And if you go<br />into the root file,
5959426 5962694 someone clearly deleted<br />the original timestamp<br />and wrote over it.
5962761 5964564 Hard to spot, but it's there.
5964629 5965630 Meaning what?
5966598 5969633 He could have driven<br />in-and-out of the gate<br />on any day, at any time.
5969700 5971969 The footage was<br />simply spliced in.
5977308 5978875 Miles Knox was framed?
5978942 5980244 It's what it looks like.
5980311 5983214 It doesn't add up.<br />Nothing makes sense.
5983280 5984647 Detective Ikari.
5984714 5986048 -Not now.<br />-There's a phone call for you.
5986115 5988117 -I said not now!<br />-[officer] Okay, but...
5988184 5990819 This guy says<br />it has something to do<br />with John Knox.
5991887 5993654 This is detective Ikari.
5993721 5995790 <i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>
5995857 5997892 You should get up<br />to his bungalow
5997959 5999861 Why the hell<br />would I do that?
5999927 6002497 [Philo] <i>He's got</i><br /><i>three dead bodies in there.</i>
6002563 6004565 [Ikari] <i>Who is this?</i>
6004631 6007067 An anonymous,<br />concerned citizen.
6018977 6020678 Don't move! Do not move!
6022046 6023681 [officer, muffled] God bodies.
6023748 6025884 [echoing] What happened?
6026817 6028286 Jesus, Knox.
6028353 6029786 -Put your hands<br />behind your back.<br />-All right.
6034525 6035758 [officer] Let's go.
6039229 6040763 Hey, hey! Ikari!
6040830 6042199 You're gonna want<br />to check this out.
6053308 6054808 Why would he...?
6054875 6056110 What the hell is this?
6056810 6058045 What?
6063150 6064185 [sighs]
6064251 6065718 Jesus Christ.
6067753 6068921 It was him.
6070123 6071823 [woman] My client won't be<br />making any statements.
6071890 6073992 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'll do the talking again.
6074394 6075826 You can wait outside.
6077895 6079431 So, Miles.
6080932 6083168 We know you didn't kill<br />Andrew Palmer.
6084402 6086736 -What?<br />-[Ikari] You're in the clear.
6086870 6089973 We're dropping all the charges.<br />You'll walk out of here<br />in half an hour a free man.
6090040 6093310 But first, tell me again<br />how you cut your hand.
6094944 6096179 On a broken glass.
6096912 6098381 [Ikari] Where?
6098448 6099881 At my father's house.
6099948 6101383 Why were you there?
6101450 6102850 [Lawyer] Don't say anything.
6110625 6113261 At least...<br />tell me about your dad.
6113328 6114761 In general terms.
6114828 6116062 -[Lawyer] Don't.<br />-Wait.
6119700 6121067 In general terms?
6123803 6125304 A lousy jerk.
6125371 6127038 And a hothead?
6127106 6129108 [Miles] Yeah, that's right.<br />He's abusive.
6129175 6131843 He's a despicable human being.
6131910 6133311 [Ikari] See, I get that.
6133378 6135513 But how big a prick<br />do you need to be...
6136947 6138983 to frame your own son<br />for murder?
6142919 6144421 I don't follow.
6144488 6145989 I got all the evidence.
6146055 6148691 Everything he used to frame you<br />was in his house.
6148757 6151427 He planted your prints<br />on the murder weapon,
6151494 6152928 hid it in your wall,
6152995 6154763 put the victim's blood<br />on your clothes,
6154830 6156733 his hair on your clothes.
6156798 6159867 Put your blood<br />from that broken glass<br />at the murder scene.
6159934 6161303 Why would he do that?
6162504 6164239 Why does he hate you so much?
6172078 6173413 'Cause I turned him in.
6174813 6176216 What do you mean?
6176283 6177651 [Miles] The tax case<br />he went to prison for.
6178184 6179952 I was the one<br />who called the IRS.
6180019 6182454 [Ikari] Mhm... no.<br />The file says that was<br />someone named--
6182521 6183555 File's wrong.
6184856 6186090 It was me.
6203473 6205642 [cell opening]
6205709 6207942 We never could tie<br />that gun to you.
6208009 6209911 Looks like you got away<br />with that one.
6211946 6213516 But just between us...
6215383 6216418 tell me.
6217752 6219554 It was you who shot Muncie,<br />wasn't it?
6228629 6229929 Muncie coming?
6230896 6232198 Muncie is dead.
6232898 6234367 You killed him.
6238036 6239304 They have newspapers here.
6239371 6241173 Muncie likes<br />to read the newspaper.
6251415 6252550 [phone rattling]
6255084 6256919 [guard] 0-5-2-3!
6256985 6258488 [buzzing]
6260657 6261957 Sorry.
6264593 6265860 He's not doing well.
6267929 6269531 Why do you wanna see him?
6269598 6271266 He tried to frame you.
6271332 6272533 Yeah, I mean...
6272600 6275136 He still killed the man<br />who raped my daughter.
6275203 6277638 And that's okay<br />with you? Murder?
6277705 6280507 If I could, I'd dig Palmer up<br />and I'd kill him again.
6282609 6286279 By the way, they're<br />moving him<br />to a medical facility tomorrow.
6286346 6288314 I tried to get<br />a move sooner, but...
6289348 6290483 bureaucracy.
6292718 6294320 He went so fast,<br />didn't he?
6295521 6297020 Fortunately for you.
6298021 6299257 How do you mean?
6299324 6301259 If he hadn't been<br />losing his mind,
6301326 6303528 he might have gotten away<br />with framing you.
6303595 6304894 Lucky for me, then.
6307531 6308565 Yeah.
6315003 6316372 [buzzing]
6335423 6337055 Hey, Dad.
6337123 6338358 Is it Sunday?
6339826 6342562 No, no. It's not.
6342629 6344062 It's Wednesday, Dad.
6344996 6346665 -Why?<br />-Well...
6349000 6350469 My son likes football.
6353171 6354305 Is that so?
6354372 6355406 [Knox] Yeah.
6357608 6360077 Sometimes we go<br />to the Rose Bowl.
6364781 6366316 I bet he loves that.
6366383 6368118 -[Knox] Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
6369885 6371120 But...
6373054 6374290 [sobs]
6378326 6380094 [sighs]
6380161 6381429 [Knox muttering] Sunday...
6383997 6385233 I love you, Dad.
6393607 6394640 Yeah.
6453959 6455261 [unintelligible conversation]
6455327 6456595 [Kaylee giggling]
6466471 6469038 -[Miles] Who wants to get beat?<br />-I don't know it.
