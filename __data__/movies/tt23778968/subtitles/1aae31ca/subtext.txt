82584 84335 Yeah, but who needs it?
84419 85920 What's an inbox?
86004 88506 It's where, um, where<br />all your emails are stored.
88590 90091 It's like a big folder
90174 92302 on your computer<br />with all of the emails.
95054 96556 <i>What's a computer?</i>
97807 100476 This is a computer.
100560 103187 I know this is a computer,<br />but what is it really?
103271 104522 How does it function?
104606 106691 <i>It's, um...</i>
107275 108359 Let's come back to that.

152403 154906 No, that's the whole thing.<br />He does it all himself.
156324 158660 - Wow.<br />- That's Cruise.
158743 160411 Terrific.
160995 164624 - You got big plans tonight?<br />- Eh, just dinging around.
166125 168127 You spoken to Allie?
168169 169504 We're still on a break.
169587 172382 I'm just, you know, trying<br />to give her a little space,
172465 174926 and... I'm just not really sure
175009 176320 what my selling points<br />are at the moment.
176344 177428 Oh,
177512 179681 well, you're<br />a wonderful grandson.
179764 182642 You know computers.<br />You have your hair.
182725 184310 I think it's gonna start<br />to go early.
184394 186020 Well, you can't<br />get hung up on that.
186104 189148 Yeah. We're just in different<br />places as people, you know?
189190 190775 She... she thinks I'm stuck.
191984 193736 You're too young to be stuck.
194612 195863 I don't feel young.
196447 198157 Well, I don't feel old.
198199 199992 - Oy.<br />- "Oy" is right.
201953 205873 You're gonna land<br />on your feet. Like Cruise.
207834 210378 Who is it they say<br />lands on their feet?
210461 211461 I think cats.
211504 212755 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
212839 214599 But I guess in a way,<br />it could be about both.
214674 215674 Mm.
215842 217176 Do you want this?
217677 220346 It's a marble.<br />I got a ton of these.
220430 221848 Sure.
221931 224350 How about some pretzels?<br />I got a ton of pretzels.
224434 225703 Only if, yeah,<br />you don't need them.
225727 227395 No, I can't chew them.
227478 229939 What... Could you please<br />just wear this when I go?
230022 231941 - Ugh, I'm fine.<br />- I know you are.
232024 233293 You... you...<br />you probably won't need it,
233317 235157 but I'll just feel better<br />if you wear it, okay?
235194 236487 What's the point?
236571 238406 - If I fall, I'm toast.<br />- Come on.
238489 239907 That's why I don't fall.
239991 241242 Don't say that, please.
242034 244287 For my mental health?
244370 245705 Okay.
246497 248750 - For my guardian angel.<br />- Thank you.

532992 534368 <i>So, I don't know.</i>
534452 536829 This one has been good<br />every time I've gone to them.

540207 541667 70 miles from the ocean.
541751 542751 But I don't know...
566400 568944 <i>Gail, something has happened.</i>
570905 573074 Mom, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br />Slow down.
573157 575701 - Who did you talk to?<br />- Daniel.
575785 580539 Oh, Gail, he was so upset.<br />He was so upset.
580623 582583 Okay, I'm calling him right now.
587963 589757 <i>Oh, my God. He's not picking up.</i>
589840 591008 Oh, my God.
592093 593719 I'm calling the house line.
600976 602228 Oh, my God.
602311 605022 - Ah, Mom, Alan is calling.<br />- What?
605106 606506 Alan is calling.<br />I'll call you back.
606565 607691 What's going on?
607775 609318 <i>My mother got a call</i>
609401 610670 from Daniel,<br />and apparently he's in jail.
610694 611904 Someone broke his nose.
611987 613364 Who told her that?
613447 614949 <i>She spoke to him.<br />She spoke to Daniel.</i>
615032 616952 And then I tried calling him<br />and I can't get him.
617034 618577 And he's not picking up<br />his phone?
618619 620371 No. I'm gonna try him again.
620454 622289 <i>Okay. I'm getting in the car.</i>
622373 623999 Uh, let me know what you hear.
631507 632507 Hello?
632967 636720 And he was going on and on<br />about how you hit someone,
636804 638514 and it was worse than you think.
638597 642101 - And she was pregnant and...<br />- I hit a pregnant woman?
642184 643328 Like, I struck her with my fist?
643352 644854 Oh, no, no, no,<br />it was a car accident.
644937 646540 No, yeah, this was all happening<br />inside of a car.
646564 648500 Oh. Okay, well, that...<br />Yeah, that makes more sense.
648524 650401 Well, what are you<br />talking about?
650484 652611 No, I misunderstood.
652695 654321 Why weren't you picking up<br />your phone?
654405 655447 I was asleep.
655531 657408 At 10:30? I called you at 10:30.
657491 658742 And then... and then...
658826 660470 Yeah, but I went out<br />last night with some friends.
660494 662746 - You didn't drive, did you?<br />- Um...
662830 665958 Did you get drunk? You know,<br />alcohol is a major depressant.
666041 667793 It's... Wendy Horowitz's son
667877 669187 is completely hooked<br />on Don Julio.
669211 671589 - Don Julio.<br />- He's... He can't hold a job.
671630 672798 He's in and out of rehabs.
672882 675176 He's... Has no sense of agency.
675259 676719 - And he vapes.<br />- He vapes.
676802 679388 He's completely lost,<br />and he may never find himself.
679471 680723 Are you paying attention?
680806 683559 - Yes, I understand.<br />- Do you?
683642 685042 Yeah. I mean,<br />it's... it's an issue.
685644 688647 Mom, did you really think<br />it was Daniel?
688689 690399 I mean, how did you think<br />this was real?
690482 692026 Mom, you thought<br />it was real, too.
692109 693777 Well, she was very convincing.
693861 695181 Well, she was scared,<br />your mother.
695237 696614 - I was so...<br />- We were all scared.
696655 699241 I wasn't quite as scared,<br />just for the record.
699325 701869 We'll see what happens<br />when you get a call, buddy.
701952 705164 I wouldn't be fooled.<br />My mind is sharp as a tack.
705247 706373 What?
706457 707475 I said I wouldn't be fooled.
707499 708834 My mind is sharp as a tack.
709668 711879 - What's he saying?<br />- He's making a joke.
711962 713422 - Oh.<br />- You want to try it again?
713505 714816 - What's the joke, Alan?<br />- Never mind.
714840 716508 - Never mind.<br />- It wasn't a joke.
716592 717927 - Never mind.<br />- Well, you know,
718010 719178 it was a close call, but...
720554 721554 it's over now.
721889 722889 Everything's okay.
724225 725726 I am so embarrassed.
725809 727394 - No.<br />- Don't be. You're home.
727478 729021 You're safe.<br />That's all that matters.
729897 731273 But I sent the money.
733609 734652 Oh.
739865 740950 You're speeding, Danny.
743661 745412 Well, we could report<br />a tracking number
745496 748082 if it's with Western Union,<br />FedEx, UPS.
748165 749833 With a letter,<br />our only real option
749917 751252 is to contact<br />the postal service,
751335 753712 and with these types<br />of things, the odds are slim,
753754 755047 especially without the address.
755130 756715 I think I have it here.
756757 758568 Aw, it's such a mean<br />thing to do. It's just sick.
758592 759861 Isn't there anything<br />that can be done?
759885 761345 A database of some kind.
761428 763305 We have no moral center<br />as a society.
763389 765224 This is a systemic issue.
765724 767518 - You have it?<br />- I don't have it.
768102 769436 If it's any comfort,
769520 771280 these kinds of scams<br />are increasingly common.
771355 773816 Well, how do they know who I am?
773899 776652 They contact people at random<br />using telephone listings
776735 779488 - and social networking sites.<br />- Like Facebook?
779822 780948 Sure. Like Facebook.
781031 784201 Well, how can Zuckemborg<br />let this happen?
784285 785577 Sorry?
785661 788414 Shouldn't Zuckemborg<br />be able to fix this?
789248 790416 Are you on Facebook?
791000 792543 - Am I?<br />- No you're not. She's not.
792626 794211 - Uh, this was a tangent.<br />- No.
794295 796088 I would<br />suggest canceling your cards
796171 797965 and freezing your accounts<br />until you're sure
798048 799276 you didn't provide<br />any information
799300 801844 that can leave the door open<br />to more fraud.
801927 804430 Beyond that, there's not much<br />we can do at this point.
804513 805639 Hmm.
807016 808016 Sorry.
808892 809893 No, you're not.
812187 813564 You want a blanket?
814940 817192 Or, um, water or anything?
817276 820612 No, I'll just close my eyes<br />for a minute.
823907 825492 She gets confused.
825576 827453 - Not really.<br />- It's more than before.
827536 829330 I haven't noticed<br />that big of a difference.
829413 830789 Little things, maybe.
830873 832333 She's gotten these calls before.
832416 834001 We may be entering a new phase.
834084 836253 What? What do you mean...<br />a new phase?
836337 839715 Now may be the time<br />where we really consider
839798 842134 whether or not living alone<br />is the best option.
842217 844577 - You think we're there?<br />We're just... We're considering it.
844803 846472 I lost my wallet last week.
846889 850142 I don't think that was a sign<br />of my mind deteriorating.
850225 851619 No, that's a lack of presence,<br />sweetheart.
851643 853038 Did you order<br />a replacement license?
853062 855081 - Yeah, yeah. I did.<br />- Good 'cause you don't wanna be
855105 856916 driving without that.<br />You could end up in a database.
856940 858233 Why are you obsessed
858317 859419 with databases all of a sudden?
859443 860723 You don't want to end up in one.
860778 862279 Okay, well, I just think that...
863113 864323 this can be handled.
864406 865574 Maybe I can handle it.
865657 866950 What are you proposing?
867034 869328 I will come over more,<br />I'll call every day,
869411 871139 and I'll make sure that<br />she keeps her Lifeline on.
871163 872539 Oh, my God,<br />I didn't tell you this.
872623 874792 Susan's mother fell<br />into a fire pit.
874833 875918 Completely died.
876001 877836 What?<br />Why are we talking about this?
877878 879880 Well, because things happen<br />to people as they age.
879963 881757 Weird, crazy things like that.
881840 883133 - Was it on?<br />- I didn't ask.
883217 884426 I assumed it was.
884510 886303 This wouldn't have<br />happened a year ago.
886387 888180 She's not as self-reliant<br />as she was.
888263 890099 We can't just keep doing<br />what we're doing.
890182 891475 She's 93.
891558 893198 Well, maybe it's time<br />for assisted living.
905114 906573 You sure I can't stay over?
906657 907950 Oh, no. No, no.
908033 909618 - I've got things to do.<br />- Okay.
911870 913455 Yeah.
916667 919795 For my mental health.
936728 938480 Aw, Teddy.
940524 942234 I made a mistake.
1026693 1029488 - Uh, hi.<br />- Hello.
1029571 1031281 Do we know each other?
1031365 1033408 I'm not sure.
1033492 1036036 You... you look so familiar.
1036119 1038247 Do you know Judy? Judy Miller?
1039122 1040832 I don't think so.
1041416 1044044 Do you know Ellen? Ellen Marcus?
1044127 1046046 No, I don't think so.
1047005 1049967 - Well, have a nice day.<br />- Bye, now.
1082249 1083667 Hi.
1083750 1087170 - I... I found the address.<br />- What? What address?
1087254 1088547 <i>From the scam.</i>
1088630 1091133 It was this tiny slip of paper.
1091216 1093176 You'll never guess<br />where I found it.
1093260 1094946 - Grandma, I'm sorry, - it's going...<br /><i>- It was...</i>
1094970 1096281 <i>- in the trash can...</i><br />- in and out.
1096305 1097389 I can't hear you that well.
1097472 1099433 in the bathroom<br />at the post office.
1100058 1102477 Wait, you went<br />to the post office?
1102561 1103604 Yeah.
1103687 1104813 <i>Well, how did you get there?</i>
1104896 1106023 Well, I walked.
1106064 1107441 Grandma.
1107524 1109164 That's far.<br />You should not have done that.
1109234 1111153 Well, it's a few blocks.
1111236 1115032 Y... you can't... You need<br />to tell me if you're gonna...
1116241 1118744 go somewhere,<br />so that I can take you, okay?
1119369 1120746 <i>What?</i>
1120829 1124374 You... you should not have<br />gone that far on your own.
1125000 1127127 But I found it. I have it here.
1127210 1128295 <i>I know.</i>
1128378 1131173 Maybe it's better<br />to just pause for now
1131256 1135052 and we can<br />figure it out together. Okay?
1135636 1136762 What about my money?
1136845 1139056 Am I supposed to just<br />let them have it?
1139097 1140682 Well, but the odds<br />of getting it back
1140766 1142142 are pretty slim, right?
1142225 1143602 I mean, the most important thing
1143685 1146438 is that you don't overdo it,<br />that... that you're safe.
1147272 1148607 <i>I'm sorry about the money,</i>
1149274 1151985 <i>but it... it could<br />have been a lot worse.</i>
1152903 1154821 Are you okay?<br />You're at home now?
1154905 1156198 Yeah, I'm at home.
1156281 1157741 <i>Oh, great.</i>
1157824 1161078 <i>You need to go anywhere,<br />just tell me. I can take you.</i>
1161119 1165123 Okay, darling.<br />Appreciate that. Speak soon.
1165165 1166917 Love you. Oh.
1170545 1174466 Cynthia, I... I'm afraid<br />I need a bit of a favor.
1174549 1177761 Uh, it's an odd situation,<br />and... Uh...
1178470 1181765 Oh, Sarah.<br />I thought you were Cynthia.
1182140 1186478 She did? How awful.<br />Oh, Sarah, I'm so sorry.
1186561 1190482 No, no, no. Never mind.<br />Forget I called. All is well.
1190565 1193360 Hello? Is Harvin there?
1194528 1195654 Well, what happened?
1196321 1199533 Oh, a stroke.<br />Oh, I am so sorry, Joan.
1199616 1201159 A heart attack?
1201243 1202411 Sepsis?
1202494 1204162 He moved to Cleveland?
1204246 1206581 Well, when did this happen?
1206665 1209209 Oh, God, I called Cynthia again.
1209292 1213255 Sarah, it was a mistake.<br />I know she's dead. Thank you.
1237362 1239906 Danny, I need a ride.
1240991 1243326 Just to get this<br />out of the way up top,
1243869 1246538 you were not at home.
1250459 1252210 All my friends are dead.
1252294 1255213 What? Don't say that.
1255297 1257966 Well, it's true.<br />They're all popping off.
1258049 1261136 I used to be<br />in four lunch groups.
1261636 1263388 Who's left? Judith?
1264097 1266975 She can't hear anything,<br />and she's a hunchback now.
1267058 1269936 I... I wouldn't want to have<br />lunch with her alone.
1270020 1273982 Herman's in Canada.<br />Mona doesn't leave the house.
1274065 1276151 I could ask Lee Horner<br />to join us,
1276234 1277778 but I don't have her number.
1277861 1280280 And Ruth burned up<br />in a fire pit.
1280363 1282240 I heard that. I'm sorry.
1284701 1286870 I didn't expect to get so old.
1287829 1288830 Well...
1290123 1291249 I'm glad you did.
1293752 1295170 Who do you know here, again?
1295253 1298465 You remember Ben. Ben Halpern?<br />He was married to Cheryl.
1298548 1299841 Oh, yeah.
1299925 1301968 Yeah, you guys used to see<br />each other all the time.
1302052 1305597 I always found him,<br />I don't know, s... s... soft.
1305680 1308183 - Soft?<br />- I... I don't know. Fussy.
1308266 1309266 Oh.
1310352 1311853 Cheryl's dead, too.
1312646 1315273 She fell down some stairs<br />in their house.
1316316 1319027 She was there for hours<br />before they found her.
1319110 1320153 Poor thing.
1320237 1321279 I remember.
1322280 1324616 This car is filthy.
1324699 1326785 I've taken good care of it.<br />I'm gonna clean it.
1326868 1329454 Oh, you don't clean it.<br />Who raised you?
1329538 1330622 Your daughter.
1330705 1332999 This is your father's influence.
1333083 1335210 There are coins<br />all over the floor.
1335293 1338713 They fall out of his pockets<br />'cause he's got no waist.
1338797 1341800 Every time I ride with him,<br />I make five bucks.
1355188 1358275 - Want me to come in?<br />- Oh, I'm just saying hello.
1358316 1360986 I won't be long. Thirty minutes.
1362070 1363738 If you need anything,<br />I'll be here.
1363822 1365282 Okay.
1433516 1436227 Then you'll go to The Roxy
1436311 1439606 and then an ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's
1439689 1443610 and then a hansom cab ride<br />around Central Park.
1444736 1446947 Gloria, that's your cue.
1447030 1449449 Oh, right. And what do I say?
1449532 1451034 "Golly."
1451117 1455080 All right. Okay.<br />Do you know? Golly.
1455163 1456623 Just "golly." Just the line.
1456706 1457832 I did, didn't I? Yes?
1457916 1459167 Uh, not... not quite.
1459250 1461002 We went through that,<br />and I said...
1461086 1462921 Why don't we<br />go back to hansom cab,
1463004 1464965 and then grab golly?
1465340 1467634 Ah, it is good to see you, Thel.
1468426 1471346 - You look terrific.<br />- Ah, I'm a balloon.
1472681 1474557 Well, what's with this?<br />Are you doing a play?
1474641 1477936 Yes. <i>Annie.</i><br />I got Daddy Warbucks.
1478019 1481439 - Well, that's a big role.<br />- Yeah, I wasn't expecting it.
1481523 1483400 I thought I'd be part<br />of the chorus
1483441 1485193 or maybe Mr. Bundles.
1485276 1487612 We open tonight,<br />but Miss Hannigan...
1488655 1489656 she's senile,
1490448 1492450 and we got a lady<br />playing Roosevelt
1492492 1494327 because there's never<br />enough boys.
1494411 1498289 And Gloria, that's Annie,<br />she's a total amateur.
1498373 1501876 I'm going to have to bring<br />a lot of pizzazz.
1502836 1505046 You know,<br />I think about Teddy often.
1505630 1507090 What a special guy.
1507674 1509926 Uh, how long has it been?<br />Two years now?
1510010 1512679 - Just about two.<br />- Yeah, five for my Cheryl.
1513763 1515682 It feels like a dream.
1517934 1520812 - How are you holding up?<br />- Let's not be maudlin.
1520895 1522480 You going to show me your place?
1522522 1524065 Oh, oh, sure, sure. Come on.
1524649 1526276 Got a TV.
1527610 1529029 Window. Plants.
1529904 1530904 Do you mind?
1532824 1534909 Infection starts from the hands.
1536077 1538288 Director is trying to get me<br />to touch Gloria
1538371 1540081 in that scene where I adopt her,
1540165 1542625 but I'm not going to do it.<br />It's not worth it.
1542709 1544627 If it makes it worse, so be it.
1544711 1546504 It's not like<br />we're being reviewed.
1547589 1551593 Oh, this is Gary.<br />We call him Starey Gary.
1551676 1552886 It's not an insult.
1553261 1554541 It's just something<br />that happens.
1555513 1556765 I don't think he minds.
1557432 1559392 Everybody does it. Not just me.
1559476 1560602 Everybody calls him that.
1562437 1565523 Ah. Isn't she a beauty?
1565565 1568943 Three wheels,<br />43 miles per charge,
1569027 1570945 and bright red,<br />so you can see me coming.
1571029 1573615 And a little basket<br />for whatever you need.
1573698 1575366 I like to put bread in there.
1575450 1578453 Not... not a whole bread<br />but just little pieces.
1578536 1580038 You put them in loose?
1580121 1582957 No, no, no.<br />In... in bags. Ziploc.
1583041 1584751 You think I could borrow it?
1586169 1587212 Borrow my scooter?
1587587 1588671 Well, I...
1590423 1592217 I'm in a bit of a situation.
1592300 1595929 - What?<br />- I'm in a bit of a situation.
1596387 1597931 It's...
1598014 1600934 Oh, it's a headache.<br />The less you know, the better.
1601684 1604479 Well, if it involves<br />my scooter, it involves me.
1605396 1607816 I... I don't want to say<br />in front of Gary.
1609192 1611569 Uh, Gary, can you<br />give us a second?
1612737 1614405 Is he going to listen?
1614489 1616991 I'm not sure,<br />but he's going to watch.
1618576 1620078 Have you got a telephone?
1620161 1621162 Yes.
1626417 1628336 <i>Microphone enabled.</i>
1631214 1632924 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
1634384 1635969 <i>I got scammed,</i>
1636719 1639722 <i>but I have the address<br />where I sent the money.</i>
1639806 1646604 <i>It's a P.O. box in Van Nuys.<br />1534 San Fernando Road.</i>
1646646 1648731 <i>I'm on my way there now.</i>
1649190 1652694 <i>I'm going to try to figure out<br />who took it and get it back.</i>
1656739 1658199 <i>What are you, nuts?</i>
1658783 1661286 <i>That's absurd.<br />You got to tell the police.</i>
1661369 1665081 <i>- Oh, they're no use.<br />- What about your family?</i>
1665874 1669544 <i>- Not with this.<br />- It's a bad idea.</i>
1669627 1671504 <i>But you have a better one?</i>
1671588 1674507 <i>You're not thinking straight.<br />You're grieving.</i>
1675216 1678261 <i>At least you have your health.<br />Be grateful for that.</i>
1694360 1696946 Listen, why don't you stay<br />for lunch?
1697739 1702827 We have a beautiful cafeteria<br />and wonderful melons. Fresh.
1703453 1704453 Sure.
1706539 1708917 D... do you think<br />I could try it out?
1709000 1711294 I... I may be in the market<br />for one.
1713713 1717175 I love driving. I miss it.
1719219 1721262 Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
1751042 1752710 Winston, can I borrow<br />your scooter?
1753127 1756005 Winston. Ah, I'm taking it.
1762762 1764305 Uh, are you talking to me?
1769894 1772105 - Thel.<br />- Son of a bitch.
1772188 1773856 Stay there. I'm coming to you.
1790665 1791665 What?
1800216 1801759 Ow.
1807223 1808766 Dang it.
1814147 1815356 Oh.
1830538 1831538 Thelma.
1861235 1864197 - Let's just talk.<br />- Everybody wants to talk.
1864280 1867325 My God.<br />I just needed your scooter.
1867408 1869702 Please be a doll<br />and don't make a fuss.
1871204 1873289 My grandson's<br />parked a block away.
1873373 1874749 I don't have much time.
1874832 1876334 You left your grandson<br />in the car?
1876417 1878211 Well, he's 24.
1878294 1880838 Please don't make me<br />go through you,
1880922 1882590 - Ben.<br />- Oh, no, you couldn't.
1882673 1884217 I got a titanium hip.
1884300 1886511 Well, should we<br />put that to the test?
1886594 1888971 I'm going, with or without you.
1889389 1892392 I'm not going to let you<br />go alone. I won't.
1902360 1905446 Hi. Um, I'm looking<br />for my grandma.
1905530 1907156 Thelma Post. White hair.
1907240 1908533 A little wobbly.<br />Very determined.
1908616 1909534 Okay.
1909617 1910910 She's not... she's not...
1910993 1912596 She doesn't live here,<br />but she's visiting a friend.
1912620 1914098 She would have come in<br />like 30 minutes ago.
1914122 1915873 Huh.<br />So, I'm not seeing her here...
1915957 1917834 - Okay.<br />- but...
1920795 1922630 - Grandma?<br />- Hello?
1922713 1923923 Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry.
1924006 1926592 Uh, I'm just looking<br />for my grandma. Sorry.
1926676 1927927 - Hello?<br />- Hi, there.
1928010 1929554 - You took my scooter?<br />- What? No.
1929637 1931973 You sound like the man<br />who took my scooter.
1932056 1934517 I didn't take... I promise,<br />I... I... No, I'm...
1934600 1936662 You're getting me nervous.<br />You're getting me nervous.
1936686 1937520 Sorry. I'm gonna go.
1937603 1938683 - Yeah, go.<br />- Uh, good luck.
1938729 1940022 What do you mean, "Good luck?"
1940106 1941986 If you took my scooter,<br />don't tell me good luck.
1943234 1945027 Do you know Ben? Uh...
1945903 1947530 Uh, Halpern, I believe?
1951200 1953703 Mom, uh, we may have<br />a little situation here.
1953786 1956122 No, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.<br />No, I'm not in jail.
1956205 1958374 No. Um, it's Grandma.
1964505 1966257 I got to be back by 8:00.
1966340 1968384 It's opening night,<br />and I don't want to miss it.
1968468 1970094 I got it. I got it.
1982982 1984692 <i>Um, I checked every room.</i>
1984775 1985961 <i>She's not answering her phone,</i>
1985985 1988488 <i>but she should<br />have her Lyfe Line on.</i>
1988571 1991073 So has she ever<br />wandered off before?
1991157 1992450 Never. Not like this.
1992533 1994386 One time, I thought I lost her<br />at Souplantation,
1994410 1996829 but she was just going back<br />for, uh, little pizzas.
1996913 1998498 Souplantation.
1998581 2000684 It was a buffet restaurant.<br />You could go back for more.
2000708 2003961 I can't believe it was<br />actually called Souplantation.
2004045 2005588 - I never processed that.<br />- Oh, wow.
2005671 2007298 Well, it had things<br />she could chew.
2007381 2008381 She can't chew anything.
2008424 2009967 She can chew some things, Alan.
2010051 2011320 It's, like...<br />It's confusing, you know,
2011344 2012595 what she can and can't chew.
2012678 2015890 Like, she can't have a salad,<br />but she can...
2015973 2017558 Like, last week,<br />she ate a cashew.
2017642 2019101 So she hasn't<br />wandered off before?
2019185 2021812 Except to a salad bar?<br />By choice?
2022396 2023731 - Exactly. Right?<br />- Yeah.
2023814 2025858 Well, um, I don't want<br />to alarm you guys,
2025942 2028236 but one of our residents<br />is missing.
2028319 2030530 - Oh.<br />- Um, yeah. Ben Halpern.
2030613 2031840 - Oh, Ben.<br />- Yeah, she, she um...
2031864 2033032 Are the two of them involved?
2033115 2035826 No. No. They're...<br />they're not even...
2035910 2037870 She doesn't even really<br />like him all that much.
2037954 2039539 Oh, so is there bad blood?
2039622 2040974 - What are you insinuating?<br />- Nothing.
2040998 2042250 No, no, no. Not like that.
2042333 2044061 We're just... we're just<br />trying to understand.
2044085 2045670 You know he has a show tonight.
2045753 2047171 - How would we know that?<br />- No.
2047255 2048673 Well, does his family...
2048756 2050716 Have you notified<br />his family that he's missing?
2050800 2052552 He doesn't have any family.
2052635 2053928 - So, no.<br />- Oh.
2054011 2055304 Aww.
2055388 2056847 Well, what can we be doing here?
2056931 2059183 Can you guys send out<br />some kind of senior alert?
2059267 2060977 - Uh, Silver Alert?<br />- A Silver Alert.
2061018 2062270 - No.<br />- No.
2062353 2064021 We are not authorized<br />to do that.
2064063 2065773 The police have to declare her
2065856 2067125 - a missing person.<br />- A missing person.
2067149 2069235 But she is a missing person.
2069318 2071380 - Don't you have somebody...<br />- We don't know where she is.
2071404 2073507 - It's only been an hour, right?<br />- Yeah, just one hour.
2073531 2075324 Right, it hasn't been that long.
2075408 2076552 Yeah, curtain's not until 8:00.
2076576 2077660 What's the show?
2077743 2078887 You're still talking<br />about the show?
2078911 2079787 <i>- Annie.<br />- Annie.</i>
2079870 2081664 - Oh, that's a good one.<br />- Oh.
2081747 2084041 So, uh, does Thelma have any<br />specific medical conditions
2084125 2085251 that we should know about?
2085334 2088045 She's had breast cancer,<br />double mastectomy,
2088129 2090214 sepsis, edema,
2090298 2092800 valve replacement,<br />hip replacement,
2092883 2094510 arrhythmia, brain tumor.
2094594 2096280 I think she actually has<br />a brain tumor right now.
2096304 2097864 Yeah, the doctor said it was<br />growing slowly...
2097888 2099283 - That's right. Yeah.<br />- so they could...
2099307 2101076 - She has a brain tumor.<br />just leave it in there.
2101100 2103036 And, so, all of that and a<br />brain tumor at the moment.
2103060 2104060 Yeah.
2104604 2106355 Wow, uh, thank you.
2106439 2108524 Thank you so much<br />for telling us all of that.
2108608 2110151 And she had the TGA, right?
2110234 2113070 - TGA?<br />- Transient global amnesia.
2113154 2114780 Yeah, it was about a year ago.
2114864 2117408 And, um, she just...<br />she got very disoriented.
2117491 2119469 She didn't know who she was.<br />She didn't know who we were.
2119493 2121162 Lasted only just about an hour.
2122038 2123623 But it was... it was unsettling.
2125458 2127877 But she's a tough cookie.
2127960 2130087 Obviously, we want help<br />finding her.
2130171 2133674 It's just,<br />it might still be a, you know,
2134258 2137845 "going back to the buffet"<br />type of situation, I think.
2137928 2141682 Well, the good news is,<br />they rarely go far.
2168167 2169794 Uh, Thel,
2169877 2171796 why does this street<br />look so familiar to me?
2171879 2173589 We're stopping at Mona's.
2173673 2177134 Oh, I haven't seen Mona<br />since Berlin.
2177218 2179261 That was a fun trip, wasn't it?
2179720 2181722 What year was it? '95?
2181806 2184058 Um, '98, I think.
2184141 2187103 Ah, it was a bumpy flight,<br />but otherwise it was terrific.
2188729 2191565 You know Mona<br />is obsessed with me.
2191982 2193442 We... we never acted on it,
2193526 2195403 but she would always stare<br />at my legs
2195486 2197154 whenever I had short pants on.
2197238 2199907 Whatever you say, buddy.
2199990 2202743 Now, if you're right,<br />maybe we could use it.
2204328 2206163 Why are we stopping at Mona's?
2206205 2207331 To get a gun.
2207415 2210459 Oh, my God.<br />What do we need a gun for?
2210543 2212044 It's just a precaution.
2212128 2215381 Couple of schmegegges like us<br />turning up unannounced...
2215464 2217299 I like to be prepared.
2217383 2218843 Do you even know how to use it?
2218926 2222638 Well, how hard can it be?<br />Idiots use them all the time.
2223597 2226225 You're going to have<br />to distract her.
2226308 2227893 She's still sharp.
2227977 2229979 This is not going to be so easy.
2230062 2231981 Maybe I could do my monologue.
2232565 2234024 I'd rather you didn't.
2262386 2263471 Mona?
2265389 2268559 Thel, darling,<br />did we make a date?
2268642 2272021 Oh, no. No, no.<br />We were in the neighborhood.
2272104 2276442 - I would have put shoes on.<br />- Ben's here, too.
2276525 2277860 Good to see you, doll.
2279236 2282907 - Are you all right?<br />- Fine, fine.
2286368 2289497 Oh. Oh. Sit, dear.<br />Don't... don't clean.
2289580 2291665 Okay, okay.
2294543 2296378 Is it a roach?
2296462 2298506 Oh, you... you... you got bugs?
2298589 2302384 I've been hunting 'em.<br />Can't seem to knock 'em off.
2302468 2304261 Oh, they're resilient.
2304303 2307348 That's why they make<br />worthy adversaries.
2307431 2310726 You get one, there are<br />ten more to replace him.
2310810 2313062 I've learned to pick my battles.
2313896 2315773 So, uh, how are you?
2316732 2319109 - How's your health?<br />- I'm alive.
2319193 2321695 Oh, isn't that something?
2321779 2325074 - I got to use the bathroom.<br />- Oh, good, dear.
2327159 2329662 Um...
2329745 2332873 We were just talking<br />about Berlin.
2347555 2350933 We stayed<br />at that wonderful hotel.
2351433 2355604 The Kimch... Kimpinchky? Kimsky?
2355688 2357648 Did we take a trip?
2360609 2363237 Um, that was a long time ago.
2367908 2368908 Oh.
2371036 2374623 Um, you know,<br />I'm over at Belwood now.
2375666 2379169 They have<br />the most wonderful melons.
2421378 2422379 Cantaloupe.
2423797 2425049 Honeydew.
2426425 2427676 Jade dews.
2429386 2431013 - Berries.<br />- Berries?
2431096 2433265 Mm, yeah. All kinds of berries.
2434391 2437394 Raspberries. Blueberries.
2452242 2453327 Blackberries.
2455371 2456622 Cherries.
2472429 2474181 Uh, elderberries.
2480813 2484733 "Annie, get your goddamn hound<br />out of my pool."
2489530 2492950 Thel, did we make a date?
2493742 2496078 Oh, no, no, I...
2496161 2497997 I was just in the neighborhood.
2498080 2500916 I would have put my shoes on.
2502668 2506296 Well, I think it's time<br />we were on our way.
2506380 2509717 - You're leaving?<br />- I know, I know.
2509800 2511927 We'll have to get<br />a lunch on the books.
2512011 2513262 I'd like that.
2514138 2516974 Can we get you anything?
2517057 2519184 I've got everything I need.
2524189 2525189 Goodbye, doll.
2566815 2570861 - Uh, she needs a charge.<br />- Oh.
2572571 2574531 I need to get IDs from everyone.
2575240 2576784 Sure. Here.
2579161 2580162 Thank you.
2583082 2584374 Can't find your wallet?
2584458 2586877 I... I, um... I have it.<br />I'm just not seeing my JD.
2586960 2588354 You're not even looking.<br />You're just patting.
2588378 2589379 Oh, yeah.
2589797 2592174 - Let me help.<br />- I, uh... Uh...
2592257 2593926 You didn't order<br />a replacement license?
2594009 2595844 - No, I did. I did.<br />- Don't lie.
2595928 2597596 - It's in there.<br />- Just tell us you didn't
2597679 2599640 - I'd rather know than be lied to.<br />- It's...
2600474 2602017 I haven't, uh, yet.
2602101 2604061 - Why would you keep this from us?<br />- Becau...
2604144 2605896 Why would you keep this<br />from us? This sucks.
2605979 2607916 - Daniel, that's really bad.<br />- But I'm... I'm gonna do it.
2607940 2608958 Can't drive without a license.
2608982 2610210 He can't drive<br />without a license.
2610234 2611753 I mean, he could,<br />but he... he shouldn't.
2611777 2613028 Okay, thank you, everyone.
2613112 2616156 You have to take care<br />of your vehicle, Daniel.
2616240 2617759 - Do you understand my...<br />- I understand.
2617783 2619243 This is the basics<br />of adult life.
2619326 2622746 Dad, please don't embarrass me<br />in front of...
2623872 2625999 Colin... and Rochelle.
2626083 2627918 We can give you guys a second.
2634842 2636593 Allie was very good for you<br />in that way.
2636677 2638846 She was very organized,
2639429 2642766 left-brained, a grounding force.
2642850 2645102 Can we please not talk<br />about Allie?
2645185 2647479 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2647563 2649523 - Thank you.<br />- I know it's hard.
2649982 2652109 I just don't like<br />to see you suffer like this.
2653277 2656071 - Makes me want to cry.<br />- What? No.
2656155 2657990 I do. It makes me very sad.
2658073 2659658 - It's okay.<br />- I have to cry.
2659741 2662703 - Okay.<br />- I just need to get it out.
2664997 2666540 Do you want us to...
2667749 2671253 sit with you and...<br />to get a replacement license?
2671336 2672336 I... I can handle it.
2672713 2675007 - Let's just deal with one...<br />- I'm sorry.
2675090 2676925 family crisis at a time, okay?
2683056 2686810 Chaim took this. My cousin.
2687853 2689354 Did you ever meet Chaim?
2689438 2691398 - No.<br />- From Hinsdale.
2692524 2693775 He's not doing so hot,
2693859 2695652 but this is a beautiful picture.
2697154 2698822 She shouldn't be living<br />like that.
2700199 2701658 She's managing.
2702409 2704870 How is she getting her meals?
2704953 2707623 Uh, and when is the last time<br />she got out of that chair?
2708332 2709499 She's wasting away.
2709583 2713086 We all have our good days<br />and our bad days.
2713170 2715464 - And what's today?<br />- We'll find out.
2719051 2720802 Gary's going to wonder<br />where I am.
2720886 2724097 What's with you?<br />Do you miss that place?
2724181 2727517 - I like that place.<br />- What's to like?
2727601 2731480 I swim twice a week.<br />There's wonderful classes...
2731563 2734983 cooking classes,<br />painting classes, oopsie upsy.
2735067 2736735 - "Oopsie upsy"?<br />- Oopsie upsy.
2736818 2738946 That's when a professional<br />comes in and shows us
2739029 2741198 how to pick each other up<br />after we fall.
2741281 2743784 There's a tub lift,<br />a shower lift,
2743867 2746203 and a dual lift<br />for when a couple falls.
2746286 2748038 Does that happen often?
2748121 2752000 Uh, not often, but it happens.<br />Usually on a hill.
2752084 2755712 You have to use each other's<br />weight as a counterbalance.
2755754 2757214 Sounds interesting.
2761510 2765180 Cheryl used to cook,<br />pick up our socks,
2765264 2766932 keep the place together.
2767891 2770477 I'll take help<br />where I can get it.
2770560 2772020 I'm not ashamed.
2772938 2774314 It's not the same.
2775565 2776565 Why?
2777109 2779111 I always picked up the socks.
2785826 2786827 Hm.
2795669 2798130 - She posted. What?<br />She posted something?
2798213 2799423 - I think it...<br />- No.
2799506 2800900 Yeah, five minutes...<br />By accident, I think.
2800924 2802342 - Five minutes ago.<br />- Oh, my God.
2802426 2804386 - Look, look.<br />- Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.
2804469 2805345 Do you recognize anything?
2805429 2806722 Make it bigger. Zoom in.
2806763 2808724 - Can you enhance it?<br />- Enhancing.
2808765 2810976 I see gas pumps,<br />a blue car, a pigeon.
2811059 2812745 - No, two pigeons.<br />- This is Tujunga. Tujunga.
2812769 2814062 - Yeah, um...<br />- Oh, isn't there
2814146 2815498 - a gas station on Tujunga?<br />- Moorpark
2815522 2816440 - and Tujunga.<br />- Yes!
2816523 2817607 Moorpark and Tujunga.
2817691 2818851 And we're going, we're going.
2822070 2823070 Ah, damn.
2827784 2830245 Come on. We g... We got to move.
2830329 2834416 Waze says 12 minutes<br />via Chandler and Colfax.
2837461 2838712 Look at that.
2839129 2841965 Who created that?<br />Who thought it up?
2843216 2844801 A plug for a car.
2845385 2848430 Electricity goes through,<br />makes it run.
2849181 2852642 But what is electricity?<br />It boggles the mind.
2854644 2857147 Oh, I think I know her.
2860108 2862444 - Can you go a little faster?<br />- Yes, thank you.
2862527 2864571 - God. Please.<br />- I'm going the speed limit.
2865280 2867324 We are a law-abiding family.
2872454 2874206 Huh.
2875040 2876458 Wants me to make a left.
2877376 2879461 This is why I don't use Waze.
2879544 2881546 It wants you to make<br />all these crazy turns.
2881630 2884424 Marcy Wender's husband<br />was obsessed with Waze,
2884508 2886843 makes a psycho left,<br />ends up in Vons.
2886885 2887945 Estimates are<br />very accurate, Gail.
2887969 2889763 He paid thousands of dollars.
2889846 2891390 - No they're not.<br />- It's been proven.
2891473 2893433 Do you know Vi? Vi Friedlander?
2894017 2896144 - Maybe through Saul.<br />- Saul?
2896603 2900357 - Gary's kid. Gary Newman?<br />- No, I don't know them.
2900941 2906113 - Oh. Did you go to Sinai?<br />- No, we were at Beth Am.
2906196 2908865 You just look so terribly<br />familiar to me.
2908949 2910534 Just have to ignore<br />all your instincts
2910617 2911743 and trust the technology.
2911827 2913870 Technology is what got us<br />into this mess
2913954 2915497 in the first place.<br />Can you go back?
2915580 2917420 - I can't go back.<br />- There's someone behind us.
2917457 2918834 - I see them.<br />- So, go.
2918875 2920168 - I can't go.<br />- There's a gap.
2920252 2921795 - There's a...<br />- There's a gap, Alan.
2921878 2923922 - Take it!<br />- Go, just go.
2925841 2926842 Go. Yes, yes.
2926883 2928885 - Yes, yes, yes.<br />- Yes, yes, yes.
2928927 2930303 Okay, okay, okay.
2930387 2932722 Ah!
2932806 2935475 Yes, yes, I did.
2936518 2938019 And we're back to 12 minutes.
2939020 2940439 Gary Newman.
2940522 2942983 Oh, no. My Gary is Rozelle.
2943066 2944526 Isn't that interesting?
2944609 2947070 Two different Garys,<br />but both Gary.
2949990 2953034 - How do you know each other?<br />- I guess we don't.
2953118 2955245 It seemed possible.
2955328 2956663 Alas.
2956746 2958165 Have a lovely day.
2958248 2962586 You too.
2971636 2973096 What?
2975640 2976892 - What?<br />- Oh.
2978310 2980812 - What happened?<br />- It... it's my grandson.
2982814 2985025 - Mom! Thelma!<br />- Grandma!
2985108 2987486 Oh, it's them. Come on, get out.
2989529 2990864 - Thelma!<br />- Thelma!
2990947 2992032 Hi. Have you seen a woman
2992115 2994034 with, like, white hair?<br />A real lady?
2995327 2997078 - Thelma!<br />- Thelma!
2997871 3000707 - Thelma!<br />- Thelma!
3000790 3003543 Oh, we can't make that.
3003627 3004628 Grandma.
3004711 3005962 What's that? Is that...
3006004 3007380 - Grandma!<br />- That is interesting.
3007464 3009466 - Oh, shit.<br />- Thelma!
3013220 3014346 - Oh, shit.<br />- What?
3014429 3015555 Her Lifeline.
3015639 3017474 What is it?<br />Do you have a location?
3017557 3019100 - What's it say?<br />- She's here.
3019184 3020977 - She's here.<br />- Ah. Where? Oh.
3050507 3052467 We are crazy.
3077033 3078910 <i>Could it have fallen off?</i>
3079452 3080704 Not on its own.
3081538 3084082 Just to consider<br />all our options,
3084165 3086710 is it... is it possible<br />she had another TGA?
3086793 3088396 - Her behavior's erratic.<br />- I... I don't know. Yeah.
3088420 3090839 I mean, it seems like it's<br />within the realm of possibility.
3090922 3092817 I'm... I'm just... I'm going<br />to Google it just to...
3092841 3094884 I told her not to take it off.
3096177 3097971 "Acute onset<br />of anterograde amnesia."
3098054 3102767 I can't remember if it was<br />on her wrist in the car.
3102851 3105520 She likes her independence<br />from that thing. She just...
3105604 3106872 Sometimes she puts it<br />in her bag.
3106896 3109816 I... I can't remember.
3109899 3112319 "signs indicating damage<br />to a particular area..."
3112402 3113945 I should have walked her in.
3114029 3115989 It's in the past. Hmm?
3118992 3120285 Why didn't you?
3120368 3122746 - She didn't want me to.<br />- Why didn't she want you to?
3122829 3125123 - I don't know, Mom. I...<br />- Don't yell.
3125206 3128251 I'm sorry, I'm sorry,<br />I just... I'm upset.
3128335 3130086 Yeah, we're all upset.
3130837 3134215 This is exactly what<br />we have been trying to avoid,
3134758 3136718 and now my mother is at large.
3136801 3139804 I can't... I can't do anything.
3139888 3143224 I literally can't do anything.<br />I'm such a little bitch.
3143850 3145769 Don't call yourself that. God.
3145852 3150106 I truly have<br />no ability to do anything.
3150190 3152692 I can't do anything<br />with my hands. I can't...
3152776 3154211 What do you want to do<br />with your hands?
3154235 3155880 I don't know. Nothing.<br />I just... I can't...
3155904 3157280 I don't know facts.
3157364 3159115 I have no qualifications<br />for any jobs.
3159157 3160450 I... I can't do math.
3160533 3162410 It's basically why Allie<br />and I aren't together.
3162494 3166122 Because you couldn't do math?<br />I thought she could do math.
3166206 3168500 It's just another thing<br />that I can't do.
3168583 3170126 I haven't done the I.D.
3170210 3172087 because every time<br />I go on the computer,
3172128 3174464 I get all confused<br />by the stupid website
3174547 3176633 and all the classifications
3176716 3178551 and the... and the...<br />and the terms.
3178635 3180887 Do you have visual,<br />uh, what's it?
3180970 3184349 - Processing.<br />- Processing issues?
3185016 3187394 Sure. Or maybe I'm just<br />a stupid little bitch
3187477 3188996 - who can't do anything.<br />- Don't say "bitch."
3189020 3190122 - Stop.<br />- Stop saying "bitch."
3190146 3192399 I lost Grandma. Fuck!
3211000 3212544 Think we're getting closer?
3221511 3223763 - Thelma?<br />- Hang on.
3224764 3227142 - What is it?<br />- I don't know where we are.
3227183 3228643 Oh, don't say that.
3228727 3231104 I thought we were heading north.
3233148 3234774 I'm gonna go find help.
3234858 3238653 Oh, no, Ben, give me a moment.<br />Let me orient myself.
3239195 3240822 Ben.
3243867 3246202 Ben, don't make a scene.
3246244 3249289 You don't listen to me, Thel.<br />You don't listen to anybody.
3249664 3253501 If I listened to you,<br />I'd be your roommate by now.
3253585 3255211 Go home, Ben.<br />You don't want to be here.
3255295 3258798 - We should call your family.<br />- Out of the question.
3258882 3260717 - What about your grandson?<br />- No.
3260800 3261926 - No.<br />- Why?
3262010 3264471 Because I'm not like you, Ben.
3264554 3268475 As much as you may want me<br />to be, I like to be useful.
3269142 3271269 We're more alike than you think.
3271352 3273146 What's that supposed to mean?
3273229 3274481 We're old.
3275899 3276941 Diminished.
3277484 3279861 We're a liability<br />to the ones we love.
3280528 3282280 You can tell yourself different,
3282989 3285241 but you know<br />that they're worried sick.
3285825 3287535 What's to worry about?
3287619 3290955 I move from point to point.<br />I don't complain.
3291039 3294125 I am the same.<br />And you would be, too,
3294209 3296252 if you stopped feeling sorry<br />for yourself.
3296294 3298129 It doesn't work that way.
3298213 3300441 You start acting like a baby,<br />people treat you like a baby.
3300465 3301591 Bullshit.
3303218 3305762 You know how I know?<br />Because I couldn't...
3306221 3308181 I couldn't hear her<br />when she fell.
3314562 3316272 We're not what we were.
3320443 3321903 We're the only ones left.
3322987 3325532 The least we can do<br />is take care of each other.
3329118 3330912 Call your family.
3334916 3338503 I don't need them.<br />I don't need you.
3338586 3341840 I just needed your scooter.
3356312 3358690 We were stopped.
3358773 3360483 Did you put<br />the parking brake on?
3360942 3363236 I didn't know there was one.
3363319 3366322 I didn't know.<br />I... I'm sorry, Ben.
3367115 3368658 You're not sorry.
3371035 3373329 Ben, where are you going?
3377292 3379002 I'm not waiting!
3392849 3394934 <i>We've all lost her before.</i>
3395643 3397478 I've lost her at Gelson's<br />a few times.
3398021 3399522 The woman likes to keep moving.
3399606 3401232 Especially if she has that cart.
3401733 3403085 When she sets her mind<br />to something,
3403109 3404109 there's no stopping her.
3404152 3405820 She doesn't eat,<br />she doesn't sleep.
3405904 3408740 She just, like,<br />keeps that laser focus...
3408823 3410950 - Hmm.<br />- till the task is done.
3411034 3412702 This is different than Gelson's.
3412785 3414203 Well, I'm aware it's different.
3414287 3415455 But she's a grown woman
3415538 3417457 who's a little faster<br />than you would hope.
3418041 3419667 And you can't<br />be responsible for her
3419751 3421419 every second of every day.
3421502 3423087 We shouldn't have<br />put that on you.
3423171 3424297 It was too much.
3424714 3427091 I know that<br />she's not gonna live forever.
3429010 3431846 But I just... when it happens,
3431930 3436768 I want it to be not horrific,<br />you know?
3438853 3440813 Like, a good death.
3442357 3443816 There is no good death.
3449572 3450823 I'm gonna take a walk.
3450907 3452158 Oh, can we go with you?
3452241 3454285 - I'll go with him.<br />- I want to go with him.
3454369 3456913 No, no, no, no, I'm...<br />I want to go alone.
3456996 3458414 I just need a little, um...
3459123 3460601 - space to think.<br />- Where are you walking?
3460625 3462394 - Where are you gonna go?<br />- I don't know, just...
3462418 3464295 Do you... do you have<br />your phone on you?
3464796 3466036 Please don't keep it on silent.
3466089 3467849 - No. Here. Take...<br />- Can you do that for me?
3467882 3469759 - Take this.<br />- For my mental health?
3469842 3471135 I'm gonna be close. It's fine.
3471219 3474389 - Just... It's fully charged.<br />- Okay.
3474430 3476182 And it just snaps on here.
3476808 3477850 There we go.
3478893 3481562 Have a nice walk. I love you.
3481646 3482689 I love you, too.
3586834 3590880 Oh. Oh.
3591672 3592715 Oh.
3625206 3626249 Oh.
3750706 3751707 Ah.
3754210 3755503 Thank you.
3756087 3757171 You're welcome.
3758965 3762176 I'm sorry. About all of it.
3763469 3765721 But we gave it a good try,<br />didn't we?
3767098 3768349 Yes, we did.
3773020 3777650 I lived with my parents<br />till I was 23.
3777733 3779402 Then I moved in with Teddy...
3780486 3783447 and I lived with him<br />until I was 91.
3784699 3788452 I've lived just me<br />for two years now.
3789829 3791956 Gets lonely sometimes.
3794709 3796127 And I miss Teddy.
3799130 3803050 But I... I tried sushi,<br />and I liked that quite a bit.
3807722 3809765 I've enjoyed my time alone.
3813894 3816022 I guess I wanted more of it.
3826198 3828034 I think I know her.
3829368 3831954 - Lois?<br />- Thelma!
3835041 3837335 We just saw <i>Swan Lake.</i>
3837418 3840504 And it was set<br />during the Korean War,
3840588 3843215 so the dancers were<br />all dressed like soldiers.
3843299 3845176 I... I don't know<br />that I understood it,
3845259 3850097 but it was beautifully staged.<br />I think it was very political.
3850181 3852808 - Sounds interesting.<br />- It was, yes.
3853184 3854727 So, where can we take you?
3854810 3858230 Oh. Just home.<br />Ben, what's your address?
3858314 3862443 We're heading<br />to 1534 San Fernando Road.
3865029 3868074 Well, we've come this far.<br />We might as well finish it.
3868157 3869867 Well, what about your show?
3870701 3874705 There is no show<br />without Daddy Warbucks.
3908989 3910199 Twenty-one.
3911992 3914453 - What now?<br />- We wait.
3915371 3917081 <i>- Hi.<br />- Hey.</i>
3917164 3919959 Thanks for picking up. Um...
3920876 3925256 Are you slinging those<br />crunchy-crunchy tiki tacos?
3925965 3928968 Yeah. Yeah, that's why<br />they pay me the big bucks.
3929844 3931345 How's it going with you?
3931804 3932972 <i>Okay.</i>
3933514 3935307 Um, bad, actually.
3936600 3938352 My grandma's missing,
3938436 3941147 <i>and I'm camped out<br />at an old folks' home</i>
3941230 3943566 <i>- with my parents.</i><br />- Wait, what? How?
3943649 3945609 She went to visit a friend,
3945693 3947361 and then they went<br />missing together.
3947445 3949029 <i>It's been a couple hours so far.</i>
3949113 3951091 <i>I mean, the whole thing<br />is just... I don't know, it's...</i>
3951115 3952825 They didn't sign out<br />or anything,
3952908 3954618 but I was supposed<br />to watch her, so...
3954702 3959665 Okay, well, uh, could she have<br />just gone somewhere
3959748 3960916 without telling you guys?
3960958 3962251 <i>That's what we thought.</i>
3962334 3963895 We thought it could be<br />a Souplantation situation.
3963919 3965254 <i>A... a what?</i>
3965337 3967840 No, nothing. I mean,<br />it's possible, I guess.
3967923 3969758 Well, I only asked<br />because she's...
3970801 3972970 obsessed with errands, right?
3973053 3975890 Well, yeah. She has<br />a healthy respect for errands.
3976390 3978058 Well, I know<br />you really love her.
3978142 3980227 I'm sure you're<br />super worried, but...
3980769 3984690 Maybe she's just<br />doing something.
3985191 3987818 <i>You know? On her own.</i>
3988486 3989778 Yeah.
3991572 3992656 I hope so.
3994450 3996660 <i>Hey, I've also<br />been wanting to call you.</i>
3996744 3999538 <i>I was thinking about<br />taking some classes,</i>
3999622 4001415 maybe an adult math class,
4001499 4005085 or, like, just brush up on...<br />on some of those essentials.
4005169 4007089 - What are you talking about?<br /><i>- Self-improvement.</i>
4007129 4009548 I'm just saying I...<br />I can learn to do more things,
4009632 4012843 adding and subtracting,<br />uh, fractals.
4012927 4015888 Like, I can take the great<br />leap from boy to man.
4015971 4017571 You're driving me nuts,<br />do you know that?
4017598 4020976 I do. I...<br />I do know that, very much.
4022102 4024188 Sorry.<br />It's so freaking hot in here.
4024271 4026482 Okay, well, go for a walk.
4026565 4028400 My folks asked me to stay close.
4030486 4032655 <i>Well, if you ever take<br />that great leap,</i>
4033447 4036534 for what it's worth,<br />I think you could make it.
4038744 4040829 - Oh, my God!<br /><i>- What?</i>
4040913 4044500 Um, there's, uh, been a guy<br />in here the whole time.
4046293 4049713 We used to call bread<br />the staff of life.
4050881 4053801 But now nobody wants<br />to eat bread.
4055094 4058347 But there are delicious breads<br />being made now.
4058430 4060057 It's a conundrum.
4060140 4062685 And some people like toast<br />with toppings.
4062768 4064436 Mm. Interesting.
4065312 4067898 The way we think about bread<br />has changed, so.
4068357 4071819 You want bread? We've got bread.
4072653 4074363 There you go.
4078867 4081078 Ugh!
4081495 4083706 - Oh, it's like a rock.<br />- I couldn't even chew it.
4100472 4102808 - Can you see him?<br />- That's him.
4108439 4110065 Ah, he's coming out.
4117865 4119158 Oh, come on.
4158447 4159782 You keep a lookout.
4160324 4163452 Uh, I'm gonna go in<br />and try to talk to them.
4164078 4167122 If things get funny,<br />you go for help.
4167206 4170376 - How will I know?<br />- Well, you'll be with me.
4173420 4175381 <i>Microphone enabled.</i>
4178133 4179468 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
4200280 4201407 Hello?
4202366 4204868 <i>Thel, I think I see a door<br />in the back.</i>
4216130 4218590 <i>Lamp down ahead.<br />Lift those heels.</i>
4225431 4227474 <i>There's a stack<br />of loose Hummels, or...</i>
4227558 4228851 <i>or maybe they're gnomes</i>
4228934 4231520 <i>or some kind of little animals.</i>
4231603 4232813 <i>Be... be careful.</i>
4242197 4243741 <i>Gets a little hairy up ahead.</i>
4244199 4245367 Take your time.
4251331 4252541 Oh!
4253500 4254543 <i>What happened?</i>
4255085 4257755 Oh. W... what are you doing?
4257838 4259339 It's a mess.
4260382 4261759 Don't clean!
4261842 4264595 Well, you have to<br />with glass. It's not right.
4264678 4267765 <i>Not now. Get your act together.</i>
4275063 4277608 <i>- Easy, easy.</i><br />- Ah.
4280903 4286241 Uh, yes! Ah!<br />Well done. Well done, Thel.
4286784 4288243 <i>Okay. Let's go.</i>
4290245 4291288 Yes, sir.
4292122 4294249 Hesitating is gonna cost you.
4295042 4296418 Yeah, quite a bit.
4297377 4301048 No, there's gonna be<br />some unpleasantness ahead.
4301131 4303467 I mean, we just don't want him<br />sitting in holding
4303550 4305385 any longer than he has to.
4305469 4308764 Yes, I know, but even<br />good boys make mistakes.
4316814 4319441 - Hi. May I help you?<br />- Who's that?
4319525 4322986 I'm Thelma. Thelma Post.
4324655 4325739 Huh.
4325823 4327741 You might recognize me.
4329201 4330702 From the telephone.
4331411 4335290 Hmm. No, I can't say<br />I do, ma'am.
4336083 4338043 Uh, at this moment in time,<br />we're closed.
4338126 4339521 But why don't you<br />come back tomorrow?
4339545 4341630 I've got a shipment of, uh,<br />what do you call them?
4341713 4344383 A woman inside a woman<br />inside a woman.
4344466 4347052 - Uh, Russian nesting dolls?<br />- Yeah.
4347135 4350138 Now, at least I think they're<br />women. I mean, I haven't checked.
4350222 4352558 There may be a little fella<br />in there somewhere.
4352641 4354059 Where's my money?
4358564 4360357 - Sorry?<br />- You heard me.
4360440 4363402 Yes, I heard you.<br />I'm not sure I understood.
4364111 4365320 You called me.
4366029 4368240 You pretended to be my grandson.
4369157 4371243 You took advantage of me.
4387676 4389636 That's a hefty accusation.
4390178 4392097 I think you've got<br />the wrong idea.
4393015 4396018 Listen, buddy,<br />I came a long way.
4397311 4399313 Hm, well, you've made a mistake.
4399688 4402357 That's okay. You know,<br />I make mistakes, too.
4402399 4404902 But let's not make another.
4408697 4411366 I'm... I'm contacting<br />the authorities.
4416997 4418457 Well, what are you<br />gonna tell 'em?
4418540 4420042 You broke into my store?
4420125 4421543 <i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>
4421627 4423962 I'd like to report a robbery.<br />Ah! Uh, uh...
4425797 4426965 The... Thel?
4428508 4430135 Thel, are you there?
4430218 4433430 Look, I just want you to know<br />that it's not personal.
4434014 4436808 I mean, we're not<br />selling like we used to.
4436892 4438477 People these days, they...
4438560 4440520 they don't care<br />about old things.
4441104 4443565 I'm just trying<br />to keep the lights on.
4443649 4444983 We have a lot of lights.
4446193 4449696 - So, it's very expensive.<br />- Yeah. Thank you, Michael.
4451198 4454117 I bet this whole thing<br />has been a headache, huh?
4454201 4457704 Look, I don't expect you<br />to leave here empty-handed.
4458455 4460374 Why don't we make a deal, huh?
4460415 4461833 I'll keep your deposit,
4461917 4463794 but I'll cut you in<br />on the next one.
4464336 4466463 Yeah, I'm happy to negotiate.
4466546 4468173 I'll give you<br />the senior discount.
4468256 4470509 Well, that isn't gonna work<br />for me.
4471551 4472844 And you should know,
4472928 4474972 if I'm not out in five minutes,
4475055 4477307 my partner calls the cops.
4478725 4479893 You want me to beg?
4481520 4482729 Then I'll beg.
4488193 4490904 Look, what do you want me to do?
4490988 4492239 Give it back?
4492322 4494574 I'll lose the store.<br />I'll be out on the street.
4495450 4496785 Nobody cares.
4498286 4499997 Nobody cares about me.
4500580 4503208 Everybody's buying<br />their shit on Amazon.
4504084 4506545 I just take<br />what I need to survive.
4507170 4509506 So, why do you need it so bad?
4509589 4513385 Because it's mine,<br />and I decide who gets it.
4515470 4517055 You're being unreasonable.
4519391 4521435 Michael, get my keys.
4526982 4528275 Ah...
4529776 4531862 Uh, uh...
4531945 4533905 - Huh?<br />- No, no. I, uh...
4533989 4536199 How did I... huh.
4536825 4540162 Uh, I, uh... oh. Ah.
4540579 4543206 I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
4543290 4546501 I... I don't recognize<br />this pla...
4547294 4549254 Oh. I, uh...
4550380 4554468 I... I need to call my husband.
4556470 4558013 Hm. Of course.
4558680 4560098 What's your name, dear?
4560182 4562184 - I'm Harvey.<br />- Harvey?
4562684 4565771 - Yeah.<br />- Harvey? Harvey.
4565854 4567022 Come and sit down now.
4567105 4568106 Harvey.
4568190 4569316 We'll call him. Yeah, yeah.
4569399 4571443 Talk to me, Thel.<br />What's going on?
4577199 4579868 I'm terribly sorry<br />for the imposition.
4579951 4581703 Oh, please. It's all right.
4581787 4583789 No. Happens to the best of us.
4583872 4585499 The mind is a funny thing.
4585540 4586851 Now,<br />what's your husband's number?
4586875 4588376 I'll get you home.
4593006 4594674 My money, Harvey.
4597427 4599679 Michael! Coward.
4617781 4620325 You were<br />very convincing, Harvey.
4620408 4622119 Why, you could have<br />been an actor.
4622202 4625372 Not a star, maybe,<br />but even so, what a waste.
4625455 4627124 Do you know<br />how to use that thing?
4627791 4629793 No.
4629876 4633547 Fuck! Jesus Christ!<br />Okay, okay, okay.
4633588 4634714 Where is it?
4636633 4638593 - In there.<br />- Where?
4638635 4641721 It's been deposited into<br />my account on the computer.
4641805 4643849 - Well, get it out.<br />- I can't.
4643932 4646601 - What do you mean, you can't?<br />- Michael does the computers.
4646643 4649437 Oh, this is ridiculous. Oh.
4655569 4658613 It's just me and you now.
4659489 4660615 And me.
4661950 4664661 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- My friend.
4665537 4670250 Here. Here, you take this.<br />I... I need both hands.
4670750 4673628 - What happened to Michael?<br />- I beat him up.
4674629 4678175 Where's the mouse?<br />There's the mouse.
4678925 4680343 Come on. Move.
4684723 4687601 What? What is that? It's a shoe!
4687642 4689436 - It looks like a shoe.<br />- It's a shoe.
4689519 4691730 Ben, don't look at it.<br />Look at him.
4692230 4695317 W... what do I do with it?<br />I... I'm gonna "X" it.
4695400 4696651 No, no, don't do that!
4696735 4698570 Well, you don't know what it is.
4706912 4708413 That's a baby.
4709706 4713251 Oh, God.<br />I don't know how to do this.
4723053 4724053 Hello?
4724095 4725013 <i>Danny?</i>
4725096 4726890 Grandma! Oh, my God.
4726973 4729851 Are you... okay? Where are you?
4729935 4731519 <i>I'll tell you,</i>
4731603 4733605 <i>but you have to promise me<br />something.</i>
4733688 4734648 What?
4734689 4735982 <i>Come alone.</i>
4746868 4747953 - Huh.<br />- What?
4749246 4750538 His heart rate is slowing.
4753375 4754626 We're getting closer.
4754709 4756336 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- We're getting closer.
4756419 4758171 I just... okay,<br />now a little more,
4758255 4760006 little more, little more.<br />Ah! Ah!
4780652 4782195 Tell me what you're looking at!
4782279 4785699 It... it's a family and a baby,<br />and they're everywhere.
4785740 4787200 <i>Great, great. Are there words?</i>
4787284 4789744 Yeah, it says,<br />uh, Lincoln Mutual.
4789828 4792998 Yep! It's an ad.<br />You need to find the "X."
4793081 4796084 - Well, there's no red "X."<br />- No, but it's not always red.
4796167 4798586 Sometimes they hide it,<br />so look closer.
4801840 4803049 Top right.
4809180 4812350 - I "X"ed it.<br />- Great! Um...
4813059 4815562 Remember the...
4815645 4817272 the computer's the library,
4817355 4819149 and the search bar's<br />the librarian.
4819232 4821901 <i>You're gonna ask it<br />for information,</i>
4821985 4823345 <i>and then it's gonna<br />give it to you.</i>
4823695 4824988 <i>Where is the bank?</i>
4825071 4827198 Ye... uh, are you talking to me?
4827282 4829576 No, I... I'm asking the machine.
4829659 4831244 It can't hear you.
4831328 4833913 Is there a Sari or a Siri,<br />or is she not in there?
4833997 4835725 She's not there.<br />That... that's in your phone.
4835749 4836767 But y... you don't need her.
4836791 4837876 <i>I don't talk to her.</i>
4837959 4839210 <i>She talks to me.</i>
4849846 4851222 "Valley...
4852223 4854517 financial...
4854601 4856519 dot-com.
4856603 4859481 Hit "Enter." You see "Enter"?
4861316 4862400 I'm in!
4875455 4876831 What's the password?
4876873 4878124 I don't know.
4878208 4881294 Look around you.<br />Is there, uh, a notebook
4881378 4884339 <i>or a desk, papers,<br />anything like that?</i>
4887258 4889469 - Oh, my God.<br /><i>- What?</i>
4889552 4891513 The password is "Password."
4891596 4893014 <i>Classic!</i>
4893098 4895558 Now, click inside of that box<br />and type that in.
4897018 4898395 That's cute.
4898478 4901523 Goddamn dumb-ass.<br />Password, Michael?
4909072 4910323 Come on!
4912700 4914869 I'm moving to "Transfer."
4916579 4918415 Oh, God.
4918498 4921751 - What?<br />- It wants me to join a gym!
4923253 4925046 No, I... I'm gonna tell it no.
4925130 4927006 Good. Remember what we do?
4927090 4929259 The "X," no matter the color.
4929342 4930593 <i>That's right!</i>
4933513 4935557 - I'm in.<br />- Yes!
4935640 4937100 <i>Be ready in five.</i>
4937183 4938351 Okay, I'll be there soon.
4945108 4947527 Oh, Jesus.
4973303 4974762 Uh, no! Oof.
4985899 4988109 I assume it was you
4988193 4990445 on the phone<br />pretending to be Danny.
4992071 4993948 He doesn't have the range.
4996493 4997952 I'm not your grandma.
4999787 5002081 But if I was, I'd tell you<br />there comes a time
5002165 5005335 when you can't listen<br />to anyone but yourself.
5013635 5015762 He called you a dumb-ass.
5017096 5019516 He said it quietly,<br />but I heard it.
5037200 5039994 Ah!
5040453 5042205 You're insane.
5055927 5058346 - Is that it?<br />- That's it.
5059389 5060974 And he can't get it back?
5071609 5072986 Hey, wait!
5075738 5079742 He can't get it back.
5085707 5087709 Don't take people's money.
5088626 5090044 Clean up your store.
5091129 5092797 Be nicer to Michael.
5093881 5097385 This whole thing<br />has been really ridiculous.
5099262 5102390 And don't smoke.
5125371 5127665 - What?<br />- I didn't say anything.
5127749 5128749 Oh.
5134213 5135465 Get in!
5147602 5148811 Did you get it?
5151981 5153066 We got it.
5157070 5159405 Oh, Danny, Danny,<br />you remember Ben.
5159489 5161824 Yeah. Hey, Ben,<br />it's really great to see you.
5161908 5163409 Good to see, Danny.<br />How you doing?
5163493 5166746 I'm all right. Yeah.
5168623 5172877 Whoa. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.<br />We're famous.
5173419 5175338 Ha, ha!
5175421 5176589 Hello!
5180968 5183888 Today was a good day.
5183971 5186140 I hope you know<br />I'm gonna buy you
5186182 5188309 a new scooter and a new phone.
5188393 5191646 Oh, well, maybe we can go out<br />to lunch someday.
5191729 5192897 I'd like that.
5192980 5196234 We could try<br />the famous Belwood cafeteria.
5196317 5198152 I hear they have<br />terrific melons.
5200613 5204200 - Or... we could go out.<br />- Both good options.
5204867 5207829 - We'll make a plan, dear.<br />- Good, good, good.
5207912 5210498 Ah!
5213167 5215002 - You be well.<br />- I will.
5220758 5222051 Break a leg, Ben!
5227557 5229642 Does he know what that means?
5229726 5231018 I'm not sure.
5231853 5236357 He's new to the theater,<br />and his hip is titanium.
5237150 5238526 But he didn't say anything?
5238609 5241028 No, but he... he...
5241112 5243239 Has Daniel ever wandered off<br />like this before?
5243322 5245158 Never. Not like this.
5247994 5250496 Oh, my God! Mom! Oh!
5252206 5253833 Your eye. Are you okay?
5253916 5255626 I'm all right, darling.<br />I'm all right.
5255710 5257837 Oh, we were so worried<br />about you!
5258337 5259630 Ah!
5271225 5272351 You drove.
5273269 5274269 I did.
5276063 5277940 You went back to the buffet.
5282403 5283403 I did.
5283446 5285323 What happened?
5285406 5287408 Well, I'll tell you everything,
5287492 5289243 but there's something<br />I'd like to do first,
5289327 5290828 if you would indulge me.
5290912 5291913 Of course!
5292747 5295416 I'm just Annie,<br />Mr. Warbucks, sir.
5295500 5297794 I'm sorry I'm not a... a boy.
5297877 5300046 It's her first night here, sir.
5300129 5303216 Well, Annie, how would you<br />like to go to a movie?
5304509 5307678 And then you could go<br />to The Roxy
5307762 5313601 and then some ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's,
5313684 5317605 and then a cab ride<br />around Central Park.
5322360 5323653 Um, well...
5325696 5326739 Yeah, wow.
5327532 5330576 Golly. Golly, Daddy,<br />Mr. Warbucks.
5331828 5333955 It's a strange show!
5389802 5391554 I'm glad to come here.
5393848 5395516 These are good graves.
5396893 5398102 Do you like them?
5398185 5399437 Yeah. As in, what?
5399520 5400813 Do I want to be buried in them?
5400897 5403482 I got a ton of graves.
5403566 5404984 Oh, yeah?
5405776 5407278 Beautiful graves.
5408154 5409238 Some here.
5410406 5412325 Mostly back in New York.
5413159 5417288 Uh, does Allie plan on being<br />buried in a Jewish cemetery?
5417371 5418623 Oh, I don't know, you know?
5418706 5421000 We haven't really had<br />the graves conversation yet.
5421083 5422376 Taking it slow.
5423502 5425338 Oh, we may have enough.
5429717 5431302 You get very greedy.
5432720 5434597 You want to see<br />what's gonna happen
5434680 5435973 to those you love.
5441145 5442271 I love you.
5443272 5446692 And if you ever do die,
5446776 5448486 I'm really, really, really<br />gonna miss you.
5448569 5451530 And I know you know that,<br />but I just, uh...
5452198 5455785 I wanted to say that<br />while we're here.
5456619 5457662 While we're here.
5461540 5463084 Wherever I go...
5464877 5466879 I'm not gonna worry about you.
5469173 5471175 You're gonna be okay, Danny.
5490444 5494657 Look... look at the bottoms<br />of those trees.
5494740 5497785 I mean, look how gnarled<br />they are, and yet they live.
5497868 5499203 - Look.<br />- I'm looking.
5499286 5500286 You should be taking
5500329 5501580 photographs of this.
5501664 5503499 Is this unbelievable?
5503582 5504667 It's incredible.
