28395 30796 Thelma: <i>I need the, uh...</i><br /><i>Oh, where is it?</i>
30798 32330 Daniel: <i>Where's the...</i><br /><i>where's the what?</i>
32332 33766 Thelma: <i>Yeah,</i><br /><i>this thing has gone nuts.</i>

35235 38169 I can't... (clicks tongue)<br />Oh, shit. I give...
38171 39639 Daniel:<br />What are you looking for?
39641 41406 Thelma: Bobby's email.
41408 43110 Oh. Scroll down.
46179 47847 I'm scrolling.
48048 49347 Daniel:<br /><i>No, you're not scrolling.</i>
49349 50382 - <i>Look.</i><br />- Thelma: <i>Oh.</i>
50384 52150 Look, this is scrolling.
52152 53820 Thelma: Okay.
56156 57255 - Thelma: <i>No, wait.</i><br />- Daniel: <i>What?</i>
57257 59457 - Thelma: Wait. Wait. Wait.<br />- Daniel: What? What?
59459 62129 What... The...<br />Stop fussing with it.
62797 63863 What's this?
63865 66666 Daniel: <i>This is an ad</i><br /><i>for Neiman Marcus.</i>
66668 67934 Get rid of it.
67936 70603 You don't have to trash it.<br />Could just stay in your inbox.
70605 72470 Thelma:<br />Yeah, but who needs it?
72472 74139 <i>What's an inbox?</i>
74141 76609 It's where, um, where<br />all your emails are stored.
76611 78310 It's like a big folder
78312 80880 on your computer<br />with all of the emails.
83150 84550 Thelma: <i>What's a computer?</i>
84552 85785 (chuckles)
85787 88588 - This is a computer.<br />- (laughs)
88590 91356 I know this is a computer,<br />but what is it really?
91358 92725 How does it function?
92727 95160 Daniel: <i>It's, um...</i>

96496 99333 (both chuckle)

138873 140506 It's not a stuntman?
140508 143377 No, that's the whole thing.<br />He does it all himself.
144444 146746 - Thelma: Wow.<br />- Daniel: That's Cruise.
146748 148848 Thelma: Terrific.
148950 153154 - You got big plans tonight?<br />- Nah, just dinging around.
154254 156122 You spoken to Allie?
156124 157322 We're still on a break.
157324 160526 I'm just, you know, trying<br />to give her a little space,
160528 163228 and... I'm just not<br />really sure
163230 164462 what my selling points are<br />at the moment.
164464 165296 - (chuckles)<br />- Thelma: Oh,
165298 167767 well, you're<br />a wonderful grandson.
167769 170736 You know computers.<br />You have your hair.
170738 172470 I think it's gonna start<br />to go early.
172472 174239 Well, you can't<br />get hung up on that.
174241 177308 Yeah. We're just in different<br />places as people, you know?
177310 179280 She... she thinks I'm stuck.
179947 182249 You're too young to be stuck.
182650 184285 Daniel: I don't feel young.
184351 186317 Well, I don't feel old.
186319 187987 - Oy.<br />- "Oy" is right.
187989 189889 (both chuckle)
189924 193859 You're gonna land<br />on your feet. Like Cruise.
193861 195828 (thrilling music continues)
195830 198531 Thelma: Who is it they say<br />lands on their feet?
198533 199565 I think cats.
199567 200566 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
200568 202601 But I guess in a way,<br />it could be about both.
202603 203836 Mm.
203838 205705 Do you want this?
205707 208507 It's a marble.<br />I got a ton of these.
208509 209842 Sure.
209844 212511 How about some pretzels?<br />I got a ton of pretzels.
212513 213746 Only if, yeah,<br />you don't need them.
213748 215514 Thelma: No, I can't chew them.
215516 217983 Well... Could you please<br />just wear this when I go?
217985 219985 - Ugh, I'm fine.<br />- I know you are.
219987 221053 You... you...<br />you probably won't need it,
221055 223321 but I'll just feel better<br />if you wear it, okay?
223323 224623 What's the point?
224625 226559 - If I fall, I'm toast.<br />- Daniel: Come on.
226561 227960 Thelma: That's why<br />I don't fall.
227962 229896 Daniel: Don't say that,<br />please.
229997 232263 - For my mental health?<br />- (Thelma grunting)
232265 234235 (exhales) Okay.
234367 236836 - For my guardian angel.<br />- Thank you.

624892 626725 and it was worse<br />than you think.
626727 630295 - And she was pregnant and...<br />- I hit a pregnant woman?

631465 632498 Oh, no, no, no,
632500 634133 - it was a car accident.<br />- No, yeah, this was all
634135 635234 - happening inside of a car.<br />- Oh.
635236 636468 Okay, well, that...<br />Yeah, that makes more sense.
636470 638770 Well, what are you<br />talking about?
638772 640839 No, I misunderstood.<br />(chuckles)
640841 642441 Why weren't you picking up<br />your phone?
642443 643475 I was asleep.
643477 645777 At 10:30?<br />I called you at 10:30.
645779 646912 And then... and then...
646914 648480 Yeah, but I went out<br />last night with some friends.
648482 650949 - You didn't drive, did you?<br />- Um...
650951 654086 Did you get drunk? You know,<br />alcohol is a major depressant.
654088 655954 It's... Wendy Horowitz's son
655956 657222 is completely hooked<br />on Don Julio.
657224 659758 - Don Julio.<br />- He's... He can't hold a job.
659760 661126 He's in and out of rehabs.
661128 663262 He's...<br />Has no sense of agency.
663264 664930 - Alan: And he vapes.<br />- Gail: He vapes.
664932 667766 He's completely lost,<br />and he may never find himself.
667768 670769 - Are you paying attention?<br />- Yes, I understand.
670771 671870 Do you?
671872 673573 Yeah. I mean,<br />it's... it's an issue.
673575 676842 Mom, did you really think<br />it was Daniel?
676844 678443 I mean, how did you think<br />this was real?
678445 680312 Mom, you thought<br />it was real, too.
680314 681947 Well, she was very convincing.
681949 683315 Well, she was scared,<br />your mother.
683317 684950 - I was sc...<br />- We were all scared.
684952 687319 I wasn't quite as scared,<br />just for the record.
687321 690189 We'll see what happens<br />when you get a call, buddy.
690191 693425 I wouldn't be fooled.<br />My mind is sharp as a tack.
693427 694628 What?
694663 697330 I said I wouldn't be fooled.<br />My mind is sharp as a tack.
697599 700032 - What's he saying?<br />- He's making a joke.
700034 701466 - Oh.<br />- You want to try it again?
701468 703101 - What's the joke, Alan?<br />- Never mind.
703103 704537 - Never mind.<br />- Gail: It wasn't a joke.
704539 706071 - Never mind.<br />- Well, you know,
706073 707708 it was a close call, but...
708475 709775 it's over now.
709777 711411 Everything's okay.
712246 713912 I am so embarrassed.
713914 715447 - No.<br />- Don't be. You're home.
715449 717584 You're safe.<br />That's all that matters.
717985 719786 But I sent the money.
721523 723290 Oh.
727962 729529 You're speeding, Danny.
731799 733465 Well, we could report<br />a tracking number
733467 736235 if it's with Western Union,<br />FedEx, UPS.
736237 738003 With a letter,<br />our only real option
738005 739104 is to contact<br />the postal service,
739106 741873 and with these types<br />of things, the odds are slim,
741875 743175 especially without<br />the address.
743177 744910 I think I have it here.
744912 746546 Such a mean thing to do.<br />It's just sick!
746548 748080 Alan: Isn't there anything<br />that can be done?
748082 749414 A database of some kind?
749416 751450 We have no moral center<br />as a society.
751452 753653 This is a systemic issue.
753655 755821 - You have it?<br />- I don't have it.
755823 757322 Detective Morgan:<br />If it's any comfort,
757324 759358 these kinds of scams<br />are increasingly common.
759360 762060 Well, how do they know<br />who I am?
762062 764863 They contact people at random<br />using telephone listings
764865 767734 - and social networking sites.<br />- Like Facebook?
767736 769101 Sure. Like Facebook.
769103 772506 Well, how can Zuckemborg<br />let this happen?
772840 773805 Sorry?
773807 776910 Shouldn't Zuckemborg<br />be able to fix this?
777278 778845 Are you on Facebook?
778879 780580 - Am I?<br />- No you're not. She's not.
780582 782314 - Uh, this was a tangent.<br />- (softly) No.
782316 784216 Detective Morgan: I would<br />suggest canceling your cards
784218 786118 and freezing your accounts<br />until you're sure
786120 787319 you didn't provide<br />any information
787321 789855 that can leave the door open<br />to more fraud.
789857 792457 Beyond that, there's not much<br />we can do at this point.
792459 793960 Alan: Hmm.
795095 796530 Detective Morgan: Sorry.
796997 798130 No, you're not.
798132 800232 (pensive music playing)
800234 802036 Daniel: You want a blanket?
803037 805304 Or, um, water or anything?
805306 809076 No, I'll just close my eyes<br />for a minute.
812012 813546 Gail: She gets confused.
813548 815515 - Daniel: Not really.<br />- Gail: It's more than before.
815517 817416 Daniel: I haven't noticed<br />that big of a difference.
817418 819017 Little things, maybe.
819019 820419 Gail: She's gotten<br />these calls before.
820421 822187 We may be entering<br />a new phase.
822189 824423 What? What do you mean...<br />(chuckles) ...a new phase?
824425 827926 Now may be the time<br />where we really consider
827928 830362 whether or not living alone<br />is the best option.
830364 832732 - You think we're there?<br />- Gail: We're considering it.
832734 834833 I lost my wallet last week.
834835 838270 I don't think that was a sign<br />of my mind deteriorating.
838272 839905 No, that's a lack of presence,<br />sweetheart.
839907 841106 Did you order<br />a replacement license?
841108 842341 Yeah, yeah. I did.
842343 843909 Good, 'cause you don't want<br />to be driving without that.
843911 845077 You could end up<br />in a database.
845079 847446 Why are you obsessed with<br />databases all of a sudden?
847448 848914 You don't want<br />to end up in one.
848916 850817 Okay, well,<br />I just think that...
850984 853753 this can be handled.<br />Maybe I can handle it.
853755 854886 Alan: What are you proposing?
854888 857422 Daniel: I will come over more,<br />I'll call every day,
857424 859224 and I'll make sure that<br />she keeps her Lyfe Line on.
859226 860593 Oh, my God,<br />I didn't tell you this.
860595 862762 Susan's mother fell<br />into a fire pit.
862764 863629 Completely died.
863631 866031 What?<br />Why are we talking about this?
866033 868100 Well, because things happen<br />to people as they age.
868102 870001 Weird, crazy things like that.
870003 871336 - Was it on?<br />- I didn't ask.
871338 872638 I assumed it was.
872640 874406 Alan: This wouldn't have<br />happened a year ago.
874408 876308 She's not as self-reliant<br />as she was.
876310 879411 Gail: We can't just keep doing<br />what we're doing. She's 93.
879413 881179 Alan: Maybe it's time<br />for assisted living.
881181 884618 - (hearing aids whir)<br />- (sound fades)
893193 894660 Daniel: <i>You sure</i><br /><i>I can't stay over?</i>
894662 896128 Oh, no. No, no.
896130 898099 - I've got things to do.<br />- Okay.
900000 901968 - (Thelma groans)<br />- Yeah.
904639 908142 - For my mental health.<br />- (Thelma sighs)
909410 911978 (music fades)
921021 923556 (Thelma sighing)
924692 926993 Thelma: (voice breaking)<br />Aw, Teddy.
928530 930797 I made a mistake.
937204 938738 (sobs softly)
939206 941708 (birds chirping)
957692 961828 (clock ticking)

973207 976609 (thrilling music playing)
981716 983250 (hearing aid beeps)
997164 998965 (dog barks)
1014682 1017583 - Thelma: Uh, hi.<br />- Hello.
1017585 1019417 Thelma: Do we know each other?
1019419 1021521 - (music calms)<br />- I'm not sure.
1021523 1024256 Thelma: (sighs) You...<br />you look so familiar.
1024258 1026826 (chuckling)<br />Do you know Judy? Judy Miller?
1027227 1029261 I don't think so.
1029263 1032230 Do you know Ellen?<br />Ellen Marcus?
1032232 1034701 No, I don't think so.
1034969 1038136 - Well, have a nice day.<br />- Bye, now.
1038138 1040174 (music intensifies)
1049817 1051182 (exhales)
1051184 1053351 (music fades)

1063263 1064697 (laptop chimes)
1066868 1068802 (cellphone vibrating)
1070772 1071904 Hi.
1071906 1075508 - I... I found the address.<br />- What? What address?
1075510 1076742 Thelma: <i>From the scam.</i>
1076744 1079311 It was this tiny slip<br />of paper. (chuckles)
1079313 1081379 You'll never guess<br />where I found it.
1081381 1083315 - Grandma, I'm sorry,<br />it's going...<br />- Thelma: <i>It was...</i>
1083317 1084482 - ...in and out.<br /><i>- ...trash can...</i>
1084484 1085383 I can't hear you that well.
1085385 1088020 ...in the bathroom<br />at the post office.
1088022 1090590 Wait, you went<br />to the post office?
1090592 1091456 Yeah.
1091458 1092825 Daniel:<br /><i>Well, how did you get there?</i>
1092827 1094259 Well, I walked.
1094261 1095561 Grandma. (chuckles)
1095563 1097429 That's far.<br />You should not have done that.
1097431 1099364 Well, it's a few blocks.
1099366 1103670 Y... you can't... You need<br />to tell me if you're gonna...
1104171 1107238 go somewhere,<br />so that I can take you, okay?
1107240 1108406 Thelma: <i>What?</i>
1108408 1112879 You... you should not have<br />gone that far on your own.
1112947 1115313 But I found it.<br />I have it here.
1115315 1116281 Daniel: <i>I know.</i>
1116283 1119384 Maybe it's better<br />to just pause for now
1119386 1123357 and we can<br />figure it out together. Okay?
1123625 1124824 What about my money?
1124826 1127258 Am I supposed to just<br />let them have it?
1127260 1128761 Well, but the odds<br />of getting it back
1128763 1130328 are pretty slim, right?
1130330 1131496 I mean,<br />the most important thing
1131498 1134934 is that you don't overdo it,<br />that... that you're safe.
1135369 1137171 <i>I'm sorry about the money,</i>
1137204 1140640 <i>but it... it could</i><br /><i>have been a lot worse.</i>
1140875 1142842 Are you okay?<br />You're at home now?
1142844 1144376 Yeah, I'm at home.
1144378 1145645 Daniel: <i>Oh, great.</i>
1145647 1149280 <i>You need to go anywhere,</i><br /><i>just tell me. I can take you.</i>
1149282 1153284 Okay, darling.<br />I appreciate that. Speak soon.
1153286 1155389 - Love you. Oh.<br />- (line beeps)
1158593 1162595 Cynthia, I... I'm afraid<br />I need a bit of a favor.
1162597 1166267 Uh, it's an odd situation,<br />and... uh...
1166333 1170235 Oh, Sara.<br />I thought you were Cynthia.
1170237 1174640 She did? How awful.<br />Oh, Sara, I'm so sorry.
1174642 1178711 No, no, no. Never mind.<br />Forget I called. All is well.
1178713 1181514 Hello? Is Harvin there?
1181516 1182581 (intriguing music playing)
1182583 1184185 Well, what happened?
1184217 1187687 Oh, a stroke.<br />Oh, I am so sorry, Joan.
1187689 1189487 A heart attack?
1189489 1190623 Sepsis?
1190625 1194593 He moved to Cleveland?<br />Well, when did this happen?
1194595 1197429 Oh, God,<br />I called Cynthia again.
1197431 1201868 Sara, it was a mistake.<br />I know she's dead. Thank you.
1212647 1218452 (clock ticking)
1219587 1222156 (thrilling music playing)
1222389 1225256 (line ringing)
1225258 1228329 Danny, I need a ride.
1228963 1231864 Just to get this<br />out of the way up top,
1231866 1235102 you were not at home.
1238539 1240472 All my friends are dead.
1240474 1243441 What? Don't say that.
1243443 1246011 Well, it's true.<br />They're all popping off.
1246013 1249682 I used to be<br />in four lunch groups.
1249684 1252019 Who's left? Judith?
1252053 1255020 She can't hear anything,<br />and she's a hunchback now.
1255022 1257990 I wouldn't want to have<br />lunch with her alone.
1257992 1261961 Herman's in Canada.<br />Mona doesn't leave the house.
1261963 1264329 I could ask Lee Horner<br />to join us,
1264331 1266031 but I don't have her number.
1266033 1268466 And Ruth burned up<br />in a fire pit.
1268468 1270903 I heard that. I'm sorry.
1272740 1275376 I didn't expect to get so old.
1275910 1277344 Well...
1278012 1279812 I'm glad you did.
1281783 1283015 Who do you know here, again?
1283017 1286619 You remember Ben. Ben Halpern?<br />He was married to Sheryl.
1286621 1287686 Oh, yeah.
1287688 1290122 Yeah, you guys used to see<br />each other all the time.
1290124 1293726 I always found him,<br />I don't know, s... s... soft.
1293728 1296361 - Soft?<br />- I... I don't know. Fussy.
1296363 1297564 Oh.
1298465 1300367 Thelma: Sheryl's dead, too.
1300500 1303903 She fell down some stairs<br />in their house.
1304272 1307039 She was there for hours<br />before they found her.
1307041 1308406 Poor thing.
1308408 1309909 I remember.
1310511 1312745 (grunts) This car is filthy.
1312747 1314880 I'm taking good care of it.<br />I'm gonna clean it.
1314882 1317783 Oh, you don't clean it.<br />Who raised you?
1317785 1318818 Your daughter.
1318820 1321053 This is your father's<br />influence.
1321055 1323522 There are coins<br />all over the floor.
1323524 1326926 They fall out of his pockets<br />'cause he's got no waist.
1326928 1329962 Every time I ride with him,<br />I make five bucks.
1329964 1335002 (intriguing music playing)
1341042 1343142 (engine shuts off)
1343144 1346444 - Want me to come in?<br />- Oh, I'm just saying hello.
1346446 1349350 I won't be long.<br />Thirty minutes.
1349851 1351851 Daniel: If you need anything,<br />I'll be here.
1351853 1353451 - Thelma: Okay.<br />- (Daniel chuckles)
1353453 1354854 (car door closing)
1382617 1385052 (cardiac monitor beeping)
1392660 1396497 (upbeat music playing<br />over speaker)
1421822 1424256 Ben: Then you'll go<br />to the Roxy
1424258 1427927 and then an ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's
1427929 1432199 and then a hansom cab ride<br />around Central Park.
1432867 1435034 Gloria, that's your cue.
1435036 1437636 Oh, all right.<br />And what do I say?
1437638 1439104 Director: "Golly."
1439106 1443142 All right. Okay. You know.<br />Golly!
1443144 1445077 Director:<br />Just "golly." Just the line.
1445079 1446111 Gloria: I did, didn't I? Yes?
1446113 1447146 Director:<br />Uh, not... not quite.
1447148 1449081 Gloria: We went through that,<br />and I said...
1449083 1451016 Director: Why don't we<br />go back to hansom cab,
1451018 1453285 and then grab golly?
1453287 1456256 Ah, it is good<br />to see you, Thel.
1456357 1459525 - You look terrific.<br />- Ah, I'm a balloon.
1459527 1460559 (both chuckle)
1460561 1462728 Well, what's with this?<br />Are you doing a play?
1462730 1466165 Yes. <i>Annie.</i><br />I got Daddy Warbucks.
1466167 1469668 - Well, that's a big role.<br />- Yeah, I wasn't expecting it.
1469670 1471236 I thought I'd be part<br />of the chorus
1471238 1473238 - or maybe Mr. Bundles.<br />- (chuckles)
1473240 1476210 We open tonight,<br />but Miss Hannigan...
1476744 1478278 she's senile,
1478379 1480646 and we got a lady<br />playing Roosevelt
1480648 1482548 because there's never<br />enough boys.
1482550 1486318 And Gloria, that's Annie,<br />she's a total amateur.
1486320 1490424 I'm going to have to bring<br />a lot of pizzazz.
1490691 1493525 You know,<br />I think about Teddy often.
1493527 1495529 What a special guy.
1495563 1498030 Uh, how long has it been?<br />Two years now?
1498032 1501268 - Just about two.<br />- Yeah, five for my Sheryl.
1501836 1504271 It feels like a dream.
1506140 1508941 - How are you holding up?<br />- Let's not be maudlin.
1508943 1510642 You going to show me<br />your place?
1510644 1512479 Oh, oh, sure, sure. Come on.
1512747 1514748 Got a TV.
1515716 1517484 Window. Plants.
1517952 1519386 Do you mind?
1520888 1523457 Infection starts<br />from the hands.
1523891 1526325 Director is trying to get me<br />to touch Gloria
1526327 1528160 in that scene<br />where I adopt her,
1528162 1530796 but I'm not going to do it.<br />It's not worth it.
1530798 1532798 If it makes it worse,<br />so be it.
1532800 1535102 It's not like<br />we're being reviewed.
1535536 1539571 Oh, this is Gary.<br />We call him Starey Gary.
1539573 1541240 It's not an insult.
1541242 1543176 It's just something<br />that happens.
1543644 1545377 I don't think he minds.
1545379 1547379 Everybody does it.<br />Not just me.
1547381 1549081 Everybody calls him that.
1549083 1550349 (intriguing music playing)
1550351 1553819 Ah. Isn't she a beauty?
1553821 1557056 Three wheels,<br />43 miles per charge,
1557058 1559124 and bright red,<br />so you can see me coming.
1559126 1561794 And a little basket<br />for whatever you need.
1561796 1563395 I like to put bread in there.
1563397 1566632 Not... not a whole bread<br />but just little pieces.
1566634 1568133 You put them in loose?
1568135 1571103 No, no, no.<br />In... in bags. Ziploc.
1571105 1573340 You think I could borrow it?
1574175 1575574 Borrow my scooter?
1575576 1577277 Well, I...
1578379 1580279 I'm in a bit of a situation.
1580281 1584316 - What?<br />- I'm in a bit of a situation.
1584318 1586051 It's... (exhales)
1586053 1589423 Oh, it's a headache.<br />The less you know, the better.
1589623 1593126 Well, if it involves<br />my scooter, it involves me.
1593360 1596396 I... I don't want to say<br />in front of Gary.
1597198 1600133 Uh, Gary, can you<br />give us a second?
1600835 1602434 Thelma: Is he going to listen?
1602436 1605539 I'm not sure,<br />but he's going to watch.
1606707 1608207 Have you got a telephone?
1608209 1609676 Yes.
1610277 1611745 (cellphone beeps)
1614381 1616817 Automated Voice:<br /><i>Microphone enabled.</i>
1619220 1621488 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
1622356 1624558 (whispering over hearing aids)<br /><i>I got scammed,</i>
1624658 1628093 <i>but I have the address</i><br /><i>where I sent the money.</i>
1628095 1634867 <i>It's a PO Box in Van Nuys.</i><br /><i>1534 San Fernando Road.</i>
1634869 1637236 <i>I'm on my way there now.</i>
1637238 1641308 <i>I'm going to try to figure out</i><br /><i>who took it and get it back.</i>
1644845 1646647 <i>What are you, nuts?</i>
1646714 1649348 <i>That's absurd.</i><br /><i>You got to tell the police.</i>
1649350 1653487 <i>- Oh, they're no use.</i><br /><i>- What about your family?</i>
1653787 1657723 <i>- Not with this.</i><br /><i>- It's a bad idea.</i>
1657725 1659526 <i>But you have a better one?</i>

1663230 1666767 <i>At least you have your health.</i><br /><i>Be grateful for that.</i>
1682349 1685552 Listen, why don't you stay<br />for lunch?
1685719 1691291 We have a beautiful cafeteria<br />and wonderful melons. Fresh.
1691392 1692793 Sure.
1694495 1697062 D... do you think<br />I could try it out?
1697064 1699800 I... I may be in the market<br />for one.
1700467 1701333 (scooter beeps)
1701335 1705706 I love driving. (chuckles)<br />I miss it.

1739106 1741173 Winston, can I borrow<br />your scooter?
1741175 1744578 Winston. Ah, I'm taking it.
1750884 1752484 Uh, are you talking to me?
1752486 1754521 (tires screech)
1757992 1760359 - Ben: Thel.<br />- Son of a bitch.

1849283 1852317 - Let's just talk.<br />- Everybody wants to talk.
1852319 1855420 My God.<br />I just needed your scooter.
1855422 1858358 Please be a doll<br />and don't make a fuss.
1859259 1861393 My grandson's<br />parked a block away.
1861395 1862961 I don't have much time.
1862963 1864429 You left your grandson<br />in the car?
1864431 1866365 Well, he's 24.
1866367 1869067 (exhales) Please don't make me<br />go through you, Ben.
1869069 1870603 No, you couldn't.
1870605 1872337 I got a titanium hip.
1872339 1874574 Thelma: Well, should we<br />put that to the test?
1874576 1877409 I'm going,<br />with or without you.
1877411 1880914 I'm not going to let you<br />go alone. I won't.
1883618 1885852 (timer ringing)
1887154 1889823 (intriguing music playing)
1890391 1893526 Hi. Um, I'm looking<br />for my grandma.
1893528 1895293 Thelma Post. White hair.
1895295 1896729 A little wobbly.<br />Very determined.
1896731 1899097 - (chuckling) Okay.<br />- She's not... she's not...
1899099 1900600 She doesn't live here,<br />but she's visiting a friend.
1900602 1902334 She would have come in<br />like 30 minutes ago.
1902336 1904069 Huh.<br />So, I'm not seeing her here.
1904071 1906473 - Okay.<br />- But...
1908743 1910643 - Grandma?<br />- Resident 1: Hello?
1910645 1912144 Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry.
1912146 1914647 Uh, I'm just looking<br />for my grandma. Sorry.
1914649 1916114 - Resident 2: Hello?<br />- Hi, there.
1916116 1917617 - You took my scooter?<br />- What? No.
1917619 1920185 You sound like the man<br />who took my scooter.
1920187 1922588 I didn't take... I promise,<br />I... I... No, I'm...
1922590 1924657 You're getting me nervous.<br />You're getting me nervous.
1924659 1925625 Sorry. I'm gonna go.
1925627 1926726 - Yeah, go.<br />- Uh, good luck.
1926728 1927760 What do you mean, "Good luck?"
1927762 1930197 If you took my scooter,<br />don't tell me good luck.
1931298 1933633 Do you know Ben? Uh...
1934067 1936037 Uh, Halpern, I believe?
1939273 1941741 Mom, uh, we may have<br />a little situation here.
1941743 1944276 No, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.<br />No, I'm not in jail.
1944278 1946913 No. Um, it's Grandma.
1952520 1954386 I got to be back by 8:00.
1954388 1956488 It's opening night,<br />and I don't want to miss it.
1956490 1958190 I got it. I got it.
1958192 1961928 (adventurous music playing)
1971138 1972738 Daniel:<br /><i>Mom, I checked every room.</i>
1972740 1974072 <i>She's not answering her phone,</i>
1974074 1976709 <i>but she should</i><br /><i>have her Lyfe Line on.</i>
1976711 1979244 So has she ever<br />wandered off before?
1979246 1980546 Never. Not like this.
1980548 1982447 One time, I thought I lost her<br />at Souplantation,
1982449 1985083 but she was just going back<br />for, uh, little pizzas.
1985085 1986318 Souplantation.
1986320 1988821 It was a buffet restaurant.<br />You could go back for more.
1988823 1992424 I can't believe it was<br />actually called Souplantation.
1992426 1994326 - I never processed that.<br />- Alan: Oh, wow.
1994328 1995427 Gail: Well, it had things<br />she could chew.
1995429 1996562 Alan: She can't chew anything.
1996564 1998196 She can chew some things,<br />Alan.
1998198 1999397 It's, like...<br />It's confusing, you know,
1999399 2000398 what she can and can't chew.
2000400 2004102 Like, she can't have a salad,<br />but she can...
2004104 2005638 Like, last week,<br />she ate a cashew.
2005640 2007272 So she hasn't<br />wandered off before?
2007274 2010211 Except to a salad bar?<br />By choice?
2010244 2011844 - Exactly. Right?<br />- Yeah.
2011846 2014079 Well, um, I don't want<br />to alarm you guys,
2014081 2016381 but one of our residents<br />is missing.
2016383 2018618 - Alan: Oh.<br />- Um, yeah. Ben Halpern.
2018620 2019819 - Oh, Ben.<br />- Yeah, she, she um...
2019821 2021253 Rochelle:<br />Are the two of them involved?
2021255 2023856 No. No. They're...<br />they're not even...
2023858 2025992 She doesn't even really<br />like him all that much.
2025994 2027660 Oh, so is there bad blood?
2027662 2029361 - What are you insinuating?<br />- Rochelle: Nothing.
2029363 2030395 No, no, no. Not like that.
2030397 2032163 We're just... we're just<br />trying to understand.
2032165 2033900 You know he has<br />a show tonight.
2033902 2035635 How would we know that?
2035637 2036736 Gail: Well, does his family...
2036738 2038771 Have you notified<br />his family that he's missing?
2038773 2040640 He doesn't have any family.
2040642 2042107 - So, no.<br />- Oh.
2042109 2043441 Aww.
2043443 2045110 Well, what can<br />we be doing here?
2045112 2047345 Can you guys send out<br />some kind of senior alert?
2047347 2049147 - A Silver Alert?<br />- A Silver Alert.
2049149 2050415 - Rochelle: No.<br />- Colin: No.
2050417 2052183 We are not authorized<br />to do that.
2052185 2053819 The police have to declare her
2053821 2055353 - a missing person.<br />- A missing person.
2055355 2057422 But she is a missing person.
2057424 2059525 - Don't you have somebody...<br />- We don't know where she is.
2059527 2061561 - It's only been an hour,<br />right?<br />- Yeah, just one hour.
2061563 2063829 Right,<br />it hasn't been that long.
2063831 2065096 Yeah,<br />curtain's not until 8:00.
2065098 2066832 - What's the show?<br />- You're still talking<br />about the show?
2066834 2068166 <i>- Annie.</i><br /><i>- Annie.</i>
2068168 2069401 - Oh, that's a good one.<br />- Oh.
2069403 2072237 So, uh, does Thelma have any<br />specific medical conditions
2072239 2073471 that we should know about?
2073473 2076241 She's had breast cancer,<br />double mastectomy,
2076243 2078376 sepsis, edema,
2078378 2080813 valve replacement,<br />hip replacement,
2080815 2082615 arrhythmia, brain tumor.
2082617 2084550 I think she actually has<br />a brain tumor right now.
2084552 2087152 - Yeah, the doctor said it was<br />growing slowly...<br />- That's right. Yeah.
2087154 2088888 - ...so they could just<br />leave it in there.<br />- She has a brain tumor.
2088890 2090723 So, all of that and<br />a brain tumor at the moment.
2090725 2092226 Yeah.
2092627 2094492 Wow, uh, thank you.
2094494 2096796 Thank you so much<br />for telling us all of that.
2096798 2098496 And she had the TGA, right?
2098498 2101266 - TGA?<br />- Transient global amnesia.
2101268 2102902 Yeah, it was about a year ago.
2102904 2105571 And, um, she just...<br />she got very disoriented.
2105573 2107540 She didn't know who she was.<br />She didn't know who we were.
2107542 2109809 Lasted only just about<br />an hour.
2109978 2112146 But it was...<br />it was unsettling.
2113514 2116082 But she's a tough cookie.
2116084 2118316 Obviously, we want help<br />finding her.
2118318 2122187 It's just,<br />it might still be a, you know,
2122189 2125958 "going back to the buffet"<br />type of situation, I think.
2125960 2130197 Well, the good news is,<br />they rarely go far.
2130230 2135035 (thrilling music playing)
2156791 2158557 Ben: Uh, Thel,<br />why does this street look
2158559 2159859 so familiar to me?
2159861 2161694 Thelma:<br />We're stopping at Mona's.
2161696 2165131 Oh, I haven't seen Mona<br />since Berlin.
2165133 2167733 That was a fun trip,<br />wasn't it?
2167735 2169802 What year was it? '95?
2169804 2172270 Um, '98, I think.
2172272 2175742 Ah, it was a bumpy flight,<br />but otherwise it was terrific.
2176744 2179945 You know Mona<br />is obsessed with me.
2179947 2181580 We... we never acted on it,
2181582 2183549 but she would always stare<br />at my legs
2183551 2185383 whenever I had short pants on.
2185385 2187953 (chuckles)<br />Whatever you say, buddy.
2187955 2191258 Now, if you're right,<br />maybe we could use it.
2192426 2194325 Why are we stopping at Mona's?
2194327 2195561 To get a gun.
2195563 2198731 Oh, my God.<br />What do we need a gun for?
2198733 2200331 Thelma:<br />It's just a precaution.
2200333 2203536 Couple of schmegegges like us<br />turning up unannounced?
2203538 2205270 I like to be prepared.
2205272 2207039 Do you even know<br />how to use it?
2207041 2211011 Well, how hard can it be?<br />Idiots use them all the time.
2211646 2214245 You're going to have<br />to distract her.
2214247 2215948 She's still sharp.
2215950 2218283 This is not going to be<br />so easy.
2218285 2220418 Maybe I could do my monologue.
2220420 2222387 I'd rather you didn't.
2222389 2226126 (suspenseful music playing)
2226493 2228062 (tires screech)
2241709 2244844 - (birds chirping over TV)<br />- (door closing)
2250484 2251918 Mona?
2253487 2256756 Thel, darling.<br />Did we make a date?
2256758 2260126 Oh, no. No, no.<br />We were in the neighborhood.
2260128 2264630 - I would have put shoes on.<br />- (chuckles) Ben's here, too.
2264632 2266367 Good to see you, doll.
2267400 2271405 - Are you all right?<br />- Fine, fine.
2274509 2277643 Oh. Oh. Sit, dear.<br />Don't... don't clean.
2277645 2280147 Okay, okay.
2281481 2282615 (gasps)
2282617 2284550 - Is it a roach?<br />- (gasps)
2284552 2286652 Oh, you... you...<br />you got bugs?
2286654 2290589 I've been hunting 'em.<br />Can't seem to knock 'em off.
2290591 2292258 Oh, they're resilient.
2292260 2295561 That's why they make<br />worthy adversaries.
2295563 2298898 You get one, there are<br />ten more to replace him.
2298900 2301435 I've learned<br />to pick my battles.
2301903 2304305 So, uh, how are you?
2304572 2307139 - How's your health?<br />- I'm alive.
2307141 2309809 Ben: Oh, isn't that something?
2309811 2313547 - I got to use the bathroom.<br />- Oh, good, dear.
2315082 2317783 Um... (clicks tongue)
2317785 2321153 We were just talking<br />about Berlin. (chuckles)
2321155 2324425 (intriguing music playing)
2330865 2332266 (grunts softly)
2334101 2335433 (grunts)
2335435 2339370 Ben: We stayed<br />at that wonderful hotel.
2339372 2343742 The Kimch...<br />Kimpinchky? Kimsky?
2343744 2346213 Did we take a trip?
2348683 2351416 Um, that was a long time ago.
2351418 2353920 (stairs creak)
2355756 2357191 Oh.
2359026 2363197 Um, you know,<br />I'm over at Belwood now.
2363531 2367468 They have<br />the most wonderful melons.
2383483 2385185 (exhales)
2406473 2409508 - (bed squeaks)<br />- (grunts)
2409510 2411011 Cantaloupe.
2411846 2413547 Honeydew.
2414548 2416250 Jade dews.
2417484 2419084 - Berries.<br />- Berries?
2419086 2421921 Mm, yeah.<br />All kinds of berries.
2422489 2425557 Raspberries. Blueberries.
2425559 2428162 (bed rattles)
2429030 2430664 (gasps)
2440174 2441974 Ben: Blackberries.
2443277 2444743 Cherries.
2444745 2447247 (bed squeaks)
2451018 2452419 (grunts)
2452987 2455456 - (pants)<br />- (music stops)
2455589 2456989 - (gasps)<br />- (gunshot)
2456991 2459126 - (bullet ricocheting)<br />- (loud clang)
2460528 2462661 Uh, elderberries.
2462663 2465632 (thrilling music playing)
2468869 2473307 Annie, get your goddamn hound<br />out of my pool!
2473941 2476176 (music concludes)
2477645 2481482 Thel, did we make a date?
2481816 2484149 Oh, no, no, I...
2484151 2486218 I was just<br />in the neighborhood.
2486220 2489456 Mona:<br />I would have put my shoes on.
2490791 2494326 Well, I think it's time<br />we were on our way.
2494328 2497863 - You're leaving?<br />- I know, I know.
2497865 2499999 We'll have to get<br />a lunch on the books.
2500001 2501735 I'd like that.
2501836 2505237 (chuckles)<br />Can we get you anything?
2505239 2507606 I've got everything I need.
2507608 2512144 (melancholic music playing)
2512146 2513614 Goodbye, doll.
2527128 2530697 - (TV powering on)<br />- (birds chirping over TV)
2534001 2537471 (birds chirping)
2550317 2552352 (scooter beeps)
2554889 2559091 - Uh, she needs a charge.<br />- Oh.
2559093 2560492 (music fades)
2560494 2563163 I need to get IDs<br />from everyone.
2563197 2565299 Sure. Here.
2567168 2568669 Rochelle: Thank you.
2568803 2570737 (Daniel clicks tongue,<br />hesitates)
2571405 2572505 Can't find your wallet?
2572507 2575007 I... I, um... I have it.<br />I'm just not seeing my ID.
2575009 2576442 You're not even looking.<br />You're just patting.
2576444 2577676 Oh, yeah.
2577678 2580245 - Gail: Let me help.<br />- I, uh... Uh...
2580247 2582047 You didn't order<br />a replacement license.
2582049 2583348 - No, I did. I did.<br />- Alan: Don't lie.
2583350 2585384 - It's in there.<br />- Just tell us you didn't.
2585386 2587654 - I'd rather know<br />than be lied to.<br />- Daniel: It's...
2588389 2590155 I haven't, uh, yet.
2590157 2592157 - Gail: Why would you<br />keep this from us?<br />- Daniel: Becau...
2592159 2593692 Why would you keep this<br />from us?
2593694 2595027 - Daniel, that's really bad.<br />- Gail: This sucks.
2595029 2596428 But I'm... I'm gonna do it.
2596430 2598363 Can't drive without a license.<br />He can't drive<br />without a license.
2598365 2599998 I mean, he could,<br />but he... he shouldn't.
2600000 2601233 Daniel:<br />Okay, thank you, everyone.
2601235 2604236 You have to take care<br />of your vehicle, Daniel.
2604238 2605938 - Do you understand my...<br />- I understand.
2605940 2607439 This is the basics<br />of adult life.
2607441 2611345 Dad, please don't embarrass me<br />in front of...
2611946 2614113 Colin... (chuckling)<br />...and Rochelle.
2614115 2616483 We can give you guys a second.
2620354 2622721 (sighs)
2622723 2624823 Allie was very good for you<br />in that way.
2624825 2627392 She was very organized,
2627394 2630929 left-brained,<br />a grounding force.
2630931 2633198 Can we please not talk<br />about Allie?
2633200 2635701 (clicks tongue)<br />I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2635703 2637836 - Daniel: Thank you.<br />- Gail: I know it's hard.
2637838 2640641 I just don't like<br />to see you suffer like this.
2641408 2644209 - Makes me want to cry.<br />- What? No.
2644211 2646111 Gail: I do.<br />It makes me very sad.
2646113 2647880 - Daniel: It's okay.<br />- I have to cry.
2647882 2651318 - Alan: Okay.<br />- I just need to get it out.
2653053 2655188 Do you want us to...
2655723 2659291 sit with you and...<br />to get a replacement license?
2659293 2660659 Daniel: I... I can handle it.
2660661 2663128 - Let's just deal with one...<br />- I'm sorry.
2663130 2665499 ...family crisis<br />at a time, okay?
2671105 2675409 - (sighs)<br />- Chaim took this. My cousin.
2675943 2677409 Did you ever meet Chaim?
2677411 2679880 - No.<br />- From Hinsdale.
2680447 2681947 He's not doing so hot,
2681949 2683650 but this is<br />a beautiful picture.
2683652 2685184 (camera shutter clicks)
2685186 2687421 She shouldn't be living<br />like that.
2688222 2690290 She's managing.
2690391 2693058 Ben:<br />How is she getting her meals?
2693060 2696263 And when is the last time<br />she got out of that chair?
2696330 2697329 She's wasting away.
2697331 2701200 We all have our good days<br />and our bad days.
2701202 2703937 - And what's today?<br />- We'll find out.
2705540 2706905 (scoffs softly)
2706907 2708974 Gary's going to wonder<br />where I am.
2708976 2712211 What's with you?<br />Do you miss that place?
2712213 2715548 - I like that place.<br />- What's to like?
2715550 2719519 I swim twice a week.<br />There's wonderful classes...
2719521 2723121 cooking classes,<br />painting classes, Oopsy Upsy.
2723123 2725023 - Oopsy Upsy?<br />- Ben: Oopsy Upsy.
2725025 2727092 That's when a professional<br />comes in and shows us
2727094 2729294 how to pick each other up<br />after we fall.
2729296 2731964 There's a tub lift,<br />a shower lift,
2731966 2734399 and a dual lift<br />for when a couple falls.
2734401 2736168 Does that happen often?
2736170 2740172 Uh, not often, but it happens.<br />Usually on a hill.
2740174 2743875 You have to use each other's<br />weight as a counterbalance.
2743877 2745477 Sounds interesting.
2745479 2749016 (pensive music playing)
2749283 2753285 Sheryl used to cook,<br />pick up our socks,
2753287 2755522 keep the place together.
2756156 2758490 I'll take help<br />where I can get it.
2758492 2760594 I'm not ashamed.
2761028 2762829 It's not the same.
2763464 2764931 Ben: Why?
2764965 2767667 I always picked up the socks.
2773941 2775375 Hm.
2783618 2786251 - She posted!<br />- Gail: What?<br />She posted something?
2786253 2787252 - I think it...<br />- Gail: No.
2787254 2789054 Yeah, five minutes...<br />By accident, I think.
2789056 2790222 - Five minutes ago.<br />- Gail: Oh, my God.
2790224 2792424 - Look, look.<br />- Let's see.<br />Let's see. Let's see.
2792426 2793559 Do you recognize anything?
2793561 2795460 Gail: Make it bigger. Zoom in.<br />Can you enhance it?
2795462 2797095 Daniel: Enhancing.
2797097 2799965 I see gas pumps,<br />a blue car, a pigeon.
2799967 2801300 - No, two pigeons.<br />- This is Tujunga. Tujunga.
2801302 2803135 - Yeah, um...<br />- Alan: Isn't there<br />a gas station on Tujunga?
2803137 2804369 - Moorpark and Tujunga.<br />- Yes!
2804371 2805505 Daniel: Moorpark and Tujunga.
2805507 2807008 Alan:<br />And we're going, we're going.
2810144 2811611 Ah, damn.
2813013 2815782 (thrilling music playing)
2815883 2818350 Come on. We g...<br />We got to move.
2818352 2822856 Waze says 12 minutes<br />via Chandler and Colfax.
2825459 2827192 Thelma: Look at that.
2827194 2830564 Who created that?<br />Who thought it up?
2831265 2833398 A plug for a car.
2833400 2836937 Electricity goes through,<br />makes it run.
2837037 2840640 But what is electricity?<br />It boggles the mind.
2840642 2842409 (chuckles)
2842610 2845712 Oh, I think I know her.
2848215 2850516 - Can you go a little faster?<br />- Yes, thank you.
2850518 2853054 - God. Please.<br />- I'm going the speed limit.
2853120 2855789 We are a law-abiding family.
2860461 2862762 - (seat belt clicks)<br />- Huh.
2863130 2864965 Wants me to make a left.
2865399 2867533 This is why I don't use Waze.
2867535 2869602 It wants you to make<br />all these crazy turns.
2869604 2872505 Marci Wender's husband<br />was obsessed with Waze,
2872507 2875173 makes a psycho left,<br />ends up in Vons.
2875175 2875874 Estimates are<br />very accurate, Gail.
2875876 2877242 He paid thousands of dollars.
2877244 2878343 Alan: Very accurate.
2878345 2879211 - Gail: No they're not.<br />- Alan: It's been proven.
2879213 2881882 Thelma: Do you know Vi?<br />Vi Friedlander?
2881915 2884584 - Maybe through Saul.<br />- Thelma: Saul?
2884586 2888887 - Gary's kid. Gary Newman?<br />- No, I don't know them.
2888889 2894259 - Oh. Did you go to Sinai?<br />- No, we were at Beth Am.
2894261 2897129 You just look so terribly<br />familiar to me.
2897131 2898698 Just have to ignore<br />all your instincts
2898700 2899632 and trust the technology.
2899634 2902000 Technology is what got us<br />into this mess
2902002 2903503 in the first place!<br />Can you go back?
2903505 2904570 - (car horn honking)<br />- Alan: I can't go back.
2904572 2906371 - There's someone behind us.<br />- Alan: I see them!
2906373 2907507 - Daniel: So go!<br />- I can't go.
2907509 2908674 - There's a gap.<br />- There's a...
2908676 2910308 - There's a gap, Alan.<br />- Daniel: Take it!
2910310 2911511 Go, just go.
2911513 2914012 (all shouting indistinctly)
2914014 2915046 Daniel: Go. Yes, yes.
2915048 2917082 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.<br />- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
2917084 2918483 - (car horns honking)<br />- Okay, okay, okay.
2918485 2920753 - (shouting indistinctly)<br />- Ah!
2920755 2923990 - Yes, yes, I did.<br />- (Gail sighing)
2924526 2926626 And we're back to 12 minutes.
2927194 2928528 Gary Newman.
2928530 2931163 Ben: Oh, no.<br />My Gary is Rozelle.
2931165 2932598 Thelma:<br />Isn't that interesting?
2932600 2935233 Two different Garys,<br />but both Gary.
2935235 2937936 (music continues)
2937938 2941206 - How do you know each other?<br />- I guess we don't.
2941208 2943375 (sighs) It seemed possible.
2943377 2944677 - Alas.<br />- (chuckles)
2944679 2946311 Have a lovely day.
2946313 2951018 - You too.<br />- (chuckles, sighs)
2959627 2961695 - (Thelma gasps)<br />- Ben: What?
2963631 2965532 - What?<br />- Thelma: Oh.
2966366 2969203 - What happened?<br />- It... it's my grandson.
2970772 2973271 - Gail: Mom! Thelma!<br />- Daniel: Grandma!
2973273 2976010 Oh, it's them.<br />Come on, get out.
2977545 2979077 - Gail: Thelma!<br />- Alan and Daniel: Thelma!
2979079 2980212 Gail: Hi.<br />Have you seen a woman
2980214 2982682 with, like, white hair?<br />A real lady?
2983383 2985719 - Gail: Thelma!<br />- Alan: Thelma!
2985820 2988721 - Gail: Thelma!<br />- Alan: Thelma!
2988723 2991724 Oh, we can't make that.
2991726 2992758 Daniel: Grandma!
2992760 2993826 Alan: What's that?<br />Is that...
2993828 2995327 - Daniel: Grandma!<br />- Gail: That is interesting.
2995329 2997998 - Daniel: Oh, shit.<br />- Gail: Thelma!
2999099 3001199 - (Lyfe Line clicks, beeps)<br />- (Thelma grunts)
3001201 3002568 - Daniel: Oh, shit.<br />- Gail: What?
3002570 3003736 Her Lyfe Line.
3003738 3005671 Alan: What is it?<br />Do you have a location?
3005673 3007272 - Gail: What's it say?<br />- She's here.
3007274 3009642 - She's here.<br />- Ah. Where? Oh.
3013748 3016916 (Lyfe Line beeping)
3021121 3023491 - (beeping stops)<br />- (music calms)
3025492 3029196 (music intensifies)
3032534 3037637 (pensive music playing)
3038540 3040573 (chuckles) We are crazy.
3040575 3043843 (both laugh)
3047515 3049783 (sighs, chuckles)
3065165 3067268 Gail:<br /><i>Could it have fallen off?</i>
3067501 3069203 Not on its own.
3069369 3072304 Alan: Just to consider<br />all our options,
3072306 3074774 is it... is it possible<br />she had another TGA?
3074776 3075908 - Her behavior's erratic.<br />- I... I don't know.
3075910 3077843 It seems like it's within<br />the realm of possibility.
3077845 3078978 Let me think about it.
3078980 3080813 I'm... I'm just... I'm going<br />to Google it just to...
3080815 3083350 Daniel: I told her<br />not to take it off.
3084318 3086184 Alan: "Acute onset<br />of anterograde amnesia."
3086186 3090823 I can't remember if it was<br />on her wrist in the car.
3090825 3093626 She likes her independence<br />from that thing. She just...
3093628 3094894 Sometimes she puts it<br />in her bag.
3094896 3097863 I... I can't remember.
3097865 3100465 "...signs indicating damage<br />to a particular area..."
3100467 3101934 Daniel:<br />I should have walked her in.
3101936 3104637 It's in the past. Hmm?
3106908 3109274 - Why didn't you?<br />- She didn't want me to.
3109276 3110810 - (Alan reading indistinctly)<br />- Why didn't she want you to?
3110812 3113345 - I don't know, Mom! I...<br />- Alan: Don't yell.
3113347 3116414 I'm sorry, I'm sorry,<br />I just... I'm upset.
3116416 3118718 Gail: Yeah, we're all upset.
3118820 3122755 This is exactly what<br />we have been trying to avoid,
3122757 3124790 and now my mother is at large.
3124792 3127860 I can't...<br />I can't do anything.
3127862 3131798 I literally can't do anything.<br />I'm such a little bitch.
3131833 3133833 Don't call yourself that. God.
3133835 3138336 I truly have<br />no ability to do anything.
3138338 3140773 I can't do anything<br />with my hands. I can't...
3140775 3142240 What do you want to do<br />with your hands?
3142242 3143208 Daniel: I don't know. Nothing.
3143210 3145443 I just... I can't...<br />I don't know facts.
3145445 3147445 I have no qualifications<br />for any jobs.
3147447 3148480 I... I can't do math.
3148482 3150583 It's basically why Allie<br />and I aren't together.
3150585 3154352 Because you couldn't do math?<br />I thought she could do math.
3154354 3156622 It's just another thing<br />that I can't do.
3156624 3158356 I haven't done the ID
3158358 3160291 because every time<br />I go on the computer,
3160293 3162595 I get all confused<br />by the stupid website
3162597 3164730 and all the classifications
3164732 3166666 and the... and the...<br />and the terms.
3166668 3168934 Do you have visual,<br />uh, what's it?
3168936 3172906 - Processing.<br />- Processing issues?
3172974 3174740 Sure. Or maybe I'm just
3174742 3175975 a stupid little bitch<br />who can't do anything.
3175977 3177743 - Don't say "bitch."<br />Stop saying "bitch."<br />- (groans) Stop.
3177745 3180980 I lost Grandma. Fuck!
3182850 3186886 (both sigh)
3198966 3201101 Ben:<br />Think we're getting closer?
3209577 3212279 - Thelma?<br />- Hang on.
3212580 3215413 - What is it?<br />- I don't know where we are.
3215415 3216749 Ben: Oh, don't say that.
3216751 3219752 Thelma: I thought<br />we were heading north.
3221055 3222855 I'm gonna go find help.
3222857 3227126 Oh, no, Ben, give me a moment.<br />Let me orient myself.
3227128 3229330 (scoffs) Ben.
3229797 3231398 (sighs)
3231866 3234200 Ben, don't make a scene.
3234202 3237703 You don't listen to me, Thel.<br />You don't listen to anybody.
3237705 3241674 If I listened to you,<br />I'd be your roommate by now.
3241676 3243441 Go home, Ben.<br />You don't want to be here.
3243443 3246912 - We should call your family.<br />- Out of the question.
3246914 3248047 What about your grandson?
3248049 3250049 - Thelma: No. No.<br />- Why?
3250051 3252651 Because I'm not like you, Ben.
3252653 3257089 As much as you may want me<br />to be, I like to be useful.
3257091 3259257 We're more alike<br />than you think.
3259259 3261359 What's that supposed to mean?
3261361 3263063 We're old.
3263865 3265363 Diminished.
3265365 3268369 We're a liability<br />to the ones we love.
3268401 3270937 You can tell<br />yourself different,
3270972 3273839 but you know<br />that they're worried sick.
3273841 3275674 What's to worry about?
3275676 3279011 I move from point to point.<br />I don't complain.
3279013 3282347 I am the same.<br />And you would be, too,
3282349 3284482 if you stopped feeling sorry<br />for yourself.
3284484 3285753 It doesn't work that way.
3285787 3288587 You start acting like a baby,<br />people treat you like a baby.
3288589 3290157 Bullshit.
3291391 3294160 You know how I know?<br />Because I couldn't...
3294162 3296829 I couldn't hear her<br />when she fell.
3302637 3304904 We're not what we were.
3308543 3310411 We're the only ones left.
3310812 3314114 The least we can do<br />is take care of each other.
3317417 3319420 Call your family.
3322924 3326625 I don't need them.<br />I don't need you.
3326627 3328961 I just needed your scooter.
3329063 3330863 (gasps)
3332867 3334567 - (Thelma gasping)<br />- (engine revs)
3334569 3338871 - (tires screech)<br />- (debris clattering)
3338873 3342842 (tires squeal, engine revving)
3344444 3346812 (scoffs) We were stopped.
3346814 3348948 Did you put<br />the parking brake on?
3348950 3351250 I didn't know there was one.
3351252 3354987 I didn't know.<br />I... I'm sorry, Ben.
3355056 3356789 You're not sorry.
3356791 3359024 (somber music playing)
3359026 3361894 Ben, where are you going?
3365199 3367501 I'm not waiting!
3368936 3370537 (grunts softly)
3380882 3383317 Gail:<br /><i>We've all lost her before.</i>
3383517 3386018 I've lost her at Gelson's<br />a few times.
3386020 3387686 The woman likes<br />to keep moving.
3387688 3389889 Especially<br />if she has that cart.
3389924 3391456 When she sets her mind<br />to something,
3391458 3392490 there's no stopping her.
3392492 3393926 She doesn't eat,<br />she doesn't sleep.
3393928 3396862 She just, like,<br />keeps that laser focus...
3396864 3399198 - Hmm.<br />- ...till the task is done.
3399200 3400833 This is different<br />than Gelson's.
3400835 3402201 Alan: Well, I'm aware<br />it's different.
3402203 3403669 But she's a grown woman
3403671 3406038 who's a little faster<br />than you would hope.
3406040 3407806 And you can't<br />be responsible for her
3407808 3409407 every second of every day.
3409409 3411110 We shouldn't have<br />put that on you.
3411112 3412778 It was too much.
3412780 3415582 I know that<br />she's not gonna live forever.
3417018 3419952 But I just... when it happens,
3419954 3425325 I want it to be not horrific,<br />you know?
3426894 3429363 Like, a good death.
3430631 3432366 There is no good death.
3436170 3437670 (Gail speaking quietly)
3437672 3439004 I'm gonna take a walk.
3439006 3440205 Oh, can we go with you?
3440207 3442207 - I'll go with him.<br />- I want to go with him.
3442209 3445010 No, no, no, no, I'm...<br />I want to go alone.
3445012 3447080 I just need a little, um...
3447248 3448847 - space to think.<br />- Where are you walking?
3448849 3450683 - Where are you gonna go?<br />- I don't know, just...
3450685 3452651 Do you... do you have<br />your phone on you?
3452653 3453886 Gail: Please don't keep it<br />on silent.
3453888 3456288 - No. Here. Take... take this.<br />- Can you do that for me?
3456290 3457923 For my mental health?
3457925 3458924 I'm gonna be close. It's fine.
3458926 3462594 - Just... It's fully charged.<br />- Daniel: Okay.
3462596 3464665 Alan:<br />And it just snaps on here.
3464865 3466333 There we go.
3466934 3469735 Have a nice walk. I love you.
3469737 3471271 I love you, too.
3471973 3477177 (suspenseful music playing)
3478679 3481381 (footsteps approaching)
3481649 3484718 (pants)
3500868 3503704 (cardiac monitor beeping)
3535703 3539506 (indistinct chatter over TV)
3547281 3549383 (Thelma gasps, groans)
3568936 3571438 (Thelma groans)
3574909 3579446 (groans) Oh. Oh.
3579780 3581315 Oh.
3582316 3587287 (groans, sobs)
3590758 3593959 - (car engine revving)<br />- (tires screeching)
3593961 3598063 (pensive music playing)
3598065 3601234 (whimpers)
3607374 3610644 (groans)
3613180 3614748 Oh.
3621055 3623322 (hearing aids beep)
3623324 3626360 (sound fades)
3664031 3667868 (gentle music playing)
3734101 3735400 (hearing aid beeps)
3735402 3737571 (crickets chirping)
3738839 3740340 Ah.
3740542 3742241 (sighs)
3742243 3743810 Thank you.
3744144 3745712 You're welcome.
3747047 3750717 I'm sorry. About all of it.
3751452 3754354 But we gave it a good try,<br />didn't we?
3755155 3756857 Yes, we did.
3757825 3759359 (sniffles)
3761128 3765632 I lived with my parents<br />till I was 23. (sniffles)
3765634 3767901 Then I moved in with Teddy...
3768469 3771938 and I lived with him<br />until I was 91.
3772840 3776943 I've lived just me<br />for two years now.
3777945 3780547 Gets lonely sometimes.
3782617 3784684 And I miss Teddy.
3787221 3791625 But I... I tried sushi,<br />and I liked that quite a bit.
3795630 3798431 I've enjoyed my time alone.
3802002 3804604 I guess I wanted more of it.
3810612 3812979 (vehicle approaching)
3814248 3816550 I think I know her.
3817384 3820554 - Lois?<br />- Thelma!
3821889 3823155 (laughs)
3823157 3825424 We just saw <i>Swan Lake.</i>
3825426 3828561 And it was set<br />during the Korean War,
3828563 3831330 so the dancers were<br />all dressed like soldiers.
3831332 3833332 I... I don't know<br />that I understood it,
3833334 3838236 but it was beautifully staged.<br />I think it was very political.
3838238 3841239 - Sounds interesting.<br />- Lois: It was, yes.
3841241 3843008 So, where can we take you?
3843010 3846345 Oh. Just home.<br />Ben, what's your address?
3846347 3850516 We're heading<br />to 1534 San Fernando Road.
3850518 3853151 (mellow music playing<br />over radio)
3853153 3856221 Well, we've come this far.<br />We might as well finish it.
3856223 3858525 Well, what about your show?
3858660 3863363 There is no show<br />without Daddy Warbucks.
3864264 3866031 (chuckles)
3866033 3870104 (intriguing music playing)
3870672 3872472 (thud)
3885052 3886686 (bell dings)
3890491 3891958 (sighs)
3897097 3898765 Twenty-one.
3900100 3902969 - What now?<br />- We wait.
3903203 3905237 - Allie: (over cellphone) <i>Hi.</i><br />- Daniel: <i>Hey.</i>
3905239 3908608 Thanks for picking up. Um...
3908843 3913780 Are you slinging those<br />crunchy-crunchy tiki tacos?
3913914 3917584 Yeah. Yeah, that's why<br />they pay me the big bucks.
3918085 3919752 How's it going with you?
3919754 3921486 Daniel: (over cellphone) <i>Okay.</i>
3921488 3923857 Um, bad, actually.
3924592 3926559 My grandma's missing,
3926561 3929294 <i>and I'm camped out</i><br /><i>at an old folks' home</i>
3929296 3931697 <i>- with my parents.</i><br />- Wait, what? How?
3931699 3933666 She went to visit a friend,
3933668 3935535 and then they went<br />missing together.
3935537 3936702 <i>It's been a couple hours</i><br /><i>so far.</i>
3936704 3939337 <i>And the whole thing is just...</i><br /><i>I don't know, it's...</i>
3939339 3941039 They didn't sign out<br />or anything,
3941041 3942675 but I was supposed<br />to watch her, so...
3942677 3947713 Okay, well, uh, could she have<br />just gone somewhere
3947715 3949080 without telling you guys?
3949082 3950182 Daniel:<br /><i>That's what we thought.</i>
3950184 3952050 We thought it could be<br />a Souplantation situation.
3952052 3953018 Allie: (over cellphone)<br /><i>A... a what?</i>
3953020 3956087 No, nothing. I mean,<br />it's possible, I guess.
3956089 3958225 Well, I only asked<br />because she's...
3958760 3961259 obsessed with errands, right?
3961261 3964429 Well, yeah. She has<br />a healthy respect for errands.
3964431 3966231 Well, I know<br />you really love her.
3966233 3968734 I'm sure you're<br />super worried, but...
3968736 3973174 Maybe she's just...<br />doing something.
3973240 3976475 <i>You know? On her own.</i>
3976477 3977777 Yeah.
3977779 3979545 (soft music playing)
3979547 3981148 I hope so.
3982483 3984717 <i>Hey, I've also</i><br /><i>been wanting to call you.</i>
3984719 3987653 <i>I was thinking about</i><br /><i>taking some classes,</i>
3987655 3989555 maybe an adult math class,
3989557 3993425 or, like, just brush up on...<br />on some of those essentials.
3993427 3995327 - What are you talking about?<br />- Daniel: <i>Self-improvement.</i>
3995329 3997630 I'm just saying I...<br />I can learn to do more things,
3997632 4001066 adding and subtracting,<br />uh, fractals.
4001068 4004102 <i>Like, I can take the great</i><br /><i>leap from boy to man.</i>
4004104 4005605 You're driving me nuts,<br />do you know that?
4005607 4009776 (laughs) I do. I...<br />I do know that, very much.
4010010 4012344 Sorry.<br />It's so freaking hot in here.
4012346 4014580 Okay, well, go for a walk.
4014582 4016883 My folks asked me<br />to stay close.
4016885 4018518 (Allie chuckles)
4018520 4021088 <i>Well, if you ever take</i><br /><i>that great leap,</i>
4021288 4025059 for what it's worth,<br />I think you could make it.
4026728 4028861 - Oh, my God!<br />- Allie: <i>What?</i>
4028863 4033034 (whispers)<br />Um, there's, uh, been a guy<br />in here the whole time.
4034401 4038205 Thelma: We used to call bread<br />the staff of life.
4038840 4042276 But now nobody wants<br />to eat bread.
4043243 4046478 But there are delicious breads<br />being made now.
4046480 4048079 It's a conundrum.
4048081 4050716 And some people like toast<br />with toppings.
4050718 4052986 Mm. Interesting.
4053186 4056421 The way we think about bread<br />has changed so.
4056423 4060294 You want bread?<br />We've got bread.
4060528 4062929 - There you go.<br />- (Thelma chuckles softly)
4065465 4066832 (crunching)
4066834 4069535 - Ugh!<br />- (groans, spits)
4069537 4072339 - Oh, it's like a rock.<br />- I can't even chew it.
4072372 4073840 (grunts)
4075743 4077311 (bell dings)
4088523 4091292 - Can you see him?<br />- Ben: That's him.
4096531 4098698 Ah, he's coming out.
4102604 4104138 (door opening)
4105807 4107774 Oh, come on.
4107942 4109575 - (grunts)<br />- (Ben grunts)
4109577 4112379 (intriguing music playing)
4146514 4148246 You keep a lookout.
4148248 4151985 Uh, I'm gonna go in<br />and try to talk to them.
4152020 4155286 If things get funny,<br />you go for help.
4155288 4158958 - How will I know?<br />- Well, you'll be with me.
4159259 4160927 (cellphone beeping)
4161294 4163963 Automated Voice:<br /><i>Microphone enabled.</i>
4165900 4168000 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
4168002 4170870 (suspenseful music playing)
4188388 4190024 Thelma: Hello?
4190058 4193360 Ben: (over hearing aid)<br /><i>Thel, I think I see a door</i><br /><i>in the back.</i>
4204271 4207141 <i>Lamp down ahead.</i><br /><i>Lift those heels.</i>
4213514 4215614 <i>There's a stack</i><br /><i>of loose Hummels, or...</i>
4215616 4216916 <i>or maybe they're gnomes</i>
4216918 4219652 <i>or some kind of</i><br /><i>little animals.</i>
4219654 4221288 <i>Be... be careful.</i>
4230330 4232098 <i>Gets a little hairy up ahead.</i>
4232100 4233967 Take your time.
4239439 4241108 - (shattering)<br />- Oh!
4241576 4243143 Ben: <i>What happened?</i>
4243211 4245945 Oh. W... what are you doing?
4245947 4247880 Thelma: It's a mess.
4248482 4249648 Don't clean!
4249650 4252718 Thelma: Well, you have to<br />with glass. It's not right.
4252720 4256290 Ben: <i>Not now.</i><br /><i>Get your act together.</i>
4263030 4266166 <i>- Easy, easy.</i><br />- Thelma: Ah.
4268903 4274807 Uh, yes! Ah!<br />Well done. Well done, Thel.
4274809 4276876 <i>Okay. Let's go.</i>
4278345 4279946 Harvey: Yes, sir.
4280081 4282882 Hesitating is gonna cost you.
4282984 4285052 Yeah, quite a bit.
4285318 4289155 No, there's gonna be<br />some unpleasantness ahead.
4289157 4291624 I mean, we just don't want him<br />sitting in holding
4291626 4293592 any longer than he has to.
4293594 4296996 Yes, I know, but even<br />good boys make mistakes.
4296998 4298831 (beads jangling)
4298833 4301268 (radio playing indistinctly)
4304839 4307673 - Hi. May I help you?<br />- Who's that?
4307675 4311478 I'm Thelma. Thelma Post.
4312713 4313946 Huh.
4313948 4316283 You might recognize me.
4317118 4319253 From the telephone.
4319452 4323856 Hmm. No, I can't say<br />I do, ma'am.
4324058 4326091 Uh, at this moment in time,<br />we're closed.
4326093 4327193 But why don't you<br />come back tomorrow?
4327195 4329895 I've got a shipment of, uh,<br />what do you call them?
4329897 4332565 A woman inside a woman<br />inside a woman.
4332567 4335400 - Uh, Russian nesting dolls?<br />- Yeah.
4335402 4337002 Now, at least<br />I think they're women.
4337004 4338270 I mean, I haven't checked.
4338272 4340873 There may be a little fella<br />in there somewhere. (chuckles)
4340875 4342543 Where's my money?
4346647 4348581 - Sorry?<br />- You heard me.
4348583 4351851 Yes, I heard you.<br />I'm not sure I understood.
4352053 4353986 You called me.
4354021 4356889 You pretended<br />to be my grandson.
4357124 4359424 You took advantage of me.
4359426 4363263 (tense music playing)
4375743 4378143 That's a hefty accusation.
4378145 4380581 I think you've got<br />the wrong idea.
4380815 4384518 Listen, buddy,<br />I came a long way.
4385452 4387887 Hm, well,<br />you've made a mistake.
4387889 4390522 That's okay. You know,<br />I make mistakes, too.
4390524 4393424 But let's not make another.
4393426 4396230 (handbag rustling)
4396564 4399531 I'm... I'm contacting<br />the authorities.
4399533 4402035 (line ringing)
4405239 4406839 Well, what are you<br />gonna tell 'em?
4406841 4408107 You broke into my store?
4408109 4409842 Operator: (over cellphone)<br /><i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>
4409844 4412211 I'd like to report a robbery.<br />Ah! Uh, uh...
4412213 4413846 (cellphone beeps, chimes)
4413848 4415482 The... Thel?
4416617 4417783 Thel, are you there?
4417785 4421954 Look, I just want you to know<br />that it's not personal.
4422023 4425024 I mean, we're not<br />selling like we used to.
4425026 4426659 People these days, they...
4426661 4429094 they don't care<br />about old things.
4429096 4431730 I'm just trying<br />to keep the lights on.
4431732 4433367 We have a lot of lights.
4434501 4438172 - So it's very expensive.<br />- Yeah. Thank you, Michael.
4439173 4442308 I bet this whole thing<br />has been a headache, huh?
4442310 4446280 Look, I don't expect you<br />to leave here empty-handed.
4446380 4448347 Why don't we make a deal, huh?
4448349 4449949 I'll keep your deposit,
4449951 4452284 but I'll cut you in<br />on the next one.
4452286 4454653 Yeah, I'm happy to negotiate.
4454655 4456221 I'll give you<br />the senior discount.
4456223 4459126 Well, that isn't gonna work<br />for me.
4459660 4461126 And you should know,
4461128 4463062 if I'm not out<br />in five minutes,
4463064 4465599 my partner calls the cops.
4466801 4468435 You want me to beg?
4469637 4471305 Then I'll beg.
4472039 4473740 - (grunts)<br />- (Thelma gasps)
4476177 4479011 Harvey: Look, what do you<br />want me to do?
4479013 4480279 Give it back?
4480281 4483116 I'll lose the store.<br />I'll be out on the street.
4483551 4485352 Nobody cares.
4486220 4488520 Nobody cares about me.
4488522 4491692 Everybody's buying<br />their shit on Amazon.
4491892 4495195 I just take<br />what I need to survive.
4495296 4497730 So, why do you need it so bad?
4497732 4502035 Because it's mine,<br />and I decide who gets it.
4503571 4505572 You're being unreasonable.
4507308 4510077 Michael, get my keys.
4511245 4512845 (music builds)
4512847 4514615 - (Thelma groans)<br />- (grunts)
4515016 4516717 Ah...
4517918 4519985 Uh, uh...
4519987 4522187 - Huh?<br />- No, no. I, uh...
4522189 4524691 Thelma: How did I... huh.
4525026 4528660 Uh, I, uh... oh. Ah.
4528662 4531263 I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
4531265 4535168 I... I don't recognize<br />this pla...
4535236 4537738 Oh. I, uh...
4538606 4543110 I... I need to call<br />my husband.
4544378 4546547 Hm. Of course.
4546580 4548180 What's your name, dear?
4548182 4550582 - I'm Harvey.<br />- Harvey?
4550584 4553986 - Harvey: Yeah.<br />- Harvey? Harvey.
4553988 4555187 Harvey: Come and sit down now.
4555189 4556021 Harvey.
4556023 4557356 Harvey: We'll call him.<br />Yeah, yeah.
4557358 4560093 Talk to me, Thel.<br />What's going on?
4565199 4568000 I'm terribly sorry<br />for the imposition.
4568002 4569868 (scoffs) Oh, please.<br />It's all right.
4569870 4571937 No. Happens to the best of us.
4571939 4573705 The mind is a funny thing.
4573707 4574940 Now,<br />what's your husband's number?
4574942 4576843 - I'll get you home.<br />- (gun cocking)
4577878 4580681 (music intensifies)
4581048 4583283 My money, Harvey.
4585352 4587886 Michael! Coward.
4587888 4590157 (thrilling music playing)
4590724 4592292 (glass shattering)
4599834 4601435 (Ben grunts)
4605873 4608373 Thelma: You were<br />very convincing, Harvey.
4608375 4610209 Why, you could have<br />been an actor.
4610211 4613445 Not a star, maybe,<br />but even so, what a waste.
4613447 4615681 Do you know<br />how to use that thing?
4615683 4617950 - No.<br />- (gunshot)
4617952 4621720 Fuck! Jesus Christ!<br />Okay, okay, okay.
4621722 4623323 Where is it?
4624758 4626792 - In there.<br />- Where?
4626794 4629995 It's been deposited into<br />my account on the computer.
4629997 4632164 - Well, get it out.<br />- I can't.
4632166 4634800 - What do you mean, you can't?<br />- Michael does the computers.
4634802 4637904 Oh, this is ridiculous. Oh.
4643711 4647247 It's just me and you now.<br />(chuckles)
4647414 4649249 Ben: And me.
4649984 4653186 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- My friend.
4653487 4658690 Here. Here, you take this.<br />I... I need both hands.
4658692 4661928 - What happened to Michael?<br />- I beat him up.
4662763 4666533 Where's the mouse?<br />There's the mouse.
4667001 4668835 Come on. Move.
4672840 4675807 What? What is that?<br />It's a shoe!
4675809 4677342 - It looks like a shoe.<br />- It's a shoe.
4677344 4680245 Ben, don't look at it.<br />Look at him.
4680247 4683448 W... what do I do with it?<br />I... I'm gonna "X" it.
4683450 4684850 No, no, don't do that!
4684852 4686920 Well, you don't know<br />what it is.
4689890 4691458 (mouse clicking)
4694995 4696730 That's a baby.
4698032 4701768 Oh, God.<br />I don't know how to do this.
4702269 4703869 (music fades)
4703871 4705739 (cellphone vibrates)
4711078 4712044 Hello?
4712046 4713145 Thelma: (over cellphone)<br /><i>Danny?</i>
4713147 4715047 Grandma! Oh, my God.
4715049 4718016 Are you... okay?<br />Where are you?
4718018 4719552 Thelma: <i>I'll tell you,</i>
4719554 4721787 <i>but you have to promise me</i><br /><i>something.</i>
4721789 4722821 What?
4722823 4724558 Thelma: <i>Come alone.</i>
4725259 4728628 (intriguing music playing)
4729897 4731865 - (Gail sighs)<br />- (cellphone vibrates)
4734969 4736503 - Alan: Huh.<br />- Gail: What?
4737271 4738837 His heart rate is slowing.
4738839 4741373 (thrilling music playing)
4741375 4742841 We're getting closer.
4742843 4744409 - Yeah, yeah. (groans)<br />- We're getting closer.
4744411 4746278 I just... okay,<br />now a little more,
4746280 4748582 little more, little more.<br />Ah! Ah!
4752554 4755622 (suspenseful music playing)
4756591 4759526 (car engine revving)
4763864 4765998 (tires screech)
4766000 4768935 (thrilling music playing)
4768969 4770435 Tell me<br />what you're looking at!
4770437 4772538 It... it's a family<br />and a baby,
4772540 4773740 and they're everywhere.
4773742 4775340 Daniel: (over cellphone)<br /><i>Great, great. Are there words?</i>
4775342 4778110 Thelma: Yeah, it says,<br />uh, Lincoln Mutual.
4778112 4781346 Yep! It's an ad.<br />You need to find the "X."
4781348 4784216 - Well, there's no red "X."<br />- No, but it's not always red.
4784218 4786987 Sometimes they hide it,<br />so look closer.
4790024 4791558 Top right.
4797298 4800867 - I "X"ed it.<br />- Daniel: Great! Um...
4800968 4803603 - (cellphone vibrates)<br />- Daniel: Remember the...
4803605 4805370 the computer's the library,
4805372 4807306 and the search bar's<br />the librarian.
4807308 4810008 <i>You're gonna ask it</i><br /><i>for information,</i>
4810010 4811644 <i>and then it's gonna</i><br /><i>give it to you.</i>
4811646 4813145 Thelma: (over cellphone)<br /><i>Where is the bank?</i>
4813147 4815447 Ye... uh,<br />are you talking to me?
4815449 4817949 No, I... I'm asking<br />the machine.
4817951 4819051 It can't hear you.
4819053 4822154 Is there a Sari or a Siri,<br />or is she not in there?
4822156 4823656 She's not there.<br />That... that's in your phone.
4823658 4824823 But y... you don't need her.
4824825 4827594 Thelma: <i>I don't talk to her.</i><br /><i>She talks to me.</i>
4838005 4839773 "Valley...
4840274 4842542 financial...
4842544 4844744 dot com."
4844746 4847948 Hit "Enter." You see "Enter"?
4849350 4850851 Thelma: I'm in!
4863464 4865263 What's the password?
4865265 4866131 I don't know.
4866133 4869535 Look around you.<br />Is there, uh, a notebook
4869537 4872739 <i>or a desk, papers,</i><br /><i>anything like that?</i>
4875309 4877543 - Oh, my God.<br />- Daniel: <i>What?</i>
4877545 4879545 The password is "Password."
4879547 4880646 Daniel: <i>Classic!</i>
4880648 4883984 Now, click inside of that box<br />and type that in.
4885119 4886519 (chuckles) That's cute.
4886521 4889856 Goddamn dumbass<br />password, Michael.
4897131 4898798 Come on!
4898999 4900833 (car horn honks)
4900835 4903436 I'm moving to "Transfer."
4904539 4906539 Oh, God.
4906541 4910410 - What?<br />- It wants me to join a gym!
4911278 4913211 No, I... I'm gonna tell it no.
4913213 4914980 Good. Remember what we do?
4914982 4917449 The "X," no matter the color.
4917451 4919086 Daniel: <i>That's right!</i>
4921523 4923656 - I'm in.<br />- Yes!
4923658 4925257 Thelma: <i>Be ready in five.</i>
4925259 4926826 Okay, I'll be there soon.
4928563 4930797 (keyboard clacking)
4933200 4936037 (sighs) Oh, Jesus.
4955757 4957557 (objects clattering)
4957559 4960527 (music fades)
4961361 4963230 Harvey: Uh, no! Oof.
4963397 4966833 - (gasping)<br />- (air hissing)
4973808 4976274 I assume it was you
4976276 4978979 on the phone<br />pretending to be Danny.
4980180 4982482 He doesn't have the range.
4984519 4986586 I'm not your grandma.
4987755 4990288 But if I was, I'd tell you<br />there comes a time
4990290 4993458 when you can't listen<br />to anyone but yourself.
4993460 4996963 (pensive music playing)
5001636 5004238 He called you a dumbass.
5005205 5007941 He said it quietly,<br />but I heard it.
5025292 5028628 Ah! (breathes deeply)
5028630 5030797 You're insane.
5031733 5033733 (sighing heavily)
5043878 5046913 - Is that it?<br />- That's it.
5047447 5049283 And he can't get it back?
5051686 5053987 (breathes heavily)
5059594 5061359 - (gunshot)<br />- Hey, wait!
5061361 5063729 (gunshots)
5063731 5068235 (breathes heavily)<br />He can't get it back.
5073708 5076210 Don't take people's money.
5076644 5078678 Clean up your store.
5079246 5081282 Be nicer to Michael.
5081649 5085952 This whole thing<br />has been really ridiculous.
5087354 5090957 (sighs) And don't smoke.
5092627 5096729 (dramatic music playing)
5113447 5115715 - What?<br />- I didn't say anything.
5115717 5117184 Oh.
5118920 5122320 - (car engine roaring)<br />- (tires screech)
5122322 5123589 Get in!
5123591 5127861 (soft music playing)
5135637 5137304 Did you get it?
5139907 5141708 We got it.
5142910 5145210 - (laughs)<br />- (chuckles softly)
5145212 5147546 Oh, Danny, Danny,<br />you remember Ben.
5147548 5149882 Yeah. Hey, Ben,<br />it's really great to see you.
5149884 5151149 Ben: Good to see, Danny.<br />How you doing?
5151151 5155256 - Daniel: I'm all right. Yeah.<br />- (emergency alert blaring)
5156658 5161326 Ben: Whoa. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.<br />We're famous.
5161328 5163495 - Ha, ha! (chuckles)<br />- (Thelma chuckles)
5163497 5165132 Hello!
5168903 5171937 Today was a good day.
5171939 5174305 I hope you know<br />I'm gonna buy you
5174307 5176509 a new scooter and a new phone.
5176511 5179745 Oh, well, maybe we can go out<br />to lunch someday.
5179747 5180946 Thelma: I'd like that.
5180948 5184482 We could try<br />the famous Belwood cafeteria.
5184484 5186317 I hear they have<br />terrific melons.
5186319 5188654 (both laugh)
5188656 5192858 - Or... we could go out.<br />- Both good options.
5192860 5195895 - We'll make a plan, dear.<br />- Good, good, good.
5195897 5199066 - (chuckles)<br />- Ben: Ah!
5201301 5203370 - You be well.<br />- I will.
5208776 5210444 Break a leg, Ben!
5213280 5214881 (Thelma chuckles)
5215616 5217750 Does he know what that means?
5217752 5219486 I'm not sure.
5219654 5224991 He's new to the theater,<br />and his hip is titanium.
5225093 5226659 Detective Morgan:<br />But he didn't say anything?
5226661 5229061 Gail: No, but he... he...
5229063 5231429 Has Daniel ever wandered off<br />like this before?
5231431 5233800 Gail: Never. Not like this.
5235937 5239073 Oh, my God! Mom! Oh!
5240340 5241907 Your eye. Are you okay?
5241909 5243743 I'm all right, darling.<br />I'm all right.
5243745 5246347 Gail: Oh, we were so worried<br />about you!
5246446 5248182 Ma!
5255690 5258425 (smacks lips, sighs)
5259359 5260960 You drove.
5261394 5262862 I did.
5263998 5266433 You went back to the buffet.
5266868 5268402 (chuckles)
5268870 5270301 (chuckles softly)
5270303 5271670 I did.
5271672 5273506 - What happened?<br />- (chuckles)
5273508 5275608 Well,<br />I'll tell you everything,
5275610 5277442 but there's something<br />I'd like to do first,
5277444 5278878 if you would indulge me.
5278880 5280447 Of course!
5280581 5283582 I'm just Annie,<br />Mr. Warbucks, sir.
5283584 5285885 I'm sorry I'm not a... a boy.
5285887 5288087 Resident: It's her<br />first night here, sir.
5288089 5291858 Well, Annie, how would you<br />like to go to a movie?
5292593 5295795 And then you could go<br />to the Roxy
5295797 5301734 and then some ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's,
5301736 5306173 and then a cab ride<br />around Central Park.
5310477 5312212 Um, well...
5313748 5315215 Yeah, wow.
5315415 5319153 Golly. Golly, Daddy,<br />Mr. Warbucks.
5319854 5322054 - It's a strange show!<br />- (shushes)
5322056 5325892 (birds chirping)
5325993 5330164 (gentle music playing)
5350818 5353953 (music continues)
5361128 5362895 (Thelma chuckles)
5375176 5377843 (music fades)
5377845 5380147 I'm glad to come here.
5381883 5384118 These are good graves.
5384919 5386252 Do you like them?
5386254 5387620 Yeah. As in, what?
5387622 5388921 Do I want to be buried<br />in them?
5388923 5391456 (chuckles)<br />I got a ton of graves.
5391458 5393494 Oh, yeah?
5393828 5395928 Beautiful graves.
5396097 5397897 Some here.
5398532 5400967 Mostly back in New York.
5401135 5405470 Uh, does Allie plan on being<br />buried in a Jewish cemetery?
5405472 5406805 Oh, I don't know, you know?
5406807 5409074 We haven't really had<br />the graves conversation yet.
5409076 5411011 - (chuckles)<br />- Taking it slow.
5411612 5413980 Oh, we may have enough.
5417785 5419952 You get very greedy.
5420788 5422755 You want to see<br />what's gonna happen
5422757 5424491 to those you love.
5426527 5429094 (gentle music playing)
5429096 5430930 I love you.
5431198 5434833 And if you ever do die,
5434835 5436702 I'm really, really, really<br />gonna miss you.
5436704 5440172 And I know you know that,<br />but I just, uh...
5440174 5444344 I wanted to say that<br />while we're here.
5444712 5446246 While we're here.
5449650 5451585 Wherever I go...
5452920 5455422 I'm not gonna worry about you.
5457158 5459660 You're gonna be okay, Danny.
5471005 5472573 (sniffling)
5476877 5478577 (music continues)
5478579 5482848 Look... look at the bottoms<br />of those trees.
5482850 5485918 I mean, look how gnarled<br />they are, and yet they live.
5485920 5487252 - Look.<br />- I'm looking.
5487254 5488287 Thelma: You should be taking
5488289 5489755 - photographs of this.<br />- (laughs)
5489757 5491690 Thelma: Is this unbelievable?
5491692 5492825 Daniel: It's incredible.
5492827 5494793 Yeah, I mean,<br />it's unbelievable.
5494795 5497296 Look at this.<br />This thing is still alive.
5497298 5499264 - Daniel: What? This tree?<br />- Yeah, look at it.
5499266 5501166 It should be down<br />on the ground.
5501168 5503102 Thelma: But it's unbelievable.
5503104 5505305 (laughs) It's crazy!
5505673 5507407 What spirit.
