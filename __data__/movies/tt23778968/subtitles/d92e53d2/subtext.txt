75771 78643 Daniel: <i>This is an ad<br />for Neiman Marcus.</i>
78643 80254 Get rid of it.
80254 82473 You don't have to trash it.<br />Could just stay in your inbox.
82473 84301 Thelma:<br />Yeah, but who needs it?
84301 85911 What's an inbox?
85911 88479 It's where, um, where<br />all your emails are stored.
88479 90133 It's like a big folder
90133 92266 on your computer<br />with all of the emails.
94920 96487 Thelma: <i>What's a computer?</i>
96487 97706 [chuckles]
97706 100448 - This is a computer.<br />- [laughs]
100448 103146 I know this is a computer,<br />but what is it really?
103146 104495 How does it function?
104495 106671 Daniel: <i>It's, um...</i>
107194 108325 Let's come back to that.
108325 110849 [both chuckle]

146407 149671 - Thelma: Pretty fast.<br />- Daniel: Very fast.
150802 152326 It's not a stuntman?
152326 154893 No, that's the whole thing.<br />He does it all himself.
156199 158636 - Thelma: Wow.<br />- Daniel: That's Cruise.
158636 160421 Thelma: Terrific.
160899 164599 - You got big plans tonight?<br />- Eh, just dinging around.
166035 168080 You spoken to Allie?
168080 169604 We're still on a break.
169604 172346 I'm just, you know, trying<br />to give her a little space,
172346 174913 and... I'm just not<br />really sure
174913 176219 what my selling points<br />are at the moment.
176219 177394 - [chuckles]<br />- Thelma: Oh,
177394 179657 well, you're<br />a wonderful grandson.
179657 182617 You know computers.<br />You have your hair.
182617 184271 I think it's gonna start<br />to go early.
184271 186011 Well, you can't<br />get hung up on that.
186011 189101 Yeah. We're just in different<br />places as people, you know?
189101 190755 She... she thinks I'm stuck.
191887 193715 You're too young to be stuck.
194542 195847 Daniel: I don't feel young.
196370 198110 Well, I don't feel old.
198110 199938 - Oy.<br />- "Oy" is right.
199938 201375 [both chuckle]
201853 205857 You're gonna land<br />on your feet. Like Cruise.
207729 210340 Thelma: Who is it they say<br />lands on their feet?
210340 211385 I think cats.
211385 212734 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
212734 214518 But I guess in a way,<br />it could be about both.
214518 215476 Mm.
215737 217217 Do you want this?
217608 220307 It's a marble.<br />I got a ton of these.
220307 221830 Sure.
221830 224311 How about some pretzels?<br />I got a ton of pretzels.
224311 225616 Only if, yeah,<br />you don't need them.
225616 227401 Thelma: No, I can't chew them.
227401 229925 What... Could you please<br />just wear this when I go?
229925 231927 - Ugh, I'm fine.<br />- I know you are.
231927 233320 You... you...<br />you probably won't need it,
233320 235104 but I'll just feel better<br />if you wear it, okay?
235104 236453 What's the point?
236453 238368 - If I fall, I'm toast.<br />- Daniel: Come on.
238368 239891 Thelma: That's why<br />I don't fall.
239891 241241 Daniel: Don't say that, please.
241937 244287 - For my mental health?<br />- [Thelma grunting]
244287 245680 [exhales] Okay.
246420 248726 - For my guardian angel.<br />- Thank you.
248726 249988 Daniel: It's... it's just a,<br />you know,
249988 252034 - precautionary measure.<br />- Thelma: Mm.

611872 613351 Who told her that?
613351 614918 Gail: <i>She spoke to him.<br />She spoke to Daniel.</i>
614918 616920 And then I tried calling him<br />and I can't get him.
616920 618530 And he's not picking up<br />his phone?
618530 620358 No. I'm gonna try him again.

631369 632414 Hello?
632936 636679 And he was going on and on<br />about how you hit someone,
636679 638507 and it was worse<br />than you think.
638507 642076 - And she was pregnant and...<br />- I hit a pregnant woman?
642076 643251 Like, I struck her<br />with my fist?
643251 644818 Oh, no, no, no,<br />it was a car accident.
644818 646471 No, yeah, this was all happening<br />inside of a car.
646471 648430 Oh. Okay, well, that...<br />Yeah, that makes more sense.
648430 650388 Well, what are you<br />talking about?
650388 652652 No, I misunderstood.<br />[chuckles]
652652 654262 Why weren't you picking up<br />your phone?
654262 655437 I was asleep.
655437 657352 At 10:30?<br />I called you at 10:30.
657352 658745 And then... and then...
658745 660398 Yeah, but I went out<br />last night with some friends.
660398 662749 - You didn't drive, did you?<br />- Um...
662749 665926 Did you get drunk? You know,<br />alcohol is a major depressant.
665926 667754 It's... Wendy Horowitz's son
667754 669103 is completely hooked<br />on Don Julio.
669103 671540 - Don Julio.<br />- He's... He can't hold a job.
671540 672759 He's in and out of rehabs.
672759 675152 He's...<br />Has no sense of agency.
675152 676719 - Alan: And he vapes.<br />- Gail: He vapes.
676719 679374 He's completely lost,<br />and he may never find himself.
679374 680723 Are you paying attention?
680723 683552 - Yes, I understand.<br />- Do you?
683552 684988 Yeah. I mean,<br />it's... it's an issue.
685554 688644 Mom, did you really think<br />it was Daniel?
688644 690385 I mean, how did you think<br />this was real?
690385 691995 Mom, you thought<br />it was real, too.
691995 693736 Well, she was very convincing.
693736 695129 Well, she was scared,<br />your mother.
695129 696608 - I was sc...<br />- We were all scared.
696608 699220 I wasn't quite as scared,<br />just for the record.
699220 701875 We'll see what happens<br />when you get a call, buddy.
701875 705095 I wouldn't be fooled.<br />My mind is sharp as a tack.
705095 706357 What?
706357 707402 I said I wouldn't be fooled.
707402 708838 My mind is sharp as a tack.
709578 711841 - What's he saying?<br />- He's making a joke.
711841 713408 - Oh.<br />- You want to try it again?
713408 714757 - What's the joke, Alan?<br />- Never mind.
714757 716498 - Never mind.<br />- Gail: It wasn't a joke.
716498 717891 - Never mind.<br />- Well, you know,
717891 719153 it was a close call, but...
720415 721416 it's over now.
721808 722765 Everything's okay.
724114 725725 I am so embarrassed.
725725 727378 - No.<br />- Don't be. You're home.
727378 728989 You're safe.<br />That's all that matters.
729772 731252 But I sent the money.
733471 734646 Oh.
739782 740914 You're speeding, Danny.
743568 745396 Well, we could report<br />a tracking number
745396 748051 if it's with Western Union,<br />FedEx, UPS.
748051 749792 With a letter,<br />our only real option
749792 751228 is to contact<br />the postal service,
751228 753665 and with these types<br />of things, the odds are slim,
753665 755015 especially without<br />the address.
755015 756712 I think I have it here.
756712 758496 Aw, it's such a mean<br />thing to do. It's just sick.
758496 759802 Alan: Isn't there anything<br />that can be done?
759802 761325 A database of some kind.
761325 763284 We have no moral center<br />as a society.
763284 765242 This is a systemic issue.
765634 767505 - You have it?<br />- I don't have it.
768028 769420 If it's any comfort,
769420 771248 these kinds of scams<br />are increasingly common.
771248 773816 Well, how do they know<br />who I am?
773816 776645 They contact people at random<br />using telephone listings
776645 779474 - and social networking sites.<br />- Like Facebook?
779735 780910 Sure. Like Facebook.
780910 784131 Well, how can Zuckemborg<br />let this happen?
784131 785567 Sorry?
785567 788396 Shouldn't Zuckemborg<br />be able to fix this?
789136 790398 Are you on Facebook?
790920 792530 - Am I?<br />- No you're not. She's not.
792530 794184 - Uh, this was a tangent.<br />- [softly] No.
794184 796056 Detective Morgan: I would<br />suggest canceling your cards
796056 797927 and freezing your accounts<br />until you're sure
797927 799189 you didn't provide<br />any information
799189 801844 that can leave the door open<br />to more fraud.
801844 804368 Beyond that, there's not much<br />we can do at this point.
804368 805630 Alan: Hmm.
806893 807894 Detective Morgan: Sorry.
808808 809852 No, you're not.
809852 812072 [pensive music playing]
812072 813551 Daniel: You want a blanket?
814857 817164 Or, um, water or anything?
817164 820602 No, I'll just close my eyes<br />for a minute.
823823 825476 Gail: She gets confused.
825476 827435 - Daniel: Not really.<br />- Gail: It's more than before.
827435 829306 Daniel: I haven't noticed<br />that big of a difference.
829306 830830 Little things, maybe.
830830 832309 Gail: She's gotten<br />these calls before.
832309 834007 We may be entering<br />a new phase.
834007 836226 What? What do you mean...<br />[chuckles] ...a new phase?
836226 839708 Now may be the time<br />where we really consider
839708 842145 whether or not living alone<br />is the best option.
842145 844147 - You think we're there?<br />- Gail: We're just...<br />We're considering it.
844713 846497 I lost my wallet last week.
846846 850110 I don't think that was a sign<br />of my mind deteriorating.
850110 851546 No, that's a lack of presence, sweetheart.
851546 852982 Did you order<br />a replacement license?
852982 855028 - Yeah, yeah. I did.<br />- Good 'cause you don't wanna be
855028 856856 driving without that.<br />You could end up in a database.
856856 858205 Why are you obsessed
858205 859336 with databases<br />all of a sudden?
859336 860685 You don't want<br />to end up in one.
860685 862252 Okay, well,<br />I just think that...
862992 864298 this can be handled.
864298 865560 Maybe I can handle it.
865560 866953 Alan: What are you proposing?
866953 869303 Daniel: I will come over more,<br />I'll call every day,
869303 871044 and I'll make sure that<br />she keeps her Lifeline on.
871044 872523 Oh, my God,<br />I didn't tell you this.
872523 874743 Susan's mother fell<br />into a fire pit.
874743 875918 Completely died.
875918 877833 What?<br />Why are we talking about this?
877833 879879 Well, because things happen<br />to people as they age.
879879 881706 Weird, crazy things like that.
881706 883099 - Was it on?<br />- I didn't ask.
883099 884405 I assumed it was.
884405 886276 Alan: This wouldn't have<br />happened a year ago.
886276 888148 She's not as self-reliant<br />as she was.
888148 890063 Gail: We can't just keep doing<br />what we're doing.
890063 891455 She's 93.
891455 892979 Alan: Well, maybe it's time<br />for assisted living.
892979 895198 [high-pitched whirring]
904991 906514 Daniel: You sure<br />I can't stay over?
906514 907950 Oh, no. No, no.
907950 909604 - I've got things to do.<br />- Okay.
911780 913434 - [Thelma groans]<br />- Yeah.
916567 919788 - For my mental health.<br />- [Thelma sighs]
921268 923444 [music fades]
932801 934977 [Thelma sighing]
936631 938459 Thelma: [voice breaking]<br />Aw, Teddy.
940417 942202 I made a mistake.

993644 994776 [hearing aid beeps]
1008964 1010531 [dog barks]
1026590 1029463 - Thelma: Uh, hi.<br />- Hello.
1029463 1031247 Thelma: Do we know each other?
1031247 1033380 - [music calms]<br />- I'm not sure.
1033380 1036078 Thelma: [sighs] You...<br />you look so familiar.
1036078 1038211 [chuckling]<br />Do you know Judy? Judy Miller?
1039038 1040822 I don't think so.
1041344 1044043 Do you know Ellen?<br />Ellen Marcus?
1044043 1046045 No, I don't think so.
1046958 1049918 - Well, have a nice day.<br />- Bye, now.
1049918 1051659 [music intensifies]

1082124 1083647 Hi.
1083647 1087129 - I... I found the address.<br />- What? What address?
1087129 1088522 Thelma: <i>From the scam.</i>
1088522 1091133 It was this tiny slip<br />of paper. [chuckles]
1091133 1093179 You'll never guess<br />where I found it.
1093179 1094876 - Grandma, I'm sorry,<br />it's going...<br />- Thelma: <i>It was...</i>
1094876 1096182 - <i>in the trash can...</i><br />- ...in and out.
1096182 1097357 I can't hear you that well.
1097357 1099446 ...in the bathroom<br />at the post office.
1100011 1102405 Wait, you went<br />to the post office?
1102405 1103580 Yeah.
1103580 1104755 Daniel:<br /><i>Well, how did you get there?</i>
1104755 1105974 Well, I walked.
1105974 1107410 Grandma. [chuckles]
1107410 1109151 That's far.<br />You should not have done that.
1109151 1111153 Well, it's a few blocks.
1111153 1115026 Y... you can't... You need<br />to tell me if you're gonna...
1116245 1118726 go somewhere,<br />so that I can take you, okay?
1119292 1120728 Thelma: <i>What?</i>
1120728 1124384 You... you should not have<br />gone that far on your own.
1124906 1127126 But I found it.<br />I have it here.
1127126 1128344 Daniel: <i>I know.</i>
1128344 1131173 Maybe it's better<br />to just pause for now
1131173 1135046 and we can<br />figure it out together. Okay?
1135569 1136744 What about my money?
1136744 1139050 Am I supposed to just<br />let them have it?
1139050 1140661 Well, but the odds<br />of getting it back
1140661 1142141 are pretty slim, right?
1142141 1143664 I mean,<br />the most important thing
1143664 1146406 is that you don't overdo it,<br />that... that you're safe.
1147189 1148625 <i>I'm sorry about the money,</i>
1149235 1151976 <i>but it... it could<br />have been a lot worse.</i>
1152847 1154762 Are you okay?<br />You're at home now?
1154762 1156198 Yeah, I'm at home.
1156198 1157808 Daniel: <i>Oh, great.</i>
1157808 1161072 <i>You need to go anywhere,<br />just tell me. I can take you.</i>
1161072 1165076 Okay, darling.<br />Appreciate that. Speak soon.
1165076 1166904 - Love you. Oh.<br />- [line beeps]
1170430 1174434 Cynthia, I... I'm afraid<br />I need a bit of a favor.
1174434 1177741 Uh, it's an odd situation,<br />and... Uh...
1178394 1181789 Oh, Sarah.<br />I thought you were Cynthia.
1182050 1186489 She did? How awful.<br />Oh, Sarah, I'm so sorry.
1186489 1190450 No, no, no. Never mind.<br />Forget I called. All is well.
1190450 1193322 Hello? Is Harvin there?
1193322 1194410 [intriguing music playing]
1194410 1195629 Well, what happened?
1196238 1199502 Oh, a stroke.<br />Oh, I am so sorry, Joan.
1199502 1201156 A heart attack?
1201156 1202375 Sepsis?
1202375 1204159 He moved to Cleveland?
1204159 1206553 Well, when did this happen?
1206553 1209251 Oh, God,<br />I called Cynthia again.
1209251 1213212 Sarah, it was a mistake.<br />I know she's dead. Thank you.
1224484 1229967 [clock ticking]
1231404 1233580 [thrilling music playing]
1234189 1236713 [line ringing]
1237279 1239890 Danny, I need a ride.
1240935 1243329 Just to get this<br />out of the way up top,
1243764 1246506 you were not at home.
1250336 1252207 All my friends are dead.
1252207 1255254 What? Don't say that.<br />[chuckles]
1255254 1257952 Well, it's true.<br />They're all popping off.
1257952 1261129 I used to be<br />in four lunch groups.
1261564 1263392 Who's left? Judith?
1264001 1266961 She can't hear anything,<br />and she's a hunchback now.
1266961 1269920 I... I wouldn't want to have<br />lunch with her alone.
1269920 1273968 Herman's in Canada.<br />Mona doesn't leave the house.
1273968 1276100 I could ask Lee Horner<br />to join us,
1276100 1277754 but I don't have her number.
1277754 1280279 And Ruth burned up<br />in a fire pit.
1280279 1282281 I heard that. I'm sorry.
1284587 1286850 I didn't expect to get so old.
1287677 1288809 Well...
1289984 1291246 I'm glad you did.
1293640 1295206 Who do you know here, again?
1295206 1298427 You remember Ben. Ben Halpern?<br />He was married to Cheryl.
1298427 1299820 Oh, yeah.
1299820 1301952 Yeah, you guys used to see<br />each other all the time.
1301952 1305565 I always found him,<br />I don't know, s... s... soft.
1305565 1308132 - Soft?<br />- I... I don't know. Fussy.
1308132 1309090 Oh.
1310265 1311832 Thelma: Cheryl's dead, too.
1312572 1315270 She fell down some stairs<br />in their house.
1316315 1318969 She was there for hours<br />before they found her.
1318969 1320101 Poor thing.
1320101 1321276 I remember.
1322190 1324584 [grunts] This car is filthy.
1324584 1326760 I've taken good care of it.<br />I'm gonna clean it.
1326760 1329415 Oh, you don't clean it.<br />Who raised you?
1329415 1330590 Your daughter.
1330590 1332983 This is your father's<br />influence.
1332983 1335203 There are coins<br />all over the floor.
1335203 1338685 They fall out of his pockets<br />'cause he's got no waist.
1338685 1341775 Every time I ride with him,<br />I make five bucks.
1341775 1346345 [intriguing music playing]
1351393 1354178 [gear shift clicks,<br />engine shuts off]
1355136 1358226 - Want me to come in?<br />- Oh, I'm just saying hello.
1358226 1360968 I won't be long.<br />Thirty minutes.
1362012 1363710 Daniel: If you need anything,<br />I'll be here.
1363710 1365233 - Thelma: Okay.<br />- [Daniel chuckles]
1365233 1366190 [car door closing]
1394436 1396395 [cardiac monitor beeping]
1404446 1407971 [upbeat music playing<br />over speaker]
1433432 1436217 Ben: Then you'll go<br />to The Roxy
1436217 1439612 and then an ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's
1439612 1443572 and then a hansom cab ride<br />around Central Park.
1444617 1446923 Gloria, that's your cue.
1446923 1449448 Oh, right.<br />And what do I say?
1449448 1451014 Theater Director: "Golly."
1451014 1455062 All right. Okay.<br />Do you know? Golly.
1455062 1456585 Theater Director:<br />Just "golly." Just the line.
1456585 1457804 Gloria: I did, didn't I? Yes?
1457804 1459153 Theater Director:<br />Uh, not... not quite.
1459153 1460981 Gloria: We went through that,<br />and I said...
1460981 1462896 Theater Director: Why don't we<br />go back to hansom cab,
1462896 1464985 and then grab golly?
1465246 1467640 Ah, it is good<br />to see you, Thel.
1468336 1471295 - You look terrific.<br />- Ah, I'm a balloon.
1471295 1472601 [both chuckle]
1472601 1474516 Well, what's with this?<br />Are you doing a play?
1474516 1477911 Yes. <i>Annie.</i><br />I got Daddy Warbucks.
1477911 1481480 - Well, that's a big role.<br />- Yeah, I wasn't expecting it.
1481480 1483394 I thought I'd be part<br />of the chorus
1483394 1485179 - or maybe Mr. Bundles.<br />- [chuckles]
1485179 1487573 We open tonight,<br />but Miss Hannigan...
1488530 1489662 she's senile,
1490358 1492447 and we got a lady<br />playing Roosevelt
1492447 1494318 because there's never<br />enough boys.
1494318 1498279 And Gloria, that's Annie,<br />she's a total amateur.
1498279 1501848 I'm going to have to bring<br />a lot of pizzazz.
1502762 1505025 You know,<br />I think about Teddy often.
1505547 1507070 What a special guy.
1507593 1509899 Uh, how long has it been?<br />Two years now?
1509899 1512641 - Just about two.<br />- Yeah, five for my Cheryl.
1513642 1515644 It feels like a dream.
1517820 1520780 - How are you holding up?<br />- Let's not be maudlin.
1520780 1522433 You going to show me<br />your place?
1522433 1524044 Oh, oh, sure, sure. Come on.
1524566 1526263 Got a TV.
1527526 1529005 Window. Plants.
1529789 1530790 Do you mind?
1532705 1534881 Infection starts<br />from the hands.
1536012 1538275 Director is trying to get me<br />to touch Gloria
1538275 1540060 in that scene<br />where I adopt her,
1540060 1542584 but I'm not going to do it.<br />It's not worth it.
1542584 1544586 If it makes it worse,<br />so be it.
1544586 1546545 It's not like<br />we're being reviewed.
1547589 1551593 Oh, this is Gary.<br />We call him Starey Gary.
1551593 1552899 It's not an insult.
1553160 1554553 It's just something<br />that happens.
1555423 1556772 I don't think he minds.
1557338 1559340 Everybody does it.<br />Not just me.
1559340 1560602 Everybody calls him that.
1560907 1562299 [intriguing music playing]
1562299 1565520 Ah. Isn't she a beauty?
1565520 1568915 Three wheels,<br />43 miles per charge,
1568915 1570917 and bright red,<br />so you can see me coming.
1570917 1573615 And a little basket<br />for whatever you need.
1573615 1575356 I like to put bread in there.
1575356 1578402 Not... not a whole bread<br />but just little pieces.
1578402 1580013 You put them in loose?
1580013 1582929 No, no, no.<br />In... in bags. Ziploc.
1582929 1584713 You think I could borrow it?
1586062 1587194 Borrow my scooter?
1587498 1588630 Well, I...
1590327 1592199 I'm in a bit of a situation.
1592199 1595898 - What?<br />- I'm in a bit of a situation.
1596246 1597900 It's... [exhales]
1597900 1600947 Oh, it's a headache.<br />The less you know, the better.
1601643 1604472 Well, if it involves<br />my scooter, it involves me.
1605342 1607780 I... I don't want to say<br />in front of Gary.
1609085 1611566 Uh, Gary, can you<br />give us a second?
1612654 1614395 Thelma: Is he going to listen?
1614395 1616963 I'm not sure,<br />but he's going to watch.
1618486 1620009 Have you got a telephone?
1620009 1621141 Yes.
1622185 1623230 [cellphone beeps]
1626320 1628322 Automated Voice:<br /><i>Microphone enabled.</i>
1631107 1632892 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
1634284 1635982 [over hearing aids]<br /><i>I got scammed,</i>
1636678 1639725 <i>but I have the address<br />where I sent the money.</i>
1639725 1646557 <i>It's a P.O. box in Van Nuys.<br />1534 San Fernando Road.</i>
1646557 1648777 <i>I'm on my way there now.</i>
1649125 1652651 <i>I'm going to try to figure out<br />who took it and get it back.</i>
1656655 1658221 <i>What are you, nuts?</i>
1658744 1661268 <i>That's absurd.<br />You got to tell the police.</i>
1661268 1665054 <i>- Oh, they're no use.<br />- What about your family?</i>
1665794 1669493 <i>- Not with this.<br />- It's a bad idea.</i>
1669493 1671495 <i>But you have a better one?</i>
1671495 1674498 <i>You're not thinking straight.<br />You're grieving.</i>
1675151 1678241 <i>At least you have your health.<br />Be grateful for that.</i>
1694257 1696956 Listen, why don't you stay<br />for lunch?
1697696 1702788 We have a beautiful cafeteria<br />and wonderful melons. Fresh.
1703310 1704267 Sure.
1706443 1708881 D... do you think<br />I could try it out?
1708881 1711274 I... I may be in the market<br />for one.
1712406 1713668 [scooter beeps]
1713668 1717150 I love driving. [chuckles]<br />I miss it.

1753055 1755971 Winston. Ah, I'm taking it.
1762673 1764240 Uh, are you talking to me?
1764240 1765894 [tires screech]

1859466 1861120 - [tires screeching]<br />- [grunts]
1861120 1864166 - Let's just talk.<br />- Everybody wants to talk.
1864166 1867300 My God.<br />I just needed your scooter.
1867300 1869693 Please be a doll<br />and don't make a fuss.
1871086 1873262 My grandson's<br />parked a block away.
1873262 1874742 I don't have much time.
1874742 1876309 You left your grandson<br />in the car?
1876309 1878180 Well, he's 24.
1878180 1880835 [exhales] Please don't make me<br />go through you,
1880835 1882532 - Ben.<br />- Oh, no, you couldn't.
1882532 1884186 I got a titanium hip.
1884186 1886493 Thelma: Well, should we<br />put that to the test?
1886493 1888974 I'm going,<br />with or without you.
1889278 1892368 I'm not going to let you<br />go alone. I won't.
1895545 1897286 [timer ringing]
1898940 1901247 [intriguing music playing]
1902291 1905425 Hi. Um, I'm looking<br />for my grandma.
1905425 1907122 Thelma Post. White hair.
1907122 1908471 A little wobbly.<br />Very determined.
1908471 1909516 [chuckling] Okay.
1909516 1910952 Daniel: She's not...<br />she's not...
1910952 1912519 She doesn't live here,<br />but she's visiting a friend.
1912519 1913999 She would have come in<br />like 30 minutes ago.
1913999 1915870 Huh.<br />So, I'm not seeing her here...
1915870 1917828 - Okay.<br />- ...but...
1920701 1922572 - Grandma?<br />- Resident 1: Hello?
1922572 1923965 Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry.
1923965 1926576 Uh, I'm just looking<br />for my grandma. Sorry.
1926576 1927926 - Resident 2: Hello?<br />- Hi, there.
1927926 1929536 - You took my scooter?<br />- What? No.
1929536 1931973 You sound like the man<br />who took my scooter.
1931973 1934497 I didn't take... I promise,<br />I... I... No, I'm...
1934497 1936543 You're getting me nervous.<br />You're getting me nervous.
1936543 1937500 Sorry. I'm gonna go.
1937500 1938632 - Yeah, go.<br />- Uh, good luck.
1938632 1940025 What do you mean, "Good luck?"
1940025 1941809 If you took my scooter,<br />don't tell me good luck.
1943115 1944986 Do you know Ben? Uh...
1945769 1947510 Uh, Halpern, I believe?
1951079 1953690 Mom, uh, we may have<br />a little situation here.
1953690 1956084 No, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.<br />No, I'm not in jail.
1956084 1958347 No. Um, it's Grandma.
1964397 1966225 I got to be back by 8:00.
1966225 1968357 It's opening night,<br />and I don't want to miss it.
1968357 1970055 I got it. I got it.
1982937 1984678 Daniel:<br /><i>Um, I checked every room.</i>
1984678 1985940 <i>She's not answering her phone,</i>
1985940 1988464 <i>but she should<br />have her Lyfe Line on.</i>
1988464 1991032 So has she ever<br />wandered off before?
1991032 1992425 Never. Not like this.
1992425 1994296 One time, I thought I lost her<br />at Souplantation,
1994296 1996777 but she was just going back<br />for, uh, little pizzas.
1996777 1998474 Souplantation.
1998474 2000607 It was a buffet restaurant.<br />You could go back for more.
2000607 2004002 I can't believe it was<br />actually called Souplantation.
2004002 2005568 - I never processed that.<br />- Alan: Oh, wow.
2005568 2007266 Gail: Well, it had things<br />she could chew.
2007266 2008310 Alan: She can't chew anything.
2008310 2010008 She can chew some things,<br />Alan.
2010008 2011226 It's, like...<br />It's confusing, you know,
2011226 2012575 what she can and can't chew.
2012575 2015883 Like, she can't have a salad,<br />but she can...
2015883 2017537 Like, last week,<br />she ate a cashew.
2017537 2019060 So she hasn't<br />wandered off before?
2019060 2021802 Except to a salad bar?<br />By choice?
2022324 2023717 - Exactly. Right?<br />- Yeah.
2023717 2025849 Well, um, I don't want<br />to alarm you guys,
2025849 2028200 but one of our residents<br />is missing.
2028200 2030506 - Alan: Oh.<br />- Um, yeah. Ben Halpern.
2030506 2031768 - Oh, Ben.<br />- Yeah, she, she um...
2031768 2033074 Rochelle:<br />Are the two of them involved?
2033074 2035816 No. No. They're...<br />they're not even...
2035816 2037818 She doesn't even really<br />like him all that much.
2037818 2039515 Oh, so is there bad blood?
2039515 2040908 - What are you insinuating?<br />- Rochelle: Nothing.
2040908 2042214 No, no, no. Not like that.
2042214 2043998 We're just... we're just<br />trying to understand.
2043998 2045652 You know he has<br />a show tonight.
2045652 2047132 - How would we know that?<br />- No.
2047132 2048655 Gail: Well, does his family...
2048655 2050700 Have you notified<br />his family that he's missing?
2050700 2052528 He doesn't have any family.
2052528 2053877 - So, no.<br />- Oh.
2053877 2055270 Aww.
2055270 2056837 Well, what can<br />we be doing here?
2056837 2059144 Can you guys send out<br />some kind of senior alert?
2059144 2060928 - Uh, Silver Alert?<br />- A Silver Alert.
2060928 2062234 - Rochelle: No.<br />- Colin: No.
2062234 2063974 We are not authorized<br />to do that.
2063974 2065759 The police have to declare her
2065759 2067065 - a missing person.<br />- A missing person.
2067065 2069241 But she is a missing person.
2069241 2071330 - Don't you have somebody...<br />- We don't know where she is.
2071330 2073419 - It's only been an hour,<br />right?<br />- Yeah, just one hour.
2073419 2075290 Right,<br />it hasn't been that long.
2075290 2076465 Yeah, curtain's not until 8:00.
2076465 2077640 What's the show?
2077640 2078772 You're still talking<br />about the show?
2078772 2079773 <i>- Annie.<br />- Annie.</i>
2079773 2081644 - Oh, that's a good one.<br />- Oh.
2081644 2084038 So, uh, does Thelma have any<br />specific medical conditions
2084038 2085213 that we should know about?
2085213 2088042 She's had breast cancer,<br />double mastectomy,
2088042 2090175 sepsis, edema,
2090175 2092742 valve replacement,<br />hip replacement,
2092742 2094483 arrhythmia, brain tumor.
2094483 2096224 I think she actually has<br />a brain tumor right now.
2096224 2097791 Yeah, the doctor said it was<br />growing slowly...
2097791 2099227 - That's right. Yeah.<br />- ...so they could...
2099227 2101055 She has a brain tumor.<br />...just leave it in there.
2101055 2102970 And, so, all of that<br />and a brain tumor<br />at the moment.
2102970 2104014 Yeah.
2104537 2106321 Wow, uh, thank you.
2106321 2108497 Thank you so much<br />for telling us all of that.
2108497 2110151 And she had the TGA, right?
2110151 2113067 - TGA?<br />- Transient global amnesia.
2113067 2114764 Yeah, it was about a year ago.
2114764 2117419 And, um, she just...<br />she got very disoriented.
2117419 2119378 She didn't know who she was.<br />She didn't know who we were.
2119378 2121162 Lasted only just about<br />an hour.
2121945 2123599 But it was...<br />it was unsettling.
2125340 2127864 But she's a tough cookie.
2127864 2130128 Obviously, we want help<br />finding her.
2130128 2133696 It's just,<br />it might still be a, you know,
2134219 2137831 "going back to the buffet"<br />type of situation, I think.
2137831 2141661 Well, the good news is,<br />they rarely go far.
2142270 2146535 [thrilling music playing]
2168078 2169776 Ben: Uh, Thel,
2169776 2171778 why does this street<br />look so familiar to me?
2171778 2173562 Thelma:<br />We're stopping at Mona's.
2173562 2177131 Oh, I haven't seen Mona<br />since Berlin.
2177131 2179264 That was a fun trip,<br />wasn't it?
2179612 2181701 What year was it? '95?
2181701 2184051 Um, '98, I think.
2184051 2187097 Ah, it was a bumpy flight,<br />but otherwise it was terrific.
2188621 2191580 You know Mona<br />is obsessed with me.
2191885 2193408 We... we never acted on it,
2193408 2195367 but she would always stare<br />at my legs
2195367 2197151 whenever I had short pants on.
2197151 2199893 [chuckles]<br />Whatever you say, buddy.
2199893 2202722 Now, if you're right,<br />maybe we could use it.
2204245 2206116 Why are we stopping at Mona's?
2206116 2207292 To get a gun.
2207292 2210425 Oh, my God.<br />What do we need a gun for?
2210425 2212035 Thelma:<br />It's just a precaution.
2212035 2215343 Couple of schmegegges like us<br />turning up unannounced...
2215343 2217258 I like to be prepared.
2217258 2218825 Do you even know<br />how to use it?
2218825 2222611 Well, how hard can it be?<br />Idiots use them all the time.
2223525 2226224 You're going to have<br />to distract her.
2226224 2227877 She's still sharp.
2227877 2229966 This is not going to be<br />so easy.
2229966 2231968 Maybe I could do my monologue.
2232491 2234014 I'd rather you didn't.
2234449 2237539 [suspenseful music playing]
2238279 2239454 [tires screech]
2253555 2255253 - [birds chirping over TV]<br />- [door closing]
2262303 2263435 Mona?
2265306 2268527 Thel, darling,<br />did we make a date?
2268527 2272008 Oh, no. No, no.<br />We were in the neighborhood.
2272008 2276404 - I would have put shoes on.<br />- [chuckles] Ben's here, too.
2276404 2277840 Good to see you, doll.
2279189 2282889 - Are you all right?<br />- Fine, fine.
2286327 2289461 Oh. Oh. Sit, dear.<br />Don't... don't clean.
2289461 2291637 Okay, okay.
2293116 2294422 [gasps]
2294422 2296337 - Is it a roach?<br />- [gasps]
2296337 2298513 Oh, you... you...<br />you got bugs?
2298513 2302343 I've been hunting 'em.<br />Can't seem to knock 'em off.
2302343 2304258 Oh, they're resilient.
2304258 2307348 That's why they make<br />worthy adversaries.
2307348 2310699 You get one,<br />there are ten more<br />to replace him.
2310699 2313049 I've learned<br />to pick my battles.
2313789 2315748 So, uh, how are you?
2316662 2319099 - How's your health?<br />- I'm alive.
2319099 2321667 Ben: Oh, isn't that something?
2321667 2325061 - I got to use the bathroom.<br />- Oh, good, dear.
2327020 2329631 Um... [clicks tongue]
2329631 2332852 We were just talking<br />about Berlin. [chuckles]
2333113 2335898 [intriguing music playing]
2342731 2343689 [grunts softly]
2346039 2346996 [grunts]
2347475 2350913 Ben: We stayed<br />at that wonderful hotel.
2351349 2355570 The Kimch...<br />Kimpinchky? Kimsky?
2355570 2357616 Did we take a trip?
2360488 2363186 Um, that was a long time ago.
2363186 2365275 [stairs creak]
2367756 2368627 Oh.
2370933 2374589 Um, you know,<br />I'm over at Belwood now.
2375590 2379159 They have<br />the most wonderful melons.
2395262 2396568 [exhales]

2423682 2425031 Honeydew.
2426336 2427642 Jade dews.
2429252 2430993 - Berries.<br />- Berries?
2430993 2433256 Mm, yeah.<br />All kinds of berries.
2434257 2437391 Raspberries. Blueberries.
2437391 2439611 [bed rattles]
2440916 2442178 [gasps]
2452101 2453320 Ben: Blackberries.
2455235 2456584 Cherries.

2462895 2463852 [grunts]
2464853 2466986 - [pants]<br />- [music stops]

2474733 2477126 [thrilling music playing]
2480695 2484699 "Annie, get your goddamn hound<br />out of my pool."
2489443 2492925 Thel, did we make a date?
2493621 2496058 Oh, no, no, I...
2496058 2497973 I was just<br />in the neighborhood.
2497973 2500889 Mona:<br />I would have put my shoes on.
2502587 2506286 Well, I think it's time<br />we were on our way.
2506286 2509681 - You're leaving?<br />- I know, I know.
2509681 2511900 We'll have to get<br />a lunch on the books.
2511900 2513249 I'd like that.
2514076 2516949 [chuckles]<br />Can we get you anything?
2516949 2519168 I've got everything I need.
2519647 2524043 [melancholic music playing]
2524043 2525087 Goodbye, doll.
2539014 2542191 - [TV powering on]<br />- [birds chirping over TV]
2545760 2548894 [birds chirping]
2562255 2563735 [scooter beeps]
2566694 2570829 - Uh, she needs a charge.<br />- Oh.
2570829 2572482 [music fades]
2572482 2574528 I need to get IDs<br />from everyone.
2575094 2576748 Sure. Here.
2579054 2580142 Rochelle: Thank you.
2580882 2582362 [Daniel clicks tongue,<br />hesitates]
2583015 2584364 Can't find your wallet?
2584364 2586845 I... I, um... I have it.<br />I'm just not seeing my ID.
2586845 2588237 You're not even looking.<br />You're just patting.
2588237 2589369 Oh, yeah.
2589717 2592154 - Gail: Let me help.<br />- I, uh... Uh...
2592154 2593895 You didn't order<br />a replacement license?
2593895 2595810 - No, I did. I did.<br />- Alan: Don't lie.
2595810 2597638 - It's in there.<br />- Just tell us you didn't
2597638 2599597 - I'd rather know<br />than be lied to.<br />- Daniel: It's...
2600336 2602034 I haven't, uh, yet.
2602034 2604036 - Gail: Why would you<br />keep this from us?<br />- Daniel: Becau...
2604036 2605907 Why would you keep this<br />from us? This sucks.
2605907 2607822 - Daniel, that's really bad.<br />- But I'm... I'm gonna do it.
2607822 2608867 Can't drive without a license.
2608867 2610129 He can't drive<br />without a license.
2610129 2611652 I mean, he could,<br />but he... he shouldn't.
2611652 2613001 Daniel:<br />Okay, thank you, everyone.
2613001 2616135 You have to take care<br />of your vehicle, Daniel.
2616135 2617658 - Do you understand my...<br />- I understand.
2617658 2619225 This is the basics<br />of adult life.
2619225 2622707 Dad, please don't embarrass me<br />in front of...
2623751 2625971 Colin... [chuckling]<br />...and Rochelle.
2625971 2627886 We can give you guys a second.
2632281 2634370 [sighs]
2634762 2636590 Allie was very good for you<br />in that way.
2636590 2638853 She was very organized,
2639332 2642727 left-brained,<br />a grounding force.
2642727 2645077 Can we please not talk<br />about Allie?
2645077 2647470 [clicks tongue]<br />I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2647470 2649516 - Daniel: Thank you.<br />- Gail: I know it's hard.
2649908 2652084 I just don't like<br />to see you suffer like this.
2653172 2656044 - Makes me want to cry.<br />- What? No.
2656044 2657959 Gail: I do.<br />It makes me very sad.
2657959 2659700 - Daniel: It's okay.<br />- I have to cry.
2659700 2662660 - Alan: Okay.<br />- I just need to get it out.
2664879 2666533 Do you want us to...
2667752 2671233 sit with you and...<br />to get a replacement license?
2671233 2672321 Daniel: I... I can handle it.
2672670 2674976 - Let's just deal with one...<br />- I'm sorry.
2674976 2676891 ...family crisis<br />at a time, okay?
2682941 2686771 - [sighs]<br />- Chaim took this. My cousin.
2687728 2689338 Did you ever meet Chaim?
2689338 2691384 - No.<br />- From Hinsdale.
2692385 2693734 He's not doing so hot,
2693734 2695649 but this is<br />a beautiful picture.
2695649 2697042 [camera shutter clicks]
2697042 2698783 She shouldn't be living<br />like that.
2700088 2701655 She's managing.
2702351 2704876 Ben:<br />How is she getting her meals?
2704876 2707617 Uh, and when is the last time<br />she got out of that chair?
2708270 2709576 She's wasting away.
2709576 2713058 We all have our good days<br />and our bad days.
2713058 2715451 - And what's today?<br />- We'll find out.
2717497 2718498 [scoffs softly]
2718977 2720761 Gary's going to wonder<br />where I am.
2720761 2724069 What's with you?<br />Do you miss that place?
2724069 2727507 - I like that place.<br />- What's to like?
2727507 2731467 I swim twice a week.<br />There's wonderful classes...
2731467 2734949 cooking classes,<br />painting classes, oopsie upsy.
2734949 2736777 - "Oopsie upsy"?<br />- Ben: Oopsie upsy.
2736777 2738910 That's when a professional<br />comes in and shows us
2738910 2741173 how to pick each other up<br />after we fall.
2741173 2743784 There's a tub lift,<br />a shower lift,
2743784 2746178 and a dual lift<br />for when a couple falls.
2746178 2748006 Does that happen often?
2748006 2752010 Uh, not often, but it happens.<br />Usually on a hill.
2752010 2755665 You have to use each other's<br />weight as a counterbalance.
2755665 2757189 Sounds interesting.
2757189 2760540 [pensive music playing]
2761454 2765153 Cheryl used to cook,<br />pick up our socks,
2765153 2766894 keep the place together.
2767808 2770419 I'll take help<br />where I can get it.
2770419 2771986 I'm not ashamed.
2772813 2774293 It's not the same.
2775424 2776512 Ben: Why?
2777035 2779080 I always picked up the socks.
2785739 2786784 Hm.
2795575 2798099 - She posted.<br />- Gail: What?<br />She posted something?
2798099 2799405 - I think it...<br />- Gail: No.
2799405 2800841 Yeah, five minutes...<br />By accident, I think.
2800841 2802321 - Five minutes ago.<br />- Gail: Oh, my God.
2802321 2804366 - Look, look.<br />- Let's see.<br />Let's see. Let's see.
2804366 2805324 Do you recognize anything?
2805324 2806716 Gail: Make it bigger. Zoom in.
2806716 2808718 - Can you enhance it?<br />- Daniel: Enhancing.
2808718 2810982 I see gas pumps,<br />a blue car, a pigeon.
2810982 2812679 - No, two pigeons.<br />- This is Tujunga. Tujunga.
2812679 2814028 - Yeah, um...<br />- Alan: Oh, isn't there
2814028 2815421 - a gas station on Tujunga?<br />- Moorpark
2815421 2816422 - and Tujunga.<br />- Yes!
2816422 2817597 Daniel: Moorpark and Tujunga.
2817597 2818728 Alan:<br />And we're going, we're going.
2821949 2822907 Ah, damn.
2824734 2827215 [thrilling music playing]
2827694 2830218 Come on. We g...<br />We got to move.
2830218 2834396 Waze says 12 minutes<br />via Chandler and Colfax.
2837356 2838705 Thelma: Look at that.
2839053 2841926 Who created that?<br />Who thought it up?
2843101 2844842 A plug for a car.
2845320 2848410 Electricity goes through,<br />makes it run.
2849107 2852588 But what is electricity?<br />It boggles the mind.
2852588 2853763 [chuckles]
2854590 2857115 - [scoffs]<br />- Oh, I think I know her.
2860031 2862424 - Can you go a little faster?<br />- Yes, thank you.
2862424 2864557 - God. Please.<br />- I'm going the speed limit.
2865210 2867299 We are a law-abiding family.
2872347 2874175 - [seat belt clicks]<br />- Huh.
2874915 2876438 Wants me to make a left.
2877309 2879441 This is why I don't use Waze.
2879441 2881530 It wants you to make<br />all these crazy turns.
2881530 2884403 Marcy Wender's husband<br />was obsessed with Waze,
2884403 2886840 makes a psycho left,<br />ends up in Vons.
2886840 2887885 Estimates are<br />very accurate, Gail.
2887885 2889756 He paid thousands of dollars.
2889756 2891366 - Gail: No they're not.<br />- Alan: It's been proven.
2891366 2893412 Thelma: Do you know Vi?<br />Vi Friedlander?
2893934 2896154 - Maybe through Saul.<br />- Thelma: Saul?
2896502 2900375 - Gary's kid. Gary Newman?<br />- No, I don't know them.
2900898 2906077 - Oh. Did you go to Sinai?<br />- No, we were at Beth Am.
2906077 2908906 You just look so terribly<br />familiar to me.
2908906 2910516 Just have to ignore<br />all your instincts
2910516 2911734 and trust the technology.
2911734 2913911 Technology is what got us<br />into this mess
2913911 2915477 in the first place.<br />Can you go back?
2915477 2917349 - Alan: I can't go back.<br />- There's someone behind us.
2917349 2918785 - Alan: I see them.<br />- Daniel: So, go.
2918785 2920134 - I can't go.<br />- There's a gap.
2920134 2921788 - There's a...<br />- There's a gap, Alan.
2921788 2923921 - Daniel: Take it!<br />- Go, just go.
2923921 2925705 [all shouting indistinctly]
2925705 2926793 Daniel: Go. Yes, yes.
2926793 2928882 - Yes, yes, yes.<br />- Yes, yes, yes.
2928882 2930275 - [car horns honking]<br />- Okay, okay, okay.
2930275 2932712 - [shouting indistinctly]<br />- Ah!
2932712 2935454 - Yes, yes, I did.<br />- [Gail sighing]
2936411 2937978 And we're back to 12 minutes.
2938936 2940415 Gary Newman.
2940415 2942983 Ben: Oh, no.<br />My Gary is Rozelle.
2942983 2944506 Thelma:<br />Isn't that interesting?
2944506 2947031 Two different Garys,<br />but both Gary.
2947031 2949555 [music continues]
2949947 2952993 - How do you know each other?<br />- I guess we don't.
2952993 2955213 [sighs] It seemed possible.
2955213 2956605 - Alas.<br />- [chuckles]
2956605 2958129 Have a lovely day.
2958129 2962568 - You too.<br />- [chuckles, sighs]
2971533 2973057 - [Thelma gasps]<br />- Ben: What?
2975537 2976886 - What?<br />- Thelma: Oh.
2978192 2980803 - What happened?<br />- It... it's my grandson.
2982718 2985025 - Gail: Mom! Thelma!<br />- Daniel: Grandma!
2985025 2987462 Oh, it's them.<br />Come on, get out.
2989421 2990857 - Gail: Thelma!<br />- Alan and Daniel: Thelma!
2990857 2992032 Gail: Hi.<br />Have you seen a woman
2992032 2993991 with, like, white hair?<br />A real lady?
2995209 2997081 - Gail: Thelma!<br />- Alan: Thelma!
2997777 3000649 - Gail: Thelma!<br />- Alan: Thelma!
3000649 3003478 Oh, we can't make that.
3003478 3004610 Daniel: Grandma.
3004610 3005959 Alan: What's that?<br />Is that...
3005959 3007352 - Daniel: Grandma!<br />- Gail: That is interesting.
3007352 3009441 - Daniel: Oh, shit.<br />- Gail: Thelma!
3010877 3013097 - [Lyfe Line clicks, beeps]<br />- [Thelma grunts]
3013097 3014315 - Daniel: Oh, shit.<br />- Gail: What?
3014315 3015534 Her Lifeline.
3015534 3017449 Alan: What is it?<br />Do you have a location?
3017449 3019059 - Gail: What's it say?<br />- She's here.
3019059 3021018 - She's here.<br />- Ah. Where? Oh.
3025674 3028329 [Lifeline beeping]
3032899 3034857 - [beeping stops]<br />- [music calms]
3037338 3040689 [music intensifies]
3044345 3049002 [pensive music playing]
3050395 3052440 [chuckles] We are crazy.
3052440 3055226 [both laugh]
3059360 3060970 [sighs, chuckles]
3076943 3078901 Gail:<br /><i>Could it have fallen off?</i>
3079380 3080686 Not on its own.
3081469 3084124 Alan: Just to consider<br />all our options,
3084124 3086692 is it... is it possible<br />she had another TGA?
3086692 3088346 - Her behavior's erratic.<br />- I... I don't know. Yeah.
3088346 3090826 I mean, it seems<br />like it's within the realm<br />of possibility.
3090826 3092741 I'm... I'm just... I'm going<br />to Google it just to...
3092741 3094874 Daniel: I told her<br />not to take it off.
3096136 3097964 Alan: "Acute onset<br />of anterograde amnesia."
3097964 3102751 I can't remember if it was<br />on her wrist in the car.
3102751 3105493 She likes her independence<br />from that thing. She just...
3105493 3106755 Sometimes she puts it<br />in her bag.
3106755 3109802 I... I can't remember.
3109802 3112283 "...signs indicating damage<br />to a particular area..."
3112283 3113893 Daniel:<br />I should have walked her in.
3113893 3115982 It's in the past. Hmm?
3118854 3120378 Why didn't you?
3120378 3122728 - She didn't want me to.<br />- Why didn't she want you to?
3122728 3125165 - I don't know, Mom. I...<br />- Alan: Don't yell.
3125165 3128212 I'm sorry, I'm sorry,<br />I just... I'm upset.
3128212 3130083 Gail: Yeah, we're all upset.
3130779 3134218 This is exactly what<br />we have been trying to avoid,
3134653 3136698 and now my mother is at large.
3136698 3139788 I can't...<br />I can't do anything.
3139788 3143227 I literally can't do anything.<br />I'm such a little bitch.
3143749 3145751 Don't call yourself that. God.
3145751 3150147 I truly have<br />no ability to do anything.
3150147 3152671 I can't do anything<br />with my hands. I can't...
3152671 3154194 What do you want to do<br />with your hands?
3154194 3155761 I don't know. Nothing.<br />I just... I can't...
3155761 3157241 I don't know facts.
3157241 3159068 I have no qualifications<br />for any jobs.
3159068 3160418 I... I can't do math.
3160418 3162420 It's basically why Allie<br />and I aren't together.
3162420 3166163 Because you couldn't do math?<br />I thought she could do math.
3166163 3168469 It's just another thing<br />that I can't do.
3168469 3170167 I haven't done the I.D.
3170167 3172081 because every time<br />I go on the computer,
3172081 3174432 I get all confused<br />by the stupid website
3174432 3176608 and all the classifications
3176608 3178523 and the... and the...<br />and the terms.
3178523 3180873 Do you have visual,<br />uh, what's it?
3180873 3184355 - Processing.<br />- Processing issues?
3184920 3187358 Sure. Or maybe I'm just<br />a stupid little bitch
3187358 3188924 - who can't do anything.<br />- Don't say "bitch."
3188924 3190012 - Stop.<br />- Stop saying "bitch."
3190012 3192363 I lost Grandma. Fuck!
3194756 3198238 [both sigh]
3210903 3212513 Ben:<br />Think we're getting closer?
3221392 3223742 - Thelma?<br />- Hang on.
3224699 3227093 - What is it?<br />- I don't know where we are.
3227093 3228616 Ben: Oh, don't say that.
3228616 3231097 Thelma: I thought<br />we were heading north.
3233012 3234753 I'm gonna go find help.
3234753 3238626 Oh, no, Ben, give me a moment.<br />Let me orient myself.
3239105 3240802 [scoffs] Ben.
3241673 3242891 [sighs]
3243762 3246199 Ben, don't make a scene.
3246199 3249289 You don't listen to me, Thel.<br />You don't listen to anybody.
3249550 3253467 If I listened to you,<br />I'd be your roommate by now.
3253467 3255252 Go home, Ben.<br />You don't want to be here.
3255252 3258777 - We should call your family.<br />- Out of the question.
3258777 3260692 - What about your grandson?<br />- Thelma: No.
3260692 3261910 - No.<br />- Why?
3261910 3264478 Because I'm not like you, Ben.
3264478 3268482 As much as you may want me<br />to be, I like to be useful.
3269048 3271268 We're more alike<br />than you think.
3271268 3273095 What's that supposed to mean?
3273095 3274445 We're old.
3275750 3276925 Diminished.
3277404 3279841 We're a liability<br />to the ones we love.
3280451 3282279 You can tell<br />yourself different,
3282888 3285282 but you know<br />that they're worried sick.
3285760 3287501 What's to worry about?
3287501 3290939 I move from point to point.<br />I don't complain.
3290939 3294116 I am the same.<br />And you would be, too,
3294116 3296205 if you stopped feeling sorry<br />for yourself.
3296205 3298120 It doesn't work that way.
3298120 3300340 You start acting like a baby,<br />people treat you like a baby.
3300340 3301559 Bullshit.
3303125 3305780 You know how I know?<br />Because I couldn't...
3306128 3308174 I couldn't hear her<br />when she fell.
3314441 3316269 We're not what we were.
3320360 3321883 We're the only ones left.
3322928 3325496 The least we can do<br />is take care of each other.
3328977 3330892 Call your family.
3334809 3338465 I don't need them.<br />I don't need you.
3338465 3341816 I just needed your scooter.<br />[gasps]
3344732 3346386 - [Thelma gasping]<br />- [engine revs]
3346386 3350259 - [tires screech]<br />- [debris clattering]
3350782 3354176 [tires squeal, engine revving]
3356222 3358659 [scoffs] We were stopped.
3358659 3360487 Did you put<br />the parking brake on?
3360835 3363229 I didn't know there was one.
3363229 3366363 I didn't know.<br />I... I'm sorry, Ben.
3366972 3368626 You're not sorry.
3368626 3370932 [somber music playing]
3370932 3373326 Ben, where are you going?
3377156 3378984 I'm not waiting!
3380812 3382030 [grunts softly]
3392737 3394913 Gail:<br /><i>We've all lost her before.</i>
3395566 3397481 I've lost her at Gelson's<br />a few times.
3397916 3399483 The woman likes<br />to keep moving.
3399483 3401223 Especially<br />if she has that cart.
3401659 3403008 When she sets her mind<br />to something,
3403008 3404052 there's no stopping her.
3404052 3405793 She doesn't eat,<br />she doesn't sleep.
3405793 3408709 She just, like,<br />keeps that laser focus...
3408709 3410929 - Hmm.<br />- ...till the task is done.
3410929 3412670 This is different<br />than Gelson's.
3412670 3414149 Alan: Well, I'm aware<br />it's different.
3414149 3415455 But she's a grown woman
3415455 3417457 who's a little faster<br />than you would hope.
3417936 3419633 And you can't<br />be responsible for her
3419633 3421418 every second of every day.
3421418 3423028 We shouldn't have<br />put that on you.
3423028 3424290 It was too much.
3424638 3427075 I know that<br />she's not gonna live forever.
3428903 3431819 But I just... when it happens,
3431819 3436737 I want it to be not horrific,<br />you know?
3438739 3440785 Like, a good death.
3442221 3443788 There is no good death.
3448096 3449489 [Gail speaking quietly]
3449489 3450795 I'm gonna take a walk.
3450795 3452144 Oh, can we go with you?
3452144 3454276 - I'll go with him.<br />- I want to go with him.
3454276 3456888 No, no, no, no, I'm...<br />I want to go alone.
3456888 3458455 I just need a little, um...
3459064 3460544 - space to think.<br />- Where are you walking?
3460544 3462328 - Where are you gonna go?<br />- I don't know, just...
3462328 3464286 Do you... do you have<br />your phone on you?
3464722 3466071 Gail: Please don't keep it<br />on silent.
3466071 3467768 - No. Here. Take...<br />- Can you do that for me?
3467768 3469727 - ...take this.<br />- For my mental health?
3469727 3471119 I'm gonna be close. It's fine.
3471119 3474383 - Just... It's fully charged.<br />- Daniel: Okay.
3474383 3476168 Alan:<br />And it just snaps on here.
3476690 3477822 There we go.
3478779 3481521 Have a nice walk. I love you.
3481521 3482653 I love you, too.
3483828 3488528 [suspenseful music playing]
3490487 3492793 [footsteps approaching]
3493446 3496231 [pants]
3512683 3515381 [cardiac monitor beeping]
3547500 3550938 [indistinct chatter over TV]
3559077 3560774 [Thelma gasps, groans]
3580751 3582970 [Thelma groans]
3586713 3590848 [groans] Oh. Oh.
3591588 3592676 Oh.
3594242 3598638 [groans, sobs]
3602555 3605776 - [car engine revving]<br />- [tires screeching]
3605776 3609518 [pensive music playing]
3609954 3612609 [whimpers]
3619311 3622096 [groans]
3625056 3626231 Oh.
3632890 3635240 [high-pitched beep]
3635240 3636720 [beep fades]
3675846 3679371 [gentle music playing]
3746090 3747265 [high-pitched beep]
3750616 3751704 Ah.
3752487 3753662 [sighs]
3754098 3755490 Thank you.
3756013 3757144 You're welcome.
3758842 3762149 I'm sorry. About all of it.
3763368 3765718 But we gave it a good try,<br />didn't we?
3766980 3768329 Yes, we did.
3769591 3770723 [sniffles]
3772943 3777599 I lived with my parents<br />till I was 23. [sniffles]
3777599 3779384 Then I moved in with Teddy...
3780428 3783431 and I lived with him<br />until I was 91.
3784606 3788436 I've lived just me<br />for two years now.
3789742 3791918 Gets lonely sometimes.
3794573 3796096 And I miss Teddy.
3799056 3803016 But I... I tried sushi,<br />and I liked that quite a bit.
3807586 3809806 I've enjoyed my time alone.
3813810 3815986 I guess I wanted more of it.
3822557 3824472 [vehicle approaching]
3826083 3827998 I think I know her.
3829260 3831915 - Lois?<br />- Thelma!
3833655 3834656 [chuckles]
3834961 3837311 We just saw <i>Swan Lake.</i>
3837311 3840488 And it was set<br />during the Korean War,
3840488 3843187 so the dancers were<br />all dressed like soldiers.
3843187 3845189 I... I don't know<br />that I understood it,
3845189 3850063 but it was beautifully staged.<br />I think it was very political.
3850063 3852849 - Sounds interesting.<br />- Lois: It was, yes.
3853110 3854720 So, where can we take you?
3854720 3858202 Oh. Just home.<br />Ben, what's your address?
3858202 3862423 We're heading<br />to 1534 San Fernando Road.
3862423 3864948 [mellow music playing<br />over radio]
3864948 3868038 Well, we've come this far.<br />We might as well finish it.
3868038 3869866 Well, what about your show?
3870605 3874696 There is no show<br />without Daddy Warbucks.
3876089 3877612 [chuckles]
3877917 3881616 [intriguing music playing]
3882617 3883836 [thud]
3896631 3898068 [bell dings]
3902376 3903421 [sighs]
3908905 3910167 Twenty-one.
3911908 3914432 - What now?<br />- We wait.
3915302 3917043 - Allie: [over cellphone] <i>Hi.</i><br />- Daniel: <i>Hey.</i>
3917043 3919959 Thanks for picking up. Um...
3920829 3925269 Are you slinging those<br />crunchy-crunchy tiki tacos?
3925922 3928925 Yeah. Yeah, that's why<br />they pay me the big bucks.
3929708 3931362 How's it going with you?
3931710 3932972 Daniel: [over cellphone] <i>Okay.</i>
3933407 3935279 Um, bad, actually.
3936497 3938325 My grandma's missing,
3938325 3941111 <i>and I'm camped out<br />at an old folks' home</i>
3941111 3943548 <i>- with my parents.</i><br />- Wait, what? How?
3943548 3945593 She went to visit a friend,
3945593 3947334 and then they went<br />missing together.
3947334 3949119 <i>It's been a couple hours<br />so far.</i>
3949119 3950990 <i>I mean, the whole thing<br />is just... I don't know,<br />it's...</i>
3950990 3952818 They didn't sign out<br />or anything,
3952818 3954602 but I was supposed<br />to watch her, so...
3954602 3959651 Okay, well, uh, could she have<br />just gone somewhere
3959651 3960869 without telling you guys?
3960869 3962219 Daniel:<br /><i>That's what we thought.</i>
3962219 3963829 We thought it could be<br />a Souplantation situation.
3963829 3965222 Allie: [over cellphone]<br /><i>A... a what?</i>
3965222 3967833 No, nothing. I mean,<br />it's possible, I guess.
3967833 3969748 Well, I only asked<br />because she's...
3970705 3973012 obsessed with errands, right?
3973012 3975884 Well, yeah. She has<br />a healthy respect for errands.
3976320 3978017 Well, I know<br />you really love her.
3978017 3980237 I'm sure you're<br />super worried, but...
3980672 3984676 Maybe she's just<br />doing something.
3985111 3987809 <i>You know? On her own.</i>
3988332 3989724 Yeah.
3989724 3991422 [soft music playing]
3991422 3992640 I hope so.
3994338 3996644 <i>Hey, I've also<br />been wanting to call you.</i>
3996644 3999517 <i>I was thinking about<br />taking some classes,</i>
3999517 4001432 maybe an adult math class,
4001432 4005088 or, like, just brush up on...<br />on some of those essentials.
4005088 4007046 - What are you talking about?<br />- Daniel: <i>Self-improvement.</i>
4007046 4009527 I'm just saying I...<br />I can learn to do more things,
4009527 4012834 adding and subtracting,<br />uh, fractals.
4012834 4015881 Like, I can take the great<br />leap from boy to man.
4015881 4017491 You're driving me nuts,<br />do you know that?
4017491 4021017 [laughs] I do. I...<br />I do know that, very much.
4022061 4024150 Sorry.<br />It's so freaking hot in here.
4024150 4026457 Okay, well, go for a walk.
4026457 4028372 My folks asked me<br />to stay close.
4028850 4030374 [Allie chuckles]
4030374 4032637 <i>Well, if you ever take<br />that great leap,</i>
4033377 4036510 for what it's worth,<br />I think you could make it.
4038643 4040819 - Oh, my God!<br />- Allie: <i>What?</i>
4040819 4044475 [whispers]<br />Um, there's, uh, been a guy<br />in here the whole time.
4046216 4049697 Thelma: We used to call bread<br />the staff of life.
4050785 4053788 But now nobody wants<br />to eat bread.
4055051 4058315 But there are delicious breads<br />being made now.
4058315 4060099 It's a conundrum.
4060099 4062623 And some people like toast<br />with toppings.
4062623 4064408 Mm. Interesting.
4065235 4067889 The way we think about bread<br />has changed, so.
4068281 4071806 You want bread?<br />We've got bread.
4072590 4074331 - There you go.<br />- [Thelma chuckles softly]
4078770 4081077 - Ugh!<br />- [groans, spits]
4081381 4083688 - Oh, it's like a rock.<br />- I couldn't even chew it.
4084167 4085211 [grunts]
4087648 4088910 [bell dings]
4088910 4092218 [intriguing music playing]
4100357 4102794 - Can you see him?<br />- Ben: That's him.
4108321 4110062 Ah, he's coming out.
4114458 4115589 [door opening]
4117722 4119115 Oh, come on.
4119898 4121421 - [grunts]<br />- [Ben grunts]
4158328 4159807 You keep a lookout.
4160286 4163463 Uh, I'm gonna go in<br />and try to talk to them.
4163985 4167163 If things get funny,<br />you go for help.
4167163 4170340 - How will I know?<br />- Well, you'll be with me.
4171036 4172516 [cellphone beeping]
4173343 4175345 Automated Voice:<br /><i>Microphone enabled.</i>
4178043 4179436 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
4180001 4182221 [suspenseful music playing]
4200196 4201414 Thelma: Hello?
4202328 4204852 Ben: [over hearing aid]<br /><i>Thel, I think I see a door<br />in the back.</i>
4216037 4218562 <i>Lamp down ahead.<br />Lift those heels.</i>
4225308 4227440 <i>There's a stack<br />of loose Hummels, or...</i>
4227440 4228833 <i>or maybe they're gnomes</i>
4228833 4231488 <i>or some kind of<br />little animals.</i>
4231488 4232793 <i>Be... be careful.</i>
4242107 4243717 <i>Gets a little hairy up ahead.</i>
4244065 4245328 Take your time.
4251247 4252509 - [shattering]<br />- Oh!
4253379 4254554 Ben: <i>What happened?</i>
4254989 4257731 Oh. W... what are you doing?
4257731 4259298 Thelma: It's a mess.
4260299 4261822 Don't clean!
4261822 4264564 Thelma: Well, you have to<br />with glass. It's not right.
4264564 4267741 Ben: <i>Not now.<br />Get your act together.</i>
4274966 4277577 <i>- Easy, easy.</i><br />- Thelma: Ah.
4280798 4286238 Uh, yes! Ah!<br />Well done. Well done, Thel.
4286717 4288240 <i>Okay. Let's go.</i>
4290111 4291287 Harvey: Yes, sir.
4292026 4294246 Hesitating is gonna cost you.
4294899 4296422 Yeah, quite a bit.
4297336 4301035 No, there's gonna be<br />some unpleasantness ahead.
4301035 4303429 I mean, we just don't want him<br />sitting in holding
4303429 4305388 any longer than he has to.
4305388 4308739 Yes, I know, but even<br />good boys make mistakes.
4308739 4310697 [beads jangling]
4310697 4312699 [radio playing indistinctly]
4316703 4319402 - Hi. May I help you?<br />- Who's that?
4319402 4322970 I'm Thelma. Thelma Post.
4324537 4325712 Huh.
4325712 4327714 You might recognize me.
4329063 4330674 From the telephone.
4331327 4335287 Hmm. No, I can't say<br />I do, ma'am.
4336027 4338029 Uh, at this moment in time,<br />we're closed.
4338029 4339465 But why don't you<br />come back tomorrow?
4339465 4341598 I've got a shipment of, uh,<br />what do you call them?
4341598 4344383 A woman inside a woman<br />inside a woman.
4344383 4347038 - Uh, Russian nesting dolls?<br />- Yeah.
4347038 4350128 Now, at least<br />I think they're women.<br />I mean, I haven't checked.
4350128 4352522 There may be a little fella<br />in there somewhere. [chuckles]
4352522 4354045 Where's my money?
4358441 4360399 - Sorry?<br />- You heard me.
4360399 4363359 Yes, I heard you.<br />I'm not sure I understood.
4363968 4365361 You called me.
4365970 4368233 You pretended<br />to be my grandson.
4369060 4371192 You took advantage of me.
4371192 4374674 [tense music playing]
4387557 4389646 That's a hefty accusation.
4390081 4392083 I think you've got<br />the wrong idea.
4392953 4396000 Listen, buddy,<br />I came a long way.
4397218 4399307 Hm,<br />well, you've made a mistake.
4399612 4402310 That's okay. You know,<br />I make mistakes, too.
4402310 4404878 But let's not make another.
4405444 4407620 [handbag rustling]
4408621 4411319 I'm... I'm contacting<br />the authorities.
4411319 4413409 [line ringing]
4416890 4418457 Well, what are you<br />gonna tell 'em?
4418457 4420024 You broke into my store?
4420024 4421547 Operator: [over cellphone]<br /><i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>
4421547 4423941 I'd like to report a robbery.<br />Ah! Uh, uh...
4423941 4425682 [cellphone beeps, chimes]
4425682 4426944 The... Thel?
4428424 4430121 Thel, are you there?
4430121 4433429 Look, I just want you to know<br />that it's not personal.
4433907 4436780 I mean, we're not<br />selling like we used to.
4436780 4438477 People these days, they...
4438477 4440523 they don't care<br />about old things.
4441001 4443526 I'm just trying<br />to keep the lights on.
4443526 4444962 We have a lot of lights.
4446137 4449662 - So, it's very expensive.<br />- Yeah. Thank you, Michael.
4451098 4454101 I bet this whole thing<br />has been a headache, huh?
4454101 4457670 Look, I don't expect you<br />to leave here empty-handed.
4458366 4460325 Why don't we make a deal, huh?
4460325 4461805 I'll keep your deposit,
4461805 4463807 but I'll cut you in<br />on the next one.
4464242 4466462 Yeah, I'm happy to negotiate.
4466462 4468159 I'll give you<br />the senior discount.
4468159 4470466 Well, that isn't gonna work<br />for me.
4471467 4472816 And you should know,
4472816 4474948 if I'm not out<br />in five minutes,
4474948 4477298 my partner calls the cops.
4478604 4479866 You want me to beg?
4481433 4482695 Then I'll beg.
4483914 4485263 - [grunts]<br />- [Thelma gasps]
4488092 4490877 Harvey: Look, what do you<br />want me to do?
4490877 4492226 Give it back?
4492226 4494533 I'll lose the store.<br />I'll be out on the street.
4495316 4496753 Nobody cares.
4498145 4500017 Nobody cares about me.
4500539 4503194 Everybody's buying<br />their shit on Amazon.
4504021 4506545 I just take<br />what I need to survive.
4507067 4509548 So, why do you need it so bad?
4509548 4513378 Because it's mine,<br />and I decide who gets it.
4515336 4517034 You're being unreasonable.
4519253 4521429 Michael, get my keys.
4524476 4526086 - [Thelma groans]<br />- [grunts]
4526826 4528262 Ah...
4529655 4531831 Uh, uh...
4531831 4533877 - Huh?<br />- No, no. I, uh...
4533877 4536183 Thelma: How did I... huh.
4536749 4540144 Uh, I, uh... oh. Ah.
4540492 4543190 I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
4543190 4546542 I... I don't recognize<br />this pla...
4547151 4549240 Oh. I, uh...
4550284 4554462 I... I need to call<br />my husband.
4556334 4557988 Hm. Of course.
4558597 4560077 What's your name, dear?
4560077 4562166 - I'm Harvey.<br />- Harvey?
4562601 4565735 - Harvey: Yeah.<br />- Harvey? Harvey.
4565735 4566953 Harvey: Come and sit down now.
4566953 4568085 Harvey.
4568085 4569303 Harvey: We'll call him.<br />Yeah, yeah.
4569303 4571436 Talk to me, Thel.<br />What's going on?
4577094 4579836 I'm terribly sorry<br />for the imposition.
4579836 4581664 [scoffs] Oh, please.<br />It's all right.
4581664 4583753 No. Happens to the best of us.
4583753 4585493 The mind is a funny thing.
4585493 4586756 Now,<br />what's your husband's number?
4586756 4588366 - I'll get you home.<br />- [gun cocking]
4589672 4592152 [music intensifies]
4592892 4594633 My money, Harvey.
4597288 4599638 Michael! Coward.
4599638 4601597 [thrilling music playing]
4602510 4603816 [glass shattering]
4611432 4612825 [Ben grunts]
4617656 4620311 Thelma: You were<br />very convincing, Harvey.
4620311 4622095 Why, you could have<br />been an actor.
4622095 4625359 Not a star, maybe,<br />but even so, what a waste.
4625359 4627100 Do you know<br />how to use that thing?
4627710 4629755 - No.<br />- [gunshot]
4629755 4633498 Fuck! Jesus Christ!<br />Okay, okay, okay.
4633498 4634673 Where is it?
4636544 4638590 - In there.<br />- Where?
4638590 4641680 It's been deposited into<br />my account on the computer.
4641680 4643856 - Well, get it out.<br />- I can't.
4643856 4646554 - What do you mean, you can't?<br />- Michael does the computers.
4646554 4649427 Oh, this is ridiculous. Oh.
4655476 4658610 It's just me and you now.<br />[chuckles]
4659350 4660612 Ben: And me.
4661831 4664660 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- My friend.
4665443 4670274 Here. Here, you take this.<br />I... I need both hands.
4670709 4673669 - What happened to Michael?<br />- I beat him up.
4674582 4678151 Where's the mouse?<br />There's the mouse.
4678804 4680327 Come on. Move.
4684636 4687595 What? What is that?<br />It's a shoe!
4687595 4689423 - It looks like a shoe.<br />- It's a shoe.
4689423 4691730 Ben, don't look at it.<br />Look at him.
4692122 4695299 W... what do I do with it?<br />I... I'm gonna "X" it.
4695299 4696648 No, no, don't do that!
4696648 4698563 Well, you don't know<br />what it is.
4701697 4702828 [mouse clicking]
4706789 4708399 That's a baby.
4709661 4713230 Oh, God.<br />I don't know how to do this.

4722935 4723980 Hello?
4723980 4724981 Thelma: [over cellphone]<br /><i>Danny?</i>
4724981 4726852 Grandma! Oh, my God.
4726852 4729812 Are you... okay?<br />Where are you?
4729812 4731509 Thelma: <i>I'll tell you,</i>
4731509 4733554 <i>but you have to promise me<br />something.</i>
4733554 4734599 What?
4734599 4735948 Thelma: <i>Come alone.</i>
4737123 4740257 [intriguing music playing]
4741693 4743347 - [Gail sighs]<br />- [cellphone vibrates]
4746785 4747917 - Alan: Huh.<br />- Gail: What?
4749135 4750528 His heart rate is slowing.
4750876 4753270 [thrilling music playing]
4753270 4754619 We're getting closer.
4754619 4756316 - Yeah, yeah. [groans]<br />- We're getting closer.
4756316 4758144 I just... okay,<br />now a little more,
4758144 4759972 little more, little more.<br />Ah! Ah!
4764498 4767023 [suspenseful music playing]
4768546 4770896 [car engine revving]
4775771 4777816 [tires screech]
4777816 4780558 [thrilling music playing]
4780558 4782212 Tell me<br />what you're looking at!
4782212 4785693 It... it's a family<br />and a baby,<br />and they're everywhere.
4785693 4787173 Daniel: [over cellphone]<br /><i>Great, great. Are there words?</i>
4787173 4789785 Thelma: Yeah, it says,<br />uh, Lincoln Mutual.
4789785 4793005 Yep! It's an ad.<br />You need to find the "X."
4793005 4796052 - Well, there's no red "X."<br />- No, but it's not always red.
4796052 4798576 Sometimes they hide it,<br />so look closer.
4801753 4803015 Top right.
4809065 4812372 - I "X"ed it.<br />- Daniel: Great! Um...
4813025 4815549 - [cellphone vibrates]<br />- Daniel: Remember the...
4815549 4817247 the computer's the library,
4817247 4819118 and the search bar's<br />the librarian.
4819118 4821860 <i>You're gonna ask it<br />for information,</i>
4821860 4823296 <i>and then it's gonna<br />give it to you.</i>
4823601 4824950 Thelma: [over cellphone]<br /><i>Where is the bank?</i>
4824950 4827170 Ye... uh,<br />are you talking to me?
4827170 4829520 No, I... I'm asking<br />the machine.
4829520 4831217 It can't hear you.
4831217 4833916 Is there a Sari or a Siri,<br />or is she not in there?
4833916 4835613 She's not there.<br />That... that's in your phone.
4835613 4836657 But y... you don't need her.
4836657 4837876 Thelma: <i>I don't talk to her.</i>
4837876 4839182 <i>She talks to me.</i>
4849757 4851194 "Valley...

4861204 4862379 Thelma: I'm in!
4875348 4876784 What's the password?
4876784 4878090 I don't know.
4878090 4881267 Look around you.<br />Is there, uh, a notebook
4881267 4884314 <i>or a desk, papers,<br />anything like that?</i>
4887143 4889449 - Oh, my God.<br />- Daniel: <i>What?</i>
4889449 4891451 The password is "Password."
4891451 4893018 Daniel: <i>Classic!</i>
4893018 4895542 Now, click inside of that box<br />and type that in.
4896935 4898371 [chuckles] That's cute.
4898371 4901505 Goddamn dumbass.<br />Password, Michael?
4908947 4910296 Come on!
4910775 4912603 [car horn honks]
4912603 4914866 I'm moving to "Transfer."
4916433 4918391 Oh, God.
4918391 4921742 - What?<br />- It wants me to join a gym!
4923135 4925007 No, I... I'm gonna tell it no.
4925007 4926965 Good. Remember what we do?
4926965 4929228 The "X," no matter the color.
4929228 4930577 Daniel: <i>That's right!</i>
4933406 4935539 - I'm in.<br />- Yes!
4935539 4937062 Thelma: <i>Be ready in five.</i>
4937062 4938324 Okay, I'll be there soon.
4940413 4942198 [keyboard clacking]
4944983 4947507 [sighs] Oh, Jesus.
4967788 4969007 [objects clattering]
4969442 4971879 [music fades]
4973185 4974752 Harvey: Uh, no! Oof.
4975492 4978234 - [gasping]<br />- [air hissing]
4985763 4988070 I assume it was you
4988070 4990420 on the phone<br />pretending to be Danny.
4991987 4993989 He doesn't have the range.
4996382 4997949 I'm not your grandma.
4999690 5002084 But if I was, I'd tell you<br />there comes a time
5002084 5005304 when you can't listen<br />to anyone but yourself.
5005304 5008394 [pensive music playing]
5013530 5015749 He called you a dumbass.
5017012 5019492 He said it quietly,<br />but I heard it.
5037075 5039991 Ah! [breathes deeply]
5040383 5042167 You're insane.
5043647 5045170 [sighing heavily]
5055833 5058314 - Is that it?<br />- That's it.
5059271 5060968 And he can't get it back?
5063710 5065408 [breathes heavily]
5071457 5072980 Hey, wait!
5075635 5079726 [breathes heavily]<br />He can't get it back.
5085602 5087691 Don't take people's money.
5088518 5090041 Clean up your store.
5091042 5092783 Be nicer to Michael.
5093827 5097353 This whole thing<br />has been really ridiculous.
5099137 5102358 [sighs] And don't smoke.
5104490 5108103 [dramatic music playing]
5125250 5127600 - What?<br />- I didn't say anything.
5127600 5128645 Oh.
5130864 5134129 - [car engine roaring]<br />- [tires screech]
5134129 5135434 Get in!
5135434 5139221 [soft music playing]
5147490 5148795 Did you get it?
5151842 5153060 We got it.
5154845 5156977 - [laughs]<br />- [chuckles softly]
5156977 5159371 Oh, Danny, Danny,<br />you remember Ben.
5159371 5161808 Yeah. Hey, Ben,<br />it's really great to see you.
5161808 5163419 Ben: Good to see, Danny.<br />How you doing?
5163419 5166726 - Daniel: I'm all right. Yeah.<br />- [emergency alert blaring]
5168511 5172863 Ben: Whoa. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.<br />We're famous.
5173342 5175300 - Ha, ha! [chuckles]<br />- [Thelma chuckles]
5175300 5176562 Hello!
5180827 5183874 Today was a good day.
5183874 5186093 I hope you know<br />I'm gonna buy you
5186093 5188313 a new scooter and a new phone.
5188313 5191621 Oh, well, maybe we can go out<br />to lunch someday.
5191621 5192883 Thelma: I'd like that.
5192883 5196234 We could try<br />the famous Belwood cafeteria.
5196234 5198105 I hear they have<br />terrific melons.
5198105 5200499 [both laugh]
5200499 5204199 - Or... we could go out.<br />- Both good options.
5204764 5207811 - We'll make a plan, dear.<br />- Good, good, good.
5207811 5210466 - [chuckles]<br />- Ben: Ah!
5213077 5214992 - You be well.<br />- I will.
5220650 5222042 Break a leg, Ben!
5225045 5226308 [Thelma chuckles]
5227439 5229615 Does he know what that means?
5229615 5231008 I'm not sure.
5231791 5236361 He's new to the theater,<br />and his hip is titanium.
5237057 5238494 Detective Morgan:<br />But he didn't say anything?
5238494 5241018 Gail: No, but he... he...
5241018 5243238 Has Daniel ever wandered off<br />like this before?
5243238 5245152 Gail: Never. Not like this.
5247851 5250462 Oh, my God! Mom! Oh!
5252116 5253813 Your eye. Are you okay?
5253813 5255598 I'm all right, darling.<br />I'm all right.
5255598 5257817 Gail: Oh, we were so worried<br />about you!
5258253 5259602 Ah!
5267523 5269916 [smacks lips, sighs]
5271135 5272310 You drove.
5273180 5274225 I did.
5275966 5277924 You went back to the buffet.
5278751 5279883 [chuckles]
5280753 5282320 [chuckles softly]
5282320 5283321 I did.
5283321 5285323 - What happened?<br />- [chuckles]
5285323 5287412 Well,<br />I'll tell you everything,
5287412 5289240 but there's something<br />I'd like to do first,
5289240 5290763 if you would indulge me.
5290763 5291895 Of course!
5292678 5295377 I'm just Annie,<br />Mr. Warbucks, sir.
5295377 5297770 I'm sorry I'm not a... a boy.
5297770 5300033 Resident: It's her<br />first night here, sir.
5300033 5303210 Well, Annie, how would you<br />like to go to a movie?
5304386 5307650 And then you could go<br />to The Roxy
5307650 5313569 and then some ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's,
5313569 5317573 and then a cab ride<br />around Central Park.
5322273 5323622 Um, well...
5325581 5326712 Yeah, wow.
5327452 5330542 Golly. Golly, Daddy,<br />Mr. Warbucks.
5331717 5333893 - It's a strange show!<br />- [shushes]
5333893 5337244 [birds chirping]

5373063 5374238 [Thelma chuckles]
5387120 5389340 [music fades]
5389732 5391516 I'm glad to come here.
5393736 5395477 These are good graves.
5396782 5398044 Do you like them?
5398044 5399437 Yeah. As in, what?
5399437 5400786 Do I want to be buried<br />in them?
5400786 5403441 [chuckles]<br />I got a ton of graves.
5403441 5404964 Oh, yeah?
5405661 5407271 Beautiful graves.
5408011 5409229 Some here.
5410317 5412319 Mostly back in New York.
5413103 5417237 Uh, does Allie plan on being<br />buried in a Jewish cemetery?
5417237 5418630 Oh, I don't know, you know?
5418630 5420980 We haven't really had<br />the graves conversation yet.
5420980 5422373 - [chuckles]<br />- Taking it slow.
5423418 5425332 Oh, we may have enough.
5429598 5431295 You get very greedy.
5432601 5434559 You want to see<br />what's gonna happen
5434559 5435952 to those you love.
5438302 5440652 [gentle music playing]
5441000 5442262 I love you.
5443133 5446658 And if you ever do die,
5446658 5448486 I'm really, really, really<br />gonna miss you.
5448486 5451533 And I know you know that,<br />but I just, uh...
5452098 5455754 I wanted to say that<br />while we're here.
5456494 5457626 While we're here.
5461456 5463066 Wherever I go...
5464763 5466852 I'm not gonna worry about you.
5469072 5471161 You're gonna be okay, Danny.

5494663 5497753 I mean, look how gnarled<br />they are, and yet they live.
5497753 5499189 - Look.<br />- I'm looking.
5499189 5500233 Thelma: You should be taking
5500233 5501539 - photographs of this.<br />- [laughs]

5503498 5504629 Daniel: It's incredible.

5511201 5512985 It should be down<br />on the ground.
5512985 5514987 Thelma: But it's unbelievable.
5514987 5516902 [laughs] It's crazy!
