82473 84301 Yeah, but who needs it?
84301 85911 What's an inbox?
85911 88479 It's where, um, where<br />all your emails are stored.

156199 158636 -Wow.<br />-That's Cruise.
158636 160421 Terrific.
160899 164599 - You got big plans tonight?<br />- Eh, just dinging around.
166035 168080 You spoken to Allie?
168080 169604 We're still on a break.
169604 172346 I'm just, you know, trying<br />to give her a little space,
172346 174913 and... I'm just not<br />really sure
174913 176219 what my selling points<br />are at the moment.
176219 177394 -Oh,
177394 179657 well, you're<br />a wonderful grandson.
179657 182617 You know computers.<br />You have your hair.
182617 184271 I think it's gonna start<br />to go early.
184271 186011 Well, you can't<br />get hung up on that.
186011 189101 Yeah. We're just in different<br />places as people, you know?
189101 190755 She... she thinks I'm stuck.
191887 193715 You're too young to be stuck.
194542 195847 I don't feel young.
196370 198110 Well, I don't feel old.
198110 199938 - Oy.<br />- "Oy" is right.
201853 205857 You're gonna land<br />on your feet. Like Cruise.
207729 210340 Who is it they say<br />lands on their feet?
210340 211385 I think cats.
211385 212734 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
212734 214518 But I guess in a way,<br />it could be about both.
214518 215476 Mm.
215737 217217 Do you want this?
217608 220307 It's a marble.<br />I got a ton of these.
220307 221830 Sure.
221830 224311 How about some pretzels?<br />I got a ton of pretzels.
224311 225616 Only if, yeah,<br />you don't need them.
225616 227401 No, I can't chew them.
227401 229925 What... Could you please<br />just wear this when I go?
229925 231927 - Ugh, I'm fine.<br />- I know you are.
231927 233320 You... you...<br />you probably won't need it,
233320 235104 but I'll just feel better<br />if you wear it, okay?
235104 236453 What's the point?
236453 238368 - If I fall, I'm toast.<br />-Come on.
238368 239891 That's why<br />I don't fall.
239891 241241 Don't say that, please.
241937 244287 - For my mental health?
244287 245680 Okay.

607694 609304 <i>My mother got a call</i>
609304 610610 from Daniel,<br />and apparently he's in jail.
610610 611872 Someone broke his nose.
611872 613351 Who told her that?
613351 614918 <i>She spoke to him.<br />She spoke to Daniel.</i>
614918 616920 And then I tried calling him<br />and I can't get him.
616920 618530 And he's not picking up<br />his phone?
618530 620358 No. I'm gonna try him again.
620358 622273 <i>Okay. I'm getting in the car.</i>
622273 623971 Uh, let me know what you hear.
631369 632414 Hello?
632936 636679 And he was going on and on<br />about how you hit someone,
636679 638507 and it was worse<br />than you think.
638507 642076 - And she was pregnant and...<br />- I hit a pregnant woman?
642076 643251 Like, I struck her<br />with my fist?
643251 644818 Oh, no, no, no,<br />it was a car accident.
644818 646471 No, yeah, this was all happening<br />inside of a car.
646471 648430 Oh. Okay, well, that...<br />Yeah, that makes more sense.
648430 650388 Well, what are you<br />talking about?
650388 652652 No, I misunderstood.
652652 654262 Why weren't you picking up<br />your phone?
654262 655437 I was asleep.
655437 657352 At 10:30?<br />I called you at 10:30.
657352 658745 And then... and then...
658745 660398 Yeah, but I went out<br />last night with some friends.
660398 662749 - You didn't drive, did you?<br />- Um...
662749 665926 Did you get drunk? You know,<br />alcohol is a major depressant.
665926 667754 It's... Wendy Horowitz's son
667754 669103 is completely hooked<br />on Don Julio.
669103 671540 - Don Julio.<br />- He's... He can't hold a job.
671540 672759 He's in and out of rehabs.
672759 675152 He's...<br />Has no sense of agency.
675152 676719 -And he vapes.<br />-He vapes.
676719 679374 He's completely lost,<br />and he may never find himself.
679374 680723 Are you paying attention?
680723 683552 - Yes, I understand.<br />- Do you?
683552 684988 Yeah. I mean,<br />it's... it's an issue.
685554 688644 Mom, did you really think<br />it was Daniel?
688644 690385 I mean, how did you think<br />this was real?
690385 691995 Mom, you thought<br />it was real, too.
691995 693736 Well, she was very convincing.
693736 695129 Well, she was scared,<br />your mother.
695129 696608 - I was sc...<br />- We were all scared.
696608 699220 I wasn't quite as scared,<br />just for the record.
699220 701875 We'll see what happens<br />when you get a call, buddy.
701875 705095 I wouldn't be fooled.<br />My mind is sharp as a tack.
705095 706357 What?
706357 707402 I said I wouldn't be fooled.
707402 708838 My mind is sharp as a tack.
709578 711841 - What's he saying?<br />- He's making a joke.
711841 713408 - Oh.<br />- You want to try it again?
713408 714757 - What's the joke, Alan?<br />- Never mind.
714757 716498 - Never mind.<br />-It wasn't a joke.
716498 717891 - Never mind.<br />- Well, you know,
717891 719153 it was a close call, but...
720415 721416 it's over now.
721808 722765 Everything's okay.
724114 725725 I am so embarrassed.
725725 727378 - No.<br />- Don't be. You're home.
727378 728989 You're safe.<br />That's all that matters.
729772 731252 But I sent the money.
733471 734646 Oh.
739782 740914 You're speeding, Danny.
743568 745396 Well, we could report<br />a tracking number
745396 748051 if it's with Western Union,<br />FedEx, UPS.
748051 749792 With a letter,<br />our only real option
749792 751228 is to contact<br />the postal service,
751228 753665 and with these types<br />of things, the odds are slim,
753665 755015 especially without<br />the address.
755015 756712 I think I have it here.
756712 758496 Aw, it's such a mean<br />thing to do. It's just sick.
758496 759802 Isn't there anything<br />that can be done?
759802 761325 A database of some kind.
761325 763284 We have no moral center<br />as a society.
763284 765242 This is a systemic issue.
765634 767505 - You have it?<br />- I don't have it.
768028 769420 If it's any comfort,
769420 771248 these kinds of scams<br />are increasingly common.
771248 773816 Well, how do they know<br />who I am?
773816 776645 They contact people at random<br />using telephone listings
776645 779474 - and social networking sites.<br />- Like Facebook?
779735 780910 Sure. Like Facebook.
780910 784131 Well, how can Zuckemborg<br />let this happen?
784131 785567 Sorry?
785567 788396 Shouldn't Zuckemborg<br />be able to fix this?
789136 790398 Are you on Facebook?
790920 792530 - Am I?<br />- No you're not. She's not.
792530 794184 - Uh, this was a tangent.<br />No.
794184 796056 Detective Morgan: I would<br />suggest canceling your cards
796056 797927 and freezing your accounts<br />until you're sure
797927 799189 you didn't provide<br />any information
799189 801844 that can leave the door open<br />to more fraud.
801844 804368 Beyond that, there's not much<br />we can do at this point.
804368 805630 Hmm.
806893 807894 Detective Morgan: Sorry.
808808 809852 No, you're not.
812072 813551 You want a blanket?
814857 817164 Or, um, water or anything?
817164 820602 No, I'll just close my eyes<br />for a minute.
823823 825476 She gets confused.
825476 827435 -Not really.<br />-It's more than before.
827435 829306 I haven't noticed<br />that big of a difference.
829306 830830 Little things, maybe.
830830 832309 She's gotten<br />these calls before.
832309 834007 We may be entering<br />a new phase.
834007 836226 What? What do you mean...<br />...a new phase?
836226 839708 Now may be the time<br />where we really consider
839708 842145 whether or not living alone<br />is the best option.
842145 844147 - You think we're there?<br />-We're just...<br />We're considering it.
844713 846497 I lost my wallet last week.
846846 850110 I don't think that was a sign<br />of my mind deteriorating.
850110 851546 No, that's a lack of presence, sweetheart.
851546 852982 Did you order<br />a replacement license?
852982 855028 - Yeah, yeah. I did.<br />- Good 'cause you don't wanna be
855028 856856 driving without that.<br />You could end up in a database.
856856 858205 Why are you obsessed
858205 859336 with databases<br />all of a sudden?
859336 860685 You don't want<br />to end up in one.
860685 862252 Okay, well,<br />I just think that...
862992 864298 this can be handled.
864298 865560 Maybe I can handle it.
865560 866953 What are you proposing?
866953 869303 I will come over more,<br />I'll call every day,
869303 871044 and I'll make sure that<br />she keeps her Lifeline on.
871044 872523 Oh, my God,<br />I didn't tell you this.
872523 874743 Susan's mother fell<br />into a fire pit.
874743 875918 Completely died.
875918 877833 What?<br />Why are we talking about this?
877833 879879 Well, because things happen<br />to people as they age.
879879 881706 Weird, crazy things like that.
881706 883099 - Was it on?<br />- I didn't ask.
883099 884405 I assumed it was.
884405 886276 This wouldn't have<br />happened a year ago.
886276 888148 She's not as self-reliant<br />as she was.
888148 890063 We can't just keep doing<br />what we're doing.
890063 891455 She's 93.
891455 892979 Well, maybe it's time<br />for assisted living.
904991 906514 You sure<br />I can't stay over?
906514 907950 Oh, no. No, no.
907950 909604 - I've got things to do.<br />- Okay.
911780 913434 - Yeah.
916567 919788 - For my mental health.
936631 938459 Aw, Teddy.
940417 942202 I made a mistake.
1026590 1029463 -Uh, hi.<br />- Hello.
1029463 1031247 Do we know each other?
1031247 1033380 - I'm not sure.
1033380 1036078 [sighs] You...<br />you look so familiar.
1036078 1038211 Do you know Judy? Judy Miller?
1039038 1040822 I don't think so.
1041344 1044043 Do you know Ellen?<br />Ellen Marcus?
1044043 1046045 No, I don't think so.
1046958 1049918 - Well, have a nice day.<br />- Bye, now.
1082124 1083647 Hi.
1083647 1087129 - I... I found the address.<br />- What? What address?
1087129 1088522 <i>From the scam.</i>
1088522 1091133 It was this tiny slip<br />of paper.
1091133 1093179 You'll never guess<br />where I found it.
1093179 1094876 - Grandma, I'm sorry,<br />it's going...<br />-<i>It was...</i>
1094876 1096182 - <i>in the trash can...</i><br />- ...in and out.
1096182 1097357 I can't hear you that well.
1097357 1099446 ...in the bathroom<br />at the post office.
1100011 1102405 Wait, you went<br />to the post office?
1102405 1103580 Yeah.
1103580 1104755 <i>Well, how did you get there?</i>
1104755 1105974 Well, I walked.
1105974 1107410 Grandma.
1107410 1109151 That's far.<br />You should not have done that.
1109151 1111153 Well, it's a few blocks.
1111153 1115026 Y... you can't... You need<br />to tell me if you're gonna...
1116245 1118726 go somewhere,<br />so that I can take you, okay?
1119292 1120728 <i>What?</i>
1120728 1124384 You... you should not have<br />gone that far on your own.
1124906 1127126 But I found it.<br />I have it here.
1127126 1128344 <i>I know.</i>
1128344 1131173 Maybe it's better<br />to just pause for now
1131173 1135046 and we can<br />figure it out together. Okay?
1135569 1136744 What about my money?
1136744 1139050 Am I supposed to just<br />let them have it?
1139050 1140661 Well, but the odds<br />of getting it back
1140661 1142141 are pretty slim, right?
1142141 1143664 I mean,<br />the most important thing
1143664 1146406 is that you don't overdo it,<br />that... that you're safe.
1147189 1148625 <i>I'm sorry about the money,</i>
1149235 1151976 <i>but it... it could<br />have been a lot worse.</i>
1152847 1154762 Are you okay?<br />You're at home now?
1154762 1156198 Yeah, I'm at home.
1156198 1157808 <i>Oh, great.</i>
1157808 1161072 <i>You need to go anywhere,<br />just tell me. I can take you.</i>
1161072 1165076 Okay, darling.<br />Appreciate that. Speak soon.
1165076 1166904 - Love you. Oh.
1170430 1174434 Cynthia, I... I'm afraid<br />I need a bit of a favor.
1174434 1177741 Uh, it's an odd situation,<br />and... Uh...
1178394 1181789 Oh, Sarah.<br />I thought you were Cynthia.
1182050 1186489 She did? How awful.<br />Oh, Sarah, I'm so sorry.
1186489 1190450 No, no, no. Never mind.<br />Forget I called. All is well.
1190450 1193322 Hello? Is Harvin there?
1194410 1195629 Well, what happened?
1196238 1199502 Oh, a stroke.<br />Oh, I am so sorry, Joan.
1199502 1201156 A heart attack?
1201156 1202375 Sepsis?
1202375 1204159 He moved to Cleveland?
1204159 1206553 Well, when did this happen?
1206553 1209251 Oh, God,<br />I called Cynthia again.
1209251 1213212 Sarah, it was a mistake.<br />I know she's dead. Thank you.
1237279 1239890 Danny, I need a ride.
1240935 1243329 Just to get this<br />out of the way up top,
1243764 1246506 you were not at home.
1250336 1252207 All my friends are dead.
1252207 1255254 What? Don't say that.
1255254 1257952 Well, it's true.<br />They're all popping off.
1257952 1261129 I used to be<br />in four lunch groups.
1261564 1263392 Who's left? Judith?
1264001 1266961 She can't hear anything,<br />and she's a hunchback now.
1266961 1269920 I... I wouldn't want to have<br />lunch with her alone.
1269920 1273968 Herman's in Canada.<br />Mona doesn't leave the house.
1273968 1276100 I could ask Lee Horner<br />to join us,
1276100 1277754 but I don't have her number.
1277754 1280279 And Ruth burned up<br />in a fire pit.
1280279 1282281 I heard that. I'm sorry.
1284587 1286850 I didn't expect to get so old.
1287677 1288809 Well...
1289984 1291246 I'm glad you did.
1293640 1295206 Who do you know here, again?
1295206 1298427 You remember Ben. Ben Halpern?<br />He was married to Cheryl.
1298427 1299820 Oh, yeah.
1299820 1301952 Yeah, you guys used to see<br />each other all the time.
1301952 1305565 I always found him,<br />I don't know, s... s... soft.
1305565 1308132 - Soft?<br />- I... I don't know. Fussy.
1308132 1309090 Oh.
1310265 1311832 Cheryl's dead, too.
1312572 1315270 She fell down some stairs<br />in their house.
1316315 1318969 She was there for hours<br />before they found her.
1318969 1320101 Poor thing.
1320101 1321276 I remember.
1322190 1324584 This car is filthy.
1324584 1326760 I've taken good care of it.<br />I'm gonna clean it.
1326760 1329415 Oh, you don't clean it.<br />Who raised you?
1329415 1330590 Your daughter.
1330590 1332983 This is your father's<br />influence.
1332983 1335203 There are coins<br />all over the floor.
1335203 1338685 They fall out of his pockets<br />'cause he's got no waist.
1338685 1341775 Every time I ride with him,<br />I make five bucks.
1355136 1358226 - Want me to come in?<br />- Oh, I'm just saying hello.
1358226 1360968 I won't be long.<br />Thirty minutes.
1362012 1363710 If you need anything,<br />I'll be here.
1363710 1365233 -Okay.
1433432 1436217 Then you'll go<br />to The Roxy
1436217 1439612 and then an ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's
1439612 1443572 and then a hansom cab ride<br />around Central Park.
1444617 1446923 Gloria, that's your cue.
1446923 1449448 Oh, right.<br />And what do I say?
1449448 1451014 Theater Director: "Golly."
1451014 1455062 All right. Okay.<br />Do you know? Golly.
1455062 1456585 Theater Director:<br />Just "golly." Just the line.
1456585 1457804 I did, didn't I? Yes?
1457804 1459153 Theater Director:<br />Uh, not... not quite.
1459153 1460981 We went through that,<br />and I said...
1460981 1462896 Theater Director: Why don't we<br />go back to hansom cab,
1462896 1464985 and then grab golly?
1465246 1467640 Ah, it is good<br />to see you, Thel.
1468336 1471295 - You look terrific.<br />- Ah, I'm a balloon.
1472601 1474516 Well, what's with this?<br />Are you doing a play?
1474516 1477911 Yes. <i>Annie.</i><br />I got Daddy Warbucks.
1477911 1481480 - Well, that's a big role.<br />- Yeah, I wasn't expecting it.
1481480 1483394 I thought I'd be part<br />of the chorus
1483394 1485179 - or maybe Mr. Bundles.
1485179 1487573 We open tonight,<br />but Miss Hannigan...
1488530 1489662 she's senile,
1490358 1492447 and we got a lady<br />playing Roosevelt
1492447 1494318 because there's never<br />enough boys.
1494318 1498279 And Gloria, that's Annie,<br />she's a total amateur.
1498279 1501848 I'm going to have to bring<br />a lot of pizzazz.
1502762 1505025 You know,<br />I think about Teddy often.
1505547 1507070 What a special guy.
1507593 1509899 Uh, how long has it been?<br />Two years now?
1509899 1512641 - Just about two.<br />- Yeah, five for my Cheryl.
1513642 1515644 It feels like a dream.
1517820 1520780 - How are you holding up?<br />- Let's not be maudlin.
1520780 1522433 You going to show me<br />your place?
1522433 1524044 Oh, oh, sure, sure. Come on.
1524566 1526263 Got a TV.
1527526 1529005 Window. Plants.
1529789 1530790 Do you mind?
1532705 1534881 Infection starts<br />from the hands.
1536012 1538275 Director is trying to get me<br />to touch Gloria
1538275 1540060 in that scene<br />where I adopt her,
1540060 1542584 but I'm not going to do it.<br />It's not worth it.
1542584 1544586 If it makes it worse,<br />so be it.
1544586 1546545 It's not like<br />we're being reviewed.
1547589 1551593 Oh, this is Gary.<br />We call him Starey Gary.
1551593 1552899 It's not an insult.
1553160 1554553 It's just something<br />that happens.
1555423 1556772 I don't think he minds.
1557338 1559340 Everybody does it.<br />Not just me.
1559340 1560602 Everybody calls him that.
1562299 1565520 Ah. Isn't she a beauty?
1565520 1568915 Three wheels,<br />43 miles per charge,
1568915 1570917 and bright red,<br />so you can see me coming.
1570917 1573615 And a little basket<br />for whatever you need.
1573615 1575356 I like to put bread in there.
1575356 1578402 Not... not a whole bread<br />but just little pieces.
1578402 1580013 You put them in loose?
1580013 1582929 No, no, no.<br />In... in bags. Ziploc.
1582929 1584713 You think I could borrow it?
1586062 1587194 Borrow my scooter?
1587498 1588630 Well, I...
1590327 1592199 I'm in a bit of a situation.
1592199 1595898 - What?<br />- I'm in a bit of a situation.
1596246 1597900 It's...
1597900 1600947 Oh, it's a headache.<br />The less you know, the better.
1601643 1604472 Well, if it involves<br />my scooter, it involves me.
1605342 1607780 I... I don't want to say<br />in front of Gary.
1609085 1611566 Uh, Gary, can you<br />give us a second?
1612654 1614395 Is he going to listen?
1614395 1616963 I'm not sure,<br />but he's going to watch.
1618486 1620009 Have you got a telephone?
1620009 1621141 Yes.
1626320 1628322 Automated Voice:<br /><i>Microphone enabled.</i>
1631107 1632892 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
1634284 1635982 <i>I got scammed,</i>
1636678 1639725 <i>but I have the address<br />where I sent the money.</i>
1639725 1646557 <i>It's a P.O. box in Van Nuys.<br />1534 San Fernando Road.</i>
1646557 1648777 <i>I'm on my way there now.</i>
1649125 1652651 <i>I'm going to try to figure out<br />who took it and get it back.</i>
1656655 1658221 <i>What are you, nuts?</i>
1658744 1661268 <i>That's absurd.<br />You got to tell the police.</i>
1661268 1665054 <i>- Oh, they're no use.<br />- What about your family?</i>
1665794 1669493 <i>- Not with this.<br />- It's a bad idea.</i>
1669493 1671495 <i>But you have a better one?</i>
1671495 1674498 <i>You're not thinking straight.<br />You're grieving.</i>
1675151 1678241 <i>At least you have your health.<br />Be grateful for that.</i>
1694257 1696956 Listen, why don't you stay<br />for lunch?
1697696 1702788 We have a beautiful cafeteria<br />and wonderful melons. Fresh.
1703310 1704267 Sure.
1706443 1708881 D... do you think<br />I could try it out?
1708881 1711274 I... I may be in the market<br />for one.
1713668 1717150 I love driving.<br />I miss it.
1719108 1721241 Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
1750923 1752707 Winston, can I borrow<br />your scooter?
1753055 1755971 Winston. Ah, I'm taking it.
1762673 1764240 Uh, are you talking to me?
1769811 1772074 -Thel.<br />- Son of a bitch.
1772074 1773815 Stay there. I'm coming to you.
1790527 1791528 What?
1800102 1801756 - Ow.
1807109 1808763 Dang it.
1814029 1815335 - Oh.
1830393 1831438 Thelma.
1861120 1864166 - Let's just talk.<br />- Everybody wants to talk.
1864166 1867300 My God.<br />I just needed your scooter.
1867300 1869693 Please be a doll<br />and don't make a fuss.
1871086 1873262 My grandson's<br />parked a block away.
1873262 1874742 I don't have much time.
1874742 1876309 You left your grandson<br />in the car?
1876309 1878180 Well, he's 24.
1878180 1880835 Please don't make me<br />go through you,
1880835 1882532 - Ben.<br />- Oh, no, you couldn't.
1882532 1884186 I got a titanium hip.
1884186 1886493 Well, should we<br />put that to the test?
1886493 1888974 I'm going,<br />with or without you.
1889278 1892368 I'm not going to let you<br />go alone. I won't.
1902291 1905425 Hi. Um, I'm looking<br />for my grandma.
1905425 1907122 Thelma Post. White hair.
1907122 1908471 A little wobbly.<br />Very determined.
1908471 1909516 Okay.
1909516 1910952 She's not...<br />she's not...
1910952 1912519 She doesn't live here,<br />but she's visiting a friend.
1912519 1913999 She would have come in<br />like 30 minutes ago.
1913999 1915870 Huh.<br />So, I'm not seeing her here...
1915870 1917828 - Okay.<br />- ...but...
1920701 1922572 - Grandma?<br />- Resident 1: Hello?
1922572 1923965 Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry.
1923965 1926576 Uh, I'm just looking<br />for my grandma. Sorry.
1926576 1927926 - Resident 2: Hello?<br />- Hi, there.
1927926 1929536 - You took my scooter?<br />- What? No.
1929536 1931973 You sound like the man<br />who took my scooter.
1931973 1934497 I didn't take... I promise,<br />I... I... No, I'm...
1934497 1936543 You're getting me nervous.<br />You're getting me nervous.
1936543 1937500 Sorry. I'm gonna go.
1937500 1938632 - Yeah, go.<br />- Uh, good luck.
1938632 1940025 What do you mean, "Good luck?"
1940025 1941809 If you took my scooter,<br />don't tell me good luck.
1943115 1944986 Do you know Ben? Uh...
1945769 1947510 Uh, Halpern, I believe?
1951079 1953690 Mom, uh, we may have<br />a little situation here.
1953690 1956084 No, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.<br />No, I'm not in jail.
1956084 1958347 No. Um, it's Grandma.
1964397 1966225 I got to be back by 8:00.
1966225 1968357 It's opening night,<br />and I don't want to miss it.
1968357 1970055 I got it. I got it.
1982937 1984678 <i>Um, I checked every room.</i>
1984678 1985940 <i>She's not answering her phone,</i>
1985940 1988464 <i>but she should<br />have her Lyfe Line on.</i>
1988464 1991032 So has she ever<br />wandered off before?
1991032 1992425 Never. Not like this.
1992425 1994296 One time, I thought I lost her<br />at Souplantation,
1994296 1996777 but she was just going back<br />for, uh, little pizzas.
1996777 1998474 Souplantation.
1998474 2000607 It was a buffet restaurant.<br />You could go back for more.
2000607 2004002 I can't believe it was<br />actually called Souplantation.
2004002 2005568 - I never processed that.<br />-Oh, wow.
2005568 2007266 Well, it had things<br />she could chew.
2007266 2008310 She can't chew anything.
2008310 2010008 She can chew some things,<br />Alan.
2010008 2011226 It's, like...<br />It's confusing, you know,
2011226 2012575 what she can and can't chew.
2012575 2015883 Like, she can't have a salad,<br />but she can...
2015883 2017537 Like, last week,<br />she ate a cashew.
2017537 2019060 So she hasn't<br />wandered off before?
2019060 2021802 Except to a salad bar?<br />By choice?
2022324 2023717 - Exactly. Right?<br />- Yeah.
2023717 2025849 Well, um, I don't want<br />to alarm you guys,
2025849 2028200 but one of our residents<br />is missing.
2028200 2030506 -Oh.<br />- Um, yeah. Ben Halpern.
2030506 2031768 - Oh, Ben.<br />- Yeah, she, she um...
2031768 2033074 Are the two of them involved?
2033074 2035816 No. No. They're...<br />they're not even...
2035816 2037818 She doesn't even really<br />like him all that much.
2037818 2039515 Oh, so is there bad blood?
2039515 2040908 - What are you insinuating?<br />-Nothing.
2040908 2042214 No, no, no. Not like that.
2042214 2043998 We're just... we're just<br />trying to understand.
2043998 2045652 You know he has<br />a show tonight.
2045652 2047132 - How would we know that?<br />- No.
2047132 2048655 Well, does his family...
2048655 2050700 Have you notified<br />his family that he's missing?
2050700 2052528 He doesn't have any family.
2052528 2053877 - So, no.<br />- Oh.
2053877 2055270 Aww.
2055270 2056837 Well, what can<br />we be doing here?
2056837 2059144 Can you guys send out<br />some kind of senior alert?
2059144 2060928 - Uh, Silver Alert?<br />- A Silver Alert.
2060928 2062234 -No.<br />-No.
2062234 2063974 We are not authorized<br />to do that.
2063974 2065759 The police have to declare her
2065759 2067065 - a missing person.<br />- A missing person.
2067065 2069241 But she is a missing person.
2069241 2071330 - Don't you have somebody...<br />- We don't know where she is.
2071330 2073419 - It's only been an hour,<br />right?<br />- Yeah, just one hour.
2073419 2075290 Right,<br />it hasn't been that long.
2075290 2076465 Yeah, curtain's not until 8:00.
2076465 2077640 What's the show?
2077640 2078772 You're still talking<br />about the show?
2078772 2079773 <i>- Annie.<br />- Annie.</i>
2079773 2081644 - Oh, that's a good one.<br />- Oh.
2081644 2084038 So, uh, does Thelma have any<br />specific medical conditions
2084038 2085213 that we should know about?
2085213 2088042 She's had breast cancer,<br />double mastectomy,
2088042 2090175 sepsis, edema,
2090175 2092742 valve replacement,<br />hip replacement,
2092742 2094483 arrhythmia, brain tumor.
2094483 2096224 I think she actually has<br />a brain tumor right now.
2096224 2097791 Yeah, the doctor said it was<br />growing slowly...
2097791 2099227 - That's right. Yeah.<br />- ...so they could...
2099227 2101055 She has a brain tumor.<br />...just leave it in there.
2101055 2102970 And, so, all of that<br />and a brain tumor<br />at the moment.
2102970 2104014 Yeah.
2104537 2106321 Wow, uh, thank you.
2106321 2108497 Thank you so much<br />for telling us all of that.
2108497 2110151 And she had the TGA, right?
2110151 2113067 - TGA?<br />- Transient global amnesia.
2113067 2114764 Yeah, it was about a year ago.
2114764 2117419 And, um, she just...<br />she got very disoriented.
2117419 2119378 She didn't know who she was.<br />She didn't know who we were.
2119378 2121162 Lasted only just about<br />an hour.
2121945 2123599 But it was...<br />it was unsettling.
2125340 2127864 But she's a tough cookie.
2127864 2130128 Obviously, we want help<br />finding her.
2130128 2133696 It's just,<br />it might still be a, you know,
2134219 2137831 "going back to the buffet"<br />type of situation, I think.
2137831 2141661 Well, the good news is,<br />they rarely go far.
2168078 2169776 Uh, Thel,
2169776 2171778 why does this street<br />look so familiar to me?
2171778 2173562 We're stopping at Mona's.
2173562 2177131 Oh, I haven't seen Mona<br />since Berlin.
2177131 2179264 That was a fun trip,<br />wasn't it?
2179612 2181701 What year was it? '95?
2181701 2184051 Um, '98, I think.
2184051 2187097 Ah, it was a bumpy flight,<br />but otherwise it was terrific.
2188621 2191580 You know Mona<br />is obsessed with me.
2191885 2193408 We... we never acted on it,
2193408 2195367 but she would always stare<br />at my legs
2195367 2197151 whenever I had short pants on.
2197151 2199893 Whatever you say, buddy.
2199893 2202722 Now, if you're right,<br />maybe we could use it.
2204245 2206116 Why are we stopping at Mona's?
2206116 2207292 To get a gun.
2207292 2210425 Oh, my God.<br />What do we need a gun for?
2210425 2212035 It's just a precaution.
2212035 2215343 Couple of schmegegges like us<br />turning up unannounced...
2215343 2217258 I like to be prepared.
2217258 2218825 Do you even know<br />how to use it?
2218825 2222611 Well, how hard can it be?<br />Idiots use them all the time.
2223525 2226224 You're going to have<br />to distract her.
2226224 2227877 She's still sharp.
2227877 2229966 This is not going to be<br />so easy.
2229966 2231968 Maybe I could do my monologue.
2232491 2234014 I'd rather you didn't.
2262303 2263435 Mona?
2265306 2268527 Thel, darling,<br />did we make a date?
2268527 2272008 Oh, no. No, no.<br />We were in the neighborhood.
2272008 2276404 - I would have put shoes on.<br />Ben's here, too.
2276404 2277840 Good to see you, doll.
2279189 2282889 - Are you all right?<br />- Fine, fine.
2286327 2289461 Oh. Oh. Sit, dear.<br />Don't... don't clean.
2289461 2291637 Okay, okay.
2294422 2296337 - Is it a roach?
2296337 2298513 Oh, you... you...<br />you got bugs?
2298513 2302343 I've been hunting 'em.<br />Can't seem to knock 'em off.
2302343 2304258 Oh, they're resilient.
2304258 2307348 That's why they make<br />worthy adversaries.
2307348 2310699 You get one,<br />there are ten more<br />to replace him.
2310699 2313049 I've learned<br />to pick my battles.
2313789 2315748 So, uh, how are you?
2316662 2319099 - How's your health?<br />- I'm alive.
2319099 2321667 Oh, isn't that something?
2321667 2325061 - I got to use the bathroom.<br />- Oh, good, dear.
2327020 2329631 Um...
2329631 2332852 We were just talking<br />about Berlin.
2347475 2350913 We stayed<br />at that wonderful hotel.
2351349 2355570 The Kimch...<br />Kimpinchky? Kimsky?
2355570 2357616 Did we take a trip?
2360488 2363186 Um, that was a long time ago.
2367756 2368627 Oh.
2370933 2374589 Um, you know,<br />I'm over at Belwood now.
2375590 2379159 They have<br />the most wonderful melons.
2421288 2422376 Cantaloupe.
2423682 2425031 Honeydew.
2426336 2427642 Jade dews.
2429252 2430993 - Berries.<br />- Berries?
2430993 2433256 Mm, yeah.<br />All kinds of berries.
2434257 2437391 Raspberries. Blueberries.
2452101 2453320 Blackberries.
2455235 2456584 Cherries.
2472295 2474167 Uh, elderberries.
2480695 2484699 "Annie, get your goddamn hound<br />out of my pool."
2489443 2492925 Thel, did we make a date?
2493621 2496058 Oh, no, no, I...
2496058 2497973 I was just<br />in the neighborhood.
2497973 2500889 I would have put my shoes on.
2502587 2506286 Well, I think it's time<br />we were on our way.
2506286 2509681 - You're leaving?<br />- I know, I know.
2509681 2511900 We'll have to get<br />a lunch on the books.
2511900 2513249 I'd like that.
2514076 2516949 Can we get you anything?
2516949 2519168 I've got everything I need.
2524043 2525087 Goodbye, doll.
2566694 2570829 - Uh, she needs a charge.<br />- Oh.
2572482 2574528 I need to get IDs<br />from everyone.
2575094 2576748 Sure. Here.
2579054 2580142 Thank you.
2583015 2584364 Can't find your wallet?
2584364 2586845 I... I, um... I have it.<br />I'm just not seeing my ID.
2586845 2588237 You're not even looking.<br />You're just patting.
2588237 2589369 Oh, yeah.
2589717 2592154 -Let me help.<br />- I, uh... Uh...
2592154 2593895 You didn't order<br />a replacement license?
2593895 2595810 - No, I did. I did.<br />-Don't lie.
2595810 2597638 - It's in there.<br />- Just tell us you didn't
2597638 2599597 - I'd rather know<br />than be lied to.<br />-It's...
2600336 2602034 I haven't, uh, yet.
2602034 2604036 -Why would you<br />keep this from us?<br />-Becau...
2604036 2605907 Why would you keep this<br />from us? This sucks.
2605907 2607822 - Daniel, that's really bad.<br />- But I'm... I'm gonna do it.
2607822 2608867 Can't drive without a license.
2608867 2610129 He can't drive<br />without a license.
2610129 2611652 I mean, he could,<br />but he... he shouldn't.
2611652 2613001 Okay, thank you, everyone.
2613001 2616135 You have to take care<br />of your vehicle, Daniel.
2616135 2617658 - Do you understand my...<br />- I understand.
2617658 2619225 This is the basics<br />of adult life.
2619225 2622707 Dad, please don't embarrass me<br />in front of...
2623751 2625971 Colin...<br />...and Rochelle.
2625971 2627886 We can give you guys a second.
2634762 2636590 Allie was very good for you<br />in that way.
2636590 2638853 She was very organized,
2639332 2642727 left-brained,<br />a grounding force.
2642727 2645077 Can we please not talk<br />about Allie?
2645077 2647470 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2647470 2649516 -Thank you.<br />-I know it's hard.
2649908 2652084 I just don't like<br />to see you suffer like this.
2653172 2656044 - Makes me want to cry.<br />- What? No.
2656044 2657959 I do.<br />It makes me very sad.
2657959 2659700 -It's okay.<br />- I have to cry.
2659700 2662660 -Okay.<br />- I just need to get it out.
2664879 2666533 Do you want us to...
2667752 2671233 sit with you and...<br />to get a replacement license?
2671233 2672321 I... I can handle it.
2672670 2674976 - Let's just deal with one...<br />- I'm sorry.
2674976 2676891 ...family crisis<br />at a time, okay?
2682941 2686771 - Chaim took this. My cousin.
2687728 2689338 Did you ever meet Chaim?
2689338 2691384 - No.<br />- From Hinsdale.
2692385 2693734 He's not doing so hot,
2693734 2695649 but this is<br />a beautiful picture.
2697042 2698783 She shouldn't be living<br />like that.
2700088 2701655 She's managing.
2702351 2704876 How is she getting her meals?
2704876 2707617 Uh, and when is the last time<br />she got out of that chair?
2708270 2709576 She's wasting away.
2709576 2713058 We all have our good days<br />and our bad days.
2713058 2715451 - And what's today?<br />- We'll find out.
2718977 2720761 Gary's going to wonder<br />where I am.
2720761 2724069 What's with you?<br />Do you miss that place?
2724069 2727507 - I like that place.<br />- What's to like?
2727507 2731467 I swim twice a week.<br />There's wonderful classes...
2731467 2734949 cooking classes,<br />painting classes, oopsie upsy.
2734949 2736777 - "Oopsie upsy"?<br />-Oopsie upsy.
2736777 2738910 That's when a professional<br />comes in and shows us
2738910 2741173 how to pick each other up<br />after we fall.
2741173 2743784 There's a tub lift,<br />a shower lift,
2743784 2746178 and a dual lift<br />for when a couple falls.
2746178 2748006 Does that happen often?
2748006 2752010 Uh, not often, but it happens.<br />Usually on a hill.
2752010 2755665 You have to use each other's<br />weight as a counterbalance.
2755665 2757189 Sounds interesting.
2761454 2765153 Cheryl used to cook,<br />pick up our socks,
2765153 2766894 keep the place together.
2767808 2770419 I'll take help<br />where I can get it.
2770419 2771986 I'm not ashamed.
2772813 2774293 It's not the same.
2775424 2776512 Why?
2777035 2779080 I always picked up the socks.
2785739 2786784 Hm.
2795575 2798099 - She posted.<br />-What?<br />She posted something?
2798099 2799405 - I think it...<br />-No.
2799405 2800841 Yeah, five minutes...<br />By accident, I think.
2800841 2802321 - Five minutes ago.<br />-Oh, my God.
2802321 2804366 - Look, look.<br />- Let's see.<br />Let's see. Let's see.
2804366 2805324 Do you recognize anything?
2805324 2806716 Make it bigger. Zoom in.
2806716 2808718 - Can you enhance it?<br />-Enhancing.
2808718 2810982 I see gas pumps,<br />a blue car, a pigeon.
2810982 2812679 - No, two pigeons.<br />- This is Tujunga. Tujunga.
2812679 2814028 - Yeah, um...<br />-Oh, isn't there
2814028 2815421 - a gas station on Tujunga?<br />- Moorpark
2815421 2816422 - and Tujunga.<br />- Yes!
2816422 2817597 Moorpark and Tujunga.
2817597 2818728 And we're going, we're going.
2821949 2822907 Ah, damn.
2827694 2830218 Come on. We g...<br />We got to move.
2830218 2834396 Waze says 12 minutes<br />via Chandler and Colfax.
2837356 2838705 Look at that.
2839053 2841926 Who created that?<br />Who thought it up?
2843101 2844842 A plug for a car.
2845320 2848410 Electricity goes through,<br />makes it run.
2849107 2852588 But what is electricity?<br />It boggles the mind.
2854590 2857115 - Oh, I think I know her.
2860031 2862424 - Can you go a little faster?<br />- Yes, thank you.
2862424 2864557 - God. Please.<br />- I'm going the speed limit.
2865210 2867299 We are a law-abiding family.
2872347 2874175 - Huh.
2874915 2876438 Wants me to make a left.
2877309 2879441 This is why I don't use Waze.
2879441 2881530 It wants you to make<br />all these crazy turns.
2881530 2884403 Marcy Wender's husband<br />was obsessed with Waze,
2884403 2886840 makes a psycho left,<br />ends up in Vons.
2886840 2887885 Estimates are<br />very accurate, Gail.
2887885 2889756 He paid thousands of dollars.
2889756 2891366 -No they're not.<br />-It's been proven.
2891366 2893412 Do you know Vi?<br />Vi Friedlander?
2893934 2896154 - Maybe through Saul.<br />-Saul?
2896502 2900375 - Gary's kid. Gary Newman?<br />- No, I don't know them.
2900898 2906077 - Oh. Did you go to Sinai?<br />- No, we were at Beth Am.
2906077 2908906 You just look so terribly<br />familiar to me.
2908906 2910516 Just have to ignore<br />all your instincts
2910516 2911734 and trust the technology.
2911734 2913911 Technology is what got us<br />into this mess
2913911 2915477 in the first place.<br />Can you go back?
2915477 2917349 -I can't go back.<br />- There's someone behind us.
2917349 2918785 -I see them.<br />-So, go.
2918785 2920134 - I can't go.<br />- There's a gap.
2920134 2921788 - There's a...<br />- There's a gap, Alan.
2921788 2923921 -Take it!<br />- Go, just go.
2925705 2926793 Go. Yes, yes.
2926793 2928882 - Yes, yes, yes.<br />- Yes, yes, yes.
2928882 2930275 - Okay, okay, okay.
2930275 2932712 - Ah!
2932712 2935454 - Yes, yes, I did.
2936411 2937978 And we're back to 12 minutes.
2938936 2940415 Gary Newman.
2940415 2942983 Oh, no.<br />My Gary is Rozelle.
2942983 2944506 Isn't that interesting?
2944506 2947031 Two different Garys,<br />but both Gary.
2949947 2952993 - How do you know each other?<br />- I guess we don't.
2952993 2955213 It seemed possible.
2955213 2956605 - Alas.
2956605 2958129 Have a lovely day.
2958129 2962568 - You too.
2971533 2973057 -What?
2975537 2976886 - What?<br />-Oh.
2978192 2980803 - What happened?<br />- It... it's my grandson.
2982718 2985025 -Mom! Thelma!<br />-Grandma!
2985025 2987462 Oh, it's them.<br />Come on, get out.
2989421 2990857 -Thelma!<br />- Alan and Daniel: Thelma!
2990857 2992032 Hi.<br />Have you seen a woman
2992032 2993991 with, like, white hair?<br />A real lady?
2995209 2997081 -Thelma!<br />-Thelma!
2997777 3000649 -Thelma!<br />-Thelma!
3000649 3003478 Oh, we can't make that.
3003478 3004610 Grandma.
3004610 3005959 What's that?<br />Is that...
3005959 3007352 -Grandma!<br />-That is interesting.
3007352 3009441 -Oh, shit.<br />-Thelma!
3013097 3014315 -Oh, shit.<br />-What?
3014315 3015534 Her Lifeline.
3015534 3017449 What is it?<br />Do you have a location?
3017449 3019059 -What's it say?<br />- She's here.
3019059 3021018 - She's here.<br />- Ah. Where? Oh.
3050395 3052440 We are crazy.
3076943 3078901 <i>Could it have fallen off?</i>
3079380 3080686 Not on its own.
3081469 3084124 Just to consider<br />all our options,
3084124 3086692 is it... is it possible<br />she had another TGA?
3086692 3088346 - Her behavior's erratic.<br />- I... I don't know. Yeah.
3088346 3090826 I mean, it seems<br />like it's within the realm<br />of possibility.
3090826 3092741 I'm... I'm just... I'm going<br />to Google it just to...
3092741 3094874 I told her<br />not to take it off.
3096136 3097964 "Acute onset<br />of anterograde amnesia."
3097964 3102751 I can't remember if it was<br />on her wrist in the car.
3102751 3105493 She likes her independence<br />from that thing. She just...
3105493 3106755 Sometimes she puts it<br />in her bag.
3106755 3109802 I... I can't remember.
3109802 3112283 "...signs indicating damage<br />to a particular area..."
3112283 3113893 I should have walked her in.
3113893 3115982 It's in the past. Hmm?
3118854 3120378 Why didn't you?
3120378 3122728 - She didn't want me to.<br />- Why didn't she want you to?
3122728 3125165 - I don't know, Mom. I...<br />-Don't yell.
3125165 3128212 I'm sorry, I'm sorry,<br />I just... I'm upset.
3128212 3130083 Yeah, we're all upset.
3130779 3134218 This is exactly what<br />we have been trying to avoid,
3134653 3136698 and now my mother is at large.
3136698 3139788 I can't...<br />I can't do anything.
3139788 3143227 I literally can't do anything.<br />I'm such a little bitch.
3143749 3145751 Don't call yourself that. God.
3145751 3150147 I truly have<br />no ability to do anything.
3150147 3152671 I can't do anything<br />with my hands. I can't...
3152671 3154194 What do you want to do<br />with your hands?
3154194 3155761 I don't know. Nothing.<br />I just... I can't...
3155761 3157241 I don't know facts.
3157241 3159068 I have no qualifications<br />for any jobs.
3159068 3160418 I... I can't do math.
3160418 3162420 It's basically why Allie<br />and I aren't together.
3162420 3166163 Because you couldn't do math?<br />I thought she could do math.
3166163 3168469 It's just another thing<br />that I can't do.
3168469 3170167 I haven't done the I.D.
3170167 3172081 because every time<br />I go on the computer,
3172081 3174432 I get all confused<br />by the stupid website
3174432 3176608 and all the classifications
3176608 3178523 and the... and the...<br />and the terms.
3178523 3180873 Do you have visual,<br />uh, what's it?
3180873 3184355 - Processing.<br />- Processing issues?
3184920 3187358 Sure. Or maybe I'm just<br />a stupid little bitch
3187358 3188924 - who can't do anything.<br />- Don't say "bitch."
3188924 3190012 - Stop.<br />- Stop saying "bitch."
3190012 3192363 I lost Grandma. Fuck!
3210903 3212513 Think we're getting closer?
3221392 3223742 - Thelma?<br />- Hang on.
3224699 3227093 - What is it?<br />- I don't know where we are.
3227093 3228616 Oh, don't say that.
3228616 3231097 I thought<br />we were heading north.
3233012 3234753 I'm gonna go find help.
3234753 3238626 Oh, no, Ben, give me a moment.<br />Let me orient myself.
3239105 3240802 Ben.
3243762 3246199 Ben, don't make a scene.
3246199 3249289 You don't listen to me, Thel.<br />You don't listen to anybody.
3249550 3253467 If I listened to you,<br />I'd be your roommate by now.
3253467 3255252 Go home, Ben.<br />You don't want to be here.
3255252 3258777 - We should call your family.<br />- Out of the question.
3258777 3260692 - What about your grandson?<br />-No.
3260692 3261910 - No.<br />- Why?
3261910 3264478 Because I'm not like you, Ben.
3264478 3268482 As much as you may want me<br />to be, I like to be useful.
3269048 3271268 We're more alike<br />than you think.
3271268 3273095 What's that supposed to mean?
3273095 3274445 We're old.
3275750 3276925 Diminished.
3277404 3279841 We're a liability<br />to the ones we love.
3280451 3282279 You can tell<br />yourself different,
3282888 3285282 but you know<br />that they're worried sick.
3285760 3287501 What's to worry about?
3287501 3290939 I move from point to point.<br />I don't complain.
3290939 3294116 I am the same.<br />And you would be, too,
3294116 3296205 if you stopped feeling sorry<br />for yourself.
3296205 3298120 It doesn't work that way.
3298120 3300340 You start acting like a baby,<br />people treat you like a baby.
3300340 3301559 Bullshit.
3303125 3305780 You know how I know?<br />Because I couldn't...
3306128 3308174 I couldn't hear her<br />when she fell.
3314441 3316269 We're not what we were.
3320360 3321883 We're the only ones left.
3322928 3325496 The least we can do<br />is take care of each other.
3328977 3330892 Call your family.
3334809 3338465 I don't need them.<br />I don't need you.
3338465 3341816 I just needed your scooter.
3356222 3358659 We were stopped.
3358659 3360487 Did you put<br />the parking brake on?
3360835 3363229 I didn't know there was one.
3363229 3366363 I didn't know.<br />I... I'm sorry, Ben.
3366972 3368626 You're not sorry.
3370932 3373326 Ben, where are you going?
3377156 3378984 I'm not waiting!
3392737 3394913 <i>We've all lost her before.</i>
3395566 3397481 I've lost her at Gelson's<br />a few times.
3397916 3399483 The woman likes<br />to keep moving.
3399483 3401223 Especially<br />if she has that cart.
3401659 3403008 When she sets her mind<br />to something,
3403008 3404052 there's no stopping her.
3404052 3405793 She doesn't eat,<br />she doesn't sleep.
3405793 3408709 She just, like,<br />keeps that laser focus...
3408709 3410929 - Hmm.<br />- ...till the task is done.
3410929 3412670 This is different<br />than Gelson's.
3412670 3414149 Well, I'm aware<br />it's different.
3414149 3415455 But she's a grown woman
3415455 3417457 who's a little faster<br />than you would hope.
3417936 3419633 And you can't<br />be responsible for her
3419633 3421418 every second of every day.
3421418 3423028 We shouldn't have<br />put that on you.
3423028 3424290 It was too much.
3424638 3427075 I know that<br />she's not gonna live forever.
3428903 3431819 But I just... when it happens,
3431819 3436737 I want it to be not horrific,<br />you know?
3438739 3440785 Like, a good death.
3442221 3443788 There is no good death.
3449489 3450795 I'm gonna take a walk.
3450795 3452144 Oh, can we go with you?
3452144 3454276 - I'll go with him.<br />- I want to go with him.
3454276 3456888 No, no, no, no, I'm...<br />I want to go alone.
3456888 3458455 I just need a little, um...
3459064 3460544 - space to think.<br />- Where are you walking?
3460544 3462328 - Where are you gonna go?<br />- I don't know, just...
3462328 3464286 Do you... do you have<br />your phone on you?
3464722 3466071 Please don't keep it<br />on silent.
3466071 3467768 - No. Here. Take...<br />- Can you do that for me?
3467768 3469727 - ...take this.<br />- For my mental health?
3469727 3471119 I'm gonna be close. It's fine.
3471119 3474383 - Just... It's fully charged.<br />-Okay.
3474383 3476168 And it just snaps on here.
3476690 3477822 There we go.
3478779 3481521 Have a nice walk. I love you.
3481521 3482653 I love you, too.
3586713 3590848 Oh. Oh.
3591588 3592676 Oh.
3625056 3626231 Oh.
3750616 3751704 Ah.
3754098 3755490 Thank you.
3756013 3757144 You're welcome.
3758842 3762149 I'm sorry. About all of it.
3763368 3765718 But we gave it a good try,<br />didn't we?
3766980 3768329 Yes, we did.
3772943 3777599 I lived with my parents<br />till I was 23.
3777599 3779384 Then I moved in with Teddy...
3780428 3783431 and I lived with him<br />until I was 91.
3784606 3788436 I've lived just me<br />for two years now.
3789742 3791918 Gets lonely sometimes.
3794573 3796096 And I miss Teddy.
3799056 3803016 But I... I tried sushi,<br />and I liked that quite a bit.
3807586 3809806 I've enjoyed my time alone.
3813810 3815986 I guess I wanted more of it.
3826083 3827998 I think I know her.
3829260 3831915 - Lois?<br />- Thelma!
3834961 3837311 We just saw <i>Swan Lake.</i>
3837311 3840488 And it was set<br />during the Korean War,
3840488 3843187 so the dancers were<br />all dressed like soldiers.
3843187 3845189 I... I don't know<br />that I understood it,
3845189 3850063 but it was beautifully staged.<br />I think it was very political.
3850063 3852849 - Sounds interesting.<br />-It was, yes.
3853110 3854720 So, where can we take you?
3854720 3858202 Oh. Just home.<br />Ben, what's your address?
3858202 3862423 We're heading<br />to 1534 San Fernando Road.
3864948 3868038 Well, we've come this far.<br />We might as well finish it.
3868038 3869866 Well, what about your show?
3870605 3874696 There is no show<br />without Daddy Warbucks.
3908905 3910167 Twenty-one.
3911908 3914432 - What now?<br />- We wait.
3915302 3917043 -[over cellphone] <i>Hi.</i><br />-<i>Hey.</i>
3917043 3919959 Thanks for picking up. Um...
3920829 3925269 Are you slinging those<br />crunchy-crunchy tiki tacos?
3925922 3928925 Yeah. Yeah, that's why<br />they pay me the big bucks.
3929708 3931362 How's it going with you?
3931710 3932972 [over cellphone] <i>Okay.</i>
3933407 3935279 Um, bad, actually.
3936497 3938325 My grandma's missing,
3938325 3941111 <i>and I'm camped out<br />at an old folks' home</i>
3941111 3943548 <i>- with my parents.</i><br />- Wait, what? How?
3943548 3945593 She went to visit a friend,
3945593 3947334 and then they went<br />missing together.
3947334 3949119 <i>It's been a couple hours<br />so far.</i>
3949119 3950990 <i>I mean, the whole thing<br />is just... I don't know,<br />it's...</i>
3950990 3952818 They didn't sign out<br />or anything,
3952818 3954602 but I was supposed<br />to watch her, so...
3954602 3959651 Okay, well, uh, could she have<br />just gone somewhere
3959651 3960869 without telling you guys?
3960869 3962219 <i>That's what we thought.</i>
3962219 3963829 We thought it could be<br />a Souplantation situation.
3963829 3965222 <i>A... a what?</i>
3965222 3967833 No, nothing. I mean,<br />it's possible, I guess.
3967833 3969748 Well, I only asked<br />because she's...
3970705 3973012 obsessed with errands, right?
3973012 3975884 Well, yeah. She has<br />a healthy respect for errands.
3976320 3978017 Well, I know<br />you really love her.
3978017 3980237 I'm sure you're<br />super worried, but...
3980672 3984676 Maybe she's just<br />doing something.
3985111 3987809 <i>You know? On her own.</i>
3988332 3989724 Yeah.
3991422 3992640 I hope so.
3994338 3996644 <i>Hey, I've also<br />been wanting to call you.</i>
3996644 3999517 <i>I was thinking about<br />taking some classes,</i>
3999517 4001432 maybe an adult math class,
4001432 4005088 or, like, just brush up on...<br />on some of those essentials.
4005088 4007046 - What are you talking about?<br />-<i>Self-improvement.</i>
4007046 4009527 I'm just saying I...<br />I can learn to do more things,
4009527 4012834 adding and subtracting,<br />uh, fractals.
4012834 4015881 Like, I can take the great<br />leap from boy to man.
4015881 4017491 You're driving me nuts,<br />do you know that?
4017491 4021017 I do. I...<br />I do know that, very much.
4022061 4024150 Sorry.<br />It's so freaking hot in here.
4024150 4026457 Okay, well, go for a walk.
4026457 4028372 My folks asked me<br />to stay close.
4030374 4032637 <i>Well, if you ever take<br />that great leap,</i>
4033377 4036510 for what it's worth,<br />I think you could make it.
4038643 4040819 - Oh, my God!<br />-<i>What?</i>
4040819 4044475 Um, there's, uh, been a guy<br />in here the whole time.
4046216 4049697 We used to call bread<br />the staff of life.
4050785 4053788 But now nobody wants<br />to eat bread.
4055051 4058315 But there are delicious breads<br />being made now.
4058315 4060099 It's a conundrum.
4060099 4062623 And some people like toast<br />with toppings.
4062623 4064408 Mm. Interesting.
4065235 4067889 The way we think about bread<br />has changed, so.
4068281 4071806 You want bread?<br />We've got bread.
4072590 4074331 - There you go.
4078770 4081077 - Ugh!
4081381 4083688 - Oh, it's like a rock.<br />- I couldn't even chew it.
4100357 4102794 - Can you see him?<br />-That's him.
4108321 4110062 Ah, he's coming out.
4117722 4119115 Oh, come on.
4158328 4159807 You keep a lookout.
4160286 4163463 Uh, I'm gonna go in<br />and try to talk to them.
4163985 4167163 If things get funny,<br />you go for help.
4167163 4170340 - How will I know?<br />- Well, you'll be with me.
4173343 4175345 Automated Voice:<br /><i>Microphone enabled.</i>
4178043 4179436 <i>Hearing aid connected.</i>
4200196 4201414 Hello?
4202328 4204852 <i>Thel, I think I see a door<br />in the back.</i>
4216037 4218562 <i>Lamp down ahead.<br />Lift those heels.</i>
4225308 4227440 <i>There's a stack<br />of loose Hummels, or...</i>
4227440 4228833 <i>or maybe they're gnomes</i>
4228833 4231488 <i>or some kind of<br />little animals.</i>
4231488 4232793 <i>Be... be careful.</i>
4242107 4243717 <i>Gets a little hairy up ahead.</i>
4244065 4245328 Take your time.
4251247 4252509 - Oh!
4253379 4254554 <i>What happened?</i>
4254989 4257731 Oh. W... what are you doing?
4257731 4259298 It's a mess.
4260299 4261822 Don't clean!
4261822 4264564 Well, you have to<br />with glass. It's not right.
4264564 4267741 <i>Not now.<br />Get your act together.</i>
4274966 4277577 <i>- Easy, easy.</i><br />-Ah.
4280798 4286238 Uh, yes! Ah!<br />Well done. Well done, Thel.
4286717 4288240 <i>Okay. Let's go.</i>
4290111 4291287 Yes, sir.
4292026 4294246 Hesitating is gonna cost you.
4294899 4296422 Yeah, quite a bit.
4297336 4301035 No, there's gonna be<br />some unpleasantness ahead.
4301035 4303429 I mean, we just don't want him<br />sitting in holding
4303429 4305388 any longer than he has to.
4305388 4308739 Yes, I know, but even<br />good boys make mistakes.
4316703 4319402 - Hi. May I help you?<br />- Who's that?
4319402 4322970 I'm Thelma. Thelma Post.
4324537 4325712 Huh.
4325712 4327714 You might recognize me.
4329063 4330674 From the telephone.
4331327 4335287 Hmm. No, I can't say<br />I do, ma'am.
4336027 4338029 Uh, at this moment in time,<br />we're closed.
4338029 4339465 But why don't you<br />come back tomorrow?
4339465 4341598 I've got a shipment of, uh,<br />what do you call them?
4341598 4344383 A woman inside a woman<br />inside a woman.
4344383 4347038 - Uh, Russian nesting dolls?<br />- Yeah.
4347038 4350128 Now, at least<br />I think they're women.<br />I mean, I haven't checked.
4350128 4352522 There may be a little fella<br />in there somewhere.
4352522 4354045 Where's my money?
4358441 4360399 - Sorry?<br />- You heard me.
4360399 4363359 Yes, I heard you.<br />I'm not sure I understood.
4363968 4365361 You called me.
4365970 4368233 You pretended<br />to be my grandson.
4369060 4371192 You took advantage of me.
4387557 4389646 That's a hefty accusation.
4390081 4392083 I think you've got<br />the wrong idea.
4392953 4396000 Listen, buddy,<br />I came a long way.
4397218 4399307 Hm,<br />well, you've made a mistake.
4399612 4402310 That's okay. You know,<br />I make mistakes, too.
4402310 4404878 But let's not make another.
4408621 4411319 I'm... I'm contacting<br />the authorities.
4416890 4418457 Well, what are you<br />gonna tell 'em?
4418457 4420024 You broke into my store?
4420024 4421547 <i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>
4421547 4423941 I'd like to report a robbery.<br />Ah! Uh, uh...
4425682 4426944 The... Thel?
4428424 4430121 Thel, are you there?
4430121 4433429 Look, I just want you to know<br />that it's not personal.
4433907 4436780 I mean, we're not<br />selling like we used to.
4436780 4438477 People these days, they...
4438477 4440523 they don't care<br />about old things.
4441001 4443526 I'm just trying<br />to keep the lights on.
4443526 4444962 We have a lot of lights.
4446137 4449662 - So, it's very expensive.<br />- Yeah. Thank you, Michael.
4451098 4454101 I bet this whole thing<br />has been a headache, huh?
4454101 4457670 Look, I don't expect you<br />to leave here empty-handed.
4458366 4460325 Why don't we make a deal, huh?
4460325 4461805 I'll keep your deposit,
4461805 4463807 but I'll cut you in<br />on the next one.
4464242 4466462 Yeah, I'm happy to negotiate.
4466462 4468159 I'll give you<br />the senior discount.
4468159 4470466 Well, that isn't gonna work<br />for me.
4471467 4472816 And you should know,
4472816 4474948 if I'm not out<br />in five minutes,
4474948 4477298 my partner calls the cops.
4478604 4479866 You want me to beg?
4481433 4482695 Then I'll beg.
4488092 4490877 Look, what do you<br />want me to do?
4490877 4492226 Give it back?
4492226 4494533 I'll lose the store.<br />I'll be out on the street.
4495316 4496753 Nobody cares.
4498145 4500017 Nobody cares about me.
4500539 4503194 Everybody's buying<br />their shit on Amazon.
4504021 4506545 I just take<br />what I need to survive.
4507067 4509548 So, why do you need it so bad?
4509548 4513378 Because it's mine,<br />and I decide who gets it.
4515336 4517034 You're being unreasonable.
4519253 4521429 Michael, get my keys.
4526826 4528262 Ah...
4529655 4531831 Uh, uh...
4531831 4533877 - Huh?<br />- No, no. I, uh...
4533877 4536183 How did I... huh.
4536749 4540144 Uh, I, uh... oh. Ah.
4540492 4543190 I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
4543190 4546542 I... I don't recognize<br />this pla...
4547151 4549240 Oh. I, uh...
4550284 4554462 I... I need to call<br />my husband.
4556334 4557988 Hm. Of course.
4558597 4560077 What's your name, dear?
4560077 4562166 - I'm Harvey.<br />- Harvey?
4562601 4565735 -Yeah.<br />- Harvey? Harvey.
4565735 4566953 Come and sit down now.
4566953 4568085 Harvey.
4568085 4569303 We'll call him.<br />Yeah, yeah.
4569303 4571436 Talk to me, Thel.<br />What's going on?
4577094 4579836 I'm terribly sorry<br />for the imposition.
4579836 4581664 Oh, please.<br />It's all right.
4581664 4583753 No. Happens to the best of us.
4583753 4585493 The mind is a funny thing.
4585493 4586756 Now,<br />what's your husband's number?
4586756 4588366 - I'll get you home.
4592892 4594633 My money, Harvey.
4597288 4599638 Michael! Coward.
4617656 4620311 You were<br />very convincing, Harvey.
4620311 4622095 Why, you could have<br />been an actor.
4622095 4625359 Not a star, maybe,<br />but even so, what a waste.
4625359 4627100 Do you know<br />how to use that thing?
4627710 4629755 - No.
4629755 4633498 Fuck! Jesus Christ!<br />Okay, okay, okay.
4633498 4634673 Where is it?
4636544 4638590 - In there.<br />- Where?
4638590 4641680 It's been deposited into<br />my account on the computer.
4641680 4643856 - Well, get it out.<br />- I can't.
4643856 4646554 - What do you mean, you can't?<br />- Michael does the computers.
4646554 4649427 Oh, this is ridiculous. Oh.
4655476 4658610 It's just me and you now.
4659350 4660612 And me.
4661831 4664660 - Who the fuck is that?<br />- My friend.
4665443 4670274 Here. Here, you take this.<br />I... I need both hands.
4670709 4673669 - What happened to Michael?<br />- I beat him up.
4674582 4678151 Where's the mouse?<br />There's the mouse.
4678804 4680327 Come on. Move.
4684636 4687595 What? What is that?<br />It's a shoe!
4687595 4689423 - It looks like a shoe.<br />- It's a shoe.
4689423 4691730 Ben, don't look at it.<br />Look at him.
4692122 4695299 W... what do I do with it?<br />I... I'm gonna "X" it.
4695299 4696648 No, no, don't do that!
4696648 4698563 Well, you don't know<br />what it is.
4706789 4708399 That's a baby.
4709661 4713230 Oh, God.<br />I don't know how to do this.
4722935 4723980 Hello?
4723980 4724981 <i>Danny?</i>
4724981 4726852 Grandma! Oh, my God.
4726852 4729812 Are you... okay?<br />Where are you?
4729812 4731509 <i>I'll tell you,</i>
4731509 4733554 <i>but you have to promise me<br />something.</i>
4733554 4734599 What?
4734599 4735948 <i>Come alone.</i>
4746785 4747917 -Huh.<br />-What?
4749135 4750528 His heart rate is slowing.
4753270 4754619 We're getting closer.
4754619 4756316 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- We're getting closer.
4756316 4758144 I just... okay,<br />now a little more,
4758144 4759972 little more, little more.<br />Ah! Ah!
4780558 4782212 Tell me<br />what you're looking at!
4782212 4785693 It... it's a family<br />and a baby,<br />and they're everywhere.
4785693 4787173 <i>Great, great. Are there words?</i>
4787173 4789785 Yeah, it says,<br />uh, Lincoln Mutual.
4789785 4793005 Yep! It's an ad.<br />You need to find the "X."
4793005 4796052 - Well, there's no red "X."<br />- No, but it's not always red.
4796052 4798576 Sometimes they hide it,<br />so look closer.
4801753 4803015 Top right.
4809065 4812372 - I "X"ed it.<br />-Great! Um...
4813025 4815549 -Remember the...
4815549 4817247 the computer's the library,
4817247 4819118 and the search bar's<br />the librarian.
4819118 4821860 <i>You're gonna ask it<br />for information,</i>
4821860 4823296 <i>and then it's gonna<br />give it to you.</i>
4823601 4824950 <i>Where is the bank?</i>
4824950 4827170 Ye... uh,<br />are you talking to me?
4827170 4829520 No, I... I'm asking<br />the machine.
4829520 4831217 It can't hear you.
4831217 4833916 Is there a Sari or a Siri,<br />or is she not in there?
4833916 4835613 She's not there.<br />That... that's in your phone.
4835613 4836657 But y... you don't need her.
4836657 4837876 <i>I don't talk to her.</i>
4837876 4839182 <i>She talks to me.</i>
4849757 4851194 "Valley...
4852108 4854458 financial...
4854458 4856503 dot-com.
4856503 4859463 Hit "Enter." You see "Enter"?
4861204 4862379 I'm in!
4875348 4876784 What's the password?
4876784 4878090 I don't know.
4878090 4881267 Look around you.<br />Is there, uh, a notebook
4881267 4884314 <i>or a desk, papers,<br />anything like that?</i>
4887143 4889449 - Oh, my God.<br />-<i>What?</i>
4889449 4891451 The password is "Password."
4891451 4893018 <i>Classic!</i>
4893018 4895542 Now, click inside of that box<br />and type that in.
4896935 4898371 That's cute.
4898371 4901505 Goddamn dumbass.<br />Password, Michael?
4908947 4910296 Come on!
4912603 4914866 I'm moving to "Transfer."
4916433 4918391 Oh, God.
4918391 4921742 - What?<br />- It wants me to join a gym!
4923135 4925007 No, I... I'm gonna tell it no.
4925007 4926965 Good. Remember what we do?
4926965 4929228 The "X," no matter the color.
4929228 4930577 <i>That's right!</i>
4933406 4935539 - I'm in.<br />- Yes!
4935539 4937062 <i>Be ready in five.</i>
4937062 4938324 Okay, I'll be there soon.
4944983 4947507 Oh, Jesus.
4973185 4974752 Uh, no! Oof.
4985763 4988070 I assume it was you
4988070 4990420 on the phone<br />pretending to be Danny.
4991987 4993989 He doesn't have the range.
4996382 4997949 I'm not your grandma.
4999690 5002084 But if I was, I'd tell you<br />there comes a time
5002084 5005304 when you can't listen<br />to anyone but yourself.
5013530 5015749 He called you a dumbass.
5017012 5019492 He said it quietly,<br />but I heard it.
5037075 5039991 Ah!
5040383 5042167 You're insane.
5055833 5058314 - Is that it?<br />- That's it.
5059271 5060968 And he can't get it back?
5071457 5072980 Hey, wait!
5075635 5079726 He can't get it back.
5085602 5087691 Don't take people's money.
5088518 5090041 Clean up your store.
5091042 5092783 Be nicer to Michael.
5093827 5097353 This whole thing<br />has been really ridiculous.
5099137 5102358 And don't smoke.
5125250 5127600 - What?<br />- I didn't say anything.
5127600 5128645 Oh.
5134129 5135434 Get in!
5147490 5148795 Did you get it?
5151842 5153060 We got it.
5156977 5159371 Oh, Danny, Danny,<br />you remember Ben.
5159371 5161808 Yeah. Hey, Ben,<br />it's really great to see you.
5161808 5163419 Good to see, Danny.<br />How you doing?
5163419 5166726 -I'm all right. Yeah.
5168511 5172863 Whoa. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.<br />We're famous.
5173342 5175300 - Ha, ha!
5175300 5176562 Hello!
5180827 5183874 Today was a good day.
5183874 5186093 I hope you know<br />I'm gonna buy you
5186093 5188313 a new scooter and a new phone.
5188313 5191621 Oh, well, maybe we can go out<br />to lunch someday.
5191621 5192883 I'd like that.
5192883 5196234 We could try<br />the famous Belwood cafeteria.
5196234 5198105 I hear they have<br />terrific melons.
5200499 5204199 - Or... we could go out.<br />- Both good options.
5204764 5207811 - We'll make a plan, dear.<br />- Good, good, good.
5207811 5210466 -Ah!
5213077 5214992 - You be well.<br />- I will.
5220650 5222042 Break a leg, Ben!
5227439 5229615 Does he know what that means?
5229615 5231008 I'm not sure.
5231791 5236361 He's new to the theater,<br />and his hip is titanium.
5237057 5238494 Detective Morgan:<br />But he didn't say anything?
5238494 5241018 No, but he... he...
5241018 5243238 Has Daniel ever wandered off<br />like this before?
5243238 5245152 Never. Not like this.
5247851 5250462 Oh, my God! Mom! Oh!
5252116 5253813 Your eye. Are you okay?
5253813 5255598 I'm all right, darling.<br />I'm all right.
5255598 5257817 Oh, we were so worried<br />about you!
5258253 5259602 Ah!
5271135 5272310 You drove.
5273180 5274225 I did.
5275966 5277924 You went back to the buffet.
5282320 5283321 I did.
5283321 5285323 - What happened?
5285323 5287412 Well,<br />I'll tell you everything,
5287412 5289240 but there's something<br />I'd like to do first,
5289240 5290763 if you would indulge me.
5290763 5291895 Of course!
5292678 5295377 I'm just Annie,<br />Mr. Warbucks, sir.
5295377 5297770 I'm sorry I'm not a... a boy.
5297770 5300033 It's her<br />first night here, sir.
5300033 5303210 Well, Annie, how would you<br />like to go to a movie?
5304386 5307650 And then you could go<br />to The Roxy
5307650 5313569 and then some ice cream soda<br />at Rumpelmayer's,
5313569 5317573 and then a cab ride<br />around Central Park.
5322273 5323622 Um, well...
5325581 5326712 Yeah, wow.
5327452 5330542 Golly. Golly, Daddy,<br />Mr. Warbucks.
5331717 5333893 - It's a strange show!
5389732 5391516 I'm glad to come here.
5393736 5395477 These are good graves.
5396782 5398044 Do you like them?
5398044 5399437 Yeah. As in, what?
5399437 5400786 Do I want to be buried<br />in them?
5400786 5403441 I got a ton of graves.
5403441 5404964 Oh, yeah?
5405661 5407271 Beautiful graves.
5408011 5409229 Some here.
5410317 5412319 Mostly back in New York.
5413103 5417237 Uh, does Allie plan on being<br />buried in a Jewish cemetery?
5417237 5418630 Oh, I don't know, you know?
5418630 5420980 We haven't really had<br />the graves conversation yet.
5420980 5422373 - Taking it slow.
