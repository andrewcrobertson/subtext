58211 59740 <i>- Seq, I'm in.<br />- Captain.</i>
59843 60843 <i>You were right.</i>
60920 62212 <i>The skylight was a window pane.</i>
62300 63651 <i>I've got serious interference.</i>
63729 65739 <i>Weird.<br />It's some kind of Modal.</i>
65890 67686 <i>Looks like old code.</i>
67770 69146 <i>It feels really familiar.</i>
69229 70841 <i>Drop a pin.<br />I'll signal for backup.</i>
70929 72363 <i>- I'm gonna check it out.<br />- Bugs?</i>
72442 74085 <i>If the general finds out<br />we've been fishing...</i>
74109 75778 <i>A quick peek can't hurt.</i>
75861 77154 <i>Did you hear that?</i>
77237 78704 <i>Shit. I think<br />our signal was traced.</i>
78804 80824 <i>Bugs, this feels like a trap.</i>
80908 82034 <i>Bugs!</i>
121990 124353 Freeze!<br />Do not move!
124443 125533 We will shoot!
125639 128914 Very slowly, raise your hands.
142803 144388 Here we go.
150080 151420 Hey, where are you going?
151772 153081 You were warned, Lieutenant.
153169 155351 I think we can handle<br />one little girl.
158451 159571 You're wasting your time!
159661 161519 My men are bringing her<br />down now.
162189 163350 No, Lieutenant,
164491 166353 your men are already dead.
177045 178200 Seq, you with me?
178290 179590 This old code keeps crashing.
179680 181234 Your projection's breaking up.<br />Switch to audio.
181258 182593 Bugs, this is a direct violation
182676 183927 of the general's protocols.
184011 185429 I know, I know.
185512 187139 But something is happening here.
187921 189686 Something important.
189790 190934 Oh, fuck.
191018 192603 We know what happens next.
192686 194354 She kicks their ass.
216877 218295 Now she makes a call.
218378 219630 The line was traced.
219713 221965 - And then...<br />- Then she runs for her life.
222049 223383 Are there any agents?
223467 224885 We know this story.
226428 228055 This is how it all began.
228764 230599 God damn it.
230682 232142 This is where he began.
232225 235479 You're thinking this Modal<br />is a loop? Or a treadmill?
235562 239107 Some sort of sequencer<br />evolving a program to do what?
239191 240359 I don't know.
241526 243153 But I'm going to find out.
243236 244363 All right.
274977 277354 So deja vu and yet it's<br />obviously all wrong.
277437 279606 Why use old code<br />to mirror something new?
279690 281316 I don't know.
294705 296039 If that's supposed<br />to be Trinity,
296123 297666 that's not what happens.
299626 301586 Maybe this isn't the story<br />we think it is.
301670 304047 Bugs, you have<br />to get out of here.
304131 306383 It's gotta be a trap.
307801 308844 Shit.
346548 347883 Uh...
347966 349760 You all carry on.
349843 350844 As you were.
353847 355390 I'm just gonna...
356308 358060 see myself out.
358143 359144 Kill her.
393303 395097 Oh, Seq!
462789 464207 - Why did you save me?<br />- You first.
464291 466042 Who are you?<br />Where did you come from?
466126 467669 Okay.
467752 469504 My name is Bugs.
469588 471882 As in "Bunny."
471965 473675 And tech that listens.
474759 476720 Do you know this is a Modal?
477971 479097 What's a Modal?
479181 481474 It's a simulation<br />used to evolve programs.
485270 487230 Do you understand<br />that you are...
488148 489816 digital sentience?
489900 491568 I know what I am.
491651 492903 Just like I know my job
492986 495071 is to hunt down<br />and destroy synthients.
495155 496406 Like you.
500577 502120 And yet...
503872 505207 Here we are.
505290 506708 Here we are.
508168 510462 The other agents<br />don't know about this room?
512422 513590 How'd you find it?
513673 516176 No one was ever in the key shop,
516259 517469 so I started looking.
518637 520722 More you looked,<br />the more you found.
521765 523350 Story of my life.
530482 531483 What?
533652 535237 I feel like I know this room.
543870 546289 Holy shit.
548667 550126 This is his apartment.
551378 553463 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
553546 555507 I searched everywhere.<br />He doesn't exist.
555590 557842 He stopped being Thomas<br />a long time ago,
557926 560303 but maybe you know him<br />by his real name.
561054 562138 Neo.
563598 564849 You do.
565934 567519 Oh, okay.
568186 569479 Uh...
569562 572190 I can't believe this,<br />after all these years.
572274 575944 You see, most people<br />think that Neo is dead.
577279 578697 But I know he's not.
579656 581408 Because I've seen him.
583660 585453 Where?
585537 588081 It's not something<br />I can explain easily, but...
592586 595714 <i>But the moment he looked at me,</i>
595797 597424 I felt something...
600760 602470 unlock my mind.
605015 606099 Okay.
608393 610353 Something like that<br />happened to me.
615275 616943 <i>I saw this pattern...</i>
618236 619654 <i>and it was everywhere.</i>
621281 623658 We can't see it,<br />but we're all trapped inside
623742 626286 these strange, repeating loops.
626369 629622 Somehow I saw it in the mirror.
629706 632459 Just a flicker,<br />but it was like you said.
637964 640342 And suddenly I understood.
640425 642886 This is not the real world.
645347 648683 <i>For the first time,<br />I felt real purpose.</i>
649351 651311 I knew who I was
651394 653313 and what I had to do.
653980 655398 Who are you?
656733 658443 What do you have to do?
661404 662697 I am...
663490 664866 Morpheus.
665992 668286 And I have to find Neo.
672457 673792 Morpheus.
676753 678380 Okay. Okay.
678463 679547 Oh, my God!
679631 680924 I have to get you out of here.
681007 683426 I need to figure out<br />who built this Modal.
683510 685095 Okay, come with me.
685178 687365 You have to be ready to leave.<br />You have to be really ready.
687389 688681 And if you're not,
688765 690525 if you think that<br />this is where you belong...
693269 694687 You call this a choice?
694771 696332 Oh, honestly, when somebody<br />offered me these things,
696356 697917 I went off on binary<br />conceptions of the world
697941 699581 and said there was no way<br />I was swallowing
699609 701486 some symbolic reduction<br />of my life.
701569 702963 And the woman<br />with the pills laughed
702987 704215 'cause I was missing the point.
704239 705782 What point?
705865 708785 The choice is an illusion.
708868 711079 You already know<br />what you have to do.
717836 718920 Truth.
725635 726636 Okay.
726719 727929 There's an old building
728012 729597 with a skylight<br />and lots of stairs.
729681 730890 The Lafayette.
730974 732517 One of the four back doors<br />leads there.
733351 734477 Oh.
734561 736122 - Don't fight it.<br />- Whoa, what's happening?
736146 737230 Keep breathing.
737313 738749 Extraction works<br />pretty much the same
738773 740692 for humans and programs.
743528 744529 Ouch.
744612 745655 Ah.
747073 748366 Okay.
750910 752328 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
752412 754205 I've never worn<br />different glasses before.
754289 757041 Yeah, looks good.<br />Which door?
757125 758918 - It's gotta be...<br />- Okay.
763965 765675 Agent White.
765758 766968 Agent Smith?
772682 774142 Go!
781357 783026 Seq! Can you hear me?
783109 784360 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
784444 785754 Can you get us<br />to the window pane?
785778 787739 Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!
797916 800168 That window! Go hard!
846381 848841 What the...
855139 857100 What the hell?
873950 875285 Something wrong?
875368 878121 Uh... Just a little crash.
878204 880582 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
880665 884460 What a beautiful day<br />to be alive. Am I right?
884544 886546 - Problemo?<br />- He lost something.
887880 889173 Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?
891175 892760 A little Modal experiment.
892844 895805 For <i>Binary?</i>
895888 898516 - I need a coffee.<br />- Coffee. Yes, stat!
898600 899726 I'm buying.
902729 904480 I'm not trying to blow<br />smoke up your ass,
904564 908985 but the first time I played<br />the trilogy, I was shook.
909068 911654 The paradox<br />between free will and destiny.
911738 912905 Are we all just algorithms
912989 914229 doing what we're supposed to do
914282 915992 or can we escape<br />our programming?
916075 919996 Genius, inside the context<br />of the game, BT dubs.
920079 922165 Hey, did I tell you<br />it took over my life?
922248 925001 Yeah. I failed<br />the seventh grade.
925084 927253 Your game almost ruined me.
927337 929839 - So you've said.<br />- Yet here we are.
929922 932759 You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
932842 933885 is it free will
935136 936763 or destiny?
941434 943353 Oh, yeah.
943436 945355 There she is.
945438 946939 Total f-ing MILF.
947815 949901 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
949984 952278 I'm a geek.<br />I was raised by machines.
952362 953613 Maybe you should go.
953696 956741 No, please.<br />I... I promise, best self.
956824 958076 Best self.
961996 963247 Sure.
964123 965541 You ever talk to her?
967669 969087 Tell you what.
969170 973549 For all you've done for me,<br />let me do this for you.
973633 976386 Jude, no. Stop.
976469 978179 - Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Thanks.
978262 979681 Hi. Um...
979764 981349 I know this is all<br />a bit extemporaneous.
981432 983059 I'm Jude Gallagher.
983142 985728 I work for a game company<br />called Deus Machina.
985812 987063 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
987146 990066 Tiffany. Wow.<br />Didn't see that coming.
990149 992068 - Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.<br />- Jude.
992151 996072 Oh, and this is my very<br />good friend, Thomas Anderson.
996155 998074 He is a bona fide famous person
998157 999534 and considered by most to be
999617 1001619 the greatest game designer<br />of our generation.
1001703 1002912 I'm sorry about this.
1002995 1004205 - Jude...<br />- Just talk to her.
1004288 1006791 Hi, Thomas.<br />Everyone calls me "Tiff."
1007667 1008876 Hi.
1016050 1017176 Have we met?
1018636 1020763 Uh, we both come here.
1020847 1022287 - Can I have your morning bun?<br />- Hey!
1022348 1023826 Are you trying<br />to ball my mom or what?
1023850 1025143 Brandon!
1025226 1027103 Can I have one bite?
1027186 1030189 Babe! What's going on?<br />We're gonna be late.
1030273 1032191 This is my husband, Chad.
1032275 1034068 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hey.
1035695 1037780 Babe, we gotta get<br />Callie to practice.
1037864 1039949 Right. Sorry.
1040033 1041659 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1066017 1067018 What?
1074484 1076819 Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.
1082742 1085828 "Billions of people<br />just living out their lives...
1087038 1088873 oblivious."
1090833 1093211 I always loved that line.
1093294 1094754 You wrote that one, yeah?
1097465 1099634 Every time I stand here,
1099717 1102970 I mean, O-M-G.
1103054 1105097 It's so perfect,<br />it's gotta be fake.
1106140 1107558 Right?
1109435 1110686 Yeah.
1111437 1112688 Sure.
1112772 1114607 Have a seat.
1117610 1118820 Smoke?
1120112 1121155 I thought you quit.
1122031 1124408 I quit calling it a habit.
1124492 1126410 Now it's just a guilty pleasure.
1128579 1132166 Oh. Maybe I can make this<br />easy for you.
1132250 1134293 I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.
1134377 1136671 This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.<br />It's bigger than that.
1136754 1138089 This is about our future,
1138172 1141133 which is a sticky subject,<br />given our past.
1141217 1142426 What do you mean?
1143553 1145138 How's the therapy?
1145221 1146514 Good.
1147223 1148683 Any...
1149642 1150977 episodes?
1152770 1153855 No.
1154480 1156274 That's terrific.
1157984 1161487 Look, Tom, I know we've<br />always had our differences.
1161571 1163406 What did you say<br />about our first meeting?
1163489 1166742 We had all the chemistry<br />of an FBI interrogation.
1169453 1170872 But look at this place.
1171956 1173291 We did this.
1174667 1175877 Together.
1177253 1178713 Yeah.
1178796 1180756 Now what?
1180840 1184427 Things have changed.<br />The market's tough.
1184510 1186804 I'm sure you can understand<br />why our beloved
1186888 1188264 parent company, Warner Bros.,
1188347 1190766 has decided to make<br />a sequel to the trilogy.
1190850 1192268 What?
1192351 1194329 They informed me they're gonna<br />do it with or without us.
1194353 1196188 I thought they couldn't do that.
1197398 1198774 Oh, they can.
1198858 1200192 And they made it clear
1200276 1202445 they'll kill our contract<br />if we don't cooperate.
1202528 1204238 Really?
1204322 1208200 I know you said the story<br />was over for you,
1208284 1210453 but that's the thing<br />about stories.
1212246 1214165 They never really end, do they?
1214248 1216792 We're still telling the same<br />stories we've always told,
1216876 1221172 just with different names,<br />different faces
1222798 1225885 and I have to say<br />I'm kind of excited.
1228721 1229889 After all these years,
1229972 1232975 to be going back<br />to where it all started.
1233059 1235394 Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>
1236520 1238230 I've spoken to Marketing...
1244195 1245738 Tom?
1245821 1247365 Yeah.
1247448 1248491 Are you all right?
1250826 1251953 Yeah.
1256874 1259085 What were you feeling<br />at that point?
1262171 1263965 What was I feeling?
1267259 1272014 I felt either I'm having<br />a mental breakdown again
1272098 1276352 or I'm living inside<br />a computer-generated reality
1276435 1277979 that has imprisoned me...
1278604 1279772 again.
1290449 1291951 Not much of a choice.
1292034 1293244 No.
1293327 1294912 Maybe it's not<br />as binary as that.
1294996 1298290 Maybe there are other ways<br />to understand what happened.
1298874 1299959 Yeah.
1300042 1302211 Thomas, you are<br />a suicide survivor
1302294 1305172 gifted with<br />a powerful imagination.
1305256 1307008 Those facts have combined
1307091 1309593 to create dangerous fictions<br />in your life.
1309677 1311220 Yesterday,<br />you walked into a meeting
1311303 1312430 with your business partner
1312513 1313973 and he ambushed you,
1314056 1316475 demanding you make a game<br />you said you would never make.
1316559 1319895 This attack effectively<br />took away your voice.
1319979 1322732 His violence triggered you<br />and your mind fought back.
1322815 1324692 You did to him<br />what he was doing to you.
1326193 1327570 We've talked about the value
1327653 1331198 of adaptive anger<br />in healing trauma.
1331282 1334660 Far from suggesting a repeat<br />of your initial breakdown,
1334744 1335953 I believe this episode
1336037 1337830 demonstrates healthy<br />self-protection.
1339373 1341584 And more importantly,<br />I remember how hard
1341667 1344712 it was for you<br />to share something like this.
1344795 1347506 Which tells me<br />just how far we've come.
1352595 1354889 Do you need a refill<br />on your prescription?
1356766 1357933 Yeah.
1380539 1382750 First of all, I know<br />I speak for everyone
1382833 1385127 when I say that<br />I'm so, so excited
1385211 1387296 to be working on a game<br />that was such a...
1387379 1389465 well, game changer.
1389548 1391133 Now, the packet in front of you
1391217 1394011 has our focus group research.
1394095 1395554 Inside, you'll find<br />the breakdown
1395638 1398474 including keyword association<br />with the brand.
1398557 1401644 The top two being<br />"originality" and "fresh,"
1401727 1403771 which I think are great things<br />to keep in mind
1403854 1406065 as you begin<br />working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>
1407608 1409193 And who knows how many more?
1424708 1428129 What made <i>Matrix</i> different?<br />It effed with your head.
1428212 1429505 On point.
1429588 1431590 People want us<br />up in their grey space,
1431674 1434718 switching their synaptic<br />"WTF" light on.
1443853 1447189 What made <i>Matrix</i> different?<br />It effed with your head.
1447273 1449108 People want us<br />up in their grey space,
1449191 1450526 switching their synaptic
1450609 1453237 "What the hell<br />is going on here?" light on.
1463330 1467543 I didn't love the first one,<br />like some of you.
1467626 1470045 And, frankly,<br />I've got zero tolerance
1470129 1472548 for anything that requires<br />a syllabus and a highlighter.
1472631 1474508 I like my games big,<br />loud and dumb.
1474592 1476552 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1476635 1479221 <i>Matrix</i> means mayhem.
1483893 1486061 Mindless action is not on-brand.
1486145 1487563 She's right.
1487646 1490691 <i>Matrix</i> is mind-porn.<br />Philosophy in shiny...
1490774 1492443 - tight PVC.<br />- Yeah.
1492526 1494403 Ideas are the new "sexy."
1508542 1510252 Obviously <i>The Matrix</i> is about...
1510336 1512588 - trans-politics.<br />- Crypto-fascism.
1512671 1513589 It's a metaphor...
1513672 1515341 of capitalist exploitation.
1527811 1532191 This cannot be another reboot,<br />retread, regurgitated...
1532274 1534360 Why not? Reboots sell.
1537488 1539549 We are so far down the wrong<br />rabbit hole, here, people.
1539573 1543410 You say <i>Matrix</i> to anyone...<br />You say <i>Matrix...</i>
1543494 1546455 Matrix...<br />Matrix... Matrix...
1546538 1548374 this is what they see.
1555047 1557341 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
1557424 1559593 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1560261 1561303 That's two words.
1565307 1568477 We need a new "bullet time."
1571063 1574984 We need to revolutionize<br />gaming again.
1575067 1578862 Revolutionize gaming again!
1604763 1606515 <i>Afternoon, Tiff.</i>
1606598 1607766 The ushe?
1607850 1610019 You know what, Skroce?<br />I'm going wild.
1610102 1612604 I'll have a cortado today.
1612688 1615232 Fly that freak flag.
1615316 1617067 Mind if I get that?
1617151 1618193 Oh, hi.
1619194 1621196 Hi.
1621280 1623782 I remember wanting a family,
1623866 1625159 but was that because
1625242 1627911 that's what women<br />are supposed to want?
1627995 1629764 How do you know<br />if you want something yourself
1629788 1632916 or if your upbringing<br />programmed you to want it?
1633000 1634001 Mmm.
1635044 1637004 I pay my analyst a lot of money
1637087 1639673 to answer such questions for me.
1639757 1640966 Smart.
1641050 1642259 I should get more therapy
1642343 1644762 but honestly,<br />I'm too goddamn tired.
1644845 1646597 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1648182 1650434 No. Never had kids.
1650517 1653270 Oh, right, I knew that.
1653354 1655814 Sorry. I googled you.
1657775 1660361 So, what's it like being<br />a world-famous game designer?
1660444 1662988 - Must be amazing.<br />- Uh...
1663072 1664573 A lot of hours.
1664656 1666700 Sometimes it is amazing.
1666784 1668285 Most times...
1669495 1670788 I don't know.
1670871 1673374 But you made <i>The Matrix.</i><br />Even I've heard of that.
1673457 1677252 Yeah. We kept<br />some kids entertained.
1677336 1679463 So, worth it?
1685803 1688389 Can I ask something<br />about your game?
1688472 1689723 Sure.
1689807 1692059 Did you base your<br />main character on yourself?
1697189 1699191 There is a lot of me in him.
1701693 1704863 Maybe a little too much.
1706865 1708617 Can I ask you something else?
1708700 1709910 Please.
1711620 1713914 There's a woman in your game.
1715124 1716125 Trinity.
1717960 1720712 Which is a weird<br />coincidence also, right?
1722256 1723382 God, yeah.
1724758 1726009 I like her.
1727219 1729513 - I like Trinity.<br />- Ah.
1729596 1730848 And I dig her Ducati.
1730931 1733934 Another coincidence.<br />I love motorcycles.
1737229 1739940 My friend Kush and I<br />actually build them.
1740023 1741150 Really?
1741233 1744611 You have your analyst,<br />I have my bikes.
1744695 1749324 So, I was looking at images<br />from your game. At Trinity.
1751034 1752619 Well, I showed Chad a scene,
1752703 1754746 and I was like,<br />"So, what do you think?"
1755831 1758333 He didn't get it until I said,
1758417 1760419 "Don't you think<br />she looks like me?"
1762254 1763964 You know what he did?
1765299 1766550 He laughed.
1771263 1774141 And I laughed too,<br />like it was a joke.
1774224 1775767 How could it not be, right?
1777978 1779605 Made me so angry.
1781106 1783442 I hated myself for laughing.
1785110 1788197 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1789490 1790782 Not too hard.
1790866 1794077 Maybe just hard enough<br />to break his jaw off.
1797289 1799124 And right now,<br />you're probably regretting
1799208 1800709 sitting down with me.
1802878 1806757 This is the best thing<br />I've done in a long time.
1811136 1812846 I have to take this.
1816475 1817559 Hi, this is Tiff.
1817643 1818727 Oh, God, no.
1820771 1822773 I'll be right there.
1822856 1825692 My, uh, youngest<br />stuck a Lego up his nose.
1826610 1827861 Oh.
1829279 1830322 I gotta go.
1832491 1835118 I hope I see you again.
1853053 1854179 <i>There has been a report</i>
1854263 1855764 <i>of an emergency.</i>
1855847 1857766 <i>Proceed calmly<br />to the nearest exit</i>
1857849 1859893 <i>and leave the building<br />immediately.</i>
1859977 1861353 What's going on?
1861436 1863331 We probably just got swatted<br />by some 14-year-old.
1863355 1864999 Yeah, someone pissed<br />about the latest update.
1865023 1866441 Or they're just a dick.
1866525 1869278 Please move to the exits.<br />Building's being evacuated.
1890549 1892217 Sir, this way.
1898056 1899224 Jude?
1900726 1901810 Jude!
1908275 1910235 At last.
1912070 1913322 Ah.
1913405 1914865 I wasn't too sure<br />about the callback,
1914948 1916950 but, you know,<br />it was hard to resist.
1917034 1918160 What?
1918243 1919661 Morpheus Uno.<br />Reveal at the window.
1919745 1922205 Lightning, thunder and theater.
1922289 1924166 At last.
1924249 1926668 All these years later,<br />here's me,
1926752 1929004 strolling out of a toilet stall.
1929087 1930213 Tragedy or farce?
1930297 1931923 I know you.
1932007 1934009 Not every day<br />you meet your maker.
1934092 1935260 This can't be happening.
1935344 1937012 Oh, most definitely is.
1937095 1939556 You can't be<br />a character I coded.
1939640 1941683 100% natural.
1949149 1950359 How?
1950442 1952611 All the explanation you need.
1955822 1957449 Oh.
1957532 1958700 No.
1958784 1960535 No, no, no.
1960619 1962412 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />What do you mean, "no"?
1962496 1965123 You wanted this, you did this.<br />This was your idea.
1965207 1969544 It was a test. An experiment.
1970837 1972047 An experiment?
1973590 1975550 You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,
1975634 1977010 left me to bang my head till
1977094 1979346 I nearly lost my shit<br />searching for you
1979429 1980931 as an experiment.
1981014 1983076 - The exit's breaking down.<br />- He hasn't taken the pill.
1983100 1984434 What? There's no time.
1984518 1986561 I know, I know.<br />He's having a moment.
1986645 1989106 Does he know how hard it was<br />to hack that mirror?
1991441 1993068 Still open.
1993151 1996571 This... This can't be real.
1996655 1998490 Target acquired.<br />We got him.
2006081 2007416 This isn't happening.
2007499 2009960 It's in my mind.<br />It's in my mind.
2010043 2011253 Hey, you!<br />Stop! Hold it!
2027352 2028895 This can't be happening.
2032023 2033775 Freeze! Don't move!
2042743 2043869 Neo!
2058759 2060177 Oh, my God!
2094920 2096004 Neo!
2100884 2103094 Mr. Anderson!
2103929 2105180 No!
2105263 2106306 It can't be.
2115106 2116942 I've missed you.
2132207 2133875 It's in my mind.
2135001 2136378 It's in my mind.
2144553 2146054 Can you hear me, Thomas?
2147305 2150100 Follow my voice.
2150183 2153895 Feel the tips of your fingers.<br />What are they touching?
2155939 2157315 The bell.
2159818 2161236 Do you hear the bell?
2164656 2167701 Do you remember what happened?<br />How you got here?
2169327 2170620 You must have walked.
2170704 2171913 I heard Deja Vu outside,
2171997 2173357 opened my door,<br />and there you were.
2178587 2181423 You feel like<br />you can talk about it?
2181506 2182786 When we started<br />working together,
2182841 2184593 you had lost your capacity
2184676 2187220 to discern reality from fiction.
2187304 2190473 You came to me after<br />trying to jump off a building.
2190557 2192851 You said you wanted to fly away.
2206197 2208950 We have made<br />a lot of progress since then,
2209034 2211369 but you seem particularly<br />triggered right now.
2211453 2212913 Can you tell me how it started?
2214915 2216625 He texted me.
2217792 2219127 Who?
2219210 2220670 Morpheus.
2220754 2221838 Ah.
2223548 2224925 So, he's back.
2225008 2227177 It wasn't actually him.
2228345 2231640 It was a program<br />I coded for a Modal.
2231723 2233892 And this "Modal," Morpheus,
2233975 2235977 came to help you escape
2236061 2239689 from a virtual reality<br />called <i>The Matrix.</i>
2249741 2251785 Am I crazy?
2251868 2254329 We don't use that word in here.
2254412 2257332 What word should I use?
2257415 2260752 What word explains<br />what is happening to me?
2260835 2262504 Can I see the texts?
2264965 2266508 They were erased.
2271763 2275100 If we got in my car<br />and drove to your office,
2275183 2277143 what do you think<br />we'd find there?
2277227 2278269 Nothing.
2280981 2283066 Because there was no attack.
2284275 2285860 No one was killed.
2286778 2288905 No one texted.
2288989 2291032 My mind made it all up.
2292450 2295120 Is that what<br />I'm supposed to say?
2295203 2296705 Is that what you believe?
2297497 2299374 It felt real.
2299457 2301209 Of course.
2301292 2304212 It was your great ambition<br />to make a game
2304295 2306673 that was indistinguishable<br />from reality.
2306756 2308216 To achieve this goal,
2308299 2310760 you converted elements<br />of your life into narrative.
2310844 2313096 Your sublimated anger<br />toward your business partner
2313179 2315390 cast him as your nemesis.
2315473 2317100 A married woman named Tiffany
2317183 2320520 became the "Trinity"<br />of a doomed romance.
2320603 2324774 Even your dislike of my cat<br />made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>
2324858 2326651 There's nothing wrong with that.
2326735 2328194 It's what artists do.
2328278 2331656 But it becomes a problem<br />when fantasies
2331740 2334075 endanger us or other people.
2336327 2338705 We don't want anyone<br />to get hurt,
2338788 2340165 do we, Thomas?
2348256 2350383 Hi, Thomas.<br />Everyone calls me "Tiff."
2350467 2352886 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
2352969 2354596 <i>No one can tell you<br />you're in love.</i>
2354679 2357182 You just know it,<br />through and through.
2357265 2359768 Balls to bones.
2359851 2361644 <i>You feel this?</i>
2363354 2365065 I'm never letting go.
2372739 2374783 <i>You have to let it all go, Neo.</i>
2374866 2377243 Free your mind.
2396012 2397472 Huh.
2397555 2399557 Looks easy enough.
2406397 2409025 "Free my mind." Shit.
2414197 2416241 Okay.
2416324 2417742 Free my mind.
2433967 2435510 I fly...
2436427 2438346 or I fall.
2446146 2447397 Who the hell are you?
2448273 2450358 You won't remember me,
2450441 2453695 but a long time ago,<br />you changed my life
2453778 2456156 when you leapt off another roof.
2456239 2459159 <i>Back then, I was just like<br />any other coppertop,</i>
2459242 2460952 <i>pretending my life...</i>
2461035 2465165 until I looked up and I saw you.
2465248 2467750 <i>It was a different you,<br />but I saw</i>
2468543 2470295 the real you,
2470378 2472172 just a second before...
2473631 2474716 you leapt.
2479470 2481264 And you never fell.
2486561 2488730 Are you the one<br />that hacked my Modal?
2489314 2490315 Yeah.
2491816 2493359 That'll be Jude.
2493443 2494777 He's not your friend.
2494861 2496380 He's a handle,<br />a program used to control you.
2496404 2497447 He's on his way here,
2497530 2499365 and he's bringing<br />Agents with him.
2500825 2502076 Jude.
2502160 2503600 <i>Bro, I've been calling you<br />all night.</i>
2503661 2505371 <i>We have a major problemo.</i>
2506915 2508499 Are you alone?
2511252 2514047 <i>That's kind<br />of a sexy question, dude.</i>
2514130 2516424 They don't look like<br />typical Agents.
2516507 2517985 They use bots now,<br />skinned as normal people,
2518009 2519195 which means they're everywhere
2519219 2521471 and you never know who to trust.
2521554 2523306 Why should I trust you?
2525391 2528478 Because if they open<br />that door, we lose our hack.
2528561 2530271 I will be caught and killed
2530355 2531564 and you will be put right back
2531648 2532958 on that treadmill<br />they designed for you,
2532982 2534168 just like they did the last time
2534192 2535432 you tried to leap your way out.
2536694 2539113 I know why you left<br />your Modal open.
2539197 2541658 You needed someone else<br />to free Morpheus.
2541741 2543844 And it's because of him that<br />we were able to get to you.
2543868 2545745 I know these things the same way
2545828 2548581 that I knew one day<br />I would find you.
2548665 2551292 And that when I did,<br />you would be ready for this.
2555880 2557257 If you want the truth, Neo,
2558508 2560510 you're going<br />to have to follow me.
2562053 2563054 Okay.
2582573 2585201 - Where are we?<br />- Tokyo.
2585285 2587120 A moving portal<br />makes it harder to track us.
2587203 2589831 - Seq is the best of them.<br />- Portal's clean.
2589914 2591332 Reading our shadows.
2592834 2595336 I don't remember this.
2595420 2597714 We don't have to run to<br />phone booths anymore, either.
2607307 2608766 Door's on your right.
2622989 2625366 Set and setting, right?
2625450 2626743 Oh, no.
2626826 2628286 It's all about set
2629120 2630371 and setting.
2630455 2632582 After our first contact<br />went so badly,
2632665 2634542 we thought elements<br />from your past
2634625 2636127 might help ease you<br />into the present.
2636210 2639047 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2639130 2640548 a little nostalgia.
2640631 2642967 This is footage from your game.
2650183 2652185 Time is always against us,
2653061 2655104 etcetera, etcetera.
2656314 2657440 No one can be told
2657523 2660818 what the Matrix is,<br />blah, blah, blah.
2663404 2665365 You gotta see it to believe it.
2668993 2670578 Time to fly.
2672622 2674082 Wait.
2674165 2675416 If this is real,
2675500 2678127 if I haven't lost my mind,<br />does that mean
2679837 2681214 this happened?
2690056 2691682 But if it did...
2695812 2697355 then we died.
2697438 2699357 Obviously not.
2699440 2700858 Why the Machines kept you alive
2700942 2703820 and why they went<br />to such lengths to hide you
2703903 2705738 are questions<br />we don't have answers to.
2705822 2707407 Hide me?
2707490 2711786 I've been at a company making<br />a game called <i>The Matrix.</i>
2711869 2714455 Doesn't seem like they were<br />trying to hide anything.
2714539 2716141 We've been tracking<br />that company for years.
2716165 2718960 We screened every<br />Thomas Anderson we found.
2719043 2720628 What we didn't understand
2720711 2723214 was that they could<br />alter your DSI.
2723297 2725049 Pods generate<br />your digital self-image
2725133 2727635 through a feedback system<br />called Semblance.
2727718 2729720 This is how<br />you look to yourself.
2729804 2733516 Somehow they were able<br />to alter your DSI loop.
2733599 2736102 This is how<br />everyone else sees you.
2750199 2752160 Twenty years?
2753453 2756998 Why did it take 20 years<br />to find me?
2757081 2758916 It took a lot longer than that.
2759000 2761002 It's been over 60 years<br />since you and Trinity
2761085 2762837 flew to one<br />of the Machine Cities.
2763546 2764546 What?
2764589 2766799 There's so much we don't know.
2766883 2768634 Like why you've barely aged,
2768718 2770928 or how many times<br />they've altered your DSI.
2771012 2772346 But based on what we do know,
2772430 2773764 it appears no one found you
2773848 2775683 because you didn't<br />want to be found.
2775766 2778519 - That's not true.<br />- Maybe it isn't.
2778603 2779812 Maybe there's no foundation
2779896 2781123 to the rumors<br />that you disappeared,
2781147 2782315 because you were working
2782398 2783838 with the Machines<br />from the beginning.
2783900 2785026 Morpheus, stop.
2785109 2788237 All I'm saying is<br />this is the moment
2788321 2790865 for you to show us what is real.
2790948 2793159 If you want out,
2793242 2794619 you'll take this pill.
2796120 2798539 But if you are where you belong,
2798623 2800792 you can go back to this.
2800875 2802210 Every day.
2802293 2805922 Over and over forever.
2809383 2810593 Fuck.
2820645 2821812 Keep the loop tight.
2834242 2835409 Cybebe needs that tower pin.
2835493 2837370 I got a signal. It's faint.
2837453 2838913 It's definitely off-grid.
2845795 2848214 Captain. I'm tracking<br />a whole lot of weird.
2848297 2849757 - What?<br />- It's some kind of graft.
2856013 2857306 Thomas?
2858474 2860268 Oh, God.
2860893 2862603 Oh, no.
2863938 2866107 - We got company.<br />- How'd they find us?
2867400 2870278 Thomas, none of this is real.
2870361 2874574 You are in the midst<br />of a serious psychotic break.
2874657 2876742 - Lexy?<br />- Almost there.
2876826 2878911 Thomas?
2878995 2881831 Thomas, please.<br />This is not a game.
2881914 2883416 Feel my hand.
2883499 2884709 This is what is real.
2887712 2889505 Stay with me.
2889589 2891215 No. No.
2894093 2895303 Stay with me.
2897972 2898973 Neo!
2902685 2903686 Morpheus!
2905229 2906647 Let's go, let's go!
2937053 2939138 - Bots are being activated.<br />- It's a swarm.
2963287 2964372 Come on!
2997822 2999323 I got a hack<br />in the bathroom. Hurry!
2999407 3000408 Yes.
3001200 3002201 Come on!
3004245 3005287 Seq, where?
3007415 3009083 - That mirror.<br />- What?
3009166 3010918 - We'll never fit.<br />- You gotta fit,
3011001 3012437 'cause I don't have<br />another way off this train.
3012461 3013462 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3014505 3016006 No, no, no.
3016090 3017258 Think "perspective."
3017341 3019135 Closer you are, bigger it gets.
3022680 3024348 Okay, come on.
3025599 3026767 In you go.
3141632 3143008 Trinity.
3148347 3149348 No!
3230220 3233182 Welcome back to the real world.
3241732 3242900 Trinity.
3242983 3244169 - What's up, Doc?<br />- His vital systems
3244193 3245653 have been<br />meticulously maintained,
3245736 3247613 but it doesn't look good.
3252952 3255371 - We're losing him.<br />- Cold boot could shock him.
3255955 3256997 Do it.
3270094 3271595 I remember this.
3274264 3275808 The Construct.
3276600 3279228 In between everything
3279311 3281438 and nothing.
3281522 3283190 Welcome to the Crib.
3284775 3286819 I've been chilling here<br />in the ship network...
3290197 3291824 learning all about you.
3296537 3297663 And me.
3301500 3305337 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3305421 3308966 Are memories turned<br />into fiction any less real?
3312136 3315389 Is reality based in memory<br />nothing but fiction?
3315472 3318726 As to my role in all this,<br />my best guess
3318809 3320102 is that you wrote me
3320185 3322229 as an algorithmic reflection<br />of two forces
3322312 3324815 that helped you become you,
3324898 3328360 Morpheus and Agent Smith.
3328444 3329570 A combo pack
3329653 3332156 of counterprogramming<br />that was...
3334950 3338787 Let's just say, more than<br />a little bit crazy-making.
3338871 3341790 But it worked<br />because here we are.
3342833 3344418 Now, for the bad news.
3344501 3346712 Your brain<br />is hooked on this shit
3346795 3349673 the Matrix has been<br />force-feeding you for years.
3349757 3351425 Hooked bad.
3351508 3353028 You're going through<br />major withdrawals.
3353093 3356305 Docbots are giving you<br />crap odds for surviving.
3356388 3358640 But, see,<br />they don't know you like I do.
3361518 3363729 I know exactly what you need.
3385584 3387294 You gotta be kidding.
3387377 3388420 Uh-uh.
3389421 3391215 No joke.
3391298 3395427 Could be this is the first day<br />of the rest of your life.
3395511 3397346 But if you want it...
3400974 3402309 you gotta fight for it.
3403435 3406396 No. I'm done fighting.
3407439 3408440 Are you?
3451775 3453193 What the hell is he doing?
3454361 3457156 Oh, yeah.<br />They taught you good.
3462619 3465873 Made you believe their world<br />was all you deserved.
3465956 3467875 But some part of you knew<br />that was a lie.
3467958 3470711 Some part of you remembered<br />what was real.
3473463 3474631 You don't know me.
3475257 3476300 No?
3482264 3483265 Ooh.
3518967 3520594 I know you, because I know
3520677 3522596 the only thing<br />that still matters to you.
3522679 3525849 I know it's why you're here,<br />why you're still fighting
3525933 3527517 and why you will never give up.
3541698 3543033 Come on, Neo!
3544451 3545661 This is it.
3547788 3549373 This is your last chance.
3557339 3558799 You gotta fight<br />for your goddamn life
3558882 3560217 if you want to see<br />Trinity again.
3565138 3566515 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3569142 3571770 - Holy shit.<br />- Fight for her!
3623822 3625532 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3627451 3628952 Mind if I...
3642132 3643633 How are you doing?
3645177 3647304 If this plug is actually real,
3649264 3651600 that means they took my life...
3654144 3656521 and turned it into a video game.
3659649 3661276 How am I doing?
3662235 3664279 I don't know.
3664363 3666531 I don't even know how to know.
3667657 3669117 That's it, isn't it?
3670619 3672829 If we don't know what's real...
3674915 3676041 we can't resist.
3678960 3680420 They took your story,
3680504 3682005 something that meant
3683090 3685342 so much to people like me,
3686968 3689638 and turned it<br />into something trivial.
3691431 3693225 That's what the Matrix does.
3694059 3696269 It weaponizes every idea.
3697020 3698438 Every dream.
3699940 3701733 Everything<br />that's important to us.
3704194 3706488 Where better to bury truth<br />than inside something
3706571 3709616 as ordinary as a video game?
3709699 3711701 That sounds like the Oracle.
3713120 3714913 Heard so much about her.
3717707 3719251 She was gone before I was free.
3720877 3722295 Gone?
3722379 3725215 When this new version<br />of the Matrix was uploaded,
3726716 3728260 there was a purge.
3733140 3736893 They promised peace<br />and they gave us purge.
3738353 3739813 No.
3739896 3741606 No, there was peace.
3743024 3748155 You made it possible,<br />and it changed everything.
3748238 3751741 Doesn't feel like<br />it changed anything.
3751825 3755036 The Matrix is the same or worse.
3755120 3757330 And I'm back where I started.
3760083 3762544 It feels like everything I did,
3763587 3765088 everything we did...
3771094 3773305 like none of it mattered.
3775515 3777184 All of it mattered.
3778935 3780437 I can show you.
3791114 3792699 This is my crew.
3795827 3797996 Our operator, Seq.
3800207 3804085 Sequoia. But everybody<br />calls me Seq.
3804169 3805629 Nice to meet you.
3806671 3808715 Dad loved redwoods.
3808798 3810050 When he escaped the Matrix
3810133 3811676 and found out<br />they no longer existed,
3811760 3813261 it almost killed him.
3813345 3814554 Lucky, he met Mom
3815430 3817057 and here I am.
3817140 3820852 This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.
3821603 3822729 Hi.
3822812 3825398 You knew my grandfather,<br />Captain Roland.
3825482 3827943 Roland was your grandfather?
3828735 3829819 He always laughed,
3829903 3831303 joking how he never<br />believed in you.
3831988 3833406 But, in private, he said that
3833490 3835617 you freed his mind<br />a second time.
3835700 3837744 Uh, not to fanboy out here,
3837827 3839829 but this is kind<br />of a huge moment for me.
3839913 3842415 Berg is our resident<br />Neo-ologist.
3842499 3843708 A what?
3843792 3846836 There's a lot of people<br />out there like me
3846920 3849256 who are a little bit<br />obsessed with your life.
3849339 3850507 I would never have recognized
3850590 3851776 your Modal<br />if it weren't for him.
3851800 3853110 Whenever<br />you're feeling up for it,
3853134 3855095 I've got, like,<br />a million questions.
3855178 3857639 Me too. Starting with them.
3858974 3860016 It's okay.
3860767 3862018 Come meet him.
3862102 3863395 This is Cybebe.
3863478 3864896 That's Octacles.
3864980 3867649 That's Lumin8.
3867732 3869985 Machines are on our side now?
3870068 3871278 They are synthients.
3871361 3873029 It's a word<br />they prefer to "Machines."
3873113 3874507 Your contact<br />with the Synthient City
3874531 3876908 had a huge impact<br />on their world.
3876992 3878118 That's what I meant.
3878201 3879452 What you changed
3879536 3881216 that nobody believed<br />could ever be changed.
3883039 3885542 The meaning of "our side."
3889337 3891172 Cybebe and Octacles<br />risked their lives
3891256 3892424 to help get you out.
3893883 3894884 Thank you.
3896428 3897470 But why?
3897554 3900098 Not all seek to control.
3900181 3902183 Just as not all wish to be free.
3903977 3905228 What is that?
3905312 3907606 An exomorphic-particle codex.<br />It's pretty new.
3907689 3909816 It gives programs<br />access to this world.
3909899 3911109 Within limits.
3911192 3914195 Limits are the domain<br />of the limited.
3914279 3915822 Morpheus.
3915905 3916948 Thank you.
3917032 3918450 It was my honor.
3920243 3921494 Wow.
3921578 3922746 How does it work?
3922829 3924331 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3924414 3925582 If you want,
3925665 3926976 I can download<br />the codex manual for you.
3927000 3929419 - Sure.<br />- Downloading used to be fun.
3929502 3931880 Now it's all manuals<br />and diagnostics.
3931963 3933673 Can I ask them something?
3936593 3939846 When you unplugged me,<br />there was another pod?
3941181 3944059 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3945268 3946603 It could be Trinity.
3947437 3949022 It's her.
3949105 3952192 I figured we were going<br />to have this conversation.
3952275 3955195 Look, you were not<br />a typical flush-and-grab.
3955278 3956946 You were in this weird tower<br />that Cybebe
3957030 3959115 had never accessed,<br />and she's now exiled.
3959199 3961576 We burned our one shot for you.
3961660 3963703 Even if it were Trinity<br />and she wanted to be free,
3963787 3965830 we have no idea how to do it.
3965914 3966915 Yet.
3969334 3972212 Nobody believed<br />we'd ever find him,
3972295 3973338 but we did.
3975757 3977676 Okay.
3977759 3980887 We don't know<br />how to get her out... yet.
3982931 3985600 Captain, we're approaching<br />security clearance.
3986893 3988061 We're here.
3988144 3989187 Zion?
3997278 3998738 Have a seat.
3998822 4001574 This is Hanno.<br />Best pilot in our fleet.
4001658 4002658 Quite a few synthients
4002701 4004160 deserve that title before me.
4004244 4005412 Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared</i>
4005495 4006871 <i>for landing. Welcome home.</i>
4006955 4008623 Thank you, Control.
4008707 4010291 Um, we're about to crash.
4017215 4018466 General realized we were
4018550 4020593 never going to beat<br />the Sentinels, so...
4020677 4022804 we just got better<br />at hiding from them.
4027392 4028977 Welcome to Io.
4030603 4032021 Io.
4038445 4041197 Wow. That looks real.
4041698 4043283 Bio-sky.
4046870 4049205 Works kind of like grow lights.
4049289 4050957 It's way more complex than that.
4051040 4053501 It pulls water from the crust,<br />hydronating the air.
4053585 4056921 It balances the ECO<br />and our SRI cycles.
4058006 4059340 Plus...
4060175 4061968 it is pretty to look at.
4062051 4063845 As opposed to that.
4065138 4067724 I guess the general sent us<br />a welcome party.
4085992 4087410 God damn.
4088495 4089704 It is you.
4090580 4091748 Niobe?
4093583 4097170 A few more wrinkles<br />and a few less teeth,
4097253 4100924 but wise enough to know<br />I don't know anything.
4101007 4103676 I sure as shit<br />never saw this coming.
4104511 4105678 Neither did I.
4105762 4107096 I told you he was alive.
4107180 4109140 Captain, you and your crew<br />have been grounded.
4109224 4110850 General,<br />if you'd just let me explain.
4110934 4113561 The protocols are put in place<br />for everyone's protection.
4113645 4115522 I'm sorry.<br />I saw an opportunity
4115605 4117065 and I was afraid we'd lose him.
4117148 4119818 But, General, people have been<br />waiting for so long.
4121486 4122737 We found The One.
4124572 4126282 I don't believe in The One.
4128535 4129661 I never did.
4130328 4131412 No?
4132497 4134040 Me neither.
4134123 4136501 But there was a time
4136584 4139254 when you trusted me<br />with your ship,
4139337 4141130 against the Council's orders.
4141214 4143299 The world was different then.
4145134 4146761 We were different.
4148805 4150223 Report to the docks.
4150306 4152016 Scrub down the <i>Mnemosyne.</i>
4152100 4154394 Transfer your access codes.
4154477 4155895 You are done, Captain.
4165572 4167407 We need to talk.
4172620 4175290 When word first came
4175373 4177625 that it actually might be you...
4181379 4185174 I didn't know how I would feel<br />in this moment.
4193057 4195018 It is nice to see you.
4195101 4197812 It's good to see you too.
4203693 4206446 A long way<br />from Dozer's paint stripper.
4206529 4209490 Yes.
4209574 4211326 A lot has changed.
4212869 4214787 Except maybe you.
4217582 4219125 You remember this?
4226215 4228968 It's so easy to forget<br />how much noise
4229052 4230970 the Matrix pumps into your head
4231054 4232847 until you unplug.
4234307 4235683 Yeah.
4235767 4238686 Something else<br />makes the same kind of noise.
4238770 4240980 Takes over every damn thing,
4241064 4242774 just like the Matrix.
4244442 4245443 War.
4247153 4249781 I stood at the barricade<br />of the Temple.
4251574 4253868 Staring<br />at the army of Sentinels,
4254994 4257622 waiting for them<br />to kill every one of us.
4259082 4262168 But then, they left.
4263378 4265838 They said you saved us.
4265922 4267090 I didn't believe it.
4267173 4270510 Every night I would dream<br />of attack sirens.
4271177 4272428 But then,
4275014 4277225 I would wake up to this...
4281229 4282689 silence.
4286150 4287694 I'm ashamed of it now.
4287777 4291781 My pessimism of how long<br />it took me to believe
4291864 4295118 a world without war<br />was possible.
4296536 4298538 You gave me that.
4298621 4301499 You gave that gift to us all.
4301582 4305253 And it is the gift<br />that continues to bear fruit.
4307964 4309716 Come help me get up.
4309799 4311551 Let's take a walk.
4335658 4337660 Oh! Beautiful.
4338745 4341706 This is Freya, head of botany.
4341789 4345084 And this is Quillion,<br />our lead digitologist.
4345168 4349172 I presume our guest<br />needs no introduction.
4349255 4351924 Nothing travels<br />faster than light,
4352008 4353259 except gossip.
4355636 4357055 Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
4359098 4360266 A strawberry?
4360349 4362060 Using digital code<br />from the Matrix,
4362143 4364562 we retro-convert it<br />into DNA sequences.
4364645 4366064 And they grow here?
4366147 4367774 It's not easy<br />augmenting the genome
4367857 4370401 to photosynthesize<br />Bio-sky, but...
4370485 4372236 We're getting there.
4372987 4374697 Go ahead. Try it.
4382205 4384415 We're quite excited<br />about the blueberries.
4384499 4386417 You remember that shit<br />we used to eat?
4386501 4388878 That slop that tasted like rust.
4390463 4394092 Zion could have never<br />made something like this.
4394175 4395802 Why?
4395885 4398471 Because we needed synthients
4398554 4400515 and DI like him.
4400598 4403976 Zion was stuck in the past.<br />Stuck in war.
4404060 4406437 Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
4406521 4410399 They believed<br />that it had to be us or them.
4410483 4413486 This city was built by us
4413569 4415238 and them.
4420910 4422453 What happened to Zion?
4422537 4425957 I've been waiting<br />for you to ask that question.
4427917 4431379 All of the troubles<br />started in the Machine Cities.
4431462 4435174 Power plants were unable<br />to produce enough energy.
4435258 4439011 Nothing can breed violence<br />like scarcity.
4440763 4442348 For the first time,
4442431 4445643 <i>we saw machines at war<br />with one other.</i>
4448646 4452650 We got word from the Oracle<br />of a new power rising.
4454610 4457280 That was the last<br />we heard from her.
4460950 4462326 Morpheus.
4462410 4466789 After the siege,<br />he was elected unanimously.
4466873 4469750 High Chair of the Council.
4469834 4473254 Oh, how he loved that.
4473337 4477550 But as rumors<br />of this new power spread,
4477633 4479051 he ignored them.
4479135 4483764 He was certain what you had<br />done could not be undone.
4483848 4487810 All of these people never<br />stopped believing in miracles,
4487894 4490271 believing in you.
4502325 4503701 I'm sorry.
4505536 4507955 How could I know<br />this would happen?
4508039 4510333 We didn't understand<br />all of it back then.
4510416 4512251 No more than we do now.
4512335 4515630 I didn't come here<br />to cause you problems, Niobe,
4516672 4518424 but I need your help.
4520092 4521552 Trinity is alive.
4521636 4523387 Then there is another question.
4523471 4525264 Why did they keep her alive?
4525348 4526599 I can't answer that.
4526682 4530019 But if there's a chance<br />I can free her,
4530102 4531646 I have to try.
4531729 4535650 Even if it means endangering<br />everyone in this city?
4539904 4541614 I'm sorry, Neo.
4541697 4545368 I won't let what happened<br />to Zion happen to Io.
4547161 4548537 I hope you'll forgive<br />an old woman
4548621 4551707 for asking you to go<br />with Sheperd, here,
4551791 4553292 till we have<br />better understanding
4553376 4554794 of what's going on.
4554877 4557922 You're going to imprison me<br />after I just got free?
4558005 4561801 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4561884 4564679 but neither does growing old.
4564762 4566889 But you don't<br />hear me complaining.
4578901 4580736 Sorry.
4580820 4582863 I've never met a legend before.
4586242 4587326 Neo.
4588619 4590371 Sheperd.
4591747 4593582 Crazy. You're real.
4595543 4596669 "Real."
4597753 4599755 There's that word again.
4605261 4607638 People talk a lot<br />about the old days.
4607722 4609974 About you, the viral Agent.
4610057 4612685 The siege of Zion.
4612768 4614770 Everything was simpler<br />back then.
4615771 4617356 People wanted to be free.
4619442 4621360 It's different now.
4621444 4624905 Sometimes it feels like<br />people gave up.
4626157 4627867 Like the Matrix won.
4630661 4632079 This is you.
4636083 4638377 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4640421 4642131 Is it true you could fly?
4646969 4647970 Cool.
4678501 4679794 Morpheus.
4679877 4682797 Oh. General stuck you<br />in the Rapunzel tower.
4685257 4686759 On the upside, it's a nice view.
4686842 4688928 What happened to Bugs<br />and the others?
4689011 4690781 They're supposed to be<br />sterilizing the <i>Mnemosyne</i>
4690805 4692932 - with a toothbrush.<br />- "Supposed to be"?
4693015 4694409 Well, I could tell you<br />that they're standing by,
4694433 4695744 waiting for you<br />to make the choice
4695768 4697603 to remain meekly incarcerated
4697687 4700022 or bust the hell out of here<br />and go and find Trinity.
4701607 4702692 But that ain't a choice.
4715329 4717456 General, what should we do?
4720876 4723462 Bugs has the same<br />independence of mind
4723546 4725005 she had the day you freed her.
4725089 4728092 This is not<br />independence of mind.
4728175 4729218 It's mutiny.
4730553 4731804 Come on, 'Be.
4731887 4734890 I know how much<br />you hated locking him up.
4734974 4737685 Just like I know<br />there's a part of you
4737768 4740813 that's relieved now<br />that he's gone.
4742273 4746110 We've worked so hard<br />to keep Io safe.
4748863 4750489 This scares me.
4761041 4762334 That's her.
4762418 4763544 On the bridge.
4764086 4765087 Got her.
4773763 4776015 It's sick<br />how the Semblance works.
4776098 4778851 You see flashes<br />of the real her, but...
4778934 4780561 the way she reads...
4782271 4784899 Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.
4786775 4789862 This is a tough question, Neo,<br />but it has to be asked.
4790988 4793157 What if she's happy<br />where she is?
4794617 4795868 How did I read?
4797953 4799872 Exactly like her.
4803626 4805878 Take us to broadcast depth.
4817181 4818641 Thank you for helping me.
4820267 4822269 Most of us are here<br />because of you.
4824939 4826065 I also admit our only chance
4826148 4827566 to get out<br />of the general's doghouse
4827650 4829276 is for you to find your mojo.
4830986 4833572 What if I can't be<br />what I once was?
4835115 4836742 Then we're all fucked.
4836825 4838202 Two minutes.
4838285 4839662 Two minutes to broadcast.
4848837 4850317 I slipped you in<br />through a hotel room.
4852007 4853467 Should be safe.
4864270 4865771 Portal's open.
4865854 4868041 Closest I could get you is<br />the warehouse near her garage.
4868065 4869608 Whole zone's crawling with bots.
4870985 4872528 Let's go.
4899763 4902891 So, what do you think of him?
4902975 4905769 I was kinda worried at first<br />because he's so much older.
4905853 4908355 The beard, the hair... Oh.
4908439 4911859 - No, totally works for me.<br />- You idiot.
4911942 4913319 I mean "The One" thing.
4914987 4917948 You know, everyone that<br />shipped with him died.
4918032 4920826 Oh, yeah. He's gonna<br />get us all killed, for sure.
4926206 4927750 Predictable as ever.
4930002 4931754 Smith.
4931837 4934173 Smith? As in, "the" Smith?
4942306 4943599 This is so insane.
4943682 4944993 There's so many theories<br />about the two of them
4945017 4946685 and they're standing<br />right there.
4946769 4948354 This code is freaky!
4948437 4951315 He's like an Agent, but not.
4955486 4957071 An appeal to reason.
4961283 4962785 How did you find us?
4962868 4965788 You never appreciated<br />our relationship.
4965871 4967247 Not like The Analyst.
4967331 4969249 - The what?<br />- My doctor.
4969333 4973045 He used our bond<br />and turned it into a chain.
4973128 4974797 It's so obvious<br />once you see it, right?
4974880 4978300 But this whole altered-code<br />update really blew my mind.
4978384 4980386 I still don't know<br />how he did it.
4980469 4983263 You, as a balding nerd.
4983347 4985099 Hilarious.
4985182 4987559 And me...
4987643 4990312 even more perfect.
4990396 4992398 Maybe a little too far<br />on the piercing blue eyes.
4992481 4994400 What do you think?
4994483 4996443 What do you want, Smith?
4998612 5000906 I have such dreams, Tom.
5000989 5002700 Big dreams.
5002783 5005536 Well, mostly just extremely<br />violent revenge fantasies,
5005619 5007037 but in order for me<br />to pursue mine,
5007121 5009164 I need to dissuade you<br />from pursuing yours.
5009248 5012876 Hmm. Sounds like conflict.
5014586 5016130 Inevitable?
5017339 5018674 Doesn't have to be.
5018757 5020926 All you have to do<br />is stay out of the Matrix,
5021009 5022511 and leave the good doctor to me.
5022594 5024930 You can have him.<br />I'm here for Trinity.
5025013 5026515 That's the trouble, Tom.
5026598 5029268 He knew you'd come,<br />just like I did.
5031019 5032229 Trust me.
5033188 5034732 You're not ready for him.
5034815 5037609 Captain, I'm reading portals<br />from the lower frequencies.
5042906 5046076 I won't have his leash<br />on my neck again.
5053542 5055794 I found some<br />old acquaintances of yours.
5056837 5060215 Bugs!
5073896 5074938 Exiles.
5075022 5076249 I thought they were all purged.
5076273 5077775 You?
5077858 5078984 Oh!
5079067 5081403 It is you!
5082738 5086325 All these years.<br />I can't believe it.
5086992 5088660 Oh, God.
5088744 5092706 You stole my life!
5097461 5099004 What the Merv is trying to say,
5099087 5101548 is that their situation<br />is a little bit like mine.
5101632 5103842 To have their lives back,<br />yours has to end.
5107513 5108597 Kill him!
5121819 5124279 You ruined
5124363 5127491 every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5127574 5130160 We had grace.
5135207 5136750 We had style!
5136834 5138836 We had conversation!
5138919 5140879 Not this...
5165404 5168949 Art, films,<br />books were all better!
5169032 5172244 Originality mattered!
5172327 5174246 You gave us Face-Zucker-suck
5174329 5177791 and Cock-me-climatey-<br />Wiki-piss-and-shit!
5223921 5225505 I still know kung fu.
5227382 5228383 Neo!
5258080 5259581 Just like old times.
5317222 5318265 Neo.
5320183 5322853 I've been thinking<br />about us, Tom.
5322936 5326231 Look how binary is the form,<br />the nature of things.
5327482 5328775 Ones and zeros.
5329985 5331111 Light and dark.
5333238 5335282 Choice and its absence.
5338660 5340912 Anderson and Smith.
5377532 5379743 You've lost something, Tom.
5383705 5385540 You're not what you used to be.
5386792 5387876 It's true.
5401223 5403225 - Nice one.<br />- Thanks.
5411066 5412275 Come on, Neo.
5437259 5439803 Captain. You okay?
5439886 5442848 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5442931 5444057 Smith is killing him.
5444141 5445517 Where?
5453024 5455026 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5457612 5459739 After all, you are the one<br />who set me free...
5461032 5462033 again.
5464077 5465162 So, you, more than anyone,
5465245 5466872 understands why I can't go back.
5469457 5471251 You should have listened to me.
5473461 5475213 Now you'll never see her again.
5488810 5489978 What was that?
5490061 5491438 That was Neo.
5493064 5494065 Mojo rising.
5502115 5503575 You all right?
5503658 5505160 Yeah.
5505243 5506443 It's gonna trigger a response.
5506495 5507704 I got multiple exits ready.
5507787 5509247 This is not over yet!
5509331 5512042 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5519090 5520508 We should go.
5520592 5521760 I can't.
5521843 5523762 I have to talk to her.
5523845 5526097 Neo, those Exiles<br />were older than you,
5526181 5527265 and we barely handled them.
5530852 5532395 You really wanna do this now?
5537817 5539027 I mean...
5543031 5544616 you look like shit.
5555877 5558421 Oh, my God. What?<br />What happened?
5558505 5559631 An accident.
5559714 5562050 Kush! Call a doctor.
5562133 5563677 It's fine.
5564594 5566721 I don't have a lot of time.
5566805 5568515 I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5568598 5571184 After we spoke, I realized...
5572060 5574104 my life wasn't a life.
5575563 5578316 At some point, I think I gave up
5578400 5580652 searching for something real.
5586992 5588285 Wait.
5589744 5592330 Something happened.
5592414 5594791 I looked for you<br />at the coffee shop.
5596584 5598920 I began to wonder<br />if I imagined you.
5600088 5602632 And then last night<br />I had a dream.
5602716 5605510 In the dream, you were<br />surrounded by police,
5605593 5608138 then they started chasing us.
5608221 5611224 - Us?<br />- You were on my bike with me.
5613393 5614769 How did it end?
5616187 5617355 Not good.
5619899 5623320 I've had dreams<br />that weren't just dreams.
5623403 5625655 You mean a dream that came true?
5633330 5635957 Finally, we can talk<br />like adults.
5637625 5640754 I hate lying. I do.<br />It exhausts me.
5642547 5644632 Tiff and I have been<br />waiting for you...
5644716 5645967 like, forever.
5653058 5654351 Deja vu, right?
5656144 5658313 Oh, no use.<br />You can't beat time.
5658396 5662108 This rewind is happening<br />faster than you can blink.
5666988 5668990 You gave me the idea.
5671826 5675121 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
5678166 5679292 "Bullet time."
5681127 5683088 I know. Kind of ironic,
5683171 5687092 using the power that defined<br />you to control you.
5687175 5689803 I kept such a close eye on you
5689886 5692430 and still you found a way out.
5692514 5694891 Clever monkey, using that Modal.
5695850 5697018 Call me an optimist,
5697102 5699270 but this could<br />all be for the best.
5699354 5702190 The skin's not looking<br />too bad this time.
5702273 5704901 I know some of this will be<br />difficult for you to hear,
5704984 5706444 after everything<br />you went through.
5706528 5707904 All that pain and suffering,
5707987 5710824 only to learn the world<br />doesn't end when you do.
5712367 5713451 Surprise.
5719457 5720875 I was there when you died.
5723378 5724504 I said to myself,
5724587 5727799 "Here is the anomaly<br />of anomalies."
5727882 5730677 What an extraordinary<br />opportunity.
5732345 5733805 First, I had to convince<br />the Suits
5733888 5735306 to let me rebuild<br />the two of you.
5735390 5736975 Why her? Getting there.
5737058 5738852 And don't worry,<br />she can't hear me.
5738935 5742063 Resurrecting you both<br />was crazy expensive.
5742147 5743481 Like renovating a house.
5743565 5745817 Took twice as long,<br />cost twice as much.
5749904 5752365 I thought you'd be happy<br />to be alive again.
5753408 5754659 So wrong.
5756453 5760081 Did you know hope and despair<br />are nearly identical in code?
5762083 5764043 We worked for years,
5764127 5765754 <i>trying to activate<br />your source code.</i>
5765837 5769257 I was about to give up,<br />when I realized...
5772343 5773386 Trinity.
5773470 5775638 It was never just you.
5775722 5778808 Alone, neither of you<br />is of any particular value.
5780518 5781686 Like acids and bases,
5781769 5784147 you're dangerous<br />when mixed together.
5784230 5787192 Every sim<br />where you two bonded...
5787275 5789360 Let's just say<br />bad things happened.
5791404 5792864 Neo!
5797118 5800497 However, as long as I managed<br />to keep you close,
5800580 5802248 but not too close,
5802332 5805543 I discovered<br />something incredible.
5805627 5809130 Now, my predecessor<br />loved precision.
5809214 5812884 His Matrix was all fussy facts<br />and equations.
5812967 5814719 He hated the human mind.
5814802 5816221 So he never bothered to realize
5816304 5817531 that you don't give a shit<br />about facts.
5817555 5818973 It's all about fiction.
5819057 5823728 The only world that matters<br />is the one in here.
5823812 5826814 And you people<br />believe the craziest shit.
5827357 5828608 Why?
5828691 5831277 What validates<br />and makes your fictions real?
5832237 5833321 Feelings.
5834489 5835949 Allow me.
5837325 5838993 Kush, here,<br />is one of my handlers.
5839077 5840411 They're everywhere.
5840495 5843081 Such a pain, cloning Agents<br />over a coppertop.
5843164 5845625 Far more effective<br />just to saturate a population.
5847544 5850421 And, bonus,<br />swarm mode is sick fun.
5862850 5865979 Ooh! Nicely done.
5867438 5870692 You ever wonder<br />why you have nightmares?
5870775 5873736 Why your own brain tortures you?
5873820 5877323 It's actually us,<br />maximizing your output.
5877407 5878575 It works just like this.
5878658 5881286 Oh, no!<br />Can you stop the bullet?
5881369 5884289 If only you could move faster.
5884372 5886916 Here's the thing about feelings.
5887000 5889294 They're so much easier<br />to control than facts.
5890253 5892130 Turns out, in my Matrix,
5892213 5895675 the worse we treat you,<br />the more we manipulate you,
5895758 5898219 the more energy you produce.
5898303 5900513 It's nuts.
5900597 5902181 I've been setting<br />productivity records
5902265 5903558 every year since I took over.
5903641 5906477 And, the best part,<br />zero resistance.
5906561 5907937 People stay in their pods,
5908021 5911107 happier than pigs in shit.
5911190 5912400 The key to it all?
5912483 5913818 You.
5913901 5915069 And her.
5915153 5917363 Quietly yearning<br />for what you don't have,
5917447 5919866 while dreading<br />losing what you do.
5919949 5921618 For 99.9% of your race,
5921701 5924370 that is the definition<br />of reality.
5924454 5927332 Desire and fear, baby.
5927415 5930376 Just give the people<br />what they want, right?
5939677 5942722 She's the only home<br />you have, Thomas.
5942805 5946100 Come home before<br />something terrible happens.
5956527 5957820 - Bugs!<br />- I hear him.
5964202 5965370 Trinity!
5965453 5967163 - You shouldn't call me that.<br />- I'm sorry.
5968665 5969916 I have to go.
5969999 5971167 But I'll be back.
5972293 5974587 Neo! Time to go.
5977090 5978800 - Sentinels?<br />- Worse.
5980259 5981344 <i>General ordered me</i>
5981427 5982428 <i>to look after the ship.</i>
5982512 5984389 So you shadowed us?
5984472 5986057 Check your long-range scans.
5986140 5988142 <i>Squids are combing this area.</i>
5988226 5989686 He's right.
5989769 5990937 You can stay here and die,
5991020 5993398 or come back<br />and face a court-martial.
5993481 5995483 And you call that a choice?
6002699 6004826 Sheperd should have<br />left you to the Squids.
6004909 6008287 I'm too damn old to sit<br />through some boring-ass trial.
6008371 6009580 Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
6009664 6011582 Do shut your mouth.
6011666 6013960 Do address me as General.
6014043 6018297 And do not rob<br />my ex-captain of her agency,
6018381 6020383 which she exercised with her own
6020466 6023970 particular brand<br />of shortsighted stupidity.
6025221 6026305 Shortsighted?
6027974 6031936 You care more about growing<br />fruit than freeing minds.
6032019 6034522 We are not going<br />to have this argument again.
6034605 6036941 It's not an argument.<br />It's a fact.
6037024 6038234 You gave up on people.
6039694 6042029 I tell you<br />what I'm going to give up on
6042113 6043197 and it's you!
6045616 6047535 Sheperd, get her<br />out of my sight!
6047618 6048745 General...
6050663 6051748 Disarm!
6051831 6053458 Kujaku's a friend.
6060006 6061632 Hello, friend.
6064218 6065219 Okay.
6066554 6067764 Him?
6074687 6076355 General.
6076439 6077732 Thank you for seeing me.
6077815 6079609 I figured if there was anyone
6079692 6081986 who could make sense<br />of this mess,
6082069 6083863 it would be you.
6083946 6085072 Hello, Neo.
6085156 6086991 I know you.
6087074 6089076 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6092413 6093664 Why?
6093748 6095500 We met a long time ago.
6097210 6098294 Good morning.
6101088 6102089 Sati.
6102173 6104675 My father knew we'd meet again,
6104759 6107720 though he would have wished<br />for happier circumstances.
6107804 6109597 His inadvertent role<br />in what happened to you
6109680 6111933 was the greatest regret<br />of his life.
6112016 6113893 I don't understand.
6115269 6116938 My father was the chief engineer
6117021 6118272 at the Anomaleum.
6118356 6119732 The what?
6119816 6122902 My father designed<br />the resurrection pods
6122985 6124904 where Neo and Trinity<br />were imprisoned.
6126948 6128199 I'm sorry.
6128282 6129784 You knew what happened to him?
6129867 6133079 You knew that he and Trinity<br />both were alive...
6134080 6135373 and you didn't tell me?
6135456 6138376 There were times<br />I doubted my decision, Niobe.
6138459 6140086 But Io needed you.
6140169 6141504 This city needed to be built
6141587 6143631 for your people as well as mine.
6144799 6146551 If I would have<br />told you everything,
6146634 6148803 you would have had a very<br />difficult choice to make.
6148886 6150471 My friends
6151806 6154308 let me make my own choices.
6154392 6156310 If it was a mistake,
6156394 6158479 you have my deepest apologies.
6160565 6161899 Why are you here now?
6161983 6164485 Neo's escape has<br />destabilized the Matrix.
6164569 6165820 The Anomaleum draws its current
6165903 6167238 from Trinity alone now.
6167321 6169490 A fail-safe has been<br />triggered to reset
6169574 6171576 the Matrix back<br />to the previous version.
6171659 6173452 But The Analyst<br />halted the reset.
6173536 6174829 He's convinced the authorities
6174912 6176873 that you will soon<br />return voluntarily.
6177999 6179917 And why would he say that?
6180001 6183087 Because if I don't go back,<br />he'll kill Trinity.
6185840 6188217 Faced with returning to your pod
6188301 6191095 or enduring<br />Trinity's death again.
6191178 6192471 What would you choose, Neo?
6193556 6194849 I'll go back.
6196559 6198769 Well, The Analyst<br />knows you well,
6198853 6201606 but that knowledge<br />has made him incautious.
6201689 6203357 After you escaped,
6203441 6206277 he should have accepted his<br />losses and devacuated Trinity.
6206360 6209238 But that would have prevented<br />this extraordinary opportunity
6209322 6211240 that now exists before us.
6211908 6214827 A few hours ago,
6214911 6218205 no one would have been able<br />to convince me
6218289 6222585 that I would be standing here,<br />trying to explain a mission
6222668 6224629 as crazy as this one.
6228424 6230051 What are you doing?
6230134 6231677 - Volunteering.<br />- Oh, no.
6231761 6236307 You are the one captain<br />that I am ordering to go.
6236390 6237975 Now you don't<br />have to order me, General,
6238059 6239727 'cause I'm volunteering.
6243105 6244649 I need two more.
6249153 6251989 Are you out of your minds?
6252073 6253950 You don't even know what it is.
6254033 6256953 General, we know you.
6257036 6258245 If you say this is important,
6258329 6260373 none of us is<br />choosing to stay home.
6265753 6266837 Thank you.
6271926 6273928 Knuckle up, and good luck.
6303958 6305459 Trinity is held<br />in the Anomaleum,
6305543 6307294 which is in this<br />transmission tower.
6307378 6309630 <i>The passages used<br />to rescue Neo are now sealed</i>
6309714 6311924 <i>and a legion of Sentinels<br />patrols the tower.</i>
6312008 6314051 So, stealth will be paramount.
6314135 6315886 As long as we raise no alarms,
6315970 6318055 this first part of the mission<br />should be the easiest.
6318139 6319449 You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,
6319473 6321225 sneaking across<br />an entire power plant,
6321308 6322727 climbing a two-kilometer tower
6322810 6324645 guarded by thousands<br />of Sentinels?
6324729 6325896 That's the easy part?
6325980 6327648 Exactly so.
6327732 6330067 Because all we have to do<br />is convince someone
6330151 6331819 who does this every day
6331902 6333320 to take one of us along.
6356844 6358679 Fifty meters below the Anomaleum
6358763 6360264 is a stratum<br />of amniotic filters.
6360347 6363768 Hidden along this edge<br />is a small hexagonal vent.
6363851 6367021 <i>This vent feeds the air intake<br />into the corpuscular modifier,</i>
6367104 6370191 <i>which oxygenates<br />the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.</i>
6370858 6372068 I get it.
6372151 6375029 The exomorph slinkies up<br />Neo's old umbilicus.
6376280 6377406 What could go wrong?
6424286 6425663 <i>Once inside,</i>
6425746 6427581 <i>Morpheus will use<br />the System Operator</i>
6427665 6430000 <i>to open the devacuator line<br />and disengage the macerators.</i>
6434088 6435673 In order to unplug<br />Trinity's body,
6435756 6437967 while her mind still remains<br />connected to the Matrix,
6438050 6439677 I'm gonna need<br />a second human brain
6439760 6440970 to implement the bypass.
6441053 6442680 And since Neo<br />must be with The Analyst,
6442763 6445933 the only available mind<br />that's a near-enough match
6446016 6447059 is yours.
6448602 6449602 Figures.
6467037 6468164 Thanks, Cybebe.
6476380 6478382 Does Trinity still have<br />to take the red pill?
6478465 6479884 Since Kujaku and I<br />are transferring
6479967 6481260 her consciousness onto the ship,
6481343 6483012 it's not strictly necessary.
6483095 6487016 But what matters is that<br />this is her choice.
6487099 6490394 Extracting a confused<br />or an uncertain mind will,
6490477 6491854 in all probability, kill her.
6491937 6494481 But even if it is<br />what she wants,
6494565 6498235 won't The Analyst just order<br />the Sentinels to stop you?
6498319 6499820 He will.
6499904 6502364 But if my plan works,<br />it won't matter.
6502448 6503448 Why?
6503490 6505117 Because we'll already be gone.
6506827 6508746 Somebody thinks<br />this hard about a plan,
6508829 6510247 there has to be a reason why.
6512458 6513667 When my father realized
6513751 6516003 how the Anomaleum<br />was going to be used,
6516086 6519548 he covertly transferred<br />the designs to me.
6519632 6522134 The Analyst<br />discovered his betrayal
6522218 6524094 and had my parents purged.
6526722 6529725 I would have been murdered too<br />if it wasn't for Kujaku.
6532770 6536774 Not a day goes by<br />that I don't grieve them.
6536857 6539985 I've been praying for this day<br />for a very long time.
6548077 6549620 We're coming up on broadcast.
6552206 6556210 I thought you should know<br />that I'm here because of her.
6559713 6562091 All I ever wanted was to be<br />as fearless as Trinity.
6564301 6567721 But I saw how she reacted<br />in the garage, and I...
6567805 6570432 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6570516 6572059 What if we're too late?
6573852 6575562 What if she's not<br />Trinity anymore?
6580985 6583737 I never believed I was The One.
6584613 6586031 But she did.
6587074 6588701 She believed in me.
6591370 6593580 It's my turn to believe in her.
6618564 6620482 This is where it gets tricky.
6631618 6634038 Have you ever done<br />an operation like this?
6634747 6635831 Not yet.
6657561 6658896 Here we go.
6676538 6678457 Welcome home.
6678540 6680918 All I want is to talk to her.
6681001 6682628 Do you mean Tiff?
6682711 6685464 Come back, and you can talk<br />to her as often as you like.
6685547 6686924 I mean, handsome Chad
6687007 6688467 may have something<br />to say about it.
6688550 6691845 If she tells me<br />this is what she wants,
6693055 6694223 you win.
6694306 6695432 Really?
6695516 6698268 But if she wants me,
6698352 6700187 then you'll let us go free.
6700270 6703023 And why would I do something<br />as stupid as that?
6703107 6705901 Right now, I'm on a ship full<br />of people who will unplug me
6705984 6708987 before they'll let you<br />take me back.
6709071 6711115 If you want this Matrix,
6711198 6712741 this is your only chance.
6712825 6715786 But how do I know<br />they won't unplug you anyway?
6715869 6719206 Same way I know you'll let us<br />walk out of here.
6744815 6746483 Okay.
6746567 6748068 I like tests.
6748944 6750737 We'll let Tiff decide.
6768088 6769256 That's it.
6770466 6772009 Bypass is ready.
6772092 6773802 Now what?
6773886 6775137 We wait.
6775220 6777181 Doesn't it seem crazy<br />to come all this way
6777264 6778849 and leave her here?
6778932 6781602 We must abide by her decision.
6781685 6783270 And if she says no,
6784104 6785564 what happens to Neo?
6785647 6786857 At this time,
6786940 6789776 the most important choice<br />of Neo's life
6789860 6791361 is not his to make.
6822392 6824186 I saw this in my dream.
6825646 6829107 If I was the Oracle,<br />maybe I could explain it.
6829775 6831360 The Oracle.
6831443 6833111 From your game?
6834988 6837241 It's not a game.
6839368 6840577 Oh, God.
6848043 6851463 After you left, I went home
6851547 6853257 and I played it.
6855634 6858095 I kept thinking,
6858178 6861515 why does this story<br />feel like a memory?
6868689 6870440 There's a part of me
6873026 6876238 that feels like I have been<br />waiting my whole life for you.
6879199 6881451 And that part is like,
6881535 6885247 "What the hell<br />took you so long?"
6885330 6887374 I don't have an easy answer.
6889543 6891712 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6893171 6895048 Afraid of what might happen.
6896550 6899553 Afraid of hurting<br />the only person I ever loved.
6901263 6904808 I wish I was who you think I am.
6906184 6907769 But look at me.
6909062 6911231 I can't be her.
6911315 6913442 - Mom!<br />- Mom! Come on.
6913525 6914776 - Mom!<br />- It's Callie.
6914860 6915861 Is this real?
6915944 6917112 You have to come with us.
6917195 6918572 Come on, we gotta go.
6918655 6920216 Tiff, hey. Don't know<br />what's going on here,
6920240 6921575 but I'm glad we found you.
6921658 6923011 - She got hit by a car!<br />- I know, it's crazy.
6923035 6924161 She was chasing after you.
6924244 6925638 They're casting her arm.<br />We gotta go.
6925662 6927039 Doctor said she's gonna be fine.
6927122 6928915 You have to come<br />with us to the hospital.
6928999 6930083 It's too late.
6930167 6931376 I understand.
6931460 6933295 - Tiff, come on, let's go.<br />- Come on.
6939801 6940886 What's happening?
6942971 6944097 Neo was wrong.
6977464 6978548 Tiffany.
6982135 6984680 Tiffany, you have<br />to come with us.
6986306 6987683 Tiffany!
6989976 6993689 I wish you would<br />fucking stop calling me that.
6993772 6995315 I hate that name.
6996817 6998360 My name is Trinity
6998443 7000821 and you better<br />take your hands off of me.
7011998 7012999 Neo!
7013500 7014501 Trinity!
7015669 7016712 Oh, shit.
7018004 7019339 Get her out. Get her out!
7027973 7031268 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7031351 7034020 I own that mistake.<br />Shouldn't have pressed.
7034104 7037107 Women used to be<br />so easy to control.
7037190 7041737 You know there's no way<br />I can let you two go free.
7045157 7046616 Cannot happen.
7049786 7052622 So, I guess it's deja vu<br />all over again.
7053749 7055542 She dies
7055625 7057002 and it's all your fault.
7058545 7061131 Lies, lies and more lies.
7061882 7063091 Smith?
7063175 7064301 What has the world come to
7064384 7065611 when you can't even<br />trust a program?
7065635 7068972 How...
7069055 7071808 Tom and I have more in common<br />than you know.
7071892 7074936 Once he got out, let's just say,
7075771 7077564 I was free to be me.
7085238 7087991 - Yeah!<br />- Trinity?
7136373 7137541 You ready?
7137624 7138917 Yeah.
7181001 7182460 Oh, no.
7183837 7186214 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7203189 7204190 No.
7210030 7211531 Stop them.
7237182 7238683 You think this is over?
7238767 7240769 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7249736 7252072 Here, our unexpected<br />alliance ends.
7253740 7256368 You know the difference<br />between us, Tom?
7256451 7258328 Anyone could have been you.
7258411 7260455 Whereas I've always been anyone.
7265835 7267337 What just happened?
7267420 7268588 What?
7270590 7273176 Oh, no! Move! Move!
7273259 7274302 Get the hell out of there!
7278181 7280141 - How bad?<br />- Like, all the bad.
7281434 7282894 Yeah, this is bad.
7284270 7285897 I don't suppose<br />you can still fly?
7296282 7297993 Yeah, that's not happening.
7323727 7324978 Neo! Get on.
7333653 7335447 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7335530 7337574 Everyone else,<br />we stay with them!
7354632 7357177 - How is she?<br />- Life signs are good.
7361014 7362474 Her signal's strong, Captain.
7371357 7373401 Well done, Captain.
7375779 7377655 All we need is a miracle.
7405725 7406768 I hate bots.
7413066 7414901 - Get us out of here!<br />- I'm trying!
7414984 7416986 The lockdown is tracking.<br />Swarm is everywhere.
7417070 7418270 Never seen anything like this.
7464117 7466286 Seq, what is that?
7471291 7472417 What's wrong?
7474127 7475628 What are you...
7483178 7485221 He's turning bots into bombs.
7517670 7518880 Shit!
7518963 7519964 Lexy?
7534354 7535563 Sheperd's in trouble.
7538650 7540443 Jack me in.
7540526 7542570 I can get you in.<br />I don't know if I can get you out.
7548534 7550245 No!
7563591 7564717 What are they doing?
7568763 7570431 Herding them into a kill zone.
7603506 7604841 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7604924 7607176 Hang on, Lex.
7611389 7613224 Lexy!
7655475 7656642 There they are!
7683086 7684253 Morpheus!
7688132 7689842 Lex.
7689926 7691803 - Bugsy.<br />- Hell yeah!
7692762 7694389 Seq, where's Neo?
7694472 7696099 It's bad. They're pinned.
7696182 7697266 Heading to a roof.
7766544 7767795 Nodal fibrillation is critical.
7767879 7769297 She'll die if we don't extract.
7810296 7812924 It's so beautiful.
7828231 7829941 I remember this.
7832026 7834237 I remember us.
7852338 7854340 My dream ended here.
7865226 7866811 We can't go back.
7868938 7870022 We won't.
7889292 7890668 Can they make the jump?
7921741 7923367 I'm not doing this.
7923451 7924827 Are you doing this?
7948934 7950019 Bye.
8031058 8032643 How dramatic.
8033477 8034770 "Tiffany"?
8034854 8037815 It was a private joke.
8037898 8039442 An amusement, that's all.
8039525 8041861 An amusement? Hmm.
8043612 8045781 Whoa.
8045865 8047283 Kind of like that?
8051397 8053900 Okay. Ow.
8054373 8055833 If you hated the name so much,
8055916 8058085 why did you heel like<br />a good little bitch so long?
8061213 8063466 Yeah. Definitely asked<br />for that.
8068763 8070723 Can't you control her?
8076456 8078166 That was for using children.
8083046 8084547 We have a few questions.
8084631 8086320 You tried to activate<br />the fail-safe.
8086409 8087884 The Suits tried.
8087967 8090261 Obviously, without control<br />of your source code,
8090345 8091861 I knew that was impossible.
8091970 8094015 So, why haven't<br />the Suits purged you?
8094891 8096630 Because I know the system.
8097559 8099283 I know human beings.
8100096 8102280 And I know you.
8104884 8107278 Right now, you're feeling good<br />about what you've done.
8107362 8109781 You should.<br />It was a victory. Bravo.
8110545 8111950 Now what?
8112033 8114691 You've come here to negotiate<br />some kind of deal?
8114790 8116369 You think you hold<br />all the cards,
8116463 8118862 because you can do whatever<br />you want in this world.
8118960 8121261 I say, go for it.
8121374 8123920 Remake it.<br />Knock yourselves out.
8124003 8126047 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8126131 8127298 But here's the thing.
8127382 8130352 The sheeple aren't<br />going anywhere.
8130440 8131850 They like my world.
8132003 8134753 They don't want this sentimentality.
8134846 8136770 They don't want freedom<br />or empowerment.
8136858 8139227 They want to be controlled.
8139350 8141351 They crave<br />the comfort of certainty.
8141440 8144180 And that means you two,<br />back in your pods,
8144280 8147736 unconscious and alone,<br />just like them.
8152060 8154704 We're not here<br />to negotiate anything.
8154794 8157036 We were on our way<br />to remake your world.
8157120 8158553 Change a few things.
8158650 8161051 I kind of like the "paint the sky<br />with rainbows" idea.
8161150 8163330 Just remind people<br />what a free mind can do.
8163420 8164961 I forgot. It's easy to forget.
8165044 8167464 - He makes it easy.<br />- That, he does.
8167647 8169538 Something he should think about.
8170759 8171968 Before we got started,
8172051 8174358 we decided to stop by<br />to say thank you.
8175111 8178057 You gave us something<br />we never thought we could have.
8178141 8179517 And what is that?
8180353 8181903 Another chance.
8845589 8848227 Face reality, people.<br />Movies are dead.
8848310 8849929 Games are dead.
8850182 8851182 Narrative?
8851279 8852181 Dead.
8852241 8854271 Media is nothing<br />but neuro-trigger response
8854351 8855351 and viral conditioning.
8855445 8856986 Wait, what are you two<br />talking about?
8859258 8860433 Cat videos.
8861222 8864874 What we need is<br />a series of videos
8864994 8867324 that we call "The Catrix."
