58225 59851 - Seq, I'm in.<br />- Captain.
60018 62187 You were right.<br />The skylight was a window pane.
62271 63480 I've got serious interference.
63647 65691 Weird. It's some kind of Modal.
65857 67651 Looks like old code.
67818 69111 It feels really familiar.
69278 70696 Drop a pin.<br />I'll signal for backup.
70862 72114 - I'm gonna check it out.<br />- Bugs?
72281 73740 If the general finds out<br />we've been fishing...
73907 75701 A quick peek can't hurt.
75867 77035 Did you hear that?
77202 78537 Shit. I think our signal was traced.
78704 80622 Bugs, this feels like a trap.
80789 81957 Bugs!
122039 124333 Freeze! Do not move!
124499 125500 We will shoot!
125626 128920 Very slowly, raise your hands.
142726 144269 Here we go.
150192 151360 Hey, where are you going?
151777 152986 You were warned, Lieutenant.
153153 155238 I think we can handle one little girl.
158742 162079 You're wasting your time!<br />My men are bringing her down now.
162245 163288 No, Lieutenant.
164498 166375 Your men are already dead.
176968 178220 Seq, you with me?
178387 179429 This old code keeps crashing.
179596 181098 Your projection's breaking up.<br />Switch to audio.
181264 183767 Bugs, this is a direct violation<br />of the general's protocols.
183934 187020 I know, I know.<br />But something is happening here.
187938 189606 Something important.
189773 190857 Fuck.
191024 192442 We know what happens next.
192609 194236 She kicks their ass.
216842 218176 Now she makes a call.
218343 219386 The line was traced.
219761 221888 - And then...<br />- Then she runs for her life.
222055 223265 Are there any Agents?
223432 224766 We know this story.
226393 227936 This is how it all began.
228687 230063 God damn it.
230647 231732 This is where he began.
232274 235152 You're thinking this Modal is a loop?<br />Or a treadmill?
235652 238947 Some sort of sequencer<br />evolving a program to do what?
239114 240240 I don't know.
241491 242951 But I'm going to find out.
243118 244244 All right.
275066 277319 So déjà vu<br />and yet it's obviously all wrong.
277486 279446 Why use old code<br />to mirror something new?
279613 280989 I don't know.
294753 297547 If that's supposed to be Trinity,<br />that's not what happens.
299674 301551 Maybe this isn't the story<br />we think it is.
301718 304054 Bugs, you have to get out of here.
304221 306264 It's gotta be a trap.
307724 308725 Shit.
347889 349266 You all carry on.
349724 350725 As you were.
353770 355272 I'm just gonna...
356231 357566 see myself out.
358024 359025 Kill her.
393226 394936 Seq!
462796 464130 - Why did you save me?<br />- You first.
464297 465799 Who are you? Where did you come from?
465966 467008 Okay.
467634 468843 My name is Bugs.
469469 471721 As in "Bunny."
471888 473515 And tech that listens.
474683 476559 Do you know this is a Modal?
477852 478937 What's a Modal?
479104 481314 It's a simulation<br />used to evolve programs.
485235 487070 Do you understand that you are...
488029 489614 digital sentience?
489781 491408 I know what I am.
491574 494869 Just like I know my job is to hunt down<br />and destroy sentience...
495036 496246 like you.
500458 501960 And yet...
503753 504754 Here we are.
505171 506548 Here we are.
508216 510301 The other Agents<br />don't know about this room?
512303 513513 How'd you find it?
513680 515598 No one was ever in the key shop,
516182 517308 so I started looking.
518601 520562 More you looked, the more you found.
521646 523189 Story of my life.
530321 531322 What?
533575 535076 I feel like I know this room.
543752 546129 Holy shit.
548590 550008 This is his apartment.
551342 553136 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
553553 555430 I searched everywhere. He doesn't exist.
555597 557766 He stopped being Thomas a long time ago,
557932 560143 but maybe you know him by his real name.
560894 561978 Neo.
563480 564689 You do.
565774 567358 Okay.
569527 572155 I can't believe this,<br />after all these years.
572322 575784 You see, most people<br />think that Neo is dead.
577202 578536 But I know he's not.
579579 581247 Because I've seen him.
583500 584501 Where?
585585 587921 It's not something<br />I can explain easily, but...
592592 595178 But the moment he looked at me,
595720 597263 I felt something...
600683 602310 unlock my mind.
604854 605939 Okay.
608399 610193 Something like that happened to me.
615198 616783 I saw this pattern...
618159 619494 and it was everywhere.
621329 623623 We can't see it,<br />but we're all trapped inside
623706 625291 these strange, repeating loops.
626334 629087 Somehow, I saw it in the mirror.
629712 632298 Just a flicker,<br />but it was like you said.
637887 639764 And suddenly I understood.
640348 642725 This is not the real world.
645436 648523 For the first time,<br />I felt real purpose.
649232 650733 I knew who I was
651317 653153 and what I had to do.
653820 655238 Who are you?
656656 658283 What do you have to do?
661244 662537 I am...
663371 664706 Morpheus.
665915 668126 And I have to find Neo.
672297 673631 Morpheus.
676634 678178 Okay. Okay.
678344 679387 My God!
679554 680722 I have to get you out of here.
680889 683016 I need to figure out<br />who built this Modal.
683433 685018 Okay, come with me.
685185 687145 You have to be ready to leave.<br />You have to be really ready.
687312 688313 And if you're not,
688396 689606 if you think that<br />this is where you belong...
693193 694402 You call this a choice?
694569 696196 Honestly, when somebody<br />offered me these things,
696362 697780 I went off on<br />binary conceptions of the world
697947 699532 and said there was no way<br />I was swallowing
699616 701409 some symbolic reduction of my life.
701576 703953 And the woman with the pills laughed<br />'cause I was missing the point.
704120 705663 What point?
705830 707832 The choice is an illusion.
708833 710919 You already know what you have to do.
717675 718760 Truth.
725475 726476 Okay.
726643 729395 There's an old building<br />with a skylight and lots of stairs.
729562 730730 The Lafayette.
730897 732357 One of the four back doors leads there.
734525 735693 - Don't fight it.<br />- Whoa, what's happening?
736027 737028 Keep breathing.
737195 740531 Extraction works pretty much the same<br />for humans and programs.
743368 744369 Ouch.
746913 748206 Okay.
750833 752252 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
752418 754087 I've never worn<br />different glasses before.
754254 756256 Yeah, looks good. Which door?
757090 758758 - It's gotta be...<br />- Okay.
763846 765181 Agent White.
765640 766808 Agent Smith?
772605 773982 Go!
781281 782865 Seq! Can you hear me?
783032 784284 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
784450 785493 Can you get us to the window pane?
785702 787578 Bugs! Bugs! He's an Agent!
797839 800008 That window! Go hard!
846387 848681 What the...
855021 856731 What the hell?
873831 874832 Something wrong?
875333 877585 Just a little crash.
878169 880171 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
880671 883758 What a beautiful day to be alive.<br />Am I right?
884509 886386 - Problemo?<br />- He lost something.
887845 889013 Is this old Matrix code?
891099 892683 A little Modal experiment.
892850 894644 For Binary?
895853 898398 - I need a coffee.<br />- Coffee. Yes, stat!
898481 899565 I'm buying.
902777 904487 I'm not trying to<br />blow smoke up your ass,
904654 908241 but the first time I played the trilogy,<br />I was shook.
909117 911494 The paradox<br />between free will and destiny.
911661 914038 Are we all just algorithms<br />doing what we're supposed to do,
914247 915957 or can we escape our programming?
916124 919085 Genius, inside the context of the game,<br />BT dubs.
920086 922130 Hey, did I tell you<br />it took over my life?
922296 924590 Yeah. I failed the seventh grade.
925049 926384 Your game almost ruined me.
927301 929846 - So you've said.<br />- Yet here we are.
929929 932598 You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
932723 933724 is it free will
935017 936602 or destiny?
941274 942942 Yeah.
943317 944735 There she is.
945319 946779 Total f-ing MILF.
947738 949699 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
949991 952118 I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.
952285 953494 Maybe you should go.
953661 956539 No, please. I... I promise, best self.
956706 957915 Best self.
961836 963087 Sure.
964046 965381 You ever talk to her?
967550 968551 Tell you what.
968676 972930 For all you've done for me,<br />let me do this for you.
973514 975391 Jude, no. Stop.
976434 977935 - Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Thanks.
978102 979604 Hi. Um...
979770 982523 I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.<br />I'm Jude Gallagher.
983191 985568 I work for a game company<br />called Deus Machina.
985735 987028 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
987195 989989 Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.
990156 992074 - Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.<br />- Jude.
992241 995995 And this is my very good friend,<br />Thomas Anderson.
996162 997914 He is a bona fide famous person
998080 999582 and considered by most to be
999665 1001459 the greatest game designer<br />of our generation.
1001626 1002793 I'm sorry about this.
1002960 1004086 - Jude...<br />- Just talk to her.
1004253 1006631 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.
1007507 1008716 Hi.
1015932 1017016 Have we met?
1018559 1020686 We both come here.
1020853 1022313 - Can I have your morning bun?<br />- Hey.
1022396 1023648 Are you trying to ball my mom or what?
1023814 1025107 Brandon!
1025191 1027026 Can I have one bite?
1027193 1030029 Babe. What's going on?<br />We're gonna be late.
1030196 1032073 This is my husband, Chad.
1032240 1033908 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hey.
1035701 1037578 Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.
1037745 1039539 Right. Sorry.
1039956 1041499 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1065856 1066941 What?
1074407 1076659 Sorry. It's the boss.
1082832 1085668 "Billions of people<br />just living out their lives,
1086919 1088713 oblivious."
1090756 1092508 I always loved that line.
1093217 1094594 You wrote that one, yeah?
1097388 1099140 Every time I stand here,
1099599 1102560 I mean, O-M-G.
1103019 1104937 It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.
1106105 1107398 Right?
1109275 1110526 Yeah.
1111319 1112445 Sure.
1112653 1114447 Have a seat.
1117491 1118659 Smoke?
1119994 1120995 I thought you quit.
1121954 1123414 I quit calling it a habit.
1124498 1126250 Now it's just a guilty pleasure.
1128586 1131339 Maybe I can make this easy for you.
1132214 1134300 I know Binary is over budget.
1134467 1136510 This is not about Binary, Tom.<br />It's bigger than that.
1136677 1138137 This is about our future,
1138220 1140431 which is a sticky subject,<br />given our past.
1141098 1142266 What do you mean?
1143434 1144727 How's the therapy?
1145061 1146354 Good.
1147063 1148522 Any...
1149523 1150816 episodes?
1152610 1153694 No.
1154362 1156113 That's terrific.
1158074 1160701 Look, Tom,<br />I know we've always had our differences.
1161577 1163329 What did you say<br />about our first meeting?
1163496 1166332 We had all the chemistry<br />of an FBI interrogation.
1169377 1170711 But look at this place.
1171837 1173130 We did this.
1174507 1175716 Together.
1177093 1178469 Yeah.
1178636 1179845 Now what?
1180846 1183349 Things have changed. The market's tough.
1184558 1185768 I'm sure you can understand
1185851 1188187 why our beloved parent company,<br />Warner Bros.,
1188354 1190606 has decided to make a sequel<br />to the trilogy.
1190690 1191732 What?
1191899 1193859 They informed me<br />they're gonna do it with or without us.
1194360 1195861 I thought they couldn't do that.
1197279 1198614 They can.
1198781 1199782 And they made it clear
1199865 1201867 they'll kill our contract<br />if we don't cooperate.
1202368 1203411 Really?
1204328 1207206 I know you said<br />the story was over for you,
1208290 1210292 but that's the thing about stories.
1212211 1213796 They never really end, do they?
1214338 1216757 We're still telling the same stories<br />we've always told,
1216924 1221011 just with different names,<br />different faces
1222805 1225725 and I have to say I'm kind of excited.
1228644 1229895 After all these years,
1229979 1232148 to be going back<br />to where it all started.
1232982 1235234 Back to The Matrix.
1236444 1238237 I've spoken to Marketing...
1244118 1245202 Tom?
1245661 1246704 Yeah.
1247371 1248372 Are you all right?
1250666 1251792 Yeah.
1256922 1258924 What were you feeling<br />at that point?
1262094 1263804 What was I feeling?
1267266 1271687 I felt either I'm having<br />a mental breakdown again
1272188 1276192 or I'm living inside<br />a computer-generated reality
1276358 1277818 that has imprisoned me...
1278486 1279612 again.
1290372 1291707 Not much of a choice.
1291874 1292875 No.
1293334 1294835 Maybe it's not as binary as that.
1295002 1298130 Maybe there are other ways<br />to understand what happened.
1298714 1299757 Yeah.
1299924 1302134 Thomas, you are a suicide survivor
1302301 1305012 gifted with a powerful imagination.
1305179 1307014 Those facts have combined
1307097 1309517 to create dangerous fictions<br />in your life.
1309683 1312269 Yesterday, you walked into a meeting<br />with your business partner
1312436 1313604 and he ambushed you,
1313771 1316440 demanding you make a game<br />you said you would never make.
1316607 1319360 This attack<br />effectively took away your voice.
1320027 1322655 His violence triggered you<br />and your mind fought back.
1322822 1324532 You did to him<br />what he was doing to you.
1326158 1330329 We've talked about the value<br />of adaptive anger in healing trauma.
1331372 1334500 Far from suggesting<br />a repeat of your initial breakdown,
1334667 1337670 I believe this episode<br />demonstrates healthy self-protection.
1339421 1340589 And more importantly,
1340673 1343843 I remember how hard it was<br />for you to share something like this.
1344802 1347346 Which tells me just how far we've come.
1352643 1354687 Do you need a refill<br />on your prescription?
1356605 1357773 Yeah.
1380546 1382673 First of all,<br />I know I speak for everyone
1382840 1385092 when I say that I'm so, so excited
1385259 1388762 to be working on a game<br />that was such a, well, game changer.
1389513 1393726 Now, the packet in front of you<br />has our focus group research.
1393851 1395311 Inside, you'll find the breakdown,
1395477 1398397 including key word association<br />with the brand.
1398564 1401609 The top two<br />being "originality" and "fresh,"
1401775 1403652 which I think are great things<br />to keep in mind
1403861 1405905 as you begin working on Matrix 4.
1407573 1409033 And who knows how many more?
1424798 1427843 What made Matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1428052 1429219 On point.
1429595 1431513 People want us up in their grey space,
1431680 1434183 switching their synaptic WTF light on.
1443943 1447112 What made Matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1447279 1448948 People want us up in their grey space,
1449114 1450324 switching their synaptic
1450449 1453077 "What the hell is going on here?"<br />light on.
1463379 1467508 I didn't love the first one,<br />like some of you.
1467675 1470052 And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance
1470219 1472471 for anything that requires<br />a syllabus and a highlighter.
1472638 1474348 I like my games big, loud and dumb.
1474515 1476392 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1476558 1479061 Matrix means mayhem.
1483857 1485943 Mindless action is not on-brand.
1486026 1487027 She's right.
1487194 1490531 Matrix is mind porn.<br />Philosophy in shiny,
1490698 1492241 - tight PVC.<br />- Yeah.
1492449 1494243 Ideas are the new sexy.
1508549 1510217 Obviously The Matrix is about...
1510300 1512386 - trans-politics.<br />- Crypto-fascism.
1512553 1513554 It's a metaphor...
1513637 1515180 of capitalist exploitation.
1527860 1532031 This cannot be another reboot,<br />retread, regurgitated...
1532197 1534199 Why not? Reboots sell.
1537578 1539496 We are so far down<br />the wrong rabbit hole here, people.
1539663 1542708 You say Matrix to anyone...<br />You say Matrix...
1543500 1546378 Matrix... Matrix... Matrix...
1546545 1548380 this is what they see.
1554720 1557181 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
1557347 1559433 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1560142 1561143 That's two words.
1565314 1568317 We need a new "bullet time."
1571070 1574865 We need to revolutionize gaming again.
1575032 1578702 Revolutionize gaming again!
1604728 1606271 Afternoon, Tiff.
1606438 1607439 The ushe?
1607606 1609900 You know what, Skroce? I'm going wild.
1610067 1611985 I'll have a cortado today.
1612611 1614446 Fly that freak flag.
1615239 1616865 Mind if I get that?
1617032 1618033 Hi.
1619034 1620285 Hi.
1621286 1623247 I remember wanting a family,
1623789 1626834 but was that because<br />that's what women are supposed to want?
1628043 1629711 How do you know<br />if you want something yourself
1629878 1632422 or if your upbringing<br />programmed you to want it?
1635008 1639138 I pay my analyst a lot of money<br />to answer such questions for me.
1639596 1640806 Smart.
1640973 1644226 I should get more therapy<br />but honestly, I'm too goddamn tired.
1644810 1646436 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1648105 1650274 No. Never had kids.
1650440 1652901 Right, I knew that.
1653360 1655654 Sorry. I googled you.
1657823 1660200 So, what's it like<br />being a world-famous game designer?
1660367 1662828 Must be amazing.
1662953 1664371 A lot of hours.
1664538 1666498 Sometimes it is amazing.
1666665 1668125 Most times,
1669376 1670544 I don't know.
1670711 1673297 But you made The Matrix.<br />Even I've heard of that.
1673463 1676383 Yeah. We kept some kids entertained.
1677301 1679303 So, worth it?
1685767 1688145 Can I ask something about your game?
1688312 1689521 Sure.
1689688 1691899 Did you base your main character<br />on yourself?
1697154 1699072 There is a lot of me in him.
1701617 1704703 Maybe a little too much.
1706830 1708373 Can I ask you something else?
1708540 1709750 Please.
1711585 1713754 There's a woman in your game.
1714963 1715964 Trinity.
1717966 1720552 Which is a weird<br />coincidence also, right?
1722137 1723222 God, yeah.
1724640 1725849 I like her.
1727142 1728852 I like Trinity.
1729519 1730729 And I dig her Ducati.
1730896 1733774 Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.
1737277 1739696 My friend Kush and I<br />actually build them.
1739863 1740864 Really?
1740948 1743533 You have your analyst, I have my bikes.
1744785 1747496 So, I was looking at images<br />from your game.
1748163 1749164 At Trinity.
1750958 1754586 Well, I showed Chad a scene,<br />and I was like, "So, what do you think?"
1755796 1757631 He didn't get it until I said,
1758423 1760259 "Don't you think she looks like me?"
1762177 1763804 You know what he did?
1765180 1766390 He laughed.
1771270 1773981 And I laughed too, like it was a joke.
1774147 1775607 How could it not be, right?
1777859 1779444 Made me so angry.
1781071 1783282 I hated myself for laughing.
1785075 1788036 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1789371 1790455 Not too hard.
1790539 1793709 Maybe just hard enough<br />to break his jaw off.
1797337 1799047 And right now,<br />you're probably regretting
1799131 1800549 sitting down with me.
1802926 1806305 This is the best thing I've done<br />in a long time.
1811059 1812686 I have to take this.
1816356 1817357 Hi, this is Tiff.
1817524 1818608 God, no.
1820652 1822112 I'll be right there.
1822863 1825532 My... My, youngest<br />stuck a Lego up his nose.
1829161 1830162 I gotta go.
1832414 1834958 I hope I see you again.
1853101 1855395 There has been a report of an emergency.
1855854 1859691 Proceed calmly to the nearest exit<br />and leave the building immediately.
1859858 1861109 What's going on?
1861276 1863195 We probably just got swatted<br />by some 14-year-old.
1863362 1864821 Yeah, someone pissed<br />about the latest update.
1864946 1865947 Or they're just a dick.
1866114 1869201 Please move to the exits.<br />Building's being evacuated.
1890472 1892057 Sir, this way.
1897896 1899064 Jude?
1900607 1901650 Jude!
1908115 1910075 At last.
1913412 1916540 I wasn't too sure about the callback,<br />but, you know, it was hard to resist.
1916873 1917916 What?
1918083 1919543 Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.
1919709 1921962 Lightning, thunder and theater.
1922129 1923672 At last.
1924256 1928427 All these years later, here's me,<br />strolling out of a toilet stall.
1928969 1930011 Tragedy or farce?
1930178 1931847 I know you.
1932013 1933807 Not every day you meet your maker.
1933974 1935100 This can't be happening.
1935267 1936935 Most definitely is.
1937102 1939354 You can't be a character I coded.
1939521 1941523 One hundred percent natural.
1948989 1950031 How?
1950407 1952451 All the explanation you need.
1957372 1958498 No.
1958665 1960542 No, no, no.
1960667 1962419 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />What do you mean, "no"?
1962586 1965172 You wanted this, you did this.<br />This was your idea.
1965255 1969384 It was a test.<br />An experiment.
1970719 1971887 An experiment?
1973555 1975390 You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,
1975557 1976725 left me to bang my head
1976808 1979144 till I nearly lost my shit<br />searching for you,
1979311 1980937 as an experiment.
1981104 1982856 - The exit's breaking down.<br />- He hasn't taken the pill.
1983023 1984357 What? There's no time.
1984524 1986193 I know, I know. He's having a moment.
1986735 1988278 Does he know<br />how hard it was to hack that mirror?
1991323 1992365 Still open.
1993074 1996536 This... This can't be real.
1996703 1998330 Target acquired.<br />We got him.
2006004 2007297 This isn't happening.
2007464 2009925 It's in my mind. It's in my mind.
2010091 2011092 Hey, you!<br />Stop! Hold it!
2027234 2028735 This can't be happening.
2031905 2033615 Freeze! Don't move!
2042582 2043708 Neo!
2058640 2060016 My God!
2094759 2095844 Neo!
2100807 2102934 Mr. Anderson!
2103768 2104978 No.
2105145 2106146 It can't be.
2114988 2116781 I've missed you.
2132088 2133715 It's in my mind.
2134883 2136217 It's in my mind.
2144517 2145894 Can you hear me, Thomas?
2147187 2149189 Follow my voice.
2150273 2153777 Feel the tips of your fingers.<br />What are they touching?
2155779 2157155 The bell.
2159741 2161076 Do you hear the bell?
2164704 2167540 Do you remember what happened?<br />How you got here?
2169250 2170460 You must have walked.
2170627 2173088 I heard Déjà Vu outside,<br />opened my door, and there you were.
2178593 2180804 You feel like you can talk about it?
2181513 2182639 When we started working together,
2182806 2187185 you had lost your capacity<br />to discern reality from fiction.
2187352 2190063 You came to me<br />after trying to jump off a building.
2190563 2192691 You said you wanted to fly away.
2206246 2208915 We have made<br />a lot of progress since then,
2209082 2211292 but you seem<br />particularly triggered right now.
2211459 2212752 Can you tell me how it started?
2214796 2216464 He texted me.
2217632 2218925 Who?
2219092 2220510 Morpheus.
2223430 2224764 So, he's back.
2224931 2227016 It wasn't actually him.
2228309 2230937 It was a program I coded for a Modal.
2231688 2233732 And this Modal, Morpheus,
2233898 2236025 came to help you escape
2236109 2239529 from a virtual reality<br />called The Matrix?
2249581 2250999 Am I crazy?
2251833 2253501 We don't use that word in here.
2254335 2256129 What word should I use?
2257464 2260467 What word explains<br />what is happening to me?
2260759 2262343 Can I see the texts?
2264846 2266347 They were erased.
2271811 2274981 If we got in my car<br />and drove to your office,
2275148 2276900 what do you think we'd find there?
2277066 2278109 Nothing.
2280945 2282906 Because there was no attack.
2284157 2285700 No one was killed.
2286659 2288203 No one texted.
2288912 2290872 My mind made it all up.
2292457 2294542 Is that what I'm supposed to say?
2295126 2296544 Is that what you believe?
2297378 2298755 It felt real.
2299297 2300632 Of course.
2301341 2304260 It was your great ambition<br />to make a game
2304344 2306429 that was indistinguishable from reality.
2306679 2307680 To achieve this goal,
2307847 2310558 you converted elements of your life<br />into narrative.
2310934 2312936 Your sublimated anger toward<br />your business partner
2313102 2314729 cast him as your nemesis.
2315396 2319901 A married woman named Tiffany<br />became the Trinity of a doomed romance.
2320693 2324030 Even your dislike of my cat<br />made it into your Matrix.
2324864 2326491 There's nothing wrong with that.
2326658 2328117 It's what artists do.
2328284 2330245 But it becomes a problem
2330328 2333915 when fantasies<br />endanger us or other people.
2336334 2338503 We don't want anyone to get hurt,
2338670 2340004 do we, Thomas?
2348263 2350014 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.
2350473 2352392 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
2353017 2354602 No one can tell you<br />you're in love.
2354686 2356980 You just know it, through and through.
2357146 2359107 Balls to bones.
2359858 2361484 You feel this?
2363278 2364904 I'm never letting go.
2372787 2374622 You have to<br />let it all go, Neo.
2374789 2377083 Free your mind.
2397478 2399397 Looks easy enough.
2406321 2408865 "Free my mind." Shit.
2414037 2415496 Okay.
2416205 2417582 Free my mind.
2433806 2435350 I fly...
2436309 2437727 or I fall.
2446069 2447236 Who the hell are you?
2448154 2450281 You won't remember me,
2450448 2452909 but a long time ago, you changed my life
2453743 2455620 when you leapt off another roof.
2456329 2459082 Back then,<br />I was just like any other coppertop,
2459165 2460583 pretending my life
2461000 2464295 until I looked up and I saw you.
2465254 2467590 It was a different you, but I saw
2468424 2469467 the real you,
2470301 2472011 just a second before...
2473513 2474597 you leapt.
2479352 2481104 And you never fell.
2486567 2488569 Are you the one that hacked my Modal?
2489153 2490238 Yeah.
2491698 2494450 That'll be Jude. He's not your friend.
2494534 2496244 He's a handle,<br />a program used to control you.
2496327 2499205 He's on his way here,<br />and he's bringing Agents with him.
2500665 2501749 Jude.
2501916 2505211 Bro, I've been calling you all night.<br />We have a major problemo.
2506796 2508339 Are you alone?
2511300 2513219 That's kind of a sexy question, dude.
2514178 2516347 They don't look like<br />typical Agents.
2516514 2517849 They use bots now,<br />skinned as normal people,
2517932 2520601 which means they're everywhere<br />and you never know who to trust.
2521477 2523146 Why should I trust you?
2525440 2528359 Because if they open that door,<br />we lose our hack.
2528526 2530111 I will be caught and killed
2530278 2532655 and you will be put right back<br />on that treadmill they designed for you
2532822 2535199 just like they did the last time<br />you tried to leap your way out.
2536701 2539078 I know why you left your Modal open.
2539245 2541372 You needed someone else<br />to free Morpheus.
2541873 2543708 And it's because of him<br />that we were able to get to you.
2543875 2547545 I know these things the same way<br />that I knew one day I would find you.
2548713 2551132 And that when I did,<br />you would be ready for this.
2555845 2557096 If you want the truth, Neo,
2558514 2560349 you're going to have to follow me.
2561893 2562894 Okay.
2582538 2585166 - Where are we?<br />- Tokyo.
2585333 2587085 A moving portal<br />makes it harder to track us.
2587251 2589629 - Seq is the best of them.<br />- Portal's clean.
2589796 2591172 Reading no shadows.
2592757 2594342 I don't remember this.
2595510 2597595 We don't have to run<br />to phone booths anymore either.
2607230 2608606 Door's on your right.
2622912 2625164 Set and setting, right?
2625331 2626582 No.
2626749 2628126 It's all about set...
2629001 2630294 and setting.
2630461 2634465 After our first contact went so badly,<br />we thought elements from your past
2634632 2636008 might help ease you into the present.
2636175 2638845 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2639011 2640471 a little nostalgia.
2640638 2642807 This is footage from your game.
2650189 2652024 Time is always against us,
2652984 2654944 etcetera, etcetera.
2656195 2660658 No one can be told what the Matrix is,<br />blah, blah, blah.
2663369 2665204 You gotta see it to believe it.
2668875 2669876 Time to fly.
2672461 2673880 Wait.
2674046 2675047 If this is real,
2675214 2677967 if I haven't lost my mind,<br />does that mean
2679719 2681053 this happened?
2689937 2691522 But if it did,
2695693 2697153 then we died.
2697320 2699238 Obviously not.
2699405 2700823 Why the Machines kept you alive
2700990 2703743 and why they went<br />to such lengths to hide you
2703910 2705494 are questions we don't have answers to.
2705661 2706954 Hide me?
2707580 2711209 I've been at a company making<br />a game called The Matrix.
2711918 2714420 Doesn't seem like<br />they were trying to hide anything.
2714587 2716088 We've been tracking<br />that company for years.
2716172 2718799 We screened<br />every Thomas Anderson we found.
2718966 2722678 What we didn't understand<br />was that they could alter your DSI.
2723304 2725056 Pods generate your digital self-image
2725139 2727558 through a feedback system<br />called Semblance.
2727725 2729101 This is how you look to yourself.
2729852 2732730 Somehow they were able<br />to alter your DSI loop.
2733606 2735483 This is how everyone else sees you.
2750081 2751999 Twenty years?
2753459 2756921 Why did it take 20 years to find me?
2757088 2758881 It took a lot longer than that.
2759048 2761008 It's been over 60 years<br />since you and Trinity
2761092 2762677 flew to one of the Machine Cities.
2763386 2764387 What?
2764553 2766264 There's so much we don't know.
2766806 2768641 Like why you've barely aged,
2768724 2770851 or how many times<br />they've altered your DSI.
2771018 2772228 But based on what we do know,
2772395 2775231 it appears no one found you<br />because you didn't want to be found.
2775773 2778109 - That's not true.<br />- Maybe it isn't.
2778526 2780903 Maybe there's no foundation<br />to the rumors that you disappeared
2781070 2782530 because you were<br />working with the Machines
2782613 2783614 from the beginning.
2783781 2784949 Morpheus, stop.
2785116 2788160 All I'm saying is this is the moment
2788327 2790663 for you to show us what is real.
2790830 2792623 If you want out,
2793165 2794458 you'll take this pill.
2796085 2798337 But if you are where you belong,
2798504 2800589 you can go back to this.
2800756 2802049 Every day.
2802216 2805761 Over and over, forever.
2809223 2810433 Fuck.
2820568 2821652 Keep the loop tight.
2834248 2835291 Cybebe needs that tower pin.
2835458 2837209 I got a signal. It's faint.
2837376 2838753 It's definitely off-grid.
2845843 2848095 Captain. I'm tracking<br />a whole lot of weird.
2848262 2849597 - What?<br />- It's some kind of graft.
2855853 2857146 Thomas?
2858314 2860107 God.
2860733 2862234 No.
2863944 2865946 - We got company.<br />- How'd they find us?
2867365 2870284 Thomas, none of this is real.
2870451 2873662 You are in the midst<br />of a serious psychotic break.
2874580 2876499 - Lexy?<br />- Almost there.
2876665 2877875 Thomas?
2879001 2881629 Thomas, please. This is not a game.
2881796 2883255 Feel my hand.
2883422 2884548 This is what is real.
2887593 2889136 Stay with me.
2889512 2891055 No. No.
2894100 2895184 Stay with me.
2897812 2898813 Neo!
2902525 2903526 Morpheus!
2905194 2906487 Let's go, let's go!
2937059 2938978 - Bots are being activated.<br />- It's a swarm.
2963210 2964295 Come on!
2997828 2999079 I got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry.
2999246 3000247 Yes.
3001040 3002041 Come on!
3004126 3005127 Seq, where?
3007338 3010424 - That mirror.<br />- What? We'll never fit.
3010508 3012176 You gotta fit, 'cause I don't have<br />another way off this train.
3012259 3013302 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3014345 3015846 I know. I know.
3016013 3018974 Think perspective.<br />Closer you are, bigger it gets.
3022561 3024188 Okay, come on.
3025481 3026690 In you go.
3141513 3142848 Trinity.
3148187 3149188 No.
3230227 3233021 Welcome back<br />to the real world.
3241572 3242656 Trinity.
3242823 3243699 What's up, Doc?
3243782 3245492 His vital systems<br />have been meticulously maintained,
3245659 3247453 but it doesn't look good.
3253000 3255210 - We're losing him.<br />- Cold boot could shock him.
3255794 3256795 Do it.
3269975 3271435 I remember this.
3274146 3275647 The Construct.
3276523 3279026 In between everything
3279193 3280652 and nothing.
3281445 3283030 Welcome to the Crib.
3284823 3286658 I've been chilling here<br />in the ship network,
3290120 3291663 learning all about you.
3296376 3297503 And me.
3301465 3304009 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3305427 3308806 Are memories turned into fiction<br />any less real?
3312184 3315312 Is reality based in memory<br />nothing but fiction?
3315479 3317105 As to my role in all this,
3317189 3319775 my best guess is that you wrote me
3319858 3322069 as an algorithmic reflection<br />of two forces
3322236 3324363 that helped you become you,
3324822 3327741 Morpheus and Agent Smith.
3328325 3331995 A combo pack of counterprogramming<br />that was...
3334998 3337668 Let's just say,<br />more than a little bit crazy-making.
3338877 3341630 But it worked because here we are.
3342756 3344299 Now, for the bad news.
3344466 3346677 Your brain is hooked on this shit
3346844 3349471 The Matrix has been force-feeding you<br />for years.
3349638 3351348 Hooked bad.
3351515 3352975 You're going through major withdrawals.
3353141 3355477 Docbots are giving you crap odds<br />for surviving.
3356395 3358480 But, see, they don't know you like I do.
3361441 3363569 I know exactly what you need.
3385507 3386925 You gotta be kidding.
3389261 3390554 No joke.
3391388 3394641 Could be this is the first day<br />of the rest of your life.
3395434 3397185 But if you want it...
3400898 3402149 You gotta fight for it.
3403358 3406236 No. I'm done fighting.
3407279 3408280 Are you?
3451698 3453033 What the hell is he doing?
3454326 3456995 Yeah. They taught you good.
3462668 3465796 Made you believe<br />their world was all you deserved.
3465963 3467839 But some part of you knew<br />that was a lie.
3468006 3470550 Some part of you<br />remembered what was real.
3473345 3474471 You don't know me.
3475097 3476098 No?
3482104 3483105 Ooh.
3518890 3519808 I know you,
3519891 3522060 because I know the only thing<br />that still matters to you.
3522769 3525147 I know it's why you're here,<br />why you're still fighting
3525897 3527399 and why you will never give up.
3541580 3542873 Come on, Neo!
3544332 3545500 This is it.
3547711 3549087 This is your last chance.
3557345 3559890 You gotta fight for your goddamn life<br />if you want to see Trinity again.
3565062 3566354 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3569107 3571610 - Holy shit.<br />- Fight for her!
3623745 3625372 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3627332 3628792 Mind if I...
3642013 3643473 How are you doing?
3645142 3647144 If this plug is actually real,
3649229 3651439 that means they took my life...
3654151 3656361 And turned it into a video game.
3659573 3661116 How am I doing?
3662117 3663410 I don't know.
3664327 3666371 I don't even know how to know.
3667539 3668957 That's it, isn't it?
3670584 3672669 If we don't know what's real,
3674796 3675881 we can't resist.
3678884 3680260 They took your story,
3680427 3681845 something that meant
3683013 3685182 so much to people like me,
3686975 3689477 and turned it into something trivial.
3691354 3693064 That's what the Matrix does.
3693982 3696109 It weaponizes every idea.
3696902 3698278 Every dream.
3699946 3701573 Everything that's important to us.
3704284 3705368 Where better to bury truth
3705452 3708914 than inside something<br />as ordinary as a video game?
3709664 3711583 That sounds like the Oracle.
3713043 3714753 Heard so much about her.
3717672 3719090 She was gone before I was free.
3720759 3721760 Gone?
3721927 3725055 When this new version of the Matrix<br />was uploaded,
3726640 3728099 there was a purge.
3733188 3736733 They promised peace<br />and they gave us purge.
3738193 3739236 No.
3739778 3741446 No, there was peace.
3743073 3747244 You made it possible,<br />and it changed everything.
3748203 3750872 Doesn't feel like it changed anything.
3751831 3754334 The Matrix is the same or worse.
3755085 3757170 And I'm back where I started.
3760048 3762384 It feels like everything I did,
3763468 3764928 everything we did...
3771059 3773144 like none of it mattered.
3775438 3777023 All of it mattered.
3778817 3780277 I can show you.
3790996 3792539 This is my crew.
3795750 3797836 Our operator, Seq.
3800213 3803550 Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.
3804050 3805468 Nice to meet you.
3806594 3808096 Dad loved redwoods.
3808722 3811599 When he escaped the Matrix<br />and found out they no longer existed,
3811683 3812767 it almost killed him.
3813226 3814394 Lucky he met Mom,
3815312 3816396 and here I am.
3817105 3820692 This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.
3821443 3822610 Hi.
3822777 3825280 You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.
3825447 3827782 Roland was your grandfather?
3828616 3830702 He always laughed,<br />joking how he never believed in you.
3831911 3835040 But, in private, he said<br />that you freed his mind a second time.
3835665 3837751 Not to fanboy out here,
3837834 3839753 but this is kind of<br />a huge moment for me.
3839919 3841796 Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.
3842339 3843631 A what?
3843798 3846843 There's a lot of people<br />out there like me
3846926 3849137 who are a little bit obsessed<br />with your life.
3849304 3851598 I would never have recognized your Modal<br />if it weren't for him.
3851765 3854976 Whenever you're feeling up for it,<br />I've got, like, a million questions.
3855143 3857479 Me too. Starting with them.
3858855 3859856 It's okay.
3860648 3861649 Come meet him.
3861983 3863193 This is Cybebe.
3863360 3864778 That's Octacles.
3864944 3866946 That's Lumin8.
3867697 3869824 Machines are on our side now?
3869991 3872952 They are synthients.<br />It's a word they prefer to Machines.
3873119 3876456 Your contact with the Synthient City<br />had a huge impact on their world.
3876915 3877916 That's what I meant.
3878041 3880960 What you changed that nobody believed<br />could ever be changed.
3883004 3885131 The meaning of "our side."
3889344 3892263 Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives<br />to help get you out.
3893723 3894724 Thank you.
3896267 3897268 But why?
3897352 3899104 Not all seek to control.
3900146 3902023 Just as not all wish to be free.
3903858 3904943 What is that?
3905110 3907529 An exomorphic-particle codex.<br />It's pretty new.
3907695 3910782 It gives programs access to this world.<br />Within limits.
3910949 3913952 Limits are the domain of the limited.
3914119 3915203 Morpheus.
3915745 3916746 Thank you.
3916913 3918289 It was my honor.
3920166 3921418 Wow.
3921584 3922585 How does it work?
3922752 3924129 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3924295 3926673 If you want,<br />I can download the codex manual for you.
3926840 3929092 - Sure.<br />- Downloading used to be fun.
3929509 3931386 Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.
3931886 3933513 Can I ask them something?
3936641 3939561 When you unplugged me,<br />there was another pod?
3941146 3943898 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3945150 3946443 It could be Trinity.
3947318 3948528 It's her.
3949154 3951573 I figured we were going to<br />have this conversation.
3952282 3955160 Look, you were not<br />a typical flush-and-grab.
3955326 3957745 You were in this weird tower<br />that Cybebe had never accessed,
3957829 3958997 and she's now exiled.
3959164 3961207 We burned our one shot for you.
3961749 3963501 Even if it were Trinity<br />and she wanted to be free,
3963710 3965587 we have no idea how to do it.
3965753 3966754 Yet.
3969340 3971551 Nobody believed we'd ever find him,
3972177 3973178 but we did.
3975597 3976723 Okay.
3977765 3980727 We don't know how to get her out... yet.
3982979 3985440 Captain, we're approaching<br />security clearance.
3986774 3987775 We're here.
3988026 3989027 Zion?
3997160 3998286 Have a seat.
3998786 4001414 This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.
4001581 4003917 Quite a few synthients<br />deserve that title before me.
4004083 4005710 Mnemosyne, you are cleared for landing.
4005793 4006711 Welcome home.
4006878 4008463 Thank you, Control.
4008630 4010131 Um, we're about to crash.
4017138 4020517 General realized we were never going to<br />beat the Sentinels,
4020683 4022644 so we just got better at<br />hiding from them.
4027273 4028816 Welcome to lo.
4030443 4031569 Io.
4038368 4041037 Wow. That looks real.
4041538 4043122 Bio-sky.
4046834 4048545 Works kind of like grow lights.
4049295 4050922 It's way more complex than that.
4051089 4053466 It pulls water from the crust,<br />hydronating the air.
4053633 4056761 It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles.
4057887 4059180 Plus...
4060056 4061766 It is pretty to look at.
4061933 4063685 As opposed to that.
4065144 4067564 I guess the general<br />sent us a welcome party.
4085832 4087250 God damn.
4088376 4089544 It is you.
4090420 4091588 Niobe?
4093590 4096342 A few more wrinkles<br />and a few less teeth,
4097302 4100847 but wise enough to know<br />I don't know anything.
4101014 4103516 I sure as shit never saw this coming.
4104392 4105476 Neither did I.
4105643 4106769 I told you he was alive.
4106936 4109063 Captain, you and your crew<br />have been grounded.
4109230 4110523 General, if you'd just let me explain.
4110690 4113484 The protocols are put in place<br />for everyone's protection.
4113651 4116946 I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity<br />and I was afraid we'd lose him.
4117113 4119657 But, General,<br />people have been waiting for so long.
4121367 4122577 We found The One.
4124495 4126122 I don't believe in The One.
4128416 4129500 I never did.
4130168 4131252 No?
4132378 4133713 Me neither.
4134047 4138593 But there was a time<br />when you trusted me with your ship,
4139302 4141012 against the Council's orders.
4141179 4143139 The world was different then.
4145058 4146601 We were different.
4148728 4150063 Report to the docks.
4150229 4151856 Scrub down the Mnemosyne.
4152023 4154192 Transfer your access codes.
4154359 4155777 You are done, Captain.
4165453 4167246 We need to talk.
4172543 4174712 When word first came,
4175338 4177465 that it actually might be you,
4181427 4185014 I didn't know how I would feel<br />in this moment.
4192980 4194941 It is nice to see you.
4195108 4197652 It's good to see you too.
4203700 4206369 A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.
4206452 4208871 Yes.
4209497 4211165 A lot has changed.
4212750 4214627 Except maybe you.
4217505 4218965 You remember this?
4226222 4230768 It's so easy to forget how much noise<br />the Matrix pumps into your head
4230935 4232311 until you unplug.
4234147 4235189 Yeah.
4235815 4238568 Something else<br />makes the same kind of noise.
4238735 4240820 Takes over every damn thing
4240987 4242613 just like the Matrix.
4244282 4245283 War.
4247160 4249620 I stood at the barricade of the Temple.
4251581 4253708 Staring at the army of Sentinels,
4254959 4257462 waiting for them to kill<br />every one of us.
4259005 4262008 But then, they left.
4263301 4265636 They said you saved us.
4265803 4267013 I didn't believe it.
4267180 4270349 Every night I would dream<br />of attack sirens.
4271017 4272268 But then,
4274937 4277064 I would wake up to this...
4281068 4282528 silence.
4286073 4287658 I'm ashamed of it now.
4287825 4291704 My pessimism<br />of how long it took me to believe
4291871 4294957 a world without war was possible.
4296417 4297960 You gave me that.
4298544 4300880 You gave that gift to us all.
4301631 4305092 And it is the gift<br />that continues to bear fruit.
4307887 4309555 Come help me get up.
4309722 4311349 Let's take a walk.
4335540 4337500 Beautiful.
4338709 4341671 This is Freya, head of botany.
4341838 4344841 And this is Quillion,<br />our lead digitologist.
4345174 4349095 I presume<br />our guest needs no introduction.
4349262 4351722 Nothing travels faster than light.
4351889 4353140 Except gossip.
4355560 4356894 Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
4358980 4360189 A strawberry?
4360356 4364360 Using digital code from the Matrix,<br />we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.
4364527 4365987 And they grow here?
4366153 4370324 It's not easy augmenting the genome<br />to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...
4370491 4372076 We're getting there.
4372869 4374537 Go ahead. Try it.
4382086 4384338 We're quite excited<br />about the blueberries.
4384505 4386299 You remember that shit we used to eat?
4386465 4388718 That slop that tasted like rust.
4390511 4393848 Zion could have never<br />made something like this.
4394015 4395349 Why?
4395808 4398060 Because we needed synthients
4398436 4400479 and DI like him.
4400646 4403858 Zion was stuck in the past.<br />Stuck in war.
4404025 4406068 Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
4406569 4410239 They believed<br />that it had to be us or them.
4410406 4413242 This city was built by us
4413409 4415077 and them.
4420833 4422418 What happened to Zion?
4422585 4425796 I've been waiting<br />for you to ask that question.
4428007 4431344 All of the troubles<br />started in the Machine Cities.
4431510 4434764 Power plants were unable<br />to produce enough energy.
4435306 4438851 Nothing can breed violence<br />like scarcity.
4440645 4442271 For the first time,
4442438 4445483 we saw machines at war with one another.
4448736 4452490 We got word from the Oracle<br />of a new power rising.
4454617 4457119 That was the last we heard from her.
4460831 4461999 Morpheus.
4462166 4466629 After the siege,<br />he was elected unanimously.
4466796 4468798 High Chair of the Council.
4469799 4472802 How he loved that.
4473344 4477348 But as rumors of this new power spread,
4477515 4478724 he ignored them.
4478891 4483270 He was certain what you had done<br />could not be undone.
4483938 4487608 All of these people<br />never stopped believing in miracles,
4487775 4490111 believing in you.
4502206 4503541 I'm sorry.
4505543 4507920 How could I know this would happen?
4508087 4510172 We didn't understand<br />all of it back then.
4510339 4511966 No more than we do now.
4512383 4515469 I didn't come here<br />to cause you problems, Niobe,
4516595 4518264 but I need your help.
4519974 4521434 Trinity is alive.
4521600 4523227 Then there is another question.
4523394 4525062 Why did they keep her alive?
4525229 4526439 I can't answer that.
4526605 4529817 But if there's a chance I can free her,
4529984 4531652 I have to try.
4531819 4535489 Even if it means<br />endangering everyone in this city?
4539785 4541120 I'm sorry, Neo.
4541746 4545207 I won't let what happened to Zion<br />happen to Io.
4547168 4550838 I hope you'll forgive an old woman<br />for asking you to go with Sheperd here,
4551797 4554258 till we have better understanding<br />of what's going on.
4554925 4557762 You're going to imprison me<br />after I just got free?
4557928 4560806 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4561807 4563809 but neither does growing old.
4564769 4566729 But you don't hear me complaining.
4578741 4579825 Sorry.
4580785 4582703 I've never met a legend before.
4586082 4587166 Neo.
4588584 4589668 Sheperd.
4591629 4593422 Crazy. You're real.
4595382 4596509 "Real."
4597635 4599595 There's that word again.
4605309 4607144 People talk a lot<br />about the old days.
4607645 4609772 About you, the viral Agent.
4609939 4611565 The siege of Zion.
4612775 4614610 Everything was simpler back then.
4615694 4617196 People wanted to be free.
4619323 4620616 It's different now.
4621450 4624745 Sometimes it feels like people gave up.
4626080 4627164 Like the Matrix won.
4630543 4631919 This is you.
4636006 4638217 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4640344 4641971 Is it true you could fly?
4646809 4647810 Cool.
4678382 4679466 Morpheus.
4679675 4682636 General stuck you<br />in the Rapunzel tower.
4685222 4686724 On the upside, it's a nice view.
4686891 4688934 What happened to Bugs and the others?
4689101 4691812 They're supposed to be sterilizing<br />the Mnemosyne with a toothbrush.
4691896 4692855 "Supposed to be"?
4693022 4694273 Well, I could tell you<br />that they're standing by,
4694440 4697568 waiting for you to make the choice<br />to remain meekly incarcerated
4697735 4699862 or bust the hell out of here<br />and go and find Trinity.
4701530 4702531 But that ain't a choice.
4715336 4717296 General, what should we do?
4720925 4723385 Bugs has the same<br />independence of mind
4723469 4724929 she had the day you freed her.
4725095 4727890 This is not independence of mind.
4728057 4729058 It's mutiny.
4730476 4731477 Come on, 'Be.
4731894 4734813 I know how much you hated<br />locking him up.
4734980 4737608 Just like I know there's a part of you
4737775 4740653 that's relieved now that he's gone.
4742279 4745950 We've worked so hard to keep lo safe.
4748744 4750329 This scares me.
4760923 4762174 That's her.
4762341 4763384 On the bridge.
4763884 4764927 Got her.
4773727 4775938 It's sick how the Semblance works.
4776105 4777606 You see flashes of the real her,
4777773 4780401 but the way she reads...
4782278 4784738 Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.
4786824 4789702 This is a tough question, Neo,<br />but it has to be asked.
4790995 4792997 What if she's happy where she is?
4794540 4795708 How did I read?
4797835 4799712 Exactly like her.
4803590 4805259 Take us to broadcast depth.
4817104 4818480 Thank you for helping me.
4820274 4822109 Most of us are here because of you.
4824862 4827448 I also admit our only chance<br />to get out of the general's doghouse
4827614 4829116 is for you to find your mojo.
4830951 4833412 What if I can't be what I once was?
4835122 4836540 Then we're all fucked.
4836707 4838042 Two minutes.
4838208 4839501 Two minutes to broadcast.
4848886 4850054 I slipped you in<br />through a hotel room.
4851930 4853307 Should be safe.
4864151 4865277 Portal's open.
4865444 4867488 Closest I could get you<br />is the warehouse near her garage.
4868072 4869448 Whole zone's crawling with bots.
4870824 4872368 Let's go.
4899728 4901355 So, what do you think of him?
4903065 4905609 I was kinda worried at first<br />because he's so much older.
4905776 4908320 The beard, the hair...
4908487 4911115 - No, totally works for me.<br />- You idiot.
4911865 4913158 I mean "The One" thing.
4915035 4917413 You know, everyone that<br />shipped with him died.
4918080 4920666 Yeah. He's gonna<br />get us all killed for sure.
4926088 4927589 Predictable as ever.
4929842 4931218 Smith.
4931760 4933679 Smith? As in, the Smith?
4942229 4943313 This is so insane.
4943480 4944690 There's so many theories<br />about the two of them
4944898 4946525 and they're standing right there.
4946692 4948235 This code is freaky.
4948402 4951155 He's like an Agent, but not.
4955409 4956910 An appeal to reason.
4961206 4962708 How did you find us?
4962875 4965002 You never appreciated our relationship.
4965794 4967129 Not like The Analyst.
4967296 4969214 - The what?<br />- My doctor.
4969381 4973010 He used our bond<br />and turned it into a chain.
4973177 4974636 It's so obvious once you see it, right?
4974803 4977639 But this whole altered-code update<br />really blew my mind.
4978390 4980225 I still don't know how he did it.
4980392 4982603 You, as a balding nerd.
4983228 4984438 Hilarious.
4985063 4986899 And me...
4987524 4989359 Even more perfect.
4990444 4992154 Maybe a little too far<br />on the piercing blue eyes.
4992362 4993614 What do you think?
4994406 4996283 What do you want, Smith?
4998494 5002122 I have such dreams, Tom. Big dreams.
5002873 5005459 Well, mostly just extremely violent<br />revenge fantasies,
5005626 5006793 but in order for me to pursue mine,
5006877 5009087 I need to dissuade you<br />from pursuing yours.
5009171 5012716 Sounds like conflict.
5014468 5015969 Inevitable?
5017262 5018597 Doesn't have to be.
5018764 5020891 All you have to do<br />is stay out of the Matrix,
5020974 5022434 and leave the good doctor to me.
5022601 5024728 You can have him. I'm here for Trinity.
5024895 5026438 That's the trouble, Tom.
5026605 5028857 He knew you'd come, just like I did.
5030859 5032069 Trust me.
5033111 5034446 You're not ready for him.
5034613 5037449 Captain, I'm reading portals<br />from the lower frequencies.
5042913 5045916 I won't have his leash on my neck again.
5053590 5055634 I found some old acquaintances of yours.
5056760 5060055 Bugs!
5073777 5074820 Exiles.
5074903 5075988 I thought they were all purged.
5076154 5077239 You?
5078949 5080909 It is you!
5082578 5086164 All these years. I can't believe it.
5086832 5088458 God.
5088625 5092504 You stole my life!
5097509 5098927 What the Merv<br />is trying to say is that
5099011 5101471 their situation<br />is a little bit like mine.
5101638 5103682 To have their lives back,<br />yours has to end.
5107352 5108353 Kill him!
5121700 5124161 You ruined
5124328 5127289 every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5127456 5130000 We had grace.
5135088 5136590 We had style!
5136757 5138759 We had conversation!
5138925 5140761 Not this...
5165410 5168789 Art, films, books were all better!
5168955 5172125 Originality mattered!
5172292 5174169 You gave us Face-Zucker-suck
5174336 5177631 and<br />Couch-flix-climatey-Wiki-piss-and-shit!
5223844 5225345 I still know kung fu.
5227222 5228223 Neo!
5258003 5259421 Just like old times.
5317062 5318104 Neo.
5320190 5322192 I've been thinking about us, Tom.
5322984 5326071 About binaries that form<br />the nature of things.
5327405 5328657 Ones and zeros.
5329908 5330951 Light and dark.
5333161 5335163 Choice and its absence.
5338583 5340752 Anderson and Smith.
5377497 5379583 You've lost something, Tom.
5383712 5385380 You're not what you used to be.
5386673 5387716 It's true.
5401146 5403064 - Nice one.<br />- Thanks.
5410947 5412115 Come on, Neo.
5437140 5439225 Captain. You okay?
5439768 5442020 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5442812 5443855 Smith is killing him.
5444022 5445190 Where?
5452948 5454866 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5457661 5459579 After all,<br />you are the one who set me free...
5460872 5461873 again.
5464000 5466711 So you, more than anyone,<br />understands why I can't go back.
5469464 5471091 You should have listened to me.
5473426 5475053 Now you'll never see her again.
5488692 5489776 What was that?
5489943 5491277 That was Neo.
5492946 5493989 Mojo rising.
5502038 5503331 You all right?
5503498 5504499 Yeah.
5505208 5507544 - It's gonna trigger a response.<br />- I got multiple exits ready.
5507711 5509129 This is not over yet!
5509295 5511798 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5519014 5520265 We should go.
5520432 5521599 I can't.
5521766 5523685 I have to talk to her.
5523852 5527105 Neo, those Exiles were older than you,<br />and we barely handled them.
5530775 5532235 You really wanna do this now?
5537657 5538867 I mean...
5542912 5544289 you look like shit.
5555842 5558219 My God. What? What happened?
5558386 5559471 An accident.
5559637 5561848 Kush. Call a doctor.
5562015 5563516 It's fine.
5564517 5566144 I don't have a lot of time.
5566811 5568396 I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5568563 5571024 After we spoke, I realized
5571941 5573943 my life wasn't a life.
5575528 5580492 At some point, I think I gave up<br />searching for something real.
5586831 5588124 Wait.
5589667 5591294 Something happened.
5592420 5594631 I looked for you at the coffee shop.
5596549 5598760 I began to wonder if I imagined you.
5600095 5602097 And then last night I had a dream.
5603223 5605350 In the dream,<br />you were surrounded by police,
5605517 5607060 then they started chasing us.
5608228 5611064 - Us?<br />- You were on my bike with me.
5613274 5614609 How did it end?
5616027 5617195 Not good.
5619906 5623201 I've had dreams<br />that weren't just dreams.
5623368 5625495 You mean a dream that came true?
5633336 5635797 Finally, we can talk like adults.
5637632 5640593 I hate lying. I do.<br />It exhausts me.
5642554 5645890 Tiff and I have been waiting for you,<br />like, forever.
5652939 5654190 Déjà vu, right?
5656151 5658278 No use. You can't beat time.
5658444 5661948 This rewind is happening<br />faster than you can blink.
5666911 5668830 You gave me the idea.
5671833 5674961 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
5678047 5679090 "Bullet time."
5681050 5683094 I know. Kind of ironic,
5683261 5686806 using the power that defined you<br />to control you.
5687098 5689684 I kept such a close eye on you
5689851 5691477 and, still, you found a way out.
5692478 5694731 Clever monkey, using that Modal.
5695773 5698026 Call me an optimist,<br />but this could all be for the best.
5699360 5701779 The skin's not looking<br />too bad this time.
5702363 5704782 I know some of this<br />will be difficult for you to hear,
5704949 5706326 after everything you went through.
5706492 5707702 All that pain and suffering,
5707869 5710663 only to learn<br />the world doesn't end when you do.
5712207 5713291 Surprise.
5719380 5720757 I was there when you died.
5723259 5727722 I said to myself,<br />"Here is the anomaly of anomalies."
5727889 5730516 What an extraordinary opportunity.
5732310 5735146 First, I had to convince the Suits<br />to let me rebuild the two of you.
5735313 5738566 Why her? Getting there.<br />And don't worry, she can't hear me.
5738983 5741903 Resurrecting you both<br />was crazy expensive.
5742070 5743446 Like renovating a house.
5743613 5745657 Took twice as long, cost twice as much.
5749577 5752205 I thought you'd be happy<br />to be alive again.
5753248 5754624 So wrong.
5756376 5759963 Did you know hope and despair<br />are nearly identical in code?
5762006 5764008 We worked for years
5764175 5765718 trying to activate your source code.
5765885 5769097 I was about to give up,<br />when I realized...
5772183 5773226 Trinity.
5773393 5775603 it was never just you.
5775770 5778439 Alone, neither of you<br />is of any particular value.
5780441 5783569 Like acids and bases,<br />you're dangerous when mixed together.
5784195 5786364 Every sim where you two bonded,
5787240 5789200 let's just say bad things happened.
5791244 5792704 Neo!
5797166 5800295 However, as long as I managed<br />to keep you close,
5800461 5802171 but not too close,
5802338 5804590 I discovered something incredible.
5805633 5809095 Now, my predecessor loved precision.
5809262 5812682 His Matrix was all fussy facts<br />and equations.
5812849 5814600 He hated the human mind.
5814767 5817312 So he never bothered to realize<br />that you don't give a shit about facts.
5817478 5818896 It's all about fiction.
5819063 5823026 The only world that matters<br />is the one in here.
5823860 5826654 And you people believe<br />the craziest shit.
5827196 5828197 Why?
5828364 5831117 What validates<br />and makes your fictions real?
5832076 5833161 Feelings.
5834370 5835788 Allow me.
5837290 5838833 Kush here is one of my handlers.
5839000 5840251 They're everywhere.
5840418 5843087 Such a pain,<br />cloning Agents over a coppertop.
5843254 5845465 Far more effective<br />just to saturate a population.
5847550 5850303 And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.
5862732 5865818 Ooh! Nicely done.
5867445 5870114 You ever wonder why you have nightmares?
5870782 5873368 Why your own brain tortures you?
5873826 5876621 It's actually us,<br />maximizing your output.
5877330 5878456 It works just like this.
5878623 5881167 No. Can you stop the bullet?
5881334 5884337 If only you could move faster.
5884420 5886881 Here's the thing<br />about feelings.
5887048 5889133 They're so much easier to control<br />than facts.
5890176 5892095 Turns out, in my Matrix,
5892261 5895556 the worse we treat you,<br />the more we manipulate you,
5895723 5898059 the more energy you produce.
5898226 5899811 It's nuts.
5900603 5903481 I've been setting productivity records<br />every year since I took over.
5903648 5906317 And, the best part, zero resistance.
5906484 5907777 People stay in their pods,
5907944 5910321 happier than pigs in shit.
5911072 5912156 The key to it all?
5912323 5913574 You.
5913741 5914992 And her.
5915159 5917370 Quietly yearning<br />for what you don't have,
5917453 5919414 while dreading losing what you do.
5919872 5923918 For 99.9% of your race,<br />that is the definition of reality.
5924377 5926337 Desire and fear, baby.
5927463 5930216 Just give the people<br />what they want, right?
5939684 5942395 She's the only home you have, Thomas.
5942854 5946023 Come home<br />before something terrible happens.
5956451 5957452 - Bugs!<br />- I hear him.
5964041 5965042 Trinity!
5965126 5967003 - You shouldn't call me that.<br />- I'm sorry.
5968546 5969714 I have to go.
5969881 5971007 But I'll be back.
5972175 5974427 Neo! Time to go.
5977013 5978473 - Sentinels?<br />- Worse.
5980266 5982351 General ordered me<br />to look after the ship.
5982435 5983436 So you shadowed us?
5984437 5985938 Check your long-range scans.
5986105 5987940 Squids are combing this area.
5988107 5989192 He's right.
5989692 5992737 You can stay here and die,<br />or come back and face a court-martial.
5993404 5995323 And you call that a choice?
6002788 6004832 Sheperd should have left you<br />to the Squids.
6004999 6008127 I'm too damn old<br />to sit through some boring-ass trial.
6008294 6009420 Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
6009587 6011130 Do shut your mouth.
6011589 6013925 Do address me as General.
6014091 6018221 And do not rob my ex-captain<br />of her agency,
6018387 6020389 which she exercised with her own
6020473 6023809 particular brand<br />of shortsighted stupidity.
6025102 6026145 Shortsighted?
6028064 6031859 You care more about growing fruit<br />than freeing minds.
6032026 6034445 We are not going<br />to have this argument again.
6034612 6036447 It's not an argument. It's a fact.
6036948 6038074 You gave up on people.
6039700 6041911 I tell you what I'm going to give up on,
6041994 6043037 and it's you!
6045581 6048584 - Sheperd, get her out of my sight.<br />- General.
6050503 6051546 Disarm!
6051712 6053297 Kujaku's a friend.
6059887 6061389 Hello, friend.
6064058 6065059 Okay.
6066394 6067603 Him?
6074527 6075861 General.
6076362 6077613 Thank you for seeing me.
6077780 6081784 I figured if there was anyone<br />who could make sense of this mess,
6081951 6083661 it would be you.
6083828 6084870 Hello, Neo.
6085037 6086497 I know you.
6087039 6088916 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6092253 6093504 Why?
6093671 6095339 We met a long time ago.
6097091 6098134 Good morning.
6100970 6101971 Sati.
6102138 6104181 My father knew we'd meet again,
6104849 6106934 though he would have wished<br />for happier circumstances.
6107852 6109520 His inadvertent role<br />in what happened to you
6109687 6111772 was the greatest regret of his life.
6111939 6113733 I don't understand.
6115234 6118070 My father was the chief engineer<br />at the Anomaleum.
6118237 6119697 The what?
6119864 6122491 My father designed the resurrection pods
6122992 6124744 where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.
6126829 6127830 I'm sorry.
6128247 6129749 You knew what happened to him?
6129915 6132918 You knew that he and Trinity<br />both were alive,
6134003 6135338 and you didn't tell me?
6135504 6138174 There were times<br />I doubted my decision, Niobe.
6138341 6139967 But lo needed you.
6140134 6143471 This city needed to be built<br />for your people as well as mine.
6144805 6146265 If I would have told you everything,
6146682 6148601 you would have had<br />a very difficult choice to make.
6148768 6150311 My friends
6151729 6153898 let me make my own choices.
6154315 6156192 If it was a mistake,
6156359 6158319 you have my deepest apologies.
6160488 6161781 Why are you here now?
6161947 6164367 Neo's escape<br />has destabilized the Matrix.
6164533 6167036 The Anomaleum draws its current<br />from Trinity alone now.
6167328 6171290 A fail-safe has been triggered to reset<br />the Matrix back to the previous version.
6171624 6173334 But The Analyst halted the reset.
6173501 6176712 He's convinced the authorities<br />that you will soon return voluntarily.
6177963 6179340 And why would he say that?
6180091 6182927 Because if I don't go back,<br />he'll kill Trinity.
6185846 6188140 Faced with returning to your pod
6188307 6190351 or enduring Trinity's death again.
6191102 6192311 What would you choose, Neo?
6193437 6194689 I'll go back.
6196565 6198734 Well, The Analyst knows you well,
6198901 6201404 but that knowledge<br />has made him incautious.
6201570 6202613 After you escaped,
6202697 6205658 he should have accepted his losses<br />and devacuated Trinity.
6206492 6209078 But that would have prevented<br />this extraordinary opportunity
6209245 6211080 that now exists before us.
6211789 6213624 A few hours ago,
6214959 6218212 no one would have been able<br />to convince me
6218379 6222425 that I would be standing here,<br />trying to explain a mission
6222591 6224468 as crazy as this one.
6228347 6229890 What are you doing?
6230057 6231642 - Volunteering.<br />- No.
6231809 6236063 You are the one captain<br />that I am ordering to go.
6236397 6239567 Now you don't have to order me,<br />General, 'cause I'm volunteering.
6242987 6244488 I need two more.
6249076 6251370 Are you out of your minds?
6252037 6253789 You don't even know what it is.
6253956 6256292 General, we know you.
6256959 6260212 If you say this is important,<br />none of us is choosing to stay home.
6265634 6266677 Thank you.
6271849 6273768 Knuckle up and good luck.
6303964 6307301 Trinity is held in the Anomaleum,<br />which is in this transmission tower.
6307468 6309637 The passages used to rescue Neo<br />are now sealed
6309804 6311806 and a legion of Sentinels<br />patrols the tower.
6311972 6313933 So stealth will be paramount.
6314099 6315851 As long as we raise no alarms,
6316018 6317937 this first part of the mission<br />should be the easiest.
6318103 6321106 You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,<br />sneaking across an entire power plant,
6321273 6324527 climbing a two-kilometer tower<br />guarded by thousands of Sentinels?
6324652 6325694 That's the easy part?
6325861 6327112 Exactly so.
6327780 6329990 Because all we have to do<br />is convince someone
6330074 6331659 who does this every day
6331826 6333118 to take one of us along.
6356809 6360229 Fifty meters below the Anomaleum<br />is a stratum of amniotic filters.
6360396 6363399 Hidden along this edge<br />is a small hexagonal vent.
6363899 6366986 This vent feeds the air intake<br />into the corpuscular modifier,
6367152 6370030 which oxygenates<br />the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.
6370698 6371699 I get it.
6371866 6374869 The exomorph<br />slinkies up Neo's old umbilicus.
6376203 6377329 What could go wrong?
6424209 6426754 Once inside,<br />Morpheus will use the System Operator
6426921 6429673 to open the devacuator line<br />and disengage the macerators.
6434094 6435638 In order to unplug Trinity's body,
6435804 6437890 while her mind<br />still remains connected to the Matrix,
6438057 6440768 I'm gonna need a second human brain<br />to implement the bypass.
6440935 6442645 And since Neo must be with The Analyst,
6442811 6446899 the only available mind<br />that's a near-enough match is yours.
6448442 6449443 Figures.
6466919 6468003 Thanks, Cybebe.
6476428 6478305 Does Trinity still have to<br />take the red pill?
6478472 6481141 Since Kujaku and I are transferring<br />her consciousness onto the ship,
6481308 6482935 it's not strictly necessary.
6483102 6485813 But what matters<br />is that this is her choice.
6487147 6489400 Extracting a confused<br />or an uncertain mind
6489483 6491735 will, in all probability, kill her.
6491902 6494488 But even if it is what she wants,
6494655 6497992 won't The Analyst<br />just order the Sentinels to stop you?
6498158 6499243 He will.
6499910 6501829 But if my plan works, it won't matter.
6502287 6503288 Why?
6503455 6504957 Because we'll already be gone.
6506875 6510087 Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,<br />there has to be a reason why.
6512381 6515551 When my father realized<br />how the Anomaleum was going to be used,
6516135 6518887 he covertly transferred<br />the designs to me.
6519638 6521974 The Analyst discovered his betrayal,
6522141 6523934 and had my parents purged.
6526687 6529565 I would have been murdered too<br />if it wasn't for Kujaku.
6532776 6535362 Not a day goes by<br />that I don't grieve them.
6536947 6539658 I've been praying for this day<br />for a very long time.
6548042 6549460 We're coming up on broadcast.
6552254 6556050 I thought you should know<br />that I'm here because of her.
6559803 6561930 All I ever wanted<br />was to be as fearless as Trinity.
6564349 6567394 But I saw how she reacted in the garage,<br />and I...
6567770 6569980 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6570439 6571899 What if we're too late?
6573817 6575402 What if she's not Trinity anymore?
6580949 6583577 I never believed I was The One.
6584495 6585871 But she did.
6586955 6588540 She believed in me.
6591335 6593420 It's my turn to believe in her.
6618570 6620322 This is where it gets tricky.
6631667 6633877 Have you ever done<br />an operation like this?
6634586 6635671 Not yet.
6657442 6658777 Here we go.
6676420 6678046 Welcome home.
6678505 6680716 All I want is to talk to her.
6680883 6682217 Do you mean Tiff?
6682384 6685304 Come back, and you can talk to her<br />as often as you like.
6685470 6688432 I mean, handsome Chad<br />may have something to say about it.
6688599 6691685 If she tells me this is what she wants,
6692895 6693979 you win.
6694146 6695230 Really?
6695397 6697357 But if she wants me,
6698275 6700152 then you'll let us go free.
6700319 6703071 And why would I do something<br />as stupid as that?
6703238 6705824 Right now, I'm on a ship full of people<br />who will unplug me
6705991 6708285 before they'll let you take me back.
6708994 6710579 If you want this Matrix,
6711121 6712706 this is your only chance.
6712873 6715417 But how do I know<br />they won't unplug you anyway?
6715918 6719046 Same way I know<br />you'll let us walk out of here.
6744655 6745822 Okay.
6746448 6747908 I like tests.
6748867 6750410 We'll let Tiff decide.
6767970 6769096 That's it.
6770347 6771515 Bypass is ready.
6771932 6773267 Now what?
6773725 6774768 We wait.
6775143 6777062 Doesn't it seem crazy<br />to come all this way
6777145 6778522 and leave her here?
6778897 6780899 We must abide by her decision.
6781608 6783110 And if she says no,
6783986 6785362 what happens to Neo?
6785529 6789616 At this time,<br />the most important choice of Neo's life
6789783 6791201 is not his to make.
6822316 6824026 I saw this in my dream.
6825652 6828947 If I was the Oracle,<br />maybe I could explain it.
6829614 6831158 The Oracle.
6831325 6832951 From your game?
6834870 6837080 It's not a game.
6839207 6840417 God.
6848008 6851261 After you left, I went home
6851428 6853096 and I played it.
6855515 6856892 I kept thinking,
6858226 6861355 "Why does this story<br />feel like a memory?"
6868612 6870280 There's a part of me
6873158 6876078 that feels like I have been<br />waiting my whole life for you.
6879122 6881416 And that part is like,
6881583 6884252 "What the hell<br />took you so long?"
6885253 6887214 I don't have an easy answer.
6889466 6891551 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6893095 6894888 Afraid of what might happen.
6896598 6899393 Afraid of hurting<br />the only person I ever loved.
6901269 6904648 I wish I was who you think I am.
6906066 6907609 But look at me.
6908985 6910529 I can't be her.
6911321 6913281 - Mom!<br />- Mom! Come on.
6913448 6914574 - Mom!<br />- It's Callie.
6914741 6915742 Is this real?
6915909 6916910 You have to come with us.
6916993 6918078 Come on, we gotta go.
6918161 6919246 Tiff, hey.
6919329 6921206 Don't know what's going on here,<br />but I'm glad we found you.
6921373 6922791 - She got hit by a car.<br />- I know, it's crazy.
6922958 6924084 She was chasing after you.
6924251 6925293 They're casting her arm. We gotta go.
6925460 6926586 Doctor said she's gonna be fine.
6926753 6928422 You have to come with us<br />to the hospital.
6928880 6929881 It's too late.
6930048 6931091 I understand.
6931258 6933135 - Tiff, come on, let's go.<br />- Come on.
6939683 6940725 What's happening?
6942853 6944020 Neo was wrong.
6977304 6978388 Tiffany.
6982100 6984519 Tiffany, you have to come with us.
6986229 6987522 Tiffany!
6989983 6993487 I wish you would<br />fucking stop calling me that.
6993653 6995155 I hate that name.
6996698 6998283 My name is Trinity
6998450 7000660 and you better<br />take your hands off of me.
7011838 7012839 Neo!
7013340 7014341 Trinity!
7015550 7016551 Shit.
7017928 7019137 Get her out. Get her out!
7027896 7030357 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7031399 7033944 I own that mistake.<br />Shouldn't have pressed.
7034110 7036071 Women used to be so easy to control.
7037280 7041576 You know there's no way<br />I can let you two go free.
7045038 7046456 Cannot happen.
7049793 7052462 So, I guess it's déjà vu all over again.
7053588 7054756 She dies,
7055549 7056841 and it's all your fault.
7058426 7060971 Lies, lies and more lies.
7061721 7062931 Smith?
7063098 7065433 What has the world come to<br />when you can't even trust a program?
7065600 7067978 How...
7069104 7071398 Tom and I have more in common<br />than you know.
7071856 7074776 Once he got out, let's just say,
7075694 7077404 I was free to be me.
7085161 7087330 - Yeah!<br />- Trinity?
7136254 7137297 You ready?
7137464 7138757 Yeah.
7180882 7182300 No.
7183760 7186054 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7209911 7211204 Stop them.
7237105 7238523 You think this is over?
7238690 7240608 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7249743 7251911 Here, our unexpected alliance ends.
7253747 7255582 You know the difference between us, Tom?
7256416 7257834 Anyone could have been you.
7258376 7260295 Whereas I've always been anyone.
7265759 7266843 What just happened?
7267302 7268428 What?
7270555 7272849 No! Move! Move!
7273183 7274225 Get the hell out of there.
7278146 7279981 - How bad?<br />- Like, all the bad.
7281357 7282734 Yeah, this is bad.
7284277 7285737 I don't suppose you can still fly?
7296247 7297832 Yeah, that's not happening.
7323608 7324859 Neo! Get on.
7333618 7335370 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7335537 7337413 Everyone else, we stay with them!
7354639 7357016 - How is she?<br />- Life signs are good.
7360979 7362313 Her signal's strong, Captain.
7371239 7373241 Well done, Captain.
7375702 7377412 Now all we need is a miracle.
7405607 7406608 I hate bots.
7413072 7414866 - Get us out of here!<br />- I'm trying!
7415033 7416826 The lockdown is tracking.<br />Swarm is everywhere.
7416993 7418077 Never seen anything like this.
7463998 7466125 Seq, what is that?
7471172 7472256 What's wrong?
7474050 7475468 What are you...
7483142 7485061 He's turning bots into bombs.
7517552 7518636 Shit!
7518803 7519804 Lexy?
7534277 7535445 Sheperd's in trouble.
7538531 7539699 Jack me in.
7540616 7542410 I can get you in.<br />I don't know if I can get you out.
7548499 7550084 No!
7563514 7564557 What are they doing?
7568728 7570271 Herding them into a kill zone.
7603429 7604806 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7604889 7607058 Hang on, Lex.
7611312 7613064 Lexy!
7655398 7656482 There they are!
7682925 7684093 Morpheus!
7687972 7688973 Lex.
7689849 7691642 - Bugsy.<br />- Hell yeah!
7692643 7694228 Seq, where's Neo?
7694395 7695938 It's bad. They're pinned.
7696105 7697106 Heading to a roof.
7766509 7769136 Nodal fibrillation is critical.<br />She'll die if we don't extract.
7810177 7812763 It's so beautiful.
7828112 7829780 I remember this.
7831907 7834076 I remember us.
7852219 7854180 My dream ended here.
7865107 7866650 We can't go back.
7868778 7869862 We won't.
7889215 7890508 Can they make the jump?
7921664 7922832 I'm not doing this.
7923374 7924667 Are you doing this?
7948774 7949859 Bye.
8030940 8032483 How dramatic.
8033317 8034401 "Tiffany"?
8034818 8037655 It was a private joke.
8037821 8039281 An amusement, that's all.
8039448 8041534 An amusement?
8043577 8045579 Whoa.
8045746 8047122 Kind of like that?
8051377 8053796 Okay.
8054338 8056423 If you hated the name so much,<br />why did you heel
8056549 8058050 like a good little bitch so long?
8061220 8063305 Yeah. Definitely asked for that.
8068769 8070563 Can't you control her?
8076485 8078112 That was for using children.
8083075 8084577 We have a few questions.
8084743 8087913 - You tried to activate the fail-safe.<br />- The Suits tried.
8088080 8090249 Obviously, without control<br />of your source code,
8090416 8091750 I knew that was impossible.
8091917 8093961 So, why haven't the Suits purged you?
8094920 8096797 Because I know the system.
8097631 8099383 I know human beings.
8100134 8101635 And I know you.
8104930 8107308 Right now, you're feeling good<br />about what you've done.
8107474 8109727 You should. It was a victory. Bravo.
8110561 8111895 Now what?
8112062 8114690 You've come here<br />to negotiate some kind of deal?
8114857 8116275 You think you hold all the cards
8116442 8118736 because you can do<br />whatever you want in this world.
8118902 8121238 I say, go for it.
8121405 8123907 Remake it. Knock yourselves out.
8124074 8125993 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8126160 8127286 But here's the thing.
8127453 8130331 The sheeple aren't going anywhere.
8130497 8131749 They like my world.
8131915 8134752 They don't want this sentimentality.
8134918 8136670 They don't want freedom or empowerment.
8136837 8139214 They want to be controlled.
8139381 8141342 They crave the comfort of certainty.
8141508 8144178 And that means you two,<br />back in your pods,
8144345 8147681 unconscious and alone, just like them.
8152102 8154730 We're not here to negotiate anything.
8154897 8156982 We were on our way to remake your world.
8157149 8158567 Change a few things.
8158734 8161111 I kind of like the<br />"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.
8161195 8163364 Just remind people<br />what a free mind can do.
8163530 8164990 I forgot. It's easy to forget.
8165157 8167493 - He makes it easy.<br />- That, he does.
8167660 8169703 Something he should think about.
8170788 8174333 Before we got started,<br />we decided to stop by to say thank you.
8175167 8177961 You gave us something<br />we never thought we could have.
8178128 8179463 And what is that?
8180381 8181965 Another chance.
8845545 8848131 Face reality, people. Movies are dead.
8848298 8850133 Games are dead.
8850300 8852093 Narrative? Dead.
8852260 8854137 Media is nothing<br />but neuro-trigger response
8854220 8855221 and viral conditioning.
8855388 8856931 Wait, what are you two talking about?
8859225 8860393 Cat videos.
8861269 8864856 What we need is a series of videos
8865023 8867275 that we call "The Catrix."
