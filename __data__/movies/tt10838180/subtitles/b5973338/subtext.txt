57265 58965 - Seq, I'm in.<br />- Captain.
59000 60100 You were right.
60193 61611 The skylight<br />was a window pane.
61700 62900 I've got<br />serious interference.
62910 64510 Weird.<br />It's some kind of Modal.
64898 66691 Looks like old code.
66775 68151 It feels<br />really familiar.
68234 69986 Drop a pin.<br />I'll signal for backup.
70069 71738 - I'm gonna check it out.<br />- Bugs?
71821 73104 If the general finds out<br />we've been fishing...
73114 74783 A quick peek can't hurt.
74866 76159 Did you hear that?
76242 77642 Shit. I think<br />our signal was traced.
77702 79829 Bugs, this feels like a trap.
79913 81039 Bugs!
120995 123498 Freeze!<br />Do not move!
123581 124541 We will shoot!
124624 127919 Very slowly, raise your hands.
141808 143393 Here we go.
149232 150733 Hey, where are you going?
150817 152026 You were warned, Lieutenant.
152110 154362 I think we can handle<br />one little girl.
157782 158908 You're wasting your time!
158992 161244 My men are bringing her<br />down now.
161327 162412 No, Lieutenant,
163496 165498 your men are already dead.
176050 177302 Seq, you with me?
177385 178761 This old code keeps crashing.
178845 180253 Your projection's breaking up.<br />Switch to audio.
180263 181598 Bugs,<br />this is a direct violation
181681 182932 of the general's protocols.
183016 184434 I know, I know.
184517 186144 But something<br />is happening here.
187020 188771 Something important.
188855 189939 Oh, fuck.
190023 191608 We know what happens next.
191691 193359 She kicks their ass.
215882 217300 Now she makes a call.
217383 218635 The line was traced.
218718 220970 - And then...<br />- Then she runs for her life.
221054 222388 Are there any agents?
222472 223890 We know this story.
225433 227060 This is how it all began.
227769 229604 God damn it.
229687 231147 This is where he began.
231230 234484 You're thinking this Modal<br />is a loop? Or a treadmill?
234567 238112 Some sort of sequencer<br />evolving a program to do what?
238196 239364 I don't know.
240531 242158 But I'm going to find out.
242241 243368 All right.
273982 276359 So deja vu and yet it's<br />obviously all wrong.
276442 278611 Why use old code<br />to mirror something new?
278695 280321 I don't know.
293710 295044 If that's supposed<br />to be Trinity,
295128 296671 that's not what happens.
298631 300591 Maybe this isn't the story<br />we think it is.
300675 303052 Bugs, you have<br />to get out of here.
303136 305388 It's gotta be a trap.
306806 307849 Shit.
345553 346888 Uh...
346971 348765 You all carry on.
348848 349849 As you were.
352852 354395 I'm just gonna...
355313 357065 see myself out.
357148 358149 Kill her.
392308 394102 Oh, Seq!
461794 463212 - Why did you save me?<br />- You first.
463296 465047 Who are you?<br />Where did you come from?
465131 466674 Okay.
466757 468509 My name is Bugs.
468593 470887 As in "Bunny."
470970 472680 And tech that listens.
473764 475725 Do you know this is a Modal?
476976 478102 What's a Modal?
478186 480479 It's a simulation<br />used to evolve programs.
484275 486235 Do you understand<br />that you are...
487153 488821 digital sentience?
488905 490573 I know what I am.
490656 491908 Just like I know my job
491991 494076 is to hunt down<br />and destroy synthients.
494160 495411 Like you.
499582 501125 And yet...
502877 504212 Here we are.
504295 505713 Here we are.
507173 509467 The other agents<br />don't know about this room?
511427 512595 How'd you find it?
512678 515181 No one was ever<br />in the key shop,
515264 516474 so I started looking.
517642 519727 More you looked,<br />the more you found.
520770 522355 Story of my life.
529487 530488 What?
532657 534242 I feel like I know this room.
542875 545294 Holy shit.
547672 549131 This is his apartment.
550383 552468 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
552551 554512 I searched everywhere.<br />He doesn't exist.
554595 556847 He stopped being Thomas<br />a long time ago,
556931 559308 but maybe you know him<br />by his real name.
560059 561143 Neo.
562603 563854 You do.
564939 566524 Oh, okay.
567191 568484 Uh...
568567 571195 I can't believe this,<br />after all these years.
571279 574949 You see, most people<br />think that Neo is dead.
576284 577702 But I know he's not.
578661 580413 Because I've seen him.
582665 584458 Where?
584542 587086 It's not something<br />I can explain easily, but...
591591 594719 But the moment<br />he looked at me,
594802 596429 I felt something...
599765 601475 unlock my mind.
604020 605104 Okay.
607398 609358 Something like that<br />happened to me.
614280 615948 I saw this pattern...
617241 618659 and it was everywhere.
620286 622663 We can't see it,<br />but we're all trapped inside
622747 625291 these strange,<br />repeating loops.
625374 628627 Somehow I saw it<br />in the mirror.
628711 631464 Just a flicker,<br />but it was like you said.
636969 639347 And suddenly I understood.
639430 641891 This is not the real world.
644352 647688 For the first time,<br />I felt real purpose.
648356 650316 I knew who I was
650399 652318 and what I had to do.
652985 654403 Who are you?
655738 657448 What do you have to do?
660409 661702 I am...
662495 663871 Morpheus.
664997 667291 And I have to find Neo.
671462 672797 Morpheus.
675758 677385 Okay. Okay.
677468 678552 Oh, my God!
678636 679929 I have to get you out of here.
680012 682431 I need to figure out<br />who built this Modal.
682515 684100 Okay, come with me.
684183 686384 You have to be ready to leave.<br />You have to be really ready.
686394 687686 And if you're not,
687770 689530 if you think that<br />this is where you belong...
692274 693692 You call this a choice?
693776 695351 Oh, honestly, when somebody<br />offered me these things,
695361 696936 I went off on binary<br />conceptions of the world
696946 698586 and said there was no way<br />I was swallowing
698614 700491 some symbolic reduction<br />of my life.
700574 701974 And the woman<br />with the pills laughed
701992 703192 'cause I was<br />missing the point.
703244 704787 What point?
704870 707790 The choice is an illusion.
707873 710084 You already know<br />what you have to do.
716841 717925 Truth.
724640 725641 Okay.
725724 726934 There's an old building
727017 728602 with a skylight<br />and lots of stairs.
728686 729895 The Lafayette.
729979 731522 One of the four back doors<br />leads there.
732756 733556 Oh.
733566 735141 - Don't fight it.<br />- Whoa, what's happening?
735151 736235 Keep breathing.
736318 737758 Extraction works<br />pretty much the same
737778 739697 for humans and programs.
742533 743534 Ouch.
743617 744660 Ah.
746078 747371 Okay.
749915 751333 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
751417 753210 I've never worn<br />different glasses before.
753294 756046 Yeah, looks good.<br />Which door?
756130 757923 - It's gotta be...<br />- Okay.
762970 764680 Agent White.
764763 765973 Agent Smith?
771687 773147 Go!
780362 782031 Seq! Can you hear me?
782114 783365 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
783449 784769 Can you get us<br />to the window pane?
784783 786744 Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!
796921 799173 That window! Go hard!
845386 847846 What the...
854144 856105 What the hell?
872955 874290 Something wrong?
874373 877126 Uh... Just a little crash.
877209 879587 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
879670 883465 What a beautiful day<br />to be alive. Am I right?
883549 885551 - Problemo?<br />- He lost something.
886885 888178 Is this old Matrix code?
890180 891765 A little Modal experiment.
891849 894810 For Binary?
894893 897521 - I need a coffee.<br />- Coffee. Yes, stat!
897605 898731 I'm buying.
901734 903485 I'm not trying to blow<br />smoke up your ass,
903569 907990 but the first time I played<br />the trilogy, I was shook.
908073 910659 The paradox<br />between free will and destiny.
910743 911910 Are we all just algorithms
911994 913203 doing what we're<br />supposed to do
913287 914997 or can we escape<br />our programming?
915080 919001 Genius, inside the context<br />of the game, BT dubs.
919084 921170 Hey, did I tell you<br />it took over my life?
921253 924006 Yeah. I failed<br />the seventh grade.
924089 926258 Your game almost ruined me.
926342 928844 - So you've said.<br />- Yet here we are.
928927 931764 You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
931847 932890 is it free will
934141 935768 or destiny?
940439 942358 Oh, yeah.
942441 944360 There she is.
944443 945944 Total f-ing MILF.
946820 948906 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
948989 951283 I'm a geek.<br />I was raised by machines.
951367 952618 Maybe you should go.
952701 955746 No, please.<br />I... I promise, best self.
955829 957081 Best self.
961001 962252 Sure.
963128 964546 You ever talk to her?
966674 968092 Tell you what.
968175 972554 For all you've done for me,<br />let me do this for you.
972638 975391 Jude, no. Stop.
975474 977184 - Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Thanks.
977267 978686 Hi. Um...
978769 980354 I know this is all<br />a bit extemporaneous.
980437 982064 I'm Jude Gallagher.
982147 984733 I work for a game company<br />called Deus Machina.
984817 986068 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
986151 989071 Tiffany. Wow.<br />Didn't see that coming.
989154 991073 - Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.<br />- Jude.
991156 995077 Oh, and this is my very<br />good friend, Thomas Anderson.
995160 997079 He is a bona fide<br />famous person
997162 998539 and considered by most to be
998622 1000624 the greatest game designer<br />of our generation.
1000708 1001917 I'm sorry about this.
1002000 1003210 - Jude...<br />- Just talk to her.
1003293 1005796 Hi, Thomas.<br />Everyone calls me "Tiff."
1006672 1007881 Hi.
1015055 1016181 Have we met?
1017641 1019768 Uh, we both come here.
1019852 1021292 - Can I have your morning bun?<br />- Hey!
1021353 1022833 Are you trying<br />to ball my mom or what?
1022855 1024148 Brandon!
1024231 1026108 Can I have one bite?
1026191 1029194 Babe! What's going on?<br />We're gonna be late.
1029278 1031196 This is my husband, Chad.
1031280 1033073 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hey.
1034700 1036785 Babe, we gotta get<br />Callie to practice.
1036869 1038954 Right. Sorry.
1039038 1040664 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1065022 1066023 What?
1073489 1075824 Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.
1081747 1084833 "Billions of people<br />just living out their lives...
1086043 1087878 oblivious."
1089838 1092216 I always loved that line.
1092299 1093759 You wrote that one, yeah?
1096470 1098639 Every time I stand here,
1098722 1101975 I mean, O-M-G.
1102059 1104102 It's so perfect,<br />it's gotta be fake.
1105145 1106563 Right?
1108440 1109691 Yeah.
1110442 1111693 Sure.
1111777 1113612 Have a seat.
1116615 1117825 Smoke?
1119117 1120160 I thought you quit.
1121036 1123413 I quit calling it a habit.
1123497 1125415 Now it's just<br />a guilty pleasure.
1127584 1131171 Oh. Maybe I can make this<br />easy for you.
1131255 1133298 I know Binary is over budget.
1133382 1135676 This is not about Binary, Tom.<br />It's bigger than that.
1135759 1137094 This is about our future,
1137177 1140138 which is a sticky subject,<br />given our past.
1140222 1141431 What do you mean?
1142558 1144143 How's the therapy?
1144226 1145519 Good.
1146228 1147688 Any...
1148647 1149982 episodes?
1151775 1152860 No.
1153485 1155279 That's terrific.
1156989 1160492 Look, Tom, I know we've<br />always had our differences.
1160576 1162411 What did you say<br />about our first meeting?
1162494 1165747 We had all the chemistry<br />of an FBI interrogation.
1168458 1169877 But look at this place.
1170961 1172296 We did this.
1173672 1174882 Together.
1176258 1177718 Yeah.
1177801 1179761 Now what?
1179845 1183432 Things have changed.<br />The market's tough.
1183515 1185809 I'm sure you can understand<br />why our beloved
1185893 1187269 parent company, Warner Bros.,
1187352 1189771 has decided to make<br />a sequel to the trilogy.
1189855 1191273 What?
1191356 1193348 They informed me they're gonna<br />do it with or without us.
1193358 1195193 I thought<br />they couldn't do that.
1196403 1197779 Oh, they can.
1197863 1199197 And they made it clear
1199281 1201450 they'll kill our contract<br />if we don't cooperate.
1201533 1203243 Really?
1203327 1207205 I know you said the story<br />was over for you,
1207289 1209458 but that's the thing<br />about stories.
1211251 1213170 They never really end,<br />do they?
1213253 1215797 We're still telling the same<br />stories we've always told,
1215881 1220177 just with different names,<br />different faces
1221803 1224890 and I have to say<br />I'm kind of excited.
1227726 1228894 After all these years,
1228977 1231980 to be going back<br />to where it all started.
1232064 1234399 Back to The Matrix.
1235525 1237235 I've spoken to Marketing...
1243200 1244743 Tom?
1244826 1246370 Yeah.
1246453 1247496 Are you all right?
1249831 1250958 Yeah.
1255879 1258090 What were you feeling<br />at that point?
1261176 1262970 What was I feeling?
1266264 1271019 I felt either I'm having<br />a mental breakdown again
1271103 1275357 or I'm living inside<br />a computer-generated reality
1275440 1276984 that has imprisoned me...
1277609 1278777 again.
1289454 1290956 Not much of a choice.
1291039 1292249 No.
1292332 1293917 Maybe it's not<br />as binary as that.
1294001 1297295 Maybe there are other ways<br />to understand what happened.
1297879 1298964 Yeah.
1299047 1301216 Thomas, you are<br />a suicide survivor
1301299 1304177 gifted with<br />a powerful imagination.
1304261 1306013 Those facts have combined
1306096 1308598 to create dangerous fictions<br />in your life.
1308682 1310225 Yesterday,<br />you walked into a meeting
1310308 1311435 with your business partner
1311518 1312978 and he ambushed you,
1313061 1315480 demanding you make a game<br />you said you would never make.
1315564 1318900 This attack effectively<br />took away your voice.
1318984 1321737 His violence triggered you<br />and your mind fought back.
1321820 1323697 You did to him<br />what he was doing to you.
1325198 1326575 We've talked about the value
1326658 1330203 of adaptive anger<br />in healing trauma.
1330287 1333665 Far from suggesting a repeat<br />of your initial breakdown,
1333749 1334958 I believe this episode
1335042 1336835 demonstrates healthy<br />self-protection.
1338378 1340589 And more importantly,<br />I remember how hard
1340672 1343717 it was for you<br />to share something like this.
1343800 1346511 Which tells me<br />just how far we've come.
1351600 1353894 Do you need a refill<br />on your prescription?
1355771 1356938 Yeah.
1379544 1381755 First of all, I know<br />I speak for everyone
1381838 1384132 when I say that<br />I'm so, so excited
1384216 1386301 to be working on a game<br />that was such a...
1386384 1388470 well, game changer.
1388553 1390138 Now, the packet<br />in front of you
1390222 1393016 has our focus group research.
1393100 1394559 Inside, you'll find<br />the breakdown
1394643 1397479 including keyword association<br />with the brand.
1397562 1400649 The top two being<br />"originality" and "fresh,"
1400732 1402776 which I think are great things<br />to keep in mind
1402859 1405070 as you begin<br />working on Matrix 4.
1406613 1408198 And who knows how many more?
1423713 1427134 What made Matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1427217 1428510 On point.
1428593 1430595 People want us<br />up in their grey space,
1430679 1433723 switching their synaptic<br />"WTF" light on.
1433807 1436101 ["White Rabbit" playing]
1442858 1446194 What made Matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1446278 1448113 People want us<br />up in their grey space,
1448196 1449531 switching their synaptic
1449614 1452242 "What the hell<br />is going on here?" light on.
1462335 1466548 I didn't love the first one,<br />like some of you.
1466631 1469050 And, frankly,<br />I've got zero tolerance
1469134 1471553 for anything that requires<br />a syllabus and a highlighter.
1471636 1473513 I like my games big,<br />loud and dumb.
1473597 1475557 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1475640 1478226 Matrix means mayhem.
1482898 1485066 Mindless action<br />is not on-brand.
1485150 1486568 She's right.
1486651 1489696 Matrix is mind-porn.<br />Philosophy in shiny...
1489779 1491448 - tight PVC.<br />- Yeah.
1491531 1493408 Ideas are the new "sexy."
1507547 1509257 Obviously<br />The Matrix is about...
1509341 1511593 - ...trans-politics.<br />- Crypto-fascism.
1511676 1512594 It's a metaphor...
1512677 1514346 ...of capitalist exploitation.
1526816 1531196 This cannot be another reboot,<br />retread, regurgitated...
1531279 1533365 Why not? Reboots sell.
1536493 1538568 We are so far down the wrong<br />rabbit hole, here, people.
1538578 1542415 You say Matrix to anyone...<br />You say Matrix...
1542499 1545460 Matrix...<br />Matrix... Matrix...
1545543 1547379 ...this is what they see.
1554052 1556346 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
1556429 1558598 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1559266 1560308 That's two words.
1564312 1567482 We need<br />a new "bullet time."
1570068 1573989 We need to revolutionize<br />gaming again.
1574072 1577867 Revolutionize gaming<br />again!
1603768 1605520 Afternoon, Tiff.
1605603 1606771 The ushe?
1606855 1609024 You know what, Skroce?<br />I'm going wild.
1609107 1611609 I'll have a cortado today.
1611693 1614237 Fly that freak flag.
1614321 1616072 Mind if I get that?
1616156 1617198 Oh, hi.
1618199 1620201 Hi.
1620285 1622787 I remember<br />wanting a family,
1622871 1624164 but was that because
1624247 1626916 that's what women<br />are supposed to want?
1627000 1628783 How do you know<br />if you want something yourself
1628793 1631921 or if your upbringing<br />programmed you to want it?
1632005 1633006 Mmm.
1634049 1636009 I pay my analyst<br />a lot of money
1636092 1638678 to answer<br />such questions for me.
1638762 1639971 Smart.
1640055 1641264 I should get more therapy
1641348 1643767 but honestly,<br />I'm too goddamn tired.
1643850 1645602 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1647187 1649439 No. Never had kids.
1649522 1652275 Oh, right, I knew that.
1652359 1654819 Sorry. I googled you.
1656780 1659366 So, what's it like being<br />a world-famous game designer?
1659449 1661993 - Must be amazing.<br />- Uh...
1662077 1663578 A lot of hours.
1663661 1665705 Sometimes it is amazing.
1665789 1667290 Most times...
1668500 1669793 I don't know.
1669876 1672379 But you made The Matrix.<br />Even I've heard of that.
1672462 1676257 Yeah. We kept<br />some kids entertained.
1676341 1678468 So, worth it?
1684808 1687394 Can I ask something<br />about your game?
1687477 1688728 Sure.
1688812 1691064 Did you base your<br />main character on yourself?
1696194 1698196 There is a lot of me in him.
1700698 1703868 Maybe a little too much.
1705870 1707622 Can I ask you something else?
1707705 1708915 Please.
1710625 1712919 There's a woman in your game.
1714129 1715130 Trinity.
1716965 1719717 Which is a weird<br />coincidence also, right?
1721261 1722387 God, yeah.
1723763 1725014 I like her.
1726224 1728518 - I like Trinity.<br />- Ah.
1728601 1729853 And I dig her Ducati.
1729936 1732939 Another coincidence.<br />I love motorcycles.
1736234 1738945 My friend Kush and I<br />actually build them.
1739028 1740155 Really?
1740238 1743616 You have your analyst,<br />I have my bikes.
1743700 1748329 So, I was looking at images<br />from your game. At Trinity.
1750039 1751624 Well, I showed Chad a scene,
1751708 1753751 and I was like,<br />"So, what do you think?"
1754836 1757338 He didn't get it until I said,
1757422 1759424 "Don't you think<br />she looks like me?"
1761259 1762969 You know what he did?
1764304 1765555 He laughed.
1770268 1773146 And I laughed too,<br />like it was a joke.
1773229 1774772 How could it not be, right?
1776983 1778610 Made me so angry.
1780111 1782447 I hated myself for laughing.
1784115 1787202 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1788495 1789787 Not too hard.
1789871 1793082 Maybe just hard enough<br />to break his jaw off.
1796294 1798129 And right now,<br />you're probably regretting
1798213 1799714 sitting down with me.
1801883 1805762 This is the best thing<br />I've done in a long time.
1810141 1811851 I have to take this.
1815480 1816564 Hi, this is Tiff.
1816648 1817732 Oh, God, no.
1819776 1821778 I'll be right there.
1821861 1824697 My, uh, youngest<br />stuck a Lego up his nose.
1825615 1826866 Oh.
1828284 1829327 I gotta go.
1831496 1834123 I hope I see you again.
1852058 1853184 There has been a report
1853268 1854769 of an emergency.
1854852 1856771 Proceed calmly<br />to the nearest exit
1856854 1858898 and leave the building<br />immediately.
1858982 1860358 What's going on?
1860441 1862350 We probably just got swatted<br />by some 14-year-old.
1862360 1864018 Yeah, someone pissed<br />about the latest update.
1864028 1865446 Or they're just a dick.
1865530 1868283 Please move to the exits.<br />Building's being evacuated.
1889554 1891222 Sir, this way.
1897061 1898229 Jude?
1899731 1900815 Jude!
1907280 1909240 At last.
1911075 1912327 Ah.
1912410 1913870 I wasn't too sure<br />about the callback,
1913953 1915955 but, you know,<br />it was hard to resist.
1916039 1917165 What?
1917248 1918666 Morpheus Uno.<br />Reveal at the window.
1918750 1921210 Lightning,<br />thunder and theater.
1921294 1923171 At last.
1923254 1925673 All these years later,<br />here's me,
1925757 1928009 strolling out<br />of a toilet stall.
1928092 1929218 Tragedy or farce?
1929302 1930928 I know you.
1931012 1933014 Not every day<br />you meet your maker.
1933097 1934265 This can't be happening.
1934349 1936017 Oh, most definitely is.
1936100 1938561 You can't be<br />a character I coded.
1938645 1940688 100% natural.
1948154 1949364 How?
1949447 1951616 All the explanation you need.
1954827 1956454 Oh.
1956537 1957705 No.
1957789 1959540 No, no, no.
1959624 1961417 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />What do you mean, "no"?
1961501 1964128 You wanted this, you did this.<br />This was your idea.
1964212 1968549 It was a test. An experiment.
1969842 1971052 An experiment?
1972595 1974555 You put me<br />in a tiny-ass Modal,
1974639 1976015 left me to bang my head till
1976099 1978351 I nearly lost my shit<br />searching for you
1978434 1979936 as an experiment.
1980019 1982095 - The exit's breaking down.<br />- He hasn't taken the pill.
1982105 1983439 What? There's no time.
1983523 1985566 I know, I know.<br />He's having a moment.
1985650 1988111 Does he know how hard it was<br />to hack that mirror?
1990446 1992073 Still open.
1992156 1995576 This... This can't be real.
1995660 1997495 Target acquired.<br />We got him.
2005086 2006421 This isn't happening.
2006504 2008965 It's in my mind.<br />It's in my mind.
2009048 2010258 Hey, you!<br />Stop! Hold it!
2026357 2027900 This can't be happening.
2031028 2032780 Freeze! Don't move!
2041748 2042874 Neo!
2057764 2059182 Oh, my God!
2093925 2095009 Neo!
2099889 2102099 Mr. Anderson!
2102934 2104185 No!
2104268 2105311 It can't be.
2114111 2115947 I've missed you.
2131212 2132880 It's in my mind.
2134006 2135383 It's in my mind.
2143558 2145059 Can you hear me, Thomas?
2146310 2149105 Follow my voice.
2149188 2152900 Feel the tips of your fingers.<br />What are they touching?
2154944 2156320 The bell.
2158823 2160241 Do you hear the bell?
2163661 2166706 Do you remember what happened?<br />How you got here?
2168332 2169625 You must have walked.
2169709 2170918 I heard Deja Vu outside,
2171002 2172362 opened my door,<br />and there you were.
2177592 2180428 You feel like<br />you can talk about it?
2180511 2181791 When we started<br />working together,
2181846 2183598 you had lost your capacity
2183681 2186225 to discern reality<br />from fiction.
2186309 2189478 You came to me after<br />trying to jump off a building.
2189562 2191856 You said you wanted<br />to fly away.
2205202 2207955 We have made<br />a lot of progress since then,
2208039 2210374 but you seem particularly<br />triggered right now.
2210458 2211918 Can you tell me<br />how it started?
2213920 2215630 He texted me.
2216797 2218132 Who?
2218215 2219675 Morpheus.
2219759 2220843 Ah.
2222553 2223930 So, he's back.
2224013 2226182 It wasn't actually him.
2227350 2230645 It was a program<br />I coded for a Modal.
2230728 2232897 And this "Modal," Morpheus,
2232980 2234982 came to help you escape
2235066 2238694 from a virtual reality<br />called The Matrix.
2248746 2250790 Am I crazy?
2250873 2253334 We don't use that word<br />in here.
2253417 2256337 What word should I use?
2256420 2259757 What word explains<br />what is happening to me?
2259840 2261509 Can I see the texts?
2263970 2265513 They were erased.
2270768 2274105 If we got in my car<br />and drove to your office,
2274188 2276148 what do you think<br />we'd find there?
2276232 2277274 Nothing.
2279986 2282071 Because there was no attack.
2283280 2284865 No one was killed.
2285783 2287910 No one texted.
2287994 2290037 My mind made it all up.
2291455 2294125 Is that what<br />I'm supposed to say?
2294208 2295710 Is that what you believe?
2296502 2298379 It felt real.
2298462 2300214 Of course.
2300297 2303217 It was your great ambition<br />to make a game
2303300 2305678 that was indistinguishable<br />from reality.
2305761 2307221 To achieve this goal,
2307304 2309765 you converted elements<br />of your life into narrative.
2309849 2312101 Your sublimated anger<br />toward your business partner
2312184 2314395 cast him as your nemesis.
2314478 2316105 A married woman named Tiffany
2316188 2319525 became the "Trinity"<br />of a doomed romance.
2319608 2323779 Even your dislike of my cat<br />made it into your Matrix.
2323863 2325656 There's nothing wrong<br />with that.
2325740 2327199 It's what artists do.
2327283 2330661 But it becomes a problem<br />when fantasies
2330745 2333080 endanger us or other people.
2335332 2337710 We don't want anyone<br />to get hurt,
2337793 2339170 do we, Thomas?
2347261 2349388 Hi, Thomas.<br />Everyone calls me "Tiff."
2349472 2351891 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
2351974 2353601 No one can tell you<br />you're in love.
2353684 2356187 You just know it,<br />through and through.
2356270 2358773 Balls to bones.
2358856 2360649 You feel this?
2362359 2364070 I'm never letting go.
2371744 2373788 You have<br />to let it all go, Neo.
2373871 2376248 Free your mind.
2395017 2396477 Huh.
2396560 2398562 Looks easy enough.
2405402 2408030 "Free my mind." Shit.
2413202 2415246 Okay.
2415329 2416747 Free my mind.
2432972 2434515 I fly...
2435432 2437351 or I fall.
2445151 2446402 Who the hell are you?
2447278 2449363 You won't remember me,
2449446 2452700 but a long time ago,<br />you changed my life
2452783 2455161 when you leapt off<br />another roof.
2455244 2458164 Back then, I was just like<br />any other coppertop,
2458247 2459957 pretending my life...
2460040 2464170 until I looked up<br />and I saw you.
2464253 2466755 It was a different you,<br />but I saw
2467548 2469300 the real you,
2469383 2471177 just a second before...
2472636 2473721 you leapt.
2478475 2480269 And you never fell.
2485566 2487735 Are you the one<br />that hacked my Modal?
2488319 2489320 Yeah.
2490821 2492364 That'll be Jude.
2492448 2493782 He's not your friend.
2493866 2495399 He's a handle,<br />a program used to control you.
2495409 2496452 He's on his way here,
2496535 2498370 and he's bringing<br />Agents with him.
2499830 2501081 Jude.
2501165 2502605 Bro, I've been calling you<br />all night.
2502666 2504376 We have a major problemo.
2505920 2507504 Are you alone?
2510257 2513052 That's kind<br />of a sexy question, dude.
2513135 2515429 They don't look like<br />typical Agents.
2515512 2517004 They use bots now,<br />skinned as normal people,
2517014 2518214 which means they're everywhere
2518224 2520476 and you never know<br />who to trust.
2520559 2522311 Why should I trust you?
2524396 2527483 Because if they open<br />that door, we lose our hack.
2527566 2529276 I will be caught and killed
2529360 2530569 and you will be put right back
2530653 2531977 on that treadmill<br />they designed for you,
2531987 2533187 just like they did<br />the last time
2533197 2534397 you tried to leap<br />your way out.
2535699 2538118 I know why you left<br />your Modal open.
2538202 2540663 You needed someone else<br />to free Morpheus.
2540746 2542863 And it's because of him that<br />we were able to get to you.
2542873 2544750 I know these things<br />the same way
2544833 2547586 that I knew one day<br />I would find you.
2547670 2550297 And that when I did,<br />you would be ready for this.
2554885 2556262 If you want the truth, Neo,
2557513 2559515 you're going<br />to have to follow me.
2561058 2562059 Okay.
2581578 2584206 - Where are we?<br />- Tokyo.
2584290 2586125 A moving portal<br />makes it harder to track us.
2586208 2588836 - Seq is the best of them.<br />- Portal's clean.
2588919 2590337 Reading our shadows.
2591839 2594341 I don't remember this.
2594425 2596719 We don't have to run to<br />phone booths anymore, either.
2606312 2607771 Door's on your right.
2621994 2624371 Set and setting, right?
2624455 2625748 Oh, no.
2625831 2627291 It's all about set
2628125 2629376 and setting.
2629460 2631587 After our first contact<br />went so badly,
2631670 2633547 we thought elements<br />from your past
2633630 2635132 might help ease you<br />into the present.
2635215 2638052 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2638135 2639553 a little nostalgia.
2639636 2641972 This is footage<br />from your game.
2649188 2651190 Time is<br />always against us,
2652066 2654109 etcetera, etcetera.
2655319 2656445 No one can be told
2656528 2659823 what the Matrix is,<br />blah, blah, blah.
2662409 2664370 You gotta see it<br />to believe it.
2667998 2669583 Time to fly.
2671627 2673087 Wait.
2673170 2674421 If this is real,
2674505 2677132 if I haven't lost my mind,<br />does that mean
2678842 2680219 this happened?
2689061 2690687 But if it did...
2694817 2696360 then we died.
2696443 2698362 Obviously not.
2698445 2699863 Why the Machines<br />kept you alive
2699947 2702825 and why they went<br />to such lengths to hide you
2702908 2704743 are questions<br />we don't have answers to.
2704827 2706412 Hide me?
2706495 2710791 I've been at a company making<br />a game called The Matrix.
2710874 2713460 Doesn't seem like they were<br />trying to hide anything.
2713544 2715160 We've been tracking<br />that company for years.
2715170 2717965 We screened every<br />Thomas Anderson we found.
2718048 2719633 What we didn't understand
2719716 2722219 was that they could<br />alter your DSI.
2722302 2724054 Pods generate<br />your digital self-image
2724138 2726640 through a feedback system<br />called Semblance.
2726723 2728725 This is how<br />you look to yourself.
2728809 2732521 Somehow they were able<br />to alter your DSI loop.
2732604 2735107 This is how<br />everyone else sees you.
2749204 2751165 Twenty years?
2752458 2756003 Why did it take 20 years<br />to find me?
2756086 2757921 It took a lot longer<br />than that.
2758005 2760007 It's been over 60 years<br />since you and Trinity
2760090 2761842 flew to one<br />of the Machine Cities.
2762551 2763510 What?
2763594 2765804 There's so much we don't know.
2765888 2767639 Like why you've barely aged,
2767723 2769933 or how many times<br />they've altered your DSI.
2770017 2771351 But based on<br />what we do know,
2771435 2772769 it appears no one found you
2772853 2774688 because you didn't<br />want to be found.
2774771 2777524 - That's not true.<br />- Maybe it isn't.
2777608 2778817 Maybe there's no foundation
2778901 2780142 to the rumors<br />that you disappeared,
2780152 2781320 because you were working
2781403 2782843 with the Machines<br />from the beginning.
2782905 2784031 Morpheus, stop.
2784114 2787242 All I'm saying is<br />this is the moment
2787326 2789870 for you to show us<br />what is real.
2789953 2792164 If you want out,
2792247 2793624 you'll take this pill.
2795125 2797544 But if you are<br />where you belong,
2797628 2799797 you can go back to this.
2799880 2801215 Every day.
2801298 2804927 Over and over forever.
2808388 2809598 Fuck.
2819650 2820817 Keep the loop tight.
2833247 2834414 Cybebe needs<br />that tower pin.
2834498 2836375 I got a signal. It's faint.
2836458 2837918 It's definitely off-grid.
2844800 2847219 Captain. I'm tracking<br />a whole lot of weird.
2847302 2848762 - What?<br />- It's some kind of graft.
2855018 2856311 Thomas?
2857479 2859273 Oh, God.
2859898 2861608 Oh, no.
2862943 2865112 - We got company.<br />- How'd they find us?
2866405 2869283 Thomas, none of this is real.
2869366 2873579 You are in the midst<br />of a serious psychotic break.
2873662 2875747 - Lexy?<br />- Almost there.
2875831 2877916 Thomas?
2878000 2880836 Thomas, please.<br />This is not a game.
2880919 2882421 Feel my hand.
2882504 2883714 This is what is real.
2886717 2888510 Stay with me.
2888594 2890220 No. No.
2893098 2894308 Stay with me.
2896977 2897978 Neo!
2901690 2902691 Morpheus!
2904234 2905652 Let's go, let's go!
2936058 2938143 - Bots are being activated.<br />- It's a swarm.
2962292 2963377 Come on!
2996827 2998328 I got a hack<br />in the bathroom. Hurry!
2998412 2999413 Yes.
3000205 3001206 Come on!
3003250 3004292 Seq, where?
3006420 3008088 - That mirror.<br />- What?
3008171 3009923 - We'll never fit.<br />- You gotta fit,
3010006 3011456 'cause I don't have<br />another way off this train.
3011466 3012467 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3013510 3015011 No, no, no.
3015095 3016263 Think "perspective."
3016346 3018140 Closer you are,<br />bigger it gets.
3021685 3023353 Okay, come on.
3024604 3025772 In you go.
3140637 3142013 Trinity.
3147352 3148353 No!
3229225 3232187 Welcome back<br />to the real world.
3240737 3241905 Trinity.
3241988 3243188 - What's up, Doc?<br />- His vital systems
3243198 3244658 have been<br />meticulously maintained,
3244741 3246618 but it doesn't look good.
3251957 3254376 - We're losing him.<br />- Cold boot could shock him.
3254960 3256002 Do it.
3269099 3270600 I remember this.
3273269 3274813 The Construct.
3275605 3278233 In between everything
3278316 3280443 and nothing.
3280527 3282195 Welcome to the Crib.
3283780 3285824 I've been chilling here<br />in the ship network...
3289202 3290829 learning all about you.
3295542 3296668 And me.
3300505 3304342 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3304426 3307971 Are memories turned<br />into fiction any less real?
3311141 3314394 Is reality based in memory<br />nothing but fiction?
3314477 3317731 As to my role in all this,<br />my best guess
3317814 3319107 is that you wrote me
3319190 3321234 as an algorithmic reflection<br />of two forces
3321317 3323820 that helped you become you,
3323903 3327365 Morpheus and Agent Smith.
3327449 3328575 A combo pack
3328658 3331161 of counterprogramming<br />that was...
3333955 3337792 Let's just say, more than<br />a little bit crazy-making.
3337876 3340795 But it worked<br />because here we are.
3341838 3343423 Now, for the bad news.
3343506 3345717 Your brain<br />is hooked on this shit
3345800 3348678 the Matrix has been<br />force-feeding you for years.
3348762 3350430 Hooked bad.
3350513 3352033 You're going through<br />major withdrawals.
3352098 3355310 Docbots are giving you<br />crap odds for surviving.
3355393 3357645 But, see,<br />they don't know you like I do.
3360523 3362734 I know exactly what you need.
3384589 3386299 You gotta be kidding.
3386382 3387425 Uh-uh.
3388426 3390220 No joke.
3390303 3394432 Could be this is the first day<br />of the rest of your life.
3394516 3396351 But if you want it...
3399979 3401314 you gotta fight for it.
3402440 3405401 No. I'm done fighting.
3406444 3407445 Are you?
3450780 3452198 What the hell is he doing?
3453366 3456161 Oh, yeah.<br />They taught you good.
3461624 3464878 Made you believe their world<br />was all you deserved.
3464961 3466880 But some part of you knew<br />that was a lie.
3466963 3469716 Some part of you remembered<br />what was real.
3472468 3473636 You don't know me.
3474262 3475305 No?
3481269 3482270 Ooh.
3517972 3519599 I know you, because I know
3519682 3521601 the only thing<br />that still matters to you.
3521684 3524854 I know it's why you're here,<br />why you're still fighting
3524938 3526522 and why you will<br />never give up.
3540703 3542038 Come on, Neo!
3543456 3544666 This is it.
3546793 3548378 This is your last chance.
3556344 3557804 You gotta fight<br />for your goddamn life
3557887 3559222 if you want to see<br />Trinity again.
3564143 3565520 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3568147 3570775 - Holy shit.<br />- Fight for her!
3622827 3624537 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3626456 3627957 Mind if I...
3641137 3642638 How are you doing?
3644182 3646309 If this plug is actually real,
3648269 3650605 that means<br />they took my life...
3653149 3655526 and turned it<br />into a video game.
3658654 3660281 How am I doing?
3661240 3663284 I don't know.
3663368 3665536 I don't even know how to know.
3666662 3668122 That's it, isn't it?
3669624 3671834 If we don't know<br />what's real...
3673920 3675046 we can't resist.
3677965 3679425 They took your story,
3679509 3681010 something that meant
3682095 3684347 so much to people like me,
3685973 3688643 and turned it<br />into something trivial.
3690436 3692230 That's what the Matrix does.
3693064 3695274 It weaponizes every idea.
3696025 3697443 Every dream.
3698945 3700738 Everything<br />that's important to us.
3703199 3705493 Where better to bury truth<br />than inside something
3705576 3708621 as ordinary as a video game?
3708704 3710706 That sounds like the Oracle.
3712125 3713918 Heard so much about her.
3716712 3718256 She was gone<br />before I was free.
3719882 3721300 Gone?
3721384 3724220 When this new version<br />of the Matrix was uploaded,
3725721 3727265 there was a purge.
3732145 3735898 They promised peace<br />and they gave us purge.
3737358 3738818 No.
3738901 3740611 No, there was peace.
3742029 3747160 You made it possible,<br />and it changed everything.
3747243 3750746 Doesn't feel like<br />it changed anything.
3750830 3754041 The Matrix is<br />the same or worse.
3754125 3756335 And I'm back where I started.
3759088 3761549 It feels like<br />everything I did,
3762592 3764093 everything we did...
3770099 3772310 ...like none of it mattered.
3774520 3776189 All of it mattered.
3777940 3779442 I can show you.
3790119 3791704 This is my crew.
3794832 3797001 Our operator, Seq.
3799212 3803090 Sequoia. But everybody<br />calls me Seq.
3803174 3804634 Nice to meet you.
3805676 3807720 Dad loved redwoods.
3807803 3809055 When he escaped the Matrix
3809138 3810681 and found out<br />they no longer existed,
3810765 3812266 it almost killed him.
3812350 3813559 Lucky, he met Mom
3814435 3816062 and here I am.
3816145 3819857 This is Lexy,<br />Berg and Ellster.
3820608 3821734 Hi.
3821817 3824403 You knew my grandfather,<br />Captain Roland.
3824487 3826948 Roland was your grandfather?
3827740 3828824 He always laughed,
3828908 3830308 joking how he never<br />believed in you.
3830993 3832411 But, in private, he said that
3832495 3834622 you freed his mind<br />a second time.
3834705 3836749 Uh, not to fanboy out here,
3836832 3838834 but this is kind<br />of a huge moment for me.
3838918 3841420 Berg is our resident<br />Neo-ologist.
3841504 3842713 A what?
3842797 3845841 There's a lot of people<br />out there like me
3845925 3848261 who are a little bit<br />obsessed with your life.
3848344 3849512 I would never have recognized
3849595 3850795 your Modal<br />if it weren't for him.
3850805 3852125 Whenever<br />you're feeling up for it,
3852139 3854100 I've got, like,<br />a million questions.
3854183 3856644 Me too. Starting with them.
3857979 3859021 It's okay.
3859772 3861023 Come meet him.
3861107 3862400 This is Cybebe.
3862483 3863901 That's Octacles.
3863985 3866654 That's Lumin8.
3866737 3868990 Machines are on our side now?
3869073 3870283 They are synthients.
3870366 3872034 It's a word<br />they prefer to "Machines."
3872118 3873518 Your contact<br />with the Synthient City
3873536 3875913 had a huge impact<br />on their world.
3875997 3877123 That's what I meant.
3877206 3878457 What you changed
3878541 3880221 that nobody believed<br />could ever be changed.
3882044 3884547 The meaning of "our side."
3888342 3890177 Cybebe and Octacles<br />risked their lives
3890261 3891429 to help get you out.
3892888 3893889 Thank you.
3895433 3896475 But why?
3896559 3899103 Not all seek to control.
3899186 3901188 Just as not all<br />wish to be free.
3902982 3904233 What is that?
3904317 3906611 An exomorphic-particle codex.<br />It's pretty new.
3906694 3908821 It gives programs<br />access to this world.
3908904 3910114 Within limits.
3910197 3913200 Limits are the domain<br />of the limited.
3913284 3914827 Morpheus.
3914910 3915953 Thank you.
3916037 3917455 It was my honor.
3919248 3920499 Wow.
3920583 3921751 How does it work?
3921834 3923336 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3923419 3924587 If you want,
3924670 3925995 I can download<br />the codex manual for you.
3926005 3928424 - Sure.<br />- Downloading used to be fun.
3928507 3930885 Now it's all manuals<br />and diagnostics.
3930968 3932678 Can I ask them something?
3935598 3938851 When you unplugged me,<br />there was another pod?
3940186 3943064 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3944273 3945608 It could be Trinity.
3946442 3948027 It's her.
3948110 3951197 I figured we were going<br />to have this conversation.
3951280 3954200 Look, you were not<br />a typical flush-and-grab.
3954283 3955951 You were in this weird tower<br />that Cybebe
3956035 3958120 had never accessed,<br />and she's now exiled.
3958204 3960581 We burned<br />our one shot for you.
3960665 3962708 Even if it were Trinity<br />and she wanted to be free,
3962792 3964835 we have no idea how to do it.
3964919 3965920 Yet.
3968339 3971217 Nobody believed<br />we'd ever find him,
3971300 3972343 but we did.
3974762 3976681 Okay.
3976764 3979892 We don't know<br />how to get her out... yet.
3981936 3984605 Captain, we're approaching<br />security clearance.
3985898 3987066 We're here.
3987149 3988192 Zion?
3996283 3997743 Have a seat.
3997827 4000579 This is Hanno.<br />Best pilot in our fleet.
4000663 4001622 Quite a few synthients
4001706 4003165 deserve that title before me.
4003249 4004417 Mnemosyne, you are cleared
4004500 4005876 for landing. Welcome home.
4005960 4007628 Thank you, Control.
4007712 4009296 Um, we're about to crash.
4016220 4017471 General realized we were
4017555 4019598 never going to beat<br />the Sentinels, so...
4019682 4021809 we just got better<br />at hiding from them.
4026397 4027982 Welcome to Io.
4029608 4031026 Io.
4037450 4040202 Wow. That looks real.
4040703 4042288 Bio-sky.
4045875 4048210 Works kind of like<br />grow lights.
4048294 4049962 It's way more complex<br />than that.
4050045 4052506 It pulls water from the crust,<br />hydronating the air.
4052590 4055926 It balances the ECO<br />and our SRI cycles.
4057011 4058345 Plus...
4059180 4060973 it is pretty to look at.
4061056 4062850 As opposed to that.
4064143 4066729 I guess the general sent us<br />a welcome party.
4084997 4086415 God damn.
4087500 4088709 It is you.
4089585 4090753 Niobe?
4092588 4096175 A few more wrinkles<br />and a few less teeth,
4096258 4099929 but wise enough to know<br />I don't know anything.
4100012 4102681 I sure as shit<br />never saw this coming.
4103516 4104683 Neither did I.
4104767 4106101 I told you he was alive.
4106185 4108145 Captain, you and your crew<br />have been grounded.
4108229 4109855 General,<br />if you'd just let me explain.
4109939 4112566 The protocols are put in place<br />for everyone's protection.
4112650 4114527 I'm sorry.<br />I saw an opportunity
4114610 4116070 and I was afraid<br />we'd lose him.
4116153 4118823 But, General, people have been<br />waiting for so long.
4120491 4121742 We found The One.
4123577 4125287 I don't believe in The One.
4127540 4128666 I never did.
4129333 4130417 No?
4131502 4133045 Me neither.
4133128 4135506 But there was a time
4135589 4138259 when you trusted me<br />with your ship,
4138342 4140135 against the Council's orders.
4140219 4142304 The world was different then.
4144139 4145766 We were different.
4147810 4149228 Report to the docks.
4149311 4151021 Scrub down the Mnemosyne.
4151105 4153399 Transfer your access codes.
4153482 4154900 You are done, Captain.
4164577 4166412 We need to talk.
4171625 4174295 When word first came
4174378 4176630 that it actually<br />might be you...
4180384 4184179 I didn't know how I would feel<br />in this moment.
4192062 4194023 It is nice to see you.
4194106 4196817 It's good to see you too.
4202698 4205451 A long way<br />from Dozer's paint stripper.
4205534 4208495 Yes.
4208579 4210331 A lot has changed.
4211874 4213792 Except maybe you.
4216587 4218130 You remember this?
4225220 4227973 It's so easy to forget<br />how much noise
4228057 4229975 the Matrix pumps<br />into your head
4230059 4231852 until you unplug.
4233312 4234688 Yeah.
4234772 4237691 Something else<br />makes the same kind of noise.
4237775 4239985 Takes over every damn thing,
4240069 4241779 just like the Matrix.
4243447 4244448 War.
4246158 4248786 I stood at the barricade<br />of the Temple.
4250579 4252873 Staring<br />at the army of Sentinels,
4253999 4256627 waiting for them<br />to kill every one of us.
4258087 4261173 But then, they left.
4262383 4264843 They said you saved us.
4264927 4266095 I didn't believe it.
4266178 4269515 Every night I would dream<br />of attack sirens.
4270182 4271433 But then,
4274019 4276230 I would wake up to this...
4280234 4281694 silence.
4285155 4286699 I'm ashamed of it now.
4286782 4290786 My pessimism of how long<br />it took me to believe
4290869 4294123 a world without war<br />was possible.
4295541 4297543 You gave me that.
4297626 4300504 You gave that gift to us all.
4300587 4304258 And it is the gift<br />that continues to bear fruit.
4306969 4308721 Come help me get up.
4308804 4310556 Let's take a walk.
4334663 4336665 Oh! Beautiful.
4337750 4340711 This is Freya, head of botany.
4340794 4344089 And this is Quillion,<br />our lead digitologist.
4344173 4348177 I presume our guest<br />needs no introduction.
4348260 4350929 Nothing travels<br />faster than light,
4351013 4352264 except gossip.
4354641 4356060 Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
4358103 4359271 A strawberry?
4359354 4361065 Using digital code<br />from the Matrix,
4361148 4363567 we retro-convert it<br />into DNA sequences.
4363650 4365069 And they grow here?
4365152 4366779 It's not easy<br />augmenting the genome
4366862 4369406 to photosynthesize<br />Bio-sky, but...
4369490 4371241 We're getting there.
4371992 4373702 Go ahead. Try it.
4381210 4383420 We're quite excited<br />about the blueberries.
4383504 4385422 You remember that shit<br />we used to eat?
4385506 4387883 That slop<br />that tasted like rust.
4389468 4393097 Zion could have never<br />made something like this.
4393180 4394807 Why?
4394890 4397476 Because we needed synthients
4397559 4399520 and DI like him.
4399603 4402981 Zion was stuck in the past.<br />Stuck in war.
4403065 4405442 Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
4405526 4409404 They believed<br />that it had to be us or them.
4409488 4412491 This city was built by us
4412574 4414243 and them.
4419915 4421458 What happened to Zion?
4421542 4424962 I've been waiting<br />for you to ask that question.
4426922 4430384 All of the troubles<br />started in the Machine Cities.
4430467 4434179 Power plants were unable<br />to produce enough energy.
4434263 4438016 Nothing can breed violence<br />like scarcity.
4439768 4441353 For the first time,
4441436 4444648 we saw machines at war<br />with one other.
4447651 4451655 We got word from the Oracle<br />of a new power rising.
4453615 4456285 That was the last<br />we heard from her.
4459955 4461331 Morpheus.
4461415 4465794 After the siege,<br />he was elected unanimously.
4465878 4468755 High Chair of the Council.
4468839 4472259 Oh, how he loved that.
4472342 4476555 But as rumors<br />of this new power spread,
4476638 4478056 he ignored them.
4478140 4482769 He was certain what you had<br />done could not be undone.
4482853 4486815 All of these people never<br />stopped believing in miracles,
4486899 4489276 believing in you.
4501330 4502706 I'm sorry.
4504541 4506960 How could I know<br />this would happen?
4507044 4509338 We didn't understand<br />all of it back then.
4509421 4511256 No more than we do now.
4511340 4514635 I didn't come here<br />to cause you problems, Niobe,
4515677 4517429 but I need your help.
4519097 4520557 Trinity is alive.
4520641 4522392 Then there is<br />another question.
4522476 4524269 Why did they keep her alive?
4524353 4525604 I can't answer that.
4525687 4529024 But if there's a chance<br />I can free her,
4529107 4530651 I have to try.
4530734 4534655 Even if it means endangering<br />everyone in this city?
4538909 4540619 I'm sorry, Neo.
4540702 4544373 I won't let what happened<br />to Zion happen to Io.
4546166 4547542 I hope you'll forgive<br />an old woman
4547626 4550712 for asking you to go<br />with Sheperd, here,
4550796 4552297 till we have<br />better understanding
4552381 4553799 of what's going on.
4553882 4556927 You're going to imprison me<br />after I just got free?
4557010 4560806 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4560889 4563684 but neither does growing old.
4563767 4565894 But you don't<br />hear me complaining.
4577906 4579741 Sorry.
4579825 4581868 I've never met<br />a legend before.
4585247 4586331 Neo.
4587624 4589376 Sheperd.
4590752 4592587 Crazy. You're real.
4594548 4595674 "Real."
4596758 4598760 There's that word again.
4604266 4606643 People talk a lot<br />about the old days.
4606727 4608979 About you, the viral Agent.
4609062 4611690 The siege of Zion.
4611773 4613775 Everything was simpler<br />back then.
4614776 4616361 People wanted to be free.
4618447 4620365 It's different now.
4620449 4623910 Sometimes it feels like<br />people gave up.
4625162 4626872 Like the Matrix won.
4629666 4631084 This is you.
4635088 4637382 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4639426 4641136 Is it true you could fly?
4645974 4646975 Cool.
4677506 4678799 Morpheus.
4678882 4681802 Oh. General stuck you<br />in the Rapunzel tower.
4684262 4685764 On the upside,<br />it's a nice view.
4685847 4687933 What happened to Bugs<br />and the others?
4688016 4689800 They're supposed to be<br />sterilizing the Mnemosyne
4689810 4691937 - with a toothbrush.<br />- "Supposed to be"?
4692020 4693428 Well, I could tell you<br />that they're standing by,
4693438 4694758 waiting for you<br />to make the choice
4694773 4696608 to remain meekly incarcerated
4696692 4699027 or bust the hell out of here<br />and go and find Trinity.
4700612 4701697 But that ain't a choice.
4714334 4716461 General,<br />what should we do?
4719881 4722467 Bugs has the same<br />independence of mind
4722551 4724010 she had the day you freed her.
4724094 4727097 This is not<br />independence of mind.
4727180 4728223 It's mutiny.
4729558 4730809 Come on, 'Be.
4730892 4733895 I know how much<br />you hated locking him up.
4733979 4736690 Just like I know<br />there's a part of you
4736773 4739818 that's relieved now<br />that he's gone.
4741278 4745115 We've worked so hard<br />to keep Io safe.
4747868 4749494 This scares me.
4760046 4761339 That's her.
4761423 4762549 On the bridge.
4763091 4764092 Got her.
4772768 4775020 It's sick<br />how the Semblance works.
4775103 4777856 You see flashes<br />of the real her, but...
4777939 4779566 the way she reads...
4781276 4783904 Code-wise,<br />she's pure bluepill.
4785780 4788867 This is a tough question, Neo,<br />but it has to be asked.
4789993 4792162 What if she's happy<br />where she is?
4793622 4794873 How did I read?
4796958 4798877 Exactly like her.
4802631 4804883 Take us to broadcast depth.
4816186 4817646 Thank you for helping me.
4819272 4821274 Most of us are here<br />because of you.
4823944 4825070 I also admit our only chance
4825153 4826571 to get out<br />of the general's doghouse
4826655 4828281 is for you to find your mojo.
4829991 4832577 What if I can't be<br />what I once was?
4834120 4835747 Then we're all fucked.
4835830 4837207 Two minutes.
4837290 4838667 Two minutes to broadcast.
4847842 4849322 I slipped you in<br />through a hotel room.
4851012 4852472 Should be safe.
4863275 4864776 Portal's open.
4864859 4867060 Closest I could get you is<br />the warehouse near her garage.
4867070 4868613 Whole zone's<br />crawling with bots.
4869990 4871533 Let's go.
4898768 4901896 So, what do you think of him?
4901980 4904774 I was kinda worried at first<br />because he's so much older.
4904858 4907360 The beard, the hair... Oh.
4907444 4910864 - No, totally works for me.<br />- You idiot.
4910947 4912324 I mean "The One" thing.
4913992 4916953 You know, everyone that<br />shipped with him died.
4917037 4919831 Oh, yeah. He's gonna<br />get us all killed, for sure.
4925211 4926755 Predictable as ever.
4929007 4930759 Smith.
4930842 4933178 Smith? As in, "the" Smith?
4941311 4942604 This is so insane.
4942687 4944012 There's so many theories<br />about the two of them
4944022 4945690 and they're standing<br />right there.
4945774 4947359 This code is freaky!
4947442 4950320 He's like an Agent, but not.
4954491 4956076 An appeal to reason.
4960288 4961790 How did you find us?
4961873 4964793 You never appreciated<br />our relationship.
4964876 4966252 Not like The Analyst.
4966336 4968254 - The what?<br />- My doctor.
4968338 4972050 He used our bond<br />and turned it into a chain.
4972133 4973802 It's so obvious<br />once you see it, right?
4973885 4977305 But this whole altered-code<br />update really blew my mind.
4977389 4979391 I still don't know<br />how he did it.
4979474 4982268 You, as a balding nerd.
4982352 4984104 Hilarious.
4984187 4986564 And me...
4986648 4989317 even more perfect.
4989401 4991403 Maybe a little too far<br />on the piercing blue eyes.
4991486 4993405 What do you think?
4993488 4995448 What do you want, Smith?
4997617 4999911 I have such dreams, Tom.
4999994 5001705 Big dreams.
5001788 5004541 Well, mostly just extremely<br />violent revenge fantasies,
5004624 5006042 but in order for me<br />to pursue mine,
5006126 5008169 I need to dissuade you<br />from pursuing yours.
5008253 5011881 Hmm. Sounds like conflict.
5013591 5015135 Inevitable?
5016344 5017679 Doesn't have to be.
5017762 5019931 All you have to do<br />is stay out of the Matrix,
5020014 5021516 and leave<br />the good doctor to me.
5021599 5023935 You can have him.<br />I'm here for Trinity.
5024018 5025520 That's the trouble, Tom.
5025603 5028273 He knew you'd come,<br />just like I did.
5030024 5031234 Trust me.
5032193 5033737 You're not ready for him.
5033820 5036614 Captain, I'm reading portals<br />from the lower frequencies.
5041911 5045081 I won't have his leash<br />on my neck again.
5052547 5054799 I found some<br />old acquaintances of yours.
5055842 5059220 Bugs!
5072901 5073943 Exiles.
5074027 5075227 I thought<br />they were all purged.
5075278 5076780 You?
5076863 5077989 Oh!
5078072 5080408 It is you!
5081743 5085330 All these years.<br />I can't believe it.
5085997 5087665 Oh, God.
5087749 5091711 You stole my life!
5096466 5098009 What the Merv<br />is trying to say,
5098092 5100553 is that their situation<br />is a little bit like mine.
5100637 5102847 To have their lives back,<br />yours has to end.
5106518 5107602 Kill him!
5120824 5123284 You ruined
5123368 5126496 every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5126579 5129165 We had grace.
5134212 5135755 We had style!
5135839 5137841 We had conversation!
5137924 5139884 Not this...
5164409 5167954 Art, films,<br />books were all better!
5168037 5171249 Originality mattered!
5171332 5173251 You gave us<br />Face-Zucker-suck
5173334 5176796 and Cock-me-climatey-<br />Wiki-piss-and-shit!
5222926 5224510 I still know kung fu.
5226387 5227388 Neo!
5257085 5258586 Just like old times.
5316227 5317270 Neo.
5319188 5321858 I've been thinking<br />about us, Tom.
5321941 5325236 Look how binary is the form,<br />the nature of things.
5326487 5327780 Ones and zeros.
5328990 5330116 Light and dark.
5332243 5334287 Choice and its absence.
5337665 5339917 Anderson and Smith.
5376537 5378748 You've lost something, Tom.
5382710 5384545 You're not<br />what you used to be.
5385797 5386881 It's true.
5400228 5402230 - Nice one.<br />- Thanks.
5410071 5411280 Come on, Neo.
5436264 5438808 Captain. You okay?
5438891 5441853 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5441936 5443062 Smith is killing him.
5443146 5444522 Where?
5452029 5454031 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5456617 5458744 After all, you are the one<br />who set me free...
5460037 5461038 again.
5463082 5464167 So, you, more than anyone,
5464250 5465877 understands why<br />I can't go back.
5468462 5470256 You should have<br />listened to me.
5472466 5474218 Now you'll never<br />see her again.
5487815 5488983 What was that?
5489066 5490443 That was Neo.
5492069 5493070 Mojo rising.
5501120 5502580 You all right?
5502663 5504165 Yeah.
5504248 5505448 It's gonna trigger a response.
5505500 5506709 I got multiple exits ready.
5506792 5508252 This is not over yet!
5508336 5511047 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5518095 5519513 We should go.
5519597 5520765 I can't.
5520848 5522767 I have to talk to her.
5522850 5525102 Neo, those Exiles<br />were older than you,
5525186 5526270 and we barely handled them.
5529857 5531400 You really wanna do this now?
5536822 5538032 I mean...
5542036 5543621 you look like shit.
5554882 5557426 Oh, my God. What?<br />What happened?
5557510 5558636 An accident.
5558719 5561055 Kush! Call a doctor.
5561138 5562682 It's fine.
5563599 5565726 I don't have a lot of time.
5565810 5567520 I wasn't sure<br />I'd see you again.
5567603 5570189 After we spoke, I realized...
5571065 5573109 my life wasn't a life.
5574568 5577321 At some point,<br />I think I gave up
5577405 5579657 searching for something real.
5585997 5587290 Wait.
5588749 5591335 Something happened.
5591419 5593796 I looked for you<br />at the coffee shop.
5595589 5597925 I began to wonder<br />if I imagined you.
5599093 5601637 And then last night<br />I had a dream.
5601721 5604515 In the dream, you were<br />surrounded by police,
5604598 5607143 then they started chasing us.
5607226 5610229 - Us?<br />- You were on my bike with me.
5612398 5613774 How did it end?
5615192 5616360 Not good.
5618904 5622325 I've had dreams<br />that weren't just dreams.
5622408 5624660 You mean a dream<br />that came true?
5632335 5634962 Finally, we can talk<br />like adults.
5636630 5639759 I hate lying. I do.<br />It exhausts me.
5641552 5643637 Tiff and I have been<br />waiting for you...
5643721 5644972 like, forever.
5652063 5653356 Deja vu, right?
5655149 5657318 Oh, no use.<br />You can't beat time.
5657401 5661113 This rewind is happening<br />faster than you can blink.
5665993 5667995 You gave me the idea.
5670831 5674126 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
5677171 5678297 "Bullet time."
5680132 5682093 I know. Kind of ironic,
5682176 5686097 using the power that<br />defined you to control you.
5686180 5688808 I kept such a close eye on you
5688891 5691435 and still you found a way out.
5691519 5693896 Clever monkey,<br />using that Modal.
5694855 5696023 Call me an optimist,
5696107 5698275 but this could<br />all be for the best.
5698359 5701195 The skin's not looking<br />too bad this time.
5701278 5703906 I know some of this will be<br />difficult for you to hear,
5703989 5705449 after everything<br />you went through.
5705533 5706909 All that pain and suffering,
5706992 5709829 only to learn the world<br />doesn't end when you do.
5711372 5712456 Surprise.
5718462 5719880 I was there when you died.
5722383 5723509 I said to myself,
5723592 5726804 "Here is the anomaly<br />of anomalies."
5726887 5729682 What an extraordinary<br />opportunity.
5731350 5732810 First, I had to convince<br />the Suits
5732893 5734311 to let me rebuild<br />the two of you.
5734395 5735980 Why her? Getting there.
5736063 5737857 And don't worry,<br />she can't hear me.
5737940 5741068 Resurrecting you both<br />was crazy expensive.
5741152 5742486 Like renovating a house.
5742570 5744822 Took twice as long,<br />cost twice as much.
5748909 5751370 I thought you'd be happy<br />to be alive again.
5752413 5753664 So wrong.
5755458 5759086 Did you know hope and despair<br />are nearly identical in code?
5761088 5763048 We worked for years,
5763132 5764759 trying to activate<br />your source code.
5764842 5768262 I was about to give up,<br />when I realized...
5771348 5772391 Trinity.
5772475 5774643 ...it was never just you.
5774727 5777813 Alone, neither of you<br />is of any particular value.
5779523 5780691 Like acids and bases,
5780774 5783152 you're dangerous<br />when mixed together.
5783235 5786197 Every sim<br />where you two bonded...
5786280 5788365 Let's just say<br />bad things happened.
5790409 5791869 Neo!
5796123 5799502 However, as long as I managed<br />to keep you close,
5799585 5801253 but not too close,
5801337 5804548 I discovered<br />something incredible.
5804632 5808135 Now, my predecessor<br />loved precision.
5808219 5811889 His Matrix was all fussy facts<br />and equations.
5811972 5813724 He hated the human mind.
5813807 5815226 So he never bothered<br />to realize
5815309 5816550 that you don't give a shit<br />about facts.
5816560 5817978 It's all about fiction.
5818062 5822733 The only world that matters<br />is the one in here.
5822817 5825819 And you people<br />believe the craziest shit.
5826362 5827613 Why?
5827696 5830282 What validates<br />and makes your fictions real?
5831242 5832326 Feelings.
5833494 5834954 Allow me.
5836330 5837998 Kush, here,<br />is one of my handlers.
5838082 5839416 They're everywhere.
5839500 5842086 Such a pain, cloning Agents<br />over a coppertop.
5842169 5844630 Far more effective<br />just to saturate a population.
5846549 5849426 And, bonus,<br />swarm mode is sick fun.
5861855 5864984 Ooh! Nicely done.
5866443 5869697 You ever wonder<br />why you have nightmares?
5869780 5872741 Why your own brain<br />tortures you?
5872825 5876328 It's actually us,<br />maximizing your output.
5876412 5877580 It works just like this.
5877663 5880291 Oh, no!<br />Can you stop the bullet?
5880374 5883294 If only you could move faster.
5883377 5885921 Here's the thing<br />about feelings.
5886005 5888299 They're so much easier<br />to control than facts.
5889258 5891135 Turns out, in my Matrix,
5891218 5894680 the worse we treat you,<br />the more we manipulate you,
5894763 5897224 the more energy you produce.
5897308 5899518 It's nuts.
5899602 5901186 I've been setting<br />productivity records
5901270 5902563 every year since I took over.
5902646 5905482 And, the best part,<br />zero resistance.
5905566 5906942 People stay in their pods,
5907026 5910112 happier than pigs in shit.
5910195 5911405 The key to it all?
5911488 5912823 You.
5912906 5914074 And her.
5914158 5916368 Quietly yearning<br />for what you don't have,
5916452 5918871 while dreading<br />losing what you do.
5918954 5920623 For 99.9% of your race,
5920706 5923375 that is the definition<br />of reality.
5923459 5926337 Desire and fear, baby.
5926420 5929381 Just give the people<br />what they want, right?
5938682 5941727 She's the only home<br />you have, Thomas.
5941810 5945105 Come home before<br />something terrible happens.
5955532 5956825 - Bugs!<br />- I hear him.
5963207 5964375 Trinity!
5964458 5966168 - You shouldn't call me that.<br />- I'm sorry.
5967670 5968921 I have to go.
5969004 5970172 But I'll be back.
5971298 5973592 Neo! Time to go.
5976095 5977805 - Sentinels?<br />- Worse.
5979264 5980349 General ordered me
5980432 5981433 to look after the ship.
5981517 5983394 So you shadowed us?
5983477 5985062 Check your long-range scans.
5985145 5987147 Squids are combing this area.
5987231 5988691 He's right.
5988774 5989942 You can stay here and die,
5990025 5992403 or come back<br />and face a court-martial.
5992486 5994488 And you call that a choice?
6001704 6003831 Sheperd should have<br />left you to the Squids.
6003914 6007292 I'm too damn old to sit<br />through some boring-ass trial.
6007376 6008585 Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
6008669 6010587 Do shut your mouth.
6010671 6012965 Do address me as General.
6013048 6017302 And do not rob<br />my ex-captain of her agency,
6017386 6019388 which she exercised<br />with her own
6019471 6022975 particular brand<br />of shortsighted stupidity.
6024226 6025310 Shortsighted?
6026979 6030941 You care more about<br />growing fruit than freeing minds.
6031024 6033527 We are not going<br />to have this argument again.
6033610 6035946 It's not an argument.<br />It's a fact.
6036029 6037239 You gave up on people.
6038699 6041034 I tell you<br />what I'm going to give up on
6041118 6042202 and it's you!
6044621 6046540 Sheperd, get her<br />out of my sight!
6046623 6047750 General...
6049668 6050753 Disarm!
6050836 6052463 Kujaku's a friend.
6059011 6060637 Hello, friend.
6063223 6064224 Okay.
6065559 6066769 Him?
6073692 6075360 General.
6075444 6076737 Thank you for seeing me.
6076820 6078614 I figured if there was anyone
6078697 6080991 who could make sense<br />of this mess,
6081074 6082868 it would be you.
6082951 6084077 Hello, Neo.
6084161 6085996 I know you.
6086079 6088081 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6091418 6092669 Why?
6092753 6094505 We met a long time ago.
6096215 6097299 Good morning.
6100093 6101094 Sati.
6101178 6103680 My father knew<br />we'd meet again,
6103764 6106725 though he would have wished<br />for happier circumstances.
6106809 6108602 His inadvertent role<br />in what happened to you
6108685 6110938 was the greatest regret<br />of his life.
6111021 6112898 I don't understand.
6114274 6115943 My father<br />was the chief engineer
6116026 6117277 at the Anomaleum.
6117361 6118737 The what?
6118821 6121907 My father designed<br />the resurrection pods
6121990 6123909 where Neo and Trinity<br />were imprisoned.
6125953 6127204 I'm sorry.
6127287 6128789 You knew what happened to him?
6128872 6132084 You knew that he and Trinity<br />both were alive...
6133085 6134378 and you didn't tell me?
6134461 6137381 There were times<br />I doubted my decision, Niobe.
6137464 6139091 But Io needed you.
6139174 6140509 This city needed to be built
6140592 6142636 for your people<br />as well as mine.
6143804 6145556 If I would have<br />told you everything,
6145639 6147808 you would have had a very<br />difficult choice to make.
6147891 6149476 My friends
6150811 6153313 let me make my own choices.
6153397 6155315 If it was a mistake,
6155399 6157484 you have my deepest apologies.
6159570 6160904 Why are you here now?
6160988 6163490 Neo's escape has<br />destabilized the Matrix.
6163574 6164825 The Anomaleum<br />draws its current
6164908 6166243 from Trinity alone now.
6166326 6168495 A fail-safe has been<br />triggered to reset
6168579 6170581 the Matrix back<br />to the previous version.
6170664 6172457 But The Analyst<br />halted the reset.
6172541 6173834 He's convinced the authorities
6173917 6175878 that you will soon<br />return voluntarily.
6177004 6178922 And why would he say that?
6179006 6182092 Because if I don't go back,<br />he'll kill Trinity.
6184845 6187222 Faced with returning<br />to your pod
6187306 6190100 or enduring<br />Trinity's death again.
6190183 6191476 What would you choose, Neo?
6192561 6193854 I'll go back.
6195564 6197774 Well, The Analyst<br />knows you well,
6197858 6200611 but that knowledge<br />has made him incautious.
6200694 6202362 After you escaped,
6202446 6205282 he should have accepted his<br />losses and devacuated Trinity.
6205365 6208243 But that would have prevented<br />this extraordinary opportunity
6208327 6210245 that now exists before us.
6210913 6213832 A few hours ago,
6213916 6217210 no one would have been able<br />to convince me
6217294 6221590 that I would be standing here,<br />trying to explain a mission
6221673 6223634 as crazy as this one.
6227429 6229056 What are you doing?
6229139 6230682 - Volunteering.<br />- Oh, no.
6230766 6235312 You are the one captain<br />that I am ordering to go.
6235395 6236980 Now you don't<br />have to order me, General,
6237064 6238732 'cause I'm volunteering.
6242110 6243654 I need two more.
6248158 6250994 Are you out of your minds?
6251078 6252955 You don't even know<br />what it is.
6253038 6255958 General, we know you.
6256041 6257250 If you say this is important,
6257334 6259378 none of us is<br />choosing to stay home.
6264758 6265842 Thank you.
6270931 6272933 Knuckle up, and good luck.
6302963 6304464 Trinity is held<br />in the Anomaleum,
6304548 6306299 which is in this<br />transmission tower.
6306383 6308635 The passages used<br />to rescue Neo are now sealed
6308719 6310929 and a legion of Sentinels<br />patrols the tower.
6311013 6313056 So, stealth will be paramount.
6313140 6314891 As long as we raise no alarms,
6314975 6317060 this first part of the mission<br />should be the easiest.
6317144 6318468 You mean<br />crossing the Fetus Fields,
6318478 6320230 sneaking across<br />an entire power plant,
6320313 6321732 climbing<br />a two-kilometer tower
6321815 6323650 guarded by thousands<br />of Sentinels?
6323734 6324901 That's the easy part?
6324985 6326653 Exactly so.
6326737 6329072 Because all we have to do<br />is convince someone
6329156 6330824 who does this every day
6330907 6332325 to take one of us along.
6355849 6357684 Fifty meters<br />below the Anomaleum
6357768 6359269 is a stratum<br />of amniotic filters.
6359352 6362773 Hidden along this edge<br />is a small hexagonal vent.
6362856 6366026 This vent feeds the air intake<br />into the corpuscular modifier,
6366109 6369196 which oxygenates<br />the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.
6369863 6371073 I get it.
6371156 6374034 The exomorph slinkies up<br />Neo's old umbilicus.
6375285 6376411 What could go wrong?
6423291 6424668 Once inside,
6424751 6426586 Morpheus will use<br />the System Operator
6426670 6429005 to open the devacuator line<br />and disengage the macerators.
6433093 6434678 In order to unplug<br />Trinity's body,
6434761 6436972 while her mind still remains<br />connected to the Matrix,
6437055 6438682 I'm gonna need<br />a second human brain
6438765 6439975 to implement the bypass.
6440058 6441685 And since Neo<br />must be with The Analyst,
6441768 6444938 the only available mind<br />that's a near-enough match
6445021 6446064 is yours.
6447607 6448525 Figures.
6466042 6467169 Thanks, Cybebe.
6475385 6477387 Does Trinity still have<br />to take the red pill?
6477470 6478889 Since Kujaku and I<br />are transferring
6478972 6480265 her consciousness<br />onto the ship,
6480348 6482017 it's not strictly necessary.
6482100 6486021 But what matters is that<br />this is her choice.
6486104 6489399 Extracting a confused<br />or an uncertain mind will,
6489482 6490859 in all probability, kill her.
6490942 6493486 But even if it is<br />what she wants,
6493570 6497240 won't The Analyst just order<br />the Sentinels to stop you?
6497324 6498825 He will.
6498909 6501369 But if my plan works,<br />it won't matter.
6501453 6502412 Why?
6502495 6504122 Because we'll already be gone.
6505832 6507751 Somebody thinks<br />this hard about a plan,
6507834 6509252 there has to be a reason why.
6511463 6512672 When my father realized
6512756 6515008 how the Anomaleum<br />was going to be used,
6515091 6518553 he covertly transferred<br />the designs to me.
6518637 6521139 The Analyst<br />discovered his betrayal
6521223 6523099 and had my parents purged.
6525727 6528730 I would have been murdered too<br />if it wasn't for Kujaku.
6531775 6535779 Not a day goes by<br />that I don't grieve them.
6535862 6538990 I've been praying for this day<br />for a very long time.
6547082 6548625 We're coming up on broadcast.
6551211 6555215 I thought you should know<br />that I'm here because of her.
6558718 6561096 All I ever wanted was to be<br />as fearless as Trinity.
6563306 6566726 But I saw how she reacted<br />in the garage, and I...
6566810 6569437 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6569521 6571064 What if we're too late?
6572857 6574567 What if she's not<br />Trinity anymore?
6579990 6582742 I never believed<br />I was The One.
6583618 6585036 But she did.
6586079 6587706 She believed in me.
6590375 6592585 It's my turn<br />to believe in her.
6617569 6619487 This is<br />where it gets tricky.
6630623 6633043 Have you ever done<br />an operation like this?
6633752 6634836 Not yet.
6656566 6657901 Here we go.
6675543 6677462 Welcome home.
6677545 6679923 All I want is to talk to her.
6680006 6681633 Do you mean Tiff?
6681716 6684469 Come back, and you can<br />talk to her as often as you like.
6684552 6685929 I mean, handsome Chad
6686012 6687472 may have something<br />to say about it.
6687555 6690850 If she tells me<br />this is what she wants,
6692060 6693228 you win.
6693311 6694437 Really?
6694521 6697273 But if she wants me,
6697357 6699192 then you'll let us go free.
6699275 6702028 And why would I do something<br />as stupid as that?
6702112 6704906 Right now, I'm on a ship full<br />of people who will unplug me
6704989 6707992 before they'll let you<br />take me back.
6708076 6710120 If you want this Matrix,
6710203 6711746 this is your only chance.
6711830 6714791 But how do I know<br />they won't unplug you anyway?
6714874 6718211 Same way I know you'll let us<br />walk out of here.
6743820 6745488 Okay.
6745572 6747073 I like tests.
6747949 6749742 We'll let Tiff decide.
6767093 6768261 That's it.
6769471 6771014 Bypass is ready.
6771097 6772807 Now what?
6772891 6774142 We wait.
6774225 6776186 Doesn't it seem crazy<br />to come all this way
6776269 6777854 and leave her here?
6777937 6780607 We must abide by her decision.
6780690 6782275 And if she says no,
6783109 6784569 what happens to Neo?
6784652 6785862 At this time,
6785945 6788781 the most important choice<br />of Neo's life
6788865 6790366 is not his to make.
6821397 6823191 I saw this in my dream.
6824651 6828112 If I was the Oracle,<br />maybe I could explain it.
6828780 6830365 The Oracle.
6830448 6832116 From your game?
6833993 6836246 It's not a game.
6838373 6839582 Oh, God.
6847048 6850468 After you left, I went home
6850552 6852262 and I played it.
6854639 6857100 I kept thinking,
6857183 6860520 why does this story<br />feel like a memory?
6867694 6869445 There's a part of me
6872031 6875243 that feels like I have been<br />waiting my whole life for you.
6878204 6880456 And that part is like,
6880540 6884252 "What the hell<br />took you so long?"
6884335 6886379 I don't have an easy answer.
6888548 6890717 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6892176 6894053 Afraid of what might happen.
6895555 6898558 Afraid of hurting<br />the only person I ever loved.
6900268 6903813 I wish I was<br />who you think I am.
6905189 6906774 But look at me.
6908067 6910236 I can't be her.
6910320 6912447 - Mom!<br />- Mom! Come on.
6912530 6913781 - Mom!<br />- It's Callie.
6913865 6914866 Is this real?
6914949 6916117 You have to come with us.
6916200 6917577 Come on,<br />we gotta go.
6917660 6919235 Tiff, hey. Don't know<br />what's going on here,
6919245 6920580 but I'm glad we found you.
6920663 6922030 - She got hit by a car!<br />- I know, it's crazy.
6922040 6923166 She was chasing after you.
6923249 6924657 They're casting her arm.<br />We gotta go.
6924667 6926044 Doctor said<br />she's gonna be fine.
6926127 6927920 You have to come<br />with us to the hospital.
6928004 6929088 It's too late.
6929172 6930381 I understand.
6930465 6932300 - Tiff, come on, let's go.<br />- Come on.
6938806 6939891 What's happening?
6941976 6943102 Neo was wrong.
6976469 6977553 Tiffany.
6981140 6983685 Tiffany, you have<br />to come with us.
6985311 6986688 Tiffany!
6988981 6992694 I wish you would<br />fucking stop calling me that.
6992777 6994320 I hate that name.
6995822 6997365 My name is Trinity
6997448 6999826 and you better<br />take your hands off of me.
7011003 7012004 Neo!
7012505 7013506 Trinity!
7014674 7015717 Oh, shit.
7017009 7018344 Get her out. Get her out!
7026978 7030273 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7030356 7033025 I own that mistake.<br />Shouldn't have pressed.
7033109 7036112 Women used to be<br />so easy to control.
7036195 7040742 You know there's no way<br />I can let you two go free.
7044162 7045621 Cannot happen.
7048791 7051627 So, I guess it's deja vu<br />all over again.
7052754 7054547 She dies
7054630 7056007 and it's all your fault.
7057550 7060136 Lies, lies and more lies.
7060887 7062096 Smith?
7062180 7063306 What has the world come to
7063389 7064630 when you can't even<br />trust a program?
7064640 7067977 How...
7068060 7070813 Tom and I have more in common<br />than you know.
7070897 7073941 Once he got out,<br />let's just say,
7074776 7076569 I was free to be me.
7084243 7086996 - Yeah!<br />- Trinity?
7135378 7136546 You ready?
7136629 7137922 Yeah.
7180006 7181465 Oh, no.
7182842 7185219 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7202194 7203195 No.
7209035 7210536 Stop them.
7236187 7237688 You think this is over?
7237772 7239774 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7248741 7251077 Here, our unexpected<br />alliance ends.
7252745 7255373 You know the difference<br />between us, Tom?
7255456 7257333 Anyone could have been you.
7257416 7259460 Whereas I've always<br />been anyone.
7264840 7266342 What just happened?
7266425 7267593 What?
7269595 7272181 Oh, no! Move! Move!
7272264 7273307 Get the hell out of there!
7277186 7279146 - How bad?<br />- Like, all the bad.
7280439 7281899 Yeah, this is bad.
7283275 7284902 I don't suppose<br />you can still fly?
7295287 7296998 Yeah, that's not happening.
7322732 7323983 Neo! Get on.
7332658 7334452 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7334535 7336579 Everyone else,<br />we stay with them!
7353637 7356182 - How is she?<br />- Life signs are good.
7360019 7361479 Her signal's strong, Captain.
7370362 7372406 Well done, Captain.
7374784 7376660 All we need is a miracle.
7404730 7405773 I hate bots.
7412071 7413906 - Get us out of here!<br />- I'm trying!
7413989 7415991 The lockdown is tracking.<br />Swarm is everywhere.
7416075 7417275 Never seen anything like this.
7463122 7465291 Seq, what is that?
7470296 7471422 What's wrong?
7473132 7474633 What are you...
7482183 7484226 He's turning bots into bombs.
7516675 7517885 Shit!
7517968 7518969 Lexy?
7533359 7534568 Sheperd's in trouble.
7537655 7539448 Jack me in.
7539531 7541575 I can get you in. I don't<br />know if I can get you out.
7547539 7549250 No!
7562596 7563722 What are they doing?
7567768 7569436 Herding them into a kill zone.
7602511 7603846 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7603929 7606181 Hang on, Lex.
7610394 7612229 Lexy!
7654480 7655647 There they are!
7682091 7683258 Morpheus!
7687137 7688847 Lex.
7688931 7690808 - Bugsy.<br />- Hell yeah!
7691767 7693394 Seq, where's Neo?
7693477 7695104 It's bad. They're pinned.
7695187 7696271 Heading to a roof.
7765549 7766800 Nodal fibrillation<br />is critical.
7766884 7768302 She'll die<br />if we don't extract.
7809301 7811929 It's so beautiful.
7827236 7828946 I remember this.
7831031 7833242 I remember us.
7851343 7853345 My dream ended here.
7864231 7865816 We can't go back.
7867943 7869027 We won't.
7888297 7889673 Can they make the jump?
7920746 7922372 I'm not doing this.
7922456 7923832 Are you doing this?
7947939 7949024 Bye.
8030063 8031648 How dramatic.
8032482 8033775 "Tiffany"?
8033859 8036820 It was a private joke.
8036903 8038447 An amusement, that's all.
8038530 8040866 An amusement? Hmm.
8042617 8044786 Whoa.
8044870 8046288 Kind of like that?
8050542 8053295 Okay. Ow.
8053378 8054838 If you hated the name so much,
8054921 8057090 why did you heel like<br />a good little bitch so long?
8060218 8062471 Yeah. Definitely asked<br />for that.
8067768 8069728 Can't you control her?
8075567 8077277 That was for using children.
8082157 8083658 We have a few questions.
8083742 8085577 You tried to activate<br />the fail-safe.
8085660 8086995 The Suits tried.
8087078 8089372 Obviously, without control<br />of your source code,
8089456 8090832 I knew that was impossible.
8090916 8093126 So, why haven't<br />the Suits purged you?
8094002 8096671 Because I know the system.
8096755 8099174 I know human beings.
8099257 8101426 And I know you.
8103845 8106389 Right now, you're feeling good<br />about what you've done.
8106473 8108892 You should.<br />It was a victory. Bravo.
8109726 8111061 Now what?
8111144 8113772 You've come here to negotiate<br />some kind of deal?
8113855 8115440 You think you hold<br />all the cards,
8115524 8117943 because you can do<br />whatever you want in this world.
8118026 8120362 I say, go for it.
8120445 8123031 Remake it.<br />Knock yourselves out.
8123114 8125158 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8125242 8126409 But here's the thing.
8126493 8129538 The sheeple aren't<br />going anywhere.
8129621 8130831 They like my world.
8130914 8133834 They don't want<br />this sentimentality.
8133917 8135836 They don't want<br />freedom or empowerment.
8135919 8138338 They want to be controlled.
8138421 8140382 They crave<br />the comfort of certainty.
8140465 8143218 And that means you two,<br />back in your pods,
8143301 8146847 unconscious and alone,<br />just like them.
8151101 8153812 We're not here<br />to negotiate anything.
8153895 8156147 We were on our way<br />to remake your world.
8156231 8157774 Change a few things.
8157858 8159067 I kind of like
8159150 8160559 the "paint the sky<br />with rainbows" idea.
8160569 8162487 Just remind people<br />what a free mind can do.
8162571 8164072 I forgot. It's easy to forget.
8164155 8166575 - He makes it easy.<br />- That, he does.
8166658 8168869 Something he should<br />think about.
8169870 8171079 Before we got started,
8171162 8173999 we decided to stop by<br />to say thank you.
8174082 8177168 You gave us something<br />we never thought we could have.
8177252 8178628 And what is that?
8179504 8181298 Another chance.
8844544 8847338 Face reality, people.<br />Movies are dead.
8847421 8849340 Games are dead.
8849423 8851175 Narrative? Dead.
8851259 8853219 Media is nothing<br />but neuro-trigger response
8853302 8854512 and viral conditioning.
8854595 8856097 Wait, what are you two<br />talking about?
8858349 8860184 Cat videos.
8860268 8864021 What we need is<br />a series of videos
8864105 8866440 that we call "The Catrix."
