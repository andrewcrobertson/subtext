47914 49349 [device beeping]
49416 51151 [phone line ringing]
56289 57957 -[woman] Seq, I'm in. -[Seq] Captain.
58024 59292 [woman] You were right.
59359 60727 The skylight was a window pane.
60794 62395 [Seq] I've got serious interference.
62462 63830 [woman] Weird. It's some kind of Modal.
63897 65598 [Seq] Looks like old code.
65665 67200 [woman] It feels really familiar.
67267 68902 [Seq] Drop a pin. I'll signal for backup.
68968 70703 -[woman] I'm gonna check it out. -[Seq] Bugs?
70770 72038 If the general finds out we've been fishing...
72105 73640 [Bugs] A quick peek can't hurt.
73706 75208 -[static] -[Seq] Did you hear that?
75275 76509 Shit. I think our signal was traced.
76576 78778 Bugs, this feels like a trap.
78845 80046 Bugs!
80113 81448 [suspenseful music playing]
119853 122355 [SWAT officer] Freeze! Do not move!
122422 123456 We will shoot!
123523 126960 Very slowly, raise your hands.
127026 128561 [suspenseful music playing]
140807 142442 [lieutenant] Here we go.
148181 149582 Hey, where are you going?
149649 151084 You were warned, Lieutenant.
151151 153419 I think we can handle one little girl.
156823 157757 You're wasting your time!
157824 160160 My men are bringing her down now.
160226 161461 No, Lieutenant,
162428 164531 your men are already dead.
172472 173673 [gasps slowly]
175008 176276 Seq, you with me?
176342 177677 This old code keeps crashing.
177744 179212 Your projection's breaking up. Switch to audio.
179279 180513 [Seq] Bugs, this is a direct violation
180580 181915 of the general's protocols.
181981 183383 I know, I know.
183449 185251 But something is happening here.
185985 187787 Something important.
187854 188988 [Bugs] Oh, fuck.
189055 190456 We know what happens next.
190523 192425 She kicks their ass.
196062 197697 [all grunting]
210977 212011 [groans]
214914 216249 Now she makes a call.
216316 217617 [woman] The line was traced.
217684 220019 -And then... -Then she runs for her life.
220086 221321 [woman] Are there any agents?
221387 222855 We know this story.
224357 225992 This is how it all began.
226793 228494 God damn it.
228561 230063 This is where he began.
230129 233499 You're thinking this Modal is a loop? Or a treadmill?
233566 237070 Some sort of sequencer evolving a program to do what?
237136 238438 I don't know.
239439 241074 But I'm going to find out.
241140 242442 All right.
244143 245545 [dramatic music playing]
252719 253720 [grunts]
253786 254821 [panting]
268001 269002 [woman grunts]
270336 272839 [woman groaning]
272905 275375 So deja vu and yet it's obviously all wrong.
275441 277477 Why use old code to mirror something new?
277543 279245 I don't know.
279312 280713 [all grunting]
291124 292592 [panting]
292659 294027 If that's supposed to be Trinity,
294093 295695 that's not what happens.
297597 299565 Maybe this isn't the story we think it is.
299632 301968 Bugs, you have to get out of here.
302035 304470 -It's gotta be a trap. -[helicopter whirring]
305838 306839 Shit.
309175 310743 [ominous music playing]
311878 312879 [Bugs grunting]
317183 318384 [Bugs growls]
322288 323623 [both grunting]
328194 330029 [Bugs screaming]
330096 331431 [agent screaming]
331497 332732 [both grunting]
344444 345912 [Bugs] Uh...
345978 347780 You all carry on.
347847 348848 As you were.
351884 353486 I'm just gonna...
354253 356022 see myself out.
356089 357090 Kill her.
358791 359792 [grunts]
367200 368401 [yells]
381247 382615 [sirens approaching]
384050 385051 [brakes screech]
390156 391224 [gasps]
391290 393059 [exclaims] Oh, Seq!
394694 395995 [tires screech]
400166 401167 [brakes screech]
412044 413946 [panting]
415014 416015 [gun cocks]
447013 448448 [Bugs straining]
448514 449949 [dramatic music builds]
460760 462094 -Why did you save me? -You first.
462161 464030 Who are you? Where did you come from?
464096 465565 Okay.
465631 467433 My name is Bugs.
467500 469769 As in "Bunny."
469836 471737 And tech that listens.
472672 474774 Do you know this is a Modal?
475808 477009 What's a Modal?
477076 479579 It's a simulation used to evolve programs.
483115 485184 Do you understand that you are...
486152 487687 digital sentience?
487753 489522 I know what I am.
489589 490890 Just like I know my job
490957 493092 is to hunt down and destroy synthients.
493159 494527 Like you.
498498 500099 And yet...
501734 503202 Here we are.
503269 504770 Here we are.
506105 508574 The other agents don't know about this room?
510376 511611 How'd you find it?
511677 514213 No one was ever in the key shop,
514280 515581 so I started looking.
516616 518784 More you looked, the more you found.
519652 521287 Story of my life.
528394 529595 What?
531597 533199 I feel like I know this room.
541741 544243 Holy shit.
546612 548147 This is his apartment.
548214 549348 [gasps]
549415 551517 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
551584 553553 I searched everywhere. He doesn't exist.
553619 555821 He stopped being Thomas a long time ago,
555888 558257 but maybe you know him by his real name.
559058 560126 Neo.
561527 562895 You do.
563963 565631 Oh, okay.
566165 567333 Uh...
567400 570136 I can't believe this, after all these years.
570202 573973 You see, most people think that Neo is dead.
575308 576776 But I know he's not.
577610 579345 Because I've seen him.
581547 583349 Where?
583416 586085 It's not something I can explain easily, but...
590623 593659 But the moment he looked at me,
593726 595361 I felt something...
598698 600399 unlock my mind.
603035 604103 Okay.
606272 608307 Something like that happened to me.
613112 614981 I saw this pattern...
616282 617750 and it was everywhere.
619218 621654 We can't see it, but we're all trapped inside
621721 624156 these strange, repeating loops.
624223 627660 Somehow I saw it in the mirror.
627727 630396 Just a flicker, but it was like you said.
635868 638371 And suddenly I understood.
638437 640940 This is not the real world.
643309 646779 [agent] For the first time, I felt real purpose.
647346 649348 I knew who I was
649415 651283 and what I had to do.
651817 653352 Who are you?
654687 656389 What do you have to do?
659358 660793 I am...
661460 662928 Morpheus.
663896 666265 And I have to find Neo.
667433 670336 [Bugs gasping]
670403 671871 Morpheus.
674674 676375 Okay. Okay.
676442 677543 Oh, my God!
677610 678944 I have to get you out of here.
679011 681447 I need to figure out who built this Modal.
681514 683115 Okay, come with me.
683182 685351 You have to be ready to leave. You have to be really ready.
685418 686752 And if you're not,
686819 687853 if you think that this is where you belong...
691123 692558 You call this a choice?
692625 694193 Oh, honestly, when somebody offered me these things,
694260 695861 I went off on binary conceptions of the world
695928 697396 and said there was no way I was swallowing
697463 699365 some symbolic reduction of my life.
699432 700866 And the woman with the pills laughed
700933 702201 'cause I was missing the point.
702268 703769 What point?
703836 706772 The choice is an illusion.
706839 709108 You already know what you have to do.
715715 716982 Truth.
723556 724623 Okay.
724690 725925 There's an old building
725991 727560 with a skylight and lots of stairs.
727626 728894 The Lafayette.
728961 730463 One of the four back doors leads there.
731363 732331 [Morpheus] Oh.
732398 733933 -Don't fight it. -Whoa, what's happening?
733999 735167 Keep breathing.
735234 736669 Extraction works pretty much the same
736736 738804 for humans and programs.
741474 742475 Ouch.
742541 743776 Ah.
744910 746345 Okay.
748848 750249 -Hey. -Hey.
750316 752118 I've never worn different glasses before.
752184 754987 Yeah, looks good. Which door?
755054 756989 -It's gotta be... -Okay.
761861 763629 Agent White.
763696 764830 Agent Smith?
764897 766298 [laughs]
767433 768534 [Bugs grunts]
770669 772171 -[Bugs] Go! -[grunts]
776642 778043 [men grunting]
779211 780946 Seq! Can you hear me?
781013 782281 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
782348 783682 Can you get us to the window pane?
783749 785851 Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!
788587 790322 [Morpheus exclaims, grunts]
795861 798197 That window! Go hard!
807039 808941 [both screaming]
814513 816315 [screaming fades]
825658 827960 [keyboard clacking]
839338 841340 [fast-paced music playing on speakers]
844310 846946 -[computer buzzing] -What the...
853018 855054 What the hell?
855120 857423 [suspenseful music playing]
871871 873205 Something wrong?
873272 876075 Uh... Just a little crash.
876141 878477 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
878544 882348 What a beautiful day to be alive. Am I right?
882414 884516 -Problemo? -He lost something.
885885 887219 Is this old Matrix code?
889088 890623 A little Modal experiment.
890689 893826 -For Binary? -[cell phone chimes]
893893 896528 -I need a coffee. -Coffee. Yes, stat!
896595 897663 I'm buying.
900633 902468 [man] I'm not trying to blow smoke up your ass,
902534 907039 but the first time I played the trilogy, I was shook.
907106 909675 The paradox between free will and destiny.
909742 910910 Are we all just algorithms
910976 912144 doing what we're supposed to do
912211 913846 or can we escape our programming?
913913 918017 Genius, inside the context of the game, BT dubs.
918083 920185 Hey, did I tell you it took over my life?
920252 922988 Yeah. I failed the seventh grade. [chuckles]
923055 925190 Your game almost ruined me.
925257 927693 -So you've said. -Yet here we are.
927760 930729 -[cups clink] -You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
930796 931997 is it free will
933032 934700 or destiny?
939438 941407 Oh, yeah.
941473 943409 There she is.
943475 945044 Total f-ing MILF.
945811 947947 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
948013 950182 I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.
950249 951517 Maybe you should go.
951583 954720 No, please. I... I promise, best self.
954787 956155 Best self.
959892 961293 Sure.
962061 963529 You ever talk to her?
965664 966966 Tell you what.
967032 971570 For all you've done for me, let me do this for you.
971637 974306 Jude, no. Stop.
974373 976041 -Excuse me. Excuse me. -Thanks.
976108 977576 Hi. Um...
977643 979211 I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.
979278 981113 I'm Jude Gallagher.
981180 983749 I work for a game company called Deus Machina.
983816 985117 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
985184 988087 Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.
988153 989955 -Mom loved Audrey Hepburn. -Jude.
990022 994093 Oh, and this is my very good friend, Thomas Anderson.
994159 996028 He is a bona fide famous person
996095 997496 and considered by most to be
997563 999665 the greatest game designer of our generation.
999732 1000933 I'm sorry about this.
1001000 1002201 -Jude... -[softly] Just talk to her.
1002267 1004737 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me "Tiff."
1005637 1006805 Hi.
1013979 1015247 Have we met?
1016682 1018650 Uh, we both come here.
1018717 1020285 -Can I have your morning bun? -[boy] Hey!
1020352 1021820 Are you trying to ball my mom or what?
1021887 1023122 -Brandon! -[chuckles]
1023188 1025124 [boy 2] Can I have one bite?
1025190 1028127 Babe! What's going on? We're gonna be late.
1028193 1030162 This is my husband, Chad.
1030229 1032164 -Nice to meet you. -Hey.
1033599 1035768 Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.
1035834 1037936 Right. Sorry. [chuckles]
1038003 1039638 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1043375 1045244 [soft music playing]
1063929 1064997 What?
1065064 1067132 [keyboard clacking]
1068200 1069468 [ominous music playing]
1072371 1074773 Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.
1080712 1083782 "Billions of people just living out their lives...
1084983 1086819 oblivious."
1088854 1091156 I always loved that line.
1091223 1092724 You wrote that one, yeah?
1095360 1097663 Every time I stand here,
1097729 1100999 I mean, O-M-G.
1101066 1103202 It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.
1104136 1105571 -Right? -[chuckles softly]
1107272 1108674 Yeah.
1109508 1110709 Sure.
1110776 1112611 Have a seat.
1114213 1115581 [man sighs]
1115647 1116782 Smoke?
1118050 1119251 I thought you quit.
1120018 1122387 I quit calling it a habit.
1122454 1124456 Now it's just a guilty pleasure.
1126525 1130162 Oh. Maybe I can make this easy for you.
1130229 1132164 I know Binary is over budget.
1132231 1134733 This is not about Binary, Tom. It's bigger than that.
1134800 1135968 This is about our future,
1136034 1139071 which is a sticky subject, given our past.
1139138 1140472 What do you mean?
1141406 1143041 How's the therapy?
1143108 1144543 Good.
1145110 1146678 Any...
1147679 1148914 episodes?
1150749 1151817 No.
1152351 1154353 That's terrific.
1155921 1159458 Look, Tom, I know we've always had our differences.
1159525 1161393 What did you say about our first meeting?
1161460 1164763 We had all the chemistry of an FBI interrogation.
1164830 1165831 [muffled yell]
1166231 1167299 [scoffs]
1167366 1168834 But look at this place.
1169935 1171370 We did this.
1172671 1173839 Together.
1175140 1176708 Yeah.
1176775 1178677 Now what?
1178744 1182447 Things have changed. The market's tough.
1182514 1184683 I'm sure you can understand why our beloved
1184750 1186285 parent company, Warner Bros.,
1186351 1188754 has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy.
1188820 1190122 What?
1190189 1192291 They informed me they're gonna do it with or without us.
1192357 1194092 I thought they couldn't do that.
1194159 1195227 [exhales]
1195294 1196828 Oh, they can.
1196895 1198063 And they made it clear
1198130 1200299 they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.
1200365 1202267 Really?
1202334 1206238 I know you said the story was over for you,
1206305 1208507 but that's the thing about stories.
1210242 1212077 They never really end, do they?
1212144 1214746 We're still telling the same stories we've always told,
1214813 1219284 just with different names, different faces
1220719 1223855 and I have to say I'm kind of excited.
1226592 1227793 After all these years,
1227859 1230996 to be going back to where it all started.
1231063 1233465 Back to The Matrix.
1234433 1236268 I've spoken to Marketing...
1236335 1240539 -[sinister music playing] -[distorted voice]
1242174 1243742 [in normal voice] Tom?
1243809 1245310 Yeah.
1245377 1246378 Are you all right?
1246445 1247946 [exhales nervously]
1248814 1249915 Yeah.
1254820 1257022 [analyst] What were you feeling at that point?
1260158 1261927 What was I feeling?
1265097 1269968 I felt either I'm having a mental breakdown again
1270035 1274306 or I'm living inside a computer-generated reality
1274373 1275941 that has imprisoned me...
1276675 1277776 again.
1278377 1279745 [laughs]
1281546 1282848 [chuckles softly]
1288387 1289921 Not much of a choice.
1289988 1291290 No.
1291356 1292891 Maybe it's not as binary as that.
1292958 1296395 Maybe there are other ways to understand what happened.
1296862 1297863 Yeah.
1297929 1300265 Thomas, you are a suicide survivor
1300332 1303168 gifted with a powerful imagination.
1303235 1304903 Those facts have combined
1304970 1307572 to create dangerous fictions in your life.
1307639 1309241 Yesterday, you walked into a meeting
1309308 1310375 with your business partner
1310442 1311943 and he ambushed you,
1312010 1314513 demanding you make a game you said you would never make.
1314579 1317849 This attack effectively took away your voice.
1317916 1320686 His violence triggered you and your mind fought back.
1320752 1322721 You did to him what he was doing to you.
1324222 1325557 We've talked about the value
1325624 1329127 of adaptive anger in healing trauma.
1329194 1332564 Far from suggesting a repeat of your initial breakdown,
1332631 1333865 I believe this episode
1333932 1335834 demonstrates healthy self-protection.
1337235 1339604 And more importantly, I remember how hard
1339671 1342674 it was for you to share something like this.
1342741 1345577 Which tells me just how far we've come.
1346945 1348480 [chuckles softly]
1350615 1352884 Do you need a refill on your prescription?
1352951 1354720 [sighs]
1354786 1355921 Yeah.
1360926 1362127 [pills rattle]
1366665 1369101 [mysterious music playing]
1376074 1377409 [grunts softly]
1378543 1380712 First of all, I know I speak for everyone
1380779 1383048 when I say that I'm so, so excited
1383115 1385283 to be working on a game that was such a...
1385350 1387452 well, game changer.
1387519 1389187 Now, the packet in front of you
1389254 1391923 has our focus group research.
1391990 1393592 Inside, you'll find the breakdown
1393658 1396495 including keyword association with the brand.
1396561 1399664 The top two being "originality" and "fresh,"
1399731 1401733 which I think are great things to keep in mind
1401800 1404035 as you begin working on Matrix 4.
1405570 1407139 And who knows how many more?
1408740 1410075 [alarm buzzing, stops]
1415680 1417048 [singing indistinctly]
1422554 1426091 What made Matrix different? It effed with your head.
1426158 1427526 On point.
1427592 1429594 People want us up in their grey space,
1429661 1432631 switching their synaptic "WTF" light on.
1432697 1435066 ["White Rabbit" playing]
1438437 1439971 [man laughing]
1441873 1445076 What made Matrix different? It effed with your head.
1445143 1447145 People want us up in their grey space,
1447212 1448547 switching their synaptic
1448613 1451183 "What the hell is going on here?" light on.
1458123 1459524 [panting]
1459591 1461159 [shower running]
1461226 1465597 I didn't love the first one, like some of you.
1465664 1468033 And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance
1468099 1470569 for anything that requires a syllabus and a highlighter.
1470635 1472471 I like my games big, loud and dumb.
1472537 1474506 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1474573 1477175 Matrix means mayhem.
1477242 1479945 [grunting]
1481813 1484082 Mindless action is not on-brand.
1484149 1485417 [man] She's right.
1485484 1488620 Matrix is mind-porn. Philosophy in shiny...
1488687 1490422 -tight PVC. -Yeah.
1490489 1492524 Ideas are the new "sexy."
1494226 1496294 ["White Rabbit" continues playing]
1506571 1508106 Obviously The Matrix is about...
1508173 1510509 -...trans-politics. -Crypto-fascism.
1510575 1511576 It's a metaphor...
1511643 1513278 ...of capitalist exploitation.
1525824 1530228 This cannot be another reboot, retread, regurgitated...
1530295 1532297 Why not? Reboots sell.
1535400 1537402 We are so far down the wrong rabbit hole, here, people.
1537469 1541273 You say Matrix to anyone... You say Matrix...
1541339 1544309 [echoing] Matrix... Matrix... Matrix...
1544376 1546244 ...this is what they see. [mimics explosion]
1546311 1548680 -[guns firing] -[bullets whizzing]
1551616 1552951 [clicks tongue]
1553018 1555353 Allow me to sum up our goal in a single word.
1555420 1557689 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1558256 1559257 That's two words.
1563194 1566598 We need a new "bullet time." [echoing]
1567599 1568934 [laughs maniacally]
1569000 1572904 We need to revolutionize gaming again.
1572971 1576908 Revolutionize gaming again! [echoing]
1579578 1581947 ["White Rabbit" continues]
1602734 1604436 [barista] Afternoon, Tiff.
1604502 1605770 The ushe?
1605837 1607939 You know what, Skroce? I'm going wild.
1608006 1610575 I'll have a cortado today.
1610642 1613278 Fly that freak flag.
1613345 1615113 Mind if I get that?
1615180 1616181 Oh, hi.
1617182 1619117 Hi.
1619184 1621720 [Tiffany] I remember wanting a family,
1621786 1623088 but was that because
1623154 1625924 that's what women are supposed to want?
1625991 1627792 How do you know if you want something yourself
1627859 1630962 or if your upbringing programmed you to want it?
1631029 1632030 Mmm.
1632964 1634933 I pay my analyst a lot of money
1635000 1637569 to answer such questions for me.
1637636 1638870 Smart.
1638937 1640171 I should get more therapy
1640238 1642741 but honestly, I'm too goddamn tired.
1642807 1644709 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1646044 1648446 No. Never had kids.
1648513 1651182 Oh, right, I knew that.
1651249 1653885 -Sorry. I googled you. -[chuckles]
1655620 1658390 So, what's it like being a world-famous game designer?
1658456 1660859 -Must be amazing. -Uh...
1660925 1662527 A lot of hours.
1662594 1664629 Sometimes it is amazing.
1664696 1666264 Most times...
1667465 1668833 I don't know.
1668900 1671269 But you made The Matrix. Even I've heard of that.
1671336 1675140 Yeah. We kept some kids entertained.
1675206 1677409 -So, worth it? -[chuckles]
1683782 1686351 Can I ask something about your game?
1686418 1687752 Sure.
1687819 1690088 Did you base your main character on yourself?
1695093 1697062 There is a lot of me in him.
1697128 1699597 [indistinct shouting]
1699664 1702934 Maybe a little too much.
1704836 1706538 Can I ask you something else?
1706604 1707972 Please.
1709641 1711976 There's a woman in your game.
1713144 1714145 Trinity.
1715947 1718817 Which is a weird coincidence also, right?
1720285 1721352 God, yeah.
1722687 1724055 I like her.
1725090 1727525 -I like Trinity. -Ah.
1727592 1728893 And I dig her Ducati.
1728960 1731996 Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.
1733498 1735133 [engine revs]
1735200 1737802 My friend Kush and I actually build them.
1737869 1739070 Really?
1739137 1742540 You have your analyst, I have my bikes.
1742607 1747312 So, I was looking at images from your game. At Trinity.
1748947 1750482 Well, I showed Chad a scene,
1750548 1752851 and I was like, "So, what do you think?"
1753818 1756254 He didn't get it until I said,
1756321 1758389 "Don't you think she looks like me?"
1760125 1762026 You know what he did?
1763328 1764496 He laughed.
1769200 1772036 And I laughed too, like it was a joke.
1772103 1773872 How could it not be, right?
1775874 1777542 Made me so angry.
1779043 1781412 I hated myself for laughing.
1783047 1786217 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1787485 1788653 Not too hard.
1788720 1791956 Maybe just hard enough to break his jaw off.
1792023 1793324 [chuckles]
1795260 1797028 And right now, you're probably regretting
1797095 1798830 sitting down with me.
1800732 1804702 This is the best thing I've done in a long time.
1804769 1807038 [chuckles]
1807105 1808973 -[cell phone ringing] -[gasps]
1809040 1810942 I have to take this.
1814479 1815547 Hi, this is Tiff.
1815613 1816681 Oh, God, no.
1816748 1818016 [gasps]
1818716 1820819 I'll be right there.
1820885 1823621 My, uh, youngest stuck a Lego up his nose.
1824556 1825957 Oh.
1827325 1828326 I gotta go.
1830528 1833164 I hope I see you again.
1845710 1851015 [alarm blaring]
1851082 1852083 [announcer on speaker] There has been a report
1852150 1853618 of an emergency.
1853685 1855854 Proceed calmly to the nearest exit
1855920 1857822 and leave the building immediately.
1857889 1859324 What's going on?
1859390 1861226 We probably just got swatted by some 14-year-old.
1861292 1862894 Yeah, someone pissed about the latest update.
1862961 1864429 Or they're just a dick.
1864495 1867165 Please move to the exits. Building's being evacuated.
1867232 1868633 [cell phone buzzes]
1882280 1885216 [suspenseful music playing]
1888386 1890255 [security guard] Sir, this way.
1895927 1897262 Jude?
1898696 1899931 Jude!
1906304 1908273 At last.
1909974 1911276 [chuckles] Ah.
1911342 1912911 I wasn't too sure about the callback,
1912977 1914846 but, you know, it was hard to resist.
1914913 1916147 What?
1916214 1917515 Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.
1917582 1920251 Lightning, thunder and theater.
1920318 1922153 At last.
1922220 1924555 All these years later, here's me,
1924622 1926925 strolling out of a toilet stall.
1926991 1928092 Tragedy or farce?
1928159 1929961 I know you.
1930028 1931930 Not every day you meet your maker.
1931996 1933164 This can't be happening.
1933231 1935033 Oh, most definitely is.
1935099 1937568 You can't be a character I coded.
1937635 1939637 100% natural.
1945143 1946511 [gasps softly]
1947011 1948279 How?
1948346 1950581 All the explanation you need.
1953751 1955453 Oh.
1955520 1956688 No.
1956754 1958489 No, no, no.
1958556 1960425 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, "no"?
1960491 1963161 You wanted this, you did this. This was your idea.
1963227 1967532 [hesitating] It was a test. An experiment.
1968800 1970134 An experiment?
1971469 1973404 You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,
1973471 1975039 left me to bang my head till
1975106 1977208 I nearly lost my shit searching for you
1977275 1978843 as an experiment.
1978910 1980979 -The exit's breaking down. -He hasn't taken the pill.
1981045 1982380 What? There's no time.
1982447 1984549 I know, I know. He's having a moment.
1984615 1987051 Does he know how hard it was to hack that mirror?
1987118 1989420 [tense music playing]
1989487 1991022 Still open.
1991089 1994525 This... This can't be real.
1994592 1996494 [SWAT officer] Target acquired. We got him.
2002667 2003968 [grunting]
2004035 2005336 This isn't happening.
2005403 2008039 It's in my mind. It's in my mind.
2008106 2009307 [SWAT officer 2] Hey, you! Stop! Hold it!
2011909 2013478 [all screaming]
2017048 2019050 [groaning]
2025223 2026824 This can't be happening.
2028793 2029961 -[gunshots] -[gasps]
2030028 2031729 [SWAT officer 3] Freeze! Don't move!
2034165 2035466 [gun firing]
2040705 2041806 Neo!
2047745 2050181 [tense music playing]
2052817 2054419 [gun firing]
2056754 2058256 Oh, my God!
2060124 2062126 [distorted gunfire]
2069100 2070435 [men groaning]
2072303 2073538 [grunting]
2079410 2080778 [tense music continues]
2092857 2094125 Neo!
2096260 2098830 [tense music builds]
2098896 2101199 [shouts] Mr. Anderson!
2101866 2103101 No!
2103167 2104368 It can't be.
2113044 2114879 I've missed you.
2121252 2122687 [cat meows]
2125456 2127391 [bell tinkling]
2130128 2131829 It's in my mind.
2132964 2134432 It's in my mind.
2140805 2142406 [cup clinking]
2142473 2144175 [analyst] Can you hear me, Thomas?
2145209 2148012 Follow my voice.
2148079 2151916 Feel the tips of your fingers. What are they touching?
2151983 2153417 [bell tinkling]
2153885 2155386 The bell.
2157855 2159323 Do you hear the bell?
2162627 2165696 Do you remember what happened? How you got here?
2167265 2168499 You must have walked.
2168566 2169800 I heard Deja Vu outside,
2169867 2171335 opened my door, and there you were.
2175039 2176474 [Thomas Anderson exhales]
2176541 2179410 You feel like you can talk about it?
2179477 2180845 When we started working together,
2180912 2182513 you had lost your capacity
2182580 2185082 to discern reality from fiction.
2185149 2188452 You came to me after trying to jump off a building.
2188519 2190821 You said you wanted to fly away.
2193090 2195793 [indistinct chatter]
2200064 2201532 [people shouting]
2204068 2206871 We have made a lot of progress since then,
2206938 2209373 but you seem particularly triggered right now.
2209440 2210875 Can you tell me how it started?
2212910 2214645 He texted me.
2215780 2217081 Who?
2217148 2218683 Morpheus.
2218749 2219817 Ah.
2221419 2222954 So, he's back.
2223020 2225289 It wasn't actually him.
2226324 2229560 It was a program I coded for a Modal.
2229627 2231929 And this "Modal," Morpheus,
2231996 2233898 came to help you escape
2233965 2237702 from a virtual reality called The Matrix.
2247745 2249680 Am I crazy?
2249747 2252283 We don't use that word in here.
2252350 2255386 What word should I use?
2255453 2258823 What word explains what is happening to me?
2258889 2260558 Can I see the texts?
2261325 2262893 [exhales]
2262960 2264562 They were erased.
2269734 2273137 If we got in my car and drove to your office,
2273204 2275072 what do you think we'd find there?
2275139 2276374 Nothing.
2279043 2281012 Because there was no attack.
2282213 2283848 No one was killed.
2284815 2286951 No one texted.
2287018 2288986 My mind made it all up.
2290454 2293124 Is that what I'm supposed to say?
2293190 2294725 Is that what you believe?
2295393 2297261 It felt real.
2297328 2299096 Of course.
2299163 2302099 It was your great ambition to make a game
2302166 2304568 that was indistinguishable from reality.
2304635 2306103 To achieve this goal,
2306170 2308773 you converted elements of your life into narrative.
2308839 2311108 Your sublimated anger toward your business partner
2311175 2313344 cast him as your nemesis.
2313411 2315012 A married woman named Tiffany
2315079 2318582 became the "Trinity" of a doomed romance.
2318649 2322720 Even your dislike of my cat made it into your Matrix.
2322787 2324555 There's nothing wrong with that.
2324622 2326257 It's what artists do.
2326324 2329560 But it becomes a problem when fantasies
2329627 2332029 endanger us or other people.
2334365 2336567 We don't want anyone to get hurt,
2336634 2338102 do we, Thomas?
2346110 2348412 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me "Tiff."
2348479 2350848 -Who are you? -My name is Trinity.
2350915 2352583 [Oracle] No one can tell you you're in love.
2352650 2355152 You just know it, through and through.
2355219 2357722 Balls to bones.
2357788 2359690 [Trinity whispers] You feel this?
2361325 2363027 I'm never letting go.
2363961 2365062 [yells]
2365963 2366964 [both grunting]
2370735 2372870 [Morpheus] You have to let it all go, Neo.
2372937 2375172 Free your mind.
2380644 2382747 [cell phone buzzing]
2382813 2384048 -[buzzing stops] -[sighs]
2385149 2386484 [pigeon cooing]
2393991 2395426 Huh.
2395493 2397628 Looks easy enough.
2402166 2403167 [exhales]
2404368 2407004 "Free my mind." Shit.
2408706 2410641 [suspenseful music playing]
2412143 2414211 Okay.
2414278 2415780 Free my mind.
2421852 2422853 [grunts]
2431962 2433597 I fly...
2434365 2436333 or I fall.
2436400 2437902 [suspenseful music builds]
2439270 2440471 [grunts]
2441605 2442973 [both grunting]
2444175 2445509 Who the hell are you?
2446243 2448212 You won't remember me,
2448279 2451649 but a long time ago, you changed my life
2451715 2454118 when you leapt off another roof.
2454185 2457188 Back then, I was just like any other coppertop,
2457254 2458856 pretending my life...
2458923 2463060 until I looked up and I saw you.
2463127 2465796 It was a different you, but I saw
2466464 2468299 the real you,
2468365 2470134 just a second before...
2471535 2472603 you leapt.
2472670 2473971 [people shouting]
2477408 2479210 And you never fell.
2484582 2486784 Are you the one that hacked my Modal?
2487251 2488319 Yeah.
2488385 2489620 [cell phone buzzing]
2489687 2491355 That'll be Jude.
2491422 2492790 He's not your friend.
2492857 2494325 He's a handle, a program used to control you.
2494391 2495459 He's on his way here,
2495526 2497294 and he's bringing Agents with him.
2498662 2500030 Jude.
2500097 2501565 Bro, I've been calling you all night.
2501632 2503300 We have a major problemo.
2504768 2506604 Are you alone?
2509173 2512009 That's kind of a sexy question, dude.
2512076 2514278 [Bugs] They don't look like typical Agents.
2514345 2515813 They use bots now, skinned as normal people,
2515880 2517047 which means they're everywhere
2517114 2519450 and you never know who to trust.
2519517 2521252 Why should I trust you?
2523287 2526490 Because if they open that door, we lose our hack.
2526557 2528292 I will be caught and killed
2528359 2529593 and you will be put right back
2529660 2530828 on that treadmill they designed for you,
2530895 2531996 just like they did the last time
2532062 2533297 you tried to leap your way out.
2534698 2537067 I know why you left your Modal open.
2537134 2539570 You needed someone else to free Morpheus.
2539637 2541772 And it's because of him that we were able to get to you.
2541839 2543741 I know these things the same way
2543807 2546443 that I knew one day I would find you.
2546510 2549246 And that when I did, you would be ready for this.
2553817 2555219 If you want the truth, Neo,
2556554 2558622 you're going to have to follow me.
2560057 2561058 Okay.
2564295 2566096 [dramatic music playing]
2578509 2580511 [upbeat music playing]
2580578 2583147 -Where are we? -Tokyo.
2583213 2585082 A moving portal makes it harder to track us.
2585149 2587718 -Seq is the best of them. -[Seq] Portal's clean.
2587785 2589286 Reading our shadows.
2590754 2593290 I don't remember this.
2593357 2595659 We don't have to run to phone booths anymore, either.
2595726 2597962 [upbeat music playing]
2605336 2606837 Door's on your right.
2608539 2609773 [door opens]
2620884 2623354 Set and setting, right?
2623420 2624688 Oh, no.
2624755 2626256 It's all about set
2627157 2628258 and setting.
2628325 2630628 After our first contact went so badly,
2630694 2632596 we thought elements from your past
2632663 2634031 might help ease you into the present.
2634098 2636900 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2636967 2638602 a little nostalgia.
2638669 2641005 This is footage from your game.
2648112 2650180 [Morpheus] Time is always against us,
2650948 2653117 etcetera, etcetera.
2654318 2655319 No one can be told
2655386 2658889 what the Matrix is, blah, blah, blah.
2661258 2663327 You gotta see it to believe it.
2666864 2668565 Time to fly.
2668632 2670067 [suspenseful music playing]
2670534 2672136 Wait.
2672202 2673303 If this is real,
2673370 2676140 if I haven't lost my mind, does that mean
2677741 2679209 this happened?
2679977 2682880 [soft music playing]
2687918 2689787 But if it did...
2693724 2695359 then we died.
2695426 2697227 Obviously not.
2697294 2698896 Why the Machines kept you alive
2698962 2701832 and why they went to such lengths to hide you
2701899 2703634 are questions we don't have answers to.
2703701 2705369 Hide me?
2705436 2709640 I've been at a company making a game called The Matrix.
2709707 2712376 Doesn't seem like they were trying to hide anything.
2712443 2714044 We've been tracking that company for years.
2714111 2716880 We screened every Thomas Anderson we found.
2716947 2718682 What we didn't understand
2718749 2721151 was that they could alter your DSI.
2721218 2723020 Pods generate your digital self-image
2723087 2725689 through a feedback system called Semblance.
2725756 2727591 This is how you look to yourself.
2727658 2731395 Somehow they were able to alter your DSI loop.
2731462 2733997 This is how everyone else sees you.
2734064 2736900 [suspenseful music playing]
2748045 2750180 Twenty years?
2751348 2754985 Why did it take 20 years to find me?
2755052 2756954 It took a lot longer than that.
2757020 2758989 It's been over 60 years since you and Trinity
2759056 2760924 flew to one of the Machine Cities.
2761492 2762559 What?
2762626 2764762 There's so much we don't know.
2764828 2766497 Like why you've barely aged,
2766563 2768932 or how many times they've altered your DSI.
2768999 2770234 [Morpheus] But based on what we do know,
2770300 2771802 it appears no one found you
2771869 2773537 because you didn't want to be found.
2773604 2776540 -That's not true. -[Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.
2776607 2777841 Maybe there's no foundation
2777908 2778976 to the rumors that you disappeared,
2779042 2780244 because you were working
2780310 2781745 with the Machines from the beginning.
2781812 2783013 Morpheus, stop.
2783080 2786183 All I'm saying is this is the moment
2786250 2788786 for you to show us what is real.
2788852 2791054 If you want out,
2791121 2792556 you'll take this pill.
2794057 2796527 But if you are where you belong,
2796593 2798729 you can go back to this.
2798796 2800097 Every day.
2800164 2804001 Over and over forever.
2807371 2808539 Fuck.
2810207 2814011 [dramatic music playing]
2818649 2819917 [Seq] Keep the loop tight.
2832196 2833297 [Bugs] Cybebe needs that tower pin.
2833363 2835432 I got a signal. It's faint.
2835499 2837000 It's definitely off-grid.
2843674 2846143 Captain. I'm tracking a whole lot of weird.
2846210 2847878 -What? -It's some kind of graft.
2853884 2855319 Thomas?
2856453 2858288 Oh, God.
2858789 2860557 Oh, no.
2861959 2864161 -We got company. -How'd they find us?
2865295 2868298 Thomas, none of this is real.
2868365 2872603 You are in the midst of a serious psychotic break.
2872669 2874671 -Lexy? -Almost there.
2874738 2876940 Thomas?
2877007 2879776 Thomas, please. This is not a game.
2879843 2881478 Feel my hand.
2881545 2882646 This is what is real.
2885682 2887551 Stay with me.
2887618 2889253 [Thomas Anderson] No. No.
2892089 2893156 [analyst, distorted] Stay with me.
2893223 2894958 [distorted grunts]
2895859 2897060 Neo!
2900631 2901632 Morpheus!
2903166 2904601 [Morpheus] Let's go, let's go!
2921251 2923620 [people screaming]
2929726 2931228 [woman screaming]
2935065 2937000 -Bots are being activated. -It's a swarm.

2939770 2941538 [yelling]
2950080 2951481 [woman screams]

2983013 2984715 [whimpers]
2991555 2993223 [shrieking]
2995692 2997361 I got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry!
2997427 2998428 Yes.
2999062 3000263 Come on!
3002132 3003333 Seq, where?
3005302 3007104 -That mirror. -What?
3007170 3008839 -We'll never fit. -You gotta fit,
3008905 3010340 'cause I don't have another way off this train.
3010407 3011475 -[groans] -[Morpheus] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3012509 3013977 No, no, no.
3014044 3015212 Think "perspective."
3015278 3017214 Closer you are, bigger it gets.
3020684 3022386 Okay, come on.
3023620 3024821 In you go.

3228058 3231294 [echoing] Welcome back to the real world.
3239736 3240804 Trinity.
3240870 3242138 -What's up, Doc? -[woman] His vital systems
3242205 3243540 have been meticulously maintained,
3243607 3245642 but it doesn't look good.
3248778 3250814 [EKG beeping]
3250880 3253450 -We're losing him. -Cold boot could shock him.
3253917 3255051 Do it.
3255118 3256653 [computer buzzing rapidly]
3258221 3259422 [groans]
3259956 3260957 [exhales]
3268064 3269633 I remember this.
3272202 3273803 The Construct.
3274504 3277173 In between everything
3277240 3279376 and nothing.
3279442 3281311 Welcome to the Crib.
3282746 3284814 I've been chilling here in the ship network...
3288184 3289819 learning all about you.
3292522 3293923 [TV static]
3294391 3295692 And me.
3299462 3303199 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3303266 3306936 Are memories turned into fiction any less real?
3310040 3313410 Is reality based in memory nothing but fiction?
3313476 3316613 As to my role in all this, my best guess
3316680 3318014 is that you wrote me
3318081 3320216 as an algorithmic reflection of two forces
3320283 3322686 that helped you become you,
3322752 3326289 Morpheus and Agent Smith.
3326356 3327557 A combo pack
3327624 3330093 of counterprogramming that was...
3330160 3331361 [inhales]
3332896 3336733 Let's just say, more than a little bit crazy-making.
3336800 3339803 But it worked because here we are.
3340704 3342405 Now, for the bad news.
3342472 3344708 Your brain is hooked on this shit
3344774 3347544 the Matrix has been force-feeding you for years.
3347610 3349446 Hooked bad.
3349512 3350947 You're going through major withdrawals.
3351014 3354351 Docbots are giving you crap odds for surviving.
3354417 3356686 But, see, they don't know you like I do.
3359456 3361758 I know exactly what you need.
3363426 3365395 [lively music playing]
3383513 3385215 You gotta be kidding.
3385281 3386516 Uh-uh.
3387317 3389152 No joke.
3389219 3393390 Could be this is the first day of the rest of your life.
3393456 3395458 But if you want it...
3396526 3397761 [water splashing]
3398828 3400430 you gotta fight for it.
3401398 3404501 No. I'm done fighting.
3405335 3406536 Are you?

3452382 3455118 Oh, yeah. They taught you good.
3458087 3460390 [Neo grunting]
3460457 3463827 Made you believe their world was all you deserved.
3463893 3465862 But some part of you knew that was a lie.
3465929 3468765 Some part of you remembered what was real.
3471401 3472702 You don't know me.
3473203 3474270 No?
3474337 3475572 [both grunting]

3518715 3520483 the only thing that still matters to you.
3520550 3523786 I know it's why you're here, why you're still fighting
3523853 3525455 and why you will never give up.

3556819 3558221 if you want to see Trinity again.
3558288 3560023 [Neo groaning]
3562992 3564627 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3567030 3569632 -Holy shit. -Fight for her!

3585281 3586282 [gasps]
3595592 3596793 [sighs]
3621751 3623653 -Hey. -Hey.
3625421 3626990 Mind if I...
3639969 3641738 How are you doing?
3643072 3645274 If this plug is actually real,
3647143 3649712 that means they took my life...
3650580 3652015 [scoffs]
3652081 3654450 and turned it into a video game.
3657620 3659255 How am I doing?
3660256 3662158 I don't know.
3662225 3664460 I don't even know how to know.
3665595 3667130 That's it, isn't it?
3668631 3670900 If we don't know what's real...
3672802 3674070 we can't resist.
3676873 3678441 They took your story,
3678508 3680043 something that meant
3680977 3683312 so much to people like me,
3684947 3687750 and turned it into something trivial.
3689452 3691220 That's what the Matrix does.
3691954 3694257 It weaponizes every idea.
3694891 3696392 Every dream.
3697927 3699829 Everything that's important to us.
3702198 3704534 Where better to bury truth than inside something
3704600 3707637 as ordinary as a video game?
3707704 3709639 That sounds like the Oracle.
3709706 3710940 [Bugs chuckles]
3711007 3712975 Heard so much about her.
3715712 3717246 She was gone before I was free.
3718781 3720249 Gone?
3720316 3723219 When this new version of the Matrix was uploaded,
3724687 3726255 there was a purge.
3728891 3731060 [sighs]
3731127 3734964 They promised peace and they gave us purge.
3736332 3737734 No.
3737800 3739535 No, there was peace.
3741037 3746075 You made it possible, and it changed everything.
3746142 3749779 Doesn't feel like it changed anything.
3749846 3752982 The Matrix is the same or worse.
3753049 3755318 And I'm back where I started.
3758020 3760490 It feels like everything I did,
3761557 3763126 everything we did...
3766996 3768197 [both grunt]
3769031 3771300 ...like none of it mattered.
3773536 3775204 All of it mattered.
3776839 3778407 I can show you.
3788985 3790820 This is my crew.
3793790 3796058 Our operator, Seq.
3798161 3801964 Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.
3802031 3803566 Nice to meet you.
3804667 3806702 Dad loved redwoods.
3806769 3808037 When he escaped the Matrix
3808104 3809672 and found out they no longer existed,
3809739 3811307 it almost killed him.
3811374 3812508 Lucky, he met Mom
3813442 3815011 and here I am.
3815077 3818948 This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.
3819549 3820783 Hi.
3820850 3823286 You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.
3823352 3826022 Roland was your grandfather?
3826689 3827857 He always laughed,
3827924 3828958 joking how he never believed in you.
3829926 3831327 But, in private, he said that
3831394 3833663 you freed his mind a second time.
3833729 3835798 Uh, not to fanboy out here,
3835865 3837867 but this is kind of a huge moment for me.
3837934 3840403 Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.
3840469 3841571 A what?
3841637 3844874 There's a lot of people out there like me
3844941 3847176 who are a little bit obsessed with your life.
3847243 3848411 I would never have recognized
3848477 3849745 your Modal if it weren't for him.
3849812 3851047 Whenever you're feeling up for it,
3851113 3853049 I've got, like, a million questions.
3853115 3855585 Me too. Starting with them.
3856886 3858087 [Bugs] It's okay.
3858721 3859922 Come meet him.
3859989 3861424 This is Cybebe.
3861490 3862892 That's Octacles.
3862959 3865695 -That's Lumin8. -[chittering]
3865761 3867930 Machines are on our side now?
3867997 3869265 They are synthients.
3869332 3871033 It's a word they prefer to "Machines."
3871100 3872368 Your contact with the Synthient City
3872435 3874871 had a huge impact on their world.
3874937 3875972 [Bugs] That's what I meant.
3876038 3877373 What you changed
3877440 3879175 that nobody believed could ever be changed.
3881010 3883579 The meaning of "our side."
3883646 3885114 [Cybebe warbling softly]
3887283 3889085 Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives
3889151 3890419 to help get you out.
3891787 3892989 Thank you.
3894423 3895358 But why?
3895424 3898060 [Morpheus] Not all seek to control.
3898127 3900229 Just as not all wish to be free.
3901898 3903232 What is that?
3903299 3905501 An exomorphic-particle codex. It's pretty new.
3905568 3907770 It gives programs access to this world.
3907837 3909105 Within limits.
3909171 3912241 Limits are the domain of the limited.
3912308 3913743 Morpheus.
3913809 3914877 Thank you.
3914944 3916445 It was my honor.
3918147 3919415 [chuckles] Wow.
3919482 3920750 -[crew chuckles] -How does it work?
3920816 3922385 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3922451 3923486 If you want,
3923552 3924954 I can download the codex manual for you.
3925021 3927356 -Sure. -Downloading used to be fun.
3927423 3929859 Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.
3929926 3931627 Can I ask them something?
3934530 3937800 When you unplugged me, there was another pod?
3937867 3939068 [warbling softly]
3939135 3942138 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3943139 3944573 It could be Trinity.
3945474 3946876 It's her.
3946943 3950179 I figured we were going to have this conversation.
3950246 3953215 Look, you were not a typical flush-and-grab.
3953282 3955017 You were in this weird tower that Cybebe
3955084 3957086 had never accessed, and she's now exiled.
3957153 3959555 We burned our one shot for you.
3959622 3961724 Even if it were Trinity and she wanted to be free,
3961791 3963759 we have no idea how to do it.
3963826 3965027 Yet.
3967296 3970099 Nobody believed we'd ever find him,
3970166 3971367 but we did.
3973703 3975571 Okay.
3975638 3979008 We don't know how to get her out... yet.
3980810 3983579 Captain, we're approaching security clearance.
3984847 3985982 We're here.
3986048 3987249 Zion?
3995157 3996592 Have a seat.
3996659 3999628 This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.
3999695 4000496 Quite a few synthients
4000563 4002198 deserve that title before me.
4002264 4003299 [Control on radio] Mnemosyne, you are cleared
4003366 4004867 for landing. Welcome home.
4004934 4006669 [Hanno] Thank you, Control.
4006736 4008337 Um, we're about to crash.
4009171 4011273 [dramatic music playing]
4013909 4015077 [chuckles]
4015144 4016445 General realized we were
4016512 4018514 never going to beat the Sentinels, so...
4018581 4020750 we just got better at hiding from them.
4025254 4027089 Welcome to Io.
4028591 4029992 Io.
4030059 4031827 [sweeping music playing]
4036332 4039268 Wow. That looks real.
4039668 4041337 Bio-sky.
4044707 4047209 Works kind of like grow lights.
4047276 4048844 It's way more complex than that.
4048911 4051480 It pulls water from the crust, hydronating the air.
4051547 4054850 It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles.
4055951 4057386 Plus... [sighs]
4058087 4059922 it is pretty to look at.
4059989 4061791 As opposed to that.
4063159 4065694 I guess the general sent us a welcome party.
4083913 4085448 God damn.
4086549 4087683 It is you.
4088584 4089718 Niobe?
4091520 4095224 A few more wrinkles and a few less teeth,
4095291 4098794 but wise enough to know I don't know anything.
4098861 4101664 I sure as shit never saw this coming.
4102364 4103699 Neither did I.
4103766 4104967 I told you he was alive.
4105034 4107169 Captain, you and your crew have been grounded.
4107236 4108804 General, if you'd just let me explain.
4108871 4111507 The protocols are put in place for everyone's protection.
4111574 4113442 I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity
4113509 4114977 and I was afraid we'd lose him.
4115044 4117780 But, General, people have been waiting for so long.
4119348 4120716 We found The One.
4122451 4124353 I don't believe in The One.
4126388 4127656 I never did.
4128190 4129458 No?
4130359 4132027 Me neither.
4132094 4134463 But there was a time
4134530 4137233 when you trusted me with your ship,
4137299 4139135 against the Council's orders.
4139201 4141370 The world was different then.
4143105 4144740 We were different.
4146842 4148177 Report to the docks.
4148244 4150012 Scrub down the Mnemosyne.
4150079 4152281 Transfer your access codes.
4152348 4153883 You are done, Captain.
4153949 4154950 [gasps softly]
4163425 4165461 We need to talk.
4170499 4173269 [Niobe] When word first came
4173335 4175638 that it actually might be you...
4179408 4183279 I didn't know how I would feel in this moment.
4191053 4192888 It is nice to see you.
4192955 4195791 -It's good to see you too. -[glasses clink]
4201630 4204366 A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.
4204433 4207403 [chuckles] Yes.
4207469 4209405 A lot has changed.
4210873 4212775 Except maybe you.
4215477 4217246 You remember this?
4224253 4227022 It's so easy to forget how much noise
4227089 4228958 the Matrix pumps into your head
4229024 4230859 until you unplug.
4230926 4232127 [Neo sighs]
4232194 4233662 Yeah.
4233729 4236599 Something else makes the same kind of noise.
4236665 4239001 Takes over every damn thing,
4239068 4240769 just like the Matrix.
4242304 4243505 War.
4245007 4247776 I stood at the barricade of the Temple.
4249545 4251847 Staring at the army of Sentinels,
4252848 4255651 waiting for them to kill every one of us.
4257086 4260289 But then, they left.
4261323 4263859 They said you saved us.
4263926 4264960 I didn't believe it.
4265027 4268564 Every night I would dream of attack sirens.
4269098 4270499 But then,
4273035 4275337 I would wake up to this...
4279141 4280709 silence.
4284146 4285681 I'm ashamed of it now.
4285748 4289718 My pessimism of how long it took me to believe
4289785 4293055 a world without war was possible.
4294423 4296458 You gave me that.
4296525 4299528 You gave that gift to us all.
4299595 4303365 And it is the gift that continues to bear fruit.
4306001 4307603 Come help me get up.
4307670 4309471 Let's take a walk.
4309538 4312841 [mysterious music playing]
4322451 4324019 [elevator door opens]
4333529 4335698 Oh! Beautiful.
4336665 4339702 This is Freya, head of botany.
4339768 4342971 And this is Quillion, our lead digitologist.
4343038 4347042 I presume our guest needs no introduction.
4347109 4349945 Nothing travels faster than light,
4350012 4351213 except gossip.
4351280 4352481 [Freya chuckles]
4353549 4355017 Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
4357086 4358320 A strawberry?
4358387 4359955 Using digital code from the Matrix,
4360022 4362458 we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.
4362524 4363959 And they grow here?
4364026 4365694 It's not easy augmenting the genome
4365761 4368430 to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...
4368497 4370165 -We're getting there. -[chuckles]
4370999 4372735 Go ahead. Try it.
4378874 4380008 [Niobe chuckles]
4380075 4382444 We're quite excited about the blueberries.
4382511 4384413 You remember that shit we used to eat?
4384480 4386882 That slop that tasted like rust.
4388317 4392054 Zion could have never made something like this.
4392121 4393689 Why?
4393756 4396392 Because we needed synthients
4396458 4398560 and DI like him.
4398627 4401864 Zion was stuck in the past. Stuck in war.
4401930 4404500 Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
4404566 4408370 They believed that it had to be us or them.
4408437 4411373 This city was built by us
4411440 4413175 and them.
4418781 4420516 What happened to Zion?
4420582 4423952 I've been waiting for you to ask that question.
4425921 4429258 All of the troubles started in the Machine Cities.
4429324 4433095 Power plants were unable to produce enough energy.
4433162 4436999 Nothing can breed violence like scarcity.
4438634 4440202 For the first time,
4440269 4443705 we saw machines at war with one other.
4446708 4450712 We got word from the Oracle of a new power rising.
4452614 4455217 That was the last we heard from her.
4458987 4460222 Morpheus.
4460289 4464693 [Niobe] After the siege, he was elected unanimously.
4464760 4467696 High Chair of the Council.
4467763 4471133 Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]
4471200 4475471 But as rumors of this new power spread,
4475537 4477005 he ignored them.
4477072 4481810 He was certain what you had done could not be undone.
4481877 4485681 All of these people never stopped believing in miracles,
4485747 4488217 believing in you.
4500295 4501763 I'm sorry.
4503565 4505934 How could I know this would happen?
4506001 4508337 We didn't understand all of it back then.
4508403 4510172 No more than we do now.
4510239 4513709 I didn't come here to cause you problems, Niobe,
4514610 4516545 but I need your help.
4518113 4519548 Trinity is alive.
4519615 4521383 Then there is another question.
4521450 4523252 Why did they keep her alive?
4523318 4524620 I can't answer that.
4524686 4528056 But if there's a chance I can free her,
4528123 4529725 I have to try.
4529791 4533729 Even if it means endangering everyone in this city?
4537766 4539668 I'm sorry, Neo.
4539735 4543305 I won't let what happened to Zion happen to Io.
4545073 4546575 I hope you'll forgive an old woman
4546642 4549711 for asking you to go with Sheperd, here,
4549778 4551280 till we have better understanding
4551346 4552814 of what's going on.
4552881 4555817 You're going to imprison me after I just got free?
4555884 4559721 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4559788 4562691 but neither does growing old.
4562758 4564927 But you don't hear me complaining.
4567596 4569164 [elevator whirring]
4576738 4578707 Sorry.
4578774 4580909 I've never met a legend before.
4584212 4585280 Neo.
4586615 4588383 Sheperd. [breathes shakily]
4588450 4589585 [chuckles in disbelief]
4589651 4591687 Crazy. You're real.
4593455 4594756 "Real."
4595657 4597826 There's that word again.
4603198 4605601 [Sheperd] People talk a lot about the old days.
4605667 4607836 About you, the viral Agent.
4607903 4610706 The siege of Zion.
4610772 4612841 Everything was simpler back then.
4613709 4615310 People wanted to be free.
4617412 4619247 It's different now.
4619314 4622951 Sometimes it feels like people gave up.
4624019 4625754 Like the Matrix won.
4625821 4627222 [unlocks door]
4628590 4630092 This is you.
4633962 4636331 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4638433 4640135 Is it true you could fly?
4644806 4646008 Cool.
4650846 4652214 [locks door]
4665594 4667062 [trickling]
4675370 4676405 [Morpheus grunts]
4676471 4677839 Morpheus.
4677906 4680876 Oh. General stuck you in the Rapunzel tower.
4681977 4683078 [Morpheus exhales]
4683145 4684813 On the upside, it's a nice view.
4684880 4686982 What happened to Bugs and the others?
4687049 4688750 They're supposed to be sterilizing the Mnemosyne
4688817 4690919 -with a toothbrush. -"Supposed to be"?
4690986 4692254 Well, I could tell you that they're standing by,
4692320 4693689 waiting for you to make the choice
4693755 4695490 to remain meekly incarcerated
4695557 4698060 or bust the hell out of here and go and find Trinity.
4699594 4700796 But that ain't a choice.
4702597 4705067 [dramatic music playing]
4713241 4715410 [Sheperd] General, what should we do?
4718914 4721483 [Freya] Bugs has the same independence of mind
4721550 4722984 she had the day you freed her.
4723051 4726154 This is not independence of mind.
4726221 4727222 It's mutiny.
4728557 4729825 [Freya] Come on, 'Be.
4729891 4732894 I know how much you hated locking him up.
4732961 4735731 Just like I know there's a part of you
4735797 4738900 that's relieved now that he's gone.
4740202 4744139 We've worked so hard to keep Io safe.
4746775 4748443 This scares me.
4758920 4760388 That's her.
4760455 4761490 [Seq] On the bridge.
4761890 4763125 Got her.
4769765 4771700 [engine revving]
4771767 4774002 It's sick how the Semblance works.
4774069 4776772 You see flashes of the real her, but...
4776838 4778507 the way she reads...
4780208 4782978 Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.
4784646 4787949 This is a tough question, Neo, but it has to be asked.
4788984 4791186 What if she's happy where she is?
4792621 4793955 How did I read?
4795857 4797959 Exactly like her.
4801663 4803832 Take us to broadcast depth.
4803899 4806368 [suspenseful music playing]
4815076 4816578 Thank you for helping me.
4818213 4820282 Most of us are here because of you.
4822884 4824052 I also admit our only chance
4824119 4825620 to get out of the general's doghouse
4825687 4827289 is for you to find your mojo.
4828957 4831526 What if I can't be what I once was?
4833094 4834696 -Then we're all fucked. -[signal beeps]
4834763 4836097 [Hanno] Two minutes.
4836164 4837599 Two minutes to broadcast.
4846708 4848043 [Seq] I slipped you in through a hotel room.
4848109 4849878 [Seq chuckles]
4849945 4851446 Should be safe.
4862123 4863692 Portal's open.
4863758 4865994 Closest I could get you is the warehouse near her garage.
4866061 4867562 Whole zone's crawling with bots.
4868864 4870498 Let's go.
4897792 4900795 So, what do you think of him?
4900862 4903765 I was kinda worried at first because he's so much older.
4903832 4906334 The beard, the hair... Oh.
4906401 4909838 -No, totally works for me. -[scoffs] You idiot.
4909905 4911339 I mean "The One" thing.
4912841 4915810 You know, everyone that shipped with him died.
4915877 4918947 Oh, yeah. He's gonna get us all killed, for sure.
4922183 4923385 [guns cocking]
4924085 4925687 Predictable as ever.
4927889 4929758 Smith.
4929824 4932027 Smith? As in, "the" Smith?
4932093 4933295 [chuckles]
4940201 4941536 This is so insane.
4941603 4942971 There's so many theories about the two of them
4943038 4944706 and they're standing right there.
4944773 4946274 This code is freaky!
4946341 4949344 He's like an Agent, but not.
4953348 4955150 An appeal to reason.
4959187 4960655 How did you find us?
4960722 4963792 You never appreciated our relationship.
4963858 4965193 Not like The Analyst.
4965260 4967262 -The what? -My doctor.
4967329 4971099 He used our bond and turned it into a chain.
4971166 4972734 It's so obvious once you see it, right?
4972801 4976271 But this whole altered-code update really blew my mind.
4976338 4978273 I still don't know how he did it.
4978340 4981142 You, as a balding nerd.
4981209 4983011 Hilarious.
4983078 4985580 And me... [sighs]
4985647 4988316 even more perfect.
4988383 4990251 Maybe a little too far on the piercing blue eyes.
4990318 4992287 What do you think?
4992354 4994456 What do you want, Smith?
4996624 4998827 I have such dreams, Tom.
4998893 5000662 Big dreams.
5000729 5003465 Well, mostly just extremely violent revenge fantasies,
5003531 5005066 but in order for me to pursue mine,
5005133 5007102 I need to dissuade you from pursuing yours.
5007168 5010805 Hmm. Sounds like conflict.
5012607 5014209 Inevitable?
5015243 5016611 Doesn't have to be.
5016678 5018947 All you have to do is stay out of the Matrix,
5019014 5020448 and leave the good doctor to me.
5020515 5022884 You can have him. I'm here for Trinity.
5022951 5024452 That's the trouble, Tom.
5024519 5027322 He knew you'd come, just like I did.
5027389 5028857 [scoffs]
5028923 5030291 Trust me.
5031126 5032694 You're not ready for him.
5032761 5035597 Captain, I'm reading portals from the lower frequencies.
5040769 5044172 I won't have his leash on my neck again.
5051513 5053748 I found some old acquaintances of yours.
5054849 5058286 -Bugs! -[growling]
5063491 5064826 [ominous music playing]
5069197 5070465 [snarls]
5071866 5072967 Exiles.
5073034 5074102 I thought they were all purged.
5074169 5075770 [man] You?
5075837 5076938 [excitedly] Oh!
5077005 5079307 It is you!
5079374 5080542 [man speaking French]
5080608 5084379 All these years. I can't believe it.
5084913 5086681 Oh, God.
5086748 5090718 You stole my life!
5090785 5092620 [speaking French]
5095457 5096925 [in English] What the Merv is trying to say,
5096991 5099494 is that their situation is a little bit like mine.
5099561 5101796 To have their lives back, yours has to end.
5103298 5104799 [bullet whizzing]
5105533 5106468 Kill him!
5106534 5108470 [tense music playing]
5112173 5113374 [blade slicing]
5114309 5115910 [all grunting]
5119814 5122250 You ruined
5122317 5125353 every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5125420 5128256 We had grace.
5133128 5134796 We had style!
5134863 5136731 We had conversation!
5136798 5138867 Not this... [mimics text message sound]
5138933 5140635 [all grunting]
5151212 5152514 -[bone cracks] -[yells]
5163391 5166961 Art, films, books were all better!
5167028 5170231 Originality mattered!
5170298 5172267 You gave us Face-Zucker-suck
5172333 5175770 and Cock-me-climatey- Wiki-piss-and-shit!
5196591 5197759 [screams]
5205433 5207368 [screaming]
5208102 5209938 [ominous music builds]
5220281 5221883 [man groans]
5221950 5223551 I still know kung fu.
5225253 5226454 Neo!
5227255 5228590 [Smith yells]
5237565 5238967 [both grunting]
5256084 5257619 Just like old times.
5262223 5263691 [tense music playing]
5283911 5285013 [Neo groaning]
5288583 5290018 [woman shrieks]
5296557 5297959 [man yelling]
5315143 5316377 Neo.
5318046 5320815 I've been thinking about us, Tom.
5320882 5324352 Look how binary is the form, the nature of things.
5325420 5326821 Ones and zeros.
5326888 5327955 [grunting]
5328022 5329057 Light and dark.
5331225 5333227 Choice and its absence.
5333294 5334529 [Smith grunts]
5336564 5338900 Anderson and Smith.
5341002 5342704 [dramatic music playing]
5373401 5374635 [gasps]
5375503 5377772 You've lost something, Tom.
5381676 5383611 You're not what you used to be.
5384846 5385880 It's true.
5390084 5391419 [grunts]
5395056 5396557 [jaw cracks]
5399227 5401162 -Nice one. -Thanks.
5409070 5410204 Come on, Neo.
5425186 5427155 [Neo groaning]
5430591 5431859 [panting]
5432860 5433895 [gasps]
5435229 5437665 Captain. You okay?
5437732 5440701 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5440768 5442069 Smith is killing him.
5442136 5443438 [Bugs] Where?
5443504 5444906 [Neo groaning]
5450878 5453014 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5455650 5457785 After all, you are the one who set me free...
5459020 5460021 again.
5461923 5463024 So, you, more than anyone,
5463090 5464892 understands why I can't go back.
5465860 5467428 [grunts]
5467495 5469197 You should have listened to me.
5471466 5473167 Now you'll never see her again.
5474569 5475803 [grunts]
5477905 5479207 [yells]
5479273 5480508 [energy explodes]
5486681 5488015 What was that?
5488082 5489550 That was Neo.
5491085 5492119 Mojo rising.
5492186 5493321 [Lumin8 chittering]
5493387 5494655 [Seq exclaims]
5500161 5501462 [Bugs] You all right?
5501529 5503231 Yeah.
5503297 5504398 It's gonna trigger a response.
5504465 5505700 I got multiple exits ready.
5505766 5507301 [The Merovingian] This is not over yet!
5507368 5510071 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5510137 5512473 [speaking French]
5512540 5513741 [spits]
5517144 5518412 [Bugs] We should go.
5518479 5519680 I can't.
5519747 5521749 I have to talk to her.
5521816 5523951 Neo, those Exiles were older than you,
5524018 5525219 and we barely handled them.
5526120 5527255 [sighs]
5528756 5530324 You really wanna do this now?
5535663 5537031 I mean...
5540868 5542537 you look like shit.
5542603 5545006 [buzzing]
5553814 5556384 Oh, my God. What? What happened?
5556450 5557585 An accident.
5557652 5560087 [Tiffany] Kush! Call a doctor.
5560154 5561756 It's fine.
5562557 5564725 I don't have a lot of time.
5564792 5566527 I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5566594 5569163 After we spoke, I realized...
5569897 5572099 my life wasn't a life.
5573568 5576370 At some point, I think I gave up
5576437 5578739 searching for something real.
5585012 5586247 Wait.
5587682 5590217 Something happened.
5590284 5592853 I looked for you at the coffee shop.
5594589 5596958 I began to wonder if I imagined you.
5598025 5600695 And then last night I had a dream.
5600761 5603497 In the dream, you were surrounded by police,
5603564 5606067 then they started chasing us.
5606133 5609203 -Us? -You were on my bike with me.
5611372 5612840 How did it end?
5614175 5615309 Not good.
5617878 5621182 I've had dreams that weren't just dreams.
5621248 5623751 You mean a dream that came true?
5626187 5628623 [bell tinkling]
5628689 5631158 [suspenseful music playing]
5631225 5633995 Finally, we can talk like adults.
5635663 5638833 I hate lying. I do. It exhausts me.
5640401 5642570 Tiff and I have been waiting for you...
5642637 5643871 like, forever.
5643938 5646440 [distorted rewinding]
5650911 5652313 Deja vu, right?
5654081 5656250 Oh, no use. You can't beat time.
5656317 5660121 This rewind is happening faster than you can blink.
5664892 5667028 You gave me the idea.
5669830 5673134 Allow me to sum up our goal in a single word.
5676203 5677338 "Bullet time."
5677405 5678939 [grunts in slow motion]
5679006 5681108 I know. Kind of ironic,
5681175 5684979 using the power that defined you to control you. [chuckles]
5685046 5687782 I kept such a close eye on you
5687848 5690284 and still you found a way out.
5690351 5692953 Clever monkey, using that Modal.
5693788 5694989 Call me an optimist,
5695056 5697191 but this could all be for the best.
5697258 5700194 The skin's not looking too bad this time.
5700261 5702863 I know some of this will be difficult for you to hear,
5702930 5704498 after everything you went through.
5704565 5705933 All that pain and suffering,
5706000 5708903 only to learn the world doesn't end when you do.
5710337 5711405 Surprise.
5715309 5717411 [Neo grunts]
5717478 5718779 I was there when you died.
5718846 5721315 [Neo screaming]
5721382 5722383 I said to myself,
5722450 5725820 "Here is the anomaly of anomalies."
5725886 5728789 What an extraordinary opportunity.
5730224 5731826 First, I had to convince the Suits
5731892 5733360 to let me rebuild the two of you.
5733427 5734962 Why her? Getting there.
5735029 5736897 And don't worry, she can't hear me.
5736964 5739967 Resurrecting you both was crazy expensive.
5740034 5741402 Like renovating a house.
5741469 5743904 Took twice as long, cost twice as much.
5746574 5747842 [gasps]
5747908 5750344 I thought you'd be happy to be alive again.
5751378 5752680 So wrong.
5752747 5754381 -[machine whirring] -[screaming]
5754448 5757952 Did you know hope and despair are nearly identical in code?
5758018 5759920 [screaming]
5759987 5762056 We worked for years,
5762123 5763824 trying to activate your source code.
5763891 5767261 I was about to give up, when I realized...
5770331 5771432 Trinity.
5771499 5773534 ...it was never just you.
5773601 5776737 Alone, neither of you is of any particular value.
5776804 5778472 [Trinity screaming]
5778539 5779740 Like acids and bases,
5779807 5782076 you're dangerous when mixed together.
5782143 5785112 Every sim where you two bonded...
5785179 5787348 Let's just say bad things happened.
5789383 5790951 Neo!
5795122 5798492 However, as long as I managed to keep you close,
5798559 5800194 but not too close,
5800261 5803430 I discovered something incredible.
5803497 5807134 Now, my predecessor loved precision.
5807201 5810805 His Matrix was all fussy facts and equations.
5810871 5812740 He hated the human mind.
5812807 5814175 So he never bothered to realize
5814241 5815509 that you don't give a shit about facts.
5815576 5817011 It's all about fiction.
5817077 5821615 The only world that matters is the one in here.
5821682 5824919 And you people believe the craziest shit.
5825352 5826520 Why?
5826587 5829290 What validates and makes your fictions real?
5830257 5831325 Feelings.
5832493 5834028 Allow me.
5835229 5836931 Kush, here, is one of my handlers.
5836997 5838332 They're everywhere.
5838399 5841135 Such a pain, cloning Agents over a coppertop.
5841202 5843571 Far more effective just to saturate a population.
5845439 5848442 And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.
5848509 5849643 [chuckles]
5856684 5858219 [gun fires in slow motion]
5860788 5864058 Ooh! Nicely done.
5865359 5868762 You ever wonder why you have nightmares?
5868829 5871599 Why your own brain tortures you?
5871665 5875202 It's actually us, maximizing your output.
5875269 5876437 It works just like this.
5876503 5879206 Oh, no! Can you stop the bullet?
5879273 5882276 If only you could move faster.
5882343 5884979 [chuckles] Here's the thing about feelings.
5885045 5887314 They're so much easier to control than facts.
5888148 5890150 Turns out, in my Matrix,
5890217 5893721 the worse we treat you, the more we manipulate you,
5893787 5896123 the more energy you produce.
5896190 5898425 It's nuts. [chomps]
5898492 5900127 I've been setting productivity records
5900194 5901462 every year since I took over.
5901528 5904331 And, the best part, zero resistance.
5904398 5905900 People stay in their pods,
5905966 5909003 happier than pigs in shit.
5909069 5910404 The key to it all?
5910471 5911739 You.
5911805 5913073 And her.
5913140 5915309 Quietly yearning for what you don't have,
5915376 5917845 while dreading losing what you do.
5917912 5919513 For 99.9% of your race,
5919580 5922249 that is the definition of reality.
5922316 5925319 Desire and fear, baby.
5925386 5928389 Just give the people what they want, right?
5929523 5930991 [squelches]
5937564 5940634 She's the only home you have, Thomas.
5940701 5944038 Come home before something terrible happens.
5944104 5946473 [tense music playing]
5949476 5951078 [Neo grunts]
5952813 5954315 [keyboard clacking]
5954381 5955883 -Bugs! -I hear him.
5955950 5959019 -[sirens approaching] -[tires screech]
5962056 5963357 Trinity!
5963424 5965225 -You shouldn't call me that. -I'm sorry.
5966660 5967861 I have to go.
5967928 5969229 But I'll be back.
5970164 5972566 Neo! Time to go.
5973667 5974969 -[gasps] -[alarm blaring]
5975035 5976737 -Sentinels? -Worse.
5978238 5979239 [Sheperd on radio] General ordered me
5979306 5980307 to look after the ship.
5980374 5982309 So you shadowed us?
5982376 5984044 Check your long-range scans.
5984111 5986046 Squids are combing this area.
5986113 5987715 He's right.
5987781 5988983 You can stay here and die,
5989049 5991285 or come back and face a court-martial.
5991352 5993487 And you call that a choice?
6000661 6002763 [Niobe] Sheperd should have left you to the Squids.
6002830 6006200 I'm too damn old to sit through some boring-ass trial.
6006266 6007634 Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
6007701 6009636 Do shut your mouth.
6009703 6011839 Do address me as General.
6011905 6016276 And do not rob my ex-captain of her agency,
6016343 6018345 which she exercised with her own
6018412 6022082 particular brand of shortsighted stupidity.
6023117 6024351 Shortsighted?
6025886 6029790 You care more about growing fruit than freeing minds.
6029857 6032459 We are not going to have this argument again.
6032526 6034928 It's not an argument. It's a fact.
6034995 6036296 You gave up on people.
6037598 6039967 I tell you what I'm going to give up on
6040034 6041268 and it's you!
6043504 6045572 Sheperd, get her out of my sight!
6045639 6046707 General...
6048642 6049743 Disarm!
6049810 6051478 Kujaku's a friend.
6056016 6057885 [Kujaku warbling]
6057951 6059686 Hello, friend.
6059753 6061155 [chittering softly]
6062089 6063290 Okay.
6064558 6065726 Him?
6072666 6074268 General.
6074334 6075803 Thank you for seeing me.
6075869 6077538 I figured if there was anyone
6077604 6079940 who could make sense of this mess,
6080007 6081842 it would be you.
6081909 6083010 Hello, Neo.
6083077 6085012 I know you.
6085079 6087181 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6089183 6090384 [clicks tongue]
6090451 6091718 Why?
6091785 6093520 We met a long time ago.
6095122 6096356 Good morning.
6099026 6100094 Sati.
6100160 6102663 My father knew we'd meet again,
6102729 6105666 though he would have wished for happier circumstances.
6105732 6107534 His inadvertent role in what happened to you
6107601 6109937 was the greatest regret of his life.
6110003 6111839 I don't understand.
6113240 6114908 My father was the chief engineer
6114975 6116176 at the Anomaleum.
6116243 6117678 [Niobe] The what?
6117744 6120781 My father designed the resurrection pods
6120848 6122850 where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.
6124918 6126186 [Niobe] I'm sorry.
6126253 6127721 You knew what happened to him?
6127788 6131191 You knew that he and Trinity both were alive...
6132059 6133393 and you didn't tell me?
6133460 6136263 There were times I doubted my decision, Niobe.
6136330 6138098 But Io needed you.
6138165 6139433 This city needed to be built
6139500 6141635 for your people as well as mine.
6142703 6144538 If I would have told you everything,
6144605 6146807 you would have had a very difficult choice to make.
6146874 6148509 My friends
6149643 6152246 let me make my own choices.
6152312 6154281 If it was a mistake,
6154348 6156517 you have my deepest apologies.
6158452 6159753 Why are you here now?
6159820 6162422 Neo's escape has destabilized the Matrix.
6162489 6163857 The Anomaleum draws its current
6163924 6165259 from Trinity alone now.
6165325 6167461 A fail-safe has been triggered to reset
6167528 6169496 the Matrix back to the previous version.
6169563 6171398 But The Analyst halted the reset.
6171465 6172733 He's convinced the authorities
6172799 6174835 that you will soon return voluntarily.
6176036 6177871 And why would he say that?
6177938 6181208 Because if I don't go back, he'll kill Trinity.
6183744 6186246 Faced with returning to your pod
6186313 6189082 or enduring Trinity's death again.
6189149 6190517 What would you choose, Neo?
6191418 6192819 I'll go back.
6194521 6196723 Well, The Analyst knows you well,
6196790 6199459 but that knowledge has made him incautious.
6199526 6201261 After you escaped,
6201328 6204198 he should have accepted his losses and devacuated Trinity.
6204264 6207201 But that would have prevented this extraordinary opportunity
6207267 6209336 that now exists before us.
6209903 6212773 A few hours ago,
6212839 6216109 no one would have been able to convince me
6216176 6220480 that I would be standing here, trying to explain a mission
6220547 6222649 as crazy as this one.
6226353 6228055 What are you doing?
6228121 6229656 -Volunteering. -Oh, no.
6229723 6234328 You are the one captain that I am ordering to go.
6234394 6235963 Now you don't have to order me, General,
6236029 6237731 'cause I'm volunteering.
6241068 6242669 I need two more.
6247140 6249843 Are you out of your minds?
6249910 6251979 You don't even know what it is.
6252045 6254982 General, we know you.
6255048 6256283 If you say this is important,
6256350 6258452 none of us is choosing to stay home.
6263790 6264825 Thank you.
6269763 6271898 Knuckle up, and good luck.
6283443 6286079 [dramatic music playing]
6286146 6287547 [Kujaku chittering]
6301862 6303463 [Sati] Trinity is held in the Anomaleum,
6303530 6305198 which is in this transmission tower.
6305265 6307668 The passages used to rescue Neo are now sealed
6307734 6309803 and a legion of Sentinels patrols the tower.
6309870 6312105 So, stealth will be paramount.
6312172 6313840 As long as we raise no alarms,
6313907 6315909 this first part of the mission should be the easiest.
6315976 6317444 You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,
6317511 6319246 sneaking across an entire power plant,
6319313 6320681 climbing a two-kilometer tower
6320747 6322549 guarded by thousands of Sentinels?
6322616 6323917 That's the easy part?
6323984 6325652 Exactly so.
6325719 6328088 Because all we have to do is convince someone
6328155 6329890 who does this every day
6329956 6331191 to take one of us along.
6331258 6333527 -[electricity crackling] -[dramatic music continues]
6354748 6356650 Fifty meters below the Anomaleum
6356717 6358151 is a stratum of amniotic filters.
6358218 6361755 Hidden along this edge is a small hexagonal vent.
6361822 6364958 This vent feeds the air intake into the corpuscular modifier,
6365025 6368128 which oxygenates the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.
6368862 6369963 I get it.
6370030 6372999 The exomorph slinkies up Neo's old umbilicus.
6374267 6375369 What could go wrong?
6375435 6377871 [tense music playing]
6388382 6389649 [grunts]
6405098 6406466 [straining]
6422282 6423683 [Sati] Once inside,
6423750 6425485 Morpheus will use the System Operator
6425552 6428021 to open the devacuator line and disengage the macerators.
6428088 6429589 [machinery clanking]
6431992 6433693 In order to unplug Trinity's body,
6433760 6435896 while her mind still remains connected to the Matrix,
6435962 6437597 I'm gonna need a second human brain
6437664 6438899 to implement the bypass.
6438965 6440700 And since Neo must be with The Analyst,
6440767 6443937 the only available mind that's a near-enough match
6444004 6445038 is yours.
6446473 6447474 Figures.
6447541 6449142 [tense music playing]
6465058 6466126 Thanks, Cybebe.
6467160 6468161 [grunts]
6474267 6476436 Does Trinity still have to take the red pill?
6476503 6477804 Since Kujaku and I are transferring
6477871 6479306 her consciousness onto the ship,
6479372 6480941 it's not strictly necessary.
6481007 6484978 But what matters is that this is her choice.
6485045 6488381 Extracting a confused or an uncertain mind will,
6488448 6489783 in all probability, kill her.
6489850 6492385 But even if it is what she wants,
6492452 6496189 won't The Analyst just order the Sentinels to stop you?
6496256 6497791 He will.
6497858 6500293 But if my plan works, it won't matter.
6500360 6501428 Why?
6501495 6503096 Because we'll already be gone.
6504831 6506666 Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,
6506733 6508201 there has to be a reason why.
6510437 6511671 When my father realized
6511738 6513974 how the Anomaleum was going to be used,
6514040 6517577 he covertly transferred the designs to me.
6517644 6520180 The Analyst discovered his betrayal
6520247 6522082 and had my parents purged.
6523250 6524718 [inhales sharply]
6524784 6527787 I would have been murdered too if it wasn't for Kujaku.
6530757 6534828 Not a day goes by that I don't grieve them.
6534895 6537998 I've been praying for this day for a very long time.
6541468 6542769 [door unlocks, opens]
6545972 6547707 We're coming up on broadcast.
6550143 6554180 I thought you should know that I'm here because of her.
6557584 6560086 All I ever wanted was to be as fearless as Trinity.
6562222 6565692 But I saw how she reacted in the garage, and I...
6565759 6568428 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6568495 6570063 What if we're too late?
6571798 6573667 What if she's not Trinity anymore?
6575368 6576736 [sighs]
6578905 6581808 I never believed I was The One.
6582542 6584044 But she did.
6584911 6586780 She believed in me.
6589215 6591685 It's my turn to believe in her.
6592586 6593787 [sighs]
6595855 6597991 [suspenseful music playing]
6616409 6618411 [Sati] This is where it gets tricky.
6629489 6632058 Have you ever done an operation like this?
6632626 6633893 Not yet.
6637464 6639366 [suspenseful music builds]
6655515 6656816 Here we go.
6656883 6658952 [suspenseful music continues]
6674501 6676503 Welcome home.
6676569 6678805 All I want is to talk to her.
6678872 6680573 Do you mean Tiff?
6680640 6683476 Come back, and you can talk to her as often as you like.
6683543 6684911 I mean, handsome Chad
6684978 6686379 may have something to say about it.
6686446 6689916 If she tells me this is what she wants,
6691084 6692218 you win.
6692285 6693420 Really?
6693486 6696122 But if she wants me,
6696189 6698158 then you'll let us go free.
6698224 6700894 And why would I do something as stupid as that?
6700960 6703897 Right now, I'm on a ship full of people who will unplug me
6703963 6706900 before they'll let you take me back.
6706966 6709002 If you want this Matrix,
6709069 6710804 this is your only chance.
6710870 6713840 But how do I know they won't unplug you anyway?
6713907 6717210 Same way I know you'll let us walk out of here.
6718511 6720880 [suspenseful music playing]
6742702 6744471 Okay.
6744537 6746106 I like tests.
6746873 6748708 We'll let Tiff decide.
6748775 6750510 [electricity crackling]
6762522 6763990 [Sati breathing heavily]
6765959 6767260 That's it.
6768461 6769863 Bypass is ready.
6769929 6771698 Now what?
6771765 6773099 We wait.
6773166 6775034 Doesn't it seem crazy to come all this way
6775101 6776836 and leave her here?
6776903 6779606 We must abide by her decision.
6779672 6781274 And if she says no,
6781975 6783543 what happens to Neo?
6783610 6784878 At this time,
6784944 6787747 the most important choice of Neo's life
6787814 6789349 is not his to make.
6796256 6798558 [slow suspenseful music playing]
6820246 6822215 I saw this in my dream.
6823516 6827153 If I was the Oracle, maybe I could explain it.
6827687 6829389 The Oracle.
6829455 6831157 From your game?
6832892 6835261 It's not a game.
6837363 6838531 Oh, God.
6843403 6844871 [Tiffany sighs]
6846005 6849475 After you left, I went home
6849542 6851277 and I played it.
6853613 6856115 I kept thinking,
6856182 6859485 why does this story feel like a memory?
6866693 6868428 There's a part of me
6870930 6874267 that feels like I have been waiting my whole life for you.
6877103 6879405 And that part is like,
6879472 6883142 "What the hell took you so long?" [sniffles]
6883209 6885378 I don't have an easy answer.
6887380 6889649 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6891084 6893119 Afraid of what might happen.
6894487 6897523 Afraid of hurting the only person I ever loved.
6899225 6902929 I wish I was who you think I am.
6904063 6905698 But look at me.
6907000 6909202 I can't be her.
6909269 6911304 -[Donnie] Mom! -[Brandon] Mom! Come on.
6911371 6912739 -Mom! -It's Callie.
6912805 6913873 Is this real?
6913940 6915074 [Donnie] You have to come with us.
6915141 6916509 [Brandon] Come on, we gotta go.
6916576 6918111 Tiff, hey. Don't know what's going on here,
6918177 6919512 but I'm glad we found you.
6919579 6920914 -She got hit by a car! -I know, it's crazy.
6920980 6922148 She was chasing after you.
6922215 6923483 They're casting her arm. We gotta go.
6923549 6925084 [Chad] Doctor said she's gonna be fine.
6925151 6926853 [Donnie] You have to come with us to the hospital.
6926920 6927987 It's too late.
6928054 6929355 I understand.
6929422 6931324 -Tiff, come on, let's go. -[Donnie] Come on.
6937764 6938998 What's happening?
6940900 6942035 Neo was wrong.
6942101 6944470 [somber music playing]
6975468 6976536 Tiffany.
6980106 6982642 Tiffany, you have to come with us.
6984210 6985645 Tiffany! [echoing]
6987814 6991684 I wish you would fucking stop calling me that.
6991751 6993353 I hate that name.
6994787 6996322 My name is Trinity
6996389 6998758 and you better take your hands off of me.
6999859 7001594 [Trinity grunting]
7009902 7011104 Neo!
7011504 7012505 Trinity!
7013673 7014674 Oh, shit.
7015975 7017210 Get her out. Get her out!
7017276 7019445 [grunts, yells]
7025952 7029288 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7029355 7032058 I own that mistake. Shouldn't have pressed.
7032125 7034994 Women used to be so easy to control.
7035061 7039699 You know there's no way I can let you two go free.
7043069 7044604 Cannot happen.
7047673 7050610 So, I guess it's deja vu all over again.
7051711 7053613 She dies
7053679 7055114 and it's all your fault.
7056382 7059218 Lies, lies and more lies.
7059819 7061054 Smith?
7061120 7062288 What has the world come to
7062355 7063456 when you can't even trust a program?
7063523 7066859 -How... -[gun clatters]
7066926 7069662 Tom and I have more in common than you know.
7069729 7072865 Once he got out, let's just say,
7073800 7075568 I was free to be me.
7076169 7077670 [grunts]
7083176 7085978 -Yeah! -Trinity?
7086045 7088281 [tense music playing]
7102295 7103729 [bell tinkling]
7111637 7113539 [all grunting]
7117376 7118845 [Trinity groaning]
7121414 7123249 [breathes shakily]
7134260 7135561 You ready?
7135628 7136863 Yeah.
7140133 7141667 [Bugs groans, yells]
7148207 7149475 [bell tinkling]
7150810 7151811 [cat yowls]

7158885 7160486 [distorted screaming]
7163222 7165858 [yells]
7168494 7170830 -[Sati grunts] -[screaming]
7173199 7174433 [screaming]
7178971 7180506 Oh, no.
7181874 7184310 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7201093 7202295 No.
7204297 7207934 [Neo and Trinity straining]
7208000 7209402 Stop them.
7209468 7212705 [both yelling]
7221380 7223382 [explosion]
7235161 7236562 You think this is over?
7236629 7238764 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7247673 7250009 Here, our unexpected alliance ends.
7251677 7254347 You know the difference between us, Tom?
7254413 7256315 Anyone could have been you.
7256382 7258517 Whereas I've always been anyone.
7260853 7262655 [grunting]
7263889 7265258 What just happened?
7265324 7266626 What?
7268527 7271163 -[alarm blaring] -Oh, no! Move! Move!
7271230 7272265 Get the hell out of there!
7272331 7274567 [tense music playing]
7276202 7278070 -How bad? -Like, all the bad.
7279372 7280873 Yeah, this is bad.
7282308 7283876 I don't suppose you can still fly?
7290950 7292918 [grunting]
7294287 7295955 Yeah, that's not happening.
7298190 7299825 [ominous music playing]
7319979 7321514 [all screaming]
7321580 7322982 Neo! Get on.
7323049 7324684 [engine revving]
7331590 7333459 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7333526 7335628 Everyone else, we stay with them!
7352611 7355114 -How is she? -Life signs are good.
7358884 7360553 Her signal's strong, Captain.
7363022 7364023 [Kujaku squawks]
7369295 7371497 Well done, Captain.
7373666 7375568 All we need is a miracle.
7375634 7377970 [tense music playing]
7381640 7382875 [siren wailing]
7389882 7390983 [Neo grunts]
7394320 7395721 [tires screech]
7403596 7404797 I hate bots.
7410970 7412872 -Get us out of here! -I'm trying!
7412938 7414840 The lockdown is tracking. Swarm is everywhere.
7414907 7416175 Never seen anything like this.
7426152 7427453 [grunts]
7429755 7431457 [siren wailing]
7433125 7434894 [tense music playing]
7436362 7437930 [engine revving]
7462121 7464223 Seq, what is that?
7469261 7470529 What's wrong?
7472164 7473699 What are you... [screams]
7477970 7478971 [grunts]
7481040 7483175 He's turning bots into bombs.
7485377 7486979 [glass shattering]
7489248 7491083 [bodies thudding]
7498224 7499859 [tires screeching]
7509702 7511203 [tires screeching]
7515574 7516909 Shit! [grunts]
7516976 7517977 Lexy?
7518043 7519845 [gunfire]
7526318 7527987 -[tires screeching] -[tram bell ringing]
7532358 7533492 Sheperd's in trouble.
7533559 7535027 [Lexy grunting]
7536562 7538364 Jack me in.
7538430 7540666 I can get you in. I don't know if I can get you out.
7546539 7548207 -No! -[tires screeching]
7555214 7556916 [motorcycle revving]
7561554 7562788 What are they doing?
7566725 7568360 Herding them into a kill zone.
7594420 7595788 [both groaning]
7599458 7600759 [Neo groaning]
7601493 7602795 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7602861 7605197 -[Lexy groaning] -Hang on, Lex.
7605264 7606699 [Lexy screaming]
7609401 7611203 -Lexy! -[grunting]
7618911 7621180 [tense music playing]
7653479 7654747 [SWAT officer] There they are!
7667860 7669328 [Neo straining]
7677436 7679004 [all grunting]
7681106 7682241 Morpheus!
7686145 7687780 Lex.
7687846 7689882 -Bugsy. -Hell yeah!
7690683 7692418 Seq, where's Neo?
7692484 7693986 It's bad. They're pinned.
7694053 7695254 Heading to a roof.
7707566 7709101 [dramatic music playing]
7715674 7717109 [Neo grunting]
7742601 7745104 [Neo yelling, grunts loudly]
7756648 7758083 [both grunting]
7760085 7762121 [machine beeping rapidly]
7764389 7765791 Nodal fibrillation is critical.
7765858 7767292 She'll die if we don't extract.
7787579 7790849 [soft dramatic music playing]
7794019 7796054 [inhales deeply]
7798323 7799958 [exhales]
7808133 7811003 It's so beautiful.
7826084 7828020 I remember this.
7829922 7832257 I remember us.
7850175 7852344 My dream ended here.
7863088 7864923 We can't go back.
7866825 7868093 We won't.
7883108 7885010 [evocative music playing]
7887179 7888614 Can they make the jump?
7893552 7894920 [music stops]
7902327 7904363 [slow evocative music playing]
7912404 7915207 [grunting]
7919745 7921246 I'm not doing this.
7921313 7922948 Are you doing this?
7924950 7926518 [dramatic music playing]
7937629 7939598 [helicopter hovering]
7946838 7948106 Bye.
7982874 7984509 [soft music playing]
8011169 8013038 -[bell tinkling] -[meows]
8013872 8015273 [crumbling in distance]
8018410 8020312 [suspenseful music playing]
8028987 8030622 How dramatic.
8031490 8032624 "Tiffany"?
8032691 8035827 [chuckles] It was a private joke.
8035894 8037329 An amusement, that's all.
8037396 8039831 An amusement? Hmm.
8039898 8041433 [flesh tears]
8041500 8043769 -[softly] Whoa. -[groaning]
8043835 8045337 Kind of like that?
8045404 8046438 [chokes]
8048006 8049474 [gulps]
8049541 8052244 Okay. Ow.
8052310 8053779 If you hated the name so much,
8053845 8056081 why did you heel like a good little bitch so long?
8056148 8057582 -[Trinity grunts] -[blade slices]
8057649 8059151 [body thuds]
8059217 8061486 Yeah. Definitely asked for that.
8063255 8065624 -[snaps fingers] -[The Analyst groaning]
8066658 8068693 [shudders] Can't you control her?
8071696 8073198 [groaning]
8074433 8076334 That was for using children.
8081106 8082574 We have a few questions.
8082641 8084609 You tried to activate the fail-safe.
8084676 8085877 The Suits tried.
8085944 8088313 Obviously, without control of your source code,
8088380 8089714 I knew that was impossible.
8089781 8092217 So, why haven't the Suits purged you?
8092984 8095687 Because I know the system.
8095754 8098090 I know human beings.
8098156 8100325 And I know you.
8100392 8102727 [bones crack, sighs]
8102794 8105363 Right now, you're feeling good about what you've done.
8105430 8107833 You should. It was a victory. Bravo.
8108700 8109935 Now what?
8110001 8112671 You've come here to negotiate some kind of deal?
8112737 8114473 You think you hold all the cards,
8114539 8116908 because you can do whatever you want in this world.
8116975 8119311 I say, go for it.
8119377 8122047 Remake it. Knock yourselves out.
8122114 8124116 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8124182 8125383 But here's the thing.
8125450 8128386 The sheeple aren't going anywhere.
8128453 8129721 They like my world.
8129788 8132724 They don't want this sentimentality.
8132791 8134860 They don't want freedom or empowerment.
8134926 8137295 They want to be controlled.
8137362 8139397 They crave the comfort of certainty.
8139464 8142267 And that means you two, back in your pods,
8142334 8145804 unconscious and alone, just like them.
8147772 8149875 [both chuckle]
8149941 8152711 We're not here to negotiate anything.
8152777 8155113 We were on our way to remake your world.
8155180 8156781 Change a few things.
8156848 8157916 I kind of like
8157983 8159451 the "paint the sky with rainbows" idea.
8159518 8161419 Just remind people what a free mind can do.
8161486 8163121 I forgot. It's easy to forget.
8163188 8165524 -He makes it easy. -That, he does.
8165590 8167826 Something he should think about.
8168894 8170128 Before we got started,
8170195 8172931 we decided to stop by to say thank you.
8172998 8176101 You gave us something we never thought we could have.
8176168 8177636 And what is that?
8178370 8180238 Another chance.
8180305 8182374 [punk rock music playing]
8843434 8846370 Face reality, people. Movies are dead.
8846437 8848372 Games are dead.
8848439 8850141 Narrative? Dead.
8850208 8852109 Media is nothing but neuro-trigger response
8852176 8853411 and viral conditioning.
8853477 8855146 Wait, what are you two talking about?
8857381 8859150 Cat videos.
8859217 8862954 What we need is a series of videos
8863020 8865423 that we call "The Catrix."
