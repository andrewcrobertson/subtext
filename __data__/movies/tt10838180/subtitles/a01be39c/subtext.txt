49884 50968 [Device beeping]
51510 52929 [Phone line ringing]
58226 59852 - [Woman] Seq, I'm in.<br />- [Seq] Captain.
60019 62188 [Woman] You were right.<br />The skylight was a window pane.
62271 63624 [Seq] I've got serious interference.
63648 65691 [Woman] Weird. It's some kind of modal.
65858 67652 [Seq] Looks like old code.
67818 69138 [Woman] It feels really familiar.
69278 70839 [Seq] Drop a pin.<br />I 7! Signal for backup.
70863 72257 - [Woman] I'm gonna check it out.<br />- [Seq] Bugs?
72281 73884 If the general finds out<br />we've been fishing...
73908 75701 [Bugs] A quick peek can't hurt.
75868 77179 - [Static]<br />- [Seq] Did you hear that?
77203 78643 Shit. I think our signal was traced.
78704 80623 Bugs, this feels like a trap.
80790 81958 Bugs!
82124 83292 [Suspenseful music playing]
122039 124333 [SWAT officer] Freeze! Do not move!
124500 125501 We will shoot!
125626 128921 Very slowly, raise your hands.
129005 130423 [Suspenseful music playing]
142727 144270 [Lieutenant] Here we go.
150192 151360 Hey, where are you going?
151777 152987 You were warned, lieutenant.
153154 155239 I think we can handle one little girl.
158743 162079 You're wasting your time!<br />My men are bringing her down now.
162246 163289 No, lieutenant.
164498 166375 Your men are already dead.
174550 175551 [Gasps slowly]
176969 178220 Seq, you with me?
178387 179547 This old code keeps crashing.
179597 181241 Your projection's breaking up.<br />Switch to audio.
181265 183865 [Seq] Bugs, this is a direct violation<br />of the general's protocols.
183934 187021 I know, I know.<br />But something is happening here.
187938 189607 Something important.
189774 190858 [Bugs] Oh, fuck.
191025 192443 We know what happens next.
192610 194236 She kicks their ass.
198032 199575 [All grunting]
212922 213964 [Groans]
216842 218177 Now she makes a call.
218344 219464 [Woman] The line was traced.
219762 221889 - And then...<br />- Then she runs for her life.
222056 223265 [Woman] Are there any agents?
223432 224767 We know this story.
226394 227937 This is how it all began.
228687 230064 God damn it.
230648 231732 This is where he began.
232274 235152 You're thinking this modal is a loop?<br />Or a treadmill?
235653 238948 Some sort of sequencer<br />evolving a program to do what?
239115 240241 I don't know.
241492 242952 But I'm going to find out.
243119 244245 All right.
246288 247373 [Dramatic music playing]

255673 256715 [Panting]
269937 270938 [Woman grunts]
272356 273649 [Woman groaning]
275067 277319 So d√©ja vu<br />and yet it's obviously all wrong.
277486 279447 Why use old code<br />to mirror something new?
279613 280990 I don't know.
281323 282575 [All grunting]
293085 294086 [Panting]
294753 297548 If that's supposed to be Trinity,<br />that's not what happens.
299675 301552 Maybe this isn't the story<br />we think it is.
301719 304054 Bugs, you have to get out of here.
304221 306265 - It's gotta be a trap.<br />- [Helicopter whirring]
307725 308726 Shit.
311145 312605 [Ominous music playing]
313772 314773 [Bugs grunting]
319153 320154 [Bugs growls]

330164 331499 [Bugs screaming]
332041 333125 [Agent screaming]
333542 334585 [Both grunting]
346472 347515 [Bugs] Uh...
347890 349266 You all carry on.
349725 350726 As you were.
353771 355272 I'm just gonna...
356232 357566 See myself out.
358025 359026 Kill her.
360653 361654 [Grunts]
369161 370162 [Yells]
383175 384385 [Sirens approaching]
385928 386929 [Brakes screech]
392059 393143 [Gasps]
393227 394937 [Exclaims] Oh, seq!
396730 397856 [Tires screech]

416875 417876 [Gun cocks]
448866 450409 [Bugs straining]
450492 451785 [Dramatic music builds]
462796 464156 - Why did you save me?<br />- You first.
464298 465799 Who are you? Where did you come from?
465966 467009 Okay.
467635 468844 My name is bugs.
469470 471722 As in "bunny."
471889 473515 And tech that listens.
474683 476560 Do you know this is a modal?
477853 478937 What's a modal?
479104 481315 It's a simulation<br />used to evolve programs.
485235 487071 Do you understand that you are...
488030 489615 Digital sentience?
489782 491408 I know what I am.
491575 494870 Just like I know my job is to hunt down<br />and destroy sentience...
495037 496246 Like you.
500459 501960 And yet...
503754 504755 Here we are.
505172 506548 Here we are.
508217 510302 The other agents<br />don't know about this room?
512304 513514 How'd you find it?
513681 515599 No one was ever in the key shop,
516183 517309 so I started looking.
518602 520562 More you looked, the more you found.
521647 523190 Story of my life.
530322 531323 What?
533575 535077 I feel like I know this room.
543752 546130 Holy shit.
548590 550008 This is his apartment.
550092 551260 [Gasps]
551343 553137 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
553554 555431 I searched everywhere. He doesn't exist.
555597 557766 He stopped being Thomas a long time ago,
557933 560144 but maybe you know him by his real name.
560894 561979 Neo.
563480 564690 You do.
565774 567359 Oh, okay.
569528 572156 I can't believe this,<br />after all these years.
572322 575784 You see, most people<br />think that Neo is dead.
577202 578537 But I know he's not.
579580 581248 Because I've seen him.
583500 584501 Where?
585586 587921 It's not something<br />I can explain easily, but...
592593 595179 But the moment he looked at me,
595721 597264 I felt something...
600684 602311 Unlock my mind.
604855 605939 Okay.
608400 610194 Something like that happened to me.
615199 616784 I saw this pattern...
618160 619495 And it was everywhere.
621330 623624 We can't see it,<br />but we're all trapped inside
623707 625292 these strange, repeating loops.
626335 629087 Somehow, I saw it in the mirror.
629713 632299 Just a flicker,<br />but it was like you said.
637888 639765 And suddenly I understood.
640349 642726 This is not the real world.
645437 648524 [Agent] For the first time,<br />I felt real purpose.
649233 650734 I knew who I was
651318 653153 and what I had to do.
653821 655239 Who are you?
656657 658283 What do you have to do?
661245 662538 I am...
663372 664706 Morpheus.
665916 668126 And I have to find Neo.
669336 672172 [Bugs gasping]
672297 673632 Morpheus.
676635 678178 Okay. Okay.
678345 679388 Oh, my god!
679555 680755 I have to get you out of here.
680889 683016 I need to figure out<br />who built this modal.
683433 685018 Okay, come with me.
685185 687288 You have to be ready to leave.<br />You have to be really ready.
687312 688313 And if you're not,
688397 690157 if you think that<br />this is where you belong...
693193 694403 You call this a choice?
694570 696339 Oh, honestly, when somebody<br />offered me these things,
696363 697924 I went off on<br />binary conceptions of the world
697948 699588 and said there was no way<br />I was swallowing
699616 701410 some symbolic reduction of my life.
701577 704097 And the woman with the pills laughed<br />'cause I was missing the point.
704121 705664 What point?
705831 707833 The choice is an illusion.
708834 710919 You already know what you have to do.
717676 718760 Truth.
725475 726476 Okay.
726643 729396 There's an old building<br />with a skylight and lots of stairs.
729563 730731 The Lafayette.
730898 732458 One of the four back doors leads there.
733233 734443 [Morpheus] Oh.
734526 736004 - Don't fight it.<br />- Whoa, what's happening?
736028 737029 Keep breathing.
737195 740532 Extraction works pretty much the same<br />for humans and programs.
743368 744369 Ouch.
746914 748206 Okay.
750834 752252 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
752419 754087 I've never worn<br />different glasses before.
754254 756256 Yeah, looks good. Which door?
757090 758759 - It's gotta be...<br />- Okay.
763847 765182 Agent white.
765641 766808 Agent Smith?
766892 768143 [Laughs]
769311 770437 [Bugs grunts]
772606 773982 - [Bugs] Go!<br />- [Grunts]
778570 779821 [Men grunting]
781281 782866 Seq! Can you hear me?
783033 784284 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
784451 785678 Can you get us to the window pane?
785702 787579 Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!
790499 792167 [Morpheus exclaims, grunts]
797839 800008 That window! Go hard!
809059 810686 [Both screaming]
816400 818151 [Screaming fades]
827577 829705 [Keyboard clacking]
841425 843176 [Fast-paced music playing on speakers]
846388 848682 - [Computer buzzing]<br />- What the...
855022 856732 What the hell?
857149 859276 [Suspenseful music playing]
873832 874833 Something wrong?
875333 877586 Uh... just a little crash.
878170 880172 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
880672 883759 What a beautiful day to be alive.<br />Am I right?
884509 886386 - Problemo?<br />- He lost something.
887846 889014 Is this old matrix code?
891099 892684 A little modal experiment.
892851 894644 - For binary?<br />- [Cell phone chimes]
895854 898398 - I need a coffee.<br />- Coffee. Yes, stat!
898482 899566 I'm buying.
902778 904618 [Man] I'm not trying to<br />blow smoke up your ass,
904654 908241 but the first time I played the trilogy,<br />I was shook.
909117 911495 The paradox<br />between free will and destiny.
911661 914039 Are we all just algorithms<br />doing what we're supposed to do,
914247 915957 or can we escape our programming?
916124 919086 Genius, inside the context of the game,<br />bt dubs.
920087 922130 Hey, did I tell you<br />it took over my life?
922297 924591 Yeah. I failed the seventh grade.<br />[Chuckles]
925050 926384 Your game almost ruined me.
927302 929846 - So you've said.<br />- Yet here we are.
929930 932599 - [Cups clink]<br />- You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
932724 933725 is it free will
935018 936603 or destiny?
941274 942943 Oh, yeah.
943318 944736 There she is.
945320 946780 Total f-ing milf.
947739 949699 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
949991 952119 I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.
952285 953495 Maybe you should go.
953662 956540 No, please. I... I promise, best self.
956706 957916 Best self.
961837 963088 Sure.
964047 965382 You ever talk to her?
967551 968552 Tell you what.
968677 972931 For all you've done for me,<br />let me do this for you.
973515 975392 Jude, no. Stop.
976434 977936 - Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Thanks.
978103 979604 Hi. Um...
979771 982524 I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.<br />I'm Jude Gallagher.
983191 985569 I work for a game company<br />called deus machina.
985735 987028 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
987195 989990 Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.
990157 992075 - Mom loved Audrey hepburn.<br />- Jude.
992242 995996 Oh, and this is my very good friend,<br />Thomas Anderson.
996163 997914 He is a bona fide famous person
998081 999583 and considered by most to be
999666 1001459 the greatest game designer<br />of our generation.
1001626 1002794 I'm sorry about this.
1002961 1004230 - Jude_.<br />- [Softly] Just talk to her.
1004254 1006631 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me tiff.
1015932 1017017 Have we met?
1018560 1020687 Uh, we both come here.
1020854 1022373 - Can I have your morning bun?<br />- [Boy] Hey.
1022397 1023791 Are you trying to ball my mom or what?
1023815 1025108 - Brandon!<br />- [Chuckles]
1025192 1027027 [Boy 2] Can I have one bite?
1027194 1030030 Babe. What's going on?<br />We're gonna be late.
1030197 1032073 This is my husband, Chad.
1032240 1033909 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hey.
1035702 1037579 Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.
1037746 1039539 Right. Sorry. [Chuckles]
1039956 1041499 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1045420 1047005 [Soft music playing]
1065857 1066942 What?
1067025 1068860 [Keyboard clacking]
1070195 1071279 [Ominous music playing]
1074407 1076660 Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.
1082832 1085669 "Billions of people<br />just living out their lives,
1086920 1088713 oblivious."
1090757 1092509 I always loved that line.
1093218 1094594 You wrote that one, yeah?
1097389 1099140 Every time I stand here,
1099599 1102560 I mean, o-m-g.
1103019 1104938 It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.
1106106 1107399 - Right?<br />- [Chuckles softly]
1109276 1110527 Yeah.
1111319 1112445 Sure.
1112654 1114447 Have a seat.
1116199 1117409 [Man sighs]
1117492 1118660 Smoke?
1119995 1120996 I thought you quit.
1121955 1123415 I quit calling it a habit.
1124499 1126251 Now it's just a guilty pleasure.
1128586 1131339 Oh. Maybe I can make this easy for you.
1132215 1134301 I know binary is over budget.
1134467 1136547 This is not about binary, Tom.<br />It's bigger than that.
1136678 1138138 This is about our future,
1138221 1140432 which is a sticky subject,<br />given our past.
1141099 1142267 What do you mean?
1143435 1144728 How's the therapy?
1145061 1146354 Good.
1147063 1148523 Any...
1149524 1150817 Episodes?
1154362 1156114 That's terrific.
1158074 1160702 Look, Tom,<br />I know we've always had our differences.
1161578 1163330 What did you say<br />about our first meeting?
1163496 1166333 We had all the chemistry<br />of an FBI interrogation.
1166708 1167709 [Muffled yell]
1168209 1169294 [Scoffs]
1169377 1170712 But look at this place.
1171838 1173131 We did this.
1174507 1175717 Together.
1177093 1178470 Yeah.
1178636 1179846 Now what?
1180847 1183350 Things have changed. The market's tough.
1184559 1185769 I'm sure you can understand
1185852 1188188 why our beloved parent company,<br />Warner Bros.,
1188355 1190607 has decided to make a sequel<br />to the trilogy.
1190690 1191733 What?
1191900 1194100 They informed me<br />they're gonna do it with or without us.
1194361 1195862 I thought they couldn't do that.
1196112 1197197 [Exhales]
1197280 1198615 Oh, they can.
1198782 1199783 And they made it clear
1199866 1201868 they'll kill our contract<br />if we don't cooperate.
1202369 1203411 Really?
1204329 1207207 I know you said<br />the story was over for you,
1208291 1210293 but that's the thing about stories.
1212212 1213797 They never really end, do they?
1214339 1216758 We're still telling the same stories<br />we've always told,
1216925 1221012 just with different names,<br />different faces
1222806 1225725 and I have to say I'm kind of excited.
1228645 1229896 After all these years,
1229979 1232148 to be going back<br />to where it all started.
1232982 1235235 Back to the matrix.
1236444 1238238 I've spoken to marketing...
1238321 1242325 - [Sinister music playing]<br />- [Distorted voice]
1244119 1245203 [In normal voice] Tom?
1245662 1246704 Yeah.
1247372 1248373 Are you all right?
1248456 1249833 [Exhales nervously]
1250667 1251793 Yeah.
1256923 1258925 [Analyst] What were you feeling<br />at that point?
1262095 1263805 What was I feeling?
1267267 1271688 I felt either I'm having<br />a mental breakdown again
1272188 1276192 or I'm living inside<br />a computer-generated reality
1276359 1277819 that has imprisoned me...
1278486 1279612 Again.
1280363 1281573 [Laughs]
1283575 1284701 [Chuckles softly]
1290373 1291708 Not much of a choice.
1293334 1294836 Maybe it's not as binary as that.
1295003 1298131 Maybe there are other ways<br />to understand what happened.
1298715 1299757 Yeah.
1299924 1302135 Thomas, you are a suicide survivor
1302302 1305013 gifted with a powerful imagination.
1305180 1307015 Those facts have combined
1307098 1309517 to create dangerous fictions<br />in your life.
1309684 1312270 Yesterday, you walked into a meeting<br />with your business partner
1312437 1313605 and he ambushed you,
1313771 1316441 demanding you make a game<br />you said you would never make.
1316608 1319360 This attack<br />effectively took away your voice.
1320028 1322655 His violence triggered you<br />and your mind fought back.
1322822 1324532 You did to him<br />what he was doing to you.
1326159 1330330 We've talked about the value<br />of adaptive anger in healing trauma.
1331372 1334501 Far from suggesting<br />a repeat of your initial breakdown,
1334667 1337670 I believe this episode<br />demonstrates healthy self-protection.
1339422 1340590 And more importantly,
1340673 1343843 I remember how hard it was<br />for you to share something like this.
1344802 1347347 Which tells me just how far we've come.
1348806 1350225 [Chuckles softly]
1352644 1354687 Do you need a refill<br />on your prescription?
1354812 1356523 [Sighs]
1356606 1357774 Yeah.
1362779 1364030 [Pills rattle]
1368701 1370995 [Mysterious music playing]
1377961 1379128 [Grunts softly]
1380547 1382674 First of all,<br />I know I speak for everyone
1382840 1385093 when I say that I'm so, so excited
1385260 1388763 to be working on a game<br />that was such a, well, game changer.
1389514 1393726 Now, the packet in front of you<br />has our focus group research.
1393851 1395311 Inside, you'll find the breakdown,
1395478 1398398 including key word association<br />with the brand.
1398565 1401609 The top two<br />being "originality" and "fresh,"
1401776 1403653 which I think are great things<br />to keep in mind
1403861 1405905 as you begin working on matrix 4.
1407574 1409033 And who knows how many more?
1410785 1411953 [Alarm buzzing, stops]
1417709 1418918 [Singing indistinctly]
1424799 1427844 What made matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1428052 1429220 On point.
1429596 1431514 People want us up in their grey space,
1431681 1434183 switching their synaptic wtf light on.
1434726 1436936 ["White rabbit" playing]
1440398 1441816 [Man laughing]
1443943 1447113 What made matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1447280 1448948 People want us up in their grey space,
1449115 1450325 switching their synaptic
1450450 1453077 "what the hell is going on here?"<br />Light on.
1460001 1461502 [Panting]
1461586 1463129 [Shower running]
1463379 1467508 I didn't love the first one,<br />like some of you.
1467675 1470053 And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance
1470219 1472472 for anything that requires<br />a syllabus and a highlighter.
1472639 1474349 I like my games big, loud and dumb.
1474515 1476392 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1476559 1479062 Matrix means mayhem.
1479145 1481773 [Grunting]
1483858 1485943 Mindless action is not on-brand.
1486027 1487028 [Man] She's right.
1487195 1490531 Matrix is mind porn.<br />Philosophy in shiny,
1490698 1492241 - tight pvc.<br />- Yeah.
1492450 1494243 Ideas are the new sexy.
1496371 1498206 ["White rabbit" continues playing]
1508549 1510218 Obviously the matrix is about...
1510301 1512387 - Trans-politics.<br />- Crypto-fascism.
1512553 1513554 It's a metaphor...
1513638 1515181 Of capitalist exploitation.
1527860 1532031 This cannot be another reboot,<br />retread, regurgitated...
1532198 1534200 Why not? Reboots sell.
1537578 1539640 We are so far down<br />the wrong rabbit hole here, people.
1539664 1542709 You say matrix to anyone...<br />You say matrix...
1543501 1546379 [Echoing] Matrix... matrix... matrix...
1546546 1548381 This is what they see.<br />[Mimics explosion]
1548464 1550425 - [Guns firing]<br />- [Bullets whizzing]
1553594 1554637 [Clicks tongue]
1554721 1557181 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
1557348 1559434 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1560143 1561144 That's two words.
1565314 1568317 We need a new "bullet time." [Echoing]
1569569 1570987 [Laughs maniacally]
1571070 1574866 We need to revolutionize gaming again.
1575032 1578703 Revolutionize gaming again! [Echoing]
1581539 1583750 ["White rabbit" continues]
1604729 1606272 [Barista] Afternoon, tiff.
1606439 1607440 The ushe?
1607607 1609901 You know what, skroce? I'm going wild.
1610067 1611986 I'll have a cortado today.
1612612 1614447 Fly that freak flag.
1615239 1616866 Mind if I get that?
1617033 1618034 Oh, hi.
1621287 1623247 [Tiffany] I remember wanting a family,
1623790 1626834 but was that because<br />that's what women are supposed to want?
1628044 1629844 How do you know<br />if you want something yourself
1629879 1632423 or if your upbringing<br />programmed you to want it?
1635009 1639138 I pay my analyst a lot of money<br />to answer such questions for me.
1639597 1640807 Smart.
1640973 1644227 I should get more therapy<br />but honestly, I'm too goddamn tired.
1644811 1646437 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1648105 1650274 No. Never had kids.
1650441 1652902 Oh, right, I knew that.
1653361 1655655 - Sorry. I googled you.<br />- [Chuckles]
1657824 1660201 So, what's it like<br />being a world-famous game designer?
1660368 1662829 - Must be amazing.<br />- Uh...
1662954 1664372 A lot of hours.
1664539 1666499 Sometimes it is amazing.
1666666 1668125 Most times,
1669377 1670545 I don't know.
1670711 1673297 But you made the matrix.<br />Even I've heard of that.
1673464 1676384 Yeah. We kept some kids entertained.
1677301 1679303 - So, worth it?<br />- [Chuckles]
1685768 1688145 Can I ask something about your game?
1688312 1689522 Sure.
1689689 1691899 Did you base your main character<br />on yourself?
1697154 1699073 There is a lot of me in him.
1699198 1701075 [Indistinct shouting]
1701617 1704704 Maybe a little too much.
1706831 1708374 Can I ask you something else?
1708541 1709750 Please.
1711586 1713754 There's a woman in your game.
1714964 1715965 Trinity.
1717967 1720553 Which is a weird<br />coincidence also, right?
1722138 1723222 God, yeah.
1724640 1725850 I like her.
1727143 1728853 - I like Trinity.<br />- Ah.
1729520 1730730 And I dig her Ducati.
1730897 1733774 Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.
1735401 1736736 [Engine revs]
1737278 1739697 My friend kush and I<br />actually build them.
1739864 1740865 Really?
1740948 1743534 You have your analyst, I have my bikes.
1744785 1747496 So, I was looking at images<br />from your game.
1748164 1749165 At Trinity.
1750958 1754587 Well, I showed Chad a scene,<br />and I was like, "so, what do you think?"
1755796 1757632 He didn't get it until I said,
1758424 1760259 "don't you think she looks like me?"
1762178 1763804 You know what he did?
1765181 1766390 Helaughed.
1771270 1773981 And I laughed too, like it was a joke.
1774148 1775608 How could it not be, right?
1777860 1779445 Made me so angry.
1781072 1783282 I hated myself for laughing.
1785076 1788037 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1789372 1790456 Not too hard.
1790539 1793709 Maybe just hard enough<br />to break his jaw off.
1794043 1795169 [Chuckles]
1797338 1799048 And right now,<br />you're probably regretting
1799131 1800549 sitting down with me.
1802927 1806305 This is the best thing I've done<br />in a long time.
1806722 1808099 [Chuckles]
1809141 1810977 - [Cell phone ringing]<br />- [Gasps]
1811060 1812687 I have to take this.
1816357 1817358 Hi, this is tiff.
1817525 1818609 Oh, god, no.
1818693 1819777 [Gasps]
1820653 1822113 I'll be right there.
1822863 1825533 My... my, uh, youngest<br />stuck a lego up his nose.
1829161 1830162 I gotta go.
1832415 1834959 I hope I see you again.
1847847 1851600 [Alarm blaring]
1853102 1855582 [Announcer on speaker]<br />There has been a report of an emergency.
1855855 1859692 Proceed calmly to the nearest exit<br />and leave the building immediately.
1859859 1861110 What's going on?
1861277 1863197 We probably just got swatted<br />by some 14-year-old.
1863362 1864923 Yeah, someone pissed<br />about the latest update.
1864947 1865948 Or they're just a dick.
1866115 1869201 Please move to the exits.<br />Building's being evacuated.
1869285 1870536 [Cell phone buzzes]
1884341 1887011 [Suspenseful music playing]
1890473 1892058 [Security guard] Sir, this way.
1897897 1899065 Jude?
1900608 1901650 Jude!
1908115 1910076 At last.
1911952 1913329 [Chuckles] Ah.
1913412 1916540 I wasn't too sure about the callback,<br />but, you know, it was hard to resist.
1916874 1917917 What?
1918084 1919543 Morpheus uno. Reveal at the window.
1919710 1921962 Lightning, thunder and theater.
1922129 1923672 At last.
1924256 1928427 All these years later, here's me,<br />strolling out of a toilet stall.
1928969 1930012 Tragedy or farce?
1930179 1931847 I know you.
1932014 1933808 Not every day you meet your maker.
1933974 1935101 This can't be happening.
1935267 1936936 Oh, most definitely is.
1937103 1939355 You can't be a character I coded.
1939522 1941524 One hundred percent natural.
1947154 1948364 [Gasps softly]
1948989 1950032 How?
1950407 1952451 All the explanation you need.
1958666 1960543 No, no, no.
1960668 1962419 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />What do you mean, "no"?
1962586 1965172 You wanted this, you did this.<br />This was your idea.
1965256 1969385 [Hesitating] It was a test.<br />An experiment.
1970719 1971887 An experiment?
1973556 1975391 You put me in a tiny-ass modal,
1975558 1976725 left me to bang my head
1976809 1979145 till I nearly lost my shit<br />searching for you,
1979311 1980938 as an experiment.
1981105 1982999 - The exit's breaking down.<br />- He hasn't taken the pill.
1983023 1984358 What? There's no time.
1984525 1986193 I know, I know. He's having a moment.
1986735 1988655 Does he know<br />how hard it was to hack that mirror?
1989113 1991240 [Tense music playing]
1991323 1992366 Still open.
1993075 1996537 This... this can't be real.
1996704 1998384 [SWAT officer] Target acquired.<br />We got him.
2004545 2005921 [Grunting]
2006005 2007298 This isn't happening.
2007464 2009925 It's in my mind. It's in my mind.
2010092 2011692 [SWAT officer 2] Hey, you!<br />Stop! Hold it!
2013846 2015306 [All screaming]
2019018 2020769 [Groaning]
2027234 2028736 This can't be happening.
2030696 2031822 -[Gunshots] {933931
2031906 2033616 [SWAT officer 3] Freeze! Don't move!

2100808 2102935 [Shouts] Mr. Anderson!
2105145 2106146 It can't be.
2114989 2116782 I've missed you.
2123247 2124540 [Cat meows]
2127501 2129169 [Bell tinkling]
2132089 2133716 It's in my mind.
2134883 2136218 It's in my mind.
2142683 2143684 [Cup clinking]
2144518 2145894 [Analyst] Can you hear me, Thomas?
2147187 2149189 Follow my voice.
2150274 2153777 Feel the tips of your fingers.<br />What are they touching?
2153902 2155195 [Bell tinkling]
2155779 2157156 The bell.
2159742 2161076 Do you hear the bell?
2164705 2167541 Do you remember what happened?<br />How you got here?
2169251 2170461 You must have walked.
2170627 2173088 I heard d√©ja vu outside,<br />opened my door, and there you were.
2176967 2178010 [Thomas Anderson exhales]
2178594 2180804 You feel like you can talk about it?
2181513 2182782 When we started working together,
2182806 2187186 you had lost your capacity<br />to discern reality from fiction.
2187353 2190064 You came to me<br />after trying to jump off a building.
2190564 2192691 You said you wanted to fly away.
2195027 2197654 [Indistinct chatter]
2201992 2203327 [People shouting]
2206246 2208916 We have made<br />a lot of progress since then,
2209083 2211293 but you seem<br />particularly triggered right now.
2211460 2212753 Can you tell me how it started?
2214797 2216465 He texted me.
2217633 2218926 Who?
2219093 2220511 Morpheus.
2223430 2224765 So, he's back.
2224932 2227017 It wasn't actually him.
2228310 2230938 It was a program I coded for a modal.
2231688 2233732 And this modal, morpheus,
2233899 2236026 came to help you escape
2236110 2239530 from a virtual reality<br />called the matrix?
2249581 2250999 Am I crazy?
2251834 2253502 We don't use that word in here.
2254336 2256130 What word should I use?
2257464 2260467 What word explains<br />what is happening to me?
2260759 2262344 Can I see the texts?
2263303 2264763 [Exhales]
2264847 2266348 They were erased.
2271812 2274982 If we got in my car<br />and drove to your office,
2275149 2276900 what do you think we'd find there?
2277067 2278110 Nothing.
2280946 2282906 Because there was no attack.
2284158 2285701 No one was killed.
2286660 2288203 No one texted.
2288912 2290873 My mind made it all up.
2292458 2294543 Is that what I'm supposed to say?
2295127 2296545 Is that what you believe?
2297379 2298755 It felt real.
2299298 2300632 Of course.
2301341 2304261 It was your great ambition<br />to make a game
2304344 2306430 that was indistinguishable from reality.
2306680 2307681 To achieve this goal,
2307848 2310559 you converted elements of your life<br />into narrative.
2310934 2312936 Your sublimated anger toward<br />your business partner
2313103 2314730 cast him as your Nemesis.
2315397 2319902 A married woman named Tiffany<br />became the Trinity of a doomed romance.
2320694 2324031 Even your dislike of my cat<br />made it into your matrix.
2324865 2326492 There's nothing wrong with that.
2326658 2328118 It's what artists do.
2328285 2330245 But it becomes a problem
2330329 2333916 when fantasies<br />endanger us or other people.
2336335 2338504 We don't want anyone to get hurt,
2338670 2340005 do we, Thomas?
2348263 2350015 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me tiff.
2350474 2352392 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
2353018 2354662 [Oracle] No one can tell you<br />you're in love.
2354686 2356980 You just know it, through and through.
2357147 2359107 Balls to bones.
2359858 2361485 [Trinity whispers] You feel this?
2363278 2364905 I'm never letting go.
2365822 2366949 [Yells]
2367824 2368825 [Both grunting]
2372788 2374623 [Morpheus] You have to<br />let it all go, Neo.
2374790 2377084 Free your mind.
2382673 2383674 [Cell phone buzzing]
2384883 2385926 - [Buzzing stops]<br />- [Sighs]
2387052 2388220 [Pigeon cooing]
2395852 2396895 Huh.
2397479 2399398 Looks easy enough.
2404069 2405070 [Exhales]
2406321 2408865 "Free my mind." Shit.
2410742 2412411 [Suspenseful music playing]
2414037 2415497 Okay.
2416206 2417583 Free my mind.
2423672 2424673 [Grunts]
2433807 2435350 If iy...
2436310 2437728 Or I fall.
2438353 2439730 [Suspenseful music builds]
2441189 2442190 [Grunts]
2443609 2444818 [Both grunting]
2446069 2447237 Who the hell are you?
2448155 2450282 You won't remember me,
2450449 2452909 but a long time ago, you changed my life
2453744 2455621 when you leapt off another roof.
2456330 2459082 Back then,<br />I was just like any other coppertop,
2459166 2460584 pretending my life
2461001 2464296 until I looked up and I saw you.
2465255 2467591 It was a different you, but I saw
2468425 2469468 the real you,
2470302 2472012 just a second before...
2473513 2474598 Youleapt
2474681 2475807 [people shouting]
2479353 2481104 And you never fell.
2486568 2488570 Are you the one that hacked my modal?
2489154 2490238 Yeah.
2490322 2491573 [Cell phone buzzing]
2491698 2494451 That'll be Jude. He's not your friend.
2494534 2496294 He's a handle,<br />a program used to control you.
2496328 2499206 He's on his way here,<br />and he's bringing agents with him.
2500666 2501750 Jude.
2501917 2505212 Bro, I've been calling you all night.<br />We have a major problemo.
2506797 2508340 Are you alone?
2511301 2513220 That's kind of a sexy question, dude.
2514179 2516348 [Bugs] They don't look like<br />typical agents.
2516515 2517909 They use bots now,<br />skinned as normal people,
2517933 2520602 which means they're everywhere<br />and you never know who to trust.
2521478 2523146 Why should I trust you?
2525440 2528360 Because if they open that door,<br />we lose our hack.
2528527 2530112 I will be caught and killed
2530278 2532799 and you will be put right back<br />on that treadmill they designed for you
2532823 2535343 just like they did the last time<br />you tried to leap your way out.
2536702 2539079 I know why you left your modal open.
2539246 2541373 You needed someone else<br />to free morpheus.
2541873 2543851 And it's because of him<br />that we were able to get to you.
2543875 2547546 I know these things the same way<br />that I knew one day I would find you.
2548714 2551133 And that when I did,<br />you would be ready for this.
2555846 2557097 If you want the truth, Neo,
2558515 2560350 you're going to have to follow me.
2561893 2562894 Okay.
2566189 2567941 [Dramatic music playing]
2580454 2582456 [Upbeat music playing]
2582539 2585167 - Where are we?<br />- Tokyo.
2585333 2587085 A moving portal<br />makes it harder to track us.
2587252 2589629 - Seq is the best of them.<br />- [Seq] Portal's clean.
2589796 2591173 Reading no shadows.
2592758 2594342 I don't remember this.
2595510 2597596 We don't have to run<br />to phone booths anymore either.
2597721 2599765 [Upbeat music playing]
2607230 2608607 Door's on your right.
2610484 2611526 [Door opens]
2622913 2625165 Set and setting, right?
2625332 2626583 Oh, no.
2626750 2628126 It's all about set...
2629002 2630295 And setting.
2630462 2634466 After our first contact went so badly,<br />we thought elements from your past
2634633 2636113 might help ease you into the present.
2636176 2638845 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2639012 2640472 a little nostalgia.
2640639 2642808 This is footage from your game.
2650190 2652025 [Morpheus] Time is always against us,
2652984 2654945 etcetera, etcetera.
2656196 2660659 No one can be told what the matrix is,<br />blah, blah, blah.
2663370 2665205 You gotta see it to believe it.
2668875 2669876 Time to fly.
2670585 2671878 [Suspenseful music playing]
2672462 2673880 Wait.
2674047 2675048 If this is real,
2675215 2677968 if I haven't lost my mind,<br />does that mean
2679719 2681054 this happened?
2682013 2684641 [Soft music playing]
2689938 2691523 But if it did,
2695694 2697153 then we died.
2697320 2699239 Obviously not.
2699406 2700824 Why the machines kept you alive
2700991 2703743 and why they went<br />to such lengths to hide you
2703910 2705495 are questions we don't have answers to.
2705662 2706955 Hide me?
2707581 2711209 I've been at a company making<br />a game called the matrix.
2711918 2714421 Doesn't seem like<br />they were trying to hide anything.
2714588 2716148 We've been tracking<br />that company for years.
2716172 2718800 We screened<br />every Thomas Anderson we found.
2718967 2722679 What we didn't understand<br />was that they could alter your dsi.
2723305 2725056 Pods generate your digital self-image
2725140 2727559 through a feedback system<br />called semblance.
2727726 2729102 This is how you look to yourself.
2729853 2732731 Somehow they were able<br />to alter your dsi loop.
2733607 2735483 This is how everyone else sees you.
2736109 2738653 [Suspenseful music playing]
2750081 2752000 Twenty years?
2753460 2756922 Why did it take 20 years to find me?
2757088 2758882 It took a lot longer than that.
2759049 2761009 It's been over 60 years<br />since you and Trinity
2761092 2762677 flew to one of the machine cities.
2763386 2764387 What?
2764554 2766264 There's so much we don't know.
2766806 2768642 Like why you've barely aged,
2768725 2770852 or how many times<br />they've altered your dsi.
2771019 2772371 [Morpheus] But based on what we do know,
2772395 2775231 it appears no one found you<br />because you didn't want to be found.
2775774 2778109 - That's not true.<br />- [Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.
2778526 2780966 Maybe there's no foundation<br />to the rumors that you disappeared
2781071 2782590 because you were<br />working with the machines
2782614 2783615 from the beginning.
2783782 2784950 Morpheus, stop.
2785116 2788161 All I'm saying is this is the moment
2788328 2790664 for you to show us what is real.
2790830 2792624 If you want out,
2793166 2794459 you'll take this pill.
2796086 2798338 But if you are where you belong,
2798505 2800590 you can go back to this.
2800757 2802050 Every day.
2802217 2805762 Over and over, forever.
2809224 2810433 Fuck.
2812268 2815772 [Dramatic music playing]
2820568 2821653 [Seq] Keep the loop tight.
2834249 2835434 [Bugs] Cybebe needs that tower pin.
2835458 2837210 I got a signal. It's faint.
2837377 2838753 It's definitely off-grid.
2845844 2848096 Captain. I'm tracking<br />a whole lot of weird.
2848263 2849597 - What?<br />- It's some kind of graft.
2855854 2857147 Thomas?
2858314 2860108 Oh, god.
2860734 2862235 Oh, no.
2863945 2865947 - We got company.<br />- How'd they find us?
2867365 2870285 Thomas, none of this is real.
2870452 2873663 You are in the midst<br />of a serious psychotic break.
2874581 2876499 - Lexy?<br />- Almost there.
2876666 2877876 Thomas?
2879002 2881629 Thomas, please. This is not a game.
2881796 2883256 Feel my hand.
2883423 2884549 This is what is real.
2887594 2889137 Stay with me.
2889512 2891056 [Thomas Anderson] No. No.
2894100 2895244 [Analyst, distorted] Stay with me.
2895268 2896686 [Distorted grunts]
2902525 2903526 Morpheus!
2905195 2906488 [Morpheus] Let's go, let's go!
2923296 2925507 [People screaming]
2931638 2933014 [Woman screaming]
2937060 2938978 - Bots are being activated.<br />- It's a swarm.

2952075 2953326 [Woman screams]

2984983 2986609 [Whimpers]
2993408 2994993 [Shrieking]
2997829 2999223 I got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry.
2999247 3000248 Yes.
3001040 3002041 Come on!
3004127 3005128 Seq, where?
3007338 3010425 - That mirror.<br />- What? We'll never fit.
3010508 3012236 You gotta fit, 'cause I don't have<br />another way off this train.
3012260 3013860 - [Groans]<br />- [Morpheus] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3014345 3015847 I know. I know.
3016014 3018975 Think perspective.<br />Closer you are, bigger it gets.
3022562 3024189 Okay, come on.
3025481 3026691 In you go.

3230228 3233022 [Echoing] Welcome back<br />to the real world.
3241572 3242657 Trinity.
3242824 3243699 What's up, doc?
3243783 3245636 [Woman] His vital systems<br />have been meticulously maintained,
3245660 3247453 but it doesn't look good.
3250623 3252041 [EKG beeping]
3253000 3255211 - We're losing him.<br />- Cold boot could shock him.
3255795 3256796 Do it.
3257046 3258464 [Computer buzzing rapidly]
3259757 3260757 [Groans]
3261843 3262844 [Exhales]
3269976 3271436 I remember this.
3274147 3275648 The construct.
3276524 3279026 In between everything
3279193 3280653 and nothing.
3281446 3283030 Welcome to the crib.
3284824 3286659 I've been chilling here<br />in the ship network,
3290121 3291664 learning all about you.
3294542 3295793 [TV static]
3296377 3297503 And me.
3301466 3304010 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3305428 3308806 Are memories turned into fiction<br />any less real?
3312185 3315313 Is reality based in memory<br />nothing but fiction?
3315480 3317106 As to my role in all this,
3317190 3319775 my best guess is that you wrote me
3319859 3322069 as an algorithmic reflection<br />of two forces
3322236 3324363 that helped you become you,
3324822 3327742 morpheus and agent Smith.
3328326 3331996 A combo pack of counterprogramming<br />that was...
3332079 3333080 [Inhales]
3334999 3337668 Let's just say,<br />more than a little bit crazy-making.
3338878 3341631 But it worked because here we are.
3342757 3344300 Now, for the bad news.
3344467 3346677 Your brain is hooked on this shit
3346844 3349472 the matrix has been force-feeding you<br />for years.
3349639 3351349 Hooked bad.
3351516 3353076 You're going through major withdrawals.
3353142 3355478 Docbots are giving you crap odds<br />for surviving.
3356395 3358481 But, see, they don't know you like I do.
3361442 3363569 I know exactly what you need.
3365404 3367114 [Lively music playing]
3385508 3386926 You gotta be kidding.
3387218 3388261 Uh-uh.
3389262 3390555 Nojoke.
3391389 3394642 Could be this is the first day<br />of the rest of your life.
3395434 3397186 But if you want it...
3398521 3399564 [Water splashing]
3400898 3402149 You gotta fight for it.
3403359 3406237 No. I'm done fighting.
3407280 3408281 Are you?

3454327 3456996 Oh, yeah. They taught you good.
3459957 3461208 [Neo grunting]
3462668 3465796 Made you believe<br />their world was all you deserved.
3465963 3467840 But some part of you knew<br />that was a lie.
3468007 3470551 Some part of you<br />remembered what was real.
3473346 3474472 You don't know me.
3476265 3477308 [Both grunting]

3518891 3519809 I know you,
3519892 3522092 because I know the only thing<br />that still matters to you.
3522770 3525147 I know it's why you're here,<br />why you're still fighting
3525898 3527400 and why you will never give up.
3527483 3528776 [Both grunting]
3537243 3538703 [Neo groaning]
3539370 3541497 - [Whimpering]<br />- [EKG beeping]
3541580 3542873 Come on, Neo!
3544333 3545501 This is it.
3547712 3549088 This is your last chance.

3551215 3552717 [Emotional music playing]
3554510 3555886 [Groaning]
3557346 3560146 You gotta fight for your goddamn life<br />if you want to see Trinity again.
3560182 3561851 [Neo groaning]
3565062 3566355 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3569108 3571610 - Holy shit.<br />- Fight for her!

3587168 3588169 [Gasps]
3597553 3598554 [Sighs]
3623746 3625372 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3627333 3628793 Mind if I...
3642014 3643474 How are you doing?
3645142 3647144 If this plug is actually real,
3649230 3651440 that means they took my life...
3652525 3653734 [Scoffs]
3654151 3656362 And turned it into a video game.
3659573 3661116 How am I doing?
3662117 3663410 I don't know.
3664328 3666372 I don't even know how to know.
3667540 3668958 That's it, isn't it?
3670584 3672670 If we don't know what's real,
3674797 3675881 we can't resist.
3678884 3680261 They took your story,
3680427 3681846 something that meant
3683013 3685182 so much to people like me,
3686976 3689478 and turned it into something trivial.
3691355 3693065 That's what the matrix does.
3693983 3696110 It weaponizes every idea.
3696902 3698279 Every dream.
3699947 3701574 Everything that's important to us.
3704285 3705369 Where better to Bury truth
3705452 3708914 than inside something<br />as ordinary as a video game?
3709665 3711584 That sounds like the oracle.
3711667 3712710 [Bugs chuckles]
3713043 3714753 Heard so much about her.
3717673 3719091 She was gone before I was free.
3720759 3721760 Gone?
3721927 3725055 When this new version of the matrix<br />was uploaded,
3726640 3728100 there was a purge.
3730895 3732062 [Sighs]
3733188 3736734 They promised peace<br />and they gave us purge.
3739778 3741447 No, there was peace.
3743073 3747244 You made it possible,<br />and it changed everything.
3748203 3750873 Doesn't feel like it changed anything.
3751832 3754335 The matrix is the same or worse.
3755085 3757171 And I'm back where I started.
3760049 3762384 It feels like everything I did,
3763469 3764929 everything we did...
3769016 3770017 [Both grunt]
3771060 3773145 Like none of it mattered.
3775439 3777024 All of it mattered.
3778817 3780277 I can show you.
3790996 3792539 This is my crew.
3795751 3797836 Our operator, seq.
3800214 3803550 Sequoia. But everybody calls me seq.
3804051 3805469 Nice to meet you.
3806595 3808097 Dad loved redwoods.
3808722 3811600 When he escaped the matrix<br />and found out they no longer existed,
3811684 3812768 it almost killed him.
3813227 3814395 Lucky he met mom,
3815312 3816397 and here I am.
3817106 3820693 This is lexy, berg and ellster.
3822778 3825280 You knew my grandfather, captain Roland.
3825447 3827783 Roland was your grandfather?
3828617 3830777 He always laughed,<br />joking how he never believed in you.
3831912 3835040 But, in private, he said<br />that you freed his mind a second time.
3835666 3837751 Uh, not to fanboy out here,
3837835 3839753 but this is kind of<br />a huge moment for me.
3839920 3841797 Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.
3842339 3843632 A what?
3843799 3846844 There's a lot of people<br />out there like me
3846927 3849138 who are a little bit obsessed<br />with your life.
3849304 3851741 I would never have recognized your modal<br />if it weren't for him.
3851765 3854977 Whenever you're feeling up for it,<br />I've got, like, a million questions.
3855144 3857479 Me too. Starting with them.
3858856 3859857 [Bugs] It's okay.
3860649 3861650 Come meet him.
3861984 3863193 This is cybebe.
3863360 3864778 That's octacles.
3864945 3866947 - That's lumin8.<br />- [Chittering]
3867698 3869825 Machines are on our side now?
3869992 3872953 They are synthients.<br />It's a word they prefer to machines.
3873120 3876457 Your contact with the synthient city<br />had a huge impact on their world.
3876915 3877995 [Bugs] That's what I meant.
3878042 3880961 What you changed that nobody believed<br />could ever be changed.
3883005 3885132 The meaning of "our side."
3885549 3886884 [Cybebe warbling softly]
3889344 3892264 Cybebe and octacles risked their lives<br />to help get you out.
3893724 3894725 Thank you.
3896268 3897269 But why?
3897352 3899104 [Morpheus] Not all seek to control.
3900147 3902024 Just as not all wish to be free.
3903859 3904943 What is that?
3905110 3907529 An exomorphic-particle codex.<br />It's pretty new.
3907696 3910783 It gives programs access to this world.<br />Within limits.
3910949 3913952 Limits are the domain of the limited.
3914119 3915204 Morpheus.
3915746 3916747 Thank you.
3916914 3918290 It was my honor.
3920167 3921418 [Chuckles] Wow.
3921585 3922729 - [Crew chuckles]<br />- How does it work?
3922753 3924129 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3924296 3926673 If you want,<br />I can download the codex manual for you.
3926840 3929093 - Sure.<br />- Downloading used to be fun.
3929510 3931386 Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.
3931887 3933514 Can I ask them something?
3936642 3939561 When you unplugged me,<br />there was another pod?
3939812 3941063 [Warbling softly]
3941146 3943899 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3945150 3946443 It could be Trinity.
3947319 3948529 It's her.
3949154 3951573 I figured we were going to<br />have this conversation.
3952282 3955160 Look, you were not<br />a typical flush-and-grab.
3955327 3957746 You were in this weird tower<br />that cybebe had never accessed,
3957830 3958997 and she's now exiled.
3959164 3961208 We burned our one shot for you.
3961750 3963686 Even if it were Trinity<br />and she wanted to be free,
3963710 3965587 we have no idea how to do it.
3965754 3966755 Yet.
3969341 3971552 Nobody believed we'd ever find him,
3972177 3973178 but we did.
3975597 3976723 Okay.
3977766 3980727 We don't know how to get her out... yet.
3982980 3985440 Captain, we're approaching<br />security clearance.
3986775 3987776 We're here.
3988026 3989027 Zion?
3997161 3998287 Have a seat.
3998787 4001415 This is hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.
4001582 4003917 Quite a few synthients<br />deserve that title before me.
4004084 4005770 [Control on radio]<br />Mnemosyne, you are cleared for landing.
4005794 4006794 Welcome home.
4006879 4008463 [Hanno] Thank you, control.
4008630 4010132 Um, we're about to crash.
4011175 4013051 [Dramatic music playing]
4015846 4017055 [Chuckles]
4017139 4020517 General realized we were never going to<br />beat the sentinels,
4020684 4022644 so we just got better at<br />hiding from them.
4027274 4028817 Welcome to lo.
4032029 4033739 [Sweeping music playing]
4038368 4041038 Wow. That looks real.
4041538 4043123 Bio-sky.
4046835 4048545 Works kind of like grow lights.
4049296 4050923 It's way more complex than that.
4051089 4053467 It pulls water from the crust,<br />hydronating the air.
4053634 4056762 It balances the eco and our Sri cycles.
4057888 4059181 Plus... [sighs]
4060057 4061767 It is pretty to look at.
4061934 4063685 As opposed to that.
4065145 4067564 I guess the general<br />sent us a welcome party.
4085832 4087251 God damn.
4088377 4089544 It is you.
4090420 4091588 Niobe?
4093590 4096343 A few more wrinkles<br />and a few less teeth,
4097302 4100847 but wise enough to know<br />I don't know anything.
4101014 4103517 I sure as shit never saw this coming.
4104393 4105477 Neither did I.
4105644 4106770 I told you he was alive.
4106937 4109064 Captain, you and your crew<br />have been grounded.
4109231 4110667 General, if you'd just let me explain.
4110691 4113485 The protocols are put in place<br />for everyone's protection.
4113652 4116947 I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity<br />and I was afraid we'd lose him.
4117114 4119658 But, general,<br />people have been waiting for so long.
4121368 4122577 We found the one.
4124496 4126123 I don't believe in the one.
4128417 4129501 I never did.
4132379 4133714 Me neither.
4134047 4138593 But there was a time<br />when you trusted me with your ship,
4139303 4141013 against the council's orders.
4141179 4143140 The world was different then.
4145058 4146601 We were different.
4148729 4150063 Report to the docks.
4150230 4151857 Scrub down the mnemosyne.
4152024 4154192 Transfer your access codes.
4154359 4155777 You are done, captain.
4155861 4156862 [Gasps softly]
4165454 4167247 We need to talk.
4172544 4174713 [Niobe] When word first came,
4175339 4177466 that it actually might be you,
4181428 4185015 I didn't know how I would feel<br />in this moment.
4192981 4194941 It is nice to see you.
4195108 4197652 - It's good to see you too.<br />- [Glasses clink]
4203700 4206370 A long way from dozer's paint stripper.
4206453 4208872 [Chuckles] Yes.
4209498 4211166 A lot has changed.
4212751 4214628 Except maybe you.
4217506 4218965 You remember this?
4226223 4230769 It's so easy to forget how much noise<br />the matrix pumps into your head
4230936 4232312 until you unplug.
4232813 4234064 [Neo sighs]
4234147 4235190 Yeah.
4235816 4238568 Something else<br />makes the same kind of noise.
4238735 4240821 Takes over every damn thing
4240987 4242614 just like the matrix.
4244282 4245283 War.
4247160 4249621 I stood at the barricade of the temple.
4251581 4253708 Staring at the army of sentinels,
4254960 4257462 waiting for them to kill<br />every one of us.
4259005 4262008 But then, they left.
4263301 4265637 They said you saved us.
4265804 4267013 I didn't believe it.
4267180 4270350 Every night I would dream<br />of attack sirens.
4271017 4272269 But then,
4274938 4277065 I would wake up to this...
4281069 4282529 Shence.
4286074 4287659 I'm ashamed of it now.
4287826 4291705 My pessimism<br />of how long it took me to believe
4291872 4294958 a world without war was possible.
4296418 4297961 You gave me that.
4298545 4300881 You gave that gift to us all.
4301631 4305093 And it is the gift<br />that continues to bear fruit.
4307888 4309556 Come help me get up.
4309723 4311349 Let's take a walk.
4311766 4314686 [Mysterious music playing]
4324446 4325906 [Elevator door opens]
4335540 4337501 Oh! Beautiful.
4338710 4341671 This is Freya, head of botany.
4341838 4344841 And this is quillion,<br />our lead digitologist.
4345175 4349095 I presume<br />our guest needs no introduction.
4349262 4351723 Nothing travels faster than light.
4351890 4353141 Except gossip.
4353225 4354226 [Freya chuckles]
4355560 4356895 Welcome to the garden, Neo.
4358980 4360190 A strawberry?
4360357 4364361 Using digital code from the matrix,<br />we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.
4364528 4365987 And they grow here?
4366154 4370325 It's not easy augmenting the genome<br />to photosynthesize bio-sky, but...
4370492 4372077 - We're getting there.<br />- [Chuckles]
4372869 4374538 Go ahead. Try it.
4380710 4382003 [Niobe chuckles]
4382087 4384339 We're quite excited<br />about the blueberries.
4384506 4386299 You remember that shit we used to eat?
4386466 4388718 That slop that tasted like rust.
4390512 4393848 Zion could have never<br />made something like this.
4395809 4398061 Because we needed synthients
4398436 4400480 and di like him.
4400647 4403858 Zion was stuck in the past.<br />Stuck in war.
4404025 4406069 Stuck in a matrix of its own.
4406570 4410240 They believed<br />that it had to be us or them.
4410407 4413243 This city was built by us
4413410 4415078 and them.
4420834 4422419 What happened to Zion?
4422586 4425797 I've been waiting<br />for you to ask that question.
4428008 4431344 All of the troubles<br />started in the machine cities.
4431511 4434764 Power plants were unable<br />to produce enough energy.
4435307 4438852 Nothing can breed violence<br />like scarcity.
4440645 4442272 For the first time,
4442439 4445483 we saw machines at war with one another.
4448737 4452490 We got word from the oracle<br />of a new power rising.
4454618 4457120 That was the last we heard from her.
4460832 4462000 Morpheus.
4462167 4466630 [Niobe] After the siege,<br />he was elected unanimously.
4466796 4468798 High chair of the council.
4469799 4472802 Oh, how he loved that. [Scoffs]
4473345 4477349 But as rumors of this new power spread,
4477515 4478725 he ignored them.
4478892 4483271 He was certain what you had done<br />could not be undone.
4483938 4487609 All of these people<br />never stopped believing in miracles,
4487776 4490111 believing in you.
4502207 4503541 I'm sorry.
4505543 4507921 How could I know this would happen?
4508088 4510173 We didn't understand<br />all of it back then.
4510340 4511966 No more than we do now.
4512384 4515470 I didn't come here<br />to cause you problems, niobe,
4516596 4518264 but I need your help.
4519974 4521434 Trinity is alive.
4521601 4523228 Then there is another question.
4523395 4525063 Why did they keep her alive?
4525230 4526439 I can't answer that.
4526606 4529818 But if there's a chance I can free her,
4529984 4531653 I have to try.
4531820 4535490 Even if it means<br />endangering everyone in this city?
4539786 4541121 I'm sorry, Neo.
4541746 4545208 I won't let what happened to Zion<br />happentolo.
4547168 4550839 I hope you'll forgive an old woman<br />for asking you to go with Sheperd here,
4551798 4554259 till we have better understanding<br />of what's going on.
4554926 4557762 You're going to imprison me<br />after I just got free?
4557929 4560807 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4561808 4563810 but neither does growing old.
4564769 4566730 But you don't hear me complaining.
4569566 4571025 [Elevator whirring]
4578742 4579826 Sorry.
4580785 4582704 I've never met a legend before.
4586082 4587167 Neo.
4588585 4589669 Sheperd. [Breathes shakily]
4590378 4591546 [Chuckles in disbelief]
4591629 4593423 Crazy. You're real.
4595383 4596509 "Real."
4597635 4599596 There's that word again.
4605310 4607150 [Sheperd] People talk a lot<br />about the old days.
4607645 4609773 About you, the viral agent.
4609939 4611566 The siege of Zion.
4612776 4614611 Everything was simpler back then.
4615695 4617197 People wanted to be free.
4619324 4620617 It's different now.
4621451 4624746 Sometimes it feels like people gave up.
4626080 4627165 Like the matrix won.
4627832 4629083 [Unlocks door]
4630543 4631920 This is you.
4636007 4638218 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4640345 4641971 Is it true you could fly?
4646810 4647811 Cool.
4652857 4654067 [Locks door]
4667539 4668873 [Finckfing]
4677257 4678299 [Morpheus grunts]
4678383 4679467 Morpheus.
4679676 4682637 Oh. General stuck you<br />in the rapunzel tower.
4684013 4685139 [Morpheus exhales]
4685223 4686724 On the upside, it's a nice view.
4686891 4688935 What happened to bugs and the others?
4689102 4691813 They're supposed to be sterilizing<br />the mnemosyne with a toothbrush.
4691896 4692896 "Supposed to be"?
4693022 4694416 Well, I could tell you<br />that they're standing by,
4694440 4697569 waiting for you to make the choice<br />to remain meekly incarcerated
4697735 4699863 or bust the hell out of here<br />and go and find Trinity.
4701531 4702532 But that ain't a choice.
4704534 4706870 [Dramatic music playing]
4715336 4717297 [Sheperd] General, what should we do?
4720925 4723386 [Freya] Bugs has the same<br />independence of mind
4723469 4724929 she had the day you freed her.
4725096 4727891 This is not independence of mind.
4728057 4729058 It's mutiny.
4730476 4731477 [Freya] Come on, 'be.
4731895 4734814 I know how much you hated<br />locking him up.
4734981 4737609 Just like I know there's a part of you
4737775 4740653 that's relieved now that he's gone.
4742280 4745950 We've worked so hard to keep lo safe.
4748745 4750330 This scares me.
4760924 4762175 That's her.
4762342 4763384 [Seq] On the bridge.
4763885 4764928 Got her.
4771726 4773645 [Engine revving]
4773728 4775939 It's sick how the semblance works.
4776105 4777607 You see flashes of the real her,
4777774 4780401 but the way she reads...
4782278 4784739 Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.
4786824 4789702 This is a tough question, Neo,<br />but it has to be asked.
4790995 4792997 What if she's happy where she is?
4794540 4795708 How did I read?
4797835 4799712 Exactly like her.
4803591 4805259 Take us to broadcast depth.
4805885 4808221 [Suspenseful music playing]
4817105 4818481 Thank you for helping me.
4820274 4822110 Most of us are here because of you.
4824862 4827448 I also admit our only chance<br />to get out of the general's doghouse
4827615 4829117 is for you to find your mojo.
4830952 4833413 What if I can't be what I once was?
4835123 4836684 - Then we're all fucked.<br />- [Signal beeps]
4836708 4838042 [Hanno] Two minutes.
4838209 4839502 Two minutes to broadcast.
4848886 4850114 [Seq] I slipped you in<br />through a hotel room.
4850138 4851848 [Seq chuckles]
4851931 4853307 Should be safe.
4864152 4865278 Portal's open.
4865445 4867685 Closest I could get you<br />is the warehouse near her garage.
4868072 4869449 Whole zone's crawling with bots.
4870825 4872368 Let's go.
4899729 4901355 So, what do you think of him?
4903066 4905610 I was kinda worried at first<br />because he's so much older.
4905777 4908321 The beard, the hair... oh.
4908488 4911115 - No, totally works for me.<br />- [Scoffs] You idiot.
4911866 4913159 I mean "the one" thing.
4915036 4917413 You know, everyone that<br />shipped with him died.
4918081 4920666 Oh, yeah. He's gonna<br />get us all killed for sure.
4924212 4925213 [Guns cocking]
4926089 4927590 Predictable as ever.
4929842 4931219 Smith.
4931761 4933679 Smith? As in, the Smith?
4934097 4935098 [Chuckles]
4942230 4943314 This is so insane.
4943481 4944875 There's so many theories<br />about the two of them
4944899 4946526 and they're standing right there.
4946692 4948236 This code is freaky.
4948402 4951155 He's like an agent, but not.
4955409 4956911 An appeal to reason.
4961207 4962708 How did you find us?
4962875 4965002 You never appreciated our relationship.
4965795 4967130 Not like the analyst.
4967296 4969215 - The what?<br />- My doctor.
4969382 4973010 He used our bond<br />and turned it into a chain.
4973177 4974737 It's so obvious once you see it, right?
4974804 4977640 But this whole altered-code update<br />really blew my mind.
4978391 4980226 I still don't know how he did it.
4980393 4982603 You, as a balding nerd.
4983229 4984438 Hilarious.
4985064 4986899 And me... [sighs]
4987525 4989360 Even more perfect.
4990444 4992339 Maybe a little too far<br />on the piercing blue eyes.
4992363 4993614 What do you think?
4994407 4996284 What do you want, Smith?
4998494 5002123 I have such dreams, Tom. Big dreams.
5002874 5005459 Well, mostly just extremely violent<br />revenge fantasies,
5005626 5006854 but in order for me to pursue mine,
5006878 5009088 I need to dissuade you<br />from pursuing yours.
5009172 5012717 Hmm. Sounds like conflict.
5014468 5015970 Inevitable?
5017263 5018598 Doesn't have to be.
5018764 5020892 All you have to do<br />is stay out of the matrix,
5020975 5022435 and leave the good doctor to me.
5022602 5024729 You can have him. I'm here for Trinity.
5024896 5026439 That's the trouble, Tom.
5026606 5028858 He knew you'd come, just like I did.
5029192 5030776 [Scoffs]
5030860 5032069 Trust me.
5033112 5034447 You're not ready for him.
5034614 5037450 Captain, I'm reading portals<br />from the lower frequencies.
5042914 5045917 I won't have his leash on my neck again.
5053591 5055635 I found some old acquaintances of yours.
5056761 5060056 - Bugs!<br />- [Growling]
5065561 5066729 [Ominous music playing]
5071192 5072276 [Snarls]
5073778 5074820 Exiles.
5074904 5076131 I thought they were all purged.
5076155 5077240 [Man] You?
5077740 5078866 [Excitedly] Oh!
5078950 5080910 It is you!
5081410 5082495 [Man speaking French]
5082578 5086165 All these years. I can't believe it.
5086832 5088459 Oh, god.
5088626 5092505 You stole my life!
5092672 5094465 [Speaking French]
5097510 5098987 [In English] What the merv<br />is trying to say is that
5099011 5101472 their situation<br />is a little bit like mine.
5101639 5103683 To have their lives back,<br />yours has to end.
5105309 5106686 [Bullet whizzing]
5107353 5108354 Kill him!
5108604 5110273 [Tense music playing]
5114151 5115152 [Blade slicing]
5116320 5117822 [All grunting]
5121701 5124161 You ruined
5124328 5127290 every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5127456 5130001 We had grace.
5135089 5136590 We had style!
5136757 5138759 We had conversation!
5138926 5140761 Not this... [mimics text message sound]
5140845 5142471 [All grunting]
5153190 5154317 - [Bone cracks]<br />- [Yells]
5165411 5168789 Art, films, books were all better!
5168956 5172126 Originality mattered!
5172293 5174170 You gave us face-zucker-suck
5174337 5177631 and<br />couch-flix-climatey-wiki-piss-and-shit!
5198402 5199612 [Screams]
5207453 5209121 [Screaming]
5210039 5211832 [Ominous music builds]
5222259 5223260 [Man groans]
5223844 5225346 I still know kung fu.
5229225 5230393 [Smith yells]
5239610 5240861 [Both grunting]
5258003 5259422 Just like old times.
5264176 5265511 [Tense music playing]
5285781 5286907 [Neo groaning]
5290619 5291912 [Woman shrieks]
5298586 5299837 [Man yelling]
5317062 5318105 Neo.
5320191 5322193 I've been thinking about us, Tom.
5322985 5326071 About binaries that form<br />the nature of things.
5327406 5328657 Ones and zeros.
5328741 5329825 [Grunting]
5329909 5330951 Light and dark.
5333162 5335164 Choice and its absence.
5335247 5336290 [Smith grunts]
5338584 5340753 Anderson and Smith.
5342880 5344507 [Dramatic music playing]
5375371 5376413 [Gasps]
5377498 5379583 You've lost something, Tom.
5383712 5385381 You're not what you used to be.
5386674 5387716 It's true.
5391971 5393138 [Grunts]
5396934 5398310 [Jaw cracks]
5401146 5403065 - Nice one.<br />- Thanks.
5410948 5412116 Come on, Neo.
5427089 5429049 [Neo groaning]
5432595 5433679 [Panting]
5434680 5435723 [Gasps]
5437141 5439226 Captain. You okay?
5439768 5442021 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5442813 5443856 Smith is killing him.
5444023 5445190 [Bugs] Where?
5445482 5446734 [Neo groaning]
5452948 5454867 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5457661 5459580 After all,<br />you are the one who set me free...
5460873 5461874 Again.
5464001 5466712 So you, more than anyone,<br />understands why I can't go back.
5467671 5468672 [Grunts]
5469465 5471091 You should have listened to me.
5473427 5475054 Now you'll never see her again.
5476555 5477598 [Grunts]
5479725 5481018 [Yells]
5481185 5482227 [Energy explodes]
5488692 5489777 What was that?
5489943 5491278 That was Neo.
5492946 5493989 Mojo rising.
5494073 5495240 [Lumin8 chittering]
5495324 5496408 [Seq exclaims]
5502039 5503332 [Bugs] You all right?
5503499 5504500 Yeah.
5505209 5507649 - It's gonna trigger a response.<br />- I got multiple exits ready.
5507711 5509271 [The merovingian] This is not over yet!
5509296 5511799 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5512007 5514176 [Speaking French]
5514510 5515511 [Spits]
5519014 5520265 [Bugs] We should go.
5520432 5521600 I can't.
5521767 5523686 I have to talk to her.
5523852 5527106 Neo, those exiles were older than you,<br />and we barely handled them.
5527981 5529149 [Sighs]
5530776 5532236 You really wanna do this now?
5537658 5538867 I mean...
5542913 5544289 You look like shit.
5544581 5546834 [Buzzing]
5555843 5558220 Oh, my god. What? What happened?
5558387 5559471 An accident.
5559638 5561849 [Tiffany] Kush. Call a doctor.
5562015 5563517 It's fine.
5564518 5566145 I don't have a lot of time.
5566812 5568397 I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5568564 5571024 After we spoke, I realized
5571942 5573944 my life wasn't a life.
5575529 5580492 At some point, I think I gave up<br />searching for something real.
5586832 5588125 Wait.
5589668 5591295 Something happened.
5592421 5594631 I looked for you at the coffee shop.
5596550 5598761 I began to wonder if I imagined you.
5600095 5602097 And then last night I had a dream.
5603223 5605350 In the dream,<br />you were surrounded by police,
5605517 5607060 then they started chasing us.
5608228 5611064 - Us?<br />- You were on my bike with me.
5613275 5614610 How did it end?
5616028 5617196 Notgood.
5619907 5623202 I've had dreams<br />that weren't just dreams.
5623368 5625496 You mean a dream that came true?
5628040 5629917 [Bell tinkling]
5630667 5633170 [Suspenseful music playing]
5633337 5635798 Finally, we can talk like adults.
5637633 5640594 I hate lying. I do.<br />It exhausts me.
5642554 5645891 Tiff and I have been waiting for you,<br />like, forever.
5645974 5648352 [Distorted rewinding]
5652940 5654191 D√©ja vu, right?
5656151 5658278 Oh, no use. You can't beat time.
5658445 5661949 This rewind is happening<br />faster than you can blink.
5666912 5668831 You gave me the idea.
5671834 5674962 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
5678048 5679091 "Bullet time."
5679299 5680968 [Grunts in slow motion]
5681051 5683095 I know. Kind of ironic,
5683262 5686807 using the power that defined you<br />to control you. [Chuckles]
5687099 5689685 I kept such a close eye on you
5689852 5691478 and, still, you found a way out.
5692479 5694731 Clever monkey, using that modal.
5695774 5698026 Call me an optimist,<br />but this could all be for the best.
5699361 5701780 The skin's not looking<br />too bad this time.
5702364 5704783 I know some of this<br />will be difficult for you to hear,
5704950 5706326 after everything you went through.
5706493 5707703 All that pain and suffering,
5707870 5710664 only to learn<br />the world doesn't end when you do.
5712207 5713292 Surprise.
5717170 5718547 [Neo grunts]
5719381 5720757 I was there when you died.
5720841 5722718 [Neo screaming]
5723260 5727723 I said to myself,<br />"here is the anomaly of anomalies."
5727890 5730517 What an extraordinary opportunity.
5732311 5735147 First, I had to convince the suits<br />to let me rebuild the two of you.
5735314 5738567 Why her? Getting there.<br />And don't worry, she can't hear me.
5738984 5741904 Resurrecting you both<br />was crazy expensive.
5742070 5743447 Like renovating a house.
5743614 5745657 Took twice as long, cost twice as much.
5748493 5749494 [Gasps]
5749578 5752205 I thought you'd be happy<br />to be alive again.
5753248 5754625 So wrong.
5754708 5756293 - [Machine whirring]<br />- [Screaming]
5756376 5759963 Did you know hope and despair<br />are nearly identical in code?
5760047 5761590 [Screaming]
5762007 5764009 We worked for years
5764176 5765719 trying to activate your source code.
5765886 5769097 I was about to give up,<br />when I realized...
5772184 5773226 Trinity.
5773393 5775604 It was neverjust you.
5775771 5778440 Alone, neither of you<br />is of any particular value.
5778774 5780359 [Trinity screaming]
5780442 5783570 Like acids and bases,<br />you're dangerous when mixed together.
5784196 5786365 Every sim where you two bonded,
5787240 5789201 let's just say bad things happened.
5797167 5800295 However, as long as I managed<br />to keep you close,
5800462 5802172 but not too close,
5802339 5804591 I discovered something incredible.
5805634 5809096 Now, my predecessor loved precision.
5809262 5812683 His matrix was all fussy facts<br />and equations.
5812849 5814601 He hated the human mind.
5814768 5817455 So he never bothered to realize<br />that you don't give a shit about facts.
5817479 5818897 It's all about fiction.
5819064 5823026 The only world that matters<br />is the one in here.
5823860 5826655 And you people believe<br />the craziest shit.
5828365 5831118 What validates<br />and makes your fictions real?
5832077 5833161 Feelings.
5834371 5835789 Allow me.
5837290 5838834 Kush here is one of my handlers.
5839001 5840252 They're everywhere.
5840419 5843088 Such a pain,<br />cloning agents over a coppertop.
5843255 5845465 Far more effective<br />just to saturate a population.
5847551 5850303 And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.
5850387 5851555 [Chuckles]
5858603 5860022 [Gun fires in slow motion]
5862733 5865819 Ooh! Nicely done.
5867446 5870115 You ever wonder why you have nightmares?
5870782 5873368 Why your own brain tortures you?
5873827 5876621 It's actually us,<br />maximizing your output.
5877330 5878457 It works just like this.
5878623 5881168 Oh, no. Can you stop the bullet?
5881334 5884337 If only you could move faster.
5884421 5886882 [Chuckles] Here's the thing<br />about feelings.
5887049 5889134 They're so much easier to control<br />than facts.
5890177 5892095 Turns out, in my matrix,
5892262 5895557 the worse we treat you,<br />the more we manipulate you,
5895724 5898060 the more energy you produce.
5898226 5899811 It's nuts. [Chomps]
5900604 5903482 I've been setting productivity records<br />every year since I took over.
5903648 5906318 And, the best part, zero resistance.
5906485 5907778 People stay in their pods,
5907944 5910322 happier than pigs in shit.
5911073 5912157 The key to it all?
5912324 5913575 You.
5913742 5914993 And her.
5915160 5917370 Quietly yearning<br />for what you don't have,
5917454 5919414 while dreading losing what you do.
5919873 5923919 For 99.9% of your race,<br />that is the definition of reality.
5924377 5926338 Desire and fear, baby.
5927464 5930217 Just give the people<br />what they want, right?
5931384 5932719 [Squelches]
5939684 5942395 She's the only home you have, Thomas.
5942854 5946024 Come home<br />before something terrible happens.
5946108 5948318 [Tense music playing]
5951321 5952823 [Neo grunts]
5954741 5955909 [Keyboard clacking]
5956451 5957452 - Bugs!<br />- I hear him.
5957911 5960747 - [Sirens approaching]<br />- [Tires screech]
5964042 5965043 Trinity!
5965127 5967003 - You shouldn't call me that.<br />- I'm sorry.
5968547 5969714 I have to go.
5969881 5971007 But I'll be back.
5972175 5974427 Neo! Time to go.
5975554 5976930 - [Gasps]<br />- [Alarm blaring]
5977013 5978473 - Sentinels?<br />- Worse.
5980267 5982411 [Sheperd on radio] General ordered me<br />to look after the ship.
5982435 5983436 So you shadowed us?
5984437 5985939 Check your long-range scans.
5986106 5987941 Squids are combing this area.
5988108 5989192 He's right.
5989693 5992737 You can stay here and die,<br />or come back and face a court-martial.
5993405 5995323 And you call that a choice?
6002789 6004833 [Niobe] Sheperd should have left you<br />to the squids.
6005000 6008128 I'm too damn old<br />to sit through some boring-ass trial.
6008295 6009421 Niobe, don't blame bugs.
6009588 6011131 Do shut your mouth.
6011590 6013925 Do address me as general.
6014092 6018221 And do not Rob my ex-captain<br />of her agency,
6018388 6020390 which she exercised with her own
6020473 6023810 particular brand<br />of shortsighted stupidity.
6025103 6026146 Shortsighted?
6028064 6031860 You care more about growing fruit<br />than freeing minds.
6032027 6034446 We are not going<br />to have this argument again.
6034613 6036448 It's not an argument. It's a fact.
6036948 6038074 You gave up on people.
6039701 6041912 I tell you what I'm going to give up on,
6041995 6043038 and it's you!
6045582 6048585 - Sheperd, get her out of my sight.<br />- General.
6050503 6051546 Disarm!
6051713 6053298 Kujaku's a friend.
6057969 6059304 [Kujaku warbling]
6059888 6061389 Hello, friend.
6061640 6062891 [Chittering softly]
6064059 6065060 Okay.
6066394 6067604 Him?
6074527 6075862 General.
6076363 6077614 Thank you for seeing me.
6077781 6081785 I figured if there was anyone<br />who could make sense of this mess,
6081952 6083662 it would be you.
6083828 6084871 Hello, Neo.
6085038 6086498 I know you.
6087040 6088917 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6091169 6092170 [Clicks tongue]
6093672 6095340 We met a long time ago.
6097092 6098134 Good morning.
6100971 6101972 Sati.
6102138 6104182 My father knew we'd meet again,
6104849 6106969 though he would have wished<br />for happier circumstances.
6107852 6109572 His inadvertent role<br />in what happened to you
6109688 6111773 was the greatest regret of his life.
6111940 6113733 I don't understand.
6115235 6118071 My father was the chief engineer<br />at the anomaleum.
6118238 6119698 [Niobe] The what?
6119864 6122492 My father designed the resurrection pods
6122993 6124744 where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.
6126830 6127831 [Niobe] I'm sorry.
6128248 6129749 You knew what happened to him?
6129916 6132919 You knew that he and Trinity<br />both were alive,
6134004 6135338 and you didn't tell me?
6135505 6138174 There were times<br />I doubted my decision, niobe.
6138341 6139968 But lo needed you.
6140135 6143471 This city needed to be built<br />for your people as well as mine.
6144806 6146266 If I would have told you everything,
6146683 6148683 you would have had<br />a very difficult choice to make.
6148768 6150312 My friends
6151730 6153898 let me make my own choices.
6154316 6156192 If it was a mistake,
6156359 6158320 you have my deepest apologies.
6160488 6161781 Why are you here now?
6161948 6164367 Neo's escape<br />has destabilized the matrix.
6164534 6167037 The anomaleum draws its current<br />from Trinity alone now.
6167329 6171291 A fail-safe has been triggered to reset<br />the matrix back to the previous version.
6171624 6173335 But the analyst halted the reset.
6173501 6176713 He's convinced the authorities<br />that you will soon return voluntarily.
6177964 6179341 And why would he say that?
6180091 6182927 Because if I don't go back,<br />he'll kill Trinity.
6185847 6188141 Faced with returning to your pod
6188308 6190352 or enduring Trinity's death again.
6191102 6192312 What would you choose, Neo?
6193438 6194689 I'll go back.
6196566 6198735 Well, the analyst knows you well,
6198902 6201404 but that knowledge<br />has made him incautious.
6201571 6202614 After you escaped,
6202697 6205658 he should have accepted his losses<br />and devacuated Trinity.
6206493 6209079 But that would have prevented<br />this extraordinary opportunity
6209245 6211081 that now exists before us.
6211790 6213625 A few hours ago,
6214959 6218213 no one would have been able<br />to convince me
6218380 6222425 that I would be standing here,<br />trying to explain a mission
6222592 6224469 as crazy as this one.
6228348 6229891 What are you doing?
6230058 6231643 - Volunteering.<br />- Oh, no.
6231810 6236064 You are the one captain<br />that I am ordering to go.
6236398 6239567 Now you don't have to order me,<br />general, 'cause I'm volunteering.
6242987 6244489 I need two more.
6249077 6251371 Are you out of your minds?
6252038 6253790 You don't even know what it is.
6253957 6256292 General, we know you.
6256960 6260213 If you say this is important,<br />none of us is choosing to stay home.
6265635 6266678 Thank you.
6271850 6273768 Knuckle up and good luck.
6285447 6287449 [Dramatic music playing]
6288074 6289325 [Kujaku chittering]
6303965 6307302 [Sati] Trinity is held in the anomaleum,<br />which is in this transmission tower.
6307469 6309637 The passages used to rescue Neo<br />are now sealed
6309804 6311806 and a legion of sentinels<br />patrols the tower.
6311973 6313933 So stealth will be Paramount.
6314100 6315852 As long as we raise no alarms,
6316019 6318080 this first part of the mission<br />should be the easiest.
6318104 6321107 You mean crossing the fetus fields,<br />sneaking across an entire power plant,
6321274 6324527 climbing a two-kilometer tower<br />guarded by thousands of sentinels?
6324652 6325695 That's the easy part?
6325862 6327113 Exactly so.
6327780 6329991 Because all we have to do<br />is convince someone
6330074 6331659 who does this every day
6331826 6333119 to take one of us along.
6333203 6335323 - [Electricity crackling]<br />- [Dramatic music continues]
6356809 6360230 Fifty meters below the anomaleum<br />is a stratum of amniotic filters.
6360396 6363399 Hidden along this edge<br />is a small hexagonal vent.
6363900 6366986 This vent feeds the air intake<br />into the corpuscular modifier,
6367153 6370031 which oxygenates<br />the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.
6370698 6371699 I get it.
6371866 6374869 The exomorph<br />slinkies up Neo's old umbilicus.
6376204 6377330 What could go wrong?
6377413 6379707 [Tense music playing]
6390343 6391427 [Grunts]
6406985 6408194 [Straining]
6424210 6426754 [Sati] Once inside,<br />morpheus will use the system operator
6426921 6429674 to open the devacuatorline<br />and disengage the macerators.
6429966 6431342 [Machinery clanking]
6434095 6435638 In order to unplug Trinity's body,
6435805 6437890 while her mind<br />still remains connected to the matrix,
6438057 6440768 I'm gonna need a second human brain<br />to implement the bypass.
6440935 6442645 And since Neo must be with the analyst,
6442812 6446899 the only available mind<br />that's a near-enough match is yours.
6448443 6449444 Figures.
6449527 6451029 [Tense music playing]
6466919 6468004 Thanks, cybebe.
6469047 6470048 [Grunts]
6476429 6478306 Does Trinity still have to<br />take the red pill?
6478473 6481153 Since kujaku and I are transferring<br />her consciousness onto the ship,
6481309 6482935 it's not strictly necessary.
6483102 6485813 But what matters<br />is that this is her choice.
6487148 6489400 Extracting a confused<br />or an uncertain mind
6489484 6491736 will, in all probability, kill her.
6491903 6494489 But even if it is what she wants,
6494656 6497992 won't the analyst<br />just order the sentinels to stop you?
6498159 6499243 He will.
6499911 6501829 But if my plan works, it won't matter.
6503456 6504957 Because we'll already be gone.
6506876 6510088 Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,<br />there has to be a reason why.
6512382 6515551 When my father realized<br />how the anomaleum was going to be used,
6516135 6518888 he covertly transferred<br />the designs to me.
6519639 6521974 The analyst discovered his betrayal,
6522141 6523935 and had my parents purged.
6525144 6526604 [Inhales sharply]
6526688 6529565 I would have been murdered too<br />if it wasn't for kujaku.
6532777 6535363 Not a day goes by<br />that I don't grieve them.
6536948 6539659 I've been praying for this day<br />for a very long time.
6543413 6544539 [Door unlocks, opens]
6548042 6549460 We're coming up on broadcast.
6552255 6556050 I thought you should know<br />that I'm here because of her.
6559804 6561931 All I ever wanted<br />was to be as fearless as Trinity.
6564350 6567395 But I saw how she reacted in the garage,<br />and I...
6567770 6569981 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6570440 6571899 What if we're too late?
6573818 6575403 What if she's not Trinity anymore?
6577280 6578489 [Sighs]
6580950 6583578 I never believed I was the one.
6584495 6585872 But she did.
6586956 6588541 She believed in me.
6591335 6593421 It's my turn to believe in her.
6594547 6595548 [Sighs]
6597884 6599802 [Suspenseful music playing]
6618571 6620323 [Sati] This is where it gets tricky.
6631667 6633878 Have you ever done<br />an operation like this?
6634587 6635671 Not yet.
6639383 6641260 [Suspenseful music builds]
6657443 6658778 Here we go.
6658903 6660738 [Suspenseful music continues]
6676420 6678047 Welcome home.
6678506 6680716 All I want is to talk to her.
6680883 6682218 Do you mean tiff?
6682385 6685304 Come back, and you can talk to her<br />as often as you like.
6685471 6688432 I mean, handsome Chad<br />may have something to say about it.
6688599 6691686 If she tells me this is what she wants,
6692895 6693980 you win.
6694146 6695231 Really?
6695398 6697358 But if she wants me,
6698276 6700152 then you'll let us go free.
6700319 6703072 And why would I do something<br />as stupid as that?
6703239 6705825 Right now, I'm on a ship full of people<br />who will unplug me
6705992 6708286 before they'll let you take me back.
6708995 6710580 If you want this matrix,
6711122 6712707 this is your only chance.
6712874 6715418 But how do I know<br />they won't unplug you anyway?
6715918 6719046 Same way I know<br />you'll let us walk out of here.
6720423 6722633 [Suspenseful music playing]
6744655 6745823 Okay.
6746449 6747909 I like tests.
6748868 6750411 We'll let tiff decide.
6750745 6752413 [Electricity crackling]
6764425 6765760 [Sati breathing heavily]
6767970 6769096 That's it.
6770348 6771515 Bypass is ready.
6771933 6773267 Now what?
6773726 6774769 We wait.
6775144 6777063 Doesn't it seem crazy<br />to come all this way
6777146 6778522 and leave her here?
6778898 6780900 We must abide by her decision.
6781609 6783110 And if she says no,
6783986 6785363 what happens to Neo?
6785529 6789617 At this time,<br />the most important choice of Neo's life
6789784 6791202 is not his to make.
6798334 6800461 [Slow suspenseful music playing]
6822316 6824026 I saw this in my dream.
6825653 6828948 If I was the oracle,<br />maybe I could explain it.
6829615 6831158 The oracle.
6831325 6832952 From your game?
6834870 6837081 It's not a game.
6839208 6840418 Oh, god.
6845256 6846590 [Tiffany sighs]
6848009 6851262 After you left, I went home
6851429 6853097 and I played it.
6855516 6856892 I kept thinking,
6858227 6861355 "why does this story<br />feel like a memory?"
6868612 6870281 There's a part of me
6873159 6876078 that feels like I have been<br />waiting my whole life for you.
6879123 6881417 And that part is like,
6881584 6884253 "what the hell<br />took you so long?" [Sniffles]
6885254 6887214 I don't have an easy answer.
6889467 6891552 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6893095 6894889 Afraid of what might happen.
6896599 6899393 Afraid of hurting<br />the only person I ever loved.
6901270 6904648 I wish I was who you think I am.
6906067 6907610 But look at me.
6908986 6910529 I can't be her.
6911322 6913282 - [Donnie] Mom!<br />- [Brandon] Mom! Come on.
6913449 6914575 - Mom!<br />- It's Callie.
6914742 6915743 Is this real?
6915910 6916970 [Donnie] You have to come with us.
6916994 6918138 [Brandon] Come on, we gotta go.
6918162 6919246 Tiff, hey.
6919330 6921349 Don't know what's going on here,<br />but I'm glad we found you.
6921373 6922934 - She got hit by a car.<br />- I know, it's crazy.
6922958 6924085 She was chasing after you.
6924251 6925437 They're casting her arm. We gotta go.
6925461 6926730 [Chad] Doctor said she's gonna be fine.
6926754 6928714 [Donnie] You have to come with us<br />to the hospital.
6928881 6929882 It's too late.
6930049 6931092 I understand.
6931258 6933135 - Tiff, come on, let's go.<br />- [Donnie] Come on.
6939683 6940726 What's happening?
6942853 6944021 Neo was wrong.
6944105 6946315 [Somber music playing]
6977304 6978389 Tiffany.
6982101 6984520 Tiffany, you have to come with us.
6986230 6987523 Tiffany! [Echoing]
6989984 6993487 I wish you would<br />fucking stop calling me that.
6993654 6995156 I hate that name.
6996699 6998284 My name is Trinity
6998450 7000661 and you better<br />take your hands off of me.
7001787 7003455 [Trinity grunting]
7013340 7014341 Trinity!
7015551 7016552 Oh, shit.
7017928 7019138 Get her out. Get her out!
7019305 7021265 [Grunts, yells]
7027897 7030357 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7031400 7033944 I own that mistake.<br />Shouldn't have pressed.
7034111 7036071 Women used to be so easy to control.
7037281 7041577 You know there's no way<br />I can let you two go free.
7045039 7046457 Cannot happen.
7049793 7052463 So, I guess it's deja vu all over again.
7053589 7054757 She dies,
7055549 7056842 and it's all your fault.
7058427 7060971 Lies, lies and more lies.
7061722 7062932 Smith?
7063098 7065577 What has the world come to<br />when you can't even trust a program?
7065601 7067978 - How...<br />- [Gun clatters]
7069104 7071398 Tom and I have more in common<br />than you know.
7071857 7074777 Once he got out, let's just say,
7075694 7077404 I was free to be me.
7078155 7079531 [Grunts]
7085162 7087331 - Yeah!<br />- Trinity?
7087998 7090042 [Tense music playing]
7104306 7105599 [Bell tinkling]
7113482 7115359 [All grunting]
7119405 7120739 [Trinity groaning]
7123450 7124994 [Breathes shakily]
7136255 7137298 You ready?
7137464 7138757 Yeah.
7142094 7143512 [Bugs groans, yells]
7150185 7151270 [Bell tinkling]

7160779 7162281 [Distorted screaming]
7165200 7167745 [Yells]
7170539 7172708 - [Sati grunts]<br />- [Screaming]
7175169 7176211 [Screaming]
7180883 7182301 Oh, no.
7183761 7186055 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7206283 7209578 [Neo and Trinity straining]
7209912 7211205 Stop them.
7211497 7214541 [Both yelling]
7223384 7225135 [Explosion]
7237106 7238524 You think this is over?
7238690 7240609 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7249743 7251912 Here, our unexpected alliance ends.
7253747 7255582 You know the difference between us, Tom?
7256417 7257835 Anyone could have been you.
7258377 7260295 Whereas I've always been anyone.
7262714 7264466 [Grunting]
7265759 7266844 What just happened?
7267302 7268429 What?
7270556 7272850 - [Alarm blaring]<br />- Oh, no! Move! Move!
7273183 7274226 Get the hell out of there.
7274309 7276353 [Tense music playing]
7278147 7279982 - How bad?<br />- Like, all the bad.
7281358 7282734 Yeah, this is bad.
7284278 7285737 I don't suppose you can still fly?
7292828 7294788 [Grunting]
7296248 7297833 Yeah, that's not happening.
7300127 7301670 [Ominous music playing]
7321857 7323484 [All screaming]
7323609 7324860 Neo! Get on.
7324943 7326487 [Engine revving]
7333619 7335370 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7335537 7337414 Everyone else, we stay with them!
7354640 7357017 - How is she?<br />- Life signs are good.
7360979 7362314 Her signal's strong, captain.
7364900 7365901 [Kujaku squawks]
7371240 7373242 Well done, captain.
7375702 7377412 Now all we need is a miracle.
7377829 7379831 [Tense music playing]
7383669 7384711 [Siren wailing]
7391718 7392844 [Neo grunts]
7396265 7397516 [Tires screech]
7405607 7406608 I hate bots.
7413073 7414866 - Get us out of here!<br />- I'm trying!
7415033 7416833 The lockdown is tracking.<br />Swarm is everywhere.
7416994 7418194 Never seen anything like this.
7428046 7429172 [Grunts]
7431800 7433176 [Siren wailing]
7435012 7436722 [Tense music playing]
7438307 7439766 [Engine revving]
7463999 7466126 Seq, what is that?
7471173 7472257 What's wrong?
7474051 7475469 What are you... [screams]
7479806 7480807 [Grunts]
7483143 7485062 He's turning bots into bombs.
7487314 7488815 [Glass shattering]
7491151 7492944 [Bodies thudding]
7500118 7501662 [Tires screeching]
7511713 7513090 [Tires screeching]
7517552 7518637 Shit! [Grunts]
7518804 7519805 Lexy?
7519888 7521640 [Gunfire]
7528480 7530120 - [Tires screeching]<br />- [Tram bell ringing]
7534277 7535445 Sheperd's in trouble.
7535529 7536863 [Lexy grunting]
7538532 7539700 Jack me in.
7540617 7542657 I can get you in.<br />I don't know if I can get you out.
7548500 7550085 - No!<br />- [Tires screeching]
7557092 7558719 [Motorcycle revving]
7563515 7564558 What are they doing?
7568729 7570272 Herding them into a kill zone.
7596339 7597549 [Both groaning]
7601386 7602512 [Neo groaning]
7603430 7604806 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7604890 7607058 - [Lexy groaning]<br />- Hang on, Lex.
7607142 7608435 [Lexy screaming]
7611313 7613064 - [Lexy! {Grunfing]
7620947 7623033 [Tense music playing]
7655398 7656598 [SWAT officer] There they are!
7669871 7671206 [Neo straining]
7679339 7680799 [All grunting]
7682926 7684094 Morpheus!
7687973 7688974 Lex.
7689850 7691643 - Bugsy.<br />- Hell yeah!
7692644 7694229 Seq, where's Neo?
7694396 7695939 It's bad. They're pinned.
7696106 7697107 Heading to a roof.
7709494 7710912 [Dramatic music playing]
7717627 7718920 [Neo grunting]
7744529 7746907 [Neo yelling, grunts loudly]
7758585 7759878 [Both grunting]
7762130 7763924 [Machine beeping rapidly]
7766509 7769137 Nodal fibrillation is critical.<br />She'll die if we don't extract.
7789491 7792577 [Soft dramatic music playing]
7796039 7797832 [Inhales deeply]
7800168 7801711 [Exhales]
7810178 7812764 It's so beautiful.
7828113 7829781 I remember this.
7831908 7834077 I remember us.
7852220 7854180 My dream ended here.
7865108 7866651 We can't go back.
7868778 7869863 We won't.
7885128 7886755 [Evocative music playing]
7889215 7890508 Can they make the jump?
7895430 7896639 [Music stops]
7904397 7906191 [Slow evocative music playing]
7914240 7916993 [Grunting]
7921664 7922832 I'm not doing this.
7923374 7924667 Are you doing this?
7926920 7928379 [Dramatic music playing]
7939516 7941476 [Helicopter hovering]
7948775 7949859 Bye.
7984811 7986354 [Soft music playing]
8013173 8014757 - [Bell tinkling]<br />- [Meows]
8015800 8017051 [Crumbling in distance]
8020471 8022098 [Suspenseful music playing]
8030940 8032483 How dramatic.
8033318 8034402 "Tiffany"?
8034819 8037655 [Chuckles] It was a private joke.
8037822 8039282 An amusement, that's all.
8039449 8041534 An amusement? Hmm.
8041826 8042869 [Flesh tears]
8043578 8045580 - [Softly] Whoa.<br />- [Groaning]
8045747 8047123 Kind of like that?
8047207 8048249 [Chokes]
8049959 8051294 [Gulps]
8051377 8053796 Okay. Ow.
8054339 8056424 If you hated the name so much,<br />why did you heel
8056549 8058051 like a good little bitch so long?
8058134 8059486 - [Trinity grunts]<br />- [Blade slices]
8059510 8060595 [Body thuds]
8061221 8063306 Yeah. Definitely asked for that.
8065266 8067477 - [Snaps fingers]<br />- [The analyst groaning]
8068770 8070563 [Shudders] Can't you control her?
8073566 8074943 [Groaning]
8076486 8078112 That was for using children.
8083076 8084577 We have a few questions.
8084744 8087914 - You tried to activate the fail-safe.<br />- The suits tried.
8088081 8090250 Obviously, without control<br />of your source code,
8090416 8091751 I knew that was impossible.
8091918 8093962 So, why haven't the suits purged you?
8094921 8096798 Because I know the system.
8097632 8099384 I know human beings.
8100134 8101636 And I know you.
8102428 8103972 [Bones crack, sighs]
8104931 8107308 Right now, you're feeling good<br />about what you've done.
8107475 8109727 You should. It was a victory. Bravo.
8110561 8111896 Now what?
8112063 8114691 You've come here<br />to negotiate some kind of deal?
8114857 8116276 You think you hold all the cards
8116442 8118736 because you can do<br />whatever you want in this world.
8118903 8121239 I say, go for it.
8121406 8123908 Remake it. Knock yourselves out.
8124075 8125994 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8126160 8127287 But here's the thing.
8127453 8130331 The sheeple aren't going anywhere.
8130498 8131749 They like my world.
8131916 8134752 They don't want this sentimentality.
8134919 8136671 They don't want freedom or empowerment.
8136838 8139215 They want to be controlled.
8139382 8141342 They crave the comfort of certainty.
8141509 8144178 And that means you two,<br />back in your pods,
8144345 8147682 unconscious and alone, just like them.
8149642 8151269 [Both chuckle]
8152103 8154731 We're not here to negotiate anything.
8154897 8156983 We were on our way to remake your world.
8157150 8158568 Change a few things.
8158735 8161112 I kind of like the<br />"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.
8161195 8163364 Just remind people<br />what a free mind can do.
8163531 8164991 I forgot. It's easy to forget.
8165158 8167493 - He makes it easy.<br />- That, he does.
8167660 8169704 Something he should think about.
8170788 8174334 Before we got started,<br />we decided to stop by to say thank you.
8175168 8177962 You gave us something<br />we never thought we could have.
8178129 8179464 And what is that?
8180381 8181966 Another chance.
8182300 8184135 [Punk rock music playing]
8845546 8848132 Face reality, people. Movies are dead.
8848298 8850134 Games are dead.
8850300 8852094 Narrative? Dead.
8852261 8854138 Media is nothing<br />but neuro-trigger response
8854221 8855222 and viral conditioning.
8855389 8856932 Wait, what are you two talking about?
8859226 8860394 Cat videos.
8861270 8864857 What we need is a series of videos
8865024 8867276 that we call "the catrix."
