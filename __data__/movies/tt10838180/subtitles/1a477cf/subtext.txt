58225 59841 - [woman] <i>Seq, I'm in.</i><br />- [Seq] <i>Captain.</i>
60018 62180 [woman] <i>You were right.<br />The skylight was a window pane.</i>
62271 63623 [Seq] <i>I've got serious interference.</i>
63647 65684 [woman] <i>Weird. It's some kind of Modal.</i>
65857 67643 [Seq] <i>Looks like old code.</i>
67818 69138 [woman] <i>It feels really familiar.</i>
69278 70838 [Seq] <i>Drop a pin.<br />I'll signal for backup.</i>
70862 72257 - [woman] <i>I'm gonna check it out.</i><br />- [Seq] <i>Bugs?</i>
72281 73883 <i>If the general finds out<br />we've been fishing...</i>
73907 75693 [Bugs] <i>A quick peek can't hurt.</i>
75867 77178 - [static]<br />- [Seq] <i>Did you hear that?</i>
77202 78642 <i>Shit. I think our signal was traced.</i>
78704 80615 <i>Bugs, this feels like a trap.</i>
80789 81950 <i>Bugs!</i>
82124 83285 [suspenseful music playing]
122039 124326 [SWAT officer] Freeze! Do not move!
124499 125499 We will shoot!
125626 128914 Very slowly, raise your hands.
129004 130415 [suspenseful music playing]
142726 144262 [lieutenant] Here we go.
150192 151353 Hey, where are you going?
151777 152983 You were warned, Lieutenant.
153153 155235 I think we can handle one little girl.
158742 162076 You're wasting your time!<br />My men are bringing her down now.
162245 163280 No, Lieutenant.
164498 166364 Your men are already dead.
174549 175549 [gasps slowly]
176968 178208 Seq, you with me?
178387 179547 This old code keeps crashing.
179596 181240 Your projection's breaking up.<br />Switch to audio.
181264 183864 [Seq] Bugs, this is a direct violation<br />of the general's protocols.
183934 187017 I know, I know.<br />But something is happening here.
187938 189599 Something important.
189773 190854 [Bugs] Oh, fuck.
191024 192435 We know what happens next.
192609 194225 She kicks their ass.
198031 199567 [all grunting]
212921 213956 [groans]
216842 218173 Now she makes a call.
218343 219463 [woman] The line was traced.
219761 221877 - And then...<br />- Then she runs for her life.
222055 223261 [woman] Are there any Agents?
223432 224763 We know this story.
226393 227929 This is how it all began.
228687 230052 God damn it.
230647 231728 This is where he began.
232274 235141 You're thinking this Modal is a loop?<br />Or a treadmill?
235652 238940 Some sort of sequencer<br />evolving a program to do what?
239114 240229 I don't know.
241491 242947 But I'm going to find out.
243118 244233 All right.

269936 270936 [woman grunts]
272355 273641 [woman groaning]
275066 277307 So déja vu<br />and yet it's obviously all wrong.
277486 279443 Why use old code<br />to mirror something new?
279613 280978 I don't know.
281323 282563 [all grunting]
293084 294084 [panting]
294753 297541 If that's supposed to be Trinity,<br />that's not what happens.
299674 301540 Maybe this isn't the story<br />we think it is.
301718 304050 Bugs, you have to get out of here.
304221 306258 - It's gotta be a trap.<br />- [helicopter whirring]
307724 308724 Shit.
311144 312600 [ominous music playing]

346471 347506 [Bugs] Uh...
347889 349254 You all carry on.
349724 350724 As you were.
353770 355260 I'm just gonna...
356231 357562 see myself out.
358024 359024 Kill her.
360652 361652 [grunts]

450492 451778 [dramatic music builds]
462796 464156 - Why did you save me?<br />- You first.
464297 465787 Who are you? Where did you come from?
465966 467001 Okay.
467634 468840 My name is Bugs.
469469 471710 As in "Bunny."
471888 473504 And tech that listens.
474683 476549 Do you know this is a Modal?
477852 478933 What's a Modal?
479104 481311 It's a simulation<br />used to evolve programs.
485235 487067 Do you understand that you are...
488029 489611 digital sentience?
489781 491397 I know what I am.
491574 494862 Just like I know my job is to hunt down<br />and destroy sentience...
495036 496242 like you.
500458 501948 And yet...
503753 504753 Here we are.
505171 506536 Here we are.
508216 510298 The other Agents<br />don't know about this room?
512303 513509 How'd you find it?
513680 515591 No one was ever in the key shop,
516182 517297 so I started looking.
518601 520558 More you looked, the more you found.
521646 523182 Story of my life.
530321 531321 What?
533575 535065 I feel like I know this room.
543752 546119 Holy shit.
548590 550001 This is his apartment.
550091 551252 [gasps]
551342 553128 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
553553 555419 I searched everywhere. He doesn't exist.
555597 557759 He stopped being Thomas a long time ago,
557932 560139 but maybe you know him by his real name.
560894 561975 Neo.
563480 564686 You do.
565774 567356 Oh, okay.
568026 569437 Uh...
569527 572144 I can't believe this,<br />after all these years.
572322 575781 You see, most people<br />think that Neo is dead.
577202 578533 But I know he's not.
579579 581240 Because I've seen him.
583500 584500 Where?
585585 587917 It's not something<br />I can explain easily, but...
592592 595175 <i>But the moment he looked at me,</i>
595720 597256 I felt something...
600683 602299 unlock my mind.
604854 605935 Okay.
608399 610185 Something like that happened to me.
615198 616780 <i>I saw this pattern...</i>
618159 619490 <i>and it was everywhere.</i>
621329 623616 We can't see it,<br />but we're all trapped inside
623706 625288 these strange, repeating loops.
626334 629076 Somehow, I saw it in the mirror.
629712 632295 Just a flicker,<br />but it was like you said.
637887 639753 And suddenly I understood.
640348 642715 This is not the real world.
645436 648519 [agent] <i>For the first time,<br />I felt real purpose.</i>
649232 650722 I knew who I was
651317 653149 and what I had to do.
653820 655231 Who are you?
656656 658272 What do you have to do?
661244 662530 I am...
663371 664702 Morpheus.
665915 668122 And I have to find Neo.
669335 672168 [Bugs gasping]
672297 673628 Morpheus.
676634 678170 Okay. Okay.
678344 679379 Oh, my God!
679554 680754 I have to get you out of here.
680889 683005 I need to figure out<br />who built this Modal.
683433 685015 Okay, come with me.
685185 687288 You have to be ready to leave.<br />You have to be really ready.
687312 688312 And if you're not,
688396 690156 if you think that<br />this is where you belong...
693193 694399 You call this a choice?
694569 696338 Oh, honestly, when somebody<br />offered me these things,
696362 697923 I went off on<br />binary conceptions of the world
697947 699587 and said there was no way<br />I was swallowing
699616 701402 some symbolic reduction of my life.
701576 704096 And the woman with the pills laughed<br />'cause I was missing the point.
704120 705656 What point?
705830 707821 The choice is an illusion.
708833 710915 You already know what you have to do.
717675 718756 Truth.
725475 726475 Okay.
726643 729385 There's an old building<br />with a skylight and lots of stairs.
729562 730723 The Lafayette.
730897 732457 One of the four back doors leads there.
733233 734439 [Morpheus] Oh.
734525 736003 - Don't fight it.<br />- Whoa, what's happening?
736027 737027 Keep breathing.
737195 740529 Extraction works pretty much the same<br />for humans and programs.
743368 744368 Ouch.
744452 745487 Ah.
746913 748199 Okay.
750833 752244 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
752418 754079 I've never worn<br />different glasses before.
754254 756245 Yeah, looks good. Which door?
757090 758751 - It's gotta be...<br />- Okay.
763846 765177 Agent White.
765640 766801 Agent Smith?
766891 768131 [laughs]
769310 770425 [Bugs grunts]
772605 773970 - [Bugs] Go!<br />- [grunts]
778569 779809 [men grunting]
781281 782863 Seq! Can you hear me?
783032 784272 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
784450 785678 Can you get us to the window pane?
785702 787568 Bugs! Bugs! He's an Agent!
790498 792159 [Morpheus exclaims, grunts]
797839 800001 That window! Go hard!
809058 810674 [both screaming]
816399 818140 [screaming fades]
827577 829693 [keyboard clacking]
841424 843165 [fast-paced music playing on speakers]
846387 848674 - [computer buzzing]<br />- What the...
855021 856728 What the hell?
857148 859264 [suspenseful music playing]
873831 874831 Something wrong?
875333 877574 Uh... Just a little crash.
878169 880160 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
880671 883754 What a beautiful day to be alive.<br />Am I right?
884509 886375 - Problemo?<br />- He lost something.
887845 889006 Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?
891099 892681 A little Modal experiment.
892850 894636 - For <i>Binary?</i><br />- [cell phone chimes]
895853 898390 - I need a coffee.<br />- Coffee. Yes, stat!
898481 899562 I'm buying.
902777 904617 [man] I'm not trying to<br />blow smoke up your ass,
904654 908238 but the first time I played the trilogy,<br />I was shook.
909117 911484 The paradox<br />between free will and destiny.
911661 914028 Are we all just algorithms<br />doing what we're supposed to do,
914247 915954 or can we escape our programming?
916124 919082 Genius, inside the context of the game,<br />BT dubs.
920086 922123 Hey, did I tell you<br />it took over my life?
922296 924583 Yeah. I failed the seventh grade.<br />[chuckles]
925049 926380 Your game almost ruined me.
927301 929838 - So you've said.<br />- Yet here we are.
929929 932591 - [cups clink]<br />- You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
932723 933723 is it free will
935017 936599 or destiny?
941274 942935 Oh, yeah.
943317 944728 There she is.
945319 946775 Total f-ing MILF.
947738 949695 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
949991 952107 I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.
952285 953491 Maybe you should go.
953661 956528 No, please. I... I promise, best self.
956706 957912 Best self.
961836 963076 Sure.
964046 965377 You ever talk to her?
967550 968550 Tell you what.
968676 972920 For all you've done for me,<br />let me do this for you.
973514 975380 Jude, no. Stop.
976434 977924 - Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Thanks.
978102 979592 Hi. Um...
979770 982512 I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.<br />I'm Jude Gallagher.
983191 985558 I work for a game company<br />called Deus Machina.
985735 987021 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
987195 989983 Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.
990156 992067 - Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.<br />- Jude.
992241 995984 Oh, and this is my very good friend,<br />Thomas Anderson.
996162 997903 He is a bona fide famous person
998080 999570 and considered by most to be
999665 1001451 the greatest game designer<br />of our generation.
1001626 1002787 I'm sorry about this.
1002960 1004229 - Jude...<br />- [softly] Just talk to her.
1004253 1006620 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.
1007507 1008713 Hi.
1015932 1017013 Have we met?
1018559 1020675 Uh, we both come here.
1020853 1022372 - Can I have your morning bun?<br />- [boy] Hey.
1022396 1023790 Are you trying to ball my mom or what?
1023814 1025100 - Brandon!<br />- [chuckles]
1025191 1027023 [Boy 2] Can I have one bite?
1027193 1030026 Babe. What's going on?<br />We're gonna be late.
1030196 1032062 This is my husband, Chad.
1032240 1033901 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hey.
1035701 1037567 Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.
1037745 1039531 Right. Sorry. [chuckles]
1039956 1041492 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1045419 1047001 [soft music playing]
1065856 1066937 What?
1067024 1068856 [keyboard clacking]
1070194 1071275 [ominous music playing]
1074407 1076648 Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.
1082832 1085665 "Billions of people<br />just living out their lives,
1086919 1088705 oblivious."
1090756 1092497 I always loved that line.
1093217 1094582 You wrote that one, yeah?
1097388 1099129 Every time I stand here,
1099599 1102557 I mean, O-M-G.
1103019 1104930 It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.
1106105 1107391 - Right?<br />- [chuckles softly]
1109275 1110515 Yeah.
1111319 1112434 Sure.
1112653 1114439 Have a seat.
1116198 1117404 [man sighs]
1117491 1118652 Smoke?
1119994 1120994 I thought you quit.
1121954 1123410 I quit calling it a habit.
1124498 1126239 Now it's just a guilty pleasure.
1128586 1131328 Oh. Maybe I can make this easy for you.
1132214 1134296 I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.
1134467 1136547 This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.<br />It's bigger than that.
1136677 1138133 This is about our future,
1138220 1140427 which is a sticky subject,<br />given our past.
1141098 1142259 What do you mean?
1143434 1144720 How's the therapy?
1145061 1146347 Good.
1147063 1148519 Any...
1149523 1150809 episodes?
1152610 1153691 No.
1154362 1156103 That's terrific.
1158074 1160691 Look, Tom,<br />I know we've always had our differences.
1161577 1163318 What did you say<br />about our first meeting?
1163496 1166329 We had all the chemistry<br />of an FBI interrogation.
1166707 1167707 [muffled yell]
1168209 1169290 [scoffs]
1169377 1170708 But look at this place.
1171837 1173123 We did this.
1174507 1175713 Together.
1177093 1178458 Yeah.
1178636 1179842 Now what?
1180846 1183338 Things have changed. The market's tough.
1184558 1185764 I'm sure you can understand
1185851 1188183 why our beloved parent company,<br />Warner Bros.,
1188354 1190595 has decided to make a sequel<br />to the trilogy.
1190690 1191725 What?
1191899 1194099 They informed me<br />they're gonna do it with or without us.
1194360 1195850 I thought they couldn't do that.
1196112 1197193 [exhales]
1197279 1198610 Oh, they can.
1198781 1199781 And they made it clear
1199865 1201856 they'll kill our contract<br />if we don't cooperate.
1202368 1203403 Really?
1204328 1207195 I know you said<br />the story was over for you,
1208290 1210281 but that's the thing about stories.
1212211 1213793 They never really end, do they?
1214338 1216750 We're still telling the same stories<br />we've always told,
1216924 1221009 just with different names,<br />different faces
1222805 1225718 and I have to say I'm kind of excited.
1228644 1229884 After all these years,
1229979 1232141 to be going back<br />to where it all started.
1232982 1235223 Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>
1236444 1238230 I've spoken to Marketing...
1238320 1242314 - [sinister music playing]<br />- [distorted voice]
1244118 1245199 [in normal voice] Tom?
1245661 1246696 Yeah.
1247371 1248371 Are you all right?
1248456 1249821 [exhales nervously]
1250666 1251781 Yeah.
1256922 1258913 [analyst] What were you feeling<br />at that point?
1262094 1263801 What was I feeling?
1267266 1271681 I felt either I'm having<br />a mental breakdown again
1272188 1276182 or I'm living inside<br />a computer-generated reality
1276358 1277814 that has imprisoned me...
1278486 1279601 again.
1280362 1281568 [laughs]
1283574 1284689 [chuckles softly]
1290372 1291703 Not much of a choice.
1291874 1292874 No.
1293334 1294824 Maybe it's not as binary as that.
1295002 1298120 Maybe there are other ways<br />to understand what happened.
1298714 1299749 Yeah.
1299924 1302131 Thomas, you are a suicide survivor
1302301 1305009 gifted with a powerful imagination.
1305179 1307011 Those facts have combined
1307097 1309509 to create dangerous fictions<br />in your life.
1309683 1312266 Yesterday, you walked into a meeting<br />with your business partner
1312436 1313597 and he ambushed you,
1313771 1316433 demanding you make a game<br />you said you would never make.
1316607 1319349 This attack<br />effectively took away your voice.
1320027 1322644 His violence triggered you<br />and your mind fought back.
1322822 1324529 You did to him<br />what he was doing to you.
1326158 1330322 We've talked about the value<br />of adaptive anger in healing trauma.
1331372 1334490 Far from suggesting<br />a repeat of your initial breakdown,
1334667 1337659 I believe this episode<br />demonstrates healthy self-protection.
1339421 1340582 And more importantly,
1340673 1343836 I remember how hard it was<br />for you to share something like this.
1344802 1347339 Which tells me just how far we've come.
1348806 1350217 [chuckles softly]
1352643 1354680 Do you need a refill<br />on your prescription?
1354812 1356519 [sighs]
1356605 1357766 Yeah.
1362778 1364018 [pills rattle]
1368701 1370988 [mysterious music playing]
1377960 1379121 [grunts softly]
1380546 1382662 First of all,<br />I know I speak for everyone
1382840 1385081 when I say that I'm so, so excited
1385259 1388752 to be working on a game<br />that was such a, well, game changer.
1389513 1393723 Now, the packet in front of you<br />has our focus group research.
1393851 1395307 Inside, you'll find the breakdown,
1395477 1398390 including key word association<br />with the brand.
1398564 1401602 The top two<br />being "originality" and "fresh,"
1401775 1403641 which I think are great things<br />to keep in mind
1403861 1405898 as you begin working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>
1407573 1409029 And who knows how many more?
1410784 1411945 [alarm buzzing, stops]
1417708 1418914 [singing indistinctly]
1424798 1427836 What made <i>Matrix</i> different?<br />It effed with your head.
1428052 1429213 On point.
1429595 1431506 People want us up in their grey space,
1431680 1434172 switching their synaptic WTF light on.
1434725 1436932 ["White Rabbit" playing]
1440397 1441808 [man laughing]
1443943 1447106 What made <i>Matrix</i> different?<br />It effed with your head.
1447279 1448940 People want us up in their grey space,
1449114 1450320 switching their synaptic
1450449 1453066 "What the hell is going on here?"<br />light on.
1460000 1461490 [panting]
1461585 1463121 [shower running]
1463379 1467498 I didn't love the first one,<br />like some of you.
1467675 1470042 And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance
1470219 1472460 for anything that requires<br />a syllabus and a highlighter.
1472638 1474345 I like my games big, loud and dumb.
1474515 1476381 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1476558 1479050 <i>Matrix</i> means mayhem.
1479144 1481761 [grunting]
1483857 1485939 Mindless action is not on-brand.
1486026 1487026 [man] She's right.
1487194 1490528 <i>Matrix</i> is mind porn.<br />Philosophy in shiny,
1490698 1492234 - tight PVC.<br />- Yeah.
1492449 1494235 Ideas are the new sexy.
1496370 1498202 ["White Rabbit" continues playing]
1508549 1510210 Obviously <i>The Matrix</i> is about...
1510300 1512382 - trans-politics.<br />- Crypto-fascism.
1512553 1513553 It's a metaphor...
1513637 1515173 of capitalist exploitation.
1527860 1532024 This cannot be another reboot,<br />retread, regurgitated...
1532197 1534188 Why not? Reboots sell.
1537578 1539639 We are so far down<br />the wrong rabbit hole here, people.
1539663 1542701 You say <i>Matrix</i> to anyone...<br />You say <i>Matrix...</i>
1543500 1546367 [echoing] Matrix... Matrix... Matrix...
1546545 1548377 this is what they see.<br />[mimics explosion]
1548464 1550421 - [guns firing]<br />- [bullets whizzing]
1553594 1554629 [clicks tongue]
1554720 1557178 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
1557347 1559429 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1560142 1561142 That's two words.
1565314 1568306 We need a new "bullet time." [echoing]
1569568 1570979 [laughs maniacally]
1571070 1574859 We need to revolutionize gaming again.
1575032 1578696 Revolutionize gaming again! [echoing]
1581538 1583745 ["White Rabbit" continues]
1604728 1606264 [barista] Afternoon, Tiff.
1606438 1607438 The ushe?
1607606 1609893 You know what, Skroce? I'm going wild.
1610067 1611978 I'll have a cortado today.
1612611 1614443 Fly that freak flag.
1615239 1616855 Mind if I get that?
1617032 1618032 Oh, hi.
1619034 1620274 Hi.
1621286 1623243 [Tiffany] I remember wanting a family,
1623789 1626827 but was that because<br />that's what women are supposed to want?
1628043 1629843 How do you know<br />if you want something yourself
1629878 1632415 or if your upbringing<br />programmed you to want it?
1632840 1633840 Mm.
1635008 1639127 I pay my analyst a lot of money<br />to answer such questions for me.
1639596 1640802 Smart.
1640973 1644216 I should get more therapy<br />but honestly, I'm too goddamn tired.
1644810 1646426 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1648105 1650267 No. Never had kids.
1650440 1652898 Oh, right, I knew that.
1653360 1655647 - Sorry. I googled you.<br />- [chuckles]
1657823 1660190 So, what's it like<br />being a world-famous game designer?
1660367 1664364 - Must be amazing.<br />- Uh... A lot of hours.
1664538 1666495 Sometimes it is amazing.
1666665 1668121 Most times,
1669376 1670537 I don't know.
1670711 1673294 But you made <i>The Matrix.</i><br />Even I've heard of that.
1673463 1676376 Yeah. We kept some kids entertained.
1677301 1679292 - So, worth it?<br />- [chuckles]
1685767 1688134 Can I ask something about your game?
1688312 1689518 Sure.
1689688 1691895 Did you base your main character<br />on yourself?
1697154 1699065 There is a lot of me in him.
1699198 1701064 [indistinct shouting]
1701617 1704700 Maybe a little too much.
1706830 1708366 Can I ask you something else?
1708540 1709746 Please.
1711585 1713747 There's a woman in your game.
1714963 1715963 Trinity.
1717966 1720549 Which is a weird<br />coincidence also, right?
1722137 1723218 God, yeah.
1724640 1725846 I like her.
1727142 1728849 - I like Trinity.<br />- Ah.
1729519 1730725 And I dig her Ducati.
1730896 1733763 Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.
1735400 1736731 [engine revs]
1737277 1739689 My friend Kush and I<br />actually build them.
1739863 1740863 Really?
1740948 1743531 You have your analyst, I have my bikes.
1744785 1747493 So, I was looking at images<br />from your game.
1748163 1749163 At Trinity.
1750958 1754576 Well, I showed Chad a scene,<br />and I was like, "So, what do you think?"
1755796 1757628 He didn't get it until I said,
1758423 1760255 "Don't you think she looks like me?"
1762177 1763793 You know what he did?
1765180 1766386 He laughed.
1771270 1773978 And I laughed too, like it was a joke.
1774147 1775603 How could it not be, right?
1777859 1779441 Made me so angry.
1781071 1783278 I hated myself for laughing.
1785075 1788033 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1789371 1790452 Not too hard.
1790539 1793702 Maybe just hard enough<br />to break his jaw off.
1794042 1795157 [chuckles]
1797337 1799044 And right now,<br />you're probably regretting
1799131 1800542 sitting down with me.
1802926 1806294 This is the best thing I've done<br />in a long time.
1806722 1808087 [chuckles]
1809141 1810973 - [cell phone ringing]<br />- [gasps]
1811059 1812675 I have to take this.
1816356 1817356 Hi, this is Tiff.
1817524 1818605 Oh, God, no.
1818692 1819773 [gasps]
1820652 1822108 I'll be right there.
1822863 1825525 My... My, uh, youngest<br />stuck a Lego up his nose.
1826450 1827690 Oh.
1829161 1830161 I gotta go.
1832414 1834951 I hope I see you again.
1847846 1851589 [alarm blaring]
1853101 1855581 [announcer on speaker]<br /><i>There has been a report of an emergency.</i>
1855854 1859688 <i>Proceed calmly to the nearest exit<br />and leave the building immediately.</i>
1859858 1861098 What's going on?
1861276 1863196 We probably just got swatted<br />by some 14-year-old.
1863362 1864922 Yeah, someone pissed<br />about the latest update.
1864946 1865946 Or they're just a dick.
1866114 1869197 Please move to the exits.<br />Building's being evacuated.
1869284 1870524 [cell phone buzzes]
1884341 1887003 [suspenseful music playing]
1890472 1892054 [security guard] Sir, this way.
1897896 1899057 Jude?
1900607 1901642 Jude!
1908115 1910072 At last.
1911952 1913317 [chuckles] Ah.
1913412 1916530 I wasn't too sure about the callback,<br />but, you know, it was hard to resist.
1916873 1917908 What?
1918083 1919539 Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.
1919709 1921950 Lightning, thunder and theater.
1922129 1923665 At last.
1924256 1928420 All these years later, here's me,<br />strolling out of a toilet stall.
1928969 1930004 Tragedy or farce?
1930178 1931839 I know you.
1932013 1933799 Not every day you meet your maker.
1933974 1935089 This can't be happening.
1935267 1936928 Oh, most definitely is.
1937102 1939343 You can't be a character I coded.
1939521 1941512 One hundred percent natural.
1947154 1948360 [gasps softly]
1948989 1950024 How?
1950407 1952444 All the explanation you need.
1955662 1957278 Oh.
1957372 1958487 No.
1958665 1960531 No, no, no.
1960667 1962408 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />What do you mean, "no"?
1962586 1965169 You wanted this, you did this.<br />This was your idea.
1965255 1969374 [hesitating] It was a test.<br />An experiment.
1970719 1971880 An experiment?
1973555 1975387 You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,
1975557 1976718 left me to bang my head
1976808 1979140 till I nearly lost my shit<br />searching for you,
1979311 1980927 as an experiment.
1981104 1982999 - The exit's breaking down.<br />- He hasn't taken the pill.
1983023 1984354 What? There's no time.
1984524 1986185 I know, I know. He's having a moment.
1986735 1988655 Does he know<br />how hard it was to hack that mirror?
1989112 1991228 [tense music playing]
1991323 1992358 Still open.
1993074 1996533 This... This can't be real.

2004544 2005909 [grunting]
2006004 2007290 This isn't happening.
2007464 2009922 It's in my mind. It's in my mind.
2010091 2011691 [SWAT officer 2] Hey, you!<br />Stop! Hold it!
2013845 2015301 [all screaming]
2019017 2020758 [groaning]
2027234 2028724 This can't be happening.
2030695 2031810 - [gunshots]<br />- [gasps]
2031905 2033612 [SWAT officer 3] Freeze! Don't move!
2036159 2037274 [gun firing]

2094759 2095840 Neo!
2098263 2100300 [tense music builds]
2100807 2102923 [shouts] Mr. Anderson!
2103768 2104974 No.
2105145 2106145 It can't be.
2114988 2116774 I've missed you.
2123246 2124532 [cat meows]
2127500 2129161 [bell tinkling]
2132088 2133704 It's in my mind.
2134883 2136214 It's in my mind.
2142682 2143682 [cup clinking]
2144517 2145882 [analyst] Can you hear me, Thomas?
2147187 2149178 Follow my voice.
2150273 2153766 Feel the tips of your fingers.<br />What are they touching?
2153902 2155188 [bell tinkling]
2155779 2157144 The bell.
2159741 2161072 Do you hear the bell?
2164704 2167537 Do you remember what happened?<br />How you got here?
2169250 2170456 You must have walked.
2170627 2173085 I heard Déja Vu outside,<br />opened my door, and there you were.
2176966 2178001 [Thomas Anderson exhales]
2178593 2180800 You feel like you can talk about it?
2181513 2182782 When we started working together,
2182806 2187175 you had lost your capacity<br />to discern reality from fiction.
2187352 2190060 You came to me<br />after trying to jump off a building.
2190563 2192679 You said you wanted to fly away.
2195026 2197643 [indistinct chatter]
2201991 2203322 [people shouting]
2206246 2208908 We have made<br />a lot of progress since then,
2209082 2211289 but you seem<br />particularly triggered right now.
2211459 2212745 Can you tell me how it started?
2214796 2216457 He texted me.
2217632 2218918 Who?
2219092 2220503 Morpheus.
2220593 2221674 Ah.
2223430 2224761 So, he's back.
2224931 2227013 It wasn't actually him.
2228309 2230926 It was a program I coded for a Modal.
2231688 2233725 And this Modal, Morpheus,
2233898 2236014 came to help you escape
2236109 2239522 from a virtual reality<br />called <i>The Matrix?</i>
2249581 2250992 Am I crazy?
2251833 2253494 We don't use that word in here.
2254335 2256121 What word should I use?
2257464 2260456 What word explains<br />what is happening to me?
2260759 2262341 Can I see the texts?
2263303 2264759 [exhales]
2264846 2266336 They were erased.
2271811 2274974 If we got in my car<br />and drove to your office,
2275148 2276889 what do you think we'd find there?
2277066 2278101 Nothing.
2280945 2282902 Because there was no attack.
2284157 2285693 No one was Killed.
2286659 2288195 No one texted.
2288912 2290869 My mind made it all up.
2292457 2294539 Is that what I'm supposed to say?
2295126 2296537 Is that what you believe?
2297378 2298743 It felt real.
2299297 2300628 Of course.
2301341 2304254 It was your great ambition<br />to make a game
2304344 2306426 that was indistinguishable from reality.
2306679 2307679 To achieve this goal,
2307847 2310555 you converted elements of your life<br />into narrative.
2310934 2312925 Your sublimated anger toward<br />your business partner
2313102 2314718 cast him as your nemesis.
2315396 2319890 A married woman named Tiffany<br />became the Trinity of a doomed romance.
2320693 2324027 Even your dislike of my cat<br />made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>
2324864 2326480 There's nothing wrong with that.
2326658 2328114 It's what artists do.
2328284 2330241 But it becomes a problem
2330328 2333912 when fantasies<br />endanger us or other people.
2336334 2338496 We don't want anyone to get hurt,
2338670 2340001 do we, Thomas?
2348263 2350004 Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.
2350473 2352384 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
2353017 2354662 [Oracle] <i>No one can tell you<br />you're in love.</i>
2354686 2356973 You just know it, through and through.
2357146 2359103 Balls to bones.
2359858 2361474 [Trinity whispers] <i>You feel this?</i>
2363278 2364894 I'm never letting go.
2365822 2366937 [yells]
2367824 2368824 [both grunting]
2372787 2374619 [Morpheus] <i>You have to<br />let it all go, Neo.</i>
2374789 2377076 Free your mind.
2382672 2383672 [cell phone buzzing]
2384883 2385923 - [buzzing stops]<br />- [sighs]
2387051 2388212 [pigeon cooing]
2395852 2396887 Huh.
2397478 2399389 Looks easy enough.
2404068 2405068 [exhales]
2406321 2408858 "Free my mind." Shit.
2410742 2412403 [suspenseful music playing]
2414037 2415493 Okay.
2416205 2417570 Free my mind.
2423671 2424671 [grunts]
2433806 2435342 I fly...
2436309 2437720 or I fall.
2438353 2439718 [suspenseful music builds]
2441189 2442189 [grunts]
2443608 2444814 [both grunting]
2446069 2447230 Who the hell are you?
2448154 2450270 You won't remember me,
2450448 2452906 but a long time ago, you changed my life
2453743 2455609 when you leapt off another roof.
2456329 2459071 <i>Back then,<br />I was just like any other coppertop,</i>
2459165 2460576 <i>pretending my life</i>
2461000 2464288 until I looked up and I saw you.
2465254 2467586 <i>It was a different you, but I saw</i>
2468424 2469459 the real you,
2470301 2472008 just a second before...
2473513 2474594 you leapt.
2474681 2475796 [people shouting]
2479352 2481093 And you never fell.
2486567 2488558 Are you the one that hacked my Modal?
2489153 2490234 Yeah.
2490321 2491561 [cell phone buzzing]
2491698 2494440 That'll be Jude. He's not your friend.
2494534 2496294 He's a handle,<br />a program used to control you.
2496327 2499194 He's on his way here,<br />and he's bringing Agents with him.
2500665 2501746 Jude.
2501916 2505204 <i>Bro, I've been calling you all night.<br />We have a major problemo.</i>
2506796 2508332 Are you alone?
2511300 2513211 <i>That's kind of a sexy question, dude.</i>
2514178 2516340 [Bugs] They don't look like<br />typical Agents.
2516514 2517908 They use bots now,<br />skinned as normal people,
2517932 2520594 which means they're everywhere<br />and you never know who to trust.
2521477 2523138 Why should I trust you?
2525440 2528353 Because if they open that door,<br />we lose our hack.
2528526 2530108 I will be caught and killed
2530278 2532798 and you will be put right back<br />on that treadmill they designed for you
2532822 2535342 just like they did the last time<br />you tried to leap your way out.
2536701 2539068 I know why you left your Modal open.
2539245 2541361 You needed someone else<br />to free Morpheus.
2541873 2543851 And it's because of him<br />that we were able to get to you.
2543875 2547539 I know these things the same way<br />that I knew one day I would find you.
2548713 2551125 And that when I did,<br />you would be ready for this.
2555845 2557085 If you want the truth, Neo,
2558514 2560346 you're going to have to follow me.
2561893 2562893 Okay.
2566189 2567930 [dramatic music playing]
2580453 2582444 [upbeat music playing]
2582538 2585155 - Where are we?<br />- Tokyo.
2585333 2587074 A moving portal<br />makes it harder to track us.
2587251 2589618 - Seq is the best of them.<br />- [Seq] Portal's clean.
2589796 2591161 Reading no shadows.
2592757 2594339 I don't remember this.
2595510 2597592 We don't have to run<br />to phone booths anymore either.
2597720 2599757 [upbeat music playing]
2607230 2608595 Door's on your right.
2610483 2611518 [door opens]
2622912 2625153 Set and setting, right?
2625331 2626571 Oh, no.
2626749 2628114 It's all about set...
2629001 2630287 and setting.
2630461 2634455 After our first contact went so badly,<br />we thought elements from your past
2634632 2636112 might help ease you into the present.
2636175 2638837 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2639011 2640467 a little nostalgia.
2640638 2642800 This is footage from your game.
2650189 2652021 [Morpheus] Time is always against us,
2652984 2654941 etcetera, etcetera.
2656195 2660655 No one can be told what the Matrix is,<br />blah, blah, blah.
2663369 2665201 You gotta see it to believe it.
2668875 2669875 Time to fly.
2670585 2671871 [suspenseful music playing]
2672461 2673872 Wait.
2674046 2675046 If this is real,
2675214 2677956 if I haven't lost my mind,<br />does that mean
2679719 2681050 this happened?
2682013 2684630 [soft music playing]
2689937 2691519 But if it did,
2695693 2697149 then we died.
2697320 2699231 Obviously not.
2699405 2700816 Why the Machines kept you alive
2700990 2703732 and why they went<br />to such lengths to hide you
2703910 2705492 are questions we don't have answers to.
2705661 2706947 Hide me?
2707580 2711198 I've been at a company making<br />a game called <i>The Matrix.</i>
2711918 2714410 Doesn't seem like<br />they were trying to hide anything.
2714587 2716148 We've been tracking<br />that company for years.
2716172 2718789 We screened<br />every Thomas Anderson we found.
2718966 2722675 What we didn't understand<br />was that they could alter your DSI.
2723304 2725045 Pods generate your digital self-image
2725139 2727551 through a feedback system<br />called Semblance.
2727725 2729090 This is how you look to yourself.
2729852 2732719 Somehow they were able<br />to alter your DSI loop.
2733606 2735472 This is how everyone else sees you.
2736108 2738645 [suspenseful music playing]
2750081 2751992 Twenty years?
2753459 2756918 Why did it take 20 years to find me?
2757088 2758874 It took a lot longer than that.
2759048 2761005 It's been over 60 years<br />since you and Trinity
2761092 2762674 flew to one of the Machine Cities.
2763386 2764386 What?
2764553 2766260 There's so much we don't know.
2766806 2768638 Like why you've barely aged,
2768724 2770840 or how many times<br />they've altered your DSI.
2771018 2772371 [Morpheus] But based on what we do know,
2772395 2775228 it appears no one found you<br />because you didn't want to be found.
2775773 2778105 - That's not true.<br />- [Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.
2778526 2780966 Maybe there's no foundation<br />to the rumors that you disappeared
2781070 2782589 because you were<br />working with the Machines
2782613 2783613 from the beginning.
2783781 2784942 Morpheus, stop.
2785116 2788154 All I'm saying is this is the moment
2788327 2790659 for you to show us what is real.
2790830 2792616 If you want out,
2793165 2794451 you'll take this pill.
2796085 2798326 But if you are where you belong,
2798504 2800586 you can go back to this.
2800756 2802042 Every day.
2802216 2805754 Over and over, forever.
2809223 2810429 Fuck.
2812268 2815761 [dramatic music playing]
2820568 2821649 [Seq] Keep the loop tight.
2834248 2835434 [Bugs] Cybebe needs that tower pin.
2835458 2837199 I got a signal. It's faint.
2837376 2838741 It's definitely off-grid.
2845843 2848084 Captain. I'm tracking<br />a whole lot of weird.
2848262 2849593 - What?<br />- It's some kind of graft.
2855853 2857139 Thomas?
2858314 2860100 Oh, God.
2860733 2862223 Oh, no.
2863944 2865935 - We got company.<br />- How'd they find us?
2867365 2870278 Thomas, none of this is real.
2870451 2873660 You are in the midst<br />of a serious psychotic break.
2874580 2876491 - Lexy?<br />- Almost there.
2876665 2877871 Thomas?
2879001 2881618 Thomas, please. This is not a game.
2881796 2883252 Feel my hand.
2883422 2884537 This is what is real.
2887593 2889129 Stay with me.
2889512 2891048 [Thomas Anderson] No. No.
2894100 2895243 [analyst, distorted] Stay with me.
2895267 2896678 [distorted grunts]
2897812 2898812 Neo!
2902525 2903525 Morpheus!
2905194 2906480 [Morpheus] Let's go, let's go!
2923295 2925502 [people screaming]
2931637 2933002 [woman screaming]
2937059 2938970 - Bots are being activated.<br />- It's a swarm.
2939061 2940722 [grunting]
2941689 2943396 [yelling]
2952074 2953314 [woman screams]
2963210 2964291 [Bugs] Come on!

2973220 2974381 [grunting]
2984982 2986598 [whimpers]
2993407 2994989 [shrieking]
2997828 2999222 I got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry.
2999246 3000246 Yes.
3001040 3002040 Come on!
3004126 3005126 Seq, where?
3007338 3010421 - That mirror.<br />- What? We'll never fit.
3010508 3012235 You gotta fit, 'cause I don't have<br />another way off this train.
3012259 3013859 - [groans]<br />- [Morpheus] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3014345 3015835 I know. I know.
3016013 3018971 Think perspective.<br />Closer you are, bigger it gets.
3022561 3024177 Okay, come on.
3025481 3026687 In you go.

3141513 3142844 [softly] Trinity.
3148187 3149187 No.
3150397 3151933 [suspenseful music playing]

3230227 3233015 [echoing] Welcome back<br />to the real world.
3241572 3242653 Trinity.
3242823 3243688 What's up, Doc?
3243782 3245635 [woman] His vital systems<br />have been meticulously maintained,
3245659 3247445 but it doesn't look good.
3250622 3252033 [EKG beeping]
3253000 3255207 - We're losing him.<br />- Cold boot could shock him.
3255794 3256794 Do it.
3257045 3258456 [computer buzzing rapidly]
3259757 3260757 [groans]
3261842 3262842 [exhales]
3269975 3271431 I remember this.
3274146 3275636 The Construct.
3276523 3280649 In between<br />everything and nothing.
3281445 3283027 Welcome to the Crib.
3284823 3286655 I've been chilling here<br />in the ship network,
3290120 3291656 learning all about you.
3294541 3295781 [TV static]
3296376 3297491 And me.
3301465 3304002 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3305427 3308795 Are memories turned into fiction<br />any less real?
3312184 3315302 Is reality based in memory<br />nothing but fiction?
3315479 3317095 As to my role in all this,
3317189 3319772 my best guess is that you wrote me
3319858 3322065 as an algorithmic reflection<br />of two forces
3322236 3324352 that helped you become you,
3324822 3327735 Morpheus and Agent Smith.
3328325 3331989 A combo pack of counterprogramming<br />that was...
3332079 3333079 [inhales]
3334998 3337660 Let's just say,<br />more than a little bit crazy-making.
3338877 3341619 But it worked because here we are.
3342756 3344292 Now, for the bad news.
3344466 3346673 Your brain is hooked on this shit
3346844 3349461 <i>The Matrix</i> has been force-feeding you<br />for years.
3349638 3351345 Hooked bad.
3351515 3353075 You're going through major withdrawals.
3353141 3355473 Docbots are giving you crap odds<br />for surviving.
3356395 3358477 But, see, they don't know you like I do.
3361441 3363557 I know exactly what you need.
3365404 3367111 [lively music playing]
3385507 3386918 You gotta be kidding.
3387217 3388252 Uh-uh.
3389261 3390547 No joke.
3391388 3394631 Could be this is the first day<br />of the rest of your life.
3395434 3397175 But if you want it...
3398520 3399555 [water splashing]
3400898 3402138 You gotta fight for it.
3403358 3406225 No. I'm done fighting.
3407279 3408279 Are you?

3451698 3453029 What the hell is he doing?
3454326 3456988 Oh, yeah. They taught you good.
3459957 3461197 [Neo grunting]
3462668 3465786 Made you believe<br />their world was all you deserved.
3465963 3467829 But some part of you knew<br />that was a lie.
3468006 3470543 Some part of you<br />remembered what was real.
3473345 3474460 You don't know me.
3475097 3476097 No?
3476264 3477299 [both grunting]

3518890 3519800 I know you,
3519891 3522091 because I know the only thing<br />that still matters to you.
3522769 3525136 I know it's why you're here,<br />why you're still fighting
3525897 3527387 and why you will never give up.
3527482 3528768 [both grunting]
3537242 3538698 [Neo groaning]

3541580 3542866 Come on, Neo!
3544332 3545493 This is it.
3547711 3549076 This is your last chance.

3557345 3560145 You gotta fight for your goddamn life<br />if you want to see Trinity again.
3560182 3561843 [Neo groaning]
3565062 3566348 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3569107 3571599 - Holy shit.<br />- Fight for her!
3571693 3573275 [yelling]
3576031 3577192 [explosion]
3587167 3588167 [gasps]
3597552 3598552 [sighs]
3623745 3625361 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3627332 3628788 Mind if I...
3642013 3643469 How are you doing?
3645142 3647133 If this plug is actually real,
3649229 3651436 that means they took my life...
3652524 3653730 [scoffs]
3654151 3656358 And turned it into a video game.
3659573 3661109 How am I doing?
3662117 3663403 I don't know.
3664327 3666364 I don't even know how to know.
3667539 3668950 That's it, isn't it?
3670584 3672666 If we don't know what's real,
3674796 3675877 we can't resist.
3678884 3681838 They took your story,<br />something that meant
3683013 3685175 so much to people like me,
3686975 3689467 and turned it into something trivial.
3691354 3693061 That's what the Matrix does.
3693982 3696098 It weaponizes every idea.
3696902 3698267 Every dream.
3699946 3701562 Everything that's important to us.
3704284 3705365 Where better to bury truth
3705452 3708911 than inside something<br />as ordinary as a video game?
3709664 3711575 That sounds like the Oracle.
3711666 3712701 [Bugs chuckles]
3713043 3714750 Heard so much about her.
3717672 3719083 She was gone before I was free.
3720759 3721759 Gone?
3721927 3725045 When this new version of the Matrix<br />was uploaded,
3726640 3728096 there was a purge.
3730894 3732055 [sighs]
3733188 3736726 They promised peace<br />and they gave us purge.
3738193 3739228 No.
3739778 3741439 No, there was peace.
3743073 3747237 You made it possible,<br />and it changed everything.
3748203 3750865 Doesn't feel like it changed anything.
3751831 3754323 The Matrix is the same or worse.
3755085 3757167 And I'm back where I started.
3760048 3762380 It feels like everything I did,
3763468 3764924 everything we did...
3769015 3770015 [both grunt]
3771059 3773141 like none of it mattered.
3775438 3777020 All of it mattered.
3778817 3780273 I can show you.
3790996 3792532 This is my crew.
3795750 3797832 Our operator, Seq.
3800213 3803547 Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.
3804050 3805461 Nice to meet you.
3806594 3808084 Dad loved redwoods.
3808722 3811589 When he escaped the Matrix<br />and found out they no longer existed,
3811683 3812764 it almost killed him.
3813226 3814387 Lucky he met Mom,
3815312 3816393 and here I am.
3817105 3820689 This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.
3821443 3822604 Hi.
3822777 3825269 You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.
3825447 3827779 Roland was your grandfather?
3828616 3830776 He always laughed,<br />joking how he never believed in you.
3831911 3835029 But, in private, he said<br />that you freed his mind a second time.
3835665 3837747 Uh, not to fanboy out here,
3837834 3839745 but this is kind of<br />a huge moment for me.
3839919 3841785 Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.
3842339 3843625 A what?
3843798 3846836 There's a lot of people<br />out there like me
3846926 3849133 who are a little bit obsessed<br />with your life.
3849304 3851741 I would never have recognized your Modal<br />if it weren't for him.
3851765 3854974 Whenever you're feeling up for it,<br />I've got, like, a million questions.
3855143 3857475 Me too. Starting with them.
3858855 3859855 [Bugs] It's okay.
3860648 3861648 Come meet him.
3861983 3863189 This is Cybebe.
3863360 3864771 That's Octacles.
3864944 3866935 - That's Lumin8.<br />- [chittering]
3867697 3869813 Machines are on our side now?
3869991 3872949 They are synthients.<br />It's a word they prefer to Machines.
3873119 3876453 Your contact with the Synthient City<br />had a huge impact on their world.
3876915 3877995 [Bugs] That's what I meant.
3878041 3880954 What you changed that nobody believed<br />could ever be changed.
3883004 3885120 The meaning of "our side."
3885548 3886879 [Cybebe warbling softly]
3889344 3892257 Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives<br />to help get you out.
3893723 3894723 Thank you.
3896267 3897267 But why?
3897352 3899093 [Morpheus] Not all seek to control.
3900146 3902012 Just as not all wish to be free.
3903858 3904939 What is that?
3905110 3907522 An exomorphic-particle codex.<br />It's pretty new.
3907695 3910778 It gives programs access to this world.<br />Within limits.
3910949 3913941 Limits are the domain of the limited.
3914119 3915200 Morpheus.
3915745 3916745 Thank you.
3916913 3918278 It was my honor.
3920166 3921406 [chuckles] Wow.
3921584 3922728 - [crew chuckles]<br />- How does it work?
3922752 3924117 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3924295 3926662 If you want,<br />I can download the codex manual for you.
3926840 3929081 - Sure.<br />- Downloading used to be fun.
3929509 3931375 Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.
3931886 3933502 Can I ask them something?
3936641 3939554 When you unplugged me,<br />there was another pod?
3939811 3941051 [warbling softly]
3941146 3943888 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3945150 3946436 It could be Trinity.
3947318 3948524 It's her.
3949154 3951566 I figured we were going to<br />have this conversation.
3952282 3955149 Look, you were not<br />a typical flush-and-grab.
3955326 3957738 You were in this weird tower<br />that Cybebe had never accessed,
3957829 3958990 and she's now exiled.
3959164 3961201 We burned our one shot for you.
3961749 3963686 Even if it were Trinity<br />and she wanted to be free,
3963710 3965576 we have no idea how to do it.
3965753 3966753 Yet.
3969340 3971547 Nobody believed we'd ever find him,
3972177 3973177 but we did.
3975597 3976712 Okay.
3977765 3980723 We don't know how to get her out... yet.
3982979 3985437 Captain, we're approaching<br />security clearance.
3986774 3987774 We're here.
3988026 3989026 Zion?
3997160 3998275 Have a seat.
3998786 4001403 This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.
4001581 4003913 Quite a few synthients<br />deserve that title before me.
4004083 4005769 [Control on radio]<br />Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared for landing.</i>
4005793 4006793 <i>Welcome home.</i>
4006878 4008460 [Hanno] Thank you, Control.
4008630 4010120 Um, we're about to crash.
4011174 4013040 [dramatic music playing]
4015845 4017051 [chuckles]
4017138 4020506 General realized we were never going to<br />beat the Sentinels,
4020683 4022640 so we just got better at<br />hiding from them.
4027273 4028809 Welcome to Io.
4030443 4031558 Io.
4032028 4033735 [sweeping music playing]
4038368 4041030 Wow. That looks real.
4041538 4043120 Bio-sky.
4046834 4048541 Works kind of like grow lights.
4049295 4050911 It's way more complex than that.
4051089 4053456 It pulls water from the crust,<br />hydronating the air.
4053633 4056751 It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles.
4057887 4059173 Plus... [sighs]
4060056 4061763 It is pretty to look at.
4061933 4063674 As opposed to that.
4065144 4067556 I guess the general<br />sent us a welcome party.
4085832 4087243 God damn.
4088376 4089537 It is you.
4090420 4091581 Niobe?
4093590 4096332 A few more wrinkles<br />and a few less teeth,
4097302 4100840 but wise enough to know<br />I don't know anything.
4101014 4103506 I sure as shit never saw this coming.
4104392 4105473 Neither did I.
4105643 4106758 I told you he was alive.
4106936 4109052 Captain, you and your crew<br />have been grounded.
4109230 4110666 General, if you'd just let me explain.
4110690 4113478 The protocols are put in place<br />for everyone's protection.
4113651 4116939 I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity<br />and I was afraid we'd lose him.
4117113 4119650 But, General,<br />people have been waiting for so long.
4121367 4122573 We found The One.
4124495 4126111 I don't believe in The One.
4128416 4129497 I never did.
4130168 4131249 No?
4132378 4133709 Me neither.
4134047 4138587 But there was a time<br />when you trusted me with your ship,
4139302 4141009 against the Council's orders.
4141179 4143136 The world was different then.
4145058 4146594 We were different.
4148728 4150059 Report to the docks.
4150229 4151845 Scrub down the <i>Mnemosyne.</i>
4152023 4154185 Transfer your access codes.
4154359 4155770 You are done, Captain.
4155860 4156860 [gasps softly]
4165453 4167239 We need to talk.
4172543 4174705 [Niobe] When word first came,
4175338 4177454 that it actually might be you,
4181427 4185011 I didn't know how I would feel<br />in this moment.
4192980 4194937 It is nice to see you.
4195108 4197645 - It's good to see you too.<br />- [glasses clink]
4203700 4206362 A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.
4206452 4208864 [chuckles] Yes.
4209497 4211158 A lot has changed.
4212750 4214616 Except maybe you.
4217505 4218961 You remember this?
4226222 4230762 It's so easy to forget how much noise<br />the Matrix pumps into your head
4230935 4232300 until you unplug.
4232812 4234052 [Neo sighs]
4234147 4235182 Yeah.
4235815 4238557 Something else<br />makes the same kind of noise.
4238735 4240817 Takes over every damn thing
4240987 4242603 just like the Matrix.
4244282 4245282 War.
4247160 4249618 I stood at the barricade of the Temple.
4251581 4253697 Staring at the army of Sentinels,
4254959 4257451 waiting for them to Kill<br />every one of us.
4259005 4261997 But then, they left.
4263301 4265633 They said you saved us.
4265803 4267009 I didn't believe it.
4267180 4270343 Every night I would dream<br />of attack sirens.
4271017 4272257 But then,
4274937 4277053 I would wake up to this...
4281068 4282524 silence.
4286073 4287655 I'm ashamed of it now.
4287825 4291693 My pessimism<br />of how long it took me to believe
4291871 4294954 a world without war was possible.
4296417 4297953 You gave me that.
4298544 4300876 You gave that gift to us all.
4301631 4305090 And it is the gift<br />that continues to bear fruit.
4307887 4309548 Come help me get up.
4309722 4311338 Let's take a walk.
4311766 4314679 [mysterious music playing]
4324445 4325901 [elevator door opens]
4335540 4337497 Oh! Beautiful.
4338709 4341667 This is Freya, head of botany.
4341838 4344830 And this is Quillion,<br />our lead digitologist.
4345174 4349088 I presume<br />our guest needs no introduction.
4349262 4351720 Nothing travels faster than light.
4351889 4353129 Except gossip.
4353224 4354224 [Freya chuckles]
4355560 4356891 Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
4358980 4360186 A strawberry?
4360356 4364350 Using digital code from the Matrix,<br />we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.
4364527 4365983 And they grow here?
4366153 4370317 It's not easy augmenting the genome<br />to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...
4370491 4372073 - We're getting there.<br />- [chuckles]
4372869 4374530 Go ahead. Try it.
4380710 4381996 [Niobe chuckles]
4382086 4384327 We're quite excited<br />about the blueberries.
4384505 4386291 You remember that shit we used to eat?
4386465 4388706 That slop that tasted like rust.
4390511 4393845 Zion could have never<br />made something like this.
4394015 4395346 Why?
4395808 4398049 Because we needed synthients
4398436 4400473 and DI like him.
4400646 4403855 Zion was stuck in the past.<br />Stuck in war.
4404025 4406062 Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
4406569 4410233 They believed<br />that it had to be us or them.
4410406 4415070 This city was built<br />by us and them.
4420833 4422415 What happened to Zion?
4422585 4425794 I've been waiting<br />for you to ask that question.
4428007 4431341 All of the troubles<br />started in the Machine Cities.
4431510 4434753 Power plants were unable<br />to produce enough energy.
4435306 4438844 Nothing can breed violence<br />like scarcity.
4440645 4442261 For the first time,
4442438 4445476 <i>we saw machines at war with one another.</i>
4448736 4452479 We got word from the Oracle<br />of a new power rising.
4454617 4457109 That was the last we heard from her.
4460831 4461992 Morpheus.
4462166 4466626 [Niobe] After the siege,<br />he was elected unanimously.
4466796 4468787 High Chair of the Council.
4469799 4472791 Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]
4473344 4477338 But as rumors of this new power spread,
4477515 4478721 he ignored them.
4478891 4483260 He was certain what you had done<br />could not be undone.
4483938 4487602 All of these people<br />never stopped believing in miracles,
4487775 4490107 believing in you.
4502206 4503537 I'm sorry.
4505543 4507910 How could I know this would happen?
4508087 4510169 We didn't understand<br />all of it back then.
4510339 4511955 No more than we do now.
4512383 4515466 I didn't come here<br />to cause you problems, Niobe,
4516595 4518256 but I need your help.
4519974 4521430 Trinity is alive.
4521600 4523216 Then there is another question.
4523394 4525055 Why did they keep her alive?
4525229 4526435 I can't answer that.
4526605 4529814 But if there's a chance I can free her,
4529984 4531645 I have to try.
4531819 4535483 Even if it means<br />endangering everyone in this city?
4539785 4541116 I'm sorry, Neo.
4541746 4545205 I won't let what happened to Zion<br />happen to Io.
4547168 4550832 I hope you'll forgive an old woman<br />for asking you to go with Sheperd here,
4551797 4554255 till we have better understanding<br />of what's going on.
4554925 4557758 You're going to imprison me<br />after I just got free?
4557928 4560795 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4561807 4563798 but neither does growing old.
4564769 4566726 But you don't hear me complaining.
4569565 4571021 [elevator whirring]
4578741 4579822 Sorry.
4580785 4582696 I've never met a legend before.
4586082 4587163 Neo.
4588584 4589665 Sheperd. [breathes shakily]
4590377 4591538 [chuckles in disbelief]
4591629 4593415 Crazy. You're real.
4595382 4596497 "Real."
4597635 4599592 There's that word again.
4605309 4607149 [Sheperd] People talk a lot<br />about the old days.
4607645 4609761 About you, the viral Agent.
4609939 4611555 The siege of Zion.
4612775 4614607 Everything was simpler back then.
4615694 4617184 People wanted to be free.
4619323 4620609 It's different now.
4621450 4624738 Sometimes it feels like people gave up.
4626080 4627161 Like the Matrix won.
4627832 4629072 [unlocks door]
4630543 4631908 This is you.
4636006 4638213 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4640344 4641960 Is it true you could fly?
4646809 4647809 Cool.
4652857 4654063 [locks door]
4667538 4668869 [trickling]
4677256 4678291 [Morpheus grunts]
4678382 4679463 Morpheus.
4679675 4682633 Oh. General stuck you<br />in the Rapunzel tower.
4684013 4685128 [Morpheus exhales]
4685222 4686712 On the upside, it's a nice view.
4686891 4688928 What happened to Bugs and the others?
4689101 4691809 They're supposed to be sterilizing<br />the <i>Mnemosyne</i> with a toothbrush.
4691896 4692896 "Supposed to be"?
4693022 4694416 Well, I could tell you<br />that they're standing by,
4694440 4697558 waiting for you to make the choice<br />to remain meekly incarcerated
4697735 4699851 or bust the hell out of here<br />and go and find Trinity.
4701530 4702530 But that ain't a choice.
4704533 4706865 [dramatic music playing]
4715336 4717293 [Sheperd] General, what should we do?
4720925 4723383 [Freya] Bugs has the same<br />independence of mind
4723469 4724925 she had the day you freed her.
4725095 4727883 This is not independence of mind.
4728057 4729057 It's mutiny.
4730476 4731476 [Freya] Come on, 'Be.
4731894 4734807 I know how much you hated<br />locking him up.
4734980 4737597 Just like I know there's a part of you
4737775 4740642 that's relieved now that he's gone.
4742279 4745943 We've worked so hard to keep Io safe.
4748744 4750326 This scares me.
4760923 4762163 That's her.
4762341 4763376 [Seq] On the bridge.
4763884 4764919 Got her.
4771725 4773636 [engine revving]
4773727 4775934 It's sick how the Semblance works.
4776105 4777595 You see flashes of the real her,
4777773 4780390 but the way she reads...
4782278 4784736 Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.
4786824 4789691 This is a tough question, Neo,<br />but it has to be asked.
4790995 4792986 What if she's happy where she is?
4794540 4795701 How did I read?
4797835 4799701 Exactly like her.
4803590 4805251 Take us to broadcast depth.
4805884 4808216 [suspenseful music playing]
4817104 4818469 Thank you for helping me.
4820274 4822106 Most of us are here because of you.
4824862 4827445 I also admit our only chance<br />to get out of the general's doghouse
4827614 4829104 is for you to find your mojo.
4830951 4833409 What if I can't be what I once was?
4835122 4836683 - Then we're all fucked.<br />- [signal beeps]
4836707 4838038 [Hanno] Two minutes.
4838208 4839494 Two minutes to broadcast.
4848886 4850113 [Seq] I slipped you in<br />through a hotel room.
4850137 4851844 [Seq chuckles]
4851930 4853295 Should be safe.
4864151 4865266 Portal's open.
4865444 4867684 Closest I could get you<br />is the warehouse near her garage.
4868072 4869437 Whole zone's crawling with bots.
4870824 4872360 Let's go.
4899728 4901344 So, what do you think of him?
4903065 4905602 I was kinda worried at first<br />because he's so much older.
4905776 4908313 The beard, the hair... Oh.
4908487 4911104 - No, totally works for me.<br />- [scoffs] You idiot.
4911865 4913151 I mean "The One" thing.
4915035 4917402 You know, everyone that<br />shipped with him died.
4918080 4920663 Oh, yeah. He's gonna<br />get us all killed for sure.
4924211 4925211 [guns cocking]
4926088 4927578 Predictable as ever.
4929842 4931207 Smith.
4931760 4933671 Smith? As in, <i>the</i> Smith?
4934096 4935096 [chuckles]
4942229 4943310 This is so insane.
4943480 4944874 There's so many theories<br />about the two of them
4944898 4946514 and they're standing right there.
4946692 4948228 This code is freaky.
4948402 4951144 He's like an Agent, but not.
4955409 4956899 An appeal to reason.
4961206 4962696 How did you find us?
4962875 4964991 You never appreciated our relationship.
4965794 4967125 Not like The Analyst.
4967296 4969207 - The what?<br />- My doctor.
4969381 4972999 He used our bond<br />and turned it into a chain.
4973177 4974737 It's so obvious once you see it, right?
4974803 4977636 But this whole altered-code update<br />really blew my mind.
4978390 4980222 I still don't know how he did it.
4980392 4982599 You, as a balding nerd.
4983228 4984434 Hilarious.
4985063 4986895 And me... [sighs]
4987524 4989356 Even more perfect.
4990444 4992338 Maybe a little too far<br />on the piercing blue eyes.
4992362 4993602 What do you think?
4994406 4996272 What do you want, Smith?
4998494 5002112 I have such dreams, Tom. Big dreams.
5002873 5005456 Well, mostly just extremely violent<br />revenge fantasies,
5005626 5006853 but in order for me to pursue mine,
5006877 5009084 I need to dissuade you<br />from pursuing yours.
5009171 5012709 Hmm. Sounds like conflict.
5014468 5015958 Inevitable?
5017262 5018593 Doesn't have to be.
5018764 5020880 All you have to do<br />is stay out of the Matrix,
5020974 5022430 and leave the good doctor to me.
5022601 5024717 You can have him. I'm here for Trinity.
5024895 5026431 That's the trouble, Tom.
5026605 5028846 He knew you'd come, just like I did.
5029191 5030773 [scoffs]
5030859 5032065 Trust me.
5033111 5034442 You're not ready for him.
5034613 5037446 Captain, I'm reading portals<br />from the lower frequencies.
5042913 5045905 I won't have his leash on my neck again.
5053590 5055627 I found some old acquaintances of yours.
5056760 5060048 - Bugs!<br />- [growling]
5065561 5066722 [ominous music playing]
5071191 5072272 [snarls]
5073777 5074812 Exiles.
5074903 5076130 I thought they were all purged.
5076154 5077235 [man] You?
5077739 5078854 [excitedly] Oh!
5078949 5080906 It is you!
5081410 5082491 [man speaking French]
5082578 5086162 All these years. I can't believe it.
5086832 5088448 Oh, God.
5088625 5092493 You stole my life!
5092671 5094457 [speaking French]
5097509 5098987 [in English] What the Merv<br />is trying to say is that
5099011 5101469 their situation<br />is a little bit like mine.
5101638 5103675 To have their lives back,<br />yours has to end.
5105309 5106674 [bullet whizzing]
5107352 5108352 Kill him!
5108604 5110265 [tense music playing]
5114151 5115151 [blade slicing]
5116320 5117810 [all grunting]
5121700 5127286 You ruined every<br />suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5127456 5129993 We had grace.
5135088 5136578 We had style!
5136757 5138748 We had conversation!
5138925 5140757 Not this... [mimics text message sound]
5140844 5142460 [all grunting]
5153190 5154305 - [bone cracks]<br />- [yells]
5165410 5168778 Art, films, books were all better!
5168955 5172118 Originality mattered!
5172292 5174158 You gave us Face-Zucker-suck
5174336 5177624 and<br />Couch-flix-climatey-Wiki-piss-and-shit!
5198402 5199608 [screams]
5207452 5209113 [screaming]
5210038 5211824 [ominous music builds]
5222259 5223259 [man groans]
5223844 5225334 I still know kung fu.
5227222 5228222 Neo!
5229224 5230385 [Smith yells]
5239609 5240849 [both grunting]
5258003 5259414 Just like old times.
5264176 5265507 [tense music playing]
5285781 5286896 [Neo groaning]
5290619 5291905 [woman shrieks]
5298585 5299825 [man yelling]
5317062 5318097 Neo.
5320190 5322181 I've been thinking about us, Tom.
5322984 5326067 About binaries that form<br />the nature of things.
5327405 5328645 Ones and zeros.
5328740 5329821 [grunting]
5329908 5330943 Light and dark.
5333161 5335152 Choice and its absence.
5335247 5336282 [Smith grunts]
5338583 5340745 Anderson and Smith.
5342879 5344495 [dramatic music playing]
5375370 5376405 [gasps]
5377497 5379579 You've lost something, Tom.
5383712 5385373 You're not what you used to be.
5386673 5387708 It's true.
5391970 5393131 [grunts]
5396933 5398298 [jaw cracks]
5401146 5403057 - Nice one.<br />- Thanks.
5410947 5412108 Come on, Neo.
5427088 5429045 [Neo groaning]
5432594 5433675 [panting]
5434679 5435714 [gasps]
5437140 5439222 Captain. You okay?
5439768 5442009 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5442812 5443847 Smith is killing him.
5444022 5445183 [Bugs] Where?
5445482 5446722 [Neo groaning]
5452948 5454859 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5457661 5459572 After all,<br />you are the one who set me free...
5460872 5461872 again.
5464000 5466708 So you, more than anyone,<br />understands why I can't go back.
5467671 5468671 [grunts]
5469464 5471080 You should have listened to me.
5473426 5475042 Now you'll never see her again.
5476554 5477589 [grunts]
5479724 5481010 [yells]
5481184 5482219 [energy explodes]
5488692 5489773 What was that?
5489943 5491274 That was Neo.
5492946 5493981 Mojo rising.
5494072 5495233 [Lumin8 chittering]
5495323 5496404 [Seq exclaims]
5502038 5503324 [Bugs] You all right?
5503498 5504498 Yeah.
5505208 5507648 - It's gonna trigger a response.<br />- I got multiple exits ready.
5507711 5509271 [The Merovingian] This is not over yet!
5509295 5511787 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5512007 5514169 [speaking French]
5514509 5515509 [spits]
5519014 5520254 [Bugs] We should go.
5520432 5521593 I can't.
5521766 5523677 I have to talk to her.
5523852 5527095 Neo, those Exiles were older than you,<br />and we barely handled them.
5527981 5529142 [sighs]
5530775 5532231 You really wanna do this now?
5537657 5538863 I mean...
5542912 5544277 you look like shit.
5544581 5546822 [buzzing]
5555842 5558209 Oh, my God. What? What happened?
5558386 5559467 An accident.
5559637 5561844 [Tiffany] Kush. Call a doctor.
5562015 5563505 It's fine.
5564517 5566133 I don't have a lot of time.
5566811 5568393 I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5568563 5571021 After we spoke, I realized
5571941 5573932 my life wasn't a life.
5575528 5580489 At some point, I think I gave up<br />searching for something real.
5586831 5588117 Wait.
5589667 5591283 Something happened.
5592420 5594627 I looked for you at the coffee shop.
5596549 5598756 I began to wonder if I imagined you.
5600095 5602086 And then last night I had a dream.
5603223 5605339 <i>In the dream,<br />you were surrounded by police,</i>
5605517 5607053 then they started chasing us.
5608228 5611061 - Us?<br />- You were on my bike with me.
5613274 5614605 How did it end?
5616027 5617188 Not good.
5619906 5623194 I've had dreams<br />that weren't just dreams.
5623368 5625484 You mean a dream that came true?
5628039 5629905 [bell tinkling]
5630667 5633159 [suspenseful music playing]
5633336 5635794 Finally, we can talk like adults.
5637632 5640590 I hate lying. I do.<br />It exhausts me.
5642554 5645888 Tiff and I have been waiting for you,<br />like, forever.
5645974 5648341 [distorted rewinding]
5652939 5654179 Déjà vu, right?
5656151 5658267 Oh, no use. You can't beat time.
5658444 5661937 This rewind is happening<br />faster than you can blink.
5666911 5668822 You gave me the idea.
5671833 5674951 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
5678047 5679082 "Bullet time."
5679299 5680960 [grunts in slow motion]
5681050 5683087 I know. Kind of ironic,
5683261 5686799 using the power that defined you<br />to control you. [chuckles]
5687098 5689681 I kept such a close eye on you
5689851 5691467 and, still, you found a way out.
5692478 5694719 Clever monkey, using that Modal.
5695773 5698014 Call me an optimist,<br />but this could all be for the best.
5699360 5701772 The skin's not looking<br />too bad this time.
5702363 5704775 I know some of this<br />will be difficult for you to hear,
5704949 5706314 after everything you went through.
5706492 5707698 All that pain and suffering,
5707869 5710657 only to learn<br />the world doesn't end when you do.
5712207 5713288 Surprise.
5717170 5718535 [Neo grunts]
5719380 5720745 I was there when you died.
5720840 5722706 [Neo screaming]
5723259 5727719 I said to myself,<br />"Here is the anomaly of anomalies."
5727889 5730506 What an extraordinary opportunity.
5732310 5735143 First, I had to convince the Suits<br />to let me rebuild the two of you.
5735313 5738556 Why her? Getting there.<br />And don't worry, she can't hear me.
5738983 5741896 Resurrecting you both<br />was crazy expensive.
5742070 5743435 Like renovating a house.
5743613 5745650 Took twice as long, cost twice as much.
5748493 5749493 [gasps]
5749577 5752194 I thought you'd be happy<br />to be alive again.
5753248 5754613 So wrong.
5754707 5756289 - [machine whirring]<br />- [screaming]
5756376 5759960 Did you know hope and despair<br />are nearly identical in code?
5760046 5761582 [screaming]
5762006 5763997 We worked for years
5764175 5765711 <i>trying to activate your source code.</i>
5765885 5769094 I was about to give up,<br />when I realized...
5772183 5773218 Trinity.
5773393 5775600 It was never just you.
5775770 5778432 Alone, neither of you<br />is of any particular value.
5778773 5780355 [Trinity screaming]
5780441 5783559 Like acids and bases,<br />you're dangerous when mixed together.
5784195 5786357 Every sim where you two bonded,
5787240 5789197 let's just say bad things happened.
5791244 5792700 Neo!
5797166 5800284 However, as long as I managed<br />to keep you close,
5800461 5802168 but not too close,
5802338 5804579 I discovered something incredible.
5805633 5809092 Now, my predecessor loved precision.
5809262 5812675 His Matrix was all fussy facts<br />and equations.
5812849 5814590 He hated the human mind.
5814767 5817454 So he never bothered to realize<br />that you don't give a shit about facts.
5817478 5818889 It's all about fiction.
5819063 5823022 The only world that matters<br />is the one in here.
5823860 5826648 And you people believe<br />the craziest shit.
5827196 5828196 Why?
5828364 5831106 What validates<br />and makes your fictions real?
5832076 5833157 Feelings.
5834370 5835781 Allow me.
5837290 5838826 Kush here is one of my handlers.
5839000 5840240 They're everywhere.
5840418 5843080 Such a pain,<br />cloning Agents over a coppertop.
5843254 5845461 Far more effective<br />just to saturate a population.
5847550 5850292 And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.
5850386 5851547 [chuckles]
5858603 5860014 [gun fires in slow motion]
5862732 5865815 Ooh! Nicely done.
5867445 5870107 You ever wonder why you have nightmares?
5870782 5873365 Why your own brain tortures you?
5873826 5876614 It's actually us,<br />maximizing your output.
5877330 5878445 It works just like this.
5878623 5881160 Oh, no. Can you stop the bullet?
5881334 5884326 If only you could move faster.
5884420 5886878 [chuckles] Here's the thing<br />about feelings.
5887048 5889130 They're so much easier to control<br />than facts.
5890176 5892087 Turns out, in my Matrix,
5892261 5895549 the worse we treat you,<br />the more we manipulate you,
5895723 5898055 the more energy you produce.
5898226 5899808 It's nuts. [chomps]
5900603 5903470 I've been setting productivity records<br />every year since I took over.
5903648 5906310 And, the best part, zero resistance.
5906484 5907770 People stay in their pods,
5907944 5910311 happier than pigs in shit.
5911072 5912153 The key to it all?
5912323 5913563 You.
5913741 5914981 And her.
5915159 5917366 Quietly yearning<br />for what you don't have,
5917453 5919410 while dreading losing what you do.
5919872 5923911 For 99.9% of your race,<br />that is the definition of reality.
5924377 5926334 Desire and fear, baby.
5927463 5930205 Just give the people<br />what they want, right?
5931384 5932715 [squelches]
5939684 5942392 She's the only home you have, Thomas.
5942854 5946017 Come home<br />before something terrible happens.
5946107 5948314 [tense music playing]
5951320 5952810 [Neo grunts]
5954740 5955901 [keyboard clacking]
5956451 5957451 - Bugs!<br />- I hear him.
5957910 5960743 - [sirens approaching]<br />- [tires screech]
5964041 5965041 Trinity!
5965126 5966992 - You shouldn't call me that.<br />- I'm sorry.
5968546 5969707 I have to go.
5969881 5970996 But I'll be back.
5972175 5974416 Neo! Time to go.
5975553 5976918 - [gasps]<br />- [alarm blaring]
5977013 5978469 - Sentinels?<br />- Worse.
5980266 5982411 [Sheperd on radio] <i>General ordered me<br />to look after the ship.</i>
5982435 5983435 So you shadowed us?
5984437 5985927 Check your long-range scans.
5986105 5987937 <i>Squids are combing this area.</i>
5988107 5989188 He's right.
5989692 5992730 You can stay here and die,<br />or come back and face a court-martial.
5993404 5995315 And you call that a choice?
6002788 6004825 [Niobe] Sheperd should have left you<br />to the Squids.
6004999 6008117 I'm too damn old<br />to sit through some boring-ass trial.
6008294 6009409 Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
6009587 6011123 Do shut your mouth.
6011589 6013921 Do address me as General.
6014091 6018210 And do not rob my ex-captain<br />of her agency,
6018387 6020378 which she exercised with her own
6020473 6023807 particular brand<br />of shortsighted stupidity.
6025102 6026137 Shortsighted?
6028064 6031853 You care more about growing fruit<br />than freeing minds.
6032026 6034438 We are not going<br />to have this argument again.
6034612 6036444 It's not an argument. It's a fact.
6036948 6038063 You gave up on people.
6039700 6041907 I tell you what I'm going to give up on,
6041994 6043029 and it's you!
6045581 6048573 - Sheperd, get her out of my sight.<br />- General.
6050503 6051538 Disarm!
6051712 6053294 Kujaku's a friend.
6057969 6059300 [Kujaku warbling]
6059887 6061377 Hello, friend.
6061639 6062879 [chittering softly]
6064058 6065058 Okay.
6066394 6067600 Him?
6074527 6075858 General.
6076362 6077602 Thank you for seeing me.
6077780 6081774 I figured if there was anyone<br />who could make sense of this mess,
6081951 6083658 it would be you.
6083828 6084863 Hello, Neo.
6085037 6086493 I know you.
6087039 6088905 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6091168 6092168 [clicks tongue]
6092253 6093493 Why?
6093671 6095332 We met a long time ago.
6097091 6098126 Good morning.
6100970 6101970 Sati.
6102138 6104175 My father knew we'd meet again,
6104849 6106969 though he would have wished<br />for happier circumstances.
6107852 6109572 His inadvertent role<br />in what happened to you
6109687 6111769 was the greatest regret of his life.
6111939 6113725 I don't understand.
6115234 6118067 My father was the chief engineer<br />at the Anomaleum.
6118237 6119693 [Niobe] The what?
6119864 6122481 My father designed the resurrection pods
6122992 6124733 where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.
6126829 6127829 [Niobe] I'm sorry.
6128247 6129737 You knew what happened to him?
6129915 6132907 You knew that he and Trinity<br />both were alive,
6134003 6135334 and you didn't tell me?
6135504 6138166 There were times<br />I doubted my decision, Niobe.
6138341 6139957 But Io needed you.
6140134 6143468 This city needed to be built<br />for your people as well as mine.
6144805 6146261 If I would have told you everything,
6146682 6148682 you would have had<br />a very difficult choice to make.
6148768 6150304 My friends
6151729 6153891 let me make my own choices.
6154315 6156181 If it was a mistake,
6156359 6158316 you have my deepest apologies.
6160488 6161774 Why are you here now?
6161947 6164359 Neo's escape<br />has destabilized the Matrix.
6164533 6167025 The Anomaleum draws its current<br />from Trinity alone now.
6167328 6171287 A fail-safe has been triggered to reset<br />the Matrix back to the previous version.
6171624 6173331 But The Analyst halted the reset.
6173501 6176710 He's convinced the authorities<br />that you will soon return voluntarily.
6177963 6179328 And why would he say that?
6180091 6182924 Because if I don't go back,<br />he'll kill Trinity.
6185846 6188133 Faced with returning to your pod
6188307 6190344 or enduring Trinity's death again.
6191102 6192308 What would you choose, Neo?
6193437 6194677 I'll go back.
6196565 6198727 Well, The Analyst knows you well,
6198901 6201393 but that knowledge<br />has made him incautious.
6201570 6202605 After you escaped,
6202697 6205655 he should have accepted his losses<br />and devacuated Trinity.
6206492 6209075 But that would have prevented<br />this extraordinary opportunity
6209245 6211077 that now exists before us.
6211789 6213621 A few hours ago,
6214959 6218202 no one would have been able<br />to convince me
6218379 6222418 that I would be standing here,<br />trying to explain a mission
6222591 6224457 as crazy as this one.
6228347 6229883 What are you doing?
6230057 6231639 - Volunteering.<br />- Oh, no.
6231809 6236053 You are the one captain<br />that I am ordering to go.
6236397 6239560 Now you don't have to order me,<br />General, 'cause I'm volunteering.
6242987 6244477 I need two more.
6249076 6251363 Are you out of your minds?
6252037 6253778 You don't even know what it is.
6253956 6256288 General, we know you.
6256959 6260202 If you say this is important,<br />none of us is choosing to stay home.
6265634 6266669 Thank you.
6271849 6273760 Knuckle up and good luck.
6285446 6287437 [dramatic music playing]
6288073 6289313 [Kujaku chittering]
6303964 6307298 [Sati] Trinity is held in the Anomaleum,<br />which is in this transmission tower.
6307468 6309630 <i>The passages used to rescue Neo<br />are now sealed</i>
6309804 6311795 <i>and a legion of Sentinels<br />patrols the tower.</i>
6311972 6313929 So stealth will be paramount.
6314099 6315840 As long as we raise no alarms,
6316018 6318079 this first part of the mission<br />should be the easiest.
6318103 6321095 You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,<br />sneaking across an entire power plant,
6321273 6324516 climbing a two-kilometer tower<br />guarded by thousands of Sentinels?
6324652 6325687 That's the easy part?
6325861 6327101 Exactly so.
6327780 6329987 Because all we have to do<br />is convince someone
6330074 6331656 who does this every day
6331826 6333112 to take one of us along.
6333202 6335322 - [electricity crackling]<br />- [dramatic music continues]
6356809 6360222 Fifty meters below the Anomaleum<br />is a stratum of amniotic filters.
6360396 6363388 Hidden along this edge<br />is a small hexagonal vent.
6363899 6366982 <i>This vent feeds the air intake<br />into the corpuscular modifier,</i>
6367152 6370019 <i>which oxygenates<br />the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.</i>
6370698 6371698 I get it.
6371866 6374858 The exomorph<br />slinkies up Neo's old umbilicus.
6376203 6377318 What could go wrong?
6377413 6379700 [tense music playing]
6390342 6391423 [grunts]
6406984 6408190 [straining]
6424209 6426746 [Sati] <i>Once inside,<br />Morpheus will use the System Operator</i>
6426921 6429663 <i>to open the devacuator line<br />and disengage the macerators.</i>
6429965 6431330 [machinery clanking]
6434094 6435630 In order to unplug Trinity's body,
6435804 6437886 while her mind<br />still remains connected to the Matrix,
6438057 6440765 I'm gonna need a second human brain<br />to implement the bypass.
6440935 6442642 And since Neo must be with The Analyst,
6442811 6446896 the only available mind<br />that's a near-enough match is yours.
6448442 6449442 Figures.
6449526 6451016 [tense music playing]
6466919 6468000 Thanks, Cybebe.
6469046 6470046 [grunts]
6476428 6478294 Does Trinity still have to<br />take the red pill?
6478472 6481152 Since Kujaku and I are transferring<br />her consciousness onto the ship,
6481308 6482924 it's not strictly necessary.
6483102 6485810 But what matters<br />is that this is her choice.
6487147 6489388 Extracting a confused<br />or an uncertain mind
6489483 6491724 will, in all probability, kill her.
6491902 6494485 But even if it is what she wants,
6494655 6497989 won't The Analyst<br />just order the Sentinels to stop you?
6498158 6499239 He will.
6499910 6501821 But if my plan works, it won't matter.
6502287 6503287 Why?
6503455 6504945 Because we'll already be gone.
6506875 6510084 Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,<br />there has to be a reason why.
6512381 6515544 When my father realized<br />how the Anomaleum was going to be used,
6516135 6518877 he covertly transferred<br />the designs to me.
6519638 6521970 The Analyst discovered his betrayal,
6522141 6523927 and had my parents purged.
6525144 6526600 [inhales sharply]
6526687 6529554 I would have been murdered too<br />if it wasn't for Kujaku.
6532776 6535359 Not a day goes by<br />that I don't grieve them.
6536947 6539655 I've been praying for this day<br />for a very long time.
6543412 6544527 [door unlocks, opens]
6548042 6549453 We're coming up on broadcast.
6552254 6556043 I thought you should know<br />that I'm here because of her.
6559803 6561919 All I ever wanted<br />was to be as fearless as Trinity.
6564349 6567387 But I saw how she reacted in the garage,<br />and I...
6567770 6569977 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6570439 6571895 What if we're too late?
6573817 6575399 What if she's not Trinity anymore?
6577279 6578485 [sighs]
6580949 6583566 I never believed I was The One.
6584495 6585860 But she did.
6586955 6588537 She believed in me.
6591335 6593417 It's my turn to believe in her.
6594546 6595546 [sighs]
6597883 6599794 [suspenseful music playing]
6618570 6620311 [Sati] This is where it gets tricky.
6631667 6633874 Have you ever done<br />an operation like this?
6634586 6635667 Not yet.
6639383 6641249 [suspenseful music builds]
6657442 6658773 Here we go.
6658902 6660734 [suspenseful music continues]
6676420 6678036 Welcome home.
6678505 6680712 All I want is to talk to her.
6680883 6682214 Do you mean Tiff?
6682384 6685297 Come back, and you can talk to her<br />as often as you like.
6685470 6688428 I mean, handsome Chad<br />may have something to say about it.
6688599 6691682 If she tells me this is what she wants,
6692895 6693976 you win.
6694146 6695227 Really?
6695397 6697354 But if she wants me,
6698275 6700141 then you'll let us go free.
6700319 6703061 And why would I do something<br />as stupid as that?
6703238 6705821 Right now, I'm on a ship full of people<br />who will unplug me
6705991 6708278 before they'll let you take me back.
6708994 6710576 If you want this Matrix,
6711121 6712703 this is your only chance.
6712873 6715410 But how do I know<br />they won't unplug you anyway?
6715918 6719036 Same way I know<br />you'll let us walk out of here.
6720422 6722629 [suspenseful music playing]
6744655 6745816 Okay.
6746448 6747904 I like tests.
6748867 6750403 We'll let Tiff decide.
6750744 6752405 [electricity crackling]
6764424 6765755 [Sati breathing heavily]
6767970 6769085 That's it.
6770347 6771508 Bypass is ready.
6771932 6773263 Now what?
6773725 6774760 We wait.
6775143 6777054 Doesn't it seem crazy<br />to come all this way
6777145 6778510 and leave her here?
6778897 6780888 We must abide by her decision.
6781608 6783098 And if she says no,
6783986 6785351 what happens to Neo?
6785529 6789614 At this time,<br />the most important choice of Neo's life
6789783 6791194 is not his to make.
6798333 6800449 [slow suspenseful music playing]
6822316 6824023 I saw this in my dream.
6825652 6828940 If I was the Oracle,<br />maybe I could explain it.
6829614 6831150 The Oracle.
6831325 6832941 From your game?
6834870 6837077 It's not a game.
6839207 6840413 Oh, God.
6845255 6846586 [Tiffany sighs]
6848008 6851251 After you left, I went home
6851428 6853089 and I played it.
6855515 6856880 I kept thinking,
6858226 6861344 "Why does this story<br />feel like a memory?"
6868612 6870273 There's a part of me
6873158 6876071 that feels like I have been<br />waiting my whole life for you.
6879122 6881409 And that part is like,
6881583 6884245 "What the hell<br />took you so long?" [sniffles]
6885253 6887210 I don't have an easy answer.
6889466 6891548 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6893095 6894881 Afraid of what might happen.
6896598 6899386 Afraid of hurting<br />the only person I ever loved.
6901269 6904637 I wish I was who you think I am.
6906066 6907602 But look at me.
6908985 6910521 I can't be her.
6911321 6913278 - [Donnie] Mom!<br />- [Brandon] Mom! Come on.
6913448 6914563 - Mom!<br />- It's Callie.
6914741 6915741 Is this real?
6915909 6916969 [Donnie] You have to come with us.
6916993 6918137 [Brandon] Come on, we gotta go.
6918161 6919242 Tiff, hey.
6919329 6921349 Don't know what's going on here,<br />but I'm glad we found you.
6921373 6922934 - She got hit by a car.<br />- I know, it's crazy.
6922958 6924073 She was chasing after you.
6924251 6925436 They're casting her arm. We gotta go.
6925460 6926729 [Chad] Doctor said she's gonna be fine.
6926753 6928713 [Donnie] You have to come with us<br />to the hospital.
6928880 6929880 It's too late.
6930048 6931083 I understand.
6931258 6933124 - Tiff, come on, let's go.<br />- [Donnie] Come on.
6939683 6940718 What's happening?
6942853 6944014 Neo was wrong.
6944104 6946311 [somber music playing]
6977304 6978385 Tiffany.
6982100 6984512 Tiffany, you have to come with us.
6986229 6987515 Tiffany! [echoing]
6989983 6993476 I wish you would<br />fucking stop calling me that.
6993653 6995143 I hate that name.
6996698 6998280 My name is Trinity
6998450 7000657 and you better<br />take your hands off of me.
7001786 7003447 [Trinity grunting]
7011838 7012838 Neo!
7013340 7014340 Trinity!
7015550 7016550 Oh, shit.
7017928 7019134 Get her out. Get her out!
7019304 7021261 [grunts, yells]
7027896 7030354 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7031399 7033936 I own that mistake.<br />Shouldn't have pressed.
7034110 7036067 Women used to be so easy to control.
7037280 7041569 You know there's no way<br />I can let you two go free.
7045038 7046449 Cannot happen.
7049793 7052455 So, I guess it's déjà vu all over again.
7053588 7054749 She dies,
7055549 7056835 and it's all your fault.
7058426 7060963 Lies, lies and more lies.
7061721 7062927 Smith?
7063098 7065576 What has the world come to<br />when you can't even trust a program?
7065600 7067967 - How...<br />- [gun clatters]
7069104 7071391 Tom and I have more in common<br />than you know.
7071856 7074769 Once he got out, let's just say,
7075694 7077401 I was free to be me.
7078154 7079519 [grunts]
7085161 7087323 - Yeah!<br />- Trinity?
7087998 7090035 [tense music playing]
7104306 7105592 [bell tinkling]
7113481 7115347 [all grunting]
7119404 7120735 [Trinity groaning]
7123450 7124986 [breathes shakily]
7136254 7137289 You ready?
7137464 7138750 Yeah.
7142093 7143504 [Bugs groans, yells]
7150185 7151266 [bell tinkling]
7152687 7153687 [cat yowls]
7153772 7155308 [grunting]
7160779 7162269 [distorted screaming]
7165200 7167737 [yells]
7170538 7172700 - [Sati grunts]<br />- [screaming]
7175168 7176203 [screaming]
7180882 7182293 Oh, no.
7183760 7186047 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7206282 7209570 [Neo and Trinity straining]
7209911 7211197 Stop them.
7211496 7214534 [both yelling]
7223383 7225124 [explosion]
7237105 7238516 You think this is over?
7238690 7240601 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7249743 7251905 Here, our unexpected alliance ends.
7253747 7255579 You know the difference between us, Tom?
7256416 7257827 Anyone could have been you.
7258376 7260287 Whereas I've always been anyone.
7262714 7264455 [grunting]
7265759 7266840 What just happened?
7267302 7268417 What?
7270555 7272842 - [alarm blaring]<br />- Oh, no! Move! Move!
7273183 7274223 Get the hell out of there.
7274309 7276346 [tense music playing]
7278146 7279978 - How bad?<br />- Like, all the bad.
7281357 7282722 Yeah, this is bad.
7284277 7285733 I don't suppose you can still fly?
7292827 7294784 [grunting]
7296247 7297829 Yeah, that's not happening.
7300126 7301662 [ominous music playing]
7321856 7323472 [all screaming]
7323608 7324848 Neo! Get on.
7324943 7326479 [engine revving]
7333618 7335359 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7335537 7337403 Everyone else, we stay with them!
7354639 7357006 - How is she?<br />- Life signs are good.
7360979 7362310 Her signal's strong, Captain.
7364899 7365899 [Kujaku squawks]
7371239 7373230 Well done, Captain.
7375702 7377409 Now all we need is a miracle.
7377829 7379820 [tense music playing]
7383668 7384703 [siren wailing]
7391718 7392833 [Neo grunts]
7396264 7397504 [tires screech]
7405607 7406607 I hate bots.
7413072 7414858 - Get us out of here!<br />- I'm trying!
7415033 7416833 The lockdown is tracking.<br />Swarm is everywhere.
7416993 7418193 Never seen anything like this.
7428046 7429161 [grunts]
7431799 7433164 [siren wailing]
7435011 7436718 [tense music playing]
7438306 7439762 [engine revving]
7463998 7466114 Seq, what is that?
7471172 7472253 What's wrong?
7474050 7475461 What are you... [screams]
7479806 7480806 [grunts]
7483142 7485053 He's turning bots into bombs.
7487313 7488803 [glass shattering]
7491150 7492936 [bodies thudding]
7500118 7501654 [tires screeching]
7511713 7513078 [tires screeching]
7517552 7518633 Shit! [grunts]
7518803 7519803 Lexy?
7519887 7521628 [gunfire]
7528479 7530119 - [tires screeching]<br />- [tram bell ringing]
7534277 7535438 Sheperd's in trouble.
7535528 7536859 [Lexy grunting]
7538531 7539692 Jack me in.
7540616 7542656 I can get you in.<br />I don't know if I can get you out.
7548499 7550081 - No!<br />- [tires screeching]
7557091 7558707 [motorcycle revving]
7563514 7564549 What are they doing?
7568728 7570264 Herding them into a kill zone.
7596339 7597545 [both groaning]
7601385 7602500 [Neo groaning]
7603429 7604794 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7604889 7607051 - [Lexy groaning]<br />- Hang on, Lex.
7607141 7608427 [Lexy screaming]
7611312 7613053 - Lexy!<br />- [grunting]
7620947 7623029 [tense music playing]
7655398 7656598 [SWAT officer] There they are!
7669871 7671202 [Neo straining]
7679338 7680794 [all grunting]
7682925 7684086 Morpheus!
7687972 7688972 Lex.
7689849 7691635 - Bugsy.<br />- Hell yeah!
7692643 7694225 Seq, where's Neo?
7694395 7695931 It's bad. They're pinned.
7696105 7697105 Heading to a roof.
7709493 7710904 [dramatic music playing]
7717627 7718913 [Neo grunting]
7744528 7746895 [Neo yelling, grunts loudly]
7758584 7759870 [both grunting]
7762129 7763915 [machine beeping rapidly]
7766509 7769126 Nodal fibrillation is critical.<br />She'll die if we don't extract.
7789490 7792573 [soft dramatic music playing]
7796038 7797824 [inhales deeply]
7800167 7801703 [exhales]
7810177 7812760 It's so beautiful.
7828112 7829773 I remember this.
7831907 7834069 I remember us.
7852219 7854176 My dream ended here.
7865107 7866643 We can't go back.
7868778 7869859 We won't.
7885127 7886743 [evocative music playing]
7889215 7890501 Can they make the jump?
7895429 7896635 [music stops]
7904397 7906183 [slow evocative music playing]
7914240 7916982 [grunting]
7921664 7922825 I'm not doing this.
7923374 7924660 Are you doing this?
7926919 7928375 [dramatic music playing]
7939515 7941472 [helicopter hovering]
7948774 7949855 Bye.
7984810 7986346 [soft music playing]
8013172 8014754 - [bell tinkling]<br />- [meows]
8015799 8017039 [crumbling in distance]
8020471 8022087 [suspenseful music playing]
8030940 8032476 How dramatic.
8033317 8034398 "Tiffany"?
8034818 8037651 [chuckles] It was a private joke.
8037821 8039277 An amusement, that's all.
8039448 8041530 An amusement? Hmm.
8041825 8042860 [flesh tears]
8043577 8045568 - [softly] Whoa.<br />- [groaning]
8045746 8047111 Kind of like that?
8047206 8048241 [chokes]
8049959 8051290 [gulps]
8051377 8053789 Okay. Ow.
8054338 8056420 If you hated the name so much,<br />why did you heel
8056549 8058039 like a good little bitch so long?
8058133 8059486 - [Trinity grunts]<br />- [blade slices]
8059510 8060591 [body thuds]
8061220 8063302 Yeah. Definitely asked for that.
8065266 8067473 - [snaps fingers]<br />- [The Analyst groaning]
8068769 8070555 [shudders] Can't you control her?
8073566 8074931 [groaning]
8076485 8078101 That was for using children.
8083075 8084565 We have a few questions.
8084743 8087906 - You tried to activate the fail-safe.<br />- The Suits tried.
8088080 8090242 Obviously, without control<br />of your source code,
8090416 8091747 I knew that was impossible.
8091917 8093954 So, why haven't the Suits purged you?
8094920 8096786 Because I know the system.
8097631 8099372 I know human beings.
8100134 8101624 And I know you.
8102428 8103964 [bones crack, sighs]
8104930 8107297 Right now, you're feeling good<br />about what you've done.
8107474 8109715 You should. It was a victory. Bravo.
8110561 8111892 Now what?
8112062 8114679 You've come here<br />to negotiate some kind of deal?
8114857 8116268 You think you hold all the cards
8116442 8118729 because you can do<br />whatever you want in this world.
8118902 8121234 I say, go for it.
8121405 8123897 Remake it. Knock yourselves out.
8124074 8125985 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8126160 8127275 But here's the thing.
8127453 8130320 The sheeple aren't going anywhere.
8130497 8131737 They like my world.
8131915 8134748 They don't want this sentimentality.
8134918 8136659 They don't want freedom or empowerment.
8136837 8139204 They want to be controlled.
8139381 8141338 They crave the comfort of certainty.
8141508 8144170 And that means you two,<br />back in your pods,
8144345 8147679 unconscious and alone, just like them.
8149642 8151258 [both chuckle]
8152102 8154719 We're not here to negotiate anything.
8154897 8156979 We were on our way to remake your world.
8157149 8158560 Change a few things.
8158734 8161101 I kind of like the<br />"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.
8161195 8163357 Just remind people<br />what a free mind can do.
8163530 8164986 I forgot. It's easy to forget.
8165157 8167489 - He makes it easy.<br />- That, he does.
8167660 8169697 Something he should think about.
8170788 8174326 Before we got started,<br />we decided to stop by to say thank you.
8175167 8177955 You gave us something<br />we never thought we could have.
8178128 8179459 And what is that?
8180381 8181963 Another chance.
8182299 8184131 [punk rock music playing]
8845545 8848128 Face reality, people. Movies are dead.
8848298 8850130 Games are dead.
8850300 8852086 Narrative? Dead.
8852260 8854126 Media is nothing<br />but neuro-trigger response
8854220 8855220 and viral conditioning.
8855388 8856924 Wait, what are you two talking about?
8859225 8860386 Cat videos.
8861269 8864853 What we need is a series of videos
8865023 8867264 that we call "The Catrix."
