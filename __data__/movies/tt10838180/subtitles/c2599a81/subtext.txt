58065 59775 - Seq, I'm in.<br />- Captain.
59858 61110 You were right.
61193 62611 The skylight<br />was a window pane.
62695 64196 I've got<br />serious interference.
64280 65614 Weird.<br />It's some kind of Modal.
65698 67491 Looks like old code.
67575 68951 It feels really familiar.
69034 70786 Drop a pin.<br />I'll signal for backup.
70869 72538 - I'm gonna check it out.<br />- Bugs?
72621 73831 If the general finds out<br />we've been fishing...
73914 75583 A quick peek can't hurt.
75666 76959 Did you hear that?
77042 78419 Shit. I think<br />our signal was traced.
78502 80629 Bugs, this feels like a trap.
80713 81839 Bugs!
121795 124298 Freeze!<br />Do not move!
124381 125341 We will shoot!
125424 128719 Very slowly, raise your hands.
142608 144193 Here we go.
150032 151533 Hey, where are you going?
151617 152826 You were warned, Lieutenant.
152910 155162 I think we can handle<br />one little girl.
158582 159708 You're wasting your time!
159792 162044 My men are bringing her<br />down now.
162127 163212 No, Lieutenant,
164296 166298 your men are already dead.
176850 178102 Seq, you with me?
178185 179561 This old code keeps crashing.
179645 180979 Your projection's breaking up.<br />Switch to audio.
181063 182398 Bugs,<br />this is a direct violation
182481 183732 of the general's protocols.
183816 185234 I know, I know.
185317 186944 But something<br />is happening here.
187820 189571 Something important.
189655 190739 Oh, fuck.
190823 192408 We know what happens next.
192491 194159 She kicks their ass.
216682 218100 Now she makes a call.
218183 219435 The line was traced.
219518 221770 - And then...<br />- Then she runs for her life.
221854 223188 Are there any agents?
223272 224690 We know this story.
226233 227860 This is how it all began.
228569 230404 God damn it.
230487 231947 This is where he began.
232030 235284 You're thinking this Modal<br />is a loop? Or a treadmill?
235367 238912 Some sort of sequencer<br />evolving a program to do what?
238996 240164 I don't know.
241331 242958 But I'm going to find out.
243041 244168 All right.
274782 277159 So deja vu and yet it's<br />obviously all wrong.
277242 279411 Why use old code<br />to mirror something new?
279495 281121 I don't know.
294510 295844 If that's supposed<br />to be Trinity,
295928 297471 that's not what happens.
299431 301391 Maybe this isn't the story<br />we think it is.
301475 303852 Bugs, you have<br />to get out of here.
303936 306188 It's gotta be a trap.
307606 308649 Shit.
347771 349565 You all carry on.
349648 350649 As you were.
353652 355195 I'm just gonna...
356113 357865 see myself out.
357948 358949 Kill her.
393108 394902 Oh, Seq!
462594 464012 - Why did you save me?<br />- You first.
464096 465847 Who are you?<br />Where did you come from?
465931 467474 Okay.
467557 469309 My name is Bugs.
469393 471687 As in Bunny.
471770 473480 And tech that listens.
474564 476525 Do you know this is a Modal?
477776 478902 What's a Modal?
478986 481279 It's a simulation<br />used to evolve programs.
485075 487035 Do you understand<br />that you are...
487953 489621 digital sentience?
489705 491373 I know what I am.
491456 492708 Just like I know my job
492791 494876 is to hunt down<br />and destroy synthients.
494960 496211 Like you.
500382 501925 And yet...
503677 505012 Here we are.
505095 506513 Here we are.
507973 510267 The other agents<br />don't know about this room?
512227 513395 How'd you find it?
513478 515981 No one was ever<br />in the key shop,
516064 517274 so I started looking.
518442 520527 More you looked,<br />the more you found.
521570 523155 Story of my life.
530287 531288 What?
533457 535042 I feel like I know this room.
543675 546094 Holy shit.
548472 549931 This is his apartment.
551183 553268 You mean Thomas Anderson's?
553351 555312 I searched everywhere.<br />He doesn't exist.
555395 557647 He stopped being Thomas<br />a long time ago,
557731 560108 but maybe you know him<br />by his real name.
560859 561943 Neo.
563403 564654 You do.
565739 567324 Oh, okay.
569367 571995 I can't believe this,<br />after all these years.
572079 575749 You see, most people<br />think that Neo is dead.
577084 578502 But I know he's not.
579461 581213 Because I've seen him.
583465 585258 Where?
585342 587886 It's not something<br />I can explain easily, but...
592391 595519 But the moment<br />he looked at me,
595602 597229 I felt something...
600565 602275 unlock my mind.
604820 605904 Okay.
608198 610158 Something like that<br />happened to me.
615080 616748 I saw this pattern...
618041 619459 and it was everywhere.
621086 623463 We can't see it,<br />but we're all trapped inside
623547 626091 these strange,<br />repeating loops.
626174 629427 Somehow I saw it<br />in the mirror.
629511 632264 Just a flicker,<br />but it was like you said.
637769 640147 And suddenly I understood.
640230 642691 This is not the real world.
645152 648488 For the first time,<br />I felt real purpose.
649156 651116 I knew who I was
651199 653118 and what I had to do.
653785 655203 Who are you?
656538 658248 What do you have to do?
661209 662502 I am...
663295 664671 Morpheus.
665797 668091 And I have to find Neo.
672262 673597 Morpheus.
676558 678185 Okay. Okay.
678268 679352 Oh, my God!
679436 680729 I have to get you out of here.
680812 683231 I need to figure out<br />who built this Modal.
683315 684900 Okay, come with me.
684983 687110 You have to be ready to leave.<br />You have to be really ready.
687194 688486 And if you're not,
688570 689571 if you think that<br />this is where you belong...
693074 694492 You call this a choice?
694576 696077 Oh, honestly, when somebody<br />offered me these things,
696161 697662 I went off on binary<br />conceptions of the world
697746 699331 and said there was no way<br />I was swallowing
699414 701291 some symbolic reduction<br />of my life.
701374 702709 And the woman<br />with the pills laughed
702792 703960 'cause I was<br />missing the point.
704044 705587 What point?
705670 708590 The choice is an illusion.
708673 710884 You already know<br />what you have to do.
717641 718725 Truth.
725440 726441 Okay.
726524 727734 There's an old building
727817 729402 with a skylight<br />and lots of stairs.
729486 730695 The Lafayette.
730779 732322 One of the four back doors<br />leads there.
734366 735867 - Don't fight it.<br />- Whoa, what's happening?
735951 737035 Keep breathing.
737118 738495 Extraction works<br />pretty much the same
738578 740497 for humans and programs.
746878 748171 Okay.
750715 752133 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
752217 754010 I've never worn<br />different glasses before.
754094 756846 Yeah, looks good.<br />Which door?
756930 758723 - It's gotta be...<br />- Okay.
763770 765480 Agent White.
765563 766773 Agent Smith?
772487 773947 Go!
781162 782831 Seq! Can you hear me?
782914 784165 Bugs! I thought I lost you.
784249 785500 Can you get us<br />to the window pane?
785583 787544 Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!
797721 799973 That window! Go hard!
846186 848646 What the...
854944 856905 What the hell?
873755 875090 Something wrong?
875173 877926 Just a little crash.
878009 880387 Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
880470 884265 What a beautiful day<br />to be alive. Am I right?
884349 886351 - Problemo?<br />- He lost something.
887685 888978 Is this old Matrix code?
890980 892565 A little Modal experiment.
892649 895610 For Binary?
895693 898321 - I need a coffee.<br />- Coffee. Yes, stat!
898405 899531 I'm buying.
902534 904285 I'm not trying to blow<br />smoke up your ass,
904369 908790 but the first time I played<br />the trilogy, I was shook.
908873 911459 The paradox<br />between free will and destiny.
911543 912710 Are we all just algorithms
912794 914003 doing what we're<br />supposed to do
914087 915797 or can we escape<br />our programming?
915880 919801 Genius, inside the context<br />of the game, BT dubs.
919884 921970 Hey, did I tell you<br />it took over my life?
922053 924806 Yeah. I failed<br />the seventh grade.
924889 927058 Your game almost ruined me.
927142 929644 - So you've said.<br />- Yet here we are.
929727 932564 You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
932647 933690 is it free will
934941 936568 or destiny?
941239 943158 Oh, yeah.
943241 945160 There she is.
945243 946744 Total f-ing MILF.
947620 949706 Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
949789 952083 I'm a geek.<br />I was raised by machines.
952167 953418 Maybe you should go.
953501 956546 No, please.<br />I promise, best self.
956629 957881 Best self.
961801 963052 Sure.
963928 965346 You ever talk to her?
967474 968892 Tell you what.
968975 973354 For all you've done for me,<br />let me do this for you.
973438 976191 Jude, no. Stop.
976274 977984 - Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Thanks.
978067 979486 Hi...
979569 981154 I know this is all<br />a bit extemporaneous.
981237 982864 I'm Jude Gallagher.
982947 985533 I work for a game company<br />called Deus Machina.
985617 986868 Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
986951 989871 Tiffany.<br />Didn't see that coming.
989954 991873 - Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.<br />- Jude.
991956 995877 Oh, and this is my very<br />good friend, Thomas Anderson.
995960 997879 He is a bona fide<br />famous person
997962 999339 and considered by most to be
999422 1001424 the greatest game designer<br />of our generation.
1001508 1002717 I'm sorry about this.
1002800 1004010 - Jude...<br />- Just talk to her.
1004093 1006596 Hi, Thomas.<br />Everyone calls me Tiff.
1007472 1008681 Hi.
1015855 1016981 Have we met?
1018441 1020568 We both come here.
1020652 1022070 - Can I have your morning bun?<br />- Hey!
1022153 1023571 Are you trying<br />to ball my mom or what?
1023655 1024948 Brandon!
1025031 1026908 Can I have one bite?
1026991 1029994 Babe! What's going on?<br />We're gonna be late.
1030078 1031996 This is my husband, Chad.
1032080 1033873 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hey.
1035500 1037585 Babe, we gotta get<br />Callie to practice.
1037669 1039754 Right. Sorry.
1039838 1041464 Come on, kids. Let's move out.
1065822 1066823 What?
1074289 1076624 Sorry. It's the boss.
1082547 1085633 Billions of people<br />just living out their lives...
1086843 1088678 oblivious.
1090638 1093016 I always loved that line.
1093099 1094559 You wrote that one, yeah?
1097270 1099439 Every time I stand here,
1099522 1102775 I mean, O-M-G.
1102859 1104902 It's so perfect,<br />it's gotta be fake.
1105945 1107363 Right?
1109240 1110491 Yeah.
1111242 1112493 Sure.
1112577 1114412 Have a seat.
1117415 1118625 Smoke?
1119917 1120960 I thought you quit.
1121836 1124213 I quit calling it a habit.
1124297 1126215 Now it's just<br />a guilty pleasure.
1128384 1131971 Maybe I can make this<br />easy for you.
1132055 1134098 I know Binary is over budget.
1134182 1136476 This is not about Binary, Tom.<br />It's bigger than that.
1136559 1137894 This is about our future,
1137977 1140938 which is a sticky subject,<br />given our past.
1141022 1142231 What do you mean?
1143358 1144943 How's the therapy?
1145026 1146319 Good.
1147028 1148488 Any...
1149447 1150782 episodes?
1152575 1153660 No.
1154285 1156079 That's terrific.
1157789 1161292 Look, Tom, I know we've<br />always had our differences.
1161376 1163211 What did you say<br />about our first meeting?
1163294 1166547 We had all the chemistry<br />of an FBI interrogation.
1169258 1170677 But look at this place.
1171761 1173096 We did this.
1174472 1175682 Together.
1177058 1178518 Yeah.
1178601 1180561 Now what?
1180645 1184232 Things have changed.<br />The market's tough.
1184315 1186609 I'm sure you can understand<br />why our beloved
1186693 1188069 parent company, Warner Bros.,
1188152 1190571 has decided to make<br />a sequel to the trilogy.
1190655 1192073 What?
1192156 1194075 They informed me they're gonna<br />do it with or without us.
1194158 1195993 I thought<br />they couldn't do that.
1197203 1198579 Oh, they can.
1198663 1199997 And they made it clear
1200081 1202250 they'll kill our contract<br />if we don't cooperate.
1202333 1204043 Really?
1204127 1208005 I know you said the story<br />was over for you,
1208089 1210258 but that's the thing<br />about stories.
1212051 1213970 They never really end,<br />do they?
1214053 1216597 We're still telling the same<br />stories we've always told,
1216681 1220977 just with different names,<br />different faces
1222603 1225690 and I have to say<br />I'm kind of excited.
1228526 1229694 After all these years,
1229777 1232780 to be going back<br />to where it all started.
1232864 1235199 Back to The Matrix.
1236325 1238035 I've spoken to Marketing...
1244000 1245543 Tom?
1245626 1247170 Yeah.
1247253 1248296 Are you all right?
1250631 1251758 Yeah.
1256679 1258890 What were you feeling<br />at that point?
1261976 1263770 What was I feeling?
1267064 1271819 I felt either I'm having<br />a mental breakdown again
1271903 1276157 or I'm living inside<br />a computer-generated reality
1276240 1277784 that has imprisoned me...
1278409 1279577 again.
1290254 1291756 Not much of a choice.
1291839 1293049 No.
1293132 1294717 Maybe it's not<br />as binary as that.
1294801 1298095 Maybe there are other ways<br />to understand what happened.
1298679 1299764 Yeah.
1299847 1302016 Thomas, you are<br />a suicide survivor
1302099 1304977 gifted with<br />a powerful imagination.
1305061 1306813 Those facts have combined
1306896 1309398 to create dangerous fictions<br />in your life.
1309482 1311025 Yesterday,<br />you walked into a meeting
1311108 1312235 with your business partner
1312318 1313778 and he ambushed you,
1313861 1316280 demanding you make a game<br />you said you would never make.
1316364 1319700 This attack effectively<br />took away your voice.
1319784 1322537 His violence triggered you<br />and your mind fought back.
1322620 1324497 You did to him<br />what he was doing to you.
1325998 1327375 We've talked about the value
1327458 1331003 of adaptive anger<br />in healing trauma.
1331087 1334465 Far from suggesting a repeat<br />of your initial breakdown,
1334549 1335758 I believe this episode
1335842 1337635 demonstrates healthy<br />self-protection.
1339178 1341389 And more importantly,<br />I remember how hard
1341472 1344517 it was for you<br />to share something like this.
1344600 1347311 Which tells me<br />just how far we've come.
1352400 1354694 Do you need a refill<br />on your prescription?
1356571 1357738 Yeah.
1380344 1382555 First of all, I know<br />I speak for everyone
1382638 1384932 when I say that<br />I'm so, so excited
1385016 1387101 to be working on a game<br />that was such a...
1387184 1389270 well, game changer.
1389353 1390938 Now, the packet<br />in front of you
1391022 1393816 has our focus group research.
1393900 1395359 Inside, you'll find<br />the breakdown
1395443 1398279 including keyword association<br />with the brand.
1398362 1401449 The top two being<br />originality and fresh,
1401532 1403576 which I think are great things<br />to keep in mind
1403659 1405870 as you begin<br />working on Matrix 4.
1407413 1408998 And who knows how many more?
1424513 1427934 What made Matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1428017 1429310 On point.
1429393 1431395 People want us<br />up in their grey space,
1431479 1434523 switching their synaptic<br />WTF light on.
1443658 1446994 What made Matrix different?<br />It effed with your head.
1447078 1448913 People want us<br />up in their grey space,
1448996 1450331 switching their synaptic
1450414 1453042 what the hell is going on here<br />light on.
1463135 1467348 I didn't love the first one,<br />like some of you.
1467431 1469850 And, frankly,<br />I've got zero tolerance
1469934 1472353 for anything that requires<br />a syllabus and a highlighter.
1472436 1474313 I like my games big,<br />loud and dumb.
1474397 1476357 We need guns! Lots of guns.
1476440 1479026 Matrix means mayhem.
1483698 1485866 Mindless action<br />is not on-brand.
1485950 1487368 She's right.
1487451 1490496 Matrix is mind-porn.<br />Philosophy in shiny...
1490579 1492248 - tight PVC.<br />- Yeah.
1492331 1494208 Ideas are the new sexy.
1508347 1510057 Obviously<br />The Matrix is about...
1510141 1512393 - Trans-politics.<br />- Crypto-fascism.
1512476 1513394 It's a metaphor...
1513477 1515146 of capitalist exploitation.
1527616 1531996 This cannot be another reboot,<br />retread, regurgitated...
1532079 1534165 Why not? Reboots sell.
1537293 1539295 We are so far down the wrong<br />rabbit hole, here, people.
1539378 1543215 You say Matrix to anyone...<br />You say Matrix...
1543299 1546260 Matrix...<br />Matrix... Matrix...
1546343 1548179 This is what they see.
1554852 1557146 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
1557229 1559398 Bullet time! Bullet time!
1560066 1561108 That's two words.
1565112 1568282 We need<br />a new bullet time.
1570868 1574789 We need to revolutionize<br />gaming again.
1574872 1578667 Revolutionize gaming<br />again!
1604568 1606320 Afternoon, Tiff.
1606403 1607571 The ushe?
1607655 1609824 You know what, Skroce?<br />I'm going wild.
1609907 1612409 I'll have a cortado today.
1612493 1615037 Fly that freak flag.
1615121 1616872 Mind if I get that?
1616956 1617998 Oh, hi.
1618999 1621001 Hi.
1621085 1623587 I remember<br />wanting a family,
1623671 1624964 but was that because
1625047 1627716 that's what women<br />are supposed to want?
1627800 1629510 How do you know<br />if you want something yourself
1629593 1632721 or if your upbringing<br />programmed you to want it?
1634849 1636809 I pay my analyst<br />a lot of money
1636892 1639478 to answer<br />such questions for me.
1639562 1640771 Smart.
1640855 1642064 I should get more therapy
1642148 1644567 but honestly,<br />I'm too goddamn tired.
1644650 1646402 Kids are exhausting, you know?
1647987 1650239 No. Never had kids.
1650322 1653075 Oh, right, I knew that.
1653159 1655619 Sorry. I googled you.
1657580 1660166 So, what's it like being<br />a world-famous game designer?
1660249 1662793 Must be amazing.
1662877 1664378 A lot of hours.
1664461 1666505 Sometimes it is amazing.
1666589 1668090 Most times...
1669300 1670593 I don't know.
1670676 1673179 But you made The Matrix.<br />Even I've heard of that.
1673262 1677057 Yeah. We kept<br />some kids entertained.
1677141 1679268 So, worth it?
1685608 1688194 Can I ask something<br />about your game?
1688277 1689528 Sure.
1689612 1691864 Did you base your<br />main character on yourself?
1696994 1698996 There is a lot of me in him.
1701498 1704668 Maybe a little too much.
1706670 1708422 Can I ask you something else?
1708505 1709715 Please.
1711425 1713719 There's a woman in your game.
1714929 1715930 Trinity.
1717765 1720517 Which is a weird<br />coincidence also, right?
1722061 1723187 God, yeah.
1724563 1725814 I like her.
1727024 1729318 I like Trinity.
1729401 1730653 And I dig her Ducati.
1730736 1733739 Another coincidence.<br />I love motorcycles.
1737034 1739745 My friend Kush and I<br />actually build them.
1739828 1740955 Really?
1741038 1744416 You have your analyst,<br />I have my bikes.
1744500 1749129 So, I was looking at images<br />from your game. At Trinity.
1750839 1752424 Well, I showed Chad a scene,
1752508 1754551 and I was like,<br />so, what do you think?
1755636 1758138 He didn't get it until I said,
1758222 1760224 don't you think<br />she looks like me?
1762059 1763769 You know what he did?
1765104 1766355 He laughed.
1771068 1773946 And I laughed too,<br />like it was a joke.
1774029 1775572 How could it not be, right?
1777783 1779410 Made me so angry.
1780911 1783247 I hated myself for laughing.
1784915 1788002 I wanted to kick him so hard.
1789295 1790587 Not too hard.
1790671 1793882 Maybe just hard enough<br />to break his jaw off.
1797094 1798929 And right now,<br />you're probably regretting
1799013 1800514 sitting down with me.
1802683 1806562 This is the best thing<br />I've done in a long time.
1810941 1812651 I have to take this.
1816280 1817364 Hi, this is Tiff.
1817448 1818532 Oh, God, no.
1820576 1822578 I'll be right there.
1822661 1825497 My youngest<br />stuck a Lego up his nose.
1829084 1830127 I gotta go.
1832296 1834923 I hope I see you again.
1852858 1853984 There has been a report
1854068 1855569 of an emergency.
1855652 1857571 Proceed calmly<br />to the nearest exit
1857654 1859698 and leave the building<br />immediately.
1859782 1861158 What's going on?
1861241 1863077 We probably just got swatted<br />by some 14-year-old.
1863160 1864745 Yeah, someone pissed<br />about the latest update.
1864828 1866246 Or they're just a dick.
1866330 1869083 Please move to the exits.<br />Building's being evacuated.
1890354 1892022 Sir, this way.
1897861 1899029 Jude?
1900531 1901615 Jude!
1908080 1910040 At last.
1913210 1914670 I wasn't too sure<br />about the callback,
1914753 1916755 but, you know,<br />it was hard to resist.
1916839 1917965 What?
1918048 1919466 Morpheus Uno.<br />Reveal at the window.
1919550 1922010 Lightning,<br />thunder and theater.
1922094 1923971 At last.
1924054 1926473 All these years later,<br />here's me,
1926557 1928809 strolling out<br />of a toilet stall.
1928892 1930018 Tragedy or farce?
1930102 1931728 I know you.
1931812 1933814 Not every day<br />you meet your maker.
1933897 1935065 This can't be happening.
1935149 1936817 Oh, most definitely is.
1936900 1939361 You can't be<br />a character I coded.
1939445 1941488 100% natural.
1948954 1950164 How?
1950247 1952416 All the explanation you need.
1957337 1958505 No.
1958589 1960340 No, no, no.
1960424 1962217 What do you mean, no?
1962301 1964928 You wanted this, you did this.<br />This was your idea.
1965012 1969349 It was a test. An experiment.
1970642 1971852 An experiment?
1973395 1975355 You put me<br />in a tiny-ass Modal,
1975439 1976815 left me to bang my head till
1976899 1979151 I nearly lost my shit<br />searching for you
1979234 1980736 as an experiment.
1980819 1982821 - The exit's breaking down.<br />- He hasn't taken the pill.
1982905 1984239 What? There's no time.
1984323 1986366 I know, I know.<br />He's having a moment.
1986450 1988911 Does he know how hard it was<br />to hack that mirror?
1991246 1992873 Still open.
1992956 1996376 This... This can't be real.
1996460 1998295 Target acquired.<br />We got him.
2005886 2007221 This isn't happening.
2007304 2009765 It's in my mind.<br />It's in my mind.
2009848 2011058 Hey, you!<br />Stop! Hold it!
2027157 2028700 This can't be happening.
2031828 2033580 Freeze! Don't move!
2042548 2043674 Neo!
2058564 2059982 Oh, my God!
2094725 2095809 Neo!
2100689 2102899 Mr. Anderson!
2103734 2104985 No!
2105068 2106111 It can't be.
2114911 2116747 I've missed you.
2132012 2133680 It's in my mind.
2134806 2136183 It's in my mind.
2144358 2145859 Can you hear me, Thomas?
2147110 2149905 Follow my voice.
2149988 2153700 Feel the tips of your fingers.<br />What are they touching?
2155744 2157120 The bell.
2159623 2161041 Do you hear the bell?
2164461 2167506 Do you remember what happened?<br />How you got here?
2169132 2170425 You must have walked.
2170509 2171718 I heard Deja Vu outside,
2171802 2173053 opened my door,<br />and there you were.
2178392 2181228 You feel like<br />you can talk about it?
2181311 2182562 When we started<br />working together,
2182646 2184398 you had lost your capacity
2184481 2187025 to discern reality<br />from fiction.
2187109 2190278 You came to me after<br />trying to jump off a building.
2190362 2192656 You said you wanted<br />to fly away.
2206002 2208755 We have made<br />a lot of progress since then,
2208839 2211174 but you seem particularly<br />triggered right now.
2211258 2212718 Can you tell me<br />how it started?
2214720 2216430 He texted me.
2217597 2218932 Who?
2219015 2220475 Morpheus.
2223353 2224730 So, he's back.
2224813 2226982 It wasn't actually him.
2228150 2231445 It was a program<br />I coded for a Modal.
2231528 2233697 And this Modal, Morpheus,
2233780 2235782 came to help you escape
2235866 2239494 from a virtual reality<br />called The Matrix.
2249546 2251590 Am I crazy?
2251673 2254134 We don't use that word<br />in here.
2254217 2257137 What word should I use?
2257220 2260557 What word explains<br />what is happening to me?
2260640 2262309 Can I see the texts?
2264770 2266313 They were erased.
2271568 2274905 If we got in my car<br />and drove to your office,
2274988 2276948 what do you think<br />we'd find there?
2277032 2278074 Nothing.
2280786 2282871 Because there was no attack.
2284080 2285665 No one was killed.
2286583 2288710 No one texted.
2288794 2290837 My mind made it all up.
2292255 2294925 Is that what<br />I'm supposed to say?
2295008 2296510 Is that what you believe?
2297302 2299179 It felt real.
2299262 2301014 Of course.
2301097 2304017 It was your great ambition<br />to make a game
2304100 2306478 that was indistinguishable<br />from reality.
2306561 2308021 To achieve this goal,
2308104 2310565 you converted elements<br />of your life into narrative.
2310649 2312901 Your sublimated anger<br />toward your business partner
2312984 2315195 cast him as your nemesis.
2315278 2316905 A married woman named Tiffany
2316988 2320325 became the Trinity<br />of a doomed romance.
2320408 2324579 Even your dislike of my cat<br />made it into your Matrix.
2324663 2326456 There's nothing wrong<br />with that.
2326540 2327999 It's what artists do.
2328083 2331461 But it becomes a problem<br />when fantasies
2331545 2333880 endanger us or other people.
2336132 2338510 We don't want anyone<br />to get hurt,
2338593 2339970 do we, Thomas?
2348061 2350188 Hi, Thomas.<br />Everyone calls me Tiff.
2350272 2352691 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
2352774 2354401 No one can tell you<br />you're in love.
2354484 2356987 You just know it,<br />through and through.
2357070 2359573 Balls to bones.
2359656 2361449 You feel this?
2363159 2364870 I'm never letting go.
2372544 2374588 You have<br />to let it all go, Neo.
2374671 2377048 Free your mind.
2397360 2399362 Looks easy enough.
2406202 2408830 Free my mind. Shit.
2414002 2416046 Okay.
2416129 2417547 Free my mind.
2433772 2435315 I fly...
2436232 2438151 or I fall.
2445951 2447202 Who the hell are you?
2448078 2450163 You won't remember me,
2450246 2453500 but a long time ago,<br />you changed my life
2453583 2455961 when you leapt off<br />another roof.
2456044 2458964 Back then, I was just like<br />any other coppertop,
2459047 2460757 pretending my life...
2460840 2464970 until I looked up<br />and I saw you.
2465053 2467555 It was a different you,<br />but I saw
2468348 2470100 the real you,
2470183 2471977 just a second before...
2473436 2474521 you leapt.
2479275 2481069 And you never fell.
2486366 2488535 Are you the one<br />that hacked my Modal?
2489119 2490120 Yeah.
2491621 2493164 That'll be Jude.
2493248 2494582 He's not your friend.
2494666 2496126 He's a handle,<br />a program used to control you.
2496209 2497252 He's on his way here,
2497335 2499170 and he's bringing<br />Agents with him.
2500630 2501881 Jude.
2501965 2503383 Bro, I've been calling you<br />all night.
2503466 2505176 We have a major problemo.
2506720 2508304 Are you alone?
2511057 2513852 That's kind<br />of a sexy question, dude.
2513935 2516229 They don't look like<br />typical Agents.
2516312 2517731 They use bots now,<br />skinned as normal people,
2517814 2518940 which means they're everywhere
2519024 2521276 and you never know<br />who to trust.
2521359 2523111 Why should I trust you?
2525196 2528283 Because if they open<br />that door, we lose our hack.
2528366 2530076 I will be caught and killed
2530160 2531369 and you will be put right back
2531453 2532704 on that treadmill<br />they designed for you,
2532787 2533913 just like they did<br />the last time
2533997 2535165 you tried to leap<br />your way out.
2536499 2538918 I know why you left<br />your Modal open.
2539002 2541463 You needed someone else<br />to free Morpheus.
2541546 2543590 And it's because of him<br />that we were able to get to you.
2543673 2545550 I know these things<br />the same way
2545633 2548386 that I knew one day<br />I would find you.
2548470 2551097 And that when I did,<br />you would be ready for this.
2555685 2557062 If you want the truth, Neo,
2558313 2560315 you're going<br />to have to follow me.
2561858 2562859 Okay.
2582378 2585006 - Where are we?<br />- Tokyo.
2585090 2586925 A moving portal<br />makes it harder to track us.
2587008 2589636 - Seq is the best of them.<br />- Portal's clean.
2589719 2591137 Reading our shadows.
2592639 2595141 I don't remember this.
2595225 2597519 We don't have to run to<br />phone booths anymore either.
2607112 2608571 Door's on your right.
2622794 2625171 Set and setting, right?
2625255 2626548 Oh, no.
2626631 2628091 It's all about set
2628925 2630176 and setting.
2630260 2632387 After our first contact<br />went so badly,
2632470 2634347 we thought elements<br />from your past
2634430 2635932 might help ease you<br />into the present.
2636015 2638852 Nothing comforts anxiety like
2638935 2640353 a little nostalgia.
2640436 2642772 This is footage<br />from your game.
2649988 2651990 Time is<br />always against us,
2652866 2654909 etcetera, etcetera.
2656119 2657245 No one can be told
2657328 2660623 what the Matrix is,<br />blah, blah, blah.
2663209 2665170 You gotta see it<br />to believe it.
2668798 2670383 Time to fly.
2672427 2673887 Wait.
2673970 2675221 If this is real,
2675305 2677932 if I haven't lost my mind,<br />does that mean
2679642 2681019 this happened?
2689861 2691487 But if it did...
2695617 2697160 then we died.
2697243 2699162 Obviously not.
2699245 2700663 Why the Machines<br />kept you alive
2700747 2703625 and why they went<br />to such lengths to hide you
2703708 2705543 are questions<br />we don't have answers to.
2705627 2707212 Hide me?
2707295 2711591 I've been at a company making<br />a game called The Matrix.
2711674 2714260 Doesn't seem like they were<br />trying to hide anything.
2714344 2715887 We've been tracking<br />that company for years.
2715970 2718765 We screened every<br />Thomas Anderson we found.
2718848 2720433 What we didn't understand
2720516 2723019 was that they could<br />alter your DSI.
2723102 2724854 Pods generate<br />your digital self-image
2724938 2727440 through a feedback system<br />called Semblance.
2727523 2729525 This is how<br />you look to yourself.
2729609 2733321 Somehow they were able<br />to alter your DSI loop.
2733404 2735907 This is how<br />everyone else sees you.
2750004 2751965 Twenty years?
2753258 2756803 Why did it take 20 years<br />to find me?
2756886 2758721 It took a lot longer<br />than that.
2758805 2760807 It's been over 60 years<br />since you and Trinity
2760890 2762642 flew to one<br />of the Machine Cities.
2763351 2764310 What?
2764394 2766604 There's so much we don't know.
2766688 2768439 Like why you've barely aged,
2768523 2770733 or how many times<br />they've altered your DSI.
2770817 2772151 But based on<br />what we do know,
2772235 2773569 it appears no one found you
2773653 2775488 because you didn't<br />want to be found.
2775571 2778324 - That's not true.<br />- Maybe it isn't.
2778408 2779617 Maybe there's no foundation
2779701 2780868 to the rumors<br />that you disappeared,
2780952 2782120 because you were working
2782203 2783621 with the Machines<br />from the beginning.
2783705 2784831 Morpheus, stop.
2784914 2788042 All I'm saying is<br />this is the moment
2788126 2790670 for you to show us<br />what is real.
2790753 2792964 If you want out,
2793047 2794424 you'll take this pill.
2795925 2798344 But if you are<br />where you belong,
2798428 2800597 you can go back to this.
2800680 2802015 Every day.
2802098 2805727 Over and over forever.
2809188 2810398 Fuck.
2820450 2821617 Keep the loop tight.
2834047 2835214 Cybebe needs<br />that tower pin.
2835298 2837175 I got a signal. It's faint.
2837258 2838718 It's definitely off-grid.
2845600 2848019 Captain. I'm tracking<br />a whole lot of weird.
2848102 2849562 - What?<br />- It's some kind of graft.
2855818 2857111 Thomas?
2858279 2860073 Oh, God.
2860698 2862408 Oh, no.
2863743 2865912 - We got company.<br />- How'd they find us?
2867205 2870083 Thomas, none of this is real.
2870166 2874379 You are in the midst<br />of a serious psychotic break.
2874462 2876547 - Lexy?<br />- Almost there.
2876631 2878716 Thomas?
2878800 2881636 Thomas, please.<br />This is not a game.
2881719 2883221 Feel my hand.
2883304 2884514 This is what is real.
2887517 2889310 Stay with me.
2889394 2891020 No. No.
2893898 2895108 Stay with me.
2897777 2898778 Neo!
2902490 2903491 Morpheus!
2905034 2906452 Let's go, let's go!
2936858 2938943 - Bots are being activated.<br />- It's a swarm.
2963092 2964177 Come on!
2997627 2999128 I got a hack<br />in the bathroom. Hurry!
2999212 3000213 Yes.
3001005 3002006 Come on!
3004050 3005092 Seq, where?
3007220 3008888 - That mirror.<br />- What?
3008971 3010723 - We'll never fit.<br />- You gotta fit,
3010806 3012183 'cause I don't have<br />another way off this train.
3014310 3015811 No, no, no.
3015895 3017063 Think perspective.
3017146 3018940 Closer you are,<br />bigger it gets.
3022485 3024153 Okay, come on.
3025404 3026572 In you go.
3141437 3142813 Trinity.
3148152 3149153 No!
3230025 3232987 Welcome back<br />to the real world.
3241537 3242705 Trinity.
3242788 3243914 - What's up, Doc?<br />- His vital systems
3243998 3245458 have been<br />meticulously maintained,
3245541 3247418 but it doesn't look good.
3252757 3255176 - We're losing him.<br />- Cold boot could shock him.
3255760 3256802 Do it.
3269899 3271400 I remember this.
3274069 3275613 The Construct.
3276405 3279033 In between everything
3279116 3281243 and nothing.
3281327 3282995 Welcome to the Crib.
3284580 3286624 I've been chilling here<br />in the ship network...
3290002 3291629 learning all about you.
3296342 3297468 And me.
3301305 3305142 Careful. It'll do your head in.
3305226 3308771 Are memories turned<br />into fiction any less real?
3311941 3315194 Is reality based in memory<br />nothing but fiction?
3315277 3318531 As to my role in all this,<br />my best guess
3318614 3319907 is that you wrote me
3319990 3322034 as an algorithmic reflection<br />of two forces
3322117 3324620 that helped you become you,
3324703 3328165 Morpheus and Agent Smith.
3328249 3329375 A combo pack
3329458 3331961 of counterprogramming<br />that was...
3334755 3338592 Let's just say, more than<br />a little bit crazy-making.
3338676 3341595 But it worked<br />because here we are.
3342638 3344223 Now, for the bad news.
3344306 3346517 Your brain<br />is hooked on this shit
3346600 3349478 the Matrix has been<br />force-feeding you for years.
3349562 3351230 Hooked bad.
3351313 3352815 You're going through<br />major withdrawals.
3352898 3356110 Docbots are giving you<br />crap odds for surviving.
3356193 3358445 But, see,<br />they don't know you like I do.
3361323 3363534 I know exactly what you need.
3385389 3387099 You gotta be kidding.
3389226 3391020 No joke.
3391103 3395232 Could be this is the first day<br />of the rest of your life.
3395316 3397151 But if you want it...
3400779 3402114 you gotta fight for it.
3403240 3406201 No. I'm done fighting.
3407244 3408245 Are you?
3451580 3452998 What the hell is he doing?
3454166 3456961 Oh, yeah.<br />They taught you good.
3462424 3465678 Made you believe their world<br />was all you deserved.
3465761 3467680 But some part of you knew<br />that was a lie.
3467763 3470516 Some part of you remembered<br />what was real.
3473268 3474436 You don't know me.
3475062 3476105 No?
3518772 3520399 I know you, because I know
3520482 3522401 the only thing<br />that still matters to you.
3522484 3525654 I know it's why you're here,<br />why you're still fighting
3525738 3527322 and why you will<br />never give up.
3541503 3542838 Come on, Neo!
3544256 3545466 This is it.
3547593 3549178 This is your last chance.
3557144 3558604 You gotta fight<br />for your goddamn life
3558687 3560022 if you want to see<br />Trinity again.
3564943 3566320 Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
3568947 3571575 - Holy shit.<br />- Fight for her!
3623627 3625337 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
3627256 3628757 Mind if I...
3641937 3643438 How are you doing?
3644982 3647109 If this plug is actually real,
3649069 3651405 that means<br />they took my life...
3653949 3656326 and turned it<br />into a video game.
3659454 3661081 How am I doing?
3662040 3664084 I don't know.
3664168 3666336 I don't even know how to know.
3667462 3668922 That's it, isn't it?
3670424 3672634 If we don't know<br />what's real...
3674720 3675846 we can't resist.
3678765 3680225 They took your story,
3680309 3681810 something that meant
3682895 3685147 so much to people like me,
3686773 3689443 and turned it<br />into something trivial.
3691236 3693030 That's what the Matrix does.
3693864 3696074 It weaponizes every idea.
3696825 3698243 Every dream.
3699745 3701538 Everything<br />that's important to us.
3703999 3706293 Where better to bury truth<br />than inside something
3706376 3709421 as ordinary as a video game?
3709504 3711506 That sounds like the Oracle.
3712925 3714718 Heard so much about her.
3717512 3719056 She was gone<br />before I was free.
3720682 3722100 Gone?
3722184 3725020 When this new version<br />of the Matrix was uploaded,
3726521 3728065 there was a purge.
3732945 3736698 They promised peace<br />and they gave us purge.
3738158 3739618 No.
3739701 3741411 No, there was peace.
3742829 3747960 You made it possible,<br />and it changed everything.
3748043 3751546 Doesn't feel like<br />it changed anything.
3751630 3754841 The Matrix is<br />the same or worse.
3754925 3757135 And I'm back where I started.
3759888 3762349 It feels like<br />everything I did,
3763392 3764893 everything we did...
3770899 3773110 like none of it mattered.
3775320 3776989 All of it mattered.
3778740 3780242 I can show you.
3790919 3792504 This is my crew.
3795632 3797801 Our operator, Seq.
3800012 3803890 Sequoia. But everybody<br />calls me Seq.
3803974 3805434 Nice to meet you.
3806476 3808520 Dad loved redwoods.
3808603 3809855 When he escaped the Matrix
3809938 3811481 and found out<br />they no longer existed,
3811565 3813066 it almost killed him.
3813150 3814359 Lucky, he met Mom
3815235 3816862 and here I am.
3816945 3820657 This is Lexy,<br />Berg and Ellster.
3821408 3822534 Hi.
3822617 3825203 You knew my grandfather,<br />Captain Roland.
3825287 3827748 Roland was your grandfather?
3828540 3829624 He always laughed,
3829708 3830667 joking how he never<br />believed in you.
3831793 3833211 But, in private, he said that
3833295 3835422 you freed his mind<br />a second time.
3835505 3837549 Not to fanboy out here,
3837632 3839634 but this is kind<br />of a huge moment for me.
3839718 3842220 Berg is our resident<br />Neo-ologist.
3842304 3843513 A what?
3843597 3846641 There's a lot of people<br />out there like me
3846725 3849061 who are a little bit<br />obsessed with your life.
3849144 3850312 I would never have recognized
3850395 3851521 your Modal<br />if it weren't for him.
3851605 3852856 Whenever<br />you're feeling up for it,
3852939 3854900 I've got, like,<br />a million questions.
3854983 3857444 Me too. Starting with them.
3858779 3859821 It's okay.
3860572 3861823 Come meet him.
3861907 3863200 This is Cybebe.
3863283 3864701 That's Octacles.
3864785 3867454 That's Lumin8.
3867537 3869790 Machines are on our side now?
3869873 3871083 They are synthients.
3871166 3872834 It's a word<br />they prefer to Machines.
3872918 3874252 Your contact<br />with the Synthient City
3874336 3876713 had a huge impact<br />on their world.
3876797 3877923 That's what I meant.
3878006 3879257 What you changed
3879341 3880926 that nobody believed<br />could ever be changed.
3882844 3885347 The meaning of our side.
3889142 3890977 Cybebe and Octacles<br />risked their lives
3891061 3892229 to help get you out.
3893688 3894689 Thank you.
3896233 3897275 But why?
3897359 3899903 Not all seek to control.
3899986 3901988 Just as not all wish<br />to be free.
3903782 3905033 What is that?
3905117 3907411 An exomorphic-particle codex.<br />It's pretty new.
3907494 3909621 It gives programs<br />access to this world.
3909704 3910914 Within limits.
3910997 3914000 Limits are the domain<br />of the limited.
3914084 3915627 Morpheus.
3915710 3916753 Thank you.
3916837 3918255 It was my honor.
3921383 3922551 How does it work?
3922634 3924136 Paramagnetic oscillation.
3924219 3926721 If you want, I can download<br />the codex manual for you.
3926805 3929224 - Sure.<br />- Downloading used to be fun.
3929307 3931685 Now it's all manuals<br />and diagnostics.
3931768 3933478 Can I ask them something?
3936398 3939651 When you unplugged me,<br />there was another pod?
3940986 3943864 Yes. We've analyzed the data.
3945073 3946408 It could be Trinity.
3947242 3948827 It's her.
3948910 3951997 I figured we were going<br />to have this conversation.
3952080 3955000 Look, you were not<br />a typical flush-and-grab.
3955083 3956751 You were in this weird tower<br />that Cybebe
3956835 3958920 had never accessed,<br />and she's now exiled.
3959004 3961381 We burned<br />our one shot for you.
3961465 3963508 Even if it were Trinity<br />and she wanted to be free,
3963592 3965635 we have no idea how to do it.
3965719 3966720 Yet.
3969139 3972017 Nobody believed<br />we'd ever find him,
3972100 3973143 but we did.
3975562 3977481 Okay.
3977564 3980692 We don't know<br />how to get her out... yet.
3982736 3985405 Captain, we're approaching<br />security clearance.
3986698 3987866 We're here.
3987949 3988992 Zion?
3997083 3998543 Have a seat.
3998627 4001379 This is Hanno.<br />Best pilot in our fleet.
4001463 4002422 Quite a few synthients
4002506 4003965 deserve that title before me.
4004049 4005217 Mnemosyne, you are cleared
4005300 4006676 for landing. Welcome home.
4006760 4008428 Thank you, Control.
4008512 4010096 We're about to crash.
4017020 4020398 General realized we were never going to<br />beat the Sentinels, so...
4020482 4022609 we just got better<br />at hiding from them.
4027197 4028782 Welcome to Io.
4030408 4031826 Io.
4038250 4041002 That looks real.
4041503 4043088 Bio-sky.
4046675 4049010 Works kind of like<br />grow lights.
4049094 4050762 It's way more complex<br />than that.
4050845 4053306 It pulls water from the crust,<br />hydronating the air.
4053390 4056726 It balances the ECO<br />and our SRI cycles.
4057811 4059145 Plus...
4059980 4061773 it is pretty to look at.
4061856 4063650 As opposed to that.
4064943 4067529 I guess the general sent us<br />a welcome party.
4085797 4087215 God damn.
4088300 4089509 It is you.
4090385 4091553 Niobe?
4093388 4096975 A few more wrinkles<br />and a few less teeth,
4097058 4100729 but wise enough to know<br />I don't know anything.
4100812 4103481 I sure as shit<br />never saw this coming.
4104316 4105483 Neither did I.
4105567 4106901 I told you he was alive.
4106985 4108945 Captain, you and your crew<br />have been grounded.
4109029 4110655 General,<br />if you'd just let me explain.
4110739 4113366 The protocols are put in place<br />for everyone's protection.
4113450 4115327 I'm sorry.<br />I saw an opportunity
4115410 4116870 and I was afraid<br />we'd lose him.
4116953 4119623 But, General, people have been<br />waiting for so long.
4121291 4122542 We found The One.
4124377 4126087 I don't believe in The One.
4128340 4129466 I never did.
4130133 4131217 No?
4132302 4133845 Me neither.
4133928 4136306 But there was a time
4136389 4139059 when you trusted me<br />with your ship,
4139142 4140935 against the Council's orders.
4141019 4143104 The world was different then.
4144939 4146566 We were different.
4148610 4150028 Report to the docks.
4150111 4151821 Scrub down the Mnemosyne.
4151905 4154199 Transfer your access codes.
4154282 4155700 You are done, Captain.
4165377 4167212 We need to talk.
4172425 4175095 When word first came
4175178 4177430 that it actually might be you...
4181184 4184979 I didn't know how I would feel<br />in this moment.
4192862 4194823 It is nice to see you.
4194906 4197617 It's good to see you too.
4203498 4206251 A long way<br />from Dozer's paint stripper.
4206334 4209295 Yes.
4209379 4211131 A lot has changed.
4212674 4214592 Except maybe you.
4217387 4218930 You remember this?
4226020 4228773 It's so easy to forget<br />how much noise
4228857 4230775 the Matrix pumps<br />into your head
4230859 4232652 until you unplug.
4234112 4235488 Yeah.
4235572 4238491 Something else<br />makes the same kind of noise.
4238575 4240785 Takes over every damn thing,
4240869 4242579 just like the Matrix.
4244247 4245248 War.
4246958 4249586 I stood at the barricade<br />of the Temple.
4251379 4253673 Staring at the army of Sentinels,
4254799 4257427 waiting for them<br />to kill every one of us.
4258887 4261973 But then, they left.
4263183 4265643 They said you saved us.
4265727 4266895 I didn't believe it.
4266978 4270315 Every night I would dream<br />of attack sirens.
4270982 4272233 But then,
4274819 4277030 I would wake up to this...
4281034 4282494 silence.
4285955 4287499 I'm ashamed of it now.
4287582 4291586 My pessimism of how long<br />it took me to believe
4291669 4294923 a world without war<br />was possible.
4296341 4298343 You gave me that.
4298426 4301304 You gave that gift to us all.
4301387 4305058 And it is the gift<br />that continues to bear fruit.
4307769 4309521 Come help me get up.
4309604 4311356 Let's take a walk.
4335463 4337465 Beautiful.
4338550 4341511 This is Freya, head of botany.
4341594 4344889 And this is Quillion,<br />our lead digitologist.
4344973 4348977 I presume our guest<br />needs no introduction.
4349060 4351729 Nothing travels<br />faster than light,
4351813 4353064 except gossip.
4355441 4356860 Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
4358903 4360071 A strawberry?
4360154 4361865 Using digital code<br />from the Matrix,
4361948 4364367 we retro-convert it<br />into DNA sequences.
4364450 4365869 And they grow here?
4365952 4367579 It's not easy<br />augmenting the genome
4367662 4370206 to photosynthesize<br />Bio-sky, but...
4370290 4372041 We're getting there.
4372792 4374502 Go ahead. Try it.
4382010 4384220 We're quite excited<br />about the blueberries.
4384304 4386222 You remember that shit<br />we used to eat?
4386306 4388683 That slop<br />that tasted like rust.
4390268 4393897 Zion could have never<br />made something like this.
4393980 4395607 Why?
4395690 4398276 Because we needed synthients
4398359 4400320 and DI like him.
4400403 4403781 Zion was stuck in the past.<br />Stuck in war.
4403865 4406242 Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
4406326 4410204 They believed<br />that it had to be us or them.
4410288 4413291 This city was built by us
4413374 4415043 and them.
4420715 4422258 What happened to Zion?
4422342 4425762 I've been waiting<br />for you to ask that question.
4427722 4431184 All of the troubles<br />started in the Machine Cities.
4431267 4434979 Power plants were unable<br />to produce enough energy.
4435063 4438816 Nothing can breed violence<br />like scarcity.
4440568 4442153 For the first time,
4442236 4445448 we saw machines at war<br />with one other.
4448451 4452455 We got word from the Oracle<br />of a new power rising.
4454415 4457085 That was the last<br />we heard from her.
4460755 4462131 Morpheus.
4462215 4466594 After the siege,<br />he was elected unanimously.
4466678 4469555 High Chair of the Council.
4469639 4473059 Oh, how he loved that.
4473142 4477355 But as rumors<br />of this new power spread,
4477438 4478856 he ignored them.
4478940 4483569 He was certain what you had<br />done could not be undone.
4483653 4487615 All of these people never<br />stopped believing in miracles,
4487699 4490076 believing in you.
4502130 4503506 I'm sorry.
4505341 4507760 How could I know<br />this would happen?
4507844 4510138 We didn't understand<br />all of it back then.
4510221 4512056 No more than we do now.
4512140 4515435 I didn't come here<br />to cause you problems, Niobe,
4516477 4518229 but I need your help.
4519897 4521357 Trinity is alive.
4521441 4523192 Then there is<br />another question.
4523276 4525069 Why did they keep her alive?
4525153 4526404 I can't answer that.
4526487 4529824 But if there's a chance<br />I can free her,
4529907 4531451 I have to try.
4531534 4535455 Even if it means endangering<br />everyone in this city?
4539709 4541419 I'm sorry, Neo.
4541502 4545173 I won't let what happened<br />to Zion happen to Io.
4546966 4548342 I hope you'll forgive<br />an old woman
4548426 4551512 for asking you to go<br />with Sheperd here,
4551596 4553097 till we have<br />better understanding
4553181 4554599 of what's going on.
4554682 4557727 You're going to imprison me<br />after I just got free?
4557810 4561606 I know it doesn't seem fair,
4561689 4564484 but neither does growing old.
4564567 4566694 But you don't<br />hear me complaining.
4578706 4580541 Sorry.
4580625 4582668 I've never met<br />a legend before.
4586047 4587131 Neo.
4588424 4590176 Sheperd.
4591552 4593387 Crazy. You're real.
4595348 4596474 Real.
4597558 4599560 There's that word again.
4605066 4607443 People talk a lot<br />about the old days.
4607527 4609779 About you, the viral Agent.
4609862 4612490 The siege of Zion.
4612573 4614575 Everything was simpler<br />back then.
4615576 4617161 People wanted to be free.
4619247 4621165 It's different now.
4621249 4624710 Sometimes it feels like<br />people gave up.
4625962 4627672 Like the Matrix won.
4630466 4631884 This is you.
4635888 4638182 And I gotta ask you one thing.
4640226 4641936 Is it true you could fly?
4646774 4647775 Cool.
4678306 4679599 Morpheus.
4679682 4682602 General stuck you<br />in the Rapunzel tower.
4685062 4686564 On the upside,<br />it's a nice view.
4686647 4688733 What happened to Bugs<br />and the others?
4688816 4690526 They're supposed to be<br />sterilizing the Mnemosyne
4690610 4692737 - with a toothbrush.<br />- Supposed to be?
4692820 4694155 Well, I could tell you<br />that they're standing by,
4694238 4695489 waiting for you<br />to make the choice
4695573 4697408 to remain meekly incarcerated
4697492 4699827 or bust the hell out of here<br />and go and find Trinity.
4701412 4702497 But that ain't a choice.
4715134 4717261 General,<br />what should we do?
4720681 4723267 Bugs has the same<br />independence of mind
4723351 4724810 she had the day you freed her.
4724894 4727897 This is not<br />independence of mind.
4727980 4729023 It's mutiny.
4730358 4731609 Come on, 'Be.
4731692 4734695 I know how much<br />you hated locking him up.
4734779 4737490 Just like I know<br />there's a part of you
4737573 4740618 that's relieved now<br />that he's gone.
4742078 4745915 We've worked so hard<br />to keep Io safe.
4748668 4750294 This scares me.
4760846 4762139 That's her.
4762223 4763349 On the bridge.
4763891 4764892 Got her.
4773568 4775820 It's sick<br />how the Semblance works.
4775903 4778656 You see flashes<br />of the real her, but...
4778739 4780366 the way she reads...
4782076 4784704 Code-wise,<br />she's pure bluepill.
4786580 4789667 This is a tough question, Neo,<br />but it has to be asked.
4790793 4792962 What if she's happy<br />where she is?
4794422 4795673 How did I read?
4797758 4799677 Exactly like her.
4803431 4805683 Take us to broadcast depth.
4816986 4818446 Thank you for helping me.
4820072 4822074 Most of us are here<br />because of you.
4824744 4825870 I also admit our only chance
4825953 4827371 to get out<br />of the general's doghouse
4827455 4829081 is for you to find your mojo.
4830791 4833377 What if I can't be<br />what I once was?
4834920 4836547 Then we're all fucked.
4836630 4838007 Two minutes.
4838090 4839467 Two minutes to broadcast.
4848642 4849977 I slipped you in<br />through a hotel room.
4851812 4853272 Should be safe.
4864075 4865576 Portal's open.
4865659 4867787 Closest I could get you is<br />the warehouse near her garage.
4867870 4869413 Whole zone's crawling with bots.
4870790 4872333 Let's go.
4899568 4902696 So, what do you think of him?
4902780 4905574 I was kinda worried at first<br />because he's so much older.
4905658 4908160 The beard, the hair...
4908244 4911664 - No, totally works for me.<br />- You idiot.
4911747 4913124 I mean The One thing.
4914792 4917753 You know, everyone that<br />shipped with him died.
4917837 4920631 Oh, yeah. He's gonna<br />get us all killed, for sure.
4926011 4927555 Predictable as ever.
4929807 4931559 Smith.
4931642 4933978 Smith? As in, the Smith?
4942111 4943404 This is so insane.
4943487 4944738 There's so many theories<br />about the two of them
4944822 4946490 and they're standing<br />right there.
4946574 4948159 This code is freaky!
4948242 4951120 He's like an Agent, but not.
4955291 4956876 An appeal to reason.
4961088 4962590 How did you find us?
4962673 4965593 You never appreciated<br />our relationship.
4965676 4967052 Not like The Analyst.
4967136 4969054 - The what?<br />- My doctor.
4969138 4972850 He used our bond<br />and turned it into a chain.
4972933 4974602 It's so obvious<br />once you see it, right?
4974685 4978105 But this whole altered-code<br />update really blew my mind.
4978189 4980191 I still don't know<br />how he did it.
4980274 4983068 You, as a balding nerd.
4983152 4984904 Hilarious.
4984987 4987364 And me...
4987448 4990117 even more perfect.
4990201 4992203 Maybe a little too far<br />on the piercing blue eyes.
4992286 4994205 What do you think?
4994288 4996248 What do you want, Smith?
4998417 5000711 I have such dreams, Tom.
5000794 5002505 Big dreams.
5002588 5005341 Well, mostly just extremely<br />violent revenge fantasies,
5005424 5006842 but in order for me<br />to pursue mine,
5006926 5008969 I need to dissuade you<br />from pursuing yours.
5009053 5012681 Sounds like conflict.
5014391 5015935 Inevitable?
5017144 5018479 Doesn't have to be.
5018562 5020731 All you have to do<br />is stay out of the Matrix,
5020814 5022316 and leave<br />the good doctor to me.
5022399 5024735 You can have him.<br />I'm here for Trinity.
5024818 5026320 That's the trouble, Tom.
5026403 5029073 He knew you'd come,<br />just like I did.
5030824 5032034 Trust me.
5032993 5034537 You're not ready for him.
5034620 5037414 Captain, I'm reading portals<br />from the lower frequencies.
5042711 5045881 I won't have his leash<br />on my neck again.
5053347 5055599 I found some<br />old acquaintances of yours.
5056642 5060020 Bugs!
5073701 5074743 Exiles.
5074827 5075995 I thought<br />they were all purged.
5076078 5077580 You?
5078872 5081208 It is you!
5082543 5086130 All these years.<br />I can't believe it.
5086797 5088465 Oh, God.
5088549 5092511 You stole my life!
5097266 5098809 What the Merv is trying to say,
5098892 5101353 is that their situation<br />is a little bit like mine.
5101437 5103647 To have their lives back,<br />yours has to end.
5107318 5108402 Kill him!
5121624 5124084 You ruined
5124168 5127296 every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
5127379 5129965 We had grace.
5135012 5136555 We had style!
5136639 5138641 We had conversation!
5138724 5140684 Not this...
5165209 5168754 Art, films,<br />books were all better!
5168837 5172049 Originality mattered!
5172132 5174051 You gave us<br />Face-Zucker-suck
5174134 5177596 and Cock-me-climatey<br />Wiki-piss-and-shit!
5223726 5225310 I still know kung fu.
5227187 5228188 Neo!
5257885 5259386 Just like old times.
5317027 5318070 Neo.
5319988 5322658 I've been thinking<br />about us, Tom.
5322741 5326036 Look how binary is the form,<br />the nature of things.
5327287 5328580 Ones and zeros.
5329790 5330916 Light and dark.
5333043 5335087 Choice and its absence.
5338465 5340717 Anderson and Smith.
5377337 5379548 You've lost something, Tom.
5383510 5385345 You're not<br />what you used to be.
5386597 5387681 It's true.
5401028 5403030 - Nice one.<br />- Thanks.
5410871 5412080 Come on, Neo.
5437064 5439608 Captain. You okay?
5439691 5442653 Yeah. Where's Neo?
5442736 5443862 Smith is killing him.
5443946 5445322 Where?
5452829 5454831 I feel bad about this, Tom.
5457417 5459544 After all, you are the one<br />who set me free...
5460837 5461838 again.
5463882 5464967 So, you, more than anyone,
5465050 5466677 understands why<br />I can't go back.
5469262 5471056 You should have<br />listened to me.
5473266 5475018 Now you'll never<br />see her again.
5488615 5489783 What was that?
5489866 5491243 That was Neo.
5492869 5493870 Mojo rising.
5501920 5503380 You all right?
5503463 5504965 Yeah.
5505048 5506216 It's gonna trigger a response.
5506300 5507509 I got multiple exits ready.
5507592 5509052 This is not over yet!
5509136 5511847 Our sequel franchise spinoff!
5518895 5520313 We should go.
5520397 5521565 I can't.
5521648 5523567 I have to talk to her.
5523650 5525902 Neo, those Exiles<br />were older than you,
5525986 5527070 and we barely handled them.
5530657 5532200 You really wanna do this now?
5537622 5538832 I mean...
5542836 5544421 you look like shit.
5555682 5558226 Oh, my God. What?<br />What happened?
5558310 5559436 An accident.
5559519 5561855 Kush! Call a doctor.
5561938 5563482 It's fine.
5564399 5566526 I don't have a lot of time.
5566610 5568320 I wasn't sure<br />I'd see you again.
5568403 5570989 After we spoke, I realized...
5571865 5573909 my life wasn't a life.
5575368 5578121 At some point,<br />I think I gave up
5578205 5580457 searching for something real.
5586797 5588090 Wait.
5589549 5592135 Something happened.
5592219 5594596 I looked for you<br />at the coffee shop.
5596389 5598725 I began to wonder<br />if I imagined you.
5599893 5602437 And then last night<br />I had a dream.
5602521 5605315 In the dream, you were<br />surrounded by police,
5605398 5607943 then they started chasing us.
5608026 5611029 - Us?<br />- You were on my bike with me.
5613198 5614574 How did it end?
5615992 5617160 Not good.
5619704 5623125 I've had dreams<br />that weren't just dreams.
5623208 5625460 You mean a dream<br />that came true?
5633135 5635762 Finally, we can talk<br />like adults.
5637430 5640559 I hate lying. I do.<br />It exhausts me.
5642352 5644437 Tiff and I have been<br />waiting for you...
5644521 5645772 like, forever.
5652863 5654156 Deja vu, right?
5655949 5658118 Oh, no use.<br />You can't beat time.
5658201 5661913 This rewind is happening<br />faster than you can blink.
5666793 5668795 You gave me the idea.
5671631 5674926 Allow me to sum up our goal<br />in a single word.
5677971 5679097 Bullet time.
5680932 5682893 I know. Kind of ironic,
5682976 5686897 using the power that defined you<br />to control you.
5686980 5689608 I kept such a close eye on you
5689691 5692235 and still you found a way out.
5692319 5694696 Clever monkey,<br />using that Modal.
5695655 5696823 Call me an optimist,
5696907 5699075 but this could<br />all be for the best.
5699159 5701995 The skin's not looking<br />too bad this time.
5702078 5704706 I know some of this will be<br />difficult for you to hear,
5704789 5706249 after everything<br />you went through.
5706333 5707709 All that pain and suffering,
5707792 5710629 only to learn the world<br />doesn't end when you do.
5712172 5713256 Surprise.
5719262 5720680 I was there when you died.
5723183 5724309 I said to myself...
5724392 5727604 Here is the anomaly<br />of anomalies.
5727687 5730482 What an extraordinary<br />opportunity.
5732150 5733610 First, I had to convince<br />the Suits
5733693 5735111 to let me rebuild<br />the two of you.
5735195 5736780 Why her? Getting there.
5736863 5738657 And don't worry,<br />she can't hear me.
5738740 5741868 Resurrecting you both<br />was crazy expensive.
5741952 5743286 Like renovating a house.
5743370 5745622 Took twice as long,<br />cost twice as much.
5749709 5752170 I thought you'd be happy<br />to be alive again.
5753213 5754464 So wrong.
5756258 5759886 Did you know hope and despair<br />are nearly identical in code?
5761888 5763848 We worked for years,
5763932 5765559 trying to activate<br />your source code.
5765642 5769062 I was about to give up,<br />when I realized...
5772148 5773191 Trinity.
5773275 5775443 It was never just you.
5775527 5778613 Alone, neither of you<br />is of any particular value.
5780323 5781491 Like acids and bases,
5781574 5783952 you're dangerous<br />when mixed together.
5784035 5786997 Every sim<br />where you two bonded...
5787080 5789165 Let's just say<br />bad things happened.
5791209 5792669 Neo!
5796923 5800302 However, as long as I managed<br />to keep you close,
5800385 5802053 but not too close,
5802137 5805348 I discovered<br />something incredible.
5805432 5808935 Now, my predecessor<br />loved precision.
5809019 5812689 His Matrix was all fussy facts<br />and equations.
5812772 5814524 He hated the human mind.
5814607 5816026 So he never bothered<br />to realize
5816109 5817277 that you don't give a shit<br />about facts.
5817360 5818778 It's all about fiction.
5818862 5823533 The only world that matters<br />is the one in here.
5823617 5826619 And you people<br />believe the craziest shit.
5827162 5828413 Why?
5828496 5831082 What validates<br />and makes your fictions real?
5832042 5833126 Feelings.
5834294 5835754 Allow me.
5837130 5838798 Kush, here,<br />is one of my handlers.
5838882 5840216 They're everywhere.
5840300 5842886 Such a pain, cloning Agents<br />over a coppertop.
5842969 5845430 Far more effective<br />just to saturate a population.
5847349 5850226 And, bonus,<br />swarm mode is sick fun.
5862655 5865784 Nicely done.
5867243 5870497 You ever wonder<br />why you have nightmares?
5870580 5873541 Why your own brain<br />tortures you?
5873625 5877128 It's actually us,<br />maximizing your output.
5877212 5878380 It works just like this.
5878463 5881091 Oh, no!<br />Can you stop the bullet?
5881174 5884094 If only you could move faster.
5884177 5886721 Here's the thing<br />about feelings.
5886805 5889099 They're so much easier<br />to control than facts.
5890058 5891935 Turns out, in my Matrix,
5892018 5895480 the worse we treat you,<br />the more we manipulate you,
5895563 5898024 the more energy you produce.
5898108 5900318 It's nuts.
5900402 5901986 I've been setting<br />productivity records
5902070 5903363 every year since I took over.
5903446 5906282 And, the best part,<br />zero resistance.
5906366 5907742 People stay in their pods,
5907826 5910912 happier than pigs in shit.
5910995 5912205 The key to it all?
5912288 5913623 You.
5913706 5914874 And her.
5914958 5917168 Quietly yearning<br />for what you don't have,
5917252 5919671 while dreading<br />losing what you do.
5919754 5921423 For 99.9% of your race,
5921506 5924175 that is the definition<br />of reality.
5924259 5927137 Desire and fear, baby.
5927220 5930181 Just give the people<br />what they want, right?
5939482 5942527 She's the only home<br />you have, Thomas.
5942610 5945905 Come home before<br />something terrible happens.
5956332 5957625 - Bugs!<br />- I hear him.
5964007 5965175 Trinity!
5965258 5966968 - You shouldn't call me that.<br />- I'm sorry.
5968470 5969721 I have to go.
5969804 5970972 But I'll be back.
5972098 5974392 Neo! Time to go.
5976895 5978605 - Sentinels?<br />- Worse.
5980064 5982233 General ordered me<br />to look after the ship.
5982317 5984194 So you shadowed us?
5984277 5985862 Check your long-range scans.
5985945 5987947 Squids are combing this area.
5988031 5989491 He's right.
5989574 5990742 You can stay here and die,
5990825 5993203 or come back<br />and face a court-martial.
5993286 5995288 And you call that a choice?
6002504 6004631 Sheperd should have<br />left you to the Squids.
6004714 6008092 I'm too damn old to sit<br />through some boring-ass trial.
6008176 6009385 Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
6009469 6011387 Do shut your mouth.
6011471 6013765 Do address me as General.
6013848 6018102 And do not rob<br />my ex-captain of her agency,
6018186 6020188 which she exercised<br />with her own
6020271 6023775 particular brand<br />of shortsighted stupidity.
6025026 6026110 Shortsighted?
6027779 6031741 You care more about growing fruit<br />than freeing minds.
6031824 6034327 We are not going<br />to have this argument again.
6034410 6036746 It's not an argument.<br />It's a fact.
6036829 6038039 You gave up on people.
6039499 6041834 I tell you<br />what I'm going to give up on
6041918 6043002 and it's you!
6045421 6047340 Sheperd, get her<br />out of my sight!
6047423 6048550 General...
6050468 6051553 Disarm!
6051636 6053263 Kujaku's a friend.
6059811 6061437 Hello, friend.
6064023 6065024 Okay.
6066359 6067569 Him?
6074492 6076160 General.
6076244 6077537 Thank you for seeing me.
6077620 6079414 I figured if there was anyone
6079497 6081791 who could make sense<br />of this mess,
6081874 6083668 it would be you.
6083751 6084877 Hello, Neo.
6084961 6086796 I know you.
6086879 6088881 I tried to keep my eye on you.
6092218 6093469 Why?
6093553 6095305 We met a long time ago.
6097015 6098099 Good morning.
6100893 6101894 Sati.
6101978 6104480 My father knew<br />we'd meet again,
6104564 6107525 though he would have wished<br />for happier circumstances.
6107609 6109402 His inadvertent role<br />in what happened to you
6109485 6111738 was the greatest regret<br />of his life.
6111821 6113698 I don't understand.
6115074 6116743 My father<br />was the chief engineer
6116826 6118077 at the Anomaleum.
6118161 6119537 The what?
6119621 6122707 My father designed<br />the resurrection pods
6122790 6124709 where Neo and Trinity<br />were imprisoned.
6126753 6128004 I'm sorry.
6128087 6129589 You knew what happened to him?
6129672 6132884 You knew that he and Trinity<br />both were alive...
6133885 6135178 and you didn't tell me?
6135261 6138181 There were times<br />I doubted my decision, Niobe.
6138264 6139891 But Io needed you.
6139974 6141309 This city needed to be built
6141392 6143436 for your people<br />as well as mine.
6144604 6146356 If I would have<br />told you everything,
6146439 6148608 you would have had a very<br />difficult choice to make.
6148691 6150276 My friends
6151611 6154113 let me make my own choices.
6154197 6156115 If it was a mistake,
6156199 6158284 you have my deepest apologies.
6160370 6161704 Why are you here now?
6161788 6164290 Neo's escape has<br />destabilized the Matrix.
6164374 6165625 The Anomaleum<br />draws its current
6165708 6167043 from Trinity alone now.
6167126 6169295 A fail-safe has been<br />triggered to reset
6169379 6171381 the Matrix back<br />to the previous version.
6171464 6173257 But The Analyst<br />halted the reset.
6173341 6174634 He's convinced the authorities
6174717 6176678 that you will soon<br />return voluntarily.
6177804 6179722 And why would he say that?
6179806 6182892 Because if I don't go back,<br />he'll kill Trinity.
6185645 6188022 Faced with returning<br />to your pod
6188106 6190900 or enduring<br />Trinity's death again.
6190983 6192276 What would you choose, Neo?
6193361 6194654 I'll go back.
6196364 6198574 Well, The Analyst<br />knows you well,
6198658 6201411 but that knowledge<br />has made him incautious.
6201494 6203162 After you escaped,
6203246 6206082 he should have accepted his losses<br />and devacuated Trinity.
6206165 6209043 But that would have prevented<br />this extraordinary opportunity
6209127 6211045 that now exists before us.
6211713 6214632 A few hours ago,
6214716 6218010 no one would have been able<br />to convince me
6218094 6222390 that I would be standing here,<br />trying to explain a mission
6222473 6224434 as crazy as this one.
6228229 6229856 What are you doing?
6229939 6231482 - Volunteering.<br />- Oh, no.
6231566 6236112 You are the one captain<br />that I am ordering to go.
6236195 6237780 Now you don't<br />have to order me, General,
6237864 6239532 'cause I'm volunteering.
6242910 6244454 I need two more.
6248958 6251794 Are you out of your minds?
6251878 6253755 You don't even know<br />what it is.
6253838 6256758 General, we know you.
6256841 6258050 If you say this is important,
6258134 6260178 none of us is<br />choosing to stay home.
6265558 6266642 Thank you.
6271731 6273733 Knuckle up, and good luck.
6303763 6305264 Trinity is held<br />in the Anomaleum,
6305348 6307099 which is in this<br />transmission tower.
6307183 6309435 The passages used<br />to rescue Neo are now sealed
6309519 6311729 and a legion of Sentinels<br />patrols the tower.
6311813 6313856 So, stealth will be paramount.
6313940 6315691 As long as we raise no alarms,
6315775 6317860 this first part of the mission<br />should be the easiest.
6317944 6319195 You mean<br />crossing the Fetus Fields,
6319278 6321030 sneaking across<br />an entire power plant,
6321113 6322532 climbing<br />a two-kilometer tower
6322615 6324450 guarded by thousands<br />of Sentinels?
6324534 6325701 That's the easy part?
6325785 6327453 Exactly so.
6327537 6329872 Because all we have to do<br />is convince someone
6329956 6331624 who does this every day
6331707 6333125 to take one of us along.
6356649 6358484 Fifty meters<br />below the Anomaleum
6358568 6360069 is a stratum<br />of amniotic filters.
6360152 6363573 Hidden along this edge<br />is a small hexagonal vent.
6363656 6366826 This vent feeds the air intake<br />into the corpuscular modifier,
6366909 6369996 which oxygenates<br />the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.
6370663 6371873 I get it.
6371956 6374834 The exomorph slinkies up<br />Neo's old umbilicus.
6376085 6377211 What could go wrong?
6424091 6425468 Once inside,
6425551 6427386 Morpheus will use<br />the System Operator
6427470 6429805 to open the devacuator line<br />and disengage the macerators.
6433893 6435478 In order to unplug<br />Trinity's body,
6435561 6437772 while her mind still remains<br />connected to the Matrix,
6437855 6439482 I'm gonna need<br />a second human brain
6439565 6440775 to implement the bypass.
6440858 6442485 And since Neo<br />must be with The Analyst,
6442568 6445738 the only available mind<br />that's a near-enough match
6445821 6446864 is yours.
6448407 6449325 Figures.
6466842 6467969 Thanks, Cybebe.
6476185 6478187 Does Trinity still have<br />to take the red pill?
6478270 6479689 Since Kujaku and I<br />are transferring
6479772 6481065 her consciousness<br />onto the ship,
6481148 6482817 it's not strictly necessary.
6482900 6486821 But what matters is that<br />this is her choice.
6486904 6490199 Extracting a confused<br />or an uncertain mind will,
6490282 6491659 in all probability, kill her.
6491742 6494286 But even if it is<br />what she wants,
6494370 6498040 won't The Analyst just order<br />the Sentinels to stop you?
6498124 6499625 He will.
6499709 6502169 But if my plan works,<br />it won't matter.
6502253 6503212 Why?
6503295 6504922 Because we'll already be gone.
6506632 6508551 Somebody thinks<br />this hard about a plan,
6508634 6510052 there has to be a reason why.
6512263 6513472 When my father realized
6513556 6515808 how the Anomaleum<br />was going to be used,
6515891 6519353 he covertly transferred<br />the designs to me.
6519437 6521939 The Analyst<br />discovered his betrayal
6522023 6523899 and had my parents purged.
6526527 6529530 I would have been murdered too<br />if it wasn't for Kujaku.
6532575 6536579 Not a day goes by<br />that I don't grieve them.
6536662 6539790 I've been praying for this day<br />for a very long time.
6547882 6549425 We're coming up on broadcast.
6552011 6556015 I thought you should know<br />that I'm here because of her.
6559518 6561896 All I ever wanted was to be<br />as fearless as Trinity.
6564106 6567526 But I saw how she reacted<br />in the garage, and I...
6567610 6570237 You're wondering if I'm wrong.
6570321 6571864 What if we're too late?
6573657 6575367 What if she's not<br />Trinity anymore?
6580790 6583542 I never believed<br />I was The One.
6584418 6585836 But she did.
6586879 6588506 She believed in me.
6591175 6593385 It's my turn<br />to believe in her.
6618369 6620287 This is<br />where it gets tricky.
6631423 6633843 Have you ever done<br />an operation like this?
6634552 6635636 Not yet.
6657366 6658701 Here we go.
6676343 6678262 Welcome home.
6678345 6680723 All I want is to talk to her.
6680806 6682433 Do you mean Tiff?
6682516 6685269 Come back, and you can talk to her<br />as often as you like.
6685352 6686729 I mean, handsome Chad
6686812 6688272 may have something<br />to say about it.
6688355 6691650 If she tells me<br />this is what she wants,
6692860 6694028 you win.
6694111 6695237 Really?
6695321 6698073 But if she wants me,
6698157 6699992 then you'll let us go free.
6700075 6702828 And why would I do something<br />as stupid as that?
6702912 6705706 Right now, I'm on a ship full of people<br />who will unplug me
6705789 6708792 before they'll let you<br />take me back.
6708876 6710920 If you want this Matrix,
6711003 6712546 this is your only chance.
6712630 6715591 But how do I know<br />they won't unplug you anyway?
6715674 6719011 Same way I know you'll let us<br />walk out of here.
6744620 6746288 Okay.
6746372 6747873 I like tests.
6748749 6750542 We'll let Tiff decide.
6767893 6769061 That's it.
6770271 6771814 Bypass is ready.
6771897 6773607 Now what?
6773691 6774942 We wait.
6775025 6776986 Doesn't it seem crazy<br />to come all this way
6777069 6778654 and leave her here?
6778737 6781407 We must abide by her decision.
6781490 6783075 And if she says no,
6783909 6785369 what happens to Neo?
6785452 6786662 At this time,
6786745 6789581 the most important choice<br />of Neo's life
6789665 6791166 is not his to make.
6822197 6823991 I saw this in my dream.
6825451 6828912 If I was the Oracle,<br />maybe I could explain it.
6829580 6831165 The Oracle.
6831248 6832916 From your game?
6834793 6837046 It's not a game.
6839173 6840382 Oh, God.
6847848 6851268 After you left, I went home
6851352 6853062 and I played it.
6855439 6857900 I kept thinking,
6857983 6861320 why does this story<br />feel like a memory?
6868494 6870245 There's a part of me
6872831 6876043 that feels like I have been waiting<br />my whole life for you.
6879004 6881256 And that part is like...
6881340 6885052 What the hell<br />took you so long?
6885135 6887179 I don't have an easy answer.
6889348 6891517 Maybe I was afraid of this.
6892976 6894853 Afraid of what might happen.
6896355 6899358 Afraid of hurting<br />the only person I ever loved.
6901068 6904613 I wish I was<br />who you think I am.
6905989 6907574 But look at me.
6908867 6911036 I can't be her.
6911120 6913247 - Mom!<br />- Mom! Come on.
6913330 6914581 - Mom!<br />- It's Callie.
6914665 6915666 Is this real?
6915749 6916917 You have to come with us.
6917000 6918377 Come on, we gotta go.
6918460 6919962 Tiff, hey. Don't know<br />what's going on here,
6920045 6921380 but I'm glad we found you.
6921463 6922756 - She got hit by a car!<br />- I know, it's crazy.
6922840 6923966 She was chasing after you.
6924049 6925384 They're casting her arm.<br />We gotta go.
6925467 6926844 Doctor said<br />she's gonna be fine.
6926927 6928720 You have to come<br />with us to the hospital.
6928804 6929888 It's too late.
6929972 6931181 I understand.
6931265 6933100 - Tiff, come on, let's go.<br />- Come on.
6939606 6940691 What's happening?
6942776 6943902 Neo was wrong.
6977269 6978353 Tiffany.
6981940 6984485 Tiffany, you have<br />to come with us.
6986111 6987488 Tiffany!
6989781 6993494 I wish you would<br />fucking stop calling me that.
6993577 6995120 I hate that name.
6996622 6998165 My name is Trinity
6998248 7000626 and you better<br />take your hands off of me.
7011803 7012804 Neo!
7013305 7014306 Trinity!
7015474 7016517 Oh, shit.
7017809 7019144 Get her out. Get her out!
7027778 7031073 Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
7031156 7033825 I own that mistake.<br />Shouldn't have pressed.
7033909 7036912 Women used to be<br />so easy to control.
7036995 7041542 You know there's no way<br />I can let you two go free.
7044962 7046421 Cannot happen.
7049591 7052427 So, I guess it's deja vu<br />all over again.
7053554 7055347 She dies
7055430 7056807 and it's all your fault.
7058350 7060936 Lies, lies and more lies.
7061687 7062896 Smith?
7062980 7064106 What has the world come to
7064189 7065357 when you can't even<br />trust a program?
7065440 7068777 How...
7068860 7071613 Tom and I have more in common<br />than you know.
7071697 7074741 Once he got out,<br />let's just say,
7075576 7077369 I was free to be me.
7085043 7087796 - Yeah!<br />- Trinity?
7136178 7137346 You ready?
7137429 7138722 Yeah.
7180806 7182265 Oh, no.
7183642 7186019 Destroy her. Destroy her!
7202994 7203995 No.
7209835 7211336 Stop them.
7236987 7238488 You think this is over?
7238572 7240574 Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
7249541 7251877 Here, our unexpected<br />alliance ends.
7253545 7256173 You know the difference<br />between us, Tom?
7256256 7258133 Anyone could have been you.
7258216 7260260 Whereas I've always<br />been anyone.
7265640 7267142 What just happened?
7267225 7268393 What?
7270395 7272981 Oh, no! Move! Move!
7273064 7274107 Get the hell out of there!
7277986 7279946 - How bad?<br />- Like, all the bad.
7281239 7282699 Yeah, this is bad.
7284075 7285702 I don't suppose<br />you can still fly?
7296087 7297798 Yeah, that's not happening.
7323532 7324783 Neo! Get on.
7333458 7335252 Calliope! Take the wounded!
7335335 7337379 Everyone else,<br />we stay with them!
7354437 7356982 - How is she?<br />- Life signs are good.
7360819 7362279 Her signal's strong, Captain.
7371162 7373206 Well done, Captain.
7375584 7377460 All we need is a miracle.
7405530 7406573 I hate bots.
7412871 7414706 - Get us out of here!<br />- I'm trying!
7414789 7416791 The lockdown is tracking.<br />Swarm is everywhere.
7416875 7418043 Never seen anything like this.
7463922 7466091 Seq, what is that?
7471096 7472222 What's wrong?
7473932 7475433 What are you...
7482983 7485026 He's turning bots into bombs.
7517475 7518685 Shit!
7518768 7519769 Lexy?
7534159 7535368 Sheperd's in trouble.
7538455 7540248 Jack me in.
7540331 7542375 I can get you in.<br />I don't know if I can get you out.
7548339 7550050 No!
7563396 7564522 What are they doing?
7568568 7570236 Herding them into a kill zone.
7603311 7604646 Captain, you gotta hurry.
7604729 7606981 Hang on, Lex.
7611194 7613029 Lexy!
7655280 7656447 There they are!
7682891 7684058 Morpheus!
7687937 7689647 Lex.
7689731 7691608 - Bugsy.<br />- Hell yeah!
7692567 7694194 Seq, where's Neo?
7694277 7695904 It's bad. They're pinned.
7695987 7697071 Heading to a roof.
7766349 7767600 Nodal fibrillation<br />is critical.
7767684 7769102 She'll die<br />if we don't extract.
7810101 7812729 It's so beautiful.
7828036 7829746 I remember this.
7831831 7834042 I remember us.
7852143 7854145 My dream ended here.
7865031 7866616 We can't go back.
7868743 7869827 We won't.
7889097 7890473 Can they make the jump?
7921546 7923172 I'm not doing this.
7923256 7924632 Are you doing this?
7948739 7949824 Bye.
8030863 8032448 How dramatic.
8033282 8034575 Tiffany?
8034659 8037620 It was a private joke.
8037703 8039247 An amusement, that's all.
8039330 8041666 An amusement?
8045670 8047088 Kind of like that?
8051342 8054095 Okay.
8054178 8055638 If you hated the name so much,
8055721 8057890 why did you heel like<br />a good little bitch so long?
8061018 8063271 Yeah. Definitely asked<br />for that.
8068568 8070528 Can't you control her?
8076367 8078077 That was for using children.
8082957 8084458 We have a few questions.
8084542 8086377 You tried to activate<br />the fail-safe.
8086460 8087795 The Suits tried.
8087878 8090172 Obviously, without control<br />of your source code,
8090256 8091632 I knew that was impossible.
8091716 8093926 So, why haven't<br />the Suits purged you?
8094802 8097471 Because I know the system.
8097555 8099974 I know human beings.
8100057 8102226 And I know you.
8104645 8107189 Right now, you're feeling good<br />about what you've done.
8107273 8109692 You should.<br />It was a victory. Bravo.
8110526 8111861 Now what?
8111944 8114572 You've come here to negotiate<br />some kind of deal?
8114655 8116240 You think you hold<br />all the cards,
8116324 8118743 because you can do<br />whatever you want in this world.
8118826 8121162 I say, go for it.
8121245 8123831 Remake it.<br />Knock yourselves out.
8123914 8125958 Paint the sky with rainbows.
8126042 8127209 But here's the thing.
8127293 8130338 The sheeple aren't<br />going anywhere.
8130421 8131631 They like my world.
8131714 8134634 They don't want<br />this sentimentality.
8134717 8136636 They don't want<br />freedom or empowerment.
8136719 8139138 They want to be controlled.
8139221 8141182 They crave<br />the comfort of certainty.
8141265 8144018 And that means you two,<br />back in your pods,
8144101 8147647 unconscious and alone,<br />just like them.
8151901 8154612 We're not here<br />to negotiate anything.
8154695 8156947 We were on our way<br />to remake your world.
8157031 8158574 Change a few things.
8158658 8159867 I kind of like
8159950 8161285 the paint the sky<br />with rainbows idea.
8161369 8163287 Just remind people<br />what a free mind can do.
8163371 8164872 I forgot.<br />It's easy to forget.
8164955 8167375 - He makes it easy.<br />- That, he does.
8167458 8169669 Something he should<br />think about.
8170670 8171879 Before we got started,
8171962 8174799 we decided to stop by<br />to say thank you.
8174882 8177968 You gave us something<br />we never thought we could have.
8178052 8179428 And what is that?
8180304 8182098 Another chance.
8845344 8848138 Face reality, people.<br />Movies are dead.
8848221 8850140 Games are dead.
8850223 8851975 Narrative? Dead.
8852059 8854019 Media is nothing<br />but neuro-trigger response
8854102 8855312 and viral conditioning.
8855395 8856897 Wait, what are you two<br />talking about?
8859149 8860984 Cat videos.
8861068 8864821 What we need is<br />a series of videos
8864905 8867240 that we call The Catrix.
