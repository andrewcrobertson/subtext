141 3577 But, you know,<br />you learn a lot talking to dogs.
3745 7203 - Really, you do.<br />- Yeah, man. So...
7382 9873 Hey, man, how about this one?
11519 13248 He don't look too friendly, my friend.
13421 16117 Man, this is the one.<br />Hey, boy, how you doing?
16291 19556 Hey, what about this one here?<br />Come here, boy.
19727 21217 - Who, him?<br />- Yeah, why not?
21396 23557 Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
23731 28065 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.<br />If you look at it closely, the color...
28236 32070 ...it looks like old furniture, like some<br />kind of pirate-chest thing going on.
32240 34674 Yeah, sure, man.<br />Hey, so how about a young one?
34842 38334 Steps, forget him. Come over here.<br />I want you to see something.
38513 42882 Now, you notice what this animal<br />is doing here? Lying in that position?
43051 44279 He ain't doing nothing.
44452 47182 No, he's doing a lot.<br />He ain't wasting no energy.
47355 48515 Because he's dead.
54796 57697 He ain't dead. There's a lot of<br />good mileage left on that animal.
57865 61926 Good food, the addition of a couple<br />of new friends, bingo, he's back.
62103 65539 - What do you think is a good name?<br />- It's your dog. You name him.
65707 68301 No. It's, like,<br />a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
68476 70944 Look, I don't know much<br />about no dogs.
71112 72739 Well, it ain't that complicated.
72914 76509 You pet him, you feed him,<br />and nature takes its course.
76718 79551 You know, so...<br />Don't you wanna name an animal?
79721 83748 Every guy should at one time<br />try to name an animal something.
84258 85691 I don't know. Fleabag?
86494 90555 It's catchy. It ain't original,<br />but it's pretty good.
90732 93132 I think you could come up with,<br />in your young brain...
93301 96293 ...something better to throw out<br />than fleabag.
97138 98969 Punchy. How's that?
100475 102875 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah, Punchy.
106647 108672 - I like it, you know.<br />- For real?
108850 114083 Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to<br />remember, it's not that hard to spell.
114255 117656 And once it's in your brain, you never<br />forget it. Punchy. Very good.
117825 120487 - All right, man.<br />- Good call.
120661 123824 All right, Punchy. You ready<br />to get bailed out, my friend?
124098 125963 Okay.
127068 128933 Hey, you know<br />it was a joke, don't you?
129103 131867 Yeah, I know.<br />You're a very funny guy.
166674 168301 Rocky?
169277 171404 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
171579 173843 - Excuse me.<br />- Sure.
175450 177850 This could get ugly.
178586 180076 - Rock.<br />- Yo, Paulie.
180254 183189 They're gonna be talking about<br />that fake Looney Tune fight.
183891 186621 Hey, come on. We're about<br />to serve today's special.
186794 190252 Italian food cooked up by a bunch<br />of Mexicans ain't so special.
190431 192365 Hey, yo.
193701 195293 Hey, I skipped work for this.
199207 201801 What an ugly dog.
203044 204409 It's a cute dog.
206681 207909 - Hey, Rock.<br />- Yeah?
208082 210983 I'm gonna take off.<br />That stuff back there is pretty cool.
211185 212550 - Oh, you like that?<br />- Yeah, man.
213087 215317 - Thanks, I appreciate it.<br />- I'll catch you later.
215490 217287 All right.
221896 224091 - Who's the criminal?<br />- He's a nice kid.
224265 225926 He dresses like a bum.
226367 228927 Coming from a human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.
230404 231894 Hide the silverware.
232073 233631 That's nice.
235576 236702 Hey, Spider.
241516 243780 Didrt you knock out<br />that bum once?
243951 245919 Will you give it a rest?
256330 259629 I'm gonna be late for work for this.<br />Give me a break, huh?
259867 262631 All right. Just for a few seconds.
262803 266000 In the late '60s, a simulated fight<br />took place between two legends...
266207 268607 ...Muhammad Ali<br />and Rocky Marciano.
268776 272542 Marciano long retired,<br />and Ali unable to fight legitimately...
272713 276080 ...for three years for having refused<br />induction into the armed forces...
276250 279048 ...was in need of money,<br />and agreed to the dream match...
279220 281780 ...whose outcome would be<br />decided by a computer.
281956 284186 It' almost 35 years<br />since Rocky Marciano...
284358 286724 ...won the much-disputed<br />computer decision...
286894 289590 ...and guess what?<br />Not much has changed.
289764 291959 Last week, Rocky Balboa<br />won a decisive fight...
292133 295159 See? That's the can'toon fight<br />I'm telling you about.
295336 296803 Yeah.
296971 298438 A stunning knockout.
298606 301234 Keep in mind, this is taking<br />the human factor out of it.
301442 303239 - The computer says Balboa...<br />- Beautiful.
303411 308212 ...would be triumphant, KO 13.<br />And here' some of the fallout:
308382 310577 What started as a simple<br />form of entertainment...
310751 313049 ...has become a rallying cry<br />for people who think...
313220 315984 ...an old-school athlete like Balboa<br />could actually be better.
316157 319888 Computer technology has to create<br />what isn't. That' just not responsible.
320061 322029 Get therapy, will you?
322196 324721 How do you think Balboa<br />would have done against Dixon?
324899 328062 Badly. Personally, I think Balboa<br />was completely overrated.
328235 330066 He owns a restaurant<br />in South Philly.
330237 332205 What' the specialty,<br />pounded chicken?
332373 335831 Anyway, I would have paid to see<br />the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...
336010 337910 ...and the controversy<br />that won't go away.
338079 340479 Let' go back to Sunday' race...
340648 342309 Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.
342483 346010 It's free advertisement.<br />Come on. Meat house calls.
356030 357827 Yo, Robert.
360368 361960 What are you doing out so late?
362136 364696 I tried calling,<br />but nothing was picking up.
364872 367102 - Is something wrong?<br />- I just wanted to come by...
367274 369265 ...and see you in person.<br />- Wanna come inside?
369443 372241 No. I just wanna get<br />your opinion on something.
372880 374347 Sure. Opinion on what?
374515 376881 You know, they say you only<br />go around once, right?
377051 379281 - Yeah, I've heard that.<br />- Well...
379453 381944 ...I think I wanna, like,<br />do something.
382123 385024 - Like what?<br />- Fight.
385826 389421 You know, nothing big.<br />Small stuff, like locally. You know.
391332 394165 Don't you think you're too,<br />you know, old?
394702 396636 You think you ought to<br />stop trying things...
396804 399272 ...because you had a few<br />too many birthdays? I do not.
399440 400873 People will think you're crazy.
401042 404944 What's crazy about standing<br />toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?
405212 406736 That's just ego talking.
408282 410944 What are you trying to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
411952 414443 Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...
414622 416715 ...the way other people think<br />a long time ago.
416891 418586 You gotta think like you think.
420428 424159 - I do.<br />- Do you? Good.
424331 428893 You gotta face reality, okay?<br />It's a different world now.
429770 432136 Only the clothes is different.
434141 437133 I really don't know<br />what you want from me.
437511 442471 I just wanted us to get involved.<br />You know, like, home team.
444518 449979 Look, whatever it is, whatever<br />you're going through, it'll pass.
450191 452182 Yeah, you're probably right.
452359 454919 Time is gonna catch up to all of us.
455162 458427 - Especially if you're standing still.<br />- Hey, come on.
461302 463600 Look, I'm gonna call you<br />in the morning.
466540 469008 - Did you tell this to your kid?<br />- Yeah, I did.
469176 471337 - What'd he think, you're nuts, right?<br />- Yeah.
471512 477246 Oh, well, he don't believe in you?<br />Welcome to my world, buddy.
477418 480649 Rocko, nobody's giving you<br />no title shot.
480821 483221 I know that. I don't want one.
483390 485790 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
486961 488326 No.
488529 491521 You're mad because<br />they took down your statue?
492133 493964 No.
494802 496360 Not really, no.
496570 501667 If it's about money, just hang a sign<br />around your neck saying, "Punch me."
501842 504811 Five dollars, you'll make big money.
506514 508948 What? You haven't peaked yet?
509850 512250 - Peaked?<br />- Yeah, peaked.
512686 515177 I don't know. There's still<br />some stuff in the basement.
516257 518987 - What basement?<br />- In here.
519827 521488 Tell me about the stuff.
522797 526233 - What about it?<br />- Tell me about the stuff inside.
526400 528834 - Is it angry?<br />- Angry?
529003 531096 Are you mad because<br />Adrian left you?
531272 533866 She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
534041 535838 Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
540347 544078 You know, sometimes<br />it's hard to breathe.
544251 547982 You know, I feel, like,<br />this beast inside me.
548289 550951 It's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.
551125 554526 Is it okay?
559867 563462 I just never knew it was<br />supposed to be this hard.
563637 566606 It wasrt supposed to be like this,<br />Paulie. You know, it...
576584 578745 So you wanna come by<br />and help me train?
578919 580352 I got a job here.
580788 582346 I understand.
582790 585657 Remember you said if you stay<br />one place long enough...
585826 587157 ...you become that place?
587828 590092 Rocko, this is all I got.
590531 593056 I understand, Paulie. I do.
597638 601631 If you get time and come down<br />and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
602610 604601 Of course, Rocko.
607748 609443 Bye, Paulie.
609683 610117 Goodbye, Rocko.
610117 611744 Goodbye, Rocko.
614421 616446 Take care, Rocko.
621762 625391 This plenary session of the<br />Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...
625566 631129 ...is convened in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa...
631305 635537 ...for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing license...
635709 640510 ...due to his ineligibility to be<br />licensed as a matter of right.
640681 644640 Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself...
644818 647946 ...we invite you to make an opening<br />statement, if you'd like to.
648122 650682 No, I was just curious how I did,<br />that's all.
650858 655386 All right, well, the Medical<br />Advisory Board has informed us...
655562 658497 ...that the battery of tests<br />to which you've been subjected...
658666 661931 ...you've passed these tests<br />with flying colors.
662169 664694 And we congratulate you for that.
664872 667773 - Thanks.<br />- However, this commission...
667942 671708 ...in good conscience,<br />cannot recommend you for a license...
672112 675309 ...and we therefore deny<br />your application.
676650 679448 - Didrt I do what you asked?<br />- Yes, you did.
679620 681315 So I should get a license, right?
681655 682849 Not exactly.
685859 689386 So why did you give me all them tests<br />if you was never passing me?
689563 691531 We've gotta stand by<br />our decision here...
691699 695066 ...and we have to deny your request<br />for a license at this time.
707348 709942 Yo, don't I got some rights?
710117 712210 What rights do you think<br />you're referring to?
712386 715048 Like in that official paper<br />they wrote down the street?
715222 717156 - That's the Bill of Rights.<br />- Bill of Rights.
717324 719554 Don't it say something about going<br />after what makes you happy?
719727 722491 No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."<br />But what's your point?
722663 725928 My point is I'm pursuing something,<br />and nobody looks too happy about it.
726233 728599 But we're just looking out<br />for your interests.
728769 732432 I appreciate that, but maybe you're<br />looking out for your interests more.
732606 735939 You shouldn't ask people to come here<br />and pay the freight on something.
736110 739273 They pay, it still ain't good enough.<br />You think that's right?
739446 742711 Maybe you're doing your job, but why<br />you gotta stop me from doing mine?
743250 747118 If you're willing to go through all the<br />battling to get where you want to get...
747287 749016 ...who's got the right to stop you?
749189 752625 Maybe you got something you never<br />finished, something you wanna do.
752793 755023 Something you never said<br />to somebody, something!
755195 757322 And you're told no,<br />even after you pay your dues.
757498 760092 Who's got the right<br />to tell you that? Who? Nobody!
760267 763430 It's your right to listen to your gut.<br />It's nobody's right to say no...
763604 767005 ...after you earn the right to be what you<br />wanna be or do what you wanna do!
771245 775341 The older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.
775516 780078 The only thing I'm asking you guys<br />to leave on the table is what's right.
797504 799301 Yo! Have you seen<br />the paper today?
799473 801600 Front row. Front row.
802943 804001 That is so great.
804211 806702 - All right, all right.<br />- Let's go get some food. Food.
806880 810714 - Let's get a beer. Come on.<br />- Come on.
811185 813244 The last two pay-per-views<br />were in the toilet.
813420 816014 You're not making<br />heavyweight-championship money.
816190 818158 There's a bunch of nobodies<br />out there, Mase.
818325 821351 I wanna talk to you about an<br />opportunity we should run with.
821528 825362 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a license and got one?
825532 827432 - I heard. Forget about him.<br />- Hear me out.
827601 830968 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands tied behind my back.
831138 834505 Everybody knows you could beat him<br />sitting down. That's not what it's about.
834675 837940 It's about making money. We gotta<br />capitalize on that computer fight.
838112 840842 This could do a million buys.<br />That's 15, 20 million to you.
841014 843005 - Forget it.<br />- No one's beating the door down...
843183 845845 ...to watch you fight anymore.<br />- We got guaranteed fights.
846019 848988 You wanna do this now in front<br />of your friends, we'll do it now.
849156 852614 We got nothing. All the pay-per-view<br />fights you come up with got rejected.
852793 856320 You know why? They're all bums<br />out there. Nobody cares about them.
856730 860461 There's no marquee value.<br />But this Balboa thing is interesting.
860767 862325 - I don't wanna do it.<br />- Listen to me.
862503 866405 It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.<br />Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...
866573 869770 ...but people relate to that stuff.<br />This is a no-lose. It's all good.
870244 872838 - Good for who?<br />- For you! Not for me! For you!
873180 876115 Maybe you don't understand.<br />People don't like you no more.
876283 879741 They don't follow you. They're not<br />supporting you anymore. Understand?
879920 882047 Don't look at me like<br />I'm messing with your legacy.
882222 883951 Every jock now thinks<br />they got a legacy.
884124 887059 A legacy is what you get instead<br />of getting paid. That's a legacy.
887227 889787 - Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />- I'm not no more.
889963 893524 Everybody knows you could kick<br />this old mars ass. But you don't.
893700 895725 Leave him with a little<br />dignity, so they say:
895903 899395 "Mason Dixors got compassion.<br />He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."
899573 901973 You get a whole new audience,<br />we'll double your money.
902142 904201 You want a new image?<br />That's how you get it.
904378 906107 To replace the one<br />that you two made?
906280 909113 Whoa, wait. We made your<br />world green. You made the rest.
909283 911251 This is you.<br />You made all this junk happen.
911418 913113 I've had it up to here with this mess.
913287 915778 Time for me to make changes.<br />I'm going to Martirs gym.
915956 917685 - We'll talk about it.<br />- Forget this crap.
917858 920224 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.
930938 932701 - How you doing?<br />- Hey, what a surprise.
932873 935273 I was driving around<br />the neighborhood, I thought...
935442 938070 ...why not drive by and say hello?<br />- You wanna come inside?
938245 941271 No, the dog needs some exercise.<br />You wanna take a little walk?
941448 943848 - Yeah, yeah. All right.<br />- It's nice outside.
944017 946577 - All right.<br />- Nice and brisk.
946753 947947 When did you get a dog?
948121 950214 We picked up Punchy<br />a couple of days back.
950390 951584 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah.
951758 952986 You named your dog Punchy?
953160 954855 Your kid come up with the name.
955028 957462 Oh, yeah?<br />I think that's disrespectful.
957631 959394 Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.
959566 962865 No, it's easy to remember<br />and it's all that, you know.
963036 966028 Listen, what do you think about<br />coming over to the restaurant?
966206 969232 - What for?<br />- Well, you know, for, like...
969409 972845 for work. The hostess is gonna<br />be having a kid. You'd do good.
973013 975538 - I don't know.<br />- I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
975716 978184 I appreciate what you're doing<br />for my kid, but I can't.
978352 980820 Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.
980988 983422 It's a nice environment,<br />it's very pleasant.
983590 985649 Yeah, can we drop it?
988128 989618 What's bothering you?
989796 992026 Nothing. It's all right.<br />Listen, I gotta get back.
993467 995401 - No, it ain't all right.<br />- Oh, come on.
995736 997601 - What?<br />- I'm gonna be the first person...
997771 1000205 ...people see when they walk in?<br />- You give out menus.
1000374 1003138 You say, "Hello, how are you?"<br />You sit people down.
1003310 1005574 Look, if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.
1005746 1009011 You could find 10 better people,<br />a hundred better people for this job.
1009182 1011013 Give it a try, like two weeks.
1011184 1012981 I don't wanna try.
1013153 1015383 - Who put this stuff in your head?<br />- Nobody.
1015555 1017546 Well, it just don't<br />get in there by itself.
1021128 1023062 Thanks for coming by.
1024965 1029459 Yo, when was the last time you<br />went dancing? Has it been a while?
1029636 1031501 - Why are you asking?<br />- I'm asking because...
1031672 1034937 ...you dance around these problems,<br />you might as well dance with me.
1035108 1038134 I ain't that good,<br />but I'm better than the average bear.
1038312 1040974 Where that came from, I don't know.
1041615 1043082 - You're crazy.<br />- A little bit.
1043250 1046515 But the way you're thinking<br />and talking, it's a little crazy too.
1047387 1051016 Come on, you deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
1051191 1055423 I need you to class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
1055796 1059459 And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"<br />again, I totally understand.
1059633 1062067 But I'm warning you,<br />I'm gonna put myself...
1062235 1064100 ...in the middle of the street here...
1064271 1067206 ...and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />and wave to the first bus, say:
1067374 1069103 "Come on over here and mash me!
1069276 1071744 Little Marie turned down<br />the job at the restaurant.
1071912 1073607 She thinks she's better than us."
1073780 1077045 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
1077684 1079675 - Yeah?<br />- No.
1081755 1083382 That was a close call.
1084458 1089452 Listen, seriously. Come on over.<br />It'd be nice.
1092099 1093532 All right.
1111785 1113343 Paulie!
1116690 1118487 Sorry, Paulie.
1119893 1121588 Sorry.
1152859 1155987 How are you?<br />Get my unusual up there.
1156163 1158927 Excuse me.<br />Deliveries are in the back.
1159099 1160794 I'm not a delivery guy.
1160967 1162764 Well, do you have a reservation?
1162936 1165666 Do I look like a freaking Indian?
1168642 1170940 Hey, Rock? Rocky?
1175849 1178613 I think we've got a little bit<br />of a problem with this guy.
1178785 1181117 Problem?<br />No, no, he's just a relative.
1181288 1183552 Oh, okay.
1186092 1187525 Yo, Paulie.
1189796 1191787 - What happened to your eye?<br />- I hit it.
1192098 1193895 - Why?<br />- Needed to.
1194534 1195865 What happened?
1196036 1198766 - I'm celebrating, Rock.<br />- Why?
1198939 1201373 - I retired.<br />- Retired?
1207214 1209808 So when did they start<br />giving retired people meat...
1209983 1212144 ...instead of watches, Paulie?
1214955 1216923 I don't need a watch.
1218758 1222159 I got a watch! You gave me a watch!
1222362 1223624 Paulie...
1223797 1226322 I don't need no goddamn watch.
1227968 1231096 - Yo, Paulie.<br />- I got a watch!
1232405 1234396 I got two watches!
1234875 1237036 Yo, Paulie!
1249389 1250413 Yo, Paulie.
1252058 1253548 Rock.
1253860 1258263 It takes guts climbing back in that ring,<br />knowing you're gonna take a beating.
1260967 1262867 You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
1263136 1264467 How do you know that?
1266373 1268933 The stuff in the basement.
1279920 1281649 Thanks, Paulie.
1286459 1289360 - Hey.<br />- Hey, Rock, how are you?
1290730 1292857 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, good. How are you?
1293033 1294660 - Yeah, fine. This is great.<br />- Good.
1294834 1297496 Listen, some guys over there<br />wanna talk to you.
1297671 1300469 - Okay. You got it.<br />- Okay?
1303910 1306606 - Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.<br />- Our pleasure.
1306780 1308771 - Wanna hear stories?<br />- What kind of stories?
1308982 1311678 Well, a lot of people like to hear<br />these old fight stories.
1311851 1313318 - Maybe later.<br />- Okay.
1313486 1317946 I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixors manager.
1318158 1320558 - Will you sit down and join us?<br />- Sure.
1322128 1324926 You know, we have the promotional<br />contract for Mason Dixon...
1325098 1326622 ...who's a big fan.<br />- Really?
1326800 1328927 When he heard you were<br />interested in fighting...
1329102 1331332 ...he thought why not try<br />to work something out?
1331504 1334530 Like a special event.<br />Like a first-class exhibition fight.
1336076 1338169 - Why me?<br />- He respects the hell out of you.
1338345 1342304 All right? And let's be honest,<br />that computer fight got people curious.
1342482 1344916 - This could be very interesting.<br />- I ain't interested...
1345085 1347212 ...in getting, like,<br />mangled and embarrassed.
1347387 1349548 No, that's not gonna happen.<br />Never happen.
1349723 1353887 Truthfully, I was thinking<br />more on a, like...
1354294 1357889 ...miniscule, small level.<br />You know. Small fights, not big fights.
1358164 1362100 Small fights. Things that...<br />Local. You know what I mean?
1362268 1365795 Not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big.<br />Think of it like an exhibition.
1365972 1369533 Think of it as a glorified sparring<br />session. Here's something you'll like.
1369709 1372234 We're gonna donate a portion<br />of the gate to charity.
1372412 1374505 - That's always nice.<br />- It's good to give.
1374681 1376148 Yeah.
1376583 1378175 Where's it taking place?
1378351 1379716 - Las Vegas.<br />- Las Vegas.
1379886 1383117 Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killing you.
1383323 1385689 - Little stiff.<br />- You move better when you're warmer.
1386292 1387919 - Yeah.<br />- And if nothing else...
1388094 1390187 ...you'll have new stories to tell.
1390463 1393296 - I really gotta think about this.<br />- Absolutely.
1393466 1395866 - Is that okay?<br />- I understand. No problem.
1396236 1398431 I'm gonna go over there.<br />You can order something.
1398605 1400698 - What do you recommend?<br />- It's all edible.
1403610 1406204 Okay. Thanks.
1406813 1410647 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime?
1410817 1413285 - He'd kill him. Kill him.<br />- You ain't kidding.
1413820 1416186 Man, I'm confused.
1423396 1425296 I didn't think this was gonna<br />come along.
1425465 1427092 But this is what you wanted, right?
1427267 1429565 I don't know.<br />You know, I talk and I talk.
1429736 1431829 Sometimes I think<br />what I'm saying is true...
1432005 1436339 ...and then I look at myself and I'm<br />not even sure what is true anymore.
1436509 1439501 Because it's like, I pushed<br />this crazy idea about fighting.
1439679 1441237 I mean, what's it all about?
1441414 1444349 Do I really care about standing<br />toe to toe and all that stuff...
1444517 1448112 ...or, like my kid says,<br />is it just, like, ego?
1448288 1452054 Or am I this old pug who's just trying<br />to replace old pain with new pain?
1452225 1454819 I don't know. I don't know.
1456596 1459360 Look, I know<br />I usually don't say a lot.
1459532 1463593 I'm always listening and looking.
1463770 1468707 But who you are, the part of you<br />that's so full of life...
1468875 1470934 ...we all have that feeling, that fire...
1471111 1475605 ...but usually never get a chance<br />to use it. And then it just goes away.
1475782 1480719 But you can. You've got this<br />opportunity, so do it. Why not?
1480887 1485187 I mean, this is who you are.<br />This is who you'll always be.
1485358 1488657 And you don't move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.
1488828 1491626 And it doesn't matter<br />how this looks to other people.
1491798 1494096 All that matters<br />is how it looks to you.
1496269 1497793 Rocky.
1499005 1500996 Rocky, look at me.
1502108 1505544 How it looks to you.
1506546 1508537 And if this is something<br />that you wanna do...
1508715 1512742 ...and if this is something that<br />you gotta do, then you do it.
1514154 1515815 Fighters fight.
1519559 1521993 You're not gonna punch me,<br />are you?
1525598 1529227 Listen, I gotta go before I wear out<br />my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
1530703 1532000 Thanks.
1542849 1545147 Fighters fight, right?
1551391 1555350 It's rare when you get to promote<br />an event bigger than boxing. This is.
1555528 1559294 Skill versus will, with part<br />of the proceeds going to charity.
1559465 1563663 The brainchild of Mason Dixon,<br />to honor past heavyweight champions.
1563837 1567068 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
1567240 1568434 Hey, champ!
1568608 1572601 A few great fighters have fought in<br />their 50s, often with disastrous results.
1572779 1574440 Why risk the danger<br />and embarrassment?
1574614 1577048 The smart money says<br />you have virtually no chance.
1577217 1581278 A puncher always has a chance.<br />This fight will be competitive.
1582722 1584713 Why are you doing this, Rocky?
1584891 1589055 I don't know, I'd rather do<br />something I love badly than...
1589229 1593825 Than to feel bad by not<br />doing something you love.
1594601 1597263 Rocky, the press has labeled you<br />a Balboasaurus.
1599138 1600799 How do you feel about that?
1600974 1604933 Let's say the following happens:<br />You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
1605111 1608603 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
1608781 1612182 You all know that will never happen.<br />This is only an exhibition.
1612352 1615788 Don't go trying to make more out<br />of this than that computer tried.
1617657 1621252 Isn't this sport in enough trouble<br />without these circus events?
1621561 1623859 - Next question.<br />- On the surface, this looks like...
1624030 1626430 ...a cheap bit of ring theater<br />between, no offense...
1626599 1629124 ...a has-been and a man<br />whose own credible legacy...
1629302 1630792 ...and popularity is in doubt.
1630970 1632597 - What's the upside?<br />- Doubt?
1632772 1635297 Upside? I mean...
1635475 1639138 What do you mean, upside?<br />I mean, what do I have to do?
1640380 1642644 You know, I'm 33-0<br />with 30 knockouts.
1642916 1645851 I'm doing you people a favor.<br />I'm having this exhibition for you.
1646019 1649011 You gonna get up here and make<br />a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.
1649689 1651850 I mean, I get pissed,<br />this guy get hurt.
1652792 1654453 See you at the fight.
1658564 1660828 The guy's a joke.<br />He's gonna get crushed.
1670576 1672305 - Look who's here.<br />- How you doing?
1672478 1674742 - Have you seen my father?<br />- He's in the back.
1674914 1677747 This place has never served<br />this many meals. It's unbelievable.
1677917 1682013 You're doing good? Hope you're<br />enjoying everything, all right?
1684257 1685781 Excuse me.
1687460 1691021 How you doing? Glad you come by.
1691597 1692723 Can I talk with you?
1693032 1695523 - Sure.<br />- Can we do it outside?
1700373 1703206 - So you're going through with this?<br />- I start training tomorrow.
1703376 1706607 Hey, Rock.<br />I made some connections.
1706779 1709145 I can make some money<br />on this, endorsements.
1710316 1711510 Absolutely. Do that.
1711918 1714352 - Thank you, Rock. Okay.<br />- Sure.
1715054 1718455 - So you nervous about the fight?<br />- Scared to death.
1718624 1721354 - You don't look scared.<br />- Well, I ain't supposed to.
1721527 1723927 Then you don't have to do it.
1724097 1726395 Yeah, well, I think I do.
1729502 1732665 You know, living with you,<br />it hasn't been easy.
1732839 1735467 People see me<br />but they think of you.
1735641 1738474 Now with all this going on,<br />it's gonna be worse than ever.
1738644 1740578 - It don't have to be.<br />- Sure it does!
1740747 1743477 - Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.<br />- What, my last name?
1743649 1745583 That's the reason I got a decent job.
1745752 1747947 That's why people deal with me<br />in the first place.
1748121 1749782 Now I start to get a little ahead...
1749956 1753892 ...I start to get a little something<br />for myself, and this happens.
1754060 1757325 Now, I'm asking you as a favor<br />not to go through with this.
1757497 1760660 This is gonna end up bad for you,<br />and it's gonna end up bad for me.
1760833 1763563 - You think I'm hurting you?<br />- Yeah. In a way, you are.
1763903 1765768 That's the last thing<br />I ever wanted to do.
1765938 1769374 I know that's not what you wanna do,<br />but that's just the way that it is.
1769542 1772636 Don't you care what people think?<br />Doesrt it bother you that people...
1772812 1775872 ...are making you out to be a joke<br />and that I'll be included in that?
1776049 1779075 Do you think that's right? Do you?
1785091 1790028 You ain't gonna believe this,<br />but you used to fit right here.
1790196 1792426 I'd hold you up<br />and say to your mother:
1792598 1795158 "This kid is gonna be<br />the best kid in the world.
1795334 1798565 This kid is gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew."
1798738 1801571 And you grew up<br />good and wonderful.
1801741 1804869 It was great just watching,<br />every day was like a privilege.
1805044 1808241 Then the time come for you to be<br />your own man and take on the world...
1808414 1812942 ...and you did. But somewhere<br />along the line, you changed.
1813119 1814381 You stopped being you.
1814554 1817853 You let people stick a finger in<br />your face and tell you you're no good.
1818024 1821687 And when things got hard, you started<br />looking for something to blame...
1821861 1823954 ...like a big shadow.
1825431 1827695 Let me tell you something<br />you already know.
1827867 1830199 The world ain't all<br />sunshine and rainbows.
1830369 1834203 It's a very mean and nasty place,<br />and I don't care how tough you are...
1834373 1837968 ...it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there if you let it.
1838611 1842604 You, me or nobody<br />is gonna hit as hard as life.
1842782 1846912 But it ain't about how hard you hit.<br />It's about how hard you can get hit...
1847086 1848485 ...and keep moving forward.
1848654 1851851 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
1852024 1854424 That's how winning is done!
1854894 1857624 If you know what you're won'th,<br />go and get what you're won'th.
1857797 1861062 But you gotta be willing to take<br />the hits, and not pointing fingers...
1861234 1865330 ...saying you ain't where you wanna be<br />because of him or her or anybody!
1865505 1869737 Cowards do that, and that ain't you!<br />You're better than that!
1876482 1879815 I'm always gonna love you<br />no matter what.
1879986 1881851 No matter what happens.
1882221 1885019 You're my son and you're my blood.
1885191 1887955 You're the best thing in my life.
1889195 1893063 But until you start believing in<br />yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.
1897904 1900395 Don't forget to visit your mother.
1950289 1952917 - Yeah, those are beautiful.<br />- Yeah.
1954860 1957954 - You get off early from work?<br />- No.
1958397 1959887 I left.
1960533 1962057 I quit.
1962835 1964132 Quit, why?
1965538 1967904 I wasrt very...
1968541 1971669 I don't know, I just...<br />I didn't fit in there.
1973713 1975146 I understand.
1979819 1983084 - So, what are you gonna do?<br />- Right now?
1984590 1987184 Right now I'd rather be with you.
1989528 1991325 Is that all right?
1992665 1994462 Yeah.
1994800 1997633 It's been a long time<br />since I seen a fight.
2009482 2009548 You know all there is<br />to know about fighting...
2009548 2011709 You know all there is<br />to know about fighting...
2011884 2015047 ...so there's no sense us going down<br />that same old road again.
