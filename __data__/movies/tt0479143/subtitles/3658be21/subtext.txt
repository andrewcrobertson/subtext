414748 416817 A few of the guys<br />getting together...
416884 418151 Did I do somethin' wrong?
418218 419687 What do you mean?
419753 423156 Well, I don't know exactly<br />what I mean, but...
423223 427294 I just think that<br />when I come here,<br />you don't feel so comfortable.
427360 429029 And I certainly<br />don't wanna do that.
430598 432833 Well, you throw a big shadow.
432900 436470 -A big shadow?<br />-You're not gonna get anything<br />done down here, Robert.

442843 444745 It's a good job.
444812 447915 I've told Robert<br />about twenty times<br />that I wanted to meet you.
447981 449382 But I guess<br />you're pretty busy,

464565 467100 Finally, we meet.<br />Well, I have to go.
467167 469002 It was nice to<br />meet you face to face.

1336536 1337637 Yeah.
1339772 1341908 We moved in about a year ago.
1342709 1344110 It's only temporary.
1344176 1345578 I could see that.
1345645 1347380 I'm gonna look<br />for an apartment.

1356789 1357857 Yeah.
1357924 1360026 Down the street is<br />the Cambria Fight Club.
1360092 1362128 They used to call it<br />the Bucket of Blood.
1362194 1363696 I took some<br />massive beatings there.
1363763 1365331 But it was nice.<br />Good memories.
1365398 1370837 And I heard these buildings<br />are 100, 150 years old...
1370903 1373440 If I was 150 years old,<br />I'd be fallin' apart, too.
1373506 1375675 So it's okay, building.
1375742 1377143 Does that light work?
1377209 1379612 Nah,<br />it's burnt out or somethin'.

1429028 1430229 Short for Stevenson.
1430296 1431430 Makes sense.
1434867 1438471 Does he look mad at me,<br />or is it maybe<br />the angle I'm standin' at?
1438538 1440907 -No. He's a good kid.<br />-Oh.
1440973 1442441 You wanna meet him?

1998497 2001133 Hell, no. That's one ugly dog.
2001200 2003001 I know,<br />but it's kind of a cute ugly.
2003069 2005571 If you look at it closely,<br />the color,
2005637 2009575 it looks like old furniture,<br />like some kinda pirate<br />chest thing going on.
2009641 2012144 Yeah, sure.<br />Hey, how about a young one?
2012211 2015781 Steps, forget him. Come here.<br />I want you to see something.
2015847 2020119 Notice what this<br />animal is doin' here?<br />Lyin' in that position?
2020186 2021753 He ain't doin' nothin'.
2021820 2024356 No, he's doin' a lot.<br />He ain't wastin' no energy.
2024423 2025657 Because he's dead.
2032231 2035434 He ain't dead. There's a lot<br />of good mileage<br />left on that animal.
2035501 2039438 Some good food,<br />a couple of new friends,<br />bingo, he's back.
2039505 2040939 What do you<br />think is a good name?
2041006 2042908 It's your dog. You name him.
2042974 2045611 No. It's a community animal.<br />Fifty-fifty.
2045677 2048380 Look, I don't know<br />much about no dogs.
2048447 2050549 Well, you know,<br />it ain't that complicated.
2050616 2055521 You pet him, you feed him<br />and nature takes its course.
2055587 2057223 Don't you wanna<br />name an animal?
2057289 2060892 Every guy should<br />at one time try<br />to name an animal something.
2061560 2063829 I don't know. Fleabag?
2063895 2068134 It's catchy.<br />It ain't original,<br />but it's pretty good. Uh...
2068200 2070436 I think, though,<br />you could come up with,<br />in your young brain,
2070502 2073172 something better to throw out<br />than Fleabag.
2074340 2076142 Punchy. How's that?
2077676 2079478 -Punchy?<br />-Yeah, Punchy.
2083249 2084550 I like it.
2084616 2085951 For real?
2086017 2087786 For real.<br />Punchy it is.
2087853 2091257 It's easy to remember,<br />it's not that hard to spell
2091323 2093525 and once it's in your brain,<br />you never forget it.
2093592 2094760 Punchy. Very good.
2094826 2095894 Alright.
2095961 2097896 Good call.
2097963 2102168 Alright, Punchy! You ready<br />to be bailed out, my friend?<br />Okay!
2103502 2106272 Hey, you know it<br />was a joke, don't you?
2106338 2108974 -Yeah, I know.<br />You're a very funny guy.<br />-(LAUGHING)

2200165 2201367 He's a nice kid.
2201433 2203134 He dresses like a bum.
2203201 2205771 Oh! Coming from a<br />human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.

2341940 2343442 Is something wrong?
2343509 2345577 No. I just wanted to come by<br />and see you in person.
2345644 2346945 You wanna come inside?
2347012 2349314 No. I just wanna get<br />your opinion on somethin'.
2350048 2351783 Sure. On what?
2351850 2354052 They say you only go<br />around once, right?
2354119 2355587 I've heard that.
2355654 2358323 Well,<br />I think I wanna do somethin'.
2358924 2360091 Like what?
2360158 2361226 Fight.
2363094 2365797 Nothing big.<br />Small stuff, like locally...
2368767 2371970 Don't you think<br />you're too, you know, old?
2372037 2374105 Think you should<br />stop tryin' things
2374172 2376442 'cause you had a few<br />too many birthdays? I do not.
2376508 2378076 People are gonna<br />think you're going crazy.
2378143 2382548 What's crazy about standing<br />toe-to-toe saying "I am"?
2382614 2385316 That's just the ego talking.
2385383 2389254 What are you trying to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
2389320 2392257 Prove? Listen,<br />I stopped thinkin' the way
2392323 2394125 other people<br />think a long time ago.
2394192 2395761 You gotta think<br />like you think.
2397596 2398830 I do.

2458223 2460526 I know that. I don't want one.
2460592 2462928 So this isn't<br />a mental disturbance?
2464162 2465897 No.
2465964 2468767 You're mad because they took<br />down your statue?
2469200 2470636 No...
2470702 2472170 (LAUGHING)
2472237 2473805 Not really.

2486484 2487653 Peaked?
2488219 2489888 Yeah, peaked.
2489955 2492390 I don't know.<br />There's still some<br />stuff in the basement.
2493024 2494526 What basement?
2494593 2495827 In here.
2497195 2498630 Tell me about the stuff.
2500098 2501366 What about it?
2501432 2504502 Tell me about<br />the stuff inside. Is it angry?
2505236 2506705 Angry?
2506772 2508607 Are you mad<br />because Adrian left you?
2508674 2511076 She didn't leave, Paulie.<br />She died.

2525757 2528393 It's okay, Rocko. It's okay.
2528459 2530962 Is it okay?
2537235 2540972 I just never knew<br />it was supposed<br />to be this hard.
2541039 2543642 It wasn't<br />supposed to be like this.<br />You know it.

2556021 2557789 I got a job here.
2557856 2560125 I understand.
2560191 2562694 Remember you said if you stay<br />one place long enough
2562761 2564162 you become that place?
2565230 2567032 This is all I've got.
2567899 2569534 I understand.
2573138 2574973 (EXHALES)
2575040 2578877 If you get time and come down<br />and see me train,<br />I'd appreciate it.
2580011 2581346 Of course.

2599197 2601332 MALE COMMISSIONER 1: <i>This</i><br /><i>plenary session</i><br /><i>of the Pennsylvania</i>
2601399 2604035 <i>Athletic</i><br /><i>Commission is convened</i>
2604102 2608606 <i>in order to consider</i><br /><i>the application</i><br /><i>of Rocky Balboa</i>
2608674 2613111 for the issuance<br />of a discretionary<br />professional boxing license
2613178 2617883 due to his ineligibility<br />to be licensed as<br />a matter of right.
2617949 2619885 Mr. Balboa,<br />you are welcome here.
2619951 2621853 Since you're<br />representing yourself,
2621920 2625356 we invite you to make<br />an opening statement,<br />if you'd like to.
2625423 2628159 I was just curious<br />about how I did, that's all.
2628226 2632698 Alright, well. The Medical<br />Advisory Board has informed us
2632764 2635734 that the battery of tests<br />to which you've<br />been subjected,
2635801 2639370 you've passed these tests<br />with flying colors.
2639437 2641907 And we<br />congratulate you for that.
2641973 2643709 -Thanks.<br />-However,
2643775 2646211 this commission,<br />in good conscience,
2646277 2649414 cannot recommend<br />you for a license,
2649480 2652183 and we therefore<br />deny your application.
2654119 2655687 Didn't I do what you asked?
2655754 2656755 Yes, you did.
2656822 2658857 So I should get a license,<br />right?
2658924 2660091 Not exactly.
2663128 2666865 So why did you<br />give me all them tests<br />if you was never passing me?
2666932 2669600 We've got to stand<br />by our decision and
2669667 2672270 deny your request for<br />a license at this time.
2684649 2687385 Don't I got some rights?
2687452 2689721 MALE COMMISSIONER 1: What<br />rights do you think<br />you're referring to?
2689788 2691022 Rights,<br />like in that official paper
2691089 2692257 they wrote down<br />the street there?
2692323 2693825 That's the Bill of Rights.
2693892 2695827 Yeah, the Bill of Rights.
2695894 2697328 Don't it say somethin' about<br />goin' after what<br />makes you happy?
2697395 2699965 No, that's "the<br />pursuit of happiness".<br />But what is your point?
2700031 2701332 My point is I'm<br />pursuing something,
2701399 2703501 and nobody looks<br />too happy about it.
2703568 2705737 But we're just looking<br />after your interests.
2705804 2707305 I appreciate that,<br />but maybe you're looking
2707372 2709941 out for your<br />interests a little bit more.
2710008 2711810 You shouldn't be asking people
2711877 2713745 to come down here<br />and pay<br />the freight on something.
2713812 2716782 They pay.<br />They still ain't good enough.<br />You think that's right?
2716848 2718316 Maybe you're doing<br />your job, but why
2718383 2720651 do you gotta stop<br />me from doing mine?
2720718 2722087 Because if you're<br />willing to go through all
2722153 2724555 the battling to get<br />where you want to get,
2724622 2726524 who's got<br />the right to stop you?
2726591 2729160 Maybe you have something<br />you never finished,
2729227 2730361 something you<br />really want to do
2730428 2732530 something you<br />never said to somebody,<br />something!
2732597 2734699 And you're told no,<br />even after you pay your dues.
2734766 2737568 Who's got the right<br />to tell you that? Nobody!
2737635 2739104 It's your right to<br />listen to your gut.
2739170 2740839 It ain't nobody's<br />right to say no,
2740906 2742107 after you earn<br />the right to be what
2742173 2743741 you want to be or do<br />what you want to do!
2748646 2750115 The older I get,<br />the more things
2750181 2752851 I gotta leave behind.<br />That's life.
2752918 2757088 The only thing I'm asking you<br />to leave on<br />the table is what's right.
2774705 2776842 Have you seen the paper today?
2776908 2779310 Front row. Front row.
2779377 2781012 That is so great.
2782180 2784682 Let's go get some food.<br />Food...
2784749 2786284 Come on. Come on!
2788553 2790721 The last two pay-per-views<br />were in the toilet.
2790788 2792123 Nobody cares.<br />You're not makin'
2792190 2793859 heavyweight<br />championship money.
2793925 2795626 There's a bunch of<br />nobodies out there,<br />Mace. This is the bottom line.
2795693 2797162 But I wanna talk to<br />you about somethin'
2797228 2798864 I think is<br />an interesting opportunity<br />we should run with.
2798930 2800665 Look at me!<br />You heard Rocky Balboa
2800731 2802333 applied for<br />a license and got one?
2802400 2804135 Yeah, I heard.<br />Forget about him...
2804202 2805470 -No, hear me out.<br />-Hear what out?
2805536 2807005 You want me to<br />fight a guy I can beat
2807072 2808473 with both hands<br />tied behind my back?
2808539 2810541 Everybody knows you could<br />beat the guy sitting down.
2810608 2812077 But that's not<br />what it's about.
2812143 2815346 It's about makin' money.<br />We gotta capitalize<br />on that computer fight.
2815413 2816714 This thing could<br />do a million buys.
2816781 2818083 That's fifteen,<br />twenty million to you.
2818149 2819885 -Forget about it.<br />-Then what do you wanna do?
2819951 2821386 Because no one is<br />beating the door down<br />to watch you fight any more.
2821452 2822988 Look, man, we've got<br />guaranteed fights...
2823054 2824890 No, we don't.<br />You wanna do this right now
2824956 2826724 in front of your friends,<br />we'll do it now.
2826791 2830061 We got nothin'.<br />All the pay-per-view fights<br />you came up with got rejected.
2830128 2833731 You know why?<br />They're all bums out there.<br />Nobody cares about them.
2833798 2838036 There's no marquee value.<br />But this Balboa<br />thing is interesting.
2838103 2839704 -I don't wanna do it...<br />-Listen to me.
2839770 2841639 It's a has-been,<br />never-gonna-be world.
2841706 2843574 Call it nostalgia<br />or whatever you want,
2843641 2845743 but people can<br />relate to that stuff.
2845810 2847712 This is<br />a no-lose for everybody.<br />It's all good.
2847778 2850048 -Good for who?<br />-For you! Not for me!
2850115 2853618 Maybe you don't understand.<br />People don't<br />like you any more.
2853684 2855753 They don't follow you.<br />They're not supporting<br />you any more.
2855820 2857355 Understand?
2857422 2859290 Don't look at me like<br />I'm messing with your legacy.
2859357 2861326 Every jock now thinks<br />they've got a legacy.
2861392 2862994 A legacy is what<br />you get instead
2863061 2864295 of getting paid.<br />That's a legacy.
2864362 2865663 Don't talk to me<br />like I'm stupid.
2865730 2866998 I'm not no more.
2867065 2868733 PROMOTER: Mason. Everybody<br />knows you could kick
2868799 2870635 this old man's ass.<br />But you don't.
2870701 2873171 You leave him with<br />a little bit of dignity,<br />so they say,
2873238 2876841 "Mason Dixon's got compassion.<br />He's a decent guy,<br />a nice guy."
2876908 2878276 You'll get<br />a whole new audience,
2878343 2879410 we'll double your<br />money on the next fight.
2879477 2881412 You want a new image?<br />That's how you get it.
2881479 2883081 What you mean?<br />To replace the one<br />that you two made?
2883148 2885250 -(SCOFFS)<br />-Whoa, wait. We made your<br />world green.
2885316 2886417 You made the rest.
2886484 2888486 You made all this junk happen.
2888553 2890421 I've had it up to<br />here with this mess, man.
2890488 2891789 It's time for me to<br />make some changes.
2891856 2893391 I'm goin' back<br />to Martin's gym.
2893458 2894792 Alright,<br />we'll talk about this crap.
2894859 2896794 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothin' to talk about.
2908206 2910141 -How you doin'?<br />-Hey, what a surprise.
2910208 2912210 I was just drivin'<br />around the neighborhood<br />and I thought,
2912277 2915280 -"Why not drive<br />by and say hello."<br />-You wanna come inside?
2915346 2918683 No, the dog needs<br />some exercise.<br />You wanna take a little walk?
2918749 2919784 Uh... Yeah. Alright.
2919850 2920986 It's nice outside.
2921052 2922520 Alright.
2922587 2924122 Nice and brisk.
2924189 2925390 When did you get a dog?
2925456 2927425 Uh... We picked up Punchy<br />a couple of days ago.
2927492 2928826 -Punchy?<br />-Yeah.
2928893 2930395 You named your dog Punchy?
2930461 2932397 Actually, your kid<br />came up with the name.
2932463 2934865 Oh, yeah?<br />I think that's disrespectful.
2934932 2940238 Oh, no. It's fine. Really.<br />It's easy to<br />remember and all that.
2940305 2943474 Listen, what do you think<br />about coming over<br />to the restaurant?
2943541 2947212 -What for?<br />-You know, for work.
2947278 2949981 The hostess is<br />gonna be havin' a kid.<br />You'd do good.
2950048 2951282 I don't know...
2951349 2953151 I'm telling you,<br />you'd do so good.
2953218 2955620 I appreciate what you're doing<br />for my kid, but I can't.
2955686 2958356 You know,<br />I think you'd like it a lot.
2958423 2961026 It's a nice environment,<br />it's very pleasant...
2961092 2962627 Can we drop it?
2965296 2967098 What's bothering you?
2967165 2969234 Nothing. It's alright.<br />Listen, I gotta get back.
2970635 2972537 -Naw, it ain't alright.<br />-Oh, come on.
2972603 2974239 What?
2974305 2976207 I'm supposed to<br />be the first person<br />people see when they walk in?
2976274 2980511 You just give out menus,<br />say "Hello, how are you",<br />sit people down,
2980578 2982813 Look, Little Marie,<br />if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.
2982880 2984249 You could find<br />ten better people,
2984315 2986451 a hundred better<br />people for this job.
2986517 2988153 Give it a try, like two weeks.
2988219 2989320 I don't wanna try.
2990555 2992123 Who put this<br />stuff in your head?
2992190 2993358 Nobody.
2993424 2994792 Well, it don't get<br />in there by itself.
2998263 3000065 Thanks for comin' by.
3002233 3006337 Yo! When was the last time<br />you went dancing?<br />Has it been a while?
3006404 3008106 Why are you asking me that?
3008173 3010241 I'm asking<br />because you're dancing<br />around all these problems,
3010308 3011676 you might as well come<br />and dance with me.
3011742 3013178 Now, I ain't that good,
3013244 3015613 but I'm probably better than<br />the average bear.
3015680 3016947 Where that came from,<br />I don't know.
3018483 3019717 You're crazy.
3019784 3021619 A little bit.<br />But the way you're thinkin'
3021686 3024789 and talkin',<br />it's a little crazy, too.
3024855 3028493 Come on. You deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
3028559 3031396 I need you to<br />class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
3033164 3036701 And if you say<br />"Screw you, creepo" again,<br />I totally understand.
3036767 3039036 But I'm warnin' you,<br />I'm gonna put myself
3039104 3041306 geographically in<br />the middle of the street
3041372 3044909 and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />and wave to<br />the first bus, and say
3044975 3046744 "Come on over<br />here and mash me!
3046811 3049147 "Because Little<br />Marie turned down<br />the job at the restaurant."
3049214 3051649 "She thinks she's<br />better than us."
3051716 3052917 Oh, yeah?<br />Well, there hasn't been
3052983 3054185 a bus down here<br />in twenty years.
3055019 3056654 -Yeah?<br />-No.
3057888 3058923 Whew.
3058989 3061726 That was a close call.
3061792 3066131 Listen, seriously.<br />Come on over.<br />It would be nice.
3069467 3070701 Alright.
3089154 3090221 FOREMAN: Paulie!

3130094 3133298 How are you?<br />Get my unusual up there.
3133364 3136434 Excuse me.<br />Deliveries are in the back.
3136501 3138303 I'm not a delivery guy.
3138369 3140271 Do you have a reservation?
3140338 3142072 Do I look like<br />a freakin' Indian?
3142139 3143474 (LAUGHING)
3146143 3147345 Hey, Rocky?
3150748 3153017 (SIGHS)
3153083 3156086 I think we've got a little bit<br />of a problem with this guy.
3156153 3158589 Problem?<br />No, he's just a relative.
3158656 3159990 Oh. Okay.
3163528 3164662 Yo, Paulie?
3167131 3168266 What happened to your eye?
3168333 3169434 I hit it.
3169500 3171001 -Why?<br />-Needed to.
3171902 3173371 What happened?
3173438 3175406 -I'm celebrating.<br />-Why?
3176374 3177708 I retired.
3177775 3178943 Retired?
3179009 3180010 (LAUGHS)
3184682 3188453 When did they start<br />giving retired people<br />meat instead of watches?
3192423 3193691 I don't need a watch.
3195860 3199297 I got a watch!<br />You gave me a watch!
3201198 3203000 I don't need a goddamn watch.
3205202 3206304 Yo, Paulie!
3206371 3207872 I got a watch!
3209840 3211509 I got two watches!

3226791 3228158 Yo, Paulie...
3229460 3231396 Rock.
3231462 3233431 It takes guts<br />climbing back in that ring,
3233498 3235433 knowing you're<br />gonna take a beating.
3238536 3240505 You're gonna do all right.
3240571 3241672 How do you know that?
3243808 3245242 The stuff in the basement.
3245310 3246311 (LAUGHS)
3257054 3258423 Thanks, Paulie.
3268098 3269233 You okay?
3269300 3270368 Yeah. Good. How are you?
3270435 3272169 Oh. Fine. This is great.
3272236 3274972 Listen, um... Some guys over<br />there wanna talk to you.
3275039 3277007 Okay. You got it.
3281346 3282813 Thanks for coming by.<br />I appreciate it.
3282880 3284014 No problem. Our pleasure.
3284081 3285182 You wanna hear some stories?
3285249 3287017 -PROMOTER: What kinda stories?<br />-(CHUCKLES)
3287084 3289186 Well, a lot of people<br />like to hear these<br />old fight stories.
3289253 3290821 -PROMOTER: Maybe later.<br />-Okay.
3290888 3294291 I'm Lou DiBella. This is Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixon's manager.
3295292 3296361 Will you sit down and join us?
3296427 3297728 -Sure.<br />-LC: Please.
3299730 3302400 You know,<br />we have the promotional<br />contract for Mason Dixon...
3302467 3304134 -Who's a big fan, by the way.<br />-Really?
3304201 3306337 And when he heard<br />you were interested<br />in fighting again...
3306404 3308773 He thought why not try<br />and work something out.
3308839 3311942 Like a special event.<br />A first-class<br />exhibition fight.
3312943 3314512 Why me?
3314579 3316681 He respects<br />the hell outta you.<br />Alright? And let's be honest.
3316747 3319450 That computer fight<br />got people curious.
3319517 3321118 This could be<br />very interesting.
3321185 3324822 I ain't interested<br />in getting mangled<br />and embarrassed.
3324889 3326957 That's not gonna happen.<br />Never happen.
3327024 3330060 Truthfully,<br />I was thinkin' more on a
3331596 3333764 miniscule, small level.
3333831 3337635 Small fights, not big fights.<br />Small fights.
3337702 3339537 Local. You know what I mean?
3339604 3341506 Not a bad idea.<br />But don't think of it as big.
3341572 3343273 Think of it like I said,<br />like an exhibition.
3343340 3345175 Think of it as<br />a glorified sparring session.
3345242 3346977 And here's something<br />I think you'll like.
3347044 3348746 We're gonna donate a portion<br />of the gate to charity.
3349780 3351015 That's always nice.
3351081 3352316 It's good to give.
3353984 3355653 Where's it taking place?
3355720 3357221 Las Vegas.
3357287 3359490 Nice and warm.<br />This cold's<br />gotta be killing you.
3360425 3361592 Bit stiff.
3361659 3363628 You move better<br />when you're warmer,<br />you know that?
3363694 3365396 -Yeah.<br />-And if nothing else,
3365463 3367832 you'll have new<br />stories to tell.
3367898 3371669 I really gotta<br />think about this.<br />Is that okay?
3371736 3373604 -I understand. No problem.<br />-No problem.
3373671 3375740 I'm gonna go over there.<br />You guys can order something.
3375806 3377141 What do you recommend?
3377207 3378809 -It's all edible.<br />-(LAUGHS)
3381078 3382580 Okay. Thanks.
3384214 3388185 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime?
3388252 3389587 -He'd kill him. Kill him.<br />-You ain't kiddin'.
3391088 3392757 Man, I'm confused...
3396260 3397762 (SOUL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
3400831 3402767 I didn't think this<br />was gonna come along.
3402833 3405503 But this is what<br />you wanted, right?
3405570 3409406 I talk and I talk,<br />and sometimes I think<br />what I'm saying is true
3409474 3413944 and then I look at<br />myself and I'm not even<br />sure what's true anymore.
3414011 3418716 I push this crazy<br />idea about fightin'...<br />What's it all about?
3418783 3421752 Do I really care<br />about standin' toe-to-toe<br />and all that stuff,
3421819 3425523 or like my kid says,<br />is it just ego?
3425590 3427391 Or am I this old<br />pug who's just tryin'
3427458 3429494 to replace old<br />pain with new pain?
3429560 3432096 I don't know.
3433864 3437067 Look, I know I<br />usually don't say a lot.
3437134 3441171 I'm always<br />listenin' and lookin'.
3441238 3446176 But who you are,<br />the part of you<br />that's so full of life...
3446243 3448278 We all have that feeling,<br />that fire,
3448345 3450414 but usually never<br />get a chance to use it.
3450481 3452950 Then it just goes away.
3453017 3458222 But you can.<br />You've got this opportunity,<br />so do it. Why not?
3458288 3462760 This is who you are.<br />This is who you'll always be.
3462827 3466163 And you don't<br />move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.

3483881 3486050 And if this is something<br />that you wanna do...

3544441 3546176 (CLAMORING)
3546243 3547712 FEMALE REPORTER 1: Rocky,<br />a few great fighters<br />have fought in
3547778 3550047 their fifties, often<br />with disastrous results.
3550114 3551816 Why risk the danger<br />and embarrassment?
3551882 3554619 The smart money<br />says you have<br />virtually no chance.
3554685 3557054 A puncher always has a chance.

3566430 3570100 PAULIE: <i>Than to feel bad</i><br /><i>by not doin'</i><br /><i>somethin' you love.</i>

3598829 3600497 Next question.
3600564 3601966 FEMALE REPORTER 1: On the<br />surface this looks<br />like a cheap
3602032 3604168 bit of ring theater between,<br />no offense,
3604234 3608172 a has-been and a man whose own<br />credible legacy and<br />popularity is in doubt.

3610074 3615479 Upside?<br />What do you mean, upside?<br />What do I have to do?
3617915 3620150 I'm thirty-three-and-oh<br />with thirty knockouts.
3620217 3623320 I'm doin' you people a favor.<br />I'm havin' this<br />exhibition for you.
3623387 3625389 And you're gonna get up here<br />and make a mockery out of me?
3625455 3626991 I'm the champ.
3627057 3631061 If I get pissed,<br />this guy gets hurt.<br />See you at the fight.
3631128 3632129 (CLAMORING)
3635966 3637501 The guy is a joke.<br />He's gonna get crushed.
3647211 3649213 Oh! Look who's here.
3649279 3650981 ROBERT: Hi.<br />How you doing, Uncle Paulie?<br />Have you seen my father?
3651048 3652449 In the back.
3653217 3654484 (TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
3661291 3662392 Excuse me.
3664729 3668132 How you doin'?<br />Glad you came by.
3668866 3670234 Can I talk with you?
3670300 3672269 -Sure.<br />-Can we do it outside?
3677775 3678909 So you're goin'<br />through with this?
3678976 3680244 I start training tomorrow.
3680310 3682212 Hey, Rock!
3682279 3684548 I made some connections.<br />I can make
3684614 3686350 some money on this,<br />endorsements.
3687785 3689253 Absolutely. Do that.
3689319 3690788 -Thank you.<br />-Sure.
3692522 3694124 So you nervous<br />about the fight?
3694191 3695826 Scared to death.
3695893 3696961 You don't look scared.
3697027 3698863 I ain't supposed to.
3698929 3701431 Then you don't have to do it.
3701498 3702967 I think I do.
3706937 3711508 You know, living with you<br />hasn't been easy.<br />People see me
3711575 3713643 but they think of you.<br />With all this
3713710 3715846 goin' on, it's gonna<br />be worse than ever.
3715913 3717948 -It don't have to be.<br />-Sure, it does!
3718015 3719716 Why? You've got<br />a lot goin' on, kid.
3719784 3722853 What, my last name?<br />That's the reason<br />I got a decent job.
3722920 3725289 That's why people deal with me<br />in the first place.
3725355 3727224 Now I start to<br />get a little ahead
3727291 3731161 to get a little<br />somethin' for myself,<br />and this happens.
3731228 3735099 I'm askin' you as a favor<br />not to go through with this.<br />Okay?
3735165 3736566 This is gonna<br />end up bad for you,
3736633 3738002 and it's gonna<br />end up bad for me.
3738068 3739269 You think I'm hurting you?
3739336 3741505 In a way, you are.
3741571 3742973 That's the last thing<br />I ever wanted to do.
3743040 3744875 I know that's not<br />what you wanna do,
3744942 3746710 but that's just<br />the way that it is!
3746777 3749279 Don't you care<br />what people think?<br />Doesn't it bother you that
3749346 3751348 people are making<br />you out to be a joke
3751415 3753183 and that I'll be<br />included in that?
3753250 3756020 Do you think that's right?<br />Do you?
3762492 3767531 You ain't gonna believe this.<br />But you used to<br />fit right here.
3767597 3769867 I'd hold you up and<br />say to your mother,
3769934 3772536 "This kid is gonna be<br />the best kid in the world."
3772602 3776173 "This kid is gonna be somebody<br />better than<br />anybody ever knew."
3776240 3779009 And you grew up<br />good and wonderful.
3779076 3782379 It was great just watching,<br />every day was<br />like a privilege.
3782446 3783713 Then the time<br />came for you to be
3783780 3785615 your own man and<br />take on the world,
3785682 3789253 and you did. But somewhere<br />along the line, you changed.
3790154 3791856 You stopped being you.
3791922 3795392 You let people stick<br />a finger in your face<br />and tell you you're no good.
3795459 3797094 And when things<br />got hard, you started
3797161 3798896 lookin' for<br />somethin' to blame,
3798963 3800430 like a big shadow.
3802732 3805169 Lemme tell you somethin'<br />you already know.
3805235 3807704 The world ain't all<br />sunshine and rainbows.
3807771 3809840 It's a very mean<br />and nasty place.
3809907 3811675 And I don't care<br />how tough you are,
3811741 3814811 it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there permanently
3814879 3815946 if you let it.
3816013 3819950 Nobody is gonna<br />hit as hard as life.
3820017 3822186 But it ain't about<br />how hard you hit.
3822252 3824421 It's about how<br />hard you can get hit
3824488 3825923 and keep movin' forward.
3825990 3829259 How much you can take,<br />and keep movin' forward.
3829326 3832096 That's how winnin' is done!
3832162 3835032 If you know what you're worth,<br />then go out and get<br />what you're worth.
3835099 3838368 But you gotta be<br />willin' to take the hits.<br />And not pointing fingers
3838435 3839904 sayin' you aren't<br />where you want to be
3839970 3842606 because of him or her,<br />or anybody!
3842672 3846243 Cowards do that,<br />and that ain't you!<br />You're better than that!
3853918 3858288 I'm always gonna love you,<br />no matter what happens.
3859589 3862026 You're my son and<br />you're my blood.
3862092 3864494 You're the best<br />thing in my life.
3866463 3870234 But until you start<br />believing in yourself,<br />you ain't gonna have a life.
3875305 3877074 Don't forget to<br />visit your mother.
3927724 3928858 Those are beautiful.
3932262 3934064 You get off early from work?
3934131 3938302 No. I left. I quit.
3939936 3941271 Quit, why?
3941838 3942906 (SIGHS)
3942973 3944474 I wasn't very...
3946010 3948878 I just didn't fit in there.
3951015 3952116 I understand.
3957221 3958355 So what are you gonna do?
3958422 3959523 Right now?
3962026 3963227 Right now I'd<br />rather be with you.
3966896 3967897 Is that alright?
3969866 3972002 Yeah.
3972069 3974171 It's been a long time<br />since I've seen a fight.
3986850 3989786 DUKE: <i>You know all there</i><br /><i>is to know about fighting,</i><br /><i>so there's no sense</i>
3989853 3992256 <i>going down</i><br /><i>that same road again.</i>
3992322 3996460 To beat this guy,<br />you need speed.<br />You don't have it.
3998262 4002266 And your knees<br />can't take the pounding.<br />So hard running is out.
4002332 4004201 And you've got<br />arthritis in your neck.
4004268 4006070 And you've got<br />calcium deposits
4006136 4009339 on most of your joints.<br />So sparring is out.
4010407 4012842 I had that problem.
4012909 4018148 So what we'll be calling on is<br />good old-fashioned<br />blunt force trauma.
4018215 4022986 Horsepower.<br />Heavy duty, cast-iron,<br />pile-driving punches
4023053 4026290 that will have to hurt so much<br />they'll rattle his ancestors.
4026356 4028458 Every time you<br />hit him with a shot,
4028525 4031261 it's got to feel like<br />he tried kissing<br />the express train.
4032862 4036533 Yeah! Let's start building<br />some hurting bombs.

4841337 4843172 <i>We went over the rules in</i><br /><i>the dressing room.</i>
4843239 4846842 <i>I expect a good, clean fight.</i><br /><i>Watch the kidney punches,</i><br /><i>rabbit punches,</i>

4855218 4856752 LAMPLEY: <i>The champ is not</i><br /><i>in the best shape</i>
4856819 4858654 <i>we've seen him in.</i><br /><i>Maybe he just plans</i>

4861590 4862858 Love you, kid.<br />Glad you could make it.
4862926 4865261 KELLERMAN: <i>One thing about</i><br /><i>Rocky we know for sure,</i>
4865328 4867897 <i>this guy's</i><br /><i>showing up in shape.</i>
4867964 4869165 The old man's crazy.
4869232 4870333 He's gotta be crazy.
4870399 4871767 -He's in here.<br />-Okay.
4871834 4874837 Just take it easy.<br />This is an exhibition.<br />Alright? Do it to him!
4874904 4876239 You got three<br />rounds to set a pace.
4876305 4877840 Every time you hit him,<br />you gotta make a dent.
4877907 4880043 Got it.
4880109 4884513 KELLERMAN: <i>The moments</i><br /><i>before a Rocky Balboa fight?</i><br /><i>I can't believe it's here!</i>
4884580 4888184 -(BELL RINGS)<br /><i>-Round one begins.</i><br /><i>If old George Forman</i>
4888251 4892455 <i>shocked</i><br /><i>the world with one punch,</i><br /><i>why can't old Rocky Balboa?</i>
4892521 4895091 LAMPLEY: And <i>as much</i><br /><i>excitement as there</i><br /><i>is in the arena,</i>
4895158 4897193 <i>there's a sense of foreboding,</i><br /><i>as well.</i>
4901797 4903632 <i>And now,</i><br /><i>Mason "The Line" Dixon</i>
4903699 4906069 <i>goes to work with</i><br /><i>his jab as though</i>
4906135 4908004 <i>he's fighting against the</i><br /><i>number one challenger</i>
4908071 4909705 <i>in the heavyweight division.</i>
4909772 4911975 KELLERMAN: <i>This is to be</i><br /><i>expected early on.</i>
4912041 4914010 <i>You knew the champ</i><br /><i>was going to</i><br /><i>control the distance</i>
4914077 4915945 <i>with his jab,</i><br /><i>his height, his range.</i>
4918247 4922018 LAMPLEY: <i>Balboa, looking</i><br /><i>to gain a shot, misses wildly.</i>
4924087 4927156 MERCHANT: <i>It looks like</i><br /><i>a speed bag</i><br /><i>against a punching bag.</i>
4927223 4929092 LAMPLEY: <i>Rocky is</i><br /><i>understandably frustrated,</i>
4929158 4931327 <i>but he came out of retirement</i><br /><i>to get into a fight.</i>
4931394 4934097 KELLERMAN: Guys <i>named</i><br /><i>Rocky don't like</i><br /><i>to be toyed with.</i>
4934163 4935931 <i>One punch could</i><br /><i>still turn it around.</i>
4935999 4939435 MERCHANT: <i>Apparently he</i><br /><i>forgot his arthritis meds</i><br /><i>this morning.</i>
4939502 4941204 LAMPLEY: <i>Rocky misses.</i>
4941270 4944373 <i>There's a meat-seeking missile</i><br /><i>on the point of</i><br /><i>the chin by the champ!</i>
4944440 4947910 -(CROWD CHANTING)<br /><i>-More pinpoint jabs by Dixon!</i>
4947977 4951480 <i>And there's a hard</i><br /><i>right hand and a left</i><br /><i>and a right by Balboa!</i>
4951547 4954984 <i>-He drives Dixon into the</i><br /><i>ropes with a series of shots!</i><br />-(CROWD CHEERING)
4955051 4956685 <i>And the crowd goes berserk!</i>
4956752 4957920 (GRUNTING)
4961957 4966395 <i>Dixon punishing</i><br /><i>Balboa for the temerity</i><br /><i>of landing those shots.</i>
4969765 4973669 <i>It's toe-to-toe in the corner.</i><br /><i>Balboa and Dixon</i><br /><i>letting it all go.</i>
4979442 4981110 (BELL RINGS)
4981177 4984380 <i>Balboa landing</i><br /><i>potent combinations</i><br /><i>to the head of the champion.</i>
4984447 4986015 <i>A wake-up call for Dixon.</i>
4986082 4987916 -You alright?<br />-Yeah.
4987983 4989718 The man's got<br />bricks in his gloves.
4989785 4991020 What happened to<br />the angry stuff<br />in the basement?
4991087 4992488 It's still there.
4992555 4993956 -He came to battle, okay?<br />-He tried to knock me out.
4994023 4995558 Listen to me.<br />If there's any bone
4995624 4997460 in your body he can break,<br />he's gonna do it.
4997526 4999095 -His bones break, too.<br />-Give the man<br />a little respect.
4999162 5000729 What about my respect?
5000796 5002665 LAMPLEY: <i>Compubox numbers</i><br /><i>tell the grisly story here.</i>
5002731 5006235 <i>Balboa landed nine</i><br /><i>of thirteen punches</i><br /><i>in that round.</i>
5006302 5011274 <i>Dixon landed</i><br /><i>an incredible fifty-nine</i><br /><i>out of sixty-nine.</i>
5011340 5012741 Why don't you<br />listen to me this time!
5012808 5015211 KELLERMAN: <i>Rocky's been</i><br /><i>here a million times before.</i>
5015278 5016845 <i>Coming out to</i><br /><i>start another round</i>
5016912 5018414 <i>after he took</i><br /><i>a beating in the previous one.</i>
5018481 5019615 Remember what I said, okay?
5019682 5021750 I warned him.
5021817 5023652 -(CROWD CHANTING)<br />-(BELL RINGS)
5023719 5027490 LAMPLEY: He's <i>tired.</i><br /><i>His legs are going fast,</i><br /><i>or already gone.</i>
5027556 5032561 KELLERMAN: And <i>what's</i><br /><i>truly extraordinary is that</i><br /><i>Rocky can still take it.</i>
5032628 5037166 MERCHANT: <i>The boxing</i><br /><i>commission, which, was</i><br /><i>criticized for licensing him</i>
5037233 5040936 <i>would be massacred if</i><br /><i>something happened to Rocky.</i>
5042071 5043072 (GRUNTING)
5045274 5048244 LAMPLEY: And <i>a monstrous</i><br /><i>straight left hand!</i><br /><i>Down goes Rocky!</i>
5048311 5050513 <i>And that could conceivably</i><br /><i>be the end of the fight!</i>
5050579 5054383 <i>That could be</i><br /><i>the exhibition right there!</i><br /><i>But no! Balboa is up!</i>
5054450 5056985 <i>Referee Joe</i><br /><i>Cortez asks if he wants</i>
5057052 5059188 <i>to continue,</i><br /><i>and Rocky says yes.</i>
5059255 5062258 <i>Even Rocky Balboa</i><br /><i>could be too brave</i><br /><i>for his own good.</i>
5062325 5065894 <i>Dixon comes right</i><br /><i>back to try to finish it!</i><br /><i>Balboa almost went down!</i>
5065961 5068197 MERCHANT: <i>Rocky actually</i><br /><i>shoves Dixon back.</i>
5068264 5070499 LAMPLEY: <i>As Dixon lands</i><br /><i>these brutal shots!</i>
5070566 5072335 Cover up! Cover up!
5072401 5076172 <i>Open shots at close range,</i><br /><i>right and left</i><br /><i>hands, and down goes Balboa!</i>
5076239 5079175 -(CROWD BOOING)<br /><i>-Perhaps for the last time in</i><br /><i>his fighting career!</i>

5089952 5091254 How do you feel, Mac?<br />You okay?
5091320 5093689 LAMPLEY: Now <i>Rocky is</i><br /><i>furious with himself.</i>
5093756 5095958 <i>He convinces Cortez</i><br /><i>he wants to keep fighting!</i>
5096024 5097893 <i>Dixon's pointing at</i><br /><i>the ref to end it,</i>
5097960 5100129 <i>Rocky waving his arms</i><br /><i>and saying he's fine!</i>
5100196 5101997 <i>-He wants to go on!</i><br />-Let it go! Let it go!
5103299 5106135 <i>And Balboa comes back!</i><br /><i>With a left and a right</i>
5106202 5109372 <i>and bulls Dixon into the ropes</i><br /><i>for the second round in a row!</i>
5110139 5111807 (CROWD BOOING)

5125221 5128891 <i>Balboa ripping</i><br /><i>away at Dixon's body!</i><br /><i>These are big punches.</i>
5132561 5133562 (CROWD CHEERING)
5137566 5141970 <i>Rocky Balboa has</i><br /><i>knocked the reigning</i><br /><i>heavyweight champion down!</i>

5146642 5148477 <i>in his entire</i><br /><i>professional career!</i>
5148544 5150078 KELLERMAN: <i>Maybe he's</i><br /><i>clearing his head, guys,</i>
5150145 5152748 <i>but the body shots</i><br /><i>really caved in his ribs.</i>
5152815 5155918 LAMPLEY: <i>Balboa is</i><br /><i>thinking knockout himself!</i>
5155984 5159188 KELLERMAN: <i>Another</i><br /><i>counterhook by Balboa,</i><br /><i>followed by two more!</i>
5159255 5162391 LAMPLEY: <i>Dixon fires</i><br /><i>back his own hooks!</i><br /><i>Now Rocky's stunned.</i>
