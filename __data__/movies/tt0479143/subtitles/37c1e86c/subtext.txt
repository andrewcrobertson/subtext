107524 111194 [man 1] Yet another quick knockout<br />for Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.
111278 113238 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
113322 116491 [man 2] Hide the women and children.<br />This could get ugly.
116575 120704 [man 1] This crowd does nothing to hide<br />its anger over this latest debacle.
121288 124166 [man 3] The fans are mad as hell.<br />They don't want to take it anymore.
124249 127044 They seem to be blaming Dixon,<br />a good fighter, for the decline,
127127 129630 not only of the heavyweight division guys,
129713 131506 but of the entire sport.
131590 135177 [man 1] They're pelting the undefeated<br />heavyweight champion
135260 136970 of the world with ice.
137054 139389 [man 3]<br />Maybe this angry, visceral reaction
139473 141350 will pressure Dixon to fight someone
141433 144061 who can fight back for a change,<br />if there's somebody out there.
144144 146647 [man 2]<br />All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
146730 149191 who thrills us with his passion.

391933 393184 Your kid should've been here.

506923 508299 What do you mean?
508383 511469 Well, I don't know exactly<br />what I mean, but...
511553 515557 I just think that when I come here,<br />you don't feel so comfortable.
515640 517767 And I certainly don't wanna do that.
519060 521521 Well, you throw a big shadow.
521604 522439 A big shadow?

563646 567025 I gotta get going.<br />Um, I'll change my plans for tonight.
567108 569194 That would be great.<br />I'm looking forward to it.
569277 570820 -How you doing?<br />-Okay.
570904 571905 Okay.

661035 662203 Ah, he's okay.

711586 715548 and I unloaded everything I had,<br />hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
715632 718301 But Creed kept busting me back<br />pretty good,
718384 720386 and the agony began to pile up.
720470 723264 Then I heard the best sound<br />I ever heard in my life...

732023 733691 when Mickey leans into my ear and says,
733775 737028 "Get out there<br />and fight this guy hard, you bum.

1156280 1159283 [Adrian speaking indistinctly]
1161243 1162912 [Paulie] Come on, Rock. Let's go.
1165706 1169877 We're done. There's no place<br />to sit down around here.
1169960 1171170 It's all right.
1171253 1172380 It ain't all right.
1172463 1175091 It's depressing and freaking cold.
1176759 1178052 What's the matter with you?
1178636 1180554 You're living backwards.
1180638 1184183 Change the channel from yesterday.<br />Yesterday wasn't so great.
1184266 1185643 It was to me.
1185726 1186811 Not to me.
1188688 1191816 You treated her good.<br />You had the good times.
1192775 1196237 I treated her bad.<br />I don't have to think about this.
1197697 1199824 She always loved you.
1204161 1207373 Sorry, I can't do this no more.
1217717 1220720 [poignant music continues]
1248706 1250624 [music fades]
1259508 1262636 [rock music playing over speakers]
1262720 1265139 [bartender and customers chattering]
1267516 1269643 -Hey.<br />-Hey, Rocko.
1269727 1270936 [customers chattering]
1271020 1273105 [Rocky] Hey, how you doing, guys?<br />How have you been?
1273189 1275191 Yeah. How you doing?
1275775 1278444 Very good.<br />Ain't been down here in a while.
1278527 1280321 There you go. Good to see you.
1280404 1282448 Good, good. Hey, guys.
1283491 1287620 Hey. What's up? Hey, all right. Good.
1290956 1294335 Yeah, you guys are looking good.<br />Looking good.
1296212 1297171 How you been?
1297254 1299298 [man] Thought I was seeing things.
1299381 1301008 Maybe I am seeing things.
1301091 1303594 How you doing, champ?<br />What, are you lost or something?
1303677 1305596 I can't miss this place a little bit?
1305679 1307848 I thought I'd never see you around here.
1307932 1309767 Yeah, well, you never know.
1310643 1311977 Hey, what happened to your leg?
1312061 1314230 Ah, lost it to diabetes.
1314313 1315147 Sit down.
1317149 1318275 I keep back here
1318359 1321862 "cause I don't want nobody<br />feeling bad for me or crap like that.
1321946 1323531 I feel bad for you, you know?
1324532 1327034 -Yeah, it's one way to lose weight, right?<br />-Yeah.
1327868 1328828 [Rocky chuckles]
1328911 1332206 Yeah. Hey, listen, why'd they tear<br />the old place down? I went by there.
1332289 1334250 -Progress. Who knows?<br />-Yeah?
1334333 1336544 Hey, um, listen, I, uh--
1336627 1339296 I read where your wife passed on<br />a while back.
1339380 1341131 Yeah, it was a woman cancer.
1341215 1344134 -Yeah, nice girl.<br />-The best. The best.
1344718 1346220 What are you drinking?
1346303 1349014 Uh, I'll just have a beer. A short beer.
1350057 1352643 Yo, Marie. You know this bum?
1353519 1354979 Yeah, we met a long time ago.
1355563 1356564 Yeah?
1356647 1360317 When I was a kid, you walked me home.<br />It was a hundred years ago.
1360401 1361235 I did?
1361318 1364321 Yeah. You told me<br />to stop smoking and things.
1364405 1365656 I knew your brother.
1365739 1369994 Are you little Marie that used to hang out<br />at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
1370077 1371370 Yeah, you remember that?
1371453 1374832 Yeah, I do. I walked you home<br />and you said, "Screw you, creepo."
1375457 1376458 No, I didn't say that.
1376542 1379044 -Yeah, you did.<br />-You sure?
1379128 1380796 [Rocky] It was very distinct.
1380880 1383299 Great insults last a long time.
1383382 1385009 Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
1385092 1386260 Oh, hey, listen, Marie.
1386343 1388637 I'm way, way, way, way past that.<br />It's, uh...
1394059 1395269 Hope she wasn't mad.
1395352 1396312 You know, it's amazing,
1396395 1399356 it's like I can't remember<br />what I had for breakfast
1399440 1401609 but I can remember the name<br />of a hoagie shop
1401692 1404069 I haven't been to in 30 years.<br />It's baffling to me.
1404153 1406780 My brain's turned to mush too.<br />Don't worry about it.
1406864 1408282 -Yo.<br />-Disappearing.
1408365 1412036 Yo, hey, is that you? Is that really you?<br />How you doing?
1412119 1413913 Hey, we're having a drink here.
1413996 1416665 Okay, okay. Do what you gotta do.
1416749 1420085 Yeah, my father said you're pretty good.<br />You're from around here, right?
1420169 1424173 -Yeah. It's, uh, good meeting you.<br />-Yeah.
1424256 1426759 So, what are you doing back here?
1426842 1427927 Hey, we're talking here.
1428010 1432139 Okay, okay. Chill out. You can talk.<br />I'm not talking to you.
1432222 1433057 Yeah, so listen.
1433140 1437895 Me and my pals, we over there.<br />Think you could buy us a round?
1437978 1439605 Come on, you got the money.
1439688 1440606 Yeah. It's okay.
1440689 1442816 What are you pushing my hand away for?
1442900 1443776 What's your name?
1443859 1445027 Angie.
1445110 1448322 Angie, uh, don't be playing a fool<br />for that guy, all right?
1448405 1449323 -A fool?<br />-Yeah.
1449907 1454036 A fool? Me, a fool?<br />You're the fool, not me.
1454119 1456497 You ain't no better than me.<br />That's bullshit.
1456580 1458874 -[Rocky] I didn't say that.<br />-You ain't no better than me.
1458958 1461377 You ain't no better<br />than anybody up in here.
1461460 1463295 Who you think you are?
1463379 1466882 One second they like you,<br />the next second you're a bum.
1466966 1468717 Ain't you glad you dropped in?
1468801 1470135 I was just thinking that.
1470928 1474139 Hey, listen. As soon as Rock finishes,<br />I'm closing up.
1474223 1475808 Uh, why don't you take off?
1475891 1477893 I'll tally up with Amy.
1477977 1480062 Maybe Rocky will give you a ride home.
1481188 1483857 -Yeah, I could. Yeah. Take care.<br />-Good seeing you, champ.
1485734 1487486 Uh, you live around here?
1487569 1489154 About eight blocks from here.
1492032 1493242 You want a lift?
1494410 1495452 Yeah.
1500124 1501625 Did you ever get married?
1502167 1503335 Yeah, sort of.
1503419 1505337 -Sort of?<br />-Well, he took off.
1505421 1506797 Ah, poof, just like that?
1506880 1508215 Yeah, just like that.
1509341 1510926 You sort of have any kids?
1511010 1512386 Yeah, I've got one kid.
1512469 1516015 Me too. Wonderful boy.
1516098 1519643 Tough guy. What's the matter,<br />you can't buy a round?
1520310 1522730 The girl was being nice to your dumb ass.
1523272 1525441 Think you can come around here<br />and disrespect us?
1525524 1528861 -You keep it up. You come on back.<br />-She's nothing but a jealous bitch.
1528944 1530279 [Rocky] Don't listen to them.
1534199 1537286 [man] Come over here,<br />you'll get your head kicked in.
1537369 1540789 -You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.<br />-You ain't no big shot.
1540873 1544960 You ain't even got a car<br />to take that pig home.
1547046 1548422 [engine starts]
1548505 1549631 You all right?
1551341 1552176 Yeah.
1554762 1557598 What are you doing?<br />Don't get out. It's all right.
1560601 1563020 No, Little Marie. It ain't all right.
1568609 1570277 -Yo!<br />-[man] What?
1570360 1573530 I'll tell you what. You get inside.
1574073 1575532 [Angie] Hey, leave him alone.
1575616 1576909 [man whimpers]
1576992 1579453 -You see that? You see that?<br />-Yeah. all right.
1579536 1580537 What do you say?
1580621 1582998 -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br />-[Rocky] Get a job.
1588754 1591757 [poignant music playing]
1596929 1597971 [engine starts]
1599765 1601642 That guy sends his apologies.
1602810 1603977 Okay.
1620953 1625207 [Mason] Martin. Yo, Martin.
1630170 1631922 I see you still got your key.
1632005 1634675 Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?
1634758 1637553 I got a lot of time<br />since your people let me go.
1637636 1639304 You know I had nothing to do with that.
1640139 1640973 Yeah.
1643350 1645394 We moved in about a year ago.
1645477 1646311 Yeah?
1646395 1647771 It's only temporary.
1647855 1649231 [Rocky] I could see that.
1649314 1651024 [Marie] I'm gonna look for an apartment.
1651108 1652818 [Rocky] Apartments are nice.
1652901 1654486 [Marie] It is what it is.
1654570 1656113 It is what it is.
1656738 1660367 But this place used to be pretty nice.<br />There's a lot of history around here.
1660450 1661285 Yeah.
1661368 1665539 Down the street is the Cambria Fight Club.<br />They used to call it the Bucket of Blood.
1665622 1668876 I took some massive beatings there.<br />But it was nice. Good memories.
1668959 1673589 And I heard these buildings<br />are 100, 150 years old.
1674339 1677050 If I was 150 years old,<br />I'd be falling apart too.
1677134 1679428 So it's okay, building.
1679511 1680762 Does that light work?
1680846 1683265 Nah, it's burnt out or something.
1686268 1690272 Listen, thanks for the ride,<br />and I'm sorry about those guys.
1690355 1694067 Some of those guys just got<br />their brains on backwards and stuff.
1694151 1695777 What's he doing out so late?
1695861 1697029 Is that your kid?
1697112 1699364 Yeah. Wish he wouldn't stay out so late.
1699448 1700741 [Rocky] Amazing.
1701617 1702451 What's that?
1702534 1704286 Oh, last time I seen you,
1704369 1707873 you was a kid, and now<br />you officially got one of your own.
1707956 1713212 It's amazing. You know, he resembles you.<br />He's got that big Irish hair.
1714254 1715422 It's the other one.
1718675 1719509 Yeah?
1719593 1721261 His father was from Jamaica.
1721345 1722763 Jamaica? European...
1725849 1727476 Was you on a cruise ship or something?
1728477 1729478 Not really.
1729561 1731355 -What's his name?<br />-Steps.
1732522 1735067 -Short for Stevenson.<br />-Ah, makes sense.
1738403 1742199 Does he look mad at me,<br />or is it maybe the angle I'm standing at?
1742282 1744618 -No. He's a good kid.<br />-Ah.
1744701 1745619 You wanna meet him?
1745702 1749790 You know, it's getting kind of late.<br />I got so much to do.
1749873 1750958 I understand.
1752084 1755087 Thanks again for the ride<br />and, um, everything else.
1757798 1758882 I'll see you.
1760425 1761260 [Marie] You too.
1762177 1765597 Steps. Let's go.<br />Say goodnight to your friend.
1766139 1768767 What are you doing out in the cold<br />with no hat on?
1768850 1772396 -Did you get something to eat?<br />-[Steps] Yeah, I already ate.
1773313 1776233 [Marie] It's late, you know.<br />What are you doing...?
1776316 1777567 Yo, Little Marie.
1779444 1781863 Ain't you gonna introduce me to your kid?
1781947 1783198 How you doing, Steps?
1783282 1784449 What's up?
1784533 1789204 Listen, I have this restaurant,<br />nice little eatery not too far from here.
1789288 1790872 All this junk. A tissue.
1791623 1795335 Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo,<br />all the stuff in my pocket.
1795419 1797587 Here you go. I've got a card, there it is.
1797671 1799381 And, uh, if you ever get a chance,
1799464 1802718 it'd be great<br />if both of you came down there to eat.
1802801 1808015 It'd be great, free... Anyway,<br />I'll leave it over there under... Here.
1808098 1809891 [poignant music playing]
1809975 1812853 I'll leave it on the steps. Steps...
1814146 1815147 [chuckles]
1817190 1818025 See you later.
1820819 1821903 Come on, let's go.
1825490 1829745 You've known what was best for you since<br />you were 10 and walked in here alone.
1830787 1834291 Got everything money can buy,<br />except what it can't.
1836084 1840172 It's pride. Pride is what<br />got your ass out of here.
1841631 1843550 Losing is what brought you back.
1844968 1849890 People like you, they need to be tested.<br />Need a challenge.
1849973 1852893 You know that ain't gonna happen.<br />Ain't nothing out there, Martin.
1852976 1856021 There's always somebody out there. Always.
1856605 1857898 When that time comes
1857981 1861485 and something's standing in front of you<br />that ain't running,
1861568 1864196 that ain't backing up,<br />and is hitting on you,
1864279 1866615 and you're too damn tired to breathe...
1867407 1870452 You find that situation on you,<br />that's good.
1870535 1872996 Because that's baptism under fire.
1874956 1875874 You get through that,
1875957 1879252 you find the only kind of respect<br />that matters in this damn world,
1879795 1881046 self-respect.
1884591 1886510 Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.
1887427 1889262 Now what can the champ do for you?
1890680 1892474 You can give me some<br />of that money you got.
1892557 1894601 [both laughing]
1894684 1897062 -You know, I like you, Martin.<br />-But not that much.
1904152 1906196 How about a picture with the kid?<br />That all right?
1906279 1907280 Sure.
1909991 1912494 Here, son, hold up your fist.<br />Makes you look more hazardous.
1915122 1916415 -There you go.<br />-Thanks, Rock.
1916498 1917916 [Rocky] Enjoy your meal.
1919209 1921044 -He's a nice guy, isn't he?<br />-[Isabel] Rocky?
1921128 1923380 -Yeah.<br />-Spider just went downstairs.
1923463 1924923 I don't know if that's all right.
1925006 1926174 What's he doing down there?
1926258 1927884 I don't know. That's your friend.
1934558 1935559 Yo, Spider.
1936101 1938311 Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
1938395 1939563 Come on. You're my guest.
1939646 1940730 Let me do something.
1940814 1942232 Keep eating. Guests do that.
1942315 1944776 Don't make me fight you again.<br />Last time you got lucky.
1945444 1947404 Lucky? Okay.
1947487 1949114 Jesus wants me to work.
1949990 1951324 [Isabel] Rocky?
1951408 1953577 -Yeah?<br />-You've got guests.
1956079 1957956 Don't get too wet, okay?
1959249 1961168 Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

1967591 1969092 You kept the card.
1969634 1971219 Yeah, I kept the card.
1971303 1973722 -Why don't you sit down?<br />-[Marie] Sure.

2043875 2047712 Mason Dixon in his career has basically<br />been spoon-fed his opponents.
2047796 2051550 No question in my mind. Not only does<br />Rocky win, but he wins by a knockout.
2051633 2053260 -[crowd cheering]<br />-Yeah.
2053843 2055220 Rocky.
2056846 2057681 Offspring.
2057764 2060016 -[yells]<br />-[Brian] Bernard, what do you think?
2060100 2061935 Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.
2062018 2063478 He's never been in
2063562 2067148 <i>real knockdown, drag-out brawls.<br />He's never had to dig down to rally back.</i>
2067232 2069568 If he tries to dig down against Balboa,
2069651 2072070 he'll find he doesn't have<br />a big enough shovel.
2072153 2074114 I clearly give it to Balboa.
2074197 2075073 Yeah.
2075156 2076866 What happened to you, man?
2077450 2079452 -What happened to you?<br />-[chattering]
2079536 2081079 [Brian] And Bert Randolph Sugar.
2081162 2084457 Dixon has fought creampuffs.<br />So we really don't know what he's made of.
2084541 2088837 But both in their primes, you have<br />to factor in Dixon's unbelievable speed.
2088920 2091631 His slashing offense.<br />He cuts Balboa to bits.
2091715 2094634 No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.
2096052 2097846 [Brian]<br />Here's where our subjectivity ends.
2097929 2100056 Let's see what the computer has to say.
2100599 2103685 [announcer] Dixon unloads on Balboa.<br />Rocky has no answer.
2103768 2105312 Balboa is eating jabs...
2106313 2108148 [chattering]
2108231 2110942 -[man] What time is it?<br />-[crowd] Mason time!
2111026 2113278 -[man] What time is it?<br />-[crowd] Mason time!
2113361 2116072 [dramatic music playing]
2116156 2118241 [cheering]
2121578 2124080 [announcer]<br />Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.
2124164 2126124 He is almost out on his feet.
2126207 2129336 Balboa turning up the heat.<br />Hounds him across the ring.
2129419 2132756 He's bit off more than<br />he can chew this time. Believe it.
2132839 2136926 A murderous right hook.<br />And Dixon is out on his feet.
2137010 2139888 He is out cold<br />as he crumbles to the canvas.
2139971 2142932 And it is Balboa who has won the event.
2143016 2145143 -Beat the odds.<br />-[cheering]
2145226 2148146 Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky.
2150482 2153485 ['Ooh Baby Baby" playing on radio]
2154819 2158281 I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat<br />that up, it's pretty good in the morning.
2160408 2161826 [Steps] Thanks, man.
2162410 2166039 Nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving<br />you a headache. I like this old stuff.
2166122 2168416 No, I like it. It's nice.
2169000 2169834 Well, good.
2170919 2171753 Good.
2173672 2176466 # I lost you #
2176549 2180178 # What a price to pay... #
2180261 2184599 You think Steps wants a job?<br />You know, make a few bucks in a weekend?
2184683 2188311 It's good making your own G's.<br />My kid stashed a few bucks doing that.
2188978 2190605 Why are you being so nice?
2191940 2194025 I don't want you to think nothing's off,<br />you know.
2194109 2197362 My wife is gone, but she ain't.<br />You know what I mean?
2197445 2199656 I wasn't thinking that. Believe me.
2199739 2200657 -No?
2200740 2202450 Then what were you thinking?
2202534 2205453 That you don't owe us nothing.<br />What are you doing?
2205537 2207914 Be patient. Now...
2209290 2212377 I don't owe you nothing,<br />but why do you have to...
2213336 2215755 owe something to get...?
2215839 2217716 -Yo! Yikes.<br />-Whoo.
2217799 2219092 Bingo.
2224597 2228768 Why do you have to owe something<br />to get something? Really?
2231688 2234482 I think hanging out<br />with your kid would be nice.
2234566 2235650 What do you think?
2235734 2237360 I think that would be nice.
2238903 2241948 Good. That's very nice.
2242490 2243867 I'm glad you come by.
2245160 2247537 Nice, uh, watching you eat.
2250331 2251374 Good company.
2254836 2257672 Yo, Little Marie. Let there be light.
2257756 2259758 -[laughs]<br />-[engine starts]
2260592 2264304 # Whisper I still love you #
2264387 2268767 # Until that day is here #
2271269 2274272 [poignant music playing]
2276232 2277984 You know, this thing is...
2280945 2285325 I know you're gone<br />'cause I visit your grave.
2287744 2290205 But I keep expecting you<br />to be waiting at home.
2293958 2296377 I never knew I could<br />have these kind of thoughts.
2296461 2297629 It's like...
2300089 2302967 some kind of crazy game God is playing.
2303843 2307388 And I'm gonna go home,<br />the lights will be on,
2308223 2310892 people will yell, "Surprise!"<br />and out steps you.
2314312 2317273 That ain't never gonna happen,<br />but I keep thinking it will.
2319859 2321361 Okay.
2323822 2327492 You know, I tried talking to the kid,<br />but I think we're just...
2328743 2331079 just going in these different directions.
2333248 2335500 Everything's going<br />in a different direction.
2339337 2341840 It's like I ain't done nothing right<br />since you left.
2345969 2347595 You know, sometimes...
2349931 2351724 I think I almost hate God.
2353810 2355311 I really do.
2362735 2363736 [music fades]
2363820 2366239 How come nobody else<br />is helping us unload this stuff?
2366322 2369742 I mean, you paid for it.<br />How come we gotta do it?
2369826 2371369 Make your head strong.
2371452 2373413 What's that supposed to mean?
2373496 2377083 Well, I think working hard<br />makes your head strong.
2377959 2382589 You know, like when I was a kid,<br />I'd stare off at these, uh, street lights
2382672 2384924 for like 30 minutes, and try not to blink.
2385008 2388928 Or I'd be squeezing a ball until I thought<br />my hand was gonna explode.
2389971 2391055 Why?
2391139 2393933 Well, I was teaching myself<br />to be uncomfortable.
2395476 2399689 "Cause I knew being uncomfortable<br />might come in handy someday
2399772 2401983 like when I was in the ring and such.
2402066 2404027 Yeah, so why you telling me all this?
2404110 2406112 Just making conversation.
2406195 2408072 Yeah, you don't need to.
2408948 2411284 Who should I be talking to? The pigeons?
2414662 2416664 So how come you call my ma "Little Marie"?
2416748 2418249 Oh, that's how I know her.
2418333 2420543 Yeah, well, she isn't little no more.
2422170 2423963 I ain't calling her large.
2424047 2425173 Why not?
2426424 2428176 You shouldn't be goofing on your mother.
2428259 2429844 Look, man, she's my mother.
2430595 2432430 I know she's your mother,
2434223 2438061 but a mother should be goof-proof.
2445109 2446444 You know, uh...
2447987 2449822 heard from your father lately?
2450615 2451449 Why?
2452200 2454285 Uh, just curious, uh...
2456788 2458998 Him not being around bother you?
2460291 2461376 No.
2462961 2463878 Not at all?
2463962 2465296 I said it doesn't.
2466339 2467423 Okay.
2470009 2473805 When my old man took it on the arches,<br />it really bothered me.
2473888 2476182 And my mother took off too,<br />like in a different direction.
2476265 2479060 So... I kind of understand.
2483106 2484107 So what did you do?
2484899 2487068 Nothing. There's, you know,<br />nothing you can do.
2487151 2489737 It bothers me,<br />but what are you gonna do about it?
2489821 2492281 Cry every day? You take your lumps.
2492365 2495952 Everybody's got lumps.<br />It's a lumpy life, period.
2496035 2497203 But you...
2497954 2501040 well, you're really lucky<br />"cause you got a mother that loves you.
2501124 2502959 And she ain't quitting you.
2503042 2505503 So you gotta be listening to her
2505586 2509590 'cause if you listen to them dumbbells<br />on the street over there,
2509674 2514178 you're gonna end up<br />doing a lot of wrong like me.
2514262 2516014 A lot of wrong like you?
2516514 2518307 Man, you made it all the way.
2518391 2520685 No, that was freak luck.
2520768 2522812 Well, I'll take some of that freak luck.
2522895 2525898 No, waiting for freak luck is for suckers.
2526607 2527984 It worked for you.
2528943 2529861 You know...
2529944 2532030 [poignant music playing]
2532113 2536159 I got a break. I had this silly name,<br />"the Italian Stallion."
2537035 2540872 People thought it was kind of a joke,<br />some, like a joke that backfired.
2541664 2543624 If you want something,<br />you gotta go out and get it,
2543708 2545418 not be waiting for freak luck, you know?
2545501 2546919 You know what I'm talking about.
2548004 2550131 So you think you got it all together?
2554218 2558139 Would I be climbing into a hole in cement<br />if I had it all together?
2560892 2562518 No, I don't think so.
2563436 2565563 So why are you wasting my time?
2565646 2567732 You don't gotta talk to me<br />if you don't want to.
2571360 2572361 You like dogs?
2572987 2574030 Dogs?
2574614 2575531 Dogs.
2576908 2578451 [Steps] So what is this place?
2578534 2579786 [dogs barking]
2579869 2583206 [Rocky] This is like a dog pound.<br />It's where they keep...
2583915 2585583 a large variety of dogs.
2586334 2588544 I used to come here all the time<br />before a fight.
2589212 2593633 You learn a lot talking to dogs.<br />Really, you do.
2593716 2597762 Yeah. Hey, how about this one?
2600181 2602141 He don't look too friendly, my friend.
2602225 2605269 Man, this is the one.<br />Hey, boy, how you doing?
2605353 2608147 Hey, what about this one here?<br />Come here, boy.
2608231 2609816 -[Steps] Who, him?<br />-[Rocky] Why not?
2609899 2612151 Aw, hell, no. That's one ugly dog.
2612235 2616823 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.<br />If you look at it closely, the color,
2616906 2620910 it looks like old furniture, like<br />some kind of pirate chest thing going on.
2620993 2623454 Yeah, sure. Hey, how about a young one?
2623538 2627125 Steps, forget him. Come here.<br />I want you to see something.
2627208 2629669 Notice what this animal is doing here?
2629752 2631462 Lying in that position?
2631546 2632964 He ain't doing nothing.
2633047 2635925 No, he's doing a lot.<br />He ain't wasting no energy.
2636008 2637093 Because he's dead.
2643683 2646727 He ain't dead. There's a lot<br />of good mileage left on that animal.
2646811 2650690 Some good food, a couple of new friends,<br />bingo, he's back.
2650773 2652316 What do you think is a good name?
2652400 2654110 It's your dog. You name him.
2654193 2656904 No. It's a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
2656988 2659782 Look, I don't know much about no dogs.
2659866 2661659 Well, you know, it ain't that complicated.
2661742 2666122 You pet him, you feed him,<br />and nature takes its course.
2666205 2668249 Don't you wanna name an animal?
2668332 2672336 Every guy should at one time try<br />to name an animal something.
2672920 2674297 I don't know. Fleabag?
2675089 2678885 It's catchy. It ain't original,<br />but it's pretty good.
2679427 2681971 I think, though, you could come up with,<br />in your young brain,
2682054 2684891 something better to throw out<br />than Fleabag.
2685725 2687560 Punchy. How's that?
2689145 2691022 -Punchy?<br />-Yeah, Punchy.
2691564 2694567 [tender music playing]
2695193 2697278 - I like it.<br />-For real?
2697361 2702158 For real. Punchy it is. It's easy<br />to remember, it's not that hard to spell,
2702825 2704869 and once it's in your brain,<br />you never forget it.
2704952 2706287 Punchy. Very good.
2706370 2707246 All right.
2707330 2708206 Good call.
2709165 2712418 All right, Punchy.<br />You ready to be bailed out, my friend?
2712501 2713461 Okay.
2714837 2717632 -Hey.<br />-Hey, you know it was a joke, don't you?
2717715 2720551 -Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.<br />-[laughs]
2721802 2724805 ["Una Furtiva Lagrima" playing]

2767682 2769225 Yo, Paulie.
2769308 2771769 They're gonna be talking about<br />that fake Looney Tune fight.
2772520 2775231 Come on. We're about<br />to serve today's special.
2775314 2778859 Italian food cooked up by<br />a bunch of Mexicans ain't so special.
2778943 2780111 Hey, yo.
2782196 2783906 Hey, I skipped work for this.
2787576 2789745 What an ugly dog.
2791539 2792999 It's a cute dog.
2795376 2796502 -Rock?<br />-Yeah?
2796585 2799797 I'm gonna take off, all right?<br />Hey, that stuff back there is pretty cool.
2799880 2801132 -You like that?<br />-Yeah.
2801215 2802675 Thanks. I appreciate it.
2802758 2805094 -I'm gonna catch you later.<br />-[Rocky] All right.
2810516 2811350 Who's the criminal?
2811434 2812685 He's a nice kid.
2812768 2814562 He dresses like a bum.
2814645 2817523 Oh. Coming from a human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.
2818983 2820609 Hide the silverware.
2820693 2821569 [Rocky] That's nice.
2824405 2825281 Hey, Spider.
2829952 2831704 Didn't you knock out that bum once?
2832538 2833956 Will you give it a rest?
2838461 2840463 [lively news theme plays on TV]
2844800 2848220 I'm gonna be late for work for this.<br />Give me a break.
2848804 2850806 All right. Just for a few seconds.
2851474 2855394 In the late '60s, a simulated fight<br />took place between two legends,
2855478 2859231 Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.<br />Marciano long retired,
2859315 2864236 and Ali, unable to fight legitimately for<br />three years for having refused induction
2864320 2866155 into the armed forces,<br />was in need of money,
2866238 2867948 and agreed to the so-called dream match,
2868032 2870659 whose outcome would be decided<br />by a computer.
2870743 2875539 It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano<br />won the much-disputed computer decision,
2875623 2878209 and guess what. Not much has changed.
2878292 2879835 [man] Last week, Rocky Balboa won...
2879919 2883589 See? That's the cartoon fight<br />I'm telling you about.
2883672 2884507 Yeah.
2885591 2889845 A stunning knockout. And keep in mind<br />this is taking the human factor out of it.
2889929 2892473 -The computer says Rocky Balboa...<br />-Whoa, that was beautiful.
2892556 2893557 ...would be triumphant.
2893641 2896477 KO 13, and here is some of the fallout.
2897103 2899397 What started as a simple form<br />of entertainment
2899480 2901107 has now become this rallying cry
2901190 2904777 for people who think an old-school athlete<br />like Balboa could actually be better.
2904860 2908489 So your computer technology has to create<br />what isn't. That's just not responsible.
2908572 2910241 Get therapy, will you?
2910825 2913327 Skip, how do you think Balboa<br />would have done against Dixon?
2913411 2916580 Badly. Personally I think Balboa<br />was completely overrated.
2916664 2919208 [host] You know, he owns<br />a little restaurant in South Philly.
2919291 2921460 [Skip]<br />What's the specialty, Pounded Chicken?
2921544 2924422 Anyway, I would have paid<br />to see the fight. Next topic, NASCAR,
2924505 2928759 and the controversy that won't go away.<br />Let's go back to Sunday's race...
2929468 2933973 Hey, cheer up. It's free advertisement.<br />Come on. Meat house calls.
2934056 2937059 [poignant music playing]
2944733 2945860 [Rocky] Yo, Robert.
2949113 2950990 What is this?<br />What are you doing out so late?
2951073 2953284 I tried calling,<br />but nothing was picking up.
2953367 2954201 Is something wrong?
2954285 2956912 No. I just wanted to come by<br />and see you in person.
2956996 2957872 Wanna come inside?
2957955 2960875 No. I just wanna get<br />your opinion on something.
2961459 2963127 Sure. On what?
2963210 2965463 They say you only go around once, right?
2965546 2966922 I've heard that.
2967006 2970342 Well, I think I wanna do something.
2970426 2971510 Like what?
2971594 2972636 Fight.
2974597 2977183 Nothing big. Small stuff, like locally...
2980019 2982771 Don't you think you're too, you know, old?
2983355 2985441 Think you should stop trying things
2985524 2987860 because you had a few<br />too many birthdays? I do not.
2987943 2989445 People will think you're crazy.
2989528 2993574 What's crazy about<br />standing toe-to-toe, saying "I am"?
2993657 2995367 That's just the ego talking.
2996785 2999538 What are you trying to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
3000581 3005294 Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking the way<br />other people think a long time ago.
3005377 3007213 You gotta think like you think.
3009048 3010090 I do.
3010174 3011926 Do you? Good.
3012843 3017515 You gotta face reality.<br />It's a different world now.
3018432 3020267 Only the clothes are different.
3022770 3025773 I really don't know what you want from me.
3026357 3030277 I just want us to get involved.<br />You know, like, home team.
3031153 3033155 [poignant music playing]
3033239 3038619 Look, whatever it is<br />you're going through, it will pass.
3039203 3040788 You're probably right.
3040871 3043499 Time is gonna catch up to all of us.
3043582 3047044 -Especially if you're standing still.<br />-Hey, come on.
3049463 3051465 Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.
3054969 3057555 -[Paulie] Did you tell this to your kid?<br />-[Rocky] Yeah, I did.
3057638 3059890 -[Paulie] He thinks you're nuts, right?<br />-[Rocky] Yeah.
3060224 3065479 Oh-ho-ho. He don't believe in you?<br />Welcome to my world, buddy.
3066188 3069483 Rocko, nobody's giving you no title shot.
3069567 3071819 I know that. I don't want one.
3071902 3074363 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
3075614 3076448 No.
3076991 3080160 You're mad because<br />they took down your statue?
3080744 3081662 No.
3081745 3083163 [laughs]
3083747 3084999 Not really.
3085082 3090379 If it's about money, just hang a sign<br />around your neck saying "Punch me."
3090462 3093424 Five dollars, you'll make big money.<br />[laughs]
3095259 3097553 What? You haven't peaked yet?
3098137 3098971 Peaked?
3099722 3100889 Yeah, peaked.
3101473 3103767 I don't know.<br />There's still some stuff in the basement.
3104893 3105728 What basement?
3106312 3107146 In here.
3108230 3110065 Tell me about the stuff.
3111442 3112276 What about it?
3112359 3116030 Tell me about the stuff inside.<br />Is it angry?
3116614 3117615 Angry?
3118157 3120034 Are you mad because Adrian left you?
3120117 3122453 She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
3122536 3124413 Okay. Okay.
3125789 3128792 [poignant music playing]
3128876 3132504 [sobs] You know,<br />sometimes it's hard to breathe.
3133047 3135841 I feel this beast inside me.
3136800 3139553 It's okay, Rocko. It's okay.
3139637 3142389 Is it okay?
3148604 3151857 I just never knew<br />it was supposed to be this hard.
3152441 3154860 It wasn't supposed to be like this.<br />You know it.
3157154 3158238 [sighs]
3165245 3167373 You wanna come by and help me train?
3167456 3168957 I got a job here.
3169541 3170501 I understand.
3171251 3175756 Remember you said if you stay one place<br />long enough you become that place?
3176632 3178717 This is all I've got.
3179301 3180886 I understand.
3186392 3190270 If you get time and come down<br />and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
3191397 3192690 Of course.
3196485 3197403 Bye, Paulie.
3198696 3199613 Goodbye, Rocko.
3203075 3204368 Take care.
3210582 3214253 [commissioner] This plenary session<br />of the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission
3214336 3219425 is convened in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa
3220050 3224388 for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing license
3224471 3229101 due to his ineligibility<br />to be licensed as a matter of right.
3229184 3233230 Mr. Balboa, you are welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself,
3233313 3236525 we invite you to make<br />an opening statement, if you'd like to.
3236608 3239528 I was just curious how I did, that's all.
3239611 3244158 All right, well,<br />the Medical Advisory Board has informed us
3244241 3247077 that the battery of tests<br />to which you've been subjected,
3247161 3250080 you've passed these tests<br />with flying colors.
3250831 3252791 And we congratulate you for that.
3253584 3255252 -Thanks.<br />-However,
3255335 3260299 this commission, in good conscience,<br />cannot recommend you for a license,
3260883 3263302 and we therefore deny your application.
3265471 3267097 Didn't I do what you asked?
3267181 3268056 Yes, you did.
3268140 3269892 So I should get a license, right?
3270476 3271435 Not exactly.
3274521 3277775 So why did you give me all them tests<br />if you was never passing me?
3278317 3280694 We've got to stand by our decision
3280778 3283655 and deny your request<br />for a license at this time.
3283739 3286742 [wistful music playing]
3296084 3297878 Don't I got some rights?
3298504 3301006 [commissioner] What rights<br />do you think you're referring to?
3301089 3303634 Like in that official paper<br />they wrote down the street there?
3303717 3305969 -That's the Bill of Rights.<br />-Yeah, the Bill of Rights.
3306053 3308722 Don't it say something about<br />going after what makes you happy?
3308806 3311391 No, that's "the pursuit of happiness.”<br />But what is your point?
3311475 3314520 My point is I'm pursuing something,<br />and nobody looks too happy about it.
3314603 3317189 But we're just looking<br />after your interests.
3317272 3318106 I appreciate that,
3318190 3321276 but maybe you're looking out<br />for your interests a little bit more.
3321360 3322653 You shouldn't be asking people
3322736 3324863 to come down here<br />and pay the freight on something.
3324947 3328116 They pay. They still ain't good enough.<br />You think that's right?
3328200 3331286 Maybe you're doing your job, but why<br />do you gotta stop me from doing mine?
3332120 3334498 Because if you're willing<br />to go through all the battling
3334581 3335916 to get where you want to get,
3335999 3337918 who's got the right to stop you?
3338001 3340295 Maybe you have something<br />you never finished,
3340379 3341755 something you really want to do,
3341839 3343841 something you never said to somebody,<br />something.
3343924 3346051 And you're told no,<br />even after you pay your dues.
3346134 3348929 Who's got the right<br />to tell you that? Nobody.
3349012 3352182 It's your right to listen to your gut.<br />It ain't nobody's right to say no,
3352266 3355602 after you earn the right to be what<br />you want to be, or do what you want to do.
3360023 3363777 The older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.
3364319 3368282 The only thing I'm asking you<br />to leave on the table is what's right.
3386049 3388176 -Yo!<br />-Have you seen the paper today?
3388260 3390178 Front row. Front row.
3390262 3392598 [man] That is so great.
3392681 3393557 All right...
3393640 3395893 Let's go get some food. Food.
3395976 3397644 Come on. Come on.
3397728 3398854 -Rob, come on.<br />-Hey.
3399688 3401857 [Lou] The last two pay-per-views<br />were in the toilet.
3401940 3404735 Nobody cares. You're not making<br />heavyweight championship money.
3404818 3407446 There's a bunch of nobodies out there.<br />This is the bottom line.
3407529 3410741 But I wanna talk about an interesting<br />opportunity we should run with.
3410824 3413952 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a license and got one?
3414036 3415287 I heard. Forget about him.
3415370 3417122 -No, hear me out.<br />-Hear what out?
3417205 3420125 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands behind my back?
3420208 3423295 You could beat the guy sitting down.<br />But that's not what it's about.
3423378 3426715 It's about making money. We gotta<br />capitalize on that computer fight.
3426798 3429426 This could do a million buys.<br />That's 15, 20 million to you.
3429509 3430928 -Forget it.<br />-What do you wanna do?
3431011 3432721 No one wants to watch you fight anymore.
3432804 3434431 We got guaranteed fights.
3434514 3437559 We don't. You wanna do this<br />in front of your friends, we'll do it now.
3437643 3441438 We got nothing. All the pay-per-view<br />fights you came up with got rejected.
3441521 3444942 You know why? They're all bums out there.<br />Nobody cares about them.
3445025 3449071 There's no marquee value.<br />But this Balboa thing is interesting.
3449154 3451073 -I don't wanna do it.<br />-Listen to me.
3451156 3454993 It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.<br />Call it nostalgia or whatever you want,
3455077 3458372 but people can relate to that stuff.<br />This is a no-lose for everybody.
3458455 3459665 -It's all good.<br />-For who?
3459748 3461458 For you. Not for me.
3461541 3464920 Maybe you don't understand.<br />People don't like you anymore.
3465003 3467130 They don't follow you,<br />don't support you anymore.
3467214 3470676 Understand? Don't look at me<br />like I'm messing with your legacy.
3470759 3473053 Every jock now thinks<br />they've got a legacy.
3473136 3475639 A legacy is what you get<br />instead of getting paid.
3475722 3478392 -Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />-I'm not no more.
3478475 3482104 [Lou] Mason. Everybody knows you could<br />kick this old man's ass. But you don't.
3482187 3484523 You leave him with a little bit<br />of dignity, so they say,
3484606 3488151 "Mason Dixon's got compassion.<br />He's a decent guy, a nice guy."
3488235 3490988 You get a new audience,<br />we'll double your money on the next fight.
3491071 3492781 Want a new image? That's how you get it.
3492864 3495033 What you mean?<br />To replace the one that you two made?
3495117 3497703 Whoa, wait. We made your world green.<br />You made the rest.
3497786 3499830 You made all this junk happen.
3499913 3501790 I've had it up to here<br />with this mess, man.
3501873 3505043 It's time for me to make some changes.<br />I'm going back to Martin's gym.
3505127 3506336 We'll talk about this crap.
3506420 3508797 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.
3519599 3521476 -How you doing?<br />-Hey, what a surprise.
3521560 3524146 I was just driving around the neighborhood<br />and I thought,
3524229 3526648 -"Why not drive by and say hello?"<br />-You wanna come inside?
3526732 3530360 No, the dog needs some exercise.<br />You wanna take a little walk?
3530444 3532571 -Yeah. All right.<br />-It's nice outside.
3532654 3533655 All right.
3533739 3535365 Nice and brisk.
3535449 3536616 When did you get a dog?
3536700 3539036 Uh, we picked up Punchy<br />a couple of days ago.
3539119 3540203 -Punchy?<br />-Yeah.
3540287 3541830 You named your dog Punchy?
3541913 3543749 Actually, your kid came up with the name.
3543832 3546251 Yeah? I think that's disrespectful.
3546334 3551590 Oh, no. It's fine. Really.<br />It's easy to remember and all that.
3551673 3554843 Listen, what do you think<br />about coming over to the restaurant?
3554926 3555761 What for?
3555844 3558722 You know, for work.
3558805 3561433 The hostess is gonna be having a kid.<br />You'd do good.
3561516 3562350 I don't know.
3562434 3564436 I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
3564519 3566980 I appreciate what you're doing<br />for my kid, but I can't.
3567064 3569608 You know, I think you'd like it a lot.
3569691 3572235 It's a nice environment,<br />it's very pleasant.
3572319 3573361 Can we drop it?
3576782 3578408 What's bothering you?
3578492 3580660 Nothing. It's all right.<br />Listen, I gotta get back.
3582204 3583997 -No, it ain't all right.<br />-Come on.
3584081 3584998 What?
3585082 3587334 I'd be the first person<br />people see when they walk in?
3587417 3591713 You just give out menus,<br />say "Hello, how are you?" Sit people down.
3591797 3594174 Look, Little Marie,<br />if I can do it, anybody can do it.
3594257 3597761 You could find ten better people,<br />a hundred better people for this job.
3597844 3599596 Give it a try, like two weeks.
3599679 3601223 I don't wanna try.
3601932 3604226 -Who put this stuff in your head?<br />-Nobody.
3604309 3606186 Well, it don't get in there by itself.
3609815 3611066 Thanks for coming by.
3611858 3613568 [poignant music playing]
3613652 3616196 Yo. When was the last time<br />you went dancing?
3616279 3618990 -Has it been a while?<br />-Why are you asking me that?
3619074 3621618 I'm asking because you're dancing<br />around all these problems,
3621701 3624412 you might as well come and dance<br />with me. Now, I ain't that good,
3624496 3626998 but I'm probably better than<br />the average bear.
3627082 3629000 Where that came from, I don't know.
3630168 3631002 You're crazy.
3631086 3635132 A little bit. But the way you're thinking<br />and talking, it's a little crazy too.
3636258 3639845 Come on. You deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
3639928 3643306 I need you to class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
3644558 3648061 And if you say "Screw you, creepo” again,<br />I totally understand.
3648145 3652691 But I'm warning you, I'm gonna put myself<br />geographically in the middle of the street
3652774 3655986 and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />and wave to the first bus, and say,
3656069 3657696 "Come on over here and mash me.
3657779 3660532 Because Little Marie turned down<br />the job at the restaurant.
3660615 3662576 She thinks she's better than us.”
3662659 3665662 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
3666371 3668290 -Yeah?
3669666 3672002 Whew. That was a close call.
3673170 3677507 Listen, seriously. Come on over.<br />It would be nice.
3680844 3681678 All right.
3700447 3701281 [man] Paulie.
3705327 3706203 Sorry, Paulie.
3708538 3709372 Sorry...
3709456 3712459 [poignant music playing]
3736149 3738151 [indistinct chatter]
3741488 3744115 How are you? Get my unusual up there.
3744658 3747702 Excuse me. Deliveries are in the back.
3747786 3749579 I'm not a delivery guy.
3749663 3751206 Do you have a reservation?
3751748 3754709 Do I look like a freaking Indian? [laughs]
3757545 3758755 Hey, Rocky?
3764302 3767347 I think we've got a little bit<br />of a problem with this guy.
3767430 3769849 Problem? No, he's just a relative.
3769933 3771268 Oh, okay.
3775063 3776147 Yo, Paulie.
3778441 3780402 -What happened to your eye?<br />- I hit it.
3780485 3782529 -Why?<br />-Needed to.
3783280 3784447 What happened?
3784531 3786908 -I'm celebrating.<br />-Why?
3787659 3788493 I retired.
3789160 3789995 Retired?
3790078 3792080 -[laughs]<br />-Yeah?
3796084 3799921 When did they start giving retired people<br />meat instead of watches?
3803717 3805051 I don't need a watch.
3807262 3808596 I got a watch.
3809389 3810765 You gave me a watch.
3810849 3811683 Paulie.
3812517 3814227 [Paulie] I don't need a goddamn watch.
3816688 3819107 -Yo, Paulie.<br />-I got a watch.
3821151 3823028 I got two watches.
3823611 3824821 Yo, Paulie.
3833705 3835707 [siren wailing distantly]
3848803 3850180 Yo, Paulie.
3853933 3855185 Thirty-one years.
3858855 3860440 I gave them 31 years.
3862984 3866279 [sobs] 31 years freezing. For what?
3868323 3869324 It stinks!
3869949 3871368 My life stinks.
3871993 3873995 [sobbing]
3874579 3876664 What have I done?
3877874 3880001 Nothing, Rocko, nothing.
3881169 3883838 Why didn't I die instead of my sister?
3885298 3889677 I miss my sister, Rocko. I miss her.
3890261 3893348 - I really miss her. [sobbing]<br />-[poignant music playing]
3893431 3896434 Why am I here?
3897227 3898353 And she's not?
3899187 3901606 She never hurt nobody, Rocko.
3902524 3903691 I know.
3904401 3906152 She was all I had, Rocko.
3909614 3912450 Now you're all I have.
3913993 3915703 And you never let me down.
3916287 3918915 And I treat you bad too.
3918998 3921000 [sobbing continues]
3922669 3925213 Why do I do that, Rocko?
3932887 3934180 Hey, hey, hey.
3937600 3939853 You're still my best friend, Paulie.
3939936 3941479 -Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
3941563 3943940 My very crazy best friend.
3944023 3947610 What am I gonna do now, Rocko?
3948445 3949571 What do you wanna do?
3951698 3953741 Can I move back in the house?
3953825 3956161 Sure. But what about your girlfriend?
3957745 3962208 If I'm going to be lonely,<br />I'd rather be lonely with you.
3963626 3966004 And she snores.
3966087 3967422 [both laugh]
3975555 3978141 Yeah, it'd be great if you move back in.
3978725 3981436 -Okay, I appreciate this, Rocko.<br />-Sure.
3982437 3983646 So do I.
3986357 3988151 Here, let me help you with this stuff.
3989110 3991446 -Thank you.<br />-Yeah, you're welcome.
3991529 3994866 -Thank you. [sobs]<br />-Hey, it's good to have you back.
3994949 3996784 I missed you. I missed you.
3999871 4002040 -See you back at the house.<br />-Okay.
4008004 4008838 Hey, Rock.
4009422 4010256 Yeah.
4010924 4015386 It takes guts climbing back in that ring,<br />knowing you're gonna take a beating.
4016221 4017222 Thanks, Paulie.
4018556 4019390 Yo, Rock.
4020934 4022602 You're gonna do all right.
4023561 4025313 How do you know that?
4027482 4030360 The stuff in the basement. [laughs]
4041204 4042205 Thanks, Paulie.
4045542 4049379 -[speaking indistinctly]<br />-Great. Good.
4050922 4053049 -Yo.<br />-Good. Hey, how you doing?
4053132 4055552 Pretty good. You know,<br />Paulie's moving back in. It's very nice.
4055635 4057554 -Really? That's good.<br />-Yeah. Thanks.
4057637 4060473 Listen, there's a couple guys over there<br />wanna talk to you.
4060557 4063601 -I'll check it out. Enjoy.<br />-Okay.
4067438 4070066 -Thanks for coming. I appreciate it.<br />-No problem. Our pleasure.
4070149 4071359 You wanna hear some stories?
4071442 4072860 [Lou] What kind of stories?
4072944 4075405 Well, a lot of people<br />like to hear these old fight stories.
4075488 4077365 -[Lou] Maybe later.<br />-Okay.
4077448 4080910 I'm Lou DiBella. This is Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixon's manager.
4081536 4084038 -Will you sit down and join us? Please.<br />-Sure.
4085957 4088668 You know, we have the promotional<br />contract for Mason Dixon.
4088751 4090336 -Who's a big fan, by the way.<br />-Really?
4090420 4092755 And when he heard<br />you were interested in fighting again,
4092839 4095133 he thought, why not try<br />and work something out?
4095216 4098052 Like a special event.<br />A first-class exhibition fight.
4099512 4100346 Why me?
4100430 4103099 He respects the hell out of you.<br />All right? And let's be honest.
4103182 4107312 That computer fight got people curious.<br />This could be very interesting.
4107395 4110690 I ain't interested in getting mangled<br />and embarrassed.
4110773 4113026 That's not gonna happen. Never happen.
4113109 4119741 Truthfully, I was thinking more<br />on a miniscule small level.
4119824 4121409 Small fights, not big fights.
4121492 4122994 Small fights.
4123953 4126623 -Local. You know what I mean?<br />-[L.C.] Not a bad idea.
4126706 4129584 But don't think of it as big.<br />Think of it like I said, an exhibition.
4129667 4131502 Think of it<br />as a glorified sparring session.
4131586 4133171 Here's something I think you'll like.
4133254 4135632 We're gonna donate a portion<br />of the gate to charity.
4136174 4137050 That's always nice.
4137133 4138843 -It's good to give.<br />-[Rocky] Yeah.
4140136 4141679 Where's it, uh, taking place?
4141763 4143181 -Las Vegas.<br />-Las Vegas.
4143264 4145516 Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killing you.
4146809 4147644 Bit stiff.
4147727 4149812 You move better when you're warmer,<br />you know that?
4149896 4151522 -Yeah.<br />-And if nothing else,
4151606 4153274 you'll have new stories to tell.
4154067 4155818 I really gotta think about this.
4155902 4157695 -[Lou] Absolutely.<br />-Is that okay?
4157779 4159322 -Understand. No problem.<br />-No problem.
4159405 4161908 I'm gonna go over there.<br />You guys can order something.
4161991 4164202 -What do you recommend?<br />-It's all edible.
4164285 4165203 [laughs]
4167038 4168956 Okay. Thanks.
4170416 4174295 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime?
4174379 4175922 -He'd kill him.<br />-You ain't kidding.
4177382 4179092 Man, I'm confused...
4179175 4181177 [whispering indistinctly]
4186683 4188726 [Rocky]<br />I didn't think this was gonna come along.
4188810 4190603 [Marie]<br />But this is what you wanted, right?
4190687 4191604 [Rocky] I don't know.
4191688 4195400 I talk and I talk, and sometimes I think<br />what I'm saying is true
4195483 4199946 and then I look at myself<br />and I'm not even sure what's true anymore.
4200029 4204492 I push this crazy idea about fighting...<br />What's it all about?
4205034 4207912 Do I really care about standing toe-to-toe<br />and all that stuff,
4207995 4211791 or like my kid says, is it just ego?
4211874 4215753 Or am I this old pug who's just trying<br />to replace old pain with new pain?
4215837 4218339 I don't know.
4220133 4222510 Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.
4223177 4226139 I'm always listening and looking.
4227432 4232270 But who you are,<br />the part of you that's so full of life...
4232353 4236899 We all have that feeling, that fire,<br />but usually never get a chance to use it.
4236983 4238359 Then it just goes away.
4239360 4243114 But you can.<br />You've got this opportunity, so do it.
4243197 4244449 Why not?
4244532 4248077 This is who you are.<br />This is who you'll always be.
4248745 4252415 And you don't move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.
4252498 4255334 It doesn't matter how this looks<br />to other people.
4255418 4257587 All that matters is how it looks to you.
4257670 4259046 [dramatic music playing]
4259797 4260631 Rocky.
4262300 4263301 Look at me.
4265845 4269056 How it looks to you.
4270141 4272268 And if this is something<br />that you wanna do,
4272351 4275980 and if this is something that<br />you've gotta do, then you do it.
4277815 4278983 Fighters fight.
4283237 4285740 -You're not gonna punch me, are you?<br />-[laughs]
4285823 4286824 [laughs]
4289076 4292747 I gotta go before I wear out my welcome.<br />I'll see you tomorrow.
4294415 4295458 Thanks.
4306469 4307804 Fighters fight, right?
4311724 4314685 [dramatic music continues]
4314769 4318105 [Lou] It's rare when you get to promote<br />an event that's bigger than boxing.
4318189 4319023 This is.
4319106 4322985 Skill versus will, with part<br />of the proceeds going to charity.
4323069 4327323 The brainchild of Mason Dixon,<br />to honor past heavyweight champions.
4327406 4330743 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
4330827 4331828 [reporters clamoring]
4331911 4334539 [woman 1] Rocky, a few great fighters<br />have fought in their 50s,
4334622 4336290 often with disastrous results.
4336374 4338000 Why risk the danger and embarrassment?
4338084 4340795 The smart money says<br />you have virtually no chance.
4340878 4343005 A puncher always has a chance.
4343673 4345341 This fight will be competitive.
4346050 4347844 [woman 2] Why are you doing this, Rocky?
4348386 4352682 I don't know, I'd rather do something<br />I love badly than...
4352765 4356727 [Paulie] Than to feel bad<br />by not doing something you love.
4358145 4360773 [man 1] Rocky, the press has labeled you<br />a "Balboasaurus."
4360857 4362483 [reporters laughing]
4362567 4364277 How do you feel about that?
4364360 4366404 [man 2]<br />Mason, let's say the following happens:
4366487 4368614 You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
4368698 4372326 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
4372410 4375872 You all know that will never happen.<br />This is only an exhibition.
4375955 4379458 Don't go trying to make more out of this<br />than that computer did. Okay?
4379542 4381460 [reporters clamoring]
4381544 4384755 [man 3] Isn't this sport in enough trouble<br />without these circus events?
4384839 4385923 Next question.
4386007 4389093 [woman 1] On the surface this looks like<br />a cheap bit of ring theater
4389176 4390928 between, no offense, a has-been
4391012 4394473 and a man whose own credible legacy<br />and popularity is in doubt.
4394557 4396225 -What's the upside?<br />-Doubt?
4396309 4400271 Upside? What do you mean, upside?
4400354 4401939 What do I have to do?
4404108 4406110 I'm 33-and-0 with 30 knockouts.
4406193 4409488 I'm doing you people a favor.<br />I'm having this exhibition for you.
4409572 4411616 And you're gonna make a mockery out of me?
4411699 4412533 I'm the champ.
4413117 4415328 If I get pissed, this guy gets hurt.
4416370 4417955 See you at the fight.
4418039 4420041 [reporters clamoring]
4422168 4424337 The guy is a joke. He's gonna get crushed.
4424420 4425838 [customers chattering]
4433471 4435056 Oh, look who's here.
4435139 4437350 How you doing, Uncle Paulie?<br />Have you seen my father?
4437433 4438267 In the back.
4439310 4441228 [speaking indistinctly]
4447860 4448694 Excuse me.
4450988 4454533 How you doing? Glad you came by.
4455284 4456202 Can I talk with you?
4456285 4458996 -Sure.<br />-Can we do it outside?
4463834 4465169 You're going through with this?
4465252 4467672 - I start training tomorrow.<br />-Hey, Rock.
4468547 4472635 I made some connections. I can make<br />some money on this, endorsements.
4473970 4475554 Absolutely. Do that.
4475638 4477098 -Thank you.<br />-Sure.
4478724 4480351 So you nervous about the fight?
4480434 4482061 Scared to death.
4482144 4483145 You don't look scared.
4483229 4484522 I ain't supposed to.
4485106 4487024 Then you don't have to do it.
4487650 4489193 I think I do.
4493030 4497576 You know, living with you<br />hasn't been easy. People see me,
4497660 4501956 but they think of you. With all this<br />going on, it's gonna be worse than ever.
4502039 4504041 -It don't have to be.<br />-Sure, it does.
4504125 4505918 Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.
4506002 4509046 What, my last name?<br />That's the reason I got a decent job.
4509130 4511465 That's why people deal with me<br />in the first place.
4511549 4513592 Now I start to get a little ahead,
4513676 4517346 to get a little something for myself,<br />and this happens.
4517430 4521267 I'm asking you as a favor<br />not to go through with this. Okay?
4521350 4524145 This is gonna end up bad for you,<br />and it's gonna end up bad for me.
4524228 4525479 You think I'm hurting you?
4525563 4527064 In a way, you are.
4527148 4529233 That's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
4529316 4532862 I know that's not what you wanna do,<br />but that's just the way that it is.
4532945 4535781 Don't you care what people think?<br />Doesn't it bother you that
4535865 4539368 people are making you out to be a joke,<br />and that I'll be included in that?
4539452 4542580 Do you think that's right? Do you?
4548627 4550421 You ain't gonna believe this.
4551297 4553132 But you used to fit right here.
4553758 4556010 I'd hold you up and say to your mother,
4556093 4558888 "This kid is gonna be<br />the best kid in the world.
4558971 4561849 This kid is gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew."
4562516 4565269 And you grew up good and wonderful.
4565352 4568564 It was great just watching,<br />every day was like a privilege.
4568647 4571776 Then the time came for you to be<br />your own man and take on the world,
4571859 4572693 and you did.
4572777 4577948 But somewhere along the line,<br />you changed. You stopped being you.
4578032 4581577 You let people stick a finger in your face<br />and tell you you're no good.
4581660 4585331 And when things got hard, you started<br />looking for something to blame,
4585414 4586707 like a big shadow.
4588584 4591170 Let me tell you something<br />you already know.
4591253 4593839 The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
4593923 4597927 It's a very mean and nasty place.<br />And I don't care how tough you are,
4598010 4600971 it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there permanently
4601055 4602056 if you let it.
4602139 4605976 Nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.
4606519 4610731 But it ain't about how hard you hit.<br />It's about how hard you can get hit
4610815 4612233 and keep moving forward.
4612316 4615569 How much you can take,<br />and keep moving forward.
4615653 4617279 That's how winning is done.
4618489 4621367 If you know what you're worth,<br />then go out and get what you're worth.
4621450 4624703 But you gotta be willing to take the hits.<br />And not pointing fingers,
4624787 4629041 saying you aren't where you want to be<br />because of him or her, or anybody.
4629125 4632795 Cowards do that, and that ain't you.<br />You're better than that.
4633337 4635840 [poignant music playing]
4640052 4644890 I'm always gonna love you,<br />no matter what happens.
4645850 4647852 You're my son and you're my blood.
4648894 4650896 You're the best thing in my life.
4652731 4656569 But until you start believing in yourself,<br />you ain't gonna have a life.
4661490 4663492 Don't forget to visit your mother.
4682469 4684471 [music fades]
4701322 4703199 [Duke]<br />Throw the hook! Transfer the weight!
4703949 4705659 Come on, don't wait on him.
4706994 4709163 Come on, no waiting too long.
4709246 4710915 -Throw that hook.<br />-[Rocky grunts]
4710998 4712249 Come on, throw that hook!
4713292 4714376 Shift that weight.
4716712 4720466 Shift the weight.<br />Come on, let's see that hook.
4722259 4725346 Don't wait too long. Don't wait.
4725429 4727932 Get off first. Come on, get off, Rock!
4729183 4730017 Throw the hook!
4730851 4731852 Time.
4734021 4735856 All right, that's it.
4739318 4740611 Shower up, baby, shower up.
4740694 4744406 -[poignant music playing]<br />-I... I lost my balance in there.
4744490 4747451 - I don't know if this was a good idea.<br />-Rock?
4747534 4750037 The dog could do better<br />than I'm doing right now.
4750120 4752748 [Paulie] You're a little rusty.<br />First time back, huh?
4752831 4755209 Can't expect the big bomb so early.
4756627 4758671 Duke got some ideas for you tomorrow.
4758754 4762800 -What ideas?<br />-Good bright ideas. New way of thinking.
4762883 4764343 Go ahead, shower up, okay?
4764426 4765594 You look good, Rock.
4765678 4766679 Thanks.
4768472 4769848 Paulie, what's his problem?
4769932 4772559 He's thinking rather than doing.
4772643 4775229 And you're probably making him rusty.
4775312 4778148 Sure, Paulie.<br />Hey, whatever you're thinking is wrong.
4778232 4779692 -Oh, you think so?<br />-Yeah.
4808429 4811432 [poignant music playing]
4814643 4816520 -Those are beautiful.<br />-Yeah.
4819189 4820899 You get off early from work?
4820983 4825487 No. I left. I quit.
4827156 4828365 Quit, why?
4829908 4831410 I wasn't very...
4832870 4835914 I just didn't fit in there.
4838125 4839335 I understand.
4844298 4846550 -So, what are you gonna do?<br />-Right now?
4848927 4850888 Right now I'd rather be with you.
4853807 4854892 Is that all right?
4856977 4857811 Yeah.
4859063 4861398 It's been a long time<br />since I've seen a fight.
4873744 4877247 [Duke] You know all there is to know<br />about fighting, so there's no sense
4877331 4879291 going down that same road again.
4879375 4883587 To beat this guy, you need speed.<br />You don't have it.
4883670 4885255 [dramatic music playing]
4885339 4889093 And your knees can't take the pounding.<br />So hard running is out.
4889176 4891136 And you've got arthritis in your neck.
4891220 4893055 And you've got calcium deposits
4893138 4896350 on most of your joints.<br />So sparring is out.
4897434 4898811 I had that problem.
4899686 4904858 So, what we'll be calling on is<br />good old-fashioned blunt force trauma.
4904942 4909822 Horsepower. Heavy duty, cast-iron,<br />pile-driving punches
4909905 4913534 that will have to hurt so much<br />they'll rattle his ancestors.
4913617 4915786 Every time you hit him with a shot,
4915869 4918372 it's got to feel like<br />he tried kissing the express train.
4918455 4919790 [neck cracks]
4919873 4923627 Yeah. Let's start building<br />some hurting bombs.

5099845 5102139 Thank you very much.<br />I appreciate it, champ. Thanks.
5106768 5109354 [crowd chanting] Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...
5119364 5121491 -You know how much money is in this?<br />-A lot of it.
5121575 5124036 Imagine trying to clean this place.
5124119 5125495 -No, seriously.<br />-Balboa.
5129207 5133545 I'll catch up with you guys later, okay?<br />Robert, hang with me.
5135714 5137633 -How you doing, champ?<br />-I'm good.
5139968 5142512 There's no reason for either of us<br />to get hurt in this fight.
5142596 5147142 I'll do my best to carry you, make sure<br />you save face. It'd be no embarrassment.
5147726 5152189 But I promise you, you try to press me,<br />you hit me, you hurt me,
5152272 5155859 you hit me low, cheap-shot me,<br />I'll get you out of there.
5157319 5161490 You know, uh, a lot of people<br />come to Vegas to lose, but I didn't.
5161573 5162949 It's already over.
5163033 5165035 Ain't nothing over till it's over.
5165118 5166870 What's that from, the '80s?
5166953 5168955 That's probably the "70s.
5172376 5173794 Just remember what I said.
5175379 5176546 Yo. Champ.
5177464 5179257 Ain't you a little scared?
5180258 5181385 I don't get scared.
5182928 5185055 -[woman] This way. Thank you.<br />-[man] One more time.
5185138 5188100 I think you try<br />a little harder when you're scared.
5188183 5191353 This is, uh, what has worked for me.
5192104 5192938 Scared, huh?
5193021 5196066 Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?<br />Come on, let's see what you got.

5217170 5219047 I was just thinking.<br />Did you wanna come in?
5219131 5222843 No. It's okay. I just wanted to
5222926 5225804 come by and wish you<br />good luck for tomorrow.
5225887 5227180 -Thanks.<br />-Yeah.
5227889 5230600 I brought you something.<br />I hope you don't mind,
5230684 5232477 I took it from the restaurant.
5234521 5236398 -Adrian.<br />-[poignant music playing]

5244406 5245240 Yeah.

5246950 5249369 for everything you've done<br />for me and my kid.
5250370 5252038 You've been great and, uh...
5256501 5257669 tomorrow,
5260005 5263550 you're going to prove that the last thing<br />to age in somebody is their heart.
5265927 5266970 I'll try.
5267053 5268180 You go show them.
5268263 5269097 Thank you.
5291077 5292746 [man] The heavyweight championship
5292829 5296666 has been one of sports'<br />most coveted titles for 120 years.
5296750 5300837 Two-time heavyweight champion<br />Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia slugger,
5300921 5305592 renowned for his cast-iron jaw,<br />ferocious body attack, and will of steel,
5306176 5309221 all of which have carried the much<br />smaller fighter to numerous victories
5309304 5312682 over the years against<br />physically superior opponents.
5312766 5315602 And Mason Dixon,<br />the current heavyweight titleholder
5315685 5318897 with all the speed, determination,<br />and confidence any fighter could want.
5318980 5323068 But many still question whether<br />he has the heart of a true champion,
5323151 5326947 never having been pushed<br />to go the distance. Tonight we find out.
5328031 5331243 Here at the Mandalay Bay Events Center<br />in Las Vegas, Nevada,
5331326 5333286 for the much-anticipated showdown
5333370 5338291 between Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
5338917 5341711 Hello, again. I'm Jim Lampley<br />with Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman
5342170 5344923 live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel<br />in Las Vegas, where we anticipate
5345006 5348552 one of the most outrageous<br />and compelling events in boxing history.
5348635 5352430 The current unappreciated heavyweight<br />champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon,
5352514 5354516 putting his reputation on the line
5354599 5358478 against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion,<br />Rocky Balboa.
5358562 5362649 Even though most see this<br />as more of a glorified sparring session,
5362732 5366444 the energy in the room is electric. Larry,<br />why is this billed as an exhibition?
5366528 5370490 Wild guess, so they wouldn't<br />have to call it an execution.
5371408 5376705 <i>Zachariah 46 says,<br />"I is not by strength, not by might,</i>
5376788 5380667 but by his spirit,<br />we have already claimed the victory
5380750 5382878 in our Lord Jesus Christ."
5384045 5385714 Good luck, Rocky.
5385797 5388133 Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.
5399436 5400937 Nobody's expecting much
5401021 5404733 from the way-past-his-prime<br />former champ, Rocky Balboa.
5405317 5407861 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
5409362 5414409 Look, I know you got a lot of stuff<br />you gotta get out of your system.
5414492 5415327 Huh?
5416119 5420749 Tonight you do it. Right?<br />Get rid of the damn beast,
5420832 5424878 let it be done, once and for all.<br />Please, I love you.
5425545 5428214 [crowd chanting] Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.
5428298 5431051 Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.
5431134 5434054 Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...
5434804 5438808 There go the lights. The buzz is building<br />toward a roaring crescendo.

5451529 5453865 # Next time you're found<br />With your chin on the ground #

5455408 5456910 Where did that come from?
5457661 5460622 I told you. I love Sinatra.
5461289 5462707 He's very good, Sinatra.
5463541 5464626 [Robert] Let's go.
5464709 5465543 Very good.
5465627 5468546 # Think he'll move<br />That rubber tree plant... #
5468630 5473301 [Larry] And here comes Rocky Balboa,<br />veteran of the wars,
5473385 5476221 here for one more last hurrah.
5476304 5479349 [Jim] Or the Last Supper, perhaps,<br />with him as the main course.
5479432 5482227 What's that music? You can't be serious.
5482310 5485021 [Larry]<br />"High Hopes"? Talk about wishful thinking.
5485105 5488566 Well, maybe no hopes is more realistic.<br />Anyway, the crowd likes it.
5489401 5492779 [Max] Look at the Italian Stallion.<br />Cool and relaxed.
5492862 5496574 [Jim] Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,<br />and they don't care at all.
5496658 5500662 [Max] This is about his pride and dignity<br />and his punch, guys.
5500745 5506292 The last thing to go is a guy's punch.<br />Rocky always has that puncher's chance.
5508545 5509713 [song ends]
5509796 5511047 [cheering]
5511131 5515301 [Jim] Rocky Balboa is still,<br />as you can hear, the people's champion.
5515385 5518513 [Max]<br />Prediction, guys, for at least two rounds,
5518596 5520181 Dixon's going to have his hands full.
5520265 5524060 [Larry] Two whole rounds?<br />We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.
5524978 5525812 How you doing?
5525895 5528398 The crowd wants to see<br />something real, or at least...
5528481 5531443 Rocky Balboa just asked me how I'm doing.
5531526 5533361 I grew up watching this guy.
5533445 5536322 I never thought<br />I'd be calling one of his fights.
5536406 5538867 This is unbelievable.<br />I'm a fan. I can't help it.

5585371 5587957 You can't call the shots. I'm the champ.

5602639 5606101 Resort and Casino of Las Vegas,
5606184 5609896 and a special main event of the evening,
5609979 5613191 ten rounds of heavyweight excitement.
5613274 5615985 Sanctioned by<br />the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
5616069 5621407 And when the bell rings, the referee<br />in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
5621491 5626579 And now for the thousands in attendance<br />and the millions watching
5626663 5630792 around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

5638842 5642137 Introducing first,<br />fighting out of the blue corner,

5647183 5651813 His professional record,<br />57 victories including 54 knockouts,
5651896 5655024 with 23 defeats and one draw.
5655108 5658444 He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,
5658528 5662949 the two-time heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
5663032 5665201 "The Italian Stallion,"
5665285 5670206 Rocky
5670290 5672417 Balboa.
5673001 5675253 -Rocky!<br />-We love you, Rocky!
5675336 5677005 Hope he gets his head busted.
5679174 5680341 Shut up.
5684012 5686848 [Michael] Across the ring,<br />fighting out of the red corner,
5686931 5691019 wearing white with blue,<br />official weight, 221 pounds.
5691102 5695940 He has a perfect professional record,<br />consisting of 33 bouts,
5696024 5699360 33 victories, including 30 knockouts.
5699444 5704782 Originally from Tampa, Florida,<br />but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,
5704866 5709245 the reigning undisputed, undefeated,
5709329 5712540 heavyweight champion of the world,
5712624 5716044 Mason "The Line"
5716127 5720131 Dixon.
5720215 5721257 [inaudible dialogue]
5724219 5725470 [Joe] All right, gentlemen.
5726095 5729599 All right, Mason, Rocky. We went over<br />the rules in the dressing room.
5729682 5733728 I expect a good, clean fight.<br />Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,
5733811 5735897 those low blows,<br />be careful with those, all right?
5735980 5737482 Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
5737565 5740818 Remember, gentlemen,<br />I'm fair, but I'm firm. Touch them up.
5740902 5741736 Enjoy the ride.
5741819 5745073 [Jim] The champ's not in the best shape<br />we've seen him in. Maybe he just plans
5745156 5747992 to phone this one in and go home early.<br />That wouldn't be a surprise.
5748076 5749577 Love you. Glad you could make it.
5749661 5752330 [Max]<br />One thing about Rocky we know for sure,
5752413 5755124 this guy's showing up in shape.
5755208 5756084 The old man's crazy.
5756167 5758836 -He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.<br />-Okay.
5758920 5761589 Take it easy. This is an exhibition.<br />All right? Do it to him.
5761673 5765009 You got three rounds to set a pace.<br />Every time you hit him, gotta make a dent.
5765093 5766302 Got it.
5766386 5768846 [Max]<br />The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight?
5768930 5770640 I can't believe it's here.
5771307 5772141 [bell rings]
5772225 5775019 [Max]<br />Round one begins. If old George Foreman
5775103 5779399 shocked the world with one punch,<br />why can't old Rocky Balboa?
5779482 5781943 [Jim] And as much excitement<br />as there is in the arena,
5782026 5784279 there's a sense of foreboding as well.
5788783 5792954 And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />goes to work with his jab as though
5793037 5796374 he's fighting against the number one<br />challenger in the heavyweight division.
5796457 5798835 [Max] This is to be expected early on.
5798918 5801087 You knew the champ<br />was going to control the distance
5801170 5803298 with his jab, his height, his range.
5805174 5809220 [Jim] Balboa, looking to gain a shot,<br />misses wildly.
5810888 5814017 [Larry] It looks like a speed bag<br />against a punching bag.
5814100 5815977 [Jim] Rocky is understandably frustrated,
5816060 5818146 but he came out of retirement<br />to get into a fight.
5818229 5821107 [Max] Guys named Rocky<br />don't like to be toyed with.
5821190 5823276 One punch could still turn it around.
5823359 5826029 [Larry] Apparently he forgot<br />his arthritis meds this morning.
5826112 5827822 [Jim] Rocky misses.
5827905 5831534 There's a meat-seeking missile<br />on the point of the chin by the champ.
5832243 5834037 More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.
5835079 5838374 And there's a hard right hand<br />and a left and a right by Balboa.
5838458 5841836 He drives Dixon into the ropes<br />with a series of shots.
5841919 5844756 -And the crowd goes berserk.<br />-[crowd cheering]
5848926 5853181 [Jim] Dixon punishing Balboa<br />for the temerity of landing those shots.
5853264 5855266 [crowd booing]
5856726 5860563 It's toe-to-toe in the corner.<br />Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
5860646 5862273 [crowd cheering]
5866319 5868029 [bell rings]
5868112 5871449 Balboa landing potent combinations<br />to the head of the champion.
5871532 5872992 A wake-up call for Dixon.
5873076 5874285 -[Duke] You all right?<br />-Yeah.
5874369 5876037 The man's got bricks in his gloves.
5876120 5878164 What happened to the angry stuff<br />in the basement?
5878247 5880083 -It's still there.<br />-He came to battle, okay?
5880166 5881626 -He tried to knock me out.<br />-Listen.
5881709 5884003 If there's any bone in your body<br />he can break, he will.
5884087 5885922 -His bones break too.<br />-Give the man respect.
5886005 5887256 What about my respect?
5887340 5889717 [Jim]<br />Compubox numbers tell the grisly story.
5889801 5893096 Balboa landed nine of 13 punches<br />in that round.
5893179 5898267 Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.
5898351 5899477 Listen to me this time.
5899560 5902105 [Max]<br />Rocky's been here a million times before.
5902188 5905525 Coming out to start another round after<br />he took a beating in the previous one.
5905608 5908611 -Remember what I said, okay?<br />- I warned him.
5909904 5914617 [Jim] He's tired. His legs are going fast,<br />or already gone.
5914700 5919539 [Max] And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it.
5919622 5924460 [Jim] The boxing commission,<br />which was criticized for licensing him,
5924544 5928256 would be massacred if<br />something happened to Rocky.
5929382 5930383 [grunts]
5932260 5935555 [Jim] And a monstrous straight left hand.<br />Down goes Rocky.
5935638 5937765 And that could conceivably<br />be the end of the fight.
5937849 5941686 That could be the exhibition right there.<br />But no. Balboa is up.
5941769 5945815 Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue, and Rocky says yes.
5945898 5949026 [Max] Even Rocky Balboa could be too brave<br />for his own good.
5949110 5952989 [Jim] Dixon comes right back to try<br />to finish it. Balboa almost went down.
5953072 5955074 [Larry] Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
5955158 5957493 [Jim] As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
5957577 5958870 Cover up. Cover up.
5958953 5961747 [Jim] Open shots at close range,<br />right and left hands,
5961831 5963332 and down goes Balboa.
5963416 5966461 Perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career.
5966544 5967920 [Larry] That should do it.
5968004 5971549 [Joe] Four. Five. Six.
5971632 5973342 Get up. Get up.
5973426 5975344 [Joe] Eight. Nine.
5975428 5976804 [crowd cheering]
5976888 5978222 How do you feel, Mac? You okay?
5978306 5980683 -[Jim] Now Rocky is furious with himself.<br />-Come on.
5980766 5983060 [Jim] He convinces Cortez<br />he wants to keep fighting.
5983144 5985229 Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,
5985313 5987023 Rocky waving his arms, saying he's fine.
5987106 5988733 -He wants to go on.<br />-Let it go.
5990067 5993362 [Jim] And Balboa comes back.<br />With a left and a right
5993446 5996949 and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row.
5997033 5998868 [crowd booing]
5998951 6001162 [Jim] Back comes Dixon<br />with brutal left-hand shots.
6001245 6003581 -[Jim] Dixon hurt his hand there.<br />-Go after him.
6003664 6005416 [Max]<br />This is Rocky's best chance right here.
6005500 6008002 The champ obviously<br />just hurt his hand on Rocky's hip.
6008085 6011839 [Jim] And Balboa immediately going to work<br />to the body. Huge right hook.
6011923 6014800 Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body.
6014884 6016219 These are big punches.
6016302 6019555 -[crowd chanting] Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...<br />-[dramatic music playing]
6019639 6022016 [crowd cheering]
6022099 6023351 [cheering]
6024560 6028940 [Jim] Rocky Balboa has knocked<br />the reigning heavyweight champion down.
6029023 6030358 You hurt him, Rocky.
6030441 6033444 [Jim] Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />has never taken this kind of punishment
6033528 6035530 in his entire professional career.
6035613 6037365 [Max] Maybe he's clearing his head, guys,
6037448 6039742 but the body shots<br />really caved in his ribs.
6039825 6043246 [Jim] Balboa is thinking knockout himself.
6043329 6046249 [Max] Another counterhook by Balboa,<br />followed by two more.
6046332 6049335 [Jim] Dixon fires back his own hooks.<br />Now Rocky's stunned.
6049418 6051629 It's an all-out war along the ropes
6051712 6056467 as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring.
6057468 6059136 [Max] Incredible.
6059220 6060221 All right.
6061305 6062932 Welcome to Rockyland.
6063015 6064934 [dramatic music playing]
6066936 6068521 -How's the hand?<br />- I think it's broken.
6071524 6073651 We lose, it's your ass. Your ass.
6073734 6076112 It will numb up on you<br />in a few rounds. All right?
6076195 6080032 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
6080116 6082618 Until then, here is Rocky's chance.
6082702 6083828 [Duke] No reverse.
6083911 6085329 [Martin] Take the pain, champ.
6085413 6088332 Stay on it. Everybody thought<br />this was a joke, including me.
6088416 6091127 Now nobody's laughing.<br />Stay on him. Go get him.
6091210 6092753 -[bell rings]<br />-Go out strong.
6092837 6095840 [dramatic music continues]
6105308 6106684 Keep him off you.
6110396 6111480 That's it.
6113357 6114775 [bell rings]
6115109 6115943 Yeah.
6119030 6120781 [dramatic music continues]
6125911 6127997 [Duke] You won that round. Break him down.
6128080 6129123 [rings]
6133544 6134754 Bomb him.
6141093 6142178 Yeah.
6146390 6148392 [Duke] Just keep throwing those bombs.
6149185 6151062 [dramatic music continues]
6160488 6161530 Come on.
6163157 6166160 [tense, unsettling music playing]
6169205 6170164 You can do this.
6172333 6174168 [distorts] Rocko, Rocko.
6181342 6182301 [Mason groans]
6183511 6184679 Get him. Go.
6184762 6188099 [dramatic music playing]
6194563 6197483 -[music intensifies]<br />-[crowd cheering]
6214458 6215501 [inaudible dialogue]
6218462 6219588 [grunts]
6230015 6233018 [tense, unsettling music playing]
6242778 6244864 Go through him. Run over him.
6246323 6249618 -[dramatic music playing]<br />-[crowd cheering]
6260254 6261589 Unload on him.
6263340 6264425 Get it done, Mason.
6273893 6274977 [bell rings]
6275311 6276270 [crowd cheering]
6276353 6278439 [Max] They are leaving nothing<br />on the table, guys.
6278522 6280316 [Larry] The fans are still standing.
6280399 6282943 They may not be able<br />to sit down for a week.
6283027 6283861 You're doing great.
6283944 6285905 I'm doing better than I thought.<br />I feel good.
6285988 6287490 [Martin] You sure he's okay?
6287573 6289867 -I've had worse.<br />-[Duke] He's been much worse.
6289950 6291869 [Jim] Toe-to-toe, one round to go.
6291952 6293788 Who would have believed this was possible?
6293871 6296332 -Can you see out of that eye?<br />-Let me talk.
6296415 6298876 Don't take any more chances out there<br />than you have to.
6298959 6301837 There's nothing more to prove, Pop.
6301921 6304173 I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
6304256 6305925 [Paulie] You can do it, Rocko.
6306008 6307301 One more round, we go home.
6307384 6308552 Okay, then do it.
6308636 6312097 [Larry] There's an old saying that<br />every great champion has one
6312181 6314308 great fight left in him,
6314391 6316644 and Rocky is proving it so far.
6316727 6319063 -[bell rings]<br />-[Joe] Come on, guys. Touch them up.
6319146 6321190 Rocko. The last round of your life.
6321273 6323776 -[Joe] Come on, guys.<br />-The last round.
6323859 6325361 [Joe] Touch them up.
6325945 6327238 You are one crazy old man.
6327321 6328906 You'll get there.
6328989 6330533 -[Joe] Let's go.<br />-[bell rings]
6330616 6334245 [Jim] Tenth round of a scheduled ten.<br />Who would ever have dreamed
6334328 6338541 that Rocky Balboa would still be in this,<br />quote, "exhibition"
6338624 6340584 against the heavyweight champion<br />of the world?
6340668 6341961 You can do it. Come on.
6342044 6345840 [Max] This fight is as though<br />Dixon got on-the-job training in courage.
6345923 6347424 [crowd cheering]
6347508 6348843 Cover up. Cover up.
6348926 6350928 [Max] They're both in a pain-free zone.
6351011 6353722 These guys are fighting<br />in another dimension right now.
6353806 6358185 [Jim] Beyond belief, Balboa just walking<br />straight into Dixon's punches.
6358269 6360145 Target practice for Dixon.
6364108 6366652 [Max] They're exchanging right hooks.<br />Balboa's drilled.
6366735 6370114 Here comes Dixon.<br />He's exhausted from punching the man.
6371532 6373284 Knock this bum out, Mace.
6375703 6376912 [exclaiming]
6377913 6380833 [tense, unsettling music playing]
6385880 6387715 [Rocky] What is it you said to the kid?
6387798 6390134 It ain't about how hard you hit.
6390217 6394179 It's about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep moving forward.
6394263 6398058 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
6399226 6401020 -Get up.<br />-Let's go. Get up.
6401103 6405149 -Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...<br />-Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...
6405232 6406191 [Rocky] Get up.
6406275 6408152 [dramatic music playing]
6410529 6413365 Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...
6417828 6420497 [crowd roaring]
6428005 6431884 [Jim] And another monster body shot.<br />Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.
6431967 6434178 Rocky. Start moving those hands.
6434261 6436263 [Jim] Less than two minutes to go.
6436347 6438891 The crowd is astonished<br />that Balboa got up.
6438974 6441268 -Come on.<br />-Turn it over. All the way through.
6441352 6444355 [Max] He begs for Dixon to punish him<br />some more. And retaliates with fury.
6446857 6448150 Chop him down.
6451737 6453530 Come on, Rocky.
6455866 6456951 Take him out now.
6458869 6460955 [Jim] They're trading shots again.
6461038 6463999 [Max] Balboa is trying to hit<br />anything and anywhere.
6466710 6468170 Win it. Win it.
6468253 6472049 [crowd chanting] Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...
6472132 6473467 [music intensifying]
6476637 6477554 -Yes.<br />-[bell rings]
6477888 6480099 -[bell ringing]<br />-[crowd roaring]
6480182 6482476 [triumphant music playing]
6487481 6490401 -You're a great champion. You got heart.<br />-Thanks.
6490484 6492945 Thanks for the opportunity. Good night.
6495447 6498492 That was unbelievable.<br />That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
6500536 6501370 You did it.
6501453 6503914 That's the kind of fighting<br />you're talking about.
6504832 6507084 -[Rocky] Hey, Paulie.<br />-[laughing]
6507167 6509920 That beast is gone now. The beast is out.
6510004 6513882 One of the most overused words<br />in sports, guys, is "incredible.”
6513966 6517386 I hate to say it. This is incredible.
6519805 6520764 Let's go.
6524184 6527938 [Michael] Ladies and gentlemen,<br />before we go to the scorecards,
6528022 6533318 a round of applause for<br />these two heavyweight warriors.
6533402 6535654 [crowd cheering]
6538657 6541702 We have a split decision.

6550502 6551670 Dixon.
6553380 6557885 Chuck Champer has it 95-94...
6557968 6558886 Balboa.
6558969 6560554 [crowd cheering]
6567144 6572232 And Bill Graham scores it 95-94
6572316 6577529 for the winner by split decision,<br />and still undefeated,
6577613 6580449 the heavyweight champion of the world,
6580532 6586121 Mason "The Line" Dixon.
