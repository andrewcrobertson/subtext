103000 106320 <i>Yet another quick knockout for<br />Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>
106480 108440 <i>The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.</i>
108600 111480 <i>Hide the women and children.<br />This could get ugly.</i>
111640 115600 <i>This crowd does nothing to hide<br />its anger over this latest debacle.</i>
116000 118720 <i>The fans are mad as hell.<br />They don't want to take it anymore.</i>
118920 121680 <i>They seem to be blaming Dixon,<br />a good fighter, for the decline...</i>
121840 125960 <i>... not only of the heavyweight-division<br />guys, but of the entire sport.</i>
126120 127480 <i>They're actually pelting...</i>
127640 131080 <i>... the undefeated heavyweight<br />champion of the world with ice.</i>
131240 134760 <i>Maybe this angry, visceral reaction<br />will pressure Dixon to fight someone...</i>
134960 137760 <i>... who can fight back for a change.<br />If there's somebody out there.</i>
137920 142920 <i>All of boxing is hoping for a warrior<br />who thrills us with his passion.</i>
284960 286960 Time goes by too fast.
287120 290280 Yeah? Not fast enough.
290440 292560 - Your kid should've been here.<br />- That's all right.
292720 296000 - No, it ain't all right.<br />- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
296200 297800 He don't get that busy.
298080 302040 Let's not talk about it here, okay?<br />You're coming tonight, right?
302240 305800 I'm working. I took the tour<br />the last three years.
305960 307960 I know, but it's the anniversary.
308120 309680 Fine. You got my word.
309840 314120 I appreciate it, thank you.<br />I owe you, Paulie.
344400 347440 Yo, Robert. What's going on?<br />Where have you been? You're late.
349200 351720 No. I don't wanna hear this.<br />Look, your job performance...
351920 354760 ...is nowhere near good enough<br />to be pulling this.
354920 357800 I don't give a damn who your father is.<br />You understand me?
357960 360120 - All right. Now get out of here.<br />- Okay.
360280 361960 Thank you, sir.
364240 366440 Yo, Robert. Yo.
366600 368280 - Hey, Rocky.<br />- Hey.
368600 369760 - Hey, how you doing?<br />- Hey.
369920 371360 What's up, champ?
371520 373160 - You caught me off guard.<br />- I know.
373320 375160 I wanted to catch you<br />before you got busy.
375320 376920 Yeah, it gets busy up there.
377080 379560 - So how you doing? Yeah?<br />- Real good. Yeah.
379960 382840 - Yo, Rock!<br />- Yeah, how you doing?
383000 384560 Yeah, real good.
384720 387240 Listen, you wanna go out<br />and get some coffee?
387400 389000 I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?
389520 392440 Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to<br />come by the restaurant tonight.
392600 394960 I can have something<br />made special for you.
395120 398840 Tonight I can't. I got plans.<br />A few of the guys get together.
399400 401960 - Did I do something wrong?<br />- What do you mean?
402120 404680 Well, I don't know exactly<br />what I mean...
404880 408640 ...but I just think, like, when I come<br />here, you don't feel so comfortable.
408840 411000 And I certainly don't wanna do that.
412320 415240 - Well, you throw a big shadow.<br />- A big shadow?
415400 417920 You're not gonna get anything done<br />down here, Robert.
418080 421320 Well, if you're not gonna introduce me,<br />I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.
421480 423560 - How you doing?<br />- Your son works for me.
424080 425720 - It's a good job.<br />- Yeah.
425880 428600 I've told Robert about 20 times<br />that I wanted to meet you.
428760 430840 You're pretty busy,<br />which isn't a bad thing.
431040 433320 - I get a little tied up.<br />- Grab a shot, will you?
433880 437000 I may not get this chance again.<br />Old warhorses have to stick together.
437160 439400 - The old horses, yeah.<br />- I'll tell you.
440240 443160 - Good thing it's not your left.<br />- This makes you popular with people.
443560 446360 - One, two, three.<br />- Finally, we get to meet.
446520 449160 I gotta get going. It was nice<br />to meet you face to face.
449320 452560 You take care of yourself.<br />Robert, I'll see you later.
454840 458280 I gotta get going.<br />I'll change my plans for tonight.
458440 460200 That'd be great.<br />I'm looking forward to it.
460400 461760 - How you doing?<br />- Okay.
461920 463640 - Okay.<br />- All right.
463800 467080 And do not let those numbers<br />drive you crazy.
467240 471120 - Too late.<br />- Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.
473160 474320 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Hey, guys.
474680 476680 - Hey, Rock.<br />- Hey, how you doing?
491480 492440 There you go.
497880 501200 It'll be about 10 tenths.<br />You guys take care, okay? You got it.
504400 506320 I'll try a few of these later on.
507120 509560 - It's good for baking.<br />- How much...?
509720 511600 - Yo, Paul, what's the cost?<br />- 58.40, sir.
511760 514080 All right, take it out of that.<br />I trust you.
516280 517920 - How you doing?<br />- You're too generous.
518080 519720 Not a problem.
535200 537520 How you guys doing?
543600 545640 How we doing, Isabel?
545800 548080 Okay, except for the freebie<br />reading the Bible.
548240 550600 - He's okay.<br />- Just because you fought him...
550760 553520 ...don't mean you gotta feed him.<br />He doesn't look like a fighter.
553680 555280 Spider Rico could hit.
555440 557920 - Listen, how's your stomach?<br />- It's okay.
558120 560320 If you keep rubbing olive oil<br />on your stomach...
560480 562400 ...your kid's gonna be<br />born very strong.
562560 565320 - Okay, Rocky. Whatever you say.<br />- No, really.
568080 570560 - Yo, how you doing, Spider?<br />- God bless you, Rocky.
570760 571920 Thanks.
577040 578920 How you guys doing?
580720 584360 Jose, can you make something special<br />for my kid who's coming tonight?
584560 585800 No problemo.
585960 588920 Good. I appreciate it.
590600 593400 <i>Back and forth, back and forth,<br />give and take.</i>
593560 596680 And then I went in there like an animal<br />and threw him into the corner...
596880 600400 ...and I unloaded everything I had.<br />Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
600560 603080 But Creed, he kept<br />busting me back pretty good...
603280 605120 ...and the agony began to pile up.
605280 608440 Then I heard the best sound<br />that I ever heard in my life...
608600 610160 - The bell.<br />- That's right, the bell.
610320 613360 I ain't never been so tired,<br />and I'm sitting in my corner.
613520 616040 I'm trying to figure out<br />how to survive the last round...
616240 617960 ...when Mickey leans<br />into my ear and says:
618160 621120 "Come on, get out there<br />and fight this guy hard, you bum.
621280 625920 You gotta be first. You gotta be first."<br />I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could...
626080 628720 - "I would."<br />...I would."
628880 630120 The end.
655760 658840 <i>Yet another quick knockout for<br />Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>
659000 661560 <i>The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.</i>
661720 663240 <i>They're actually pelting...</i>
663440 667840 <i>... the undefeated heavyweight<br />champion of the world with ice.</i>
672680 675840 Hello, Adrian's. Yeah?
676360 680520 Tell him you can't make it?<br />Yeah, I'll give him the message.
681840 685800 I just kept hearing Mickey's voice<br />in my head over and over again.
686000 687840 I just dug down,<br />and before you know it...
688000 691080 ...it was toe to toe and it was...<br />Excuse me.
691240 695280 Your son said he can't make it.<br />He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?
708160 709320 <i>Look at these birds.</i>
709480 712160 <i>Don't these birds look like candy?<br />Flying candy?</i>
712320 714160 <i>Hey, birdie,<br />you wanna fly me home?</i>
714320 716720 You need somebody<br />to walk you home?
717640 718560 <i>No?</i>
718760 723440 It's a cold night. We need a few laughs<br />in our life. What do you think? Maybe?
724080 726000 <i>Maybe? Maybe?</i>
726160 728560 <i>Okay. Let's get out of here, okay?</i>
742960 745280 That place ain't changed much<br />from last year.
745440 747120 Are we done?
747440 749520 Hey, how you doing, Mick?
752280 754160 That sign is falling apart, Paulie.
754320 757520 The whole world is falling apart.<br />Look at us.
757680 759960 Don't talk crazy, Paulie.
760200 765240 You know, I think if you live someplace<br />long enough, you are that place.
765840 768280 I ain't no talking building.
768440 770600 Come on, it's getting late, Rocko.
770920 773520 I get a headache from this train.
792640 795400 I remember when<br />she was standing there...
795560 799080 ...all nervous and shy,<br />with this little smile.
799720 802760 And all I wanted her to do<br />was trust me.
806000 807880 She did.
808880 811240 - She did.<br />- You done?
826160 828840 - How long are we staying here?<br />- Not long.
829000 831240 Well, I'm glad they tore<br />this ice rink down.
831440 832600 Come on.
832760 836400 You heard me.<br />I'm happy they tore it apart.
839920 844160 First time I walked your sister<br />across this ice, we was over there.
844360 847680 She was nervous, but I wasn't so great<br />on the blades either.
847880 851720 Ice is stupid. People standing on ice<br />are more stupid.
852920 856720 And over there,<br />when she was falling...
857040 858480 ...and my hand grabbed her...
859560 863280 ...and I got her arm through that coat,<br />I could feel it.
864040 865720 Electric.
866200 868560 You said the same thing<br />last year, Rock.
869800 871000 Did I?
871160 873280 - so you better develop your brain.
873440 875240 - You're left-handed.<br />- Absolutely.
875400 877600 Come on, Rock. Let's go.
879920 883560 We're done. There's no place<br />to sit down around here.
883760 885000 It's all right.
885160 889320 It ain't all right! It's depressing<br />and freaking cold!
890000 891560 What's the matter with you, Paulie?
891920 893960 You're living backwards, Rocko!
894120 897480 Change the channel from yesterday!<br />Yesterday wasn't so great!
897640 899920 - It was to me.<br />- Not to me!
901720 904760 You treated her good.<br />You had the good times.
905640 909000 I treated her bad.<br />I don't have to think about this.
910360 912440 She always loved you, Paulie.
916560 919720 Sorry, Rocko,<br />I can't do this no more.
989560 990680 Can I help you?
991080 993640 No, no, I used to come down<br />to this place a long time ago.
993800 996320 I was just looking around.<br />No big deal.
997160 998320 Can I get you a drink?
1000200 1003400 - All right. Maybe just a short beer.<br />- Okay.
1011920 1013640 Go. Go on.
1014600 1016360 Yeah, go on.<br />Get him to buy a round.
1016520 1018320 Get him to buy a round. Go.
1018680 1021440 Get him to... He's got it.<br />He's spending money.
1021600 1026600 Listen, I don't mean to cross the line<br />or anything...
1026760 1029600 ...but I read about your wife's passing<br />a few years back.
1029800 1031280 Yeah, it was woman cancer.
1031440 1034320 Yeah. I always heard<br />she was a nice person.
1034480 1036800 Yeah, the best.
1037800 1040040 - Do I know you?<br />- We met a long time ago.
1040560 1041560 We did?
1041760 1044160 When I was a kid,<br />you walked me home.
1044320 1047440 - I did?<br />- Told me to stop smoking and things.
1048920 1051040 Stop smoking...
1051680 1055080 Are you Little Marie that used to<br />hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
1055240 1057000 Yeah, that's right.
1057600 1059880 Yeah, now I remember.<br />I walked you home.
1060040 1063760 When you got there, you turned<br />around and said, "Screw you, creepo."
1063920 1066120 - I didn't say that.<br />- Yeah, you did.
1066320 1069600 - You sure?<br />- Great insults last a long time.
1069760 1073000 Yo! Yo, is that you?<br />Is that really you?
1073520 1075720 - How you doing?<br />- I think he wants to drink alone.
1075960 1078800 Well, then give him his drink, then.<br />I ain't stopping you.
1079000 1082320 What's that, your man or something?<br />No, I don't think so.
1085040 1088200 Anyway, me and my friends,<br />we're right down there.
1088400 1091560 Think you could buy us a round?<br />You got the money. Just one round.
1091720 1094480 Hey. Thank you.
1094640 1097640 What are you doing<br />pushing my hand away like that?
1097800 1100080 - What's your name?<br />- Angie. What do you wanna know for?
1100240 1103120 - Don't be playing a fool for that guy.<br />- A fool?
1103280 1104400 - Yeah.<br />- A fool?
1104560 1107440 I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!
1107600 1110480 You got it twisted. You're the fool.<br />I'm a person, just like you.
1110680 1114120 You ain't no better than me. You think<br />you're a big shot now? You're nothing.
1114280 1117960 You ain't no better than me.<br />No better!
1119520 1120760 Glad you dropped in?
1120920 1123480 I think the neighborhood<br />is changing a little.
1124320 1126920 - What was that all about?<br />- I don't know. Forget about it.
1127120 1130200 I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna<br />take off, I'll tally everything up.
1130360 1131920 - Yeah, thanks.<br />- How you doing, Rock?
1132080 1133640 I'm good, thanks.
1136080 1138760 - You live around here?<br />- About eight blocks from here.
1139920 1141640 Eight blocks.
1142800 1144480 You need a lift?
1144920 1146880 All right.
1147040 1148760 Did you ever get married?
1148920 1150640 - Yeah, sort of.<br />- Sort of?
1150800 1153200 - Yeah, well, he took off.<br />- Poof, just like that?
1153360 1155400 Yeah, just like that.
1155840 1158600 - You sort of have any kids?<br />- Yeah, I got one kid.
1158800 1162280 Yeah? Me too. Me too.<br />Wonderful boy.
1162440 1165960 Hey, tough guy! What's the matter,<br />you can't buy a round?
1166120 1168560 The girl was being nice<br />to your dumb ass.
1168720 1171280 - What you doing with that pig?<br />- Think you can disrespect us?
1171440 1174240 - She ain't nothing but a jealous bitch!<br />- Come on back!
1174600 1176280 Hey, don't listen to them.
1176440 1179360 Both of youse,<br />you ain't no better than me.
1179520 1182640 Come over here, you'll get<br />your head kicked in around here.
1182800 1186720 - You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.<br />- You ain't no big shot, look at you.
1186880 1190640 You ain't even got a car<br />to take that pig home.
1193240 1194480 You all right?
1195960 1196920 Yeah.
1199440 1202120 What are you doing?<br />Don't get out. It's all right.
1204840 1207880 No, Little Marie. It ain't all right.
1212480 1214160 - Yo.<br />- What?
1214360 1216240 I'll tell you what. Get inside.
1216400 1219320 - You get inside. Yeah, you.<br />- Hey, leave him alone!
1219480 1220680 - Yo, man!<br />- See it?
1220840 1222920 - You see that? You see that?<br />- Yeah. All right.
1223120 1225320 - What do you say?<br />- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
1225520 1227080 Get a job!
1242480 1244400 That guy sends his apologies.
1245200 1246640 Okay.
1262760 1266960 Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!
1271600 1273400 I see you still got your key.
1273560 1275400 Yeah, I got a key.<br />You got time to talk?
1276080 1278640 I got a lot of time<br />since your people let me go.
1278800 1281000 You know I had<br />nothing to do with that.
1281200 1282640 Yeah.
1284240 1286200 Yeah, we moved in<br />about a year ago.
1286360 1288600 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.
1288760 1291560 - Yeah, I could see that.<br />- I'm gonna look for an apartment.
1291720 1293240 Apartments are nice.
1293400 1295080 Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
1295240 1297040 Yeah, it is what it is.
1297200 1300280 This place used to be pretty nice.<br />There's a lot of history around here.
1300440 1301920 - Yeah.<br />- Like down the street...
1302080 1303600 ...is the Cambria Fight Club.
1303760 1305560 They used to call it<br />the Bucket of Blood.
1305720 1308840 I took some massive beatings there.<br />But it was nice. Good memories.
1309040 1313880 And I heard these buildings are like,<br />I don't know, 100, 150 years old.
1314040 1318920 If I was 150 years old, I'd be falling<br />apart too. So it's okay, building.
1319080 1320240 Does that light work?
1320400 1322640 - No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.<br />- Yeah?
1325160 1329360 Listen, thanks for the ride,<br />and I'm sorry about those guys.
1329520 1332960 Some of those guys just got their<br />brains on backwards and stuff.
1333120 1335880 - What's he doing out so late?<br />- Is that your kid?
1336040 1338080 Yeah. Wish he wouldn't<br />stay out so late.
1338360 1341040 - Amazing.<br />- Yeah, what's that?
1341640 1343880 Last time I seen you,<br />you was a kid...
1344040 1346120 ...and now you officially<br />got one of your own.
1346280 1347320 It's amazing.
1347480 1351400 You know, he sort of resembles you.<br />He's got that big Irish hair.
1352240 1353480 Yeah, it's the other one.
1356800 1359080 - Yeah?<br />- His father was from Jamaica.
1359280 1360520 Jamaica? European.
1363440 1365760 Was you on a cruise ship<br />or something?
1365920 1367760 - No, not really.<br />- What's his name?
1367920 1372360 - Steps. Short for Stevenson.<br />- Makes sense.
1375760 1378760 Does he look mad at me, or is it<br />maybe the angle I'm standing at?
1378960 1381480 No. He's a good kid.
1381640 1383960 - You wanna meet him?<br />- It's getting kind of late.
1384120 1387560 - I got so many things to do.<br />- Yeah, yeah, I understand.
1388400 1392200 Thanks again for the ride<br />and everything else.
1394160 1395640 I'll see you.
1396720 1398120 You too.
1398280 1402040 Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go.<br />Say good night to your friend.
1402280 1404600 What are you doing out<br />in the cold with no hat on?
1404760 1407040 - Did you get something to eat?<br />- Yeah, I already ate.
1407200 1408720 All right.
1408880 1411120 - You're late, you know.<br />- I can take care of myself.
1411920 1413800 Yo, Little Marie!
1414920 1416800 Ain't you gonna<br />introduce me to your kid?
1416960 1419080 - How you doing, Steps?<br />- What's up?
1419280 1424240 Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,<br />nice little eatery not too far from here.
1424400 1426320 What's all this junk? Got a tissue.
1426480 1429960 Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo,<br />all the stuff in my pocket, you know.
1430160 1432200 Here you go.<br />I got a card, there it is.
1432360 1434320 And if you ever get a chance,<br />it'd be great...
1434480 1437200 ...if both of youse<br />come down there and eat.
1437360 1442960 It'd be great, free. You know.<br />Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.
1444120 1447520 I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.
1450920 1452600 See you later.
1454560 1456360 Come on, let's go.
1458800 1461000 <i>You've known what's best for you<br />since you were 10.</i>
1461160 1463080 Since you walked in here alone.
1464040 1466400 Got everything money can buy...
1466560 1468520 ...except what it can't.
1469320 1473120 It's pride. Pride is what got<br />your ass out of here.
1474600 1476360 Losing is what brung you back.
1477880 1482440 But people like you, they need<br />to be tested. Need a challenge.
1482640 1484760 That ain't gonna happen.<br />Ain't nothing out there.
1485080 1488360 There's always somebody<br />out there. Always.
1488800 1490960 When that time comes<br />and you find something...
1491120 1493520 ...standing in front of you<br />that ain't running...
1493680 1498800 ...that ain't backing up, hitting on you,<br />and you're too damn tired to breathe...
1499160 1502000 You find that situation on you,<br />that's good.
1502160 1504600 Because that's baptism under fire.
1506600 1509160 You get through that,<br />you find the only kind of respect...
1509360 1510920 ...that matters in this damn world:
1511120 1513160 Self-respect.
1515600 1518360 Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.
1518520 1520200 Now, what can the champ<br />do for you?
1521520 1524040 You can give me<br />some of that money you got.
1525240 1527720 - You know, I like you, Martin.<br />- But not that much.
1528760 1530680 Exactly.
1534320 1536440 How about a picture with the kid?<br />All right?
1536600 1537960 Sure.
1539800 1542480 Here, son, hold up your fist.<br />Makes you look more hazardous.
1545040 1546280 - There you go.<br />- Thanks, Rock.
1546440 1548200 Enjoy your meal.
1549040 1550560 - He's a nice guy, isn't he?<br />- Rocky?
1550720 1552760 - Yeah.<br />- Spider just went downstairs.
1552920 1555280 - I don't know if that's all right.<br />- What's he doing?
1555440 1557640 I don't know. That's your friend.
1563480 1564840 Yo, Spider!
1565040 1568440 - Let me do some dishes. I feel better.<br />- Come on. You're my guest.
1568600 1571000 - Let me do something.<br />- Keep eating. Guests do that.
1571160 1573480 Don't make me fight you again.<br />Last time you got lucky.
1573920 1575880 Lucky? Okay.
1576080 1577640 Jesus wants me to work.
1578320 1580680 - Yo, Rocky.<br />- Yeah?
1580840 1581880 You've got guests.
1584400 1586080 Don't get too wet, okay?
1587440 1589160 Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
1595280 1596880 You kept the card.
1597040 1598800 Yeah, I kept the card.
1598960 1601200 - Why don't you sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
1610400 1614760 Because, you know what, I walk in<br />there, I say good morning, I do this:
1615360 1616560 <i>Tonight, boxing once again.</i>
1616720 1619400 <i>Two contrasting styles<br />in almost every way.</i>
1619560 1622760 Hey, can you turn this up?<br />Turn this up, please.
1622920 1626120 <i>Who was the best of all time?<br />If two athletes from different eras...</i>
1626320 1629360 <i>... could compete against one another,<br />who would come out on top?</i>
1629520 1633160 <i>Given the same rules, using the same<br />equipment, who was the greatest?</i>
1633360 1635080 <i>We feed our facts<br />into the computer.</i>
1635280 1637560 <i>They weigh in on who they<br />think will reign supreme...</i>
1637720 1640720 <i>... while fielding the comments of our<br />illustrious panel of sportswriters.</i>
1646280 1647840 Champ!
1649360 1650760 - Yo, champ!<br />- Yeah?
1650920 1653720 Come check out this trash<br />they're talking about you, man!
1653880 1656720 - What you talking about?<br />- Come check this out. Hurry up.
1657000 1659240 <i>Tonight, the former two-time<br />heavyweight champion...</i>
1659440 1661360 <i>... from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.</i>
1661520 1663440 <i>All right, Chuck Johnson,<br />USA Today?</i>
1663600 1666240 <i>There's no question that<br />Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights...</i>
1666400 1667880 <i>... during a tougher era in boxing.</i>
1668080 1669800 <i>You look at Mason Dixon<br />in his career...</i>
1670000 1672200 <i>... he's basically been<br />spoon-fed his opponents.</i>
1672360 1674440 <i>No question in my mind.<br />Not only does Rocky win...</i>
1674640 1675880 <i>... but he wins knockout.</i>
1677880 1679440 Rocky!
1680760 1681720 Offspring.
1682960 1683960 <i>Bernard Fernandez?</i>
1684120 1685800 <i>Dixon is a victim<br />of his own dominance.</i>
1686000 1688920 <i>He's never been in<br />real knockdown-dragout brawls.</i>
1689080 1690760 <i>He never had to dig down<br />to rally back.</i>
1691240 1693040 <i>If he tries to dig down<br />against Balboa...</i>
1693200 1695560 <i>... he'll find he doesn't have<br />a big enough shovel.</i>
1695720 1698440 <i>I clearly give it to Balboa.</i>
1698640 1701720 What happened to you?<br />What happened to you?
1701880 1704200 <i>Boxing historian<br />Burt Randolph Sugar.</i>
1704360 1707400 <i>Dixon has fought cream puffs.<br />We don't know what he's made of.</i>
1707600 1709640 <i>But both in their primes,<br />you gotta factor in...</i>
1709800 1711600 <i>... Dixon's unbelievable speed...</i>
1711760 1714280 <i>... his slashing offense.<br />He cuts Balboa to bits.</i>
1714480 1717160 <i>No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.</i>
1718440 1722680 <i>Here's where our subjectivity ends.<br />Let's see what the computer says.</i>
1722840 1727400 <i>Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has<br />no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.</i>
1728400 1730120 - What time is it?<br />- Mason time.
1730320 1732840 - What time is it?<br />- Mason time.
1733000 1735080 - What time is it?<br />- Mason time.
1743120 1747360 <i>Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.<br />He is almost out on his feet!</i>
1747560 1749960 <i>Balboa turning up the heat.<br />Pounds him across the ring.</i>
1750160 1753720 <i>Boy, he's bit off more than he<br />can chew this time. Believe it.</i>
1753880 1757080 <i>Oh, a murderous right hook!<br />And Dixon is out on his feet.</i>
1757480 1760520 <i>He is out cold as he<br />crumbles to the canvas.</i>
1760680 1764720 <i>And it is Balboa who has won...</i>
1765800 1768480 Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky.<br />Baby Rocky.
1774720 1778960 I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat<br />that up, it's pretty good in the morning.
1780200 1781600 Yeah, thanks, man.
1782120 1785640 Nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving<br />you a headache. I like this old stuff.
1785840 1787880 No, I like it. It's nice.
1788320 1790280 Well, good. Good.
1799280 1803360 Yo, you think Steps wants a job?<br />Make a few bucks on the weekend?
1803520 1807000 It's good making your own G's. My kid<br />stashed a few bucks doing that.
1807560 1809200 Why are you being so nice?
1810400 1812520 I don't want you to think<br />nothing's off, you know.
1812680 1815720 My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.<br />You know what I mean?
1815880 1817880 Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking that.<br />Believe me.
1818040 1820560 - No? Then what was you thinking?<br />- No.
1820720 1823080 That you don't owe us nothing.<br />What are you doing?
1823240 1824880 Be patient.
1825040 1826480 Now...
1827000 1830800 ...I don't owe you nothing,<br />but why do you gotta...
1830960 1834440 ...owe something to get...?
1835360 1836520 Bingo.
1841640 1845800 Why do you gotta owe something<br />to get something, you know? Really.
1848560 1852120 I think hanging out with your kid<br />would be nice. What do you think?
1852280 1854400 I think that'd be nice.
1855440 1858720 Good. That's very nice.
1858880 1861000 I'm glad you come by.
1861440 1864600 It was nice watching you eat.
1866440 1868160 Good company.
1871080 1873520 Yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!
1884120 1886080 - You like dogs?<br />- Dogs?
1886280 1890760 Dogs. This is like a dog pound.<br />It's where they keep...
1891200 1895720 ...a large variety of dogs. I used to<br />come here all the time for sightseeing.
1895880 1899160 But, you know,<br />you learn a lot talking to dogs.
1899320 1902640 - Really, you do.<br />- Yeah, man. So...
1902800 1905200 Hey, man, how about this one?
1906800 1908440 He don't look too friendly, my friend.
1908600 1911200 Man, this is the one.<br />Hey, boy, how you doing?
1911360 1914480 Hey, what about this one here?<br />Come here, boy.
1914640 1916080 - Who, him?<br />- Yeah, why not?
1916240 1918320 Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
1918480 1922640 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.<br />If you look at it closely, the color...
1922800 1926480 ...it looks like old furniture, like some<br />kind of pirate-chest thing going on.
1926640 1929000 Yeah, sure, man.<br />Hey, so how about a young one?
1929160 1932480 Steps, forget him. Come over here.<br />I want you to see something.
1932680 1936840 Now, you notice what this animal<br />is doing here? Lying in that position?
1937040 1938200 He ain't doing nothing.
1938360 1941000 No, he's doing a lot.<br />He ain't wasting no energy.
1941160 1942280 Because he's dead.
1948280 1951080 He ain't dead. There's a lot of<br />good mileage left on that animal.
1951240 1955120 Good food, the addition of a couple<br />of new friends, bingo, he's back.
1955280 1958600 - What do you think is a good name?<br />- It's your dog. You name him.
1958760 1961240 No. It's, like,<br />a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
1961400 1963760 Look, I don't know much<br />about no dogs.
1963920 1965480 Well, it ain't that complicated.
1965680 1969120 You pet him, you feed him,<br />and nature takes its course.
1969320 1972040 You know, so...<br />Don't you wanna name an animal?
1972200 1976040 Every guy should at one time<br />try to name an animal something.
1976560 1977920 I don't know. Fleabag?
1978680 1982600 It's catchy. It ain't original,<br />but it's pretty good.
1982760 1985040 I think you could come up with,<br />in your young brain...
1985200 1988080 ...something better to throw out<br />than Fleabag.
1988880 1990640 Punchy. How's that?
1992080 1994400 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah, Punchy.
1998000 1999960 - I like it, you know.<br />- For real?
2000120 2005160 Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to<br />remember, it's not that hard to spell.
2005320 2008560 And once it's in your brain, you never<br />forget it. Punchy. Very good.
2008720 2011280 - All right, man.<br />- Good call.
2011440 2014480 All right, Punchy. You ready<br />to get bailed out, my friend?
2014760 2016520 Okay.
2017600 2019400 Hey, you know<br />it was a joke, don't you?
2019560 2022200 Yeah, I know.<br />You're a very funny guy.
2055600 2057160 Rocky?
2058080 2060120 <i>The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.</i>
2060280 2062440 - Excuse me.<br />- Sure.
2064000 2066280 <i>This could get ugly.</i>
2067000 2068440 - Rock.<br />- Yo, Paulie.
2068600 2071400 They're gonna be talking about<br />that fake Looney Tune fight.
2072080 2074720 Hey, come on. We're about<br />to serve today's special.
2074880 2078200 Italian food cooked up by a bunch<br />of Mexicans ain't so special.
2078360 2080240 Hey, yo.
2081520 2083040 Hey, I skipped work for this.
2086800 2089280 What an ugly dog.
2090480 2091760 It's a cute dog.
2093960 2095120 - Hey, Rock.<br />- Yeah?
2095280 2098080 I'm gonna take off.<br />That stuff back there is pretty cool.
2098280 2099560 - Oh, you like that?<br />- Yeah, man.
2100080 2102240 - Thanks, I appreciate it.<br />- I'll catch you later.
2102400 2104120 All right.
2108560 2110640 - Who's the criminal?<br />- He's a nice kid.
2110800 2112400 He dresses like a bum.
2112840 2115280 Coming from a human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.
2116720 2118120 Hide the silverware.
2118320 2119800 That's nice.
2121680 2122760 Hey, Spider.
2127360 2129520 Didn't you knock out<br />that bum once?
2129680 2131600 Will you give it a rest?
2141560 2144720 I'm gonna be late for work for this.<br />Give me a break, huh?
2144960 2147600 All right. Just for a few seconds.
2147760 2150840 <i>In the late '60s, a simulated fight<br />took place between two legends...</i>
2151040 2153320 <i>... Muhammad Ali<br />and Rocky Marciano.</i>
2153520 2157120 <i>Marciano long retired,<br />and Ali unable to fight legitimately...</i>
2157280 2160520 <i>... for three years for having refused<br />induction into the armed forces...</i>
2160680 2163360 <i>... was in need of money,<br />and agreed to the dream match...</i>
2163520 2165960 <i>... whose outcome would be<br />decided by a computer.</i>
2166160 2168280 <i>It's almost 35 years<br />since Rocky Marciano...</i>
2168440 2170720 <i>... won the much-disputed<br />computer decision...</i>
2170880 2173480 <i>... and guess what?<br />Not much has changed.</i>
2173640 2175720 <i>Last week, Rocky Balboa<br />won a decisive fight...</i>
2175920 2178800 See? That's the cartoon fight<br />I'm telling you about.
2178960 2180400 Yeah.
2180560 2181960 <i>A stunning knockout.</i>
2182120 2184640 <i>Keep in mind, this is taking<br />the human factor out of it.</i>
2184840 2186560 <i>- The computer says Balboa...<br />- Beautiful.</i>
2186720 2191320 <i>... would be triumphant, KO 13.<br />And here's some of the fallout:</i>
2191480 2193600 <i>What started as a simple<br />form of entertainment...</i>
2193760 2195960 <i>... has become a rallying cry<br />for people who think...</i>
2196120 2198760 <i>... an old-school athlete like Balboa<br />could actually be better.</i>
2198960 2202520 <i>Computer technology has to create<br />what isn't. That's just not responsible.</i>
2202680 2204560 Get therapy, will you?
2204720 2207160 <i>How do you think Balboa<br />would have done against Dixon?</i>
2207320 2210360 <i>Badly. Personally, I think Balboa<br />was completely overrated.</i>
2210520 2212280 <i>He owns a restaurant<br />in South Philly.</i>
2212440 2214320 <i>What's the specialty,<br />pounded chicken?</i>
2214480 2217800 <i>Anyway, I would have paid to see<br />the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...</i>
2218000 2219800 <i>... and the controversy<br />that won't go away.</i>
2219960 2222280 <i>Let's go back to Sunday's race...</i>
2222440 2224040 Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.
2224200 2227560 It's free advertisement.<br />Come on. Meat house calls.
2237200 2238920 Yo, Robert.
2241360 2242880 What are you doing out so late?
2243040 2245480 I tried calling,<br />but nothing was picking up.
2245680 2247800 - Is something wrong?<br />- I just wanted to come by...
2247960 2249880 ...and see you in person.<br />- Wanna come inside?
2250040 2252720 No. I just wanna get<br />your opinion on something.
2253360 2254760 Sure. Opinion on what?
2254920 2257160 You know, they say you only<br />go around once, right?
2257360 2259480 - Yeah, I've heard that.<br />- Well...
2259640 2262040 ...I think I wanna, like,<br />do something.
2262200 2265000 - Like what?<br />- Fight.
2265760 2269200 You know, nothing big.<br />Small stuff, like locally. You know.
2271040 2273760 Don't you think you're too,<br />you know, old?
2274280 2276120 You think you ought to<br />stop trying things...
2276280 2278640 ...because you had a few<br />too many birthdays? I do not.
2278800 2280200 People will think you're crazy.
2280360 2284080 What's crazy about standing<br />toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?
2284360 2285800 That's just ego talking.
2287280 2289840 What are you trying to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
2290800 2293200 Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...
2293360 2295400 ...the way other people think<br />a long time ago.
2295560 2297160 You gotta think like you think.
2298960 2302520 - I do.<br />- Do you? Good.
2302680 2307040 You gotta face reality, okay?<br />It's a different world now.
2307920 2310160 Only the clothes is different.
2312080 2314960 I really don't know<br />what you want from me.
2315320 2320080 I just wanted us to get involved.<br />You know, like, home team.
2322040 2327280 Look, whatever it is, whatever<br />you're going through, it'll pass.
2327480 2329400 Yeah, you're probably right.
2329560 2332000 Time is gonna catch up to all of us.
2332240 2335400 - Especially if you're standing still.<br />- Hey, come on.
2338160 2340360 Look, I'm gonna call you<br />in the morning.
2343160 2345520 <i>- Did you tell this to your kid?<br />- Yeah, I did.</i>
2345680 2347760 <i>- What'd he think, you're nuts, right?<br />- Yeah.</i>
2347920 2353440 Oh, well, he don't believe in you?<br />Welcome to my world, buddy.
2353600 2356680 Rocko, nobody's giving you<br />no title shot.
2356880 2359160 I know that. I don't want one.
2359320 2361640 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
2362760 2364040 No.
2364240 2367120 You're mad because<br />they took down your statue?
2367720 2369480 No.
2370280 2371760 Not really, no.
2371960 2376840 If it's about money, just hang a sign<br />around your neck saying, "Punch me."
2377040 2379880 Five dollars, you'll make big money.
2381520 2383840 What? You haven't peaked yet?
2384720 2387000 - Peaked?<br />- Yeah, peaked.
2387440 2389800 I don't know. There's still<br />some stuff in the basement.
2390840 2393480 - What basement?<br />- In here.
2394280 2395880 Tell me about the stuff.
2397120 2400400 - What about it?<br />- Tell me about the stuff inside.
2400560 2402920 - Is it angry?<br />- Angry?
2403080 2405080 Are you mad because<br />Adrian left you?
2405240 2407720 She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
2407920 2409640 Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
2413960 2417520 You know, sometimes<br />it's hard to breathe.
2417680 2421280 You know, I feel, like,<br />this beast inside me.
2421560 2424120 It's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.
2424280 2427560 Is it okay?
2432680 2436120 I just never knew it was<br />supposed to be this hard.
2436280 2439120 It wasn't supposed to be like this,<br />Paulie. You know, it...
2448720 2450760 So you wanna come by<br />and help me train?
2450960 2452320 I got a job here.
2452720 2454240 I understand.
2454640 2457400 Remember you said if you stay<br />one place long enough...
2457560 2458840 ...you become that place?
2459480 2461640 Rocko, this is all I got.
2462080 2464480 I understand, Paulie. I do.
2468880 2472720 If you get time and come down<br />and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
2473680 2475560 Of course, Rocko.
2478600 2480200 Bye, Paulie.
2480440 2480880 Goodbye, Rocko.
2480880 2482440 Goodbye, Rocko.
2485000 2486920 Take care, Rocko.
2492040 2495520 <i>This plenary session of the<br />Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...</i>
2495680 2501000 ...is convened in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa...
2501200 2505240 ...for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing license...
2505400 2510000 ...due to his ineligibility to be<br />licensed as a matter of right.
2510160 2513960 Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself...
2514160 2517160 ...we invite you to make an opening<br />statement, if you'd like to.
2517320 2519760 No, I was just curious how I did,<br />that's all.
2519920 2524280 All right, well, the Medical<br />Advisory Board has informed us...
2524440 2527240 ...that the battery of tests<br />to which you've been subjected...
2527440 2530560 ...you've passed these tests<br />with flying colors.
2530800 2533200 And we congratulate you for that.
2533360 2536160 - Thanks.<br />- However, this commission...
2536320 2539920 ...in good conscience,<br />cannot recommend you for a license...
2540320 2543400 ...and we therefore deny<br />your application.
2544680 2547360 - Didn't I do what you asked?<br />- Yes, you did.
2547520 2549160 So I should get a license, right?
2549480 2550600 Not exactly.
2553520 2556880 So why did you give me all them tests<br />if you was never passing me?
2557040 2558960 We've gotta stand by<br />our decision here...
2559120 2562320 ...and we have to deny your request<br />for a license at this time.
2574120 2576600 Yo, don't I got some rights?
2576760 2578760 What rights do you think<br />you're referring to?
2578960 2581480 Like in that official paper<br />they wrote down the street?
2581680 2583520 - That's the Bill of Rights.<br />- Bill of Rights.
2583680 2585800 Don't it say something about going<br />after what makes you happy?
2586000 2588640 No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."<br />But what's your point?
2588800 2591920 My point is I'm pursuing something,<br />and nobody looks too happy about it.
2592240 2594480 But we're just looking out<br />for your interests.
2594640 2598160 I appreciate that, but maybe you're<br />looking out for your interests more.
2598320 2601520 You shouldn't ask people to come here<br />and pay the freight on something.
2601680 2604720 They pay, it still ain't good enough.<br />You think that's right?
2604880 2608040 Maybe you're doing your job, but why<br />you gotta stop me from doing mine?
2608560 2612240 If you're willing to go through all the<br />battling to get where you want to get...
2612400 2614080 ...who's got the right to stop you?
2614240 2617520 Maybe you got something you never<br />finished, something you wanna do.
2617680 2619840 Something you never said<br />to somebody, something!
2620000 2622040 And you're told no,<br />even after you pay your dues.
2622200 2624680 Who's got the right<br />to tell you that? Who? Nobody!
2624880 2627880 It's your right to listen to your gut.<br />It's nobody's right to say no...
2628080 2631320 ...after you earn the right to be what you<br />wanna be or do what you wanna do!
2635400 2639320 The older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.
2639480 2643880 The only thing I'm asking you guys<br />to leave on the table is what's right.
2660560 2662280 Yo! Have you seen<br />the paper today?
2662480 2664520 Front row. Front row.
2665800 2666800 That is so great.
2667000 2669400 - All right, all right.<br />- Let's go get some food. Food.
2669560 2673240 - Let's get a beer. Come on.<br />- Come on.
2673680 2675680 The last two pay-per-views<br />were in the toilet.
2675840 2678320 You're not making<br />heavyweight-championship money.
2678480 2680400 There's a bunch of nobodies<br />out there, Mase.
2680560 2683440 I wanna talk to you about an<br />opportunity we should run with.
2683600 2687280 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a license and got one?
2687440 2689280 - I heard. Forget about him.<br />- Hear me out.
2689440 2692680 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands tied behind my back.
2692840 2696040 Everybody knows you could beat him<br />sitting down. That's not what it's about.
2696240 2699360 It's about making money. We gotta<br />capitalize on that computer fight.
2699520 2702120 This could do a million buys.<br />That's 15, 20 million to you.
2702320 2704200 - Forget it.<br />- No one's beating the door down...
2704400 2706920 ...to watch you fight anymore.<br />- We got guaranteed fights.
2707120 2709960 You wanna do this now in front<br />of your friends, we'll do it now.
2710120 2713440 We got nothing. All the pay-per-view<br />fights you come up with got rejected.
2713600 2716960 You know why? They're all bums<br />out there. Nobody cares about them.
2717360 2720960 There's no marquee value.<br />But this Balboa thing is interesting.
2721240 2722720 - I don't wanna do it.<br />- Listen to me.
2722920 2726640 It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.<br />Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...
2726800 2729880 ...but people relate to that stuff.<br />This is a no-lose. It's all good.
2730320 2732840 - Good for who?<br />- For you! Not for me! For you!
2733160 2735960 Maybe you don't understand.<br />People don't like you no more.
2736120 2739440 They don't follow you. They're not<br />supporting you anymore. Understand?
2739600 2741640 Don't look at me like<br />I'm messing with your legacy.
2741840 2743480 Every jock now thinks<br />they got a legacy.
2743640 2746440 A legacy is what you get instead<br />of getting paid. That's a legacy.
2746640 2749080 - Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />- I'm not no more.
2749240 2752640 Everybody knows you could kick<br />this old man's ass. But you don't.
2752840 2754760 Leave him with a little<br />dignity, so they say:
2754960 2758280 "Mason Dixon's got compassion.<br />He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."
2758480 2760760 You get a whole new audience,<br />we'll double your money.
2760920 2762880 You want a new image?<br />That's how you get it.
2763080 2764720 To replace the one<br />that you two made?
2764880 2767600 Whoa, wait. We made your<br />world green. You made the rest.
2767760 2769680 This is you.<br />You made all this junk happen.
2769840 2771440 I've had it up to here with this mess.
2771600 2774000 Time for me to make changes.<br />I'm going to Martin's gym.
2774160 2775840 - We'll talk about it.<br />- Forget this crap.
2776000 2778280 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.
2788560 2790240 - How you doing?<br />- Hey, what a surprise.
2790400 2792680 I was driving around<br />the neighborhood, I thought...
2792880 2795400 ...why not drive by and say hello?<br />- You wanna come inside?
2795560 2798440 No, the dog needs some exercise.<br />You wanna take a little walk?
2798640 2800920 - Yeah, yeah. All right.<br />- It's nice outside.
2801080 2803520 - All right.<br />- Nice and brisk.
2803720 2804840 When did you get a dog?
2805040 2807040 We picked up Punchy<br />a couple of days back.
2807200 2808360 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah.
2808520 2809680 You named your dog Punchy?
2809840 2811480 Your kid come up with the name.
2811640 2813960 Oh, yeah?<br />I think that's disrespectful.
2814160 2815840 Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.
2816000 2819160 No, it's easy to remember<br />and it's all that, you know.
2819320 2822200 Listen, what do you think about<br />coming over to the restaurant?
2822360 2825280 - What for?<br />- Well, you know, for, like...
2825440 2828720 For work. The hostess is gonna<br />be having a kid. You'd do good.
2828880 2831320 - I don't know.<br />- I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
2831480 2833840 I appreciate what you're doing<br />for my kid, but I can't.
2834000 2836360 Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.
2836560 2838880 It's a nice environment,<br />it's very pleasant.
2839040 2841000 Yeah, can we drop it?
2843400 2844800 What's bothering you?
2845000 2847120 Nothing. It's all right.<br />Listen, I gotta get back.
2848520 2850360 - No, it ain't all right.<br />- Oh, come on.
2850680 2852480 - What?<br />- I'm gonna be the first person...
2852640 2854960 ...people see when they walk in?<br />- You give out menus.
2855120 2857800 You say, "Hello, how are you?"<br />You sit people down.
2857960 2860120 Look, if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.
2860280 2863400 You could find 10 better people,<br />a hundred better people for this job.
2863600 2865320 Give it a try, like two weeks.
2865520 2867240 I don't wanna try.
2867400 2869520 - Who put this stuff in your head?<br />- Nobody.
2869680 2871600 Well, it just don't<br />get in there by itself.
2875040 2876880 Thanks for coming by.
2878720 2883040 Yo, when was the last time you<br />went dancing? Has it been a while?
2883200 2885000 - Why are you asking?<br />- I'm asking because...
2885160 2888280 ...you dance around these problems,<br />you might as well dance with me.
2888440 2891360 I ain't that good,<br />but I'm better than the average bear.
2891520 2894080 Where that came from, I don't know.
2894680 2896080 - You're crazy.<br />- A little bit.
2896240 2899400 But the way you're thinking<br />and talking, it's a little crazy too.
2900240 2903720 Come on, you deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
2903880 2907920 I need you to class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
2908280 2911800 And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"<br />again, I totally understand.
2911960 2914280 But I'm warning you,<br />I'm gonna put myself...
2914480 2916240 ...in the middle of the street here...
2916400 2919240 ...and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />and wave to the first bus, say:
2919400 2921040 "Come on over here and mash me!
2921200 2923560 Little Marie turned down<br />the job at the restaurant.
2923760 2925360 She thinks she's better than us."
2925520 2928680 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
2929280 2931200 - Yeah?<br />- No.
2933200 2934760 That was a close call.
2935760 2940560 Listen, seriously. Come on over.<br />It'd be nice.
2943120 2944480 All right.
2962000 2963480 Paulie!
2966680 2968400 Sorry, Paulie.
2969760 2971400 Sorry.
3001360 3004360 How are you?<br />Get my unusual up there.
3004560 3007200 Excuse me.<br />Deliveries are in the back.
3007360 3009000 I'm not a delivery guy.
3009160 3010880 Well, do you have a reservation?
3011040 3013640 Do I look like a freaking Indian?
3016520 3018720 Hey, Rock? Rocky?
3023440 3026080 I think we've got a little bit<br />of a problem with this guy.
3026240 3028480 Problem?<br />No, no, he's just a relative.
3028640 3030800 Oh, okay.
3033240 3034600 Yo, Paulie.
3036800 3038720 - What happened to your eye?<br />- I hit it.
3039000 3040720 - Why?<br />- Needed to.
3041360 3042600 What happened?
3042800 3045400 - I'm celebrating, Rock.<br />- Why?
3045560 3047880 - I retired.<br />- Retired?
3053520 3056000 So when did they start<br />giving retired people meat...
3056160 3058240 ...instead of watches, Paulie?
3060920 3062800 I don't need a watch.
3064560 3067840 I got a watch! You gave me a watch!
3068040 3069240 Paulie...
3069400 3071840 I don't need no goddamn watch.
3073400 3076400 - Yo, Paulie.<br />- I got a watch!
3077680 3079560 I got two watches!
3080040 3082120 Yo, Paulie!
3093960 3094920 Yo, Paulie.
3096520 3097920 Rock.
3098240 3102440 It takes guts climbing back in that ring,<br />knowing you're gonna take a beating.
3105040 3106880 You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
3107120 3108400 How do you know that?
3110240 3112680 The stuff in the basement.
3123240 3124880 Thanks, Paulie.
3129480 3132280 - Hey.<br />- Hey, Rock, how are you?
3133600 3135640 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, good. How are you?
3135800 3137360 - Yeah, fine. This is great.<br />- Good.
3137520 3140080 Listen, some guys over there<br />wanna talk to you.
3140240 3142920 - Okay. You got it.<br />- Okay?
3146240 3148840 - Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.<br />- Our pleasure.
3149000 3150880 - Wanna hear stories?<br />- What kind of stories?
3151120 3153680 Well, a lot of people like to hear<br />these old fight stories.
3153840 3155240 - Maybe later.<br />- Okay.
3155400 3159680 I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixon's manager.
3159920 3162200 - Will you sit down and join us?<br />- Sure.
3163720 3166400 You know, we have the promotional<br />contract for Mason Dixon...
3166560 3168000 ...who's a big fan.<br />- Really?
3168200 3170240 When he heard you were<br />interested in fighting...
3170400 3172520 ...he thought why not try<br />to work something out?
3172680 3175600 Like a special event.<br />Like a first-class exhibition fight.
3177080 3179080 - Why me?<br />- He respects the hell out of you.
3179280 3183040 All right? And let's be honest,<br />that computer fight got people curious.
3183240 3185560 - This could be very interesting.<br />- I ain't interested...
3185720 3187760 ...in getting, like,<br />mangled and embarrassed.
3187920 3190000 No, that's not gonna happen.<br />Never happen.
3190160 3194160 Truthfully, I was thinking<br />more on a, like...
3194560 3198000 ...miniscule, small level.<br />You know. Small fights, not big fights.
3198280 3202040 Small fights. Things that...<br />Local. You know what I mean?
3202200 3205600 Not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big.<br />Think of it like an exhibition.
3205760 3209160 Think of it as a glorified sparring<br />session. Here's something you'll like.
3209360 3211760 We're gonna donate a portion<br />of the gate to charity.
3211920 3213920 - That's always nice.<br />- It's good to give.
3214120 3215520 Yeah.
3215920 3217440 Where's it taking place?
3217640 3218920 - Las Vegas.<br />- Las Vegas.
3219120 3222200 Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killing you.
3222400 3224680 - Little stiff.<br />- You move better when you're warmer.
3225240 3226800 - Yeah.<br />- And if nothing else...
3226960 3228960 ...you'll have new stories to tell.
3229240 3231960 - I really gotta think about this.<br />- Absolutely.
3232120 3234440 - Is that okay?<br />- I understand. No problem.
3234800 3236880 I'm gonna go over there.<br />You can order something.
3237040 3239040 - What do you recommend?<br />- It's all edible.
3241840 3244360 Okay. Thanks.
3244920 3248600 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime?
3248760 3251120 - He'd kill him. Kill him.<br />- You ain't kidding.
3251640 3253920 Man, I'm confused.
3260840 3262640 I didn't think this was gonna<br />come along.
3262800 3264360 But this is what you wanted, right?
3264560 3266760 I don't know.<br />You know, I talk and I talk.
3266920 3268920 Sometimes I think<br />what I'm saying is true...
3269080 3273240 ...and then I look at myself and I'm<br />not even sure what is true anymore.
3273400 3276280 Because it's like, I pushed<br />this crazy idea about fighting.
3276440 3277920 I mean, what's it all about?
3278120 3280920 Do I really care about standing<br />toe to toe and all that stuff...
3281080 3284520 ...or, like my kid says,<br />is it just, like, ego?
3284720 3288320 Or am I this old pug who's just trying<br />to replace old pain with new pain?
3288480 3290960 I don't know. I don't know.
3292680 3295320 Look, I know<br />I usually don't say a lot.
3295480 3299360 I'm always listening and looking.
3299560 3304280 But who you are, the part of you<br />that's so full of life...
3304440 3306400 ...we all have that feeling, that fire...
3306600 3310880 ...but usually never get a chance<br />to use it. And then it just goes away.
3311080 3315800 But you can. You've got this<br />opportunity, so do it. Why not?
3315960 3320080 I mean, this is who you are.<br />This is who you'll always be.
3320240 3323400 And you don't move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.
3323560 3326280 And it doesn't matter<br />how this looks to other people.
3326440 3328640 All that matters<br />is how it looks to you.
3330720 3332160 Rocky.
3333360 3335240 Rocky, look at me.
3336320 3339600 How it looks to you.
3340560 3342480 And if this is something<br />that you wanna do...
3342640 3346520 ...and if this is something that<br />you gotta do, then you do it.
3347880 3349480 Fighters fight.
3353040 3355400 You're not gonna punch me,<br />are you?
3358840 3362320 Listen, I gotta go before I wear out<br />my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
3363720 3365000 Thanks.
3375400 3377600 Fighters fight, right?
3383600 3387360 It's rare when you get to promote<br />an event bigger than boxing. This is.
3387560 3391160 Skill versus will, with part<br />of the proceeds going to charity.
3391320 3395360 The brainchild of Mason Dixon,<br />to honor past heavyweight champions.
3395520 3398600 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
3398800 3399920 Hey, champ!
3400080 3403920 A few great fighters have fought in<br />their 50s, often with disastrous results.
3404080 3405680 Why risk the danger<br />and embarrassment?
3405840 3408200 The smart money says<br />you have virtually no chance.
3408360 3412240 A puncher always has a chance.<br />This fight will be competitive.
3413640 3415520 Why are you doing this, Rocky?
3415720 3419720 <i>I don't know, I'd rather do<br />something I love badly than...</i>
3419880 3424280 <i>Than to feel bad by not<br />doing something you love.</i>
3425040 3427560 Rocky, the press has labeled you<br />a Balboasaurus.
3429360 3430960 How do you feel about that?
3431120 3434920 Let's say the following happens:<br />You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
3435080 3438440 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
3438600 3441880 You all know that will never happen.<br />This is only an exhibition.
3442040 3445320 Don't go trying to make more out<br />of this than that computer tried.
3447120 3450560 Isn't this sport in enough trouble<br />without these circus events?
3450880 3453080 - Next question.<br />- On the surface, this looks like...
3453240 3455560 ...a cheap bit of ring theater<br />between, no offense...
3455720 3458120 ...a has-been and a man<br />whose own credible legacy...
3458320 3459720 ...and popularity is in doubt.
3459880 3461480 - What's the upside?<br />- Doubt?
3461640 3464040 Upside? I mean...
3464240 3467720 What do you mean, upside?<br />I mean, what do I have to do?
3468920 3471080 You know, I'm 33-0<br />with 30 knockouts.
3471360 3474160 I'm doing you people a favor.<br />I'm having this exhibition for you.
3474320 3477200 You gonna get up here and make<br />a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.
3477840 3479920 I mean, I get pissed,<br />this guy get hurt.
3480840 3482440 See you at the fight.
3486360 3488520 The guy's a joke.<br />He's gonna get crushed.
3497880 3499560 - Look who's here.<br />- How you doing?
3499720 3501880 - Have you seen my father?<br />- He's in the back.
3502040 3504760 This place has never served<br />this many meals. It's unbelievable.
3504920 3508840 You're doing good? Hope you're<br />enjoying everything, all right?
3511000 3512480 Excuse me.
3514080 3517480 How you doing? Glad you come by.
3518040 3519120 Can I talk with you?
3519400 3521800 - Sure.<br />- Can we do it outside?
3526480 3529160 - So you're going through with this?<br />- I start training tomorrow.
3529360 3532440 Hey, Rock.<br />I made some connections.
3532600 3534880 I can make some money<br />on this, endorsements.
3536000 3537160 Absolutely. Do that.
3537520 3539880 - Thank you, Rock. Okay.<br />- Sure.
3540520 3543800 - So you nervous about the fight?<br />- Scared to death.
3543960 3546600 - You don't look scared.<br />- Well, I ain't supposed to.
3546760 3549040 Then you don't have to do it.
3549200 3551400 Yeah, well, I think I do.
3554400 3557440 You know, living with you,<br />it hasn't been easy.
3557600 3560120 People see me<br />but they think of you.
3560280 3563000 Now with all this going on,<br />it's gonna be worse than ever.
3563160 3565000 - It don't have to be.<br />- Sure it does!
3565200 3567800 - Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.<br />- What, my last name?
3567960 3569800 That's the reason I got a decent job.
3570000 3572080 That's why people deal with me<br />in the first place.
3572240 3573840 Now I start to get a little ahead...
3574000 3577800 ...I start to get a little something<br />for myself, and this happens.
3577960 3581080 Now, I'm asking you as a favor<br />not to go through with this.
3581240 3584280 This is gonna end up bad for you,<br />and it's gonna end up bad for me.
3584440 3587080 - You think I'm hurting you?<br />- Yeah. In a way, you are.
3587400 3589160 That's the last thing<br />I ever wanted to do.
3589320 3592640 I know that's not what you wanna do,<br />but that's just the way that it is.
3592800 3595760 Don't you care what people think?<br />Doesn't it bother you that people...
3595920 3598880 ...are making you out to be a joke<br />and that I'll be included in that?
3599040 3601920 Do you think that's right? Do you?
3607720 3612440 You ain't gonna believe this,<br />but you used to fit right here.
3612600 3614760 I'd hold you up<br />and say to your mother:
3614920 3617360 "This kid is gonna be<br />the best kid in the world.
3617520 3620640 This kid is gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew."
3620800 3623520 And you grew up<br />good and wonderful.
3623680 3626680 It was great just watching,<br />every day was like a privilege.
3626840 3629920 Then the time come for you to be<br />your own man and take on the world...
3630080 3634400 ...and you did. But somewhere<br />along the line, you changed.
3634600 3635800 You stopped being you.
3635960 3639120 You let people stick a finger in<br />your face and tell you you're no good.
3639280 3642800 And when things got hard, you started<br />looking for something to blame...
3642960 3644960 ...like a big shadow.
3646400 3648560 Let me tell you something<br />you already know.
3648720 3650960 The world ain't all<br />sunshine and rainbows.
3651120 3654800 It's a very mean and nasty place,<br />and I don't care how tough you are...
3654960 3658400 ...it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there if you let it.
3659040 3662880 You, me or nobody<br />is gonna hit as hard as life.
3663040 3667000 But it ain't about how hard you hit.<br />It's about how hard you can get hit...
3667160 3668520 ...and keep moving forward.
3668680 3671720 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
3671880 3674200 That's how winning is done!
3674640 3677280 If you know what you're worth,<br />go and get what you're worth.
3677440 3680560 But you gotta be willing to take<br />the hits, and not pointing fingers...
3680720 3684680 ...saying you ain't where you wanna be<br />because of him or her or anybody!
3684840 3688880 Cowards do that, and that ain't you!<br />You're better than that!
3695360 3698560 I'm always gonna love you<br />no matter what.
3698720 3700520 No matter what happens.
3700840 3703560 You're my son and you're my blood.
3703720 3706360 You're the best thing in my life.
3707560 3711240 But until you start believing in<br />yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.
3715920 3718280 Don't forget to visit your mother.
3766120 3768640 - Yeah, those are beautiful.<br />- Yeah.
3770520 3773480 - You get off early from work?<br />- No.
3773920 3775360 I left.
3775960 3777440 I quit.
3778160 3779400 Quit, why?
3780760 3783040 I wasn't very...
3783640 3786640 I don't know, I just...<br />I didn't fit in there.
3788600 3789960 I understand.
3794440 3797600 - So, what are you gonna do?<br />- Right now?
3799040 3801520 Right now I'd rather be with you.
3803760 3805480 Is that all right?
3806760 3808520 Yeah.
3808840 3811560 It's been a long time<br />since I seen a fight.
3822920 3822960 You know all there is<br />to know about fighting...
3822960 3825040 You know all there is<br />to know about fighting...
3825200 3828240 ...so there's no sense us going down<br />that same old road again.
3828400 3832360 To beat this guy, you need speed.<br />You don't have it.
3833800 3837600 And your knees can't take the<br />pounding, so hard running is out.
3837760 3841320 And you got arthritis in your neck.<br />And you've got calcium deposits...
3841480 3844680 ...on most of your joints,<br />so sparring is out.
3845560 3846960 I had that problem.
3847840 3852840 So what we'll be calling on is good<br />old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.
3853000 3857480 Horsepower. Heavy-duty,<br />cast-iron, pile-driving punches...
3857640 3860520 ...that will have to hurt so much<br />they'll rattle his ancestors.
3861080 3862760 Every time you hit him with a shot...
3862920 3865760 ...it's gotta feel like he tried kissing<br />the express train.
3867040 3870800 Yeah! Let's start building<br />some hurting bombs.
3901800 3904520 - Yeah, you'll get it.<br />- You can do it, Rocko!
3938920 3940400 Getting stronger!
3942720 3944360 - Up! Up! Up!<br />- Come on!
3946240 3947440 Go!
3952360 3955080 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
3957680 3959040 Come on, Rocko!
3966120 3968360 Come on. Come on.<br />Let's hit them. Hit them.
3973640 3974920 You can do it, Rock.
3977920 3979080 Getting stronger!
3989640 3992400 - Up, up, up!<br />- Go! Go!
3993520 3994920 All right!
3995440 3996680 Yeah! Yeah!
4015560 4017120 Yeah!
4026520 4030400 Rocky Balboa, 217!
4031120 4037000 The undisputed heavyweight<br />champion, Mason Dixon, 221!
4039880 4042760 Thank you very much.<br />I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
4048640 4053120 <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
4058440 4060440 - Know how much money is in this?<br />- A lot of it.
4060600 4062880 Imagine trying to clean this place.
4063040 4064360 - No, seriously.<br />- Balboa!
4067880 4070560 You guys, I'll catch up<br />with you all later, okay?
4070720 4072840 Robert, why don't<br />you hang with me?
4073960 4076760 - How you doing, champ?<br />- I'm good.
4078200 4080720 No reason for neither one of us<br />to get hurt in this fight.
4080880 4083760 I'll do my best to carry you,<br />make sure you save face.
4083920 4085640 There'd be no embarrassment.
4085800 4089960 But I promise you, you try to press me,<br />you hit me, you hurt me...
4090120 4093520 ...you hit me low, cheap-shot me,<br />I'll get you out of there.
4094920 4098920 You know, a lot of people come<br />to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
4099080 4100360 It's already over.
4100520 4102320 Ain't nothing over till it's over.
4102480 4104080 What's that from, the '80s?
4104240 4106520 That's probably the '70s.
4109280 4110720 Just remember what I said.
4112200 4114120 Hey, yo, champ.
4114360 4115920 Yo, ain't you a little scared?
4116840 4118600 I don't get scared.
4121560 4123880 I think you try a little harder<br />when you're scared.
4124480 4127560 This is what has worked for me.
4128240 4130520 - I ain't scared.<br />- Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?
4130680 4133000 Come on, let's see what you got.<br />Come on.
4133160 4134520 Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
4149560 4151200 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
4151360 4152960 - How you doing?<br />- I was just thinking.
4153120 4155320 - Did you wanna come in?<br />- No, no, no, it's okay.
4155480 4157560 I just wanted to...
4157720 4160400 ...I don' t know, come by and wish you<br />good luck for tomorrow.
4160560 4162320 - Thanks.<br />- Yeah.
4162480 4164360 I brought you something.
4164520 4166760 I hope you don't mind,<br />I took it from the restaurant.
4166920 4168680 - No.<br />- Thanks.
4168840 4170520 Adrian.
4170680 4173320 Yeah. Thought she would<br />keep you safe.
4173480 4175840 Yeah. Yeah, she always<br />brought me luck.
4176000 4177640 Yeah.
4178320 4183200 I wanted to say thanks for everything<br />you've done for me and my kid.
4183920 4185800 You've been great and...
4190000 4191840 You know, tomorrow...
4193240 4197080 ...you're gonna prove that the last thing<br />to age on somebody is their heart.
4199040 4201160 - I'll try.<br />- You go show them.
4201320 4202920 Thank you.

4240520 4243800 <i>... over the years against<br />physically superior opponents.</i>
4243960 4246440 <i>And Mason Dixon, the current<br />heavyweight title holder...</i>
4246600 4249840 <i>... with all the speed, determination<br />and confidence any fighter could want.</i>
4250000 4253800 <i>But many still question whether<br />he has the heart of a true champion...</i>
4253960 4257640 <i>... never having been pushed to go<br />the distance. Tonight, we find out.</i>
4259160 4261520 <i>Here at the Mandalay Bay<br />Event Center in Las Vegas...</i>
4261680 4263440 <i>... for the much-anticipated<br />showdown...</i>
4263600 4265480 <i>... between Mason<br />"The Line" Dixon...</i>
4265640 4268400 <i>... and Rocky<br />"The Italian Stallion" Balboa.</i>
4268880 4271720 Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with<br />Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...
4271880 4274920 ...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel<br />in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...
4275080 4278160 ...one of the most outrageous and<br />compelling events in boxing history.
4278320 4281920 The unappreciated heavyweight<br />champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...
4282080 4283760 <i>... putting his reputation<br />on the line...</i>
4285040 4286760 <i>... against legendary ex-champion,<br />Rocky Balboa.</i>
4288040 4291000 <i>Even though most see this as more<br />of a glorified sparring session...</i>
4291160 4293040 ...the energy in the room is electric.
4293200 4295200 Larry, why is this billed<br />as an exhibition?
4295400 4299400 Wild guess: So they wouldn't<br />have to call it an execution.
4300160 4305160 Zacariah 4:6 says,<br />"It is not by strength, not by might...
4305320 4308920 ...but by his spirit<br />we have already claimed the victory...
4309080 4311680 ...in our Lord Jesus Christ."
4312280 4313920 Good luck, Rocky.
4314080 4316240 Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.
4326920 4330040 Nobody's expecting much, I think,<br />from the way-past-his-prime...
4330200 4332200 ...former champ, Rocky Balboa.
4332680 4335800 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
4336520 4342120 Look, I know you got a lot of stuff<br />you gotta get out of your system.
4343000 4347360 Tonight you do it. Right?<br />Get rid of the damn beast...
4347560 4352200 ...let it be done, once and for all.<br />Please, I love you.
4353040 4356520 <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
4361160 4365360 There go the lights. The buzz is<br />building toward a roaring crescendo.
4380640 4382720 Where did that come from?
4382920 4385760 I told you. I love Sinatra.
4386440 4388360 He's very good, Sinatra.
4388520 4391440 - Let's go.<br />- Very good.
4393600 4397920 And here comes Rocky Balboa,<br />veteran of the wars...
4398120 4400680 ...here for one more last hurrah.
4400840 4403640 Or the Last Supper, perhaps,<br />with him as the main course.
4403800 4406320 What's that music?<br />You can't be serious.
4406480 4409120 "High Hopes"?<br />Talk about wishful thinking.
4409320 4412640 Well, maybe no hopes is more<br />realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.
4413440 4416520 Look at the Italian Stallion.<br />Cool and relaxed.
4416680 4420240 Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,<br />and they don't care at all.
4420400 4424040 This is about his pride and dignity<br />and his punch, guys.
4424240 4426680 The last thing to go<br />is a guy's punch.
4426840 4430160 Rocky always has<br />that puncher's chance.
4434320 4438240 Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,<br />the people's champion.
4438440 4440760 Prediction, guys:<br />For at least two rounds...
4440920 4442600 ...Dixon's gonna have<br />his hands full.
4442760 4446600 Two whole rounds? We have<br />a cockeyed optimist in the house.
4447560 4449320 - How you doing?<br />- The crowd wants to see...
4449480 4451040 ...something real, or at least...
4451240 4453160 Rocky Balboa just asked me<br />how I'm doing.
4453320 4457800 I grew up watching this guy. I never<br />thought I'd be calling one of his fights.
4458280 4460880 This is unbelievable.<br />I'm a fan, I can't help it.
4461040 4463560 Now here comes Mason Dixon.
4496400 4498760 Mason Dixon establishing<br />his presence in the ring.
4498920 4502560 And suddenly now a conversation<br />breaking out at ringside.
4502720 4505320 Mike Tyson calling out<br />Mason "The Line" Dixon.
4505480 4507920 You can't call no shots here.<br />I'm the champ.
4508080 4510360 You not doing nothing.<br />This is charity work.
4510520 4513440 You got that midget<br />with you right there.
4517960 4521320 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />welcome to the Mandalay Bay...
4522880 4525280 ...resort and casino of Las Vegas.
4525480 4528800 And a special main event<br />of the evening...
4528960 4532120 ...10 rounds of<br />heavyweight excitement...
4532280 4534600 ...sanctioned by the Nevada<br />State Athletic Commission.
4534760 4538480 And when the bell rings, the referee<br />in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
4540200 4543200 And now, for the thousands<br />in attendance...
4543360 4548840 ...and the millions watching around<br />the world, ladies and gentlemen...
4549000 4554360 ...let's get ready to rumble!
4556680 4559720 Introducing first,<br />fighting out of the blue corner...
4559880 4564360 ...wearing black with gold,<br />official weight, 217 pounds.
4564520 4568960 His professional record, 57 victories<br />including 54 knockouts...
4569160 4572040 ...with 23 defeats and one draw.
4572200 4575240 He is the fighting pride<br />of Philadelphia...
4575520 4579720 ...the two-time heavyweight<br />champion of the world...
4579880 4581880 ..."The Italian Stallion"...
4582040 4586440 ...Rocky...
4586600 4588880 ...Balboa!
4591800 4593320 Hope he gets his head busted.
4595280 4597160 Shut up.
4599800 4602480 Across the ring,<br />fighting out of the red corner...
4602640 4606280 ...wearing white with blue,<br />official weight, 221 pounds.
4606520 4611320 He has a perfect professional record,<br />consisting of 33 bouts...
4611480 4614600 ...33 victories,<br />including 30 knockouts.
4614760 4616680 Originally from Tampa, Florida...
4616840 4619720 ...but now fighting out<br />of Las Vegas, Nevada...
4619880 4624040 ...the reigning undisputed,<br />undefeated...
4624200 4627080 ...heavyweight champion<br />of the world...
4627240 4630560 ...Mason "The Line"...
4630760 4634560 ...Dixon!
4638520 4640120 All right, gentlemen.
4640280 4643520 All right, Mason, Rocky. We went<br />over the rules in the dressing room.
4643680 4647520 I expect a good, clean fight. Watch<br />the kidney punches, rabbit punches...
4647720 4650760 ...low blows, be careful with those.<br />Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
4650920 4654480 Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair<br />but I'm firm. Touch them up!
4654640 4657120 - Enjoy the ride.<br />- The champ is not in the best shape...
4657280 4660440 ...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans<br />to phone this in and go home early.
4660600 4662920 - That wouldn't be a surprise.<br />- Glad you could make it.
4663080 4665600 One thing about Rocky<br />we know for sure:
4665800 4667920 This guy's showing up in shape.
4668080 4670800 - The old man's crazy.<br />- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
4670960 4672840 - Okay.<br />- Take it easy. This is an exhibition.
4673000 4674400 All right? Do it to him.
4674560 4677640 You got three rounds to set a pace.<br />Every time you hit him, make a dent.
4677800 4679680 - Got it.<br />- The moments before...
4679840 4683200 ...a Rocky Balboa fight?<br />I can't believe it's here!
4684280 4685480 Round one begins.
4685640 4689160 If old George Foreman shocked<br />the world with one punch...
4689320 4691360 ...why can't old Rocky Balboa?
4691560 4693800 And as much excitement<br />as there is in the arena...
4693960 4696200 ...there's a sense of foreboding<br />as well.
4700360 4703880 And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />goes to work with his jab as though...
4704040 4707760 ...he's fighting against the number one<br />challenger in the heavyweight division.
4708200 4710000 See, this is to be expected early on.
4710160 4712760 You knew the champ would<br />control the distance with his jab...
4712920 4714880 ...his height, his range.
4716200 4719160 Balboa looking to get in a shot,<br />misses wildly.
4719320 4721080 Did you like that?
4721520 4724520 It looks like a speed bag<br />against a punching bag.
4724720 4726240 Rocky's understandably frustrated...
4726440 4728680 ...but he came out of retirement<br />to get into a fight.
4728840 4731280 Guys named Rocky<br />don't like to be toyed with.
4731440 4733080 One punch could still turn it around.
4733280 4736240 Apparently he forgot<br />his arthritis meds this morning.
4736520 4737960 Rocky misses.
4738280 4741880 There's a meat-seeking missile<br />on the point of the chin by the champ.
4742040 4744680 <i>- More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.<br />- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
4744840 4748040 And there's a hard right hand<br />and a left and a right by Balboa!
4748200 4751040 He drives Dixon into the ropes<br />with a series of shots!
4751200 4753520 And the crowd goes berserk!
4758160 4762280 Dixon punishing Balboa for<br />the temerity of landing those shots.
4765640 4770040 It's toe to toe in the corner.<br />Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
4776520 4779240 Balboa landing potent combinations<br />to the head of the champion.
4779560 4780760 A wake-up call for Dixon.
4780920 4782480 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm all right.
4782640 4785720 - The man's got bricks in his gloves.<br />- Where's the stuff in the basement?
4785880 4788000 - It's still there.<br />- He came to battle, okay?
4788160 4789560 - Trying to knock me out.<br />- Listen.
4789720 4792040 If there's a bone he can break,<br />he's gonna do it.
4792200 4794440 - Give the man respect.<br />- What about my respect?
4794600 4797320 CompuBox numbers<br />tell the grisly story here.
4797480 4800400 Balboa landed nine of 13<br />punches in that round.
4800560 4805520 Dixon landed an incredible<br />59 out of 69.
4805680 4809000 - Why don't you listen to me?<br />- Rocky's been here a million times.
4809160 4812240 Coming out to start a round after<br />he took a beating in the previous one.
4812400 4815440 - Remember what I said, okay?<br />- I warned him. I warned him.
4816480 4821200 He's tired. His legs are going fast,<br />or already gone.
4821360 4825760 And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it.
4825920 4830640 The boxing commission, which<br />was criticized for licensing him...
4830800 4834880 ...would be massacred<br />if something happened to Rocky.
4838040 4840600 And a monstrous straight left hand!<br />Down goes Rocky!
4840800 4843000 And that could conceivably<br />be the end of the fight!
4843160 4846840 That could be the exhibition<br />right there. But no. Balboa up.
4847000 4851120 Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue, and Rocky says yes.
4851280 4854040 Even Rocky Balboa could be<br />too brave for his own good.
4854200 4857640 Dixon comes right back to try to<br />finish it. Balboa almost went down!
4857800 4859720 Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
4859880 4862320 As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
4862480 4864960 - Cover up! Cover up!<br />- Open shots at close range.
4865120 4867520 Right and left hands,<br />and down goes Balboa!
4867720 4870920 Perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career!
4871080 4873400 - That should do it.<br />- Three! Four!
4873560 4875800 Five! Six!
4875960 4877520 Get up! Get up!<br />- Seven!
4877680 4879400 Eight! Nine!
4880800 4883880 - How do you feel, man? You okay?<br />- Now Rocky is furious with himself.
4884040 4886520 He convinces Cortez<br />he wants to keep fighting.
4886680 4888480 Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.
4888640 4890640 Rocky waving his arms<br />and saying he's fine.
4890800 4892880 - He wants to go on!<br />- Let it go! Let it go!
4893800 4896720 And Balboa comes back!<br />With a left and a right...
4896880 4900640 ...and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row!
4901800 4904240 Back comes Dixon<br />with brutal left-hand shots.
4904400 4906520 - Dixon hurt his hand there!<br />- Go after him!
4906680 4908280 This is Rocky's best chance!
4908440 4910600 The champ obviously hurt<br />his hand on Rocky's hip!
4910760 4914440 And Balboa immediately going to<br />work to the body! Huge right hook!
4914600 4918000 Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body!<br />These are big punches.
4918240 4921800 <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
4923160 4924160 Yes!
4926520 4930800 Rocky Balboa has knocked the<br />reigning heavyweight champion down!
4930960 4932800 - You hurt him!<br />- Mason "The Line" Dixon...
4932960 4934920 ...has never taken<br />this kind of punishment...
4935080 4937160 ...in his entire professional career!
4937320 4941160 Maybe he's clearing his head, but<br />the body shots really caved in his ribs.
4941320 4943880 Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
4944040 4947440 Another counterhook by Balboa,<br />followed by two more!
4947600 4950000 Dixon fires back his own hooks!<br />Now Rocky's stunned.
4950160 4952600 It's an all-out war along the ropes...
4952760 4957600 ...as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring!
4958280 4959800 Incredible.
4959960 4961560 All right!
4961720 4963440 Welcome to Rockyland.
4967400 4969720 - How's the hand?<br />- My hand's broken.
4971720 4973680 We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
4973840 4976040 It will numb up on you<br />in a few rounds.
4976200 4979680 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
4979840 4982120 Until then, here is Rocky's chance.
4982280 4984920 - No reverse!<br />- Take the pain, champ.
4985080 4987760 Stay on him! Everybody thought<br />this was a joke, including me!
4987920 4990440 Now nobody's laughing!<br />Stay on him! You go get him!
4991200 4993000 Go out strong!
5004360 5005280 Keep him off you!
5009000 5009960 That's it! That's it!
5023840 5025800 You won that round.<br />Break him down.
5031240 5033160 Bomb him! Bomb him!
5038640 5039800 Yeah!
5043560 5045800 Just keep throwing them bombs!
5057080 5058200 Come on.
5065440 5067400 You can do this.
5068240 5070920 Rocko. Rocko.
5079160 5081440 Yeah, come on, go!
5136160 5137960 Go through him! Run over him!
5152760 5153960 Unload on him!
5155720 5156680 Get down, Mason!
5168040 5169920 They're leaving nothing<br />on the table, guys.
5170120 5174440 The fans are still standing. They may<br />not be able to sit down for a week.
5174600 5177280 - You're doing great!<br />- I'm doing better than I thought.
5177440 5181080 - You sure he's okay?<br />- I've had worse.
5181240 5184840 Toe to toe, one round to go. Who<br />would've believed this was possible?
5185000 5187240 - Can you see out of that eye?<br />- Let me talk to him.
5187640 5189600 Don't take any more chances<br />than you have to.
5189760 5192600 There's nothing more to prove, Pop.<br />There's nothing more to prove.
5192760 5194800 I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
5194960 5196480 You can do it, Rocko!
5196680 5198880 - One more round, we go home.<br />- Okay, then do it.
5199040 5202400 There's an old saying that<br />every great champion has...
5202600 5207680 ...one great fight left in him,<br />and Rocky is proving it so far.
5207840 5210920 - Come on. Touch them up.<br />- Rocko! The last round of your life!
5211080 5212640 - Come on, guys.<br />- The last round!
5212840 5215080 Come on. Touch them up, let's go.<br />Touch them up.
5215720 5218520 - You are one crazy old man.<br />- You'll get there.
5218960 5220080 Let's go.
5220360 5223480 Tenth round of a scheduled 10.<br />Who would ever have dreamed...
5223640 5228240 ...that Rocky Balboa would still be<br />in this quote, "exhibition," against...
5228400 5231080 ...the heavyweight champion?<br />- You can do it! Come on!
5231240 5235400 This fight is as though Dixon<br />got on-the-job training in courage.
5236440 5239080 - Cover up! Cover up!<br />- They're both in a pain-free zone!
5239240 5242360 These guys are fighting<br />in another dimension right now!
5242520 5246400 Beyond belief! Balboa just walking<br />straight into Dixon's punches.
5246600 5249080 Target practice for Dixon.
5252360 5254760 They're exchanging right hooks!<br />Balboa's drilled!
5254920 5258000 Here comes Dixon! He's exhausted<br />from just punching the man!
5259800 5261080 Knock this bum out, Mase!
5273120 5276960 <i>What is it you said to the kid?<br />It ain't about how hard you hit.</i>
5277160 5281000 <i>It's about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep moving forward.</i>
5281320 5284840 <i>How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.</i>
5285000 5286760 <i>- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!<br />- Get up.</i>
5286920 5288800 <i>- Let's go! Get up!<br />- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
5289000 5291600 <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
5291840 5293640 <i>Get up.</i>
5313840 5317280 Another monster body shot. Rocky's<br />ancestors must have felt that one.
