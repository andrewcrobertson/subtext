32131 34964 - Yeah, you'll get it.<br />- You can do it, Rocko!
70836 72394 Getting stronger!
74807 76536 - Up! Up! Up!<br />- Come on!
78477 79739 Go!
84850 87683 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
90422 91821 Come on, Rocko!
99231 101529 Come on. Come on.<br />Let's hit them. Hit them.
107072 108369 You can do it, Rock.
111510 112704 Getting stronger!
123755 126622 - Up, up, up!<br />- Go! Go!
127793 129260 All right!
129795 131057 Yeah! Yeah!
150782 152409 Yeah!
162194 166255 Rocky Balboa, 217!
166999 173131 The undisputed heavyweight<br />champion, Mason Dixon, 221!
176141 179133 Thank you very much.<br />I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
185250 189914 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
195460 197553 - Know how much money is in this?<br />- A lot of it.
197729 200095 Imagine trying to clean this place.
200265 201664 - No, seriously.<br />- Balboa!
205337 208101 You guys, I'll catch up<br />with you all later, okay?
208273 210468 Robert, why don't<br />you hang with me?
211643 214578 - How you doing, champ?<br />- I'm good.
216081 218709 No reason for neither one of us<br />to get hurt in this fight.
218884 221876 I'll do my best to carry you,<br />make sure you save face.
222054 223851 There'd be no embarrassment.
224022 228322 But I promise you, you try to press me,<br />you hit me, you hurt me...
228527 232054 ...you hit me low, cheap-shot me,<br />I'll get you out of there.
233498 237662 You know, a lot of people come<br />to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
237869 239166 It's already over.
239338 241238 Ain't nothing over till it's over.
241406 243067 What's that from, the '80s?
243241 245607 That's probably the '70s.
248480 250004 Just remember what I said.
251516 253541 Hey, yo, champ.
253785 255412 Yo, ain't you a little scared?
256388 258219 I don't get scared.
261293 263727 I think you try a little harder<br />when you're scared.
264329 267526 This is what has worked for me.
268266 270632 - I ain't scared.<br />- Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?
270802 273202 Come on, let's see what you got.<br />Come on.
273372 274805 Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
290489 292184 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
292357 294018 - How you doing?<br />- I was just thinking.
294192 296490 - Did you wanna come in?<br />- No, no, no, it's okay.
296661 298822 I just wanted to...
298997 301795 ...I dor t know, come by and wish you<br />good luck for tomorrow.
301967 303798 - Thanks.<br />- Yeah.
303969 305937 I brought you something.
306104 308436 I hope you don't mind,<br />I took it from the restaurant.
308607 310404 - No.<br />- Thanks.
310575 312338 Adrian.
312511 315275 Yeah. Thought she would<br />keep you safe.
315447 317881 Yeah. Yeah, she always<br />brought me luck.
318050 319779 Yeah.
320485 325548 I wanted to say thanks for everything<br />you've done for me and my kid.
326324 328258 You've been great and...
332664 334564 You know, tomorrow...
336034 340027 ...you're gonna prove that the last thing<br />to age on somebody is their heart.
342074 344269 - I'll try.<br />- You go show them.
344443 346104 Thank you.
367332 369129 The heavyweight championship<br />has been...
369301 372862 ...one of sports' most coveted titles<br />for 120 years.
373205 375605 Two-time heavyweight champion<br />Rocky Balboa...
375774 378868 ...the Philadelphia slugger,<br />renowned for his cast-iron jaw...
379044 381808 ...ferocious body attack<br />and will of steel...
382314 385181 ...all of which have carried<br />the smaller fighter to victories...
385350 388751 ...over the years against<br />physically superior opponents.
388920 391514 And Mason Dixon, the current<br />heavyweight title holder...
391690 395057 ...with all the speed, determination<br />and confidence any fighter could want.
395227 399186 But many still question whether<br />he has the heart of a true champion...
399364 403164 ...never having been pushed to go<br />the distance. Tonight, we find out.
404769 407237 Here at the Mandalay Bay<br />Event Center in Las Vegas...
407405 409236 ...for the much-anticipated<br />showdown...
409407 411341 ...between Mason<br />"The Line" Dixon...
411510 414411 ...and Rocky<br />"The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
414913 417848 Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with<br />Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...
418016 421213 ...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel<br />in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...
421386 424583 ...one of the most outrageous and<br />compelling events in boxing history.
424756 428487 The unappreciated heavyweight<br />champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...
428660 430423 ...putting his reputation<br />on the line...
431763 433560 ...against legendary ex-champion,<br />Rocky Balboa.
434900 437960 Even though most see this as more<br />of a glorified sparring session...
438136 440104 ...the energy in the room is electric.
440272 442365 Larry, why is this billed<br />as an exhibition?
442541 446705 Wild guess: So they wouldn't<br />have to call it an execution.
447512 452711 Zacariah 4:6 says,<br />"It is not by strength, not by might...
452884 456650 ...but by his spirit<br />we have already claimed the victory...
456821 459517 ...in our Lord Jesus Christ."
460158 461853 Good luck, Rocky.
462027 464291 Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.
475407 478672 Nobody's expecting much, I think,<br />from the way-past-his-prime...
478843 480936 ...former champ, Rocky Balboa.
481413 484678 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
485450 491286 Look, I know you got a lot of stuff<br />you gotta get out of your system.
492190 496752 Tonight you do it. Right?<br />Get rid of the damn beast...
496928 501763 ...let it be done, once and for all.<br />Please, I love you.
502667 506296 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
511109 515512 There go the lights. The buzz is<br />building toward a roaring crescendo.
531429 533624 Where did that come from?
533798 536790 I told you. I love Sinatra.
537469 539494 He's very good, Sinatra.
539671 542697 - Let's go.<br />- Very good.
544943 549437 And here comes Rocky Balboa,<br />veteran of the wars...
549648 552310 ...here for one more last hurrah.
552484 555419 Or the Last Supper, perhaps,<br />with him as the main course.
555587 558215 What's that music?<br />You can't be serious.
558390 561120 "High Hopes"?<br />Talk about wishful thinking.
561326 564784 Well, maybe no hopes is more<br />realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.
565630 568827 Look at the Italian Stallion.<br />Cool and relaxed.
569000 572731 Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,<br />and they don't care at all.
572904 576670 This is about his pride and dignity<br />and his punch, guys.
576908 579433 The last thing to go<br />is a guy's punch.
579611 583069 Rocky always has<br />that puncher's chance.
587419 591515 Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,<br />the people's champion.
591690 594124 Prediction, guys:<br />For at least two rounds...
594292 596021 ...Dixors gonna have<br />his hands full.
596194 600221 Two whole rounds? We have<br />a cockeyed optimist in the house.
601199 603030 - How you doing?<br />- The crowd wants to see...
603201 604862 ...something real, or at least...
605036 607061 Rocky Balboa just asked me<br />how I'm doing.
607238 611902 I grew up watching this guy. I never<br />thought I'd be calling one of his fights.
612410 615106 This is unbelievable.<br />I'm a fan, I can't help it.
615280 617908 Now here comes Mason Dixon.
652150 654618 Mason Dixon establishing<br />his presence in the ring.
654786 658552 And suddenly now a conversation<br />breaking out at ringside.
658723 661453 Mike Tyson calling out<br />Mason "The Line" Dixon.
661626 664151 You can't call no shots here.<br />I'm the champ.
664329 666695 You not doing nothing.<br />This is charity work.
666865 669925 You got that midget<br />with you right there.
674639 678131 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />welcome to the Mandalay Bay...
679744 682269 ...resort and casino of Las Vegas.
682447 685905 And a special main event<br />of the evening...
686084 689383 ...10 rounds of<br />heavyweight excitement...
689554 691988 ...sanctioned by the Nevada<br />State Athletic Commission.
692157 696025 And when the bell rings, the referee<br />in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
697796 700924 And now, for the thousands<br />in attendance...
701099 706833 ...and the millions watching around<br />the world, ladies and gentlemen...
707005 712568 ...let's get ready to rumble!
714979 718142 Introducing first,<br />fighting out of the blue corner...
718316 723015 ...wearing black with gold,<br />official weight, 217 pounds.
723188 727818 His professional record, 57 victories<br />including 54 knockouts...
727992 731018 ...with 23 defeats and one draw.
731196 734359 He is the fighting pride<br />of Philadelphia...
734632 739001 ...the two-time heavyweight<br />champion of the world...
739170 741263 ..."The Italian Stallion"...
741439 746035 ...R ocky...
746211 748577 ...Balboa!
751616 753208 Hope he gets his head busted.
755253 757187 Shut up.
759958 762756 Across the ring,<br />fighting out of the red corner...
762927 766727 ...wearing white with blue,<br />official weight, 221 pounds.
766965 771959 He has a perfect professional record,<br />consisting of 33 bouts...
772136 775401 ...33 victories,<br />including 30 knockouts.
775573 777541 Originally from Tampa, florida...
777709 780735 ...but now fighting out<br />of Las Vegas, Nevada...
780912 785246 ...the reigning undisputed,<br />undefeated...
785416 788385 ...heavyweight champion<br />of the world...
788553 792045 ...Mason "The Line"...
792223 796182 ...Dixon!
800331 801992 All right, gentlemen.
802166 805533 All right, Mason, Rocky. We went<br />over the rules in the dressing room.
805703 809730 I expect a good, clean fight. Watch<br />the kidney punches, rabbit punches...
809908 813105 ...Iow blows, be careful with those.<br />Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
813278 816975 Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair<br />but I'm firm. Touch them up!
817148 819708 - Enjoy the ride.<br />- The champ is not in the best shape...
819884 823183 ...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans<br />to phone this in and go home early.
823354 825788 - That wouldn't be a surprise.<br />- Glad you could make it.
825957 828585 One thing about Rocky<br />we know for sure:
828760 830990 This guy's showing up in shape.
831162 833995 - The old mars crazy.<br />- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
834165 836099 - Okay.<br />- Take it easy. This is an exhibition.
836267 837734 All right? Do it to him.
837902 841099 You got three rounds to set a pace.<br />Every time you hit him, make a dent.
841272 843240 - Got it.<br />- The moments before...
843408 846900 ...a Rocky Balboa fight?<br />I can't believe it's here!
848046 849274 Round one begins.
849447 853144 If old George foreman shocked<br />the world with one punch...
853318 855445 ...why can't old Rocky Balboa?
855620 857952 And as much excitement<br />as there is in the arena...
858122 860488 ...there's a sense of foreboding<br />as well.
864829 868492 And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />goes to work with his jab as though...
868666 872534 ...he's fighting against the number one<br />challenger in the heavyweight division.
872971 874871 See, this is to be expected early on.
875039 877735 You knew the champ would<br />control the distance with his jab...
877909 879934 ...his height, his range.
881312 884406 Balboa looking to get in a shot,<br />misses wildly.
884582 886413 Did you like that?
886884 890012 It looks like a speed bag<br />against a punching bag.
890221 891813 Rocky's understandably frustrated...
891990 894322 ...but he came out of retirement<br />to get into a fight.
894492 897052 Guys named Rocky<br />don't like to be toyed with.
897228 898923 One punch could still turn it around.
899130 902224 Apparently he forgot<br />his arthritis meds this morning.
902533 904000 Rocky misses.
904369 908100 There's a meat-seeking missile<br />on the point of the chin by the champ.
908272 911002 - More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.<br />- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
911175 914508 And there's a hard right hand<br />and a left and a right by Balboa!
914679 917648 He drives Dixon into the ropes<br />with a series of shots!
917815 920249 And the crowd goes berserk!
925089 929355 Dixon punishing Balboa for<br />the temerity of landing those shots.
932864 937460 It's toe to toe in the corner.<br />Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
944208 947075 Balboa landing potent combinations<br />to the head of the champion.
947412 948640 A wake-up call for Dixon.
948813 950440 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm all right.
950615 953812 - The mars got bricks in his gloves.<br />- Where's the stuff in the basement?
953985 956180 - It's still there.<br />- He came to battle, okay?
956354 957821 - Trying to knock me out.<br />- Listen.
957989 960423 If there's a bone he can break,<br />he's gonna do it.
960591 962889 - Give the man respect.<br />- What about my respect?
963061 965894 CompuBox numbers<br />tell the grisly story here.
966064 969124 Balboa landed nine of 13<br />punches in that round.
969300 974465 Dixon landed an incredible<br />59 out of 69.
974639 978097 - Why don't you listen to me?<br />- Rocky's been here a million times.
978276 981473 Coming out to start a round after<br />he took a beating in the previous one.
981646 984809 - Remember what I said, okay?<br />- I warned him. I warned him.
985883 990820 He's tired. His legs are going fast,<br />or already gone.
990988 995550 And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it.
995727 1000664 The boxing commission, which<br />was criticized for licensing him...
1000832 1005064 ...would be massacred<br />if something happened to Rocky.
1008372 1011034 And a monstrous straight left hand!<br />Down goes Rocky!
1011242 1013540 And that could conceivably<br />be the end of the fight!
1013711 1017545 That could be the exhibition<br />right there. But no. Balboa up.
1017715 1022015 Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue, and Rocky says yes.
1022186 1025053 Even Rocky Balboa could be<br />too brave for his own good.
1025223 1028818 Dixon comes right back to try to<br />finish it. Balboa almost went down!
1028993 1030984 Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
1031162 1033687 As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
1033865 1036425 - Cover up! Cover up!<br />- Open shots at close range.
1036601 1039126 Right and left hands,<br />and down goes Balboa!
1039303 1042670 Perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career!
1042840 1045240 - That should do it.<br />- Three! Four!
1045409 1047741 Five! Six!
1047912 1049539 Get up! Get up!<br />- Seven!
1049714 1051511 Eight! Nine!
1052950 1056147 - How do you feel, man? You okay?<br />- Now Rocky is furious with himself.
1056320 1058914 He convinces Cortez<br />he wants to keep fighting.
1059090 1060955 Dixors pointing at the ref to end it.
1061125 1063218 Rocky waving his arms<br />and saying he's fine.
1063394 1065555 - He wants to go on!<br />- Let it go! Let it go!
1066497 1069557 And Balboa comes back!<br />With a left and a right...
1069734 1073636 ...and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row!
1074839 1077399 Back comes Dixon<br />with brutal left-hand shots.
1077575 1079770 - Dixon hurt his hand there!<br />- Go after him!
1079944 1081605 This is Rocky's best chance!
1081779 1084009 The champ obviously hurt<br />his hand on Rocky's hip!
1084182 1088016 And Balboa immediately going to<br />work to the body! Huge right hook!
1088186 1091747 Balboa ripping away at Dixors body!<br />These are big punches.
1091989 1095720 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1097128 1098186 Yes!
1100631 1105091 Rocky Balboa has knocked the<br />reigning heavyweight champion down!
1105269 1107169 - You hurt him!<br />- Mason "The Line" Dixon...
1107338 1109397 ...has never taken<br />this kind of punishment...
1109574 1111735 ...in his entire professional career!
1111909 1115902 Maybe he's clearing his head, but<br />the body shots really caved in his ribs.
1116080 1118742 Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
1118916 1122443 Another counterhook by Balboa,<br />followed by two more!
1122620 1125111 Dixon fires back his own hooks!<br />Now Rocky's stunned.
1125289 1127814 It's an all-out war along the ropes...
1127992 1133020 ...as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring!
1133731 1135323 Incredible.
1135499 1137160 All right!
1137335 1139132 Welcome to Rockyland.
1143241 1145675 - How's the hand?<br />- My hand's broken.
1147778 1149803 We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
1149981 1152279 It will numb up on you<br />in a few rounds.
1152450 1156045 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
1156220 1158620 Until then, here is Rocky's chance.
1158789 1161519 - No reverse!<br />- Take the pain, champ.
1161692 1164490 Stay on him! Everybody thought<br />this was a joke, including me!
1164662 1167290 Now nobody's laughing!<br />Stay on him! You go get him!
1168065 1169965 Go out strong!
1181779 1182768 Keep him off you!
1186651 1187640 That's it! That's it!
1202099 1204158 You won that round.<br />Break him down.
1209840 1211831 Bomb him! Bomb him!
1217548 1218742 Yeah!
1222687 1224985 Just keep throwing them bombs!
1236767 1237927 Come on.
1245476 1247535 You can do this.
1248412 1251176 Rocko. Rocko.
1259790 1262156 Yeah, come on, go!
1319216 1321081 Go through him! Run over him!
1336534 1337762 Unload on him!
1339637 1340626 Get down, Mason!
1352450 1354441 They're leaving nothing<br />on the table, guys.
1354652 1359146 The fans are still standing. They may<br />not be able to sit down for a week.
1359323 1362087 - You're doing great!<br />- I'm doing better than I thought.
1362259 1366059 - You sure he's okay?<br />- I've had worse.
1366230 1369961 Toe to toe, one round to go. Who<br />would've believed this was possible?
1370134 1372500 - Can you see out of that eye?<br />- Let me talk to him.
1372903 1374928 Don't take any more chances<br />than you have to.
1375106 1378075 There's nothing more to prove, Pop.<br />There's nothing more to prove.
1378242 1380369 I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
1380544 1382102 You can do it, Rocko!
1382313 1384611 - One more round, we go home.<br />- Okay, then do it.
1384782 1388309 There's an old saying that<br />every great champion has...
1388486 1393788 ...one great fight left in him,<br />and Rocky is proving it so far.
1393958 1397155 - Come on. Touch them up.<br />- Rocko! The last round of your life!
1397328 1398989 - Come on, guys.<br />- The last round!
1399163 1401529 Come on. Touch them up, let's go.<br />Touch them up.
1402199 1405100 - You are one crazy old man.<br />- You'll get there.
1405569 1406729 Let's go.
1407037 1410268 Tenth round of a scheduled 10.<br />Who would ever have dreamed...
1410441 1415242 ...that Rocky Balboa would still be<br />in this quote, "exhibition," against...
1415412 1418176 ...the heavyweight champion?<br />- You can do it! Come on!
1418349 1422683 This fight is as though Dixon<br />got on-the-job training in courage.
1423787 1426551 - Cover up! Cover up!<br />- They're both in a pain-free zone!
1426724 1429955 These guys are fighting<br />in another dimension right now!
1430127 1434188 Beyond belief! Balboa just walking<br />straight into Dixors punches.
1434365 1436959 Target practice for Dixon.
1440404 1442872 They're exchanging right hooks!<br />Balboa's drilled!
1443040 1446271 Here comes Dixon! He's exhausted<br />from just punching the man!
1448145 1449476 Knock this bum out, Mase!
1462026 1466053 What is it you said to the kid?<br />It ain't about how hard you hit.
1466230 1470257 It' about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep moving forward.
1470568 1474265 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
1474438 1476235 - Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!<br />- Get up.
1476407 1478398 - Let's go! Get up!<br />- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1478609 1481305 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
1481545 1483445 Get up.
1504501 1508096 Another monster body shot. Rocky's<br />ancestors must have felt that one.
1508272 1510331 Come on, Rocky!<br />Start moving those hands!
1510574 1512269 Less than two minutes to go.
1512443 1514809 The crowd is astonished<br />that Balboa got up.
1514979 1517470 - Come on!<br />- Turn it over! All the way through!
1517915 1519610 And retaliates with fury!
1523153 1524347 Chop him down!
1528025 1529686 Come on, Rocky! Come on!
1532129 1533687 Take him out now!
1534832 1536891 They're trading shots again!
1537067 1540662 Balboa is trying to hit<br />anything and anywhere!
1543007 1544338 Win it! Win it!
1553484 1554084 Yes!
1554084 1554982 Yes!
1563761 1566594 You're a great champion.<br />You got heart.
1566764 1568527 Thanks for the opportunity.<br />Good man.
1571568 1574662 That was unbelievable. That was<br />the greatest thing I've ever seen.
1576807 1579537 You did it. That's the kind<br />of fighting you're talking about.
1581111 1583079 Hey, Paulie.
1583280 1586113 That beast is gone now.<br />The beast is out.
1586283 1590083 One of the most overused words<br />in sports, guys, is "incredible."
1590254 1594554 I hate to say it. This is incredible.
1595926 1597587 Let's go!
1600331 1603994 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />before we go to the scorecards...
1604168 1610266 ...a round of applause for these<br />two heavyweight warriors!

1719583 1722552 You know, I couldn't have<br />done nothing without you.
1725022 1727582 Yo, Adrian, we did it.
1734364 1736127 We did it.
