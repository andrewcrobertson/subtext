1356438 1357938 Yeah.<br />Yeah, like down the street
1358106 1359732 is the Cambria Fight Club.
1359900 1361776 They used to call that place,<br />like, the Bucket of Blood.
1361943 1363402 I took some massive<br />beatings down there.
1363570 1365196 But it was nice.<br />Good memories.

1370619 1375664 If I was 1 50 years old,<br />I'd be falling apart too.<br />So it's okay, building.

2339253 2341838 I tried calling,<br />but nothing was picking up.
2342006 2344257 Is something wrong?<br />No, I just wanted to come by
2344425 2346426 and see you in person.<br />You wanna come inside?

2598887 2602515 MAN: <i>This plenary session of the<br />Pennsylvania Athletic Commission</i>
2602683 2608271 is convened in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa
2608439 2612692 for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing license
2612860 2617655 due to his ineligibility to be<br />licensed as a matter of right.
2617823 2621784 Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself,
2621952 2625079 we invite you to make an opening<br />statement, if you'd like to.
2625247 2627832 No, I was just curious<br />how I did, that's all.
2628000 2632545 All right, well, the Medical<br />Advisory Board has informed us
2632713 2635632 that the battery of tests<br />to which you've been subjected,
2635799 2639052 you've passed these tests<br />with flying colors.
2639303 2641846 And we congratulate<br />you for that.
2642014 2644891 Thanks.<br />However, this commission,
2645059 2648853 in good conscience, cannot<br />recommend you for a license
2649229 2652440 and we therefore deny<br />your application.
2653776 2656569 Didn't I do what you asked?<br />Yes, you did.
2656737 2658446 So I should get<br />a license, right?
2658781 2659989 Not exactly.
2662993 2666537 So why did you give me<br />all them tests if you was<br />never passing me?
2666705 2672210 We've gotta stand by our decision<br />here, and we have to deny your<br />request for a license at this time.
2672378 2674379 [♪♪♪]
2684473 2687100 Yo, don't I got some rights?
2687267 2689352 COMMISSIONER:<br />What rights do you think<br />you're referring to?
2689520 2692188 Like in that official paper<br />they wrote down the street?
2692356 2694273 That's the Bill of Rights.<br />Yeah, yeah. The Bill of Rights.
2694441 2696693 Don't it say something about going<br />after what makes you happy?
2696860 2699612 No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."<br />But what's your point?
2699780 2703074 My point is I'm pursuing something,<br />and nobody looks too happy about it.
2703367 2705743 But we're just looking out<br />for your interests.
2705911 2709580 I appreciate that, but maybe you're<br />looking out for your interests more.
2709748 2713084 You shouldn't ask people<br />to come here and pay<br />the freight on something.
2713252 2716421 They pay, it still ain't good enough.<br />You think that's right?
2716588 2719841 Maybe you're doing your job,<br />but why you gotta stop me<br />from doing mine?
2720384 2724262 If you're willing to go through<br />all the battling to get where<br />you want to get,
2724430 2726139 who's got the right to stop you?
2726306 2729767 Maybe you got something you never<br />finished, something you wanna do.
2729935 2732145 Something you never said<br />to somebody, something!
2732312 2734480 And you're told no,<br />even after you pay your dues.
2734648 2737233 Who's got the right<br />to tell you that? Who? Nobody!
2737401 2740570 It's your right to listen to your gut.<br />It's nobody's right to say no
2740738 2744157 after you earn the right to<br />be what you wanna be or<br />do what you wanna do!

2748370 2752498 The older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.

2774646 2776439 Yo! Have you seen<br />the paper today?
2776607 2778733 Front row. Front row.

2784031 2787867 Let's get a beer. Come on.<br />Come on.
2788327 2790369 The last two pay-per-views<br />were in the toilet.
2790537 2793164 You're not making<br />heavyweight-championship money.
2793332 2795291 There's a bunch of nobodies<br />out there, Mase.
2795459 2798503 I wanna talk to you about an<br />opportunity we should run with.
2798670 2802507 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a license and got one?
2802674 2804550 I heard. Forget about him.<br />Hear me out. Hear me out.
2804718 2808095 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands tied behind my back.
2808263 2811641 Everybody knows you<br />could beat him sitting down.<br />That's not what it's about.
2811809 2815061 It's about making money. We gotta<br />capitalize on that computer fight.
2815229 2817980 This could do a million buys.<br />That's 1 5, 20 million to you.
2818148 2820149 Forget about it.<br />No one's beating the door down
2820317 2822985 to watch you fight anymore.<br />We got guaranteed fights.
2823153 2826113 You wanna do this now in front<br />of your friends, we'll do it now.
2826281 2829742 We got nothing. All the pay-per-view<br />fights you come up with got rejected.
2829910 2833454 You know why? They're all bums<br />out there. Nobody cares about them.
2833872 2837583 There's no marquee value.<br />But this Balboa thing is interesting.
2837918 2839460 I don't wanna do it.<br />Listen to me.
2839628 2841420 It's a has-been,<br />never-gonna-be world.
2841588 2843548 Call it nostalgia,<br />whatever you want,
2843715 2846926 but people relate to that stuff.<br />This is a no-lose. It's all good.
2847386 2849971 Good for who?<br />For you! Not for me! For you!
2850305 2853266 Maybe you don't understand.<br />People don't like you no more.
2853433 2856894 They don't follow you.<br />They're not supporting you<br />anymore. Understand?
2857062 2859188 Don't look at me like<br />I'm messing with your legacy.
2859356 2861107 Every jock now thinks<br />they got a legacy.
2861275 2864193 A legacy is what you get instead<br />of getting paid. That's a legacy.
2864361 2866946 Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />I'm not. I'm not no more.
2867114 2870658 LOU:<br />Everybody knows you could kick<br />this old man's ass. But you don't.
2870826 2872869 You leave him with a little<br />bit of dignity, so they say:
2873036 2876539 "Mason Dixon's got compassion.<br />He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."
2876707 2879125 You get a whole new audience,<br />we'll double your money.
2879293 2881335 You want a new image?<br />That's how you get it.
2881503 2883254 To replace the one<br />that you two made?
2883422 2886257 Whoa, wait. We made your<br />world green. You made the rest.
2886425 2888384 All this is you.<br />You made all this junk happen.
2888552 2890261 I've had it up to here<br />with this mess.
2890429 2892930 Time for me to make changes.<br />I'm going to Martin's gym.
2893098 2894807 We'll talk about it.<br />Forget this crap.
2894975 2897351 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.

2909990 2912408 I was driving around<br />the neighborhood, I thought,
2912576 2915202 why not drive by and say hello?<br />You wanna come inside?
2915370 2918414 No, the dog needs some exercise.<br />You wanna take a little walk?
2918582 2921000 Yeah, yeah. All right.<br />It's nice outside.
2921168 2923711 All right.<br />Nice and brisk.
2923879 2925087 When did you<br />get a dog?
2925255 2927340 We picked up Punchy<br />a couple of days back.
2927507 2928716 Punchy?<br />Yeah.
2928884 2930134 You named your<br />dog Punchy?
2930302 2932011 Your kid come up<br />with the name.
2932179 2934597 Oh, yeah? I think<br />that's disrespectful.
2934765 2936515 Oh, no, no.<br />It's fine, really.
2936683 2940019 No, it's easy to remember<br />and it's all that, you know.
2940187 2943189 Listen, what do you think about<br />coming over to the restaurant?
2943357 2946359 What for?<br />Well, you know, for, like...
2946526 2949987 For work. The hostess is gonna<br />be having a kid. You'd do good.
2950155 2952698 I don't know.<br />I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
2952866 2955326 I appreciate what you're doing<br />for my kid, but I can't.
2955494 2957954 Hey, listen, I think<br />you'd like it a lot.
2958121 2960539 It's a nice environment,<br />it's very pleasant.
2960707 2962792 Yeah, can we drop it?
2965253 2966754 What's bothering you?
2966922 2969173 Nothing. It's all right.<br />Listen, I gotta get back.
2970592 2972551 No, it ain't all right.<br />Oh, come on.
2972886 2974720 What?<br />I'm gonna be the first person
2974888 2977348 people see when they walk in?<br />You give out menus.
2977516 2980267 You say, "Hello, how are you?"<br />You sit people down.
2980435 2982728 Look, if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.

2986316 2988150 Give it a try, like two weeks.
2988318 2990111 I don't wanna try.

3002082 3006585 Yo, when was the last time you<br />went dancing? Has it been a while?
3006753 3008629 Why are you asking?<br />I'm asking because
3008797 3012091 you dance around these problems,<br />you might as well dance with me.
3012259 3015261 I ain't that good, but I'm<br />better than the average bear.
3015429 3018097 Where that came from,<br />I don't know.
3018765 3020224 You're crazy.<br />Yeah, a little bit.
3020392 3023644 But the way you're thinking<br />and talking, it's a little crazy too.
3024521 3028149 Come on, you deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
3028316 3032570 I need you to class my<br />place up. Philly needs you.
3032946 3036615 And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"<br />again, I totally understand.
3036783 3039201 But I'm warning you,<br />I'm gonna put myself,
3039369 3041245 like, geographically in the<br />middle of the street here
3041413 3044331 and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />and wave to the first bus, say:
3044499 3046250 "Come on over here<br />and mash me!
3046418 3048878 Little Marie turned down<br />the job at the restaurant.
3049046 3050755 She thinks she's better than us."
3050922 3054175 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
3054801 3056802 Yeah?<br />No.
3058055 3060514 Phew! That was a close call.
3061600 3066604 Listen, seriously.<br />Come on over. It'd be nice.

3192105 3194064 I don't need a watch.
3195901 3199278 I got a watch!<br />You gave me a watch!

3230977 3235397 It takes guts climbing back<br />in that ring, knowing you're<br />gonna take a beating.
3238109 3239985 You're gonna do<br />all right, Rocko.
3240278 3241612 How do you know that?

3274813 3277606 Okay. You got it.<br />Okay?
3281027 3282611 Thanks for coming by.<br />I appreciate it.
3282779 3283779 Our pleasure.
3283947 3285906 Wanna hear some stories?<br />LOU: What kind of stories?
3286116 3288826 Well, a lot of people like to<br />hear these old fight stories.
3288994 3290452 LOU: Maybe later.<br />Okay.
3290620 3295082 I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixon's manager.
3295292 3297710 Will you sit down and join us?<br />Sure.
3299254 3302047 You know, we have the promotional<br />contract for Mason Dixon,
3302215 3303757 who's a big fan, by the way.<br />Really?
3303925 3306051 When he heard you were<br />interested in fighting again,
3306219 3308470 he thought why not try<br />to work something out?
3308638 3311682 Like a special event.<br />Like a first-class exhibition fight.
3313226 3315311 Why me?<br />He respects the hell out of you.
3315478 3319440 All right? And let's be honest,<br />that computer fight got people<br />curious.
3319607 3320816 This could be<br />very interesting.
3320984 3324361 Yeah, but I ain't interested<br />in getting, like, mangled<br />and embarrassed.
3324529 3326697 No, that's not gonna happen.<br />Never happen. No.
3326865 3331035 Truthfully, I was thinking<br />more on a, like,
3331411 3335039 minuscule, small level. You know.<br />Small fights, not big fights.
3335290 3339251 Small fights. Things that--<br />Local. You know what I mean?
3339419 3342921 Not a bad idea. Don't think<br />of it as big. Think of it like<br />an exhibition.
3343089 3346675 Think of it as a glorified sparring<br />session. Here's something you'll like.
3346843 3349386 We're gonna donate a portion<br />of the gate to charity.
3349554 3350763 Well, that's always nice.
3350930 3353265 It's good to give.<br />Yeah.
3353725 3355309 Where's it taking place?
3355477 3356852 Las Vegas.<br />Las Vegas.
3357020 3360272 Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killing you.
3360440 3362816 Little stiff.<br />You move better when you're warmer.
3363443 3365069 Yeah.<br />And if nothing else,
3365236 3367321 you'll have new stories to tell.
3367614 3370449 I really gotta think about this.<br />LOU: Absolutely.
3370617 3371617 Is that okay?
3371785 3372993 I understand. No problem.<br />No problem.
3373370 3375579 I'm gonna go over there.<br />You can order something.
3375747 3377831 What do you recommend?<br />It's all edible.
3378041 3380125 [LAUGHING]
3380752 3383337 Okay. Thanks.
3383963 3387800 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime?
3387967 3390427 He'd kill him. Kill him.<br />You ain't kidding.
3390970 3393305 Man, I'm confused.
3400522 3402439 ROCKY: I didn't think this<br />was gonna come along.
3402607 3404233 MARIE:<br />But this is what you wanted, right?
3404401 3406693 I don't know.<br />You know, I talk and I talk.
3406861 3408987 Sometimes I think<br />what I'm saying is true,
3409155 3413492 and then I look at myself and I'm<br />not even sure what is true anymore.
3413660 3416662 Because it's like, I pushed<br />this crazy idea about fighting.
3416830 3418372 I mean, what's it all about?
3418540 3421500 Do I really care about standing<br />toe to toe and all that stuff,
3421668 3425254 or, like my kid says,<br />is it just, like, ego?
3425422 3429174 Or am I this old pug<br />who's just trying to replace<br />old pain with new pain?
3429342 3431969 I don't know. I don't know.
3433721 3436515 Look, I know<br />I usually don't say a lot.
3436683 3440727 I'm always listening and looking.
3440895 3445858 But who you are, the part<br />of you that's so full of life,
3446025 3448068 we all have that feeling,<br />that fire,
3448236 3452739 but usually never get a chance<br />to use it. And then it just goes away.
3452907 3457870 But you can. You've got this<br />opportunity, so do it. Why not?
3458037 3462332 I mean, this is who you are.<br />This is who you'll always be.
3462500 3465794 And you don't move<br />aside for nobody until<br />you're ready to move.
3465962 3468755 And it doesn't matter<br />how this looks to other people.
3468923 3471216 All that matters<br />is how it looks to you.

3528525 3532486 LOU:<br />It's rare when you get to promote<br />an event bigger than boxing. This is.

3540954 3544206 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
3544374 3545582 REPORTER 1:<br />Hey, champ!
3545750 3549753 REPORTER 2: A few great<br />fighters have fought in their 50s,<br />often with disastrous results.
3549921 3551588 Why risk the danger<br />and embarrassment?
3551756 3554174 The smart money says<br />you have virtually no chance.
3554342 3558428 A puncher always has a chance.<br />This fight will be competitive.

3562016 3566186 <i>l don't know, l'd rather do<br />something l love badly than--</i>
3566354 3570983 PAULIE:<br /><i>Than to feel bad by not<br />doing something you love.</i>
3571734 3574403 REPORTER 4:<br />Rocky, the press has<br />labeled you a Balboasaurus.

3576281 3577948 How do you feel about that?
3578116 3582077 REPORTER 5: Let's say<br />the following happens: You win,<br />we'll say you beat an old guy.
3582245 3585747 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
3585915 3589334 You all know that will never happen.<br />This is only an exhibition.

3598678 3600304 Next question.<br />REPORTER 7: On the surface,
3600471 3603557 this looks like a cheap bit of<br />ring theater between, no offense,
3603725 3607936 a has-been and a man<br />whose own credible legacy<br />and popularity is in doubt.
3608104 3609730 What's the upside?<br />Doubt?
3609897 3612441 Upside? I mean...
3612609 3616278 What do you mean, upside?<br />I mean, what do I have to do?
3617530 3619781 You know, I'm 33-0<br />with 30 knockouts.
3620033 3622993 I'm doing you people a favor.<br />I'm having this exhibition for you.
3623161 3626163 You gonna get up here<br />and make a mockery<br />out of me? I'm the champ.

3680510 3683762 Hey, Rock. I made<br />some connections.
3683930 3686264 I can make some money<br />on this, endorsements.
3687433 3688642 Absolutely. Do that.
3689060 3691478 Thank you, Rock. Okay.<br />Sure.
3692188 3695607 So you nervous about the fight?<br />Scared to death.
3695775 3698485 You don't look scared.<br />Well, I ain't supposed to.
3698653 3701071 Then you don't<br />have to do it.

3717880 3720632 Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.<br />What, my last name?
3720800 3722718 That's the reason<br />I got a decent job.
3722885 3725095 That's why people deal with me<br />in the first place.
3725263 3726930 Now I start to get a little ahead,
3727098 3731017 I start to get a little something<br />for myself, and this happens.
3731185 3734479 Now, I'm asking you as a favor<br />not to go through with this.
3734647 3737816 This is gonna end up bad for you,<br />and it's gonna end up bad for me.
3737984 3740694 You think I'm hurting you?<br />Yeah. In a way, you are.
3741028 3742904 That's the last thing<br />I ever wanted to do.
3743072 3746491 I know that's not what you wanna do,<br />but that's just the way that it is.
3746659 3749786 Don't you care what people think?<br />Doesn't it bother you that people
3749954 3752998 are making you out to be a joke<br />and that I'll be included in that?
3753166 3756209 Do you think that's right?<br />Do you?
3762216 3767179 You ain't gonna believe this,<br />but you used to fit right here.
3767346 3769556 I'd hold you up<br />and say to your mother:
3769724 3772309 "This kid is gonna be<br />the best kid in the world.
3772477 3775687 This kid is gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew."
3775855 3778690 And you grew up<br />good and wonderful.
3778858 3782027 It was great just watching,<br />every day was like a privilege.
3782195 3785363 Then the time come for you to be<br />your own man and take on the world
3785531 3790076 and you did. But somewhere<br />along the line, you changed.
3790244 3791536 You stopped being you.
3791704 3794998 You let people stick a finger in your<br />face and tell you you're no good.
3795166 3798835 And when things got hard,<br />you started looking for<br />something to blame,
3799003 3801087 like a big shadow.
3802548 3804841 Let me tell you something<br />you already know.
3805009 3807344 The world ain't all<br />sunshine and rainbows.
3807512 3811348 It's a very mean and nasty place,<br />and I don't care how tough you are,
3811516 3815101 it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there if you let it.
3815728 3819731 You, me or nobody<br />is gonna hit as hard as life.
3819899 3824069 But it ain't about how hard you hit.<br />It's about how hard you can get hit
3824237 3825612 and keep moving forward.
3825780 3828990 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
3829158 3831576 That's how winning is done!
3832036 3834746 If you know what you're worth,<br />go and get what you're worth.
3834914 3838208 But you gotta be willing to take<br />the hits, and not pointing fingers
3838376 3842462 saying you ain't where you wanna be<br />because of him or her or anybody!
3842630 3846883 Cowards do that, and that ain't you!<br />You're better than that!

3853599 3856935 I'm always gonna love you<br />no matter what.

3862316 3865110 You're the best thing in my life.
3866320 3870198 But until you start believing in<br />yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.

3937683 3939184 I quit.
3939977 3941269 Quit, why?
3942688 3945023 I wasn't very...
3945691 3948818 I don't know, I just...<br />I didn't fit in there.
3950863 3952280 I understand.
3956953 3960205 So, what are you gonna do?<br />Right now?
3961707 3964334 Right now I'd rather<br />be with you.
3966671 3968463 Is that all right?
3969799 3971591 Yeah.
3971926 3974761 It's been a long time<br />since I seen a fight.
3986607 3988858 DUKE: You know all there is<br />to know about fighting,

3992363 3996491 To beat this guy, you need<br />speed. You don't have it.

4002081 4005834 And you got arthritis in your neck.<br />And you've got calcium deposits
4006002 4009295 on most of your joints,<br />so sparring is out.
4010256 4011715 I had that problem.

5022600 5027563 LAMPLEY:<br />He's tired. His legs are<br />going fast, or already gone.
5027731 5032276 KELLERMAN:<br />And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it.
5032444 5037406 MERCHANT:<br />The boxing commission, which<br />was criticized for licensing him,
5037574 5041785 would be massacred<br />if something happened to Rocky.
5042328 5043328 [GRUNTS]
5045123 5047791 LAMPLEY:<br />And a monstrous straight left hand!<br />Down goes Rocky!
5047959 5050294 And that could conceivably<br />be the end of the fight!
5050462 5054298 That could be the exhibition<br />right there. But no. Balboa up.
5054466 5058761 Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue, and Rocky says yes.
5058928 5061805 KELLERMAN:<br />Even Rocky Balboa could be<br />too brave for his own good.
5061973 5065559 LAMPLEY:<br />Dixon comes right back to try to<br />finish it. Balboa almost went down!
5065727 5067728 MERCHANT:<br />Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
5067896 5070439 LAMPLEY:<br />As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
5070607 5071815 Cover up! Cover up!
5071983 5073150 LAMPLEY:<br />Open shots at close range.
5073318 5075861 Right and left hands,<br />and down goes Balboa!
5076029 5079406 Perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career!
5079574 5081992 MERCHANT: That should do it.<br />CORTEZ: Three! Four!
5082160 5084495 Five! Six!
5084662 5086288 Get up! Get up!<br />CORTEZ: Seven!
5086456 5088248 Eight! Nine!
5089667 5090959 How do you feel, man?<br />You okay?
5091127 5092878 LAMPLEY:<br />Now Rocky is furious with himself.
5093046 5095672 He convinces Cortez<br />he wants to keep fighting.
5095840 5097674 KELLERMAN:<br />Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.
5097842 5099968 Rocky waving his arms<br />and saying he's fine.
5100136 5102304 He wants to go on!<br />Let it go! Let it go!
5103223 5106308 LAMPLEY:<br />And Balboa comes back!<br />With a left and a right
5106476 5110354 and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row!
5111564 5112940 Back comes Dixon<br />with brutal left-hand shots.
5113108 5114149 [♪♪♪]
5114317 5116527 Dixon hurt his hand there!<br />Go after him!
5116694 5118362 KELLERMAN:<br />This is Rocky's best chance!
5118530 5120739 The champ obviously hurt<br />his hand on Rocky's hip!
5120907 5124743 LAMPLEY:<br />And Balboa immediately going to<br />work to the body! Huge right hook!
5124911 5128497 Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body!<br />These are big punches.
5128706 5132459 CROWD [CHANTING]:<br /><i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

5144055 5146140 has never taken<br />this kind of punishment
5146307 5148475 in his entire professional career!
5148643 5152646 KELLERMAN: Maybe<br />he's clearing his head, but the<br />body shots really caved in his ribs.
5152814 5155482 LAMPLEY:<br />Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
5155650 5159194 KELLERMAN:<br />Another counterhook by Balboa,<br />followed by two more!
5159362 5161864 LAMPLEY:<br />Dixon fires back his own hooks!<br />Now Rocky's stunned.
5162031 5164575 It's an all-out war along the ropes
5164742 5167619 as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring!

5184512 5186555 We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
5186723 5189016 It will numb up on you<br />in a few rounds.
5189184 5192769 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
5192937 5195355 Until then, here is Rocky's chance.
5195523 5198275 No reverse!<br />Take the pain, champ.
