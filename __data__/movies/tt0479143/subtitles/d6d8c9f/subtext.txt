107816 111360 Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,<br />almost perfunctory.
111487 113488 The fans let him know how they feel.
113530 116741 Hide the women and children.<br />This could get ugly.
116825 121329 This crowd does nothing to hide<br />its anger over this latest debacle.
121413 124207 The fans are mad.<br />They don't want to take it any more.
124333 126793 They seem to be blaming Dixon,<br />a good fighter,
126877 131714 for the decline not only of the heavyweight<br />division guys, but of the entire sport.
131757 137220 They're actually pelting the undefeated<br />heavyweight champion with ice.
137304 140556 Maybe this angry reaction<br />will pressure Dixon
140641 144227 to fight someone who can fight back -<br />if there's somebody out there.
144353 150358 All of boxing is hoping for a warrior<br />who thrills us with his passion.
297506 299757 Time goes by too fast.
299841 304470 Yeah? Not fast enough.<br />Your kid should've been here.
304554 306722 - That's all right.<br />- No, it ain't.
306765 310935 - The kid gets a little busy sometimes.<br />- He don't get that busy.
311061 315481 Well, let's not talk about it here, OK?<br />You're coming tonight, right?
315565 319276 I'm working.<br />I took the tour the last three years.
319403 323406 - I know, but it's the anniversary.<br />- Fine. You got my word.
323448 325741 I appreciate it. Thank you.
325867 328035 I owe you, Paulie.
359359 364363 Robert, what's going on?<br />Where've you been? You're late.
364448 366282 I don't want to hear it.
366324 370327 Your job performance is nowhere near<br />good enough to be pulling this.
370454 373622 I don't give a damn who your father is.<br />You understand me?
373749 376083 All right. Now get outta here.
376126 378127 Thank you, sir.
380297 382131 Yo, Robert.
382174 384467 Yo.
384551 387636 - Hey, how you doin'?<br />- What's up, champ?
387763 391640 - You caught me off guard.<br />- I wanted to catch you before you got busy.
391683 394518 - Yeah, it gets busy up there.<br />- So how you doin'?
394644 396187 - Real good.<br />- Yeah?
396313 399648 - Yo, Rock!<br />- Yeah, how you doin'?
399775 404153 - Yeah, real good.<br />- You wanna go out and get some coffee?
404279 408199 - I'm kinda behind. Maybe later?<br />- Yeah, that'd be great.
408325 412203 Come by the restaurant tonight.<br />I can have something made special for you.
412329 416791 Tonight I can't. I got plans.<br />A few of the guys get together, you know?
416833 419502 - Did I do something wrong?<br />- What do you mean?
419586 422671 Well... I don't know exactly what I mean,
422756 426842 but I just think that when I come here<br />you don't feel so comfortable
426927 430262 and I certainly don't wanna do that.
430347 433599 - You... you throw a big shadow.<br />- A big shadow?
433683 436352 You won't get anything done<br />down here, Robert.
436394 439855 If you won't introduce me, then I will.<br />I'm William Tomilson.
439981 442566 - How you doin'?<br />- Your son works for me.
442692 444527 It's a good job.
444569 447655 I've told Robert about 20 times<br />that I wanted to meet you.
447697 452701 I guess you're pretty busy, which isn't a bad<br />thing, is it? Grab a shot, will you, please?
452828 456247 I may not get this chance again.<br />Old warhorses gotta stick together.
456373 458541 - The old horses, yeah.<br />- I tell you.
458667 462545 - It's a good thing it's not your left.<br />- This makes you very popular.
462587 465881 - One, two, three.<br />- Finally we get to meet.
465924 468551 I gotta go.<br />It was nice to meet you face to face.
468593 473389 - How you doin'?<br />- You take care of yourself. I'll see you later.
474724 478227 I gotta get going.<br />I'll change my plans for tonight.
478353 481188 That'd be great.<br />I'm lookin' forward to it.
481231 483232 - OK.<br />- OK.
484151 487444 And do not let those numbers<br />drive you crazy.
487571 492074 - Too late.<br />- Use an eraser and get rid of all of 'em.
494661 496495 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hey, Rock.
496580 498581 How you doin'?
513263 515264 Here you go.
519436 523105 It'll be about ten tenths, OK?<br />You guys take care, OK? You got it.
526276 528444 I'll try a few of these later on.
529279 531864 - It's good for bakin'.<br />- How much?
531948 533908 - Paul, what's the cost?<br />- 58.40, sir.
533950 536535 Right. Take it out of that. I trust you.
539122 541332 - You're generous.<br />- Not a problem.
558475 560643 How you guys doin'?
567400 569485 How we doin', Isabel?
569569 572154 OK, except for the freebie readin' the Bible.
572197 573364 He's OK.
573490 576033 Just cos you fought him<br />don't mean you gotta feed him.
576159 579536 - He doesn't even look like a fighter.<br />- Spider Rico could hit.
579663 582373 - Listen, how's your stomach?<br />- It's OK.
582499 586877 If you keep rubbing that olive oil on your<br />stomach, your kid will be born very strong.
587003 590547 - OK, whatever you say.<br />- No, really.
592717 595511 - Yo, how you doin', Spider?<br />- God bless you, Rocky.
595595 596845 Thanks.
602143 604812 - How you guys doin'?<br />- Hi, Rocky.
606022 609942 Jose, can you make something special<br />for my kid who's comin' tonight?
610026 612528 - No problemo.<br />- Good.
612654 614655 I appreciate it.
616241 619326 Back and forth, back and forth.<br />Give and take.
619369 622663 Then I went in there like an animal<br />and threw him into the corner
622747 626542 and I unloaded everything I had -<br />hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
626626 631463 But Creed, he kept busting me back<br />pretty good and the agony began to pile up.
631548 634967 Then I heard the best sound<br />I ever heard in my life...
635051 636844 - The bell.<br />- Right, the bell.
636886 640055 And I ain't ever been so tired<br />and I'm sittin' in my corner
640140 644852 and I'm trying to figure out how to survive<br />the last round when Mickey says:
644894 648147 "Come on. Get out there<br />and fight this guy hard, you bum. "
648231 650566 "You gotta be first. You gotta be first. "
650692 654194 - I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could... "<br />- "I would. "
654279 657156 "I would. " The end.
657240 659241 - Salud.<br />- Salud.
683933 687394 Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,<br />almost perfunctory.
687437 690230 The fans let him know how they feel.
690273 696445 They're actually pelting the undefeated<br />heavyweight champion with ice.
701785 703619 Hello, Adrian's.
703745 705537 Yeah?
705622 707831 Tell him you can't make it?
707916 710542 Yeah, I'll give him the message.
710627 715547 I just kept hearing, you know, Mickey's<br />voice in my head over and over again.
715632 721011 I just dug down and before you know it,<br />it was toe-to-toe and it was... Excuse me.
721096 726517 Your son said he can't make it.<br />He said he'll take a rain check. OK?
738947 743033 Look at these birds.<br />Don't these birds look like flying candy?
743159 745035 Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?
745161 748080 You need somebody to walk you home?
749707 755337 It's a cold night. We need a few laughs<br />in our life. What do you think?
755463 757506 Maybe? Maybe?
757590 759967 OK, let's get outta here. OK?
774983 777609 This place ain't changed much from last year.
777694 779736 We done?
779821 781947 Hey, how you doin', Mick?
784909 790330 - That sign's fallin' apart, Paulie.<br />- The whole world's fallin' apart. Look at us.
790373 793000 Don't talk crazy, Paulie.
793042 799006 You know, I think if you live someplace<br />long enough, you are that place.
799048 801592 I ain't no talkin' building.
801718 804261 Come on, it's gettin' late.
804387 807139 I get a headache from this train.
826868 829912 I remember when she was standin' there
829996 834208 all nervous and shy with this little smile,
834292 837544 and all I wanted her to do was trust me.
840882 842925 She did.
843843 846345 - She did.<br />- You done?
861945 864821 - How long we stayin' here?<br />- Not long.
864948 868700 - I'm glad they tore this rink down.<br />- Come on.
868785 872246 You heard me.<br />I'm happy they tore it apart.
876292 880629 The first time I walked your sister<br />across this ice, we was over there.
880755 884299 She was nervous, but I weren't<br />so great on the blades either.
884425 888554 Ice is stupid.<br />People standing on ice are more stupid.
889889 893183 Then over there, when she was fallin'...
894143 897729 my hand grabbed her and I got her arm.
897814 900607 Through that coat I could feel it.
901526 903652 Electric.
903736 907322 You said the same thing last year, Rock.
907365 909992 - Did I?<br />- You better develop your brain.
910034 913161 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
913288 916039 Come on, Rock, let's go.
917750 921837 We're done. There's no place<br />to sit down around here.
921963 924381 - It's all right.<br />- It ain't all right.
924507 928010 It's depressing and freakin' cold!
928678 932681 - What's the matter with you, Paulie?<br />- You're livin' backwards, Rocko.
932765 936184 Change the channel from yesterday.<br />Yesterday wasn't so great.
936311 938854 - It was to me.<br />- Not to me!
940690 944693 You treated her good.<br />You had the good times.
944736 948322 I treated her bad.<br />I don't have to think about this.
949657 951867 She always loved you, Paulie.
956039 959416 Sorry, Rocko.<br />I can't do this no more.
1032448 1034449 - Can I help you?<br />- Nah, nah.
1034575 1040122 I used to come down this place a long time<br />ago. Just lookin' around. No big deal.
1040164 1042499 Can I get you a drink?
1043459 1046837 - All right, maybe just a short beer.<br />- OK.
1057473 1062310 Go. Yeah, go on. Get him to buy you one.<br />Get him to buy you one. Go.
1063146 1065647 He's got it.<br />He's spending money.
1065773 1069901 Listen... I don't mean<br />to cross the line or anything,
1069986 1074072 but I read about your wife's passin'<br />a few years back.
1074157 1076658 - Yeah, it was woman cancer.<br />- Yeah.
1076784 1079119 I always heard she was a nice person.
1079162 1081163 Yeah, the best.
1082665 1085500 - Do I know you?<br />- We met a long time ago.
1085585 1089337 - We did?<br />- When I was a kid you walked me home.
1089464 1092758 - I did?<br />- Told me to stop smokin' and things.
1094177 1097053 Stop smokin'?
1097180 1100724 Are you little Marie that used to hang out<br />at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
1100850 1103310 Yeah, that's right.
1103352 1105687 Yeah, now I remember.<br />I walked you home.
1105813 1109691 When you got there, you turned around<br />and said, "Screw you, creepo. "
1109734 1112194 - I didn't say that.<br />- Yeah, you did.
1112236 1115781 - You sure?<br />- Great insults last a long time.
1115865 1117365 Yo!
1117408 1120535 - Yo, is that you? Is that really you?<br />- How you doin'?
1120620 1124206 - I think he wants to drink alone.<br />- Well, then, give him his drink.
1124290 1130879 I ain't stoppin' you. What's that, your man<br />or something? No, I don't think so.
1132006 1136760 Anyway, me and my friends, we're down<br />there. You think you could buy us a round?
1136886 1138887 You got the money.<br />Just one round.
1138930 1140680 Hey...
1141849 1145060 What...? What are you doin'<br />pushin' my hand away like that?
1145144 1147938 - What's your name?<br />- Angie. Why do you wanna know?
1148064 1151566 - Angie, don't be playin' a fool for that guy.<br />- A fool?
1151651 1155237 A fool? I'm the fool?<br />You're the fool, not me.
1155279 1158573 You got it twisted. You're the fool.<br />I'm a person just like you.
1158699 1162244 You ain't no better than me.<br />You think you're a big shot now?
1162370 1165580 You ain't no better than me.<br />No better.
1166582 1169125 - Wow.<br />- Glad you dropped in?
1169252 1172838 I think the neighbourhood's changin' a little.
1172922 1175715 - What was that all about?<br />- I don't know. It's OK.
1175758 1179010 Well, if you wanna take off,<br />I'll tally everything up.
1179095 1180929 - Thanks.<br />- How you doin', Rock?
1181013 1183598 I'm good, thanks.
1185101 1189020 - You live around here?<br />- About eight blocks from here.
1189105 1191106 Eight blocks.
1192108 1194317 Would you need a lift?
1194443 1195443 All right.
1196571 1199698 - Did you ever get married?<br />- Yeah, sorta.
1199782 1201616 - Sorta?<br />- Well, he took off.
1201659 1205537 - Poof, just like that?<br />- Yeah, just like that.
1205621 1208623 - You sorta have any kids?<br />- Yeah, I got one kid.
1208666 1211251 Yeah, me too. Me too.
1211294 1213962 - Wonderful boy.<br />- Hey, tough guy!
1214046 1216756 What's the matter?<br />You can't buy a round?
1216799 1219259 Girl was bein' nice to your dumb ass.
1219343 1221761 Yeah, what you doin' with that pig?
1221846 1225056 - She ain't nothin' but a jealous bitch.<br />- Come on back!
1225141 1226933 Hey, don't listen to 'em.
1227018 1230145 Both of yous.<br />You ain't no better than me!
1230271 1233607 - Come over here!<br />- Everybody's her man.
1233649 1237944 - You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.<br />- You ain't no big shot! Look at you!
1237987 1241656 You ain't even got a car<br />to take that pig home.
1244785 1247579 You all right?
1247663 1249664 Yeah.
1251125 1255170 What are you doing?<br />Don't get out. It's all right.
1256756 1259841 No, little Marie, it ain't all right.
1264805 1266556 - Yo!<br />- What?
1266682 1270352 I'll tell you what.<br />Get inside. You get inside.
1270478 1273271 Hey! Leave him alone!
1273356 1275690 - You see that? You see that?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1275816 1278068 - What do you say?<br />- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
1278194 1280070 Good job.
1296045 1298880 That guy sends his apologies.
1298965 1300340 OK.
1317149 1318733 Martin.
1318818 1321528 Martin. Yo, Martin!
1326283 1330912 - I see you still got your key.<br />- Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?
1331038 1333790 I got a lot of time since your people let me go.
1333916 1336251 You know I had nothing to do with that.
1336377 1338044 Yeah?
1339588 1342507 - Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.<br />- Yeah?
1342591 1345427 - I mean, it's only temporary.<br />- Yeah, I can see that.
1345553 1349055 - I'm gonna look for an apartment.<br />- Apartments are nice.
1349098 1353018 - Yeah. It is what it is, you know.<br />- Yeah. It is what it is.
1353102 1356688 But this place used to be nice.<br />There's a lot of history around here.
1356772 1359899 Yeah, like down the street there<br />is the Cambria Fight Club.
1359942 1363611 They used to call that the Bucket of Blood.<br />I took some beatings there.
1363696 1370577 But it was nice. Good memories. I heard<br />these buildings are 100, 150 years old.
1370661 1375790 So, I mean, if I was 150 years old I'd be<br />falling apart too, so it's OK the buildings...
1375875 1380628 - Does that light work?<br />- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.
1382465 1385967 Hey, listen. Thanks for the ride,<br />and I'm sorry about those guys.
1386093 1390388 Oh, that's OK. Some of those guys just<br />got their brains on backwards and stuff.
1390473 1393349 - What's he doin' out so late?<br />- Is that your kid?
1393476 1396144 Yeah. I wish he wouldn't stay out so late.
1396270 1398813 - Amazing.<br />- Yeah? What's that?
1398898 1404110 Oh, last time I seen you, you was a kid,<br />and now you officially got one of your own.
1404153 1406946 It's amazing.<br />You know, he sorta resembles you.
1406989 1410492 He's got that, you know, big Irish hair.
1410534 1412827 Yeah, it's the other one.
1415289 1417624 - Yeah?<br />- His father was from Jamaica.
1417666 1420126 Jamaica? European.
1422171 1425799 - Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?<br />- No, not really.
1425841 1429511 - What's his name?<br />- Steps. Short for Stevenson.
1429637 1432388 Right. Makes sense.
1434683 1438394 Is he lookin' like he's mad at me,<br />or is it the angle I'm standin' at?
1438479 1441940 No, no, no. He's a good kid.<br />You want to meet him?
1442066 1446152 You know, it's gettin' kinda late.<br />I got so many things to do. It's...
1446195 1452325 Yeah, I understand. Thanks again<br />for the ride and everything else.
1454036 1456704 I'll see you.
1456747 1458373 You too.
1458457 1462377 Hey, Steps, come on, let's go.<br />Say good night to your friend.
1462503 1466047 What are you doin' out with no hat on?<br />Did you get something to eat?
1466132 1469551 - Did you eat your dinner?<br />- Yeah, I already ate.
1469593 1472554 You're late, you know?<br />I've told you...
1472680 1474764 Yo, little Marie.
1475724 1479644 Ain't you going to introduce me to your kid?<br />How you doin', Steps?
1479728 1482772 - What's up?<br />- Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,
1482898 1485525 nice little eatery not too far from here.
1485568 1487777 What's all this junk? A tissue...
1487862 1491573 Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo<br />with all the stuff in my pocket.
1491657 1493825 Here you go.<br />I got a card, there it is.
1493909 1499038 And if you ever get a chance, it'd be great<br />if both of yous come down there and eat.
1499123 1501207 It'd be great.<br />Free. You know?
1501250 1504836 Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.
1506255 1509465 I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.
1513429 1515847 See you later.
1517183 1519309 Come on, let's go.
1521729 1526983 You've known what's best for you<br />since you were ten and walked in here alone.
1527109 1529611 Got everything money can buy...
1529653 1532280 except what it can't.
1532406 1534407 It's pride.
1534450 1537911 Pride is what got your ass outta here.
1537953 1541206 Losin' it is what brung you back.
1541290 1546211 But people like you, they need to be tested.<br />Need a challenge.
1546295 1549130 That ain't gonna happen.<br />Ain't nothin' out there.
1549256 1552342 There's always somebody out there.<br />Always.
1552968 1556304 And when you find somethin'<br />standin' in front of you,
1556388 1559015 somethin' that ain't runnin', ain't backin' up,
1559099 1563645 and it's hittin' on you<br />and you're too damn tired to breathe...
1563771 1566773 You find that situation on you, that's good,
1566815 1569359 cos that's baptism under fire.
1571320 1576115 You get through that, you find<br />the only kind of respect that matters -
1576158 1578159 self-respect.
1580871 1583790 Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.
1583832 1586834 Now, what can the champ do for you?
1586961 1591005 You can give me some of that money you got.
1591090 1595093 - You know I like you, Martin.<br />- But not that much.
1600391 1604143 - How about a picture with the kid, Rock?<br />- Sure.
1606272 1611359 Here, son, hold up your fist.<br />Makes you look more hazardous.
1611443 1612735 - There you go.<br />- Thanks.
1612861 1615405 Enjoy your meal.
1615531 1617323 - He's a nice guy.<br />- Rocky?
1617366 1621160 - Yeah?<br />- Listen. Spider just went downstairs.
1621245 1626541 - What's he doin' down there?<br />- I don't know. That's your friend.
1630879 1632213 Yo, Spider.
1632298 1635925 - Let me do some dishes. I feel better.<br />- Oh, come on. You're my guest.
1636051 1638594 - Let me do something.<br />- Keep eating. Guests do.
1638721 1641639 Don't make me fight you again.<br />Last time you got lucky.
1641724 1643725 Lucky? OK.
1643851 1646227 Jesus wants me to work.
1646353 1648646 - Yo, Rocky.<br />- Yeah?
1648731 1651399 You got guests.
1652818 1655445 Don't get too wet, OK?
1655571 1657530 Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
1663912 1667540 - You kept the card.<br />- Yeah, I kept the card.
1667583 1669917 - Why don't you sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
1679595 1684724 Because you know what? I walk in there,<br />I say good morning, I do this, I do this.
1684808 1689062 Tonight, boxing once again.<br />Two contrasting styles in almost every way.
1689104 1692482 - Hey, can you turn this up?<br />- Welcome to ESPN's Then Versus Now.
1692608 1694776 Who was the best of all time?
1694818 1699530 If two athletes from different eras could<br />compete, who would come out on top?
1699615 1703409 Given the same rules, using the same<br />equipment, who was the greatest?
1703452 1705411 We feed our facts into the computer.
1705454 1707997 They will weigh in on<br />who they think is supreme,
1708123 1711334 while fielding the comments<br />of our panel of sports writers.
1717299 1720093 Champ!
1720135 1721803 - Yo, champ!<br />- Yeah?
1721929 1724806 Man, come check out this trash<br />they talkin' about you.
1724932 1727934 - What you talkin' about?<br />- Come check this out. Hurry up.
1727976 1732939 Tonight, the former two-time heavyweight<br />champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.
1732981 1734941 Chuck Johnson, USA Today.
1734983 1739612 Rocky Balboa fought much tougher fights<br />during a much tougher era in boxing.
1739655 1744117 You look at Mason Dixon and his career,<br />he's been spoon-fed his opponents.
1744201 1749664 No question in my mind, not only<br />does Rocky win, but he wins knockout.
1750165 1752166 Rocky!
1753127 1754085 Offspring!
1755295 1758339 - What do you think?<br />- Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.
1758382 1761509 He's never been in real knock-down,<br />drag-out brawls.
1761593 1766139 He's never had to dig down to rally back.<br />If he tries to dig down against Balboa,
1766181 1771394 he's gonna find that he doesn't have a big<br />enough shovel. I clearly give it to Balboa.
1771520 1775857 What happened to you?<br />What happened to you?
1775899 1777400 Burt Randolph Sugar.
1777526 1780862 Dixon has fought cream puffs,<br />so we don't know what he's made of.
1780904 1786325 Both in their primes - and you gotta factor<br />in Dixon's speed, his slashing offence -
1786368 1789203 he cuts Balboa to bits, no doubt.
1789246 1792206 Dixon wins all the way.
1792332 1796794 Here's where our subjectivity ends.<br />Let's see what the computer has to say.
1796879 1800047 Dixon unloads on Balboa.<br />Rocky has no answer.
1800090 1802550 Balboa's eating dirt.
1817900 1822403 Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.<br />He is almost out on his feet.
1822488 1825573 Balboa turning up the heat,<br />hounds him across the ring.
1825699 1829076 He's bitten off more than he can chew<br />this time, believe it.
1829161 1831120 Oh, a murderous right hook!
1831205 1833247 And Dixon is out on his feet!
1833332 1836209 He is out cold<br />as he crumbles to the canvas.
1836293 1839253 And it is Balboa who has won the event!
1841507 1845468 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.
1850933 1856521 I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat that up<br />it's pretty good in the morning.
1856605 1859649 - Yeah, thanks, man.<br />- Nice kid.
1859733 1862318 I hope this music ain't givin' you a headache.
1862444 1864779 No, I like it. It's nice.
1865239 1867240 Well, good. Good.
1876583 1879377 Yo. You think Steps wants a job?
1879461 1882588 Make a few bucks in a weekend.<br />It's good makin' your own G.
1882631 1885132 My kid stashed a few bucks doin' that.
1885259 1888052 Why are you being so nice?
1888136 1893641 I don't want you to think nothing's off,<br />you know? My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.
1893725 1898729 - Yeah, I wasn't thinkin' that, believe me.<br />- No? Then what was you thinkin'?
1898814 1901440 That you don't owe us nothin'.<br />What are you doin'?
1901525 1903442 Be patient.
1903527 1907446 No, I don't owe you nothin',
1907489 1912076 but why you gotta owe something to get...
1912160 1913995 Yo! Yikes.
1914121 1916414 Bingo.
1920836 1924005 But why you gotta owe something<br />to get something, you know?
1924131 1926173 Really.
1927968 1931846 I think hangin' out with your kid<br />would be nice. What do you think?
1931930 1934140 I think that'd be nice.
1935183 1936976 Good.
1937019 1940479 That's very nice.<br />I'm glad you come by.
1941356 1944233 Nice... nice watchin' you eat.
1946612 1948571 Good company.
1951366 1954035 Yo, little Marie.<br />Let there be light.
1965005 1967173 - You like dogs?<br />- Dogs?
1967257 1970009 Dogs. This is, like, a dog pound.
1970052 1972345 It's where they keep...
1972429 1974680 a large variety of dogs.
1974723 1980853 I used to come here for sightseein',<br />but, you know, you learn a lot talkin' to dogs.
1980896 1984482 - Really, you do.<br />- Yeah, man.
1984566 1987193 Hey, man, how about this one?
1988612 1993407 - He don't look too friendly, my friend.<br />- This is the one. Hey, boy, how you doin'?
1993450 1997411 - What about this one? Come here, boy.<br />- Who, him?
1997496 2000706 - Yeah, why not?<br />- Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
2000749 2002875 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.
2002918 2006754 If you look at it closely,<br />the colour kinda looks like old furniture,
2006838 2009423 like some kinda pirate chest thing goin' on.
2009549 2011926 Yeah, sure, man.<br />Hey, how about a young one?
2011968 2015596 Forget him. Come over here a minute.<br />I want you to see something.
2015639 2020017 Now, you notice what this animal<br />is doin' here, lyin' in that position?
2020102 2024438 - He ain't doin' nothin'.<br />- He's doin' a lot. He ain't wastin' no energy.
2024564 2026941 Cos he's dead.
2032239 2034990 There's a lot of good mileage<br />left in that animal.
2035075 2039161 Some good food, the addition of a couple<br />of new friends - bingo, he's back.
2039246 2042665 - But what do you think's a good name?<br />- It's your dog. You name him.
2042791 2045459 Hey, no. It's a community animal.<br />50-50.
2045544 2048295 Look, I don't know much about no dogs.
2048338 2052466 Well, you know, Steps, it ain't that<br />complicated. You pet 'em, you feed 'em,
2052509 2056971 and nature takes its course, you know.<br />Don't you wanna name an animal?
2057055 2061434 I think every guy should one time<br />try to name an animal something.
2061476 2063477 I don't know. Fleabag.
2063520 2067815 It's catchy. You know,<br />it ain't original but it's pretty good.
2067941 2073487 I think you could come up with in your<br />young brain something better than Fleabag.
2074197 2076157 Punchy. How's that?
2077617 2080119 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah, Punchy.
2083749 2085833 - I like it, you know?<br />- For real?
2085876 2089086 For real. Punchy it is.<br />I think Punchy's easy to remember,
2089171 2093424 it's not that hard to spell, and then once<br />it's in your brain you never forget it.
2093508 2095760 - Punchy. Very good.<br />- All right, man.
2095844 2098679 Good call. All right, Punchy.
2098764 2100931 You ready to be bailed out, my friend?
2101016 2104101 OK. Hey.
2104186 2110191 - You know I was just joking with you, right?<br />- Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.
2143558 2145559 Rocky?
2148605 2150648 Excuse me.
2155570 2157238 - Rock.<br />- Yo, Paulie.
2157364 2160866 Hey, they're gonna be talking<br />about that fake Looney Tune fight.
2160909 2163786 Hey, come on.<br />We're about to serve today's special.
2163912 2167414 Italian food cooked by a bunch of Mexicans<br />ain't so special, Rocko.
2167499 2169917 Hey, yo.
2170836 2173504 Hey, I skipped work for this.
2176132 2178592 What an ugly dog.
2180095 2183264 It's a cute dog.
2183932 2186475 Hey, Rock.<br />I'm gonna take off, all right?
2186560 2189019 - That stuff back there is cool.<br />- You like that?
2189104 2191230 - Yeah, man.<br />- Thanks. I appreciate it.
2191273 2194692 - I'm gonna catch you later.<br />- All right.
2199072 2201240 - Who's the criminal?<br />- He's a nice kid.
2201283 2203117 He dresses like a bum.
2203660 2207454 Coming from a human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.
2207497 2210624 - Hide the silverware.<br />- That's nice.
2212836 2214920 Hey, Spider.
2218592 2220926 Didn't you knock out that bum once?
2220969 2223304 Will you give it a rest?
2233356 2236817 I'm gonna be late for work for this.<br />Give me a break, huh?
2236860 2239862 All right, just for a few seconds.
2239988 2243532 In the late '60s a simulated fight<br />took place between two legends,
2243658 2245868 Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.
2245994 2247703 Marciano, long retired,
2247829 2250748 and Ali, unable to fight legitimately<br />for three years
2250832 2253334 for refusing induction<br />into the armed forces,
2253418 2256337 was in need of money<br />and agreed to the dream match
2256421 2259131 whose outcome would be decided<br />by a computer.
2259174 2263928 It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano<br />won the much-disputed computer decision
2264012 2266847 and guess what -<br />not much has changed.
2266973 2272311 - Last week, Rocky Balboa won...<br />- That's the cartoon fight I told you about.
2272354 2274021 Yeah.
2274064 2278359 A stunning knockout. And keep in mind<br />this is taking the human factor out of it.
2278485 2281862 - Whoa, that was beautiful.<br />- Rocky Balboa would be triumphant.
2281988 2285449 KO 13, and here's some of the fallout.
2285533 2289536 What started as a form of entertainment<br />has now become this rallying cry
2289621 2293248 for people who think an old-school athlete<br />like Balboa could be better,
2293375 2297044 so computer technology has to create<br />what isn't. That's irresponsible.
2297128 2299129 Get therapy, will you?
2299214 2301882 Skip, how do you think Balboa<br />would do against Dixon?
2302008 2305386 Badly. Personally, I think Balboa<br />was completely overrated.
2305512 2307471 You know he owns a restaurant.
2307555 2310057 What's the specialty?<br />Pounded chicken?
2310100 2312977 I would have paid to see the fight.<br />Next topic, NASCAR,
2313061 2317773 and the controversy that won't go away.<br />Let's go back to Sunday's race.
2317899 2320776 Hey, hey, hey. Cheer up.<br />Free advertisement.
2320902 2323237 Come on. Meat house calls.
2333248 2335249 Yo, Robert.
2337585 2341797 - What are you doing out so late?<br />- I tried callin' but nothing was pickin' up.
2341923 2345509 - Is something wrong?<br />- No, no, I just wanted to see you in person.
2345593 2349972 - You wanna come inside?<br />- I wanna get your opinion on something.
2350056 2354018 - Sure. Opinion on what?<br />- They say you only go around once, right?
2354102 2356478 - Yeah, I've heard that.<br />- Well...
2356604 2359189 I think I wanna, like, do something.
2359274 2361275 - Like what?<br />- Fight.
2363069 2366613 You know, nothing big.<br />Small stuff, like locally.
2368533 2371952 Don't you think you're too, you know, old?
2371995 2375664 You think you oughta stop tryin'<br />cos you had too many birthdays?
2375790 2378000 - I do not.<br />- People'll think you're crazy.
2378126 2382129 What's crazy about standin' toe-to-toe<br />saying, "I am," you know?
2382213 2385299 That's just the ego talkin'.
2385341 2388969 Look, what are you tryin' to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
2389012 2394016 Prove? Listen, I... I stopped thinkin'<br />the way other people think a long time ago.
2394142 2397478 You know, you gotta think like you think.
2397604 2400147 - I do.<br />- Do you? Good.
2400273 2403484 You gotta... you gotta face reality.
2403568 2406820 OK? It's... it's a different world now.
2406863 2409490 Only the clothes is different.
2411284 2414328 I really don't know what you want from me.
2414829 2419666 I just want us to get involved,<br />you know, like a home team.
2421628 2427132 Look, whatever it is,<br />whatever you're going through, it'll pass.
2427175 2432012 - Yeah, you're probably right.<br />- Time, it's gonna catch up to all of us.
2432097 2436600 - Especially if you're standin' still.<br />- Hey, come on.
2438478 2441855 Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.
2443608 2446110 - Did you tell your kid?<br />- I did.
2446194 2448403 - He think you're nuts?<br />- Yeah.
2448738 2451490 Well, he don't believe in you?
2451533 2454409 Welcome to my world, buddy.
2454494 2457746 Rocko, nobody's givin' you no title shot.
2457831 2460290 I know that.<br />I don't want one.
2460375 2462918 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
2464045 2465420 No.
2465547 2469049 You're mad because<br />they took down your statue?
2469175 2470217 No.
2471803 2475556 - Not really, no.<br />- If it's about money,
2475682 2482020 just hang a sign around your neck saying,<br />"Punch me, $5." You'll make big money.
2483690 2486150 What? You haven't peaked yet?
2486901 2489403 - Peaked?<br />- Yeah, peaked.
2489904 2493240 I don't know. There's still<br />some stuff in the basement.
2493366 2495576 - What basement?<br />- In here.
2496744 2500706 - Tell me about the stuff.<br />- What about it?
2500748 2506170 - Tell me about the stuff inside. Is it angry?<br />- Angry?
2506254 2510924 - Are you mad because Adrian left you?<br />- She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
2511050 2512926 OK. OK, OK, OK.
2517515 2521185 You know, some...<br />sometimes it's hard to breathe.
2521269 2525272 You know, I feel, like, this beast inside me.
2525315 2528066 It's OK, Rocko.<br />Please, it's OK.
2528109 2531653 Is it... OK?
2537035 2540746 I... I just never knew<br />it was supposed to be this hard.
2540788 2545209 It wasn't supposed to be like this,<br />Paulie, you know?
2553635 2557471 - You wanna come by and help me train?<br />- I got a job here.
2557555 2559640 I understand.
2559766 2564895 Remember you said if you stay one place<br />long enough you become that place?
2564979 2567231 Rocko, this is all I got.
2567315 2570567 I understand, Paulie. I do.
2574739 2579493 Well, if you get time and maybe come down<br />and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
2579619 2581662 Of course, Rocko.
2584916 2586708 Bye, Paulie.
2586834 2588794 Goodbye, Rocko.
2591506 2593507 Take care, Rocko.
2598888 2603850 This plenary session of the Pennsylvania<br />Athletic Commission is convened
2603977 2608355 in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa
2608398 2612818 for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing licence
2612860 2617656 due to his ineligibility<br />to be licensed as a matter of right.
2617699 2621743 Mr Balboa, you are welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself,
2621828 2625038 we invite you to make<br />an opening statement if you'd like to.
2625123 2627833 No, I'm just curious how I did, that's all.
2627875 2632546 All right. Well, the medical advisory board<br />has informed us
2632672 2635590 that the tests to which<br />you have been subjected,
2635675 2639136 you've passed these tests with flying colours.
2639220 2642556 - And we congratulate you for that.<br />- Thanks.
2642640 2646601 However, this commission<br />in good conscience
2646728 2648895 cannot recommend you for a licence,
2648938 2652316 and we therefore deny your application.
2653818 2656570 - Didn't I do what you asked?<br />- Yes, you did.
2656696 2660032 - So I should get a licence, right?<br />- Not exactly.
2662952 2666538 So why'd you give me all them tests<br />if you was never passin' me?
2666581 2669082 We've got to stand by our decision here,
2669208 2674046 and we have to deny your request<br />for a licence at this time.
2684474 2689394 - Yo, don't I got some rights?<br />- What rights are you referring to?
2689479 2693231 - Like in that official paper they wrote.<br />- That's the Bill of Rights.
2693274 2696651 Don't it say something<br />about goin' after what makes you happy?
2696736 2699780 No, that's the pursuit of happiness.<br />What's your point?
2699906 2703116 I'm pursuing something<br />and nobody looks happy about it.
2703159 2705786 But we're just looking out for your interests.
2705828 2709706 But maybe you're lookin' out<br />for your interests just a little bit more.
2709791 2713460 You shouldn't ask people to come<br />and pay the freight on somethin',
2713503 2716505 they pay, they're still not good enough.<br />Is that right?
2716631 2720467 Maybe you're doin' your job,<br />but why you gotta stop me from doin' mine?
2720510 2724346 If you're willin' to go through the battling<br />to get to where you wanna get,
2724472 2726264 who's got the right to stop you?
2726307 2730060 Maybe you guys got something<br />you never finished, you really wanna do,
2730144 2734481 you never said to somebody - something!<br />You're told no after you pay your dues.
2734524 2738944 Who's got the right to tell you that? Nobody!<br />It's your right to listen to your gut.
2738986 2745158 It ain't nobody's right to say no after you<br />earned the right to do what you wanna do!
2748371 2752624 You know, the older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.
2752667 2758505 The only thing I'm asking you guys<br />to leave on the table is what's right.
2774605 2776690 Yo! Have you seen the paper today?
2776732 2779192 Front row. Front row.
2779318 2781194 That is so great.
2781237 2784364 - All right, all right.<br />- You know what? Let's go get some food.
2784407 2787701 - Come on, come on. Hey!<br />- Robert, come on.
2788494 2793331 The last pay-per-views were in the toilet.<br />You're not makin' championship money.
2793374 2795500 There's a bunch of nobodies out there.
2795543 2798503 I wanna talk to you<br />about an interesting opportunity.
2798546 2802507 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a licence and got one, yeah?
2802550 2804551 - Yeah. Forget about it.<br />- Hear me out.
2804677 2808054 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands behind my back?
2808181 2811725 Everybody knows you can beat the guy,<br />but that's not what it's about.
2811767 2815187 It's about money. We gotta capitalise<br />on that computer fight.
2815229 2817939 This could do a million buys.<br />15, 20 million to you.
2818065 2821193 - Forget about it.<br />- Then what do you wanna do?
2821235 2824237 - Look, man, we got guaranteed fights.<br />- We don't.
2824280 2827574 You wanna do this now, I'll do it now.<br />We got nothing, Mace.
2827617 2831203 All the fights you come up with<br />all got rejected. You know why?
2831245 2835415 They're all bums out there. Nobody cares<br />about them. There's no marquee value.
2835458 2839461 But this Balboa thing is interesting<br />because... Listen to me.
2839587 2843590 It's a has-been-never-gonna-be world.<br />Call it nostalgia if you want,
2843633 2845592 but people can relate to that stuff.
2845676 2848261 - This is a no-lose. It's all good.<br />- Good for who?
2848304 2851473 For you! Not for me, for you!<br />Maybe you don't understand.
2851599 2855268 People don't like you no more.<br />They're not supporting you any more.
2855353 2857270 Don't you understand that?
2857355 2861608 Don't look at me like I'm messin' with your<br />legacy. Every jock thinks they got a legacy.
2861651 2864152 A legacy is what you get<br />instead of getting paid.
2864278 2866947 - Hey, don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />- I'm not.
2866989 2870617 Everybody knows you could kick<br />this old man's ass, but you don't.
2870743 2874746 You leave him with a bit of dignity.<br />So they say, "Mason's got compassion. "
2874789 2879167 "He's a decent guy. " You got a whole new<br />audience who'll double your money.
2879293 2883505 - Want a new image? That's how you get it.<br />- To replace the one that you two made?
2883631 2886299 Wait. We made your world green.<br />You made the rest.
2886384 2890262 - You made all this junk happen.<br />- I've had it up to here with this mess, man.
2890304 2894724 - I'm goin' back to Martin's gym.<br />- All right, we'll talk about this crap.
2894809 2897352 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.
2908072 2909990 - How you doin'?<br />- What a surprise.
2910074 2914661 I was drivin' around the neighbourhood.<br />I thought, "Why not drive by and say hello?"
2914704 2917497 - Do you wanna come inside?<br />- The dog needs exercise.
2917540 2919541 - Do you want to take a walk?<br />- Yeah.
2919667 2922168 - It's nice outside.<br />- All right.
2922295 2924838 - Nice and brisk.<br />- When did you get a dog?
2924964 2927465 We picked up Punchy a couple of days back.
2927508 2930302 Punchy. You named a dog Punchy?
2930344 2934639 - Actually, your kid come up with the name.<br />- Yeah? I think that's disrespectful.
2934682 2936933 No, no, it's fine, really, no.
2937018 2940103 It's easy to remember,<br />and it's all that, you know.
2940187 2943356 What do you think about<br />comin' over to the restaurant?
2943441 2947235 - What for?<br />- Well, you know, for, like... for work.
2947320 2950030 The hostess is gonna be having a kid.<br />You'd do good.
2950114 2952824 - I don't know.<br />- I'm telling you, you'd do good.
2952908 2956202 I appreciate what you're doin' for my kid,<br />but I can't.
2956287 2960749 Hey, listen. I think you'd like it a lot.<br />It's a nice environment. It's very pleasant.
2960875 2963043 Can we drop it?
2965212 2966880 What's botherin' you?
2966964 2971635 - Nothin'. It's all right. I gotta get back.<br />- No, it ain't all right.
2971719 2973553 - Oh, come on.<br />- What?
2973596 2975889 I'm the first person people see?
2975973 2979643 Yeah. You just give out menus,<br />say hello, sit people down.
2979727 2982729 Look, little Marie, if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.
2982813 2986232 You could find ten better people,<br />100 better people for this job.
2986359 2990236 - Give it a try. Like, two weeks.<br />- I don't wanna try.
2990321 2992572 - Who put this stuff in your head?<br />- Nobody.
2992698 2996201 Well, it just don't get in there by itself.
2998245 3000372 Thanks for comin' by.
3002083 3006711 Yo. When was the last time you went dancin'?<br />Has it been a while?
3006754 3010090 - Why are you askin'?<br />- Cos you're dancin' around these problems,
3010132 3015387 you might as well dance with me. I ain't that<br />good, but I'm better than the average bear.
3015429 3019474 - And where that came from, I don't know.<br />- You're crazy.
3019600 3024437 A little bit. But the way you're thinkin',<br />the way you're talkin', it's a little crazy too.
3024563 3028233 Come on. You deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
3028275 3032779 I need you to class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
3032905 3036533 And if you say, "Screw you, creepo," again<br />I totally understand,
3036617 3041204 but I warn you, I'm gonna put myself, like,<br />geographically in the middle of the street
3041288 3044416 and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />wave to the first bus and say:
3044458 3048962 "Come over here and mash me, cos Marie<br />turned down the job at the restaurant. "
3049088 3051548 - "She thinks she's better than us. "<br />- Oh, yeah?
3051632 3054676 Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
3054760 3056803 - Yeah?<br />- No.
3058681 3060515 That was a close call.
3061559 3064144 Listen, seriously.
3064270 3066980 Come on over. It'll be nice.
3069275 3071276 All right.
3088961 3090837 Paulie!
3093758 3095842 Sorry, Paulie.
3097011 3099012 Sorry.
3130002 3133087 How are you?<br />Get my unusual up there.
3133214 3136174 Excuse me.<br />Deliveries are in the back.
3136217 3140011 - I'm not a delivery guy.<br />- Well, do you have a reservation?
3140054 3142931 Do I look like a freakin' Indian?
3145893 3147894 Hey, Rock. Rocky?
3152775 3155735 I think we got a little bit of a problem<br />with this guy.
3155861 3158905 A problem?<br />No, no, he's just a relative.
3158989 3160657 OK.
3163577 3164702 Yo, Paulie.
3166914 3168873 - What happened to your eye?<br />- I hit it.
3168958 3171084 - Why?<br />- Needed to.
3171752 3174629 - What happened?<br />- I'm celebratin', Rock.
3174713 3177048 - Why?<br />- I retired.
3177508 3179592 Retired?
3179718 3181719 Yeah?
3184390 3189894 So when'd they start giving retired people<br />meat instead of watches, Paulie?
3192106 3194440 I don't need a watch.
3195776 3197777 I got a watch!
3197903 3200780 - You gave me a watch!<br />- Paulie...
3200906 3203783 I don't need a goddamn watch.
3205119 3207787 - Yo, Paulie.<br />- I got a watch!
3209623 3211624 I got two watches!
3212126 3214127 Yo, Paulie!
3226390 3229100 Yo, Paulie.
3229143 3230810 Rock.
3230936 3237233 It takes guts to climb back in that ring<br />knowin' you're gonna take a beating.
3238193 3243489 - You're gonna do all right, Rocko.<br />- How do you know that?
3243574 3246367 The stuff in the basement.
3257004 3259005 Thanks, Paulie.
3263636 3265637 OK?
3267848 3270099 - You OK?<br />- Yeah, yeah. Good. How are you?
3270184 3274771 - Oh, yeah, fine. This is great.<br />- Some guys over there wanna talk to you.
3274855 3276856 - OK.<br />- OK?
3281028 3283696 - Thanks for comin' by.<br />- No problem. Our pleasure.
3283822 3286532 - You wanna hear some stories?<br />- What kind?
3286617 3290536 - A lot of people like to hear fight stories.<br />- Maybe later.
3290621 3295041 I'm Lou DiBella. This is LC Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixon's manager.
3295167 3298044 - Will you sit down and join us?<br />- Sure.
3299463 3303883 We have the promotional contract for<br />Mason Dixon - who's a big fan, by the way.
3304009 3307053 When he heard you were interested<br />in fighting, he thought,
3307179 3313226 why not try and work something out? Like<br />a special event, a first-class exhibition fight.
3313268 3315895 - Why me?<br />- He respects the hell outta you.
3315938 3320900 And that computer fight got people curious.<br />This could be very interesting.
3321026 3324362 But I ain't interested in getting<br />mangled and embarrassed.
3324405 3326698 No, that's not gonna happen. Never.
3326740 3333246 Truthfully, I was thinkin'<br />more on a, like, minuscule small level.
3333288 3336207 You know, small fights.<br />Not big fights. Small fights.
3336250 3339419 Things that... Local.<br />You know what I mean? Not...
3339503 3341754 Not a bad idea.<br />But don't think of it as big.
3341797 3345258 Think of it like an exhibition,<br />as a glorified sparring session.
3345300 3349470 And here's something you'll like -<br />we'll donate a portion of the gate to charity.
3349596 3353599 - Well, that's always nice.<br />- It's good to give.
3353726 3355810 - Where is it taking place?<br />- Las Vegas.
3355894 3360189 Las Vegas. Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killin' you.
3360274 3361274 A little stiff.
3361358 3363860 - You move better when you're warmer.<br />- Yeah.
3363944 3367613 And if nothing else,<br />you'll have new stories to tell.
3367656 3370616 - I really gotta think about this.<br />- Absolutely.
3370659 3372952 - Is that OK?<br />- I understand. No problem.
3373037 3376664 - I'm gonna go. You can order something.<br />- What do you recommend?
3376790 3378958 It's all edible.
3380711 3382712 OK. Thanks.
3384006 3387800 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime.
3387843 3389635 - He'd kill him.<br />- No kiddin'.
3390971 3392972 Man, I'm confused.
3400606 3405276 - I didn't think this would come along.<br />- But this is what you wanted, right?
3405319 3409155 You know, I talk and I talk and sometimes<br />I think what I'm saying is true,
3409239 3413618 and then, you know, I look at myself<br />and I'm not even sure what is true any more
3413660 3418498 cos it's like I push this crazy idea about<br />fightin'... I mean, what's it all about?
3418540 3421626 Do I care about standin' toe-to-toe<br />and all that stuff?
3421668 3425379 Or like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?
3425506 3429342 Or am I this old pug who's just tryin'<br />to replace old pain with new pain?
3429384 3432053 I don't know. I-I don't know.
3433764 3436682 Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.
3436767 3440895 I'm always listenin' and lookin' and...
3441021 3445191 But, you know, who you are, you know,<br />the part of you that's so full of life,
3445234 3448236 I mean, we all have that feeling, that fire,
3448362 3452865 but we usually never get a chance to use it<br />and then it just goes away.
3452950 3456702 But you can.<br />You've got this opportunity, so do it.
3456829 3462333 Why not? I mean, this is who you are,<br />you know? This is who you'll always be.
3462376 3465920 And you don't move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.
3466046 3468881 And it doesn't matter<br />how this looks to other people.
3469007 3472718 All that matters is how it looks to you.
3473387 3475888 Rocky.
3475973 3478933 Rocky, look at me.
3479393 3482812 How it looks to you.
3483772 3488067 And if this is something that you wanna do<br />and if this is something that you gotta do,
3488152 3490486 then you do it.
3491405 3493739 Fighters fight.
3496827 3499453 You're not gonna punch me, are you?
3502791 3507920 All right, listen. I gotta go before I wear out<br />my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
3508005 3510173 Thanks.
3520017 3521976 Fighters fight, right?
3528609 3532486 It's rare when you get to promote an event<br />that's bigger than boxing. This is.
3532613 3536574 Skill versus will,<br />with part of the proceeds going to charity.
3536617 3540912 The brainchild of Mason Dixon,<br />to honour past heavyweight champions.
3540954 3545374 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
3545459 3549837 A few great fighters have fought<br />in their 50s with disastrous results.
3549963 3554342 Why risk the danger and embarrassment?<br />The smart money says you have no chance.
3554468 3559764 A puncher always has a chance.<br />This fight will be competitive.
3559806 3561974 Why are you doing this, Rocky?
3562059 3566312 I don't know.<br />I'd rather do something I love badly than...
3566396 3571817 Than... than to feel bad<br />by not doin' something you love.
3571860 3574487 The press has labelled you<br />a Balboasaurus.
3575822 3577990 How do you feel about that?
3578033 3582328 Mason, say the following happens.<br />You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
3582371 3585873 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
3585999 3588209 You all know that'd never happen.
3588335 3594674 This is only an exhibition. Don't go tryin'<br />to make more of this than that computer tried.
3594716 3598386 Isn't this sport in enough trouble<br />without circus events?
3598512 3600346 Next question.
3600472 3604642 This looks like a cheap bit<br />of ring theatre between a has-been
3604685 3608020 and a man whose own credible legacy<br />and popularity is in doubt.
3608146 3610898 - What's the upside?<br />- Doubt? Upside?
3611024 3613901 I mean... What do you mean, upside?
3614027 3616362 I mean, what do I have to do?
3617698 3621200 I'm 33 and 0, with 30 knockouts.<br />I'm doin' you people a favour.
3621326 3625204 I'm havin' this exhibition for you,<br />and you gonna make a mockery out of me?
3625289 3629000 I'm the champ. I mean,<br />I get pissed, this guy get hurt.
3629710 3631627 See you at the fight.
3635716 3639510 The guy's a joke.<br />He's gonna get crushed.
3646893 3648686 Oh, look who's here.
3648729 3652857 - How you doin'? Have you seen my father?<br />- He's in the back.
3652899 3655359 We've never served this many meals.
3655444 3659530 And you're doin' good?<br />You're enjoyin' everything, right?
3661325 3663576 Excuse me.
3664578 3666912 How you doin'?
3666955 3669874 - Glad you come by.<br />- Can I talk with you?
3669916 3672710 - Sure.<br />- Can we do it outside?
3677424 3680551 - You're going through with this?<br />- I start training tomorrow.
3680594 3683846 Hey, Rock.<br />I made some connections.
3683930 3687433 I can make some money on this.<br />Endorsements.
3687517 3689602 - Absolutely. Do that.<br />- Thank you.
3689686 3692104 - Sure.<br />- OK.
3692189 3695608 - So you nervous about the fight?<br />- Yeah, scared to death.
3695734 3698569 - You don't look scared.<br />- Well, I ain't supposed to.
3698612 3701113 Then you don't have to do it.
3701239 3703407 Yeah, well, I think I do.
3706578 3709872 You know, living with you,<br />it hasn't been easy.
3709956 3712625 People see me but they think of you.
3712751 3715586 With this going on,<br />it's gonna be worse than ever.
3715629 3717671 - It don't have to be.<br />- Sure it does.
3717756 3720591 - Why? You got a lot goin' on, kid.<br />- What, my last name?
3720634 3725054 That's the reason I got a decent job,<br />why people deal with me in the first place.
3725138 3730976 Now I start to get a little ahead, to get a little<br />something for myself, and this happens.
3731103 3734939 Now, I'm asking you as a favour<br />not to go through with this, OK?
3734981 3737817 This is only gonna end up<br />bad for you and bad for me.
3737859 3740694 - You think I'm hurtin' you?<br />- Yeah. In a way you are.
3740821 3744698 - It's the last thing I ever wanted to do.<br />- I know that's not what you wanna do,
3744825 3748327 but that's just the way that it is.<br />Don't you care what people think?
3748453 3752998 Doesn't it bother you that people make you<br />out to be a joke and I'll be included in that?
3753041 3755084 Do you think that's right?
3755168 3757253 Do you?
3762175 3764760 You ain't gonna believe this,
3764845 3767263 but you used to fit right here.
3767347 3769598 I'd hold you up and say to your mother:
3769683 3772351 "This kid's gonna be<br />the best kid in the world. "
3772436 3775813 "This kid's gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew. "
3775856 3778774 And you grew up good and wonderful.
3778859 3782194 It was great just watching.<br />Every day was like a privilege.
3782237 3786365 Then the time come for you to be your own<br />man and take on the world, and you did.
3786450 3791495 But somewhere along the line,<br />you changed. You stopped bein' you.
3791538 3795082 You let people stick a finger in your face<br />and tell you you're no good,
3795208 3798878 and when things got hard, you started<br />lookin' for somethin' to blame.
3798920 3800921 Like a big shadow.
3802591 3807386 I'll tell you something you already know.<br />The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
3807512 3811390 It's a very mean and nasty place.<br />And I don't care how tough you are,
3811516 3815603 it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there permanently if you let it.
3815729 3819857 You, me, or nobody<br />is gonna hit as hard as life.
3819900 3822026 But it ain't about how hard you hit.
3822068 3825738 It's about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep movin' forward.
3825822 3829074 How much you can take<br />and keep movin' forward.
3829201 3831911 That's how winnin' is done!
3832037 3834830 If you know what you're worth,<br />get what you're worth,
3834915 3838334 but you gotta be willin' to take the hits<br />and not pointin' fingers,
3838418 3842588 sayin' you ain't where you wanna be<br />because of him or her or anybody!
3842672 3844840 Cowards do that, and that ain't you!
3844925 3846967 You're better than that!
3853600 3856977 I'm always gonna love you no matter what,
3857103 3859271 no matter what happens.
3859397 3862441 You're my son and you're my blood.
3862484 3865152 You're the best thing in my life.
3866321 3872451 But until you start believin' in yourself,<br />you ain't gonna have a life.
3875080 3877957 Don't forget to visit your mother.
3927465 3930134 - Yeah, those are beautiful.<br />- Yeah.
3932012 3935180 - You get off early from work?<br />- No.
3935640 3938475 I left. I quit.
3939978 3942605 Quit? Why?
3942689 3945566 I wasn't very...
3945692 3950779 I don't know. I just...<br />I didn't... I didn't fit in there.
3950864 3953324 I understand.
3956953 3960164 - So what are you gonna do?<br />- Right now?
3961708 3965085 Right now I'd rather be with you.
3966713 3968881 That all right?
3970050 3971800 Yeah.
3971885 3976221 It's been a long time since I've seen a fight.
3986733 3992237 You know all about fightin' so there's<br />no sense us goin' down that road again.
3992280 3995074 To beat this guy, you need speed.
3995575 3998202 You don't have it.
3998244 4001955 And your knees can't take the poundin',<br />so hard runnin' is out.
4002082 4004083 And you got arthritis in your neck,
4004167 4007836 and you've got calcium deposits<br />on most of your joints,
4007921 4010255 so sparrin' is out.
4010340 4012466 I had that problem.
4012592 4017763 So what we'll be callin' on<br />is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.
4017889 4022768 Horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron,<br />pile-drivin' punches
4022852 4026438 that will have to hurt so much<br />they'll rattle his ancestors.
4026481 4032653 Every time you hit him with a shot, it's gotta<br />feel like he tried kissin' the express train.
4032779 4036615 Yeah! Let's start buildin'<br />some hurtin' bombs.
4068690 4073152 - You'll get it. You'll get it.<br />- You can do it, Rocko.
4107520 4109855 Gettin' stronger!
4127081 4128582 Come on, Rocko!
4136049 4138258 Come on, come on.<br />There you go.
4138384 4139885 There you go.
4143723 4146725 You can do it, Rocko.
4148269 4150938 Gettin' stronger!
4151439 4152648 Three.
4152732 4154399 Four. Five.
4187600 4189601 Yeah!
4198945 4202781 Rocky Balboa, 217.
4203783 4207411 The undisputed heavyweight champion<br />Mason Dixon,
4207453 4210414 221.
4212792 4217713 Thank you very much.<br />I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
4232312 4234396 - You know how much money is in this?<br />- A lot.
4234480 4237816 Imagine tryin' to clean this place.<br />No, seriously.
4237942 4239943 Balboa.
4242113 4244907 You guys, I'll catch up with you all later, OK?
4244991 4247451 Robert, I want you to hang with me.
4248578 4251830 - How you doin', champ?<br />- I'm good.
4252832 4255417 There's no reason<br />for neither one of us to get hurt.
4255460 4260631 I'll do my best to carry you, make sure<br />you save face. There'd be no embarrassment.
4260715 4263717 But I promise you, if you try to press me,
4263843 4270182 you hit me, you hurt me, you hit me low,<br />cheap-shot me, I'll get you outta there.
4270308 4274394 You know, a lot of people<br />come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
4274520 4277981 - It's already over.<br />- Ain't nothin' over till it's over.
4278024 4282444 - What's that from? The '80s?<br />- That's probably the '70s.
4285239 4288200 Just remember what I said.
4288242 4290327 Hey, yo, champ.
4290370 4293038 Yo, ain't you a little scared?
4293122 4294998 I don't get scared.
4298127 4304341 I think you try a little harder when you're<br />scared. This is what has worked for me.
4305051 4307386 - I ain't scared.<br />- You ain't scared of me?
4307512 4311556 Come on, let's see what you got.<br />Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
4327240 4329074 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
4329200 4331868 - I hope I didn't wake you.<br />- No. You wanna come in?
4331911 4333412 No. It's OK.
4333496 4338709 I just wanted to - I don't know - come by<br />and wish you good luck for tomorrow.
4338751 4342629 - Thanks.<br />- Yeah. Um... I brought you something.
4342755 4347300 I hope you don't mind.<br />I took it from the restaurant.
4347427 4349261 Adrian.
4349387 4351972 Yeah. I thought she would<br />keep you safe, you know.
4352098 4356768 - Yeah, she always brought me luck.<br />- Yeah.
4357270 4363066 Yeah. Listen, I wanted to say thanks<br />for everything you've done for me and my kid.
4363151 4364943 You've been great.
4369365 4371533 You know, tomorrow...
4372744 4378790 you're gonna prove that the last thing<br />to age in somebody is their heart.
4378875 4381084 - I'll try.<br />- You go show 'em.
4381127 4383211 Thank you.
4403941 4407861 The heavyweight championship<br />has been one of sport's most coveted titles
4407987 4409821 for 120 years.
4409864 4413784 Two-time heavyweight champion<br />Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia slugger,
4413826 4419206 renowned for his cast-iron jaw,<br />ferocious body attack and will of steel,
4419332 4422626 which have carried the smaller fighter<br />to numerous victories
4422710 4425504 against physically superior opponents.
4425588 4428507 And Mason Dixon,<br />the current heavyweight title holder,
4428591 4431802 with all the speed and determination<br />any fighter could want.
4431886 4436014 But many still question whether<br />he has the heart of a true champion,
4436099 4440685 never having been pushed to go the distance.<br />Tonight, we find out.
4440812 4444147 We're at the Mandalay Bay Events Center<br />in Las Vegas, Nevada,
4444190 4448235 for the much-anticipated showdown<br />between Mason "The Line" Dixon
4448361 4451738 and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
4451864 4454658 I'm Jim Lampley, with Larry Merchant<br />and Max Kellerman,
4454742 4456993 live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas,
4457036 4461623 where we anticipate one of the most<br />compelling events in boxing history -
4461707 4465377 the current unappreciated<br />heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon,
4465503 4467379 putting his reputation on the line
4467463 4471508 against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion,<br />Rocky Balboa.
4471551 4474886 Even though most see this<br />as a glorified sparring session,
4475012 4477013 the energy in the room is electric.
4477056 4479266 Why is this billed as an exhibition?
4479392 4483311 A wild guess - so they wouldn't<br />have to call it an execution.
4484313 4491069 Zechariah 4:6 says, "It is not by strength,<br />not by might, but by his Spirit. "
4491154 4496825 We have already claimed the victory<br />in our Lord Jesus Christ.
4496909 4501079 - Good luck, Rocky.<br />- Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.
4512341 4516553 Nobody's expecting much, I think,<br />from the way-past-his-prime former champ
4516596 4517762 Rocky Balboa.
4518264 4521516 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
4522268 4528940 Look. Look, I know you got a lot of stuff<br />you gotta get out of your system, huh?
4529066 4531276 Tonight you do it. Right?
4531402 4533695 Get rid of the damn beast.
4533779 4536615 Let it be done once and for all.
4536741 4539242 Please, I love you.
4547793 4553632 There go the lights. The buzz is building<br />toward a roaring crescendo.
4568356 4570607 Where'd that come from?
4570650 4573652 I chose it. I love Sinatra.
4574195 4576404 He's very good, Sinatra.
4576489 4578698 - Let's go.<br />- Very good.
4581369 4586248 And here comes Rocky Balboa,<br />a veteran of the wars,
4586332 4589084 here for one more last hurrah.
4589168 4592212 Or the Last Supper,<br />with him as the main course.
4592338 4595006 What's that music?<br />You can't be serious.
4595132 4598009 "High Hopes"?<br />Talk about wishful thinking.
4598052 4602222 Maybe "no hopes" is more realistic.<br />Anyway, the crowd likes it.
4602348 4605684 Look at the Italian Stallion!<br />Cool and relaxed.
4605726 4609521 Rocky's an off-the-board underdog<br />and they don't care at all.
4609563 4613692 This is about his pride<br />and dignity and his punch, guys.
4613734 4616361 The last thing to go is a guy's punch.
4616404 4619864 Rocky always has that puncher's chance.
4624036 4628248 Rocky Balboa is still,<br />as you can hear, the people's champion.
4628374 4632752 Prediction - for two rounds,<br />Dixon's gonna have his hands full.
4632878 4637924 Two whole rounds?<br />We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.
4638050 4641553 - How you doin'?<br />- The crowd wants to see something real.
4641595 4646433 Jim, Rocky Balboa just asked me how<br />I'm doing. Now, I grew up watching this guy.
4646559 4649227 I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights.
4649270 4651938 This is unbelievable.<br />I'm a fan. I can't help it.
4652064 4654858 Now here comes Mason Dixon.
4689060 4691644 Dixon establishing<br />his presence in the ring,
4691771 4695440 and suddenly now a conversation<br />breaking out at the ringside.
4695524 4698276 Mike Tyson calling out<br />Mason "The Line" Dixon.
4698319 4703782 - You can't call the shots. I'm the champ.<br />- You're not doin' nothin'. This is charity!
4703824 4708787 And you got that...<br />you got that midget with you right there.
4711457 4713208 Ladies and gentlemen,
4713292 4716127 welcome to the Mandalay Bay Resort
4716170 4719130 and Casino of Las Vegas,
4719215 4722801 and a special main event of the evening,
4722885 4726137 ten rounds of heavyweight excitement
4726180 4728932 sanctioned by<br />the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
4728974 4734479 And when the bell rings, the referee<br />in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
4734522 4737816 And now, for the thousands in attendance
4737942 4741694 and the millions watching around the world,
4741821 4743863 ladies and gentlemen,
4743948 4749494 let's get ready to rumble!
4751831 4756584 Introducing first, fighting out of<br />the blue corner, wearing black with gold,
4756669 4759963 official weight 217lb.
4760005 4762882 His professional record: 57 victories,
4763008 4767929 including 54 knockouts,<br />with 23 defeats and one draw.
4768013 4771349 He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,
4771475 4775895 the two-time heavyweight<br />champion of the world,
4776021 4778189 "The Italian Stallion"
4778232 4783194 Rocky
4783237 4785405 Balboa!
4788284 4791035 I hope he gets his head busted.
4792079 4794038 Shut up.
4796792 4801212 Across the ring, fighting out of the red corner,<br />wearing white with blue,
4801338 4803715 official weight 221 Ib.
4803841 4806050 He has a perfect professional record,
4806177 4812265 consisting of 33 bouts, 33 victories,<br />including 30 knockouts.
4812391 4817604 Originally from Tampa, Florida,<br />but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,
4817730 4822108 the reigning, undisputed, undefeated
4822234 4825236 heavyweight champion of the world
4825321 4833161 Mason "The Line" Dixon!
4837124 4838917 All right, gentlemen.
4839001 4842420 All right, Mason, Rocky. We went over<br />the rules in the dressing room.
4842505 4844088 I expect a good, clean fight.
4844173 4848593 Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,<br />those low blows. Be careful with those.
4848719 4852597 Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.<br />Remember, I'm fair but I'm firm.
4852723 4854599 - Touch 'em up.<br />- Enjoy the ride.
4854725 4857727 The champ is not in the best shape<br />we've seen him in.
4857811 4860104 Maybe he just plans to phone this one in.
4860189 4862607 - That wouldn't be a surprise.<br />- Love you.
4862691 4865485 One thing about Rocky<br />we know for sure,
4865611 4868112 this guy's showing up in shape.
4868155 4871282 - The old man's crazy.<br />- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
4871408 4874619 You just take it easy.<br />This is an exhibition. Do it to him.
4874662 4876246 Three rounds to set a pace.
4876288 4878623 - Every time you hit him, make a dent.<br />- Got it.
4878749 4883545 The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight?<br />I can't believe it's here.
4884797 4889968 Round one begins. If old George Foreman<br />shocked the world with one punch
4890094 4892220 why can't old Rocky Balboa?
4892304 4894931 As much excitement<br />as there is in the arena,
4894974 4897267 there's a sense of foreboding as well.
4901605 4905233 And now Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />goes to work with his jab,
4905317 4909279 as though he's fighting the number one<br />challenger in the heavyweight division.
4909321 4911656 This is to be expected early on.
4911782 4917954 You knew the champ was gonna control the<br />distance with his jab, his height, his range.
4917997 4921249 Balboa, looking to get in a shot,<br />misses wildly!
4921333 4923626 Did you like that?
4923669 4927005 It looks like a speed bag<br />against a punching bag.
4927131 4931050 Rocky's frustrated - he came<br />out of retirement to get into a fight.
4931176 4935805 Guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed<br />with. One punch could turn it around.
4935848 4939392 Apparently he forgot<br />his arthritis meds this morning.
4939518 4941227 Rocky misses!
4941353 4945023 There's a meat-seeking missile<br />on the point of the chin by the champ.
4945065 4947900 More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.
4948027 4951195 There's a hard right hand,<br />a left and a right by Balboa.
4951322 4954741 He drives Dixon into the ropes<br />with a series of shots.
4954867 4957201 And the crowd goes berserk.
4961832 4967211 Dixon punishing Balboa<br />for the temerity of landing those shots.
4969632 4975219 It's toe-to-toe in the corner,<br />Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
4981060 4985730 Balboa landing potent combinations to the<br />champion's head. A wake-up call for Dixon.
4985856 4987273 - You all right?<br />- Yeah.
4987399 4988983 - Sit down.<br />- Bricks in his glove.
4989068 4991736 - What happened to the angry stuff?<br />- It's still there.
4991862 4994572 Yeah, well, he came to battle, OK?<br />Listen to me.
4994615 4997784 If there's any bone in your body<br />he can break, he'll do it.
4997910 4999577 Give the man a little respect.
4999703 5002622 Compubox numbers<br />tell the grisly story here.
5002748 5006042 Balboa landed nine of 13 punches<br />in that round.
5006085 5011214 Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.
5011256 5012423 Listen to me.
5012466 5015051 Rocky's been here<br />a million times before -
5015094 5019430 coming out to start another round<br />after he took a beating in the previous one.
5019473 5021599 I warned him. I warned him.
5022643 5027522 Well, he's tired.<br />His legs are going fast or already gone.
5027606 5032360 And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it!
5032444 5036948 The boxing commission, which, remember,<br />was criticised for licensing him,
5037032 5041452 would be massacred<br />if something happened to Rocky.
5045124 5047125 A monstrous straight left hand!
5047209 5050461 Down goes Rocky,<br />and that could be the end of the fight.
5050546 5054382 That could be the exhibition right there.<br />But no, Balboa up,
5054466 5058845 as referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue and Rocky says yes.
5058971 5061889 Even Balboa can be too brave<br />for his own good.
5061974 5065935 Dixon comes right back to try to finish it.<br />Balboa almost went down.
5065978 5067979 Rocky shoves Dixon back.
5068105 5070481 As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
5070524 5071816 Cover up!
5071859 5076279 Open shots at close range,<br />right and left hands, and down goes Balboa,
5076321 5079449 perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career.
5079491 5083035 - That should do it.<br />- Three! Four! Five!
5083162 5084495 Six! Seven!
5084538 5087665 - Get up! Get up!<br />- Eight!
5087791 5091002 Nine!<br />How do you feel? You OK?
5091086 5095965 Now Rocky, furious with himself,<br />convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.
5096008 5099927 Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,<br />Rocky saying he's fine.
5100012 5102972 - He wants to go on.<br />- Let it go! Let it go!
5103015 5106350 And Balboa comes back<br />with a left and a right,
5106393 5110521 and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row.
5111899 5115610 Back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots.<br />Dixon hurt his hand!
5115694 5118404 - Go after him!<br />- This is Rocky's chance.
5118530 5121032 The champ just hurt his hand on Rocky's hip.
5121074 5124744 Balboa immediately going to work<br />to the body. Huge right hook.
5124870 5127705 Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body.
5127831 5130208 These are big punches.
5133796 5135004 Yes!
5137382 5141886 Rocky Balboa has knocked<br />the reigning heavyweight champion down!
5141929 5143262 You hurt him!
5143388 5148518 Mason Dixon has never taken<br />this kind of punishment in his entire career.
5148560 5152688 Maybe he's clearing his head,<br />but the body shots really caved in his ribs.
5152731 5155733 Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
5155734 5159153 Another counter hook by Balboa.<br />Followed by two more!
5159238 5162240 Dixon fires back his own hooks.<br />Rocky's stunned.
5162282 5164617 It's an all-out war along the ropes,
5164743 5170331 as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring.
5170415 5172083 Incredible.
5172167 5174085 Yeah, all right!
5174169 5176921 Welcome to Rockyland.
5179925 5182927 - How's the hand?<br />- My hand's broken.
5184471 5186639 If we lose, it's your ass. Your ass!
5186765 5189559 It'll numb up on you.<br />It'll numb up in three rounds.
5189601 5192937 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon's gonna be able to throw it hard.
5192980 5197275 - Until then, here's Rocky's chance.<br />- Take it to him! No reverse!
5197359 5199151 Take the pain, champ.
5199278 5203114 Everybody thought this was a joke,<br />including me. Now nobody's laughing!
5203240 5205616 You go get him! Go out strong!
5218630 5220631 Keep him off you.
5223343 5225303 That's it! That's it!
5238901 5241652 You won that round.<br />Break him down.
5246491 5248659 Bomb him! Bomb him!
5254499 5257001 Yeah!
5259338 5262089 Just keep throwin' them bombs.
5273435 5274518 Come on.
5282194 5284195 You can do this.
5285280 5287365 Rocky! Rocky!
5296458 5298376 Get him! Go!
5355934 5358269 Go through him.<br />Run over him.
5373243 5375161 Unload on him!
5376288 5378456 Dig down, Mason!
5389176 5393387 - They're leaving nothing on the table.<br />- The fans are standing.
5393472 5395848 They may not be able to sit down for a week.
5395974 5398851 - You're doin' great.<br />- I'm doin' better than I thought.
5398977 5402813 - Are you sure he's OK?<br />- I've had worse.
5402939 5406776 Toe-to-toe, one round to go.<br />Who would have believed this was possible?
5406818 5409779 - Can you see outta that eye?<br />- Let me talk. Look at me.
5409821 5414909 Don't take any more chances out there than<br />you have to. There's nothing more to prove.
5414993 5418871 - I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.<br />- You can do it, Rocko!
5418997 5421457 - One more round, we go home.<br />- OK, then do it.
5421500 5427254 There's a saying that every great champion<br />has one great fight left in him,
5427339 5430591 and Rocky is proving it so far.
5430675 5435721 - Come on. Touch 'em up.<br />- The last round of your life! The last round!
5435806 5438849 Come on. Touch 'em up.<br />Let's go. Touch 'em up.
5438975 5442311 - You're one crazy old man.<br />- You'll get there.
5442354 5443354 Let's go.
5443980 5448484 Tenth round of a scheduled ten.<br />Who would have dreamed that Rocky Balboa
5448527 5453489 would still be in this "exhibition" against<br />the heavyweight champion of the world?
5453532 5454907 You can do it! Come on!
5454991 5460287 This fight is as though Dixon<br />got on-the-job training in courage.
5460372 5463290 - Cover up!<br />- They're both in a pain-free zone.
5463375 5466210 These guys are fighting<br />in another dimension now.
5466294 5471048 Beyond belief! Balboa just walking<br />straight into Dixon's punches.
5471174 5474051 Target practice for Dixon.
5477055 5480683 They're exchanging right hooks.<br />Here comes Dixon!
5480725 5484061 He's exhausted from punching the man.
5484729 5486730 Knock this bum out, Mace!
5498869 5502913 What is it you said to the kid?<br />It ain't about how hard you hit.
5503039 5507293 It's about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep movin' forward.
5507377 5511046 How much you can take<br />and keep movin' forward.
5512090 5515092 - Get up.<br />- Let's go! Get up!
5515218 5518053 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5518096 5519096 Get up.
5522434 5524602 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5540952 5545497 Another monster body shot.<br />Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.
5545624 5549126 - Start movin' those hands!<br />- Less than two minutes to go.
5549252 5551670 The crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.
5551796 5554673 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Turn it over! All the way through!
5554799 5557301 .. and retaliates with fury!
5559763 5562139 Chop him down!
5564643 5566477 Come on, Rocky! Come on!
5568772 5570481 Take him out now!
5571775 5573817 They're trading shots again.
5573902 5578280 Balboa's trying to hit<br />anything and anywhere!
5579616 5581116 Win it! Win it!
5589584 5590459 Yes!
5600387 5603347 - You're a great champion. You got heart.<br />- Thanks.
5603390 5607184 Thanks for the opportunity.<br />Good man.
5608353 5613357 That was unbelievable.<br />That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
5613483 5616318 That's the kind of pride<br />you're talking about.
5617862 5620030 Hey, Paulie.
5620073 5622866 The beast is gone now.<br />The beast is out.
5622951 5626787 One of the most overused words in sports,<br />guys, is "incredible".
5626871 5631333 I hate to say it, this is incredible.
5632711 5634336 Let's go!
5637132 5640801 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />before we go to the score cards,
5640885 5646724 a round of applause<br />for these two heavyweight warriors.
5651563 5655190 We have a split decision.
5658069 5664074 Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94 Dixon.
5666244 5671874 Chuck Giampa has it 95-94 Balboa.
5679966 5685095 And Bill Graham scores it 95-94
5685221 5687765 for the winner by split decision,
5687891 5690351 and still undefeated,
5690435 5693354 the heavyweight champion of the world
5693438 5699777 Mason "The Line" Dixon!
5756334 5760462 You know I couldn't have done nothin'<br />without you.
5761673 5763924 Yo, Adrian, we did it.
5771349 5773350 We did it.
