105505 109342 COMMENTATOR 1: Yet another quick knockout for Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.
109409 111177 The fans let him know how they feel about it.
111244 114347 COMMENTATOR: 2: Hide the women and children. This could get ugly.
114414 119085 COMMENTATOR 1: This crowd does nothing to hide its anger over this latest debacle.
119152 122122 The fans are mad as hell. They don't want to take it any more.
122188 125458 They seem to be blaming Dixon, a good fighter, for the decline,
125525 127293 not only of the heavyweight division boxers,
127360 129329 but of the entire sport.
129395 133266 COMMENTATOR 2: They're pelting the undefeated heavyweight champion
133333 134968 of the world with ice.
135034 137403 COMMENTATOR 1: Maybe this angry, visceral reaction
137470 139172 will pressure Dixon to fight someone
139239 141908 who can fight back, for a change. If there's somebody out there.
141975 144444 COMMENTATOR 2: All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
144511 147180 who thrills us with his passion.

316949 318651 I know, but it's the anniversary.

370503 373606 Alright. Now get outta here.
374073 375708 Thank you, sir.

382815 385451 -How you doin'? -Hey.
385518 389489 -You caught me offguard. -I know. I wanted to catch you before you got too busy.
389555 391357 Yeah, it gets busy up there.

401934 404404 I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?
404470 406339 That would be great.
406406 408040 Come by the restaurant tonight.
408107 410176 I'll have something made special for you.
410243 412445 Tonight I can't. I've got plans.
412512 414547 A few of the guys getting together...
414614 416015 Did I do somethin' wrong?
416082 417350 What do you mean?
417417 420620 Well, I don't know exactly what I mean, but...
420686 424924 I just think that when I come here, you don't feel so comfortable.
424991 426926 And I certainly don't wanna do that.
428394 430363 Well, you throw a big shadow.
430430 434066 -A big shadow? -You're not gonna get anything done down here, Robert.
434133 436235 Well, if you won't introduce me, I will.
436302 438137 -Hi, I'm William Tomilson. -How you doin'?
438204 440506 Your son has the misfortune of working for me.
440573 442275 It's a good job.
442341 445611 I've told Robert about twenty times that I wanted to meet you.
445678 447013 But I guess you're pretty busy,
447079 449081 which isn't a bad thing, is it?
449148 450483 -I get a little tied up... -Grab a shot, will you, please?
450550 451984 I may not get this chance again.
452051 454253 Us old warhorses have to stick together, don't we?
454320 456923 -The old horses, yeah. -Ooh!
456989 458658 It's a good thing it's not your left.
458724 460593 This makes you very popular with people.
460660 462094 One, two, three.
462161 464764 Finally, we meet. Well, I have to go.
464831 466699 It was nice to meet you face to face.
466766 470269 Take care of yourself. Robert, I'll see you later.
471571 473406 (SIGHING)
473473 476008 I gotta get going. Um... I'll change my plans for tonight.
476075 478311 That would be great. I'm lookin' forward to it.
478377 479979 -How you doin'? -Okay.
480046 481113 Okay.

570202 571904 He's okay.
571971 573973 Just because you fought him, it don't mean you gotta feed him forever.
574040 575508 He doesn't even look like a fighter.
575575 577543 Oh, Spider Rico could hit.
577610 579378 Uh, how's your stomach?
579445 580813 Uh, okay.

617216 620720 And then I went in there like an animal and threw him into the corner
620786 622655 and I unloaded everything I had,
622722 624390 hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
624457 627226 But Creed kept bustin' me back pretty good,
627293 629328 and the agony began to pile up.

1248914 1251817 What are you doing? Don't get out. It's alright!
1254653 1257556 No, Little Marie. It ain't alright.
1260425 1261627 (DOOR SLAMS SHUT)
1262494 1264496 -Yo! -MAN: What?
1264563 1267766 I'll tell you what. You get inside.
1271169 1272371 You see that? You see that?
1272437 1273805 MAN: Yeah. Alright.
1273872 1274906 What do you say?
1274973 1276108 I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
1276174 1277442 ROCKY: Get a job!
1285384 1286585 (SIGHS)
1290989 1291990 (ENGINE STARTING)
1293792 1295861 That guy sends his apologies.
1297029 1298330 Okay.
1315147 1319551 Martin! Yo, Martin!
1324389 1325991 I see you still got your key.
1326058 1328827 Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?
1328894 1331730 I got a lotta time since your people let me go.
1331797 1334232 You know I had nothin' to do with that.
1334299 1335600 Yeah.
1337502 1339871 We moved in about a year ago.
1340439 1341973 It's only temporary.
1342040 1343342 I could see that.
1343408 1345177 I'm gonna look for an apartment.
1345243 1347079 Apartments are nice.
1347145 1348847 It is what it is.
1348914 1350716 It is what it is.
1350782 1352617 But this place used to be pretty nice.
1352684 1354453 There's a lot of history around here.
1354519 1355887 Yeah.
1355954 1357689 Down the street is the Cambria Fight Club.
1357756 1359791 They used to call it the Bucket of Blood.
1359858 1361426 I took some massive beatings there.
1361493 1362994 But it was nice. Good memories.
1363061 1368533 And I heard these buildings are 100, 150 years old...
1368600 1371236 If I was 150 years old, I'd be fallin' apart, too.
1371303 1373405 So it's okay, building.
1373472 1374806 Does that light work?
1374873 1377576 Nah, it's burnt out or somethin'.
1380212 1384216 Listen, thanks for the ride and, uh, I'm sorry about those guys.
1384282 1386785 Some of those guys just got their brains on
1386852 1388353 -backwards and stuff. -(BASKETBALL BOUNCING)
1388420 1389988 What's he doing out so late?
1390055 1391123 Is that your kid?
1391189 1393525 Yeah. Wish he wouldn't stay out so late.
1393592 1395127 Amazing.
1395193 1396595 What's that?
1396661 1399097 Last time I seen you, you was a kid,
1399164 1401566 and now you officially got one of your own.
1401633 1407506 It's amazing. You know, he resembles you. He's got that big Irish hair.
1408240 1409708 It's the other one.
1412811 1413645 Yeah?
1413712 1415447 His father was from Jamaica.
1415514 1416982 Jamaica? European...
1419751 1421753 Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?
1422454 1423688 Not really.
1423755 1425624 -What's his name? -Steps.
1426725 1428059 Short for Stevenson.
1428126 1429461 Makes sense.
1432397 1436268 Does he look mad at me, or is it maybe the angle I'm standin' at?
1436334 1438603 -No. He's a good kid. -Oh.
1438670 1440238 You wanna meet him?
1440305 1444009 You know, it's getting kinda late. I got so much to do.
1444075 1445410 I understand.
1445477 1449247 Uh... Thanks again for the ride and, um, everything else.
1451750 1453518 I'll see you.
1454553 1456154 You, too.
1456221 1460292 Steps! Let's go! Say goodnight to your friend.
1460358 1462594 -What are you doing out in the cold with no hat on? -Huh?
1462661 1463995 Did you get something to eat?
1470469 1472170 Yo, Little Marie!
1473672 1476107 Ain't you gonna introduce me to your kid?
1476174 1477375 How you doin', Steps?
1477442 1478643 Whassup?
1478710 1480545 Listen, I have this restaurant,
1480612 1483615 nice little eatery not too far from here.
1485517 1489554 Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo, all the stuff in my pocket.
1489621 1491723 Here you go. I've got a card, there it is.
1491790 1494192 And if you ever get a chance, it'd be great
1494259 1496728 if both of you came down there to eat.
1496795 1502167 It'd be great, free... Anyway, I'll leave it over there under... Here.
1504102 1506972 I'll leave it on the steps. Steps...
1508240 1509241 (CHUCKLES)
1511309 1512911 See you later.
1515080 1516815 Come on, let's go.
1519417 1520986 MARTIN: You've known what was best for you since
1521052 1523588 you were ten and walked in here alone.
1524789 1528660 Got everything money can buy, except what it can't.
1530195 1534566 It's pride. Pride is what got your ass outta here.
1535700 1539271 Losing is what brought you back.
1539337 1544009 People like you, they need to be tested. Need a challenge.
1544075 1545410 You know that ain't gonna happen.
1545477 1546845 Ain't nothin' out there, Martin.
1546912 1550682 There's always somebody out there. Always.
1550749 1553151 When that time comes and something's
1553218 1555787 standin' in front of you that ain't runnin',
1555854 1558256 that ain't backing up, and is hittin' on you,
1558323 1561593 and you're too damn tired to breathe...
1561660 1564596 You find that situation on you, that's good.
1564663 1567232 Because that's baptism under fire.
1569034 1570735 You get through that, you find the only kind
1570802 1573338 of respect that matters in this damn world,
1574272 1575874 self-respect.
1578877 1581313 Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.
1581379 1583448 Now what can the champ do for you?
1584482 1586217 You can give me some of that money you got.
1586284 1587319 (LAUGHS)
1587385 1588386 (LAUGHS)
1588453 1589688 You know, I like you, Martin.

1592924 1594125 (BOTH LAUGHING)
1598163 1600365 How about a picture with the kid, Rock? Is that alright?
1600432 1601733 Sure.
1603702 1607138 Here, son, hold up your fist. Makes you look more hazardous.
1609140 1610642 -There you go. -Thanks, Rock.
1610709 1613111 Enjoy your meal.
1613178 1614779 -He's a nice guy, isn't he? -ISABEL: Rocky?
1615347 1617182 Yeah.
1617248 1618950 Spider just went downstairs. I don't know if that's alright, so...
1619017 1620185 What's he doin' down there?
1620251 1622988 I don't know. That's your friend.

1630161 1632497 Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
1632564 1633698 Oh, come on. You're my guest.
1633765 1634866 Let me do something.
1634933 1636434 Keep eating. Guests do that.
1636501 1639070 Don't make me fight you again. Last time you got lucky.
1639671 1642007 Lucky? Okay.
1642073 1643408 Jesus wants me to work.
1644042 1645477 ISABEL: Yo, Rocky.
1645543 1646578 Yeah?
1646645 1647879 You've got guests.
1650582 1653151 Don't get too wet, okay?
1653218 1655353 Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
1661326 1662827 You kept the card.
1663662 1665530 Yeah, I kept the card.
1665597 1666698 Why don't you sit down.
1666765 1667832 Sure.

1681913 1683848 BRIAN KENNY: Tonight boxing once again.
1683915 1686518 Two contrasting styles in almost every way.
1686584 1688253 -Welcome once again... -Hey, can you turn this up?
1688319 1690188 ...to ESPN's Then Versus Now.
1690255 1692257 Who was the best of all time?
1692323 1694125 If two athletes from different eras
1694192 1695994 could actually compete against one another,
1696061 1697395 who would come out on top?
1697462 1698930 Given the same rules, using the same
1698997 1701199 equipment, who was the greatest?
1701266 1703334 This week, we feed our facts into the computer.
1703401 1705770 They will weigh in on who they think will reign supreme
1705837 1709474 while fielding the comments of our illustrious panel of sportswriters.
1709541 1711509 (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
1714946 1718817 Champ! Yo, champ!
1718883 1720752 Yeah?
1720819 1722554 Come check out this trash they're talking about you, man!
1722620 1723688 What are you talking about?
1723755 1726024 Come check this out! Hurry up!
1726091 1728026 KENNY: Tonight, the former two-time heavyweight
1728093 1730562 champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.
1730628 1732530 Alright, Chuck Johnson, USA Today?
1732597 1735233 No question, Rocky Balboa fought tougher
1735300 1737702 fights during a tougher era in boxing.
1737769 1741906 Mason Dixon in his career has basically been spoon-fed his opponents.
1741973 1743374 No question in my mind. Not only does
1743441 1745777 Rocky win, but he wins by a knockout.
1745844 1747045 (ALL CHEERING)
1750715 1752383 Offspring!
1752450 1754519 KENNY: Bernie Hernandez, what do you think?
1754586 1757055 Dixon is a victim of his own dominance. He's never been in
1757122 1759157 real knockdown, drag-out brawls.
1759224 1761326 He's never had to dig down to rally back.
1761392 1763595 If he tries to dig down against Balboa,
1763661 1766097 he'll find he doesn't have a big enough shovel.
1766164 1767866 I clearly give it to Balboa.
1768466 1769567 (CHEERING)
1769634 1771469 MAN: What happened to you, man?
1771536 1773404 What happened to you?
1773471 1775740 KENNY: And Burt Randolph Sugar...
1775807 1778476 Dixon has fought creampuffs. So we really don't know what he's made of.
1778543 1780612 But both in their primes, you have
1780678 1782747 to factor in Dixon's unbelievable speed
1782814 1785850 his slashing offense. He cuts Balboa to bits.
1785917 1789020 No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.
1790121 1792056 BRIAN KENNY: Here's where our subjectivity ends.
1792123 1795126 -Let's see what the computer has to say. -(BELL RINGS)
1795193 1797128 COMMENTATOR 1: Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has
1797195 1799330 no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.
1810508 1811509 (CHEERING)
1815580 1819951 Now Dixon is done. He is reeling. He is almost out on his feet!
1820018 1823121 Balboa turning up the heat! Hounds him across the rink.
1823188 1826291 He's bitten off more than he can chew this time. Believe it.
1826357 1831062 A murderous right hook! And Dixon is out on his feet!
1831129 1833798 He is out cold as he crumbles to the canvas!
1833865 1838002 And it is Balboa who has won the event! Beat the odds.
1839270 1842407 Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky!

1848947 1850481 I'm glad you liked the food.

1854552 1856287 Thanks, man.

1878810 1882947 It's good makin' your own G's. My kid stashed a few bucks doing that.
1883014 1885783 Why are you bein' so nice?
1885850 1888720 I don't want you to think nothin's off, you know.

1891489 1893791 I wasn't thinkin' that. Believe me.
1893858 1896494 No? Then what were you thinkin'?
1896561 1899530 That you don't owe us nothin'. What are you doin'?
1899597 1902200 Ah, be patient. Now...
1903368 1907405 I don't owe you nothin', but why do you have to

1928860 1929861 What do you think?
1929928 1932230 I think that would be nice.
1933031 1936200 Good. That's very nice.

1970034 1974772 a large variety of dogs. I used to come here a lot for sightseein'.
1974839 1980111 You learn a lot talkin' to dogs. Really, you do.
1980178 1984215 Yeah. Hey, how about this one?
1987285 1988686 He don't look too friendly, my friend.
1988753 1991489 Man, this is the one. Hey, boy, how you doin'?
1991556 1994392 Hey, what about this one here? Come here, boy.
1994459 1996160 -STEPS: Who, him? -Why not?
1996227 1998896 Hell, no. That's one ugly dog.
1998963 2000598 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.
2000665 2003067 If you look at it closely, the color,
2003134 2007271 it looks like old furniture, like some kinda pirate chest thing going on.
2007338 2009707 Yeah, sure. Hey, how about a young one?
2009774 2013244 Steps, forget him. Come here. I want you to see something.
2013311 2017915 Notice what this animal is doin' here? Lyin' in that position?
2017982 2019417 He ain't doin' nothin'.
2019484 2022086 No, he's doin' a lot. He ain't wastin' no energy.
2022153 2023554 Because he's dead.
2029794 2032964 He ain't dead. There's a lot of good mileage left on that animal.
2033031 2037168 Some good food, a couple of new friends, bingo, he's back.
2037235 2038770 What do you think is a good name?
2038836 2040538 It's your dog. You name him.
2040605 2043307 No. It's a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
2043374 2046110 Look, I don't know much about no dogs.
2046177 2048246 Well, you know, it ain't that complicated.
2048312 2053217 You pet him, you feed him and nature takes its course.
2053284 2054952 Don't you wanna name an animal?
2055019 2058790 Every guy should at one time try to name an animal something.
2059290 2061492 I don't know. Fleabag?
2061559 2065730 It's catchy. It ain't original, but it's pretty good. Uh...
2065797 2068166 I think, though, you could come up with, in your young brain,
2068232 2071169 something better to throw out than Fleabag.
2072103 2074138 Punchy. How's that?
2075373 2077408 -Punchy? -Yeah, Punchy.

2085516 2088820 It's easy to remember, it's not that hard to spell
2088886 2091255 and once it's in your brain, you never forget it.
2091322 2092623 Punchy. Very good.
2092690 2093724 Alright.
2093791 2095560 Good call.

2183548 2186284 I'm gonna take off, alright? Hey, that stuff back there is pretty cool.
2186350 2187952 -You like that? -Yeah.
2188019 2189320 Thanks. I appreciate it.
2189387 2191489 -I'm gonna catch you later. -Alright.
2196527 2197929 Who's the criminal?
2197995 2199130 He's a nice kid.
2199197 2200865 He dresses like a bum.
2200932 2203668 Oh! Coming from a human hamper, that's quite a compliment.
2205036 2207104 Hide the silverware.
2207171 2208673 That's nice.
2210675 2211776 Hey, Spider.
2216214 2218282 Didn't you knock out that bum once?
2219083 2220952 Will you give it a rest?
2224121 2225256 (TV TURNS ON)
2225323 2226891 (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING FROM TV)
2231095 2234899 I'm gonna be late for work for this. Gimme a break, huh?
2234966 2238069 Alright. Just for a few seconds.
2238135 2239737 In the late sixties, a simulated fight
2239804 2242006 took place between two legends,
2242073 2245576 Muhammed Ali and Rocky Marciano. Marciano long retired
2245643 2248012 and Ali, unable to fight legitimately for
2248079 2249814 three years for having refused induction
2249880 2251949 into the armed forces, was in need of money,
2252016 2253951 and agreed to the so-called dream match,
2254018 2256787 whose outcome would be decided by a computer.
2256854 2258956 It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano
2259023 2261726 won the much-disputed computer decision
2261792 2264495 and guess what? Not much has changed.
2264562 2266631 MALE COMMENTATOR: Last week, Rocky Balboa won
2266697 2268566 a decisive fight against heavyweight champion Mason Dixon.
2268633 2271569 See? That's the cartoon fight I'm telling you about!
2271636 2273938 MALE FIGHT COMMENTATOR: A stunning knockout. And keep in mind
2274005 2276140 this is taking the human factor out of it.
2276207 2278309 -The computer says Rocky Balboa... -That was beautiful.
2278376 2279944 ...would be triumphant.
2280011 2283180 K.O. thirteen, and here is some of the fallout.
2283247 2285683 What started as a simple form of entertainment
2285750 2287451 has now become this rallying cry
2287518 2289086 for people who think an old-school athlete
2289153 2290988 like Balboa could actually be better.
2291055 2292857 So your computer technology has to create
2292923 2295126 what isn't. That's just not responsible.
2295192 2297295 Get therapy, will you?
2297361 2299530 Skip, how do you think Balboa would have done against Dixon?
2299597 2302667 Badly. Personally, I think Balboa was completely overrated.
2302733 2305136 MALE ESPN ANCHOR 1: You know, he owns a little restaurant in South Philly.
2305202 2307571 SKIP: What's the specialty, Pounded Chicken?
2307638 2310708 Anyway, I would have paid to see the fight. Next topic, NASCAR,
2310775 2312910 and the controversy that won't go away.
2312977 2315479 Let's go back to Sunday's race...
2315546 2320518 Hey, cheer up. It's free advertisement. Come on. Meathouse calls.
2331228 2332730 ROCKY: Yo, Robert!
2335533 2337034 What is this? What are you doing out so late?
2337101 2339570 Uh, I tried callin', but nothin' was pickin' up.
2339637 2341138 Is something wrong?
2341205 2343341 No. I just wanted to come by and see you in person.
2343407 2344775 You wanna come inside?
2344842 2347411 No. I just wanna get your opinion on somethin'.
2347912 2349513 Sure. On what?
2349580 2351916 They say you only go around once, right?
2351982 2353351 I've heard that.
2353417 2356420 Well, I think I wanna do somethin'.
2356821 2357955 Like what?
2358022 2359056 Fight.
2360758 2363728 Nothing big. Small stuff, like locally...
2366497 2369667 Don't you think you're too, you know, old?
2369734 2371769 Think you should stop tryin' things
2371836 2374038 'cause you had a few too many birthdays? I do not.
2374105 2375806 People are gonna think you're going crazy.
2375873 2380311 What's crazy about standing toe-to-toe saying "I am"?
2380378 2382947 That's just the ego talking.
2383013 2386884 What are you trying to prove to other people, Pop?
2386951 2389887 Prove? Listen, I stopped thinkin' the way
2389954 2391789 other people think a long time ago.
2391856 2393691 You gotta think like you think.
2395359 2396560 I do.
2396627 2398963 Do you? Good.
2399029 2403968 You gotta face reality. It's a different world now.
2404802 2406971 Only the clothes are different.
2409173 2412777 I really don't know what you want from me.
2412843 2416814 I just want us to get involved. You know, like, home team.
2418849 2420217 (SIGHS)
2420284 2425022 Look, whatever it is you're going through, it will pass.
2425523 2427024 You're probably right.
2427091 2430161 Time is gonna catch up to all of us.
2430227 2431662 Especially if you're standin' still.
2431729 2433130 Hey, come on...
2435833 2437468 Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.
2441806 2442873 PAULIE: Did you tell this to your kid?
2442940 2444809 ROCKY: Yeah, I did.
2444875 2447178 -And he thinks you're nuts, right? -Yeah.
2447244 2452483 Oh! He don't believe in you? Welcome to my world, buddy.
2452550 2455820 Rocko, nobody's givin' you no title shot.
2455886 2458122 I know that. I don't want one.
2458189 2460858 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
2462026 2463627 No.
2463694 2466764 You're mad because they took down your statue?
2467064 2468399 No...
2468466 2470034 (LAUGHING)
2470100 2471335 Not really.
2471402 2474405 If it's about money, just hang a sign
2474472 2477074 around your neck saying "Punch me".
2477141 2478876 Five dollars, you'll make big money.
2478943 2479944 (LAUGHING)
2481579 2483981 What? You haven't peaked yet?
2484315 2485716 Peaked?
2486083 2487585 Yeah, peaked.
2487651 2490287 I don't know. There's still some stuff in the basement.
2490721 2492323 What basement?
2492389 2493791 In here.
2494859 2496627 Tell me about the stuff.
2497795 2499096 What about it?
2499163 2502533 Tell me about the stuff inside. Is it angry?
2503100 2504468 Angry?
2504535 2506203 Are you mad because Adrian left you?
2506270 2508973 She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
2509039 2510941 Okay. Okay.
2511475 2513644 (SNIFFLES)
2515179 2519383 You know, sometimes it's hard to breathe.
2519450 2522086 I feel this beast inside me.
2523521 2526223 It's okay, Rocko. It's okay.
2526290 2528893 Is it okay?
2534899 2538502 I just never knew it was supposed to be this hard.
2538569 2541639 It wasn't supposed to be like this. You know it.
2543240 2545042 (SIGHS)
2551582 2553684 You wanna come by and help me train?
2553751 2555553 I got a job here.
2555619 2557821 I understand.
2557888 2560457 Remember you said if you stay one place long enough
2560524 2562059 you become that place?
2562927 2564962 This is all I've got.
2565663 2567364 I understand.
2571035 2572636 (EXHALES)
2572703 2576840 If you get time and come down and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
2577741 2579209 Of course.
2582813 2584615 Bye, Paulie.
2585149 2586750 Goodbye, Rocko.
2589486 2590955 Take care.
2596694 2598996 MALE COMMISSIONER 1: This plenary session of the Pennsylvania
2599063 2601565 Athletic Commission is convened
2601632 2606203 in order to consider the application of Rocky Balboa
2606270 2610608 for the issuance of a discretionary professional boxing license
2610674 2615646 due to his ineligibility to be licensed as a matter of right.
2615713 2617648 Mr. Balboa, you are welcome here.
2617715 2619483 Since you're representing yourself,
2619550 2623020 we invite you to make an opening statement, if you'd like to.
2623087 2625856 I was just curious about how I did, that's all.
2625923 2630294 Alright, well. The Medical Advisory Board has informed us
2630361 2633330 that the battery of tests to which you've been subjected,
2633397 2637034 you've passed these tests with flying colors.
2637101 2639670 And we congratulate you for that.
2639737 2641305 -Thanks. -However,
2641372 2643907 this commission, in good conscience,
2643974 2647077 cannot recommend you for a license,
2647144 2650080 and we therefore deny your application.
2651849 2653484 Didn't I do what you asked?
2653550 2654818 Yes, you did.
2654885 2656620 So I should get a license, right?
2656687 2658022 Not exactly.
2660658 2664628 So why did you give me all them tests if you was never passing me?
2664695 2667231 We've got to stand by our decision and
2667297 2670167 deny your request for a license at this time.
2682479 2684848 Don't I got some rights?
2684915 2687317 MALE COMMISSIONER 1: What rights do you think you're referring to?
2687384 2688752 Rights, like in that official paper
2688819 2689953 they wrote down the street there?
2690020 2691588 That's the Bill of Rights.
2691655 2693457 Yeah, the Bill of Rights.
2693524 2695559 Don't it say somethin' about goin' after what makes you happy?
2695626 2697728 No, that's "the pursuit of happiness". But what is your point?
2697795 2698996 My point is I'm pursuing something,
2699063 2701131 and nobody looks too happy about it.
2701198 2703333 But we're just looking after your interests.
2703400 2705002 I appreciate that, but maybe you're looking
2705069 2707705 out for your interests a little bit more.
2707771 2709406 You shouldn't be asking people
2709473 2711442 to come down here and pay the freight on something.
2711508 2714378 They pay. They still ain't good enough. You think that's right?
2714445 2716013 Maybe you're doing your job, but why
2716080 2718282 do you gotta stop me from doing mine?
2718348 2719917 Because if you're willing to go through all
2719983 2722186 the battling to get where you want to get,
2722252 2724154 who's got the right to stop you?
2724221 2726890 Maybe you have something you never finished,
2726957 2728358 something you really want to do
2728425 2730160 something you never said to somebody, something!
2730227 2732296 And you're told no, even after you pay your dues.
2732362 2735199 Who's got the right to tell you that? Nobody!
2735265 2736834 It's your right to listen to your gut.
2736900 2738635 It ain't nobody's right to say no,
2738702 2739970 after you earn the right to be what
2740037 2741772 you want to be or do what you want to do!
2746276 2747845 The older I get, the more things
2747911 2750447 I gotta leave behind. That's life.
2750514 2755052 The only thing I'm asking you to leave on the table is what's right.
2772536 2774638 Have you seen the paper today?
2774705 2777007 Front row. Front row.
2777074 2778976 That is so great.
2779910 2782513 Let's go get some food. Food...
2782579 2784214 Come on. Come on!
2786216 2788352 The last two pay-per-views were in the toilet.
2788418 2789853 Nobody cares. You're not makin'
2789920 2791722 heavyweight championship money.
2791789 2793257 There's a bunch of nobodies out there, Mace. This is the bottom line.
2793323 2795325 But I wanna talk to you about somethin'
2795392 2796827 I think is an interesting opportunity we should run with.
2796894 2798295 Look at me! You heard Rocky Balboa
2798362 2800030 applied for a license and got one?
2800097 2801865 Yeah, I heard. Forget about him...
2801932 2803200 -No, hear me out. -Hear what out?
2803267 2804768 You want me to fight a guy I can beat
2804835 2806303 with both hands tied behind my back?
2806370 2808205 Everybody knows you could beat the guy sitting down.
2808272 2810007 But that's not what it's about.
2810073 2813043 It's about makin' money. We gotta capitalize on that computer fight.
2813110 2814411 This thing could do a million buys.
2814478 2816046 That's fifteen, twenty million to you.
2816113 2817881 -Forget about it. -Then what do you wanna do?
2817948 2819416 Because no one is beating the door down to watch you fight any more.
2819483 2820984 Look, man, we've got guaranteed fights...
2821051 2822486 No, we don't. You wanna do this right now
2822553 2824621 in front of your friends, we'll do it now.
2824688 2827624 We got nothin'. All the pay-per-view fights you came up with got rejected.
2827691 2831161 You know why? They're all bums out there. Nobody cares about them.
2831228 2835799 There's no marquee value. But this Balboa thing is interesting.
2835866 2837334 -I don't wanna do it... -Listen to me.
2837401 2839269 It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.
2839336 2841238 Call it nostalgia or whatever you want,
2841305 2843373 but people can relate to that stuff.
2843440 2845342 This is a no-lose for everybody. It's all good.
2845409 2847611 -Good for who? -For you! Not for me!
2847678 2851281 Maybe you don't understand. People don't like you any more.
2851348 2853584 They don't follow you. They're not supporting you any more.
2853650 2855052 Understand?
2855118 2857020 Don't look at me like I'm messing with your legacy.
2857087 2859022 Every jock now thinks they've got a legacy.
2859089 2860757 A legacy is what you get instead
2860824 2862025 of getting paid. That's a legacy.
2862092 2863493 Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
2863560 2865062 I'm not no more.
2865128 2866363 PROMOTER: Mason. Everybody knows you could kick
2866430 2868532 this old man's ass. But you don't.
2868599 2870701 You leave him with a little bit of dignity, so they say,
2870767 2874438 "Mason Dixon's got compassion. He's a decent guy, a nice guy."
2874504 2876039 You'll get a whole new audience,
2876106 2877507 we'll double your money on the next fight.
2877574 2879309 You want a new image? That's how you get it.
2879376 2881278 What you mean? To replace the one that you two made?
2881345 2882980 -(SCOFFS) -Whoa, wait. We made your world green.
2883046 2884114 You made the rest.
2884181 2886183 You made all this junk happen.
2886250 2888118 I've had it up to here with this mess, man.
2888185 2889419 It's time for me to make some changes.
2889486 2891088 I'm goin' back to Martin's gym.
2891154 2892556 Alright, we'll talk about this crap.
2892623 2894625 I want Martin back. There's nothin' to talk about.
2905969 2907704 -How you doin'? -Hey, what a surprise.
2907771 2909740 I was just drivin' around the neighborhood and I thought,
2909806 2912809 -"Why not drive by and say hello." -You wanna come inside?
2912876 2916546 No, the dog needs some exercise. You wanna take a little walk?
2916613 2917614 Uh... Yeah. Alright.
2917681 2918782 It's nice outside.
2918849 2920417 Alright.
2920484 2921885 Nice and brisk.
2921952 2923420 When did you get a dog?
2923487 2925122 Uh... We picked up Punchy a couple of days ago.
2925188 2926657 -Punchy? -Yeah.
2926723 2928091 You named your dog Punchy?
2928158 2930093 Actually, your kid came up with the name.
2930160 2932496 Oh, yeah? I think that's disrespectful.
2932562 2937768 Oh, no. It's fine. Really. It's easy to remember and all that.
2937834 2941171 Listen, what do you think about coming over to the restaurant?
2941238 2944775 -What for? -You know, for work.
2944841 2947778 The hostess is gonna be havin' a kid. You'd do good.
2947844 2949046 I don't know...
2949112 2950714 I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
2950781 2953283 I appreciate what you're doing for my kid, but I can't.
2953350 2956086 You know, I think you'd like it a lot.
2956153 2958822 It's a nice environment, it's very pleasant...
2958889 2960524 Can we drop it?
2963060 2964661 What's bothering you?
2964728 2967197 Nothing. It's alright. Listen, I gotta get back.
2968332 2970434 -Naw, it ain't alright. -Oh, come on.
2970500 2972002 What?
2972069 2974271 I'm supposed to be the first person people see when they walk in?
2974338 2978008 You just give out menus, say "Hello, how are you", sit people down,
2978075 2980444 Look, Little Marie, if I can do it, anybody can do it.
2980510 2982012 You could find ten better people,
2982079 2984147 a hundred better people for this job.
2984214 2985916 Give it a try, like two weeks.
2985983 2987284 I don't wanna try.
2988285 2989886 Who put this stuff in your head?
2989953 2991188 Nobody.
2991254 2992656 Well, it don't get in there by itself.
2996026 2998128 Thanks for comin' by.
2999796 3004067 Yo! When was the last time you went dancing? Has it been a while?
3004134 3005802 Why are you asking me that?
3005869 3008005 I'm asking because you're dancing around all these problems,
3008071 3009339 you might as well come and dance with me.
3009406 3010807 Now, I ain't that good,
3010874 3013310 but I'm probably better than the average bear.
3013377 3014778 Where that came from, I don't know.
3016213 3017514 You're crazy.
3017581 3019316 A little bit. But the way you're thinkin'
3019383 3022452 and talkin', it's a little crazy, too.
3022519 3025989 Come on. You deserve better. Really. Come on over.
3026056 3029393 I need you to class my place up. Philly needs you.
3030761 3034364 And if you say "Screw you, creepo" again, I totally understand.
3034431 3036633 But I'm warnin' you, I'm gonna put myself
3036700 3038869 geographically in the middle of the street
3038935 3042539 and stand here, me and Punchy, and wave to the first bus, and say
3042606 3044541 "Come on over here and mash me!
3044608 3046943 "Because Little Marie turned down the job at the restaurant."
3047010 3049346 "She thinks she's better than us."
3049413 3050580 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been
3050647 3052215 a bus down here in twenty years.
3052849 3054551 -Yeah? -No.
3055752 3056753 Whew.
3056820 3059389 That was a close call.
3059456 3064127 Listen, seriously. Come on over. It would be nice.
3067197 3068598 Alright.
3086950 3088218 FOREMAN: Paulie!
3098462 3100597 (SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
3127724 3131061 How are you? Get my unusual up there.
3131128 3134164 Excuse me. Deliveries are in the back.
3134231 3136066 I'm not a delivery guy.
3136133 3138034 Do you have a reservation?
3138101 3139903 Do I look like a freakin' Indian?
3139970 3141438 (LAUGHING)
3143974 3145308 Hey, Rocky?
3148645 3150647 (SIGHS)
3150714 3153717 I think we've got a little bit of a problem with this guy.
3153783 3156520 Problem? No, he's just a relative.
3156586 3157854 Oh. Okay.
3161258 3162592 Yo, Paulie?
3164961 3166062 What happened to your eye?
3166129 3167197 I hit it.
3167264 3168865 -Why? -Needed to.
3169766 3171134 What happened?
3171201 3173370 -I'm celebrating. -Why?
3174137 3175605 I retired.
3175672 3176806 Retired?
3176873 3177874 (LAUGHS)
3182212 3186416 When did they start giving retired people meat instead of watches?
3190187 3191621 I don't need a watch.
3193557 3197294 I got a watch! You gave me a watch!
3199029 3200864 I don't need a goddamn watch.
3203033 3204100 Yo, Paulie!
3204167 3205769 I got a watch!
3207537 3209472 I got two watches!
3210140 3211641 Yo, Paulie!
3224487 3225989 Yo, Paulie...
3227224 3228959 Rock.
3229025 3230994 It takes guts climbing back in that ring,
3231061 3233396 knowing you're gonna take a beating.
3236299 3238268 You're gonna do all right.
3238335 3239603 How do you know that?
3241504 3243039 The stuff in the basement.
3243106 3244307 (LAUGHS)
3254918 3256419 Thanks, Paulie.
3265962 3267030 You okay?
3267097 3268164 Yeah. Good. How are you?
3268231 3269799 Oh. Fine. This is great.
3269866 3272836 Listen, um... Some guys over there wanna talk to you.
3272902 3274871 Okay. You got it.
3278942 3280510 Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.
3280577 3281678 No problem. Our pleasure.
3281745 3283013 You wanna hear some stories?
3283079 3285148 -PROMOTER: What kinda stories? -(CHUCKLES)
3285215 3287017 Well, a lot of people like to hear these old fight stories.
3287083 3288618 -PROMOTER: Maybe later. -Okay.
3288685 3292389 I'm Lou DiBella. This is Luco. He's Mason Dixon's manager.
3293123 3294157 Will you sit down and join us?
3294224 3295659 -Sure. -LC: Please.
3297260 3299996 You know, we have the promotional contract for Mason Dixon...
3300063 3301865 -Who's a big fan, by the way. -Really?
3301931 3303933 And when he heard you were interested in fighting again...
3304000 3306269 He thought why not try and work something out.
3306336 3309839 Like a special event. A first-class exhibition fight.
3310840 3312275 Why me?
3312342 3314411 He respects the hell outta you. Alright? And let's be honest.
3314477 3317213 That computer fight got people curious.
3317280 3318882 This could be very interesting.
3318948 3322519 I ain't interested in getting mangled and embarrassed.
3322585 3324621 That's not gonna happen. Never happen.
3324688 3327924 Truthfully, I was thinkin' more on a
3329359 3331494 miniscule, small level.
3331561 3335365 Small fights, not big fights. Small fights.
3335432 3337100 Local. You know what I mean?
3337167 3339069 Not a bad idea. But don't think of it as big.
3339135 3340904 Think of it like I said, like an exhibition.
3340970 3342806 Think of it as a glorified sparring session.
3342872 3344641 And here's something I think you'll like.
3344708 3346676 We're gonna donate a portion of the gate to charity.
3347510 3348878 That's always nice.
3348945 3350146 It's good to give.
3351681 3353383 Where's it taking place?
3353450 3355085 Las Vegas.
3355151 3357487 Nice and warm. This cold's gotta be killing you.
3358221 3359856 Bit stiff.
3359923 3361391 You move better when you're warmer, you know that?
3361458 3362992 -Yeah. -And if nothing else,
3363059 3365328 you'll have new stories to tell.
3365395 3369199 I really gotta think about this. Is that okay?
3369265 3371167 -I understand. No problem. -No problem.
3371234 3373470 I'm gonna go over there. You guys can order something.
3373536 3374804 What do you recommend?
3374871 3376740 -It's all edible. -(LAUGHS)
3378942 3380577 Okay. Thanks.
3381878 3385815 We got him. Imagine if Dixon met this bastard in his prime?
3385882 3387550 -He'd kill him. Kill him. -You ain't kiddin'.
3388752 3390687 Man, I'm confused...
3393890 3395692 (SOUL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
3398561 3400497 I didn't think this was gonna come along.
3400563 3403099 But this is what you wanted, right?
3403166 3407003 I talk and I talk, and sometimes I think what I'm saying is true
3407070 3411441 and then I look at myself and I'm not even sure what's true anymore.
3411508 3416246 I push this crazy idea about fightin'... What's it all about?
3416312 3419482 Do I really care about standin' toe-to-toe and all that stuff,
3419549 3423119 or like my kid says, is it just ego?
3423186 3424988 Or am I this old pug who's just tryin'
3425054 3427290 to replace old pain with new pain?
3427357 3429993 I don't know.
3431594 3434731 Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.
3434798 3438835 I'm always listenin' and lookin'.
3438902 3443840 But who you are, the part of you that's so full of life...
3443907 3445909 We all have that feeling, that fire,
3445975 3448211 but usually never get a chance to use it.
3448278 3450447 Then it just goes away.
3450513 3455885 But you can. You've got this opportunity, so do it. Why not?
3455952 3460290 This is who you are. This is who you'll always be.
3460356 3463827 And you don't move aside for nobody until you're ready to move.
3463893 3466763 It doesn't matter how this looks to other people.
3466830 3469065 All that matters is how it looks to you.
3471267 3472602 Rocky.
3474270 3475772 Look at me.
3477340 3481544 How it looks to you.
3481611 3483546 And if this is something that you wanna do...
3483613 3487217 And if this is something that you've gotta do, then you do it.

3538735 3542205 Warriors like Rocky Balboa. Let's open it up for questions.
3542272 3544173 (CLAMORING)
3544240 3545842 FEMALE REPORTER 1: Rocky, a few great fighters have fought in
3545909 3547744 their fifties, often with disastrous results.
3547810 3549379 Why risk the danger and embarrassment?
3549445 3552415 The smart money says you have virtually no chance.
3552482 3554751 A puncher always has a chance.
3554817 3557253 This fight will be competitive.
3557320 3559722 FEMALE REPORTER 2: Why are you doing this, Rocky?
3559789 3563793 I don't know, I'd rather do something I love badly than...
3563860 3568064 PAULIE: Than to feel bad by not doin' somethin' you love.
3569599 3572468 MALE REPORTER 1: Rocky, the press has labeled you a "Balboasaurus"...
3572535 3573736 (ALL LAUGHING)
3573803 3575438 How do you feel about that?
3575505 3577907 MALE REPORTER 2: Mason, let's say the following happens:
3577974 3580143 You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
3580209 3582145 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
3582211 3584180 -you'll be the joke of the decade. -(SCATTERED CHUCKLING)
3584247 3587150 You all know that will never happen. This is only an exhibition.
3587216 3590720 Don't go tryin' to make more out of this than that computer did. Okay?
3591287 3593256 (CLAMORING)
3593323 3595792 MALE REPORTER 3: Isn't this sport in enough trouble without these circus events?
3596593 3598428 Next question.
3598494 3599996 FEMALE REPORTER 1: On the surface this looks like a cheap
3600063 3601931 bit of ring theater between, no offense,
3601998 3605868 a has-been and a man whose own credible legacy and popularity is in doubt.
3605935 3607670 -What's the upside? -Doubt?
3607737 3613309 Upside? What do you mean, upside? What do I have to do?
3615478 3617647 I'm thirty-three-and-oh with thirty knockouts.
3617714 3620984 I'm doin' you people a favor. I'm havin' this exhibition for you.
3621050 3623252 And you're gonna get up here and make a mockery out of me?
3623319 3625121 I'm the champ.
3625188 3628791 If I get pissed, this guy gets hurt. See you at the fight.
3628858 3630059 (CLAMORING)
3633529 3635331 The guy is a joke. He's gonna get crushed.

3646809 3648711 ROBERT: Hi. How you doing, Uncle Paulie? Have you seen my father?

3650913 3652348 (TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
3659188 3660256 Excuse me.
3662325 3666129 How you doin'? Glad you came by.
3666629 3667930 Can I talk with you?
3667997 3670166 -Sure. -Can we do it outside?
3675371 3676673 So you're goin' through with this?
3676739 3678141 I start training tomorrow.
3678207 3679909 Hey, Rock!
3679976 3682178 I made some connections. I can make
3682245 3684247 some money on this, endorsements.
3685581 3686949 Absolutely. Do that.
3687016 3688785 -Thank you. -Sure.
3690186 3691854 So you nervous about the fight?
3691921 3693589 Scared to death.
3693656 3694724 You don't look scared.
3694791 3696626 I ain't supposed to.
3696693 3699295 Then you don't have to do it.
3699362 3700930 I think I do.
3704500 3709138 You know, living with you hasn't been easy. People see me
3709205 3711274 but they think of you. With all this
3711340 3713609 goin' on, it's gonna be worse than ever.
3713676 3715712 -It don't have to be. -Sure, it does!
3715778 3717447 Why? You've got a lot goin' on, kid.
3717513 3720416 What, my last name? That's the reason I got a decent job.
3720483 3722985 That's why people deal with me in the first place.
3723052 3724721 Now I start to get a little ahead
3724787 3728691 to get a little somethin' for myself, and this happens.
3728758 3732829 I'm askin' you as a favor not to go through with this. Okay?
3732895 3734197 This is gonna end up bad for you,
3734263 3735765 and it's gonna end up bad for me.
3735832 3736966 You think I'm hurting you?
3737033 3739168 In a way, you are.
3739235 3740737 That's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
3740803 3742638 I know that's not what you wanna do,
3742705 3744373 but that's just the way that it is!
3744440 3746976 Don't you care what people think? Doesn't it bother you that
3747043 3749045 people are making you out to be a joke
3749112 3750913 and that I'll be included in that?
3750980 3753983 Do you think that's right? Do you?
3759956 3765194 You ain't gonna believe this. But you used to fit right here.
3765261 3767463 I'd hold you up and say to your mother,
3767530 3770199 "This kid is gonna be the best kid in the world."
3770266 3773903 "This kid is gonna be somebody better than anybody ever knew."
3773970 3776572 And you grew up good and wonderful.
3776639 3780076 It was great just watching, every day was like a privilege.
3780143 3781344 Then the time came for you to be
3781410 3783246 your own man and take on the world,
3783312 3787250 and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed.
3787884 3789719 You stopped being you.
3789786 3793089 You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're no good.
3793156 3794824 And when things got hard, you started
3794891 3796692 lookin' for somethin' to blame,
3796759 3798327 like a big shadow.
3800363 3802899 Lemme tell you somethin' you already know.
3802965 3805334 The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
3805401 3807436 It's a very mean and nasty place.
3807503 3809305 And I don't care how tough you are,
3809372 3812608 it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently
3812675 3813843 if you let it.
3813910 3817513 Nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.
3817580 3819916 But it ain't about how hard you hit.
3819982 3822118 It's about how hard you can get hit
3822185 3823619 and keep movin' forward.
3823686 3826989 How much you can take, and keep movin' forward.
3827056 3829659 That's how winnin' is done!
3829725 3832595 If you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth.
3832662 3836065 But you gotta be willin' to take the hits. And not pointing fingers
3836132 3837700 sayin' you aren't where you want to be
3837767 3840069 because of him or her, or anybody!
3840136 3844173 Cowards do that, and that ain't you! You're better than that!
3851514 3856219 I'm always gonna love you, no matter what happens.
3857286 3859789 You're my son and you're my blood.
3859856 3862458 You're the best thing in my life.
3863960 3868164 But until you start believing in yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.
3873035 3875037 Don't forget to visit your mother.
3925588 3926689 Those are beautiful.
3930026 3931827 You get off early from work?
3931894 3936232 No. I left. I quit.
3937767 3939268 Quit, why?
3939669 3940703 (SIGHS)
3940770 3942371 I wasn't very...
3943806 3946709 I just didn't fit in there.
3948811 3950112 I understand.
3954984 3956085 So what are you gonna do?
3956152 3957420 Right now?
3959622 3961190 Right now I'd rather be with you.
3964727 3965728 Is that alright?
3967697 3969598 Yeah.
3969665 3972134 It's been a long time since I've seen a fight.
3984280 3987416 DUKE: You know all there is to know about fighting, so there's no sense
3987483 3989819 going down that same road again.
3989885 3994457 To beat this guy, you need speed. You don't have it.
3995825 4000029 And your knees can't take the pounding. So hard running is out.
4000096 4001964 And you've got arthritis in your neck.
4002031 4003666 And you've got calcium deposits
4003733 4007303 on most of your joints. So sparring is out.
4008137 4010272 I had that problem.
4010339 4015711 So what we'll be calling on is good old-fashioned blunt force trauma.
4015778 4020583 Horsepower. Heavy duty, cast-iron, pile-driving punches
4020649 4024053 that will have to hurt so much they'll rattle his ancestors.
4024120 4025988 Every time you hit him with a shot,
4026055 4029225 it's got to feel like he tried kissing the express train.
4030559 4034463 Yeah! Let's start building some hurting bombs.

4202531 4207236 The undisputed heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon, two-twenty-one!
4210706 4213008 Thank you very much. I appreciate it, champ. Thanks.
4218113 4221617 AUDIENCE: (CHANTING) Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
4230059 4232261 -You know how much money is in this? -A lot of it.
4232328 4234797 Imagine trying to clean this place.
4234863 4236398 -No, seriously. -Balboa!
4240102 4244506 I'll catch up with you guys later, okay? Robert, hang with me.
4246475 4248577 -How you doin', champ? -I'm good.
4250412 4253449 Man, there's no reason for either one of us to get hurt in this fight.
4253515 4255684 I'll do my best to carry you, make sure
4255751 4258287 you save face. It'd be no embarrassment.
4258354 4262925 But I promise you, you try to press me, you hit me, you hurt me,
4262992 4267963 you hit me low, cheap-shot me, I'll get you outta there.
4268030 4272368 You know, a lotta people come to Vegas to lose, but I didn't.
4272434 4273836 It's already over.
4273902 4276171 Ain't nothin' over 'til it's over.
4276238 4277573 What's that from, the eighties?
4277640 4279475 That's probably the seventies.
4283279 4284647 Just remember what I said.
4286048 4287549 Yo! Champ!
4288550 4290052 Ain't you a little scared?
4290986 4292588 I don't get scared.
4295758 4298861 You know, I think you try a little harder when you're scared.
4298927 4301864 This is, uh, what has worked for me.
4302931 4303966 Scared, huh?
4304033 4305434 Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?
4305501 4306969 Come on, let's see what you got.
4307036 4308270 (LAUGHS)
4308337 4309471 Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
4325321 4326522 Hi.
4326588 4327923 How're you doing?
4327990 4329725 Nah, I was just thinking. Did you wanna come in?
4329792 4333629 No. It's okay. I just wanted to
4333696 4336799 come by and wish you good luck for tomorrow.
4336865 4338133 Thanks.
4338200 4341337 Um... I brought you something. I hope you don't mind,
4341403 4342871 I took it from the restaurant.
4344406 4345908 Ah. Adrian.
4347343 4350245 Yeah. That should keep you safe.
4350312 4352614 Yeah. She always brought me luck.
4356185 4357653 Listen, I wanted to say thanks
4357720 4359788 for everything you've done for me and my kid.
4361190 4363092 You've been great and, uh,
4367396 4368797 tomorrow,
4370733 4371934 you're going to prove that the last thing
4372000 4373769 to age in somebody is their heart.
4375471 4376772 (CHUCKLES)
4376839 4377940 I'll try.
4378006 4379241 You go show them.
4379308 4380776 Thank you.
4401797 4403665 JIM LAMPLEY: The heavyweight championship
4403732 4407169 has been one of sports' most coveted titles for 120 years.
4407236 4410172 Two-time heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa,
4410239 4411673 the Philadelphia slugger,
4411740 4413742 renowned for his cast-iron jaw,
4413809 4416712 ferocious body attack, and will of steel,
4416779 4418313 all of which have carried the much
4418380 4420182 smaller fighter to numerous victories
4420249 4423118 over the years against physically superior opponents.
4423185 4425988 And Mason Dixon, the current heavyweight titleholder
4426054 4427823 with all the speed, determination
4427890 4429591 and confidence any fighter could want.
4429658 4431627 But many still question whether
4431693 4433862 he has the heart of a true champion
4433929 4438300 never having been pushed to go the distance. Tonight, we find out.
4438367 4441870 Here at the Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada,
4441937 4443972 for the much-anticipated showdown
4444039 4449445 between Mason "The Line" Dixon and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
4449511 4452481 Hello, again. I'm Jim Lampley with Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman
4452548 4454049 live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel
4454116 4456418 in Las Vegas, where we anticipate
4456485 4459254 one of the most outrageous and compelling events in boxing history.
4459321 4461023 The current unappreciated heavyweight
4461089 4463058 champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon
4463125 4465060 putting his reputation on the line
4465127 4469164 against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion, Rocky Balboa.
4469231 4471099 Even though most see this as more
4471166 4472701 of a glorified sparring session
4472768 4474803 the energy in the room is electric.
4474870 4476905 Larry, why is this billed as an exhibition?
4476972 4482077 -Wild guess, so they wouldn't have to call it an execution! -(CHUCKLING)
4482144 4487182 Zachariah 4:6 says, "It is not by strength, not by might
4487249 4491386 "but by his spirit, we have already claimed the victory
4491453 4496525 "in our Lord Jesus Christ." Good luck, Rocky.
4496592 4498527 Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.
4500295 4503732 (CROWD STOMPING)
4509805 4511607 Nobody's expecting much
4511673 4515644 from the way-past-his-prime former champ, Rocky Balboa.
4516245 4518614 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
4520015 4522818 Look, I know you got a lotta stuff
4522885 4525254 you gotta get out of your system.
4525320 4526822 Huh?
4526889 4531393 Tonight you do it. Right? Get rid of the damn beast,
4531460 4535597 let it be done, once and for all. Please, I love you.
4535664 4539201 (CROWD CHANTING)
4545507 4549244 There go the lights! The buzz is building toward a roaring crescendo.
4555817 4557219 (CROWD CHEERS)
4559655 4563191 (HIGH HOPES PLAYING)
4566094 4568397 -Where did that come from? -(LAUGHING)
4568463 4570999 I told you. I love Sinatra.
4572267 4573869 He's very good, Sinatra.
4574403 4575504 Let's go.
4575571 4577039 Very good.
4578473 4580208 (CROWD CHEERS)
4580275 4584279 LARRY MERCHANT: And he re comes Rocky Balboa, veteran of the wars
4584346 4586782 here for one more last hurrah.
4586848 4589818 LAMPLEY: Or the Last Supper, perhaps, with him as the main course.
4589885 4592921 MERCHANT: What's that music? You can't be serious.
4592988 4595557 "High Hopes"? Talk about wishful thinking.
4595624 4599795 Well, maybe no hopes is more realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.
4599861 4603098 MAX KELLERMAN: Look at the Italian Stallion! Cool and relaxed!
4603165 4607102 MERCHANT: Rocky's an off-the-board underdog, and they don't care at all.
4607169 4611406 KELLERMAN: This is about his pride and dignity and his punch, guys.
4611473 4614076 The last thing to go is a guy's punch.
4614142 4616979 Rocky always has that puncher's chance.
4619748 4621750 (CROWD CHEERING)
4621817 4626154 LAMPLEY: Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear, the people's champion.
4626221 4628323 KELLERMAN: Prediction, guys, for at least two rounds,
4628390 4630726 Dixon's going to have his hands full.
4630792 4634830 MERCHANT: Two whole rounds? We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.
4635664 4637265 How you doin'?
4637332 4639501 The crowd wants to see something real, or at least...
4639568 4641837 Rocky Balboa just asked me how I'm doing.
4641903 4644239 I grew up watching this guy.
4644306 4647042 I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights!
4647109 4649277 This is unbelievable! I'm a fan. I can't help it.
4649344 4651546 -(CROWD BOOING) -MERCHANT: Here comes Mason Dixon.
4651613 4652981 (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
4679741 4681176 (CROWD BOOING)
4686715 4689051 LAMPLEY: Mason Dixon establishing his presence in the ring.
4689117 4693255 And suddenly now a conversation breaking out at ringside.
4693321 4696725 Mike Tyson calling out Mason "The Line" Dixon.
4698593 4704266 This is charity work! You got that midget with you right there!
4707803 4709604 (BELL RINGING)
4709671 4713442 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Mandalay Bay
4713508 4716611 Resort and Casino of Las Vegas
4716678 4720515 and a special main event of the evening
4720582 4723819 ten rounds of heavyweight excitement!
4723885 4726555 Sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
4726621 4728757 And when the bell rings, the referee
4728824 4732060 -in charge of the action, Joe Cortez! -(CROWD CHEERING)
4732127 4737299 And now, for the thousands in attendance and the millions watching
4737365 4741636 around the world, ladies and gentlemen,
4741703 4749311 let's get ready to rumble!
4749377 4752581 Introducing first, fighting out of the blue corner
4752647 4757552 wearing black with gold, official weight, two hundred seventeen pounds.
4757619 4760055 His professional record, fifty-seven
4760122 4762357 victories including fifty-four knockouts
4762424 4765627 -with twenty-three defeats and one draw. -(CROWD CHANTING)
4765694 4769164 He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,
4769231 4773802 the two-time heavyweight champion of the world,
4773869 4781243 "The Italian Stallion," Rocky
4781309 4783578 Balboa!
4783645 4785347 (ALL CHEERING)
4786281 4787949 Hope he gets his head busted.
4790285 4791486 Shut up.
4794356 4797359 MICHAEL BUFFER: Across the ring, fighting out of the red corner
4797425 4801563 wearing white with blue, official weight, two hundred twenty-one pounds.
4801630 4804132 He has a perfect professional record,
4804199 4806501 consisting of thirty-three bouts,
4806568 4810138 thirty-three victories, including thirty knockouts.
4810205 4812140 Originally from Tampa, Florida,
4812207 4815377 but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,
4815443 4819981 the reigning undisputed, undefeated
4820048 4823118 heavyweight champion of the world,
4823185 4826822 -Mason "The Line" -(CROWD BOOING)
4826888 4830625 Dixon!
4836932 4839000 Alright, Mason, Rocky.
4839067 4841169 We went over the rules in the dressing room.
4841236 4844439 I expect a good, clean fight. Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,
4844506 4846374 those low blows, be careful with those, alright?
4846441 4848343 Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
4848410 4851613 Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair but I'm firm. Touch them up!
4851680 4853148 Enjoy the ride.
4853215 4854783 LAMPLEY: The champ is not in the best shape
4854850 4857085 we've seen him in. Maybe he just plans
4857152 4859187 to phone this one in and go home early. That wouldn't be a surprise.
4859254 4860822 Love you, kid. Glad you could make it.
4860889 4862991 KELLERMAN: One thing about Rocky we know for sure,
4863058 4865694 this guy's showing up in shape.
4865760 4866895 The old man's crazy.
4866962 4868029 He's gotta be crazy.
4868096 4869931 -He's in here. -Okay.
4869998 4872434 Just take it easy. This is an exhibition. Alright? Do it to him!
4872500 4874135 You got three rounds to set a pace.
4874202 4875637 Every time you hit him, you gotta make a dent.
4875704 4877906 Got it.
4877973 4881977 KELLERMAN: The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight? I can't believe it's here!
4882043 4885714 -(BELL RINGS) -Round one begins. If old George Forman
4885780 4889951 shocked the world with one punch, why can't old Rocky Balboa?
4890018 4892654 LAMPLEY: And as much excitement as there is in the arena,
4892721 4895156 there's a sense of foreboding, as well.
4899427 4901296 And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon
4901363 4903632 goes to work with his jab as though
4903698 4905800 he's fighting against the number one challenger
4905867 4907369 in the heavyweight division.
4907435 4909571 KELLERMAN: This is to be expected early on.
4909638 4911606 You knew the champ was going to control the distance
4911673 4913942 with his jab, his height, his range.
4915810 4920015 LAMPLEY: Balboa, looking to gain a shot, misses wildly.
4921683 4924719 MERCHANT: It looks like a speed bag against a punching bag.
4924786 4926655 LAMPLEY: Rocky is understandably frustrated,
4926721 4928857 but he came out of retirement to get into a fight.
4928924 4931660 KELLERMAN: Guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed with.
4931726 4934095 One punch could still turn it around.
4934162 4937132 MERCHANT: Apparently he forgot his arthritis meds this morning.
4937198 4939000 LAMPLEY: Rocky misses.
4939067 4942103 There's a meat-seeking missile on the point of the chin by the champ!
4942170 4945307 -(CROWD CHANTING) -More pinpoint jabs by Dixon!
4945373 4948977 And there's a hard right hand and a left and a right by Balboa!
4949044 4952781 -He drives Dixon into the ropes with a series of shots! -(CROWD CHEERING)
4952847 4954549 And the crowd goes berserk!
4954616 4955750 (GRUNTING)
4959587 4964326 Dixon punishing Balboa for the temerity of landing those shots.
4967228 4971533 It's toe-to-toe in the corner. Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
4977172 4979107 (BELL RINGS)
4979174 4982110 Balboa landing potent combinations to the head of the champion.
4982177 4983812 A wake-up call for Dixon.
4983878 4985547 -You alright? -Yeah.
4985613 4987382 The man's got bricks in his gloves.
4987449 4988817 What happened to the angry stuff in the basement?
4988883 4990352 It's still there.
4990418 4991586 -He came to battle, okay? -He tried to knock me out.
4991653 4993288 Listen to me. If there's any bone
4993355 4994990 in your body he can break, he's gonna do it.
4995056 4996891 -His bones break, too. -Give the man a little respect.
4996958 4998626 What about my respect?
4998693 5000595 LAMPLEY: Compubox numbers tell the grisly story here.
5000662 5003798 Balboa landed nine of thirteen punches in that round.
5003865 5009037 Dixon landed an incredible fifty-nine out of sixty-nine.
5009104 5010705 Why don't you listen to me this time!
5010772 5012774 KELLERMAN: Rocky's been here a million times before.
5012841 5014509 Coming out to start another round
5014576 5016144 after he took a beating in the previous one.
5016211 5017512 Remember what I said, okay?
5017579 5019414 I warned him.
5019481 5021583 -(CROWD CHANTING) -(BELL RINGS)
5021649 5024986 LAMPLEY: He's tired. His legs are going fast, or already gone.
5025053 5030058 KELLERMAN: And what's truly extraordinary is that Rocky can still take it.
5030125 5034729 MERCHANT: The boxing commission, which, was criticized for licensing him
5034796 5038767 would be massacred if something happened to Rocky.
5039868 5040902 (GRUNTING)
5042637 5045807 LAMPLEY: And a monstrous straight left hand! Down goes Rocky!
5045874 5048143 And that could conceivably be the end of the fight!
5048209 5052113 That could be the exhibition right there! But no! Balboa is up!
5052180 5054616 Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
5054682 5056985 to continue, and Rocky says yes.
5057052 5059621 Even Rocky Balboa could be too brave for his own good.
5059687 5063525 Dixon comes right back to try to finish it! Balboa almost went down!
5063591 5065760 MERCHANT: Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
5065827 5068229 LAMPLEY: As Dixon lands these brutal shots!
5068296 5070331 Cover up! Cover up!
5070398 5073768 Open shots at close range, right and left hands, and down goes Balboa!
5073835 5076771 -(CROWD BOOING) -Perhaps for the last time in his fighting career!
5076838 5078807 MERCHANT: That should do it.
5078873 5081943 Four! Five! Six!
5082410 5083978 Get up! Get up!
5084045 5087515 Eight! Nine!
5087582 5089250 How do you feel, Mac? You okay?
5089317 5091386 LAMPLEY: Now Rocky is furious with himself.
5091453 5093588 He convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting!
5093655 5095523 Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,
5095590 5097725 Rocky waving his arms and saying he's fine!
5097792 5099894 -He wants to go on! -Let it go! Let it go!
5100862 5103731 And Balboa comes back! With a left and a right
5103798 5107335 and bulls Dixon into the ropes for the second round in a row!
5107969 5109637 (CROWD BOOING)
5109704 5112006 And back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots...
5112073 5113575 Dixon hurt his hand there!
5113641 5115110 Go after him!
5115176 5117245 LAMPLEY: This is Rocky's best chance right here!
5117312 5119514 -The champ obviously just hurt his hand on Rocky's hip! -(CROWD CHANTING)
5119581 5122550 And Balboa immediately going to work to the body! Huge right hook!
5122617 5126754 Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body! These are big punches.
5130291 5131493 (CROWD CHEERING)
5135096 5139801 Rocky Balboa has knocked the reigning heavyweight champion down!
5139868 5141703 You hurt him, Rocky!
5141769 5144305 Mason "The Line" Dixon has never taken this kind of punishment
5144372 5146007 in his entire professional career!
5146074 5147809 KELLERMAN: Maybe he's clearing his head, guys,
5147876 5150445 but the body shots really caved in his ribs.
5150512 5153381 LAMPLEY: Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
5153448 5156584 KELLERMAN: Another counterhook by Balboa, followed by two more!
5156651 5159954 LAMPLEY: Dixon fires back his own hooks! Now Rocky's stunned.
5160021 5162257 -(CROWD CHANTING) -It's an all-out war along the ropes
5162323 5166094 as round two comes to a close amid a giant tumult in the ring!

5177605 5179541 -How's the hand? -I think it's broken.
5182410 5184379 We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
5184445 5187115 It will numb up on you in a few rounds. Alright?
5187182 5190852 Once that hand numbs up, Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
5190919 5193388 Until then, here is Rocky's chance.
5193454 5195089 DUKE: No reverse!
5195156 5196724 MARTIN: Take the pain, champ.

5402397 5404665 Who would have believed this was possible?
5404732 5405867 Can you see out of that eye?
5405933 5407802 Let me talk to him. Look at me.
5407869 5409637 Don't take any more chances out there than you have to.
5409704 5412673 There's nothing more to prove, Pop.
5412740 5414842 I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
5414909 5417211 PAULIE: You can do it, Rocko!
5417278 5418379 One more round, we go home.

5440668 5442703 (BELL RINGS)
5442770 5445239 LAMPLEY: Tenth round of a scheduled ten. Who would ever have dreamed
5445306 5449844 that Rocky Balboa would still be in this, quote, "exhibition" against
5449911 5451345 the heavyweight champion of the world?

5496390 5498659 ROCKY: What is it you said to the kid?
5498726 5500695 It ain't about how hard you hit.
5500761 5504799 It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
5504866 5508536 How much you can take and keep moving forward.

5615743 5617812 -ROCKY: Hey, Paulie... -(LAUGHS)
5617878 5620581 That beast is gone now. The beast is out.
5620648 5624485 One of the most overused words in sports, guys, is "incredible."
5624552 5628222 I hate to say it. This is incredible.
5630691 5632093 Let's go!
5634762 5638566 MICHAEL BUFFER: Ladies gentlemen, before we go to the scorecards,
