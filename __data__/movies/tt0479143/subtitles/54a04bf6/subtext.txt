107833 111479 Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,<br />almost perfunctory.
111486 113572 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
113589 116859 Hide the women and children.<br />This could get ugly.
116884 121388 This crowd does nothing to hide<br />its anger over this latest debacle.
121413 124207 The fans are mad as hell.<br />They don't want to take it any more.
124232 126852 They seem to be blaming Dixon,<br />a good fighter,
126877 131714 for the decline not only of the heavyweight<br />division guys, but of the entire sport.
131739 137279 They're actually pelting the undefeated<br />heavyweight champion with ice.
137304 142773 Maybe this angry reaction will pressure<br />Dixon to fight someone who can fight back,
142797 144421 if there's somebody out there.
144446 149589 All of boxing is hoping for a warrior<br />who thrills us with his passion.
297435 299686 Time goes by too fast.
299711 302305 Yeah? Not fast enough.
303011 305401 - Your kid should've been here.<br />- That's all right.
305430 306740 No, it ain't all right.
306765 309286 The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
309310 311095 He don't get that busy.
311120 315540 Well, let's not talk about it here, OK?<br />You're coming tonight, right?
315565 319276 I'm working.<br />I took the tour the last three years.
319301 321297 I know, but it's the anniversary.
321715 325321 - Fine. You got my word.<br />- I appreciate it. Thank you.
325695 327344 I owe you, Paulie.
359419 363186 Robert, what's going on?<br />Where've you been? You're late.
364465 366131 I don't want to hear it.
366156 370159 Your job performance is nowhere near<br />good enough to be pulling this.
370184 372670 I don't give a damn who your father is.<br />You understand me?
373608 375709 All right. Now get outta here.
376008 377233 Thank you, sir.
380140 381529 Yo, Robert.
382009 383014 Yo.
384597 386873 - Hey, how you doin'?<br />- What's up, champ?
387762 389473 You caught me off guard.
389498 391658 I wanted to catch you before you got busy.
391683 393479 Yeah, it gets busy up there.
393503 394720 So how you doin'?
394745 396600 - Real good.<br />- Yeah?
396625 397818 Yo, Rock!
397843 399646 Yeah, how you doin'?
399671 401295 Yeah, real good.
401597 404002 You wanna go out and get some coffee?
404027 406487 I'm kinda behind. Maybe later?
406511 408300 Yeah, that'd be great.
408325 412203 Come by the restaurant tonight.<br />I can have something made special for you.
412228 416855 Tonight I can't. I got plans.<br />A few of the guys get together, you know?
416880 418455 Did I do something wrong?
418479 419549 What do you mean?
419574 425119 Well... I don't know exactly what I mean,<br />but I just think that when I come here
425143 429295 you don't feel so comfortable<br />and I certainly don't wanna do that.
430263 432834 You... You throw a big shadow.
432849 433767 A big shadow?
433792 435956 You won't get anything done<br />down here, Robert.
436331 439792 If you won't introduce me, then I will.<br />I'm William Tomilson.
439903 442136 - How you doin'?<br />- Your son works for me.
442426 444261 It's a good job.
444586 447672 I've told Robert about 20 times<br />that I wanted to meet you.
447697 450417 I guess you're pretty busy,<br />which isn't a bad thing, is it?
450450 452487 Grab a shot, will you, please?
452820 456239 I may not get this chance again.<br />Old warhorses gotta stick together.
456264 458268 - The old horses, yeah.<br />- I tell you.
459448 462628 - It's a good thing it's not your left.<br />- This makes you very popular.
463123 465954 - One, two, three.<br />- Finally we get to meet.
466042 468568 Oh, I gotta get going.<br />It was nice to meet you face to face.
468593 470464 - How you doin'?<br />- You take care of yourself.
470470 471931 Robert, I'll see you later.
474786 478384 I gotta get going.<br />I'll change my plans for tonight.
478409 480612 That'd be great.<br />I'm lookin' forward to it.
481231 483232 - OK.<br />- OK.
484034 487546 And do not let those numbers<br />drive you crazy.
487571 488655 Too late.
488679 491206 Use an eraser and get rid of all of 'em.
494580 496300 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hey, Rock.
496325 498042 How you doin'?
513185 514323 Here you go.
519209 522948 It'll be about ten tenths, OK?<br />You guys take care, OK? You got it.
526018 528315 I'll try a few of these later on.
529208 531479 - It's good for bakin'.<br />- How much?
531781 533992 - Paul, what's the cost?<br />- 58.40, sir.
534026 536519 Right. Take it out of that. I trust you.
538958 541276 - You're generous.<br />- Not a problem.
558529 560297 How you guys doin'?
567173 569258 How we doin', Isabel?
569490 572075 OK, except for the freebie<br />readin' the Bible.
572100 573371 He's OK.
573406 576134 Just cos you fought him<br />don't mean you gotta feed him forever.
576159 577981 He doesn't even look like a fighter.
578006 579537 Spider Rico could hit.
579562 582474 - Listen, how's your stomach?<br />- It's OK.
582499 586978 If you keep rubbing that olive oil on your<br />stomach, your kid will be born very strong.
587003 589133 - OK, whatever you say.<br />- No, really.
592764 595558 - Yo, how you doin', Spider?<br />- God bless you, Rocky.
595583 596833 Thanks.
602057 604578 - How you guys doin'?<br />- Hi, Rocky.
606022 609942 Jose, can you make something special<br />for my kid who's comin' tonight?
609967 611492 No problemo.
611574 614203 Good. I appreciate it.
616259 619344 Back and forth, back and forth.<br />Give and take.
619369 622663 Then I went in there like an animal<br />and threw him into the corner
622688 626661 and I unloaded everything I had -<br />hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
626668 631582 But Creed, he kept busting me back<br />pretty good and the agony began to pile up.
631607 634758 Then I heard the best sound<br />I ever heard in my life...
635274 636703 - The bell.<br />- Right, the bell.
636728 640115 And I ain't ever been so tired<br />and I'm sittin' in my corner
640140 644852 and I'm trying to figure out how to survive<br />the last round when Mickey says:
644894 648315 "Come on. Get out there<br />and fight this guy hard, you bum."
648332 650667 "You gotta be first. You gotta be first."
650692 653137 I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could..."
653161 654194 "I would."
654237 657366 "I would." The end.
657373 659258 - Salud.<br />- Salud.
684065 687430 Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,<br />almost perfunctory.
687455 690000 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
690289 696461 They're actually pelting the undefeated<br />heavyweight champion with ice.
701886 703555 Hello, Adrian's.
703775 705055 Yeah?
705606 707625 Tell him you can't make it?
707976 709696 Yeah, I'll give him the message.
710687 715607 I just kept hearing, you know, Mickey's<br />voice in my head over and over again.
715632 721011 I just dug down and before you know it,<br />it was toe-to-toe and it was... Excuse me.
721036 724946 Your son said he can't make it.<br />He said he'll take a rain check. OK?
739048 743134 Look at these birds.<br />Don't these birds look like flying candy?
743159 746953 Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?<br />You need somebody to walk you home?
749808 754196 It's a cold night. We need a few laughs<br />in our life. What do you think?
755205 757516 Maybe? Maybe?
757541 759711 OK, let's get outta here. OK?
775188 777669 This place ain't changed much<br />from last year.
777694 778899 We done?
779742 781758 Hey, how you doin', Mick?
785016 787043 That sign's fallin' apart, Paulie.
787067 790348 The whole world's fallin' apart.<br />Look at us.
790373 792492 Don't talk crazy, Paulie.
792979 798068 You know, I think if you live someplace<br />long enough, you are that place.
799048 801115 I ain't no talkin' building.
801538 803349 Come on, it's gettin' late.
804262 806513 I get a headache from this train.
826868 833456 I remember when she was standin' there<br />all nervous and shy with this little smile,
834346 837448 and all I wanted her to do was trust me.
840882 842667 She did.
843843 845190 She did.
845304 846448 You done?
861929 864805 - How long we stayin' here?<br />- Not long.
864830 867413 I'm glad they tore this rink down.
867437 868760 Come on.
868785 872206 You heard me. I'm happy they tore it apart.
876385 880722 The first time I walked your sister<br />across this ice, we was over there.
880964 884299 She was nervous, but I weren't<br />so great on the blades either.
884324 888464 Ice is stupid.<br />People standing on ice are more stupid.
889889 893393 Then over there, when she was fallin',
894150 900120 my hand grabbed her and I got her arm.<br />Through that coat I could feel it.
901526 902979 Electric.
903754 906214 You said the same thing last year, Rock.
907382 910009 - Did I?<br />- You better develop your brain.
910034 912917 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
913139 915190 Come on, Rock, let's go.
917797 921884 We're done. There's no place<br />to sit down around here.
921909 923413 It's all right.
923437 927159 It ain't all right.<br />It's depressing and freakin' cold!
928737 930577 What's the matter with you, Paulie?
930601 932740 You're livin' backwards, Rocko.
932765 936184 Change the channel from yesterday.<br />Yesterday wasn't so great.
936209 937687 It was to me.
937711 939026 Not to me!
940708 944456 You treated her good.<br />You had the good times.
944712 948268 I treated her bad.<br />I don't have to think about this.
949539 951749 She always loved you, Paulie.
956093 959470 Sorry, Rocko. I can't do this no more.
1032447 1033686 Can I help you?
1033711 1037597 Nah, nah. I used to come down this place<br />a long time ago. Just lookin' around.
1037630 1039128 No big deal.
1040164 1041745 Can I get you a drink?
1043404 1045218 All right, maybe just a short beer.
1045242 1046378 OK.
1057473 1062310 Go. Yeah, go on. Get him to buy you one.<br />Get him to buy you one. Go.
1063060 1064995 He's got it. He's spending money.
1065663 1069961 Listen... I don't mean<br />to cross the line or anything,
1069986 1074140 but I read about your wife's passin'<br />a few years back.
1074165 1076737 - Yeah, it was woman cancer.<br />- Yeah.
1076762 1078745 I always heard she was a nice person.
1079129 1080956 Yeah, the best.
1082524 1083710 Do I know you?
1083734 1085464 We met a long time ago.
1085489 1086702 We did?
1086726 1088909 When I was a kid, you walked me home.
1089471 1090312 I did?
1090336 1092659 Told me to stop smokin' and things.
1094279 1095823 Stop smokin'?
1097101 1100825 Are you little Marie that used to hang out<br />at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
1100850 1102151 Yeah, that's right.
1103352 1105788 Yeah, now I remember.<br />I walked you home.
1105813 1109691 When you got there, you turned around<br />and said, "Screw you, creepo."
1109716 1112176 - I didn't say that.<br />- Yeah, you did.
1112295 1113476 You sure?
1113500 1115840 Great insults last a long time.
1115865 1116886 Yo!
1117275 1120595 - Yo, is that you? Is that really you?<br />- How you doin'?
1120620 1122398 I think he wants to drink alone.
1122422 1124206 Well, then, give him his drink.
1124231 1129097 I ain't stoppin' you. What's that, your man<br />or something? No, I don't think so.
1132022 1136861 Anyway, me and my friends, we're down<br />there. You think you could buy us a round?
1136886 1138887 You got the money. Just one round.
1138912 1140011 Hey...
1141841 1145119 What...? What are you doin'<br />pushin' my hand away like that?
1145144 1147938 - What's your name?<br />- Angie. Why do you wanna know?
1147963 1150218 Angie, don't be playin' a fool<br />for that guy.
1150242 1151465 - A fool?<br />- Yeah.
1151490 1155254 A fool? I'm the fool?<br />You're the fool, not me.
1155279 1158573 You got it twisted. You're the fool.<br />I'm a person just like you.
1158598 1162143 You ain't no better than me. You think<br />you're a big shot now? You ain't nothing.
1162276 1165643 You ain't no better than me.<br />No better.
1166582 1167690 Wow.
1167898 1169227 Glad you dropped in?
1169252 1171667 I think the neighbourhood's<br />changin' a little.
1172734 1175651 - What was that all about?<br />- I don't know. It's OK.
1175676 1178928 Well, if you wanna take off,<br />I'll tally everything up.
1178953 1179882 Thanks.
1179906 1182261 - How you doin', Rock?<br />- I'm good, thanks.
1184913 1186429 You live around here?
1186453 1188268 About eight blocks from here.
1189128 1190729 Eight blocks.
1191943 1193479 Would you need a lift?
1194372 1195372 All right.
1196500 1198495 Did you ever get married?
1198601 1199627 Yeah, sorta.
1199652 1201597 - Sorta?<br />- Well, he took off.
1201622 1204729 - Poof, just like that?<br />- Yeah, just like that.
1205574 1208576 - You sorta have any kids?<br />- Yeah, I got one kid.
1208601 1210682 Yeah, me too. Me too.
1211208 1213876 - Wonderful boy.<br />- Hey, tough guy!
1214064 1216479 What's the matter?<br />You can't buy a round?
1216504 1218964 Girl was bein' nice to your dumb ass.
1219403 1221432 Yeah, what you doin' with that pig?
1221751 1224526 - She ain't nothin' but a jealous bitch.<br />- Come on back!
1225141 1226933 Hey, don't listen to 'em.
1226958 1229932 Both of yous.<br />You ain't no better than me!
1230271 1232948 - Come over here!<br />- Everybody's her man.
1233618 1237913 - You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.<br />- You ain't no big shot! Look at you!
1237938 1241370 You ain't even got a car<br />to take that pig home.
1244667 1246175 You all right?
1247663 1248698 Yeah.
1251046 1254323 What are you doing?<br />Don't get out. It's all right.
1256756 1259659 No, little Marie, it ain't all right.
1264742 1266657 - Yo!<br />- What?
1266682 1269972 I'll tell you what. Get inside.<br />You get inside.
1270446 1272151 Hey! Leave him alone!
1273238 1275768 - You see that? You see that?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1275793 1278045 - What do you say?<br />- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
1278070 1279659 Good job.
1296105 1298347 That guy sends his apologies.
1299074 1300245 OK.
1317209 1318464 Martin.
1318818 1321565 Martin. Yo, Martin!
1326495 1328378 I see you still got your key.
1328410 1331029 Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?
1331054 1333806 I got a lot of time<br />since your people let me go.
1333831 1335909 You know I had nothing to do with that.
1336329 1337440 Yeah?
1339588 1342566 - Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.<br />- Yeah?
1342591 1344093 I mean, it's only temporary.
1344117 1345528 Yeah, I can see that.
1345553 1348987 - I'm gonna look for an apartment.<br />- Apartments are nice.
1349012 1350882 Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
1350906 1352831 Yeah. It is what it is.
1353161 1356557 But this place used to be nice.<br />There's a lot of history around here.
1356582 1359917 Yeah, like down the street there<br />is the Cambria Fight Club.
1359942 1363671 They used to call that the Bucket of Blood.<br />I took some massive beatings there.
1363696 1370405 But it was nice. Good memories. I heard<br />these buildings are 100, 150 years old.
1370713 1373350 So, I mean, if I was 150 years old<br />I'd be falling apart too,
1373373 1375653 so it's OK the buildings...
1375929 1377221 Does that light work?
1377245 1379498 No, it's burnt out or something.
1382465 1385952 Hey, listen. Thanks for the ride,<br />and I'm sorry about those guys.
1385968 1390557 Oh, that's OK. Some of those guys just<br />got their brains on backwards and stuff.
1390575 1392280 What's he doin' out so late?
1392448 1393552 Is that your kid?
1393577 1395944 Yeah. I wish he wouldn't stay out so late.
1396230 1397366 Amazing.
1397645 1398874 Yeah? What's that?
1398899 1404111 Oh, last time I seen you, you was a kid,<br />and now you officially got one of your own.
1404136 1405643 It's amazing.
1405667 1409608 You know, he sorta resembles you.<br />He's got that, you know, big Irish hair.
1410377 1412006 Yeah, it's the other one.
1415165 1416268 Yeah?
1416300 1417508 His father was from Jamaica.
1417533 1419303 Jamaica? European.
1422188 1424248 Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?
1424636 1425816 No, not really.
1425841 1427670 - What's his name?<br />- Steps.
1428719 1429763 Short for Stevenson.
1429769 1431327 Right. Makes sense.
1434967 1438454 Is he lookin' like he's mad at me,<br />or is it the angle I'm standin' at?
1438479 1440264 No, no, no. He's a good kid.
1440941 1442223 You want to meet him?
1442248 1445959 You know, it's gettin' kinda late.<br />I got so many things to do. It's...
1445984 1447420 Yeah, I understand.
1448304 1451334 Thanks again for the ride<br />and everything else.
1454054 1455139 I'll see you.
1456747 1458108 You too.
1458425 1462139 Hey, Steps, come on, let's go.<br />Say good night to your friend.
1462580 1466124 What are you doin' out with no hat on?<br />Did you get something to eat?
1466149 1468725 - Did you eat your dinner?<br />- Yeah, I already ate.
1469663 1471725 You're late, you know? I've told you...
1472648 1473983 Yo, little Marie.
1475767 1477909 Ain't you going to introduce me<br />to your kid?
1477934 1479514 How you doin', Steps?
1479687 1480522 What's up?
1480527 1485525 Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,<br />nice little eatery not too far from here.
1485550 1487311 What's all this junk? A tissue...
1487784 1491632 Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo<br />with all the stuff in my pocket.
1491657 1493825 Here you go. I got a card, there it is.
1493850 1499098 And if you ever get a chance, it'd be great<br />if both of you come down there and eat.
1499123 1501207 It'd be great. Free. You know?
1501250 1504577 Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.
1506130 1509340 I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.
1513389 1515045 See you later.
1517143 1518881 Come on, let's go.
1521772 1526022 You've known what's best for you since<br />you were ten and walked in here alone.
1526913 1530998 Got everything money can buy...<br />except what it can't.
1532424 1534295 It's pride.
1534320 1537061 Pride is what got your ass outta here.
1537703 1539998 Losin' it is what brung you back.
1541349 1546270 But people like you, they need<br />to be tested. Need a challenge.
1546295 1549130 That ain't gonna happen.<br />Ain't nothin' out there.
1549155 1552241 There's always somebody out there.<br />Always.
1552819 1556280 And when you find somethin'<br />standin' in front of you,
1556305 1558932 somethin' that ain't runnin',<br />ain't backin' up,
1558957 1562905 and it's hittin' on you<br />and you're too damn tired to breathe...
1563787 1569231 You find that situation on you, that's<br />good, cos that's baptism under fire.
1571210 1576005 You get through that, you find<br />the only kind of respect that matters -
1576030 1577739 self-respect.
1580888 1583215 Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.
1583792 1585864 Now, what can the champ do for you?
1587021 1588770 You can give me some of that money you got.
1590965 1592352 You know I like you, Martin.
1592376 1593739 But not that much.
1600335 1602610 How about a picture with the kid, Rock?<br />Is that all right?
1602634 1603809 Sure.
1606123 1609012 Here, son, hold up your fist.<br />Makes you look more hazardous.
1611419 1612836 - There you go.<br />- Thanks.
1612962 1614794 Enjoy your meal.
1615549 1617153 - He's a nice guy.<br />- Rocky?
1617334 1621128 - Yeah?<br />- Listen. Spider just went downstairs.
1621153 1624169 - What's he doin' down there?<br />- I don't know. That's your friend.
1630753 1632273 Yo, Spider.
1632298 1634313 Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
1634337 1635925 Oh, come on. You're my guest.
1635950 1637235 Let me do something.
1637259 1638676 Keep eating. Guests do.
1638701 1641619 Don't make me fight you again.<br />Last time you got lucky.
1641644 1643801 Lucky? OK.
1643826 1645630 Jesus wants me to work.
1646353 1647606 Yo, Rocky.
1647631 1648604 Yeah?
1648629 1649887 You got guests.
1652622 1654567 Don't get too wet, OK?
1655571 1657530 Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
1663930 1665419 You kept the card.
1665720 1667558 Yeah, I kept the card.
1667684 1670012 - Why don't you sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
1679654 1684020 Because you know what? I walk in there,<br />I say good morning, I do this, I do this.
1684761 1689015 Tonight, boxing once again.<br />Two contrasting styles in almost every way.
1689205 1692583 - Hey, can you turn this up?<br />- Welcome to ESPN's Then Versus Now.
1692608 1694853 Who was the best of all time?
1694878 1699590 If two athletes from different eras could<br />compete, who would come out on top?
1699615 1703409 Given the same rules, using the same<br />equipment, who was the greatest?
1703452 1705539 This week,<br />we feed our facts into the computer.
1705555 1708098 They will weigh in on<br />who they think is supreme,
1708123 1711334 while fielding the comments<br />of our panel of sports writers.
1717142 1718044 Champ!
1720072 1721904 - Yo, champ!<br />- Yeah?
1721929 1724907 Man, come check out this trash<br />they talkin' about you.
1724932 1725993 What you talkin' about?
1726017 1727934 Come check this out. Hurry up.
1728208 1732956 Tonight, the former two-time heavyweight<br />champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.
1732981 1734872 Chuck Johnson, USA Today.
1734897 1739630 Rocky Balboa fought much tougher fights<br />during a much tougher era in boxing.
1739655 1744117 You look at Mason Dixon and his career,<br />he's been spoon-fed his opponents.
1744142 1748012 No question in my mind, not only<br />does Rocky win, but he wins knockout.
1750165 1751505 Rocky!
1753127 1754085 Offspring!
1755313 1758357 - What do you think?<br />- Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.
1758382 1761509 He's never been in real knock-down,<br />drag-out brawls.
1761534 1766080 He's never had to dig down to rally back.<br />If he tries to dig down against Balboa,
1766105 1770630 he's gonna find that he doesn't have a big<br />enough shovel. I clearly give it to Balboa.
1771520 1775090 What happened to you?<br />What happened to you?
1775883 1777501 Burt Randolph Sugar.
1777526 1780862 Dixon has fought cream puffs,<br />so we don't know what he's made of.
1780887 1786308 Both in their primes - and you gotta factor<br />in Dixon's speed, his slashing offence -
1786333 1789168 he cuts Balboa to bits, no doubt.
1789193 1791215 Dixon wins all the way.
1792246 1795669 Here's where our subjectivity ends.<br />Let's see what the computer has to say.
1796897 1799981 Dixon unloads on Balboa.<br />Rocky has no answer.
1800006 1801637 Balboa's eating dirt.
1817861 1822364 Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.<br />He is almost out on his feet.
1822389 1825565 Balboa turning up the heat,<br />hounds him across the ring.
1825590 1828784 He's bitten off more than he can chew<br />this time, believe it.
1828809 1831180 Oh, a murderous right hook!
1831205 1833247 And Dixon is out on his feet!
1833272 1836268 He is out cold<br />as he crumbles to the canvas.
1836293 1839010 And it is Balboa who has won the event!
1841507 1844713 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.
1850851 1852424 I'm glad you liked the food.
1852449 1854534 If you heat that up,<br />it's pretty good in the morning.
1856605 1858284 Yeah, thanks, man.
1858627 1859809 Nice kid.
1859834 1862419 I hope this music ain't<br />givin' you a headache.
1862444 1864737 No, I like it. It's nice.
1865145 1867205 Well, good. Good.
1876583 1879377 Yo. You think Steps wants a job?
1879402 1882529 Make a few bucks in a weekend.<br />It's good makin' your own G.
1882554 1884838 My kid stashed a few bucks doin' that.
1885227 1887096 Why are you being so nice?
1888136 1890758 I don't want you to think nothing's off,<br />you know?
1890764 1893648 My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.
1893673 1896078 Yeah, I wasn't thinkin' that, believe me.
1896103 1898611 No? Then what was you thinkin'?
1898783 1901500 That you don't owe us nothin'.<br />What are you doin'?
1901525 1903008 Be patient.
1903527 1912120 No, I don't owe you nothin',<br />but why you gotta owe something to get...
1912145 1913980 Yo! Yikes.
1914121 1915328 Bingo.
1920741 1924106 But why you gotta owe something<br />to get something, you know?
1924131 1925164 Really.
1928773 1931905 I think hangin' out with your kid<br />would be nice. What do you think?
1931930 1933633 I think that'd be nice.
1935042 1936305 Good.
1937058 1940518 That's very nice. I'm glad you come by.
1941316 1944193 Nice... nice watchin' you eat.
1946456 1948148 Good company.
1951334 1954003 Yo, little Marie. Let there be light.
1965064 1967232 - You like dogs?<br />- Dogs?
1967257 1970009 Dogs. This is, like, a dog pound.
1970034 1971888 It's where they keep...
1972306 1974557 ...a large variety of dogs.
1974582 1980712 I used to come here for sightseein', but,<br />you know, you learn a lot talkin' to dogs.
1980737 1983341 - Really, you do.<br />- Yeah, man.
1984558 1986865 Hey, man, how about this one?
1988553 1990799 He don't look too friendly, my friend.
1990824 1992111 This is the one.
1992135 1993566 Hey, boy, how you doin'?
1993591 1995447 What about this one?
1995471 1997471 - Come here, boy.<br />- Who, him?
1997496 1998744 Yeah, why not?
1998768 2001051 Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
2001076 2002893 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.
2002918 2006754 If you look at it closely,<br />the colour kinda looks like old furniture,
2006779 2009364 like some kinda pirate chest thing<br />goin' on.
2009389 2011943 Yeah, sure, man.<br />Hey, how about a young one?
2012833 2015583 Forget him. Come over here a minute.<br />I want you to see something.
2015608 2019986 Now, you notice what this animal<br />is doin' here, lyin' in that position?
2020326 2021872 He ain't doin' nothin'.
2022127 2024539 He's doin' a lot.<br />He ain't wastin' no energy.
2024564 2025826 Cos he's dead.
2032299 2035050 There's a lot of good mileage<br />left in that animal.
2035075 2039322 Some good food, the addition of a couple<br />of new friends - bingo, he's back.
2039347 2041072 But what do you think's a good name?
2041096 2042766 It's your dog. You name him.
2042791 2045537 Hey, no. It's a community animal.<br />50-50.
2045562 2048177 Look, I don't know much about no dogs.
2048202 2052330 Well, you know, Steps, it ain't that<br />complicated. You pet 'em, you feed 'em,
2052355 2057030 and nature takes its course, you know.<br />Don't you wanna name an animal?
2057055 2061068 I think every guy should one time<br />try to name an animal something.
2061494 2063286 I don't know. Fleabag.
2063621 2067916 It's catchy. You know,<br />it ain't original but it's pretty good.
2067941 2073487 I think you could come up with in your<br />young brain something better than Fleabag.
2074197 2076157 Punchy. How's that?
2077546 2079732 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah, Punchy.
2083767 2085851 - I like it, you know?<br />- For real?
2085936 2089316 For real. Punchy it is.<br />I think Punchy's easy to remember,
2089337 2093552 it's not that hard to spell, and then once<br />it's in your brain you never forget it.
2093567 2094850 Punchy. Very good.
2094874 2095914 All right, man.
2095939 2097342 Good call.
2097366 2098799 All right, Punchy.
2098824 2101095 You ready to be bailed out, my friend?
2101197 2102049 OK.
2104229 2106205 You know I was just joking with you, right?
2106230 2108705 Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.
2143558 2144867 Rocky?
2148605 2149968 Excuse me.
2155689 2157357 - Rock.<br />- Yo, Paulie.
2157382 2160884 Hey, they're gonna be talking<br />about that fake Looney Tune fight.
2160909 2163786 Hey, come on.<br />We're about to serve today's special.
2163972 2167474 Italian food cooked by a bunch of Mexicans<br />ain't so special, Rocko.
2167499 2168898 Hey, yo.
2170726 2173078 Hey, I skipped work for this.
2176249 2178624 What an ugly dog.
2179993 2181734 It's a cute dog.
2183814 2186535 Hey, Rock.<br />I'm gonna take off, all right?
2186560 2188457 That stuff back there is cool.
2188481 2190148 - You like that?<br />- Yeah, man.
2190270 2191435 Thanks. I appreciate it.
2191460 2193484 - I'm gonna catch you later.<br />- All right.
2199072 2201336 - Who's the criminal?<br />- He's a nice kid.
2201361 2202921 He dresses like a bum.
2203472 2206492 Coming from a human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.
2207410 2210335 - Hide the silverware.<br />- That's nice.
2212648 2214226 Hey, Spider.
2218467 2220585 Didn't you knock out that bum once?
2221055 2222499 Will you give it a rest?
2233374 2236835 I'm gonna be late for work for this.<br />Give me a break, huh?
2236945 2239523 All right, just for a few seconds.
2239932 2243633 In the late '60s a simulated fight<br />took place between two legends,
2243658 2246023 Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.
2246035 2247863 Marciano, long retired,
2247888 2250683 and Ali, unable to fight legitimately<br />for three years
2250708 2253393 for refusing induction<br />into the armed forces,
2253418 2256447 was in need of money<br />and agreed to the dream match
2256472 2259149 whose outcome would be decided<br />by a computer.
2259174 2263928 It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano<br />won the much-disputed computer decision
2263953 2266788 and guess what - not much has changed.
2266932 2268842 Last week, Rocky Balboa won...
2268867 2271988 See. That's the cartoon fight<br />I told you about.
2272174 2273457 Yeah.
2274165 2278460 A stunning knockout. And keep in mind<br />this is taking the human factor out of it.
2278485 2281963 - Whoa, that was beautiful.<br />- Rocky Balboa would be triumphant.
2281988 2285449 KO 13, and here's some of the fallout.
2285474 2289477 What started as a form of entertainment<br />has now become this rallying cry
2289502 2293332 for people who think an old-school athlete<br />like Balboa could be better,
2293357 2297103 so computer technology has to create<br />what isn't. That's irresponsible.
2297128 2299129 Get therapy, will you?
2299315 2301863 Skip, how do you think Balboa<br />would do against Dixon?
2301888 2305487 Badly. Personally, I think Balboa<br />was completely overrated.
2305512 2307471 You know he owns a restaurant.
2307511 2309832 What's the specialty? Pounded chicken?
2309857 2312734 I would have paid to see the fight.<br />Next topic, NASCAR,
2312759 2316675 and the controversy that won't go away.<br />Let's go back to Sunday's race.
2317743 2320814 Hey, hey, hey. Cheer up.<br />Free advertisement.
2320839 2322800 Come on. Meat house calls.
2333052 2334735 Yo, Robert.
2337588 2339351 What are you doing out so late?
2339379 2341957 I tried callin' but nothing was pickin' up.
2341982 2343044 Is something wrong?
2343068 2345568 No, no, I just wanted to see you in person.
2345593 2346677 You wanna come inside?
2346701 2349972 I wanna get your opinion on something.
2349997 2351802 Sure. Opinion on what?
2351808 2354077 They say you only go around once, right?
2354102 2356282 - Yeah, I've heard that.<br />- Well...
2356549 2359249 I think I wanna, like, do something.
2359274 2360411 Like what?
2360435 2361602 Fight.
2362921 2366251 You know, nothing big.<br />Small stuff, like locally.
2368462 2371696 Don't you think you're too, you know, old?
2371869 2376567 You think you oughta stop tryin' cos<br />you had too many birthdays? I do not.
2376591 2378101 People'll think you're crazy.
2378126 2382129 What's crazy about standin' toe-to-toe<br />saying, "I am," you know?
2382524 2384368 That's just the ego talkin'.
2385286 2388477 Look, what are you tryin' to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
2389113 2394117 Prove? Listen, I... I stopped thinkin'<br />the way other people think a long time ago.
2394142 2396305 You know, you gotta think like you think.
2397510 2398599 I do.
2398623 2400248 Do you? Good.
2400273 2403484 You gotta... You gotta face reality.
2403509 2406368 OK? It's... it's a different world now.
2406644 2408884 Only the clothes is different.
2411284 2414102 I really don't know what you want from me.
2414829 2419305 I just want us to get involved,<br />you know, like a home team.
2421646 2427150 Look, whatever it is,<br />whatever you're going through, it'll pass.
2427386 2429202 Yeah, you're probably right.
2429227 2432036 Time, it's gonna catch up to all of us.
2432360 2435423 - Especially if you're standin' still.<br />- Hey, come on.
2438353 2440243 Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.
2443777 2446157 - Did you tell this to your kid?<br />- Yeah, I did.
2446182 2448516 - He think you're nuts?<br />- Yeah.
2448667 2454320 Well, he don't believe in you?<br />Welcome to my world, buddy.
2454614 2457866 Rocko, nobody's givin' you no title shot.
2457891 2460350 I know that. I don't want one.
2460375 2462918 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
2464045 2465420 No.
2465782 2468774 You're mad because<br />they took down your statue?
2469339 2470381 No.
2471803 2473493 Not really, no.
2473518 2475290 If it's about money,
2475790 2481946 just hang a sign around your neck saying,<br />"Punch me, $5." You'll make big money.
2483705 2486188 What? You haven't peaked yet?
2486986 2488013 Peaked?
2488044 2489495 Yeah, peaked.
2489942 2492618 I don't know. There's still<br />some stuff in the basement.
2493420 2494567 What basement?
2494591 2495813 In here.
2496954 2498754 Tell me about the stuff.
2499996 2501018 What about it?
2501043 2505000 Tell me about the stuff inside.<br />Is it angry?
2505024 2506229 Angry?
2506340 2508578 Are you mad because Adrian left you?
2508603 2511011 She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
2511036 2513043 OK. OK, OK, OK.
2517350 2521244 You know, some...<br />sometimes it's hard to breathe.
2521480 2525027 You know, I feel, like,<br />this beast inside me.
2525606 2528320 It's OK, Rocko. Please, it's OK.
2528355 2531433 Is it... OK?
2537052 2540763 I... I just never knew<br />it was supposed to be this hard.
2540788 2543246 It wasn't supposed to be like this,<br />Paulie, you know?
2553804 2556089 You wanna come by and help me train?
2556114 2557521 I got a job here.
2557837 2559220 I understand.
2560017 2564767 Remember you said if you stay one place<br />long enough you become that place?
2565038 2567290 Rocko, this is all I got.
2567587 2569955 I understand, Paulie. I do.
2574817 2579041 Well, if you get time and maybe come down<br />and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
2579650 2581267 Of course, Rocko.
2584916 2586462 Bye, Paulie.
2586833 2588478 Goodbye, Rocko.
2591443 2593314 Take care, Rocko.
2599033 2603952 This plenary session of the Pennsylvania<br />Athletic Commission is convened
2603977 2608355 in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa
2608380 2612800 for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing licence
2612825 2617621 due to his ineligibility to be licensed<br />as a matter of right.
2617877 2621803 Mr Balboa, you are welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself,
2621828 2625211 we invite you to make<br />an opening statement if you'd like to.
2625236 2627850 No, I'm just curious how I did, that's all.
2627976 2632647 All right. Well, the medical advisory board<br />has informed us
2632689 2635777 that the tests to which<br />you have been subjected,
2635802 2638761 you've passed these tests<br />with flying colours.
2639267 2642717 - And we congratulate you for that.<br />- Thanks.
2642742 2648895 However, this commission in good conscience<br />cannot recommend you for a licence,
2649236 2652298 and we therefore deny your application.
2653787 2656671 - Didn't I do what you asked?<br />- Yes, you did.
2656696 2658666 So I should get a licence, right?
2658841 2660055 Not exactly.
2662892 2666556 So why'd you give me all them tests<br />if you was never passin' me?
2666767 2669183 We've got to stand by our decision here,
2669208 2672455 and we have to deny your request<br />for a licence at this time.
2684534 2687158 Yo, don't I got some rights?
2687184 2689648 What rights do you think<br />you are referring to?
2689658 2692154 Like in that official paper they wrote.
2692178 2693553 That's the Bill of Rights.
2693566 2696865 Yeah. Don't it say something about<br />goin' after what makes you happy?
2696890 2699679 No, that's the pursuit of happiness.<br />But what's your point?
2699704 2703134 My point is I'm pursuing something<br />and nobody looks happy about it.
2703453 2705679 But we're just looking out<br />for your interests.
2705704 2709582 But maybe you're lookin' out for<br />your interests just a little bit more.
2709809 2713478 You shouldn't ask people to come<br />and pay the freight on somethin',
2713503 2716505 they pay, they're still not good enough.<br />Is that right?
2716672 2720320 Maybe you're doin' your job, but<br />why you gotta stop me from doin' mine?
2720611 2724447 If you're willin' to go through the<br />battling to get to where you wanna get,
2724472 2726389 who's got the right to stop you?
2726414 2730119 Maybe you guys got something<br />you never finished, you really wanna do,
2730144 2734481 you never said to somebody - something!<br />You're told no after you pay your dues.
2734506 2737441 Who's got the right to tell you that?<br />Nobody!
2737443 2739031 It's your right to listen to your gut.
2739047 2744343 It ain't nobody's right to say no after you<br />earned the right to do what you wanna do!
2748389 2752351 You know, the older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.
2752737 2756726 The only thing I'm asking you guys<br />to leave on the table is what's right.
2774605 2776690 Yo! Have you seen the paper today?
2776715 2779200 Front row. Front row.
2779225 2780943 That is so great.
2781458 2784374 - All right, all right.<br />- You know what? Let's go get some food.
2784407 2787122 - Come on, come on. Hey!<br />- Robert, come on.
2788512 2793349 The last pay-per-views were in the toilet.<br />You're not makin' championship money.
2793374 2795500 There's a bunch of nobodies out there.
2795525 2798485 I wanna talk to you about<br />an interesting opportunity.
2798564 2802525 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a licence and got one, yeah?
2802550 2804544 - Yeah. Forget about it.<br />- Hear me out.
2804569 2808156 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands behind my back?
2808181 2811725 Everybody knows you can beat the guy,<br />but that's not what it's about.
2811750 2815170 It's about money making. We gotta<br />capitalise on that computer fight.
2815195 2817943 This could do a million buys.<br />15, 20 million to you.
2817982 2818944 Forget about it.
2818941 2821269 Then what do you wanna do? No one's beating<br />the door down to watch you fight anymore.
2821294 2824060 - Look, man, we got guaranteed fights.<br />- We don't.
2824085 2827592 You wanna do this now, I'll do it now.<br />We got nothing, Mace.
2827617 2831203 All the fights you come up with<br />all got rejected. You know why?
2831228 2835398 They're all bums out there. Nobody cares<br />about them. There's no marquee value.
2835577 2839580 But this Balboa thing is interesting<br />because... Listen to me.
2839605 2843608 It's a has-been-never-gonna-be world.<br />Call it nostalgia if you want,
2843633 2845800 but people can relate to that stuff.
2845825 2848279 - This is a no-lose. It's all good.<br />- Good for who?
2848304 2851473 For you! Not for me, for you!<br />Maybe you don't understand.
2851498 2855167 People don't like you no more.<br />They're not supporting you any more.
2855192 2857109 Don't you understand that?
2857285 2859423 Don't look at me<br />like I'm messin' with your legacy.
2859447 2861538 Every jock thinks they got a legacy.
2861563 2864247 A legacy is what you get instead<br />of getting paid. That's a legacy.
2864278 2866947 - Hey, don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />- I'm not.
2866972 2870718 Everybody knows you could kick<br />this old man's ass, but you don't.
2870743 2874746 You leave him with a bit of dignity.<br />So they say, "Mason's got compassion."
2874771 2879063 "He's a decent guy." You got a whole new<br />audience who'll double your money.
2879087 2881590 Want a new image? That's how you get it.
2881632 2883673 What you mean?<br />To replace the one that you two made?
2883691 2886359 Wait. We made your world green.<br />You made the rest.
2886401 2888340 All this is you.<br />You made all this junk happen.
2888344 2890339 I've had it up to here with this mess, man.
2890364 2892965 It's time we make some changes.<br />I'm goin' back to Martin's gym.
2892989 2894784 All right, we'll talk about this crap.
2894809 2897172 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.
2908072 2910049 - How you doin'?<br />- What a surprise.
2910074 2914809 I was drivin' around the neighbourhood. I<br />thought, "Why not drive by and say hello?"
2914834 2917435 - Do you wanna come inside?<br />- The dog needs exercise.
2917460 2919552 - Do you want to take a walk?<br />- Yeah.
2919577 2922169 - It's nice outside.<br />- All right.
2922334 2925121 - Nice and brisk.<br />- When did you get a dog?
2925146 2927483 We picked up Punchy a couple of days back.
2927508 2930302 Punchy. You named a dog Punchy?
2930362 2934657 - Actually, your kid come up with the name.<br />- Yeah? I think that's disrespectful.
2934742 2936993 No, no, it's fine, really, no.
2937018 2940103 It's easy to remember,<br />and it's all that, you know.
2940128 2943297 What do you think about<br />comin' over to the restaurant?
2943501 2947295 - What for?<br />- Well, you know, for, like... for work.
2947320 2950030 The hostess is gonna be having a kid.<br />You'd do good.
2950055 2952883 - I don't know.<br />- I'm telling you, you'd do good.
2952908 2955779 I appreciate what you're doin' for my kid,<br />but I can't.
2956373 2958416 Hey, listen. I think you'd like it a lot.
2958441 2960836 It's a nice environment.<br />It's very pleasant.
2960861 2962310 Can we drop it?
2965204 2966872 What's botherin' you?
2966897 2969404 Nothin'. It's all right. I gotta get back.
2970676 2972675 - No, it ain't all right.<br />- Oh, come on.
2972839 2973553 What?
2973596 2976007 I'm supposed to be the first person<br />people see and they walk in?
2976032 2979702 Yeah. You just give out menus,<br />say hello, sit people down.
2979727 2982729 Look, little Marie, if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.
2982754 2986173 You could find ten better people,<br />100 better people for this job.
2986419 2988304 Give it a try. Like, two weeks.
2988328 2989792 I don't wanna try.
2990321 2992852 - Who put this stuff in your head?<br />- Nobody.
2992877 2995073 Well, it just don't get in there by itself.
2998346 2999940 Thanks for comin' by.
3002101 3006229 Yo. When was the last time<br />you went dancin'? Has it been a while?
3006771 3007976 Why are you askin'?
3008000 3011695 Cos you're dancin' around these problems,<br />you might as well dance with me.
3011719 3015338 I ain't that good,<br />but I'm better than the average bear.
3015363 3017620 And where that came from, I don't know.
3018758 3019676 You're crazy.
3019701 3022417 Yeah, a little bit. But the way<br />you're thinkin', the way you're talkin',
3022441 3024139 it's a little crazy too.
3024686 3028250 Come on. You deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
3028275 3031967 I need you to class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
3032964 3036651 And if you say, "Screw you, creepo," again<br />I totally understand,
3036676 3041263 but I warn you, I'm gonna put myself, like,<br />geographically in the middle of the street
3041288 3044416 and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />wave to the first bus and say:
3044458 3049063 "Come over here and mash me, cos Marie<br />turned down the job at the restaurant."
3049088 3050979 "She thinks she's better than us."
3051003 3054676 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
3054783 3056733 - Yeah?<br />- No.
3058969 3060694 That was a close call.
3061559 3063147 Listen, seriously.
3064270 3066334 Come on over. It'll be nice.
3069267 3070490 All right.
3088961 3090090 Paulie!
3093695 3095426 Sorry, Paulie.
3096956 3098214 Sorry.
3129947 3132837 How are you? Get my unusual up there.
3133232 3136192 Excuse me. Deliveries are in the back.
3136344 3138122 I'm not a delivery guy.
3138147 3140011 Well, do you have a reservation?
3140036 3142236 Do I look like a freakin' Indian?
3145893 3147704 Hey, Rock. Rocky?
3152775 3155814 I think we got a little bit of a problem<br />with this guy.
3155839 3158236 A problem? No, no, he's just a relative.
3158450 3160165 Oh. OK.
3163357 3164482 Yo, Paulie.
3166974 3169159 - What happened to your eye?<br />- I hit it.
3169184 3171158 - Why?<br />- Needed to.
3171811 3173216 What happened?
3173240 3174688 I'm celebratin', Rock.
3174713 3177048 - Why?<br />- I retired.
3177609 3178665 Retired?
3179718 3180868 Yeah?
3184390 3188519 So when'd they start giving retired people<br />meat instead of watches, Paulie?
3192168 3193886 I don't need a watch.
3195713 3197284 I got a watch!
3197668 3199398 You gave me a watch!
3199422 3200545 Paulie...
3200968 3203214 I don't need a goddamn watch.
3205119 3207698 - Yo, Paulie.<br />- I got a watch!
3209623 3211624 I got two watches!
3212126 3213753 Yo, Paulie!
3226485 3227766 Yo, Paulie.
3229244 3230141 Rock.
3231196 3235483 It takes guts to climb back in that ring<br />knowin' you're gonna take a beating.
3238253 3240330 You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
3240354 3241897 How do you know that?
3243613 3245584 The stuff in the basement.
3257004 3258418 Thanks, Paulie.
3263636 3264840 OK?
3267908 3270159 - You OK?<br />- Yeah, yeah. Good. How are you?
3270184 3272219 Oh, yeah, fine. This is great.
3272243 3274771 Listen. Some guys over there<br />wanna talk to you.
3274796 3276472 - OK.<br />- OK?
3281122 3283790 - Thanks for comin' by.<br />- No problem. Our pleasure.
3283822 3285219 You wanna hear some stories?
3285243 3286347 What kind of stories?
3286372 3289070 A lot of people like to hear fight stories.
3289094 3290596 - Maybe later.<br />- OK.
3290621 3294730 I'm Lou DiBella. This is LC Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixon's manager.
3295049 3297269 - Will you sit down and join us?<br />- Sure.
3299564 3303699 We have the promotional contract for<br />Mason Dixon - who's a big fan, by the way.
3304009 3306460 When he heard<br />you were interested in fighting again,
3306485 3308761 he thought,<br />why not try and work something out?
3308785 3312046 Like a special event,<br />a first-class exhibition fight.
3313119 3315585 - Why me?<br />- He respects the hell outta you.
3315604 3319300 And let's be honest.<br />That computer fight got people curious.
3319324 3320976 This could be very interesting.
3321001 3324599 But I ain't interested in getting<br />mangled and embarrassed.
3324624 3326715 No, that's not gonna happen. Never.
3326743 3333249 Truthfully, I was thinkin' more on a, like,<br />minuscule small level.
3333274 3336193 You know, small fights.<br />Not big fights. Small fights.
3336218 3339387 Things that... Local.<br />You know what I mean? Not...
3339412 3341663 Not a bad idea.<br />But don't think of it as big.
3341688 3345149 Think of it like an exhibition,<br />as a glorified sparring session.
3345174 3349077 And here's something you'll like - we'll<br />donate a portion of the gate to charity.
3349541 3351960 - Well, that's always nice.<br />- It's good to give.
3353767 3356232 - Where is it taking place?<br />- Las Vegas.
3356257 3359796 Las Vegas. Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killin' you.
3360333 3361333 A little stiff.
3361358 3363919 - You move better when you're warmer.<br />- Yeah.
3363944 3366647 And if nothing else,<br />you'll have new stories to tell.
3367674 3370634 - I really gotta think about this.<br />- Absolutely.
3370659 3373257 - Is that OK?<br />- I understand. No problem.
3373429 3376765 - I'm gonna go. You can order something.<br />- What do you recommend?
3376790 3378249 It's all edible.
3380531 3382741 OK. Thanks.
3384024 3387818 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime.
3387843 3389635 - He'd kill him.<br />- No kiddin'.
3390971 3392632 Man, I'm confused.
3400624 3404811 - I didn't think this would come along.<br />- But this is what you wanted, right?
3405390 3409089 You know, I talk and I talk and sometimes<br />I think what I'm saying is true,
3409114 3413635 and then, you know, I look at myself<br />and I'm not even sure what is true any more
3413660 3418498 cos it's like I push this crazy idea about<br />fightin'... I mean, what's it all about?
3418540 3421626 Do I care about standin' toe-to-toe<br />and all that stuff?
3421651 3425362 Or like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?
3425509 3429345 Or am I this old pug who's just tryin'<br />to replace old pain with new pain?
3429370 3432068 I don't know. I-I don't know.
3433824 3436482 Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.
3436868 3440717 I'm always listenin' and lookin' and...
3441039 3445209 But, you know, who you are, you know,<br />the part of you that's so full of life,
3445233 3448323 I mean, we all have that feeling,<br />that fire,
3448348 3452490 but we usually never get a chance to use it<br />and then it just goes away.
3453052 3456804 But you can.<br />You've got this opportunity, so do it.
3456829 3462333 Why not? I mean, this is who you are,<br />you know? This is who you'll always be.
3462598 3466021 And you don't move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.
3466046 3469083 And it doesn't matter<br />how this looks to other people.
3469108 3471356 All that matters is how it looks to you.
3473418 3474356 Rocky.
3476051 3477293 Rocky, look at me.
3479245 3482504 How it looks to you.
3483772 3488067 And if this is something that you wanna do<br />and if this is something that you gotta do,
3488092 3489583 then you do it.
3491405 3492918 Fighters fight.
3496827 3498778 You're not gonna punch me, are you?
3502791 3506754 All right, listen. I gotta go before I wear<br />out my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
3508005 3509254 Thanks.
3520017 3521932 Fighters fight, right?
3528585 3532462 It's rare when you get to promote an event<br />that's bigger than boxing. This is.
3532631 3536592 Skill versus will,<br />with part of the proceeds going to charity.
3536617 3540912 The brainchild of Mason Dixon,<br />to honour past heavyweight champions.
3540937 3544627 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
3545728 3549938 A few great fighters have fought<br />in their 50s with disastrous results.
3549963 3554342 Why risk the danger and embarrassment?<br />The smart money says you have no chance.
3554367 3558905 A puncher always has a chance.<br />This fight will be competitive.
3559806 3561686 Why are you doing this, Rocky?
3562104 3566357 I don't know. I'd rather do something<br />I love badly than...
3566396 3570496 Than... Than to feel bad by<br />not doin' something you love.
3571844 3574471 Rocky, the press has labelled you<br />a Balboasaurus.
3575840 3577902 How do you feel about that?
3577927 3582346 Mason, say the following happens.<br />You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
3582371 3585731 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
3585960 3588170 You all know that'd never happen.
3588335 3589693 This is only an exhibition.
3589717 3592400 Don't go tryin' to make more of this<br />than that computer tried.
3594739 3597689 Isn't this sport in enough trouble<br />without circus events?
3598457 3599705 Next question.
3600393 3604563 This looks like a cheap bit of ring theatre<br />between a has-been
3604588 3608121 and a man whose own credible legacy<br />and popularity is in doubt.
3608146 3610898 - What's the upside?<br />- Doubt? Upside?
3610923 3613892 I mean... What do you mean, upside?
3613917 3616103 I mean, what do I have to do?
3617596 3621098 I'm 33 and 0, with 30 knockouts.<br />I'm doin' you people a favour.
3621123 3625244 I'm havin' this exhibition for you,<br />and you gonna make a mockery out of me?
3625269 3628980 I'm the champ. I mean,<br />I get pissed, this guy get hurt.
3629710 3631627 See you at the fight.
3635716 3637800 The guy's a joke. He's gonna get crushed.
3646911 3648704 Oh, look who's here.
3648729 3650835 How you doin'? Have you seen my father?
3650859 3652362 He's in the back.
3652899 3654987 We've never served this many meals.
3655178 3658956 And you're doin' good?<br />You're enjoyin' everything, right?
3661301 3662761 Excuse me.
3664596 3666167 How you doin'?
3666868 3668401 Glad you come by.
3668815 3670087 Can I talk with you?
3670112 3672472 - Sure.<br />- Can we do it outside?
3677442 3680569 - You're going through with this?<br />- I start training tomorrow.
3680594 3683846 Hey, Rock. I made some connections.
3683871 3686565 I can make some money on this.<br />Endorsements.
3687559 3689015 Absolutely. Do that.
3689039 3690503 - Thank you.<br />- Sure.
3692259 3695678 - So you nervous about the fight?<br />- Yeah, scared to death.
3695752 3698587 - You don't look scared.<br />- Well, I ain't supposed to.
3698612 3700925 Then you don't have to do it.
3701097 3703265 Yeah, well, I think I do.
3706637 3709931 You know, living with you,<br />it hasn't been easy.
3709956 3712744 People see me but they think of you.
3712769 3715720 With this going on,<br />it's gonna be worse than ever.
3715754 3717853 - It don't have to be.<br />- Sure it does.
3717885 3720714 - Why? You got a lot goin' on, kid.<br />- What, my last name?
3721009 3725220 That's the reason I got a decent job,<br />why people deal with me in the first place.
3725245 3729706 Now I start to get a little ahead,<br />to get a little something for myself,
3729730 3731039 and this happens.
3731230 3734956 Now, I'm asking you as a favour<br />not to go through with this, OK?
3734981 3737936 This is only gonna end up<br />bad for you and bad for me.
3737961 3740796 - You think I'm hurtin' you?<br />- Yeah. In a way you are.
3741331 3744800 - It's the last thing I ever wanted to do.<br />- I know that's not what you wanna do,
3744825 3748327 but that's just the way that it is.<br />Don't you care what people think?
3748352 3751355 Doesn't it bother you that<br />people make you out to be a joke
3751376 3754722 and I'll be included in that?<br />Do you think that's right?
3755168 3756401 Do you?
3762235 3764175 You ain't gonna believe this,
3764904 3767190 but you used to fit right here.
3767407 3769658 I'd hold you up and say to your mother:
3769683 3772429 "This kid's gonna be the best kid<br />in the world."
3772454 3775831 "This kid's gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew."
3775856 3778852 And you grew up good and wonderful.
3778877 3781987 It was great just watching.<br />Every day was like a privilege.
3782297 3786425 Then the time come for you to be your own<br />man and take on the world, and you did.
3786450 3791495 But somewhere along the line,<br />you changed. You stopped bein' you.
3791520 3795064 You let people stick a finger in your face<br />and tell you you're no good,
3795089 3798895 and when things got hard, you started<br />lookin' for somethin' to blame.
3798920 3800636 Like a big shadow.
3802590 3807487 I'll tell you something you already know.<br />The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
3807512 3811390 It's a very mean and nasty place.<br />And I don't care how tough you are,
3811415 3815502 it will beat you to your knees and<br />keep you there permanently if you let it.
3815747 3819875 You, me, or nobody<br />is gonna hit as hard as life.
3819900 3822026 But it ain't about how hard you hit.
3822051 3825721 It's about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep movin' forward.
3825746 3828998 How much you can take<br />and keep movin' forward.
3829239 3831159 That's how winnin' is done!
3832097 3834890 If you know what you're worth,<br />get what you're worth,
3834915 3838334 but you gotta be willin' to take the hits<br />and not pointin' fingers,
3838359 3842647 sayin' you ain't where you wanna be<br />because of him or her or anybody!
3842672 3846651 Cowards do that, and that ain't you!<br />You're better than that!
3853670 3858628 I'm always gonna love you no matter what,<br />no matter what happens.
3859224 3861565 You're my son and you're my blood.
3862484 3864596 You're the best thing in my life.
3866321 3870362 But until you start believin' in yourself,<br />you ain't gonna have a life.
3875119 3877190 Don't forget to visit your mother.
3927465 3929685 - Yeah, those are beautiful.<br />- Yeah.
3931965 3934966 - You get off early from work?<br />- No.
3935640 3938544 I left. I quit.
3940037 3941474 Quit? Why?
3942689 3944794 I wasn't very...
3945692 3948982 I don't know. I just...<br />I didn't... I didn't fit in there.
3950864 3952239 I understand.
3956953 3958626 So what are you gonna do?
3958650 3959966 Right now?
3961528 3963700 Right now I'd rather be with you.
3966713 3967997 That all right?
3970050 3971177 Yeah.
3971877 3974513 It's been a long time<br />since I've seen a fight.
3986733 3992237 You know all about fightin' so there's<br />no sense us goin' down that road again.
3992262 3995200 To beat this guy, you need speed.
3995325 3996654 You don't have it.
3998126 4001997 And your knees can't take the poundin',<br />so hard runnin' is out.
4002022 4004142 And you got arthritis in your neck,
4004167 4007836 and you've got calcium deposits<br />on most of your joints,
4007861 4009544 so sparrin' is out.
4010120 4011747 I had that problem.
4012763 4017934 So what we'll be callin' on<br />is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.
4017948 4022827 Horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron,<br />pile-drivin' punches
4022852 4026216 that will have to hurt so much<br />they'll rattle his ancestors.
4026401 4028044 Every time you hit him with a shot,
4028403 4031654 it's gotta feel like<br />he tried kissin' the express train.
4032700 4036646 Yeah! Let's start buildin'<br />some hurtin' bombs.
4068690 4071453 - You'll get it. You'll get it.<br />- You can do it, Rocko.
4107520 4109304 Gettin' stronger!
4127081 4128392 Come on, Rocko!
4136049 4138258 Come on, come on. There you go.
4138283 4139658 There you go.
4143723 4145072 You can do it, Rocko.
4148269 4149767 Gettin' stronger!
4151439 4152648 Three.
4152673 4154181 Four. Five.
4187600 4188642 Yeah!
4198945 4202430 Rocky Balboa, 217.
4203800 4209641 The undisputed heavyweight<br />champion Mason Dixon, 221.
4212792 4215391 Thank you very much.<br />I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
4232257 4234341 - You know how much money is in this?<br />- A lot.
4234366 4236672 Imagine tryin' to clean this place.
4237068 4238719 - No, seriously.<br />- Balboa.
4242172 4244966 You guys,<br />I'll catch up with you all later, OK?
4244991 4246907 Robert, I want you to hang with me.
4248578 4250883 - How you doin', champ?<br />- I'm good.
4252832 4255547 There's no reason for neither one of us<br />to get hurt.
4255563 4260376 I'll do my best to carry you, make sure<br />you save face. There'd be no embarrassment.
4260808 4263810 But I promise you, if you try to press me,
4263835 4269063 you hit me, you hurt me, you hit me low,<br />cheap-shot me, I'll get you outta there.
4270152 4274513 You know, a lot of people<br />come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
4274538 4276067 It's already over.
4276091 4277999 Ain't nothin' over till it's over.
4278211 4280059 What's that from? The '80s?
4280083 4281977 That's probably the '70s.
4285254 4286883 Just remember what I said.
4288039 4289805 Hey, yo, champ.
4290429 4292430 Yo, ain't you a little scared?
4293020 4294896 I don't get scared.
4298048 4304262 I think you try a little harder when you're<br />scared. This is what has worked for me.
4305067 4307402 - I ain't scared.<br />- You ain't scared of me?
4307427 4311644 Come on, let's see what you got.<br />Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
4327153 4328504 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
4329218 4331886 - I hope I didn't wake you.<br />- No. You wanna come in?
4331911 4333412 No. It's OK.
4333437 4338650 I just wanted to - I don't know - come by<br />and wish you good luck for tomorrow.
4338675 4342168 - Thanks.<br />- Yeah. Um... I brought you something.
4342755 4345379 I hope you don't mind.<br />I took it from the restaurant.
4347207 4348762 Adrian.
4349238 4352073 Yeah. I thought she would<br />keep you safe, you know.
4352098 4354602 Yeah, she always brought me luck.
4354626 4355887 Yeah.
4357207 4362050 Yeah. Listen, I wanted to say thanks for<br />everything you've done for me and my kid.
4363103 4364895 You've been great.
4369201 4371011 You know, tomorrow,
4372760 4376128 you're gonna prove that the last thing<br />to age in somebody is their heart.
4378893 4381089 - I'll try.<br />- You go show 'em.
4381114 4382323 Thank you.
4403862 4407948 The heavyweight championship<br />has been one of sport's most coveted titles
4407973 4409698 for 120 years.
4409723 4413643 Two-time heavyweight champion<br />Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia slugger,
4413668 4418808 renowned for his cast-iron jaw,<br />ferocious body attack and will of steel,
4418831 4422673 which have carried the smaller fighter<br />to numerous victories over the years
4422710 4425504 against physically superior opponents.
4425529 4428565 And Mason Dixon,<br />the current heavyweight title holder,
4428590 4431801 with all the speed and determination<br />any fighter could want.
4431826 4435954 But many still question whether<br />he has the heart of a true champion,
4435979 4439925 never having been pushed to go<br />the distance. Tonight, we find out.
4440764 4444099 We're at the Mandalay Bay Events Center<br />in Las Vegas, Nevada,
4444124 4448315 for the much-anticipated showdown<br />between Mason "The Line" Dixon
4448340 4451308 and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
4451746 4454540 I'm Jim Lampley, with Larry Merchant<br />and Max Kellerman,
4454565 4456816 live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel,<br />Las Vegas,
4456827 4461670 where we anticipate one of the most<br />compelling events in boxing history -
4461695 4465365 the current unappreciated<br />heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon,
4465390 4467378 putting his reputation on the line
4467403 4471448 against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion,<br />Rocky Balboa.
4471467 4474987 Even though most see this<br />as a glorified sparring session,
4475012 4477013 the energy in the room is electric.
4477038 4479248 Larry, why is this billed as an exhibition?
4479273 4483222 A wild guess - so they wouldn't<br />have to call it an execution.
4484313 4491069 Zechariah 4:6 says, "It is not by strength,<br />not by might, but by his Spirit."
4491094 4495815 We have already claimed the victory<br />in our Lord Jesus Christ.
4496909 4498690 Good luck, Rocky.
4498715 4500964 Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.
4512359 4516571 Nobody's expecting much, I think,<br />from the way-past-his-prime former champ
4516596 4517762 Rocky Balboa.
4518264 4520938 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
4522268 4528508 Look. Look, I know you got a lot of stuff<br />you gotta get out of your system, huh?
4528964 4531377 Tonight you do it. Right?
4531402 4536615 Get rid of the damn beast.<br />Let it be done once and for all.
4536640 4538360 Please, I love you.
4547793 4551686 There go the lights. The buzz is building<br />toward a roaring crescendo.
4568317 4570100 Where'd that come from?
4570650 4573389 I chose it. I love Sinatra.
4574023 4576037 He's very good, Sinatra.
4576489 4578553 - Let's go.<br />- Very good.
4581369 4586248 And here comes Rocky Balboa,<br />a veteran of the wars,
4586273 4589143 here for one more last hurrah.
4589168 4592006 Or the Last Supper,<br />with him as the main course.
4592268 4595107 What's that music? You can't be serious.
4595132 4598009 "High Hopes"? Talk about wishful thinking.
4598034 4602204 Maybe "no hopes" is more realistic.<br />Anyway, the crowd likes it.
4602229 4605701 Look at the Italian Stallion!<br />Cool and relaxed.
4605726 4609521 Rocky's an off-the-board underdog<br />and they don't care at all.
4609546 4613675 This is about his pride<br />and dignity and his punch, guys.
4613700 4618975 The last thing to go is a guy's punch.<br />Rocky always has that puncher's chance.
4624036 4628337 Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,<br />the people's champion.
4628362 4632740 Prediction - for two rounds,<br />Dixon's gonna have his hands full.
4632765 4637264 Two whole rounds?<br />We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.
4638050 4641240 - How you doin'?<br />- The crowd wants to see something real.
4641595 4646433 Jim, Rocky Balboa just asked me how I'm<br />doing. Now, I grew up watching this guy.
4646458 4649126 I never thought<br />I'd be calling one of his fights.
4649151 4651819 This is unbelievable.<br />I'm a fan. I can't help it.
4651978 4654154 Now here comes Mason Dixon.
4688965 4691746 Dixon establishing<br />his presence in the ring,
4691771 4695053 and suddenly now a conversation<br />breaking out at the ringside.
4695542 4698294 Mike Tyson calling out<br />Mason "The Line" Dixon.
4698319 4700895 You can't call the shots. I'm the champ.
4700919 4703125 You're not doin' nothin'. This is charity!
4703792 4706703 And you got that...<br />you got that midget with you right there.
4711426 4713177 Ladies and gentlemen,
4713202 4719130 welcome to the Mandalay Bay Resort<br />and Casino of Las Vegas,
4719155 4726137 and a special main event of the evening,<br />ten rounds of heavyweight excitement
4726162 4728914 sanctioned by<br />the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
4728939 4734444 And when the bell rings, the referee<br />in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
4734469 4741694 And now, for the thousands in attendance<br />and the millions watching around the world,
4741719 4750519 ladies and gentlemen,<br />let's get ready to rumble!
4751789 4756632 Introducing first, fighting out of<br />the blue corner, wearing black with gold,
4756657 4759951 official weight 217lb.
4759976 4762853 His professional record: 57 victories,
4762878 4767988 including 54 knockouts,<br />with 23 defeats and one draw.
4768013 4771349 He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,
4771374 4775878 the two-time heavyweight champion<br />of the world,
4775903 4778071 "The Italian Stallion"
4778096 4783212 Rocky
4783237 4785269 Balboa!
4788221 4790246 I hope he gets his head busted.
4792063 4793605 Shut up.
4796792 4801212 Across the ring, fighting out of<br />the red corner, wearing white with blue,
4801237 4803816 official weight 221 lb.
4803841 4806050 He has a perfect professional record,
4806075 4812366 consisting of 33 bouts, 33 victories,<br />including 30 knockouts.
4812391 4817604 Originally from Tampa, Florida,<br />but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,
4817629 4825236 the reigning, undisputed, undefeated<br />heavyweight champion of the world
4825261 4832722 Mason "The Line" Dixon!
4837124 4838644 All right, gentlemen.
4838938 4842480 All right, Mason, Rocky. We went over<br />the rules in the dressing room.
4842505 4844088 I expect a good, clean fight.
4844089 4848682 Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,<br />those low blows. Be careful with those.
4848719 4852589 Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.<br />Remember, I'm fair but I'm firm.
4852603 4853778 Touch 'em up.
4853891 4857774 Enjoy the ride. The champ is not<br />in the best shape we've seen him in.
4857811 4860104 Maybe he just plans to phone this one in<br />and go home early.
4860129 4861476 That wouldn't be a surprise.
4861500 4862666 Love you.
4862691 4865485 One thing about Rocky<br />we know for sure,
4865510 4868011 this guy's showing up in shape.
4868036 4871152 - The old man's crazy.<br />- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
4871177 4874637 You just take it easy.<br />This is an exhibition. Do it to him.
4874662 4876246 Three rounds to set a pace.
4876251 4878687 - Every time you hit him, make a dent.<br />- Got it.
4878712 4883508 The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight?<br />I can't believe it's here.
4884750 4889921 Round one begins. If old George Foreman<br />shocked the world with one punch,
4889946 4892279 why can't old Rocky Balboa?
4892304 4894931 As much excitement<br />as there is in the arena,
4894956 4897324 there's a sense of foreboding as well.
4901664 4905292 And now Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />goes to work with his jab,
4905317 4909397 as though he's fighting the number one<br />challenger in the heavyweight division.
4909422 4911757 This is to be expected early on.
4911782 4913988 You knew the champ was gonna<br />control the distance
4914013 4916222 with his jab, his height, his range.
4917886 4921308 Balboa, looking to get in a shot,<br />misses wildly!
4921333 4922707 Did you like that?
4923770 4927106 It looks like a speed bag<br />against a punching bag.
4927131 4931050 Rocky's frustrated - he came out<br />of retirement to get into a fight.
4931075 4935823 Guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed<br />with. One punch could turn it around.
4935848 4939292 Apparently he forgot his arthritis meds<br />this morning.
4939317 4941026 Rocky misses!
4941370 4944535 There's a meat-seeking missile<br />on the point of the chin by the champ.
4944884 4947277 More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.
4947886 4951297 There's a hard right hand,<br />a left and a right by Balboa.
4951322 4954535 He drives Dixon into the ropes<br />with a series of shots.
4954733 4956746 And the crowd goes berserk.
4961761 4966550 Dixon punishing Balboa for<br />the temerity of landing those shots.
4969632 4973574 It's toe-to-toe in the corner,<br />Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
4981059 4985831 Balboa landing potent combinations to the<br />champion's head. A wake-up call for Dixon.
4985856 4987269 - You all right?<br />- Yeah.
4987274 4988989 - Sit down.<br />- He's got bricks in his glove.
4989008 4991676 - What happened to the angry stuff?<br />- It's still there.
4991701 4994590 Yeah, well, he came to battle, OK?<br />Listen to me.
4994615 4997316 If there's any bone in your body<br />he can break, he's gonna do it.
4997743 4999699 - Give the man a little respect.<br />- What about my respect?
4999724 5002643 Compubox numbers<br />tell the grisly story here.
5002668 5005962 Balboa landed nine of 13 punches<br />in that round.
5005987 5011199 Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.
5011224 5012391 Listen to me.
5012416 5015001 Rocky's been here a million times before -
5015026 5019362 coming out to start another round after<br />he took a beating in the previous one.
5019387 5021636 I warned him. I warned him.
5022548 5027527 Well, he's tired.<br />His legs are going fast or already gone.
5027552 5032419 And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it!
5032444 5036948 The boxing commission, which, remember,<br />was criticised for licensing him,
5036973 5041393 would be massacred<br />if something happened to Rocky.
5045061 5047184 A monstrous straight left hand!
5047209 5050461 Down goes Rocky,<br />and that could be the end of the fight.
5050486 5054322 That could be the exhibition right there.<br />But no, Balboa up,
5054341 5058946 as referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue and Rocky says yes.
5058971 5061889 Even Balboa can be too brave<br />for his own good.
5061914 5065875 Dixon comes right back to try to finish it.<br />Balboa almost went down.
5065900 5068072 Rocky shoves Dixon back.
5068097 5070473 As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
5070498 5071790 Cover up!
5071815 5076235 Open shots at close range,<br />right and left hands, and down goes Balboa,
5076260 5079388 perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career.
5079413 5082957 - That should do it.<br />- Three! Four! Five!
5083052 5084385 Six! Seven!
5084410 5087027 - Get up! Get up!<br />- Eight!
5087626 5088722 Nine!
5089425 5091061 How do you feel? You OK?
5091086 5095965 Now Rocky, furious with himself,<br />convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.
5095990 5099909 Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,<br />Rocky saying he's fine.
5099934 5102222 - He wants to go on.<br />- Let it go! Let it go!
5103033 5106368 And Balboa comes back<br />with a left and a right,
5106393 5110113 and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row.
5111958 5115669 Back comes Dixon with brutal<br />left-hand shots. Dixon hurt his hand!
5115694 5118496 - Go after him!<br />- This is Rocky's best chance.
5118521 5121023 The champ just hurt his hand<br />on Rocky's hip.
5121048 5124718 Balboa immediately going to work<br />to the body. Huge right hook.
5124948 5127783 Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body.
5127808 5129511 These are big punches.
5133796 5135004 Yes!
5137400 5141904 Rocky Balboa has knocked<br />the reigning heavyweight champion down!
5141929 5143262 You hurt him!
5143287 5148417 Mason Dixon has never taken this kind<br />of punishment in his entire career.
5148442 5152706 Maybe he's clearing his head, but<br />the body shots really caved in his ribs.
5152731 5155733 Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
5155758 5159177 Another counter hook by Balboa.<br />Followed by two more!
5159202 5162204 Dixon fires back his own hooks.<br />Now Rocky's stunned.
5162229 5164718 It's an all-out war along the ropes,
5164743 5169566 as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring.
5170243 5171911 Incredible.
5172104 5173503 Yeah, all right!
5174169 5176230 Welcome to Rockyland.
5179830 5181808 - How's the hand?<br />- My hand's broken.
5184533 5186701 If we lose, it's your ass. Your ass!
5186726 5189488 It'll numb up on you.<br />It'll numb up in three rounds.
5189513 5192955 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon's gonna be able to throw it hard.
5192985 5194976 Until then, here's Rocky's chance.
5195000 5196988 Take it to him! No reverse!
5197163 5198722 Take the pain, champ.
5199176 5202894 Everybody thought this was a joke,<br />including me. Now nobody's laughing!
5202919 5205449 You go get him! Go out strong!
5218544 5219863 Keep him off you.
5223296 5224894 That's it! That's it!
5238823 5241199 You won that round. Break him down.
5246491 5248082 Bomb him! Bomb him!
5254499 5255519 Yeah!
5259338 5261128 Just keep throwin' them bombs.
5273294 5274377 Come on.
5282115 5283152 You can do this.
5285186 5287214 Rocky! Rocky!
5296458 5298066 Get him! Go!
5355816 5357915 Go through him. Run over him.
5373243 5374743 Unload on him!
5376337 5377595 Dig down, Mason!
5389014 5391255 They're leaving nothing on the table.
5391284 5393230 The fans are still standing.
5393393 5395949 They may not be able to sit down<br />for a week.
5395974 5398851 - You're doin' great.<br />- I'm doin' better than I thought.
5399023 5400643 Are you sure he's OK?
5400667 5402084 I've had worse.
5402814 5406793 Toe-to-toe, one round to go.<br />Who would have believed this was possible?
5406818 5408081 Can you see outta that eye?
5408105 5408815 Let me talk. Let me talk.
5408839 5409855 Look at me. Look at me.
5409880 5413459 Don't take any more chances out there than<br />you have to. There's nothing more to prove.
5413499 5415054 There's nothing more to prove.
5415079 5417120 I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
5417144 5418795 You can do it, Rocko!
5418820 5421475 - One more round, we go home.<br />- OK, then do it.
5421500 5427254 There's a saying that every great champion<br />has one great fight left in him,
5427279 5430531 and Rocky is proving it so far.
5430722 5432180 Come on. Touch 'em up.
5432204 5435774 Rocko! The last round of your life!<br />The last round!
5435806 5438394 Come on. Touch 'em up.<br />Let's go. Touch 'em up.
5438993 5441668 - You're one crazy old man.<br />- You'll get there.
5442354 5443354 Let's go.
5443980 5448484 Tenth round of a scheduled ten.<br />Who would have dreamed that Rocky Balboa
5448509 5453471 would still be in this "exhibition" against<br />the heavyweight champion of the world?
5453496 5454966 You can do it! Come on!
5454991 5458997 This fight is as though Dixon<br />got on-the-job training in courage.
5460372 5461783 Cover up! Cover up!
5461807 5463290 They're both in a pain-free zone.
5463315 5466370 These guys are fighting<br />in another dimension now.
5466395 5470779 Beyond belief! Balboa just walking<br />straight into Dixon's punches.
5471174 5473380 Target practice for Dixon.
5477072 5480700 They're exchanging right hooks.<br />Here comes Dixon!
5480725 5483583 He's exhausted from punching the man.
5484729 5486730 Knock this bum out, Mace!
5498892 5502936 <i>What is it you said to the kid?<br />It ain't about how hard you hit.</i>
5502961 5506534 <i>It's about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep movin' forward.</i>
5507240 5510847 <i>How much you can take<br />and keep movin' forward.</i>
5512105 5513119 <i>Get up.</i>
5513143 5514623 Let's go! Get up!
5515218 5518053 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5518078 5519256 <i>Get up.</i>
5522434 5524602 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5541054 5545599 Another monster body shot.<br />Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.
5545624 5547338 Start movin' those hands!
5547362 5551771 Less than two minutes to go.<br />The crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.
5551796 5554673 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Turn it over! All the way through!
5554698 5556982 ...and retaliates with fury!
5559763 5561193 Chop him down!
5564643 5566477 Come on, Rocky! Come on!
5568772 5570404 Take him out now!
5571626 5573668 They're trading shots again.
5573832 5577092 Balboa's trying to hit anything<br />and anywhere!
5579616 5581177 Win it! Win it!
5589584 5590646 Yes!
5600405 5603365 - You're a great champion. You got heart.<br />- Thanks.
5603390 5605836 Thanks for the opportunity. Good man.
5608329 5610976 That was unbelievable.<br />That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
5613381 5615992 That's the kind of pride<br />you're talking about.
5617880 5619133 Hey, Paulie.
5619924 5622926 The beast is gone now. The beast is out.
5622951 5626835 One of the most overused words in sports,<br />guys, is "incredible".
5626871 5631039 I hate to say it, this is incredible.
5632711 5634133 Let's go!
5637076 5640860 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />before we go to the score cards,
5640885 5646203 a round of applause for<br />these two heavyweight warriors.
5651438 5654961 We have a split decision.
5658069 5664195 Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94 Dixon.
5666205 5671898 Chuck Giampa has it 95-94 Balboa.
5679966 5685095 And Bill Graham scores it 95-94
5685120 5687866 for the winner by split decision,
5687891 5690351 and still undefeated,
5690376 5698374 the heavyweight champion of the world<br />Mason "The Line" Dixon!
5756287 5758854 You know I couldn't have done nothin'<br />without you.
5761673 5763924 Yo, Adrian, we did it.
5771349 5772979 We did it.
