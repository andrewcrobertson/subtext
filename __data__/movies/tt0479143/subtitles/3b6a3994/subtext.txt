107507 110943 Yet another quick knockout for<br />Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.
111144 113169 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
113346 116338 Hide the women and children.<br />This could get ugly.
116516 120646 This crowd does nothing to hide<br />its anger over this latest debacle.
121054 123887 The fans are mad as hell.<br />They don't want to take it anymore.
124090 126991 They seem to be blaming Dixon,<br />a good fighter, for the decline...
127160 131426 ...not only of the heavyweight-division<br />guys, but of the entire sport.
131598 133031 They're actually pelting...
133199 136760 ...the undefeated heavyweight<br />champion of the world with ice.
136936 140633 Maybe this angry, visceral reaction<br />will pressure Dixon to fight someone...
140807 143742 ...who can fight back for a change.<br />If there' somebody out there.
143910 149143 All of boxing is hoping for a warrior<br />who thrills us with his passion.
297230 299323 Time goes by too fast.
299499 302764 Yeah? Not fast enough.
302935 305165 - Your kid should've been here.<br />- That's all right.
305338 308739 - No, it ain't all right.<br />- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
308941 310602 He don't get that busy.
310910 315040 Let's not talk about it here, okay?<br />You're coming tonight, right?
315248 318945 I'm working. I took the tour<br />the last three years.
319118 321211 I know, but it's the anniversary.
321387 323014 Fine. You got my word.
323189 327649 I appreciate it, thank you.<br />I owe you, Paulie.
359225 362388 Yo, Robert. What's going on?<br />Where have you been? You're late.
364197 366859 No. I don't wanna hear this.<br />Look, your job performance...
367033 370002 ...is nowhere near good enough<br />to be pulling this.
370169 373161 I don't give a damn who your father is.<br />You understand me?
373339 375603 - All right. Now get out of here.<br />- Okay.
375775 377504 Thank you, sir.
379912 382176 Yo, Robert. Yo.
382348 384111 - Hey, Rocky.<br />- Hey.
384450 385644 - Hey, how you doing?<br />- Hey.
385818 387308 What's up, champ?
387487 389182 - You caught me off guard.<br />- I know.
389355 391289 I wanted to catch you<br />before you got busy.
391457 393118 Yeah, it gets busy up there.
393292 395886 - So how you doing? Yeah?<br />- Real good. Yeah.
396295 399287 - Yo, Rock!<br />- Yeah, how you doing?
399465 401092 Yeah, real good.
401267 403861 Listen, you wanna go out<br />and get some coffee?
404036 405731 I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?
406239 409299 Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to<br />come by the restaurant tonight.
409475 411909 I can have something<br />made special for you.
412078 415980 Tonight I can't. I got plans.<br />A few of the guys get together.
416549 419211 - Did I do something wrong?<br />- What do you mean?
419385 422081 Well, I don't know exactly<br />what I mean...
422255 426191 ...but I just think, like, when I come<br />here, you don't feel so comfortable.
426392 428656 And I certainly don't wanna do that.
430029 433055 - Well, you throw a big shadow.<br />- A big shadow?
433232 435860 You're not gonna get anything done<br />down here, Robert.
436035 439402 Well, if you're not gonna introduce me,<br />I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.
439572 441767 - How you doing?<br />- Your son works for me.
442308 444003 - It's a good job.<br />- Yeah.
444176 447009 I've told Robert about 20 times<br />that I wanted to meet you.
447179 449340 You're pretty busy,<br />which isn't a bad thing.
449549 451915 - I get a little tied up.<br />- Grab a shot, will you?
452518 455749 I may not get this chance again.<br />Old warhorses have to stick together.
455922 458254 - The old horses, yeah.<br />- I'll tell you.
459125 462185 - Good thing it's not your left.<br />- This makes you popular with people.
462595 465530 - One, two, three.<br />- Finally, we get to meet.
465698 468428 I gotta get going. It was nice<br />to meet you face to face.
468601 471968 You take care of yourself.<br />Robert, I'll see you later.
474373 477934 I gotta get going.<br />I'll change my plans for tonight.
478110 479975 That'd be great.<br />I'm looking forward to it.
480146 481579 - How you doing?<br />- Okay.
481747 483544 - Okay.<br />- All right.
483716 487117 And do not let those numbers<br />drive you crazy.
487286 491347 - Too late.<br />- Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.
493459 494687 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Hey, guys.
495061 497120 - Hey, Rock.<br />- Hey, how you doing?
512578 513567 There you go.
519251 522709 It'll be about 10 tenths.<br />You guys take care, okay? You got it.
526025 528050 I'll try a few of these later on.
528894 531419 - It's good for baking.<br />- How much...?
531597 533565 - Yo, Paul, what's the cost?<br />- 58.40, sir.
533733 536133 All right, take it out of that.<br />I trust you.
538437 540132 - How you doing?<br />- You're too generous.
540306 542035 Not a problem.
558157 560591 How you guys doing?
566932 569025 How we doing, Isabel?
569201 571601 Okay, except for the freebie<br />reading the Bible.
571771 574205 - He's okay.<br />- Just because you fought him...
574373 577274 ...don't mean you gotta feed him.<br />He doesn't look like a fighter.
577443 579104 Spider Rico could hit.
579278 581838 - Listen, how's your stomach?<br />- It's okay.
582048 584346 If you keep rubbing olive oil<br />on your stomach...
584517 586508 ...your kid's gonna be<br />born very strong.
586686 589553 - Okay, Rocky. Whatever you say.<br />- No, really.
592425 595019 - Yo, how you doing, Spider?<br />- God bless you, Rocky.
595227 596455 Thanks.
601767 603758 How you guys doing?
605604 609438 Jose, can you make something special<br />for my kid who's coming tonight?
609642 610904 No problemo.
611077 614171 Good. I appreciate it.
615915 618850 Back and forth, back and forth,<br />give and take.
619018 622283 And then I went in there like an animal<br />and threw him into the corner...
622455 626152 ...and I unloaded everything I had.<br />Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
626325 628953 But Creed, he kept<br />busting me back pretty good...
629128 631062 ...and the agony began to pile up.
631230 634529 Then I heard the best sound<br />that I ever heard in my life...
634700 636327 - The bell.<br />- That's right, the bell.
636502 639665 I ain't never been so tired,<br />and I'm sitting in my corner.
639839 642467 I'm trying to figure out<br />how to survive the last round...
642641 644472 ...when Mickey leans<br />into my ear and says:
644643 647737 "Come on, get out there<br />and fight this guy hard, you bum.
647913 652748 You gotta be first. You gotta be first."<br />I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could...
652918 655682 - "I would."<br />...I would."
655855 657152 The end.
683883 687080 Yet another quick knockout for<br />Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.
687253 689915 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
690089 691681 They're actually pelting...
691857 696453 ...the undefeated heavyweight<br />champion of the world with ice.
701500 704799 Hello, Adriars. Yeah?
705337 709671 Tell him you can't make it?<br />Yeah, I'll give him the message.
711076 715206 I just kept hearing Mickey's voice<br />in my head over and over again.
715414 717314 I just dug down,<br />and before you know it...
717483 720680 ...it was toe to toe and it was...<br />Excuse me.
720853 725085 Your son said he can't make it.<br />He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?
738504 739698 Look at these birds.
739872 742670 Don't these birds look like candy?<br />Flying candy?
742842 744742 Hey, birdie,<br />you wanna fly me home?
744910 747435 You need somebody<br />to walk you home?
748380 749369 No?
749548 754451 It's a cold night. We need a few laughs<br />in our life. What do you think? Maybe?
755120 757111 Maybe? Maybe?
757289 759780 Okay. Let' get out of here, okay?
774773 777207 That place ain't changed much<br />from last year.
777376 779139 Are we done?
779445 781640 Hey, how you doing, Mick?
784516 786484 That sign is falling apart, Paulie.
786652 789985 The whole world is falling apart.<br />Look at us.
790155 792521 Don't talk crazy, Paulie.
792758 798025 You know, I think if you live someplace<br />long enough, you are that place.
798631 801191 I ain't no talking building.
801367 803631 Come on, it's getting late, Rocko.
803936 806666 I get a headache from this train.
826592 829459 I remember when<br />she was standing there...
829628 833325 ...all nervous and shy,<br />with this little smile.
833966 837163 And all I wanted her to do<br />was trust me.
840506 842474 She did.
843542 845976 - She did.<br />- You done?
861527 864325 - How long are we staying here?<br />- Not long.
864496 866862 Well, I'm glad they tore<br />this ice rink down.
867032 868260 Come on.
868434 872234 You heard me.<br />I'm happy they tore it apart.
875874 880334 First time I walked your sister<br />across this ice, we was over there.
880512 884004 She was nervous, but I wasrt so great<br />on the blades either.
884183 888210 Ice is stupid. People standing on ice<br />are more stupid.
889455 893414 And over there,<br />when she was falling...
893759 895226 ...and my hand grabbed her...
896362 900230 ...and I got her arm through that coat,<br />I could feel it.
901033 902796 Electric.
903302 905736 You said the same thing<br />last year, Rock.
907039 908301 Did I?
908474 910669 - So you better develop your brain.
910843 912708 - You're left-handed.<br />- Absolutely.
912878 915176 Come on, Rock. Let's go.
917616 921416 We're done. There's no place<br />to sit down around here.
921587 922884 It's all right.
923055 927389 It ain't all right! It's depressing<br />and freaking cold!
928127 929754 What's the matter with you, Paulie?
930129 932222 You're living backwards, Rocko!
932398 935890 Change the channel from yesterday!<br />Yesterday wasrt so great!
936068 938468 - It was to me.<br />- Not to me!
940339 943502 You treated her good.<br />You had the good times.
944410 947937 I treated her bad.<br />I don't have to think about this.
949348 951509 She always loved you, Paulie.
955821 959086 Sorry, Rocko,<br />I can't do this no more.
1031930 1033090 Can I help you?
1033499 1036161 No, no, I used to come down<br />to this place a long time ago.
1036335 1038963 I was just looking around.<br />No big deal.
1039838 1041066 Can I get you a drink?
1043008 1046341 - All right. Maybe just a short beer.<br />- Okay.
1055254 1057051 Go. Go on.
1058023 1059854 Yeah, go on.<br />Get him to buy a round.
1060025 1061925 Get him to buy a round. Go.
1062294 1065161 Get him to... He's got it.<br />He's spending money.
1065330 1070529 Listen, I don't mean to cross the line<br />or anything...
1070702 1073694 ...but I read about your wife's passing<br />a few years back.
1073872 1075430 Yeah, it was woman cancer.
1075607 1078576 Yeah. I always heard<br />she was a nice person.
1078744 1081178 Yeah, the best.
1082214 1084580 - Do I know you?<br />- We met a long time ago.
1085083 1086141 We did?
1086351 1088842 When I was a kid,<br />you walked me home.
1089021 1092286 - I did?<br />- Told me to stop smoking and things.
1093825 1096020 Stop smoking...
1096695 1100222 Are you Little Marie that used to<br />hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
1100399 1102230 Yeah, that's right.
1102868 1105234 Yeah, now I remember.<br />I walked you home.
1105404 1109272 When you got there, you turned<br />around and said, "Screw you, creepo."
1109441 1111773 - I didn't say that.<br />- Yeah, you did.
1111944 1115380 - You sure?<br />- Great insults last a long time.
1115547 1118914 Yo! Yo, is that you?<br />Is that really you?
1119451 1121783 - How you doing?<br />- I think he wants to drink alone.
1122020 1124989 Well, then give him his drink, then.<br />I ain't stopping you.
1125190 1128626 What's that, your man or something?<br />No, I don't think so.
1131463 1134796 Anyway, me and my friends,<br />we're right down there.
1134967 1138266 Think you could buy us a round?<br />You got the money. Just one round.
1138437 1141338 Hey. Thank you.
1141506 1144600 What are you doing<br />pushing my hand away like that?
1144776 1147176 - What's your name?<br />- Angie. What do you wanna know for?
1147346 1150315 - Don't be playing a fool for that guy.<br />- A fool?
1150482 1151676 - Yeah.<br />- A fool?
1151850 1154819 I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!
1154987 1158013 You got it twisted. You're the fool.<br />I'm a person, just like you.
1158223 1161784 You ain't no better than me. You think<br />you're a big shot now? You're nothing.
1161960 1165794 You ain't no better than me.<br />No better!
1167432 1168729 Glad you dropped in?
1168900 1171562 I think the neighborhood<br />is changing a little.
1172437 1175167 - What was that all about?<br />- I don't know. Forget about it.
1175340 1178571 I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna<br />take off, I'll tally everything up.
1178744 1180371 - Yeah, thanks.<br />- How you doing, Rock?
1180545 1182137 I'm good, thanks.
1184683 1187516 - You live around here?<br />- About eight blocks from here.
1188687 1190518 Eight blocks.
1191690 1193453 You need a lift?
1193925 1195950 All right.
1196128 1197925 Did you ever get married?
1198096 1199893 - Yeah, sort of.<br />- Sort of?
1200065 1202556 - Yeah, well, he took off.<br />- Poof, just like that?
1202734 1204861 Yeah, just like that.
1205304 1208171 - You sort of have any kids?<br />- Yeah, I got one kid.
1208373 1212002 Yeah? Me too. Me too.<br />Wonderful boy.
1212177 1215840 Hey, tough guy! What's the matter,<br />you can't buy a round?
1216014 1218574 The girl was being nice<br />to your dumb ass.
1218750 1221412 - What you doing with that pig?<br />- Think you can disrespect us?
1221586 1224487 - She ain't nothing but a jealous bitch!<br />- Come on back!
1224856 1226619 Hey, don't listen to them.
1226792 1229818 Both of youse,<br />you ain't no better than me.
1229995 1233260 Come over here, you'll get<br />your head kicked in around here.
1233432 1237493 - You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.<br />- You ain't no big shot, look at you.
1237669 1241571 You ain't even got a car<br />to take that pig home.
1244309 1245606 You all right?
1247145 1248134 Yeah.
1250782 1253580 What are you doing?<br />Don't get out. It's all right.
1256388 1259585 No, Little Marie. It ain't all right.
1264363 1266126 - Yo.<br />- What?
1266331 1268299 I'll tell you what. Get inside.
1268467 1271493 - You get inside. Yeah, you.<br />- Hey, leave him alone!
1271670 1272898 - Yo, man!<br />- See it?
1273071 1275266 - You see that? You see that?<br />- Yeah. All right.
1275440 1277772 - What do you say?<br />- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
1277943 1279604 Get a job!
1295660 1297628 That guy sends his apologies.
1298497 1299964 Okay.
1316782 1321151 Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!
1325991 1327891 I see you still got your key.
1328059 1329959 Yeah, I got a key.<br />You got time to talk?
1330662 1333358 I got a lot of time<br />since your people let me go.
1333532 1335830 You know I had<br />nothing to do with that.
1336001 1337525 Yeah.
1339204 1341229 Yeah, we moved in<br />about a year ago.
1341406 1343738 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.
1343909 1346810 - Yeah, I could see that.<br />- I'm gonna look for an apartment.
1346978 1348570 Apartments are nice.
1348747 1350476 Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
1350649 1352549 Yeah, it is what it is.
1352717 1355914 This place used to be pretty nice.<br />There's a lot of history around here.
1356087 1357611 - Yeah.<br />- Like down the street...
1357789 1359381 ...is the Cambria fight Club.
1359558 1361423 They used to call it<br />the Bucket of Blood.
1361593 1364858 I took some massive beatings there.<br />But it was nice. Good memories.
1365030 1370093 And I heard these buildings are like,<br />I don't know, 100, 150 years old.
1370268 1375331 If I was 150 years old, I'd be falling<br />apart too. So it's okay, building.
1375507 1376735 Does that light work?
1376908 1379240 - No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.<br />- Yeah?
1381847 1386250 Listen, thanks for the ride,<br />and I'm sorry about those guys.
1386418 1389979 Some of those guys just got their<br />brains on backwards and stuff.
1390155 1393022 - What's he doing out so late?<br />- Is that your kid?
1393191 1395318 Yeah. Wish he wouldn't<br />stay out so late.
1395627 1398425 - Amazing.<br />- Yeah, what's that?
1399030 1401362 Last time I seen you,<br />you was a kid...
1401533 1403694 ...and now you officially<br />got one of your own.
1403869 1404961 It's amazing.
1405136 1409197 You know, he sort of resembles you.<br />He's got that big Irish hair.
1410108 1411370 Yeah, it's the other one.
1414846 1417246 - Yeah?<br />- His father was from Jamaica.
1417415 1418746 Jamaica? European.
1421786 1424186 Was you on a cruise ship<br />or something?
1424356 1426290 - No, not really.<br />- What's his name?
1426458 1431054 - Steps. Short for Stevenson.<br />- Makes sense.
1434599 1437762 Does he look mad at me, or is it<br />maybe the angle I'm standing at?
1437936 1440564 No. He's a good kid.
1440739 1443173 - You wanna meet him?<br />- It's getting kind of late.
1443341 1446936 - I got so many things to do.<br />- Yeah, yeah, I understand.
1447812 1451748 Thanks again for the ride<br />and everything else.
1453785 1455343 I'll see you.
1456488 1457921 You too.
1458089 1462025 Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go.<br />Say good night to your friend.
1462260 1464694 What are you doing out<br />in the cold with no hat on?
1464863 1467229 - Did you get something to eat?<br />- Yeah, I already ate.
1467399 1468991 All right.
1469167 1471499 - You're late, you know.<br />- I can take care of myself.
1472337 1474271 Yo, Little Marie!
1475440 1477408 Ain't you gonna<br />introduce me to your kid?
1477576 1479806 - How you doing, Steps?<br />- What's up?
1479978 1485177 Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,<br />nice little eatery not too far from here.
1485350 1487318 What's all this junk? Got a tissue.
1487485 1491148 Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo,<br />all the stuff in my pocket, you know.
1491323 1493450 Here you go.<br />I got a card, there it is.
1493625 1495684 And if you ever get a chance,<br />it'd be great...
1495860 1498693 ...if both of youse<br />come down there and eat.
1498863 1504699 It'd be great, free. You know.<br />Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.
1505904 1509431 I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.
1512978 1514741 See you later.
1516781 1518646 Come on, let's go.
1521186 1523484 You've known what' best for you<br />since you were 10.
1523655 1525680 Since you walked in here alone.
1526658 1529126 Got everything money can buy...
1529294 1531353 ...except what it can't.
1532163 1536156 It's pride. Pride is what got<br />your ass out of here.
1537669 1539534 Losing is what brung you back.
1541106 1545873 But people like you, they need<br />to be tested. Need a challenge.
1546044 1548274 That ain't gonna happen.<br />Ain't nothing out there.
1548613 1552014 There's always somebody<br />out there. Always.
1552484 1554748 When that time comes<br />and you find something...
1554919 1557387 ...standing in front of you<br />that ain't running...
1557555 1562925 ...that ain't backing up, hitting on you,<br />and you're too damn tired to breathe...
1563294 1566263 You find that situation on you,<br />that's good.
1566431 1568956 Because that's baptism under fire.
1571036 1573732 You get through that,<br />you find the only kind of respect...
1573905 1575566 ...that matters in this damn world:
1575740 1577901 Self-respect.
1580445 1583312 Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.
1583481 1585244 Now, what can the champ<br />do for you?
1586584 1589246 You can give me<br />some of that money you got.
1590488 1593048 - You know, I like you, Martin.<br />- But not that much.
1594159 1596150 Exactly.
1599931 1602161 How about a picture with the kid?<br />All right?
1602333 1603732 Sure.
1605670 1608468 Here, son, hold up your fist.<br />Makes you look more hazardous.
1611142 1612404 - There you go.<br />- Thanks, Rock.
1612577 1614442 Enjoy your meal.
1615280 1616872 - He's a nice guy, isn't he?<br />- Rocky?
1617048 1619175 - Yeah.<br />- Spider just went downstairs.
1619350 1621818 - I don't know if that's all right.<br />- What's he doing?
1621986 1624250 I don't know. That's your friend.
1630361 1631794 Yo, Spider!
1631963 1635524 - Let me do some dishes. I feel better.<br />- Come on. You're my guest.
1635700 1638191 - Let me do something.<br />- Keep eating. Guests do that.
1638369 1640803 Don't make me fight you again.<br />Last time you got lucky.
1641239 1643298 Lucky? Okay.
1643508 1645100 Jesus wants me to work.
1645810 1648278 - Yo, Rocky.<br />- Yeah?
1648446 1649538 You've got guests.
1652183 1653912 Don't get too wet, okay?
1655320 1657117 Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
1663528 1665189 You kept the card.
1665363 1667194 Yeah, I kept the card.
1667365 1669697 - Why don't you sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
1679277 1683839 Because, you know what, I walk in<br />there, I say good morning, I do this:
1684449 1685711 Tonight, boxing once again.
1685884 1688648 Two contrasting styles<br />in almost every way.
1688820 1692153 Hey, can you turn this up?<br />Turn this up, please.
1692323 1695690 Who was the best of all time?<br />If two athletes from different eras...
1695894 1699057 ...could compete against one another,<br />who would come out on top?
1699230 1703030 Given the same rules, using the same<br />equipment, who was the greatest?
1703201 1705032 We feed our facts<br />into the computer.
1705203 1707603 They weigh in on who they<br />think will reign supreme...
1707772 1710900 ...while fielding the comments of our<br />illustrious panel of sportswriters.
1716681 1718308 Champ!
1719884 1721351 - Yo, champ!<br />- Yeah?
1721519 1724454 Come check out this trash<br />they're talking about you, man!
1724622 1727557 - What you talking about?<br />- Come check this out. Hurry up.
1727859 1730225 Tonight, the former two-time<br />heavyweight champion...
1730395 1732420 ...from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.
1732597 1734565 All right, Chuck Johnson,<br />USA Today?
1734732 1737496 There' no question that<br />Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights...
1737669 1739227 ...during a tougher era in boxing.
1739404 1741235 You look at Mason Dixon<br />in his career...
1741406 1743704 ...he' basically been<br />spoon-fed his opponents.
1743875 1746070 No question in my mind.<br />Not only does Rocky win...
1746244 1747541 ...but he wins knockout.
1749647 1751274 Rocky!
1752650 1753639 Offspring.
1754953 1755977 Bernard Fernandez?
1756154 1757917 Dixon is a victim<br />of his own dominance.
1758089 1761149 He' never been in<br />real knockdown-dragout brawls.
1761326 1763089 He never had to dig down<br />to rally back.
1763561 1765461 If he tries to dig down<br />against Balboa...
1765630 1768064 ...he'll find he doesn't have<br />a big enough shovel.
1768233 1771066 I clearly give it to Balboa.
1771269 1774500 What happened to you?<br />What happened to you?
1774672 1777072 Boxing historian<br />Burt Randolph Sugar.
1777242 1780439 Dixon has fought cream puffs.<br />We don't know what he' made of.
1780612 1782739 But both in their primes,<br />you gotta factor in...
1782914 1784814 ...Dixor unbelievable speed...
1784983 1787611 ...his slashing offense.<br />He cuts Balboa to bits.
1787785 1790618 No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.
1791923 1796360 Here' where our subjectivity ends.<br />Let' see what the computer says.
1796527 1801294 Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has<br />no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.
1802333 1804096 - What time is it?<br />- Mason time.
1804302 1806930 - What time is it?<br />- Mason time.
1807105 1809266 - What time is it?<br />- Mason time.
1817649 1822109 Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.<br />He is almost out on his feet!
1822287 1824812 Balboa turning up the heat.<br />Pounds him across the ring.
1824989 1828720 Boy, he' bit off more than he<br />can chew this time. Believe it.
1828893 1832226 Oh, a murderous right hook!<br />And Dixon is out on his feet.
1832630 1835793 He is out cold as he<br />crumbles to the canvas.
1835967 1840199 And it is Balboa who has won...
1841306 1844104 Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky.<br />Baby Rocky.
1850615 1855052 I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat<br />that up, it's pretty good in the morning.
1856321 1857788 Yeah, thanks, man.
1858323 1862020 Nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving<br />you a headache. I like this old stuff.
1862193 1864354 No, I like it. It's nice.
1864796 1866821 Well, good. Good.
1876240 1880472 Yo, you think Steps wants a job?<br />Make a few bucks on the weekend?
1880645 1884274 It's good making your own G's. My kid<br />stashed a few bucks doing that.
1884849 1886578 Why are you being so nice?
1887819 1890014 I don't want you to think<br />nothing's off, you know.
1890188 1893351 My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.<br />You know what I mean?
1893524 1895617 Yeah, well, I wasrt thinking that.<br />Believe me.
1895793 1898421 - No? Then what was you thinking?<br />- No.
1898596 1901030 That you don't owe us nothing.<br />What are you doing?
1901199 1902928 Be patient.
1903101 1904591 Now...
1905136 1909072 ...I don't owe you nothing,<br />but why do you gotta...
1909240 1912869 ...owe something to get...?
1913845 1915073 Bingo.
1920385 1924719 Why do you gotta owe something<br />to get something, you know? Really.
1927592 1931323 I think hanging out with your kid<br />would be nice. What do you think?
1931496 1933691 I think that'd be nice.
1934766 1938202 Good. That's very nice.
1938369 1940564 I'm glad you come by.
1941039 1944338 It was nice watching you eat.
1946244 1948041 Good company.
1951082 1953642 Yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!
1964695 1966754 - You like dogs?<br />- Dogs?
1966931 1971595 Dogs. This is like a dog pound.<br />It's where they keep...
1972070 1976769 ...a large variety of dogs. I used to<br />come here all the time for sightseeing.
1976941 1980377 But, you know,<br />you learn a lot talking to dogs.
1980545 1984003 - Really, you do.<br />- Yeah, man. So...
1984182 1986673 Hey, man, how about this one?
1988319 1990048 He don't look too friendly, my friend.
1990221 1992917 Man, this is the one.<br />Hey, boy, how you doing?
1993091 1996356 Hey, what about this one here?<br />Come here, boy.
1996527 1998017 - Who, him?<br />- Yeah, why not?
1998196 2000357 Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
2000531 2004865 I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.<br />If you look at it closely, the color...
2005036 2008870 ...it looks like old furniture, like some<br />kind of pirate-chest thing going on.
2009040 2011474 Yeah, sure, man.<br />Hey, so how about a young one?
2011642 2015134 Steps, forget him. Come over here.<br />I want you to see something.
2015313 2019682 Now, you notice what this animal<br />is doing here? Lying in that position?
2019851 2021079 He ain't doing nothing.
2021252 2023982 No, he's doing a lot.<br />He ain't wasting no energy.
2024155 2025315 Because he's dead.
2031596 2034497 He ain't dead. There's a lot of<br />good mileage left on that animal.
2034665 2038726 Good food, the addition of a couple<br />of new friends, bingo, he's back.
2038903 2042339 - What do you think is a good name?<br />- It's your dog. You name him.
2042507 2045101 No. It's, like,<br />a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
2045276 2047744 Look, I don't know much<br />about no dogs.
2047912 2049539 Well, it ain't that complicated.
2049714 2053309 You pet him, you feed him,<br />and nature takes its course.
2053518 2056351 You know, so...<br />Don't you wanna name an animal?
2056521 2060548 Every guy should at one time<br />try to name an animal something.
2061058 2062491 I don't know. Fleabag?
2063294 2067355 It's catchy. It ain't original,<br />but it's pretty good.
2067532 2069932 I think you could come up with,<br />in your young brain...
2070101 2073093 ...something better to throw out<br />than fleabag.
2073938 2075769 Punchy. How's that?
2077275 2079675 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah, Punchy.
2083447 2085472 - I like it, you know.<br />- For real?
2085650 2090883 Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to<br />remember, it's not that hard to spell.
2091055 2094456 And once it's in your brain, you never<br />forget it. Punchy. Very good.
2094625 2097287 - All right, man.<br />- Good call.
2097461 2100624 All right, Punchy. You ready<br />to get bailed out, my friend?
2100898 2102763 Okay.
2103868 2105733 Hey, you know<br />it was a joke, don't you?
2105903 2108667 Yeah, I know.<br />You're a very funny guy.
2143474 2145101 Rocky?
2146077 2148204 The fans let him know<br />how they feel about it.
2148379 2150643 - Excuse me.<br />- Sure.
2152250 2154650 This could get ugly.
2155386 2156876 - Rock.<br />- Yo, Paulie.
2157054 2159989 They're gonna be talking about<br />that fake Looney Tune fight.
2160691 2163421 Hey, come on. We're about<br />to serve today's special.
2163594 2167052 Italian food cooked up by a bunch<br />of Mexicans ain't so special.
2167231 2169165 Hey, yo.
2170501 2172093 Hey, I skipped work for this.
2176007 2178601 What an ugly dog.
2179844 2181209 It's a cute dog.
2183481 2184709 - Hey, Rock.<br />- Yeah?
2184882 2187783 I'm gonna take off.<br />That stuff back there is pretty cool.
2187985 2189350 - Oh, you like that?<br />- Yeah, man.
2189887 2192117 - Thanks, I appreciate it.<br />- I'll catch you later.
2192290 2194087 All right.
2198696 2200891 - Who's the criminal?<br />- He's a nice kid.
2201065 2202726 He dresses like a bum.
2203167 2205727 Coming from a human hamper,<br />that's quite a compliment.
2207204 2208694 Hide the silverware.
2208873 2210431 That's nice.
2212376 2213502 Hey, Spider.
2218316 2220580 Didrt you knock out<br />that bum once?
2220751 2222719 Will you give it a rest?
2233130 2236429 I'm gonna be late for work for this.<br />Give me a break, huh?
2236667 2239431 All right. Just for a few seconds.
2239603 2242800 In the late '60s, a simulated fight<br />took place between two legends...
2243007 2245407 ...Muhammad Ali<br />and Rocky Marciano.
2245576 2249342 Marciano long retired,<br />and Ali unable to fight legitimately...
2249513 2252880 ...for three years for having refused<br />induction into the armed forces...
2253050 2255848 ...was in need of money,<br />and agreed to the dream match...
2256020 2258580 ...whose outcome would be<br />decided by a computer.
2258756 2260986 It' almost 35 years<br />since Rocky Marciano...
2261158 2263524 ...won the much-disputed<br />computer decision...
2263694 2266390 ...and guess what?<br />Not much has changed.
2266564 2268759 Last week, Rocky Balboa<br />won a decisive fight...
2268933 2271959 See? That's the can'toon fight<br />I'm telling you about.
2272136 2273603 Yeah.
2273771 2275238 A stunning knockout.
2275406 2278034 Keep in mind, this is taking<br />the human factor out of it.
2278242 2280039 - The computer says Balboa...<br />- Beautiful.
2280211 2285012 ...would be triumphant, KO 13.<br />And here' some of the fallout:
2285182 2287377 What started as a simple<br />form of entertainment...
2287551 2289849 ...has become a rallying cry<br />for people who think...
2290020 2292784 ...an old-school athlete like Balboa<br />could actually be better.
2292957 2296688 Computer technology has to create<br />what isn't. That' just not responsible.
2296861 2298829 Get therapy, will you?
2298996 2301521 How do you think Balboa<br />would have done against Dixon?
2301699 2304862 Badly. Personally, I think Balboa<br />was completely overrated.
2305035 2306866 He owns a restaurant<br />in South Philly.
2307037 2309005 What' the specialty,<br />pounded chicken?
2309173 2312631 Anyway, I would have paid to see<br />the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...
2312810 2314710 ...and the controversy<br />that won't go away.
2314879 2317279 Let' go back to Sunday' race...
2317448 2319109 Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.
2319283 2322810 It's free advertisement.<br />Come on. Meat house calls.
2332830 2334627 Yo, Robert.
2337168 2338760 What are you doing out so late?
2338936 2341496 I tried calling,<br />but nothing was picking up.
2341672 2343902 - Is something wrong?<br />- I just wanted to come by...
2344074 2346065 ...and see you in person.<br />- Wanna come inside?
2346243 2349041 No. I just wanna get<br />your opinion on something.
2349680 2351147 Sure. Opinion on what?
2351315 2353681 You know, they say you only<br />go around once, right?
2353851 2356081 - Yeah, I've heard that.<br />- Well...
2356253 2358744 ...I think I wanna, like,<br />do something.
2358923 2361824 - Like what?<br />- Fight.
2362626 2366221 You know, nothing big.<br />Small stuff, like locally. You know.
2368132 2370965 Don't you think you're too,<br />you know, old?
2371502 2373436 You think you ought to<br />stop trying things...
2373604 2376072 ...because you had a few<br />too many birthdays? I do not.
2376240 2377673 People will think you're crazy.
2377842 2381744 What's crazy about standing<br />toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?
2382012 2383536 That's just ego talking.
2385082 2387744 What are you trying to prove<br />to other people, Pop?
2388752 2391243 Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...
2391422 2393515 ...the way other people think<br />a long time ago.
2393691 2395386 You gotta think like you think.
2397228 2400959 - I do.<br />- Do you? Good.
2401131 2405693 You gotta face reality, okay?<br />It's a different world now.
2406570 2408936 Only the clothes is different.
2410941 2413933 I really don't know<br />what you want from me.
2414311 2419271 I just wanted us to get involved.<br />You know, like, home team.
2421318 2426779 Look, whatever it is, whatever<br />you're going through, it'll pass.
2426991 2428982 Yeah, you're probably right.
2429159 2431719 Time is gonna catch up to all of us.
2431962 2435227 - Especially if you're standing still.<br />- Hey, come on.
2438102 2440400 Look, I'm gonna call you<br />in the morning.
2443340 2445808 - Did you tell this to your kid?<br />- Yeah, I did.
2445976 2448137 - What'd he think, you're nuts, right?<br />- Yeah.
2448312 2454046 Oh, well, he don't believe in you?<br />Welcome to my world, buddy.
2454218 2457449 Rocko, nobody's giving you<br />no title shot.
2457621 2460021 I know that. I don't want one.
2460190 2462590 So this isn't a mental disturbance?
2463761 2465126 No.
2465329 2468321 You're mad because<br />they took down your statue?
2468933 2470764 No.
2471602 2473160 Not really, no.
2473370 2478467 If it's about money, just hang a sign<br />around your neck saying, "Punch me."
2478642 2481611 Five dollars, you'll make big money.
2483314 2485748 What? You haven't peaked yet?
2486650 2489050 - Peaked?<br />- Yeah, peaked.
2489486 2491977 I don't know. There's still<br />some stuff in the basement.
2493057 2495787 - What basement?<br />- In here.
2496627 2498288 Tell me about the stuff.
2499597 2503033 - What about it?<br />- Tell me about the stuff inside.
2503200 2505634 - Is it angry?<br />- Angry?
2505803 2507896 Are you mad because<br />Adrian left you?
2508072 2510666 She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
2510841 2512638 Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
2517147 2520878 You know, sometimes<br />it's hard to breathe.
2521051 2524782 You know, I feel, like,<br />this beast inside me.
2525089 2527751 It's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.
2527925 2531326 Is it okay?
2536667 2540262 I just never knew it was<br />supposed to be this hard.
2540437 2543406 It wasrt supposed to be like this,<br />Paulie. You know, it...
2553384 2555545 So you wanna come by<br />and help me train?
2555719 2557152 I got a job here.
2557588 2559146 I understand.
2559590 2562457 Remember you said if you stay<br />one place long enough...
2562626 2563957 ...you become that place?
2564628 2566892 Rocko, this is all I got.
2567331 2569856 I understand, Paulie. I do.
2574438 2578431 If you get time and come down<br />and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
2579410 2581401 Of course, Rocko.
2584548 2586243 Bye, Paulie.
2586483 2586917 Goodbye, Rocko.
2586917 2588544 Goodbye, Rocko.
2591221 2593246 Take care, Rocko.
2598562 2602191 This plenary session of the<br />Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...
2602366 2607929 ...is convened in order to consider<br />the application of Rocky Balboa...
2608105 2612337 ...for the issuance of a discretionary<br />professional boxing license...
2612509 2617310 ...due to his ineligibility to be<br />licensed as a matter of right.
2617481 2621440 Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.<br />Since you're representing yourself...
2621618 2624746 ...we invite you to make an opening<br />statement, if you'd like to.
2624922 2627482 No, I was just curious how I did,<br />that's all.
2627658 2632186 All right, well, the Medical<br />Advisory Board has informed us...
2632362 2635297 ...that the battery of tests<br />to which you've been subjected...
2635466 2638731 ...you've passed these tests<br />with flying colors.
2638969 2641494 And we congratulate you for that.
2641672 2644573 - Thanks.<br />- However, this commission...
2644742 2648508 ...in good conscience,<br />cannot recommend you for a license...
2648912 2652109 ...and we therefore deny<br />your application.
2653450 2656248 - Didrt I do what you asked?<br />- Yes, you did.
2656420 2658115 So I should get a license, right?
2658455 2659649 Not exactly.
2662659 2666186 So why did you give me all them tests<br />if you was never passing me?
2666363 2668331 We've gotta stand by<br />our decision here...
2668499 2671866 ...and we have to deny your request<br />for a license at this time.
2684148 2686742 Yo, don't I got some rights?
2686917 2689010 What rights do you think<br />you're referring to?
2689186 2691848 Like in that official paper<br />they wrote down the street?
2692022 2693956 - That's the Bill of Rights.<br />- Bill of Rights.
2694124 2696354 Don't it say something about going<br />after what makes you happy?
2696527 2699291 No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."<br />But what's your point?
2699463 2702728 My point is I'm pursuing something,<br />and nobody looks too happy about it.
2703033 2705399 But we're just looking out<br />for your interests.
2705569 2709232 I appreciate that, but maybe you're<br />looking out for your interests more.
2709406 2712739 You shouldn't ask people to come here<br />and pay the freight on something.
2712910 2716073 They pay, it still ain't good enough.<br />You think that's right?
2716246 2719511 Maybe you're doing your job, but why<br />you gotta stop me from doing mine?
2720050 2723918 If you're willing to go through all the<br />battling to get where you want to get...
2724087 2725816 ...who's got the right to stop you?
2725989 2729425 Maybe you got something you never<br />finished, something you wanna do.
2729593 2731823 Something you never said<br />to somebody, something!
2731995 2734122 And you're told no,<br />even after you pay your dues.
2734298 2736892 Who's got the right<br />to tell you that? Who? Nobody!
2737067 2740230 It's your right to listen to your gut.<br />It's nobody's right to say no...
2740404 2743805 ...after you earn the right to be what you<br />wanna be or do what you wanna do!
2748045 2752141 The older I get, the more things<br />I gotta leave behind. That's life.
2752316 2756878 The only thing I'm asking you guys<br />to leave on the table is what's right.
2774304 2776101 Yo! Have you seen<br />the paper today?
2776273 2778400 Front row. Front row.
2779743 2780801 That is so great.
2781011 2783502 - All right, all right.<br />- Let's go get some food. Food.
2783680 2787514 - Let's get a beer. Come on.<br />- Come on.
2787985 2790044 The last two pay-per-views<br />were in the toilet.
2790220 2792814 You're not making<br />heavyweight-championship money.
2792990 2794958 There's a bunch of nobodies<br />out there, Mase.
2795125 2798151 I wanna talk to you about an<br />opportunity we should run with.
2798328 2802162 Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa<br />applied for a license and got one?
2802332 2804232 - I heard. Forget about him.<br />- Hear me out.
2804401 2807768 You want me to fight a guy I can beat<br />with both hands tied behind my back.
2807938 2811305 Everybody knows you could beat him<br />sitting down. That's not what it's about.
2811475 2814740 It's about making money. We gotta<br />capitalize on that computer fight.
2814912 2817642 This could do a million buys.<br />That's 15, 20 million to you.
2817814 2819805 - Forget it.<br />- No one's beating the door down...
2819983 2822645 ...to watch you fight anymore.<br />- We got guaranteed fights.
2822819 2825788 You wanna do this now in front<br />of your friends, we'll do it now.
2825956 2829414 We got nothing. All the pay-per-view<br />fights you come up with got rejected.
2829593 2833120 You know why? They're all bums<br />out there. Nobody cares about them.
2833530 2837261 There's no marquee value.<br />But this Balboa thing is interesting.
2837567 2839125 - I don't wanna do it.<br />- Listen to me.
2839303 2843205 It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.<br />Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...
2843373 2846570 ...but people relate to that stuff.<br />This is a no-lose. It's all good.
2847044 2849638 - Good for who?<br />- For you! Not for me! For you!
2849980 2852915 Maybe you don't understand.<br />People don't like you no more.
2853083 2856541 They don't follow you. They're not<br />supporting you anymore. Understand?
2856720 2858847 Don't look at me like<br />I'm messing with your legacy.
2859022 2860751 Every jock now thinks<br />they got a legacy.
2860924 2863859 A legacy is what you get instead<br />of getting paid. That's a legacy.
2864027 2866587 - Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br />- I'm not no more.
2866763 2870324 Everybody knows you could kick<br />this old mars ass. But you don't.
2870500 2872525 Leave him with a little<br />dignity, so they say:
2872703 2876195 "Mason Dixors got compassion.<br />He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."
2876373 2878773 You get a whole new audience,<br />we'll double your money.
2878942 2881001 You want a new image?<br />That's how you get it.
2881178 2882907 To replace the one<br />that you two made?
2883080 2885913 Whoa, wait. We made your<br />world green. You made the rest.
2886083 2888051 This is you.<br />You made all this junk happen.
2888218 2889913 I've had it up to here with this mess.
2890087 2892578 Time for me to make changes.<br />I'm going to Martirs gym.
2892756 2894485 - We'll talk about it.<br />- Forget this crap.
2894658 2897024 I want Martin back.<br />There's nothing to talk about.
2907738 2909501 - How you doing?<br />- Hey, what a surprise.
2909673 2912073 I was driving around<br />the neighborhood, I thought...
2912242 2914870 ...why not drive by and say hello?<br />- You wanna come inside?
2915045 2918071 No, the dog needs some exercise.<br />You wanna take a little walk?
2918248 2920648 - Yeah, yeah. All right.<br />- It's nice outside.
2920817 2923377 - All right.<br />- Nice and brisk.
2923553 2924747 When did you get a dog?
2924921 2927014 We picked up Punchy<br />a couple of days back.
2927190 2928384 - Punchy?<br />- Yeah.
2928558 2929786 You named your dog Punchy?
2929960 2931655 Your kid come up with the name.
2931828 2934262 Oh, yeah?<br />I think that's disrespectful.
2934431 2936194 Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.
2936366 2939665 No, it's easy to remember<br />and it's all that, you know.
2939836 2942828 Listen, what do you think about<br />coming over to the restaurant?
2943006 2946032 - What for?<br />- Well, you know, for, like...
2946209 2949645 for work. The hostess is gonna<br />be having a kid. You'd do good.
2949813 2952338 - I don't know.<br />- I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
2952516 2954984 I appreciate what you're doing<br />for my kid, but I can't.
2955152 2957620 Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.
2957788 2960222 It's a nice environment,<br />it's very pleasant.
2960390 2962449 Yeah, can we drop it?
2964928 2966418 What's bothering you?
2966596 2968826 Nothing. It's all right.<br />Listen, I gotta get back.
2970267 2972201 - No, it ain't all right.<br />- Oh, come on.
2972536 2974401 - What?<br />- I'm gonna be the first person...
2974571 2977005 ...people see when they walk in?<br />- You give out menus.
2977174 2979938 You say, "Hello, how are you?"<br />You sit people down.
2980110 2982374 Look, if I can do it,<br />anybody can do it.
2982546 2985811 You could find 10 better people,<br />a hundred better people for this job.
2985982 2987813 Give it a try, like two weeks.
2987984 2989781 I don't wanna try.
2989953 2992183 - Who put this stuff in your head?<br />- Nobody.
2992355 2994346 Well, it just don't<br />get in there by itself.
2997928 2999862 Thanks for coming by.
3001765 3006259 Yo, when was the last time you<br />went dancing? Has it been a while?
3006436 3008301 - Why are you asking?<br />- I'm asking because...
3008472 3011737 ...you dance around these problems,<br />you might as well dance with me.
3011908 3014934 I ain't that good,<br />but I'm better than the average bear.
3015112 3017774 Where that came from, I don't know.
3018415 3019882 - You're crazy.<br />- A little bit.
3020050 3023315 But the way you're thinking<br />and talking, it's a little crazy too.
3024187 3027816 Come on, you deserve better.<br />Really. Come on over.
3027991 3032223 I need you to class my place up.<br />Philly needs you.
3032596 3036259 And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"<br />again, I totally understand.
3036433 3038867 But I'm warning you,<br />I'm gonna put myself...
3039035 3040900 ...in the middle of the street here...
3041071 3044006 ...and stand here, me and Punchy,<br />and wave to the first bus, say:
3044174 3045903 "Come on over here and mash me!
3046076 3048544 Little Marie turned down<br />the job at the restaurant.
3048712 3050407 She thinks she's better than us."
3050580 3053845 Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been<br />a bus down here in 20 years.
3054484 3056475 - Yeah?<br />- No.
3058555 3060182 That was a close call.
3061258 3066252 Listen, seriously. Come on over.<br />It'd be nice.
3068899 3070332 All right.
3088585 3090143 Paulie!
3093490 3095287 Sorry, Paulie.
3096693 3098388 Sorry.
3129659 3132787 How are you?<br />Get my unusual up there.
3132963 3135727 Excuse me.<br />Deliveries are in the back.
3135899 3137594 I'm not a delivery guy.
3137767 3139564 Well, do you have a reservation?
3139736 3142466 Do I look like a freaking Indian?
3145442 3147740 Hey, Rock? Rocky?
3152649 3155413 I think we've got a little bit<br />of a problem with this guy.
3155585 3157917 Problem?<br />No, no, he's just a relative.
3158088 3160352 Oh, okay.
3162892 3164325 Yo, Paulie.
3166596 3168587 - What happened to your eye?<br />- I hit it.
3168898 3170695 - Why?<br />- Needed to.
3171334 3172665 What happened?
3172836 3175566 - I'm celebrating, Rock.<br />- Why?
3175739 3178173 - I retired.<br />- Retired?
3184014 3186608 So when did they start<br />giving retired people meat...
3186783 3188944 ...instead of watches, Paulie?
3191755 3193723 I don't need a watch.
3195558 3198959 I got a watch! You gave me a watch!
3199162 3200424 Paulie...
3200597 3203122 I don't need no goddamn watch.
3204768 3207896 - Yo, Paulie.<br />- I got a watch!
3209205 3211196 I got two watches!
3211675 3213836 Yo, Paulie!
3226189 3227213 Yo, Paulie.
3228858 3230348 Rock.
3230660 3235063 It takes guts climbing back in that ring,<br />knowing you're gonna take a beating.
3237767 3239667 You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
3239936 3241267 How do you know that?
3243173 3245733 The stuff in the basement.
3256720 3258449 Thanks, Paulie.
3263259 3266160 - Hey.<br />- Hey, Rock, how are you?
3267530 3269657 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, good. How are you?
3269833 3271460 - Yeah, fine. This is great.<br />- Good.
3271634 3274296 Listen, some guys over there<br />wanna talk to you.
3274471 3277269 - Okay. You got it.<br />- Okay?
3280710 3283406 - Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.<br />- Our pleasure.
3283580 3285571 - Wanna hear stories?<br />- What kind of stories?
3285782 3288478 Well, a lot of people like to hear<br />these old fight stories.
3288651 3290118 - Maybe later.<br />- Okay.
3290286 3294746 I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.<br />He's Mason Dixors manager.
3294958 3297358 - Will you sit down and join us?<br />- Sure.
3298928 3301726 You know, we have the promotional<br />contract for Mason Dixon...
3301898 3303422 ...who's a big fan.<br />- Really?
3303600 3305727 When he heard you were<br />interested in fighting...
3305902 3308132 ...he thought why not try<br />to work something out?
3308304 3311330 Like a special event.<br />Like a first-class exhibition fight.
3312876 3314969 - Why me?<br />- He respects the hell out of you.
3315145 3319104 All right? And let's be honest,<br />that computer fight got people curious.
3319282 3321716 - This could be very interesting.<br />- I ain't interested...
3321885 3324012 ...in getting, like,<br />mangled and embarrassed.
3324187 3326348 No, that's not gonna happen.<br />Never happen.
3326523 3330687 Truthfully, I was thinking<br />more on a, like...
3331094 3334689 ...miniscule, small level.<br />You know. Small fights, not big fights.
3334964 3338900 Small fights. Things that...<br />Local. You know what I mean?
3339068 3342595 Not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big.<br />Think of it like an exhibition.
3342772 3346333 Think of it as a glorified sparring<br />session. Here's something you'll like.
3346509 3349034 We're gonna donate a portion<br />of the gate to charity.
3349212 3351305 - That's always nice.<br />- It's good to give.
3351481 3352948 Yeah.
3353383 3354975 Where's it taking place?
3355151 3356516 - Las Vegas.<br />- Las Vegas.
3356686 3359917 Nice and warm.<br />This cold's gotta be killing you.
3360123 3362489 - Little stiff.<br />- You move better when you're warmer.
3363092 3364719 - Yeah.<br />- And if nothing else...
3364894 3366987 ...you'll have new stories to tell.
3367263 3370096 - I really gotta think about this.<br />- Absolutely.
3370266 3372666 - Is that okay?<br />- I understand. No problem.
3373036 3375231 I'm gonna go over there.<br />You can order something.
3375405 3377498 - What do you recommend?<br />- It's all edible.
3380410 3383004 Okay. Thanks.
3383613 3387447 We got him. Imagine if Dixon<br />met this bastard in his prime?
3387617 3390085 - He'd kill him. Kill him.<br />- You ain't kidding.
3390620 3392986 Man, I'm confused.
3400196 3402096 I didn't think this was gonna<br />come along.
3402265 3403892 But this is what you wanted, right?
3404067 3406365 I don't know.<br />You know, I talk and I talk.
3406536 3408629 Sometimes I think<br />what I'm saying is true...
3408805 3413139 ...and then I look at myself and I'm<br />not even sure what is true anymore.
3413309 3416301 Because it's like, I pushed<br />this crazy idea about fighting.
3416479 3418037 I mean, what's it all about?
3418214 3421149 Do I really care about standing<br />toe to toe and all that stuff...
3421317 3424912 ...or, like my kid says,<br />is it just, like, ego?
3425088 3428854 Or am I this old pug who's just trying<br />to replace old pain with new pain?
3429025 3431619 I don't know. I don't know.
3433396 3436160 Look, I know<br />I usually don't say a lot.
3436332 3440393 I'm always listening and looking.
3440570 3445507 But who you are, the part of you<br />that's so full of life...
3445675 3447734 ...we all have that feeling, that fire...
3447911 3452405 ...but usually never get a chance<br />to use it. And then it just goes away.
3452582 3457519 But you can. You've got this<br />opportunity, so do it. Why not?
3457687 3461987 I mean, this is who you are.<br />This is who you'll always be.
3462158 3465457 And you don't move aside for nobody<br />until you're ready to move.
3465628 3468426 And it doesn't matter<br />how this looks to other people.
3468598 3470896 All that matters<br />is how it looks to you.
3473069 3474593 Rocky.
3475805 3477796 Rocky, look at me.
3478908 3482344 How it looks to you.
3483346 3485337 And if this is something<br />that you wanna do...
3485515 3489542 ...and if this is something that<br />you gotta do, then you do it.
3490954 3492615 Fighters fight.
3496359 3498793 You're not gonna punch me,<br />are you?
3502398 3506027 Listen, I gotta go before I wear out<br />my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
3507503 3508800 Thanks.
3519649 3521947 Fighters fight, right?
3528191 3532150 It's rare when you get to promote<br />an event bigger than boxing. This is.
3532328 3536094 Skill versus will, with part<br />of the proceeds going to charity.
3536265 3540463 The brainchild of Mason Dixon,<br />to honor past heavyweight champions.
3540637 3543868 Warriors like Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's open it up for questions.
3544040 3545234 Hey, champ!
3545408 3549401 A few great fighters have fought in<br />their 50s, often with disastrous results.
3549579 3551240 Why risk the danger<br />and embarrassment?
3551414 3553848 The smart money says<br />you have virtually no chance.
3554017 3558078 A puncher always has a chance.<br />This fight will be competitive.
3559522 3561513 Why are you doing this, Rocky?
3561691 3565855 I don't know, I'd rather do<br />something I love badly than...
3566029 3570625 Than to feel bad by not<br />doing something you love.
3571401 3574063 Rocky, the press has labeled you<br />a Balboasaurus.
3575938 3577599 How do you feel about that?
3577774 3581733 Let's say the following happens:<br />You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
3581911 3585403 You lose, say a thumb in the eye,<br />you'll be the joke of the decade.
3585581 3588982 You all know that will never happen.<br />This is only an exhibition.
3589152 3592588 Don't go trying to make more out<br />of this than that computer tried.
3594457 3598052 Isn't this sport in enough trouble<br />without these circus events?
3598361 3600659 - Next question.<br />- On the surface, this looks like...
3600830 3603230 ...a cheap bit of ring theater<br />between, no offense...
3603399 3605924 ...a has-been and a man<br />whose own credible legacy...
3606102 3607592 ...and popularity is in doubt.
3607770 3609397 - What's the upside?<br />- Doubt?
3609572 3612097 Upside? I mean...
3612275 3615938 What do you mean, upside?<br />I mean, what do I have to do?
3617180 3619444 You know, I'm 33-0<br />with 30 knockouts.
3619716 3622651 I'm doing you people a favor.<br />I'm having this exhibition for you.
3622819 3625811 You gonna get up here and make<br />a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.
3626489 3628650 I mean, I get pissed,<br />this guy get hurt.
3629592 3631253 See you at the fight.
3635364 3637628 The guy's a joke.<br />He's gonna get crushed.
3647376 3649105 - Look who's here.<br />- How you doing?
3649278 3651542 - Have you seen my father?<br />- He's in the back.
3651714 3654547 This place has never served<br />this many meals. It's unbelievable.
3654717 3658813 You're doing good? Hope you're<br />enjoying everything, all right?
3661057 3662581 Excuse me.
3664260 3667821 How you doing? Glad you come by.
3668397 3669523 Can I talk with you?
3669832 3672323 - Sure.<br />- Can we do it outside?
3677173 3680006 - So you're going through with this?<br />- I start training tomorrow.
3680176 3683407 Hey, Rock.<br />I made some connections.
3683579 3685945 I can make some money<br />on this, endorsements.
3687116 3688310 Absolutely. Do that.
3688718 3691152 - Thank you, Rock. Okay.<br />- Sure.
3691854 3695255 - So you nervous about the fight?<br />- Scared to death.
3695424 3698154 - You don't look scared.<br />- Well, I ain't supposed to.
3698327 3700727 Then you don't have to do it.
3700897 3703195 Yeah, well, I think I do.
3706302 3709465 You know, living with you,<br />it hasn't been easy.
3709639 3712267 People see me<br />but they think of you.
3712441 3715274 Now with all this going on,<br />it's gonna be worse than ever.
3715444 3717378 - It don't have to be.<br />- Sure it does!
3717547 3720277 - Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.<br />- What, my last name?
3720449 3722383 That's the reason I got a decent job.
3722552 3724747 That's why people deal with me<br />in the first place.
3724921 3726582 Now I start to get a little ahead...
3726756 3730692 ...I start to get a little something<br />for myself, and this happens.
3730860 3734125 Now, I'm asking you as a favor<br />not to go through with this.
3734297 3737460 This is gonna end up bad for you,<br />and it's gonna end up bad for me.
3737633 3740363 - You think I'm hurting you?<br />- Yeah. In a way, you are.
3740703 3742568 That's the last thing<br />I ever wanted to do.
3742738 3746174 I know that's not what you wanna do,<br />but that's just the way that it is.
3746342 3749436 Don't you care what people think?<br />Doesrt it bother you that people...
3749612 3752672 ...are making you out to be a joke<br />and that I'll be included in that?
3752849 3755875 Do you think that's right? Do you?
3761891 3766828 You ain't gonna believe this,<br />but you used to fit right here.
3766996 3769226 I'd hold you up<br />and say to your mother:
3769398 3771958 "This kid is gonna be<br />the best kid in the world.
3772134 3775365 This kid is gonna be somebody<br />better than anybody ever knew."
3775538 3778371 And you grew up<br />good and wonderful.
3778541 3781669 It was great just watching,<br />every day was like a privilege.
3781844 3785041 Then the time come for you to be<br />your own man and take on the world...
3785214 3789742 ...and you did. But somewhere<br />along the line, you changed.
3789919 3791181 You stopped being you.
3791354 3794653 You let people stick a finger in<br />your face and tell you you're no good.
3794824 3798487 And when things got hard, you started<br />looking for something to blame...
3798661 3800754 ...like a big shadow.
3802231 3804495 Let me tell you something<br />you already know.
3804667 3806999 The world ain't all<br />sunshine and rainbows.
3807169 3811003 It's a very mean and nasty place,<br />and I don't care how tough you are...
3811173 3814768 ...it will beat you to your knees<br />and keep you there if you let it.
3815411 3819404 You, me or nobody<br />is gonna hit as hard as life.
3819582 3823712 But it ain't about how hard you hit.<br />It's about how hard you can get hit...
3823886 3825285 ...and keep moving forward.
3825454 3828651 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
3828824 3831224 That's how winning is done!
3831694 3834424 If you know what you're won'th,<br />go and get what you're won'th.
3834597 3837862 But you gotta be willing to take<br />the hits, and not pointing fingers...
3838034 3842130 ...saying you ain't where you wanna be<br />because of him or her or anybody!
3842305 3846537 Cowards do that, and that ain't you!<br />You're better than that!
3853282 3856615 I'm always gonna love you<br />no matter what.
3856786 3858651 No matter what happens.
3859021 3861819 You're my son and you're my blood.
3861991 3864755 You're the best thing in my life.
3865995 3869863 But until you start believing in<br />yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.
3874704 3877195 Don't forget to visit your mother.
3927089 3929717 - Yeah, those are beautiful.<br />- Yeah.
3931660 3934754 - You get off early from work?<br />- No.
3935197 3936687 I left.
3937333 3938857 I quit.
3939635 3940932 Quit, why?
3942338 3944704 I wasrt very...
3945341 3948469 I don't know, I just...<br />I didn't fit in there.
3950513 3951946 I understand.
3956619 3959884 - So, what are you gonna do?<br />- Right now?
3961390 3963984 Right now I'd rather be with you.
3966328 3968125 Is that all right?
3969465 3971262 Yeah.
3971600 3974433 It's been a long time<br />since I seen a fight.
3986282 3986348 You know all there is<br />to know about fighting...
3986348 3988509 You know all there is<br />to know about fighting...
3988684 3991847 ...so there's no sense us going down<br />that same old road again.
3992021 3996151 To beat this guy, you need speed.<br />You don't have it.
3997660 4001596 And your knees can't take the<br />pounding, so hard running is out.
4001764 4005495 And you got arthritis in your neck.<br />And you've got calcium deposits...
4005668 4008967 ...on most of your joints,<br />so sparring is out.
4009905 4011372 I had that problem.
4012274 4017473 So what we'll be calling on is good<br />old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.
4017646 4022310 Horsepower. Heavy-duty,<br />cast-iron, pile-driving punches...
4022485 4025511 ...that will have to hurt so much<br />they'll rattle his ancestors.
4026088 4027817 Every time you hit him with a shot...
4027990 4030959 ...it's gotta feel like he tried kissing<br />the express train.
4032294 4036230 Yeah! Let's start building<br />some hurting bombs.
4068531 4071364 - Yeah, you'll get it.<br />- You can do it, Rocko!
4107236 4108794 Getting stronger!
4111207 4112936 - Up! Up! Up!<br />- Come on!
4114877 4116139 Go!
4121250 4124083 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah! Yeah!
4126822 4128221 Come on, Rocko!
4135631 4137929 Come on. Come on.<br />Let's hit them. Hit them.
4143472 4144769 You can do it, Rock.
4147910 4149104 Getting stronger!
4160155 4163022 - Up, up, up!<br />- Go! Go!
4164193 4165660 All right!
4166195 4167457 Yeah! Yeah!
4187182 4188809 Yeah!
4198594 4202655 Rocky Balboa, 217!
4203399 4209531 The undisputed heavyweight<br />champion, Mason Dixon, 221!
4212541 4215533 Thank you very much.<br />I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
4221650 4226314 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
4231860 4233953 - Know how much money is in this?<br />- A lot of it.
4234129 4236495 Imagine trying to clean this place.
4236665 4238064 - No, seriously.<br />- Balboa!
4241737 4244501 You guys, I'll catch up<br />with you all later, okay?
4244673 4246868 Robert, why don't<br />you hang with me?
4248043 4250978 - How you doing, champ?<br />- I'm good.
4252481 4255109 No reason for neither one of us<br />to get hurt in this fight.
4255284 4258276 I'll do my best to carry you,<br />make sure you save face.
4258454 4260251 There'd be no embarrassment.
4260422 4264722 But I promise you, you try to press me,<br />you hit me, you hurt me...
4264927 4268454 ...you hit me low, cheap-shot me,<br />I'll get you out of there.
4269898 4274062 You know, a lot of people come<br />to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
4274269 4275566 It's already over.
4275738 4277638 Ain't nothing over till it's over.
4277806 4279467 What's that from, the '80s?
4279641 4282007 That's probably the '70s.
4284880 4286404 Just remember what I said.
4287916 4289941 Hey, yo, champ.
4290185 4291812 Yo, ain't you a little scared?
4292788 4294619 I don't get scared.
4297693 4300127 I think you try a little harder<br />when you're scared.
4300729 4303926 This is what has worked for me.
4304666 4307032 - I ain't scared.<br />- Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?
4307202 4309602 Come on, let's see what you got.<br />Come on.
4309772 4311205 Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
4326889 4328584 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
4328757 4330418 - How you doing?<br />- I was just thinking.
4330592 4332890 - Did you wanna come in?<br />- No, no, no, it's okay.
4333061 4335222 I just wanted to...
4335397 4338195 ...I dor t know, come by and wish you<br />good luck for tomorrow.
4338367 4340198 - Thanks.<br />- Yeah.
4340369 4342337 I brought you something.
4342504 4344836 I hope you don't mind,<br />I took it from the restaurant.
4345007 4346804 - No.<br />- Thanks.
4346975 4348738 Adrian.
4348911 4351675 Yeah. Thought she would<br />keep you safe.
4351847 4354281 Yeah. Yeah, she always<br />brought me luck.
4354450 4356179 Yeah.
4356885 4361948 I wanted to say thanks for everything<br />you've done for me and my kid.
4362724 4364658 You've been great and...
4369064 4370964 You know, tomorrow...
4372434 4376427 ...you're gonna prove that the last thing<br />to age on somebody is their heart.
4378474 4380669 - I'll try.<br />- You go show them.
4380843 4382504 Thank you.
4403732 4405529 The heavyweight championship<br />has been...
4405701 4409262 ...one of sports' most coveted titles<br />for 120 years.
4409605 4412005 Two-time heavyweight champion<br />Rocky Balboa...
4412174 4415268 ...the Philadelphia slugger,<br />renowned for his cast-iron jaw...
4415444 4418208 ...ferocious body attack<br />and will of steel...
4418714 4421581 ...all of which have carried<br />the smaller fighter to victories...
4421750 4425151 ...over the years against<br />physically superior opponents.
4425320 4427914 And Mason Dixon, the current<br />heavyweight title holder...
4428090 4431457 ...with all the speed, determination<br />and confidence any fighter could want.
4431627 4435586 But many still question whether<br />he has the heart of a true champion...
4435764 4439564 ...never having been pushed to go<br />the distance. Tonight, we find out.
4441169 4443637 Here at the Mandalay Bay<br />Event Center in Las Vegas...
4443805 4445636 ...for the much-anticipated<br />showdown...
4445807 4447741 ...between Mason<br />"The Line" Dixon...
4447910 4450811 ...and Rocky<br />"The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
4451313 4454248 Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with<br />Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...
4454416 4457613 ...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel<br />in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...
4457786 4460983 ...one of the most outrageous and<br />compelling events in boxing history.
4461156 4464887 The unappreciated heavyweight<br />champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...
4465060 4466823 ...putting his reputation<br />on the line...
4468163 4469960 ...against legendary ex-champion,<br />Rocky Balboa.
4471300 4474360 Even though most see this as more<br />of a glorified sparring session...
4474536 4476504 ...the energy in the room is electric.
4476672 4478765 Larry, why is this billed<br />as an exhibition?
4478941 4483105 Wild guess: So they wouldn't<br />have to call it an execution.
4483912 4489111 Zacariah 4:6 says,<br />"It is not by strength, not by might...
4489284 4493050 ...but by his spirit<br />we have already claimed the victory...
4493221 4495917 ...in our Lord Jesus Christ."
4496558 4498253 Good luck, Rocky.
4498427 4500691 Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.
4511807 4515072 Nobody's expecting much, I think,<br />from the way-past-his-prime...
4515243 4517336 ...former champ, Rocky Balboa.
4517813 4521078 Rock, I gotta talk to you.
4521850 4527686 Look, I know you got a lot of stuff<br />you gotta get out of your system.
4528590 4533152 Tonight you do it. Right?<br />Get rid of the damn beast...
4533328 4538163 ...let it be done, once and for all.<br />Please, I love you.
4539067 4542696 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
4547509 4551912 There go the lights. The buzz is<br />building toward a roaring crescendo.
4567829 4570024 Where did that come from?
4570198 4573190 I told you. I love Sinatra.
4573869 4575894 He's very good, Sinatra.
4576071 4579097 - Let's go.<br />- Very good.
4581343 4585837 And here comes Rocky Balboa,<br />veteran of the wars...
4586048 4588710 ...here for one more last hurrah.
4588884 4591819 Or the Last Supper, perhaps,<br />with him as the main course.
4591987 4594615 What's that music?<br />You can't be serious.
4594790 4597520 "High Hopes"?<br />Talk about wishful thinking.
4597726 4601184 Well, maybe no hopes is more<br />realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.
4602030 4605227 Look at the Italian Stallion.<br />Cool and relaxed.
4605400 4609131 Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,<br />and they don't care at all.
4609304 4613070 This is about his pride and dignity<br />and his punch, guys.
4613308 4615833 The last thing to go<br />is a guy's punch.
4616011 4619469 Rocky always has<br />that puncher's chance.
4623819 4627915 Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,<br />the people's champion.
4628090 4630524 Prediction, guys:<br />For at least two rounds...
4630692 4632421 ...Dixors gonna have<br />his hands full.
4632594 4636621 Two whole rounds? We have<br />a cockeyed optimist in the house.
4637599 4639430 - How you doing?<br />- The crowd wants to see...
4639601 4641262 ...something real, or at least...
4641436 4643461 Rocky Balboa just asked me<br />how I'm doing.
4643638 4648302 I grew up watching this guy. I never<br />thought I'd be calling one of his fights.
4648810 4651506 This is unbelievable.<br />I'm a fan, I can't help it.
4651680 4654308 Now here comes Mason Dixon.
4688550 4691018 Mason Dixon establishing<br />his presence in the ring.
4691186 4694952 And suddenly now a conversation<br />breaking out at ringside.
4695123 4697853 Mike Tyson calling out<br />Mason "The Line" Dixon.
4698026 4700551 You can't call no shots here.<br />I'm the champ.
4700729 4703095 You not doing nothing.<br />This is charity work.
4703265 4706325 You got that midget<br />with you right there.
4711039 4714531 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />welcome to the Mandalay Bay...
4716144 4718669 ...resort and casino of Las Vegas.
4718847 4722305 And a special main event<br />of the evening...
4722484 4725783 ...10 rounds of<br />heavyweight excitement...
4725954 4728388 ...sanctioned by the Nevada<br />State Athletic Commission.
4728557 4732425 And when the bell rings, the referee<br />in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
4734196 4737324 And now, for the thousands<br />in attendance...
4737499 4743233 ...and the millions watching around<br />the world, ladies and gentlemen...
4743405 4748968 ...let's get ready to rumble!
4751379 4754542 Introducing first,<br />fighting out of the blue corner...
4754716 4759415 ...wearing black with gold,<br />official weight, 217 pounds.
4759588 4764218 His professional record, 57 victories<br />including 54 knockouts...
4764392 4767418 ...with 23 defeats and one draw.
4767596 4770759 He is the fighting pride<br />of Philadelphia...
4771032 4775401 ...the two-time heavyweight<br />champion of the world...
4775570 4777663 ..."The Italian Stallion"...
4777839 4782435 ...R ocky...
4782611 4784977 ...Balboa!
4788016 4789608 Hope he gets his head busted.
4791653 4793587 Shut up.
4796358 4799156 Across the ring,<br />fighting out of the red corner...
4799327 4803127 ...wearing white with blue,<br />official weight, 221 pounds.
4803365 4808359 He has a perfect professional record,<br />consisting of 33 bouts...
4808536 4811801 ...33 victories,<br />including 30 knockouts.
4811973 4813941 Originally from Tampa, florida...
4814109 4817135 ...but now fighting out<br />of Las Vegas, Nevada...
4817312 4821646 ...the reigning undisputed,<br />undefeated...
4821816 4824785 ...heavyweight champion<br />of the world...
4824953 4828445 ...Mason "The Line"...
4828623 4832582 ...Dixon!
4836731 4838392 All right, gentlemen.
4838566 4841933 All right, Mason, Rocky. We went<br />over the rules in the dressing room.
4842103 4846130 I expect a good, clean fight. Watch<br />the kidney punches, rabbit punches...
4846308 4849505 ...Iow blows, be careful with those.<br />Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
4849678 4853375 Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair<br />but I'm firm. Touch them up!
4853548 4856108 - Enjoy the ride.<br />- The champ is not in the best shape...
4856284 4859583 ...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans<br />to phone this in and go home early.
4859754 4862188 - That wouldn't be a surprise.<br />- Glad you could make it.
4862357 4864985 One thing about Rocky<br />we know for sure:
4865160 4867390 This guy's showing up in shape.
4867562 4870395 - The old mars crazy.<br />- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
4870565 4872499 - Okay.<br />- Take it easy. This is an exhibition.
4872667 4874134 All right? Do it to him.
4874302 4877499 You got three rounds to set a pace.<br />Every time you hit him, make a dent.
4877672 4879640 - Got it.<br />- The moments before...
4879808 4883300 ...a Rocky Balboa fight?<br />I can't believe it's here!
4884446 4885674 Round one begins.
4885847 4889544 If old George foreman shocked<br />the world with one punch...
4889718 4891845 ...why can't old Rocky Balboa?
4892020 4894352 And as much excitement<br />as there is in the arena...
4894522 4896888 ...there's a sense of foreboding<br />as well.
4901229 4904892 And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon<br />goes to work with his jab as though...
4905066 4908934 ...he's fighting against the number one<br />challenger in the heavyweight division.
4909371 4911271 See, this is to be expected early on.
4911439 4914135 You knew the champ would<br />control the distance with his jab...
4914309 4916334 ...his height, his range.
4917712 4920806 Balboa looking to get in a shot,<br />misses wildly.
4920982 4922813 Did you like that?
4923284 4926412 It looks like a speed bag<br />against a punching bag.
4926621 4928213 Rocky's understandably frustrated...
4928390 4930722 ...but he came out of retirement<br />to get into a fight.
4930892 4933452 Guys named Rocky<br />don't like to be toyed with.
4933628 4935323 One punch could still turn it around.
4935530 4938624 Apparently he forgot<br />his arthritis meds this morning.
4938933 4940400 Rocky misses.
4940769 4944500 There's a meat-seeking missile<br />on the point of the chin by the champ.
4944672 4947402 - More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.<br />- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
4947575 4950908 And there's a hard right hand<br />and a left and a right by Balboa!
4951079 4954048 He drives Dixon into the ropes<br />with a series of shots!
4954215 4956649 And the crowd goes berserk!
4961489 4965755 Dixon punishing Balboa for<br />the temerity of landing those shots.
4969264 4973860 It's toe to toe in the corner.<br />Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
4980608 4983475 Balboa landing potent combinations<br />to the head of the champion.
4983812 4985040 A wake-up call for Dixon.
4985213 4986840 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm all right.
4987015 4990212 - The mars got bricks in his gloves.<br />- Where's the stuff in the basement?
4990385 4992580 - It's still there.<br />- He came to battle, okay?
4992754 4994221 - Trying to knock me out.<br />- Listen.
4994389 4996823 If there's a bone he can break,<br />he's gonna do it.
4996991 4999289 - Give the man respect.<br />- What about my respect?
4999461 5002294 CompuBox numbers<br />tell the grisly story here.
5002464 5005524 Balboa landed nine of 13<br />punches in that round.
5005700 5010865 Dixon landed an incredible<br />59 out of 69.
5011039 5014497 - Why don't you listen to me?<br />- Rocky's been here a million times.
5014676 5017873 Coming out to start a round after<br />he took a beating in the previous one.
5018046 5021209 - Remember what I said, okay?<br />- I warned him. I warned him.
5022283 5027220 He's tired. His legs are going fast,<br />or already gone.
5027388 5031950 And what's truly extraordinary<br />is that Rocky can still take it.
5032127 5037064 The boxing commission, which<br />was criticized for licensing him...
5037232 5041464 ...would be massacred<br />if something happened to Rocky.
5044772 5047434 And a monstrous straight left hand!<br />Down goes Rocky!
5047642 5049940 And that could conceivably<br />be the end of the fight!
5050111 5053945 That could be the exhibition<br />right there. But no. Balboa up.
5054115 5058415 Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants<br />to continue, and Rocky says yes.
5058586 5061453 Even Rocky Balboa could be<br />too brave for his own good.
5061623 5065218 Dixon comes right back to try to<br />finish it. Balboa almost went down!
5065393 5067384 Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
5067562 5070087 As Dixon lands these brutal shots.
5070265 5072825 - Cover up! Cover up!<br />- Open shots at close range.
5073001 5075526 Right and left hands,<br />and down goes Balboa!
5075703 5079070 Perhaps for the last time<br />in his fighting career!
5079240 5081640 - That should do it.<br />- Three! Four!
5081809 5084141 Five! Six!
5084312 5085939 Get up! Get up!<br />- Seven!
5086114 5087911 Eight! Nine!
5089350 5092547 - How do you feel, man? You okay?<br />- Now Rocky is furious with himself.
5092720 5095314 He convinces Cortez<br />he wants to keep fighting.
5095490 5097355 Dixors pointing at the ref to end it.
5097525 5099618 Rocky waving his arms<br />and saying he's fine.
5099794 5101955 - He wants to go on!<br />- Let it go! Let it go!
5102897 5105957 And Balboa comes back!<br />With a left and a right...
5106134 5110036 ...and bulls Dixon into the ropes<br />for the second round in a row!
5111239 5113799 Back comes Dixon<br />with brutal left-hand shots.
5113975 5116170 - Dixon hurt his hand there!<br />- Go after him!
5116344 5118005 This is Rocky's best chance!
5118179 5120409 The champ obviously hurt<br />his hand on Rocky's hip!
5120582 5124416 And Balboa immediately going to<br />work to the body! Huge right hook!
5124586 5128147 Balboa ripping away at Dixors body!<br />These are big punches.
5128389 5132120 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5133528 5134586 Yes!
5137031 5141491 Rocky Balboa has knocked the<br />reigning heavyweight champion down!
5141669 5143569 - You hurt him!<br />- Mason "The Line" Dixon...
5143738 5145797 ...has never taken<br />this kind of punishment...
5145974 5148135 ...in his entire professional career!
5148309 5152302 Maybe he's clearing his head, but<br />the body shots really caved in his ribs.
5152480 5155142 Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
5155316 5158843 Another counterhook by Balboa,<br />followed by two more!
5159020 5161511 Dixon fires back his own hooks!<br />Now Rocky's stunned.
5161689 5164214 It's an all-out war along the ropes...
5164392 5169420 ...as round two comes to a close<br />amid a giant tumult in the ring!
5170131 5171723 Incredible.
5171899 5173560 All right!
5173735 5175532 Welcome to Rockyland.
5179641 5182075 - How's the hand?<br />- My hand's broken.
5184178 5186203 We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
5186381 5188679 It will numb up on you<br />in a few rounds.
5188850 5192445 Once that hand numbs up,<br />Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
5192620 5195020 Until then, here is Rocky's chance.
5195189 5197919 - No reverse!<br />- Take the pain, champ.
5198092 5200890 Stay on him! Everybody thought<br />this was a joke, including me!
5201062 5203690 Now nobody's laughing!<br />Stay on him! You go get him!
5204465 5206365 Go out strong!
5218179 5219168 Keep him off you!
5223051 5224040 That's it! That's it!
5238499 5240558 You won that round.<br />Break him down.
5246240 5248231 Bomb him! Bomb him!
5253948 5255142 Yeah!
5259087 5261385 Just keep throwing them bombs!
5273167 5274327 Come on.
5281876 5283935 You can do this.
5284812 5287576 Rocko. Rocko.
5296190 5298556 Yeah, come on, go!
5355616 5357481 Go through him! Run over him!
5372934 5374162 Unload on him!
5376037 5377026 Get down, Mason!
5388850 5390841 They're leaving nothing<br />on the table, guys.
5391052 5395546 The fans are still standing. They may<br />not be able to sit down for a week.
5395723 5398487 - You're doing great!<br />- I'm doing better than I thought.
5398659 5402459 - You sure he's okay?<br />- I've had worse.
5402630 5406361 Toe to toe, one round to go. Who<br />would've believed this was possible?
5406534 5408900 - Can you see out of that eye?<br />- Let me talk to him.
5409303 5411328 Don't take any more chances<br />than you have to.
5411506 5414475 There's nothing more to prove, Pop.<br />There's nothing more to prove.
5414642 5416769 I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
5416944 5418502 You can do it, Rocko!
5418713 5421011 - One more round, we go home.<br />- Okay, then do it.
5421182 5424709 There's an old saying that<br />every great champion has...
5424886 5430188 ...one great fight left in him,<br />and Rocky is proving it so far.
5430358 5433555 - Come on. Touch them up.<br />- Rocko! The last round of your life!
5433728 5435389 - Come on, guys.<br />- The last round!
5435563 5437929 Come on. Touch them up, let's go.<br />Touch them up.
5438599 5441500 - You are one crazy old man.<br />- You'll get there.
5441969 5443129 Let's go.
5443437 5446668 Tenth round of a scheduled 10.<br />Who would ever have dreamed...
5446841 5451642 ...that Rocky Balboa would still be<br />in this quote, "exhibition," against...
5451812 5454576 ...the heavyweight champion?<br />- You can do it! Come on!
5454749 5459083 This fight is as though Dixon<br />got on-the-job training in courage.
5460187 5462951 - Cover up! Cover up!<br />- They're both in a pain-free zone!
5463124 5466355 These guys are fighting<br />in another dimension right now!
5466527 5470588 Beyond belief! Balboa just walking<br />straight into Dixors punches.
5470765 5473359 Target practice for Dixon.
5476804 5479272 They're exchanging right hooks!<br />Balboa's drilled!
5479440 5482671 Here comes Dixon! He's exhausted<br />from just punching the man!
5484545 5485876 Knock this bum out, Mase!
5498426 5502453 What is it you said to the kid?<br />It ain't about how hard you hit.
5502630 5506657 It' about how hard you can get hit<br />and keep moving forward.
5506968 5510665 How much you can take<br />and keep moving forward.
5510838 5512635 - Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!<br />- Get up.
5512807 5514798 - Let's go! Get up!<br />- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5515009 5517705 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
5517945 5519845 Get up.
5540901 5544496 Another monster body shot. Rocky's<br />ancestors must have felt that one.
5544672 5546731 Come on, Rocky!<br />Start moving those hands!
5546974 5548669 Less than two minutes to go.
5548843 5551209 The crowd is astonished<br />that Balboa got up.
5551379 5553870 - Come on!<br />- Turn it over! All the way through!
5554315 5556010 And retaliates with fury!
5559553 5560747 Chop him down!
5564425 5566086 Come on, Rocky! Come on!
5568529 5570087 Take him out now!
5571232 5573291 They're trading shots again!
5573467 5577062 Balboa is trying to hit<br />anything and anywhere!
5579407 5580738 Win it! Win it!
5589884 5590484 Yes!
5590484 5591382 Yes!
5600161 5602994 You're a great champion.<br />You got heart.
