28362 30598 -Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
50018 52085 -Is it morning?
52185 54622 -No, keep sleeping.
100068 101268 -Fucking asshole.
102369 103437 Hey, I got you, dick.
103538 107041 50, BT8, fucking contacts, man.
107140 110011 BT, what'd I say?
110110 111746 We'll get 'em next time.
131532 132567 -Yeah.
136604 139272 All right, I'll be right there.
141208 143143 Mikey.
147447 150084 -So, uh, Mrs. Colefield says<br />that --
150183 152120 -Alleges.<br />-Daisy.
152219 153688 -What? It's her<br />word against mine.
153788 155590 -Give it a rest. She hasn't<br />gotten five words out.
155690 157457 -And honestly, I don't think<br />we should be trusting a woman
157558 160695 who uses the word "irregardless"<br />in a school setting,
160795 162162 a professional educator.
162262 165733 -Uh, she alleges<br />that Daisy pushed her.
165833 166834 -Ow.<br />-That didn't hurt.
166934 168036 -You can't tell me what hurts.
168136 169469 -Pushed, as in?
169570 172940 -Physically, two hands,<br />in front of the class.
173041 175242 -Is that true?<br />-No.
175342 178613 I tried to go to the bathroom,<br />which is my human right,
178713 182249 and she used her disgusting<br />body to block my way.
182349 184919 Ask anyone in that<br />class. Ask Bailey.
185019 189524 They'll all tell you that<br />I asked nicely three times.
189624 191726 She actually said I couldn't go.
192292 193728 I mean, like, what?
193828 195295 You just want me to pee right<br />here in this seat?
195395 197497 -Okay.<br />-Are you gonna clean it up?
198365 200134 And I didn't shove.
200233 202603 Shoving is this, "Bitch, move."
202704 204105 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
204204 206574 -I did this --
206674 210578 "Will you move your<br />gross body, please?"
215315 216751 Fuck this.
222090 223858 -Maria, I'm so sorry.
223958 225492 So is she suspended or...
225593 228395 -For physically<br />assaulting a teacher,
229429 231833 it's a mandatory expulsion.
233568 235335 I better check on her.
235435 238238 -No, I'll do it.<br />You stay.
242110 243511 -I'm sorry, Dan.
243611 247347 I know you all have<br />a lot on your plate.
247447 252120 -Look, uh, i-is there<br />anything, anything we can do?
252220 257290 Uh, community service,<br />letter of apology?
257992 259160 Can I give you a kidney?
260628 262964 -It's just that St. Mary's<br />tuition is --
263064 266399 -Maybe under the circumstances,
266501 268603 I can try to talk<br />to Mrs. Colefield,
268703 272940 and if she's amenable to it,<br />which I'm not sure she will be,
273040 275810 we might be able to<br />transmute Daisy's expulsion
275910 277444 to a two-week suspension.
277545 278579 -Oh, thank you so much.
278679 280915 -I haven't talked to her yet.
281516 284619 Daisy has had plenty<br />of chances already.
285418 286821 This is her last one.
288288 291391 Did you reach out to the<br />therapist I recommended?
294729 298132 -I have<br />no idea what to do.
298232 299901 -Come on, get<br />out of the street.
300001 301702 -Are you kidding?
305405 308042 Do we send her to one of<br />those military schools?
309544 312479 I just hate the idea of<br />somebody screaming in her face.
313948 316017 -Maria said, if she<br />sees the counselor,
316117 318085 she could just suspend her.
319053 321722 -Okay, then we gotta do that.
324158 325827 How are we gonna do that?
331498 333701 What are you doing?<br />-Hey.
336037 338338 -Whoo, whoo.
343945 344979 -Hey.
346314 350483 Hey, hello.
350585 352987 When the fuck do you<br />plan to end this shit?
354222 357457 -Uh, we go until 6:00.
357558 359193 -We can't hear ourselves think.
359293 361863 -It's -- It's not really<br />my call.
361963 364265 -Can you be quieter?
364364 366634 -Uh...
366734 369402 I, uh, I d-- I --<br />I don't think so.
369871 373007 -That's just great.<br />So what are we gonna do now?
375042 377778 What the fuck are you<br />laughing about, dipshit?
381115 382717 Shit.
396530 398599 -You're late.<br />-And now we have...
398699 399800 -Shh.
399901 401369 -...Mrs. Mueller's after-school<br />drama club.
401468 402637 -Shh.
430031 432133 -None of these kids<br />have star quality.
455589 458626 -When I get mad, I stomp<br />my feet and dance it out.
460394 462096 -When I'm mad, I take<br />three deep breaths
462196 464632 and tell my mom, "I'm mad."
466334 469070 -When I'm mad, I play<br />soccer 'cause soccer's fun.
475810 477611 -If I'm the only one<br />watching this,
477712 478846 can I switch to<br />something else?
478946 480214 -I'm watching.<br />-I'm watching it.
480314 481515 - Well...
483818 486654 These murder shows are so sad.
487822 491826 -Oh, I ran into Ms. Pruitt<br />at the Jewel today.
491926 495596 She suggested you start<br />looking at the "Audrey" songs.
496998 499867 -I'm not gonna audition<br />for the musical this year.
501035 502303 -Why not?
502403 503537 -'Cause it's fucking stupid.
503637 505573 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
507842 510811 Maybe you'll change your mind.<br />-I won't.
512880 515750 Well, don't pick up<br />hitchhikers, dumbass.
521655 524225 -Shit, the meeting with<br />the lawyer tomorrow's
524325 525726 in the middle of my shift.
525826 527161 -We can reschedule.
527261 528729 -No, no, no more delays.
528829 531365 -Could give us more time.
531465 532933 -Time for what?
533034 534368 -To think about
534468 537038 if we wanna go through<br />with the lawsuit.
537138 539673 -Why wouldn't w-w-w...
547381 549417 Wow.
579847 582183 If you don't want to<br />go through with it...
583651 584885 -Hmm?
586654 590791 -If you're not<br />committed, tell me now.
607741 609176 I'll call in.
643077 644245 -Dan.
645346 646747 Let the cars go.
660127 661795 -Hey, uh, Mikey,<br />I got a -- I got --
661896 663430 I'll be right back.
664599 666233 Yeah, Jim.<br /><i>-Hi, honey.</i>

701503 703337 -Yeah, keep it going, asshole.
703437 704872 There we go.
704972 706707 -Hey, the fuck are you doing?
706807 708242 -You wanna come out?<br />-The fuck --

709910 713948 -Shut up, stop,<br />stop, stop, just stop.
717418 719720 -Okay, I'm gonna go<br />ahead and delete that.
719820 721121 -Did you fucking see that?
721222 723991 Did you see that?<br />Did you get that?
725259 727662 This was your last<br />day, fuck wit.
727761 729997 Good luck finding<br />another menial job.

840441 842276 Everyone, this is...
843611 844878 -Dan.
844978 846880 -Dan is the new Aaron.
846980 849016 Everyone is replaceable.
849116 851952 -Here's a space,<br />dear heart. Come on.
852052 853454 -Uh, no, I-I--<br />-Oh, come on.
853555 855889 -I'm not --<br />I-I don't -- I'm not an actor.
856691 858593 -Can you read?
858693 860127 -Did he audition?
860227 861929 -Do you have<br />a monologue we can see?
862029 863698 -Something classic?
863798 865199 I should, uh --
865299 867301 -What?<br />Where do you have to be?
868335 870805 Sit down and play<br />pretend for an hour,
870904 872540 and then you can...<br />-Yeah.
872640 874375 -...go back to your life.
886019 888021 -Strike them down!<br />Beat them down!
888122 891826 - Part, fools.<br />Put up your swords.
891925 893661 You know not what you do.
893762 895630 -Peace? I hate the word.
895730 897231 -That's cut. Lucian,<br />you know that.
897331 900568 -As I hate hell, all Montagues.
902504 904706 -Aah!<br />-Ohh!
904806 907107 -And Capulet enters.
913648 914816 -That's your line.
914915 916551 That's you.<br />-Oh.
918986 920421 What noise --<br />-Louder.
920522 922956 -Remember, all the way<br />to the back of the house.
924626 926193 -What noise is this?
926293 928830 Give me my long sword, ho.
928929 930264 -Okay.
931766 933500 -Seriously?
933601 939574 -Uh, the hardest part is<br />getting the first line out.
939674 941475 After that, it's all downhill.
944612 946748 -No phones. Jesus Christ.<br />-Phones on silent, please.
949617 951151 -Hey, hun.<br /><i>-Hi, honey.</i>
951251 952620 -How'd it -- How'd it go?
952720 954622 <i>-Okay, just finished.</i>
954722 958593 <i>Deposition date is set,</i><br /><i>the 12th of next month.</i>

966668 968101 <i>-Where are you?</i>
968202 970003 -Uh, I'm finishing<br />up at the site.
970103 972507 - Hey, are you in or out?
972607 974107 <i>-Is that Mikey?</i>
974208 977579 -Uh, I'll pick up some<br />champagne on the way home.
984719 987488 -And end of act two.
988957 990592 God, how is there<br />still so much left?
990692 993628 All right, act three tomorrow.<br />Everybody, please be on time.
993728 995295 -Welcome aboard, sir.
995395 997565 -Good work today, Daniel.<br />-Uh, I'm not, uh, going --
997665 1000902 -So rehearsal schedules, we<br />work, uh, evenings and weekends
1001001 1002402 because everyone's<br />got real jobs.
1002504 1003905 -I hope they told<br />you it doesn't pay.
1004004 1005038 -Well, I don't --<br />-Actually,
1005138 1006508 it ends up being a loss.
1006608 1008041 -Do you have a family?<br />It's better if you don't.
1008141 1009343 -Just helping out for tonight.
1009443 1011378 -That's what I said<br />three years ago.
1011478 1013815 -Any interest in<br />running the light board?
1013915 1015650 -Uh...<br />-Ah, had to ask.
1015750 1017552 Good to meet you, Dave.<br />-Other people's props.
1017652 1019521 -It's just a plastic sword.<br />What am I --
1019621 1021455 -So what? It has nothing to do<br />with it being plastic.
1021556 1023992 You're not supposed to<br />touch other people's props.
1024091 1025359 You're not supposed to<br />play with the props.
1025459 1026961 -Okay, okay.
1034769 1037371 -Give me my long sword, ho.
1043277 1045680 Give me my long sword, ho.
1046681 1048282 Ho, ho.
1049817 1052219 Ho-ho.
1055857 1058158 -Want more?<br />-No, this is gross.
1058258 1060060 I don't even know<br />how anyone eats it.
1060160 1064064 -Jim said -- he said we need<br />a few prep meetings
1064164 1065934 before the actual deposition
1066034 1068870 to go over any questions<br />they might ask.
1068970 1071171 -Do I get to testify?
1071271 1073073 -They're gonna depose all of us.
1073173 1074408 -Hell, yeah.<br />-You shouldn't have
1074509 1076076 to say anything.<br />-Look, look, look.
1076176 1077545 All we need to do is<br />just tell the truth.
1077645 1079881 -I can't wait.<br />I'm so fucking ready.
1079981 1082115 -Hey.<br />-Hey, come on.
1082215 1083851 That's it. You're --<br />You're grounded.
1083952 1085218 -I'm already grounded.
1085319 1087087 -Then you're grounded<br />till you're 18.
1088455 1090290 -Can I get a pant suit?
1090390 1093260 I don't think I have anything<br />really courtroom appropriate.
1093360 1095630 -What about the<br />dress you wore to GG's funeral?
1095730 1098967 -No, that just screams<br />bereaved little girl,
1099067 1101002 not power bitch.
1101101 1102637 -Oh, oh, come on.<br />-Hey, hey, hey.
1102737 1104639 Come on, come on.
1104739 1106774 -I just wanted a sip.
1109176 1111779 I'm gonna say it<br />all right to her,
1111879 1114281 like, "That's it, look at me."
1120588 1121623 <i>-Okay, honey.</i>
1122857 1124124 -Come in.
1124224 1126628 -Night, honey.<br />-Night.
1130531 1135302 -Hey, uh, do you know this<br />play, "Romeo and Juliet"?
1136336 1138506 -Two households<br />both alike in dignity
1138606 1141241 in fair Verona where<br />we lay our scene
1141341 1143611 from ancient grudge<br />break new mutiny
1143711 1146581 where civil blood makes<br />civil hands unclean.
1146681 1149483 From forth the fatal<br />loins of these two foes,
1149584 1153121 a pair of star-crossed<br />lovers take their life
1153253 1155590 whose misadventured<br />piteous overthrows
1155690 1159961 doth, with their death,<br />bury their parents' strife.
1160061 1161395 - Whew, whoa.
1161495 1162997 -We had to learn<br />it for AP English.
1163097 1165900 -Well, uh, I --<br />I've never seen it.
1166000 1168836 -Seriously?<br />The movie's a classic.
1168936 1170805 It's old, but you<br />know, it's good.
1179847 1183483 Leonardo DiCaprio does not<br />look like that anymore.
1189322 1193728 -Hmm, they're so young.
1193828 1196263 -They're, like, my age.
1206874 1207909 -Hey.
1210277 1212914 I told you he was a narcissist.
1214649 1215850 Dad.
1215950 1217752 He's probably a sociopath.
1217852 1220387 He, like, never yawns<br />when anyone else does.
1222924 1225560 -What happens to them?
1225660 1227028 -You don't know?
1227128 1229296 -I know they get together.
1229396 1231866 -I just told you<br />in the prologue.
1231966 1233901 Here's a hint.
1234001 1235469 It's a tragedy.
1238740 1242910 Oh, yeah, a really<br />high percentage, too,
1243010 1245012 like one in 10 people you know.
1250084 1253453 -Can you put that<br />on silent, please?
1253554 1255590 -I don't know how.
1262063 1264498 Dad, this place is for kids.
1266901 1268836 -Daisy, please come in.
1272907 1275209 - Uh, am I supposed<br />to go in there or something?
1275308 1278646 -Some parents choose to.<br />It's really up to you.
1280915 1283017 -I'll be back in an hour.
1337738 1342375 -It's just like the island<br />of misfit toys, right?
1342475 1344145 -Shake it, shake it, shake<br />it, shake it, shake it,
1344245 1346047 shake it, shake it.
1346147 1348816 -They're good people, really.<br />I'm the only asshole.
1350151 1352119 -You don't seem<br />like an asshole.
1352220 1353888 -See, you are a good actor.
1353988 1355355 I almost believed that.
1357225 1359293 -Uh, how, uh, long
1359392 1363130 have you all been doing skits?
1363231 1364699 -A few years.
1364799 1366399 I used to do this<br />professionally,
1366499 1369369 but when I moved home,<br />I didn't wanna stop.
1374441 1376711 It's not all just<br />Shakespeare, you know.
1379647 1382116 -Well, uh, good luck.
1386354 1390725 -Hey, Dan, you know<br />why I asked you to help?
1391959 1394494 - 'Cause I can read.
1395630 1399399 -It seemed like you<br />might want a chance
1399499 1404672 of being somebody<br />else for a while.
1425425 1426761 -How'd it go?
1426861 1428461 -She said that we<br />could just sit there
1428562 1430998 for, like, a whole hour<br />in silence if I wanted.
1431098 1434467 I bet no one's ever<br />actually done that before.
1434568 1436337 -Look, next time<br />you have to talk.
1436436 1437805 -No, I don't.
1437905 1439307 -Yeah, uh, we're<br />paying 150 a session.
1439407 1440641 -You are?<br />-Yes.
1440741 1443010 -Well, stop doing that.<br />-We can't.
1444378 1446614 -Well, I think it's<br />a bad investment.
1448616 1450584 Oh, I drew you something.
1468269 1469971 You know my friend, Anastasia?
1470071 1472840 Her whole family goes<br />to family therapy.
1474408 1476711 She says it's<br />mortifying, but it helps.
1478079 1479847 She says that they<br />all go as a group,
1479947 1482717 and they all talk about<br />their feelings together.
1483851 1486554 Because she's not<br />the only problem.
1496731 1499100 - What is she doing?
1502370 1504105 -Dad?
1508943 1510077 Dad.
1513514 1515616 -What is this?<br />What are you doing?
1515716 1518319 -They had an end-of-season<br />sale at Home Depot.
1518419 1519854 I thought a garden<br />would be nice.
1519954 1521789 -Well, you can't plant<br />anything in there now.
1521889 1524025 It -- I-I-It'll<br />frost over in a month.
1524125 1526494 -So we'll have<br />a nice yard for a month.
1526594 1528629 -No, no, no, no, no, no,<br />no, we're not doing this.
1528729 1530898 -Dan.<br />-Nah, ya didn't ask.
1530998 1532500 -I didn't know I<br />needed your permission.
1532600 1534201 -Yeah.<br />-Dad, no, I think this is nice.
1534301 1535803 -No.<br />-Mom, this is cool.
1535903 1539573 You know, I -- I don't like to<br />look at it all the time.
1539673 1541675 Think if we plant some<br />wildflowers or something-
1541776 1543944 -Get the fuck outta there!<br />-Dan!
1547648 1549283 Oh, so you're just leaving?
1550751 1552219 Honey, it's okay.
1552319 1554121 -No, none of this is okay!
1554221 1556657 - Daisy.
1561729 1563497 -Put your<br />hand on your diaphragm
1563597 1565566 and feel yourself<br />expand with breath.
1570704 1573641 Dan, welcome.
1574675 1577278 Why didn't you lie down?<br />We're doing breathing.
1578212 1581215 -Breathing.<br />-Yeah.
1610177 1611879 And inhale.
1614281 1616650 And on the exhale, we're<br />gonna just let it all go
1616750 1618486 on one big, shared sigh.
1618587 1620488 Here we go.
1631098 1634536 All right, just<br />dance, just dance.
1634635 1636003 Don't care how you look.
1636103 1639106 Just look silly, look<br />sexy, look stupid.
1639206 1640674 Who cares?
1640774 1642577 Just use your body to<br />express how ya feel.
1644546 1645746 -Come on, Dan, more.
1645846 1648182 Let's -- More.
1656857 1658792 -Good, all right.
1698933 1701636 -Part of our job as actors<br />is emotional intelligence,
1701735 1705372 to be able to recognize<br />what others feel,
1705472 1706974 to have that affect us,
1707074 1709977 and to be able to express<br />our own emotions, okay?
1710077 1713515 So this exercise is called<br />provocative questions.
1713615 1714949 -Oh, I love this one.
1715049 1717451 -And I'm going to<br />need two volunteers.
1718452 1722189 Lucian and...<br />Dan.
1724626 1727261 Please stand here<br />and face your partner.
1731799 1736671 Okay, so your partner<br />is your lifeline.
1737338 1739974 They are your oxygen,<br />and no one else exists.
1740074 1742309 Don't look at me.<br />-Don't look at her.
1744378 1747047 -All right, so, Dan,<br />you're going to start
1747147 1749049 by asking Lucian a question
1749149 1751118 that you could never<br />ask him in real life,
1751218 1754989 something intentionally<br />provocative, okay?
1755089 1757758 And when you see<br />an emotional rise in him,
1757858 1761862 you articulate it by<br />telling him what you see.
1763632 1764932 -Like?
1765966 1769770 -Like, "You're<br />angry," if he's angry.
1770471 1771673 Clear?<br />-I can take it.
1771772 1773040 You can really hit me.
1773140 1774609 -I-I-I don't know.<br />-Don't look at me, okay?
1774709 1777211 -Don't look at her. Look at me.<br />-Okay.
1777311 1781315 So, many of us live our lives<br />repressing our emotions
1781415 1784184 because out there,<br />they can be a liability.
1784285 1786053 But in here, we are<br />in a safe space.
1786153 1789123 And we can put those<br />emotions into good use.
1789223 1790692 -So I ask...
1790791 1792493 -A provocative question.
1793961 1798399 -Um, you like Michael Jordan?
1800834 1803137 -What do I --<br />-His emotion.
1803237 1804706 -I don't know.<br />-Disappointed.
1804805 1806173 I was disappointed.<br />-Here, okay.
1806273 1807908 -I saw that.<br />-Okay, okay, um, ensemble,
1808008 1810477 was that a brave,<br />provocative question?
1810578 1813914 -No, no, no, no.<br />-Weak, weak.
1814014 1816050 -Okay, Lucian,<br />it's your turn.
1816150 1817418 -Yeah.
1819320 1821021 When you masturbate,<br />do you fantasize
1821121 1822590 about having your nipples<br />chewed until they bleed?
1822691 1823957 -What? No!<br />What --
1824058 1825292 -Don't answer.<br />-He's embarrassed.
1825392 1826795 -Don't answer.<br />-He's embarrassed.
1826894 1829063 -Dan, repeat,<br />"I'm embarrassed."
1829731 1831865 -I'm embarrassed.
1831965 1833233 -There you go.
1833334 1837271 - Hey, yeah.
1837371 1839973 -Now we're gonna<br />go a little deeper.
1840508 1845513 Lucian, I want you to ask Dan<br />something more vulnerable.
1845613 1846914 -Hmm.
1854421 1855989 Are you lonely?
1857592 1859059 You're surprised.
1860695 1862329 -Repeat.
1863631 1865700 -I'm surprised.
1865800 1867101 -See that?
1867201 1868570 See that? That's the truth.
1868670 1869738 -Yep.
1869838 1871939 - Yes.<br />- Whoo!
1872039 1873641 Give it up.
1889858 1891291 -Daisy.
1891392 1892960 -Go away.
1893060 1895663 -Wanna bust some balls?
1900835 1902269 -Oh, word.<br />-That's a homer.
1902369 1904873 -Yeah, that is. Where'd it go?
1908208 1910978 -That one's right<br />behind ya still.
1911078 1912847 -Ooh, a swing and a miss.
1912946 1914381 -All right, you don't --<br />-All right.
1914481 1916950 -Uh, just, uh, stand<br />your ground like this.
1920053 1923123 That's it. There ya go.
1927961 1929864 -What?
1929963 1932867 -You're happy.<br />-Okay, weirdo.
1932966 1935202 - Again?<br />- Yeah.
1935302 1937438 Let's go at the same time.<br />-All right.
1941041 1942510 -I should have said you<br />only have to dress up
1942610 1943912 for the actual deposition.
1944011 1944978 -Told you.<br />-It's okay.
1945078 1947682 -Uh, it's casual Friday.
1947782 1949818 My wife is obsessed
1949918 1954087 with this, um,<br />um, makeover show.
1954188 1958593 Okay, so, um, how this will work
1958693 1962564 is, uh, we'll go over what<br />to expect at the deposition,
1962664 1964732 um, procedures, et cetera.
1964833 1967234 And, uh, we'll also practice<br />me asking you questions
1967334 1969470 so you'll be more<br />comfortable on the day.
1969571 1970872 Uh, hopefully,<br />we'll only need, uh,
1970971 1972372 one or two of these meetings.
1972473 1974141 I know we wanna keep<br />billable hours low.
1974241 1976043 And I'm not a cheap date.
1977444 1980582 -Is she gonna be<br />there, Christine?
1980682 1981916 -Uh, we don't know.
1982015 1983283 Uh, Illinois code<br />of civil procedure
1983383 1985118 doesn't prohibit<br />her from attending.
1985219 1988355 Uh, if she does opt to<br />join, it's -- it's likely
1988455 1990525 that her parents<br />will be there, too.
1993460 1995062 Okey dokey then.
1999199 2001101 How has this time been for you?
2001836 2005038 -It's been...difficult.
2006240 2008008 More than difficult.
2010979 2015583 I know it's impossible, but<br />I just want my family back.
2019587 2021789 -That's all, Mrs. Mueller,<br />thank you.
2023958 2026360 And that's it.<br />Fantastic, really nice.
2026460 2028462 It was clear, uh, non-combative,
2028563 2031298 emotional undercurrent<br />but in a controlled way.
2032767 2034201 - I'm exhausted.
2034301 2035870 -Who wants to go next?
2035970 2038338 Daisy, all right.
2038438 2039774 -Okay.
2042309 2043711 -Uh, Daisy,<br />can you tell me,
2043811 2046681 when did you first meet<br />Christine Hawthorne?
2046781 2048115 -It was at Thanksgiving.
2048215 2049717 She had dinner with us.
2049817 2052052 -And what was her<br />relationship with your brother?
2052152 2054923 -They were coupled<br />in a romantic fashion.
2055023 2059259 -Simpler.<br />-Um, she was his girlfriend.
2059359 2061461 -Uh, um.
2062329 2063932 Yeah, uh, keep going.
2064032 2065967 I just have to pee.
2087622 2089389 -Rude as fuck!<br />-It doesn't matter.
2089489 2091025 If you become aggressive --<br />-No, what are you even on about?
2091124 2092359 That was so rude.<br />- Daisy.
2092459 2093962 -I'm not being aggressive<br />to you.
2094062 2095495 -Hey, what happened?
2095597 2097230 -He's making it seem like<br />it's all Brian's fault.
2097331 2099132 -That's what their<br />defense attorney's gonna do.
2099232 2100668 They're gonna try<br />to throw you off.
2100768 2102537 If you become combative --<br />-You're being combative.
2102637 2103938 -This is we're practicing.<br />-I'm not being defensive!
2104038 2105439 -Daisy.
2105540 2107107 -You need to get used<br />to keeping your cool.
2107207 2109043 -I can't be a robot<br />when I talk about this.
2109142 2111244 I don't know how you two can.
2120120 2122056 -Should we, uh,<br />pause for the day?
2122155 2124291 -We're paying for the hour.
2124391 2126360 We should use the time.
2126460 2127494 -Dan?
2137572 2139306 Okay, so --<br />-I-I-I think
2139406 2142510 we should stop for Daisy.
2146648 2149017 -If I profane with<br />my unworthiest hand
2149117 2152654 this holy shrine,<br />the gentle sin is this.
2152754 2155556 -And, Tyler,<br />reach out your hand to her.
2158660 2162362 -My lips, two<br />blushing pilgrims,
2162462 2166868 ready stand to smooth that<br />rough touch with a tender kiss.
2169369 2172707 Um, sorry, I -- I can smell<br />cigarettes on your breath.
2172807 2175375 I'm just -- I'm very allergic.<br />-To smells?
2175475 2178079 -Uh, just keep, Rita, please.
2184284 2188288 -Good pilgrim, you do<br />wrong your hand too much.
2188388 2190190 -Isn't the language gorgeous?
2190290 2192527 -Yeah, I just wish<br />I knew what it meant.
2192627 2193460 -Me, too.
2195462 2198066 -For saints have hands that<br />pilgrims' hands do touch,
2198166 2200868 and palm to palm is<br />holy palmers' kiss.
2200968 2205173 Saints do not move, though<br />grant for prayer's sake.
2205272 2208375 -Then move not, while<br />my prayers effect I take.
2208475 2210812 -And this is when you kiss.
2214849 2216818 -I'm sorry, are we gonna<br />have an intimacy coordinator?
2218318 2220387 We always had one at ISU.<br />-Intimacy what?
2220487 2222156 -It -- It, uh, it's -- it's<br />like a fight choreographer
2222255 2223558 but for physical intimacy.
2223658 2225059 -Never heard of it.<br />-Not surprising.
2225159 2226627 -I read about it<br />in "The Times."
2226728 2228629 -We don't need it. We can<br />figure it out ourselves.
2228730 2230765 -Well, it's -- it's<br />industry standard,
2230865 2232834 maybe not when you were<br />acting professionally.
2232934 2234569 -Are we gonna get a<br />fight choreographer?
2234669 2235703 -No.<br />-No.
2236637 2238371 The audience lives through us.
2238472 2240407 We owe them something real.
2241475 2243745 -I'm not doing that.
2243845 2245378 Also...
2246147 2248916 -Look, go ahead, Tyler.
2249449 2252220 Whatever you have to say,<br />this is a safe space.
2252319 2254321 -I think the age difference<br />is a problem here.
2254421 2256023 Does anybody else<br />think it's weird
2256124 2258258 that Juliet is my mom's age?
2258358 2260528 R and J are supposed<br />to be young.
2260628 2263030 That's the point.<br />-Tyler.
2263131 2264799 This is our cast.
2264899 2266734 This is who auditioned.
2266834 2271205 And Rita got the role because<br />she was excellent in her read.
2271304 2274307 She's a very skilled<br />and accomplished actor.
2274407 2276944 -Who is too old for the part.
2277879 2279312 I'm not being a dick.
2279412 2281883 Kids are, like, impulsive.
2281983 2286754 It's just not the same<br />story if Juliet's...
2286854 2288723 50.
2288823 2292425 I thought we were supposed<br />to be honest in here.
2305173 2306240 Ohh!<br />-Rita.
2306339 2309277 -Oh.<br />-Oh, my God! Ah!
2309376 2310611 -Damn it.<br />-Ah!
2310711 2313080 -Oh, Tyler,<br />Tyler, oh, shit.
2313181 2315116 I am so, so sorry.
2315216 2317985 This will not happen<br />again...probably.
2318085 2319352 -Drama.
2322190 2324625 -How's the hand?
2324725 2326627 -Do you know that,<br />when was young,
2326727 2329630 we had to make out in auditions?
2330631 2332332 You don't know how<br />many older actors stuck
2332432 2334769 their filthy tongues<br />down my throat.
2335770 2337905 And not even on<br />stage always either.
2344245 2346714 I'm old school.<br />-Me, too.
2347715 2348783 -And old.
2350218 2351519 -Me, too.
2354387 2357191 -I've wanted to play<br />Juliet my whole life,
2357291 2363496 but I was -- I was<br />never delicate enough,
2363598 2366601 never light enough.
2366701 2370671 -Well, it's all pretend anyway,<br />right?
2371371 2374976 Besides, you're good.
2378478 2379914 -Tyler.<br />-No.
2380982 2383084 I have an agent.
2387188 2390157 -Rita, may I speak with you?
2404939 2408009 -Hey, uh, let me<br />ask you something.
2408109 2412947 How'd you memorize all those<br />lines for the school plays?
2413047 2414782 And you never seem<br />stressed about it.
2414882 2416584 -Dad, asking an actor how<br />they memorized lines is,
2416684 2419287 like, the most basic question.
2419387 2420955 The lines are the easy part.
2421055 2423758 The hard part is<br />the emotional journey,
2423858 2426294 living truthfully in<br />imaginary circumstances,
2426394 2427862 blah, blah, blah.
2430463 2432700 It's easier if it has a rhythm.
2432800 2435036 Then, you can think<br />of 'em like a song.
2435836 2438639 -And Shakespeare has a rhythm?
2438739 2441441 -Ba, da, ba, da,<br />ba, da, ba, da.
2441542 2445513 "Two houses both alike<br />in dignity" -- easy.
2446380 2447882 -Huh.
2449482 2452186 Ba, da, ba, da, ba, da, ba, da.
2454255 2455690 Hey, Mike.<br />-What's up?
2455790 2457992 -Not that she would,<br />but if Sharon asks,
2458092 2461896 can you say we, uh, grabbed<br />a beer tonight together?
2461996 2465800 Uh, the -- the lawyer wants<br />to go over my testimony,
2465900 2468135 and, uh, I don't wanna tell her
2468235 2472340 'cause it's more billable hours.
2472440 2474275 -Oh, where is Romeo?
2474375 2476610 Saw you him today?
2476711 2479814 Right glad I am he<br />was not at this fray.
2479914 2483084 -Madam, an hour<br />before the worshiped sun --
2483184 2484518 -Oh, wait, hold.
2484618 2486486 Oh, this isn't gonna work.
2486587 2488990 Lucian, you can't be<br />Romeo and Benvolio.
2489090 2490691 You can't do scenes<br />with your son.
2490791 2492426 -No, no, I have<br />a plan for that.
2492526 2494895 Just...<br />Good morrow, cousin.
2495763 2497264 Is the day so young?<br />-No.
2497365 2498699 -Can I have a hat, too?
2502803 2505373 -Silence in the house.<br />-Line.
2505473 2508309 Damn, I was in flow.<br />-Just stay in it.
2508409 2509810 -Line.
2509910 2512613 -Was that my father<br />that went hence so fast?
2517118 2520221 -Was that my father<br />that went hence so fast?
2521255 2524525 - Lady, lady,
2524625 2527294 oh, alas, alas.
2527395 2529797 Help, help, my lady's dead.
2529897 2532433 O, lamentable day.<br />-What is the matter?
2532533 2535569 -O, tired day.
2535669 2539473 -O, me, o, me, my child,
2539573 2544178 my only child, revive, look up,
2544278 2546814 or I will die with thee.
2546914 2548249 -Okay.
2550785 2553254 Dan, that's you.<br />-Sorry.
2556290 2557691 -Ha, let me see her out.
2557792 2559927 Alas, she's cold.
2560027 2562830 Her blood is settled,<br />and her joints are stiff.
2562930 2565933 Life and these lips<br />have long been separate--
2568569 2570539 -...ted<br />-...ted, ted.
2572039 2574008 Death lies on her<br />like an untimely frost
2574108 2575743 upon the sweetest flower...<br />-Oh.
2575843 2577678 -...in all the fields.<br />-Oh, lamentable day.
2577778 2579447 -Oh, woeful time.
2579548 2581115 -Greg, stop cutting me off.
2581215 2585219 -Death, that hath ta'en<br />her hence to make me well,
2585319 2587988 ties up my tongue and<br />will not let me speak.
2589757 2591225 -Okay, let's hold there.
2592026 2594195 You've really found the rhythm.
2594895 2597998 -Well, it -- it -- it helps if<br />you learn it like a song.
2598099 2602303 -Okay, but now let's<br />make it real, okay?
2602403 2604004 Come here.
2606640 2608577 Do you have kids?
2608676 2610144 How many?
2610244 2612046 -Two.<br />-Perfect.
2613247 2616750 I want you to imagine --<br />close your eyes...
2618285 2621889 ...finding your child dead.
2623124 2626861 You see their body,<br />and it's them but not.
2626961 2629864 You touch their<br />skin, and it's cold.
2629964 2633334 You try to shake them awake,<br />and their limbs are stiff.
2634368 2636538 It's -- It's like a nightmare.
2636637 2639574 You wanna wake up,<br />but you can't.
2639673 2641942 Can you imagine that?
2645646 2647214 Fantastic, great.
2647314 2649984 All right, we'll hit this<br />again tomorrow, all right?
2650084 2652753 Okay, everybody, I wanna, uh,<br />go back to the Paris scene.
2652853 2654155 I wanna cut it.
2654255 2655689 -No.<br />-Lucian, Lucian,
2655789 2657024 if you're so invested<br />in Paris, you know what?
2657124 2658759 You can do it in<br />the wings during --
2658859 2660194 -You're really gonna cut Paris<br />from the show?
2660294 2661929 -Yes, I'm going, I'm going --<br />-No, like --
2662029 2663565 -Nobody cares about it.<br />-I -- I care about Paris.
2663664 2665432 -Just let it go.
2668235 2670337 -Honey?
2711580 2714281 -Come on in, Daisy.
2717851 2720721 Dan, why don't you join us, too?
2723525 2727662 Daisy asked if we could meet<br />together, the three of us.
2727761 2729463 I thought that was a great idea.
2729564 2731165 Is that okay with you, Dan?
2734401 2737805 So, last week, we spent most
2737905 2740174 of our session<br />talking about Brian.
2741342 2744613 -It's a terrible thing
2744713 2747147 for a family to<br />have to experience.
2747248 2749783 -My dad won't talk about it.<br />-That's not true.
2750619 2752453 Uh, it's not good to dwell.
2752554 2755089 -That's what Daisy<br />said at first.
2755189 2758425 But recently, she's<br />begun sharing about him,
2758526 2763665 not just his death but<br />who he was in his life.
2763764 2765799 It's painful. I know.
2765899 2767868 Ultimately --<br />-It helps, Dad.
2767968 2769970 We're all just pretending<br />like he never existed.
2770070 2771805 -No, we talk about<br />him all the time.
2771905 2773608 It's -- It's costing me<br />a fortune
2773708 2774975 to talk about it so much.<br />-Oh, my God.
2775075 2776810 That's not the same.
2776910 2780180 -Daisy, why don't you<br />tell your dad how you feel
2780281 2784084 using the language<br />we've been working on?
2788222 2789758 -I just...
2790991 2794461 I feel like I'm not<br />allowed to be sad.
2795697 2798232 And I'm sad all the time.
2798332 2803837 But if me or mom talk<br />about him...
2804872 2808576 ...I'm worried you'll<br />blow up or leave.
2812913 2817051 I miss him so much.
2818319 2821021 And I don't know if you<br />feel guilty or angry.
2821121 2823090 I -- I don't know how you feel.
2823190 2825527 -All right, all right,<br />I-I gotta go to work.
2825627 2827562 I can't just...
2827662 2829129 Do your job.
2829229 2830331 Help her.
2834868 2836837 -Fucking knew it.
2842376 2843877 -Hey.<br />-What up?
2843977 2845979 -Uh, Patrick needs to see you.
2850150 2853020 <i>-The fuck</i><br /><i>outta the road.</i>
2853120 2855022 -Yeah.<br /><i>-Stop, stop, stop.</i>
2855122 2856524 -That's you, right?
2856624 2859093 <i>-Stop.</i><br />-Look, Dan.
2859193 2860994 I know you've been<br />going through a lot.
2861095 2863864 -No. There are no excuses.<br />-But we cannot afford a lawsuit.
2863964 2865633 -Hey, I didn't narc.
2865734 2868068 Some -- Some teenager posted it<br />trying to go viral, you know.
2868168 2870538 This generation, man.<br />-No. It's my -- It's my fault.
2870638 2872707 I should have reported<br />it to you immediately.
2872807 2875209 -It shouldn't have<br />happened, full stop.
2875309 2877344 I've also heard, not from Mikey,
2877444 2880447 that you've been<br />leaving early some days?
2881482 2883984 -Well, the -- the<br />deposition's coming up.
2884084 2885553 -What deposition?
2886821 2888455 -It's -- It's for his kid.
2888556 2891024 They're, uh, suing the -- the<br />parents and the -- the girl.
2893661 2896397 -You should take some leave.<br />-I can't afford it.
2896497 2899667 -We can't afford to have<br />you, you're a liability.
2899768 2902504 -I-I'm -- I'm fine.
2902604 2904972 See?
2905072 2908843 -Oh, my love, my wife,
2908942 2911145 death that had taken the --
2911245 2914982 death that had taken<br />thy honey of thy breath
2915082 2918853 hath had no power<br />yet upon thy beauty.
2918952 2921689 Here, here I will remain...
2921790 2923223 -You all right, dear heart?
2923323 2926293 -...with worms that are thy --<br />Don't tell me.
2927127 2929963 -Chambermaids.<br />-Chambermaids.
2930799 2934301 Eyes, look your last.
2934869 2938238 Arms, take your last<br />embrace, and lips,
2938338 2943711 oh, you the doors of breath,<br />seal with a righteous kiss.
2951985 2953621 Here's to my love.
2965132 2968101 Aah!
2968202 2970505 -Oh, that's -- that's great.<br />That's good.
2970605 2972574 Okay.
2980080 2983016 What's here?
2983551 2986754 A cup closed in my<br />true love's hand?
2987321 2991793 Poison, I see, hath<br />been his timeless end.
2991893 2994194 I will kiss thy lips.
2994294 2997331 Hap'ly some poison<br />doth hang in them.
3000802 3002704 Thy lips are warm.
3002804 3006073 -You're shaking.<br />-I will be brief.
3006173 3009611 Oh, happy dagger,<br />this is thy sheath.
3011144 3014916 There rust, and let me die.
3019219 3022122 -And they're dead,<br />thank Christ.
3022222 3025158 Okay, good job,<br />everybody, that was great.
3025259 3026628 Really good.
3026728 3030163 So, Lucian, Rita, great,<br />you can take a break.
3030264 3032867 We're gonna set up for<br />the parental forgiveness scene.
3032967 3035670 So, oh, I need my<br />Capulets, right?
3035770 3039908 So, Greg, Dan, uh, Lady Monta--<br />No, wait, you're dead.
3040008 3041341 -Oh, good.<br />-Yes.
3041441 3043143 Uh, but we didn't assign anybody
3043243 3044746 the first watch line.<br />-No, no, that was Lucian.
3044846 3046246 -Oh, really? Let's cut it.
3046346 3047849 -Where do you want me?<br />Am I here? Am I --
3047949 3049383 -Uh, up a little bit.<br />Up a little bit.
3049483 3051418 -Can we, uh, wait? Can we --<br />-Yeah, what is it, Dan?
3051519 3054522 -Uh, we can't end it that way.
3054622 3056223 -Oh, that's not<br />really the end, though,
3056323 3058392 because we have the --<br />-They should wake up.
3061729 3063765 -Yeah.
3063865 3064999 Oh.
3065098 3068603 Well, they can't wake up.
3068703 3070170 -Didn't you see me die?
3070270 3072139 I got poisoned.<br />She stabbed herself.
3072239 3073440 -Well, it's ridiculous.
3073541 3075142 They've only known<br />each other a week.
3075242 3077177 -That's the story. It's classic.<br />-It's stupid.
3077277 3078913 -It's romantic.<br />-It's tragic.
3079013 3080314 -But they're young.<br />-Supposed to be.
3080414 3082550 -And in love.<br />-Let's change it, okay?
3082650 3085118 I mean, we can do that, right,<br />since it's all made up.
3085218 3087120 It's make believe.<br />We can do whatever we want.
3087220 3089122 -We're not changing the ending<br />to "Romeo and Juliet."
3089222 3090825 -Why not?<br />-It's Shakespeare.
3090925 3093226 -Who gives a fuck?!
3112112 3115617 My...s-son...
3118586 3120588 ...Brian...
3126360 3128462 died last year.
3128563 3130330 He was 17.
3133768 3135770 He did it himself.
3140908 3143143 I should, uh...
3151151 3152820 I just...
3154656 3157692 liked that y'all didn't<br />look at me weird.
3201636 3202970 -Is that Dad?
3235268 3237672 -All right, uh --<br />-Bad news.
3237772 3239741 -Lucian.
3239841 3243077 -And he -- he's making<br />presence felt in a way,
3243177 3244478 in a powerful way.
3244579 3248182 Right, yes, exactly.
3248281 3252319 -Oh, I can do that.<br />-Congratulations.
3253221 3254622 -Thank you.
3254722 3256256 Okay, um,<br />all right, everybody,
3256356 3258025 can we, uh, take our seats?
3258126 3259560 Quick announcement.
3261294 3264031 So we are making<br />a casting change.
3264132 3265499 -Another one?<br />-Iago.
3265600 3268301 Lucian has suggested --
3268401 3270538 -The hat thing does not work.
3270638 3272940 He's going to be<br />stepping down as Romeo
3273040 3275643 with Dan stepping in.<br />-What?
3275743 3276778 -Yeah.<br />-Yes.
3276878 3278079 -If we were recasting,
3278179 3279914 I would like to have<br />been considered.
3280014 3282683 -Me, too.<br />-Lady MacB.
3282784 3284819 - No, I'm<br />not right for this.
3284919 3286687 I'm too old.<br />-So am I.
3286788 3288689 -Oh, I think<br />you'd be wonderful.
3288790 3291893 -I'm sorry, Dan.<br />Rita said you wanted this.
3291993 3293761 -Yeah.
3315883 3318351 -There. Now this...
3318451 3321222 this makes sense.
3336270 3338172 -See you later.<br />-Wh-Where are you going?
3338272 3340775 -Uh, I'm meeting<br />Mikey for a beer.
3340875 3342243 -Again?
3342342 3345179 -Well, uh, he's having<br />relationship problems.
3346614 3348415 -Can I get a ride?
3348516 3350518 Wesley Crane said that he<br />would help me study for trig
3350618 3352987 if I met him in town.
3354222 3355790 -But you're grounded.
3358559 3361529 -I think if it's for<br />school, she can go.
3375509 3376744 -Where are you meeting him?
3376844 3379446 -Buzzed. Where are<br />you meeting Mikey?
3379547 3382817 -Farragut's.<br />Call me when you're done.
3382917 3384018 -Mm-hmm.
3430264 3431365 -Where is everyone?
3437872 3441342 -Could you, um, both<br />come have a seat here
3441441 3444712 on the white blanket, please?
3444812 3447381 Okay.
3447480 3451652 Dan, you can sit here.<br />Rita, over here.
3451752 3454188 Uh, shoes off, please.
3460328 3464265 I think that Tyler had a point
3464365 3467301 about an intimacy coordinator.
3467401 3469270 Obviously, we can't afford one,
3469370 3471872 but I have done some research.
3473774 3476877 I really do want this<br />to be a safe space.
3477778 3482149 Okay, um, first step is
3482249 3487355 to just get comfortable<br />looking at each other, okay?
3487455 3490825 So if you could both<br />sit facing each other.
3497365 3498632 Okay.
3499834 3503704 And make eye contact<br />with each other, please.
3506140 3509243 And keep -- keep -- keep looking<br />into each other's eyes.
3517651 3520254 Okay, that's step one.
3528162 3530798 Okay, now we're gonna get<br />comfortable with touch.
3530898 3535336 So, Rita, you're going<br />to ask Dan if it's okay
3535436 3537705 to put your hand<br />on his shoulder.
3539740 3542276 -Can I put my hand<br />on your shoulder?
3550519 3552586 -Dan, is that comfortable?
3554855 3557124 See if you can relax a little.
3563064 3567134 Okay, now, Dan, you<br />do the same to Rita.
3567234 3570271 -Mm.
3570371 3572073 That okay?
3581449 3583150 -That's good, okay, good.
3583250 3587288 Uh, so now, if you wanna scooch<br />a little closer to each other
3587388 3590958 and -- and lean in so just<br />your foreheads are touching.
3593661 3596497 -Mm, c-can -- can I ask,<br />what's the point of this?
3596597 3598799 -We're trying to build trust,
3598899 3600701 little by little, step by step,
3600801 3603170 the three of us first<br />and then the two of you
3603270 3606941 because you're the ones who<br />are actually gonna be doing it.
3607041 3608175 -Doing what?
3608275 3609910 -Kissing.<br />-Falling in love.
3611546 3613080 -I'm married.
3613180 3615349 -Well, good for you.
3615449 3616951 It's not real.
3624458 3626127 -Okay, lean in.
3628262 3633200 Okay, and just feel<br />each other breathing.
3667835 3670237 Okay, now, Dan, open your eyes.
3671939 3674141 And you're going to kiss her.
3675676 3678679 -Um, where?
3678779 3680714 -On the lips.
3688889 3691358 -Hey, asshole!<br />-Hey, Daisy.
3691458 3692826 -Yes.<br />-Say hi to mom, cheater.
3692927 3694828 -Nothing is happening!<br />-And who do we have...
3694929 3696030 -Hey.<br />-...here?
3696130 3697464 -Hey, hey, hey.<br />-Get ready
3697566 3699333 to go viral, bitch.<br />-Hey.
3699433 3700602 -Is this your daughter?
3700701 3702604 She's lovely.
3702703 3705005 -You knew he had kids?
3706575 3708175 How could you do this?
3708275 3710311 -Excuse me.
3714748 3718587 -Oh, God, is this a threesome?
3718687 3720487 -I-It's fake.
3720589 3722723 It's for a play.
3728530 3730097 -What play?
3731498 3733568 Whoo.
3744713 3746480 -Let's go.
3746581 3748082 -How long did you<br />live in New York?
3748182 3749984 16 years.
3750084 3752753 - That's as long as I've<br />been alive.
3752853 3754556 I'm gonna move there<br />when I turn 18.
3754656 3756524 -Uh, maybe.<br />-We visited New York
3756625 3759059 when I was a freshman.<br />I loved it.
3759159 3761395 We saw "Phantom of the Opera."
3761495 3763163 -Ticket's cost 180 bucks each.
3763264 3764898 -I had a roommate<br />who was in "Phantom."
3764999 3766400 -In the cast?<br />-Mm-hmm.
3766500 3767968 -How much do you make<br />on a job like that?
3768068 3769571 -Dad, it's not about the money.
3769671 3770938 -Broadway minimum<br />is two grand a week.
3771038 3772741 -Fuck, yeah.<br />-Hey.
3772840 3774676 -But two grand<br />is nothing there.
3774775 3777278 That city just takes and takes
3777378 3780281 until you're a husk<br />with 80 grand of debt
3780381 3782016 and two monologues.
3787354 3788989 -Hey, you know what<br />I like about you?
3789089 3791325 -What?<br />-You've got character.
3791425 3792694 -Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
3792793 3794428 And personality.<br />-Right?
3794529 3796096 -And you know, that's good
3796196 3799567 because the ingenue phase<br />lasts about three seconds.
3799668 3801902 -I love playing the weirdos.<br />-Yeah.
3802002 3803904 -I auditioned for<br />"Oklahoma" last year.
3804004 3805507 And, well, first, I was bummed
3805607 3809176 because the role of Laurey<br />went to Chelsea Nussbaum.
3809276 3811278 She was a senior.
3811378 3812946 -Oh, you have to get<br />used to the politics.
3813047 3814348 It's all political.
3814448 3817051 -Yeah, but then I<br />loved playing Ado Annie.
3817151 3819386 -Because she's the more<br />interesting character.
3819486 3822890 -Yeah, she -- she was great.<br />-He has to say that.
3822990 3824458 -Are you great?
3827995 3829597 -I believe you.
3829698 3831566 So what's the next musical?
3833100 3838439 -Oh, um, I'm retired.
3839239 3841108 -You making her quit?<br />-No.
3841208 3843944 No, watching her on stage<br />is my favorite thing.
3846447 3850518 -Okay, I'm gonna re-up,<br />um, beers all around?
3850618 3852419 -Yes, please.<br />-Sprite for her.
3852520 3854188 Water for me.
3856791 3859059 -I bet she's a good actor.
3859159 3861195 She's real intense.
3861295 3865899 -All right, everybody,<br />next up we have Daisy.
3865999 3867368 So, Daisy, come on up
3867468 3869136 to the stage.<br />-Did you put a song on?
3869236 3870938 - No.
3871038 3873608 -Do we have<br />a Daisy in the house?
3873708 3874942 -Look, I swear it wasn't me.
3875042 3876578 -Uh, I think there's a mistake.
3876678 3879079 The next person can just go.
3879179 3881549 -Come on, Daisy.<br />Come on up here.
3881649 3882717 Come on, come on.
3884385 3886855 Come on, everybody.<br />Let's call Daisy up here.
3886954 3888956 Come on, no one wants<br />to hear me sing.
3889056 3891392 -That's true.<br />-Thanks, Greg.
3892761 3895329 Hit it.
3906006 3907776 We can go home.
3907876 3909109 Wanna go home?
3924224 3926026 Uh-huh.
3926126 3927928 Come, Daisy. Whoo!
3978278 3979714 -Whoo, whoo.<br />-Awesome.
3979814 3981549 -Whoo.<br />-Yeah.
3985687 3987354 -What's an ingenue?
3987454 3990057 -She doesn't have<br />to worry about that.
3992594 3995663 -Oh, yes, bye, yes.<br />-We got a star.
3995763 3997331 -Thank you.<br />-Bye, Moira.
3997431 3999099 Greg, we have to<br />duet or something.
3999199 4000535 Bye, Lucian.<br />-Come on, let's go.
4000635 4002169 -See you later, Jonah.<br />-Nice to meet you.
4002269 4003437 - Bye.<br />- Come on, let's go.
4003538 4005172 Does anybody want a ride?<br />-Daisy.
4005272 4007307 Daisy, you were<br />excellent tonight.
4007407 4008776 -Oh, stop.
4008877 4010010 Just kidding, keep going.
4010110 4011679 -I'm wondering, uh,
4011779 4015215 any chance you might<br />consider joining the play?
4017017 4018753 -Like?
4018853 4020153 -She's in school.
4020254 4023090 -Yeah, right.<br />-Well, I'm suspended.
4025325 4029162 -Think about it,<br />any part you want.
4036136 4038105 -Your friends are<br />surprisingly fun.
4038205 4040008 -Well, they're not<br />really my friends.
4040107 4041743 They're more like coworkers.
4041843 4044579 -I think you have to be<br />being paid for it to be a job.
4044679 4048683 I can't believe Lanora<br />wants me to be in the show.
4048783 4050618 -Well, she needs talent.
4050718 4053521 With you, there'd be two<br />talented people in the cast.
4053621 4054722 -You and me?
4054822 4057090 - You and Rita.
4061395 4063798 -You remember when<br />I played Rizzo,
4063898 4065867 and Marcus Waldrop<br />played Kenickie,
4065967 4069069 and we had to spend that whole<br />scene making out upstage?
4069169 4070638 -Yeah, I still don't know<br />why that was necessary...
4070738 4072406 -It was weird because...<br />-...for a high school play.
4072507 4075375 -...I never saw Marcus<br />like that.
4075475 4078345 But then, in the show,<br />I started liking him,
4078445 4081883 and I would get all<br />cute for rehearsal,
4081983 4083651 and my hands would be sweaty.
4083751 4087120 And when we kissed, we would<br />pass candy back and forth.
4088523 4091025 -We tried to date after closing.
4091124 4094028 Didn't work, classic showmance.
4094127 4097230 Rizzo loved Kenickie,<br />but turns out
4097331 4099534 Daisy thinks Marcus<br />is a real tool.
4102135 4104639 It's supposed to be fake,
4104739 4108676 but the feelings can<br />feel real sometimes.
4108776 4110277 And that's -- that's fine.
4110377 4112312 It's even fun sometimes.
4115115 4117585 As long as you don't act on it.
4129097 4131131 Dad.
4132432 4134002 I think it's really great
4134102 4136169 that you found<br />a place where you feel.
4137639 4140140 I just don't wanna<br />screw that up for you.
4145780 4148148 - Well...
4148716 4156658 ...let's not tell your mom just<br />yet about <i>our</i> play.
4159127 4160394 -I'm gonna be so good.
4160494 4162096 It's gonna be legendary.
4162195 4164532 - I already know what<br />part I want.
4168670 4169771 Uh-oh.
4171271 4172907 -Daisy, go to your room.<br />-What's wrong?
4173007 4175308 -Go!
4175409 4177745 -What happened?
4179914 4181582 -You motherfucker!<br />-Hey.
4181683 4184052 -Do you know who came<br />to see me tonight?
4184152 4185452 Fucking Mikey.
4185553 4187220 -Shit.<br />-I was mortified.
4187320 4188690 Let me explain.
4188790 4191125 -You're on mandatory leave?<br />Who is she?
4191224 4192894 -Who?<br />-Whoever it is
4192994 4194128 you've been sneaking<br />around with.
4194227 4195630 -I'm -- There's nobody.
4195730 4200735 -Oh, my -- Oh, my God,<br />Daisy and I saw you.
4200835 4204839 You know, people told me<br />that this would happen,
4204939 4206607 that -- that couples<br />who have been through
4206708 4208176 what we have...<br />-Listen, sweetheart.
4208275 4210011 -...they don't make it.<br />It's too hard.
4210111 4211846 -I'm in a play!
4214615 4216283 -What?
4219187 4221488 -I'm in a play.
4221589 4225560 I've been going to<br />play practice, uh...
4226594 4230164 ...for this community<br />theater production
4230263 4235469 of...<br />"Romeo and Juliet."
4237905 4240141 -No, ya haven't.
4240240 4242076 -It's true, Mom.
4242176 4244311 I thought he was messing<br />around on us, too.
4244411 4247048 But then I followed him,<br />and...
4247148 4249416 he's playing Romeo.
4256256 4257992 -You're too old.
4262295 4264264 Why didn't you tell me?
4265099 4267300 -'Cause it's embarrassing.
4269737 4271973 -You should have told me.<br />-I know.
4276376 4278546 Takes my mind off things.
4285586 4287855 -Say some of your lines for me.
4287955 4290057 -No.<br />-Come on.
4290158 4291692 I won't judge.
4293961 4296363 -Well, you can't look<br />at me when I say them.
4296463 4299200 I mean it.
4299299 4301301 Close your eyes.
4302402 4303938 Close them.
4311112 4315716 What lady is that
4315817 4319654 which doth enrich<br />the hand of yonder knight?
4320922 4324025 Oh, she doth teach<br />the torches to burn bright.
4325259 4327028 Did my heart love till now?
4328461 4330031 Forswear it, sight.
4331799 4335036 For I never saw true<br />beauty till this night.
4342510 4346113 I'm not gonna say it like that.
4366634 4368435 -Best agrees with knight.

4500568 4502269 -Oh, it's not that bad.<br />-Stop, stop, stop.
4502370 4505006 -All right, all right.

4536137 4537471 -Whoo.

4540641 4544011 -Oh, it's gorgeous.<br />This is just gorgeous.
4544111 4546414 -How much?
4546515 4548082 -Free.<br />-Whoo.
4548182 4550284 -She said it's free.<br />-When will you need it?
4550384 4554355 -Uh, um, dress rehearsal's<br />Thursday, curtain up Friday.
4554455 4557658 -Next Friday?<br />-One night only.
4557758 4560529 -Big day.<br />-This is unbelievable.
4560628 4562196 -This'll work.
4571672 4572973 -No, don't bite him.
4573074 4574543 -I didn't bite him.<br />I was kissing him.
4574642 4576143 -You get a prize.<br />What do you want?
4576243 4577845 -Oh, oh, I want the panda.<br />How many for the panda?

4607241 4609877 -Hun, what's wrong?<br />-What's the matter?
4612213 4613681 -Daisy, wait.
4615916 4620154 Daisy, honey, honey.
4623023 4626026 Sweetheart.<br />-Where are my keys?
4626127 4629330 I -- I-I'll be right there.<br />I'm coming.
4636370 4637972 -Mr. Mueller.
4639173 4641909 Sorry, the guy back there<br />was looking for you.
4646548 4649416 How are you? How's Daisy?
4651085 4653988 - You know, not good.
4654822 4657024 Where are your parents?
4657124 4659594 I told them<br />I had to use the bathroom.
4659727 4661095 -I gotta go.<br />-Can I --
4662396 4664698 Um...
4664798 4667701 I don't<br />really know what to say.
4669270 4671205 -We're not supposed<br />to be talking at all.
4671305 4673140 -I know.
4676143 4678112 I'm so sorry.
4680681 4682016 And I know that's, like,
4682116 4684385 the stupidest<br />possible thing to say.
4686287 4689190 Uh, did you, uh, did<br />you all get my letters?
4690424 4692226 -You can't contact us.
4694428 4696163 -I know you hate me.
4697865 4700100 I hate me, too.
4700201 4702236 I'm gonna hate myself<br />for the rest of my life.
4702336 4705239 -Christine.<br />-I-I didn't mean to wake up.
4711513 4716183 Um, do you think -- Could I<br />apologize to Mrs. Mueller?
4717619 4720120 -No, that<br />wouldn't be a good idea.
4720655 4724992 -Um, uh, could you maybe just<br />give this to Daisy from me?
4732199 4733467 Thanks.
4761630 4763797 -Okay.
4767101 4768902 - You got it?<br />- Yeah, I got it.
4769003 4770672 -Beauty.<br />-I got it.
4770771 4773407 -You gotta go all the way down.<br />-All the way down? All right.
4776076 4778680 -Yeah, that's -- that moves<br />a little quicker from there.
4778779 4780582 -Mm, maybe like that.
4780682 4782617 -There's a section.
4786086 4789790 - One, two, three.
4789890 4793460 -Ah.<br />-Flapping our arms.
4793561 4796297 When we flap our arms, we're<br />opening up our up lungs.
4796397 4797565 Gonna open up our lungs.
4797666 4800568 -One, two.<br />-Uh, red ball.
4800669 4802870 Red ball to you.
4802970 4804938 -Cool, yeah.<br />-Red ball.
4805039 4806708 -Oh.<br />-Thank you.
4808643 4811546 Red ball.
4811646 4812980 -Yeah.<br />-Oh, yeah.
4813080 4815316 -That's good.<br />-Oh, yeah.
4815416 4817017 -Yeah, better.
4820888 4825392 -Oh, she's cold.
4827027 4829029 Her -- Her blood is settled,
4829129 4833967 and her joints are stiff.
4836337 4840207 Life and these lips have<br />long been separated.
4843043 4847716 Death has lain upon her<br />like an untimely frost
4847816 4853487 upon the sweetest<br />flower of the field.
4853588 4857391 O, child. O, child.
4858760 4861462 My soul and not my child.
4862963 4865633 Dead thou art, alack.
4865734 4868102 My child is dead.
4872906 4874408 -You got this?<br />-Yeah.
4874509 4878879 -And with my child,<br />my joys are buried.
4902236 4907441 -Uh, oh, my -- my love, my wife.
4907542 4909042 -Louder.
4909143 4911445 -Uh, sorry, sorry.
4911546 4914582 -There's no calling for lines.<br />Just make something up.
4916551 4918385 -Uh...<br />-Are you okay?
4918485 4920722 -Sorry, sorry.
4920822 4922256 -Are you<br />having a panic attack?
4922356 4923957 Someone get him<br />some ice to hold.
4924057 4927695 -Uh, I, uh, I don't --<br />I don't understand.
4927796 4931465 -What the -- the language or --<br />-Remember your folio clues.
4931566 4934101 -Locking up.<br />-Just five minutes, please.
4934201 4935737 -You gonna pay for it?
4935837 4938005 -We'll talk about it after<br />the run. Finish the scene.
4938105 4940407 You're almost dead.<br />You are so close.
4941576 4943143 -Lanora, we need to hold.
4943243 4945613 -Look, I'm not kidding ya.<br />I'll lock you all in here.
4945713 4947582 -What the hell?<br />-Okay, okay.
4956724 4960394 -We have five minutes.<br />I gave him $10, so, Dad --
4960494 4962362 -Hey, look, Daisy, this<br />doesn't concern you.
4962463 4965132 -Fuck it doesn't.<br />-Hey, I don't wanna talk.
4965232 4968570 -No shit. When things get hard,<br />you either blow up or bail.
4968670 4970270 It's a bad habit.
4970370 4972105 -Daisy.
4980080 4982449 It makes sense how painful<br />this is for you, Dan,
4982550 4986286 and, Daisy, I'm guessing it's<br />not easy for you either.
4988923 4991926 -You told them?
4992025 4994194 -I would never do<br />something like this.
4994294 4996831 -That's the problem -- you're<br />still thinking as yourself.
4996931 4998198 -Well, who am I<br />supposed to think as?
4998298 5000067 -Him.
5001903 5005272 -I-It won't work<br />if you're judging him.
5005372 5008375 You can't worry<br />about the ending yet.
5008475 5011144 Don't anticipate.<br />Just focus on the love.
5013581 5015617 -It's dangerous<br />to romanticize --
5015717 5017819 -I'm not.
5017919 5019453 -I can't condone what they did.
5019554 5021455 -You're not saying that<br />what they're doing is right.
5021556 5025459 -Can't you just think about<br />how he felt for five minutes?
5025560 5029062 He -- He felt trapped<br />a-and alone.
5029162 5030865 -How do you know that?
5030965 5033635 -I think about<br />him all the time.
5037705 5043210 Dad, you get to be him<br />for a couple of hours.
5045980 5050117 -Okay, start by thinking...
5051418 5055557 "I would never kill<br />myself unless"...
5057625 5059459 And then you imagine.
5060762 5064666 -But by doing this,<br />he doesn't get her back.
5064766 5066701 -I.
5071071 5073541 -I don't get her back.
5078046 5080380 -Time's up.
5082115 5084217 -Come on, let's go.<br />-Okay, okay.
5084318 5085954 -We're gonna be late.<br />We're always late.
5086054 5088790 We're always late.<br />-Okay.
5088890 5091325 -Come on, guys.<br />-Okay, okay.
5091425 5093995 Are you gonna shave?<br />-Shit, all right.
5094127 5095329 Might as well shave now.
5095429 5097097 -No, we -- Look, we<br />don't have time.
5097197 5099867 We just don't have time.<br />-What'd you bring it up for?
5105940 5107976 -What?
5108076 5110344 -You got something<br />on your face.
5121956 5123691 -Showtime.
5139907 5142175 -Wait, oh, here they are.
5167167 5169537 -Uh, Mr. Mueller, um, my<br />name is Joan Spencer,
5169637 5171405 and I'm representing<br />the Hawthornes
5171506 5173574 in the wrongful<br />death suit that you
5173675 5176744 and Mrs. Mueller have<br />filed against them.
5176844 5180114 I'm just gonna ask you<br />a series of questions today
5180213 5182282 regarding your son,<br />Brian Mueller,
5182382 5186521 and his death on May<br />25th of last year.
5187655 5191159 So could you start<br />by describing Brian
5191258 5193928 to us before he<br />met Miss Hawthorne?
5195096 5196463 -What -- Wh-What do you mean?
5196564 5198198 -You know,<br />like, what was he like?
5198298 5199967 Was he, uh, outgoing,<br />introverted,
5200068 5202170 um, popular, cerebral?
5203370 5206974 He was smart, shy,
5207075 5210511 sweet.
5210611 5213514 -Could he have been<br />described as sensitive?
5214916 5216349 -Sensitive like?
5216450 5219620 -Like, would things<br />get to him easily?
5219721 5223256 -Well, he had big feelings.<br />-How so?
5225358 5230565 -Uh, I'm -- I-I-I'm old school.
5230665 5234102 I -- I'm -- I'm not --<br />I don't get the therapy,
5234202 5237038 and the -- the talking<br />and the...
5237138 5238973 -Oh, uh,<br />verbally please.
5240474 5241943 -I don't -- I don't<br />know what normal is.
5242043 5246379 I, uh -- You know, both<br />my kids are dramatic.
5246480 5249316 They don't get it from me.
5249416 5251485 -Would you<br />say he was depressed?
5252954 5254756 - Not as --
5254856 5259227 Not always.<br />-Oh, not that you noticed?
5259326 5261428 -Only at the end of his life.
5263363 5266834 -Um, could you<br />tell us about Brian
5266934 5269503 once he met Miss Hawthorne?
5273808 5278345 -He was pretty obsessed.<br />-Like, in an unhealthy way?
5278445 5281414 -Again, I -- I don't know<br />what...
5281949 5284351 I proposed to Sharon<br />after our first date,
5284451 5287420 and, uh, that's crazy to me now.
5288890 5290390 He seemed happy.
5290490 5293360 -Okay, and when<br />did that change?
5296764 5300467 Uh, Christine's family<br />was moving to Arizona,
5300568 5304972 and, uh, Christine didn't<br />wanna go because of Brian,
5305072 5307642 but she didn't have a choice.
5307742 5310278 Brian told us he<br />wanted to go with her
5310377 5313346 and, uh, finish high<br />school out there with her.
5314381 5317718 We wouldn't --<br />I-I wouldn't allow it.
5317819 5320420 He -- He wasn't 18.<br />He was still a kid.
5322924 5327195 And there were blowups,<br />got pretty bad.
5327295 5330097 We told him he couldn't<br />see her anymore.
5333067 5335002 He tried to run away,
5335102 5338840 and we took away his phone.
5338940 5341542 Uh, we hid the car<br />keys, credit cards.
5343644 5345646 -Did he ever get violent?
5348783 5350551 He -- He shoved me once<br />trying to get out the door,
5350651 5352352 but he -- he's skinny.
5352452 5355756 It wasn't -- wasn't real.
5358391 5361162 -Mr. Mueller,<br />can you take us
5361262 5363363 through the night of May 25th?
5364464 5367235 - Uh...
5367335 5369070 Uh...
5371371 5376177 It was Daisy's opening<br />night of "Oklahoma."
5376277 5380447 Uh, she was so good in it.
5381983 5385052 And Brian played oboe<br />in the orchestra.
5385987 5388522 And we all went<br />to Friday's after.
5389991 5392894 Uh, Brian was quiet.
5394996 5396631 We came home.
5396731 5398366 Sharon and Daisy went to bed.
5398465 5401602 I went to turn out<br />the back porch light.
5402937 5407208 I saw Brian sitting in<br />the backyard on the trampoline,
5407308 5409677 like how we would do when he...
5416050 5418653 ...when he was a kid.
5418753 5420821 Um...
5420922 5425626 When I asked if<br />he was coming in,
5425726 5427628 he said, "In a minute."
5429530 5433466 Next morning, I-I-I<br />was up early for work,
5433567 5436137 and I saw two...
5436237 5442209 I-I-I-I thought there<br />were animals maybe sleeping,
5442310 5444779 lying on the trampoline.
5446314 5448916 It -- It was Brian and, uh...
5450251 5453087 -Verbally, please.<br />-Christine.
5463097 5464665 They had empty...
5468369 5471138 ...prescription<br />bottles around them,
5471238 5475743 uh, Klonopin, Xanax.
5475843 5479613 Uh, they were her mother's,<br />I guess, uh, Mrs. Hawthorne.
5481481 5484018 I called an ambulance.
5484118 5487555 I performed CPR<br />until they got there.
5490624 5492226 Christine woke up.
5497131 5501035 I'm very sorry for your loss.
5503404 5507241 And you blame Miss Hawthorne<br />for providing the drugs
5507341 5511679 and Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne for<br />not keeping them more secure?
5517551 5519453 -I think Christine<br />having access
5519553 5521822 to those substances<br />made it easier.
5521922 5525092 I'm not sure they woulda gone<br />through with it otherwise.
5525192 5527762 -But they may have.<br />I mean, you can't be sure.
5527862 5530931 -I-I find it difficult to<br />understand any of what they did.
5537605 5540107 I'm trying to understand...
5544912 5547648 ...how bad you two<br />must have felt...
5549617 5552653 ...t-to do -- to do something<br />like that.
5559093 5562930 I know it isn't easy,<br />and if it had gone differently,
5563030 5565800 we could be sitting on<br />that side of the table.
5572873 5576744 I'm angry with you,<br />and you, and him,
5576844 5580247 and myself!
5586587 5588823 I'm heartbroken.
5594361 5596630 I'm not sorry you woke up.
5600201 5602036 I just wish he had, too.
5610579 5612646 It's not your fault.
5630464 5631966 Sharon, wait.
5632066 5636337 -Why did you make us<br />do this, all this time,
5636437 5640609 this emotional -- so much<br />money that we don't have?
5640708 5643978 No! You don't think that<br />I wanna disappear
5644078 5648082 every time shit gets<br />hard, to scream?
5649483 5651085 I am exhausted.
5651185 5654121 I've been holding this<br />family together by a thread.
5656257 5660194 I want to mourn him.
5661596 5664031 I haven't gotten to start.
5674041 5676043 It's not fair that<br />you get to be the hero
5676143 5678312 when you haven't<br />done any of the work.
5683050 5684586 -Dad, just get in the car.
5738607 5739974 -Two?<br />-Tommy Grant.
5740074 5742409 -Tommy, Tommy.<br />Oh, there you are, gotcha.
5742510 5745079 Here you are, good.<br />Gotta stay for the whole thing.
5745179 5747748 -Okay.<br />-The -- The whole thing, okay?
5747848 5750084 -Who are all these people?
5750184 5752621 -Mrs. Nolan's literature class,
5752721 5755657 I had her assign extra<br />credit for coming.
5762863 5767001 -How are you doing?<br />Those are beautiful flowers.
5767101 5768969 -They're for Daisy.<br />-Oh, that's nice.
5769069 5771105 -Where'd you guys go to dinner?
5773240 5775409 - Oh, God.
5775510 5777244 -Okay.<br />-Ah!
5777344 5782283 -So this is it, and, um,<br />you all know what to do,
5782383 5785352 so I won't repeat myself.
5785452 5789823 Project, back of the house, and<br />if, uh, anything goes wrong...
5789923 5792926 -And it will.<br />-...help each other.
5794128 5796397 Okay.
5796497 5799033 -Come on.<br />Come on.
5800535 5802637 What do we say?
5802737 5805205 -Don't fuck up.
5805306 5807474 -Don't fuck up!<br />-Don't fuck up!
5814882 5817951 -Good luck, honey.<br />-You don't say "good luck."
5823023 5825159 It's break a leg.
5827562 5829396 -Break a leg.
5844144 5846781 -Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
5860160 5864398 -Two households,<br />both alike in dignity
5864498 5867602 in fair Verona where<br />we lay our scene.
5867702 5870070 From ancient grudge<br />break new mutiny
5870170 5873941 where civil blood makes<br />civil hands unclean.
5874041 5876977 From forth the fatal<br />loins of these two foes,
5877077 5881448 a pair of star-crossed<br />lovers take their life
5881549 5884952 whose misadventured<br />piteous overthrows doth,
5885052 5888389 with their death, bury<br />their parents' strife.
5890023 5892794 -You bite your<br />thumb at us, sir?
5892893 5894729 -I do bite my thumb, sir.
5894829 5896930 -You bite<br />your thumb at us, sir?
5897030 5898533 -Do you quarrel, sir?
5898633 5900568 -Draw if you be men.
5900668 5902102 - Back up, Daisy.
5907374 5909943 -Halt, fools.<br />Put up your swords.
5910043 5912514 You know not what you do.
5912614 5914616 Oh, where is Romeo?
5914716 5916450 Saw you him today?
5917384 5919987 -Hardest part is<br />the first line, right?
5920087 5921723 -All downhill from there.
5926226 5929898 -Good morrow, cousin.<br />-Is the day so young?
5929997 5933133 -But new struck nine.<br />-Aye, me,
5933233 5934935 sad hours seem long.
5935035 5937672 - Whoo, Danny!
5967167 5969838 -If I profane with<br />my unworthiest hand
5969938 5973073 this holy shrine,<br />the gentle sin is this,
5973173 5974809 my lips two blushing pilgrims,
5974909 5979213 ready stand to smooth that<br />rough touch with a gentle kiss.
6003403 6005439 -Romeo.
6005540 6009711 O, Romeo,
6009811 6012112 wherefore art thou, Romeo?
6013213 6016784 -Soft, what light through<br />yonder window breaks?
6018085 6021723 It is the east,<br />and Juliet is the sun.
6031866 6033233 I am too bold.
6035035 6036804 -Dan, uh, you okay, bro?
6038573 6040207 -I'm good.
6043310 6046280 -Did you hear that applause?<br />I love that sound.
6046380 6048115 -Oh, Dan, you were on fire.
6048215 6050150 -Oh, so were you<br />with that sword fight.
6051686 6053588 -All right, just don't breathe.<br />-I'm not.
6053688 6055289 I'm gonna be late<br />for my entrance. Come on.
6055389 6057025 -I know, I know, I know.<br />It's almost good.
6057124 6058325 -And, Jonah, your Capulet.
6058425 6059827 -I ad-libbed a little.<br />Could you tell?
6059928 6061328 -Yes.<br />-Okay, that's good.
6061428 6062864 That's good. Let's go, let's go.<br />-Okay, go, go, go.
6062964 6065399 -Come on.
6108175 6110778 -Love your performance.<br />-Thanks.
6110878 6112747 -Better than Broadway.
6114448 6118485 -Gentlemen, good day,<br />a word with one of you?
6118586 6121789 -Oh, make it a word and a blow.
6121889 6124491 -Here's my fiddlestick.
6126159 6129731 -Romeo, thou art the villain.
6130632 6133467 -I do protest.<br />I never injured thee
6133568 6135637 but love the better<br />than thou canst divine.
6135737 6138873 -O, calm, dishonorable,<br />vile submission.
6140642 6144112 -Ah, gentle Mercutio,<br />put thy rapier up.
6144211 6146714 Ah! Ohh!
6154221 6156189 I am hurt.
6159259 6161428 -Courage, man.
6161529 6163898 The hurt can't be much.
6167568 6172540 -A plague on both your houses.
6193728 6197699 - I am fortune's fool.
6205006 6206741 Are you okay?<br />-Yeah, are you?
6206841 6209443 Let's bring this baby home.
6214882 6219419 -Hold, daughter, I do<br />spy a kind of hope.
6232133 6234569 - Come on, Dan.
6251719 6253453 -Oh, my love.
6276276 6280014 Death that hath sucked
6280114 6283584 the honey of thy breath...
6285520 6288556 ...hath had no power<br />yet upon thy beauty.
6292927 6295696 Why art thou yet so fair?
6311212 6316584 Here, here will I remain,
6316684 6321522 here I will set up<br />my everlasting rest.
6327460 6331032 Eyes, look your last.
6335069 6337738 Arms, take your last embrace.
6346547 6350751 And lips, oh, you<br />the doors of breath...
6352352 6354522 ...seal with a righteous kiss.
6387221 6389156 Here's to my love.
6417151 6418552 -Romeo.
6421989 6423423 What's here?
6426027 6429931 Poison I see hath<br />been his timeless end,
6430031 6434001 drunk all and left no friendly<br />drop to help me after.
6439340 6443177 Oh, happy dagger,
6443277 6446414 this is thy sheath.
6446514 6449750 There rust, and let me die.
6472740 6476610 -A glooming peace this<br />morning with it brings.
6476711 6480548 The sun for sorrow<br />shall not show its head.
6482550 6485987 Some will be pardoned<br />and some punished.
6488456 6491258 For never was there<br />a story of more woe...
6493094 6496097 ...than this of Juliet
6496197 6497865 and her Romeo.
6547615 6549283 -Hi.<br />-That was really, really great.
6549383 6552186 -Thanks.
6552286 6554622 -Dan, that was amazing.
6555589 6558826 -Holy cow, dude,<br />you made me cry.
6562963 6564765 Congrats.
6577178 6579548 -Mom.
6579647 6582450 -You were fantastic.<br />-Yeah?
6585352 6587221 -No more plays where you die.
6617586 6619653 -I'm not even tired.
6619753 6621989 Bye, guys, bye.
6628329 6629663 -Dan.
6638372 6641008 Next time, we'll do a comedy.
6662730 6665933 -Come on, guys,<br />hey, hey, we're home.
6667536 6669336 Come on.
6669436 6670471 -Come on. Come on.<br />Come on.
6672574 6674175 -Dad.
