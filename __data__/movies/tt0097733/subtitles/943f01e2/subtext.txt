27611 30447 I love this job!<br />Can't you go faster?
30697 32616 - Floor this thing!<br />- It's my wife's.
32866 35577 - I won't go faster.<br />- You're doing 65 now.
35827 37371 65?! Shit!
37621 41917 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
43085 46338 We're eastbound on Fourth,<br />in pursuit of a red BMW...
46588 48131 ...driver Caucasian, blond.
48382 52219 <i>Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.</i>
52594 55848 <i>You are westbound on Second.<br />20-William-12 is southbound...</i>
56098 59560 ...approaching Second.<br />You're heading right for each other.
59810 61687 <i>- Somebody back off.<br />- Got it!</i>
61937 65315 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
65566 70153 - You're gonna get us killed!<br />- Shit! I'm...
83792 87754 We'll stick with this red<br />son of a bitch. You chase the blue.
88005 91592 20-William-15, that's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
91842 96346 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.
96597 98390 - Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And the squad.
98640 101185 - $ 20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
101435 103061 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
103312 106398 I knew nothing about the wife's<br />station wagon. Bet's off!
106648 109234 Shut up!
117117 118410 What the hell is that?
118660 121079 What fucking language is that?
121330 122789 It's German.
123040 123957 Japanese?
124208 127127 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the LAPD.
127377 129963 They own everything.
134176 137095 Shotgun!
144520 146647 Shots are being fired.
146897 148607 Thanks for the scoop.
148857 151485 The son of a bitch shot<br />my wife's windshield.
151735 154530 Entering the pursuit.
166416 170671 Shit, man!<br />We're splitting up!
173549 177302 Son of a bitch!<br />Now we're cooking!
179888 182266 Step on it!
193902 196446 Look out!
202035 204746 See you!
224433 228770 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
242951 245370 We got one.<br />Yours is going up the hill.
245621 248457 <i>So is Riggs, on foot!</i>
250751 253879 Hey, Riggs!<br />Get your slow ass in here!
254129 255923 Get in here. Now!
256173 257132 Only if I drive.
257382 259009 Move over, I'll drive.
259259 261678 No, go around. I'm driving.
261929 264848 I'll drive.
265015 267518 Did you get a make<br />on that red Beemer yet?
267768 270729 Not a scratch, you hear?
274483 276026 You're not gonna make it.
276276 277569 There's no room!
277819 280239 You're not gonna make it!
280489 284535 Look at my side panel!
292960 295546 Goddamn it, you were right, you know.
295796 299424 There wasn't enough room.
313689 317609 Get down! Get down!
317693 321196 Get down, stay down!
360360 363322 He's making a hard right.
371205 374583 Get out of the way!
387888 389640 This was a new car, Riggs.
389890 392476 It still is.
398607 400234 On three.
400484 401818 One...
402069 405197 ...two... three!
405447 408158 Shit!
408325 410452 You forgot your left indicator.
410702 413080 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
413330 416291 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamn it!
416542 417960 Me?! Where'd he go?!
418210 420879 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
421129 424049 - You come on "three"!<br />- It's "three", then go!
424299 426051 No! We always go on "three"!
426301 430347 Sometimes we go,<br />"one, two, three", then go!
430597 434393 Go check back there!
437145 439857 What was that?
440482 444319 - He's in the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
449533 451577 Holy Christ!
451827 455289 That's a lot of money.
457374 459543 What is this?
459793 461587 It's gold!
461837 463130 Fucking gold!
463380 464464 Krugerrands.
464715 467718 It's illegal. You can't<br />import this into the country.
467968 469094 You're right.
469344 472806 The damage you caused comes<br />out of the department's budget.
473056 476935 - Pay it off in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
477186 479271 You came up empty,<br />I want an explanation.
479521 483275 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said it was a routine bust.
483525 488572 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
488822 490991 This was bigger than we thought.
491241 494203 Talk to you later.
499082 503253 I worked psycho ward, Riggs.<br />You'll never get out.
503504 505881 One minute, 15 seconds.
506131 509218 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
509468 514097 What's going on here? Is this a<br />kindergarten class or a police station?
514348 516308 Let's get some work done.
516558 519186 Houdini Jr. Bets he can<br />free himself in five minutes.
519436 521939 I will too.
525651 529279 Don't try this at home, kids.
537621 539081 It's all over now.
539331 544002 Put your money on the table,<br />and get back to work.
544461 547339 Suckers!
549967 551844 Somebody check that thing, man.
552094 555681 How the hell did you do that?
555931 559518 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />I can do it whenever I want to now.
559768 561353 Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?
561603 563981 Yeah, it does.
564231 565816 But not as much as...
566066 569361 ...when I put it back in.
578412 580664 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
580914 584001 My door is always open, sergeant.
584251 588755 I think we ought to keep this<br />on a professional level, don't you?
589006 591884 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
592134 595053 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
595304 596722 And I need the money.
596972 599349 Cough up!
600559 604938 It's not all here yet.<br />I want it all. I want the lot.
610527 613071 Where did this come from?
613322 615449 You can't help yourself to this stuff.
615699 618410 This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
618660 621288 - That's mine. I won that.<br />- It's not yours.
621538 624791 You want to get busted?
625042 627002 Want to get something to eat?
627252 630255 Not tonight.<br />Rianne's commercial is on.
630506 633300 - Rianne's in a commercial?<br />- Not so loud!
633550 636970 What's the matter?<br />I'd be proud of her if I was you.
637221 640682 I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.<br />What if she stinks?
640933 642851 You gotta be kidding.<br />She'll be great!
643101 645437 Everybody, listen up!
645687 647814 Tonight at...<br />What time?
648065 648982 Come on!
649233 651068 What time?
651318 652194 8:00.
652444 655781 At 8:00 on channel...?
656657 659660 Eight. The sergeant's<br />beautiful daughter Rianne...
659910 662246 Here's her picture.
662496 667543 She'll make her television debut<br />in a commercial.
672422 676927 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
688730 692568 - Thought I'd get a new windshield.<br />- Don't worry, it'll be fine.
692818 695070 - The hood.<br />- We got a new hood on order.
695320 697406 - No bumper.<br />- We got a bumper on order.
697656 699616 See you back at your place, Rog.
699867 703161 - If you ever get there.<br />- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
703412 706039 Be careful.<br />The mirror's got tape around it.
706290 710169 Oh, boy. Shit.
721805 725184 What happened? This was a new car.<br />Mom's gonna be upset!
725434 728187 - It's still new.<br />- It's not! It's wrecked!
728437 731899 I don't want your mother to know<br />about it.
732149 733692 Do your homework too.
733942 736862 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
737112 739531 Why don't you look out for me?
739781 744119 Hey, Ricky! I want to use<br />my driveway once in a while.
744369 746163 Nice oxygen tent.
746413 750042 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
750292 754463 This is a two-car garage, and this is<br />my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.
754713 758550 I retire when I'm 52, and the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
758800 761345 Cut it out.<br />You're not retiring, are you?
761595 764598 - I've thought of it since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
764848 769811 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
771313 772356 Jesus Christ!
772606 774399 What's wrong with you guys?
774650 776777 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
777027 779905 You're sorry?<br />Check my shorts, for chrissakes!
780155 783116 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
783367 784743 Easy, easy.
784993 789498 It's no Saturday night special,<br />for crying out loud.
789748 793085 All right, give it back.
793377 795212 A man's not safe in his own home.
795462 797756 Stay the hell out of here, then.
798006 799633 You got any traffic warrants?
799883 802719 Why? Can you fix them?
808433 810686 Almost time.<br />Are we taping this?
810936 813814 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
814064 815357 Take the stairs.
815607 818777 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
819027 821947 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
822197 823824 I want my baby to look good.
824074 824825 Unplug it.
825075 826285 That's your sister!
826535 827911 Picture's perfect.
828162 830205 You think so?
830455 831623 Do I know you?
831874 832708 Yes, sir.
832958 835669 We had a long talk about a week ago.<br />Remember?
835919 837337 We did? About what?
837588 842176 - About your new hobby room.<br />- This is George!
842759 846513 - How you doing?<br />- Did you sense that I liked you?
846763 848515 Yes, sir.
848765 852311 Then sit down and be quiet.
853896 856940 - What's that you're eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
857191 858609 Tuna?!
858859 860819 Daddy, you can't eat tuna.
861069 862487 Dad killed Flipper.
862738 864406 We're boycotting tuna.
864656 868994 They kill the dolphins that get caught<br />in the nets. Only albacore.
869244 870329 Have ham.
870579 872873 Eat Miss Piggy.
873123 876793 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
880297 883675 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
885093 887221 My baby!
887471 891183 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
898774 900943 <i>When the time has come...</i>
901193 904029 <i>... and the moment is right...</i>
904279 905697 <i>... remember...</i>
905948 909034 <i>... use Ramses Extra Condoms.</i>
909284 910160 <i>We do!</i>
910410 912037 <i>Ramses Extra.</i>
912287 917167 <i>Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.</i>
924967 927094 Take the kids upstairs.
927344 929137 We learn this in human development.
929388 931807 In human what?!<br />Human development what?!
932057 933725 Development. Chill out.
933976 935143 Upstairs.
935394 937229 Nick, upstairs.
937479 939648 You know how your father is.
939898 943902 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
944611 946655 Home. Out.
946905 949449 George, I got a gun.
953370 955581 What's with you?<br />She looked beautiful.
955831 961086 I liked it. She made me want<br />to buy rubbers right now.
966508 970220 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was just...
970470 972890 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
973140 975017 I think she's got a future.<br />Don't you?
975267 977978 - Yeah, she was good.<br />- George is afraid of Daddy.
978228 979563 Stick around.
979813 981106 Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.
981356 985319 Yeah, but it's an old gun,<br />and he's not a very good shot.
985569 988030 That's good.<br />I'm going anyway. Good night.
988280 990949 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- Let him buy the beer.
991200 992367 You're under 21.
992618 995162 Be back by midnight.
995412 997873 Wait and see.<br />Cops never let up, you know?
998123 1001793 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />in the mail, in the coffee...
1002044 1006590 If you'd only shut your mouth. You<br />told everybody. I'm going for a walk.
1006840 1011512 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
1023190 1025192 How goes it with you, Hans?
1025442 1028403 Okay. You, Pieter?
1028654 1033283 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1033659 1037788 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having some painting done.
1038038 1041041 The important thing is,<br />are you all right?
1041291 1043502 No bones broken?
1043752 1045045 I'm fine, thank you.
1045295 1047548 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1047798 1049174 Yeah, that's all.
1049424 1052511 Good, good.
1054471 1058559 However, we did lose over $ 1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1058809 1062187 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1062437 1063814 It happens.
1064064 1066066 It's not your fault.
1066316 1069778 Sometimes these things<br />do not go as planned.
1070028 1075075 As you say, they just happen,<br />eh, Pieter?
1081707 1085544 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word "dropcloth".
1085794 1090215 Certain policemen in this city<br />have become an intolerable nuisance.
1090465 1094928 They are obviously onto us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1095179 1098223 Warn them off.
1098390 1100601 It's my experience...
1100851 1103896 ...that a scared cop is<br />more useful than a dead one.
1104146 1105564 A warning?
1105814 1107941 Is that not a bit tame?
1108192 1111028 Depends how you do it.
1111361 1114865 Then you'd better look at this.
1119745 1124791 This is the policeman in charge.
1125876 1128670 Goddamn "kaffir".
1128795 1130797 Lovely.
1131048 1133425 Remember to take these in order.
1133675 1136929 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1137179 1138013 Thank you.
1138263 1140265 This yours?
1140516 1143560 I found it in the wash.
1146813 1148524 Thanks.
1148774 1151193 I keep on losing this.
1151443 1152528 Something's wrong.
1152778 1157908 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1159326 1160869 What about the pen?
1161119 1163831 It just reminds me of something.
1164081 1165791 Reminds you of what?
1166041 1167668 It reminds me of...
1167918 1170712 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1170963 1173799 I didn't mean to push.
1173799 1178053 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1181515 1185894 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1186144 1189064 I had so much work.
1189940 1193360 I forgot about the whole thing.
1193527 1199366 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1199408 1203579 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1203829 1207791 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.
1211795 1216633 I should've been driving.<br />We'd have been all right.
1217509 1221430 I remember falling down on my knees,<br />and I started shaking all over.
1221680 1225350 I remember thinking,<br />"I'm just losing it".
1225601 1229229 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1229479 1234193 Lying there, and I'm seeing under<br />the couch, and I see this gold pen...
1234443 1235694 ...just lying there.
1235944 1241241 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1241450 1245120 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1245245 1249541 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1249791 1253337 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1253587 1255881 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1256131 1258091 Muscles were still working.
1258342 1261053 Then I drove to the hospital...
1261303 1264306 ...identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.
1264556 1269394 Gold pen? Trish found<br />a gold pen in the laundry.
1277236 1280781 Look around you, Sam.<br />Look around you.
1281031 1283283 One day, Sam...
1283534 1286870 ...this'll all be yours.
1288789 1292459 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1292709 1296505 A man could live here and be happy.
1299216 1303011 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?
1303262 1306598 Let's go watch some TV.
1394269 1397147 "Kaffirs!"
1398899 1401401 Wondering about your kids?
1401652 1404530 You wondering what we done to them?
1404780 1408200 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1408450 1411411 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1411662 1413664 Want to know what we done?
1413914 1416291 Shall I tell you?
1416792 1419962 You just let your imagination<br />run riot.
1420212 1422214 This has just been a warning.
1422464 1426218 After this, it gets bloody.<br />You tell your people to back off.
1426468 1428595 Don't be a smart "kaffir".
1428846 1433183 Maybe we let you live, huh?<br />Come on, let's go.
1451493 1454454 - You didn't see a face?<br />- Not one. They all had on hoods.
1454705 1455914 What about a voice?
1456165 1460711 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1460961 1462588 Not German, not English.
1462838 1465632 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1465883 1469386 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1469636 1472222 Yeah, kind of like that.
1472472 1473849 Trish and the kids?
1474099 1476935 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1477186 1481565 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?
1481815 1483775 Forensics get back with anything?
1484026 1486236 Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.
1486486 1489781 The point being, we gotta watch<br />each other's backs and fronts.
1490032 1493869 You're all invited to watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1494119 1498665 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1502711 1505339 I got something special for you boys.
1505589 1508509 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1508759 1512596 You guys are gonna babysit him<br />until Washington sends the feds.
1512846 1515933 - How long?<br />- Soon as the red tape is processed.
1516183 1517476 Three days.
1517726 1521813 This guy Getz is gonna testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1522064 1524483 Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.
1524733 1528195 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1528237 1529988 This is not a shit assignment.
1530239 1532241 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1532491 1534368 - It isn't.<br />- It's a shit assignment.
1534618 1536119 Shut up, the both of you.
1536370 1537412 Here you go, sir.
1537663 1540040 - I guaranteed this guy's safety.<br />- Why us?
1540290 1543627 Because you two are<br />the most qualified for the job.
1543877 1546713 And after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1546964 1549258 I can handle last night.
1549508 1550759 What do we do with him?
1551009 1553262 How should I know?<br />Take him to Disneyland.
1553512 1555264 This stinks. This stinks.
1555514 1556682 I don't give a fuck.
1556932 1560060 I don't have an ulcer,<br />because I know when to say that.
1560310 1562729 Here's where he's staying.<br />It's a nice hotel.
1562980 1567276 Expenses are paid by the Justice<br />Department, so enjoy yourselves.
1567526 1570487 One more thing.
1571947 1573031 Know what that says?
1573282 1577536 Same thing as that.<br />But I don't give a fuck.
1579955 1584376 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1595804 1598515 What a joint!
1598765 1602186 Excuse me, ma'am, where's the lobby?
1602436 1604271 That's this way.
1604521 1606899 Hey, come on. Come on.
1607149 1609943 What I wouldn't pay to have this pool<br />in my back yard.
1610194 1611069 You can't swim.
1611320 1614656 I could get my stroke down.
1615073 1616909 - What's the water like?<br />- Great.
1617159 1619995 - How's the temperature?<br />- Great. Why don't you come in?
1620245 1624833 As an employee, I can't get into these<br />things. If I get caught, I get fired.
1625083 1627336 Everything okay for you at the hotel?
1627586 1629671 No problem?<br />Nothing I can do for you?
1629922 1633091 Excuse me. I see you're coming out<br />of your shell.
1633342 1635302 - Hotel psychiatrist.<br />- Join us also.
1635552 1639223 Our patient, Mr. Getz, is waiting<br />for us upstairs.
1639473 1640807 Want to talk to Mr. Murphy?
1641058 1643769 Yeah, I gotta go to work. Bye.
1644019 1645812 - Come back.<br />- We'll be waiting.
1646063 1649775 Can any of you cook?
1650025 1651735 Let's go. Murphy.
1651985 1655155 The girls in this place.<br />This is where they live in the day.
1655405 1657741 This is where my tax money goes too.
1657991 1659493 Leo lives like this.
1659743 1661495 Where's the elevator?
1661745 1663539 Down the hall to the right.
1663789 1667835 Are you gentlemen guests of the hotel?
1671046 1672506 Excuse me.
1672756 1674424 What room is that for?
1674675 1677135 612.
1678470 1681807 This is it. 612.
1682891 1684726 - Who is it?<br />- Police.
1684977 1686353 How do I know that?
1686603 1691608 After I shoot you through the door,<br />you can examine the bullet.
1691942 1694069 Don't you want to see a badge?
1694319 1695696 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1695946 1698448 I get it.<br />Bad cop, good cop.
1698699 1701076 Shut up!
1701326 1703537 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1703787 1706748 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1706999 1710752 Whatever you need, Leo gets.<br />You get it?
1711003 1713839 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1714089 1716049 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.<br />This is Sgt. Riggs.
1716300 1719511 How you doing? Nice to meet you.<br />What do I call you guys?
1719761 1724600 - Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.<br />- We're gonna be your shadow.
1725267 1728437 That's all right.<br />An old-fashioned...!
1728687 1731690 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1731940 1734735 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1734985 1738030 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1738280 1739406 Yep, a Beretta.
1739656 1741533 Don't touch it.
1741783 1744036 You sure you guys are cops?
1744286 1749541 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm the state's star witness.
1749541 1751793 We'll take that room.
1752044 1757549 Actually, I already have my stuff<br />in this room. You know, when I...
1762221 1764014 It's yours. My stuff's gone.
1764264 1766683 I'll move it in the small room, okay?
1766934 1770354 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1770604 1775442 Come on, loosen up a little, guys.<br />We'll be together a long time.
1775692 1777528 I'll get it.
1777778 1780072 It's only room service.
1780322 1782908 You hungry? I'll call<br />and get anything you want.
1783158 1785619 See this silk robe?<br />Silk pajamas? Free!
1785869 1787454 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is!
1787704 1792334 - It's taxpayers'money.<br />- Oh, God! It's the same thing.
1794419 1797506 Good morning, gentlemen.
1799842 1804137 That's my food! You guys didn't<br />want anything. Bring it here.
1804388 1806139 It's mine. Boy!
1806390 1809101 You could've had anything you wanted.
1809351 1812646 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1817192 1820320 Martin, not the window!
1821613 1824241 Shit!
1848432 1851393 Where is that son of a bitch?
1851727 1855981 Somebody stop that guy!<br />Stop him!
1856231 1860027 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1860277 1861987 Get off me!
1862237 1864781 Get off me!
1865240 1870037 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back.
1870287 1873582 Clear, move it! Get back! Police!
1873832 1874625 You all right?
1874875 1877628 I'm okay.<br />Why didn't you follow me down?
1877878 1881381 - Why didn't you?<br />- I was seven floors up!
1881632 1882674 He hit me.
1882925 1885511 Good!
1886094 1888972 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1889223 1890974 Did you witness a murder?
1891225 1894895 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1895812 1901235 All I did was, I laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1901485 1903445 Half a billion dollars?
1903695 1907324 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1907574 1911203 Could I please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1911453 1913580 Could you please shut up?
1913831 1917167 - You're supposed to take care of me.<br />- Shut up!
1917417 1921547 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1921797 1926927 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1927177 1929096 What are you doing?
1929346 1933308 Just checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1933559 1935644 Okay, I got it. Okay, here.
1935894 1939398 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1939648 1942359 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1942609 1944945 I bring it to you.
1945195 1948323 - He does.<br />- Me? I don't understand. Why me?
1948574 1949741 Who am I?
1949992 1951451 I'll tell you.
1951702 1954079 You're a courier. You work for him.
1954329 1957708 I'm the drug dealer.
1959418 1964756 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1965048 1970596 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1970846 1974183 Then I issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1974433 1977769 ...minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1978020 1979730 - You like breathing?<br />- How much?
1979980 1981481 Two percent.
1981732 1986403 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1986862 1990073 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1990324 1993869 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1994119 1995078 How's that work?
1995329 1997915 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1998165 2002044 It's your money. You don't pay<br />it back. It's yours, and it's clean!
2002294 2005714 It is now laundered.
2005964 2009760 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
2010052 2012596 This is the best part. You got it?
2012846 2016016 You take a tax deduction...
2016266 2020854 ...on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
2021104 2023524 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
2023774 2024733 Cheat!
2024983 2026485 Come on.
2026735 2029321 Everybody cheats.<br />Look at the Pentagon.
2029571 2032407 So you got it?
2032866 2036161 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
2036411 2038872 I was scamming those guys for months.
2039122 2041041 Every transaction, I kept a little.
2041291 2042417 You?
2042668 2044920 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
2045170 2048382 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
2048632 2052469 Who's gonna miss $ 10,000 here,<br />$ 20,000 there?
2052719 2054471 Drug dealers.
2054721 2056473 That's right. They did.
2056723 2060936 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
2061979 2063939 You can give that to Nick.
2064189 2067234 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
2067484 2068485 It's small, Leroy.
2068735 2072865 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I'll buy you another shirt!
2073115 2076034 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
2076285 2080038 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
2080289 2085460 - Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />- On the shelf in back of the machine.
2085711 2089673 You never met anyone except couriers?
2089756 2092718 No names.
2094428 2097556 Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br />Come to think of it...
2097806 2098974 Okay, listen.
2099224 2103061 They took me up to the hills<br />in this house with stilts on it.
2103312 2106231 And I had a job interview<br />with a guy...
2106481 2109193 ...and his name was...
2109443 2110944 ...Haynes. Hans!
2111195 2113489 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2113739 2115699 It won't do any harm to look.
2115949 2118035 - I know the address.<br />- Let's go.
2118285 2119203 We shouldn't!
2119453 2121455 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2121705 2124249 We're back, we're bad!<br />You're black, I'm mad.
2124500 2126376 This is going to be great!
2126627 2131048 If we're going,<br />shouldn't I have a gun?
2131965 2134426 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2134676 2137888 I'm sorry about that.
2143810 2146939 That's downtown L.A.<br />How'd you like to have a house here?
2147189 2150609 It'd be okay three days of the year<br />when you can actually see it.
2150859 2153987 Get a fresh breath.
2154071 2157157 It's been two hours and six places.<br />You sure of the address?
2157407 2160118 I told you I wasn't sure<br />of the exact address.
2160369 2161537 What are you sure of?
2161787 2163705 I'm sure the numbers add up to 28.
2163956 2168752 I remember because I was 28 when I<br />became a certified public accountant.
2169002 2170587 We can figure this out.
2170838 2173632 There's four numbers.<br />The first one has to be a nine.
2173882 2178554 Nine is my lucky number. I was born<br />on the ninth day of the ninth month.
2178804 2183767 - This is ridiculous.<br />- Hang on. Maybe not, maybe not.
2184142 2187229 There aren't many streets<br />in Bel Air that begin with nine...
2187479 2189481 ...with four numbers in the address.
2189731 2194153 - How many's not that many?<br />- Let's have a look.
2197990 2200826 Well, I meant more than<br />10 or 12 streets.
2201076 2203495 This is thin, Riggs.<br />This is very thin.
2203745 2205497 This is anorexic.
2205747 2209251 - Such as 739, 658.
2209501 2211003 Okay, that's it.
2211253 2212796 That's it.
2213046 2215007 Look. This is it. See?
2215257 2218218 The last three numbers have to be<br />either 739 or 658.
2218468 2221889 The first number's gotta be a 9<br />because 9 was my lucky number.
2222139 2225058 I was born on the ninth day...<br />See, that's it.
2225309 2226894 I tell you, I could do it.
2227144 2228061 Take us there.
2228312 2232357 - We need a street, that's all.<br />- Is that all?
2232399 2235569 - How's that?<br />- Good enough for me.
2235819 2237738 Leo, this is the seventh place.
2237988 2240324 - We have the numbers.<br />- And the seventh time.
2240574 2244870 - Just jumble them around.<br />- It's a lucky number.
2246830 2248624 It should be coming up soon.
2248874 2251126 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2251376 2254671 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility.
2254922 2258133 That's it! Nine. My lucky number.
2258383 2261678 Stay in the car, you hear?
2261929 2265307 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2266058 2267601 Nice car.
2267851 2269728 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2269978 2272022 You're not looking<br />at what you're doing!
2272272 2276276 I know what I'm doing. I'm towing<br />your car, not a baby carriage.
2276527 2279530 You're chipping the paint.<br />I can hear it!
2279780 2282616 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell something.
2282866 2284660 What's that? A rat?
2284910 2288330 A stinky one too.
2290290 2291500 Where you going?
2291750 2294419 I'm a peeping Tom.<br />It goes with the badge.
2294670 2297673 It's fun sometimes too.
2298131 2300551 Bingo!
2303303 2304721 Lars, look!
2304972 2308350 What the fuck?
2311770 2313897 - Where's the pool?<br />- There's no pool.
2314147 2315065 There's no pool.
2315315 2317192 This house is built on stilts.
2317442 2321155 Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.
2331498 2334418 Cuff yourselves.
2339882 2343051 Not this again.
2353687 2355939 Riggs! Where you at?
2356190 2358942 Stay where you are. Don't move.
2359193 2360444 You all right?
2360694 2363447 Move that truck.
2363614 2366200 Give me your keys!
2367117 2368869 You all right?
2369119 2370078 Where you going?
2370329 2371747 That was the hotel waiter.
2371997 2373457 Wait for me!
2373707 2374833 Get out of here!
2375083 2380547 What are you doing? You can't<br />take my truck! What's going on?
2381840 2385469 Don't worry.<br />We'll bring it right back.
2391183 2392059 Gotcha!
2392309 2394645 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2394895 2396772 Where did he go?
2397022 2398815 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2399066 2403028 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2403278 2405697 Get back! It's police business!
2405948 2410327 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2427845 2432182 Go faster! We gotta catch him<br />and your partner.
2446071 2449074 Hello, asshole!
2477477 2481273 Come on, come on. Give me that!
2495746 2498290 There they are! Hurry up!
2498540 2500375 Come on! Can't you go faster?
2500626 2504213 Will you shut the fuck up?
2510177 2512763 Look out!
2553053 2556056 Oh, shit!
2580372 2582541 Wipeout! It's all under control.
2582791 2586336 I told you to look out!
2587171 2590174 - You're too old to drive this car.<br />- Shut up!
2590424 2591341 And stay!
2591592 2594887 What do you think I am, a dog?
2607608 2610736 Hands behind your neck!
2614323 2617659 What are you doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2617910 2618994 What's going on?
2619244 2621371 Freeze, dickhead!
2621622 2624208 Get down here, dickhead.<br />It's been a bad day.
2624458 2625584 Show me your hands.
2625834 2627836 Take it easy, officer.
2628086 2631965 I'm not armed. I won't resist.
2632216 2635302 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right.
2635552 2638680 Do as I say!
2641642 2643435 Get your hands on your head.
2643685 2645229 Lace them behind your head!
2645479 2647564 You have no idea what you're doing.
2647814 2652110 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2652361 2654279 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2654530 2659743 I'm minister of diplomatic affairs<br />for the South African Consulate.
2659993 2661912 South Africa,<br />home of the Krugerrand.
2662162 2663747 Among other things.
2663997 2666708 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2666959 2670796 We have diplomatic credentials...
2671255 2674424 Keep your hands high.
2676885 2679721 Give me that.
2681515 2684309 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2684560 2687521 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2687771 2690983 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2691233 2692526 Pieter Von... Vor...
2692776 2695320 Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.
2695571 2699491 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2699741 2702786 - That's you.<br />- It's official.
2703036 2704955 They are official.
2705205 2707583 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2707833 2711336 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2711587 2716175 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2716550 2720053 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2720304 2723724 ...which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2723974 2727853 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2728103 2730772 My dear officer...
2731023 2735319 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2736987 2740491 Who is the dickhead now?
2742284 2745245 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2745496 2747539 This is South African soil.
2747789 2750459 Now get out of here.
2750709 2753337 All of you.
2756632 2759718 Come on, let's go.
2760636 2761929 Hey, man, don't do it.
2762179 2768393 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I'll make you eat this thing.
2769311 2772064 "Kaffir"!
2772439 2775192 With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2775442 2779238 - I went to school with him.<br />- Yeah, right.
2779530 2784451 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2784827 2788580 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2788789 2791750 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2792125 2794086 Don't open that.
2794336 2795879 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2796129 2799925 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2800175 2803595 Is he serious with this stuff?
2803804 2806598 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2806849 2809726 They were just leaving.
2810894 2813480 She is a consulate secretary.
2813730 2817025 Give her back the briefcase.
2818402 2821321 Give it to her.
2822072 2826326 Here. I'm sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2826535 2828078 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2828328 2831039 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2831290 2835544 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2841258 2845345 I'd start getting used to<br />that sort of view.
2852895 2854980 - It's the Triangle Trade again.<br />- The what?
2855230 2857900 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2858150 2859985 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2860235 2862321 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2862571 2866325 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2866575 2869995 ...and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2870245 2874666 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2874917 2876084 Apologize?
2876335 2878545 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2878795 2881507 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2881757 2886011 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2886261 2888472 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2888722 2889556 Yes, sir.
2889806 2894978 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2895354 2899983 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2900234 2903153 - He's alive, isn't he?<br />- It's okay. I signed a waiver.
2903403 2906824 - Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />- Usually? Usually?
2907074 2909076 They're very adamant about that.
2909326 2912496 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops. They're the best.
2912746 2914998 One time, a guy was waving a gun...
2915249 2918043 What'd he say?
2918669 2919711 What did he say?
2919962 2922256 "I don't give a fuck."<br />It's his mantra.
2922506 2926802 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2927052 2928512 It's a rubber plant!
2928762 2931598 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2931849 2932766 Go spit.
2933016 2937729 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2938856 2942985 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2958041 2961211 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2965132 2968927 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2971722 2974808 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2975058 2978061 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2978312 2980564 Why don't you explain it to me?
2980814 2985402 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2985652 2989698 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2989948 2993368 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2993619 2995829 Our consulate, its staff...
2996079 3001919 ...and particularly myself, will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
3007883 3011220 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
3021021 3022940 Things are getting out of hand.
3023190 3025567 We are suffering too many losses.
3025818 3028529 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
3028779 3031156 We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
3031406 3035244 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
3035494 3039748 Your warning did not work.
3046088 3048006 - Come on, Leo, let's go!<br />- I'm coming.
3048257 3050467 Come on! Move!
3050717 3052928 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
3053178 3056515 - Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />- Come on, Leo.
3056765 3059935 Give me the food.
3063564 3066859 - Who ordered the super combo?<br />- Over here.
3067109 3068861 I get a steak sandwich.
3069111 3070195 Who gets Leo?
3070445 3072197 You got a big, empty house.
3072447 3074741 I got a trailer.<br />What will I do with him?
3074992 3077244 My place is too small. You take him.
3077494 3078829 I had him last night.
3079079 3081415 Excuse me, fellas!
3081665 3083917 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
3084168 3087421 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
3087671 3090924 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- Where were you? I just said that!
3091175 3093468 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
3093719 3095220 We're not going back. Shut up!
3095470 3098390 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
3098640 3101852 Can I give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
3102102 3105731 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
3105981 3107983 You know why? Let me tell you.
3108233 3111695 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
3111945 3115908 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
3116158 3118452 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
3118702 3121497 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
3121747 3123540 I'm not eating this tuna!
3123790 3126835 Shut up!
3198157 3199908 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
3200159 3203620 - Get rid of that man.<br />- Yes, sir.
3204830 3209668 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3217843 3220804 The morning faxes.
3256548 3260344 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3260594 3265015 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3274441 3275859 What are you doing?
3276109 3278028 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3278278 3280364 I like living the way I live.
3280614 3284660 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3284910 3287788 - There's a pan under there?<br />- Oh, please. Come on.
3288038 3290749 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3290999 3292584 Where's my TV?
3292835 3294711 Everything is outside.
3294962 3296547 Just stop what you're doing.
3296797 3299925 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3300175 3303470 Out, out! Oh, man!
3307057 3308892 <i>Riggs, it's Collins.</i>
3309142 3312437 <i>- Has Murtaugh checked in with you?<br />- No, he hasn't. Why?</i>
3312688 3316733 <i>I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.</i>
3316984 3319611 I'll be right there.
3323949 3325325 Stay in the car.
3325576 3328203 Get in there.
3333041 3334501 I'm upstairs!
3334751 3338005 Should I call 999,<br />"Officer in distress"?
3338255 3339381 I'll cover the back!
3339631 3343635 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
3358609 3361403 In here.
3374791 3377377 Good morning.
3382633 3386386 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3386637 3390182 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3390432 3395479 Just me and my new<br />"Salt Water Sportsman" magazine.
3403195 3408116 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3415374 3420212 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3420462 3424341 ...when I glanced over,<br />I saw this.
3427386 3429847 Oh, Jesus!
3430097 3431098 Is that all?
3431348 3436186 - You scared the shit out of me.<br />- Scared the shit out of you?
3436436 3437896 How long you been here?
3438147 3439940 I've been here all night.
3440190 3443026 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if I can...
3443277 3444611 Don't move.
3444862 3446029 I can't.
3446280 3449825 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3450075 3454413 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3467217 3469761 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3470012 3472848 He's fucked.
3473432 3476977 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3477227 3479354 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3479605 3480898 That's a relief.
3481148 3483775 - I'll have to get help.<br />- No way!
3484026 3486987 Why?
3487279 3489740 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3489990 3493785 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3494036 3496663 Bomb Squad?
3501001 3504588 Okay, call them in.
3506006 3510469 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3514097 3516767 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3517017 3520145 Sure. Trust me.
3535828 3537037 Excuse me, please.
3537287 3539373 Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3539623 3543377 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3543627 3547005 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3547256 3552469 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3553887 3555472 I was wrong.
3555722 3558809 Excuse me.
3560853 3565482 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3569903 3571905 Split.
3572156 3574783 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3575033 3578620 It's ready to come out.
3579246 3582791 I gotta live in this house!
3583458 3586044 Clear this room.
3586420 3589506 Come on, Riggs.
3591884 3595220 - You too, Riggs.<br />- No.
3595262 3598682 Riggs. Out.
3604480 3607483 All right.
3608275 3610194 Dive into the tub.
3610444 3613572 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3613822 3617784 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3618035 3619119 I can't do it.
3619369 3622414 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.
3622664 3624500 He can't even walk.
3624750 3627294 I'll have to help him.
3627544 3630422 All right, you better wear this.
3630672 3634218 - How's the nitrogen?<br />- Almost there.
3636428 3640015 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3640265 3643018 ...to give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3643268 3646313 - Got that?<br />- A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3646563 3647606 Lights out!
3647856 3650984 Get him up and out.
3653195 3656406 - Let's go.<br />- Move!
3657825 3659660 Good luck.
3659910 3661245 You got a piece?
3661495 3663288 - A Smith & Wesson.<br />- Try this.
3663539 3667292 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3667668 3670712 Good luck.
3672673 3675676 All right, let's move.
3683475 3685936 Alone at last.
3686186 3689314 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3689565 3694486 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3706248 3708375 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3708625 3711086 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3711336 3715883 Anyway, I'm here, and I don't<br />plan on going just now.
3716633 3719553 Let's do it.
3724683 3725684 On "three".
3725934 3728520 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3728770 3731106 I'm just gonna give you the...
3731356 3735110 On "three", huh? What do you say?
3736069 3737988 One...
3738238 3741783 ...two...<br />- Wait!
3742409 3745245 Do we do it on "three"...
3745496 3747372 ...or "one, two, three"...
3747623 3749958 ...then do it?<br />- Well, it's your ass.
3750209 3752377 It's up to you.
3752628 3754129 My ass, yeah.
3754379 3755506 "Three."
3755756 3757174 We go on "three"?
3757424 3761386 "One, two" and then "three"!
3763388 3764515 One...
3764765 3767684 - Martin?<br />- What?
3772981 3775025 I know.
3775275 3778403 I mean it, man.
3779822 3782699 I hear you.
3783867 3787162 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3787412 3789289 On "three".
3789540 3791375 One...
3791625 3792835 ...two...
3793085 3795754 ...three!
3803762 3806849 I gotta go! I gotta go!
3823532 3828370 Get off me. I don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3830831 3832833 Mr. Jones?
3833083 3836545 Sit down, please.
3837713 3839715 What can I do for you today?
3839965 3842759 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3843010 3845596 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3845846 3848098 Of course, I can help him do that.
3848348 3851310 I want you to talk him out of it.
3851560 3852811 Talk him out of it?
3853061 3854771 Whatever for?
3855022 3858984 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3859234 3862154 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3862404 3864531 ...we can sit down...<br />- No, he's here.
3864781 3866074 - He's here?<br />- He's here now.
3866325 3867242 Alphonse!
3867493 3870204 Alphonse?
3876084 3877336 How you doing?
3877586 3881048 There must be some mistake.
3881924 3884718 Say what?
3885552 3889056 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3889306 3892100 I don't think you want<br />to go to South Africa.
3892351 3894978 Why not?
3896605 3899483 Because you're black.
3901068 3902444 You are.
3902694 3904279 He is.
3904530 3908075 Of course I'm black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3908325 3910619 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3910869 3913622 ...against the tyranny<br />of the racist, fascist...
3913872 3915165 ...white, minority regime!
3915415 3916458 Fascist regime!
3916708 3917751 One man, one vote!
3918001 3918919 One man, one vote!
3919169 3921380 Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!
3921630 3922881 You son of a bitch!
3923131 3927970 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />I demand that you leave.
3928512 3930764 What's happening here?
3931014 3934017 Back off!
3936145 3940190 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3951952 3954621 End apartheid now!
3954872 3959543 You're telling me to shut up?<br />You gonna arrest me?
3977811 3980647 You can't push me out!
4042835 4044545 You call this security?
4044795 4050467 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
4052094 4053929 Wait, gentlemen!
4054179 4058225 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
4058475 4061812 I should have known.
4062771 4064648 Well, well.
4064898 4068068 It's the master race!
4068318 4071572 I hope you realize the trouble<br />you are in right now.
4071822 4075325 As usual, you have everything<br />upside down and turned around...
4075576 4076910 ...and back to front.
4077161 4078871 Gentlemen...
4079121 4083125 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
4087004 4088005 Fingers off.
4088255 4090424 Hand off!
4090674 4094303 Let me look at that.
4095095 4098891 That's some piece of hardware.<br />Where the fuck do you get that stuff?
4099141 4103645 I've never seen that.<br />Where's it from? South Africa?
4104146 4106982 Don't move.
4111904 4115532 I'm surprised you haven't heard<br />about me. I got a bad reputation.
4115782 4118577 Sometimes I just go nuts.
4118827 4121622 Don't move.
4124708 4127503 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
4127753 4130380 Whatever the fuck your name is.
4130631 4135260 You fold up your tents, and get<br />the fuck out of my country...
4135511 4137721 ...and I won't do anything to you.
4137971 4139681 I'll leave you alone.
4139932 4143685 If you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
4143936 4147981 Then I'll send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
4148232 4150734 Just get out of here...
4150984 4154530 ..."kaffir" lover.
4159409 4160828 Eenie...
4161078 4162579 ...meenie...
4162830 4165374 ...minie...
4165624 4168210 Hey, Moe!
4170754 4173757 Sorry, Adolf.
4174508 4177719 Pick them up with your hands.
4177970 4179596 Big smile.
4179847 4182808 Big smile!
4183517 4185769 Vorstedt, come over here!
4186019 4188772 Vorstedt!
4191525 4194111 - Hello. Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
4194361 4195863 What are you doing here?
4196113 4199366 I've been with your boss.<br />You know, shooting the breeze.
4199616 4202786 Shooting his fish.
4213672 4216550 The guy goes, "But, but, but...
4216800 4219803 ...you're black!"
4221138 4222848 He's black!
4223098 4225976 - I bet he was shitting.<br />- Started some shit with that!
4226226 4227769 You get into Rudd's office?
4228020 4229354 Yeah, I got up there.
4229605 4232316 Aryan Crud and his<br />Brown Shirts turned up...
4232566 4234943 ...but I ripped this off a pad.<br />What's that?
4235194 4238614 - "Alba Varden, Thursday."<br />- What do you think?
4238864 4240532 Is that Hitler's girlfriend?
4240782 4241867 That's Eva Braun.
4242117 4243994 He has a date with her Thursday.
4244244 4245746 Her name sounds familiar.
4245996 4248707 - You know her?<br />- No. It just sounds familiar.
4248957 4250584 Alba Varden...
4250834 4253962 There's a deli. Pull over.<br />Let's eat, I'm starving.
4254213 4255214 I'll spring.
4255464 4258842 Let's go. Sounds good to me.
4262638 4264681 - Out the other side.<br />- Other door, Leo.
4264932 4266016 Out the other door.
4266266 4268727 No cars.
4282950 4285869 Vorstedt!
4288413 4291583 That policeman.
4301176 4302970 You should pick from the bottom.
4303220 4305097 They put the old stock on top.
4305347 4307933 Officer Riggs.
4308517 4310519 I followed you from the consulate.
4310769 4311854 You followed me?
4312104 4317693 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush too.
4318318 4320070 I wanted to apologize...
4320320 4323157 ...for the other day,<br />in case we frightened you.
4323407 4326493 I was a bit startled<br />by all those guns.
4326743 4330455 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you too.
4330706 4333834 Thank me for what?
4336920 4340174 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4340424 4344428 There's a lot I don't like<br />about my boss and my country.
4344678 4346388 But I like my job very much.
4346638 4348849 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4349099 4351727 You like this town?
4351894 4354104 That's a new one.
4354354 4357149 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4357399 4358859 Rika Van Häagen-Dazs.
4359109 4361945 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.
4362196 4365365 That's a real pretty name.
4368202 4371038 - Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?<br />- It's mine.
4371288 4372623 Shop one day at a time?
4372873 4374416 Good police work.
4374666 4376627 I get paid for that.
4376877 4378795 I don't shop for the entire week.
4379046 4380839 No? Why not?
4381089 4385469 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4385719 4388972 Wait. Have dinner with me.
4389223 4393852 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4394102 4395437 A beautiful sunset.
4395687 4399066 Come on, be original, say yes.<br />Everyone else says no.
4399316 4401568 Come to my place.<br />I'm a gourmet cook.
4401819 4403070 Let go of the basket.
4403320 4404238 I'll scream.
4404488 4405405 - Don't.<br />- I will.
4405656 4406532 Please...
4406782 4409868 I'll embarrass you.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4410118 4412454 - Come on with me.<br />- No. No, please.
4412704 4417543 Lady, let go of my bag!<br />Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!
4417793 4419336 What are you doing?
4419586 4421880 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4422130 4425133 You are a cop.
4432391 4434643 You must be an honest<br />cop, Martin Riggs.
4434893 4441400 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4442025 4444444 I did exaggerate about one thing.
4444695 4448031 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4448282 4451660 - Do you like it with or without Oreos?<br />- With, of course.
4451910 4453787 A woman after my own heart.
4454037 4456123 Careful. Watch your step.
4456373 4457416 Sam wants in.
4457666 4458667 Here, sit down.
4458917 4460586 Wait a minute.
4460836 4463922 It's a little filthy.
4472014 4474224 I haven't got wine. How about a beer?
4474475 4476351 That's fine.
4476602 4479313 She drinks beer.
4494661 4498415 What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?
4498665 4502252 Oh, it's a wedding ring.
4502503 4503962 I used to be married.
4504213 4506798 But not anymore?
4507216 4510427 No. Not anymore.
4512221 4516391 I got something on the stove.
4518352 4521230 Is Rudd hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials?
4521480 4523190 What's that?
4523440 4528070 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4528195 4531240 He's not a very nice guy.
4532115 4537454 Then whatever he's doing,<br />he shouldn't get away with it.
4544294 4545796 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4546046 4549091 - What the hell do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4549341 4551176 Easy. Easy.
4551426 4555222 Tell me, have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4555472 4558350 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4558600 4560269 No, you were a cop.
4560519 4562062 Honey, we're gonna be late.
4562312 4567943 I'm just gonna take a couple laps<br />before I go down to the station.
4620370 4625334 Sam, take a hike.<br />No "Stooges" tonight. Go on!
4626418 4629755 He's sweet.
4646230 4647231 Get a beer, man.
4647481 4648732 Don't worry about it.
4648982 4651193 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4651443 4652736 I'm out.
4652986 4656031 Put some music on.
4663497 4666917 - Who's not accounted for?<br />- Riggs and Murtaugh.
4667167 4670212 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4670462 4672548 - What about Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in.
4672798 4674758 Get on the radio and find them!
4675008 4679054 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4679304 4683517 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4683767 4686854 Sorry, captain.
4692025 4695028 Get me Riggs.
4700659 4703662 I'll get that.
4717301 4722764 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.<br />And I was feeling real lucky.
4723015 4727227 Okay. So what I see are nice<br />conservative tax returns.
4727478 4730689 Everything by the book.<br />Everything black and white.
4730939 4733484 You have to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4733734 4735694 ...if you want to see some bucks.
4735944 4739406 Your salary's not much to work with.<br />You need deductions.
4739656 4741116 - My boat.<br />- Can't deduct it.
4741366 4745454 - No, it's the bill of sale.<br />- I know, but you can't deduct it.
4745704 4747372 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4747623 4748874 - Go where?<br />- To my house.
4749124 4750834 - For what?<br />- My boat, man.
4751084 4752836 Look at this commercial!
4753086 4756173 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4756423 4758675 What are you doing?<br />Look at the girl!
4758926 4760761 You hit the button...
4761011 4764348 - I didn't hear you say that.<br />- Say what? She's great.
4764598 4769061 She has a great body.<br />Makes me want to buy rubbers.
4776735 4780781 It's time for the<br />seventh-inning stretch.
4783450 4785244 That's a baseball expression.
4785494 4787454 I know.
4787704 4791792 But we're only up<br />to the fourth inning.
4795504 4798423 Batter up!
4806223 4808308 Stay in the car.
4808559 4811228 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4811478 4814356 I don't want to stay.<br />It's cold. You have no door.
4814606 4819987 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat if you're cold.
4821405 4822823 Don't touch anything.
4823073 4826702 Nothing. I mean nothing!
4828245 4830164 Alba Varden...
4830414 4832082 Why do I know the name?
4832332 4834793 It's here. It's gotta be.
4835043 4840257 <i>- Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, what's new?</i>
4844970 4847806 The day on my boat.
4848849 4851101 Not there. Where is it?
4851351 4854396 My birthday.
4881381 4883008 I'll be damned.
4883258 4887346 "Alba Varden" is a ship, not a woman.
4887596 4890224 Leo, I told you to stay in the car.
4890474 4893060 Shit!
4894394 4898273 Son of a bitch,<br />what are you doing here?
4957249 4960294 Nailed them both.
4972347 4975392 My car.
4976685 4979605 Leo!
5036286 5037830 Get up, get dressed.
5038080 5039081 What is it?
5039331 5042626 Get dressed. Trust me.
5045379 5047047 - I don't understand.<br />- Trust me.
5047297 5049675 Something's wrong.<br />I got a bad feeling.
5049925 5053595 - I don't understand.<br />- Put this on.
5116366 5119286 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the seat.
5119536 5122414 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck.
5122664 5124666 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
5124917 5127169 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!
5127419 5130464 Stay out of the light.
5175926 5179221 Master race.
5199616 5202244 It's all right.
5205789 5208250 You shit! You shit!
5208500 5212004 - Who were those people?<br />- You tell me. Was it your husband?
5212254 5215507 What are you doing Saturday?
5224766 5227561 It's Sam!
5229521 5232858 Get your head down!
5248665 5249875 Come on, Sam!
5250125 5251627 Come on, Sam!
5251877 5253420 Come on, Sam.
5253670 5256757 - Shake a leg.<br />- Come on, boy.
5260052 5263472 Has he got any holes in him?
5264223 5267768 You clever dog!
5273440 5276151 I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.
5276401 5279154 This is the most<br />incredible first date.
5279404 5281281 Wait until the second.
5281532 5285327 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5285577 5288205 This is a nice building<br />you've got here.
5288455 5290874 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5291124 5293710 You can stay right here.
5293961 5294795 I can?
5295045 5299174 Yes, there's a vacant<br />apartment up there.
5300592 5303554 I was kidding. You can stay with me.
5303804 5304847 Tonight?
5305097 5308976 Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night<br />and the night after that.
5309226 5311103 And after that?
5311353 5314773 Don't push your luck.
5319820 5321572 I gotta go.
5321822 5325492 - But you said...<br />- Go inside and lock all the doors.
5325742 5328328 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5328579 5331707 There's better ways of staying<br />in L.A. Than that job.
5331957 5335794 All right. I've just quit.
5359276 5363572 I'll just grab a few things...<br />I forgot, I haven't got anything.
5363822 5367493 Just bring yourself.
5368535 5370204 I gotta go.
5370454 5373373 Bye.
5388138 5389389 Go home!
5389640 5392476 Go!
5404321 5407449 Go get the girl.
5427177 5430556 I was going to offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5430806 5432099 ...you're on the wagon.
5432349 5434184 That stuff will kill you quick.
5434434 5438856 You know so much about me,<br />who the hell are you?
5441733 5445195 I'm the guy that changed<br />the course of your life.
5445445 5447114 Four years ago...
5447364 5449741 ...when you was a narc<br />down at Long Beach...
5449992 5453245 ...you were getting too close.<br />We put a contract on you.
5453495 5455372 I handled it myself.
5455622 5458542 Drove your car off the road, remember?
5458792 5461753 But you weren't driving, were you?
5462004 5464673 You can't imagine the surprise.
5464923 5471388 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5471472 5474308 Your wife, right?
5475184 5478770 She didn't die straight away.
5478979 5482316 It took a bit of time.
5487779 5491533 Don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5648148 5650192 <i>She's dead. They killed her.</i>
5650442 5651693 Where are you?
5651944 5654363 They killed her. She's dead.
5654613 5656114 They killed them both.
5656365 5659952 Slow down. Who are you<br />talking about? Where are you?
5660202 5663997 <i>She's dead, Roger. She's dead.</i>
5664164 5668293 Just calm down. We'll take<br />care of it. Where are you?
5668544 5672089 I'm not a cop tonight.<br />It's personal. I'm not a cop.
5672339 5676135 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5676385 5680973 I'm gonna get those bastards<br />and fuck them! I'm going there now.
5681223 5685644 We're not going to the fucking<br />stilt house. We're under orders!
5685894 5688105 Then the stilt house will come to me.
5688355 5690816 You don't understand.<br />They killed them both.
5691066 5695070 <i>- They got Rika and my wife.<br />- Don't hang up!</i>
5699533 5702452 Shit.
5714256 5716175 What's the deal?
5716425 5719303 You talk to the feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5719553 5722181 That's not fair.
5724683 5727853 We trusted you, Leo.
5728312 5731023 You betrayed us.
5731356 5734026 You took our money!
5736403 5741366 We want it back now,<br />you slimy little shit.
5741909 5745787 Give him some more.<br />He seems to like it.
5778153 5780197 Don't try and stop me.
5780447 5783617 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5783867 5787120 They declared war on the police.
5787371 5788956 You know about that?
5789206 5791959 I heard it on the radio.
5792209 5794211 We don't have the authority.
5794461 5795671 Cavanaugh...
5795921 5799466 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
5799466 5805055 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5805305 5808350 You got a plan?
5811228 5813814 If you drive around<br />the front of the house...
5814064 5816650 ...you wait for my signal...
5816900 5819653 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5819903 5822489 They got Leo.
5823407 5826243 Be careful.
5833500 5835711 What's your signal?
5835961 5839548 You'll know it when it happens.
5840757 5844803 Somehow I think I will know.
5875918 5878796 Payday.
5891058 5894353 Feel like talking, Leo?
5897981 5900692 It's the big one!
5903737 5904780 All right. Cool it.
5905030 5908992 - Watch him.<br />- Move me away from the windows!
5940858 5941817 Watch the glass!
5942067 5944695 - Come on!<br />- I'll go.
5978604 5982441 Riggs, you crazy mother...
5997498 6000876 Holy Christ!
6003462 6004630 You all right?
6004880 6005881 I'm okay.
6006131 6008050 Thanks.
6008300 6011178 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
6011428 6013347 - I'm gonna find him.<br />- What about Leo?
6013597 6014681 What about Leo?
6014932 6016850 You're on your own now, Leo.
6017100 6018519 What do you mean?
6018769 6022189 Take my car to the station<br />and wait for the federal marshal.
6022439 6026235 It's been an experience knowing you.
6029029 6032032 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Give the little fellow a hug.
6032282 6034493 I had a lot of fun.
6034743 6036411 You do your duty now.
6036662 6038914 Don't worry.<br />I'll really get them now.
6039164 6041542 - Listen! Wait!<br />- You know how to find him.
6041792 6045420 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
6046421 6047673 Loud as you want.
6047923 6048924 Really?
6049174 6053011 - Okay. Really?<br />- Bye, Leo.
6056223 6057641 <i>Check it out.</i>
6057891 6061353 <i>The "Alba Varden" is<br />a cargo ship, not a woman.</i>
6061603 6065065 <i>The Port Authority said that<br />the "Alba Varden" arrived today...</i>
6065315 6069736 <i>... and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.</i>
6070279 6072156 This is the 11th dock.
6072406 6076952 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
6080664 6081540 The ship.
6081790 6084835 What did I tell you?
6085085 6087796 That container there,<br />with three heavy hitters.
6088046 6090716 Let's have a look.
6091008 6094887 I'll take two of them out.<br />You take one.
6095053 6100559 Better yet, you take two,<br />I'll take one. Pull over.
6146480 6147564 I can't see shit.
6147815 6149650 Me either. What is this shit?
6149900 6152986 Got a light?
6153028 6155113 It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.
6155364 6159117 I still can't see shit.
6159409 6164289 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
6167876 6171922 Holy shit. Fort Knox!
6173632 6177177 Hell, how much is it?
6177302 6180347 Thousands.
6180347 6182391 Fucking millions!
6182641 6186895 Billions!<br />A fucking Donald Trump lotto!
6195529 6197030 Look at this.
6197281 6201118 These are thousand-dollar bills.
6201285 6206540 With what I'm holding, I could put<br />all three of my kids through college.
6206790 6209376 Take it.
6215424 6216884 Fucking drug money.
6217134 6218760 Do something good with it.
6219011 6223265 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
6234276 6236069 Load the container.
6236320 6241533 Next time the sun hits their bodies,<br />they'll be in Cape Town.
6244036 6246872 - This thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
6247122 6250125 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
6250375 6251794 Let's shoot our way out.
6252044 6255589 Don't do that. I got a better idea.
6308642 6311687 Our money.
6313147 6317025 Just make sure they're dead.
6326243 6331457 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- No, you go first. I'll cover you.
6345220 6347431 - How do we get out?<br />- I'm going this way.
6347681 6351477 I'll go this way.<br />I'll check over here.
6358650 6359651 <i>Shapiro...</i>
6359902 6361570 <i>... Moss, Wyler...</i>
6361820 6364072 <i>... Cavanaugh, Friesen!</i>
6364323 6368368 <i>All of them! For Rika!</i>
6375167 6377169 Rog!
6377419 6380088 Rog!
6434560 6437229 Shit!
6564898 6568235 Riggs, you okay?
6583459 6586211 Drop it, asshole!
6590841 6595053 Diplomatic immunity!
6603770 6607900 It's just been revoked.
6684143 6687312 You're breathing. You're alive.<br />You're not dead.
6687563 6690149 No, don't die.
6690399 6693026 You're not dead until I tell you.
6693277 6697197 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6697447 6699032 You got that, Riggs?
6699283 6702161 You're not dead until I tell you.
6702411 6704413 Now breathe with me. Breathe.
6704663 6707833 - Now, breathe.<br />- Hey, Rog.
6711462 6715340 Rog, in my pocket.
6721555 6724641 I want you to throw those things away.
6724892 6729104 Those things will kill you. Really.
6733567 6736653 You son of a bitch!
6736904 6738572 I thought you were dying.
6738822 6741992 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not dying in your arms.
6742242 6745370 You son of a bitch.
6748874 6752419 Are they all gone? The bad guys?<br />Did you get them?
6752669 6756507 They been "de-kaffirnated".
6763722 6768018 Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.
6768977 6772689 Did anyone ever tell you...
6773315 6777402 ...you really are a beautiful man?
6780364 6783826 Give us a kiss before they come.
6784409 6788163 Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?
6791291 6794419 Don't make me laugh!
