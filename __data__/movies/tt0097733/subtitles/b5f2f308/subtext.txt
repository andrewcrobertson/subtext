53850 57170 ...approaching Second.<br />You're heading right for each other.
57410 59210 {y:i}- Somebody back off.<br />- Got it!
59450 62690 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
62930 67330 - You're gonna get us killed!<br />- Shit! I'm...
80410 84210 We'll stick with this red<br />son of a bitch. You chase the blue.

88130 92450 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.
92690 94410 - Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And the squad.
94650 97090 - $ 20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
97330 98890 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
99130 102090 I knew nothing about the wife's<br />station wagon. Bet's off!
102330 104810 Shut up!
112370 113610 What the hell is that?
113850 116170 What fucking language is that?
116410 117810 It's German.
118050 118930 Japanese?
119170 121970 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the LAPD.
122210 124690 They own everything.
128730 131530 Shotgun!
138650 140690 Shots are being fired.
140930 142570 Thanks for the scoop.
142810 145330 The son of a bitch shot<br />my wife's windshield.
145570 148250 Entering the pursuit.
159650 163730 Shit, man!<br />We're splitting up!
166490 170090 Son of a bitch!<br />Now we're cooking!
172570 174850 Step on it!
186010 188450 Look out!
193810 196410 See you!
215290 219450 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
233050 235370 We got one.<br />Yours is going up the hill.
235610 238330 {y:i}So is Riggs, on foot!
240530 243530 Hey, Riggs!<br />Get your slow ass in here!
243770 245490 Get in here. Now!
245730 246650 Only if I drive.
246890 248450 Move over, I'll drive.
248690 251010 No, go around. I'm driving.
251250 254050 I'll drive.
254210 256610 Did you get a make<br />on that red Beemer yet?
256850 259690 Not a scratch, you hear?
263290 264770 You're not gonna make it.
265010 266250 There's no room!
266490 268810 You're not gonna make it!
269050 272930 Look at my side panel!
281010 283490 Goddamn it, you were right, you know.
283730 287210 There wasn't enough room.
300890 304650 Get down! Get down!
304730 308090 Get down, stay down!
345650 348490 He's making a hard right.
356050 359290 Get out of the way!
372050 373730 This was a new car, Riggs.
373970 376450 It still is.
382330 383890 On three.
384130 385410 One...
385650 388650 ...two... three!
388890 391490 Shit!
391650 393690 You forgot your left indicator.
393930 396210 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
396450 399290 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamn it!
399530 400890 Me?! Where'd he go?!
401130 403690 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
403930 406730 - You come on "three"!<br />- It's "three", then go!
406970 408650 No! We always go on "three"!
408890 412770 Sometimes we go,<br />"one, two, three", then go!
413010 416650 Go check back there!
419290 421890 What was that?
422490 426170 - He's in the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
431170 433130 Holy Christ!
433370 436690 That's a lot of money.
438690 440770 What is this?
441010 442730 It's gold!
442970 444210 Fucking gold!
444450 445490 Krugerrands.
445730 448610 It's illegal. You can't<br />import this into the country.
448850 449930 You're right.
450170 453490 The damage you caused comes<br />out of the department's budget.
453730 457450 - Pay it off in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
457690 459690 You came up empty,<br />I want an explanation.
459930 463530 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said it was a routine bust.
463770 468610 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
468850 470930 This was bigger than we thought.
471170 474010 Talk to you later.
478690 482690 I worked psycho ward, Riggs.<br />You'll never get out.
482930 485210 One minute, 15 seconds.
485450 488410 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
488650 493090 What's going on here? Is this a<br />kindergarten class or a police station?
493330 495210 Let's get some work done.
495450 497970 Houdini Jr. Bets he can<br />free himself in five minutes.
498210 500610 I will too.
504170 507650 Don't try this at home, kids.
515650 517050 It's all over now.
517290 521770 Put your money on the table,<br />and get back to work.
522210 524970 Suckers!
527490 529290 Somebody check that thing, man.
529530 532970 How the hell did you do that?
533210 536650 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />I can do it whenever I want to now.
536890 538410 Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?
538650 540930 Yeah, it does.
541170 542690 But not as much as...
542930 546090 ...when I put it back in.
554770 556930 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
557170 560130 My door is always open, sergeant.
560370 564690 I think we ought to keep this<br />on a professional level, don't you?
564930 567690 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
567930 570730 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
570970 572330 And I need the money.
572570 574850 Cough up!
576010 580210 It's not all here yet.<br />I want it all. I want the lot.
585570 588010 Where did this come from?
588250 590290 You can't help yourself to this stuff.
590530 593130 This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
593370 595890 - That's mine. I won that.<br />- It's not yours.
596130 599250 You want to get busted?
599490 601370 Want to get something to eat?
601610 604490 Not tonight.<br />Rianne's commercial is on.
604730 607410 - Rianne's in a commercial?<br />- Not so loud!
607650 610930 What's the matter?<br />I'd be proud of her if I was you.
611170 614490 I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.<br />What if she stinks?
614730 616570 You gotta be kidding.<br />She'll be great!
616810 619050 Everybody, listen up!
619290 621330 Tonight at...<br />What time?
621570 622450 Come on!
622690 624450 What time?
624690 625530 8:00.
625770 628970 At 8:00 on channel...?
629810 632690 Eight. The sergeant's<br />beautiful daughter Rianne...
632930 635170 Here's her picture.
635410 640250 She'll make her television debut<br />in a commercial.
644930 649250 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
660570 664250 - Thought I'd get a new windshield.<br />- Don't worry, it'll be fine.
664490 666650 - The hood.<br />- We got a new hood on order.
666890 668890 - No bumper.<br />- We got a bumper on order.
669130 671010 See you back at your place, Rog.
671250 674410 - If you ever get there.<br />- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
674650 677170 Be careful.<br />The mirror's got tape around it.
677410 681130 Oh, boy. Shit.
692290 695530 What happened? This was a new car.<br />Mom's gonna be upset!
695770 698410 - It's still new.<br />- It's not! It's wrecked!
698650 701970 I don't want your mother to know<br />about it.
702210 703690 Do your homework too.
703930 706730 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
706970 709290 Why don't you look out for me?
709530 713690 Hey, Ricky! I want to use<br />my driveway once in a while.
713930 715650 Nice oxygen tent.
715890 719370 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
719610 723610 This is a two-car garage, and this is<br />my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.
723850 727530 I retire when I'm 52, and the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
727770 730210 Cut it out.<br />You're not retiring, are you?
730450 733330 - I've thought of it since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
733570 738330 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
739770 740770 Jesus Christ!
741010 742730 What's wrong with you guys?
742970 745010 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
745250 748010 You're sorry?<br />Check my shorts, for chrissakes!
748250 751090 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
751330 752650 Easy, easy.
752890 757210 It's no Saturday night special,<br />for crying out loud.
757450 760650 All right, give it back.
760930 762690 A man's not safe in his own home.
762930 765130 Stay the hell out of here, then.
765370 766930 You got any traffic warrants?
767170 769890 Why? Can you fix them?
775370 777530 Almost time.<br />Are we taping this?
777770 780530 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
780770 782010 Take the stairs.
782250 785290 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
785530 788330 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
788570 790130 I want my baby to look good.
790370 791090 Unplug it.
791330 792490 That's your sister!
792730 794050 Picture's perfect.
794290 796250 You think so?
796490 797610 Do I know you?
797850 798650 Yes, sir.
798890 801490 We had a long talk about a week ago.<br />Remember?
801730 803090 We did? About what?
803330 807730 - About your new hobby room.<br />- This is George!
808290 811890 - How you doing?<br />- Did you sense that I liked you?
812130 813810 Yes, sir.
814050 817450 Then sit down and be quiet.
818970 821890 - What's that you're eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
822130 823490 Tuna?!
823730 825610 Daddy, you can't eat tuna.
825850 827210 Dad killed Flipper.
827450 829050 We're boycotting tuna.
829290 833450 They kill the dolphins that get caught<br />in the nets. Only albacore.
833690 834730 Have ham.
834970 837170 Eat Miss Piggy.
837410 840930 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
844290 847530 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
848890 850930 My baby!
851170 854730 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
862010 864090 {y:i}When the time has come...
864330 867050 {y:i}... and the moment is right...
867290 868650 {y:i}... remember...
868890 871850 {y:i}... use Ramses Extra Condoms.
872090 872930 {y:i}We do!
873170 874730 {y:i}Ramses Extra.
874970 879650 {y:i}Because caring means<br />{y:i}all the protection you can get.
887130 889170 Take the kids upstairs.
889410 891130 We learn this in human development.
891370 893690 In human what?!<br />Human development what?!
893930 895530 Development. Chill out.
895770 896890 Upstairs.
897130 898890 Nick, upstairs.
899130 901210 You know how your father is.
901450 905290 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
905970 907930 Home. Out.
908170 910610 George, I got a gun.
914370 916490 What's with you?<br />She looked beautiful.
916730 921770 I liked it. She made me want<br />to buy rubbers right now.
926970 930530 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was just...
930770 933090 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
933330 935130 I think she's got a future.<br />Don't you?
935370 937970 - Yeah, she was good.<br />- George is afraid of Daddy.
938210 939490 Stick around.
939730 940970 Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.
941210 945010 Yeah, but it's an old gun,<br />and he's not a very good shot.
945250 947610 That's good.<br />I'm going anyway. Good night.
947850 950410 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- Let him buy the beer.
950650 951770 You're under 21.
952010 954450 Be back by midnight.
954690 957050 Wait and see.<br />Cops never let up, you know?
957290 960810 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />in the mail, in the coffee...
961050 965410 If you'd only shut your mouth. You<br />told everybody. I'm going for a walk.
965650 970130 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
981330 983250 How goes it with you, Hans?
983490 986330 Okay. You, Pieter?
986570 991010 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
991370 995330 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having some painting done.
995570 998450 The important thing is,<br />are you all right?
998690 1000810 No bones broken?
1001050 1002290 I'm fine, thank you.
1002530 1004690 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1004930 1006250 Yeah, that's all.
1006490 1009450 Good, good.
1011330 1015250 However, we did lose over $ 1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1015490 1018730 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1018970 1020290 It happens.
1020530 1022450 It's not your fault.
1022690 1026010 Sometimes these things<br />do not go as planned.
1026250 1031090 As you say, they just happen,<br />eh, Pieter?
1037450 1041130 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word "dropcloth".
1041370 1045610 Certain policemen in this city<br />have become an intolerable nuisance.
1045850 1050130 They are obviously onto us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1050370 1053290 Warn them off.
1053450 1055570 It's my experience...
1055810 1058730 ...that a scared cop is<br />more useful than a dead one.
1058970 1060330 A warning?
1060570 1062610 Is that not a bit tame?
1062850 1065570 Depends how you do it.
1065890 1069250 Then you'd better look at this.
1073930 1078770 This is the policeman in charge.
1079810 1082490 Goddamn "kaffir".
1082610 1084530 Lovely.
1084770 1087050 Remember to take these in order.
1087290 1090410 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1090650 1091450 Thank you.
1091690 1093610 This yours?
1093850 1096770 I found it in the wash.
1099890 1101530 Thanks.
1101770 1104090 I keep on losing this.
1104330 1105370 Something's wrong.
1105610 1110530 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1111890 1113370 What about the pen?
1113610 1116210 It just reminds me of something.
1116450 1118090 Reminds you of what?
1118330 1119890 It reminds me of...
1120130 1122810 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1123050 1125770 I didn't mean to push.
1125770 1129850 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1133170 1137370 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1137610 1140410 I had so much work.
1141250 1144530 I forgot about the whole thing.
1144690 1150290 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1150330 1154330 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1154570 1158370 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.
1162210 1166850 I should've been driving.<br />We'd have been all right.
1167690 1171450 I remember falling down on my knees,<br />and I started shaking all over.
1171690 1175210 I remember thinking,<br />"I'm just losing it".
1175450 1178930 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1179170 1183690 Lying there, and I'm seeing under<br />the couch, and I see this gold pen...
1183930 1185130 ...just lying there.
1185370 1190450 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1190650 1194170 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1194290 1198410 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1198650 1202050 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1202290 1204490 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1204730 1206610 Muscles were still working.
1206850 1209450 Then I drove to the hospital...
1209690 1212570 ...identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.
1212810 1217450 Gold pen? Trish found<br />a gold pen in the laundry.
1224970 1228370 Look around you, Sam.<br />Look around you.
1228610 1230770 One day, Sam...
1231010 1234210 ...this'll all be yours.
1236050 1239570 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1239810 1243450 A man could live here and be happy.
1246050 1249690 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?
1249930 1253130 Let's go watch some TV.
1337210 1339970 "Kaffirs!"
1341650 1344050 Wondering about your kids?
1344290 1347050 You wondering what we done to them?
1347290 1350570 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1350810 1353650 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1353890 1355810 Want to know what we done?
1356050 1358330 Shall I tell you?
1358810 1361850 You just let your imagination<br />run riot.
1362090 1364010 This has just been a warning.
1364250 1367850 After this, it gets bloody.<br />You tell your people to back off.
1368090 1370130 Don't be a smart "kaffir".
1370370 1374530 Maybe we let you live, huh?<br />Come on, let's go.
1392090 1394930 - You didn't see a face?<br />- Not one. They all had on hoods.
1395170 1396330 What about a voice?
1396570 1400930 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1401170 1402730 Not German, not English.
1402970 1405650 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1405890 1409250 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1409490 1411970 Yeah, kind of like that.
1412210 1413530 Trish and the kids?
1413770 1416490 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1416730 1420930 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?
1421170 1423050 Forensics get back with anything?
1423290 1425410 Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.
1425650 1428810 The point being, we gotta watch<br />each other's backs and fronts.
1429050 1432730 You're all invited to watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1432970 1437330 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1441210 1443730 I got something special for you boys.
1443970 1446770 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1447010 1450690 You guys are gonna babysit him<br />until Washington sends the feds.
1450930 1453890 - How long?<br />- Soon as the red tape is processed.
1454130 1455370 Three days.
1455610 1459530 This guy Getz is gonna testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1459770 1462090 Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.
1462330 1465650 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1465690 1467370 This is not a shit assignment.
1467610 1469530 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1469770 1471570 - It isn't.<br />- It's a shit assignment.
1471810 1473250 Shut up, the both of you.
1473490 1474490 Here you go, sir.
1474730 1477010 - I guaranteed this guy's safety.<br />- Why us?
1477250 1480450 Because you two are<br />the most qualified for the job.
1480690 1483410 And after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1483650 1485850 I can handle last night.
1486090 1487290 What do we do with him?
1487530 1489690 How should I know?<br />Take him to Disneyland.
1489930 1491610 This stinks. This stinks.
1491850 1492970 I don't give a fuck.
1493210 1496210 I don't have an ulcer,<br />because I know when to say that.
1496450 1498770 Here's where he's staying.<br />It's a nice hotel.
1499010 1503130 Expenses are paid by the Justice<br />Department, so enjoy yourselves.
1503370 1506210 One more thing.
1507610 1508650 Know what that says?
1508890 1512970 Same thing as that.<br />But I don't give a fuck.
1515290 1519530 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1530490 1533090 What a joint!
1533330 1536610 Excuse me, ma'am, where's the lobby?
1536850 1538610 That's this way.
1538850 1541130 Hey, come on. Come on.
1541370 1544050 What I wouldn't pay to have this pool<br />in my back yard.
1544290 1545130 You can't swim.
1545370 1548570 I could get my stroke down.
1548970 1550730 - What's the water like?<br />- Great.
1550970 1553690 - How's the temperature?<br />- Great. Why don't you come in?
1553930 1558330 As an employee, I can't get into these<br />things. If I get caught, I get fired.
1558570 1560730 Everything okay for you at the hotel?
1560970 1562970 No problem?<br />Nothing I can do for you?
1563210 1566250 Excuse me. I see you're coming out<br />of your shell.
1566490 1568370 - Hotel psychiatrist.<br />- Join us also.
1568610 1572130 Our patient, Mr. Getz, is waiting<br />for us upstairs.
1572370 1573650 Want to talk to Mr. Murphy?
1573890 1576490 Yeah, I gotta go to work. Bye.
1576730 1578450 - Come back.<br />- We'll be waiting.
1578690 1582250 Can any of you cook?
1582490 1584130 Let's go. Murphy.
1584370 1587410 The girls in this place.<br />This is where they live in the day.
1587650 1589890 This is where my tax money goes too.
1590130 1591570 Leo lives like this.
1591810 1593490 Where's the elevator?
1593730 1595450 Down the hall to the right.
1595690 1599570 Are you gentlemen guests of the hotel?
1602650 1604050 Excuse me.
1604290 1605890 What room is that for?
1606130 1608490 612.
1609770 1612970 This is it. 612.
1614010 1615770 - Who is it?<br />- Police.
1616010 1617330 How do I know that?
1617570 1622370 After I shoot you through the door,<br />you can examine the bullet.
1622690 1624730 Don't you want to see a badge?
1624970 1626290 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1626530 1628930 I get it.<br />Bad cop, good cop.
1629170 1631450 Shut up!
1631690 1633810 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1634050 1636890 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1637130 1640730 Whatever you need, Leo gets.<br />You get it?
1640970 1643690 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1643930 1645810 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.<br />This is Sgt. Riggs.
1646050 1649130 How you doing? Nice to meet you.<br />What do I call you guys?
1649370 1654010 - Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.<br />- We're gonna be your shadow.
1654650 1657690 That's all right.<br />An old-fashioned...!
1657930 1660810 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1661050 1663730 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1663970 1666890 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1667130 1668210 Yep, a Beretta.
1668450 1670250 Don't touch it.
1670490 1672650 You sure you guys are cops?
1672890 1677930 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm the state's star witness.
1677930 1680090 We'll take that room.
1680330 1685610 Actually, I already have my stuff<br />in this room. You know, when I...
1690090 1691810 It's yours. My stuff's gone.
1692050 1694370 I'll move it in the small room, okay?
1694610 1697890 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1698130 1702770 Come on, loosen up a little, guys.<br />We'll be together a long time.
1703010 1704770 I'll get it.
1705010 1707210 It's only room service.
1707450 1709930 You hungry? I'll call<br />and get anything you want.
1710170 1712530 See this silk robe?<br />Silk pajamas? Free!
1712770 1714290 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is!
1714530 1718970 - It's taxpayers'money.<br />- Oh, God! It's the same thing.
1720970 1723930 Good morning, gentlemen.
1726170 1730290 That's my food! You guys didn't<br />want anything. Bring it here.
1730530 1732210 It's mine. Boy!
1732450 1735050 You could've had anything you wanted.
1735290 1738450 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1742810 1745810 Martin, not the window!
1747050 1749570 Shit!
1772770 1775610 Where is that son of a bitch?
1775930 1780010 Somebody stop that guy!<br />Stop him!
1780250 1783890 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1784130 1785770 Get off me!
1786010 1788450 Get off me!
1788890 1793490 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back.
1793730 1796890 Clear, move it! Get back! Police!
1797130 1797890 You all right?
1798130 1800770 I'm okay.<br />Why didn't you follow me down?
1801010 1804370 - Why didn't you?<br />- I was seven floors up!
1804610 1805610 He hit me.
1805850 1808330 Good!
1808890 1811650 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1811890 1813570 Did you witness a murder?
1813810 1817330 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1818210 1823410 All I did was, I laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1823650 1825530 Half a billion dollars?
1825770 1829250 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1829490 1832970 Could I please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1833210 1835250 Could you please shut up?
1835490 1838690 - You're supposed to take care of me.<br />- Shut up!
1838930 1842890 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1843130 1848050 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1848290 1850130 What are you doing?
1850370 1854170 Just checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1854410 1856410 Okay, I got it. Okay, here.
1856650 1860010 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1860250 1862850 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1863090 1865330 I bring it to you.
1865570 1868570 - He does.<br />- Me? I don't understand. Why me?
1868810 1869930 Who am I?
1870170 1871570 I'll tell you.
1871810 1874090 You're a courier. You work for him.
1874330 1877570 I'm the drug dealer.
1879210 1884330 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1884610 1889930 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1890170 1893370 Then I issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1893610 1896810 ...minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1897050 1898690 - You like breathing?<br />- How much?
1898930 1900370 Two percent.
1900610 1905090 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1905530 1908610 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1908850 1912250 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1912490 1913410 How's that work?
1913650 1916130 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1916370 1920090 It's your money. You don't pay<br />it back. It's yours, and it's clean!
1920330 1923610 It is now laundered.
1923850 1927490 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
1927770 1930210 This is the best part. You got it?
1930450 1933490 You take a tax deduction...
1933730 1938130 ...on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
1938370 1940690 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1940930 1941850 Cheat!
1942090 1943530 Come on.
1943770 1946250 Everybody cheats.<br />Look at the Pentagon.
1946490 1949210 So you got it?
1949650 1952810 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
1953050 1955410 I was scamming those guys for months.
1955650 1957490 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1957730 1958810 You?
1959050 1961210 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
1961450 1964530 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1964770 1968450 Who's gonna miss $ 10,000 here,<br />$ 20,000 there?
1968690 1970370 Drug dealers.
1970610 1972290 That's right. They did.
1972530 1976570 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1977570 1979450 You can give that to Nick.
1979690 1982610 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
1982850 1983810 It's small, Leroy.
1984050 1988010 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I'll buy you another shirt!
1988250 1991050 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1991290 1994890 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
1995130 2000090 - Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />- On the shelf in back of the machine.
2000330 2004130 You never met anyone except couriers?
2004210 2007050 No names.
2008690 2011690 Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br />Come to think of it...
2011930 2013050 Okay, listen.
2013290 2016970 They took me up to the hills<br />in this house with stilts on it.
2017210 2020010 And I had a job interview<br />with a guy...
2020250 2022850 ...and his name was...
2023090 2024530 ...Haynes. Hans!
2024770 2026970 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2027210 2029090 It won't do any harm to look.
2029330 2031330 - I know the address.<br />- Let's go.
2031570 2032450 We shouldn't!
2032690 2034610 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2034850 2037290 We're back, we're bad!<br />You're black, I'm mad.
2037530 2039330 This is going to be great!
2039570 2043810 If we're going,<br />shouldn't I have a gun?
2044690 2047050 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2047290 2050370 I'm sorry about that.
2056050 2059050 That's downtown L.A.<br />How'd you like to have a house here?
2059290 2062570 It'd be okay three days of the year<br />when you can actually see it.
2062810 2065810 Get a fresh breath.
2065890 2068850 It's been two hours and six places.<br />You sure of the address?
2069090 2071690 I told you I wasn't sure<br />of the exact address.
2071930 2073050 What are you sure of?
2073290 2075130 I'm sure the numbers add up to 28.
2075370 2079970 I remember because I was 28 when I<br />became a certified public accountant.
2080210 2081730 We can figure this out.
2081970 2084650 There's four numbers.<br />The first one has to be a nine.
2084890 2089370 Nine is my lucky number. I was born<br />on the ninth day of the ninth month.
2089610 2094370 - This is ridiculous.<br />- Hang on. Maybe not, maybe not.
2094730 2097690 There aren't many streets<br />in Bel Air that begin with nine...
2097930 2099850 ...with four numbers in the address.
2100090 2104330 - How many's not that many?<br />- Let's have a look.
2108010 2110730 Well, I meant more than<br />10 or 12 streets.
2110970 2113290 This is thin, Riggs.<br />This is very thin.
2113530 2115210 This is anorexic.
2115450 2118810 - Such as 739, 658.
2119050 2120490 Okay, that's it.
2120730 2122210 That's it.
2122450 2124330 Look. This is it. See?
2124570 2127410 The last three numbers have to be<br />either 739 or 658.
2127650 2130930 The first number's gotta be a 9<br />because 9 was my lucky number.
2131170 2133970 I was born on the ninth day...<br />See, that's it.
2134210 2135730 I tell you, I could do it.
2135970 2136850 Take us there.
2137090 2140970 - We need a street, that's all.<br />- Is that all?
2141010 2144050 - How's that?<br />- Good enough for me.
2144290 2146130 Leo, this is the seventh place.
2146370 2148610 - We have the numbers.<br />- And the seventh time.
2148850 2152970 - Just jumble them around.<br />- It's a lucky number.
2154850 2156570 It should be coming up soon.
2156810 2158970 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2159210 2162370 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility.
2162610 2165690 That's it! Nine. My lucky number.
2165930 2169090 Stay in the car, you hear?
2169330 2172570 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2173290 2174770 Nice car.
2175010 2176810 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2177050 2179010 You're not looking<br />at what you're doing!
2179250 2183090 I know what I'm doing. I'm towing<br />your car, not a baby carriage.
2183330 2186210 You're chipping the paint.<br />I can hear it!
2186450 2189170 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell something.
2189410 2191130 What's that? A rat?
2191370 2194650 A stinky one too.
2196530 2197690 Where you going?
2197930 2200490 I'm a peeping Tom.<br />It goes with the badge.
2200730 2203610 It's fun sometimes too.
2204050 2206370 Bingo!
2209010 2210370 Lars, look!
2210610 2213850 What the fuck?
2217130 2219170 - Where's the pool?<br />- There's no pool.
2219410 2220290 There's no pool.
2220530 2222330 This house is built on stilts.
2222570 2226130 Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.
2236050 2238850 Cuff yourselves.
2244090 2247130 Not this again.
2257330 2259490 Riggs! Where you at?
2259730 2262370 Stay where you are. Don't move.
2262610 2263810 You all right?
2264050 2266690 Move that truck.
2266850 2269330 Give me your keys!
2270210 2271890 You all right?
2272130 2273050 Where you going?
2273290 2274650 That was the hotel waiter.
2274890 2276290 Wait for me!
2276530 2277610 Get out of here!
2277850 2283090 What are you doing? You can't<br />take my truck! What's going on?
2284330 2287810 Don't worry.<br />We'll bring it right back.
2293290 2294130 Gotcha!
2294370 2296610 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2296850 2298650 Where did he go?
2298890 2300610 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2300850 2304650 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2304890 2307210 Get back! It's police business!
2307450 2311650 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2328450 2332610 Go faster! We gotta catch him<br />and your partner.
2345930 2348810 Hello, asshole!
2376050 2379690 Come on, come on. Give me that!
2393570 2396010 There they are! Hurry up!
2396250 2398010 Come on! Can't you go faster?
2398250 2401690 Will you shut the fuck up?
2407410 2409890 Look out!
2448530 2451410 Oh, shit!
2474730 2476810 Wipeout! It's all under control.
2477050 2480450 I told you to look out!
2481250 2484130 - You're too old to drive this car.<br />- Shut up!
2484370 2485250 And stay!
2485490 2488650 What do you think I am, a dog?
2500850 2503850 Hands behind your neck!
2507290 2510490 What are you doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2510730 2511770 What's going on?
2512010 2514050 Freeze, dickhead!
2514290 2516770 Get down here, dickhead.<br />It's been a bad day.
2517010 2518090 Show me your hands.
2518330 2520250 Take it easy, officer.
2520490 2524210 I'm not armed. I won't resist.
2524450 2527410 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right.
2527650 2530650 Do as I say!
2533490 2535210 Get your hands on your head.
2535450 2536930 Lace them behind your head!
2537170 2539170 You have no idea what you're doing.
2539410 2543530 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2543770 2545610 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2545850 2550850 I'm minister of diplomatic affairs<br />for the South African Consulate.
2551090 2552930 South Africa,<br />home of the Krugerrand.
2553170 2554690 Among other things.
2554930 2557530 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2557770 2561450 We have diplomatic credentials...
2561890 2564930 Keep your hands high.
2567290 2570010 Give me that.
2571730 2574410 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2574650 2577490 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2577730 2580810 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2581050 2582290 Pieter Von... Vor...
2582530 2584970 Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.
2585210 2588970 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2589210 2592130 - That's you.<br />- It's official.
2592370 2594210 They are official.
2594450 2596730 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2596970 2600330 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2600570 2604970 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2605330 2608690 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2608930 2612210 ...which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2612450 2616170 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2616410 2618970 My dear officer...
2619210 2623330 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2624930 2628290 Who is the dickhead now?
2630010 2632850 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2633090 2635050 This is South African soil.
2635290 2637850 Now get out of here.
2638090 2640610 All of you.
2643770 2646730 Come on, let's go.
2647610 2648850 Hey, man, don't do it.
2649090 2655050 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I'll make you eat this thing.
2655930 2658570 "Kaffir"!
2658930 2661570 With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2661810 2665450 - I went to school with him.<br />- Yeah, right.
2665730 2670450 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2670810 2674410 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2674610 2677450 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2677810 2679690 Don't open that.
2679930 2681410 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2681650 2685290 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2685530 2688810 Is he serious with this stuff?
2689010 2691690 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2691930 2694690 They were just leaving.
2695810 2698290 She is a consulate secretary.
2698530 2701690 Give her back the briefcase.
2703010 2705810 Give it to her.
2706530 2710610 Here. I'm sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2710810 2712290 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2712530 2715130 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2715370 2719450 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2724930 2728850 I'd start getting used to<br />that sort of view.
2736090 2738090 - It's the Triangle Trade again.<br />- The what?
2738330 2740890 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2741130 2742890 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2743130 2745130 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2745370 2748970 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2749210 2752490 ...and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2752730 2756970 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2757210 2758330 Apologize?
2758570 2760690 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2760930 2763530 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2763770 2767850 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2768090 2770210 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2770450 2771250 Yes, sir.
2771490 2776450 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2776810 2781250 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2781490 2784290 - He's alive, isn't he?<br />- It's okay. I signed a waiver.
2784530 2787810 - Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />- Usually? Usually?
2788050 2789970 They're very adamant about that.
2790210 2793250 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops. They're the best.
2793490 2795650 One time, a guy was waving a gun...
2795890 2798570 What'd he say?
2799170 2800170 What did he say?
2800410 2802610 "I don't give a fuck."<br />It's his mantra.
2802850 2806970 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2807210 2808610 It's a rubber plant!
2808850 2811570 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2811810 2812690 Go spit.
2812930 2817450 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2818530 2822490 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2836930 2839970 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2843730 2847370 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2850050 2853010 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2853250 2856130 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2856370 2858530 Why don't you explain it to me?
2858770 2863170 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2863410 2867290 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2867530 2870810 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2871050 2873170 Our consulate, its staff...
2873410 2879010 ...and particularly myself, will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2884730 2887930 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
2897330 2899170 Things are getting out of hand.
2899410 2901690 We are suffering too many losses.
2901930 2904530 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
2904770 2907050 We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
2907290 2910970 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2911210 2915290 Your warning did not work.
2921370 2923210 - Come on, Leo, let's go!<br />- I'm coming.
2923450 2925570 Come on! Move!
2925810 2927930 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2928170 2931370 - Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />- Come on, Leo.
2931610 2934650 Give me the food.
2938130 2941290 - Who ordered the super combo?<br />- Over here.
2941530 2943210 I get a steak sandwich.
2943450 2944490 Who gets Leo?
2944730 2946410 You got a big, empty house.
2946650 2948850 I got a trailer.<br />What will I do with him?
2949090 2951250 My place is too small. You take him.
2951490 2952770 I had him last night.
2953010 2955250 Excuse me, fellas!
2955490 2957650 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2957890 2961010 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
2961250 2964370 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- Where were you? I just said that!
2964610 2966810 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2967050 2968490 We're not going back. Shut up!
2968730 2971530 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
2971770 2974850 Can I give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
2975090 2978570 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2978810 2980730 You know why? Let me tell you.
2980970 2984290 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
2984530 2988330 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2988570 2990770 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
2991010 2993690 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
2993930 2995650 I'm not eating this tuna!
2995890 2998810 Shut up!
3067210 3068890 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
3069130 3072450 - Get rid of that man.<br />- Yes, sir.
3073610 3078250 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3086090 3088930 The morning faxes.
3123210 3126850 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3127090 3131330 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3140370 3141730 What are you doing?
3141970 3143810 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3144050 3146050 I like living the way I live.
3146290 3150170 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3150410 3153170 - There's a pan under there?<br />- Oh, please. Come on.
3153410 3156010 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3156250 3157770 Where's my TV?
3158010 3159810 Everything is outside.
3160050 3161570 Just stop what you're doing.
3161810 3164810 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3165050 3168210 Out, out! Oh, man!
3171650 3173410 {y:i}Riggs, it's Collins.
3173650 3176810 {y:i}- Has Murtaugh checked in with you?<br />- No, he hasn't. Why?
3177050 3180930 {y:i}I haven't heard from him.<br />{y:i}He doesn't answer his phone.
3181170 3183690 I'll be right there.
3187850 3189170 Stay in the car.
3189410 3191930 Get in there.
3196570 3197970 I'm upstairs!
3198210 3201330 Should I call 999,<br />"Officer in distress"?
3201570 3202650 I'll cover the back!
3202890 3206730 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
3221090 3223770 In here.
3236610 3239090 Good morning.
3244130 3247730 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3247970 3251370 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3251610 3256450 Just me and my new<br />"Salt Water Sportsman" magazine.
3263850 3268570 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3275530 3280170 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3280410 3284130 ...when I glanced over,<br />I saw this.
3287050 3289410 Oh, Jesus!
3289650 3290610 Is that all?
3290850 3295490 - You scared the shit out of me.<br />- Scared the shit out of you?
3295730 3297130 How long you been here?
3297370 3299090 I've been here all night.
3299330 3302050 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if I can...
3302290 3303570 Don't move.
3303810 3304930 I can't.
3305170 3308570 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3308810 3312970 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3325250 3327690 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3327930 3330650 He's fucked.
3331210 3334610 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3334850 3336890 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3337130 3338370 That's a relief.
3338610 3341130 - I'll have to get help.<br />- No way!
3341370 3344210 Why?
3344490 3346850 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3347090 3350730 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3350970 3353490 Bomb Squad?
3357650 3361090 Okay, call them in.
3362450 3366730 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3370210 3372770 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3373010 3376010 Sure. Trust me.
3391050 3392210 Excuse me, please.
3392450 3394450 Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3394690 3398290 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3398530 3401770 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3402010 3407010 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3408370 3409890 I was wrong.
3410130 3413090 Excuse me.
3415050 3419490 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3423730 3425650 Split.
3425890 3428410 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3428650 3432090 It's ready to come out.
3432690 3436090 I gotta live in this house!
3436730 3439210 Clear this room.
3439570 3442530 Come on, Riggs.
3444810 3448010 - You too, Riggs.<br />- No.
3448050 3451330 Riggs. Out.
3456890 3459770 All right.
3460530 3462370 Dive into the tub.
3462610 3465610 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3465850 3469650 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3469890 3470930 I can't do it.
3471170 3474090 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.
3474330 3476090 He can't even walk.
3476330 3478770 I'll have to help him.
3479010 3481770 All right, you better wear this.
3482010 3485410 - How's the nitrogen?<br />- Almost there.
3487530 3490970 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3491210 3493850 ...to give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3494090 3497010 - Got that?<br />- A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3497250 3498250 Lights out!
3498490 3501490 Get him up and out.
3503610 3506690 - Let's go.<br />- Move!
3508050 3509810 Good luck.
3510050 3511330 You got a piece?
3511570 3513290 - A Smith & Wesson.<br />- Try this.
3513530 3517130 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3517490 3520410 Good luck.
3522290 3525170 All right, let's move.
3532650 3535010 Alone at last.
3535250 3538250 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3538490 3543210 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3554490 3556530 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3556770 3559130 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3559370 3563730 Anyway, I'm here, and I don't<br />plan on going just now.
3564450 3567250 Let's do it.
3572170 3573130 On "three".
3573370 3575850 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3576090 3578330 I'm just gonna give you the...
3578570 3582170 On "three", huh? What do you say?
3583090 3584930 One...
3585170 3588570 ...two...<br />- Wait!
3589170 3591890 Do we do it on "three"...
3592130 3593930 ...or "one, two, three"...
3594170 3596410 ...then do it?<br />- Well, it's your ass.
3596650 3598730 It's up to you.
3598970 3600410 My ass, yeah.
3600650 3601730 "Three."
3601970 3603330 We go on "three"?
3603570 3607370 "One, two" and then "three"!
3609290 3610370 One...
3610610 3613410 - Martin?<br />- What?
3618490 3620450 I know.
3620690 3623690 I mean it, man.
3625050 3627810 I hear you.
3628930 3632090 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3632330 3634130 On "three".
3634370 3636130 One...
3636370 3637530 ...two...
3637770 3640330 ...three!
3648010 3650970 I gotta go! I gotta go!
3666970 3671610 Get off me. I don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3673970 3675890 Mr. Jones?
3676130 3679450 Sit down, please.
3680570 3682490 What can I do for you today?
3682730 3685410 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3685650 3688130 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3688370 3690530 Of course, I can help him do that.
3690770 3693610 I want you to talk him out of it.
3693850 3695050 Talk him out of it?
3695290 3696930 Whatever for?
3697170 3700970 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3701210 3704010 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3704250 3706290 ...we can sit down...<br />- No, he's here.
3706530 3707770 - He's here?<br />- He's here now.
3708010 3708890 Alphonse!
3709130 3711730 Alphonse?
3717370 3718570 How you doing?
3718810 3722130 There must be some mistake.
3722970 3725650 Say what?
3726450 3729810 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3730050 3732730 I don't think you want<br />to go to South Africa.
3732970 3735490 Why not?
3737050 3739810 Because you're black.
3741330 3742650 You are.
3742890 3744410 He is.
3744650 3748050 Of course I'm black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3748290 3750490 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3750730 3753370 ...against the tyranny<br />of the racist, fascist...
3753610 3754850 ...white, minority regime!
3755090 3756090 Fascist regime!
3756330 3757330 One man, one vote!
3757570 3758450 One man, one vote!
3758690 3760810 Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!
3761050 3762250 You son of a bitch!
3762490 3767130 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />I demand that you leave.
3767650 3769810 What's happening here?
3770050 3772930 Back off!
3774970 3778850 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3790130 3792690 End apartheid now!
3792930 3797410 You're telling me to shut up?<br />You gonna arrest me?
3814930 3817650 You can't push me out!
3877290 3878930 You call this security?
3879170 3884610 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3886170 3887930 Wait, gentlemen!
3888170 3892050 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
3892290 3895490 I should have known.
3896410 3898210 Well, well.
3898450 3901490 It's the master race!
3901730 3904850 I hope you realize the trouble<br />you are in right now.
3905090 3908450 As usual, you have everything<br />upside down and turned around...
3908690 3909970 ...and back to front.
3910210 3911850 Gentlemen...
3912090 3915930 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
3919650 3920610 Fingers off.
3920850 3922930 Hand off!
3923170 3926650 Let me look at that.
3927410 3931050 That's some piece of hardware.<br />Where the fuck do you get that stuff?
3931290 3935610 I've never seen that.<br />Where's it from? South Africa?
3936090 3938810 Don't move.
3943530 3947010 I'm surprised you haven't heard<br />about me. I got a bad reputation.
3947250 3949930 Sometimes I just go nuts.
3950170 3952850 Don't move.
3955810 3958490 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3958730 3961250 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3961490 3965930 You fold up your tents, and get<br />the fuck out of my country...
3966170 3968290 ...and I won't do anything to you.
3968530 3970170 I'll leave you alone.
3970410 3974010 If you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
3974250 3978130 Then I'll send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
3978370 3980770 Just get out of here...
3981010 3984410 ..."kaffir" lover.
3989090 3990450 Eenie...
3990690 3992130 ...meenie...
3992370 3994810 ...minie...
3995050 3997530 Hey, Moe!
3999970 4002850 Sorry, Adolf.
4003570 4006650 Pick them up with your hands.
4006890 4008450 Big smile.
4008690 4011530 Big smile!
4012210 4014370 Vorstedt, come over here!
4014610 4017250 Vorstedt!
4019890 4022370 - Hello. Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
4022610 4024050 What are you doing here?
4024290 4027410 I've been with your boss.<br />You know, shooting the breeze.
4027650 4030690 Shooting his fish.
4041130 4043890 The guy goes, "But, but, but...
4044130 4047010 ...you're black!"
4048290 4049930 He's black!
4050170 4052930 - I bet he was shitting.<br />- Started some shit with that!
4053170 4054650 You get into Rudd's office?
4054890 4056170 Yeah, I got up there.
4056410 4059010 Aryan Crud and his<br />Brown Shirts turned up...
4059250 4061530 ...but I ripped this off a pad.<br />What's that?
4061770 4065050 - "Alba Varden, Thursday."<br />- What do you think?
4065290 4066890 Is that Hitler's girlfriend?
4067130 4068170 That's Eva Braun.
4068410 4070210 He has a date with her Thursday.
4070450 4071890 Her name sounds familiar.
4072130 4074730 - You know her?<br />- No. It just sounds familiar.
4074970 4076530 Alba Varden...
4076770 4079770 There's a deli. Pull over.<br />Let's eat, I'm starving.
4080010 4080970 I'll spring.
4081210 4084450 Let's go. Sounds good to me.
4088090 4090050 - Out the other side.<br />- Other door, Leo.
4090290 4091330 Out the other door.
4091570 4093930 No cars.
4107570 4110370 Vorstedt!
4112810 4115850 That policeman.
4125050 4126770 You should pick from the bottom.
4127010 4128810 They put the old stock on top.
4129050 4131530 Officer Riggs.
4132090 4134010 I followed you from the consulate.
4134250 4135290 You followed me?
4135530 4140890 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush too.
4141490 4143170 I wanted to apologize...
4143410 4146130 ...for the other day,<br />in case we frightened you.
4146370 4149330 I was a bit startled<br />by all those guns.
4149570 4153130 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you too.
4153370 4156370 Thank me for what?
4159330 4162450 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4162690 4166530 There's a lot I don't like<br />about my boss and my country.
4166770 4168410 But I like my job very much.
4168650 4170770 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4171010 4173530 You like this town?
4173690 4175810 That's a new one.
4176050 4178730 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4178970 4180370 Rika Van H�agen-Dazs.
4180610 4183330 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.
4183570 4186610 That's a real pretty name.
4189330 4192050 - Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?<br />- It's mine.
4192290 4193570 Shop one day at a time?
4193810 4195290 Good police work.
4195530 4197410 I get paid for that.
4197650 4199490 I don't shop for the entire week.
4199730 4201450 No? Why not?
4201690 4205890 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4206130 4209250 Wait. Have dinner with me.
4209490 4213930 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4214170 4215450 A beautiful sunset.
4215690 4218930 Come on, be original, say yes.<br />Everyone else says no.
4219170 4221330 Come to my place.<br />I'm a gourmet cook.
4221570 4222770 Let go of the basket.
4223010 4223890 I'll scream.
4224130 4225010 - Don't.<br />- I will.
4225250 4226090 Please...
4226330 4229290 I'll embarrass you.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4229530 4231770 - Come on with me.<br />- No. No, please.
4232010 4236650 Lady, let go of my bag!<br />Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!
4236890 4238370 What are you doing?
4238610 4240810 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4241050 4243930 You are a cop.
4250890 4253050 You must be an honest<br />cop, Martin Riggs.
4253290 4259530 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4260130 4262450 I did exaggerate about one thing.
4262690 4265890 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4266130 4269370 - Do you like it with or without Oreos?<br />- With, of course.
4269610 4271410 A woman after my own heart.
4271650 4273650 Careful. Watch your step.
4273890 4274890 Sam wants in.
4275130 4276090 Here, sit down.
4276330 4277930 Wait a minute.
4278170 4281130 It's a little filthy.
4288890 4291010 I haven't got wine. How about a beer?
4291250 4293050 That's fine.
4293290 4295890 She drinks beer.
4310610 4314210 What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?
4314450 4317890 Oh, it's a wedding ring.
4318130 4319530 I used to be married.
4319770 4322250 But not anymore?
4322650 4325730 No. Not anymore.
4327450 4331450 I got something on the stove.
4333330 4336090 Is Rudd hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials?
4336330 4337970 What's that?
4338210 4342650 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4342770 4345690 He's not a very nice guy.
4346530 4351650 Then whatever he's doing,<br />he shouldn't get away with it.
4358210 4359650 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4359890 4362810 - What the hell do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4363050 4364810 Easy. Easy.
4365050 4368690 Tell me, have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4368930 4371690 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4371930 4373530 No, you were a cop.
4373770 4375250 Honey, we're gonna be late.
4375490 4380890 I'm just gonna take a couple laps<br />before I go down to the station.
4431170 4435930 Sam, take a hike.<br />No "Stooges" tonight. Go on!
4436970 4440170 He's sweet.
4455970 4456930 Get a beer, man.
4457170 4458370 Don't worry about it.
4458610 4460730 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4460970 4462210 I'm out.
4462450 4465370 Put some music on.
4472530 4475810 - Who's not accounted for?<br />- Riggs and Murtaugh.
4476050 4478970 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4479210 4481210 - What about Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in.
4481450 4483330 Get on the radio and find them!
4483570 4487450 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4487690 4491730 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4491970 4494930 Sorry, captain.
4499890 4502770 Get me Riggs.
4508170 4511050 I'll get that.
4524130 4529370 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.<br />And I was feeling real lucky.
4529610 4533650 Okay. So what I see are nice<br />conservative tax returns.
4533890 4536970 Everything by the book.<br />Everything black and white.
4537210 4539650 You have to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4539890 4541770 ...if you want to see some bucks.
4542010 4545330 Your salary's not much to work with.<br />You need deductions.
4545570 4546970 - My boat.<br />- Can't deduct it.
4547210 4551130 - No, it's the bill of sale.<br />- I know, but you can't deduct it.
4551370 4552970 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4553210 4554410 - Go where?<br />- To my house.
4554650 4556290 - For what?<br />- My boat, man.
4556530 4558210 Look at this commercial!
4558450 4561410 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4561650 4563810 What are you doing?<br />Look at the girl!
4564050 4565810 You hit the button...
4566050 4569250 - I didn't hear you say that.<br />- Say what? She's great.
4569490 4573770 She has a great body.<br />Makes me want to buy rubbers.
4581130 4585010 It's time for the<br />seventh-inning stretch.
4587570 4589290 That's a baseball expression.
4589530 4591410 I know.
4591650 4595570 But we're only up<br />to the fourth inning.
4599130 4601930 Batter up!
4609410 4611410 Stay in the car.
4611650 4614210 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4614450 4617210 I don't want to stay.<br />It's cold. You have no door.
4617450 4622610 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat if you're cold.
4623970 4625330 Don't touch anything.
4625570 4629050 Nothing. I mean nothing!
4630530 4632370 Alba Varden...
4632610 4634210 Why do I know the name?
4634450 4636810 It's here. It's gotta be.
4637050 4642050 {y:i}- Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, what's new?
4646570 4649290 The day on my boat.
4650290 4652450 Not there. Where is it?
4652690 4655610 My birthday.
4681490 4683050 I'll be damned.
4683290 4687210 "Alba Varden" is a ship, not a woman.
4687450 4689970 Leo, I told you to stay in the car.
4690210 4692690 Shit!
4693970 4697690 Son of a bitch,<br />what are you doing here?
4754250 4757170 Nailed them both.
4768730 4771650 My car.
4772890 4775690 Leo!
4830050 4831530 Get up, get dressed.
4831770 4832730 What is it?
4832970 4836130 Get dressed. Trust me.
4838770 4840370 - I don't understand.<br />- Trust me.
4840610 4842890 Something's wrong.<br />I got a bad feeling.
4843130 4846650 - I don't understand.<br />- Put this on.
4906850 4909650 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the seat.
4909890 4912650 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck.
4912890 4914810 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
4915050 4917210 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!
4917450 4920370 Stay out of the light.
4963970 4967130 Master race.
4986690 4989210 It's all right.
4992610 4994970 You shit! You shit!
4995210 4998570 - Who were those people?<br />- You tell me. Was it your husband?
4998810 5001930 What are you doing Saturday?
5010810 5013490 It's Sam!
5015370 5018570 Get your head down!
5033730 5034890 Come on, Sam!
5035130 5036570 Come on, Sam!
5036810 5038290 Come on, Sam.
5038530 5041490 - Shake a leg.<br />- Come on, boy.
5044650 5047930 Has he got any holes in him?
5048650 5052050 You clever dog!
5057490 5060090 I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.
5060330 5062970 This is the most<br />incredible first date.
5063210 5065010 Wait until the second.
5065250 5068890 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5069130 5071650 This is a nice building<br />you've got here.
5071890 5074210 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5074450 5076930 You can stay right here.
5077170 5077970 I can?
5078210 5082170 Yes, there's a vacant<br />apartment up there.
5083530 5086370 I was kidding. You can stay with me.
5086610 5087610 Tonight?
5087850 5091570 Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night<br />and the night after that.
5091810 5093610 And after that?
5093850 5097130 Don't push your luck.
5101970 5103650 I gotta go.
5103890 5107410 - But you said...<br />- Go inside and lock all the doors.
5107650 5110130 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5110370 5113370 There's better ways of staying<br />in L.A. Than that job.
5113610 5117290 All right. I've just quit.
5139810 5143930 I'll just grab a few things...<br />I forgot, I haven't got anything.
5144170 5147690 Just bring yourself.
5148690 5150290 I gotta go.
5150530 5153330 Bye.
5167490 5168690 Go home!
5168930 5171650 Go!
5183010 5186010 Go get the girl.
5204930 5208170 I was going to offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5208410 5209650 ...you're on the wagon.
5209890 5211650 That stuff will kill you quick.
5211890 5216130 You know so much about me,<br />who the hell are you?
5218890 5222210 I'm the guy that changed<br />the course of your life.
5222450 5224050 Four years ago...
5224290 5226570 ...when you was a narc<br />down at Long Beach...
5226810 5229930 ...you were getting too close.<br />We put a contract on you.
5230170 5231970 I handled it myself.
5232210 5235010 Drove your car off the road, remember?
5235250 5238090 But you weren't driving, were you?
5238330 5240890 You can't imagine the surprise.
5241130 5247330 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5247410 5250130 Your wife, right?
5250970 5254410 She didn't die straight away.
5254610 5257810 It took a bit of time.
5263050 5266650 Don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5416167 5416600 Murtaugh
5416650 5418610 {y:i}She's dead. They killed her.
5418850 5420050 Where are you?
5420290 5422610 They killed her. She's dead.
5422850 5424290 They killed them both.
5424530 5427970 Slow down. Who are you<br />talking about? Where are you?
5428210 5431850 {y:i}She's dead, Roger. She's dead.
5432010 5435970 Just calm down. We'll take<br />care of it. Where are you?
5436210 5439610 I'm not a cop tonight.<br />It's personal. I'm not a cop.
5439850 5443490 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5443730 5448130 I'm gonna get those bastards<br />and fuck them! I'm going there now.
5448370 5452610 We're not going to the fucking<br />stilt house. We're under orders!
5452850 5454970 Then the stilt house will come to me.
5455210 5457570 You don't understand.<br />They killed them both.
5457810 5461650 - They got Rika and my wife.<br />{y:i}- Don't hang up!
5465930 5468730 Shit.
5480050 5481890 What's the deal?
5482130 5484890 You talk to the feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5485130 5487650 That's not fair.
5490050 5493090 We trusted you, Leo.
5493530 5496130 You betrayed us.
5496450 5499010 You took our money!
5501290 5506050 We want it back now,<br />you slimy little shit.
5506570 5510290 Give him some more.<br />He seems to like it.
5541330 5543290 Don't try and stop me.
5543530 5546570 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5546810 5549930 They declared war on the police.
5550170 5551690 You know about that?
5551930 5554570 I heard it on the radio.
5554810 5556730 We don't have the authority.
5556970 5558130 Cavanaugh...
5558370 5561770 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
5561770 5567130 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5567370 5570290 You got a plan?
5573050 5575530 If you drive around<br />the front of the house...
5575770 5578250 ...you wait for my signal...
5578490 5581130 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5581370 5583850 They got Leo.
5584730 5587450 Be careful.
5594410 5596530 What's your signal?
5596770 5600210 You'll know it when it happens.
5601370 5605250 Somehow I think I will know.
5635090 5637850 Payday.
5649610 5652770 Feel like talking, Leo?
5656250 5658850 It's the big one!
5661770 5662770 All right. Cool it.
5663010 5666810 - Watch him.<br />- Move me away from the windows!
5697370 5698290 Watch the glass!
5698530 5701050 - Come on!<br />- I'll go.
5733570 5737250 Riggs, you crazy mother...
5751690 5754930 Holy Christ!
5757410 5758530 You all right?
5758770 5759730 I'm okay.
5759970 5761810 Thanks.
5762050 5764810 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
5765050 5766890 - I'm gonna find him.<br />- What about Leo?
5767130 5768170 What about Leo?
5768410 5770250 You're on your own now, Leo.
5770490 5771850 What do you mean?
5772090 5775370 Take my car to the station<br />and wait for the federal marshal.
5775610 5779250 It's been an experience knowing you.
5781930 5784810 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Give the little fellow a hug.
5785050 5787170 I had a lot of fun.
5787410 5789010 You do your duty now.
5789250 5791410 Don't worry.<br />I'll really get them now.
5791650 5793930 - Listen! Wait!<br />- You know how to find him.
5794170 5797650 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5798610 5799810 Loud as you want.
5800050 5801010 Really?
5801250 5804930 - Okay. Really?<br />- Bye, Leo.
5808010 5809370 {y:i}Check it out.
5809610 5812930 {y:i}The "Alba Varden" is<br />{y:i}a cargo ship, not a woman.
5813170 5816490 {y:i}The Port Authority said that<br />{y:i}the "Alba Varden" arrived today...
5816730 5820970 {y:i}... and heads out tomorrow<br />{y:i}to South Africa.
5821490 5823290 This is the 11th dock.
5823530 5827890 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
5831450 5832290 The ship.
5832530 5835450 What did I tell you?
5835690 5838290 That container there,<br />with three heavy hitters.
5838530 5841090 Let's have a look.
5841370 5845090 I'll take two of them out.<br />You take one.
5845250 5850530 Better yet, you take two,<br />I'll take one. Pull over.
5894570 5895610 I can't see shit.
5895850 5897610 Me either. What is this shit?
5897850 5900810 Got a light?
5900850 5902850 It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.
5903090 5906690 I still can't see shit.
5906970 5911650 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5915090 5918970 Holy shit. Fort Knox!
5920610 5924010 Hell, how much is it?
5924130 5927050 Thousands.
5927050 5929010 Fucking millions!
5929250 5933330 Billions!<br />A fucking Donald Trump lotto!
5941610 5943050 Look at this.
5943290 5946970 These are thousand-dollar bills.
5947130 5952170 With what I'm holding, I could put<br />all three of my kids through college.
5952410 5954890 Take it.
5960690 5962090 Fucking drug money.
5962330 5963890 Do something good with it.
5964010 5968090 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
5978290 5980010 Load the container.
5980250 5985250 Next time the sun hits their bodies,<br />they'll be in Cape Town.
5987650 5990370 - This thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
5990610 5993490 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
5993730 5995090 Let's shoot our way out.
5995330 5998730 Don't do that. I got a better idea.
6049610 6052530 Our money.
6053930 6057650 Just make sure they're dead.
6068120 6073120 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- No, you go first. I'll cover you.
6086320 6088440 - How do we get out?<br />- I'm going this way.
6088680 6092320 I'll go this way.<br />I'll check over here.
6112040 6113960 Rog!
6114200 6116760 Rog!
6171000 6173560 Shit!
6296000 6299200 Riggs, you okay?
6313800 6316440 Drop it, asshole!
6320880 6324920 Diplomatic immunity!
6333280 6337240 It's just been revoked.
6410360 6413400 You're breathing. You're alive.<br />You're not dead.
6413640 6416120 No, don't die.
6416360 6418880 You're not dead until I tell you.
6419120 6422880 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6423120 6424640 You got that, Riggs?
6424880 6427640 You're not dead until I tell you.
6427880 6429800 Now breathe with me. Breathe.
6430040 6433080 - Now, breathe.<br />- Hey, Rog.
6436560 6440280 Rog, in my pocket.
6446240 6449200 I want you to throw those things away.
6449440 6453480 Those things will kill you. Really.
6457760 6460720 You son of a bitch!
6460960 6462560 I thought you were dying.
6462800 6465840 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not dying in your arms.
6466080 6469080 You son of a bitch.
6472440 6475840 Are they all gone? The bad guys?<br />Did you get them?
6476080 6479760 They been "de-kaffirnated".
6486680 6490800 Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.
6491720 6495280 Did anyone ever tell you...
6495880 6499800 ...you really are a beautiful man?
6502640 6505960 Give us a kiss before they come.
6506520 6510120 Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?
6513120 6516120 Don't make me laugh!
