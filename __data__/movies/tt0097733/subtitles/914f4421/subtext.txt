29864 32742 I love this job!<br />Can't you go faster?
32950 34910 - Floor this thing!<br />- It's my wife's.
35119 37872 - I won't go faster.<br />- You're doing 65 now.
38080 39623 65?! Shit!
39874 42626 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
45337 48632 We're eastbound on Fourth,<br />in pursuit of a red BMW...
48841 50426 driver Caucasian, blond.
50634 52928 Plate 2-4-Adam-Henry-174.
54847 58142 You are westbound on Second.<br />20-William-12's southbound...
58350 61854 approaching Second.<br />You're heading right for each other.
62063 63981 - Somebody back off.<br />- Got it!
64190 66817 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
67818 70863 - You're gonna get us killed!<br />- Shit! I'm...
86045 90007 We'll stick with this red<br />son of a bitch. You chase the blue.
90257 93844 20-William-15, that's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
94095 98390 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.
98849 100684 - Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And the squad.
100893 103479 - $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
103687 105314 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
105564 108692 I knew nothing about the wife's<br />station wagon. Bet's off!
108901 109944 Shut up!
119370 120704 What the hell is that?
120913 123374 What fucking language is that?
123582 124750 It's German.
125251 126293 Japanese?
126460 129421 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.
129630 130673 They own everything.
136428 137805 Shotgun!
146772 148482 Shots are being fired.
149150 150776 Thanks for the scoop.
151110 153779 The son of a bitch shot<br />my wife's windshield.
153988 156448 Entering the pursuit.<br />Westbound on Third and Hill.
168669 171380 Shit, man!<br />We're splitting up!
175801 178012 Son of a bitch!<br />Now we're cooking!
181599 182975 - Damn it.<br />- Step on it!
196155 197198 Look out!
204288 205456 See you!
226685 229480 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
245204 247665 We got one.<br />Yours is going up the hill.
247873 249166 So is Riggs, on foot!
253003 256173 Hey, Riggs!<br />Get your slow ass in here!
256382 258092 Get in here. Now!
258425 259468 Only if I drive.
259635 261303 - Move over, I'll drive.<br />- Go around.
261512 263889 No, go around. I'm driving.
264181 265557 I'll drive.
267268 269728 Did you get a make<br />on that red Beemer yet?
270020 271438 Not a scratch, you hear?
276735 278237 - You're not gonna make it.<br />- I will.
278529 279863 There's no room!
280072 281615 You're not gonna make it!
282741 285244 Look at my side panel!
295212 297715 Goddamn it, you were right, you know.
298048 300134 There wasn't enough room.
315941 318319 Get down! Get down!
319945 321905 Get down, stay down!
362613 364031 He's making a hard right.
373457 375292 Get out of the way!
390140 391683 This was a new car, Riggs.
392142 393185 It still is.
400859 402027 On three.
402694 403737 One...
404321 406240 two... three!
407699 408867 Shit!
410577 412746 You forgot your left indicator.
412955 415374 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
415582 418544 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamn it!
418794 420212 Me?! Where'd he go?!
420462 423090 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
423382 426301 - You come on three!<br />- It's three, then go!
426552 428303 No! We always go on three!
428554 432391 Sometimes we go,<br />one, two, three, then go!
432850 435102 Go check back there!
439398 440566 What was that?
442734 445028 - He's in the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
451785 453370 Holy Christ!
454079 455998 That's a lot of money.
459626 461170 What is this?
462045 463672 It's gold!
464089 465424 Fucking gold!
465632 467634 - Krugerrands.<br />- It's illegal.
467801 471054 - You can't import this into the country.<br />- You're right.
471597 475100 The damage you caused comes<br />out of the department's budget.
475309 479229 - Pay it off in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
479438 481565 You came up empty,<br />I want an explanation.
481773 485527 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said it was a routine bust.
485777 490657 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
491074 493243 This was bigger than we thought.
493494 494912 Talk to you later.
501335 505339 I worked psycho ward, Riggs.<br />You'll never get out.
505756 508133 One minute, 15 seconds.
508383 510344 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
511720 516266 What's going on here? Is this a<br />kindergarten class or police station?
516600 518310 Let's get some work done.
518810 521438 Houdini Jr. bets he can<br />free himself in five minutes.
521647 522689 I will too.
527903 529988 Don't try this at home, kids.
539873 541208 It's all over now.
541583 544711 Put your money on the table,<br />and get back to work.
546713 548048 Suckers!
552219 554137 Somebody check that thing, man.
554346 556807 How the hell did you do that?
556974 557975 Well...
558183 561812 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />I can do it whenever I want to now.
562020 563564 Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?
563855 565774 Yeah, it does.
566483 568110 But not as much as...
568318 570070 when I put it back in.
580664 582583 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
583166 585794 My door is always open, sergeant.
586503 590340 I think we ought to keep this<br />on a professional level, don't you?
591258 594094 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
594386 597264 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
597556 599975 And I need the money.<br />Cough up!
602811 605647 It's not all here yet.<br />I want it all. I want the lot.
612779 614698 Where did this come from?
615574 617743 You can't help yourself to this stuff.
617951 620412 This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
620912 623540 - That's mine. I won that.<br />- It's not yours.
623790 626168 You want to get busted?
627294 629296 Want to get something to eat?
629504 632549 Not tonight.<br />Rianne's commercial is on.
632758 635594 - Rianne's in a commercial?<br />- Not so loud!
635802 638639 What's the matter?<br />I'd be proud of her if I was you.
639473 642976 I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.<br />What if she stinks?
643185 645145 You gotta be kidding.<br />She'll be great!
645354 646772 Everybody, listen up!
647939 649983 Tonight at... What time?
650150 651193 Come on!
651485 652986 What time?
653487 654529 8:00.
654696 656490 At 8:00 on channel...?
657699 658742 Eight.
658909 661953 Eight. The sergeant's<br />beautiful daughter Rianne...
662162 663872 Here's her picture.
664748 668251 She'll make her television debut<br />in a commercial.
674675 677636 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
692526 695946 What happened? This was a new car.<br />Mom's gonna be upset!
696154 698949 - It's still new.<br />- It's not! It's wrecked!
699157 701618 I don't want your mother to know<br />about it.
702869 704454 Do your homework too.
704663 707624 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
707833 710293 Why don't you look out for me?
710502 714798 Hey, Ricky! I want to use<br />my driveway once in a while.
715090 716925 Nice oxygen tent.
717134 720637 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
721012 725225 This is a two-car garage, and this is<br />my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.
725434 729312 I retire when I'm 52, and the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
729521 732107 Cut it out.<br />You're not retiring, are you?
732315 735193 - I've thought of it since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
735569 738989 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
741867 742909 Jesus Christ!
743326 745162 What's wrong with you guys?
745370 747497 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
747748 750625 You're sorry?<br />Check my shorts, for chrissakes!
750876 753628 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
754087 755505 Easy, easy.
755714 759134 It's no Saturday night special,<br />for crying out loud.
760469 762262 All right, give it back.
764097 765974 A man's not safe in his own home.
766183 768101 Stay the hell out of here then.
768727 770395 You got any traffic warrants?
770604 771897 Why? Can you fix them?
779154 781406 Almost time.<br />Are we taping this?
781656 784576 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
784785 786077 Take the stairs.
786328 789539 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
789748 792709 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
792918 794419 I want my baby to look good.
794586 795629 Unplug it.
795796 797047 That's your sister!
797255 798465 Picture's perfect.
798882 800091 - You think so?<br />- Yeah.
801176 803470 - Do I know you?<br />- Yes, sir.
803678 806431 We had a long talk about a week ago.<br />Remember?
806640 808099 We did? About what?
808308 811353 - About your new hobby room.<br />- This is George!
813480 816233 - How you doing?<br />- Did you sense that I liked you?
817484 818527 Yes, sir.
819486 821488 Then sit down and be quiet.
824616 827702 - What's that you're eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
827869 828912 Tuna?!
829579 831581 Daddy, you can't eat tuna.
831790 833250 Dad killed Flipper.
833458 835168 We're boycotting tuna.
835377 839256 They kill the dolphins that get caught<br />in the nets. Only albacore.
839965 841007 - What?<br />- Have ham.
841299 842551 Eat Miss Piggy.
843844 845971 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
851017 852853 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
855814 857023 My baby!
858191 860360 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
869494 871329 When the time has come...
871913 874124 and the moment is right...
875000 876334 remember...
876668 879254 use Ramses Extra Condoms.
879921 880964 We do!
881131 882799 Ramses Extra.
883008 886344 Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.
893810 895312 Trish.
895687 897856 Take the kids upstairs.
898064 899900 We learn this in human development.
900108 902569 In human what?!<br />Human development what?!
902777 904446 Development. Chill out.
904696 905864 Upstairs.
906114 907616 Nick, upstairs.
908199 910327 You know how your father is.
910619 913079 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
913288 915123 - George.<br />- Yes, sir?
915332 916708 Home. Out.
916917 918627 - But, sir...<br />- George, I got a gun.
918877 920921 Yes, sir.
924090 926343 What's with you?<br />She looked beautiful.
926551 930263 I liked it. She made me want<br />to buy rubbers right now.
937228 940315 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was just...
941191 943652 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
943860 945779 I think she's got a future.<br />Don't you?
945987 948657 - Yeah, she was good.<br />- George is afraid of Daddy.
948949 950075 Stick around.
950533 951868 Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.
952077 955413 Yeah, but it's an old gun,<br />and he's not a very good shot.
956289 958792 That's good.<br />I'm going anyway. Good night.
959000 961711 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- Let him buy the beer.
961920 963129 You're under 21.
963338 965090 Be back by midnight.
966132 968635 Wait and see.<br />Cops never let up, you know?
968843 972555 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />in the mail, in the coffee...
972764 977352 If you'd only shut your mouth.<br />You told everybody. I'm going for a walk.
977560 980689 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
993910 995954 How goes it with you, Hans?
996162 998623 Okay. You, Meter?
999290 1002419 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1004295 1007924 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having some painting done.
1008717 1011469 The important thing is,<br />are you all right?
1011928 1013763 No bones broken?
1014431 1015765 I'm fine, thank you.
1015932 1017642 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1018435 1019811 Yeah, that's all.
1020103 1021604 Good, good.
1025108 1027944 However, we did lose over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1029446 1032449 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1033116 1034451 It happens.
1034743 1036619 It's not your fault.
1036953 1039956 Sometimes these things<br />do not go as planned.
1040665 1044169 As you say, they just happen,<br />Pieter?
1052343 1055513 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word drop cloth.
1056473 1060477 Certain policemen in this city<br />have become an intolerable nuisance.
1061144 1065648 They are obviously onto us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1065815 1067317 Warn them off.
1069027 1070653 It's my experience...
1071488 1074574 that a scared cop is<br />more useful than a dead one.
1074824 1076201 A warning?
1076493 1078328 Is that not a bit tame?
1078828 1080163 Depends how you do it.
1081998 1084000 Then you'd better look at this.
1090381 1093885 This is the policeman in charge.
1096513 1097806 Goddamn kaffir.
1099432 1100600 Lovely.
1101684 1103311 Remember to take these in order.
1104354 1107190 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1107690 1108733 Thank you.
1108900 1110193 This yours?
1111194 1112695 I found it in the wash.
1114030 1115073 Yeah.
1117367 1118368 Thanks.
1119410 1120954 I keep on losing this.
1122080 1123206 Something's wrong.
1123414 1127043 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1129963 1131339 What about the pen?
1131756 1133716 It just reminds me of something.
1134717 1135885 Reminds you of what?
1136719 1138221 It reminds me of...
1138555 1140390 the night Vicki was killed.
1141599 1142892 I didn't mean to push.
1144435 1147147 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1152152 1156573 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1156781 1158158 I had so much work.
1160577 1162453 I forgot about the whole thing.
1164164 1168459 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1170086 1174257 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1174465 1176926 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.
1182432 1185768 I should've been driving.<br />We'd have been all right.
1188146 1192108 I remember falling down on my knees,<br />and I started shaking all over.
1192317 1195195 I remember thinking,<br />I'm just losing it.
1196279 1198907 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1200116 1203953 Lying there, and I'm seeing under<br />the couch, and I see this gold pen...
1205121 1206414 just lying there.
1206623 1210335 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1212128 1214214 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1215924 1219469 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1220470 1222847 It said... Get up! Now!
1224224 1226559 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1226809 1228686 Muscles were still working.
1228978 1231481 Then I drove to the hospital...
1231981 1234984 identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.
1235193 1238488 Gold pen? Trish found<br />a gold pen in the laundry.
1247872 1250375 Look around you, Sam.<br />Look around you.
1251668 1253503 One day, Sam...
1254170 1256005 this'll all be yours.
1259467 1262553 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1263346 1265598 A man could live here and be happy.
1269852 1273690 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?
1273898 1275692 Let's go watch some TV.
1364947 1366282 Kaffirs!
1369577 1371120 Wondering about your kids?
1372288 1374457 You wondering what we done to them?
1375458 1377960 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1379128 1381339 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1382298 1384008 Want to know what we done?
1384384 1385426 Shall I tell you?
1387470 1390139 You just let your imagination<br />run riot.
1390848 1392809 This has just been a warning.
1393142 1396896 After this, it gets bloody.<br />You tell your people to back off.
1397146 1398815 Don't be a smart kaffir.
1399482 1402318 Maybe we let you live, huh?<br />Come on, let's go.
1413830 1415915 Are you all right?
1422171 1425174 - You didn't see a face?<br />- No. They all had on hoods.
1425341 1426634 What about a voice?
1426843 1431389 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1431639 1433266 Not German, not English.
1433516 1436352 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1436519 1440022 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1440273 1442692 Yeah, kind of like that.
1443151 1444527 Trish and the kids?
1444735 1447655 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1447864 1452201 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?
1452452 1454454 Forensics get back with anything?
1454704 1456789 Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.
1457165 1460460 The point being, we gotta watch<br />each other's backs and fronts.
1460710 1464547 You're all invited to watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1464755 1467758 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1473389 1476058 I got something special for you boys.
1476225 1479228 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1479395 1483191 You guys are gonna babysit him<br />until Washington sends the feds.
1483483 1486611 - How long?<br />- Soon as the red tape is processed.
1486819 1488070 Three days.
1488404 1492492 This guy Getz is gonna testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1492742 1494911 Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.
1495411 1497288 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1498915 1500583 This is not a shit assignment.
1500917 1502919 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1503127 1505087 - It isn't.<br />- It's a shit assignment.
1505254 1506756 Shut up, the both of you.
1507006 1508090 Here you go, sir.
1508299 1510760 - I guaranteed this guy's safety.<br />- Why us?
1510927 1514263 Because you two are<br />the most qualified for the job.
1514514 1517433 And after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1517600 1518935 I can handle last night.
1520144 1521437 What do we do with him?
1521646 1523940 How should I know?<br />Take him to Disneyland.
1524148 1525942 This stinks. This stinks.
1526150 1527360 I don't give a fuck.
1527610 1530738 I don't have an ulcer,<br />because I know when to say that.
1530947 1533449 Here's where he's staying.<br />It's a nice hotel.
1533616 1536953 Expenses are paid by the Justice<br />Department, so enjoy yourselves.
1537286 1539622 And Riggs, one more thing.
1542500 1543543 Know what that says?
1543960 1546629 Same thing as that.<br />But I don't give a fuck.
1550633 1553469 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1562812 1564021 Excuse me.
1564480 1566148 What room is that for?
1566315 1567358 612.
1570194 1571988 This is it. 612.
1574657 1575992 - Who is it?<br />- Police.
1576701 1577994 How do I know that?
1578327 1581831 After I shoot you through the door,<br />you can examine the bullet.
1583666 1585835 Don't you want to see a badge?
1586043 1587503 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1587670 1590047 I get it.<br />Bad cop, good cop.
1590464 1591841 Shut up!
1593050 1595344 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1595511 1598514 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1598723 1602268 Whatever you need, Leo gets.<br />You get it?
1602727 1605521 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1605855 1607857 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.<br />This is Sgt. Riggs.
1608024 1611277 How you doing? Nice to meet you.<br />What do I call you guys?
1611527 1614780 - Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.<br />- We're gonna be your shadow.
1617033 1619035 That's all right.<br />An old-fashioned...!
1620411 1623497 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1623706 1626542 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1626709 1629795 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1630046 1631213 Yep, a Beretta.
1631380 1632632 Don't touch it.
1633549 1635051 You sure you guys are cops?
1636052 1639722 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm the state's star witness.
1641265 1643017 We'll take that room.
1643768 1647730 Actually, I already have my stuff<br />in this room. You know, when I...
1652902 1655780 Okay, okay. It's yours.<br />My stuffs gone.
1656030 1658240 I'll move it in the small room, okay?
1658658 1662119 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1662328 1665790 Come on, loosen up a little, guys.<br />We'll be together a long time.
1667416 1668417 I'll get it.
1669543 1671796 It's only room service.
1672088 1674674 You hungry? I'll call<br />and get anything you want.
1674924 1677426 See this silk robe?<br />Silk pajamas? Free!
1677593 1679261 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is!
1679428 1682556 - It's taxpayers' money.<br />- Oh, God! It's the same thing.
1686143 1687687 Good morning, gentlemen.
1691607 1695319 That's my food! You guys didn't<br />want anything. Bring it here.
1696112 1697780 It's mine. Boy!
1698114 1700449 You could've had anything you wanted.
1701117 1702827 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1708958 1710501 Martin, not the window!
1713337 1714463 Shit!
1740156 1741615 Where is that son of a bitch?
1743492 1746162 Somebody stop that guy!<br />Stop him!
1747997 1751333 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1752001 1753753 Get off me!
1754003 1755004 Get off me!
1757006 1761635 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back.
1762011 1764346 Clear, move it! Get back! Police!
1765389 1766432 You all right?
1766640 1769393 I'm okay.<br />Why didn't you follow me down?
1769643 1772021 - Why didn't you?<br />- I was seven floors up!
1773355 1774440 He hit me.
1774690 1775691 Good!
1776066 1777651 Leo.
1777860 1780738 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1780946 1782740 Did you witness a murder?
1782948 1785075 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1787536 1792166 All I did was, I laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1793209 1795211 Half a billion dollars?
1795419 1799048 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1799298 1802718 Could I please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1803219 1804887 Could you please shut up?
1805554 1808390 - You're supposed to take care of me.<br />- Shut up!
1809183 1813312 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1813562 1818275 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1818901 1820236 What are you doing?
1821070 1824573 Just checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1825282 1827201 Okay, I got it. Okay, here.
1827618 1831205 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1831413 1833999 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1834333 1835501 I bring it to you.
1836919 1839922 - He does.<br />- Me? I don't understand. Why me?
1840297 1841465 Who am I?
1841757 1843259 I'll tell you.
1843425 1845803 You're a courier. You work for him.
1846095 1847930 I'm the drug dealer.
1851141 1854937 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1856772 1861318 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1862611 1865781 Then I issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1866156 1868742 minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1869785 1871495 - You like breathing?<br />- How much?
1871745 1872872 Two percent.
1873455 1876625 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1878627 1881839 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1882047 1885634 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1885843 1886886 How's that work?
1887052 1889680 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1889889 1893809 It's your money. You don't pay it back.<br />It's yours, and it's clean!
1894018 1896270 It is now laundered.
1897688 1899982 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
1900149 1901567 Okay, okay, okay.
1901817 1903986 This is the best part. You got it?
1904570 1907364 You take a tax deduction...
1907990 1911368 on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
1912828 1915331 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1915497 1916498 Cheat!
1916707 1918042 Come on.
1918500 1921045 Everybody cheats.<br />Look at the Pentagon.
1921337 1922588 So you got it?
1924590 1927676 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
1928177 1930387 I was scamming those guys for months.
1930846 1932765 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1932932 1933974 You?
1934391 1936560 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
1936894 1940189 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1940356 1943525 Who's gonna miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1944443 1945861 Drug dealers.
1946445 1948072 That's right. They did.
1948447 1951116 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1953702 1955371 You can give that to Nick.
1955913 1959041 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
1959208 1960250 It's small, Leroy.
1960459 1964630 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I'll buy you another shirt!
1964880 1967841 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1968050 1971845 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
1972054 1976058 - Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />- On the shelf in back.
1977434 1979895 You never met anyone except couriers?
1981480 1982898 No names.
1986151 1989238 Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br />Come to think of it...
1989571 1990614 Okay, listen.
1990948 1994868 They took me up to the hills<br />in this house with stilts on it.
1995077 1997955 And I had a job interview<br />with a guy...
1998247 2000249 and his name was...
2001166 2002751 Haynes. Hans!
2002918 2005254 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2005462 2007297 It won't do any harm to look.
2007673 2009800 - I know the address.<br />- Let's go.
2009967 2011010 We shouldn't!
2011176 2013262 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2013429 2016015 We're back, we're bad!<br />You're black, I'm mad.
2016265 2018017 This is going to be great!
2018392 2021103 If we're going,<br />shouldn't I have a gun?
2021270 2022312 No!
2023689 2026191 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2026442 2028110 I'm sorry about that.
2032948 2034742 It should be coming up soon.
2034950 2037286 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2037453 2040789 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility.
2040998 2044126 That's it! Nine. My lucky number.
2044460 2046670 Stay in the car, you hear?
2048005 2049882 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2052134 2053469 Nice car.
2053969 2055888 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2056096 2058140 You're not looking<br />at what you're doing!
2058390 2062436 I know what I'm doing.<br />I'm towing your car, not a baby carriage.
2062644 2064897 You're chipping the paint.<br />I can hear it!
2065898 2068776 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell something.
2068984 2070486 What's that? A rat?
2070986 2072905 A stinky one too.
2076408 2077659 Where you going?
2077826 2080496 I'm a peeping Tom.<br />It goes with the badge.
2080788 2082206 It's fun sometimes too.
2084124 2085167 Bingo!
2089421 2090839 Lars, look!
2091048 2092925 What the fuck?
2096678 2097679 Hey! Hey!
2097846 2099848 - Where's the pool?<br />- There's no pool.
2100182 2101225 There's no pool.
2101433 2103352 This house is built on stilts.
2103519 2105687 Stilts?<br />No, I'm sure there's a pool.
2117574 2118992 Cuff yourselves.
2125999 2127584 Not this again.
2139763 2141557 Riggs! Where you at?
2142266 2144685 Stay where you are. Don't move.
2145269 2146562 You all right?
2146770 2148021 Move that truck.
2149731 2150732 Give me your keys!
2153235 2154486 You all right?
2155237 2156238 Where you going?
2156405 2157906 That was the hotel waiter.
2158073 2159116 Wait for me!
2159783 2160993 Get out of here!
2161201 2165080 What are you doing? You can't<br />take my truck! What's going on?
2167916 2170043 Don't worry.<br />We'll bring it right back.
2177217 2178260 Gotcha!
2178427 2180762 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2181013 2182264 Where did he go?
2183098 2184933 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2185142 2188562 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2189396 2191648 Get back! It's police business!
2192065 2194902 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2213962 2216757 Go faster! We gotta catch him<br />and your partner.
2232147 2233649 Hello, asshole!
2263595 2265847 Come on, come on. Give me that!
2281863 2284408 There they are! Hurry up!
2284658 2286535 Come on! Can't you go faster?
2286702 2288745 Will you shut the fuck up?
2296253 2297337 Look out!
2339171 2340589 Oh, shit!
2346720 2348263 Watch out!
2366448 2368700 Wipeout! It's all under control.
2368909 2370911 I told you to look out!
2373288 2376083 - You're too old to drive this car.<br />- Shut up!
2376458 2377501 And stay!
2377709 2379461 What do you think I am, a dog?
2393725 2395310 Hands behind your neck!
2400440 2403777 What are you doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2403985 2405153 What's going on?
2405320 2406488 Freeze, dickhead!
2407739 2410325 Get down here, dickhead.<br />It's been a bad day.
2410534 2411743 Show me your hands.
2411952 2413870 Take it easy, officer.
2414162 2417374 I'm not armed. I won't resist.
2418333 2421336 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right.
2421670 2423255 Do as I say!
2427759 2429469 Get your hands on your head.
2429803 2431346 Lace them behind your head!
2431555 2433348 You have no idea what you're doing.
2433890 2437978 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2438478 2440355 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2440647 2445152 I'm minister of diplomatic affairs<br />for the South African Consulate.
2446069 2448029 South Africa,<br />home of the Krugerrand.
2448280 2449823 Among other things.
2450073 2452868 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2453034 2455370 We have diplomatic credentials...
2457372 2458999 Keep your hands high.
2463003 2464296 Give me that.
2467591 2470427 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2470677 2473513 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2473889 2476850 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2477350 2478685 Pieter Von... Vor...
2478894 2480729 Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.
2481688 2484524 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2485859 2487819 - That's you.<br />- It's official.
2489112 2490405 They are official.
2491323 2493575 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2493909 2497454 no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2497704 2500749 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2502626 2506046 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2506421 2509883 which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2510091 2513094 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2514221 2515972 My dear officer...
2517098 2519893 you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2523104 2525065 Who is the dickhead now?
2528401 2531404 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2531613 2533657 This is South African soil.
2533907 2535659 Now get out of here.
2536785 2537911 All of you.
2539079 2540163 Okay.
2542749 2544292 Come on, let's go.
2546753 2548088 Hey, man, don't do it.
2548296 2552968 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I'll make you eat this thing.
2555428 2556638 Kaffir!
2558515 2561309 With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2561518 2563812 - I went to school with him.<br />- Yeah, right.
2565647 2568984 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2570944 2573154 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2574906 2576324 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2578201 2579286 Don't open that.
2580453 2581997 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2582205 2585917 protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2586293 2588169 Is he serious with this stuff?
2588670 2589671 Yes.
2589921 2592549 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2592966 2594301 They were just leaving.
2597012 2598847 She is a consulate secretary.
2599848 2601558 Give her back the briefcase.
2604519 2605854 Give it to her.
2608189 2610859 Here. I'm sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2611359 2612444 It's only papers...
2612652 2614195 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2614446 2617198 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2617365 2620076 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2627375 2629878 I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2639012 2641097 - It's the Triangle Trade again.<br />- The what?
2641348 2644059 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2644225 2646102 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2646353 2648480 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2648688 2652484 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2652692 2656112 and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2656363 2660784 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2661034 2662202 Apologize?
2662410 2664704 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2664913 2667624 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2667874 2672128 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2672379 2674547 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2674714 2675757 Yes, sir.
2675924 2679552 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2681429 2686101 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2686309 2689270 - He's alive, isn't he?<br />- It's okay. I signed a waiver.
2689521 2692941 - Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />- Usually? Usually?
2693149 2695235 They're very adamant about that.
2695443 2698613 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops. They're the best.
2698822 2701116 One time, a guy was waving a gun...
2701324 2702617 What'd he say?
2704786 2705829 What did he say?
2706079 2708415 I don't give a fuck.<br />It's his mantra.
2708623 2711751 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2713128 2714546 It's a rubber plant!
2714838 2717757 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2717924 2718967 Go spit.
2719134 2722303 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2724973 2727559 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2744159 2745785 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2751207 2753501 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2757839 2760967 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2761176 2764012 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2764387 2766514 Why don't you explain it to me?
2766890 2771394 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2771728 2775398 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2776024 2779110 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2779694 2781863 Our consulate, its staff...
2782197 2786493 and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2794000 2795752 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
2807138 2809057 Things are getting out of hand.
2809265 2811518 We are suffering too many losses.
2811893 2814646 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
2814896 2817273 We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
2817524 2821402 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2821569 2824280 Your warning did not work.
2832747 2834165 - Let's go!<br />- I'm coming.
2834374 2836543 Come on! Move!
2836793 2839087 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2839254 2842090 - Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />- Come on, Leo.
2842882 2844467 Give me the food.
2849681 2852725 - Who ordered the super combo?<br />- Over here.
2853226 2854936 I get a steak sandwich.
2855186 2856229 Who gets Leo?
2856563 2858314 You got a big, empty house.
2858565 2860900 I got a trailer.<br />What will I do with him?
2861109 2863403 My place is too small.<br />You take him.
2863611 2864946 I had him last night.
2865196 2866698 Excuse me, fellas!
2867782 2869951 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2870285 2873079 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
2873788 2876833 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- Where were you? I just said that!
2877292 2879627 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2879794 2881337 We're not going back. Shut up!
2881588 2884507 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
2884757 2887969 Can I give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
2888219 2891806 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2892098 2893975 You know why? Let me tell you.
2894309 2897812 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
2898021 2902025 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2902275 2904611 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
2904819 2907655 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
2907822 2909657 I'm not eating this tuna!
2909866 2911367 Shut up!
2984232 2985733 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
2986234 2988194 - Get rid of that man.<br />- Yes, sir.
2990905 2994242 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3003918 3005378 The morning faxes.
3042623 3046169 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3046669 3049589 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3057263 3059682 Leo. Leo!
3060516 3061976 What are you doing?
3062185 3064145 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3064395 3066481 I like living the way I live.
3066689 3070818 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3070985 3072653 - There's a pan under there?<br />- Oh, please. Come on.
3074155 3076908 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3077116 3078701 Where's my TV?
3078951 3080828 Everything is outside.
3081037 3082622 Just stop what you're doing.
3082914 3086042 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3086292 3088002 Out, out! Oh, man!
3091923 3092965 Hello.
3093174 3094842 Riggs, it's Collins.
3095218 3098554 - Has Murtaugh checked in with you?<br />- No, he hasn't. Why?
3098805 3102016 I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
3103059 3104185 I'll be right there.
3110024 3111442 Stay in the car.
3111651 3112693 Get in there.
3115947 3117323 Roger!
3119117 3120368 I'm upstairs!
3120827 3123037 Should I call 999,<br />Officer in distress?
3124330 3125498 I'll cover the back!
3125706 3128167 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
3142014 3143224 Rog?
3144058 3145935 - Rog?<br />- In here.
3160867 3161909 Good morning.
3168708 3172503 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3172712 3176257 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3176507 3180011 Just me and my new<br />Salt Water Sportsman magazine.
3189270 3192607 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3195276 3196736 Yeah.
3201449 3205703 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3206537 3211125 when I glanced over,<br />I saw this.
3213419 3215046 Oh, Jesus!
3216130 3217131 Is that all?
3217381 3221052 - You scared the shit out of me.<br />- Scared the shit out of you?
3222470 3223971 How long you been here?
3224138 3225890 I've been here all night.
3226224 3229060 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if I can...
3229310 3230603 Don't move.
3230895 3232063 I can't.
3232313 3235024 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3236108 3238903 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3244992 3246452 Okay, okay, okay.
3253251 3255461 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3256045 3257338 He's fucked.
3259465 3261842 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3263261 3265429 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3265638 3266847 That's a relief.
3267181 3269475 - I'll have to get help.<br />- No way!
3270059 3271477 Why?
3273312 3275564 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3276023 3279860 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3280069 3281153 Bomb Squad?
3287034 3289078 Okay, call them in.
3290204 3291831 - Martin?<br />- Yeah?
3292039 3294959 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3296502 3297712 Riggs!
3300131 3302174 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3303050 3304635 Sure. Trust me.
3321861 3323112 Excuse me, please.
3323321 3325406 Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3325656 3329410 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3329660 3333039 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3333247 3336917 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3339920 3341422 I was wrong.
3341756 3343257 Excuse me.
3345426 3346677 Riggs.
3346886 3349930 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3355978 3357730 Split.
3358272 3360733 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3361108 3363152 It's ready to come out.
3363778 3367323 Hey! Hey!<br />I gotta live in this house!
3369533 3370618 Clear this room.
3372495 3374038 Come on, Riggs.
3377958 3379794 - You too, Riggs.<br />- No.
3381337 3383255 Riggs. Out.
3390554 3392014 All right.
3392348 3393849 Sergeant.
3394350 3395643 Dive into the tub.
3396519 3399480 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3399897 3403776 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3404151 3405277 I can't do it.
3405486 3408531 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.
3408781 3410658 He can't even walk.
3410825 3412660 I'll have to help him.
3413661 3415496 All right, you better wear this.
3416789 3418791 - How's the nitrogen?<br />- Almost there.
3422503 3426173 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3426340 3429176 to give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3429343 3432054 - Got that?<br />- A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3432680 3433722 Lights out!
3433931 3435516 Get him up and out.
3439311 3440938 - Let's go.<br />- Move!
3443899 3445192 - Good luck.<br />- Baker.
3446026 3447361 You got a piece?
3447570 3449405 - A Smith & Wesson.<br />- Try this.
3449613 3451866 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3453742 3455244 Good luck.
3458747 3460207 All right, let's move.
3466630 3467965 Well...
3469550 3471135 Alone at last.
3472261 3475431 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3475639 3479059 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3492364 3494492 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3494742 3497244 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3497411 3500414 Anyway, I'm here, and I don't<br />plan on going just now.
3502750 3504084 Let's do it.
3510758 3511800 On three.
3512009 3514428 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3514887 3516889 I'm just gonna give you the...
3517431 3519642 On three, huh? What do you say?
3522144 3523312 One...
3524313 3526315 - Two...<br />- Wait!
3528484 3531111 Do we do it on three...
3531612 3533489 or one, two, three...
3533697 3536116 - Then do it?<br />- Well, it's your ass.
3536283 3537409 It's up to you.
3538702 3540037 My ass, yeah.
3540454 3541497 Three.
3541830 3543290 We go on three?
3543499 3545960 One, two and then three!
3549463 3550506 One...
3550839 3552216 - Martin?<br />- What?
3559056 3560182 I know.
3561350 3562977 I mean it, man.
3565938 3567231 I hear you.
3569984 3572319 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3573487 3574655 On three.
3575656 3576865 One...
3577700 3578742 two...
3579159 3580327 three!
3589837 3591380 I gotta go! I gotta go!
3609607 3612901 Get off me. I don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3616905 3618240 Mr. Jones?
3619199 3621076 Sit down, please.
3623787 3625873 What can I do for you today?
3626040 3628876 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3629084 3631712 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3631920 3634214 Of course, I can help him do that.
3634423 3636884 I want you to talk him out of it.
3637635 3638802 Talk him out of it?
3639136 3640596 Whatever for?
3641096 3645100 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3645309 3648270 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3648520 3650648 - we can sit down...<br />- No, he's here.
3650898 3652232 - He's here?<br />- He's here now.
3652399 3653400 Alphonse!
3653567 3654735 Alphonse?
3662159 3663452 How you doing?
3663661 3665579 There must be some mistake.
3668040 3669249 Say what?
3671627 3675130 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3675422 3678258 I don't think you want<br />to go to South Africa.
3678425 3679551 Why not?
3682680 3684056 Because you're black.
3687142 3688310 You are.
3688769 3690062 He is.
3690604 3693565 Of course I'm black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3694441 3696777 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3696944 3699780 against the tyranny<br />of the racist, fascist...
3699947 3701281 white, minority regime!
3701490 3702616 Fascist regime!
3702783 3703867 One man, one vote!
3704076 3705119 One man, one vote!
3705285 3707496 Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!
3707705 3708997 You son of a bitch!
3709206 3712501 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />I demand that you leave.
3714628 3716296 What's happening here?
3717131 3718590 Back off!
3722219 3724722 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3738026 3739653 End apartheid now!
3740988 3744116 You're telling me to shut up?<br />You gonna arrest me?
3763886 3765179 You can't push me out!
3828909 3830702 You call this security?
3830911 3834998 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3838210 3839253 Wait, gentlemen!
3840254 3843090 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
3844591 3846343 I should have known.
3848846 3850305 Well, well.
3850973 3853308 It's the master race!
3854434 3857312 I hope you realize the trouble<br />you are in right now.
3857938 3861441 As usual, you have everything<br />upside down and turned around...
3861650 3863026 and back to front.
3863277 3864653 Gentlemen...
3865237 3867656 Show Officer Riggs into the street.
3873120 3874121 Fingers off.
3874329 3875622 Hand off!
3876790 3878834 Let me look at that.
3881169 3885007 That's some piece of hardware.<br />Where the fuck do you get that stuff?
3885257 3888176 I've never seen that.<br />Where's it from? South Africa?
3890262 3891513 Don't move.
3897978 3901565 I'm surprised you haven't heard<br />about me. I got a bad reputation.
3901857 3903650 Sometimes I just go nuts.
3904902 3906153 Don't move.
3910824 3913660 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3913827 3915996 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3916705 3921043 You fold up your tents, and get<br />the fuck out of my country...
3921585 3923503 and I won't do anything to you.
3924046 3925714 I'll leave you alone.
3926006 3929217 If you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
3930010 3933055 Then I'll send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
3934348 3936516 Just get out of here...
3937059 3939061 kaffir lover.
3945525 3946693 Eenie...
3947194 3948195 meenie...
3948904 3950238 minie...
3951698 3952741 Hey, Moe!
3956870 3958330 Sorry, Adolf.
3960582 3962709 Pick them up with your hands.
3964044 3965712 Big smile.
3965921 3967381 Big smile!
3969591 3971885 Vorstedt, come over here!
3972094 3973345 Vorstedt!
3977599 3980227 - Hello. Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
3980435 3981979 What are you doing here?
3982229 3985482 I've been with your boss.<br />You know, shooting the breeze.
3985732 3987359 Shooting his fish.
3994157 3995492 Bye.
3997953 3999579 Okay, okay, okay.
3999746 4002666 The guy goes, but, but, but...
4002916 4004376 you're black!
4007254 4008672 He's black!
4009172 4012092 - I bet he was shitting.<br />- Started some shit with that!
4012300 4013927 You get into Rudd's office?
4014094 4015470 Yeah, I got up there.
4015679 4018432 Aryan Crud and his<br />Brown Shirts turned up...
4018640 4021101 but I ripped this off a pad.<br />What's that?
4021268 4024771 - Alba Varden, Thursday.<br />- What do you think?
4024938 4026648 Is that Hitler's girlfriend?
4026898 4027983 That's Eva Braun.
4028191 4030110 He has a date with her Thursday.
4030318 4031903 Her name sounds familiar.
4032112 4034781 - You know her?<br />- No. It just sounds familiar.
4035032 4036700 Alba Varden...
4036950 4039953 There's a deli. Pull over.<br />Let's eat, I'm starving.
4040287 4041329 I'll spring.
4041538 4043415 Let's go. Sounds good to me.
4048712 4050797 - Out the other side.<br />- Other door, Leo.
4051006 4052132 Out the other door.
4052299 4053300 No cars.
4069024 4070442 Vorstedt!
4074488 4076156 That policeman.
4087250 4089086 You should pick from the bottom.
4089336 4091213 They put the old stock on top.
4091463 4092506 Officer Riggs.
4094591 4096676 I followed you from the consulate.
4096843 4098011 You followed me?
4098178 4102224 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush too.
4104392 4106103 I wanted to apologize...
4106394 4109272 for the other day,<br />in case we frightened you.
4109523 4112484 I was a bit startled<br />by all those guns.
4112859 4115779 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you too.
4116780 4118365 Thank me for what?
4123036 4125872 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4126540 4129751 There's a lot I don't like<br />about my boss and my country.
4130752 4132546 But I like my job very much.
4132712 4134923 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4135215 4136258 You like this town?
4138009 4139094 That's a new one.
4140428 4143265 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4143515 4145016 Rika Van Häagen-Dazs.
4145225 4148061 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.
4148270 4149896 That's a real pretty name.
4154276 4157154 - Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?<br />- It's mine.
4157404 4158738 Shop one day at a time?
4158947 4160574 Good police work.
4160740 4162742 I get paid for that.
4162951 4164911 I don't shop for the entire week.
4165120 4166329 No? Why not?
4167164 4170041 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4171793 4174963 - Wait. Have dinner with me.<br />- No.
4175297 4179968 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4180177 4181595 A beautiful sunset.
4181761 4185182 Come on, be original, say yes.<br />Everyone else says no.
4185432 4187559 Come to my place.<br />I'm a gourmet cook.
4187934 4189186 Let go of the basket.
4189352 4190395 I'll scream.
4190562 4191605 - Don't.<br />- I will.
4191771 4192772 Please...
4192939 4195984 I'll embarrass you.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4196193 4198320 - Come on with me.<br />- No. No, please.
4198778 4202449 Lady, let go of my bag!<br />Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!
4203867 4205452 What are you doing?
4205660 4207996 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4208205 4209664 You are a cop.
4218465 4220800 You must be an honest cop,<br />Martin Riggs.
4220967 4225972 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4228141 4230602 I did exaggerate about one thing.
4230810 4234147 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4234356 4237817 - Do you like it with or without Oreos?<br />- With, of course.
4237984 4239694 A woman after my own heart.
4240153 4241696 Careful. Watch your step.
4242489 4243531 Sam wants in.
4243740 4244824 Here, sit down.
4244991 4246368 Wait a minute.
4246910 4248495 It's a little filthy.
4258129 4260340 I haven't got wine. How about a beer?
4260548 4261633 That's fine.
4262676 4263843 She drinks beer.
4280735 4284531 - What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?<br />- No.
4284739 4287075 Oh, it's a wedding ring.
4288576 4290078 I used to be married.
4290287 4291371 But not anymore?
4293290 4294958 No. Not anymore.
4298295 4300922 I got something on the stove.
4304426 4307387 Is Rudd hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials?
4307554 4308888 What's that?
4309556 4312600 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4314269 4315770 He's not a very nice guy.
4318231 4321985 Then whatever he's doing,<br />he shouldn't get away with it.
4330410 4331911 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4332120 4335206 - What the hell do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4335415 4337083 Easy. Easy.
4337500 4341296 Tell me, have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4341588 4344424 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4344716 4346092 No, you were a cop.
4346593 4348219 Honey, we're gonna be late.
4348428 4352474 I'm gonna take a couple laps<br />before I go down to the station.
4380960 4383129 Sorry.
4406486 4409864 Sam, take a hike.<br />No Stooges tonight. Go on!
4412492 4414327 He's sweet.
4432345 4433346 Get a beer, man.
4433555 4434848 Don't worry about it.
4435056 4437058 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4437517 4438685 I'm out.
4439060 4440562 Put some music on.
4449571 4453032 - Who's not accounted for?<br />- Riggs and Murtaugh.
4453241 4456369 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4456536 4458705 - What about Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in.
4458872 4460874 Get on the radio and find them!
4461082 4465211 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4465378 4469215 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4469883 4471384 Sorry, captain.
4478099 4479559 Get me Riggs.
4486733 4488234 I'll get that.
4503666 4508254 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.<br />And I was feeling real lucky.
4509214 4513468 Okay. So, what I see are nice<br />conservative tax returns.
4513676 4516888 Everything by the book.<br />Everything black and white.
4517096 4519682 You have to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4519933 4521935 if you want to see some bucks.
4522101 4525605 Your salary's not much to work with.<br />You need deductions.
4525855 4527273 - My boat.<br />- Can't deduct it.
4527565 4531444 - No, it's the bill of sale.<br />- I know, but you can't deduct it.
4531903 4533571 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4533780 4535114 - Go where?<br />- To my house.
4535281 4537075 - For what?<br />- My boat, man.
4537283 4539077 Look at this commercial!
4539285 4542413 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4542622 4544916 What are you doing?<br />Look at the girl!
4545124 4547001 You hit the button...
4547210 4550588 - I didn't hear you say that.<br />- Say what? She's great.
4550797 4553716 She has a great body.<br />Makes me want to buy rubbers.
4562934 4565436 It's time for the<br />seventh-inning stretch.
4569649 4571484 That's a baseball expression.
4571651 4573278 I know.
4573903 4576447 But we're only up<br />to the fourth inning.
4581661 4583079 Batter up!
4592422 4594048 Stay in the car.
4594757 4596843 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4597677 4600597 I don't want to stay.<br />It's cold. You have no door.
4600805 4604642 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat if you're cold.
4607604 4609063 Don't touch anything.
4609272 4611357 Nothing. I mean nothing!
4614444 4616279 Alba Varden...
4616613 4618323 Why do I know the name?
4618531 4620575 It's here. It's gotta be.
4621200 4624871 - Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, what's new?
4631169 4632462 The day on my boat.
4635048 4637050 Not there. Where is it?
4637550 4639052 My birthday.
4667580 4669207 I'll be damned.
4669415 4673586 Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.
4673753 4676005 Leo, I told you to stay in the car.
4676673 4677715 Shit!
4680593 4682929 Son of a bitch,<br />what are you doing here?
4743448 4744949 Nailed them both.
4747827 4749328 Leo!
4758504 4760006 My car.
4762842 4764260 Leo!
4822485 4824070 Get up, get dressed.
4824278 4825321 What is it?
4825530 4827281 Get dressed. Trust me.
4831577 4833287 - I don't understand.<br />- Trust me.
4833496 4835873 Something's wrong.<br />I got a bad feeling.
4836082 4838251 - I don't understand.<br />- Put this on.
4902565 4905484 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the seat.
4905735 4908654 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck.
4908863 4910907 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
4911115 4913409 I'll meet you in the truck.<br />Go on!
4913618 4915119 Stay out of the light.
4962124 4963876 Master race.
4985815 4986899 It's all right.
4991988 4994448 You shit! You shit!
4994699 4998244 - Who were those people?<br />- You tell me. Was it your husband?
4998452 5000162 What are you doing Saturday?
5010965 5012216 It's Sam!
5015720 5017513 Get your head down!
5034864 5035906 Come on, Sam!
5036282 5037783 Come on, Sam!
5038075 5039118 Come on, Sam.
5039869 5041412 - Shake a leg.<br />- Come on, boy.
5046250 5048127 Has he got any holes in him?
5050421 5052423 You clever dog!
5059638 5062391 I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.
5062600 5065394 This is the most<br />incredible first date.
5065603 5067480 Wait until the second.
5067730 5071067 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5071776 5074111 This is a nice building<br />you've got here.
5074653 5077114 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5077323 5079116 You can stay right here.
5080034 5081077 I can?
5081243 5083829 Yes, there's a vacant<br />apartment up there.
5086791 5089585 I was kidding.<br />You can stay with me.
5090002 5091087 Tonight?
5091295 5095091 Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night<br />and the night after that.
5095257 5096300 And after that?
5097551 5099428 Don't push your luck.
5106018 5107770 I gotta go.
5108020 5111690 - But you said...<br />- Go inside and lock all the doors.
5111941 5114568 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5114777 5117947 There's better ways of staying<br />in L.A. than working there.
5118155 5120449 All right. I've just quit.
5145474 5149812 I'll just grab a few things...<br />I forgot, I haven't got anything.
5150020 5152148 Just bring yourself.
5154733 5156235 I gotta go.
5156652 5158028 Bye.
5158529 5161574 - Bye. Bye. Bye.<br />- Bye. Bye.
5173085 5174128 Bye.
5174336 5175546 Go home!
5175838 5177131 Go!
5190519 5192104 Go get the girl.
5213375 5216795 I was going to offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5216962 5218297 you're on the wagon.
5218547 5220424 That stuff will kill you quick.
5220633 5223469 You know so much about me,<br />who the hell are you?
5227932 5230684 I'm the guy that changed<br />the course of your life.
5231644 5233312 Four years ago...
5233562 5235981 when you was a narc<br />down at Long Beach...
5236190 5239485 you were getting too close.<br />We put a contract on you.
5239693 5241570 I handled it myself.
5241820 5244406 Drove your car off the road, remember?
5244990 5247243 But you weren't driving, were you?
5248202 5250913 You can't imagine the surprise.
5251121 5256001 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5257670 5258963 Your wife, right?
5261340 5263425 She didn't die straight away.
5265177 5266971 It took a bit of time.
5273978 5276188 Don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5433846 5436432 - Murtaugh.<br />- She's dead. They killed her.
5436640 5437933 Where are you?
5438142 5440602 They killed her. She's dead.
5440811 5442354 They killed them both.
5442521 5446191 Slow down. Who are you<br />talking about? Where are you?
5446400 5448652 She's dead, Roger. She's dead.
5450362 5454116 Just calm down. We'll take<br />care of it. Where are you?
5454700 5458287 I'm not a cop tonight.<br />It's personal. I'm not a cop.
5458537 5461540 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5462541 5467212 I'm gonna get those bastards<br />and fuck them! I'm going there now.
5467421 5471884 We're not going to the fucking<br />stilt house. We're under orders!
5472050 5474344 Then the stilt house will come to me.
5474553 5477055 You don't understand.<br />They killed them both.
5477222 5479725 - They got Rika and my wife.<br />- Don't hang up!
5480309 5482728 Riggs. Riggs!
5485731 5487065 Shit.
5500454 5501580 What's the deal?
5502581 5505542 You talk to the feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5505751 5506835 That's not fair.
5510881 5512508 We trusted you, Leo.
5514510 5515677 You betrayed us.
5517554 5518680 You took our money!
5522601 5526021 We want it back now,<br />you slimy little shit.
5528106 5530442 Give him some more.<br />He seems to like it.
5564309 5566436 Don't try and stop me.
5566645 5569147 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5570065 5572818 They declared war on the police.
5573569 5575153 You know about that?
5575404 5577656 I heard it on the radio.
5578407 5580409 We don't have the authority.
5580659 5581910 Cavanaugh...
5582119 5584121 Wyler, Shapiro...
5585664 5589668 Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5591503 5593005 You got a plan?
5597426 5600053 If you drive around<br />the front of the house...
5600262 5602347 you wait for my signal...
5603098 5605851 and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5606101 5607144 They got Leo.
5609605 5610856 Be careful.
5618071 5619197 Wait.
5619698 5620699 What's your signal?
5622159 5624202 You'll know it when it happens.
5626955 5629458 Somehow I think I will know.
5662115 5663408 Payday.
5677255 5679007 Feel like talking, Leo?
5684179 5685347 It's the big one!
5689935 5691019 All right. Cool it.
5691228 5693647 - Watch him.<br />- Move me away from the windows!
5718255 5719631 Leo.
5727055 5728098 Watch the glass!
5728265 5729307 - Come on!<br />- I'll go.
5764801 5767095 Riggs, you crazy mother...
5783695 5785530 Holy Christ!
5789659 5790827 You all right?
5791036 5792120 I'm okay.
5792329 5793371 Thanks.
5794498 5796666 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
5797626 5799544 - I'm gonna find him.<br />- What about Leo?
5799795 5800879 What about Leo?
5801129 5803048 You're on your own now, Leo.
5803298 5804758 What do you mean?
5804966 5808386 Take my car to the station<br />and wait for the federal marshal.
5808637 5810889 It's been an experience knowing you.
5815227 5818230 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Give the little fellow a hug.
5818480 5820315 I had a lot of fun.
5820899 5822651 You do your duty now.
5822859 5825153 Don't worry.<br />I'll really get them now.
5825362 5827781 - Listen! Wait!<br />- You know how to find him.
5827989 5830075 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5831576 5833870 - Yeah.<br />- Loud as you want.
5834079 5835163 Really?
5835372 5837666 - Okay. Really?<br />- Bye, Leo.
5842420 5843755 Check it out.
5844089 5847592 The Alba Varden is<br />a cargo ship, not a woman.
5847801 5851304 The Port Authority said that<br />The Alba Varden arrived today...
5851513 5854391 and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.
5856434 5858395 This is the 11th dock.
5858603 5861606 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
5866862 5867863 The ship.
5868029 5869447 What did I tell you?
5871283 5874035 That container there,<br />with three heavy hitters.
5874244 5875370 Let's have a look.
5877205 5879541 I'll take two of them out.<br />You take one.
5881251 5885213 Better yet, you take two,<br />I'll take one. Pull over.
5931176 5932469 - Riggs?<br />- Yeah?
5932677 5933803 I can't see shit.
5934012 5935889 Me either. What is this shit?
5936097 5937641 Got a light?
5939184 5941353 It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.
5941519 5943772 I still can't see shit.
5945607 5948944 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5954032 5956534 Holy shit. Fort Knox!
5959829 5961831 Hell, how much is it?
5963500 5965001 Thousands.
5966544 5968505 Fucking millions!
5968838 5971549 Billions!<br />A fucking Donald Trump lotto!
5981726 5982727 Look at this.
5983478 5985730 These are thousand-dollar bills.
5987482 5991653 With what I'm holding, I could put<br />all three of my kids through college.
5992988 5994030 Take it.
6001579 6003081 Fucking drug money.
6003331 6005000 Do something good with it.
6005208 6007919 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
6020473 6022267 Load the container.
6022517 6026187 Next time the sun hits their bodies,<br />they'll be in Cape Town.
6030233 6033069 - This thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
6033278 6036031 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
6036573 6038033 Let's shoot our way out.
6038241 6040243 Don't do that. I got a better idea.
6094839 6096341 Our money.
6099344 6101679 Just make sure they're dead.
6112440 6116111 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- No, you go first. I'll cover you.
6131376 6133670 - How do we get out?<br />- I'm going this way.
6133878 6136131 I'll go this way.<br />I'll check over here.
6144848 6145890 Shapiro...
6146099 6147475 Moss, Wyler...
6148017 6149310 Cavanaugh, Friesen!
6150520 6153022 All of them! For Rika!
6161364 6162407 Rog!
6163616 6164742 Rog!
6220757 6221883 Shit!
6348009 6350428 Riggs! Riggs!
6351095 6352889 Riggs, you okay?
6369614 6370865 Drop it, asshole!
6377038 6379707 Diplomatic immunity!
6389967 6392553 It's just been revoked.
6398309 6399644 Riggs!
6404399 6406442 - Riggs!<br />- Roger.
6409153 6410405 Roger.
6470339 6473342 You're breathing. You're alive.<br />You're not dead.
6473718 6475219 No, don't die.
6476554 6479223 You're not dead until I tell you.
6479474 6483436 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6483644 6485229 You got that, Riggs?
6485480 6488357 You're not dead until I tell you.
6488566 6490651 Now breathe with me. Breathe.
6490860 6492487 - Now, breathe.<br />- Hey, Rog.
6494238 6495740 - Rog?<br />- Yeah?
6497658 6499994 Rog, in my pocket.
6506167 6507543 Here you go, buddy.
6507752 6510880 I want you to throw those things away.
6511088 6513758 Those things will kill you.<br />Really.
6519764 6521682 You son of a bitch!
6523100 6524519 I thought you were dying.
6525019 6528231 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not dying in your arms.
6528439 6530024 You son of a bitch.
6535071 6538491 Are they all gone? The bad guys?<br />Did you get them?
6538866 6541118 They been de-kaffirnated.
6549919 6552630 Don't make me laugh!<br />Oh, Jesus.
6555132 6557301 Did anyone ever tell you...
6559512 6562056 you really are a beautiful man?
6566561 6568479 Give us a kiss before they come.
6570606 6572817 Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?
6577488 6579073 Don't make me laugh!
