1129962 1131338 What about the pen?
1131756 1133715 It just reminds me of something.
1134717 1135884 Reminds you of what?
1136719 1138220 It reminds me of...

1141599 1142891 I didn't mean to push.
1144435 1147145 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1152151 1156571 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1156781 1158156 I had so much work.
1160576 1162452 I forgot about the whole thing.
1164163 1168458 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1170086 1174256 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1174465 1176925 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.

1192316 1195193 I remember thinking,<br />"I'm just losing it."
1196279 1198905 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1200116 1203952 Lying there, and I’m seeing under<br />the couch, and l see this gold pen...
1205121 1206413 ...just lying there.
1206622 1210333 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1212128 1214212 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1215923 1219467 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1220469 1222846 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1224223 1226558 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1226809 1228685 Muscles were still working.
1228978 1231479 Then l drove to the hospital...
1231981 1234983 ...identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.

1425341 1426633 What about a voice?
1426842 1431387 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1431639 1433264 Not German, not English.
1433516 1436351 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1436519 1440021 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1440272 1442690 Yeah, kind of like that.
1443150 1444526 Trish and the kids?
1444735 1447654 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1447863 1452200 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?

1620411 1623496 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1623706 1626541 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1626709 1629794 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1630045 1631212 Yep, a Beretta.

1696111 1697779 It's mine. Boy!
1698113 1700448 You could've had anything you wanted.
1701116 1702825 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1708957 1710500 Martin, not the window!
1713337 1714462 Shit!

1777860 1780736 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1780946 1782738 Did you witness a murder?
1782948 1785074 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1787536 1792165 All I did was, l laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1793208 1795209 Half a billion dollars?
1795419 1799046 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1799298 1802717 Could l please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1803218 1804886 Could you please shut up?
1805554 1808389 -You're supposed to take care of me.<br />-Shut up!
1809183 1813311 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1813562 1818274 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1818901 1820234 What are you doing?
1821069 1824572 Just checking to see<br />if l was standing on plastic.
1825282 1827200 LEO:<br />Okay, l got it. Okay, here.
1827618 1831204 I'm who l am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.

1840297 1841464 Who am l?
1841757 1843257 I'll tell you.
1843425 1845801 You're a courier. You work for him.
1846094 1847929 I'm the drug dealer.
1851141 1854936 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1856772 1861317 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1862611 1865780 Then l issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1866156 1868741 ...minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1869785 1871494 -You like breathing?<br />-How much?
1871745 1872870 Two percent.
1873455 1876624 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1878627 1881837 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan l make to you.
1882047 1885633 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1885842 1886884 How's that work?
1887052 1889679 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1889888 1893808 It's your money. You don't pay<br />it back. It’s yours, and it's clean!
1894017 1896269 It is now laundered.
1897688 1899981 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
1900148 1901566 Okay, okay, okay.
1901817 1903985 This is the best part. You got it?
1904570 1907363 You take a tax deduction...
1907990 1911367 ...on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
1912828 1915329 -Am I a genius?<br />-You're a swindler.

1924590 1927675 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
1928176 1930386 I was scamming those guys for months.
1930846 1932763 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1932931 1933973 You?
1934391 1936559 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
1936893 1940187 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1940355 1943524 Who's gonna miss $1 0,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1944443 1945860 Drug dealers.
1946445 1948070 That's right. They did.
1948447 1951115 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1953702 1955369 You can give that to Nick.
1955912 1959040 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
1959207 1960249 It's small, Leroy.
1960459 1964629 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I’ll buy you another shirt!
1964880 1967840 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1968050 1971844 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
1972054 1976057 -Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />MURTAUGH: On the shelf in back.
1977434 1979894 You never met anyone except couriers?

2448279 2449822 Among other things.
2450073 2452866 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2453034 2455369 We have diplomatic credentials--
2457372 2458997 Keep your hands high.
2463002 2464294 Give me that.
2467590 2470425 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2470677 2473512 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2473888 2476849 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2477350 2478684 Pieter Von-- Vor--
2478893 2480727 Fuck, I’ll just call you Adolf.
2481688 2484523 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2485859 2487818 -That's you.<br />MURTAUGH: It's official.
2489112 2490404 They are official.
2491322 2493574 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2493908 2497452 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested--
2497704 2500747 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2502625 2506044 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2506421 2509882 ...which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2510091 2513093 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2514220 2515971 My dear officer...
2517098 2519892 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2523104 2525063 Who is the dickhead now?
2528401 2531403 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2531613 2533655 This is South African soil.
2533907 2535657 Now get out of here.
2536784 2537910 All of you.
2539078 2540162 Okay.
2542749 2544291 Come on, let's go.
2546753 2548086 Hey, man, don't do it.
2548296 2552966 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I’ll make you eat this thing.
2555428 2556637 <i>Kaffir!</i>
2558514 2561308 RIGGS: With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2561517 2563810 -l went to school with him.<br />-Yeah, right.
2565647 2568982 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2570944 2573153 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2574906 2576323 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2578201 2579284 Don't open that.
2580453 2581995 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2582205 2585916 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2586292 2588168 Is he serious with this stuff?
2588670 2589670 Yes.
2589921 2592547 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2592966 2594299 They were just leaving.
2597011 2598845 She is a consulate secretary.
2599847 2601556 Give her back the briefcase.
2604519 2605852 Give it to her.
2608189 2610857 Here. I’m sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2611359 2612442 It's only papers--
2612652 2614194 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2614445 2617197 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2617365 2620075 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2627375 2629876 RIGGS: I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2639012 2641096 -It’s the Triangle Trade again.<br />-The what?
2641347 2644057 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2644225 2646101 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2646352 2648478 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2648688 2652482 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2652692 2656111 ...and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2656362 2660782 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2661034 2662200 Apologize?
2662410 2664703 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2664912 2667622 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2667874 2672127 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2672378 2674546 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2674714 2675756 Yes, sir.
2675923 2679551 -Who the hell is this guy?<br />-Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2681429 2686099 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2686309 2689269 -He's alive, isn't he?<br />-It’s okay. l signed a waiver.
2689520 2692939 -Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />-Usually? Usually?
2693149 2695233 They're very adamant about that.
2695443 2698612 -l don't give a fuck.<br />-They're good cops. They're the best.
2698821 2701114 One time, a guy was waving a gun--
2701324 2702616 What'd he say?
2704786 2705827 What did he say?
2706079 2708413 "I don't give a fuck."<br />It's his mantra.
2708623 2711750 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2713127 2714544 It's a rubber plant!
2714837 2717756 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2717924 2718965 Go spit.
2719133 2722302 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2724972 2727557 COP: lf you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2744158 2745784 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2751207 2753500 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2757839 2760966 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2761175 2764010 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2764387 2766513 Why don't you explain it to me?
2766889 2771393 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2771727 2775397 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2776023 2779109 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2779694 2781862 Our consulate, its staff...
2782196 2786491 ...and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2794000 2795750 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
2807138 2809055 RUDD:<br />Things are getting out of hand.
2809265 2811516 We are suffering too many losses.
2811893 2814644 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
2814896 2817272 PIETER: We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
2817523 2821401 RUDD: I’ll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2821569 2824279 Your warning did not work.
2832747 2834164 -Let's go!<br />-I’m coming.
2834373 2836541 Come on! Move!
2836792 2839085 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2839253 2842088 -Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />MURTAUGH: Come on, Leo.
2842882 2844466 RIGGS:<br />Give me the food.
2849680 2852724 RIGGS: Who ordered the super combo?<br />MURTAUGH: Over here.
2853226 2854935 LEO:<br />I get a steak sandwich.
2855186 2856228 RIGGS:<br />Who gets Leo?
2856562 2858313 You got a big, empty house.
2858564 2860899 I got a trailer.<br />What will l do with him?
2861108 2863401 My place is too small. You take him.
2863611 2864945 I had him last night.
2865196 2866696 Excuse me, fellas!
2867782 2869950 This is tuna. l hate tuna.
2870284 2873078 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
2873788 2876831 -Don't eat the tuna.<br />-Where were you? l just said that!
2877291 2879626 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2879794 2881336 We're not going back. Shut up!
2881587 2884506 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
2884757 2887968 Can l give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
2888219 2891805 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2892098 2893974 You know why? Let me tell you.
2894308 2897811 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
2898020 2902023 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2902275 2904609 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
2904819 2907654 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
2907822 2909656 I'm not eating this tuna!
2909865 2911366 Shut up!
2984231 2985732 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
2986233 2988193 -Get rid of that man.<br />-Yes, sir.
2990905 2994240 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3003918 3005377 RIKA:<br />The morning faxes.
3042623 3046167 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3046669 3049587 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3057263 3059681 Leo. Leo!
3060516 3061975 What are you doing?
3062184 3064144 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3064395 3066479 I like living the way I live.
3066689 3070817 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3070985 3072652 -There's a pan under there?<br />-Oh, please. Come on.
3072903 3073945 [PHONE RINGS]
3074155 3076906 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3077116 3078700 Where's my TV?
3078951 3080827 Everything is outside.
3081036 3082620 Just stop what you're doing.
3082913 3086040 -Get the dog out of here!<br />-You go before the mutt.
3086292 3088001 Out, out! Oh, man!
3091922 3092964 Hello.
3093174 3094841 WOMAN:<br /><i>Riggs, it's Collins.</i>
3095217 3098553 <i>-Has Murtaugh checked in with you?</i><br />-No, he hasn't. Why?
3098804 3102015 <i>I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.</i>
3103058 3104184 I'll be right there.
3110024 3111441 Stay in the car.
3111650 3112692 Get in there.
3115946 3117322 Roger!
3119116 3120366 MURTAUGH:<br />I'm upstairs!
3120826 3123036 Should I call 999,<br />"Officer in distress"?
3124330 3125497 I'll cover the back!
3125706 3128166 -Where are you?<br />MURTAUGH: I'm up here.
3142014 3143223 Rog?
3144058 3145934 -Rog?<br />-In here.
3160866 3161908 Good morning.
3168707 3172502 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3172711 3176256 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3176507 3180009 Just me and my new<br /><i>Salt Water Sportsman</i> magazine.
3189270 3192605 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3195276 3196734 Yeah.
3201448 3205702 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3206537 3211124 ...when I glanced over,<br />I saw this.
3213419 3215044 Oh, Jesus!
3216130 3217130 Is that all?
3217381 3221050 -You scared the shit out of me.<br />-Scared the shit out of you?
3222469 3223970 How long you been here?
3224138 3225889 I've been here all night.
3226223 3229058 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if l can--
3229310 3230602 Don't move.
3230895 3232061 I can't.
3232313 3235023 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3236108 3238902 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3244992 3246451 Okay, okay, okay.
3253250 3255460 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3256045 3257337 He's fucked.
3259465 3261841 Okay, but I’d be lying.
3263260 3265428 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3265638 3266846 That's a relief.
3267181 3269474 -I’ll have to get help.<br />-No way!
3270059 3271476 Why?
3273312 3275563 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3276023 3279859 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3280069 3281152 Bomb Squad?
3287034 3289077 Okay, call them in.
3290204 3291829 -Martin?<br />-Yeah?
3292039 3294958 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3296502 3297710 Riggs!
3300130 3302173 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3303050 3304634 Sure. Trust me.
3321860 3323111 Excuse me, please.
3323320 3325405 WOODS:<br />Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3325656 3329409 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3329660 3333037 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3333247 3336916 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3339920 3341421 I was wrong.
3341755 3343256 Excuse me.
3345426 3346676 Riggs.
3346885 3349929 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3355978 3357729 Split.
3358272 3360732 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3361108 3363151 It's ready to come out.
3363777 3367321 Hey! Hey!<br />I gotta live in this house!
3369533 3370616 Clear this room.
3372494 3374037 Come on, Riggs.
3377958 3379792 -You too, Riggs.<br />-No.
3381336 3383254 Riggs. Out.
3390554 3392013 All right.
3392347 3393848 Sergeant.
3394349 3395641 Dive into the tub.
3396518 3399479 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3399897 3403775 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3404151 3405276 I can't do it.
3405486 3408529 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 1 8, 20 hours.
3408781 3410656 He can't even walk.
3410824 3412658 I'll have to help him.
3413660 3415495 All right, you better wear this.
3416789 3418790 -How's the nitrogen?<br />-Almost there.
3422503 3426172 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3426340 3429175 ...to give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3429343 3432053 -Got that?<br />-A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3432679 3433721 Lights out!
3433931 3435515 Get him up and out.
3439311 3440937 -Let's go.<br />-Move!
3443899 3445191 -Good luck.<br />-Baker.
3446026 3447360 You got a piece?
3447569 3449403 -A Smith & Wesson.<br />-Try this.
3449613 3451864 Safety's on. I’ll collect it later.
3453742 3455243 Good luck.
3458747 3460206 All right, let's move.
3466630 3467964 Well....
3469550 3471134 Alone at last.
3472261 3475429 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3475639 3479058 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3492364 3494490 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3494741 3497243 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3497411 3500413 Anyway, I'm here, and l don't<br />plan on going just now.
3502749 3504083 Let's do it.
3510757 3511799 On "three."
3512009 3514427 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3514887 3516888 I'm just gonna give you the--
3517431 3519640 On "three," huh? What do you say?
3522144 3523311 One...
3524313 3526314 -...two--<br />-Wait!
3528483 3531110 Do we do it on "three"...
3531612 3533487 ...or "one, two, three"...
3533697 3536115 -...then do it?<br />-Well, it's your ass.
3536283 3537408 It's up to you.
3538702 3540036 My ass, yeah.
3540454 3541495 "Three."
3541830 3543289 We go on "three"?
3543498 3545958 "One, two" and then "three"!
3549463 3550504 One....
3550839 3552215 -Martin?<br />-What?
3559056 3560181 I know.
3561350 3562975 I mean it, man.
3565938 3567230 I hear you.
3569983 3572318 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3573487 3574654 On "three."
3575656 3576864 One...
3577699 3578741 ...two...
3579159 3580326 ...three!
3589836 3591379 LEO:<br />I gotta go! l gotta go!
3609606 3612900 Get off me. l don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3616905 3618239 Mr. Jones?
3619199 3621075 Sit down, please.
3623787 3625871 What can I do for you today?
3626039 3628874 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3629084 3631711 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3631920 3634213 Of course, I can help him do that.
3634423 3636882 I want you to talk him out of it.
3637634 3638801 Talk him out of it?
3639136 3640594 Whatever for?
3641096 3645099 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3645309 3648269 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3648520 3650646 -...we can sit down--<br />-No, he's here.
3650897 3652231 -He's here?<br />-He's here now.
3652399 3653399 Alphonse!
3653567 3654734 Alphonse?
3662159 3663451 How you doing?

5248201 5250912 You can't imagine the surprise.
5251121 5256000 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5257669 5258961 Your wife, right?
5261340 5263424 She didn't die straight away.
