39680 42400 God! l love this job! Man!<br />Can't you go faster?
42640 44480 - Floor this thing!<br />- It's my wife's.
44720 47320 - I won't go faster.<br />- You're doing 65 now.
47560 49040 65?! Shit!
49280 53400 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
54520 57640 We're eastbound on Fourth,<br />in pursuit of a red BMW...
57880 59360 ...driver Caucasian, blond.
59600 63280 {y:i}Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.
63640 66760 {y:i}You are westbound on Second.<br />{y:i}20-William-12 is southbound...
67000 70320 ...approaching Second.<br />You're heading right for each other.
70560 72360 {y:i}- Somebody back off.<br />- Got it!
72600 75840 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
76080 80480 - You're gonna get us killed!<br />- Shit! I'm...
93560 97360 We'll stick with this red<br />son of a bitch. You chase the blue.
97600 101040 20-William-15, that's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
101280 105600 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.
105840 107560 - Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And the squad.
107800 110240 - $ 20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
110480 112040 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
112280 115240 I knew nothing about the wife's<br />station wagon. Bet's off!
115480 117960 Shut up!
125520 126760 What the hell is that?
127000 129320 What fucking language is that?
129560 130960 It's German.
131200 132080 Japanese?
132320 135120 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the LAPD.
135360 137840 They own everything.
141880 144680 Shotgun!
151800 153840 Shots are being fired.
154080 155720 Thanks for the scoop.
155960 158480 The son of a bitch shot<br />my wife's windshield.
158720 161400 Entering the pursuit.
172800 176880 Shit, man!<br />We're splitting up!
179640 183240 Son of a bitch!<br />Now we're cooking!
185720 188000 Step on it!
199160 201600 Look out!
206960 209560 See you!
228440 232600 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
246200 248520 We got one.<br />Yours is going up the hill.
248760 251480 {y:i}So is Riggs, on foot!
253680 256680 Hey, Riggs!<br />Get your slow ass in here!
256920 258640 Get in here. Now!
258880 259800 Only if I drive.
260040 261600 Move over, I'll drive.
261840 264160 No, go around. I'm driving.
264400 267200 I'll drive.
267360 269760 Did you get a make<br />on that red Beemer yet?
270000 272840 Not a scratch, you hear?
276440 277920 You're not gonna make it.
278160 279400 There's no room!
279640 281960 You're not gonna make it!
282200 286080 Look at my side panel!
294160 296640 Goddamn it, you were right, you know.
296880 300360 There wasn't enough room.
314040 317800 Get down! Get down!
317880 321240 Get down, stay down!
358800 361640 He's making a hard right.
369200 372440 Get out of the way!
385200 386880 This was a new car, Riggs.
387120 389600 It still is.
395480 397040 On three.
397280 398560 One...
398800 401800 ...two... three!
402040 404640 Shit!
404800 406840 You forgot your left indicator.
407080 409360 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
409600 412440 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamn it!
412680 414040 Me?! Where'd he go?!
414280 416840 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
417080 419880 - You come on "three"!<br />- It's "three", then go!
420120 421800 No! We always go on "three"!
422040 425920 Sometimes we go,<br />"one, two, three", then go!
426160 429800 Go check back there!
432440 435040 What was that?
435640 439320 - He's in the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
444320 446280 Holy Christ!
446520 449840 That's a lot of money.
451840 453920 What is this?
454160 455880 It's gold!
456120 457360 Fucking gold!
457600 458640 Krugerrands.
458880 461760 It's illegal. You can't<br />import this into the country.
462000 463080 You're right.
463320 466640 The damage you caused comes<br />out of the department's budget.
466880 470600 - Pay it off in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
470840 472840 You came up empty,<br />I want an explanation.
473080 476680 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said it was a routine bust.
476920 481760 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
482000 484080 This was bigger than we thought.
484320 487160 Talk to you later.
491840 495840 I worked psycho ward, Riggs.<br />You'll never get out.
496080 498360 One minute, 15 seconds.
498600 501560 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
501800 506240 What's going on here? Is this a<br />kindergarten class or a police station?
506480 508360 Let's get some work done.
508600 511120 Houdini Jr. Bets he can<br />free himself in five minutes.
511360 513760 I will too.
517320 520800 Don't try this at home, kids.
528800 530200 It's all over now.
530440 534920 Put your money on the table,<br />and get back to work.
535360 538120 Suckers!
540640 542440 Somebody check that thing, man.
542680 546120 How the hell did you do that?
546360 549800 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />I can do it whenever I want to now.
550040 551560 Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?
551800 554080 Yeah, it does.
554320 555840 But not as much as...
556080 559240 ...when I put it back in.
567920 570080 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
570320 573280 My door is always open, sergeant.
573520 577840 I think we ought to keep this<br />on a professional level, don't you?
578080 580840 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
581080 583880 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
584120 585480 And I need the money.
585720 588000 Cough up!
589160 593360 It's not all here yet.<br />I want it all. I want the lot.
598720 601160 Where did this come from?
601400 603440 You can't help yourself to this stuff.
603680 606280 This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
606520 609040 - That's mine. I won that.<br />- It's not yours.
609280 612400 You want to get busted?
612640 614520 Want to get something to eat?
614760 617640 Not tonight.<br />Rianne's commercial is on.
617880 620560 - Rianne's in a commercial?<br />- Not so loud!
620800 624080 What's the matter?<br />I'd be proud of her if I was you.
624320 627640 I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.<br />What if she stinks?
627880 629720 You gotta be kidding.<br />She'll be great!
629960 632200 Everybody, listen up!
632440 634480 Tonight at...<br />What time?
634720 635600 Come on!
635840 637600 What time?
637840 638680 8:00.
638920 642120 At 8:00 on channel...?
642960 645840 Eight. The sergeant's<br />beautiful daughter Rianne...
646080 648320 Here's her picture.
648560 653400 She'll make her television debut<br />in a commercial.
658080 662400 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
673720 677400 - Thought I'd get a new windshield.<br />- Don't worry, it'll be fine.
677640 679800 - The hood.<br />- We got a new hood on order.
680040 682040 - No bumper.<br />- We got a bumper on order.
682280 684160 See you back at your place, Rog.
684400 687560 - If you ever get there.<br />- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
687800 690320 Be careful.<br />The mirror's got tape around it.
690560 694280 Oh, boy. Shit.
705440 708680 What happened? This was a new car.<br />Mom's gonna be upset!
708920 711560 - It's still new.<br />- It's not! It's wrecked!
711800 715120 I don't want your mother to know<br />about it.
715360 716840 Do your homework too.
717080 719880 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
720120 722440 Why don't you look out for me?
722680 726840 Hey, Ricky! I want to use<br />my driveway once in a while.
727080 728800 Nice oxygen tent.
729040 732520 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
732760 736760 This is a two-car garage, and this is<br />my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.
737000 740680 I retire when I'm 52, and the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
740920 743360 Cut it out.<br />You're not retiring, are you?
743600 746480 - I've thought of it since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
746720 751480 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
752920 753920 Jesus Christ!
754160 755880 What's wrong with you guys?
756120 758160 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
758400 761160 You're sorry?<br />Check my shorts, for chrissakes!
761400 764240 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
764480 765800 Easy, easy.
766040 770360 It's no Saturday night special,<br />for crying out loud.
770600 773800 All right, give it back.
774080 775840 A man's not safe in his own home.
776080 778280 Stay the hell out of here, then.
778520 780080 You got any traffic warrants?
780320 783040 Why? Can you fix them?
788520 790680 Almost time.<br />Are we taping this?
790920 793680 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
793920 795160 Take the stairs.
795400 798440 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
798680 801480 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
801720 803280 I want my baby to look good.
803520 804240 Unplug it.
804480 805640 That's your sister!
805880 807200 Picture's perfect.
807440 809400 You think so?
809640 810760 Do I know you?
811000 811800 Yes, sir.
812040 814640 We had a long talk about a week ago.<br />Remember?
814880 816240 We did? About what?
816480 820880 - About your new hobby room.<br />- This is George!
821440 825040 - How you doing?<br />- Did you sense that I liked you?
825280 826960 Yes, sir.
827200 830600 Then sit down and be quiet.
832120 835040 - What's that you're eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
835280 836640 Tuna?!
836880 838760 Daddy, you can't eat tuna.
839000 840360 Dad killed Flipper.
840600 842200 We're boycotting tuna.
842440 846600 They kill the dolphins that get caught<br />in the nets. Only albacore.
846840 847880 Have ham.
848120 850320 Eat Miss Piggy.
850560 854080 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
857440 860680 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
862040 864080 My baby!
864320 867880 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
875160 877240 {y:i}When the time has come...
877480 880200 {y:i}... and the moment is right...
880440 881800 {y:i}... remember...
882040 885000 {y:i}... use Ramses Extra Condoms.
885240 886080 {y:i}We do!
886320 887880 {y:i}Ramses Extra.
888120 892800 {y:i}Because caring means<br />{y:i}all the protection you can get.
900280 902320 Take the kids upstairs.
902560 904280 We learn this in human development.
904520 906840 In human what?!<br />Human development what?!
907080 908680 Development. Chill out.
908920 910040 Upstairs.
910280 912040 Nick, upstairs.
912280 914360 You know how your father is.
914600 918440 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
919120 921080 Home. Out.
921320 923760 George, I got a gun.
927520 929640 What's with you?<br />She looked beautiful.
929880 934920 I liked it. She made me want<br />to buy rubbers right now.
940120 943680 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was just...
943920 946240 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
946480 948280 I think she's got a future.<br />Don't you?
948520 951120 - Yeah, she was good.<br />- George is afraid of Daddy.
951360 952640 Stick around.
952880 954120 Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.
954360 958160 Yeah, but it's an old gun,<br />and he's not a very good shot.
958400 960760 That's good.<br />I'm going anyway. Good night.
961000 963560 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- Let him buy the beer.
963800 964920 You're under 21.
965160 967600 Be back by midnight.
967840 970200 Wait and see.<br />Cops never let up, you know?
970440 973960 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />in the mail, in the coffee...
974200 978560 If you'd only shut your mouth. You<br />told everybody. I'm going for a walk.
978800 983280 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
994480 996400 How goes it with you, Hans?
996640 999480 Okay. You, Pieter?
999720 1004160 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1004520 1008480 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having some painting done.
1008720 1011600 The important thing is,<br />are you all right?
1011840 1013960 No bones broken?
1014200 1015440 I'm fine, thank you.
1015680 1017840 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1018080 1019400 Yeah, that's all.
1019640 1022600 Good, good.
1024480 1028400 However, we did lose over $ 1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1028640 1031880 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1032120 1033440 It happens.
1033680 1035600 It's not your fault.
1035840 1039160 Sometimes these things<br />do not go as planned.
1039400 1044240 As you say, they just happen,<br />eh, Pieter?
1050600 1054280 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word "dropcloth".
1054520 1058760 Certain policemen in this city<br />have become an intolerable nuisance.
1059000 1063280 They are obviously onto us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1063520 1066440 Warn them off.
1066600 1068720 It's my experience...
1068960 1071880 ...that a scared cop is<br />more useful than a dead one.
1072120 1073480 A warning?
1073720 1075760 Is that not a bit tame?
1076000 1078720 Depends how you do it.
1079040 1082400 Then you'd better look at this.
1087080 1091920 This is the policeman in charge.
1092960 1095640 Goddamn "kaffir".
1095760 1097680 Lovely.
1097920 1100200 Remember to take these in order.
1100440 1103560 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1103800 1104600 Thank you.
1104840 1106760 This yours?
1107000 1109920 I found it in the wash.
1113040 1114680 Thanks.
1114920 1117240 I keep on losing this.
1117480 1118520 Something's wrong.
1118760 1123680 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1125040 1126520 What about the pen?
1126760 1129360 It just reminds me of something.
1129600 1131240 Reminds you of what?
1131480 1133040 It reminds me of...
1133280 1135960 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1136200 1138920 I didn't mean to push.
1138920 1143000 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1146320 1150520 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1150760 1153560 I had so much work.
1154400 1157680 I forgot about the whole thing.
1157840 1163440 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1163480 1167480 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1167720 1171520 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.
1175360 1180000 I should've been driving.<br />We'd have been all right.
1180840 1184600 I remember falling down on my knees,<br />and I started shaking all over.
1184840 1188360 I remember thinking,<br />"I'm just losing it".
1188600 1192080 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1192320 1196840 Lying there, and I'm seeing under<br />the couch, and I see this gold pen...
1197080 1198280 ...just lying there.
1198520 1203600 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1203800 1207320 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1207440 1211560 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1211800 1215200 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1215440 1217640 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1217880 1219760 Muscles were still working.
1220000 1222600 Then I drove to the hospital...
1222840 1225720 ...identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.
1225960 1230600 Gold pen? Trish found<br />a gold pen in the laundry.
1238120 1241520 Look around you, Sam.<br />Look around you.
1241760 1243920 One day, Sam...
1244160 1247360 ...this'll all be yours.
1249200 1252720 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1252960 1256600 A man could live here and be happy.
1259200 1262840 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?
1263080 1266280 Let's go watch some TV.
1350360 1353120 "Kaffirs!"
1354800 1357200 Wondering about your kids?
1357440 1360200 You wondering what we done to them?
1360440 1363720 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1363960 1366800 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1367040 1368960 Want to know what we done?
1369200 1371480 Shall I tell you?
1371960 1375000 You just let your imagination<br />run riot.
1375240 1377160 This has just been a warning.
1377400 1381000 After this, it gets bloody.<br />You tell your people to back off.
1381240 1383280 Don't be a smart "kaffir".
1383520 1387680 Maybe we let you live, huh?<br />Come on, let's go.
1405240 1408080 - You didn't see a face?<br />- Not one. They all had on hoods.
1408320 1409480 What about a voice?
1409720 1414080 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1414320 1415880 Not German, not English.
1416120 1418800 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1419040 1422400 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1422640 1425120 Yeah, kind of like that.
1425360 1426680 Trish and the kids?
1426920 1429640 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1429880 1434080 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?
1434320 1436200 Forensics get back with anything?
1436440 1438560 Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.
1438800 1441960 The point being, we gotta watch<br />each other's backs and fronts.
1442200 1445880 You're all invited to watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1446120 1450480 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1454360 1456880 I got something special for you boys.
1457120 1459920 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1460160 1463840 You guys are gonna babysit him<br />until Washington sends the feds.
1464080 1467040 - How long?<br />- Soon as the red tape is processed.
1467280 1468520 Three days.
1468760 1472680 This guy Getz is gonna testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1472920 1475240 Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.
1475480 1478800 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1478840 1480520 This is not a shit assignment.
1480760 1482680 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1482920 1484720 - It isn't.<br />- It's a shit assignment.
1484960 1486400 Shut up, the both of you.
1486640 1487640 Here you go, sir.
1487880 1490160 - I guaranteed this guy's safety.<br />- Why us?
1490400 1493600 Because you two are<br />the most qualified for the job.
1493840 1496560 And after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1496800 1499000 I can handle last night.
1499240 1500440 What do we do with him?
1500680 1502840 How should I know?<br />Take him to Disneyland.
1503080 1504760 This stinks. This stinks.
1505000 1506120 I don't give a fuck.
1506360 1509360 I don't have an ulcer,<br />because I know when to say that.
1509600 1511920 Here's where he's staying.<br />It's a nice hotel.
1512160 1516280 Expenses are paid by the Justice<br />Department, so enjoy yourselves.
1516520 1519360 One more thing.
1520760 1521800 Know what that says?
1522040 1526120 Same thing as that.<br />But I don't give a fuck.
1528440 1532680 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1543640 1546240 What a joint!
1546480 1549760 Excuse me, ma'am, where's the lobby?
1550000 1551760 That's this way.
1552000 1554280 Hey, come on. Come on.
1554520 1557200 What I wouldn't pay to have this pool<br />in my back yard.
1557440 1558280 You can't swim.
1558520 1561720 I could get my stroke down.
1562120 1563880 - What's the water like?<br />- Great.
1564120 1566840 - How's the temperature?<br />- Great. Why don't you come in?
1567080 1571480 As an employee, I can't get into these<br />things. If I get caught, I get fired.
1571720 1573880 Everything okay for you at the hotel?
1574120 1576120 No problem?<br />Nothing I can do for you?
1576360 1579400 Excuse me. I see you're coming out<br />of your shell.
1579640 1581520 - Hotel psychiatrist.<br />- Join us also.
1581760 1585280 Our patient, Mr. Getz, is waiting<br />for us upstairs.
1585520 1586800 Want to talk to Mr. Murphy?
1587040 1589640 Yeah, I gotta go to work. Bye.
1589880 1591600 - Come back.<br />- We'll be waiting.
1591840 1595400 Can any of you cook?
1595640 1597280 Let's go. Murphy.
1597520 1600560 The girls in this place.<br />This is where they live in the day.
1600800 1603040 This is where my tax money goes too.
1603280 1604720 Leo lives like this.
1604960 1606640 Where's the elevator?
1606880 1608600 Down the hall to the right.
1608840 1612720 Are you gentlemen guests of the hotel?
1615800 1617200 Excuse me.
1617440 1619040 What room is that for?
1619280 1621640 612.
1622920 1626120 This is it. 612.
1627160 1628920 - Who is it?<br />- Police.
1629160 1630480 How do I know that?
1630720 1635520 After I shoot you through the door,<br />you can examine the bullet.
1635840 1637880 Don't you want to see a badge?
1638120 1639440 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1639680 1642080 I get it.<br />Bad cop, good cop.
1642320 1644600 Shut up!
1644840 1646960 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1647200 1650040 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1650280 1653880 Whatever you need, Leo gets.<br />You get it?
1654120 1656840 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1657080 1658960 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.<br />This is Sgt. Riggs.
1659200 1662280 How you doing? Nice to meet you.<br />What do I call you guys?
1662520 1667160 - Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.<br />- We're gonna be your shadow.
1667800 1670840 That's all right.<br />An old-fashioned...!
1671080 1673960 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1674200 1676880 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1677120 1680040 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1680280 1681360 Yep, a Beretta.
1681600 1683400 Don't touch it.
1683640 1685800 You sure you guys are cops?
1686040 1691080 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm the state's star witness.
1691080 1693240 We'll take that room.
1693480 1698760 Actually, I already have my stuff<br />in this room. You know, when I...
1703240 1704960 It's yours. My stuff's gone.
1705200 1707520 I'll move it in the small room, okay?
1707760 1711040 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1711280 1715920 Come on, loosen up a little, guys.<br />We'll be together a long time.
1716160 1717920 I'll get it.
1718160 1720360 It's only room service.
1720600 1723080 You hungry? I'll call<br />and get anything you want.
1723320 1725680 See this silk robe?<br />Silk pajamas? Free!
1725920 1727440 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is!
1727680 1732120 - It's taxpayers'money.<br />- Oh, God! It's the same thing.
1734120 1737080 Good morning, gentlemen.
1739320 1743440 That's my food! You guys didn't<br />want anything. Bring it here.
1743680 1745360 It's mine. Boy!
1745600 1748200 You could've had anything you wanted.
1748440 1751600 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1755960 1758960 Martin, not the window!
1760200 1762720 Shit!
1785920 1788760 Where is that son of a bitch?
1789080 1793160 Somebody stop that guy!<br />Stop him!
1793400 1797040 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1797280 1798920 Get off me!
1799160 1801600 Get off me!
1802040 1806640 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back.
1806880 1810040 Clear, move it! Get back! Police!
1810280 1811040 You all right?
1811280 1813920 I'm okay.<br />Why didn't you follow me down?
1814160 1817520 - Why didn't you?<br />- I was seven floors up!
1817760 1818760 He hit me.
1819000 1821480 Good!
1822040 1824800 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1825040 1826720 Did you witness a murder?
1826960 1830480 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1831360 1836560 All I did was, I laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1836800 1838680 Half a billion dollars?
1838920 1842400 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1842640 1846120 Could I please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1846360 1848400 Could you please shut up?
1848640 1851840 - You're supposed to take care of me.<br />- Shut up!
1852080 1856040 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1856280 1861200 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1861440 1863280 What are you doing?
1863520 1867320 Just checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1867560 1869560 Okay, I got it. Okay, here.
1869800 1873160 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1873400 1876000 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1876240 1878480 I bring it to you.
1878720 1881720 - He does.<br />- Me? I don't understand. Why me?
1881960 1883080 Who am I?
1883320 1884720 I'll tell you.
1884960 1887240 You're a courier. You work for him.
1887480 1890720 I'm the drug dealer.
1892360 1897480 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1897760 1903080 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1903320 1906520 Then I issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1906760 1909960 ...minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1910200 1911840 - You like breathing?<br />- How much?
1912080 1913520 Two percent.
1913760 1918240 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1918680 1921760 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1922000 1925400 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1925640 1926560 How's that work?
1926800 1929280 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1929520 1933240 It's your money. You don't pay<br />it back. It's yours, and it's clean!
1933480 1936760 It is now laundered.
1937000 1940640 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
1940920 1943360 This is the best part. You got it?
1943600 1946640 You take a tax deduction...
1946880 1951280 ...on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
1951520 1953840 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1954080 1955000 Cheat!
1955240 1956680 Come on.
1956920 1959400 Everybody cheats.<br />Look at the Pentagon.
1959640 1962360 So you got it?
1962800 1965960 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
1966200 1968560 I was scamming those guys for months.
1968800 1970640 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1970880 1971960 You?
1972200 1974360 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
1974600 1977680 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1977920 1981600 Who's gonna miss $ 10,000 here,<br />$ 20,000 there?
1981840 1983520 Drug dealers.
1983760 1985440 That's right. They did.
1985680 1989720 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1990720 1992600 You can give that to Nick.
1992840 1995760 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
1996000 1996960 It's small, Leroy.
1997200 2001160 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I'll buy you another shirt!
2001400 2004200 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
2004440 2008040 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
2008280 2013240 - Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />- On the shelf in back of the machine.
2013480 2017280 You never met anyone except couriers?
2017360 2020200 No names.
2021840 2024840 Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br />Come to think of it...
2025080 2026200 Okay, listen.
2026440 2030120 They took me up to the hills<br />in this house with stilts on it.
2030360 2033160 And I had a job interview<br />with a guy...
2033400 2036000 ...and his name was...
2036240 2037680 ...Haynes. Hans!
2037920 2040120 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2040360 2042240 It won't do any harm to look.
2042480 2044480 - I know the address.<br />- Let's go.
2044720 2045600 We shouldn't!
2045840 2047760 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2048000 2050440 We're back, we're bad!<br />You're black, I'm mad.
2050680 2052480 This is going to be great!
2052720 2056960 If we're going,<br />shouldn't I have a gun?
2057840 2060200 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2060440 2063520 I'm sorry about that.
2069200 2072200 That's downtown L.A.<br />How'd you like to have a house here?
2072440 2075720 It'd be okay three days of the year<br />when you can actually see it.
2075960 2078960 Get a fresh breath.
2079040 2082000 It's been two hours and six places.<br />You sure of the address?
2082240 2084840 I told you I wasn't sure<br />of the exact address.
2085080 2086200 What are you sure of?
2086440 2088280 I'm sure the numbers add up to 28.
2088520 2093120 I remember because I was 28 when I<br />became a certified public accountant.
2093360 2094880 We can figure this out.
2095120 2097800 There's four numbers.<br />The first one has to be a nine.
2098040 2102520 Nine is my lucky number. I was born<br />on the ninth day of the ninth month.
2102760 2107520 - This is ridiculous.<br />- Hang on. Maybe not, maybe not.
2107880 2110840 There aren't many streets<br />in Bel Air that begin with nine...
2111080 2113000 ...with four numbers in the address.
2113240 2117480 - How many's not that many?<br />- Let's have a look.
2121160 2123880 Well, I meant more than<br />10 or 12 streets.
2124120 2126440 This is thin, Riggs.<br />This is very thin.
2126680 2128360 This is anorexic.
2128600 2131960 - Such as 739, 658.
2132200 2133640 Okay, that's it.
2133880 2135360 That's it.
2135600 2137480 Look. This is it. See?
2137720 2140560 The last three numbers have to be<br />either 739 or 658.
2140800 2144080 The first number's gotta be a 9<br />because 9 was my lucky number.
2144320 2147120 I was born on the ninth day...<br />See, that's it.
2147360 2148880 I tell you, I could do it.
2149120 2150000 Take us there.
2150240 2154120 - We need a street, that's all.<br />- Is that all?
2154160 2157200 - How's that?<br />- Good enough for me.
2157440 2159280 Leo, this is the seventh place.
2159520 2161760 - We have the numbers.<br />- And the seventh time.
2162000 2166120 - Just jumble them around.<br />- It's a lucky number.
2168000 2169720 It should be coming up soon.
2169960 2172120 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2172360 2175520 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility.
2175760 2178840 That's it! Nine. My lucky number.
2179080 2182240 Stay in the car, you hear?
2182480 2185720 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2186440 2187920 Nice car.
2188160 2189960 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2190200 2192160 You're not looking<br />at what you're doing!
2192400 2196240 I know what I'm doing. I'm towing<br />your car, not a baby carriage.
2196480 2199360 You're chipping the paint.<br />I can hear it!
2199600 2202320 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell something.
2202560 2204280 What's that? A rat?
2204520 2207800 A stinky one too.
2209680 2210840 Where you going?
2211080 2213640 I'm a peeping Tom.<br />It goes with the badge.
2213880 2216760 It's fun sometimes too.
2217200 2219520 Bingo!
2222160 2223520 Lars, look!
2223760 2227000 What the fuck?
2230280 2232320 - Where's the pool?<br />- There's no pool.
2232560 2233440 There's no pool.
2233680 2235480 This house is built on stilts.
2235720 2239280 Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.
2249200 2252000 Cuff yourselves.
2257240 2260280 Not this again.
2270480 2272640 Riggs! Where you at?
2272880 2275520 Stay where you are. Don't move.
2275760 2276960 You all right?
2277200 2279840 Move that truck.
2280000 2282480 Give me your keys!
2283360 2285040 You all right?
2285280 2286200 Where you going?
2286440 2287800 That was the hotel waiter.
2288040 2289440 Wait for me!
2289680 2290760 Get out of here!
2291000 2296240 What are you doing? You can't<br />take my truck! What's going on?
2297480 2300960 Don't worry.<br />We'll bring it right back.
2306440 2307280 Gotcha!
2307520 2309760 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2310000 2311800 Where did he go?
2312040 2313760 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2314000 2317800 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2318040 2320360 Get back! It's police business!
2320600 2324800 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2341600 2345760 Go faster! We gotta catch him<br />and your partner.
2359080 2361960 Hello, asshole!
2389200 2392840 Come on, come on. Give me that!
2406720 2409160 There they are! Hurry up!
2409400 2411160 Come on! Can't you go faster?
2411400 2414840 Will you shut the fuck up?
2420560 2423040 Look out!
2461680 2464560 Oh, shit!
2487880 2489960 Wipeout! It's all under control.
2490200 2493600 I told you to look out!
2494400 2497280 - You're too old to drive this car.<br />- Shut up!
2497520 2498400 And stay!
2498640 2501800 What do you think I am, a dog?
2514000 2517000 Hands behind your neck!
2520440 2523640 What are you doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2523880 2524920 What's going on?
2525160 2527200 Freeze, dickhead!
2527440 2529920 Get down here, dickhead.<br />It's been a bad day.
2530160 2531240 Show me your hands.
2531480 2533400 Take it easy, officer.
2533640 2537360 I'm not armed. I won't resist.
2537600 2540560 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right.
2540800 2543800 Do as I say!
2546640 2548360 Get your hands on your head.
2548600 2550080 Lace them behind your head!
2550320 2552320 You have no idea what you're doing.
2552560 2556680 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2556920 2558760 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2559000 2564000 I'm minister of diplomatic affairs<br />for the South African Consulate.
2564240 2566080 South Africa,<br />home of the Krugerrand.
2566320 2567840 Among other things.
2568080 2570680 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2570920 2574600 We have diplomatic credentials...
2575040 2578080 Keep your hands high.
2580440 2583160 Give me that.
2584880 2587560 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2587800 2590640 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2590880 2593960 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2594200 2595440 Pieter Von... Vor...
2595680 2598120 Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.
2598360 2602120 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2602360 2605280 - That's you.<br />- It's official.
2605520 2607360 They are official.
2607600 2609880 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2610120 2613480 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2613720 2618120 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2618480 2621840 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2622080 2625360 ...which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2625600 2629320 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2629560 2632120 My dear officer...
2632360 2636480 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2638080 2641440 Who is the dickhead now?
2643160 2646000 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2646240 2648200 This is South African soil.
2648440 2651000 Now get out of here.
2651240 2653760 All of you.
2656920 2659880 Come on, let's go.
2660760 2662000 Hey, man, don't do it.
2662240 2668200 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I'll make you eat this thing.
2669080 2671720 "Kaffir"!
2672080 2674720 With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2674960 2678600 - I went to school with him.<br />- Yeah, right.
2678880 2683600 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2683960 2687560 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2687760 2690600 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2690960 2692840 Don't open that.
2693080 2694560 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2694800 2698440 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2698680 2701960 Is he serious with this stuff?
2702160 2704840 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2705080 2707840 They were just leaving.
2708960 2711440 She is a consulate secretary.
2711680 2714840 Give her back the briefcase.
2716160 2718960 Give it to her.
2719680 2723760 Here. I'm sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2723960 2725440 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2725680 2728280 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2728520 2732600 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2738080 2742000 I'd start getting used to<br />that sort of view.
2749240 2751240 - It's the Triangle Trade again.<br />- The what?
2751480 2754040 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2754280 2756040 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2756280 2758280 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2758520 2762120 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2762360 2765640 ...and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2765880 2770120 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2770360 2771480 Apologize?
2771720 2773840 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2774080 2776680 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2776920 2781000 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2781240 2783360 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2783600 2784400 Yes, sir.
2784640 2789600 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2789960 2794400 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2794640 2797440 - He's alive, isn't he?<br />- It's okay. I signed a waiver.
2797680 2800960 - Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />- Usually? Usually?
2801200 2803120 They're very adamant about that.
2803360 2806400 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops. They're the best.
2806640 2808800 One time, a guy was waving a gun...
2809040 2811720 What'd he say?
2812320 2813320 What did he say?
2813560 2815760 "I don't give a fuck."<br />It's his mantra.
2816000 2820120 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2820360 2821760 It's a rubber plant!
2822000 2824720 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2824960 2825840 Go spit.
2826080 2830600 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2831680 2835640 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2850080 2853120 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2856880 2860520 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2863200 2866160 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2866400 2869280 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2869520 2871680 Why don't you explain it to me?
2871920 2876320 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2876560 2880440 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2880680 2883960 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2884200 2886320 Our consulate, its staff...
2886560 2892160 ...and particularly myself, will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2897880 2901080 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
2910480 2912320 Things are getting out of hand.
2912560 2914840 We are suffering too many losses.
2915080 2917680 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
2917920 2920200 We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
2920440 2924120 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2924360 2928440 Your warning did not work.
2934520 2936360 - Come on, Leo, let's go!<br />- I'm coming.
2936600 2938720 Come on! Move!
2938960 2941080 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2941320 2944520 - Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />- Come on, Leo.
2944760 2947800 Give me the food.
2951280 2954440 - Who ordered the super combo?<br />- Over here.
2954680 2956360 I get a steak sandwich.
2956600 2957640 Who gets Leo?
2957880 2959560 You got a big, empty house.
2959800 2962000 I got a trailer.<br />What will I do with him?
2962240 2964400 My place is too small. You take him.
2964640 2965920 I had him last night.
2966160 2968400 Excuse me, fellas!
2968640 2970800 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2971040 2974160 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
2974400 2977520 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- Where were you? I just said that!
2977760 2979960 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2980200 2981640 We're not going back. Shut up!
2981880 2984680 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
2984920 2988000 Can I give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
2988240 2991720 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2991960 2993880 You know why? Let me tell you.
2994120 2997440 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
2997680 3001480 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
3001720 3003920 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
3004160 3006840 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
3007080 3008800 I'm not eating this tuna!
3009040 3011960 Shut up!
3080360 3082040 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
3082280 3085600 - Get rid of that man.<br />- Yes, sir.
3086760 3091400 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3099240 3102080 The morning faxes.
3136360 3140000 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3140240 3144480 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3153520 3154880 What are you doing?
3155120 3156960 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3157200 3159200 I like living the way I live.
3159440 3163320 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3163560 3166320 - There's a pan under there?<br />- Oh, please. Come on.
3166560 3169160 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3169400 3170920 Where's my TV?
3171160 3172960 Everything is outside.
3173200 3174720 Just stop what you're doing.
3174960 3177960 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3178200 3181360 Out, out! Oh, man!
3184800 3186560 {y:i}Riggs, it's Collins.
3186800 3189960 {y:i}- Has Murtaugh checked in with you?<br />- No, he hasn't. Why?
3190200 3194080 {y:i}I haven't heard from him.<br />{y:i}He doesn't answer his phone.
3194320 3196840 I'll be right there.
3201000 3202320 Stay in the car.
3202560 3205080 Get in there.
3209720 3211120 I'm upstairs!
3211360 3214480 Should I call 999,<br />"Officer in distress"?
3214720 3215800 I'll cover the back!
3216040 3219880 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
3234240 3236920 In here.
3249760 3252240 Good morning.
3257280 3260880 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3261120 3264520 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3264760 3269600 Just me and my new<br />"Salt Water Sportsman" magazine.
3277000 3281720 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3288680 3293320 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3293560 3297280 ...when I glanced over,<br />I saw this.
3300200 3302560 Oh, Jesus!
3302800 3303760 Is that all?
3304000 3308640 - You scared the shit out of me.<br />- Scared the shit out of you?
3308880 3310280 How long you been here?
3310520 3312240 I've been here all night.
3312480 3315200 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if I can...
3315440 3316720 Don't move.
3316960 3318080 I can't.
3318320 3321720 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3321960 3326120 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3338400 3340840 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3341080 3343800 He's fucked.
3344360 3347760 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3348000 3350040 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3350280 3351520 That's a relief.
3351760 3354280 - I'll have to get help.<br />- No way!
3354520 3357360 Why?
3357640 3360000 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3360240 3363880 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3364120 3366640 Bomb Squad?
3370800 3374240 Okay, call them in.
3375600 3379880 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3383360 3385920 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3386160 3389160 Sure. Trust me.
3404200 3405360 Excuse me, please.
3405600 3407600 Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3407840 3411440 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3411680 3414920 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3415160 3420160 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3421520 3423040 I was wrong.
3423280 3426240 Excuse me.
3428200 3432640 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3436880 3438800 Split.
3439040 3441560 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3441800 3445240 It's ready to come out.
3445840 3449240 I gotta live in this house!
3449880 3452360 Clear this room.
3452720 3455680 Come on, Riggs.
3457960 3461160 - You too, Riggs.<br />- No.
3461200 3464480 Riggs. Out.
3470040 3472920 All right.
3473680 3475520 Dive into the tub.
3475760 3478760 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3479000 3482800 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3483040 3484080 I can't do it.
3484320 3487240 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.
3487480 3489240 He can't even walk.
3489480 3491920 I'll have to help him.
3492160 3494920 All right, you better wear this.
3495160 3498560 - How's the nitrogen?<br />- Almost there.
3500680 3504120 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3504360 3507000 ...to give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3507240 3510160 - Got that?<br />- A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3510400 3511400 Lights out!
3511640 3514640 Get him up and out.
3516760 3519840 - Let's go.<br />- Move!
3521200 3522960 Good luck.
3523200 3524480 You got a piece?
3524720 3526440 - A Smith & Wesson.<br />- Try this.
3526680 3530280 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3530640 3533560 Good luck.
3535440 3538320 All right, let's move.
3545800 3548160 Alone at last.
3548400 3551400 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3551640 3556360 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3567640 3569680 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3569920 3572280 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3572520 3576880 Anyway, I'm here, and I don't<br />plan on going just now.
3577600 3580400 Let's do it.
3585320 3586280 On "three".
3586520 3589000 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3589240 3591480 I'm just gonna give you the...
3591720 3595320 On "three", huh? What do you say?
3596240 3598080 One...
3598320 3601720 ...two...<br />- Wait!
3602320 3605040 Do we do it on "three"...
3605280 3607080 ...or "one, two, three"...
3607320 3609560 ...then do it?<br />- Well, it's your ass.
3609800 3611880 It's up to you.
3612120 3613560 My ass, yeah.
3613800 3614880 "Three."
3615120 3616480 We go on "three"?
3616720 3620520 "One, two" and then "three"!
3622440 3623520 One...
3623760 3626560 - Martin?<br />- What?
3631640 3633600 I know.
3633840 3636840 I mean it, man.
3638200 3640960 I hear you.
3642080 3645240 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3645480 3647280 On "three".
3647520 3649280 One...
3649520 3650680 ...two...
3650920 3653480 ...three!
3661160 3664120 I gotta go! I gotta go!
3680120 3684760 Get off me. I don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3687120 3689040 Mr. Jones?
3689280 3692600 Sit down, please.
3693720 3695640 What can I do for you today?
3695880 3698560 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3698800 3701280 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3701520 3703680 Of course, I can help him do that.
3703920 3706760 I want you to talk him out of it.
3707000 3708200 Talk him out of it?
3708440 3710080 Whatever for?
3710320 3714120 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3714360 3717160 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3717400 3719440 ...we can sit down...<br />- No, he's here.
3719680 3720920 - He's here?<br />- He's here now.
3721160 3722040 Alphonse!
3722280 3724880 Alphonse?
3730520 3731720 How you doing?
3731960 3735280 There must be some mistake.
3736120 3738800 Say what?
3739600 3742960 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3743200 3745880 I don't think you want<br />to go to South Africa.
3746120 3748640 Why not?
3750200 3752960 Because you're black.
3754480 3755800 You are.
3756040 3757560 He is.
3757800 3761200 Of course I'm black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3761440 3763640 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3763880 3766520 ...against the tyranny<br />of the racist, fascist...
3766760 3768000 ...white, minority regime!
3768240 3769240 Fascist regime!
3769480 3770480 One man, one vote!
3770720 3771600 One man, one vote!
3771840 3773960 Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!
3774200 3775400 You son of a bitch!
3775640 3780280 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />I demand that you leave.
3780800 3782960 What's happening here?
3783200 3786080 Back off!
3788120 3792000 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3803280 3805840 End apartheid now!
3806080 3810560 You're telling me to shut up?<br />You gonna arrest me?
3828080 3830800 You can't push me out!
3890440 3892080 You call this security?
3892320 3897760 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3899320 3901080 Wait, gentlemen!
3901320 3905200 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
3905440 3908640 I should have known.
3909560 3911360 Well, well.
3911600 3914640 It's the master race!
3914880 3918000 I hope you realize the trouble<br />you are in right now.
3918240 3921600 As usual, you have everything<br />upside down and turned around...
3921840 3923120 ...and back to front.
3923360 3925000 Gentlemen...
3925240 3929080 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
3932800 3933760 Fingers off.
3934000 3936080 Hand off!
3936320 3939800 Let me look at that.
3940560 3944200 That's some piece of hardware.<br />Where the fuck do you get that stuff?
3944440 3948760 I've never seen that.<br />Where's it from? South Africa?
3949240 3951960 Don't move.
3956680 3960160 I'm surprised you haven't heard<br />about me. I got a bad reputation.
3960400 3963080 Sometimes I just go nuts.
3963320 3966000 Don't move.
3968960 3971640 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3971880 3974400 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3974640 3979080 You fold up your tents, and get<br />the fuck out of my country...
3979320 3981440 ...and I won't do anything to you.
3981680 3983320 I'll leave you alone.
3983560 3987160 If you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
3987400 3991280 Then I'll send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
3991520 3993920 Just get out of here...
3994160 3997560 ..."kaffir" lover.
4002240 4003600 Eenie...
4003840 4005280 ...meenie...
4005520 4007960 ...minie...
4008200 4010680 Hey, Moe!
4013120 4016000 Sorry, Adolf.
4016720 4019800 Pick them up with your hands.
4020040 4021600 Big smile.
4021840 4024680 Big smile!
4025360 4027520 Vorstedt, come over here!
4027760 4030400 Vorstedt!
4033040 4035520 - Hello. Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
4035760 4037200 What are you doing here?
4037440 4040560 I've been with your boss.<br />You know, shooting the breeze.
4040800 4043840 Shooting his fish.
4054280 4057040 The guy goes, "But, but, but...
4057280 4060160 ...you're black!"
4061440 4063080 He's black!
4063320 4066080 - I bet he was shitting.<br />- Started some shit with that!
4066320 4067800 You get into Rudd's office?
4068040 4069320 Yeah, I got up there.
4069560 4072160 Aryan Crud and his<br />Brown Shirts turned up...
4072400 4074680 ...but I ripped this off a pad.<br />What's that?
4074920 4078200 - "Alba Varden, Thursday."<br />- What do you think?
4078440 4080040 Is that Hitler's girlfriend?
4080280 4081320 That's Eva Braun.
4081560 4083360 He has a date with her Thursday.
4083600 4085040 Her name sounds familiar.
4085280 4087880 - You know her?<br />- No. It just sounds familiar.
4088120 4089680 Alba Varden...
4089920 4092920 There's a deli. Pull over.<br />Let's eat, I'm starving.
4093160 4094120 I'll spring.
4094360 4097600 Let's go. Sounds good to me.
4101240 4103200 - Out the other side.<br />- Other door, Leo.
4103440 4104480 Out the other door.
4104720 4107080 No cars.
4120720 4123520 Vorstedt!
4125960 4129000 That policeman.
4138200 4139920 You should pick from the bottom.
4140160 4141960 They put the old stock on top.
4142200 4144680 Officer Riggs.
4145240 4147160 I followed you from the consulate.
4147400 4148440 You followed me?
4148680 4154040 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush too.
4154640 4156320 I wanted to apologize...
4156560 4159280 ...for the other day,<br />in case we frightened you.
4159520 4162480 I was a bit startled<br />by all those guns.
4162720 4166280 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you too.
4166520 4169520 Thank me for what?
4172480 4175600 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4175840 4179680 There's a lot I don't like<br />about my boss and my country.
4179920 4181560 But I like my job very much.
4181800 4183920 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4184160 4186680 You like this town?
4186840 4188960 That's a new one.
4189200 4191880 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4192120 4193520 Rika Van H�agen-Dazs.
4193760 4196480 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.
4196720 4199760 That's a real pretty name.
4202480 4205200 - Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?<br />- It's mine.
4205440 4206720 Shop one day at a time?
4206960 4208440 Good police work.
4208680 4210560 I get paid for that.
4210800 4212640 I don't shop for the entire week.
4212880 4214600 No? Why not?
4214840 4219040 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4219280 4222400 Wait. Have dinner with me.
4222640 4227080 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4227320 4228600 A beautiful sunset.
4228840 4232080 Come on, be original, say yes.<br />Everyone else says no.
4232320 4234480 Come to my place.<br />I'm a gourmet cook.
4234720 4235920 Let go of the basket.
4236160 4237040 I'll scream.
4237280 4238160 - Don't.<br />- I will.
4238400 4239240 Please...
4239480 4242440 I'll embarrass you.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4242680 4244920 - Come on with me.<br />- No. No, please.
4245160 4249800 Lady, let go of my bag!<br />Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!
4250040 4251520 What are you doing?
4251760 4253960 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4254200 4257080 You are a cop.
4264040 4266200 You must be an honest<br />cop, Martin Riggs.
4266440 4272680 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4273280 4275600 I did exaggerate about one thing.
4275840 4279040 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4279280 4282520 - Do you like it with or without Oreos?<br />- With, of course.
4282760 4284560 A woman after my own heart.
4284800 4286800 Careful. Watch your step.
4287040 4288040 Sam wants in.
4288280 4289240 Here, sit down.
4289480 4291080 Wait a minute.
4291320 4294280 It's a little filthy.
4302040 4304160 I haven't got wine. How about a beer?
4304400 4306200 That's fine.
4306440 4309040 She drinks beer.
4323760 4327360 What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?
4327600 4331040 Oh, it's a wedding ring.
4331280 4332680 I used to be married.
4332920 4335400 But not anymore?
4335800 4338880 No. Not anymore.
4340600 4344600 I got something on the stove.
4346480 4349240 Is Rudd hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials?
4349480 4351120 What's that?
4351360 4355800 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4355920 4358840 He's not a very nice guy.
4359680 4364800 Then whatever he's doing,<br />he shouldn't get away with it.
4371360 4372800 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4373040 4375960 - What the hell do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4376200 4377960 Easy. Easy.
4378200 4381840 Tell me, have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4382080 4384840 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4385080 4386680 No, you were a cop.
4386920 4388400 Honey, we're gonna be late.
4388640 4394040 I'm just gonna take a couple laps<br />before I go down to the station.
4444320 4449080 Sam, take a hike.<br />No "Stooges" tonight. Go on!
4450120 4453320 He's sweet.
4469120 4470080 Get a beer, man.
4470320 4471520 Don't worry about it.
4471760 4473880 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4474120 4475360 I'm out.
4475600 4478520 Put some music on.
4485680 4488960 - Who's not accounted for?<br />- Riggs and Murtaugh.
4489200 4492120 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4492360 4494360 - What about Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in.
4494600 4496480 Get on the radio and find them!
4496720 4500600 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4500840 4504880 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4505120 4508080 Sorry, captain.
4513040 4515920 Get me Riggs.
4521320 4524200 I'll get that.
4537280 4542520 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.<br />And I was feeling real lucky.
4542760 4546800 Okay. So what I see are nice<br />conservative tax returns.
4547040 4550120 Everything by the book.<br />Everything black and white.
4550360 4552800 You have to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4553040 4554920 ...if you want to see some bucks.
4555160 4558480 Your salary's not much to work with.<br />You need deductions.
4558720 4560120 - My boat.<br />- Can't deduct it.
4560360 4564280 - No, it's the bill of sale.<br />- I know, but you can't deduct it.
4564520 4566120 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4566360 4567560 - Go where?<br />- To my house.
4567800 4569440 - For what?<br />- My boat, man.
4569680 4571360 Look at this commercial!
4571600 4574560 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4574800 4576960 What are you doing?<br />Look at the girl!
4577200 4578960 You hit the button...
4579200 4582400 - I didn't hear you say that.<br />- Say what? She's great.
4582640 4586920 She has a great body.<br />Makes me want to buy rubbers.
4594280 4598160 It's time for the<br />seventh-inning stretch.
4600720 4602440 That's a baseball expression.
4602680 4604560 I know.
4604800 4608720 But we're only up<br />to the fourth inning.
4612280 4615080 Batter up!
4622560 4624560 Stay in the car.
4624800 4627360 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4627600 4630360 I don't want to stay.<br />It's cold. You have no door.
4630600 4635760 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat if you're cold.
4637120 4638480 Don't touch anything.
4638720 4642200 Nothing. I mean nothing!
4643680 4645520 Alba Varden...
4645760 4647360 Why do I know the name?
4647600 4649960 It's here. It's gotta be.
4650200 4655200 {y:i}- Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, what's new?
4659720 4662440 The day on my boat.
4663440 4665600 Not there. Where is it?
4665840 4668760 My birthday.
4694640 4696200 I'll be damned.
4696440 4700360 "Alba Varden" is a ship, not a woman.
4700600 4703120 Leo, I told you to stay in the car.
4703360 4705840 Shit!
4707120 4710840 Son of a bitch,<br />what are you doing here?
4767400 4770320 Nailed them both.
4781880 4784800 My car.
4786040 4788840 Leo!
4843200 4844680 Get up, get dressed.
4844920 4845880 What is it?
4846120 4849280 Get dressed. Trust me.
4851920 4853520 - I don't understand.<br />- Trust me.
4853760 4856040 Something's wrong.<br />I got a bad feeling.
4856280 4859800 - I don't understand.<br />- Put this on.
4920000 4922800 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the seat.
4923040 4925800 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck.
4926040 4927960 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
4928200 4930360 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!
4930600 4933520 Stay out of the light.
4977120 4980280 Master race.
4999840 5002360 It's all right.
5005760 5008120 You shit! You shit!
5008360 5011720 - Who were those people?<br />- You tell me. Was it your husband?
5011960 5015080 What are you doing Saturday?
5023960 5026640 It's Sam!
5028520 5031720 Get your head down!
5046880 5048040 Come on, Sam!
5048280 5049720 Come on, Sam!
5049960 5051440 Come on, Sam.
5051680 5054640 - Shake a leg.<br />- Come on, boy.
5057800 5061080 Has he got any holes in him?
5061800 5065200 You clever dog!
5070640 5073240 I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.
5073480 5076120 This is the most<br />incredible first date.
5076360 5078160 Wait until the second.
5078400 5082040 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5082280 5084800 This is a nice building<br />you've got here.
5085040 5087360 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5087600 5090080 You can stay right here.
5090320 5091120 I can?
5091360 5095320 Yes, there's a vacant<br />apartment up there.
5096680 5099520 I was kidding. You can stay with me.
5099760 5100760 Tonight?
5101000 5104720 Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night<br />and the night after that.
5104960 5106760 And after that?
5107000 5110280 Don't push your luck.
5115120 5116800 I gotta go.
5117040 5120560 - But you said...<br />- Go inside and lock all the doors.
5120800 5123280 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5123520 5126520 There's better ways of staying<br />in L.A. Than that job.
5126760 5130440 All right. I've just quit.
5152960 5157080 I'll just grab a few things...<br />I forgot, I haven't got anything.
5157320 5160840 Just bring yourself.
5161840 5163440 I gotta go.
5163680 5166480 Bye.
5180640 5181840 Go home!
5182080 5184800 Go!
5196160 5199160 Go get the girl.
5218080 5221320 I was going to offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5221560 5222800 ...you're on the wagon.
5223040 5224800 That stuff will kill you quick.
5225040 5229280 You know so much about me,<br />who the hell are you?
5232040 5235360 I'm the guy that changed<br />the course of your life.
5235600 5237200 Four years ago...
5237440 5239720 ...when you was a narc<br />down at Long Beach...
5239960 5243080 ...you were getting too close.<br />We put a contract on you.
5243320 5245120 I handled it myself.
5245360 5248160 Drove your car off the road, remember?
5248400 5251240 But you weren't driving, were you?
5251480 5254040 You can't imagine the surprise.
5254280 5260480 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5260560 5263280 Your wife, right?
5264120 5267560 She didn't die straight away.
5267760 5270960 It took a bit of time.
5276200 5279800 Don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5406800 5408760 {y:i}She's dead. They killed her.
5409000 5410200 Where are you?
5410440 5412760 They killed her. She's dead.
5413000 5414440 They killed them both.
5414680 5418120 Slow down. Who are you<br />talking about? Where are you?
5418360 5422000 {y:i}She's dead, Roger. She's dead.
5422160 5426120 Just calm down. We'll take<br />care of it. Where are you?
5426360 5429760 I'm not a cop tonight.<br />It's personal. I'm not a cop.
5430000 5433640 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5433880 5438280 I'm gonna get those bastards<br />and fuck them! I'm going there now.
5438520 5442760 We're not going to the fucking<br />stilt house. We're under orders!
5443000 5445120 Then the stilt house will come to me.
5445360 5447720 You don't understand.<br />They killed them both.
5447960 5451800 - They got Rika and my wife.<br />{y:i}- Don't hang up!
5456080 5458880 Shit.
5470200 5472040 What's the deal?
5472280 5475040 You talk to the feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5475280 5477800 That's not fair.
5480200 5483240 We trusted you, Leo.
5483680 5486280 You betrayed us.
5486600 5489160 You took our money!
5491440 5496200 We want it back now,<br />you slimy little shit.
5496720 5500440 Give him some more.<br />He seems to like it.
5531480 5533440 Don't try and stop me.
5533680 5536720 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5536960 5540080 They declared war on the police.
5540320 5541840 You know about that?
5542080 5544720 I heard it on the radio.
5544960 5546880 We don't have the authority.
5547120 5548280 Cavanaugh...
5548520 5551920 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
5551920 5557280 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5557520 5560440 You got a plan?
5563200 5565680 If you drive around<br />the front of the house...
5565920 5568400 ...you wait for my signal...
5568640 5571280 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5571520 5574000 They got Leo.
5574880 5577600 Be careful.
5584560 5586680 What's your signal?
5586920 5590360 You'll know it when it happens.
5591520 5595400 Somehow I think I will know.
5625240 5628000 Payday.
5639760 5642920 Feel like talking, Leo?
5646400 5649000 It's the big one!
5651920 5652920 All right. Cool it.
5653160 5656960 - Watch him.<br />- Move me away from the windows!
5687520 5688440 Watch the glass!
5688680 5691200 - Come on!<br />- I'll go.
5723720 5727400 Riggs, you crazy mother...
5741840 5745080 Holy Christ!
5747560 5748680 You all right?
5748920 5749880 I'm okay.
5750120 5751960 Thanks.
5752200 5754960 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
5755200 5757040 - I'm gonna find him.<br />- What about Leo?
5757280 5758320 What about Leo?
5758560 5760400 You're on your own now, Leo.
5760640 5762000 What do you mean?
5762240 5765520 Take my car to the station<br />and wait for the federal marshal.
5765760 5769400 It's been an experience knowing you.
5772080 5774960 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Give the little fellow a hug.
5775200 5777320 I had a lot of fun.
5777560 5779160 You do your duty now.
5779400 5781560 Don't worry.<br />I'll really get them now.
5781800 5784080 - Listen! Wait!<br />- You know how to find him.
5784320 5787800 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5788760 5789960 Loud as you want.
5790200 5791160 Really?
5791400 5795080 - Okay. Really?<br />- Bye, Leo.
5798160 5799520 {y:i}Check it out.
5799760 5803080 {y:i}The "Alba Varden" is<br />{y:i}a cargo ship, not a woman.
5803320 5806640 {y:i}The Port Authority said that<br />{y:i}the "Alba Varden" arrived today...
5806880 5811120 {y:i}... and heads out tomorrow<br />{y:i}to South Africa.
5811640 5813440 This is the 11th dock.
5813680 5818040 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
5821600 5822440 The ship.
5822680 5825600 What did I tell you?
5825840 5828440 That container there,<br />with three heavy hitters.
5828680 5831240 Let's have a look.
5831520 5835240 I'll take two of them out.<br />You take one.
5835400 5840680 Better yet, you take two,<br />I'll take one. Pull over.
5884720 5885760 I can't see shit.
5886000 5887760 Me either. What is this shit?
5888000 5890960 Got a light?
5891000 5893000 It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.
5893240 5896840 I still can't see shit.
5897120 5901800 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5905240 5909120 Holy shit. Fort Knox!
5910760 5914160 Hell, how much is it?
5914280 5917200 Thousands.
5917200 5919160 Fucking millions!
5919400 5923480 Billions!<br />A fucking Donald Trump lotto!
5931760 5933200 Look at this.
5933440 5937120 These are thousand-dollar bills.
5937280 5942320 With what I'm holding, I could put<br />all three of my kids through college.
5942560 5945040 Take it.
5950840 5952240 Fucking drug money.
5952480 5954040 Do something good with it.
5954160 5958240 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
5968440 5970160 Load the container.
5970400 5975400 Next time the sun hits their bodies,<br />they'll be in Cape Town.
5977800 5980520 - This thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
5980760 5983640 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
5983880 5985240 Let's shoot our way out.
5985480 5988880 Don't do that. I got a better idea.
6039760 6042680 Our money.
6044080 6047800 Just make sure they're dead.
6056640 6061640 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- No, you go first. I'll cover you.
6074840 6076960 - How do we get out?<br />- I'm going this way.
6077200 6080840 I'll go this way.<br />I'll check over here.
6096560 6098480 Rog!
6098720 6101280 Rog!
6153520 6156080 Shit!
6278520 6281720 Riggs, you okay?
6296320 6298960 Drop it, asshole!
6303400 6307440 Diplomatic immunity!
6315800 6319760 It's just been revoked.
6392880 6395920 You're breathing. You're alive.<br />You're not dead.
6396160 6398640 No, don't die.
6398880 6401400 You're not dead until I tell you.
6401640 6405400 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6405640 6407160 You got that, Riggs?
6407400 6410160 You're not dead until I tell you.
6410400 6412320 Now breathe with me. Breathe.
6412560 6415600 - Now, breathe.<br />- Hey, Rog.
6419080 6422800 Rog, in my pocket.
6428760 6431720 I want you to throw those things away.
6431960 6436000 Those things will kill you. Really.
6440280 6443240 You son of a bitch!
6443480 6445080 I thought you were dying.
6445320 6448360 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not dying in your arms.
6448600 6451600 You son of a bitch.
6454960 6458360 Are they all gone? The bad guys?<br />Did you get them?
6458600 6462280 They been "de-kaffirnated".
6469200 6473320 Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.
6474240 6477800 Did anyone ever tell you...
6478400 6482320 ...you really are a beautiful man?
6485160 6488480 Give us a kiss before they come.
6489040 6492640 Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?
6495640 6498640 Don't make me laugh!
