28403 31197 God! I love this job! Man!<br />Can't you go any faster?
31448 32490 Floor this thing!
32699 35160 It's my wife's. I won't go faster.
35368 36703 You're doing 65 now.
36911 38496 65?! Shit!
38788 41624 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
44419 49549 We're eastbound on 4th, in pursuit of<br />a red BMW, driver Caucasian, blonde.
49924 52427 Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.
54346 57807 You are westbound on 2nd.<br />20 William 12 is southbound.
58141 61561 You're heading straight<br />toward each other.
61811 64064 - Somebody back off.<br />- Got it.
64356 66858 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
86836 91007 Go! We'll stick with the red bastard.<br />You chase the blue.
91299 95136 That's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
95387 99641 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20 William 15 and 20 William 12.
100266 102310 - That's Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And their squad.
102519 105105 - $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
105313 106981 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
107190 110318 I knew nothing about the wagon.<br />Bet's off.
110610 111820 Shut up!
121579 122997 What the hell is that?
123206 125750 What fuckin' language is that?
126001 127293 It's German.
127544 128712 Japanese?
128962 132090 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.
132382 133466 They own everything.
139514 140974 Shotgun!
150191 152027 Shots are being fired.
152610 154362 Thanks for the scoop.
154696 157282 The bastard shot my wife's windshield.
157657 159034 Entering the pursuit.
172964 175884 Oh, shit, man! We're splitting up!
180388 182807 Son-of-a-bitch! Now we're cooking.
187020 188021 Step on it!
201659 202827 Look out!
210210 211419 See you!
233441 236486 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
252794 255422 We got one. Yours is going up the hill.
255630 257007 So is Riggs, on foot!
261011 264097 Hey, Riggs! Get your slow ass in here!
264472 266182 Get in here, now!
266558 267726 Only if I drive.
267934 269644 Move over. I'll drive.
269853 272313 No, go around. I'm driving.
272564 274649 I'll drive.
275775 277861 Did you get a make on that red Beemer?
278653 280238 Not one scratch, you hear?
285618 287328 - You won't make it.<br />- I will.
287537 288788 There's not enough room!
289122 290832 You're not going to make it!
291958 294044 Look at my side panel!
304929 307432 Goddamn it, you were right.
307974 309976 There wasn't enough room.
375375 376793 He's turning right!
386511 387887 Get out of the way!
403903 405530 This was a new car, Riggs.
405989 407198 Well, it still is.
415040 416249 On three.
416958 418084 One...
418752 420670 ...two... three!
422255 423631 Shit!
425300 427302 You forgot to turn your indicator on.
427552 430305 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
430513 433558 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamnit!
433850 435352 Me?! Where did he go?!
435560 438355 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
438605 441691 - You're supposed to come on "three".<br />- I thought you meant, "three" then go!
441900 443777 No! We always go on "three"!
443985 447113 Sometimes we go, "one, two, three,"<br />then go!
448490 449824 Go check back there!
450075 454245 If you see anybody running out,<br />just pump the shit out of them.
455246 456706 What was that?
458708 461294 - He crawled into the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
468176 469886 Holy Christ!
470553 472097 That's a lot of money.
478895 480605 It's gold!
481231 482440 Gold!
482732 483900 Krugerrands.
484109 487070 It's illegal. You can't import them<br />into the country.
487404 488571 You're right.
488822 492534 The damage you caused is coming<br />out of the department's budget.
492826 496955 - Pay it in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
497247 499249 I want an explanation.
499541 503420 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said this was a routine bust.
503712 508800 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
509175 511219 This was bigger than we thought.
511761 513138 Talk to you later.
519936 523064 I worked psycho ward.<br />You'll never get out.
524482 526901 One minute, fifteen seconds.
527235 529154 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
530572 535368 Hey! What's going on? Is this<br />kindergarten or a police station?
535869 537328 Get some work done.
538038 540790 Houdini Jr. Bets he can free himself<br />in 5 minutes.
541082 542125 I will too.
547589 549758 Don't try this at home, kids.
560143 564773 It's over now. Put your money<br />on the desk and get back to work.
567192 568651 Suckers.
575158 577452 How the hell did you do that?
579079 583041 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />Now I can do it whenever I want.
583249 584751 Doesn't it hurt?
585126 587087 Yeah, it does.
587879 590924 But not as much as...<br />when I put it back in.
602686 604688 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
605188 607440 My door is always open, Sergeant.
608775 612487 We should keep this<br />on a professional level.
613697 616658 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
616950 619953 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
620245 621788 And I need the money.
621996 622914 Cough up!
625709 628670 It's not all here yet. I want it all.
636136 638179 Where did this come from?
638930 643977 You can't help yourself to this stuff!<br />It's evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
644477 647022 - It's mine. I won it.<br />- It's not yours.
647397 649482 You want to get busted?
651276 653361 Want to get something to eat?
653653 655196 Not tonight.
655572 657991 - Rianne's commercial is on.<br />- She's in a commercial?
658241 659951 Not so loud!
660160 663121 What's wrong?<br />I'd be proud if I was you.
663997 667292 I haven't seen it yet.<br />What if she stinks?
667584 670170 You got to be kidding. She'll be great.
670503 671546 Listen up!
672797 674924 Tonight at... what time?
675300 676176 Come on!
676509 677886 What time?
678762 679679 Eight.
679971 681639 Eight o'clock, on... channel?
684267 688605 Eight. The Sergeant's daughter, Rianne.<br />Here's a picture of her.
690357 693651 She's going to make<br />her television debut in a commercial.
700450 703411 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
719302 722931 What happened? This is a new car.<br />Mom's going to be upset!
723223 726017 - It's still new.<br />- No, it's not, it's wrecked.
726267 728812 I don't want your mother to know.
730021 731940 Do your homework too.
732190 735193 - Hey! I haven' t read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
735402 737737 Why don't you look out for me?
738029 742283 Hey, Ricky! I want to use my driveway<br />once in a while.
742909 744828 Nice oxygen tent.
745036 748623 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
748998 753378 This is a two-car garage,<br />and this is my hobby room upstairs.
753670 758341 I retire when I'm 52, the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
758633 760510 You're not retiring, are you?
760802 763763 - I've thought of it, since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
764097 767684 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
770979 771771 Jesus!
772272 773690 What's wrong with you?
774607 776568 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
776818 779154 You're sorry? Check my shorts!
779946 782532 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
784451 788121 Easy. It's no Saturday Night Special,<br />for crying out loud.
790040 791583 Give it back.
793793 795920 A man's not even safe in his own home.
796212 797839 Then stay the hell out of here.
798715 800467 You got any traffic warrants?
800759 802010 Can you fix them?
809517 811936 Almost time. Are we taping this?
812228 815273 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
815523 816941 Take the stairs.
817150 820445 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
820653 823782 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
824074 825575 I want you to look good.
825784 826493 Unplug it.
826743 828036 That's your sister!
828495 829746 Picture's perfect.
829954 830580 Yeah?
832332 833291 Do I know you?
833958 834626 Yes, sir.
835251 837879 We had a long talk about a week ago.
838129 839255 About what?
839547 841174 Your new hobby room.
841466 843176 This is George.
846221 848223 Did you sense that I liked you?
849474 850684 Yes, sir.
851601 853436 Sit down and be quiet.
856940 860235 - What are you eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
860485 861444 Tuna?
862070 863947 You can't eat tuna!
864406 865949 Dad killed Flipper.
866157 867867 We're boycotting tuna...
868159 872288 ...because they kill the dolphins<br />that get caught in the nets.
872956 874082 Have ham.
874332 875667 Eat Miss Piggy.
876835 879254 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
884426 886511 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
889472 890765 My baby!
891891 894519 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
903778 905488 When the time has come...
906239 908324 ...and the moment is right...
909367 910577 ...remember...
911119 913538 ...use Ramses' Extra condoms.
915165 917042 - We do!<br />- Ramses' Extra.
917834 921212 Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.
930930 932474 Take the kids upstairs.
933433 935268 We learn this in Human Development.
935560 938313 In Human what?!<br />Human Development what?!
938521 940065 Chill out, Daddy.
940315 941733 Upstairs!
941983 943568 Nick, upstairs.
944110 946363 You know how your father is.
946613 949282 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
951659 953078 Home. Out!
953912 954996 I got a gun.
960669 963129 What? She looked beautiful.
963380 966883 I liked it. She made me want to buy<br />rubbers right now.
974349 977644 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was...
978603 981022 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
981314 983650 I think she's got a hell of a future.
984442 986361 George is afraid. He's going home.
986611 987862 Stick around.
988279 989739 He has a gun.
990031 993326 It's an old gun<br />and he's not a very good shot.
994202 996871 That's good. I'm going anyway.<br />Good night.
997163 999874 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- You let him buy it.
1000125 1003211 You're under 21. Be back by midnight.
1004504 1006965 Wait and see. Cops never let up.
1007257 1011386 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />rubbers in the mail, in the coffee...
1011636 1016266 If you'd only kept your mouth shut!<br />I'm going for a walk.
1016516 1019644 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
1033199 1035618 How goes it with you, Hans?
1035827 1038079 Okay. You, Pieter?
1039122 1042208 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1044336 1047464 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having painting done.
1048840 1050675 The important thing is...
1050925 1051968 ...are you okay?
1052344 1054220 No bones broken?
1054763 1056139 I'm fine, thanks.
1056931 1058433 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1059100 1060518 Yeah, that's all.
1060769 1062187 Good, good.
1065899 1068985 However, we lost over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1070403 1073698 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1074366 1075617 It happens.
1075992 1077911 It's not your fault.
1078244 1081373 Sometimes things do not go as planned.
1082248 1085835 As you say, they just happen,<br />Eh, Pieter?
1094344 1097639 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word, "drop cloth."
1099391 1102852 Certain policemen have become<br />an intolerable nuisance.
1103478 1108149 They are obviously on to us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1108525 1109901 Warn them off.
1111820 1113571 It's my experience...
1114030 1117492 ...that a scared cop<br />is more useful than a dead one.
1117742 1118952 A warning?
1119577 1121371 Is that not a bit tame?
1121830 1123289 Depends on how you do it.
1125375 1127377 Then you better look at this.
1134092 1137554 This is the policeman in charge.
1140265 1141516 A Kaffir.
1143309 1144519 Lovely.
1145729 1147439 Remember to take these in order.
1148356 1151317 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1153319 1154779 This yours?
1155488 1157240 I found it in the wash.
1164122 1165749 I keep losing this.
1166958 1168251 Something's wrong.
1168626 1172172 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1175258 1176676 What about the pen?
1177218 1179137 It reminds me of something.
1180180 1181473 Of what?
1182098 1183850 It reminds me of...
1184184 1186102 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1187312 1188813 I didn't mean to push.
1190273 1193193 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1198448 1203119 I was to meet her for dinner.<br />One of those romantic dinners for two.
1203411 1204662 I had so much work.
1207248 1209125 And I forgot about it.
1210794 1215131 She waited at the restaurant<br />for an hour before she drove home.
1217008 1221346 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone. I answered it.
1221596 1224182 They said she was killed in a car crash.
1229938 1233066 If I'd been driving,<br />we'd have been all right.
1235860 1240031 I remember falling down<br />on my knees and shaking all over.
1240365 1243159 I remember thinking, "I'm losing it."
1244369 1246830 There I was lying on the floor...
1248373 1252585 ...and I'm seeing under the couch,<br />and I see this gold pen.
1254045 1258967 Just lying there. I'd been looking<br />for it for two months. There it is.
1260885 1262971 She wasn't a great housekeeper.
1264723 1268601 This voice goes off in my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1269602 1272022 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1273606 1278111 I didn't feel like it, but I got up.<br />Muscles were still working.
1278653 1281197 Then I drove to the hospital...
1281531 1284826 ...identified her, signed her out<br />with my gold pen.
1285076 1287495 Trish found a gold pen in the laundry.
1298131 1300383 Look around you, Sam.
1302135 1303678 One day, Sam...
1304763 1306473 ...this'll all be yours.
1310226 1313438 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1314314 1316733 A man could be happy here.
1321112 1325241 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you get piles?
1325533 1327202 Let's go watch TV.
1420170 1421463 Kaffirs!
1425133 1426760 Wondering about your kids?
1427886 1430138 About what we've done to them?
1431139 1433767 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1434976 1437228 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1438355 1440065 Want to know what we've done?
1440690 1441608 Shall I tell you?
1443735 1446571 Just let your imagination run wild.
1447322 1449324 This has just been a warning.
1449657 1453453 After this, it gets bloody.<br />Tell your people to back off.
1453828 1455663 Don't be a smart Kaffir.
1456247 1457999 Maybe we let you live, huh?
1479729 1482857 - You didn't see a face?<br />- Not one. They had on hoods.
1483233 1484567 What about a voice?
1484776 1489489 That crazy motherfucker who did talk<br />had a strange accent.
1489823 1494703 Not German, not English.<br />Kind of guttural. Really shitty accent.
1494994 1498456 Wait. Anything like what we chased<br />the other night?
1498873 1501292 Yeah, kind of like that.
1501668 1503211 Trish and the kids?
1503420 1506464 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1506715 1511052 Listen up! You heard what happened<br />to Rog last night?
1511594 1513638 Forensics get back with anything?
1513930 1516016 Not yet. They'll keep us posted.
1516391 1519853 We got to watch each other's<br />backs and fronts.
1520103 1524107 You can all watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1524399 1527318 - Lf we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1533324 1535910 I got something special for you.
1536286 1539414 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1539706 1543501 You guys are going to baby-sit<br />until Washington sends the Feds.
1543877 1547213 - How long?<br />- Until the red tape is processed.
1547297 1548715 Couple, three days.
1548965 1553303 Getz is going to testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1553595 1555680 Drugs, laundered money, etc.
1556264 1557223 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1559934 1561686 This is not a shit assignment.
1562020 1563938 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1564397 1565148 It isn't.
1565482 1566399 It is.
1566733 1568651 Shut up, both of you.
1569778 1571529 I've guaranteed his safety.
1571780 1572364 Why us?
1572655 1575950 You two are the most qualified. And...
1576242 1579329 ...after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1579579 1580914 I can handle last night.
1582123 1583541 What do we do with him?
1583750 1585335 Take him to Disneyland.
1586211 1588213 This stinks. This stinks.
1588463 1593134 I don't give a fuck! I don't have an<br />ulcer because I know when to say that.
1593426 1595011 Here's where he's staying.
1595261 1599724 A nice hotel. The Justice Department<br />is paying. Enjoy yourselves.
1600892 1602310 One more thing.
1605355 1606523 Know what that says?
1606898 1609693 Yeah. Same thing as that,<br />but I don't give a fuck.
1613863 1616658 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1628461 1630088 What room is that for?
1630463 1631339 612.
1634134 1636177 This is it. 612.
1639681 1640390 Police.
1641266 1642434 How do I know that?
1642934 1646479 After I shoot you, you can<br />examine the bullet. Open up.
1648481 1650734 Don't you want to see a badge?
1650984 1652527 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1652736 1655155 I get it. Bad cop, good cop.
1655447 1656823 Shut up.
1658116 1660660 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1660910 1663955 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1664205 1667834 Whatever you need, Leo gets. Get it?
1668376 1671338 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1671629 1673840 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh, this is Sgt. Riggs.
1674049 1677093 Nice to meet you.<br />So what do I call you guys?
1677344 1678720 Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
1678928 1680847 We're going to be your shadow.
1683099 1685185 That's fine. Hey, an old-fashioned...
1686770 1689939 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1690231 1692650 I didn't think anyone used them anymore.
1693276 1696571 I bet the kid's got an automatic.<br />Have you?
1696863 1697947 Yep, a Beretta.
1700408 1701910 You sure you guys are cops?
1702952 1705914 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm a state witness.
1706164 1706873 Star witness.
1708583 1710210 We'll take that room.
1711169 1713713 I already have my stuff in this room.
1721805 1726142 It's yours, okay?<br />I'll move it in the small room.
1726476 1729979 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1730313 1734651 Hey, loosen up, guys!<br />We're going to be together a long time.
1735610 1736403 I'll get it.
1737987 1739614 It's only room service.
1740407 1743368 You hungry? I'll call<br />for anything you want.
1743660 1745537 See this silk robe? Free.
1746246 1748039 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is.
1748331 1751459 - It's taxpayers' money.<br />- Same thing.
1755380 1756756 Morning, gentlemen.
1760927 1764764 That's my food. You guys<br />didn't want anything. Bring it here.
1765640 1766850 It's mine.
1767726 1769561 You could have had something.
1770854 1772689 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1779112 1780655 Not the window!
1783700 1784743 Shit!
1811561 1813104 Where is that son-of-a-bitch?
1814981 1817859 Somebody stop that guy! Stop him!
1819736 1822697 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1829120 1833917 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back!
1834334 1836753 Clear! Get back! Police!
1838171 1839172 You okay?
1839381 1842175 Where were you?<br />Why didn't you follow me?
1842467 1844803 - Yeah, why didn't you?<br />- I was 7 floors up!
1846805 1848264 - He hit me.<br />- Good!
1850850 1856022 This guy took a big chance to pop all of<br />us. What'd you witness, a murder?
1856272 1858400 Nothing like that. Honest.
1861111 1865740 All I did was launder a half a billion<br />dollars in drug money.
1866866 1868952 Half a billion dollars?!
1869285 1872956 More or less.<br />Who can count that much money?
1873289 1876835 Could I have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1877293 1879045 Could you shut the fuck up?
1879754 1881464 You're supposed to take care of me.
1881840 1882716 Shut up!
1884092 1887721 Mr. Getz got away.<br />Our best opportunity and he gets away.
1888096 1892767 He slips through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1893643 1894978 What are you doing?
1895937 1899399 Checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1900275 1901985 Okay, I got it.
1902861 1906364 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1906698 1909451 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1909659 1911036 Bring it to you.
1912537 1915582 - He does.<br />- I don't understand. Why me?
1915874 1917250 Who am I?
1919336 1921838 You're a courier. You work for him.
1922130 1923506 I'm the drug dealer.
1927218 1930972 Don't you have plates? What is this?
1933224 1937937 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1939230 1940732 I issue you a cashier's check...
1941316 1945320 ...in his name,<br />minus a small commission for myself.
1946112 1947364 - The other end.<br />- You like breathing?
1947572 1948615 How much?
1948907 1949991 2%.
1950700 1953328 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1955955 1959250 You return it to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1959584 1963213 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1963505 1964547 How's that work?
1964923 1967425 That's it! Don't you get it?
1967759 1971763 It's your money. You don't pay it back.<br />And it's clean.
1972097 1974391 It is now laundered.
1975934 1977852 You cops aren't too bright.
1980105 1982357 This is the best part.
1983066 1986027 You take a tax deduction...
1986653 1990115 ...on interest payments<br />you don't even make.
1991700 1994035 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1994327 1995328 Cheat.
1995787 1997038 Come on!
1997706 2001835 Everyone cheats. Look at the Pentagon.<br />So you got it?
2003962 2007007 So how come you turned yourself in,<br />Mr. Big Shot?
2007590 2009926 I was scamming those guys for months.
2010385 2012470 Every transaction, I kept a little.
2012762 2013596 You?
2014222 2016474 It was easy. Cash deposits...
2016766 2020228 ...millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
2020478 2023648 Who's going to miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
2024566 2025316 Drug dealers.
2026735 2028486 That's right. They did.
2028820 2031531 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
2034200 2035869 You can give that to Nick.
2036661 2039789 But it's softer.<br />I put a fabric softener in there.
2040081 2041124 It's small, Leroy.
2041332 2045712 It's Leo, not Leroy.<br />I'll buy you another shirt.
2045962 2048840 Just give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
2049090 2050842 I don't know any.
2051092 2053178 I just dealt with the couriers.
2053470 2055388 Where does Trish keep my laundry?
2055597 2057515 Behind the machine.
2059100 2061519 You never met anyone except couriers?
2063104 2064773 No names.
2068151 2072822 Wait a minute, come to think of it!<br />Okay, listen.
2073198 2076826 They took me up in the hills<br />to a house on stilts.
2077369 2080497 And I had a job interview with a guy...
2080789 2082832 ...and his name was...
2083792 2085335 Haynes! Hans!
2085627 2087962 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2088338 2090215 It won't hurt to look.
2090590 2091549 I know the address.
2091758 2092550 Let's go.
2092842 2093885 We shouldn't do this!
2094344 2096304 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2096680 2099265 We're back! You're black, I'm mad.
2099474 2101184 This is going to be great!
2101559 2104479 If we're going, shouldn't I have a gun?
2107273 2109693 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2109984 2111736 Sorry about that.
2116533 2118451 It should be coming up soon.
2118868 2121287 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2121579 2125125 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility, Leo.
2125417 2128586 That's it. Nine.<br />My lucky number. Nine.
2128878 2130964 Stay in the car.
2132382 2134259 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2136553 2137929 Nice car.
2138513 2140432 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2140724 2142809 You're not being careful!
2143101 2145645 I know what I'm doing. It's a car...
2145812 2147230 ...not a baby carriage.
2147480 2149816 You're chipping the paint.
2150984 2153945 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell it.
2154195 2155655 A rat?
2156281 2158158 A real stinky one.
2161953 2163204 Where you going?
2163496 2167917 I'm a peeping Tom. It goes<br />with the badge. It's fun sometimes.
2170295 2171004 Bingo!
2175425 2177135 Lars, look!
2177427 2178511 What the fuck?!
2184225 2185518 Where's the pool?
2185769 2186478 No pool.
2186895 2190106 - Of course there is.<br />- This house is built on stilts.
2190315 2192567 I'm sure there's a pool.
2204788 2206247 Cuff yourselves.
2235235 2236653 Move that truck!
2238321 2239531 Your keys!
2241991 2243243 You all right?
2244119 2245245 Where you going?
2245453 2246996 That was the waiter from the hotel.
2247163 2248289 Wait for me!
2248623 2250125 Get the fuck out of here!
2250375 2253169 What are you doing?!<br />You can't take my truck!
2268309 2270854 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2271021 2272397 Where did he go?
2272814 2275233 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2275442 2278903 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2279612 2282198 Get back! It's police business!
2282574 2285160 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2305347 2308141 I love it! We got to catch him!
2324407 2325992 Hello, asshole.
2358191 2359275 Give me that!
2376167 2378753 There they are! Hurry up!
2379045 2380839 Can't you go faster?!
2381131 2383383 Will you shut the fuck up?
2464297 2466716 Wipe out. It's under control.
2466883 2468968 I told you to look out!
2471596 2474349 - You're too old for this.<br />- Shut up! Yak-yak-yak.
2474557 2475642 And stay!
2475934 2478019 What do you think I am, a dog?
2492867 2494536 Hands behind your neck!
2499666 2503128 What are you guys doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2503545 2504170 What is going on?
2504921 2505588 Freeze!
2506965 2508008 Get down here!
2508174 2509926 Come on, it's been a bad day.
2510385 2511469 Show me your hands.
2511845 2515306 Take it easy, officer. I'm not armed.
2516016 2517684 I won't resist.
2518435 2522731 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right. Do as I say!
2528278 2529320 Hands on your head.
2530280 2531948 Behind your head!
2532282 2534117 You have no idea what you're doing.
2534784 2538955 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2539414 2541499 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2541750 2546212 I'm Minister of Diplomatic Affairs<br />for the South African consulate.
2547255 2549507 South Africa. Home of the Krugerrand.
2549758 2551426 Among other things.
2551676 2554262 These men also work for the consulate.
2554637 2556389 We have diplomatic credentials...
2559142 2560977 Keep your hands out of there.
2569694 2572822 Everybody, take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2573073 2574115 Riggs?
2574657 2576034 You're Martin Riggs?
2576368 2579496 From Chicago. What's your name?<br />What's his name?
2580038 2581414 Pieter Von... Vor...
2581581 2583625 I'll just call you Adolf.
2584376 2588713 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?<br />That's you.
2589547 2590924 It's official.
2592300 2593593 They are official.
2594594 2597013 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2597263 2600892 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2601184 2604312 ...once his identity<br />has been established.
2606314 2609776 We have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2610110 2613863 ...which I will take up<br />with your State Department tomorrow.
2614114 2617367 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2618493 2620370 My dear officer...
2621454 2624374 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2627168 2629587 Who is the dickhead now, huh?
2633425 2638471 The South African government owns<br />this house. This is South African soil.
2638930 2640682 Now get out of here.
2642017 2643226 All of you.
2652235 2653945 Don't do it.
2654237 2658408 Don't do it or I'll make you<br />eat this fucking thing.
2661286 2662495 Kaffir.
2672047 2675342 Could you step out of the car, please?
2677469 2679888 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2681723 2683224 Sorry. Are you okay?
2685268 2686311 Don't open that.
2687354 2689105 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2689397 2693276 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2693568 2695653 Is he serious with this stuff?
2697280 2701951 These are police officers, Miss<br />Van den Haas. They were just leaving.
2704704 2706748 She is a consulate secretary.
2707707 2709626 Give her back the briefcase.
2712420 2714089 Give it to her.
2716424 2719010 I'm sorry, Miss Consulate Secretary.
2721054 2722764 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2723014 2725809 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2726101 2728853 Want to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2736361 2738780 I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2748540 2750417 It's the Triangle Trade again.
2750959 2756006 Don't you know American history?<br />Molasses to rum to slaves.
2756297 2758550 Now drugs to dollars to Krugerrands.
2758800 2762721 I got a dead guy with a surfboard<br />where his face used to be...
2762971 2766433 ...and the State Department<br />breathing down our throats.
2766725 2771396 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African consulate.
2771646 2775442 Apologize? He's a sack of shit!<br />He's a crook.
2775650 2778445 It doesn't matter. He's a diplomat.
2778737 2783158 He has immunity. We can't touch him,<br />arrest him, prosecute him.
2783408 2786703 - Does that spell it out for you?<br />- Yes, sir.
2786953 2790290 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you.
2792876 2797630 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />One you're supposed to be protecting!
2797881 2798882 He's alive, isn't he?
2799090 2802719 I signed a waiver.<br />Besides, I usually wait in the car.
2802969 2804721 Usually?
2805055 2807307 They're very adamant about that.
2807599 2809768 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops!
2810060 2813229 They're the best.<br />One time, a guy was waiving a gun...!
2813605 2814898 What did he say?
2817233 2818401 What did he say?
2818651 2820278 - "I don't give a fuck."<br />- What's that mean?
2820487 2824366 It's his mantra. Why is everyone<br />parked on my desk? Up!
2825784 2827494 It's a rubber plant!
2827786 2830622 It looks to be about a week's supply.
2830914 2831956 Go spit.
2832207 2835335 I forgot. You're too old for that shit.
2838129 2840882 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2865615 2867867 One moment, Miss Van den Haas.
2872372 2875500 I hope you understood<br />what happened here today.
2875875 2879004 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2879337 2881589 Why don't you explain it to me?
2881965 2886386 The policies of our government<br />are not popular here in America.
2887095 2890765 The police department here<br />is overrun with blacks.
2891349 2894477 They have badges and guns<br />and they hate us.
2895353 2897605 Our consulate, its staff...
2897897 2902318 ...and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2924049 2926217 Things are getting out of hand.
2926509 2931806 There are too many losses. We'll<br />move the cash in one large shipment.
2932057 2934434 We'll need more than a suitcase.
2934684 2938646 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2939105 2941691 Your warning did not work.
2949949 2951868 - Let's go, Leo!<br />- I'm coming.
2952243 2954662 Come on! Move!
2955038 2957248 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2957457 2958833 I've got to eat, too.
2961252 2962962 Give me the food.
2968343 2970428 Who ordered the super combo?
2972055 2973807 I get a steak sandwich.
2974099 2975141 Who gets Leo?
2975392 2979896 You got a big empty house. I got<br />a trailer. What will I do with him?
2980188 2982607 My place is too small. You take him.
2982857 2984234 I had him last night.
2984526 2986152 Excuse me, fellows.
2987112 2989447 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2989739 2992534 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.
2993451 2996746 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- I just said that!
2997122 2999374 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2999666 3001376 We're not going back! Shut up!
3001626 3004587 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back!
3004879 3008049 Let me give you<br />a friendly piece of advice.
3008425 3012554 Never go through the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
3012762 3014514 Let me tell you why.
3014848 3018435 They fuck you at the drive-through!
3018685 3022856 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
3023148 3025734 You won't turn around and come back.
3025984 3028611 So who gets fucked? Leo Getz.
3028862 3030530 I'm not eating this tuna!
3031197 3032615 Shut up!!
3110694 3112445 Get rid of that man.
3115573 3119077 You're going to have<br />to leave the premises right now.
3129170 3130755 The morning faxes.
3169502 3172797 What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3173798 3176051 I want you to bite Leo for me.
3188104 3189522 What are you doing?
