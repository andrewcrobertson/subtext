275593 277222 -You won't make it.<br />-l will.
277430 278625 There's not enough room!
278934 280597 You're not going to make it!
281673 283667 Look at my side panel!
294136 296539 Goddamn it, you were right.
297042 298979 There wasn't enough room.
361790 363123 He's turning right!
372481 373814 Get out of the way!
389187 390747 This was a new car, Riggs.
391192 392353 Well, it still is.

414745 417650 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamnit!
417919 419388 Me?! Where did he go?!

422496 425469 -You're supposed to come on ''three''.<br />-l thought you meant, ''three'' then go!
425670 427470 No! We always go on ''three''!
427675 430671 Sometimes we go, ''one, two, three,''<br />then go!
431985 433284 Go check back there!
433521 437520 lf you see anybody running out,<br />just pump the shit out of them.
438467 439868 What was that?
441807 444301 -He crawled into the trunk.<br />-l got you covered.
450895 452558 Holy Christ!
453167 454659 That's a lot of money.
461185 462849 lt's gold!
463424 464586 Gold!
464860 465988 Krugerrands.
466197 469034 lt's illegal. You can't import them<br />into the country.
469371 470464 You're right.
470707 474306 The damage you caused is coming<br />out of the department's budget.
474550 478548 -Pay it in Krugerrands.<br />-Don't make jokes, make arrests.
478826 480729 l want an explanation.
480997 484733 -Things got out of hand.<br />-You said this was a routine bust.
485006 489916 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
490252 492246 This was bigger than we thought.
492757 494090 Talk to you later.
500610 503605 l worked psycho ward.<br />You'll never get out.
504952 507287 One minute, fifteen seconds.
507626 509459 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
510799 515401 Hey! What's going on? ls this<br />kindergarten or a police station?
515911 517312 Get some work done.
517982 520648 Houdini Jr. bets he can free himself<br />in 5 minutes.
520923 521891 l will too.
527170 529232 Don't try this at home, kids.
539232 543640 lt's over now. Put your money<br />on the desk and get back to work.
545980 547381 Suckers.
553631 555829 How the hell did you do that?
557406 561211 l dislocated my shoulder once.<br />Now l can do it whenever l want.
561415 562850 Doesn't it hurt?
563186 565088 Yeah, it does.
565859 568764 But not as much as...<br />when l put it back in.
580059 581995 lf it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
582464 584628 My door is always open, Sergeant.
585905 589471 We should keep this<br />on a professional level.
590649 593486 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
593756 596661 Who else could l do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
596931 598399 And l need the money.
598601 599500 Cough up!
602175 605012 lt's not all here yet. l want it all.
612198 614135 Where did this come from?
614872 619713 You can't help yourself to this stuff!<br />lt's evidence. lt's a Krugerrand.
620217 622654 -lt's mine. l won it.<br />-lt's not yours.
622990 624984 You want to get busted?
626732 628726 Want to get something to eat?
629004 630496 Not tonight.
630842 633177 -Rianne's commercial is on.<br />-She's in a commercial?
633414 635043 Not so loud!
635251 638088 What's wrong?<br />l'd be proud if l was you.
638927 642094 l haven't seen it yet.<br />What if she stinks?
642367 644862 You got to be kidding. She'll be great.
645208 646176 Listen up!
647379 649441 Tonight at...what time?
649785 650616 Come on!
650955 652287 What time?
653125 653991 Eight.
654295 655889 Eight o'clock, on...channel?
658404 662574 Eight. The Sergeant's daughter, Rianne.<br />Here's a picture of her.
664252 667419 She's going to make<br />her television debut in a commercial .
673940 676777 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
692049 695546 What happened? This is a new car.<br />Mom's going to be upset!
695824 698489 -lt's still new.<br />-No, it's not, it's wrecked.
698731 701168 l don't want your mother to know.
702339 704173 Do your homework too.
704410 707315 -Hey! l haven' t read these.<br />-Rianne put them there.
707517 709750 Why don't you look out for me?
710023 714125 Hey, Ricky! l want to use my driveway<br />once in a while.
714700 716568 Nice oxygen tent.
716772 720213 -Do l look like Michael Jackson?<br />-No, but you're bad.
720547 724784 This is a two-car garage,<br />and this is my hobby room upstairs.
725058 729558 l retire when l'm 52, the whole<br />nine yards kick in when l'm 55.
729802 731635 You're not retiring, are you?
731907 734743 -l've thought of it, since l met you.<br />-Thank you.
735048 738510 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
741662 742425 Jesus!
742932 744265 What's wrong with you?
745171 747038 l'm sorry. That's very uncool.
747276 749543 You're sorry? Check my shorts!
750283 752777 -Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />-What's a hammer?
754625 758122 Easy. lt's no Saturday Night Special,<br />for crying out loud.
759971 761463 Give it back.
763580 765641 A man's not even safe in his own home.
765918 767478 Then stay the hell out of here.
768324 769987 You got any traffic warrants?
770261 771491 Can you fix them?
778680 781015 Almost time. Are we taping this?
781287 784192 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
784461 785794 Take the stairs.
786031 789163 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
789372 792368 -The color's no good.<br />-lt's fine. You'll mess it up.
792647 794115 l want you to look good.
794317 794977 Unplug it.
795219 796482 That's your sister!
796889 798119 Picture's perfect.
798326 798918 Yeah?
800598 801497 Do l know you?
802168 802794 Yes, sir.
803404 805899 We had a long talk about a week ago.
806177 807236 About what?
807514 809074 Your new hobby room.
809351 811014 This is George.
813928 815865 Did you sense that l liked you?
817035 818197 Yes, sir.
819107 820872 Sit down and be quiet.
824218 827386 -What are you eating?<br />-My tuna fish sandwich.
827627 828560 Tuna?
829130 830963 You can't eat tuna!
831402 832871 Dad killed Flipper.
833072 834735 We're boycotting tuna...
834976 838941 ...because they kill the dolphins<br />that get caught in the nets.
839587 840681 Have ham.
840924 842223 Eat Miss Piggy.
843329 845664 -l'm sorry!<br />-lt's only my eye.
850613 852606 Oh, my God! lt's coming on!
855457 856687 My baby!
857796 860290 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
869189 870852 When the time has come...
871561 873555 ...and the moment is right...
874568 875729 ...remember...
876238 878573 ...use Ramses' Extra condoms.
880147 881946 -We do!<br />-Ramses' Extra.
882686 885956 Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.
895282 896774 Take the kids upstairs.
897687 899452 We learn this in Human Development.
899725 902357 ln Human what?!<br />Human Development what?!
902565 904057 Chill out, Daddy.
904302 905635 Upstairs!
905906 907398 Nick, upstairs.
907911 910075 You know how your father is.
910316 912914 -l looked fat.<br />-l liked you.
915160 916527 Home. Out!
917332 918392 l got a gun.
923848 926183 What? She looked beautiful.
926453 929790 l liked it. She made me want to buy<br />rubbers right now.
936978 940145 l thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was....
941053 943388 -l thought you were terrific.<br />-Really?
943659 945892 l think she's got a hell of a future.
946666 948500 George is afraid. He's going home.
948738 949934 Stick around.
950341 951742 He has a gun.
952012 955179 lt's an old gun<br />and he's not a very good shot.
956022 958585 That's good. l'm going anyway.<br />Good night.
958861 961493 -l'll buy you a beer.<br />-You let him buy it.
961701 964697 You're under 21 . Be back by midnight.
965944 968279 Wait and see. Cops never let up.
968550 972548 l'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />rubbers in the mail, in the coffee....
972793 977236 lf you'd only kept your mouth shut!<br />l'm going for a walk.
977470 980466 Give the boys some credit.<br />ln one ear, out the rubber.
993474 995809 How goes it with you, Hans?
996013 998177 Okay. You, Pieter?
999153 1002149 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1004165 1007161 Mind the plastic.<br />l'm having painting done.
1008509 1010274 The important thing is...
1010513 1011504 ...are you okay?
1011849 1013682 No bones broken?
1014188 1015521 l'm fine, thanks.
1016260 1017695 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1018364 1019697 Yeah, that's all.
1019968 1021300 Good, good.
1024879 1027852 However, we lost over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1029223 1032390 l know. l'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1032997 1034227 lt happens.
1034568 1036402 lt's not your fault.
1036740 1039736 Sometimes things do not go as planned.
1040582 1044023 As you say, they just happen,<br />Eh, Pieter?
1052208 1055375 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word, ''drop cloth.''
1057053 1060356 Certain policemen have become<br />an intolerable nuisance.
1060962 1065462 They are obviously on to us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1065807 1067140 Warn them off.
1068980 1070643 lt's my experience...
1071085 1074422 ...that a scared cop<br />is more useful than a dead one.
1074660 1075822 A warning?
1076431 1078162 ls that not a bit tame?
1078603 1080003 Depends on how you do it.
1082010 1083912 Then you better look at this.
1090363 1093700 This is the policeman in charge.
1096310 1097505 A Kaffir.
1099216 1100378 Lovely.
1101555 1103184 Remember to take these in order.
1104061 1106897 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1108839 1110240 This yours?
1110911 1112608 l found it in the wash.
1119195 1120755 l keep losing this.
1121936 1123165 Something's wrong.
1123539 1126944 No, not really.<br />lt's just a goddamn pen.
1129887 1131254 What about the pen?
1131792 1133625 lt reminds me of something.
1134631 1135861 Of what?
1136469 1138132 lt reminds me of...
1138473 1140307 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1141480 1142915 l didn't mean to push.
1144320 1147122 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1152171 1156671 l was to meet her for dinner.<br />One of those romantic dinners for two.
1156949 1158145 l had so much work.
1160624 1162423 And l forgot about it.
1164032 1168202 She waited at the restaurant<br />for an hour before she drove home.
1169979 1174149 lt was midnight when l got home<br />to a ringing phone. l answered it.
1174389 1176883 They said she was killed in a car crash.
1182407 1185403 lf l'd been driving,<br />we'd have been all right.
1188088 1192086 l remember falling down<br />on my knees and shaking all over.
1192430 1195096 l remember thinking, ''l'm losing it.''
1196272 1198607 There l was lying on the floor...
1200115 1204148 ...and l'm seeing under the couch,<br />and l see this gold pen.
1205560 1210299 Just lying there. l'd been looking<br />for it for two months. There it is.
1212143 1214136 She wasn't a great housekeeper.
1215818 1219554 This voice goes off in my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1220495 1222830 lt said, ''Get up! Now!''
1224337 1228676 l didn't feel like it, but l got up.<br />Muscles were still working.
1229182 1231619 Then l drove to the hospital...
1231955 1235122 ...identified her, signed her out<br />with my gold pen.
1235362 1237663 Trish found a gold pen in the laundry.
1247891 1250055 Look around you, Sam.
1251733 1253225 One day, Sam...
1254240 1255903 ...this'll all be yours.
1259517 1262581 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1263426 1265761 A man could be happy here.
1269942 1273940 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you get piles?
1274218 1275813 Let's go watch TV.
1365093 1366323 Kaffirs!
1369838 1371398 Wondering about your kids?
1372511 1374675 About what we've done to them?
1375618 1378146 lf l was you, l'd be going nuts now.
1379293 1381457 l'd be going fucking bananas.
1382534 1384197 Want to know what we've done?
1384805 1385670 Shall l tell you?
1387712 1390445 Just let your imagination run wild.
1391153 1393090 This has just been a warning.
1393392 1397060 After this, it gets bloody.<br />Tell your people to back off.
1397401 1399167 Don't be a smart Kaffir.
1399739 1401402 Maybe we let you live, huh?
1422292 1425287 -You didn't see a face?<br />-Not one. They had on hoods.
1425633 1426932 What about a voice?
1427136 1431636 That crazy motherfucker who did talk<br />had a strange accent.
1431980 1436650 Not German, not English.<br />Kind of guttural. Really shitty accent.
1436925 1440262 Wait. Anything like what we chased<br />the other night?
1440667 1443002 Yeah, kind of like that.
1443340 1444809 Trish and the kids?

1526698 1531198 l don't give a fuck! l don't have an<br />ulcer because l know when to say that.
1531475 1532967 Here's where he's staying.

1584330 1586494 Don't you want to see a badge?
1586736 1588205 -Where's your badge?<br />-Shut up.

1617573 1619567 That's fine. Hey, an old-fashioned--
1621082 1624146 Okay. l just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1624422 1626757 l didn't think anyone used them anymore.
1627329 1630496 l bet the kid's got an automatic.<br />Have you?
1630770 1631830 Yep, a Beretta.

1639724 1640384 Star witness.

1670260 1671854 lt's only room service.
1672599 1675436 You hungry? l'll call<br />for anything you want.
1675706 1677540 See this silk robe? Free.
1678213 1679944 -lt's not free.<br />-Yes, it is.

1686966 1688299 Morning, gentlemen.
1692311 1695979 That's my food. You guys<br />didn't want anything. Bring it here.
1696822 1697983 lt's mine.
1698826 1700592 You could have had something.
1701833 1703599 l ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1709785 1711254 Not the window!
1714194 1715185 Shit!
1740923 1742415 Where is that son-of-a-bitch?
1744197 1746965 Somebody stop that guy! Stop him!
1748774 1751611 Don't leave me! l can't swim!
1757795 1762397 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back!

1766481 1767450 You okay?

1770591 1772858 -Yeah, why didn't you?<br />-l was 7 floors up!
1774767 1776168 -He hit me.<br />-Good!
1778676 1783619 This guy took a big chance to pop all of<br />us. What'd you witness, a murder?
1783855 1785916 Nothing like that. Honest.
1788532 1792941 All l did was launder a half a billion<br />dollars in drug money.
1794045 1796039 Half a billion dollars?!
1796383 1799880 More or less.<br />Who can count that much money?
1800226 1803597 Could l have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1804068 1805731 Could you shut the fuck up?
1806406 1808069 You're supposed to take care of me.
1808411 1809242 Shut up!
1810582 1814079 Mr. Getz got away.<br />Our best opportunity and he gets away.
1814424 1818924 He slips through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1819770 1821034 What are you doing?
1821942 1825280 Checking to see<br />if l was standing on plastic.
1826119 1827782 Okay, l got it.
1828624 1831961 l'm who l am. You're a drug dealer.<br />l work in a bank.
1832300 1834931 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1835139 1836472 Bring it to you.
1837912 1840817 -He does.<br />-l don't understand. Why me?
1841086 1842419 Who am l?
1844427 1846831 You're a courier. You work for him.
1847100 1848433 l'm the drug dealer.
1852011 1855611 Don't you have plates? What is this?
1857758 1862292 l deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1863537 1864972 l issue you a cashier's check...
1865542 1869381 ...in his name,<br />minus a small commission for myself.
1870120 1871349 -The other end.<br />-You like breathing?
1871556 1872546 How much?
1872825 1873851 2%.
1874563 1877057 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1879574 1882741 You return it to me as collateral<br />on a loan l make to you.
1883083 1886579 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1886857 1887848 How's that work?
1888194 1890597 That's it! Don't you get it?
1890934 1894773 lt's your money. You don't pay it back.<br />And it's clean.
1895110 1897274 lt is now laundered.
1898785 1900618 You cops aren't too bright.
1902794 1904958 This is the best part.
1905634 1908471 You take a tax deduction...
1909075 1912379 ...on interest payments<br />you don't even make.
1913920 1916152 -Am l a genius?<br />-You're a swindler.
1916426 1917394 Cheat.
1917829 1919058 Come on!
1919666 1923664 Everyone cheats. Look at the Pentagon.<br />So you got it?
1925680 1928619 So how come you turned yourself in,<br />Mr. Big Shot?
1929188 1931421 l was scamming those guys for months.
1931861 1933854 Every transaction, l kept a little.
1934133 1934930 You?
1935537 1937700 lt was easy. Cash deposits...
1937975 1941312 ...millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1941550 1944580 Who's going to miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1945460 1946188 Drug dealers.
1947564 1949227 That's right. They did.
1949569 1952166 That's why l'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1954747 1956341 You can give that to Nick.
1957086 1960081 But it's softer.<br />l put a fabric softener in there.
1960360 1961385 lt's small, Leroy.
1961596 1965766 lt's Leo, not Leroy.<br />l'll buy you another shirt.
1966039 1968773 Just give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1969046 1970709 l don't know any.
1970951 1972944 l just dealt with the couriers.
1973223 1975056 Where does Trish keep my laundry?
1975294 1977128 Behind the machine.
1978636 1980971 You never met anyone except couriers?
1982478 1984072 No names.
1987322 1991822 Wait a minute, come to think of it!<br />Okay, listen.
1992166 1995663 They took me up in the hills<br />to a house on stilts.
1996175 1999171 And l had a job interview with a guy...
1999450 2001443 ...and his name was...
2002356 2003848 Haynes! Hans!
2004127 2006360 -Take us there.<br />-We have to sit on this guy.
2006700 2008533 lt won't hurt to look.

2017391 2019054 This is going to be great!
2019395 2022232 lf we're going, shouldn't l have a gun?
2024908 2027243 ls my nose still bleeding?<br />lt's really sore.
2027514 2029177 Sorry about that.

2038639 2042045 -That's another possibility.<br />-This is the ninth possibility, Leo.
2042314 2045378 That's it. Nine.<br />My lucky number. Nine.
2045656 2047649 Stay in the car.
2048997 2050830 -Can't l come?<br />-Stay.
2053006 2054339 Nice car.
2054911 2056744 -What are you doing?<br />-Hooking it up.

2101350 2104448 -Of course there is.<br />-This house is built on stilts.

2511625 2514723 l'm quaking in my boots,<br />but l'll still bring you down.
2515802 2517635 My dear officer...
2518674 2521476 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2524154 2526490 Who is the dickhead now, huh?
2530168 2535010 The South African government owns<br />this house. This is South African soil.

2662906 2666539 Apologize? He's a sack of shit!<br />He's a crook.

2674198 2677365 -Does that spell it out for you?<br />-Yes, sir.
2677607 2680774 -Who the hell is this guy?<br />-Leo Getz. Nice to meet you.
2683286 2687854 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />One you're supposed to be protecting!
2688063 2689031 He's alive, isn't he?
2689233 2692729 l signed a waiver.<br />Besides, l usually wait in the car.
2692975 2694638 Usually?
2694979 2697143 They're very adamant about that.
2697418 2699480 -l don't give a fuck.<br />-They're good cops!
2699757 2702821 They're the best.<br />One time, a guy was waiving a gun--!
2703165 2704428 What did he say?
2706673 2707801 What did he say?
2708009 2709569 -''l don't give a fuck.''<br />-What's that mean?
2709780 2713516 lt's his mantra. Why is everyone<br />parked on my desk? Up!
2714858 2716521 lt's a rubber plant!
2716796 2719530 lt looks to be about a week's supply.
2719803 2720794 Go spit.
2721039 2724035 l forgot. You're too old for that shit.
2726719 2729385 lf you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2753113 2755276 One moment, Miss Van den Haas.
2759628 2762624 l hope you understood<br />what happened here today.
2762968 2765964 l'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2766310 2768474 Why don't you explain it to me?
2768816 2773088 The policies of our government<br />are not popular here in America.
2773760 2777257 The police department here<br />is overrun with blacks.
2777837 2780833 They have badges and guns<br />and they hate us.
2781679 2783842 Our consulate, its staff...
2784118 2788355 ...and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2809241 2811337 Things are getting out of hand.
2811580 2816684 There are too many losses. We'll<br />move the cash in one large shipment.
2816926 2819193 We'll need more than a suitcase.
2819432 2823237 l'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2823708 2826179 Your warning did not work.
2834099 2835966 -Let's go, Leo!<br />-l'm coming.
2836304 2838639 Come on! Move!
2838977 2841107 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2841315 2842648 l've got to eat, too.
2844957 2846620 Give me the food.
2851773 2853766 Who ordered the super combo?
2855347 2857010 l get a steak sandwich.
2857319 2858309 Who gets Leo?
2858521 2862861 You got a big empty house. l got<br />a trailer. What will l do with him?
2863132 2865467 My place is too small. You take him.
2865705 2867037 l had him last night.
2867309 2868869 Excuse me, fellows.
2869814 2872047 This is tuna. l hate tuna.
2872320 2874986 l refuse to get stuck with tuna.
2875895 2879062 -Don't eat the tuna.<br />-l just said that!
2879402 2881566 l'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2881842 2883505 We're not going back! Shut up!
2883746 2886583 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back!
2886853 2889917 Let me give you<br />a friendly piece of advice.
2890261 2894225 Never go through the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2894437 2896100 Let me tell you why.
2896442 2899882 They fuck you at the drive-through!
2900117 2904116 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2904394 2906888 You won't turn around and come back.
2907133 2909628 So who gets fucked? Leo Getz.
2909906 2911500 l'm not eating this tuna!
2912145 2913478 Shut up! !
2988486 2990149 Get rid of that man.
2993164 2996501 You're going to have<br />to leave the premises right now.
3006194 3007720 The morning faxes.
3044949 3048116 What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3049059 3051222 l want you to bite Leo for me.
3062824 3064156 What are you doing?
3064164 3066294 l'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3066502 3068598 l like this pigsty.
3068841 3072680 When did you last do the refrigerator?<br />Or the pan under it?
3072951 3074283 There's a pan under there?
3076125 3078255 Where's my phone?
3079132 3080761 Where's my TV? What have you done?
3080969 3082802 Everything is outside.
3083041 3084635 Just stop what you're doing.
3084878 3087874 -Get the dog out of here!<br />-You go before the mutt.
3088219 3090053 Out, out! Oh, man.
3095236 3096899 lt's Collins.
3097340 3099072 Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
3099345 3100574 No. Why?
3100848 3103912 l haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
3105024 3106357 l'll be right there.
3111940 3113603 Stay in the car.
3121161 3122562 l'm upstairs!
3122966 3125301 Should l call 999, officer in distress?
3126473 3127601 l'll cover the back!
3127810 3130145 -Where are you?<br />-l'm up here.
3146854 3148015 ln here.
3163058 3164048 Good morning.
3170909 3172401 First time in 20 years...
3172646 3174708 ...l get the bathroom to myself.
3174918 3178415 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3178760 3182256 Just me and my new<br />Saltwater Sportsman magazine!
3191456 3194794 The one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3203650 3207990 So l'm reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3208829 3210492 ...when l glanced over.
3215678 3217341 Oh, Jesus.
3218351 3219342 ls that all?
3219587 3220988 You scared the shit out of me.
3221191 3223024 Scared the shit out of you?
3224699 3225997 How long you been here?
3226203 3228196 l've been here all night.
3228542 3231378 My legs are so numb<br />l don't know if l can--
3231649 3232981 Don't move.
3233219 3234380 l can't.
3234655 3236523 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3238330 3240894 lt's a dirty job,<br />but someone's got to do it.
3255704 3256831 Tell me l'm not fucked.
3258376 3259709 He's fucked.
3261885 3264220 Okay, but l'd be lying.
3265760 3267662 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3267899 3269231 That's a relief.
3269569 3271733 -l have to get help.<br />-No way!
3272074 3273064 Why?
3275750 3278017 l'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3278255 3282094 This is serious.<br />l got to get the bomb squad here.
3282364 3283424 Bomb squad?
3289314 3291444 Okay, call them in.
3294292 3296786 Don't use the open frequency.
3302511 3304481 Let's try to keep this quiet, okay?
3305150 3306983 Sure. Trust me.
3326032 3327695 An escort is really not necessary.
3328037 3331533 l know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3331945 3335476 l have helped policemen<br />through very traumatic moments.
3335721 3339058 There is nothing in this room<br />that l cannot handle.
3342069 3343402 l was wrong.
3344073 3345406 Excuse me.
3349753 3352384 l should've known,<br />where there's one, there's the other.
3361079 3363049 You're a psychiatrist?<br />l have these dreams.
3363451 3365114 lt's ready to come out.
3367627 3369621 l got to live in this house!
3371871 3372964 Clear this room.
3374810 3375744 Come on, Riggs.
3380256 3381019 You, too, Riggs.
3381259 3382158 No.
3383664 3385497 Riggs, out.
3392885 3394012 All right.
3396794 3398023 Dive into the tub.
3399533 3401868 Then pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3402373 3406178 This cast iron tub<br />will withstand a hell of a blast.
3406717 3407685 l can't.
3407886 3411053 He can't.<br />He's been on there for 18 hours.
3411328 3412991 He can't even walk.
3413232 3415066 l'm gonna have to help him.
3415905 3417568 All right, you better wear this.
3419112 3419909 The nitrogen?
3420382 3421213 Almost there.
3425026 3428431 He's spraying this thing<br />with liquid nitrogen...
3428767 3431604 ...to give you 1 or 2 seconds<br />before detonation.
3431874 3434540 -Got that?<br />-2 seconds. Thanks a lot.
3434881 3436214 Lights out.
3436451 3437943 Get him up and out.
3446441 3447637 Good luck.
3448078 3449570 You got a piece?
3449816 3451809 -Yeah, a Smith and Wesson.<br />-Try this one.
3452088 3454321 Safety's on. l'll collect it later.
3456097 3457430 Good luck.
3471633 3473364 Alone at last.
3474706 3477543 Why didn't they plant the bomb<br />in Trish's stove?
3478047 3481214 All the needless suffering<br />could have ended there.
3494752 3496346 l'm going to die on a toilet.
3497091 3499426 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3499630 3502501 And l'm here<br />and l don't plan on going now.
3504942 3506172 Let's do it.
3513061 3516466 On three.<br />Wait, let me get into the tub.
3517304 3519138 l'm just going to give you--
3519576 3522310 On three, huh? What do you say?
3524386 3525821 One...

3528095 3528994 Wait.
3531002 3533496 Do we do it on three, or...
3534176 3535611 ...one, two, three...
3535846 3539514 -...then do it?<br />-lt's your ass. lt's up to you.
3540758 3542557 My ass, yeah.
3542796 3543856 Three.
3544332 3545699 We go on three?
3545903 3548204 One, two and then three!
3551716 3552775 One....
3553020 3554318 Martin?

3575738 3576934 On three.
3612021 3615427 Get off me. l don't want anybody<br />to see us like this.
3619171 3620697 Mr. Jones?
3621443 3622377 Sit down.
3626053 3628183 What can l do for you today?
3628425 3631489 l have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3631734 3633967 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3634306 3636470 Of course, l can help him do that.
3637546 3639140 l want you to talk him out of it.
3640053 3640986 Talk him out of it?
3641757 3643192 Whatever for?
3643761 3647361 This is a bad time for him to go,<br />with all the trouble.
3647937 3650738 Have him come back later<br />in the week and we'll sit down...
3651780 3653306 He's here.
3653550 3655646 Yeah, he's here now. Alphonse?
3666112 3667878 There must be some mistake.
3670289 3671348 Say, what?
3674098 3677663 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3677873 3680504 l don't think you want to go<br />to South Africa.
3680812 3681838 Why not?
3685022 3686355 Because you're black.
3689633 3690932 You are.
3691170 3692469 He is.
3693107 3695841 Of course l am black.<br />That's why l want to go.
3696682 3699051 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3699255 3701192 ...against the racist...
3701393 3702088 ...fascist...
3702295 3703662 ...white minority regime!
3703932 3704923 Fascist regime!
3705135 3706297 One man, one vote!
3707507 3709842 Free South Africa, you son-of-a-bitch!
3711449 3714855 l've heard as much as l want to.<br />You must leave.
3716929 3721269 What's happening?<br />Don't touch me! Back off!
3724847 3727114 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3740383 3742012 End apartheid now!
3743423 3746453 You going to arrest me<br />if l don't shut up?
3759961 3763697 One man, one vote!<br />Free South Africa! Give me that flag!
3766476 3767603 You can't push me out!
3831358 3833157 You call this security?
3833396 3837429 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3841381 3843078 Wait, gentlemen!
3843285 3845552 Don't bother to call the police.<br />l'm here already.
3847261 3848696 l should have known.
3851471 3852735 Well, well.
3853510 3854569 The master race.
3857117 3859885 l hope you realize<br />the trouble you are in right now.
3860559 3865525 As usual, you people have everything<br />upside down and turned around.
3865770 3866932 Gentlemen...
3867608 3870273 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
3875626 3876457 Fingers off.

3887821 3890760 l've never seen it.<br />Where's it from, South Africa?
3892699 3893428 Don't move.
3900684 3905525 You haven't heard about me? l got a<br />bad reputation. Sometimes l go nuts.
3907467 3908058 Don't move.
3913480 3916248 l'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3916553 3918547 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3919394 3921227 You fold up your tents...
3921732 3923669 ...and get out of my country...
3924171 3926142 ...and l won't do anything to you.
3926911 3928437 l'll leave you alone.
3928648 3932521 'Cause if you stick around here,<br />l'm gonna fuck your ass.
3932757 3935423 Send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.

4024067 4026972 ''Alba Varden, Thursday.'' Alba Varden?

4157207 4158699 You got a rabbit at home?
4158944 4160139 lt's mine.
4160547 4161709 Shop one day at a time?
4162051 4163520 Good police work, officer.
4163788 4165622 l get paid for that.
4165893 4167864 l don't shop for the entire week.
4168065 4169294 Why not?
4170135 4172972 l never know what l'll be hungry for.
4174646 4176981 Wait. Have dinner with me.
4178255 4182492 l got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4183065 4188100 A beautiful sunset. Come on,<br />be original. Everyone else says no.
4188411 4190678 Come to my place. l'm a gourmet cook.
4190984 4192179 Let go of the basket.
4192387 4193321 l'll scream.
4195662 4198863 l'll embarrass you in public.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4199202 4201537 -Come on with me.<br />-No, no, please.
4201809 4205716 Let go of my bag! Look what she's<br />doing! Somebody call a cop!
4206987 4208388 What are you doing?
4208657 4210890 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4211164 4212656 You are a cop.
4221420 4223755 You must be an honest cop.
4224093 4228092 lt ain't much, but it's everything<br />l said. Look at the view.
4231110 4233581 l did exaggerate<br />about one thing, though.
4233782 4237119 l'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />l can only make chili.
4237457 4240453 -Like it with crushed Oreos?<br />-Of course.
4240798 4242529 A woman after my own heart.
4243137 4244629 Watch your step.
4245308 4246641 Sam wants in.
4246979 4250977 Here, sit down.<br />Oh, wait a minute. A little filthy.
4261179 4263480 l have no wine. How about a beer?
4263684 4264617 That's fine.
4265354 4266789 She drinks beer.
4283897 4286232 What's the matter?<br />You got a dirty glass?
4287906 4289900 Oh, it's the wedding ring.
4291581 4293244 l used to be married.
4293452 4294421 Not any more?
4296425 4297758 Not any more.
4301437 4302929 l've got something on the stove.
4307451 4310788 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials, isn't he?
4312629 4315625 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4317307 4318937 He's not a very nice guy.
4321417 4322977 Whatever he's doing...
4323487 4325151 ...he shouldn't get away with it.
4333612 4335138 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4335349 4338186 -What do you want?<br />-l hope better than Murtaugh.
4338522 4340185 Easy, easy.
4340694 4344692 Tell me something. Have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4344970 4347636 Who are you?<br />What do you want? l'm a cop!
4347877 4349278 No, you were a cop.
4349815 4351147 Hurry up, honey.
4351386 4355384 l'm going to take a couple laps<br />before l go to the station.
4409685 4413126 Sam, take a hike.<br />No Stooges tonight. Go on.
4435312 4436746 Get that beer in here.
4436982 4438314 Don't worry about it.
4438586 4440579 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4440991 4442152 l'm out.
4442494 4443827 Put some music on.
4452851 4454184 Who's not accounted for?
4454455 4455788 Riggs and Murtaugh.
4456025 4459522 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4459800 4461794 -And Riggs?<br />-Hasn't checked in yet.
4462039 4464135 Get on the radio and find them!
4464378 4468376 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4468655 4472494 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4473065 4474397 Sorry, Captain.
4481417 4482852 Get me Riggs.
4489936 4491462 l'll get that.
4493778 4494678 Wrong number.
4506808 4511650 Thanks to you, l missed my poker game<br />and l was feeling real lucky.
4512489 4516658 Okay, so what l see are nice,<br />conservative tax returns.
4516999 4519596 Everything by the book,<br />black and white.
4519805 4523109 So you just need to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4523347 4525180 ...if you want to see some bucks.
4525519 4528981 On your salary, there's not much<br />to do but you need deductions.
4529193 4530662 -My boat.<br />-You can't deduct it.
4530864 4532264 No, it's the bill of sale.
4532468 4534097 l know, but you can't do it.
4535074 4537204 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4537479 4538641 To my house.
4538982 4540451 Because of my boat.
4540653 4542316 Look at this commercial.
4542524 4545656 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4545998 4550338 What are you doing? l want to look<br />at the girl! Why'd you do that?
4550576 4552410 l didn't hear you say that.
4552681 4554014 Say what? She's great.
4554251 4556916 She makes me want to buy rubbers.
4566111 4568446 Time for the seventh inning stretch.
4572793 4574626 That's a baseball expression.
4574965 4576298 l know.
4577137 4579472 But we're only up to the fourth inning.
4584988 4586423 Batter up.
4595846 4597281 Stay in the car.
4598185 4600179 l'll only be a minute, okay?
4601025 4604021 Stay in the car? lt's cold.<br />You have no door.
4604299 4607466 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat.
4610714 4614553 Don't touch anything.<br />Nothing. l mean nothing!
4617563 4621060 Alba Varden. Why do l know the name?
4621906 4623899 lt's here. lt's got to be.
4624579 4628179 -Another day, another hobby.<br />-Yeah, another hobby. What's new?
4634268 4635794 That's the day on my boat.
4638411 4640108 lt's not there. Where is it?
4640783 4642275 My birthday.
4671018 4672351 l'll be damned.
4672723 4675890 Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.
4677300 4679361 Leo, l told you to stay in the car!
4680039 4680597 Shit!
4746893 4748362 Nailed them both.
4762062 4763394 My car!
4766404 4767737 Leo!
4826042 4829881 Get up, get dressed.<br />Get dressed. Come on.
4835162 4839400 -l don't understand.<br />-Just trust me. l got a bad feeling.
4906326 4909231 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the front seat.
4909500 4912496 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck!
4912740 4915041 -What about you?<br />-l'll be okay.
4915246 4918584 l'll meet you in the truck. Go on!<br />Stay out of the light!
4965962 4967522 The master race.
4995865 4999601 You shit! Who were those people?
4999874 5003838 You tell me. Was it your husband?<br />What are you doing Saturday?
5014808 5016071 lt's Sam!
5019486 5020283 Head down!
5038863 5041027 Come on, Sam!
5041971 5043463 Come on, Sam.
5043808 5045277 Shake a leg.
5045478 5046309 You made it.
5050223 5051886 Has he got any holes in him?
5053897 5056232 Oh, you clever dog.
5062752 5065919 l promised to have you home by 11 .
5066259 5069426 This is the most incredible first date<br />l've ever been on.
5069701 5071193 Wait until the second one.
5071438 5074536 -No more helicopters, please.<br />-Okay, l promise.
5075547 5077882 This is a very nice building.
5078454 5080891 Any vacancies? l'm between homes.
5081127 5082960 You can stay right here.
5084067 5084899 l can?
5085136 5087733 Yes, there's<br />a vacant apartment up there.
5090549 5091414 l'm kidding.
5091885 5093445 You can stay with me.
5093956 5094982 Tonight?
5095259 5098995 Yes, tonight. And tomorrow night.<br />And the night after that.
5099603 5100730 And after that?
5100939 5102773 Don't push your luck.
5109860 5111625 l better go.
5112900 5115531 Go inside and lock all the doors<br />and stay there.
5115807 5118210 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5118713 5121379 There's better ways of staying<br />in LA than working there.
5122054 5124389 All right. l've just quit.
5149383 5153553 l'll just grab a few things--<br />Hell, l haven't got anything.
5153894 5155625 Just bring yourself.
5158805 5160297 l better go.
5178250 5179445 Go home!
5194554 5195887 Go get the girl.
5217406 5220676 l would offer you a drink,<br />but l understand...
5220981 5222211 ...you're on the wagon.
5222451 5224284 That stuff will kill you quick.
5224757 5227753 You know so much about me,<br />who are you?
5232174 5234737 l changed the course of your life.
5235648 5237311 Four years ago...
5237586 5239819 ...when you was a narc at Long Beach...
5240092 5243429 ...you were getting too close,<br />so we put a contract out on you.
5243667 5245500 l handled it myself.
5245771 5248505 Drove your car right off the road,<br />remember?
5248945 5251782 But you weren't driving, were you?
5252120 5254283 You can't imagine the surprise...
5255126 5259968 ...when l pulled back a matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5261842 5263038 Your wife, right?
5265617 5267747 She didn't die straight away.
5269292 5270727 lt took a bit of time.
5278079 5280346 You don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5438715 5440617 She's dead. They killed her.
5441087 5442214 Where are you?
5442457 5446694 They killed her. She's dead.<br />They killed them both.
5446900 5450568 Slow down. Who are you talking about?<br />Where are you?
5450808 5452642 She's dead, Roger.
5454484 5458482 Calm down. We'll take care of it.<br />Where are you?
5458994 5461659 l'm not a cop tonight. lt's personal.
5462870 5465934 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5466946 5471514 l'm going to get those bastards.<br />l'm going to fuck them. l'm going now.
5472458 5476332 We're not going to the stilt house!<br />We're under orders!
5476535 5478802 Then the house will have to come to me.
5479040 5481204 They killed them both.
5481546 5484110 They got Rika and they got my wife.
5490267 5491235 Shit.
5504900 5505959 What's the deal?
5506937 5509774 You talk to the Feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5509978 5511242 That's not fair.
5515257 5516783 We trusted you.
5518865 5520596 You betrayed us.
5522139 5523129 You took our money!
5527150 5528278 We want it back now...
5528520 5531049 ...you slimy little shit.
5532764 5534928 Give him more. He likes it.
5568746 5570740 Don't try and stop me.
5571084 5573750 l've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5574526 5576929 They declared war on the police.
5578034 5579526 You know about that?
5579772 5582107 l heard it on the radio.
5582779 5585046 We don't have the authority.
5585284 5586411 Cavanaugh...
5586621 5588614 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
5590128 5594069 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5596142 5597577 You got a plan?
5601990 5604427 Drive around the front of the house...
5604829 5606663 ...wait for my signal...
5607802 5610330 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5610743 5611676 They got Leo.
5614183 5615277 Be careful.
5623071 5623970 Wait.
5624308 5625298 What's your signal?
5626880 5628816 You'll know when it happens.
5631691 5634162 Somehow l think l will know.
5681839 5682829 Feel like talking?
5688822 5689984 lt's the big one!
5694635 5696468 Cool it. Watch him.
5696706 5698198 Move me away from the windows!
5769540 5771875 Riggs, you crazy mother--!
5788417 5790081 Holy Christ!
5794431 5796766 -You all right?<br />-Yeah, l'm okay.

5799208 5801372 -Was Adolf in there?<br />-He got away.
5802450 5804420 -l'm going to find him.<br />-What about Leo?
5804621 5805919 What about Leo?
5806124 5807958 You're on your own now.
5808229 5809562 What do you mean?
5809799 5813262 Take my car to the police station<br />and wait for the Federal Marshal.
5813475 5815469 lt's been an experience knowing you.
5819989 5823157 -l don't want a hug.<br />-Go on. Lucky if you see him again.
5823431 5825094 l had a lot of fun.
5825770 5827501 You do your duty now.
5827775 5829608 l'm going to really get them now.
5829945 5831609 Listen. Wait.

5839133 5841366 Really? Okay. Really?
5847219 5848711 Check it out.
5848989 5852326 Alba Varden is a cargo ship,<br />not a woman.
5852565 5856061 The Port Authority said<br />that the Alba Varden arrived today...
5856340 5859176 ...and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.

6025394 6027125 Load the container.
6027399 6031066 The next time the sun hits<br />their bodies, they'll be in Cape Town.
