29863 32741 I love this job!<br />Can't you go faster?
32950 34910 - Floor this thing!<br />- It's my wife's.
35118 37871 - I won't go faster.<br />- You're doing 65 now.
38080 39623 657! Shit!
39873 42626 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
45337 48632 We're eastbound on Fourth,<br />in pursuit of a red BMW...
48840 50425 driver Caucasian, blond.
50634 52928 Plate "2-4-Adam-Henry-174."
54846 58141 You are westbound on<br />Second. 20-William-12's southbound...
58350 61853 approaching Second.<br />You're heading right for each other.
62062 63981 - Somebody back off.<br />- Got it!
64189 66817 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
67818 70862 You're gonna get us killed!<br />Shit! I'm...
86044 90007 We'll stick with this red<br />son of a bitch. You chase the blue.
90257 93844 20-William-15, that's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
94094 98390 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.
98849 100684 - Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And the squad.
100892 103478 - $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
103687 105314 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
105564 108692 I knew nothing about the wife's<br />station wagon. Bet's off!
108900 109943 Shut up!
119369 120704 What the hell is that?
120912 123373 What fucking language is that?
123582 124750 It's German.
125250 126293 Japanese?
126460 129421 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.
129630 130672 They own everything.
136428 137804 Shotgun!
146772 148482 Shots are being fired.
149149 150776 Thanks for the scoop.
151109 153779 The son of a bitch shot<br />my wife's windshield.
153987 156448 Entering the pursuit.<br />Westbound on Third and Hill.
168669 171380 Shit, man!<br />We're splitting up!
175801 178011 Son of a bitch!<br />Now we're cooking!
181598 182974 - Damn it.<br />- Step on it!
196154 197197 Look out!
204287 205455 See you!
226685 229479 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
245203 247664 We got one.<br />Yours is going up the hill.
247873 249166 So is Riggs, on foot!
253003 256173 Hey, Riggs!<br />Get your slow ass in here!
256381 258091 Get in here. Now!
258425 259468 Only if I drive.
259634 261303 - Move over, I'll drive.<br />- Go around.
261511 263889 No, go around. I'm driving.
264181 265557 I'll drive.
267267 269728 Did you get a make<br />on that red Beemer yet?
270020 271438 Not a scratch, you hear?
276735 278236 - You're not gonna make it.<br />- I will.
278528 279863 There's no room!
280071 281615 You're not gonna make it!
282741 285243 Look at my side panel!
295212 297714 Goddamn it, you were right, you know.
298048 300133 There wasn't enough room.
315941 318318 Get down! Get down!
319945 321905 Get down, stay down!
362612 364030 He's making a hard right.
373456 375292 Get out of the way!
390140 391683 This was a new car, Riggs.
392142 393184 It still is.
400859 402027 On three.
402694 403737 One...
404321 406239 two... three!
407699 408867 Shit!
410577 412746 You forgot your left indicator.
412954 415373 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
415582 418543 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamn it!
418793 420211 Me?! Where'd he go?!
420462 423089 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
423381 426301 - You come on "three"!<br />- It's "three,"‚Äù then go!
426551 428303 No! We always go on "three"!
428553 432390 Sometimes we go,<br />"one, two, three," then go!
432849 435101 Go check back there!
439397 440565 What was that?
442734 445028 - He's in the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
451785 453370 Holy Christ!
454079 455997 That's a lot of money.
459626 461169 What is this?
462045 463672 It's gold!
464089 465423 Fucking gold!
465632 467634 - Krugerrands.<br />- It's illegal.
467801 471054 - You can't import this into the country.<br />- You're right.
471596 475100 The damage you caused comes<br />out of the department's budget.
475308 479229 - Pay it off in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
479437 481564 You came up empty,<br />I want an explanation.
481773 485527 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said it was a routine bust.
485777 490657 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
491074 493243 This was bigger than we thought.
493493 494911 Talk to you later.
501334 505338 I worked psycho ward, Riggs.<br />You'll never get out.
505755 508133 One minute, 15 seconds.
508383 510343 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
511720 516266 What's going on here? Is this a<br />kindergarten class or police station?
516599 518309 Let's get some work done.
518810 521438 Houdini Jr. bets he can<br />free himself in five minutes.
521646 522689 I will too.
527902 529988 Don't try this at home, kids.
539873 541207 It's all over now.
541583 544711 Put your money on the table,<br />and get back to work.
546713 548048 Suckers!
552218 554137 Somebody check that thing, man.
554345 556806 How the hell did you do that?
556973 557974 Well...
558183 561811 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />I can do it whenever I want to now.
562020 563563 Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?
563855 565774 Yeah, it does.
566483 568109 But not as much as...
568318 570070 when I put it back in.
580663 582582 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
583166 585794 My door is always open, sergeant.
586503 590340 I think we ought to keep this<br />on a professional level, don't you?
591257 594094 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
594385 597263 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
597555 599974 And I need the money.<br />Cough up!
602811 605647 It's not all here yet.<br />I want it all. I want the lot.
612779 614697 Where did this come from?
615573 617742 You can't help yourself to this stuff.
617951 620411 This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
620912 623540 - That's mine. I won that.<br />- It's not yours.
623790 626167 You want to get busted?
627293 629295 Want to get something to eat?
629504 632549 Not tonight.<br />Rianne's commercial is on.
632757 635593 - Rianne's in a commercial?<br />- Not so loud!
635802 638638 What's the matter?<br />I'd be proud of her if I was you.
639472 642976 I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.<br />What if she stinks?
643184 645145 You gotta be kidding.<br />She'll be great!
645353 646771 Everybody, listen up!
647939 649983 Tonight at... What time?
650150 651192 Come on!
651484 652986 What time?
653486 654529 8:00.
654696 656489 At 8:00 on channel...?
657699 658741 Eight.
658908 661953 Eight. The sergeant's<br />beautiful daughter Rianne...
662162 663872 Here's her picture.
664747 668251 She'll make her television debut<br />in a commercial.
674674 677635 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
692525 695945 What happened? This was a new car.<br />Mom's gonna be upset!
696154 698948 - It's still new.<br />- It's not! It's wrecked!
699157 701618 I don't want your mother to know<br />about it.
702869 704454 Do your homework too.
704662 707624 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
707832 710293 Why don't you look out for me?
710501 714797 Hey, Ricky! I want to use<br />my driveway once in a while.
715089 716925 Nice oxygen tent.
717133 720637 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
721012 725225 This is a two-car garage, and this is<br />my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.
725433 729312 I retire when I'm 52, and the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
729520 732106 Cut it out.<br />You're not retiring, are you?
732315 735193 - I've thought of it since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
735568 738988 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
741866 742909 Jesus Christ!
743326 745161 What's wrong with you guys?
745370 747497 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
747747 750625 You're sorry?<br />Check my shorts, for Christ sakes!
750875 753628 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
754087 755505 Easy, easy.
755713 759133 It's no Saturday night special,<br />for crying out loud.
760468 762262 All right, give it back.
764097 765974 A man's not safe in his own home.
766182 768101 Stay the hell out of here, then.
768726 770395 You got any traffic warrants?
770603 771896 Why? Can you fix them?
779153 781406 Almost time.<br />Are we taping this?
781656 784575 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
784784 786077 Take the stairs.
786327 789539 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
789747 792709 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
792917 794419 I want my baby to look good.
794585 795628 Unplug it.
795795 797046 That's your sister!
797255 798464 Picture's perfect.
798881 800091 - You think so?<br />- Yeah.
801175 803469 - Do I know you?<br />- Yes, sir.
803678 806431 We had a long talk about a week ago.<br />Remember?
806639 808099 We did? About what?
808308 811352 - About your new hobby room.<br />- This is George!
813479 816232 - How you doing?<br />- Did you sense that I liked you?
817483 818526 Yes, sir.
819485 821487 Then sit down and be quiet.
824615 827702 - What's that you're eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
827869 828911 Tuna?!
829579 831581 Daddy, you can't eat tuna.
831789 833249 Dad killed Flipper.
833458 835168 We're boycotting tuna.
835376 839255 They kill the dolphins that get caught<br />in the nets. Only albacore.
839964 841007 - What?<br />- Have ham.
841299 842550 Eat Miss Piggy.
843843 845970 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
851017 852852 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
855813 857023 My baby!
858191 860360 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
869494 871329 When the time has come...
871913 874123 and the moment is right...
874999 876334 remember...
876667 879253 use Ramses Extra Condoms.
879921 880963 We do!
881130 882799 Ramses Extra.
883007 886344 Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.
893810 895311 Trish.
895686 897855 Take the kids upstairs.
898064 899899 We learn this in human development.
900108 902568 In human what?!<br />Human development what?!
902777 904445 Development. Chill out.
904695 905863 Upstairs.
906114 907615 Nick, upstairs.
908199 910326 You know how your father is.
910618 913079 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
913287 915123 - George.<br />- Yes, sir?
915331 916707 Home. Out.
916916 918626 - But, sir...<br />- George, I got a gun.
918876 920920 Yes, sir.
924090 926342 What's with you?<br />She looked beautiful.
926551 930263 I liked it. She made me want<br />to buy rubbers right now.
937228 940314 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was just...
941190 943651 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
943860 945778 I think she's got a future.<br />Don't you?
945987 948656 - Yeah, she was good.<br />- George is afraid of Daddy.
948948 950074 Stick around.
950533 951868 Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.
952076 955413 Yeah, but it's an old gun,<br />and he's not a very good shot.
956289 958791 That's good.<br />I'm going anyway. Good night.
959000 961711 I'll buy you a beer.<br />Let him buy the beer.
961919 963129 You're under 21.
963337 965089 Be back by midnight.
966132 968634 Wait and see.<br />Cops never let up, you know?
968843 972555 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />in the mail, in the coffee...
972763 977351 If you'd only shut your mouth. You<br />told everybody. I'm going for a walk.
977560 980688 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
993910 995953 How goes it with you, Hans?
996162 998623 Okay. You, Pieter?
999290 1002418 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1004295 1007924 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having some painting done.
1008716 1011469 The important thing is,<br />are you all right?
1011928 1013763 No bones broken?
1014430 1015765 I'm fine, thank you.
1015932 1017642 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1018434 1019810 Yeah, that's all.
1020102 1021604 Good, good.
1025107 1027944 However, we did lose over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1029445 1032448 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1033115 1034450 It happens.
1034742 1036619 It's not your fault.
1036953 1039956 Sometimes these things<br />do not go as planned.
1040665 1044168 As you say, they just happen,<br />eh, Pieter?
1052343 1055513 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word "drop cloth."
1056472 1060476 Certain policemen in this city<br />have become an intolerable nuisance.
1061143 1065648 They are obviously onto us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1065815 1067316 Warn them off.
1069026 1070653 It's my experience...
1071487 1074574 that a scared cop is<br />more useful than a dead one.
1074824 1076200 A warning?
1076492 1078327 Is that not a bit tame?
1078828 1080162 Depends how you do it.
1081998 1084000 Then you'd better look at this.
1090381 1093884 This is the policeman in charge.
1096512 1097805 Goddamn kaffir.
1099432 1100600 Lovely.
1101684 1103311 Remember to take these in order.
1104353 1107189 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1107690 1108733 Thank you.
1108899 1110192 This yours?
1111193 1112695 I found it in the wash.
1114030 1115072 Yeah.
1117366 1118367 Thanks.
1119410 1120953 I keep on losing this.
1122079 1123205 Something's wrong.
1123414 1127043 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1129962 1131339 What about the pen?
1131756 1133716 It just reminds me of something.
1134717 1135885 Reminds you of what?
1136719 1138220 It reminds me of...
1138554 1140389 the night Vicki was killed.
1141599 1142892 I didn't mean to push.
1144435 1147146 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1152151 1156572 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1156781 1158157 I had so much work.
1160576 1162453 I forgot about the whole thing.
1164163 1168459 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1170086 1174256 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1174465 1176926 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.
1182431 1185768 I should've been driving.<br />We'd have been all right.
1188145 1192108 I remember falling down on my knees,<br />and I started shaking all over.
1192316 1195194 I remember thinking,<br />"I'm just losing it."
1196278 1198906 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1200116 1203953 Lying there, and I'm seeing under<br />the couch, and I see this gold pen...
1205121 1206414 just lying there.
1206622 1210334 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1212128 1214213 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1215923 1219468 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1220469 1222847 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1224223 1226559 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1226809 1228686 Muscles were still working.
1228978 1231480 Then I drove to the hospital...
1231981 1234984 identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.
1235192 1238487 Gold pen? Trish found<br />a gold pen in the laundry.
1247872 1250374 Look around you, Sam.<br />Look around you.
1251667 1253502 One day, Sam...
1254170 1256005 this'll all be yours.
1259467 1262553 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1263345 1265598 A man could live here and be happy.
1269852 1273689 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?
1273898 1275691 Let's go watch some TV.
1364947 1366282 Kaffirs!
1369577 1371120 Wondering about your kids?
1372288 1374456 You wondering what we done to them?
1375457 1377960 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1379128 1381338 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1382298 1384008 Want to know what we done?
1384383 1385426 Shall I tell you?
1387469 1390139 You just let your imagination<br />run riot.
1390848 1392808 This has just been a warning.
1393142 1396896 After this, it gets bloody.<br />You tell your people to back off.
1397146 1398814 Don't be a smart kaffir.
1399481 1402318 Maybe we let you live, huh?<br />Come on, let's go.
1413829 1415915 Are you all right?
1422171 1425174 You didn't see a face?<br />No. They all had on hoods.
1425341 1426634 What about a voice?
1426842 1431388 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1431639 1433265 Not German, not English.
1433515 1436352 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1436518 1440022 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1440272 1442691 Yeah, kind of like that.
1443150 1444526 Trish and the kids?
1444735 1447655 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1447863 1452201 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?
1452451 1454453 Forensics get back with anything?
1454703 1456789 Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.
1457164 1460459 The point being, we gotta watch<br />each other's backs and fronts.
1460709 1464546 You're all invited to watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1464755 1467758 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1473389 1476058 I got something special for you boys.
1476225 1479228 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1479395 1483190 You guys are gonna babysit him<br />until Washington sends the feds.
1483482 1486610 - How long?<br />- Soon as the red tape is processed.
1486819 1488070 Three days.
1488404 1492491 This guy Getz is gonna testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1492741 1494910 Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.
1495411 1497287 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1498914 1500582 This is not a shit assignment.
1500916 1502918 -Yes, it is.<br />No, it isn't.
1503127 1505087 - It isn't.<br />- It's a shit assignment.
1505254 1506755 Shut up, the both of you.
1507006 1508090 Here you go, sir.
1508298 1510759 - I guaranteed this guy's safety.<br />- Why us?
1510926 1514263 Because you two are<br />the most qualified for the job.
1514513 1517433 And after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1517599 1518934 I can handle last night.
1520144 1521437 What do we do with him?
1521645 1523939 How should I know?<br />Take him to Disneyland.
1524148 1525941 This stinks. This stinks.
1526150 1527359 I don't give a fuck.
1527609 1530738 I don't have an ulcer,<br />because I know when to say that.
1530946 1533449 Here's where he's staying.<br />It's a nice hotel.
1533615 1536952 Expenses are paid by the Justice<br />Department, so enjoy yourselves.
1537286 1539621 And Riggs, one more thing.
1542499 1543542 Know what that says?
1543959 1546628 Same thing as that.<br />But I don't give a fuck.
1550632 1553469 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1562811 1564021 Excuse me.
1564480 1566148 What room is that for?
1566315 1567357 612.
1570194 1571987 This is it. 612.
1574656 1575991 Who is it?<br />- Police.
1576700 1577993 How do I know that?
1578327 1581830 After I shoot you through the door,<br />you can examine the bullet.
1583665 1585834 Don't you want to see a badge?
1586043 1587503 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1587669 1590047 I get it.<br />Bad cop, good cop.
1590464 1591840 Shut up!
1593050 1595344 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1595511 1598514 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1598722 1602267 Whatever you need, Leo gets.<br />You get it?
1602726 1605521 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1605854 1607856 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.<br />This is Sgt. Riggs.
1608023 1611276 How you doing? Nice to meet you.<br />What do I call you guys?
1611527 1614780 - Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.<br />- We're gonna be your shadow.
1617032 1619034 That's all right.<br />An old-fashioned...!
1620410 1623497 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1623705 1626542 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1626708 1629795 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1630045 1631213 Yep, a Beretta.
1631380 1632631 Don't touch it.
1633549 1635050 You sure you guys are cops?
1636051 1639721 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm the state's star witness.
1641265 1643016 We'll take that room.
1643767 1647729 Actually, I already have my stuff<br />in this room. You know, when I...
1652901 1655779 Okay, okay. It's yours.<br />My stuff's gone.
1656029 1658240 I'll move it in the small room, okay?
1658657 1662119 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1662327 1665789 Come on, loosen up a little, guys.<br />We'll be together a long time.
1667416 1668417 I'll get it.
1669543 1671795 It's only room service.
1672087 1674673 You hungry? I'll call<br />and get anything you want.
1674923 1677426 See this silk robe?<br />Silk pajamas? Free!
1677593 1679261 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is!
1679428 1682556 - It's taxpayers' money.<br />- Oh, God! It's the same thing.
1686143 1687686 Good morning, gentlemen.
1691607 1695319 That's my food! You guys didn't<br />want anything. Bring it here.
1696111 1697779 It's mine. Boy!
1698113 1700449 You could've had anything you wanted.
1701116 1702826 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1708957 1710500 Martin, not the window!
1713337 1714463 Shit!
1740155 1741615 Where is that son of a bitch?
1743492 1746161 Somebody stop that guy!<br />Stop him!
1747996 1751333 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1752000 1753752 Get off me!
1754002 1755003 Get off me!
1757005 1761635 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back.
1762010 1764346 Clear, move it! Get back! Police!
1765389 1766431 You all right?
1766640 1769393 I'm okay.<br />Why didn't you follow me down?
1769643 1772020 - Why didn't you?<br />- I was seven floors up!
1773355 1774439 He hit me.
1774690 1775691 Good!
1776066 1777651 Leo.
1777859 1780737 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1780946 1782739 Did you witness a murder?
1782948 1785075 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1787536 1792165 All I did was, I laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1793208 1795210 Half a billion dollars?
1795419 1799047 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1799298 1802718 Could I please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1803218 1804886 Could you please shut up?
1805554 1808390 - You're supposed to take care of me.<br />- Shut up!
1809182 1813312 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1813562 1818275 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1818900 1820235 What are you doing?
1821069 1824573 Just checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1825282 1827200 Okay, I got it. Okay, here.
1827617 1831204 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1831413 1833999 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1834333 1835500 I bring it to you.
1836918 1839921 - He does.<br />- Me? I don't understand. Why me?
1840297 1841465 Who am I?
1841757 1843258 I'll tell you.
1843425 1845802 You're a courier. You work for him.
1846094 1847929 I'm the drug dealer.
1851141 1854936 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1856772 1861318 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1862611 1865781 Then I issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1866156 1868742 minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1869785 1871495 - You like breathing?<br />- How much?
1871745 1872871 Two percent.
1873455 1876625 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1878627 1881838 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1882047 1885634 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1885842 1886885 How's that work?
1887052 1889679 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1889888 1893809 It's your money. You don't pay<br />it back. It's yours, and it's clean!
1894017 1896269 It is now laundered.
1897687 1899981 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
1900148 1901566 Okay, okay, okay.
1901817 1903985 This is the best part. You got it?
1904569 1907364 You take a tax deduction...
1907989 1911368 on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
1912828 1915330 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1915497 1916498 Cheat!
1916706 1918041 Come on.
1918500 1921044 Everybody cheats.<br />Look at the Pentagon.
1921336 1922587 So you got it?
1924589 1927676 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
1928176 1930387 I was scamming those guys for months.
1930846 1932764 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1932931 1933974 You?
1934391 1936560 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
1936893 1940188 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1940355 1943525 Who's gonna miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1944443 1945861 Drug dealers.
1946445 1948071 That's right. They did.
1948447 1951116 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1953702 1955370 You can give that to Nick.
1955912 1959040 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
1959207 1960250 It's small, Leroy.
1960459 1964629 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I'll buy you another shirt!
1964880 1967841 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1968049 1971845 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
1972053 1976057 -Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />On the shelf in back.
1977434 1979895 You never met anyone except couriers?
1981480 1982898 No names.
1986151 1989237 Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br />Come to think of it...
1989571 1990614 Okay, listen.
1990947 1994868 They took me up to the hills<br />in this house with stilts on it.
1995076 1997954 And I had a job interview<br />with a guy...
1998246 2000248 and his name was...
2001166 2002751 Haynes. Hans!
2002918 2005253 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2005462 2007297 It won't do any harm to look.
2007672 2009799 - I know the address.<br />- Let's go.
2009966 2011009 We shouldn't!
2011176 2013261 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2013428 2016014 We're back, we're bad!<br />You're black, I'm mad.
2016264 2018016 This is going to be great!
2018391 2021102 If we're going,<br />shouldn't I have a gun?
2021269 2022312 No!
2023688 2026191 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2026441 2028109 I'm sorry about that.
2032948 2034741 It should be coming up soon.
2034950 2037285 -9856.<br />That's it.
2037452 2040789 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility.
2040997 2044125 That's it! Nine. My lucky number.
2044459 2046670 Stay in the car, you hear?
2048004 2049881 Can't I come?<br />Stay.
2052133 2053468 Nice car.
2053969 2055887 What are you doing?<br />Hooking it up.
2056096 2058139 You're not looking<br />at what you're doing!
2058390 2062435 I know what I'm doing. I'm<br />towing your car, not a baby carriage.
2062644 2064896 You're chipping the paint.<br />I can hear it!
2065897 2068775 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell something.
2068984 2070485 What's that? A rat?
2070986 2072904 A stinky one too.
2076408 2077659 Where you going?
2077826 2080495 I'm a peeping Tom.<br />It goes with the badge.
2080787 2082205 It's fun sometimes too.
2084124 2085166 Bingo!
2089421 2090839 Lars, look!
2091047 2092924 What the fuck?
2096678 2097679 Hey! Hey!
2097846 2099848 - Where's the pool?<br />- There's no pool.
2100181 2101224 There's no pool.
2101433 2103351 This house is built on stilts.
2103518 2105687 Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.
2117574 2118992 Cuff yourselves.
2125999 2127584 Not this again.
2139763 2141556 Riggs! Where you at?
2142265 2144684 Stay where you are. Don't move.
2145268 2146561 You all right?
2146770 2148021 Move that truck.
2149731 2150732 Give me your keys!
2153234 2154486 You all right?
2155236 2156237 Where you going?
2156404 2157906 That was the hotel waiter.
2158073 2159115 Wait for me!
2159783 2160992 Get out of here!
2161201 2165080 What are you doing? You can't<br />take my truck! What's going on?
2167916 2170043 Don't worry.<br />We'll bring it right back.
2177217 2178259 Gotcha!
2178426 2180762 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2181012 2182263 Where did he go?
2183098 2184933 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2185141 2188561 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2189396 2191648 Get back! It's police business!
2192065 2194901 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2213962 2216756 Go faster! We gotta catch him<br />and your partner.
2232147 2233648 Hello, asshole!
2263595 2265847 Come on, come on. Give me that!
2281863 2284407 There they are! Hurry up!
2284657 2286534 Come on! Can't you go faster?
2286701 2288745 Will you shut the fuck up?
2296252 2297337 Look out!
2339170 2340588 Oh, shit!
2346719 2348263 Watch out!
2366447 2368700 Wipeout! It's all under control.
2368908 2370910 I told you to look out!
2373288 2376082 You're too old to drive this car.<br />Shut up!
2376457 2377500 And stay!
2377709 2379460 What do you think I am, a dog?
2393725 2395310 Hands behind your neck!
2400440 2403776 What are you doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2403985 2405153 What's going on?
2405320 2406487 Freeze, dickhead!
2407739 2410325 Get down here, dickhead.<br />It's been a bad day.
2410533 2411743 Show me your hands.
2411951 2413870 Take it easy, officer.
2414162 2417373 I'm not armed. I won't resist.
2418333 2421336 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right.
2421669 2423254 Do as I say!
2427759 2429469 Get your hands on your head.
2429802 2431346 Lace them behind your head!
2431554 2433348 You have no idea what you're doing.
2433890 2437977 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2438478 2440355 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2440647 2445151 I'm minister of diplomatic affairs<br />for the South African Consulate.
2446069 2448029 South Africa,<br />home of the Krugerrand.
2448279 2449822 Among other things.
2450073 2452867 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2453034 2455370 We have diplomatic credentials...
2457372 2458998 Keep your hands high.
2463002 2464295 Give me that.
2467590 2470426 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2470677 2473513 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2473888 2476849 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2477350 2478685 Pieter Von... Vor...
2478893 2480728 Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.
2481688 2484524 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2485858 2487819 -That's you.<br />It's official.
2489112 2490405 They are official.
2491322 2493574 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2493908 2497453 no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2497704 2500748 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2502625 2506045 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2506421 2509882 which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2510091 2513094 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2514220 2515972 My dear officer...
2517098 2519892 you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2523104 2525064 Who is the dickhead now?
2528401 2531404 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2531612 2533656 This is South African soil.
2533906 2535658 Now get out of here.
2536784 2537910 All of you.
2539078 2540163 Okay.
2542749 2544292 Come on, let's go.
2546753 2548087 Hey, man, don't do it.
2548296 2552967 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I'll make you eat this thing.
2555428 2556637 Kaffir!
2558514 2561309 With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2561517 2563811 - I went to school with him.<br />- Yeah, right.
2565646 2568983 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2570943 2573154 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2574906 2576324 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2578201 2579285 Don't open that.
2580453 2581996 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2582205 2585917 protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2586292 2588169 Is he serious with this stuff?
2588669 2589670 Yes.
2589921 2592548 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2592965 2594300 They were just leaving.
2597011 2598846 She is a consulate secretary.
2599847 2601557 Give her back the briefcase.
2604519 2605853 Give it to her.
2608189 2610858 Here. I'm sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2611359 2612443 It's only papers...
2612652 2614195 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2614445 2617198 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2617365 2620076 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2627375 2629877 I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2639011 2641097 - It's the Triangle Trade again.<br />- The what?
2641347 2644058 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2644225 2646102 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2646352 2648479 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2648688 2652483 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2652692 2656112 and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2656362 2660783 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2661033 2662201 Apologize?
2662410 2664704 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2664912 2667623 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2667874 2672128 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2672378 2674547 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2674714 2675756 Yes, sir.
2675923 2679552 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2681429 2686100 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2686309 2689270 - He's alive, isn't he?<br />- It's okay. I signed a waiver.
2689520 2692940 - Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />- Usually? Usually?
2693149 2695234 They're very adamant about that.
2695443 2698613 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops. They're the best.
2698821 2701115 One time, a guy was waving a gun...
2701324 2702617 What'd he say?
2704785 2705828 What did he say?
2706078 2708414 "I don't give a fuck."<br />It's his mantra.
2708623 2711751 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2713127 2714545 It's a rubber plant!
2714837 2717757 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2717924 2718966 Go spit.
2719133 2722303 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2724972 2727558 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2744158 2745785 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2751207 2753501 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2757838 2760967 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2761175 2764011 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2764387 2766514 Why don't you explain it to me?
2766889 2771394 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2771727 2775398 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2776023 2779110 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2779694 2781862 Our consulate, its staff...
2782196 2786492 and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2794000 2795751 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
2807138 2809056 Things are getting out of hand.
2809265 2811517 We are suffering too many losses.
2811892 2814645 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
2814895 2817273 We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
2817523 2821402 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2821569 2824280 Your warning did not work.
2832747 2834165 - Let's go!<br />- I'm coming.
2834373 2836542 Come on! Move!
2836792 2839086 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2839253 2842089 -Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />Come on, Leo.
2842882 2844467 Give me the food.
2849680 2852725 Who ordered the super combo?<br />Over here.
2853225 2854935 I get a steak sandwich.
2855186 2856228 Who gets Leo?
2856562 2858314 You got a big, empty house.
2858564 2860900 I got a trailer.<br />What will I do with him?
2861108 2863402 My place is too small. You take him.
2863611 2864945 I had him last night.
2865196 2866697 Excuse me, fellas!
2867782 2869950 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2870284 2873079 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
2873788 2876832 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- Where were you? I just said that!
2877291 2879627 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2879794 2881337 We're not going back. Shut up!
2881587 2884507 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
2884757 2887968 Can I give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
2888219 2891806 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2892098 2893974 You know why? Let me tell you.
2894308 2897812 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
2898020 2902024 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2902274 2904610 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
2904819 2907655 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
2907822 2909657 I'm not eating this tuna!
2909865 2911367 Shut up!
2984231 2985733 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
2986233 2988194 - Get rid of that man.<br />- Yes, Sir.
2990905 2994241 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3003918 3005377 The morning faxes.
3042623 3046168 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3046669 3049588 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3057263 3059682 Leo. Leo!
3060516 3061976 What are you doing?
3062184 3064144 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3064395 3066480 I like living the way I live.
3066689 3070818 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3070985 3072985 - There's a pan under there?<br />- Oh, please. Come on.
3074154 3076907 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3077116 3078701 Where's my TV?
3078951 3080828 Everything is outside.
3081036 3082621 Just stop what you're doing.
3082913 3086041 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3086292 3088002 Out, out! Oh, man!
3091922 3092965 Hello.
3093173 3094842 Riggs, it's Collins.
3095217 3098554 - Has Murtaugh checked in with you?<br />- No, he hasn't. Why?
3098804 3102016 I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
3103058 3104184 I'll be right there.
3110024 3111442 Stay in the car.
3111650 3112693 Get in there.
3115946 3117323 Roger!
3119116 3120367 I'm upstairs!
3120826 3123037 Should I call 999,<br />"Officer in distress"?
3124330 3125497 I'll cover the back!
3125706 3128167 -Where are you?<br />I'm up here.
3142014 3143223 Rog?
3144058 3145934 - Rog?<br />- In here.
3160866 3161909 Good morning.
3168707 3172503 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3172711 3176256 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3176507 3180010 Just me and my new<br />Salt Water Sportsman magazine.
3189269 3192606 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3195275 3196735 Yeah.
3201448 3205703 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3206537 3211125 when I glanced over, I saw this.
3213419 3215045 Oh, Jesus!
3216130 3217131 Is that all?
3217381 3221051 - You scared the shit out of me.<br />- Scared the shit out of you?
3222469 3223971 How long you been here?
3224138 3225889 I've been here all night.
3226223 3229059 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if I can...
3229309 3230602 Don't move.
3230894 3232062 I can't.
3232312 3235023 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3236108 3238902 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3244992 3246452 Okay, okay, okay.
3253250 3255461 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3256044 3257337 He's fucked.
3259465 3261842 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3263260 3265429 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3265637 3266847 That's a relief.
3267181 3269475 - I'll have to get help.<br />- No way!
3270058 3271477 Why?
3273312 3275564 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3276023 3279860 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3280068 3281153 Bomb Squad?
3287034 3289077 Okay, call them in.
3290204 3291830 - Martin?<br />- Yeah?
3292039 3294958 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3296502 3297711 Riggs!
3300130 3302174 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3303050 3304635 Sure. Trust me.
3321860 3323111 Excuse me, please.
3323320 3325405 Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3325656 3329409 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3329660 3333038 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3333247 3336917 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3339920 3341421 I was wrong.
3341755 3343257 Excuse me.
3345425 3346677 Riggs.
3346885 3349930 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3355978 3357729 Split.
3358272 3360732 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3361108 3363151 It's ready to come out.
3363777 3367322 Hey! Hey!<br />I gotta live in this house!
3369533 3370617 Clear this room.
3372494 3374037 Come on, Riggs.
3377958 3379793 - You too, Riggs.<br />- No.
3381336 3383255 Riggs. Out.
3390554 3392014 All right.
3392347 3393849 Sergeant.
3394349 3395642 Dive into the tub.
3396518 3399479 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3399897 3403775 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3404151 3405277 I can't do it.
3405485 3408530 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.
3408780 3410657 He can't even walk.
3410824 3412659 I'll have to help him.
3413660 3415495 All right, you better wear this.
3416788 3418790 - How's the nitrogen?<br />- Almost there.
3422502 3426173 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3426340 3429176 10 give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3429343 3432054 - Got that?<br />- A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3432679 3433722 Lights out!
3433931 3435515 Get him up and out.
3439311 3440938 - Let's go.<br />- Move!
3443899 3445192 - Good luck.<br />- Baker.
3446026 3447361 You got a piece?
3447569 3449404 - A Smith & Wesson.<br />- Try this.
3449613 3451865 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3453742 3455243 Good luck.
3458747 3460207 All right, let's move.
3466630 3467965 Well...
3469549 3471134 Alone at last.
3472260 3475430 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3475639 3479059 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3492364 3494491 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3494741 3497244 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3497411 3500414 Anyway, I'm here, and I don't<br />plan on going just now.
3502749 3504084 Let's do it.
3510757 3511800 On "three."
3512009 3514428 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3514886 3516888 I'm just gonna give you the...
3517431 3519641 On "three," huh? What do you say?
3522144 3523311 One...
3524312 3526314 - two...<br />- Wait!
3528483 3531111 Do we do it on "three"...
3531611 3533488 or "one, two, three"...
3533697 3536116 - then do it?<br />- Well, it's your ass.
3536283 3537409 It's up to you.
3538702 3540037 My ass, yeah.
3540454 3541496 "Three."
3541830 3543290 We go on "three"?
3543498 3545959 "One, two" and then "three"!
3549463 3550505 One...
3550839 3552215 - Martin?<br />- What?
3559056 3560182 I know.
3561349 3562976 I mean it, man.
3565937 3567230 I hear you.
3569983 3572319 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3573487 3574654 On "three."
3575655 3576865 One...
3577699 3578742 two...
3579159 3580327 three!
3589836 3591379 I gotta go! I gotta go!
3609606 3612901 Get off me. I don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3616905 3618240 Mr. Jones?
3619199 3621076 Sit down, please.
3623787 3625872 What can I do for you today?
3626039 3628875 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3629084 3631711 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3631920 3634214 Of course, I can help him do that.
3634422 3636883 I want you to talk him out of it.
3637634 3638802 Talk him out of it?
3639136 3640595 Whatever for?
3641096 3645100 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3645308 3648270 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3648520 3650647 - we can sit down...<br />- No, he's here.
3650897 3652232 - He's here?<br />- He's here now.
3652399 3653400 Alphonse!
3653567 3654734 Alphonse?
3662159 3663451 How you doing?
3663660 3665579 There must be some mistake.
3668039 3669249 Say what?
3671626 3675130 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3675422 3678258 I don't think you want<br />to go to South Africa.
3678425 3679551 Why not?
3682679 3684055 Because you're black.
3687142 3688310 You are.
3688768 3690061 He is.
3690604 3693565 Of course I'm black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3694441 3696776 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3696943 3699779 against the tyranny<br />of the racist, fascist...
3699946 3701281 white, minority regime!
3701489 3702616 Fascist regime!
3702782 3703867 One man, one vote!
3704075 3705118 One man, one vote!
3705285 3707495 Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!
3707704 3708997 You son of a bitch!
3709206 3712500 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />I demand that you leave.
3714628 3716296 What's happening here?
3717130 3718590 Back off!
3722219 3724721 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3738026 3739653 End apartheid now!
3740987 3744115 You're telling me to shut up?<br />You gonna arrest me?
3763885 3765178 You can't push me out!
3828908 3830702 You call this security?
3830910 3834998 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3838209 3839252 Wait, gentlemen!
3840253 3843089 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
3844591 3846343 I should have known.
3848845 3850305 Well, well.
3850972 3853308 It's the master race!
3854434 3857312 I hope you realize the trouble<br />you are in right now.
3857937 3861441 As usual, you have everything<br />upside down and turned around...
3861649 3863026 and back to front.
3863276 3864652 Gentlemen...
3865236 3867655 show Officer Riggs into the street.
3873119 3874120 Fingers off.
3874329 3875622 Hand off!
3876790 3878833 Let me look at that.
3881169 3885006 That's some piece of hardware.<br />Where the fuck do you get that stuff?
3885256 3888176 I've never seen that.<br />Where's it from? South Africa?
3890261 3891513 Don't move.
3897977 3901564 I'm surprised you haven't heard<br />about me. I got a bad reputation.
3901856 3903650 Sometimes I just go nuts.
3904901 3906152 Don't move.
3910824 3913660 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3913827 3915995 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3916704 3921042 You fold up your tents, and get<br />the fuck out of my country...
3921584 3923503 and I won't do anything to you.
3924045 3925713 I'll leave you alone.
3926005 3929217 If you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
3930009 3933054 Then I'll send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
3934347 3936516 Just get out of here...
3937058 3939060 kaffir lover.
3945525 3946693 Eenie...
3947193 3948194 meenie...
3948903 3950238 minie...
3951698 3952740 Hey, Moe!
3956870 3958329 Sorry, Adolf.
3960582 3962709 Pick them up with your hands.
3964043 3965712 Big smile.
3965920 3967380 Big smile!
3969591 3971885 Vorstedt, come over here!
3972093 3973344 Vorstedt!
3977599 3980226 - Hello. Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
3980435 3981978 What are you doing here?
3982228 3985482 I've been with your boss.<br />You know, shooting the breeze.
3985732 3987358 Shooting his fish.
3994157 3995492 Bye.
3997952 3999579 Okay, okay, okay.
3999746 4002665 The guy goes, "But, but, but...
4002916 4004375 you're black!"
4007253 4008671 He's black!
4009172 4012091 - I bet he was shitting.<br />- Started some shit with that!
4012300 4013927 You get into Rudd's office?
4014093 4015470 Yeah, I got up there.
4015678 4018431 Aryan Crud and his<br />Brown Shirts turned up...
4018640 4021100 but I ripped this off a pad.<br />What's that?
4021267 4024771 - "Alba Varden, Thursday."<br />- What do you think?
4024938 4026648 Is that Hitler's girlfriend?
4026898 4027982 That's Eva Braun.
4028191 4030109 He has a date with her Thursday.
4030318 4031903 Her name sounds familiar.
4032111 4034781 - You know her?<br />- No. It just sounds familiar.
4035031 4036699 Alba Varden...
4036950 4039953 There's a deli. Pull over.<br />Let's eat, I'm starving.
4040286 4041329 I'll spring.
4041538 4043414 Let's go. Sounds good to me.
4048711 4050797 - Out the other side.<br />- Other door, Leo.
4051005 4052131 Out the other door.
4052298 4053299 No cars.
4069023 4070441 Vorstedt!
4074487 4076155 That policeman.
4085957 4087000 Um...
4087250 4089085 You should pick from the bottom.
4089335 4091212 They put the old stock on top.
4091462 4092505 Officer Riggs.
4094591 4096676 I followed you from the consulate.
4096843 4098011 You followed me?
4098177 4102223 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush too.
4104392 4106102 I wanted to apologize...
4106394 4109272 for the other day,<br />in case we frightened you.
4109522 4112483 I was a bit startled<br />by all those guns.
4112859 4115778 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you too.
4116779 4118364 Thank me for what?
4123036 4125872 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4126539 4129751 There's a lot I don't like<br />about my boss and my country.
4130752 4132545 But I like my job very much.
4132712 4134922 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4135214 4136257 You like this town?
4138009 4139093 That's a new one.
4140428 4143264 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4143514 4145016 Rika Van Haagen-Dazs.
4145224 4148061 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.
4148269 4149896 That's a real pretty name.
4154275 4157153 - Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?<br />- It's mine.
4157403 4158738 Shop one day at a time?
4158946 4160573 Good police work.
4160740 4162742 I get paid for that.
4162950 4164911 I don't shop for the entire week.
4165119 4166329 No? Why not?
4167163 4170041 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4171793 4174962 - Wait. Have dinner with me.<br />- No.
4175296 4179967 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4180176 4181594 A beautiful sunset.
4181761 4185181 Come on, be original, say yes.<br />Everyone else says no.
4185431 4187558 Come to my place.<br />I'm a gourmet cook.
4187934 4189185 Let go of the basket.
4189352 4190395 I'll scream.
4190561 4191604 - Don't.<br />- I will.
4191771 4192772 Please...
4192939 4195983 I'll embarrass you.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4196192 4198319 - Come on with me.<br />- No. No, please.
4198778 4202448 Lady, let go of my bag!<br />Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!
4203866 4205451 What are you doing?
4205660 4207995 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4208204 4209664 You are a cop.
4218464 4220800 You must be an honest<br />cop, Martin Riggs.
4220967 4225972 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4228141 4230601 I did exaggerate about one thing.
4230810 4234147 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4234355 4237817 - Do you like it with or without Oreos?<br />- With, of course.
4237984 4239694 A woman after my own heart.
4240153 4241696 Careful. Watch your step.
4242488 4243531 Sam wants in.
4243740 4244824 Here, sit down.
4244991 4246367 Wait a minute.
4246909 4248494 It's a little filthy.
4258129 4260339 I haven't got wine. How about a beer?
4260548 4261632 That's fine.
4262675 4263843 She drinks beer.
4280735 4284530 - What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?<br />- No.
4284739 4287074 Oh, it's a wedding ring.
4288576 4290077 I used to be married.
4290286 4291370 But not anymore?
4293289 4294957 No. Not anymore.
4298294 4300922 I got something on the stove.
4304425 4307386 Is Rudd hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials?
4307553 4308888 What's that?
4309555 4312600 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4314268 4315770 He's not a very nice guy.
4318231 4321984 Then whatever he's doing,<br />he shouldn't get away with it.
4330409 4331911 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4332119 4335206 - What the hell do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4335414 4337083 Easy. Easy.
4337500 4341295 Tell me, have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4341587 4344423 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4344715 4346092 No, you were a cop.
4346592 4348219 Honey, we're gonna be late.
4348427 4352473 I'm gonna take a couple laps<br />before I go down to the station.
4380960 4383129 - Ow!<br />- Sorry.
4406485 4409864 Sam, take a hike.<br />No Stooges tonight. Go on!
4412491 4414327 He's sweet.
4432345 4433346 Get a beer, man.
4433554 4434847 Don't worry about it.
4435056 4437058 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4437516 4438684 I'm out.
4439060 4440561 Put some music on.
4449570 4453032 - Who's not accounted for?<br />- Riggs and Murtaugh.
4453240 4456369 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4456535 4458704 - What about Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in.
4458871 4460873 Get on the radio and find them!
4461082 4465211 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4465378 4469215 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4469882 4471384 Sorry, captain.
4478099 4479558 Get me Riggs.
4486732 4488234 I'll get that.
4503666 4508254 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.<br />And I was feeling real lucky.
4509213 4513467 Okay. So, what I see are nice<br />conservative tax returns.
4513676 4516887 Everything by the book.<br />Everything black and white.
4517096 4519682 You have to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4519932 4521934 if you want to see some bucks.
4522101 4525604 Your salary's not much to work with.<br />You need deductions.
4525855 4527273 - My boat.<br />- Can't deduct it.
4527565 4531444 - No, it's the bill of sale.<br />- I know, but you can't deduct it.
4531902 4533571 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4533779 4535114 - Go where?<br />- To my house.
4535281 4537074 - For what?<br />- My boat, man.
4537283 4539076 Look at this commercial!
4539285 4542413 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4542621 4544915 What are you doing?<br />Look at the girl!
4545124 4547001 You hit the button...
4547209 4550588 - I didn't hear you say that.<br />- Say what? She's great.
4550796 4553716 She has a great body.<br />Makes me want to buy rubbers.
4562933 4565436 It's time for the<br />seventh-inning stretch.
4569648 4571484 That's a baseball expression.
4571650 4573277 I know.
4573903 4576447 But we're only up<br />to the fourth inning.
4581660 4583079 Batter up!
4592421 4594048 Stay in the car.
4594757 4596842 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4597676 4600596 I don't want to stay.<br />It's cold. You have no door.
4600805 4604642 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat if you're cold.
4607603 4609063 Don't touch anything.
4609271 4611357 Nothing. I mean nothing!
4614443 4616278 Alba Varden...
4616612 4618322 Why do I know the name?
4618531 4620574 It's here. It's gotta be.
4621200 4624870 - Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, what's new?
4631168 4632461 The day on my boat.
4635047 4637049 Not there. Where is it?
4637550 4639051 My birthday.
4667580 4669206 I'll be damned.
4669415 4673586 Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.
4673752 4676005 Leo, I told you to stay in the car.
4676672 4677715 Shit!
4680593 4682928 Son of a bitch,<br />what are you doing here?
4743447 4744949 Nailed them both.
4747826 4749328 Leo!
4758504 4760005 My car.
4762841 4764260 Leo!
4822484 4824069 Get up, get dressed.
4824278 4825321 What is it?
4825529 4827281 Get dressed. Trust me.
4831577 4833287 - I don't understand.<br />- Trust me.
4833495 4835873 Something's wrong.<br />I got a bad feeling.
4836081 4838250 - I don't understand.<br />- Put this on.
4902564 4905484 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the seat.
4905734 4908654 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck.
4908862 4910906 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
4911115 4913409 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!
4913617 4915119 Stay out of the light.
4962124 4963876 Master race.
4985814 4986899 It's all right.
4991987 4994448 You shit! You shit!
4994698 4998243 - Who were those people?<br />- You tell me. Was it your husband?
4998452 5000162 What are you doing Saturday?
5010964 5012216 It's Sam!
5015719 5017513 Get your head down!
5034863 5035906 Come on, Sam!
5036281 5037783 Come on, Sam!
5038075 5039117 Come on, Sam.
5039868 5041411 - Shake a leg.<br />- Come on, boy.
5046250 5048126 Has he got any holes in him?
5050420 5052422 You clever dog!
5059638 5062391 I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.
5062599 5065394 This is the most<br />incredible first date.
5065602 5067479 Wait until the second.
5067729 5071066 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5071775 5074111 This is a nice building<br />you've got here.
5074653 5077114 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5077322 5079116 You can stay right here.
5080033 5081076 I can?
5081243 5083829 Yes, there's a vacant<br />apartment up there.
5086790 5089585 I was kidding. You can stay with me.
5090002 5091086 Tonight?
5091295 5095090 Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night<br />and the night after that.
5095257 5096300 And after that?
5097551 5099428 Don't push your luck.
5106018 5107769 I gotta go.
5108020 5111690 - But you said...<br />- Go inside and lock all the doors.
5111940 5114568 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5114776 5117946 There's better ways of staying<br />in L.A. than working there.
5118155 5120449 All right. I've just quit.
5145474 5149811 I'll just grab a few things...<br />I forgot, I haven't got anything.
5150020 5152147 Just bring yourself.
5154733 5156234 I gotta go.
5156652 5158028 Bye.
5158528 5161573 - Bye. Bye. Bye.<br />- Bye. Bye.
5173085 5174127 Bye.
5174336 5175545 Go home!
5175837 5177130 Go!
5190519 5192104 Go get the girl.
5213375 5216795 I was going to offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5216962 5218296 you're on the wagon.
5218547 5220424 That stuff will kill you quick.
5220632 5223468 You know so much about me,<br />who the hell are you?
5227931 5230684 I'm the guy that changed<br />the course of your life.
5231643 5233311 Four years ago...
5233562 5235981 when you was a narc<br />down at Long Beach...
5236189 5239484 you were getting too close.<br />We put a contract on you.
5239693 5241570 I handled it myself.
5241820 5244406 Drove your car off the road, remember?
5244990 5247242 But you weren't driving, were you?
5248201 5250912 You can't imagine the surprise.
5251121 5256001 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5257669 5258962 Your wife, right?
5261339 5263425 She didn't die straight away.
5265177 5266970 It took a bit of time.
5273977 5276188 Don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5433845 5436431 -Murtaugh.<br />She's dead. They killed her.
5436640 5437933 Where are you?
5438141 5440602 They killed her. She's dead.
5440810 5442354 They killed them both.
5442520 5446191 Slow down. Who are you<br />talking about? Where are you?
5446399 5448652 She's dead, Roger. She's dead.
5450362 5454115 Just calm down. We'll take<br />care of it. Where are you?
5454699 5458286 I'm not a cop tonight.<br />It's personal. I'm not a cop.
5458536 5461539 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5462540 5467212 I'm gonna get those bastards<br />and fuck them! I'm going there now.
5467420 5471883 We're not going to the fucking<br />stilt house. We're under orders!
5472050 5474344 Then the stilt house will come to me.
5474552 5477055 You don't understand.<br />They killed them both.
5477222 5479724 - They got Rika and my wife.<br />- Don't hang up!
5480308 5482727 Riggs. Riggs!
5485730 5487065 Shit.
5500453 5501579 What's the deal?
5502580 5505542 You talk to the feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5505750 5506835 That's not fair.
5510880 5512507 We trusted you, Leo.
5514509 5515677 You betrayed us.
5517554 5518680 You took our money!
5522600 5526021 We want it back now,<br />you slimy little shit.
5528106 5530442 Give him some more.<br />He seems to like it.
5564309 5566436 Don't try and stop me.
5566644 5569147 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5570065 5572817 They declared war on the police.
5573568 5575153 You know about that?
5575403 5577655 I heard it on the radio.
5578406 5580408 We don't have the authority.
5580658 5581910 Cavanaugh...
5582118 5584120 \Wyler, Shapiro...
5585663 5589667 Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5591503 5593004 You got a plan?
5597425 5600053 If you drive around<br />the front of the house...
5600261 5602347 you wait for my signal...
5603098 5605850 and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5606101 5607143 They got Leo.
5609604 5610855 Be careful.
5618071 5619197 Wait.
5619697 5620698 What's your signal?
5622158 5624202 You'll know it when it happens.
5626955 5629457 Somehow I think I will know.
5662115 5663408 Payday.
5677255 5679007 Feel like talking, Leo?
5684179 5685346 It's the big one!
5689934 5691019 All right. Cool it.
5691227 5693646 -Watch him.<br />Move me away from the windows!
5718254 5719631 Leo.
5727055 5728097 Watch the glass!
5728264 5729307 - Come on!<br />- I'll go.
5764801 5767095 Riggs, you crazy mother...
5783695 5785530 Holy Christ!
5789659 5790827 You all right?
5791035 5792120 I'm okay.
5792328 5793371 Thanks.
5794497 5796666 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
5797625 5799544 - I'm gonna find him.<br />- What about Leo?
5799794 5800878 What about Leo?
5801129 5803047 You're on your own now, Leo.
5803298 5804757 What do you mean?
5804966 5808386 Take my car to the station<br />and wait for the federal marshal.
5808636 5810888 It's been an experience knowing you.
5815226 5818229 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Give the little fellow a hug.
5818479 5820315 I had a lot of fun.
5820898 5822650 You do your duty now.
5822859 5825153 Don't worry.<br />I'll really get them now.
5825361 5827780 - Listen! Wait!<br />- You know how to find him.
5827989 5830074 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5831576 5833870 - Yeah.<br />- Loud as you want.
5834078 5835163 Really?
5835371 5837665 - Okay. Really?<br />- Bye, Leo.
5842420 5843755 Check it out.
5844088 5847592 The Alba Varden is<br />a cargo ship, not a woman.
5847800 5851304 The Port Authority said that<br />The Alba Varden arrived today...
5851512 5854390 and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.
5856434 5858394 This is the 11th dock.
5858603 5861606 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
5866861 5867862 The ship.
5868029 5869447 What did I tell you?
5871282 5874035 That container there,<br />with three heavy hitters.
5874243 5875370 Let's have a look.
5877205 5879540 I'll take two of them out.<br />You take one.
5881250 5885213 Better yet, you take two,<br />I'll take one. Pull over.
5931175 5932468 - Riggs?<br />- Yeah?
5932677 5933803 I can't see shit.
5934011 5935888 Me either. What is this shit?
5936097 5937640 Got a light?
5939183 5941352 It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.
5941519 5943771 I still can't see shit.
5945606 5948943 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5954031 5956534 Holy shit. Fort Knox!
5959829 5961831 Hell, how much is it?
5963499 5965001 Thousands.
5966544 5968504 Fucking millions!
5968838 5971549 Billions!<br />A fucking Donald Trump lotto!
5981726 5982727 Look at this.
5983478 5985730 These are thousand-dollar bills.
5987482 5991652 With what I'm holding, I could put<br />all three of my kids through college.
5992987 5994030 Take it.
6001579 6003080 Fucking drug money.
6003331 6004999 Do something good with it.
6005208 6007919 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
6020473 6022266 Load the container.
6022517 6026187 Next time the sun hits their bodies,<br />they'll be in Cape Town.
6030233 6033069 - This thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
6033277 6036030 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
6036572 6038032 Let's shoot our way out.
6038241 6040243 Don't do that. I got a better idea.
6094839 6096340 Our money.
6099343 6101679 Just make sure they're dead.
6112440 6116110 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- No, you go first. I'll cover you.
6131375 6133669 - How do we get out?<br />- I'm going this way.
6133878 6136130 I'll go this way.<br />I'll check over here.
6144847 6145890 Shapiro...

6369613 6370865 Drop it, asshole!
6377037 6379707 Diplomatic immunity!
6389967 6392553 It's just been revoked.
6398309 6399643 Riggs!
6404398 6406442 - Riggs!<br />- Roger.
6409153 6410404 Roger.
6470339 6473342 You're breathing. You're alive.<br />You're not dead.
6473717 6475219 No, don't die.
6476553 6479223 You're not dead until I tell you.
6479473 6483435 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6483644 6485229 You got that, Riggs?
6485479 6488357 You're not dead until I tell you.
6488565 6490651 Now breathe with me. Breathe.
6490859 6492486 - Now, breathe.<br />- Hey, Rog.
6494238 6495739 - Rog?<br />- Yeah?
6497658 6499994 Rog, in my pocket.
6506166 6507543 Here you go, buddy.
6507751 6510879 I want you to throw those things away.
6511088 6513757 Those things will kill you. Really.
6519763 6521682 You son of a bitch!
6523100 6524518 I thought you were dying.
6525019 6528230 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not dying in your arms.
6528439 6530024 You son of a bitch.
6535070 6538490 Are they all gone? The bad guys?<br />Did you get them?
6538866 6541118 They been de-kaffirnated.
6549918 6552629 Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.
6555132 6557301 Did anyone ever tell you...
6559511 6562056 you really are a beautiful man?
6566560 6568479 Give us a kiss before they come.
6570606 6572816 Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?
6577488 6579073 Don't make me laugh!
