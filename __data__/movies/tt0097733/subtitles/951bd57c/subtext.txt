30140 32820 God! I love this job! Man!<br />Can't you go any faster?
33060 34060 Floor this thing!
34260 36620 It's my wife's. I won't go faster.
36820 38100 You're doing 65 now.
38300 39820 65?! Shit!
40100 42820 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
45500 50420 We're eastbound on 4th, in pursuit of<br />a red BMW, driver Caucasian, blonde.
50780 53180 Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.
55020 58340 You are westbound on 2nd.<br />20 William 12 is southbound.
58660 61940 You're heading straight<br />toward each other.
62180 64340 - Somebody back off.<br />- Got it.
64620 67020 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
86180 90180 Go! We'll stick with the red bastard.<br />You chase the blue.
90460 94140 That's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
94380 98460 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20 William 15 and 20 William 12.
99060 101020 - That's Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And their squad.
101220 103700 - $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
103900 105500 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
105700 108700 I knew nothing about the wagon.<br />Bet's off.
108980 110140 Shut up!
119500 120860 What the hell is that?
121060 123500 What fuckin' language is that?
123740 124980 It's German.
125220 126340 Japanese?
126580 129580 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.
129860 130900 They own everything.
136700 138100 Shotgun!
146940 148700 Shots are being fired.
149260 150940 Thanks for the scoop.
151260 153740 The bastard shot my wife's windshield.
154100 155420 Entering the pursuit.
168780 171580 Oh, shit, man! We're splitting up!
175900 178220 Son-of-a-bitch! Now we're cooking.
182260 183220 Step on it!
196300 197420 Look out!
204500 205660 See you!
226780 229700 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
245340 247860 We got one. Yours is going up the hill.
248060 249380 So is Riggs, on foot!
253220 256180 Hey, Riggs! Get your slow ass in here!
256540 258180 Get in here, now!
258540 259660 Only if I drive.
259860 261500 Move over. I'll drive.
261700 264060 No, go around. I'm driving.
264300 266300 I'll drive.
267380 269380 Did you get a make on that red Beemer?
270140 271660 Not one scratch, you hear?
276820 278460 - You won't make it.<br />- I will.
278660 279860 There's not enough room!
280180 281820 You're not going to make it!
282900 284900 Look at my side panel!
295340 297740 Goddamn it, you were right.
298260 300180 There wasn't enough room.
362900 364260 He's turning right!
373580 374900 Get out of the way!
390260 391820 This was a new car, Riggs.
392260 393420 Well, it still is.
400940 402100 On three.
402780 403860 One...
404500 406340 ...two... three!
407860 409180 Shit!
410780 412700 You forgot to turn your indicator on.
412940 415580 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
415780 418700 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamnit!
418980 420420 Me?! Where did he go?!
420620 423300 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
423540 426500 - You're supposed to come on "three".<br />- I thought you meant, "three" then go!
426700 428500 No! We always go on "three"!
428700 431700 Sometimes we go, "one, two, three,"<br />then go!
433020 434300 Go check back there!
434540 438540 If you see anybody running out,<br />just pump the shit out of them.
439500 440900 What was that?
442820 445300 - He crawled into the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
451900 453540 Holy Christ!
454180 455660 That's a lot of money.
462180 463820 It's gold!
464420 465580 Gold!
465860 466980 Krugerrands.
467180 470020 It's illegal. You can't import them<br />into the country.
470340 471460 You're right.
471700 475260 The damage you caused is coming<br />out of the department's budget.
475540 479500 - Pay it in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
479780 481700 I want an explanation.
481980 485700 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said this was a routine bust.
485980 490860 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
491220 493180 This was bigger than we thought.
493700 495020 Talk to you later.
501540 504540 I worked psycho ward.<br />You'll never get out.
505900 508220 One minute, fifteen seconds.
508540 510380 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
511740 516340 Hey! What's going on? Is this<br />kindergarten or a police station?
516820 518220 Get some work done.
518900 521540 Houdini Jr. Bets he can free himself<br />in 5 minutes.
521820 522820 I will too.
528060 530140 Don't try this at home, kids.
540100 544540 It's over now. Put your money<br />on the desk and get back to work.
546860 548260 Suckers.
554500 556700 How the hell did you do that?
558260 562060 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />Now I can do it whenever I want.
562260 563700 Doesn't it hurt?
564060 565940 Yeah, it does.
566700 569620 But not as much as...<br />when I put it back in.
580900 582820 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
583300 585460 My door is always open, Sergeant.
586740 590300 We should keep this<br />on a professional level.
591460 594300 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
594580 597460 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
597740 599220 And I need the money.
599420 600300 Cough up!
602980 605820 It's not all here yet. I want it all.
612980 614940 Where did this come from?
615660 620500 You can't help yourself to this stuff!<br />It's evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
620980 623420 - It's mine. I won it.<br />- It's not yours.
623780 625780 You want to get busted?
627500 629500 Want to get something to eat?
629780 631260 Not tonight.
631620 633940 - Rianne's commercial is on.<br />- She's in a commercial?
634180 635820 Not so loud!
636020 638860 What's wrong?<br />I'd be proud if I was you.
639700 642860 I haven't seen it yet.<br />What if she stinks?
643140 645620 You got to be kidding. She'll be great.
645940 646940 Listen up!
648140 650180 Tonight at... what time?
650540 651380 Come on!
651700 653020 What time?
653860 654740 Eight.
655020 656620 Eight o'clock, on... channel?
659140 663300 Eight. The Sergeant's daughter, Rianne.<br />Here's a picture of her.
664980 668140 She's going to make<br />her television debut in a commercial.
674660 677500 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
692740 696220 What happened? This is a new car.<br />Mom's going to be upset!
696500 699180 - It's still new.<br />- No, it's not, it's wrecked.
699420 701860 I don't want your mother to know.
703020 704860 Do your homework too.
705100 707980 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
708180 710420 Why don't you look out for me?
710700 714780 Hey, Ricky! I want to use my driveway<br />once in a while.
715380 717220 Nice oxygen tent.
717420 720860 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
721220 725420 This is a two-car garage,<br />and this is my hobby room upstairs.
725700 730180 I retire when I'm 52, the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
730460 732260 You're not retiring, are you?
732540 735380 - I've thought of it, since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
735700 739140 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
742300 743060 Jesus!
743540 744900 What's wrong with you?
745780 747660 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
747900 750140 You're sorry? Check my shorts!
750900 753380 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
755220 758740 Easy. It's no Saturday Night Special,<br />for crying out loud.
760580 762060 Give it back.
764180 766220 A man's not even safe in his own home.
766500 768060 Then stay the hell out of here.
768900 770580 You got any traffic warrants?
770860 772060 Can you fix them?
779260 781580 Almost time. Are we taping this?
781860 784780 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
785020 786380 Take the stairs.
786580 789740 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
789940 792940 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
793220 794660 I want you to look good.
794860 795740 Unplug it.
795780 797020 That's your sister!
797460 798660 Picture's perfect.
798860 799860 Yeah?
801140 802060 Do I know you?
802700 803740 Yes, sir.
803940 806460 We had a long talk about a week ago.
806700 807780 About what?
808060 809620 Your new hobby room.
809900 811540 This is George.
814460 816380 Did you sense that I liked you?
817580 818740 Yes, sir.
819620 821380 Sit down and be quiet.
824740 827900 - What are you eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
828140 829060 Tuna?
829660 831460 You can't eat tuna!
831900 833380 Dad killed Flipper.
833580 835220 We're boycotting tuna...
835500 839460 ...because they kill the dolphins<br />that get caught in the nets.
840100 841180 Have ham.
841420 842700 Eat Miss Piggy.
843820 846140 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
851100 853100 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
855940 857180 My baby!
858260 860780 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
869660 871300 When the time has come...
872020 874020 ...and the moment is right...
875020 876180 ...remember...
876700 879020 ...use Ramses' Extra condoms.
880580 882380 - We do!<br />- Ramses' Extra.
883140 886380 Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.
895700 897180 Take the kids upstairs.
898100 899860 We learn this in Human Development.
900140 902780 In Human what?!<br />Human Development what?!
902980 904460 Chill out, Daddy.
904700 906060 Upstairs!
906300 907820 Nick, upstairs.
908340 910500 You know how your father is.
910740 913300 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
915580 916940 Home. Out!
917740 918780 I got a gun.
924220 926580 What? She looked beautiful.
926820 930180 I liked it. She made me want to buy<br />rubbers right now.
937340 940500 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was...
941420 943740 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
944020 946260 I think she's got a hell of a future.
947020 948860 George is afraid. He's going home.
949100 950300 Stick around.
950700 952100 He has a gun.
952380 955540 It's an old gun<br />and he's not a very good shot.
956380 958940 That's good. I'm going anyway.<br />Good night.
959220 961820 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- You let him buy it.
962060 965020 You're under 21. Be back by midnight.
966260 968620 Wait and see. Cops never let up.
968900 972860 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />rubbers in the mail, in the coffee...
973100 977540 If you'd only kept your mouth shut!<br />I'm going for a walk.
977780 980780 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
993780 996100 How goes it with you, Hans?
996300 998460 Okay. You, Pieter?
999460 1002420 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1004460 1007460 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having painting done.
1008780 1010540 The important thing is...
1010780 1011780 ...are you okay?
1012140 1013940 No bones broken?
1014460 1015780 I'm fine, thanks.
1016540 1017980 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1018620 1019980 Yeah, that's all.
1020220 1021580 Good, good.
1025140 1028100 However, we lost over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1029460 1032620 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1033260 1034460 It happens.
1034820 1036660 It's not your fault.
1036980 1039980 Sometimes things do not go as planned.
1040820 1044260 As you say, they just happen,<br />Eh, Pieter?
1052420 1055580 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word, "drop cloth. "
1057260 1060580 Certain policemen have become<br />an intolerable nuisance.
1061180 1065660 They are obviously on to us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1066020 1067340 Warn them off.
1069180 1070860 It's my experience...
1071300 1074620 ...that a scared cop<br />is more useful than a dead one.
1074860 1076020 A warning?
1076620 1078340 Is that not a bit tame?
1078780 1080180 Depends on how you do it.
1082180 1084100 Then you better look at this.
1090540 1093860 This is the policeman in charge.
1096460 1097660 A Kaffir.
1099380 1100540 Lovely.
1101700 1103340 Remember to take these in order.
1104220 1107060 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1108980 1110380 This yours?
1111060 1112740 I found it in the wash.
1119340 1120900 I keep losing this.
1122060 1123300 Something's wrong.
1123660 1127060 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1130020 1131380 What about the pen?
1131900 1133740 It reminds me of something.
1134740 1135980 Of what?
1136580 1138260 It reminds me of...
1138580 1140420 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1141580 1143020 I didn't mean to push.
1144420 1147220 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1152260 1156740 I was to meet her for dinner.<br />One of those romantic dinners for two.
1157020 1158220 I had so much work.
1160700 1162500 And I forgot about it.
1164100 1168260 She waited at the restaurant<br />for an hour before she drove home.
1170060 1174220 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone. I answered it.
1174460 1176940 They said she was killed in a car crash.
1182460 1185460 If I'd been driving,<br />we'd have been all right.
1188140 1192140 I remember falling down<br />on my knees and shaking all over.
1192460 1195140 I remember thinking, "I'm losing it. "
1196300 1198660 There I was lying on the floor...
1200140 1204180 ...and I'm seeing under the couch,<br />and I see this gold pen.
1205580 1210300 Just lying there. I'd been looking<br />for it for two months. There it is.
1212140 1214140 She wasn't a great housekeeper.
1215820 1219540 This voice goes off in my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1220500 1222820 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1224340 1228660 I didn't feel like it, but I got up.<br />Muscles were still working.
1229180 1231620 Then I drove to the hospital...
1231940 1235100 ...identified her, signed her out<br />with my gold pen.
1235340 1237660 Trish found a gold pen in the laundry.
1247860 1250020 Look around you, Sam.
1251700 1253180 One day, Sam...
1254220 1255860 ...this'll all be yours.
1259460 1262540 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1263380 1265700 A man could be happy here.
1269900 1273860 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you get piles?
1274140 1275740 Let's go watch TV.
1364900 1366140 Kaffirs!
1369660 1371220 Wondering about your kids?
1372300 1374460 About what we've done to them?
1375420 1377940 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1379100 1381260 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1382340 1383980 Want to know what we've done?
1384580 1385460 Shall I tell you?
1387500 1390220 Just let your imagination run wild.
1390940 1392860 This has just been a warning.
1393180 1396820 After this, it gets bloody.<br />Tell your people to back off.
1397180 1398940 Don't be a smart Kaffir.
1399500 1401180 Maybe we let you live, huh?
1422020 1425020 - You didn't see a face?<br />- Not one. They had on hoods.
1425380 1426660 What about a voice?
1426860 1431380 That crazy motherfucker who did talk<br />had a strange accent.
1431700 1436380 Not German, not English.<br />Kind of guttural. Really shitty accent.
1436660 1439980 Wait. Anything like what we chased<br />the other night?
1440380 1442700 Yeah, kind of like that.
1443060 1444540 Trish and the kids?
1444740 1447660 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1447900 1452060 Listen up! You heard what happened<br />to Rog last night?
1452580 1454540 Forensics get back with anything?
1454820 1456820 Not yet. They'll keep us posted.
1457180 1460500 We got to watch each other's<br />backs and fronts.
1460740 1464580 You can all watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1464860 1467660 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1473420 1475900 I got something special for you.
1476260 1479260 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1479540 1483180 You guys are going to baby-sit<br />until Washington sends the Feds.
1483540 1486740 - How long?<br />- Until the red tape is processed.
1486820 1488180 Couple, three days.
1488420 1492580 Getz is going to testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1492860 1494860 Drugs, laundered money, etc.
1495420 1496340 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1498940 1500620 This is not a shit assignment.
1500940 1502780 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1503220 1503940 It isn't.
1504260 1505140 It is.
1505460 1507300 Shut up, both of you.
1508380 1510060 I've guaranteed his safety.
1510300 1511139 Why us?
1511140 1514300 You two are the most qualified. And...
1514580 1517540 ...after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1517780 1519060 I can handle last night.
1520220 1521580 What do we do with him?
1521780 1523300 Take him to Disneyland.
1524140 1526060 This stinks. This stinks.
1526300 1530780 I don't give a fuck! I don't have an<br />ulcer because I know when to say that.
1531060 1532580 Here's where he's staying.
1532820 1537100 A nice hotel. The Justice Department<br />is paying. Enjoy yourselves.
1538220 1539580 One more thing.
1542500 1543620 Know what that says?
1543980 1546660 Yeah. Same thing as that,<br />but I don't give a fuck.
1550660 1553340 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1564660 1566220 What room is that for?
1566580 1567420 612.
1570100 1572060 This is it. 612.
1575420 1576700 Police.
1576940 1578060 How do I know that?
1578540 1581940 After I shoot you, you can<br />examine the bullet. Open up.
1583860 1586020 Don't you want to see a badge?
1586260 1587740 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1587940 1590260 I get it. Bad cop, good cop.
1590540 1591860 Shut up.
1593100 1595540 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1595780 1598700 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1598940 1602420 Whatever you need, Leo gets. Get it?
1602940 1605780 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1606060 1608180 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh, this is Sgt. Riggs.
1608380 1611300 Nice to meet you.<br />So what do I call you guys?
1611540 1612860 Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
1613060 1614900 We're going to be your shadow.
1617060 1619060 That's fine. Hey, an old-fashioned...
1620580 1623620 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1623900 1626220 I didn't think anyone used them anymore.
1626820 1629980 I bet the kid's got an automatic.<br />Have you?
1630260 1631300 Yep, a Beretta.
1633660 1635100 You sure you guys are cops?
1636100 1638940 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm a state witness.
1639180 1640460 Star witness.
1641500 1643060 We'll take that room.
1643980 1646420 I already have my stuff in this room.
1654180 1658340 It's yours, okay?<br />I'll move it in the small room.
1658660 1662020 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1662340 1666500 Hey, loosen up, guys!<br />We're going to be together a long time.
1667420 1668180 I'll get it.
1669700 1671260 It's only room service.
1672020 1674860 You hungry? I'll call<br />for anything you want.
1675140 1676940 See this silk robe? Free.
1677620 1679340 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is.
1679620 1682620 - It's taxpayers' money.<br />- Same thing.
1686380 1687700 Morning, gentlemen.
1691700 1695380 That's my food. You guys<br />didn't want anything. Bring it here.
1696220 1697380 It's mine.
1698220 1699980 You could have had something.
1701220 1702980 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1709140 1710620 Not the window!
1713540 1714540 Shit!
1740260 1741740 Where is that son-of-a-bitch?
1743540 1746300 Somebody stop that guy! Stop him!
1748100 1750940 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1757100 1761700 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back!
1762100 1764420 Clear! Get back! Police!
1765780 1766740 You okay?
1766940 1769620 Where were you?<br />Why didn't you follow me?
1769900 1772140 - Yeah, why didn't you?<br />- I was 7 floors up!
1774060 1775460 - He hit me.<br />- Good!
1777940 1782900 This guy took a big chance to pop all of<br />us. What'd you witness, a murder?
1783140 1785180 Nothing like that. Honest.
1787780 1792220 All I did was launder a half a billion<br />dollars in drug money.
1793300 1795300 Half a billion dollars?!
1795620 1799140 More or less.<br />Who can count that much money?
1799460 1802860 Could I have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1803300 1804980 Could you shut the fuck up?
1805660 1807300 You're supposed to take care of me.
1807660 1808500 Shut up!
1809820 1813300 Mr. Getz got away.<br />Our best opportunity and he gets away.
1813660 1818140 He slips through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1818980 1820260 What are you doing?
1821180 1824500 Checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1825340 1826980 Okay, I got it.
1827820 1831180 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1831500 1834140 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1834340 1835660 Bring it to you.
1837100 1840020 - He does.<br />- I don't understand. Why me?
1840300 1841620 Who am I?
1843620 1846020 You're a courier. You work for him.
1846300 1847620 I'm the drug dealer.
1851180 1854780 Don't you have plates? What is this?
1856940 1861460 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1862700 1864140 I issue you a cashier's check...
1864700 1868540 ...in his name,<br />minus a small commission for myself.
1869300 1870500 - The other end.<br />- You like breathing?
1870700 1871700 How much?
1871980 1873020 2%.
1873700 1876220 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1878740 1881900 You return it to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1882220 1885700 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1885980 1886980 How's that work?
1887340 1889740 That's it! Don't you get it?
1890060 1893900 It's your money. You don't pay it back.<br />And it's clean.
1894220 1896420 It is now laundered.
1897900 1899740 You cops aren't too bright.
1901900 1904060 This is the best part.
1904740 1907580 You take a tax deduction...
1908180 1911500 ...on interest payments<br />you don't even make.
1913020 1915260 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1915540 1916500 Cheat.
1916940 1918140 Come on!
1918780 1922740 Everyone cheats. Look at the Pentagon.<br />So you got it?
1924780 1927700 So how come you turned yourself in,<br />Mr. Big Shot?
1928260 1930500 I was scamming those guys for months.
1930940 1932940 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1933220 1934020 You?
1934620 1936780 It was easy. Cash deposits...
1937060 1940380 ...millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1940620 1943660 Who's going to miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1944540 1945260 Drug dealers.
1946620 1948300 That's right. They did.
1948620 1951220 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1953780 1955380 You can give that to Nick.
1956140 1959140 But it's softer.<br />I put a fabric softener in there.
1959420 1960420 It's small, Leroy.
1960620 1964820 It's Leo, not Leroy.<br />I'll buy you another shirt.
1965060 1967820 Just give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1968060 1969740 I don't know any.
1969980 1971980 I just dealt with the couriers.
1972260 1974100 Where does Trish keep my laundry?
1974300 1976140 Behind the machine.
1977660 1979980 You never met anyone except couriers?
1981500 1983100 No names.
1986340 1990820 Wait a minute, come to think of it!<br />Okay, listen.
1991180 1994660 They took me up in the hills<br />to a house on stilts.
1995180 1998180 And I had a job interview with a guy...
1998460 2000420 ...and his name was...
2001340 2002820 Haynes! Hans!
2003100 2005340 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2005700 2007500 It won't hurt to look.
2007860 2008780 I know the address.
2008980 2009740 Let's go.
2010020 2011020 We shouldn't do this!
2011460 2013340 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2013700 2016180 We're back! You're black, I'm mad.
2016380 2018020 This is going to be great!
2018380 2021180 If we're going, shouldn't I have a gun?
2023860 2026180 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2026460 2028140 Sorry about that.
2032740 2034580 It should be coming up soon.
2034980 2037300 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2037580 2040980 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility, Leo.
2041260 2044300 That's it. Nine.<br />My lucky number. Nine.
2044580 2046580 Stay in the car.
2047940 2049740 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2051940 2053260 Nice car.
2053820 2055660 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2055940 2057940 You're not being careful!
2058220 2060660 I know what I'm doing. It's a car...
2060820 2062180 ...not a baby carriage.
2062420 2064660 You're chipping the paint.
2065780 2068620 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell it.
2068860 2070260 A rat?
2070860 2072660 A real stinky one.
2076300 2077500 Where you going?
2077780 2082020 I'm a peeping Tom. It goes<br />with the badge. It's fun sometimes.
2084300 2085380 Bingo!
2089220 2090860 Lars, look!
2091140 2092180 What the fuck?!
2097660 2098900 Where's the pool?
2099140 2100120 No pool.
2100220 2103300 - Of course there is.<br />- This house is built on stilts.
2103500 2105660 I'm sure there's a pool.
2117380 2118780 Cuff yourselves.
2146580 2147940 Move that truck!
2149540 2150700 Your keys!
2153060 2154260 You all right?
2155100 2156180 Where you going?
2156380 2157860 That was the waiter from the hotel.
2158020 2159100 Wait for me!
2159420 2160860 Get the fuck out of here!
2161100 2163780 What are you doing?!<br />You can't take my truck!
2178300 2180740 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2180900 2182220 Where did he go?
2182620 2184940 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2185140 2188460 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2189140 2191620 Get back! It's police business!
2191980 2194460 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2213820 2216500 I love it! We got to catch him!
2232100 2233620 Hello, asshole.
2264500 2265540 Give me that!
2281740 2284220 There they are! Hurry up!
2284500 2286220 Can't you go faster?!
2286500 2288660 Will you shut the fuck up?
2366260 2368580 Wipe out. It's under control.
2368740 2370740 I told you to look out!
2373260 2375900 - You're too old for this.<br />- Shut up! Yak-yak-yak.
2376100 2377140 And stay!
2377420 2379420 What do you think I am, a dog?
2393660 2395260 Hands behind your neck!
2400180 2403500 What are you guys doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2403900 2405300 What is going on?
2405420 2406660 Freeze!
2407180 2408180 Get down here!
2408340 2410020 Come on, it's been a bad day.
2410460 2411500 Show me your hands.
2411860 2415180 Take it easy, officer. I'm not armed.
2415860 2417460 I won't resist.
2418180 2422300 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right. Do as I say!
2427620 2428620 Hands on your head.
2429540 2431140 Behind your head!
2431460 2433220 You have no idea what you're doing.
2433860 2437860 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2438300 2440300 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2440540 2444820 I'm Minister of Diplomatic Affairs<br />for the South African consulate.
2445820 2447980 South Africa. Home of the Krugerrand.
2448220 2449820 Among other things.
2450060 2452540 These men also work for the consulate.
2452900 2454580 We have diplomatic credentials...
2457220 2458980 Keep your hands out of there.
2467340 2470340 Everybody, take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2470580 2471580 Riggs?
2472100 2473420 You're Martin Riggs?
2473740 2476740 From Chicago. What's your name?<br />What's his name?
2477260 2478580 Pieter Von... Vor...
2478740 2480700 I'll just call you Adolf.
2481420 2485580 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?<br />That's you.
2486380 2487700 It's official.
2489020 2490260 They are official.
2491220 2493540 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2493780 2497260 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2497540 2500540 ...once his identity<br />has been established.
2502460 2505780 We have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2506100 2509700 ...which I will take up<br />with your State Department tomorrow.
2509940 2513060 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2514140 2515940 My dear officer...
2516980 2519780 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2522460 2524780 Who is the dickhead now, huh?
2528460 2533300 The South African government owns<br />this house. This is South African soil.
2533740 2535420 Now get out of here.
2536700 2537860 All of you.
2546500 2548140 Don't do it.
2548420 2552420 Don't do it or I'll make you<br />eat this fucking thing.
2555180 2556340 Kaffir.
2565500 2568660 Could you step out of the car, please?
2570700 2573020 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2574780 2576220 Sorry. Are you okay?
2578180 2579180 Don't open that.
2580180 2581860 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2582140 2585860 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2586140 2588140 Is he serious with this stuff?
2589700 2594180 These are police officers, Miss<br />Van den Haas. They were just leaving.
2596820 2598780 She is a consulate secretary.
2599700 2601540 Give her back the briefcase.
2604220 2605820 Give it to her.
2608060 2610540 I'm sorry, Miss Consulate Secretary.
2612500 2614140 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2614380 2617060 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2617340 2619980 Want to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2627180 2629500 I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2638860 2640660 It's the Triangle Trade again.
2641180 2646020 Don't you know American history?<br />Molasses to rum to slaves.
2646300 2648460 Now drugs to dollars to Krugerrands.
2648700 2652460 I got a dead guy with a surfboard<br />where his face used to be...
2652700 2656020 ...and the State Department<br />breathing down our throats.
2656300 2660780 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African consulate.
2661020 2664660 Apologize? He's a sack of shit!<br />He's a crook.
2664860 2667540 It doesn't matter. He's a diplomat.
2667820 2672060 He has immunity. We can't touch him,<br />arrest him, prosecute him.
2672300 2675460 - Does that spell it out for you?<br />- Yes, sir.
2675700 2678900 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you.
2681380 2685940 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />One you're supposed to be protecting!
2686180 2687140 He's alive, isn't he?
2687340 2690820 I signed a waiver.<br />Besides, I usually wait in the car.
2691060 2692740 Usually?
2693060 2695220 They're very adamant about that.
2695500 2697580 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops!
2697860 2700900 They're the best.<br />One time, a guy was waiving a gun...!
2701260 2702500 What did he say?
2704740 2705860 What did he say?
2706100 2707660 - "I don't give a fuck. "<br />- What's that mean?
2707860 2711580 It's his mantra. Why is everyone<br />parked on my desk? Up!
2712940 2714580 It's a rubber plant!
2714860 2717580 It looks to be about a week's supply.
2717860 2718860 Go spit.
2719100 2722100 I forgot. You're too old for that shit.
2724780 2727420 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2751140 2753300 One moment, Miss Van den Haas.
2757620 2760620 I hope you understood<br />what happened here today.
2760980 2763980 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2764300 2766460 Why don't you explain it to me?
2766820 2771060 The policies of our government<br />are not popular here in America.
2771740 2775260 The police department here<br />is overrun with blacks.
2775820 2778820 They have badges and guns<br />and they hate us.
2779660 2781820 Our consulate, its staff...
2782100 2786340 ...and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2807180 2809260 Things are getting out of hand.
2809540 2814620 There are too many losses. We'll<br />move the cash in one large shipment.
2814860 2817140 We'll need more than a suitcase.
2817380 2821180 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2821620 2824100 Your warning did not work.
2832020 2833860 - Let's go, Leo!<br />- I'm coming.
2834220 2836540 Come on! Move!
2836900 2839020 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2839220 2840540 I've got to eat, too.
2842860 2844500 Give me the food.
2849660 2851660 Who ordered the super combo?
2853220 2854900 I get a steak sandwich.
2855180 2856180 Who gets Leo?
2856420 2860740 You got a big empty house. I got<br />a trailer. What will I do with him?
2861020 2863340 My place is too small. You take him.
2863580 2864900 I had him last night.
2865180 2866740 Excuse me, fellows.
2867660 2869900 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2870180 2872860 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.
2873740 2876900 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- I just said that!
2877260 2879420 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2879700 2881340 We're not going back! Shut up!
2881580 2884420 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back!
2884700 2887740 Let me give you<br />a friendly piece of advice.
2888100 2892060 Never go through the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2892260 2893940 Let me tell you why.
2894260 2897700 They fuck you at the drive-through!
2897940 2901940 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2902220 2904700 You won't turn around and come back.
2904940 2907460 So who gets fucked? Leo Getz.
2907700 2909300 I'm not eating this tuna!
2909940 2911300 Shut up!
2986180 2987860 Get rid of that man.
2990860 2994220 You're going to have<br />to leave the premises right now.
3003900 3005420 The morning faxes.
3042580 3045740 What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3046700 3048860 I want you to bite Leo for me.
3060420 3061780 What are you doing?
3062620 3064700 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3064940 3067020 I like this pigsty.
3067260 3071100 When did you last do the refrigerator?<br />Or the pan under it?
3071380 3072700 There's a pan under there?
3074540 3076660 Where's my phone?
3077540 3079180 Where's my TV? What have you done?
3079380 3081220 Everything is outside.
3081460 3083020 Just stop what you're doing.
3083260 3086260 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3086620 3088460 Out, out! Oh, man.
3093620 3095300 It's Collins.
3095740 3097460 Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
3097740 3098940 No. Why?
3099220 3102300 I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
3103380 3104740 I'll be right there.
3110300 3111980 Stay in the car.
3119500 3120900 I'm upstairs!
3121300 3123660 Should I call 999, officer in distress?
3124820 3125940 I'll cover the back!
3126140 3128500 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
3145180 3146340 In here.
3161340 3162340 Good morning.
3169180 3170700 First time in 20 years...
3170940 3172980 ...I get the bathroom to myself.
3173180 3176700 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3177020 3180540 Just me and my new<br />Saltwater Sportsman magazine!
3189700 3193060 The one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3201900 3206220 So I'm reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3207060 3208740 ...when I glanced over.
3213900 3215580 Oh, Jesus.
3216580 3217580 Is that all?
3217820 3219220 You scared the shit out of me.
3219420 3221260 Scared the shit out of you?
3222900 3224220 How long you been here?
3224420 3226420 I've been here all night.
3226740 3229580 My legs are so numb<br />I don't know if I can...
3229860 3231180 Don't move.
3231420 3232580 I can't.
3232860 3234740 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3236540 3239100 It's a dirty job,<br />but someone's got to do it.
3253860 3255020 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3256540 3257860 He's fucked.
3260060 3262380 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3263940 3265820 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3266060 3267380 That's a relief.
3267740 3269900 - I have to get help.<br />- No way!
3270220 3271220 Why?
3273900 3276180 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3276420 3280220 This is serious.<br />I got to get the bomb squad here.
3280500 3281580 Bomb squad?
3287460 3289580 Okay, call them in.
3292420 3294900 Don't use the open frequency.
3300620 3302580 Let's try to keep this quiet, okay?
3303260 3305100 Sure. Trust me.
3324100 3325780 An escort is really not necessary.
3326100 3329620 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3330020 3333540 I have helped policemen<br />through very traumatic moments.
3333780 3337140 There is nothing in this room<br />that I cannot handle.
3340140 3341460 I was wrong.
3342140 3343460 Excuse me.
3347820 3350420 I should've known,<br />where there's one, there's the other.
3359100 3361100 You're a psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3361500 3363140 It's ready to come out.
3365660 3367660 I got to live in this house!
3369900 3370980 Clear this room.
3372820 3373780 Come on, Riggs.
3378260 3379020 You, too, Riggs.
3379260 3380180 No.
3381660 3383500 Riggs, out.
3390900 3392020 All right.
3394780 3396020 Dive into the tub.
3397540 3399860 Then pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3400340 3404140 This cast iron tub<br />will withstand a hell of a blast.
3404700 3405660 I can't.
3405860 3409020 He can't.<br />He's been on there for 18 hours.
3409300 3410980 He can't even walk.
3411220 3413020 I'm gonna have to help him.
3413860 3415540 All right, you better wear this.
3417060 3417860 The nitrogen?
3418340 3419180 Almost there.
3422980 3426380 He's spraying this thing<br />with liquid nitrogen...
3426700 3429540 ...to give you 1 or 2 seconds<br />before detonation.
3429820 3432500 - Got that?<br />- 2 seconds. Thanks a lot.
3432820 3434140 Lights out.
3434380 3435900 Get him up and out.
3444380 3445580 Good luck.
3446020 3447500 You got a piece?
3447740 3449740 - Yeah, a Smith and Wesson.<br />- Try this one.
3450020 3452220 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3454020 3455340 Good luck.
3469540 3471260 Alone at last.
3472580 3475420 Why didn't they plant the bomb<br />in Trish's stove?
3475940 3479100 All the needless suffering<br />could have ended there.
3492620 3494220 I'm going to die on a toilet.
3494940 3497300 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3497500 3500340 And I'm here<br />and I don't plan on going now.
3502780 3504020 Let's do it.
3510900 3514300 On three.<br />Wait, let me get into the tub.
3515140 3516980 I'm just going to give you...
3517420 3520140 On three, huh? What do you say?
3522220 3523660 One...
3524420 3525620 ...two...
3525900 3526820 Wait.
3528820 3531300 Do we do it on three, or...
3531980 3533420 ...one, two, three...
3533660 3537340 - ... then do it?<br />- It's your ass. It's up to you.
3538580 3540340 My ass, yeah.
3540580 3541660 Three.
3542140 3543500 We go on three?
3543700 3546020 One, two and then three!
3549500 3550580 One...
3550820 3552100 Martin?
3559140 3560620 I know.
3561340 3562700 I mean it, man.
3566060 3567460 I hear you.
3569980 3572220 We're not going to die, all right?
3573500 3574700 On three.
3609740 3613140 Get off me. I don't want anybody<br />to see us like this.
3617260 3618780 Mr. Jones?
3619540 3620460 Sit down.
3624140 3626260 What can I do for you today?
3626500 3629580 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3629820 3632060 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3632380 3634540 Of course, I can help him do that.
3635620 3637220 I want you to talk him out of it.
3638140 3639060 Talk him out of it?
3639820 3641260 Whatever for?
3641820 3645420 This is a bad time for him to go,<br />with all the trouble.
3646020 3649820 Have him come back later<br />in the week and we'll sit down...
3649860 3651380 He's here.
3651620 3653700 Yeah, he's here now. Alphonse?
3664140 3665900 There must be some mistake.
3668340 3669380 Say, what?
3672140 3675700 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3675900 3678540 I don't think you want to go<br />to South Africa.
3678820 3679860 Why not?
3683060 3684380 Because you're black.
3687660 3688940 You are.
3689180 3690460 He is.
3691100 3693860 Of course I am black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3694700 3697060 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3697260 3699180 ...against the racist...
3699380 3700100 ...fascist...
3700300 3701660 ...white minority regime!
3701940 3702900 Fascist regime!
3703140 3704300 One man, one vote!
3705500 3707820 Free South Africa, you son-of-a-bitch!
3709420 3712820 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />You must leave.
3714900 3719220 What's happening?<br />Don't touch me! Back off!
3722820 3725060 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3738340 3739940 End apartheid now!
3741380 3744380 You going to arrest me<br />if I don't shut up?
3757900 3761620 One man, one vote!<br />Free South Africa! Give me that flag!
3764380 3765500 You can't push me out!
3829180 3830980 You call this security?
3831220 3835260 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3839180 3840900 Wait, gentlemen!
3841100 3843380 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
3845060 3846500 I should have known.
3849260 3850540 Well, well.
3851300 3852380 The master race.
3854900 3857660 I hope you realize<br />the trouble you are in right now.
3858340 3863300 As usual, you people have everything<br />upside down and turned around.
3863540 3864700 Gentlemen...
3865380 3868060 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
3873380 3874220 Fingers off.
3874500 3875740 Hands off!
3877060 3878380 Let me see that.
3881420 3885220 That's a piece of hardware you got.<br />Where do you get that stuff?
3885580 3888500 I've never seen it.<br />Where's it from, South Africa?
3890460 3891180 Don't move.
3898420 3903260 You haven't heard about me? I got a<br />bad reputation. Sometimes I go nuts.
3905180 3906180 Don't move.
3911220 3913980 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3914260 3916260 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3917100 3918940 You fold up your tents...
3919460 3921380 ...and get out of my country...
3921860 3923860 ...and I won't do anything to you.
3924620 3926140 I'll leave you alone.
3926340 3930220 'Cause if you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
3930460 3933100 Send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
3934620 3936620 Just get out of here...
3937300 3939140 ...Kaffir lover.
3945820 3946980 Eenie...
3947820 3948900 ...meenie...
3949140 3950040 ...miney...
3952140 3953020 Hey, Moe!
3956980 3958660 Sorry, Adolf.
3960980 3962660 Pick them up with your hands.
3964420 3967660 Big smile. Big smile!
3969980 3971980 Vorstedt, come here.
3972420 3973580 Vorstedt!
3977660 3980660 - Hello, Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
3980940 3982260 What are you doing here?
3982500 3985660 I've been with your boss...<br />shooting the breeze.
3986020 3987500 Shooting his fish.
4000180 4004300 The guy goes,<br />"But, but, but... you're black!"
4007540 4008860 He's black.
4009540 4010820 No shit.
4011420 4012540 He started some shit!
4012820 4014380 You get into Rudd's office?
4014620 4015980 I got up there.
4016220 4021060 Aryan Crud and his Brown Shirts<br />turned up, but I ripped this off a pad.
4021660 4024540 "Alba Varden, Thursday. " Alba Varden?
4025300 4026900 Isn't that Hitler's girlfriend?
4027140 4028380 That's Eva Braun.
4028660 4030500 He has a date with her Thursday.
4030740 4032540 Her name sounds familiar.
4032900 4037060 I don't know her.<br />It just sounds familiar. Alba Varden.
4037380 4040060 A deli! Let's eat. I'm starving.
4040660 4041580 I'll spring.
4041820 4043740 Let's go. Sounds good.
4049020 4051820 - Get out the other side, Leo.<br />- It's okay!
4052660 4053500 No cars.
4074780 4076420 That policeman.
4087700 4089460 You should pick from the bottom.
4089700 4091380 They put the old stuff on top.
4091620 4092700 Officer Riggs!
4094940 4096900 I followed you from the consulate.
4097220 4098300 You followed me?
4098580 4102620 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush, too.
4104620 4106460 I wanted to apologize...
4106780 4109620 ...for the other day,<br />if we frightened you.
4109980 4112780 I was a bit startled by all those guns.
4113300 4116140 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you, too.
4116980 4118460 Thank me for what?
4123300 4125660 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4126820 4130140 I don't like many things<br />about my boss and my country.
4130980 4132820 But I like my job very much.
4133140 4135260 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4135500 4136660 You like this town?
4138340 4139500 That's a new one.
4140660 4143660 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4143940 4145380 Rika Van Haagen-Dazs.
4145700 4148380 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van den Haas. It's Dutch.
4148820 4150220 That's real pretty.
4154620 4156100 You got a rabbit at home?
4156340 4157540 It's mine.
4157940 4159100 Shop one day at a time?
4159460 4160900 Good police work, officer.
4161180 4163020 I get paid for that.
4163300 4165260 I don't shop for the entire week.
4165460 4166700 Why not?
4167540 4170340 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4172020 4174380 Wait. Have dinner with me.
4175620 4179860 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4180420 4185460 A beautiful sunset. Come on,<br />be original. Everyone else says no.
4185780 4188060 Come to my place. I'm a gourmet cook.
4188340 4189540 Let go of the basket.
4189740 4190660 I'll scream.
4193020 4196220 I'll embarrass you in public.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4196540 4198900 - Come on with me.<br />- No, no, please.
4199140 4203060 Let go of my bag! Look what she's<br />doing! Somebody call a cop!
4204340 4205740 What are you doing?
4205980 4208220 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4208500 4209980 You are a cop.
4218740 4221060 You must be an honest cop.
4221420 4225420 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4228420 4230900 I did exaggerate<br />about one thing, though.
4231100 4234420 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4234740 4237740 - Like it with crushed Oreos?<br />- Of course.
4238100 4239820 A woman after my own heart.
4240420 4241940 Watch your step.
4242580 4243940 Sam wants in.
4244260 4248260 Here, sit down.<br />Oh, wait a minute. A little filthy.
4258460 4260740 I have no wine. How about a beer?
4260940 4261900 That's fine.
4262620 4264060 She drinks beer.
4281140 4283460 What's the matter?<br />You got a dirty glass?
4285140 4287140 Oh, it's the wedding ring.
4288820 4290460 I used to be married.
4290700 4291660 Not any more?
4293660 4294980 Not any more.
4298660 4300140 I've got something on the stove.
4304660 4307980 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials, isn't he?
4309820 4312820 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4314500 4316140 He's not a very nice guy.
4318620 4320180 Whatever he's doing...
4320660 4322340 ...he shouldn't get away with it.
4330780 4332300 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4332540 4335340 - What do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4335700 4337340 Easy, easy.
4337860 4341860 Tell me something. Have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4342140 4344780 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4345020 4346420 No, you were a cop.
4346980 4348300 Hurry up, honey.
4348540 4352540 I'm going to take a couple laps<br />before I go to the station.
4406780 4410180 Sam, take a hike.<br />No Stooges tonight. Go on.
4432340 4433780 Get that beer in here.
4434020 4435340 Don't worry about it.
4435620 4437620 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4438020 4439180 I'm out.
4439540 4440860 Put some music on.
4449860 4451220 Who's not accounted for?
4451460 4452820 Riggs and Murtaugh.
4453060 4456540 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4456820 4458820 - And Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in yet.
4459060 4461140 Get on the radio and find them!
4461380 4465380 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4465660 4469500 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4470060 4471380 Sorry, Captain.
4478420 4479820 Get me Riggs.
4486900 4488420 I'll get that.
4490740 4491660 Wrong number.
4503780 4508580 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game<br />and I was feeling real lucky.
4509420 4513580 Okay, so what I see are nice,<br />conservative tax returns.
4513940 4516540 Everything by the book,<br />black and white.
4516740 4520020 So you just need to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4520260 4522100 ...if you want to see some bucks.
4522460 4525900 On your salary, there's not much<br />to do but you need deductions.
4526100 4527580 - My boat.<br />- You can't deduct it.
4527780 4529180 No, it's the bill of sale.
4529380 4531020 I know, but you can't do it.
4531980 4534100 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4534380 4535540 To my house.
4535900 4537340 Because of my boat.
4537580 4539220 Look at this commercial.
4539420 4542540 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4542900 4547220 What are you doing? I want to look<br />at the girl! Why'd you do that?
4547460 4549300 I didn't hear you say that.
4549580 4550900 Say what? She's great.
4551140 4553820 She makes me want to buy rubbers.
4562980 4565300 Time for the seventh inning stretch.
4569660 4571500 That's a baseball expression.
4571820 4573140 I know.
4573980 4576340 But we're only up to the fourth inning.
4581820 4583260 Batter up.
4592700 4594100 Stay in the car.
4595020 4597020 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4597860 4600860 Stay in the car? It's cold.<br />You have no door.
4601140 4604300 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat.
4607540 4611380 Don't touch anything.<br />Nothing. I mean nothing!
4614380 4617860 Alba Varden. Why do I know the name?
4618700 4620700 It's here. It's got to be.
4621380 4624980 - Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, another hobby. What's new?
4631060 4632580 That's the day on my boat.
4635180 4636900 It's not there. Where is it?
4637580 4639060 My birthday.
4667740 4669100 I'll be damned.
4669460 4672620 Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.
4674020 4676100 Leo, I told you to stay in the car!
4676780 4677539 Shit!
4743540 4744980 Nailed them both.
4758700 4760020 My car!
4763020 4764340 Leo!
4822580 4826420 Get up, get dressed.<br />Get dressed. Come on.
4831700 4835940 - I don't understand.<br />- Just trust me. I got a bad feeling.
4902740 4905660 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the front seat.
4905940 4908940 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck!
4909180 4911460 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
4911660 4915020 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!<br />Stay out of the light!
4962300 4963860 The master race.
4992180 4995900 You shit! Who were those people?
4996180 5000140 You tell me. Was it your husband?<br />What are you doing Saturday?
5011100 5012380 It's Sam!
5015780 5016580 Head down!
5035140 5037300 Come on, Sam!
5038220 5039700 Come on, Sam.
5040060 5041540 Shake a leg.
5041740 5042580 You made it.
5046460 5048140 Has he got any holes in him?
5050140 5052460 Oh, you clever dog.
5058980 5062140 I promised to have you home by 11.
5062500 5065660 This is the most incredible first date<br />I've ever been on.
5065940 5067420 Wait until the second one.
5067660 5070740 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5071780 5074100 This is a very nice building.
5074660 5077100 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5077340 5079180 You can stay right here.
5080260 5081100 I can?
5081340 5083940 Yes, there's<br />a vacant apartment up there.
5086740 5087620 I'm kidding.
5088060 5089620 You can stay with me.
5090140 5091180 Tonight?
5091460 5095180 Yes, tonight. And tomorrow night.<br />And the night after that.
5095780 5096900 And after that?
5097140 5098940 Don't push your luck.
5106020 5107780 I better go.
5109060 5111700 Go inside and lock all the doors<br />and stay there.
5111980 5114380 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5114860 5117540 There's better ways of staying<br />in LA than working there.
5118220 5120540 All right. I've just quit.
5145500 5149660 I'll just grab a few things...<br />Hell, I haven't got anything.
5150020 5151740 Just bring yourself.
5154900 5156420 I better go.
5174340 5175540 Go home!
5190620 5191940 Go get the girl.
5213420 5216700 I would offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5217020 5218220 ...you're on the wagon.
5218460 5220300 That stuff will kill you quick.
5220780 5223780 You know so much about me,<br />who are you?
5228180 5230740 I changed the course of your life.
5231660 5233300 Four years ago...
5233580 5235820 ...when you was a narc at Long Beach...
5236100 5239420 ...you were getting too close,<br />so we put a contract out on you.
5239660 5241500 I handled it myself.
5241780 5244500 Drove your car right off the road,<br />remember?
5244940 5247780 But you weren't driving, were you?
5248100 5250260 You can't imagine the surprise...
5251100 5255940 ...when I pulled back a matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5257820 5259020 Your wife, right?
5261580 5263700 She didn't die straight away.
5265260 5266700 It took a bit of time.
5274020 5276300 You don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5434460 5436340 She's dead. They killed her.
5436820 5437940 Where are you?
5438180 5442420 They killed her. She's dead.<br />They killed them both.
5442620 5446300 Slow down. Who are you talking about?<br />Where are you?
5446540 5448380 She's dead, Roger.
5450220 5454180 Calm down. We'll take care of it.<br />Where are you?
5454700 5457380 I'm not a cop tonight. It's personal.
5458580 5461660 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5462660 5467220 I'm going to get those bastards.<br />I'm going to fuck them. I'm going now.
5468140 5472020 We're not going to the stilt house!<br />We're under orders!
5472220 5474500 Then the house will have to come to me.
5474740 5476900 They killed them both.
5477220 5479780 They got Rika and they got my wife.
5485940 5486900 Shit.
5500540 5501620 What's the deal?
5502580 5505420 You talk to the Feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5505620 5506900 That's not fair.
5510900 5512420 We trusted you.
5514500 5516220 You betrayed us.
5517780 5518780 You took our money!
5522780 5523900 We want it back now...
5524140 5526660 ...you slimy little shit.
5528380 5530540 Give him more. He likes it.
5564340 5566300 Don't try and stop me.
5566660 5569300 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5570100 5572500 They declared war on the police.
5573580 5575100 You know about that?
5575340 5577660 I heard it on the radio.
5578340 5580580 We don't have the authority.
5580820 5581980 Cavanaugh...
5582180 5584180 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
5585660 5589620 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5591700 5593100 You got a plan?
5597540 5599940 Drive around the front of the house...
5600340 5602180 ...wait for my signal...
5603340 5605860 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5606260 5607180 They got Leo.
5609700 5610780 Be careful.
5618580 5619460 Wait.
5619820 5620780 What's your signal?
5622380 5624300 You'll know when it happens.
5627180 5629660 Somehow I think I will know.
5677260 5678260 Feel like talking?
5684260 5685380 It's the big one!
5690060 5691860 Cool it. Watch him.
5692100 5693620 Move me away from the windows!
5764860 5767180 Riggs, you crazy mother...!
5783700 5785380 Holy Christ!
5789700 5792060 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5792300 5793460 Thanks.
5794500 5796660 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
5797700 5799700 - I'm going to find him.<br />- What about Leo?
5799900 5801180 What about Leo?
5801380 5803220 You're on your own now.
5803500 5804820 What do you mean?
5805060 5808500 Take my car to the police station<br />and wait for the Federal Marshal.
5808740 5810740 It's been an experience knowing you.
5815220 5818420 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Go on. Lucky if you see him again.
5818660 5820340 I had a lot of fun.
5821020 5822740 You do your duty now.
5823020 5824860 I'm going to really get them now.
5825180 5826860 Listen. Wait.
5828100 5830100 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5832700 5834140 Loud as you want.
5834340 5836580 Really? Okay. Really?
5842420 5843940 Check it out.
5844180 5847540 Alba Varden is a cargo ship,<br />not a woman.
5847780 5851260 The Port Authority said<br />that the Alba Varden arrived today...
5851540 5854380 ...and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.
5856620 5858380 This is the eleventh dock.
5858620 5861620 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
5866820 5867780 The ship!
5868060 5869540 What did I tell you?
5871140 5874060 That container there<br />with three heavy hitters.
5874300 5875380 Let's have a look.
5877140 5879380 I'll take 2 of them out, you take 1.
5881180 5884820 Better yet, you take 2, I take 1.<br />Pull over to the side.
5932540 5935700 - I can't see shit!<br />- Me, either. What is this shit?
5935940 5937340 Got a light?
5939300 5941300 It's Rudd's, whatever it is.
5941540 5943540 I still can't see shit.
5945540 5948700 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5953860 5956220 Shit! Fort Knox!
5959820 5961660 Hell, how much is it?
5963500 5964820 Thousands.
5966500 5968460 Fucking millions.
5968820 5971500 Billions of fucking Donald Trump lotto.
5981820 5982700 Look at this.
5983340 5985380 These are $1,000 bills!
5987420 5991580 With what I'm holding in my hand<br />I could put all my kids through college.
5993100 5994020 Take it.
6001740 6003100 Fucking drug money.
6003340 6005020 Do something good with it.
6005260 6007700 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
6020380 6022100 Load the container.
6022380 6026020 The next time the sun hits<br />their bodies, they'll be in Cape Town.
6030220 6032900 - Hey, this thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
6033300 6035780 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
6036460 6038020 Let's shoot our way out.
6038220 6040300 No, don't. I got a better idea.
6094700 6096020 Our money.
6099300 6101260 Make sure they're dead.
6112300 6116140 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- You go first. I'll cover you.
6131300 6133500 - How do we get out of here?<br />- I'll go this way.
6133740 6136060 I'll go this way and check over here.
6220620 6221940 Oh, shit!
6351060 6352900 Riggs, you okay?
6369740 6370900 Drop it, asshole!
6377020 6379540 Diplomatic immunity!
6389860 6392220 It's just been revoked.
6470180 6472860 You're breathing. You're not dead.
6473620 6475180 No, don't die.
6476580 6478540 You're not dead until I tell you.
6479380 6483380 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6483620 6485140 You got that?
6485540 6488020 You' re not dead until I tell you.
6488540 6490540 Now, breathe with me.
6490820 6492140 Breathe.
6497540 6499540 Rog, in my pocket.
6507740 6512380 I want you to throw those things away.<br />Those things will kill you.
6519660 6521420 You son-of-a-bitch.
6523060 6524500 I thought you were dying.
