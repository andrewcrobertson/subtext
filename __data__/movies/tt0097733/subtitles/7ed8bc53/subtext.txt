0 2210 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
2460 4629 I like this pigsty.
4879 8883 When did you last do the refrigerator?<br />Or the pan under it?
9175 10552 There's a pan under there?
12470 14681 Where's my phone?
15598 17308 Where's my TV? What have you done?
17517 19436 Everything is outside.
19686 21312 Just stop what you're doing.
21563 24691 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
25066 26985 Out, out! Oh, man.
32365 34117 It's Collins.
34576 36369 Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
36661 37912 No. Why?
38204 41416 I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
42542 43960 I'll be right there.
49758 51509 Stay in the car.
59351 60810 I'm upstairs!
61227 63688 Should I call 999, officer in distress?
64898 66066 I'll cover the back!
66274 68735 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
86127 87337 In here.
102977 104020 Good morning.
111152 112737 First time in 20 years...
112987 115115 ...I get the bathroom to myself.
115323 118993 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
119327 122997 Just me and my new<br />Saltwater Sportsman magazine!
132549 136052 The one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
145270 149774 So I'm reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
150650 152402 ...when I glanced over.
157782 159534 Oh, Jesus.
160577 161619 Is that all?
161870 163329 You scared the shit out of me.
163538 165457 Scared the shit out of you?
167167 168543 How long you been here?
168752 170837 I've been here all night.
171171 174132 My legs are so numb<br />I don't know if I can...
174424 175800 Don't move.
176051 177260 I can't.
177552 179512 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
181389 184059 It's a dirty job,<br />but someone's got to do it.
199449 200658 Tell me I'm not fucked.
202243 203620 He's fucked.
205914 208333 Okay, but I'd be lying.
209959 211920 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
212170 213546 That's a relief.
213922 216174 - I have to get help.<br />- No way!
216508 217550 Why?
220345 222722 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
222972 226935 This is serious.<br />I got to get the bomb squad here.
227227 228353 Bomb squad?
234484 236695 Okay, call them in.
239656 242242 Don't use the open frequency.
248206 250250 Let's try to keep this quiet, okay?
250959 252877 Sure. Trust me.
272689 274441 An escort is really not necessary.
274774 278445 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
278862 282532 I have helped policemen<br />through very traumatic moments.
282782 286286 There is nothing in this room<br />that I cannot handle.
289414 290790 I was wrong.
291499 292876 Excuse me.
297422 300133 I should've known,<br />where there's one, there's the other.
309184 311269 You're a psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
311686 313396 It's ready to come out.
316024 318109 I got to live in this house!
320445 321571 Clear this room.
323490 324491 Come on, Riggs.
329162 329954 You, too, Riggs.
330205 331164 No.
332707 334626 Riggs, out.
342342 343510 All right.
346388 347681 Dive into the tub.
349265 351685 Then pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
352185 356147 This cast iron tub<br />will withstand a hell of a blast.
356731 357732 I can't.
357941 361236 He can't.<br />He's been on there for 18 hours.
361528 363279 He can't even walk.
363530 365407 I'm gonna have to help him.
366282 368034 All right, you better wear this.
369619 370453 The nitrogen?
370954 371830 Almost there.
375792 379337 He's spraying this thing<br />with liquid nitrogen...
379671 382632 ...to give you 1 or 2 seconds<br />before detonation.
382924 385719 - Got that?<br />- 2 seconds. Thanks a lot.
386052 387429 Lights out.
387679 389264 Get him up and out.
398106 399357 Good luck.
399816 401359 You got a piece?
401609 403695 - Yeah, a Smith and Wesson.<br />- Try this one.
403987 406281 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
408158 409534 Good luck.
424341 426134 Alone at last.
427510 430472 Why didn't they plant the bomb<br />in Trish's stove?
431014 434309 All the needless suffering<br />could have ended there.
448406 450075 I'm going to die on a toilet.
450825 453286 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
453495 456456 And I'm here<br />and I don't plan on going now.
459000 460293 Let's do it.
467467 471012 On three.<br />Wait, let me get into the tub.
471888 473807 I'm just going to give you...
474265 477102 On three, huh? What do you say?
479270 480772 One...
481564 482816 ...two...
483108 484067 Wait.
486152 488738 Do we do it on three, or...
489447 490949 ...one, two, three...
491199 495036 ...then do it?<br />- It's your ass. It's up to you.
496329 498164 My ass, yeah.
498415 499541 Three.
500041 501459 We go on three?
501668 504087 One, two and then three!
507716 508842 One...
509092 510427 Martin?
517767 519310 I know.
520061 521479 I mean it, man.
524983 526443 I hear you.
529070 531406 We're not going to die, all right?
532741 533992 On three.
570528 574074 Get off me. I don't want anybody<br />to see us like this.
577952 579537 Mr. Jones?
580330 581289 Sit down.
585126 587337 What can I do for you today?
587587 590799 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
591049 593385 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
593718 595970 Of course, I can help him do that.
597097 598765 I want you to talk him out of it.
599724 600684 Talk him out of it?
601476 602977 Whatever for?
603561 607315 This is a bad time for him to go,<br />with all the trouble.
607941 610860 Have him come back later<br />in the week and we'll sit down...
611945 613530 He's here.
613780 615949 Yeah, he's here now. Alphonse?
626835 628670 There must be some mistake.
631214 632298 Say, what?
635176 638888 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
639097 641850 I don't think you want to go<br />to South Africa.
642142 643226 Why not?
646563 647939 Because you're black.
651359 652694 You are.
652944 654279 He is.
654946 657824 Of course I am black.<br />That's why I want to go.
658700 661161 To join my brothers in the struggle...
661369 663371 ...against the racist...
663580 664330 ...fascist...
664539 665957 ...white minority regime!
666249 667250 Fascist regime!
667500 668710 One man, one vote!
669961 672380 Free South Africa, you son-of-a-bitch!
674049 677594 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />You must leave.
679763 684267 What's happening?<br />Don't touch me! Back off!
688021 690357 Close the security gate! Quickly!
704204 705872 End apartheid now!
707374 710502 You going to arrest me<br />if I don't shut up?
724599 728478 One man, one vote!<br />Free South Africa! Give me that flag!
731356 732524 You can't push me out!
798923 800800 You call this security?
801051 805263 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
809351 811144 Wait, gentlemen!
811353 813730 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
815482 816983 I should have known.
819861 821196 Well, well.
821988 823114 The master race.
825742 828620 I hope you realize<br />the trouble you are in right now.
829329 834501 As usual, you people have everything<br />upside down and turned around.
834751 835960 Gentlemen...
836670 839464 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
845011 845887 Fingers off.
846179 847472 Hands off!
848848 850225 Let me see that.
853395 857357 That's a piece of hardware you got.<br />Where do you get that stuff?
857732 860777 I've never seen it.<br />Where's it from, South Africa?
862821 863571 Don't move.
871121 876167 You haven't heard about me? I got a<br />bad reputation. Sometimes I go nuts.
878169 878795 Don't move.
884467 887345 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
887637 889723 Whatever the fuck your name is.
890598 892517 You fold up your tents...
893059 895061 ...and get out of my country...
895562 897647 ...and I won't do anything to you.
898440 900025 I'll leave you alone.
900233 904279 'Cause if you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
904529 907282 Send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
908867 910952 Just get out of here...
911661 913580 ...Kaffir lover.
920545 921755 Eenie...
922630 923340 ...meenie...
924007 924841 ...miney...
927135 928053 Hey, Moe!
932182 933933 Sorry, Adolf.
936353 938104 Pick them up with your hands.
939939 943318 Big smile. Big smile!
945737 947822 Vorstedt, come here.
948281 949491 Vorstedt!
953745 956873 - Hello, Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
957165 958541 What are you doing here?
958792 962087 I've been with your boss...<br />shooting the breeze.
962462 964005 Shooting his fish.
977227 981523 The guy goes,<br />"But, but, but... you're black!"
984901 986277 He's black.
986986 988321 No shit.
988947 990115 He started some shit!
990407 992033 You get into Rudd's office?
992283 993702 I got up there.
993952 998998 Aryan Crud and his Brown Shirts<br />turned up, but I ripped this off a pad.
999624 1002627 "Alba Varden, Thursday." Alba Varden?
1003420 1005088 Isn't that Hitler's girlfriend?
1005338 1006631 That's Eva Braun.
1006923 1008842 He has a date with her Thursday.
1009092 1010969 Her name sounds familiar.
1011344 1015682 I don't know her.<br />It just sounds familiar. Alba Varden.
1016016 1018810 A deli! Let's eat. I'm starving.
1019436 1020395 I'll spring.
1020645 1022647 Let's go. Sounds good.
1028153 1031072 - Get out the other side, Leo.<br />- It's okay!
1031948 1032824 No cars.
1055013 1056723 That policeman.
1068485 1070320 You should pick from the bottom.
1070570 1072322 They put the old stuff on top.
1072572 1073698 Officer Riggs!
1076034 1078078 I followed you from the consulate.
1078411 1079537 You followed me?
1079829 1084042 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush, too.
1086127 1088046 I wanted to apologize...
1088380 1091341 ...for the other day,<br />if we frightened you.
1091716 1094636 I was a bit startled by all those guns.
1095178 1098139 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you, too.
1099015 1100558 Thank me for what?
1105605 1108066 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
1109275 1112737 I don't like many things<br />about my boss and my country.
1113613 1115532 But I like my job very much.
1115865 1118076 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
1118326 1119536 You like this town?
1121287 1122497 That's a new one.
1123707 1126835 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
1127127 1128628 Rika Van Haagen-Dazs.
1128962 1131756 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van den Haas. It's Dutch.
1132215 1133675 That's real pretty.
1138263 1139806 You got a rabbit at home?
1140056 1141307 It's mine.
1141725 1142934 Shop one day at a time?
1143309 1144811 Good police work, officer.
1145103 1147022 I get paid for that.
1147313 1149357 I don't shop for the entire week.
1149566 1150859 Why not?
1151735 1154654 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
1156406 1158867 Wait. Have dinner with me.
1160160 1164581 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
1165165 1170420 A beautiful sunset. Come on,<br />be original. Everyone else says no.
1170754 1173131 Come to my place. I'm a gourmet cook.
1173423 1174674 Let go of the basket.
1174883 1175842 I'll scream.
1178303 1181639 I'll embarrass you in public.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
1181973 1184434 - Come on with me.<br />- No, no, please.
1184684 1188772 Let go of my bag! Look what she's<br />doing! Somebody call a cop!
1190106 1191566 What are you doing?
1191816 1194152 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
1194444 1195987 You are a cop.
1205121 1207540 You must be an honest cop.
1207916 1212087 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
1215215 1217801 I did exaggerate<br />about one thing, though.
1218009 1221471 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
1221805 1224933 - Like it with crushed Oreos?<br />- Of course.
1225308 1227102 A woman after my own heart.
1227727 1229312 Watch your step.
1229979 1231398 Sam wants in.
1231731 1235902 Here, sit down.<br />Oh, wait a minute. A little filthy.
1246538 1248915 I have no wine. How about a beer?
1249124 1250125 That's fine.
1250875 1252377 She drinks beer.
1270186 1272605 What's the matter?<br />You got a dirty glass?
1274357 1276443 Oh, it's the wedding ring.
1278194 1279904 I used to be married.
1280155 1281156 Not any more?
1283241 1284617 Not any more.
1288455 1289998 I've got something on the stove.
1294711 1298173 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials, isn't he?
1300091 1303219 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
1304971 1306681 He's not a very nice guy.
1309267 1310894 Whatever he's doing...
1311394 1313146 ...he shouldn't get away with it.
1321946 1323531 How's it hanging, Wyler?
1323782 1326701 - What do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
1327077 1328787 Easy, easy.
1329329 1333500 Tell me something. Have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
1333792 1336544 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
1336795 1338254 No, you were a cop.
1338838 1340215 Hurry up, honey.
1340465 1344636 I'm going to take a couple laps<br />before I go to the station.
1401192 1404738 Sam, take a hike.<br />No Stooges tonight. Go on.
1427844 1429346 Get that beer in here.
1429596 1430972 Don't worry about it.
1431264 1433350 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
1433767 1434976 I'm out.
1435352 1436728 Put some music on.
1446112 1447530 Who's not accounted for?
1447781 1449199 Riggs and Murtaugh.
1449449 1453078 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
1453370 1455455 - And Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in yet.
1455705 1457874 Get on the radio and find them!
1458124 1462295 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
1462587 1466591 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
1467175 1468551 Sorry, Captain.
1475892 1477352 Get me Riggs.
1484734 1486319 I'll get that.
1488738 1489698 Wrong number.
1502335 1507340 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game<br />and I was feeling real lucky.
1508216 1512554 Okay, so what I see are nice,<br />conservative tax returns.
1512929 1515640 Everything by the book,<br />black and white.
1515849 1519269 So you just need to play around<br />in the gray areas...
1519519 1521438 ...if you want to see some bucks.
1521813 1525400 On your salary, there's not much<br />to do but you need deductions.
1525608 1527152 - My boat.<br />- You can't deduct it.
1527360 1528820 No, it's the bill of sale.
1529029 1530739 I know, but you can't do it.
1531740 1533950 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
1534242 1535452 To my house.
1535827 1537328 Because of my boat.
1537579 1539289 Look at this commercial.
1539497 1542751 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
1543126 1547630 What are you doing? I want to look<br />at the girl! Why'd you do that?
1547881 1549799 I didn't hear you say that.
1550091 1551468 Say what? She's great.
1551718 1554512 She makes me want to buy rubbers.
1564064 1566483 Time for the seventh inning stretch.
1571029 1572947 That's a baseball expression.
1573281 1574657 I know.
1575533 1577994 But we're only up to the fourth inning.
1583708 1585210 Batter up.
1595053 1596513 Stay in the car.
1597472 1599557 I'll only be a minute, okay?
1600433 1603561 Stay in the car? It's cold.<br />You have no door.
1603853 1607148 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat.
1610527 1614531 Don't touch anything.<br />Nothing. I mean nothing!
1617659 1621287 Alba Varden. Why do I know the name?
1622163 1624249 It's here. It's got to be.
1624958 1628712 - Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, another hobby. What's new?
1635051 1636636 That's the day on my boat.
1639347 1641141 It's not there. Where is it?
1641850 1643393 My birthday.
1673298 1674716 I'll be damned.
1675091 1678386 Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.
1679846 1682015 Leo, I told you to stay in the car!
1682724 1683308 Shit!
1752335 1753837 Nailed them both.
1768143 1769519 My car!
1772647 1774024 Leo!
1834751 1838755 Get up, get dressed.<br />Get dressed. Come on.
1844260 1848682 - I don't understand.<br />- Just trust me. I got a bad feeling.
1918335 1921379 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the front seat.
1921671 1924799 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck!
1925050 1927427 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
1927635 1931139 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!<br />Stay out of the light!
1980438 1982065 The master race.
2011594 2015473 You shit! Who were those people?
2015765 2019894 You tell me. Was it your husband?<br />What are you doing Saturday?
2031322 2032657 It's Sam!
2036202 2037037 Head down!
2056389 2058641 Come on, Sam!
2059601 2061144 Come on, Sam.
2061519 2063063 Shake a leg.
2063271 2064147 You made it.
2068193 2069944 Has he got any holes in him?
2072030 2074449 Oh, you clever dog.
2081247 2084542 I promised to have you home by 11.
2084918 2088213 This is the most incredible first date<br />I've ever been on.
2088505 2090048 Wait until the second one.
2090298 2093510 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
2094594 2097013 This is a very nice building.
2097597 2100141 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
2100392 2102310 You can stay right here.
2103436 2104312 I can?
2104562 2107273 Yes, there's<br />a vacant apartment up there.
2110193 2111111 I'm kidding.
2111569 2113196 You can stay with me.
2113738 2114823 Tonight?
2115115 2118993 Yes, tonight. And tomorrow night.<br />And the night after that.
2119619 2120787 And after that?
2121037 2122914 Don't push your luck.
2130296 2132132 I better go.
2133466 2136219 Go inside and lock all the doors<br />and stay there.
2136511 2139014 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
2139514 2142308 There's better ways of staying<br />in LA than working there.
2143018 2145437 All right. I've just quit.
2171463 2175800 I'll just grab a few things...<br />Hell, I haven't got anything.
2176176 2177969 Just bring yourself.
2181264 2182849 I better go.
2201534 2202786 Go home!
2218510 2219886 Go get the girl.
2242283 2245704 I would offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
2246037 2247288 ...you're on the wagon.
2247539 2249457 That stuff will kill you quick.
2249958 2253086 You know so much about me,<br />who are you?
2257674 2260343 I changed the course of your life.
2261302 2263013 Four years ago...
2263304 2265640 ...when you was a narc at Long Beach...
2265932 2269394 ...you were getting too close,<br />so we put a contract out on you.
2269644 2271563 I handled it myself.
2271855 2274691 Drove your car right off the road,<br />remember?
2275150 2278111 But you weren't driving, were you?
2278445 2280697 You can't imagine the surprise...
2281573 2286619 ...when I pulled back a matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
2288580 2289831 Your wife, right?
2292500 2294711 She didn't die straight away.
2296338 2297839 It took a bit of time.
2305472 2307849 You don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
2472764 2474724 She's dead. They killed her.
2475225 2476393 Where are you?
2476643 2481064 They killed her. She's dead.<br />They killed them both.
2481272 2485110 Slow down. Who are you talking about?<br />Where are you?
2485360 2487278 She's dead, Roger.
2489197 2493326 Calm down. We'll take care of it.<br />Where are you?
2493868 2496663 I'm not a cop tonight. It's personal.
2497914 2501126 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
2502168 2506923 I'm going to get those bastards.<br />I'm going to fuck them. I'm going now.
2507882 2511928 We're not going to the stilt house!<br />We're under orders!
2512137 2514514 Then the house will have to come to me.
2514764 2517017 They killed them both.
2517350 2520020 They got Rika and they got my wife.
2526443 2527444 Shit.
2541666 2542792 What's the deal?
2543793 2546755 You talk to the Feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
2546963 2548298 That's not fair.
2552469 2554054 We trusted you.
2556222 2558016 You betrayed us.
2559642 2560685 You took our money!
2564856 2566024 We want it back now...
2566274 2568902 ...you slimy little shit.
2570695 2572947 Give him more. He likes it.
2608191 2610235 Don't try and stop me.
2610610 2613363 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
2614197 2616700 They declared war on the police.
2617826 2619411 You know about that?
2619661 2622080 I heard it on the radio.
2622789 2625125 We don't have the authority.
2625375 2626584 Cavanaugh...
2626793 2628878 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
2630422 2634551 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
2636720 2638179 You got a plan?
2642809 2645311 Drive around the front of the house...
2645729 2647647 ...wait for my signal...
2648857 2651484 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
2651901 2652861 They got Leo.
2655488 2656614 Be careful.
2664748 2665665 Wait.
2666041 2667042 What's your signal?
2668710 2670712 You'll know when it happens.
2673715 2676301 Somehow I think I will know.
2725934 2726976 Feel like talking?
2733233 2734401 It's the big one!
2739280 2741157 Cool it. Watch him.
2741408 2742992 Move me away from the windows!
2817275 2819694 Riggs, you crazy mother...!
2836920 2838672 Holy Christ!
2843176 2845637 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
2845887 2847097 Thanks.
2848181 2850433 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
2851518 2853603 - I'm going to find him.<br />- What about Leo?
2853812 2855146 What about Leo?
2855355 2857273 You're on your own now.
2857565 2858942 What do you mean?
2859192 2862779 Take my car to the police station<br />and wait for the Federal Marshal.
2863029 2865115 It's been an experience knowing you.
2869786 2873123 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Go on. Lucky if you see him again.
2873373 2875125 I had a lot of fun.
2875834 2877627 You do your duty now.
2877919 2879838 I'm going to really get them now.
2880171 2881923 Listen. Wait.
2883216 2885301 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
2888013 2889514 Loud as you want.
2889723 2892058 Really? Okay. Really?
2898148 2899733 Check it out.
2899983 2903486 Alba Varden is a cargo ship,<br />not a woman.
2903737 2907365 The Port Authority said<br />that the Alba Varden arrived today...
2907657 2910618 ...and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.
2912954 2914789 This is the eleventh dock.
2915040 2918168 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
2923590 2924591 The ship!
2924883 2926426 What did I tell you?
2928094 2931139 That container there<br />with three heavy hitters.
2931389 2932515 Let's have a look.
2934351 2936686 I'll take 2 of them out, you take 1.
2938563 2942359 Better yet, you take 2, I take 1.<br />Pull over to the side.
2992117 2995412 - I can't see shit!<br />- Me, either. What is this shit?
2995662 2997122 Got a light?
2999165 3001251 It's Rudd's, whatever it is.
3001501 3003586 I still can't see shit.
3005672 3008967 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
3014347 3016808 Shit! Fort Knox!
3020562 3022480 Hell, how much is it?
3024399 3025775 Thousands.
3027527 3029571 Fucking millions.
3029946 3032741 Billions of fucking Donald Trump lotto.
3043501 3044419 Look at this.
3045086 3047213 These are $1,000 bills!
3049341 3053678 With what I'm holding in my hand<br />I could put all my kids through college.
3055263 3056222 Take it.
3064272 3065690 Fucking drug money.
3065940 3067692 Do something good with it.
3067942 3070487 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
3083708 3085502 Load the container.
3085794 3089589 The next time the sun hits<br />their bodies, they'll be in Cape Town.
3093968 3096763 - Hey, this thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
3097180 3099766 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
3100475 3102102 Let's shoot our way out.
3102310 3104479 No, don't. I got a better idea.
3161202 3162579 Our money.
3165999 3168043 Make sure they're dead.
3179554 3183558 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- You go first. I'll cover you.
3199366 3201659 - How do we get out of here?<br />- I'll go this way.
3201910 3204329 I'll go this way and check over here.
3292500 3293877 Oh, shit!
3428511 3430430 Riggs, you okay?
3447989 3449199 Drop it, asshole!
3455580 3458208 Diplomatic immunity!
3468968 3471429 It's just been revoked.
3552719 3555513 You're breathing. You're not dead.
3556306 3557932 No, don't die.
3559392 3561436 You're not dead until I tell you.
3562312 3566483 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
3566733 3568318 You got that?
3568735 3571321 You' re not dead until I tell you.
3571863 3573948 Now, breathe with me.
3574240 3575617 Breathe.
3581247 3583333 Rog, in my pocket.
3591883 3596721 I want you to throw those things away.<br />Those things will kill you.
3604312 3606147 You son-of-a-bitch.
3607857 3609359 I thought you were dying.
3609609 3613238 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not going to die in your arms.
3613446 3615156 You son-of-a-bitch.
3620245 3623957 Where are they? Are they all gone?<br />Did you get the bad guys?
3624207 3626584 They been dekaffirnated.
3635802 3638430 Don't make me laugh! Jesus!
3641391 3643643 Did anyone ever tell you...
3645812 3648273 ...you really are a beautiful man?
3653611 3655196 Give us a kiss.
3657449 3659200 Where'd that bullet hit you?
