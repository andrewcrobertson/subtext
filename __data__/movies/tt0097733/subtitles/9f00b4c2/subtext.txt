32949 34909 -Floor this thing!<br />-It's my wife's.
35117 37869 -I won't go faster.<br />-You're doing 65 now.
38079 39622 657! Shit!
39872 42624 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
45336 48630 We're eastbound on Fourth,<br />in pursuit of a red BMW...
48839 50423 ...driver Caucasian, blond.
50633 52926 Plate "2-4-Adam-Henry-174."
54845 58139 DISPATCHER: You are westbound on<br />Second. 20-William-12's southbound...
58349 61852 ...approaching Second.<br />You're heading right for each other.
62061 63979 -Somebody back off.<br />-Got it!
64188 66815 -What'd she say?<br />-We're about to have an accident.
67817 70861 RIGGS: You're gonna get us killed!<br />MURTAUGH: Shit! I'm--
86043 90005 We'll stick with this red<br />son of a bitch. You chase the blue.
90256 93842 20-William-15, that's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
94093 98388 -What's the pursuit?<br />-20-William-15 and 20-William-12.
98848 100683 -Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />-And the squad.
100891 103476 -$20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />-Who's driving?
103686 105312 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
105563 108691 I knew nothing about the wife's<br />station wagon. Bet's off!
108899 109941 Shut up!

120911 123371 What fucking language is that?
123581 124748 It's German.
125249 126291 Japanese?
126459 129420 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.
129629 130671 They own everything.

146771 148481 Shots are being fired.
149148 150774 Thanks for the scoop.
151108 153777 The son of a bitch shot<br />my wife's windshield.
153986 156446 Entering the pursuit.<br />Westbound on Third and Hill.
168668 171379 Shit, man!<br />We're splitting up!
175800 178010 Son of a bitch!<br />Now we're cooking!
181597 182973 -Damn it.<br />-Step on it!

247872 249164 So is Riggs, on foot!
253002 256171 Hey, Riggs!<br />Get your slow ass in here!
256380 258090 Get in here. Now!
258424 259466 Only if I drive.
259633 261301 -Move over, I'll drive.<br />-Go around.
261510 263887 No, go around. I'm driving.
264180 265556 I'll drive.
267266 269726 Did you get a make<br />on that red Beemer yet?
270019 271437 Not a scratch, you hear?
276734 278235 -You're not gonna make it.<br />- I will.
278527 279861 There's no room!
280070 281613 You're not gonna make it!
282740 285242 Look at my side panel!
295211 297713 Goddamn it, you were right, you know.
298047 300132 There wasn't enough room.
315940 318317 Get down! Get down!

373455 375290 Get out of the way!
390139 391682 This was a new car, Riggs.
392141 393183 It still is.
400858 402025 On three.
402693 403735 One...
404320 406238 . two. .. three!

423380 426299 -You come on "three"!<br />-It's "three," then go!
426550 428301 No! We always go on "three"!

454078 455996 That's a lot of money.
459625 461168 MURTAUGH:<br />What is this?
462044 463670 It's gold!
464088 465422 Fucking gold!
465631 467633 -Krugerrands.<br />-It's illegal.
467800 471053 -You can't import this into the country.<br />-You're right.
471595 475098 The damage you caused comes<br />out of the department's budget.
475307 479227 -Pay it off in Krugerrands.<br />-Don't make jokes, make arrests.
479436 481563 You came up empty,<br />I want an explanation.
481772 485525 -Things got out of hand.<br />-You said it was a routine bust.
485776 490276 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands--
491073 493241 This was bigger than we thought.

501333 505337 I worked psycho ward, Riggs.<br />You'll never get out.
505754 508131 One minute, 15 seconds.
508382 510342 Shapiro, scratch my nose.

556972 557973 Well...
558182 561810 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />I can do it whenever I want to now.
562019 563562 Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?
563854 565772 Yeah, it does.
566482 568108 But not as much as...

583165 585792 My door is always open, sergeant.
586502 590339 I think we ought to keep this<br />on a professional level, don't you?
591256 594092 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
594384 597261 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
597554 599973 And I need the money.<br />Cough up!
602810 605646 It's not all here yet.<br />I want it all. I want the lot.

924089 926341 What's with you?<br />She looked beautiful.
926550 930262 I liked it. She made me want<br />to buy rubbers right now.

952075 955411 Yeah, but it's an old gun,<br />and he's not a very good shot.

1018433 1019809 Yeah, that's all.
1020101 1021602 Good, good.
1025106 1027942 However, we did lose over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.

1036952 1039955 Sometimes these things<br />do not go as planned.
1040664 1044167 As you say, they just happen,<br />eh, Pieter?
1052342 1055511 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word "drop cloth."
1056471 1060475 Certain policemen in this city<br />have become an intolerable nuisance.
1061142 1065642 They are obviously onto us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1065814 1067315 Warn them off.
1069025 1070651 It's my experience...
1071486 1074572 ...that a scared cop is<br />more useful than a dead one.

1076491 1078326 Is that not a bit tame?
1078827 1080161 Depends how you do it.
1081997 1083999 Then you'd better look at this.

1104352 1107188 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.

1108898 1110190 This yours?
1111192 1112693 I found it in the wash.
1114029 1115071 Yeah.
1117365 1118366 Thanks.
1119409 1120952 I keep on losing this.
1122078 1123204 Something's wrong.
1123413 1127041 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1129961 1131337 What about the pen?
1131755 1133715 It just reminds me of something.
1134716 1135883 Reminds you of what?
1136718 1138219 It reminds me of...
1138553 1140388 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1141598 1142890 I didn't mean to push.
1144434 1147145 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1152150 1156571 I was supposed to meet her for dinner,<br />one of those romantic dinners for two.
1156780 1158156 I had so much work.
1160575 1162451 I forgot about the whole thing.
1164162 1168457 She waited at the restaurant for<br />an hour before she drove home alone.
1170085 1174255 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone, so I answered it.
1174464 1176924 They told me she was killed<br />in a car crash.
1182430 1185766 I should've been driving.<br />We'd have been all right.
1188144 1192106 I remember falling down on my knees,<br />and I started shaking all over.
1192315 1195192 I remember thinking,<br />"I'm just losing it."
1196277 1198904 So there I was,<br />lying on the living room floor.
1200115 1203952 Lying there, and I'm seeing under<br />the couch, and I see this gold pen...
1205120 1206412 ...just lying there.
1206621 1210333 I'd been looking for it everywhere<br />for two months. There it is.
1212127 1214212 She wasn't much of a housekeeper.
1215922 1219467 This voice goes off inside my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1220468 1222845 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1224222 1226557 I didn't feel like it,<br />but I got up.
1226808 1228684 Muscles were still working.
1228977 1231479 Then I drove to the hospital...
1231980 1234983 ...identified her<br />and signed her out with my gold pen.
1235191 1238485 Gold pen? Trish found<br />a gold pen in the laundry.

1254169 1256004 ...this'll all be yours.
1259466 1262552 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1263344 1265596 A man could live here and be happy.
1269851 1273688 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?
1273897 1275690 Let's go watch some TV.
1364946 1366280 Kaffirs!
1369576 1371119 Wondering about your kids?
1372287 1374455 You wondering what we done to them?
1375456 1377958 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1379127 1381337 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1382297 1384007 Want to know what we done?
1384382 1385424 Shall I tell you?
1387468 1390137 You just let your imagination<br />run riot.
1390847 1392807 This has just been a warning.
1393141 1396894 After this, it gets bloody.<br />You tell your people to back off.
1397145 1398813 Don't be a smart kaffir.
1399480 1402316 Maybe we let you live, huh?<br />Come on, let's go.
1413828 1415913 Are you all right?
1422170 1425173 RIGGS: You didn't see a face?<br />MURTAUGH: No. They all had on hoods.
1425340 1426632 What about a voice?
1426841 1431341 That motherfucker who did talk had a<br />strange accent. I couldn't place it.
1431638 1433264 Not German, not English.
1433514 1436350 Kind of guttural.<br />You know, a shitty accent.
1436517 1440020 Anything like what we were chasing<br />the other night?
1440271 1442690 Yeah, kind of like that.
1443149 1444525 Trish and the kids?
1444734 1447653 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1447862 1452199 Listen up. You all heard about<br />what happened to Rog last night?
1452450 1454452 Forensics get back with anything?
1454702 1456787 Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.
1457163 1460457 The point being, we gotta watch<br />each other's backs and fronts.
1460708 1464545 You're all invited to watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1464754 1467757 -If we catch these assholes.<br />-Count me in.
1473388 1476057 I got something special for you boys.
1476224 1479227 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1479394 1483189 You guys are gonna babysit him<br />until Washington sends the feds.
1483481 1486609 -How long?<br />-Soon as the red tape is processed.
1486818 1488069 Three days.
1488403 1492490 This guy Getz is gonna testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1492740 1494908 Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.
1495410 1497286 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1498913 1500581 This is not a shit assignment.
1500915 1502917 -Yes, it is.<br />ED: No, it isn't.
1503126 1505086 -It isn't.<br />-It's a shit assignment.
1505253 1506754 Shut up, the both of you.
1507005 1508089 Here you go, sir.
1508297 1510757 -I guaranteed this guy's safety.<br />-Why us?
1510925 1514261 Because you two are<br />the most qualified for the job.
1514512 1517431 And after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1517598 1518932 I can handle last night.
1520143 1521435 What do we do with him?
1521644 1523937 How should I know?<br />Take him to Disneyland.
1524147 1525940 This stinks. This stinks.
1526149 1527358 I don't give a fuck.
1527608 1530736 I don't have an ulcer,<br />because I know when to say that.
1530945 1533447 Here's where he's staying.<br />It's a nice hotel.
1533614 1536950 Expenses are paid by the Justice<br />Department, so enjoy yourselves.
1537285 1539620 And Riggs, one more thing.
1542498 1543540 Know what that says?
1543958 1546627 Same thing as that.<br />But I don't give a fuck.
1550631 1553467 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1562810 1564019 Excuse me.
1564479 1566147 What room is that for?
1566314 1567356 612.
1570193 1571986 This is it. 612.
1574655 1575989 MAN: Who is it?<br />-Police.
1576699 1577991 How do I know that?
1578326 1581829 After I shoot you through the door,<br />you can examine the bullet.
1583664 1585832 Don't you want to see a badge?
1586042 1587501 -Where's your badge?<br />-Shut up.
1587668 1590045 I get it.<br />Bad cop, good cop.
1590463 1591839 Shut up!
1593049 1595342 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1595510 1598513 -Are you Leo Getz?<br />-That's me, Leo Getz.
1598721 1602266 Whatever you need, Leo gets.<br />You get it?
1602725 1605519 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1605853 1607855 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.<br />This is Sgt. Riggs.
1608022 1611275 How you doing? Nice to meet you.<br />What do I call you guys?
1611526 1614779 -Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.<br />-We're gonna be your shadow.
1617031 1619033 That's all right.<br />An old-fashioned--!
1620409 1623495 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1623704 1626540 I didn't think anybody<br />used those things anymore.
1626707 1629793 I'll bet you the kid's got<br />an automatic. Got an automatic?
1630044 1631211 Yep, a Beretta.
1631379 1632630 Don't touch it.
1633548 1635049 You sure you guys are cops?
1636050 1639720 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm the state's star witness.
1641264 1643015 We'll take that room.
1643766 1647728 Actually, I already have my stuff<br />in this room. You know, when I...
1652900 1655777 Okay, okay. It's yours.<br />My stuff's gone.
1656028 1658238 I'll move it in the small room, okay?
1658656 1662117 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1662326 1665787 Come on, loosen up a little, guys.<br />We'll be together a long time.
1666080 1667247 [KNOCKING]
1667415 1668416 I'll get it.
1669542 1671794 It's only room service.
1672086 1674671 You hungry? I'll call<br />and get anything you want.
1674922 1677424 See this silk robe?<br />Silk pajamas? Free!
1677592 1679260 -It's not free.<br />-Yes, it is!
1679427 1682555 -It's taxpayers' money.<br />-Oh, God! It's the same thing.
1686142 1687685 Good morning, gentlemen.
1691606 1695318 That's my food! You guys didn't<br />want anything. Bring it here.
1696110 1697778 It's mine. Boy!
1698112 1700447 You could've had anything you wanted.
1701115 1702825 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1708956 1710499 Martin, not the window!
1713336 1714462 Shit!
1740154 1741613 Where is that son of a bitch?
1743491 1746160 RIGGS: Somebody stop that guy!<br />Stop him!
1747995 1751331 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1751999 1753750 RIGGS:<br />Get off me!
1754001 1755002 Get off me!
1757004 1761504 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back.
1762009 1764344 Clear, move it! Get back! Police!
1765388 1766430 You all right?
1766639 1769391 I'm okay.<br />Why didn't you follow me down?
1769642 1772019 -Why didn't you?<br />-I was seven floors up!
1773354 1774438 He hit me.
1774689 1775690 Good!
1776065 1777649 Leo.
1777858 1780735 This guy took an awful chance<br />to pop all of us.
1780945 1782738 Did you witness a murder?
1782947 1785074 No, nothing like that. Honest.
1787535 1792035 All I did was, I laundered<br />half a billion dollars in drug money.
1793207 1795209 Half a billion dollars?
1795418 1799046 Give or take a few.<br />Who could count with that much money?
1799297 1802717 Could I please have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1803217 1804885 Could you please shut up?
1805553 1808389 -You're supposed to take care of me.<br />-Shut up!
1809181 1813310 Mr. Getz got away. Our best<br />opportunity, and he gets away.
1813561 1818061 He slips right through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1818899 1820233 What are you doing?
1821068 1824571 Just checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1825281 1827199 LEO:<br />Okay, I got it. Okay, here.
1827616 1831202 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1831412 1833997 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1834332 1835499 I bring it to you.
1836917 1839920 -He does.<br />-Me? I don't understand. Why me?
1840296 1841463 Who am I?
1841756 1843257 I'll tell you.
1843424 1845801 You're a courier. You work for him.
1846093 1847928 I'm the drug dealer.
1851140 1854935 Don't you have plates?<br />Here. Come on. What is this?
1856771 1861271 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1862610 1865779 Then I issue you a cashier's check<br />in his name...
1866155 1868740 ...minus a small commission<br />for myself.
1869784 1871494 -You like breathing?<br />-How much?
1871744 1872870 Two percent.
1873454 1876623 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1878626 1881837 You give it back to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1882046 1885632 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1885841 1886883 How's that work?
1887051 1889678 How's what? That's it!<br />Don't you get it?
1889887 1893807 It's your money. You don't pay<br />it back. It's yours, and it's clean!
1894016 1896268 It is now laundered.
1897686 1899979 You cops aren't too bright, are you?
1900147 1901565 Okay, okay, okay.
1901816 1903984 This is the best part. You got it?
1904568 1907362 You take a tax deduction...
1907988 1911366 ...on interest payments<br />that you don't even make.
1912827 1915329 -Am I a genius?<br />-You're a swindler.
1915496 1916497 Cheat!
1916705 1918039 Come on.
1918499 1921043 Everybody cheats.<br />Look at the Pentagon.
1921335 1922586 So you got it?
1924588 1927674 Okay, Mr. Big Shot,<br />how come you turned yourself in?
1928175 1930385 I was scamming those guys for months.
1930845 1932763 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1932930 1933972 You?
1934390 1936558 It was easy.<br />All those cash deposits.
1936892 1940186 Millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1940354 1943523 Who's gonna miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1944442 1945860 Drug dealers.
1946444 1948070 That's right. They did.
1948446 1951115 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1953701 1955369 You can give that to Nick.
1955911 1959039 I'll bet you it's softer.<br />I put fabric softener in.
1959206 1960248 It's small, Leroy.
1960458 1964628 It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if<br />you want, I'll buy you another shirt!
1964879 1967840 Do me a favor. Give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1968048 1971843 I don't know any drug dealers.<br />All I dealt with was couriers.
1972052 1976056 -Where does Trish keep my laundry?<br />MURTAUGH: On the shelf in back.
1977433 1979893 You never met anyone except couriers?
1981479 1982897 No names.
1986150 1989236 Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br />Come to think of it...
1989570 1990612 Okay, listen.
1990946 1994866 They took me up to the hills<br />in this house with stilts on it.
1995075 1997952 And I had a job interview<br />with a guy...
1998245 2000247 ...and his name was...
2001165 2002749 ...Haynes. Hans!
2002917 2005252 -Take us there.<br />-We have to sit on this guy.
2005461 2007296 It won't do any harm to look.
2007671 2009798 - I know the address.<br />-Let's go.
2009965 2011007 We shouldn't!

2018390 2021101 If we're going,<br />shouldn't I have a gun?
2021268 2022310 No!
2023687 2026189 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2026440 2028108 I'm sorry about that.

2450072 2452866 These gentlemen also work<br />for the consulate.
2453033 2455368 We have diplomatic credentials--
2457371 2458997 Keep your hands high.
2463001 2464293 Give me that.
2467589 2470425 Everybody take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2470676 2473512 Riggs? You Martin Riggs?
2473887 2476848 Of the Chicago Riggses.<br />What's your name?
2477349 2478683 Pieter Von-- Vor--
2478892 2480727 Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.
2481687 2484523 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
2485857 2487817 -That's you.<br />MURTAUGH: It's official.
2489111 2490403 They are official.
2491321 2493573 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2493907 2497452 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested--
2497703 2500747 Once his identity<br />has been established.
2502624 2506044 We do have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2506420 2509881 ...which I'll take up with your<br />State Department tomorrow.
2510090 2513093 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2514219 2515970 My dear officer...
2517097 2519891 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2523103 2525063 Who is the dickhead now?
2528400 2531403 This house is owned by<br />the South African government.
2531611 2533654 This is South African soil.
2533905 2535656 Now get out of here.
2536783 2537909 All of you.
2539077 2540161 Okay.
2542748 2544291 Come on, let's go.
2546752 2548086 Hey, man, don't do it.
2548295 2552795 Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,<br />and I'll make you eat this thing.
2555427 2556636 Kaffir!
2558513 2561307 RIGGS: With those credentials,<br />Chuck Manson could get off.
2561516 2563809 - Went to school with him.<br />-Yeah, right.
2565645 2568981 Miss, could you step out<br />of the car, please?
2570942 2573152 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2574905 2576323 I'm sorry. Are you...?
2578200 2579284 Don't open that.
2580452 2581995 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2582204 2585916 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2586291 2588167 Is he serious with this stuff?
2588668 2589669 Yes.
2589920 2592547 These are police officers,<br />Miss Van Den Haas.
2592964 2594298 They were just leaving.
2597010 2598845 She is a consulate secretary.
2599846 2601556 Give her back the briefcase.
2604518 2605852 Give it to her.
2608188 2610857 Here. I'm sorry,<br />Miss Consulate Secretary.
2611358 2612442 It's only papers--
2612651 2614194 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2614444 2617196 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2617364 2620075 How'd you like to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2627374 2629876 RIGGS: I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2639010 2641095 -It's the Triangle Trade again.<br />-The what?
2641346 2644057 Didn't you ever do American history<br />at school?
2644224 2646100 From molasses to rum to slaves.
2646351 2648478 Now it's drugs to dollars<br />to Krugerrands.
2648687 2652482 I know there's a dead guy<br />with a surfboard where his face was...
2652691 2656111 ...and the State Department's<br />breathing down our throats.
2656361 2660782 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African Consulate.
2661032 2662199 Apologize?
2662409 2664702 He's a sack of shit!<br />He's dirty, a crook.
2664911 2667622 It doesn't matter if he's dirty.<br />He's a diplomat.
2667873 2672127 He's got immunity. We can't<br />touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.
2672377 2674545 Is that clear?<br />Does that spell it out?
2674713 2675755 Yes, sir.
2675922 2679550 -Who the hell is this guy?<br />-Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.
2681428 2685928 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />A civilian you're supposed to protect!
2686308 2689269 -He's alive, isn't he?<br />-It's okay. I signed a waiver.
2689519 2692939 -Besides, I usually wait in the car.<br />-Usually? Usually?
2693148 2695233 They're very adamant about that.
2695442 2698611 - I don't give a fuck.<br />-They're good cops. They're the best.
2698820 2701113 One time, a guy was waving a gun--
2701323 2702615 What'd he say?
2704784 2705826 What did he say?
2706077 2708412 "I don't give a fuck."<br />It's his mantra.
2708622 2711750 Why is everybody's ass parked<br />on my desk? Up! Up!
2713126 2714544 It's a rubber plant!
2714836 2717755 I had nothing to do with it.<br />Looks like a week's supply.
2717923 2718965 Go spit.
2719132 2722301 I'm sorry, I forgot.<br />You're too old for that shit.
2724971 2727556 COP: If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2744157 2745783 Thank you, Mr. Rudd.
2751206 2753499 One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.
2757837 2760965 I hope you understood<br />what was happening here today.
2761174 2764010 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2764386 2766513 Why don't you explain it to me?
2766888 2771388 The policies of our government are not<br />popular here in America, as you know.
2771726 2775396 The police department of this city<br />is overrun with blacks.
2776022 2779108 They have badges and guns,<br />and they hate us.
2779693 2781861 Our consulate, its staff...
2782195 2786490 ...and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2793999 2795750 Good night, Mr. Rudd.
2807137 2809055 RUDD:<br />Things are getting out of hand.
2809264 2811516 We are suffering too many losses.
2811891 2814643 We have to move the cash<br />in one large shipment.
2814894 2817271 PIETER: We'll need something bigger<br />than a suitcase.
2817522 2821400 RUDD: I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2821568 2824279 Your warning did not work.
2832746 2834164 -Let's go!<br />-I'm coming.
2834372 2836540 Come on! Move!
2836791 2839084 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2839252 2842088 -Big deal. I've gotta eat too.<br />MURTAUGH: Come on, Leo.
2842881 2844465 RIGGS:<br />Give me the food.
2849679 2852723 RIGGS: Who ordered the super combo?<br />MURTAUGH: Over here.
2853224 2854934 LEO:<br />I get a steak sandwich.
2855185 2856227 RIGGS:<br />Who gets Leo?
2856561 2858312 You got a big, empty house.
2858563 2860898 I got a trailer.<br />What will I do with him?
2861107 2863400 My place is too small. You take him.
2863610 2864944 I had him last night.
2865195 2866696 Excuse me, fellas!
2867781 2869949 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2870283 2873077 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.<br />Now, come on.
2873787 2876831 -Don't eat the tuna.<br />-Where were you? I just said that!
2877290 2879625 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2879793 2881336 We're not going back. Shut up!
2881586 2884505 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back. That's it.
2884756 2887967 Can I give you two guys<br />a friendly piece of advice?
2888218 2891804 Never go up to the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2892097 2893973 You know why? Let me tell you.
2894307 2897810 They fuck you<br />at the drive-through, okay?
2898019 2902023 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2902273 2904608 They know you won't<br />turn around and go back.
2904818 2907654 They don't care.<br />Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!
2907821 2909656 I'm not eating this tuna!
2909864 2911365 Shut up!
2984230 2985731 Good morning, Mr. Rudd.
2986232 2988192 -Get rid of that man.<br />-Yes, Sir.
2990904 2994240 Sorry, you're gonna have to leave<br />the premises right now.
3003917 3005376 RIKA:<br />The morning faxes.
3042622 3046167 Sam, come here. What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3046668 3049587 Here, Sam. I want you<br />to bite Leo for me.
3057262 3059681 Leo. Leo!
3060515 3061974 What are you doing?
3062183 3064143 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3064394 3066479 I like living the way I live.
3066688 3070817 When's the last time you did<br />the refrigerator? The pan under it?
3070984 3072652 -There's a pan under there?<br />-Oh, please. Come on.
3072902 3073944 [PHONE RINGS]
3074153 3076905 Where's my phone?<br />Where the fuck is everything?
3077115 3078699 Where's my TV?
3078950 3080826 Everything is outside.
3081035 3082619 Just stop what you're doing.
3082912 3086040 -Get the dog out of here!<br />-You go before the mutt.
3086291 3088001 Out, out! Oh, man!
3091921 3092963 Hello.
3093172 3094840 WOMAN:<br />Riggs, it's Collins.
3095216 3098552 -Has Murtaugh checked in with you?<br />-No, he hasn't. Why?
3098803 3102014 I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
3103057 3104183 I'll be right there.
3110023 3111441 Stay in the car.
3111649 3112691 Get in there.
3115945 3117321 Roger!
3119115 3120366 MURTAUGH:<br />I'm upstairs!
3120825 3123035 Should I call 999,<br />"Officer in distress"?
3124329 3125496 I'll cover the back!
3125705 3128165 -Where are you?<br />MURTAUGH: I'm up here.
3142013 3143222 Rog?
3144057 3145933 -Rog?<br />-In here.
3160865 3161907 Good morning.
3168706 3172501 First time in 20 years<br />I got the bathroom all to myself.
3172710 3176255 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3176506 3180009 Just me and my new<br />Salt Water Sportsman magazine.
3189268 3192604 Is that the one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3195274 3196733 Yeah.
3201447 3205701 Sitting here reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3206536 3211036 ...when I glanced over,<br />I saw this.
3213418 3215044 Oh, Jesus!
3216129 3217130 Is that all?
3217380 3221050 -You scared the shit out of me.<br />-Scared the shit out of you?
3222468 3223969 How long you been here?
3224137 3225888 I've been here all night.
3226222 3229058 My legs are so goddamn numb,<br />I don't know if I can--
3229308 3230600 Don't move.
3230893 3232060 I can't.
3232311 3235022 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3236107 3238901 A dirty job,<br />but somebody's gotta do it.
3244991 3246450 Okay, okay, okay.
3253249 3255459 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3256043 3257335 He's fucked.
3259464 3261841 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3263259 3265427 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3265636 3266845 That's a relief.
3267180 3269473 -I'll have to get help.<br />-No way!
3270057 3271475 Why?
3273311 3275563 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3276022 3279859 This is serious.<br />I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.
3280067 3281151 Bomb Squad?
3287033 3289076 Okay, call them in.
3290203 3291829 -Martin?<br />-Yeah?
3292038 3294957 Call them, but don't use<br />the open frequency.
3296501 3297710 Riggs!
3300129 3302172 Let's keep this quiet, okay?
3303049 3304633 Sure. Trust me.
3321859 3323110 Excuse me, please.
3323319 3325404 WOODS:<br />Officer, an escort isn't necessary.
3325655 3329408 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3329659 3333037 I have helped policemen through<br />the most traumatic moments.
3333246 3336916 Believe me, there is nothing<br />in this room that I cannot handle.
3339919 3341420 I was wrong.
3341754 3343255 Excuse me.
3345424 3346675 Riggs.
3346884 3349928 I should've known.<br />Where there's one, there's the other.
3355977 3357728 Split.
3358271 3360731 You're the psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3361107 3363150 It's ready to come out.
3363776 3367321 Hey! Hey!<br />I gotta live in this house!
3369532 3370616 Clear this room.
3372493 3374036 Come on, Riggs.
3377957 3379792 -You too, Riggs.<br />-No.
3381335 3383253 Riggs. Out.
3390553 3392012 All right.
3392346 3393847 Sergeant.
3394348 3395640 Dive into the tub.
3396517 3399478 When you do, pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3399896 3403774 This is a good cast-iron tub.<br />It'll withstand a hell of a blast.
3404150 3405276 I can't do it.
3405484 3408528 He can't do it.<br />He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.
3408779 3410655 He can't even walk.
3410823 3412658 I'll have to help him.
3413659 3415494 All right, you better wear this.
3416787 3418789 -How's the nitrogen?<br />-Almost there.
3422501 3426171 What he's doing is spraying<br />this thing with liquid nitrogen...
3426339 3429175 ...to give you a second<br />or two before detonation.
3429342 3432053 -Got that?<br />-A second or two. Thanks a lot.
3432678 3433720 Lights out!
3433930 3435514 Get him up and out.
3439310 3440936 -Let's go.<br />-Move!
3443898 3445190 -Good luck.<br />-Baker.
3446025 3447359 You got a piece?
3447568 3449403 -A Smith & Wesson.<br />-Try this.
3449612 3451864 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3453741 3455242 Good luck.
3458746 3460205 All right, let's move.
3466629 3467963 Well...
3469548 3471132 Alone at last.
3472259 3475428 Why didn't they plant<br />the bomb in Trish's stove?
3475638 3479058 Think of all the needless suffering<br />that could have ended.
3492363 3494490 I'm gonna die on the toilet.
3494740 3497242 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3497410 3500413 Anyway, I'm here, and I don't<br />plan on going just now.
3502748 3504082 Let's do it.
3510756 3511798 On "three."
3512008 3514427 Wait, let me get into the tub.
3514885 3516887 I'm just gonna give you the--
3517430 3519640 On "three," huh? What do you say?
3522143 3523310 One...
3524311 3526313 -...two--<br />-Wait!
3528482 3531109 Do we do it on "three"...
3531610 3533486 ...or "one, two, three"...
3533696 3536115 -...then do it?<br />-Well, it's your ass.
3536282 3537408 It's up to you.
3538701 3540035 My ass, yeah.
3540453 3541495 "Three."
3541829 3543288 We go on "three"?
3543497 3545957 "One, two" and then "three"!
3549462 3550504 One...
3550838 3552214 -Martin?<br />-What?
3559055 3560181 I know.
3561348 3562974 I mean it, man.
3565936 3567228 I hear you.
3569982 3572317 We're not gonna fucking die,<br />all right?
3573486 3574653 On "three."
3575654 3576863 One...
3577698 3578740 ...two...
3579158 3580325 ...three!
3589835 3591378 LEO:<br />I gotta go! I gotta go!
3609605 3612899 Get off me. I don't want<br />anybody to see us like this.
3616904 3618238 Mr. Jones?
3619198 3621074 Sit down, please.
3623786 3625871 What can I do for you today?
3626038 3628874 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3629083 3631710 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3631919 3634212 Of course, I can help him do that.
3634421 3636881 I want you to talk him out of it.
3637633 3638800 Talk him out of it?
3639135 3640594 Whatever for?
3641095 3645099 This is a bad time for him to go.<br />I mean, with all the trouble.
3645307 3648268 Ask your friend to come back<br />later in the week...
3648519 3650646 -...we can sit down--<br />-No, he's here.
3650896 3652230 -He's here?<br />-He's here now.
3652398 3653399 Alphonse!
3653566 3654733 Alphonse?
3662158 3663450 How you doing?
3663659 3665577 There must be some mistake.

5244989 5247241 But you weren't driving, were you?
5248200 5250911 You can't imagine the surprise.
5251120 5255620 I pulled back this matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5257668 5258960 Your wife, right?
5261338 5263423 She didn't die straight away.
5265176 5266969 It took a bit of time.
5273976 5276186 Don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5430132 5431633 [PHONE RINGS]
5433844 5436429 -Murtaugh.<br />RIGGS: She's dead. They killed her.
5436639 5437931 Where are you?
5438140 5440600 They killed her. She's dead.
5440809 5442352 They killed them both.
5442519 5446189 Slow down. Who are you<br />talking about? Where are you?
5446398 5448650 She's dead, Roger. She's dead.
5450361 5454114 Just calm down. We'll take<br />care of it. Where are you?
5454698 5458284 I'm not a cop tonight.<br />It's personal. I'm not a cop.
5458535 5461538 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5462539 5467039 I'm gonna get those bastards<br />and fuck them! I'm going there now.
5467419 5471881 We're not going to the fucking<br />stilt house. We're under orders!
5472049 5474342 Then the stilt house will come to me.
5474551 5477053 You don't understand.<br />They killed them both.
5477221 5479723 -They got Rika and my wife.<br />-Don't hang up!
5480307 5482726 Riggs. Riggs!
5485729 5487063 Shit.
5500452 5501578 What's the deal?
5502579 5505540 You talk to the feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5505749 5506833 That's not fair.
5510879 5512505 We trusted you, Leo.
5514508 5515675 You betrayed us.
5517553 5518679 You took our money!
5522599 5526019 We want it back now,<br />you slimy little shit.
5528105 5530440 Give him some more.<br />He seems to like it.
5564308 5566435 Don't try and stop me.
5566643 5569145 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5570064 5572816 They declared war on the police.
5573567 5575151 You know about that?
5575402 5577654 I heard it on the radio.
5578405 5580407 We don't have the authority.
5580657 5581908 Cavanaugh...
5582117 5584119 ...\Wyler, Shapiro...
5585662 5589666 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5591502 5593003 You got a plan?
5597424 5600051 If you drive around<br />the front of the house...
5600260 5602345 ...you wait for my signal...
5603097 5605849 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5606100 5607142 They got Leo.
5609603 5610854 Be careful.
5618070 5619196 Wait.
5619696 5620697 What's your signal?
5622157 5624200 You'll know it when it happens.
5626954 5629456 Somehow I think I will know.
5662114 5663406 Payday.
5677254 5679005 Feel like talking, Leo?
5684178 5685345 It's the big one!
5689933 5691017 All right. Cool it.
5691226 5693645 -Watch him.<br />LEO: Move me away from the windows!
5718253 5719629 Leo.
5727054 5728096 LEO:<br />Watch the glass!
5728263 5729305 -Come on!<br />-I'll go.
5764800 5767093 Riggs, you crazy mother--
5783694 5785529 Holy Christ!
5789658 5790825 You all right?
5791034 5792118 I'm okay.
5792327 5793369 Thanks.
5794496 5796664 -Was Adolf in there?<br />-He got away.
5797624 5799542 -I'm gonna find him.<br />-What about Leo?
5799793 5800877 What about Leo?
5801128 5803046 You're on your own now, Leo.
5803297 5804756 What do you mean?
5804965 5808385 Take my car to the station<br />and wait for the federal marshal.
5808635 5810887 It's been an experience knowing you.
5815225 5818228 - I don't want a hug.<br />-Give the little fellow a hug.
5818478 5820313 I had a lot of fun.
5820897 5822648 You do your duty now.
5822858 5825151 Don't worry.<br />I'll really get them now.
5825360 5827779 -Listen! Wait!<br />-You know how to find him.
5827988 5830073 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5831575 5833868 -Yeah.<br />-Loud as you want.
5834077 5835161 Really?
5835370 5837663 -Okay. Really?<br />-Bye, Leo.
5842419 5843753 MURTAUGH:<br />Check it out.
5844087 5847590 The Alba Varden is<br />a cargo ship, not a woman.
5847799 5851302 The Port Authority said that<br />The Alba Varden arrived today...
5851511 5854388 ...and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.
5856433 5858393 This is the 11th dock.
5858602 5861605 It must be here some place.<br />I know I'm right.
5866860 5867861 The ship.
5868028 5869446 What did I tell you?
5871281 5874033 That container there,<br />with three heavy hitters.
5874242 5875368 Let's have a look.
5877204 5879539 I'll take two of them out.<br />You take one.
5881249 5885211 Better yet, you take two,<br />I'll take one. Pull over.
5931174 5932466 -Riggs?<br />-Yeah?
5932676 5933802 I can't see shit.
5934010 5935886 Me either. What is this shit?
5936096 5937639 Got a light?
5939182 5941350 It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.
5941518 5943770 I still can't see shit.
5945605 5948941 -You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5954030 5956532 Holy shit. Fort Knox!
5959828 5961830 Hell, how much is it?
5963498 5964999 Thousands.
5966543 5968503 Fucking millions!
5968837 5971548 Billions!<br />A fucking Donald Trump lotto!
5981725 5982726 Look at this.
5983477 5985729 These are thousand-dollar bills.
5987481 5991651 With what I'm holding, I could put<br />all three of my kids through college.
5992986 5994028 Take it.
6001578 6003079 Fucking drug money.
6003330 6004998 Do something good with it.
6005207 6007918 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
6020472 6022265 Load the container.
6022516 6026186 Next time the sun hits their bodies,<br />they'll be in Cape Town.
6030232 6033068 -This thing's moving.<br />-It sure as hell is.
6033276 6036028 -What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
6036571 6038030 Let's shoot our way out.
6038240 6040242 Don't do that. I got a better idea.
6094838 6096339 Our money.
6099342 6101677 Just make sure they're dead.
6112439 6116109 -You go first. I'm too old.<br />-No, you go first. I'll cover you.
6131374 6133667 -How do we get out?<br />-I'm going this way.
6133877 6136129 I'll go this way.<br />I'll check over here.

6470338 6473341 You're breathing. You're alive.<br />You're not dead.
6473716 6475217 No, don't die.
6476552 6479221 You're not dead until I tell you.

6523099 6524517 I thought you were dying.
6525018 6528229 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not dying in your arms.
6528438 6530022 You son of a bitch.
6535069 6538489 Are they all gone? The bad guys?<br />Did you get them?
