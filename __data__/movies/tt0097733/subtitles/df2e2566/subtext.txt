28165 30845 God! I love this job! Man!<br />Can't you go any faster?
31085 32085 Floor this thing!
32285 34645 It's my wife's. I won't go faster.
34845 36125 You're doing 65 now.
36325 37845 65?! Shit!
38125 40845 Get your foot off the pedal!<br />You're killing my corn!
43525 48446 We're eastbound on 4th, in pursuit of<br />a red BMW, driver Caucasian, blonde.
48806 51206 Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.
53046 56366 You are westbound on 2nd.<br />20 William 12 is southbound.
56686 59966 You're heading straight<br />toward each other.
60206 62366 - Somebody back off.<br />- Got it.
62646 65046 - What'd she say?<br />- We're about to have an accident.
84206 88207 Go! We'll stick with the red bastard.<br />You chase the blue.
88487 92167 That's confirmed.<br />You got red, we'll get blue.
92407 96487 - What's the pursuit?<br />- 20 William 15 and 20 William 12.
97087 99047 - That's Riggs, Murtaugh.<br />- And their squad.
99247 101727 - $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.<br />- Who's driving?
101927 103527 Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.
103727 106727 I knew nothing about the wagon.<br />Bet's off.
107007 108167 Shut up!
117527 118887 What the hell is that?
119087 121527 What fuckin' language is that?
121768 123008 It's German.
123248 124368 Japanese?
124608 127608 It's a Japanese radio.<br />Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.
127888 128928 They own everything.
134728 136128 Shotgun!
144968 146728 Shots are being fired.
147288 148968 Thanks for the scoop.
149288 151768 The bastard shot my wife's windshield.
152128 153448 Entering the pursuit.
166809 169609 Oh, shit, man! We're splitting up!
173929 176249 Son-of-a-bitch! Now we're cooking.
180289 181249 Step on it!
194329 195449 Look out!
202530 203690 See you!
224810 227730 I'd like to see your license<br />and proof of insurance!
243371 245891 We got one. Yours is going up the hill.
246091 247411 So is Riggs, on foot!
251251 254211 Hey, Riggs! Get your slow ass in here!
254571 256211 Get in here, now!
256571 257691 Only if I drive.
257891 259531 Move over. I'll drive.
259731 262091 No, go around. I'm driving.
262331 264331 I'll drive.
265411 267411 Did you get a make on that red Beemer?
268171 269691 Not one scratch, you hear?
274852 276492 - You won't make it.<br />- I will.
276692 277892 There's not enough room!
278212 279852 You're not going to make it!
280932 282932 Look at my side panel!
293372 295772 Goddamn it, you were right.
296292 298212 There wasn't enough room.
360934 362294 He's turning right!
371614 372934 Get out of the way!
388295 389855 This was a new car, Riggs.
390295 391455 Well, it still is.
398975 400135 On three.
400815 401895 One...
402535 404375 ...two... three!
405895 407215 Shit!
408815 410735 You forgot to turn your indicator on.
410975 413615 Where the hell is he?<br />This guy's Mandrake!
413815 416735 Where were you, man?!<br />Goddamnit!
417015 418455 Me?! Where did he go?!
418655 421336 - He's fucking gone!<br />- I can see that!
421576 424536 - You're supposed to come on "three".<br />- I thought you meant, "three" then go!
424736 426536 No! We always go on "three"!
426736 429736 Sometimes we go, "one, two, three,"<br />then go!
431056 432336 Go check back there!
432576 436576 If you see anybody running out,<br />just pump the shit out of them.
437536 438936 What was that?
440856 443336 - He crawled into the trunk.<br />- I got you covered.
449936 451576 Holy Christ!
452216 453696 That's a lot of money.
460217 461857 It's gold!
462457 463617 Gold!
463897 465017 Krugerrands.
465217 468057 It's illegal. You can't import them<br />into the country.
468377 469497 You're right.
469737 473297 The damage you caused is coming<br />out of the department's budget.
473577 477537 - Pay it in Krugerrands.<br />- Don't make jokes, make arrests.
477817 479737 I want an explanation.
480017 483737 - Things got out of hand.<br />- You said this was a routine bust.
484017 488897 You didn't mention helicopters,<br />automatic weapons, Krugerrands...
489257 491217 This was bigger than we thought.
491737 493057 Talk to you later.
499578 502578 I worked psycho ward.<br />You'll never get out.
503938 506258 One minute, fifteen seconds.
506578 508418 Shapiro, scratch my nose.
509778 514378 Hey! What's going on? Is this<br />kindergarten or a police station?
514858 516258 Get some work done.
516938 519578 Houdini Jr. Bets he can free himself<br />in 5 minutes.
519858 520858 I will too.
526098 528178 Don't try this at home, kids.
538139 542579 It's over now. Put your money<br />on the desk and get back to work.
544899 546299 Suckers.
552539 554739 How the hell did you do that?
556299 560099 I dislocated my shoulder once.<br />Now I can do it whenever I want.
560299 561739 Doesn't it hurt?
562099 563979 Yeah, it does.
564739 567659 But not as much as...<br />when I put it back in.
578940 580860 If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.
581340 583500 My door is always open, Sergeant.
584780 588340 We should keep this<br />on a professional level.
589500 592340 Why the hell do you<br />do this to yourself?
592620 595500 Who else could I do it to?<br />None of them will let me.
595780 597260 And I need the money.
597460 598340 Cough up!
601020 603860 It's not all here yet. I want it all.
611021 612981 Where did this come from?
613701 618541 You can't help yourself to this stuff!<br />It's evidence. It's a Krugerrand.
619021 621461 - It's mine. I won it.<br />- It's not yours.
621821 623821 You want to get busted?
625541 627541 Want to get something to eat?
627821 629301 Not tonight.
629661 631981 - Rianne's commercial is on.<br />- She's in a commercial?
632221 633861 Not so loud!
634061 636901 What's wrong?<br />I'd be proud if I was you.
637741 640901 I haven't seen it yet.<br />What if she stinks?
641181 643661 You got to be kidding. She'll be great.
643981 644982 Listen up!
646182 648222 Tonight at... what time?
648582 649422 Come on!
649742 651062 What time?
651902 652782 Eight.
653062 654662 Eight o'clock, on... channel?
657182 661342 Eight. The Sergeant's daughter, Rianne.<br />Here's a picture of her.
663022 666182 She's going to make<br />her television debut in a commercial.
672702 675542 With this crowd, baby,<br />you'd better not stink.
690783 694263 What happened? This is a new car.<br />Mom's going to be upset!
694543 697223 - It's still new.<br />- No, it's not, it's wrecked.
697463 699903 I don't want your mother to know.
701063 702903 Do your homework too.
703143 706023 - Hey! I haven't read these.<br />- Rianne put them there.
706223 708463 Why don't you look out for me?
708743 712823 Hey, Ricky! I want to use my driveway<br />once in a while.
713423 715263 Nice oxygen tent.
715463 718903 - Do I look like Michael Jackson?<br />- No, but you're bad.
719263 723464 This is a two-car garage,<br />and this is my hobby room upstairs.
723744 728224 I retire when I'm 52, the whole<br />nine yards kick in when I'm 55.
728504 730304 You're not retiring, are you?
730584 733424 - I've thought of it, since I met you.<br />- Thank you.
733744 737184 This is a nice hobby room.<br />All you need now is a hobby.
740344 741104 Jesus!
741584 742944 What's wrong with you?
743824 745704 I'm sorry. That's very uncool.
745944 748184 You're sorry? Check my shorts!
748944 751424 - Don't you use hammers anymore?<br />- What's a hammer?
753264 756784 Easy. It's no Saturday Night Special,<br />for crying out loud.
758625 760105 Give it back.
762225 764265 A man's not even safe in his own home.
764545 766105 Then stay the hell out of here.
766945 768625 You got any traffic warrants?
768905 770105 Can you fix them?
777305 779625 Almost time. Are we taping this?
779905 782825 Yes, so we can watch it<br />over and over again.
783065 784425 Take the stairs.
784625 787785 Nick, get your feet off the table.<br />You too, Martin.
787985 790985 - The color's no good.<br />- It's fine. You'll mess it up.
791265 792705 I want you to look good.
792905 793785 Unplug it.
793825 795066 That's your sister!
795506 796706 Picture's perfect.
796906 797906 Yeah?
799186 800106 Do I know you?
800746 801786 Yes, sir.
801986 804506 We had a long talk about a week ago.
804746 805826 About what?
806106 807666 Your new hobby room.
807946 809586 This is George.
812506 814426 Did you sense that I liked you?
815626 816786 Yes, sir.
817666 819426 Sit down and be quiet.
822786 825946 - What are you eating?<br />- My tuna fish sandwich.
826186 827106 Tuna?
827706 829506 You can't eat tuna!
829946 831426 Dad killed Flipper.
831626 833267 We're boycotting tuna...
833547 837507 ...because they kill the dolphins<br />that get caught in the nets.
838147 839227 Have ham.
839467 840747 Eat Miss Piggy.
841867 844187 - I'm sorry!<br />- It's only my eye.
849147 851147 Oh, my God! It's coming on!
853987 855227 My baby!
856307 858827 Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?
867707 869348 When the time has come...
870068 872068 ...and the moment is right...
873068 874228 ...remember...
874748 877068 ...use Ramses' Extra condoms.
878628 880428 - We do!<br />- Ramses' Extra.
881188 884428 Because caring means<br />all the protection you can get.
893748 895228 Take the kids upstairs.
896148 897908 We learn this in Human Development.
898188 900828 In Human what?!<br />Human Development what?!
901028 902508 Chill out, Daddy.
902748 904108 Upstairs!
904348 905868 Nick, upstairs.
906388 908549 You know how your father is.
908789 911349 - I looked fat.<br />- I liked you.
913629 914989 Home. Out!
915789 916829 I got a gun.
922269 924629 What? She looked beautiful.
924869 928229 I liked it. She made me want to buy<br />rubbers right now.
935389 938549 I thought it was great.<br />Rianne, that was...
939469 941789 - I thought you were terrific.<br />- Really?
942069 944310 I think she's got a hell of a future.
945070 946910 George is afraid. He's going home.
947150 948350 Stick around.
948750 950150 He has a gun.
950430 953590 It's an old gun<br />and he's not a very good shot.
954430 956990 That's good. I'm going anyway.<br />Good night.
957270 959870 - I'll buy you a beer.<br />- You let him buy it.
960110 963070 You're under 21. Be back by midnight.
964310 966670 Wait and see. Cops never let up.
966950 970910 I'll have rubbers on my desk,<br />rubbers in the mail, in the coffee...
971150 975590 If you'd only kept your mouth shut!<br />I'm going for a walk.
975830 978830 Give the boys some credit.<br />In one ear, out the rubber.
991831 994151 How goes it with you, Hans?
994351 996511 Okay. You, Pieter?
997511 1000471 That's quite enough of that.<br />Come on over here, Hans.
1002511 1005511 Mind the plastic.<br />I'm having painting done.
1006831 1008591 The important thing is...
1008831 1009831 ...are you okay?
1010191 1011991 No bones broken?
1012511 1013831 I'm fine, thanks.
1014591 1016031 Just bumps and bruises, eh?
1016671 1018031 Yeah, that's all.
1018271 1019632 Good, good.
1023192 1026152 However, we lost over $1 million<br />in Krugerrand.
1027512 1030672 I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.
1031312 1032512 It happens.
1032872 1034712 It's not your fault.
1035032 1038032 Sometimes things do not go as planned.
1038872 1042312 As you say, they just happen,<br />Eh, Pieter?
1050472 1053632 You give a whole new meaning<br />to the word, "drop cloth. "
1055312 1058633 Certain policemen have become<br />an intolerable nuisance.
1059233 1063713 They are obviously on to us again.<br />How do you propose to handle it?
1064073 1065393 Warn them off.
1067233 1068913 It's my experience...
1069353 1072673 ...that a scared cop<br />is more useful than a dead one.
1072913 1074073 A warning?
1074673 1076393 Is that not a bit tame?
1076833 1078233 Depends on how you do it.
1080233 1082153 Then you better look at this.
1088593 1091913 This is the policeman in charge.
1094514 1095714 A Kaffir.
1097434 1098594 Lovely.
1099754 1101394 Remember to take these in order.
1102274 1105114 There's a packet<br />for each day of the week.
1107034 1108434 This yours?
1109114 1110794 I found it in the wash.
1117394 1118954 I keep losing this.
1120114 1121354 Something's wrong.
1121714 1125114 No, not really.<br />It's just a goddamn pen.
1128074 1129434 What about the pen?
1129954 1131795 It reminds me of something.
1132795 1134035 Of what?
1134635 1136315 It reminds me of...
1136635 1138475 ...the night Vicki was killed.
1139635 1141075 I didn't mean to push.
1142475 1145275 That's okay.<br />We never really talked about this.
1150315 1154795 I was to meet her for dinner.<br />One of those romantic dinners for two.
1155075 1156275 I had so much work.
1158755 1160555 And I forgot about it.
1162155 1166315 She waited at the restaurant<br />for an hour before she drove home.
1168116 1172276 It was midnight when I got home<br />to a ringing phone. I answered it.
1172516 1174996 They said she was killed in a car crash.
1180516 1183516 If I'd been driving,<br />we'd have been all right.
1186196 1190196 I remember falling down<br />on my knees and shaking all over.
1190516 1193196 I remember thinking, "I'm losing it. "
1194356 1196716 There I was lying on the floor...
1198196 1202236 ...and I'm seeing under the couch,<br />and I see this gold pen.
1203636 1208357 Just lying there. I'd been looking<br />for it for two months. There it is.
1210197 1212197 She wasn't a great housekeeper.
1213877 1217597 This voice goes off in my head,<br />like a drill instructor.
1218557 1220877 It said, "Get up! Now!"
1222397 1226717 I didn't feel like it, but I got up.<br />Muscles were still working.
1227237 1229677 Then I drove to the hospital...
1229997 1233157 ...identified her, signed her out<br />with my gold pen.
1233397 1235717 Trish found a gold pen in the laundry.
1245918 1248078 Look around you, Sam.
1249758 1251238 One day, Sam...
1252278 1253918 ...this'll all be yours.
1257518 1260598 Find a nice bitch,<br />raise a couple of pups.
1261438 1263758 A man could be happy here.
1267958 1271918 Anybody tell you if you sit on<br />cold rocks too long, you get piles?
1272198 1273798 Let's go watch TV.
1362961 1364201 Kaffirs!
1367721 1369281 Wondering about your kids?
1370361 1372521 About what we've done to them?
1373481 1376001 If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.
1377161 1379321 I'd be going fucking bananas.
1380401 1382041 Want to know what we've done?
1382641 1383521 Shall I tell you?
1385561 1388281 Just let your imagination run wild.
1389001 1390921 This has just been a warning.
1391241 1394882 After this, it gets bloody.<br />Tell your people to back off.
1395242 1397002 Don't be a smart Kaffir.
1397562 1399242 Maybe we let you live, huh?
1420082 1423082 - You didn't see a face?<br />- Not one. They had on hoods.
1423442 1424722 What about a voice?
1424922 1429442 That crazy motherfucker who did talk<br />had a strange accent.
1429763 1434443 Not German, not English.<br />Kind of guttural. Really shitty accent.
1434723 1438043 Wait. Anything like what we chased<br />the other night?
1438443 1440763 Yeah, kind of like that.
1441123 1442603 Trish and the kids?
1442803 1445723 They're at her sister's house<br />in Bellflower.
1445963 1450123 Listen up! You heard what happened<br />to Rog last night?
1450643 1452603 Forensics get back with anything?
1452883 1454883 Not yet. They'll keep us posted.
1455243 1458563 We got to watch each other's<br />backs and fronts.
1458803 1462643 You can all watch my back<br />in poker tomorrow. You in?
1462923 1465723 - If we catch these assholes.<br />- Count me in.
1471484 1473964 I got something special for you.
1474324 1477324 Leo Getz has been placed<br />in protective custody.
1477604 1481244 You guys are going to baby-sit<br />until Washington sends the Feds.
1481604 1484804 - How long?<br />- Until the red tape is processed.
1484884 1486244 Couple, three days.
1486484 1490644 Getz is going to testify<br />before a commission of inquiry.
1490924 1492924 Drugs, laundered money, etc.
1493484 1494404 I'll be there in 10 minutes.
1497004 1498684 This is not a shit assignment.
1499004 1500844 - Yes, it is.<br />- No, it isn't.
1501284 1502004 It isn't.
1502324 1503204 It is.
1503524 1505365 Shut up, both of you.
1506445 1508125 I've guaranteed his safety.
1508365 1509204 Why us?
1509205 1512365 You two are the most qualified. And...
1512645 1515605 ...after last night,<br />you could use the break.
1515845 1517125 I can handle last night.
1518285 1519645 What do we do with him?
1519845 1521365 Take him to Disneyland.
1522205 1524125 This stinks. This stinks.
1524365 1528845 I don't give a fuck! I don't have an<br />ulcer because I know when to say that.
1529125 1530645 Here's where he's staying.
1530885 1535165 A nice hotel. The Justice Department<br />is paying. Enjoy yourselves.
1536285 1537645 One more thing.
1540565 1541685 Know what that says?
1542046 1544726 Yeah. Same thing as that,<br />but I don't give a fuck.
1548726 1551406 You're lucky.<br />I have to live with that.
1562726 1564286 What room is that for?
1564646 1565486 612.
1568166 1570126 This is it. 612.
1573486 1574766 Police.
1575006 1576126 How do I know that?
1576606 1580007 After I shoot you, you can<br />examine the bullet. Open up.
1581927 1584087 Don't you want to see a badge?
1584327 1585807 - Where's your badge?<br />- Shut up.
1586007 1588327 I get it. Bad cop, good cop.
1588607 1589927 Shut up.
1591167 1593607 Bad cop, bad cop.<br />I know the routines.
1593847 1596767 - Are you Leo Getz?<br />- That's me, Leo Getz.
1597007 1600487 Whatever you need, Leo gets. Get it?
1601007 1603847 I use that to break the ice<br />when I meet people.
1604127 1606247 I'm Sgt. Murtaugh, this is Sgt. Riggs.
1606447 1609367 Nice to meet you.<br />So what do I call you guys?
1609607 1610927 Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
1611127 1612967 We're going to be your shadow.
1615127 1617128 That's fine. Hey, an old-fashioned...
1618648 1621688 Okay. I just ain't seen one<br />in a long time.
1621968 1624288 I didn't think anyone used them anymore.
1624888 1628048 I bet the kid's got an automatic.<br />Have you?
1628328 1629368 Yep, a Beretta.
1631728 1633168 You sure you guys are cops?
1634168 1637008 Better watch how you treat me.<br />I'm a state witness.
1637248 1638528 Star witness.
1639568 1641128 We'll take that room.
1642048 1644488 I already have my stuff in this room.
1652248 1656409 It's yours, okay?<br />I'll move it in the small room.
1656729 1660089 I'm the smallest guy here.<br />I'll take the small room.
1660409 1664569 Hey, loosen up, guys!<br />We're going to be together a long time.
1665489 1666249 I'll get it.
1667769 1669329 It's only room service.
1670089 1672929 You hungry? I'll call<br />for anything you want.
1673209 1675009 See this silk robe? Free.
1675689 1677409 - It's not free.<br />- Yes, it is.
1677689 1680689 - It's taxpayers' money.<br />- Same thing.
1684449 1685769 Morning, gentlemen.
1689769 1693450 That's my food. You guys<br />didn't want anything. Bring it here.
1694290 1695450 It's mine.
1696290 1698050 You could have had something.
1699290 1701050 I ordered eggs, not hamburger.
1707210 1708690 Not the window!
1711610 1712610 Shit!
1738331 1739811 Where is that son-of-a-bitch?
1741611 1744371 Somebody stop that guy! Stop him!
1746171 1749011 Don't leave me! I can't swim!
1755171 1759771 We're near the edge of the pool.<br />Now get the fuck off my back!
1760171 1762491 Clear! Get back! Police!
1763851 1764811 You okay?
1765011 1767692 Where were you?<br />Why didn't you follow me?
1767972 1770212 - Yeah, why didn't you?<br />- I was 7 floors up!
1772132 1773532 - He hit me.<br />- Good!
1776012 1780972 This guy took a big chance to pop all of<br />us. What'd you witness, a murder?
1781212 1783252 Nothing like that. Honest.
1785852 1790292 All I did was launder a half a billion<br />dollars in drug money.
1791372 1793372 Half a billion dollars?!
1793692 1797212 More or less.<br />Who can count that much money?
1797532 1800932 Could I have some cotton balls<br />for my nose?
1801372 1803052 Could you shut the fuck up?
1803733 1805373 You're supposed to take care of me.
1805733 1806573 Shut up!
1807893 1811373 Mr. Getz got away.<br />Our best opportunity and he gets away.
1811733 1816213 He slips through our fingers<br />and into the hands of the police.
1817053 1818333 What are you doing?
1819253 1822573 Checking to see<br />if I was standing on plastic.
1823413 1825053 Okay, I got it.
1825893 1829253 I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.<br />I work in a bank.
1829573 1832213 You have money to launder.<br />What do you do?
1832413 1833733 Bring it to you.
1835173 1838093 - He does.<br />- I don't understand. Why me?
1838373 1839693 Who am I?
1841694 1844094 You're a courier. You work for him.
1844374 1845694 I'm the drug dealer.
1849254 1852854 Don't you have plates? What is this?
1855014 1859534 I deposit the cash into the account<br />of a dummy finance company.
1860774 1862214 I issue you a cashier's check...
1862774 1866614 ...in his name,<br />minus a small commission for myself.
1867374 1868574 - The other end.<br />- You like breathing?
1868774 1869774 How much?
1870054 1871094 2%.
1871774 1874294 Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.
1876814 1879975 You return it to me as collateral<br />on a loan I make to you.
1880295 1883775 But you don't pay back the loan.<br />You keep the money.
1884055 1885055 How's that work?
1885415 1887815 That's it! Don't you get it?
1888135 1891975 It's your money. You don't pay it back.<br />And it's clean.
1892295 1894495 It is now laundered.
1895975 1897815 You cops aren't too bright.
1899975 1902135 This is the best part.
1902815 1905655 You take a tax deduction...
1906255 1909575 ...on interest payments<br />you don't even make.
1911095 1913335 - Am I a genius?<br />- You're a swindler.
1913615 1914575 Cheat.
1915015 1916216 Come on!
1916856 1920816 Everyone cheats. Look at the Pentagon.<br />So you got it?
1922856 1925776 So how come you turned yourself in,<br />Mr. Big Shot?
1926336 1928576 I was scamming those guys for months.
1929016 1931016 Every transaction, I kept a little.
1931296 1932096 You?
1932696 1934856 It was easy. Cash deposits...
1935136 1938456 ...millions of dollars in small bills<br />changing hands.
1938696 1941736 Who's going to miss $10,000 here,<br />$20,000 there?
1942616 1943336 Drug dealers.
1944696 1946376 That's right. They did.
1946696 1949296 That's why I'm living<br />out of a suitcase now.
1951856 1953457 You can give that to Nick.
1954217 1957217 But it's softer.<br />I put a fabric softener in there.
1957497 1958497 It's small, Leroy.
1958697 1962897 It's Leo, not Leroy.<br />I'll buy you another shirt.
1963137 1965897 Just give me the names<br />of those drug dealers.
1966137 1967817 I don't know any.
1968057 1970057 I just dealt with the couriers.
1970337 1972177 Where does Trish keep my laundry?
1972377 1974217 Behind the machine.
1975737 1978057 You never met anyone except couriers?
1979577 1981177 No names.
1984417 1988897 Wait a minute, come to think of it!<br />Okay, listen.
1989257 1992738 They took me up in the hills<br />to a house on stilts.
1993258 1996258 And I had a job interview with a guy...
1996538 1998498 ...and his name was...
1999418 2000898 Haynes! Hans!
2001178 2003418 - Take us there.<br />- We have to sit on this guy.
2003778 2005578 It won't hurt to look.
2005938 2006858 I know the address.
2007058 2007818 Let's go.
2008098 2009098 We shouldn't do this!
2009538 2011418 Come on, don't be a killjoy!
2011778 2014258 We're back! You're black, I'm mad.
2014458 2016098 This is going to be great!
2016458 2019258 If we're going, shouldn't I have a gun?
2021938 2024258 Is my nose still bleeding?<br />It's really sore.
2024538 2026218 Sorry about that.
2030819 2032659 It should be coming up soon.
2033059 2035379 - 9856.<br />- That's it.
2035659 2039059 - That's another possibility.<br />- This is the ninth possibility, Leo.
2039339 2042379 That's it. Nine.<br />My lucky number. Nine.
2042659 2044659 Stay in the car.
2046019 2047819 - Can't I come?<br />- Stay.
2050019 2051339 Nice car.
2051899 2053739 - What are you doing?<br />- Hooking it up.
2054019 2056019 You're not being careful!
2056299 2058739 I know what I'm doing. It's a car...
2058899 2060259 ...not a baby carriage.
2060499 2062739 You're chipping the paint.
2063859 2066700 - You smell what I smell?<br />- I smell it.
2066940 2068340 A rat?
2068940 2070740 A real stinky one.
2074380 2075580 Where you going?
2075860 2080100 I'm a peeping Tom. It goes<br />with the badge. It's fun sometimes.
2082380 2083460 Bingo!
2087300 2088940 Lars, look!
2089220 2090260 What the fuck?!
2095740 2096980 Where's the pool?
2097220 2098200 No pool.
2098300 2101380 - Of course there is.<br />- This house is built on stilts.
2101580 2103741 I'm sure there's a pool.
2115461 2116861 Cuff yourselves.
2144662 2146022 Move that truck!
2147622 2148782 Your keys!
2151142 2152342 You all right?
2153182 2154262 Where you going?
2154462 2155942 That was the waiter from the hotel.
2156102 2157182 Wait for me!
2157502 2158942 Get the fuck out of here!
2159182 2161862 What are you doing?!<br />You can't take my truck!
2176382 2178823 Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!
2178983 2180303 Where did he go?
2180703 2183023 Riggs is hanging on the truck!
2183223 2186543 What are you doing out of the car?<br />Get in the car!
2187223 2189703 Get back! It's police business!
2190063 2192543 It's a high-speed chase!<br />Get out of the way!
2211903 2214583 I love it! We got to catch him!
2230184 2231704 Hello, asshole.
2262585 2263625 Give me that!
2279825 2282305 There they are! Hurry up!
2282585 2284305 Can't you go faster?!
2284585 2286745 Will you shut the fuck up?
2364348 2366668 Wipe out. It's under control.
2366828 2368828 I told you to look out!
2371348 2373988 - You're too old for this.<br />- Shut up! Yak-yak-yak.
2374188 2375228 And stay!
2375508 2377508 What do you think I am, a dog?
2391748 2393348 Hands behind your neck!
2398268 2401589 What are you guys doing here?<br />We got a lot to talk about.
2401989 2403389 What is going on?
2403509 2404749 Freeze!
2405269 2406269 Get down here!
2406429 2408109 Come on, it's been a bad day.
2408549 2409589 Show me your hands.
2409949 2413269 Take it easy, officer. I'm not armed.
2413949 2415549 I won't resist.
2416269 2420389 Put down your guns, gentlemen.<br />It's all right. Do as I say!
2425709 2426709 Hands on your head.
2427629 2429229 Behind your head!
2429549 2431309 You have no idea what you're doing.
2431949 2435949 We're professional police officers.<br />We do this for a living.
2436389 2438389 My name is Arjen Rudd.
2438629 2442910 I'm Minister of Diplomatic Affairs<br />for the South African consulate.
2443910 2446070 South Africa. Home of the Krugerrand.
2446310 2447910 Among other things.
2448150 2450630 These men also work for the consulate.
2450990 2452670 We have diplomatic credentials...
2455310 2457070 Keep your hands out of there.
2465430 2468430 Everybody, take it easy.<br />Especially you, Riggs.
2468670 2469670 Riggs?
2470190 2471510 You're Martin Riggs?
2471830 2474830 From Chicago. What's your name?<br />What's his name?
2475350 2476671 Pieter Von... Vor...
2476831 2478791 I'll just call you Adolf.
2479511 2483671 Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?<br />That's you.
2484471 2485791 It's official.
2487111 2488351 They are official.
2489311 2491631 Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...
2491871 2495351 ...no diplomatic agent<br />may be detained or arrested...
2495631 2498631 ...once his identity<br />has been established.
2500551 2503871 We have a serious<br />diplomatic situation here...
2504191 2507791 ...which I will take up<br />with your State Department tomorrow.
2508031 2511151 I'm quaking in my boots,<br />but I'll still bring you down.
2512231 2514032 My dear officer...
2515072 2517872 ...you could not even give me<br />a parking ticket.
2520552 2522872 Who is the dickhead now, huh?
2526552 2531392 The South African government owns<br />this house. This is South African soil.
2531832 2533512 Now get out of here.
2534792 2535952 All of you.
2544592 2546232 Don't do it.
2546512 2550512 Don't do it or I'll make you<br />eat this fucking thing.
2553273 2554433 Kaffir.
2563593 2566753 Could you step out of the car, please?
2568793 2571113 Put them away. I'm sorry.
2572873 2574313 Sorry. Are you okay?
2576273 2577273 Don't open that.
2578273 2579953 That is a diplomatic pouch...
2580233 2583953 ...protected under Article 27<br />of the Vienna Convention.
2584233 2586233 Is he serious with this stuff?
2587793 2592274 These are police officers, Miss<br />Van den Haas. They were just leaving.
2594914 2596874 She is a consulate secretary.
2597794 2599634 Give her back the briefcase.
2602314 2603914 Give it to her.
2606154 2608634 I'm sorry, Miss Consulate Secretary.
2610594 2612234 Don't talk to them! Come here.
2612474 2615154 He's a nice guy.<br />What's he paying you an hour?
2615434 2618074 Want to increase your pay?<br />Better hours?
2625274 2627595 I'd start getting used<br />to that sort of view.
2636955 2638755 It's the Triangle Trade again.
2639275 2644115 Don't you know American history?<br />Molasses to rum to slaves.
2644395 2646555 Now drugs to dollars to Krugerrands.
2646795 2650555 I got a dead guy with a surfboard<br />where his face used to be...
2650795 2654115 ...and the State Department<br />breathing down our throats.
2654395 2658875 I'll have to make a formal apology<br />to the South African consulate.
2659115 2662755 Apologize? He's a sack of shit!<br />He's a crook.
2662955 2665636 It doesn't matter. He's a diplomat.
2665916 2670156 He has immunity. We can't touch him,<br />arrest him, prosecute him.
2670396 2673556 - Does that spell it out for you?<br />- Yes, sir.
2673796 2676996 - Who the hell is this guy?<br />- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you.
2679476 2684036 You took a civilian on a bust.<br />One you're supposed to be protecting!
2684276 2685236 He's alive, isn't he?
2685436 2688916 I signed a waiver.<br />Besides, I usually wait in the car.
2689156 2690836 Usually?
2691156 2693316 They're very adamant about that.
2693596 2695676 - I don't give a fuck.<br />- They're good cops!
2695956 2698996 They're the best.<br />One time, a guy was waiving a gun...!
2699356 2700597 What did he say?
2702837 2703957 What did he say?
2704197 2705757 - "I don't give a fuck. "<br />- What's that mean?
2705957 2709677 It's his mantra. Why is everyone<br />parked on my desk? Up!
2711037 2712677 It's a rubber plant!
2712957 2715677 It looks to be about a week's supply.
2715957 2716957 Go spit.
2717197 2720197 I forgot. You're too old for that shit.
2722877 2725517 If you don't like it,<br />you can exchange it.
2749238 2751398 One moment, Miss Van den Haas.
2755718 2758718 I hope you understood<br />what happened here today.
2759078 2762078 I'd rather not jump<br />to any wrong conclusions.
2762398 2764558 Why don't you explain it to me?
2764918 2769158 The policies of our government<br />are not popular here in America.
2769838 2773358 The police department here<br />is overrun with blacks.
2773918 2776919 They have badges and guns<br />and they hate us.
2777759 2779919 Our consulate, its staff...
2780199 2784439 ...and particularly myself will always<br />be targets for their harassment.
2805279 2807359 Things are getting out of hand.
2807639 2812720 There are too many losses. We'll<br />move the cash in one large shipment.
2812960 2815240 We'll need more than a suitcase.
2815480 2819280 I'll worry about that.<br />You worry about the police.
2819720 2822200 Your warning did not work.
2830120 2831960 - Let's go, Leo!<br />- I'm coming.
2832320 2834640 Come on! Move!
2835000 2837120 Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?
2837320 2838640 I've got to eat, too.
2840960 2842600 Give me the food.
2847760 2849760 Who ordered the super combo?
2851321 2853001 I get a steak sandwich.
2853281 2854281 Who gets Leo?
2854521 2858841 You got a big empty house. I got<br />a trailer. What will I do with him?
2859121 2861441 My place is too small. You take him.
2861681 2863001 I had him last night.
2863281 2864841 Excuse me, fellows.
2865761 2868001 This is tuna. I hate tuna.
2868281 2870961 I refuse to get stuck with tuna.
2871841 2875001 - Don't eat the tuna.<br />- I just said that!
2875361 2877521 I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.
2877801 2879441 We're not going back! Shut up!
2879681 2882521 Sure, don't go back.<br />Okay, don't go back!
2882801 2885841 Let me give you<br />a friendly piece of advice.
2886201 2890162 Never go through the drive-through.<br />Always walk up to the counter.
2890362 2892042 Let me tell you why.
2892362 2895802 They fuck you at the drive-through!
2896042 2900042 They know you'll be miles away<br />before you find out you got fucked.
2900322 2902802 You won't turn around and come back.
2903042 2905562 So who gets fucked? Leo Getz.
2905802 2907402 I'm not eating this tuna!
2908042 2909402 Shut up!
2984284 2985964 Get rid of that man.
2988964 2992324 You're going to have<br />to leave the premises right now.
3002005 3003525 The morning faxes.
3040686 3043846 What's the matter?<br />He kick you out of the house?
3044806 3046966 I want you to bite Leo for me.
3058526 3059886 What are you doing?
3060726 3062806 I'm cleaning up this pigsty.
3063046 3065126 I like this pigsty.
3065366 3069206 When did you last do the refrigerator?<br />Or the pan under it?
3069486 3070806 There's a pan under there?
3072646 3074767 Where's my phone?
3075647 3077287 Where's my TV? What have you done?
3077487 3079327 Everything is outside.
3079567 3081127 Just stop what you're doing.
3081367 3084367 - Get the dog out of here!<br />- You go before the mutt.
3084727 3086567 Out, out! Oh, man.
3091727 3093407 It's Collins.
3093847 3095567 Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
3095847 3097047 No. Why?
3097327 3100407 I haven't heard from him.<br />He doesn't answer his phone.
3101487 3102847 I'll be right there.
3108407 3110087 Stay in the car.
3117608 3119008 I'm upstairs!
3119408 3121768 Should I call 999, officer in distress?
3122928 3124048 I'll cover the back!
3124248 3126608 - Where are you?<br />- I'm up here.
3143288 3144448 In here.
3159449 3160449 Good morning.
3167289 3168809 First time in 20 years...
3169049 3171089 ...I get the bathroom to myself.
3171289 3174809 No kids banging on the door.<br />No wife asking me to hurry up.
3175129 3178649 Just me and my new<br />Saltwater Sportsman magazine!
3187810 3191170 The one with the article<br />on deep-sea fishing?
3200010 3204330 So I'm reading about marlin<br />fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...
3205170 3206850 ...when I glanced over.
3212010 3213690 Oh, Jesus.
3214690 3215690 Is that all?
3215930 3217330 You scared the shit out of me.
3217530 3219370 Scared the shit out of you?
3221010 3222330 How long you been here?
3222530 3224531 I've been here all night.
3224851 3227691 My legs are so numb<br />I don't know if I can...
3227971 3229291 Don't move.
3229531 3230691 I can't.
3230971 3232851 Just stay that way. Do you mind?
3234651 3237211 It's a dirty job,<br />but someone's got to do it.
3251971 3253131 Tell me I'm not fucked.
3254651 3255971 He's fucked.
3258171 3260491 Okay, but I'd be lying.
3262052 3263932 You'll be okay if you don't stand up.
3264172 3265492 That's a relief.
3265852 3268012 - I have to get help.<br />- No way!
3268332 3269332 Why?
3272012 3274292 I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.
3274532 3278332 This is serious.<br />I got to get the bomb squad here.
3278612 3279692 Bomb squad?
3285572 3287692 Okay, call them in.
3290532 3293012 Don't use the open frequency.
3298733 3300693 Let's try to keep this quiet, okay?
3301373 3303213 Sure. Trust me.
3322213 3323893 An escort is really not necessary.
3324213 3327733 I know you're a psychiatrist,<br />but it's not a pretty sight.
3328133 3331653 I have helped policemen<br />through very traumatic moments.
3331893 3335253 There is nothing in this room<br />that I cannot handle.
3338254 3339574 I was wrong.
3340254 3341574 Excuse me.
3345934 3348534 I should've known,<br />where there's one, there's the other.
3357214 3359214 You're a psychiatrist?<br />I have these dreams.
3359614 3361254 It's ready to come out.
3363774 3365774 I got to live in this house!
3368014 3369094 Clear this room.
3370934 3371894 Come on, Riggs.
3376375 3377135 You, too, Riggs.
3377375 3378295 No.
3379775 3381615 Riggs, out.
3389015 3390135 All right.
3392895 3394135 Dive into the tub.
3395655 3397975 Then pull the bomb blanket<br />over your head.
3398455 3402255 This cast iron tub<br />will withstand a hell of a blast.
3402815 3403775 I can't.
3403975 3407135 He can't.<br />He's been on there for 18 hours.
3407415 3409095 He can't even walk.
3409335 3411136 I'm gonna have to help him.
3411976 3413656 All right, you better wear this.
3415176 3415976 The nitrogen?
3416456 3417296 Almost there.
3421096 3424496 He's spraying this thing<br />with liquid nitrogen...
3424816 3427656 ...to give you 1 or 2 seconds<br />before detonation.
3427936 3430616 - Got that?<br />- 2 seconds. Thanks a lot.
3430936 3432256 Lights out.
3432496 3434016 Get him up and out.
3442496 3443696 Good luck.
3444136 3445616 You got a piece?
3445856 3447856 - Yeah, a Smith and Wesson.<br />- Try this one.
3448137 3450337 Safety's on. I'll collect it later.
3452137 3453457 Good luck.
3467657 3469377 Alone at last.
3470697 3473537 Why didn't they plant the bomb<br />in Trish's stove?
3474057 3477217 All the needless suffering<br />could have ended there.
3490738 3492338 I'm going to die on a toilet.
3493058 3495418 Guys like you don't die on toilets.
3495618 3498458 And I'm here<br />and I don't plan on going now.
3500898 3502138 Let's do it.
3509018 3512418 On three.<br />Wait, let me get into the tub.
3513258 3515098 I'm just going to give you...
3515538 3518258 On three, huh? What do you say?
3520338 3521778 One...
3522538 3523739 ...two...
3524019 3524939 Wait.
3526939 3529419 Do we do it on three, or...
3530099 3531539 ...one, two, three...
3531779 3535459 - ... then do it?<br />- It's your ass. It's up to you.
3536699 3538459 My ass, yeah.
3538699 3539779 Three.
3540259 3541619 We go on three?
3541819 3544139 One, two and then three!
3547619 3548699 One...
3548939 3550219 Martin?
3557259 3558739 I know.
3559459 3560820 I mean it, man.
3564180 3565580 I hear you.
3568100 3570340 We're not going to die, all right?
3571620 3572820 On three.
3607861 3611261 Get off me. I don't want anybody<br />to see us like this.
3615381 3616901 Mr. Jones?
3617661 3618581 Sit down.
3622261 3624381 What can I do for you today?
3624621 3627701 I have this problem,<br />this very delicate matter.
3627941 3630181 My friend wants to emigrate<br />to South Africa.
3630501 3632661 Of course, I can help him do that.
3633741 3635342 I want you to talk him out of it.
3636262 3637182 Talk him out of it?
3637942 3639382 Whatever for?
3639942 3643542 This is a bad time for him to go,<br />with all the trouble.
3644142 3647942 Have him come back later<br />in the week and we'll sit down...
3647982 3649502 He's here.
3649742 3651822 Yeah, he's here now. Alphonse?
3662262 3664022 There must be some mistake.
3666462 3667502 Say, what?
3670262 3673823 Listen to your friend.<br />He knows what he's talking about.
3674023 3676663 I don't think you want to go<br />to South Africa.
3676943 3677983 Why not?
3681183 3682503 Because you're black.
3685783 3687063 You are.
3687303 3688583 He is.
3689223 3691983 Of course I am black.<br />That's why I want to go.
3692823 3695183 To join my brothers in the struggle...
3695383 3697303 ...against the racist...
3697503 3698223 ...fascist...
3698423 3699783 ...white minority regime!
3700063 3701023 Fascist regime!
3701263 3702423 One man, one vote!
3703623 3705943 Free South Africa, you son-of-a-bitch!
3707543 3710944 I've heard as much as I want to.<br />You must leave.
3713024 3717344 What's happening?<br />Don't touch me! Back off!
3720944 3723184 Close the security gate! Quickly!
3736464 3738064 End apartheid now!
3739504 3742504 You going to arrest me<br />if I don't shut up?
3756025 3759745 One man, one vote!<br />Free South Africa! Give me that flag!
3762505 3763625 You can't push me out!
3827307 3829107 You call this security?
3829347 3833387 More people come in and out of here<br />than Grand Central Station.
3837307 3839027 Wait, gentlemen!
3839227 3841507 Don't bother to call the police.<br />I'm here already.
3843187 3844627 I should have known.
3847387 3848667 Well, well.
3849427 3850507 The master race.
3853027 3855787 I hope you realize<br />the trouble you are in right now.
3856467 3861428 As usual, you people have everything<br />upside down and turned around.
3861668 3862828 Gentlemen...
3863508 3866188 ...show Officer Riggs into the street.
3871508 3872348 Fingers off.
3872628 3873868 Hands off!
3875188 3876508 Let me see that.
3879548 3883348 That's a piece of hardware you got.<br />Where do you get that stuff?
3883708 3886628 I've never seen it.<br />Where's it from, South Africa?
3888588 3889308 Don't move.
3896549 3901389 You haven't heard about me? I got a<br />bad reputation. Sometimes I go nuts.
3903309 3904309 Don't move.
3909349 3912109 I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.<br />Or is it Aryan?
3912389 3914389 Whatever the fuck your name is.
3915229 3917069 You fold up your tents...
3917589 3919509 ...and get out of my country...
3919989 3921989 ...and I won't do anything to you.
3922749 3924269 I'll leave you alone.
3924469 3928349 'Cause if you stick around here,<br />I'm gonna fuck your ass.
3928589 3931229 Send you home<br />with your balls in a sling.
3932749 3934750 Just get out of here...
3935430 3937270 ...Kaffir lover.
3943950 3945110 Eenie...
3945950 3947030 ...meenie...
3947270 3948170 ...miney...
3950270 3951150 Hey, Moe!
3955110 3956790 Sorry, Adolf.
3959110 3960790 Pick them up with your hands.
3962550 3965790 Big smile. Big smile!
3968110 3970110 Vorstedt, come here.
3970550 3971711 Vorstedt!
3975791 3978791 - Hello, Officer...?<br />- Martin Riggs.
3979071 3980391 What are you doing here?
3980631 3983791 I've been with your boss...<br />shooting the breeze.
3984151 3985631 Shooting his fish.
3998311 4002431 The guy goes,<br />"But, but, but... you're black!"
4005671 4006991 He's black.
4007671 4008952 No shit.
4009552 4010672 He started some shit!
4010952 4012512 You get into Rudd's office?
4012752 4014112 I got up there.
4014352 4019192 Aryan Crud and his Brown Shirts<br />turned up, but I ripped this off a pad.
4019792 4022672 "Alba Varden, Thursday. " Alba Varden?
4023432 4025032 Isn't that Hitler's girlfriend?
4025272 4026512 That's Eva Braun.
4026792 4028632 He has a date with her Thursday.
4028872 4030672 Her name sounds familiar.
4031032 4035192 I don't know her.<br />It just sounds familiar. Alba Varden.
4035512 4038192 A deli! Let's eat. I'm starving.
4038792 4039712 I'll spring.
4039952 4041872 Let's go. Sounds good.
4047153 4049953 - Get out the other side, Leo.<br />- It's okay!
4050793 4051633 No cars.
4072913 4074553 That policeman.
4085834 4087594 You should pick from the bottom.
4087834 4089514 They put the old stuff on top.
4089754 4090834 Officer Riggs!
4093074 4095034 I followed you from the consulate.
4095354 4096434 You followed me?
4096714 4100754 Well, I needed some pork chops<br />and a toilet brush, too.
4102754 4104594 I wanted to apologize...
4104914 4107754 ...for the other day,<br />if we frightened you.
4108114 4110914 I was a bit startled by all those guns.
4111434 4114274 I'm sorry.<br />And I wanted to thank you, too.
4115114 4116594 Thank me for what?
4121435 4123795 You don't like your boss<br />very much, do you?
4124955 4128275 I don't like many things<br />about my boss and my country.
4129115 4130955 But I like my job very much.
4131275 4133395 It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
4133635 4134795 You like this town?
4136475 4137635 That's a new one.
4138795 4141795 - I forgot your first name.<br />- It's Rika.
4142075 4143515 Rika Van Haagen-Dazs.
4143835 4146515 - Ice cream?<br />- No, Van den Haas. It's Dutch.
4146955 4148355 That's real pretty.
4152755 4154235 You got a rabbit at home?
4154475 4155675 It's mine.
4156075 4157235 Shop one day at a time?
4157595 4159036 Good police work, officer.
4159316 4161156 I get paid for that.
4161436 4163396 I don't shop for the entire week.
4163596 4164836 Why not?
4165676 4168476 I never know what I'll be hungry for.
4170156 4172516 Wait. Have dinner with me.
4173756 4177996 I got a nice place on the beach.<br />A good view from every window.
4178556 4183596 A beautiful sunset. Come on,<br />be original. Everyone else says no.
4183916 4186196 Come to my place. I'm a gourmet cook.
4186476 4187676 Let go of the basket.
4187876 4188796 I'll scream.
4191156 4194356 I'll embarrass you in public.<br />You'll turn red like that apple.
4194676 4197037 - Come on with me.<br />- No, no, please.
4197277 4201197 Let go of my bag! Look what she's<br />doing! Somebody call a cop!
4202477 4203877 What are you doing?
4204117 4206357 Let's go before someone calls a cop.
4206637 4208117 You are a cop.
4216877 4219197 You must be an honest cop.
4219557 4223557 It ain't much, but it's everything<br />I said. Look at the view.
4226557 4229037 I did exaggerate<br />about one thing, though.
4229237 4232557 I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.<br />I can only make chili.
4232878 4235878 - Like it with crushed Oreos?<br />- Of course.
4236238 4237958 A woman after my own heart.
4238558 4240078 Watch your step.
4240718 4242078 Sam wants in.
4242398 4246398 Here, sit down.<br />Oh, wait a minute. A little filthy.
4256598 4258878 I have no wine. How about a beer?
4259078 4260038 That's fine.
4260758 4262198 She drinks beer.
4279279 4281599 What's the matter?<br />You got a dirty glass?
4283279 4285279 Oh, it's the wedding ring.
4286959 4288599 I used to be married.
4288839 4289799 Not any more?
4291799 4293119 Not any more.
4296799 4298279 I've got something on the stove.
4302799 4306119 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials, isn't he?
4307960 4310960 Rudd's hiding behind<br />his diplomatic credentials.
4312640 4314280 He's not a very nice guy.
4316760 4318320 Whatever he's doing...
4318800 4320480 ...he shouldn't get away with it.
4328920 4330440 How's it hanging, Wyler?
4330680 4333480 - What do you want?<br />- I hope better than Murtaugh.
4333840 4335480 Easy, easy.
4336000 4340000 Tell me something. Have your brains<br />ever seen the light of day?
4340280 4342920 Who are you?<br />What do you want? I'm a cop!
4343160 4344560 No, you were a cop.
4345121 4346441 Hurry up, honey.
4346681 4350681 I'm going to take a couple laps<br />before I go to the station.
4404922 4408322 Sam, take a hike.<br />No Stooges tonight. Go on.
4430483 4431923 Get that beer in here.
4432163 4433483 Don't worry about it.
4433763 4435763 Cavanaugh, are you in or out?
4436163 4437323 I'm out.
4437683 4439003 Put some music on.
4448003 4449363 Who's not accounted for?
4449603 4450963 Riggs and Murtaugh.
4451203 4454683 Murtaugh's taking the witness<br />to a new location.
4454963 4456963 - And Riggs?<br />- Hasn't checked in yet.
4457204 4459284 Get on the radio and find them!
4459524 4463524 We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.<br />How many do we have to lose?
4463804 4467644 Let's worry about the ones<br />that are alive, all right? Do it.
4468204 4469524 Sorry, Captain.
4476564 4477964 Get me Riggs.
4485044 4486564 I'll get that.
4488884 4489804 Wrong number.
4501925 4506725 Thanks to you, I missed my poker game<br />and I was feeling real lucky.
4507565 4511725 Okay, so what I see are nice,<br />conservative tax returns.
4512085 4514685 Everything by the book,<br />black and white.
4514885 4518165 So you just need to play around<br />in the gray areas...
4518405 4520245 ...if you want to see some bucks.
4520605 4524045 On your salary, there's not much<br />to do but you need deductions.
4524245 4525725 - My boat.<br />- You can't deduct it.
4525925 4527325 No, it's the bill of sale.
4527525 4529165 I know, but you can't do it.
4530125 4532246 That's it, my boat! Let's go!
4532526 4533686 To my house.
4534046 4535486 Because of my boat.
4535726 4537366 Look at this commercial.
4537566 4540686 Look at the body on this kid.<br />She is so hot.
4541046 4545366 What are you doing? I want to look<br />at the girl! Why'd you do that?
4545606 4547446 I didn't hear you say that.
4547726 4549046 Say what? She's great.
4549286 4551966 She makes me want to buy rubbers.
4561126 4563446 Time for the seventh inning stretch.
4567806 4569647 That's a baseball expression.
4569967 4571287 I know.
4572127 4574487 But we're only up to the fourth inning.
4579967 4581407 Batter up.
4590847 4592247 Stay in the car.
4593167 4595167 I'll only be a minute, okay?
4596007 4599007 Stay in the car? It's cold.<br />You have no door.
4599287 4602447 You're the reason there's no door.<br />Turn on the heat.
4605687 4609528 Don't touch anything.<br />Nothing. I mean nothing!
4612528 4616008 Alba Varden. Why do I know the name?
4616848 4618848 It's here. It's got to be.
4619528 4623128 - Another day, another hobby.<br />- Yeah, another hobby. What's new?
4629208 4630728 That's the day on my boat.
4633328 4635048 It's not there. Where is it?
4635728 4637208 My birthday.
4665889 4667249 I'll be damned.
4667609 4670769 Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.
4672169 4674249 Leo, I told you to stay in the car!
4674929 4675688 Shit!
4741691 4743131 Nailed them both.
4756852 4758172 My car!
4761172 4762492 Leo!
4820733 4824573 Get up, get dressed.<br />Get dressed. Come on.
4829853 4834094 - I don't understand.<br />- Just trust me. I got a bad feeling.
4900895 4903815 Get in the truck.<br />The keys are under the front seat.
4904095 4907096 When they stop to reload,<br />run for the truck!
4907336 4909616 - What about you?<br />- I'll be okay.
4909816 4913176 I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!<br />Stay out of the light!
4960457 4962017 The master race.
4990338 4994058 You shit! Who were those people?
4994338 4998298 You tell me. Was it your husband?<br />What are you doing Saturday?
5009258 5010538 It's Sam!
5013938 5014738 Head down!
5033299 5035459 Come on, Sam!
5036379 5037859 Come on, Sam.
5038219 5039699 Shake a leg.
5039899 5040739 You made it.
5044619 5046299 Has he got any holes in him?
5048299 5050619 Oh, you clever dog.
5057140 5060300 I promised to have you home by 11.
5060660 5063820 This is the most incredible first date<br />I've ever been on.
5064100 5065580 Wait until the second one.
5065820 5068900 - No more helicopters, please.<br />- Okay, I promise.
5069940 5072260 This is a very nice building.
5072820 5075260 Any vacancies? I'm between homes.
5075500 5077340 You can stay right here.
5078420 5079260 I can?
5079500 5082100 Yes, there's<br />a vacant apartment up there.
5084900 5085780 I'm kidding.
5086220 5087780 You can stay with me.
5088300 5089340 Tonight?
5089620 5093341 Yes, tonight. And tomorrow night.<br />And the night after that.
5093941 5095061 And after that?
5095301 5097101 Don't push your luck.
5104181 5105941 I better go.
5107221 5109861 Go inside and lock all the doors<br />and stay there.
5110141 5112541 And you're not going to work tomorrow.
5113021 5115701 There's better ways of staying<br />in LA than working there.
5116381 5118701 All right. I've just quit.
5143662 5147822 I'll just grab a few things...<br />Hell, I haven't got anything.
5148182 5149902 Just bring yourself.
5153062 5154582 I better go.
5172503 5173703 Go home!
5188783 5190103 Go get the girl.
5211584 5214864 I would offer you a drink,<br />but I understand...
5215184 5216384 ...you're on the wagon.
5216624 5218464 That stuff will kill you quick.
5218944 5221944 You know so much about me,<br />who are you?
5226344 5228904 I changed the course of your life.
5229824 5231464 Four years ago...
5231744 5233984 ...when you was a narc at Long Beach...
5234264 5237584 ...you were getting too close,<br />so we put a contract out on you.
5237824 5239664 I handled it myself.
5239944 5242665 Drove your car right off the road,<br />remember?
5243105 5245945 But you weren't driving, were you?
5246265 5248425 You can't imagine the surprise...
5249265 5254105 ...when I pulled back a matted mop of<br />bloody hair to see this woman's face.
5255985 5257185 Your wife, right?
5259745 5261865 She didn't die straight away.
5263425 5264865 It took a bit of time.
5272185 5274465 You don't have much luck<br />with women, do you?
5432630 5434510 She's dead. They killed her.
5434990 5436110 Where are you?
5436350 5440590 They killed her. She's dead.<br />They killed them both.
5440790 5444470 Slow down. Who are you talking about?<br />Where are you?
5444710 5446550 She's dead, Roger.
5448390 5452350 Calm down. We'll take care of it.<br />Where are you?
5452870 5455550 I'm not a cop tonight. It's personal.
5456750 5459830 You don't know what happened tonight.<br />There's more.
5460830 5465390 I'm going to get those bastards.<br />I'm going to fuck them. I'm going now.
5466311 5470191 We're not going to the stilt house!<br />We're under orders!
5470391 5472671 Then the house will have to come to me.
5472911 5475071 They killed them both.
5475391 5477951 They got Rika and they got my wife.
5484111 5485071 Shit.
5498711 5499791 What's the deal?
5500751 5503591 You talk to the Feds,<br />but you don't talk to me.
5503792 5505072 That's not fair.
5509072 5510592 We trusted you.
5512672 5514392 You betrayed us.
5515952 5516952 You took our money!
5520952 5522072 We want it back now...
5522312 5524832 ...you slimy little shit.
5526552 5528712 Give him more. He likes it.
5562513 5564473 Don't try and stop me.
5564833 5567473 I've seen that look<br />in your eyes before.
5568273 5570673 They declared war on the police.
5571753 5573273 You know about that?
5573513 5575833 I heard it on the radio.
5576513 5578754 We don't have the authority.
5578994 5580154 Cavanaugh...
5580354 5582354 ...Wyler, Shapiro...
5583834 5587794 ...Rika, Vicki. How much<br />fucking authority do you need?
5589874 5591274 You got a plan?
5595714 5598114 Drive around the front of the house...
5598514 5600354 ...wait for my signal...
5601514 5604034 ...and then just go in<br />and shoot those fuckers.
5604434 5605354 They got Leo.
5607874 5608954 Be careful.
5616755 5617635 Wait.
5617995 5618955 What's your signal?
5620555 5622475 You'll know when it happens.
5625355 5627835 Somehow I think I will know.
5675436 5676436 Feel like talking?
5682436 5683556 It's the big one!
5688236 5690036 Cool it. Watch him.
5690276 5691797 Move me away from the windows!
5763038 5765359 Riggs, you crazy mother...!
5781879 5783559 Holy Christ!
5787879 5790239 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5790479 5791639 Thanks.
5792679 5794839 - Was Adolf in there?<br />- He got away.
5795879 5797879 - I'm going to find him.<br />- What about Leo?
5798079 5799359 What about Leo?
5799559 5801399 You're on your own now.
5801679 5803000 What do you mean?
5803240 5806680 Take my car to the police station<br />and wait for the Federal Marshal.
5806920 5808920 It's been an experience knowing you.
5813400 5816600 - I don't want a hug.<br />- Go on. Lucky if you see him again.
5816840 5818520 I had a lot of fun.
5819200 5820920 You do your duty now.
5821200 5823040 I'm going to really get them now.
5823360 5825040 Listen. Wait.
5826280 5828280 Is it okay if I sound the siren?
5830880 5832320 Loud as you want.
5832520 5834760 Really? Okay. Really?
5840601 5842121 Check it out.
5842361 5845721 Alba Varden is a cargo ship,<br />not a woman.
5845961 5849441 The Port Authority said<br />that the Alba Varden arrived today...
5849721 5852561 ...and heads out tomorrow<br />to South Africa.
5854801 5856561 This is the eleventh dock.
5856801 5859801 It must be here someplace.<br />I know I'm right.
5865001 5865961 The ship!
5866241 5867721 What did I tell you?
5869321 5872241 That container there<br />with three heavy hitters.
5872481 5873561 Let's have a look.
5875321 5877562 I'll take 2 of them out, you take 1.
5879362 5883002 Better yet, you take 2, I take 1.<br />Pull over to the side.
5930723 5933883 - I can't see shit!<br />- Me, either. What is this shit?
5934123 5935523 Got a light?
5937483 5939483 It's Rudd's, whatever it is.
5939723 5941723 I still can't see shit.
5943723 5946883 - You got something?<br />- I don't know. It's a car.
5952043 5954404 Shit! Fort Knox!
5958004 5959844 Hell, how much is it?
5961684 5963004 Thousands.
5964684 5966644 Fucking millions.
5967004 5969684 Billions of fucking Donald Trump lotto.
5980004 5980884 Look at this.
5981524 5983564 These are $1,000 bills!
5985604 5989765 With what I'm holding in my hand<br />I could put all my kids through college.
5991285 5992205 Take it.
5999925 6001285 Fucking drug money.
6001525 6003205 Do something good with it.
6003445 6005885 Rudd won't need it where he's going.
6018565 6020285 Load the container.
6020565 6024205 The next time the sun hits<br />their bodies, they'll be in Cape Town.
6028406 6031086 - Hey, this thing's moving.<br />- It sure as hell is.
6031486 6033966 - What are we gonna do now?<br />- I don't know.
6034646 6036206 Let's shoot our way out.
6036406 6038486 No, don't. I got a better idea.
6092887 6094207 Our money.
6097487 6099447 Make sure they're dead.
6110488 6114328 - You go first. I'm too old.<br />- You go first. I'll cover you.
6129488 6131688 - How do we get out of here?<br />- I'll go this way.
6131928 6134248 I'll go this way and check over here.
6218811 6220131 Oh, shit!
6349254 6351094 Riggs, you okay?
6367935 6369095 Drop it, asshole!
6375215 6377735 Diplomatic immunity!
6388055 6390415 It's just been revoked.
6468377 6471057 You're breathing. You're not dead.
6471817 6473377 No, don't die.
6474777 6476738 You're not dead until I tell you.
6477578 6481578 You got that, Riggs?<br />You're not dead until I tell you.
6481818 6483338 You got that?
6483738 6486218 You' re not dead until I tell you.
6486738 6488738 Now, breathe with me.
6489018 6490338 Breathe.
6495738 6497738 Rog, in my pocket.
6505938 6510578 I want you to throw those things away.<br />Those things will kill you.
6517859 6519619 You son-of-a-bitch.
6521259 6522699 I thought you were dying.
6522939 6526419 I didn't die on your toilet,<br />I'm not going to die in your arms.
6526619 6528259 You son-of-a-bitch.
