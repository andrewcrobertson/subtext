191591 194287 Cheers!
202202 203601 Excellent.
204170 206400 Let's drink until we drop.
206706 208333 Save something for your wife.
208575 211305 Are you kidding?
211678 214010 Alcohol revives me.
214214 216774 The later it gets, the hornier I get.
217116 220745 Another glass. A little sip.
223990 225753 Tell me, Jane...
226292 227589 What year are you in?
227961 228620 4th year.
228828 231023 A senior should know better.
231264 233698 What are you doing with Tun?
234133 235361 He's a hunk.
235602 238070 You keep saying that.
238304 240932 Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.
241174 241902 Then breaking their hearts.
242141 245474 Speaking of broken hearts...
245678 247077 Remember the time...
247280 250511 that girl left him a drunken mess.
250850 251817 Her name was Kay.
252051 253712 Ignore them.
255688 257781 Wait. I have a question.
258091 259956 How can a guy like you get married?
260159 261592 What's wrong with me?
262295 264855 After a long tiring day...
265231 266789 I want to head home...
267133 269431 to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.
269636 271103 Not waste my life...
271671 273730 partying with you losers.
273973 275600 Not with me.
276509 277601 A good man...
278044 280376 who went whoring with me last night.
281948 283609 Fooling around so soon?
285018 286280 Here she comes.
288821 289480 Quiet.
289689 290747 What's so funny?
292492 293481 Nothing.
293926 296190 One last thing...
296929 298829 One more glass!
317884 319181 What are we listening to?
321487 322681 Don't turn it off.
322889 324220 It's beautiful.
326893 328588 You guys seem tight.
328828 330420 Do you meet often?
334200 335326 What are you looking at?
336135 337500 Beautiful you.
339872 341100 What a sap.
383216 384683 Are you hurt?
386419 387681 Tun...
388621 390145 Is she dead?
398498 399863 Wait!
409409 410603 Drive away.
411277 412904 I said drive away!
414113 415512 Drive away!
425691 427488 Get closer, please.
428094 429061 Okay.
430096 431529 Big smile, Nuch.
432331 433628 Or you won't look pretty.
441941 443465 All Science Majors...
443709 445904 gather for a class photo.
446412 447640 They're calling you.
448681 449807 Where's Jane?
451250 453684 Taking photos with her friends.
454821 456982 I though maybe you broke up.
457890 459482 Come! Let's go.
514647 516740 I phoned but you didn't pick up.
517116 518276 Was it on silent?
527293 528920 Nuch asked about you today.
532298 534061 When will you be free?
534300 536200 She wants to...
557590 558784 Jane.
560526 562187 How can you act like this?
566032 568023 Pretending nothing happened.
570202 571328 Since that night...
571571 573163 I haven't slept soundly.
577109 578804 I'm upset as well.
580880 583212 At least we should have checked.
585117 587278 It was an accident.
588554 590215 That's easy for you to say.
591724 593453 You weren't behind the wheel.
605571 607095 - Hi, Ti.<br />- Hey.
607640 609403 How's business?
609709 611677 With you here this early...
612078 613978 business should be bad.
615715 617512 Are my prints ready?
618451 620180 Yeah. Just a sec.
625091 626149 Here.
649448 650745 Is your processor broken?
652251 653377 Let's see.
658190 659452 The nerve.
659659 661024 Nice prints and you're great.
661227 663661 If they suck, it's my fault.
664030 665429 Let's check the negative.
666399 667627 No way.
667833 669164 I took them. I should know.
669402 670494 We'll see.
672872 673964 See.
675274 676935 Your negative are bad.
700099 701259 Tun.
711510 712909 Tun.
729595 730892 Tun.
732898 734331 Can you hear me?
858123 859420 Help!
860492 862050 Help!
894693 897161 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
916882 918247 What's wrong with your camera?
919585 920552 I don't' know.
920753 922277 The whole roll is ruined.
924924 926619 That many?
932331 933889 What are these shadows?
934934 936595 My camera must be broken.
938671 940400 How should I tell Nuch?
944343 945640 Tun...
947112 948511 Look at this picture.
959658 960818 That woman...
961961 963292 Do you think she's dead?
964029 965087 That's enough.
970402 972700 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
1035100 1035930 Tun...
1036135 1037466 Look at this picture.
1061293 1062851 Are you sure it was here?
1070102 1071000 Excuse me.
1071203 1072170 What happened?
1072604 1076005 A few days ago a car hit the billboard.
1076442 1077670 Must have been drunk.
1079678 1081646 Was anyone hurt?
1082681 1083773 No.
1084316 1085647 Just the broken sign.
1085884 1087181 Are you sure?
1087419 1088283 What?
1089755 1091313 Nothing.
1092624 1093818 Thank you.
1095794 1096886 What?
1099064 1101191 You sure you checked everywhere?
1104703 1106000 Nothing.
1106672 1107900 Thanks anyways.
1112778 1115178 He called every precinct and hospital.
1116782 1120218 No accidents were reported that night.
1120619 1122018 That's not possible.
1123222 1124951 What about the girl we hit?
1126625 1128855 You sure he called every one?
1129128 1130891 Maybe someone helped her.
1131463 1133328 Maybe she's fine.
1133599 1134964 How could she be fine?
1135200 1136963 We ploughed her down.
1139972 1141633 And even if she's fine...
1143242 1144903 Something is in those pictures.
1145377 1148005 I told you they're not related to her.
1148514 1149640 They're just bad exposures.
1149848 1151281 Get it?
1212711 1213735 Tun...
1214413 1216005 You need to make some merit.
1217482 1218642 These pictures...
1219017 1221212 show that a spirit is haunting you.
1227492 1229892 How long have you been a photographer?
1230095 1231722 Why are you showing me these?
1232064 1232962 I know...
1233465 1235592 But don't you find these shadows strange?
1238103 1239400 You want to see spirits?
1240405 1241633 I'll show you some.
1249615 1250343 Here.
1251049 1252175 Auntie Cham's spirit.
1253185 1254482 You know where she is now?
1257489 1260253 She's selling grilled bananas next door.
1261960 1263291 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1264029 1265087 All Auntie Cham.
1265631 1266825 Taken on the same day.
1267199 1268359 They're just double exposures...
1268600 1270067 and out of focus.
1271003 1273801 Come on. I know that.
1282114 1284207 Everyone is familiar with this place.
1285751 1288015 Just an ordinary location...
1289388 1290980 that we pass...
1291590 1293080 and see everyday.
1298630 1300495 Now look at these pictures...
1304403 1307201 taken of the same place.
1308040 1309302 In these...
1310442 1312000 the bridge looks nicer.
1314212 1315474 That means photography...
1315914 1320180 does not reproduce reality.
1322521 1323818 It depends on how...
1324823 1327417 the image is framed.
1328026 1329516 What is revealed.
1329895 1331522 What is concealed.
1332731 1335325 Your perspective is critical.
1346678 1350205 "Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures"
1362694 1364093 Jane, you're early.
1366565 1367793 I'll get it.
1372804 1374465 - Hello?<br />- Hello, Tun.
1374706 1376674 It's Jane. I'll come by later.
1378110 1378804 Hello?
1379044 1381103 Tun, can you hear me?
1381346 1382574 Hello?
1382781 1384043 Tun!
1384282 1385544 Tun!
1386284 1387342 Hello?
1387552 1389076 Hello?
1416448 1417710 What's wrong?
1418517 1419484 I don't' know.
1419684 1421652 My neck's hurt since the accident.
1422721 1424382 You should go see a doctor.
1426291 1427553 I'm sure it's not serious.
1430996 1432623 What's the use of talking to these spoofs?
1434299 1436790 "Real Ghosts"
1439304 1440703 Are you a reporter?
1440972 1441996 No.
1443074 1445542 The funeral foundation sent us.
1447779 1449974 We run a legal operation.
1450282 1452045 We have all the right permits.
1499531 1500589 Excuse me.
1501032 1503330 Are all these pictures fakes?
1504970 1507302 Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.
1510141 1511472 Everyone fakes them.
1512978 1514002 You know...
1514279 1516144 these photos are always a hit.
1517315 1519306 Any issue with them sells out.
1520385 1521352 But you think...
1521786 1523481 we can always find real ones?
1525757 1527918 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1529327 1531022 Our readers...
1531663 1533654 want to see scary photos.
1535000 1536558 They don't want loves stories.
1538303 1541704 Does that mean every photo is fake?
1544809 1546640 I didn't say that.
1560191 1561317 Take a look.
1562294 1563693 See anything?
1564329 1566627 This is the first photo I had.
1567866 1569231 I took it at home.
1571002 1572230 The shadow...
1572504 1574972 bears a likeness to my mom.
1578310 1580005 Believe what you will.
1582113 1583205 But this picture...
1584015 1586848 was taken after she passed away.
1588853 1590252 You know...
1590522 1591511 sometimes...
1591723 1594157 spirits long for their loved ones.
1600398 1601763 In my opinion...
1602634 1603931 these pictures...
1605103 1606570 represent more than...
1607205 1609173 macabre urban legends.
1611409 1613604 They are signs.
1618216 1619513 Think about it.
1620819 1622309 Why would the dead...
1623088 1624680 return to the living...
1628059 1630926 Without a message to convey?
1635233 1636598 Most importantly...
1637502 1638901 I believe...
1639971 1641404 these shadows...
1642140 1644608 are related to someone in the picture.
1648880 1650142 A father...
1650515 1651573 mother...
1651883 1653214 or lover.
1655320 1656582 Or someone...
1656788 1658779 you maligned in life.
1681746 1684408 How can we tell if they're real...
1684616 1685947 and not fakes?
1686317 1687750 What about Polaroid's?
1687952 1689351 Can you fake them?
1692791 1697160 You load the film and press the shutter.
1697595 1698892 The photo ejects.
1716715 1718376 Tell me then...
1719150 1721084 How can they be faked?
1725023 1727617 How do we know what they want?
1728226 1729215 Perhaps...
1729494 1731325 the answer is in the photo.
1741806 1743671 Two more poses.
1744542 1745975 Big smiles.
1749814 1752374 Let's have a different pose.
1753017 1755918 Embrace her, hold the bouquet...
1756121 1758146 and kiss her cheek.
1760525 1761583 Beautiful.
1763161 1765026 We're done.
1765396 1767762 Thank you both.
1768199 1770394 Take them to the dressing room.
1795727 1797058 What the...
1798863 1800125 Who's doing that?
1800698 1802131 Aum, check the fuse!
1804035 1805434 Hey! Aum!
1808573 1809403 Aum!
1810675 1811801 Who's doing that?
1813077 1815045 Is it you, Aum?
1821319 1822479 Who is it?
1825156 1826646 Aum, where are you?
1828693 1830160 Who's there!
1830829 1832091 I asked who it is!
1840171 1841763 Where are you, Aum?
1847011 1848410 Who's there!
1897662 1899254 Please step off the scale.
1902834 1904426 Step on it again.
1912243 1913870 Been working hard lately?
1914112 1915602 Not really.
1916247 1917680 How long has it hurt?
1918650 1920481 For quite awhile.
1920685 1922550 But it's gotten worse lately.
1923021 1925182 I had a car accident.
1925790 1927052 An accident?
1927692 1929557 Physically, you're fine.
1930728 1932059 You shouldn't worry.
1932997 1935488 But it really hurts.
1936701 1938862 Your x-rays are normal.
1939203 1940727 It may be a sprain.
1941072 1943131 Try the medicine I prescribed.
1944442 1946501 Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.
1950481 1951709 Take this medicine...
1952083 1954347 3 times a day after meals...
1954619 1956849 until the prescription runs out.
1958890 1960084 Lying bastard.
1961292 1962088 Pardon?
1962293 1963351 Yes?
1964696 1966186 Nothing.
1970835 1972496 Lying bastard.
1974205 1975502 Lying bastard.
1976641 1978108 As for this medicine...
1980044 1980703 Sir!
1980945 1982810 What's wrong?
1985817 1987375 ...is rarely seen.
1987885 1990319 When grasshoppers begin mating...
1990822 1993757 the male smells the female...
1994559 1998154 from a distance up to 100 meters.
1998963 2002558 The male carefully approaches the female.
2003334 2006394 It hooks itself onto her belly.
2007105 2008902 And they begin to mate.
2010508 2014205 The female's response is surprising.
2015380 2018747 The male becomes her prey.
2019384 2023013 She slowly eats off his head...
2023588 2026148 while they are mating.
2028059 2029048 Eventually...
2029260 2031421 the male succumbs to death.
2040104 2043403 Excuse me, where is Room 301?
2049747 2050645 Jane.
2054685 2056118 Jane.
2065563 2066825 Jane.
2135700 2136860 Who's there?
2165530 2166656 Tonn...
2167565 2168930 What's wrong?
2172503 2173470 Tun...
2173671 2175104 I'm going to die.
2175306 2176933 What's going on?
2177608 2178700 The photos...
2180311 2181744 Bring me those photos.
2182813 2184007 What photos?
2184282 2185306 Are you drunk?
2186984 2188315 Those photos...
2188753 2190277 Where did you hide them?
2190521 2191818 Give them to me.
2193524 2194957 Remember that bitch.
2195226 2196215 Calm down.
2197361 2198191 What photos?
2198396 2200023 Just give them to me!
2200398 2202093 Please calm down.
2203301 2204700 Tonn, calm down.
2205503 2206902 What photos?
2212043 2213203 Tonn.
2213411 2214844 I'll call your wife.
2257688 2258916 What are you doing?
2260458 2261982 Cleaning up.
2268065 2269498 Your neck still sore?
2271502 2272662 Yeah.
2272903 2274962 Take it easy. Don't work so much.

2559290 2560450 Tonn.
2561292 2562782 It's Tun.
2564395 2565862 Are you home?
2580010 2581102 Tonn.
2583414 2584904 Are you home?
2593724 2594884 Tonn.
2619583 2620811 "Natrenapa Chan-ngam"
2667931 2669421 Tonn!
2670134 2671226 Tonn!
2673103 2674263 Tonn!
2681211 2682701 Tonn!
2718215 2720979 I'm really sorry.
2722286 2723514 Do you know...
2723754 2725221 What was bothering him?
2729093 2730617 No. Suddenly he...
2730828 2733058 It's your gang's fault.
2735399 2737128 Have you all gone insane?
2738435 2740027 What do you mean?
2741205 2743173 You've all committed suicide.
2744508 2745634 Who?
2747044 2748477 Don't you know?
2749146 2750613 The other two...
2751014 2753039 also killed themselves.
2753751 2754979 Which two?
2758255 2762055 The two who sat next to you.
2806370 2807803 Who's this woman?
2812176 2813575 Where did you get that?
2814845 2816904 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2818549 2819709 Who is she?
2822619 2824587 How is she related to you?
2842940 2844908 I knew her in college.
2848011 2849501 Her name is Natre.
2853083 2855074 She was a quiet person...
2856820 2858185 without any friends.
2862326 2864191 We all thought she was weird.
2869366 2870958 I felt sorry for her.
2878208 2880403 We dated but I kept it secret.
2883947 2885312 She loved me a lot.
3056486 3058181 She threatened to slit her wrists.
3059990 3061617 I didn't know what to do.
3062192 3063887 My friends thought it was funny.
3064394 3065918 How were they involved?
3066463 3067760 Why are they dead?
3068365 3069491 They...
3069699 3070757 What did they do?
3073203 3074431 I don't know.
3075806 3078172 Tonn said he'd take care of it.
3082112 3083807 After that, Natre disappeared.
3085649 3087674 I never saw her again.
3088685 3090778 Didn't you try to stop them?
3092889 3095551 How could you let it happen?
3102099 3103589 What could I do?
3106002 3107629 Now everyone is dead.
3111174 3112402 I'm...
3113376 3114900 I'm going to die next.
3153650 3154947 It's funny how...
3157287 3159187 we always say...
3160123 3161886 if we could turn back time...
3163660 3164592 we...
3164828 3166796 we would reverse all our wrongs.
3170200 3171827 Do you think she's okay?
3173270 3174635 Will she be there?
3175071 3176163 Go to sleep.
3178775 3180265 I'll keep you company tonight.
3304901 3306061 Excuse me.
3307370 3308803 Do you have any toilet paper?
3343807 3345206 Can I poo first?
3345408 3346807 I'm sorry.
3415945 3417173 What's bothering you?
3431027 3432585 Tun. What's wrong?
3444707 3446072 What is it?
3497727 3498989 Is it around here?
3509906 3511203 Excuse me.
3511808 3513070 Do you know where this is?
3517480 3519380 Mom, where is this house?
3553349 3554611 Ma'am.
3567130 3568222 Excuse me...
3568464 3569863 Is this Natre's house?
3571834 3572994 What do you want?
3574304 3575328 Well...
3575705 3577866 We're her friends.
3578841 3580832 Natre's friends? Come inside.
3591921 3594389 Have some water. You must be tired.
3594724 3596316 Did you drive from Bangkok?
3597527 3598551 Yes.
3601664 3605691 We'd like to ask about Natre.
3606736 3608397 She's not feeling well.
3608805 3610102 She's taking a nap.
3611608 3613007 Should I wake her?
3617380 3618972 Stay for dinner.
3619849 3621077 I was about to cook.
3621284 3623650 I'm making her favourite dish.
3625355 3626913 Natre will be so happy.
3627423 3629254 Her friends don't visit often.
3629859 3631258 Wait right here.
3650213 3651475 Where are you going?
3726122 3727419 How dare you?
3733463 3735431 Did she commit suicide?
3740369 3742496 We should cremate her.
3744440 3745407 No.
3745608 3746973 I won't cremate her.
3749412 3750401 Ma'am...
3752048 3754915 I don't know if you believe such things...
3755384 3758751 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3759555 3762888 They were taken around campus.
3765194 3767526 Some of the places...
3768297 3771198 were rooms Natre had been in.
3772034 3775970 And these shadows appeared
3779542 3780770 I think that...
3782011 3785105 Natre's spirit is restless.
3786582 3787810 Natre...
3791454 3792921 My dear Natre.
3795124 3797024 Why don't you visit me?
3805501 3807901 Can you tell me what happened?
3808805 3810466 Why she left Bangkok?
3818981 3820243 Ma'am...
3822485 3823645 Ma'am.
3825021 3826648 These shadows...
3827223 3830556 might mean her spirit is not at peace.
3834897 3837092 We should hold her funeral.
3838634 3839965 Please.
3854150 3855378 When she came home...
3855585 3857018 she seemed different.
3857386 3859149 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
3859722 3861713 No one knows what happened in Bangkok.
3863693 3865854 Then she overdosed on pills.
3866562 3868962 Luckily, her mother found her...
3869332 3871197 and got her to the hospital on time.
3871701 3873965 When she recovered...
3875304 3878171 she climbed on the hospital roof...
3878808 3880332 and jumped off the edge.
3882511 3885275 Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?
3887383 3890614 She's been distraught<br />ever since Natre's death.
3891354 3895017 No matter what she refused to cremate her.
3896359 3898554 All the villagers were scared.
3898928 3901726 No one wanted to socialize with her.
4024453 4025681 Can't sleep?
4031494 4033553 Tell me the truth...
4034530 4036191 Did you love Natre?
4040002 4041731 I tried to...
4048010 4050501 I believed that one day I would.
4056252 4058152 But I was fooling myself.
4066162 4067595 When I broke it off...
4068831 4071265 I was a total asshole.
4077273 4079207 But she still loved me the same.
4085781 4087612 I want this to be over.
4089685 4092119 If she wants me to die I will.
4093189 4094850 Don't say that.
4095858 4097450 It's almost over.
4098828 4099954 No it's not.
4105134 4107398 I know she'll come for me.
4108304 4109362 Tun.
4110272 4111933 We've come this far.
4114276 4116244 And you're sorry for what you did.
4117213 4118771 I'm sure she knows.
4121150 4122777 Don't talk about death anymore.
4129892 4131291 I'm sorry.
4136932 4138695 Do you still love me?
4144640 4147473 No matter what you won't leave me, right?
4246675 4248700 Jane.
4341804 4343101 Tun...
4343472 4344461 Jane...
4345007 4346497 Where did you go?
4347810 4349300 Why did you leave me alone?
4350212 4351304 We've got to leave.
4354917 4356316 Asshole!
4357553 4359020 Why did you leave me?
4359221 4360916 Didn't you love me?
4361357 4362654 How could you leave me?
4365728 4367593 How could you leave me?
4466929 4468123 Tun...
4468497 4470055 Are you feeling better?
4472601 4474592 What happened last night?
4476071 4477129 Tun...
4478807 4479774 Jane...
4479975 4481101 Jane...
4488250 4489182 The abbot said...
4489384 4491352 Natre will be cremated today.
4494990 4496548 It's over.
4612441 4613999 - Hello.<br />- Hello, Jane.
4614610 4615634 Picking up photos?
4616445 4617343 Where's Tun?
4617546 4618774 He's busy.
4619247 4620339 Good.
4620549 4621379 When he's busy...
4621583 4623050 I get to see you.
4631159 4632490 You went on vacation?
4633328 4634386 To the beach.
4634930 4636056 When did you go?
4636765 4638289 Last week.
4640636 4642627 This photo is...
4646141 4647301 What's wrong?
4653482 4654710 You look fatter.
4657085 4658484 I didn't recognize you.
4660989 4661956 Hi.
4662958 4664152 Jumbo prints.
4665861 4667089 Write you name, please.
4826555 4827817 Get her guys!
4863491 4864583 Jane...
4864993 4866722 Why are you crying?
4869631 4870723 Asshole...
4873335 4875303 How could you be so cruel?
4880942 4882375 Where did you find these?
4884980 4886572 If I didn't find them...
4886781 4889011 I'd be a fool forever, right?
4894623 4896113 Let me explain.
4899361 4901056 What's there to say?
4905400 4906992 I always believed you.
4914109 4916043 I thought I knew you.
4930025 4931083 Tun.
4932327 4933453 Take her picture...
4933728 4934922 so she doesn't blab.
4935130 4937121 Tun, help me.
4938800 4939960 I know it was wrong.
4941603 4943400 Take her picture now!
4944572 4945698 What's wrong!
4947242 4948709 I'm your buddy!
4949210 4950234 Hurry!
4958920 4960751 Tun, help me.
4974202 4975499 I never forgave myself.
4975704 4977672 But I was young and stupid.
4979240 4980605 I've heard enough.
4982711 4984201 I'm going home.
5039100 5040431 Come on out!
5045240 5046605 Where are you?
5053148 5054775 I thought you loved me!
5057118 5058813 Loved me so much!
5066294 5068489 Till death do us part!
5073601 5075228 She's gone now.
5174502 5175730 Sometimes...
5175970 5178302 spirits long for their loved ones.
