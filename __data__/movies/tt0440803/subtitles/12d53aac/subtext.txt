222958 224333 Excellent.
224750 227500 Let's drink until we drop.
227541 229375 Save something for your wife.
229625 232458 Are you kidding?
232916 235041 Alcohol revives me.
235458 238083 The later it gets, the hornier I get.
239958 242375 Another glass. A little sip.
245541 247500 Tell me, Jane...
247916 249125 What year are you in?
249833 250708 4th year.
250958 252875 A senior should know better.
253333 256041 What are you doing with Tun?
256375 257750 He's a hunk.
258458 260416 You keep saying that.
260916 263583 Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.
263625 264750 Then breaking their hearts.
264791 267416 Speaking of broken hearts...
268041 269916 Remember the time...
269958 272666 that girl left him a drunken mess.
273750 275833 Her name was Kay.
276083 278041 Ignore them.
278958 280833 Wait. I have a question.
281208 283083 How can a guy like you get married?
283125 284833 What's wrong with me?
285541 288250 After a long tiring day...
288583 290416 I want to head home...
290750 293166 to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.
293208 295208 Not waste my life...
295250 298333 partying with you losers.
298375 299750 Not with me.
300333 301750 A good man...
301791 304833 who went whoring with me last night.
306250 307791 Fooling around so soon?
309166 310708 Here she comes.
313083 314208 Quiet.
314250 315875 What's so funny?
317000 318041 Nothing.
318625 320916 One last thing...
321541 323291 One more glass!
343291 345333 What are we listening to?
346916 348833 Don't turn it off.
348875 350250 It's beautiful.
352750 354500 You guys seem tight.
354750 356958 Do you meet often?
360375 361916 What are you looking at?
362458 363875 Beautiful you.
366333 368375 What a sap.
411458 412500 Are you hurt?
414750 415750 Tun...
416958 417875 Is she dead?
427416 428333 Wait!
438583 439666 Drive away.
440875 442166 I said drive away!
443583 445333 Drive away!
455875 457666 Get closer, please.
458041 459291 Okay.
460208 461791 Big smile, Nuch.
462333 464166 Or you won't look pretty.
472458 474458 All Science Majors...
474500 476666 gather for a class photo.
477458 478750 They're calling you.
479250 480791 Where's Jane?
482291 484958 Taking photos with her friends.
485791 488833 I thought maybe you broke up.
489250 491583 Come! Let's go.
548291 550583 I phoned but you didn't pick up.
550958 552375 Was it on silent?
561416 563666 Nuch asked about you today.
566666 568958 When will you be free?
569250 570958 She wants to...
593083 594041 Jane.
596166 598750 How can you act like this?
601791 604291 Pretending nothing happened.
606041 607416 Since that night...
607458 609166 I haven't slept soundly.
613458 615583 I'm upset as well.
617458 620166 At least we should have checked.
621875 623916 It was an accident.
625291 626958 That's easy for you to say.
628666 631041 You weren't behind the wheel...
643000 644583 Hi, Ti. / Hey.
645166 646958 How's business?
647375 649416 With you here this early...
649750 651833 business should be bad.
653625 655458 Are my prints ready?
656500 658416 Yeah. Just a sec.
663291 664083 Here.
688750 690291 Is your processor broken?
691583 692833 Let's see.
697958 699125 The nerve.
699416 701166 Nice prints and you're great.
701458 703666 If they suck it's my fault.
703958 706041 Let's check the negative.
706375 707583 No way.
707958 709416 I took them. I should know.
709666 710666 We'll see.
713125 714125 See.
715500 717833 Your negatives are bad.
741458 742458 Tun.
753333 754166 Tun.
772333 773333 Tun.
775666 777291 Can you hear me?
906000 907000 Help!
908666 909875 Help!
944083 946833 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
967458 969583 What's wrong with your camera?
970083 971541 I don't know.
971583 973791 The whole roll is ruined.
975583 977375 That many?
983375 985250 What are these shadows?
986041 987833 My camera must be broken.
989833 992125 How should I tell Nuch?
995875 996750 Tun...
998666 1000291 Look at this picture.
1011708 1012958 That woman...
1014208 1015750 Do you think she's dead?
1016458 1017791 That's enough.
1023958 1026083 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
1090375 1091166 Tun...
1091416 1093041 Look at this picture.
1117875 1119666 Are you sure it was here?
1127041 1128125 Excuse me.
1128166 1129416 What happened?
1130958 1133541 A few days ago a car hit the billboard.
1133583 1135166 Must have been drunk.
1136958 1139041 Was anyone hurt?
1140125 1141125 No.
1141916 1143208 Just the broken sign.
1143250 1144416 Are you sure?
1145041 1146083 What?
1147875 1149291 Nothing.
1150500 1151750 Thank you.
1153625 1154916 What?
1157125 1159833 You sure you checked everywhere?
1163166 1164166 Nothing.
1165041 1166666 Thanks anyways.
1171375 1174458 He called every precinct and hospital.
1175541 1179083 No accidents were reported that night.
1179583 1181166 That's not possible.
1182250 1184250 What about the girl we hit?
1185750 1188291 You sure he called every one?
1188750 1190708 Maybe someone helped her.
1191208 1193166 Maybe she's fine.
1193208 1194833 How could she be fine?
1194875 1196875 We ploughed her down.
1199500 1201875 And even if she's fine...
1203125 1205041 Something is in those pictures.
1205458 1208250 I told you they're not related to her.
1208541 1210041 They're just bad exposures.
1210083 1211125 Get it?
1275333 1276333 Tun...
1277000 1279250 You need to make some merit.
1280208 1281333 These pictures...
1281958 1284666 show that a spirit is haunting you.
1290750 1293500 How long have you been a photographer?
1293541 1295250 Why are you showing me these?
1295500 1296666 I know...
1297000 1299875 But don't you find these shadows strange?
1301916 1303625 You want to see spirits?
1304166 1305666 I'll show you some.
1313791 1314750 Here.
1315333 1316666 Auntie Cham's spirit.
1317625 1319166 You know where she is now?
1321958 1325166 She's selling grilled bananas next door.
1326708 1328375 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1328875 1330416 All Auntie Cham.
1330458 1331875 Taken on the same day.
1332208 1333708 They're just double exposures...
1334041 1335333 and out of focus.
1336333 1339333 Come on. I know that.
1347666 1350333 Everyone is familiar with this place.
1351416 1354291 Just an ordinary location...
1355333 1356750 that we pass...
1357458 1359583 and see everyday.
1364875 1367000 Now look at these pictures...
1370916 1374250 taken of the same place.
1374625 1375833 In these...
1377708 1379291 the bridge looks nicer.
1381125 1384416 That means photography...
1384833 1388041 does not reproduce reality.
1389833 1391500 It depends on how...
1392125 1395083 the image is framed.
1395458 1397125 What is revealed.
1397416 1399291 What is concealed.
1400416 1403250 Your perspective is critical.

1431375 1432875 Jane, you're early.
1434958 1436708 I'll get it.
1442291 1444083 Hello? / Hello, Tun.
1444416 1446625 It's Jane. I'll come by later.
1447625 1448541 Hello?
1448833 1451083 Tun, can you hear me?
1451666 1452750 Hello?
1452791 1453750 Tun!
1454291 1455250 Tun!
1455541 1456583 Hello?
1457750 1458708 Hello?
1487458 1488625 What's wrong?
1489500 1490750 I don't know.
1491000 1493375 My neck's hurt since the accident.
1494208 1496250 You should go see a doctor.
1497833 1499583 I'm sure it's not serious.
1502750 1504875 What's the use of talking to these spoofs?
1506083 1509375 <i>Real Ghosts</i>
1511458 1512833 Are you a reporter?
1513083 1514125 No.
1515416 1518208 The funeral foundation sent us.
1520333 1522833 We run a legal operation.
1523125 1525416 We have all the right permits.
1574083 1575375 Excuse me.
1575750 1578250 Are all these pictures fakes?
1579708 1582541 Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.
1585250 1586958 Everyone fakes them.
1588166 1589333 You know...
1589375 1591666 these photos are always a hit.
1592750 1595166 Any issue with them sells out.
1595916 1596750 But you think...
1597333 1599541 we can always find real ones?
1601500 1604000 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1605250 1607333 Our readers...
1607708 1610083 want to see scary photos.
1611041 1613041 They don't want love stories.
1614625 1618208 Does that mean every photo is fake?
1621333 1623750 I didn't say that.
1637291 1638250 Take a look.
1639416 1640541 See anything?
1641666 1644583 This is the first photo I had.
1645250 1646875 I took it at home.
1648541 1650041 The shadow...
1650083 1652708 bears a likeness to my mom.
1656166 1658500 Believe what you will.
1660208 1661583 But this picture...
1662333 1665000 was taken after she passed away.
1667333 1668416 You know...
1668875 1669916 sometimes...
1670208 1673041 spirits long for their loved ones.
1679333 1680958 In my opinion...
1681583 1683333 these pictures...
1684125 1686208 represent more than...
1686250 1688875 macabre urban legends.
1690666 1693250 They are signs.
1697750 1699250 Think about it.
1700500 1702291 Why would the dead...
1702958 1705166 return to the living...
1708083 1711375 without a message to convey?
1715416 1717083 Most importantly...
1717833 1719708 I believe...
1720375 1721666 these shadows...
1722708 1725958 are related to someone in the picture.
1729541 1731000 A father...
1731375 1732333 mother...
1732791 1734333 or lover.
1736333 1737833 Or someone...
1738333 1740166 you maligned in life.
1764000 1766791 How can we tell if they're real...
1767041 1768333 and not fakes?
1768875 1772000 What about polaroids?
1775416 1776750 Can you fake them?
1777583 1779875 You load the film and press the shutter.
1780375 1782000 The photo ejects.
1800375 1802291 Tell me then...
1803125 1805125 How can they be faked?
1809083 1812000 How do we know what they want?
1812458 1813458 Perhaps...
1813708 1816458 the answer is in the photo.
1826416 1828708 Two more poses.
1829333 1831000 Big smiles.
1834416 1837333 Let's have a different pose.
1838250 1841166 Embrace her, hold the bouquet...
1841208 1843583 and kiss her cheek.
1845916 1847250 Beautiful.
1848750 1850666 We're done.
1851041 1853750 Thank you both.
1854125 1856666 Take them to the dressing room.
1882708 1884333 What the...
1885958 1887416 Who's doing that?
1887875 1889625 Aum, check the fuse!
1891375 1892666 Hey! Aum!
1898166 1899666 Who's doing that?
1900791 1902875 Is it you, Aum?
1909333 1910291 Who is it?
1913333 1914833 Who's there!
1916958 1918416 I asked who it is!
1929125 1931583 Where are you, Aum?
1935958 1936958 Who's there!
1989083 1990458 Please step off the scale.
1994458 1996541 Step on it again.
2004583 2006000 Been working hard lately?
2006583 2007875 Not really.
2008666 2010250 How long has it hurt?
2010833 2012666 For quite awhile.
2012708 2015291 But it's gotten worse lately.
2016208 2018000 I had a car accident.
2018291 2019708 An accident?
2020333 2022708 Physically, you're fine.
2023458 2025083 You shouldn't worry.
2025666 2028791 But it really hurts.
2029666 2032125 Your x-rays are normal.
2032375 2034166 It may be a sprain.
2034208 2036833 Try the medicine I prescribed.
2037875 2040041 Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.
2044041 2045583 Take this medicine...
2045625 2048583 3 times a day after meals...
2048625 2050958 until the prescription runs out.
2052791 2054458 Lying bastard.
2055541 2056500 Pardon?
2056541 2057458 Yes?
2058875 2060541 Nothing.
2065291 2067041 Lying bastard.
2068791 2070791 Lying bastard.
2071333 2072958 As for this medicine...
2074125 2075500 Sir!
2075875 2077791 What's wrong?
2080791 2082708 ...is rarely seen.
2083000 2086041 When grasshoppers begin mating...
2086083 2089583 the male smells the female...
2089916 2094083 from a distance up to 100 meters.
2094500 2098125 The male carefully approaches the female.
2099166 2102750 It hooks itself onto her belly.
2103166 2105250 And they begin to mate.
2106500 2110541 The female's response is surprising.
2111666 2115458 The male becomes her prey.
2115791 2119791 She slowly eats off his head...
2120541 2123083 while they are mating.
2124583 2125916 Eventually...
2125958 2128500 the male succumbs to death.
2137458 2140791 Excuse me, where is Room 301?
2152666 2153625 Jane.

2281000 2282041 The photos...
2283458 2285208 Bring me those photos.
2285958 2287333 What photos?
2287375 2288666 Are you drunk?
2290458 2291666 Those photos...
2292416 2293666 Where did you hide them?
2293916 2295208 Give them to me.
2297375 2298916 Remember that bitch.
2298958 2300333 Calm down.
2301333 2302166 What photos?
2302416 2304208 Just give them to me!
2304458 2306458 Please calm down.
2307375 2309208 Tonn, calm down.
2309500 2311500 What photos?
2316416 2317458 Tonn.
2317750 2319833 I'll call your wife.
2364000 2365333 What are you doing?
2367166 2368750 Cleaning up.
2374875 2376583 Your neck still sore?
2378750 2379958 Yeah.

2741458 2743041 Natrenapa Chan-ngam
2791416 2792375 Tonn!
2793791 2794750 Tonn!
2796750 2797708 Tonn!
2805458 2807166 Tonn!
2845041 2846750 I'm really sorry.
2847833 2849125 Do you know...
2849458 2851208 what was bothering him?
2855166 2856791 No. Suddenly he...
2856833 2859625 It's your gang's fault.
2861708 2863375 Have you all gone insane?
2864875 2866750 What do you mean?
2867666 2870166 You've all committed suicide.
2871166 2872416 Who?
2873916 2875500 Don't you know?
2875833 2877458 The other two...
2877750 2879666 also killed themselves.
2880708 2882083 Which two?
2885375 2889041 The two who sat next to you.
2935458 2937291 Who's this woman?
2941625 2943125 Where did you get that?
2944375 2947041 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2948125 2949708 Who is she?
2952541 2954666 How is she related to you?
2973708 2975875 I knew her in college.
2978916 2980375 Her name is Natre.
2984208 2986125 She was a quiet person...
2988291 2989541 without any friends.
2993750 2996166 We all thought she was weird.
3001125 3002958 I felt sorry for her.
3010375 3013208 We dated but I kept it secret.
3016333 3018166 She loved me a lot.
3196083 3198583 She threatened to slit her wrists.
3199750 3201833 I didn't know what to do.
3201875 3204083 My friends thought it was funny.
3204125 3206375 How were they involved?
3206416 3208083 Why are they dead?
3208416 3209166 They...
3209666 3211333 What did they do?
3213541 3215000 I don't know.
3216625 3219208 Tonn said he'd take care of it.
3222666 3225166 After that, Natre disappeared.
3226375 3228625 I never saw her again.
3229666 3232333 Didn't you try to stop them?
3234000 3236375 How could you let it happen?
3243625 3245625 What could I do?
3247791 3249916 Now everyone is dead.
3253458 3254500 I'm...
3255333 3257250 I'm going to die next.
3297208 3298708 It's funny how...
3300958 3303458 we always say...
3303875 3306541 if we could turn back time...
3307583 3308750 we...
3308791 3311416 we would reverse all our wrongs.
3314500 3316583 Do you think she's okay?
3317666 3319625 Will she be there?
3319666 3320916 Go to sleep.
3323416 3325416 I'll keep you company tonight.
3454916 3456458 Excuse me.
3457583 3459416 Do you have any toilet paper?
3495583 3497166 Can I poo first?
3497208 3498250 I'm sorry.
3570583 3572000 What's bothering you?
3587041 3588291 What's wrong?
3600458 3601250 What is it?
3655625 3657708 Is it around here?
3668750 3669916 Excuse me.
3670291 3671708 Do you know where this is?
3676250 3678458 Mom, where is this house?
3713541 3714666 Ma'am.
3728083 3729333 Excuse me...
3729375 3731333 Is this Natre's house?
3732916 3734333 What do you want?
3735458 3736458 Well...
3736916 3739291 We're her friends.
3740416 3742916 Natre's friends? Come inside.
3753833 3756541 Have some water. You must be tired.
3756791 3758791 Did you drive from Bangkok?
3759833 3761000 Yes.
3765625 3768041 We'd like to ask about Natre.
3769500 3771000 She's not feeling well.
3771375 3773291 She's taking a nap.
3774416 3776125 Should I wake her?
3780416 3782250 Stay for dinner.
3782958 3784333 I was about to cook.
3784583 3787166 I'm making her favorite dish.
3788750 3790708 Natre will be so happy.
3790750 3793000 Her friends don't visit often.
3793333 3795000 Wait right here.
3814666 3816041 Where are you going?
3894000 3895458 How dare you?
3901375 3903541 Did she commit suicide?
3908458 3910791 We should cremate her.
3912958 3914041 No.
3914083 3915875 I won't cremate her.
3917916 3919125 Ma'am...
3920500 3923750 I don't know if you believe such things...
3924041 3927541 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3928458 3932208 They were taken around campus.
3934291 3937166 Some of the places...
3937666 3940583 were rooms Natre had been in.
3943000 3946125 And these shadows appeared.
3949083 3950500 I think that...
3951708 3955208 Natre's spirit is restless.
3956666 3957833 Natre...
3961625 3963250 My dear Natre.
3965625 3967666 Why don't you visit me?
3976458 3979166 Can you tell me what happened?
3979708 3981625 Why she left Bangkok?
3990375 3991541 Ma'am...
3993958 3995000 Ma'am.
3996666 3998541 These shadows...
3998875 4002666 might mean her spirit is not at peace.
4007000 4009666 We should hold her funeral.
4010958 4012000 Please.
4026958 4028625 When she came home...
4028666 4030125 she seemed different.
4030458 4032458 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
4032791 4035333 No one knows what happened in Bangkok.
4036833 4039416 Then she overdosed on pills.
4040000 4042750 Luckily, her mother found her...
4042791 4045041 and got her to the hospital on time.
4045333 4047875 When she recovered...
4049041 4052250 she climbed on the hospital roof...
4052750 4054625 and jumped off the edge.
4056416 4059666 Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?
4061625 4065291 She's been distraught ever since Natre's death.
4065875 4069416 No matter what she refused to cremate her.
4070958 4073333 All the villagers were scared.
4073666 4076791 No one wanted to socialize with her.
4204291 4205708 Can't sleep?
4211625 4213958 Tell me the truth...
4214750 4216583 Did you love Natre?
4220666 4222541 I tried to...
4228875 4231791 I believed that one day I would.
4237375 4239708 But I was fooling myself.
4247666 4249541 When I broke it off...
4250500 4253333 I was a total asshole.
4259416 4261750 But she still loved me the same.
4268291 4270250 I want this to be over.
4272333 4274583 If she wants me to die I will.
4275958 4277666 Don't say that.
4278666 4280583 It's almost over.
4281791 4283208 No it's not.
4288458 4290833 I know she'll come for me.
4291666 4292875 Tun.
4293625 4295791 We've come this far.
4298208 4300208 And you're sorry for what you did.
4300916 4302666 I'm sure she knows.
4304958 4307291 Don't talk about death anymore.
4314250 4315416 I'm sorry.
4321416 4323541 Do you still love me?
4329416 4332000 No matter what you won't leave me, right?
4435833 4436750 Jane.
4437083 4438083 Jane.
4535000 4536125 Tun...
4536666 4537666 Jane...
4538125 4539916 Where did you go?
4541166 4542458 Why did you leave me alone?
4543541 4545291 We've got to leave.
4548541 4550000 Asshole!
4551291 4552958 Why did you leave me?
4553208 4554916 Didn't you love me?
4555375 4556833 How could you leave me?
4559916 4562500 How could you leave me?
4665375 4666375 Tun...
4667041 4668750 Are you feeling better?
4671208 4673166 What happened last night?
4674625 4675708 Tun...
4677458 4678500 Jane...
4678833 4680041 Jane...
4687333 4688708 The abbot said...
4688750 4691041 Natre will be cremated today.
4694500 4696083 It's over.
4816708 4818750 Hello. / Hello, Jane.
4819000 4820583 Picking up photos?
4820875 4822083 Where's Tun?
4822125 4823333 He's busy.
4823791 4824833 Good.
4825166 4826500 When he's busy...
4826541 4827958 I get to see you.
4835625 4837958 You went on vacation?
4838541 4840166 To the beach.
4840208 4841708 When did you go?
4842250 4844000 Last week.
4847208 4848916 This photo is...
4851916 4853291 What's wrong?
4859458 4860583 You look fatter.
4863125 4865250 I didn't recognize you.
4867375 4868500 Hi.
4869541 4870625 Jumbo prints.
4872375 4873625 Write your name, please.
5039791 5041166 Get her guys!
5078375 5079375 Jane...
5080375 5081958 Why are you crying?
5084750 5085750 Asshole...
5088625 5090250 How could you be so cruel?
5096583 5097875 Where did you find these?
5100541 5102375 If I didn't find them...
5102625 5105208 I'd be a fool forever, right?
5110750 5112583 Let me explain.
5115833 5117833 What's there to say?
5122000 5124083 I always believed you.
5131000 5133166 I thought I knew you.
5147666 5148875 Tun.
5150041 5151333 Take her picture...
5151375 5152666 so she doesn't blab.
5153125 5155083 Tun, help me.
5156708 5158250 I know it was wrong.
5159750 5161666 Take her picture now!
5162750 5164000 What's wrong!
5165666 5167208 I'm your buddy!
5167666 5168916 Hurry!
5177666 5179875 Tun, help me.
5193708 5195500 I never forgave myself.
5195750 5197500 But I was young and stupid.
5199041 5200583 I've heard enough.
5202500 5204458 I'm going home.
5261250 5262666 Come on out!
5267541 5268833 Where are you?
5275916 5277750 I thought you loved me!
5280083 5282041 Loved me so much!
5289583 5291833 Till death do us part!
5297291 5298958 She's gone now.
5402666 5403750 Sometimes...
5403791 5405873 spirits long for their loved ones.
