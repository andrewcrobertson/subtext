199958 202958 Cheers!
211083 212333 Excellent.
212875 215541 Let's drink until we drop.
215750 217500 -You should save your energy for tonight.<br />-Mix it.
217666 220250 Are you kidding me, Tun?<br />Don't you know who I am?
221041 223250 Alcohol energizes me.
223708 226208 The later it gets, the hornier I become.
226625 227583 -Horny?<br />-Come, come.
227958 230541 -Let's toast.<br />-Here's another glass. Have a little sip.
233666 235458 So, tell me, Jane.
236208 237250 What year are you in?
237958 238833 I'm in my fourth year.
238916 240958 You're old enough to do what you want now.
241375 243958 So, how did you meet Tun?
244333 245541 Because he's a hunk.
246583 248625 You keep saying that since college.
248958 251791 Jim had to ask for her number for you,
251875 255958 -you pain in the ass.<br />-Speaking of college, do you remember
256333 257583 when you got your heart broken?
257666 260916 -He was so drunk.<br />-Which girl left him a drunken mess?
261000 263458 -Her name was Kay. I do remember that.<br />-It's "Teochew" Kay.
263541 266208 -Ignore them.<br />-Right. What do you mean by "ignore them"?
266833 269375 -Wait. I have a question.<br />-What?
269458 271000 How can a guy like you get married?
271083 272958 Why can't a guy like me get married?
273750 276375 After a long tiring day at work,
276875 278375 all I want is to head home
278791 281208 to cuddle with my wife or my dog,
281291 282958 not waste my life,
283541 288208 -partying with you losers, okay?<br />-I have nothing to do with this, man.
288291 289625 A good man...
289958 292583 went whoring with me last night.
294541 295750 Fooling around so soon?
297208 298458 Here she comes.
301208 302166 Quiet.
302291 303791 What's so funny?
305125 306416 Nothing, dear.
306750 308958 I have one last thing to say to you.
309666 311416 One more glass!
331416 333083 What are we listening to?
335125 336958 Hey. Don't turn it off.
337041 338250 It's beautiful.
340958 342625 You guys seem tight.
342875 344875 How long has it been<br />since you last saw each other?
348583 349750 What are you looking at?
350750 351916 Someone beautiful.
354458 356041 That's so sappy.
399916 400916 Are you okay?
403125 403958 Tun.
405291 406458 Is she dead?
415750 416666 Jane, wait!
426958 427875 Just drive away.
429208 430375 I said drive away!
431958 433125 Drive away!
444125 445750 Get closer, please.
446333 447500 Okay.
448500 449916 Big smile, Nuch.
450666 452291 Or you won't look pretty.
460750 462750 All Science graduates,
462833 464875 please gather on the stand<br />for a class photo.
465500 466833 They're calling you.
467666 469041 Where's Jane?
470583 473083 She's probably taking photos<br />with her friends.
474125 476708 I thought you guys broke up.
477416 479083 Come on. Let's go.
536625 538791 I called you so many times today<br />but you didn't pick up.
539250 540625 Was your phone on silent?
540708 541583 No, it wasn't.
549791 551666 Nuch asked about you today.
554666 557041 When will you be free?
557125 558958 She said she wants to...
581333 582166 Jane.
584416 586250 How can you act like this?
590000 592041 You're pretending like nothing happened.
594375 595708 Since that night,
595791 597166 I haven't been able to sleep at all.
599916 601500 Well...
601583 603500 You think it doesn't bother me?
605500 607958 We should have gone out<br />and checked how she was.
610041 611916 It was an accident, Jane.
613500 615083 That's easy for you to say.
616708 618791 You were not the one behind the wheel.
631208 632875 -Hi, Ti.<br />-Hey.
633208 634958 How's business?<br />Have you got a lot of customers?
635666 637500 With you here this early,
638083 640041 I don't think<br />many customers will be coming.
641916 643416 Are my prints ready?
644541 646500 Yes. Just a second.
651708 652541 Here.
676958 678291 Is your processor broken?
679875 680833 Let me see.
686416 687250 You punk.
687458 689125 If the prints turn out nice,<br />you get the credit.
689750 691625 If they suck, it's my fault.
692291 693666 Just look at the negatives.
694583 696041 This is impossible.
696125 697791 I took them. I should know.
697875 698875 We'll see.
701166 702250 See?
703750 705541 It's your fault your negatives are ruined.
729750 730583 Tun.
741750 742583 Tun.
760625 761541 Tun.
763958 765041 Can you hear me?
894250 895208 Help!
896666 898083 Help!
932416 934583 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
955583 957041 What's wrong with your camera?
958458 959333 I don't know.
959625 961166 The whole roll is ruined.
963958 965583 That many?
971708 973125 What are these shadows?
974083 976041 My camera must be broken.
978125 980166 I don't know how I'm going to tell Nuch.
984166 985125 Tun.
987083 988500 Look at this picture.
999958 1001166 That woman...
1002500 1003958 Do you think she's dead?
1004666 1006000 That's enough, Jane.
1011333 1014166 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
1078708 1079625 Tun.
1079708 1080833 Look at this picture.
1105958 1107625 Are you sure it was here?
1115291 1116166 Excuse me.
1116291 1117416 What happened?
1119000 1121458 A few days ago,<br />a car ran into the billboard.
1121541 1122958 The driver must have been drunk.
1125125 1127041 Was anyone hurt?
1128250 1129250 No.
1130041 1131250 Just the broken sign.
1131375 1132708 Are you sure?
1133250 1134291 What?
1134458 1135625 Well...
1136041 1137250 Nothing, bro.
1138708 1139791 Thank you.
1141916 1142875 What?
1145333 1147875 Are you sure you checked everywhere?
1151458 1152291 It's nothing.
1153333 1154791 Thanks, anyway.
1159708 1162041 My friend called every police station<br />and hospital around the area.
1163708 1167166 He said there was no report<br />of any accidents that night.
1167833 1169375 How is that possible?
1170458 1172291 What about the girl we ran over?
1173958 1176375 Are you sure he called everywhere?
1176708 1178625 Maybe someone helped her.
1179458 1181000 Maybe she's fine.
1181083 1182791 How can she be fine?
1182875 1184875 We plowed into her like that.
1187750 1189791 And even if she's fine...
1191291 1193000 then what's in those photos?
1193625 1196250 I told you they're not related to her.
1196791 1198208 They're just bad exposures.
1198291 1199333 Don't you get it?
1263625 1264458 Tun.
1265333 1267000 I think you need to make merit, man.
1268416 1269500 These pictures...
1270166 1272583 show that there's a spirit haunting you.
1278916 1281583 How long have you been<br />a photographer, you punk?
1281666 1283458 Why are you showing me these?
1283625 1284791 I know, but...
1285291 1287833 Don't you find these shadows strange?
1289958 1291666 You want to see spirits?
1292375 1293750 I'll show you something.
1302041 1302875 Here.
1303666 1304791 This is Auntie Cham's spirit.
1305791 1307208 Do you know where she is now?
1310250 1313125 She's still selling fried bananas<br />in the next alley.
1314875 1316500 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1317166 1318208 Those are all Auntie Cham.
1318666 1320083 They were all taken on the same day.
1320333 1322166 They're just double exposures,
1322250 1323458 and out of focus.
1324375 1327541 Come on. I know that.
1335791 1338250 Everyone is probably familiar<br />with this place.
1339625 1342125 It's just an ordinary location...
1343458 1344750 that we pass by...
1345583 1347333 and see every day.
1353166 1355000 Now look at these pictures.
1359125 1362125 These are pictures of the same location.
1362916 1364041 But do you see...
1365416 1367125 that everything looks better?
1369416 1372458 That means photography
1372875 1375208 does not always convey reality.
1377916 1379416 It depends on how...
1380416 1383125 the image is framed,
1383833 1385333 what the photographer chooses to reveal,
1385708 1387166 and what to conceal.
1388708 1391166 Your perspective is critical.
1404458 1407583 SPECIAL SCOOP: SPIRIT PICTURES
1419666 1421250 Hey, Jane. You're early.
1423291 1425083 I'll get it.
1430583 1432291 -Hello?<br />-Hello, Tun.
1432375 1434666 It's me, Jane.<br />I'll come by in the afternoon.
1435916 1436833 Hello?
1436958 1439166 Tun, can you hear me?
1439791 1440750 Hello?
1440916 1441875 Tun!
1442416 1443375 Tun!
1443666 1444708 Hello?
1445875 1446833 Hello?
1475750 1477083 What's wrong?
1477958 1478958 I don't know.
1479125 1481500 My neck has been hurting<br />since the accident.
1482416 1484208 You should go see a doctor.
1485958 1487416 I'm sure it's nothing serious.
1491041 1492750 What's the use of talking to these quacks?
1494208 1497500 REAL GHOSTS, DEADLY SPIRIT,<br />GHOST STORIES, GHOST PATH
1499791 1501041 Are you a reporter?
1501333 1502250 No.
1503708 1506125 The funeral foundation told us<br />to come here.
1508625 1510750 We run a legal operation here.
1511333 1512791 We have all the permits.
1562291 1563583 Excuse me.
1563958 1566583 Are all these pictures fake?
1567958 1570416 Piak. Go tell our boss he has guests.
1573583 1574750 Everyone fakes them.
1576458 1577291 You know,
1577708 1579666 those photos are always a hit.
1581083 1582833 Any issues with them sell out.
1584208 1585041 Do you think...
1585625 1587541 we can always find real ones?
1589166 1591833 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1593541 1595250 Our readers...
1596041 1597791 want to see scary photos.
1599416 1601125 They don't want love stories.
1602875 1606416 Does that mean<br />all the published photos are fake?
1609625 1611083 I didn't say that.
1625583 1626458 Take a look.
1627666 1628666 Do you see anything?
1629875 1632166 This is the first photo I had.
1633500 1634875 I took it at home.
1636916 1638166 People say the shadow in the back
1638375 1640666 bears an uncanny resemblance to my mom.
1644416 1646208 Believe what you will.
1648458 1649583 But this picture...
1650625 1653000 was taken years after my mom passed away.
1655583 1656583 You know,
1657166 1658125 sometimes
1658458 1660875 spirits just want to be close<br />to their loved ones.
1667541 1668958 The pictures that you see,
1669875 1671083 for me,
1672416 1673791 are more than just...
1674541 1676583 pictures with strange shadows in them.
1679000 1680875 It's the stories behind the pictures.
1686041 1687208 Think about it.
1688750 1690125 Why would the dead...
1691208 1692583 return to the living...
1696333 1699083 if they are not trying<br />to tell us something?
1703750 1704833 Most importantly,
1706166 1707416 people also believe
1708708 1709875 that there are connections...
1710958 1713458 between the shadows<br />and someone in the picture.
1717750 1718958 A father.
1719625 1720541 A mother.
1721125 1722375 A lover.
1724666 1725791 Or it could be someone
1725875 1727958 whom you've wronged in the past.
1752291 1755000 How can we be sure<br />those photos aren't just bad exposures
1755166 1756333 or were forged?
1757166 1759708 What do you think about polaroids?
1763750 1764791 Can you forge them?
1765958 1768083 You load the film cartridge in,<br />press the shutter.
1768666 1770125 And out comes the photo.
1788666 1790041 Tell me, then.
1791291 1792791 How can they be faked?
1797416 1799875 How do we know what they want?
1800833 1803666 Perhaps the answer is in the photo.
1814708 1816583 Here's the last two shots.
1817625 1818875 Big smiles.
1822458 1825541 Can you change your pose for me?
1826125 1829166 Embrace her, hold the bouquet
1829250 1831416 and put your cheeks close together.
1832958 1833958 Good.
1834041 1835166 Beautiful.
1837041 1838916 We're done. Thank you.
1839000 1841791 Thank you to you both.
1842250 1844500 Take them to the dressing room.
1870750 1872208 What the hell?
1874000 1875416 Who's doing that?
1876166 1877583 Aum, check the fuse!
1879666 1880666 Hey, Aum!
1886500 1887583 Who's doing that?
1889083 1891083 Is it you, Aum?
1897583 1898416 Who is it?
1901625 1903041 Who's there?
1905208 1906458 I said, who's there?
1917416 1919791 Where are you, Aum?
1924291 1925166 Who's there?
1977208 1978500 Please step off the scale.
1982666 1984250 Step on it again.
1992458 1993833 Have you been working hard lately?
1994166 1995833 Well, not really.
1996541 1997916 How long has it been hurting?
1998875 2000666 For quite awhile.
2000750 2003083 But it's gotten worse lately.
2004333 2005875 I had a car accident.
2006333 2007583 A car accident?
2008458 2010583 I've done the examination<br />and everything seems fine.
2011583 2013041 You shouldn't worry.
2013791 2016666 But it really hurts, doctor.
2017625 2019958 Your x-rays came back normal.
2020583 2021875 It might be a muscle strain.
2022458 2024791 Try taking the medicine I prescribed.
2025833 2027916 Mr. Tun, your prescription's ready.
2032166 2036375 Take this medicine<br />three times a day after meals
2036666 2038791 until the prescription runs out.
2040958 2042250 Lying bastard.
2043750 2044666 Pardon?
2044750 2045583 Yes?
2047000 2048458 Nothing.
2053458 2055166 Lying bastard.
2056833 2058375 Lying bastard.
2059541 2061958 As for this medicine, the doctor said...
2062250 2063708 Sir!
2064041 2065791 What's wrong?
2068833 2070750 ...is rarely seen.
2071125 2073833 When grasshoppers begin mating,
2074041 2077416 the male can smell the female
2078208 2081958 from a distance up to 100 meters.
2082708 2086416 Then, the male will carefully approach<br />the female
2087291 2090875 and hook itself onto her belly.
2091208 2093208 And they will then begin to mate.
2094708 2098458 The female's response<br />to this is surprising.
2099833 2103333 The male will become her prey.
2103916 2107625 She will slowly eat his head off
2108666 2110916 while they are mating.
2112708 2116750 Eventually, the male succumbs to death.
2125583 2129708 -Excuse me, where is room 301?<br />-It's upstairs.
2135625 2136500 Jane.
2140791 2141916 Jane.
2152208 2153083 Jane.
2225333 2226375 Who's there?
2256541 2257416 Ton.
2258625 2259750 What's wrong?
2263500 2266000 Tun, I'm about to die.
2266750 2268166 What's going on?
2269208 2270166 The photos...
2271666 2273166 Bring me those photos.
2274166 2275375 What photos?
2275583 2276541 Are you drunk?
2278583 2279791 Those photos...
2280500 2281500 Where did you hide them?
2282125 2283208 Give them to me.
2285583 2286708 Do you remember that bitch?
2287166 2288291 Calm down, man.
2289541 2290541 What photos?
2290625 2292166 Just give them to me!
2292416 2294583 Calm down, man!
2295625 2297041 Ton, calm down.
2297541 2299166 What photos?
2304583 2305458 Ton.
2305875 2307375 I'll call your wife.
2352166 2353208 What are you doing?
2355333 2356708 I'm just tidying up the place.
2363125 2364250 Is your neck still sore?
2366958 2367791 Yes.
2367875 2370166 Take it easy. Don't work too hard.

2666375 2667291 Ton.
2668625 2669916 It's me, Tun.
2671875 2672916 Are you home?
2688083 2689125 Ton.
2691541 2692750 Are you home?

2779625 2780500 Ton!
2781916 2782875 Ton!
2784958 2785916 Ton!
2793583 2794875 Ton!
2833250 2834541 I'm really sorry.
2836041 2837083 You know, right?
2837416 2838833 You know what was bothering him.
2843291 2845000 I don't know. Suddenly he...
2845083 2847166 It's all because of you guys, right?
2849750 2851500 Have you all gone insane?
2853000 2854666 What do you mean?
2855791 2857833 Why did everyone commit suicide?
2859291 2860291 Who?
2861958 2863166 Didn't you know?
2864041 2865500 The other two
2865875 2867875 just jumped off the building<br />and killed themselves.
2868833 2869958 Which two?
2873500 2877291 The ones who sat next to you<br />at the wedding.
2923666 2925041 Who is this woman?
2929708 2931000 Where did you get that?
2932375 2934583 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2936291 2937625 Who is she?
2940666 2942375 How is she related to you?
2961916 2963500 I knew her in college.
2967125 2968333 Her name is Net.
2972291 2974208 She was a quiet person.
2976208 2977333 She didn't have any friends.
2981791 2983958 Everyone saw her as a freak.
2989125 2990750 I felt sorry for her.
2998500 3000583 We dated but I kept it a secret.
3004500 3005916 She loved me a lot.
3184250 3186291 She threatened to kill herself.
3187875 3189416 I didn't know what to do.
3189916 3191833 All my friends saw it as a joke.
3192166 3194083 How were they involved?
3194458 3195958 Why are they dead?
3196541 3197375 They...
3197791 3199083 What did they do?
3201583 3202750 I don't know.
3204666 3206916 Ton said he would take care of it.
3210791 3212666 After that, Net disappeared.
3214416 3216666 I never saw her again.
3217708 3219833 Didn't you try to stop them?
3222041 3224208 How could you let it happen?
3231750 3233500 What could I do?
3235916 3237583 Now everyone is dead.
3241500 3242625 I am...
3243458 3245375 I'm probably next.
3285291 3286541 It's funny.
3289125 3291250 We always say...
3292083 3294041 if we could turn back time,
3295625 3296708 we...
3296833 3299291 we wouldn't repeat our mistakes again.
3302541 3304291 Do you think she's okay?
3305708 3307375 Will we see her tomorrow?
3307791 3308833 Go to sleep.
3311458 3313333 I'll keep you company tonight.
3443041 3443958 Excuse me.
3445541 3447083 Do you have any toilet paper?
3483625 3485166 Would you mind letting me shit first?
3485250 3486250 I'm sorry.
3558625 3560125 What's going on, Tun?
3575083 3576416 Tun, what's wrong?
3588500 3589750 What is it?
3643666 3645166 Is it around here?
3656916 3657875 Excuse me.
3658375 3659666 Do you know where this house is?
3664375 3666000 Mom, do you know this house?
3701625 3702708 Ma'am.
3716250 3717458 Excuse me.
3717541 3719083 Is this Net's house?
3721083 3722333 What do you want?
3723583 3724583 Well...
3725041 3727250 We're her friends.
3728541 3730625 Net's friends? Come inside.
3742041 3744500 Have some water. You must be tired.
3744833 3746541 Did you drive here from Bangkok?
3747958 3749125 Yes.
3752166 3753208 Well...
3753750 3756041 We'd like to ask you about Net.
3757625 3759083 She's not feeling well.
3759166 3760916 She's taking a nap after taking her pills.
3762625 3764250 Should I wake her?
3768541 3770041 Stay for dinner.
3771000 3772375 I was about to cook.
3772541 3775208 I'm making Kang Som, Net's favorite dish.
3776875 3778333 Net will be so happy.
3778875 3780833 Her friends don't visit often.
3781458 3782875 Wait right here.
3802666 3803958 What are you doing, Tun?
3881791 3882958 What are you doing?
3889250 3891250 Did she commit suicide?
3896458 3898750 We should hold a funeral for her.
3901000 3902041 No.
3902125 3903708 I won't cremate my own daughter.
3906041 3907250 Ma'am.
3908625 3911708 I don't know if you believe such things,
3912083 3915541 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3916500 3920041 They were taken around campus.
3922333 3925041 Some of the places...
3925708 3928500 were rooms Net had been in.
3929625 3930625 And...
3931125 3933833 And those shadows appeared.
3937125 3938375 I think that...
3939750 3943166 Net's spirit is restless.
3944708 3946041 Net.
3949750 3951166 My dear Net.
3953750 3955500 Why don't you come visit me?
3964666 3966958 You know what happened to her, right?
3967916 3969666 And what happened in Bangkok.
3978583 3979666 Ma'am...
3982166 3983208 Ma'am.
3984791 3986625 The reason Net's spirit is still here
3987000 3990416 might be because<br />her spirit is not at peace.
3995125 3997291 We should hold a funeral for her.
3999083 4000083 Please.
4015083 4016541 Ever since Net came home,
4016625 4018250 she seemed different.
4018416 4020333 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
4020583 4023125 No one knew what happened in Bangkok.
4025041 4027333 One day, she overdosed on pills.
4028041 4030583 Luckily, her mother found her
4030833 4033041 and got her to the hospital in time.
4033375 4035875 After she fully recovered,
4037000 4040125 she climbed on the hospital roof
4041041 4042458 and jumped off the edge.
4044541 4047291 Why did Net's mom still kept<br />her body around?
4049750 4053500 She went a little crazy after Net's death.
4054000 4057500 No matter what anyone said,<br />she refused to cremate her.
4059000 4061041 The villagers got scared.
4061666 4064541 No one wanted to socialize with her.
4192583 4193833 Can't sleep?
4199875 4201666 Tell me the truth, Tun.
4203041 4204500 Did you love Net?
4208875 4210416 I tried to, Jane.
4217291 4219500 I believed that one day I would.
4225500 4227583 But I was fooling myself.
4235958 4237625 When I broke it off,
4238625 4241291 I was a total asshole to her.
4247541 4249625 But she still loved me.
4256416 4258208 I just want this to be over.
4260458 4262791 If she wants me to die, I will.
4264083 4265625 Don't say that.
4266791 4268458 It's almost over.
4269916 4271125 No, it's not.
4276583 4278750 I know she'll come for me.
4279791 4280833 Tun.
4281750 4283625 We've come this far.
4286166 4287958 And you're sorry for what you did.
4289041 4290416 I'm sure she knows.
4293083 4294666 Don't talk like that anymore.
4302625 4303500 I'm sorry.
4309833 4311333 Do you still love me?
4317791 4320291 You won't leave me no matter what, right?
4424208 4425125 Jane.
4425208 4426208 Jane.
4523333 4524333 Tun.
4524875 4525791 Jane.
4526416 4527916 Where were you?
4529458 4531083 Why did you leave me alone?
4531916 4533125 We've got to go, Jane.
4536833 4537875 Asshole!
4539541 4541166 Why did you leave me?
4541541 4543208 Don't you love me anymore?
4543416 4545125 Where are you going?
4548208 4550375 Where are you going?
4653625 4654916 Tun.
4655458 4656625 How are you feeling?
4659500 4661166 What happened last night?
4663000 4663833 Tun.
4665583 4666625 Jane.
4666958 4668166 Jane.
4675625 4678625 The abbot said Net's body<br />will be cremated today.
4682958 4683958 It's over.
4805000 4806875 -Hello.<br />-Hello, Jane.
4807291 4808708 You're here to pick up the photos?
4809166 4810041 Where's Tun?
4810416 4811583 He's busy.
4812083 4813125 Good.
4813541 4816125 I hope he gets busy often,<br />so I can see you instead.
4823666 4825791 You guys went on vacation?
4826750 4828291 We went to Hua Hin.
4828375 4829708 When did you go?
4830375 4831958 Last week.
4835500 4836791 This photo is...
4840125 4841125 What's wrong?
4847500 4848875 Are you getting fatter?
4851500 4853166 I almost didn't recognize you.
4855500 4856666 Hi.
4857666 4859458 -Jumbo prints, please.<br />-Okay.
4860500 4861750 Write your name here, please.
5028083 5029291 Get her!
5066416 5067500 Jane.
5068500 5070083 Why are you crying?
5072875 5073875 Asshole.
5076750 5078416 How could you be so cruel?
5083916 5086000 Jane, where did you find these?
5087958 5090458 -Jane.<br />-If I didn't find them,
5090666 5093083 I'd be a fool forever, right?
5098875 5100375 Let me explain, Jane.
5103791 5105583 What is there to say?
5110125 5111750 I've always believed you.
5119125 5121041 It turns out I don't know you at all.
5135625 5136750 Tun.
5138083 5140791 Take her pictures, so she doesn't blab.
5141166 5143083 Tun, help me!
5144750 5146000 I know it was wrong.
5147833 5149750 Take her pictures now!
5150875 5151958 What's wrong?
5153708 5155166 I'm your buddy!
5155791 5156916 Hurry!
5165708 5167625 Tun, help me!
5181833 5183708 I never forgave myself.
5183833 5185625 But I was young and stupid.
5187000 5188416 Stop talking.
5190500 5191916 I want to go home.
5249375 5250500 Come out.
5255583 5256666 Where are you?
5264041 5265583 Didn't you say you love me?
5268208 5269625 Didn't you love me so much?
5277625 5279666 Till death do us part, huh?
5285333 5286750 Jane's gone now!
5390666 5394625 Sometimes, spirits just want to be close<br />to their loved ones.
