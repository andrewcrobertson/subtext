191791 194487 Cheers!
202402 203801 Excellent.
204370 206600 Let's drink until we drop.
206906 208533 Save something for your wife.
208775 211505 Are you kidding?
211878 214210 Alcohol revives me.
214414 216974 The later it gets, the hornier I get.
217316 220945 Another glass. A little sip.
224190 225953 Tell me, Jane...
226492 227789 What year are you in?
228161 228820 4th year.
229028 231223 A senior should know better.
231464 233898 What are you doing with Tun?
234333 235561 He's a hunk.
235802 238270 You keep saying that.
238504 241132 Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.
241374 242102 Then breaking their hearts.
242341 245674 Speaking of broken hearts...
245878 247277 Remember the time...
247480 250711 that girl left him a drunken mess.
251050 252017 Her name was Kay.
252251 253912 Ignore them.
255888 257981 Wait. I have a question.
258291 260156 How can a guy like you get married?
260359 261792 What's wrong with me?
262495 265055 After a long tiring day...
265431 266989 I want to head home...
267333 269631 to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.
269836 271303 Not waste my life...
271871 273930 partying with you losers.
274173 275800 Not with me.
276709 277801 A good man...
278244 280576 who went whoring with me last night.
282148 283809 Fooling around so soon?
285218 286480 Here she comes.
289021 289680 Quiet.
289889 290947 What's so funny?
292692 293681 Nothing.
294126 296390 One last thing...
297129 299029 One more glass!
318084 319381 What are we listening to?
321687 322881 Don't turn it off.
323089 324420 It's beautiful.
327093 328788 You guys seem tight.
329028 330620 Do you meet often?
334400 335526 What are you looking at?
336335 337700 Beautiful you.
340072 341300 What a sap.
383416 384883 Are you hurt?
386619 387881 Tun...
388821 390345 Is she dead?
398698 400063 Wait!
409609 410803 Drive away.
411477 413104 I said drive away!
414313 415712 Drive away!
425891 427688 Get closer, please.
428294 429261 Okay.
430296 431729 Big smile, Nuch.
432531 433828 Or you won't look pretty.
442141 443665 All Science Majors...
443909 446104 gather for a class photo.
446612 447840 They're calling you.
448881 450007 Where's Jane?
451450 453884 Taking photos with her friends.
455021 457182 I though maybe you broke up.
458090 459682 Come! Let's go.
514847 516940 I phoned but you didn't pick up.
517316 518476 Was it on silent?
527493 529120 Nuch asked about you today.
532498 534261 When will you be free?
534500 536400 She wants to...
557790 558984 Jane.
560726 562387 How can you act like this?
566232 568223 Pretending nothing happened.
570402 571528 Since that night...
571771 573363 I haven't slept soundly.
577309 579004 I'm upset as well.
581080 583412 At least we should have checked.
585317 587478 It was an accident.
588754 590415 That's easy for you to say.
591924 593653 You weren't behind the wheel.
605771 607295 - Hi, Ti.<br />- Hey.
607840 609603 How's business?
609909 611877 With you here this early...
612278 614178 business should be bad.
615915 617712 Are my prints ready?
618651 620380 Yeah. Just a sec.
625291 626349 Here.
649648 650945 Is your processor broken?
652451 653577 Let's see.
658390 659652 The nerve.
659859 661224 Nice prints and you're great.
661427 663861 If they suck, it's my fault.
664230 665629 Let's check the negative.
666599 667827 No way.
668033 669364 I took them. I should know.
669602 670694 We'll see.
673072 674164 See.
675474 677135 Your negative are bad.
700299 701459 Tun.
711710 713109 Tun.
729795 731092 Tun.
733098 734531 Can you hear me?
858323 859620 Help!
860692 862250 Help!
894893 897361 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
917082 918447 What's wrong with your camera?
919785 920752 I don't' know.
920953 922477 The whole roll is ruined.
925124 926819 That many?
932531 934089 What are these shadows?
935134 936795 My camera must be broken.
938871 940600 How should I tell Nuch?
944543 945840 Tun...
947312 948711 Look at this picture.
959858 961018 That woman...
962161 963492 Do you think she's dead?
964229 965287 That's enough.
970602 972900 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
1035300 1036130 Tun...
1036335 1037666 Look at this picture.
1061493 1063051 Are you sure it was here?
1070302 1071200 Excuse me.
1071403 1072370 What happened?
1072804 1076205 A few days ago a car hit the billboard.
1076642 1077870 Must have been drunk.
1079878 1081846 Was anyone hurt?
1082881 1083973 No.
1084516 1085847 Just the broken sign.
1086084 1087381 Are you sure?
1087619 1088483 What?
1089955 1091513 Nothing.
1092824 1094018 Thank you.
1095994 1097086 What?
1099264 1101391 You sure you checked everywhere?
1104903 1106200 Nothing.
1106872 1108100 Thanks anyways.
1112978 1115378 He called every precinct and hospital.
1116982 1120418 No accidents were reported that night.
1120819 1122218 That's not possible.
1123422 1125151 What about the girl we hit?
1126825 1129055 You sure he called every one?
1129328 1131091 Maybe someone helped her.
1131663 1133528 Maybe she's fine.
1133799 1135164 How could she be fine?
1135400 1137163 We ploughed her down.
1140172 1141833 And even if she's fine...
1143442 1145103 Something is in those pictures.
1145577 1148205 I told you they're not related to her.
1148714 1149840 They're just bad exposures.
1150048 1151481 Get it?
1212911 1213935 Tun...
1214613 1216205 You need to make some merit.
1217682 1218842 These pictures...
1219217 1221412 show that a spirit is haunting you.
1227692 1230092 How long have you been a photographer?
1230295 1231922 Why are you showing me these?
1232264 1233162 I know...
1233665 1235792 But don't you find these shadows strange?
1238303 1239600 You want to see spirits?
1240605 1241833 I'll show you some.
1249815 1250543 Here.
1251249 1252375 Auntie Cham's spirit.
1253385 1254682 You know where she is now?
1257689 1260453 She's selling grilled bananas next door.
1262160 1263491 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1264229 1265287 All Auntie Cham.
1265831 1267025 Taken on the same day.
1267399 1268559 They're just double exposures...
1268800 1270267 and out of focus.
1271203 1274001 Come on. I know that.
1282314 1284407 Everyone is familiar with this place.
1285951 1288215 Just an ordinary location...
1289588 1291180 that we pass...
1291790 1293280 and see everyday.
1298830 1300695 Now look at these pictures...
1304603 1307401 taken of the same place.
1308240 1309502 In these...
1310642 1312200 the bridge looks nicer.
1314412 1315674 That means photography...
1316114 1320380 does not reproduce reality.
1322721 1324018 It depends on how...
1325023 1327617 the image is framed.
1328226 1329716 What is revealed.
1330095 1331722 What is concealed.
1332931 1335525 Your perspective is critical.
1346878 1350405 "Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures"
1362894 1364293 Jane, you're early.
1366765 1367993 I'll get it.
1373004 1374665 - Hello?<br />- Hello, Tun.
1374906 1376874 It's Jane. I'll come by later.
1378310 1379004 Hello?
1379244 1381303 Tun, can you hear me?
1381546 1382774 Hello?
1382981 1384243 Tun!
1384482 1385744 Tun!
1386484 1387542 Hello?
1387752 1389276 Hello?
1416648 1417910 What's wrong?
1418717 1419684 I don't' know.
1419884 1421852 My neck's hurt since the accident.
1422921 1424582 You should go see a doctor.
1426491 1427753 I'm sure it's not serious.
1431196 1432823 What's the use of talking to these spoofs?
1434499 1436990 "Real Ghosts"
1439504 1440903 Are you a reporter?
1441172 1442196 No.
1443274 1445742 The funeral foundation sent us.
1447979 1450174 We run a legal operation.
1450482 1452245 We have all the right permits.
1499731 1500789 Excuse me.
1501232 1503530 Are all these pictures fakes?
1505170 1507502 Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.
1510341 1511672 Everyone fakes them.
1513178 1514202 You know...
1514479 1516344 these photos are always a hit.
1517515 1519506 Any issue with them sells out.
1520585 1521552 But you think...
1521986 1523681 we can always find real ones?
1525957 1528118 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1529527 1531222 Our readers...
1531863 1533854 want to see scary photos.
1535200 1536758 They don't want loves stories.
1538503 1541904 Does that mean every photo is fake?
1545009 1546840 I didn't say that.
1560391 1561517 Take a look.
1562494 1563893 See anything?
1564529 1566827 This is the first photo I had.
1568066 1569431 I took it at home.
1571202 1572430 The shadow...
1572704 1575172 bears a likeness to my mom.
1578510 1580205 Believe what you will.
1582313 1583405 But this picture...
1584215 1587048 was taken after she passed away.
1589053 1590452 You know...
1590722 1591711 sometimes...
1591923 1594357 spirits long for their loved ones.
1600598 1601963 In my opinion...
1602834 1604131 these pictures...
1605303 1606770 represent more than...
1607405 1609373 macabre urban legends.
1611609 1613804 They are signs.
1618416 1619713 Think about it.
1621019 1622509 Why would the dead...
1623288 1624880 return to the living...
1628259 1631126 Without a message to convey?
1635433 1636798 Most importantly...
1637702 1639101 I believe...
1640171 1641604 these shadows...
1642340 1644808 are related to someone in the picture.
1649080 1650342 A father...
1650715 1651773 mother...
1652083 1653414 or lover.
1655520 1656782 Or someone...
1656988 1658979 you maligned in life.
1681946 1684608 How can we tell if they're real...
1684816 1686147 and not fakes?
1686517 1687950 What about Polaroid's?
1688152 1689551 Can you fake them?
1692991 1697360 You load the film and press the shutter.
1697795 1699092 The photo ejects.
1716915 1718576 Tell me then...
1719350 1721284 How can they be faked?
1725223 1727817 How do we know what they want?
1728426 1729415 Perhaps...
1729694 1731525 the answer is in the photo.
1742006 1743871 Two more poses.
1744742 1746175 Big smiles.
1750014 1752574 Let's have a different pose.
1753217 1756118 Embrace her, hold the bouquet...
1756321 1758346 and kiss her cheek.
1760725 1761783 Beautiful.
1763361 1765226 We're done.
1765596 1767962 Thank you both.
1768399 1770594 Take them to the dressing room.
1795927 1797258 What the...
1799063 1800325 Who's doing that?
1800898 1802331 Aum, check the fuse!
1804235 1805634 Hey! Aum!
1808773 1809603 Aum!
1810875 1812001 Who's doing that?
1813277 1815245 Is it you, Aum?
1821519 1822679 Who is it?
1825356 1826846 Aum, where are you?
1828893 1830360 Who's there!
1831029 1832291 I asked who it is!
1840371 1841963 Where are you, Aum?
1847211 1848610 Who's there!
1897862 1899454 Please step off the scale.
1903034 1904626 Step on it again.
1912443 1914070 Been working hard lately?
1914312 1915802 Not really.
1916447 1917880 How long has it hurt?
1918850 1920681 For quite awhile.
1920885 1922750 But it's gotten worse lately.
1923221 1925382 I had a car accident.
1925990 1927252 An accident?
1927892 1929757 Physically, you're fine.
1930928 1932259 You shouldn't worry.
1933197 1935688 But it really hurts.
1936901 1939062 Your x-rays are normal.
1939403 1940927 It may be a sprain.
1941272 1943331 Try the medicine I prescribed.
1944642 1946701 Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.
1950681 1951909 Take this medicine...
1952283 1954547 3 times a day after meals...
1954819 1957049 until the prescription runs out.
1959090 1960284 Lying bastard.
1961492 1962288 Pardon?
1962493 1963551 Yes?
1964896 1966386 Nothing.
1971035 1972696 Lying bastard.
1974405 1975702 Lying bastard.
1976841 1978308 As for this medicine...
1980244 1980903 Sir!
1981145 1983010 What's wrong?
1986017 1987575 ...is rarely seen.
1988085 1990519 When grasshoppers begin mating...
1991022 1993957 the male smells the female...
1994759 1998354 from a distance up to 100 meters.
1999163 2002758 The male carefully approaches the female.
2003534 2006594 It hooks itself onto her belly.
2007305 2009102 And they begin to mate.
2010708 2014405 The female's response is surprising.
2015580 2018947 The male becomes her prey.
2019584 2023213 She slowly eats off his head...
2023788 2026348 while they are mating.
2028259 2029248 Eventually...
2029460 2031621 the male succumbs to death.
2040304 2043603 Excuse me, where is Room 301?
2049947 2050845 Jane.
2054885 2056318 Jane.
2065763 2067025 Jane.
2135900 2137060 Who's there?
2165730 2166856 Tonn...
2167765 2169130 What's wrong?
2172703 2173670 Tun...
2173871 2175304 I'm going to die.
2175506 2177133 What's going on?
2177808 2178900 The photos...
2180511 2181944 Bring me those photos.
2183013 2184207 What photos?
2184482 2185506 Are you drunk?
2187184 2188515 Those photos...
2188953 2190477 Where did you hide them?
2190721 2192018 Give them to me.
2193724 2195157 Remember that bitch.
2195426 2196415 Calm down.
2197561 2198391 What photos?
2198596 2200223 Just give them to me!
2200598 2202293 Please calm down.
2203501 2204900 Tonn, calm down.
2205703 2207102 What photos?
2212243 2213403 Tonn.
2213611 2215044 I'll call your wife.
2257888 2259116 What are you doing?
2260658 2262182 Cleaning up.
2268265 2269698 Your neck still sore?
2271702 2272862 Yeah.
2273103 2275162 Take it easy. Don't work so much.

2559490 2560650 Tonn.
2561492 2562982 It's Tun.
2564595 2566062 Are you home?
2580210 2581302 Tonn.
2583614 2585104 Are you home?
2593924 2595084 Tonn.
2619783 2621011 "Natrenapa Chan-ngam"
2668131 2669621 Tonn!
2670334 2671426 Tonn!
2673303 2674463 Tonn!
2681411 2682901 Tonn!
2718516 2721280 I'm really sorry.
2722587 2723815 Do you know...
2724055 2725522 What was bothering him?
2729394 2730918 No. Suddenly he...
2731129 2733359 It's your gang's fault.
2735700 2737429 Have you all gone insane?
2738736 2740328 What do you mean?
2741506 2743474 You've all committed suicide.
2744809 2745935 Who?
2747345 2748778 Don't you know?
2749447 2750914 The other two...
2751315 2753340 also killed themselves.
2754052 2755280 Which two?
2758556 2762356 The two who sat next to you.
2806671 2808104 Who's this woman?
2812477 2813876 Where did you get that?
2815146 2817205 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2818850 2820010 Who is she?
2822920 2824888 How is she related to you?
2843241 2845209 I knew her in college.
2848312 2849802 Her name is Natre.
2853384 2855375 She was a quiet person...
2857121 2858486 without any friends.
2862627 2864492 We all thought she was weird.
2869667 2871259 I felt sorry for her.
2878509 2880704 We dated but I kept it secret.
2884248 2885613 She loved me a lot.
3056787 3058482 She threatened to slit her wrists.
3060291 3061918 I didn't know what to do.
3062493 3064188 My friends thought it was funny.
3064695 3066219 How were they involved?
3066764 3068061 Why are they dead?
3068666 3069792 They...
3070000 3071058 What did they do?
3073504 3074732 I don't know.
3076107 3078473 Tonn said he'd take care of it.
3082413 3084108 After that, Natre disappeared.
3085950 3087975 I never saw her again.
3088986 3091079 Didn't you try to stop them?
3093190 3095852 How could you let it happen?
3102400 3103890 What could I do?
3106303 3107930 Now everyone is dead.
3111475 3112703 I'm...
3113677 3115201 I'm going to die next.
3153951 3155248 It's funny how...
3157588 3159488 we always say...
3160424 3162187 if we could turn back time...
3163961 3164893 we...
3165129 3167097 we would reverse all our wrongs.
3170501 3172128 Do you think she's okay?
3173571 3174936 Will she be there?
3175372 3176464 Go to sleep.
3179076 3180566 I'll keep you company tonight.
3305202 3306362 Excuse me.
3307671 3309104 Do you have any toilet paper?
3344108 3345507 Can I poo first?
3345709 3347108 I'm sorry.
3416246 3417474 What's bothering you?
3431328 3432886 Tun. What's wrong?
3445008 3446373 What is it?
3498028 3499290 Is it around here?
3510207 3511504 Excuse me.
3512109 3513371 Do you know where this is?
3517781 3519681 Mom, where is this house?
3553650 3554912 Ma'am.
3567431 3568523 Excuse me...
3568765 3570164 Is this Natre's house?
3572135 3573295 What do you want?
3574605 3575629 Well...
3576006 3578167 We're her friends.
3579142 3581133 Natre's friends? Come inside.
3592222 3594690 Have some water. You must be tired.
3595025 3596617 Did you drive from Bangkok?
3597828 3598852 Yes.
3601965 3605992 We'd like to ask about Natre.
3607037 3608698 She's not feeling well.
3609106 3610403 She's taking a nap.
3611909 3613308 Should I wake her?
3617681 3619273 Stay for dinner.
3620150 3621378 I was about to cook.
3621585 3623951 I'm making her favourite dish.
3625656 3627214 Natre will be so happy.
3627724 3629555 Her friends don't visit often.
3630160 3631559 Wait right here.
3650514 3651776 Where are you going?
3726423 3727720 How dare you?
3733764 3735732 Did she commit suicide?
3740670 3742797 We should cremate her.
3744741 3745708 No.
3745909 3747274 I won't cremate her.
3749713 3750702 Ma'am...
3752349 3755216 I don't know if you believe such things...
3755685 3759052 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3759856 3763189 They were taken around campus.
3765495 3767827 Some of the places...
3768598 3771499 were rooms Natre had been in.
3772335 3776271 And these shadows appeared
3779843 3781071 I think that...
3782312 3785406 Natre's spirit is restless.
3786883 3788111 Natre...
3791755 3793222 My dear Natre.
3795425 3797325 Why don't you visit me?
3805802 3808202 Can you tell me what happened?
3809106 3810767 Why she left Bangkok?
3819282 3820544 Ma'am...
3822786 3823946 Ma'am.
3825322 3826949 These shadows...
3827524 3830857 might mean her spirit is not at peace.
3835198 3837393 We should hold her funeral.
3838935 3840266 Please.
3854451 3855679 When she came home...
3855886 3857319 she seemed different.
3857687 3859450 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
3860023 3862014 No one knows what happened in Bangkok.
3863994 3866155 Then she overdosed on pills.
3866863 3869263 Luckily, her mother found her...
3869633 3871498 and got her to the hospital on time.
3872002 3874266 When she recovered...
3875605 3878472 she climbed on the hospital roof...
3879109 3880633 and jumped off the edge.
3882812 3885576 Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?
3887684 3890915 She's been distraught<br />ever since Natre's death.
3891655 3895318 No matter what she refused to cremate her.
3896660 3898855 All the villagers were scared.
3899229 3902027 No one wanted to socialize with her.
4024754 4025982 Can't sleep?
4031795 4033854 Tell me the truth...
4034831 4036492 Did you love Natre?
4040303 4042032 I tried to...
4048311 4050802 I believed that one day I would.
4056553 4058453 But I was fooling myself.
4066463 4067896 When I broke it off...
4069132 4071566 I was a total asshole.
4077574 4079508 But she still loved me the same.
4086082 4087913 I want this to be over.
4089986 4092420 If she wants me to die I will.
4093490 4095151 Don't say that.
4096159 4097751 It's almost over.
4099129 4100255 No it's not.
4105435 4107699 I know she'll come for me.
4108605 4109663 Tun.
4110573 4112234 We've come this far.
4114577 4116545 And you're sorry for what you did.
4117514 4119072 I'm sure she knows.
4121451 4123078 Don't talk about death anymore.
4130193 4131592 I'm sorry.
4137233 4138996 Do you still love me?
4144941 4147774 No matter what you won't leave me, right?
4246976 4249001 Jane.
4342105 4343402 Tun...
4343773 4344762 Jane...
4345308 4346798 Where did you go?
4348111 4349601 Why did you leave me alone?
4350513 4351605 We've got to leave.
4355218 4356617 Asshole!
4357854 4359321 Why did you leave me?
4359522 4361217 Didn't you love me?
4361658 4362955 How could you leave me?
4366029 4367894 How could you leave me?
4467230 4468424 Tun...
4468798 4470356 Are you feeling better?
4472902 4474893 What happened last night?
4476372 4477430 Tun...
4479108 4480075 Jane...
4480276 4481402 Jane...
4488551 4489483 The abbot said...
4489685 4491653 Natre will be cremated today.
4495291 4496849 It's over.
4612742 4614300 - Hello.<br />- Hello, Jane.
4614911 4615935 Picking up photos?
4616746 4617644 Where's Tun?
4617847 4619075 He's busy.
4619548 4620640 Good.
4620850 4621680 When he's busy...
4621884 4623351 I get to see you.
4631460 4632791 You went on vacation?
4633629 4634687 To the beach.
4635231 4636357 When did you go?
4637066 4638590 Last week.
4640937 4642928 This photo is...
4646442 4647602 What's wrong?
4653783 4655011 You look fatter.
4657386 4658785 I didn't recognize you.
4661290 4662257 Hi.
4663259 4664453 Jumbo prints.
4666162 4667390 Write you name, please.
4826856 4828118 Get her guys!
4863792 4864884 Jane...
4865294 4867023 Why are you crying?
4869932 4871024 Asshole...
4873636 4875604 How could you be so cruel?
4881243 4882676 Where did you find these?
4885281 4886873 If I didn't find them...
4887082 4889312 I'd be a fool forever, right?
4894924 4896414 Let me explain.
4899662 4901357 What's there to say?
4905701 4907293 I always believed you.
4914410 4916344 I thought I knew you.
4930326 4931384 Tun.
4932628 4933754 Take her picture...
4934029 4935223 so she doesn't blab.
4935431 4937422 Tun, help me.
4939101 4940261 I know it was wrong.
4941904 4943701 Take her picture now!
4944873 4945999 What's wrong!
4947543 4949010 I'm your buddy!
4949511 4950535 Hurry!
4959221 4961052 Tun, help me.
4974503 4975800 I never forgave myself.
4976005 4977973 But I was young and stupid.
4979541 4980906 I've heard enough.
4983012 4984502 I'm going home.
5039401 5040732 Come on out!
5045541 5046906 Where are you?
5053449 5055076 I thought you loved me!
5057419 5059114 Loved me so much!
5066595 5068790 Till death do us part!
5073902 5075529 She's gone now.
5174803 5176031 Sometimes...
5176271 5178603 spirits long for their loved ones.
