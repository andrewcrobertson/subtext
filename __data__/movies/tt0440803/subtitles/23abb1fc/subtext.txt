139050 141750 Cheers!
149660 151060 Excellent.
151630 153860 Let's drink until we drop.
154170 155790 Save something for your wife.
156040 158770 Are you kidding?
159140 161470 Alcohol revives me.
161670 164230 The later it gets, the hornier I get.
164580 168210 Another glass. A little sip.
171450 173210 Tell me, Jane...
173750 175050 What year are you in?
175420 176080 4th year.
176290 178480 A senior should know better.
178720 181160 What are you doing with Tun?
181590 182820 He's a hunk.
183060 185530 You keep saying that.
185760 188390 Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.
188630 189360 Then breaking their hearts.
189600 192930 Speaking of broken hearts...
193140 194540 Remember the time...
194740 197970 that girl left him a drunken mess.
198310 199280 Her name was Kay.
199510 201170 Ignore them.
203150 205240 Wait. I have a question.
205550 207420 How can a guy like you get married?
207620 209050 What's wrong with me?
209760 212320 After a long tiring day...
212690 214250 I want to head home...
214590 216890 to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.
217100 218560 Not waste my life...
219130 221190 partying with you losers.
221430 223060 Not with me.
223970 225060 A good man...
225500 227840 who went whoring with me last night.
229410 231070 Fooling around so soon?
232480 233740 Here she comes.
236280 236940 Quiet.
237150 238210 What's so funny?
239950 240940 Nothing.
241390 243650 One last thing...
244390 246290 One more glass!
265340 266640 What are we listening to?
268950 270140 Don't turn it off.
270350 271680 It's beautiful.
274350 276050 You guys seem tight.
276290 277880 Do you meet often?
281660 282790 What are you looking at?
283600 284960 Beautiful you.
287330 288560 What a sap.
330680 332140 Are you hurt?
333880 335140 Tun...
336080 337610 Is she dead?
345960 347320 Wait!
356870 358060 Drive away.
358740 360360 I said drive away!
361570 362970 Drive away!
373150 374950 Get closer, please.
375550 376520 Okay.
377560 378990 Big smile, Nuch.
379790 381090 Or you won't look pretty.
389400 390930 All Science Majors...
391170 393360 gather for a class photo.
393870 395100 They're calling you.
396140 397270 Where's Jane?
398710 401140 Taking photos with her friends.
402280 404440 I though maybe you broke up.
405350 406940 Come! Let's go.
462110 464200 I phoned but you didn't pick up.
464580 465740 Was it on silent?
474750 476380 Nuch asked about you today.
479760 481520 When will you be free?
481760 483660 She wants to...
505050 506240 Jane.
507990 509650 How can you act like this?
513490 515480 Pretending nothing happened.
517660 518790 Since that night...
519030 520620 I haven't slept soundly.
524570 526260 I'm upset as well.
528340 530670 At least we should have checked.
532580 534740 It was an accident.
536010 537680 That's easy for you to say.
539180 540910 You weren't behind the wheel.
553030 554560 - Hi, Ti.<br />- Hey.
555100 556860 How's business?
557170 559140 With you here this early...
559540 561440 business should be bad.
563180 564970 Are my prints ready?
565910 567640 Yeah. Just a sec.
572550 573610 Here.
596910 598210 Is your processor broken?
599710 600840 Let's see.
605650 606910 The nerve.
607120 608480 Nice prints and you're great.
608690 611120 If they suck, it's my fault.
611490 612890 Let's check the negative.
613860 615090 No way.
615290 616620 I took them. I should know.
616860 617950 We'll see.
620330 621420 See.
622730 624400 Your negative are bad.
647560 648720 Tun.
658970 660370 Tun.
677060 678350 Tun.
680360 681790 Can you hear me?
805580 806880 Help!
807950 809510 Help!
842150 844620 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
864340 865710 What's wrong with your camera?
867050 868010 I don't' know.
868210 869740 The whole roll is ruined.
872380 874080 That many?
879790 881350 What are these shadows?
882390 884060 My camera must be broken.
886130 887860 How should I tell Nuch?
891800 893100 Tun...
894570 895970 Look at this picture.
907120 908280 That woman...
909420 910750 Do you think she's dead?
911490 912550 That's enough.
917860 920160 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
982560 983390 Tun...
983600 984930 Look at this picture.
1008750 1010310 Are you sure it was here?
1017560 1018460 Excuse me.
1018660 1019630 What happened?
1020060 1023470 A few days ago a car hit the billboard.
1023900 1025130 Must have been drunk.
1027140 1029110 Was anyone hurt?
1030140 1031230 No.
1031780 1033110 Just the broken sign.
1033340 1034640 Are you sure?
1034880 1035740 What?
1037220 1038770 Nothing.
1040080 1041280 Thank you.
1043250 1044350 What?
1046520 1048650 You sure you checked everywhere?
1052160 1053460 Nothing.
1054130 1055360 Thanks anyways.
1060240 1062640 He called every precinct and hospital.
1064240 1067680 No accidents were reported that night.
1068080 1069480 That's not possible.
1070680 1072410 What about the girl we hit?
1074090 1076320 You sure he called every one?
1076590 1078350 Maybe someone helped her.
1078920 1080790 Maybe she's fine.
1081060 1082420 How could she be fine?
1082660 1084420 We ploughed her down.
1087430 1089090 And even if she's fine...
1090700 1092360 Something is in those pictures.
1092840 1095470 I told you they're not related to her.
1095970 1097100 They're just bad exposures.
1097310 1098740 Get it?
1160170 1161200 Tun...
1161870 1163470 You need to make some merit.
1164940 1166100 These pictures...
1166480 1168670 show that a spirit is haunting you.
1174950 1177350 How long have you been a photographer?
1177560 1179180 Why are you showing me these?
1179520 1180420 I know...
1180930 1183050 But don't you find these shadows strange?
1185560 1186860 You want to see spirits?
1187870 1189090 I'll show you some.
1197080 1197800 Here.
1198510 1199640 Auntie Cham's spirit.
1200650 1201940 You know where she is now?
1204950 1207710 She's selling grilled bananas next door.
1209420 1210750 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1211490 1212550 All Auntie Cham.
1213090 1214290 Taken on the same day.
1214660 1215820 They're just double exposures...
1216060 1217530 and out of focus.
1218460 1221260 Come on. I know that.
1229570 1231670 Everyone is familiar with this place.
1233210 1235480 Just an ordinary location...
1236850 1238440 that we pass...
1239050 1240540 and see everyday.
1246090 1247960 Now look at these pictures...
1251860 1254660 taken of the same place.
1255500 1256760 In these...
1257900 1259460 the bridge looks nicer.
1261670 1262930 That means photography...
1263370 1267640 does not reproduce reality.
1269980 1271280 It depends on how...
1272280 1274880 the image is framed.
1275490 1276980 What is revealed.
1277360 1278980 What is concealed.
1280190 1282790 Your perspective is critical.

1310150 1311550 Jane, you're early.
1314030 1315250 I'll get it.
1320260 1321930 - Hello?<br />- Hello, Tun.
1322170 1324130 It's Jane. I'll come by later.
1325570 1326260 Hello?
1326500 1328560 Tun, can you hear me?
1328810 1330030 Hello?
1330240 1331500 Tun!
1331740 1333000 Tun!
1333740 1334800 Hello?
1335010 1336540 Hello?
1363910 1365170 What's wrong?
1365980 1366940 I don't' know.
1367140 1369110 My neck's hurt since the accident.
1370180 1371840 You should go see a doctor.
1373750 1375010 I'm sure it's not serious.
1378460 1380080 What's the use of talking to these spoofs?
1381760 1384250 "Real Ghosts"
1386760 1388160 Are you a reporter?
1388430 1389460 No.
1390530 1393000 The funeral foundation sent us.
1395240 1397430 We run a legal operation.
1397740 1399510 We have all the right permits.
1446990 1448050 Excuse me.
1448490 1450790 Are all these pictures fakes?
1452430 1454760 Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.
1457600 1458930 Everyone fakes them.
1460440 1461460 You know...
1461740 1463600 these photos are always a hit.
1464780 1466770 Any issue with them sells out.
1467850 1468810 But you think...
1469250 1470940 we can always find real ones?
1473220 1475380 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1476790 1478480 Our readers...
1479120 1481110 want to see scary photos.
1482460 1484020 They don't want loves stories.
1485760 1489160 Does that mean every photo is fake?
1492270 1494100 I didn't say that.
1507650 1508780 Take a look.
1509750 1511150 See anything?
1511790 1514090 This is the first photo I had.
1515330 1516690 I took it at home.
1518460 1519690 The shadow...
1519960 1522430 bears a likeness to my mom.
1525770 1527470 Believe what you will.
1529570 1530670 But this picture...
1531480 1534310 was taken after she passed away.
1536310 1537710 You know...
1537980 1538970 sometimes...
1539180 1541620 spirits long for their loved ones.
1547860 1549220 In my opinion...
1550090 1551390 these pictures...
1552560 1554030 represent more than...
1554670 1556630 macabre urban legends.
1558870 1561060 They are signs.
1565680 1566970 Think about it.
1568280 1569770 Why would the dead...
1570550 1572140 return to the living...
1575520 1578390 Without a message to convey?
1582690 1584060 Most importantly...
1584960 1586360 I believe...
1587430 1588860 these shadows...
1589600 1592070 are related to someone in the picture.
1596340 1597600 A father...
1597980 1599030 mother...
1599340 1600670 or lover.
1602780 1604040 Or someone...
1604250 1606240 you maligned in life.
1629210 1631870 How can we tell if they're real...
1632080 1633410 and not fakes?
1633780 1635210 What about Polaroid's?
1635410 1636810 Can you fake them?
1640250 1644620 You load the film and press the shutter.
1645060 1646350 The photo ejects.
1664180 1665840 Tell me then...
1666610 1668540 How can they be faked?
1672480 1675080 How do we know what they want?
1675690 1676680 Perhaps...
1676950 1678790 the answer is in the photo.
1689270 1691130 Two more poses.
1692000 1693440 Big smiles.
1697270 1699830 Let's have a different pose.
1700480 1703380 Embrace her, hold the bouquet...
1703580 1705610 and kiss her cheek.
1707990 1709040 Beautiful.
1710620 1712490 We're done.
1712860 1715220 Thank you both.
1715660 1717850 Take them to the dressing room.
1743190 1744520 What the...
1746320 1747590 Who's doing that?
1748160 1749590 Aum, check the fuse!
1751500 1752890 Hey! Aum!
1756030 1756860 Aum!
1758140 1759260 Who's doing that?
1760540 1762510 Is it you, Aum?
1768780 1769940 Who is it?
1772620 1774110 Aum, where are you?
1776150 1777620 Who's there!
1778290 1779550 I asked who it is!
1787630 1789220 Where are you, Aum?
1794470 1795870 Who's there!
1845120 1846710 Please step off the scale.
1850290 1851890 Step on it again.
1859700 1861330 Been working hard lately?
1861570 1863060 Not really.
1863710 1865140 How long has it hurt?
1866110 1867940 For quite awhile.
1868150 1870010 But it's gotten worse lately.
1870480 1872640 I had a car accident.
1873250 1874510 An accident?
1875150 1877020 Physically, you're fine.
1878190 1879520 You shouldn't worry.
1880460 1882950 But it really hurts.
1884160 1886320 Your x-rays are normal.
1886660 1888190 It may be a sprain.
1888530 1890590 Try the medicine I prescribed.
1891900 1893960 Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.
1897940 1899170 Take this medicine...
1899540 1901810 3 times a day after meals...
1902080 1904310 until the prescription runs out.
1906350 1907540 Lying bastard.
1908750 1909550 Pardon?
1909750 1910810 Yes?
1912160 1913650 Nothing.
1918300 1919960 Lying bastard.
1921670 1922960 Lying bastard.
1924100 1925570 As for this medicine...
1927500 1928160 Sir!
1928410 1930270 What's wrong?
1933280 1934840 ...is rarely seen.
1935350 1937780 When grasshoppers begin mating...
1938280 1941220 the male smells the female...
1942020 1945610 from a distance up to 100 meters.
1946420 1950020 The male carefully approaches the female.
1950790 1953850 It hooks itself onto her belly.
1954570 1956360 And they begin to mate.
1957970 1961670 The female's response is surprising.
1962840 1966210 The male becomes her prey.
1966840 1970470 She slowly eats off his head...
1971050 1973610 while they are mating.
1975520 1976510 Eventually...
1976720 1978880 the male succumbs to death.
1987560 1990860 Excuse me, where is Room 301?
1997210 1998110 Jane.

2122770 2124390 What's going on?
2125070 2126160 The photos...
2127770 2129200 Bring me those photos.
2130270 2131470 What photos?
2131740 2132770 Are you drunk?
2134440 2135780 Those photos...
2136210 2137740 Where did you hide them?
2137980 2139280 Give them to me.
2140980 2142420 Remember that bitch.
2142690 2143680 Calm down.
2144820 2145650 What photos?
2145860 2147480 Just give them to me!
2147860 2149550 Please calm down.
2150760 2152160 Tonn, calm down.
2152960 2154360 What photos?
2159500 2160660 Tonn.
2160870 2162300 I'll call your wife.
2205150 2206380 What are you doing?
2207920 2209440 Cleaning up.
2215530 2216960 Your neck still sore?

2620560 2621720 Tonn!
2628670 2630160 Tonn!
2665680 2668440 I'm really sorry.
2669750 2670970 Do you know...
2671210 2672680 What was bothering him?
2676550 2678080 No. Suddenly he...
2678290 2680520 It's your gang's fault.
2682860 2684590 Have you all gone insane?
2685900 2687490 What do you mean?
2688670 2690630 You've all committed suicide.
2691970 2693090 Who?
2694500 2695940 Don't you know?
2696610 2698070 The other two...
2698470 2700500 also killed themselves.
2701210 2702440 Which two?
2705720 2709520 The two who sat next to you.
2753830 2755260 Who's this woman?
2759640 2761040 Where did you get that?
2762310 2764360 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2766010 2767170 Who is she?
2770080 2772050 How is she related to you?
2790400 2792370 I knew her in college.
2795470 2796960 Her name is Natre.
2800540 2802530 She was a quiet person...
2804280 2805650 without any friends.
2809790 2811650 We all thought she was weird.
2816830 2818420 I felt sorry for her.
2825670 2827860 We dated but I kept it secret.
2831410 2832770 She loved me a lot.
3003950 3005640 She threatened to slit her wrists.
3007450 3009080 I didn't know what to do.
3009650 3011350 My friends thought it was funny.
3011850 3013380 How were they involved?
3013920 3015220 Why are they dead?
3015830 3016950 They...
3017160 3018220 What did they do?
3020660 3021890 I don't know.
3023270 3025630 Tonn said he'd take care of it.
3029570 3031270 After that, Natre disappeared.
3033110 3035130 I never saw her again.
3036150 3038240 Didn't you try to stop them?
3040350 3043010 How could you let it happen?
3049560 3051050 What could I do?
3053460 3055090 Now everyone is dead.
3058630 3059860 I'm...
3060840 3062360 I'm going to die next.
3101110 3102410 It's funny how...
3104750 3106650 we always say...
3107580 3109350 if we could turn back time...
3111120 3112050 we...
3112290 3114260 we would reverse all our wrongs.
3117660 3119290 Do you think she's okay?
3120730 3122100 Will she be there?
3122530 3123620 Go to sleep.
3126240 3127730 I'll keep you company tonight.
3252360 3253520 Excuse me.
3254830 3256260 Do you have any toilet paper?
3291270 3292670 Can I poo first?
3292870 3294270 I'm sorry.
3363410 3364630 What's bothering you?
3378490 3380050 Tun. What's wrong?
3392170 3393530 What is it?
3445190 3446450 Is it around here?
3457370 3458660 Excuse me.
3459270 3460530 Do you know where this is?
3464940 3466840 Mom, where is this house?
3500810 3502070 Ma'am.
3514590 3515680 Excuse me...
3515920 3517320 Is this Natre's house?
3519290 3520450 What do you want?
3521760 3522790 Well...
3523170 3525330 We're her friends.
3526300 3528290 Natre's friends? Come inside.
3539380 3541850 Have some water. You must be tired.
3542180 3543780 Did you drive from Bangkok?
3544990 3546010 Yes.
3549120 3553150 We'd like to ask about Natre.
3554200 3555860 She's not feeling well.
3556270 3557560 She's taking a nap.
3559070 3560470 Should I wake her?
3564840 3566430 Stay for dinner.
3567310 3568540 I was about to cook.
3568740 3571110 I'm making her favourite dish.
3572820 3574370 Natre will be so happy.
3574880 3576710 Her friends don't visit often.
3577320 3578720 Wait right here.
3597670 3598940 Where are you going?
3673580 3674880 How dare you?
3680920 3682890 Did she commit suicide?
3687830 3689960 We should cremate her.
3691900 3692870 No.
3693070 3694430 I won't cremate her.
3696870 3697860 Ma'am...
3699510 3702380 I don't know if you believe such things...
3702840 3706210 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3707020 3710350 They were taken around campus.
3712650 3714990 Some of the places...
3715760 3718660 were rooms Natre had been in.
3719490 3723430 And these shadows appeared
3727000 3728230 I think that...
3729470 3732570 Natre's spirit is restless.
3734040 3735270 Natre...
3738910 3740380 My dear Natre.
3742580 3744480 Why don't you visit me?
3752960 3755360 Can you tell me what happened?
3756270 3757930 Why she left Bangkok?
3766440 3767700 Ma'am...
3769950 3771110 Ma'am.
3772480 3774110 These shadows...
3774680 3778020 might mean her spirit is not at peace.
3782360 3784550 We should hold her funeral.
3786090 3787430 Please.
3801610 3802840 When she came home...
3803050 3804480 she seemed different.
3804850 3806610 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
3807180 3809170 No one knows what happened in Bangkok.
3811150 3813310 Then she overdosed on pills.
3814020 3816420 Luckily, her mother found her...
3816790 3818660 and got her to the hospital on time.
3819160 3821430 When she recovered...
3822760 3825630 she climbed on the hospital roof...
3826270 3827790 and jumped off the edge.
3829970 3832740 Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?
3834840 3838070 She's been distraught<br />ever since Natre's death.
3838810 3842480 No matter what she refused to cremate her.
3843820 3846010 All the villagers were scared.
3846390 3849190 No one wanted to socialize with her.
3971910 3973140 Can't sleep?
3978950 3981010 Tell me the truth...
3981990 3983650 Did you love Natre?
3987460 3989190 I tried to...
3995470 3997960 I believed that one day I would.
4003710 4005610 But I was fooling myself.
4013620 4015060 When I broke it off...
4016290 4018730 I was a total asshole.
4024730 4026670 But she still loved me the same.
4033240 4035070 I want this to be over.
4037150 4039580 If she wants me to die I will.
4040650 4042310 Don't say that.
4043320 4044910 It's almost over.
4046290 4047410 No it's not.
4052590 4054860 I know she'll come for me.
4055760 4056820 Tun.
4057730 4059390 We've come this far.
4061740 4063700 And you're sorry for what you did.
4064670 4066230 I'm sure she knows.
4068610 4070240 Don't talk about death anymore.
4077350 4078750 I'm sorry.
4084390 4086160 Do you still love me?
4092100 4094930 No matter what you won't leave me, right?
4194140 4196160 Jane.
4289260 4290560 Tun...
4290930 4291920 Jane...
4292470 4293960 Where did you go?
4295270 4296760 Why did you leave me alone?
4297670 4298760 We've got to leave.
4302380 4303780 Asshole!
4305010 4306480 Why did you leave me?
4306680 4308380 Didn't you love me?
4308820 4310110 How could you leave me?
4313190 4315050 How could you leave me?
4414390 4415580 Tun...
4415960 4417520 Are you feeling better?
4420060 4422050 What happened last night?
4423530 4424590 Tun...
4426270 4427230 Jane...
4427440 4428560 Jane...
4435710 4436640 The abbot said...
4436840 4438810 Natre will be cremated today.
4442450 4444010 It's over.
4559900 4561460 - Hello.<br />- Hello, Jane.

4566710 4567800 Good.
4568010 4568840 When he's busy...
4569040 4570510 I get to see you.
4578620 4579950 You went on vacation?
4580790 4581850 To the beach.
4582390 4583520 When did you go?
4584230 4585750 Last week.
4588100 4590090 This photo is...
4593600 4594760 What's wrong?
4600940 4602170 You look fatter.
4604550 4605940 I didn't recognize you.

4812450 4814180 Why are you crying?
4817090 4818180 Asshole...
4820800 4822760 How could you be so cruel?
4828400 4829840 Where did you find these?
4832440 4834030 If I didn't find them...
4834240 4836470 I'd be a fool forever, right?
4842080 4843570 Let me explain.
4846820 4848520 What's there to say?
4852860 4854450 I always believed you.
4861570 4863500 I thought I knew you.
4877490 4878540 Tun.
4879790 4880910 Take her picture...
4881190 4882380 so she doesn't blab.
4882590 4884580 Tun, help me.
4886260 4887420 I know it was wrong.
4889060 4890860 Take her picture now!

4923160 4925130 But I was young and stupid.
4926700 4928070 I've heard enough.
4930170 4931660 I'm going home.
