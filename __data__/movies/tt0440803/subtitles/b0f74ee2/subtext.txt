236591 239591 Cheers!
247716 248966 Excellent.
249508 252174 Let's drink until we drop.
252383 254133 - You should save your energy for tonight.<br />- Mix it.
254299 256883 Are you kidding me, Tun?<br />Don't you know who I am?
257674 259883 Alcohol energizes me.
260341 262841 The later it gets, the hornier I become.
263258 264216 - Horny?<br />- Come, come.
264591 267174 - Let's toast.<br />- Here's another glass. Have a little sip.
270299 272091 So, tell me, Jane.
272841 273883 What year are you in?
274591 275466 I'm in my fourth year.
275549 277591 You're old enough to do what you want now.
278007 280590 So, how did you meet Tun?
280965 282173 Because he's a hunk.
283215 285257 You keep saying that since college.
285590 288423 Jim had to ask for her number for you,
288507 292590 - you pain in the ass.<br />- Speaking of college, do you remember
292965 294215 when you got your heart broken?
294298 297548 - He was so drunk.<br />- Which girl left him a drunken mess?
297632 300090 - Her name was Kay. I do remember that.<br />- It's "Teochew" Kay.
300173 302840 - Ignore them.<br />- Right. What do you mean by "ignore them"?
303465 306007 - Wait. I have a question.<br />- What?
306090 307632 How can a guy like you get married?
307715 309590 Why can't a guy like me get married?
310382 313007 After a long tiring day at work,
313507 315007 all I want is to head home
315423 317840 to cuddle with my wife or my dog,
317923 319590 not waste my life,
320173 324840 - partying with you losers, okay?<br />- I have nothing to do with this, man.
324923 326257 A good man...
326590 329215 went whoring with me last night.
331173 332382 Fooling around so soon?
333840 335090 Here she comes.
337840 338798 Quiet.
338923 340423 What's so funny?
341757 343048 Nothing, dear.
343382 345590 I have one last thing to say to you.
346298 348048 One more glass!
368047 369714 What are we listening to?
371756 373589 Hey. Don't turn it off.
373672 374881 It's beautiful.
377589 379256 You guys seem tight.
379506 381506 How long has it been<br />since you last saw each other?
385214 386381 What are you looking at?
387381 388547 Someone beautiful.
391089 392672 That's so sappy.
436547 437547 Are you okay?
439756 440589 Tun.
441922 443088 Is she dead?
452380 453296 Jane, wait!
463588 464505 Just drive away.
465838 467005 I said drive away!
468588 469755 Drive away!
480755 482380 Get closer, please.
482963 484130 Okay.
485130 486546 Big smile, Nuch.
487296 488921 Or you won't look pretty.
497380 499380 All Science graduates,
499463 501505 please gather on the stand<br />for a class photo.
502130 503463 They're calling you.
504296 505671 Where's Jane?
507213 509713 She's probably taking photos<br />with her friends.
510755 513338 I thought you guys broke up.
514046 515713 Come on. Let's go.
573254 575420 I called you so many times today<br />but you didn't pick up.
575879 577254 Was your phone on silent?
577337 578212 No, it wasn't.
586420 588295 Nuch asked about you today.
591295 593670 When will you be free?
593754 595587 She said she wants to...
617961 618794 Jane.
621044 622878 How can you act like this?
626628 628669 You're pretending like nothing happened.
631003 632336 Since that night,
632419 633794 I haven't been able to sleep at all.
636544 638128 Well...
638211 640128 You think it doesn't bother me?
642128 644586 We should have gone out<br />and checked how she was.
646669 648544 It was an accident, Jane.
650128 651711 That's easy for you to say.
653336 655419 You were not the one behind the wheel.
667836 669503 - Hi, Ti.<br />- Hey.
669836 671586 How's business?<br />Have you got a lot of customers?
672294 674128 With you here this early,
674711 676669 I don't think<br />many customers will be coming.
678544 680044 Are my prints ready?
681169 683128 Yes. Just a second.
688336 689169 Here.
713585 714918 Is your processor broken?
716502 717460 Let me see.
723043 723877 You punk.
724085 725752 If the prints turn out nice,<br />you get the credit.
726377 728252 If they suck, it's my fault.
728918 730293 Just look at the negatives.
731210 732668 This is impossible.
732752 734418 I took them. I should know.
734502 735502 We'll see.
737793 738877 See?
740377 742168 It's your fault your negatives are ruined.
766377 767210 Tun.
778376 779209 Tun.
797251 798167 Tun.
800584 801667 Can you hear me?
930875 931833 Help!
933291 934708 Help!
969040 971207 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
992207 993665 What's wrong with your camera?
995082 995957 I don't know.
996249 997790 The whole roll is ruined.
1000582 1002207 That many?
1008332 1009749 What are these shadows?
1010707 1012665 My camera must be broken.
1014749 1016790 I don't know how I'm going to tell Nuch.
1020789 1021748 Tun.
1023706 1025123 Look at this picture.
1036581 1037789 That woman...
1039123 1040581 Do you think she's dead?
1041289 1042623 That's enough, Jane.
1047956 1050789 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
1115330 1116247 Tun.
1116330 1117455 Look at this picture.
1142580 1144247 Are you sure it was here?
1151913 1152788 Excuse me.
1152913 1154038 What happened?
1155622 1158080 A few days ago,<br />a car ran into the billboard.
1158163 1159580 The driver must have been drunk.
1161747 1163663 Was anyone hurt?
1164872 1165872 No.
1166663 1167872 Just the broken sign.
1167997 1169330 Are you sure?
1169872 1170913 What?
1171080 1172247 Well...
1172663 1173872 Nothing, bro.
1175330 1176413 Thank you.
1178538 1179497 What?
1181955 1184496 Are you sure you checked everywhere?
1188079 1188912 It's nothing.
1189954 1191412 Thanks, anyway.
1196329 1198662 My friend called every police station<br />and hospital around the area.
1200329 1203787 He said there was no report<br />of any accidents that night.
1204454 1205996 How is that possible?
1207079 1208912 What about the girl we ran over?
1210579 1212996 Are you sure he called everywhere?
1213329 1215246 Maybe someone helped her.
1216079 1217621 Maybe she's fine.
1217704 1219412 How can she be fine?
1219496 1221496 We plowed into her like that.
1224371 1226412 And even if she's fine...
1227912 1229621 then what's in those photos?
1230246 1232871 I told you they're not related to her.
1233412 1234829 They're just bad exposures.
1234912 1235954 Don't you get it?
1300245 1301078 Tun.
1301953 1303620 I think you need to make merit, man.
1305036 1306120 These pictures...
1306786 1309203 show that there's a spirit haunting you.
1315536 1318203 How long have you been<br />a photographer, you punk?
1318286 1320078 Why are you showing me these?
1320245 1321411 I know, but...
1321911 1324453 Don't you find these shadows strange?
1326578 1328286 You want to see spirits?
1328995 1330370 I'll show you something.
1338661 1339495 Here.
1340286 1341411 This is Auntie Cham's spirit.
1342411 1343828 Do you know where she is now?
1346870 1349744 She's still selling fried bananas<br />in the next alley.
1351494 1353119 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1353785 1354827 Those are all Auntie Cham.
1355285 1356702 They were all taken on the same day.
1356952 1358785 They're just double exposures,
1358869 1360077 and out of focus.
1360994 1364160 Come on. I know that.
1372410 1374869 Everyone is probably familiar<br />with this place.
1376244 1378744 It's just an ordinary location...
1380077 1381369 that we pass by...
1382202 1383952 and see every day.
1389785 1391619 Now look at these pictures.
1395744 1398744 These are pictures of the same location.
1399535 1400660 But do you see...
1402035 1403744 that everything looks better?
1406035 1409077 That means photography
1409494 1411827 does not always convey reality.
1414535 1416035 It depends on how...
1417035 1419744 the image is framed,
1420452 1421952 what the photographer chooses to reveal,
1422327 1423785 and what to conceal.
1425327 1427785 Your perspective is critical.
1441076 1444201 SPECIAL SCOOP: SPIRIT PICTURES
1456284 1457868 Hey, Jane. You're early.
1459909 1461701 I'll get it.
1467201 1468909 - Hello?<br />- Hello, Tun.
1468993 1471284 It's me, Jane.<br />I'll come by in the afternoon.
1472534 1473451 Hello?
1473576 1475784 Tun, can you hear me?
1476409 1477368 Hello?
1477534 1478493 Tun!
1479034 1479993 Tun!
1480284 1481326 Hello?
1482493 1483451 Hello?
1512368 1513700 What's wrong?
1514575 1515575 I don't know.
1515742 1518117 My neck has been hurting<br />since the accident.
1519033 1520825 You should go see a doctor.
1522575 1524033 I'm sure it's nothing serious.
1527658 1529367 What's the use of talking to these quacks?
1530825 1534117 REAL GHOSTS, DEADLY SPIRIT,<br />GHOST STORIES, GHOST PATH
1536408 1537658 Are you a reporter?
1537950 1538867 No.
1540325 1542742 The funeral foundation told us<br />to come here.
1545242 1547367 We run a legal operation here.
1547950 1549408 We have all the permits.
1598907 1600199 Excuse me.
1600574 1603199 Are all these pictures fake?
1604574 1607032 Piak. Go tell our boss he has guests.
1610199 1611366 Everyone fakes them.
1613074 1613907 You know,
1614324 1616282 those photos are always a hit.
1617699 1619449 Any issues with them sell out.
1620824 1621657 Do you think...
1622241 1624157 we can always find real ones?
1625782 1628449 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1630157 1631866 Our readers...
1632657 1634407 want to see scary photos.
1636032 1637741 They don't want love stories.
1639491 1643032 Does that mean<br />all the published photos are fake?
1646241 1647699 I didn't say that.
1662199 1663074 Take a look.
1664282 1665282 Do you see anything?
1666491 1668782 This is the first photo I had.
1670116 1671491 I took it at home.
1673532 1674782 People say the shadow in the back
1674991 1677282 bears an uncanny resemblance to my mom.
1681031 1682823 Believe what you will.
1685073 1686198 But this picture...
1687240 1689615 was taken years after my mom passed away.
1692198 1693198 You know,
1693781 1694740 sometimes
1695073 1697490 spirits just want to be close<br />to their loved ones.
1704156 1705573 The pictures that you see,
1706490 1707698 for me,
1709031 1710406 are more than just...
1711156 1713198 pictures with strange shadows in them.
1715615 1717490 It's the stories behind the pictures.
1722656 1723823 Think about it.
1725365 1726740 Why would the dead...
1727823 1729198 return to the living...
1732948 1735698 if they are not trying<br />to tell us something?
1740365 1741448 Most importantly,
1742781 1744031 people also believe
1745323 1746490 that there are connections...
1747573 1750073 between the shadows<br />and someone in the picture.
1754365 1755573 A father.
1756240 1757156 A mother.
1757740 1758990 A lover.
1761280 1762405 Or it could be someone
1762489 1764572 whom you've wronged in the past.
1788905 1791614 How can we be sure<br />those photos aren't just bad exposures
1791780 1792947 or were forged?
1793780 1796322 What do you think about polaroids?
1800364 1801405 Can you forge them?
1802572 1804697 You load the film cartridge in,<br />press the shutter.
1805280 1806739 And out comes the photo.
1825280 1826655 Tell me, then.
1827905 1829405 How can they be faked?
1834030 1836489 How do we know what they want?
1837447 1840280 Perhaps the answer is in the photo.
1851321 1853196 Here's the last two shots.
1854238 1855488 Big smiles.
1859071 1862154 Can you change your pose for me?
1862738 1865779 Embrace her, hold the bouquet
1865863 1868029 and put your cheeks close together.
1869571 1870571 Good.
1870654 1871779 Beautiful.
1873654 1875529 We're done. Thank you.
1875613 1878404 Thank you to you both.
1878863 1881113 Take them to the dressing room.
1907363 1908821 What the hell?
1910613 1912029 Who's doing that?
1912779 1914196 Aum, check the fuse!
1916279 1917279 Hey, Aum!
1923113 1924196 Who's doing that?
1925695 1927695 Is it you, Aum?
1934195 1935028 Who is it?
1938237 1939653 Who's there?
1941820 1943070 I said, who's there?
1954028 1956403 Where are you, Aum?
1960903 1961778 Who's there?
2013819 2015111 Please step off the scale.
2019277 2020861 Step on it again.
2029069 2030444 Have you been working hard lately?
2030777 2032444 Well, not really.
2033152 2034527 How long has it been hurting?
2035486 2037277 For quite awhile.
2037361 2039694 But it's gotten worse lately.
2040944 2042486 I had a car accident.
2042944 2044194 A car accident?
2045069 2047194 I've done the examination<br />and everything seems fine.
2048194 2049652 You shouldn't worry.
2050402 2053277 But it really hurts, doctor.
2054236 2056569 Your x-rays came back normal.
2057194 2058486 It might be a muscle strain.
2059069 2061402 Try taking the medicine I prescribed.
2062444 2064527 Mr. Tun, your prescription's ready.
2068777 2072986 Take this medicine<br />three times a day after meals
2073277 2075402 until the prescription runs out.
2077569 2078861 Lying bastard.
2080361 2081277 Pardon?
2081361 2082194 Yes?
2083611 2085069 Nothing.
2090069 2091776 Lying bastard.
2093443 2094985 Lying bastard.
2096151 2098568 As for this medicine, the doctor said...
2098860 2100318 Sir!
2100651 2102401 What's wrong?
2105443 2107360 ...is rarely seen.
2107735 2110443 When grasshoppers begin mating,
2110651 2114026 the male can smell the female
2114818 2118568 from a distance up to 100 meters.
2119318 2123026 Then, the male will carefully approach<br />the female
2123901 2127485 and hook itself onto her belly.
2127818 2129818 And they will then begin to mate.
2131318 2135068 The female's response<br />to this is surprising.
2136443 2139943 The male will become her prey.
2140526 2144235 She will slowly eat his head off
2145276 2147526 while they are mating.
2149318 2153360 Eventually, the male succumbs to death.
2162193 2166318 - Excuse me, where is room 301?<br />- It's upstairs.
2172235 2173109 Jane.
2177400 2178525 Jane.
2188817 2189692 Jane.
2261941 2262983 Who's there?
2293149 2294024 Ton.
2295233 2296358 What's wrong?
2300108 2302608 Tun, I'm about to die.
2303358 2304774 What's going on?
2305816 2306774 The photos...
2308274 2309774 Bring me those photos.
2310774 2311983 What photos?
2312191 2313149 Are you drunk?
2315191 2316399 Those photos...
2317108 2318108 Where did you hide them?
2318733 2319816 Give them to me.
2322191 2323316 Do you remember that bitch?
2323774 2324899 Calm down, man.
2326149 2327149 What photos?
2327233 2328774 Just give them to me!
2329024 2331191 Calm down, man!
2332233 2333649 Ton, calm down.
2334149 2335774 What photos?
2341190 2342065 Ton.
2342482 2343982 I'll call your wife.
2388773 2389815 What are you doing?
2391940 2393315 I'm just tidying up the place.
2399732 2400857 Is your neck still sore?
2403565 2404398 Yes.
2404482 2406773 Take it easy. Don't work too hard.

2702978 2703894 Ton.
2705228 2706519 It's me, Tun.
2708478 2709519 Are you home?
2724686 2725728 Ton.
2728144 2729353 Are you home?
2738894 2740103 Ton.
2766185 2767768 MS. NETNAPA CHAN-NGAM
2816227 2817102 Ton!
2818518 2819477 Ton!
2821560 2822518 Ton!
2830185 2831477 Ton!
2869851 2871142 I'm really sorry.
2872642 2873684 You know, right?
2874017 2875434 You know what was bothering him.
2879892 2881601 I don't know. Suddenly he...
2881684 2883767 It's all because of you guys, right?
2886351 2888101 Have you all gone insane?
2889601 2891267 What do you mean?
2892392 2894434 Why did everyone commit suicide?
2895892 2896892 Who?
2898559 2899767 Didn't you know?
2900642 2902101 The other two
2902476 2904476 just jumped off the building<br />and killed themselves.
2905434 2906559 Which two?
2910101 2913892 The ones who sat next to you<br />at the wedding.
2960266 2961641 Who is this woman?
2966308 2967600 Where did you get that?
2968975 2971183 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2972891 2974225 Who is she?
2977266 2978975 How is she related to you?
2998515 3000099 I knew her in college.
3003724 3004932 Her name is Net.
3008890 3010807 She was a quiet person.
3012807 3013932 She didn't have any friends.
3018390 3020557 Everyone saw her as a freak.
3025724 3027349 I felt sorry for her.
3035099 3037182 We dated but I kept it a secret.
3041099 3042515 She loved me a lot.
3220847 3222888 She threatened to kill herself.
3224472 3226013 I didn't know what to do.
3226513 3228430 All my friends saw it as a joke.
3228763 3230680 How were they involved?
3231055 3232555 Why are they dead?
3233138 3233972 They...
3234388 3235680 What did they do?
3238180 3239347 I don't know.
3241263 3243513 Ton said he would take care of it.
3247387 3249262 After that, Net disappeared.
3251012 3253262 I never saw her again.
3254304 3256429 Didn't you try to stop them?
3258637 3260804 How could you let it happen?
3268346 3270096 What could I do?
3272512 3274179 Now everyone is dead.
3278096 3279221 I am...
3280054 3281971 I'm probably next.
3321887 3323137 It's funny.
3325721 3327845 We always say...
3328678 3330636 if we could turn back time,
3332220 3333303 we...
3333428 3335886 we wouldn't repeat our mistakes again.
3339136 3340886 Do you think she's okay?
3342303 3343970 Will we see her tomorrow?
3344386 3345428 Go to sleep.
3348053 3349928 I'll keep you company tonight.
3479635 3480552 Excuse me.
3482135 3483677 Do you have any toilet paper?
3520218 3521759 Would you mind letting me shit first?
3521843 3522843 I'm sorry.
3595217 3596717 What's going on, Tun?
3611675 3613008 Tun, what's wrong?
3625092 3626342 What is it?
3680257 3681757 Is it around here?
3693507 3694466 Excuse me.
3694966 3696257 Do you know where this house is?
3700966 3702591 Mom, do you know this house?
3738216 3739298 Ma'am.
3752840 3754048 Excuse me.
3754131 3755673 Is this Net's house?
3757673 3758923 What do you want?
3760173 3761173 Well...
3761631 3763840 We're her friends.
3765131 3767215 Net's friends? Come inside.
3778631 3781090 Have some water. You must be tired.
3781423 3783131 Did you drive here from Bangkok?
3784548 3785715 Yes.
3788756 3789798 Well...
3790340 3792631 We'd like to ask you about Net.
3794215 3795673 She's not feeling well.
3795756 3797506 She's taking a nap after taking her pills.
3799215 3800840 Should I wake her?
3805131 3806631 Stay for dinner.
3807590 3808965 I was about to cook.
3809131 3811798 I'm making Kang Som, Net's favorite dish.
3813465 3814923 Net will be so happy.
3815465 3817423 Her friends don't visit often.
3818048 3819465 Wait right here.
3839255 3840547 What are you doing, Tun?
3918379 3919546 What are you doing?
3925838 3927838 Did she commit suicide?
3933046 3935338 We should hold a funeral for her.
3937588 3938629 No.
3938713 3940296 I won't cremate my own daughter.
3942629 3943838 Ma'am.
3945213 3948296 I don't know if you believe such things,
3948671 3952129 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3953088 3956629 They were taken around campus.
3958921 3961629 Some of the places...
3962296 3965088 were rooms Net had been in.
3966213 3967213 And...
3967713 3970421 And those shadows appeared.
3973713 3974963 I think that...
3976338 3979754 Net's spirit is restless.
3981296 3982629 Net.
3986337 3987753 My dear Net.
3990337 3992087 Why don't you come visit me?
4001253 4003545 You know what happened to her, right?
4004503 4006253 And what happened in Bangkok.
4015170 4016253 Ma'am...
4018753 4019795 Ma'am.
4021378 4023212 The reason Net's spirit is still here
4023587 4027003 might be because<br />her spirit is not at peace.
4031712 4033878 We should hold a funeral for her.
4035670 4036670 Please.
4051670 4053128 Ever since Net came home,
4053212 4054837 she seemed different.
4055003 4056920 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
4057170 4059712 No one knew what happened in Bangkok.
4061628 4063920 One day, she overdosed on pills.
4064628 4067170 Luckily, her mother found her
4067420 4069627 and got her to the hospital in time.
4069961 4072461 After she fully recovered,
4073586 4076711 she climbed on the hospital roof
4077627 4079044 and jumped off the edge.
4081127 4083877 Why did Net's mom still kept<br />her body around?
4086336 4090086 She went a little crazy after Net's death.
4090586 4094086 No matter what anyone said,<br />she refused to cremate her.
4095586 4097627 The villagers got scared.
4098252 4101127 No one wanted to socialize with her.
4229168 4230418 Can't sleep?
4236459 4238250 Tell me the truth, Tun.
4239625 4241084 Did you love Net?
4245459 4247000 I tried to, Jane.
4253875 4256084 I believed that one day I would.
4262084 4264167 But I was fooling myself.
4272542 4274209 When I broke it off,
4275209 4277875 I was a total asshole to her.
4284125 4286209 But she still loved me.
4293000 4294792 I just want this to be over.
4297042 4299375 If she wants me to die, I will.
4300667 4302209 Don't say that.
4303375 4305042 It's almost over.
4306500 4307709 No, it's not.
4313167 4315333 I know she'll come for me.
4316374 4317416 Tun.
4318333 4320208 We've come this far.
4322749 4324541 And you're sorry for what you did.
4325624 4326999 I'm sure she knows.
4329666 4331249 Don't talk like that anymore.
4339208 4340083 I'm sorry.
4346416 4347916 Do you still love me?
4354374 4356874 You won't leave me no matter what, right?
4460790 4461707 Jane.
4461790 4462790 Jane.
4559914 4560914 Tun.
4561456 4562371 Jane.
4562996 4564496 Where were you?
4566038 4567663 Why did you leave me alone?
4568496 4569705 We've got to go, Jane.
4573413 4574455 Asshole!
4576121 4577746 Why did you leave me?
4578121 4579788 Don't you love me anymore?
4579996 4581705 Where are you going?
4584788 4586955 Where are you going?
4690204 4691495 Tun.
4692037 4693204 How are you feeling?
4696079 4697745 What happened last night?
4699579 4700412 Tun.
4702162 4703204 Jane.
4703537 4704745 Jane.
4712204 4715204 The abbot said Net's body<br />will be cremated today.
4719537 4720537 It's over.
4841577 4843452 - Hello.<br />- Hello, Jane.
4843868 4845285 You're here to pick up the photos?
4845743 4846618 Where's Tun?
4846993 4848160 He's busy.
4848660 4849702 Good.
4850118 4852702 I hope he gets busy often,<br />so I can see you instead.
4860243 4862368 You guys went on vacation?
4863327 4864868 We went to Hua Hin.
4864952 4866285 When did you go?
4866952 4868535 Last week.
4872077 4873368 This photo is...
4876702 4877702 What's wrong?
4884077 4885452 Are you getting fatter?
4888077 4889743 I almost didn't recognize you.
4892076 4893242 Hi.
4894242 4896034 - Jumbo prints, please.<br />- Okay.
4897076 4898326 Write your name here, please.
5064657 5065865 Get her!
5102990 5104074 Jane.
5105074 5106657 Why are you crying?
5109449 5110449 Asshole.
5113324 5114990 How could you be so cruel?
5120490 5122574 Jane, where did you find these?
5124532 5127032 - Jane.<br />- If I didn't find them,
5127240 5129657 I'd be a fool forever, right?
5135449 5136949 Let me explain, Jane.
5140364 5142156 What is there to say?
5146698 5148323 I've always believed you.
5155698 5157614 It turns out I don't know you at all.
5172198 5173323 Tun.
5174656 5177364 Take her pictures, so she doesn't blab.
5177739 5179656 Tun, help me!
5181323 5182573 I know it was wrong.
5184406 5186323 Take her pictures now!
5187448 5188531 What's wrong?
5190281 5191739 I'm your buddy!
5192364 5193489 Hurry!
5202281 5204198 Tun, help me!
5218406 5220281 I never forgave myself.
5220406 5222197 But I was young and stupid.
5223572 5224988 Stop talking.
5227072 5228488 I want to go home.
5285947 5287072 Come out.
5292155 5293238 Where are you?
5300613 5302155 Didn't you say you love me?
5304779 5306196 Didn't you love me so much?
5314196 5316237 Till death do us part, huh?
5321904 5323321 Jane's gone now!
5427236 5431195 Sometimes, spirits just want to be close<br />to their loved ones.
