236591 239399 Cheers!
247643 249100 Excellent.
249693 252016 Let's drink until we drop.
252334 254029 Save something for your wife.
254281 257125 Are you kidding?
257513 259942 Alcohol revives me.
260155 262821 The later it gets, the hornier I get.
263177 266957 Another glass. A little sip.
270337 272173 Tell me, Jane...
272735 274086 What year are you in?
274473 275160 4th year.
275376 277662 A senior should know better.
277913 280449 What are you doing with Tun?
280902 282181 He's a hunk.
282432 285002 You keep saying that.
285246 287983 Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.
288236 288994 Then breaking their hearts.
289243 292714 Speaking of broken hearts...
292927 294384 Remember the time...
294595 297961 that girl left him a drunken mess.
298314 299321 Her name was Kay.
299565 301295 Ignore them.
303353 305533 Wait. I have a question.
305856 307799 How can a guy like you get married?
308010 309503 What's wrong with me?
310235 312901 After a long tiring day...
313293 314916 I want to head home...
315274 317668 to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.
317881 319409 Not waste my life...
320001 322145 partying with you losers.
322398 324093 Not with me.
325040 326177 A good man...
326639 329068 who went whoring with me last night.
330705 332435 Fooling around so soon?
333903 335217 Here she comes.
337864 338550 Quiet.
338768 339870 What's so funny?
341687 342718 Nothing.
343181 345539 One last thing...
346309 348288 One more glass!
368135 369486 What are we listening to?
371888 373132 Don't turn it off.
373348 374735 It's beautiful.
377519 379284 You guys seem tight.
379534 381193 Do you meet often?
385130 386303 What are you looking at?
387145 388567 Beautiful you.
391038 392317 What a sap.
436184 437712 Are you hurt?
439520 440834 Tun...
441814 443401 Is she dead?
452101 453523 Wait!
463466 464710 Drive away.
465412 467106 I said drive away!
468366 469823 Drive away!
480425 482297 Get closer, please.
482928 483935 Okay.
485013 486506 Big smile, Nuch.
487341 488692 Or you won't look pretty.
497351 498938 All Science Majors...
499192 501478 gather for a class photo.
502008 503287 They're calling you.
504371 505544 Where's Jane?
507047 509582 Taking photos with her friends.
510766 513017 I though maybe you broke up.
513963 515621 Come! Let's go.
573080 575260 I phoned but you didn't pick up.
575652 576860 Was it on silent?
586252 587946 Nuch asked about you today.
591465 593301 When will you be free?
593550 595529 She wants to...
617809 619052 Jane.
620867 622597 How can you act like this?
626602 628675 Pretending nothing happened.
630945 632118 Since that night...
632371 634029 I haven't slept soundly.
638139 639905 I'm upset as well.
642067 644496 At least we should have checked.
646480 648731 It was an accident.
650060 651790 That's easy for you to say.
653362 655163 You weren't behind the wheel.
667785 669372 - Hi, Ti.<br />- Hey.
669940 671776 How's business?
672095 674145 With you here this early...
674562 676541 business should be bad.
678350 680222 Are my prints ready?
681200 683001 Yeah. Just a sec.
688116 689218 Here.
713486 714837 Is your processor broken?
716406 717578 Let's see.
722592 723906 The nerve.
724122 725543 Nice prints and you're great.
725755 728290 If they suck, it's my fault.
728674 730132 Let's check the negative.
731142 732421 No way.
732636 734022 I took them. I should know.
734270 735407 We'll see.
737884 739021 See.
740386 742116 Your negative are bad.
766243 767451 Tun.
778129 779586 Tun.
796966 798317 Tun.
800406 801899 Can you hear me?
930838 932189 Help!
933306 934928 Help!
968929 971499 Don't be scared. I'm here now.
992040 993462 What's wrong with your camera?
994856 995863 I don't' know.
996072 997660 The whole roll is ruined.
1000417 1002182 That many?
1008132 1009754 What are these shadows?
1010843 1012573 My camera must be broken.
1014735 1016536 How should I tell Nuch?
1020643 1021994 Tun...
1023527 1024984 Look at this picture.
1036595 1037803 That woman...
1038994 1040380 Do you think she's dead?
1041148 1042250 That's enough.
1047786 1050179 I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.
1115174 1116038 Tun...
1116252 1117638 Look at this picture.
1142456 1144079 Are you sure it was here?
1151631 1152567 Excuse me.
1152778 1153785 What happened?
1154237 1157780 A few days ago a car hit the billboard.
1158235 1159514 Must have been drunk.
1161606 1163655 Was anyone hurt?
1164733 1165871 No.
1166436 1167823 Just the broken sign.
1168070 1169421 Are you sure?
1169668 1170568 What?
1172102 1173724 Nothing.
1175090 1176334 Thank you.
1178392 1179529 What?
1181798 1184013 You sure you checked everywhere?
1187671 1189022 Nothing.
1189722 1191001 Thanks anyways.
1196082 1198582 He called every precinct and hospital.
1200252 1203831 No accidents were reported that night.
1204249 1205706 That's not possible.
1206960 1208761 What about the girl we hit?
1210505 1212827 You sure he called every one?
1213112 1214948 Maybe someone helped her.
1215544 1217486 Maybe she's fine.
1217769 1219190 How could she be fine?
1219436 1221273 We ploughed her down.
1224407 1226137 And even if she's fine...
1227813 1229543 Something is in those pictures.
1230036 1232774 I told you they're not related to her.
1233304 1234477 They're just bad exposures.
1234693 1236186 Get it?
1300170 1301237 Tun...
1301943 1303601 You need to make some merit.
1305140 1306348 These pictures...
1306738 1309025 show that a spirit is haunting you.
1315566 1318066 How long have you been a photographer?
1318277 1319972 Why are you showing me these?
1320328 1321263 I know...
1321787 1324003 But don't you find these shadows strange?
1326618 1327969 You want to see spirits?
1329016 1330295 I'll show you some.
1338609 1339367 Here.
1340102 1341275 Auntie Cham's spirit.
1342327 1343678 You know where she is now?
1346810 1349689 She's selling grilled bananas next door.
1351467 1352853 Here's Auntie Cham. And here.
1353622 1354724 All Auntie Cham.
1355291 1356534 Taken on the same day.
1356924 1358132 They're just double exposures...
1358383 1359911 and out of focus.
1360886 1363800 Come on. I know that.
1372459 1374639 Everyone is familiar with this place.
1376247 1378605 Just an ordinary location...
1380036 1381694 that we pass...
1382329 1383881 and see everyday.
1389662 1391604 Now look at these pictures...
1395675 1398589 taken of the same place.
1399463 1400778 In these...
1401965 1403588 the bridge looks nicer.
1405892 1407206 That means photography...
1407665 1412108 does not reproduce reality.
1414546 1415897 It depends on how...
1416944 1419646 the image is framed.
1420280 1421832 What is revealed.
1422227 1423922 What is concealed.
1425181 1427883 Your perspective is critical.
1439708 1443381 "Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures"
1456390 1457847 Jane, you're early.
1460422 1461701 I'll get it.
1466920 1468650 - Hello?<br />- Hello, Tun.
1468901 1470951 It's Jane. I'll come by later.
1472447 1473170 Hello?
1473420 1475564 Tun, can you hear me?
1475817 1477096 Hello?
1477312 1478626 Tun!
1478875 1480190 Tun!
1480961 1482063 Hello?
1482281 1483869 Hello?
1512379 1513693 What's wrong?
1514534 1515541 I don't' know.
1515749 1517799 My neck's hurt since the accident.
1518913 1520643 You should go see a doctor.
1522631 1523946 I'm sure it's not serious.
1527532 1529226 What's the use of talking to these spoofs?
1530972 1533567 "Real Ghosts"
1536185 1537642 Are you a reporter?
1537923 1538989 No.
1540112 1542683 The funeral foundation sent us.
1545013 1547299 We run a legal operation.
1547620 1549456 We have all the right permits.
1598917 1600019 Excuse me.
1600480 1602874 Are all these pictures fakes?
1604582 1607011 Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.
1609968 1611354 Everyone fakes them.
1612923 1613989 You know...
1614278 1616220 these photos are always a hit.
1617440 1619514 Any issue with them sells out.
1620638 1621645 But you think...
1622097 1623862 we can always find real ones?
1626233 1628484 Isn't that deceiving the public?
1629952 1631717 Our readers...
1632385 1634458 want to see scary photos.
1635860 1637483 They don't want loves stories.
1639301 1642843 Does that mean every photo is fake?
1646077 1647984 I didn't say that.
1662099 1663272 Take a look.
1664289 1665747 See anything?
1666409 1668803 This is the first photo I had.
1670093 1671515 I took it at home.
1673359 1674639 The shadow...
1674924 1677495 bears a likeness to my mom.
1680971 1682737 Believe what you will.
1684932 1686070 But this picture...
1686914 1689864 was taken after she passed away.
1691953 1693410 You know...
1693691 1694721 sometimes...
1694942 1697477 spirits long for their loved ones.
1703978 1705400 In my opinion...
1706307 1707658 these pictures...
1708878 1710406 represent more than...
1711068 1713118 macabre urban legends.
1715447 1717733 They are signs.
1722537 1723888 Think about it.
1725248 1726800 Why would the dead...
1727611 1729269 return to the living...
1732789 1735775 Without a message to convey?
1740261 1741683 Most importantly...
1742625 1744082 I believe...
1745196 1746689 these shadows...
1747455 1750026 are related to someone in the picture.
1754476 1755790 A father...
1756179 1757281 mother...
1757604 1758990 or lover.
1761183 1762498 Or someone...
1762713 1764786 you maligned in life.
1788708 1791481 How can we tell if they're real...
1791698 1793084 and not fakes?
1793469 1794962 What about Polaroid's?
1795172 1796630 Can you fake them?
1800213 1804763 You load the film and press the shutter.
1805216 1806567 The photo ejects.
1825131 1826861 Tell me then...
1827668 1829682 How can they be faked?
1833785 1836487 How do we know what they want?
1837121 1838151 Perhaps...
1838442 1840349 the answer is in the photo.
1851266 1853208 Two more poses.
1854115 1855608 Big smiles.
1859607 1862273 Let's have a different pose.
1862943 1865964 Embrace her, hold the bouquet...
1866176 1868285 and kiss her cheek.
1870763 1871865 Beautiful.
1873509 1875451 We're done.
1875837 1878301 Thank you both.
1878756 1881042 Take them to the dressing room.
1907429 1908815 What the...
1910695 1912010 Who's doing that?
1912606 1914099 Aum, check the fuse!
1916082 1917539 Hey! Aum!
1920809 1921673 Aum!
1922998 1924171 Who's doing that?
1925500 1927550 Is it you, Aum?
1934085 1935293 Who is it?
1938081 1939633 Aum, where are you?
1941766 1943294 Who's there!
1943990 1945305 I asked who it is!
1953721 1955379 Where are you, Aum?
1960845 1962302 Who's there!
2013602 2015261 Please step off the scale.
2018989 2020648 Step on it again.
2028790 2030484 Been working hard lately?
2030736 2032288 Not really.
2032960 2034453 How long has it hurt?
2035463 2037370 For quite awhile.
2037583 2039525 But it's gotten worse lately.
2040016 2042267 I had a car accident.
2042900 2044214 An accident?
2044881 2046824 Physically, you're fine.
2048043 2049430 You shouldn't worry.
2050407 2053001 But it really hurts.
2054265 2056516 Your x-rays are normal.
2056871 2058458 It may be a sprain.
2058817 2060962 Try the medicine I prescribed.
2062328 2064472 Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.
2068618 2069897 Take this medicine...
2070286 2072644 3 times a day after meals...
2072928 2075250 until the prescription runs out.
2077376 2078620 Lying bastard.
2079878 2080707 Pardon?
2080921 2082023 Yes?
2083424 2084976 Nothing.
2089818 2091548 Lying bastard.
2093328 2094679 Lying bastard.
2095865 2097393 As for this medicine...
2099410 2100096 Sir!
2100348 2102291 What's wrong?
2105423 2107046 ...is rarely seen.
2107577 2110112 When grasshoppers begin mating...
2110636 2113693 the male smells the female...
2114528 2118273 from a distance up to 100 meters.
2119116 2122860 The male carefully approaches the female.
2123668 2126856 It hooks itself onto her belly.
2127596 2129468 And they begin to mate.
2131141 2134991 The female's response is surprising.
2136215 2139722 The male becomes her prey.
2140386 2144166 She slowly eats off his head...
2144765 2147431 while they are mating.
2149421 2150452 Eventually...
2150672 2152923 the male succumbs to death.
2161967 2165403 Excuse me, where is Room 301?
2172011 2172947 Jane.
2177155 2178647 Jane.
2188485 2189799 Jane.
2261538 2262747 Who's there?
2292609 2293781 Tonn...
2294728 2296150 What's wrong?
2299872 2300879 Tun...
2301088 2302581 I'm going to die.
2302791 2304486 What's going on?
2305189 2306326 The photos...
2308004 2309497 Bring me those photos.
2310610 2311854 What photos?
2312140 2313207 Are you drunk?
2314955 2316341 Those photos...
2316797 2318385 Where did you hide them?
2318639 2319990 Give them to me.
2321767 2323259 Remember that bitch.
2323539 2324570 Calm down.
2325763 2326628 What photos?
2326841 2328536 Just give them to me!
2328927 2330692 Please calm down.
2331950 2333407 Tonn, calm down.
2334244 2335701 What photos?
2341056 2342264 Tonn.
2342481 2343973 I'll call your wife.
2388599 2389878 What are you doing?
2391484 2393071 Cleaning up.
2399407 2400900 Your neck still sore?
2402987 2404195 Yeah.
2404446 2406591 Take it easy. Don't work so much.

2704827 2706379 It's Tun.
2708059 2709587 Are you home?
2724323 2725461 Tonn.
2727869 2729421 Are you home?
2738607 2739816 Tonn.
2765542 2766821 "Natrenapa Chan-ngam"
2815900 2817452 Tonn!
2818195 2819332 Tonn!
2821287 2822495 Tonn!
2829732 2831284 Tonn!
2868275 2871154 I'm really sorry.
2872515 2873794 Do you know...
2874044 2875572 What was bothering him?
2879605 2881193 No. Suddenly he...
2881412 2883735 It's your gang's fault.
2886174 2887974 Have you all gone insane?
2889336 2890994 What do you mean?
2892221 2894271 You've all committed suicide.
2895661 2896834 Who?
2898303 2899795 Don't you know?
2900492 2902020 The other two...
2902438 2904547 also killed themselves.
2905289 2906568 Which two?
2909980 2913938 The two who sat next to you.
2960096 2961588 Who's this woman?
2966143 2967600 Where did you get that?
2968923 2971068 She's the shadow in the photos, right?
2972781 2973989 Who is she?
2977020 2979070 How is she related to you?
2998186 3000236 I knew her in college.
3003468 3005020 Her name is Natre.
3008751 3010825 She was a quiet person...
3012643 3014065 without any friends.
3018378 3020321 We all thought she was weird.
3025711 3027369 I felt sorry for her.
3034921 3037207 We dated but I kept it secret.
3040898 3042320 She loved me a lot.
3220612 3222377 She threatened to slit her wrists.
3224261 3225956 I didn't know what to do.
3226555 3228320 My friends thought it was funny.
3228849 3230436 How were they involved?
3231004 3232354 Why are they dead?
3232985 3234157 They...
3234374 3235476 What did they do?
3238024 3239303 I don't know.
3240735 3243199 Tonn said he'd take care of it.
3247303 3249069 After that, Natre disappeared.
3250987 3253097 I never saw her again.
3254150 3256330 Didn't you try to stop them?
3258528 3261301 How could you let it happen?
3268121 3269673 What could I do?
3272187 3273881 Now everyone is dead.
3277574 3278853 I'm...
3279867 3281455 I'm going to die next.
3321816 3323167 It's funny how...
3325604 3327583 we always say...
3328558 3330394 if we could turn back time...
3332242 3333213 we...
3333459 3335509 we would reverse all our wrongs.
3339054 3340749 Do you think she's okay?
3342252 3343673 Will she be there?
3344128 3345265 Go to sleep.
3347986 3349538 I'll keep you company tonight.
3479356 3480564 Excuse me.
3481928 3483420 Do you have any toilet paper?
3519880 3521337 Can I poo first?
3521547 3523005 I'm sorry.
3595017 3596297 What's bothering you?
3610727 3612349 Tun. What's wrong?
3624975 3626397 What is it?
3680200 3681515 Is it around here?
3692885 3694236 Excuse me.
3694867 3696181 Do you know where this is?
3700774 3702753 Mom, where is this house?
3738135 3739449 Ma'am.
3752489 3753626 Excuse me...
3753878 3755336 Is this Natre's house?
3757389 3758597 What do you want?
3759961 3761028 Well...
3761420 3763671 We're her friends.
3764687 3766761 Natre's friends? Come inside.
3778311 3780881 Have some water. You must be tired.
3781230 3782888 Did you drive from Bangkok?
3784150 3785216 Yes.
3788459 3792653 We'd like to ask about Natre.
3793742 3795472 She's not feeling well.
3795897 3797248 She's taking a nap.
3798816 3800274 Should I wake her?
3804828 3806487 Stay for dinner.
3807400 3808679 I was about to cook.
3808895 3811359 I'm making her favourite dish.
3813135 3814758 Natre will be so happy.
3815289 3817196 Her friends don't visit often.
3817826 3819283 Wait right here.
3839027 3840341 Where are you going?
3918092 3919443 How dare you?
3925738 3927788 Did she commit suicide?
3932931 3935147 We should cremate her.
3937172 3938179 No.
3938388 3939810 I won't cremate her.
3942350 3943381 Ma'am...
3945096 3948082 I don't know if you believe such things...
3948571 3952078 but I'd like you to look at these photos.
3952915 3956387 They were taken around campus.
3958789 3961218 Some of the places...
3962021 3965042 were rooms Natre had been in.
3965913 3970013 And these shadows appeared
3973733 3975012 I think that...
3976305 3979528 Natre's spirit is restless.
3981066 3982345 Natre...
3986141 3987669 My dear Natre.
3989963 3991942 Why don't you visit me?
4000772 4003271 Can you tell me what happened?
4004213 4005943 Why she left Bangkok?
4014812 4016127 Ma'am...
4018462 4019670 Ma'am.
4021103 4022798 These shadows...
4023397 4026868 might mean her spirit is not at peace.
4031390 4033676 We should hold her funeral.
4035282 4036669 Please.
4051444 4052723 When she came home...
4052938 4054431 she seemed different.
4054814 4056650 She wouldn't talk to anyone.
4057247 4059321 No one knows what happened in Bangkok.
4061383 4063634 Then she overdosed on pills.
4064372 4066871 Luckily, her mother found her...
4067257 4069199 and got her to the hospital on time.
4069724 4072082 When she recovered...
4073477 4076463 she climbed on the hospital roof...
4077127 4078714 and jumped off the edge.
4080984 4083863 Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?
4086058 4089424 She's been distraught<br />ever since Natre's death.
4090195 4094010 No matter what she refused to cremate her.
4095408 4097694 All the villagers were scared.
4098083 4100998 No one wanted to socialize with her.
4228828 4230107 Can't sleep?
4236162 4238306 Tell me the truth...
4239324 4241054 Did you love Natre?
4245024 4246824 I tried to...
4253364 4255959 I believed that one day I would.
4261949 4263928 But I was fooling myself.
4272271 4273764 When I broke it off...
4275051 4277586 I was a total asshole.
4283844 4285859 But she still loved me the same.
4292706 4294613 I want this to be over.
4296772 4299308 If she wants me to die I will.
4300422 4302152 Don't say that.
4303202 4304860 It's almost over.
4306296 4307468 No it's not.
4312864 4315222 I know she'll come for me.
4316166 4317268 Tun.
4318215 4319945 We've come this far.
4322386 4324436 And you're sorry for what you did.
4325445 4327068 I'm sure she knows.
4329546 4331240 Don't talk about death anymore.
4338651 4340108 I'm sorry.
4345984 4347820 Do you still love me?
4354012 4356963 No matter what you won't leave me, right?
4460290 4462399 Jane.
4559375 4560726 Tun...
4561112 4562142 Jane...
4562711 4564263 Where did you go?
4565631 4567182 Why did you leave me alone?
4568132 4569270 We've got to leave.
4573033 4574490 Asshole!
4575779 4577307 Why did you leave me?
4577516 4579282 Didn't you love me?
4579741 4581092 How could you leave me?
4584294 4586236 How could you leave me?
4689703 4690946 Tun...
4691336 4692959 Are you feeling better?
4695611 4697684 What happened last night?
4699225 4700327 Tun...
4702075 4703082 Jane...
4703291 4704464 Jane...
4711910 4712881 The abbot said...
4713091 4715141 Natre will be cremated today.
4718930 4720553 It's over.
4841265 4842888 - Hello.<br />- Hello, Jane.
4843524 4844591 Picking up photos?
4845436 4846371 Where's Tun?
4846582 4847862 He's busy.
4848354 4849492 Good.
4849710 4850575 When he's busy...
4850787 4852315 I get to see you.
4860762 4862148 You went on vacation?
4863021 4864123 To the beach.
4864689 4865862 When did you go?
4866601 4868188 Last week.
4870633 4872706 This photo is...
4876367 4877575 What's wrong?
4884013 4885292 You look fatter.
4887766 4889223 I didn't recognize you.
4891832 4892839 Hi.
4893883 4895126 Jumbo prints.
4896906 4898186 Write you name, please.
5064282 5065597 Get her guys!
5102754 5103892 Jane...
5104319 5106120 Why are you crying?
5109150 5110287 Asshole...
5113008 5115057 How could you be so cruel?
5120931 5122423 Where did you find these?
5125137 5126795 If I didn't find them...
5127013 5129335 I'd be a fool forever, right?
5135181 5136733 Let me explain.
5140116 5141881 What's there to say?
5146406 5148064 I always believed you.
5155477 5157491 I thought I knew you.
5172055 5173157 Tun.
5174452 5175625 Take her picture...
5175912 5177155 so she doesn't blab.
5177372 5179446 Tun, help me.
5181195 5182403 I know it was wrong.
5184114 5185986 Take her picture now!
5187207 5188379 What's wrong!
5189988 5191516 I'm your buddy!
5192037 5193104 Hurry!
5202151 5204058 Tun, help me.
5218069 5219420 I never forgave myself.
5219633 5221683 But I was young and stupid.
5223316 5224738 I've heard enough.
5226932 5228483 I'm going home.
5285665 5287052 Come on out!
5292061 5293482 Where are you?
5300297 5301992 I thought you loved me!
5304432 5306198 Loved me so much!
5313990 5316276 Till death do us part!
5321601 5323295 She's gone now.
5426697 5427976 Sometimes...
5428226 5430655 spirits long for their loved ones.
