89338 91173 See you tomorrow.
93259 95719 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARS]
110484 111526 Oh, my God!
134175 135676 I'm in.
248789 250582 We're almost there.
250750 254712 - Sir, are you sure about this?<br />- I told you, we're going to be all right.
254879 259379 I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping<br />some serious sentinel activity up here.
298506 300925 - Link.<br />- Yes, sir?
301091 304219 Given your situation, I can't say<br />I understand your reasons...
304386 307055 ...for volunteering to operate<br />on board my ship.
307223 311227 However, if you wish to continue to<br />do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
311769 313228 What's that, sir?
313979 315271 To trust me.
315439 317399 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
319443 322612 - I mean, I do, sir.<br />- I hope so.
322780 326158 Repatch the main AC to the hard drives<br />and stand by to broadcast.
326325 327409 Yes, sir.
327618 329453 [DOOR OPENS]
336252 338504 Still can't sleep?
340464 341840 You wanna talk?
344176 346553 They're just dreams.
348889 351266 If you're afraid of something...
351433 353268 I just wish...
353936 356188 I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
356355 358190 That's all.
359108 360692 I just wish I knew.
360860 365114 She's gonna call. Don't worry.
365281 366323 Here you are.
366490 369951 - Are we ready to go?<br />- We're already late.
370119 374619 These geotherms confirm<br />the last transmission of the <i>Osiris.</i>
375499 377167 The machines are digging.
378836 381129 They're boring from the surface<br />down to Zion.
381297 383882 - Mother...<br />- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
384049 385550 How fast are they moving?
385718 389096 Control estimates their descent<br />at 100 meters an hour.
389263 391723 MAN 1: How deep are they?<br />- Almost 2000 meters.
391891 395436 - What about the scans from the <i>Osiris?</i><br />- They can't be accurate.
395603 397521 - They may be.<br />- It's not possible.
397688 400148 That'd mean there are<br />a quarter-million sentinels.
400316 401817 -That's right.<br />MAN 2: That can't be.
401984 403652 MORPHEUS:<br />Why not?
403819 407572 A sentinel for every man,<br />woman and child in Zion.
408532 412494 That sounds exactly like<br />the thinking of a machine to me.
412661 414829 Morpheus, glad you could join us.
415331 416498 Niobe.
417875 421253 My apologies to all.<br />But as you are undoubtedly aware...
421420 424714 ...it's become difficult to locate<br />a secure broadcast position.
424882 428135 - Squiddies got our best spots.<br />- Lines are crawling with them.
428302 432097 And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours<br />there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
432264 433390 What are we gonna do?
433557 435850 We're gonna do what<br />Commander Lock ordered.
436185 438770 We'll evacuate broadcast level<br />and return to Zion.
438938 443438 And does the commander have a plan<br />for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
444234 446903 A strategy is still being formulated.
447071 448739 I'm sure it is.
463754 465756 MAN: What do you think<br />we should do, Morpheus?
465965 468092 MORPHEUS: Proceed as ordered...<br />- What is it?
468258 469300 I don't know.
469468 472262 MORPHEUS: ...however, I must<br />ask one of you for help.
472429 476929 Some of you believe as I believe, some<br />of you do not. Those of you that do...
478310 480854 ...know we are nearing<br />the end of our struggle.
481021 485275 The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.<br />But before it can be...
485442 488778 ...the Oracle must be consulted.
496704 498956 If we return and recharge now...
499123 502876 ...we can be back in 36 hours, well<br />before the machines reach this depth.
503085 504920 Do you understand what you're asking?
505087 507923 I am asking that one ship<br />remain here in our place...
508090 510801 ...in case the Oracle<br />should attempt to contact us.
510968 514096 Bullshit. You're asking one of us<br />to disobey a direct order.
514263 518763 That's right, I am. But we well know<br />that the reason most of us are here...
518976 521603 ...is because of our affinity<br />for disobedience.
521770 523688 What happens when you<br />get back to Zion...
523856 526275 ...and the commander<br />throws you in the stockade?
526442 527651 He won't.
528777 531988 Goddamn it, Morpheus,<br />you ain't never gonna change.
532698 535450 Shit, I'll do it just to see<br />what Deadbolt does to you.
535617 537160 You got 36 hours.
539955 541790 SMITH:<br />I'm looking for Neo.
541957 545335 - Never heard of him.<br />- I have something for him.
546545 548755 A gift.
548964 551841 You see, he set me free.
554136 556513 Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
557056 558098 Who was that?
558265 560100 MAN:<br />How did you know someone was here?
560267 561726 He gave you this.
567483 568901 He said you set him free.
570861 573196 Is everything all right, sir?
573822 576199 The meeting is over.<br />Retreat to your exits.
576366 578576 - Agents are coming.<br />- Agents?
579036 580412 Go.
580579 582372 [POUNDING]
590214 591298 Hiya, fellas.
591465 592734 AGENT 1: It's him.<br />- The anomaly.
592758 594009 - Do we proceed?<br />- Yes.
594176 596678 - He is still...<br />- Only human.
602851 605103 Hm. Upgrades.
660033 662577 -That went as expected.<br />SMITH 2: Yes.
662744 665413 It's happening exactly as before.
665581 668250 Well, not exactly.
671962 674089 -What happened?<br />LINK: I can't figure it out.
674256 675924 Agents just came out of nowhere.
676091 679094 Then the code got all weird.<br />Encryption I've never seen.
679261 682180 - Is Neo okay?<br />- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
682347 683765 Where is he now?
685225 686976 He's doing his Superman thing.
736944 738403 Where are you?
743075 746661 This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i><br />requesting access through Gate Three.
750707 755169 <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i> this is Zion Control.<br />Maintain present velocity and stand by.
755337 756838 LINK:<br /><i>Roger that, Control.</i>
757005 760508 This is Control requesting immediate<br />stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
761301 764512 We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i><br />on approach. Let's open her up.
770102 773021 <i>You are cleared through<br />Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>
773188 774898 Roger that, Control.
782030 785116 Door's open, bed's made.<br />Welcome home.
785867 788035 No place like it.
802217 805929 Roger that, Control. Zion Control,<br />stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
855437 857856 CONTROL: <i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.<br />Bay Seven.</i>
858023 859190 Understood.
869159 870451 Captain Mifune.
871536 872703 Captain Morpheus.
872871 875707 Are you here to escort me<br />to the stockade, captain?
875874 878314 - I'm just here to keep the peace.<br />- Commander Lock demands...
878418 880044 [MIFUNE CLEARS THROAT]
880545 883714 Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
884633 886468 - Link.<br />- Sir?
886635 889220 I want the ship ready to go<br />as soon as possible.
889388 890931 Understood, sir.
898105 900524 - What is it between them?<br />- Morpheus and Lock?
901650 903818 - Niobe.<br />- Captain Niobe?
903985 907196 She used to be with Morpheus.<br />Now she's with Lock.
908448 910032 What happened?
910242 913662 Morpheus went to the Oracle.<br />After that, everything changed.
913829 916498 Yeah, she can do that.
916665 917832 BOY:<br />Neo!
918834 921711 NEO: Oh, no.<br />- How does he always know?
921878 923838 Doesn't he have anything better to do?
924005 926716 You know what they say<br />about the life you save.
926883 928676 I didn't save his life.
930846 932222 Hiya, Neo.
933390 936017 -Trinity, Link.<br />LINK: Hey.
936184 939854 - It's great to have you back.<br />- Thanks. It's good to be back.
940021 942773 - Can I carry that for you?<br />- No, I can carry my own bag.
942941 944609 - Trinity?<br />- I'm fine.
945569 948446 - You can carry these.<br />- Yeah, sure, Link.
953368 957868 Hey, you know, next year<br />I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
958039 960791 I've been thinking about it,<br />and I've made my decision.
960959 962418 Let me guess.
962919 964879 I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
965881 969426 Morpheus hasn't filled the other<br />positions, except for you, Link.
969593 970969 I'm sure he has reasons...
971136 974472 ...but the more I think about it,<br />the more I think it's meant to be.
974639 976182 You know, it's fate.
976349 977892 You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
978059 980603 I told you, you found me.<br />I didn't find you.
980770 983314 I know, but you got me out.<br />You saved me.
984441 986067 You saved yourself.
1002375 1005669 -Morpheus.<br />MORPHEUS: Commander Lock.
1005921 1010421 I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to<br />offer you a chance to explain your actions.
1010592 1013469 I wasn't aware that my actions<br />required any explanation.
1013637 1015930 You were given an order<br />to return to Zion.
1016097 1018933 - I did.<br />- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
1019100 1021769 I would have stayed,<br />but I needed to recharge my ship.
1021937 1024648 So you admit to a direct contravention<br />of your duty.
1024814 1028234 We need a presence inside the Matrix<br />to await contact from the Oracle.
1028401 1030361 I don't want to hear that shit!
1030529 1033198 I don't care about oracles<br />or prophecies or messiahs!
1033365 1036785 I care about one thing: Stopping that<br />army from destroying this city.
1036952 1039788 To do that I need soldiers<br />to obey my orders.
1039955 1044455 With all due respect, commander,<br />there is only one way to save our city.
1044709 1046127 How?
1046294 1049088 - Neo.<br />- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
1049256 1051883 Not everyone believes what you believe.
1052050 1054135 My beliefs do not require them to.
1062310 1066230 There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's<br />talking. A lot of people are scared.
1066398 1069150 No one remembers the last time<br />so many ships were docked.
1069317 1072278 - Something big is happening, isn't it?<br />- Hey.
1072445 1075614 We're not allowed to say anything,<br />so stop asking.
1080912 1084040 Goddamn, it's good to be home.
1097053 1100014 I'm recommending that you<br />be removed from duty.
1100181 1102516 That is, of course,<br />your prerogative, commander.
1102684 1106562 If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot<br />on a ship for the rest of your life.
1106730 1109482 Then I am grateful that<br />it is not up to you.
1109649 1111108 [DOOR OPENS]
1115947 1118366 - Councillor Hamann.<br />- Commander.
1119034 1121745 - Captain.<br />- Councillor.
1121911 1125289 Council's asked me to speak tonight<br />at the temple gathering.
1125457 1129544 The presence of the fleet and the<br />persistence of rumors must be addressed.
1129711 1132213 The people must be told<br />what is happening.
1132380 1134090 Of course, councillor.
1134799 1139299 But might I advise a level of discretion<br />concerning specific details.
1140221 1143224 - We do not wish to start a panic.<br />- Quite right.
1143391 1146477 A panic is not what anyone wants.
1146645 1149981 What about you, captain?<br />What would you advise?
1152400 1156900 The truth. No one will panic,<br />because there is nothing to fear.
1157322 1159449 That army won't reach<br />the gates of Zion.
1160241 1163827 - What makes you so sure?<br />- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
1163995 1165871 Consider that in the past six months...
1166039 1168082 ...we have freed more minds<br />than in six years.
1168249 1171252 This attack is an act of desperation.
1171419 1175256 I believe very soon the prophecy<br />will be fulfilled and this war will end.
1177133 1179260 I hope you're right, captain.
1179427 1182138 I do not believe it to be<br />a matter of hope, councillor.
1182305 1184890 It is simply a matter of time.
1187060 1188519 My stop.
1188687 1190105 See you soon.
1190271 1191730 Hopefully not too soon.
1191898 1195067 Let's go, kid.<br />These two got things to do.
1204494 1206245 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1206413 1208832 I am if you're thinking<br />this elevator is too slow.
1208998 1212334 - How long do we charge the <i>Neb?</i><br />- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
1212502 1216714 Some people go their entire lives<br />without hearing news that good.
1241156 1245493 Neo, please, I have a son,<br />Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis.</i>
1245660 1249163 - Please, watch over him.<br />- I'll try.
1249330 1251415 WOMAN:<br />I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus.</i>
1252208 1253500 No, wait.
1253668 1256170 It's all right. They need you.
1256337 1258589 - I need you.<br />- I know.
1259132 1261425 There's time.
1266389 1268516 Where's my puss...?
1268683 1271018 - Hey!<br />- Uncle Link!
1271186 1272812 God!
1272979 1274939 CHILDREN:<br />Uncle Link!
1275106 1278692 Oh, my God! You're so huge!
1278860 1281028 - You should be picking me up!<br />- No!
1281196 1282739 -Yeah!<br />CHILDREN: Okay!
1282906 1284616 LINK:<br />Okay? All right.
1284783 1287827 Now, we're gonna have<br />to work together here, okay?
1287994 1290204 One, two, three, lift!
1290371 1293540 Oh, my God!<br />What are you feeding these two?
1293708 1296419 Come on, kids. It's time to go.
1298213 1299547 -Hey, Cas.<br />CAS: Hey.
1300089 1302633 - Good to have you home, Link.<br />- Good to be home.
1302801 1304636 You be careful with her.
1304803 1307597 Don't worry about me.<br />He's the one that's gonna get it.
1309432 1311809 CAS:<br />Out the door! Both of you, march!
1311976 1314019 LINK: Bye!<br />CAS: Bye!
1320401 1321944 I'm gonna get what?
1323238 1327325 Every ship up there's been home two, even<br />three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
1327492 1331329 Come on, Zee.<br />I thought we were past this.
1331496 1334916 - We'll be when you operate another ship.<br />- I can't do that.
1335083 1336584 - Why?<br />- You know why.
1336751 1339920 If Dozer knew how I felt,<br />he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
1340630 1343174 Maybe. But it's too late now.
1343341 1345968 I made a promise,<br />and some promises can't be unmade.
1346135 1348846 - It's not fair.<br />- Nobody said it was gonna be.
1349013 1351974 You think Cas thinks it's fair<br />that I'm here and Dozer's not?
1357897 1361108 I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
1362193 1364403 I'm afraid of it.
1365989 1368616 I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
1369284 1371119 It won't.
1371286 1373121 How can you say that to me?
1373288 1375248 Because of Morpheus.
1375415 1379915 Because of what he's told me. He said<br />that this is it, that it will be over soon.
1380211 1384423 - Link, Morpheus is crazy.<br />- No doubt.
1384924 1388135 But Tank and Dozer believed him.<br />And I'll tell you what...
1388303 1392803 ...after being on that ship and seeing Neo<br />do the things he can do, I gotta say...
1393808 1395851 ...I'm starting to believe him too.
1400982 1403401 Be careful, Link.
1408740 1411117 Please be careful.
1420209 1423629 - They started yet?<br />- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
1423796 1426882 Tonight, let us honor<br />these men and women.
1427050 1429677 These are our soldiers, our warriors.
1429844 1434098 These are our husbands and wives,<br />our brothers and sisters...
1434265 1435933 ...our children.
1436517 1439645 Let us remember those<br />that have been lost...
1439812 1443023 ...and let us give thanks<br />for those that have been found...
1443191 1446485 ...and who stand here beside us.
1446694 1450364 Now I would like someone else<br />to close this prayer...
1450531 1453742 ...someone who hasn't spoken here<br />in a long time...
1453910 1458410 ...but who I believe has something to say<br />that we all need to hear.
1460291 1461875 I give you Morpheus.
1481396 1485566 Zion! Hear me!
1486567 1489695 It is true what many of you have heard.
1489862 1493866 The machines have gathered<br />an army, and as I speak...
1494033 1497953 ...that army is drawing nearer to our home.
1498121 1499163 [CHATTERING]
1499414 1503914 Believe me when I say we have<br />a difficult time ahead of us.
1504752 1509252 But if we are to be prepared for it,<br />we must first shed our fear of it.
1511426 1515926 I stand here before you now<br />truthfully unafraid.
1516931 1518682 Why?

1529360 1533280 I remember that I am here not because<br />of the path that lies before me...
1533448 1536784 ...but because of the path<br />that lies behind me.
1536951 1541451 I remember that for 100 years<br />we have fought these machines.
1541789 1546289 I remember that for 100 years<br />they have sent their armies to destroy us.
1546711 1551211 And after a century of war,<br />I remember that which matters most:
1553676 1556679 We are still here!
1563394 1565479 Tonight...
1565646 1569024 ...let us send a message to that army.
1569192 1572236 Tonight, let us shake this cave.

1621035 1623454 I remember you used to dance.

2145017 2147310 I like it down here.
2147478 2151978 I like to be reminded this city survives<br />because of these machines.
2153442 2157942 These machines are keeping us alive<br />while other machines are coming to kill us.
2158989 2163489 Interesting, isn't it?<br />The power to give life...
2163994 2167205 - ...and the power to end it.<br />- We have the same power.
2167373 2170084 Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
2170250 2173711 ...sometimes I think about those people<br />still plugged into the Matrix.
2173879 2176882 And when I look at these machines...
2177049 2181549 ...I can't help thinking that, in a way,<br />we are plugged into them.
2182429 2185306 But we control these machines,<br />they don't control us.
2185724 2188727 Of course not. How could they?
2188894 2191438 The idea is pure nonsense...
2191939 2195067 ...but it does make one wonder just...
2195234 2196818 ...what is control?
2197069 2200113 If we wanted, we could<br />shut these machines down.
2200489 2204951 Of course. That's it. You hit it.<br />That's control, isn't it?
2205577 2208955 If we wanted,<br />we could smash them to bits.
2209206 2213335 Although if we did, we'd have to consider<br />what would happen to our lights...
2213502 2216171 ...our heat, our air.
2217172 2221301 So we need machines and they need us.<br />Is that your point, councillor?
2221468 2224095 No. No point.
2224805 2228892 Old men like me don't bother<br />with making points. There's no point.
2229685 2233480 Is that why there are no young men<br />on the Council?
2233647 2235315 Good point.
2236024 2240194 Why don't you tell me<br />what's on your mind, councillor.
2240362 2243615 There is so much in this world...
2243782 2246701 ...that I do not understand.
2248495 2252995 See that machine? It has something to do<br />with recycling our water supply.
2253417 2256420 I have absolutely no idea how it works.
2256587 2260674 But I do understand the reason<br />for it to work.
2262176 2266676 I have absolutely no idea how you<br />are able to do some of the things you do.
2267848 2271017 But I believe there's a reason for that<br />as well.
2271894 2276394 I only hope we understand that reason<br />before it's too late.
2283530 2285198 - Ballard.<br />- Is he here?
2287618 2290203 Neo, it's from the Oracle.
2293165 2294875 It's time to go.
2295834 2298294 Morpheus said this was how<br />it was gonna happen.
2298462 2302883 I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,<br />maybe it's not.
2303425 2306594 All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
2308180 2310056 Right now, that operator's me.

2429927 2432095 I understand that, commander.
2432262 2434847 Then why did you allow<br />the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?

2492823 2497323 I am Seraph. I can take you to her,<br />but first I must apologize.
2497577 2499287 Apologize for what?
2499955 2501748 For this.
2559056 2561308 Good.
2563810 2566979 The Oracle has many enemies.<br />I had to be sure.
2567147 2569357 - Of what?<br />- That you are the One.
2569816 2573569 - You could have just asked.<br />- No. You do not truly know someone...
2573737 2575989 ...until you fight them.
2576531 2579992 Come. She's waiting.
2595050 2596926 Where the hell did they go?

2604184 2607937 - How do they work?<br />- A code is hidden in tumblers.
2608105 2612605 One position opens a lock and another<br />position opens one of these doors.
2614861 2617697 Are you a programmer?
2617864 2620199 Then what are you?
2622369 2625872 I protect that which matters most.
2645392 2648770 ORACLE:<br />Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
2649187 2651981 Come around here<br />and let me have a look at you.
2655193 2657570 My goodness, look at you.
2657904 2660740 You turned out all right, didn't you?
2660907 2663117 - How do you feel?<br />- I...
2663285 2666871 I know you're not sleeping.<br />We'll get to that.
2667038 2669749 Why don't you come<br />and have a sit this time.
2670458 2674587 - Maybe I'll stand.<br />- Well, suit yourself.
2685724 2688268 - I felt like sitting.<br />- I know.
2689436 2691354 So...
2693440 2695859 ...let's get the obvious stuff<br />out of the way.
2696151 2700613 - You're not human, are you?<br />- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
2700780 2705280 If I had to guess, I'd say you're<br />a program from the machine world.
2706995 2711207 - So is he.<br />- So far, so good.
2711374 2714543 But if that's true, that could mean<br />you're part of this system...
2714711 2717296 ...another kind of control.
2717464 2721964 - Keep going.<br />- I suppose the most obvious question is...
2722135 2726055 - ...how can I trust you?<br />- Bingo.
2727098 2730351 It is a pickle, no doubt about it.<br />Bad news is...
2730518 2734188 ...there's no way you can really know<br />if I'm here to help you or not.
2734356 2737901 So it's really up to you. Just have<br />to make up your own damn mind...
2738068 2742568 ...to either accept what<br />I'm going to tell you or reject it.
2744157 2746325 Candy?
2749037 2753458 - Do you already know if I'll take it?<br />- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
2753625 2756836 But if you already know,<br />how can I make a choice?
2757003 2761048 Because you didn't come here to make<br />the choice. You've already made it.
2761216 2765716 You're here to try to understand<br />why you made it.
2771393 2774354 I thought you'd have figured that out<br />by now.
2776106 2778691 - Why are you here?<br />- Same reason.
2778942 2781694 I love candy.
2781861 2784697 But why help us?
2784864 2788367 We're all here to do<br />what we're all here to do.
2788910 2791996 I'm interested in one thing, Neo:<br />the future.
2792163 2796375 And believe me, I know, the only way<br />to get there is together.
2797210 2801710 - Are there other programs like you?<br />- Well, not like me, but...
2802299 2804968 Look. See those birds?
2805218 2808596 At some point, a program was written<br />to govern them.
2808763 2813263 A program was written to watch over the<br />trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
2814853 2817730 There are programs running<br />all over the place.
2817897 2822359 The ones doing their job, doing what<br />they were meant to do, are invisible.
2822527 2826364 You'd never even know they were here.<br />But the other ones...
2826531 2830618 Well, you hear about them all the time.
2831202 2834079 - I've never heard of them.<br />- Of course you have.
2834247 2838747 Every time you've heard someone<br />say they saw a ghost or an angel...
2839336 2843836 ...every story you've ever heard about<br />vampires, werewolves or aliens...
2844090 2846425 ...is the system assimilating<br />some program...
2846593 2851093 ...that's doing something<br />they're not supposed to be doing.
2851431 2854434 Programs hacking programs.
2854601 2857478 - Why?<br />- They have their reasons...
2857645 2861607 ...but usually a program chooses exile<br />when it faces deletion.
2862025 2865945 - And why would a program be deleted?<br />- Maybe it breaks down.
2866112 2870612 Maybe a better program is created<br />to replace it. Happens all the time.
2870825 2875325 And when it does, a program<br />can either choose to hide here...
2875955 2878624 ...or return to the source.
2880293 2883587 - The machine mainframe.<br />- Yes.
2883755 2886257 Where you must go.

2927090 2930093 You are looking at the world<br />without time.
2930260 2932679 Then why can't I see<br />what happens to her?
2932846 2936599 We can never see past the choices<br />we don't understand.
2936766 2939935 Are you saying I have to choose<br />whether Trinity lives or dies?
2940186 2943981 No, you've already made the choice.
2944149 2946693 Now you have to understand it.
2947318 2948694 No.
2948862 2952115 I can't do that. I won't.
2952824 2955201 - Well, you have to.<br />- Why?
2955785 2958871 Because you're the One.
2961040 2964043 What if I can't?
2964210 2966212 What happens if I fail?

2998411 3001288 - And he won't let him go willingly.<br />- What does he want?

3007003 3010256 Be there at that exact time...
3010423 3013092 ...and you will have a chance.
3013885 3016137 We must go.

3127665 3131210 ...compelled to disobey.
3131794 3135547 And now, here I stand<br />because of you, Mr. Anderson.
3135715 3139677 Because of you, I'm no longer an agent<br />of this system.
3139844 3143055 Because of you, I've changed.<br />I'm unplugged.
3143222 3147722 A new man, so to speak.<br />Like you, apparently free.
3148394 3149770 Congratulations.
3150521 3152856 Thank you.
3153441 3157941 But as you well know,<br />appearances can be deceiving...
3158237 3162737 ...which brings me back to the reason<br />why we're here.
3163576 3168076 We're not here because we're free.<br />We're here because we are not free.
3168623 3172543 There's no escaping reason,<br />no denying purpose.
3172710 3176088 Because as we both know,<br />without purpose...
3176255 3180755 - ...we would not exist.<br />- It is purpose that created us.
3181260 3184263 -Purpose that connects us.<br />SMITH 4: Purpose that pulls us.
3184430 3186350 SMITH 5: That guides us.<br />SMITH 6: That drives us.
3186432 3190932 - It is purpose that defines.<br />- Purpose that binds us.
3191312 3193772 We are here because of you,<br />Mr. Anderson.
3193940 3198319 We're here to take from you<br />what you tried to take from us:
3200279 3202364 Purpose.
3205451 3207327 - What's happening to him?<br />- Don't know.
3210373 3213959 Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
3320817 3323277 - You.<br />- Yes, me.
3327448 3330325 Me, me, me.
3335206 3336874 Me too.
3449320 3451447 [SCREAMS]
3464627 3465669 More.
3527940 3530776 It is inevitable.
3531193 3532611 Come on, get out of there.
3575821 3578156 Are you all right?
3579241 3581159 - It was Smith.<br />- Yes.
3582036 3584663 MORPHEUS: Now there's more than one?<br />- A lot more.
3584830 3588625 - How is that possible?<br />- I don't know.
3588793 3591253 Somehow, he's found a way<br />to copy himself.
3591420 3595632 - Is that what he was doing to you?<br />- I don't know what he was doing...
3595800 3598552 - ...but I know what it felt like.<br />- What?
3599470 3603182 It felt like I was back in that hallway.
3603349 3604767 It felt like dying.
3605267 3608144 The machines are tunneling to avoid<br />our defense system.
3608312 3612149 But I believe they will intersect<br />certain pipelines to control them.
3612316 3614860 These points of intersection<br />are crucial...
3615027 3617821 ...because I believe they're<br />vulnerable to counterattack.
3617988 3622033 Although it has been suggested that<br />this is the same kind of attack...
3622201 3625871 ...we've defended for years,<br />I urge the Council to realize the truth.
3626038 3629374 This is the single greatest threat<br />we have ever faced...
3629542 3633379 ...and if we do not act accordingly,<br />we will not survive.
3633546 3637550 Commander Lock, the Council is well<br />aware of the seriousness of this attack.
3637842 3642342 You have our leave to prepare our defense<br />by any and all means necessary.
3642555 3645224 -Thank you, Council.<br />DILLARD: However...
3645474 3648810 ...we ask if there's been word<br />from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3649061 3651563 No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
3653190 3657152 Then we request a ship be dispatched<br />to ascertain the fate of the One.
3657319 3661072 I wish that were possible, councillor,<br />but I do not believe our defense...
3661240 3664785 - ...can suffer the loss of another ship.<br />- It will, commander, if it must.
3664952 3667287 It could take one ship days<br />to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3667454 3670498 - Then send two.<br />- This is insane.
3670666 3673669 Careful, commander.
3673878 3677214 Forgive my frustration, councillors.
3677381 3681259 But I wish I were able to comprehend<br />the Council's choice in this matter.
3681427 3684596 Comprehension is not<br />a requisite of cooperation.
3684763 3687223 If you are asking me<br />to order two of my captains...
3687391 3689101 There's no need for such an order.
3689268 3692813 The captains are present.<br />They can answer for themselves.
3693272 3697772 The Council is calling for two volunteers<br />to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3698694 3702864 Are there two among you<br />that would answer such a call?
3704158 3707953 Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i><br />will answer the Council's call.
3708120 3711039 You understand the situation,<br />Captain Soren?
3711207 3713667 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Thank you, captain.
3715085 3716503 Is there another?
3717296 3721008 - Captain, I think we should volunteer.<br />- What? You have gone crazy.
3721175 3723051 - Listen...<br />- Shut your hole, Bane...
3723219 3724720 ...before I put you in one.
3734563 3736314 Is there no other?
3737066 3738984 Be hard for any man to risk his life...
3739151 3742112 ...especially if he doesn't<br />understand the reason.
3742571 3746074 Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i><br />will answer the councillor's call.
3746242 3748494 - What?<br />- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
3748702 3753202 Commander Lock, you have your orders.<br />This Council is hereby adjourned.
3758504 3761089 - Niobe, what are you doing?<br />- What I can.
3761257 3762299 Why?
3763592 3766845 Because some things<br />never change, Jason...
3767012 3769347 ...and some things do.
3785781 3787199 What can you see, Neo?
3787366 3789701 It's strange.<br />The code is somehow different.
3789868 3791452 - Encrypted?<br />- Maybe.
3791620 3793580 Is that good for us or bad for us?
3794290 3797418 Well, it looks like every floor<br />is wired with explosives.
3798043 3799586 Bad for us.
3800004 3801505 Here we go.
3807469 3808845 [SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
3809513 3812432 Yes. We are here to speak<br />with the Merovingian.
3812891 3816728 Well, of course.<br />He has been expecting you.
3816895 3817937 Follow me.
3838625 3842295 A-ha. Here he is at last.
3842504 3845798 Neo, the One himself.
3845966 3847384 Right?
3847551 3849886 And the legendary Morpheus.
3850721 3855221 And Trinity, of course.<br />I have heard so much.
3855768 3859229 You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.<br />This is my wife, Persephone.
3860147 3863441 Something to eat? Drink?
3863734 3866778 Of course, such things are contrivances,<br />like so much here.
3866945 3869447 For the sake of appearances.
3869615 3873076 - No, thank you.<br />- Yes, of course. Who has time?
3873243 3877743 Who has time? But then, if we do not ever<br />take time, how can we ever have time?
3882044 3885422 Château Haut-Briond, 1959.<br />Magnificent wine.
3885589 3888508 I love French wine<br />like I love the French language.
3888675 3892845 I have sampled every language. French<br />is my favorite. Fantastic language...
3893013 3895140 ...especially to curse with.
3895432 3897976 [SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
3899144 3903644 You see? It's like wiping your ass<br />with silk. I love it.
3905317 3907068 You know why we are here.
3908821 3913321 I am a trafficker of information.<br />I know everything I can.
3914118 3918618 The question is,<br />do you know why you are here?
3920249 3922709 We are looking for the Keymaker.
3923377 3927877 Oh, yes, it is true.<br />The Keymaker, of course.
3928048 3931009 But this is not a reason,<br />this is not a why.
3931176 3934929 The Keymaker himself, his very nature,<br />is a means, it is not an end.
3935097 3939597 And so to look for him is to be<br />looking for a means to do...
3941019 3944188 - ...what?<br />- You know the answer to that question.
3944356 3946483 But do you?
3946692 3949027 You think you do, but you do not.
3949194 3952405 You are here<br />because you were sent here.
3952573 3955701 You were told to come here,<br />and then you obeyed.
3956869 3959204 It is, of course, the way of all things.
3959371 3962040 You see, there is only one constant...
3962207 3966377 ...one universal. It<br />is the only real truth.
3966545 3968213 Causality.
3968380 3970673 Action, reaction.
3970841 3975053 - Cause and effect.<br />- Everything begins with choice.
3975220 3976971 No. Wrong.
3977139 3981639 Choice is an illusion created<br />between those with power...
3981894 3983979 ...and those without.
3985522 3988691 Look there at that woman.
3989401 3993321 My God, just look at her...
3993572 3996241 ...affecting everyone around her.
3996408 4000908 So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.<br />But wait.
4001413 4005166 Watch. You see, I have sent her<br />a dessert...
4005375 4009587 ...a very special dessert.
4013926 4016386 I wrote it myself.
4016553 4019764 It starts so simply...
4019932 4024432 ...each line of the program creating<br />a new effect, just like...
4025562 4027188 ...poetry.
4027356 4028774 First...
4029274 4033774 ...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
4035280 4037907 You can see it, Neo, yes?
4038534 4041119 She does not understand why.
4041370 4043789 Is it the wine? No.
4043956 4046333 What is it then? What is the reason?
4046959 4049294 And soon it does not matter.
4049461 4052464 Soon the why and the reason are gone...
4053423 4057923 ...and all that matters<br />is the feeling itself.
4059429 4062515 And this is the nature of the universe.
4062683 4065227 We struggle against it,<br />we fight to deny it...
4065394 4067979 ...but it is, of course, pretense.<br />It is a lie.
4068146 4072150 Beneath our poised appearance...
4072317 4076817 ...the truth is, we are completely...
4080492 4083369 ...out of control.
4088709 4093209 Causality. There is no escape from it.<br />We are forever slaves to it.
4094006 4098506 Our only hope, our only peace,<br />is to understand it, to understand the why.
4099636 4103056 "Why" is what separates us from them...
4103223 4105516 ...you from me.
4105684 4109437 "Why" is the only real source of power.<br />Without it, you are powerless.
4109605 4112899 And this is how you come to me,<br />without why, without power.
4113066 4115860 Another link in the chain.
4116069 4117361 But fear not.
4117529 4121407 Since I have seen how good you are<br />at following orders...
4121575 4124202 ...I will tell you what to do next.
4124703 4129203 Run back and give the fortuneteller<br />this message:
4129750 4134004 Her time is almost up.
4135047 4138592 Now I have some real business to do,<br />so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.
4138759 4141261 - This isn't over.<br />- Oh, yes, it is.
4141428 4145928 The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason<br />why I should give him up.
4147976 4152021 - No reason at all.<br />- Where are you going?
4152189 4156689 Please, <i>ma chérie,</i> I have told you.<br />We are all victims of causality.
4157069 4160405 I drank too much wine,<br />I must take a piss.
4160906 4164034 Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir.</i>
4169081 4172167 Touch me and that hand<br />will never touch anything again.
4181051 4182552 Well, that didn't go so well.
4182719 4185096 Are you certain the Oracle<br />didn't say anything else?
4185263 4187390 - Yes.<br />- Maybe we did something wrong.
4188058 4189392 Or didn't do something.
4189559 4192812 No, what happened couldn't have<br />happened any other way.
4192979 4195731 - How do you know?<br />- We are still alive.
4195899 4196941 [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
4199027 4202280 If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
4209287 4211372 Get out.
4213291 4217791 I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.<br />On and on. Pompous prick.
4220215 4224715 A long time ago, when we first came here,<br />it was so different.
4227472 4230183 He was so different.
4231977 4234604 He was like you.
4237315 4241110 I'll give you what you want,<br />but you have to give me something.
4241862 4244155 - What?<br />- A kiss.
4244531 4245657 Excuse me?
4247159 4251079 I want you to kiss me<br />as if you were kissing her.
4252998 4256584 - Why?<br />- You love her. She loves you.
4256835 4258795 It's all over you both.
4259463 4263963 A long time ago,<br />I knew what that felt like.
4265343 4269843 I want to remember it.<br />I want to sample it. That's all.
4271349 4273184 Just a sample.
4273351 4276354 - Why don't you sample this instead?<br />- Trinity.
4278565 4283065 Such emotion over something so small.<br />It's just a kiss.
4283695 4285863 Why should we trust you?
4286031 4290035 If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,<br />she can kill me.
4297125 4299252 All right.
4299544 4303381 But you have to make me believe<br />I am her.
4304591 4306634 All right.
4312974 4314809 Terrible. Forget it.
4317771 4319230 Wait.
4320148 4321691 Okay.
4358770 4360855 Yes.
4361439 4363941 That's it.
4378707 4383207 I envy you. But such a thing<br />is not meant to last.
4387132 4388508 Come with me.
4419581 4421332 Not again.
4424753 4427380 It's all right, boys. They're with me.

4981684 4984436 <i>- Won't be easy.</i><br />- I know. We're inside the core network.
4984604 4987231 <i>The only exit I got<br />near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>
4987398 4989483 - Off the freeway.<br /><i>- Yes, sir.</i>

5026437 5028939 Oh, no. This is getting real ugly<br />real fast.
5029106 5030816 Are you watching this, Link?
5030983 5034611 Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.<br />Eight units headed your way.
5035655 5037615 Any suggestions?
5039492 5041494 - Turn right.<br />- Right, now.

5051963 5054674 MORPHEUS: <i>Got it.</i><br />- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
5054840 5058552 - In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...<br />- Link, what did I tell you?
5058844 5061137 Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
5061305 5063807 - I'll be ready for you.<br />- Good man.
5063975 5066143 You always told me<br />to stay off the freeway.
5066310 5068937 - Yes, that's true.<br />- You said it was suicide.
5069146 5071064 Then let us hope...
5071232 5072608 ...that I was wrong.

5084495 5085695 - Operator.<br />- Link, it's Niobe.
5085746 5087372 We've been sent to bring you in.
5087540 5090626 - I need to talk to Morpheus.<br />- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
5090793 5092795 <i>- Where is he?</i><br />- Just follow the sirens.
5100344 5102262 Repeat, they're approaching the...

5288741 5291952 - We are getting aggravated.<br />- Yes, we are.

5345172 5347257 Come on!
5364275 5365776 Crush him.
5396265 5397307 Morpheus.
5397474 5398975 He's okay. Keep moving.
5399977 5401770 Let's go.
5407526 5409694 I need a download<br />to hot-wire a motorcycle.
5409862 5412197 No problem.<br />One crash course on motorcycle...
5412364 5413782 Wait.
5415159 5416618 Cancel that.
5416785 5418995 You are handy.
5419163 5421081 Jump on.
5568353 5569395 She means nothing.
5569563 5572691 - Find the exile.<br />- We have them.

5714333 5715959 Gotcha.
5716710 5717794 She's good.
5722174 5724467 You are no longer necessary.
5731141 5734853 We do only what we're meant to do.
5736480 5740066 Then you are meant for one more thing:<br />deletion.
5741026 5742902 Go kick his ass.
5792953 5795705 Neo, if you're out there,<br />I could use some help.
5796456 5797915 What is that?
5827779 5830656 Yes! Yes!
5837247 5841747 We have confirmation from the <i>Icarus.</i> First<br />two ships are in position for counterattack.
5842627 5843669 Good.
5844671 5845713 Any change?
5845881 5848633 They hit some iron ore here.<br />Slowed them down a little.
5848800 5851928 - How much?<br />- An hour, maybe.
5852095 5854639 That would give them<br />a little over nine hours.
5855474 5857100 Yes, sir.
5889716 5891968 KEYMAKER:<br /><i>There is a building.</i>
5892135 5896635 Inside this building, there is a level<br />where no elevator can go...
5897974 5899892 ...and no stair can reach.
5900560 5905060 <i>This level is filled with doors.<br />These doors lead to many places.</i>
5906817 5909152 Hidden places.
5909486 5913114 But one door is special.
5913281 5915491 One door leads to the source.
5923834 5928255 This building is protected<br />by a very secure system.
5928422 5932922 - Every alarm triggers the bomb.<br />- Bomb? Did he say bomb?
5933176 5935845 KEYMAKER: But like all systems,<br />it has a weakness.
5936012 5939015 The system is based on the rules<br />of a building.
5939182 5942560 - One system built on another.<br />- Electricity.
5943103 5947603 - If one fails, so must the other.<br />- No electricity, no alarms.
5948024 5950860 You'd have to take out a city block<br />to kill the power.
5951027 5954739 - Not one, 27.<br />- Twenty-seven blocks?
5955574 5958034 KEYMAKER:<br /><i>There is a power station.</i>
5958201 5960453 <i>It must be destroyed.</i>
5960620 5964957 - There must be some kind of fail-safe.<br />- Yes, there is an emergency system.
5966585 5970380 <i>The core network of the grid<br />must be accessed.</i>
5970547 5973383 <i>The emergency system<br />must be deactivated.</i>
5973550 5974968 SOREN:<br /><i>What do you need us for?</i>
5975135 5977303 Neo could take them out<br />easier than we could.
5977471 5979222 - There's no time.<br />- Why?
5979389 5982517 Once the door is unprotected,<br />the connection will be severed.
5982684 5984977 But another connection<br />must first be made.
5985812 5989649 SOREN: <i>How long will that take?</i><br />KEYMAKER: <i>Exactly 314 seconds.</i>
5989816 5991400 MAN:<br /><i>Just over five minutes.</i>
5991568 5993820 KEYMAKER: <i>That is the length<br />and breadth of the window.</i>
5993987 5996280 Only the One can open the door...
5996490 5999409 ...and only during that window<br />can the door be opened.
6000660 6002244 How do you know all this?
6002412 6006912 I know because I must know.<br />It is my purpose.
6007751 6012251 It's the reason I'm here,<br />the same reason we're all here.
6024017 6026811 Neo, I know something's wrong.
6027479 6029522 You don't have to tell me.
6029689 6033442 I just want you to know that I'm here.
6036988 6038447 All must be done as one.
6043203 6044871 Can't hurt.
6048416 6050501 If one fails...
6051294 6053004 <i>...all fail.</i>
6053505 6057175 At midnight, there is a shift change<br />in the security of both buildings.

6063682 6067644 - You count sheep at home.<br />- Why? I get paid to count them here.
6077821 6080031 Okay, they're inside.
6080198 6082700 - How much time?<br />- Twelve minutes.

6085412 6086496 Oh, shit.
6089874 6094374 All of our lives, we have fought this war.<br />Tonight, I believe we can end it.
6096840 6099008 <i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>
6100343 6102345 <i>There are no accidents.</i>
6103722 6108222 We have not come here by chance.<br />I do not believe in chance.
6108935 6113435 When I see three objectives,<br />three captains, three ships...
6114691 6118194 ...I do not see coincidence.<br />I see providence.
6118528 6120863 <i>I see purpose.</i>
6123575 6128075 I believe it is our fate to be here.<br />It is our destiny.
6130081 6134581 I believe this night holds<br />for each and every one of us...
6135253 6138589 ...the very meaning of our lives.
6138757 6142927 I want to ask you to do something,<br />but I don't know how.
6143511 6145429 I promise you, if I can, I will.
6146765 6150101 What if I asked you to stay out of this...
6151061 6153063 ...no matter what...
6153229 6155564 ...to stay out of the Matrix?
6156650 6158443 Why?
6166660 6167744 Please.
6169829 6171163 All right.
6174501 6177003 What is it, Niobe?
6177170 6181299 I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't<br />help thinking, what if you're wrong?
6181466 6184760 What if all this, the prophecy,<br />everything, is bullshit?
6184928 6188932 Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
6189349 6191976 But how would that be different<br />from any other day?
6201444 6205944 This is a war, and we are soldiers.
6208201 6211120 <i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>
6211663 6213456 <i>...in any place.</i>
6213623 6215541 Incoming. Incoming!

6225051 6227511 Now consider the alternative.
6227679 6232179 What if I am right?<br />What if the prophecy is true?
6232434 6236855 What if tomorrow the war could be over?
6237814 6240817 Isn't that worth fighting for?
6241943 6244570 Isn't that worth dying for?
6245488 6248115 - Time?<br />- Three minutes.
6248283 6249409 Almost there.

6269471 6270847 It is done.
6271014 6272306 Find the others.
6273433 6275685 I got Niobe there.<br />They're out of the station.
6275852 6278521 - What about Soren?<br />- There.
6278688 6280523 They're still inside, but...
6281399 6282441 They're not moving.

6310637 6312472 Call Neo now.
6316434 6319270 - I lost them. They're inside the portal.<br />- What about the grid?
6323399 6326902 Everything is operational.<br />The emergency system is rerouting power.
6332575 6334743 Jesus.
6334911 6338956 Soon as they open that door,<br />it's all over.

6349926 6352428 In five minutes,<br />I'll tear that building down.
6352595 6356140 - How much further?<br />- Here, just here.
6357433 6361437 I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
6362605 6365107 It's gotta be the ugliest hack<br />I have ever done.

6398349 6402849 Well, that's the difference between us.<br />I have been expecting you.
6403897 6406816 -What do you want, Smith?<br />SMITH: You haven't figured that out?

6505248 6507166 Come on.
6507750 6509626 Please.

6530189 6532149 <i>I don't believe it.</i>
6547707 6549834 It was meant to be.
6550001 6554501 Morpheus, that door will take you home.
6564140 6568477 You will know which door.<br />Hurry, Neo.
6573983 6577152 Trinity, I got some serious activity<br />headed your way.
6629455 6630831 Hello, Neo.
6631374 6635169 - Who are you?<br />- I am the Architect.
6635336 6638964 I created the Matrix.<br />I've been waiting for you.
6639215 6643385 You have many questions. Though the<br />process has altered your consciousness...
6643553 6645555 ...you remain irrevocably human.
6645721 6649307 Ergo, some of my answers you will<br />understand and some you will not.
6649725 6653770 Concordantly, while your first question<br />may be the most pertinent...
6653938 6657650 ...you may or may not realize<br />it is also the most irrelevant.
6658526 6660152 Why am I here?
6660319 6664239 Your life is the sum of a remainder<br />of an unbalanced equation...
6664407 6666742 ...inherent to the programming<br />of the Matrix.
6666909 6670996 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,<br />which despite my sincerest efforts...
6671164 6674000 ...I've been unable to eliminate<br />from what is otherwise...
6674167 6678629 ...a harmony of mathematical precision.
6678963 6681298 While it remains a burden<br />assiduously avoided...
6681465 6685927 ...it is not unexpected and thus<br />not beyond a measure of control...
6686095 6690057 ...which has led you, inexorably...
6691017 6692268 ...here.
6692435 6696522 - You haven't answered my question.<br />- Quite right.
6696689 6700484 Interesting.<br />That was quicker than the others.
6700651 6703278 NEOS: <i>Others? How many?<br />What others?</i>
6703446 6705948 The Matrix is older than you know.
6706115 6710119 I count from the emergence of one integral<br />anomaly to the emergence of the next.
6710286 6712538 In which case, this is the sixth version.
6712705 6715165 NEOS: <i>Five before me?<br />He's lying. Bullshit.</i>
6715333 6718878 <i>There are only two possible explanations.<br />There were five before me.</i>
6719045 6720337 <i>Either no one told me...</i>
6721589 6725593 - ...or no one knows.<br />- Precisely.
6725760 6729054 As you are undoubtedly gathering,<br />the anomaly is systemic...
6729222 6732642 ...creating fluctuations in even<br />the most simplistic equations.
6732808 6736061 <i>You can't control me!<br />I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>
6736229 6738022 <i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>
6738189 6741358 <i>You can't make me do anything.<br />You old, white prick!</i>
6743653 6745154 Choice.
6745321 6747156 The problem is choice.
6747698 6748740 [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
6769387 6773015 The first Matrix I designed<br />was naturally perfect, a work of art.
6773182 6775017 Flawless, sublime.
6775184 6778687 A triumph equaled only<br />by its monumental failure.
6779355 6781774 The inevitability of its doom<br />is apparent now...
6781941 6785277 ...as a consequence of the imperfection<br />inherent in every human.
6785444 6788405 Thus, I redesigned it<br />based on your history...
6788572 6792576 ...to more accurately reflect<br />the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
6793286 6797039 However, I was again frustrated<br />by failure.
6798499 6801126 I have come to understand<br />that the answer eluded me...
6801294 6803337 ...because it required a lesser mind.
6803504 6808004 Or perhaps, a mind less bound<br />by the parameters of perfection.
6809885 6814306 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon<br />by another, an intuitive program...
6814473 6818973 ...initially created to investigate<br />certain aspects of the human psyche.
6819437 6823937 If I am the father of the Matrix,<br />she would undoubtedly be its mother.
6826027 6828320 - The Oracle.<br />- Please.
6829030 6833034 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br />solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
6833200 6836077 ...accepted the program, as long as they<br />were given a choice...
6836245 6840374 ...even if they were only aware<br />of the choice at a near unconscious level.
6840541 6843961 While this answer functioned,<br />it was fundamentally flawed...
6844128 6848132 ...thus creating the otherwise<br />contradictory systemic anomaly...
6848299 6851010 ...that, if left unchecked,<br />might threaten the system.
6851385 6855514 Ergo, those that refused the program,<br />while a minority, if unchecked...
6855681 6859768 ...would constitute<br />an escalating probability of disaster.
6859935 6861728 This is about Zion.
6862188 6865858 You are here because Zion<br />is about to be destroyed.
6866025 6870446 Its every living inhabitant terminated,<br />its entire existence eradicated.
6870738 6871780 Bullshit.
6871947 6875116 Denial is the most predictable<br />of all human responses.
6875326 6879826 But rest assured, this will be<br />the sixth time we have destroyed it...
6881957 6885961 ...and we have become<br />exceedingly efficient at it.
6898682 6899974 The function of the One...
6900142 6904642 ...is now to return to the source, allowing<br />a dissemination of the code you carry...
6904980 6906690 ...reinserting the prime program.
6907274 6911278 After which you will be required to select<br />from the Matrix 23 individuals...
6911445 6914698 ...sixteen female, seven male,<br />to rebuild Zion.
6914865 6919365 Failure to comply with this process will<br />result in a cataclysmic system crash...
6919578 6921913 ...killing everyone connected<br />to the Matrix...
6922081 6924666 ...which, coupled with the<br />extermination of Zion...
6924834 6929046 ...will result in the extinction<br />of the entire human race.
6929380 6933467 You won't let it happen. You can't.<br />You need human beings to survive.
6934260 6937888 There are levels of survival<br />we are prepared to accept.
6938055 6940849 The relevant issue is<br />whether or not you are ready...
6941016 6944602 ...to accept the responsibility for the<br />death of every human being in this world.
6951068 6953612 It is interesting reading your reactions.
6954655 6958492 Your five predecessors were, by design,<br />based on a similar predication...
6958659 6963121 ...a contingent affirmation that was meant<br />to create a profound attachment...
6963289 6966875 ...to the rest of your species,<br />facilitating the function of the One.
6967042 6969377 While the others experience this<br />in a general way...
6969545 6972506 ...your experience is far more specific...
6972840 6975717 ...vis-à-vis love.
6976719 6978345 Trinity!
6980639 6984976 Apropos, she entered the Matrix<br />to save your life at the cost of her own.
6985352 6986394 No.
6987104 6991233 Which brings us at last to the moment<br />of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
6991400 6994486 ...is ultimately expressed<br />and the anomaly revealed...
6994653 6998657 ...as both beginning and end.
6998824 7000492 There are two doors.
7000659 7003870 The door to your right leads to the source<br />and the salvation of Zion.
7004455 7008955 The door to your left leads back to the<br />Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
7010920 7015299 As you adequately put,<br />the problem is choice.
7015466 7018969 But we already know what<br />you are going to do, don't we?
7019136 7023223 Already I can see the chain reaction,<br />the chemical precursors that signal...
7023390 7027890 ...the onset of an emotion designed<br />specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
7028812 7033312 An emotion that is already blinding you<br />from the simple and obvious truth:
7033609 7038109 She is going to die and there is nothing<br />you can do to stop it.
7045120 7049249 Hope. It is the quintessential<br />human delusion, simultaneously...
7049416 7053128 ...the source of your greatest strength<br />and your greatest weakness.
7053295 7057632 If I were you, I would hope<br />that we don't meet again.
7057800 7059218 We won't.
7066642 7068852 We got a serious situation, sir.
7069311 7070395 MORPHEUS:<br />Oh, no.
7106640 7109267 [RUMBLING]
7130039 7133584 MORPHEUS: What was that?<br />- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.
7184218 7186011 Holy shit, he caught her.
7191684 7194144 [TRINITY WHIMPERING]
7199942 7201777 Neo, I had to.
7201944 7203695 I know.
7208742 7211286 The bullet is still inside.
7218085 7219252 [YELLS]
7222047 7223965 Trinity...
7225175 7226885 ...don't you quit on me now.
7236061 7238646 I'm sorry.
7245154 7247447 NEO:<br />Trinity.
7257416 7259376 Trinity...
7259543 7261336 ...I know you can hear me.
7262129 7264673 I'm not letting go.
7264840 7266466 I can't.
7267676 7269886 I love you too damn much.
7298582 7299874 I can't take this.
7303629 7306715 I guess this makes us even.
7319394 7321354 I don't understand it.
7321522 7324525 Everything was done<br />as it was supposed to be done.
7324691 7327735 Once the One reaches the source,<br />the war should be over.
7327903 7330739 - In 24 hours, it will be.<br />- What?
7330906 7335243 If we don't do something in 24 hours,<br />Zion will be destroyed.
7335661 7337287 - What?<br />- How do you know that?
7337746 7339789 - I was told it would happen.<br />- By whom?
7340791 7343627 It doesn't matter. I believed him.
7343794 7347631 - That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...<br />- It was a lie, Morpheus.
7349383 7351927 The prophecy was a lie.
7353136 7356139 The One was never meant<br />to end anything.
7356306 7359350 It was all another system of control.
7359518 7362604 I don't believe that.
7362938 7365273 But you said it yourself.
7365440 7369444 How can the prophecy be true<br />if the war isn't over?
7375617 7378077 I'm sorry.
7378245 7381623 I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
7381790 7384959 ...I swear to you it's the truth.
7388171 7390882 - What are we gonna do?<br />- I don't know.
7391091 7392926 [ALARM WAILS]
7393093 7394302 Oh, no!
7403645 7406981 - What are they doing?<br />- They're just out of EMP range.
7407482 7408733 It's a bomb.
7409902 7412112 We have to get out of here. Now.
7448815 7450691 I have dreamed a dream...
7453737 7457115 ...but now that dream<br />has gone from me.
7468168 7470420 Here they come.
7470671 7472381 Let's go, Morpheus.
7473799 7476843 - We won't make it.<br />- We have to try.
7484559 7487562 - Come on!<br />- Something's different.
7487729 7489731 What?
7490399 7491900 I can feel them.
7514840 7516424 Neo!
7522597 7526183 - What happened?<br />- I don't know.
7528061 7530521 [RUMBLING]
7531440 7533358 It's the <i>Hammer.</i>
7545037 7547748 WOMAN:<br />He's in some kind of coma...
7547914 7550166 ...but his vitals are stable.
7551376 7553294 What about you?
7553462 7555589 I'm fine.
7555756 7558133 You could use some rest.
7558300 7560135 No, I'm gonna stay with him.
7567225 7569852 Lock was right.<br />He guessed that the machines...
7570020 7572897 ...would cut <i>off</i> the mainlines<br />in and out of Zion.
7573065 7575817 He thought a counterattack<br />might surprise them.
7576068 7579488 It sounded good.<br />I figured we had a shot...
7579821 7582365 ...until someone screwed it up.
7582532 7585159 An EMP was triggered before<br />we got in position.
7585327 7587203 Five ships were instantly downed.
7587370 7589163 MAN:<br />When the machines broke through...
7589331 7592542 ...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
7592709 7595545 Was it an accident?<br />Some sort of malfunction?
7595712 7598172 - No one knows.<br />- Someone does.
7598340 7600091 Who?
7600258 7603970 Once the machines were done with us,<br />they started digging again.
7604137 7606430 We made a quick pass<br />to look for survivors.
7606640 7607724 You found one?
7609476 7611186 Only one.
8204278 8207572 WOMAN:<br /><i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>
8207740 8209450 <i>...has an end.</i>
8211869 8214746 <i>I see the end coming.</i>
8214914 8218709 <i>I see the darkness spreading.<br />I see death.</i>
8220837 8223840 Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
8224006 8226008 We missed you.
8226175 8228010 It ends tonight.
8232682 8234308 [THUNDER ROLLING]
8235226 8238354 WOMAN:<br /><i>You are all that stands in his way.</i>
8239939 8244439 <i>If you cannot stop him tonight,<br />then I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
