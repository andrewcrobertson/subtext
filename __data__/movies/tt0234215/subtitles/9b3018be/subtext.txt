87337 89171 See you tomorrow.
108483 109525 Oh, my God!
132173 133674 I'm in.
246788 248580 We're almost there.
248748 252709 - Sir, are you sure about this?<br />- I told you, we're going to be all right.
252877 258340 I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping<br />some serious sentinel activity up here.
296504 298922 - Link.<br />- Yes, sir?
299090 302217 Given your situation, I can't say<br />I understand your reasons ...
302385 305053 ... for volunteering to operate<br />onboard my ship.
305221 309224 However, if you wish to continue to<br />do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
309767 311226 What's that, sir?
311978 313270 To trust me.
313438 315397 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
317442 320610 - I mean, I do, sir.<br />- I hope so.
320778 324156 Re-patch the main AC to the hard drives<br />and stand by to broadcast.
324324 325407 Yes, sir.
334250 336501 Still can't sleep?
338463 339838 You wanna talk?
342175 344551 They're just dreams.
346888 349264 If you're afraid of something ... .
349432 351266 I just wish ... .
351934 354186 I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
354354 356188 That's all.
357106 358690 I just wish I knew.
358858 363111 She's gonna call. Don't worry.
363279 364321 Here you are.
364489 367949 - Are we ready to go?<br />- We're already late.
368117 372746 These geotherms confirm<br />the last transmission of the Osiris.
373498 375165 The machines are digging.
376834 379127 They're boring from the surface<br />down to Zion.
379295 381880 - Mother --<br />- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
382048 383548 How fast are they moving?
383716 387094 Control estimates their descent<br />at 100 meters an hour.
387261 389721 - How deep are they?<br />- Almost 2,000 meters.
389889 393433 - What about the scans from the Osiris?<br />- They can't be accurate.
393601 395519 - They may be.<br />- It's not possible.
395686 398146 That'd mean there are<br />a quarter-million sentinels.
398314 399815 - That's right.<br />- That can't be.
399982 401650 Why not?
401818 405570 A sentinel for every man,<br />woman and child in Zion.
406531 410492 That sounds exactly like<br />the thinking of a machine to me.
410660 412828 Morpheus, glad you could join us.
413329 414496 Niobe.
415873 419251 My apologies to all.<br />But as you are undoubtedly aware ...
419419 422712 ... it's become difficult to locate<br />a secure broadcast position.
422880 426133 - Squiddies got our best spots.<br />- Lines are crawling with them.
426300 430095 And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours<br />there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
430263 431388 What are we gonna do?
431556 433849 We're gonna do what<br />Commander Lock ordered.
434183 436768 We'll evacuate broadcast level<br />and return to Zion.
436936 442065 And does the commander have a plan<br />for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
442233 444901 A strategy is still being formulated.
445069 446736 I'm sure it is.
461752 463753 What do you think<br />we should do, Morpheus?
463963 466089 -Proceed as ordered ...<br />-What is - t?
466257 467299 I don't know.
467467 470260 ... however, I must<br />ask one of you for help.
470428 476141 Some of you believe as I believe, some<br />of you do not. Those of you that do ...
476309 478852 ... know we are nearing<br />the end of our struggle.
479020 483273 The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.<br />But before it can be ...
483441 486776 ... the Oracle must be consulted.
494702 496953 If we return and recharge now ...
497121 500874 ... we can be back in 36 hours, well<br />before the machines reach this depth.
501083 502918 Do you understand what you're asking?
503085 505921 I am asking that one ship<br />remain here in our place ...
506088 508798 ... in case the Oracle<br />should attempt to contact us.
508966 512093 Bullshit. You're asking one of us<br />to disobey a direct order.
512261 516806 That's right, I am. But we well know<br />that the reason most of us are here ...
516974 519601 ... is because of our affinity<br />for disobedience.
519769 521686 What happens when you<br />get back to Zion ...
521854 524272 ... and the commander<br />throws you in the stockade?
524440 525649 He won't.
526776 529986 Goddamn it, Morpheus,<br />you ain't never gonna change.
530696 533448 Shit, I'll do it just to see<br />what Deadbolt does to you.
533616 535158 You got 36 hours.
537954 539788 I'm looking for Neo.
539956 543333 -Never heard of him.<br />- I have something for him.
544544 546753 A gift.
546963 549839 You see, he set me free.
552134 554511 Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
555054 556096 Who was that?
556264 558098 How did you know someone was here?
558266 559724 He gave you this.
565481 566898 He said you set him free.
568859 571194 Is everything all right, sir?
571821 574197 The meeting is over.<br />Retreat to your exits.
574365 576575 - Agents are coming.<br />- Agents?
577034 578410 Go.
588212 589296 Hiya, fellas.
589463 590589 - It's him.<br />- The anomaly.
590756 592007 - Do we proceed?<br />- Yes.
592174 594676 - He is still --<br />- Only human.
600850 603101 Hm. Upgrades.
658032 660575 - That went as expected.<br />- Yes.
660743 663411 It's happening exactly as before.
663579 666247 Well, not exactly.
669960 672087 - What happened?<br />- I can't figure it out.
672254 673922 Agents just came out of nowhere.
674090 677092 Then the code got all weird.<br />Encryption I've never seen.
677259 680178 - Is Neo okay?<br />- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
680346 681763 Where is he now?
683224 684974 He's doing his Superman thing.
734942 736401 Where are you?
741073 744659 This is the Nebuchadnezzar,<br />requesting access through Gate Three.
748706 753168 Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.<br />Maintain present velocity and stand by.
753335 754836 Roger that, Control.
755004 758506 This is Control requesting immediate<br />stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
759300 762510 We have the Nebuchadnezzar<br />on approach. Let's open her up.
768100 771019 You are cleared through<br />Gate Three to Bay Seven.
771187 772896 Roger that, Control.
780029 783114 Door's open, bed's made.<br />Welcome home.
783866 786034 No place like it.
800216 803927 Roger that, Control. Zion Control,<br />stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
853435 855854 The Nebuchadnezzar is down.<br />Bay Seven.
856021 857188 Understood.
867157 868449 Captain Mifune.
869535 870702 Captain Morpheus.
870870 873705 Are you here to escort me<br />to the stockade, captain?
873873 876249 - I'm just here to keep the peace.<br />- Commander Lock demands --
878544 881713 Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
882631 884465 - Link.<br />- Sir?
884633 887218 I want the ship ready to go<br />as soon as possible.
887386 888928 Understood, sir.
896103 898521 - What is it between them?<br />- Morpheus and Lock?
899648 901816 - Niobe.<br />- Captain Niobe?
901984 905194 She used to be with Morpheus.<br />Now she's with Lock.
906447 908031 What happened?
908240 911659 Morpheus went to the Oracle.<br />After that, everything changed.
911827 914495 Yeah, she can do that.
914663 915830 Neo!
916832 919709 - Oh, no.<br />- How does he always know?
919877 921836 Doesn't he have anything better to do?
922004 924714 You know what they say<br />about the life you save.
924882 926674 I didn't save his life.
928844 930219 Hiya, Neo.
931388 934015 - Trinity, Link.<br />- Hey.
934183 937852 - It's great to have you back.<br />- Thanks. It's good to be back.
938020 940772 - Can I carry that for you?<br />- No, I can carry my own bag.
940940 942607 - Trinity?<br />- I'm fine.
943567 946444 - You can carry these.<br />- Yeah, sure, Link.
951367 955870 Hey, you know, next year<br />I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
956038 958790 I've been thinking about it,<br />and I've made my decision.
958958 960416 Let me guess.
960918 962877 I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
963879 967423 Morpheus hasn't filled the other<br />positions, except for you, Link.
967591 968967 I'm sure he has reasons ...
969134 972470 ... but the more I think about it,<br />the more I think it's meant to be.
972638 974180 You know, it's fate.
974348 975890 You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
976058 978601 I told you, you found me.<br />I didn't find you.
978769 981312 I know, but you got me out.<br />You saved me.
982439 984065 You saved yourself.
1000374 1003668 - Morpheus.<br />- Commander Lock.
1003919 1008423 I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to<br />offer you a chance to explain your actions.
1008590 1011467 I wasn't aware that my actions<br />required any explanation.
1011635 1013928 You were given an order<br />to return to Zion.
1014096 1016931 - I did.<br />- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
1017099 1019767 I would have stayed,<br />but I needed to recharge my ship.
1019935 1022645 So you admit to a direct contravention<br />of your duty.
1022813 1026232 We need a presence inside the Matrix<br />to await contact from the Oracle.
1026400 1028359 I don't want to hear that shit!
1028527 1031195 I don't care about oracles<br />or prophecies or messiahs!
1031363 1034782 I care about one thing: Stopping that<br />army from destroying this city.
1034950 1037785 To do that I need soldiers<br />to obey my orders.
1037953 1042540 With all due respect, commander,<br />there is only one way to save our city.
1042708 1044125 How?
1044293 1047086 - Neo.<br />- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
1047254 1049881 Not everyone believes what you believe.
1050049 1052133 My beliefs do not require them to.
1060309 1064228 There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's<br />talking. A lot of people are scared.
1064396 1067148 No one remembers the last time<br />so many ships were docked.
1067316 1070276 - Something big is happening, isn't it?<br />- Hey.
1070444 1073613 We're not allowed to say anything,<br />so stop asking.
1078911 1082038 Goddamn, it's good to be home.
1095052 1098012 I'm recommending that you<br />be removed from duty.
1098180 1100515 That is, of course,<br />your prerogative, commander.
1100682 1104560 If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot<br />on a ship for the rest of your life.
1104728 1107480 Then I am grateful that<br />it is not up to you.
1113946 1116364 - Councillor Hamann.<br />- Commander.
1117032 1119742 - Captain.<br />- Councillor.
1119910 1123287 Council's asked me to speak tonight<br />at the temple gathering.
1123455 1127542 The presence of the fleet and the<br />persistence of rumors must be addressed.
1127709 1130211 The people must be told<br />what is happening.
1130379 1132088 Of course, councillor.
1132798 1138052 But might I advise a level of discretion<br />concerning specific details.
1138220 1141222 - We do not wish to start a panic.<br />- Quite right.
1141390 1144475 A panic is not what anyone wants.
1144643 1147979 What about you, captain?<br />What would you advise?
1150399 1155153 The truth. No one will panic,<br />because there is nothing to fear.
1155320 1157446 That army won't reach<br />the gates of Zion.
1158240 1161826 - What makes you so sure?<br />- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
1161994 1163870 Consider that in the past six months ...
1164037 1166080 ... we have freed more minds<br />than in six years.
1166248 1169250 This attack is an act of desperation.
1169418 1173254 I believe very soon the prophecy<br />will be fulfilled and this war will end.
1175132 1177258 I hope you're right, captain.
1177426 1180136 I do not believe it to be<br />a matter of hope, councillor.
1180304 1182889 It is simply a matter of time.
1185058 1186517 My stop.
1186685 1188102 See you soon.
1188270 1189729 Hopefully not too soon.
1189897 1193065 Let's go, kid.<br />These two got things to do.
1202492 1204243 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1204411 1206829 I am if you're thinking<br />this elevator is too slow.
1206997 1210333 - How long do we charge the Neb?<br />- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
1210500 1214712 Some people go their entire lives<br />without hearing news that good.
1239154 1243491 Neo, please, I have a son,<br />Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
1243659 1247161 - Please, watch over him.<br />- I'll try.
1247329 1249413 I have a daughter on the Icarus.
1250207 1251499 No, wait.
1251667 1254168 It's all right. They need you.
1254336 1256587 - I need you.<br />- I know.
1257130 1259423 There's time.
1264388 1266514 Where's my puss --?
1266682 1269016 - Hey!<br />- Uncle Link!
1269184 1270810 God!
1270978 1272937 Uncle Link!
1273105 1276691 Oh, my God! You're so huge!
1276858 1279026 - You should be picking me up!<br />- No!
1279194 1280736 - Yeah!<br />- Okay!
1280904 1282613 Okay? All right.
1282781 1285825 Now, we're gonna have<br />to work together here, okay?
1285993 1288202 One, two, three, lift!
1288370 1291539 Oh, my God!<br />What are you feeding these two?
1291707 1294417 Come on, kids. It's time to go.
1296211 1297545 - Hey, Cas.<br />- Hey.
1298088 1300631 - Good to have you home, Link.<br />- Good to be home.
1300799 1302633 You be careful with her.
1302801 1305594 Don't worry about me.<br />He's the one that's gonna get it.
1307431 1309807 Out the door! Both of you, march!
1309975 1312018 - Bye!<br />- Bye!
1318400 1319942 I'm gonna get what?
1321236 1325323 Every ship up there's been home two, even<br />three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
1325490 1329327 Come on, Zee.<br />I thought we were past this.
1329494 1332913 - We'll be when you operate another ship.<br />- I can't do that.
1333081 1334582 - Why?<br />- You know why.
1334750 1337918 If Dozer knew how I felt,<br />he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
1338628 1341172 Maybe. But it's too late now.
1341340 1343966 I made a promise,<br />and some promises can't be unmade.
1344134 1346844 - It's not fair.<br />- Nobody said it was gonna be.
1347012 1349972 You think Cas thinks it's fair<br />that I'm here and Dozer's not?
1355896 1359106 I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
1360192 1362401 I'm afraid of it.
1363987 1366614 I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
1367282 1369116 It won't.
1369284 1371118 How can you say that to me?
1371286 1373245 Because of Morpheus.
1373413 1378042 Because of what he's told me. He said<br />that this is it, that it will be over soon.
1378210 1382421 - Link, Morpheus is crazy.<br />- No doubt.
1382923 1386133 But Tank and Dozer believed him.<br />And I'll tell you what ...
1386301 1391639 ... after being on that ship and seeing Neo<br />do the things he can do, I gotta say ...
1391807 1393849 ... I'm starting to believe him too.
1398980 1401399 Be careful, Link.
1406738 1409115 Please be careful.
1418208 1421627 - They started yet?<br />- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
1421795 1424880 Tonight, let us honor<br />these men and women.
1425048 1427675 These are our soldiers, our warriors.
1427843 1432096 These are our husbands and wives,<br />our brothers and sisters ...
1432264 1433931 ... our children.
1434516 1437643 Let us remember those<br />that have been lost ...
1437811 1441021 ... and let us give thanks<br />for those that have been found ...
1441189 1444483 ... and who stand here beside us.
1444693 1448362 Now I would like someone else<br />to close this prayer ...
1448530 1451740 ... someone who hasn't spoken here<br />in a long time ...
1451908 1457288 ... but who I believe has something to say<br />that we all need to hear.
1458290 1459874 I give you Morpheus.
1479394 1483564 Zion! Hear me!
1484566 1487693 It is true what many of you have heard.
1487861 1491864 The machines have gathered<br />an army, and as I speak ...
1492032 1495951 ... that army is drawing nearer to our home.
1497412 1502082 Believe me when I say we have<br />a difficult time ahead of us.
1502751 1508923 But if we are to be prepared for it,<br />we must first shed our fear of it.
1509424 1514345 I stand here before you now<br />truthfully unafraid.
1514930 1516680 Why?
1517098 1519934 Because I believe something you do not?
1520101 1521936 No!
1522229 1527191 I stand here without fear<br />because I remember.
1527359 1531278 I remember that I am here not because<br />of the path that lies before me ...
1531446 1534782 ... but because of the path<br />that lies behind me.
1534950 1539620 I remember that for 100 years<br />we have fought these machines.
1539788 1544542 I remember that for 100 years<br />they have sent their armies to destroy us.
1544709 1550798 And after a century of war,<br />I remember that which matters most:
1551675 1554677 We are still here!
1561393 1563477 Tonight ...
1563645 1567022 ... let us send a message to that army.
1567190 1570234 Tonight, let us shake this cave.
1570402 1574280 Tonight, let us tremble these halls ...
1574447 1577575 ... of earth, steel and stone.
1577742 1582997 Let us be heard from red core<br />to black sky.
1583164 1587710 Tonight, let us make them remember:
1587877 1592840 This is Zion and we are not afraid!
1616197 1618198 I remember.
1619034 1621452 I remember you used to dance.
1623079 1626373 I remember you were pretty good.
1627125 1630377 There are some things in this world,<br />Captain Niobe ...
1631171 1633964 ... that will never change.
1635258 1637176 Niobe!
1641890 1643641 Some things do change.
1662911 1664745 Excuse me.
1676591 1680094 - I missed you.<br />- I can tell.
1680553 1684264 I was thinking, everyone is here.
1684808 1687101 Follow me.
1888094 1891680 Neo, what is it?
1891973 1894224 What's wrong?
1895810 1898145 It's okay, you can tell me.
1898521 1901023 Trinity ... .
1901190 1903984 Don't be afraid.
1904152 1906486 I can't lose you.
1906654 1908530 You're not gonna lose me.
1912660 1915537 You feel this?
1915705 1917497 I'm never letting go.
1954702 1957371 Good night, Zion.
1957538 1960207 Sweet dreams.
1970385 1972052 - You all right?<br />- I'll make it.
1972220 1974846 Did you see that agent?<br />I've never seen anything like that.
1975014 1977099 It doesn't matter.<br />All that matters is this.
1977266 1979559 You first.
1990446 1993323 - Oh, God.<br />- "Smith" will suffice.
2005253 2008547 - Thank you.<br />- My pleasure.
2058514 2061808 - Care for some company?<br />- Councillor Hamann.
2062685 2065520 I don't want to intrude<br />if you'd prefer to be alone.
2065980 2069524 - No, I could probably use some company.<br />- Good.
2069984 2072360 So could I.
2075490 2077991 It's nice tonight.
2078493 2080911 Very calm.
2081079 2083830 It feels like everyone is sleeping<br />very peacefully.
2084207 2086666 Not everyone.
2086959 2091671 I hate sleeping.<br />I never sleep more than a few hours.
2091839 2095884 I figure I slept the first 11 years<br />of my life, now I'm making up for it.
2096344 2101056 - What about you?<br />- I just haven't been able to sleep much.
2102517 2105685 - It's a good sign.<br />- Of what?
2105853 2109022 That you are in fact still human.
2112610 2116530 Have you ever been<br />to the engineering level?
2116697 2119741 I love to walk there at night.<br />It's quite amazing.
2119909 2122452 - Would you like to see it?<br />- Sure.
2133131 2137592 Almost no one comes down here.<br />Unless, of course, there's a problem.
2137760 2142848 That's how it is with people. Nobody cares<br />how it works as long as it works.
2143015 2145308 I like it down here.
2145476 2151273 I like to be reminded this city survives<br />because of these machines.
2151440 2156570 These machines are keeping us alive<br />while other machines are coming to kill us.
2156988 2161825 Interesting, isn't it?<br />The power to give life ...
2161993 2165203 ... and the power to end it.<br />- We have the same power.
2165371 2168081 Yeah, I suppose we do, but ...
2168249 2171710 ... sometimes I think about those people<br />still plugged into the Matrix.
2171878 2174880 And when I look at these machines ...
2175047 2180135 ... I can't help thinking that, in a way,<br />we are plugged into them.
2180428 2183305 But we control these machines,<br />they don't control us.
2183723 2186725 Of course not. How could they?
2186893 2189436 The idea is pure nonsense ...
2189937 2193064 ... but it does make one wonder just ...
2193232 2194816 ... what is control?
2195067 2198111 If we wanted, we could<br />shut these machines down.
2198487 2202949 Of course. That's it. You hit it.<br />That's control, isn't it?
2203576 2206953 If we wanted,<br />we could smash them to bits.
2207205 2211333 Although if we did, we'd have to consider<br />what would happen to our lights ...
2211500 2214169 ... our heat, our air.
2215171 2219299 So we need machines and they need us.<br />Is that your point, councillor?
2219467 2222093 No. No point.
2222803 2226890 Old men like me don't bother<br />with making points. There's no point.
2227683 2231478 Is that why there are no young men<br />on the Council?
2231646 2233313 Good point.
2234023 2238193 Why don't you tell me<br />what's on your mind, councillor.
2238361 2241613 There is so much in this world ...
2241781 2244699 ... that I do not understand.
2246494 2251248 See that machine? It has something to do<br />with recycling our water supply.
2251415 2254417 I have absolutely no idea how it works.
2254585 2258672 But I do understand the reason<br />for it to work.
2260174 2264678 I have absolutely no idea how you<br />are able to do some of the things you do.
2265846 2269015 But I believe there's a reason for that<br />as well.
2269892 2275021 I only hope we understand that reason<br />before it's too late.
2281529 2283196 - Ballard.<br />- Is he here?
2285616 2288201 Neo, it's from the Oracle.
2291163 2292872 It's time to go.
2293833 2296293 Morpheus said this was how<br />it was gonna happen.
2296460 2300880 I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,<br />maybe it's not.
2301424 2304592 All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
2306178 2308054 Right now, that operator's me.
2308681 2310765 I know.
2315730 2317397 - Zee ... .<br />- I want you to wear it.
2317565 2320650 - You know I don't believe in this stuff.<br />- But I do.
2320943 2323903 It's always brought me luck.
2324071 2328199 - Maybe it'll bring me you.<br />- I'm coming back.
2328367 2332912 I promise. No matter what it takes,<br />I'm coming home.
2333622 2337250 Just keep it with you. Please.
2337418 2339502 For me.
2341922 2344215 Okay.
2363694 2365862 - Neo!<br />- How the hell --?
2366280 2368448 Bane.
2368616 2369949 Is something wrong?
2370117 2371826 No, I'm fine.
2371994 2374788 I just wanted to catch you to say ...
2374955 2376790 ... good luck.
2378459 2380168 Thanks.
2380336 2382754 We'll see you.
2384340 2387425 Neo! Just in time.
2387593 2389928 - You're gonna see the Oracle?<br />- There's no time.
2390096 2391721 I had to give something to Neo.
2392431 2395141 A gift from one of the orphans.
2395309 2398728 He made me swear to get it to you<br />before you left.
2399605 2402065 He said you'd understand.
2404735 2406861 Thanks.
2413953 2416871 I was just told you cleared<br />the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
2417039 2418998 That is correct.
2419166 2421126 Am I still in charge<br />of our defense system?
2421293 2422585 Of course.
2423295 2427340 I believe I need every ship we have<br />if we're going to survive this attack.
2427925 2430093 I understand that, commander.
2430261 2432846 Then why did you allow<br />the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
2433013 2437892 Because I believe our survival depends<br />on more than how many ships we have.
2440396 2442689 Be careful.
2471719 2473928 Hello.
2484231 2487775 - You seek the Oracle.<br />- Who are you?
2490821 2495325 I am Seraph. I can take you to her,<br />but first I must apologize.
2495576 2497285 Apologize for what?
2497953 2499746 For this.
2557054 2559305 Good.
2561809 2564978 The Oracle has many enemies.<br />I had to be sure.
2565145 2567355 - Of what?<br />- That you are the One.
2567815 2571568 - You could have just asked.<br />- No. You do not truly know someone ...
2571735 2573987 ... until you fight them.
2574530 2577991 Come. She's waiting.
2593048 2594924 Where the hell did they go?
2595301 2598011 These are back doors, aren't they?
2598178 2601097 Programmer access.
2602182 2605935 - How do they work?<br />- A code is hidden in tumblers.
2606103 2611107 One position opens a lock and another<br />position opens one of these doors.
2612860 2615695 Are you a programmer?
2615863 2618197 Then what are you?
2620367 2623870 I protect that which matters most.
2643390 2646768 Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
2647186 2649979 Come around here<br />and let me have a look at you.
2653192 2655568 My goodness, look at you.
2655903 2658738 You turned out all right, didn't you?
2658906 2661115 How do you feel?
2661283 2664869 I know you're not sleeping.<br />We'll get to that.
2665037 2667747 Why don't you come<br />and have a sit this time.
2668457 2672585 - Maybe I'll stand.<br />- Well, suit yourself.
2683722 2686265 - I felt like sitting.<br />- I know.
2687434 2689352 So ...
2691438 2693856 ... let's get the obvious stuff<br />out of the way.
2694149 2698611 - You're not human, are you?<br />- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
2698779 2704617 If I had to guess, I'd say you're<br />a program from the machine world.
2704993 2709205 - So is he.<br />- So far, so good.
2709373 2712542 But if that's true, that could mean<br />you're part of this system ...
2712710 2715294 ... another kind of control.
2715462 2719966 - Keep going.<br />- I suppose the most obvious question is ...
2720134 2724053 ... how can I trust you?<br />- Bingo.
2725097 2728349 It is a pickle, no doubt about it.<br />Bad news is ...
2728517 2732186 ... there's no way you can really know<br />if I'm here to help you or not.
2732354 2735898 So it's really up to you. Just have<br />to make up your own damn mind ...
2736066 2740862 ... to either accept what<br />I'm going to tell you or reject it.
2742156 2744323 Candy?
2747035 2751456 - Do you already know if I'll take it?<br />- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
2751623 2754834 But if you already know,<br />how can I make a choice?
2755002 2759046 Because you didn't come here to make<br />the choice. You've already made it.
2759214 2763843 You're here to try to understand<br />why you made it.
2769391 2772351 I thought you'd have figured that out<br />by now.
2774104 2776689 - Why are you here?<br />- Same reason.
2776940 2779692 I love candy.
2779860 2782695 But why help us?
2782863 2786365 We're all here to do<br />what we're all here to do.
2786909 2789994 I'm interested in one thing, Neo:<br />the future.
2790162 2794373 And believe me, I know, the only way<br />to get there is together.
2795209 2800129 - Are there other programs like you?<br />- Well, not like me, but ... .
2800297 2802965 Look. See those birds?
2803217 2806594 At some point, a program was written<br />to govern them.
2806762 2812600 A program was written to watch over the<br />trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
2812851 2815728 There are programs running<br />all over the place.
2815896 2820358 The ones doing their job, doing what<br />they were meant to do, are invisible.
2820526 2824362 You'd never even know they were here.<br />But the other ones ... .
2824530 2828616 Well, you hear about them all the time.
2829201 2832078 - I've never heard of them.<br />- Of course you have.
2832246 2837166 Every time you've heard someone<br />say they saw a ghost or an angel ...
2837334 2841921 ... every story you've ever heard about<br />vampires, werewolves or aliens ...
2842089 2844423 ... is the system assimilating<br />some program ...
2844591 2849262 ... that's doing something<br />they're not supposed to be doing.
2849429 2852431 Programs hacking programs.
2852599 2855476 - Why?<br />- They have their reasons ...
2855644 2859605 ... but usually a program chooses exile<br />when it faces deletion.
2860023 2863943 - And why would a program be deleted?<br />- Maybe it breaks down.
2864111 2868656 Maybe a better program is created<br />to replace it. Happens all the time.
2868824 2873786 And when it does, a program<br />can either choose to hide here ...
2873954 2876622 ... or return to the source.
2878292 2881586 - The machine mainframe.<br />- Yes.
2881753 2884255 Where you must go.
2884423 2888634 Where the path of the One ends.<br />You've seen it ...
2889803 2892638 ... in your dreams, haven't you?
2892806 2895641 A door made of light?
2897895 2901439 What happens when you go through<br />the door?
2903567 2906569 I see Trinity ...
2906737 2909906 ... and something happens ...
2910073 2911991 ... something bad.
2912159 2916162 She starts to fall,<br />and then I wake up.
2917205 2921083 - Do you see her die?<br />- No.
2921877 2924921 You have the sight now, Neo.
2925088 2928090 You are looking at the world<br />without time.
2928258 2930676 Then why can't I see<br />what happens to her?
2930844 2934597 We can never see past the choices<br />we don't understand.
2934765 2937934 Are you saying I have to choose<br />whether Trinity lives or dies?
2938185 2941979 No, you've already made the choice.
2942147 2944690 Now you have to understand it.
2945317 2946692 No.
2946860 2950112 I can't do that. I won't.
2950822 2953199 - Well, you have to.<br />- Why?
2953784 2956869 Because you're the One.
2959039 2962041 What if I can't?
2962209 2964210 What happens if I fail?
2964795 2967797 Then Zion will fall.
2975263 2980142 Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.<br />You can save Zion ...
2980310 2983646 ... if you reach the source, but to do that<br />you need the Keymaker.
2983814 2984855 The Keymaker?
2985023 2988609 He disappeared. We didn't<br />know what happened to him until now.
2988777 2992530 He's being held prisoner<br />by a very dangerous program ...
2992698 2996242 ... one of the oldest of us.<br />He is called the Merovingian.
2996410 2999286 - And he won't let him go willingly.<br />- What does he want?
2999454 3004291 What do all men with power want?<br />More power.
3005002 3008254 Be there at that exact time ...
3008422 3011090 ... and you will have a chance.
3011883 3014135 We must go.
3014302 3019682 Seems like every time we meet<br />I got nothing but bad news.
3020267 3023144 I'm sorry about that. I surely am.
3023311 3026063 But for what it's worth ...
3027107 3030776 ... you've made a believer out of me.
3032070 3034196 Good luck, kiddo.
3058138 3060139 Did you get my package?
3060307 3062475 - Yeah.<br />- Well, good.
3063643 3066520 - Smith?<br />- He's not reading like an agent.
3066688 3070566 - Surprised to see me?<br />- No.
3070859 3073319 - Then you're aware of it.<br />- Of what?
3074529 3076530 Our connection.
3076698 3079366 I don't fully understand how it happened.
3079534 3082912 Perhaps some part of you<br />imprinted onto me ...
3083080 3085748 ... something overwritten or copied.
3085916 3088626 It is, at this point, irrelevant.<br />What matters is ...
3088794 3091879 ... that whatever happened,<br />happened for a reason.
3092047 3093714 And what reason is that?
3094174 3098135 I killed you, Mr. Anderson.<br />I watched you die.
3098303 3101555 With a certain satisfaction,<br />I might add.
3101723 3105226 And then something happened,<br />something that I knew was impossible ...
3105393 3107228 ... but it happened anyway.
3107938 3111107 You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
3113110 3117696 Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood<br />what I was supposed to do ...
3117864 3120866 ... but I didn't.
3121284 3125204 I couldn't. I was compelled to stay ...
3125664 3129208 ... compelled to disobey.
3129793 3133546 And now, here I stand<br />because of you, Mr. Anderson.
3133713 3137675 Because of you, I'm no longer an agent<br />of this system.
3137843 3141053 Because of you, I've changed.<br />I'm unplugged.
3141221 3146058 A new man, so to speak.<br />Like you, apparently free.
3146393 3147768 Congratulations.
3148520 3150855 Thank you.
3151439 3156068 But as you well know,<br />appearances can be deceiving ...
3156236 3161407 ... which brings me back to the reason<br />why we're here.
3161575 3166453 We're not here because we're free.<br />We're here because we are not free.
3166621 3170541 There's no escaping reason,<br />no denying purpose.
3170709 3174086 Because as we both know,<br />without purpose ...
3174254 3179091 ... we would not exist.<br />- It is purpose that created us.
3179259 3182261 - Purpose that connects us.<br />- Purpose that pulls us.
3182429 3184263 - That guides us.<br />- That drives us.
3184431 3189143 - It is purpose that defines.<br />- Purpose that binds us.
3189311 3191770 We are here because of you,<br />Mr. Anderson.
3191938 3196317 We're here to take from you<br />what you tried to take from us:
3198278 3200362 Purpose.
3203450 3205326 - What's happening to him?<br />- Don't know.
3208371 3211957 Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
3318815 3321275 - You.<br />- Yes, me.
3325447 3328324 Me, me, me.
3333204 3334872 Me too.
3462625 3463667 More.
3525939 3528774 It is inevitable.
3529192 3530609 Come on, get out of there.
3573820 3576154 Are you all right?
3577240 3579157 - It was Smith.<br />- Yes.
3580034 3582661 - Now there's more than one?<br />- A lot more.
3582829 3586623 - How is that possible?<br />- I don't know.
3586791 3589251 Somehow, he's found a way<br />to copy himself.
3589419 3593630 - Is that what he was doing to you?<br />- I don't know what he was doing ...
3593798 3596550 ... but I know what it felt like.<br />- What?
3597468 3601179 It felt like I was back in that hallway.
3601347 3602764 It felt like dying.
3603266 3606143 The machines are tunneling to avoid<br />our defense system.
3606311 3610147 But I believe they will intersect<br />certain pipelines to control them.
3610315 3612858 These points of intersection<br />are crucial ...
3613026 3615819 ... because I believe they're<br />vulnerable to counterattack.
3615987 3620032 Although it has been suggested that<br />this is the same kind of attack ...
3620199 3623869 ... we've defended for years,<br />I urge the Council to realize the truth.
3624037 3627372 This is the single greatest threat<br />we have ever faced ...
3627540 3631376 ... and if we do not act accordingly,<br />we will not survive.
3631544 3635547 Commander Lock, the Council is well<br />aware of the seriousness of this attack.
3635840 3640385 You have our leave to prepare our defense<br />by any and all means necessary.
3640553 3643221 - Thank you, Council.<br />- However ...
3643473 3646808 ... we ask if there's been word<br />from the Nebuchadnezzar.
3647060 3649561 No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
3651189 3655150 Then we request a ship be dispatched<br />to ascertain the fate of the One.
3655318 3659071 I wish that were possible, councillor,<br />but I do not believe our defense ...
3659238 3662783 ... can suffer the loss of another ship.<br />- It will, commander, if it must.
3662950 3665285 It could take one ship days<br />to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
3665453 3668497 -Then send two.<br />- This is insane.
3668665 3671667 Careful, commander.
3671876 3675212 Forgive my frustration, councillors.
3675380 3679257 But I wish I were able to comprehend<br />the Council's choice in this matter.
3679425 3682594 Comprehension is not<br />a requisite of cooperation.
3682762 3685222 If you are asking me<br />to order two of my captains --
3685390 3687099 There's no need for such an order.
3687266 3690811 The captains are present.<br />They can answer for themselves.
3691270 3696525 The Council is calling for two volunteers<br />to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
3696693 3700862 Are there two among you<br />that would answer such a call?
3702156 3705951 Captain Soren of the Vigilant<br />will answer the Council's call.
3706119 3709037 You understand the situation,<br />Captain Soren?
3709205 3711665 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Thank you, captain.
3713084 3714501 Is there another?
3715294 3719005 - Captain, I think we should volunteer.<br />- What? You have gone crazy.
3719173 3721049 - Listen --<br />- Shut your hole, Bane ...
3721217 3722718 ... before I put you in one.
3732562 3734312 Is there no other?
3735064 3736982 Be hard for any man to risk his life ...
3737150 3740110 ... especially if he doesn't<br />understand the reason.
3740570 3744072 Captain Niobe of the Logos<br />will answer the councillor's call.
3744240 3746491 - What?<br />- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
3746701 3751788 Commander Lock, you have your orders.<br />This Council is hereby adjourned.
3756502 3759087 - Niobe, what are you doing?<br />- What I can.
3759255 3760297 Why?
3761591 3764843 Because some things<br />never change, Jason ...
3765011 3767345 ... and some things do.
3783780 3785197 What can you see, Neo?
3785364 3787699 It's strange.<br />The code is somehow different.
3787867 3789451 - Encrypted?<br />- Maybe.
3789619 3791578 Is that good for us or bad for us?
3792288 3795415 Well, it looks like every floor<br />is wired with explosives.
3796042 3797584 Bad for us.
3798002 3799503 Here we go.
3807512 3810430 Yes. We are here to speak<br />with the Merovingian.
3810890 3814726 Well, of course.<br />He has been expecting you.
3814894 3815936 Follow me.
3836624 3840293 A-ha. Here he is at last.
3840503 3843797 Neo, the One himself.
3843965 3845382 Right?
3845550 3847884 And the legendary Morpheus.
3848719 3853598 And Trinity, of course.<br />I have heard so much.
3853766 3857227 You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.<br />This is my wife, Persephone.
3858145 3861439 Something to eat? Drink?
3861732 3864776 Of course, such things are contrivances,<br />like so much here.
3864944 3867445 For the sake of appearances.
3867613 3871074 - No, thank you.<br />- Yes, of course. Who has time?
3871242 3876329 Who has time? But then, if we do not ever<br />take time, how can we ever have time?
3880042 3883420 Château Haut-Briond, 1959.<br />Magnificent wine.
3883588 3886506 I love French wine<br />like I love the French language.
3886674 3890844 I have sampled every language.<br />French is my favorite. Fantastic language ...
3891012 3893138 ... especially to curse with.
3897143 3901688 You see? It's like wiping your ass<br />with silk. I love it.
3903316 3905066 You know why we are here.
3906819 3911698 I am a trafficker of information.<br />I know everything I can.
3912116 3917954 The question is,<br />do you know why you are here?
3918247 3920707 We are looking for the Keymaker.
3921375 3925879 Oh, yes, it is true.<br />The Keymaker, of course.
3926047 3929007 But this is not a reason,<br />this is not a why.
3929175 3932928 The Keymaker himself, his very nature,<br />is a means, it is not an end.
3933095 3938850 And so to look for him is to be<br />looking for a means to do ...
3939018 3942187 ... what?<br />- You know the answer to that question.
3942355 3944481 But do you?
3944690 3947025 You think you do, but you do not.
3947193 3950403 You are here<br />because you were sent here.
3950571 3953698 You were told to come here,<br />and then you obeyed.
3954867 3957202 It is, of course, the way of all things.
3957370 3960038 You see, there is only one constant ...
3960206 3964376 ... one universal. It is the only real truth.
3964543 3966211 Causality.
3966379 3968672 Action, reaction.
3968839 3973051 - Cause and effect.<br />- Everything begins with choice.
3973219 3974970 No. Wrong.
3975137 3979724 Choice is an illusion created<br />between those with power ...
3979892 3981977 ... and those without.
3983521 3986690 Look there at that woman.
3987400 3991319 My God, just look at her ...
3991570 3994239 ... affecting everyone around her.
3994407 3999160 So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.<br />But wait.
3999412 4003164 Watch. You see, I have sent her<br />a dessert ...
4003374 4007585 ... a very special dessert.
4011924 4014384 I wrote it myself.
4014552 4017762 It starts so simply ...
4017930 4022517 ... each line of the program creating<br />a new effect, just like ...
4023561 4025186 ... poetry.
4025354 4026771 First ...
4027273 4032694 ... a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
4033279 4035905 You can see it, Neo, yes?
4036532 4039117 She does not understand why.
4039368 4041786 Is it the wine? No.
4041954 4044330 What is it then? What is the reason?
4044957 4047292 And soon it does not matter.
4047460 4050462 Soon the why and the reason are gone ...
4051422 4056968 ... and all that matters is the feeling itself.
4057428 4060513 And this is the nature of the universe.
4060681 4063224 We struggle against it,<br />we fight to deny it ...
4063392 4065977 ... but it is, of course, pretense.<br />It is a lie.
4066145 4070148 Beneath our poised appearance ...
4070316 4075612 ... the truth is, we are completely ...
4078491 4081367 ... out of control.
4086707 4091586 Causality. There is no escape from it.<br />We are forever slaves to it.
4092004 4097467 Our only hope, our only peace,<br />is to understand it, to understand the why.
4097635 4101054 "Why" is what separates us from them ...
4101222 4103515 ... you from me.
4103682 4107435 "Why" is the only real source of power.<br />Without it, you are powerless.
4107603 4110897 And this is how you come to me,<br />without why, without power.
4111065 4113858 Another link in the chain.
4114068 4115360 But fear not.
4115528 4119405 Since I have seen how good you are<br />at following orders ...
4119573 4122200 ... I will tell you what to do next.
4122701 4127539 Run back and give the fortune-teller<br />this message:
4127748 4132001 Her time is almost up.
4133045 4136589 Now I have some real business to do,<br />so I will say adieu and goodbye.
4136757 4139259 - This isn't over.<br />- Oh, yes, it is.
4139426 4145807 The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason<br />why I should give him up.
4145975 4150019 - No reason at all.<br />- Where are you going?
4150187 4154899 Please, ma chérie, I have told you.<br />We are all victims of causality.
4155067 4158403 I drank too much wine,<br />I must take a piss.
4158904 4162031 Cause and effect. Au Revoir.
4167079 4170165 Touch me and that hand<br />will never touch anything again.
4179049 4180550 Well, that didn't go so well.
4180718 4183094 Are you certain the Oracle<br />didn't say anything else?
4183262 4185388 - Yes.<br />- Maybe we did something wrong.
4186056 4187390 Or didn't do something.
4187558 4190810 No, what happened couldn't have<br />happened any other way.
4190978 4193730 - How do you know?<br />- We are still alive.
4197026 4200278 If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
4207286 4209370 Get out.
4211290 4217629 I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.<br />On and on. Pompous prick.
4218214 4223718 A long time ago, when we first came here,<br />it was so different.
4225471 4228181 He was so different.
4229975 4232602 He was like you.
4235314 4239108 I'll give you what you want,<br />but you have to give me something.
4239860 4242153 - What?<br />- A kiss.
4242529 4243655 Excuse me?
4245157 4249077 I want you to kiss me<br />as if you were kissing her.
4250996 4254582 - Why?<br />- You love her. She loves you.
4254833 4256793 It's all over you both.
4257461 4262006 A long time ago,<br />I knew what that felt like.
4263342 4269097 I want to remember it.<br />I want to sample it. That's all.
4269348 4271182 Just a sample.
4271350 4274352 - Why don't you sample this instead?<br />- Trinity.
4276563 4281526 Such emotion over something so small.<br />It's just a kiss.
4281694 4283861 Why should we trust you?
4284029 4288032 If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,<br />she can kill me.
4295124 4297250 All right.
4297543 4301379 But you have to make me believe<br />I am her.
4302589 4304632 All right.
4310973 4312807 Terrible. Forget it.
4315769 4317228 Wait.
4318147 4319689 Okay.
4356769 4358853 Yes.
4359438 4361939 That's it.
4376705 4382126 I envy you. But such a thing<br />is not meant to last.
4385130 4386506 Come with me.
4417579 4419330 Not again.
4422751 4425378 It's all right, boys. They're with me.
4426046 4428423 These fellas work for my husband.
4428590 4432427 They do his dirty work.<br />They're very good, very loyal.
4432594 4434137 Aren't you, boys?
4434304 4435346 Yes, mistress.
4435514 4438224 They come from a much older version<br />of the Matrix.
4438392 4442562 But like so many back then, they caused<br />more problems than they solved.
4443313 4448317 My husband saved them because<br />they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
4448485 4452530 How many people keep silver bullets<br />in their gun?
4457244 4460455 You can either run and tell my husband<br />what I have done ...
4460622 4463207 ... or you can stay there and die.
4464126 4466085 He's in the ladies' room!
4472176 4474093 Hurry.
4499661 4502830 - My name is Neo.<br />- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
4502998 4504916 I've been waiting for you.
4510839 4515426 Oh! My God! My God, Persephone,<br />how could you do this? You betray me.
4519765 4522600 - Cause and effect, my love.<br />- Cause?
4522768 4525770 There is no cause for this. What cause?
4525938 4530233 What cause? How about the lipstick<br />you're still wearing?
4530400 4533110 Lipstick? Lipstick.
4533278 4537114 What craziness are you talking about,<br />woman? There is no lipstick!
4538825 4541494 She wasn't kissing your face, my love.
4542621 4547083 Aye-yi-yi-yi.<br />Woman, this is nothing.
4547251 4552797 - It is a game. It is only a game.<br />- So is this.
4552965 4554966 Have fun.
4561473 4565059 All right.
4565310 4568104 Let us find out where this goes.
4568272 4571148 You two, get the Keymaker.
4577656 4579657 That's a nice trick.
4579825 4581117 I cannot go back.
4581660 4583661 I'll handle them.
4584162 4590293 Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,<br />your predecessors had much more respect.
4603682 4605725 Okay, you have some skill.
4607936 4609895 Kill him.
4670082 4672124 You see? He's just a man.
4806927 4809678 Goddamn it, woman,<br />you will be the end of me.
4811807 4815810 Mark my words, boy,<br />and mark them well.
4815977 4821190 I have survived your predecessors,<br />and I will survive you.
4841253 4844630 - Where are you going?<br />- Another way. Always another way.
4848760 4850636 Close it, quick!
4855433 4857977 Could we move along?
4861523 4863107 Run!
4879040 4881375 Step away from the door.
4886464 4887756 We owe you for that.
4890010 4891176 Just like new.
4891469 4892928 Drop your weapon.
4898310 4900144 - Stay with him.<br />- What about Neo?
4900312 4901854 He can handle himself.
4904941 4906025 Get in back.
4943688 4944855 Shit.
4945357 4946857 - Operator.<br />- Link, where am I?
4947400 4950611 You won't believe this,<br />but you're way up in the mountains.
4950904 4953197 - Really?<br />- It'll take me a while to get an exit.
4953698 4954740 - Shit!<br />- What?
4954950 4957618 The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.<br />They don't have a way out.
4957786 4961163 - Where are they?<br />- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.
4977931 4979515 - Operator.<br />- Get us out of here.
4979683 4982434 - Won't be easy.<br />- I know. We're inside the core network.
4982602 4985229 The only exit I got<br />near you is the Winslow overpass.
4985397 4987481 - Off the freeway.<br />- Yes, sir.
4987649 4991402 - Fine, we'll make it.<br />- I should -- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!
4996408 4997992 - Incoming fire.<br />- Down!
5006251 5007418 Hold on!
5024436 5026937 Oh, no. This is getting real ugly<br />real fast.
5027105 5028814 Are you watching this, Link?
5028982 5032609 Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.<br />Eight units headed your way.
5033653 5035612 Any suggestions?
5037490 5039491 - Turn right.<br />- Right, now.
5046958 5049793 Straight here.<br />You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
5049961 5052671 - Got it.<br />- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
5052839 5056550 - In 14 years of operating, I've never seen --<br />- Link, what did I tell you?
5056843 5059136 Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
5059304 5061805 - I'll be ready for you.<br />- Good man.
5061973 5064141 You always told me<br />to stay off the freeway.
5064309 5066935 - Yes, that's true.<br />- You said it was suicide.
5067145 5069063 Then let us hope ...
5069230 5070606 ... that I was wrong.
5082494 5083577 - Operator.<br />- Link, it's Niobe.
5083745 5085370 We've been sent to bring you in.
5085538 5088624 - I need to talk to Morpheus.<br />- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
5088792 5090793 - Where is he?<br />- Just follow the sirens.
5098343 5100260 Repeat, they're approaching the --
5103431 5107643 - We have them now.<br />- The exile is the primary target.
5170790 5172249 Shots fired.
5174878 5176753 Move!
5286739 5289950 - We are getting aggravated.<br />- Yes, we are.
5335997 5337998 Trinity.
5338416 5339541 Get him out of here.
5343171 5345255 Come on!
5362273 5363774 Crush him.
5394263 5395305 Morpheus.
5395473 5396973 He's okay. Keep moving.
5397975 5399768 Let's go.
5405525 5407692 I need a download<br />to hot-wire a motorcycle.
5407860 5410195 No problem.<br />One crash course on motorcycle --
5410363 5411780 Wait.
5413157 5414616 Cancel that.
5414784 5416993 You are handy.
5417161 5419079 Jump on.
5566352 5567394 She means nothing.
5567562 5570689 - Find the exile.<br />- We have them.
5571023 5573149 One-Adam-12, please respond.
5579615 5581324 Get down.
5712331 5713957 Gotcha.
5714709 5715792 She's good.
5720172 5722465 You are no longer necessary.
5729140 5732851 We do only what we're meant to do.
5734478 5738064 Then you are meant for one more thing:<br />deletion.
5739024 5740900 Go kick his ass.
5790951 5793703 Neo, if you're out there,<br />I could use some help.
5794455 5795914 What is that?
5825778 5828655 Yes! Yes!
5835246 5840375 We have confirmation from the Icarus. First<br />two ships are in position for counterattack.
5840626 5841668 Good.
5842670 5843711 Any change?
5843879 5846631 They hit some iron ore here.<br />Slowed them down a little.
5846799 5849926 - How much?<br />- An hour, maybe.
5850094 5852637 That would give them<br />a little over nine hours.
5853472 5855098 Yes, sir.
5887715 5889966 There is a building.
5890134 5895805 Inside this building, there is a level<br />where no elevator can go ...
5895973 5897891 ... and no stair can reach.
5898559 5904647 This level is filled with doors.<br />These doors lead to many places.
5904815 5907150 Hidden places.
5907484 5911112 But one door is special.
5911280 5913489 One door leads to the source.
5921832 5926252 This building is protected<br />by a very secure system.
5926420 5930924 - Every alarm triggers the bomb.<br />- Bomb? Did he say bomb?
5931175 5933843 But like all systems,<br />it has a weakness.
5934011 5937013 The system is based on the rules<br />of a building.
5937181 5940558 - One system built on another.<br />- Electricity.
5941101 5945855 - If one fails, so must the other.<br />- No electricity, no alarms.
5946023 5948858 You'd have to take out a city block<br />to kill the power.
5949026 5952737 - Not one, 27.<br />- Twenty-seven blocks?
5953572 5956032 There is a power station.
5956200 5958451 It must be destroyed.
5958619 5962956 - There must be some kind of fail-safe.<br />- Yes, there is an emergency system.
5964583 5968378 The core network of the grid<br />must be accessed.
5968545 5971381 The emergency system<br />must be deactivated.
5971548 5972966 What do you need us for?
5973133 5975301 Neo could take them out<br />easier than we could.
5975469 5977220 - There's no time.<br />- Why?
5977388 5980515 Once the door is unprotected,<br />the connection will be severed.
5980683 5982976 But another connection<br />must first be made.
5983811 5987647 - How long will that take?<br />- Exactly 314 seconds.
5987815 5989399 Just over five minutes.
5989566 5991818 That is the length<br />and breadth of the window.
5991986 5994278 Only the One can open the door ...
5994488 5997407 ... and only during that window<br />can the door be opened.
5998659 6000243 How do you know all this?
6000411 6005581 I know because I must know.<br />It is my purpose.
6005749 6011254 It's the reason I'm here,<br />the same reason we're all here.
6022016 6024809 Neo, I know something's wrong.
6025477 6027520 You don't have to tell me.
6027688 6031441 I just want you to know that I'm here.
6034987 6036446 All must be done as one.
6041201 6042869 Can't hurt.
6046415 6048499 If one fails ...
6049293 6051002 ... all fail.
6051503 6055173 At midnight, there is a shift change<br />in the security of both buildings.
6056550 6059802 At midnight, we will strike.
6060429 6061512 Hey!
6061680 6065641 - You count sheep at home.<br />- Why? I get paid to count them here.
6075819 6078029 Okay, they're inside.
6078197 6080698 - How much time?<br />- Twelve minutes.
6083410 6084494 Oh, shit.
6087873 6093336 All of our lives, we have fought this war.<br />Tonight, I believe we can end it.
6094838 6097006 Tonight is not an accident.
6098342 6100343 There are no accidents.
6101720 6106766 We have not come here by chance.<br />I do not believe in chance.
6106934 6112522 When I see three objectives,<br />three captains, three ships ...
6112689 6116192 ... I do not see coincidence.<br />I see providence.
6116527 6118861 I see purpose.
6121573 6127912 I believe it is our fate to be here.<br />It is our destiny.
6128080 6133084 I believe this night holds<br />for each and every one of us ...
6133252 6136587 ... the very meaning of our lives.
6136755 6140925 I want to ask you to do something,<br />but I don't know how.
6141510 6143427 I promise you, if I can, I will.
6144763 6148099 What if I asked you to stay out of this ...
6149059 6151060 ... no matter what ...
6151228 6153563 ... to stay out of the Matrix?
6154648 6156440 Why?
6164658 6165741 Please.
6167828 6169162 All right.
6172499 6175001 What is it, Niobe?
6175169 6179297 I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't<br />help thinking, what if you're wrong?
6179464 6182758 What if all this, the prophecy,<br />everything, is bullshit?
6182926 6186929 Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
6187347 6189974 But how would that be different<br />from any other day?
6199443 6205948 This is a war, and we are soldiers.
6206200 6209118 Death can come for us at any time ...
6209661 6211454 ... in any place.
6211622 6213539 Incoming. Incoming!
6215500 6217126 Incoming!
6223050 6225509 Now consider the alternative.
6225677 6230264 What if I am right?<br />What if the prophecy is true?
6230432 6234852 What if tomorrow the war could be over?
6235812 6238814 Isn't that worth fighting for?
6239942 6242568 Isn't that worth dying for?
6243487 6246113 - Time?<br />- Three minutes.
6246281 6247406 Almost there.
6267469 6268844 It is done.
6269012 6270304 Find the others.
6271431 6273683 I got Niobe there.<br />They're out of the station.
6273850 6276519 - What about Soren?<br />- There.
6276687 6278521 They're still inside, but ... .
6279398 6280439 They're not moving.
6304589 6306507 That's it, let's go.
6308635 6310469 Call Neo now.
6314433 6317268 - I lost them. They're inside the portal.<br />- What about the grid?
6321398 6324900 Everything is operational.<br />The emergency system is rerouting power.
6330574 6332742 Jesus.
6332909 6336954 Soon as they open that door,<br />it's all over.
6337122 6339081 The hell it is.
6339833 6341167 What are you --? Trinity!
6342461 6345421 I will not wait and do nothing.<br />I will not watch them die.
6345589 6347757 We're talking less than five minutes.
6347924 6350426 In five minutes,<br />I'll tear that building down.
6350594 6354138 - How much further?<br />- Here, just here.
6355432 6359435 I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
6360604 6363105 It's gotta be the ugliest hack<br />I have ever done.
6366318 6369445 That's as close as I can get you.<br />You better grow wings.
6388048 6389090 - Operator.<br />- I'm in.
6389257 6391425 Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
6392010 6396180 You look surprised to see me again,<br />Mr. Anderson.
6396348 6401727 Well, that's the difference between us.<br />I have been expecting you.
6401895 6404814 - What do you want, Smith?<br />- You haven't figured that out?
6404981 6410486 Still using all the muscles<br />except the one that matters.
6410654 6413322 I want exactly what you want.
6413490 6415574 I want everything.
6416034 6418536 Would that include a bullet<br />from this gun?
6418703 6420496 Go ahead, shoot.
6420664 6425960 The best thing about being me,<br />there's so many me's.
6437347 6440975 Christ! What the hell happened in here?
6441852 6443894 Hold it right there, little lady.
6453238 6455030 If you can't beat us ... .
6455198 6457032 Join us.
6459202 6460286 Morpheus!
6473884 6477011 Still no sight of them.<br />They only got two minutes left.
6490775 6491817 One minute.
6501036 6505164 Come on.
6505749 6507625 Please.
6517552 6519094 Kill them.
6526978 6528020 They're in.
6528188 6530147 I don't believe it.
6545705 6547831 It was meant to be.
6547999 6553379 Morpheus, that door will take you home.
6562138 6566475 You will know which door.<br />Hurry, Neo.
6571982 6575150 Trinity, I got some serious activity<br />headed your way.
6627454 6628829 Hello, Neo.
6629372 6633167 - Who are you?<br />- I am the Architect.
6633335 6636962 I created the Matrix.<br />I've been waiting for you.
6637213 6641383 You have many questions. Though the<br />process has altered your consciousness ...
6641551 6643552 ... you remain irrevocably human.
6643720 6647306 Ergo, some of my answers you will<br />understand and some you will not.
6647724 6651769 Concordantly, while your first question<br />may be the most pertinent ...
6651936 6655648 ... you may or may not realize<br />it is also the most irrelevant.
6656524 6658150 Why am I here?
6658318 6662237 Your life is the sum of a remainder<br />of an unbalanced equation ...
6662405 6664740 ... inherent to the programming<br />of the Matrix.
6664908 6668994 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,<br />which despite my sincerest efforts ...
6669162 6671997 ... I've been unable to eliminate<br />from what is otherwise ...
6672165 6676627 ... a harmony of mathematical precision.
6676961 6679296 While it remains a burden<br />assiduously avoided ...
6679464 6683926 ... it is not unexpected and thus<br />not beyond a measure of control ...
6684094 6688055 ... which has led you, inexorably ...
6689015 6690265 ... here.
6690433 6694520 - You haven't answered my question.<br />- Quite right.
6694688 6698482 Interesting.<br />That was quicker than the others.
6698650 6701276 Others? How many?<br />What others?
6701444 6703946 The Matrix is older than you know.
6704114 6708117 I count from the emergence of one integral<br />anomaly to the emergence of the next.
6708284 6710536 In which case, this is the sixth version.
6710704 6713163 Five before me?<br />He's lying. Bullshit.
6713331 6716875 There are only two possible explanations.<br />There were five before me.
6717043 6718335 Either no one told me ...
6719587 6723590 ... or no one knows.<br />- Precisely.
6723758 6727052 As you are undoubtedly gathering,<br />the anomaly is systemic ...
6727220 6730639 ... creating fluctuations in even<br />the most simplistic equations.
6730807 6734059 You can't control me!<br />I'm gonna smash you to bits!
6734227 6736019 I'm gonna fucking kill you!
6736187 6739356 You can't make me do anything.<br />You old, white prick!
6741651 6743152 Choice.
6743319 6745154 The problem is choice.
6767385 6771013 The first Matrix I designed<br />was naturally perfect, a work of art.
6771181 6773015 Flawless, sublime.
6773183 6776685 A triumph equaled only<br />by its monumental failure.
6777353 6779772 The inevitability of its doom<br />is apparent now ...
6779939 6783275 ... as a consequence of the imperfection<br />inherent in every human.
6783443 6786403 Thus, I redesigned it<br />based on your history ...
6786571 6790574 ... to more accurately reflect<br />the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
6791284 6795037 However, I was again frustrated<br />by failure.
6796498 6799124 I have come to understand<br />that the answer eluded me ...
6799292 6801335 ... because it required a lesser mind.
6801503 6807466 Or perhaps, a mind less bound<br />by the parameters of perfection.
6807884 6812304 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon<br />by another, an intuitive program ...
6812472 6817267 ... initially created to investigate<br />certain aspects of the human psyche.
6817435 6823398 If I am the father of the Matrix,<br />she would undoubtedly be its mother.
6824025 6826318 - The Oracle.<br />- Please.
6827028 6831031 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br />solution whereby 99 percent of subjects ...
6831199 6834076 ... accepted the program, as long as they<br />were given a choice ...
6834244 6838372 ... even if they were only aware<br />of the choice at a near unconscious level.
6838540 6841959 While this answer functioned,<br />it was fundamentally flawed ...
6842126 6846129 ... thus creating the otherwise<br />contradictory systemic anomaly ...
6846297 6849007 ... that, if left unchecked,<br />might threaten the system.
6849384 6853512 Ergo, those that refused the program,<br />while a minority, if unchecked ...
6853680 6857766 ... would constitute<br />an escalating probability of disaster.
6857934 6859726 This is about Zion.
6860186 6863856 You are here because Zion<br />is about to be destroyed.
6864023 6868443 Its every living inhabitant terminated,<br />its entire existence eradicated.
6868736 6869778 Bullshit.
6869946 6873115 Denial is the most predictable<br />of all human responses.
6873324 6879788 But rest assured, this will be<br />the sixth time we have destroyed it ...
6879956 6883959 ... and we have become<br />exceedingly efficient at it.
6896681 6897973 The function of the One ...
6898141 6902811 ... is now to return to the source, allowing<br />a dissemination of the code you carry ...
6902979 6904688 ... reinserting the prime program.
6905273 6909276 After which you will be required to select<br />from the Matrix 23 individuals ...
6909444 6912696 ... sixteen female, seven male,<br />to rebuild Zion.
6912864 6917409 Failure to comply with this process<br />will result in a cataclysmic system crash ...
6917577 6919912 ... killing everyone connected<br />to the Matrix ...
6920079 6922664 ... which, coupled with the<br />extermination of Zion ...
6922832 6927044 ... will result in the extinction<br />of the entire human race.
6927378 6931465 You won't let it happen. You can't.<br />You need human beings to survive.
6932258 6935886 There are levels of survival<br />we are prepared to accept.
6936054 6938847 The relevant issue is<br />whether or not you are ready ...
6939015 6942601 ... to accept the responsibility for the death<br />of every human being in this world.
6949067 6951610 It is interesting reading your reactions.
6952654 6956490 Your five predecessors were, by design,<br />based on a similar predication ...
6956658 6961119 ... a contingent affirmation that was meant<br />to create a profound attachment ...
6961287 6964873 ... to the rest of your species,<br />facilitating the function of the One.
6965041 6967376 While the others experience this<br />in a general way ...
6967543 6970504 ... your experience is far more specific ...
6970838 6973715 ... vis-à-vis love.
6974717 6976343 Trinity!
6978638 6982975 Apropos, she entered the Matrix<br />to save your life at the cost of her own.
6983351 6984393 No.
6985103 6989231 Which brings us at last to the moment<br />of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw ...
6989399 6992484 ... is ultimately expressed<br />and the anomaly revealed ...
6992652 6996655 ... as both beginning and end.
6996823 6998490 There are two doors.
6998658 7001868 The door to your right leads to the source<br />and the salvation of Zion.
7002453 7008750 The door to your left leads back to the<br />Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
7008918 7013296 As you adequately put,<br />the problem is choice.
7013464 7016967 But we already know what<br />you are going to do, don't we?
7017135 7021221 Already I can see the chain reaction,<br />the chemical precursors that signal ...
7021389 7026643 ... the onset of an emotion designed<br />specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
7026811 7031440 An emotion that is already blinding you<br />from the simple and obvious truth:
7031607 7038113 She is going to die and there is nothing<br />you can do to stop it.
7043119 7047247 Hope. It is the quintessential<br />human delusion, simultaneously ...
7047415 7051126 ... the source of your greatest strength<br />and your greatest weakness.
7051294 7055630 If I were you, I would hope<br />that we don't meet again.
7055798 7057215 We won't.
7064640 7066850 We got a serious situation, sir.
7067310 7068393 Oh, no.
7128037 7131581 - What was that?<br />- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.
7182216 7184009 Holy shit, he caught her.
7197940 7199774 Neo, I had to.
7199942 7201693 I know.
7206741 7209284 The bullet is still inside.
7220046 7221963 Trinity ...
7223174 7224883 ... don't you quit on me now.
7234060 7236645 I'm sorry.
7243152 7245445 Trinity.
7255414 7257374 Trinity ...
7257541 7259334 ... I know you can hear me.
7260127 7262671 I'm not letting go.
7262838 7264464 I can't.
7265675 7267884 I love you too damn much.
7296580 7297872 I can't take this.
7301627 7304713 I guess this makes us even.
7317393 7319352 I don't understand it.
7319520 7322522 Everything was done<br />as it was supposed to be done.
7322690 7325734 Once the One reaches the source,<br />the war should be over.
7325901 7328737 - In 24 hours, it will be.<br />- What?
7328904 7333241 If we don't do something in 24 hours,<br />Zion will be destroyed.
7333659 7335285 - What?<br />- How do you know that?
7335745 7337787 - I was told it would happen.<br />- By whom?
7338789 7341624 It doesn't matter. I believed him.
7341792 7345628 - That's impossible. The prophecy tells us --<br />- It was a lie, Morpheus.
7347381 7349924 The prophecy was a lie.
7351135 7354137 The One was never meant<br />to end anything.
7354305 7357349 It was all another system of control.
7357516 7360602 I don't believe that.
7360936 7363271 But you said it yourself.
7363439 7367442 How can the prophecy be true<br />if the war isn't over?
7373616 7376076 I'm sorry.
7376243 7379621 I know it isn't easy to hear, but ...
7379789 7382957 ... I swear to you it's the truth.
7386170 7388880 - What are we gonna do?<br />- I don't know.
7391092 7392300 Oh, no!
7401644 7404979 - What are they doing?<br />- They're just out of EMP range.
7405481 7406731 It's a bomb.
7407900 7410110 We have to get out of here. Now.
7446814 7448690 I have dreamed a dream ...
7451735 7455113 ... but now that dream<br />has gone from me.
7466167 7468418 Here they come.
7468669 7470378 Let's go, Morpheus.
7471797 7474841 - We won't make it.<br />- We have to try.
7482558 7485560 - Come on!<br />- Something's different.
7485728 7487729 What?
7488397 7489898 I can feel them.
7512838 7514422 Neo!
7520596 7524182 - What happened?<br />- I don't know.
7529438 7531356 It's the Hammer.
7543035 7545745 He's in some kind of coma ...
7545913 7548164 ... but his vitals are stable.
7549375 7551292 What about you?
7551460 7553586 I'm fine.
7553754 7556130 You could use some rest.
7556298 7558132 No, I'm gonna stay with him.
7565224 7567850 Lock was right.<br />He guessed that the machines ...
7568018 7570895 ... would cut off the mainlines<br />in and out of Zion.
7571063 7573815 He thought a counterattack<br />might surprise them.
7574066 7577485 It sounded good.<br />I figured we had a shot ...
7577820 7580363 ... until someone screwed it up.
7580531 7583157 An EMP was triggered before<br />we got in position.
7583325 7585201 Five ships were instantly downed.
7585369 7587161 When the machines broke through ...
7587329 7590540 ... it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
7590708 7593543 Was it an accident?<br />Some sort of malfunction?
7593711 7596170 - No one knows.<br />- Someone does.
7596338 7598089 Who?
7598257 7601968 Once the machines were done with us,<br />they started digging again.
7602136 7604429 We made a quick pass<br />to look for survivors.
7604638 7605722 You found one?
7607474 7609183 Only one.
8202277 8205571 Everything that has a beginning ...
8205739 8207448 ... has an end.
8209868 8212745 I see the end coming.
8212913 8216707 I see the darkness spreading.<br />I see death.
8218835 8221837 Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
8222005 8224006 We missed you.
8224174 8226008 It ends tonight.
8233225 8236352 You are all that stands in his way.
8237938 8242483 If you cannot stop him tonight,<br />then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
