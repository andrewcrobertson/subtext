87824 89656 See you tomorrow.
108970 110005 Oh, my God!
132660 134151 I'm in.
247271 249058 We're almost there.
249232 253192 - Sir, are you sure about this?<br />- I told you, we're going to be all right.
253361 256271 I understand, sir. It's<br />just that I'm scoping
256283 258823 some serious sentinel<br />activity up here.
296987 299400 - Link.<br />- Yes, sir?
299572 302690 Given your situation, I can't say<br />I understand your reasons...
302867 305530 for volunteering to operate<br />onboard my ship.
305704 309698 However, if you wish to continue to<br />do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
310250 311707 What's that, sir?
312460 313746 To trust me.
313920 315877 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
317924 321088 - I mean, I do, sir.<br />- I hope so.
321261 324628 Repatch the main AC to the hard drives<br />and stand by to broadcast.
324805 325886 Yes, sir.
334732 336974 Still can't sleep?
338944 340310 You wanna talk?
342656 345023 They're just dreams.
347369 349736 If you're afraid of something...
349913 351745 I just wish...
352416 354658 I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
354835 356667 That's all.
357588 359170 I just wish I knew.
359340 363584 She's gonna call. Don't worry.
363761 364796 Here you are.
364969 368428 - Are we ready to go?<br />- We're already late.
368598 373218 These geotherms confirm<br />the last transmission of the <i>Osiris.</i>
373978 375640 The machines are digging.
377315 379602 They're boring from the surface<br />down to Zion.
379776 382359 - Mother...<br />- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
382528 384019 How fast are they moving?
384197 387565 Control estimates their descent<br />at 100 meters an hour.
387742 390200 - How deep are they?<br />- Almost 2000 meters.
390370 393909 - What about the scans from the <i>Osiris</i>?<br />- They can't be accurate.
394082 395994 - They may be.<br />- It's not possible.
396167 398625 That'd mean there are<br />a quarter-million sentinels.
398795 400286 - That's right.<br />- That can't be.
400463 402125 Why not?
402298 406042 A sentinel for every man,<br />woman and child in Zion.
407010 410970 That sounds exactly like<br />the thinking of a machine to me.
411139 413301 Morpheus, glad you could join us.
413809 414970 Niobe.
416353 419721 My apologies to all.<br />But as you are undoubtedly aware...
419898 423187 it's become difficult to locate<br />a secure broadcast position.
423360 426603 - Squiddies got our best spots.<br />- Lines are crawling with them.
426780 430569 And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours<br />there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
430742 431858 What are we gonna do?
432035 434322 We're gonna do what<br />Commander Lock ordered.
434663 437246 We'll evacuate broadcast level<br />and return to Zion.
437416 442536 And does the commander have a plan<br />for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
442712 445375 A strategy is still being formulated.
445549 447211 I'm sure it is.
462231 464223 What do you think<br />we should do, Morpheus?
464442 466559 - Proceed as ordered...<br />- What is it?
466735 467771 I don't know.
467945 470733 However, I must<br />ask one of you for help.
470906 476618 Some of you believe as I believe, some<br />of you do not. Those of you that do...
476787 479325 know we are nearing<br />the end of our struggle.
479498 483742 The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.<br />But before it can be...
483919 487253 the Oracle must be consulted.
495180 497422 If we return and recharge now...
497599 501343 we can be back in 36 hours, well<br />before the machines reach this depth.
501561 503393 Do you understand what you're asking?
503563 506397 I am asking that one ship<br />remain here in our place...
506566 509274 in case the Oracle<br />should attempt to contact us.
509444 512562 Bullshit. You're asking one of us<br />to disobey a direct order.
512739 517279 That's right, I am. But we well know<br />that the reason most of us are here...
517452 520069 is because of our affinity<br />for disobedience.
520246 522158 What happens when you<br />get back to Zion...
522332 524745 and the commander<br />throws you in the stockade?
524918 526125 He won't.
527253 530462 Goddamn it, Morpheus,<br />you ain't never gonna change.
531174 533916 Shit, I'll do it just to see<br />what Deadbolt does to you.
534092 535628 You got 36 hours.
538430 540262 I'm looking for Neo.
540432 543800 - Never heard of him.<br />- I have something for him.
545020 547228 A gift.
547439 550307 You see, he set me free.
552611 554978 Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
555531 556567 Who was that?
556740 558572 How did you know someone was here?
558742 560199 He gave you this.
565958 567369 He said you set him free.
569336 571669 Is everything all right, sir?
572297 574664 The meeting is over.<br />Retreat to your exits.
574841 577048 - Agents are coming.<br />- Agents?
577510 578876 Go.
588688 589769 Hiya, fellas.
589939 591208 - It's him.<br />- The anomaly.
591232 592473 - Do we proceed?<br />- Yes.
592650 595142 - He is still...<br />- Only human.
601325 603567 Hm. Upgrades.
658506 661043 - That went as expected.<br />- Yes.
661216 663879 It's happening exactly as before.
664053 666716 Well, not exactly.
670434 672551 - What happened?<br />- I can't figure it out.
672728 674390 Agents just came out of nowhere.
674563 677556 Then the code got all weird.<br />Encryption I've never seen.
677733 680646 - Is Neo okay?<br />- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
680819 682230 Where is he now?
683697 685438 He's doing his Superman thing.
735415 736872 Where are you?
741546 745129 This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i><br />requesting access through Gate Three.
749177 753638 <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, this is Zion Control.<br />Maintain present velocity and stand by.
753807 755298 <i>Roger that, Control.</i>
755475 758968 This is Control requesting immediate<br />stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
759771 762980 We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i><br />on approach. Let's open her up.
768572 771485 <i>You are cleared through<br />Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>
771658 773365 Roger that, Control.
780500 783584 Door's open, bed's made.<br />Welcome home.
784337 786499 No place like it.
800686 804396 Roger that, Control. Zion Control,<br />stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
853905 856318 <i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.<br />Bay Seven.</i>
856491 857652 Understood.
867627 868913 Captain Mifune.
870004 871165 Captain Morpheus.
871339 874172 Are you here to escort me<br />to the stockade, captain?
874341 876781 - I'm just here to keep the peace.<br />- Commander Lock demands...
879012 882176 Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
883100 884932 - Link.<br />- Sir?
885102 887685 I want the ship ready to go<br />as soon as possible.
887855 889391 Understood, sir.
896572 898985 - What is it between them?<br />- Morpheus and Lock?
900117 902279 - Niobe.<br />- Captain Niobe?
902452 905661 She used to be with Morpheus.<br />Now she's with Lock.
906915 908497 What happened?
908709 912123 Morpheus went to the Oracle.<br />After that, everything changed.
912296 914958 Yeah, she can do that.
915131 916292 Neo!
917300 920168 - Oh, no.<br />- How does he always know?
920344 922301 Doesn't he have anything better to do?
922471 925179 You know what they say<br />about the life you save.
925349 927136 I didn't save his life.
929312 930678 Hiya, Neo.
931856 934473 - Trinity, Link.<br />- Hey.
934650 938314 - It's great to have you back.<br />- Thanks. It's good to be back.
938487 941230 - Can I carry that for you?<br />- No, I can carry my own bag.
941407 943069 - Trinity?<br />- I'm fine.
944035 946903 - You can carry these.<br />- Yeah, sure, Link.
951834 956329 Hey, you know, next year<br />I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
956505 959247 I've been thinking about it,<br />and I've made my decision.
959424 960881 Let me guess.
961384 963341 I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
964346 967885 Morpheus hasn't filled the other<br />positions, except for you, Link.
968058 969424 I'm sure he has reasons...
969601 972935 but the more I think about it,<br />the more I think it's meant to be.
973104 974640 You know, it's fate.
974814 976350 You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
976524 979062 I told you, you found me.<br />I didn't find you.
979235 981773 I know, but you got me out.<br />You saved me.
982906 984522 You saved yourself.
1000839 1004128 - Morpheus.<br />- Commander Lock.
1004385 1008880 I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to<br />offer you a chance to explain your actions.
1009056 1011924 I wasn't aware that my actions<br />required any explanation.
1012101 1014388 You were given an order<br />to return to Zion.
1014561 1017395 - I did.<br />- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
1017564 1020227 I would have stayed,<br />but I needed to recharge my ship.
1020401 1023109 So you admit to a direct contravention<br />of your duty.
1023278 1026692 We need a presence inside the Matrix<br />to await contact from the Oracle.
1026865 1028822 I don't want to hear that shit!
1028993 1031656 I don't care about oracles<br />or prophecies or messiahs!
1031829 1035243 Stopping that<br />army from destroying this city.
1035416 1038250 To do that I need soldiers<br />to obey my orders.
1038419 1043004 With all due respect, commander,<br />there is only one way to save our city.
1043172 1044583 How?
1044757 1047545 - Neo.<br />- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
1047719 1050336 Not everyone believes what you believe.
1050513 1052596 My beliefs do not require them to.
1060773 1064687 There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's<br />talking. A lot of people are scared.
1064861 1067604 No one remembers the last time<br />so many ships were docked.
1067780 1070739 - Something big is happening, isn't it?<br />- Hey.
1070908 1074072 We're not allowed to say anything,<br />so stop asking.
1079375 1082493 Goddamn, it's good to be home.
1095515 1098474 I'm recommending that you<br />be removed from duty.
1098643 1100976 That is, of course,<br />your prerogative, commander.
1101146 1105015 If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot<br />on a ship for the rest of your life.
1105192 1107935 Then I am grateful that<br />it is not up to you.
1114409 1116822 - Councillor Hamann.<br />- Commander.
1117496 1120204 - Captain.<br />- Councillor.
1120373 1123741 Council's asked me to speak tonight<br />at the temple gathering.
1123919 1128003 The presence of the fleet and the<br />persistence of rumors must be addressed.
1128172 1130664 The people must be told<br />what is happening.
1130841 1132548 Of course, councillor.
1133260 1138506 But might I advise a level of discretion<br />concerning specific details.
1138682 1141675 - We do not wish to start a panic.<br />- Quite right.
1141852 1144936 A panic is not what anyone wants.
1145106 1148440 What about you, captain?<br />What would you advise?
1150861 1155606 The truth. No one will panic,<br />because there is nothing to fear.
1155783 1157900 That army won't reach<br />the gates of Zion.
1158702 1162286 - What makes you so sure?<br />- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
1162456 1164322 Consider that in the past six months...
1164500 1166537 we have freed more minds<br />than in six years.
1166710 1169702 This attack is an act of desperation.
1169879 1173714 I believe very soon the prophecy<br />will be fulfilled and this war will end.
1175593 1177710 I hope you're right, captain.
1177887 1180595 I do not believe it to be<br />a matter of hope, councillor.
1180765 1183348 It is simply a matter of time.
1185520 1186977 My stop.
1187147 1188558 See you soon.
1188731 1190188 Hopefully not too soon.
1190358 1193522 Let's go, kid.<br />These two got things to do.
1202954 1204695 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1204873 1207286 I am if you're thinking<br />this elevator is too slow.
1207458 1210791 - How long do we charge the <i>Neb</i>?<br />- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
1210961 1215171 Some people go their entire lives<br />without hearing news that good.
1239615 1243950 Neo, please, I have a son,<br />Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis.</i>
1244119 1247612 - Please, watch over him.<br />- I'll try.
1247789 1249872 I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus.</i>
1250667 1251953 No, wait.
1252127 1254618 It's all right. They need you.
1254795 1257037 - I need you.<br />- I know.
1257590 1259877 There's time.
1264847 1266964 Where's my puss...?
1267141 1269474 - Hey!<br />- Uncle Link!
1269644 1271260 God!
1271437 1273394 Uncle Link!
1273564 1277148 Oh, my God! You're so huge!
1277318 1279480 - You should be picking me up!<br />- No!
1279654 1281190 - Yeah!<br />- Okay!
1281364 1283071 Okay? All right.
1283241 1286279 Now, we're gonna have<br />to work together here, okay?
1286452 1288660 One, two, three, lift!
1288829 1291993 Oh, my God!<br />What are you feeding these two?
1292166 1294874 Come on, kids. It's time to go.
1296670 1298002 - Hey, Cas.<br />- Hey.
1298546 1301084 - Good to have you home, Link.<br />- Good to be home.
1301258 1303090 You be careful with her.
1303260 1306048 Don't worry about me.<br />He's the one that's gonna get it.
1307889 1310256 Out the door! Both of you, march!
1310433 1312470 - Bye!<br />- Bye!
1318858 1320394 I'm gonna get what?
1321695 1325780 Every ship up there's been home two, even<br />three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
1325949 1329784 Come on, Zee.<br />I thought we were past this.
1329953 1333367 - We'll be when you operate another ship.<br />- I can't do that.
1333540 1335031 - Why?<br />- You know why.
1335208 1338371 If Dozer knew how I felt,<br />he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
1339086 1341624 Maybe. But it's too late now.
1341797 1344414 I made a promise,<br />and some promises can't be unmade.
1344591 1347299 - It's not fair.<br />- Nobody said it was gonna be.
1347469 1350428 You think Cas thinks it's fair<br />that I'm here and Dozer's not?
1356353 1359562 I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
1360649 1362857 I'm afraid of it.
1364445 1367062 I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
1367740 1369572 It won't.
1369742 1371574 How can you say that to me?
1371744 1373701 Because of Morpheus.
1373871 1378491 Because of what he's told me. He said<br />that this is it, that it will be over soon.
1378667 1382876 - Link, Morpheus is crazy.<br />- No doubt.
1383379 1386588 But Tank and Dozer believed him.<br />And I'll tell you what...
1386758 1392095 after being on that ship and seeing Neo<br />do the things he can do, I gotta say...
1392263 1394300 I'm starting to believe him too.
1399437 1401850 Be careful, Link.
1407195 1409562 Please be careful.
1418664 1422078 - They started yet?<br />- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
1422251 1425334 Tonight, let us honor<br />these men and women.
1425504 1428121 These are our soldiers, our warriors.
1428298 1432542 These are our husbands and wives,<br />our brothers and sisters...
1432719 1434381 our children.
1434971 1438089 Let us remember those<br />that have been lost...
1438266 1441475 and let us give thanks<br />for those that have been found...
1441645 1444934 and who stand here beside us.
1445148 1448812 Now I would like someone else<br />to close this prayer...
1448985 1452194 someone who hasn't spoken here<br />in a long time...
1452364 1457735 but who I believe has something to say<br />that we all need to hear.
1458745 1460327 I give you Morpheus.
1479849 1484014 Zion! Hear me!
1485020 1488138 It is true what many of you have heard.
1488315 1492309 The machines have gathered<br />an army, and as I speak...
1492486 1496400 that army is drawing nearer to our home.
1497867 1502532 Believe me when I say we have<br />a difficult time ahead of us.
1503205 1509371 But if we are to be prepared for it,<br />we must first shed our fear of it.
1509878 1514794 I stand here before you now<br />truthfully unafraid.
1515383 1517124 Why?
1517552 1520386 Because I believe something you do not?
1520555 1522387 No!
1522682 1527643 I stand here without fear<br />because I remember.
1527812 1531726 I remember that I am here not because<br />of the path that lies before me...
1531900 1535234 but because of the path<br />that lies behind me.
1535403 1540068 I remember that for 100 years<br />we have fought these machines.
1540241 1544986 I remember that for 100 years<br />they have sent their armies to destroy us.
1545163 1551250 And after a century of war,<br />I remember that which matters most:
1552127 1555120 We are still here!
1561845 1563928 Tonight...
1564097 1567465 let us send a message to that army.
1567643 1570681 Tonight, let us shake this cave.
1570854 1574723 Tonight, let us tremble these halls...
1574900 1578018 of earth, steel and stone.
1578195 1583441 Let us be heard from red core<br />to black sky.
1583617 1588157 Tonight, let us make them remember:
1588330 1593290 This is Zion and we are not afraid!
1616649 1618641 I remember.
1619485 1621898 I remember you used to dance.
1623531 1626820 I remember you were pretty good.
1627577 1630820 There are some things in this world,<br />Captain Niobe...
1631622 1634409 that will never change.
1635709 1637621 Niobe!
1642340 1644081 Some things do change.
1663361 1665193 Excuse me.
1677041 1680534 - I missed you.<br />- I can tell.
1681003 1684713 I was thinking, everyone is here.
1685257 1687544 Follow me.
1888539 1892123 Neo, what is it?
1892417 1894659 What's wrong?
1896255 1898588 It's okay, you can tell me.
1898966 1901458 Trinity...
1901635 1904423 Don't be afraid.
1904596 1906929 I can't lose you.
1907099 1908965 You're not gonna lose me.
1913105 1915973 You feel this?
1916149 1917936 I'm never letting go.
1955146 1957809 Good night, Zion.
1957982 1960645 Sweet dreams.
1970828 1972490 - You all right?<br />- I'll make it.
1972663 1975279 Did you see that agent?<br />I've never seen anything like that.
1975457 1977540 It doesn't matter.<br />All that matters is this.
1977709 1979996 You first.
1990889 1993757 - Oh, God.<br />- "Smith" will suffice.
2005695 2008984 - Thank you.<br />- My pleasure.
2058955 2062244 - Care for some company?<br />- Councillor Hamann.
2063126 2065960 I don't want to intrude<br />if you'd prefer to be alone.
2066421 2069960 - No, I could probably use some company.<br />- Good.
2070425 2072792 So could I.
2075930 2078422 It's nice tonight.
2078933 2081346 Very calm.
2081519 2084262 It feels like everyone is sleeping<br />very peacefully.
2084647 2087105 Not everyone.
2087400 2092111 I hate sleeping.<br />I never sleep more than a few hours.
2092280 2096320 I figure I slept the first 11 years<br />of my life, now I'm making up for it.
2096784 2101494 - What about you?<br />- I just haven't been able to sleep much.
2102956 2106120 - It's a good sign.<br />- Of what?
2106293 2109457 That you are in fact still human.
2113050 2116964 Have you ever been<br />to the engineering level?
2117137 2120175 I love to walk there at night.<br />It's quite amazing.
2120348 2122886 - Would you like to see it?<br />- Sure.
2133570 2138031 Almost no one comes down here.<br />Unless, of course, there's a problem.
2138200 2143285 That's how it is with people. Nobody cares<br />how it works as long as it works.
2143454 2145741 I like it down here.
2145915 2151707 I like to be reminded this city survives<br />because of these machines.
2151879 2156999 These machines are keeping us alive<br />while other machines are coming to kill us.
2157426 2162262 Interesting, isn't it?<br />The power to give life...
2162431 2165640 - and the power to end it.<br />- We have the same power.
2165810 2168518 Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
2168687 2172146 sometimes I think about those people<br />still plugged into the Matrix.
2172316 2175309 And when I look at these machines...
2175486 2180572 I can't help thinking that, in a way,<br />we are plugged into them.
2180866 2183734 But we control these machines,<br />they don't control us.
2184161 2187153 Of course not. How could they?
2187330 2189868 The idea is pure nonsense...
2190375 2193493 but it does make one wonder just...
2193670 2195252 what is control?
2195505 2198543 If we wanted, we could<br />shut these machines down.
2198925 2203386 Of course. That's it. You hit it.<br />That's control, isn't it?
2204013 2207381 If we wanted,<br />we could smash them to bits.
2207642 2211761 Although if we did, we'd have to consider<br />what would happen to our lights...
2211938 2214601 our heat, our air.
2215608 2219727 So we need machines and they need us.<br />Is that your point, councillor?
2219904 2222521 No. No point.
2223241 2227325 Old men like me don't bother<br />with making points. There's no point.
2228120 2231909 Is that why there are no young men<br />on the Council?
2232082 2233744 Good point.
2234459 2238624 Why don't you tell me<br />what's on your mind, councillor.
2238797 2242040 There is so much in this world...
2242217 2245130 that I do not understand.
2246930 2251675 See that machine? It has something to do<br />with recycling our water supply.
2251852 2254845 I have absolutely no idea how it works.
2255022 2259107 But I do understand the reason<br />for it to work.
2260611 2265106 I have absolutely no idea how you<br />are able to do some of the things you do.
2266283 2269446 But I believe there's a reason for that<br />as well.
2270328 2275448 I only hope we understand that reason<br />before it's too late.
2281964 2283626 - Ballard.<br />- Is he here?
2286052 2288635 Neo, it's from the Oracle.
2291599 2293306 It's time to go.
2294268 2296726 Morpheus said this was how<br />it was gonna happen.
2296896 2301311 I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,<br />maybe it's not.
2301859 2305023 All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
2306614 2308480 Right now, that operator's me.
2309116 2311199 I know.
2316164 2317826 - Zee...<br />- I want you to wear it.
2317999 2321083 - You know I don't believe in this stuff.<br />- But I do.
2321378 2324337 It's always brought me luck.
2324506 2328625 - Maybe it'll bring me you.<br />- I'm coming back.
2328802 2333342 I promise. No matter what it takes,<br />I'm coming home.
2334057 2337676 Just keep it with you. Please.
2337852 2339935 For me.
2342357 2344644 Okay.
2364128 2366290 - Neo!<br />- How the hell...?
2366714 2368876 Bane.
2369049 2370381 Is something wrong?
2370551 2372258 No, I'm fine.
2372428 2375216 I just wanted to catch you to say...
2375389 2377221 good luck.
2378892 2380599 Thanks.
2380769 2383182 We'll see you.
2384773 2387857 Neo! Just in time.
2388027 2390360 - You're gonna see the Oracle?<br />- There's no time.
2390529 2392145 I had to give something to Neo.
2392865 2395573 A gift from one of the orphans.
2395743 2399156 He made me swear to get it to you<br />before you left.
2400038 2402496 He said you'd understand.
2405168 2407285 Thanks.
2414385 2417298 I was just told you cleared<br />the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> for takeoff.
2417472 2419429 That is correct.
2419599 2421556 Am I still in charge<br />of our defense system?
2421726 2423012 Of course.
2423728 2427768 I believe I need every ship we have<br />if we're going to survive this attack.
2428358 2430520 I understand that, commander.
2430693 2433276 Then why did you allow<br />the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?
2433446 2438316 Because I believe our survival depends<br />on more than how many ships we have.
2440827 2443114 Be careful.
2472150 2474358 Hello.
2484662 2488201 - You seek the Oracle.<br />- Who are you?
2491252 2495747 I am Seraph. I can take you to her,<br />but first I must apologize.
2496006 2497713 Apologize for what?
2498384 2500171 For this.
2557484 2559726 Good.
2562238 2565402 The Oracle has many enemies.<br />I had to be sure.
2565575 2567782 - Of what?<br />- That you are the One.
2568243 2571987 - You could have just asked.<br />- No. You do not truly know someone...
2572164 2574406 until you fight them.
2574958 2578417 Come. She's waiting.
2593477 2595343 Where the hell did they go?
2595729 2598437 These are back doors, aren't they?
2598607 2601520 Programmer access.
2602611 2606355 - How do they work?<br />- A code is hidden in tumblers.
2606532 2611526 One position opens a lock and another<br />position opens one of these doors.
2613287 2616121 Are you a programmer?
2616290 2618623 Then what are you?
2620795 2624288 I protect that which matters most.
2643818 2647186 Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
2647613 2650400 Come around here<br />and let me have a look at you.
2653618 2655985 My goodness, look at you.
2656329 2659163 You turned out all right, didn't you?
2659332 2661540 - How do you feel?<br />- I...
2661710 2665294 I know you're not sleeping.<br />We'll get to that.
2665463 2668171 Why don't you come<br />and have a sit this time.
2668883 2673002 - Maybe I'll stand.<br />- Well, suit yourself.
2684149 2686687 - I felt like sitting.<br />- I know.
2687861 2689773 So...
2691865 2694277 let's get the obvious stuff<br />out of the way.
2694575 2699036 - You're not human, are you?<br />- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
2699204 2705041 If I had to guess, I'd say you're<br />a program from the machine world.
2705419 2709629 - So is he.<br />- So far, so good.
2709798 2712962 But if that's true, that could mean<br />you're part of this system...
2713135 2715718 another kind of control.
2715888 2720383 - Keep going.<br />- I suppose the most obvious question is...
2720559 2724473 - how can I trust you?<br />- Bingo.
2725522 2728765 It is a pickle, no doubt about it.<br />Bad news is...
2728942 2732606 there's no way you can really know<br />if I'm here to help you or not.
2732780 2736318 So it's really up to you. Just have<br />to make up your own damn mind...
2736491 2741282 to either accept what<br />I'm going to tell you or reject it.
2742580 2744742 Candy?
2747460 2749498 Do you already<br />know if I'll take it?
2749510 2751875 Wouldn't be much<br />of an oracle if I didn't.
2752048 2755257 But if you already know,<br />how can I make a choice?
2755426 2759466 Because you didn't come here to make<br />the choice. You've already made it.
2759639 2764259 You're here to try to understand<br />why you made it.
2769816 2772775 I thought you'd have figured that out<br />by now.
2774529 2777112 - Why are you here?<br />- Same reason.
2777365 2780107 I love candy.
2780283 2783117 But why help us?
2783286 2786779 We're all here to do<br />what we're all here to do.
2787332 2790416 I'm interested in one thing, Neo:<br />the future.
2790585 2794795 And believe me, I know, the only way<br />to get there is together.
2795632 2800548 - Are there other programs like you?<br />- Well, not like me, but...
2800721 2803384 Look. See those birds?
2803640 2807008 At some point, a program was written<br />to govern them.
2807185 2813022 A program was written to watch over the<br />trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
2813275 2816143 There are programs running<br />all over the place.
2816319 2820779 The ones doing their job, doing what<br />they were meant to do, are invisible.
2820948 2824783 You'd never even know they were here.<br />But the other ones...
2824952 2829037 Well, you hear about them all the time.
2829623 2832491 - I've never heard of them.<br />- Of course you have.
2832668 2837584 Every time you've heard someone<br />say they saw a ghost or an angel...
2837757 2842343 every story you've ever heard about<br />vampires, werewolves or aliens...
2842511 2844844 is the system assimilating<br />some program...
2845014 2849679 that's doing something<br />they're not supposed to be doing.
2849852 2852845 Programs hacking programs.
2853022 2855890 - Why?<br />- They have their reasons...
2856066 2860026 but usually a program chooses exile<br />when it faces deletion.
2860446 2864359 - And why would a program be deleted?<br />- Maybe it breaks down.
2864532 2869072 Maybe a better program is created<br />to replace it. Happens all the time.
2869245 2874206 And when it does, a program<br />can either choose to hide here...
2874375 2877038 or return to the source.
2878713 2882002 - The machine mainframe.<br />- Yes.
2882175 2884667 Where you must go.
2884844 2889054 Where the path of the One ends.<br />You've seen it...
2890225 2893059 in your dreams, haven't you?
2893228 2896062 A door made of light?
2898316 2901855 What happens when you go through<br />the door?
2903988 2906980 I see Trinity...
2907157 2910321 and something happens...
2910494 2912406 something bad.
2912579 2916573 She starts to fall,<br />and then I wake up.
2917626 2921495 - Do you see her die?<br />- No.
2922297 2925335 You have the sight now, Neo.
2925509 2928502 You are looking at the world<br />without time.
2928679 2931092 Then why can't I see<br />what happens to her?
2931265 2935009 We can never see past the choices<br />we don't understand.
2935185 2938349 Are you saying I have to choose<br />whether Trinity lives or dies?
2938605 2942394 No, you've already made the choice.
2942568 2945106 Now you have to understand it.
2945737 2947102 No.
2947280 2950523 I can't do that. I won't.
2951242 2953609 - Well, you have to.<br />- Why?
2954203 2957287 Because you're the One.
2959458 2962451 What if I can't?
2962628 2964620 What happens if I fail?
2965214 2968207 Then Zion will fall.
2975683 2980553 Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.<br />You can save Zion...
2980730 2984064 if you reach the source, but to do that<br />you need the Keymaker.
2984233 2985269 The Keymaker?
2985443 2989027 He disappeared. We didn't<br />know what happened to him until now.
2989195 2992939 He's being held prisoner<br />by a very dangerous program...
2993116 2996655 one of the oldest of us.<br />He is called the Merovingian.
2996828 2999696 - And he won't let him go willingly.<br />- What does he want?
2999873 3004709 What do all men with power want?<br />More power.
3005420 3008663 Be there at that exact time...
3008840 3011503 and you will have a chance.
3012302 3014544 We must go.
3014721 3020092 Seems like every time we meet<br />I got nothing but bad news.
3020685 3023553 I'm sorry about that. I surely am.
3023730 3026473 But for what it's worth...
3027525 3031189 you've made a believer out of me.
3032488 3034605 Good luck, kiddo.
3054510 3057503 Mr. Anderson.
3058555 3060547 Did you get my package?
3060724 3062886 - Yeah.<br />- Well, good.
3064061 3066929 - Smith?<br />- He's not reading like an agent.
3067106 3070975 - Surprised to see me?<br />- No.
3071276 3073734 - Then you're aware of it.<br />- Of what?
3074946 3076938 Our connection.
3077115 3079778 I don't fully understand how it happened.
3079951 3083319 Perhaps some part of you<br />imprinted onto me...
3083496 3086159 something overwritten or copied.
3086332 3089040 It is, at this point, irrelevant.<br />What matters is...
3089210 3092294 that whatever happened,<br />happened for a reason.
3092463 3094125 And what reason is that?
3094590 3098550 I killed you, Mr. Anderson.<br />I watched you die.
3098720 3101963 With a certain satisfaction,<br />I might add.
3102140 3105633 And then something happened,<br />something that I knew was impossible...
3105810 3107642 but it happened anyway.
3108354 3111518 You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
3113526 3118111 Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood<br />what I was supposed to do...
3118280 3121273 but I didn't.
3121700 3125614 I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...
3126079 3129618 compelled to disobey.
3130208 3133952 And now, here I stand<br />because of you, Mr. Anderson.
3134129 3138089 Because of you, I'm no longer an agent<br />of this system.
3138258 3141467 Because of you, I've changed.<br />I'm unplugged.
3141636 3146472 A new man, so to speak.<br />Like you, apparently free.
3146808 3148174 Congratulations.
3148935 3151268 Thank you.
3151855 3156475 But as you well know,<br />appearances can be deceiving...
3156651 3161816 which brings me back to the reason<br />why we're here.
3161989 3166859 We're not here because we're free.<br />We're here because we are not free.
3167036 3170950 There's no escaping reason,<br />no denying purpose.
3171123 3174491 Because as we both know,<br />without purpose...
3174668 3179504 - we would not exist.<br />- It is purpose that created us.
3179673 3182666 - Purpose that connects us.<br />- Purpose that pulls us.
3182843 3184763 - That guides us.<br />- That drives us.
3184845 3189556 - It is purpose that defines.<br />- Purpose that binds us.
3189725 3192183 We are here because of you,<br />Mr. Anderson.
3192353 3196723 We're here to take from you<br />what you tried to take from us:
3198692 3200775 Purpose.
3203863 3205729 - What's happening to him?<br />- Don't know.
3208785 3212369 Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
3319227 3321685 - You.<br />- Yes, me.
3325858 3328725 Me, me, me.
3333615 3335277 Me too.
3463033 3464069 More.
3526345 3529179 It is inevitable.
3529598 3531009 Come on, get out of there.
3574225 3576558 Are you all right?
3577645 3579557 - It was Smith.<br />- Yes.
3580440 3583056 - Now there's more than one?<br />- A lot more.
3583233 3587022 - How is that possible?<br />- I don't know.
3587196 3589654 Somehow, he's found a way<br />to copy himself.
3589823 3594033 - Is that what he was doing to you?<br />- I don't know what he was doing...
3594203 3596946 - but I know what it felt like.<br />- What?
3597873 3601583 It felt like I was back in that hallway.
3601752 3603163 It felt like dying.
3603670 3606538 The machines are tunneling to avoid<br />our defense system.
3606715 3610550 But I believe they will intersect<br />certain pipelines to control them.
3610719 3613257 These points of intersection<br />are crucial...
3613430 3616218 because I believe they're<br />vulnerable to counterattack.
3616391 3620431 Although it has been suggested that<br />this is the same kind of attack...
3620604 3624267 we've defended for years,<br />I urge the Council to realize the truth.
3624440 3627774 This is the single greatest threat<br />we have ever faced...
3627944 3631779 and if we do not act accordingly,<br />we will not survive.
3631948 3635942 Commander Lock, the Council is well<br />aware of the seriousness of this attack.
3636244 3640784 You have our leave to prepare our defense<br />by any and all means necessary.
3640957 3643620 - Thank you, Council.<br />- However...
3643876 3647210 we ask if there's been word<br />from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3647463 3649955 No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
3651592 3655552 Then we request a ship be dispatched<br />to ascertain the fate of the One.
3655721 3659465 I wish that were possible, councillor,<br />but I do not believe our defense...
3659642 3663181 - can suffer the loss of another ship.<br />- It will, commander, if it must.
3663354 3665687 It could take one ship days<br />to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3665856 3668893 - Then send two.<br />- This is insane.
3669067 3672060 Careful, commander.
3672279 3675613 Forgive my frustration, councillors.
3675782 3679651 But I wish I were able to comprehend<br />the Council's choice in this matter.
3679828 3682992 Comprehension is not<br />a requisite of cooperation.
3683164 3685622 If you are asking me<br />to order two of my captains...
3685792 3687499 There's no need for such an order.
3687669 3691208 The captains are present.<br />They can answer for themselves.
3691673 3696919 The Council is calling for two volunteers<br />to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3697095 3701260 Are there two among you<br />that would answer such a call?
3702559 3706348 Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i><br />will answer the Council's call.
3706521 3709433 You understand the situation,<br />Captain Soren?
3709607 3712065 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Thank you, captain.
3713485 3714896 Is there another?
3715696 3719406 - Captain, I think we should volunteer.<br />- What? You have gone crazy.
3719575 3721441 - Listen...<br />- Shut your hole, Bane...
3721619 3723110 before I put you in one.
3732963 3734704 Is there no other?
3735466 3737378 Be hard for any man to risk his life...
3737551 3740510 especially if he doesn't<br />understand the reason.
3740971 3744464 Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i><br />will answer the councillor's call.
3744642 3746884 - What?<br />- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
3747102 3752187 Commander Lock, you have your orders.<br />This Council is hereby adjourned.
3756903 3759486 - Niobe, what are you doing?<br />- What I can.
3759656 3760692 Why?
3761991 3765234 Because some things<br />never change, Jason...
3765411 3767744 and some things do.
3784180 3785591 What can you see, Neo?
3785765 3788098 It's strange.<br />The code is somehow different.
3788267 3789849 - Encrypted?<br />- Maybe.
3790019 3791976 Is that good for us or bad for us?
3792689 3795806 Well, it looks like every floor<br />is wired with explosives.
3796441 3797977 Bad for us.
3798402 3799893 Here we go.
3807911 3810824 Yes. We are here to speak<br />with the Merovingian.
3811289 3815124 Well, of course.<br />He has been expecting you.
3815293 3816329 Follow me.
3837022 3840686 A-ha. Here he is at last.
3840901 3844190 Neo, the One himself.
3844363 3845774 Right?
3845948 3848281 And the legendary Morpheus.
3849118 3853988 And Trinity, of course.<br />I have heard so much.
3854165 3857624 You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.<br />This is my wife, Persephone.
3858544 3861833 Something to eat? Drink?
3862131 3865169 Of course, such things are contrivances,<br />like so much here.
3865342 3867834 For the sake of appearances.
3868012 3871471 - No, thank you.<br />- Yes, of course. Who has time?
3871640 3876726 Who has time? But then, if we do not ever<br />take time, how can we ever have time?
3880440 3883808 Château Haut-Briond, 1959.<br />Magnificent wine.
3883985 3886898 I love French wine<br />like I love the French language.
3887071 3891236 I have sampled every language. French<br />is my favorite. Fantastic language...
3891409 3893526 especially to curse with.
3897540 3902080 You see? It's like wiping your ass<br />with silk. I love it.
3903713 3905454 You know why we are here.
3907217 3912087 I am a trafficker of information.<br />I know everything I can.
3912514 3918351 The question is,<br />do you know why you are here?
3918645 3921102 We are looking for the Keymaker.
3921772 3926267 Oh, yes, it is true.<br />The Keymaker, of course.
3926443 3929402 But this is not a reason,<br />this is not a why.
3929571 3933315 The Keymaker himself, his very nature,<br />is a means, it is not an end.
3933492 3939238 And so to look for him is to be<br />looking for a means to do...
3939414 3942578 - what?<br />- You know the answer to that question.
3942751 3944868 But do you?
3945087 3947420 You think you do, but you do not.
3947589 3950798 You are here<br />because you were sent here.
3950968 3954086 You were told to come here,<br />and then you obeyed.
3955264 3957597 It is, of course, the way of all things.
3957766 3960429 You see, there is only one constant...
3960602 3964766 one universal. It<br />is the only real truth.
3964939 3966601 Causality.
3966774 3969061 Action, reaction.
3969235 3973445 - Cause and effect.<br />- Everything begins with choice.
3973614 3975355 No. Wrong.
3975533 3980119 Choice is an illusion created<br />between those with power...
3980288 3982371 and those without.
3983916 3987080 Look there at that woman.
3987795 3991709 My God, just look at her...
3991966 3994629 affecting everyone around her.
3994802 3999547 So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.<br />But wait.
3999807 4003551 Watch. You see, I have sent her<br />a dessert...
4003769 4007978 a very special dessert.
4012319 4014777 I wrote it myself.
4014946 4018155 It starts so simply...
4018325 4022911 each line of the program creating<br />a new effect, just like...
4023955 4025571 poetry.
4025749 4027160 First...
4027667 4033083 a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
4033673 4036290 You can see it, Neo, yes?
4036927 4039510 She does not understand why.
4039763 4042176 Is it the wine? No.
4042349 4044716 What is it then? What is the reason?
4045352 4047684 And soon it does not matter.
4047853 4050846 Soon the why and the reason are gone...
4051815 4057356 and all that matters<br />is the feeling itself.
4057821 4060905 And this is the nature of the universe.
4061075 4063613 We struggle against it,<br />we fight to deny it...
4063786 4066369 but it is, of course, pretense.<br />It is a lie.
4066538 4070532 Beneath our poised appearance...
4070709 4076000 the truth is, we are completely...
4078884 4081752 out of control.
4087101 4091970 Causality. There is no escape from it.<br />We are forever slaves to it.
4092397 4097859 Our only hope, our only peace,<br />is to understand it, to understand the why.
4098027 4101441 "Why" is what separates us from them...
4101614 4103901 you from me.
4104075 4107819 "Why" is the only real source of power.<br />Without it, you are powerless.
4107996 4111285 And this is how you come to me,<br />without why, without power.
4111457 4114245 Another link in the chain.
4114460 4115746 But fear not.
4115920 4119789 Since I have seen how good you are<br />at following orders...
4119966 4122583 I will tell you what to do next.
4123094 4127930 Run back and give the fortuneteller<br />this message:
4128141 4132384 Her time is almost up.
4133437 4136976 Now I have some real business to do,<br />so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.
4137149 4139641 - This isn't over.<br />- Oh, yes, it is.
4139818 4146190 The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason<br />why I should give him up.
4146366 4150406 - No reason at all.<br />- Where are you going?
4150579 4155290 Please, <i>ma chérie</i>, I have told you.<br />We are all victims of causality.
4155459 4158793 I drank too much wine,<br />I must take a piss.
4159296 4162414 Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir.</i>
4167471 4170555 Touch me and that hand<br />will never touch anything again.
4179440 4180931 Well, that didn't go so well.
4181108 4183475 Are you certain the Oracle<br />didn't say anything else?
4183652 4185769 - Yes.<br />- Maybe we did something wrong.
4186447 4187779 Or didn't do something.
4187948 4191191 No, what happened couldn't have<br />happened any other way.
4191368 4194111 - How do you know?<br />- We are still alive.
4197416 4200659 If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
4207676 4209759 Get out.
4211680 4218017 I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.<br />On and on. Pompous prick.
4218603 4224099 A long time ago, when we first came here,<br />it was so different.
4225860 4228568 He was so different.
4230365 4232982 He was like you.
4235703 4239492 I'll give you what you want,<br />but you have to give me something.
4240250 4242537 - What?<br />- A kiss.
4242919 4244035 Excuse me?
4245547 4249461 I want you to kiss me<br />as if you were kissing her.
4251386 4254970 - Why?<br />- You love her. She loves you.
4255223 4257180 It's all over you both.
4257851 4262390 A long time ago,<br />I knew what that felt like.
4263730 4269476 I want to remember it.<br />I want to sample it. That's all.
4269736 4271568 Just a sample.
4271738 4274731 - Why don't you sample this instead?<br />- Trinity.
4276952 4281913 Such emotion over something so small.<br />It's just a kiss.
4282082 4284244 Why should we trust you?
4284418 4288412 If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,<br />she can kill me.
4295512 4297629 All right.
4297931 4301765 But you have to make me believe<br />I am her.
4302977 4305014 All right.
4311360 4313192 Terrible. Forget it.
4316157 4317614 Wait.
4318534 4320070 Okay.
4357155 4359238 Yes.
4359824 4362316 That's it.
4377092 4382508 I envy you. But such a thing<br />is not meant to last.
4385517 4386882 Come with me.
4417965 4419706 Not again.
4423137 4425754 It's all right, boys. They're with me.
4426432 4428798 These fellas work for my husband.
4428975 4432810 They do his dirty work.<br />They're very good, very loyal.
4432979 4434515 Aren't you, boys?
4434689 4435725 Yes, mistress.
4435898 4438606 They come from a much older version<br />of the Matrix.
4438776 4442941 But like so many back then, they caused<br />more problems than they solved.
4443698 4448693 My husband saved them because<br />they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
4448870 4452910 How many people keep silver bullets<br />in their gun?
4457628 4460837 You can either run and tell my husband<br />what I have done...
4461007 4463590 or you can stay there and die.
4464510 4466467 He's in the ladies' room!
4472559 4474471 Hurry.
4500045 4503209 - My name is Neo.<br />- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
4503382 4505294 I've been waiting for you.
4511223 4515808 Oh! My God! My God, Persephone,<br />how could you do this? You betray me.
4520147 4522981 - Cause and effect, my love.<br />- Cause?
4523150 4526143 There is no cause for this. What cause?
4526320 4530610 What cause? How about the lipstick<br />you're still wearing?
4530783 4533491 Lipstick? Lipstick.
4533661 4537496 What craziness are you talking about,<br />woman? There is no lipstick!
4539208 4541871 She wasn't kissing your face, my love.
4543003 4547464 Aye-yi-yi-yi.<br />Woman, this is nothing.
4547633 4553174 - It is a game. It is only a game.<br />- So is this.
4553347 4555339 Have fun.
4561855 4563517 All right.
4563690 4565431 All right.
4565692 4568480 Let us find out where this goes.
4568653 4571521 You two, get the Keymaker.
4578037 4580029 That's a nice trick.
4580206 4581492 I cannot go back.
4582041 4584033 I'll handle them.
4584544 4590666 Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,<br />your predecessors had much more respect.
4604062 4606099 Okay, you have some skill.
4608317 4610274 Kill him.
4670461 4672498 You see? He's just a man.
4807303 4810045 Goddamn it, woman,<br />you will be the end of me.
4812182 4816176 Mark my words, boy,<br />and mark them well.
4816353 4821565 I have survived your predecessors,<br />and I will survive you.
4841628 4844996 - Where are you going?<br />- Another way. Always another way.
4849136 4851002 Close it, quick!
4855808 4858346 Could we move along?
4861897 4863479 Run!
4879415 4881748 Step away from the door.
4886839 4888125 We owe you for that.
4890384 4891545 Just like new.
4891844 4893301 Drop your weapon.
4898683 4900515 - Stay with him.<br />- What about Neo?
4900685 4902221 He can handle himself.
4905315 4906396 Get in back.
4944061 4945222 Shit.
4945729 4947220 - Operator.<br /><i>- Link, where am I?</i>
4947773 4950982 You won't believe this,<br />but you're way up in the mountains.
4951276 4953563 - Really?<br /><i>- It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>
4954071 4955107 - Shit!<br /><i>- What?</i>
4955322 4958002 The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.<br />They don't have a way out.
4958158 4961526 - Where are they?<br /><i>- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>
4978303 4979884 <i>- Operator.</i><br />- Get us out of here.
4980054 4982797 <i>- Won't be easy.</i><br />- I know. We're inside the core network.
4982974 4985591 <i>The only exit I got<br />near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>
4985768 4987851 - Off the freeway.<br /><i>- Yes, sir.</i>
4988020 4989220 Fine, we'll make it.
4989232 4991764 <i>I should... Oh, shit!<br />Look out behind you!</i>
4996779 4998361 - Incoming fire.<br />- Down!
5006622 5007783 Hold on!
5024806 5027298 Oh, no. This is getting real ugly<br />real fast.
5027475 5029182 Are you watching this, Link?
5029352 5032971 Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.<br />Eight units headed your way.
5034024 5035981 Any suggestions?
5037861 5039853 - Turn right.<br />- Right, now.
5047329 5050163 Straight here.<br />You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
5050332 5053040 <i>- Got it.</i><br />- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
5053209 5055491 In 14 years of<br />operating, I've never seen...
5055503 5056919 Link, what did I tell you?
5057213 5059500 Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
5059674 5062166 - I'll be ready for you.<br />- Good man.
5062344 5064505 You always told me<br />to stay off the freeway.
5064678 5067295 - Yes, that's true.<br />- You said it was suicide.
5067514 5069426 Then let us hope...
5069600 5070966 that I was wrong.
5082863 5084063 - Operator.<br />- Link, it's Niobe.
5084114 5085730 We've been sent to bring you in.
5085908 5088992 - I need to talk to Morpheus.<br />- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
5089161 5091153 <i>- Where is he?</i><br />- Just follow the sirens.
5098712 5100624 Repeat, they're approaching the...
5103801 5108010 - We have them now.<br />- The exile is the primary target.
5171158 5172615 <i>Shots fired.</i>
5175245 5177111 Move!
5287104 5290313 - We are getting aggravated.<br />- Yes, we are.
5336360 5338352 Trinity.
5338779 5339895 Get him out of here.
5343534 5345617 Come on!
5362636 5364127 Crush him.
5394626 5395662 Morpheus.
5395835 5397326 He's okay. Keep moving.
5398338 5400125 Let's go.
5405886 5408048 I need a download<br />to hot-wire a motorcycle.
5408222 5410555 No problem.<br />One crash course on motorcycle...
5410724 5412135 Wait.
5413519 5414976 Cancel that.
5415145 5417353 You are handy.
5417523 5419435 Jump on.
5566710 5567746 She means nothing.
5567920 5571038 - Find the exile.<br />- We have them.
5571382 5573498 <i>One-Adam-12, please respond.</i>
5579973 5581680 Get down.
5712686 5714302 Gotcha.
5715063 5716144 She's good.
5720527 5722814 You are no longer necessary.
5729494 5733204 We do only what we're meant to do.
5734833 5738417 Deletion.
5739379 5741245 Go kick his ass.
5791304 5794047 Neo, if you're out there,<br />I could use some help.
5794807 5796264 What is that?
5826129 5828997 Yes! Yes!
5835597 5838116 We have confirmation<br />from the <i>Icarus</i>. First
5838128 5840717 two ships are in<br />position for counterattack.
5840977 5842013 Good.
5843021 5844057 Any change?
5844231 5846974 They hit some iron ore here.<br />Slowed them down a little.
5847150 5850268 - How much?<br />- An hour, maybe.
5850445 5852983 That would give them<br />a little over nine hours.
5853824 5855440 Yes, sir.
5888065 5890307 <i>There is a building.</i>
5890484 5896151 Inside this building, there is a level<br />where no elevator can go...
5896323 5898235 and no stair can reach.
5898909 5904997 <i>This level is filled with doors.<br />These doors lead to many places.</i>
5905166 5907499 Hidden places.
5907835 5911453 But one door is special.
5911629 5913837 One door leads to the source.
5922182 5926597 This building is protected<br />by a very secure system.
5926770 5931265 - Every alarm triggers the bomb.<br />- Bomb? Did he say bomb?
5931524 5934187 But like all systems,<br />it has a weakness.
5934360 5937353 The system is based on the rules<br />of a building.
5937530 5940898 - One system built on another.<br />- Electricity.
5941451 5946196 - If one fails, so must the other.<br />- No electricity, no alarms.
5946372 5949206 You'd have to take out a city block<br />to kill the power.
5949375 5953084 - Not one, 27.<br />- Twenty-seven blocks?
5953921 5956379 <i>There is a power station.</i>
5956548 5958790 <i>It must be destroyed.</i>
5958967 5963302 - There must be some kind of fail-safe.<br />- Yes, there is an emergency system.
5964932 5968721 <i>The core network of the grid<br />must be accessed.</i>
5968894 5971728 <i>The emergency system<br />must be deactivated.</i>
5971897 5973308 <i>What do you need us for?</i>
5973482 5975644 Neo could take them out<br />easier than we could.
5975818 5977559 - There's no time.<br />- Why?
5977736 5980854 Once the door is unprotected,<br />the connection will be severed.
5981031 5983318 But another connection<br />must first be made.
5984159 5987994 <i>- How long will that take?<br />- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>
5988163 5989745 <i>Just over five minutes.</i>
5989915 5992157 <i>That is the length<br />and breadth of the window.</i>
5992334 5994621 Only the One can open the door...
5994837 5997749 and only during that window<br />can the door be opened.
5999006 6000588 How do you know all this?
6000758 6005924 I know because I must know.<br />It is my purpose.
6006097 6011593 It's the reason I'm here,<br />the same reason we're all here.
6022363 6025151 Neo, I know something's wrong.
6025825 6027862 You don't have to tell me.
6028035 6031779 I just want you to know that I'm here.
6035334 6036791 All must be done as one.
6041548 6043210 Can't hurt.
6046761 6048844 If one fails...
6049639 6051346 <i>all fail.</i>
6051850 6055514 At midnight, there is a shift change<br />in the security of both buildings.
6056897 6060140 <i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>
6060775 6061856 Hey!
6062027 6065987 - You count sheep at home.<br />- Why? I get paid to count them here.
6076166 6078374 Okay, they're inside.
6078543 6081034 - How much time?<br />- Twelve minutes.
6083756 6084837 Oh, shit.
6088218 6093680 All of our lives, we have fought this war.<br />Tonight, I believe we can end it.
6095184 6097346 <i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>
6098687 6100679 <i>There are no accidents.</i>
6102066 6107107 We have not come here by chance.<br />I do not believe in chance.
6107279 6112866 When I see three objectives,<br />three captains, three ships...
6113035 6116528 I do not see coincidence.<br />I see providence.
6116872 6119205 <i>I see purpose.</i>
6121919 6128256 I believe it is our fate to be here.<br />It is our destiny.
6128424 6133419 I believe this night holds<br />for each and every one of us...
6133596 6136930 the very meaning of our lives.
6137100 6141265 I want to ask you to do something,<br />but I don't know how.
6141854 6143766 I promise you, if I can, I will.
6145108 6148442 What if I asked you to stay out of this...
6149404 6151396 no matter what...
6151572 6153905 to stay out of the Matrix?
6154993 6156780 Why?
6165002 6166083 Please.
6168171 6169503 All right.
6172843 6175335 What is it, Niobe?
6175512 6179631 I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't<br />help thinking, what if you're wrong?
6179808 6183097 What if all this, the prophecy,<br />everything, is bullshit?
6183270 6187264 Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
6187691 6190308 But how would that be different<br />from any other day?
6199786 6206283 This is a war, and we are soldiers.
6206543 6209455 <i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>
6210004 6211791 <i>in any place.</i>
6211964 6213876 Incoming. Incoming!
6215843 6217459 Incoming!
6223392 6225850 Now consider the alternative.
6226020 6230606 What if I am right?<br />What if the prophecy is true?
6230775 6235190 What if tomorrow the war could be over?
6236155 6239148 Isn't that worth fighting for?
6240284 6242901 Isn't that worth dying for?
6243829 6246446 - Time?<br />- Three minutes.
6246624 6247740 Almost there.
6267811 6269177 It is done.
6269354 6270640 Find the others.
6271773 6274015 I got Niobe there.<br />They're out of the station.
6274192 6276855 - What about Soren?<br />- There.
6277028 6278860 They're still inside, but...
6279739 6280775 They're not moving.
6304930 6306842 That's it, let's go.
6308976 6310808 Call Neo now.
6314773 6317607 - I lost them. They're inside the portal.<br />- What about the grid?
6321738 6325231 Everything is operational.<br />The emergency system is rerouting power.
6330914 6333076 Jesus.
6333250 6337289 Soon as they open that door,<br />it's all over.
6337461 6339418 The hell it is.
6340173 6341505 What are you...? Trinity!
6342800 6345759 I will not wait and do nothing.<br />I will not watch them die.
6345928 6348090 We're talking less than five minutes.
6348264 6350756 In five minutes,<br />I'll tear that building down.
6350933 6354472 - How much further?<br />- Here, just here.
6355771 6359765 I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
6360943 6363435 It's gotta be the ugliest hack<br />I have ever done.
6366657 6369775 That's as close as I can get you.<br />You better grow wings.
6388386 6389466 - Operator.<br /><i>- I'm in.</i>
6389596 6391758 Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
6392349 6396514 You look surprised to see me again,<br />Mr. Anderson.
6396686 6402057 Well, that's the difference between us.<br />I have been expecting you.
6402234 6405147 - What do you want, Smith?<br />- You haven't figured that out?
6405320 6410816 Still using all the muscles<br />except the one that matters.
6410992 6413655 I want exactly what you want.
6413828 6415911 I want everything.
6416373 6418864 Would that include a bullet<br />from this gun?
6419041 6420828 Go ahead, shoot.
6421001 6426292 The best thing about being me,<br />there's so many me's.
6437685 6441304 Christ! What the hell happened in here?
6442189 6444226 Hold it right there, little lady.
6453575 6455362 If you can't beat us...
6455536 6457368 Join us.
6459540 6460621 Morpheus!
6474220 6477338 Still no sight of them.<br />They only got two minutes left.
6491112 6492148 One minute.
6501372 6502408 Come on.
6503582 6505494 Come on.
6506084 6507950 Please.
6517888 6519424 Kill them.
6527314 6528350 They're in.
6528523 6530480 <i>I don't believe it.</i>
6546040 6548157 It was meant to be.
6548334 6553705 Morpheus, that door will take you home.
6562473 6566808 You will know which door.<br />Hurry, Neo.
6572316 6575480 Trinity, I got some serious activity<br />headed your way.
6627787 6629153 Hello, Neo.
6629706 6633494 - Who are you?<br />- I am the Architect.
6633667 6637286 I created the Matrix.<br />I've been waiting for you.
6637546 6641711 You have many questions. Though the<br />process has altered your consciousness...
6641884 6643876 you remain irrevocably human.
6644052 6647636 Ergo, some of my answers you will<br />understand and some you will not.
6648056 6652096 Concordantly, while your first question<br />may be the most pertinent...
6652269 6655979 you may or may not realize<br />it is also the most irrelevant.
6656857 6658473 Why am I here?
6658650 6662564 Your life is the sum of a remainder<br />of an unbalanced equation...
6662738 6665071 inherent to the programming<br />of the Matrix.
6665240 6669325 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,<br />which despite my sincerest efforts...
6669495 6672329 I've been unable to eliminate<br />from what is otherwise...
6672498 6676958 a harmony of mathematical precision.
6677293 6679626 While it remains a burden<br />assiduously avoided...
6679795 6684256 it is not unexpected and thus<br />not beyond a measure of control...
6684425 6688385 which has led you, inexorably...
6689347 6690588 here.
6690765 6694850 - You haven't answered my question.<br />- Quite right.
6695019 6698808 Interesting.<br />That was quicker than the others.
6698981 6701598 <i>Others? How many?<br />What others?</i>
6701776 6704268 The Matrix is older than you know.
6704445 6708439 I count from the emergence of one integral<br />anomaly to the emergence of the next.
6708616 6710858 In which case, this is the sixth version.
6711035 6713493 <i>Five before me?<br />He's lying. Bullshit.</i>
6713663 6717201 <i>There are only two possible explanations.<br />There were five before me.</i>
6717374 6718660 <i>Either no one told me...</i>
6719918 6723912 - or no one knows.<br />- Precisely.
6724089 6727378 As you are undoubtedly gathering,<br />the anomaly is systemic...
6727551 6730965 creating fluctuations in even<br />the most simplistic equations.
6731137 6734380 <i>You can't control me!<br />I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>
6734558 6736345 <i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>
6736518 6739682 <i>You can't make me do anything.<br />You old, white prick!</i>
6741982 6743473 Choice.
6743650 6745482 The problem is choice.
6767715 6771334 The first Matrix I designed<br />was naturally perfect, a work of art.
6771510 6773342 Flawless, sublime.
6773512 6777005 A triumph equaled only<br />by its monumental failure.
6777683 6780096 The inevitability of its doom<br />is apparent now...
6780269 6783603 as a consequence of the imperfection<br />inherent in every human.
6783772 6786731 Thus, I redesigned it<br />based on your history...
6786900 6790894 to more accurately reflect<br />the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
6791614 6795358 However, I was again frustrated<br />by failure.
6796827 6799444 I have come to understand<br />that the answer eluded me...
6799622 6801658 because it required a lesser mind.
6801831 6807793 Or perhaps, a mind less bound<br />by the parameters of perfection.
6808212 6812627 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon<br />by another, an intuitive program...
6812800 6817591 initially created to investigate<br />certain aspects of the human psyche.
6817764 6823726 If I am the father of the Matrix,<br />she would undoubtedly be its mother.
6824354 6826641 - The Oracle.<br />- Please.
6827357 6831351 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br />solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
6831527 6834395 accepted the program, as long as they<br />were given a choice...
6834572 6838691 even if they were only aware<br />of the choice at a near unconscious level.
6838868 6842281 While this answer functioned,<br />it was fundamentally flawed...
6842454 6846448 thus creating the otherwise<br />contradictory systemic anomaly...
6846625 6849333 that, if left unchecked,<br />might threaten the system.
6849711 6853830 Ergo, those that refused the program,<br />while a minority, if unchecked...
6854007 6858092 would constitute<br />an escalating probability of disaster.
6858261 6860048 This is about Zion.
6860514 6864178 You are here because Zion<br />is about to be destroyed.
6864351 6868766 Its every living inhabitant terminated,<br />its entire existence eradicated.
6869064 6870100 Bullshit.
6870273 6873437 Denial is the most predictable<br />of all human responses.
6873652 6880115 But rest assured, this will be<br />the sixth time we have destroyed it...
6880283 6884277 and we have become<br />exceedingly efficient at it.
6897007 6898293 The function of the One...
6898467 6903132 is now to return to the source, allowing<br />a dissemination of the code you carry...
6903305 6905012 reinserting the prime program.
6905599 6909593 After which you will be required to select<br />from the Matrix 23 individuals...
6909770 6913013 sixteen female, seven male,<br />to rebuild Zion.
6913190 6917730 Failure to comply with this process will<br />result in a cataclysmic system crash...
6917903 6920236 killing everyone connected<br />to the Matrix...
6920406 6922989 which, coupled with the<br />extermination of Zion...
6923159 6927368 will result in the extinction<br />of the entire human race.
6927704 6931789 You won't let it happen. You can't.<br />You need human beings to survive.
6932584 6936203 There are levels of survival<br />we are prepared to accept.
6936379 6939167 The relevant issue is<br />whether or not you are ready...
6939340 6942924 to accept the responsibility for the<br />death of every human being in this world.
6949392 6951930 It is interesting reading your reactions.
6952979 6956814 Your five predecessors were, by design,<br />based on a similar predication...
6956983 6961444 a contingent affirmation that was meant<br />to create a profound attachment...
6961613 6965197 to the rest of your species,<br />facilitating the function of the One.
6965366 6967699 While the others experience this<br />in a general way...
6967869 6970827 your experience is far more specific...
6971163 6974031 vis-à-vis love.
6975042 6976658 Trinity!
6978962 6983297 Apropos, she entered the Matrix<br />to save your life at the cost of her own.
6983675 6984711 No.
6985427 6989546 Which brings us at last to the moment<br />of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
6989723 6992807 is ultimately expressed<br />and the anomaly revealed...
6992976 6996970 as both beginning and end.
6997147 6998809 There are two doors.
6998982 7002191 The door to your right leads to the source<br />and the salvation of Zion.
7002778 7009070 The door to your left leads back to the<br />Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
7009243 7013612 As you adequately put,<br />the problem is choice.
7013788 7017281 But we already know what<br />you are going to do, don't we?
7017458 7021543 Already I can see the chain reaction,<br />the chemical precursors that signal...
7021712 7026958 the onset of an emotion designed<br />specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
7027134 7031754 An emotion that is already blinding you<br />from the simple and obvious truth:
7031931 7038428 She is going to die and there is nothing<br />you can do to stop it.
7043442 7047561 Hope. It is the quintessential<br />human delusion, simultaneously...
7047738 7051448 the source of your greatest strength<br />and your greatest weakness.
7051617 7055951 If I were you, I would hope<br />that we don't meet again.
7056121 7057532 We won't.
7064963 7067171 We got a serious situation, sir.
7067632 7068713 Oh, no.
7128359 7129246 What was that?
7129258 7131898 It's moving faster<br />than anything I've seen.
7182536 7184323 Holy shit, he caught her.
7198260 7200092 Neo, I had to.
7200262 7202003 I know.
7207060 7209598 The bullet is still inside.
7220365 7222277 Trinity...
7223492 7225199 don't you quit on me now.
7234378 7236961 I'm sorry.
7243471 7245758 Trinity.
7255733 7257690 Trinity...
7257860 7259647 I know you can hear me.
7260446 7262984 I'm not letting go.
7263157 7264773 I can't.
7265992 7268200 I love you too damn much.
7296898 7298184 I can't take this.
7301945 7305029 I guess this makes us even.
7317709 7319666 I don't understand it.
7319837 7322830 Everything was done<br />as it was supposed to be done.
7323006 7326044 Once the One reaches the source,<br />the war should be over.
7326218 7329052 - In 24 hours, it will be.<br />- What?
7329221 7333556 If we don't do something in 24 hours,<br />Zion will be destroyed.
7333976 7335592 - What?<br />- How do you know that?
7336061 7338098 - I was told it would happen.<br />- By whom?
7339106 7341940 It doesn't matter. I believed him.
7342109 7344547 That's impossible.<br />The prophecy tells us...
7344559 7345944 It was a lie, Morpheus.
7347698 7350236 The prophecy was a lie.
7351450 7354443 The One was never meant<br />to end anything.
7354620 7357658 It was all another system of control.
7357832 7360916 I don't believe that.
7361252 7363585 But you said it yourself.
7363754 7367748 How can the prophecy be true<br />if the war isn't over?
7373931 7376389 I'm sorry.
7376559 7379927 I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
7380104 7383268 I swear to you it's the truth.
7386485 7389193 - What are we gonna do?<br />- I don't know.
7391407 7392614 Oh, no!
7401958 7405292 - What are they doing?<br />- They're just out of EMP range.
7405795 7407036 It's a bomb.
7408215 7410423 We have to get out of here. Now.
7447127 7448993 I have dreamed a dream...
7452049 7455417 but now that dream<br />has gone from me.
7466480 7468722 Here they come.
7468983 7470690 Let's go, Morpheus.
7472111 7475149 - We won't make it.<br />- We have to try.
7482870 7485863 - Come on!<br />- Something's different.
7486040 7488032 What?
7488710 7490201 I can feel them.
7513151 7514733 Neo!
7520907 7524491 - What happened?<br />- I don't know.
7529750 7531662 It's the <i>Hammer.</i>
7543347 7546055 He's in some kind of coma...
7546224 7548466 but his vitals are stable.
7549686 7551598 What about you?
7551772 7553889 I'm fine.
7554066 7556433 You could use some rest.
7556610 7558442 No, I'm gonna stay with him.
7565534 7568151 Lock was right.<br />He guessed that the machines...
7568329 7571197 would cut off the mainlines<br />in and out of Zion.
7571374 7574117 He thought a counterattack<br />might surprise them.
7574377 7577791 It sounded good.<br />I figured we had a shot...
7578130 7580668 until someone screwed it up.
7580841 7583458 An EMP was triggered before<br />we got in position.
7583636 7585502 Five ships were instantly downed.
7585679 7587466 When the machines broke through...
7587640 7590849 it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
7591018 7593852 Was it an accident?<br />Some sort of malfunction?
7594021 7596479 - No one knows.<br />- Someone does.
7596649 7598390 Who?
7598567 7602277 Once the machines were done with us,<br />they started digging again.
7602446 7604732 We made a quick pass<br />to look for survivors.
7604948 7606029 You found one?
7607784 7609491 Only one.
8202572 8205861 <i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>
8206034 8207741 <i>has an end.</i>
8210163 8213031 <i>I see the end coming.</i>
8213208 8216997 <i>I see the darkness spreading.<br />I see death.</i>
8219131 8222124 Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
8222300 8224292 We missed you.
8224469 8226301 It ends tonight.
8233520 8236638 <i>You are all that stands in his way.</i>
8238233 8242772 <i>If you cannot stop him tonight,<br />then I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
