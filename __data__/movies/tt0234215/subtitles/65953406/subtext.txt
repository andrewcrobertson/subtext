89339 91174 See you tomorrow.
93260 95721 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARS]
110485 111528 Oh, my God!
134176 135677 I'm in.
248790 250584 We're almost there.
250751 254713 - Sir, are you sure about this?<br />- I told you, we're going to be all right.
254880 260343 I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping<br />some serious sentinel activity up here.
298507 300926 - Link.<br />- Yes, sir?
301092 304221 Given your situation, I can't say<br />I understand your reasons...
304387 307057 ...for volunteering to operate<br />on board my ship.
307224 311228 However, if you wish to continue to<br />do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
311770 313230 What's that, sir?
313980 315273 To trust me.
315440 317400 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
319444 322614 - I mean, I do, sir.<br />- I hope so.
322781 326159 Repatch the main AC to the hard drives<br />and stand by to broadcast.
326326 327410 Yes, sir.
327619 329454 [DOOR OPENS]
336253 338505 Still can't sleep?
340465 341842 You wanna talk?
344177 346555 They're just dreams.
348890 351268 If you're afraid of something...
351434 353270 I just wish...
353937 356189 I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
356356 358191 That's all.
359109 360694 I just wish I knew.
360861 365115 She's gonna call. Don't worry.
365282 366324 Here you are.
366491 369953 - Are we ready to go?<br />- We're already late.
370120 374749 These geotherms confirm<br />the last transmission of the <i>Osiris.</i>
375500 377168 The machines are digging.
378837 381131 They're boring from the surface<br />down to Zion.
381298 383884 - Mother...<br />- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
384050 385552 How fast are they moving?
385719 389097 Control estimates their descent<br />at 100 meters an hour.
389264 391725 MAN 1: How deep are they?<br />- Almost 2000 meters.
391892 395437 - What about the scans from the <i>Osiris?</i><br />- They can't be accurate.
395604 397522 - They may be.<br />- It's not possible.
397689 400150 That'd mean there are<br />a quarter-million sentinels.
400317 401818 -That's right.<br />MAN 2: That can't be.
401985 403653 MORPHEUS:<br />Why not?
403820 407574 A sentinel for every man,<br />woman and child in Zion.
408533 412495 That sounds exactly like<br />the thinking of a machine to me.
412662 414831 Morpheus, glad you could join us.
415332 416499 Niobe.
417876 421254 My apologies to all.<br />But as you are undoubtedly aware...
421421 424716 ...it's become difficult to locate<br />a secure broadcast position.
424883 428136 - Squiddies got our best spots.<br />- Lines are crawling with them.
428303 432098 And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours<br />there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
432265 433391 What are we gonna do?
433558 435852 We're gonna do what<br />Commander Lock ordered.
436186 438772 We'll evacuate broadcast level<br />and return to Zion.
438939 444069 And does the commander have a plan<br />for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
444235 446905 A strategy is still being formulated.
447072 448740 I'm sure it is.
463755 465757 MAN: What do you think<br />we should do, Morpheus?
465966 468093 MORPHEUS: Proceed as ordered...<br />- What is it?
468259 469302 I don't know.
469469 472263 MORPHEUS: ...however, I must<br />ask one of you for help.
472430 478144 Some of you believe as I believe, some<br />of you do not. Those of you that do...
478311 480855 ...know we are nearing<br />the end of our struggle.
481022 485276 The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.<br />But before it can be...
485443 488780 ...the Oracle must be consulted.
496705 498957 If we return and recharge now...
499124 502877 ...we can be back in 36 hours, well<br />before the machines reach this depth.
503086 504921 Do you understand what you're asking?
505088 507924 I am asking that one ship<br />remain here in our place...
508091 510802 ...in case the Oracle<br />should attempt to contact us.
510969 514097 Bullshit. You're asking one of us<br />to disobey a direct order.
514264 518810 That's right, I am. But we well know<br />that the reason most of us are here...
518977 521604 ...is because of our affinity<br />for disobedience.
521771 523690 What happens when you<br />get back to Zion...
523857 526276 ...and the commander<br />throws you in the stockade?
526443 527652 He won't.
528778 531990 Goddamn it, Morpheus,<br />you ain't never gonna change.
532699 535452 Shit, I'll do it just to see<br />what Deadbolt does to you.
535618 537162 You got 36 hours.
539956 541791 SMITH:<br />I'm looking for Neo.
541958 545336 - Never heard of him.<br />- I have something for him.
546546 548757 A gift.
548965 551843 You see, he set me free.
554137 556514 Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
557057 558099 Who was that?
558266 560101 MAN:<br />How did you know someone was here?
560268 561728 He gave you this.
567484 568902 He said you set him free.
570862 573198 Is everything all right, sir?
573823 576201 The meeting is over.<br />Retreat to your exits.
576367 578578 - Agents are coming.<br />- Agents?
579037 580413 Go.
580580 582373 [POUNDING]
590215 591299 Hiya, fellas.
591466 592592 AGENT 1: It's him.<br />- The anomaly.
592759 594010 - Do we proceed?<br />- Yes.
594177 596679 - He is still...<br />- Only human.
602852 605105 Hm. Upgrades.
660034 662579 -That went as expected.<br />SMITH 2: Yes.
662745 665415 It's happening exactly as before.
665582 668251 Well, not exactly.
671963 674090 -What happened?<br />LINK: I can't figure it out.
674257 675925 Agents just came out of nowhere.
676092 679095 Then the code got all weird.<br />Encryption I've never seen.
679262 682182 - Is Neo okay?<br />- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
682348 683766 Where is he now?
685226 686978 He's doing his Superman thing.
736945 738404 Where are you?
743076 746663 This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i><br />requesting access through Gate Three.
750708 755171 <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i> this is Zion Control.<br />Maintain present velocity and stand by.
755338 756839 LINK:<br /><i>Roger that, Control.</i>
757006 760510 This is Control requesting immediate<br />stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
761302 764514 We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i><br />on approach. Let's open her up.
770103 773022 <i>You are cleared through<br />Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>
773189 774899 Roger that, Control.
782031 785118 Door's open, bed's made.<br />Welcome home.
785868 788037 No place like it.
802218 805930 Roger that, Control. Zion Control,<br />stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
855438 857857 CONTROL: <i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.<br />Bay Seven.</i>
858024 859192 Understood.
869160 870453 Captain Mifune.
871537 872705 Captain Morpheus.
872872 875708 Are you here to escort me<br />to the stockade, captain?
875875 878252 - I'm just here to keep the peace.<br />- Commander Lock demands...
878419 880046 [MIFUNE CLEARS THROAT]
880546 883716 Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
884634 886469 - Link.<br />- Sir?
886636 889222 I want the ship ready to go<br />as soon as possible.
889389 890932 Understood, sir.
898106 900525 - What is it between them?<br />- Morpheus and Lock?
901651 903820 - Niobe.<br />- Captain Niobe?
903986 907198 She used to be with Morpheus.<br />Now she's with Lock.
908449 910034 What happened?
910243 913663 Morpheus went to the Oracle.<br />After that, everything changed.
913830 916499 Yeah, she can do that.
916666 917834 BOY:<br />Neo!
918835 921712 NEO: Oh, no.<br />- How does he always know?
921879 923840 Doesn't he have anything better to do?
924006 926717 You know what they say<br />about the life you save.
926884 928678 I didn't save his life.
930847 932223 Hiya, Neo.
933391 936018 -Trinity, Link.<br />LINK: Hey.
936185 939856 - It's great to have you back.<br />- Thanks. It's good to be back.
940022 942775 - Can I carry that for you?<br />- No, I can carry my own bag.
942942 944610 - Trinity?<br />- I'm fine.
945570 948448 - You can carry these.<br />- Yeah, sure, Link.
953369 957874 Hey, you know, next year<br />I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
958040 960793 I've been thinking about it,<br />and I've made my decision.
960960 962420 Let me guess.
962920 964881 I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
965882 969427 Morpheus hasn't filled the other<br />positions, except for you, Link.
969594 970970 I'm sure he has reasons...
971137 974474 ...but the more I think about it,<br />the more I think it's meant to be.
974640 976184 You know, it's fate.
976350 977894 You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
978060 980605 I told you, you found me.<br />I didn't find you.
980771 983316 I know, but you got me out.<br />You saved me.
984442 986068 You saved yourself.
1002376 1005671 -Morpheus.<br />MORPHEUS: Commander Lock.
1005922 1010426 I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to<br />offer you a chance to explain your actions.
1010593 1013471 I wasn't aware that my actions<br />required any explanation.
1013638 1015932 You were given an order<br />to return to Zion.
1016098 1018935 - I did.<br />- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
1019101 1021771 I would have stayed,<br />but I needed to recharge my ship.
1021938 1024649 So you admit to a direct contravention<br />of your duty.
1024815 1028236 We need a presence inside the Matrix<br />to await contact from the Oracle.
1028402 1030363 I don't want to hear that shit!
1030530 1033199 I don't care about oracles<br />or prophecies or messiahs!
1033366 1036786 I care about one thing: Stopping that<br />army from destroying this city.
1036953 1039789 To do that I need soldiers<br />to obey my orders.
1039956 1044544 With all due respect, commander,<br />there is only one way to save our city.
1044710 1046128 How?
1046295 1049090 - Neo.<br />- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
1049257 1051884 Not everyone believes what you believe.
1052051 1054136 My beliefs do not require them to.
1062311 1066232 There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's<br />talking. A lot of people are scared.
1066399 1069151 No one remembers the last time<br />so many ships were docked.
1069318 1072280 - Something big is happening, isn't it?<br />- Hey.
1072446 1075616 We're not allowed to say anything,<br />so stop asking.
1080913 1084041 Goddamn, it's good to be home.
1097054 1100016 I'm recommending that you<br />be removed from duty.
1100182 1102518 That is, of course,<br />your prerogative, commander.
1102685 1106564 If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot<br />on a ship for the rest of your life.
1106731 1109483 Then I am grateful that<br />it is not up to you.
1109650 1111110 [DOOR OPENS]
1115948 1118367 - Councillor Hamann.<br />- Commander.
1119035 1121746 - Captain.<br />- Councillor.
1121912 1125291 Council's asked me to speak tonight<br />at the temple gathering.
1125458 1129545 The presence of the fleet and the<br />persistence of rumors must be addressed.
1129712 1132214 The people must be told<br />what is happening.
1132381 1134091 Of course, councillor.
1134800 1140056 But might I advise a level of discretion<br />concerning specific details.
1140222 1143225 - We do not wish to start a panic.<br />- Quite right.
1143392 1146479 A panic is not what anyone wants.
1146646 1149982 What about you, captain?<br />What would you advise?
1152401 1157156 The truth. No one will panic,<br />because there is nothing to fear.
1157323 1159450 That army won't reach<br />the gates of Zion.
1160242 1163829 - What makes you so sure?<br />- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
1163996 1165873 Consider that in the past six months...
1166040 1168084 ...we have freed more minds<br />than in six years.
1168250 1171253 This attack is an act of desperation.
1171420 1175257 I believe very soon the prophecy<br />will be fulfilled and this war will end.
1177134 1179261 I hope you're right, captain.
1179428 1182139 I do not believe it to be<br />a matter of hope, councillor.
1182306 1184892 It is simply a matter of time.
1187061 1188521 My stop.
1188688 1190106 See you soon.
1190272 1191732 Hopefully not too soon.
1191899 1195069 Let's go, kid.<br />These two got things to do.
1204495 1206247 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1206414 1208833 I am if you're thinking<br />this elevator is too slow.
1208999 1212336 - How long do we charge the <i>Neb?</i><br />- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
1212503 1216716 Some people go their entire lives<br />without hearing news that good.
1241157 1245494 Neo, please, I have a son,<br />Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis.</i>
1245661 1249165 - Please, watch over him.<br />- I'll try.
1249331 1251417 WOMAN:<br />I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus.</i>
1252209 1253502 No, wait.
1253669 1256172 It's all right. They need you.
1256338 1258591 - I need you.<br />- I know.
1259133 1261427 There's time.
1266390 1268517 Where's my puss...?
1268684 1271020 - Hey!<br />- Uncle Link!
1271187 1272813 God!
1272980 1274940 CHILDREN:<br />Uncle Link!
1275107 1278694 Oh, my God! You're so huge!
1278861 1281030 - You should be picking me up!<br />- No!
1281197 1282740 -Yeah!<br />CHILDREN: Okay!
1282907 1284617 LINK:<br />Okay? All right.
1284784 1287828 Now, we're gonna have<br />to work together here, okay?
1287995 1290206 One, two, three, lift!
1290372 1293542 Oh, my God!<br />What are you feeding these two?
1293709 1296420 Come on, kids. It's time to go.
1298214 1299548 -Hey, Cas.<br />CAS: Hey.
1300090 1302635 - Good to have you home, Link.<br />- Good to be home.
1302802 1304637 You be careful with her.
1304804 1307598 Don't worry about me.<br />He's the one that's gonna get it.
1309433 1311811 CAS:<br />Out the door! Both of you, march!
1311977 1314021 LINK: Bye!<br />CAS: Bye!
1320402 1321946 I'm gonna get what?
1323239 1327326 Every ship up there's been home two, even<br />three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
1327493 1331330 Come on, Zee.<br />I thought we were past this.
1331497 1334917 - We'll be when you operate another ship.<br />- I can't do that.
1335084 1336585 - Why?<br />- You know why.
1336752 1339922 If Dozer knew how I felt,<br />he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
1340631 1343175 Maybe. But it's too late now.
1343342 1345970 I made a promise,<br />and some promises can't be unmade.
1346136 1348848 - It's not fair.<br />- Nobody said it was gonna be.
1349014 1351976 You think Cas thinks it's fair<br />that I'm here and Dozer's not?
1357898 1361110 I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
1362194 1364405 I'm afraid of it.
1365990 1368617 I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
1369285 1371120 It won't.
1371287 1373122 How can you say that to me?
1373289 1375249 Because of Morpheus.
1375416 1380045 Because of what he's told me. He said<br />that this is it, that it will be over soon.
1380212 1384425 - Link, Morpheus is crazy.<br />- No doubt.
1384925 1388137 But Tank and Dozer believed him.<br />And I'll tell you what...
1388304 1393642 ...after being on that ship and seeing Neo<br />do the things he can do, I gotta say...
1393809 1395853 ...I'm starting to believe him too.
1400983 1403402 Be careful, Link.
1408741 1411118 Please be careful.
1420210 1423631 - They started yet?<br />- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
1423797 1426884 Tonight, let us honor<br />these men and women.
1427051 1429678 These are our soldiers, our warriors.
1429845 1434099 These are our husbands and wives,<br />our brothers and sisters...
1434266 1435935 ...our children.
1436518 1439647 Let us remember those<br />that have been lost...
1439813 1443025 ...and let us give thanks<br />for those that have been found...
1443192 1446487 ...and who stand here beside us.
1446695 1450366 Now I would like someone else<br />to close this prayer...
1450532 1453744 ...someone who hasn't spoken here<br />in a long time...
1453911 1459291 ...but who I believe has something to say<br />that we all need to hear.
1460292 1461877 I give you Morpheus.
1481397 1485567 Zion! Hear me!
1486568 1489697 It is true what many of you have heard.
1489863 1493867 The machines have gathered<br />an army, and as I speak...
1494034 1497955 ...that army is drawing nearer to our home.
1498122 1499164 [CHATTERING]
1499415 1504086 Believe me when I say we have<br />a difficult time ahead of us.
1504753 1510926 But if we are to be prepared for it,<br />we must first shed our fear of it.
1511427 1516348 I stand here before you now<br />truthfully unafraid.
1516932 1518684 Why?

1529361 1533282 I remember that I am here not because<br />of the path that lies before me...
1533449 1536785 ...but because of the path<br />that lies behind me.
1536952 1541623 I remember that for 100 years<br />we have fought these machines.
1541790 1546545 I remember that for 100 years<br />they have sent their armies to destroy us.
1546712 1552801 And after a century of war,<br />I remember that which matters most:
1553677 1556680 We are still here!
1563395 1565481 Tonight...
1565647 1569026 ...let us send a message to that army.
1569193 1572237 Tonight, let us shake this cave.

1621036 1623455 I remember you used to dance.
1625082 1628377 I remember you were pretty good.

2135133 2139596 Almost no one comes down here.<br />Unless, of course, there's a problem.
2139763 2144851 That's how it is with people. Nobody cares<br />how it works as long as it works.
2145018 2147312 I like it down here.
2147479 2153276 I like to be reminded this city survives<br />because of these machines.
2153443 2158573 These machines are keeping us alive<br />while other machines are coming to kill us.
2158990 2163828 Interesting, isn't it?<br />The power to give life...
2163995 2167207 - ...and the power to end it.<br />- We have the same power.
2167374 2170085 Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
2170251 2173713 ...sometimes I think about those people<br />still plugged into the Matrix.
2173880 2176883 And when I look at these machines...
2177050 2182138 ...I can't help thinking that, in a way,<br />we are plugged into them.
2182430 2185308 But we control these machines,<br />they don't control us.
2185725 2188728 Of course not. How could they?
2188895 2191439 The idea is pure nonsense...
2191940 2195068 ...but it does make one wonder just...
2195235 2196820 ...what is control?
2197070 2200115 If we wanted, we could<br />shut these machines down.
2200490 2204953 Of course. That's it. You hit it.<br />That's control, isn't it?
2205578 2208957 If we wanted,<br />we could smash them to bits.
2209207 2213336 Although if we did, we'd have to consider<br />what would happen to our lights...
2213503 2216172 ...our heat, our air.
2217173 2221302 So we need machines and they need us.<br />Is that your point, councillor?
2221469 2224097 No. No point.
2224806 2228893 Old men like me don't bother<br />with making points. There's no point.
2229686 2233481 Is that why there are no young men<br />on the Council?
2233648 2235316 Good point.
2236025 2240196 Why don't you tell me<br />what's on your mind, councillor.
2240363 2243616 There is so much in this world...
2243783 2246703 ...that I do not understand.
2248496 2253251 See that machine? It has something to do<br />with recycling our water supply.
2253418 2256421 I have absolutely no idea how it works.
2256588 2260675 But I do understand the reason<br />for it to work.
2262177 2266681 I have absolutely no idea how you<br />are able to do some of the things you do.
2267849 2271019 But I believe there's a reason for that<br />as well.
2271895 2277025 I only hope we understand that reason<br />before it's too late.
2283531 2285200 - Ballard.<br />- Is he here?
2287619 2290205 Neo, it's from the Oracle.
2293166 2294876 It's time to go.
2295835 2298296 Morpheus said this was how<br />it was gonna happen.
2298463 2302884 I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,<br />maybe it's not.
2303426 2306596 All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
2308181 2310058 Right now, that operator's me.

2423296 2424589 Of course.
2425298 2429344 I believe I need every ship we have<br />if we're going to survive this attack.
2429928 2432096 I understand that, commander.
2432263 2434849 Then why did you allow<br />the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?
2435016 2439896 Because I believe our survival depends<br />on more than how many ships we have.

2497578 2499288 Apologize for what?
2499956 2501749 For this.
2559057 2561309 Good.
2563811 2566981 The Oracle has many enemies.<br />I had to be sure.
2567148 2569358 - Of what?<br />- That you are the One.
2569817 2573571 - You could have just asked.<br />- No. You do not truly know someone...
2573738 2575990 ...until you fight them.
2576532 2579994 Come. She's waiting.
2595051 2596928 Where the hell did they go?

2600181 2603101 Programmer access.
2604185 2607939 - How do they work?<br />- A code is hidden in tumblers.
2608106 2613111 One position opens a lock and another<br />position opens one of these doors.
2614862 2617698 Are you a programmer?
2617865 2620201 Then what are you?
2622370 2625873 I protect that which matters most.
2645393 2648771 ORACLE:<br />Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
2649188 2651983 Come around here<br />and let me have a look at you.
2655194 2657572 My goodness, look at you.
2657905 2660741 You turned out all right, didn't you?
2660908 2663119 - How do you feel?<br />- I...
2663286 2666873 I know you're not sleeping.<br />We'll get to that.
2667039 2669750 Why don't you come<br />and have a sit this time.
2670459 2674589 - Maybe I'll stand.<br />- Well, suit yourself.
2685725 2688269 - I felt like sitting.<br />- I know.
2689437 2691355 So...
2693441 2695860 ...let's get the obvious stuff<br />out of the way.
2696152 2700615 - You're not human, are you?<br />- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
2700781 2706621 If I had to guess, I'd say you're<br />a program from the machine world.
2706996 2711209 - So is he.<br />- So far, so good.
2711375 2714545 But if that's true, that could mean<br />you're part of this system...
2714712 2717298 ...another kind of control.
2717465 2721969 - Keep going.<br />- I suppose the most obvious question is...
2722136 2726057 - ...how can I trust you?<br />- Bingo.
2727099 2730353 It is a pickle, no doubt about it.<br />Bad news is...
2730519 2734190 ...there's no way you can really know<br />if I'm here to help you or not.
2734357 2737902 So it's really up to you. Just have<br />to make up your own damn mind...
2738069 2742865 ...to either accept what<br />I'm going to tell you or reject it.
2744158 2746327 Candy?
2749038 2753459 - Do you already know if I'll take it?<br />- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
2753626 2756837 But if you already know,<br />how can I make a choice?
2757004 2761050 Because you didn't come here to make<br />the choice. You've already made it.
2761217 2765846 You're here to try to understand<br />why you made it.

2776107 2778693 - Why are you here?<br />- Same reason.
2778943 2781696 I love candy.
2781862 2784699 But why help us?
2784865 2788369 We're all here to do<br />what we're all here to do.
2788911 2791998 I'm interested in one thing, Neo:<br />the future.
2792164 2796377 And believe me, I know, the only way<br />to get there is together.
2797211 2802133 - Are there other programs like you?<br />- Well, not like me, but...
2802300 2804969 Look. See those birds?
2805219 2808597 At some point, a program was written<br />to govern them.
2808764 2814603 A program was written to watch over the<br />trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
2814854 2817732 There are programs running<br />all over the place.
2817898 2822361 The ones doing their job, doing what<br />they were meant to do, are invisible.
2822528 2826365 You'd never even know they were here.<br />But the other ones...
2826532 2830619 Well, you hear about them all the time.
2831203 2834081 - I've never heard of them.<br />- Of course you have.
2834248 2839170 Every time you've heard someone<br />say they saw a ghost or an angel...
2839337 2843924 ...every story you've ever heard about<br />vampires, werewolves or aliens...
2844091 2846427 ...is the system assimilating<br />some program...
2846594 2851265 ...that's doing something<br />they're not supposed to be doing.
2851432 2854435 Programs hacking programs.
2854602 2857480 - Why?<br />- They have their reasons...
2857646 2861609 ...but usually a program chooses exile<br />when it faces deletion.
2862026 2865946 - And why would a program be deleted?<br />- Maybe it breaks down.
2866113 2870659 Maybe a better program is created<br />to replace it. Happens all the time.
2870826 2875790 And when it does, a program<br />can either choose to hide here...
2875956 2878626 ...or return to the source.
2880294 2883589 - The machine mainframe.<br />- Yes.
2883756 2886258 Where you must go.

2927091 2930094 You are looking at the world<br />without time.
2930261 2932680 Then why can't I see<br />what happens to her?
2932847 2936600 We can never see past the choices<br />we don't understand.
2936767 2939937 Are you saying I have to choose<br />whether Trinity lives or dies?
2940187 2943983 No, you've already made the choice.
2944150 2946694 Now you have to understand it.
2947319 2948696 No.
2948863 2952116 I can't do that. I won't.
2952825 2955202 - Well, you have to.<br />- Why?
2955786 2958873 Because you're the One.
2961041 2964044 What if I can't?
2964211 2966213 What happens if I fail?
2966797 2969800 Then Zion will fall.

2982313 2985649 ...if you reach the source, but to do that<br />you need the Keymaker.

2998412 3001290 - And he won't let him go willingly.<br />- What does he want?
3001457 3006295 What do all men with power want?<br />More power.
3007004 3010257 Be there at that exact time...
3010424 3013093 ...and you will have a chance.
3013886 3016138 We must go.

3127666 3131211 ...compelled to disobey.
3131795 3135549 And now, here I stand<br />because of you, Mr. Anderson.
3135716 3139678 Because of you, I'm no longer an agent<br />of this system.
3139845 3143057 Because of you, I've changed.<br />I'm unplugged.
3143223 3148062 A new man, so to speak.<br />Like you, apparently free.
3148395 3149772 Congratulations.
3150522 3152858 Thank you.
3153442 3158072 But as you well know,<br />appearances can be deceiving...
3158238 3163410 ...which brings me back to the reason<br />why we're here.
3163577 3168457 We're not here because we're free.<br />We're here because we are not free.
3168624 3172544 There's no escaping reason,<br />no denying purpose.
3172711 3176090 Because as we both know,<br />without purpose...
3176256 3181095 - ...we would not exist.<br />- It is purpose that created us.
3181261 3184264 -Purpose that connects us.<br />SMITH 4: Purpose that pulls us.
3184431 3186266 SMITH 5: That guides us.<br />SMITH 6: That drives us.
3186433 3191146 - It is purpose that defines.<br />- Purpose that binds us.
3191313 3193774 We are here because of you,<br />Mr. Anderson.
3193941 3198320 We're here to take from you<br />what you tried to take from us:
3200280 3202366 Purpose.
3205452 3207329 - What's happening to him?<br />- Don't know.
3210374 3213961 Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
3320818 3323278 - You.<br />- Yes, me.
3327449 3330327 Me, me, me.
3335207 3336875 Me too.
3449321 3451448 [SCREAMS]
3464628 3465671 More.
3527941 3530777 It is inevitable.
3531194 3532612 Come on, get out of there.
3575822 3578158 Are you all right?
3579242 3581161 - It was Smith.<br />- Yes.
3582037 3584664 MORPHEUS: Now there's more than one?<br />- A lot more.
3584831 3588627 - How is that possible?<br />- I don't know.
3588794 3591254 Somehow, he's found a way<br />to copy himself.
3591421 3595634 - Is that what he was doing to you?<br />- I don't know what he was doing...
3595801 3598553 - ...but I know what it felt like.<br />- What?
3599471 3603183 It felt like I was back in that hallway.
3603350 3604768 It felt like dying.
3605268 3608146 The machines are tunneling to avoid<br />our defense system.
3608313 3612150 But I believe they will intersect<br />certain pipelines to control them.
3612317 3614861 These points of intersection<br />are crucial...
3615028 3617823 ...because I believe they're<br />vulnerable to counterattack.
3617989 3622035 Although it has been suggested that<br />this is the same kind of attack...
3622202 3625872 ...we've defended for years,<br />I urge the Council to realize the truth.
3626039 3629376 This is the single greatest threat<br />we have ever faced...
3629543 3633380 ...and if we do not act accordingly,<br />we will not survive.
3633547 3637551 Commander Lock, the Council is well<br />aware of the seriousness of this attack.
3637843 3642389 You have our leave to prepare our defense<br />by any and all means necessary.
3642556 3645225 -Thank you, Council.<br />DILLARD: However...
3645475 3648812 ...we ask if there's been word<br />from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3649062 3651565 No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
3653191 3657154 Then we request a ship be dispatched<br />to ascertain the fate of the One.
3657320 3661074 I wish that were possible, councillor,<br />but I do not believe our defense...
3661241 3664786 - ...can suffer the loss of another ship.<br />- It will, commander, if it must.
3664953 3667289 It could take one ship days<br />to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3667455 3670500 - Then send two.<br />- This is insane.
3670667 3673670 Careful, commander.
3673879 3677215 Forgive my frustration, councillors.
3677382 3681261 But I wish I were able to comprehend<br />the Council's choice in this matter.
3681428 3684598 Comprehension is not<br />a requisite of cooperation.
3684764 3687225 If you are asking me<br />to order two of my captains...
3687392 3689102 There's no need for such an order.
3689269 3692814 The captains are present.<br />They can answer for themselves.
3693273 3698528 The Council is calling for two volunteers<br />to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
3698695 3702866 Are there two among you<br />that would answer such a call?
3704159 3707954 Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i><br />will answer the Council's call.
3708121 3711041 You understand the situation,<br />Captain Soren?
3711208 3713668 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Thank you, captain.
3715086 3716504 Is there another?
3717297 3721009 - Captain, I think we should volunteer.<br />- What? You have gone crazy.
3721176 3723053 - Listen...<br />- Shut your hole, Bane...
3723220 3724721 ...before I put you in one.
3734564 3736316 Is there no other?
3737067 3738985 Be hard for any man to risk his life...
3739152 3742113 ...especially if he doesn't<br />understand the reason.
3742572 3746076 Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i><br />will answer the councillor's call.
3746243 3748495 - What?<br />- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
3748703 3753792 Commander Lock, you have your orders.<br />This Council is hereby adjourned.
3758505 3761091 - Niobe, what are you doing?<br />- What I can.
3761258 3762300 Why?
3763593 3766846 Because some things<br />never change, Jason...
3767013 3769349 ...and some things do.
3785782 3787200 What can you see, Neo?
3787367 3789703 It's strange.<br />The code is somehow different.
3789869 3791454 - Encrypted?<br />- Maybe.
3791621 3793581 Is that good for us or bad for us?
3794291 3797419 Well, it looks like every floor<br />is wired with explosives.
3798044 3799587 Bad for us.
3800005 3801506 Here we go.
3807470 3808847 [SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
3809514 3812434 Yes. We are here to speak<br />with the Merovingian.
3812892 3816730 Well, of course.<br />He has been expecting you.
3816896 3817939 Follow me.
3838626 3842297 A-ha. Here he is at last.
3842505 3845800 Neo, the One himself.
3845967 3847385 Right?
3847552 3849888 And the legendary Morpheus.
3850722 3855602 And Trinity, of course.<br />I have heard so much.
3855769 3859230 You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.<br />This is my wife, Persephone.
3860148 3863443 Something to eat? Drink?
3863735 3866780 Of course, such things are contrivances,<br />like so much here.
3866946 3869449 For the sake of appearances.
3869616 3873078 - No, thank you.<br />- Yes, of course. Who has time?
3873244 3878333 Who has time? But then, if we do not ever<br />take time, how can we ever have time?
3882045 3885423 Château Haut-Briond, 1959.<br />Magnificent wine.
3885590 3888510 I love French wine<br />like I love the French language.
3888676 3892847 I have sampled every language.<br />French is my favorite. Fantastic language...
3893014 3895141 ...especially to curse with.
3895433 3897977 [SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
3899145 3903691 You see? It's like wiping your ass<br />with silk. I love it.
3905318 3907070 You know why we are here.
3908822 3913701 I am a trafficker of information.<br />I know everything I can.
3914119 3919958 The question is,<br />do you know why you are here?
3920250 3922710 We are looking for the Keymaker.
3923378 3927882 Oh, yes, it is true.<br />The Keymaker, of course.
3928049 3931010 But this is not a reason,<br />this is not a why.
3931177 3934931 The Keymaker himself, his very nature,<br />is a means, it is not an end.
3935098 3940854 And so to look for him is to be<br />looking for a means to do...
3941020 3944190 - ...what?<br />- You know the answer to that question.
3944357 3946484 But do you?
3946693 3949028 You think you do, but you do not.
3949195 3952407 You are here<br />because you were sent here.
3952574 3955702 You were told to come here,<br />and then you obeyed.
3956870 3959205 It is, of course, the way of all things.
3959372 3962041 You see, there is only one constant...
3962208 3966379 ...one universal. It is the only real truth.
3966546 3968214 Causality.
3968381 3970675 Action, reaction.
3970842 3975054 - Cause and effect.<br />- Everything begins with choice.
3975221 3976973 No. Wrong.
3977140 3981728 Choice is an illusion created<br />between those with power...
3981895 3983980 ...and those without.
3985523 3988693 Look there at that woman.
3989402 3993323 My God, just look at her...
3993573 3996242 ...affecting everyone around her.
3996409 4001164 So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.<br />But wait.
4001414 4005168 Watch. You see, I have sent her<br />a dessert...
4005376 4009589 ...a very special dessert.
4013927 4016387 I wrote it myself.
4016554 4019766 It starts so simply...
4019933 4024521 ...each line of the program creating<br />a new effect, just like...
4025563 4027190 ...poetry.
4027357 4028775 First...
4029275 4034697 ...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
4035281 4037909 You can see it, Neo, yes?
4038535 4041120 She does not understand why.
4041371 4043790 Is it the wine? No.
4043957 4046334 What is it then? What is the reason?
4046960 4049295 And soon it does not matter.
4049462 4052465 Soon the why and the reason are gone...
4053424 4058972 ...and all that matters is the feeling itself.
4059430 4062517 And this is the nature of the universe.
4062684 4065228 We struggle against it,<br />we fight to deny it...
4065395 4067981 ...but it is, of course, pretense.<br />It is a lie.
4068147 4072151 Beneath our poised appearance...
4072318 4077615 ...the truth is, we are completely...
4080493 4083371 ...out of control.
4088710 4093590 Causality. There is no escape from it.<br />We are forever slaves to it.
4094007 4099470 Our only hope, our only peace,<br />is to understand it, to understand the why.
4099637 4103057 "Why" is what separates us from them...
4103224 4105518 ...you from me.
4105685 4109439 "Why" is the only real source of power.<br />Without it, you are powerless.
4109606 4112900 And this is how you come to me,<br />without why, without power.
4113067 4115862 Another link in the chain.
4116070 4117363 But fear not.
4117530 4121409 Since I have seen how good you are<br />at following orders...
4121576 4124203 ...I will tell you what to do next.
4124704 4129542 Run back and give the fortuneteller<br />this message:
4129751 4134005 Her time is almost up.
4135048 4138593 Now I have some real business to do,<br />so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.
4138760 4141262 - This isn't over.<br />- Oh, yes, it is.
4141429 4147810 The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason<br />why I should give him up.
4147977 4152023 - No reason at all.<br />- Where are you going?
4152190 4156903 Please, <i>ma chérie,</i> I have told you.<br />We are all victims of causality.
4157070 4160406 I drank too much wine,<br />I must take a piss.
4160907 4164035 Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir.</i>
4169082 4172168 Touch me and that hand<br />will never touch anything again.
4181052 4182553 Well, that didn't go so well.
4182720 4185098 Are you certain the Oracle<br />didn't say anything else?
4185264 4187392 - Yes.<br />- Maybe we did something wrong.
4188059 4189394 Or didn't do something.
4189560 4192814 No, what happened couldn't have<br />happened any other way.
4192980 4195733 - How do you know?<br />- We are still alive.
4195900 4196943 [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
4199028 4202281 If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
4209288 4211374 Get out.
4213292 4219632 I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.<br />On and on. Pompous prick.
4220216 4225722 A long time ago, when we first came here,<br />it was so different.
4227473 4230184 He was so different.
4231978 4234605 He was like you.
4237316 4241112 I'll give you what you want,<br />but you have to give me something.
4241863 4244157 - What?<br />- A kiss.
4244532 4245658 Excuse me?
4247160 4251080 I want you to kiss me<br />as if you were kissing her.
4252999 4256586 - Why?<br />- You love her. She loves you.
4256836 4258796 It's all over you both.
4259464 4264010 A long time ago,<br />I knew what that felt like.
4265344 4271100 I want to remember it.<br />I want to sample it. That's all.
4271350 4273186 Just a sample.
4273352 4276355 - Why don't you sample this instead?<br />- Trinity.
4278566 4283529 Such emotion over something so small.<br />It's just a kiss.
4283696 4285865 Why should we trust you?
4286032 4290036 If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,<br />she can kill me.
4297126 4299253 All right.
4299545 4303382 But you have to make me believe<br />I am her.
4304592 4306636 All right.
4312975 4314811 Terrible. Forget it.
4317772 4319232 Wait.
4320149 4321692 Okay.
4358771 4360857 Yes.
4361440 4363943 That's it.
4378708 4384130 I envy you. But such a thing<br />is not meant to last.
4387133 4388509 Come with me.
4419582 4421334 Not again.
4424754 4427381 It's all right, boys. They're with me.
4428049 4430426 These fellas work for my husband.
4430593 4434430 They do his dirty work.<br />They're very good, very loyal.

4437516 4440227 They come from a much older version<br />of the Matrix.
4440394 4444565 But like so many back then, they caused<br />more problems than they solved.
4445316 4450321 My husband saved them because<br />they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

4981685 4984438 <i>- Won't be easy.</i><br />- I know. We're inside the core network.
4984605 4987232 <i>The only exit I got<br />near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>
4987399 4989485 - Off the freeway.<br /><i>- Yes, sir.</i>
4989651 4993405 - Fine, we'll make it.<br /><i>- I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>
4998410 4999995 - Incoming fire.<br />- Down!
5008253 5009421 Hold on!
5026438 5028941 Oh, no. This is getting real ugly<br />real fast.
5029107 5030817 Are you watching this, Link?
5030984 5034613 Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.<br />Eight units headed your way.
5035656 5037616 Any suggestions?
5039493 5041495 - Turn right.<br />- Right, now.
5048961 5051797 LINK: Straight here.<br />You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
5051964 5054675 MORPHEUS: <i>Got it.</i><br />- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
5054841 5058554 - In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...<br />- Link, what did I tell you?
5058845 5061139 Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
5061306 5063809 - I'll be ready for you.<br />- Good man.
5063976 5066144 You always told me<br />to stay off the freeway.
5066311 5068939 - Yes, that's true.<br />- You said it was suicide.
5069147 5071066 Then let us hope...
5071233 5072609 ...that I was wrong.
5083287 5084329 [PHONE RINGS]
5084496 5085581 - Operator.<br />- Link, it's Niobe.
5085747 5087374 We've been sent to bring you in.
5087541 5090627 - I need to talk to Morpheus.<br />- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
5090794 5092796 <i>- Where is he?</i><br />- Just follow the sirens.
5100345 5102264 Repeat, they're approaching the...

5176880 5178757 Move!
5288742 5291953 - We are getting aggravated.<br />- Yes, we are.
5337999 5340001 Trinity.
5340418 5341545 Get him out of here.
5345173 5347259 Come on!
5364276 5365777 Crush him.
5396266 5397309 Morpheus.
5397475 5398977 He's okay. Keep moving.
5399978 5401771 Let's go.
5407527 5409696 I need a download<br />to hot-wire a motorcycle.
5409863 5412198 No problem.<br />One crash course on motorcycle...
5412365 5413783 Wait.
5415160 5416620 Cancel that.
5416786 5418997 You are handy.
5419164 5421082 Jump on.
5568354 5569397 She means nothing.
5569564 5572692 - Find the exile.<br />- We have them.

5581618 5583328 Get down.
5714334 5715960 Gotcha.
5716711 5717795 She's good.
5722175 5724469 You are no longer necessary.
5731142 5734854 We do only what we're meant to do.
5736481 5740068 Then you are meant for one more thing:<br />deletion.
5741027 5742904 Go kick his ass.
5792954 5795707 Neo, if you're out there,<br />I could use some help.
5796457 5797917 What is that?
5827780 5830658 Yes! Yes!
5837248 5842378 We have confirmation from the <i>Icarus.</i> First<br />two ships are in position for counterattack.
5842628 5843671 Good.
5844672 5845715 Any change?
5845882 5848634 They hit some iron ore here.<br />Slowed them down a little.
5848801 5851929 - How much?<br />- An hour, maybe.
5852096 5854640 That would give them<br />a little over nine hours.
5855475 5857101 Yes, sir.
5889717 5891969 KEYMAKER:<br /><i>There is a building.</i>
5892136 5897809 Inside this building, there is a level<br />where no elevator can go...
5897975 5899894 ...and no stair can reach.
5900561 5906651 <i>This level is filled with doors.<br />These doors lead to many places.</i>
5906818 5909153 Hidden places.
5909487 5913116 But one door is special.
5913282 5915493 One door leads to the source.
5923835 5928256 This building is protected<br />by a very secure system.
5928423 5932927 - Every alarm triggers the bomb.<br />- Bomb? Did he say bomb?
5933177 5935847 KEYMAKER: But like all systems,<br />it has a weakness.
5936013 5939016 The system is based on the rules<br />of a building.
5939183 5942562 - One system built on another.<br />- Electricity.
5943104 5947859 - If one fails, so must the other.<br />- No electricity, no alarms.
5948025 5950862 You'd have to take out a city block<br />to kill the power.
5951028 5954740 - Not one, 27.<br />- Twenty-seven blocks?
5955575 5958035 KEYMAKER:<br /><i>There is a power station.</i>
5958202 5960455 <i>It must be destroyed.</i>
5960621 5964959 - There must be some kind of fail-safe.<br />- Yes, there is an emergency system.
5966586 5970381 <i>The core network of the grid<br />must be accessed.</i>
5970548 5973384 <i>The emergency system<br />must be deactivated.</i>
5973551 5974969 SOREN:<br /><i>What do you need us for?</i>
5975136 5977305 Neo could take them out<br />easier than we could.
5977472 5979223 - There's no time.<br />- Why?
5979390 5982518 Once the door is unprotected,<br />the connection will be severed.
5982685 5984979 But another connection<br />must first be made.
5985813 5989650 SOREN: <i>How long will that take?</i><br />KEYMAKER: <i>Exactly 314 seconds.</i>
5989817 5991402 MAN:<br /><i>Just over five minutes.</i>
5991569 5993821 KEYMAKER: <i>That is the length<br />and breadth of the window.</i>
5993988 5996282 Only the One can open the door...
5996491 5999410 ...and only during that window<br />can the door be opened.
6000661 6002246 How do you know all this?
6002413 6007585 I know because I must know.<br />It is my purpose.
6007752 6013257 It's the reason I'm here,<br />the same reason we're all here.
6024018 6026812 Neo, I know something's wrong.
6027480 6029524 You don't have to tell me.
6029690 6033444 I just want you to know that I'm here.
6036989 6038449 All must be done as one.
6043204 6044872 Can't hurt.
6048417 6050503 If one fails...
6051295 6053005 <i>...all fail.</i>
6053506 6057176 At midnight, there is a shift change<br />in the security of both buildings.

6058553 6061806 MORPHEUS:<br /><i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>
6062431 6063516 GUARD:<br />Hey!
6063683 6067645 - You count sheep at home.<br />- Why? I get paid to count them here.
6077822 6080032 Okay, they're inside.
6080199 6082702 - How much time?<br />- Twelve minutes.
6082868 6084996 [BEEPING]
6085413 6086497 Oh, shit.
6089875 6095339 All of our lives, we have fought this war.<br />Tonight, I believe we can end it.
6096841 6099010 <i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>
6100344 6102346 <i>There are no accidents.</i>
6103723 6108769 We have not come here by chance.<br />I do not believe in chance.
6108936 6114525 When I see three objectives,<br />three captains, three ships...
6114692 6118195 ...I do not see coincidence.<br />I see providence.
6118529 6120865 <i>I see purpose.</i>
6123576 6129915 I believe it is our fate to be here.<br />It is our destiny.
6130082 6135087 I believe this night holds<br />for each and every one of us...
6135254 6138591 ...the very meaning of our lives.
6138758 6142928 I want to ask you to do something,<br />but I don't know how.
6143512 6145431 I promise you, if I can, I will.
6146766 6150102 What if I asked you to stay out of this...
6151062 6153064 ...no matter what...
6153230 6155566 ...to stay out of the Matrix?
6156651 6158444 Why?
6166661 6167745 Please.
6169830 6171165 All right.
6174502 6177004 What is it, Niobe?
6177171 6181300 I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't<br />help thinking, what if you're wrong?
6181467 6184762 What if all this, the prophecy,<br />everything, is bullshit?
6184929 6188933 Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
6189350 6191977 But how would that be different<br />from any other day?
6201445 6207952 This is a war, and we are soldiers.
6208202 6211122 <i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>
6211664 6213457 <i>...in any place.</i>
6213624 6215543 Incoming. Incoming!
6217503 6219130 Incoming!
6225052 6227513 Now consider the alternative.
6227680 6232268 What if I am right?<br />What if the prophecy is true?
6232435 6236856 What if tomorrow the war could be over?
6237815 6240818 Isn't that worth fighting for?
6241944 6244572 Isn't that worth dying for?
6245489 6248117 - Time?<br />- Three minutes.
6248284 6249410 Almost there.
6249785 6252037 [BEEPING]
6264216 6266010 [RUMBLING]
6269472 6270848 It is done.
6271015 6272308 Find the others.
6273434 6275686 I got Niobe there.<br />They're out of the station.
6275853 6278522 - What about Soren?<br />- There.
6278689 6280524 They're still inside, but...
6281400 6282443 They're not moving.
6306592 6308511 That's it, let's go.
6310638 6312473 Call Neo now.
6316435 6319271 - I lost them. They're inside the portal.<br />- What about the grid?
6323400 6326904 Everything is operational.<br />The emergency system is rerouting power.
6332576 6334745 Jesus.
6334912 6338958 Soon as they open that door,<br />it's all over.
6339124 6341085 The hell it is.

6344463 6347424 I will not wait and do nothing.<br />I will not watch them die.

6349927 6352429 In five minutes,<br />I'll tear that building down.
6352596 6356141 - How much further?<br />- Here, just here.
6357434 6361438 I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
6362606 6365109 It's gotta be the ugliest hack<br />I have ever done.

6398350 6403731 Well, that's the difference between us.<br />I have been expecting you.
6403898 6406817 -What do you want, Smith?<br />SMITH: You haven't figured that out?
6406984 6412489 Still using all the muscles<br />except the one that matters.
6412656 6415326 I want exactly what you want.
6415492 6417578 I want everything.
6418037 6420539 Would that include a bullet<br />from this gun?
6420706 6422499 Go ahead, shoot.

6475886 6479014 Still no sight of them.<br />They only got two minutes left.
6492778 6493821 One minute.
6503038 6504081 Come on.
6505249 6507167 Come on.
6507751 6509628 Please.
6519555 6521098 Kill them.

6530190 6532151 <i>I don't believe it.</i>
6547708 6549835 It was meant to be.
6550002 6555382 Morpheus, that door will take you home.
6564141 6568479 You will know which door.<br />Hurry, Neo.
6573984 6577154 Trinity, I got some serious activity<br />headed your way.
6629456 6630833 Hello, Neo.
6631375 6635170 - Who are you?<br />- I am the Architect.
6635337 6638966 I created the Matrix.<br />I've been waiting for you.
6639216 6643387 You have many questions. Though the<br />process has altered your consciousness...
6643554 6645556 ...you remain irrevocably human.
6645722 6649309 Ergo, some of my answers you will<br />understand and some you will not.
6649726 6653772 Concordantly, while your first question<br />may be the most pertinent...
6653939 6657651 ...you may or may not realize<br />it is also the most irrelevant.
6658527 6660154 Why am I here?
6660320 6664241 Your life is the sum of a remainder<br />of an unbalanced equation...
6664408 6666743 ...inherent to the programming<br />of the Matrix.
6666910 6670998 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,<br />which despite my sincerest efforts...
6671165 6674001 ...I've been unable to eliminate<br />from what is otherwise...
6674168 6678630 ...a harmony of mathematical precision.
6678964 6681300 While it remains a burden<br />assiduously avoided...
6681466 6685929 ...it is not unexpected and thus<br />not beyond a measure of control...
6686096 6690058 ...which has led you, inexorably...
6691018 6692269 ...here.
6692436 6696523 - You haven't answered my question.<br />- Quite right.
6696690 6700485 Interesting.<br />That was quicker than the others.
6700652 6703280 NEOS: <i>Others? How many?<br />What others?</i>
6703447 6705949 The Matrix is older than you know.
6706116 6710120 I count from the emergence of one integral<br />anomaly to the emergence of the next.
6710287 6712539 In which case, this is the sixth version.
6712706 6715167 NEOS: <i>Five before me?<br />He's lying. Bullshit.</i>
6715334 6718879 <i>There are only two possible explanations.<br />There were five before me.</i>
6719046 6720339 <i>Either no one told me...</i>
6721590 6725594 - ...or no one knows.<br />- Precisely.
6725761 6729056 As you are undoubtedly gathering,<br />the anomaly is systemic...
6729223 6732643 ...creating fluctuations in even<br />the most simplistic equations.
6732809 6736063 <i>You can't control me!<br />I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>
6736230 6738023 <i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>
6738190 6741360 <i>You can't make me do anything.<br />You old, white prick!</i>
6743654 6745155 Choice.
6745322 6747157 The problem is choice.
6747699 6748742 [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
6769388 6773016 The first Matrix I designed<br />was naturally perfect, a work of art.
6773183 6775018 Flawless, sublime.
6775185 6778689 A triumph equaled only<br />by its monumental failure.
6779356 6781775 The inevitability of its doom<br />is apparent now...
6781942 6785279 ...as a consequence of the imperfection<br />inherent in every human.
6785445 6788407 Thus, I redesigned it<br />based on your history...
6788573 6792577 ...to more accurately reflect<br />the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
6793287 6797040 However, I was again frustrated<br />by failure.
6798500 6801128 I have come to understand<br />that the answer eluded me...
6801295 6803338 ...because it required a lesser mind.
6803505 6809469 Or perhaps, a mind less bound<br />by the parameters of perfection.
6809886 6814308 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon<br />by another, an intuitive program...
6814474 6819271 ...initially created to investigate<br />certain aspects of the human psyche.
6819438 6825402 If I am the father of the Matrix,<br />she would undoubtedly be its mother.
6826028 6828322 - The Oracle.<br />- Please.
6829031 6833035 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br />solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
6833201 6836079 ...accepted the program, as long as they<br />were given a choice...
6836246 6840375 ...even if they were only aware<br />of the choice at a near unconscious level.
6840542 6843962 While this answer functioned,<br />it was fundamentally flawed...
6844129 6848133 ...thus creating the otherwise<br />contradictory systemic anomaly...
6848300 6851011 ...that, if left unchecked,<br />might threaten the system.
6851386 6855515 Ergo, those that refused the program,<br />while a minority, if unchecked...
6855682 6859770 ...would constitute<br />an escalating probability of disaster.
6859936 6861730 This is about Zion.
6862189 6865859 You are here because Zion<br />is about to be destroyed.
6866026 6870447 Its every living inhabitant terminated,<br />its entire existence eradicated.
6870739 6871782 Bullshit.
6871948 6875118 Denial is the most predictable<br />of all human responses.
6875327 6881792 But rest assured, this will be<br />the sixth time we have destroyed it...
6881958 6885962 ...and we have become<br />exceedingly efficient at it.
6898683 6899976 The function of the One...
6900143 6904815 ...is now to return to the source, allowing<br />a dissemination of the code you carry...
6904981 6906691 ...reinserting the prime program.
6907275 6911279 After which you will be required to select<br />from the Matrix 23 individuals...
6911446 6914699 ...sixteen female, seven male,<br />to rebuild Zion.
6914866 6919413 Failure to comply with this process<br />will result in a cataclysmic system crash...
6919579 6921915 ...killing everyone connected<br />to the Matrix...
6922082 6924668 ...which, coupled with the<br />extermination of Zion...
6924835 6929047 ...will result in the extinction<br />of the entire human race.
6929381 6933468 You won't let it happen. You can't.<br />You need human beings to survive.
6934261 6937889 There are levels of survival<br />we are prepared to accept.
6938056 6940851 The relevant issue is<br />whether or not you are ready...
6941017 6944604 ...to accept the responsibility for the death<br />of every human being in this world.
6951069 6953613 It is interesting reading your reactions.
6954656 6958493 Your five predecessors were, by design,<br />based on a similar predication...
6958660 6963123 ...a contingent affirmation that was meant<br />to create a profound attachment...
6963290 6966877 ...to the rest of your species,<br />facilitating the function of the One.
6967043 6969379 While the others experience this<br />in a general way...
6969546 6972507 ...your experience is far more specific...
6972841 6975719 ...vis-à-vis love.
6976720 6978346 Trinity!
6980640 6984978 Apropos, she entered the Matrix<br />to save your life at the cost of her own.
6985353 6986396 No.
6987105 6991234 Which brings us at last to the moment<br />of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
6991401 6994488 ...is ultimately expressed<br />and the anomaly revealed...
6994654 6998658 ...as both beginning and end.
6998825 7000494 There are two doors.
7000660 7003872 The door to your right leads to the source<br />and the salvation of Zion.
7004456 7010754 The door to your left leads back to the<br />Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
7010921 7015300 As you adequately put,<br />the problem is choice.
7015467 7018970 But we already know what<br />you are going to do, don't we?
7019137 7023225 Already I can see the chain reaction,<br />the chemical precursors that signal...
7023391 7028647 ...the onset of an emotion designed<br />specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
7028813 7033443 An emotion that is already blinding you<br />from the simple and obvious truth:
7033610 7040116 She is going to die and there is nothing<br />you can do to stop it.
7045121 7049251 Hope. It is the quintessential<br />human delusion, simultaneously...
7049417 7053129 ...the source of your greatest strength<br />and your greatest weakness.
7053296 7057634 If I were you, I would hope<br />that we don't meet again.
7057801 7059219 We won't.
7066643 7068853 We got a serious situation, sir.
7069312 7070397 MORPHEUS:<br />Oh, no.
7106641 7109269 [RUMBLING]
7130040 7133585 MORPHEUS: What was that?<br />- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.
7184219 7186012 Holy shit, he caught her.
7191685 7194145 [TRINITY WHIMPERING]
7199943 7201778 Neo, I had to.
7201945 7203697 I know.
7208743 7211287 The bullet is still inside.
7218086 7219254 [YELLS]
7222048 7223967 Trinity...
7225176 7226886 ...don't you quit on me now.
7236062 7238648 I'm sorry.
7245155 7247449 NEO:<br />Trinity.
7257417 7259377 Trinity...
7259544 7261337 ...I know you can hear me.
7262130 7264674 I'm not letting go.
7264841 7266468 I can't.
7267677 7269888 I love you too damn much.
7298583 7299876 I can't take this.
7303630 7306716 I guess this makes us even.
7319395 7321356 I don't understand it.
7321523 7324526 Everything was done<br />as it was supposed to be done.
7324692 7327737 Once the One reaches the source,<br />the war should be over.
7327904 7330740 - In 24 hours, it will be.<br />- What?
7330907 7335245 If we don't do something in 24 hours,<br />Zion will be destroyed.
7335662 7337288 - What?<br />- How do you know that?
7337747 7339791 - I was told it would happen.<br />- By whom?
7340792 7343628 It doesn't matter. I believed him.
7343795 7347632 - That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...<br />- It was a lie, Morpheus.
7349384 7351928 The prophecy was a lie.
7353137 7356140 The One was never meant<br />to end anything.
7356307 7359352 It was all another system of control.
7359519 7362605 I don't believe that.
7362939 7365275 But you said it yourself.
7365441 7369445 How can the prophecy be true<br />if the war isn't over?
7375618 7378079 I'm sorry.
7378246 7381624 I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
7381791 7384961 ...I swear to you it's the truth.
7388172 7390884 - What are we gonna do?<br />- I don't know.
7391092 7392927 [ALARM WAILS]
7393094 7394304 Oh, no!
7403646 7406983 - What are they doing?<br />- They're just out of EMP range.
7407483 7408735 It's a bomb.
7409903 7412113 We have to get out of here. Now.
7448816 7450693 I have dreamed a dream...
7453738 7457116 ...but now that dream<br />has gone from me.
7468169 7470421 Here they come.
7470672 7472382 Let's go, Morpheus.
7473800 7476844 - We won't make it.<br />- We have to try.
7484560 7487563 - Come on!<br />- Something's different.
7487730 7489732 What?
7490400 7491901 I can feel them.
7514841 7516426 Neo!
7522598 7526185 - What happened?<br />- I don't know.
7528062 7530523 [RUMBLING]
7531441 7533359 It's the <i>Hammer.</i>
7545038 7547749 WOMAN:<br />He's in some kind of coma...
7547915 7550168 ...but his vitals are stable.
7551377 7553296 What about you?
7553463 7555590 I'm fine.
7555757 7558134 You could use some rest.
7558301 7560136 No, I'm gonna stay with him.
7567226 7569854 Lock was right.<br />He guessed that the machines...
7570021 7572899 ...would cut off the mainlines<br />in and out of Zion.
7573066 7575818 He thought a counterattack<br />might surprise them.
7576069 7579489 It sounded good.<br />I figured we had a shot...
7579822 7582366 ...until someone screwed it up.
7582533 7585161 An EMP was triggered before<br />we got in position.
7585328 7587205 Five ships were instantly downed.
7587371 7589165 MAN:<br />When the machines broke through...
7589332 7592543 ...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
7592710 7595546 Was it an accident?<br />Some sort of malfunction?
7595713 7598174 - No one knows.<br />- Someone does.
7598341 7600093 Who?
7600259 7603971 Once the machines were done with us,<br />they started digging again.
7604138 7606432 We made a quick pass<br />to look for survivors.
7606641 7607725 You found one?
7609477 7611187 Only one.
8204279 8207574 WOMAN:<br /><i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>
8207741 8209451 <i>...has an end.</i>
8211870 8214748 <i>I see the end coming.</i>
8214915 8218711 <i>I see the darkness spreading.<br />I see death.</i>
8220838 8223841 Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
8224007 8226009 We missed you.
8226176 8228011 It ends tonight.
8232683 8234309 [THUNDER ROLLING]
8235227 8238355 WOMAN:<br /><i>You are all that stands in his way.</i>
8239940 8244486 <i>If you cannot stop him tonight,<br />then I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
