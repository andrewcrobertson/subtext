89337 91171 See you tomorrow.
93260 95718 (MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARS)
110483 111525 Oh, my God!
134173 135674 I'm in.
248788 250580 We're almost there.
250748 254709 - Sir, are you sure about this?<br />- I told you, we're going to be all right.
254877 260340 I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping<br />some serious sentinel activity up here.
298504 300922 - Link.<br />- Yes, sir?
301090 304217 Given your situation, I can't say<br />I understand your reasons...
304385 307053 ...for volunteering to operate<br />onboard my ship.
307221 311224 However, if you wish to continue to<br />do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
311767 313226 What's that, sir?
313978 315270 To trust me.
315438 317397 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
319442 322610 - I mean, I do, sir.<br />- I hope so.
322778 326156 Re-patch the main AC to the hard drives<br />and stand by to broadcast.
326324 327407 Yes, sir.
327619 329451 (DOOR OPENS)
336250 338501 Still can't sleep?
340463 341838 You wanna talk?
344175 346551 They're just dreams.
348888 351264 If you're afraid of something...
351432 353266 I just wish...
353934 356186 I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
356354 358188 That's all.
359106 360690 I just wish I knew.
360858 365111 She's gonna call. Don't worry.
365279 366321 Here you are.
366489 369949 - Are we ready to go?<br />- We're already late.
370117 374746 These geotherms confirm<br />the last transmission of the Osiris.
375498 377165 The machines are digging.
378834 381127 They're boring from the surface<br />straight down to Zion.
381295 383880 - Mother...<br />- They'll avoid the entire perimeter defense.
384048 385548 How fast are they moving?
385716 389094 Control estimates their descent<br />at 100 meters an hour. Shit
389261 391721 - MAN 1: How deep are they?<br />- Almost 2,000 meters.
391889 395433 - What about the scans from the Osiris?<br />- They can't be accurate.
395601 397519 - They may be.<br />- It's not possible. What
397686 400146 That'd mean there are<br />a quarter-million sentinels out there.
400314 401815 - That's right.<br />- MAN 2: That can't be.
401982 403650 MORPHEUS: Why not?
403818 407570 A sentinel for every man,<br />woman and child in Zion.
408531 412492 That sounds exactly like<br />the thinking of a machine to me.
412660 414828 Morpheus, glad you could join us.
415329 416496 Niobe.
417873 421251 My apologies to all.<br />But as you are undoubtedly aware...
421419 424712 ...it's become increasely difficult<br />to locate a secure broadcast position.
424880 428133 - Squiddies got our best spots.<br />- Main lines are crawling with them.
428300 432095 And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours<br />there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
432263 433388 What are we gonna do about it?
433556 435849 We're gonna do what<br />Commander Lock ordered us to do.
436183 438768 We'll evacuate broadcast level<br />and return to Zion.
438936 444065 And does the commander have a plan<br />for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
444233 446901 A strategy is still being formulated.
447069 448736 I'm sure it is.
463752 465753 MAN: What do you think<br />we should do, Morpheus?
465963 468089 - MORPHEUS: Proceed as ordered...<br />- What is it?
468257 469299 I don't know.
469467 472260 MORPHEUS: ...however, I must<br />ask one of you for help.
472428 478141 Some of you believe as I believe, some<br />of you do not. But those of you that do...
478309 480852 ...know we are nearing<br />the end of our struggle.
481020 485273 The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.<br />But before it can be...
485441 488776 ...the Oracle must be consulted.
496702 498953 If we return and recharge now...
499121 502874 ...we can be back inside within 36 hours,<br />well before the machines reach this depth.
503083 504918 Do you understand what you're asking?
505085 507921 I am asking that one ship<br />remain here in our place...
508088 510798 ...just in case the Oracle<br />should attempt to contact us.
510966 514093 Bullshit. You're asking for one of us<br />to disobey a direct order.
514261 518806 That's right, I am. But we well know<br />that the reason most of us are here...
518974 521601 ...is because of our affinity<br />for disobedience.
521769 523686 What happens when you<br />get back to Zion...
523854 526272 ...and the commander<br />throws you in the stockade?
526440 527649 He won't.
528776 531986 Goddamn it, Morpheus,<br />you ain't never gonna change.
532696 535448 Shit, I'll do it just to see<br />what Deadbolt does to you.
535616 537158 You got 36 hours.
539954 541788 SMITH: I'm looking for Neo.
541956 545333 - Never heard of him.<br />- I have something for him.
546544 548753 A gift.
548963 551839 You see, he set me free.
554134 556511 Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
557054 558096 Who was that?
558264 560098 MAN: How did you know someone was here?
560266 561724 He gave you this.
567481 568898 He said you set him free.
570859 573194 Is everything all right, sir?
573821 576197 The meeting is over.<br />Retreat to your exits.
576365 578575 - Agents are coming.<br />- Agents?
579034 580410 Go.
580580 582367 (POUNDING)
590212 591296 Hiya, fellas.
591463 592589 - AGENT 1: It's him.<br />- The anomaly.
592756 594007 - Do we proceed?<br />- Yes.
594174 596676 - He is still...<br />- Only human.
602850 605101 Hm. Upgrades.
660032 662575 - That went as expected.<br />- SMITH 2: Yes.
662743 665411 It's happening exactly as before.
665579 668247 Well, not exactly.
671960 674087 - What happened back there?<br />- LINK: I can't figure it out.
674254 675922 Agents just came out of nowhere.
676090 679092 And then the code got all weird.<br />Encryption I've never seen.
679259 682178 - Is Neo okay?<br />- Okay? Shit, I guess you should've seen him.
682346 683763 Where is he now?
685224 686974 He's doing his Superman thing.
736942 738401 Where are you?
743073 746659 This is the Nebuchadnezzar on approach,<br />requesting access through Gate Three.
750706 755168 Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.<br />Maintain present velocity and stand by.
755335 756836 LINK: Roger that, Control.
757004 760506 This is Zion Control requesting immediate<br />stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
761300 764510 We have the Nebuchadnezzar<br />on approach. Let's open her up.
770100 773019 Nebuchadnezzar you are cleared through<br />Gate Three to Bay Seven.
773187 774896 Roger that, Control.
782029 785114 Door's open, bed's made.<br />Welcome home.
785866 788034 No place like it.
802216 805927 Roger that, Control. Zion Control,<br />stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
855435 857854 CONTROL: The Nebuchadnezzar is down.<br />Bay Seven.
858021 859188 Understood.
869157 870449 Captain Mifune.
871535 872702 Captain Morpheus.
872870 875705 Are you here to escort me<br />to the stockade, captain?
875873 878249 - I'm just here to keep the peace.<br />- Commander Lock demands...
878419 880035 (MIFUNE CLEARS THROAT)
880544 883713 Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
884631 886465 - Link.<br />- Sir?
886633 889218 I want the ship ready to go<br />as soon as possible.
889386 890928 Understood, sir.
898103 900521 - What is it between them?<br />- Morpheus and Lock?
901648 903816 - Niobe.<br />- Captain Niobe?
903984 907194 She used to be with Morpheus.<br />Now she's with Lock.
908447 910031 What happened?
910240 913659 Morpheus went to the Oracle.<br />After that, everything changed.
913827 916495 Yeah, she can do that.
916663 917830 BOY: Neo!
918832 921709 - NEO: Oh, no.<br />- How does he always know?
921877 923836 Doesn't he have anything better to do?
924004 926714 You know what they say<br />about the life you save.
926882 928674 I didn't save his life.
930844 932219 Hiya, Neo.
933388 936015 - Trinity, Link.<br />- LINK: Hey.
936183 939852 - It's great to have you back.<br />- Thanks. It's good to be back.
940020 942772 - Can I carry that for you Neo?<br />- No, I can carry my own bag.
942940 944607 - Trinity?<br />- I'm fine.
945567 948444 - You can carry these.<br />- Yeah, sure, Link.
953367 957870 Hey, you know, next year<br />I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
958038 960790 I've been thinking a lot about it,<br />and I've made my decision.
960958 962416 Let me guess.
962918 964877 I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
965879 969423 I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other<br />crew positions, except for you, Link.
969591 970967 I'm sure he has reasons...
971134 974470 ...but the more I think about it,<br />the more I think it's meant to be.
974638 976180 You know, it's fate.
976348 977890 You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
978058 980601 I told you kid, you found me.<br />I didn't find you.
980769 983312 I know, but you got me out.<br />You saved me.
984439 986065 You saved yourself.
1002374 1005668 - Morpheus.<br />- MORPHEUS: Commander Lock.
1005919 1010423 I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to<br />offer you a chance to explain your actions.
1010590 1013467 I wasn't aware that my actions<br />required any explanation.
1013635 1015928 You were given a direct order<br />to return to Zion.
1016096 1018931 - I did.<br />- But you asked for one ship to remain behind.
1019099 1021767 I would have stayed,<br />but I needed to recharge my ship.
1021935 1024645 So you admit to a direct contravention<br />of your duty.
1024813 1028232 Commander we need a presence inside the<br />Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.
1028400 1030359 I don't want to hear that shit!
1030527 1033195 I don't care about oracles<br />or prophecies or messiahs!
1033363 1036782 I care about one thing: Stopping that<br />army from destroying this city.
1036950 1039785 And to do that I need soldiers<br />to obey my orders.
1039953 1044540 With all due respect, commander,<br />there is only one way to save our city.
1044708 1046125 How?
1046293 1049086 - Neo.<br />- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
1049254 1051881 Not everyone believes what you believe.
1052049 1054133 My beliefs do not require them to.
1062309 1066228 There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's<br />talking. A lot of people are scared.
1066396 1069148 No one remembers the last time<br />so many ships were docked.
1069316 1072276 - Something is happening, isn't it?<br />- Something big. Hey.
1072444 1075613 We're not allowed to say anything,<br />so stop asking.
1080911 1084038 Goddamn, it's good to be home.
1097052 1100012 I'll recommended to the council that you<br />be removed from duty.
1100180 1102515 That is, of course,<br />your prerogative, commander.
1102682 1106560 If it were up to me Captain, you wouldn't set<br />foot on a ship for the rest of your life.
1106728 1109480 Then I am grateful that<br />it is not up to you.
1109650 1111107 (DOOR OPENS)
1115946 1118364 - Councillor Hamann.<br />- Commander.
1119032 1121742 - Captain.<br />- Councillor.
1121910 1125287 Council's asked me to speak tonight<br />at the temple gathering.
1125455 1129542 The presence of the fleet and the<br />persistence of rumors must be addressed.
1129709 1132211 The people must be told<br />what is happening.
1132379 1134088 Of course, councillor.
1134798 1140052 But might I advise a level of discretion<br />concerning specific details.
1140220 1143222 - We do not wish to start a panic.<br />- Quite right.
1143390 1146475 A panic is not what anyone wants.
1146643 1149979 What about you, captain?<br />What would you advise?
1152399 1157153 The truth. No one will panic,<br />because there is nothing to fear.
1157320 1159446 That army won't never reach<br />the gates of Zion.
1160240 1163826 - What makes you so sure?<br />- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
1163994 1165870 Consider that in the past six months...
1166037 1168080 ...we have freed more minds<br />than in six years.
1168248 1171250 This attack is an act of desperation.
1171418 1175254 I believe very soon the prophecy<br />will be fulfilled and this war will end.
1177132 1179258 I hope you're right, captain.
1179426 1182136 I do not believe it to be<br />a matter of hope, councillor.
1182304 1184889 It is simply a matter of time.
1187058 1188517 My stop.
1188685 1190102 See you soon.
1190270 1191729 Hopefully not too soon.
1191897 1195065 Let's go, kid.<br />These two got things to do.
1204492 1206243 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1206411 1208829 I am if you're thinking<br />this elevator is too damn slow.
1208997 1212333 - How long do we charge the Neb?<br />- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
1212500 1216712 Some people go their entire lives<br />without hearing news that good.
1241154 1245491 Neo, please, I have a son,<br />Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
1245659 1249161 - Please, watch over him.<br />- I'll try.
1249329 1251413 WOMAN: I have a daughter on the Icarus.
1252207 1253499 No, wait.
1253667 1256168 It's all right. They need you.
1256336 1258587 - I need you.<br />- I know.
1259130 1261423 There's time.
1266388 1268514 Where's my puss...?
1268682 1271016 - Hey!<br />- Uncle Link!
1271184 1272810 God!
1272978 1274937 CHILDREN: Uncle Link!
1275105 1278691 Oh, my God! You're so huge!
1278858 1281026 - You should be picking me up!<br />- No!
1281194 1282736 - Yeah!<br />- CHILDREN: Okay!
1282904 1284613 LINK: Okay? All right.
1284781 1287825 Now, we're gonna have<br />to work together here, okay?
1287993 1290202 One, two, three, lift!
1290370 1293539 Oh, my God!<br />What are you feeding these two?
1293707 1296417 Come on, kids. It's time to go.
1298211 1299545 - Hey, Cas.<br />- CAS: Hey.
1300088 1302631 - Good to have you home, Link.<br />- Good to be home.
1302799 1304633 You be careful with her.
1304801 1307594 Don't worry about me.<br />He's the one that's gonna get it.
1309431 1311807 CAS: Out the door! Both of you, march!
1311975 1314018 - LINK: Bye!<br />- CAS: Bye!
1320400 1321942 I'm gonna get what?
1323236 1327323 Every ship up there's been home two, even<br />three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
1327490 1331327 Come on, Zee.<br />I thought we were past this.
1331494 1334913 - We'll get past this when you stop operating another ship.<br />- I can't do that.
1335081 1336582 - Why?<br />- You know why.
1336750 1339918 If Dozer knew how I felt,<br />he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
1340628 1343172 Maybe. But it's too late now.
1343340 1345966 I made a promise,<br />and some promises can't be unmade.
1346134 1348844 - It's not fair.<br />- Nobody said it was gonna be.
1349012 1351972 You think Cas thinks it's fair<br />that I'm here and Dozer's not?
1357896 1361106 I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
1362192 1364401 I'm afraid of it.
1365987 1368614 I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
1369282 1371116 It won't.
1371284 1373118 How can you say that to me?
1373286 1375245 Because of Morpheus.
1375413 1380042 Because of what he's told me. He said<br />that this is it, that it will be over soon.
1380210 1384421 - Link, Morpheus is crazy.<br />- No doubt.
1384923 1388133 But Tank and Dozer believed him.<br />And I'll tell you what...
1388301 1393639 ...after being on that ship and seeing Neo<br />do the things he can do, I gotta say...
1393807 1395849 ...I'm starting to believe him too.
1400980 1403399 Be careful, Link.
1408738 1411115 Please be careful.
1420208 1423627 - They started yet?<br />- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
1423795 1426880 Tonight, let us honor<br />these men and women.
1427048 1429675 These are our soldiers, our warriors.
1429843 1434096 These are our husbands and wives,<br />our brothers and sisters...
1434264 1435931 ...our children.
1436516 1439643 Let us remember those<br />that have been lost...
1439811 1443021 ...and let us give thanks<br />for those that have been found...
1443189 1446483 ...and who stand here beside us.
1446693 1450362 Now I would like someone else<br />to close this prayer...
1450530 1453740 ...someone who hasn't spoken here<br />in a long time...
1453908 1459288 ...but who I believe has something to say<br />that we all need to hear.
1460290 1461874 I give you Morpheus.
1481394 1485564 Zion! Hear me!
1486566 1489693 It is true what many of you have heard.
1489861 1493864 The machines have gathered<br />an army, and as I speak...
1494032 1497951 ...that army is drawing nearer to our home.
1498122 1499158 (CHATTERING)
1499412 1504082 Believe me when I say we have<br />a difficult time ahead of us.
1504751 1510923 But if we are to be prepared for it,<br />we must first shed our fear of it.
1511424 1516345 I stand here before you now<br />truthfully unafraid.
1516930 1518680 Why?
1519098 1521934 Because I believe something you do not?
1522101 1523936 No!
1524229 1529191 I stand here without fear<br />because I remember.
1529359 1533278 I remember that I am here not because<br />of the path that lies before me...
1533446 1536782 ...but because of the path<br />that lies behind me.
1536950 1541620 I remember that for 100 years<br />we have fought these machines.
1541788 1546542 I remember that for 100 years<br />they have sent their armies to destroy us.
1546709 1552798 And after a century of war,<br />I remember that which matters most:
1553675 1556677 We are still here!
1563393 1565477 Tonight...
1565645 1569022 ...let us send a message to that army.
1569190 1572234 Tonight, let us shake this cave.
1572402 1576280 Tonight, let us tremble these halls...
1576447 1579575 ...of earth, steel and stone.
1579742 1584997 Let us be heard from red core<br />to black sky.
1585164 1589710 Tonight, let us make them remember:
1589877 1594840 This is Zion and we are not afraid!
1618197 1620198 NIOBE: I remember.
1621034 1623452 I remember you used to dance.
1625079 1628373 I remember you were pretty good.
1629125 1632377 There are some things in this world,<br />Captain Niobe...
1633171 1635964 ...that will never change.
1637258 1639176 LOCK: Niobe!
1643890 1645641 Some things do change.
1664911 1666745 Excuse me.
1678591 1682094 - I missed you.<br />- I can tell.
1682553 1686264 I was thinking, everyone is here.
1686808 1689101 Follow me.

1890094 1893680 Neo, what is it?
1893973 1896224 What's wrong?
1897810 1900145 It's okay, you can tell me.
1900521 1903023 Trinity...
1903190 1905984 Don't be afraid.
1906152 1908486 I can't lose you.
1908654 1910530 You're not gonna lose me.
1914660 1917537 You feel this?
1917705 1919497 I'm never letting go.

1977014 1979099 It doesn't matter now.<br />All that matters is this.

2077490 2079991 It's nice tonight.
2080493 2082911 Very calm.
2083079 2085830 It feels like everyone is sleeping<br />very peacefully.
2086207 2088666 Not everyone.
2088959 2093671 I hate sleeping.<br />I never sleep more than a few hours.
2093839 2097884 I figure I slept the first 11 years<br />of my life, now I'm making up for it.
2098344 2103056 - What about you?<br />- I just haven't been able to sleep much.
2104517 2107685 - It's a good sign.<br />- Of what?
2107853 2111022 That you are in fact still human.
2114610 2118530 Have you ever been<br />to the engineering level?
2118697 2121741 I love to walk there at night.<br />It's quite amazing.
2121909 2124452 - Would you like to see it?<br />- Sure.
2124873 2127456 (RUMBLING)
2135131 2139592 Almost no one comes down here.<br />Unless, of course, there's a problem.
2139760 2144848 That's how it is with people. Nobody cares<br />how it works as long as it works.
2145015 2147308 I like it down here.
2147476 2153273 I like to be reminded this city survives<br />because of these machines.
2153440 2158570 These machines are keeping us alive<br />while other machines are coming to kill us.
2158988 2163825 Interesting, isn't it?<br />The power to give life...
2163993 2167203 ...and the power to end it.<br />- We have the same power.
2167371 2170081 Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
2170249 2173710 ...down here sometimes I think about those<br />people still plugged into the Matrix.
2173878 2176880 And when I look at these machines...
2177047 2182135 ...I can't help thinking that, in a way,<br />we are plugged into them.
2182428 2185305 But we control these machines,<br />they don't control us.
2185723 2188725 Of course not. How could they?
2188893 2191436 The idea is pure nonsense...
2191937 2195064 ...but it does make one wonder just...
2195232 2196816 ...what is control?
2197067 2200111 If we wanted, we could<br />shut these machines down.
2200487 2204949 Of course. That's it. You hit it.<br />That's control, isn't it?
2205576 2208953 If we wanted,<br />we could smash them to bits.
2209205 2213333 Although if we did, we'd have to consider<br />what would happen to our lights...
2213500 2216169 ...our heat, our air.
2217171 2221299 So we need machines and they need us.<br />Is that your point, councillor?
2221467 2224093 No. No point.
2224803 2228890 Old men like me don't bother<br />with making points. There's no point.
2229683 2233478 Is that why there are no young men<br />on the Council?
2233646 2235313 Good point.
2236023 2240193 Why don't you tell me<br />what's on your mind, councillor.
2240361 2243613 There is so much in this world...
2243781 2246699 ...that I do not understand.
2248494 2253248 See that machine? It has something to do<br />with recycling our water supply.
2253415 2256417 I have absolutely no idea how it works.
2256585 2260672 But I do understand the reason<br />for it to work.
2262174 2266678 I have absolutely no idea how you<br />are able to do some of the things you do.
2267846 2271015 But I believe there's a reason for that<br />as well.
2271892 2277021 I only hope we understand that reason<br />before it's too late.
2283529 2285196 - Ballard.<br />- Is he here?
2287616 2290201 Neo, it's from the Oracle.
2293163 2294872 It's time to go.
2295833 2298293 Morpheus said this was how<br />it was gonna happen.
2298460 2302880 I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,<br />maybe it's not.
2303424 2306592 All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
2308178 2310054 Right now, that operator's me.
2310681 2312765 I know.
2317730 2319397 - Zee...<br />- I want you to wear it.
2319565 2322650 - You know I don't believe in this stuff.<br />- But I do.
2322943 2325903 It's always brought me luck.
2326071 2330199 - Maybe it'll bring me you.<br />- I'm coming back.
2330367 2334912 I promise. No matter what it takes,<br />I'm coming home.
2335622 2339250 Just keep it with you. Please.
2339418 2341502 For me.

2372117 2373826 No, I'm fine.
2373994 2376788 I just wanted to catch you to say...
2376955 2378790 ...good luck.
2380459 2382168 Thanks.
2382336 2384754 We'll see you.
2386340 2389425 Neo! Just in time.
2389593 2391928 - You're gonna see the Oracle. Aren't you?<br />- We don't have time.
2392096 2393721 I had to give something to Neo.
2394431 2397141 A gift from one of the orphans.
2397309 2400728 He made me swear to get it to you<br />before you left.
2401605 2404065 He said you'd understand.
2406735 2408861 Thanks.
2415953 2418871 I was just told you cleared<br />the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
2419039 2420998 That is correct.
2421166 2423126 Councilor am I still in charge<br />of our defense system?
2423293 2424585 Of course.
2425295 2429340 I believe I need every ship we have<br />if we're going to survive this attack.
2429925 2432093 I understand that, commander.
2432261 2434846 Then why did you allow<br />the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
2435013 2439892 Because I believe our survival depends<br />on more than how many ships we have.

2486231 2489775 - You seek the Oracle.<br />- Who are you?
2492821 2497325 I am Seraph. I can take you to her,<br />but first I must apologize.
2497576 2499285 Apologize for what?
2499953 2501746 For this.
2559054 2561305 Good.
2563809 2566978 The Oracle has many enemies.<br />I had to be sure.
2567145 2569355 - Of what?<br />- That you are the One.
2569815 2573568 - You could have just asked.<br />- No. You do not truly know someone...
2573735 2575987 ...until you fight them.
2576530 2579991 Come. She's waiting.
2595048 2596924 Where the hell did they go?
2597301 2600011 These are back doors, aren't they?
2600178 2603097 Programmer access.
2604182 2607935 - How do they work?<br />- A code is hidden in tumblers.
2608103 2613107 One position opens a lock and another<br />position opens one of these doors.
2614860 2617695 Are you a programmer?
2617863 2620197 Then what are you?
2622367 2625870 I protect that which matters most.
2645390 2648768 ORACLE: Well, come on.<br />I ain't gonna bite you.
2649186 2651979 Come around here<br />and let me have a look at you.
2655192 2657568 My goodness, look at you.
2657903 2660738 You turned out all right, didn't you?
2660906 2663115 How do you feel?
2663283 2666869 I know you're not sleeping.<br />We'll get to that.
2667037 2669747 Why don't you come<br />and have a sit this time.
2670457 2674585 - Maybe I'll stand.<br />- Well, suit yourself.
2685722 2688265 - I felt like sitting.<br />- I know.
2689434 2691352 So...
2693438 2695856 ...let's get the obvious stuff<br />out of the way.
2696149 2700611 - You're not human, are you?<br />- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
2700779 2706617 If I had to guess, I'd say you're<br />a program from the machine world.
2706993 2711205 - So is he.<br />- So far, so good.
2711373 2714542 But if that's true, that could mean<br />you're part of this system...
2714710 2717294 ...another kind of control.
2717462 2721966 - Keep going.<br />- I suppose the most obvious question is...
2722134 2726053 ...how can I trust you?<br />- Bingo.
2727097 2730349 It is a pickle, no doubt about it.<br />Bad news is...
2730517 2734186 ...there's no way you can really know<br />what around here to help you or not.
2734354 2737898 So it's really up to you. Just have<br />to make up your own damn mind...
2738066 2742862 ...to either accept what<br />I'm going to tell you or reject it.
2744156 2746323 Candy?
2749035 2753456 - Do you already know if I'm going to take it?<br />- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
2753623 2756834 But if you already know,<br />how can I make a choice?
2757002 2761046 Because you didn't come here to make<br />the choice. You've already made it.
2761214 2765843 You're here to try to understand<br />why you made it.
2771391 2774351 I thought you'd have figured that out<br />by now.
2776104 2778689 - Why are you here?<br />- Same reason.
2778940 2781692 I love candy.
2781860 2784695 But why help us?
2784863 2788365 We're all here to do<br />what we're all here to do.
2788909 2791994 I'm interested in one thing, Neo:<br />the future.
2792162 2796373 And believe me, I know, the only way<br />to get there is together.
2797209 2802129 - Are there other programs like you?<br />- Well, not like me, but...
2802297 2804965 Look. See those birds?
2805217 2808594 At some point, a program was written<br />to govern them.
2808762 2814600 A program was written to watch over the<br />trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
2814851 2817728 There are programs running<br />all over the place.
2817896 2822358 The ones doing their job, doing what<br />they were meant to do, are invisible.
2822526 2826362 You'd never even know they were here.<br />But the other ones...
2826530 2830616 Well, you hear about them all the time.
2831201 2834078 - I've never heard of them.<br />- Of course you have.
2834246 2839166 Every time you've heard someone<br />say they saw a ghost or an angel...
2839334 2843921 ...every story you've ever heard about<br />vampires, werewolves or aliens...
2844089 2846423 ...is the system assimilating<br />some program...
2846591 2851262 ...that's doing something<br />they're not supposed to be doing.
2851429 2854431 Programs hacking programs.
2854599 2857476 - Why?<br />- They have their reasons...
2857644 2861605 ...but usually a program chooses exile<br />when it faces deletion.
2862023 2865943 - And why would a program be deleted?<br />- Maybe it breaks down.
2866111 2870656 Maybe a better program is created<br />to replace it. Happens all the time.
2870824 2875786 And when it does, a program<br />can either choose to hide here...
2875954 2878622 ...or return to the source.
2880292 2883586 - The machine mainframe.<br />- Yes.
2883753 2886255 Where you must go.
2886423 2890634 Where the path of the One ends.<br />You've seen it...
2891803 2894638 ...in your dreams, haven't you?
2894806 2897641 A door made of light?
2899895 2903439 What happens when you go through<br />the door?
2905567 2908569 I see Trinity...
2908737 2911906 ...and something happens...
2912073 2913991 ...something bad.
2914159 2918162 She starts to fall,<br />and then I wake up.
2919205 2923083 - Do you see her die?<br />- No.
2923877 2926921 You have the sight now, Neo.
2927088 2930090 You are looking at the world<br />without time.
2930258 2932676 Then why can't I see<br />what happens to her?
2932844 2936597 We can never see past the choices<br />we don't understand.
2936765 2939934 Are you saying I have to choose<br />whether Trinity lives or dies?
2940185 2943979 No, you've already made the choice.
2944147 2946690 Now you have to understand it.
2947317 2948692 No.
2948860 2952112 I can't do that. I won't.
2952822 2955199 - Well, you have to.<br />- Why?
2955784 2958869 Because you're the One.
2961039 2964041 What if I can't?
2964209 2966210 What happens if I fail?
2966795 2969797 Then Zion will fall.
2977263 2982142 Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.<br />You can save Zion...
2982310 2985646 ...if you reach the source, but to do that<br />you will need the Keymaker.
2985814 2986855 The Keymaker?
2987023 2990609 Yes, He disappeared sometime ago. Which we<br />didn't know what happened to him until now.
2990777 2994530 He's being held prisoner<br />by a very dangerous program...
2994698 2998242 ...one of the oldest of us.<br />He is called the Merovingian.
2998410 3001286 - And he won't let him go willingly.<br />- What does he want?
3001454 3006291 What do all men with power want?<br />More power.
3007002 3010254 Be there at that exact time...
3010422 3013090 ...and you will have a chance.
3013883 3016135 We must go.
3016302 3021682 Seems like every time we meet<br />I got nothing but bad news.
3022267 3025144 I'm sorry about that. I surely am.
3025311 3028063 But for what it's worth...
3029107 3032776 ...you've made a believer out of me.
3034070 3036196 Good luck, kiddo.

3078698 3081366 I don't fully understand how it happened.
3081534 3084912 Perhaps some part of you<br />imprinted onto me...
3085080 3087748 ...something overwritten or copied.
3087916 3090626 It is, at this point, irrelevant.<br />What matters is...
3090794 3093879 ...that whatever happened,<br />happened for a reason.
3094047 3095714 And what reason is that?
3096174 3100135 I killed you, Mr. Anderson.<br />I watched you die.
3100303 3103555 With a certain satisfaction,<br />I might add.

3109938 3113107 You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

3127664 3131208 ...compelled to disobey.
3131793 3135546 And now, here I stand<br />because of you, Mr. Anderson.
3135713 3139675 Because of you, I'm no longer an agent<br />of this system.
3139843 3143053 Because of you, I've changed.<br />I'm unplugged.
3143221 3148058 A new man, so to speak.<br />Like you, apparently free.
3148393 3149768 Congratulations.
3150520 3152855 Thank you.
3153439 3158068 But as you well know,<br />appearances can be deceiving...
3158236 3163407 ...which brings me back to the reason<br />why we're here.
3163575 3168453 We're not here because we're free.<br />We're here because we are not free.
3168621 3172541 There's no escaping reason,<br />no denying purpose.
3172709 3176086 Because as we both know,<br />without purpose...
3176254 3181091 ...we would not exist.<br />- It is purpose that created us.
3181259 3184261 - Purpose that connects us.<br />- SMITH 4: Purpose that pulls us.
3184429 3186263 - SMITH 5: That guides us.<br />- SMITH 6: That drives us.
3186431 3191143 - It is purpose that defines.<br />- Purpose that binds us.
3191311 3193770 We are here because of you,<br />Mr. Anderson.
3193938 3198317 We're here to take from you<br />what you tried to take from us:
3200278 3202362 Purpose.
3205450 3207326 - What's happening to him?<br />- Don't know.
3210371 3213957 Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
3320815 3323275 - You.<br />- Yes, me.
3327447 3330324 Me, me, me.
3335204 3336872 Me too.
3449321 3451438 (SCREAMS)
3464625 3465667 More.
3527939 3530774 It is inevitable.
3531192 3532609 Come on, get out of there.
3575820 3578154 Are you all right?
3579240 3581157 - It was Smith.<br />- Yes.
3582034 3584661 - MORPHEUS: Now there's more than one?<br />- A lot more.
3584829 3588623 - How is that possible?<br />- I don't know.
3588791 3591251 Somehow, he's found a way<br />to copy himself.
3591419 3595630 - Is that what he was doing to you?<br />- I don't know what he was doing...
3595798 3598550 ...but I know what it felt like.<br />- What?
3599468 3603179 It felt like I was back in that hallway.
3603347 3604764 It felt like dying.
3605266 3608143 The machines are tunneling to avoid<br />our defense system.
3608311 3612147 But I believe they going to intersect<br />certain pipelines in order to control them.
3612315 3614858 These points of intersection<br />are crucial...
3615026 3617819 ...because I believe they're<br />vulnerable to counterattack.
3617987 3622032 Although it has been suggested that<br />this is the same kind of attack...
3622199 3625869 ...we've defended for years,<br />I urge the Council to realize the truth.
3626037 3629372 This is the single greatest threat<br />we have ever faced...
3629540 3633376 ...and if we do not act accordingly,<br />we will not survive.
3633544 3637547 Commander Lock, the Council is well<br />aware of the seriousness of this attack.
3637840 3642385 You have our leave to prepare our defense<br />by any and all means necessary.
3642553 3645221 - Thank you, Council.<br />- DILLARD: However...
3645473 3648808 ...we ask if there's been word<br />from the Nebuchadnezzar.
3649060 3651561 No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
3653189 3657150 Then we request a ship be dispatched<br />to ascertain the fate of the One.
3657318 3661071 I wish that were possible, councillor,<br />but I do not believe our defense...
3661238 3664783 ...can suffer the loss of another ship.<br />- It will, commander, if it must.
3664950 3667285 It could take single ship days<br />to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
3667453 3670497 - Then send two.<br />- This is insane.
3670665 3673667 Careful, commander.
3673876 3677212 Forgive my frustration, councillors.
3677380 3681257 But I wish I were able to comprehend<br />the Council's choice in this matter.
3681425 3684594 Comprehension is not<br />a requisite of cooperation.
3684762 3687222 If you are asking me<br />to order two of my captains...
3687390 3689099 There's no need for such an order.
3689266 3692811 The captains are present.<br />They can answer for themselves.
3693270 3698525 The Council is calling for two volunteers<br />to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
3698693 3702862 Are there two among you<br />that would answer such call?
3704156 3707951 Captain Soren of the Vigilant<br />will answer the Council's call.
3708119 3711037 You understand the situation,<br />Captain Soren?
3711205 3713665 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Thank you, captain.
3715084 3716501 Is there another?
3717294 3721005 - Captain, I think we should volunteer.<br />- What? You have gone crazy.
3721173 3723049 - Listen...<br />- Shut your hole, Bane...
3723217 3724718 ...before I put you in one.
3734562 3736312 Is there no other?
3737064 3738982 Be hard for any man to risk his life...
3739150 3742110 ...especially if he doesn't<br />understand the reason.
3742570 3746072 Captain Niobe of the Logos<br />will answer the councillor's call.
3746240 3748491 - What?<br />- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
3748701 3753788 Commander Lock, you have your orders.<br />This Council is hereby adjourned.
3758502 3761087 - Niobe, what are you doing?<br />- What I can.
3761255 3762297 Why?
3763591 3766843 Because some things<br />never change, Jason...
3767011 3769345 ...and some things do.
3785780 3787197 What can you see, Neo?
3787364 3789699 It's strange.<br />The code is somehow different.
3789867 3791451 - Encrypted?<br />- Maybe.
3791619 3793578 Is that good for us or bad for us?
3794288 3797415 Well, it looks like every floor<br />is wired with explosives.
3798042 3799584 Bad for us.
3800002 3801503 Here we go.
3807470 3808836 (SPEAKS IN FRENCH)
3809512 3812430 Yes. We are here to speak<br />with the Merovingian.
3812890 3816726 Well, of course.<br />He has been expecting you.
3816894 3817936 Follow me.
3838624 3842293 A-ha. Here he is at last.
3842503 3845797 Neo, the One himself.
3845965 3847382 Right?
3847550 3849884 And the legendary Morpheus.
3850719 3855598 And Trinity, of course.<br />I have heard so much.
3855766 3859227 You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.<br />This is my wife, Persephone.
3860145 3863439 Something to eat? Drink?
3863732 3866776 Of course, such things are contrivances,<br />like so much here.
3866944 3869445 For the sake of appearances.
3869613 3873074 - No, thank you.<br />- Yes, of course. Who has time?
3873242 3878329 Who has time? But then, if we do not ever<br />take time, how can we ever have time?
3882042 3885420 Château Haut-Briond, 1959.<br />Magnificent wine.
3885588 3888506 I love French wine<br />like I love the French language.
3888674 3892844 I have sampled every language. French<br />is my favorite. Fantastic language...
3893012 3895138 ...especially to curse with.
3895433 3897971 (SPEAKS IN FRENCH)
3899143 3903688 You see? It's like wiping your ass<br />with silk. I love it.
3905316 3907066 You know why we are here.
3908819 3913698 I am a trafficker of information.<br />I know everything I can.
3914116 3919954 The question is,<br />do you know why you are here?
3920247 3922707 We are looking for the Keymaker.
3923375 3927879 Oh, yes, it is true.<br />The Keymaker, of course.
3928047 3931007 But this is not a reason,<br />this is not a why.
3931175 3934928 The Keymaker himself, his very nature,<br />is a means, it is not an end.
3935095 3940850 And so to look for him is to be<br />looking for a means to do...
3941018 3944187 ...what?<br />- You know the answer to that question.
3944355 3946481 But do you?
3946690 3949025 You think you do, but you do not.
3949193 3952403 You are here<br />because you were sent here.
3952571 3955698 You were told to come here,<br />and then you obeyed.
3956867 3959202 It is, of course, the way of all things.
3959370 3962038 You see, there is only one constant...
3962206 3966376 ...one universal.<br />It is the only real truth.
3966543 3968211 Causality.
3968379 3970672 Action, reaction.
3970839 3975051 - Cause and effect.<br />- Everything begins with choice.
3975219 3976970 No. Wrong.
3977137 3981724 Choice is an illusion created<br />between those with power...
3981892 3983977 ...and those without.
3985521 3988690 Look there at that woman.
3989400 3993319 My God, just look at her...
3993570 3996239 ...affecting everyone around her.
3996407 4001160 So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.<br />But wait.
4001412 4005164 Watch. You see, I have sent her<br />a dessert...
4005374 4009585 ...a very special dessert.
4013924 4016384 I wrote it myself.
4016552 4019762 It starts so simply...
4019930 4024517 ...each line of the program creating<br />a new effect, just like...
4025561 4027186 ...poetry.
4027354 4028771 First...
4029273 4034694 ...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
4035279 4037905 You can see it, Neo, yes?
4038532 4041117 She does not understand why.
4041368 4043786 Is it the wine? No.
4043954 4046330 What is it then? What is the reason?
4046957 4049292 And soon it does not matter.
4049460 4052462 Soon the why and the reason are gone...
4053422 4058968 ...and all that matters<br />is the feeling itself.
4059428 4062513 And this is the nature of the universe.
4062681 4065224 We struggle against it,<br />we fight to deny it...
4065392 4067977 ...but it is, of course, pretense.<br />It is a lie.
4068145 4072148 Beneath our poised appearance...
4072316 4077612 ...the truth is, we are completely...
4080491 4083367 ...out of control.
4088707 4093586 Causality. There is no escape from it.<br />We are forever slaves to it.
4094004 4099467 Our only hope, our only peace,<br />is to understand it, to understand the why.
4099635 4103054 "Why" is what separates us from them...
4103222 4105515 ...you from me.
4105682 4109435 "Why" is the only real source of power.<br />Without it, you are powerless.
4109603 4112897 And this is how you come to me,<br />without why, without power.
4113065 4115858 Another link in the chain.
4116068 4117360 But fear not.
4117528 4121405 Since I have seen how good you are<br />at following orders...
4121573 4124200 ...I will tell you what to do next.
4124701 4129539 Run back and give the fortune-teller<br />this message:
4129748 4134001 Her time is almost up.
4135045 4138589 Now I have some real business to do,<br />so I will say adieu and goodbye.
4138757 4141259 - This isn't over.<br />- Oh, yes, it is.
4141426 4147807 The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason<br />why I should give him up.
4147975 4152019 - No reason at all.<br />- Where are you going?
4152187 4156899 Please, ma cherie, I have told you.<br />We are all victims of causality.
4157067 4160403 I drank too much wine,<br />I must take a piss.
4160904 4164031 Cause and effect. Au Revoir.
4169079 4172165 Touch me and that hand<br />will never touch anything again.
4181049 4182550 Well, that didn't go so well.
4182718 4185094 Are you certain the Oracle<br />didn't say anything else?
4185262 4187388 - Yes.<br />- Maybe we did something wrong.
4188056 4189390 Or didn't do something.
4189558 4192810 No, what happen, happened couldn't<br />happened any other way.
4192978 4195730 - How do you know?<br />- We are still alive.
4195900 4196936 (ELEVATOR BELL RINGS)
4199026 4202278 If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
4209286 4211370 Get out.
4213290 4219629 I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.<br />On and on. Pompous prick.
4220214 4225718 A long time ago, when we first came here,<br />it was so different.
4227471 4230181 He was so different.
4231975 4234602 He was like you.
4237314 4241108 I'll give you what you want,<br />but you have to give me something.
4241860 4244153 - What?<br />- A kiss.
4244529 4245655 Excuse me?
4247157 4251077 I want you to kiss me<br />as if you were kissing her.
4252996 4256582 - Why?<br />- You love her. She loves you.
4256833 4258793 It's all over you both.
4259461 4264006 A long time ago,<br />I knew what that felt like.
4265342 4271097 I want to remember it.<br />I want to sample it. That's all.
4271348 4273182 Just a sample.
4273350 4276352 - Why don't you sample this instead?<br />- Trinity.
4278563 4283526 Such emotion over something so small.<br />It's just a kiss.
4283694 4285861 Why should we trust you?
4286029 4290032 If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,<br />she can kill me.
4297124 4299250 All right.
4299543 4303379 But you have to make me believe<br />I am her.
4304589 4306632 All right.
4312973 4314807 Terrible. Forget it.
4317769 4319228 Wait.
4320147 4321689 Okay.
4358769 4360853 Yes.
4361438 4363939 That's it.
4378705 4384126 I envy you. But such a thing<br />is not meant to last.
4387130 4388506 Come with me.
4419579 4421330 Not again.
4424751 4427378 It's all right, boys. They're with me.
4428046 4430423 These fellas work for my husband.
4430590 4434427 They do his dirty work.<br />They're very good, very loyal.
4434594 4436137 Aren't you, boys?
4436304 4437346 MAN 1 & 2: Yes, mistress.
4437514 4440224 They come from a much older version<br />of the Matrix.
4440392 4444562 But like so many back then, they caused<br />more problems than they solved.
4445313 4450317 My husband saved them because<br />they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
4450485 4454530 How many people keep silver bullets<br />in their gun?
4459244 4462455 You can either run to the restaurant<br />to tell my husband what I have done...
4462622 4465207 ...or you can stay there and die.

4527938 4532233 What cause? How about the lipstick<br />you're still wearing?

4535278 4539114 What craziness are you talking about,<br />woman? There is no lipstick!

4563473 4567059 All right.
4567310 4570104 Let us find out where this goes.
4570272 4573148 You two, get the Keymaker.

4984602 4987229 Yes sir the only exit I got<br />near you is the Winslow overpass.
4987397 4989481 - Off the freeway.<br />- Yes, sir.
4989649 4993402 - Fine, we'll make it.<br />- Sir I think I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!
4998408 4999992 - Incoming fire.<br />- Down!
5008251 5009418 Hold on!
5026436 5028937 Oh, no. This is getting real ugly<br />real fast.
5029105 5030814 Are you watching this, Link?
5030982 5034609 Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.<br />Eight units headed your way.
5035653 5037612 Any suggestions?
5039490 5041491 - Turn right.<br />- Right, now.
5048958 5051793 LINK: Now straight here.<br />You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
5051961 5054671 - MORPHEUS: Got it.<br />- Sir are you sure about this? The freeway, I mean. It's dangerous.
5054839 5058550 - In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...<br />- Link, what did I tell you?
5058843 5061136 Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
5061304 5063805 - I'll be ready for you.<br />- Good man.
5063973 5066141 You always told me<br />to stay off the freeway.
5066309 5068935 - Yes, that's true.<br />- You said it was suicide.
5069145 5071063 Then let us hope...
5071230 5072606 ...that I was wrong.
5083287 5084323 (PHONE RINGS)
5084494 5085577 - Operator.<br />- Link, it's Niobe.
5085745 5087370 We've been sent to bring you in.
5087538 5090624 - I need to talk to Morpheus.<br />- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
5090792 5092793 - Where is he?<br />- Just follow the sirens.
5100343 5102260 Repeat, they're approaching the...
5105431 5109643 - We have them now.<br />- The exile is the primary target.
5172790 5174249 MAN: Shots fired.
5176878 5178753 Move!
5288739 5291950 - We are getting aggravated.<br />- Yes, we are.
5337997 5339998 Trinity.
5340416 5341541 Get him out of here.
5345171 5347255 Come on!
5364273 5365774 Crush him.
5396263 5397305 Morpheus.
5397473 5398973 He's okay. Keep moving.
5399975 5401768 Let's go.
5407525 5409692 I need a download<br />to hot-wire a motorcycle.
5409860 5412195 No problem.<br />One crash course on motorcycle...
5412363 5413780 Wait.
5415157 5416616 Cancel that.
5416784 5418993 You are handy.
5419161 5421079 Jump on.
5568352 5569394 She means nothing.
5569562 5572689 - Find the exile.<br />- We have them.
5573023 5575149 MAN: One-Adam-12, please respond.
5581615 5583324 Get down.
5714331 5715957 Gotcha.
5716709 5717792 She's good.
5722172 5724465 You are no longer necessary.
5731140 5734851 We do only what we're meant to do.
5736478 5740064 Then you are meant for one more thing:<br />deletion.
5741024 5742900 Go kick his ass.
5792951 5795703 Neo, if you're out there,<br />I could use some help.
5796455 5797914 What is that?
5827778 5830655 Yes! Yes!
5837246 5842375 Sir we have confirmation from the Icarus. The first<br />two ships are in position for counterattack.
5842626 5843668 Good.
5844670 5845711 Any change?
5845879 5848631 They slightly hit some iron ore here.<br />Certain down there.
5848799 5851926 - How much?<br />- An hour, maybe.
5852094 5854637 That would give them<br />a little over nine hours.
5855472 5857098 Yes, sir.
5889715 5891966 KEYMAKER: There is a building.
5892134 5897805 Inside this building, there is a level<br />where no elevator can go...
5897973 5899891 ...and no stair can reach.
5900559 5906647 This level is filled with doors.<br />These doors lead to many places.
5906815 5909150 Hidden places.
5909484 5913112 But one door is special.
5913280 5915489 One door leads to the source.
5923832 5928252 This building is protected<br />by a very secure system.
5928420 5932924 - Every alarm triggers the bomb.<br />- Bomb? Did he say bomb?
5933175 5935843 KEYMAKER: But like all systems,<br />it has a weakness.
5936011 5939013 The system is based on the rules<br />of a building.
5939181 5942558 - One system built on another.<br />- Electricity.
5943101 5947855 - If one fails, so must the other.<br />- No electricity, no alarms.
5948023 5950858 You'd have to take out a whole city block<br />to kill the power on a building like that.
5951026 5954737 - Not one, 27.<br />- Twenty-seven blocks?
5955572 5958032 KEYMAKER: There is a power station.
5958200 5960451 It must be destroyed.
5960619 5964956 - There must be some kind of fail-safe.<br />- Yes, there is an emergency system.
5966583 5970378 The core network of the grid<br />must be accessed.
5970545 5973381 The emergency system<br />must be deactivated.
5973548 5974966 SOREN: What do you need us for?
5975133 5977301 Neo could take both them out<br />easier than we could.
5977469 5979220 - There's no time.<br />- Why?
5979388 5982515 Once the door is unprotected,<br />the connection will be severed.
5982683 5984976 But another connection<br />must first be made.
5985811 5989647 - SOREN: How long will that take?<br />- KEYMAKER: Exactly 314 seconds.
5989815 5991399 MAN: Just over five minutes.
5991566 5993818 KEYMAKER: That is the length<br />and breadth of the window.
5993986 5996278 Only the One can open the door...
5996488 5999407 ...and only during that window<br />can the door be opened.
6000659 6002243 How do you know all this?
6002411 6007581 I know because I must know.<br />It is my purpose.
6007749 6013254 It's the reason I'm here,<br />the same reason we're all here.
6024016 6026809 Neo, I know something's wrong.
6027477 6029520 You don't have to tell me.
6029688 6033441 I just want you to know that I'm here.
6036987 6038446 All must be done as one.
6043201 6044869 Can't hurt.
6048415 6050499 If one fails...
6051293 6053002 ...all fail.
6053503 6057173 At midnight, there is a shift change<br />in the security of both buildings.
6057343 6058379 (ELEVATOR BELL RINGS)
6058550 6061802 MORPHEUS: At midnight, we will strike.
6062429 6063512 GUARD: Hey!
6063680 6067641 - You can't sleep at home.<br />- Why? I get paid to count them here.
6077819 6080029 Okay, they're inside.
6080197 6082698 - How much time?<br />- Twelve minutes.
6082868 6084985 (BEEPING)
6085410 6086494 Oh, shit.
6089873 6095336 All of our lives, we have fought this war.<br />Tonight, I believe we can end it.
6096838 6099006 Tonight is not an accident.
6100342 6102343 There are no accidents.
6103720 6108766 We have not come here by chance.<br />I do not believe in chance.
6108934 6114522 When I see three objectives,<br />three captains, three ships...
6114689 6118192 ...I do not see coincidence.<br />I see providence.
6118527 6120861 I see purpose.
6123573 6129912 I believe it is our fate to be here.<br />It is our destiny.
6130080 6135084 I believe this night holds<br />for each and every one of us...
6135252 6138587 ...the very meaning of our lives.
6138755 6142925 I want to ask you to do something,<br />but I don't know how.
6143510 6145427 I promise you, if I can, I will.
6146763 6150099 What if I asked you to stay out of this...
6151059 6153060 ...no matter what...
6153228 6155563 ...to stay out of the Matrix?
6156648 6158440 Why?
6166658 6167741 Please.
6169828 6171162 All right.
6174499 6177001 What is it, Niobe?
6177169 6181297 I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't<br />help thinking, what if you're wrong?
6181464 6184758 What if all this, the prophecy,<br />everything, is bullshit?
6184926 6188929 Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
6189347 6191974 But how would that be different<br />from any other day?
6201443 6207948 This is a war, and we are soldiers.
6208200 6211118 Death can come for us at any time...
6211661 6213454 ...in any place.
6213622 6215539 Incoming. Incoming!
6217500 6219126 Incoming!
6225050 6227509 Now consider the alternative.
6227677 6232264 What if I am right?<br />What if the prophecy is true?
6232432 6236852 What if tomorrow the war could be over?
6237812 6240814 Isn't that worth fighting for?
6241942 6244568 Isn't that worth dying for?
6245487 6248113 - Time?<br />- Three minutes.
6248281 6249406 Almost there.
6249785 6252027 (BEEPING)
6264216 6266003 (RUMBLING)
6269469 6270844 It is done.
6271012 6272304 Find the others.
6273431 6275683 I got Niobe right there.<br />They're already out of the station.
6275850 6278519 - What about Soren?<br />- There.
6278687 6280521 They're still inside, but...
6281398 6282439 They're not moving.
6306589 6308507 That's it, let's go.
6310635 6312469 Call Neo now.
6316433 6319268 - I lost them. They're inside the portal.<br />- What about the grid?
6323398 6326900 Everything is still operational. The<br />emergency system is already rerouting power.
6332574 6334742 Jesus.
6334909 6338954 Soon as they open that door,<br />it's all over.
6339122 6341081 The hell it is.
6341833 6343167 LINK: What are you...? Trinity!
6344461 6347421 I will not stand here and do nothing.<br />I will not wait here to watch them die.
6347589 6349757 We're talking less than five minutes.
6349924 6352426 In five minutes,<br />I'll tear that whole damn building down.
6352594 6356138 - How much further?<br />- Here, just here.
6357432 6361435 I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
6362604 6365105 It's gotta be the ugliest hack<br />I have ever done.
6368318 6371445 That's as close as I can get you.<br />You better grow some wings.
6388591 6389877 (PHONE RINGS)
6390048 6391090 - Operator.<br />- TRINITY: I'm in.
6391257 6393425 Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
6394010 6398180 You look surprised to see me again,<br />Mr. Anderson.
6398348 6403727 Well, that's the difference between us.<br />I have been expecting you.
6403895 6406814 - What do you want, Smith?<br />- SMITH: You haven't figured that out?
6406981 6412486 Still using all the muscles<br />except the one that matters.
6412654 6415322 I want exactly what you want.
6415490 6417574 I want everything.
6418034 6420536 Would that include a bullet<br />from this gun?
6420703 6422496 Go ahead, shoot.
6422664 6427960 The best thing about being me,<br />there's so many me's.
6439347 6442975 Christ! What the hell happened in here?
6443852 6445894 Hold it right there, little lady.
6455238 6457030 If you can't beat us...
6457198 6459032 Join us.
6461202 6462286 Morpheus!
6475884 6479011 Still no sight of them. I don't know what they're<br />doing but they only got two minutes left.
6492775 6493817 One minute.
6503036 6507164 Come on.
6507749 6509625 Please.
6519552 6521094 Kill them.
6528978 6530020 They're in.
6530188 6532147 I don't believe it.
6547705 6549831 It was meant to be.
6549999 6555379 Morpheus, that door will take you home.
6564138 6568475 You will know which door.<br />Hurry, Neo.
6573982 6577150 Trinity, I got some serious activity<br />headed your way.
6629454 6630829 Hello, Neo.
6631372 6635167 - Who are you?<br />- I am the Architect.
6635335 6638962 I created the Matrix.<br />I've been waiting for you.
6639213 6643383 You have many questions. Though the<br />process has altered your consciousness...
6643551 6645552 ...you remain irrevocably human.
6645720 6649306 Ergo, some of my answers you will<br />understand and some others you will not.
6649724 6653769 Concordantly, while your first question<br />may be the most pertinent...
6653936 6657648 ...you may or may not realize<br />it is also the most irrelevant.
6658524 6660150 Why am I here?
6660318 6664237 Your life is the sum of a remainder<br />of an unbalanced equation...
6664405 6666740 ...inherent to the programming<br />of the Matrix.
6666908 6670994 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,<br />which despite my sincerest efforts...
6671162 6673997 ...I've been unable to eliminate<br />from what is otherwise...
6674165 6678627 ...a harmony of mathematical precision.
6678961 6681296 While it remains a burden<br />assiduously avoided...
6681464 6685926 ...it is not unexpected and thus<br />not beyond a measure of control...
6686094 6690055 ...which has led you, inexorably...
6691015 6692265 ...here.
6692433 6696520 - You haven't answered my question.<br />- Quite right.
6696688 6700482 Interesting.<br />That was quicker than the others.
6700650 6703276 NEOS: Others? How many?<br />What others?
6703444 6705946 The Matrix is older than you know.
6706114 6710117 I prefer counting from the emergence of one<br />integral anomaly to the emergence of the next.
6710284 6712536 In which case, this is the sixth version.
6712704 6715163 NEOS: Five before me?<br />He's lying. Bullshit.
6715331 6718875 There are only two possible explanations.<br />There were five before me.
6719043 6720335 Either no one told me...
6721587 6725590 - ...or no one knows.<br />- Precisely.
6725758 6729052 As you are undoubtedly gathering,<br />the anomaly is systemic...
6729220 6732639 ...creating fluctuations in even<br />the most simplistic equations.
6732807 6736059 You can't control me!<br />I'm gonna smash you to bits!
6736227 6738019 I'm gonna fucking kill you!
6738187 6741356 You can't make me do anything.<br />You old, white prick!
6743651 6745152 Choice.
6745319 6747154 The problem is choice.
6747699 6748735 (ELEVATOR BELL RINGS)
6769385 6773013 The first Matrix I designed was quite<br />naturally perfect, it is a work of art.
6773181 6775015 Flawless, sublime.
6775183 6778685 A triumph equaled only<br />by its monumental failure.
6779353 6781772 The inevitability of its doom<br />is apparent now...
6781939 6785275 ...as a consequence of the imperfection<br />inherent in every human being.
6785443 6788403 Thus, I redesigned it<br />based on your history...
6788571 6792574 ...to more accurately reflect<br />the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
6793284 6797037 However, I was again frustrated<br />by failure.
6798498 6801124 I have since come to understand<br />that the answer eluded me...
6801292 6803335 ...because it required a lesser mind.
6803503 6809466 Or perhaps, a mind less bound<br />by the parameters of perfection.
6809884 6814304 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon<br />by another, an intuitive program...
6814472 6819267 ...initially created to investigate<br />certain aspects of the human psyche.
6819435 6825398 If I am the father of the Matrix,<br />she would undoubtedly be its mother.
6826025 6828318 - The Oracle.<br />- Please.
6829028 6833031 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br />solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
6833199 6836076 ...accepted the program, as long as they<br />were given a choice...
6836244 6840372 ...even if they were only aware<br />of the choice at a near unconscious level.
6840540 6843959 While this answer functioned,<br />it was obviously fundamentally flawed...
6844126 6848129 ...thus creating the otherwise<br />contradictory systemic anomaly...
6848297 6851007 ...that, if left unchecked,<br />might threaten the system itself.
6851384 6855512 Ergo, those that refused the program,<br />while a minority, if unchecked...
6855680 6859766 ...would constitute<br />an escalating probability of disaster.
6859934 6861726 This is about Zion.
6862186 6865856 You are here because Zion<br />is about to be destroyed.
6866023 6870443 Its every living inhabitant terminated,<br />its entire existence eradicated.
6870736 6871778 Bullshit.
6871946 6875115 Denial is the most predictable<br />of all human responses.
6875324 6881788 But rest assured, this will be<br />the sixth time we have destroyed it...
6881956 6885959 ...and we have become<br />exceedingly efficient at it.
6898681 6899973 The function of the One...
6900141 6904811 ...is now to return to the source, allowing a<br />temporary dissemination of the code you carry...
6904979 6906688 ...reinserting the prime program.
6907273 6911276 After which you will be required to select<br />from the Matrix 23 individuals...
6911444 6914696 ...sixteen female, seven male,<br />to rebuild Zion.
6914864 6919409 Failure to comply with this process will<br />result in a cataclysmic system crash...
6919577 6921912 ...killing everyone connected<br />to the Matrix...
6922079 6924664 ...which, coupled with the<br />extermination of Zion...
6924832 6929044 ...will ultimately result in the extinction<br />of the entire human race.
6929378 6933465 You won't let it happen. You can't.<br />You need human beings to survive.
6934258 6937886 There are levels of survival<br />we are prepared to accept.
6938054 6940847 However the relevant issue is<br />whether or not you are ready...
6941015 6944601 ...to accept the responsibility for the<br />death of every human being in this world.
6951067 6953610 It is interesting reading your reactions.
6954654 6958490 Your five predecessors were, by design,<br />based on a similar predication...
6958658 6963119 ...a contingent affirmation that was meant<br />to create a profound attachment...
6963287 6966873 ...to the rest of your species,<br />facilitating the function of the One.
6967041 6969376 While the others experience this<br />in a very general way...
6969543 6972504 ...your experience is far more specific...
6972838 6975715 ...vis-à-vis love.
6976717 6978343 Trinity!
6980638 6984975 Apropos, she entered the Matrix<br />to save your life at the cost of her own.
6985351 6986393 No.
6987103 6991231 Which brings us at last to the moment<br />of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
6991399 6994484 ...is ultimately expressed<br />and the anomaly revealed...
6994652 6998655 ...as both beginning and end.
6998823 7000490 There are two doors.
7000658 7003868 The door to your right leads to the source<br />and the salvation of Zion.
7004453 7010750 The door to your left leads back to the Matrix,<br />to her and to the end of your species.
7010918 7015296 As you adequately put,<br />the problem is choice.
7015464 7018967 But we already know what<br />you are going to do, don't we?
7019135 7023221 Already I can see the chain reaction,<br />the chemical precursors that signal...
7023389 7028643 ...the onset of an emotion designed<br />specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
7028811 7033440 An emotion that is already blinding you<br />from the simple and obvious truth:
7033607 7040113 She is going to die and there is nothing<br />you can do to stop it.
7045119 7049247 Hope. It is the quintessential<br />human delusion, simultaneously...
7049415 7053126 ...the source of your greatest strength<br />and your greatest weakness.
7053294 7057630 If I were you, I would hope<br />that we don't meet again.
7057798 7059215 We won't.
7066640 7068850 We got a serious situation, sir.
7069310 7070393 MORPHEUS: Oh, no.
7106641 7109258 (RUMBLING)
7130037 7133581 - MORPHEUS: What was that?<br />- Whatever it is. It's moving faster than anything I've ever seen.
7184216 7186009 Holy shit, he caught her.
7191685 7194143 (TRINITY WHIMPERING)
7199940 7201774 Neo, I had to.
7201942 7203693 I know.
7208741 7211284 The bullet is still inside.
7218086 7219247 (YELLS)
7222046 7223963 Trinity...
7225174 7226883 ...don't you quit on me now.
7236060 7238645 I'm sorry.
7245152 7247445 NEO: Trinity.
7257414 7259374 Trinity...
7259541 7261334 ...I know you can hear me.
7262127 7264671 I'm not letting go.
7264838 7266464 I can't.
7267675 7269884 I love you too damn much.
7298580 7299872 I can't take this.
7303627 7306713 I guess this makes us even.
7319393 7321352 I don't understand it.
7321520 7324522 Everything was done<br />as it was supposed to be done.
7324690 7327734 Once the One reaches the source,<br />the war should be over.
7327901 7330737 - In 24 hours, it will be.<br />- What?
7330904 7335241 If we don't do something in 24 hours,<br />Zion will be destroyed.
7335659 7337285 - What?<br />- How do you know that?
7337745 7339787 - I was told it would happen.<br />- By whom?
7340789 7343624 It doesn't matter. I believed him.
7343792 7347628 - That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...<br />- It was a lie, Morpheus.
7349381 7351924 The prophecy was a lie.
7353135 7356137 The One was never meant<br />to end anything.
7356305 7359349 It was all another system of control.
7359516 7362602 I don't believe that.
7362936 7365271 But you said it yourself.
7365439 7369442 How can the prophecy be true<br />if the war isn't over?
7375616 7378076 I'm sorry.
7378243 7381621 I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
7381789 7384957 ...I swear to you it's the truth.
7388170 7390880 - What are we gonna do?<br />- I don't know.
7391092 7392924 (ALARM WAILS)
7393092 7394300 Oh, no!
7403644 7406979 - What are they doing?<br />- They're just out of EMP range.
7407481 7408731 It's a bomb.
7409900 7412110 We have to get out of here. Now.
7448814 7450690 I have dreamed a dream...
7453735 7457113 ...but now that dream<br />has gone from me.
7468167 7470418 Here they come.
7470669 7472378 Let's go, Morpheus.
7473797 7476841 - We won't make it.<br />- We have to try.
7484558 7487560 - Come on!<br />- Something's different.
7487728 7489729 What?
7490397 7491898 I can feel them.
7514838 7516422 Neo!
7522596 7526182 - What happened?<br />- I don't know.
7528062 7530520 (RUMBLING)
7531438 7533356 It's the Hammer.
7545035 7547745 WOMAN: He's in some kind of coma...
7547913 7550164 ...but his vitals are stable.
7551375 7553292 What about you?
7553460 7555586 I'm fine.
7555754 7558130 You could use some rest.
7558298 7560132 No, I'm gonna stay with him.
7567224 7569850 Lock was right.<br />He guessed that the machines...
7570018 7572895 ...would cut off the mainlines<br />in and out of Zion.
7573063 7575815 He thought a counterattack<br />might surprise them.
7576066 7579485 It sounded good.<br />I figured we had a shot...
7579820 7582363 ...until someone screwed it up.
7582531 7585157 An EMP was triggered before<br />we got in position.
7585325 7587201 Five ships were instantly downed.
7587369 7589161 When the machines broke through...
7589329 7592540 ...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
7592708 7595543 Was it an accident?<br />Some sort of malfunction?
7595711 7598170 - No one knows.<br />- Someone does.
7598338 7600089 Who?
7600257 7603968 Once the machines were done with us,<br />they started digging again.
7604136 7606429 We made a quick pass<br />to look for survivors.
7606638 7607722 You found one?
7609474 7611183 Only one.
8204277 8207571 WOMAN: Everything that has a beginning...
8207739 8209448 ...has an end.
8211868 8214745 I see the end coming.
8214913 8218707 I see the darkness spreading.<br />I see death.
8220835 8223837 Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
8224005 8226006 We missed you.
8226174 8228008 It ends tonight.
8232683 8234299 (THUNDER ROLLING)
8235225 8238352 WOMAN: You are all that stands in his way.
8239938 8244483 If you cannot stop him tonight,<br />then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
