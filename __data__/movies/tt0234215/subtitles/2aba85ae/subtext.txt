87470 89300 See you tomorrow.
108610 109660 Oh, my God!
132310 133850 I'm in.
246960 248710 We're almost there.
248920 252880 - Sir, are you sure about this?<br />- I told you, we're going to be all right.
253050 258470 I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping<br />some serious sentinel activity up here.
296680 299060 - Link.<br />- Yes, sir?
299220 302350 Given your situation, I can't say<br />I understand your reasons...
302520 305190 ...for volunteering to operate<br />onboard my ship.
305350 309360 However, if you wish to continue to<br />do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
309940 311360 What's that, sir?
312150 313400 To trust me.
313570 315530 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
317570 320740 - I mean, I do, sir.<br />- I hope so.
320910 324290 Repatch the main AC to the hard drives<br />and stand by to broadcast.
324500 325540 Yes, sir.
334420 336630 Still can't sleep?
338640 339970 You wanna talk?
342310 344730 They're just dreams.
347020 349400 If you're afraid of something...
349560 351400 I just wish...
352070 354320 I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
354490 356320 That's all.
357240 358860 I just wish I knew.
359030 363240 She's gonna call. Don't worry.
363410 364450 Here you are.
364620 368080 - Are we ready to go?<br />- We're already late.
368290 372880 These geotherms confirm<br />the last transmission of the Osiris.
373630 375300 The machines are digging.
376970 379300 They're boring from the surface<br />down to Zion.
379470 382010 - Mother-<br />- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
382180 383680 How fast are they moving?
383850 387230 Control estimates their descent<br />at 100 meters an hour.
387440 389850 - How deep are they?<br />- Almost 2000 meters.
390020 393570 - What about the scans from the Osiris?<br />- They can't be accurate.
393730 395650 - They may be.<br />- It's not possible.
395820 398280 That'd mean there are<br />a quarter-million sentinels.
398450 399950 - That's right.<br />- That can't be.
400110 401780 Why not?
401950 405750 A sentinel for every man,<br />woman and child in Zion.
406700 410620 That sounds exactly like<br />the thinking of a machine to me.
410830 412960 Morpheus, glad you could join us.
413460 414630 Niobe.
416050 419380 My apologies to all.<br />But as you are undoubtedly aware...
419550 422850 ...it's become difficult to locate<br />a secure broadcast position.
423050 426270 - Squiddies got our best spots.<br />- Lines are crawling with them.
426430 430230 And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours<br />there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
430390 431520 What are we gonna do?
431690 433980 We're gonna do what<br />Commander Lock ordered.
434360 436900 We'll evacuate broadcast level<br />and return to Zion.
437070 442200 And does the commander have a plan<br />for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
442410 445030 A strategy is still being formulated.
445200 446870 I'm sure it is.
461930 463890 What do you think<br />we should do, Morpheus?
464100 466220 - We should proceed as ordered...<br />- What is it?
466390 467430 I don't know.
467600 470390 ...however, I must ask one of you<br />for help.
470560 476270 Some of you believe as I believe, some<br />of you do not. Those of you that do...
476440 479030 ...know we are nearing<br />the end of our struggle.
479190 483410 The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.<br />But before it can be...
483570 486910 ...the Oracle must be consulted.
494830 497090 If we return and recharge now...
497300 501010 ...we can be back in 36 hours, well<br />before the machines reach this depth.
501220 503050 Do you understand what you're asking?
503220 506050 I am asking that one ship<br />remain here in our place...
506220 508930 ...in case the Oracle<br />should attempt to contact us.
509100 512230 Bullshit. You're asking one of us<br />to disobey a direct order.
512390 516940 That's right, I am. But we well know<br />that the reason most of us are here...
517110 519780 ...is because of our affinity<br />for disobedience.
519940 521820 What happens when you<br />get back to Zion...
522030 524410 ...and the commander<br />throws you in the stockade?
524570 525820 He won't.
526950 530120 Goddamn it, Morpheus,<br />you ain't never gonna change.
530830 533580 Shit, I'll do it just to see<br />what Deadbolt does to you.
533750 535290 You got 36 hours.
538130 539920 I'm looking for Neo.
540130 543470 - Never heard of him.<br />- I have something for him.
544680 546890 A gift.
547090 549970 You see, he set me free.
552310 554640 Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
555190 558230 - Who was that?<br />- How did you know someone was here?
558440 559860 He gave you this.
565660 567030 He said you set him free.
568990 571330 Is everything all right, sir?
571950 574330 The meeting is over.<br />Retreat to your exits.
574500 576750 - Agents are coming.<br />- Agents?
577170 578540 Go.
588340 589430 Hiya, fellas.
589600 590720 - It's him.<br />- The anomaly.
590890 592140 - Do we proceed?<br />- Yes.
592310 594810 - He is still-<br />- Only human.
601690 603280 Upgrades.
658210 660710 - That went as expected.<br />- Yes.
660880 663590 It's happening exactly as before.
663710 666420 Well, not exactly.
670090 672220 - What happened?<br />- I can't figure it out.
672390 674060 Agents just came out of nowhere.
674220 677220 Then the code got all weird.<br />Encryption I've never seen.
677390 680310 - Is Neo okay?<br />- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
680480 681900 Where is he now?
683360 685110 He's doing his Superman thing.
735070 736530 Where are you?
741210 744830 This is the Nebuchadnezzar,<br />requesting access through Gate Three.
748880 753300 Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.<br />Maintain present velocity and stand by.
753470 755010 Roger that, Control.
755180 758640 This is Control requesting immediate<br />stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
759430 762640 We have the Nebuchadnezzar<br />on approach. Let's open her up.
768270 771150 You are cleared through<br />Gate Three to Bay Seven.
771360 773030 Roger that, Control.
780160 783250 Door's open, bed's made.<br />Welcome home.
784000 786170 No place like it.
800350 804060 Roger that, Control. Zion Control,<br />stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
853570 855990 The Nebuchadnezzar is down.<br />Bay Seven.
856150 857320 Understood.
867290 868580 Captain Mifune.
869670 870840 Captain Morpheus.
871040 873840 Are you here to escort me<br />to the stockade, captain?
874010 877430 - I'm just here to keep the peace.<br />- Commander Lock demands-
878680 881850 Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
882760 884600 - Link.<br />- Sir?
884770 887350 I want the ship ready to go<br />as soon as possible.
887560 889060 Understood, sir.
896240 898650 - What is it between them?<br />- Morpheus and Lock?
899820 901950 - Niobe.<br />- Captain Niobe?
902120 905330 She used to be with Morpheus.<br />Now she's with Lock.
906620 908160 What happened?
908370 911830 Morpheus went to the Oracle.<br />After that, everything changed.
912000 914630 Yeah, she can do that.
914840 915960 Neo!
917010 919880 - Oh, no.<br />- How does he always know?
920050 922010 Doesn't he have anything better to do?
922180 924850 You know what they say<br />about the life you save.
925060 926810 I didn't save his life.
928980 930350 Hiya, Neo.
931520 934190 - Trinity, Link.<br />- Hey.
934360 937990 - It's great to have you back.<br />- Thanks. It's good to be back.
938150 940910 - Can I carry that for you?<br />- No, I can carry my own bag.
941070 942740 - Trinity?<br />- I'm fine.
943700 946580 - You can carry these.<br />- Yeah, sure, Link.
951540 956000 Hey, you know, next year<br />I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
956170 958920 I've been thinking about it,<br />and I've made my decision.
959090 960590 Let me guess.
961050 963010 I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
964010 967560 Morpheus hasn't filled the other<br />positions, except for you, Link.
967770 969100 I'm sure he has reasons...
969270 972600 ...but the more I think about it,<br />the more I think it's meant to be.
972770 974310 You know, it's fate.
974480 976070 You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
976190 978730 I told you, you found me.<br />I didn't find you.
978940 981450 I know, but you got me out.<br />You saved me.
982570 984240 You saved yourself.
1000550 1003800 - Morpheus.<br />- Commander Lock.
1004050 1008560 I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to<br />offer you a chance to explain your actions.
1008760 1011640 I wasn't aware that my actions<br />required any explanation.
1011810 1014060 You were given an order<br />to return to Zion.
1014230 1017060 - I did.<br />- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
1017230 1019940 I would have stayed,<br />but I needed to recharge my ship.
1020070 1022820 So you admit to a direct contravention<br />of your duty.
1022990 1026370 We need a presence inside the Matrix<br />to await contact from the Oracle.
1026530 1028490 I don't want to hear that shit!
1028660 1031330 I don't care about oracles<br />or prophecies or messiahs!
1031500 1034960 I care about one thing: Stopping that army<br />from destroying this city.
1035120 1037920 To do that I need soldiers<br />to obey my orders.
1038130 1042670 With all due respect, commander,<br />there is only one way to save our city.
1042840 1044260 How?
1044430 1047260 - Neo.<br />- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
1047430 1050010 Not everyone believes what you believe.
1050220 1052310 My beliefs do not require them to.
1060480 1064360 There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's<br />talking. A lot of people are scared.
1064570 1067280 No one remembers the last time<br />so many ships were docked.
1067450 1070410 - Something big is happening, isn't it?<br />- Hey.
1070620 1073790 We're not allowed to say anything,<br />so stop asking.
1079040 1082170 Goddamn, it's good to be home.
1095230 1098190 I'm recommending that you<br />be removed from duty.
1098350 1100650 That is, of course,<br />your prerogative, commander.
1100820 1104690 If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot<br />on a ship for the rest of your life.
1104860 1108160 Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.
1114080 1116500 - Councillor Hamann.<br />- Commander.
1117160 1119880 - Captain.<br />- Councillor.
1120040 1123420 Council's asked me to speak tonight<br />at the temple gathering.
1123630 1127720 The presence of the fleet and the<br />persistence of rumors must be addressed.
1127880 1130340 The people must be told<br />what is happening.
1130510 1132220 Of course, councillor.
1132970 1138190 But might I advise a level of discretion<br />concerning specific details.
1138350 1141360 - We do not wish to start a panic.<br />- Quite right.
1141520 1144610 A panic is not what anyone wants.
1144780 1148150 What about you, captain?<br />What would you advise?
1150530 1155290 The truth. No one will panic,<br />because there is nothing to fear.
1155450 1157580 That army won't reach<br />the gates of Zion.
1158410 1161960 - What makes you so sure?<br />- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
1162130 1164000 Consider that in the past six months...
1164170 1166210 ...we have freed more minds<br />than in six years.
1166420 1169430 This attack is an act of desperation.
1169590 1173430 I believe very soon the prophecy<br />will be fulfilled and this war will end.
1175260 1177390 I hope you're right, captain.
1177600 1180270 I do not believe it to be<br />a matter of hope, councillor.
1180440 1183020 It is simply a matter of time.
1185190 1186690 My stop.
1186860 1188240 See you soon.
1188400 1189900 Hopefully not too soon.
1190030 1193200 Let's go, kid.<br />These two got things to do.
1202630 1204380 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1204540 1207000 I am if you're thinking<br />this elevator is too slow.
1207170 1210470 - How long do we charge the Neb?<br />- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
1210630 1214850 Some people go their entire lives<br />without hearing news that good.
1239290 1243620 Neo, please, I have a son,<br />Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
1243830 1247300 - Please, watch over him.<br />- I'll try.
1247460 1249550 I have a daughter on the Icarus.
1250340 1251630 No, wait.
1251840 1254300 It's all right. They need you.
1254470 1256720 - I need you.<br />- I know.
1257260 1259560 There's time.
1264520 1266650 Where's my puss-?
1266810 1269190 - Hey!<br />- Uncle Link!
1269360 1270940 God!
1271150 1273070 Uncle Link!
1273280 1276820 Oh, my God! You're so huge!
1276990 1279160 - You should be picking me up!<br />- No!
1279370 1280870 - Yeah!<br />- Okay!
1281040 1282750 Okay? All right.
1282910 1285960 Now, we're gonna have<br />to work together here, okay?
1286130 1288340 One, two, three, lift!
1288540 1291710 Oh, my God!<br />What are you feeding these two?
1291840 1294590 Come on, kids. It's time to go.
1296340 1297720 - Hey, Cas.<br />- Hey.
1298220 1300810 - Good to have you home, Link.<br />- Good to be home.
1300970 1302810 You be careful with her.
1302980 1305730 Don't worry about me.<br />He's the one that's gonna get it.
1307560 1309980 Out the door! Both of you, march!
1310150 1312150 - Bye!<br />- Bye!
1318530 1320120 I'm gonna get what?
1321370 1325460 Every ship up there's been home two, even<br />three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
1325620 1329460 Come on, Zee.<br />I thought we were past this.
1329630 1333050 - We'll be when you operate another ship.<br />- I can't do that.
1333210 1334720 - Why?<br />- You know why.
1334880 1338050 If Dozer knew how I felt,<br />he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
1338760 1341310 Maybe. But it's too late now.
1341510 1344100 I made a promise,<br />and some promises can't be unmade.
1344270 1346980 - It's not fair.<br />- Nobody said it was gonna be.
1347140 1350110 You think Cas thinks it's fair<br />that I'm here and Dozer's not?
1356030 1359240 I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
1360320 1362540 I'm afraid of it.
1364160 1366750 I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
1367420 1369250 It won't.
1369420 1371250 How can you say that to me?
1371420 1373380 Because of Morpheus.
1373550 1378220 Because of what he's told me. He said<br />that this is it, that it will be over soon.
1378380 1382560 - Link, Morpheus is crazy.<br />- No doubt.
1383060 1386310 But Tank and Dozer believed him.<br />And I'll tell you what...
1386480 1391770 ...after being on that ship and seeing Neo<br />do the things he can do, I gotta say...
1391940 1393980 ...I'm starting to believe him too.
1399110 1401530 Be careful, Link.
1406910 1409250 Please be careful.
1418340 1421760 - They started yet?<br />- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
1421970 1425060 Tonight, let us honor<br />these men and women.
1425220 1427810 These are our soldiers, our warriors.
1428020 1432230 These are our husbands and wives,<br />our brothers and sisters...
1432400 1434110 ...our children.
1434650 1437780 Let us remember those<br />that have been lost...
1437940 1441160 ...and let us give thanks<br />for those that have been found...
1441360 1444620 ...and who stand here beside us.
1444830 1448540 Now I would like someone else<br />to close this prayer...
1448660 1451870 ...someone who hasn't spoken here<br />in a long time...
1452040 1457420 ...but who I believe has something to say<br />that we all need to hear.
1458420 1460010 I give you Morpheus.
1479530 1483700 Zion! Hear me!
1484700 1487830 It is true what many of you have heard.
1487990 1492000 The machines have gathered<br />an army, and as I speak...
1492210 1496090 ...that army is drawing nearer<br />to our home.
1497550 1502220 Believe me when I say we have<br />a difficult time ahead of us.
1502880 1507060 But if we are to be prepared for it,<br />we must first shed our fear of it.
1509600 1514480 I stand here before you now<br />truthfully unafraid.
1515060 1516810 Why?
1517230 1520070 Because I believe something you do not?
1520230 1522070 No!
1522360 1527330 I stand here without fear<br />because I remember.
1527490 1531410 I remember that I am here not because<br />of the path that lies before me...
1531580 1534960 ...but because of the path<br />that lies behind me.
1535120 1539750 I remember that for 100 years<br />we have fought these machines.
1539920 1544680 I remember that for 100 years<br />they have sent their armies to destroy us.
1544840 1549930 And after a century of war,<br />I remember that which matters most:
1551810 1554810 We are still here!
1561570 1563610 Tonight...
1563780 1567160 ...let us send a message to that army.
1567320 1570370 Tonight, let us shake this cave.
1570580 1574410 Tonight, let us tremble these halls...
1574620 1577750 ...of earth, steel and stone.
1577920 1583130 Let us be heard from red core<br />to black sky.
1583300 1587890 Tonight, let us make them remember:
1588050 1593020 This is Zion and we are not afraid!
1616370 1618330 I remember.
1619170 1621590 I remember you used to dance.
1623210 1626510 I remember you were pretty good.
1627260 1630510 There are some things in this world,<br />Captain Niobe...
1631300 1634100 ...that will never change.
1635390 1637310 Niobe!
1642060 1643770 Some things do change.
1663040 1664880 Excuse me.
1676770 1680230 - I missed you.<br />- I can tell.
1680730 1684400 I was thinking, everyone is here.
1684940 1687230 Follow me.
1888270 1891810 Neo, what is it?
1892110 1894400 What's wrong?
1895940 1898280 It's okay, you can tell me.
1898700 1901160 Trinity...
1901320 1904120 Don't be afraid.
1904290 1906620 I can't lose you.
1906830 1908710 You're not gonna lose me.
1912840 1915670 You feel this?
1915880 1917630 I'm never letting go.
1954840 1957550 Good night, Zion.
1957710 1960340 Sweet dreams.
1970520 1972190 - You all right?<br />- I'll make it.
1972350 1974980 Did you see that agent?<br />I've never seen anything like that.
1975150 1977230 It doesn't matter.<br />All that matters is this.
1977400 1979690 You first.
1990580 1993460 - Oh, God.<br />- "Smith" will suffice.
2005430 2009270 - Thank you.<br />- My pleasure.
2058650 2061940 - Care for some company?<br />- Councillor Hamann.
2062820 2065700 I don't want to intrude<br />if you'd prefer to be alone.
2066110 2069660 - No, I could probably use some company.<br />- Good.
2070120 2072540 So could I.
2075670 2078130 It's nice tonight.
2078670 2081050 Very calm.
2081210 2084010 It feels like everyone is sleeping<br />very peacefully.
2084340 2086840 Not everyone.
2087130 2091810 I hate sleeping.<br />I never sleep more than a few hours.
2092010 2096060 I figure I slept the first 11 years<br />of my life, now I'm making up for it.
2096480 2101230 - What about you?<br />- I just haven't been able to sleep much.
2102650 2105820 - It's a good sign.<br />- Of what?
2105990 2109160 That you are in fact still human.
2112740 2116660 Have you ever been<br />to the engineering level?
2116830 2119880 I love to walk there at night.<br />It's quite amazing.
2120040 2122630 - Would you like to see it?<br />- Sure.
2133260 2137770 Almost no one comes down here.<br />Unless, of course, there's a problem.
2137940 2142980 That's how it is with people. Nobody<br />cares how it works as long as it works.
2143150 2145440 I like it down here.
2145610 2151410 I like to be reminded this city survives<br />because of these machines.
2151570 2156700 These machines are keeping us alive while<br />other machines are coming to kill us.
2157160 2161960 Interesting, isn't it?<br />The power to give life...
2162170 2165340 - ... and the power to end it.<br />- We have the same power.
2165500 2168220 Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
2168420 2171840 ...sometimes I think about those people<br />still plugged into the Matrix.
2172010 2175010 And when I look at these machines...
2175180 2180270 ...I can't help thinking that, in a way,<br />we are plugged into them.
2180600 2183440 But we control these machines,<br />they don't control us.
2183860 2186860 Of course not. How could they?
2187030 2189570 The idea is pure nonsense...
2190070 2193200 ...but it does make one wonder just...
2193370 2194950 ...what is control?
2195200 2198250 If we wanted, we could<br />shut these machines down.
2198620 2203130 Of course. That's it. You hit it.<br />That's control, isn't it?
2203710 2207090 If we wanted,<br />we could smash them to bits.
2207340 2211470 Although if we did, we'd have to consider<br />what would happen to our lights...
2211630 2214350 ...our heat, our air.
2215350 2219480 So we need machines and they need us.<br />Is that your point, councillor?
2219600 2222270 No. No point.
2222940 2227020 Old men like me don't bother<br />with making points. There's no point.
2227820 2231610 Is that why there are no young men<br />on the Council?
2231780 2233490 Good point.
2234160 2238330 Why don't you tell me<br />what's on your mind, councillor.
2238540 2241790 There is so much in this world...
2241910 2244880 ...that I do not understand.
2246630 2251380 See that machine? It has something to do<br />with recycling our water supply.
2251550 2254550 I have absolutely no idea how it works.
2254720 2258810 But I do understand the reason<br />for it to work.
2260310 2264810 I have absolutely no idea how you<br />are able to do some of the things you do.
2265980 2269190 But I believe there's a reason for that<br />as well.
2270030 2275200 I only hope we understand that reason<br />before it's too late.
2281660 2283370 - Ballard.<br />- Is he here?
2285750 2288340 Neo, it's from the Oracle.
2291300 2293010 It's time to go.
2293970 2296430 Morpheus said this was how<br />it was gonna happen.
2296640 2301020 I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,<br />maybe it's not.
2301560 2304770 All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
2306310 2308190 Right now, that operator's me.
2308860 2310900 I know.
2315860 2317530 - Zee...<br />- I want you to wear it.
2317700 2320790 - You know I don't believe in this stuff.<br />- But I do.
2321120 2324080 It's always brought me luck.
2324250 2328380 - Maybe it'll bring me you.<br />- I'm coming back.
2328500 2333050 I promise. No matter what it takes,<br />I'm coming home.
2333760 2337390 Just keep it with you. Please.
2337590 2339640 For me.
2342060 2344350 Okay.
2363870 2366000 - Neo!<br />- How the hell-?
2366410 2368580 Bane.
2368750 2370080 Is something wrong?
2370250 2372000 No, I'm fine.
2372170 2374920 I just wanted to catch you to say...
2375130 2376920 ...good luck.
2378590 2380340 Thanks.
2380470 2382890 We'll see you.
2384470 2387560 Neo! Just in time.
2387730 2390060 - You're gonna see the Oracle?<br />- There's no time.
2390270 2391860 I had to give something to Neo.
2392610 2395280 A gift from one of the orphans.
2395480 2398860 He made me swear to get it to you<br />before you left.
2399740 2402200 He said you'd understand.
2404870 2407000 Thanks.
2414090 2417010 I was just told you cleared<br />the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
2417170 2419130 That is correct.
2419300 2421260 Am I still in charge<br />of our defense system?
2421430 2422720 Of course.
2423430 2427480 I believe I need every ship we have<br />if we're going to survive this attack.
2428100 2430230 I understand that, commander.
2430390 2432980 Then why did you allow<br />the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
2433190 2438030 Because I believe our survival depends<br />on more than how many ships we have.
2440530 2442820 Be careful.
2471890 2474060 Hello.
2484370 2487910 - You seek the Oracle.<br />- Who are you?
2490960 2495460 I am Seraph. I can take you to her,<br />but first I must apologize.
2495710 2497420 Apologize for what?
2498090 2499880 For this.
2557190 2559440 Good.
2561940 2565110 The Oracle has many enemies.<br />I had to be sure.
2565280 2567530 - Of what?<br />- That you are the One.
2567950 2571700 - You could have just asked.<br />- No. You do not truly know someone...
2571870 2574120 ...until you fight them.
2574710 2578130 Come. She's waiting.
2593180 2595100 Where the hell did they go?
2595430 2598150 These are back doors, aren't they?
2598310 2601270 Programmer access.
2602360 2606070 - How do they work?<br />- A code is hidden in tumblers.
2606280 2611280 One position opens a lock and another<br />position opens one of these doors.
2612990 2615830 Are you a programmer?
2616000 2618370 Then what are you?
2620540 2624010 I protect that which matters most.
2643520 2646940 Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
2647320 2650110 Come around here<br />and let me have a look at you.
2653330 2655700 My goodness, look at you.
2656080 2658870 You turned out all right, didn't you?
2659080 2661290 - How do you feel?<br />- I-
2661420 2665000 I know you're not sleeping.<br />We'll get to that.
2665210 2667880 Why don't you come<br />and have a sit this time.
2668590 2672720 - Maybe I'll stand.<br />- Well, suit yourself.
2683860 2686400 - I felt like sitting.<br />- I know.
2687610 2689490 So...
2691570 2693990 ...let's get the obvious stuff<br />out of the way.
2694280 2698790 - You're not human, are you?<br />- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
2698960 2704750 If I had to guess, I'd say you're<br />a program from the machine world.
2705170 2709340 - So is he.<br />- So far, so good.
2709510 2712680 But if that's true, that could mean<br />you're part of this system...
2712840 2715430 ...another kind of control.
2715600 2720100 - Keep going.<br />- I suppose the most obvious question is...
2720310 2724190 - ... how can I trust you?<br />- Bingo.
2725270 2728530 It is a pickle, no doubt about it.<br />Bad news is...
2728650 2732320 ...there's no way you can really know<br />if I'm here to help you or not.
2732530 2736030 So it's really up to you. Just have<br />to make up your own damn mind...
2736200 2741000 ...to either accept what<br />I'm going to tell you or reject it.
2742290 2744460 Candy?
2747170 2751590 - Do you already know if I'll take it?<br />- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
2751800 2754970 But if you already know,<br />how can I make a choice?
2755140 2759180 Because you didn't come here to make<br />the choice. You've already made it.
2759350 2764020 You're here to try to understand<br />why you made it.
2769530 2772490 I thought you'd have figured that out<br />by now.
2774280 2776820 - Why are you here?<br />- Same reason.
2777070 2779830 I love candy.
2779990 2782830 But why help us?
2783000 2786540 We're all here to do<br />what we're all here to do.
2787040 2790130 I'm interested in one thing, Neo:<br />the future.
2790300 2794550 And believe me, I know, the only way<br />to get there is together.
2795340 2800260 - Are there other programs like you?<br />- Well, not like me, but...
2800430 2803100 Look. See those birds?
2803350 2806770 At some point, a program was written<br />to govern them.
2806940 2812740 A program was written to watch over the<br />trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
2813030 2815910 There are programs running<br />all over the place.
2816070 2820490 The ones doing their job, doing what<br />they were meant to do, are invisible.
2820660 2824500 You'd never even know they were here.<br />But the other ones...
2824660 2828750 Well, you hear about them all the time.
2829380 2832250 - I've never heard of them.<br />- Of course you have.
2832420 2837340 Every time you've heard someone<br />say they saw a ghost or an angel...
2837510 2842060 ...every story you've ever heard about<br />vampires, werewolves or aliens...
2842220 2844560 ...is the system assimilating<br />some program...
2844730 2849400 ...that's doing something<br />they're not supposed to be doing.
2849610 2852610 Programs hacking programs.
2852780 2855650 - Why?<br />- They have their reasons...
2855820 2859740 ...but usually a program chooses exile<br />when it faces deletion.
2860160 2864080 - And why would a program be deleted?<br />- Maybe it breaks down.
2864250 2868830 Maybe a better program is created<br />to replace it. Happens all the time.
2869000 2873960 And when it does, a program<br />can either choose to hide here...
2874130 2876760 ...or return to the source.
2878430 2881720 - The machine mainframe.<br />- Yes.
2881890 2884390 Where you must go.
2884560 2888770 Where the path of the One ends.<br />You've seen it...
2889940 2892770 ...in your dreams, haven't you?
2892940 2895780 A door made of light?
2898030 2901570 What happens when you go through<br />the door?
2903740 2906750 I see Trinity...
2906870 2910040 ...and something happens...
2910210 2912130 ...something bad.
2912290 2916300 She starts to fall,<br />and then I wake up.
2917340 2921220 - Do you see her die?<br />- No.
2922050 2925060 You have the sight now, Neo.
2925220 2928230 You are looking at the world<br />without time.
2928390 2930810 Then why can't I see<br />what happens to her?
2931020 2934730 We can never see past the choices<br />we don't understand.
2934900 2938110 Are you saying I have to choose<br />whether Trinity lives or dies?
2938360 2942160 No, you've already made the choice.
2942320 2944830 Now you have to understand it.
2945490 2946830 No.
2946990 2950250 I can't do that. I won't.
2950960 2953380 - Well, you have to.<br />- Why?
2953920 2957000 Because you're the One.
2959170 2962180 What if I can't?
2962340 2964350 What happens if I fail?
2964930 2967930 Then Zion will fall.
2975400 2980280 Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.<br />You can save Zion...
2980440 2983740 ...if you reach the source, but to do that<br />you need the Keymaker.
2983950 2984950 The Keymaker?
2985160 2988740 He disappeared. We didn't<br />know what happened to him until now.
2988910 2992670 He's being held prisoner<br />by a very dangerous program...
2992830 2996380 ...one of the oldest of us.<br />He is called the Merovingian.
2996540 2999420 - And he won't let him go willingly.<br />- What does he want?
2999590 3004430 What do all men with power want?<br />More power.
3005140 3008430 Be there at that exact time...
3008600 3011230 ...and you will have a chance.
3012020 3014270 We must go.
3014480 3019820 Seems like every time we meet<br />I got nothing but bad news.
3020400 3023280 I'm sorry about that. I surely am.
3023450 3026200 But for what it's worth...
3027240 3030910 ...you've made a believer out of me.
3032200 3034330 Good luck, kiddo.
3054270 3057270 Mr. Anderson.
3058310 3060320 Did you get my package?
3060480 3062610 - Yeah.<br />- Well, good.
3063780 3066660 - Smith?<br />- He's not reading like an agent.
3066820 3070700 - Surprised to see me?<br />- No.
3070990 3073450 - Then you're aware of it.<br />- Of what?
3074710 3076670 Our connection.
3076870 3079500 I don't fully understand how it happened.
3079710 3083050 Perhaps some part of you<br />imprinted onto me...
3083210 3085930 ...something overwritten or copied.
3086050 3088800 It is, at this point, irrelevant.<br />What matters is...
3088970 3092060 ...that whatever happened,<br />happened for a reason.
3092180 3093890 And what reason is that?
3094310 3098270 I killed you, Mr. Anderson.<br />I watched you die.
3098440 3101690 With a certain satisfaction,<br />I might add.
3101860 3105360 And then something happened,<br />something that I knew was impossible...
3105530 3107360 ...but it happened anyway.
3108070 3111280 You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
3113290 3117830 Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood<br />what I was supposed to do...
3118000 3121000 ...but I didn't.
3121460 3125340 I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...
3125800 3129340 ...compelled to disobey.
3129930 3133720 And now, here I stand<br />because of you, Mr. Anderson.
3133890 3137810 Because of you, I'm no longer an agent<br />of this system.
3137980 3141190 Because of you, I've changed.<br />I'm unplugged.
3141360 3146190 A new man, so to speak.<br />Like you, apparently free.
3146530 3147950 Congratulations.
3148650 3150990 Thank you.
3151570 3156250 But as you well know,<br />appearances can be deceiving...
3156370 3161540 ...which brings me back to the reason<br />why we're here.
3161710 3166590 We're not here because we're free.<br />We're here because we are not free.
3166760 3170680 There's no escaping reason,<br />no denying purpose.
3170840 3174220 Because as we both know,<br />without purpose...
3174430 3179230 - ... we would not exist.<br />- It is purpose that created us.
3179440 3182400 - Purpose that connects us.<br />- Purpose that pulls us.
3182610 3184400 - That guides us.<br />- That drives us.
3184610 3189280 - It is purpose that defines.<br />- Purpose that binds us.
3189450 3191910 We are here because of you,<br />Mr. Anderson.
3192070 3196450 We're here to take from you<br />what you tried to take from us:
3198410 3200500 Purpose.
3203580 3205460 - What's happening to him?<br />- Don't know.
3208510 3212130 Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
3318990 3321410 - You.<br />- Yes, me.
3325580 3328460 Me, me, me.
3333380 3335010 Me too.
3462800 3463800 More.
3526070 3528950 It is inevitable.
3529330 3530790 Come on, get out of there.
3573960 3576290 Are you all right?
3577380 3579290 - It was Smith.<br />- Yes.
3580170 3582800 - Now there's more than one of them?<br />- A lot more.
3582960 3586760 - How is that possible?<br />- I don't know.
3586970 3589390 Somehow, he's found a way<br />to copy himself.
3589550 3593770 - Is that what he was doing to you?<br />- I don't know what he was doing...
3593980 3596690 - ... but I know what it felt like.<br />- What?
3597600 3601320 It felt like I was back in that hallway.
3601480 3602900 It felt like dying.
3603400 3606280 The machines are tunneling to avoid<br />our defense system.
3606450 3610320 But I believe they will intersect<br />certain pipelines to control them.
3610450 3612990 These points of intersection<br />are crucial...
3613200 3615960 ...because I believe they're<br />vulnerable to counterattack.
3616120 3620170 Although it has been suggested that<br />this is the same kind of attack...
3620380 3624010 ...we've defended for years,<br />I urge the Council to realize the truth.
3624170 3627550 This is the single greatest threat<br />we have ever faced...
3627720 3631550 ...and if we do not act accordingly,<br />we will not survive.
3631720 3635730 Commander Lock, the Council is well<br />aware of the seriousness of this attack.
3635980 3640520 You have our leave to prepare our defense<br />by any and all means necessary.
3640730 3643360 - Thank you, Council.<br />- However...
3643610 3646990 ...we ask if there's been word<br />from the Nebuchadnezzar.
3647190 3649700 No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
3651320 3655290 Then we request a ship be dispatched<br />to ascertain the fate of the One.
3655450 3659210 I wish that were possible, councillor,<br />but I do not believe our defense...
3659370 3662920 - ... can suffer the loss of another ship.<br />- It will, commander, if it must.
3663130 3665420 It could take one ship days<br />to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
3665590 3668630 - Then send two.<br />- This is insane.
3668800 3671800 Careful, commander.
3672010 3675390 Forgive my frustration, councillors.
3675560 3679440 But I wish I were able to comprehend<br />the Council's choice in this matter.
3679600 3682730 Comprehension is not<br />a requisite of cooperation.
3682900 3685360 If you are asking me<br />to order two of my captains-
3685570 3687230 There's no need for such an order.
3687400 3690950 The captains are present.<br />They can answer for themselves.
3691410 3696700 The Council is calling for two volunteers<br />to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
3696870 3701000 Are there two among you<br />that would answer such a call?
3702290 3706090 Captain Soren of the Vigilant<br />will answer the Council's call.
3706250 3709170 You understand the situation,<br />Captain Soren?
3709340 3711800 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Thank you, captain.
3713260 3714640 Is there another?
3715430 3719140 - Captain, I think we should volunteer.<br />- What? You have gone crazy.
3719350 3721230 - Listen-<br />- Shut your hole, Bane...
3721390 3722850 ...before I put you in one.
3732700 3734490 Is there no other?
3735200 3737120 Be hard for any man to risk his life...
3737290 3740250 ...especially if he doesn't<br />understand the reason.
3740750 3744210 Captain Niobe of the Logos<br />will answer the councillor's call.
3744380 3746670 - What?<br />- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
3746880 3751920 Commander Lock, you have your orders.<br />This Council is hereby adjourned.
3756640 3759220 - Niobe, what are you doing?<br />- What I can.
3759390 3760430 Why?
3761730 3765020 Because some things<br />never change, Jason...
3765190 3767480 ...and some things do.
3783910 3785370 What can you see, Neo?
3785540 3787840 It's strange.<br />The code is somehow different.
3788000 3789590 - Encrypted?<br />- Maybe.
3789750 3791710 Is that good for us or bad for us?
3792470 3795590 Well, it looks like every floor<br />is wired with explosives.
3796180 3797760 Bad for us.
3798140 3799680 Here we go.
3807690 3810570 Yes. We are here to speak<br />with the Merovingian.
3811070 3814900 Well, of course.<br />He has been expecting you.
3815070 3816070 Follow me.
3838050 3843930 Here he is at last.<br />Neo, the One himself.
3844100 3845520 Right?
3845690 3848020 And the legendary Morpheus.
3848850 3853730 And Trinity, of course.<br />I have heard so much.
3853900 3857360 You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.<br />This is my wife, Persephone.
3858280 3861580 Something to eat? Drink?
3861910 3864910 Of course, such things are contrivances,<br />like so much here.
3865080 3867580 For the sake of appearances.
3867790 3871210 - No, thank you.<br />- Yes, of course. Who has time?
3871380 3876470 Who has time? But then, if we do not ever<br />take time, how can we ever have time?
3880220 3883560 Ch�teau Haut-Briond, 1959.<br />Magnificent wine.
3883720 3886640 I love French wine<br />like I love the French language.
3886810 3890980 I have sampled every language. French<br />is my favorite. Fantastic language...
3891190 3893320 ...especially to curse with.
3897320 3901820 You see? It's like wiping your ass<br />with silk. I love it.
3903490 3905200 You know why we are here.
3906950 3911830 I am a trafficker of information.<br />I know everything I can.
3912250 3918090 The question is,<br />do you know why you are here?
3918380 3920890 We are looking for the Keymaker.
3921510 3926020 Oh, yes, it is true.<br />The Keymaker, of course.
3926180 3929140 But this is not a reason,<br />this is not a why.
3929310 3933110 The Keymaker himself, his very nature,<br />is a means, it is not an end.
3933230 3938990 And so to look for him is to be<br />looking for a means to do...
3939200 3942320 - ... what?<br />- You know the answer to that question.
3942490 3944620 But do you?
3944830 3947200 You think you do, but you do not.
3947370 3950540 You are here<br />because you were sent here.
3950710 3953830 You were told to come here,<br />and then you obeyed.
3955000 3957380 It is, of course, the way of all things.
3957550 3960170 You see, there is only one constant...
3960340 3964550 ...one universal. It is the only real truth.
3964720 3966350 Causality.
3966560 3968810 Action, reaction.
3968980 3973190 - Cause and effect.<br />- Everything begins with choice.
3973350 3975110 No. Wrong.
3975270 3979860 Choice is an illusion created<br />between those with power...
3980070 3982110 ...and those without.
3983660 3986830 Look there at that woman.
3987540 3991460 My God, just look at her...
3991710 3994380 ...affecting everyone around her.
3994540 3999300 So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.<br />But wait.
3999550 4003340 Watch. You see, I have sent her<br />a dessert...
4003510 4007720 ...a very special dessert.
4012060 4014560 I wrote it myself.
4014690 4017900 It starts so simply...
4018070 4022650 ...each line of the program creating<br />a new effect, just like...
4023740 4025320 ...poetry.
4025490 4026910 First...
4027410 4032870 ...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
4033410 4036040 You can see it, Neo, yes?
4036670 4039250 She does not understand why.
4039500 4041920 Is it the wine? No.
4042130 4044470 What is it then? What is the reason?
4045130 4047430 And soon it does not matter.
4047600 4050600 Soon the why and the reason are gone...
4051560 4057100 ...and all that matters is the<br />feeling itself.
4057560 4060650 And this is the nature of the universe.
4060820 4063400 We struggle against it,<br />we fight to deny it...
4063570 4066110 ...but it is, of course, pretense.<br />It is a lie.
4066280 4070280 Beneath our poised appearance...
4070490 4075750 ...the truth is, we are completely...
4078670 4081500 ...out of control.
4086880 4091720 Causality. There is no escape from it.<br />We are forever slaves to it.
4092140 4097600 Our only hope, our only peace, is<br />to understand it, to understand the why.
4097770 4101190 "Why" is what separates us from them...
4101360 4103650 ...you from me.
4103820 4107570 "Why" is the only real source of power.<br />Without it, you are powerless.
4107740 4111030 And this is how you come to me,<br />without why, without power.
4111240 4114000 Another link in the chain.
4114250 4115500 But fear not.
4115660 4119540 Since I have seen how good you are<br />at following orders...
4119710 4122380 ...I will tell you what to do next.
4122840 4127680 Run back and give the fortuneteller<br />this message:
4127880 4132140 Her time is almost up.
4133180 4136730 Now I have some real business to do,<br />so I will say adieu and goodbye.
4136890 4139400 - This isn't over.<br />- Oh, yes, it is.
4139560 4144940 The Keymaker is mine, and I see no<br />reason why I should give him up.
4146110 4150160 - No reason at all.<br />- Where are you going?
4150320 4155080 Please, ma ch�rie, I have told you.<br />We are all victims of causality.
4155240 4158540 I drank too much wine,<br />I must take a piss.
4159080 4162170 Cause and effect. Au revoir.
4167260 4170340 Touch me and that hand<br />will never touch anything again.
4179190 4180690 Well, that didn't go so well.
4180850 4183230 Are you certain the Oracle<br />didn't say anything else?
4183440 4185570 - Yes.<br />- Maybe we did something wrong.
4186190 4187570 Or didn't do something.
4187740 4190950 No, what happened couldn't have<br />happened any other way.
4191110 4194910 - How do you know?<br />- We are still alive.
4197160 4200410 If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
