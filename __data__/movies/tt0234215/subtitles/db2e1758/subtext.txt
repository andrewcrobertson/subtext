3000 5090 Get out.
7010 12350 I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.<br />On and on. Pompous prick.
13930 19430 A long time ago, when we first<br />came here, it was so different.
21190 23940 He was so different.
25690 28320 He was like you.
31070 34830 I'll give you what you want,<br />but you have to give me something.
35580 37870 - What?<br />- A kiss.
38290 39370 Excuse me?
40870 44790 I want you to kiss me<br />as if you were kissing her.
46710 50340 - Why?<br />- You love her. She loves you.
50590 52550 It's all over you both.
53180 57720 A long time ago,<br />I knew what that felt like.
59060 64810 I want to remember it.<br />I want to sample it. That's all.
65060 66900 Just a sample.
67070 70070 - Why don't you sample this instead?<br />- Trinity.
72280 77240 Such emotion over something so small.<br />It's just a kiss.
77410 79580 Why should we trust you?
79750 83750 If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,<br />she can kill me.
90840 92970 All right.
93300 97140 But you have to make me believe<br />I am her.
98350 100390 All right.
106690 108520 Terrible. Forget it.
111530 112950 Wait.
113860 115450 Okay.
152480 154570 Yes.
155200 157660 That's it.
172460 177840 I envy you. But such a thing<br />is not meant to last.
180890 182220 Come with me.
213340 215050 Not again.
218510 221090 It's all right, boys. They're with me.
221760 224140 These fellas work for my husband.
224310 228140 They do his dirty work.<br />They're very good, very loyal.
228310 229850 Aren't you, boys?
230020 231060 Yes, mistress.
231230 233940 They come from a much older version<br />of the Matrix.
234110 238280 But like so many back then, they caused<br />more problems than they solved.
239030 244030 My husband saved them because<br />they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
244200 248250 How many people keep silver bullets<br />in their gun?
253000 256170 You can either run and tell my husband<br />what I have done...
256340 258920 ...or you can stay there and die.
259840 261800 He's in the ladies' room!
267890 269810 Hurry.
295380 298550 - My name is Neo.<br />- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
298760 300630 I've been waiting for you.
307470 311140 My God! My God, Persephone,<br />how could you do this? You betray me.
315480 318360 - Cause and effect, my love.<br />- Cause?
318480 321490 There is no cause for this. What cause?
321650 325950 What cause? How about the lipstick<br />you're still wearing?
326120 328830 Lipstick? Lipstick.
328990 332830 What craziness are you talking about,<br />woman? There is no lipstick!
334580 337210 She wasn't kissing your face, my love.
339710 342800 Woman, this is nothing.
342970 348510 - It is a game. It is only a game.<br />- So is this.
348720 350720 Have fun.
357190 358900 All right.
359070 360780 All right.
361070 363820 Let us find out where this goes.
364030 366870 You two, get the Keymaker.
373370 375370 That's a nice trick.
375540 376830 I cannot go back.
377420 379380 I'll handle them.
379880 385010 Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,<br />your predecessors had much more respect.
399400 401440 Okay, you have some skill.
403690 405650 Kill him.
465840 467880 You see? He's just a man.
602640 605440 Goddamn it, woman,<br />you will be the end of me.
607560 611530 Mark my words, boy,<br />and mark them well.
611690 616910 I have survived your predecessors,<br />and I will survive you.
637050 640390 - Where are you going?<br />- Another way. Always another way.
644560 646440 Close it, quick!
651230 653740 Could we move along?
657320 658870 Run!
674840 677130 Step away from the door.
682220 683520 We owe you for that.
685810 686980 Just like new.
687270 688690 Drop your weapon.
694110 695940 - Stay with him.<br />- What about Neo?
696110 697610 He can handle himself.
700700 701780 Get in back.
739450 740660 Shit.
741160 742620 - Operator.<br />- Link, where am I?
743200 746370 You won't believe this,<br />but you're way up in the mountains.
746660 749000 - Really?<br />- It'll take me a while to get an exit.
749460 750500 - Shit!<br />- What?
750710 753420 The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.<br />They don't have a way out.
753540 756920 - Where are they?<br />- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.
773730 775320 - Operator.<br />- Get us out of here.
775480 778190 - Won't be easy.<br />- I know. We're inside the core network.
778400 780990 The only exit I got<br />near you is the Winslow overpass.
781150 783240 - Off the freeway.<br />- Yes, sir.
783450 787160 - Fine, we'll make it.<br />- I should- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!
792210 793790 - Incoming fire.<br />- Down!
802050 803220 Hold on!
820240 822700 Oh, no. This is getting real ugly<br />real fast.
822860 824620 Are you watching this, Link?
824780 828410 Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.<br />Eight units headed your way.
829450 831410 Any suggestions?
833250 835250 - Turn right.<br />- Right, now.
842760 845590 Straight here.<br />You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
845760 848430 - Got it.<br />- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
848640 852310 - In 14 years of operating, I've never seen-<br />- Link, what did I tell you?
852600 854940 Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
855100 857560 - I'll be ready for you.<br />- Good man.
857770 859940 You always told me<br />to stay off the freeway.
860110 862690 - Yes, that's true.<br />- You said it was suicide.
862950 864820 Then let us hope...
865030 866410 ...that I was wrong.
877830 879380 - Operator.<br />- Link, it's Niobe.
879550 881130 We've been sent to bring you in.
881340 884420 - I need to talk to Morpheus.<br />- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
884590 886590 - Where is he?<br />- Just follow the sirens.
894100 896020 Repeat, they're approaching the-
899190 903400 - We have them now.<br />- The exile is the primary target.
967090 968050 Shots fired.
970640 972510 Move!
1082500 1085710 - We are getting aggravated.<br />- Yes, we are.
1131800 1133800 Trinity.
1134220 1135300 Get him out of here.
1138970 1141060 Come on!
1158030 1159580 Crush him.
1190060 1191060 Morpheus.
1191270 1192770 He's okay. Keep moving.
1193730 1195530 Let's go.
1201330 1203450 I need a download<br />to hot-wire a motorcycle.
1203620 1205950 No problem.<br />One crash course on motorcycle-
1206160 1207540 Wait.
1208920 1210420 Cancel that.
1210580 1212750 You are handy.
1212920 1214840 Jump on.
1362150 1363150 She means nothing.
1363360 1366450 - Find the exile.<br />- We have them.
1366780 1368950 One-Adam- 12, please respond.
1375420 1377130 Get down.
1508090 1509760 Gotcha.
1510510 1511590 She's good.
1515970 1518230 You are no longer necessary.
1524940 1528610 We do only what we're meant to do.
1530280 1533820 Then you are meant for one more thing:<br />deletion.
1534780 1536660 Go kick his ass.
1586710 1589460 Neo, if you're out there,<br />I could use some help.
1590260 1591670 What is that?
1621580 1624410 Yes! Yes!
1631050 1633170 We have confirmation from the Icarus.
1633300 1636180 First two ships<br />are in position for counterattack.
1636390 1637430 Good.
1638430 1639470 Any change?
1639640 1642430 They hit some iron ore here.<br />Slowed them down a little.
1642560 1645690 - How much?<br />- An hour, maybe.
1645850 1648400 That would give them<br />a little over nine hours.
1649270 1650860 Yes, sir.
1683470 1685770 There is a building.
1685930 1691570 Inside this building, there is a level<br />where no elevator can go...
1691770 1693650 ...and no stair can reach.
1694360 1699410 This level is filled with doors.<br />These doors lead to many places.
1700570 1702950 Hidden places.
1703290 1706870 But one door is special.
1707080 1709290 One door leads to the source.
1717630 1722010 This building is protected<br />by a very secure system.
1722180 1726730 - Every alarm triggers the bomb.<br />- Bomb? Did he say bomb?
1726980 1729650 But like all systems,<br />it has a weakness.
1729810 1732810 The system is based on the rules<br />of a building.
1732980 1736320 - One system built on another.<br />- Electricity.
1736900 1741660 - If one fails, so must the other.<br />- No electricity, no alarms.
1741820 1744620 You'd have to take out a city block<br />to kill the power.
1744830 1748500 - Not one, 27.<br />- Twenty-seven blocks?
1749370 1751830 There is a power station.
1752000 1754210 It must be destroyed.
1754420 1758720 - There must be some kind of fail-safe.<br />- Yes, there is an emergency system.
1760380 1764180 The core network of the grid<br />must be accessed.
1764350 1767180 The emergency system<br />must be deactivated.
1767350 1768730 What do you need us for?
1768890 1771060 Neo could take them out<br />easier than we could.
1771270 1772980 - There's no time.<br />- Why?
1773190 1776320 Once the door is unprotected,<br />the connection will be severed.
1776480 1778780 But another connection<br />must first be made.
1779610 1783450 - How long will that take?<br />- Exactly 314 seconds.
1783620 1785160 Just over five minutes.
1785330 1787620 That is the length and breadth<br />of the window.
1787790 1790040 Only the One can open the door...
1790250 1793170 ...and only during that window<br />can the door be opened.
1794420 1796040 How do you know all this?
1796210 1801340 I know because I must know.<br />It is my purpose.
1801510 1807060 It's the reason I'm here,<br />the same reason we're all here.
1817770 1820570 Neo, I know something's wrong.
1821280 1823320 You don't have to tell me.
1823490 1827240 I just want you to know that I'm here.
1830790 1832250 All must be done as one.
1836960 1838670 Can't hurt.
1842170 1844260 If one fails...
1845090 1846800 ...all fail.
1847140 1850970 At midnight, there is a shift change<br />in the security of both buildings.
1852180 1855560 At midnight, we will strike.
1856230 1857270 Hey!
1857440 1861400 - You count sheep at home.<br />- Why? I get paid to count them here.
1871580 1873790 Okay, they're inside.
1873960 1876460 - How much time?<br />- Twelve minutes.
1879210 1880300 Oh, shit.
1883670 1889100 All of our lives, we have fought this war.<br />Tonight, I believe we can end it.
1890640 1892770 Tonight is not an accident.
1894100 1896100 There are no accidents.
1897520 1902570 We have not come here by chance.<br />I do not believe in chance.
1902730 1908280 When I see three objectives,<br />three captains, three ships...
1908450 1911990 ...I do not see coincidence.<br />I see providence.
1912290 1914620 I see purpose.
1917370 1921670 I believe it is our fate to be here.<br />It is our destiny.
1923840 1928840 I believe this night holds<br />for each and every one of us...
1929050 1932390 ...the very meaning of our lives.
1932560 1936690 I want to ask you to do something,<br />but I don't know how.
1937310 1939230 I promise you, if I can, I will.
1940560 1943860 What if I asked you to stay out of this...
1944860 1946820 ...no matter what...
1946990 1949360 ...to stay out of the Matrix?
1950450 1952200 Why?
1960420 1961500 Please.
1963630 1964960 All right.
1968300 1970800 What is it, Niobe?
1970970 1975100 I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't<br />help thinking, what if you're wrong?
1975270 1978520 What if all this, the prophecy,<br />everything, is bullshit?
1978690 1982690 Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
1983150 1985730 But how would that be different<br />from any other day?
1995240 1999750 This is a war, and we are soldiers.
2001960 2004920 Death can come for us at any time...
2005460 2007210 ...in any place.
2007420 2009300 Incoming. Incoming!
2011260 2012930 Incoming!
2018850 2021270 Now consider the alternative.
2021440 2026070 What if I am right?<br />What if the prophecy is true?
2026230 2030610 What if tomorrow the war could be over?
2031570 2034580 Isn't that worth fighting for?
2035700 2038370 Isn't that worth dying for?
2039290 2041870 - Time?<br />- Three minutes.
2042080 2043210 Almost there.
2063230 2064650 It is done.
2064810 2066060 Find the others.
2067190 2069440 I got Niobe there.<br />They're out of the station.
2069650 2072280 - What about Soren?<br />- There.
2072450 2074280 They're still inside, but...
2075200 2076200 They're not moving.
2100390 2102310 That's it, let's go.
2104440 2106270 Call Neo now.
2110190 2113030 - I lost them. They're inside the portal.<br />- What about the grid?
2117160 2120700 Everything is operational.<br />The emergency system is rerouting power.
2126330 2128500 Jesus.
2128710 2132760 Soon as they open that door,<br />it's all over.
2132920 2134880 The hell it is.
2135590 2136970 What are you-? Trinity!
2138260 2141220 I will not wait and do nothing.<br />I will not watch them die.
2141390 2143520 We're talking less than five minutes.
2143680 2146230 In five minutes,<br />I'll tear that building down.
2146400 2149900 - How much further?<br />- Here, just here.
2151230 2155240 I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
2156410 2158870 It's gotta be the ugliest hack<br />I have ever done.
2162080 2165250 That's as close as I can get you.<br />You better grow wings.
2183270 2184890 - Operator.<br />- I'm in.
2185060 2187190 Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
2187810 2191980 You look surprised to see me again,<br />Mr. Anderson.
2192150 2197490 Well, that's the difference between us.<br />I have been expecting you.
2197650 2200570 - What do you want, Smith?<br />- You haven't figured that out?
2200740 2206290 Still using all the muscles<br />except the one that matters.
2206460 2209120 I want exactly what you want.
2209290 2211380 I want everything.
2211790 2214340 Would that include a bullet<br />from this gun?
2214510 2216300 Go ahead, shoot.
2216470 2221720 The best thing about being me,<br />there's so many me's.
2233110 2236780 Christ! What the hell happened in here?
2237650 2239700 Hold it right there, little lady.
2249040 2250830 If you can't beat us...
2251000 2252840 Join us.
2255000 2256090 Morpheus!
2269690 2272770 Still no sight of them.<br />They only got two minutes left.
2286490 2287580 One minute.
2296840 2297880 Come on.
2299050 2300970 Come on.
2301510 2303390 Please.
2313350 2314860 Kill them.
2322740 2323780 They're in.
2323950 2325910 I don't believe it.
2341510 2343630 It was meant to be.
2343800 2349140 Morpheus, that door will take you home.
2357940 2362240 You will know which door.<br />Hurry, Neo.
2367740 2370950 Trinity, I got some serious activity<br />headed your way.
2423260 2424590 Hello, Neo.
2425170 2428930 - Who are you?<br />- I am the Architect.
2429140 2432720 I created the Matrix.<br />I've been waiting for you.
2432970 2437190 You have many questions. Though the<br />process has altered your consciousness...
2437350 2439350 ...you remain irrevocably human.
2439520 2443070 Ergo, some of my answers you will<br />understand and some you will not.
2443530 2447570 Concordantly, while your first question<br />may be the most pertinent...
2447740 2451450 ...you may or may not realize<br />it is also the most irrelevant.
2452280 2453950 Why am I here?
2454080 2458000 Your life is the sum of a remainder<br />of an unbalanced equation...
2458170 2460540 ...inherent to the programming<br />of the Matrix.
2460710 2464800 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,<br />which despite my sincerest efforts...
2464960 2467800 ...I've been unable to eliminate<br />from what is otherwise...
2467970 2472390 ...a harmony of mathematical precision.
2472760 2475100 While it remains a burden<br />assiduously avoided...
2475270 2479690 ...it is not unexpected and thus<br />not beyond a measure of control...
2479900 2483820 ...which has led you, inexorably...
2484780 2486070 ...here.
2486240 2490320 - You haven't answered my question.<br />- Quite right.
2490490 2494280 Interesting.<br />That was quicker than the others.
2494450 2497040 Others? How many?<br />What others?
2497250 2499710 The Matrix is older than you know.
2499870 2503880 I count from the emergence of one integral<br />anomaly to the emergence of the next.
2504040 2506340 In which case, this is the sixth version.
2506510 2508920 Five before me?<br />He's lying. Bullshit.
2509090 2512680 There are only two possible explanations.<br />There were five before me.
2512850 2514100 Either no one told me...
2515350 2519350 - ... or no one knows.<br />- Precisely.
2519520 2522860 As you are undoubtedly gathering,<br />the anomaly is systemic...
2523020 2526400 ...creating fluctuations in even<br />the most simplistic equations.
2526570 2529860 You can't control me!<br />I'm gonna smash you to bits!
2530030 2531820 I'm gonna fucking kill you!
2531990 2535160 You can't make me do anything.<br />You old, white prick!
2537450 2538950 Choice.
2539120 2540960 The problem is choice.
2563150 2566770 The first Matrix I designed<br />was naturally perfect, a work of art.
2566980 2568820 Flawless, sublime.
2568980 2572450 A triumph equaled only<br />by its monumental failure.
2573160 2575530 The inevitability of its doom<br />is apparent now...
2575740 2579080 ...as a consequence of the imperfection<br />inherent in every human.
2579240 2582160 Thus, I redesigned it<br />based on your history...
2582330 2586340 ...to more accurately reflect<br />the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
2587090 2590800 However, I was again frustrated<br />by failure.
2592300 2594930 I have come to understand<br />that the answer eluded me...
2595090 2597140 ...because it required a lesser mind.
2597300 2603270 Or perhaps, a mind less bound<br />by the parameters of perfection.
2603690 2608070 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon<br />by another, an intuitive program...
2608270 2613030 ...initially created to investigate<br />certain aspects of the human psyche.
2613200 2619160 If I am the father of the Matrix,<br />she would undoubtedly be its mother.
2619830 2622080 - The Oracle.<br />- Please.
2622830 2626830 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br />solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
2627000 2629880 ...accepted the program, as long as they<br />were given a choice...
2630050 2634170 ...even if they were only aware<br />of the choice at a near unconscious level.
2634300 2637760 While this answer functioned,<br />it was fundamentally flawed...
2637930 2641930 ...thus creating the otherwise<br />contradictory systemic anomaly...
2642100 2644770 ...that, if left unchecked,<br />might threaten the system.
2645190 2649310 Ergo, those that refused the program,<br />while a minority, if unchecked...
2649480 2653530 ...would constitute<br />an escalating probability of disaster.
2653690 2655530 This is about Zion.
2655950 2659620 You are here because Zion<br />is about to be destroyed.
2659780 2664250 Its every living inhabitant terminated,<br />its entire existence eradicated.
2664540 2665540 Bullshit.
2665750 2668880 Denial is the most predictable<br />of all human responses.
2669080 2673590 But rest assured, this will be<br />the sixth time we have destroyed it...
2675760 2679760 ...and we have become<br />exceedingly efficient at it.
2692440 2693780 The function of the One...
2693940 2698570 ...is now to return to the source, allowing<br />a dissemination of the code you carry...
2698740 2700450 ...reinserting the prime program.
2701070 2705080 After which you will be required to select<br />from the Matrix 23 individuals...
2705250 2708500 ...sixteen female, seven male,<br />to rebuild Zion.
2708620 2713210 Failure to comply with this process<br />will result in a cataclysmic system crash...
2713380 2715670 ...killing everyone connected<br />to the Matrix...
2715840 2718470 ...which, coupled with the<br />extermination of Zion...
2718630 2722800 ...will result in the extinction<br />of the entire human race.
2723140 2727230 You won't let it happen. You can't.<br />You need human beings to survive.
2728020 2731690 There are levels of survival<br />we are prepared to accept.
2731860 2734650 The relevant issue is<br />whether or not you are ready...
2734820 2738360 ...to accept the responsibility for the<br />death of every human being in this world.
2744870 2747370 It is interesting reading your reactions.
2748410 2752250 Your five predecessors were, by design,<br />based on a similar predication...
2752420 2756920 ...a contingent affirmation that was meant<br />to create a profound attachment...
2757090 2760630 ...to the rest of your species,<br />facilitating the function of the One.
2760800 2763180 While the others experience this<br />in a general way...
2763350 2766310 ...your experience is far more specific...
2766600 2769520 ...vis-�-vis love.
2770520 2772150 Trinity!
2774440 2778740 Apropos, she entered the Matrix<br />to save your life at the cost of her own.
2779110 2780150 No.
2780860 2784990 Which brings us at last to the moment<br />of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
2785160 2788250 ...is ultimately expressed<br />and the anomaly revealed...
2788450 2792420 ...as both beginning and end.
2792620 2794250 There are two doors.
2794420 2797670 The door to your right leads to the source<br />and the salvation of Zion.
2798210 2803510 The door to your left leads back to the<br />Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
2804720 2809100 As you adequately put,<br />the problem is choice.
2809270 2812730 But we already know what<br />you are going to do, don't we?
2812940 2817020 Already I can see the chain reaction,<br />the chemical precursors that signal...
2817190 2822400 ...the onset of an emotion designed<br />specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
2822610 2827240 An emotion that is already blinding you<br />from the simple and obvious truth:
2827410 2831870 She is going to die and there is nothing<br />you can do to stop it.
2838920 2843010 Hope. It is the quintessential<br />human delusion, simultaneously...
2843180 2846890 ...the source of your greatest strength<br />and your greatest weakness.
2847050 2851390 If I were you, I would hope<br />that we don't meet again.
2851600 2852980 We won't.
2860400 2862610 We got a serious situation, sir.
2863110 2864200 Oh, no.
2923840 2927340 - What was that? - It's moving<br />faster than anything I've seen.
2978020 2979770 Holy shit, he caught her.
2993700 2995540 Neo, I had to.
2995740 2997500 I know.
3002540 3005050 The bullet is still inside.
3015850 3017770 Trinity...
3018980 3020690 ...don't you quit on me now.
3029860 3032410 I'm sorry.
3038950 3041250 Trinity.
3051220 3053180 Trinity...
3053340 3055100 ...I know you can hear me.
3055890 3058470 I'm not letting go.
3058640 3060230 I can't.
3061480 3063690 I love you too damn much.
3092380 3093630 I can't take this.
3097430 3100520 I guess this makes us even.
3113150 3115110 I don't understand it.
3115320 3118280 Everything was done<br />as it was supposed to be done.
3118490 3121540 Once the One reaches the source,<br />the war should be over.
3121700 3124540 - In 24 hours, it will be.<br />- What?
3124710 3129000 If we don't do something in 24 hours,<br />Zion will be destroyed.
3129420 3131090 - What?<br />- How do you know that?
3131510 3133550 - I was told it would happen.<br />- By whom?
3134550 3137390 It doesn't matter. I believed him.
3137550 3141390 - That's impossible. The prophecy tells us-<br />- It was a lie, Morpheus.
3143180 3145690 The prophecy was a lie.
3146940 3149940 The One was never meant<br />to end anything.
3150110 3153150 It was all another system of control.
3153320 3156410 I don't believe that.
3156700 3159070 But you said it yourself.
3159240 3163250 How can the prophecy be true<br />if the war isn't over?
3169420 3171840 I'm sorry.
3172000 3175420 I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
3175590 3178760 ...I swear to you it's the truth.
3181970 3184680 - What are we gonna do?<br />- I don't know.
3186890 3188060 Oh, no!
3197400 3200740 - What are they doing?<br />- They're just out of EMP range.
3201280 3202490 It's a bomb.
3203660 3205910 We have to get out of here. Now.
3242620 3244450 I have dreamed a dream...
3247500 3250920 ...but now that dream<br />has gone from me.
3261970 3264220 Here they come.
3264470 3266180 Let's go, Morpheus.
3267600 3270600 - We won't make it.<br />- We have to try.
3278360 3281360 - Come on!<br />- Something's different.
3281530 3283530 What?
3284160 3285700 I can feel them.
3308600 3310180 Neo!
3316400 3319990 - What happened?<br />- I don't know.
3325240 3327160 It's the Hammer.
3338840 3341550 He's in some kind of coma...
3341720 3343930 ...but his vitals are stable.
3345140 3347050 What about you?
3347220 3349350 I'm fine.
3349560 3351930 You could use some rest.
3352100 3353940 No, I'm gonna stay with him.
3361030 3363610 Lock was right.<br />He guessed that the machines...
3363820 3366660 ...would cut off the mainlines<br />in and out of Zion.
3366870 3369580 He thought a counterattack<br />might surprise them.
3369870 3373290 It sounded good.<br />I figured we had a shot...
3373580 3376170 ...until someone screwed it up.
3376330 3378920 An EMP was triggered before<br />we got in position.
3379130 3382920 - Five ships were instantly downed.<br />- When the machines broke through...
3383130 3386340 ...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
3386510 3389350 Was it an accident?<br />Some sort of malfunction?
3389510 3391930 - No one knows.<br />- Someone does.
3392100 3393850 Who?
3394020 3397730 Once the machines were done with us,<br />they started digging again.
3397940 3400190 We made a quick pass<br />to look for survivors.
3400440 3401530 You found one?
3403240 3404990 Only one.
3998040 4001380 Everything that has a beginning...
4001540 4003250 ...has an end.
4005670 4008550 I see the end coming.
4008720 4012510 I see the darkness spreading.<br />I see death.
4014640 4017640 Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
4017810 4019810 We missed you.
4019980 4021810 It ends tonight.
4029030 4032110 You are all that stands in his way.
4033700 4038290 If you cannot stop him tonight, then<br />I fear that tomorrow may never come.
