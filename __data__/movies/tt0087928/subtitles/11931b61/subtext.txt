120120 121411 Hello...
122288 123956 Tackleberry.
128294 130379 We're all gonna miss you around here.
130547 133549 The Police Academy's getting itself<br />a real fine recruit.
136344 138095 May I...
138471 140013 go now?
141307 142808 Affirmative, sir.
144519 146061 Ten-four.
146229 149439 Yes, of course. Ten-four.
227560 228894 You guys.
230605 231813 Surprise.
235735 237194 Lot's full, mister.
238905 241573 Look, don't give me that crap.
241741 244660 - You've got a space.<br />- The lot's full, sir, really.
244827 247079 Find a spot, dickhead.
247830 250249 - Dickhead?<br />- That's right. Where's the manager?
250416 251583 Dickhead?
251751 253835 Park the car, butt breath.
254003 256171 - Butt breath?<br />- Yeah.
257173 260342 Wait a minute. Hold everything.<br />That's a wig, isn't it?
260510 262719 - Ahem. Park the car.<br />- Yeah, that's a wig.
262887 265305 Wig! Wig! Dong-dong-dong!
265473 268267 - Wig alert! Wig alert! Dong-dong-dong!<br />- Park the car, asshole. Shut up.
268434 270227 Girls. It's a rug.
270937 272980 What the hell's going on here? Hi, Lou.
273606 276650 - Lou?<br />- This rude little punk won't park my car.
276818 278527 Mahoney, park this car.
278695 280028 If you can find a spot...
280196 283365 Do it now or you're fired.<br />You understand? Fired.
283533 286827 Fired? That's not fair,<br />the guy has a bad attitude.
286995 288412 Do it, okay?
288579 292457 I want you to apologize to this man,<br />then park his car.
294502 296211 Yes, sir.
298298 300549 - I'm sorry.<br />- Get out of here.
300717 302634 And clean the ashtray while you're at it.
308933 312102 Yeah, I'm sorry, Lou. You just can't get<br />good help these days.
314147 316565 - Respect for anything.<br />- They don't respect customers.
316733 319609 They don't respect property.<br />They don't respect respect.
321154 323488 Holy shit. Jesus.
330204 333081 It fits. Damn thing fits.
333249 336668 I thought there were no more spaces.<br />Am I an idiot or what?
343343 344384 Hi, fellas.
353603 354644 Hey, guys, just...
355730 357189 Hey, hey!
373122 375665 Guys, I don't think I'm supposed<br />to get the photos wet.
385009 388428 You're going to pay for this.<br />Mark my words.
388596 391723 And you want to know why?
396062 399648 I'll let you know why. It's no secret.<br />Everybody knows.
399816 402150 I'm joining the police force. Ha, ha!
402318 404486 What do you think of that?
404654 406113 Now who's in charge?
413579 415831 Hey, sarge, it's him again.
415998 418458 I'll call Captain Reed.<br />Sit over there, Mahoney.
418626 420293 All right, let's go.
425216 427467 Sit. And stay there.
438521 441481 - What are you in for?<br />- I'll show you.
446571 448530 Goddamn it! Stop that!
448698 450157 Oh, no, sir. No, not you.
450324 452075 That's terrific. Really.
452660 456371 - What's your name?<br />- Jones. Larvell Jones.
456539 458957 Monsignor Larvell Jones.
459125 460208 M.D.
460376 462502 - Let's go, Mahoney.<br />- See you around, monsignor.
462670 465046 Doctor monsignor.
475600 478393 Why can't you stay out of trouble?
478728 480187 I mean...
481606 484566 What's wrong with you?<br />Last week: Disturbing the peace.
484734 488403 Week before that:<br />Destroying private property.
488571 492240 And I'm getting tired of saving your butt.
493493 496203 I only do it because of your father.
497622 500540 - He was a good friend.<br />- Yeah, I know.
500708 503251 Now, Mahoney, I've made a decision.
503419 505795 I ain't gonna help you this time.
505963 508840 You're going to the county lockup.
509509 510884 - Lockup?<br />- Mm-hm.
511052 515013 Why? I didn't do anything really major.
515181 517974 - Then I'll make a deal with you.<br />- Anything.
518142 520977 I want you to go to the Police Academy.
521145 522938 The Police Academy?
523105 526149 Even if you never graduate,<br />the training will be good for you.
526317 527859 Wait a minute.
528027 529986 Wait a minute. Reed?
530154 533698 Listen, you've seen the commercials<br />on TV.
534033 537661 The Academy's taking<br />all kinds these days.
538454 540455 Anybody can get in.
541541 542874 Even you.
543209 545377 No deal. That's nuts.
545545 548296 Well, it's either that or the lockup.
548714 552133 - Police Academy or jail.<br />- Will I get my own squad car?
552301 555971 You'll get 14 weeks of Academy training<br />and discipline...
556138 559224 - Starting Monday morning.<br />- Fourteen weeks.
559392 561601 Oh, they can throw you out.
561769 564688 But you can't quit.<br />You quit, and you're back in jail.
564855 566940 That's the deal.
567441 569442 - Can I bring a friend?<br />- Who?
569610 571736 Monsignor Larvell Jones,<br />my personal physician.
572947 574739 You decide.
575908 579077 Honey, please don't go. I love you.<br />I don't want to see you hurt.
579245 581496 I worry about you.<br />You're so accident-prone.
581664 584124 And the Police Academy<br />is such a dangerous place.
584292 587711 Honey, don't worry. I'll be okay.
587878 589254 Everything'll be okay.
589422 591798 You start that car<br />and you're a dead man, buster.
591966 593341 Honey, I'm late.
593509 597846 You pull out of that driveway<br />and I'll have your head on a pole.
600057 602934 Come back here, you turkey!
633299 637344 You move this car an inch<br />and you're finished, mister. You hear me?
644977 649397 Of all the things that you could be<br />in this world, why a policeman?
649565 652734 A policewoman, mother.
654111 655153 But why?
655321 657489 Because it's exciting, it's different.
657657 660241 It'll give me a chance to meet<br />interesting and unusual people.
660409 662410 Right now! If you don't pull over...
662578 665163 People who aren't like you and me.
708999 711626 - Hey, look, it's the chief.<br />- Really?
711794 713461 Hey, mention my name.
718551 720593 Cadet Kyle Blankes<br />reporting for duty, sir.
720761 722887 Get away from me, you asshole.
723055 724389 Yes, sir.
742825 746119 - Where are we, man?<br />- Ecuador.
749915 754461 Okay! Oh, here we are.<br />I got to go now. Bye.
754628 757797 - Bye, sweet-pea. Bye, cutie-pie.<br />- We'll miss you.
757965 760341 - Okay.<br />- Bye!
760509 764053 Okay, girls. Remember, I love yous.
764221 767015 - Bye!<br />- Introduce yourself around, man.
769935 773480 Bye! Bye, babies. Goodbye.
774857 775899 Hey, excuse me.
776066 777692 - Do you know all those women?<br />- Sure.
777860 779611 - They're my girlfriends.<br />- All of them?
779779 781571 - Yeah.<br />- Carey Mahoney.
781739 783239 I'm George Martin, Carey.
783407 785575 We should be pals.<br />You're an interesting guy.
785743 787202 You a cadet?
787369 789496 I am until I can get myself<br />thrown out of here.
789663 790705 I'll be gone by 10:00.
790873 793374 You, like, joined the Academy<br />to get thrown out?
793542 794584 That's right.
794752 797504 Hey, you're a pretty interesting guy<br />yourself.
806806 808681 Look at that.
809225 811643 Just look at that.
812144 815855 Look at that scum.<br />When I went through this academy...
816023 818900 every cadet was the right weight,<br />the right height, color...
819068 821611 and they all had Johnsons, Lassard.
821779 823947 Every single one of them.
824114 825156 Johnsons?
825324 827575 You know...
828911 830495 Oh, yes.
831330 835542 Back in the old days, there were Johnsons<br />as far as the eye could see.
835709 838586 And what a lovely sight it was.
839755 841923 Have you seen these applications?
843676 847303 Have you seen what our new lady mayor<br />has brought us?
847471 849597 Do you know she is attempting<br />to dismantle...
849765 853184 one of this country's great institutions<br />of law and order?
853352 855770 What do you say to that, Lassard?
856355 857939 The bitch.
858816 861150 - Commandant?<br />- Yes, chief.
861318 864946 The mayor says we've got<br />to take this flotsam.
865114 868783 But that doesn't mean<br />we have to put them on the force.
868951 870743 You get my drift?
870911 874455 Weed the undesirables out.
874623 877125 - Get rid of them.<br />- No problem, chief.
877293 879210 We'll start washing them out<br />this morning.
879378 881087 We don't throw them out.
881255 884591 They must be encouraged to quit<br />on their own.
884758 888761 - Do you understand?<br />- I think I understand, sir.
888929 892432 Thank you, Lieutenant Harris,<br />I'm sure you do.
893684 895226 - Lassard?<br />- What?
895895 897562 Do you understand?
897730 900732 - It's clear as glass, chief.<br />- Good.
900900 903610 Then we all know what to do.
929803 931554 That's it...
932932 935642 There sure are a lot<br />of spades around here.
943275 945276 Which I think is good.
945444 947612 Very good for the Academy.
947780 950490 What the hell are you doing here?
951367 953743 I want to be a police officer.
953911 957872 What? I can't hear you.
958624 962377 I want to be a police officer.
964463 967173 - Don't unpack.<br />- Well...
967341 969217 time to get thrown out.
970219 973137 Princess. Princess! Prin...!
974974 977058 - What's your name, Cadet?<br />- Thompson, sir.
977226 978851 - You live around here?<br />- No, sir.
979019 980937 What's your telephone number,<br />Thompson?
981105 983398 Come on, eyes front. Telephone number.
983565 985900 5-5-52-4-6-7, sir.
986068 988987 Okay, let's see the thighs.
989154 993241 Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.<br />The thighs.
994868 997996 - What in the hell are you doing?<br />- Meeting women, sir.
998163 1000623 What's your name, dirtbag?
1000791 1002875 - Dirtbag?<br />- Your name?
1003043 1004711 Mahoney, sir.
1004878 1006129 Back in line, Mahoney.
1006296 1009549 Sir, can I have a second with you?<br />Listen.
1009717 1011801 I don't really belong here.<br />I'm not right for this.
1011969 1016556 Get back in line.
1017683 1019434 Now!
1020936 1024105 Mom, it's all right. Don't worry.<br />Come here, Princess.
1054803 1058973 My name is Commandant Lassard.<br />Welcome to the new police force.
1059725 1062268 Your training time here will last...
1063479 1064979 Fourteen.
1065147 1067106 Fourteen weeks.
1067274 1071569 You will be schooled in firearms,<br />police procedures, local laws...
1071737 1073613 and many, many other things.
1073781 1077158 After those 12 weeks,<br />some of you will be police officers...
1077326 1078910 and some of you will not.
1079078 1080328 Some of you will be...
1082164 1083706 Here at the Academy...
1085000 1086793 Here at the Academy...
1086960 1088753 you will learn...
1088921 1090546 You will learn...
1091590 1093091 Princess. Princess. Come here.
1093258 1095551 Princess?<br />Looks more like a prince to me.
1097513 1100306 - Give me that dog.<br />- Ahem. But he's mine, sir.
1100474 1101682 He's a queer.
1101850 1106437 Cadets, proceed to the supply room<br />and draw your uniforms.
1106605 1110733 Fall out. Let's go. Move it.<br />Move it, move it, move it.
1115864 1118658 - Next.<br />- What about guns? When do we get guns?
1118826 1120326 Next.
1121286 1124372 - I'm a size 9, sometimes a size 10.<br />- Next.
1132798 1136425 Hey! You three dirtbags report<br />to the Academy barber...
1136593 1138094 before you do anything else.
1138262 1139679 Where's that?
1139847 1142265 Find it, rat face.
1142432 1143808 Rat face?
1143976 1146894 - He probably meant the other guy.<br />- Oh. Oh, okay.
1147062 1149147 - What's that?<br />- That's where the commandant...
1149314 1151399 - And his wife live.<br />- Nice.
1151567 1153985 Oh. Excuse me.<br />Do you know where we get our clothes?
1154153 1157238 Yeah. You gotta go right over there.
1157406 1158906 - Here? Okay, thanks.<br />- Mm-hm.
1159074 1162118 - Go in and tell them Mahoney sent you.<br />- Got it.
1162578 1165997 - Be out of here by 3:00.<br />- Move it, dirtbag. I'm first.
1166165 1168249 And I'm next.
1169126 1172795 For important guys like you, I'll wait.
1176216 1179093 Okay, let's go. Take it all off.
1179261 1180469 You got it.
1197070 1198154 Hello?
1226975 1232313 - Just a little off the side, please.<br />- You bet.
1232481 1236817 - You can do that?<br />- Sure. This ain't the Army, you know.
1240989 1245826 Let's go, let's go! We've got to find<br />you little babies a place to sleep.
1245994 1248704 Better listen up, you fart-blossoms.
1248872 1252708 - You sure you said Mahoney?<br />- Yeah, I even spelled it to her.
1252876 1254585 - Copeland and Blankes, in here.<br />- Sir.
1254753 1257672 This man is my personal physician.<br />I can't live without him, sir.
1257839 1260591 Right down here,<br />I want Fackler and Martin.
1260759 1262343 I've known him since childhood...
1262511 1267306 - Right here, Mahoney and Tackleberry.<br />- Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!
1269476 1271435 Thank you.<br />I've always wanted to live with a nut.
1271603 1273854 My pleasure.
1274314 1276857 - Mahoney, is it?<br />- Yes, sir. I'd like to say one more...
1277025 1281028 The rest of you wimps come with me.<br />Move it, move it, move it.
1281196 1282488 Wimps?
1287077 1289412 - You're married?<br />- Yeah.
1290122 1291872 That's beautiful, man.
1292040 1294208 To me, marriage is a sacred institution.
1295252 1296711 So tell me.
1296878 1299588 You and the wife do it doggie-style<br />or what?
1316481 1318774 Room ready for inspection, sir.
1320610 1321986 Good haircuts, men.
1322154 1324030 - Thank you, sir.<br />- Thank you, sir.
1324740 1326407 Damn good haircuts.
1326575 1328326 - Thank you, sir.<br />- Thank you, sir.
1334750 1336250 Men...
1336418 1338627 I've got a little problem.
1339129 1342715 It seems I've got a squad<br />full of scumbuckets.
1342883 1345051 A whole big bunch of losers.
1345719 1349138 And I was kind of hoping<br />that you two fine, young cadets...
1349973 1352933 might help me to just get rid of<br />a few of them.
1353477 1357396 What do you say?<br />Will you help me out?
1358690 1361442 - Yes, sir.<br />- Good.
1363570 1367656 - Good.<br />- I'm Copeland, sir. Chad Copeland.
1368533 1370159 Good for you.
1373246 1376332 Hi, I'm Douglas Fackler.<br />I always wanted to be a cop.
1392724 1395017 Lieutenant Hoffman, Lieutenant Hoffman...
1395185 1397269 report immediately to the infirmary.
1397813 1399814 Hey, Thompson. Well?
1399981 1402650 - How do I look?<br />- That wasn't very funny this morning.
1402818 1405319 Wasn't funny.<br />I'd give anything to see your thighs.
1405487 1407571 Don't suppose you'd<br />describe them for me.
1407739 1412284 Well, they're tan, of course.<br />Very supple, well-rounded...
1412452 1415329 and luxuriant to the touch.
1415497 1416580 Mm.
1416748 1419583 Absolute silence!
1424798 1429176 My name is Lt. Harris...
1429344 1431720 in case you missed it.
1435642 1439061 This is Sgt. Callahan...
1439229 1441397 in case you missed it.
1441565 1445693 We are the meanest instructors here.
1445861 1451782 We've got you because<br />you are the worst people here.
1453785 1456579 You people are D-Squad.
1456746 1459290 D for dirtbags.
1459458 1464378 When I say, "Hey, dirtbags,"<br />that means you.
1464546 1469049 You people are going to hate my guts<br />for the rest of your lives.
1469217 1474305 I am going to make you sorry<br />that you ever came here.
1474681 1478476 Now, it is traditional here at the Academy<br />for each squad...
1478643 1481020 to have two student squad-leaders.
1481188 1486025 I have chosen Cadets Blankes<br />and Dopeland. Step out, men.
1486735 1490237 If these two cadets give you an order...
1490822 1494074 obey it.
1495785 1499246 Now, I thought it would be nice...
1499414 1503292 if we were to close out<br />our first afternoon together...
1503460 1507671 with a nice little stroll<br />around the campus.
1512844 1516347 Move out, maggots!
1522854 1526941 - Holy, shit.<br />- This is definitely not Ecuador.
1530820 1532947 Get up, Barbara. Get up. Get up.
1533114 1534615 Move it, move it, move it.
1534783 1538244 I could show a movie on your butt, fatso.
1538411 1540913 Nineteen. Twenty!
1542874 1546919 More! I want more!
1547087 1549547 Fifteen.
1549714 1551757 Sixteen.
1551925 1554134 Seventeen.
1554302 1559098 Eighteen. Let's go. Let's go.
1559266 1563477 Nine. Ten.
1566356 1569525 Attention. Lights out in 10 minutes.
1569693 1572653 Lights out in 10 minutes.
1606605 1609064 Game over.
1618700 1620659 Asshole.
1620910 1624663 Police work...
1624831 1627875 is what...
1628043 1630210 you are...
1630378 1634381 here for.
1635175 1638177 Arrest...
1638345 1642848 procedures...
1643016 1647561 traffic violations...
1647729 1650022 high-speed...
1650190 1652358 driving...
1652525 1654610 self-defense.
1654778 1660532 And you will have many examinations...
1660700 1664244 which you must pass.
1664913 1666497 Plus...
1666998 1671377 you will endure an extremely rigorous<br />physical training program.
1671544 1674588 Do you know what that means, Hooks?
1675882 1678217 I'm not sure, sir.
1678385 1680010 What?
1682514 1684807 Voice commands.
1684974 1688936 We will learn to use our voices<br />with authority.
1689104 1691105 Won't we, Hooks?
1694442 1699780 Now, have any of you<br />had any military training?
1702784 1703784 Mm-hm?
1703952 1708288 I served with the U.S. Army<br />Airborne 209th Special Forces Unit.
1708665 1710082 Anybody else?
1710250 1711542 What?
1712252 1715838 You have had prior<br />military training, Mahoney?
1716005 1719174 - Well, yes, but not in this life, sir.<br />- What?
1719342 1722386 In a previous life, I served<br />with Her Majesty's Forces in India.
1722554 1726223 - Interesting sideline...<br />- If you're trying to get thrown out...
1726391 1728559 I'm afraid that's quite impossible.
1728727 1731103 Impossible?<br />What the hell's going on here?
1731271 1733272 I'll have to see<br />the commandant about this.
1733440 1739611 You will also learn the Municipal Code.<br />And you will learn them by heart.
1740196 1741613 Cadet Mahoney. Cadet Mahoney.
1741781 1745534 Report immediately to the commandant's<br />office. Cadet Mahoney.
1745702 1751665 Okay, Mahoney, get going. On the double.<br />Move it. Move it. Move it.
1753960 1755002 Now...
1755170 1756962 Lieutenant Harris, Lieutenant Harris...
1757130 1760048 report immediately to the firing range.<br />Lieutenant Harris.
1761968 1763677 Excuse me.
1764137 1765471 Callahan, take over.
1768808 1770309 Howdy.
1770643 1772978 - No one's allowed in here.<br />- Listen.
1773146 1775522 - I got a problem, chief.<br />- It's commandant.
1775690 1778525 Commandant, I'm sorry.<br />Is that your fish?
1778693 1780819 - No, it belongs to a friend.<br />- Very pretty.
1780987 1783614 - What do you want?<br />- I want out of here. Right now.
1783782 1786909 - Out of this office?<br />- No, out of the Academy.
1787076 1789995 - That's no problem. You can just quit.<br />- I can't quit.
1790163 1792873 Of course you can.<br />Many, many wonderful people...
1793041 1795083 - Have quit many, many...<br />- Commandant?
1795668 1797169 Do you know Capt. Reed?
1797337 1801924 Oh, yes. Capt. Reed. You're Mahoney.
1803718 1807262 Mahoney. Mahoney. Mahoney.
1808473 1811266 - You're a special case. You can't quit.<br />- I know that.
1811434 1814561 - On the other hand, I can't throw you out.<br />- Why not?
1814729 1818732 I promised Capt. Reed. I promised<br />I'd keep you here the full 24 weeks.
1819526 1823028 You what? You what? You told...?
1823196 1825781 He told me that I could...
1827909 1831578 - I'm trapped here?<br />- Well, yes. We all are.
1833289 1836208 Pick it up, pick it up.<br />Keep moving up that hill.
1838503 1839920 Put some muscle in it.
1840088 1842923 Get those knees up.<br />Get those knees up, come on!
1854602 1855978 Hustle, hustle, hustle!
1856145 1857980 This is definitely not for me.
1863778 1864862 Keep going!
1877709 1882796 Come on, Hooks, get over the wall.<br />Move it, move it, move it.
1883590 1886675 Come on, Hooks, get up.
1886843 1890846 Skip it. Go around. You'll never make it.<br />Why don't you quit now?
1891014 1893932 Quit, quit, quit. You'll never make it.
1894100 1899146 Sir, I'm terribly sorry,<br />but I seem to have ripped my pants.
1904319 1906361 Don't try me, punk.
1907614 1909781 Now, wise guy...
1909949 1912034 you run, don't trot...
1912201 1916538 to the supply room,<br />and you get a new pair.
1917206 1919625 Yes, sir. I'll be back later in the day.
1919792 1923170 Be back in five minutes!
1923338 1926173 Yes, sir. Shit, I'm deaf.
1937310 1939353 Hey, you got any brown shoe-polish?
1939520 1941104 I've got cordovan. Who's it for?
1941272 1943190 Lieutenant Harris.
1961000 1963543 Sir! Look, sir, new pants.
1963711 1965671 What are you doing...? Give me that.
1965838 1969925 All right, you scumbags, you have<br />30 minutes to shower and get to class.
1970093 1972678 Let's go. Move it. Move it. Move it.
1972845 1975013 Pick it up. Pick it up.
1975181 1978058 Pick it up, assholes.
1985858 1988610 So far, nobody's quit.
1988778 1989861 But they will.
2013761 2016138 Well, well, well.
2017015 2020100 I told you not to try me, boy.
2021269 2022769 Stand up.
2024856 2027649 Now, I want you two squad leaders...
2027817 2030944 to take Mr. Mahoney here<br />and run him until he throws up.
2031112 2032154 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, sir.
2032321 2035532 And then, just after he throws up...
2035700 2037034 run him some more.
2037201 2038910 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, sir.
2041497 2044374 You are going to learn, Mahoney...
2044792 2046793 that nobody...
2047920 2050130 nobody...
2050298 2052466 screws...
2053051 2054801 with me.
2055511 2058013 - Pick it up, pick it up! Come on!<br />- Hey, this is great.
2058181 2059973 - Two assholes, no waiting.<br />- Move it!
2060141 2063560 Chad, would you please just let me<br />yell at him without interrupting?
2063728 2067105 - Sure.<br />- Come on, Mahoney! Move it, move it!
2116823 2118365 Bang!
2128501 2131878 Son, where did you get this gun?
2132130 2135006 My mom gave it to me.
2135174 2137968 Can I borrow it for a little while?
2138136 2140011 Sure.
2141556 2147060 Left, left right left.<br />Left, left, left right left.
2147812 2153900 You will learn to defend yourselves<br />without stick or firearm.
2155027 2156570 I need a volunteer.
2156737 2159823 - Barbara, get out here.<br />- I just ate.
2159991 2164119 Right where I'm standing.<br />Right here. Right now.
2166706 2169541 All right, come at me<br />with an imaginary knife.
2169709 2170917 Do I have to?
2171085 2174588 Yes, you do. I'm not joking.
2174755 2177507 Come on. Come on.
2177675 2180468 Now!
2180636 2182888 Ouch! Ouch!
2186809 2190478 Okay. That's how it's done. Who's next?
2190646 2192772 - Pick me!<br />- I'd love it. I'd love to go.
2192940 2195192 I'd love to go. We'll both go.
2195443 2197611 You have 20 minutes<br />to complete the test.
2197778 2200989 Try to answer as many questions<br />as possible.
2201157 2203533 All right, start.
2214462 2218506 All right, here we go.<br />The count's at two. Here's the pitch.
2218966 2220383 Swung on and missed!
2222136 2223845 Struck out.
2237818 2241821 Well, it was Saturday night<br />And I was feeling all right
2241989 2243823 Looking for my buttercup
2244951 2248745 They were dancing next door<br />On the thirteenth floor
2286325 2287742 You know, Mahoney...
2287910 2292372 I'd like to spend the next month<br />breaking you into little pieces.
2293332 2294958 But I won't...
2295167 2297210 because you're bad.
2297378 2299879 You're bad for morale, Mahoney.
2300631 2303633 You look like the sweet little boy<br />from next door.
2303801 2306011 Ha. But you don't fool me. Oh, no.
2306178 2309556 No, you're the devil,<br />and you're rotten to the core.
2309724 2311391 And you're ruining my chances...
2311559 2314477 of training some men<br />who might make pretty good cops.
2314645 2316229 I agree. I've been saying that.
2316397 2319482 - You make me sick.<br />- Thank you, sir. I make everybody sick.
2319650 2323403 We're going to pick up this telephone<br />and call your buddy Capt. Reed.
2323571 2328074 And you. You are going to help me<br />talk him out of this terrible mistake.
2328743 2330076 Terrific. I'll do my part.
2330244 2332370 You're damn right you will.
2334874 2336249 Ha.
2339754 2343882 This is the Academy.<br />I'd like to speak to a Capt. Reed.
2344800 2346926 Reed!
2350556 2353892 Captain Reed? Yes, sir.<br />How are you, sir?
2354060 2357937 This is Lt. Harris, Lt. Thaddeus Harris<br />out at the Police Academy.
2358105 2360982 I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir...
2361150 2365111 but your friend Cadet Mahoney<br />would like to speak with you.
2365279 2368198 Just one moment, please. Mahoney.
2368366 2371242 - Mahoney!<br />- Oh, yeah.
2371952 2374454 Hi, Captain Reed? Can I get out of here?
2374622 2376331 No? Okay.
2376499 2378291 I tried.
2380044 2383463 Captain Reed, thank you so much.
2383631 2385382 Yes. Goodbye. Yes.
2387968 2390095 I don't know<br />what you're trying to do.
2390262 2392263 I don't know why you're here.
2392431 2395225 But you'll never be a cop<br />as long as I live.
2395393 2397185 - Don't want to be.<br />- Get your butt off my desk.
2397353 2399270 And get out of here!
2401190 2402816 Mahoney!
2403859 2405693 I've already told you once.
2405861 2408696 Nobody screws with me.
2409323 2412158 Well, maybe you'll meet the right girl<br />and all that'll change.
2412326 2414786 Get out of here now!
2418457 2421209 Come on, Mahoney.<br />Harris said you had to do a hundred.
2425339 2426631 Hey, Mahoney.
2426799 2429843 Here's a pair of my old sweat socks.<br />I wore them all day.
2430010 2432178 That should help you to get up.
2441188 2442856 You did it.
2443899 2446109 You son of a bitch.
2467131 2469966 This is a hell of a way<br />to spend my evenings.
2472761 2474679 I can't feel my arms anymore.
2479101 2481102 Hey, Barbara, come here.
2481520 2482770 - Me?<br />- Yeah, come here.
2482938 2485315 - What?<br />- Come on, right here.
2487401 2489486 - I want you to give me your best shot.<br />- What?
2489653 2491112 I want you to hit me. Best shot.
2491280 2492614 - Hit you?<br />- Yeah, come on.
2492781 2495283 - Ha, ha. No, really, I...<br />- Hit me.
2495451 2497577 - Really, when I...<br />- Do it now. Come on.
2497745 2500663 - I can't. Because when I...<br />- Do it. Give me your...
2501165 2503541 How was that? Was that okay?
2504418 2505919 Yeah.
2506086 2508171 Yeah, that's good.
2513802 2518139 This weekend is your first leave<br />from the Academy.
2518307 2523353 When you go, wherever it is<br />you filthbags go...
2523521 2527607 do take note of how nice things are<br />on the outside.
2527775 2532153 Do give serious consideration<br />to not coming back.
2532321 2534447 Four of you have already quit.
2534615 2537575 And that's just the beginning.
2538285 2540578 Ten-hut!
2541121 2542163 Dismissed.
2542331 2545625 Heard him, dismissed! Let's go.
2545793 2549587 They'll get together for a party.<br />They always do.
2549755 2551631 You go with them.
2552132 2556052 Whenever they get out of line,<br />give me a ring.
2562017 2564227 Hi, Leslie.
2566105 2567647 Studying hard?
2568148 2569190 Yup.
2569483 2571901 Where's the party going to be<br />this weekend?
2572069 2573486 Party?
2573654 2575780 Party? I don't know anything<br />about a party.
2575948 2578491 I'm going home for the weekend<br />and visit my mom and dad.
2578659 2581953 Now, if you don't mind,<br />I do have to study.
2582121 2585873 You know, Chad?<br />I don't think we've got his full attention.
2586041 2589544 So why don't you take his books<br />and throw them out the window?
2589712 2592505 My pleasure, Kyle.
2602683 2605059 Find out where the party is.
2605227 2608062 - How?<br />- Ask Mahoney.
2608230 2610440 - Mahoney.<br />- Mahoney.
2610608 2614152 Thousand eleven, 1012, 1013...
2615738 2618031 Mahoney.
2618198 2620533 Could I speak to you outside<br />for just a second?
2620701 2622201 Yeah.
2625164 2627081 What's up?
2627249 2629208 Mahoney.
2630794 2632295 Is there a party this weekend?
2632671 2634922 Yeah, of course there is.<br />Do you want to come?
2635090 2637091 No. No, I can't.
2638052 2640762 I just need to know where it is.<br />Sorry to be asking.
2641555 2642847 Then why are you asking?
2643557 2646059 Some people want to know.
2646226 2649729 Okay, yeah. It's no big secret.<br />It's at the Blue Oyster bar.
2649897 2652273 It's on Howell.
2672336 2674379 Hey, big boy<br />Why don't you come up
2674546 2676047 And see me sometime?
2679551 2681511 Hey, big boy
2699530 2702740 So, what about you, Hightower?<br />What are you doing at the Academy?
2702908 2705076 I got bored with my chosen profession.
2705244 2707870 - What was that?<br />- I was a florist.
2708038 2709080 A florist?
2709248 2711958 You know, flowers and shit.
2712793 2714627 Oh, yeah.
2766930 2769515 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
2771810 2775605 - I didn't think you'd show up.<br />- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
2787367 2790286 Do you want to go for a walk?
2790454 2791871 - Walk.<br />- Oh, yeah.
2792039 2794040 Are you kidding? Of course.
2814019 2816187 - Can you tell me something?<br />- Yeah?
2816396 2818648 Why do you want to be a cop?
2822945 2825738 I like to dress like a man.
2827366 2828991 Me too.
2832704 2837834 Tonight you're mine completely
2839670 2845424 You give your love so sweetly
2845843 2852807 Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
2853767 2859605 But will you love me tomorrow?
2860858 2866404 Is this a lasting treasure
2867865 2873828 Or just a moment's pleasure?
2884756 2889552 Okay, let's go. Move it. Move it. Let's go.
2895309 2896601 Two lines, right here.
2896768 2899520 The first one on the step,<br />the second one off.
2902357 2905818 I said two lines, dummy!<br />Now step it up, step it up, let's go.
2905986 2907236 Hey.
2908322 2910656 Why didn't you call me this weekend?
2913327 2916370 Well nothing really happened, sir.
2916538 2919206 There was a party, wasn't there?
2920250 2921751 Yes, sir.
2922336 2923878 Well, what went on?
2926173 2928007 Dancing, sir.
2928467 2929634 Mostly dancing.
2935849 2937099 Dancing?
2941772 2944690 Hightower, you're first. Let's go.
2954993 2956661 Come with me.
2983397 2985231 Ready now, sir.
2989236 2991696 Thank you.
2992698 2994240 I got him.
3001039 3003416 Tackleberry. You're next.
3018432 3019932 Come with me.
3026648 3029692 - Hey!<br />- Tackleberry!
3061767 3063434 Holy shit.
3066188 3068314 Get back here.
3075322 3077531 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
3080327 3083329 - Don't worry, I can explain everything.<br />- Shut up.
3083497 3086999 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
3087167 3088667 Yes, ma'am.
3089211 3092922 You've been sneaking in here<br />every night for weeks.
3093090 3094965 What? No.
3095133 3099053 What do you think<br />I ought to do about this?
3099221 3101889 Well, let's see.
3107354 3108979 My God.
3112067 3113859 Sir.
3115112 3116695 Ma'am.
3127457 3131710 A police officer must generate<br />respect and confidence.
3131878 3134713 His or her voice, Hooks...
3134881 3138592 has a great deal to do with that.<br />Hooks, get up. Stand right over here.
3138760 3140845 Today, Hooks.
3142013 3146016 Now, here is the house.
3146184 3148310 Here is the window.
3148478 3151397 And I am a burglar.
3152023 3154900 I am coming out of the window...
3155068 3158404 with a stolen stereo in my hand.
3158572 3161907 I'm coming out of the window,<br />over the hedge...
3162075 3164326 and you are the arresting officer.
3164494 3166162 What do you say, Hooks?
3166746 3169957 Don't move! This is a stickup.
3171751 3173085 Stickup?
3173253 3176714 I mean, police... Police officer. Stop.
3177507 3180134 Sit down, Hooks.
3180594 3181802 Sit, sit, sit.
3184306 3187474 Tackleberry, you try it. Same situation.
3187851 3191145 All right. Here is the house.<br />Here is the window.
3191313 3195441 I'm the burglar. I'm coming out<br />of the house, over the hedge...
3195609 3197818 I've got the stolen stereo in my hands.
3197986 3202156 Drop that stereo before I blow<br />your goddamn nuts off, asshole!
3206286 3210206 Tackleberry, we really need to talk.
3211124 3213667 Mahoney, let me ask you a question.
3215212 3217838 Have you ever had a woman just...
3218006 3221550 throw you down<br />and screw your goddamn brains out?
3221718 3223052 No.
3223220 3225638 It happened to me last night.
3225805 3228933 Really? How was it?
3229309 3231769 I think...
3233355 3235314 I'm in love.
3238568 3240486 - How many girls were there?<br />- Just one.
3240654 3242196 Just one?
3243323 3246033 You made love to just one girl?
3246201 3247701 That's disgusting.
3247869 3249578 Yeah, I know.
3250997 3254792 - Hey, George, can I ask you something?<br />- Sure.
3256294 3258796 Every now and then...
3258964 3261507 you seem to lose your Spanish accent.
3261675 3263592 What's up?
3263760 3266679 Yeah. Every now and then.
3268640 3270307 Can you keep a secret?
3270475 3271850 Oh, yeah.
3272018 3274728 I'm not really George Martin.
3274896 3279692 I'm just plain old George Martin,<br />fourth-generation American. Ha, ha.
3280068 3282611 - Really?<br />- I just use the accent to get the girls.
3284531 3287116 Does it work?
3291579 3294707 - Barbara!<br />- He's in the gym.
3294874 3297251 You're gonna pay for sending us<br />to the wrong party.
3297419 3300212 - I'll tell him.<br />- Not just pushups, either, Leslie.
3300380 3304049 We're gonna get your fat ass<br />thrown out of here. That's a promise!
3304217 3305759 - How?<br />- How?
3305927 3307052 You'll find out.
3307220 3309805 Mahoney isn't the only one here<br />who can play tricks.
3309973 3312182 Hey, hey. Take it easy.<br />These ain't track shoes.
3312350 3313642 Yeah, I know. Just hurry up.
3313810 3317479 I'm as anxious as you.<br />I'm not comfortable in these surroundings.
3317647 3319606 - Yeah, well, come on up.<br />- Up here?
3319774 3322443 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- Hey, listen, when do I get my money?
3322610 3324570 When the job's over,<br />for crying out loud.
3333955 3337958 That's good, Hightower.<br />Why don't you just sit down over there?
3341463 3344923 All right, you scumballs,<br />30 minutes to room inspection.
3345091 3347926 Move it. Move it. Move it.
3349095 3353057 - Hi, honey.<br />- Hi.
3357228 3360439 Got a light?
3360607 3365277 I don't smoke. Ha, ha.<br />I have a friend who smokes. I'll go get him.
3368281 3370407 Mahoney, major problem.
3375330 3378624 Well, my goodness.
3383880 3388217 Would you please just calm down<br />and take it easy?
3390345 3394264 I just like to do it in strange places,<br />that's all. Okay?
3394432 3395891 Why the hell didn't you say so?
3397143 3400938 You'll find this academy one of the most<br />comprehensive in the country.
3401106 3405651 I could point out many,<br />many, many features to you.
3407153 3409279 - Squeeze in here. Yeah.<br />- In here?
3409447 3411490 - You want to do it in a podium?<br />- All my life.
3411658 3413534 - Right. Where you going?<br />- I'll be back.
3413701 3417621 I'm not the customer. The real customer<br />will be here any second now, okay?
3417789 3419623 Oh, okay.
3419791 3421959 Gentlemen, please follow me.
3422127 3424670 We have a very, very fine...
3424838 3427172 slide presentation for you.
3428341 3430342 Please take your seats.
3430677 3433762 I think you'll find<br />there's plenty of room for everybody.
3434764 3436181 Thank you.
3440854 3443480 First of all, I'd like to say<br />how sorry I am...
3443648 3445899 that everybody could not make it today.
3446067 3450529 For those here, I think you'll find<br />the presentation interesting...
3450697 3453365 as well as very, very stimulating.
3462542 3465210 Could we have the lights turned down?
3466504 3469214 Now, this first slide...
3469841 3471967 shows a very...
3472594 3474303 very interesting thing:
3475221 3477181 Our main building.
3478725 3481894 In slide two...
3484397 3486190 we see...
3487233 3488901 another view...
3489068 3491445 of it.
3492280 3495407 Oh, my God. You wouldn't believe it.
3503500 3507794 Let us look at this slide for a moment,<br />without comment.
3507962 3510214 I think it speaks for itself.
3525355 3527022 Could we have the lights, please?
3531277 3532694 Well.
3533238 3537616 I hope this was as much fun for you<br />as it was for me.
3539786 3542120 Let's have lunch, shall we?
3542789 3546708 And maybe, smoke a cigarette.
3569315 3571066 Good speech.
3601514 3603599 What do you intend to do<br />about Mahoney?
3603766 3605684 - What's he done?<br />- What's he done?
3605852 3609980 I'll tell you what he's done. He...
3613651 3614985 Yes, sir?
3615153 3617362 He did a very, very bad thing.
3618489 3620157 To whom, sir?
3620325 3622242 To whom?
3626205 3627706 Yes, sir.
3628791 3631501 Well, I don't know.
3632629 3634254 Are you all right, sir?
3634422 3637466 No, not really. May I go?
3638426 3640927 - Of course, sir.<br />- Thank you.
3641095 3642846 You're welcome.
3646934 3650228 Left, right, left. Left. Left.
3659530 3661948 Left, right, left. Left.
3675797 3681301 Left, right, left.<br />Left. Left. Left, right, left.
3681469 3686056 From now on, part of your training<br />will be to ride, from time to time...
3686224 3689643 in actual squad cars<br />with actual police officers...
3689811 3691603 in actual situations.
3691771 3694648 And you'd better actually<br />keep your mouths shut.
3694816 3697275 And your eyes and your ears open.
3697443 3701113 Say, Mahoney,<br />why don't you ride with me?
3703533 3708203 Well, move it, cretins!<br />Move it, move it, move it!
3708371 3712290 Lieutenant Harris, I've changed<br />my mind. I want to be a cop.
3712458 3715419 - Never, punk.<br />- Why not? All I have to do is behave...
3715586 3717629 Get out of this car, Mahoney.<br />You hear me?
3717797 3722259 You get. Get, Mahoney.<br />You get out there and you follow me.
3722427 3724970 You stay right behind me, punk.
3731644 3734062 Oh, how I love a ride in the country.
3743906 3745615 Officer. Officer.
3745783 3748618 Can you get my kitty-cat out of the tree?
3750079 3752414 No problem, ma'am.
3752582 3754499 Oh, no. No, wait.
3762175 3764259 What the hell is this?
3771267 3774519 I'll be right back. I'm sorry.
3783529 3785864 What the hell is going on down there?
3786365 3788283 Move it!
3790495 3792370 Assholes.
3792830 3794998 Hey! Hey, you, give me that bike.
3795166 3799461 Come on, move it. This is official<br />police business. Move it out. Let's go.
3799629 3802047 - It's new.<br />- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.
3820691 3822567 My God.
3823361 3825070 Someone call a veterinarian.
3831077 3833245 Your new hat, sir.
3847218 3849261 You told no one?
3849428 3851346 Not a soul.
3913618 3917120 Hightower? Hightower?
3917288 3918538 I need to talk.
3918706 3920749 That's terrific, Hightower, but it's...
3921208 3924419 It's 2:30 in the morning.
3924587 3927672 - The driving course is tomorrow.<br />- So?
3927840 3929633 I haven't driven a car since I was 12.
3929800 3931426 Really? You're kidding.
3931594 3936348 If I don't pass this driving course,<br />they're gonna kick me out. Harris said so.
3939310 3941645 All right. Let's go.
3943064 3945231 Sleeping is for fags.
3945524 3949527 First thing we gotta do is steal a car.<br />Copeland's should do.
3953866 3955784 Okay, your turn.
3955952 3958495 Now, you've got to remember<br />to drive defensively...
3958663 3963208 or offensively, depending<br />on your needs. Let's go.
3971342 3973009 Comfy?
3973552 3974886 - No.<br />- All right.
3975054 3977389 Let's just move the seat back a little.
3977556 3981059 On second thought, let's rip<br />the front seats out and sit in the back.
3996534 3999369 I was kidding about the front seat.<br />But this is good.
3999537 4001871 It's different. Comfort's important.
4005584 4010338 Put it into first. Right. Little more.<br />Okay, you can go a little faster now.
4011424 4016761 Yeah. Yeah, you're doing beautifully.<br />You feel it? You feel what's going on?
4016929 4019556 You can even<br />turn off the windshield wipers.
4020474 4022434 Yeah, that's it.
4023436 4025979 Okay, now there's another car.
4028691 4029858 Hightower?
4031235 4034738 Hightow...? What...?<br />You didn't hit the brakes.
4034905 4037032 You didn't tell me to.
4037199 4038783 You idiot!
4038951 4042078 You bastard! You dumb shit!
4053507 4056384 - Pull over and let me drive for a while.<br />- No, not now.
4056552 4058178 This is fun.
4061015 4063725 - Pull over.<br />- No, I'm getting out of here.
4092088 4093505 Holy shit!
4117655 4118988 Attaboy, Hightower.
4132920 4134379 Taught him everything he knows.
4145349 4148935 Not bad.
4149353 4152063 Miss Hooks, you're next.
4152231 4153398 Hurry up!
4153566 4156067 Thanks, Mahoney. You saved my life.
4156235 4158820 - Maybe someday you'll save mine.<br />- Any time.
4158988 4161156 You're next. Yellow line. Yellow line.
4161699 4164075 You better not cry
4164243 4168746 You better not pout<br />I'm telling you why
4188309 4189934 Wee!
4190102 4191436 Oh, this is fun.
4198235 4200111 What is it? What is it?
4200279 4202238 She ran over my feet.
4202406 4204782 I'm sorry. I really am.
4204950 4208870 Sorry? You dumb, fat jigaboo!
4212208 4214208 Oh, shit.
4220966 4223301 - At ease, Hightower. At ease.<br />- It's okay, Hightower.
4223469 4226846 - He didn't mean it. He was joking.<br />- Take it easy, now. Hightower!
4227014 4228514 Hightower, don't do that.
4228682 4233811 If you don't stop, you are out of here.<br />I am warning you, Hightower!
4243989 4246824 You messed up big, mister.
4246992 4251329 Now you get your stuff<br />and get out of here, right now.
4252331 4253623 Get!
4257002 4259545 Attention,<br />applications for motorcycle service...
4259713 4263049 should be turned in<br />at the Administration building by Friday.
4263217 4265927 Applications for motorcycle service<br />should be turned in...
4266095 4269097 One down, several to go.
4276480 4278940 Copeland, get out of that car.
4288117 4289701 Mahoney.
4292162 4293997 It's got to be Mahoney.
4295874 4299627 I know, I know. Come on.
4303799 4307343 Out of all the people I thought would<br />make it, Hightower was the one.
4307845 4311222 I mean, if all the cops looked like him,<br />there'd be no crime at all.
4312349 4314058 I'm getting sick of this place.
4314226 4317061 How're you doing, "Ma-homo"?
4317479 4319230 Don't fool with me.<br />Not in the mood.
4319398 4320898 You wrecked my car.
4321066 4324736 No, Hightower did. Why don't you<br />go see him? That'd be a matchup.
4324903 4327030 Because we want you.
4327656 4331075 Okay, how about 12:00 midnight?<br />Nine o'clock on the coast.
4331243 4335621 No, no. I'm talking right now, Mahoney.<br />Let's go. You throw the first punch.
4335998 4337332 Cadet could get thrown out...
4337499 4340001 - For hitting another cadet.<br />- Oh, really?
4340544 4343212 I thought you wanted to get thrown out.
4343380 4345256 Here's your chance.
4347509 4348968 No.
4350387 4354599 Now, Mahoney, I'm going to rub this<br />right in your face.
4354767 4356351 On your mark...
4356518 4358394 get set...
4370616 4373201 - Wait, you guys! Wait!<br />- What the hell...?
4373369 4376162 Who threw the first punch?
4376330 4378748 - That's all I want to know.<br />- Barbara did.
4378916 4381584 - Barbara?<br />- That's right, sir.
4382628 4385671 Then he's out of here.<br />Him and his queer dog.
4385839 4389133 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />Barbara didn't throw the first punch.
4389301 4390802 - He did so.<br />- I threw the punch.
4390969 4393179 Mahoney, you're out<br />of your mind. Lieutenant...
4393347 4397433 - Blankes, who'd you rather have out?<br />- Is that true, Blankes?
4399144 4401521 Did Mahoney start it?
4404233 4406984 Yes, sir. Mahoney started it.
4408112 4412031 Then, Mahoney, my little piss-ant...
4412950 4415868 you are out of the Academy...
4416370 4417995 forever.
4419873 4421707 Get your stuff.
4422918 4424252 And get out.
4424420 4427004 Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.
4441687 4443855 Does the radio bother you?
4447025 4449068 I could turn it down.
4456368 4458453 Here, I brought you an apple.
4460122 4461414 Thanks.
4467212 4468838 Hey, man, what...?
4489693 4492403 My God. Here, take this.
4492571 4495156 Hey, free TV's.
4500370 4503372 Hey, everybody! There's a riot going on.
4508962 4511839 My livelihood! You're ruining me!
4512007 4514926 What do you got there?<br />What are you doing with that TV?
4521934 4524560 - Hi. Want a ride?<br />- No, thanks.
4539284 4540826 Hey, did you two hear the news...
4540994 4542495 - On the radio?<br />- No.
4542663 4545623 - A riot's broken out downtown.<br />- How come?
4545791 4547583 Who knows how these things<br />get started?
4547751 4550002 Attention! All cadets report immediately...
4550170 4551796 to the parking lot in full riot gear.
4551964 4555967 Repeat, all cadets report immediately<br />to the parking lot in full riot gear.
4556134 4557301 This is not a drill.
4557469 4560304 - Jones! Was that you?<br />- No, man.
4561056 4564058 Let's go, let's go, let's go!
4564226 4568938 Get out there fast!<br />Move it, move it, move it!
4569648 4571107 Let's go, let's go.
4584746 4588541 This is it. This is the big one.
4589293 4591043 It's time this cop...
4591211 4593379 met the public.
4599177 4602847 All right, listen up.<br />Here's the situation. There is a state...
4603015 4606225 of general disorder<br />in the Oakfield section of town.
4606393 4608519 Real police are handling the problem.
4608687 4611856 We are being sent<br />to a peripheral safe area.
4612024 4615860 Our job will be merely to divert traffic<br />away from the trouble zone...
4616028 4618321 and to protect public property.
4618488 4620114 You will have live ammunition...
4620282 4622199 but there will be no call to use it.
4622367 4626203 Tackleberry, do you understand,<br />numb nuts?
4626371 4627913 Yes, sir.
4635756 4637548 Come on!
4642220 4644847 We are now entering<br />the expressway at Belmont.
4645432 4648392 Very good. Your bus is to deploy<br />on Sixteenth Street...
4648560 4650519 between 4th and 8th Avenues.
4650687 4653022 Sixteenth Street? Are you sure, sir?
4653190 4655650 Of course I'm sure.<br />I never forget a number.
4656985 4658277 Yes, sir.
4658445 4660363 There's nobody around.
4661323 4663908 I guess they're hiding.
4676213 4679382 All right, let's go, dirtbags, unload it.<br />Let's move it.
4679549 4682301 I want two lines right here.<br />Come on, dummies.
4682469 4685846 Let's go, let's go.
4689518 4691769 You, one block over, one block up.
4691937 4694146 You, one block down.
4695399 4698651 You, one block up. You, one block over.
4698819 4703114 You, one block over. Let's go. Let's go.
4703281 4705491 If you have to make an arrest...
4705659 4708285 do it as quietly as possible.
4710831 4713290 Boy, it sure is quiet around here?
4728974 4731308 Hey, Fackler. How's it going?
4731476 4733352 Oh, just fine, thanks.
4736148 4739316 - What the hell are you doing here?<br />- We're from the Academy.
4739484 4743404 You're supposed to be blocks away.<br />The damn riot's right down this street.
4743572 4745448 We're pulling out.
4747701 4751746 I love sushi. I'm into back-rubs,<br />all kinds of Japanese stuff.
4751913 4754165 My car stereo, it's a Sony.
4754332 4757585 I got a good friend, his father was killed<br />at Pearl Harbor.
4757753 4761505 Hey, maybe your family had<br />something to do with it?
4761673 4763507 You know sake? The wine?
4763675 4767553 I know a place where they heat it up<br />before they serve it.
4768472 4770097 Holy shit.
4770265 4772516 I got to go now.
4781067 4782818 Run!
4811515 4815351 Hello, men. I thought I'd come by<br />for a personal inspection.
4816394 4818479 - Okay if we get in, sir?<br />- I guess so.
4818647 4821732 Sure, why not?<br />Well, men, how's it going?
4821900 4824819 I want you to give me a fix<br />on the entire situation.
4824986 4826612 Not that good, sir.
4827072 4830658 Oh, so this is very, very, very bad.
4831785 4833911 The main thing is not to panic.
4839584 4841961 Attention! Attention, everybody.
4842128 4847258 Attention. This is Commandant<br />Eric Lassard of the Police Academy.
4847425 4850636 If you do not disperse immediately,<br />my men will have to arrest you.
4850804 4856767 You have five seconds to move away.<br />Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
4859980 4861272 Give me the thing.
4897309 4899602 You should park cars for a living, sir.
4906902 4908402 Anybody want any of this?
4908570 4910237 You want this? You'd die for this.
4910405 4912406 - You're not so tough now.<br />- Come and take it.
4912574 4914909 - How about you? You want this?<br />- What's the matter?
4915076 4919288 - I'm talking to you, twerp.<br />- Just too dumb to talk?
4947192 4949985 Damn it. Look, in here.
4952489 4954073 Try this one.
4961373 4965918 Help. Help.<br />This is Cadet Leslie Barbara. Help.
4966086 4969129 Barbara, this is Lt. Harris.
4969297 4970547 Just calm down.
4971549 4973926 I'm being chased by 30 rioters.
4975512 4977554 Barbara, just tell me where you are.
4977722 4979848 I'm passing you now, sir.
4984521 4986647 Holy shit.
4992904 4994071 Hi.
4998827 5001036 Get the cops!
5022600 5025352 Okay. Hold it right there, guys.
5025520 5027438 Why, if it isn't Leslie Barbara...
5027605 5030107 - The police officer.<br />- Yeah.
5030900 5033152 Come on, Les,<br />you're not going to shoot us.
5033319 5036405 You wouldn't shoot old friends,<br />would you?
5041953 5043537 No.
5044456 5045956 Les.
5046958 5049209 Get lost. We're busy.
5066811 5071607 Now, get the furniture back up there<br />and get out of the area.
5072150 5074359 But it's our furniture.
5078239 5079531 Sorry.
5091669 5094463 Callahan calling Harris. Come in, please.
5094631 5096215 Harris, come in.
5099219 5100594 Where the hell is Harris?
5100762 5102846 - I don't know.<br />- What?
5103014 5105099 - She doesn't know.<br />- I heard her.
5108186 5109728 Run!
5119531 5121073 Why don't you shoot back?
5125870 5127955 - Are those gunshots?<br />- Fucking A.
5130166 5132751 Shoot back. Come on.
5134671 5137339 Look up there. See? See?
5137507 5139842 That looks like Harris up there.
5140009 5141844 Should we shoot back?
5148726 5150435 I don't think so.
5154232 5155774 Come on!
5158528 5159862 Stay there.
5161072 5162531 Mahoney!
5163074 5165450 Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
5166953 5169788 I'll bet there's a back door to this place.
5169956 5173167 Hooks. Hooks!<br />Hooks, get the hell back here.
5173334 5175210 That's an order.
5229015 5230474 Freeze!
5231851 5233810 Oh, shit.
5260838 5262506 Don't move, you bastard.
5262674 5265801 Run, Thompson! Run!
5267887 5268929 Put the gun down.
5270348 5272432 Let's say you put your gun down.
5275853 5279773 Lieutenant Harris, any last-minute<br />tips or suggestions?
5282151 5283902 Nothing really comes to mind.
5286489 5288073 What's it gonna be?
5292161 5294204 Throw your gun over the ledge.
5296541 5298292 I got two piglet-wigglets.
5300670 5302379 Hey!
5302880 5304214 What do you want?
5305174 5307467 I want to watch you off these pigs.
5313641 5316226 Sure. Ha, ha. Sure.
5323860 5325819 Which one do we do first?
5334454 5336288 I believe I'd shoot this one.
5336456 5337706 Yeah, the old one.
5346924 5351553 - Looks like cadet revolvers to me.<br />- I know those guys.
5355600 5358643 Don't move, dirtbag!
5384962 5387172 Hey. Aw. Hey, hey.
5387340 5389424 - Hey, hey, hey.<br />- What's wrong with this man?
5389592 5392260 There was gunplay, sir, and he missed it.
5403439 5407025 - Lieutenant Harris? Captain Reed.<br />- Nice to meet you, sir.
5407193 5410320 Thank you. I also want to thank you<br />for looking out for Mahoney.
5410488 5412906 It was an honor and a pleasure, sir.
5413074 5415117 Thank you, sir. Ha, ha.
5421958 5424000 - Could you just...?<br />- This woman bothering you?
5424168 5427212 What? No. This is my mother.
5428464 5430799 Ten-four. Carry on.
5430967 5432759 - Oh, my precious...<br />- Mom, would...?
5433136 5435303 - Then at 8:00 you'll meet my mother.<br />- Right.
5435471 5438014 - You'd better have some flowers.<br />- Flowers, check.
5441978 5443437 You men, stop that.
5447775 5449734 Oh, well, ha, ha.
5449902 5451570 That's more like it, Mahoney.
5452363 5454739 Good man. Keep up the good work.
5455408 5456867 Thank you, sir.
