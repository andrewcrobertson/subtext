120205 121498 Hello...
122374 124043 Tackleberry.
128380 130631 We're all gonna miss you around here.
130632 133635 The Police Academy's getting itself<br />a real fine recruit.
136430 138182 May I, uh...
138557 140101 go now?
141393 142895 Affirmative, sir.
144605 146313 Ten-four.
146314 149526 Yes, of course. Ten-four.
227646 228981 You guys.
230691 231900 Surprise.
235821 237281 Lot's full, mister.
238991 241826 Look, don't give me that crap.
241827 244912 - You've got a space.<br />- The lot's full, sir, really.
244913 247166 Find a spot, dickhead.
247916 250501 - Dickhead?<br />- That's right. Where's the manager?
250502 251836 Dickhead?
251837 254088 Park the car, butt breath.
254089 256258 - Butt breath?<br />- Yeah.
257259 260594 Wait a minute. Hold everything.<br />That's a wig, isn't it?
260595 262972 - Ahem. Park the car.<br />- Yeah, that's a wig.
262973 265558 Wig! Wig! Dong-dong-dong!
265559 268519 - Wig alert! Wig alert! Dong-dong-dong!<br />- Park the car, asshole. Shut up.
268520 270314 Girls. It's a rug.
271023 273067 What the hell's going on here? Hi, Lou.
273692 276903 - Lou?<br />- This rude little punk won't park my car.
276904 278779 Mahoney, park this car.
278780 280281 If you can find a spot...
280282 283617 Do it now or you're fired.<br />You understand? Fired.
283618 287080 Fired? That's not fair,<br />the guy has a bad attitude.
287081 288664 Do it, okay?
288665 292544 I want you to apologize to this man,<br />then park his car.
294588 296298 Yes, sir.
298383 300801 - I'm sorry.<br />- Get out of here.
300802 302887 And clean the ashtray while you're at it.
309019 312189 Yeah, I'm sorry, Lou. You just can't get<br />good help these days.
314233 316817 Respect for anything.<br />They don't respect customers.
316818 319862 They don't respect property.<br />They don't respect respect.
321240 323575 Holy shit. Jesus.
330291 333334 It fits. Damn thing fits.
333335 336755 I thought there were no more spaces.<br />Am I an idiot or what?
343428 344637 Hi, fellas.
353688 354731 Hey, guys, just...
355816 357276 Hey, hey!
373208 375752 Guys, I don't think I'm supposed<br />to get the photos wet.
385095 388681 You're going to pay for this.<br />Mark my words.
388682 391810 And you want to know why? Huh?
396148 399901 I'll let you know why. It's no secret.<br />Everybody knows.
399902 402404 I'm joining the police force. Ha, ha!
402405 404739 What do you think of that, huh? Huh?
404740 406366 Now who's in charge?
413665 416084 Hey, sarge, it's him again.
416085 418711 I'll call Captain Reed.<br />Sit over there, Mahoney.
418712 420381 All right, let's go.
425302 427554 Sit. And stay there.
438607 441568 - What are you in for?<br /><i>- I'll</i> show you.
446656 448783 Goddamn it! Stop that!
448784 450410 Oh, no, sir. No, not you.
450411 452162 That's terrific. Really.
452746 456624 - What's your name?<br />- Jones. Larvell Jones.
456625 459210 Monsignor Larvell Jones.
459211 460462 M.D.
460463 462755 - Let's go, Mahoney.<br />- See you around, monsignor.
462756 465134 Doctor monsignor.
475685 478481 Why can't you stay out of trouble?
478814 480274 I mean...
481691 484819 What's wrong with you?<br />Last week: disturbing the peace.
484820 488656 Week before that:<br />destroying private property.
488657 492328 And I'm getting tired of saving your butt.
493578 496290 I only do it because of your father.
497707 500793 - He was a good friend.<br />- Yeah, I know.
500794 503505 Now, Mahoney, I've made a decision.
503506 506048 I ain't gonna help you this time.
506049 508927 You're going to the county lockup.
509594 511137 - Lockup?<br />- Mm-hm.
511138 515266 Why? I didn't do anything really major.
515267 518227 - Then I'll make a deal with you.<br />- Anything.
518228 521230 I want you to go to the Police Academy.
521231 523191 The Police Academy?
523192 526402 Even if you never graduate,<br />the training will be good for you.
526403 528112 Wait a minute.
528113 530239 Wait a minute. Reed?
530240 533785 Listen, you've seen the commercials<br />on TV.
534119 537747 The Academy's taking<br />all kinds these days.
538541 540543 Anybody can get in.
541626 542961 Even you.
543295 545629 No deal. That's nuts.
545630 548384 Well, it's either that or the lockup.
548800 552387 - Police Academy or jail.<br />- Will I get my own squad car?
552388 556224 You'll get 14 weeks of Academy training<br />and discipline...
556225 559477 - starting Monday morning.<br />- Fourteen weeks.
559478 561854 Oh, they can throw you out.
561855 564940 But you can't quit.<br />You quit, and you're back in jail.
564941 567027 That's the deal.
567528 569695 - Can I bring a friend?<br />- Who?
569696 571823 Monsignor Larvell Jones,<br />my personal physician.
573033 574826 You decide.
575994 579330 Honey, please don't go. I love you.<br />I don't want to see you hurt.
579331 581749 I worry about you.<br />You're so accident-prone.
581750 584377 And the Police Academy<br />is such a dangerous place.
584378 587963 - Honey, don't worry. I'll be okay.<br />- Unh!
587964 589507 Everything'll be okay.
589508 592051 You start that car<br />and you're a dead man, buster.
592052 593595 Honey, I'm late.
593596 597933 You pull out of that driveway<br />and I'll have your head on a pole.
600143 603021 Come back here, you turkey!
633385 637431 You move this car an inch<br />and you're finished, mister. You hear me?
645063 649651 Of all the things that you could be<br />in this world, why a policeman?
649652 652821 A policewoman, mother.
654198 655406 But Why?
655407 657741 Because it's exciting, it's different.
657742 660495 It'll give me a chance to meet<br />interesting and unusual people.
660496 662664 right now! If you don't pull over...
662665 665250 People who aren't like you and me.
709086 711879 - Hey, look, it's the chief.<br />- Really?
711880 713549 Hey, mention my name.
718637 720846 Cadet Kyle Blankes<br />reporting for duty, sir.
720847 723140 Get away from me, you asshole.
723141 724476 Yes, sir.
742911 746206 - Where are we, man?<br />- Ecuador
750001 754714 Okay! Oh, here we are.<br />I got to go now. Bye.
754715 758050 - Bye, sweet-pea. Bye, cutie-pie.<br />- We'll miss you.
758051 760595 - Okay.<br />- Bye!
760596 764307 Okay, girls. Remember, I love yous.
764308 767268 - Bye!<br />- lntroduce yourself around, man.
770021 773567 Bye! Bye, babies. Goodbye.
774943 776152 Hey, excuse me.
776153 777945 - Do you know all those women?<br />- Sure.
777946 779863 - They're my girlfriends.<br />- All of them?
779864 781825 - Yeah.<br />- Carey Mahoney.
781826 783493 I'm George Martin, Carey.
783494 785829 We should be pals.<br />You're an interesting guy.
785830 787455 You a cadet?
787456 789749 I am until I can get myself<br />thrown out of here.
789750 790958 I'll be gone by 10:00.
790959 793628 You, like, joined the Academy<br />to get thrown out?
793629 794838 That's right.
794839 797591 Hey, you're a pretty interesting guy<br />yourself.
806891 808769 Look at that.
809311 811730 Just look at that.
812230 816108 Look at that scum.<br />When I went through this academy...
816109 819153 every cadet was the right weight,<br />the right height, color...
819154 821865 and they all had Johnsons, Lassard.
821866 824200 Every single one of them.
824201 825409 Johnsons?
825410 827663 You know...
828997 830582 Oh, yes.
831416 835795 Back in the old days, there were Johnsons<br />as far as the eye could see.
835796 838674 And what a lovely sight it was.
839842 842010 Have you seen these applications?
843762 847557 Have you seen what our new lady mayor<br />has brought us?
847558 849851 Do you know she is attempting<br />to dismantle...
849852 853437 one of this country's great institutions<br />of law and order?
853438 855858 What do you say to that, Lassard?
856441 858026 The bitch.
858903 861404 - Commandant?<br />- Yes, chief.
861405 865199 The mayor says we've got<br />to take this flotsam.
865200 869036 But that doesn't mean<br />we have to put them on the force.
869037 870996 You get my drift?
870997 874709 Weed the undesirables out.
874710 877378 - Get rid of them.<br />- No problem, chief.
877379 879464 We'll start washing them out<br />this morning.
879465 881340 We don't throw them out.
881341 884844 They must be encouraged to quit<br />on their own.
884845 889014 - Do you understand?<br />- I think I understand, sir.
889015 892519 Thank you, Lieutenant Harris,<br />I'm sure you do.
893771 895314 - Lassard?<br />- What?
895981 897816 Do you understand?
897817 900985 - It's clear as glass, chief.<br />- Good.
900986 903863 Then we all know what to do.
929890 931642 That's it...
933018 935729 There sure are a lot<br />of spades around here.
943362 945530 Which I think is good.
945531 947866 Very good for the Academy.
947867 950577 What the hell are you doing here?
951453 953997 I want to be a police officer.
953998 957960 What? I can't hear you.
958711 962464 I want to be a police officer.
964550 967426 - Don't unpack.<br />- Well...
967427 969304 time to get thrown out.
970305 973225 Princess. Princess! Prin...!
975060 977311 - What's your name, Cadet?<br />- Thompson, sir.
977312 979104 - You live around here?<br />- No, sir.
979105 981190 What's your telephone number,<br />Thompson?
981191 983651 Come on, eyes front. Telephone number.
983652 986153 5-5-52-4-6-7, sir.
986154 989240 Okay, let's see the thighs.
989241 993328 Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.<br />The thighs.
994955 998249 - What in the hell are you doing?<br />- Meeting women, sir.
998250 1000877 What's your name, dirtbag?
1000878 1003128 - Dirtbag?<br />- Your name?
1003129 1004964 Mahoney, sir.
1004965 1006382 Back in line, Mahoney.
1006383 1009802 Sir, can I have a second with you?<br />Um, listen. Uh...
1009803 1012055 I don't really belong here.<br />I'm not right for this.
1012056 1016643 Get back in line.
1017770 1019687 Now!
1021023 1024358 Mom, it's all right. Don't worry.<br />Come here, Princess.
1054890 1059061 My name is Commandant Lassard.<br />Welcome to the new police force.
1059812 1062355 Your training time here will last...
1063565 1065232 <i>Fourteen.</i>
1065233 1067359 fourteen weeks.
1067360 1071823 You will be schooled in firearms,<br />police procedures, local laws...
1071824 1073866 and many, many other things.
1073867 1077411 After those 12 weeks,<br />some of you will be police officers...
1077412 1079163 and some of you will not.
1079164 1080581 Some of you will be...
1082250 1083794 Here at the Academy...
1085087 1087046 Here at the Academy...
1087047 1089007 you will learn...
1089008 1090634 You will learn...
1091677 1093344 Princess. Princess. Come here.
1093345 1095639 Princess?<br />Looks more like a prince to me.
1097599 1100559 - Give me that dog.<br />- Uh... Ahem. But he's mine, sir.
1100560 1101936 He's a queer.
1101937 1106691 Cadets, proceed to the supply room<br />and draw your uniforms.
1106692 1110821 Fall out. Let's go. Move it.<br />Move it, move it, move it.
1115951 1118911 - Next.<br />- What about guns? When do we get guns?
1118912 1120413 Next.
1121373 1124459 - I'm a size 9, sometimes a size 10.<br />- Next.
1132885 1136679 Hey! You three dirtbags report<br />to the Academy barber...
1136680 1138347 before you do anything else.
1138348 1139933 Where's that?
1139934 1142518 Find it, rat face.
1142519 1144062 Rat face?
1144063 1147148 - He probably meant the other guy.<br />- Oh. Oh, okay.
1147149 1149400 - What's that?<br />- That's where the commandant...
1149401 1151652 - and his wife live.<br />- Nice.
1151653 1154238 Oh. Excuse me.<br />Do you know where we get our clothes?
1154239 1157491 Yeah. You gotta go right over there.
1157492 1159160 - Here? Okay, thanks.<br />- Mm-hm.
1159161 1162206 - Go in and tell them Mahoney sent you.<br />- Got it.
1162664 1166250 - Be out of here by 3:00.<br />- Move it, dirtbag. I'm first.
1166251 1168336 And I'm next.
1169213 1172883 For important guys like you, I'll wait.
1176303 1179346 Okay, let's go. Take it all off.
1179347 1180723 You got it.
1197158 1198407 Hello?
1227062 1232566 - Ah. Just a little off the side, please.<br />- You bet.
1232567 1236905 - You can do that?<br />- Sure. This ain't the Army, you know.
1241076 1246080 Let's go, let's go! We've got to find<br />you little babies a place to sleep.
1246081 1248958 Better listen up, you fart-blossoms.
1248959 1252962 - You sure you said Mahoney?<br />- Yeah, I even spelled it to her.
1252963 1254839 - Copeland and Blankes, in here.<br />- Sir.
1254840 1257925 This man is my personal physician.<br />I can't live without him, sir.
1257926 1260845 Right down here,<br />I want Fackler and Martin.
1260846 1262596 I've known him since childhood...
1262597 1267394 - Right here, Mahoney and Tackleberry.<br />- Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!
1269563 1271689 Thank you.<br />I've always wanted to live with a nut.
1271690 1273942 My pleasure.
1274401 1277111 - Mahoney, is it?<br />- Yes, sir. I'd like to say one more...
1277112 1281282 The rest of you wimps come with me.<br />Move it, move it, move it.
1281283 1282576 Wimps?
1287164 1289499 - You're married, huh?<br />- Yeah.
1290209 1292126 That's beautiful, man.
1292127 1294296 To me, marriage is a sacred institution.
1295339 1296964 So tell me.
1296965 1299676 You and the wife do it doggie-style<br />or what?
1316568 1318862 Room ready for inspection, sir.
1320697 1322240 Good haircuts, men.
1322241 1324118 - Thank you, sir.<br />- Thank you, sir.
1324826 1326660 Damn good haircuts.
1326661 1328413 - Thank you, sir.<br />- Thank you, sir.
1334836 1336503 Men...
1336504 1338715 I've got a little problem.
1339216 1342969 It seems I've got a squad<br />full of scumbuckets.
1342970 1345139 A whole big bunch of losers.
1345806 1349226 And I was kind of hoping<br />that you two fine, young cadets...
1350060 1353021 might help me to just get rid of<br />a few of them.
1353563 1357484 What do you say?<br />Will you help me out?
1358777 1361529 - Yes, sir.<br />- Good.
1363657 1367744 - Good.<br />- I'm Copeland, sir. Chad Copeland.
1368620 1370247 Good for you.
1373334 1376420 Hi, I'm Douglas Fackler.<br />I always wanted to be a cop.
1392811 1395271 <i>Lieutenant Hoffman, Lieutenant Hoffman...</i>
1395272 1397358 <i>report immediately to the infirmary.</i>
1397900 1400068 Hey, Thompson. Well?
1400069 1402904 - How do I look?<br />- That wasn't very funny this morning.
1402905 1405573 Wasn't funny.<br />I'd give anything to see your thighs.
1405574 1407825 Don't suppose you'd<br />describe them for me.
1407826 1412538 Well, they're tan, of course.<br />Very supple, well-rounded...
1412539 1415583 and luxuriant to the touch.
1415584 1416834 <i>Mm.</i>
1416835 1419671 Absolute silence!
1424885 1429431 My name is Lt. Harris...
1429432 1431808 in case you missed it.
1435729 1439315 This is Sgt. Callahan...
1439316 1441650 in case you missed it.
1441651 1445947 We are the meanest instructors here.
1445948 1451870 We've got you because<br />you are the worst people here.
1453872 1456832 You people are D-Squad.
1456833 1459543 D for dirtbags.
1459544 1464632 When I say, "Hey, dirtbags,"<br />that means you.
1464633 1469304 You people are going to hate my guts<br />for the rest of your lives.
1469305 1474393 I am going to make you sorry<br />that you ever came here.
1474768 1478729 Now, it is traditional here at the Academy<br />for each squad...
1478730 1481274 to have two student squad-leaders.
1481275 1486113 I have chosen Cadets Blankes<br />and Dopeland. Step out, men.
1486822 1490326 If these two cadets give you an order...
1490909 1494163 obey it.
1495872 1499501 Now, I thought it would be nice...
1499502 1503546 if we were to close out<br />our first afternoon together...
1503547 1507759 with a nice little stroll<br />around the campus.
1512931 1516435 Move out, maggots!
1522941 1527029 - Holy, shit.<br />- This is definitely not Ecuador.
1530907 1533201 Get up, Barbara. Get up. Get up.
1533202 1534869 Move it, move it, move it.
1534870 1538498 I could show a movie on your butt, fatso.
1538499 1541167 Nineteen. Twenty!
1542961 1547173 More! I want more!
1547174 1549800 Fifteen.
1549801 1552011 Sixteen.
1552012 1554389 Seventeen.
1554390 1559352 Eighteen. Let's go. Let's go.
1559353 1563566 Nine. Ten.
1566443 1569778 <i>Attention. Lights out in 10 minutes.</i>
1569779 1572907 <i>Lights out in 10 minutes.</i>
1606691 1609152 Game over.
1618787 1620747 Asshole.
1620997 1624917 Police work...
1624918 1628129 is what...
1628130 1630465 you are...
1630466 1634470 here for.
1635262 1638431 Arrest...
1638432 1643102 procedures...
1643103 1647815 traffic violations...
1647816 1650276 “high-speed...
1650277 1652612 driving...
1652613 1654864 self-defense.
1654865 1660786 And you will have many examinations...
1660787 1664333 which you must pass.
1665000 1666585 Plus...
1667085 1671631 you will endure an extremely rigorous<br />physical training program.
1671632 1674677 Do you know what that means, Hooks?
1675969 1678471 I'm not sure, sir.
1678472 1680264 What?
1682601 1685061 Voice commands.
1685062 1689190 We will learn to use our voices<br />with authority.
1689191 1691193 Won't we, Hooks?
1694530 1699868 Now, have any of you<br />had any military training?
1702871 1704038 Mm-hm?
1704039 1708377 I served with the U.S. Army<br />Airborne 209th Special Forces Unit.
1708753 1710336 Anybody else?
1710337 1711630 What?
1712339 1716092 You have had prior<br />military training, Mahoney?
1716093 1719429 - Well, yes, but not in this life, sir.<br />- What?
1719430 1722640 In a previous life, I served<br />with Her Majesty's Forces in India.
1722641 1726477 - Interesting sideline...<br />- If you're trying to get thrown out...
1726478 1728812 I'm afraid that's quite impossible.
1728813 1731357 Impossible?<br />What the hell's going on here?
1731358 1733526 I'll have to see<br />the commandant about this.
1733527 1739700 You will also learn the Municipal Code.<br />And you will learn them by heart.
1740284 1741867 <i>Cadet Mahoney. Cadet Mahoney.</i>
1741868 1745789 <i>Report immediately to the commandant's<br />office. Cadet Mahoney.</i>
1745790 1751754 Okay, Mahoney, get going. On the double.<br />Move it. Move it. Move it.

1770731 1773232 - No one's allowed in here.<br />- Listen.
1773233 1775777 - I got a problem, chief.<br />- It's commandant.
1775778 1778780 Commandant, I'm sorry.<br />ls that your fish?
1778781 1781073 - No, it belongs to a friend.<br />- Very pretty.
1781074 1783867 - What do you want?<br />- I want out of here. Right now.
1783868 1787163 - Out of this office?<br />- No, out of the Academy.
1787164 1790249 - That's no problem. You can just quit.<br />- I can't quit.

1808560 1811521 - You're a special case. You can't quit.<br />- I know that.
1811522 1814816 - On the other hand, I can't throw you out.<br />- Why not?
1814817 1818821 I promised Capt. Reed. I promised<br />I'd keep you here the full 24 weeks.
1819613 1823282 You what? You what? You told...?
1823283 1825870 He told me that I could...
1827996 1831667 - I'm trapped here?<br />- Well, yes. We all are.
1833377 1836296 Pick it up, pick it up.<br />Keep moving up that hill.
1838590 1840174 Put some muscle in it.
1840175 1843011 Get those knees up.<br />Get those knees up, come on!
1854690 1856232 Hustle, hustle, hustle!
1856233 1858068 This is definitely not for me.
1863866 1864949 Keep going!
1877797 1882885 Come on, Hooks, get over the wall.<br />Move it, move it, move it.
1883677 1886930 Come on, Hooks, get up.
1886931 1891100 Skip it. Go around. You'll never make it.<br />Why don't you quit now?
1891101 1894186 Quit, quit, quit. You'll never make it.
1894187 1899234 Sir, I'm terribly sorry,<br />but I seem to have ripped my pants.
1904406 1906450 Don't try me, punk.
1907701 1910035 Now, wise guy...
1910036 1912288 you run, don't trot...
1912289 1916627 to the supply room,<br />and you get a new pair.
1917294 1919879 Yes, sir. I'll be back later in the day.
1919880 1923424 Be back in five minutes!
1923425 1926261 Yes, sir. Shit, I'm deaf.
1937397 1939607 Hey, you got any brown shoe-polish?
1939608 1941359 I've got cordovan. Who's it for?
1941360 1943278 Lieutenant Harris.

1985946 1988865 So far, nobody's quit.
1988866 1989950 But they will.
2013849 2016226 Well, well, well.
2017102 2020188 I told you not to try me, boy.
2021356 2022858 Stand up.
2024944 2027904 Now, I want you two squad leaders...
2027905 2031198 to take Mr. Mahoney here<br />and run him until he throws up.
2031199 2032408 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, sir.
2032409 2035787 And then, just after he throws up...

2037289 2038999 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, sir.
2041585 2044463 You are going to learn, Mahoney...
2044880 2046882 that nobody...

2063816 2067193 - Sure.<br />- Come on, Mahoney! Move it, move it!
2116910 2118453 Bang!
2128589 2132216 Son, where did you get this gun?
2132217 2135261 - My mom gave it to me.<br />- Ah.
2135262 2138222 Can I borrow it for a little while?
2138223 2140101 Sure.
2141643 2147149 Left, left right left.<br />Left, left, left right left.
2147900 2153989 You will learn to defend yourselves<br />without stick or firearm.
2155116 2156824 I need a volunteer.
2156825 2160078 - Barbara, get out here.<br />- I just ate.
2160079 2164208 Right where I'm standing.<br />Right here. Right now.
2166794 2169796 All right, come at me<br />with an imaginary knife.
2169797 2171172 Do I have to?
2171173 2174842 Yes, you do. I'm not joking.
2174843 2177762 Come on. Come on.
2177763 2180723 - Now!<br />- Aah!
2180724 2182977 Ouch! Ouch!
2186897 2190733 Okay. That's how it's done. Who's next?
2190734 2193027 - Pick me!<br />- I'd love it. I'd love to go.
2193028 2195280 I'd love to go. We'll both go.
2195530 2197865 You have 20 minutes<br />to complete the test.
2197866 2201244 Try to answer as many questions<br />as possible.
2201245 2203622 All right, start.
2214549 2218595 <i>All right, here we go.<br />The count's at two. Here's the pitch.</i>
2219054 2220638 <i>Swung on and missed!</i>
2222224 2223934 <i>Struck out.</i>
2237906 2242076 <i>Well, it was Saturday night<br />And I was feeling all right</i>
2242077 2243912 <i>Looking for my buttercup</i>
2245039 2249000 <i>They were dancing next door<br />On the thirteenth floor</i>
2286413 2287997 You know, Mahoney...
2287998 2292460 I'd like to spend the next month<br />breaking you into little pieces.
2293420 2295255 But I won't...
2295256 2297464 because you're bad.
2297465 2299968 You're bad for morale, Mahoney.
2300719 2303888 You look like the sweet little boy<br />from next door.
2303889 2306266 Ha. But you don't fool me. Oh, no.
2306267 2309810 No, you're the devil,<br />and you're rotten to the core.
2309811 2311645 And you're ruining my chances...
2311646 2314732 of training some men<br />who might make pretty good cops.
2314733 2316483 I agree. I've been saying that.
2316484 2319737 - You make me sick.<br />- Thank you, sir. I make everybody sick.
2319738 2323657 We're going to pick up this telephone<br />and call your buddy Capt. Reed.
2323658 2328163 And you. You are going to help me<br />talk him out of this terrible mistake.
2328830 2330331 Terrific. I'll do my part.
2330332 2332459 You're damn right you will.
2334962 2336338 Ha.
2339841 2343971 This is the Academy.<br />I'd like to speak to a Capt. Reed.
2344888 2347015 Reed!
2350644 2354147 Captain Reed? Uh, yes, sir.<br />How are you, sir?
2354148 2358192 This is Lt. Harris, Lt. Thaddeus Harris<br />out at the Police Academy.
2358193 2361237 I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir...
2361238 2365366 but your friend Cadet Mahoney<br />would like to speak with you.
2365367 2368452 Just one moment, please. Mahoney.
2368453 2371332 - Mahoney!<br />- Oh, yeah.
2372040 2374708 Hi, Captain Reed? Can I get out of here?
2374709 2376585 No? Okay.
2376586 2378381 I tried.
2380132 2383718 Captain Reed, urn, thank you so much.
2383719 2385470 Yes. Goodbye. Yes.
2388057 2390350 I don't know<br />what you're trying to do.
2390351 2392518 I don't know why you're here.
2392519 2395479 But you'll never be a cop<br />as long as I live.
2395480 2397440 - Don't want to be.<br />- Get your butt off my desk.
2397441 2399360 And get out of here!
2401278 2402905 Mahoney!
2403947 2405948 I've already told you once.
2405949 2408785 Nobody screws with me.
2409412 2412414 Well, maybe you'll meet the right girl<br />and all that'll change.
2412415 2414875 Get out of here now!
2418545 2421298 Come on, Mahoney.<br />Harris said you had to do a hundred.
2425428 2426886 Hey, Mahoney.
2426887 2430098 Here's a pair of my old sweat socks.<br />I wore them all day.
2430099 2432268 That should help you to get up.
2441277 2442945 You did it.
2443987 2446198 You son of a bitch.
2467219 2470055 This is a hell of a way<br />to spend my evenings.
2472849 2474768 I can't feel my arms anymore.
2479189 2481191 Hey, Barbara, come here.

2902446 2906073 I said two lines, dummy!<br />Now step it up, step it up, let's go.
2906074 2907326 Hey.
2908410 2910746 Why didn't you call me this weekend?
2913415 2916626 Well, uh, nothing really happened, sir.
2916627 2919296 There was a party, wasn't there?
2920339 2921841 Yes, sir.
2922424 2923968 Well, what went on?
2926261 2928096 Dancing, sir.
2928555 2929723 Mostly dancing.
2935938 2937189 Dancing?
2941861 2944780 Hightower, you're first. Let's go.
2955081 2956750 Come with me.
2980482 2981984 Uh...
2983485 2985320 Ready now, sir.

3001127 3003505 Tackleberry. You're next.
3018520 3020022 Come with me.
3026737 3029782 - Hey!<br />- Tackleberry!
3061855 3063523 Holy shit.
3066276 3068403 Get back here.
3075410 3077621 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
3080415 3083584 - Don't worry, I can explain everything.<br />- Shut up.
3083585 3087254 - Yes, sir.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
3087255 3088757 Yes, ma'am.
3089299 3093177 You've been sneaking in here<br />every night for weeks.
3093178 3095220 What? No.
3095221 3099308 What do you think<br />I ought to do about this?
3099309 3101979 Well, let's see. Uh...
3107442 3109069 My God.
3112156 3113949 Sir.
3115200 3116951 Ma'am.
3127546 3131966 A police officer must generate<br />respect and confidence.
3131967 3134969 His or her voice, Hooks...
3134970 3138848 has a great deal to do with that.<br />Hooks, get up. Stand right over here.
3138849 3140935 Today, Hooks.
3142103 3146272 Now, here is the house.
3146273 3148566 Here is the window.
3148567 3151486 And I am a burglar.
3152113 3155156 I am coming out of the window...
3155157 3158659 with a stolen stereo in my hand.
3158660 3162163 I'm coming out of the window,<br />over the hedge...
3162164 3164582 and you are the arresting officer.
3164583 3166251 What do you say, Hooks?
3166835 3170047 Don't move! This is a stickup.
3171840 3173340 Stickup?
3173341 3176804 I mean, police... Police officer. Stop.
3177596 3180224 Sit down, Hooks.
3180682 3181892 Sit, sit, sit.
3184394 3187564 Tackleberry, you try it. Same situation.
3187940 3191400 All right. Here is the house.<br />Here is the window.
3191401 3195696 I'm the burglar. I'm coming out<br />of the house, over the hedge...
3195697 3198074 I've got the stolen stereo in my hands.
3198075 3202246 Drop that stereo before I blow<br />your goddamn nuts off, asshole!
3206374 3210295 Tackleberry, we really need to talk.
3211213 3213923 Mahoney, let me ask you a question.
3213924 3215299 Hmm?
3215300 3218094 Have you ever had a woman just...
3218095 3221806 throw you down<br />and screw your goddamn brains out?
3221807 3223307 Uh, no.
3223308 3225893 It happened to me last night.
3225894 3229023 Really? How was it?
3229397 3231859 I think, uh...
3233443 3235403 I'm in love.
3236238 3237446 Wow.
3238657 3240741 - How many girls were there?<br />- Just one.
3240742 3242286 Just one?
3243411 3246289 You made love to just one girl?
3246290 3247957 That's disgusting.
3247958 3249834 Yeah, I know.
3251086 3254882 - Hey, George, can I ask you something?<br />- Sure.
3256383 3259052 Every now and then, uh...
3259053 3261762 you seem to lose your Spanish accent.
3261763 3263848 What's up?
3263849 3266768 Yeah. Every now and then.
3268729 3270563 Can you keep a secret?
3270564 3272106 Oh, yeah.
3272107 3274984 I'm not really George Martin.
3274985 3279781 I'm just plain old George Martin,<br />fourth-generation American. Ha, ha.
3280157 3282867 - Really?<br />- I just use the accent to get the girls.
3284619 3287206 - Does it work?<br />- Eh.
3291668 3294962 - Barbara!<br />- Uh, he's in the gym.
3294963 3297506 You're gonna pay for sending us<br />to the wrong party.
3297507 3300467 - I'll tell him.<br />- Not just pushups, either, Leslie.
3300468 3304305 We're gonna get your fat ass<br />thrown out of here. That's a promise!
3304306 3306015 - How?<br />- How?
3306016 3307308 You'll find out.
3307309 3310061 Mahoney isn't the only one here<br />who can play tricks.
3310062 3312438 Hey, hey. Take it easy.<br />These ain't track shoes.
3312439 3313898 Yeah, I know. Just hurry up.
3313899 3317735 I'm as anxious as you.<br />I'm not comfortable in these surroundings.
3317736 3319862 - Yeah, well, come on up.<br />- Up here?
3319863 3322698 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- Hey, listen, when do I get my money?
3322699 3324659 When the job's over,<br />for crying out loud.
3334044 3338048 That's good, Hightower.<br />Why don't you just sit down over there?
3341551 3345179 All right, you scumballs,<br />30 minutes to room inspection.
3345180 3348016 Move it. Move it. Move it.
3349184 3353147 - Hi, honey.<br />- Hi. Uh...
3357318 3360694 - Got a light?<br />- Uh...
3360695 3365367 I don't smoke. Ha, ha. I have a<br />friend who smokes. I'll go get him.
3368370 3370497 Mahoney, major problem.
3375419 3378714 Well, my goodness.
3383969 3388307 Would you please just calm down<br />and take it easy?
3390434 3394520 I just like to do it in strange places,<br />that's all. Okay?
3394521 3395981 Why the hell didn't you say so?
3397233 3401194 You'll find this academy one of the most<br />comprehensive in the country.
3401195 3405741 I could point out many,<br />many, many features to you. Um...
3407243 3409535 - Squeeze in here. Yeah.<br />- In here?
3409536 3411746 - You want to do it in a podium?<br />- All my life.
3411747 3413789 - Right. Where you going?<br /><i>- I'll</i> be back.
3413790 3417877 I'm not the customer. The real customer<br />will be here any second now, okay?
3417878 3419879 Oh, okay.
3419880 3422215 Gentlemen, please follow me.
3422216 3424926 We have a very, very fine...
3424927 3427263 slide presentation for you.
3428431 3430433 Please take your seats.
3430766 3433852 I think you'll find<br />there's plenty of room for everybody.
3434853 3436272 Thank you.
3440943 3443736 First of all, I'd like to say<br />how sorry I am...
3443737 3446155 that everybody could not make it today.
3446156 3450785 For those here, I think you'll find<br />the presentation interesting...
3450786 3453621 as well as very, very stimulating.
3462631 3465301 Could we have the lights turned down?
3466593 3469305 Now, this first slide...
3469930 3472057 shows a very...
3472682 3474393 very interesting thing:
3475311 3477271 Our main building.
3478814 3481984 In slide two...
3484487 3486280 we see...
3487323 3489157 another view...
3489158 3491535 of it.
3492369 3495498 Oh, my God. You wouldn't believe it.
3503588 3508050 Let us look at this slide for a moment,<br />without comment.
3508051 3510304 I think it speaks for itself.
3525444 3527112 Could we have the lights, please?
3531367 3532784 Well.
3533327 3537706 I hope this was as much fun for you<br />as it was for me.
3539875 3542211 Let's have lunch, shall we?
3542878 3546798 And maybe, smoke a cigarette.
3569405 3571156 Good speech.
3601604 3603854 What do you intend to do<br />about Mahoney?
3603855 3605940 - What's he done?<br />- What's he done?
3605941 3610070 I'll tell you what he's done. He...
3613740 3615241 Yes, sir?
3615242 3617453 He did a very, very bad thing.
3618579 3620413 To whom, sir?
3620414 3622332 To whom?
3626295 3627796 Yes, sir.
3628880 3631592 Well, I don't know.
3632717 3634511 Are you all right, sir?
3634512 3637556 No, not really. May I go?
3638516 3641184 - Of course, sir.<br />- Thank you.
3641185 3642936 You're welcome.
3647024 3650319 Left, right, left. Left. Left.
3659620 3662039 Left, right, left. Left.
3675886 3681558 Left, right, left.<br />Left. Left. Left, right, left.
3681559 3686312 From now on, part of your training<br />will be to ride, from time to time...
3686313 3689899 in actual squad cars<br />with actual police officers...
3689900 3691859 in actual situations.
3691860 3694904 And you'd better actually<br />keep your mouths shut.
3694905 3697532 And your eyes and your ears open.
3697533 3701203 Say, Mahoney,<br />why don't you ride with me?
3703622 3708459 Well, move it, cretins!<br />Move it, move it, move it!
3708460 3712547 Lieutenant Harris, I've changed<br />my mind. I want to be a cop.
3712548 3715675 - Never, punk.<br />- Why not? All I have to do is behave...
3715676 3717885 Get out of this car, Mahoney.<br />You hear me?
3717886 3722515 You get. Get, Mahoney.<br />You get out there and you follow me.
3722516 3725060 You stay right behind me, punk.
3731734 3734318 Oh, how I love a ride in the country.
3743995 3745871 Officer. Officer.
3745872 3748709 Can you get my kitty-cat out of the tree?
3750168 3752670 No problem, ma'am.
3752671 3754756 Oh, no. No, wait.
3762264 3764349 What the hell is this?
3771356 3774610 I'll be right back. I'm sorry.
3783619 3785954 What the hell is going on down there?
3786455 3788373 Move it!
3790584 3792461 Assholes.
3792919 3795254 Hey! Hey, you, give me that bike.
3795255 3799717 Come on, move it. This is official<br />police business. Move it out. Let's go.
3799718 3802137 - It's new.<br />- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.
3805390 3806767 Whoa!
3820781 3822658 My God.
3823450 3825160 Someone call a veterinarian.
3831166 3833335 Your new hat, sir.
3847307 3849517 You told no one?
3849518 3851436 Not a soul.
3913707 3917376 Hightower? Hightower?
3917377 3918795 I need to talk.
3918796 3920840 That's terrific, Hightower, but it's, uh...
3921298 3924676 It's 2:30 in the morning.
3924677 3927929 - The driving course is tomorrow.<br />- So?
3927930 3929889 I haven't driven a car since I was 12.
3929890 3931683 Really? You're kidding.
3931684 3936438 If I don't pass this driving course,<br />they're gonna kick me out. Harris said so.
3939399 3941735 All right. Let's go.
3943153 3945322 Sleeping is for fags.
3945614 3949618 First thing we gotta do is steal a car.<br />Copeland's should do.
3953956 3956040 Okay, your turn.
3956041 3958751 Now, you've got to remember<br />to drive defensively...
3958752 3963298 or offensively, depending<br />on your needs. Let's go.
3971431 3973099 Comfy?
3973642 3975142 - No.<br />- All right.
3975143 3977645 Let's just move the seat back a little.
3977646 3981149 On second thought, let's rip<br />the front seats out and sit in the back.
3996623 3999625 I was kidding about the front seat.<br />But this is good.
3999626 4001962 It's different. Comfort's important.
4005674 4010429 Put it into first. Right. Little more.<br />Okay, you can go a little faster now.
4011513 4017018 Yeah. Yeah, you're doing beautifully.<br />You feel it? You feel what's going on?
4017019 4019646 You can even<br />turn off the windshield wipers.
4020564 4022524 Yeah, that's it.
4023525 4026070 Okay, now there's another car.
4028781 4029949 Hightower?
4031324 4034994 Hightow...? What...?<br />You didn't hit the brakes.
4034995 4037288 You didn't tell me to.
4037289 4039040 You idiot!
4039041 4042168 You bastard! You dumb shit!
4053597 4056641 - Pull over and let me drive for a while.<br />- No, not now.
4056642 4058434 This is fun.
4061105 4063816 - Pull over.<br />- No, I'm getting out of here.
4092177 4093595 Holy shit!
4117744 4119079 Attaboy, Hightower.
4133010 4134469 Taught him everything he knows.
4145439 4149026 Not bad.
4149443 4152319 Miss Hooks, you're next.
4152320 4153654 Hurry UP!
4153655 4156323 Thanks, Mahoney. You saved my life.
4156324 4159077 - Maybe someday you'll save mine.<br />- Any time.
4159078 4161246 You're next. Yellow line. Yellow line.
4161789 4164331 <i>You better not cry</i>
4164332 4168837 <i>You better not pout<br />I'm telling you why</i>
4188398 4190191 Wee!
4190192 4191526 Oh, this is fun.
4195447 4198324 Ow! Ow! Ow!
4198325 4200367 What is it? What is it?
4200368 4202495 She ran over my feet.
4202496 4205039 I'm sorry. I really am.
4205040 4208961 Sorry? You dumb, fat jigaboo!
4212297 4214175 Oh, shit.
4218804 4221055 Oh, shit.
4221056 4223557 - At ease, Hightower. At ease.<br />- It's okay, Hightower.
4223558 4227103 - He didn't mean it. He was joking.<br />- Take it easy, now. Hightower!
4227104 4228771 Hightower, don't do that.
4228772 4233902 If you don't stop, you are out of here.<br />I am warning you, Hightower!
4244079 4247081 You messed up big, mister.
4247082 4251419 Now you get your stuff<br />and get out of here, right now.
4252420 4253714 Get!
4257092 4259802 <i>Attention,<br />applications for motorcycle service...</i>
4259803 4263306 <i>should be turned in<br />at the Administration building by Friday.</i>
4263307 4266184 <i>Applications for motorcycle service<br />should be turned in...</i>
4266185 4269188 One down, several to go.
4276570 4279031 Copeland, get out of that car.
4288207 4289957 Mahoney.
4292253 4294088 It's got to be Mahoney.
4295964 4299718 I know, I know. Come on.
4303889 4307434 Out of all the people I thought would<br />make it, Hightower was the one.
4307935 4311313 I mean, if all the cops looked like him,<br />there'd be no crime at all.
4312439 4314315 I'm getting sick of this place.
4314316 4317152 How're you doing, "Ma-homo"?
4317569 4319486 Don't fool with me.<br />Not in the mood.
4319487 4321155 You wrecked my car.
4321156 4324992 No, Hightower did. Why don't you<br />go see him? That'd be a matchup.
4324993 4327121 Because we want you.
4327746 4331332 Okay, how about, uh, 12:00 midnight?<br />Nine o'clock on the coast.
4331333 4335712 No, no. I'm talking right now, Mahoney.<br />Let's go. You throw the first punch.
4336088 4337588 Cadet could get thrown out...
4337589 4340092 - for hitting another cadet.<br />- Oh, really?
4340634 4343469 I thought you wanted to get thrown out.
4343470 4345347 Here's your chance.
4347599 4349059 No.
4350477 4354855 Now, Mahoney, I'm going to rub this<br />right in your face.
4354856 4356607 On your mark...
4356608 4358485 get set...
4370705 4373457 - Wait, you guys! Wait!<br />- What the hell...?
4373458 4376419 Who threw the first punch?
4376420 4379005 - That's all I want to know.<br />- Barbara did.
4379006 4381675 - Barbara?<br />- That's right, sir.
4382718 4385928 Then he's out of here.<br />Him and his queer dog.
4385929 4389391 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />Barbara didn't throw the first punch.
4389392 4391059 - He did so.<br />- I threw the punch.
4391060 4393436 Mahoney, you're out<br />of your mind. Lieutenant...
4393437 4397524 - Blankes, who'd you rather have out?<br />- ls that true, Blankes?
4399235 4401611 Did Mahoney start it?
4404323 4407076 Yes, sir. Mahoney started it.
4408202 4412122 Then, Mahoney, my little piss-ant...
4413040 4415959 you are out of the Academy...
4416460 4418087 forever.
4419963 4421798 Get your stuff.
4423008 4424508 And get out.
4424509 4427096 Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.
4441777 4443946 Does the radio bother you?
4447116 4449159 I could turn it down.
4456459 4458543 Here, I brought you an apple.
4460212 4461505 Thanks.
4467303 4468929 Hey, man, what...?
4471056 4472433 Whoa!
4489783 4492660 My God. Here, take this.
4492661 4495413 Hey, free TV's.
4500461 4503464 Hey, everybody! There's a riot going on.
4509052 4512096 My livelihood! You're ruining me!
4512097 4515183 What do you got there?<br />What are you doing with that TV?
4522024 4524817 - Hi. Want a ride?<br />- No, thanks.
4539375 4541083 Hey, did you two hear the news...
4541084 4542751 - on the radio?<br />- No.
4542752 4545880 - A riot's broken out downtown.<br />- How come?
4545881 4547840 Who knows how these things<br />get started?
4547841 4550259 <i>Attention! All cadets report immediately...</i>
4550260 4552053 <i>to the parking lot in full riot gear.</i>
4552054 4556224 <i>Repeat, all cadets report immediately<br />to the parking lot in full riot gear.</i>
4556225 4557559 <i>This is not a drill.</i>
4557560 4560396 - Jones! Was that you?<br />- No, man.
4561146 4564315 Let's go, let's go, let's go!
4564316 4569029 Get out there fast!<br />Move it, move it, move it!
4569738 4571364 Let's go, let's go.
4584836 4588632 This is it. This is the big one.
4589383 4591300 It's time this cop...
4591301 4593470 met the public.
4599268 4603104 All right, listen up.<br />Here's the situation. There is a state...
4603105 4606482 of general disorder<br />in the Oakfield section of town.
4606483 4608776 Real police are handling the problem.
4608777 4612113 We are being sent<br />to a peripheral safe area.
4612114 4616117 Our job will be merely to divert traffic<br />away from the trouble zone...
4616118 4618578 and to protect public property.
4618579 4620371 You will have live ammunition...
4620372 4622457 but there will be no call to use it.
4622458 4626461 Tackleberry, do you understand,<br />numb nuts?
4626462 4628005 Yes, sir.
4635846 4637640 Come on!
4642311 4644938 We are now entering<br />the expressway at Belmont.
4645523 4648650 Very good. Your bus is to deploy<br />on Sixteenth Street...
4648651 4650776 <i>between 4th and 8th Avenues.</i>
4650777 4653279 Sixteenth Street? Are you sure, sir?
4653280 4655740 Of course I'm sure.<br />I never forget a number.
4657075 4658535 Yes, sir.
4658536 4660454 There's nobody around.
4661413 4663999 I guess they're hiding.
4676303 4679639 All right, let's go, dirtbags, unload it.<br />Let's move it.
4679640 4682559 I want two lines right here.<br />Come on, dummies.
4682560 4685937 Let's go, let's go.
4689608 4692026 You, one block over, one block up.
4692027 4694238 You, one block down.
4695489 4698908 You, one block up. You, one block over.
4698909 4703371 You, one block over. Let's go. Let's go.
4703372 4705749 If you have to make an arrest...
4705750 4708543 do it as quietly as possible.
4710921 4713382 Boy, it sure is quiet around here, huh?
4729064 4731566 Hey, Fackler. How's it going?
4731567 4733444 Oh, just fine, thanks.
4736238 4739574 - What the hell are you doing here?<br />- We're from the Academy.
4739575 4743661 You're supposed to be blocks away.<br />The damn riot's right down this street.
4743662 4745539 We're pulling out.
4747792 4752002 I love sushi. I'm into back-rubs,<br />all kinds of Japanese stuff.
4752003 4754422 My car stereo, it's a Sony.
4754423 4757841 I got a good friend, his father was killed<br />at Pearl Harbor.
4757842 4761763 Hey, maybe your family had<br />something to do with it?
4761764 4763765 You know sake? The wine?
4763766 4767645 I know a place where they heat it up<br />before they serve it.
4768562 4770354 Holy shit.
4770355 4772608 I got to go now.
4781158 4782909 Run!
4811605 4815442 Hello, men. I thought I'd come by<br />for a personal inspection.
4816485 4818736 - Okay if we get in, sir?<br />- I guess so.
4818737 4821989 Sure, why not?<br />Well, men, how's it going?
4821990 4825075 I want you to give me a fix<br />on the entire situation.
4825076 4826704 Not that good, sir.
4827162 4830749 Oh, so this is very, very, very bad.
4831876 4834002 The main thing is not to panic.
4839675 4842218 Attention! Attention, everybody.
4842219 4847515 Attention. This is Commandant<br />Eric Lassard of the Police Academy.
4847516 4850894 If you do not disperse immediately,<br />my men will have to arrest you.
4850895 4856859 You have five seconds to move away.<br />Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
4860070 4861529 Give me the thing.
4897399 4899693 You should park cars for a living, sir.
4906992 4908660 Anybody want any of this?
4908661 4910495 You want this? You'd die for this.
4910496 4912664 - You're not so tough now.<br />- Come and take it.
4912665 4915166 - How about you? You want this?<br />- What's the matter?
4915167 4919379 - I'm talking to you, twerp.<br />- Just too dumb to talk, huh?
4947282 4950076 Damn it. Look, in here.
4952579 4954164 Try this one.
4961463 4966175 Help. Help.<br />This is Cadet Leslie Barbara. Help.
4966176 4969387 Barbara, this is Lt. Harris.
4969388 4970639 Just calm down.
4971640 4974018 I'm being chased by 30 rioters.
4975602 4977812 Barbara, just tell me where you are.
4977813 4979940 I'm passing you now, sir.
4984611 4986739 Holy shit.
4992995 4994162 Hi.
4998918 5001127 Get the cops!
5018604 5019646 Uh...
5022691 5025610 Okay. Hold it right there, guys.
5025611 5027695 Why, if it isn't Leslie Barbara...
5027696 5030198 - the police officer.<br />- Yeah.
5030991 5033409 Come on, Les,<br />you're not going to shoot us.
5033410 5036496 You wouldn't shoot old friends,<br />would you?
5042044 5043629 No.
5044546 5046048 Les.
5047049 5049301 Get lost. We're busy.
5066902 5071698 Now, get the furniture back up there<br />and get out of the area.
5072240 5074451 But it's our furniture.
5075786 5077245 Oh.
5078330 5079623 Sorry.
5091760 5094720 Callahan calling Harris. Come in, please.
5094721 5096306 Harris, come in.
5099309 5100852 Where the hell is Harris'?
5100853 5103104 - I don't know.<br />- What?
5103105 5105190 - She doesn't know.<br />- I heard her.
5108276 5109820 Run!
5119621 5121165 Why don't you shoot back?
5125961 5128047 - Are those gunshots?<br />- Fucking A.
5130257 5132843 Shoot back. Come on.
5134762 5137597 Look up there. See? See?
5137598 5140100 That looks like Harris up there.
5140101 5141936 Should we shoot back?
5143228 5145147 Hmm.
5146356 5147983 Hmm.
5148817 5150527 I don't think so.
5154322 5155866 Come on!
5158619 5159954 Stay there.
5161163 5162623 Mahoney!
5163165 5165542 Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
5167044 5170046 I'll bet there's a back door to this place.
5170047 5173424 Hooks. Hooks!<br />Hooks, get the hell back here.
5173425 5175302 That's an order.
5229106 5230565 Freeze!
5231942 5233902 Oh, shit.
5260929 5262763 Don't move, you bastard.
5262764 5265893 Run, Thompson! Run!
5267978 5269187 Put the gun down.
5270438 5272524 Let's say you put your gun down.
5275944 5279865 Lieutenant Harris, any last-minute<br />tips or suggestions?
5282243 5283994 Nothing really comes to mind.
5286580 5288165 What's it gonna be?
5292253 5294296 Throw your gun over the ledge.
5296631 5298383 I got two piglet-wigglets.
5300761 5302470 Hey!
5302971 5304306 What do you want?
5305266 5307559 I want to watch you off these pigs.
5313732 5316318 Sure. Ha, ha. Sure.
5323951 5325911 - Which one do we do first?<br />- Hmm.
5334544 5336545 I believe I'd shoot this one.
5336546 5337798 Yeah, the old one.
5347015 5351645 - Looks like cadet revolvers to me.<br />- I know those guys.
5355690 5358735 Don't move, dirtbag!
5387431 5389682 - Hey, hey, hey.<br />- What's wrong with this man?
5389683 5392353 There was gunplay, sir, and he missed it.
5403530 5407283 - Lieutenant Harris? Captain Reed.<br />- Nice to meet you, sir.
5407284 5410578 Thank you. I also want to thank you<br />for looking out for Mahoney.
5410579 5413164 It was an honor and a pleasure, sir.
5413165 5415209 Thank you, sir. Ha, ha.
5422049 5424259 - Could you just...?<br />- This woman bothering you?
5424260 5427304 What? Uh, no. This is my mother.
5428555 5431057 Ten-four. Carry on.
5431058 5432851 - Oh, my precious...<br />- Mom, would...?
5433227 5435561 - Then at 8:00 you'll meet my mother.<br />- Right.
5435562 5438107 - You'd better have some flowers.<br />- Flowers, check.
5442069 5443528 You men, stop that.
5447866 5449992 Oh, well, ha, ha.
5449993 5451661 That's more like it, Mahoney.
5452455 5454831 Good man. Keep up the good work.
5455499 5457125 Thank you, sir.

5471681 5473557 and to me, also.
5473558 5477186 I could tell you many, many stories,<br />but instead...
5477187 5479563 I have a presentation to make.
5479564 5483276 No Academy cadet has ever received<br />the highest award...
5483277 5485237 this police department has to make.

5494413 5496665 Gentlemen, please step forward.
5532242 5534661 You are both expected<br />to make a few short remarks.
5537873 5540376 Officer Hightower.
5546048 5547550 Thanks.
5550010 5552888 That was very, very, very good.
