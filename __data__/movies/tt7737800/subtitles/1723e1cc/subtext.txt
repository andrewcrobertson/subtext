23125 25375 [birds chirping]
76875 78309 - [Sarah] Right here?<br />- [Rodney] Yep.
78333 79333 [Sarah] Okay.
84541 87458 [Sarah chuckles] I've never<br />done this before. What do I do?
87541 91166 [Rodney chuckling]<br />Just be yourself.
91250 93375 Try and forget that<br />there's a camera here.
93958 94958 [Sarah] Okay.
95041 97833 [Rodney] Tell me about<br />yourself. Where are you from?
99250 101916 - Texas.<br />- Texas? Really?
102000 103916 What brings you to Wyoming?
104000 106958 [Sarah] My boyfriend<br />and I wanted to, uh…
107041 109833 Well, ex-boyfriend.
109916 112916 We wanted to see<br />all 50 states, like,
113000 116166 to say that we had seen all<br />of the states before, um…
118708 120000 [exhales] Um…
125250 126250 Shit.
130750 131750 I'm so sorry.
133083 134083 [Rodney] Hey.
136708 138208 You don't need to apologize.
138750 139833 It's so embarrassing.
139916 141458 - No, it's not.<br />- [sniffles]
142000 143000 Hey, look at me.
145291 146416 [sniffles]
148541 150666 You're beautiful,<br />okay? It's fine.
151875 154458 Just keep talking. Okay?
161958 163041 So, yeah, we…
164125 166500 We wanted to have<br />this big adventure…
168208 169458 before the baby came.
171500 176000 So… that was the plan.<br />[chuckles and sniffles]
177916 178916 Then…
179708 180833 And then he just left.
182041 183916 - And I… I…<br />- [camera shutter clicking]
184625 188291 And I don't know if it<br />was me or if he just…
189583 191791 he just didn't want to be a dad.
195583 197000 Have you told your family?
200125 201125 No.
202833 205791 No, my mom, she never<br />liked him, and I…
207666 210083 I don't want to hear<br />"I told you so."
213250 214250 [sighs]
215875 218291 Uh, I'm… I'm terrified.
219083 221958 Like, I knew he was risky,
222500 225208 but, like… fuck it.
226208 227375 Everyone's risky.
229916 230916 I don't know.
233625 234791 I'm so sorry.
235916 237625 I'm just blah, you know? I just…
237708 241208 I haven't really had a chance to talk<br />to anyone about it yet and I, um…
241916 244041 I really needed that. Thank you.
256041 257458 [chuckles nervously]
259583 260791 What the fuck?
279333 281000 [breathes deeply]
294125 296416 - [Rodney grunting]<br />- [Sarah yelling]

364750 365875 [screaming]
368000 370375 [man 1] It's just<br />not quite right.
370458 372291 [man 2] Yeah, I don't<br />feel sorry for her.
372375 374916 - She's not sympathetic.<br />- [man 1] Because she seems angry.
375000 377041 - That's it. She seems angry.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
377125 378166 What about her look?
378250 379416 Eh, it's okay.
379500 381666 She kinda looks like that<br />one girl in that thing.
381750 382666 From the, uh…
382750 384666 The movie about the<br />junkies in Central Park.
384750 386958 Yes. I hated it.<br />Did you like it?
389875 392291 - [softly] No.<br />- Bad. It was bad.
392375 393458 It was horrible.
395500 396750 [sighs]
399500 401750 Did you want me to<br />try it again or…
403958 405750 No, that was great.
407083 409708 It says here that you did your<br />BFA in acting at Columbia.
409791 410791 Yeah.
410875 412791 I have a friend who went<br />through that program.
412875 414541 It's a great program. Yeah.
414625 416416 What year did you graduate?
417916 418833 Hmm?
418916 420250 You might know each other.
421208 423083 I might. What's his name?
423166 424208 Hmm.
424875 426041 Kevin Wetmore.
426125 428666 Mmm. He might have<br />been before me.
429375 431625 Mmm-hmm. How do you know<br />he wasn't after you?
431708 432708 Hmm.
434166 436000 [all chuckle]
436083 438916 And you're okay<br />with nudity, right?
439750 442166 Uh, no, um, it's<br />just not for me.
442250 445083 Oh, no, I'm… I'm<br />sure they're fine.
446833 447833 Mmm.
450000 454166 - All right. Well, we'll be in touch.<br />- Mmm-hmm. Mmm.
455291 457500 Okay. Um…
457583 459958 - Well, great. Thank you guys so much.<br />- Yes.
460041 460875 Thank you.
460958 462000 Um…
462708 465375 Have a great rest of your<br />day. Always nice to see you.
465458 466666 - Like as well.<br />- You too.
466750 467833 Thanks.
467916 469958 - Okay. Sheryl.<br />- Yeah?
470041 471125 - No.<br />- No.
471208 473583 Uh… Oh, Janet.
474208 475208 - Janet.<br />- Janet.
481083 484708 [Sheryl] And I really appreciate that<br />you keep inviting me to audition.
484791 486875 I would just love it so much
486958 490291 if you could look up from the<br />table when I'm reading the scene.
490833 494083 That would just… Just<br />really make my day.

501083 502250 [yells]
505083 506083 [music stops]
507125 508125 Okay.
510333 511541 [Terry] It's a big deal.
511625 513666 Network execs don't always<br />give actors direct notes,
513750 514875 but that's the best part.
514958 517166 This one pulls me over,<br />he says, "Your face."
517250 519333 "Something about your face<br />has a lot of character."
519416 521291 Which is great. Which<br />means if I test well,
521375 523083 they'll make me a<br />recurring cast member.
523166 525916 Not every single episode,<br />but, you know, it's…
526000 527458 Hey, how's it going?
527541 529750 - Hi.<br />- How'd it go?
529833 531875 Um… Yeah, not… I don't…
531958 533583 [chuckles] Not that great.
533666 535500 - What? You're kidding.<br />- Yeah.
535583 539291 I know. I know. I made you run all<br />those lines with me again for nothing.
539375 541500 - No, acting is never wasted time.<br />- [phone ringing]
541583 544000 I was acting, you were<br />acting. Actors act.
544083 546750 - Well, that's very sweet, Terry.<br />- No. I'm being real.
546833 549416 All right. I'm not being<br />sweet, I'm being sincere.
549500 551541 That choice you made when<br />you started whispering
551625 554000 when you were talking about<br />your mom? It gave me goosebumps.
554083 555916 It sounds like your<br />thing went well, huh?
556000 558833 I don't want to talk… Yes.<br />I mean, it went very well.
558916 560375 [Sheryl] I wanna<br />hear all about it.
560458 563750 You're just so good. I don't know<br />how you're not booking anything.
565375 567415 - Hello?<br />- [woman] Hi, Sheryl, I have Helen for you.
567458 568958 Terry. I just need one second.
569041 570750 Oh, yeah, no problem.
570833 572833 - [Helen] Hey, sorry I missed your call.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
572875 574708 - I had a client walk off set.<br />- Yeah.
574791 576916 The director fired a<br />gun. It's just chaos.
577000 578541 Oh, wow. That's, um…
579125 580791 No, that sounds crazy.
580875 583083 No, I just walked in the<br />door. Did they call already?
583166 584083 They loved you.
584166 586166 No, I really don't<br />think they did.
586250 588458 Well, they thought you weren't<br />quite right for this one.
589208 591875 - So good.<br />- They said you seemed a little too…
591958 594500 Yeah, I'm auditioning in<br />a couple weeks I think.
594583 597833 They just weren't sure that you<br />were passionate about the project.
597916 600875 I mean, I am trying,<br />but sure, yeah.
600958 603833 I feel like we've been getting<br />that feedback a lot lately.
603916 607750 Are you still working with that<br />acting coach? Can we find you a…
607833 610291 - Um… Look, Helen?<br />- Yeah? Yeah.
610375 611375 Um…
612375 616041 I think I can maybe just beat you<br />to the punch a little bit here.
616125 618291 - Yeah, I'm rambling. You go ahead.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
618375 621833 I'm working really hard and I'm<br />accomplishing very little, so…
624041 626625 I'm not really sure what<br />I'm doing in L.A. anymore.
627708 629625 Oh, lots of people<br />go through that.
629708 630750 Right.
631375 633250 Helen, I can barely<br />afford my rent.
634916 637541 Hold that thought.<br />Robin, hand me that.
638250 640416 - Thank you. Sheryl? Honey?<br />- Yeah?
640500 643833 Okay, sweetie, you know the ABC<br />Studios where they shoot all those…
643916 644833 Mmm-hmm.
644916 645791 You know the one.
645875 648166 - The stages in the Valley.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
648250 650583 Well, I booked you a<br />guest spot on a TV show.
651541 654916 - Wait, really?<br />- Yep. Yeah, you bet. Friday.
655750 657750 Right, but I didn't audition.
657833 658666 You didn't have to.
658750 661333 I sent them your resume,<br />they think you're perfect.
661416 664333 Um… What's the show?
665583 666666 Bachelor number three,
666750 668875 if I were an ice cream sundae,
668958 673541 what flavor would you want me<br />to be and how would you eat me?
673625 676250 If you were my ex-wife,<br />I'd have to say Rocky Road.
676333 678625 [audience laughing]
678708 680708 [audience applauding]
682666 684750 Um… I need a drink.
684833 686433 - [man] I'm a vanilla man myself.<br />- Yeah.
686500 689416 I didn't think I'd come out<br />here and be famous. I just…
689500 691958 I thought if I was<br />disciplined, and I have been…
692041 695375 Yeah, you're locked in your<br />apartment running lines.
695458 697416 I can hear you most of the time.
697500 698416 I have notes.
698500 700375 - [both chuckle]<br />- I have a few notes.
700458 702583 I haven't even been<br />on a date in two years
702666 704750 'cause I didn't want<br />the distraction.
704833 706083 And now the…
707916 709125 I don't know. Helen…
710208 712750 Helen says it's good<br />because it'll get me seen,
712833 717166 and Sally Field was on the show,<br />so she's not totally wrong.
718291 720833 But still, it just feels…
721458 722458 Beneath you?
723416 724500 You think I'm being a brat.
724583 727458 No, it's beneath you, but I<br />still think it's a good thing.
728416 729500 The show?
730125 731375 - No shit.<br />- Why?
731458 734333 Because you're gonna<br />meet some cheese ball guy
734416 737458 who you'll spend all of two<br />minutes with and you'll hate,
737541 739625 and then you'll be back here.
739708 742083 Right here at the bar<br />laughing about it with me.
742166 743166 Why will I hate him?
743708 746791 - 'Cause he's gonna be a dork.<br />- [laughs]
746875 749625 And you'd rather be<br />hanging out with me.
749708 751583 - Yes, obviously.<br />- Obviously.
751666 754083 I mean, you're basically<br />my only friend out here.
754166 755166 Well…
756875 758250 And that's good.
762791 764875 All right, shall we? Another?
764958 767166 Uh, no, I probably<br />shouldn't. I, you know…
768083 770041 got my big break coming up, so…
771333 773583 I don't want to look<br />like garbage for that.
773666 775875 You could never<br />look like garbage.
775958 778416 You always look beautiful.
779333 780708 That's sweet. [chuckles]
783250 786208 Oh, my God. Sorry. [laughs]
786291 788833 That just took me<br />by surprise. Um…
789916 792375 No, that just tickled for, um…
793208 794750 That just took me by surprise.
796208 798000 Sorry, I'm… I…
798666 802583 I think I'm a little jumpy. I<br />had a weird… Pretty weird day.
802666 803916 [chuckles awkwardly]
805083 806166 Yeah, no, I…
807333 808500 I get it.
817916 819041 Okay, great.
824166 825833 Do you want to leave?
828833 830083 No. Um…
831583 833208 No, we should have another one.
844875 845875 [Sheryl sighs]
853333 854333 [officer] Wake up.
858666 859833 Can't stay here.
861166 862500 - Pack it up.<br />- Yeah, okay.

1168791 1171583 Um, good. Yeah, I<br />think it'll be fun.
1171666 1175458 It'll be so fun. I promise. We'll<br />get you through hair and makeup.
1175541 1178333 I saw your bachelors backstage.<br />You got a good batch.
1178416 1180250 Oh, really? What are they like?
1180333 1184208 - [Marilyn] They're idiots, all of them.<br />- I don't know where they get 'em from.
1184291 1185541 - From under a rock.<br />- Right?
1185625 1189416 Do you remember that one guy that<br />we had on the show? Um, filmmaker.
1189500 1192083 - [woman] Oh, Jesus Christ.<br />- Oh, my God.
1192166 1193500 He was beautiful,
1193583 1195875 but I'm telling you,<br />the IQ of a lug nut.
1195958 1197583 Oh, it was really too bad.
1197666 1199625 - You want some?<br />- No. I'm…
1199708 1202166 So he shows up with his<br />identical twin brother
1202250 1204250 and he says, "Oh,<br />I'm making a movie."
1204333 1205666 "We're both acting in it."
1205750 1208333 "I'm the star, but he's<br />playing my best friend."
1208416 1209875 - [soft music playing]<br />- [laughs]
1209958 1212750 His identical twin brother<br />is playing his best friend.
1212833 1214541 - What the hell is that?<br />- Brilliant.
1214625 1215833 - I love it.<br />- Oh, God.
1215916 1219041 Is it possible to get a guy in<br />this town that isn't a maniac?
1219125 1220250 [woman] Or a total moron.
1220333 1222041 Hello. Hey, how's<br />everybody doing?
1222125 1223708 Whoa, a room full<br />of beautiful women.
1223791 1226291 Put that skunk weed away. You're<br />going to get me in trouble.
1226375 1228916 What's up, Marilyn?<br />So this is Sheryl.
1229000 1231958 - Yeah, hi.<br />- They told me that you went to Juilliard.
1232041 1233916 - No.<br />- Well, that's fantastic.
1234000 1237083 So I guess you're a real music<br />freak? Do you like the sound of this?
1237166 1238333 Yeah, it's cool.
1238416 1239583 There you go. See?
1240208 1242250 Women love that Black sound.
1242833 1245833 Come on, whatever<br />happened to Tony Bennett?
1245916 1247958 Whatever happened<br />to Bing Crosby?
1248041 1251041 I mean, if you want soul, listen<br />to Perry Como singing "Moonglow."
1251666 1253666 - Hey, can you do me a favor?<br />- Yeah.
1253750 1256958 Okay. You're an intelligent<br />girl, anyone can see that.
1257041 1258708 But when you get on that stage,
1258791 1261208 I don't want you to play<br />so smart, all right?
1261291 1263083 The guys are<br />getting intimidated.
1263166 1264833 - You know boys, they're babies.<br />- Right.
1264916 1266291 You know? That's right.
1266375 1268583 I just need you to laugh and<br />smile just over and over.
1268666 1270166 - Can you do that for me?<br />- Sure.
1270250 1271517 - I'd appreciate it.<br />- Of course.
1271541 1273625 There you go. You have<br />a beautiful smile.
1273708 1275875 - Mr. Burke, your wife's on the phone.<br />- Yeah?
1275958 1278708 Okay, thanks. Is this… Is<br />this the dress you're wearing?
1278791 1279666 Yeah, yeah.
1279750 1283083 Hey, Bruce. Hey,<br />Bruce, can you hear me?
1283166 1284375 - [Bruce] Yes.<br />- Yeah,
1284458 1287208 can we get her in something<br />a little more flattering?
1287291 1289166 She's got the body,<br />so let's use it.
1289250 1290750 All right. Thank you so much.
1292083 1293708 [woman] Looks perfect.
1294333 1297416 [Lisa] The audience is filling<br />up. Everyone's getting excited.
1297500 1298791 Great.
1298875 1300708 [woman] Looks great.<br />Actually, know what?
1300791 1302375 Maybe we should try the updo.
1302458 1303666 Yeah, whatever you want.
1303750 1305101 - Yeah?<br />- [Marilyn] I like it down.
1305125 1307041 [woman] You like it down?<br />Okay, let's do down.
1307125 1307958 Great.
1308041 1310083 [woman] Nice and<br />flowing. Fabulous.
1311791 1313791 [indistinct chatter]
1320958 1323208 [woman] Careful. Smooth<br />it out. Watch the car.
1323291 1325291 [Ken] Relax, Mom, it's fine.
1326125 1327000 This is it?
1327083 1329208 It doesn't look like<br />a television studio.
1329291 1331208 Mom, how would you know?<br />You've never seen one.
1331291 1333208 Hey, don't talk<br />back to your mother.
1333291 1334791 Just looks so drab.
1334875 1337250 What you see on TV, all<br />these lights and stages.
1337333 1340208 - There's lights inside, I promise.<br />- Doesn't it look drab?
1340291 1342250 Should we grab the<br />umbrellas? It's gonna rain.
1342333 1344666 Gonna rain? Come on.<br />Let's hurry it up.
1346375 1347708 How are you holding up?
1347791 1349208 I don't know.
1349291 1351458 I'm feeling a little drab.
1352291 1354875 On TV, they have all those<br />big lights and stages.
1354958 1355958 Yeah, yeah.
1357541 1359458 So what do you think?
1359541 1361166 - It's great.<br />- Awesome.
1366583 1367875 We're ready for you.
1369875 1370958 Okay.
1371750 1373958 [man 1] All right,<br />everybody. Let's get started.
1374041 1375875 [man 2] Fine to start<br />without the live feed.
1378250 1380250 [audience cheering<br />and applauding]
1382958 1384208 [man 2] It's fine. Good to go.
1385625 1387083 [man 3] Ed's ready backstage.

1407666 1410833 And who knows? Will today<br />be the day that sparks fly?
1410916 1413416 All right, Ed's just<br />doing his intro now.
1413500 1416625 - As soon as he's done...<br />- Wait, he's on right now?
1416708 1419500 Mmm-hmm. Okay, oh, just<br />watch your step here.
1419583 1420583 - Be careful.<br />- Sorry.

1432333 1434083 - Up these steps.<br />- Okay. Great.

1438416 1439541 Great. Have fun.
1439625 1442000 [Ed] …show you how we play<br />the game. Come with me.
1442625 1444583 Before we meet our three<br />eligible bachelors,
1444666 1446833 I think we should meet<br />our lovely bachelorette.
1446916 1450708 I had the chance to meet her backstage<br />and she is ready for a connection.
1450791 1453291 [whispering] Sally Field.<br />Sally Field. Sally Field.
1453375 1456833 [Ed] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome<br />the woman of the hour, Sheryl!
1456916 1458125 Shit.
1458208 1461375 - [upbeat music playing]<br />- [audience applauding]
1463125 1465875 [breathing heavily]
1469083 1470791 [Charlie] I gotta<br />get out of here.
1471625 1473625 Somewhere I can see the sky.
1474666 1475708 [sighs]
1477750 1479208 Yeah, I can't wait.
1480583 1483166 No, the place is great.<br />It's coming together.
1484333 1486750 I'm still seeing you<br />this weekend, right?
1487416 1488416 [chuckles]
1488500 1492541 Yeah, well, you better, 'cause<br />you're in the doghouse now.
1493166 1494625 [chuckles]
1494708 1495750 Shit.
1501833 1503250 [humming]
1506375 1507750 [doorbell buzzes]
1510208 1512250 [door continues buzzing]
1513833 1515833 [Charlie singing indistinctly]
1519125 1521416 [vehicle doors closing]
1524875 1525875 Shit.
1526333 1528291 Sorry. Coming.
1530625 1531625 Coming.
1532708 1534250 Hey, hey.
1534916 1536875 - Hey, is this for 2-A?<br />- [man] It is.
1536958 1538791 'Kay, great. Here,<br />I'll let you in.
1538875 1540875 We've been ringing the<br />apartment for ten minutes.
1540958 1543208 Sorry, I was in the<br />shower. I didn't hear it.
1544708 1545833 Tommy, let's go.
1547833 1548833 What?
1549583 1551291 You're just gonna<br />leave it all out here?
1551375 1554125 [man] Wish we could help, but<br />we have a schedule to keep.
1554208 1555708 [engine starts]
1567000 1568500 Hey, Ansel Adams.
1570000 1572416 - It's, like, the last thing.<br />- Yeah. It better be.
1572500 1574000 [laughs] Yeah. I think it is.
1574083 1578250 Okay. Almost. Okay.
1579166 1580541 [sighs] You want a beer?
1580625 1582125 You've never heard<br />of Roman Polanski?
1582208 1585000 - He's the doorman at the Ice Palace?<br />- No, no, no. No.
1585083 1586333 Big guy with the tattoos?
1586416 1587708 No. He's the short guy
1587791 1590250 who directed Repulsion<br />and Rosemary's Baby.
1591291 1593500 - Are those movies or...<br />- You're killing me.
1593583 1595503 - I'm trying to name-drop here.<br />- Drop away, man.
1595583 1597958 No, because you don't<br />know who I'm talking about
1598041 1599625 so it's not as impressive.
1599708 1601250 [laughs]
1601833 1603125 You're fucking with me.
1603208 1606041 Have I seen Rosemary's<br />Baby? Come on.
1606125 1608416 What? I don't know. Maybe<br />you don't like scary movies.
1608500 1612041 I don't like scary movies, but<br />I've seen Rosemary's-fucking-Baby.
1612125 1615375 Okay, so I took a class<br />with him at NYU, all right?
1615458 1618833 With Roman Polanski,<br />I mean. And that's it.
1618916 1621541 - That's all I wanted to say.<br />- Very impressive.
1623375 1624583 Do you feel better now?
1626125 1628291 - [exhales]<br />- [laughs softly]
1630166 1631500 You still go there?
1631583 1633083 I just graduated.
1633166 1635583 Congratulations. That's amazing.
1635666 1637041 So what now?
1637125 1639250 I'm off to New<br />Hampshire, actually.
1639958 1642708 Yeah. I'm gonna be<br />teaching kids photography.
1642791 1643791 Very cool.
1643875 1645000 Yeah.
1645083 1646750 You know, it's crazy.
1647708 1649291 It's my last day here,
1650166 1652083 and I meet you. [chuckles]
1652166 1657333 Like, it's so hard to meet people, you<br />know, that you can connect with, so…
1658208 1662250 when I do I just… I like to<br />savor the moment, you know?
1664666 1665750 Yeah.
1666958 1669500 Yeah, no, I'm… I'm the same way.
1674708 1677916 Hey, so I should probably<br />get this shit together.
1678000 1681333 I mean, this place is a mess.<br />I have to get unpacking.
1681416 1684833 It's, like, such a disaster. I don't<br />know where anything is gonna go,
1684916 1687000 it's, ugh, a bit insane.
1687083 1689375 But thank you so<br />much for your help.
1689458 1692000 It was very, very,<br />very useful, so…
1694625 1696375 So, you said you<br />were a stewardess?
1697500 1698500 [Charlie] Uh, yeah.
1699833 1701375 Well, what's that like?
1701916 1704375 Well, I get to get groped<br />by sweaty businessman
1704458 1706416 while putting things<br />in the overhead,
1706500 1708041 so what's not to love?
1709000 1710625 But, no, it is great.
1710708 1714208 I mean, I get to see the<br />world and travel for free and…
1716208 1718500 I mean, I get to go<br />to Egypt next week.
1718583 1721458 I've always wanted to go to<br />Egypt, so I'm very excited.
1723000 1725416 I think at first I was afraid<br />that I was gonna get lonely
1725500 1728083 being away from home, but<br />my airline is amazing...
1728166 1729416 Can I take your picture?
1734541 1736541 [traffic bustling]
1741916 1744291 - [glass breaking]<br />- [Charlie grunting]
1748250 1750000 [Charlie screaming]
1754500 1756333 [Rodney grunting]
1758416 1761333 - [coughing]<br />- [panting]
1767875 1769458 [choking]
1780083 1781541 [camera shutter clicks]
1781625 1784041 There she is. What a beauty.
1784125 1785708 Come on down here, darling.
1788625 1791291 There we go. You just<br />stand right there for me.
1792208 1795083 Sheryl is an aspiring actress<br />from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
1795166 1796833 She used to work massaging feet,
1796916 1799708 but quit when her boss asked<br />her to work her way up.
1799791 1801750 She moved here from L.A.<br />after graduating college
1801833 1805375 and now is hoping to find a<br />Romeo to complement her Juliet.
1805458 1808333 My goodness, you are a beauty.<br />What a knockout. How you doing?
1808416 1810208 - Uh, doing well.<br />- Okay. Fantastic.
1810291 1812333 - Are you ready to get this party started?<br />- Yeah.
1812416 1814708 Okay, well, let the games begin.
1814791 1817541 - [cheering and applause]<br />- The rules of the game are simple.
1817625 1819958 There are three bachelors<br />behind this partition.
1820041 1823625 You can ask them whatever you like<br />except for their name, age or occupation.
1823708 1826041 At the end, you pick which<br />one you'd like to go out with.
1826125 1828208 - Sound good?<br />- Great.
1828291 1830416 [director] "A" camera, get<br />ready for the snap zoom.
1832416 1835250 Hi, Sheryl, pleased<br />to make your pleasure.
1835333 1838458 No, I mean, pleasure<br />to meet your, um…
1838541 1841833 - Save that talk for the date.<br />- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
1841916 1845125 There we go. Third time's a<br />charm. Bachelor number two?
1845208 1847125 Hello, Sheryl.
1847208 1850208 Hello, hello, hello.
1850291 1852291 If you want to groove,<br />pick number two.
1852375 1854291 [Sheryl] Oh, my God,<br />is he stuck like that?
1854375 1856125 [Ed] We'll have to find out.
1856208 1859875 And would you please say hello<br />to Sheryl, bachelor number three?
1859958 1861833 [director] Lights<br />up on number three.
1862375 1864708 We're gonna have a great<br />time together, Sheryl.
1864791 1866500 [audience exclaiming, laughing]
1866583 1867791 [Ed] He's confident.
1873416 1876375 Now you know what they sound like,<br />are you ready to take the next step?
1876458 1877333 I think I am.
1877416 1879166 - Do you have your question set?<br />- Sure do.
1879250 1881291 Let's take a seat and<br />make yourself comfortable.
1881375 1882916 And here we go.
1883000 1884333 [cheering and applause]
1884416 1886083 [upbeat music playing]
1888041 1890958 [director] Oh, Jesus, Ed.<br />Okay, cue the "applause" sign.
1894666 1896166 [applause stops]
1897125 1899125 Bachelor number one,
1899208 1901833 we're in a drama class<br />and it's the big audition.
1901916 1904583 You're a nerdy schoolboy<br />asking me out on a date.
1904666 1906041 Take it away.
1906125 1907833 - [woman] Ooh!<br />- Uh…
1909166 1912000 Hey, I… I'm a…
1913375 1917875 You know, I'm a nerdy schoolboy.<br />Do you want to go on a date?
1919833 1922333 - Is that it?<br />- [laughter]
1922416 1924583 - Yeah.<br />- [Ed] Well, we got a genius.
1924666 1925833 [director] Pan to number two.
1925916 1927291 I like it, bachelor number one.
1927375 1930666 Um, bachelor number two, you're<br />the captain of the football team.
1930750 1932291 - Go.<br />- [Laura gasping]
1932375 1934083 [bachelor 2] Hey<br />there, Peggy Sue…
1934166 1935583 Hey, you okay?
1935666 1937000 [Laura] Yeah, I'm fine.
1937083 1939458 [bachelor 2] I was thinking<br />if you weren't doing nothing,
1939541 1941458 maybe we could play a<br />game of touch football.
1941541 1943666 - I'd be shirts, you'd be skins.<br />- [audience exclaim]
1943750 1945875 [Sheryl] I don't know.<br />That sounds awfully rough.
1946500 1949500 [bachelor 2] Rough and rowdy,<br />that's the way I like it, babe.
1950458 1954208 Bachelor number three, you're<br />the accomplished professor.
1954291 1955458 Go for it.
1956208 1959333 Young lady, I'm gonna need<br />you to stay after class
1959416 1961333 and have a word with me.
1961416 1962500 [audience exclaiming]
1962583 1965583 Oh. Do you need to<br />teach me a lesson?
1965666 1968125 [Rodney] Yes. Yes, I do.
1968208 1970958 In fact, you're going<br />to have to bend over…
1972375 1974208 backwards with dedication.
1974291 1975916 [laughter]
1977666 1978833 [applause]
1982083 1985375 [Sheryl] Okay, um,<br />bachelor number one…
1985458 1988041 [indistinct chatter, laughter]
1989958 1991041 [gasps softly]
1991125 1993708 [Sheryl] If I served you for<br />dinner, what would you be?
1993791 1995583 [bachelor 1] Uh,<br />I am the buffet.
1995666 1997166 [laughter]
1997250 1999000 I gotta get out of here.
1999083 2002208 - Right now? It's the middle of the show.<br />- Gotta go to the bathroom.
2002291 2003291 Everything okay?
2003333 2005083 - Look, stop.<br />- Where's she going?
2005166 2007041 [Sheryl] Bachelor number two?
2007125 2010375 Oh, I'm a big old green salad<br />with the vinaigrette on the side,
2010458 2013791 - because I like things undressed.<br />- [audience exclaiming]
2014583 2016083 Ah, that's funny.
2022250 2023416 Bachelor number one…
2027291 2029791 - [all exclaiming]<br />- [gasps]
2030875 2032958 Jesus, what the fuck was that?
2033041 2035791 - [man 1] Guys, what was that?<br />- [man 2] Was that part of the show?
2036750 2037875 [man 3] What do we do?
2042291 2044750 [director] Somebody down<br />there get Ed's attention.
2047750 2049916 [man 1] Ed. Say something.
2050583 2053833 Uh, well, ladies and gentlemen,<br />that is the end of round one,
2053916 2057916 and I think we're going<br />to hear from our sponsors.
2058000 2059458 [microphone feedback whines]
2060416 2063250 - We'll be right back.<br />- Go to commercial. Go to two.
2064458 2066083 What the fuck was that?
2066166 2069166 [man] 'Kay, everyone, we're<br />resetting. Someone clean that up.
2069250 2070416 What the fuck was that?
2070500 2073875 Oh, baby, you're doing amazing.<br />Just knocking it out of the park.
2073958 2075041 Great.
2076583 2079916 Hey, the magic of<br />television. Huh? [laughs]
2080000 2082291 We got some time. Who's<br />here from out of town?
2082375 2084166 Hollywood, first time? Oh!
2084750 2087250 Bet you didn't think it<br />was gonna be that exciting.
2087333 2088875 [laughter]
2089500 2090833 Right, just clean this up.
2090916 2094041 [Lisa] Look, this is not my<br />job. She came from over there.
2096708 2098541 [hyperventilating]
2112208 2113958 [crying]
2118166 2119208 Goddamnit.
2120666 2122875 [imperceptible]
2124416 2125250 [yells]
2125333 2126666 [elevator bell dings]
2148583 2149875 Um, do you know where...
2149958 2153125 He's probably somewhere<br />upstairs holding court.
2156958 2159041 [Rodney] Yeah, I met her<br />at Warren Beatty's house.
2159125 2161875 [man] Warren Beatty's house.<br />Listen to this fucking guy.
2161958 2162791 [all laugh]
2162875 2164166 [Mario] Hey, uh, Rodney?
2165708 2167833 - This is the new guy, Mario, right?<br />- Yeah.
2167916 2169750 And her parents<br />let you take this?
2169833 2172458 Let me? [chuckles] They paid me.
2172541 2173708 No.
2173791 2177250 I can see it. I think it'd be great.<br />That's how the industry works.
2177333 2178958 [man] Yeah, I know how it works.
2180833 2182833 [indistinct chatter]
2192000 2194541 - She's just 13.<br />- Yeah, but, I mean, come on.
2194625 2195791 Girls these days…
2197000 2200541 You know, I took that one<br />in Malibu a few weeks ago.
2201375 2203583 Yeah. It's nice.
2205083 2208333 You know, I was just thinking<br />maybe going there later today.
2208416 2211208 I usually find my subject<br />at the beach, but…
2211291 2214541 You'd look great in that light,<br />so, you know, if you're around…
2216083 2219625 Yeah. Yeah. I mean,<br />I'm not… I'm not busy.
2219708 2221208 You're not busy.
2221291 2222958 I'm free whenever.
2226000 2228875 - Rod. Rod?<br />- [Rodney] Yeah?
2228958 2230625 Some people are here to see you.
2230708 2233250 - Yeah, who? Warren Beatty?<br />- [laughter]
2233333 2234791 It's the police.
2237416 2241416 Oh, yeah, no, um, my place,<br />it was jacked last week, so…
2242375 2244583 Some of the camera<br />equipment was lost.
2244666 2247416 They're probably just<br />following up on that, you know?
2247500 2249041 All right. See you guys later.
2253208 2254333 [man] Party's over.
2258541 2260291 [indistinct chatter]
2270833 2273583 [Rodney] Well, that's…<br />That's your job, right?
2273666 2274916 It's not my job.
2276541 2278541 [indistinct conversation]
2279583 2280583 [laughter]
2280625 2283625 Yeah. Yeah, you know, we always<br />gotta check these things out.
2283708 2285166 [Rodney] You're<br />just doing your job.
2285250 2286500 Sorry for the misunderstanding.
2286583 2288750 It's okay. Thank you,<br />guys. Appreciate it.
2290833 2291833 [sighs]
2293166 2295416 [hushed conversation]
2300500 2301791 [man clears throat]
2306500 2308500 [breath trembling]
2310833 2311916 Fuck.
2319166 2321166 - [faucet squeaks]<br />- [water running]
2333041 2334458 [man coughs]
2370750 2372125 - [zipper closes]<br />- [sniffles]
2372708 2373708 Hey.
2375000 2377208 Uh, so, um…
2377916 2379875 Later, I can't,
2379958 2382791 'cause they actually<br />want me to stay late
2382875 2384625 because I…
2384708 2387458 There's like, nobody<br />here. Short on staff.
2388916 2390000 Um…
2392208 2393208 Another time?
2396916 2398000 Yeah.
2399666 2401125 I'll find someone else.
2402583 2403583 Okay.
2407000 2408250 Sorry.
2411750 2415083 [door opens, closes]
2440958 2442041 [Laura] Alison?
2442125 2443708 [knock on door]
2443791 2445250 Al, are you in there?
2446083 2450375 Hey, Al, I've been calling for a while<br />and I'm just a little worried about you.
2452625 2454708 Okay, I'm gonna use the spare.
2454791 2458208 Now, I'm coming in, okay? If<br />you're in there, I'm coming in.
2459208 2461208 [breath trembling]
2469041 2471458 [indistinct chatter]
2477125 2479083 [man] Yeah, it's<br />all good. All good.
2482416 2484250 Excuse me.
2485416 2487041 Gotta work in here.
2487958 2490041 What'd I tell you? Lug nuts.
2490125 2492625 - How am I doing?<br />- You're great. Fabulous.
2494291 2496500 What is it? What's the matter?
2496583 2498083 [Sheryl] Oh, nothing. Nothing.
2498166 2501500 I'm trying to do what Ed said. Just<br />feels a little weird. That's all.
2501583 2502583 Oh, fuck Ed.
2503666 2505250 No disrespect, but fuck him.
2505333 2508125 This isn't a sitcom, you're<br />not coming back next week.
2508208 2509833 [Ed speaking indistinctly]
2509916 2512458 What's Ed gonna do? Fire you?
2512541 2513666 [chuckles]
2514333 2517625 You're supposed to be having<br />fun. That's the whole point.
2517708 2520958 So just be yourself.<br />Say whatever you want.
2521041 2523166 [indistinct chatter]
2526375 2527791 Do either of you have a pen?
2527875 2530333 - [woman] Yeah, here you go.<br />- Thank you.
2532333 2534166 [Marilyn] She looks fine.
2534875 2537250 - Yeah, she's gorgeous.<br />- Yeah.
2537333 2539666 [Marilyn] Yeah.<br />Look at these guys.
2539750 2541041 Thank you.
2541125 2542250 Don't mind if I do.
2543041 2544041 No, thanks.
2545166 2548125 [sighs] Too small.
2548208 2551208 Seriously, anything under<br />a C cup, can't do it.
2553208 2554458 What about her?
2556250 2557250 What about her?
2558375 2560708 You haven't seen her yet.<br />What if she's petite?
2561750 2563791 I'll let her blow me. [chuckles]
2563875 2565125 No, you won't.
2568458 2571250 I won't? And why is that?
2578875 2580791 Because I always get the girl.
2584375 2585375 [scoffs]
2593833 2595416 [director] You guys<br />all set down there?
2595500 2597750 Check in with Matthew<br />to see how close we are.
2599291 2601333 [man] He says he just<br />needs 30 seconds.
2603208 2605541 [director] "B" camera, come<br />on. We're up and running.
2605625 2607025 - [bell rings]<br />- In place, everyone.
2607083 2609958 Ladies, stop messing with her hair.<br />I know you're barely touching her.
2610041 2611041 We're ready for you.
2611125 2614125 - Don't let that throw you. You got this.<br />- Okay, Mr. Burke.
2614208 2617250 Hey, you guys good? You<br />need anything? Okay, great.
2619333 2620500 We're on.
2626750 2629083 [Ken] Laura. Are you okay?
2633125 2635833 - Hey.<br />- I know bachelor number three.
2638416 2639416 Oh.
2642541 2644041 Did you date him or something?
2646875 2650625 No, I didn't date him. I… He…
2652333 2653500 [exhales]
2660583 2664791 Do you remember my friend<br />Alison, the one who was…
2665583 2668791 Yeah. I remember you<br />talking about her.
2668875 2671625 And there was that<br />guy at the beach and…
2673666 2677541 I shouldn't have<br />left her there. I…
2681583 2683250 [crying]
2683333 2687958 I told her to be careful, and I<br />knew that there was something wrong.
2688041 2690041 I knew something was<br />off about that guy.
2690125 2694625 - You gave his description to the police.<br />- Yeah. That's the guy.
2699333 2701125 Bachelor number three?
2705166 2706333 Um…
2708708 2710458 How sure are you?
2710541 2711833 I'm pretty sure.
2712916 2715041 - Pretty sure?<br />- Like 90%.
2717000 2718583 But you're not positive.
2720708 2723666 I'm just saying this guy might<br />look really similar, right?
2726416 2728833 I'm not saying that I<br />don't believe you, Laura.
2730500 2733833 I mean, if this guy did<br />what you're implying, then…
2734708 2737166 wouldn't he be in jail<br />and not on a TV show?
2740458 2741666 I don't know. I...
2741750 2742833 It's a big TV show.
2742916 2744791 You don't think they<br />vet their contestants?
2746750 2748791 - I...<br />- Maybe it is the guy, right?
2748875 2752250 And maybe the police, they looked<br />into him and they cleared him.
2755666 2757000 Look, I love you.
2758708 2761416 And I'm really sorry that<br />you lost your friend.
2762375 2764083 It must feel like he's<br />around every corner.
2764166 2765875 I can't even imagine, but…
2767958 2769666 I'm just not sure what<br />you want me to do.
2769750 2770750 Get out.
2772166 2774166 - What?<br />- Get out.
2776416 2778166 - Laura...<br />- Now!
2787583 2788916 [exhales]
2801000 2803416 - Okay, everyone. Here we go. Look alive.<br />- [bell rings]
2803500 2807791 We're back into it in<br />five, four, three, two…
2807875 2810083 - [upbeat music playing]<br />- [applause]
2810166 2812625 [Ed] All right. Welcome<br />back to The Dating Game.
2812708 2815458 Thank you for bearing through<br />that, uh, technical difficulty.
2815541 2818583 Back to the show. Sheryl, the<br />floor is yours. Take it away.
2819708 2821208 Bachelor number one,
2821291 2824625 Einstein said that sitting on a hot<br />stove for a minute feels like an hour,
2824708 2827500 but sitting next to a nice girl<br />for an hour feels like a minute.
2827583 2830875 That was his theory of special<br />relativity. What's yours?
2832166 2833250 Um…
2834958 2836708 - What?<br />- [laughter]
2836791 2838208 I'll come back to you.
2838291 2840041 Wait. Was that the<br />actual question?
2840125 2842500 Bachelor number two, when you<br />invite a girl out for dinner,
2842583 2845791 - what do you expect in return?<br />- Ooh.
2845875 2846750 [bachelor 2] Uh…
2846833 2850750 I guess that depends on the meal.<br />Are we talking filet mignon, or what?
2850833 2852250 That's a good question, are we?
2852875 2855208 [bachelor 2] Yeah. Sure.<br />I'm a generous guy.
2855291 2857531 - Good to know.<br />- [man] Are these the scripted questions?
2857583 2859383 Since I'm spending an<br />arm and a leg on dinner,
2859458 2862541 I'd like to think that she could<br />at least provide the dessert.
2863208 2865583 Oh, and what would<br />you order for dessert?
2866416 2869500 - Oh, you know.<br />- No, I don't. Tell me.
2869583 2871083 [laughter]
2871166 2872916 [bachelor 2] Something hot.
2873000 2874666 Like cherries flambé?
2874750 2876625 Yeah, with lots<br />of whipped cream.
2876708 2878166 Sorry, I'm on a diet.
2878250 2881333 Bachelor number one, how's that theory<br />of special relativity coming along?
2881416 2883000 - Hmm?<br />- Groovy, keep at it.
2883083 2884208 Bachelor number three,
2884291 2886125 what's the difference<br />between a boy and a man?
2887375 2891333 A boy thinks that buying a woman<br />dinner means she owes him something.
2893208 2895291 Okay, and what does a man think?
2895375 2896500 Well, for starters,
2896583 2898958 he knows better than to<br />start talking about dessert
2899041 2900833 before he's made<br />it through dinner.
2900916 2902666 [audience applauding]
2902750 2904750 [Sheryl] That's not bad.
2904833 2906708 Bachelor number one, any luck?
2906791 2908625 [man] Keep up, she's<br />going back to the genius.
2908708 2909625 [bachelor 1] I can't.
2909708 2912500 Okay. Should I be taking<br />notes, teacher, or…
2912583 2915166 Oh, it will be on<br />the final exam, Ed.
2915250 2916666 - [laughter]<br />- That's good.
2916750 2919125 Bachelor number three, your<br />buddy's drawing a blank.
2919208 2920291 Want to help him out?
2920375 2922958 With his theory of<br />special relativity?
2923041 2924166 Yeah.
2925916 2929583 Whether it's for a<br />minute or for an hour,
2929666 2933166 I'd like to sit relatively<br />close to a special girl
2933958 2935250 whenever I get the chance.
2935333 2936666 How's that?
2936750 2939250 - That's pretty good. That's not bad.<br />- [applause]
2956416 2958375 [laughter and applause]
2958458 2961166 Bachelor number one, I threw<br />you a curveball last time.
2961250 2965041 I'll say. I didn't know I needed to<br />be an astrologer to be on this show.
2965666 2968166 - Do you mean an astronomer?<br />- Is there a difference?
2968250 2969791 Do you want there to be?
2970416 2972750 - Um, no.<br />- By the way,
2972833 2975791 Einstein was a physicist, not<br />an astronomer. Doesn't matter.
2975875 2977375 Are you gonna ask me a question?
2977458 2979041 I just asked you two, but sure.
2979125 2981833 In the Groundwork of the<br />Metaphysics of Morals,
2981916 2985000 - Immanuel Kant argues…<br />- [man] She'll give him a heart attack.
2985083 2986375 I don't… [scoffs]
2986458 2989000 I'm kidding. Bachelor<br />number one, I'm kidding.
2989625 2991291 I'm just having fun with you.
2991916 2994500 Bachelor number one,<br />this is nice and easy.
2996083 2997666 What are girls for?
3000000 3001500 Uh, what do you mean?
3001583 3004083 [Sheryl] Just what I<br />said. What are girls for?
3005416 3007041 Jeez, you're getting<br />edgy with this one.
3007125 3008916 Oh, want to go back<br />to Immanuel Kant?
3009000 3010166 No, no, I can do this.
3010250 3012958 Good to hear it. I believe<br />in you, bachelor number one.
3013041 3014291 Thank you.
3014375 3016708 Uh, girls are for…
3018666 3019666 guys.
3019750 3022416 And… you know, having fun with.
3022500 3024500 Well, Gloria Steinem<br />would be proud.
3024583 3026125 Being a little hard on the boys.
3026208 3028208 - I think we're all having fun.<br />- Of course.
3028291 3030458 - Aren't we having fun?<br />- [cheering and applause]
3030541 3031666 [Sheryl laughs]
3032500 3035791 See? We're having so<br />much fun. [chuckles]
3036666 3039833 Bachelor number two,<br />what are girls for?
3039916 3042541 Uh… Why does this<br />feel like a trap?
3042625 3044708 I don't know. Why does it?
3045625 3049750 Well, because if I say girls<br />are for wining and dining,
3049833 3051666 then I sound like a jerk,
3051750 3054541 and if I say they're for<br />respecting or whatever,
3054625 3057291 then I just sound like a<br />schmuck looking to get laid.
3057375 3060333 Okay, bachelor number two, I<br />think you answered my question.
3060416 3062541 Hey, wait. No, I didn't<br />mean it like that.
3062625 3063791 [Sheryl] Moving on.
3063875 3067041 Bachelor number three,<br />I'm counting on you.
3067125 3069208 What are girls for?
3074333 3076708 [guard] I… No. [chuckles]
3078875 3081750 No. No one's beaten Ali twice.
3082416 3083833 Yeah, I don't think so.
3083916 3087500 Uh, Jim, give me a second.<br />Can I help you with something?
3089000 3092416 Um, I need to speak with<br />someone on The Dating Game.
3092500 3094958 You want tickets, you need<br />go to guest relations.
3095041 3097000 Go back down the<br />hallway, take a right.
3097083 3099416 I don't want to see the<br />show. I just came from there.
3099500 3101708 I need to speak with<br />someone who works on it,
3101791 3103458 like a producer or something.
3104458 3105625 What for?
3107708 3112791 There's someone on the show<br />right now who shouldn't be there.
3112875 3116000 Who shouldn't be<br />there? Your boyfriend?
3116083 3117666 - No.<br />- Husband?
3118833 3120125 [sighs]
3122250 3125000 Last year, a friend of mine<br />was raped and murdered,
3125083 3127583 and the police never…
3129333 3132291 I think that the guy that killed<br />her is up on that stage right now.
3132375 3133500 Bachelor number three.
3133583 3138875 And this is a very dangerous man,<br />so can you just call someone for me?
3141000 3142083 Please.
3143458 3146458 Hey, Jim, I'm gonna have<br />to call you back. Yeah.
3150083 3151500 [Rodney] What are girls for?
3151583 3153000 [Sheryl] Yeah, that's right.
3154083 3158416 Hmm. I guess I'd have to say<br />that that's up to the girl.
3158500 3161125 - [applause]<br />- That's a very good answer.
3161208 3162583 Oh, yeah, we love that.
3165500 3166583 Um…
3168833 3171041 Bachelor number three, I<br />have a follow-up question.
3171125 3172000 Shoot.
3172083 3174583 You've been with the other<br />bachelors for a while now.
3174666 3176666 We've talked for a bit, yeah.
3176750 3179708 Okay. Tell me, what's<br />the most disgusting thing
3179791 3182708 bachelors one and two have<br />said or done backstage?
3182791 3185125 Besides coming on<br />this show, of course.
3185208 3186041 That's good.
3186125 3187291 [Rodney] Oh, gosh. Um…
3188333 3190708 That's a tough one.<br />If I'm being honest,
3190791 3193791 bachelor number one didn't<br />really say anything disgusting.
3193875 3196625 - That's, uh… That's true. I didn't.<br />- [laughter]
3196708 3198791 And what about<br />bachelor number two?
3199416 3204833 Um, I can't repeat it word for word as<br />how we're on television and all, but…
3205750 3208833 he had some thoughts<br />about bra sizes
3208916 3211416 being a prerequisite for<br />a meaningful relationship.
3212208 3214375 Oh. Is that right?
3215083 3218041 Oh, darn it, that signals<br />the end of our game.
3218125 3220791 - [upbeat music playing]<br />- Sheryl, it's time to make a decision.
3220875 3223375 Why don't you sit right<br />there, analyze what you heard?
3223458 3225541 We're going to take<br />a little time for you
3225625 3227791 to make a decision about<br />the very fine products…
3228541 3231833 You can wait in the office here.<br />Someone will be with you shortly.
3232500 3233708 [Laura] Who?
3233791 3236666 George Elliot. Series producer.
3238708 3240333 You can have a seat if you like.
3244416 3246875 He'll be able to<br />help you. Good luck.
3247625 3248625 Thank you.
3249791 3251541 - Really.<br />- [door opens]
3252458 3254625 [Ed] And we'll be right back.
3254708 3257208 - [director] And we're out.<br />- [bell ringing]
3258125 3260000 After the show, I want<br />this cunt out of here.
3260083 3261416 I never want to see her again.
3261500 3263083 I know. I'm so sorry, sir.
3264250 3266166 [woman] So who you gonna pick?
3266250 3268916 - Oh, knock it off.<br />- What? I'm just asking.
3269000 3270416 Do you think I went too far?
3270500 3273250 [chuckles] I think he<br />thinks you went too far.
3273333 3275125 [woman] He thinks<br />everything is too far.
3275208 3276250 [Marilyn chuckles]
3277208 3278458 Yeah, but do you, though?
3279041 3281833 Honey, I've been on<br />the show since 1968
3281916 3285250 and I've seen more idiots flirting<br />back and forth than I can count.
3285791 3289125 The one thing I've learned is<br />no matter what words they use,
3289208 3292000 the question beneath the<br />question remains the same.
3294375 3296791 All right. What's the question?
3297541 3299041 Which one of you will hurt me?
3300833 3303000 You just asked it<br />clearer than most.
3310750 3312708 Hey, man, what the fuck?
3312791 3314416 Why would you tell her that?
3315375 3316375 She asked.
3317541 3318666 Fuck you.
3319583 3323583 You know what? Soon as this show's over,<br />you and me, we're gonna have words.
3323666 3324791 Is that right?
3326875 3328375 Well, what if I don't show?
3328958 3331041 You gonna hire somebody<br />to track me down?
3331125 3333208 [scoffs] Fucking pussy.
3334000 3336500 You know what? I<br />have a better idea.
3336583 3340250 Why don't we swap contact information<br />so we know where to find each other?
3341750 3343291 Okay. Yeah.
3347916 3351333 Stocker Street, Glendale.<br />Yeah, I know where that is.
3352291 3353375 Here.
3356583 3359833 - Jesus, what the fuck is that, man?<br />- [chuckles]
3365416 3367666 - It's fake.<br />- [exhales sharply]
3367750 3369791 You fucking weirdo.
3369875 3371166 Yeah.
3385833 3386916 [door opens]
3404666 3406500 [man] All right, folks,<br />everyone in place.
3406583 3408125 [bell rings]
3408208 3410875 - [indistinct chatter]<br />- That's enough. Let's get out of here.
3410958 3412625 Let's move this<br />chair. Get up, Sheryl.
3412708 3416333 We've had an entire commercial break<br />to get rid of this. Come on. Go.
3416416 3417500 Here, right there.
3417583 3419791 - [man] And five, four, three, two…<br />- Go, go.
3419875 3421958 - Boys are babies, right?<br />- [scoffs]
3422041 3424458 [clears throat] Welcome<br />back to The Dating Game.
3424541 3426916 Sheryl, you have played<br />this game beautifully,
3427000 3429000 but now it is time<br />to make a decision.
3429083 3432958 Our bachelors were cool,<br />candid, sharp and, uh, patient,
3433041 3435000 but only one of them<br />can get the date.
3435083 3436833 Will it be bachelor number one,
3436916 3439625 bachelor number two or<br />bachelor number three?
3439708 3441541 Sheryl, who is the lucky guy?
3442125 3444291 - Number three.<br />- Number three.
3444375 3446500 My, my, my. Let me<br />ask you, Sheryl,
3446583 3449125 what about number three<br />appealed to you the most?
3449208 3450625 He knows what girls are for.
3450708 3452916 [Ed] He knows what<br />girls are for.
3453000 3454500 Before we meet<br />bachelor number three,
3454583 3456458 let me introduce you<br />to bachelor number one.
3456541 3457666 From Sherman Oaks,
3457750 3460416 he is a medical intern and<br />desires to own his own practice.
3460500 3462583 His hobbies include<br />reading and golf.
3462666 3464916 Please welcome Josh Young.
3465000 3466833 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Nice to meet you.
3466916 3468750 Wonderful job. Marvelous job.
3468833 3472000 Bachelor number two is a<br />furniture designer from Glendale
3472083 3474208 who enjoys Frisbee and dancing.
3474291 3476750 Sheryl, please meet Arnie Aslan.
3476833 3479333 [audience applauding]
3479416 3481000 [Arnie] Careful<br />with that asshole.
3481083 3482166 [Ed] Thank you, gentlemen.
3482250 3485416 We have some very fine parting<br />gifts for you right out this way.
3486541 3489791 It is time to come face to face<br />with the bachelor you did choose,
3489875 3492416 but, first, I'd like to tell<br />you a little bit about him.
3493125 3496666 Bachelor number three hails<br />from the great state of Texas.
3496750 3500541 He's a skydiver, into motorcycling,<br />and is a fine photographer.
3500625 3503250 Please welcome Rodney Alcala.
3503333 3505333 [cheering and applause]
3508791 3510250 - How are you?<br />- Nice to meet you.
3510333 3512375 - Nice to meet you.<br />- So nice to meet you.
3512458 3513875 [Ed] Well, you did it, Rodney.
3513958 3516916 You offered some great answers<br />to some very tricky questions
3517000 3518666 - and you got the girl.<br />- Thanks, Ed.
3518750 3520708 [Ed] Rodney and<br />Sheryl, pack your bags,
3520791 3524333 you're going on an all-expense<br />paid trip to Carmel, California.
3524416 3525666 Thanks for joining us.
3525750 3527958 We'll see you next time<br />on The Dating Game.
3528041 3529583 [man] And we're out.
3529666 3532541 - [man] Great job, sir. Follow me.<br />- [Lisa] Sheryl, sweetie?
3532625 3536333 This way. Watch your step here. Just<br />go through this door. Thank you.
3537458 3539458 [vacuum cleaner whirring]
3557708 3558708 Excuse me?
3560833 3563541 Hi, I'm sorry to bother you. Um…
3564333 3567958 I'm supposed to meet with someone<br />named George Elliot. He's a producer.
3568041 3568958 I beg your pardon?
3569041 3572791 George Elliot. He's an executive<br />producer on The Dating Game.
3572875 3575250 Do you know where<br />I could find him?
3575333 3577625 It's very important<br />that I speak with him.
3577708 3579416 I doubt that very much.
3580375 3581458 Why?
3583750 3585333 Because I'm George Elliot.
3589750 3590875 What?
3591541 3592750 Let me guess.
3593541 3596125 Security guard out front,<br />he set this up, yeah?
3598291 3600375 He is a real asshole, all right.
3606708 3607541 Excuse me.
3607625 3610458 If there's something I can<br />do, I'd be happy to try and...
3616375 3618500 Thank you so much<br />again. Did you have fun?
3618583 3621083 - Yeah, I had a lot of fun.<br />- Okay, right this way.
3621166 3623625 - This way? Got it.<br />- Just around this corner here.
3623708 3626375 - I thought it went really well.<br />- I think so too.
3626458 3628541 Now, safe travels.<br />We'll be in touch.
3628625 3631625 Thank you so much. [chuckles]
3637916 3639000 Sheryl?
3640375 3642666 Hi. Hey.
3643333 3644500 I lost you back there.
3644583 3648291 Yeah, I looked for you after<br />I changed, but that was crazy.
3649166 3651708 - The whole thing was crazy.<br />- [both chuckling]
3651791 3655750 They shoved me on stage, the<br />lights went on and here we go.
3655833 3658375 Yeah. Yeah.
3659791 3661166 It was kind of fun.
3661250 3666083 I mean, it was evil and soul-crushing,<br />but… I had a little fun.
3667166 3668375 Yeah.
3669833 3674791 But, yeah, uh, I guess<br />I'll see you in Carmel.
3674875 3675875 [Rodney chuckles]
3675958 3678500 I mean, do you wanna<br />go somewhere now?
3684250 3685666 [Amy] No fucking way.
3686833 3688250 This is beautiful.
3693083 3694166 [Rodney] Hey.
3695291 3696666 You want some?
3696750 3697791 Hell yeah.
3699625 3702708 Man, who would have thought that<br />I'd found the love of my life today?
3702791 3706625 [coughing] Don't make me<br />fucking laugh, you asshole.
3706708 3707875 Take it easy.
3720208 3721375 Is that your stuff?
3722500 3724250 Yeah, that's some of my work.
3726458 3728458 Let's see what I'm working with.
3738000 3739000 Wow.
3740375 3741375 These are, um…
3742000 3743541 I won 500 with that one.
3745291 3746458 No shit.
3747208 3748291 Yep.
3757875 3759958 All right, well,<br />enough of this crap.
3761000 3763333 Why don't you spill it<br />out? Where are you from?
3764708 3765916 Why do you want to know?
3766000 3767375 Why are you not telling me?
3768416 3770625 Maybe because I didn't<br />fucking like it there.
3771250 3772750 Ah, okay.
3773500 3775333 So you're a runaway.
3776166 3777416 Oh, my God.
3778208 3780625 You make me sound like<br />I'm Oliver-fucking-Twist.
3782166 3783583 I'm independent.
3785583 3788416 Your folks, they<br />must be worried.
3791791 3794166 Tammy's too loaded to<br />worry about anything.
3795541 3798083 What about your<br />dad? Where's he at?
3799291 3800416 Who knows?
3801166 3802791 He took off when I was a kid.
3803833 3805208 That must have been tough.
3806375 3808416 You know, growing<br />up without him.
3810208 3811541 Oh, please.
3813416 3815250 When did your dad<br />walk out on you?
3816791 3818416 Did you make it to eighth grade?
3828416 3830083 Did you ever try to find him?
3830166 3831166 [scoffs]
3831208 3834125 No. I'm afraid I'd kill him.
3838125 3841541 It's amazing how one selfish asshole<br />can fuck up your entire life.
3855041 3856041 Here.
3857750 3858875 What is this?
3859625 3860916 It's chocolate.
3861958 3863125 What's it for?
3864666 3865916 It's Valentine's Day.
3868083 3869583 You're my valentine.
3885041 3886750 That looks pretty far.
3886833 3888583 It's not. It's<br />just up that hill.
3889291 3890291 Hill?
3892208 3894291 - You wearing comfortable shoes?<br />- Yeah.
3894375 3896958 Good, 'cause you'll need 'em.
3902041 3903208 You ready?
3904083 3906375 - Yeah.<br />- All right, follow me.
3909416 3910625 Almost there.
3911500 3912916 Sun's going down too.
3913000 3914583 [Amy] Where do you<br />want me to stand?
3914666 3917166 [Rodney] Just keep going<br />that way, by the rock.
3917250 3918333 [Amy] This one?
3918416 3919916 [Rodney] Just keep going.
3923541 3924958 Yeah, right by the edge.
3925500 3926791 There, that's nice.
3932583 3934333 [camera shutter clicking]
3936333 3938083 Now turn around, face the light.
3942416 3943875 Yeah, that's beautiful.
3947583 3948916 You're a natural.
3952583 3953958 All right, just one more.
3960666 3962416 Now look up straight to the sky.
3973208 3974625 Did you get the shot?
3980208 3981208 Rodney?
3983208 3984708 [glass breaks]
3984791 3988333 Oh, my God, where are<br />we? What is this place?
3988416 3990208 - [laughs]<br />- I don't know,
3990291 3993125 but this is what happens when<br />a pretty girl like yourself
3993208 3995458 tells me to duck into<br />the first place I find.
3995541 3996625 Oh, my God.
3997208 3999500 I thought it looked<br />normal from the outside.
4002166 4004750 - What are you reading?<br />- Oh, uh…
4005416 4008000 Uh, Cowboy Mouth.<br />It's this play.
4008083 4009500 Sam Shepard, Patti Smith.
4010375 4011500 Yeah.
4011583 4013833 I saw the… The original run.
4013916 4016083 Really? So you<br />lived in New York.
4016166 4017708 Yeah, NYU.
4017791 4019291 - Columbia.<br />- Mmm.
4020000 4022041 I probably passed<br />you on the subway.
4022125 4025000 Mmm. I think I<br />would remember you.
4027125 4028166 Um…
4029666 4032791 Sometimes it's necessary to go<br />a long distance out of the way
4032875 4035291 in order to come back a<br />short distance correctly.
4036125 4037666 Is that Cowboy Mouth or…
4037750 4039708 Oh, no, The Zoo Story.
4039791 4041708 Ah, that's right. Oh, my God.
4042583 4044583 It's such a beautiful piece.
4044666 4046041 - You know it?<br />- Yeah.
4046125 4049000 Yeah. Yeah, Albee's<br />an incredible writer.
4049083 4051541 He is. He's, um… He's a genius.
4051625 4053875 You know, he's actually…<br />It's one of my favorites.
4055125 4056750 Wow, you know your stuff.
4058333 4059541 Um…
4060125 4062833 Anyway, there's a<br />production of Cowboy Mouth
4062916 4067708 that's going up at the Odyssey, so<br />I'm auditioning in, like, a week.
4067791 4068916 Cool.
4069000 4072166 - Well, I can't wait to see you in that.<br />- [chuckles softly]
4072250 4075041 - Yeah, I don't have the part yet.<br />- It's in the bag.
4075125 4076958 - Oh, yeah, you think so?<br />- Yeah, for sure.
4077041 4080000 I mean you have this Patti<br />Smith vibration thing going on.
4080083 4081375 [Sheryl chuckles]
4082250 4086166 That's sweet. I could not have less<br />of a Patti Smith vibration going on.
4086833 4089625 [chuckles softly] I'm<br />not talking about this.
4090208 4094416 I'm talking about…<br />soul, you know?
4096083 4097166 Okay. [chuckles]
4099541 4102791 That's very far out. [laughs]
4107083 4109791 I mean, it's… I<br />think that's good.
4110708 4112291 That's good. I'm into that.
4125750 4128583 I'm probably making this<br />harder than it has to be.
4133208 4136458 I don't date much. I don't<br />date at all, actually.
4141333 4143750 But you decided to go<br />to The Dating Game.
4149541 4151166 Yeah, that's funny. Um…
4155333 4157500 My agent said it<br />would get me seen.
4158208 4160416 "It's good exposure.<br />It'll get you seen."
4162416 4163416 [scoffs]
4167500 4168791 Did you feel seen?
4173500 4175000 I felt looked at.
4177500 4179375 How do you feel right now?
4184291 4185375 Fine.
4187250 4189666 Fine. [chuckles]
4196208 4198541 You know, most people<br />don't like to be seen.
4200416 4201583 They're afraid.
4202875 4205375 Because you have to be<br />comfortable with yourself.
4207083 4209041 You have to stop performing.
4210750 4211750 Hmm.
4212375 4213875 I never hide who I am.
4215916 4219041 Excuse me, ma'am? Can you<br />give us another round?
4219791 4220958 We had the mai tais.
4225250 4228416 Sorry, you missed last<br />call. We're just closing up.
4230000 4231166 That's a shame.
4233916 4236958 Well, I guess we'll have to<br />get out of here then, huh?
4242791 4243791 Yeah.
4263583 4265750 - Parked back at the lot?<br />- Yeah.
4266791 4268291 I'll walk with you.
4275583 4276833 What's your number?
4278083 4281208 I figure we have to connect<br />before we go to Carmel, so…
4282291 4283708 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
4302333 4303708 Something wrong?
4306500 4307708 No.
4311583 4312666 Thanks.
4333958 4335041 Good night.
4348125 4349125 Hey.
4351041 4352458 Can you tell me your number?
4353791 4356333 - I just gave it to you.<br />- Yeah, no, I know, I just…
4356416 4358250 want to make sure I<br />have the right one.
4358333 4362041 You know, sometimes the fours,<br />they kind of look like nines.
4364250 4365250 Right. Um…
4368708 4370333 Yeah, just let me<br />see it and I...
4370416 4371708 You can't repeat it from memory?
4380750 4384125 So I guess this means we're not<br />really meeting up in Carmel anymore?
4387583 4389208 I'm not going anywhere with you.
4392208 4393333 All right.
4394541 4395541 Fair enough.
4400291 4402708 Maybe I'll see you around.
4405250 4406666 Yeah, maybe.
4409541 4412125 [softly] Then you'd get<br />your fucking head bashed in.
4420250 4421333 What?
4442000 4444291 [Sheryl breathing heavily]
4462166 4463250 [softly] Fuck.
4472166 4474375 Fuck. Fuck.
4475208 4476208 Fuck.
4482166 4483916 Get your fucking<br />hand off my car.
4486625 4489250 - [door opens]<br />- [men chattering]
4509250 4511666 [breathing heavily]
4528791 4530375 [engine starts]
4549041 4550208 Fuck.
4565083 4566291 [bell ringing]
4567166 4569125 [children chattering, laughing]
4569208 4570125 [Laura] So great.
4570208 4572625 Sarah, can you save<br />that for later? Thanks.
4574750 4577000 Really good. Yeah, try one more.
4621041 4622125 You ready?
4631875 4633166 [Laura] Yeah, I did.
4633250 4636041 I did file a report in<br />December of last year,
4636125 4640583 and I don't know what else to tell…<br />This man, he was on national television.
4640666 4643583 Look, I don't know who<br />you spoke with, all right?
4643666 4646000 I… I don't know who<br />I spoke with either.
4646083 4648083 How many... Forget it.
4650708 4652875 Do your fucking job!
4654791 4655958 Fuck!
4657000 4659500 - [female officer] Ma'am?<br />- [Laura] Sorry. I'm going.
4660666 4663500 [Helen] Sheryl, sweetie, I<br />think you're making a mistake.
4663583 4665083 [Sheryl] I can<br />appreciate that, Helen.
4665166 4667500 [Helen] Right now MGM is<br />looking for an unknown brunette
4667583 4669291 for this big<br />thriller they've got,
4669375 4672083 and they do want to see a swimsuit<br />photo before you can audition...
4672166 4675126 - [Sheryl] I'm not gonna do that.<br />- I'll see if they can make an exception.
4675166 4677750 [Sheryl] No, not just<br />this audition, all of it.
4677833 4680125 [Helen] Don't be the girl<br />who was on one stupid TV show
4680208 4682375 and was never seen again.<br />You're better than that.
4682458 4684833 [Sheryl chuckles] Yeah, I know.
4685875 4688250 Listen, I'm really sorry<br />that it didn't work out
4688333 4690416 and I appreciate<br />everything, I really do.
4691083 4692083 Um…
4693583 4694750 Bye, Helen.
4702166 4703500 I just, um…
4705833 4706833 Okay.
4723958 4725958 This is everything,<br />so we're good to go.
4749083 4751500 [wind whistling]
4767708 4769625 [Rodney crying]
4827875 4829875 [continues crying]
4842875 4844041 Hey.
4850291 4851958 Hey, are you okay?
4858666 4861166 I guess things got<br />pretty crazy last night.
4870666 4872791 Do you think that you<br />could do me a favor?
4875750 4878750 Do you think that you could<br />not tell anyone about this?
4880083 4881083 Please?
4889000 4892416 I would just be so<br />fucking embarrassed.
4895208 4897500 You know how judgmental<br />people can be.
4906208 4907458 Thank you.
4912375 4913416 So…
4915666 4917833 Do you want to go<br />back to your place?
4925208 4926291 Okay.
4928333 4929333 Cool.
4931166 4932791 Can you help me with these?
4942916 4944750 Someone knows how to tie a knot.
4953708 4955875 Something tells me<br />you were a Boy Scout.
5001708 5003166 [Rodney] Hey, um…
5004041 5005791 I just wanted to say…
5009375 5012166 I'm sorry if I was rough<br />with you back there.
5015916 5017375 It's okay, baby.
5019166 5020541 Everything's okay.
5040583 5042416 [engine starts]
5091041 5093750 [Rodney breathes deeply]
5123458 5126333 I'm gonna take a leak.<br />You want something?
5126416 5128083 - I'm okay.<br />- Okay.
5171083 5172833 - [faucet squeaks]<br />- [water running]
5229833 5232541 [sirens wailing]
5261625 5263166 [sirens stop]
5267083 5268166 [car doors closing]
5268250 5270666 [officers shouting indistinctly]
5280250 5282850 - [officer 1] Don't move!<br />- [officer 2] Hands where I can see 'em.
5282916 5284458 [officer 3] Get on<br />the fucking ground!
5284541 5286181 - [handcuffs clicking]<br />- [Rodney grunting]
5287125 5288666 Tony, call for backup!
5288750 5291590 - Get the cuffs. Hold his legs down.<br />- Get your fucking hands off of me!
5291625 5294041 - Stop resisting.<br />- Don't do this. Let go.
5294125 5295125 Dave, get him.
5295208 5298333 [officer 4] We're out by mile marker<br />112. We need assistance immediately.
5298416 5299291 [officer 3] Okay.
5299375 5300750 [officer 4] Take a breath.
5300833 5302250 [officer 2] He's… He's done.
5305333 5307625 [breathing shakily]
5307708 5309625 [indistinct police<br />radio chatter]
5309708 5310708 [gasps]
