68151 70946 <i>- Troy, you ought to stop that lying.<br />- I ain't lying.</i>
71029 72739 <i>Nigger had a watermelon this big,</i>
72823 74700 <i>talking about,<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>
74783 77494 <i>I'd like to fell out.<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>
77661 79371 And it sitting there, big as life.
79454 81540 - What Mr. Rand say?<br />- He ain't said nothing.
81623 84251 He figure, if the nigger was too dumb to<br />know he's carrying a watermelon,
84334 86128 he wasn't going to get<br />much sense out of him.
86211 89006 Trying to hide that great, big,<br />old watermelon under his coat.
89089 91592 Afraid to let the white man<br />see him carry it home.
92050 94469 I'm like you.<br />I ain't got no time for them kinda people.
94553 96096 Now, what he look like getting mad
96179 98140 'cause he seen the man from the union<br />talking to Mr. Rand?
98223 101476 He come up to me, talking about<br />"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."
101560 103770 I told him, "Get away from me with that."
103854 106315 He walked away from me<br />calling you a troublemaker.
106690 108358 What Mr. Rand say?
108442 110110 He ain't said nothing.<br />Told me to go down
110193 111987 to the Commissioner's office<br />next Friday.
112362 113697 They called me down there to see them.
113780 116033 Well, as long as<br />you got your complaint filed,
116116 117200 they can't fire you.
117284 118619 That's what one of them<br />white fellas tell me.
118702 119911 I ain't worried about them firing me.
119995 122289 What, they gonna fire me<br />'cause I asked a question?
122372 123457 That's all I did.
123540 125584 I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.
125667 126668 I asked him, "Why?
126752 128962 "Why you got all the white mens driving,<br />and the colored lifting?"
129046 130964 Told him, "What's the matter?<br />Don't I count?
131048 133050 "Think only white fellows<br />got sense enough to drive a truck?"
133133 135385 "Hell, that ain't no paper job.<br />Anybody can drive a truck.
135469 137679 "How come you got all the whites driving<br />and the colored lifting?"
140390 143060 He told me, "Take it to the union."<br />Well, hell, that's what I done.
143143 145312 Now they want to come up<br />with this pack of lies.
145395 147856 I told Brownie if the man<br />come and ask him any questions,
147939 149232 just tell the truth.
149316 151068 Ain't nothing but somebody<br />trumped it up on you
151151 152277 'cause you filed a complaint on.
152361 153654 Brownie ain't got that much sense.
153737 154905 Man wasn't thinking about nothing.
154988 156823 All I want them to do<br />is change the job description,
156907 158575 give everybody a chance<br />to drive the truck.
160577 163246 Brownie can't see that.<br />He ain't got that much sense.
184393 185727 How you figure he be making out
185811 188230 with that gal,<br />be up in Taylors' all the time?
188313 190023 - That Alberta gal?<br />- Who?
190107 191441 Brownie.
191525 193902 Same as you and me,<br />getting about as much as we is.
193985 196488 - Which is to say nothing.<br />- It is, huh?
196571 199074 Well, I figure<br />you doing a little better than me.
199157 200701 And I ain't saying what I'm doing!
201034 202661 Nigger, look here. I know you.
202744 204705 If you had gotten anywhere<br />near that gal,
204788 207040 20 minutes later,<br />you'd be looking to tell somebody.
207124 208500 And the first one you gonna want to tell,
208583 210544 that you gonna want to brag to<br />is going to be me.
210627 213046 I ain't saying that.
213130 215173 I see where you be eyeing her.
215257 217634 I eye all the women.<br />I don't miss nothing.
217718 219928 Don't never let nobody tell you<br />Troy Maxson don't eye the women.
220011 221304 Hey, you been doing<br />more than eyeing her.
221388 222597 You done bought her a drink or two.
222681 224015 Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink.<br />What that mean?
224099 225267 I bought you one, too.
225350 227018 What that mean,<br />'cause I buy her a drink?
227102 229479 - I'm just being polite.<br />- It's all right to buy her one drink.
229563 231273 That's what you call being polite.
231356 233066 But when you want to be<br />buying two or three,
233150 234568 that's what you call eyeing her.
234651 236319 Look here. As long as you've known me,
236403 238280 you ever known me<br />to chase after women?
238363 242075 Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.<br />You're forgetting, I knew you when.
242159 244911 I'm talking about<br />since I been married to Rose.
244995 246413 Not since you been married to Rose.
246496 249666 - That's the truth, though. I can say that.<br />- All right then. Case closed.
250333 253044 I see you be walking up<br />around Alberta's house.
253128 255922 You supposed to be at Taylors',<br />and you be walking up around there.
256006 257090 What you watching where<br />I'm walking for?
257174 258300 I don't be watching after you.
258383 260302 No, I seen you walking<br />around there more than once.
260385 261762 Hell, you liable<br />to see me walking anywhere.
261845 263805 That don't mean nothing 'cause<br />you seen me walking around there.
263889 265098 Where'd she come from, anyway?
265182 266433 She just kinda showed up one day.
266516 269853 Tallahassee. You can look at that<br />and tell she one of them Florida gals.
269936 272147 They got some big,<br />healthy women down there.
272230 274065 Grow them right up out of the ground.
274149 275734 She got a little bit of Indian in her.
275817 277694 Most of them niggers in Florida<br />got some Indian in them.
277778 279780 Yeah, I don't know<br />about that Indian part,
279863 282824 but she damn sure big and healthy.
282908 284951 Woman wears some big stockings.
285035 289206 Got them crazy big legs,<br />and hips wide as the Mississippi River.
289289 290749 Legs don't mean nothing.
290832 292459 You don't do nothing<br />but push 'em out of the way.
292542 294127 But them hips,
294211 297172 - they cushion the ride.<br />- Troy, you ain't got no sense!
297255 300258 It's the truth.<br />Like you riding on Goodyears!
303386 305347 What you all out here getting into?
305430 307724 What you worried about<br />what we getting into for, woman?
307808 308850 This is men talk.
308934 310227 What I care<br />what you all are talking about?
310310 311686 Bono, you gonna stay for supper?
311770 313063 No, thank you, Rose,
313146 315440 but Lucille say she cooking up<br />a pot of pigfeet.
315524 317567 Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.
317651 319986 I might even stay the night,<br />you got some pigfeet.
320070 321863 You got something in there<br />to top them pigfeet, Rose?
321947 324199 I'm cooking up some chicken.<br />I got some chicken and collard greens.
324282 325492 Well, you go on back in the house.
325575 326868 Let me and Bono<br />finish what we talking about.
326952 329663 This is men talk.<br />I got some talk for you later.
329746 331748 And you know what kind of talk<br />I mean, too.
331832 333333 You go on in there and powder it up.
333416 334793 Troy, stop it!
336086 337671 Woman, come here.
338964 341174 Look here, Bono.
341258 343677 When I first met this woman,
343760 345554 I got out that place.
345637 348598 <i>Hitch up my pony<br />Saddle up my mare</i>
348682 351309 <i>There's a woman out there<br />for me somewhere</i>
351393 355313 I looked at here, looked at there,<br />saw Rose, and I latched on to her.
355397 358817 I latched on to her and I told her...<br />Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.
359067 363363 I latched on to her and told her,<br />"Baby, I don't want to marry.
363446 365073 "I just want to be your man."
365156 367617 Rose told me...<br />Tell him what you told me, Ro.
367701 369536 I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,
369619 371830 then move out of the way,<br />so the marrying kind could find me.
371913 374374 That's what she told me,<br />"Nigger, you in my way.
374457 375750 "You blocking the view.
375834 377794 "Move out the way,<br />so I can find me a husband."
377878 380338 - I thought it over 2-3 days.<br />- Two-three days, nothing.
380422 381882 You was back the same night.
381965 384134 I come back, told her, "Okay, baby,
384217 386011 "but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster
386094 387721 "and put him out there in the backyard.
387804 389222 "And when he see a stranger come,
389306 390724 "he gonna flap his wings and crow."
390807 392893 Look here, Bono. I done<br />watched that front door by myself.
392976 395729 It was that<br />back door I was worried about.
395812 398231 Don't talk like that!<br />Troy, you're not but telling a lie.
398565 402652 Only thing was, we first got married,<br />forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.
402736 403862 I hear you tell it.
403945 406364 Me and Lucille was staying<br />down there on Logan Street.
406448 408909 Had two rooms<br />with the outhouse in the back.
408992 410619 I ain't mind the outhouse none.
410702 413204 But when that goddamn wind<br />blew through there in the winter,
413288 414998 that's what I'm talking about!
415332 419210 To this day, I wonder why the hell I ever<br />stayed down there for six long years.
419294 421755 But, see,<br />I didn't know I could do no better.
421838 424549 I thought only white folks<br />had inside toilets and things.
424633 425842 A lot of folks don't think
425926 427469 they can do no better<br />than they're doing now.
427552 430680 Just something you gotta learn.<br />A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.
430764 432349 Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.<br />She got fresh food.
432432 434267 I ain't said nothing about<br />if she got fresh food.
434351 435685 I'm talking about what she charge.
435769 437646 She charges 10 cents<br />more than the A&P.
437729 439272 A&P ain't never done nothing for me.
439356 441191 I spend my money<br />where I'm treated right.
441274 442609 I go down to Bella, say,
442692 445111 "I need a loaf of bread, I'll pay you<br />Friday," she gives it to me.
445195 447030 What sense that make<br />when I got money
447113 448448 to spend it somewhere else
448531 450116 and ignore the person<br />who done right by me?
450200 451242 That ain't in the Bible.
451326 452619 We ain't talking about<br />what's in the Bible.
452702 454871 What sense it make to shop there<br />when she overcharges?
454955 456456 Well, you do your shopping<br />where you want to,
456539 458083 I do my shopping<br />where people been good to me.
458166 460126 I don't think it's right for her<br />to overcharge, that's all.
460210 461378 Look here, I got to be getting on.
461461 462879 Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.
463004 464547 Where you going, nigger?<br />We ain't finished this pint.
464631 465757 Come here finish this pint.
465924 469803 Well, hell, I am,<br />if you ever turn the bottle loose.
469886 474224 Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,<br />I'm glad Cory got that job down there.
474516 476101 Help him with<br />his school clothes and things.
476184 478520 Gabe done moved out,<br />things getting tight around here.
478603 479854 He got that job,
479938 481481 he can start to look out for himself.
481564 484818 Cory done got recruited<br />by a college football team.
484901 488029 I told that boy about<br />that college football stuff.
488113 490907 The white man ain't gonna let<br />him get nowhere with that football.
490991 492993 I told him<br />when he first come to me with it.
493076 495662 Now, you come telling me<br />he done got more tied up in it.
495745 497831 He ought to get recruited<br />in how to fix cars,
497914 499124 or some way he can make a living.
499249 501626 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
501710 503712 It's just something<br />the boys in school do.
503795 505922 They're gonna send a recruiter by<br />to talk to you. He'll tell you.
506006 508008 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
508091 509592 It's an honor to be recruited.
509676 512137 It ain't gonna get him nowhere,<br />Bono'll tell you that.
512429 515473 If he be like you in sports,<br />he gonna be all right.
515557 518059 Ain't but two men ever played<br />baseball good as you.
518143 520186 That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.
520270 522439 Them the only two men ever<br />hit more home runs than you.
522522 524816 And what it ever get me?<br />I ain't got a pot to piss in,
524899 526192 or a window to throw it out of.
526276 528028 Times have changed since<br />you were playing baseball, Troy.
528111 530155 That was before the war.<br />Times have changed a lot since then.
530238 531322 How the hell they done changed?
531406 532907 They got a lot of colored boys<br />playing ball now.
532991 534367 Baseball and football.
534451 537495 You right about that, Ro.<br />Times have changed, Troy.
537579 538913 You just come along too early.
538997 542667 There ought not never have been<br />no time called "too early."
544210 546421 Now you take that fellow...
546504 549215 What's that fellow they had playing<br />right field back then for the Yankees?
549299 550341 You remember<br />who I'm talking about, Bono,
550425 551384 played right field for The Yankees.
551468 553136 - Selkirk?<br />- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!
553219 556556 Man's batting 269, you understand?<br />269!
556639 560351 What sense that make?<br />I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!
560435 563438 He's batting 269,<br />playing right field for the Yankees!
563521 565648 I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.
565732 568401 She's running around<br />with raggedy shoes on her feet.
568485 570028 I bet you<br />Selkirk's daughter ain't running around
570111 571905 with no raggedy shoes on her feet.<br />I bet you that.
571988 573823 They got a lot of<br />colored baseball players now.
573907 575075 Jackie Robinson was the first.
575158 576618 Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.
576701 579913 I done seen 100 niggers play baseball<br />better than Jackie Robinson.
579996 582916 Hell, I seen some teams<br />Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!
582999 584292 What you talking about,<br />Jackie Robinson?
584375 586044 Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!
586127 587504 I'm talking about if you could play ball,
587587 588922 then they ought to let you play.
589005 590215 Don't matter what color you are.
590298 591925 Telling me I come along too early.
592008 595261 If you can play,<br />then they ought to let you play.
595345 599182 You gonna drink yourself to death.<br />You don't need to be drinking like that.
600183 601768 Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,
601851 604145 I done wrestled with him.<br />You can't tell me nothing about death.
604229 607524 Death ain't nothing<br />but a fastball on the outside corner,
607607 611444 and you know what I do with that.<br />Look here, Bono, am I lying?
611528 614364 You get one of them fastballs<br />about waist high
614447 616032 on the outside corner of the plate
616116 617826 where you can get<br />the meat of the bat on it,
617909 621162 and, good God,<br />you could kiss it good-bye.
621246 623206 - Am I lying?<br />- No, you telling the truth.
623373 624791 I seen you do it.
624874 630004 If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth<br />of lying. That's all death is to me.
630088 632507 A fastball on the outside corner.
632590 634926 I don't know why you want to<br />get on talking about death?
635009 636302 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with talking about death.
636386 638138 That's a part of life!<br />Everybody gonna die.
638221 639514 You gonna die. I'm gonna die.
639597 641391 Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.
641474 643852 But you ain't got to talk about it.<br />I don't like talking about it.
643935 645103 Well, you the one brought it up.
645186 646771 Me and Bono talking about baseball.
646855 648815 You come telling me<br />I'm gonna drink myself to death.
648898 650150 Ain't that right, Bono?
650233 652485 Now you know I drink just<br />but one night out the week,
652569 653736 that's Friday night.
653820 655530 I drink just enough to where<br />I can handle it.
655613 657115 Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.
657198 659242 So, you ain't got to worry<br />about me drinking myself to death
659367 660910 'cause I ain't worrying about death.
660994 663663 I done seen him,<br />done wrestled with him.
663746 665039 Look here, Bono.
665123 668293 I look up one day,<br />and Death is marching straight at me,
668376 670461 like soldiers on parade.
670545 672922 The Army of Death<br />was marching straight at me.
673006 676342 It was the middle of July, 1941.
676426 678678 And it got real cold,<br />just like it be winter.
678761 680346 And it seemed like Death, himself,
680430 682473 reached out<br />and touched me on the shoulder.
682557 685852 He touched me like I touch you now.<br />I got cold as ice.
685935 687187 Death standing there, grinning at me.
687270 688980 Troy, why don't you hush that talk.
689063 692358 I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?<br />You be wanting me?
692442 694319 "You done sent your army<br />to be getting me?"
694402 695361 I looked him dead in the eye.
695445 696529 I wasn't fearing nothing.
696613 699282 I was ready to tangle,<br />just like I'm ready to tangle now!
699657 701534 Bible says be ever vigilant.
701618 703912 So, I don't get but so drunk.<br />I got to keep watch.
703995 705580 Troy was right down there<br />at Mercy Hospital.
705663 707040 You remember he had that pneumonia,
707123 709042 laying there with a fever,<br />talking plumb out his head.
709125 710418 And Death standing there,<br />staring at me,
710501 711920 carrying that sickle in his hand.
712003 717759 Finally, he say, "You want to be<br />bound over for another year?"
717842 720011 Just like that. He say,
720094 723890 "You want to be bound over<br />for another year?"
723973 727977 I said, "Bound over, hell!<br />We can settle this right now."
728061 731481 He kinda fell back when I said that.<br />And all the cold went out of me.
731564 733566 I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.
733775 735443 I threw it as far as I could throw it,
735526 737195 and me and him<br />commenced to wrestling.
737278 740782 We wrestled for... Carry the six...<br />Three days and three nights!
740865 743201 Now, I don't know<br />where I got the strength from,
743284 744994 'cause every time<br />he tried to get the best of me,
745078 749207 I reached way deep down inside myself,<br />found the strength to do him one better.
749290 750875 Every time Troy tells that story,
750959 752210 he find different ways to tell it,
752293 753753 different things to make up.
753836 755255 I ain't making up nothing, woman.
755338 756881 I'm telling you<br />the facts of what happened.
756965 759259 I wrestled with Death<br />for three days and three nights,
759342 761803 and I'm standing here<br />to tell you about it.
764138 766140 All right. At the end of the third night,
766224 769310 we done weakened each other<br />to where we can't even hardly move.
769394 770395 Death stood up.
770478 772689 He threw on that robe,<br />had a white robe with a hood on it.
772814 776067 He throwed on that robe<br />and went off to look for that sickle.
776150 779821 He said, "I'll be back."<br />Just like that. "I'll be back."
779904 783032 I said, "Yeah?<br />Well, you gonna have to find me!"
783116 784242 I wasn't no fool.
784701 786119 I wasn't going looking for him.
786202 788746 I know Death ain't nothing to play with.<br />And I know he's gonna get me.
788830 791874 I know I got to join his army,<br />his camp followers.
791958 794836 But as long as I keep up my strength<br />and see him coming,
794919 798798 as long as I keep up my vigilance,<br />he gonna have to fight to get me.
798881 800174 I ain't going easy.
800550 804220 Well, look here,<br />since you got to keep up your vigilance,
804304 805763 let me have the bottle.
805847 807765 Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.
807849 808975 I should have left out that part.
809058 810518 Troy be talking all that stuff.
810601 812979 Half the time, he don't even know<br />what he be talking about!
813062 815023 - Yeah, Bono know me better than that.<br />- That's right, I know you.
815106 818318 I know you got some<br />Uncle Remus in your blood.
818401 820695 You got more stories<br />than the devil got sinners.
820778 823364 Hell, I done seen him, too.<br />Done talked to the devil.
823448 825074 Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!
827952 829162 Hey, Pop.
829245 830747 What you come "Hey, Poppin" ' me for?

837378 838796 He must've been doing all right.
838880 840048 I ain't seen him around here last week.
840131 841758 Troy, leave your boy alone.<br />He come by to see you
841841 843343 and you want to start all that nonsense.
843426 844761 I ain't bothering Lyons.<br />Here, get you a drink.
844844 846304 Me and him got an understanding.
846387 849557 I know why he come by to see me,<br />and he know I know.

854854 856064 I got some chicken cooking in the oven.
856147 857940 No, Rose, thanks.<br />I just was in the neighborhood
858024 859442 and thought I'd stop by for a minute.
859525 860985 Yeah, you was<br />in the neighborhood all right.
861069 862362 Nigger, you telling the truth there.
862445 864197 You was in the neighborhood<br />'cause it's my payday.
864280 866532 Well, hell, since you mentioned it,<br />let me have $10.
867241 870370 I'll be damned. I'll die and go to hell
870453 872914 and play blackjack with the devil<br />before I give you $10.
872997 875875 That's what I want to know about,<br />that devil you done seen.
875958 878127 Pop done seen the devil?<br />You too much, Pop.
878211 880421 - Yeah, I done seen him.<br />- He ain't seen no devil.
880505 882632 I told him that man<br />ain't had nothing to do with the devil.
882715 884801 Anything he can't understand,<br />he want to call it the devil.
884884 888096 Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's<br />to get some furniture.
888179 890973 You got three rooms for $298.<br />That what it say on the radio.
891057 894394 "Three rooms, $298."<br />He made up a little song about it.
894477 897480 I get down there,<br />man tell me I can't get no credit.
897563 899816 I'm working every day,<br />can't get no credit.
899899 900983 What to do?
901109 902819 I got an empty house<br />with some raggedy furniture.
902902 904028 Cory ain't got no bed.
904112 906239 He's sleeping on a pile of rags<br />on the floor.
906322 908366 Working every day, can't get no credit.
908449 909826 I come back here, Rose'll tell you,
909909 911786 madder than hell,<br />trying to figure out what to do.
912120 913246 Come a knock on the door.
913329 915373 I ain't been living but three days,<br />who know I'm here?
915498 917583 I open the door. Devil standing there.
917667 918709 Bigger than life.
918793 920670 White fella,<br />got on good clothes and everything.
920753 921921 Standing there<br />with a clipboard in his hand.
922004 923297 Now, I ain't got to say nothing.
923381 924841 First words come out of his mouth,
924924 927760 "I understand you need some furniture<br />and can't get no credit."
927844 931305 I liked to fell over. He said,<br />"I'll give you all the credit you want,
931389 933391 "but you gonna have to pay<br />the interest on it."
933474 934934 Now, I told him,<br />he give me them three rooms,
935017 936477 he can charge whatever he want.
936561 938187 Next day, a truck pull up here,
938271 939939 two men unload them three rooms.
940022 942233 Man what drove the truck<br />give me a book.
942316 945778 Said first of the month,<br />send $10 to the address in the book,
945862 946946 everything'll be fine.
947029 948531 Said if you miss a payment,
948614 951284 the devil was coming back,<br />and there'll be hell to pay.
951367 952869 That was 15 years ago.
952952 956497 To this day, first day of every month,<br />I send my $10,
956581 957957 just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.
958040 960877 - Troy lying.<br />- I ain't never seen that man since.
960960 962837 Now, you tell me,<br />who else that gonna be but the devil?
962920 965006 And I ain't sold my soul<br />or nothing like that.
965089 967800 No, I wouldn't have truck with the devil<br />over nothing like that.
967884 971471 But I got my furniture.<br />And I send my $10, just like clockwork.
971554 974432 How long you say<br />you been paying this $10 a month?
974515 975558 15 years.
975641 979312 Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?<br />How much the man done charge you?
979395 982648 Hell, I done paid for it.<br />I done paid for it 10 times over.
982732 983983 Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.
984066 986527 Troy lying.<br />We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.
986611 988321 He ain't paying no $10 a month<br />to nobody.
988404 990698 Hell, woman,<br />Bono know I ain't that big a fool.
990781 993326 I was just getting ready to say,<br />I know where there's a bridge for sale.
993409 994494 I'll tell you this.
994577 996329 It don't matter to me if it was the devil.
996412 997747 It don't matter if the devil give credit.
997830 999749 - Somebody got to give it.<br />- It ought to matter.
999832 1002126 You walking around here saying<br />you gonna make truck with the devil,
1002210 1003628 God's the one<br />you're gonna have to answer to.
1003711 1005254 He's the one gonna be at the Judgment.
1005338 1007256 Yeah, well, look here, Pop,<br />let me have that $10.
1007340 1008466 I'll give it back to you.
1008549 1010009 Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.
1010092 1011177 Bono, what did I tell you?
1011260 1012845 Only time I see this nigger<br />is when he want something.
1012929 1014096 That's the only time I see him.
1014305 1016724 Come on, Pop,<br />Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.
1016807 1019018 Let me have the $10.<br />I told you, Bonnie's working!
1019143 1020436 What that mean to me<br />if Bonnie's working?
1020520 1023689 I don't care if she working.<br />Go ask her for $10 if she's working.
1023773 1026442 Talking about Bonnie working.<br />Why ain't you working?

1035326 1038120 I told you that last time you<br />come back here asking for something.
1038204 1039497 No, Pop, thanks, that ain't for me.
1039580 1041082 I don't want to be carrying<br />nobody's rubbish.
1041165 1043000 I don't want to be punching<br />nobody's time clock.
1043084 1045086 What's the matter?<br />You too good to carry people's rubbish?
1045169 1047046 Where you think that $10<br />you talking about comes from?
1047129 1048881 I'm just supposed to<br />haul people's rubbish
1048965 1050841 and give my money to you<br />'cause you too lazy to work?
1050925 1052051 You're too lazy to work
1052134 1053719 and want to know<br />why you ain't got what I got.

1059267 1060643 I got to eat beans the rest of the week?
1060726 1062103 No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.
1062228 1063729 You ain't got to be eating no beans.
1063813 1065064 I don't know why you want to say that?
1065147 1066983 I ain't got no extra money!
1068859 1070027 Gabe done moved out,
1070111 1072488 giving his money over there<br />to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.
1072572 1073739 Things done got tight around here.
1073823 1075324 I can't afford to be<br />giving you every payday.
1075408 1078035 I ain't asked you to give me nothing.<br />I asked you to loan me $10.
1078119 1079203 I know you got $10.
1079287 1081414 Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?
1081497 1083749 'Cause I don't throw my money away<br />on them streets.

1085960 1087587 running around in them<br />clubs and things,

1100433 1101601 Life don't owe you nothing.
1101684 1104270 You owe it to yourself.<br />Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.
1104353 1106814 You got your way of<br />dealing with the world, I got mine.
1106897 1108691 Only thing that matters to me<br />is the music.

1122204 1123372 I just stay with my music
1123456 1125583 'cause that's the only way<br />I can find to live in the world.
1125666 1128294 Otherwise, ain't no telling<br />what I might do.

1138095 1140765 You can't change me, Pop.<br />I'm 34 years old.
1141557 1142767 If you wanted to change me,
1142850 1144602 you should have been there<br />when I was growing up.
1145061 1147480 I come by to see you, ask you for $10,
1147563 1150316 and you want to talk about<br />how I was raised?

1169210 1171045 You know what I do with my money.

1197947 1200116 Wait a minute.<br />You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose,"
1200199 1202034 but you ain't gonna look to see<br />where she got that money from.
1202118 1204245 - You see how they do me, Bono?<br />- I know she got it from you, Pop.
1204328 1206664 - Thanks. I'll give it back to you.<br />- There you go, telling another lie.
1206747 1208999 Time I see that $10,<br />you'll be owing me $30 more.
1209083 1210960 - See you, Mr. Bono.<br />- Take care, Lyons.

1218634 1219927 and take care of that woman he got.
1220010 1222513 He'll be all right, Troy.<br />The boy is still young!
1222763 1226225 - The boy is 34 years old.<br />- Let's not get off into all that.
1226308 1229478 Look here, I got to go. I got to be going.<br />Lucille gonna be waiting.
1229562 1233649 See this woman, Bono?<br />I love this woman.
1234233 1237153 I love her so much, it hurts.
1237236 1241282 I love her so much,<br />I done run out of ways of loving her,
1241365 1243617 so, I got to get back to basics.
1243826 1245453 Don't you come by my house<br />Monday morning,
1245536 1246662 talking about time to go to work.
1246746 1248914 - 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.<br />- Troy, stop!
1248998 1252334 I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.<br />That ain't nothing but gin talk.

1258507 1260676 I done told you what I'm gonna be doing!
1263095 1265181 Come back on Tuesday!
1291290 1294543 <i>Jesus be a fence</i>
1295127 1297379 <i>All around me</i>
1297463 1299298 <i>Every day</i>
1304887 1306764 Good morning.
1306847 1308808 You ready for breakfast?<br />I can fix you some
1308891 1311143 soon as I finish hanging up<br />these clothes.
1311227 1315815 I got the coffee on. That's all right.<br />I just have some of that this morning.
1317858 1320319 That 651 hit yesterday.
1320402 1323239 That's the second time this month<br />Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.
1323322 1325658 Seems like those that need the least<br />always get lucky.
1325741 1326909 Poor folks can't get nothing.
1326992 1328327 Them numbers don't know nobody.
1328410 1330579 I don't know why you fool with 'em,<br />you and Lyons both.
1330663 1332164 It's something to do.
1332248 1334500 You ain't doing nothing<br />but throwing your money away.
1334583 1336168 Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.
1336252 1337837 I just play a nickel here<br />and a nickel there.
1337920 1339421 That's two nickels you done<br />throwed away.
1339505 1342174 Nah, I hit sometimes.<br />That makes up for it.
1342258 1343759 Always comes in handy when I do hit.
1343843 1345010 I don't hear you complaining then.
1345094 1346971 I ain't complaining now.<br />I just say it's foolish,
1347054 1350182 trying to guess out of 600 ways<br />which way the number gonna come.
1350266 1351851 If I had all the money these niggers...
1355521 1359441 You negroes throw away<br />on numbers in one week,
1359525 1362361 just one week, I'd be a rich man.
1362444 1363904 You wishing and calling it foolish
1363988 1365614 ain't gonna stop folks<br />from playing the numbers.
1365698 1367700 That's one thing for sure.
1367783 1370953 Besides, some good things<br />come from playing numbers.
1371036 1373998 Look where Pope done bought him<br />that restaurant off of numbers.
1374081 1378711 I can't stand niggers like that.<br />Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.
1378794 1381505 He running around with his shoes<br />all run-over,
1381589 1383591 bumming money for cigarettes.
1383674 1386594 All right.<br />Got lucky there, hit the numbers...
1386677 1388053 Troy, I know all about it.
1388137 1390890 Had good sense. I'll say that for him.<br />Man ain't throw his money away.
1390973 1394810 I done see niggers go through<br />$2,000 in four days.
1394894 1397396 Man built him that restaurant<br />down there.
1397479 1398981 Fix it up real nice, too.
1399064 1400941 Then he won't let nobody come in it.
1401025 1403360 Negro go in there,<br />can't get no kind of service.
1403444 1406739 Seen a white fella go in there,<br />he orders a bowl of stew.
1406822 1409074 Pope pick all the meat<br />out of the pot for him.
1409158 1411118 Man ain't had nothing<br />but a bowl of meat!
1411201 1412661 Negro go in there behind him,
1412745 1414705 he ain't got nothing<br />but the potatoes and the carrots.
1414788 1416916 Talking about<br />what numbers do for people.
1416999 1418250 You picked the wrong example there.
1418334 1420419 Ain't done nothing<br />but made a worser fool out of him
1420502 1422296 than he already was before.
1423964 1425424 Troy.
1425507 1428761 You ought to stop worrying about<br />what happened at work yesterday.
1431055 1432348 I ain't worried.
1433933 1436018 Just called me down there,<br />the Commissioner's office,
1436101 1438771 everybody's worried<br />about them firing me.
1438854 1441732 I ain't worrying about them firing me.
1441815 1444026 You ain't got to worry about that.
1444109 1446278 Where's Cory? Cory in the house?
1449698 1451825 - Cory!<br />- He gone out.
1451909 1453661 Out? Yeah, he going out
1453744 1456622 'cause he know<br />I want him to work on this fence.
1456705 1458624 I know how he is.<br />That boy is scared of working.
1458707 1460000 He ain't done a lick of work in his life.
1460084 1461543 He had to go to football practice.
1461627 1463629 Coach wanted them<br />to get in a little extra practice
1463712 1465005 before the season start.
1465089 1466757 Yeah, I got his practice all right.
1466840 1469134 Running out of here<br />before he gets his chores done.
1469218 1470803 Troy, what is wrong with you<br />this morning?
1470886 1472012 Don't nothing set right with you.
1472096 1474431 Go on back in there, go to bed,<br />and get up on the other side.
1474515 1475808 Why something got to be<br />wrong with me?
1475891 1476976 I ain't said nothing wrong with me.
1477059 1478519 Well, you got something to say<br />about everything.
1478602 1480354 First, it's the numbers,<br />then it's the way the man
1480437 1482272 run his restaurant,<br />then you done got on Cory.
1482356 1483899 What's it gonna be next?
1483983 1486151 Take a look up there,<br />see if the weather suit you.
1486235 1487736 Or is it gonna be<br />how you gonna put up this fence
1487820 1489113 with the clothes hanging in the yard?
1489196 1490781 You hit the nail on the head then.

1581872 1582956 You ain't done nothing to me.
1583040 1587461 I just move over to Miss Pearl's<br />to keep out from in your way.
1587544 1588796 I ain't mean no harm by it.

1617616 1619451 That's my key for my two rooms.
1619535 1621495 That's good, Gabe.<br />Got your own key, that's good.
1621578 1622746 You hungry, Gabe?
1622830 1624498 I was just fixing to cook Troy<br />some breakfast.
1624581 1627251 I'll take some biscuits.<br />You got some biscuits?
1629211 1633090 Did you know, when I was in Heaven,<br />every morning, me and Saint Peter
1633173 1637010 would sit down by the Gate<br />and eat some big, fat biscuits?
1637094 1641473 Yeah, we had us a good time.<br />We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.
1641557 1644143 And then Saint Peter<br />would go off to sleep,
1644226 1645853 and tell me to wake him up
1645936 1648188 when it's time to open the Gates<br />for the Judgment.
1648272 1652776 Well, come on,<br />I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.
1652860 1656780 Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name<br />in his book. I seen it.

1659032 1660909 I say, "I know him.
1660993 1664329 "He got the same name like what I got.
1664413 1666373 "That's my brother."
1667749 1670085 How many times<br />you gonna tell me that, Gabe?
1670169 1673213 Ain't got my name in the book.<br />Don't have to have my name.
1673297 1675507 I done died and went to Heaven.
1675591 1678594 But he got your name, though.
1678677 1682014 One morning,<br />Saint Peter was looking at his book,
1682097 1684766 and he was marking it up<br />for the Judgment,
1684850 1686894 and he let me see your name.
1686977 1691857 He got it in there under "M."<br />He got Rose's name.
1691940 1695277 I ain't seen it like I seen yours,<br />but I know it's in there.
1695611 1698947 He got a great big book!
1699031 1701700 He got everybody's name<br />what was ever been born.
1701783 1703076 That's what he told me.
1703785 1706997 But I seen your name.<br />I seen it with my own eye.

1733482 1735484 I'm gonna save 'em<br />and buy me a new horn,
1735567 1740322 so Saint Peter can hear me<br />when it's time to open the Gate.
1740489 1741907 You hear that?
1744326 1747037 You hear that? That's the hellhound.
1747120 1748789 I'm gonna chase them out of here.
1748872 1752709 Go on! Get out of here! Get out!<br />Get out!
1755963 1758090 <i>All you hypocrite members</i>

1812811 1814730 He's gone off somewhere.
1817357 1818483 He ain't eating right.
1818567 1820527 Miss Pearl say<br />she can't get him to eat nothing.
1820610 1821862 What you want me to do about it, Rose?
1821945 1825407 I did everything I could for the man.<br />I can't make him get well.
1825490 1828660 Man got half his head blown off,<br />what you expect?
1828744 1830454 Seems like something ought to be done<br />to help him.
1830537 1831830 The man don't bother nobody.
1831913 1834291 He just mixed up<br />'cause of that metal plate
1834374 1837044 he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...
1837127 1840172 Thank you. Ain't no sense<br />in sending him to the hospital.
1840255 1841548 At least he'd be eating right.
1841631 1843050 They could help him<br />take care of himself.
1843133 1844718 Don't nobody<br />want to be locked up, Rose.
1844801 1846678 What you want to lock the man up for?
1846762 1848388 Man going down there,
1848472 1852684 over there and fight that war,<br />messing with them Japs,
1852768 1854436 getting half his head blown off.
1854519 1858231 They give him a lousy $3,000.<br />I got to swoop down on that.
1858315 1859649 Is you fixing to get into that again?
1859733 1861777 He got a metal plate in his head.
1861860 1863904 That's the only reason<br />I got a roof over my head
1863987 1865530 is 'cause of that metal plate.
1865614 1867449 Ain't no sense in you<br />blaming yourself for nothing.
1867532 1869701 Gabe was in no condition<br />to manage that money.
1869785 1870911 You done what was right by him.
1870994 1873038 Can't nobody say<br />you ain't done what was right by him.
1873121 1874498 Look how long you took care of him.
1874581 1877209 Till he wanted his own place<br />and moved over there with Miss Pearl.
1877292 1879795 That ain't what I'm saying, woman.<br />I'm just...
1882381 1883840 I'm just stating the facts.
1883924 1886009 If my brother<br />didn't have a metal plate in his head,
1886093 1887511 I wouldn't have a pot to piss in
1887594 1889012 or a window to throw it out of.
1889096 1890806 And I'm 53...
1900816 1902359 Where you going off to?
1902442 1904111 You been running out of here<br />every Saturday for weeks.
1904194 1907030 I thought you were gonna<br />work on this fence.
1907114 1909366 I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and...
1958874 1959875 Mama?
1961543 1964129 Cory. Your daddy<br />like to have a fit with you
1964212 1967090 running out of here this morning<br />without doing your chores.
1967174 1968425 You all right?
1968508 1971803 He say you supposed to be<br />helping him with the fence.
1971887 1973263 I told you I had to go to practice.
1973346 1975348 And he's been saying that<br />the last four or five Saturdays,
1975432 1978518 and then don't ever do nothing<br />but go down to Taylors'.
1979978 1982022 - You told him about the recruiter?<br />- Yeah, I told him.
1982105 1984774 - Well, what'd he say?<br />- He didn't say nothing too much.
1984858 1987486 Go on and get started on your chores<br />before he gets back here.
1987569 1990197 Go on and scrub down them steps
1990280 1993158 before he come back here hollering<br />and carrying on!
1993241 1995076 Go! Boy, go!

2021102 2022270 What was the score of the game?
2022354 2024189 Lucille had me on the phone.<br />I couldn't keep up with it.
2024272 2025815 What do I care about the game?<br />Come here, woman.
2025899 2027025 I thought you went down to Taylors'
2027108 2028860 to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.
2028944 2030695 I thought you're supposed to<br />be putting up the fence.
2030779 2033114 I'll put it up when I finish with what...
2034449 2035575 Is at hand.
2035659 2037702 Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!
2037786 2040705 I'm studying you.<br />I'm finna do my homework.

2098471 2100140 That garbage<br />sitting in there, overflowing.
2100223 2101516 You ain't done none of your chores.
2101600 2102809 Now you come in here,<br />talking about, "Yeah."
2102892 2104311 I was just getting ready<br />to do my chores now, Pop.
2104394 2106646 Your first chore is to help me<br />with this fence on Saturday.
2106730 2108273 Everything else come after that.
2108356 2110692 Now, get that saw,<br />we gonna cut these boards.
2114321 2117782 Hey, Pop. Why don't you buy a TV?
2117866 2120327 What I want with a TV?<br />What I want one of them for?
2120410 2123204 Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.
2123663 2125498 I ain't asked who had one,<br />I said what I want with one?
2125582 2128043 So, you can watch it.<br />They got lots of things on TV.
2128126 2129377 - Baseball and everything.<br />- Yeah?
2129461 2130754 We could watch the World Series.
2130837 2132797 - Yeah, how much this TV cost?<br />- I don't know.
2132881 2135467 They got 'em on sale for about $200.
2135550 2137218 - $200?<br />- That ain't that much, Pop.
2137552 2139888 No, that's just $200.
2141014 2143099 You see that roof you got<br />sitting over your head at night?
2143350 2145268 Let me tell you something<br />about that roof.
2145352 2149230 It's been 10 years<br />since that roof was last tarred.
2149314 2152442 See, now snow come this winter,<br />sit up on that roof like it is,
2152525 2154486 it's gonna seep inside,<br />just gonna be a little bit,
2154569 2155695 you ain't gonna hardly notice it,
2155779 2156863 then next thing you know,
2156946 2158448 it's gonna be leaking all over the house.
2158531 2162494 Then the wood rot from all that water,<br />and you gonna need a whole new roof.
2162577 2164746 Now how much you think it cost<br />to get that roof fixed?
2165121 2169084 - I don't know.<br />- $264 cash money. See?
2169167 2170877 While you be thinking about a TV,
2170960 2175131 I got to be thinking about the roof<br />or whatever else go wrong around here.
2175215 2177133 Now if you had $200,<br />what would you do?
2177217 2179594 Fix the roof, or buy a TV?
2179678 2182097 I'd buy a TV.<br />And when the roof started to leak,
2182180 2183473 if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.
2183556 2184933 Where you gonna get your money from?
2185016 2186309 You done spent it on a TV.
2186393 2189813 You gonna sit up in there, let that<br />water run all over your brand-new TV?
2189896 2191439 Pop, you got the money. I know you do.
2191523 2193233 - Where I got it at?<br />- In the bank.
2193316 2194609 You want to see my bank book?
2194693 2197487 You want to see that $73.22<br />I got sitting up in there?
2197570 2199239 You don't have to pay for it<br />all at one time.
2199322 2201199 You can put a down payment on it,<br />and carry it on with you.
2201282 2203952 Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing<br />if I can help it.
2204035 2206579 Miss a payment, they come<br />and snatch it right out of your house.
2206663 2209708 Then what you got? See?
2209791 2213336 Now, when I get $200 clear,<br />I'll buy me a TV.
2213420 2216798 Right now, when I get $264,<br />I'm gonna get that roof fixed.
2216881 2217882 Pop...
2217966 2220677 You go get you $200<br />and buy you a TV if you want to.
2220760 2222345 I got better things to do with my money.
2222429 2224681 I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.
2225098 2226307 All right, I'll tell you what.
2226391 2229602 You get $100,<br />I'll put the other $100 with it.
2229686 2231146 All right, I'm gonna show you.
2231229 2234482 Yeah, show me how you can<br />cut these boards right now.
2235191 2237652 There you go. That's $200 worth.
2240405 2242157 - The Pirates won today.<br />- Yeah?
2242240 2243366 That makes five in a row.
2243450 2245869 I ain't thinking about no Pirates.<br />They got an all-white team.
2245952 2249622 Got that boy, though,<br />that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?
2249956 2251040 Don't even half play him.
2251124 2253126 That boy could be something<br />if they'd give him a chance.
2253376 2255253 Play him one day,<br />sit him on the bench the next.
2255336 2256546 He gets lots of chances to play.
2256629 2258548 I'm talking about playing every day,<br />playing regular,
2258631 2260216 so you can get your timing,<br />that's what I'm talking about.
2260300 2262385 They got some white guys on the team<br />that don't play every day.
2262469 2263720 You can't play everybody<br />at the same time.
2263803 2265597 If they got a white fellow<br />sitting on the bench,
2265680 2268308 you can bet your last dollar<br />he can't play.
2268391 2270435 Colored guy got to be twice as good<br />to get on the team.
2270518 2273313 That's why I don't want you<br />getting all tied up in them sports.
2273396 2275440 Man on the team, what it get him?
2275523 2277484 Got colored on the team,<br />don't even use him.
2277567 2280320 Same as not having them.<br />All them teams the same.
2280403 2282697 The Braves got Hank Aaron<br />and Wes Covington.
2282781 2284783 Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.<br />That makes 43.
2284866 2286826 Aaron ain't nobody.<br />That's what you supposed to do.
2286910 2288703 That's how the game's supposed<br />to be played.
2288787 2291539 Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of<br />getting your timing and follow through.
2291623 2293750 Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.
2293833 2295335 Not off no major-league pitcher,<br />you couldn't.
2295418 2296961 We had better pitching<br />in the Negro leagues.
2297045 2298797 I hit seven home runs<br />off of Satchel Paige.
2298880 2300131 You can't get no better than that.
2300215 2301883 Sandy Koufax,<br />he leading the league in strikeouts.
2301966 2303468 I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.
2303551 2305303 You got Warren Spahn<br />and Lew Burdette. I bet you...
2305386 2306638 I'm through with it now.
2310892 2313269 Go and cut them boards.
2315396 2318691 Your mama told me you got<br />recruited by a college football team.
2318775 2320068 Is that right?
2320276 2323530 Yeah, Coach Zellman say the recruiter<br />gonna be coming by to talk to you.
2323613 2325657 Get you to sign the permission papers.
2325740 2327325 I thought you was supposed to<br />be working down the A&P.
2327408 2329035 Ain't you supposed to be<br />working down there after school?
2329118 2330870 Mr. Stawicki say<br />he gonna hold my job for me
2330954 2332372 until after the football season.
2332622 2335041 He said starting next week,<br />I can work weekends.
2335124 2338044 Boy, I thought we had an understanding<br />about this football stuff.

2347220 2349264 - I'm gonna be working weekends.<br />- You damn right you are!
2349347 2351182 And ain't no need for nobody<br />to be coming around here,
2351266 2352433 talking to me about signing nothing.
2352517 2353560 Pop, you can't do that.
2353643 2354936 He's coming all the way<br />from North Carolina.
2355019 2356896 I don't care where he coming from!
2356980 2358147 Look, boy,
2359274 2360692 the white man ain't gonna let you
2360775 2362569 get nowhere with no football no way.
2362944 2365154 Now you get your book-learning,<br />so you can
2365280 2368199 work your way up at the A&P<br />and learn how to fix cars,
2368283 2369951 or build houses, get you a trade.
2370034 2372579 This way, you got something<br />can't nobody take away from you.
2372662 2375081 You go in and learn how to<br />put your hands to good use
2375164 2377041 besides hauling other people's garbage.

2378293 2379627 That's why the recruiter<br />want to talk with you.
2379711 2381296 You got to keep up<br />your grades to get recruited.
2381379 2383214 This way, I'll be going to college,<br />I'll get a chance.
2383298 2386759 First, you get your butt down there<br />and get your job back.
2386843 2388261 Mr. Stawicki done already<br />hired somebody else
2388344 2389804 'cause I told him I was playing football.
2391431 2393266 You a bigger fool than I thought.
2393349 2395351 You gonna let somebody<br />take away your job,
2395435 2396769 so you can play some football.
2397312 2398563 Where you gonna get your money
2398646 2400106 to take care of your girlfriend<br />and whatnot?
2400189 2401566 What kind of foolishness is that
2401649 2403067 to let somebody take away your job?
2403151 2404402 I'm still gonna be working weekends.
2404485 2406571 No. You getting out of here<br />and finding you another job.

2409824 2411409 The team needs me,<br />that's what Coach Zellman say.
2411492 2413620 I don't care what nobody say.<br />I'm the boss. You understand?
2413703 2416956 I'm the boss around here.<br />I do the only saying what counts.
2417040 2419459 - Come on...<br />- I asked you, "Do you understand?"

2422503 2425673 - Yes, sir.<br />- All right.
2425757 2427550 You get on down there to that A&P
2427634 2428801 and see if you can get your job back.
2428885 2431429 If you can't do both,<br />then you quit the football team.
2431512 2433640 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.
2433723 2434933 Yes, sir.
2442523 2445610 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- What the hell you got to ask me?
2445693 2448488 Mr. Stawicki the one<br />you got the questions for.
2448571 2450031 How come you ain't never liked me?
2451240 2455495 Like you?<br />Who the hell said I got to like you?

2498454 2500373 "Like" you.
2500456 2502333 I go out of here every morning,
2502417 2505712 I bust my butt putting up<br />with them crackers every day
2505795 2507505 'cause I "like" you.
2507588 2510633 You about the biggest fool I ever saw.<br />It's my job.
2510717 2512552 It's my responsibility.
2512635 2515430 A man is supposed to<br />take care of his family.
2515638 2518516 You live in my house,<br />fill your belly with my food,
2518599 2522186 put your behind on my bed<br />because you're my son.
2522270 2525064 Not 'cause I like you.<br />'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.
2525148 2527734 I owe a responsibility to you.
2527817 2529694 Now, let's get this straight<br />right here and now,
2529777 2531320 before it go along any further.
2531404 2532864 I ain't got to like you.
2532947 2536075 Mr. Rand don't give me my money<br />come payday 'cause he like me.
2536159 2539203 He give it to me 'cause he owe me.
2539662 2541330 Now I done give you everything<br />I got to give you.
2541414 2543708 I give you your life!
2543791 2545293 Me and your mama<br />worked that out between us,
2545376 2548463 and liking your black ass<br />wasn't part of the bargain.
2548671 2550089 Now don't you go through life
2550173 2552383 worrying about<br />whether somebody like you, or not.
2552467 2555553 You best be making sure<br />they're doing right by you.
2555636 2557263 - You understand what I'm saying?<br />- Yes, sir.
2557346 2560808 Then get the hell out of my face<br />and get on down to that A&P!
2584165 2586584 Why don't you go ahead<br />and let the boy play football, Troy?
2586667 2588586 He just want to be like you<br />with the sports.
2588669 2590755 I don't want him to be like me.
2590838 2592423 I want him to get as far away<br />from my life
2592507 2593591 as he possibly can get.
2593674 2595843 You the only decent thing<br />ever happened to me, Rose.
2596344 2597804 And I wish him that.
2598346 2601516 But I don't wish him<br />nothing else from my life.
2602517 2606437 I decided 17 years ago, that boy<br />wasn't gonna get involved in no sports.
2606521 2608147 Not after<br />what they did to me in the sports.
2608231 2610483 Why don't you just admit<br />you were too old for the major leagues?
2610566 2612151 For once, why don't you just admit that?
2612235 2613903 Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.
2613986 2617240 I just wasn't the right color.<br />Hell, I'm 53 years old,
2617365 2620451 I can do better than Selkirk's .269<br />right now.
2620535 2622870 How were you gonna play ball<br />when you were over 40?
2622954 2624622 Sometimes, I can't get<br />no sense out of you.
2624705 2625790 I got good sense, woman.
2625873 2629127 I got sense enough not to let that boy<br />get hurt playing no sports.
2629210 2630711 You mothering the boy too much.
2630837 2632964 Worrying about whether people<br />"like" him or not.
2633047 2636300 Everything that boy do, he do for you.
2636384 2638970 He wants you to say, "Good job, son."<br />That's all.
2639387 2642515 I ain't got time for that, Rose.<br />He's alive, he's healthy.
2642598 2645977 He's got to make his own way.<br />I made mine.
2646060 2648604 Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand<br />when he get out there in the world.
2648688 2651023 Times have changed, Troy.
2651107 2653192 People change.
2653276 2655570 The world changing,<br />and you can't even see it.
2662076 2664829 Woman, I do the best I can do.
2664912 2666247 I come in here every Friday,
2666330 2669167 I carry a sack of potatoes<br />and a bucket of lard.
2669250 2672837 You all line up at the door<br />with your hands out.
2672920 2676507 I give you the lint from my pockets.<br />I give you my sweat and my blood.
2676591 2679218 I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.
2679302 2681929 We go upstairs in that room at night,<br />I fall down on you
2682013 2685516 and try to blast a hole into forever.
2685600 2687852 I get up Monday morning,<br />find my lunch on the table,
2687935 2689312 go out and make my way.
2689395 2693691 Find my strength<br />to get me through to next Friday.
2693774 2695151 That's all I got, Rose.
2698279 2701073 That's all I got to give.
2705286 2706787 Can't give nothing else!
2733731 2734982 Mr. Maxson?
2737902 2740112 Commissioner will see you now.
2746911 2748287 Rose!
2751249 2752833 Hey, Ro!
2752917 2757338 I wish I could've seen Mr. Rand's face<br />when he told you.
2757421 2760216 He couldn't get it out his mouth.<br />Liked to bit his tongue.
2760299 2762218 When they called me down there<br />to the Commissioner's office,
2762301 2765096 he thought they was gonna fire me,<br />like everybody else.
2765179 2766806 I didn't think they was gonna fire you.
2766889 2769350 I thought they's gonna put you<br />on the warning paper.
2769433 2772770 Hey, Rose!<br />Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.
2772853 2774897 I see you run right down there<br />to Taylors'
2774981 2776274 and told that Alberta gal.
2776357 2779443 Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!
2779527 2781445 I went down there to cash my check.
2782321 2783364 Hey!

2785324 2787118 What they say down<br />at the Commissioner's office?
2787201 2788995 You supposed to come<br />when I call you, woman.
2789078 2790246 Bono will tell you that.
2790329 2791831 Don't Lucille come when you call her?
2791914 2793040 Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

2799964 2802216 End up getting a stick chasin' him away,<br />trying to make him come.
2802300 2803801 I ain't studying you and your dog.
2803884 2805469 I remember you used to<br />sing that old song.
2805720 2807888 <i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>
2808097 2809765 <i>Had an old dog His name was Blue</i>
2809849 2811350 Nobody wants to hear that old song.
2812310 2814061 <i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>
2814145 2816230 Used to have Cory runnin' around here<br />singin' that song.
2816314 2817982 Hell, I remember that song myself.
2818065 2820443 <i>You know Blue Was a good old dog</i>
2820651 2822820 <i>Blue treed a possum<br />In a hollow log</i>
2822987 2825531 That's my daddy's song.<br />My daddy made up that song.
2825614 2828159 I don't care who made it up.<br />Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.
2828492 2829827 <i>Come here, woman!</i>
2830161 2833622 You come in here carrying on,<br />I reckon they ain't fired you.
2833706 2835666 What they say down there<br />at the Commissioner's office?
2835750 2838794 Look here, Rose.<br />Mr. Rand called me in his office
2838878 2841380 after I got back from<br />talkin' to them people down there.

2845509 2846927 They was making me a driver!
2847511 2850431 - Troy, you kidding!<br />- No, I ain't. Ask Bono.
2850514 2851640 That's great, Troy.<br />Now you don't have to
2851724 2853142 hassle them people no more.
2853225 2856354 Oh, hell.<br />I didn't think I was gonna see you today.
2856437 2857938 I thought you was in jail.

2864862 2866072 I don't go down there gambling.
2866155 2868032 I just go down there<br />to sit in with the band.
2868115 2870201 I ain't got nothing to do<br />with the gambling part.
2870284 2871786 They got some good music down there.
2871869 2873621 They got some rogues is what they got.
2873704 2875706 How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.
2875790 2878459 I see where you playing down<br />at the Crawford Grill tonight.
2878542 2880044 How come you ain't brought<br />Bonnie like I told you?
2880127 2881128 You shoulda brought Bonnie.
2881212 2882505 She ain't been by<br />in a month of Sundays.
2882588 2883798 I was just in the neighborhood.
2883881 2885299 - Thought I'd stop by.<br />- Here it comes.
2885383 2887593 Your daddy got a promotion<br />on the rubbish.
2887676 2890012 He gonna be the first colored driver.
2890096 2891347 Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there
2891430 2892890 and read the paper,<br />like them white fellas.
2892973 2895684 Hey, Pop, if you knew<br />how to read, you'd be all right.
2895768 2898270 Nah, nah. You mean<br />if the nigger knew how to drive,
2898354 2899480 he'd be all right.
2899730 2901273 Been fighting with them people<br />about driving
2901357 2903109 and ain't even got a license.
2903192 2904902 Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2904985 2905986 Driving ain't nothing.
2906070 2907822 All you do is point the truck<br />where you want it to go.
2907905 2908989 Driving ain't nothing.
2909073 2910616 Do they know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2910699 2911784 That's what I'm talkin' about.
2911867 2913244 I ain't asked if driving was easy.
2913327 2915663 I asked if Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license.
2915746 2916831 The man ain't got to know my business.
2916914 2919083 Time he find out, I have<br />two or three of them driver's license.
2919166 2921043 - Say, look here, Pop.<br />- I knew it was coming.
2921127 2923045 I knew what kinda "Look here, Pop"<br />that was.
2923129 2924422 Nigger finna ask me<br />for some money.
2924672 2926382 It's Friday night, it's my payday.
2926465 2930010 All them rogues down on the avenue,<br />the ones that ain't in jail,
2930094 2932805 and Lyons is hopping in his shoes<br />to get down there with them.
2932888 2933931 Now, see, Pop,
2934014 2936517 if you gave somebody else<br />a chance to talk sometime,
2936600 2940187 you'd see I was fixing to pay you back<br />your $10 like I told you.
2940271 2943441 Here. I told you I'd pay you<br />when Bonnie got paid.
2943524 2945734 No, you keep that $10.<br />Put it in the bank.
2945818 2947403 Next time you feel like<br />you wanna come by here
2947486 2949113 and ask me for somethin',<br />you go down there and get that.
2949447 2950698 Here you go your $10, Pop.
2950781 2952575 I told you,<br />I don't want you to give me nothing.
2952658 2953868 I just wanted to borrow $10.
2953951 2956537 No, you keep that for the next time<br />you want to ask me.
2956787 2958122 Come on, Pop, here go your $10.
2958205 2961292 Troy, why don't you let the boy<br />pay you back?
2964128 2966672 Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,
2966755 2968716 I'm gonna hear about it<br />for the next six months.
2968799 2970426 You can hand yours over, too, Troy.
2970509 2972052 You see this, Bono?<br />You see how they do me?
2972136 2973888 Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.
2974013 2977308 <i>Better get<br />Ready for the Judgment</i>
2978809 2980352 <i>Better get ready</i>
2983147 2985149 Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!
2985232 2986567 How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
2986650 2988110 Lyons!
2990070 2992448 The King of the Jungle!
2992823 2995701 Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.
2995784 2998245 I picked it myself.<br />That's the same rose like you is.
2998329 2999997 That's right nice of you, Gabe.
3000080 3001582 What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?
3001665 3005169 I been chasing hellhounds<br />and waiting for the time
3005252 3007087 to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.
3007171 3008839 You been chasing hellhounds, huh?
3008923 3010633 Well, you doing<br />the right thing, Uncle Gabe.
3010716 3013719 - Somebody's got to chase 'em.<br />- Yeah, I know it.
3013802 3016680 The devil's strong.<br />The devil ain't no pushover.
3016764 3019183 Hellhounds<br />snipping at everybody's heels.
3019266 3021894 But I got my trumpet waiting<br />on the Judgment time.
3021977 3023687 Waiting on<br />the Battle of Armageddon, huh?
3023771 3025856 Ain't gonna be too much of a battle
3025940 3029401 when God get to waving<br />that Judgment sword.
3029485 3031570 But the people's<br />gonna have a hell of a time
3031654 3034198 trying to get into Heaven<br />if them Gates ain't open.
3034281 3035783 You hear this, Pop?
3036367 3038577 - Uncle Gabe, you all right.<br />- Lyons.
3041664 3044124 - The King of the Jungle!<br />- You stayin' for supper, Gabe?
3044208 3045292 You want me to fix you a plate?
3045376 3048295 I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.<br />I don't want no plate.
3048379 3050464 I want to eat with my hands.<br />I'll take a sandwich.
3050548 3052967 What about you, Lyons? You stayin'?<br />Got some short ribs cooking.
3053050 3056512 Nah. I won't eat nothing<br />till after we finish playing.
3057179 3059139 You ought to come down,<br />listen to me play, Pop.
3059223 3061517 I don't like all that Chinese music,<br />all that noise.
3061600 3065062 Go in there and wash up, Gabe.<br />I'll fix you a sandwich.
3065145 3067815 Troy mad at me.
3067898 3069233 What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?
3069316 3072152 He think Troy mad at him 'cause<br />he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.
3072236 3074321 I ain't mad at the man.<br />He can live where he want to live at.
3074405 3076574 Well, what he move over there for?<br />Miss Pearl don't like nobody.
3076657 3078409 She don't mind him none.<br />She treat him real nice.
3078492 3079952 She just don't allow all that singing.
3080035 3082580 She don't mind that rent he be paying.<br />That's what she don't mind.
3082663 3084206 Troy, I ain't goin' through that<br />with you no more.
3084290 3086083 He moved over there<br />'cause he wanted his own place.
3086166 3087251 He can come and go as he please.
3087334 3089420 He can come and go as he please here.<br />I wasn't stoppin' him.
3089503 3090754 I wasn't putting no rules on the man.
3090838 3092590 That ain't the same thing,<br />and you know it.
3092673 3093924 Now that's the last<br />I wanna hear about that.
3094008 3096176 I don't wanna hear nothin' else<br />about Gabe and Miss Pearl.
3096260 3098929 - And next week...<br />- I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.
3099013 3101140 And next week, when<br />that recruiter come from that school,
3101223 3103934 I want you to sign that paper<br />and go on and let Cory play football.
3104018 3105728 That'll be the last<br />I have to hear about that.
3110399 3112401 Cory got recruited?<br />What school he goin' to?
3112526 3114111 I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.
3114194 3116363 Boy walking around here<br />smelling his piss,
3116447 3117906 thinking he gonna do<br />what he want to do,
3117990 3120284 irregardless of what I say.
3120367 3122620 Look here, Bono,<br />I left the Commissioner's office
3122703 3124121 and went down to the A&P.
3124204 3126415 That boy ain't workin' down there,<br />he lied to me.
3126498 3129835 Tellin' me he got his job back,<br />tellin' me he workin' weekend,
3129918 3131462 tellin' me he workin' after school.
3131545 3133797 Mr. Stawicki says<br />he ain't working down there at all.
3133881 3135090 Cory just growing up.
3135174 3137217 He just bustin' at the seams,<br />tryin' to fill out your shoes.
3137301 3138469 I don't care what he doing.
3138552 3140638 When he get to the place<br />where he want to disobey me,
3140721 3143891 then it's time for him to move on.<br />Bono will tell you that.
3143974 3147645 I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy<br />without paying the consequences.
3147728 3149980 I ain't never had the chance.
3150064 3153692 My daddy came on through,<br />but I ain't never knew him to see him.
3153776 3156362 Or what he had on his mind,<br />or where he went.
3156445 3160115 Just moving on through.<br />Searching out the New Land.
3160991 3163327 That's what the old folks used to call it.
3163410 3166830 See a fella moving around<br />from place to place, woman to woman,
3166914 3169333 they call it<br />"Searching out the New Land."
3169416 3171043 I can't say if he ever found it.
3171794 3174296 I come along, didn't want no kids.
3174755 3176757 I didn't know if I was gonna<br />be in one place long enough
3176840 3178842 to fix on 'em right as their daddy.
3178926 3181053 I figured I was going searching, too.
3181136 3183347 As it turn out,<br />I been hooked up with Lucille
3183430 3185849 for near about as long as<br />your daddy been with Rose.
3185933 3188060 Going on 16 years.
3188143 3190020 Sometimes, I wish<br />I'd never known my daddy.
3190104 3193899 He ain't cared nothing about no kids.<br />A kid to him wasn't nothing.
3194274 3197444 All he wanted you to do<br />was learn how to walk,
3197528 3199196 so he could start you to working.
3199279 3203033 Come to eating, he ate first.<br />Anything left over, that's what you got.
3203117 3206203 Man would sit down, eat two chickens,<br />and give you the wing.
3206286 3209540 You ought to stop that, Pop.<br />Everybody feed their kids.
3209623 3212751 No matter how hard times is,<br />everybody care about their kids.
3212835 3214044 Make sure they have something to eat.
3214128 3215879 Only thing my daddy cared about
3215963 3217715 was getting them bales<br />of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.
3217798 3219842 That's the only thing<br />that mattered to him.
3219925 3222094 Sometimes, I used to wonder<br />why he was still living,
3222177 3224722 why the devil hadn't come and got him.
3224972 3226890 "Get them bales of cotton<br />in to Mr. Lubin."
3226974 3228308 Find out he owe him money.
3228392 3229560 He should have just went on and left
3229643 3230602 when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.
3230686 3231729 That's what I would've done.
3231812 3234732 How he gonna leave with 11 kids?<br />And where he gonna go?
3234815 3237985 He ain't knew nothing but how to farm.<br />No, he was trapped.
3238402 3241572 I think he knew it, too.<br />But I'll say this for him...
3241655 3243407 He felt a responsibility toward us.
3243490 3245492 May not have treated us<br />like I felt he should have,
3245576 3249496 but without that responsibility,<br />he could have run off and left us,
3249580 3250914 made his own way.
3250998 3252416 A lot of them did.
3252499 3254084 Back in those days,<br />what you talkin' about?
3254168 3255794 They walk out their front door
3255878 3259089 and take off down one road or another<br />and just keep on walkin'.
3259173 3261091 There you go.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
3261175 3264511 Just keep on walking<br />till they come to something else.
3264595 3267931 Ain't you never heard of nobody<br />having the walking blues?
3268015 3270476 Now, that's what you call it<br />when you just take off like that.
3271101 3274438 My daddy ain't had no walking blues.<br />What you talking about?
3274521 3275981 He stayed right there with his family,
3276857 3280778 but he was just as evil as he could be!
3280861 3284531 My mama couldn't stand him.<br />Couldn't stand that evilness.
3284615 3287618 She run off when I was about eight.
3287701 3290829 She sneaked off one night,<br />told me she was coming back for me.
3290913 3292623 I ain't never seen her no more.
3292706 3296835 All his women run off and left him.<br />He wasn't good for nobody.
3297377 3299046 My turn come to head out.
3299129 3300464 I was 14,
3300547 3303425 got to sniffing around<br />Joe Canewell's daughter.
3304802 3307137 We had this old mule called "Greyboy".
3307221 3309348 My daddy sent me out<br />to do some plowing.
3309431 3313101 I got to fooling around<br />with Joe Canewell's daughter.
3313185 3316396 Found us a nice spot,<br />got real cozy with each other.
3316480 3319691 She was about 13,<br />so we done figured we grown anyway.
3319775 3322152 So, we were down there by<br />the creek, enjoying ourselves,
3322236 3323654 ain't thinking about nothing.
3323737 3326031 Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,
3326114 3329576 wandered back to the house,<br />and my daddy was lookin' for me.
3329827 3333330 So, we down there enjoying ourselves<br />when he come up on us.
3333413 3335499 Surprised us.
3335582 3338126 Had them leather straps off that mule,
3338210 3341255 commenced to whupping me<br />like there was no tomorrow.
3341338 3343924 I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.
3344591 3346718 I was scared of my daddy.
3346927 3348929 Now, when he commenced<br />to whipping on me,
3349012 3350722 quite naturally,<br />I run to get out of the way.
3350806 3353475 Now, I think he's mad<br />'cause I ain't done my work.
3353559 3358188 But I see where he's chasing me off,<br />so he can have the gal for himself.
3359606 3361733 When I see what the matter of it was,
3362609 3366864 I lost all fear of my daddy,<br />and right there, I became a man.
3366947 3369366 Fourteen years of age.
3369449 3372369 Now, it's my turn to run him off.
3372452 3374246 I picked up them same reins<br />he used on me.
3374329 3377916 I picked up them reins,<br />I commenced to whupping on him.
3378959 3381295 Gal jump up, she run off.
3383213 3384423 When he turned to face me,
3384506 3386383 I knew why the devil<br />never come and get him
3386466 3388635 'cause he was the devil himself.
3389970 3392514 I don't know what happened.
3392598 3395809 I woke up, laying there by the creek,
3395893 3399563 and Blue, this old dog we had,<br />he was licking my face.
3399646 3402691 Both my eyes were swoll shut.
3402774 3404610 I thought I was blind,<br />I couldn't see nothing.
3404693 3408405 I just laid there and cried.
3413952 3416872 And I didn't know what I was gonna do.
3416955 3421418 But I knew the time had come<br />for me to leave my daddy's house.
3422669 3425005 Suddenly, the world got big, and...
3428091 3432012 It was a long time before I could<br />cut it down to where I could handle it.
3433680 3436516 Part of that cutting down<br />was where I got to the place
3436600 3438602 where I could feel him<br />kicking in my blood,
3438685 3440270 and I knew the only thing<br />that separated us
3440354 3442481 was a matter of a few years.
3445525 3446860 What you got there, Uncle Gabe?
3447861 3449321 I got me a ham sandwich.
3449404 3451573 Rose gave me a ham sandwich.
3454034 3456203 I lost touch with everybody<br />except Gabriel.
3461208 3462209 But...
3465879 3467714 I hope he's dead.
3471969 3474638 I hope he found some peace.
3474721 3476765 That's a heavy story, Pop.
3478141 3481979 I didn't know you left home<br />when you was 14.
3482062 3484106 Fourteen's kinda young<br />to be on your own.
3484189 3486066 I don't know what I would've done.
3486858 3489653 Well, I got up from that creek,<br />walked on down to Mobile.
3489736 3493407 I was through with farming.<br />I figured I'd do better in the cities.
3493490 3495325 So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.
3495409 3498996 Wait a minute,<br />you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.
3499079 3503166 Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.<br />You talking about some walking there!
3503250 3506003 That's the only way you got anywhere<br />back in them days.
3506086 3508922 Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have<br />hitched a ride with somebody.
3509006 3510674 Who you gonna hitch it with?
3510757 3512551 There ain't no cars<br />and things like they got now.
3512634 3514261 We talking about 1918.
3514344 3515929 What you all out here gettin' into?
3516013 3518181 I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.
3518265 3519558 He don't know nothing<br />about this I'm talking.
3519641 3522394 Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.<br />She says you supposed to pick her up.
3522477 3524229 Yeah, okay, Rose.
3524312 3527024 I walked on down to Mobile,
3527107 3530402 hitched up with some fellows<br />that was coming up this way.
3530485 3532112 Got up here and found out,
3532195 3533739 not only could you not get a job,
3533822 3535365 you couldn't find no place to live.
3535449 3538076 I thought I was in freedom.
3538368 3540746 Colored folks living down there<br />on the riverbanks
3540829 3543081 in whatever kind of shelter<br />they could find for themselves.
3543165 3545625 Right down there<br />under the Brady Street Bridge.
3546043 3549379 Living down there in shacks<br />made out of sticks and tar paper.
3550380 3552132 Messed around down there.
3552215 3554718 Went from bad to worse.<br />Started stealing.
3554801 3557387 First, it was food.<br />Then I figure I steal me some money,
3557471 3559973 I can buy me some food,<br />buy me some shoes, too.
3560265 3562059 One thing led to another.<br />Met your mama.
3562476 3564811 I was young, anxious to be a man.
3565353 3567731 I met your mama and had you.<br />Why'd I do that for?
3567814 3570233 Now, I got to worry about<br />feeding you and her.
3570317 3571818 Got to steal three times as much.
3572652 3576031 I went out one day<br />looking for somebody to rob.
3576156 3577449 That's what I was, I was a robber.
3578158 3579743 I'mma tell you the truth.
3579826 3581745 I'm ashamed of it today,<br />but it's the truth.
3582788 3584664 I went to rob this fella,<br />I pull out my knife.
3584748 3586917 He pulled out a gun,<br />shot me in the chest.
3587000 3590253 It felt like somebody had taken<br />a hot branding iron and laid it on me.
3590337 3593340 Now, when he shot me,<br />I jumped at him with my knife,
3595258 3597094 and they say I killed him.
3597177 3599221 Locked me up, put me in<br />the penitentiary for 15 years.
3599304 3600680 That's where I met Bono.
3601223 3603517 Where I learned how to play baseball.
3603600 3605102 Got out that place,<br />and your mama had taken you,
3605185 3607187 went on to make a life without me.
3607270 3609356 Fifteen years was a long time<br />for her to wait.
3609439 3611316 But that 15 years<br />cured me of that robbing stuff.
3611399 3612776 Rose'll tell you.
3612859 3615112 I first met her, she ask me if I had
3615195 3617364 gotten all that foolishness<br />out of my system.
3617447 3619282 I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball,
3619366 3621076 "all what count to me."<br />You hear me, Bono?
3621159 3623787 And I meant it, too.<br />She said, "Which one come first?"
3623870 3626957 I said, "Well, ain't no<br />doubt it's baseball.
3627040 3629000 "But you stick and get old with me,
3629084 3630627 "and we'll both outlive this baseball."
3630710 3632838 Am I right, Rose?
3634047 3635132 And it's true.
3635215 3636967 Man, hush your mouth.<br />You ain't say no such thing.
3637050 3639636 Talkin' about, "Baby, you know<br />you'll always be number one with me."
3639719 3642305 That's what you was talking.
3642389 3644891 - That's why I love this woman.<br />- Rose will keep you straight.
3644975 3647060 You get off the track,<br />she'll straighten you up.
3647144 3648520 Lyons, you better get on up<br />and get Bonnie.
3648603 3650063 She waiting on you.
3650147 3651439 - Hey, Pop.<br />- Yeah?
3651523 3653567 You ought to come down to the Grill,<br />hear me play.
3654192 3655902 Man, I ain't goin' down there.
3655986 3657445 I'm too old to be hanging out<br />in them clubs.
3657529 3660782 You got to be good to<br />play down at the Grill.
3660866 3662367 Come on, Pop.
3662450 3666246 - I got to get up in the morning.<br />- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

3683221 3685182 and bring Bonnie,<br />you know I'm always glad to see her.
3685265 3688768 I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.
3688852 3690353 - See you, Pop.<br />- All right.
3690437 3692522 See you, Mr. Bono.
3692606 3695650 - See you, Uncle Gabe!<br />- Lyons! King of the Jungle!

3702157 3706328 Hell, woman, it's Bono. Bono like family.<br />I done know this nigger since...
3706411 3708872 - How long have I known you?<br />- It's been a long time.
3708955 3711374 I done known this nigger<br />since Skippy was a pup!
3711458 3713293 Me and him done<br />been through some times!
3713376 3715045 You sure are right about that.
3715128 3717130 Hell, I known him<br />longer than I known you, Rose,
3717214 3719049 and we still standin'<br />shoulder to shoulder.
3719132 3722510 Look here, Bono,<br />a man can't ask for no more than that.
3722594 3723845 I love you, nigger.
3723929 3725889 Hell! I love you, too.
3725972 3728975 But I got to get home, see my woman.<br />You got yours in hand.
3729351 3730810 I got to go get mine.
3732771 3734648 What you do that for, Pop?
3734731 3736066 What's the matter?<br />Cory, what's the matter?
3736149 3737901 Pop done went up to the school<br />and told Coach Zellman
3737984 3739152 I can't play football no more.
3739236 3740779 Wouldn't even let me play the game.
3740862 3742364 Told him to tell the recruiter<br />not to come.
3742447 3744241 - Troy.<br />- What you Troying me for?
3744324 3745909 Yeah, I did it.<br />And the boy knows why I did it.
3745992 3747869 Why you wanna do that to me?<br />That was the one chance I had!
3747953 3749412 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with Cory playing football, Troy.
3749496 3750622 The boy lied to me.
3750705 3753250 I told the nigger,<br />"You want to play football,
3753333 3754584 "you keep up with your chores
3754668 3757212 "hold that job down at the A&P."<br />That was the conditions.
3757295 3758755 I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...
3758838 3761549 I can't work after school<br />during the football season, Pop.
3761633 3763802 I tried to tell you<br />Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.
3763885 3765220 You don't never want to listen to nobody,
3765303 3766596 and then<br />you wanna go and do this to me?
3766680 3768223 I ain't done nothin' to you.<br />You done it to yourself.
3768306 3769933 Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!
3770016 3772018 You're just scared<br />I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!
3777816 3779025 - Come here.<br />- Troy.
3779734 3780735 Troy.
3787701 3789035 Pick it up.
3798044 3799671 Put it on.

3814894 3816229 All right.
3817814 3819566 See, you done made a mistake.
3819733 3822277 - I didn't even do nothing!<br />- I'll tell you what your mistake was.
3823069 3826656 You swung at the ball<br />and you didn't hit it.
3826740 3830410 That's strike one.<br />You in the batter's box now.
3831036 3833580 You swung and you missed, see?
3834831 3836082 That's strike one.
3839127 3842047 Don't you strike out.
3935140 3938017 Cory, why don't you come on in here,<br />help me clean out these cupboards.

3945525 3946818 Police done arrested him again.
3946901 3948611 Said he was disturbing the peace.
3948695 3950029 He'll be back directly.
3950113 3952699 Come on in here and help me<br />clean out these cupboards.
3952782 3954033 Come on.
3964377 3966254 Troy, what they say down there?
3966337 3969632 They ain't said nothing.<br />I give them $50, they let him go.
3969716 3971593 I'll talk to you about it.
3971676 3972677 Where Cory?
3972760 3975096 He in the house,<br />helping me clean out these cupboards.
3975180 3977056 All right, tell him to<br />get his butt out here.
3979559 3981519 All they want is the money.
3981603 3983813 This makes six, seven times,<br />I done went down there and got him.
3983897 3986107 See me coming,<br />they stick out their hands.
3986191 3988943 Yeah, I know what you mean.<br />That's all they care about, that money.
3989027 3991112 They don't care about what's right.
3992489 3996951 Nigger, why you got to go<br />and get some hardwood?
3997035 3999329 You ain't doing nothin'<br />but building a little old fence.
3999412 4001331 Get you some soft pinewood.<br />That's all you need.
4001414 4002999 I know what I'm doing.<br />This outside wood.
4003082 4005335 You put pinewood inside the house.
4005418 4008463 Pinewood inside wood.<br />This here the outside wood.
4008546 4010757 Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?
4012175 4013968 You don't need this wood.
4014052 4015512 You can put it up with pinewood,
4015595 4017889 and it'll stand as long as<br />you gonna be here looking at it.
4017972 4019432 How you know<br />how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?
4019516 4021184 Hell, I might live forever.
4021267 4023895 I'll live longer than old man Horsely.
4023978 4025688 That's what Magee used to say.
4025772 4028107 Magee a damn fool.<br />Now you tell me who you ever heard of
4028191 4031236 gonna pull their own teeth<br />with a pair of rusty pliers?
4031319 4032445 They're old folks.
4032529 4034447 My granddaddy used to<br />pull his teeth with pliers.
4034531 4036658 They ain't had no dentists<br />for colored folk back then.
4036741 4039285 Well, get clean pliers.<br />You understand? Clean pliers.
4039369 4041913 Sterilize them.<br />Besides, we ain't living back then.
4042372 4045166 All he had to do<br />was go down to Doc Goldblum's.
4045250 4047794 I see where you and<br />that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,
4048419 4050380 see where you all done got tight.
4050463 4051756 What you mean, "got tight"?
4051839 4053883 I see where you be laughing<br />and joking with her all the time.
4053967 4056678 I laugh and joke with 'em all.<br />Bono, you know me.
4056761 4058763 Ain't the kind of laughing and joking<br />I'm talking about.
4060473 4061891 How you doing, Mr. Bono?
4061975 4063685 Cory, get that saw from Bono<br />and cut some wood.
4063768 4066187 He talking about wood too hard to cut.
4066271 4067897 Stand back there, Jim.
4067981 4069232 Let the young boy<br />show you how it's done.
4069315 4071484 He's sure welcome to it.
4075863 4080118 Look at that.<br />Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.
4081327 4082787 Hell, I must be getting old
4082870 4084831 the way I'm watching that boy<br />whip through that wood.
4085039 4087458 I don't see why Mama<br />wants a fence around no yard no way.
4087542 4088585 Damn if I know, either.
4088668 4090753 I don't know what the hell<br />she keeping out with it.
4090837 4092839 She ain't got nothing nobody wants.
4094090 4095967 Some people build fences<br />to keep people out,
4096050 4098344 and other people build fences<br />to keep people in.
4099304 4101639 Rose wants to hold on to you all.<br />She loves you.
4102348 4105351 Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody<br />to tell me my wife loves me.
4105435 4108938 Cory, go in the house<br />and see if you can find the other saw.
4109022 4110690 Where's it at?
4110773 4113568 I said find it. Look for<br />it till you find it.
4116362 4119741 What is that supposed to mean?<br />Want to keep us in?
4134339 4135423 Troy,
4136257 4139802 I done known you seem like<br />damn near my whole life.
4139886 4142639 You and Rose both.<br />I known both of you all for a long time.
4143723 4146184 I remember when you met Rose.
4146267 4149228 When you was hitting them baseball<br />out of the park.
4149604 4151856 A lot of them old gals<br />was after you then.
4151939 4153900 You had the pick of the litter.
4153983 4157612 When you picked Rose,<br />I was happy for you.
4158488 4161866 That's the first time<br />I knew you had any sense.
4162241 4165161 I said, "My man Troy<br />knows what he's doing.
4165244 4168414 "I'm gonna follow this nigger,<br />he might take me somewhere."
4168790 4170833 I been following you, too.
4170917 4174462 I done learned a whole heap of things<br />about life watching you.
4175963 4179217 I done learned how to tell<br />where the shit lies.
4179300 4181594 How to tell it from the alfalfa.
4182303 4184806 You done learned me a lot of things.
4184889 4187475 Showed me how to not<br />make the same mistakes.
4187975 4189769 To take life as it come along,
4189852 4192522 keep putting one foot<br />in front of the other.
4192980 4195650 - Rose is a good woman, Troy.<br />- I know she a good woman.
4195733 4197235 I've been married to her for 18 years.
4197318 4198695 What you got on your mind, Bono?
4198778 4201155 I just say she's a good woman,<br />like I say anything.
4201239 4202573 I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.
4202657 4204033 You just say she a good woman<br />and leave it
4204117 4205076 hanging out there like that?
4205159 4206244 Why are you telling me<br />she a good woman?
4206327 4209163 She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.
4209247 4210456 You saying I don't measure up?
4210540 4211791 That's what you tryin' to say.
4211874 4213584 I don't measure up<br />'cause I'm seeing this other gal.
4213668 4214836 I know what you tryin' to say.
4214919 4217088 I know what Rose means to you, Troy.
4217171 4220133 I'm just tryin' to say<br />I don't want to see you mess up.
4222135 4223302 Yeah.
4227014 4229684 Well, I appreciate that, Bono.
4231728 4235398 If you was messing around on Lucille,<br />I'd be telling you the same thing.
4235481 4236983 That's all I got to say.
4238025 4240987 I just say that 'cause I love you both.
4242363 4244031 Yeah.
4244866 4247368 You know me.<br />I wasn't out there looking for nothing.
4247452 4249871 You can't find a better woman<br />than Rose, I know that.
4250204 4253040 But it seems like this woman<br />just stuck on to me
4253124 4254292 where I can't shake her loose.
4254375 4255960 I done wrestled with it<br />and tried to throw her off,
4256043 4258463 but now she stuck on tighter.
4258546 4260882 And now she stuck on for good.
4260965 4263718 You's in control.<br />That's what you tell me all the time.
4263801 4265553 You responsible for what you do.
4265636 4267388 I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.
4267472 4269891 As long as it set right in my heart,<br />then I'm okay.
4269974 4272894 'Cause that's all I listen to.<br />It tell me right and wrong every time.
4272977 4274812 And I ain't talking about<br />doing Rose no bad turn.
4274896 4276314 I love Rose.
4276397 4277940 She done carried me a long ways,
4278024 4279400 and I love and respect her for that.
4279484 4280651 I know you do.
4280735 4282820 That's why I don't want<br />to see you hurt her.
4282904 4285323 But what you gonna do<br />when she finds out?
4285740 4287825 What you got then?
4287909 4289327 You try to juggle both of them,
4289410 4291162 sooner or later,<br />you gonna drop one of them.
4291245 4293456 - That's common sense.<br />- I know what you're saying, Bono.
4295166 4297210 I been trying to figure a way<br />to work it out.
4297293 4299337 Work it out right, Troy.
4299420 4302089 I ain't trying to get all up<br />between you and Rose's business,
4302173 4304342 but work it, so it come out right.
4304425 4306677 Hell, I get all between<br />you and Lucille's business.
4306761 4308262 And when you gonna buy that woman
4308346 4309722 that refrigerator she be wanting?
4309806 4311474 And don't tell me<br />you ain't got no money.
4311557 4312850 I know who your banker is.
4312934 4315436 Mellon don't need that money<br />as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.
4315520 4316521 I know that.
4316604 4317730 - Tell you what I'll do.<br />- What?
4317814 4319816 When you finish building<br />this fence for Rose,
4319899 4321526 I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.
4321609 4324487 You done stuck your foot<br />in your mouth now.
4325613 4327198 Hey, nigger, where you going?
4327281 4328533 I'm going home.
4328616 4330451 I know you don't expect me<br />to help you now.
4330535 4331953 I'm protecting my money.
4332453 4335373 I want to see you put<br />that fence up by yourself.
4335456 4337041 That's what I want to see.
4337124 4339377 You'll be here<br />another six months without me.
4339460 4340795 Nigger, you ain't right.
4340878 4342547 When it come to my money,
4342630 4345716 I'm right as fireworks<br />on the Fourth of July.
4345800 4348970 We gonna see.<br />You better get out your bank book!
4400980 4403065 What they say down there?<br />What's happening with Gabe?
4403149 4406110 I went down there<br />and got him out. Cost me $50.
4406193 4407653 Said he was disturbing the peace.
4407737 4410156 Judge set up a hearing for him<br />in three weeks
4410239 4412825 to show cause<br />why he shouldn't be recommitted.
4412909 4414619 What'd you say?<br />What'd you tell the judge?
4414994 4416621 I told him I'd take care of him.
4416704 4418289 It didn't make no sense<br />to recommit the man.
4418372 4419749 He stuck out his big greasy palm,
4419832 4422501 told me to give him $50<br />and take him on home.
4422585 4424503 Where's he at now?<br />Where'd he go off to?
4424587 4426505 Gone about his business.<br />He don't need nobody to hold his hand.
4426589 4428799 Well, I don't know, seem like that<br />would be the best place for him.
4428883 4429884 To put him in a hospital.
4429967 4431093 I know what you gonna say,
4431177 4432553 but that's what I think would be best.
4432637 4434263 Man had his life ruined<br />fighting for what?
4434347 4435598 Now, they want to take him<br />and lock him up?
4435681 4438017 Let him be free.<br />Man ain't bothering nobody.
4439018 4441938 Everybody got their own way<br />of looking at it, I guess.
4442021 4443272 Come on, get your lunch.
4443356 4444941 I got some lima beans<br />and cornbread in the oven.
4445024 4446108 Come on, get somethin' to eat.
4446192 4447818 Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.
4447902 4449111 Rose, I got something to tell you.
4449236 4452073 - Wait till I put the food on the table.<br />- Rose...
4452907 4455743 Now, I don't know how to tell you this.
4459664 4461707 And I can't explain it none.
4461791 4464961 It just sort of grows on you.
4465962 4470466 It started off like a little bush,<br />next thing you know, it's a whole forest.
4470549 4473761 - Troy, what is you talking about?<br />- I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.
4473844 4475638 I'm trying to tell you,
4475721 4478140 find a way to tell you that
4483229 4485564 I'm gonna be a daddy.
4487733 4489986 Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.
4494573 4497326 Troy, you ain't telling me this.<br />You're gonna be what?
4497410 4498703 - You're gonna be somebody's daddy?<br />- Rose...
4498786 4499870 You're telling your wife this?
4499954 4500997 Now...
4501080 4503332 Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!
4503416 4506002 I got to wait 18 years<br />to hear something like this?
4506085 4507336 Hey, Rose.
4509255 4511590 I got a flower for you.
4514260 4517847 That's a rose.<br />The same rose like you is.
4522852 4524270 Thanks, Gabe.
4524353 4525771 Troy, you ain't mad at me?
4525855 4527273 Them bad mens come<br />and put me away.
4527356 4529775 - You ain't mad at me?<br />- No. No, I ain't mad at you.
4529859 4531777 Eighteen years,<br />and you want to come with this?
4531861 4534530 See what I got?<br />Got a brand-new quarter.
4537450 4538534 Rose, it's just that...
4538617 4540786 Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.<br />Ain't no explaining it.
4540870 4543539 The fella that give me this quarter<br />had a whole mess of 'em!
4543622 4546125 I'm gonna keep this quarter<br />till it stops shining.
4546208 4548753 Gabe, go on up front now.<br />I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.
4548836 4550004 Go on. I'll get you a piece.
4550087 4552798 Say, Rose, you know,<br />I was chasing hellhounds,
4552882 4555801 and them bad mens come<br />and get me and take me away.
4555885 4557887 Troy helped me.<br />He come down there and told them
4557970 4560890 they better let me go<br />before he beat them up!
4560973 4562224 Yeah, he did!
4562308 4564602 Go up front now, Gabe.<br />I'll get you some watermelon.
4564685 4566145 Them bad men is gone now.
4566228 4568606 Okay. Rose gonna give me<br />some watermelon,
4568689 4571150 the kind with the stripes on it.
4576655 4578074 Why, Troy?
4579825 4581077 Why?
4581160 4586582 After all these years,<br />you come dragging this in to me now?
4586665 4588834 It don't make no sense at your age.
4589502 4593339 I could've expected this 10,<br />or 15 years ago, but not now.
4593589 4595841 Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.
4599929 4603182 I done tried to be everything<br />a wife should be.
4605184 4606477 Everything a wife could be.
4606560 4607853 I've been married 18 years,
4607937 4610439 and now,<br />I got to live to see the day you tell me
4610523 4614026 you been seeing another woman<br />and done fathered a child by her.
4627206 4631210 And you know I never wanted<br />no half-nothing in my family!
4634213 4635464 My whole family is half.
4635548 4637383 Everybody got different<br />fathers and mothers
4637466 4638968 and my two sisters and my brothers.
4639051 4640636 You could hardly tell who's who.
4640719 4642471 Could never sit down<br />and talk about Papa and Mama.
4642555 4645182 It was always your papa,<br />your mama, my papa, my mama.
4645266 4647810 And I ain't never wanted that<br />for none of my children!
4647893 4649186 And now,<br />you want to drag your behind in here
4649270 4650396 and tell me something like this!
4650479 4652439 Stop it now. You ought to know.<br />It's time for you to know.
4652523 4654233 Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!
4674253 4675337 Rose?
4678424 4681844 I just can't make it go away.<br />It's done now.
4681927 4685848 I can't wish the circumstances<br />of the thing away.
4686015 4688601 And you don't want to, either.
4688684 4690477 Maybe you want to wish<br />me and my boy away.
4690561 4691937 Maybe that's what you want.
4692021 4694523 Well, you can't wish us away.
4694607 4696567 I got 18 years of my life invested in you.
4696650 4698694 You ought to have stayed upstairs<br />in my bed where you belong.
4698777 4701363 Now, listen to me.<br />We can get a handle on this thing.
4701447 4703282 We can talk this out,<br />come to an understanding.
4703365 4704617 All of a sudden it's "we."
4704700 4705951 Where was "we" at<br />when you were down there,
4706035 4707369 rolling around<br />with some godforsaken woman?
4707453 4708662 "We" should've<br />come to an understanding
4708746 4710289 before you started making<br />a damn fool of yourself!
4710372 4711790 You're a day late and a dollar short
4711874 4713250 when it comes<br />to an understanding with me.
4713334 4719089 Rose, it's just that<br />she gives me a different idea.
4719590 4722760 A different understanding about myself.
4722843 4726305 I can step out of this house<br />and get away from the pressures
4726388 4727765 and the problems, be a different man.
4727848 4729642 I ain't got to worry about<br />how I'll get the roof fixed,
4729725 4731352 or pay the bills, or...
4731435 4732770 I can just
4734730 4737316 be a part of myself<br />I ain't never been before.
4738525 4740694 What I want to know is...
4743197 4745699 What I want to know
4745783 4748452 is do you plan to continue seeing her?
4748535 4750829 That's all you can say to me.
4752122 4756210 I could sit up in her house and laugh.<br />You understand what I'm saying?
4756293 4758879 I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.
4758963 4761215 It reaches all the way down<br />to the bottom of my shoes.
4761298 4762466 Rose, I...
4764885 4767680 I can't give that up.
4773477 4775646 Well, maybe you ought to go on<br />and stay down there with her,
4775729 4777398 if she's a better woman than me.
4777481 4779233 It ain't about nobody being<br />a better woman, or nothing.
4779316 4780651 Rose, you ain't to blame.
4780734 4782987 A man couldn't ask<br />for a better wife than you've been.
4783070 4784571 I'm responsible for it.
4784655 4786198 I done locked myself into a pattern,
4786282 4788284 trying to take care of you all,<br />that I forgot about myself.
4788367 4789994 Well, what the hell was I there for?
4790077 4791620 That was my job, not somebody else's.
4791704 4794832 Rose, listen to me.<br />I done tried all my life to live decent.
4794915 4797835 To live a clean, hard, useful life.
4797918 4801088 I try to be a good husband to you,<br />in every way I know how.
4801171 4803340 Maybe I come into the world backwards,<br />I don't know,
4803424 4806760 but you're born with two strikes on you<br />before you come to the plate.
4806844 4807970 You got to guard it closely,
4808053 4810681 always looking for the curveball<br />on the inside corner.
4810764 4812391 You can't afford a called strike.
4812474 4813851 You can't let nothing get past you.
4813934 4816020 If you're going down,<br />you're doing down swinging.
4816103 4818856 Everything lined up against you!
4820524 4822026 What you gonna do?
4823652 4826071 I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.
4826530 4830367 When I found you and Cory<br />and a halfway decent job, I was safe.
4830451 4832619 Couldn't nothing touch me!
4832703 4834163 I wasn't gonna strike out no more.
4834246 4835622 I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.
4835706 4838083 I wasn't gonna lie in the street<br />with a bottle of wine.
4838167 4842421 I was safe. I had me a family, a job.
4843630 4846300 I wasn't gonna get that last strike.
4848093 4850971 I was standing on first base,
4851055 4853015 waiting for one of them boys<br />to knock me in, to bring me home.
4853098 4854892 You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
4854975 4856393 Then I saw the gal,<br />she firmed up my backbone.
4856477 4859438 I got to thinkin' that if I tried,<br />maybe I could steal second.
4859521 4860981 - You understand?<br />- You should've held me tight.
4861065 4864485 - You should've grabbed me and held on.<br />- I stood on first base for 18 years,
4864568 4866945 and I thought, well,<br />God damn it, go on for it!
4867029 4869448 We ain't talking about baseball!
4869531 4871825 We talking about you going off<br />and laying up with another woman,
4871909 4872910 then bringing it home to me.
4872993 4875287 That's what we're talking about.<br />We're not talkin' about no baseball!
4875371 4876538 Rose, you're not listening to me.
4876622 4879500 I'm trying to explain it to you<br />the best way I know how.
4881085 4882378 It's not easy for me to admit
4882461 4885547 that I've been standing<br />in the same place for 18 years!
4885631 4888175 Well, I've been standing with you!
4888258 4892262 I've been right here with you, Troy!<br />I got a life, too.
4892346 4896600 I gave 18 years of my life<br />to stand in the same spot as you!
4896683 4898644 Don't you think<br />I ever wanted other things?
4898727 4900854 Don't you think<br />I had dreams and hopes?
4900938 4903524 What about my life? What about me?
4903607 4904942 Don't you think it ever crossed my mind
4905025 4906193 to want to know other men?
4906276 4910614 That I wanted to lay up somewhere<br />and forget about my responsibilities?
4910697 4912282 That I wanted someone<br />to make me laugh,
4912366 4914410 so I could feel good?
4914493 4916578 You're not the only one<br />who's got wants and needs.
4916662 4918580 But I held on to you, Troy.
4918664 4922835 I took all my feelings,<br />my wants and needs and dreams,
4922918 4924711 and I buried them inside you.
4924795 4927089 I planted a seed<br />and watched and prayed over it.
4927172 4930175 I planted myself inside you<br />and waited to bloom!
4930259 4934096 And it didn't take me no 18 years<br />to realize the soil was hard and rocky,
4934179 4936265 and it wasn't never gonna bloom!
4936348 4939268 But I held on to you, Troy.<br />I held you tighter.
4939351 4941353 You was my husband.
4941437 4944064 I owed you everything I had.
4944148 4946859 Every part of me I could find to give you.
4946942 4950779 And upstairs in that bedroom,<br />with the darkness falling in on me,
4950863 4954950 I gave everything I had<br />to try and erase the doubt
4955033 4957703 that you wasn't the finest man<br />in the world.
4957786 4960497 And wherever you was going,<br />I was gonna be there with you,
4960581 4963041 because you was my husband.
4964460 4967463 'Cause that's the only way<br />I was gonna survive as your wife.
4968714 4972384 You always talking about what you give<br />and what you don't have to give.
4973093 4974803 But you take, too, Troy.
4974887 4977514 You take and<br />don't even know nobody's giving.
4977598 4978599 You say I take and don't give.
4978682 4979850 Troy, you're hurting me.
4979933 4981852 - Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!<br />- I gave you everything I got.
4981935 4983187 Don't you tell that lie on me.
4983270 4984688 - Mama!<br />- Don't you tell that lie!
4984771 4986273 Troy, you're hurting me!
4986899 4988233 Troy! Troy!
4988650 4992321 All right. That's strike two.
4993155 4997367 You stay away from around me, boy.<br />Don't you strike out.
4999036 5001038 You're living with a full count.
5004583 5006418 Don't you strike out!
5206868 5208704 Troy, I want to talk to you.
5211373 5213458 All of a sudden?
5215460 5217963 After all this time,<br />you want to talk to me, huh?
5219047 5220507 You ain't wanted<br />to talk to me in months.
5220590 5221925 You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.
5222008 5223468 You didn't want no parts of me then.
5224136 5226138 What you want to talk to me about now?
5229766 5232728 - Tomorrow's Friday.<br />- I know what day tomorrow is.
5232811 5233979 You think I don't know<br />tomorrow's Friday?
5234062 5236231 My whole life, I ain't done nothing<br />but look to see Friday coming,
5236314 5237649 and you got to tell me it's Friday.
5237733 5239234 I want to know if you're coming home.
5239818 5242237 I always come home, Rose.<br />You know that.
5242320 5243697 Ain't never been a night<br />I ain't come home.
5243780 5245449 That ain't what I mean, and you know it.
5245657 5249077 I wanna know if you're coming<br />straight home after work.
5249161 5252122 I figured I'd cash my check,<br />hang out at Taylors' with the boys.
5252205 5253331 Maybe play a game of checkers.
5253415 5256001 Troy, I can't live like this.<br />I won't live like this.
5256084 5257461 You're living on borrowed time with me.
5257544 5259546 Been going on six months now,<br />you ain't been coming home.
5259629 5261673 I come home every night.<br />Every night of the year.
5261757 5264259 That's 365 days.
5265761 5268346 I want you to come home<br />tomorrow after work.
5273351 5277022 Rose, I don't mess up my pay.<br />You know that.
5277105 5278982 I take my pay, I give it to you.
5279065 5282444 I don't have no money<br />but what you give me back.
5282527 5285697 I just want a little time to myself.
5285781 5286948 A little time to enjoy life.
5287032 5288909 What about me?<br />When's my time to enjoy life?
5288992 5291077 I don't know what to tell you, Rose.<br />I'm doing the best I can.
5291161 5292204 You ain't been comin' home from work,
5292287 5293622 but time enough<br />to change your clothes and run out.
5293705 5295707 You wanna call that<br />the best you can do?
5297292 5300378 I'm going over to the hospital<br />to see Alberta.
5301463 5303173 She went into the hospital<br />this afternoon.
5303256 5306676 Looks like she might<br />have the baby early.
5307552 5309221 I won't be gone long.
5315644 5317395 Well, you ought to know.<br />They went over to Miss Pearl's
5317479 5318730 and got Gabe today.
5318814 5322567 She said you told them to<br />go ahead and lock him up.
5322651 5326613 I ain't said no such thing.<br />Whoever told you that is telling a lie.
5326696 5328406 Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing<br />but telling a big, fat lie.
5328490 5330367 She ain't had to tell me.<br />I read it on the papers.
5330450 5332577 - What'd it say, huh?<br />- It said you told them to take him.
5332661 5334830 Then they screwed that up,<br />just like they screw up everything.
5334913 5336164 I ain't worried about<br />what they got on that paper.
5336248 5338166 It say the government sends<br />part of the check to the hospital,
5338250 5339334 the other part to you.
5339417 5341044 I got nothing to do with that,<br />if that's the way it works.
5341127 5342254 I don't make up the rules...
5342337 5343588 You did Gabe just like you did Cory.
5343672 5344881 You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,
5344965 5346591 but you signed for Gabe!<br />You signed that paper!
5346675 5348510 I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.
5348593 5350178 Hell, the only thing I signed<br />was the release form.
5350262 5351263 Hell, I can't read,
5351346 5352681 I don't know what they had<br />on that paper.
5352764 5354599 I ain't signed nothing<br />about sending Gabe away.
5354683 5356852 I said send him to the hospital,<br />you said let him go free.
5356935 5357936 Then you went down there
5358019 5359479 and you signed him to the hospital<br />for half his money.
5359563 5361857 You went back on yourself, Troy.<br />You're gonna have to answer for that.
5361940 5363525 You just been over there<br />talking to Miss Pearl.

5608686 5610772 They say it's healthy.
5613066 5614526 I wonder who's gonna bury her.
5614609 5615652 She had a family, Rose.
5615735 5617195 She wasn't living in the world by herself.
5617278 5619572 I know she wasn't living<br />in the world by herself.
5619656 5621032 Next thing you wanna know<br />if she had any insurance.

6623575 6626286 Every time I heard<br />your footsteps in this house.
6626370 6628205 Wondering all the time,<br />"What's Pop gonna say if I do this?
6628288 6629456 "What's he gonna say if I do that?

6788031 6789700 Can't taste nothing.
6800210 6802379 I can't taste nothing.
6805382 6809136 Hallelujah!
6812055 6813557 Hallelujah.
6824067 6825485 Hallelujah.

6854014 6856767 But I ain't gonna be easy.
6869112 6870364 <i>Raynell?</i>
6870447 6872282 <i>- Ma'am?<br />- What you doing?</i>
6872366 6873492 <i>Nothing.</i>
6873575 6876119 Get in here and get dressed.<br />What are you doing?
6876203 6877871 See if my garden growed.
6878121 6879539 I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.
6879623 6880791 You got to wait.
6881041 6883752 Yeah, but it look like it ain't<br />never gonna grow, Mama. Dag!
6884294 6886797 I told you, a watched pot never boils.
6886880 6888465 This ain't even no pot, Mama.
6888548 6889549 Get in here and get dressed.
6889633 6891426 This ain't no morning<br />to be playing around, you hear me?
6892052 6893387 Yes, ma'am.
6896014 6898058 Bye, garden.
6919496 6922749 Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

6938682 6940350 Cory. Cory!
6941810 6944646 Lord have mercy! Cory.
6948900 6950235 Lookee here, y'all.
6953155 6957075 - Looka here.<br />- Done got all grown up.
6957159 6958785 Don't cry, Mama.<br />What you crying about?
6958869 6961371 I'm just so glad you made it.
6961455 6963457 Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?
6963623 6965625 Look at you, man, look at you.
6965709 6968545 Don't he look good, Rose?<br />Got on them corporal stripes.
6968628 6970046 What took you so long?
6970130 6971173 You know how the Marines are, Mama.
6971256 6972507 They got to get<br />all their paperwork straight
6972591 6973884 before they let you do anything.
6973967 6977262 Well, I'm sure glad you made it.<br />They let Lyons come.
6977345 6978722 Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.
6978805 6980682 They don't know<br />if they're gonna let him out or not.
6980765 6982225 I talked to them a little while ago.
6982309 6984644 A corporal in the United States Marines.
6984811 6988899 Your daddy knew you had it in you.<br />He used to tell me all the time.
6988982 6990901 Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?
6990984 6994654 Yeah, he reminds me of Troy<br />when I first met him.
6995655 6997157 Say, Rose,
6997240 6999576 Lucille's down at the church<br />with the choir.
6999659 7001536 I'm gonna go get<br />the pallbearers lined up.
7001620 7002829 I'll be back to get you all.
7003079 7004331 Thanks, Jim.
7004414 7005415 See you, Mr. Bono.
7009503 7012589 Cory, look at Raynell.
7012672 7013715 Ain't she precious?
7013798 7015175 She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.
7015509 7017010 Say hello to your brother.<br />This your brother, Cory.
7017093 7019429 - You remember Cory?<br />- No, ma'am.
7019513 7020597 Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.
7020680 7023225 Well, we talk about you.<br />She heard us talk about you.
7023850 7026353 This is your brother, Cory. Say hello.
7026436 7027771 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
7027854 7029064 So, you're Raynell.
7030357 7032567 Mama's told me a lot about you.
7032776 7034986 Come on, let me fix you some breakfast.<br />Keep up your strength.
7035070 7036154 I ain't hungry, Mama.
7036363 7039115 You can fix me something, Rose.<br />I'll be in there in a minute.
7039199 7040617 You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?
7040700 7042285 I know they ain't feeding you right.
7042369 7043745 No, Mama, thanks.<br />I don't feel like eating.
7043828 7044913 I'll get something later.
7046164 7048833 Raynell, get up there and<br />get that dress on like I told you.
7060136 7063223 I always knew you was gonna make<br />something out of yourself.
7064975 7067477 Your head was always<br />in the right direction.
7070480 7071565 So,
7073233 7074943 you gonna stay in?
7075026 7077320 Make it a career? Put in your 20 years?
7077737 7081324 I don't know.<br />I got six already. I think that's enough.
7081408 7084995 Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.
7085078 7086913 Ain't nothing out here.
7088498 7091334 I guess Rose told you<br />about what happened with me.
7093837 7096548 They got me down at the workhouse.
7096631 7099342 I thought I was being slick<br />cashing other people's checks.
7100677 7102429 How much time you doing?
7103263 7105765 They give me three years.
7105849 7109019 I got that beat now.<br />I ain't got but nine more months.
7114357 7116776 It ain't so bad.
7116860 7119821 You learn to deal with it<br />like anything else.
7122115 7124075 "You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights,"
7124159 7127370 that's what Papa used to say.
7127454 7131041 He used to say that when he struck out.
7131124 7133335 I seen him strike out<br />three times in a row,
7133418 7137631 and the next time up,<br />he hit the ball over the grandstand.
7137714 7140675 Right out there in Homestead Field.
7141301 7145138 He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.<br />He wanted to hit it over everything.
7146640 7148308 Then after the game,
7149893 7154397 he had 200 people standing around,<br />waiting to shake his hand.
7157817 7160403 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.
7164074 7165825 Papa was something else.
7167077 7169162 You still playing?
7169245 7170914 Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.
7171831 7174084 We got some fellas down there.<br />We got us a band.
7174167 7177170 We gonna try to stay together<br />when we get out, but...
7177253 7178338 Yeah.
7179839 7181925 I'm still playing.
7182509 7184052 Still helps me get out of bed<br />in the morning.
7184135 7185303 As long as it do that,
7185387 7188848 I'm gonna stick with it,<br />try to make some sense out of it.
7188932 7191434 Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.
7193937 7195855 Let me get in here<br />and get these eggs, man.
7195939 7197941 Get ready to go bury Papa.
7203947 7205281 How you doing?
7206950 7208368 You doing all right?
7226219 7228972 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
7229973 7231474 You used to sleep in my room?
7232767 7234769 Yeah, that used to be my room.
7235311 7238231 That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."
7240567 7242485 Got your football in the closet.
7242652 7245655 Raynell. Get up there, get dressed,<br />and put them good shoes on.
7245822 7248074 Mama, can I just wear these?<br />Them others hurt my feet!
7248158 7250034 Well, they're just gonna have<br />to hurt your feet for a while.
7250118 7251202 You ain't said they hurt your feet
7251286 7252579 when you went down<br />to the store and got 'em.
7252662 7254831 They didn't hurt then.<br />My feet done got bigger.
7254914 7256499 Don't give me no back talk!
7256583 7259419 Get up there, get dressed,<br />and put them good shoes on.
7327070 7329906 Ain't too much changed.
7329989 7332659 He still got that rag tied to the tree.
7335912 7337914 He was out here swinging that bat.
7339499 7342335 I was just getting ready<br />to go back in the house.
7343586 7346339 He swung that bat and just fell over.
7348842 7352679 Seem like, when he swung it,<br />he stood there with this grin on his face.
7358601 7360270 Then he just fell over.
7363106 7364691 They carried him<br />down there to the hospital,
7364774 7366860 but I knew there wasn't no need.
7369445 7372991 - Why don't you come on in the house?<br />- Mama, I got something to tell you.
7374367 7377537 I don't know how to tell you this,<br />but I got to tell you.
7377620 7379622 I'm not going to Papa's funeral.
7382041 7385795 Boy, hush your mouth.
7385879 7387881 That's your daddy you talking about!
7388131 7390174 I don't want to hear<br />that kind of talk this morning.
7390258 7391634 I done raised you to come to this?
7391718 7393052 You standing there<br />all healthy and grown,
7393136 7394888 talking about<br />you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?
7394971 7397140 - Mama, listen...<br />- I don't want to hear it, Cory!
7397223 7398558 Just get that thought out of your head.
7398641 7401269 I've got to say no to him.<br />One time in my life, I got to say no.
7401352 7402896 I don't got to listen to that!
7402979 7404564 Now, I know you and your daddy<br />ain't seen eye to eye,
7404647 7408067 but I don't have to listen to<br />that kind of talk this morning.
7408151 7410737 Disrespecting your daddy<br />ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.
7410820 7412572 You gotta find some way<br />to come to that on your own.
7412655 7415116 Not going to your daddy's funeral<br />ain't gonna make you a man.
7418161 7421080 The whole time I was growing up,<br />living in his house,
7421164 7424083 Papa was like a shadow<br />that followed you everywhere.
7424834 7428087 It weighed on you,<br />and it sunk into your flesh.
7428755 7430715 It would wrap around you and lay there
7430798 7433259 until you couldn't tell<br />which one was you anymore.
7433343 7437513 That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!
7437597 7439933 Trying to crawl in.<br />Trying to live through you.
7440850 7445521 Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson<br />staring right back at me.
7445605 7448775 Hiding under the bed, in the closet.
7448858 7451861 I'm just saying I got to find a way<br />to get rid of that shadow, Mama.
7451945 7454197 You just like him.<br />You got him in you good.
7454280 7455448 Don't tell me that, Mama.
7455531 7459202 - You Troy Maxson all over again.<br />- I don't want to be Troy Maxson!
7460536 7462121 I just want to be me.
7462205 7465124 You can't be nobody<br />but who you are, Cory.
7465208 7468294 That shadow wasn't nothing<br />but you growing into yourself.
7468461 7470421 You either got to grow into it,<br />or cut it down to fit you,
7470505 7472799 but that's all you got to make a life with.
7472882 7476886 That's all you got to measure yourself<br />against the world out there.
7477887 7480807 Your daddy wanted you<br />to be everything he wasn't,
7480890 7482392 and at the same time,
7482475 7485228 he wanted you to be everything he was.
7485561 7487271 Now, I don't know<br />if he was right or wrong,
7487355 7488481 but I do know
7488564 7491567 he meant to do more good<br />than he meant to do harm.
7493569 7496406 Sometimes, when he touched,<br />he bruised,
7497156 7500451 and sometimes,<br />when he took me in his arms, he cut.
7507250 7509419 When I first met your daddy,
7510336 7511754 I thought,
7512005 7515091 "Here is a man I can lay down with<br />and make a baby."
7518678 7521597 That's the first thing<br />I thought when I seen him.
7521681 7524017 I thought, "Rose Lee,
7524684 7526811 "here's a man<br />you can open yourself up to
7526894 7529063 "and be filled to bursting!
7530606 7535361 "Here's a man that can<br />fill up all them empty spaces
7535445 7538072 "you been tipping around the edges of."
7543369 7546372 When your daddy<br />walked through the house,
7546456 7548124 he was just
7549292 7551627 so big.
7553379 7555048 He filled it up!
7557550 7560386 That was my first mistake.
7560470 7562805 Not to make him<br />leave some room for me.
7567393 7569896 But I wanted a house I could sing in.
7571314 7574567 And that's what your daddy gave me.
7574650 7578738 I didn't know to keep up his strength,<br />I had to give up little pieces of mine.
7580573 7583910 I took on his life as mine<br />and mixed up the pieces,
7583993 7586996 so you couldn't hardly tell<br />which was which.
7589832 7593002 It was my choice. My life.
7593086 7596089 And I didn't have to live it like that,
7598174 7600218 but that's what life offered me<br />in the way of being a woman,
7600301 7601511 and I took it.
7603679 7606516 I grabbed it with both hands.
7606599 7609685 And by the time<br />Raynell came into the house...
7614690 7619028 I didn't want to make my blessings<br />off of nobody's misfortune,
7620863 7623950 but I took on to Raynell like she was
7624033 7627203 all them babies I wanted and never had.
7629455 7632458 Like I'd been blessed<br />to relive a part of my life.
7635545 7638714 And if the Lord see fit<br />to keep up my strength,
7640800 7644804 I'm gonna do her exactly<br />how your daddy did you.
7648391 7651144 I'm gonna give her<br />the best of what's in me.
7661154 7662155 Mama!
7662321 7664407 Reverend Tolliver on the phone.
7682175 7683176 Hi.

7719629 7721380 <i>From that you know<br />Blue was a good old dog</i>
7721464 7723799 <i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>
7724550 7727303 <i>Blue treed a possum<br />Out on a limb</i>

7729972 7732391 <i>Grabbed that possum<br />Put him in a sack</i>
7732475 7734310 <i>Blue stayed there<br />Till I came back</i>
7734810 7737313 <i>Old Blue's feet was<br />Big and round</i>
7737396 7739482 <i>Never let a possum<br />Touch the ground</i>
7740066 7742235 <i>Old Blue died<br />And I dug his grave</i>
7742318 7744737 <i>I dug his grave<br />With a silver spade</i>
