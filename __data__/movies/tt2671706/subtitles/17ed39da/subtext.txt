68160 69536 Troy, you ought to<br />stop that lying.
69560 70959 I ain't lying.
71040 72758 Nigger had a watermelon this big,
72840 74717 talking about,<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"
74800 77473 I'd like to fell out.<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"
77680 79352 And it sitti ng there, big as life.
79440 81556 - What Mr. Rand say?<br />- He ain't said nothing.
81640 84296 He figure, if the nigger was too dumb<br />to know he's carrying a watermelon,
84320 86117 he wasn't going to get<br />much sense out of him.
86200 88998 Trying to hide that great, big,<br />old watermelon under his coat.
89080 91594 Afraid to let the white man<br />see him carry it home.
92040 94474 I'm like you.<br />I ain't got no time for them kinda people.
94560 96073 Now, what he look like getting mad
96200 98216 'cause he seen the man from the union<br />talking to Mr. Rand?
98240 101471 He come up to me, talking about<br />"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."
101560 103755 I told him, "Get away from me with that."
103840 106308 He walked away from me<br />calling you a troublemaker.
106680 108352 What Mr. Rand say?
108440 110112 He ain't said nothing.<br />Told me to go down
110200 112040 to the Commissioner's office<br />next Friday. Whoa!
112360 113776 They called me down there to see them.
113800 116030 Well, as long as<br />you got your complaint filed,
116120 117189 they can't fire you.
117280 118696 That's what one of them<br />white fellas tell me.
118720 119976 I ain't worried about them firing me.
120000 122275 What, they gonna fire me<br />'cause I asked a question?
122360 123429 That's all I did.
123560 125596 I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.
125680 126680 I asked him, "Why?
126760 129016 "Why you got all the white mens<br />driving, and the colored lifting?"
129040 130951 Told him, "What's the matter?<br />Don't I count?
131040 133096 "Think only white fellows<br />got sense enough to drive a truck?"
133120 135401 "Hell, that ain't no paper job.<br />Anybody can drive a truck.
135480 138080 "How come you got all the whites driving<br />and the colored lifting?"
140400 141776 He told me, "Take it to the union."
141800 143074 Well, hell, that's what I done.
143160 145310 Now they want to come up<br />with this pack of lies.
145400 147834 I told Brownie if the man<br />come and ask him any questions,
147960 149234 just tell the truth.
149320 151136 Ain't nothing but somebody<br />trumped it up on you
151160 152336 'cause you filed a complaint on.
152360 153696 Brownie ain't got that much sense.
153720 154976 Man wasn't thinking about nothing.
155000 156896 All I want them to do<br />is change the job description,
156920 159115 give everybody a chance<br />to drive the truck. Oi!
160560 163233 Brownie can't see that.<br />He ain't got that much sense.
184400 185719 How you figure he be making out
185800 188234 with that gal,<br />be up in Taylors' all the time?
188320 190038 - That Alberta gal?<br />- Who?
190120 191439 Brownie.
191520 193909 Same as you and me,<br />getting about as much as we is.
194000 196468 - Which is to say nothing.<br />- It is, huh?
196560 199074 Well, I figure<br />you doing a little better than me.
199160 200718 And I ain't saying what I'm doing!
200800 202677 Nigger, look here. I know you.
202760 204716 If you had gotten anywhere<br />near that gal,
204800 207030 20 minutes later,<br />you'd be looking to tell somebody.
207120 208576 And the first one you gonna want to tell,
208600 210556 that you gonna want to brag to<br />is going to be me.
210640 211755 Oh, I ain't saying that.
213120 215156 I see where you be eyeing her.
215240 217629 I eye all the women.<br />I don't miss nothing.
217720 219976 Don't never let nobody tell you<br />Troy Maxson don't eye the women.
220000 221376 Hey, you been doing<br />more than eyeing her.
221400 222656 You done bought her a drink or two.
222680 224056 Hell, yeah,<br />I bought her a drink. What that mean?
224080 225336 I bought you one, too.
225360 226998 What that mean,<br />'cause I buy her a drink?
227120 228155 I'm just being polite.
228240 229536 It's all right to buy her one drink.
229560 231278 That's what you call being polite.
231360 233080 But when you want to be<br />buying two or three,
233160 234559 that's what you call eyeing her.
234640 236312 Look here. As long as you've known me,
236400 238277 you ever known me<br />to chase after women?
238360 240635 Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.
240760 242136 You're forgetting, I knew you when.
242160 244151 I'm talking about<br />since I been married to Rose.
244240 246390 Oh... Not since you<br />been married to Rose.
246480 248056 That's the truth, though.<br />I can say that.
248080 249672 All right then. Case closed.
250320 253039 I see you be walking up<br />around Alberta's house.
253120 255918 You supposed to be at Taylors',<br />and you be walking up around there.
256000 257136 What you watching<br />where I'm walking for?
257160 258360 I don't be watching after you.
258400 260376 No, I seen you<br />walking around there more than once.
260400 261816 Hell, you liable<br />to see me walking anywhere.
261840 263856 That don't mean nothing 'cause<br />you seen me walking around there.
263880 265176 Where'd she<br />come from, anyway?
265200 266496 She just kinda showed up one day.
266520 269830 Tallahassee. You can look at that<br />and tell she one of them Florida gals.
269920 272150 They got some big,<br />healthy women down there.
272240 274071 Grow them right up out of the ground.
274160 275718 She got a little bit of Indian in her.
275800 277736 Most of them niggers in Florida<br />got some Indian in them.
277760 279796 Yeah, I don't know<br />about that Indian part,
279880 282838 but she damn sure big and healthy.
282920 284956 Woman wears some big stockings.
285040 289192 Got them crazy big legs,<br />and hips wide as the Mississippi River.
289280 290759 Legs don't mean nothing.
290840 292536 You don't do nothing<br />but push 'em out of the way.
292560 294118 But them hips,
294200 297158 - they cushion the ride.<br />- Troy, you ain't got no sense!
297240 300232 It's the truth.<br />Like you riding on Goodyears!
303400 305356 What you all out here getting into?
305440 307715 What you worried about<br />what we getting into for, woman?
307800 308835 This is men talk.
308920 310296 What I care<br />what you all are talking about?
310320 311673 Bono, you gonna stay for supper?
311760 313079 No, thank you, Rose,
313160 315435 but Lucille say<br />she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.
315520 317556 Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.
317640 319995 I might even stay the night,<br />you got some pigfeet.
320080 321936 You got something in there<br />to top them pigfeet, Rose?
321960 324256 I'm cooking up some chicken.<br />I got some chicken and collard greens.
324280 325536 Well, you go on back in the house.
325560 326936 Let me and Bono<br />finish what we talking about.
326960 329679 This is men talk.<br />I got some talk for you later.
329760 331751 And you know<br />what kind of talk I mean, too.
331840 333319 You go on in there and powder it up.
333400 334799 Troy, stop it!
336320 337673 Oh, woman, come here.
337920 341151 Oh! Look here, Bono.
341240 343674 When I first met this woman,
343760 345557 I got out that place.
345640 348598 Hitch up my pony<br />Saddle up my mare
348680 351319 There's a woman out there<br />for me somewhere
351400 354233 I looked at here, looked at there,<br />saw Rose, and I latched on to her.
355400 357277 I latched on to her and I told her...
357360 358793 Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.
359080 363358 I latched on to her and told her,<br />"Baby, I don't want to marry.
363440 365078 "I just want to be your man."
365160 367594 Rose told me...<br />Tell him what you told me, Ro.
367720 369517 I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,
369600 371896 then move out of the way,<br />so the marrying kind could find me.
371920 374354 That's what she told me,<br />"Nigger, you in my way.
374440 375759 "You blocking the view.
375840 377796 "Move out the way,<br />so I can find me a husband."
377880 380314 - I thought it over 2-3 days.<br />- Two-three days, nothing.
380440 381873 You was back the same night.
381960 384110 I come back, told her, "Okay, baby,
384200 385997 "but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster
386080 387718 "and put him out there in the backyard.
387800 389233 "And when he see a stranger come,
389320 390720 "he gonna flap his wings and crow."
390800 392936 Look here, Bono.<br />I done watched that front door by myself.
392960 395713 It was that<br />back door I was worried about.
395800 398234 Don't talk like that!<br />Troy, you're not but telling a lie.
398560 402633 Only thing was, we first got married,<br />forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.
402720 403869 I hear you tell it.
403960 406349 Me and Lucille was staying<br />down there on Logan Street.
406440 408908 Had two rooms<br />with the outhouse in the back.
409000 410592 I ain't mind the outhouse none.
410720 413188 But when that goddamn<br />wind blew through there in the winter,
413280 414998 that's what I'm talking about!
415320 416680 To this day, I wonder why the hell
416760 419194 I ever stayed down there<br />for six long years.
419280 421040 But, see, I didn't know<br />I could do no better.
421840 424559 I thought only white folks<br />had inside toilets and things.
424640 425834 A lot of folks don't think
425920 427536 they can do no better<br />than they're doing now.
427560 430677 Just something you gotta learn.<br />A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.
430760 432416 Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.<br />She got fresh food.
432440 434336 I ain't said nothing about<br />if she got fresh food.
434360 435720 I'm talking about what she charge.
435760 437637 She charges 10 cents<br />more than the A&P.
437720 439278 A&P ain't never done nothing for me.
439360 441191 I spend my money<br />where I'm treated right.
441280 442599 I go down to Bella, say,
442680 445176 "I need a loaf of bread,<br />I'll pay you Friday," she gives it to me.
445200 447031 What sense that make<br />when I got money
447120 448439 to spend it somewhere else
448520 450176 and ignore the person<br />who done right by me?
450200 451235 That ain't in the Bible.
451320 452696 We ain't talking about<br />what's in the Bible.
452720 454870 What sense it make to shop there<br />when she overcharges?
454960 456536 Well, you do your shopping<br />where you want to,
456560 458136 I do my shopping<br />where people been good to me.
458160 460176 Oh, I don't think it's right for<br />her to overcharge, that's all.
460200 461456 Look here, I got to be getting on.
461480 462976 Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.
463000 464616 Where you going, nigger?<br />We ain't finished this pint.
464640 465755 Come here finish this pint.
465920 468480 Well, hell, I am,<br />if you ever turn the bottle loose.
469880 474237 Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,<br />I'm glad Cory got that job down there.
474520 476176 Help him with<br />his school clothes and things.
476200 478509 Gabe done moved out,<br />things getting tight around here.
478600 479828 He got that job,
479920 481478 he can start to look out for himself.
481560 484791 Cory done got recruited<br />by a college football team.
484920 488037 I told that boy about<br />that college football stuff.
488120 490918 The white man ain't gonna<br />let him get nowhere with that football.
491000 492991 I told him<br />when he first come to me with it.
493080 495674 Now, you come telling me<br />he done got more tied up in it.
495760 497830 He ought to get recruited<br />in how to fix cars,
497920 499216 or some way he can make a living.
499240 501629 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
501720 503711 It's just something<br />the boys in school do.
503800 505976 They're gonna send a recruiter by<br />to talk to you. He'll tell you.
506000 508056 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
508080 509593 It's an honor to be recruited.
509680 512114 It ain't gonna get him nowhere,<br />Bono'll tell you that.
512440 515477 If he be like you in sports,<br />he gonna be all right.
515560 518028 Ain't but two men<br />ever played baseball good as you.
518160 520196 That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.
520280 522440 Them the only two men ever<br />hit more home runs than you.
522520 524795 And what it ever get me?<br />I ain't got a pot to piss in,
524920 526194 or a window to throw it out of.
526280 528096 Times have changed since<br />you were playing baseball, Troy.
528120 530216 That was before the war.<br />Times have changed a lot since then.
530240 531376 How the hell they done changed?
531400 532976 They got a lot of colored boys<br />playing ball now.
533000 534353 Baseball and football.
534440 537477 You right about that, Ro.<br />Times have changed, Troy.
537560 538913 You just come along too early.
539000 542675 There ought not never<br />have been no time called "too early."
544200 546430 Now you take that fellow...
546520 549256 What's that fellow they had playing<br />right field back then for the Yankees?
549280 550416 You remember<br />who I'm talking about, Bono,
550440 551456 played right field for The Yankees.
551480 553118 - Selkirk?<br />- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!
553240 556550 Man's batting 269,<br />you understand? 269!
556640 560349 What sense that make?<br />I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!
560440 563432 He's batting 269,<br />playing right field for the Yankees!
563520 565636 I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.
565720 568393 She's running around<br />with raggedy shoes on her feet.
568480 570096 I bet you<br />Selkirk's daughter ain't running around
570120 571976 with no raggedy shoes on her feet.<br />I bet you that.
572000 573840 They got a lot of<br />colored baseball players now.
573920 575120 Jackie Robinson was the first.
575160 576680 Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.
576720 579917 I done seen 100 niggers play baseball<br />better than Jackie Robinson.
580000 582912 Hell, I seen some teams<br />Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!
583000 584336 What you talking about,<br />Jackie Robinson?
584360 586032 Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!
586120 588976 I'm talking about if you could play ball,<br />then they ought to let you play.
589000 590256 Don't matter what color you are.
590280 591918 Telling me I come along too early.
592000 595276 If you can play,<br />then they ought to let you play.
595360 596720 You gonna drink yourself to death.
596760 598716 You don't need to be drinking like that.
598800 601758 Oh! Death ain't nothing.<br />I done seen him,
601840 604216 I done wrestled with him.<br />You can't tell me nothing about death.
604240 607516 Death ain't nothing<br />but a fastball on the outside corner,
607600 609477 and you know what I do with that.
609560 611437 Look here, Bono, am I lying?
611520 614353 You get one of them fastballs<br />about waist high
614440 616032 on the outside corner of the plate
616120 617840 where you can get<br />the meat of the bat on it,
617920 621151 and, good God,<br />you could kiss it good-bye.
621240 623196 - Am I lying?<br />- No, you telling the truth.
623360 624793 I seen you do it.
624880 630000 If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.<br />That's all death is to me.
630080 632514 A fastball on the outside corner.
632600 634909 I don't know why you want to<br />get on talking about death?
635000 636376 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with talking about death.
636400 638118 That's a part of life!<br />Everybody gonna die.
638240 639514 You gonna die. I'm gonna die.
639600 641397 Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.
641480 643896 But you ain't got to talk about it.<br />I don't like talking about it.
643920 645176 Well, you the one brought it up.
645200 646758 Me and Bono talking about baseball.
646840 648856 You come telling me<br />I'm gonna drink myself to death.
648880 650154 Ain't that right, Bono?
650240 652470 Now you know I drink just<br />but one night out the week,
652560 653709 that's Friday night.
653840 655576 I drink just enough<br />to where I can handle it.
655600 657176 Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.
657200 659336 So, you ain't got to worry<br />about me drinking myself to death
659360 660918 'cause I ain't worrying about death.
661000 663673 I done seen him,<br />done wrestled with him.
663760 665034 Look here, Bono.
665120 668271 I look up one day,<br />and Death is marching straight at me,
668360 670476 like soldiers on parade.
670560 672915 The Army of Death<br />was marching straight at me.
673000 676356 It was the middle of July, 1941.
676440 678670 And it got real cold,<br />just like it be winter.
678760 680352 And it seemed like Death, himself,
680440 682476 reached out<br />and touched me on the shoulder.
682560 685836 He touched me like I touch you now.<br />I got cold as ice.
685920 687256 Death standing there, grinning at me.
687280 688998 Troy, why don't you hush that talk.
689080 692356 I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?<br />You be wanting me?
692440 694317 "You done sent your army<br />to be getting me?"
694400 695416 I looked him dead in the eye.
695440 696509 I wasn't fearing nothing.
696600 699273 I was ready to tangle,<br />just like I'm ready to tangle now!
699640 701517 Bible says be ever vigilant.
701600 703909 So, I don't get but so drunk.<br />I got to keep watch.
704000 705656 Troy was right down there<br />at Mercy Hospital.
705680 707080 You remember he had that pneumonia,
707120 709096 laying there with a fever,<br />talking plumb out his head.
709120 710496 And Death standing there,<br />staring at me,
710520 711919 carrying that sickle in his hand.
712000 717757 Finally, he say, "You want to be<br />bound over for another year?"
717840 719990 Just like that. He say,
720080 723868 "You want to be bound over<br />for another year?"
723960 727953 I said, "Bound over, hell!<br />We can settle this right now."
728080 731470 He kinda fell back when I said that.<br />And all the cold went out of me.
731560 733551 I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.
733760 735432 I threw it as far as I could throw it,
735520 737192 and me and him<br />commenced to wrestling.
737280 740795 We wrestled for... Carry the six...<br />Three days and three nights!
740880 743189 Now, I don't know<br />where I got the strength from,
743280 745056 'cause every time<br />he tried to get the best of me,
745080 749198 I reached way deep down inside myself,<br />found the strength to do him one better.
749280 750872 Every time Troy tells that story,
750960 752256 he find different ways to tell it,
752280 753816 different things to make up.
753840 755239 I ain't making up nothing, woman.
755320 756936 I'm telling you<br />the facts of what happened.
756960 759235 I wrestled with Death<br />for three days and three nights,
759360 761794 and I'm standing here<br />to tell you about it.
764120 766156 All right. At the end of the third night,
766240 769312 we done weakened each other<br />to where we can't even hardly move.
769400 770400 Death stood up.
770480 772761 He threw on that robe,<br />had a white robe with a hood on it.
773800 776136 He throwed on that robe<br />and went off to look for that sickle.
776160 779835 He said, "I'll be back."<br />Just like that. "I'll be back."
779920 783037 I said, "Yeah?<br />Well, you gonna have to find me!"
783120 784235 I wasn't no fool.
784720 786119 I wasn't going looking for him.
786200 788816 I know Death ain't nothing to play with.<br />And I know he's gonna get me.
788840 791877 I know I got to join his army,<br />his camp followers.
791960 794838 But as long as I keep up my strength<br />and see him coming,
794920 797275 as long as I keep up my vigilance,
797400 798799 he gonna have to fight to get me.
798880 800154 I ain't going easy.
800560 804235 Well, look here,<br />since you got to keep up your vigilance,
804320 806231 - let me have the bottle.<br />- Oh!
806320 807816 Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.
807840 809016 I should have left out that part.
809040 810519 Troy be talking all that stuff.
810600 812955 Half the time, he don't even know<br />what he be talking about!
813080 815096 - Yeah, Bono know me better than that.<br />- That's right, I know you.
815120 818317 I know you got some<br />Uncle Remus in your blood.
818400 820675 You got more stories<br />than the devil got sinners.
820760 823354 Oh, hell, I done seen him, too.<br />Done talked to the devil.
823440 825160 Nobody wants to be<br />hearing that stuff!
827960 829154 Hey, Pop.

837360 838793 He must've been doing all right.

840120 841816 Troy, leave your boy alone.<br />He come by to see you
841840 843416 and you want to start all that nonsense.

856160 858016 No, Rose, thanks.<br />I just was in the neighborhood
858040 859496 and thought I'd stop by for a minute.
859520 861056 Yeah, you was<br />in the neighborhood all right.
861080 862416 Nigger, you telling the truth there.
862440 864256 You was in the neighborhood<br />'cause it's my payday.
864280 866510 Well, hell, since you mentioned it,<br />let me have $10.
866680 870355 I'll be damned.<br />I'll die and go to hell
870440 872908 and play blackjack with the devil<br />before I give you $10.
873000 875878 That's what I want to know about,<br />that devil you done seen.
875960 878110 Pop done seen the devil?<br />You too much, Pop.
878200 880430 - Yeah, I done seen him.<br />- He ain't seen no devil.
880520 882696 I told him that man<br />ain't had nothing to do with the devil.
882720 884856 Anything he can't understand,<br />he want to call it the devil.
884880 888077 Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's<br />to get some furniture.
888160 890958 You got three rooms for $298.<br />That what it say on the radio.
891040 894396 "Three rooms, $298."<br />He made up a little song about it.
894480 897472 I get down there,<br />man tell me I can't get no credit.
897560 899790 I'm working every day,<br />can't get no credit.
899880 900995 What to do?
901120 902896 I got an empty house<br />with some raggedy furniture.
902920 904035 Cory ain't got no bed.
904120 906236 He's sleeping on a pile of rags<br />on the floor.
906320 908356 Working every day, can't get no credit.
908440 909840 I come back here, Rose'll tell you,
909920 911880 madder than hell,<br />trying to figure out what to do.
912120 913235 Come a knock on the door.
913320 915440 I ain't been living but three days,<br />who know I'm here?
915480 917596 I open the door.<br />Devil standing there.
917680 918715 Bigger than life.
918800 920680 White fella,<br />got on good clothes and everything.
920760 921976 Standing there<br />with a clipboard in his hand.
922000 923280 Now, I ain't got to say nothing.
923400 924833 First words come out of his mouth,
924920 927753 "I understand you need some furniture<br />and can't get no credit."
927840 931310 I liked to fell over. He said,<br />"I'll give you all the credit you want,
931400 933391 "but you gonna have to pay<br />the interest on it."
933480 934976 Now, I told him,<br />he give me them three rooms,
935000 936479 he can charge whatever he want.
936560 938198 Next day, a truck pull up here,
938280 939918 two men unload them three rooms.
940040 942235 Man what drove the truck<br />give me a book.
942320 945756 Said first of the month,<br />send $10 to the address in the book,
945880 946949 everything'll be fine.
947040 948519 Said if you miss a payment,
948600 951273 the devil was coming back,<br />and there'll be hell to pay.
951360 952873 That was 15 years ago.
952960 956475 To this day, first day of every month,<br />I send my $10,
956600 958016 just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.
958040 959393 Troy lying.

960960 962896 Now, you tell me,<br />who else that gonna be but the devil?
962920 964990 And I ain't sold my soul<br />or nothing like that.
965080 967799 No, I wouldn't have truck with the<br />devil over nothing like that.
967880 971475 But I got my furniture.<br />And I send my $10, just like clockwork.
971560 974438 How long you say<br />you been paying this $10 a month?

979400 980913 Oh, hell, I done paid for it.
981040 982632 I done paid for it 10 times over.
982720 984056 Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.
984080 986514 Troy lying.<br />We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.
986600 988318 He ain't paying<br />no $10 a month to nobody.
988400 990675 Hell, woman,<br />Bono know I ain't that big a fool.
990800 993376 I was just getting ready to say,<br />I know where there's a bridge for sale.
993400 994469 I'll tell you this.
994560 996312 It don't matter to me if it was the devil.
996400 997816 It don't matter if the devil give credit.
997840 999751 - Somebody got to give it.<br />- It ought to matter.
999840 1002176 You walking around here saying<br />you gonna make truck with the devil,
1002200 1003696 God's the one<br />you're gonna have to answer to.

1005320 1007280 Yeah, well, look here, Pop,<br />let me have that $10.
1007360 1008475 I'll give it back to you.

1010080 1011149 Bono, what did I tell you?
1011280 1012896 Only time I see this nigger<br />is when he want something.
1012920 1014160 That's the only time I see him.

1068880 1070029 Gabe done moved out,

1072560 1073816 Things done got tight around here.

1100440 1101589 Life don't owe you nothing.
1101680 1104274 You owe it to yourself.<br />Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.
1104360 1106794 You got your way of<br />dealing with the world, I got mine.

1138080 1140753 You can't change me, Pop.<br />I'm 34 years old.
1141560 1142754 If you wanted to change me,

1145080 1147469 I come by to see you, ask you for $10,
1147560 1150313 and you want to talk about<br />how I was raised?

1166200 1169112 Hell you looking at?<br />You know I ain't got no money.
1169200 1171031 You know what I do with my money.

1237240 1241279 I love her so much,<br />I done run out of ways of loving her,
1241360 1243590 so, I got to get back to basics.

1323320 1325629 Seems like those that need the least<br />always get lucky.

1327000 1328319 Them numbers don't know nobody.
1328400 1330560 I don't know why you fool with 'em,<br />you and Lyons both.
1330680 1332159 Oh, it's something to do.
1332240 1334515 You ain't doing nothing<br />but throwing your money away.
1334600 1336158 Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.
1336240 1337896 I just play a nickel here<br />and a nickel there.
1337920 1339496 That's two nickels<br />you done throwed away.
1339520 1342159 Nah, I hit sometimes.<br />That makes up for it.
1342240 1343753 Always comes in handy when I do hit.
1343840 1345056 I don't hear you complaining then.
1345080 1347000 I ain't complaining now.<br />I just say it's foolish,
1347040 1350191 trying to guess out of 600 ways<br />which way the number gonna come.
1350280 1351840 If I had all the money these niggers...
1355520 1359433 You negroes throw away<br />on numbers in one week,
1359520 1362353 just one week, I'd be a rich man.
1362440 1363919 You wishing and calling it foolish
1364000 1365656 ain't gonna stop folks<br />from playing the numbers.
1365680 1367716 That's one thing for sure.
1367800 1370951 Besides, some good things<br />come from playing numbers.
1371040 1373998 Look where Pope done bought him<br />that restaurant off of numbers.
1374080 1376514 I can't stand niggers like that.
1376600 1378716 Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.
1378800 1381519 He running around with his shoes<br />all run-over,
1381600 1383591 bumming money for cigarettes.
1383680 1386592 All right.<br />Got lucky there, hit the numbers...
1386680 1388080 Troy, I know all about it.
1388120 1389496 Had good sense.<br />I'll say that for him.
1389520 1390873 Man ain't throw his money away.
1390960 1394794 I done see niggers go through<br />$2,000 in four days.
1394880 1397394 Man built him that restaurant<br />down there.
1397480 1398993 Fix it up real nice, too.
1399080 1400957 Then he won't let nobody come in it.
1401040 1403349 Negro go in there,<br />can't get no kind of service.
1403440 1406716 Seen a white fella go in there,<br />he orders a bowl of stew.
1406840 1409070 Pope pick all the meat<br />out of the pot for him.
1409160 1411116 Man ain't had nothing<br />but a bowl of meat!
1411200 1412679 Negro go in there behind him,
1412760 1414776 he ain't got nothing<br />but the potatoes and the carrots.
1414800 1416916 Talking about<br />what numbers do for people.
1417000 1418296 You picked the wrong example there.
1418320 1420390 Ain't done nothing<br />but made a worser fool out of him
1420520 1422272 than he already was before.
1424160 1425434 Troy.
1425520 1428751 You ought to stop worrying about<br />what happened at work yesterday.
1431040 1432359 I ain't worried.
1433920 1436000 Just called me down there,<br />the Commissioner's office,
1436120 1438759 everybody's worried<br />about them firing me.
1438840 1441718 I ain't worrying about them firing me.
1441800 1444030 You ain't got to worry about that.
1444120 1446270 Where's Cory? Cory in the house?
1449680 1451830 - Cory!<br />- He gone out.
1451920 1453672 Out, huh? Yeah, he going out
1453760 1456638 'cause he know<br />I want him to work on this fence.
1456720 1458631 I know how he is.<br />That boy is scared of working.
1458720 1460056 He ain't done a lick of work in his life.
1460080 1461559 He had to go to football practice.
1461640 1463640 Coach wanted them<br />to get in a little extra practice
1463720 1464994 before the season start.
1465080 1466752 Oh, yeah, I got his practice all right.
1466840 1469115 Running out of here<br />before he gets his chores done.
1469200 1470840 Troy, what is wrong with you<br />this morning?
1470880 1472056 Don't nothing set right with you.
1472080 1474480 Go on back in there, go to bed,<br />and get up on the other side.
1474520 1475856 Why something got to be<br />wrong with me?
1475880 1477016 I ain't said nothing wrong with me.
1477040 1478576 Well, you got something to say<br />about everything.
1478600 1480416 First, it's the numbers,<br />then it's the way the man
1480440 1482271 run his restaurant,<br />then you done got on Cory.
1482360 1483873 What's it gonna be next?
1484000 1486150 Take a look up there,<br />see if the weather suit you.
1486240 1487816 Or is it gonna be<br />how you gonna put up this fence
1487840 1489176 with the clothes hanging in the yard?
1489200 1490792 You hit the nail on the head then.
1490880 1492950 I know you like I know<br />the back of my hand.

1576960 1579076 Troy mad at me.

1581880 1583016 You ain't done nothing to me.
1583040 1585713 I just move over to Miss Pearl's
1585800 1587472 to keep out from in your way.
1587560 1588788 I ain't mean no harm by it.
1588880 1590393 Who said anything about that?
1590480 1591993 I ain't said nothing about that.
1593120 1594872 You ain't mad at me, is you?
1594960 1599556 I ain't made at you, Gabe.<br />If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.
1599640 1602029 Come on, get on out of the street.<br />Come on.
1606080 1609709 I got me two rooms in the basement.<br />I got my own door, too.

1613920 1617515 That's my own key.<br />Ain't nobody else got a key like that.
1617600 1619431 That's my key for my two rooms.
1619520 1621476 That's good, Gabe.<br />Got your own key, that's good.
1621560 1622754 You hungry, Gabe?
1622840 1624576 I was just fixing to cook Troy<br />some breakfast.
1624600 1625749 I'll take some biscuits.
1625840 1627400 - Ooh, you got some biscuits?<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1629200 1631077 Did you know, when I was in Heaven,
1631160 1633071 every morning, me and Saint Peter
1633160 1636994 would sit down by the Gate<br />and eat some big, fat biscuits?
1637080 1639116 Oh, yeah, we had us a good time.
1639240 1641470 We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.
1641560 1644154 And then Saint Peter<br />would go off to sleep,
1644240 1645832 and tell me to wake him up
1645920 1648195 when it's time to open the Gates<br />for the Judgment.
1648280 1652751 Well, come on,<br />I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.
1652880 1656793 Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name<br />in his book. I seen it.
1656880 1658757 It say, "Troy Maxson."
1659040 1660917 I say, "I know him.
1661000 1664310 "He got the same name like what I got.
1664400 1666356 "That's my brother."
1667760 1670069 How many times<br />you gonna tell me that, Gabe?
1670160 1673197 Ain't got my name in the book.<br />Don't have to have my name.
1673280 1675510 I done died and went to Heaven.
1675600 1678592 But he got your name, though.
1678680 1681990 One morning,<br />Saint Peter was looking at his book,
1682080 1684753 and he was marking it up<br />for the Judgment,
1684840 1686876 and he let me see your name.
1686960 1689793 He got it in there under "M."
1689880 1691836 He got Rose's name.
1691960 1695270 I ain't seen it like I seen yours,<br />but I know it's in there.
1695600 1698956 He got a great big book! Whoo!
1699040 1701713 He got everybody's name<br />what was ever been born.
1701800 1703074 That's what he told me.
1703800 1706997 But I seen your name.<br />I seen it with my own eye.
1707080 1708080 Come in the house.

1730800 1732677 Got me two quarters. Want to see?
1733480 1735471 I'm gonna save 'em<br />and buy me a new horn,
1735560 1740315 so Saint Peter can hear me<br />when it's time to open the Gate.
1740480 1741913 You hear that?
1744320 1747039 You hear that?<br />That's the hellhound.
1747120 1748792 I'm gonna chase them out of here.
1748880 1752714 Go on! Get out of here!<br />Get out! Get out!
1752920 1754592 Ouch! Ouch!
1755960 1758076 All you hypocrite members
1758560 1760471 Wasting your time away
1760800 1763394 My God is calling<br />for a workman
1763720 1765631 You had better obey
1766200 1768998 Better get ready<br />for the Judgment
1769480 1772472 Better get ready<br />for the Judgment morning
1773000 1775719 Better get ready for Judgment
1776320 1779153 My God is coming down
1781840 1784832 Better get ready<br />for the Judgment
1785960 1788872 Better get ready<br />for the Judgment morning
1789160 1791993 Better get ready<br />for the Judgment
1792280 1794953 My God is coming down

1799480 1802552 Better get ready<br />for the Judgment
1810760 1812716 Where's Gabe?
1812800 1814711 He's gone off somewhere.
1817360 1818475 He ain't eating right.
1818560 1820516 Miss Pearl say<br />she can't get him to eat nothing.
1820600 1821936 What you want me to do about it, Rose?
1821960 1825396 I did everything I could for the man.<br />I can't make him get well.
1825480 1828677 Man got half his head blown off,<br />what you expect?
1828760 1830496 Seems like something ought to be done<br />to help him.
1830520 1831839 The man don't bother nobody.
1831920 1834275 He just mixed up<br />'cause of that metal plate
1834360 1837033 he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...
1837120 1840157 Thank you. Ain't no sense<br />in sending him to the hospital.
1840240 1841559 At least he'd be eating right.
1841640 1843096 They could help him<br />take care of himself.
1843120 1844712 Don't nobody<br />want to be locked up, Rose.
1844800 1846677 What you want to lock the man up for?
1846760 1848398 Man going down there,
1848480 1852678 over there and fight that war,<br />messing with them Japs,
1852760 1854432 getting half his head blown off.
1854520 1858229 They give him a lousy $3,000.<br />I got to swoop down on that.
1858320 1859696 Is you fixing to get into that again?
1859720 1861756 He got a metal plate in his head.
1861880 1863916 That's the only reason<br />I got a roof over my head
1864000 1865513 is 'cause of that metal plate.
1865600 1867496 Ain't no sense<br />in you blaming yourself for nothing.
1867520 1869715 Gabe was in no condition<br />to manage that money.
1869800 1870976 You done what was right by him.
1871000 1873096 Can't nobody say<br />you ain't done what was right by him.
1873120 1874520 Look how long you took care of him.
1874600 1877200 Till he wanted his own place<br />and moved over there with Miss Pearl.
1877280 1879794 That ain't what I'm saying, woman.<br />I'm just...
1882400 1883833 I'm just stating the facts.
1883920 1885990 If my brother<br />didn't have a metal plate in his head,
1886080 1887513 I wouldn't have a pot to piss in
1887600 1888999 or a window to throw it out of.
1889080 1890798 And I'm 53...
1900800 1902358 Where you going off to?
1902440 1904176 You been running out of here<br />every Saturday for weeks.

2024280 2025856 What do I care about the game?<br />Come here, woman.
2025880 2027096 I thought you went down to Taylors'
2027120 2028872 to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

2149320 2152437 See, now snow come this winter,<br />sit up on that roof like it is,
2152520 2154520 it's gonna seep inside,<br />just gonna be a little bit,
2154560 2155736 you ain't gonna hardly notice it,
2155760 2156875 then next thing you know,
2156960 2158496 it's gonna be leaking all over the house.
2158520 2160476 Then the wood rot from all that water,
2160560 2162471 and you gonna need a whole new roof.
2162560 2164755 Now how much you think it cost<br />to get that roof fixed?
2165120 2169079 - I don't know.<br />- $264 cash money. See?
2169160 2170878 While you be thinking about a TV,
2170960 2172473 I got to be thinking about the roof
2172560 2175120 or whatever else go wrong around here.
2175200 2177111 Now if you had $200,<br />what would you do?
2177200 2179589 Fix the roof, or buy a TV?
2179680 2182069 I'd buy a TV.<br />And when the roof started to leak,
2182200 2183480 if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.
2183560 2184976 Where you gonna get your money from?
2185000 2186319 You done spent it on a TV.
2186400 2187469 You gonna sit up in there,
2187560 2189790 let that water run all over<br />your brand-new TV?
2189880 2191438 Pop, you got the money. I know you do.
2191520 2193238 - Where I got it at, huh?<br />- In the bank.
2193320 2194594 You want to see my bank book?
2194680 2197478 You want to see that $73.22<br />I got sitting up in there?
2197560 2199296 You don't have to pay for it<br />all at one time.
2199320 2201256 You can put a down payment on it,<br />and carry it on with you.
2201280 2203953 Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing<br />if I can help it.
2204040 2206600 Miss a payment, they come<br />and snatch it right out of your house.
2206680 2209717 Then what you got, huh? See?
2209800 2213315 Now, when I get $200 clear,<br />I'll buy me a TV.
2213440 2216796 Right now, when I get $264,<br />I'm gonna get that roof fixed.
2216880 2217880 Oh, Pop...
2217960 2220679 You go get you $200<br />and buy you a TV if you want to.
2220760 2222360 I got better things to do with my money.
2222440 2224670 I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.
2225080 2226308 All right, I'll tell you what.
2226400 2229597 You get $100,<br />I'll put the other $100 with it.
2229680 2231159 All right, I'm gonna show you.
2231240 2234471 Yeah, show me how you can<br />cut these boards right now.
2235200 2237634 There you go. That's $200 worth.
2240400 2242152 - The Pirates won today.<br />- Yeah?
2242240 2243355 That makes five in a row.
2243440 2244616 I ain't thinking about no Pirates.
2244640 2245868 They got an all-white team.
2245960 2249635 Got that boy, though, that Puerto Rican<br />boy, Clemente?
2249960 2251029 Don't even half play him.
2251120 2253320 That boy could be something<br />if they'd give him a chance.
2253360 2255240 Play him one day,<br />sit him on the bench the next.
2255320 2256600 He gets lots of chances to play.
2256640 2258496 I'm talking about playing every day,<br />playing regular,
2258520 2260296 so you can get your timing,<br />that's what I'm talking about.
2260320 2262456 They got some white guys on the team<br />that don't play every day.
2262480 2263776 You can't play everybody<br />at the same time.
2263800 2265656 If they got a white fellow<br />sitting on the bench,
2265680 2268319 you can bet your last dollar<br />he can't play.
2268400 2270496 Colored guy got to be twice as good<br />to get on the team.
2270520 2273318 That's why I don't want you<br />getting all tied up in them sports.
2273400 2275436 Man on the team, what it get him?
2275520 2277476 Got colored on the team,<br />don't even use him.
2277560 2280313 Same as not having them.<br />All them teams the same.
2280400 2282675 The Braves got Hank Aaron<br />and Wes Covington.
2282800 2284791 Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.<br />That makes 43.
2284880 2286880 Aaron ain't nobody.<br />That's what you supposed to do.
2286920 2288717 That's how<br />the game's supposed to be played.
2288800 2291616 Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of<br />getting your timing and follow through.
2291640 2293756 Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.
2293840 2295376 Not off no major-league pitcher,<br />you couldn't.
2295400 2297016 We had better pitching<br />in the Negro leagues.
2297040 2298792 I hit seven home runs<br />off of Satchel Paige.
2298880 2300176 You can't get no better than that.
2300200 2301936 Sandy Koufax,<br />he leading the league in strikeouts.
2301960 2303520 I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.
2303560 2305376 You got Warren Spahn<br />and Lew Burdette. I bet you...
2305400 2306628 I'm through with it now.
2310880 2313269 Go and cut them boards.
2315400 2318676 Your mama told me you got recruited<br />by a college football team.
2318760 2320079 Is that right?
2320280 2323511 Yeah, Coach Zellman say the recruiter<br />gonna be coming by to talk to you.
2323600 2325636 Get you to sign the permission papers.
2325760 2327376 I thought you was supposed to<br />be working down the A&P.
2327400 2329096 Ain't you supposed to be<br />working down there after school?
2329120 2330872 Mr. Stawicki say<br />he gonna hold my job for me
2330960 2332359 until after the football season.
2332640 2335029 He said starting next week,<br />I can work weekends.
2335120 2338032 Boy, I thought we had an understanding<br />about this football stuff.
2338120 2339838 You supposed to keep up<br />with your chores,
2339920 2341717 hold your job down there at the A&P.
2341800 2343995 You ain't been around here all day<br />on a Saturday,
2344080 2345354 ain't none of your chores done.
2345440 2347216 Now you come telling me<br />you done quit your job?
2347240 2349336 - I'm gonna be working weekends.<br />- You damn right you are!
2349360 2351256 And ain't no need for nobody<br />to be coming around here,
2351280 2352496 talking to me about signing nothing.
2352520 2353555 Pop, you can't do that.
2353640 2355016 He's coming all the way<br />from North Carolina.
2355040 2356871 I don't care where he coming from!
2357000 2358149 Look, boy,
2359280 2362556 the white man ain't gonna let you<br />get nowhere with no football no way.
2362960 2365155 Now you get your book-learning,<br />so you can, uh,
2365280 2368192 work your way up at the A&P<br />and learn how to fix cars,
2368280 2369952 or build houses, get you a trade.
2370040 2372554 This way, you got something<br />can't nobody take away from you.
2372680 2375069 You go in and learn<br />how to put your hands to good use
2375160 2377037 besides hauling other people's garbage.
2377120 2378189 I get good grades, Pop.
2378280 2379696 That's why the recruiter<br />want to talk with you.
2379720 2381336 You got to keep up<br />your grades to get recruited.
2381360 2383256 This way, I'll be going to college,<br />I'll get a chance.
2383280 2386750 First, you get your butt down there<br />and get your job back.
2386840 2388336 Mr. Stawicki done already<br />hired somebody else
2388360 2390000 'cause I told him I was playing football.
2391440 2393271 You a bigger fool than I thought.
2393360 2395351 You gonna let somebody<br />take away your job,
2395440 2396759 so you can play some football.
2397320 2398548 Where you gonna get your money
2398640 2400176 to take care of your girlfriend<br />and whatnot?
2400200 2403078 What kind of foolishness is that<br />to let somebody take away your job?
2403160 2404456 I'm still gonna be working weekends.
2404480 2406616 No. You getting out of here<br />and finding you another job.
2406640 2407914 Come on, Pop. I gotta practice.
2408000 2409816 I can't work after school<br />and play football, too.
2409840 2411456 The team needs me,<br />that's what Coach Zellman say.
2411480 2413696 I don't care what nobody say.<br />I'm the boss. You understand?
2413720 2416951 I'm the boss around here.<br />I do the only saying what counts.
2417040 2419429 - Come on...<br />- I asked you, "Do you understand?"
2419560 2422438 - Yeah.<br />- What?
2422520 2425671 - Yes, sir.<br />- All right.
2425760 2427557 You get on down there to that A&P
2427640 2428856 and see if you can get your job back.
2428880 2431440 If you can't do both,<br />then you quit the football team.
2431520 2433636 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.
2433720 2434914 Yes, sir.
2442520 2443999 Can I ask you a question?
2444080 2445593 What the hell you got to ask me?
2445680 2448478 Mr. Stawicki the one<br />you got the questions for.
2448560 2450039 How come you ain't never liked me?
2451240 2455472 Like you?<br />Who the hell said I got to like you?
2456960 2459110 What law is there say I got to like you?
2459200 2460576 You want to stand up in front of my face
2460600 2462318 and ask a damn fool-ass question<br />like that.
2462400 2463674 Talk about liking somebody.
2463760 2465160 Come here, boy, when I talk to you.
2467440 2471718 Straighten up, God damn it!<br />I asked you a question.
2472000 2474958 - What law is there say I got to like you?<br />- None.
2475040 2477031 All right, then. Don't you eat every day?
2478400 2479833 Answer me when I talk to you.
2479920 2481056 - Don't you eat every day?<br />- Yeah.
2481080 2482752 Nigger, as long as you in my house,
2482840 2484920 you put a "sir" on the end of it<br />when you talk to me.

2486400 2487776 - Got a roof over your head?<br />- Yes, sir.
2487800 2489056 - Got clothes on your back?<br />- Yes, sir.
2489080 2490680 - Why you think that is?<br />- 'Cause of you.
2490720 2492836 Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.
2492920 2495229 But why do you think that is?
2496920 2498239 'Cause you like me?
2498440 2500351 "Like" you.
2500440 2502317 I go out of here every morning,
2502400 2505710 I bust my butt putting up<br />with them crackers every day
2505800 2507518 'cause I "like" you.
2507600 2510637 You about the biggest fool I ever saw.<br />It's my job.
2510720 2512551 It's my responsibility.
2512640 2515438 A man is supposed to<br />take care of his family.
2515640 2518518 You live in my house,<br />fill your belly with my food,
2518600 2522195 put your behind on my bed<br />because you're my son.
2522280 2525078 Not 'cause I like you.<br />'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.
2525160 2527720 I owe a responsibility to you.
2527800 2529680 Now, let's get this straight<br />right here and now,
2529760 2531318 before it go along any further.
2531400 2532879 I ain't got to like you.
2532960 2536077 Mr. Rand don't give me my money<br />come payday 'cause he like me.
2536160 2539197 He give it to me 'cause he owe me.
2539680 2541376 Now I done give you<br />everything I got to give you.
2541400 2543709 I give you your life!
2543800 2545336 Me and your mama<br />worked that out between us,
2545360 2548477 and liking your black ass<br />wasn't part of the bargain.
2548680 2550079 Now don't you go through life
2550160 2552390 worrying about<br />whether somebody like you, or not.
2552480 2555552 You best be making sure<br />they're doing right by you.
2555640 2557336 - You understand what I'm saying?<br />- Yes, sir.
2557360 2560796 Then get the hell out of my face<br />and get on down to that A&P!
2584160 2586594 Why don't you go ahead<br />and let the boy play football, Troy?
2586680 2588591 He just want to be like you<br />with the sports.
2588680 2590750 I don't want him to be like me.
2590840 2593593 I want him to get as far away from my life<br />as he possibly can get.
2593680 2595830 You the only decent thing<br />ever happened to me, Rose.
2596360 2597793 And I wish him that.
2598360 2601511 But I don't wish him<br />nothing else from my life.
2602520 2603873 I decided 17 years ago,
2603960 2606428 that boy wasn't gonna<br />get involved in no sports.
2606520 2608216 Not after what they did to me<br />in the sports.
2608240 2610536 Why don't you just admit<br />you were too old for the major leagues?
2610560 2612160 For once, why don't you just admit that?
2612240 2613912 Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.
2614000 2617231 I just wasn't the right color.<br />Hell, I'm 53 years old,
2617360 2620432 I can do better<br />than Selkirk's.269 right now.
2620520 2622875 How were you gonna play ball<br />when you were over 40?
2622960 2624640 Sometimes, I can't get<br />no sense out of you.
2624720 2625789 I got good sense, woman.
2625880 2629111 I got sense enough not to let that boy<br />get hurt playing no sports.
2629200 2630713 You mothering the boy too much.
2630840 2632956 Worrying about whether<br />people "like" him or not.
2633040 2636316 Everything that boy do, he do for you.
2636400 2638960 He wants you to say,<br />"Good job, son." That's all.
2639400 2642517 I ain't got time for that, Rose.<br />He's alive, he's healthy.
2642600 2645956 He's got to make his own way.<br />I made mine.
2646080 2648656 Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand<br />when he get out there in the world.
2648680 2651035 Times have changed, Troy.
2651120 2653190 People change.
2653280 2655555 The world changing,<br />and you can't even see it.
2657600 2658874 Huh.
2662080 2664833 Woman, I do the best I can do.
2664920 2666239 I come in here every Friday,
2666320 2669153 I carry a sack of potatoes<br />and a bucket of lard.
2669240 2672835 You all line up at the door<br />with your hands out.
2672920 2674672 I give you the lint from my pockets.
2674760 2676512 I give you my sweat and my blood.
2676600 2679194 I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.
2679320 2681914 We go upstairs in that room at night,<br />I fall down on you
2682000 2685515 and try to blast a hole into forever.
2685600 2687830 I get up Monday morning,<br />find my lunch on the table,
2687920 2689319 go out and make my way.
2689400 2693678 Find my strength<br />to get me through to next Friday.
2693760 2695159 That's all I got, Rose.
2698280 2701078 That's all I got to give.
2705280 2706793 Can't give nothing else!
2733720 2734994 Mr. Maxson?
2737920 2740115 Commissioner will see you now.
2746920 2748273 Rose!

2752920 2757311 I wish I could've seen<br />Mr. Rand's face when he told you.
2757440 2758976 He couldn't get it out his mouth.
2759000 2760194 Liked to bit his tongue.
2760280 2762296 When they called me down there<br />to the Commissioner's office,
2762320 2765073 he thought they was gonna fire me,<br />like everybody else.
2765160 2766856 Oh, I didn't think they was gonna fire you.
2766880 2769348 I thought they's gonna put you<br />on the warning paper.
2769440 2772750 Hey, Rose!<br />Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.
2772840 2774876 I see you run right<br />down there to Taylors'
2775000 2776274 and told that Alberta gal.
2776360 2779432 Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!
2779520 2781431 I went down there to cash my check.
2782320 2783355 Hey!
2783440 2785237 Hush all that hollering.<br />I know you out here.
2785320 2787176 What they say down<br />at the Commissioner's office?
2787200 2788997 You supposed to come<br />when I call you, woman.
2789080 2790229 Bono will tell you that.
2790320 2791833 Don't Lucille come when you call her?
2791920 2793096 Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

2796160 2797229 get uppity like that.
2797320 2799880 You say, "Come here, Blue,"<br />he just lay there, look at you.
2799960 2802296 End up getting a stick chasin' him away,<br />trying to make him come.
2802320 2803799 I ain't studying you and your dog.
2803880 2805520 I remember you used to<br />sing that old song.
2805720 2807870 Hear it ring!<br />Hear it ring!
2808080 2809752 Had an old dog<br />His name was Blue
2809840 2811717 Nobody wants to hear that old song.
2812320 2814072 You know Blue was mighty true
2814160 2816296 Used to have Cory<br />runnin' around here singin' that song.
2816320 2817992 Hell, I remember that song myself.
2818080 2820435 You know Blue<br />Was a good old dog
2820640 2822835 Blue treed a possum<br />In a hollow log
2823000 2825514 That's my daddy's song.<br />My daddy made up that song.
2825600 2828240 I don't care who made it up.<br />Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.
2828480 2829833 Come here, woman!

2833720 2835736 What they say down there<br />at the Commissioner's office?
2835760 2838797 Look here, Rose.<br />Mr. Rand called me in his office
2838880 2841394 after I got back from<br />talkin' to them people down there.
2841480 2843789 He called me in his office<br />and told me...
2845520 2846873 They was making me a driver!
2846960 2848678 Troy, you kidding!

2850520 2853216 That's great, Troy. Now you don't have to<br />hassle them people no more.
2853240 2856357 Oh, hell.<br />I didn't think I was gonna see you today.
2856440 2857919 I thought you was in jail.
2858040 2860400 Got it all over the Courier<br />about them raiding Seefus' place
2860440 2862954 where you be hanging out<br />with all them thugs.
2863040 2864856 Hey, Pop,<br />that ain't got nothing to do with me.
2864880 2866120 I don't go down there gambling.
2866160 2868037 I just go down there<br />to sit in with the band.
2868120 2870190 I ain't got nothing to do<br />with the gambling part.
2870280 2871793 They got some good music down there.
2871880 2873632 They got some rogues is what they got.
2873720 2875711 How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

2878560 2880096 How come you ain't brought<br />Bonnie like I told you?
2880120 2881176 You shoulda brought Bonnie.
2881200 2882576 She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.
2882600 2883840 I was just in the neighborhood.
2883880 2885376 - Thought I'd stop by.<br />- Here it comes.
2885400 2887595 Your daddy got<br />a promotion on the rubbish.
2887680 2889989 He gonna be the first colored driver.
2890080 2891416 Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there
2891440 2892936 and read the paper,<br />like them white fellas.
2892960 2895679 Hey, Pop, if you knew<br />how to read, you'd be all right.
2895760 2898274 Nah, nah. You mean<br />if the nigger knew how to drive,
2898360 2899696 he'd be all right.
2899720 2901336 Been fighting with them<br />people about driving
2901360 2903112 and ain't even got a license.
2903200 2904976 Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2905000 2906000 Driving ain't nothing.
2906080 2907896 All you do is point the truck<br />where you want it to go.
2907920 2908989 Driving ain't nothing.
2909080 2910696 Do they know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2910720 2911856 That's what I'm talkin' about.
2911880 2913240 I ain't asked if driving was easy.
2913320 2915675 I asked if Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license.
2915760 2916896 The man ain't got to know my business.
2916920 2919136 Time he find out, I have<br />two or three of them driver's license.
2919160 2921037 - Say, look here, Pop.<br />- I knew it was coming.
2921120 2923031 I knew what kinda<br />"Look here, Pop" that was.
2923120 2924480 Nigger finna ask me<br />for some money.
2924680 2926398 It's Friday night, it's my payday.
2926480 2929995 All them rogues down on the avenue,<br />the ones that ain't in jail,
2930080 2932799 and Lyons is hopping in his shoes<br />to get down there with them.
2932880 2933915 Now, see, Pop,
2934000 2936514 if you gave somebody else<br />a chance to talk sometime,
2936600 2940195 you'd see I was fixing to pay you back<br />your $10 like I told you.
2940280 2943431 Here. I told you I'd pay you<br />when Bonnie got paid.
2943520 2945715 No, you keep that $10.<br />Put it in the bank.
2945800 2947456 Next time you feel like<br />you wanna come by here

2949440 2950668 Here you go your $10, Pop.
2950800 2952616 I told you,<br />I don't want you to give me nothing.
2952640 2953868 I just wanted to borrow $10.
2953960 2956520 No, you keep that for the next time<br />you want to ask me.
2956800 2958119 Come on, Pop, here go your $10.
2958200 2961272 Troy, why don't you let the boy<br />pay you back?
2964120 2966680 Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,
2966760 2968716 I'm gonna hear about it<br />for the next six months.
2968800 2970438 You can hand yours over, too, Troy.
2970520 2972096 You see this, Bono?<br />You see how they do me?
2972120 2973872 Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.
2974000 2977310 Better get Ready for the Judgment
2978800 2980358 Better get ready
2983160 2985151 Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

3000080 3001600 What you been doing,<br />Uncle Gabe?
3001680 3005150 Oh, I been chasing hellhounds<br />and waiting for the time
3005240 3007071 to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.
3007160 3008832 You been chasing hellhounds, huh?
3008920 3010640 Well, you doing<br />the right thing, Uncle Gabe.
3010720 3013712 - Somebody's got to chase 'em.<br />- Oh, yeah, I know it.
3013800 3016678 The devil's strong.<br />The devil ain't no pushover.
3016760 3019194 Hellhounds<br />snipping at everybody's heels.
3019280 3021874 But I got my trumpet waiting<br />on the Judgment time.
3021960 3023736 Waiting on<br />the Battle of Armageddon, huh?
3023760 3025830 Oh, ain't gonna be too much of a battle
3025960 3029396 when God get to waving<br />that Judgment sword. Whoo!
3029480 3031550 But the people's<br />gonna have a hell of a time
3031640 3034200 trying to get into Heaven<br />if them Gates ain't open.
3034280 3035793 - You hear this, Pop?<br />- Mmm.
3036360 3038555 - Uncle Gabe, you all right.<br />- Lyons.
3041680 3042874 The King of the Jungle!
3042960 3044120 You stayin' for supper, Gabe?
3044200 3045336 You want me to fix you a plate?
3045360 3048272 I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.<br />I don't want no plate.
3048360 3050476 I want to eat with my hands.<br />I'll take a sandwich.
3050560 3051736 What about you, Lyons?<br />You stayin'?
3051760 3052954 Got some short ribs cooking.
3053040 3056510 Nah. I won't eat nothing<br />till after we finish playing.
3057160 3059151 You ought to come down,<br />listen to me play, Pop.
3059240 3061515 Oh, I don't like all that Chinese music,<br />all that noise.
3061600 3065070 Go in there and wash up, Gabe.<br />I'll fix you a sandwich.
3065160 3067799 - Troy mad at me.<br />- Huh?
3067880 3069233 What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?
3069320 3070416 He think Troy mad at him
3070440 3072158 'cause he moved over there<br />to Miss Pearl's.
3072240 3074376 I ain't mad at the man.<br />He can live where he want to live at.
3074400 3076616 Well, what he move over there for?<br />Miss Pearl don't like nobody.
3076640 3078456 Oh, she don't mind him none.<br />She treat him real nice.
3078480 3080000 She just don't allow all that singing.
3080040 3082640 She don't mind that rent he be paying.<br />That's what she don't mind.
3082680 3084256 Troy, I ain't goin' through that<br />with you no more.
3084280 3086136 He moved over there<br />'cause he wanted his own place.
3086160 3087296 He can come and go as he please.
3087320 3089496 He can come and go as he please here.<br />I wasn't stoppin' him.
3089520 3090816 I wasn't putting no rules on the man.
3090840 3092592 That ain't the same thing,<br />and you know it.
3092680 3093976 Now that's the last<br />I wanna hear about that.
3094000 3096256 I don't wanna hear nothin' else<br />about Gabe and Miss Pearl.
3096280 3097315 And next week...
3097400 3098913 I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.
3099000 3101216 And next week, when that recruiter<br />come from that school,
3101240 3103913 I want you to sign that paper<br />and go on and let Cory play football.
3104000 3105800 That'll be the last<br />I have to hear about that.
3110400 3112391 Cory got recruited?<br />What school he goin' to?
3112520 3114112 I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.
3114200 3116350 Boy walking around here<br />smelling his piss,
3116440 3117976 thinking he gonna do<br />what he want to do,
3118000 3120275 irregardless of what I say.
3120360 3122635 Look here, Bono,<br />I left the Commissioner's office
3122720 3124119 and went down to the A&P.
3124200 3126395 That boy ain't workin' down there,<br />he lied to me.
3126480 3129836 T ellin' me he got his job back,<br />tellin' me he workin' weekend,
3129920 3131478 tellin' me he workin' after school.
3131560 3133790 Mr. Stawicki says<br />he ain't working down there at all.
3133880 3135074 Cory just growing up.
3135160 3137296 He just bustin' at the seams,<br />tryin' to fill out your shoes.
3137320 3138469 I don't care what he doing.
3138560 3140640 When he get to the place<br />where he want to disobey me,
3140720 3143871 then it's time for him to move on.<br />Bono will tell you that.
3143960 3147635 I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy<br />without paying the consequences.
3147720 3149995 I ain't never had the chance.
3150080 3153675 My daddy came on through,<br />but I ain't never knew him to see him.
3153760 3156354 Or what he had on his mind,<br />or where he went.
3156440 3160115 Just moving on through.<br />Searching out the New Land.
3161000 3163309 That's what the old folks used to call it.
3163400 3166836 See a fella moving around<br />from place to place, woman to woman,
3166920 3169309 they call it<br />"Searching out the New Land."
3169400 3171038 I can't say if he ever found it.
3171800 3174268 I come along, didn't want no kids.
3174760 3176816 I didn't know if I was gonna<br />be in one place long enough
3176840 3178831 to fix on 'em right as their daddy.
3178920 3181036 I figured I was going searching, too.
3181120 3183350 As it turn out,<br />I been hooked up with Lucille
3183440 3185829 for near about as long as<br />your daddy been with Rose.
3185920 3188070 Going on 16 years.
3188160 3190080 Sometimes, I wish<br />I'd never known my daddy.
3190120 3193874 He ain't cared nothing about no kids.<br />A kid to him wasn't nothing.
3194280 3197431 All he wanted you to do<br />was learn how to walk,
3197520 3199192 so he could start you to working.
3199280 3203034 Come to eating, he ate first.<br />Anything left over, that's what you got.
3203120 3206192 Man would sit down,<br />eat two chickens, and give you the wing.
3206280 3209556 You ought to stop that, Pop.<br />Everybody feed their kids.
3209640 3212757 No matter how hard times is,<br />everybody care about their kids.
3212840 3214096 Make sure they have something to eat.
3214120 3215872 Only thing my daddy cared about
3215960 3217776 was getting them bales of cotton<br />in to Mr. Lubin.
3217800 3219836 That's the only thing<br />that mattered to him.
3219920 3222070 Sometimes, I used to wonder<br />why he was still living,
3222160 3224720 why the devil hadn't come and got him.
3224960 3226871 "Get them bales of cotton<br />in to Mr. Lubin."
3226960 3228313 Find out he owe him money.
3228400 3229456 He should have just<br />went on and left
3229480 3230656 when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.
3230680 3231776 That's what I would've done.
3231800 3234712 How he gonna leave with 11 kids?<br />And where he gonna go?
3234800 3237997 He ain't knew nothing but how to farm.<br />No, he was trapped.
3238400 3241551 I think he knew it, too.<br />But I'll say this for him...
3241640 3243392 He felt a responsibility toward us.
3243480 3245480 May not have treated us<br />like I felt he should have,
3245560 3247437 but without that responsibility,
3247520 3249476 he could have run off and left us,
3249600 3250919 made his own way.
3251000 3252399 A lot of them did.
3252480 3254136 Back in those days,<br />what you talkin' about?
3254160 3255840 - Mmm-mmm.<br />- They walk out their front door
3255880 3259077 and take off down one road or another<br />and just keep on walkin'.
3259160 3261071 There you go.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
3261160 3264516 Just keep on walking<br />till they come to something else.
3264600 3267910 Ain't you never heard of nobody<br />having the walking blues?
3268000 3270468 Now, that's what you call it<br />when you just take off like that.
3270640 3273154 Mmm, my daddy ain't had no<br />walking blues.
3273240 3274434 What you talking about?
3274520 3276040 He stayed right there with his family,
3276840 3280753 but he was just as evil as he could be!
3280880 3284509 My mama couldn't stand him.<br />Couldn't stand that evilness.
3284600 3287592 She run off when I was about eight.
3287720 3290837 She sneaked off one night,<br />told me she was coming back for me.
3290920 3292638 I ain't never seen her no more.
3292720 3296838 All his women run off and left him.<br />He wasn't good for nobody.
3297360 3299032 My turn come to head out.
3299120 3300473 I was 14,
3300560 3303438 got to sniffing around<br />Joe Canewell's daughter.
3304800 3307109 We had this old mule called "Greyboy".
3307240 3309356 My daddy sent me out<br />to do some plowing.
3309440 3313115 I got to fooling around<br />with Joe Canewell's daughter.
3313200 3316397 Found us a nice spot,<br />got real cozy with each other.
3316480 3319677 She was about 13,<br />so we done figured we grown anyway.
3319760 3322149 So, we were down there by the creek,<br />enjoying ourselves,
3322240 3323639 ain't thinking about nothing.
3323720 3326029 Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,
3326120 3329556 wandered back to the house,<br />and my daddy was lookin' for me.
3329840 3333310 So, we down there enjoying ourselves<br />when he come up on us.
3333400 3335470 Surprised us.
3335600 3338114 Had them leather straps off that mule,
3338200 3341237 commenced to whupping me<br />like there was no tomorrow.
3341320 3343914 I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.
3344600 3346716 I was scared of my daddy.
3346920 3348911 Now, when he commenced<br />to whipping on me,
3349000 3350760 quite naturally,<br />I run to get out of the way.
3350800 3353473 Now, I think he's mad<br />'cause I ain't done my work.
3353560 3356199 But I see where he's chasing me off,
3356280 3358191 so he can have the gal for himself.
3359600 3361716 When I see what the matter of it was,
3362600 3366878 I lost all fear of my daddy,<br />and right there, I became a man.
3366960 3369349 Fourteen years of age.
3369440 3372352 Now, it's my turn to run him off.
3372440 3374237 I picked up them same reins<br />he used on me.
3374320 3377915 I picked up them reins,<br />I commenced to whupping on him.
3378960 3381269 Gal jump up, she run off.
3383200 3384428 When he turned to face me,
3384520 3386397 I knew why the devil<br />never come and get him
3386480 3388630 'cause he was the devil himself.
3389960 3392520 I don't know what happened.
3392600 3395797 I woke up,<br />laying there by the creek,
3395880 3399555 and Blue, this old dog we had,<br />he was licking my face.
3399640 3402677 Both my eyes were swoll shut.
3402760 3404591 I thought I was blind,<br />I couldn't see nothing.
3404680 3408389 I just laid there and cried.
3413960 3416872 And I didn't know what I was gonna do.
3416960 3421397 But I knew the time had come<br />for me to leave my daddy's house.
3422680 3424989 Suddenly, the world got big, and...
3428080 3431993 It was a long time before I could<br />cut it down to where I could handle it.
3433680 3436513 Part of that cutting down<br />was where I got to the place
3436600 3438591 where I could feel him<br />kicking in my blood,
3438680 3440336 and I knew the only thing<br />that separated us
3440360 3442476 was a matter of a few years.
3445520 3447000 What you got there,<br />Uncle Gabe?
3447880 3449313 I got me a ham sandwich.
3449400 3451550 Rose gave me a ham sandwich.
3454040 3456190 I lost touch with everybody<br />except Gabriel.
3461200 3462200 But...
3465880 3467711 I hope he's dead.
3471960 3474633 I hope he found some peace.
3474720 3476756 That's a heavy story, Pop.
3478160 3481948 I didn't know you left home<br />when you was 14.
3482080 3484116 Fourteen's kinda young<br />to be on your own.
3484200 3486077 I don't know what I would've done.
3486840 3489638 Well, I got up from that creek,<br />walked on down to Mobile.
3489720 3493395 I was through with farming.<br />I figured I'd do better in the cities.
3493480 3495311 So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.
3495400 3497834 Wait a minute,<br />you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.
3499080 3501116 Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.
3501200 3503156 You talking about some walking there!
3503240 3505993 That's the only way you got anywhere<br />back in them days.
3506080 3508913 Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have<br />hitched a ride with somebody.
3509000 3510736 Who you gonna hitch it with?
3510760 3512616 There ain't no cars<br />and things like they got now.
3512640 3514278 We talking about 1918.
3514360 3515918 What you all out here gettin' into?
3516000 3518195 I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.
3518280 3519616 He don't know nothing<br />about this I'm talking.
3519640 3521080 Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.
3521120 3522456 She says you supposed to pick her up.
3522480 3524232 Yeah, okay, Rose.
3524320 3527039 I walked on down to Mobile,
3527120 3530396 hitched up with some fellows<br />that was coming up this way.
3530480 3532118 Got up here and found out,
3532200 3533713 not only could you not get a job,
3533840 3535353 you couldn't find no place to live.
3535440 3538079 I thought I was in freedom.
3538360 3540749 Colored folks living down there<br />on the riverbanks
3540840 3543136 in whatever kind of shelter<br />they could find for themselves.
3543160 3545628 Right down there<br />under the Brady Street Bridge.
3546040 3549350 Living down there in shacks<br />made out of sticks and tar paper.
3550400 3552118 Messed around down there.
3552200 3554714 Went from bad to worse.<br />Started stealing.
3554800 3557394 First, it was food.<br />Then I figure I steal me some money,
3557480 3559948 I can buy me some food,<br />buy me some shoes, too.
3560280 3562032 One thing led to another.<br />Met your mama.
3562480 3564789 I was young, anxious to be a man.
3565360 3567715 I met your mama and had you.<br />Why'd I do that for?
3567800 3570234 Now, I got to worry about<br />feeding you and her.
3570320 3571799 Got to steal three times as much.
3572640 3576030 I went out one day<br />looking for somebody to rob.
3576160 3577520 That's what I was, I was a robber.
3578160 3579752 I'mma tell you the truth.
3579840 3581751 I'm ashamed of it today,<br />but it's the truth.
3582800 3584677 I went to rob this fella,<br />I pull out my knife.
3584760 3586910 He pulled out a gun,<br />shot me in the chest.
3587000 3590231 It felt like somebody had taken<br />a hot branding iron and laid it on me.
3590320 3593357 Now, when he shot me,<br />I jumped at him with my knife,
3595240 3597071 and they say I killed him.
3597160 3599296 Locked me up, put me<br />in the penitentiary for 15 years.
3599320 3600673 That's where I met Bono.
3601240 3603515 Where I learned how to play baseball.
3603600 3605176 Got out that place,<br />and your mama had taken you,
3605200 3607191 went on to make a life without me.
3607280 3609350 Fifteen years was a long time<br />for her to wait.
3609440 3611376 But that 15 years<br />cured me of that robbing stuff.
3611400 3612753 Rose'll tell you.
3612840 3615115 I first met her, she ask me if I had
3615200 3617350 gotten all that foolishness<br />out of my system.
3617440 3619271 I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball,
3619360 3621078 "all what count to me."<br />You hear me, Bono?
3621160 3623799 And I meant it, too.<br />She said, "Which one come first?"
3623880 3626952 I said, "Well, ain't no<br />doubt it's baseball.
3627040 3628996 "But you stick and get old with me,
3629080 3630640 "and we'll both outlive this baseball."
3630720 3632836 Am I right, Rose?
3634040 3635109 And it's true.
3635200 3637016 Man, hush your mouth.<br />You ain't say no such thing.
3637040 3639696 Talkin' about, "Baby, you know<br />you'll always be number one with me."
3639720 3642314 That's what you was talking.
3642400 3643628 That's why I love this woman.
3643720 3644936 Rose will keep you straight.
3644960 3647076 You get off the track,<br />she'll straighten you up.
3647160 3648576 Lyons, you better get on up<br />and get Bonnie.
3648600 3650079 She waiting on you.
3650160 3651434 - Hey, Pop.<br />- Yeah?
3651520 3653556 You ought to come down to the Grill,<br />hear me play.
3654200 3655918 Oh, man, I ain't goin' down there.
3656000 3657496 I'm too old<br />to be hanging out in them clubs.
3657520 3660796 You got to be good to<br />play down at the Grill.
3660880 3662359 Come on, Pop.
3662440 3666228 - I got to get up in the morning.<br />- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

3683240 3685256 and bring Bonnie,<br />you know I'm always glad to see her.
3685280 3688750 I'll do that, Rose.<br />You take care now.
3688840 3690353 - See you, Pop.<br />- All right.
3690440 3692510 See you, Mr. Bono.
3692600 3695637 - See you, Uncle Gabe!<br />- Lyons! King of the Jungle!

3699800 3702075 - I'mma tear it up, too.<br />- Troy, I done told you now!

3704120 3706315 I done know this nigger since...
3706400 3708868 - How long have I known you?<br />- It's been a long time.
3708960 3711349 I done known this nigger<br />since Skippy was a pup!
3711440 3713271 Me and him<br />done been through some times!
3713360 3715032 You sure are right about that.
3715120 3717111 Hell, I known him<br />longer than I known you, Rose,
3717200 3719031 and we still standin'<br />shoulder to shoulder.
3719120 3722510 Look here, Bono,<br />a man can't ask for no more than that.
3722600 3723828 I love you, nigger.
3723920 3725876 Oh, hell! I love you, too.
3725960 3728952 But I got to get home, see my woman.<br />You got yours in hand.
3729360 3730793 I got to go get mine.
3732760 3734637 What you do that for, Pop?
3734720 3736136 What's the matter?<br />Cory, what's the matter?
3736160 3737976 Pop done went up to the school<br />and told Coach Zellman
3738000 3739200 I can't play football no more.
3739240 3740753 Wouldn't even let me play the game.
3740880 3742416 Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.
3742440 3744237 - Troy.<br />- What you Troying me for?
3744320 3745976 Yeah, I did it.<br />And the boy knows why I did it.
3746000 3747936 Why you wanna do that to me?<br />That was the one chance I had!
3747960 3749456 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with Cory playing football, Troy.
3749480 3750629 The boy lied to me.
3750720 3753234 I told the nigger,<br />"You want to play football,
3753320 3754594 "you keep up with your chores
3754680 3757194 "hold that job down at the A&P."<br />That was the conditions.
3757280 3758760 I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...
3758840 3761559 I can't work after school<br />during the football season, Pop.
3761640 3763856 I tried to tell you<br />Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.
3763880 3765296 You don't never want to listen to nobody,
3765320 3766656 and then you wanna go<br />and do this to me?
3766680 3768296 I ain't done nothin' to you.<br />You done it to yourself.
3768320 3769912 Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!
3770000 3772360 You're just scared<br />I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!
3777800 3779028 - Come here.<br />- Troy.

3817800 3819552 See, you done made a mistake.
3819720 3822320 - I didn't even do nothing!<br />- I'll tell you what your mistake was.

3834840 3836068 That's strike one.

3952800 3954028 Come on.
3964400 3966277 Troy, what they say down there?

3972840 3975115 He in the house,<br />helping me clean out these cupboards.
3975240 3977240 All right,<br />tell him to get his butt out here.
3979560 3981516 All they want is the money.
3981600 3983856 This makes six, seven times,<br />I done went down there and got him.
3983880 3986110 See me coming,<br />they stick out their hands.
3986200 3988953 Yeah, I know what you mean.<br />That's all they care about, that money.
3989040 3991110 They don't care about what's right.
3992480 3996951 Nigger, why you got to go<br />and get some hardwood?
3997040 3999315 You ain't doing nothin'<br />but building a little old fence.
3999400 4001311 Get you some soft pinewood.<br />That's all you need.
4001400 4003000 I know what I'm doing.<br />This outside wood.
4003080 4005310 You put pinewood inside the house.
4005400 4008472 Pinewood inside wood.<br />This here the outside wood.
4008560 4010710 Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?
4012160 4013957 You don't need this wood.
4014040 4015519 You can put it up with pinewood,
4015600 4017920 and it'll stand as long as<br />you gonna be here looking at it.
4017960 4019496 How you know<br />how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?
4019520 4021192 Hell, I might live forever.
4021280 4023874 I'll live longer than old man Horsely.
4023960 4025678 That's what Magee used to say.
4025760 4028120 Ah, Magee a damn fool.<br />Now you tell me who you ever heard of
4028200 4031237 gonna pull their own teeth<br />with a pair of rusty pliers?
4031320 4032435 They're old folks.
4032520 4034440 My granddaddy used to<br />pull his teeth with pliers.
4034520 4036640 They ain't had no dentists<br />for colored folk back then.
4036760 4039274 Well, get clean pliers.<br />You understand? Clean pliers.
4039360 4041920 Sterilize them.<br />Besides, we ain't living back then.
4042360 4045158 All he had to do<br />was go down to Doc Goldblum's.
4045240 4047800 I see where you<br />and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,
4048440 4050396 see where you all done got tight.
4050480 4051754 What you mean, "got tight"?
4051840 4053936 I see where you be laughing<br />and joking with her all the time.
4053960 4056679 I laugh and joke with 'em all.<br />Bono, you know me.
4056760 4058960 Ain't the kind of laughing and joking<br />I'm talking about.
4060480 4061879 How you doing, Mr. Bono?
4061960 4063736 Cory, get that saw from Bono<br />and cut some wood.
4063760 4066194 He talking about wood too hard to cut.
4066280 4067872 Stand back there, Jim.
4068000 4069296 Let the young boy<br />show you how it's done.
4069320 4071470 He's sure welcome to it.
4074080 4075479 Whew-ee!
4075880 4080112 Look at that.<br />Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.
4081320 4082799 Hell, I must be getting old
4082880 4084960 the way I'm watching that boy<br />whip through that wood.
4085040 4087429 I don't see why Mama<br />wants a fence around no yard no way.
4087560 4088595 Damn if I know, either.
4088680 4090750 I don't know what the hell<br />she keeping out with it.
4090840 4092831 She ain't got nothing nobody wants.
4094080 4095957 Some people build fences<br />to keep people out,
4096040 4098349 and other people build fences<br />to keep people in.
4099320 4101629 Rose wants to hold on to you all.<br />She loves you.
4102360 4105352 Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody<br />to tell me my wife loves me.
4105440 4108910 Cory, go in the house<br />and see if you can find the other saw.
4109040 4110678 Where's it at?
4110760 4113558 I said find it.<br />Look for it till you find it.
4116360 4119750 What is that supposed to mean?<br />Want to keep us in?
4134320 4135435 Troy,
4136240 4139789 I done known you seem like<br />damn near my whole life.
4139880 4142633 You and Rose both.<br />I known both of you all for a long time.
4143720 4146188 I remember when you met Rose.
4146280 4149238 When you was hitting them baseball<br />out of the park.
4149600 4151830 A lot of them old gals was after you then.
4151960 4153916 You had the pick of the litter.
4154000 4157595 When you picked Rose,<br />I was happy for you.
4158480 4161870 That's the first time<br />I knew you had any sense.
4162240 4165152 I said, "My man Troy<br />knows what he's doing.
4165240 4168391 "I'm gonna follow this nigger,<br />he might take me somewhere."
4168800 4170836 I been following you, too.
4170920 4174469 I done learned a whole heap of things<br />about life watching you.
4175960 4179191 I done learned how to tell<br />where the shit lies.
4179320 4181595 How to tell it from the alfalfa.
4182320 4184788 You done learned me a lot of things.
4184880 4187474 Showed me how to not<br />make the same mistakes.
4187960 4189757 To take life as it come along,
4189840 4192513 keep putting one foot<br />in front of the other.
4193000 4194353 Rose is a good woman, Troy.
4194440 4195634 I know she a good woman.
4195720 4197280 I've been married to her for 18 years.
4197320 4198673 What you got on your mind, Bono?
4198760 4201149 I just say she's a good woman,<br />like I say anything.
4201240 4202616 I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.
4202640 4205096 You just say she a good woman<br />and leave it hanging out there like that?
4205120 4206296 Why are you telling me<br />she a good woman?
4206320 4209153 - She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.<br />- Uh-huh.
4209240 4210440 You saying I don't measure up?
4210560 4211788 That's what you tryin' to say.
4211880 4213656 I don't measure up<br />'cause I'm seeing this other gal.
4213680 4214880 I know what you tryin' to say.
4214920 4217070 I know what Rose means to you, Troy.
4217160 4220118 I'm just tryin' to say<br />I don't want to see you mess up.
4222120 4223314 Yeah.
4227000 4229673 Well, I appreciate that, Bono.
4231720 4235395 If you was messing around on Lucille,<br />I'd be telling you the same thing.
4235480 4236993 That's all I got to say.
4238040 4240998 I just say that 'cause I love you both.
4241480 4244040 Oh. Yeah.
4244880 4247348 You know me.<br />I wasn't out there looking for nothing.
4247440 4249874 You can't find<br />a better woman than Rose, I know that.
4250200 4253033 But it seems like<br />this woman just stuck on to me
4253120 4254320 where I can't shake her loose.
4254360 4256016 I done wrestled with it<br />and tried to throw her off,
4256040 4258474 but now she stuck on tighter.
4258560 4260869 And now she stuck on for good.
4260960 4263713 You's in control.<br />That's what you tell me all the time.
4263800 4265552 You responsible for what you do.
4265640 4267392 I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.
4267480 4269869 As long as it set right in my heart,<br />then I'm okay.
4269960 4272872 'Cause that's all I listen to.<br />It tell me right and wrong every time.
4272960 4274856 And I ain't talking about<br />doing Rose no bad turn.
4274880 4276313 I love Rose.
4276400 4279392 She done carried me a long ways,<br />and I love and respect her for that.
4279480 4280629 I know you do.
4280720 4282836 That's why I don't want<br />to see you hurt her.
4282920 4285309 But what you gonna do<br />when she finds out?
4285760 4287830 What you got then?
4287920 4289319 You try to juggle both of them,
4289400 4291152 sooner or later,<br />you gonna drop one of them.
4291240 4293480 - That's common sense.<br />- I know what you're saying, Bono.
4295160 4297196 I been trying to figure a way<br />to work it out.
4297280 4299316 Work it out right, Troy.
4299440 4302079 I ain't trying to get all up<br />between you and Rose's business,
4302160 4304355 but work it, so it come out right.
4304440 4306670 Hell, I get all between<br />you and Lucille's business.
4306760 4309718 And when you gonna buy that woman<br />that refrigerator she be wanting?
4309800 4311472 And don't tell me<br />you ain't got no money.
4311560 4312834 I know who your banker is.
4312920 4315496 Mellon don't need that money<br />as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.
4315520 4316520 I know that.
4316600 4317776 - Tell you what I'll do.<br />- What?
4317800 4319791 When you finish building<br />this fence for Rose,
4319880 4321518 I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.
4321600 4324478 You done stuck your foot<br />in your mouth now.
4325600 4327192 Hey, nigger, where you going?
4327280 4328508 I'm going home.
4328600 4330431 I know you don't expect me<br />to help you now.
4330520 4331953 I'm protecting my money.
4332440 4335352 I want to see you<br />put that fence up by yourself.
4335440 4337032 That's what I want to see.
4337120 4339350 You'll be here<br />another six months without me.
4339480 4340799 Nigger, you ain't right.
4340880 4342552 When it come to my money,
4342640 4345712 I'm right as fireworks<br />on the Fourth of July.
4345800 4347279 We gonna see.
4347360 4348952 You better get out your bank book!
4401000 4403080 What they say down there?<br />What's happening with Gabe?
4403160 4406118 I went down there<br />and got him out. Cost me $50.
4406200 4407633 Said he was disturbing the peace.
4407720 4410154 Judge set up a hearing for him<br />in three weeks
4410240 4412834 to show cause<br />why he shouldn't be recommitted.
4412920 4414592 What'd you say?<br />What'd you tell the judge?
4415000 4416638 I told him I'd take care of him.
4416720 4418336 It didn't make no sense<br />to recommit the man.
4418360 4419759 He stuck out his big greasy palm,
4419840 4422513 told me to give him $50<br />and take him on home.
4422600 4424511 Where's he at now?<br />Where'd he go off to?
4424600 4426576 Gone about his business.<br />He don't need nobody to hold his hand.
4426600 4428856 Well, I don't know, seem like<br />that would be the best place for him.
4428880 4429880 To put him in a hospital.
4429960 4432554 I know what you gonna say,<br />but that's what I think would be best.
4432640 4434280 Man had his life ruined<br />fighting for what?
4434360 4435656 Now, they want to take him<br />and lock him up?
4435680 4437989 Let him be free.<br />Man ain't bothering nobody.
4438200 4441909 Everybody got<br />their own way of looking at it, I guess.
4442040 4443268 Come on, get your lunch.
4443360 4445016 I got some lima beans<br />and cornbread in the oven.
4445040 4446176 Come on, get somethin' to eat.
4446200 4447840 Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.
4447920 4449216 Rose, I got something to tell you.
4449240 4452073 - Wait till I put the food on the table.<br />- Rose...
4452920 4455753 Now, I don't know how to tell you this.
4459680 4461716 And I can't explain it none.
4461800 4464951 It just sort of grows on you.
4465960 4469077 It started off like a little bush,
4469160 4470536 next thing you know, it's a whole forest.
4470560 4471879 Troy, what is you talking about?
4471960 4473757 I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.
4473840 4475637 I'm trying to tell you,
4475720 4478154 find a way to tell you that...
4483240 4485549 I'm gonna be a daddy.
4487720 4489995 Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.
4494560 4497313 Troy, you ain't telling me this.<br />You're gonna be what?
4497400 4498776 - You're gonna be somebody's daddy?<br />- Rose...
4498800 4499936 You're telling your wife this?
4499960 4500995 Now...
4501080 4503310 Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!
4503400 4505994 I got to wait 18 years<br />to hear something like this?
4506080 4507308 Hey, Rose.
4509240 4511595 I got a flower for you.
4514280 4517829 That's a rose.<br />The same rose like you is.
4522840 4524273 Thanks, Gabe.
4524360 4525760 Troy, you ain't mad at me?
4525840 4527273 Them bad mens<br />come and put me away.
4527360 4529749 - You ain't mad at me?<br />- No. No, I ain't mad at you.
4529840 4531751 Eighteen years,<br />and you want to come with this?
4531880 4534519 See what I got?<br />Got a brand-new quarter.
4537440 4538509 Rose, it's just that...
4538600 4540800 Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.<br />Ain't no explaining it.
4540880 4543519 The fella that give me this quarter<br />had a whole mess of 'em!
4543640 4546108 I'm gonna keep this quarter<br />till it stops shining.
4546200 4548800 Gabe, go on up front now.<br />I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.
4548840 4549989 Go on. I'll get you a piece.
4550080 4552799 Say, Rose, you know,<br />I was chasing hellhounds,
4552880 4555792 and them bad mens come<br />and get me and take me away.
4555880 4557871 Troy helped me.<br />He come down there and told them
4557960 4560872 they better let me go<br />before he beat them up!
4560960 4562234 Yeah, he did!
4562320 4564595 Go up front now, Gabe.<br />I'll get you some watermelon.
4564680 4566159 Them bad men is gone now.
4566240 4568595 Okay. Rose gonna give me<br />some watermelon,
4568680 4571148 the kind with the stripes on it.
4576640 4578073 Why, Troy?
4579840 4581068 Why?
4581160 4586598 After all these years,<br />you come dragging this in to me now?
4586680 4588830 It don't make no sense at your age.
4589520 4593308 I could've expected this<br />10, or 15 years ago, but not now.
4593600 4595830 Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.
4599920 4603196 I done tried to be everything<br />a wife should be.
4605200 4606474 Everything a wife could be.
4606560 4607834 I've been married 18 years,
4607920 4610434 and now,<br />I got to live to see the day you tell me
4610520 4614035 you been seeing another woman<br />and done fathered a child by her.
4627200 4631193 And you know I never wanted<br />no half-nothing in my family!
4634200 4635474 My whole family is half.
4635560 4637391 Everybody got different<br />fathers and mothers
4637480 4638959 and my two sisters and my brothers.
4639040 4640632 You could hardly tell who's who.
4640720 4642536 Could never sit down<br />and talk about Papa and Mama.
4642560 4645199 It was always your papa,<br />your mama, my papa, my mama.
4645280 4647794 And I ain't never wanted that<br />for none of my children!
4647880 4649256 And now,<br />you want to drag your behind in here
4649280 4650456 and tell me something like this!
4650480 4652496 Stop it now. You ought to know.<br />It's time for you to know.
4652520 4654238 Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!
4674240 4675309 Rose?
4678440 4681830 I just can't make it go away.<br />It's done now.
4681920 4685833 I can't wish the circumstances<br />of the thing away.
4686000 4688594 And you don't want to, either.
4688680 4690477 Maybe you want to wish me<br />and my boy away.
4690560 4691913 Maybe that's what you want.
4692040 4694508 Well, you can't wish us away.
4694600 4696556 I got 18 years of my life invested in you.
4696640 4698736 You ought to have stayed upstairs<br />in my bed where you belong.
4698760 4701354 Now, listen to me.<br />We can get a handle on this thing.
4701440 4703280 We can talk this out,<br />come to an understanding.
4703360 4704588 All of a sudden it's "we."
4704720 4706016 Where was "we" at<br />when you were down there,
4706040 4707416 rolling around<br />with some godforsaken woman?
4707440 4708736 "We" should've<br />come to an understanding
4708760 4710336 before you started making<br />a damn fool of yourself!
4710360 4711800 You're a day late and a dollar short
4711880 4713296 when it comes to<br />an understanding with me.
4713320 4719077 Rose, it's just that<br />she gives me a different idea.
4719600 4722751 A different understanding about myself.
4722840 4726310 I can step out of this house<br />and get away from the pressures
4726400 4727816 and the problems, be a different man.
4727840 4729696 I ain't got to worry about<br />how I'll get the roof fixed,
4729720 4731358 or pay the bills, or...
4731440 4732759 I can just
4734720 4737314 be a part of myself<br />I ain't never been before.
4738520 4740670 What I want to know is...
4743200 4745668 What I want to know
4745800 4748439 is do you plan to continue seeing her?
4748520 4750829 That's all you can say to me.
4752120 4753758 I could sit up in her house and laugh.
4753840 4756195 You understand what I'm saying?
4756280 4758874 I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.
4758960 4761190 It reaches all the way down<br />to the bottom of my shoes.
4761280 4762474 Rose, I...
4764880 4767678 I can't give that up.
4773480 4775696 Well, maybe you ought to go on<br />and stay down there with her,
4775720 4777392 if she's a better woman than me.
4777480 4779296 It ain't about nobody being<br />a better woman, or nothing.
4779320 4780639 Rose, you ain't to blame.
4780720 4782995 A man couldn't ask<br />for a better wife than you've been.
4783080 4784559 I'm responsible for it.
4784640 4786198 I done locked myself into a pattern,
4786280 4788336 trying to take care of you all,<br />that I forgot about myself.
4788360 4789998 Well, what the hell was I there for?
4790080 4791638 That was my job, not somebody else's.
4791720 4794837 Rose, listen to me.<br />I done tried all my life to live decent.
4794920 4797832 To live a clean, hard, useful life.
4797920 4801071 I try to be a good husband to you,<br />in every way I know how.
4801160 4803355 Maybe I come into the world backwards,<br />I don't know,
4803440 4806750 but you're born with two strikes on you<br />before you come to the plate.
4806840 4807960 You got to guard it closely,
4808040 4810679 always looking for the curveball<br />on the inside corner.
4810760 4812398 You can't afford a called strike.
4812480 4813880 You can't let nothing get past you.
4813920 4816036 If you're going down,<br />you're doing down swinging.
4816120 4818839 Everything lined up against you!
4820520 4822033 What you gonna do?
4823640 4826074 I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.
4826520 4830354 When I found you and Cory<br />and a halfway decent job, I was safe.
4830440 4832635 Couldn't nothing touch me!
4832720 4834153 I wasn't gonna strike out no more.
4834240 4835696 I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.
4835720 4838075 I wasn't gonna<br />lie in the street with a bottle of wine.
4838160 4842438 I was safe. I had me a family,<br />a job.
4843640 4846313 I wasn't gonna get that last strike.
4848080 4850958 I was standing on first base,
4851040 4853056 waiting for one of them boys<br />to knock me in, to bring me home.
4853080 4854877 You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
4854960 4856456 Then I saw the gal,<br />she firmed up my backbone.
4856480 4859438 I got to thinkin' that if I tried,<br />maybe I could steal second.
4859520 4861056 - You understand?<br />- You should've held me tight.
4861080 4864470 - You should've grabbed me and held on.<br />- I stood on first base for 18 years,
4864560 4866949 and I thought, well,<br />God damn it, go on for it!
4867040 4869429 We ain't talking about baseball!
4869520 4871896 We talking about you going off<br />and laying up with another woman,
4871920 4872976 then bringing it home to me.
4873000 4875336 That's what we're talking about.<br />We're not talkin' about no baseball!
4875360 4876616 Rose, you're not listening to me.
4876640 4879518 I'm trying to explain it to you<br />the best way I know how.
4881080 4882354 It's not easy for me to admit
4882480 4885552 that I've been standing<br />in the same place for 18 years!
4885640 4888154 Well, I've been standing with you!
4888240 4892279 I've been right here with you, Troy!<br />I got a life, too.
4892360 4896592 I gave 18 years of my life<br />to stand in the same spot as you!
4896680 4898636 Don't you think<br />I ever wanted other things?
4898720 4900836 Don't you think<br />I had dreams and hopes?
4900920 4903514 What about my life? What about me?
4903600 4906200 Don't you think it ever crossed my mind<br />to want to know other men?
4906280 4910592 That I wanted to lay up somewhere<br />and forget about my responsibilities?
4910680 4912272 That I wanted someone<br />to make me laugh,
4912360 4914396 so I could feel good?
4914480 4916550 You're not the only one<br />who's got wants and needs.
4916680 4918591 But I held on to you, Troy.
4918680 4922832 I took all my feelings,<br />my wants and needs and dreams,
4922920 4924717 and I buried them inside you.
4924800 4927075 I planted a seed<br />and watched and prayed over it.
4927160 4930152 I planted myself inside you<br />and waited to bloom!
4930240 4934074 And it didn't take me no 18 years<br />to realize the soil was hard and rocky,
4934160 4936276 and it wasn't never gonna bloom!
4936360 4939272 But I held on to you, Troy.<br />I held you tighter.
4939360 4941351 You was my husband.
4941440 4944079 I owed you everything I had.
4944160 4946833 Every part of me I could find to give you.
4946960 4950748 And upstairs in that bedroom,<br />with the darkness falling in on me,
4950880 4954953 I gave everything I had<br />to try and erase the doubt
4955040 4957713 that you wasn't the finest man<br />in the world.
4957800 4960473 And wherever you was going,<br />I was gonna be there with you,
4960600 4963034 because you was my husband.
4964480 4967472 'Cause that's the only way<br />I was gonna survive as your wife.
4968720 4972395 You always talking about what you give<br />and what you don't have to give.
4973080 4974798 But you take, too, Troy.
4974880 4977519 You take<br />and don't even know nobody's giving.
4977600 4978656 You say I take and don't give.
4978680 4979829 Troy, you're hurting me.
4979920 4982176 - Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!<br />- I gave you everything I got.
4982200 4983256 Don't you tell that lie on me.
4983280 4984679 - Mama!<br />- Don't you tell that lie!
4984760 4986273 Troy, you're hurting me!
4986880 4988233 Troy! Troy!
4988640 4992315 All right. That's strike two.
4993160 4997358 You stay away from around me, boy.<br />Don't you strike out.
4999040 5001031 You're living with a full count.
5004600 5006397 Don't you strike out!
5206880 5208711 Troy, I want to talk to you.
5211360 5213430 All of a sudden?
5215480 5217948 After all this time,<br />you want to talk to me, huh?
5219040 5220576 You ain't wanted<br />to talk to me in months.
5220600 5221976 You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.
5222000 5223479 You didn't want no parts of me then.
5224120 5226111 What you want to talk to me about now?
5229760 5231239 Tomorrow's Friday.
5231320 5232719 I know what day tomorrow is.
5232800 5234056 You think I don't know<br />tomorrow's Friday?
5234080 5236296 My whole life, I ain't done nothing<br />but look to see Friday coming,
5236320 5237696 and you got to tell me it's Friday.
5237720 5239233 I want to know if you're coming home.
5239800 5242234 I always come home, Rose.<br />You know that.
5242320 5243776 Ain't never been a night<br />I ain't come home.
5243800 5245438 That ain't what I mean, and you know it.
5245640 5249076 I wanna know if you're coming<br />straight home after work.
5249160 5252118 I figured I'd cash my check,<br />hang out at Taylors' with the boys.
5252200 5253376 Maybe play a game of checkers.
5253400 5255994 Troy, I can't live like this.<br />I won't live like this.
5256080 5257536 You're living on borrowed time with me.
5257560 5259616 Been going on six months now,<br />you ain't been coming home.
5259640 5261676 I come home every night.<br />Every night of the year.
5261760 5264228 That's 365 days.
5265760 5268354 I want you to come home<br />tomorrow after work.
5273360 5277035 Rose, I don't mess up my pay.<br />You know that.
5277120 5278997 I take my pay, I give it to you.
5279080 5282436 I don't have no money<br />but what you give me back.
5282520 5285671 I just want a little time to myself.
5285800 5286949 A little time to enjoy life.
5287040 5288917 What about me?<br />When's my time to enjoy life?
5289000 5291136 I don't know what to tell you, Rose.<br />I'm doing the best I can.
5291160 5292256 You ain't been comin' home from work,
5292280 5293696 but time enough<br />to change your clothes and run out.
5293720 5295711 You wanna call that<br />the best you can do?
5297280 5300352 I'm going over to the hospital<br />to see Alberta.
5301480 5303152 She went into the hospital<br />this afternoon.
5303240 5306676 Looks like she might have the baby early.
5307560 5309232 I won't be gone long.
5315640 5317456 Well, you ought to know.<br />They went over to Miss Pearl's
5317480 5318708 and got Gabe today.
5318800 5322554 She said you told them to<br />go ahead and lock him up.
5322640 5326599 I ain't said no such thing.<br />Whoever told you that is telling a lie.
5326680 5328456 Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing<br />but telling a big, fat lie.
5328480 5330416 She ain't had to tell me.<br />I read it on the papers.
5330440 5332416 - What'd it say, huh?<br />- It said you told them to take him.
5332440 5334896 Oh, well, then they screwed that up,<br />just like they screw up everything.
5334920 5336216 I ain't worried about<br />what they got on that paper.
5336240 5338216 It say the government sends<br />part of the check to the hospital,
5338240 5339309 the other part to you.
5339400 5341096 I got nothing to do with that,<br />if that's the way it works.
5341120 5342240 I don't make up the rules...
5342320 5343656 You did Gabe just like you did Cory.
5343680 5344936 You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,
5344960 5346656 but you signed for Gabe!<br />You signed that paper!
5346680 5348511 I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.
5348600 5350256 Hell, the only thing I signed<br />was the release form.
5350280 5351280 Hell, I can't read,
5351360 5352736 I don't know what they had<br />on that paper.
5352760 5354600 I ain't signed nothing<br />about sending Gabe away.
5354680 5356896 I said send him to the hospital,<br />you said let him go free.
5356920 5357920 Then you went down there
5358040 5359536 and you signed him to the hospital<br />for half his money.
5359560 5361936 You went back on yourself, Troy.<br />You're gonna have to answer for that.
5361960 5363576 You just been over there<br />talking to Miss Pearl.
5363600 5366216 She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'<br />Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

5368960 5371633 And what she doing got papers<br />on my brother for, anyway?

5375480 5377311 and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!
5383280 5385794 You ain't seen nothing I signed!

5567480 5569869 They said they done all they could.<br />They...

5603880 5606758 Oh, what about the baby? Baby all right?
5608680 5610750 They say it's healthy.
5613080 5614513 I wonder who's gonna bury her.
5614600 5615635 She had a family, Rose.
5615720 5617256 She wasn't living in the world by herself.
5617280 5619555 I know she wasn't living<br />in the world by herself.
5619640 5621096 Next thing you wanna know<br />if she had any insurance.

6562720 6566235 'Cause that's what you need.<br />You got that?
6566320 6567320 Huh?
6567400 6570040 You don't know what I got!<br />You ain't got to worry about what I got!
6570240 6571878 You right.
6572000 6573592 You 100% right.
6573680 6577434 I done spent the last 17 years<br />worrying about what you got.
6577520 6579238 Now, it's your turn, see?
6579320 6581390 I tell you what we do.
6582840 6585400 You grown.<br />We done established that.
6585840 6588593 You a man.<br />Now, let's see you act like one.
6588680 6590520 Turn your behind around<br />and walk out this yard.
6590560 6593640 And when you get out there in the alley,<br />you can forget about this house, see.
6593680 6594999 'Cause this is my house.
6595080 6597753 You go on and be a man<br />and get your own house.
6597840 6600115 You can forget about this,<br />'cause this is mine.
6600200 6602668 You go on and get yours,<br />'cause I'm through doing for you.
6603000 6604877 What you done for me.<br />What you ever give me?
6604960 6608396 Them feet. Them bones.<br />That pumping heart, nigger!
6609320 6611360 Give you more than anybody else<br />ever gonna give you.
6611400 6613595 You ain't never gave me nothing!
6613680 6615336 You ain't never done nothing<br />but hold me back,
6615360 6617715 afraid I was gonna be better than you!
6618280 6621431 All you ever did<br />was try and make me scared of you.
6621520 6623476 I used to tremble every time<br />you called my name.
6623560 6626279 Every time I heard<br />your footsteps in this house.
6626360 6628256 Wondering all the time,<br />"What's Pop gonna say if I do this?
6628280 6629536 "What's he gonna say if I do that?
6629560 6631391 "What's Pop gonna say<br />if I turn on the radio?"
6631640 6633096 And Mom, too!<br />She tries, but she's scared of you.
6633120 6634536 Leave your mama out of this.<br />Your mama ain't got...
6634560 6636256 I don't know how she stands you<br />after what you did to her!
6636280 6637696 I told you, leave your mama outta this.
6637720 6639392 What are you gonna do?<br />Give me a whupping?
6639480 6641471 You can't whup me no more!<br />You're too old!
6641560 6642629 You're just an old man.
6643120 6644120 Nigger!
6644320 6646151 That's what you are.<br />You're just...
6648320 6651153 You're just another nigger<br />on the street to me.
6651320 6653629 - You're crazy! You know that?<br />- Yeah, go on.
6653720 6655995 Get on away from around me.<br />You got the devil in you.
6656080 6658336 You are just a crazy old man!<br />Talkin' about I got the "devil" in me!
6658360 6659395 Yeah. I am crazy.
6659480 6661357 If you don't get the hell out of my yard,
6661440 6663476 I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.
6663560 6665120 Now, go on,<br />get the hell out of my yard!
6665160 6666388 This ain't your yard!
6666480 6668096 You took Uncle Gabe's money<br />he got from the Army
6668120 6669696 to buy this house, when you put him out!
6669720 6672109 Get your black ass out of my yard!
6672280 6673633 I ain't going nowhere!
6673720 6675400 Come on, put me out,<br />I ain't scared of you.
6677280 6679032 - That's my bat.<br />- Come on.
6679120 6680792 - Put my bat down.<br />- Come on, put me out!
6681840 6684035 What's the matter?<br />You so bad. Put me out!
6684440 6686271 You're gonna have to use it.
6688200 6690839 You want to draw that bat back on me,<br />you're gonna have to use it.
6691000 6692000 Come on!
6693240 6694593 Come on!
6694680 6696955 You're gonna have to kill me.
6697040 6700191 You want to draw that bat back on me,
6701520 6703158 you're gonna have to kill me.
6704680 6705829 Come on.
6712800 6715951 Come on. Then I'll show you.
6716800 6717869 Come on!

6757080 6759150 Go on, get away from around my house.
6768920 6769920 Go on.
6770800 6772711 Tell Mama I'll be back for my things.
6772800 6775712 They'll be on the other side<br />of that fence!
6788040 6789712 Can't taste nothing.
6800200 6802350 I can't taste nothing.
6805400 6809109 Hallelujah!
6812040 6813553 Hallelujah.
6824080 6825479 Hallelujah.
6828080 6830389 I can't taste nothing no more.
6838240 6839593 Come on.
6840600 6842670 It's between you and me now.
6844080 6847755 Come on. Anytime you want.
6848760 6852275 Come on. I be ready for you.
6854000 6856753 But I ain't gonna be easy.
6869120 6870348 Raynell?
6870440 6872271 - Ma'am?<br />- What you doing?
6872360 6873475 Nothing.
6873560 6876120 Get in here and get dressed.<br />What are you doing?
6876200 6877872 See if my garden growed.
6878120 6879616 I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.
6879640 6880789 You got to wait.
6881040 6883759 Yeah, but it look like<br />it ain't never gonna grow, Mama. Dag!
6884280 6886794 I told you, a watched pot never boils.
6886880 6888472 This ain't even no pot, Mama.
6888560 6889616 Get in here and get dressed.
6889640 6891840 This ain't no morning<br />to be playing around, you hear me?
6892040 6893393 Yes, ma'am.
6896000 6898036 Bye, garden.
6919480 6922756 Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.
6923560 6924560 Mmm-hmm.
6925320 6926673 Is your mama home?
6928320 6930356 Mama, there's a man down here!
6931200 6932200 Mama!
6932840 6934273 Cory?
6936600 6937828 Cory.
6938680 6940352 Cory. Cory!
6940840 6944628 - Oh! Lord have mercy!<br />- Cory.
6948920 6950239 Lookee here, y'all.
6952080 6954355 Aww, looka here.
6954440 6957079 Done got all grown up.
6957160 6958798 Don't cry, Mama. What you crying about?
6958880 6961348 I'm just so glad you made it.
6961440 6963431 Hey, Lyons.<br />How you doing, Mr. Bono?
6963640 6965631 Look at you, man, look at you.
6965720 6968553 Don't he look good, Rose?<br />Got on them corporal stripes.
6968640 6970039 What took you so long?
6970120 6971216 You know how the Marines are, Mama.
6971240 6972576 They got to get<br />all their paperwork straight
6972600 6973880 before they let you do anything.
6973960 6977270 Well, I'm sure glad you made it.<br />They let Lyons come.
6977360 6978776 Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.
6978800 6980736 They don't know<br />if they're gonna let him out or not.
6980760 6982239 I talked to them a little while ago.
6982320 6984629 A corporal<br />in the United States Marines.
6984800 6986870 Your daddy knew you had it in you.
6987000 6988877 He used to tell me all the time.
6989000 6990911 Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?
6991000 6994629 Yeah, he reminds me of Troy<br />when I first met him.
6995640 6997153 Ah, say, Rose,
6997240 6999549 Lucille's down at the church<br />with the choir.
6999680 7001511 I'm gonna go get<br />the pallbearers lined up.
7001640 7002834 I'll be back to get you all.
7003080 7004308 Thanks, Jim.
7004400 7005400 See you, Mr. Bono.
7005960 7007552 Mmm-mmm-mmm.
7009520 7012592 Cory, look at Raynell.
7012680 7013715 Ain't she precious?
7013800 7015400 She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.
7015520 7017056 Say hello to your brother.<br />This your brother, Cory.
7017080 7019435 - You remember Cory?<br />- No, ma'am.
7019520 7020656 Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.
7020680 7023240 Oh, well, we talk about you.<br />She heard us talk about you.
7023840 7026354 This is your brother, Cory.<br />Say hello.
7026440 7027759 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
7027840 7029068 So, you're Raynell.
7029280 7030280 Mmm-hmm.
7030360 7031600 Mama's told me a lot about you.
7032760 7035056 Come on, let me fix you some breakfast.<br />Keep up your strength.
7035080 7036149 I ain't hungry, Mama.
7036360 7039113 You can fix me something, Rose.<br />I'll be in there in a minute.
7039200 7040696 You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?
7040720 7042278 I know they ain't feeding you right.
7042360 7043816 No, Mama, thanks.<br />I don't feel like eating.
7043840 7044909 I'll get something later.
7046160 7048833 Raynell, get up there<br />and get that dress on like I told you.
7060120 7063237 I always knew you was gonna<br />make something out of yourself.
7064960 7067474 Your head was always<br />in the right direction.
7070480 7071549 So,
7073240 7074958 you gonna stay in?
7075040 7077315 Make it a career?<br />Put in your 20 years?
7077720 7081315 I don't know.<br />I got six already. I think that's enough.
7081400 7084995 Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.
7085080 7086911 Ain't nothing out here.
7088480 7091313 I guess Rose told you<br />about what happened with me.
7093840 7096559 They got me down at the workhouse.
7096640 7099359 I thought I was being slick<br />cashing other people's checks.
7100680 7102432 How much time you doing?
7103280 7105748 They give me three years.
7105840 7108991 I got that beat now.<br />I ain't got but nine more months.
7114360 7116749 It ain't so bad.
7116880 7119838 You learn to deal with it<br />like anything else.
7122120 7124080 "You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights,"
7124160 7127357 that's what Papa used to say.
7127440 7131035 He used to say that when he struck out.
7131120 7133315 I seen him strike out<br />three times in a row,
7133400 7137632 and the next time up,<br />he hit the ball over the grandstand.
7137720 7140678 Right out there in Homestead Field.
7141320 7145108 He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.<br />He wanted to hit it over everything.
7146640 7148312 Then after the game,
7149880 7154396 he had 200 people standing around,<br />waiting to shake his hand.
7157800 7160394 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.
7164080 7165832 Papa was something else.
7167080 7169150 You still playing?
7169240 7170912 Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.
7171840 7174070 We got some fellas down there.<br />We got us a band.
7174160 7177152 We gonna try to stay together<br />when we get out, but...
7177240 7178309 Yeah.
7179840 7181910 I'm still playing.
7182520 7184096 Still helps me get out of bed<br />in the morning.
7184120 7185314 As long as it do that,
7185400 7188836 I'm gonna stick with it,<br />try to make some sense out of it.
7188920 7191434 Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.
7193920 7195831 Let me get in here<br />and get these eggs, man.
7195920 7197956 Get ready to go bury Papa.
7203960 7205279 How you doing?
7206960 7208359 You doing all right?
7226200 7227474 Hi.
7227560 7228959 Hi.
7229960 7231473 You used to sleep in my room?
7232760 7234751 Yeah, that used to be my room.
7235320 7238232 That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."
7240560 7242471 Got your football in the closet.
7242640 7245632 Raynell. Get up there, get dressed,<br />and put them good shoes on.
7245840 7248070 Mama, can I just wear these?<br />Them others hurt my feet!
7248160 7250096 Well, they're just gonna have<br />to hurt your feet for a while.
7250120 7251256 You ain't said they hurt your feet
7251280 7252656 when you went down<br />to the store and got 'em.
7252680 7254830 They didn't hurt then.<br />My feet done got bigger.
7254920 7256478 Don't give me no back talk!
7256600 7259398 Get up there, get dressed,<br />and put them good shoes on.
7327080 7329913 Ain't too much changed.
7330000 7332639 He still got that rag tied to the tree.
7335920 7337911 He was out here swinging that bat.
7339480 7342313 I was just getting ready<br />to go back in the house.
7343600 7346319 He swung that bat and just fell over.
7348840 7352674 Seem like, when he swung it,<br />he stood there with this grin on his face.
7358600 7360272 Then he just fell over.
7363120 7364736 They carried him<br />down there to the hospital,
7364760 7366876 but I knew there wasn't no need.
7369440 7372989 - Why don't you come on in the house?<br />- Mama, I got something to tell you.
7374360 7377511 I don't know how to tell you this,<br />but I got to tell you.
7377640 7379631 I'm not going to Papa's funeral.
7382040 7385794 Boy, hush your mouth.
7385880 7387871 That's your daddy you talking about!
7388120 7390160 I don't want to hear<br />that kind of talk this morning.
7390240 7391639 I done raised you to come to this?
7391720 7393096 You standing there<br />all healthy and grown,
7393120 7394936 talking about<br />you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?
7394960 7397155 - Mama, listen...<br />- I don't want to hear it, Cory!
7397240 7398616 Just get that thought out of your head.
7398640 7401279 I've got to say no to him.<br />One time in my life, I got to say no.
7401360 7402873 I don't got to listen to that!
7402960 7404616 Now, I know you and your daddy<br />ain't seen eye to eye,
7404640 7408076 but I don't have to listen<br />to that kind of talk this morning.
7408160 7410720 Disrespecting your daddy<br />ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.
7410840 7412616 You gotta find some way<br />to come to that on your own.
7412640 7415108 Not going to your daddy's funeral<br />ain't gonna make you a man.
7418160 7421072 The whole time I was growing up,<br />living in his house,
7421160 7424072 Papa was like a shadow<br />that followed you everywhere.
7424840 7428071 It weighed on you,<br />and it sunk into your flesh.
7428760 7430716 It would wrap around you and lay there
7430800 7433234 until you couldn't tell<br />which one was you anymore.
7433360 7437512 That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!
7437600 7439909 Trying to crawl in.<br />Trying to live through you.
7440840 7445516 Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson<br />staring right back at me.
7445600 7448751 Hiding under the bed, in the closet.
7448840 7451877 I'm just saying I got to find a way<br />to get rid of that shadow, Mama.
7451960 7454190 You just like him.<br />You got him in you good.
7454280 7456656 - Don't tell me that, Mama.<br />- You Troy Maxson all over again.
7456680 7459194 I don't want to be Troy Maxson!
7460520 7462112 I just want to be me.
7462200 7465112 You can't be nobody<br />but who you are, Cory.
7465200 7468272 That shadow wasn't nothing<br />but you growing into yourself.
7468480 7470496 You either got to grow into it,<br />or cut it down to fit you,
7470520 7472795 but that's all you got to make a life with.
7472880 7476873 That's all you got to measure yourself<br />against the world out there.
7477880 7480792 Your daddy wanted you to be<br />everything he wasn't,
7480880 7482393 and at the same time,
7482480 7485233 he wanted you to be everything he was.
7485560 7487278 Now, I don't know<br />if he was right or wrong,
7487360 7488475 but I do know
7488560 7491552 he meant to do more good<br />than he meant to do harm.
7493560 7496393 Sometimes, when he touched,<br />he bruised,
7497160 7500436 and sometimes,<br />when he took me in his arms, he cut.
7507240 7509390 When I first met your daddy,
7510320 7511753 I thought,
7512000 7515072 "Here is a man<br />I can lay down with and make a baby."
7518680 7521592 That's the first thing<br />I thought when I seen him.
7521680 7523989 I thought, "Rose Lee,
7524680 7526796 "here's a man<br />you can open yourself up to
7526880 7529075 "and be filled to bursting!
7530600 7535355 "Here's a man that can<br />fill up all them empty spaces
7535440 7538079 "you been tipping around the edges of."
7543360 7546352 When your daddy<br />walked through the house,
7546440 7548112 he was just
7549280 7551635 so big.
7553360 7555032 He filled it up!
7557560 7560393 That was my first mistake.
7560480 7562789 Not to make him<br />leave some room for me.
7563320 7565072 But
7567400 7569868 I wanted a house I could sing in.
7571320 7574551 And that's what your daddy gave me.
7574640 7578713 I didn't know to keep up his strength,<br />I had to give up little pieces of mine.
7580560 7583916 I took on his life as mine<br />and mixed up the pieces,
7584000 7586992 so you couldn't hardly tell<br />which was which.
7589840 7592991 It was my choice. My life.
7593080 7596072 And I didn't have to live it like that,
7598160 7600296 but that's what life offered me<br />in the way of being a woman,
7600320 7601514 and I took it.
7603680 7606513 I grabbed it with both hands.
7606600 7609672 And by the time<br />Raynell came into the house...
7614680 7619037 I didn't want to make my blessings<br />off of nobody's misfortune,
7620880 7623952 but I took on to Raynell like she was
7624040 7627191 all them babies I wanted and never had.
7629440 7632432 Like I'd been blessed<br />to relive a part of my life.
7635560 7638711 And if the Lord see fit<br />to keep up my strength,
7640800 7644793 I'm gonna do her exactly<br />how your daddy did you.
7648400 7651153 I'm gonna give her<br />the best of what's in me.
