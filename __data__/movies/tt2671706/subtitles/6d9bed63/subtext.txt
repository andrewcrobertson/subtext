68160 70959 - <i>Troy, you ought to stop that lying.</i><br />- <i>I ain't lying.</i>
71040 72759 <i>Nigger had a watermelon this big,</i>
72840 74719 <i>talking about,<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>
74800 77479 <i>I'd like to fell out.<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>
77680 79359 And it sitting there, big as life.
79440 81557 - What Mr. Rand say?<br />- He ain't said nothing.
81640 84235 He figure, if the nigger was too dumb to<br />know he's carrying a watermelon,
84320 86118 he wasn't going to get<br />much sense out of him.
86200 88999 Trying to hide that great, big,<br />old watermelon under his coat.
89080 91595 Afraid to let the white man<br />see him carry it home.
92040 94475 I'm like you.<br />I ain't got no time for them kinda people.
94560 96074 Now, what he look like getting mad
96200 98157 'cause he seen the man from the union<br />talking to Mr. Rand?
98240 101472 He come up to me, talking about<br />"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."
101560 103756 I told him, "Get away from me with that."
103840 106309 He walked away from me<br />calling you a troublemaker.
106680 108353 What Mr. Rand say?
108440 110113 He ain't said nothing. Told me to go down
110200 111998 to the Commissioner's office next Friday.
112360 113680 They called me down there to see them.
113800 117190 Well, as long as you got your<br />complaint filed, they can't fire you.
117280 118600 That's what one of them<br />white fellas tell me.
118720 119915 I ain't worried about them firing me.
120000 122276 What, they gonna fire me<br />'cause I asked a question?
122360 123430 That's all I did.
123560 125597 I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.
125680 126670 I asked him, "Why?
126760 128956 "Why you got all the white mens driving,<br />and the colored lifting?"
129040 130952 Told him, "What's the matter?<br />Don't I count?
131040 133032 "Think only white fellows<br />got sense enough to drive a truck?"
133120 135396 "Hell, that ain't no paper job.<br />Anybody can drive a truck.
135480 137676 "How come you got all the whites driving<br />and the colored lifting?"
140400 143074 He told me, "Take it to the union."<br />Well, hell, that's what I done.
143160 145311 Now they want to come up<br />with this pack of lies.
145400 147835 I told Brownie if the man<br />come and ask him any questions,
147960 149235 just tell the truth.
149320 152276 Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up<br />on you 'cause you filed a complaint on.
152360 153635 Brownie ain't got that much sense.
153720 154915 Man wasn't thinking about nothing.
155000 156832 All I want them to do<br />is change the job description,
156920 158559 give everybody a chance<br />to drive the truck.
160560 163234 Brownie can't see that.<br />He ain't got that much sense.
184400 185720 How you figure he be making out
185800 188235 with that gal,<br />be up in Taylors' all the time?
188320 190039 - That Alberta gal?<br />- Who?
190120 191440 Brownie.
191520 193910 Same as you and me,<br />getting about as much as we is.
194000 196469 - Which is to say nothing.<br />- It is, huh?
196560 199075 Well, I figure<br />you doing a little better than me.
199160 200719 And I ain't saying what I'm doing!
201040 202679 Nigger, look here. I know you.
202760 204717 If you had gotten anywhere near that gal,
204800 207031 20 minutes later,<br />you'd be looking to tell somebody.
207120 208520 And the first one you gonna want to tell,
208600 210557 that you gonna want to brag to<br />is going to be me.
210640 213030 I ain't saying that.
213120 215157 I see where you be eyeing her.
215240 217630 I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.
217720 219916 Don't never let nobody tell you<br />Troy Maxson don't eye the women.
220000 221320 Hey, you been doing more than eyeing her.
221400 222595 You done bought her a drink or two.
222680 224000 Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink.<br />What that mean?
224080 225275 I bought you one, too.
225360 226999 What that mean, 'cause I buy her a drink?
227120 229476 - I'm just being polite.<br />- It's all right to buy her one drink.
229560 231279 That's what you call being polite.
231360 233079 But when you want to be<br />buying two or three,
233160 234560 that's what you call eyeing her.
234640 236313 Look here. As long as you've known me,
236400 238278 you ever known me to chase after women?
238360 242070 Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.<br />You're forgetting, I knew you when.
242160 244914 I'm talking about<br />since I been married to Rose.
245000 246400 Not since you been married to Rose.
246480 249678 - That's the truth, though. I can say that.<br />- All right then. Case closed.
250320 253040 I see you be walking up<br />around Alberta's house.
253120 255919 You supposed to be at Taylors',<br />and you be walking up around there.
256000 257070 What you watching where I'm walking for?
257160 258310 I don't be watching after you.
258400 260312 No, I seen you walking<br />around there more than once.
260400 261754 Hell, you liable<br />to see me walking anywhere.
261840 263797 That don't mean nothing 'cause<br />you seen me walking around there.
263880 265075 Where'd she come from, anyway?
265200 266429 She just kinda showed up one day.
266520 269831 Tallahassee. You can look at that<br />and tell she one of them Florida gals.
269920 272151 They got some big,<br />healthy women down there.
272240 274072 Grow them right up out of the ground.
274160 275719 She got a little bit of Indian in her.
275800 277678 Most of them niggers in Florida<br />got some Indian in them.
277760 279797 Yeah, I don't know about that Indian part,
279880 282839 but she damn sure big and healthy.
282920 284957 Woman wears some big stockings.
285040 289193 Got them crazy big legs,<br />and hips wide as the Mississippi River.
289280 290760 Legs don't mean nothing.
290840 292433 You don't do nothing<br />but push 'em out of the way.
292560 294119 But them hips,
294200 297159 - they cushion the ride.<br />- Troy, you ain't got no sense!
297240 300233 It's the truth.<br />Like you riding on Goodyears!
303400 305357 What you all out here getting into?
305440 307716 What you worried about<br />what we getting into for, woman?
307800 308836 This is men talk.
308920 310240 What I care<br />what you all are talking about?
310320 311674 Bono, you gonna stay for supper?
311760 313080 No, thank you, Rose,
313160 315436 but Lucille say she cooking up<br />a pot of pigfeet.
315520 317557 Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.
317640 319996 I might even stay the night,<br />you got some pigfeet.
320080 321878 You got something in there<br />to top them pigfeet, Rose?
321960 324191 I'm cooking up some chicken.<br />I got some chicken and collard greens.
324280 325475 Well, you go on back in the house.
325560 326880 Let me and Bono<br />finish what we talking about.
326960 329680 This is men talk.<br />I got some talk for you later.
329760 331752 And you know what kind of talk<br />I mean, too.
331840 333320 You go on in there and powder it up.
333400 334800 Troy, stop it!
336080 337673 Woman, come here.
338960 341156 Look here, Bono.
341240 343675 When I first met this woman,
343760 345558 I got out that place.
345640 348599 <i>Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare</i>
348680 351320 <i>There's a woman out there for me somewhere</i>
351400 355314 I looked at here, looked at there,<br />saw Rose, and I latched on to her.
355400 358791 I latched on to her and I told her...<br />Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.
359080 363359 I latched on to her and told her,<br />"Baby, I don't want to marry.
363440 365079 "I just want to be your man."
365160 367595 Rose told me...<br />Tell him what you told me, Ro.
367720 369518 I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,
369600 371831 then move out of the way,<br />so the marrying kind could find me.
371920 374355 That's what she told me,<br />"Nigger, you in my way.
374440 375760 "You blocking the view.
375840 377797 "Move out the way,<br />so I can find me a husband."
377880 380315 - I thought it over 2-3 days.<br />- Two-three days, nothing.
380440 381874 You was back the same night.
381960 384111 I come back, told her, "Okay, baby,
384200 385998 "but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster
386080 387719 "and put him out there in the backyard.
387800 389234 "And when he see a stranger come,
389320 390720 "he gonna flap his wings and crow."
390800 392871 Look here, Bono. I done<br />watched that front door by myself.
392960 395714 It was that back door I was worried about.
395800 398235 Don't talk like that!<br />Troy, you're not but telling a lie.
398560 402634 Only thing was, we first got married,<br />forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.
402720 403870 I hear you tell it.
403960 406350 Me and Lucille was staying<br />down there on Logan Street.
406440 408909 Had two rooms<br />with the outhouse in the back.
409000 410593 I ain't mind the outhouse none.
410720 413189 But when that goddamn wind<br />blew through there in the winter,
413280 414999 that's what I'm talking about!
415320 419200 To this day, I wonder why the hell I ever<br />stayed down there for six long years.
419280 421749 But, see,<br />I didn't know I could do no better.
421840 424560 I thought only white folks<br />had inside toilets and things.
424640 425835 A lot of folks don't think
425920 427479 they can do no better<br />than they're doing now.
427560 430678 Just something you gotta learn.<br />A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.
430760 432353 Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.<br />She got fresh food.
432440 434272 I ain't said nothing about<br />if she got fresh food.
434360 435680 I'm talking about what she charge.
435760 437638 She charges 10 cents more than the A&P.
437720 439279 A&P ain't never done nothing for me.
439360 441192 I spend my money where I'm treated right.
441280 442600 I go down to Bella, say,
442680 445115 "I need a loaf of bread, I'll pay you<br />Friday," she gives it to me.
445200 447032 What sense that make when I got money
447120 448440 to spend it somewhere else
448520 450113 and ignore the person<br />who done right by me?
450200 451236 That ain't in the Bible.
451320 452595 We ain't talking about<br />what's in the Bible.
452720 454871 What sense it make to shop there<br />when she overcharges?
454960 456440 Well, you do your shopping<br />where you want to,
456560 458074 I do my shopping<br />where people been good to me.
458160 460117 I don't think it's right for her<br />to overcharge, that's all.
460200 461350 Look here, I got to be getting on.
461480 462880 Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.
463000 464559 Where you going, nigger?<br />We ain't finished this pint.
464640 465756 Come here finish this pint.
465920 469800 Well, hell, I am,<br />if you ever turn the bottle loose.
469880 474238 Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,<br />I'm glad Cory got that job down there.
474520 476113 Help him with<br />his school clothes and things.
476200 478510 Gabe done moved out,<br />things getting tight around here.
478600 479829 He got that job,
479920 481479 he can start to look out for himself.
481560 484792 Cory done got recruited<br />by a college football team.
484920 488038 I told that boy about<br />that college football stuff.
488120 490919 The white man ain't gonna let<br />him get nowhere with that football.
491000 492992 I told him<br />when he first come to me with it.
493080 495675 Now, you come telling me<br />he done got more tied up in it.
495760 497831 He ought to get recruited<br />in how to fix cars,
497920 499115 or some way he can make a living.
499240 501630 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
501720 503712 It's just something the boys in school do.
503800 505917 They're gonna send a recruiter by<br />to talk to you. He'll tell you.
506000 507992 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
508080 509594 It's an honor to be recruited.
509680 512115 It ain't gonna get him nowhere,<br />Bono'll tell you that.
512440 515478 If he be like you in sports,<br />he gonna be all right.
515560 518029 Ain't but two men ever played<br />baseball good as you.
518160 520197 That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.
520280 522431 Them the only two men ever<br />hit more home runs than you.
522520 524796 And what it ever get me?<br />I ain't got a pot to piss in,
524920 526195 or a window to throw it out of.
526280 528033 Times have changed since<br />you were playing baseball, Troy.
528120 530157 That was before the war.<br />Times have changed a lot since then.
530240 531310 How the hell they done changed?
531400 532914 They got a lot of colored boys<br />playing ball now.
533000 534354 Baseball and football.
534440 537478 You right about that, Ro.<br />Times have changed, Troy.
537560 538914 You just come along too early.
539000 542676 There ought not never have been<br />no time called "too early."
544200 546431 Now you take that fellow...
546520 549194 What's that fellow they had playing<br />right field back then for the Yankees?
549280 550350 You remember who I'm talking about, Bono,
550440 551396 played right field for The Yankees.
551480 553119 - Selkirk?<br />- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!
553240 556551 Man's batting 269, you understand? 269!
556640 560350 What sense that make?<br />I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!
560440 563433 He's batting 269,<br />playing right field for the Yankees!
563520 565637 I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.
565720 568394 She's running around<br />with raggedy shoes on her feet.
568480 570039 I bet you<br />Selkirk's daughter ain't running around
570120 571918 with no raggedy shoes on her feet.<br />I bet you that.
572000 573832 They got a lot of<br />colored baseball players now.
573920 575070 Jackie Robinson was the first.
575160 576594 Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.
576720 579918 I done seen 100 niggers play baseball<br />better than Jackie Robinson.
580000 582913 Hell, I seen some teams<br />Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!
583000 584275 What you talking about, Jackie Robinson?
584360 586033 Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!
586120 587520 I'm talking about if you could play ball,
587600 588920 then they ought to let you play.
589000 590195 Don't matter what color you are.
590280 591919 Telling me I come along too early.
592000 595277 If you can play,<br />then they ought to let you play.
595360 599195 You gonna drink yourself to death.<br />You don't need to be drinking like that.
600200 601759 Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,
601840 604150 I done wrestled with him.<br />You can't tell me nothing about death.
604240 607517 Death ain't nothing<br />but a fastball on the outside corner,
607600 611435 and you know what I do with that.<br />Look here, Bono, am I lying?
611520 614354 You get one of them fastballs<br />about waist high
614440 616033 on the outside corner of the plate
616120 617839 where you can get<br />the meat of the bat on it,
617920 621152 and, good God, you could kiss it good-bye.
621240 623197 - Am I lying?<br />- No, you telling the truth.
623360 624794 I seen you do it.
624880 630000 If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.<br />That's all death is to me.
630080 632515 A fastball on the outside corner.
632600 634910 I don't know why you want to<br />get on talking about death?
635000 636320 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with talking about death.
636400 638119 That's a part of life!<br />Everybody gonna die.
638240 639515 You gonna die. I'm gonna die.
639600 641398 Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.
641480 643836 But you ain't got to talk about it.<br />I don't like talking about it.
643920 645115 Well, you the one brought it up.
645200 646759 Me and Bono talking about baseball.
646840 648797 You come telling me<br />I'm gonna drink myself to death.
648880 650155 Ain't that right, Bono?
650240 652471 Now you know I drink just<br />but one night out the week,
652560 653710 that's Friday night.
653840 655513 I drink just enough to where<br />I can handle it.
655600 657114 Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.
657200 659237 So, you ain't got to worry<br />about me drinking myself to death
659360 660919 'cause I ain't worrying about death.
661000 663674 I done seen him, done wrestled with him.
663760 665035 Look here, Bono.
665120 668272 I look up one day,<br />and Death is marching straight at me,
668360 670477 like soldiers on parade.
670560 672916 The Army of Death<br />was marching straight at me.
673000 676357 It was the middle of July, 1941.
676440 678671 And it got real cold, just like it be winter.
678760 680353 And it seemed like Death, himself,
680440 682477 reached out<br />and touched me on the shoulder.
682560 685837 He touched me like I touch you now.<br />I got cold as ice.
685920 687195 Death standing there, grinning at me.
687280 688999 Troy, why don't you hush that talk.
689080 692357 I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?<br />You be wanting me?
692440 694318 "You done sent your army<br />to be getting me?"
694400 695356 I looked him dead in the eye.
695440 696510 I wasn't fearing nothing.
696600 699274 I was ready to tangle,<br />just like I'm ready to tangle now!
699640 701518 Bible says be ever vigilant.
701600 703910 So, I don't get but so drunk.<br />I got to keep watch.
704000 705593 Troy was right down there<br />at Mercy Hospital.
705680 707034 You remember he had that pneumonia,
707120 709032 laying there with a fever,<br />talking plumb out his head.
709120 710395 And Death standing there, staring at me,
710520 711920 carrying that sickle in his hand.
712000 717758 Finally, he say, "You want to be<br />bound over for another year?"
717840 719991 Just like that. He say,
720080 723869 "You want to be bound over<br />for another year?"
723960 727954 I said, "Bound over, hell!<br />We can settle this right now."
728080 731471 He kinda fell back when I said that.<br />And all the cold went out of me.
731560 733552 I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.
733760 735433 I threw it as far as I could throw it,
735520 737193 and me and him commenced to wrestling.
737280 740796 We wrestled for... Carry the six...<br />Three days and three nights!
740880 743190 Now, I don't know<br />where I got the strength from,
743280 744999 'cause every time<br />he tried to get the best of me,
745080 749199 I reached way deep down inside myself,<br />found the strength to do him one better.
749280 750873 Every time Troy tells that story,
750960 752189 he find different ways to tell it,
752280 753760 different things to make up.
753840 755240 I ain't making up nothing, woman.
755320 756879 I'm telling you<br />the facts of what happened.
756960 759236 I wrestled with Death<br />for three days and three nights,
759360 761795 and I'm standing here<br />to tell you about it.
764120 766157 All right. At the end of the third night,
766240 769312 we done weakened each other<br />to where we can't even hardly move.
769400 770390 Death stood up.
770480 772676 He threw on that robe,<br />had a white robe with a hood on it.
772800 776077 He throwed on that robe<br />and went off to look for that sickle.
776160 779836 He said, "I'll be back."<br />Just like that. "I'll be back."
779920 783038 I said, "Yeah?<br />Well, you gonna have to find me!"
783120 784236 I wasn't no fool.
784720 786120 I wasn't going looking for him.
786200 788760 I know Death ain't nothing to play with.<br />And I know he's gonna get me.
788840 791878 I know I got to join his army,<br />his camp followers.
791960 794839 But as long as I keep up my strength<br />and see him coming,
794920 798800 as long as I keep up my vigilance,<br />he gonna have to fight to get me.
798880 800155 I ain't going easy.
800560 804236 Well, look here,<br />since you got to keep up your vigilance,
804320 805754 let me have the bottle.
805840 807752 Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.
807840 808956 I should have left out that part.
809040 810520 Troy be talking all that stuff.
810600 812956 Half the time, he don't even know<br />what he be talking about!
813080 815037 - Yeah, Bono know me better than that.<br />- That's right, I know you.
815120 818318 I know you got some<br />Uncle Remus in your blood.
818400 820676 You got more stories<br />than the devil got sinners.
820760 823355 Hell, I done seen him, too.<br />Done talked to the devil.
823440 825079 Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!
827960 829155 Hey, Pop.

840120 841759 Troy, leave your boy alone.<br />He come by to see you
841840 843354 and you want to start all that nonsense.

856160 857958 No, Rose, thanks.<br />I just was in the neighborhood
858040 859440 and thought I'd stop by for a minute.
859520 861000 Yeah, you was<br />in the neighborhood all right.
861080 862355 Nigger, you telling the truth there.
862440 864193 You was in the neighborhood<br />'cause it's my payday.
864280 866511 Well, hell, since you mentioned it,<br />let me have $10.
867240 870358 I'll be damned. I'll die and go to hell
870440 872909 and play blackjack with the devil<br />before I give you $10.
873000 875879 That's what I want to know about,<br />that devil you done seen.
875960 878111 Pop done seen the devil?<br />You too much, Pop.
878200 880431 - Yeah, I done seen him.<br />- He ain't seen no devil.
880520 882637 I told him that man<br />ain't had nothing to do with the devil.
882720 884791 Anything he can't understand,<br />he want to call it the devil.
884880 888078 Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's<br />to get some furniture.
888160 890959 You got three rooms for $298.<br />That what it say on the radio.
891040 894397 "Three rooms, $298."<br />He made up a little song about it.
894480 897473 I get down there,<br />man tell me I can't get no credit.
897560 899791 I'm working every day,<br />can't get no credit.
899880 900996 What to do?
901120 902793 I got an empty house<br />with some raggedy furniture.
902920 904036 Cory ain't got no bed.
904120 906237 He's sleeping on a pile of rags<br />on the floor.
906320 908357 Working every day, can't get no credit.
908440 909840 I come back here, Rose'll tell you,
909920 911798 madder than hell,<br />trying to figure out what to do.
912120 913236 Come a knock on the door.
913320 915357 I ain't been living but three days,<br />who know I'm here?
915480 917597 I open the door. Devil standing there.
917680 918716 Bigger than life.
918800 920678 White fella,<br />got on good clothes and everything.
920760 921910 Standing there<br />with a clipboard in his hand.
922000 923275 Now, I ain't got to say nothing.
923400 924834 First words come out of his mouth,
924920 927754 "I understand you need some furniture<br />and can't get no credit."
927840 931311 I liked to fell over. He said,<br />"I'll give you all the credit you want,
931400 933392 "but you gonna have to pay<br />the interest on it."
933480 934914 Now, I told him,<br />he give me them three rooms,
935000 936480 he can charge whatever he want.
936560 938199 Next day, a truck pull up here,
938280 939919 two men unload them three rooms.
940040 942236 Man what drove the truck give me a book.
942320 945757 Said first of the month,<br />send $10 to the address in the book,
945880 946950 everything'll be fine.
947040 948520 Said if you miss a payment,
948600 951274 the devil was coming back,<br />and there'll be hell to pay.
951360 952874 That was 15 years ago.
952960 956476 To this day, first day of every month,<br />I send my $10,
956600 957954 just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.
958040 960874 - Troy lying.<br />- I ain't never seen that man since.
960960 962838 Now, you tell me,<br />who else that gonna be but the devil?
962920 964991 And I ain't sold my soul<br />or nothing like that.
965080 967800 No, I wouldn't have truck with the devil<br />over nothing like that.
967880 971476 But I got my furniture.<br />And I send my $10, just like clockwork.
971560 974439 How long you say<br />you been paying this $10 a month?
974520 975556 15 years.
975640 979316 Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?<br />How much the man done charge you?
979400 982632 Hell, I done paid for it.<br />I done paid for it 10 times over.
982720 983995 Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.
984080 986515 Troy lying.<br />We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.
986600 988319 He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.
988400 990676 Hell, woman,<br />Bono know I ain't that big a fool.
990800 993315 I was just getting ready to say,<br />I know where there's a bridge for sale.
993400 994470 I'll tell you this.
994560 996313 It don't matter to me if it was the devil.
996400 997754 It don't matter if the devil give credit.
997840 999752 - Somebody got to give it.<br />- It ought to matter.
999840 1002116 You walking around here saying<br />you gonna make truck with the devil,
1002200 1003634 God's the one<br />you're gonna have to answer to.
1003720 1005234 He's the one gonna be at the Judgment.
1005320 1007232 Yeah, well, look here, Pop,<br />let me have that $10.
1007360 1008476 I'll give it back to you.
1008560 1009994 Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.
1010080 1011150 Bono, what did I tell you?
1011280 1012839 Only time I see this nigger<br />is when he want something.
1012920 1014070 That's the only time I see him.
1014320 1016710 Come on, Pop,<br />Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.
1016800 1018996 Let me have the $10.<br />I told you, Bonnie's working!
1019160 1020435 What that mean to me if Bonnie's working?
1020520 1023672 I don't care if she working.<br />Go ask her for $10 if she's working.
1023760 1026434 Talking about Bonnie working.<br />Why ain't you working?
1026840 1028877 Pop, you know I can't find no decent job.
1028960 1030917 Where am I gonna get a job at?<br />You know I can't get no job.
1031120 1033316 I told you, I know some people down there.

1035320 1038119 I told you that last time you<br />come back here asking for something.
1038200 1039475 No, Pop, thanks, that ain't for me.
1039600 1041080 I don't want to be carrying<br />nobody's rubbish.
1041160 1042992 I don't want to be punching<br />nobody's time clock.
1043080 1045072 What's the matter?<br />You too good to carry people's rubbish?
1045160 1047038 Where you think that $10<br />you talking about comes from?
1047120 1048873 I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish
1048960 1050838 and give my money to you<br />'cause you too lazy to work?
1050920 1052036 You're too lazy to work
1052120 1053713 and want to know<br />why you ain't got what I got.

1060720 1062120 No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.
1062240 1063720 You ain't got to be eating no beans.
1063800 1065075 I don't know why you want to say that?
1065160 1066992 I ain't got no extra money!
1068880 1070030 Gabe done moved out,
1070120 1072476 giving his money over there<br />to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.
1072560 1073755 Things done got tight around here.
1073840 1075320 I can't afford to be<br />giving you every payday.
1075400 1078040 I ain't asked you to give me nothing.<br />I asked you to loan me $10.
1078120 1079190 I know you got $10.
1079280 1081397 Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?
1081480 1083756 'Cause I don't throw my money away<br />on them streets.
1083840 1085877 You want to live the fast life,<br />being a musician,
1085960 1087599 running around in them clubs and things,

1098680 1100353 You still trying to get<br />something for nothing.
1100440 1101590 Life don't owe you nothing.
1101680 1104275 You owe it to yourself.<br />Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.
1104360 1106795 You got your way of<br />dealing with the world, I got mine.
1106880 1108678 Only thing that matters to me<br />is the music.
1109040 1111111 Yeah, I can see that.<br />Don't matter how you gonna eat,

1122200 1123350 I just stay with my music
1123440 1125591 'cause that's the only way<br />I can find to live in the world.
1125680 1128275 Otherwise, ain't no telling<br />what I might do.
1128360 1131239 I don't come by<br />criticizing you and how you live.
1131560 1133279 I just come by to ask you for $10.
1133400 1135471 I don't want to hear all that about<br />how I live.
1135560 1137995 Boy, your mama did<br />a hell of a job raising you.
1138080 1140754 You can't change me, Pop.<br />I'm 34 years old.
1141560 1142755 If you wanted to change me,
1142840 1144593 you should have been there<br />when I was growing up.
1145080 1147470 I come by to see you, ask you for $10,
1147560 1150314 and you want to talk about<br />how I was raised?
1150400 1153916 You don't know nothing<br />about how I was raised.
1159440 1161830 Let the boy have $10, Troy.
1166200 1169113 Hell you looking at?<br />You know I ain't got no money.
1169200 1171032 You know what I do with my money.

1179280 1181192 There it is.
1181280 1183317 Seventy six dollars and twenty-two cents.
1183840 1186674 You see this, Bono?<br />I ain't gonna get but six of that back.
1186760 1189753 He ought to stop telling that lie.<br />Here, Lyons.

1197960 1200111 Wait a minute.<br />You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose,"
1200200 1202032 but you ain't gonna look to see<br />where she got that money from.
1202120 1204237 - You see how they do me, Bono?<br />- I know she got it from you, Pop.
1204320 1206676 - Thanks. I'll give it back to you.<br />- There you go, telling another lie.
1206760 1208991 Time I see that $10,<br />you'll be owing me $30 more.
1209080 1210958 - See you, Mr. Bono.<br />- Take care, Lyons.
1211720 1214110 Thanks, Pop. I'll see you again.
1215560 1218553 I don't know why that boy don't go<br />and get him a decent job
1218640 1219915 and take care of that woman he got.
1220000 1222515 He'll be all right, Troy.<br />The boy is still young!
1222760 1226231 - The boy is 34 years old.<br />- Let's not get off into all that.
1226320 1229472 Look here, I got to go. I got to be going.<br />Lucille gonna be waiting.
1229560 1233634 See this woman, Bono? I love this woman.
1234240 1237153 I love her so much, it hurts.
1237240 1241280 I love her so much,<br />I done run out of ways of loving her,
1241360 1243591 so, I got to get back to basics.
1243840 1245433 Don't you come by my house Monday morning,
1245520 1246670 talking about time to go to work.
1246760 1248911 - 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.<br />- Troy, stop!
1249000 1252311 I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.<br />That ain't nothing but gin talk.
1252400 1254437 Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.
1254520 1256751 Don't you come by my house, nigger!
1258520 1260671 I done told you what I'm gonna be doing!
1263080 1265197 Come back on Tuesday!
1291280 1294557 <i>Jesus be a fence</i>
1295120 1297396 <i>All around me</i>
1297480 1299278 <i>Every day</i>
1304880 1306758 Good morning.
1306840 1308797 You ready for breakfast?<br />I can fix you some
1308880 1311156 soon as I finish hanging up these clothes.
1311240 1315792 I got the coffee on. That's all right.<br />I just have some of that this morning.
1317840 1320309 That 651 hit yesterday.
1320400 1323234 That's the second time this month<br />Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.
1323320 1325630 Seems like those that need the least<br />always get lucky.
1325760 1326910 Poor folks can't get nothing.
1327000 1328320 Them numbers don't know nobody.
1328400 1330551 I don't know why you fool with 'em,<br />you and Lyons both.
1330680 1332160 It's something to do.
1332240 1334516 You ain't doing nothing<br />but throwing your money away.
1334600 1336159 Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.
1336240 1337833 I just play a nickel here<br />and a nickel there.
1337920 1339434 That's two nickels you done throwed away.
1339520 1342160 Nah, I hit sometimes.<br />That makes up for it.
1342240 1343754 Always comes in handy when I do hit.
1343840 1344990 I don't hear you complaining then.
1345080 1346958 I ain't complaining now.<br />I just say it's foolish,
1347040 1350192 trying to guess out of 600 ways<br />which way the number gonna come.
1350280 1351839 If I had all the money these niggers...
1355520 1359434 You negroes throw away<br />on numbers in one week,
1359520 1362354 just one week, I'd be a rich man.
1362440 1363920 You wishing and calling it foolish
1364000 1365593 ain't gonna stop folks<br />from playing the numbers.
1365680 1367717 That's one thing for sure.
1367800 1370952 Besides, some good things<br />come from playing numbers.
1371040 1373999 Look where Pope done bought him<br />that restaurant off of numbers.
1374080 1378711 I can't stand niggers like that.<br />Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.
1378800 1381520 He running around with his shoes<br />all run-over,
1381600 1383592 bumming money for cigarettes.
1383680 1386593 All right.<br />Got lucky there, hit the numbers...
1386680 1388034 Troy, I know all about it.
1388120 1390874 Had good sense. I'll say that for him.<br />Man ain't throw his money away.
1390960 1394795 I done see niggers go through<br />$2,000 in four days.
1394880 1397395 Man built him that restaurant down there.
1397480 1398994 Fix it up real nice, too.
1399080 1400958 Then he won't let nobody come in it.
1401040 1403350 Negro go in there,<br />can't get no kind of service.
1403440 1406717 Seen a white fella go in there,<br />he orders a bowl of stew.
1406840 1409071 Pope pick all the meat<br />out of the pot for him.
1409160 1411117 Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!
1411200 1412680 Negro go in there behind him,
1412760 1414717 he ain't got nothing<br />but the potatoes and the carrots.
1414800 1416917 Talking about what numbers do for people.
1417000 1418229 You picked the wrong example there.
1418320 1420391 Ain't done nothing<br />but made a worser fool out of him
1420520 1422273 than he already was before.
1423960 1425440 Troy.
1425520 1428752 You ought to stop worrying about<br />what happened at work yesterday.
1431040 1432360 I ain't worried.
1433920 1435991 Just called me down there,<br />the Commissioner's office,
1436120 1438760 everybody's worried about them firing me.
1438840 1441719 I ain't worrying about them firing me.
1441800 1444031 You ain't got to worry about that.
1444120 1446271 Where's Cory? Cory in the house?
1449680 1451831 - Cory!<br />- He gone out.
1451920 1453673 Out? Yeah, he going out
1453760 1456639 'cause he know<br />I want him to work on this fence.
1456720 1458632 I know how he is.<br />That boy is scared of working.
1458720 1459995 He ain't done a lick of work in his life.
1460080 1461560 He had to go to football practice.
1461640 1463632 Coach wanted them<br />to get in a little extra practice
1463720 1464995 before the season start.
1465080 1466753 Yeah, I got his practice all right.
1466840 1469116 Running out of here<br />before he gets his chores done.
1469200 1470793 Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?
1470880 1471996 Don't nothing set right with you.
1472080 1474436 Go on back in there, go to bed,<br />and get up on the other side.
1474520 1475795 Why something got to be wrong with me?
1475880 1476950 I ain't said nothing wrong with me.
1477040 1478520 Well, you got something to say<br />about everything.
1478600 1480353 First, it's the numbers,<br />then it's the way the man
1480440 1482272 run his restaurant,<br />then you done got on Cory.
1482360 1483874 What's it gonna be next?
1484000 1486151 Take a look up there,<br />see if the weather suit you.
1486240 1487720 Or is it gonna be<br />how you gonna put up this fence
1487840 1489115 with the clothes hanging in the yard?
1489200 1490793 You hit the nail on the head then.

1581880 1582950 You ain't done nothing to me.
1583040 1587478 I just move over to Miss Pearl's<br />to keep out from in your way.
1587560 1588789 I ain't mean no harm by it.

1593120 1594873 You ain't mad at me, is you?
1594960 1599557 I ain't made at you, Gabe.<br />If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

1606080 1609710 I got me two rooms in the basement.<br />I got my own door, too.
1610040 1612350 You want to see my key?
1613920 1617516 That's my own key.<br />Ain't nobody else got a key like that.
1617600 1619432 That's my key for my two rooms.
1619520 1621477 That's good, Gabe.<br />Got your own key, that's good.
1621560 1622755 You hungry, Gabe?
1622840 1624479 I was just fixing to cook Troy<br />some breakfast.
1624600 1627240 I'll take some biscuits.<br />You got some biscuits?
1629200 1633080 Did you know, when I was in Heaven,<br />every morning, me and Saint Peter
1633160 1636995 would sit down by the Gate<br />and eat some big, fat biscuits?
1637080 1641472 Yeah, we had us a good time.<br />We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.
1641560 1644155 And then Saint Peter<br />would go off to sleep,
1644240 1645833 and tell me to wake him up
1645920 1648196 when it's time to open the Gates<br />for the Judgment.
1648280 1652752 Well, come on,<br />I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.
1652880 1656794 Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name<br />in his book. I seen it.
1656880 1658758 It say, "Troy Maxson."
1659040 1660918 I say, "I know him.
1661000 1664311 "He got the same name like what I got.
1664400 1666357 "That's my brother."
1667760 1670070 How many times<br />you gonna tell me that, Gabe?
1670160 1673198 Ain't got my name in the book.<br />Don't have to have my name.
1673280 1675511 I done died and went to Heaven.
1675600 1678593 But he got your name, though.
1678680 1681991 One morning,<br />Saint Peter was looking at his book,
1682080 1684754 and he was marking it up for the Judgment,
1684840 1686877 and he let me see your name.
1686960 1691830 He got it in there under "M."<br />He got Rose's name.
1691960 1695271 I ain't seen it like I seen yours,<br />but I know it's in there.
1695600 1698957 He got a great big book!
1699040 1701714 He got everybody's name<br />what was ever been born.
1701800 1703075 That's what he told me.
1703800 1706998 But I seen your name.<br />I seen it with my own eye.
1707080 1708070 Come in the house.

1733480 1735472 I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn,
1735560 1740316 so Saint Peter can hear me<br />when it's time to open the Gate.
1740480 1741914 You hear that?
1744320 1747040 You hear that? That's the hellhound.
1747120 1748793 I'm gonna chase them out of here.
1748880 1752715 Go on! Get out of here! Get out! Get out!
1755960 1758077 <i>All you hypocrite members</i>
1758560 1760472 <i>Wasting your time away</i>

1812800 1814712 He's gone off somewhere.
1817360 1818476 He ain't eating right.
1818560 1820517 Miss Pearl say<br />she can't get him to eat nothing.
1820600 1821875 What you want me to do about it, Rose?
1821960 1825397 I did everything I could for the man.<br />I can't make him get well.
1825480 1828678 Man got half his head blown off,<br />what you expect?
1828760 1830433 Seems like something ought to be done<br />to help him.
1830520 1831840 The man don't bother nobody.
1831920 1834276 He just mixed up<br />'cause of that metal plate
1834360 1837034 he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...
1837120 1840158 Thank you. Ain't no sense<br />in sending him to the hospital.
1840240 1841560 At least he'd be eating right.
1841640 1843040 They could help him take care of himself.
1843120 1844713 Don't nobody want to be locked up, Rose.
1844800 1846678 What you want to lock the man up for?
1846760 1848399 Man going down there,
1848480 1852679 over there and fight that war,<br />messing with them Japs,
1852760 1854433 getting half his head blown off.
1854520 1858230 They give him a lousy $3,000.<br />I got to swoop down on that.
1858320 1859640 Is you fixing to get into that again?
1859720 1861757 He got a metal plate in his head.
1861880 1863917 That's the only reason<br />I got a roof over my head
1864000 1865514 is 'cause of that metal plate.
1865600 1867432 Ain't no sense in you<br />blaming yourself for nothing.
1867520 1869716 Gabe was in no condition<br />to manage that money.
1869800 1870916 You done what was right by him.
1871000 1873037 Can't nobody say<br />you ain't done what was right by him.
1873120 1874474 Look how long you took care of him.
1874600 1877195 Till he wanted his own place<br />and moved over there with Miss Pearl.
1877280 1879795 That ain't what I'm saying, woman.<br />I'm just...
1882400 1883834 I'm just stating the facts.
1883920 1885991 If my brother<br />didn't have a metal plate in his head,
1886080 1887514 I wouldn't have a pot to piss in
1887600 1889000 or a window to throw it out of.
1889080 1890799 And I'm 53...
1900800 1902359 Where you going off to?
1902440 1904113 You been running out of here<br />every Saturday for weeks.
1904200 1907034 I thought you were gonna<br />work on this fence.
1907120 1909351 I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and...
1958880 1959870 Mama?
1961560 1964120 Cory. Your daddy<br />like to have a fit with you
1964200 1967079 running out of here this morning<br />without doing your chores.
1967160 1968435 You all right?
1968520 1971797 He say you supposed to be<br />helping him with the fence.
1971880 1973280 I told you I had to go to practice.
1973360 1975352 And he's been saying that<br />the last four or five Saturdays,
1975440 1978512 and then don't ever do nothing<br />but go down to Taylors'.
1979960 1982031 - You told him about the recruiter?<br />- Yeah, I told him.
1982120 1984760 - Well, what'd he say?<br />- He didn't say nothing too much.
1984840 1987480 Go on and get started on your chores<br />before he gets back here.
1987560 1990200 Go on and scrub down them steps
1990280 1993159 before he come back here hollering<br />and carrying on!
1993240 1995072 Go! Boy, go!

2024280 2025794 What do I care about the game?<br />Come here, woman.
2025880 2027030 I thought you went down to Taylors'
2027120 2028873 to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.
2028960 2030679 I thought you're supposed to<br />be putting up the fence.
2030760 2033116 I'll put it up when I finish with what...
2034440 2035556 Is at hand.
2035640 2037711 Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!

2135560 2137199 - $200?<br />- That ain't that much, Pop.
2137560 2139870 No, that's just $200.
2141000 2143071 You see that roof you got<br />sitting over your head at night?
2143360 2145272 Let me tell you something about that roof.
2145360 2149240 It's been 10 years<br />since that roof was last tarred.
2149320 2152438 See, now snow come this winter,<br />sit up on that roof like it is,
2152520 2154477 it's gonna seep inside,<br />just gonna be a little bit,
2154560 2156876 you ain't gonna hardly notice it,<br />then next thing you know,
2156960 2158440 it's gonna be leaking all over the house.
2158520 2162480 Then the wood rot from all that water,<br />and you gonna need a whole new roof.

2169160 2170879 While you be thinking about a TV,

2179680 2182070 I'd buy a TV.<br />And when the roof started to leak,
2182200 2183475 if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

2197560 2199233 You don't have to pay for it<br />all at one time.
2199320 2201198 You can put a down payment on it,<br />and carry it on with you.
2201280 2203954 Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing<br />if I can help it.
2204040 2206600 Miss a payment, they come<br />and snatch it right out of your house.
2206680 2209718 Then what you got? See?
2209800 2213316 Now, when I get $200 clear,<br />I'll buy me a TV.
2213440 2216797 Right now, when I get $264,<br />I'm gonna get that roof fixed.
2216880 2217870 Pop...
2217960 2220680 You go get you $200<br />and buy you a TV if you want to.
2220760 2222353 I got better things to do with my money.
2222440 2224671 I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.
2225080 2226309 All right, I'll tell you what.
2226400 2229598 You get $100,<br />I'll put the other $100 with it.
2229680 2231160 All right, I'm gonna show you.
2231240 2234472 Yeah, show me how you can<br />cut these boards right now.
2235200 2237635 There you go. That's $200 worth.
2240400 2242153 - The Pirates won today.<br />- Yeah?
2242240 2243356 That makes five in a row.
2243440 2245875 I ain't thinking about no Pirates.<br />They got an all-white team.
2245960 2249636 Got that boy, though,<br />that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?
2249960 2251030 Don't even half play him.
2251120 2253112 That boy could be something<br />if they'd give him a chance.
2253360 2255238 Play him one day,<br />sit him on the bench the next.
2255320 2256549 He gets lots of chances to play.
2256640 2258552 I'm talking about playing every day,<br />playing regular,
2258640 2260199 so you can get your timing,<br />that's what I'm talking about.
2260320 2262391 They got some white guys on the team<br />that don't play every day.
2262480 2263709 You can't play everybody at the same time.
2263800 2265598 If they got a white fellow<br />sitting on the bench,
2265680 2268320 you can bet your last dollar<br />he can't play.
2268400 2270437 Colored guy got to be twice as good<br />to get on the team.
2270520 2273319 That's why I don't want you<br />getting all tied up in them sports.
2273400 2275437 Man on the team, what it get him?
2275520 2277477 Got colored on the team,<br />don't even use him.
2277560 2280314 Same as not having them.<br />All them teams the same.
2280400 2282676 The Braves got Hank Aaron<br />and Wes Covington.
2282800 2284792 Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.<br />That makes 43.
2284880 2286837 Aaron ain't nobody.<br />That's what you supposed to do.
2286920 2288718 That's how the game's supposed<br />to be played.
2288800 2291520 Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of getting<br />your timing and follow through.
2291640 2293757 Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.
2293840 2295320 Not off no major-league pitcher,<br />you couldn't.
2295400 2296959 We had better pitching<br />in the Negro leagues.
2297040 2298793 I hit seven home runs<br />off of Satchel Paige.
2298880 2300109 You can't get no better than that.
2300200 2301873 Sandy Koufax,<br />he leading the league in strikeouts.
2301960 2303474 I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.
2303560 2305313 You got Warren Spahn<br />and Lew Burdette. I bet you...
2305400 2306629 I'm through with it now.
2310880 2313270 Go and cut them boards.
2315400 2318677 Your mama told me you got<br />recruited by a college football team.
2318760 2320080 Is that right?
2320280 2323512 Yeah, Coach Zellman say the recruiter<br />gonna be coming by to talk to you.
2323600 2325637 Get you to sign the permission papers.
2325760 2327319 I thought you was supposed to<br />be working down the A&P.
2327400 2329039 Ain't you supposed to be<br />working down there after school?
2329120 2330873 Mr. Stawicki say<br />he gonna hold my job for me
2330960 2332360 until after the football season.
2332640 2335030 He said starting next week,<br />I can work weekends.
2335120 2338033 Boy, I thought we had an understanding<br />about this football stuff.

2344080 2345355 ain't none of your chores done.
2345440 2347113 Now you come telling me<br />you done quit your job?
2347240 2349277 - I'm gonna be working weekends.<br />- You damn right you are!
2349360 2351192 And ain't no need for nobody<br />to be coming around here,
2351280 2352430 talking to me about signing nothing.
2352520 2353556 Pop, you can't do that.
2353640 2354915 He's coming all the way<br />from North Carolina.
2355040 2356872 I don't care where he coming from!
2357000 2358150 Look, boy,
2359280 2360680 the white man ain't gonna let you
2360760 2362558 get nowhere with no football no way.
2362960 2365156 Now you get your book-learning, so you can
2365280 2368193 work your way up at the A&P<br />and learn how to fix cars,
2368280 2369953 or build houses, get you a trade.
2370040 2372555 This way, you got something<br />can't nobody take away from you.
2372680 2375070 You go in and learn how to<br />put your hands to good use
2375160 2377038 besides hauling other people's garbage.
2377120 2378190 I get good grades, Pop.
2378280 2379634 That's why the recruiter<br />want to talk with you.
2379720 2381279 You got to keep up<br />your grades to get recruited.
2381360 2383192 This way, I'll be going to college,<br />I'll get a chance.
2383280 2386751 First, you get your butt down there<br />and get your job back.
2386840 2388274 Mr. Stawicki done already<br />hired somebody else
2388360 2389794 'cause I told him I was playing football.
2391440 2393272 You a bigger fool than I thought.
2393360 2395352 You gonna let somebody take away your job,
2395440 2396760 so you can play some football.
2397320 2400120 Where you gonna get your money to take<br />care of your girlfriend and whatnot?
2400200 2401554 What kind of foolishness is that
2401640 2403074 to let somebody take away your job?
2403160 2404389 I'm still gonna be working weekends.
2404480 2406551 No. You getting out of here<br />and finding you another job.
2406640 2407915 Come on, Pop. I gotta practice.
2408000 2409753 I can't work after school<br />and play football, too.
2409840 2411399 The team needs me,<br />that's what Coach Zellman say.
2411480 2413631 I don't care what nobody say.<br />I'm the boss. You understand?
2413720 2416952 I'm the boss around here.<br />I do the only saying what counts.
2417040 2419430 - Come on...<br />- I asked you, "Do you understand?"
2419560 2422439 - Yeah.<br />- What?
2422520 2425672 - Yes, sir.<br />- All right.
2425760 2428790 You get on down there to that A&P<br />and see if you can get your job back.
2428880 2431440 If you can't do both,<br />then you quit the football team.
2431520 2433637 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.
2433720 2434915 Yes, sir.
2442520 2445592 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- What the hell you got to ask me?
2445680 2448479 Mr. Stawicki the one<br />you got the questions for.
2448560 2450040 How come you ain't never liked me?
2451240 2455473 Like you?<br />Who the hell said I got to like you?
2456960 2459111 What law is there say I got to like you?
2459200 2462319 You want to stand up in front of my face<br />and ask a damn fool-ass question like that.

2463760 2465080 Come here, boy, when I talk to you.
2467440 2471719 Straighten up, God damn it!<br />I asked you a question.
2472000 2474959 - What law is there say I got to like you?<br />- None.

2478400 2479834 Answer me when I talk to you.
2479920 2480956 - Don't you eat every day?<br />- Yeah.
2481080 2482753 Nigger, as long as you in my house,
2482840 2484832 you put a "sir" on the end of it<br />when you talk to me.

2486400 2487720 - Got a roof over your head?<br />- Yes, sir.
2487800 2488995 - Got clothes on your back?<br />- Yes, sir.
2489080 2490560 - Why you think that is?<br />- 'Cause of you.
2491280 2495240 Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.<br />But why do you think that is?
2496920 2498240 'Cause you like me?
2498440 2500352 "Like" you.
2500440 2502318 I go out of here every morning,
2502400 2505711 I bust my butt putting up<br />with them crackers every day
2505800 2507519 'cause I "like" you.
2507600 2510638 You about the biggest fool I ever saw.<br />It's my job.
2510720 2512552 It's my responsibility.
2512640 2515439 A man is supposed to<br />take care of his family.
2515640 2518519 You live in my house,<br />fill your belly with my food,
2518600 2522196 put your behind on my bed<br />because you're my son.
2522280 2525079 Not 'cause I like you.<br />'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.
2525160 2527720 I owe a responsibility to you.
2527800 2529678 Now, let's get this straight<br />right here and now,
2529760 2531319 before it go along any further.
2531400 2532880 I ain't got to like you.
2532960 2536078 Mr. Rand don't give me my money<br />come payday 'cause he like me.
2536160 2539198 He give it to me 'cause he owe me.
2539680 2541319 Now I done give you everything<br />I got to give you.
2541400 2543710 I give you your life!
2543800 2545280 Me and your mama<br />worked that out between us,
2545360 2548478 and liking your black ass<br />wasn't part of the bargain.
2548680 2550080 Now don't you go through life
2550160 2552391 worrying about<br />whether somebody like you, or not.
2552480 2555552 You best be making sure<br />they're doing right by you.
2555640 2557279 - You understand what I'm saying?<br />- Yes, sir.
2557360 2560797 Then get the hell out of my face<br />and get on down to that A&P!
2584160 2586595 Why don't you go ahead<br />and let the boy play football, Troy?
2586680 2588592 He just want to be like you<br />with the sports.
2588680 2590751 I don't want him to be like me.
2590840 2592433 I want him to get as far away from my life
2592520 2593590 as he possibly can get.
2593680 2595831 You the only decent thing<br />ever happened to me, Rose.
2596360 2597794 And I wish him that.
2598360 2601512 But I don't wish him<br />nothing else from my life.
2602520 2606434 I decided 17 years ago, that boy<br />wasn't gonna get involved in no sports.
2606520 2608159 Not after<br />what they did to me in the sports.
2608240 2610471 Why don't you just admit<br />you were too old for the major leagues?
2610560 2612153 For once, why don't you just admit that?
2612240 2613913 Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.
2614000 2617232 I just wasn't the right color.<br />Hell, I'm 53 years old,
2617360 2620432 I can do better than Selkirk's .269<br />right now.
2620520 2622876 How were you gonna play ball<br />when you were over 40?
2622960 2624633 Sometimes, I can't get<br />no sense out of you.
2624720 2625790 I got good sense, woman.
2625880 2629112 I got sense enough not to let that boy<br />get hurt playing no sports.
2629200 2630714 You mothering the boy too much.
2630840 2632957 Worrying about whether people<br />"like" him or not.
2633040 2636317 Everything that boy do, he do for you.
2636400 2638960 He wants you to say, "Good job, son."<br />That's all.
2639400 2642518 I ain't got time for that, Rose.<br />He's alive, he's healthy.
2642600 2645957 He's got to make his own way. I made mine.
2646080 2648595 Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand<br />when he get out there in the world.
2648680 2651036 Times have changed, Troy.
2651120 2653191 People change.
2653280 2655556 The world changing,<br />and you can't even see it.
2662080 2664834 Woman, I do the best I can do.
2664920 2666240 I come in here every Friday,
2666320 2669154 I carry a sack of potatoes<br />and a bucket of lard.
2669240 2672836 You all line up at the door<br />with your hands out.
2672920 2676516 I give you the lint from my pockets.<br />I give you my sweat and my blood.
2676600 2679195 I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.
2679320 2681915 We go upstairs in that room at night,<br />I fall down on you
2682000 2685516 and try to blast a hole into forever.
2685600 2687831 I get up Monday morning,<br />find my lunch on the table,
2687920 2689320 go out and make my way.
2689400 2693679 Find my strength<br />to get me through to next Friday.
2693760 2695160 That's all I got, Rose.
2698280 2701079 That's all I got to give.
2705280 2706794 Can't give nothing else!
2733720 2734995 Mr. Maxson?
2737920 2740116 Commissioner will see you now.
2746920 2748274 Rose!
2751240 2752833 Hey, Ro!
2752920 2757312 I wish I could've seen Mr. Rand's face<br />when he told you.
2757440 2760194 He couldn't get it out his mouth.<br />Liked to bit his tongue.
2760280 2762192 When they called me down there<br />to the Commissioner's office,
2762320 2765074 he thought they was gonna fire me,<br />like everybody else.
2765160 2766799 I didn't think they was gonna fire you.
2766880 2769349 I thought they's gonna put you<br />on the warning paper.
2769440 2772751 Hey, Rose!<br />Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.
2772840 2774877 I see you run right down there to Taylors'
2775000 2776275 and told that Alberta gal.
2776360 2779432 Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!
2779520 2781432 I went down there to cash my check.
2782320 2783356 Hey!
2783440 2785238 Hush all that hollering.<br />I know you out here.
2785320 2787118 What they say down<br />at the Commissioner's office?
2787200 2788998 You supposed to come<br />when I call you, woman.
2789080 2790230 Bono will tell you that.
2790320 2791834 Don't Lucille come when you call her?
2791920 2793036 Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.
2793120 2794440 Talk about come when you call me.
2794560 2796074 You hear this, Bono?<br />I used to have me an old dog
2796160 2797230 get uppity like that.
2797320 2799880 You say, "Come here, Blue,"<br />he just lay there, look at you.
2799960 2802191 End up getting a stick chasin' him away,<br />trying to make him come.
2802320 2803800 I ain't studying you and your dog.
2803880 2805473 I remember you used to sing that old song.
2805720 2807871 <i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>
2808080 2809753 <i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>
2809840 2811354 Nobody wants to hear that old song.
2812320 2814073 <i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>
2814160 2816231 Used to have Cory runnin' around here<br />singin' that song.
2816320 2817993 Hell, I remember that song myself.
2818080 2820436 <i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>
2820640 2822836 <i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>
2823000 2825515 That's my daddy's song.<br />My daddy made up that song.
2825600 2828160 I don't care who made it up.<br />Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.
2828480 2829834 <i>Come here, woman!</i>
2830160 2833631 You come in here carrying on,<br />I reckon they ain't fired you.
2833720 2835677 What they say down there<br />at the Commissioner's office?
2835760 2838798 Look here, Rose.<br />Mr. Rand called me in his office
2838880 2841395 after I got back from<br />talkin' to them people down there.
2841480 2843790 He called me in his office and told me...
2845520 2846920 They was making me a driver!
2847520 2850433 - Troy, you kidding!<br />- No, I ain't. Ask Bono.
2850520 2853154 That's great, Troy. Now you don't<br />have to hassle them people no more.
2853240 2856358 Oh, hell.<br />I didn't think I was gonna see you today.
2856440 2857920 I thought you was in jail.
2858040 2860350 Got it all over the <i>Courier</i><br />about them raiding Seefus' place
2860440 2862955 where you be hanging out<br />with all them thugs.
2863040 2864679 Hey, Pop,<br />that ain't got nothing to do with me.
2864880 2866075 I don't go down there gambling.
2866160 2868038 I just go down there<br />to sit in with the band.
2868120 2870191 I ain't got nothing to do<br />with the gambling part.
2870280 2871794 They got some good music down there.
2871880 2873633 They got some rogues is what they got.
2873720 2875712 How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

2878560 2880040 How come you ain't brought<br />Bonnie like I told you?
2880120 2881110 You shoulda brought Bonnie.
2881200 2882520 She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.
2882600 2883795 I was just in the neighborhood.
2883880 2885280 - Thought I'd stop by.<br />- Here it comes.
2885400 2887596 Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.
2887680 2889990 He gonna be the first colored driver.
2890080 2892874 Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there and<br />read the paper, like them white fellas.
2892960 2895680 Hey, Pop, if you knew<br />how to read, you'd be all right.
2895760 2898275 Nah, nah. You mean<br />if the nigger knew how to drive,
2898360 2899476 he'd be all right.
2899720 2903113 Been fighting with them people about<br />driving and ain't even got a license.
2903200 2904919 Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2905000 2905990 Driving ain't nothing.
2906080 2907833 All you do is point the truck<br />where you want it to go.
2907920 2908990 Driving ain't nothing.
2909080 2910594 Do they know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2910720 2911790 That's what I'm talkin' about.
2911880 2913234 I ain't asked if driving was easy.
2913320 2915676 I asked if Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license.
2915760 2916830 The man ain't got to know my business.
2916920 2919071 Time he find out, I have<br />two or three of them driver's license.
2919160 2921038 - Say, look here, Pop.<br />- I knew it was coming.
2921120 2923032 I knew what kinda "Look here, Pop"<br />that was.
2923120 2924440 Nigger finna ask me for some money.
2924680 2926399 It's Friday night, it's my payday.
2926480 2929996 All them rogues down on the avenue,<br />the ones that ain't in jail,
2930080 2932800 and Lyons is hopping in his shoes<br />to get down there with them.
2932880 2933916 Now, see, Pop,
2934000 2936515 if you gave somebody else<br />a chance to talk sometime,
2936600 2940196 you'd see I was fixing to pay you back<br />your $10 like I told you.
2940280 2943432 Here. I told you I'd pay you<br />when Bonnie got paid.
2943520 2945716 No, you keep that $10. Put it in the bank.
2945800 2947393 Next time you feel like<br />you wanna come by here
2947480 2949119 and ask me for somethin',<br />you go down there and get that.
2949440 2950669 Here you go your $10, Pop.
2950800 2952553 I told you,<br />I don't want you to give me nothing.
2952640 2953869 I just wanted to borrow $10.
2953960 2956520 No, you keep that for the next time<br />you want to ask me.
2956800 2958120 Come on, Pop, here go your $10.
2958200 2961272 Troy, why don't you let the boy<br />pay you back?
2964120 2966680 Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,
2966760 2968717 I'm gonna hear about it<br />for the next six months.
2968800 2970439 You can hand yours over, too, Troy.
2970520 2972034 You see this, Bono?<br />You see how they do me?
2972120 2973873 Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.
2974000 2977311 <i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>
2978800 2980359 <i>Better get ready</i>
2983160 2985152 Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!
2985240 2986560 How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
2986640 2988120 Lyons!
2990080 2992436 The King of the Jungle!
2992840 2995719 Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.
2995800 2998235 I picked it myself.<br />That's the same rose like you is.
2998320 2999993 That's right nice of you, Gabe.
3000080 3001594 What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?
3001680 3005151 I been chasing hellhounds<br />and waiting for the time
3005240 3007072 to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.
3007160 3008833 You been chasing hellhounds, huh?
3008920 3010639 Well, you doing<br />the right thing, Uncle Gabe.
3010720 3013713 - Somebody's got to chase 'em.<br />- Yeah, I know it.
3013800 3016679 The devil's strong.<br />The devil ain't no pushover.
3016760 3019195 Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.
3019280 3021875 But I got my trumpet waiting<br />on the Judgment time.
3021960 3023679 Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?
3023760 3025831 Ain't gonna be too much of a battle
3025960 3029397 when God get to waving<br />that Judgment sword.
3029480 3031551 But the people's<br />gonna have a hell of a time
3031640 3034200 trying to get into Heaven<br />if them Gates ain't open.
3034280 3035794 You hear this, Pop?
3036360 3038556 - Uncle Gabe, you all right.<br />- Lyons.
3041680 3044115 - The King of the Jungle!<br />- You stayin' for supper, Gabe?
3044200 3045270 You want me to fix you a plate?
3045360 3048273 I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.<br />I don't want no plate.
3048360 3050477 I want to eat with my hands.<br />I'll take a sandwich.
3050560 3052950 What about you, Lyons? You stayin'?<br />Got some short ribs cooking.
3053040 3056511 Nah. I won't eat nothing<br />till after we finish playing.
3057160 3059152 You ought to come down,<br />listen to me play, Pop.
3059240 3061516 I don't like all that Chinese music,<br />all that noise.
3061600 3065071 Go in there and wash up, Gabe.<br />I'll fix you a sandwich.
3065160 3067800 Troy mad at me.
3067880 3069234 What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?
3069320 3072154 He think Troy mad at him 'cause<br />he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.
3072240 3074311 I ain't mad at the man.<br />He can live where he want to live at.
3074400 3076551 Well, what he move over there for?<br />Miss Pearl don't like nobody.
3076640 3078393 She don't mind him none.<br />She treat him real nice.
3078480 3079960 She just don't allow all that singing.
3080040 3082600 She don't mind that rent he be paying.<br />That's what she don't mind.
3082680 3084194 Troy, I ain't goin' through that<br />with you no more.
3084280 3086078 He moved over there<br />'cause he wanted his own place.
3086160 3087230 He can come and go as he please.
3087320 3089437 He can come and go as he please here.<br />I wasn't stoppin' him.
3089520 3090749 I wasn't putting no rules on the man.
3090840 3092593 That ain't the same thing,<br />and you know it.
3092680 3093909 Now that's the last<br />I wanna hear about that.
3094000 3096151 I don't wanna hear nothin' else<br />about Gabe and Miss Pearl.
3096280 3098920 - And next week...<br />- I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.
3099000 3101151 And next week, when<br />that recruiter come from that school,
3101240 3103914 I want you to sign that paper<br />and go on and let Cory play football.
3104000 3105719 That'll be the last<br />I have to hear about that.
3110400 3112392 Cory got recruited?<br />What school he goin' to?
3112520 3114113 I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.
3114200 3117920 Boy walking around here smelling his piss,<br />thinking he gonna do what he want to do,
3118000 3120276 irregardless of what I say.
3120360 3122636 Look here, Bono,<br />I left the Commissioner's office
3122720 3124120 and went down to the A&P.
3124200 3126396 That boy ain't workin' down there,<br />he lied to me.
3126480 3129837 Tellin' me he got his job back,<br />tellin' me he workin' weekend,
3129920 3131479 tellin' me he workin' after school.
3131560 3133791 Mr. Stawicki says<br />he ain't working down there at all.
3133880 3135075 Cory just growing up.
3135160 3137197 He just bustin' at the seams,<br />tryin' to fill out your shoes.
3137320 3138470 I don't care what he doing.
3138560 3140631 When he get to the place<br />where he want to disobey me,
3140720 3143872 then it's time for him to move on.<br />Bono will tell you that.
3143960 3147636 I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy<br />without paying the consequences.
3147720 3149996 I ain't never had the chance.
3150080 3153676 My daddy came on through,<br />but I ain't never knew him to see him.
3153760 3156355 Or what he had on his mind,<br />or where he went.
3156440 3160116 Just moving on through.<br />Searching out the New Land.
3161000 3163310 That's what the old folks used to call it.
3163400 3166837 See a fella moving around<br />from place to place, woman to woman,
3166920 3169310 they call it "Searching out the New Land."
3169400 3171039 I can't say if he ever found it.
3171800 3174269 I come along, didn't want no kids.
3174760 3176752 I didn't know if I was gonna<br />be in one place long enough
3176840 3178832 to fix on 'em right as their daddy.
3178920 3181037 I figured I was going searching, too.
3181120 3183351 As it turn out,<br />I been hooked up with Lucille
3183440 3185830 for near about as long as<br />your daddy been with Rose.
3185920 3188071 Going on 16 years.
3188160 3190038 Sometimes, I wish<br />I'd never known my daddy.
3190120 3193875 He ain't cared nothing about no kids.<br />A kid to him wasn't nothing.
3194280 3197432 All he wanted you to do<br />was learn how to walk,
3197520 3199193 so he could start you to working.
3199280 3203035 Come to eating, he ate first.<br />Anything left over, that's what you got.
3203120 3206192 Man would sit down, eat two chickens,<br />and give you the wing.
3206280 3209557 You ought to stop that, Pop.<br />Everybody feed their kids.
3209640 3212758 No matter how hard times is,<br />everybody care about their kids.
3212840 3214035 Make sure they have something to eat.
3214120 3215873 Only thing my daddy cared about
3215960 3217713 was getting them bales<br />of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.
3217800 3219837 That's the only thing<br />that mattered to him.
3219920 3222071 Sometimes, I used to wonder<br />why he was still living,
3222160 3224720 why the devil hadn't come and got him.
3224960 3226872 "Get them bales of cotton<br />in to Mr. Lubin."
3226960 3228314 Find out he owe him money.
3228400 3230596 He should have just went on and left<br />when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.
3230680 3231716 That's what I would've done.
3231800 3234713 How he gonna leave with 11 kids?<br />And where he gonna go?
3234800 3237998 He ain't knew nothing but how to farm.<br />No, he was trapped.
3238400 3241552 I think he knew it, too.<br />But I'll say this for him...
3241640 3243393 He felt a responsibility toward us.
3243480 3245472 May not have treated us<br />like I felt he should have,
3245560 3249474 but without that responsibility,<br />he could have run off and left us,
3249600 3250920 made his own way.
3251000 3252400 A lot of them did.
3252480 3254073 Back in those days,<br />what you talkin' about?
3254160 3255799 They walk out their front door
3255880 3259078 and take off down one road or another<br />and just keep on walkin'.
3259160 3261072 There you go.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
3261160 3264517 Just keep on walking<br />till they come to something else.
3264600 3267911 Ain't you never heard of nobody<br />having the walking blues?
3268000 3270469 Now, that's what you call it<br />when you just take off like that.
3271120 3274431 My daddy ain't had no walking blues.<br />What you talking about?
3274520 3276000 He stayed right there with his family,
3276840 3280754 but he was just as evil as he could be!
3280880 3284510 My mama couldn't stand him.<br />Couldn't stand that evilness.
3284600 3287593 She run off when I was about eight.
3287720 3290838 She sneaked off one night,<br />told me she was coming back for me.
3290920 3292639 I ain't never seen her no more.
3292720 3296839 All his women run off and left him.<br />He wasn't good for nobody.
3297360 3299033 My turn come to head out.
3299120 3300474 I was 14,
3300560 3303439 got to sniffing around<br />Joe Canewell's daughter.
3304800 3307110 We had this old mule called "Greyboy".
3307240 3309357 My daddy sent me out to do some plowing.
3309440 3313116 I got to fooling around<br />with Joe Canewell's daughter.
3313200 3316398 Found us a nice spot,<br />got real cozy with each other.
3316480 3319678 She was about 13,<br />so we done figured we grown anyway.
3319760 3322150 So, we were down there by<br />the creek, enjoying ourselves,
3322240 3323640 ain't thinking about nothing.
3323720 3326030 Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,
3326120 3329557 wandered back to the house,<br />and my daddy was lookin' for me.
3329840 3333311 So, we down there enjoying ourselves<br />when he come up on us.
3333400 3335471 Surprised us.
3335600 3338115 Had them leather straps off that mule,
3338200 3341238 commenced to whupping me<br />like there was no tomorrow.
3341320 3343915 I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.
3344600 3346717 I was scared of my daddy.
3346920 3348912 Now, when he commenced to whipping on me,
3349000 3350719 quite naturally,<br />I run to get out of the way.
3350800 3353474 Now, I think he's mad<br />'cause I ain't done my work.
3353560 3358191 But I see where he's chasing me off,<br />so he can have the gal for himself.
3359600 3361717 When I see what the matter of it was,
3362600 3366879 I lost all fear of my daddy,<br />and right there, I became a man.
3366960 3369350 Fourteen years of age.
3369440 3372353 Now, it's my turn to run him off.
3372440 3374238 I picked up them same reins he used on me.
3374320 3377916 I picked up them reins,<br />I commenced to whupping on him.
3378960 3381270 Gal jump up, she run off.
3383200 3384429 When he turned to face me,
3384520 3386398 I knew why the devil<br />never come and get him
3386480 3388631 'cause he was the devil himself.
3389960 3392520 I don't know what happened.
3392600 3395798 I woke up, laying there by the creek,
3395880 3399556 and Blue, this old dog we had,<br />he was licking my face.
3399640 3402678 Both my eyes were swoll shut.
3402760 3404592 I thought I was blind,<br />I couldn't see nothing.
3404680 3408390 I just laid there and cried.
3413960 3416873 And I didn't know what I was gonna do.
3416960 3421398 But I knew the time had come<br />for me to leave my daddy's house.
3422680 3424990 Suddenly, the world got big, and...
3428080 3431994 It was a long time before I could<br />cut it down to where I could handle it.
3433680 3436514 Part of that cutting down<br />was where I got to the place
3436600 3438592 where I could feel him<br />kicking in my blood,
3438680 3440273 and I knew the only thing<br />that separated us
3440360 3442477 was a matter of a few years.
3445520 3446874 What you got there, Uncle Gabe?
3447880 3449314 I got me a ham sandwich.
3449400 3451551 Rose gave me a ham sandwich.
3454040 3456191 I lost touch with everybody<br />except Gabriel.
3461200 3462190 But...
3465880 3467712 I hope he's dead.
3471960 3474634 I hope he found some peace.
3474720 3476757 That's a heavy story, Pop.
3478160 3481949 I didn't know you left home<br />when you was 14.
3482080 3484117 Fourteen's kinda young to be on your own.
3484200 3486078 I don't know what I would've done.
3486840 3489639 Well, I got up from that creek,<br />walked on down to Mobile.
3489720 3493396 I was through with farming.<br />I figured I'd do better in the cities.
3493480 3495312 So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.
3495400 3498996 Wait a minute,<br />you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.
3499080 3503154 Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.<br />You talking about some walking there!
3503240 3505994 That's the only way you got anywhere<br />back in them days.
3506080 3508914 Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have<br />hitched a ride with somebody.
3509000 3510673 Who you gonna hitch it with?
3510760 3512558 There ain't no cars<br />and things like they got now.
3512640 3514279 We talking about 1918.
3514360 3515919 What you all out here gettin' into?
3516000 3518196 I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.
3518280 3519555 He don't know nothing<br />about this I'm talking.
3519640 3522394 Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.<br />She says you supposed to pick her up.
3522480 3524233 Yeah, okay, Rose.
3524320 3527040 I walked on down to Mobile,
3527120 3530397 hitched up with some fellows<br />that was coming up this way.
3530480 3532119 Got up here and found out,
3532200 3533714 not only could you not get a job,
3533840 3535354 you couldn't find no place to live.
3535440 3538080 I thought I was in freedom.
3538360 3540750 Colored folks living down there<br />on the riverbanks
3540840 3543071 in whatever kind of shelter<br />they could find for themselves.
3543160 3545629 Right down there<br />under the Brady Street Bridge.
3546040 3549351 Living down there in shacks<br />made out of sticks and tar paper.
3550400 3552119 Messed around down there.
3552200 3554715 Went from bad to worse. Started stealing.
3554800 3557395 First, it was food.<br />Then I figure I steal me some money,
3557480 3559949 I can buy me some food,<br />buy me some shoes, too.
3560280 3562033 One thing led to another. Met your mama.
3562480 3564790 I was young, anxious to be a man.
3565360 3567716 I met your mama and had you.<br />Why'd I do that for?
3567800 3570235 Now, I got to worry about<br />feeding you and her.
3570320 3571800 Got to steal three times as much.
3572640 3576031 I went out one day<br />looking for somebody to rob.
3576160 3577435 That's what I was, I was a robber.
3578160 3579753 I'mma tell you the truth.
3579840 3581752 I'm ashamed of it today,<br />but it's the truth.
3582800 3584678 I went to rob this fella,<br />I pull out my knife.
3584760 3586911 He pulled out a gun, shot me in the chest.
3587000 3590232 It felt like somebody had taken<br />a hot branding iron and laid it on me.
3590320 3593358 Now, when he shot me,<br />I jumped at him with my knife,
3595240 3597072 and they say I killed him.
3597160 3599231 Locked me up, put me in<br />the penitentiary for 15 years.
3599320 3600674 That's where I met Bono.
3601240 3603516 Where I learned how to play baseball.
3603600 3605114 Got out that place,<br />and your mama had taken you,
3605200 3607192 went on to make a life without me.
3607280 3609351 Fifteen years was a long time<br />for her to wait.
3609440 3611318 But that 15 years<br />cured me of that robbing stuff.
3611400 3612754 Rose'll tell you.
3612840 3615116 I first met her, she ask me if I had
3615200 3617351 gotten all that foolishness<br />out of my system.
3617440 3619272 I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball,
3619360 3621079 "all what count to me." You hear me, Bono?
3621160 3623800 And I meant it, too.<br />She said, "Which one come first?"
3623880 3626952 I said, "Well, ain't no doubt it's baseball.
3627040 3628997 "But you stick and get old with me,
3629080 3630639 "and we'll both outlive this baseball."
3630720 3632837 Am I right, Rose?
3634040 3635110 And it's true.
3635200 3636953 Man, hush your mouth.<br />You ain't say no such thing.
3637040 3639635 Talkin' about, "Baby, you know<br />you'll always be number one with me."
3639720 3642315 That's what you was talking.
3642400 3644869 - That's why I love this woman.<br />- Rose will keep you straight.
3644960 3647077 You get off the track,<br />she'll straighten you up.
3647160 3648514 Lyons, you better get on up<br />and get Bonnie.
3648600 3650080 She waiting on you.
3650160 3651435 - Hey, Pop.<br />- Yeah?
3651520 3653557 You ought to come down to the Grill,<br />hear me play.
3654200 3655919 Man, I ain't goin' down there.
3656000 3657434 I'm too old to be hanging out<br />in them clubs.
3657520 3660797 You got to be good to<br />play down at the Grill.
3660880 3662360 Come on, Pop.
3662440 3666229 - I got to get up in the morning.<br />- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

3683240 3685197 and bring Bonnie,<br />you know I'm always glad to see her.
3685280 3688751 I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.
3688840 3690354 - See you, Pop.<br />- All right.
3690440 3692511 See you, Mr. Bono.
3692600 3695638 - See you, Uncle Gabe!<br />- Lyons! King of the Jungle!

3699800 3702076 - I'mma tear it up, too.<br />- Troy, I done told you now!
3702160 3706313 Hell, woman, it's Bono. Bono like family.<br />I done know this nigger since...
3706400 3708869 - How long have I known you?<br />- It's been a long time.
3708960 3711350 I done known this nigger<br />since Skippy was a pup!
3711440 3713272 Me and him done been through some times!
3713360 3715033 You sure are right about that.
3715120 3717112 Hell, I known him<br />longer than I known you, Rose,
3717200 3719032 and we still standin'<br />shoulder to shoulder.
3719120 3722511 Look here, Bono,<br />a man can't ask for no more than that.
3722600 3723829 I love you, nigger.
3723920 3725877 Hell! I love you, too.
3725960 3728953 But I got to get home, see my woman.<br />You got yours in hand.
3729360 3730794 I got to go get mine.
3732760 3734638 What you do that for, Pop?
3734720 3736074 What's the matter?<br />Cory, what's the matter?
3736160 3737913 Pop done went up to the school<br />and told Coach Zellman
3738000 3739150 I can't play football no more.
3739240 3740754 Wouldn't even let me play the game.
3740880 3742360 Told him to tell the recruiter<br />not to come.
3742440 3744238 - Troy.<br />- What you Troying me for?
3744320 3745913 Yeah, I did it.<br />And the boy knows why I did it.
3746000 3747878 Why you wanna do that to me?<br />That was the one chance I had!
3747960 3749394 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with Cory playing football, Troy.
3749480 3750630 The boy lied to me.
3750720 3753235 I told the nigger,<br />"You want to play football,
3753320 3754595 "you keep up with your chores
3754680 3757195 "hold that job down at the A&P."<br />That was the conditions.
3757280 3758760 I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...
3758840 3761560 I can't work after school<br />during the football season, Pop.
3761640 3763791 I tried to tell you<br />Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.
3763880 3766595 You don't never want to listen to nobody,<br />and then you wanna go and do this to me?
3766680 3768239 I ain't done nothin' to you.<br />You done it to yourself.
3768320 3769913 Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!
3770000 3771992 You're just scared<br />I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!
3777800 3779029 - Come here.<br />- Troy.
3779720 3780710 Troy.
3787720 3789040 Pick it up.
3798040 3799679 Put it on.
3807400 3809278 Strap it up.
3814880 3816234 All right.
3817800 3819553 See, you done made a mistake.
3819720 3822280 - I didn't even do nothing!<br />- I'll tell you what your mistake was.
3823080 3826630 You swung at the ball<br />and you didn't hit it.
3826760 3830390 That's strike one.<br />You in the batter's box now.
3831040 3833600 You swung and you missed, see?
3834840 3836069 That's strike one.
3839120 3842033 Don't you strike out.
3935160 3937994 Cory, why don't you come on in here,<br />help me clean out these cupboards.
3938160 3941437 I ain't quitting the team.<br />I don't care what Papa says.

3945520 3946795 Police done arrested him again.
3946920 3948593 Said he was disturbing the peace.
3948680 3950034 He'll be back directly.
3950120 3952680 Come on in here and help me<br />clean out these cupboards.
3952800 3954029 Come on.
3964360 3966238 Troy, what they say down there?
3966320 3969631 They ain't said nothing.<br />I give them $50, they let him go.
3969720 3971598 I'll talk to you about it.
3971680 3972670 Where Cory?
3972760 3975070 He in the house,<br />helping me clean out these cupboards.
3975200 3977032 All right, tell him to get his butt out here.
3979560 3981517 All they want is the money.
3981600 3983796 This makes six, seven times,<br />I done went down there and got him.
3983880 3986111 See me coming, they stick out their hands.
3986200 3988954 Yeah, I know what you mean.<br />That's all they care about, that money.
3989040 3991111 They don't care about what's right.
3992480 3996952 Nigger, why you got to go<br />and get some hardwood?
3997040 3999316 You ain't doing nothin'<br />but building a little old fence.
3999400 4001312 Get you some soft pinewood.<br />That's all you need.
4001400 4002993 I know what I'm doing. This outside wood.
4003080 4005311 You put pinewood inside the house.
4005400 4008472 Pinewood inside wood.<br />This here the outside wood.
4008560 4010756 Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?
4012160 4013958 You don't need this wood.
4014040 4015520 You can put it up with pinewood,
4015600 4017876 and it'll stand as long as<br />you gonna be here looking at it.
4017960 4019440 How you know<br />how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?
4019520 4021193 Hell, I might live forever.
4021280 4023875 I'll live longer than old man Horsely.
4023960 4025679 That's what Magee used to say.
4025760 4028116 Magee a damn fool.<br />Now you tell me who you ever heard of
4028200 4031238 gonna pull their own teeth<br />with a pair of rusty pliers?
4031320 4032436 They're old folks.
4032520 4034432 My granddaddy used to<br />pull his teeth with pliers.
4034520 4036637 They ain't had no dentists<br />for colored folk back then.
4036760 4039275 Well, get clean pliers.<br />You understand? Clean pliers.
4039360 4041920 Sterilize them.<br />Besides, we ain't living back then.
4042360 4045159 All he had to do<br />was go down to Doc Goldblum's.
4045240 4047800 I see where you and<br />that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,
4048440 4050397 see where you all done got tight.
4050480 4051755 What you mean, "got tight"?
4051840 4053877 I see where you be laughing<br />and joking with her all the time.
4053960 4056680 I laugh and joke with 'em all.<br />Bono, you know me.
4056760 4058752 Ain't the kind of laughing and joking<br />I'm talking about.
4060480 4061880 How you doing, Mr. Bono?
4061960 4063679 Cory, get that saw from Bono<br />and cut some wood.
4063760 4066195 He talking about wood too hard to cut.
4066280 4067873 Stand back there, Jim.
4068000 4069229 Let the young boy show you how it's done.
4069320 4071471 He's sure welcome to it.
4075880 4080113 Look at that.<br />Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.
4081320 4082800 Hell, I must be getting old
4082880 4084837 the way I'm watching that boy<br />whip through that wood.
4085040 4087430 I don't see why Mama<br />wants a fence around no yard no way.
4087560 4088596 Damn if I know, either.
4088680 4090751 I don't know what the hell<br />she keeping out with it.
4090840 4092832 She ain't got nothing nobody wants.
4094080 4095958 Some people build fences<br />to keep people out,
4096040 4098350 and other people build fences<br />to keep people in.
4099320 4101630 Rose wants to hold on to you all.<br />She loves you.
4102360 4105353 Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody<br />to tell me my wife loves me.
4105440 4108911 Cory, go in the house<br />and see if you can find the other saw.
4109040 4110679 Where's it at?
4110760 4113559 I said find it. Look for it till you find it.
4116360 4119751 What is that supposed to mean?<br />Want to keep us in?
4134320 4135436 Troy,
4136240 4139790 I done known you seem like<br />damn near my whole life.
4139880 4142634 You and Rose both.<br />I known both of you all for a long time.
4143720 4146189 I remember when you met Rose.
4146280 4149239 When you was hitting them baseball<br />out of the park.
4149600 4151831 A lot of them old gals was after you then.
4151960 4153917 You had the pick of the litter.
4154000 4157596 When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.
4158480 4161871 That's the first time<br />I knew you had any sense.
4162240 4165153 I said, "My man Troy<br />knows what he's doing.
4165240 4168392 "I'm gonna follow this nigger,<br />he might take me somewhere."
4168800 4170837 I been following you, too.
4170920 4174470 I done learned a whole heap of things<br />about life watching you.
4175960 4179192 I done learned how to tell<br />where the shit lies.
4179320 4181596 How to tell it from the alfalfa.
4182320 4184789 You done learned me a lot of things.
4184880 4187475 Showed me how to not<br />make the same mistakes.
4187960 4189758 To take life as it come along,
4189840 4192514 keep putting one foot<br />in front of the other.
4193000 4195640 - Rose is a good woman, Troy.<br />- I know she a good woman.
4195720 4197234 I've been married to her for 18 years.
4197320 4198674 What you got on your mind, Bono?
4198760 4201150 I just say she's a good woman,<br />like I say anything.
4201240 4202560 I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.
4202640 4205076 You just say she a good woman and<br />leave it hanging out there like that?
4205160 4206230 Why are you telling me she a good woman?
4206320 4209154 She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.
4209240 4210435 You saying I don't measure up?
4210560 4211789 That's what you tryin' to say.
4211880 4213599 I don't measure up<br />'cause I'm seeing this other gal.
4213680 4214830 I know what you tryin' to say.
4214920 4217071 I know what Rose means to you, Troy.
4217160 4220119 I'm just tryin' to say<br />I don't want to see you mess up.
4222120 4223315 Yeah.
4227000 4229674 Well, I appreciate that, Bono.
4231720 4235396 If you was messing around on Lucille,<br />I'd be telling you the same thing.
4235480 4236994 That's all I got to say.
4238040 4240999 I just say that 'cause I love you both.
4242360 4244033 Yeah.
4244880 4247349 You know me.<br />I wasn't out there looking for nothing.
4247440 4249875 You can't find a better woman<br />than Rose, I know that.
4250200 4253034 But it seems like this woman<br />just stuck on to me
4253120 4254270 where I can't shake her loose.
4254360 4258475 I done wrestled with it and tried to throw<br />her off, but now she stuck on tighter.
4258560 4260870 And now she stuck on for good.
4260960 4263714 You's in control.<br />That's what you tell me all the time.
4263800 4265553 You responsible for what you do.
4265640 4267393 I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.
4267480 4269870 As long as it set right in my heart,<br />then I'm okay.
4269960 4272873 'Cause that's all I listen to.<br />It tell me right and wrong every time.
4272960 4274792 And I ain't talking about<br />doing Rose no bad turn.
4274880 4276314 I love Rose.
4276400 4277959 She done carried me a long ways,
4278040 4279394 and I love and respect her for that.
4279480 4280630 I know you do.
4280720 4282837 That's why I don't want<br />to see you hurt her.
4282920 4285310 But what you gonna do when she finds out?
4285760 4287831 What you got then?
4287920 4289320 You try to juggle both of them,
4289400 4291153 sooner or later,<br />you gonna drop one of them.
4291240 4293436 - That's common sense.<br />- I know what you're saying, Bono.
4295160 4297197 I been trying to figure a way<br />to work it out.
4297280 4299317 Work it out right, Troy.
4299440 4302080 I ain't trying to get all up<br />between you and Rose's business,
4302160 4304356 but work it, so it come out right.
4304440 4306671 Hell, I get all between<br />you and Lucille's business.
4306760 4308274 And when you gonna buy that woman
4308360 4309714 that refrigerator she be wanting?
4309800 4311473 And don't tell me you ain't got no money.
4311560 4312835 I know who your banker is.
4312920 4315435 Mellon don't need that money<br />as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.
4315520 4316510 I know that.
4316600 4317716 - Tell you what I'll do.<br />- What?
4317800 4319792 When you finish building<br />this fence for Rose,
4319880 4321519 I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.
4321600 4324479 You done stuck your foot<br />in your mouth now.
4325600 4327193 Hey, nigger, where you going?
4327280 4328509 I'm going home.
4328600 4330432 I know you don't expect me<br />to help you now.
4330520 4331954 I'm protecting my money.
4332440 4335353 I want to see you put<br />that fence up by yourself.
4335440 4337033 That's what I want to see.
4337120 4339351 You'll be here<br />another six months without me.
4339480 4340800 Nigger, you ain't right.
4340880 4342553 When it come to my money,
4342640 4345712 I'm right as fireworks<br />on the Fourth of July.
4345800 4348952 We gonna see.<br />You better get out your bank book!
4401000 4403071 What they say down there?<br />What's happening with Gabe?
4403160 4406119 I went down there<br />and got him out. Cost me $50.
4406200 4407634 Said he was disturbing the peace.
4407720 4410155 Judge set up a hearing for him<br />in three weeks
4410240 4412835 to show cause<br />why he shouldn't be recommitted.
4412920 4414593 What'd you say? What'd you tell the judge?
4415000 4416639 I told him I'd take care of him.
4416720 4418279 It didn't make no sense<br />to recommit the man.
4418360 4419760 He stuck out his big greasy palm,
4419840 4422514 told me to give him $50<br />and take him on home.
4422600 4424512 Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?
4424600 4426512 Gone about his business.<br />He don't need nobody to hold his hand.
4426600 4428796 Well, I don't know, seem like that<br />would be the best place for him.
4428880 4429870 To put him in a hospital.
4429960 4432560 I know what you gonna say,<br />but that's what I think would be best.
4432640 4434279 Man had his life ruined fighting for what?
4434360 4435589 Now, they want to take him<br />and lock him up?
4435680 4437990 Let him be free.<br />Man ain't bothering nobody.
4439000 4441913 Everybody got their own way<br />of looking at it, I guess.
4442040 4443269 Come on, get your lunch.
4443360 4444953 I got some lima beans<br />and cornbread in the oven.
4445040 4446110 Come on, get somethin' to eat.
4446200 4447793 Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.
4447920 4449115 Rose, I got something to tell you.
4449240 4452074 - Wait till I put the food on the table.<br />- Rose...
4452920 4455754 Now, I don't know how to tell you this.
4459680 4461717 And I can't explain it none.
4461800 4464952 It just sort of grows on you.
4465960 4470477 It started off like a little bush,<br />next thing you know, it's a whole forest.
4470560 4473758 - Troy, what is you talking about?<br />- I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.
4473840 4475638 I'm trying to tell you,
4475720 4478155 find a way to tell you that
4483240 4485550 I'm gonna be a daddy.
4487720 4489996 Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.
4494560 4497314 Troy, you ain't telling me this.<br />You're gonna be what?
4497400 4498720 - You're gonna be somebody's daddy?<br />- Rose...
4498800 4499870 You're telling your wife this?
4499960 4500996 Now...
4501080 4503311 Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!
4503400 4505995 I got to wait 18 years<br />to hear something like this?
4506080 4507309 Hey, Rose.
4509240 4511596 I got a flower for you.
4514280 4517830 That's a rose. The same rose like you is.
4522840 4524274 Thanks, Gabe.
4524360 4525760 Troy, you ain't mad at me?
4525840 4527274 Them bad mens come and put me away.
4527360 4529750 - You ain't mad at me?<br />- No. No, I ain't mad at you.
4529840 4531752 Eighteen years,<br />and you want to come with this?
4531880 4534520 See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.
4537440 4538510 Rose, it's just that...
4538600 4540796 Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.<br />Ain't no explaining it.
4540880 4543520 The fella that give me this quarter<br />had a whole mess of 'em!
4543640 4546109 I'm gonna keep this quarter<br />till it stops shining.
4546200 4548760 Gabe, go on up front now.<br />I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.
4548840 4549990 Go on. I'll get you a piece.
4550080 4552800 Say, Rose, you know,<br />I was chasing hellhounds,
4552880 4555793 and them bad mens come<br />and get me and take me away.
4555880 4557872 Troy helped me.<br />He come down there and told them
4557960 4560873 they better let me go<br />before he beat them up!
4560960 4562235 Yeah, he did!
4562320 4564596 Go up front now, Gabe.<br />I'll get you some watermelon.
4564680 4566160 Them bad men is gone now.
4566240 4568596 Okay. Rose gonna give me some watermelon,
4568680 4571149 the kind with the stripes on it.
4576640 4578074 Why, Troy?
4579840 4581069 Why?
4581160 4586599 After all these years,<br />you come dragging this in to me now?
4586680 4588831 It don't make no sense at your age.
4589520 4593309 I could've expected this 10,<br />or 15 years ago, but not now.
4593600 4595831 Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.
4599920 4603197 I done tried to be everything<br />a wife should be.
4605200 4606475 Everything a wife could be.
4606560 4607835 I've been married 18 years,
4607920 4610435 and now,<br />I got to live to see the day you tell me
4610520 4614036 you been seeing another woman<br />and done fathered a child by her.
4627200 4631194 And you know I never wanted<br />no half-nothing in my family!
4634200 4635475 My whole family is half.
4635560 4637392 Everybody got different<br />fathers and mothers
4637480 4638960 and my two sisters and my brothers.
4639040 4640633 You could hardly tell who's who.
4640720 4642473 Could never sit down<br />and talk about Papa and Mama.
4642560 4645200 It was always your papa,<br />your mama, my papa, my mama.
4645280 4647795 And I ain't never wanted that<br />for none of my children!
4647880 4650396 And now, you want to drag your behind<br />in here and tell me something like this!
4650480 4652437 Stop it now. You ought to know.<br />It's time for you to know.
4652520 4654239 Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!
4674240 4675310 Rose?
4678440 4681831 I just can't make it go away.<br />It's done now.
4681920 4685834 I can't wish the circumstances<br />of the thing away.
4686000 4688595 And you don't want to, either.
4688680 4690478 Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.
4690560 4691914 Maybe that's what you want.
4692040 4694509 Well, you can't wish us away.
4694600 4696557 I got 18 years of my life invested in you.
4696640 4698677 You ought to have stayed upstairs<br />in my bed where you belong.
4698760 4701355 Now, listen to me.<br />We can get a handle on this thing.
4701440 4703272 We can talk this out,<br />come to an understanding.
4703360 4704589 All of a sudden it's "we."
4704720 4705949 Where was "we" at<br />when you were down there,
4706040 4707360 rolling around<br />with some godforsaken woman?
4707440 4710274 "We" should've come to an understanding before<br />you started making a damn fool of yourself!
4710360 4713234 You're a day late and a dollar short when<br />it comes to an understanding with me.
4713320 4719078 Rose, it's just that<br />she gives me a different idea.
4719600 4722752 A different understanding about myself.
4722840 4726311 I can step out of this house<br />and get away from the pressures
4726400 4727754 and the problems, be a different man.
4727840 4729638 I ain't got to worry about<br />how I'll get the roof fixed,
4729720 4731359 or pay the bills, or...
4731440 4732760 I can just
4734720 4737315 be a part of myself<br />I ain't never been before.
4738520 4740671 What I want to know is...
4743200 4745669 What I want to know
4745800 4748440 is do you plan to continue seeing her?
4748520 4750830 That's all you can say to me.
4752120 4756194 I could sit up in her house and laugh.<br />You understand what I'm saying?
4756280 4758875 I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.
4758960 4761191 It reaches all the way down<br />to the bottom of my shoes.
4761280 4762475 Rose, I...
4764880 4767679 I can't give that up.
4773480 4775631 Well, maybe you ought to go on<br />and stay down there with her,
4775720 4777393 if she's a better woman than me.
4777480 4779233 It ain't about nobody being<br />a better woman, or nothing.
4779320 4780640 Rose, you ain't to blame.
4780720 4782996 A man couldn't ask<br />for a better wife than you've been.
4783080 4784560 I'm responsible for it.
4784640 4786199 I done locked myself into a pattern,
4786280 4788272 trying to take care of you all,<br />that I forgot about myself.
4788360 4789999 Well, what the hell was I there for?
4790080 4791639 That was my job, not somebody else's.
4791720 4794838 Rose, listen to me.<br />I done tried all my life to live decent.
4794920 4797833 To live a clean, hard, useful life.
4797920 4801072 I try to be a good husband to you,<br />in every way I know how.
4801160 4803356 Maybe I come into the world backwards,<br />I don't know,
4803440 4806751 but you're born with two strikes on you<br />before you come to the plate.
4806840 4807956 You got to guard it closely,
4808040 4810680 always looking for the curveball<br />on the inside corner.
4810760 4812399 You can't afford a called strike.
4812480 4813834 You can't let nothing get past you.
4813920 4816037 If you're going down,<br />you're doing down swinging.
4816120 4818840 Everything lined up against you!
4820520 4822034 What you gonna do?
4823640 4826075 I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.
4826520 4830355 When I found you and Cory<br />and a halfway decent job, I was safe.
4830440 4832636 Couldn't nothing touch me!
4832720 4834154 I wasn't gonna strike out no more.
4834240 4835640 I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.
4835720 4838076 I wasn't gonna lie in the street<br />with a bottle of wine.
4838160 4842439 I was safe. I had me a family, a job.
4843640 4846314 I wasn't gonna get that last strike.
4848080 4850959 I was standing on first base,
4851040 4852997 waiting for one of them boys<br />to knock me in, to bring me home.
4853080 4854878 You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
4854960 4856394 Then I saw the gal,<br />she firmed up my backbone.
4856480 4859439 I got to thinkin' that if I tried,<br />maybe I could steal second.
4859520 4861000 - You understand?<br />- You should've held me tight.
4861080 4864471 - You should've grabbed me and held on.<br />- I stood on first base for 18 years,
4864560 4866950 and I thought, well,<br />God damn it, go on for it!
4867040 4869430 We ain't talking about baseball!
4869520 4871830 We talking about you going off<br />and laying up with another woman,
4871920 4872910 then bringing it home to me.
4873000 4875276 That's what we're talking about.<br />We're not talkin' about no baseball!
4875360 4876510 Rose, you're not listening to me.
4876640 4879519 I'm trying to explain it to you<br />the best way I know how.
4881080 4885552 It's not easy for me to admit that I've been<br />standing in the same place for 18 years!
4885640 4888155 Well, I've been standing with you!
4888240 4892280 I've been right here with you, Troy!<br />I got a life, too.
4892360 4896593 I gave 18 years of my life<br />to stand in the same spot as you!
4896680 4898637 Don't you think<br />I ever wanted other things?
4898720 4900837 Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?
4900920 4903515 What about my life? What about me?
4903600 4906190 Don't you think it ever crossed my<br />mind to want to know other men?
4906280 4910593 That I wanted to lay up somewhere<br />and forget about my responsibilities?
4910680 4912273 That I wanted someone to make me laugh,
4912360 4914397 so I could feel good?
4914480 4916551 You're not the only one<br />who's got wants and needs.
4916680 4918592 But I held on to you, Troy.
4918680 4922833 I took all my feelings,<br />my wants and needs and dreams,
4922920 4924718 and I buried them inside you.
4924800 4927076 I planted a seed<br />and watched and prayed over it.
4927160 4930153 I planted myself inside you<br />and waited to bloom!
4930240 4934075 And it didn't take me no 18 years<br />to realize the soil was hard and rocky,
4934160 4936277 and it wasn't never gonna bloom!
4936360 4939273 But I held on to you, Troy.<br />I held you tighter.
4939360 4941352 You was my husband.
4941440 4944080 I owed you everything I had.
4944160 4946834 Every part of me I could find to give you.
4946960 4950749 And upstairs in that bedroom,<br />with the darkness falling in on me,
4950880 4954954 I gave everything I had<br />to try and erase the doubt
4955040 4957714 that you wasn't the finest man<br />in the world.
4957800 4960474 And wherever you was going,<br />I was gonna be there with you,
4960600 4963035 because you was my husband.
4964480 4967473 'Cause that's the only way<br />I was gonna survive as your wife.
4968720 4972396 You always talking about what you give<br />and what you don't have to give.
4973080 4974799 But you take, too, Troy.
4974880 4977520 You take and<br />don't even know nobody's giving.
4977600 4978590 You say I take and don't give.
4978680 4979830 Troy, you're hurting me.
4979920 4981832 - Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!<br />- I gave you everything I got.
4981920 4983195 Don't you tell that lie on me.
4983280 4984680 - Mama!<br />- Don't you tell that lie!
4984760 4986274 Troy, you're hurting me!
4986880 4988234 Troy! Troy!
4988640 4992316 All right. That's strike two.
4993160 4997359 You stay away from around me, boy.<br />Don't you strike out.
4999040 5001032 You're living with a full count.
5004600 5006398 Don't you strike out!
5206880 5208712 Troy, I want to talk to you.
5211360 5213431 All of a sudden?
5215480 5217949 After all this time,<br />you want to talk to me, huh?
5219040 5220520 You ain't wanted to talk to me in months.
5220600 5221920 You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.
5222000 5223480 You didn't want no parts of me then.
5224120 5226112 What you want to talk to me about now?
5229760 5232719 - Tomorrow's Friday.<br />- I know what day tomorrow is.
5232800 5233950 You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?
5234080 5236231 My whole life, I ain't done nothing<br />but look to see Friday coming,
5236320 5237640 and you got to tell me it's Friday.
5237720 5239234 I want to know if you're coming home.
5239800 5242235 I always come home, Rose. You know that.
5242320 5243674 Ain't never been a night<br />I ain't come home.
5243800 5245439 That ain't what I mean, and you know it.
5245640 5249077 I wanna know if you're coming<br />straight home after work.
5249160 5252119 I figured I'd cash my check,<br />hang out at Taylors' with the boys.
5252200 5253316 Maybe play a game of checkers.
5253400 5255995 Troy, I can't live like this.<br />I won't live like this.
5256080 5257480 You're living on borrowed time with me.
5257560 5259552 Been going on six months now,<br />you ain't been coming home.
5259640 5261677 I come home every night.<br />Every night of the year.
5261760 5264229 That's 365 days.
5265760 5268355 I want you to come home<br />tomorrow after work.
5273360 5277036 Rose, I don't mess up my pay.<br />You know that.
5277120 5278998 I take my pay, I give it to you.
5279080 5282437 I don't have no money<br />but what you give me back.
5282520 5285672 I just want a little time to myself.
5285800 5286950 A little time to enjoy life.
5287040 5288918 What about me?<br />When's my time to enjoy life?
5289000 5291071 I don't know what to tell you, Rose.<br />I'm doing the best I can.
5291160 5292196 You ain't been comin' home from work,
5292280 5293634 but time enough<br />to change your clothes and run out.
5293720 5295712 You wanna call that the best you can do?
5297280 5300352 I'm going over to the hospital<br />to see Alberta.
5301480 5303153 She went into the hospital this afternoon.
5303240 5306677 Looks like she might have the baby early.
5307560 5309233 I won't be gone long.
5315640 5318709 Well, you ought to know. They went over<br />to Miss Pearl's and got Gabe today.
5318800 5322555 She said you told them to<br />go ahead and lock him up.
5322640 5326600 I ain't said no such thing.<br />Whoever told you that is telling a lie.
5326680 5328399 Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing<br />but telling a big, fat lie.
5328480 5330358 She ain't had to tell me.<br />I read it on the papers.
5330440 5332557 - What'd it say, huh?<br />- It said you told them to take him.
5332680 5334831 Then they screwed that up,<br />just like they screw up everything.
5334920 5336149 I ain't worried about<br />what they got on that paper.
5336240 5338152 It say the government sends<br />part of the check to the hospital,
5338240 5339310 the other part to you.
5339400 5341039 I got nothing to do with that,<br />if that's the way it works.
5341120 5342236 I don't make up the rules...
5342320 5343595 You did Gabe just like you did Cory.
5343680 5344875 You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,
5344960 5346599 but you signed for Gabe!<br />You signed that paper!
5346680 5348512 I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.
5348600 5350159 Hell, the only thing I signed<br />was the release form.
5350280 5351270 Hell, I can't read,
5351360 5352680 I don't know what they had on that paper.
5352760 5354592 I ain't signed nothing<br />about sending Gabe away.
5354680 5356831 I said send him to the hospital,<br />you said let him go free.
5356920 5357910 Then you went down there
5358040 5359474 and you signed him to the hospital<br />for half his money.
5359560 5361836 You went back on yourself, Troy.<br />You're gonna have to answer for that.
5361960 5363519 You just been over there<br />talking to Miss Pearl.
5363600 5366160 She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'<br />Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.
5366240 5367674 Troy, I seen where you signed the paper!
5367760 5368876 You ain't seen nothing I signed!

6701520 6703159 you're gonna have to kill me.
6704680 6705830 Come on.
6712800 6715952 Come on. Then I'll show you.
6716800 6717870 Come on!
6757080 6759151 Go on, get away from around my house.
6768920 6769910 Go on.
6770800 6772712 Tell Mama I'll be back for my things.
6772800 6775713 They'll be on the other side<br />of that fence!
6788040 6789713 Can't taste nothing.
6800200 6802351 I can't taste nothing.
6805400 6809110 Hallelujah!
6812040 6813554 Hallelujah.
6824080 6825480 Hallelujah.
6828080 6830390 I can't taste nothing no more.
6838240 6839594 Come on.
6840600 6842671 It's between you and me now.
6844080 6847756 Come on. Anytime you want.
6848760 6852276 Come on. I be ready for you.
6854000 6856754 But I ain't gonna be easy.
6869120 6870349 <i>Raynell?</i>
6870440 6872272 - <i>Ma'am?</i><br />- <i>What you doing?</i>
6872360 6873476 <i>Nothing.</i>
6873560 6876120 Get in here and get dressed.<br />What are you doing?
6876200 6877873 See if my garden growed.
6878120 6879554 I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.
6879640 6880790 You got to wait.
6881040 6883760 Yeah, but it look like it ain't<br />never gonna grow, Mama. Dag!
6884280 6886795 I told you, a watched pot never boils.
6886880 6888473 This ain't even no pot, Mama.
6888560 6889550 Get in here and get dressed.
6889640 6891438 This ain't no morning<br />to be playing around, you hear me?
6892040 6893394 Yes, ma'am.
6896000 6898037 Bye, garden.
6919480 6922757 Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.
6925320 6926674 Is your mama home?

6936600 6937829 Cory.
6938680 6940353 Cory. Cory!
6941800 6944634 Lord have mercy! Cory.
6948920 6950240 Lookee here, y'all.
6953160 6957074 - Looka here.<br />- Done got all grown up.
6957160 6958799 Don't cry, Mama. What you crying about?
6958880 6961349 I'm just so glad you made it.
6961440 6963432 Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?
6963640 6965632 Look at you, man, look at you.
6965720 6968554 Don't he look good, Rose?<br />Got on them corporal stripes.
6968640 6970040 What took you so long?
6970120 6971156 You know how the Marines are, Mama.
6971240 6973875 They got to get all their paperwork<br />straight before they let you do anything.
6973960 6977271 Well, I'm sure glad you made it.<br />They let Lyons come.
6977360 6978714 Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.
6978800 6980678 They don't know<br />if they're gonna let him out or not.
6980760 6982240 I talked to them a little while ago.
6982320 6984630 A corporal in the United States Marines.
6984800 6988874 Your daddy knew you had it in you.<br />He used to tell me all the time.
6989000 6990912 Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?
6991000 6994630 Yeah, he reminds me of Troy<br />when I first met him.
6995640 6997154 Say, Rose,
6997240 6999550 Lucille's down at the church<br />with the choir.
6999680 7001512 I'm gonna go get the pallbearers lined up.
7001640 7002835 I'll be back to get you all.
7003080 7004309 Thanks, Jim.
7004400 7005390 See you, Mr. Bono.
7009520 7012592 Cory, look at Raynell.
7012680 7013716 Ain't she precious?
7013800 7015154 She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.
7015520 7017000 Say hello to your brother.<br />This your brother, Cory.
7017080 7019436 - You remember Cory?<br />- No, ma'am.
7019520 7020590 Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.
7020680 7023240 Well, we talk about you.<br />She heard us talk about you.
7023840 7026355 This is your brother, Cory. Say hello.
7026440 7027760 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
7027840 7029069 So, you're Raynell.
7030360 7032556 Mama's told me a lot about you.
7032760 7034991 Come on, let me fix you some breakfast.<br />Keep up your strength.
7035080 7036150 I ain't hungry, Mama.
7036360 7039114 You can fix me something, Rose.<br />I'll be in there in a minute.
7039200 7040600 You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?
7040720 7042279 I know they ain't feeding you right.
7042360 7043760 No, Mama, thanks.<br />I don't feel like eating.
7043840 7044910 I'll get something later.
7046160 7048834 Raynell, get up there and<br />get that dress on like I told you.
7060120 7063238 I always knew you was gonna make<br />something out of yourself.
7064960 7067475 Your head was always<br />in the right direction.
7070480 7071550 So,
7073240 7074959 you gonna stay in?
7075040 7077316 Make it a career? Put in your 20 years?
7077720 7081316 I don't know.<br />I got six already. I think that's enough.
7081400 7084996 Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.
7085080 7086912 Ain't nothing out here.
7088480 7091314 I guess Rose told you<br />about what happened with me.
7093840 7096560 They got me down at the workhouse.
7096640 7099360 I thought I was being slick<br />cashing other people's checks.
7100680 7102433 How much time you doing?
7103280 7105749 They give me three years.
7105840 7108992 I got that beat now.<br />I ain't got but nine more months.
7114360 7116750 It ain't so bad.
7116880 7119839 You learn to deal with it<br />like anything else.
7122120 7124077 "You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights,"
7124160 7127358 that's what Papa used to say.
7127440 7131036 He used to say that when he struck out.
7131120 7133316 I seen him strike out<br />three times in a row,
7133400 7137633 and the next time up,<br />he hit the ball over the grandstand.
7137720 7140679 Right out there in Homestead Field.
7141320 7145109 He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.<br />He wanted to hit it over everything.
7146640 7148313 Then after the game,
7149880 7154397 he had 200 people standing around,<br />waiting to shake his hand.
7157800 7160395 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.
7164080 7165833 Papa was something else.
7167080 7169151 You still playing?
7169240 7170913 Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.
7171840 7174071 We got some fellas down there.<br />We got us a band.
7174160 7177153 We gonna try to stay together<br />when we get out, but...
7177240 7178310 Yeah.
7179840 7181911 I'm still playing.
7182520 7184034 Still helps me get out of bed<br />in the morning.
7184120 7185315 As long as it do that,
7185400 7188837 I'm gonna stick with it,<br />try to make some sense out of it.
7188920 7191435 Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.
7193920 7195832 Let me get in here<br />and get these eggs, man.
7195920 7197957 Get ready to go bury Papa.
7203960 7205280 How you doing?
7206960 7208360 You doing all right?
7226200 7228954 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
7229960 7231474 You used to sleep in my room?
7232760 7234752 Yeah, that used to be my room.
7235320 7238233 That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."
7240560 7242472 Got your football in the closet.
7242640 7245633 Raynell. Get up there, get dressed,<br />and put them good shoes on.
7245840 7248071 Mama, can I just wear these?<br />Them others hurt my feet!
7248160 7250038 Well, they're just gonna have<br />to hurt your feet for a while.
7250120 7252555 You ain't said they hurt your feet when<br />you went down to the store and got 'em.
7252680 7254831 They didn't hurt then.<br />My feet done got bigger.
7254920 7256479 Don't give me no back talk!
7256600 7259399 Get up there, get dressed,<br />and put them good shoes on.
7327080 7329914 Ain't too much changed.
7330000 7332640 He still got that rag tied to the tree.
7335920 7337912 He was out here swinging that bat.
7339480 7342314 I was just getting ready<br />to go back in the house.
7343600 7346320 He swung that bat and just fell over.
7348840 7352675 Seem like, when he swung it,<br />he stood there with this grin on his face.
7358600 7360273 Then he just fell over.
7363120 7366877 They carried him down there to the hospital,<br />but I knew there wasn't no need.
7369440 7372990 - Why don't you come on in the house?<br />- Mama, I got something to tell you.
7374360 7377512 I don't know how to tell you this,<br />but I got to tell you.
7377640 7379632 I'm not going to Papa's funeral.
7382040 7385795 Boy, hush your mouth.
7385880 7387872 That's your daddy you talking about!
7388120 7390157 I don't want to hear<br />that kind of talk this morning.
7390240 7391640 I done raised you to come to this?
7391720 7393040 You standing there all healthy and grown,
7393120 7394873 talking about<br />you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?
7394960 7397156 - Mama, listen...<br />- I don't want to hear it, Cory!
7397240 7398560 Just get that thought out of your head.
7398640 7401280 I've got to say no to him.<br />One time in my life, I got to say no.
7401360 7402874 I don't got to listen to that!
7402960 7404553 Now, I know you and your daddy<br />ain't seen eye to eye,
7404640 7408077 but I don't have to listen to<br />that kind of talk this morning.
7408160 7410720 Disrespecting your daddy<br />ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.
7410840 7412559 You gotta find some way<br />to come to that on your own.
7412640 7415109 Not going to your daddy's funeral<br />ain't gonna make you a man.
7418160 7421073 The whole time I was growing up,<br />living in his house,
7421160 7424073 Papa was like a shadow<br />that followed you everywhere.
7424840 7428072 It weighed on you,<br />and it sunk into your flesh.
7428760 7430717 It would wrap around you and lay there
7430800 7433235 until you couldn't tell<br />which one was you anymore.
7433360 7437513 That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!
7437600 7439910 Trying to crawl in.<br />Trying to live through you.
7440840 7445517 Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson<br />staring right back at me.
7445600 7448752 Hiding under the bed, in the closet.
7448840 7451878 I'm just saying I got to find a way<br />to get rid of that shadow, Mama.
7451960 7454191 You just like him.<br />You got him in you good.
7454280 7455430 Don't tell me that, Mama.
7455520 7459196 - You Troy Maxson all over again.<br />- I don't want to be Troy Maxson!
7460520 7462113 I just want to be me.
7462200 7465113 You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.
7465200 7468272 That shadow wasn't nothing<br />but you growing into yourself.
7468480 7470437 You either got to grow into it,<br />or cut it down to fit you,
7470520 7472796 but that's all you got to make a life with.
7472880 7476874 That's all you got to measure yourself<br />against the world out there.
7477880 7480793 Your daddy wanted you<br />to be everything he wasn't,
7480880 7482394 and at the same time,
7482480 7485234 he wanted you to be everything he was.
7485560 7487279 Now, I don't know<br />if he was right or wrong,
7487360 7488476 but I do know
7488560 7491553 he meant to do more good<br />than he meant to do harm.
7493560 7496394 Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised,
7497160 7500437 and sometimes,<br />when he took me in his arms, he cut.
7507240 7509391 When I first met your daddy,
7510320 7511754 I thought,
7512000 7515072 "Here is a man I can lay down with<br />and make a baby."
7518680 7521593 That's the first thing<br />I thought when I seen him.
7521680 7523990 I thought, "Rose Lee,
7524680 7526797 "here's a man you can open yourself up to
7526880 7529076 "and be filled to bursting!
7530600 7535356 "Here's a man that can<br />fill up all them empty spaces
7535440 7538080 "you been tipping around the edges of."
7543360 7546353 When your daddy walked through the house,
7546440 7548113 he was just
7549280 7551636 so big.
7553360 7555033 He filled it up!
7557560 7560394 That was my first mistake.
7560480 7562790 Not to make him leave some room for me.
7567400 7569869 But I wanted a house I could sing in.
7571320 7574552 And that's what your daddy gave me.
7574640 7578714 I didn't know to keep up his strength,<br />I had to give up little pieces of mine.
7580560 7583917 I took on his life as mine<br />and mixed up the pieces,
7584000 7586993 so you couldn't hardly tell<br />which was which.
7589840 7592992 It was my choice. My life.
7593080 7596073 And I didn't have to live it like that,
7598160 7601515 but that's what life offered me in the way<br />of being a woman, and I took it.
7603680 7606514 I grabbed it with both hands.
7606600 7609672 And by the time<br />Raynell came into the house...
7614680 7619038 I didn't want to make my blessings<br />off of nobody's misfortune,
7620880 7623952 but I took on to Raynell like she was
7624040 7627192 all them babies I wanted and never had.
7629440 7632433 Like I'd been blessed<br />to relive a part of my life.
7635560 7638712 And if the Lord see fit<br />to keep up my strength,
7640800 7644794 I'm gonna do her exactly<br />how your daddy did you.
7648400 7651154 I'm gonna give her<br />the best of what's in me.
7661160 7662150 Mama!
7662320 7664391 Reverend Tolliver on the phone.
7682160 7683150 Hi.
7685680 7686670 Hi.
7687280 7690910 - You in the Army or the Marines?<br />- Marines.
7692120 7695352 Papa said it was Army. You know Blue?
7695760 7697114 Blue? Who's Blue?
7697440 7699511 Papa's dog,<br />what he sing about all the time.
7702280 7704795 <i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>
7706520 7708955 <i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>
7709800 7711871 <i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>
7712960 7715270 <i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>
7716440 7718397 <i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>
7719640 7721393 <i>From that you know Blue was a good old dog</i>
7721480 7723790 <i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>
7724560 7727314 <i>Blue treed a possum out on a limb</i>
7727400 7729232 <i>Blue looked at me and I looked at him</i>
7729960 7732395 <i>Grabbed that possum, put him in a sack</i>
7732480 7734312 <i>Blue stayed there till I came back</i>
7734800 7737315 <i>Old Blue's feet was big and round</i>
7737400 7739471 <i>Never let a possum touch the ground</i>
7740080 7742231 <i>Old Blue died and I dug his grave</i>
7742320 7744710 <i>I dug his grave with a silver spade</i>
7745080 7747470 <i>Let him down with a golden chain</i>
7747560 7749472 <i>And every night I call his name</i>
7749840 7751832 <i>Go on, Blue, you good dog you</i>
7751920 7752910 Come on.
7753000 7755151 <i>Go on, Blue, you good dog you</i>
7755480 7757995 <i>Blue laid down and died like a man</i>
7758320 7760437 <i>Blue laid down and died</i>
7761680 7764991 <i>Blue laid down and died like a man</i>
7766160 7768994 <i>Now he's treeing possums</i><br /><i>In the Promised Land</i>
7769920 7772515 <i>I'm gonna tell you this</i><br /><i>Just to let you know</i>
7772840 7775355 <i>Blue's gone where the good dogs go</i>
7777200 7780511 <i>Blue's gone where the good dogs go</i>
7783880 7786270 Cory, we're getting ready to leave now!
7793360 7796194 Go upstairs and put your shoes<br />on like Mama told you,
7796360 7799194 so we can get ready<br />to go to Papa's funeral.
7800200 7802351 Okay. I'll be back.
7812600 7813636 Rose!
7816560 7817880 Hey, Rose!
7818240 7820391 - Gabe?<br />- I'm here! I'm here, Rose!
7820480 7822392 Hey, Rose, I'm here!
7822480 7824073 - Lyons, lookit here!<br />- See, Rose?
7824160 7825992 I told you. I told you they'd let him come.
7826080 7828072 - How you doing, Uncle Gabe?<br />- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
7828160 7830311 Hey! Hey, Rose, it's time!
7830400 7833757 It's time to tell Saint Peter<br />to open the Gates.

7840600 7843513 I'm gonna tell Saint Peter<br />to open the Gates.
7843600 7845910 You get ready now.
