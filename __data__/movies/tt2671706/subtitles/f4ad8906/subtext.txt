78177 80233 - What did Mr. Rand say?<br />- Ain't said nothing.
80234 82923 Figure if the nigger too dumb to know<br />he carrying a watermelon,
82924 84683 he wasn't gonna get much sense out of him.
84684 87479 Trying to hide that great big old<br />watermelon under his coat.
87480 90099 Afraid to let the white man<br />see him carry it home.

102237 105083 He walked away from me calling you a "troublemaker."
105381 107952 - What Mr. Rand say?<br />- Ain't said nothing.
107953 110484 He told me to go down the Commissioner's office<br />next Friday.
110485 112361 They called me down there to see them.
112362 115673 Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,<br />they can't fire you.
115674 118407 That's what one of them white fellows tell me.<br />I ain't worried about them firing me.
118408 120615 They gonna fire me cause I asked a question?
120821 123844 That's all I did. I went to Mr. Rand and asked him,
124229 127635 Why? Why you got the white<br />mens driving and the colored lifting?
127636 129316 Told him what's the matter, don't I count?
129317 131791 You think only white fellows got sense<br />enough to drive a truck.
131792 134081 That ain't no paper job! Hell,<br />anybody can drive a truck.
134082 136523 How come you got all whites driving and the<br />colored lifting?

140753 143823 Well, hell, that's what I done!<br />Now they wanna come up with this pack of lies.
143824 147764 I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions,<br />just tell the truth!
147765 150741 It ain't nothing but something they done trumped up on you<br />cause you filed a complaint on them.
150742 153601 Brownie don't understand nothing.
153602 155670 All I want them to do is change the job<br />description.
155671 157358 Give everybody a chance to drive the truck.
158878 161442 Brownie can't see that. He ain't got that much sense.
182827 185331 How you figure he be making out with that gal be up<br />at Taylors' all the time, that Alberta gal?
185332 187835 What is there in Taylor's? That of Alberta.

211607 213519 I see where you be eyeing her.
213520 215896 I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.
215897 218630 Don't never let nobody tell you Troy Maxson<br />don't eye the women.

223534 226617 What that mean cause I buy her a drink?<br />I'm just being polite.
226618 229785 It's all right to buy her one drink.<br />That's what you call being polite.
229786 233302 But when you wanna be buying two or three,<br />that's what you call eyeing her.
233303 236693 Look here, as long as you known me,<br />you ever known me to chase after women?
236694 240731 Hell yeah! Long as I done known you.<br />You forgetting I knew you when.

242531 245016 Oh, not since you been married to Rose.
245017 246930 Now, that's the truth, there. I can say that.
246931 248592 All right then! Case closed.
248990 251621 I see you be walking up around Alberta's house.

258948 262290 Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere! That don't mean<br />nothing cause you see me walking around there.
262291 264987 Where she come from anyway?<br />She just kinda showed up one day.
264988 268357 Tallahassee. You can look at her and tell<br />she one of them Florida gals.
268358 270635 They got some big healthy women down there.
270636 272353 Grow them right up out the ground.
272354 274346 Got a little bit of Indian in her.
274347 276512 Most of them niggers down in Florida got some<br />Indian in them.
276513 280710 I don't know about that Indian part.<br />But she damn sure big and healthy.
281271 283673 Woman wear some big stockings.
283674 288112 Got them great big old legs and hips<br />as wide as the Mississippi River.
288113 291066 Legs don't mean nothing. You don't do nothing<br />but push them out of the way.
291067 293758 But them hips cushion the ride!
293759 295801 Troy, you ain't got no sense.
295802 298545 It's the truth! Like you riding on Goodyears!
301814 303892 What you all out here getting into?
303893 305938 What you worried about what we getting into for?
305939 307362 This is men talk, woman.
307363 310309 What I care what you all talking about?<br />Bono, you gonna stay for supper?
310310 313973 No, I thank you, Rose. But Lucille say<br />she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.
313974 316397 Pigfeet! Hell, I'm going home with you!
316398 318344 Might even stay the night if you got some<br />pigfeet.
318345 320366 You got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?
320367 322906 I'm cooking up some chicken. I got some<br />chicken and collard greens.
322907 326611 Well, go on back in the house and let me and Bono finish<br />what we was talking about. This is men talk.
326612 328109 I got some talk for you later.
328110 330235 You know what kind of talk I mean.
330236 333453 - You go on and powder it up.<br />- Troy Stop!
334250 335973 Aw, woman, come here.
337275 338868 Look here, Bono
339693 341786 When first I met this woman,
341787 344034 I got out that place, say,
344035 347369 "Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare,
347370 350050 there's a woman out there for me somewhere."
350051 353554 I looked here. Looked there. Saw Rose<br />and latched on to her.
353555 356124 I latched on to her<br />and told her,
356125 357686 I'm gonna tell you the truth.
357687 359053 I told her,
359054 361364 "Baby, I don't wanna marry,
361692 363655 I just wanna be your man."
363656 366319 Rose told me... tell him what you told me, Rose.
366320 368191 I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,
368192 370644 then move out the way so<br />the marrying kind could find me.
370645 373192 That's what she told me. Nigger, you in my way.
373193 376314 You blocking the view! Move out the way<br />so I can find me a husband.
376315 377933 I thought it over two or three<br />days. Come back
377934 380339 Ain't no two or three days nothing.<br />You was back the same night.
380340 382008 Come back, told her...
382009 385040 "Okay baby, but<br />I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster
385041 387823 and put him out there in the backyard<br />and when he see a stranger come,
387824 389319 he'll flap his wings and crow."
389320 391691 Look here, Bono, I could watch<br />the front door by myself,
391692 393792 it was that back door<br />I was worried about.
393793 397093 Troy, you ought not talk like that.<br />Troy ain't doing nothing but telling a lie.
397094 399773 Only thing is when we first got<br />married forget the rooster,
399774 401410 we ain't had no yard!
401411 405060 I hear you tell it. Me and Lucille was staying<br />down there on Logan Street.
405061 407484 Had two rooms with the<br />outhouse in the back.
407485 409308 I ain't mind the outhouse none.
409309 413533 But when that goddamn wind blow through there<br />in the winter,that's what I'm talking about!
413534 417745 To this day I wonder why in the hell I ever<br />stayed down there for six long years.
417746 420479 But see, I didn't know I could do no better.
420480 423384 I thought only white folks had inside<br />toilets and things.
423385 426190 There's a lot of people don't know they can do<br />no better than they doing now.
426191 429220 That's just something you got to learn.<br />A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.
429221 431195 Ain't nothing wrong with shopping at Bella's.<br />She got fresh food.
431196 434320 I ain't said nothing about if she got fresh food<br />I'm talking about what she charge.
434321 436439 She charge ten cents more than the A&P.
436440 439597 The A&P ain't never done nothing for me.<br />I spends my money where I'm treated right.
439598 443612 I go down to Bella, say, I need a loaf of bread,<br />"I'll pay you Friday." She give it to me.
443613 445610 What sense that make when I got money to go
445611 448983 and spend it somewhere else and ignore<br />the person who done right by me?
448984 451243 That ain't in the Bible.<br />- We ain't talking about what's in the Bible.
451244 453078 What sense it make to shop there<br />when she overcharge?
453079 456770 You shop where you want to. I'll do my shopping<br />where the people been good to me.
456771 458516 Well, I don't think it's right for her to overcharge.<br />That's all I was saying.
458517 461253 Look here, I got to get on. Lucille be<br />raising all kind of hell.
461254 464413 Where you going, nigger? We ain't finished this pint.<br />Come here, finish this pint.
464414 467639 Well, hell, I am, if you ever turn<br />the bottle loose.
468253 470427 The only thing I say about the A&P is I'm glad
470428 472878 Cory got that job down there.
472879 474911 Help him take care of his<br />school clothes and things.
474912 477438 Gabe done moved out and things getting tight<br />around here.
477439 480139 He got that job, he can start<br />to look out for himself.
480140 483343 Cory done went and got recruited by a college<br />football team.
483344 485992 I told that boy about that college football stuff.
486598 489505 The white man ain't gonna let him<br />get nowhere with that football.
489506 491777 I told him when he first come to me<br />with it.
491778 494212 Now you come telling me he done went<br />and got more tied up in it.
494213 496581 He ought to go and get recruite<br />in how to fix cars
496582 498093 or something where he can make a living.
498094 500421 He ain't talking about making<br />no living playing football.
500422 502269 It's just something the boys in school do.
502270 504157 They gonna send a recruiter by to talk to you.
504158 506729 He'll tell you heain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
506730 508399 It's a honor to be recruited.
508400 511034 It ain't gonna get him nowhere.<br />Bono'll tell you that.
511035 513970 If he be like you in the sports,<br />he's gonna be all right.
513971 516824 Ain't but two men ever played<br />baseball as good as you.
516825 518903 That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.
518904 521164 Them's the only two men ever hit<br />more home runs than you.
521165 523421 What it ever get me? Ain't got a pot to piss in
523422 524937 or a window to throw it out of.
524938 526656 Times have changed since you was<br />playing baseball, Troy
526657 528867 That was before the war.<br />Times have changed a lot since then.
528868 531735 - How in hell they done changed?<br />- They got lots of colored boys playing ball now.
531736 534248 - Baseball and football.<br />- You right about that, Rose
534249 537723 Times have changed, Troy.<br />You just come along too early.
537724 541158 There ought not never have been no time<br />called too early!
542113 544104 Now you take that fellow
545321 547812 what's that fellow they had playing right field<br />for the Yankees back then?
547813 549308 You know who I'm talking about, Bono.<br />Used to play right field for the Yankees.
549309 551701 - Selkirk?<br />- Selkirk! That's it!
551702 554101 Man batting .269, understand?
554102 556292 .269. What kind of sense that make?
556293 559074 I was hitting .432 with thirty-seven home runs!
559075 562011 Man batting .269 and playing<br />right field for the Yankees!
562012 564414 I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.
564415 566985 She walking around with raggedy<br />shoes on her feet.
566986 570507 Now I bet you Selkirk's daughter ain't walking around<br />with raggedy shoes on her feet! I bet you that!
570508 572578 They got a lot of colored baseball players now.
572579 575332 Jackie Robinson was the first. Folks<br />had to wait for Jackie Robinson.
575333 578663 I done seen a hundred niggers play baseball<br />better than Jackie Robinson.
578664 581427 Hell, I know some teams Jackie Robinson<br />couldn't even make!
581428 584625 What you talking about Jackie Robinson.<br />Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody.
584626 587498 I'm talking about if you could play ball<br />then they ought to have let you play.
587499 590522 Don't care what color you were.<br />Come telling me I come along too early.
590523 592774 If you could play,<br />then they ought to have let you play.
593607 596839 You gonna drink yourself to death.<br />You don't need to be drinking like that.
598532 600559 Death ain't nothing. I done seen him.
600560 602738 Done wrassled with him. You can't tell me<br />nothing about death.
602739 606186 Death ain't nothing but a fastball<br />on the outside corner.
606187 608235 And you know what I'll do to that!
608236 610048 Lookee here, Bono, am I lying?
610049 613132 You get one of them fastballs,<br />about waist high,
613133 614757 over the outside corner of the plate
614758 616476 where you can get the meat of the bat on it
616477 620831 and good god! You can kiss it goodbye.<br />Now, am I lying?
620832 623455 Naw, you telling the truth there. I seen you do it.
623456 627103 If I'm lying that 450 feet worth of lying!
627104 628732 That's all death is to me.
628733 631270 A fastball on the outside corner.
631271 633548 I don't know why you want to get on<br />talking about death.
633549 635647 Ain't nothing wrong with talking about death.<br />That's part of life.
635648 640052 Everybody gonna die. You gonna die, I'm gonna die.<br />Bono's gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.
640053 642455 But you ain't got to talk about it.<br />I don't like to talk about it.
642456 645406 You the one brought it up.<br />Me and Bono was talking about baseball
645407 648696 you tell me I'm gonna drink myself to death.<br />Ain't that right, Bono?
648697 651203 You know I don't drink this<br />but one night out of the week.
651204 653913 That's Friday night. I'm gonna drink just<br />enough to where I can handle it.
653914 655581 Then I cuts it loose. I leave it alone.
655582 657956 So don't you worry about me<br />drinking myself to death.
657957 659557 'Cause I ain't worried about Death.
659558 661786 I done seen him. I done wrestled with him.
662135 663481 Look here, Bono
663482 667029 I looked up one day and Death was marching<br />straight at me.
667030 670492 Like Soldiers on Parade! The Army of Death
670493 674780 was marching straight at me.<br />The middle of July, 1941.
674781 677418 It got real cold just like it be winter.
677419 681116 It seem like Death himself reached out and<br />touched me on the shoulder.
681117 683131 He touch me just like I touch you.
683132 685873 I got cold as ice and Death standing there<br />grinning at me.
685874 689418 - Troy, why don't you hush that talk.<br />- I say "What you want, Mr. Death?
689419 692738 You be wanting me? You done brought<br />your army to be getting me?"
692739 695123 I looked him dead in the eye.<br />I wasn't fearing nothing.
695124 698032 I was ready to tangle.<br />Just like I'm ready to tangle now.
698033 699970 The Bible say "be ever vigilant."
699971 702658 That's why I don't get but so drunk.<br />I got to keep watch.
702659 705762 Troy was right down there in Mercy Hospital.<br />You remember he had pneumonia?
705763 707589 Laying there with a fever talking<br />plumb out of his head.
707590 710615 Death standing there staring at me<br />carrying that sickle in his hand.
710616 716702 Finally he say,<br />"You want bound over for another year?"
716703 718013 See, just like that.
718014 722780 "You want bound over for another year?"
722781 726552 I told him, "Bound over hell!<br />Let's settle this now!"
726553 728807 It seem like he kinda fell back when I said that
728808 730227 and all the cold went out of me.
730228 732382 I reached down and grabbed that sickle
732383 735789 and threw it just as far as I could throw it<br />and me and him commenced to wrestling.
735790 738414 We wrestled for... up to six,
738415 739980 three days and three nights.
739981 741767 I can't say where I found the<br />strength from.
741768 743640 Every time it seemed like he was gonna get<br />the best of me,
743641 746390 I'd reach way down deep inside myself
746391 747886 and find the strength to do him one better.
747887 750801 Every time Troy tell that story,<br />he find different ways to tell it.
750802 752569 Different things to make up about it.
752570 755550 I ain't making up woman.<br />I'm telling you the facts of what happened.
755551 759880 I wrestled with Death for three days and three nights<br />and I'm standing here to tell you about it.
762265 764699 All right. At the end of the third night
764700 767906 we done weakened each other to<br />where we can't hardly move.
767907 769702 Death stood up, throwed on his robe
769703 771579 had him a white robe with a hood on it.
771580 775078 He throwed on that robe and<br />went off to look for his sickle.
775079 777423 Say, "I'll be back." Just like that.
777424 778763 "I'll be back."
778764 781728 I told him, say, "Yeah, but you gonna<br />have to find me!" I wasn't no fool.
781729 785871 I wasn't no fool. I wasn't going looking for him.<br />Death ain't nothing to play with.
785872 790338 I know I got to join his army,<br />his camp followers.
790339 793473 But as long as I keep my strength and<br />see him coming
793474 795766 as long as I keep up my vigilance
795767 797558 he's gonna have to fight to get me.

834049 835753 Hey, Lyons, how you been?
835754 838441 He must have been doing all right. I ain't seen<br />him around here last week.
838442 841629 Troy, leave your boy alone. He come by to see<br />you and you wanna start all that nonsense.
841630 844796 I ain't bothering Lyons. Here, get you a drink.<br />We got an understanding.
844797 848038 I know why he come by to see me and<br />he know I know.

852146 854391 You gonna stay for supper, Lyons? I got some<br />chicken cooking in the oven.
854392 857818 No, Rose, thanks. I was just in the neighborhood<br />and thought I'd stop by for a minute.
857819 860807 You was in the neighborhood all right, nigger.<br />You telling the truth there.
860808 862640 You was in the neighborhood<br />'cause it's my payday.
862641 865390 Well, hell, since you mentioned it,<br />let me have ten dollars.
865391 866927 I'll be damned!
866928 868752 I'll die and go to hell
868753 871591 and play blackjack with the devil<br />before I give you ten dollars.
871592 874373 That's what I want to know about that<br />devil you done seen.
874374 876669 Pop done seen the devil? You too much Pops.
876670 878857 Yeah, I done seen him. Talked to him too!
878858 881151 You ain't seen no devil. I done told you that<br />man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.
881152 883414 Anything you can't understand,<br />you want to call it the devil.
883415 886639 Look here, Bono, I went down to see<br />Hertzberger about some furniture.
886640 889593 Got three rooms for 298.<br />That what it say on the radio.
889594 893115 Three rooms 298. Even made up<br />a little song about it.
893116 896219 Go down there, man<br />tell me I can't get no credit.
896220 898567 I'm working every day and<br />can't get no credit.
898568 901486 I got an empty house with some<br />raggedy furniture in it.
901487 904726 Cory ain't got no bed. He's sleeping on a pile of<br />rags on the floor.
904727 907032 Working every day and can't get<br />no credit.
907033 910370 Come back here. Rose'll tell you madder than hell.<br />Sit down try to figure what I'm gonna do.
910371 912824 Come a knock on the door. Ain't been<br />living here but three days.
912825 914174 Who know I'm here?
914175 916139 Open the door devil standing there<br />bigger than life.
916140 920561 White fellow, got on good clothes and everything.<br />Standing there with a clipboard in his hand.
920562 923115 I ain't had to say nothing. First words<br />come out of his mouth was
923116 926255 "I understand you need some furniture<br />and can't get no credit."
926256 927562 I liked to fell over. He say,
927563 932020 "I'll give you all the credit you want,<br />but you got to pay the interest on it."
932021 934814 I told him, "Give me three rooms' worth<br />and charge whatever you want."
934815 938402 Next day a truck pulled up here and<br />two men unloaded them three rooms.
938403 940758 Man what drove the truck give me a book.
940759 944194 Say send ten dollars, first of every month to the<br />address in the book
944195 945502 and everything will be all right.
945503 949628 Say if I miss a payment the devil was<br />coming back and it'll be hell to pay.
949629 952550 That was fifteen years ago. To this day
952551 955146 the first of the month I send my ten dollars,
955147 956714 just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.
956715 959371 - Troy lying.<br />- I ain't never seen that man since.
959372 961408 Now you tell me who else that could have been<br />but the devil?
961409 964563 I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.<br />Naw, I wouldn't have truck with the devil
964564 967429 about nothing like that. But I got my furniture
967430 970017 and I send my ten dollars the<br />first of the month just like clockwork.
970018 973069 How long you say you been paying<br />this ten dollars a month?
973070 976067 - Fifteen years!<br />- Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?
976068 978016 How much the man done charged you?
978017 981157 Aw hell, I done paid for it. I done paid for it<br />ten times over!
981158 983406 - The fact is I'm scared to stop paying it.<br />- Troy lying.
983407 985143 We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.
985144 986847 He ain't paying no ten dollars a month<br />to nobody.
986848 989318 Aw hell, woman. Bono know<br />I ain't that big a fool.
989319 991980 I was just getting ready to say. I know<br />where there's a bridge for sale.
991981 994825 I'll tell you this, it don't matter to me<br />if he was the devil.
994826 997315 It don't matter if the devil give credit.<br />Somebody got to give it.
997316 1000623 It ought to matter. You walking around here<br />saying you go making a truck with the devil
1000624 1003878 God's the one you gonna have to answer to.<br />He's the one gonna be at the Judgment.
1003879 1006911 Yeah, well, look here, Pop, let me have<br />that ten dollars. I'll give it back to you.
1006912 1008750 Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.
1008751 1010690 What I tell you, Bono? The only time<br />I see this nigger is
1010691 1013127 when he wants something. That's the<br />only time I see him.
1013128 1015288 Come on, Pop, Mr. Bono don't want<br />to hear all that.
1015289 1017550 Let me have the ten dollars.<br />I told you Bonnie working.
1017551 1019977 What that mean to me? "Bonnie working."<br />I don't care if she working.
1019978 1022193 Go ask her for the ten dollars<br />if she working.
1022194 1023621 Talking about "Bonnie working."
1023622 1025074 Why ain't you working?
1025075 1027317 Aw, Pop, you know I can't find no decent job.
1027318 1029564 Where am I gonna get a job at?<br />You know I can't get no job.
1029565 1031881 I told you I know some people down there.
1031882 1034534 I can get you on the rubbish<br />if you want to work.
1034535 1036795 I told you that the last time you came by here<br />asking me for something.
1036796 1039636 Naw, Pop thanks. That ain't for me.<br />I don't wanna be carrying nobody's rubbish.
1039637 1041361 I don't want to be punching<br />nobody's time clock
1041362 1043670 What's the matter, you too good<br />to carry people's rubbish?
1043671 1045634 Where you think that ten dollars<br />you talking about come from?
1045635 1047358 I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish<br />and give my money to you
1047359 1049326 'cause you too lazy to work.
1049327 1052201 You too lazy to work and wanna know<br />why you ain't got what I got.
1052202 1055892 - What hospital Bonnie working at? Mercy?<br />- She's down at Passavant working in the laundry.
1055893 1057648 I ain't got nothing as it is.<br />I give you that ten dollars
1057649 1059120 and I got to eat beans the rest of the week.
1059121 1060965 Naw, you ain't getting no ten dollars here.
1060966 1063179 You ain't got to be eating no beans.<br />I don't know why you wanna say that.
1063180 1065228 I ain't got no extra money.
1066772 1070662 Gabe done moved out giving his money over there<br />to Miss Pearl's, paying her the rent,
1070663 1072186 and things done got tight around here.
1072187 1073870 I can't afford to be giving you every payday.
1073871 1076655 I ain't asked you to give me nothing.<br />I asked you to loan me ten dollars.
1076656 1078769 - I know you got ten dollars.<br />- Yeah, I got it.
1078770 1082140 You know why I got it? 'Cause I don't throw<br />my money away out there in the streets.
1082141 1086227 You living the fast life wanna be a musician<br />running around in them clubs and things
1086228 1087752 then, you learn to take care of yourself.
1087753 1090331 You ain't gonna find me going and asking<br />nobody for nothing.
1090666 1093638 - I done spent too many years without.<br />- You and me is two different people, Pop.
1093639 1097103 I done learned my mistake and<br />learned to do what's right by it.
1097104 1100063 You still trying to get something for nothing.<br />Life don't owe you nothing.
1100064 1102917 You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono.<br />He'll tell you I'm right.
1102918 1105356 You got your way of dealing with the world.<br />I got mine.
1105357 1107258 The only thing that matters to me is<br />the music.
1107259 1109599 Yeah, I can see that! It don't matter<br />how you gonna eat
1109600 1112596 where your next dollar is coming from.<br />You telling the truth there.
1112597 1114992 I know I got to eat. But I got to live too.
1114993 1117258 I need something that gonna help me to get<br />out of the bed in the morning.
1117259 1120244 Make me feel like I belong in the world.<br />I don't bother nobody.
1120245 1123974 I just stay with my music 'cause that's the only<br />way I can find to live in the world.
1123975 1126364 Otherwise there ain't no telling<br />what I might do.
1126365 1129438 Now I don't come criticizing you and how you live.
1129439 1131816 I just come by to ask you for ten dollars
1131817 1133784 I don't wanna hear all that about how I live!
1133785 1136518 Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.
1136519 1139518 You can't change me, Pop.<br />I'm thirty-four years old.
1139876 1143291 If you wanted to change me, you should have<br />been there when I was growing up.
1143292 1144967 I come by to see you
1144968 1148101 ask for ten dollars and you want to talk about<br />how I was raised.
1148690 1151324 You don't know nothing about how I was raised.
1157374 1160290 Let the boy have ten dollars, Troy.
1164219 1166009 What the hell you looking at me for?
1166010 1169171 I ain't got no ten dollars.<br />You know what I do with my money.

1185259 1188539 You ought to stop telling that lie. Here, Lyons.
1188540 1189973 Thanks, Rose.
1194637 1196444 Look, I got to run. I'll see you later.
1196445 1198865 Wait a minute. You gonna say, "thanks, Rose,"
1198866 1200713 and ain't gonna look to see where<br />she got that ten dollars from?
1200714 1202737 - See how they do me, Bono?<br />- I know she got it from you, Pop.
1202738 1205166 - Thanks. I'll give it back to you.<br />- There he go telling another lie.
1205167 1207655 Time I see that ten dollars,<br />he'll be owing me thirty more.

1221203 1224853 - The boy is thirty- four years old.<br />- Let's not get off into all that.
1224854 1227732 Look here, I got to be going. I got to be<br />getting on. Lucille gonna be waiting.
1227733 1229444 See this woman, Bono?
1230450 1232195 I love this woman.
1232196 1235377 I love her so much it hurts.
1235378 1239765 I love her so much,<br />I done run out of ways of loving her.
1239766 1242520 So I got to get back to basics.
1242521 1245292 Don't you come by my house Monday morning<br />talking about time to go to work
1245293 1247318 - 'cause I'm still gonna be stroking!<br />- Troy! Stop it now!
1247319 1250676 I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.<br />That ain't nothing but gin-talk.
1250677 1252996 Go on, Troy. I'll see you Monday.
1252997 1254814 Don't you come by my house, nigger!
1257189 1259406 I done told you what I'm gonna be doing.
1261666 1264059 Come back home Tuesday!
1289708 1293226 Jesus be a fence
1293227 1297883 all around me every day
1302955 1304620 Morning.
1305150 1307145 You ready for breakfast? I can fix it
1307146 1309363 as soon I finish hanging up these clothes.
1309364 1311472 I got the coffee on. That's all right.
1311473 1314694 I'll just have some of that this morning.
1316208 1318596 That 651 hit yesterday.
1318597 1321895 That's the second time this month.<br />Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.
1321896 1324377 seem like those that need the least<br />always get lucky.
1324378 1327142 - Poor folks can't get nothing.<br />- Them numbers don't know nobody.
1327143 1329273 I don't know why you fool with them.<br />You and Lyons both.
1329274 1330752 It's something to do.
1330753 1333033 You ain't doing nothing but<br />throwing your money away.
1333034 1336588 Troy, you know I don't play foolishly. I just<br />play a nickel here and a nickel there.
1336589 1338034 That's two nickels you done thrown away.
1338035 1340664 Now I hit sometimes that makes up for it.
1340665 1343715 It always come in handy when I do hit.<br />I don't hear you complaining then.
1343716 1345692 I ain't complaining now. I just say it's foolish.
1345693 1348553 Trying to guess out of six hundred ways which way<br />the number gonna come.
1348554 1351084 If I had all the moneythese niggers
1353954 1357698 these Negroes, throw away on numbers for<br />one week,
1357699 1360840 just one week, I'd be a rich man.
1360841 1362465 Well, you wishing and calling it foolish
1362466 1365715 ain't gonna stop folks from playing numbers.<br />That's one thing for sure.
1366169 1369262 Besides some good things come from playing<br />numbers.
1369263 1372279 Look where Pope done bought him that<br />restaurant off of numbers.
1372280 1374656 I can't stand niggers like that.
1375110 1377566 Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.
1377567 1381788 He run around with his shoes all run over<br />bumming money for cigarettes.
1381789 1384586 All right. Got lucky there and
1384587 1387743 - Hit the numbers...<br />- Troy, I know all about it.
1387744 1389452 Had good sense, I'll say that for him.<br />He ain't throwed his money away.
1389453 1393093 I seen niggers hit the numbers and go through<br />two thousand dollars in four days.
1393094 1397607 Man built that restaurant down there<br />fixed it up real nice too
1397608 1399551 Then he won't let nobody come in it.
1399552 1402030 A Negro go in there and can't get no<br />kind of service.
1402031 1405170 I seen a white fellow come in there<br />and order a bowl of stew.
1405171 1407837 Pope picked all the meat out the pot for him.
1407838 1409907 Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!
1409908 1413984 Negro come behind him and ain't got nothing<br />but the potatoes and carrots.
1413985 1416790 Talking about what numbers do for people,<br />you picked a wrong example.
1416791 1420763 Ain't done nothing but make a worser fool out of him<br />than he was before.
1422331 1424195 Troy...
1424196 1427260 you ought to stop worrying about what<br />happened at work yesterday.
1429232 1430922 I ain't worried.
1432600 1434744 Just called me down there at the<br />commissioner's office on Friday.
1434745 1437350 Everybody worried about firing me.
1437351 1439504 I ain't worried about them firing me.
1439949 1441756 You ain't got to worry about that.
1442686 1444572 Where's Cory? Cory in the house?
1447836 1450163 He gone out.
1450164 1452364 Out, huh? He gone out
1452365 1455326 'cause he know I want him<br />to work on this fence.
1455327 1458710 I know how he is. That boy scared of work.<br />He ain't done a lick of work in his life.
1458711 1460245 He had to go to football practice.
1460246 1463487 Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice<br />before the season start.
1463488 1465357 I got his practice allright.
1465358 1467661 running out of here before<br />he get his chores done.
1467662 1470650 Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?<br />Don't nothing set right with you.
1470651 1473202 Go on back in there and go to bed<br />get up on the other side.
1473203 1475578 Why something got to be wrong with me?<br />I ain't said nothing wrong with me.
1475579 1477160 You got something to say about everything.
1477161 1479430 First it's the numbers then it's the way the man<br />runs his restaurant
1479431 1482375 then you done got on Cory.<br />What's it gonna be next?
1482376 1484502 Take a look up there and see<br />if the weather suits you
1484503 1487607 or is it gonna be how you gonna put up the fence<br />with the clothes hanging in the yard.
1487608 1489274 You hit the nail on the head then.
1489275 1491522 I know you like I know the back of my hand.
1491523 1493575 Come on in here and get you some more coffee
1493576 1496731 see if that straighten you up.<br />'Cause you ain't right this morning.
1504680 1506073 So...

1627128 1629724 Did you know when I was in Heaven
1629725 1632865 every morning me and Saint Peter would sit down<br />by the Gate and eat some
1632866 1635552 big fat biscuits?
1635553 1638166 Oh, yeah! We had us a good time.
1638167 1640637 We'd sit<br />there and eat us them biscuits
1640638 1644505 and then Saint Peter would go off to sleep<br />and tell me to wake him up
1644506 1646799 when it's time to open the Gates for the Judg-<br />ment.
1646800 1649744 Well, come on, I'll make up a batch of biscuits.
1651106 1654583 Troy, Saint Peter got your name in the<br />book.

1754362 1756814 Well, all you hypocrite members,

1801332 1804223 My God is coming
1809151 1810676 Where's Gabe?
1811387 1813164 He gone off somewhere.
1815788 1817113 He ain't eating right.
1817114 1818988 Miss Pearl say she can't<br />get him to eat nothing.
1818989 1820557 What you want me to do about it, Rose?
1820558 1823210 I done did everything I can for the man.<br />I can't make him get well.
1823639 1826525 Man got half his head blown away<br />what you expect?
1826853 1829089 Seem like something ought to be done to help him.
1829090 1830908 Man don't bother nobody.
1830909 1832709 He just mixed up from that metal plate
1832710 1834894 he got in his head. Ain't no sense...
1835474 1838700 Ain't no sense to send him to the hospital.
1838701 1841776 Least he be eating right. They can help<br />him take care of himself.
1841777 1844990 Don't nobody wanna be locked up, Rose.<br />What you wanna lock the man up for?
1844991 1846918 Man go down there
1846919 1850857 and fight the war messin' around<br />with them Japs,
1851396 1852955 get<br />half his head blown off
1852956 1856561 and they give him a lousy three thousand dollars.<br />And I had to swoop down on that.
1856562 1859854 - Is you fixing to go into that again?<br />- He got a metal plate in his head
1859855 1863986 That's the only way I got a roof over<br />my head 'cause of that metal plate.
1863987 1866341 Ain't no sense you blaming yourself for nothing.
1866342 1868316 Gabe wasn't in no condition to manage that money.
1868317 1871466 You done what was right by him. Can't nobody say<br />you ain't done what was right by him.
1871467 1873102 Look how long you took care of him
1873103 1875840 till he wanted to have his own place<br />and moved over there with Miss Pearl.
1875841 1878125 That ain't what I'm saying, woman!<br />I'm just...
1880355 1882436 just stating the facts.
1882437 1884635 If my brother didn't have that<br />metal plate in his head
1884636 1889116 I wouldn't have a pot to piss in or a window<br />to throw it out of. And I'm fifty-three
1898842 1900560 Where you going off to?
1900561 1904406 You been running out of here every Saturday for weeks.<br />I thought you was gonna work on this fence?

2101255 2102575 I was just getting ready to do my chores now,<br />Pop
2102576 2106231 Your first chore is to help me with this fence<br />on Saturday. Everything else come after that.
2106232 2108734 Now get that saw and cut them boards.
2112726 2114064 Hey, Pop
2114065 2115823 why don't you buy a TV?
2115824 2118191 What I want with a TV?<br />What I want one of them for?
2118192 2121613 Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse!
2121614 2123864 I ain't asked you who had one.<br />I say what I want with one?
2123865 2127269 So you can watch it. They got lots of things on<br />TV. Baseball games and everything.
2127270 2128945 - Yeah?<br />- We could watch the World Series.
2128946 2130604 Yeah. And how much this TV cost?
2130605 2133149 I don't know. They got them on sale for around<br />two hundred dollars.
2133555 2135696 - Two hundred dollars, huh?<br />- That ain't that much, Pop.
2135697 2137456 Naw, it's just two hundred dollars.
2138930 2141433 See that roof you got over your head at night?
2141434 2143203 Let me tell you something about that roof.
2143204 2147641 It's been ten years since<br />that roof was last tarred.
2147642 2151020 See now, the snow come this winter<br />and sit up there on that roof like it is
2151021 2154105 and it's gonna seep inside. It's just gonna be a little bit<br />ain't gonna hardly notice it.
2154106 2156782 Then the next thing you know,<br />it's gonna be leaking all over the house.
2156783 2160613 Then the wood rot from all that<br />water and you gonna need a whole new roof.
2160614 2162986 Now, how much you think it cost<br />to get that roof tarred?
2162987 2167530 - I don't know.<br />- Two hundred and sixty-four dollars, cash money.
2167531 2170754 While you thinking about a TV, I got to be<br />thinking about the roof
2170755 2172606 and whatever else go wrong around here.
2173391 2175617 Now if you had two hundred dollars, what would you do
2175618 2177537 fix the roof or buy a TV?
2177538 2179018 I'd buy a TV.
2179019 2182037 Then when the roof started to leak<br />when it needed fixing, I'd fix it.
2182038 2184671 Where are you gonna get the money from?<br />You done spent it for a TV.
2184672 2188156 You gonna sit up and watch the<br />water run all over your brand-new TV.
2188157 2189788 Aw, Pop. You got money. I know you do.
2189789 2191532 - Where I got it at, huh?<br />- You got it in the bank.
2191533 2196003 You wanna see my bankbook? You wanna see that<br />$73.22 I got sitting up in there?
2196004 2199402 You ain't got to pay for it all at one time. You can<br />put a down payment on it and carry it home with you.
2199403 2202246 Not me. I ain't gonna owe nobody nothing<br />if I can help it.
2202247 2205757 Miss a payment and they come and snatch it<br />right out your house. Then what you got?
2207107 2210139 Now, when I get two hundred dollars clear,
2210140 2211980 then I'll buy me a TV.
2211981 2216010 Right now, as soon as I get 264 dollars,<br />I'm gonna have this roof tarred.- Aw, Pop!
2216011 2219101 You go on and get you two hundred dollars and<br />buy one if ya want it.
2219102 2220749 I got better things to do with my money.
2220750 2223185 I can't get no two hundred dollars.<br />I ain't never seen two hundred dollars.
2223186 2224781 II'll tell you what...
2224782 2227930 you get a hundred dollars and<br />I'll put the other hundred with it.
2227931 2229536 All right, I'm gonna show you.
2229537 2232387 You gonna show me how you can cut<br />them boards right now.
2233137 2234581 Here you go.
2234582 2236430 200 dollars worth.
2238388 2240671 The Pirates won today.
2240672 2243157 - That makes five in a row.<br />- I ain't thinking about the Pirates.
2243158 2245735 Got an all white team.<br />Got that boy
2245736 2247547 that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente.
2247548 2251482 Don't even half-play him. That boy could be something<br />if they give him a chance.
2251483 2253559 Play him one day and sit him on the bench<br />the next.
2253560 2254948 He gets a lot of chances to play.
2254949 2258651 I'm talking about playing regular. Playing every day.<br />so you can get your timing.That's what I'm talking about.
2258652 2260612 They got some white guys on the team<br />that don't play every day.
2260613 2262221 You can't play everybody at the same time.
2262222 2266231 If they got a white fellow sitting on the bench,<br />you can bet your last dollar he can't play!
2266232 2268838 The colored guy got to be twice as good<br />before he get on the team.
2268839 2271660 That's why I don't want you to get<br />all tied up in them sports.
2271661 2273657 Man on the team and what it get him?
2273658 2276046 They got colored on the team<br />and don't use them.
2276047 2277471 Same as not having them.
2277472 2279118 All them teams the same.
2279119 2281125 The Braves got Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.
2281126 2283081 Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.<br />That makes forty- three.
2283082 2285723 Hank Aaron ain't nobody.<br />That's what you supposed to do.
2285724 2288663 That's how you supposed to play the game.<br />Ain't nothing to it.
2288664 2292152 It's just a matter of timing getting the right follow-through.<br />Hell, I can hit forty-three home runs right now!
2292153 2293461 Not off no major-league pitching, you couldn't.
2293462 2295419 We had better pitching in the Negro leagues.
2295420 2298432 I hit seven home runs off of Satchel Paige.<br />You can't get no better than that!
2298433 2300047 Sandy Koufax. He's leading the league in strike-outs.
2300048 2301819 I ain't thinking of no Sandy Koufax.
2301820 2303479 You got Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette...
2303480 2305165 I'm through with it now.
2308946 2310775 You go on and cut them boards.
2313344 2317873 Your mama tell me you done got recruited by a<br />college football team? Is that right?
2318267 2321716 Yeah. Coach Zellman say the recruiter gonna be<br />coming by to talk to you.
2321717 2323686 Get you to sign the permission papers.
2323687 2327235 I thought you supposed to be working down there at the A&P.<br />Ain't you supposed to be working down there after school?
2327236 2328663 Mr. Stawicki say he gonna
2328664 2330754 hold my job for me until after the football season.
2330755 2333397 Say starting next week I can work weekends.
2333398 2336415 I thought we had an understanding<br />about this football stuff?
2336416 2340005 You suppose to keep up with your chores and<br />hold that job down at the A&P.
2340006 2342392 Ain't been around here all day on a Saturday.
2342393 2345476 Ain't none of your chores done and now you<br />telling me you done quit your job.
2345477 2347593 - I'm gonna be working weekends.<br />- You damn right you are!
2347594 2350968 And ain't no need for nobody coming around here<br />to talk to me about signing nothing.
2350969 2352931 Hey, Pop, you can't do that. He's coming<br />all the way from North Carolina.
2352932 2355062 I don't care where he coming from.
2355063 2356610 Look, boy.
2357242 2361105 The white man ain't gonna let you get nowhere<br />with that football no way.
2361106 2363165 You go on and get your book-learning<br />so you can...
2363166 2365028 work yourself up in that A&P
2365029 2367536 or learn how to fix cars or build houses<br />or something,
2367537 2370532 get you a trade. That way you have something can't<br />nobody take away from you.
2370917 2372901 You go on and learn how to put<br />your hands to some good use.
2372902 2375425 Besides hauling people's garbage.

2487441 2489015 - Why you think that is?<br />- 'Cause of you.
2489016 2491284 Aw, hell, I know it's 'cause of me
2491285 2493275 but why do you think that is?
2494693 2496283 'Cause you like me.
2496673 2498200 Like you?
2498547 2500456 I go out of here every morning
2500457 2503950 bust my butt putting up with them crackers<br />every day
2503951 2505665 'cause I like you?
2505666 2507748 You about the biggest fool I ever saw.
2507749 2510768 It's my job. It's my responsibility!
2510769 2513814 A man is supposed to take care of his family.
2513815 2516769 You live in my house,<br />fill you belly up with my food,
2516770 2519941 put your behind on my bed,<br />because you are my son.
2520599 2523442 Not 'cause I like you!<br />'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.
2523443 2525754 I owe a responsibility to you!
2525755 2529669 Let's get this straight right here,<br />before it go along any further
2529670 2531316 I ain't got to like you.
2531317 2534337 Mr. Rand don't give me my money come payday<br />'cause he likes me.
2534338 2536562 He give it to me, 'cause he owe me.
2537538 2539670 I done give you everything I got to give you.
2539671 2541428 I gave you your life!
2541846 2543736 Me and your mama worked that out between us.
2543737 2546482 And liking your black ass wasn't part<br />of the bargain.
2546917 2550757 Don't you try and go through life worrying about<br />if somebody like you or not.
2550758 2553746 You best be making sure they doing right by you.
2553747 2555406 - You understand what I'm saying, boy?<br />- Yessir.
2555407 2559079 Then get the hell out of my face, and get on<br />down to that A&P.
2582211 2584804 Why don't you let the boy go ahead<br />and play football, Troy?
2584805 2586750 He just want to be like you with the sports.
2586751 2588459 I don't want him to be like me!
2588888 2591876 I want him to move as far away from my life<br />as possibly he can get.
2591877 2594164 You the only decent thing that<br />ever happened to me.
2594610 2595968 I wish him that.
2595969 2598756 But I don't wish him nothing else<br />from my life.
2600353 2604623 I decided seventeen years ago that boy wasn't<br />getting involved in no sports.
2604624 2606385 Not after what they did to me in the sports.
2606386 2608896 Troy, why don't you admit you was too old to<br />play in the major leagues?
2608897 2610256 For once, why don't you admit that?
2610257 2612169 Don't come telling me, I was too old.
2612170 2613980 I just wasn't the right color.
2613981 2618678 I'm fifty-three years old and can do better<br />than Selkirk's�.269 right now!
2618679 2621152 How's was you gonna play ball<br />when you were over forty?
2621153 2622891 Sometimes I can't get no sense out of you.
2622892 2624900 I got good sense, woman. I got sense enough
2624901 2627237 not to let that boy get hurt over<br />playing no sports.
2627238 2628985 You're mothering that boy too much.
2628986 2631514 Worried about if people like him or not.
2631515 2634025 Everything that boy do, he do for you.
2634556 2637473 He wants you to say, "Good job, son."<br />That's all.
2637474 2639141 I ain't got time for that. Rose.
2639142 2640748 He's alive.<br />He's healthy.
2640749 2643368 He's got to make his own way. I made mine.
2644239 2646914 Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand<br />when he get out there in that world.
2646915 2648545 Times have changed from when you was young,<br />Troy.
2649285 2650963 People change.
2651462 2654064 The world's changing around you<br />and you can't even see it.
2660066 2662297 Woman, I do the best I can do.
2662959 2667242 I come in here every Friday. I carry a sack of<br />potatoes and a bucket of lard.
2667243 2669675 You all line up at the door with your hands out.
2670784 2674891 I give you the lint from my pockets.<br />I give you my sweat and my blood.
2674892 2677004 I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.
2677005 2680251 We go upstairs in that room at night<br />and I fall down on you
2680252 2682584 and try to blast a hole into forever.
2683659 2687600 I get up Monday morning find my lunch on the table.<br />I go out. Make my way.
2687601 2690307 Find my strength to carry me<br />through to the next Friday.
2692061 2693872 That's all I got, Rose.
2696209 2699481 All I got to give.
2703141 2705429 I can't give nothing<br />else!
2731733 2733448 Mr. Maxson?
2736010 2738001 The commissioner will see you now.
2744869 2746529 Rose!
2749482 2751373 Hey, Rose!
2751374 2755360 I wish I could have seen Mr. Rand's face<br />when he told you.
2755361 2758361 He couldn't get it out of his mouth!<br />Liked to bit his tongue!
2758362 2762131 When they called me down there to the commissioner's office<br />he thought they was gonna fire me.
2762132 2765215 - Like everybody else.<br />- I didn't think they was gonna fire you.
2765216 2767198 I thought they was gonna put you on<br />the warning paper.
2767199 2768702 Hey, Rose!
2768703 2770932 Yeah, Mr. Rand like to bit his tongue.
2770933 2774438 I see you run right down to Taylors'<br />and told that Alberta gal.
2774439 2776343 Hey, Rose! I told everybody.
2776344 2777922 Hey, Rose!
2777923 2779845 I went down there to cash my check.
2781757 2785369 Hush all that hollering, man! I know you out here.<br />What they say down there at the commissioner's office?
2785370 2787321 You supposed to come when I call you, woman.
2787322 2789786 Bono'll tell you that.<br />Don't Lucille come when you call her?
2789787 2792805 Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog talk about<br />"come when you call me."
2792806 2795990 You hear this, Bono? I had me an old dog<br />used to get uppity like that. You say,
2795991 2798080 "C'mere, Blue!" and he just lay there<br />and look at you.
2798081 2800305 End up getting a stick and chasing him away<br />trying to make him come.
2800306 2802394 I ain't studying you and your dog.
2802395 2803851 I remember you used to sing that old song.
2803852 2806024 Hear it ring! Hear it ring!
2806025 2807811 Had an old dog his name was Blue.
2807812 2809628 Don't nobody want to hear you sing<br />that old song.
2810224 2812073 You know Blue was mighty true.
2812074 2814417 Used to have Cory running around here<br />singing that song.
2814418 2816179 Hell, I remember that song myself.
2816180 2818743 You know Blue was a good old dog.
2818744 2821183 Blue treed a possum in a hollow log.
2821184 2823744 That was my daddy's song.<br />My daddy made up that song.
2823745 2826449 I don't care who made it up.<br />Don't nobody wanna hear you sing it.
2826450 2828863 Come here, woman.
2828864 2831267 You come in here carrying on,<br />I reckon they ain't fired you.
2831776 2833861 What they say down there at the<br />commissioner's office?
2833862 2837168 Look here, Rose, Mr. Rand called me<br />into his office today
2837169 2839481 when I got back from talking to them people<br />down there
2839482 2841851 he called me in and told me...
2843395 2845375 ... they was making me a driver.
2845376 2847135 Troy, you're kidding!
2847136 2849026 No I ain't. Ask Bono.
2849027 2851194 Well, that's great, Troy. Now you don't have to<br />hassle them people no more.
2851195 2852883 Aw hell...
2852884 2856188 I didn't think, I'd see you today.<br />I thought you was in jail.
2856189 2858573 Got it all over the front page of the Courier<br />about them raiding Seefus' place
2858574 2861032 where you be hanging out with<br />all them thugs.
2861033 2863033 Hey, Pop, that ain't got nothing to do<br />with me.
2863034 2866486 I don't go down there gambling.<br />I go down there to sit in with the band.
2866487 2868536 I ain't got nothing to do with the gambling part.
2868537 2871721 - They got some good music down there.<br />- They got some rogues is what they got.
2871722 2874074 How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.
2874075 2876823 I see where you playing down<br />at the Crawford Grill tonight.
2876824 2879177 How come you ain't brought Bonnie like I told you.<br />You should have brought Bonnie with you,
2879178 2880713 she ain't been over in a month of Sundays.
2880714 2882896 I was just in the neighborhood,<br />thought I'd stop by.
2882897 2885632 - Here he come.<br />- Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.
2885633 2888195 He's gonna be the first colored driver.
2888196 2891201 Ain't got to do nothing but sit up there and<br />read the paper like them white fellows.
2891202 2894066 Hey, Pop, if you knew how to read<br />you'd be all right.
2894067 2897881 Naw, naw, you mean if the nigger knew<br />how to drive he'd be all right.
2897882 2901297 Been fighting with them people about driving<br />and ain't even got alicense.
2901298 2903304 Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license?
2903305 2905391 Driving ain't nothing. All you do is point the truck
2905392 2907376 where you want it to go. Driving ain't nothing.
2907377 2910127 Do they know you ain't got no driver's license?<br />That's what I'm talking about.
2910128 2913586 I ain't asked if driving was easy. I asked if Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license.
2913587 2915039 He ain't got to know.<br />The man ain't got to know my business.
2915040 2917439 Time he find out, I have two or three driver's licenses.
2917440 2919545 - Say, look here, Pop...<br />- I knew it was coming.
2919546 2922594 I know what kind of "look here, Pop" that was.<br />The nigger fixing to ask me for some money.
2922595 2924795 It's Friday night. It's my payday.
2924796 2928344 All them rogues down there on the avenue<br />the ones that ain't in jail
2928345 2931241 and Lyons is hopping in his shoes to<br />get down there with them.
2931242 2934519 See, Pop, if you'd give somebody else a<br />chance to talk sometime
2934520 2938590 you'd see that I was fixing to pay you back<br />your ten dollars like I told you.
2938591 2941720 Here, I told you I'd pay you when Bon-<br />nie got paid.
2941721 2944036 Naw, you go ahead and keep that ten dollars.<br />Put it in the bank.
2944037 2947460 The next time you feel like you wanna come by here and<br />ask me for something you go on down there and get that.
2947461 2952038 Here's your ten dollars, Pop. I told you I don't want you<br />to give me nothing. I just wanted to borrow ten dollars.
2952039 2954956 Naw, you keep that for the next<br />time you want to ask me.
2954957 2958236 - Come on, Pop, here go your ten dollars.<br />- Troy, Why don't you let the boy pay you back?
2962254 2963854 Here you go, Rose.
2963855 2966827 If you don't take it I'm gonna have to hear about it<br />for the next six months.
2966828 2968565 You can hand yours over here too, Troy.
2968566 2970249 You see this Bono, you see how they do me?
2970250 2972179 Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.
2972180 2975888 Better get ready for the judgement!
2976829 2980700 Better get ready for...
2981058 2983637 Hey! Hey! There's Troy's boy!
2983638 2985433 - How you doing, Uncle Gabe?<br />- Lyons...
2987915 2990042 The King of the jungle!
2991034 2993763 Rose, hey, Rose. Got a flower for you.
2993764 2996522 Picked it myself.<br />That's the same rose like you is!
2996523 2998528 That's right nice of you, Gabe.
2998529 2999966 What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?
2999967 3002189 Oh, I been chasing hellhounds
3002190 3005385 and waiting on the time to tell<br />Saint Peter to open the Gates.

3007024 3010308 you doing the right thing, Uncle Gabe.<br />Somebody got to chase them.
3010309 3011807 Oh, yeah, I know it.
3011808 3014903 The devil's strong.<br />The devil ain't no pushover.
3014904 3017640 Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.
3017641 3020293 But I got my trumpet waiting on the Judgment time.
3020294 3021993 Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?
3021994 3023937 Ain't gonna be too much of a battle
3023938 3026602 when God get to waving that Judgment sword.
3027629 3030693 But the people's gonna have a hell of a time<br />trying to get into Heaven
3030694 3032445 if them Gates ain't open.
3032446 3033891 You hear this, Pop?
3033892 3037356 - Uncle Gabe, you all right!<br />- Lyons!
3039710 3041207 The King of the Jungle.
3041208 3043525 You're staying for supper, Gabe?<br />You want me to fix you a plate?
3043526 3046505 I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.<br />I don't want no plate.
3046506 3048756 I wanna eat with my hands.<br />I'll take a sandwich.
3048757 3051317 How about you, Lyons? You staying?<br />Got some short ribs cooking.
3051318 3053916 Naw, I won't eat nothing till<br />after we finished playing.
3055012 3057302 You ought to come down and<br />listen to me play, Pop.
3057303 3060057 I don't like that Chinese music. All that noise.
3060058 3062656 Go on in the house and wash up, Gabe.<br />I'll fix you a sandwich.
3063067 3064937 Troy's mad at me.
3066031 3067406 What you mad at Uncle Gabe for, Pop?
3067407 3070251 He thinks Troy's mad at him<br />'cause he moved over to Miss Pearl's.
3070252 3072602 I ain't mad at the man.<br />He can live where he want to live at.
3072603 3074888 What he move over there for?<br />Miss Pearl don't like nobody.
3074889 3076627 She don't mind him none.<br />She treats him real nice.
3076628 3078068 She just don't allow all that singing.
3078069 3080733 She don't mind that rent he be paying<br />that's what she don't mind.
3080734 3082334 Troy, I ain't going through<br />that with you no more.
3082335 3085401 He's over there 'cause he want to have his<br />own place. He can come and go as he please.
3085402 3086934 Hell, he could come and go as he please here.
3086935 3089089 I wasn't stopping him.<br />I ain't put no rules on him.
3089090 3090925 It ain't the same thing, Troy.<br />And you know it.
3090926 3092366 Now, that's the last I wanna hear about that.
3092367 3094587 I don't wanna hear nothing else<br />about Gabe and Miss Pearl.
3094588 3097267 - And next week...<br />- I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

3102296 3104159 Then that'll be the last I have to hear about that.
3108579 3110577 Cory got recruited? What school he<br />going to?
3110578 3112183 I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.
3112184 3114443 That boy walking around here<br />smelling his piss.
3114444 3117564 Thinking he's gonna do what he want,<br />regardless of what I say.
3118365 3119745 Look here, Bono
3119746 3122307 I left the commissioner's office and<br />went down to the A&P
3122308 3124586 that boy ain't working down there.<br />He lying to me.
3124587 3126346 Telling me he got his job back
3126347 3128224 telling me he working weekends
3128225 3129710 telling me he working after school
3129711 3132051 Mr. Stawicki tell me he ain't<br />working down there at all!
3132052 3133375 Cory just growing up.
3133376 3135506 He's just busting at the seams<br />trying to fill out your shoes.
3135507 3136830 I don't care what he's doing.
3136831 3138957 When he get to the point where<br />he wanna disobey me
3138958 3140552 then it's time for him to move on.
3140553 3142214 Bono'll tell you that.
3142215 3145364 I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy<br />without paying the consequences.
3146034 3147773 I ain't never had a chance.
3148192 3151770 My daddy came on through.<br />But I ain't never knew him to see him.
3151771 3154448 or what he had on his mind or<br />where he went.
3154449 3156308 Just moving on through.
3156309 3158659 Searching out the New Land.
3158971 3161343 That's what the old folks used to call it.
3161344 3162966 See a fellow moving around
3162967 3164948 from place to place, woman to woman
3164949 3167336 called it "Searching out the New Land."
3167337 3169540 I can't say if he ever found it.
3169998 3172572 I come along, didn't want no kids.
3172846 3175166 I didn't know if I was gonna be<br />in one place long enough
3175167 3176895 to fix on them right as their daddy.
3176896 3178966 I figured I was going searching too.
3178967 3181716 As it turned out I been hooked up with Lucille
3181717 3184043 near about as long as your daddy been with Rose.
3184044 3186128 Going on sixteen years.
3186129 3188264 Sometimes I wish I had never known my daddy.
3188265 3190044 He ain't cared nothing about no kids.
3190045 3192418 A kid to him wasn't nothing.
3192419 3195502 All he wanted you to do<br />was learn how to walk
3195503 3197485 so he could start you to working.
3197486 3199317 When it come time for eating,<br />he ate first.
3199318 3201071 If there was anything left over,<br />that's what you got.
3201072 3204528 Man would sit down and eat two<br />chickens and give you the wing.
3204529 3207565 You ought to stop that, Pop.<br />Everybody feed their kids.
3207566 3212379 No matter how hard times is everybody care about<br />their kids.Make sure they have something to eat.
3212380 3214008 The only thing my daddy cared about was
3214009 3216008 getting them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.
3216009 3217904 That's the only thing that mattered to him.
3217905 3220457 Sometimes I used to wonder<br />why he was still living.
3220458 3223068 Wonder why the devil hadn't come<br />and got him.
3223069 3225073 "Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin."
3225074 3226476 and find out he owe him money
3226477 3228780 He should have just went on and left<br />when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.
3228781 3230081 That's what I would have done.
3230082 3232907 How he gonna leave with eleven kids?<br />And where he gonna go?
3232908 3234977 He ain't knew how to do nothing but farm.
3234978 3237831 No, he was trapped and I think he knew it.
3237832 3239360 But I'll say this for him
3239766 3241741 he felt a responsibility toward us.
3241742 3243688 Maybe he ain't treated us the<br />way I felt he should have
3243689 3245528 but without that responsibility
3245529 3247448 he could have run off and left us
3247449 3249172 made his own way.
3249173 3250580 A lot of them did.
3250581 3252486 Back in those days what you talking about
3252487 3257485 they walk out their front door and just take on down<br />one road or another and just keep on walking.
3257486 3259092 There you go! That's what I'm talking about.
3259093 3262009 Just keep on walking till you come<br />to something else.
3262588 3265713 Ain't you never heard of nobody having<br />the walking blues?
3266074 3268900 Well, that's what you call it when<br />you just take off like that.
3268901 3272455 My daddy ain't had them walking blues!
3272456 3274593 He stayed right there with his family.
3274594 3278739 But he was just as evil as he could be.
3279078 3282392 My mama couldn't stand him.<br />Couldn't stand that evilness.
3282393 3285025 She run off when I was about eight.
3285026 3287346 She sneaked off one night after<br />he had gone to sleep.
3287347 3290624 Told me she was coming back for me.<br />I ain't never seen her no more.
3290625 3294935 All his women run off and left him.<br />He wasn't good for nobody.
3295452 3299274 When my turn come to head out,<br />I was fourteen
3299275 3301995 and got to sniffing around Joe Canewell's daughter.
3302881 3305522 Had us an old mule we called Greyboy.
3305523 3308549 My daddy sent me out to do some plowing
3308550 3310899 I got fooling around with Joe<br />Canewell's daughter.
3311201 3314792 We done found us a nice spot,<br />got real cozy with each other.
3314793 3318098 She about thirteen and we done figured<br />we was grown anyway
3318099 3321470 So we down there enjoying ourselves,<br />ain't thinking about nothing.
3321883 3324359 We didn't know Greyboy had got loose
3324360 3327476 and wandered back to the house<br />and my daddy was looking for me.
3327477 3330686 We down there by the creek enjoying ourselves<br />when my daddy come up on us.
3331412 3333061 Surprised us.
3333647 3336291 He had them leather straps off the mule
3336292 3339538 and commenced to whupping me like<br />there was no tomorrow.
3339539 3342845 I jumped up, mad and embarrassed.
3342846 3344413 I was scared of my daddy.
3345028 3349135 When he commenced to whupping on me, quite<br />naturally I run to get out of the way.
3349136 3351583 Now I thought he was mad<br />'cause I ain't done my work.
3351584 3354574 But I see where he was chasing me off
3354575 3356716 so he could have the gal for himself.
3357589 3359995 When I see what the matter of it was,
3360703 3365212 I lost all fear of my daddy.<br />Right there is where I become a man
3365213 3367203 at fourteen years of age.
3367704 3369711 Now it was my turn to run him off.
3370482 3373878 I picked up them same reins that<br />he had used on me.
3373879 3376211 I picked up them reins and commenced<br />to whupping on him.
3376983 3379111 The gal jumped up and run off
3380890 3382442 and when he turned to face me,
3382443 3384557 I could see why the devil had never<br />come to get him
3384558 3386674 'cause he was the devil himself.
3388017 3390220 I don't know what happened.
3390511 3392457 When I woke up,
3392458 3397436 I was laying right there by the creek, and Blue<br />this old dog we had was licking my face.
3397437 3400231 Both my eyes were swollen shut.
3400755 3402886 I thought I was blind.<br />I couldn't see nothing.
3402887 3404516 I just laid there
3404517 3406597 cried...
3411759 3414226 I didn't know what I was gonna do.
3414747 3416871 But I knew it
3416872 3419605 time had come for me to leave<br />my daddy's house.
3420615 3422842 suddenly the world got big.
3426006 3428235 And it was a long time before<br />I could cut it down to
3428236 3429992 where I could handle it.
3431346 3434561 Part of this cutting down where I got to
3434562 3436754 place what I could feel him kicking in my blood,
3436755 3438885 I knew the only thing that separated us
3438886 3440439 was a matter of a few years.
3443626 3445650 What you got there, Uncle Gabe?
3445979 3449413 Got me a ham sandwich.<br />Rose gave me a ham sandwich.
3452079 3454776 I lost touch with everybody except Gabriel.
3459113 3460545 But...
3464036 3465696 I hope he's dead.
3469857 3472065 I hope he found some peace.
3472838 3474833 That's a heavy story, Pop.
3476083 3478809 I didn't know you left home<br />when you was fourteen.
3480042 3482344 Fourteen's kinda young to be out on your own.
3482345 3484058 I don't know what I would have done.
3485207 3488138 I got up from the creek and walked on<br />down to Mobile.
3488139 3490815 I was through with farming.<br />Figured I could do better in the city.
3490816 3493458 So I walked the two hundred miles to Mobile.
3493459 3496254 Wait a minute you ain't walked no two<br />hundred miles, Pop.
3497117 3499539 Ain't nobody gonna walk no<br />two hundred miles.
3499540 3501291 You talking about some walking<br />there.
3501292 3504388 That's the only way you got anywhere<br />back in them days.
3504389 3506787 Shhh. Damn if I wouldn't have hitched a ride<br />with somebody!
3507726 3510910 Who you gonna hitch it with? They ain't had no<br />cars and things like they got now.
3510911 3512471 We talking about 1918.
3512472 3514182 What you all out here getting into?
3514183 3516416 I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.
3516417 3518183 He don't know nothing about this I'm talking.
3518184 3520736 Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.<br />She say you supposed to pick her up.
3520737 3522111 Yeah, okay, Rose.
3522434 3524939 I walked on down to Mobile
3524940 3528255 and hitched up with some of them fellows<br />that was coming up this way.
3528256 3530106 Got up here and found out
3530107 3533316 not only couldn't you get a job<br />you couldn't find no place to live.
3533317 3536399 I thought I was in freedom. Shhh.
3536400 3539013 Colored folks living down there<br />on the riverbanks
3539014 3541358 in whatever kind of shelter<br />they could find for themselves.
3541359 3544022 Right down there under the Brady Street Bridge.
3544023 3548085 Living down in shacks made of sticks<br />and tar paper.
3548404 3552379 Messed around there and went from bad to worse.<br />Started stealing.
3552380 3554691 First it was food. Then I figured,
3554692 3557957 if I steal money I can buy me some food.<br />Buy me some shoes too!
3557958 3560706 One thing led to another. Met your mama.
3560707 3563007 I was young and anxious to be a man.
3563404 3566096 Met your mama and had you.<br />What I do that for?
3566097 3568440 Now I got to worry about feeding you and her.
3568441 3570118 Got to steal three times as much.
3570915 3573233 Went out one day looking for somebody to rob
3574004 3576085 that's what I was, a robber.
3576086 3577648 I'll tell you the truth.
3577649 3580220 I'm ashamed of it today. But it's the truth.
3580876 3584105 Went to rob this fellow pulled out my knife<br />and he pulled out a gun.
3584106 3585726 Shot me in the chest. It felt just like
3585727 3588325 somebody had taken a hot branding<br />iron and laid it on me.
3588326 3591695 When he shot me I jumped<br />at him with my knife.
3593216 3594981 They said I killed him
3595308 3599115 locked me up, put me in the penitentiary for fifteen years.<br />That's where I met Bono.
3599116 3601194 That's where I learned how to play baseball.
3601195 3602809 Got out that place and your mama had taken you
3602810 3605205 and went on to make a life without me.
3605206 3607437 Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.
3607438 3609931 But that fifteen years cured me of<br />that robbing stuff.
3609932 3611262 Rose'll tell you.
3611263 3612901 I first met her, she asked me
3612902 3615263 if I had gotten all that foolishness out of my system.
3615264 3618770 And I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball<br />all what count with me."
3618771 3620485 You hear me, Bono?<br />I meant it too.
3620486 3622181 She said, "Which one comes first?"
3622182 3625169 I said, "Baby, ain't no doubt it's baseball
3625170 3628617 but you stick and get old with me and<br />we'll both outlive this baseball. "
3628618 3629944 Am I right, Rose?
3632350 3635316 - And it's true.<br />- Man, hush your mouth. You ain't said no such thing.
3635317 3639552 Talking about, "Baby, you know you'll always be<br />number one with me." That's what you was talking.
3640447 3642156 That's why I love this woman.
3642157 3645218 Rose'll keep you straight. You get off the<br />track, she'll straighten you up.
3645219 3648003 Lyons, you better get on up and get Bonnie.<br />She waiting on you.
3648004 3649690 Hey, Pop,
3649691 3652318 why don't you come on down to the<br />Grill and hear me play?
3652319 3655676 I ain't going down there. I'm too old to be<br />hanging up them clubs.
3655677 3658705 You got to be good to play down at the Grill.
3658706 3660305 Come on, Pop
3660306 3663170 - I got to get up in the morning.<br />- You ain't got to stay long.
3664658 3668584 Naw, I eat my supper and go to bed.
3669870 3673274 Well, I gotta go. I'll see you later.
3676203 3678802 Don't you come around my house on my payday.
3678803 3681090 Pick up the phone and let somebody know<br />you coming.
3681091 3683170 And bring Bonnie in. You know<br />I'm always glad to see her.
3683171 3685746 Yeah, I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.
3686707 3688636 - See you, Pop.<br />- Bye.
3688637 3690014 See you, Mr. Bono.
3690579 3693725 - See you, Uncle Gabe.<br />- Lyons! King of the jungle!
3694883 3697971 Is supper ready, woman? Me and you got<br />some business to take care of.
3697972 3700078 - I'm gonna tear it up too.<br />- Troy, I done told you now!
3700079 3702254 Aw hell, woman this is Bono. Bono like family.

3707382 3709604 I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup.
3709605 3712995 - Me and him done been through some times.<br />- You sure right about that.
3712996 3715203 Hell, I done know him longer than I known you.
3715204 3717118 And we still standing shoulder to shoulder.
3717119 3720246 Hey, look here, Bono, a man can't ask for no more<br />than that.

3726197 3729068 You got yours in hand. I got to go get mine.
3730962 3732458 What you do that for, Pop?
3732459 3734319 What's the matter? Cory, what's the matter?
3734320 3737405 Papa done went up to the school and told Coach<br />Zellman I can't play football no more.
3737406 3738991 Wouldn't even let me play the game.
3738992 3740601 Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.
3740602 3742257 - Troy...<br />- What you Troying me for.

3744092 3746154 Why you wanna do that to me?<br />That was the one chance I had.
3746155 3748973 - Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.<br />- The boy lied to me.
3748974 3751147 I told the nigger if he wanna play football
3751148 3754162 to keep up his chores and hold down<br />that job at the A&P.
3754163 3755480 That was the conditions.
3755481 3759203 - Stopped down there to see Mr. Stawicki<br />- I can't work after school during the football season, Pop!
3759631 3762175 I tried to tell you that Mr. Stawicki's<br />holding my job for me.
3762176 3764935 You don't never want to listen to nobody.<br />And then you wanna go and do this to me!
3764936 3766625 I ain't done nothing to you.<br />You done it to yourself
3766626 3770391 Just 'cause you didn't get a chance! You just<br />scared I'm gonna be better than you, that's all.

3977556 3979231 All they want is the money.
3979232 3981997 That makes six or seven times I done went down<br />there and got him.
3981998 3984274 See me coming they stick out their hands.
3984275 3987217 Yeah. I know what you mean. That's all they care<br />about that money.
3987218 3989349 They don't care about what's right.
3990345 3992070 Nigger,...
3992071 3995178 why you got to go and get some hard wood?
3995179 3997520 You ain't doing nothing but building<br />a little old fence.
3997521 3999348 Get you some soft pine wood.<br />That's all you need.
3999349 4001382 I know what I'm doing. This is outside wood.
4001383 4003578 You put pine wood inside the house.
4003579 4006299 Pine wood is inside wood.<br />This here is outside wood.
4006637 4008561 Now you tell me where the fence is gonna be?
4009986 4012128 You don't need this wood.
4012129 4016072 You can put it up with pine wood and it'll stand<br />as long as you gonna be here looking at it.
4016073 4019040 How you know how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?<br />Hell, I might just live forever.
4019355 4021954 Live longer than old man Horsely.
4021955 4023978 That's what Magee used to say.
4023979 4026571 Magee's a damn fool. Now you tell me who you<br />ever heard of gonna pull
4026572 4029546 their own teeth with a pair of rusty pliers.
4029547 4032676 The old folks my granddaddy used to pull<br />his teeth with pliers.
4032677 4035078 They ain't had no dentists<br />for the colored folks back then.
4035079 4037612 Get clean pliers! You understand? Clean pliers!
4037613 4038929 Sterilize them!
4038930 4040750 Besides we ain't living back then.
4040751 4043084 All Magee had to do was go down to<br />Doc Goldblum's.
4043085 4046477 I see where you and that Tallahassee gal<br />that Alberta
4046478 4049688 - I see where you all done got tight.<br />- What you mean, "got tight"?
4049689 4052129 I see where you be laughing and joking with her<br />all the time.
4052130 4054929 I laughs and jokes with all of them, Bono.<br />You know me.
4054930 4057395 That ain't the kind of laughing and joking<br />I'm talking about.
4058412 4059925 How you doing, Mr. Bono?
4059926 4062114 Get that saw from Bono and cut some wood.
4062115 4064343 He talking about the wood's too hard to cut.
4064344 4067541 Stand back there, Jim, and let that young boy<br />show you how it's done.
4067542 4069300 He's sure welcome to it.
4073769 4075596 Whew- e- e! Look at that.
4075597 4078572 Big old strong boy. Look like Joe Louis.
4079309 4080805 Hell, must be getting old the way
4080806 4083039 I'm watching that boy whip through that wood.
4083040 4085659 I don't see why Mama want a fence<br />around the yard noways.
4085660 4088404 Damn if I know either. What the hell<br />she keeping out with it?
4088405 4090494 She ain't got nothing nobody want.
4091874 4094189 Some people build fences to keep people out
4094190 4097009 and other people build fences to keep people in.
4097010 4100056 Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.
4100479 4103238 Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me<br />my wife loves me.
4103599 4106879 Cory, go on in and see if you<br />can find that other saw.
4106880 4108322 Where's it at?
4108828 4111398 I said find it! Look for it till you find it!
4114557 4117147 What's that supposed to mean? Wanna keep us in?
4132104 4133823 Troy...
4134365 4137919 I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.
4137920 4141284 You and Rose both. I done know<br />both of you all for a long time.
4141786 4144180 I remember when you met Rose.
4144181 4147396 When you was hitting them baseballs out the park.
4147397 4149889 A lot of them old gals was after you then.
4149890 4151693 You had the pick of the litter.
4151694 4156311 When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.
4156624 4159866 That was the first time I knew<br />you had any sense.
4160349 4163541 I said. My man Troy knows what he's doing
4163542 4166530 I'm gonna follow this nigger,<br />he might take me somewhere.
4166531 4168670 I been following you too.
4168671 4172889 I done learned a whole heap of things<br />about life watching you.
4173918 4176999 I done learned how to tell where the shit lies.
4177342 4179853 How to tell it from the alfalfa.
4180231 4182528 You done learned me a lot of things.
4182529 4185969 You showed me how to not make the<br />same mistakes,
4185970 4190393 to take life as it comes along and<br />keep putting one foot in front of the other.
4191052 4193897 - Rose a good woman, Troy.<br />- I know she a good woman.
4193898 4197103 I been married to her for eighteen years.<br />What you got on your mind, Bono?
4197104 4200541 I just say she a good woman. Just like I say anything.<br />I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.
4200542 4203121 You just say she a good woman and<br />leave it hanging out there like that?
4203122 4204512 Why you telling me she a good woman?
4204513 4207514 She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.
4207515 4209902 You saying I don't measure up.<br />That's what you trying to say.
4209903 4211750 I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.
4211751 4213055 I know what you trying to say.
4213056 4215394 I know what Rose means to you, Troy.
4215395 4218529 I'm just trying to say I don't want<br />to see you mess up.
4220209 4221582 Yeah,
4224869 4228221 I appreciate that, Bono.
4229781 4233270 If you was messing around on Lucille<br />I'd be telling you the same thing.
4233658 4235529 Well, that's all I got to say.
4236239 4238539 I just say that because I love you both.
4240720 4242399 Hell,
4242400 4245363 you know me. I wasn't out there looking for nothing.
4245364 4248151 You can't find a better woman than Rose.<br />I know that.
4248152 4250295 But seems like this woman
4250296 4252562 just stuck on to me where I can't shake her loose.
4252563 4256118 I done wrestled with it, tried to throw her off me<br />but she just stuck on tighter.
4256615 4258800 Now she's stuck on for good.
4258801 4261932 You's in control that's what you tell me<br />all the time.
4261933 4263722 You responsible for what you do.
4263723 4266029 I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.<br />As long as it sets right
4266030 4268014 in my heart, then I'm okay.
4268015 4271084 'Cause that's all I listen to. It'll tell<br />me right from wrong every time.
4271085 4274249 And I ain't talking about doing Rose no bad turn.<br />I love Rose.
4274483 4276133 She done carried me a long ways
4276134 4277731 and I love and respect her for that.
4277732 4280448 I know you do. That's why I don't want<br />to see you hurt her.
4280967 4284048 But what you gonna do when she find out?
4284049 4286152 What you got then?
4286153 4289559 If you try and juggle both of them,<br />sooner or later you gonna drop one of them.
4289560 4292112 - That's common sense.<br />- Yeah, I hear what you saying, Bono.
4293078 4295252 I been trying to figure a way to work it out.
4295253 4297225 Work it out right, Troy.
4297226 4300306 I ain't trying be getting all up between<br />you and Rose's business
4300307 4302564 but work it so it come out right.
4302565 4304797 Aw hell, I get all up between you and Lucille's<br />business.
4304798 4308072 When you gonna buy that woman that refrigerator<br />she been wanting?
4308073 4310983 Don't tell me you ain't got no money now.<br />I know who your banker is.
4310984 4314642 Mellon don't need that money bad as Lucille want<br />that refrigerator. I know that.
4314643 4316060 - Tell you what I'll do<br />- What?
4316061 4318449 when you finish building this fence for Rose
4318450 4319873 I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.
4319874 4322248 You done stuck your foot in your mouth now!
4323578 4326784 - Hey, nigger where you going?<br />- I'm going home.
4326785 4328744 I know you don't expect me to help you now.
4328745 4330554 I'm protecting my money.
4330555 4333737 I wanna see you put up that fence<br />by yourself.
4333738 4335214 That's what I want to see.
4335215 4337612 You'll be here another six months without me.
4337613 4338968 Nigger, you ain't right
4338969 4340734 When it comes to my money
4340735 4343958 I'm right as fireworks on the Fourth of July.
4343959 4345576 We gonna see.
4345577 4347556 You better get out your bankbook.
4398778 4401008 What they say down there?<br />What's happening with Gabe?
4401009 4404641 I went down there and got him out.<br />Cost me fifty dollars.
4404642 4406067 Say he was disturbing the peace.
4406068 4408440 Judge set up a hearing for him in three weeks.
4408441 4411293 Say to show cause why he shouldn't be recommitted.
4411294 4412992 Well, what's you say?<br />What'd you tell the judge?
4412993 4415087 I told him, I'd take care him.
4415088 4416805 It didn't make no sense to recommit the man.
4416806 4420668 He stuck out his big greasy palm, and told me<br />to give him fifty dollars and take him on home.
4420669 4422798 Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?
4422799 4425019 He's gone on about his business.<br />He don't need nobody to hold his hand.
4425020 4426459 Well, I don't know. Seem like that would be<br />the best place for him
4426460 4428311 if they did put him into the hospital.
4428312 4430878 I know what you're gonna say.<br />But that's what I think would be best.
4430879 4432713 The man done had his life ruined fighting for what?
4432714 4434024 And they wanna take and lock him up.
4434025 4435996 Let him be free. He don't bother nobody.
4435997 4440226 Well, everybody got their own way of<br />looking at it I guess.
4440227 4441615 Come on and get your lunch.
4441616 4444613 I got a bowl of lima beans and some cornbread<br />in the oven. Come on get something to eat.
4444614 4446073 Ain't no sense you fretting over Gabe.
4446074 4449002 - Rose, I got something to tell you.<br />- Well, wait till I put the food on the table.
4449003 4450396 Rose...
4450882 4454369 I don't know how to tell you this.
4457628 4459542 I can't explain it none.
4459543 4462851 It sort of grows on you<br />till it gets out of hand.
4464016 4468789 It starts out like a little bush and the next thing<br />you know it's a whole forest.
4468790 4471288 - Troy, what is you talking about?<br />- I'm talking, woman, let me talk.
4471289 4473710 I'm trying to tell you
4473711 4475627 Trying to find a way to tell you.
4481145 4483110 I'm gonna be a daddy.
4485623 4487951 I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.
4492561 4495350 Troy, you're not telling me this?<br />You're gonna be what?
4495351 4499263 - You gonna be somebody's daddy, telling your wife?<br />- Rose...Now...
4499264 4501438 Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose.
4501439 4504202 I have to wait eighteen years to hear<br />something like this.
4504203 4505625 Hey, Rose.
4507347 4509565 I got a flower for you.
4512135 4515849 That's a rose. Same rose like you is.
4521074 4522576 Thanks, Gabe.
4522577 4523996 Troy, you ain't mad at me is you?
4523997 4525873 Them bad mens come and put me away.
4525874 4527980 - You ain't mad at me is you?<br />- Naw, Gabe, I ain't mad at you.
4527981 4529883 Eighteen years and you wanna come with this.
4529884 4532637 See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.
4535374 4538872 - Rose, it's just...<br />- Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no way of explaining that.
4538873 4542003 Fellow that give me this quarter had<br />a whole mess of them.
4542004 4544433 I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stop shining.
4544434 4548202 Gabe, go on up front now. I got some watermelon<br />in the Frigidaire. I'll get you a piece.
4548203 4550897 Say, Rose, you know I was chasing hellhounds
4550898 4553860 and them bad mens come and get me<br />and take me away.
4553861 4556283 Troy helped me. He come down there and told them
4556284 4559302 they better let me go before he beat<br />them up.
4559303 4561784 - Yeah, he did!<br />- You go on up front now, Gabe.
4561785 4564489 I'll get you a piece of watermelon.<br />Them bad mens is gone now.
4564490 4569032 Okay, Rose gonna bring me some watermelon.<br />The kind with the stripes on it.
4574461 4576180 Why, Troy?
4577909 4579341 Why?
4579342 4581841 After all these years,
4582680 4584920 to come dragging this in to me now.
4584921 4586813 It don't make no sense at your age.
4587630 4591579 I could have expected this ten or<br />fifteen years ago, but not now.
4591580 4593860 Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.
4597865 4600968 I done tried to be everything a wife should be.
4602742 4606182 Everything a wife could be.<br />Been married eighteen years
4606183 4610089 and I got to live to see the day you tell me<br />you been seeing another woman
4610090 4612670 and done fathered a child by her.
4625533 4629059 And you know I ain't never wanted<br />no half- nothing in my family.
4632211 4635757 My whole family is half.<br />Everybody got different fathers and mothers
4635758 4638001 my two sisters and my brother.
4638002 4640868 Can't hardly tell who's who. Can't never sit down<br />and talk about Papa and Mama.
4640869 4643333 It's your papa and your mama<br />and my papa and my mama
4643334 4646271 I ain't never wanted that for none of my children.
4646272 4648702 And now you wanna drag your behind in here<br />and tell me something like this.
4648703 4650805 Stop it now. You ought to know.<br />It's time for you to know.
4650806 4653016 Well, I don't want to know, goddamn it!
4672289 4673625 Rose.
4676452 4679309 I just can't make it go away. It's done now.
4679928 4684333 I can't wish the circumstance of the thing away.
4684334 4686242 And you don't want to either.
4686711 4688844 Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.
4688845 4692610 Maybe that's what you want?<br />Well, you can't wish us away.
4692611 4695067 I've got eighteen years of my life invested in you.
4695068 4696745 You ought to have stayed upstairs in my bed<br />where you belong.
4696746 4699154 Rose, now listen to me, we can get a<br />handle on this thing.
4699490 4701548 We can talk this out, come to an understanding.
4701549 4702887 All of a sudden it's "we".
4702888 4705856 Where was "we" at when you was down there<br />rolling around with some godforsaken woman?
4705857 4708857 "We" should have come to an understanding before<br />you started making a damn fool of yourself.
4708858 4711360 You're a day late and a dollar short<br />when it comes to an understanding with me.
4711361 4713502 Rose, is just that...
4714811 4717202 She gives me a different idea
4717687 4721138 a different understanding about myself.
4721139 4722809 I can step out of this house
4722810 4725440 and get away from the pressures and problems
4725441 4729062 be a different man. I ain't got to wonder<br />how I'm get the roof fixed or gonna pay the bills.
4729063 4731115 I can just...
4732674 4735644 ... be a part of myself that I ain't never been before.
4736704 4738839 What I want to know is:
4741106 4743063 What I want to know...
4743673 4746451 is do you plan to continue seeing her.
4746768 4748814 That's all you can say to me.
4749827 4753552 I can sit up in her house and laugh.<br />Do you understand what I'm saying.
4754056 4757249 I can laugh out loud and it feels good.
4757250 4760695 It reaches all the way down to the bottom of my shoes.<br />Rose...
4762885 4765179 I can't give that up.
4771652 4774281 Maybe you ought to go on and<br />stay down there with her
4774282 4775841 if she a better woman than me.
4775842 4778955 It ain't about nobody being a better woman or<br />nothing. Rose, you ain't to blame.
4778956 4781091 A man couldn't ask a better wife than you've been.
4781092 4782936 And I'm responsible for it.
4782937 4784430 I done locked myself into a pattern
4784431 4786788 trying to take care of you all<br />that I forgot about myself.
4786789 4789695 What the hell was I there for? That was my job,<br />not somebody else's.
4789696 4792845 Rose, listen to me, I done tried all my life<br />to live decent
4792846 4796321 to live a clean hard useful life.
4796322 4799120 I tried to be a good husband to you.<br />In every way I knew how.
4799597 4801646 Maybe I come into the world backwards,<br />I don't know.
4801647 4804795 But. You born with two strikes on you<br />before you come to the plate.
4804796 4809044 You got to guard it closely always looking<br />for the curveball on the inside corner.
4809045 4812280 You can't afford a call strike.<br />You can't afford to let none get past you.
4812281 4814354 If you going down, you going down swinging.
4814355 4817227 Everything lined up against you.
4818327 4820023 What you gonna do.
4821496 4823055 I fooled them, Rose.
4823056 4824699 I bunted.
4824700 4828090 When I found you and Cory and a halfway decent job
4828091 4830091 I was safe. Couldn't nothing touch me.
4831007 4834045 I wasn't gonna strike out no more.<br />I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.
4834046 4836527 I wasn't gonna lay in the streets<br />with a bottle of wine.
4836528 4839062 I was safe. I had me a family.
4839063 4840971 A job...
4841776 4844447 I wasn't gonna get that last strike.
4846214 4849150 I was standing on the first base.
4849151 4850867 waiting for one of them boys to knock me in
4850868 4853139 - and bring me home...<br />- You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
4853140 4854763 Then when I saw that gal, she firmed up my backbone.
4854764 4857861 And I got to thinking that if I tried<br />maybe I could steal second.
4857862 4861778 - Do you understand what I'm saying?<br />- You should have held me tight. You should have grabbed me and held on.
4861779 4864886 I stood on first base for eighteen years and<br />I thought well, goddamn it, go on for it!
4864887 4867367 We're not talking about baseball!
4867719 4871299 We're talking about you going off to lay in bed with another<br />woman and then bring it home to me. That's what we're talking about.
4871300 4874849 - We ain't talking about no baseball.<br />- Rose, you're not listening to me.
4874850 4877905 I'm trying to explain it to you in<br />the best way I know how.
4878777 4880814 It's not easy for me to admit
4880815 4883786 that I been standing in the same place<br />for eighteen years.
4883787 4885791 I been standing with you!
4886352 4888506 I been right here with you, Troy.
4888507 4890428 I got a life too.
4890429 4894491 I gave eighteen years of my life<br />to stand in the same spot as you.
4894858 4897110 Don't you think I ever wanted other things?
4897111 4898969 Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?
4898970 4901181 What about my life? What about me?
4901182 4904522 Don't you think it ever crossed my mind<br />to want to know other men?
4904523 4907113 That I wanted to lay up somewhere
4907114 4908873 and forget about my responsibilities?
4908874 4910546 That I wanted someone to make me laugh
4910547 4912533 so I could feel good?
4912534 4914891 You not the only one who's got wants and needs.
4914892 4916594 But I held on to you, Troy.
4916595 4919511 I took all my feelings, my wants
4919512 4923172 and needs, my dreams and I buried them inside you.
4923173 4925505 I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.
4925506 4928486 I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom.
4928487 4930196 And it didn't take me no eighteen years to realize
4930197 4934195 the soil was hard and rocky<br />and it wasn't never gonna bloom.
4934196 4936085 But I held on to you, Troy.
4936086 4937656 I held you tighter.
4937657 4939231 You was my husband.
4939232 4942405 I owed you everything I had.
4942406 4944741 Every part of me I could find to give you.
4944742 4948460 And upstairs in that room with the darkness<br />falling in on me
4948461 4953445 I gave everything I had to try<br />and erase the doubt that
4953446 4956139 you wasn't the finest man in the world,
4956140 4958631 and wherever you was going,<br />I was gonna be there with you.
4958632 4960862 'Cause you was my husband.
4962275 4966056 'Cause that's the only way I was gonna survive<br />as your wife.
4966687 4970797 You always talking about what you give<br />and what you don't have to give.
4971286 4973200 But you take too. Troy.
4973201 4975826 You take and don't even know nobody's giving!
4975827 4977305 - You say I take and don't give!<br />- Troy! You're hurting me!
4977306 4979608 - You say I take and don't give.<br />- Troy, you're hurting my arm! Let go.
4979609 4981488 I done give you everything I got. Don't you tell that lie on me.<br />- Troy!
4981489 4984509 - Don't you tell that lie on me!<br />- Troy, get off me!
4985086 4986536 Troy! Troy!
4986537 4988149 All right.
4988887 4990580 That's strike two.
4991210 4993452 You stay away from around me, boy.
4994092 4995900 Don't you strike out.
4996901 4999360 You living with a full count.
5002649 5004617 DON'T YOU STRIKE OUT!
5147008 5150495 MOTHER
5205040 5207057 Troy, I want to talk to you.
5209365 5210979 All of a sudden?
5213264 5216107 After all this time, you want to talk to me?
5217461 5220299 You ain't wanted to talk to me for months.<br />You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.
5220300 5222014 You ain't wanted no part of me then.
5222500 5224334 What you wanna talk to me about now?
5227548 5230970 - Tomorrow's Friday.<br />- I know what day tomorrow is.
5230971 5232525 You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?
5232526 5234620 My whole life I ain't done nothing<br />but look to see Friday coming
5234621 5235952 and you got to tell me it's Friday.
5235953 5237771 I want to know if you're coming home.
5237772 5241509 I always come home, Rose. You know that.<br />There ain't never been a night I ain't come home.
5241510 5243617 That ain't what I mean and you know it.
5243618 5246287 I want to know if you're coming straight home<br />after work.
5246971 5249401 I figure I'd cash my check,
5249402 5251683 hang out at Taylors' with the boys,<br />maybe play a game of checkers
5251684 5254065 Troy, I can't live like this. I won't live like this.
5254066 5255935 You livin' on borrowed time with me.
5255936 5257703 It's been going on six months now<br />you ain't been coming home.
5257704 5260057 I come home every night. Every night of the year.
5260058 5262411 That's 365 days.
5263733 5266494 I want you to come home tomorrow after work.
5271209 5274128 Rose, I don't mess up my pay. You know that.
5275169 5277355 I take my pay and I give it to you.
5277356 5279789 I don't have no money but what you give me back.
5280472 5283835 I just want to have a little time to myself,
5283836 5285198 a little time to enjoy life.
5285199 5287128 What about me? When's my time to enjoy life.
5287129 5289291 I don't know what to tell you, Rose.<br />I'm doing the best I can.
5289292 5290757 You ain't been coming home from work but time enough
5290758 5293690 to change your clothes and run out and<br />you wanna call that the best you can do?
5295088 5298511 I'm going over to the hospital to see Alberta.
5299380 5303745 She went into the hospital this afternoon.<br />Look like she might have the baby early.
5305482 5307408 I won't be gone long.
5314147 5316671 Well, you ought to know. They went over to<br />Miss Pearl's and got Gabe today.
5316672 5318843 She said you told them to go ahead and lock him up.
5320474 5323732 I ain't said no such thing. Whoever told you<br />that is telling a lie.
5324424 5326633 Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big fat lie.
5326634 5328460 She ain't had to tell me. I read it on the papers.
5328461 5330684 - What it say, huh?<br />- It said you told them to take him.
5330685 5334369 Then they screwed that up, just like they screw up everything.<br />I ain't worried about what they got on the paper.
5334370 5336058 Say the government send part of his check
5336059 5337767 to the hospital and the other part to you.
5337768 5340207 I ain't got nothing to do with that if that's the way it works.<br />I ain't made up the rules about
5340208 5341883 You did Gabe just like you did Cory.
5341884 5344806 You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory but<br />you signed for Gabe. You signed that paper.
5344807 5346980 I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman!
5346981 5348602 The only thing I signed was the release form.
5348603 5351051 Hell, I can't read, I don't know what<br />they had on that paper!
5351052 5352783 I ain't signed nothing about sending Gabe away.
5352784 5355342 I said send him to the hospital<br />you said let him go free
5355343 5357984 then you went down there and signed him<br />to the hospital for half his money.
5357985 5360277 You went back on yourself, Troy.<br />You gonna have to answer for that.
5360278 5362001 you just been over there talking to Miss Pearl.
5362002 5364462 She done got mad 'cause she ain't getting<br />Gabe's rent money. That's all it is.
5364463 5367053 - Troy, I seen where you signed the paper.<br />- You ain't seen nothing I signed.
5367054 5369781 What she doing got papers on my brother anyway?
5371000 5375135 Miss Pearl doing nothing but telling a big fat lie.<br />And I'm gonna tell her about it too!
5381332 5383542 You ain't seen nothing I signed!
5384545 5385908 Say...
5387597 5389946 you ain't seen nothing I signed!
5506606 5508165 Troy.
5510418 5512004 Troy...
5517153 5520179 that was the hospital. Alberta had the baby.
5521210 5524173 What she have? What is it?
5525218 5526901 It's a girl.
5534003 5536491 I better get on down to the hospital to see her.
5538210 5539721 Troy...
5539722 5541970 Rose I got to go see her now. That's only right
5547283 5548859 what's the matter
5548860 5550630 the baby's all right, ain't it?
5553711 5556729 Alberta died having the baby.
5557907 5560293 Died, you say she's dead?
5563266 5565125 Alberta is dead?
5565126 5567847 They said they done all they could.
5569482 5571605 They couldn't do nothing for her.
5601722 5605153 The baby? How's the baby?
5606484 5608714 They say it's healthy.
5611010 5612641 I wonder who's gonna bury her.
5612642 5615543 She had family, Rose. She wasn't living in the<br />world by herself.
5615544 5617850 I know she wasn't living in the world by herself.
5617851 5620709 - Next thing you gonna want to know if she had any insurance.<br />- Troy, you ain't got to talk like that.
5620710 5622950 That's the first thing that jumped out your mouth.<br />"Who's gonna bury her?"
5622951 5624537 Like I'm fixing to take on that task for myself.
5624538 5626511 I am your wife. Don't push me away.
5626512 5629058 I ain't pushing nobody away.
5629059 5631059 Just give me some space,<br />Just give me some room to breathe!
5661701 5663629 All right, Mr. Death.
5668500 5670765 I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.
5671937 5674082 I'm gonna take
5674426 5678239 and build me a fence around this yard. See?
5680240 5683472 I'm gonna build me a fence around<br />what belongs to me.
5683473 5686954 And then I want you to stay on the other side.
5686955 5688815 You stay over there until you're ready for me.
5688816 5690116 Then you come on.
5692243 5696082 Bring your army. Bring your sickle.<br />Bring your wrestling clothes.
5696083 5698699 I ain't gonna fall down on my vigilance this time.
5698700 5700135 You ain't gonna...
5702826 5705182 You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.
5707838 5709389 When you ready for me
5709390 5711982 when the top of your list say Troy Maxson
5711983 5714005 You come up and knock on the front door.

5719982 5722277 Man to man.

5733762 5736361 Then come and knock on the front door,
5736362 5740199 at any time you want.

6227606 6230749 What you stop by and see me for?<br />You ain't stopped by in a month of Sundays.
6231737 6233884 Hell, I must owe you money or something.

6265769 6267292 It ain't the same, Bono.
6267293 6269134 It ain't like working the back of the truck.
6270338 6274200 feel like you working by yourself,<br />nobody to talk to
6275489 6277592 I'm thinking about retiring.

6473128 6476400 And if you wanna go in my house and<br />I'm sitting on the steps
6476401 6478080 you say excuse me. Like your mama taught you.

6484573 6486226 I ain't scared of you.
6486227 6487893 I ain't asked if you was scared of me.
6487894 6490712 I asked you if you was fixing to walk over top of me<br />in my own house?
6490713 6494242 That's the question. You ain't gonna say excuse me?<br />You just gonna walk over top of me?
6494243 6496561 - If you wanna put it like that.<br />- How else am I gonna put it?
6496562 6498633 I was walking by you to go into the house
6498634 6501110 'cause you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself.<br />You can put it like that.
6501111 6502783 Without saying excuse me?
6507337 6509086 I asked you a question.
6509087 6510687 Without saying excuse me?
6510688 6513263 I ain't got to say excuse me to you.<br />You don't count around here no more.
6516177 6518253 Oh, I see, I don't count around here no more.
6518254 6519797 You ain't got to say excuse me to your daddy.

6524974 6528234 Around here in his own house and yard<br />that he done paid for
6528235 6529605 with the sweat of his brow.

6533068 6534576 Would you gonna take over.
6536334 6539399 You gonna take over my house.<br />You gonna wear my pants.
6539400 6541672 You gonna go in there and stretch out on my bed.
6542894 6544910 You ain't got to say excuse me
6544911 6547665 Because your daddy don't count around here no more.<br />Is that right?
6547666 6549056 That's right.
6549057 6551756 You always talking this dumb stuff.<br />Now, why don't you just get out my way.
6551757 6553570 I guess you got someplace to sleep,
6554342 6556116 something to put in your belly.
6556853 6558379 You got that, huh?
6560467 6562084 'Cause that's what you need.
6562711 6564065 You got that?
6565263 6567800 You don't know what I got.<br />You ain't got to worry about what I got.
6567801 6569291 You right!
6569646 6571745 You one hundred percent right!
6571746 6575386 I done spent the last seventeen years<br />worrying about what you got.

6577639 6579102 I'll tell you what to do.
6580195 6583066 You grown, we done established that.
6583584 6586419 You a man. Now, let's see you act like one.
6586420 6588443 Turn your behind around and walk out this yard.
6588444 6591597 And when you get out there in the alley<br />you can forget about this house. See?
6591598 6593011 'Cause this is my house.
6593012 6595796 You go on and be a man and get your own house.
6595797 6597992 You can forget about this. 'Cause this is mine.
6597993 6600736 You go on and get yours,<br />'cause I'm through with doing for you.
6600737 6602660 You talking about what you did for me,<br />what'd you ever give me?

6611539 6614698 You ain't never done nothing but hold me back.<br />Afraid I was gonna be better than you.
6615922 6618359 All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.
6619282 6621441 I used to tremble every time you called my name.
6621442 6623447 Every time I heard your footsteps in the house.
6624047 6626378 Wondering all the time,<br />what's Papa gonna say if I do this?
6626379 6629393 What's he gonna say if I do that?<br />What's Papa gonna say if I turn on the radio?
6629394 6631093 And Mama, too she tries but she's scared of you.
6631094 6633904 - You leave your mama out of this. Your mama ain't got nothing...<br />- I don't know how she stand you after what you did to her.
6633905 6636492 - I told you to leave your mama out of this!<br />- What you gonna do

7091263 7093503 They got me down the workhouse.
7094088 7097521 I thought I was being slick cashing other people's checks.
7098440 7100090 How much time you doing?
7100944 7102883 They give me three years.
7103604 7106751 I got that beat now.<br />I ain't got but nine more months.

7119537 7122000 You got to take the crookeds with the straights.
7122001 7123684 That's what Papa used to say.
7125003 7127394 He used to say that when he struck out.
7128631 7131300 I seen him strike out three times in a row
7131301 7134575 and the next time up he hit the ball over the grandstand.
7135374 7137672 Right out there in Homestead Field.
7138772 7141048 He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats
7141049 7142985 he wanted to hit it over everything!
7144429 7146257 After the game,
7147407 7152102 he had two hundred people standing around<br />waiting to shake his hand.
7154871 7158109 You got to take the crookeds with the straights.
7161659 7163647 Yeah, Papa was something else.
7164506 7166295 You still playing?

7233000 7234718 That's what Papa call it.
7234719 7236452 "Cory's room."
7238168 7240363 It got your football in the closet.

7243544 7246070 Mama, can't I wear these?<br />Them other one hurt my feet.
7246071 7247856 Well, they just gonna have to hurt<br />your feet for a while.
7247857 7250525 You ain't said they hurt your feet when<br />you went down to the store and got them.
7250526 7252658 They didn't hurt then. My feet done got bigger.
7252659 7254220 Don't you give me no back talk now.
7254221 7256588 You get up there and get them shoes on.
7324416 7326600 Ain't too much changed.
7327507 7330215 He still got that rag tied to that tree.
7333385 7335584 He was out here swinging that bat.
7336934 7339958 I was just get ready to go back in the house.
7340992 7344132 He swung that bat and then he just fell over.
7346276 7350397 Seem like when he swung it, he stood there<br />with this grin on his face
7356099 7358125 and then he just fell...
7360575 7364422 They carried him on down to the hospital<br />but I knew there wasn't no need
7366965 7369682 - why don't you come on in the house.<br />- Mama, I got something to tell you.
7371908 7374566 I don't know how to tell you this<br />but I've got to tell you.
7375159 7377174 I'm not going to Papa's funeral.
7379506 7381151 Boy...
7381152 7383275 hush your mouth.
7383276 7385908 That's your daddy you talking about.
7385909 7387763 I don't want hear that kind of talk this morning.
7387764 7389483 I done raised you to come to this?
7389484 7392930 You standing there all healthy and grown talking<br />about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?
7392931 7394921 - Mama, listen...<br />- I don't want to hear it, Cory.
7394922 7396565 You just get that thought out of your head.
7396566 7399121 I've got to say no to him. One time in my life<br />I've got to say no.
7399122 7400784 Don't nobody have to listen to nothing like that.
7400785 7402567 I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye,
7402568 7405002 but I ain't gotta listen to that kind of talk<br />this morning.
7405793 7408589 Disrespecting your daddy<br />ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.
7408590 7410446 You got to find a way to come to that on your own.
7410447 7413087 Not going to your daddy's funeral<br />ain't gonna make you a man.
7415656 7418693 The whole time I was growing up living in his house
7418694 7421630 Papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere.
7422277 7425433 It weighed on you and sunk into your flesh.
7426238 7427913 It would wrap around you and lay there until
7427914 7430580 you couldn't tell which one was you anymore.
7431064 7434625 That shadow's digging in to your flesh.
7435136 7437694 Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you.
7438185 7442158 Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson<br />staring right back at me.
7443094 7445410 Under the bed, in the closet...
7446550 7449785 I'm just saying I gotta find a way to get rid of<br />that shadow, mama.
7449786 7452888 - You just like him. You got him in you good.<br />- Don't tell me that, Mom.
7452889 7456590 - You Troy Maxson all over again.<br />- I don't wanna be Troy Maxson!
7458373 7459783 I just want to be me.
7459784 7462279 You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.
7463076 7465895 That shadow wasn't nothing but you<br />growing into yourself.
7465896 7468360 You either got to grow into it or<br />cut it down to fit you.
7468361 7470384 But that's all you got to make life with.
7470385 7474196 That's all you got to measure yourself<br />against that world out there.
7475402 7478300 Your daddy wanted you to be<br />everything he wasn't
7478301 7482846 and at the same time he wanted you to be<br />everything he was.
7483326 7486420 I don't know if he was right or wrong,<br />but I do know
7486421 7489148 he meant to do more good than<br />he meant to do harm.
7491198 7493850 Sometimes when he touched he bruised.
7494607 7497889 And sometimes when he took me in his arms he cut.
7504770 7509639 When I first met your daddy I thought,
7509640 7513194 "Here is a man I can lay down with and make a baby."
7516275 7519022 That's the first thing I thought when I seen him
7519023 7522080 I thought, "Rose Lee,
7522081 7524564 here is a man that you can open yourself up
7524565 7526829 to and be filled to bursting.
7528193 7530529 Here is a man,
7530530 7533333 that can fill all them empty spaces
7533334 7535639 you been tipping around the edges of."
7540761 7543509 When your daddy walked through the house
7544082 7545894 he was just...
7546538 7549240 ...so big,
7550820 7552616 he filled it up.
7555090 7557194 That was my first mistake.
7557767 7560483 Not to make him leave some room for me.
7560742 7562256 But...
7564728 7567611 I wanted a house that I could sing in,
7568706 7571090 and that's what your daddy gave me.
7572154 7574006 I didn't know to keep up his strength
7574007 7576325 I had to give up little pieces of mine.
7577913 7580746 I took on his life as mine
7580747 7582065 and mixed up the pieces
7582066 7584200 so that you couldn't hardly tell<br />which was which.
7587078 7590437 It was my choice, my life
7590438 7594592 and I didn't have to live it like that. But that's
7595750 7599377 what life offered me in the way of being a woman<br />and I took it.
7601229 7603507 I grabbed hold of it with both hands.
7604264 7607169 By the time Raynell came into the house
7612435 7614968 I didn't want to make my blessing off
7614969 7616527 of nobody's misfortune, but
7618254 7621430 I took on to Raynell like she was
7621431 7624799 all them babies I had wanted and never had.
7626903 7630088 Like I'd been blessed to relive a part of my life.
7632975 7636232 And if the Lord see fit to keep up my strength
7638061 7642545 I'm gonna do her exactly how your daddy did you
7645879 7648973 I'm gonna give her the best of what's in me.
7658563 7661890 Mama, Reverend Tolliver on the phone.
7680058 7681593 Hi.
7683342 7684745 Hi.
7684746 7688590 - You in the Army or the Marines?<br />- Marines.
7689655 7691810 Papa said it was the Army.
7691811 7694942 - Did you know Blue?<br />- Blue? Who's Blue?
7694943 7697366 Papa's dog what he sing about all the time.
7699675 7702521 Hear it ring! Hear it ring!
7703974 7706585 I had a dog his name was Blue
7707630 7709768 Blue was mighty true
7710460 7712885 You know Blue was a good old dog
7713986 7716613 Blue treed a possum in a hollow log
7717220 7719106 From that you know he was a good old dog.
7719107 7721708 Hear it ring! Hear it ring!
7722081 7724767 Blue treed a possum out on a limb
7724768 7727235 Blue looked at me and I looked at him
7727236 7729793 Grabbed that possum and put him in a sack
7729794 7732293 Blue stayed there till I came back
7732294 7734878 Old Blue's feets was big and round
7734879 7737378 Never allowed a possum to touch the ground.
7737379 7739989 Old Blue died and I dug his grave
7739990 7742551 I dug his grave with a silver spade
7742552 7745100 Let him down with a golden chain
7745101 7747449 And every night I call his name
7747450 7750565 Go on Blue, you good dog you, come on!
7750566 7753048 Go on Blue, you good dog you
7753049 7755621 Blue laid down and died like a man
7755622 7757985 Blue laid down and died...
7758565 7762875 Blue laid down and died like a man
7763735 7766546 Now he's treeing possums in the Promised Land.
7767330 7770085 I'm gonna tell you this to let you know
7770086 7772809 Blue's gone where the good dogs go.
7774497 7778380 Blue's gone where the good dogs go.
7781307 7783716 Cory, we're getting ready to leave now.
7788712 7790996 Go...
7791154 7793706 go upstairs and put your shoes on<br />like mama told you
7793707 7796264 so we can get ready to go to Papa's funeral.

7817031 7819576 I'm here, Rose. Hey Rose, I'm here.
