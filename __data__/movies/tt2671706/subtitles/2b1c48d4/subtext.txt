68160 71039 - BONO: <i>Troy, you ought to stop that lying.</i><br />- TROY: <i>I ain't lying.</i>
71040 72839 <i>Nigger had a watermelon this big,</i>
72840 74799 <i>talking about,<br />"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>

77680 79439 And it sitting there, big as life.
79440 81639 - BONO: What Mr. Rand say?<br />- He ain't said nothing.
81640 84520 He figure, if the nigger was too dumb<br />to know he's carrying a watermelon,
84521 86400 he wasn't going to get<br />much sense out of him.
86401 89079 Trying to hide that great, big,<br />old watermelon under his coat.
89080 91795 Afraid to let the white man<br />see him carry it home.
92040 94559 I'm like you.<br />I ain't got no time for them kinda people.
94560 96199 Now, what he look like getting mad
96200 98481 'cause he seen the man from the union<br />talking to Mr. Rand?
98506 101559 He come up to me, talking about<br />"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."
101560 103839 I told him, "Get away from me with that."
103840 106509 He walked away from me<br />calling you a troublemaker.
106680 108439 What Mr. Rand say?
108440 110199 He ain't said nothing. Told me to go down
110200 112198 to the Commissioner's office<br />next Friday. Whoa!
112360 113880 They called me down there to see them.
113905 117279 Well, as long as you got your<br />complaint filed, they can't fire you.
117280 118719 That's what one of them<br />white fellas tell me.
118720 120200 I ain't worried about them firing me.
120225 122359 What, they gonna fire me<br />'cause I asked a question?
122360 123559 That's all I did.
123560 125679 I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.
125680 126759 I asked him, "Why?"
126760 129039 "Why you got all the white men<br />driving, and the coloured lifting?"
129040 131039 Told him, "What's the matter?<br />Don't I count?"
131040 133119 "Think only white fellows<br />got sense enough to drive a truck?"
133120 135479 "Hell, that ain't no paper job.<br />Anybody can drive a truck."
135480 138120 "How come you got all the whites driving<br />and the coloured lifting?"
138145 140064 (TRASH CLATTERING)
140399 141799 He told me, "Take it to the union."
141800 143159 Well, hell, that's what I done.
143160 145399 Now they want to come up<br />with this pack of lies.
145400 147959 I told Brownie if the man<br />come and ask him any questions,
147960 149319 just tell the truth.
149320 152359 Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up<br />on you 'cause you filed a complaint on.
152360 153719 Brownie ain't got that much sense.
153720 155080 Man wasn't thinking about nothing.
155081 157121 All I want them to do<br />is change the job description,
157146 159316 give everybody a chance<br />to drive the truck. Oi!
159400 160559 (THUMPING)
160560 163434 Brownie can't see that.<br />He ain't got that much sense.

202760 204799 If you had gotten anywhere near that gal,
204800 207119 20 minutes later,<br />you'd be looking to tell somebody.
207120 210720 And the first one you gonna want to tell, that<br />you gonna want to brag to is going to be me.
210745 211839 Oh, I ain't saying that.
211840 213119 (LAUGHS)
213120 215239 I see where you be eyeing her.
215240 217719 I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.
217720 219999 Don't never let nobody tell you<br />Troy Maxson don't eye the women.
220000 221399 Hey, you been doing more than eyeing her.
221400 222679 You done bought her a drink or two.
222680 224079 Hell, yeah,<br />I bought her a drink. What that mean?
224080 225440 - I bought you one, too.<br />- (SCOFFS)
225465 227119 What that mean, 'cause I buy her a drink?
227120 228239 I'm just being polite.
228240 229680 It's all right to buy her one drink.
229705 231359 That's what you call being polite.
231360 233159 But when you want to be<br />buying two or three,
233160 234639 that's what you call eyeing her.
234640 236399 Look here. As long as you've known me,
236400 238359 you ever known me to chase after women?
238360 240759 Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.
240760 242160 You're forgetting, I knew you when.
242185 244239 I'm talking about<br />since I been married to Rose.
244240 246479 Oh... Not since you been married to Rose.
246480 248120 That's the truth, though. I can say that.
248145 249938 All right then. Case closed.

265321 266641 She just kinda showed up one day.

269920 272239 They got some big,<br />healthy women down there.
272240 274159 Grow them right up out of the ground.
274160 275799 She got a little bit of Indian in her.

282920 285039 - Woman wears some big stockings.<br />- (BOTH LAUGHING)
285040 289279 Got them crazy big legs,<br />and hips wide as the Mississippi River.
289280 290839 Legs don't mean nothing.
290840 292760 You don't do nothing<br />but push 'em out of the way.
292785 294199 But them hips,
294200 297239 - they cushion the ride.<br />- Troy, you ain't got no sense!
297240 300359 It's the truth.<br />Like you riding on Goodyears!
300360 301880 (LAUGHING)
303400 305439 What you all out here getting into?

329760 331839 And you know<br />what kind of talk I mean, too.
331840 333399 You go on in there and powder it up.
333400 334879 Troy, stop it!
334880 336319 (ALL LAUGHING)
336320 337874 Oh, woman, come here.
337920 341239 Oh! Look here, Bono.
341240 343759 When I first met this woman,
343760 345639 I got out that place.
345640 348679 (SINGING) <i>Hitch up my pony</i><br /><i>Saddle up my mare.</i>
348680 351399 <i>There's a woman out there for me somewhere</i>
351400 354319 I looked at here, looked at there,<br />saw Rose, and I latched on to her.
354320 355399 (CHUCKLES)
355400 357359 I latched on to her and I told her...
357360 358994 Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.
359080 363439 I latched on to her and told her,<br />"Baby, I don't want to marry."
363440 365159 "I just want to be your man."
365160 367719 Rose told me...<br />Tell him what you told me, RO.
367720 369599 I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,
369600 372000 then move out of the way,<br />so the marrying kind could find me.
372025 374439 That's what she told me,<br />"Nigger, you in my way."
374440 375839 "You blocking the view."
375840 377879 "Move out the way,<br />so I can find me a husband."
377880 380439 - I thought it over 2-3 days.<br />- Two-three days, nothing.
380440 381959 You was back the same night.
381960 384199 I come back, told her, "Okay, baby",
384200 386079 "but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster"
386080 387799 "and put him out there in the backyard."
387800 389319 "And when he see a stranger come,"
389320 390799 "he gonna flap his wings and crow."
390800 393081 Look here, Bono.<br />I done watched that front door by myself.
393106 395799 It was that back door I was worried about.
395800 398435 Don't talk like that!<br />Troy, you're not but telling a lie.
398560 402719 Only thing was, we first got married,<br />forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.
402720 403959 I hear you tell it.
403960 406439 Me and Lucille was staying<br />down there on Logan Street.
406440 408999 Had two rooms<br />with the outhouse in the back.
409000 410719 I ain't mind the outhouse none.
410720 413279 But when that goddamn<br />wind blew through there in the winter,
413280 415199 that's what I'm talking about! (LAUGHS)
415320 416759 To this day, I wonder why the hell
416760 419279 I ever stayed down there<br />for six long years.
419280 421040 But, see, I didn't know<br />I could do no better.
421065 421839 (TROY GRUNTS)
421840 424639 I thought only white folks<br />had inside toilets and things.
424640 427559 A lot of folks don't think they can<br />do no better than they're doing now.
427560 430759 Just something you gotta learn.<br />A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.
430760 432439 Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.<br />She got fresh food.
432440 434360 I ain't said nothing about<br />if she got fresh food.
434385 435759 I'm talking about what she charge.
435760 437719 She charges 10 cents more than the A&P.
437720 439359 A&P ain't never done nothing for me.
439360 441279 I spend my money where I'm treated right.
441280 442679 I go down to Bella, say,
442680 445280 "I need a loaf of bread,<br />I'll pay you Friday," she gives it to me.
445305 447119 What sense that make when I got money
447120 448519 to spend it somewhere else
448520 450200 and ignore the person<br />who done right by me?
450225 451319 That ain't in the Bible.
451320 452719 We ain't talking about<br />what's in the Bible.
452720 454959 What sense it make to shop there<br />when she overcharges?
454960 456559 Well, you do your shopping<br />where you want to,
456560 458159 I do my shopping<br />where people been good to me.
458160 460199 Oh, I don't think it's right for<br />her to overcharge, that's all.
460200 461479 Look here, I got to be getting on.
461480 462999 Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.
463000 464639 Where you going, nigger?<br />We ain't finished this pint.
464640 465919 Come here finish this pint.
465920 468559 Well, hell, I am,<br />if you ever turn the bottle loose.
468560 469879 (LAUGHS)
469880 474438 Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,<br />I'm glad Cory got that job down there.
474479 476199 Help him with<br />his school clothes and things.
476200 478599 Gabe done moved out,<br />things getting tight around here.
478600 479919 He got that job,
479920 481559 he can start to look out for himself.
481560 484919 Cory done got recruited<br />by a college football team.
484920 488119 I told that boy about<br />that college football stuff.
488120 490999 The white man ain't gonna<br />let him get nowhere with that football.
491000 493079 I told him<br />when he first come to me with it.
493080 495759 Now, you come telling me<br />he done got more tied up in it.
495760 499239 He ought to get recruited in how to fix<br />cars, or some way he can make a living.
499240 501719 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
501720 503799 It's just something the boys in school do.
503800 505999 They're gonna send a recruiter by<br />to talk to you. He'll tell you.
506000 508240 He ain't talking about<br />making no living playing football.
508265 509679 It's an honour to be recruited.
509680 512315 It ain't gonna get him nowhere,<br />Bono'll tell you that.
512440 515559 If he be like you in sports,<br />he gonna be all right.
515560 518159 Ain't but two men<br />ever played baseball good as you.
518160 520279 That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.
520280 522519 Them the only two men ever<br />hit more home runs than you.
522520 524919 And what it ever get me?<br />I ain't got a pot to piss in,
524920 526279 or a window to throw it out of.
526280 528119 Times have changed since<br />you were playing baseball, Troy.
528120 530239 That was before the war.<br />Times have changed a lot since then.
530240 531480 How the hell they done changed?
531481 533401 They got a lot of coloured boys<br />playing ball now.
533426 534439 Baseball and football.
534440 537559 You right about that, RO.<br />Times have changed, Troy.
537560 538999 You just come along too early.
539000 542876 There ought not never<br />have been no time called "too early."
544200 546519 Now you take that fellow...
546520 549279 What's that fellow they had playing<br />right field back then for the Yankees?
549280 551479 You remember who I'm talking about, Bono,<br />played right field for The Yankees.
551480 553239 - Selkirk?<br />- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!
553240 556639 Man's batting 269, you understand? 269!
556640 560439 What sense that make?<br />I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!
560440 563519 He's batting 269,<br />playing right field for the Yankees!
563520 565719 I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.
565720 568479 She's running around<br />with raggedy shoes on her feet.
568480 570119 I bet you<br />Selkirk's daughter ain't running around
570120 571999 with no raggedy shoes on her feet.<br />I bet you that.
572000 573919 They got a lot of<br />coloured baseball players now.
573920 575159 Jackie Robinson was the first.
575160 576719 Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.
576720 579999 I done seen 100 niggers play baseball<br />better than Jackie Robinson.
580000 582999 Hell, I seen some teams<br />Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!
583000 584600 What you talking about, Jackie Robinson?
584625 586119 Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!
586120 589040 I'm talking about if you could play ball,<br />then they ought to let you play.
589041 590321 Don't matter what Color you are.
590346 591999 Telling me I come along too early.
592000 595359 If you can play,<br />then they ought to let you play.
595360 596759 You gonna drink yourself to death.
596760 598799 You don't need to be drinking like that.
598800 601839 Oh! Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,
601840 604360 I done wrestled with him.<br />You can't tell me nothing about death.
604385 607599 Death ain't nothing<br />but a fastball on the outside corner,
607600 609559 and you know what I do with that.
609560 611519 Look here, Bono, am I lying?
611520 614439 You get one of them fastballs<br />about waist high
614440 616119 on the outside corner of the plate
616120 617919 where you can get<br />the meat of the bat on it,
617920 621239 and, good God, you could kiss it good-bye.
621240 623359 - Am I lying?<br />- No, you telling the truth.
623360 624879 I seen you do it.
624880 630079 If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth<br />of lying. That's all death is to me.
630080 632599 A fastball on the outside corner.
632600 634999 I don't know why you want to<br />get on talking about death?
635000 636399 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with talking about death.
636400 638239 That's a part of life!<br />Everybody gonna die.
638240 639599 You gonna die. I'm gonna die.
639600 641479 Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.
641480 643919 But you ain't got to talk about it.<br />I don't like talking about it.
643920 645200 Well, you the one brought it up.
645225 646839 Me and Bono talking about baseball.
646840 648880 You come telling me<br />I'm gonna drink myself to death.
648905 650239 Ain't that right, Bono?
650240 652559 Now you know I drink just<br />but one night out the week,
652560 653839 that's Friday night.
653840 655599 I drink just enough<br />to where I can handle it.
655600 657200 Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.
657201 659561 So, you ain't got to worry<br />about me drinking myself to death
659562 661200 'cause I ain't worrying about death.
661201 663759 I done seen him, done wrestled with him.
663760 665119 Look here, Bono.
665120 668359 I look up one day,<br />and Death is marching straight at me,
668360 670559 like soldiers on parade.
670560 672999 The Army of Death<br />was marching straight at me.
673000 676439 It was the middle of July, 1941.
676440 678759 And it got real cold,<br />just like it be winter.
678760 680439 And it seemed like Death, himself,
680440 682559 reached out<br />and touched me on the shoulder.
682560 685919 He touched me like I touch you now.<br />I got cold as ice.
685920 687400 Death standing there, grinning at me.
687425 689079 Troy, why don't you hush that talk.
689080 692439 I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?<br />You be wanting me?"
692440 694399 "You done sent your army<br />to be getting me?"
694400 695560 I looked him dead in the eye.
695585 696599 I wasn't fearing nothing.
696600 699474 I was ready to tangle,<br />just like I'm ready to tangle now!
699640 701599 Bible says be ever vigilant.
701600 703999 So, I don't get but so drunk.<br />I got to keep watch.
704000 705679 Troy was right down there<br />at Mercy Hospital.
705680 707119 You remember he had that pneumonia,
707120 709240 laying there with a fever,<br />talking plumb out his head.
709241 712161 And Death standing there, staring at me,<br />carrying that sickle in his hand.
712186 717839 Finally, he say, "You want to be<br />bound over for another year?"
717840 720079 (LAUGHING) Just like that. He say,
720080 723959 "You want to be bound over<br />for another year?"
723960 728079 I said, "Bound over, hell!<br />We can settle this right now."
728080 731559 He kinda fell back when I said that.<br />And all the cold went out of me.
731560 733752 I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.
733760 737279 I threw it as far as I could throw it,<br />and me and him commenced to wrestling.
737280 740879 We wrestled for... Carry the six...<br />Three days and three nights!
740880 743279 Now, I don't know<br />where I got the strength from,
743280 745200 'cause every time<br />he tried to get the best of me,
745225 749279 I reached way deep down inside myself,<br />found the strength to do him one better.
749280 752279 Every time Troy tells that story,<br />he find different ways to tell it,
752280 753960 - different things to make up.<br />- (LAUGHING)
753985 755319 I ain't making up nothing, woman.
755320 757000 I'm telling you<br />the facts of what happened.
757025 759359 I wrestled with Death<br />for three days and three nights,
759360 761995 and I'm standing here<br />to tell you about it.
764120 766239 All right. At the end of the third night,
766240 769399 we done weakened each other<br />to where we can't even hardly move.
769400 770479 Death stood up.
770480 772761 He threw on that robe,<br />had a white robe with a hood on it.
772786 773799 (BOTH LAUGHING)
773800 776159 He threw on that robe<br />and went off to look for that sickle.
776160 779919 He said, "I'll be back."<br />Just like that. "I'll be back."
779920 783119 I said, "Yeah?<br />Well, you gonna have to find me!"
783120 784436 I wasn't no fool.
784720 786199 I wasn't going looking for him.
786200 788961 I know Death ain't nothing to play with.<br />And I know he's gonna get me.
788986 791959 I know I got to join his army,<br />his camp followers.
791960 794919 But as long as I keep up my strength<br />and see him coming,
794920 798879 as long as I keep up my vigilance,<br />he gonna have to fight to get me.
798880 800355 I ain't going easy.
800560 804319 Well, look here,<br />since you got to keep up your vigilance,
804320 806319 - let me have the bottle.<br />- Oh! (LAUGHS)
806320 807839 Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.
807840 809160 I should have left out that part.
809185 810599 Troy be talking all that stuff.
810600 813079 Half the time, he don't even know<br />what he be talking about!
813080 815680 - Yeah, Bono know me better than that.<br />- That's right, I know you.
815705 818399 I know you got some<br />Uncle Remus in your blood.
818400 820759 You got more stories<br />than the devil got sinners.
820760 823439 Oh, hell, I done seen him, too.<br />Done talked to the devil.

840120 841839 Troy, leave your boy alone.<br />He come by to see you
841840 843440 and you want to start all that nonsense.

878200 880519 - Yeah, I done seen him.<br />- ROSE: He ain't seen no devil.
880520 882840 I told him that man<br />ain't had nothing to do with the devil.
882841 885161 Anything he can't understand,<br />he want to call it the devil.
885186 888159 Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's<br />to get some furniture.
888160 891039 You got three rooms for $298.<br />That what it say on the radio.

897560 899879 I'm working every day,<br />can't get no credit.
899880 901119 What to do?
901120 903040 I got an empty house<br />with some raggedy furniture.
903065 904119 Cory ain't got no bed.
904120 906319 He's sleeping on a pile of rags<br />on the floor.
906320 908439 Working every day, can't get no credit.
908440 911998 I come back here, Rose'll tell you, madder<br />than hell, trying to figure out what to do.
912120 913319 Come a knock on the door.

915480 917679 I open the door. Devil standing there.
917680 918799 Bigger than life.
918800 920759 White fella,<br />got on good clothes and everything.
920760 921999 Standing there<br />with a clipboard in his hand.
922000 923399 Now, I ain't got to say nothing.
923400 924919 First words come out of his mouth,
924920 927839 "I understand you need some furniture<br />and can't get no credit."
927840 931399 I liked to fell over. He said,<br />"I'll give you all the credit you want,"
931400 933479 "but you gonna have to pay<br />the interest on it."
933480 936559 Now, I told him, he give me them three<br />rooms, he can charge whatever he want.
936560 938279 Next day, a truck pull up here,
938280 940039 two men unload them three rooms.
940040 942319 Man what drove the truck give me a book.
942320 945879 Said first of the month,<br />send $10 to the address in the book,
945880 947039 everything will be fine.
947040 948599 Said if you miss a payment,
948600 951359 the devil was coming back,<br />and there'll be hell to pay.
951360 952959 That was 15 years ago.
952960 956599 To this day, first day of every month,<br />I send my $10,
956600 958120 just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.
958145 959519 Troy lying.

963081 965079 And I ain't sold my soul<br />or nothing like that.
965080 967879 No, I wouldn't have truck with the<br />devil over nothing like that.
967880 971559 But I got my furniture.<br />And I send my $10, just like clockwork.
971560 974519 How long you say<br />you been paying this $10 a month?

982720 984120 Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.
984145 986599 Troy lying.<br />We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.
986600 988399 He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.
988400 990799 Hell, woman,<br />Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

993665 994559 I'll tell you this.
994560 996399 It don't matter to me if it was the devil.
996400 997839 It don't matter if the devil give credit.
997840 999839 - Somebody got to give it.<br />- It ought to matter.
999840 1002199 You walking around here saying<br />you gonna make truck with the devil,
1002200 1003719 God's the one<br />you're gonna have to answer to.

1005320 1007359 Yeah, well, look here, Pop,<br />let me have that $10.

1010225 1011279 Bono, what did I tell you?
1011280 1012919 Only time I see this nigger<br />is when he want something.

1068880 1072559 Gabe done moved out, giving his money over<br />there to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.
1072560 1073839 Things done got tight around here.

1325760 1326999 - Poor folks can't get nothing.<br />- (GROANS)
1327000 1328399 Them numbers don't know nobody.
1328400 1330679 I don't know why you fool with 'em,<br />you and Lyons both.
1330680 1332239 Oh, it's something to do.
1332240 1334599 You ain't doing nothing<br />but throwing your money away.
1334600 1336239 Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.
1336240 1338000 I just play a nickel here<br />and a nickel there.
1338001 1339600 That's two nickels you done threw away.
1339601 1342239 Nah, I hit sometimes.<br />That makes up for it.
1342240 1343839 Always comes in handy when I do hit.
1343840 1345200 I don't hear you complaining then.
1345201 1347160 I ain't complaining now.<br />I just say it's foolish,
1347161 1350279 trying to guess out of 600 ways<br />which way the number gonna come.
1350280 1352039 If I had all the money these niggers...
1355520 1359519 You Negroes throw away<br />on numbers in one week,
1359520 1362439 just one week, I'd be a rich man.
1362440 1365720 You wishing and calling it foolish ain't<br />gonna stop folks from playing the numbers.
1365745 1367799 That's one thing for sure.
1367800 1371039 Besides, some good things<br />come from playing numbers.
1371040 1374079 Look where Pope done bought him<br />that restaurant off of numbers.
1374080 1376599 - I can't stand niggers like that.<br />- (LAUGHS)
1376600 1378799 Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.
1378800 1381599 He running around with his shoes<br />all run-over,
1381600 1383679 bumming money for cigarettes.
1383680 1386679 All right.<br />Got lucky there, hit the numbers...
1386680 1388119 (SOFTLY) Troy, I know all about it.
1388120 1389840 TROY: Had good sense.<br />I'll say that for him.
1389841 1391280 Man ain't throw his money away.
1391281 1394879 I done see niggers go through<br />$2,000 in four days.
1394880 1397479 Man built him that restaurant down there.
1397480 1399079 Fix it up real nice, too.
1399080 1401039 Then he won't let nobody come in it.
1401040 1403439 Negro go in there,<br />can't get no kind of service.
1403440 1406839 Seen a white fella go in there,<br />he orders a bowl of stew.
1406840 1409159 Pope pick all the meat<br />out of the pot for him.
1409160 1411199 Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!
1411200 1414799 Negro go in there behind him, he ain't got<br />nothing but the potatoes and the carrots.
1414800 1416999 Talking about what numbers do for people.
1417000 1418400 You picked the wrong example there.
1418425 1420519 Ain't done nothing<br />but made a worse fool out of him
1420520 1422473 than he already was before.
1423080 1424159 (GRUNTS)
1424160 1425519 Troy.
1425520 1428952 You ought to stop worrying about<br />what happened at work yesterday.
1431040 1432560 I ain't worried.
1433920 1436119 Just called me down there,<br />the Commissioner's office,
1436120 1438839 everybody's worried about them firing me.
1438840 1441799 I ain't worrying about them firing me.
1441800 1444119 You ain't got to worry about that.
1444120 1446471 Where's Cory? Cory in the house?
1449680 1451919 - Cory!<br />- He gone out.
1451920 1453759 Out, huh? Yeah, he going out
1453760 1456719 'cause he know<br />I want him to work on this fence.
1456720 1458719 I know how he is.<br />That boy is scared of working.
1458720 1460079 He ain't done a lick of work in his life.
1460080 1461639 He had to go to football practice.
1461640 1463719 Coach wanted them<br />to get in a little extra practice
1463720 1465079 before the season start.
1465080 1466839 Oh, yeah, I got his practice all right.
1466840 1469199 Running out of here<br />before he gets his chores done.
1469200 1470880 Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?
1470881 1472080 Don't nothing set right with you.
1472081 1474519 Go on back in there, go to bed,<br />and get up on the other side.
1474520 1475879 Why something got to be wrong with me?
1475880 1477039 I ain't said nothing wrong with me.
1477040 1478599 Well, you got something to say<br />about everything.
1478600 1480560 First, it's the numbers,<br />then it's the way the man
1480561 1482480 run his restaurant,<br />then you done got on Cory.
1482481 1483999 What's it gonna be next?
1484000 1486239 Take a look up there,<br />see if the weather suit you.
1486240 1489199 Or is it gonna be how you gonna put up this<br />fence with the clothes hanging in the yard?
1489200 1490879 You hit the nail on the head then.
1490880 1493039 I know you like I know<br />the back of my hand.
1493040 1494959 Come on in here<br />and get you some more coffee,

1590480 1592194 I ain't said nothing about that.

1594960 1599639 I ain't made at you, Gabe.<br />If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.
1599640 1602230 Come on, get on out of the street.<br />Come on.
1602720 1604400 (INHALES SHAKILY)
1606080 1609910 I got me two rooms in the basement.<br />I got my own door, too.

1621560 1622839 ROSE: You hungry, Gabe?
1622840 1624640 I was just fixing to cook Troy<br />some breakfast.
1624665 1625839 I'll take some biscuits.
1625840 1627440 - Ooh, you got some biscuits?<br />- Mmm-Mmm.
1629200 1631159 Did you know, when I was in Heaven,
1631160 1633159 every morning, me and Saint Peter
1633160 1637079 would sit down by the Gate<br />and eat some big, fat biscuits?
1637080 1639239 Oh, yeah, we had us a good time.
1639240 1641559 We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.
1641560 1644239 And then Saint Peter<br />would go off to sleep,
1644240 1645919 and tell me to wake him up
1645920 1648279 when it's time to open the Gates<br />for the Judgement.
1648280 1652879 Well, come on,<br />I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.
1652880 1656879 Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name<br />in his book. I seen it.

1659040 1660999 I say, "I know him."
1661000 1664399 "He got the same name like what I got."
1664400 1666557 "That's my brother."
1667760 1670159 How many times<br />you gonna tell me that, Gabe?
1670160 1673279 Ain't got my name in the book.<br />Don't have to have my name.
1673280 1675599 I done died and went to Heaven.
1675600 1678679 But he got your name, though.
1678680 1682079 One morning,<br />Saint Peter was looking at his book,
1682080 1684839 and he was marking it up for the Judgement,
1684840 1686959 and he let me see your name.
1686960 1689879 He got it in there under "M."
1689880 1691959 He got Rose's name.
1691960 1695471 I ain't seen it like I seen yours,<br />but I know it's in there.
1695600 1699039 He got a great big book! Whoo!
1699040 1701799 He got everybody's name<br />what was ever been born.
1701800 1703275 That's what he told me.
1703800 1707079 But I seen your name.<br />I seen it with my own eye.
1707080 1708159 Come in the house.

1733480 1735559 I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn,
1735560 1740479 so Saint Peter can hear me<br />when it's time to open the Gate.
1740480 1742114 You hear that?
1744320 1747119 You hear that? That's the hellhound.
1747120 1748879 I'm gonna chase them out of here.

1817360 1818559 He ain't eating right.
1818560 1820599 Miss Pearl say<br />she can't get him to eat nothing.
1820600 1822120 What you want me to do about it, Rose?
1822145 1825479 I did everything I could for the man.<br />I can't make him get well.
1825480 1828759 Man got half his head blown off,<br />what you expect?
1828760 1830720 Seems like something ought to be done<br />to help him.
1830745 1831919 The man don't bother nobody.
1831920 1834359 He just mixed up<br />'cause of that metal plate
1834360 1837119 he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...
1837120 1840239 Thank you. Ain't no sense<br />in sending him to the hospital.
1840240 1841639 At least he'd be eating right.
1841640 1843280 They could help him take care of himself.
1843281 1844960 Don't nobody want to be locked up, Rose.
1844961 1846759 What you want to lock the man up for?
1846760 1848479 Man going down there,
1848480 1852759 over there and fight that war,<br />messing with them Japs,
1852760 1854519 getting half his head blown off.
1854520 1858319 They give him a lousy $3,000.<br />I got to swoop down on that.
1858320 1859800 Is you fixing to get into that again?
1859825 1861879 He got a metal plate in his head.
1861880 1865599 That's the only reason I got a roof over<br />my head is 'cause of that metal plate.
1865600 1867600 Ain't no sense<br />in you blaming yourself for nothing.

1874600 1877279 Till he wanted his own place<br />and moved over there with Miss Pearl.
1877280 1879995 That ain't what I'm saying, woman.<br />I'm just...
1882400 1883919 I'm just stating the facts.

2243440 2245120 (SCOFFS)<br />I ain't thinking about no Pirates.
2245121 2246440 They got an all-white team.
2246441 2249836 Got that boy, though, that Puerto Rican<br />boy, Clemente? (SCOFFS)
2249960 2251119 Don't even half play him.
2251120 2253320 That boy could be something<br />if they'd give him a chance.
2253360 2255319 Play him one day,<br />sit him on the bench the next.
2255320 2256639 He gets lots of chances to play.
2256640 2258519 I'm talking about playing every day,<br />playing regular,
2258520 2260319 so you can get your timing,<br />that's what I'm talking about.
2260320 2262479 They got some white guys on the team<br />that don't play every day.
2262480 2264160 You can't play everybody at the same time.
2264161 2266041 If they got a white fellow<br />sitting on the bench,
2266066 2268399 you can bet your last dollar<br />he can't play.
2268400 2270600 Coloured guy got to be twice as good<br />to get on the team.
2270625 2273399 That's why I don't want you<br />getting all tied up in them sports.
2273400 2275519 Man on the team, what it get him?
2275520 2277559 Got coloured on the team,<br />don't even use him.
2277560 2280399 Same as not having them.<br />All them teams the same.
2280400 2282799 The Braves got Hank Aaron<br />and Wes Covington.
2282800 2284879 Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.<br />That makes 43.
2284880 2286919 Aaron ain't nobody.<br />That's what you supposed to do.
2286920 2288799 That's how<br />the game's supposed to be played.
2288800 2291840 Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of<br />getting your timing and follow through.
2291865 2293839 Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.
2293840 2295399 Not off no major-league pitcher,<br />you couldn't.
2295400 2297120 We had better pitching<br />in the Negro leagues.
2297145 2298879 I hit seven home runs<br />off of Satchel Paige.
2298880 2300199 You can't get no better than that.
2300200 2301959 Sandy Koufax,<br />he leading the league in strikeouts.

2329120 2330959 Mr. Stawicki say<br />he gonna hold my job for me
2330960 2332560 until after the football season.
2332640 2335119 He said starting next week,<br />I can work weekends.

2347240 2349359 - I'm gonna be working weekends.<br />- You damn right you are!
2349360 2351279 And ain't no need for nobody<br />to be coming around here,
2351280 2352519 talking to me about signing nothing.
2352520 2353639 Pop, you can't do that.
2353640 2355360 He's coming all the way<br />from North Carolina.
2355385 2356999 I don't care where he coming from!
2357000 2358350 Look, boy,

2543800 2545520 Me and your mama<br />worked that out between us,
2545545 2548678 and liking your black ass<br />wasn't part of the bargain.
2548680 2550159 Now don't you go through life

2582520 2583710 (FRONT DOOR SLAMS)
2584160 2586679 Why don't you go ahead<br />and let the boy play football, Troy?
2586680 2588679 He just want to be like you<br />with the sports.
2588680 2590839 I don't want him to be like me.
2590840 2593679 I want him to get as far away from my life<br />as he possibly can get.
2593680 2596031 You the only decent thing<br />ever happened to me, Rose.
2596360 2597994 And I wish him that.
2598360 2601712 But I don't wish him<br />nothing else from my life.
2602520 2603959 I decided 17 years ago,
2603960 2606519 that boy wasn't gonna<br />get involved in no sports.
2606520 2608240 Not after what they did to me<br />in the sports.
2608241 2610560 Why don't you just admit<br />you were too old for the major leagues?
2610561 2612239 For once, why don't you just admit that?
2612240 2613999 Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.
2614000 2617359 I just wasn't the right Color.<br />Hell, I'm 53 years old,
2617360 2620519 I can do better<br />than Selkirk's.269 right now.
2620520 2622959 How were you gonna play ball<br />when you were over 40?
2622960 2624719 Sometimes, I can't get<br />no sense out of you.
2624720 2625879 I got good sense, woman.
2625880 2629199 I got sense enough not to let that boy<br />get hurt playing no sports.
2629200 2630839 You mothering the boy too much.
2630840 2633039 Worrying about whether<br />people "like" him or not.
2633040 2636399 Everything that boy do, he do for you.
2636400 2639160 He wants you to say,<br />"Good job, son." That's all.
2639400 2642599 I ain't got time for that, Rose.<br />He's alive, he's healthy.
2642600 2646079 He's got to make his own way. I made mine.
2646080 2648760 Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand<br />when he get out there in the world.
2648785 2651119 Times have changed, Troy.
2651120 2653279 People change.
2653280 2655756 The world changing,<br />and you can't even see it.
2657600 2659075 Huh.

2705280 2706994 Can't give nothing else!
2713840 2716271 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

2890080 2893400 Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there<br />and read the paper, like them white fellas.

2903200 2905080 Mr. Rand know you ain't<br />got no driver's license?
2905105 2906079 Driving ain't nothing.
2906080 2907919 All you do is point the truck<br />where you want it to go.
2907920 2909079 Driving ain't nothing.
2909080 2910719 Do they know<br />you ain't got no driver's license?
2910720 2911920 That's what I'm talkin' about.
2911945 2913319 I ain't asked if driving was easy.
2913320 2915759 I asked if Mr. Rand know<br />you ain't got no driver's license.

2916920 2919159 Time he find out, I have<br />two or three of them driver's license.
2919160 2921119 - Say, look here, Pop.<br />- I knew it was coming.
2921120 2923119 I knew what kinda<br />"Look here, Pop" that was.

3013800 3016759 The devil's strong.<br />The devil ain't no pushover.
3016760 3019279 Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.
3019280 3021959 But I got my trumpet waiting<br />on the Judgement time.
3021960 3023840 LYONS: Waiting on<br />the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

3044200 3045440 You want me to fix you a plate?
3045465 3048359 I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.<br />I don't want no plate.
3048360 3050559 I want to eat with my hands.<br />I'll take a sandwich.
3050560 3052200 ROSE: What about you, Lyons? You stayin'?
3052201 3053480 Got some short ribs cooking.
3053481 3056711 Nah. I won't eat nothing<br />till after we finish playing.
3057160 3059239 You ought to come down,<br />listen to me play, Pop.
3059240 3061599 Oh, I don't like all that Chinese music,<br />all that noise.
3061600 3065159 ROSE: Go in there and wash up, Gabe.<br />I'll fix you a sandwich.
3065160 3067879 - Troy mad at me.<br />- Huh?
3067880 3069319 What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?
3069320 3072239 ROSE: He think Troy mad at him 'cause<br />he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.
3072240 3074399 I ain't mad at the man.<br />He can live where he want to live at.
3074400 3076639 Well, what he move over there for?<br />Miss Pearl don't like nobody.
3076640 3078479 Oh, she don't mind him none.<br />She treat him real nice.
3078480 3080039 She just don't allow all that singing.
3080040 3082679 She don't mind that rent he be paying.<br />That's what she don't mind.
3082680 3084279 Troy, I ain't goin' through that<br />with you no more.
3084280 3086159 He moved over there<br />'cause he wanted his own place.
3086160 3087319 He can come and go as he please.
3087320 3089519 He can come and go as he please here.<br />I wasn't stoppin' him.
3089520 3090839 I wasn't putting no rules on the man.
3090840 3092679 That ain't the same thing,<br />and you know it.
3092680 3093999 Now that's the last<br />I wanna hear about that.
3094000 3096281 I don't wanna hear nothin' else<br />about Gabe and Miss Pearl.
3096306 3097399 And next week...
3097400 3098999 I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.
3099000 3101240 And next week, when that recruiter<br />come from that school,
3101265 3103999 I want you to sign that paper<br />and go on and let Cory play football.
3104000 3105919 That'll be the last<br />I have to hear about that.
3110400 3112519 Cory got recruited?<br />What school he goin' to?
3112520 3114199 I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.
3114200 3117999 Boy walking around here smelling his piss,<br />thinking he gonna do what he want to do,
3118000 3120359 irregardless of what I say.
3120360 3124199 Look here, Bono, I left the Commissioner's<br />office and went down to the A&P.
3124200 3126479 That boy ain't workin' down there,<br />he lied to me.
3126480 3129919 Tellin' me he got his job back,<br />tellin' me he workin' weekend,
3129920 3131559 tellin' me he workin' after school.
3131560 3133879 Mr. Stawicki says<br />he ain't working down there at all.
3133880 3135159 Cory just growing up.
3135160 3137319 He just bustin' at the seams,<br />tryin' to fill out your shoes.
3137320 3138559 I don't care what he doing.
3138560 3140719 When he get to the place<br />where he want to disobey me,
3140720 3143959 then it's time for him to move on.<br />Bono will tell you that.
3143960 3147719 I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy<br />without paying the consequences.
3147720 3150079 (CHUCKLES) I ain't never had the chance.
3150080 3153759 My daddy came on through,<br />but I ain't never knew him to see him.
3153760 3156439 Or what he had on his mind,<br />or where he went.
3156440 3160316 Just moving on through.<br />Searching out the New Land.
3161000 3163399 That's what the old folks used to call it.
3163400 3166919 See a fella moving around<br />from place to place, woman to woman,
3166920 3169399 they call it "Searching out the New Land."
3169400 3171239 I can't say if he ever found it.
3171800 3174469 I come along, didn't want no kids.
3174760 3176960 I didn't know if I was gonna<br />be in one place long enough
3176985 3178919 to fix on 'em right as their daddy.
3178920 3181119 I figured I was going searching, too.
3181120 3183439 As it turn out,<br />I been hooked up with Lucille
3183440 3185919 for near about as long as<br />your daddy been with Rose.
3185920 3188159 Going on 16 years.
3188160 3190119 TROY: Sometimes, I wish<br />I'd never known my daddy.
3190120 3194075 He ain't cared nothing about no kids.<br />A kid to him wasn't nothing.
3194280 3197519 All he wanted you to do<br />was learn how to walk,
3197520 3199279 so he could start you to working.
3199280 3203119 Come to eating, he ate first.<br />Anything left over, that's what you got.
3203120 3206279 Man would sit down,<br />eat two chickens, and give you the wing.
3206280 3209639 You ought to stop that, Pop.<br />Everybody feed their kids.
3209640 3212839 No matter how hard times is,<br />everybody care about their kids.
3212840 3214320 Make sure they have something to eat.
3214345 3217799 Only thing my daddy cared about was getting<br />them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.
3217800 3219919 That's the only thing<br />that mattered to him.
3219920 3222159 Sometimes, I used to wonder<br />why he was still living,
3222160 3224920 why the devil hadn't come and got him.
3224960 3226959 "Get them bales of cotton<br />in to Mr. Lubin."
3226960 3228399 Find out he owe him money.
3228400 3230679 LYONS: He should have just went on and<br />left when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.
3230680 3231800 That's what I would've done.
3231825 3234799 How he gonna leave with 11 kids?<br />And where he gonna go?
3234800 3238198 He ain't knew nothing but how to farm.<br />No, he was trapped.
3238400 3241639 I think he knew it, too.<br />But I'll say this for him...
3241640 3243479 He felt a responsibility toward us.
3243480 3245559 May not have treated us<br />like I felt he should have,
3245560 3249599 but without that responsibility,<br />he could have run off and left us,
3249600 3250999 made his own way.
3251000 3252479 A lot of them did.
3252480 3254160 Back in those days,<br />what you talkin' about?
3254185 3255879 - Mmm-Mmm.<br />- They walk out their front door
3255880 3259159 and take off down one road or another<br />and just keep on walkin'.
3259160 3261159 There you go.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
3261160 3264599 Just keep on walking<br />till they come to something else.
3264600 3267999 Ain't you never heard of nobody<br />having the walking blues?
3268000 3270639 Now, that's what you call it<br />when you just take off like that.
3270640 3273239 Mmm, my daddy ain't had no walking blues.
3273240 3274519 What you talking about?
3274520 3276200 He stayed right there with his family,
3276840 3280879 but he was just as evil as he could be!
3280880 3284599 My mama couldn't stand him.<br />Couldn't stand that evilness.
3284600 3287719 She run off when I was about eight.
3287720 3290919 She sneaked off one night,<br />told me she was coming back for me.
3290920 3292719 I ain't never seen her no more.
3292720 3297039 All his women run off and left him.<br />He wasn't good for nobody.
3297360 3299119 My turn come to head out.
3299120 3300559 I was 14,
3300560 3303519 got to sniffing around<br />Joe Canewell's daughter.
3303520 3304799 (CHUCKLES)
3304800 3307239 We had this old mule called "Greyboy".
3307240 3309439 My daddy sent me out to do some ploughing.
3309440 3313199 I got to fooling around<br />with Joe Canewell's daughter.
3313200 3316479 Found us a nice spot,<br />got real cozy with each other.
3316480 3319759 She was about 13,<br />so we done figured we grown anyway.
3319760 3322239 So, we were down there by the creek,<br />enjoying ourselves,
3322240 3323719 ain't thinking about nothing.
3323720 3326119 Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,
3326120 3329757 wandered back to the house,<br />and my daddy was lookin' for me.
3329840 3333399 So, we down there enjoying ourselves<br />when he come up on us.
3333400 3335599 Surprised us.
3335600 3338199 Had them leather straps off that mule,
3338200 3341319 commenced to whupping me<br />like there was no tomorrow.
3341320 3344115 I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.
3344600 3346917 I was scared of my daddy.
3346920 3348999 Now, when he commenced to whipping on me,
3349000 3350799 quite naturally,<br />I run to get out of the way.
3350800 3353559 Now, I think he's mad<br />'cause I ain't done my work.
3353560 3356279 But I see where he's chasing me off,
3356280 3358392 so he can have the gal for himself.
3359600 3361917 When I see what the matter of it was,
3362600 3366959 I lost all fear of my daddy,<br />and right there, I became a man.
3366960 3369439 Fourteen years of age.
3369440 3372439 Now, it's my turn to run him off.
3372440 3374319 I picked up them same reins he used on me.
3374320 3378116 I picked up them reins,<br />I commenced to whupping on him.
3378960 3381470 Gal jump up, she run off.
3383200 3384519 When he turned to face me,
3384520 3386479 I knew why the devil<br />never come and get him
3386480 3388831 'cause he was the devil himself.
3389960 3392599 I don't know what happened.
3392600 3395879 (CHUCKLING) I woke up,<br />laying there by the creek,
3395880 3399639 and Blue, this old dog we had,<br />he was licking my face.
3399640 3402759 Both my eyes were swoll shut.
3402760 3404679 I thought I was blind,<br />I couldn't see nothing.
3404680 3408590 I just laid there and cried.
3413960 3416959 And I didn't know what I was gonna do.
3416960 3421598 But I knew the time had come<br />for me to leave my daddy's house.
3422680 3425190 Suddenly, the world got big, and...
3428080 3432194 It was a long time before I could<br />cut it down to where I could handle it.
3433680 3436599 Part of that cutting down<br />was where I got to the place
3436600 3438679 where I could feel him<br />kicking in my blood,
3438680 3440360 and I knew the only thing<br />that separated us
3440385 3442702 was a matter of a few years.
3443480 3445034 (DOOR CLOSES)
3445520 3447074 LYONS: What you got there, Uncle Gabe?
3447880 3449399 I got me a ham sandwich.
3449400 3451751 Rose gave me a ham sandwich.
3454040 3456391 I lost touch with everybody<br />except Gabriel.
3461200 3462390 But...
3465880 3467912 I hope he's dead.
3471960 3474719 I hope he found some peace.
3474720 3476957 LYONS: That's a heavy story, Pop.
3478160 3482079 I didn't know you left home<br />when you was 14.
3482080 3484199 Fourteen's kinda young to be on your own.
3484200 3486278 I don't know what I would've done.
3486840 3489719 Well, I got up from that creek,<br />walked on down to Mobile.
3489720 3493479 I was through with farming.<br />I figured I'd do better in the cities.
3493480 3495399 So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.
3495400 3497919 Wait a minute,<br />you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.
3497920 3499079 (PHONE RINGING)
3499080 3501199 Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.
3501200 3503239 You talking about some walking there!
3503240 3506079 That's the only way you got anywhere<br />back in them days.
3506080 3508999 Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have<br />hitched a ride with somebody.
3509000 3510880 - (BOTH LAUGHING)<br />- Who you gonna hitch it with?
3510881 3512801 There ain't no cars<br />and things like they got now.
3512826 3514359 We talking about 1918.
3514360 3515999 What you all out here gettin' into?
3516000 3518279 I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.
3518280 3519639 He don't know nothing<br />about this I'm talking.
3519640 3521119 Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.
3521120 3522600 She says you supposed to pick her up.
3522625 3524319 Yeah, okay, Rose.
3524320 3527119 I walked on down to Mobile,
3527120 3530479 hitched up with some fellows<br />that was coming up this way.
3530480 3532199 Got up here and found out,
3532200 3533839 not only could you not get a job,
3533840 3535439 you couldn't find no place to live.
3535440 3538280 I thought I was in freedom. (SCOFFS)
3538360 3540839 Coloured folks living down there<br />on the riverbanks
3540840 3543160 in whatever kind of shelter<br />they could find for themselves.
3543185 3545854 Right down there<br />under the Brady Street Bridge.
3546040 3549551 Living down there in shacks<br />made out of sticks and tar paper.
3550400 3552199 Messed around down there.
3552200 3554799 Went from bad to worse. Started stealing.
3554800 3557479 First, it was food.<br />Then I figure I steal me some money,
3557480 3560149 I can buy me some food,<br />buy me some shoes, too.
3560280 3562233 One thing led to another. Met your mama.
3562480 3564990 I was young, anxious to be a man.
3565360 3567799 I met your mama and had you.<br />Why'd I do that for?
3567800 3570319 Now, I got to worry about<br />feeding you and her.
3570320 3572000 Got to steal three times as much.
3572640 3576159 I went out one day<br />looking for somebody to rob.
3576160 3577635 That's what I was, I was a robber.
3578160 3579839 I'ma tell you the truth.
3579840 3581952 I'm ashamed of it today,<br />but it's the truth.
3582800 3584759 I went to rob this fella,<br />I pull out my knife.
3584760 3586999 He pulled out a gun, shot me in the chest.
3587000 3590319 It felt like somebody had taken<br />a hot branding iron and laid it on me.
3590320 3593558 Now, when he shot me,<br />I jumped at him with my knife,
3595240 3597159 and they say I killed him.
3597160 3599319 Locked me up, put me<br />in the penitentiary for 15 years.
3599320 3600874 That's where I met Bono.
3601240 3603599 Where I learned how to play baseball.
3603600 3605480 Got out that place,<br />and your mama had taken you,
3605505 3607279 went on to make a life without me.
3607280 3609439 Fifteen years was a long time<br />for her to wait.
3609440 3611399 But that 15 years<br />cured me of that robbing stuff.
3611400 3612839 Rose'll tell you.
3612840 3615199 I first met her, she ask me if I had
3615200 3617439 gotten all that foolishness<br />out of my system.
3617440 3619359 I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball",
3619360 3621159 "all what count to me." You hear me, Bono?
3621160 3623879 And I meant it, too.<br />She said, "Which one come first?"
3623880 3627039 I said, "Well, ain't no<br />doubt it's baseball."
3627040 3629079 "But you stick and get old with me,"
3629080 3630719 "and we'll both outlive this baseball."
3630720 3633037 Am I right, Rose?
3634040 3635199 And it's true.
3635200 3637160 Man, hush your mouth.<br />You ain't say no such thing.
3637161 3639841 Talkin' about, "Baby, you know<br />you'll always be number one with me."
3639866 3642399 That's what you was talking.
3642400 3643719 That's why I love this woman.
3643720 3645080 BONO: Rose will keep you straight.
3645105 3647159 You get off the track,<br />she'll straighten you up.
3647160 3648840 Lyons, you better get on up<br />and get Bonnie.
3648865 3650159 She waiting on you.
3650160 3651519 - Hey, Pop.<br />- Yeah?
3651520 3653757 You ought to come down to the Grill,<br />hear me play.
3654200 3655999 Oh, man, I ain't goin' down there.

3657745 3660879 You got to be good to<br />play down at the Grill.
3660880 3662439 Come on, Pop.
3662440 3666429 - I got to get up in the morning.<br />- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.
3667240 3671116 No, I'm gonna eat my supper and go to bed.
3672000 3675034 Well, I got to go. I'll see you later.

3683240 3685360 and bring Bonnie,<br />you know I'm always glad to see her.
3685385 3688839 I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.
3688840 3690439 - See you, Pop.<br />- All right.
3690440 3692599 See you, Mr. Bono.

3717200 3719119 and we still standin'<br />shoulder to shoulder.
3719120 3722599 Look here, Bono,<br />a man can't ask for no more than that.
3722600 3723919 I love you, nigger.
3723920 3725959 - Oh, hell! I love you, too.<br />- (LAUGHING)
3725960 3729153 But I got to get home, see my woman.<br />You got yours in hand.

3732760 3734719 CORY: What you do that for, Pop?
3734720 3736159 ROSE: What's the matter?<br />Cory, what's the matter?
3736160 3737999 Pop done went up to the school<br />and told Coach Zellman
3738000 3739239 I can't play football no more.
3739240 3740879 Wouldn't even let me play the game.
3740880 3742600 Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.
3742625 3744319 - ROSE: Troy.<br />- What you Troy'in me for?
3744320 3745999 Yeah, I did it.<br />And the boy knows why I did it.
3746000 3747959 Why you wanna do that to me?<br />That was the one chance I had!
3747960 3749479 Ain't nothing wrong<br />with Cory playing football, Troy.
3749480 3750719 The boy lied to me.
3750720 3753319 I told the nigger,<br />"You want to play football,
3753320 3754679 "you keep up with your chores
3754680 3757279 "hold that job down at the A&P."<br />That was the conditions.
3757280 3758839 I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...

3761640 3763879 I tried to tell you<br />Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.
3763880 3766679 You don't never want to listen to nobody,<br />and then you wanna go and do this to me?
3766680 3768319 I ain't done nothin' to you.<br />You done it to yourself.

3986200 3989039 Yeah, I know what you mean.<br />That's all they care about, that money.
3989040 3991311 They don't care about what's right.
3992480 3997039 Nigger, why you got to go<br />and get some hardwood?
3997040 3999399 You ain't doing nothin'<br />but building a little old fence.

4028200 4031319 gonna pull their own teeth<br />with a pair of rusty pliers?

4032520 4034519 My granddaddy used to<br />pull his teeth with pliers.
4034520 4036759 They ain't had no dentists<br />for coloured folk back then.

4094080 4096039 Some people build fences<br />to keep people out,
4096040 4098550 and other people build fences<br />to keep people in.
4099320 4101830 Rose wants to hold on to you all.<br />She loves you.
4102360 4105439 Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody<br />to tell me my wife loves me.
4105440 4109039 Cory, go in the house<br />and see if you can find the other saw.

4149600 4151959 A lot of them old gals was after you then.
4151960 4153999 You had the pick of the litter.
4154000 4157796 When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.
4158480 4162071 That's the first time<br />I knew you had any sense.
4162240 4165239 I said, "My man Troy<br />knows what he's doing."
4165240 4168592 "I'm gonna follow this nigger,<br />he might take me somewhere."
4168800 4170919 I been following you, too.
4170920 4174670 I done learned a whole heap of things<br />about life watching you.
4175960 4179319 I done learned how to tell<br />where the shit lies.
4179320 4181796 How to tell it from the alfalfa.
4182320 4184879 You done learned me a lot of things.

4187960 4189839 To take life as it come along,
4189840 4192714 keep putting one foot<br />in front of the other.
4193000 4194439 Rose is a good woman, Troy.
4194440 4195719 I know she a good woman.
4195720 4197319 I've been married to her for 18 years.
4197320 4198759 What you got on your mind, Bono?
4198760 4201239 I just say she's a good woman,<br />like I say anything.
4201240 4202639 I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.
4202640 4205440 You just say she a good woman<br />and leave it hanging out there like that?
4205441 4207041 Why are you telling me she a good woman?
4207066 4209239 - She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.<br />- Uh-huh.
4209240 4210559 You saying I don't measure up?
4210560 4211879 That's what you tryin' to say.
4211880 4213920 I don't measure up<br />'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

4227000 4229874 Well, I appreciate that, Bono.
4231720 4235479 If you was messing around on Lucille,<br />I'd be telling you the same thing.

4238040 4241199 I just say that 'cause I love you both.
4241480 4244240 Oh. Yeah.
4244880 4247439 You know me.<br />I wasn't out there looking for nothing.
4247440 4250075 You can't find<br />a better woman than Rose, I know that.
4250200 4253119 But it seems like<br />this woman just stuck on to me
4253120 4254359 where I can't shake her loose.
4254360 4256360 I done wrestled with it<br />and tried to throw her off,
4256385 4258559 but now she stuck on tighter.
4258560 4260959 And now she stuck on for good.
4260960 4263799 You's in control.<br />That's what you tell me all the time.
4263800 4265639 You responsible for what you do.
4265640 4267479 I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.
4267480 4269959 As long as it set right in my heart,<br />then I'm okay.
4269960 4272959 'Cause that's all I listen to.<br />It tell me right and wrong every time.
4272960 4274880 And I ain't talking about<br />doing Rose no bad turn.
4274905 4276399 I love Rose.
4276400 4279479 She done carried me a long ways,<br />and I love and respect her for that.
4279480 4280719 I know you do.
4280720 4282919 That's why I don't want<br />to see you hurt her.
4282920 4285510 But what you gonna do when she finds out?
4285760 4287919 What you got then?
4287920 4289399 You try to juggle both of them,
4289400 4291239 sooner or later,<br />you gonna drop one of them.
4291240 4293636 - That's common sense.<br />- I know what you're saying, Bono.
4295160 4297279 I been trying to figure a way<br />to work it out.
4297280 4299439 Work it out right, Troy.
4299440 4302159 I ain't trying to get all up<br />between you and Rose's business,
4302160 4304439 but work it, so it come out right.
4304440 4306759 Hell, I get all between<br />you and Lucille's business.
4306760 4309799 And when you gonna buy that woman<br />that refrigerator she be wanting?
4309800 4311559 And don't tell me you ain't got no money.
4311560 4312919 I know who your banker is.
4312920 4315720 Mellon don't need that money<br />as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.
4315745 4316599 I know that.
4316600 4317840 - Tell you what I'll do.<br />- What?
4317865 4321599 When you finish building this fence for<br />Rose, I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.
4321600 4324679 You done stuck your foot<br />in your mouth now. (CHUCKLES)
4325600 4327279 Hey, nigger, where you going?
4327280 4328599 I'm going home.
4328600 4330519 I know you don't expect me<br />to help you now.
4330520 4332154 I'm protecting my money.
4332440 4335439 I want to see you<br />put that fence up by yourself.
4335440 4337119 That's what I want to see.
4337120 4339479 You'll be here<br />another six months without me.
4339480 4340879 Nigger, you ain't right.
4340880 4342639 When it come to my money,
4342640 4345799 I'm right as fireworks<br />on the Fourth of July.
4345800 4347359 - (LAUGHS)<br />- We gonna see.
4347360 4349079 You better get out your bank book!
4349080 4350794 (BONO LAUGHING)
4401000 4403159 What they say down there?<br />What's happening with Gabe?
4403160 4406199 (SIGHS) I went down there<br />and got him out. Cost me $50.
4406200 4407719 Said he was disturbing the peace.
4407720 4410239 Judge set up a hearing for him<br />in three weeks
4410240 4412919 to show cause<br />why he shouldn't be recommitted.
4412920 4414793 What'd you say? What'd you tell the judge?
4415000 4416719 I told him I'd take care of him.
4416720 4418440 It didn't make no sense<br />to recommit the man.
4418465 4419839 He stuck out his big greasy palm,
4419840 4422599 told me to give him $50<br />and take him on home.
4422600 4424599 Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?
4424600 4426599 Gone about his business.<br />He don't need nobody to hold his hand.
4426600 4428879 Well, I don't know, seem like<br />that would be the best place for him.
4428880 4429959 To put him in a hospital.
4429960 4432639 I know what you gonna say,<br />but that's what I think would be best.
4432640 4434359 Man had his life ruined fighting for what?
4434360 4436040 Now, they want to take him<br />and lock him up?
4436065 4438190 Let him be free.<br />Man ain't bothering nobody.
4438200 4442039 (SIGHS) Everybody got<br />their own way of looking at it, I guess.
4442040 4443359 Come on, get your lunch.
4443360 4445039 I got some Lima beans<br />and cornbread in the oven.
4445040 4446240 Come on, get somethin' to eat.
4446265 4447919 Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.
4447920 4449280 Rose, I got something to tell you.
4449305 4452339 - Wait till I put the food on the table.<br />- Rose...
4452920 4455954 Now, I don't know how to tell you this.
4459680 4461799 And I can't explain it none.
4461800 4465152 It just sort of grows on you.
4465960 4470559 It started off like a little bush, next<br />thing you know, it's a whole forest.
4470560 4471959 Troy, what is you talking about?
4471960 4473839 I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.
4473840 4475719 I'm trying to tell you,
4475720 4478355 find a way to tell you that...
4479680 4481200 (SIGHING)
4483240 4485750 I'm gonna be a daddy.
4487720 4490196 Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.
4494560 4497399 Troy, you ain't telling me this.<br />You're gonna be what?
4497400 4499160 - You're gonna be somebody's daddy?<br />- Rose...
4499161 4500361 You're telling your wife this?
4500386 4501079 Now...
4501080 4503399 GABRIEL: Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!
4503400 4506079 I got to wait 18 years<br />to hear something like this?
4506080 4507509 Hey, Rose.
4507560 4509160 (PANTING)
4509240 4511796 I got a flower for you.
4514280 4518030 That's a rose. The same rose like you is.
4522840 4524359 Thanks, Gabe.
4524360 4525839 GABRIEL: Troy, you ain't mad at me?
4525840 4527359 Them bad men come and put me away.
4527360 4529839 - You ain't mad at me?<br />- No. No, I ain't mad at you.
4529840 4531879 Eighteen years,<br />and you want to come with this?
4531880 4534720 See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.
4537440 4538599 Rose, it's just that...
4538600 4540879 Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.<br />Ain't no explaining it.
4540880 4543639 The fella that give me this quarter<br />had a whole mess of 'em!
4543640 4546199 I'm gonna keep this quarter<br />till it stops shining.
4546200 4548839 Gabe, go on up front now.<br />I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.
4548840 4550079 Go on. I'll get you a piece.
4550080 4552879 Say, Rose, you know,<br />I was chasing hellhounds,
4552880 4555879 and them bad men come<br />and get me and take me away.
4555880 4557959 Troy helped me.<br />He come down there and told them
4557960 4560959 they better let me go<br />before he beat them up!
4560960 4562319 Yeah, he did!
4562320 4564679 Go up front now, Gabe.<br />I'll get you some watermelon.
4564680 4566239 Them bad men is gone now.
4566240 4568679 Okay. Rose gonna give me some watermelon,
4568680 4571349 the kind with the stripes on it.
4576640 4578274 Why, Troy?
4579840 4581159 Why?
4581160 4586679 After all these years,<br />you come dragging this in to me now?
4586680 4589031 It don't make no sense at your age.
4589520 4593509 I could've expected this<br />10, or 15 years ago, but not now.
4593600 4596031 Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.
4599920 4603397 I done tried to be everything<br />a wife should be.
4605200 4606559 Everything a wife could be.
4606560 4607919 I've been married 18 years,
4607920 4610519 and now,<br />I got to live to see the day you tell me
4610520 4614236 you been seeing another woman<br />and done fathered a child by her.
4614800 4616480 (OBJECTS CLATTER)
4620280 4622073 (SOBBING)
4627200 4631394 And you know I never wanted<br />no half-nothing in my family!
4634200 4635559 My whole family is half.
4635560 4637479 Everybody got different<br />fathers and mothers
4637480 4639039 and my two sisters and my brothers.
4639040 4640719 You could hardly tell who's who.
4640720 4642680 Could never sit down<br />and talk about Papa and Mama.
4642705 4645279 It was always your papa,<br />your mama, my papa, my mama.
4645280 4647879 And I ain't never wanted that<br />for none of my children!
4647880 4649279 And now,<br />you want to drag your behind in here
4649280 4650560 and tell me something like this!
4650561 4652842 Stop it now. You ought to know.<br />It's time for you to know.
4652867 4654705 Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!
4664600 4666314 (DOOR SLAMS)
4667760 4670520 (BREATHING HEAVILY)
4674240 4675510 Rose?
4678440 4681919 I just can't make it go away.<br />It's done now.
4681920 4685999 I can't wish the circumstances<br />of the thing away.
4686000 4688679 And you don't want to, either. (SNIFFLES)
4688680 4690559 Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.
4690560 4692039 Maybe that's what you want.
4692040 4694599 Well, you can't wish us away.
4694600 4696639 I got 18 years of my life invested in you.
4696640 4699040 You ought to have stayed upstairs<br />in my bed where you belong.
4699065 4701439 Now, listen to me.<br />We can get a handle on this thing.
4701440 4703359 We can talk this out,<br />come to an understanding.
4703360 4704719 All of a sudden it's "we."
4704720 4706039 Where was "we" at<br />when you were down there,
4706040 4707439 rolling around<br />with some godforsaken woman?
4707440 4708759 "We" should've come to an understanding
4708760 4710720 before you started making<br />a damn fool of yourself!
4710721 4713841 You're a day late and a dollar short when<br />it comes to an understanding with me.
4713866 4719463 Rose, it's just that<br />she gives me a different idea.
4719600 4722839 A different understanding about myself.
4722840 4726399 I can step out of this house<br />and get away from the pressures
4726400 4727880 and the problems, be a different man.
4727905 4731439 I ain't got to worry about how I'll get<br />the roof fixed, or pay the bills, or...
4731440 4732960 I can just
4734720 4737515 be a part of myself<br />I ain't never been before.
4738520 4740871 What I want to know is...
4743200 4745799 What I want to know
4745800 4748519 is do you plan to continue seeing her?
4748520 4751030 That's all you can say to me.
4752120 4753839 I could sit up in her house and laugh.
4753840 4756279 You understand what I'm saying?
4756280 4758959 I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.
4758960 4761279 It reaches all the way down<br />to the bottom of my shoes.
4761280 4762675 Rose, I...
4764880 4767879 I can't give that up.
4773480 4775840 Well, maybe you ought to go on<br />and stay down there with her,
4775865 4777479 if she's a better woman than me.
4777480 4779640 It ain't about nobody being<br />a better woman, or nothing.
4779665 4780719 Rose, you ain't to blame.
4780720 4783079 A man couldn't ask<br />for a better wife than you've been.
4783080 4784639 I'm responsible for it.
4784640 4786279 I done locked myself into a pattern,
4786280 4788600 trying to take care of you all,<br />that I forgot about myself.
4788625 4790079 Well, what the hell was I there for?
4790080 4791719 That was my job, not somebody else's.
4791720 4794919 Rose, listen to me.<br />I done tried all my life to live decent.
4794920 4797919 To live a clean, hard, useful life.
4797920 4801159 I try to be a good husband to you,<br />in every way I know how.
4801160 4803439 Maybe I come into the world backwards,<br />I don't know,
4803440 4806839 but you're born with two strikes on you<br />before you come to the plate.
4806840 4810759 You got to guard it closely, always looking<br />for the curveball on the inside corner.
4810760 4812479 You can't afford a called strike.
4812480 4813919 You can't let nothing get past you.
4813920 4816119 If you're going down,<br />you're doing down swinging.
4816120 4819040 Everything lined up against you!
4820520 4822234 What you gonna do?
4823640 4826275 I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.
4826520 4830439 When I found you and Cory<br />and a halfway decent job, I was safe.
4830440 4832719 Couldn't nothing touch me!
4832720 4834239 I wasn't gonna strike out no more.
4834240 4835840 I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.
4835865 4838159 I wasn't gonna<br />lie in the street with a bottle of wine.
4838160 4842639 I was safe. I had me a family,<br />(STAMMERS) a job.
4843640 4846514 I wasn't gonna get that last strike.
4848080 4851039 I was standing on first base,
4851040 4853079 waiting for one of them boys<br />to knock me in, to bring me home.
4853080 4854959 You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
4854960 4856760 Then I saw the gal,<br />she firmed up my backbone.
4856785 4859519 I got to thinkin' that if I tried,<br />maybe I could steal second.
4859520 4861400 - You understand?<br />- You should've held me tight.
4861425 4864559 - You should've grabbed me and held on.<br />- I stood on first base for 18 years,
4864560 4867039 and I thought, well,<br />God damn it, go on for it!
4867040 4869519 We ain't talking about baseball!
4869520 4871919 We talking about you going off<br />and laying up with another woman,
4871920 4872999 then bringing it home to me.
4873000 4875720 That's what we're talking about.<br />We're not talkin' about no baseball!
4875721 4877041 Rose, you're not listening to me.
4877066 4879784 I'm trying to explain it to you<br />the best way I know how.
4881080 4885639 It's not easy for me to admit that I've been<br />standing in the same place for 18 years!
4885640 4888239 Well, I've been standing with you!
4888240 4892359 I've been right here with you, Troy!<br />I got a life, too.
4892360 4896679 I gave 18 years of my life<br />to stand in the same spot as you!
4896680 4898719 Don't you think<br />I ever wanted other things?
4898720 4900919 Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?
4900920 4903599 What about my life? What about me?
4903600 4906279 Don't you think it ever crossed my mind<br />to want to know other men?
4906280 4910679 That I wanted to lay up somewhere<br />and forget about my responsibilities?
4910680 4914479 That I wanted someone to<br />make me laugh, so I could feel good?
4914480 4916679 You're not the only one<br />who's got wants and needs.
4916680 4918679 But I held on to you, Troy.
4918680 4922919 I took all my feelings,<br />my wants and needs and dreams,
4922920 4924799 and I buried them inside you.
4924800 4927159 I planted a seed<br />and watched and prayed over it.
4927160 4930239 I planted myself inside you<br />and waited to bloom!
4930240 4934159 And it didn't take me no 18 years<br />to realize the soil was hard and rocky,
4934160 4936359 and it wasn't never gonna bloom!
4936360 4939359 But I held on to you, Troy.<br />I held you tighter.
4939360 4941439 You was my husband.
4941440 4944159 I owed you everything I had.
4944160 4946959 Every part of me I could find to give you.
4946960 4950879 And upstairs in that bedroom,<br />with the darkness falling in on me,
4950880 4955039 I gave everything I had<br />to try and erase the doubt
4955040 4957799 that you wasn't the finest man<br />in the world.
4957800 4960599 And wherever you was going,<br />I was gonna be there with you,
4960600 4963235 because you was my husband.
4964480 4967673 'Cause that's the only way<br />I was gonna survive as your wife.
4968720 4972596 You always talking about what you give<br />and what you don't have to give.
4973080 4974879 But you take, too, Troy.
4974880 4977599 You take and don't even<br />know nobody's giving.
4977600 4978800 You say I take and don't give.
4978825 4979919 Troy, you're hurting me.
4979920 4982199 - Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!<br />- I gave you everything I got.
4982200 4983400 Don't you tell that lie on me.
4983425 4984759 - Mama!<br />- Don't you tell that lie!
4984760 4986474 Troy, you're hurting me!
4986880 4988434 Troy! Troy!
4988640 4992516 All right. That's strike two.
4993160 4997559 You stay away from around me, boy.<br />Don't you strike out.
4999040 5001232 You're living with a full count.
5004600 5006598 Don't you strike out!

5102920 5104679 (INAUDIBLE)

5211360 5213631 All of a sudden?
5215480 5218149 After all this time,<br />you want to talk to me, huh?
5219040 5220680 You ain't wanted to talk to me in months.
5220681 5222361 You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.
5222386 5223985 You didn't want no parts of me then.
5224120 5226312 What you want to talk to me about now?
5229760 5231319 Tomorrow's Friday.
5231320 5232799 I know what day tomorrow is.

5236320 5237720 and you got to tell me it's Friday.

5242320 5244000 Ain't never been a night<br />I ain't come home.
5244025 5245639 That ain't what I mean, and you know it.
5245640 5249159 I wanna know if you're coming<br />straight home after work.
5249160 5252199 I figured I'd cash my check,<br />hang out at Taylors' with the boys.
5252200 5253400 Maybe play a game of checkers.
5253425 5256079 Troy, I can't live like this.<br />I won't live like this.
5256080 5257640 You're living on borrowed time with me.
5257641 5259881 Been going on six months now,<br />you ain't been coming home.
5259882 5261920 I come home every night.<br />Every night of the year.
5261921 5264429 That's 365 days.
5265760 5268555 I want you to come home<br />tomorrow after work.
5273360 5277119 Rose, I don't mess up my pay.<br />You know that.

5279080 5282519 I don't have no money<br />but what you give me back.
5282520 5285799 I just want a little time to myself.
5285800 5287039 A little time to enjoy life.
5287040 5288999 What about me?<br />When's my time to enjoy life?
5289000 5291159 I don't know what to tell you, Rose.<br />I'm doing the best I can.
5291160 5292279 You ain't been comin' home from work,
5292280 5294280 but time enough<br />to change your clothes and run out.
5294305 5296497 You wanna call that the best you can do?
5297280 5300552 I'm going over to the hospital<br />to see Alberta.
5301480 5303239 She went into the hospital this afternoon.
5303240 5306877 Looks like she might have the baby early.
5307560 5309433 I won't be gone long.
5315640 5318799 Well, you ought to know. They went over<br />to Miss Pearl's and got Gabe today.
5318800 5322639 She said you told them to<br />go ahead and lock him up.
5322640 5326679 I ain't said no such thing.<br />Whoever told you that is telling a lie.
5326680 5328479 Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing<br />but telling a big, fat lie.
5328480 5330439 She ain't had to tell me.<br />I read it on the papers.
5330440 5332439 - What'd it say, huh?<br />- It said you told them to take him.
5332440 5334919 Oh, well, then they screwed that up,<br />just like they screw up everything.
5334920 5336239 I ain't worried about<br />what they got on that paper.
5336240 5338239 It say the government sends<br />part of the check to the hospital,
5338240 5339399 the other part to you.
5339400 5341119 I got nothing to do with that,<br />if that's the way it works.
5341120 5342319 I don't make up the rules...
5342320 5343760 You did Gabe just like you did Cory.
5343761 5346760 You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory, but<br />you signed for Gabe! You signed that paper!
5346761 5348599 I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.
5348600 5350279 Hell, the only thing I signed<br />was the release form.
5350280 5352759 Hell, I can't read, I don't know<br />what they had on that paper.
5352760 5354679 I ain't signed nothing<br />about sending Gabe away.
5354680 5356919 I said send him to the hospital,<br />you said let him go free.
5356920 5359559 Then you went down there and you signed<br />him to the hospital for half his money.
5359560 5361959 You went back on yourself, Troy.<br />You're gonna have to answer for that.
5361960 5363599 You just been over there<br />talking to Miss Pearl.

6623560 6626359 Every time I heard<br />your footsteps in this house.
6626360 6628279 Wondering all the time,<br />"What's Pop gonna say if I do this?"
6628280 6629680 "What's he gonna say if I do that?"

6631640 6633119 And Mum, too!<br />She tries, but she's scared of you.

6977360 6978799 Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.
6978800 6980840 They don't know<br />if they're gonna let him out or not.
6980865 6982319 I talked to them a little while ago.
6982320 6984799 LYONS: A corporal<br />in the United States Marines.
6984800 6986999 Your daddy knew you had it in you.

7039200 7040720 You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?
7040745 7042359 I know they ain't feeding you right.
7042360 7044040 No, Mama, thanks.<br />I don't feel like eating.
7044065 7045335 I'll get something later.
7046160 7049034 Raynell, get up there<br />and get that dress on like I told you.
7060120 7063438 I always knew you was gonna<br />make something out of yourself.

7081400 7085079 Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.
7085080 7087112 Ain't nothing out here.
7088480 7091514 I guess Rose told you<br />about what happened with me.
7091640 7092830 (CHUCKLES)
7093840 7096639 They got me down at the workhouse.
7096640 7099560 I thought I was being slick<br />cashing other people's checks.
7100680 7102633 How much time you doing?
7103280 7105839 They give me three years.
7105840 7109192 I got that beat now.<br />I ain't got but nine more months.
7114360 7116879 It ain't so bad.
7116880 7120039 You learn to deal with it<br />like anything else.
7122120 7124159 "You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights,"
7124160 7127439 that's what Papa used to say.
7127440 7131119 He used to say that when he struck out.
7131120 7133399 I seen him strike out<br />three times in a row,
7133400 7137719 and the next time up,<br />he hit the ball over the grandstand.
7137720 7140879 Right out there in Homestead Field.
7141320 7145309 He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.<br />He wanted to hit it over everything.
7146640 7148513 Then after the game,
7149880 7154597 he had 200 people standing around,<br />waiting to shake his hand.
7157800 7160595 You got to take the crookeds<br />with the straights.

7363120 7367077 They carried him down there to the<br />hospital, but I knew there wasn't no need.
7369440 7373190 - Why don't you come on in the house?<br />- Mama, I got something to tell you.
7374360 7377639 I don't know how to tell you this,<br />but I got to tell you.

7401360 7402959 I don't got to listen to that!
7402960 7405040 Now, I know you and your daddy<br />ain't seen eye to eye,
7405065 7408159 but I don't have to listen<br />to that kind of talk this morning.
7408160 7410839 Disrespecting your daddy<br />ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.
7410840 7412880 You gotta find some way<br />to come to that on your own.
7412905 7415574 Not going to your daddy's funeral<br />ain't gonna make you a man.
7418160 7421159 The whole time I was growing up,<br />living in his house,
7421160 7424273 Papa was like a shadow<br />that followed you everywhere.
7424840 7428272 It weighed on you,<br />and it sunk into your flesh.
7428760 7430799 It would wrap around you and lay there
7430800 7433359 until you couldn't tell<br />which one was you anymore.
7433360 7437599 That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!
7437600 7440110 Trying to crawl in.<br />Trying to live through you.
7440840 7445599 Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson<br />staring right back at me.
7445600 7448839 Hiding under the bed, in the closet.
7448840 7451959 I'm just saying I got to find a way<br />to get rid of that shadow, Mama.
7451960 7454279 You just like him.<br />You got him in you good.
7454280 7456680 - Don't tell me that, Mama.<br />- You Troy Maxson all over again.
7456705 7459420 I don't want to be Troy Maxson!
7460520 7462199 I just want to be me.
7462200 7465199 ROSE: You can't be nobody<br />but who you are, Cory.
7465200 7468472 That shadow wasn't nothing<br />but you growing into yourself.
7468480 7470761 You either got to grow into it,<br />or cut it down to fit you,
7470786 7472879 but that's all you got to make a life with.
7472880 7477074 That's all you got to measure yourself<br />against the world out there.
7477880 7480879 Your daddy wanted you to be<br />everything he wasn't,
7480880 7482479 and at the same time,
7482480 7485434 he wanted you to be everything he was.
7485560 7487359 Now, I don't know<br />if he was right or wrong,
7487360 7488559 but I do know
7488560 7491753 he meant to do more good<br />than he meant to do harm.
7493560 7496594 Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised,
7497160 7500637 and sometimes,<br />when he took me in his arms, he cut.
7507240 7509591 When I first met your daddy,
7510320 7511954 I thought,
7512000 7515272 "Here is a man<br />I can lay down with and make a baby."
7515760 7517519 (LAUGHS)
7518680 7521679 That's the first thing<br />I thought when I seen him.
7521680 7524190 I thought, "Rose Lee",
7524680 7526879 "here's a man you can open yourself up to"
7526880 7529276 "and be filled to bursting!"
7530600 7535439 "Here's a man that can<br />fill up all them empty spaces"
7535440 7538280 "you been tipping around the edges of."
7543360 7546439 When your daddy walked through the house,
7546440 7548313 he was just
7549280 7551836 so big.
7553360 7555233 He filled it up!
7557560 7560479 That was my first mistake.
7560480 7562990 Not to make him leave some room for me.
7563320 7565273 But (SNIFFLES)
7567400 7570069 I wanted a house I could sing in.
7571320 7574639 And that's what your daddy gave me.
7574640 7578914 I didn't know to keep up his strength,<br />I had to give up little pieces of mine.
7580560 7583999 I took on his life as mine<br />and mixed up the pieces,
7584000 7587193 so you couldn't hardly tell<br />which was which.
7589840 7593079 It was my choice. My life.
7593080 7596273 And I didn't have to live it like that,
7598160 7601715 but that's what life offered me in the way<br />of being a woman, and I took it.
7603680 7606599 I grabbed it with both hands.
7606600 7609872 And by the time<br />Raynell came into the house...
7611200 7612390 (EXHALES)
7614680 7619238 I didn't want to make my blessings<br />off of nobody's misfortune,
7620880 7624039 but I took on to Raynell like she was
7624040 7627392 all them babies I wanted and never had.
7629440 7632633 Like I'd been blessed<br />to relive a part of my life.
7634040 7635230 (SNIFFLES)
7635560 7638912 And if the Lord see fit<br />to keep up my strength,
7640800 7644994 I'm gonna do her exactly<br />how your daddy did you.
7648400 7651279 I'm gonna give her<br />the best of what's in me.
7651280 7652960 (PHONE RINGING)
7661160 7662319 RAYNELL: Mama!
7662320 7664591 Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

7755480 7758195 <i>Blue laid down and died like a man.</i>
7758320 7760637 <i>Blue laid down and died.</i>

7766160 7769194 <i>Now he's treeing possums<br />In the Promised Land.</i>
7769920 7772715 <i>I'm gonna tell you this<br />Just to let you know.</i>

7777200 7780711 <i>Blue's gone<br />Where the good dogs go.</i>
