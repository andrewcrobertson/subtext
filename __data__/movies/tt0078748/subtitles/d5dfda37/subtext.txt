409701 414623 <i>- The food is terrible.</i><br />- Worst shit I've ever seen, man.
414706 417167 <i>What you say?<br />You got any biscuits over there?</i>
417250 419586 <i>I keep seeing corn bread.</i>
422339 424799 - I am cold.<br />- Still with us, Brett?
426086 429262 - Right.<br /><i>- I feel dead.</i>
429346 432223 Anybody ever tell you<br />you look dead, man?
435986 437145 <i>Yeah, right.</i>
437228 439314 Now, I just forgot something, man.
439397 441358 Before we dock,
441441 443443 <i>I think we oughta discuss<br />the bonus situation.</i>
443568 445570 - Right.<br /><i>- Brett and I, we think we oughta—</i>
445654 448031 - We deserve full shares, right, baby?<br />- You see, Mr. Parker and I...
448114 451743 feel that the bonus situation has<br />never been on an equitable level.
451826 455080 Well, you'll get what you're<br />contracted for like everybody else.
455205 457540 Yes, but everybody else<br />gets more than us.
457624 459793 Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.
460758 463296 Yeah, I saw it.<br />Yellow light's for my eyes only.
464682 466475 Okay, get dressed, huh?
466600 470020 - Parker, come on.<br />- Can I finish my coffee? Thank you.
470104 472564 It's the only thing good on this ship.
526417 529086 <i>Morning, Mother.</i>
558699 561911 - Right.<br />- Okay.
561994 564288 Plug us in.
565539 567458 Thank you.
570920 574256 - Where's Earth?<br />- You should know.
574340 577510 It's not our system.
578131 579366 Scan.
582553 584233 I can't believe this.
584642 586468 Contact Traffic Control.

618873 622471 I found it.<br />Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.
622596 627077 <i>- We haven't reached the outer rim yet.</i><br />- That's hard to believe.
628143 630944 <i>What the hell are we doing out here?</i>
631843 635025 I don't know.<br />What the hell are you talking about?
635109 638529 - That's not our system.<br />- I know that.
639213 642700 Do you ever notice<br />how they never come down here?
642783 644910 I mean, this is where the work is, right?
644994 647663 Well, it's the same damn reason<br />we get a half share to their one.
647746 649832 Our time is their time.<br />That's the way they see it.
649915 651834 - No, but— Listen, man.<br />- Same old shit, man.
651917 654044 I think I know why they<br />don't come down here.
654128 656630 It's because of you.<br />You don't have no personality.
658632 661427 <i>Wonder what they want now.<br />What's going on down here?</i>
664728 667224 - You happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?<br />- Yes, of course.
667308 670227 - Thank you.<br />- I'm sorry.
674815 676817 <i>What's happenin' now, baby?</i>
678652 682865 Well, some of you may have<br />figured out we're not home yet.
682948 685326 - We're only halfway there.<br />- What?
685409 688787 Mother's interrupted<br />the course of our journey.
688871 690076 - Why?<br /><i>- Yeah.</i>
690201 693918 She's programmed to do that should<br />certain conditions arise. They have.
694043 696498 <i>- Like what?</i><br />- It seems she has...
697129 699340 intercepted a transmission<br />of unknown origin.
699465 702676 <i>- She got us up to check it out.</i><br />- A transmission? Out here?
702760 705512 <i>- Yeah.</i><br />- What kind of a transmission?
705596 709266 Acoustical beacon. It repeats<br />at intervals of 12 seconds.
709350 711226 - S.O.S.?<br />- I don't know.
711310 713228 Human?
713354 716190 - Unknown.<br /><i>- Well, so what?</i>
716273 718400 We are obligated under section eight—
718484 720778 I hate to bring this up, but...
720861 723197 this is a commercial ship,<br />not a rescue ship.
723322 724216 Right.
724241 726784 And it's not in my contract<br />to do this kind of duty.
726867 728628 And what about the money?<br />If you wanna give me some money,
728652 730398 I'll be happy to oblige.
730871 733165 - The man's right.<br />- Let's go over the bonus situation.
733248 737169 - I'm sorry. Can I say something?<br /><i>- Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>
737252 739880 There is a clause in the contract<br />which specifically states...
739964 743175 any systematized transmission<br />indicating a possible intelligent origin...
743258 744885 - must be investigated.<br />- I don't wanna hear it.
745010 747179 - We don't know if it's intelligent.<br />- I wanna go home and party.
747262 749556 Parker, will you<br />just listen to the man?
751767 756313 On penalty of total forfeiture<br />of shares. No money.
757648 759233 You got that?
760386 763070 - Well, yeah.<br />- All right, we're going in.
763153 765072 Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?
772414 774711 - Can we all hear that,<br />- Lambert?
797226 798522 Good God.
798605 801025 Doesn't sound like any<br />radio signal I've heard.
801108 803277 - Maybe it's a voice.<br />- Well, we'll soon know.
803360 805446 Can you hone in on that?
806572 809283 What was the position?
809366 813162 6550-99.
819286 820836 - All right.<br />- It found the quadrant.
821708 824512 <i>Ascension: six minutes, 20 seconds.</i>
824715 829239 <i>Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds.</i>
829411 831680 Okay. Put that on the screen for me.
836226 838062 <i>All right. Well, that's it.</i>
838145 841565 It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometers.
841648 844193 - It's tiny.<br />- Any rotation?
846653 849073 <i>About two hours.</i>
849156 851492 What about gravity?
851575 853911 Point eight-six.

1023538 1025916 What the hell was that?
1025999 1028502 Pressure drop in intake three.<br />Must've lost a shield.
1028585 1030295 Let's go with it.
1039770 1041843 Dropping off now.
1042442 1044559 <i>Still dropping.</i>
1045808 1047768 Here we are. We've got it.
1048614 1051108 Take her down.

1125098 1127100 What the hell happened?
1130004 1131695 Somebody give me a straight answer!
1131780 1132672 Is the hull breached?
1133254 1135825 I don't see anything.<br />We've still got pressure.
1136301 1139488 - Hit the screen.<br />- Right.
1146453 1150499 <i>Secondary load sharing unit...</i>
1150582 1152501 <i>is out.</i>
1152584 1155712 <i>Three to four cells are gone.</i>

1161259 1164554 <i>We can't fix it out here anyway,<br />and we need to reroute...</i>

1168577 1170602 Dry dock.<br />Tell her we need to dry-dock.
1170685 1172604 Look, we couldn't fix it<br />out here anyway.
1172687 1174606 We gotta reroute all these ducts,
1174689 1177317 and in order to do that<br />we've got to dry-dock.
1178307 1179653 What else?
1179736 1181655 <i>Some fragments kicked up,</i>
1181738 1184074 <i>and we've got to clean it<br />all out and repressurize it.</i>
1184566 1186618 <i>How long before we're functional?</i>
1186701 1190370 - Look, what is— What—<br />- It's 17 hours, tell her.
1191248 1194000 - At least 25 hours.<br />- Yeah.
1194084 1196503 Get started on the floor panel.<br />I'll be right down.
1196586 1198630 What the hell's<br />she comin' down here for?
1198713 1200715 She better stay the fuck<br />out of my way, I'll tell you that.
1200799 1203552 I'd like to see what she's<br />gonna do when she gets here.
1213603 1217315 - Any response yet?<br /><i>- No. Absolutely nothing.</i>
1217399 1220569 <i>Except the same transmission<br />every 12 seconds.</i>
1220652 1222654 <i>All the other channels are dead.</i>

1245427 1247427 We can't go anywhere in this.
1249347 1251641 Well, Mother says the sun's<br />coming up in 20 minutes.
1251766 1253766 How far are we from<br />the source of transmission?
1253875 1255103 Northeast.
1255187 1257606 Just under 2,000 meters.
1257689 1259297 Walking distance?
1260734 1262180 Well—
1262944 1266031 - Can you give me an atmospheric?<br />- Yes.
1272412 1274498 It's almost primordial.
1274581 1276625 <i>There's inert nitrogen,</i>
1276708 1279377 high concentration of carbon<br />dioxide crystals, methane.
1279461 1281379 I'm working on the trace elements.
1281463 1283590 - Anything else?<br />- Yes.
1283673 1285592 It's...
1285675 1288053 rock, lava base,
1288136 1290055 and deep cold.
1290138 1292028 <i>Well below the line.</i>
1294142 1296811 I'll volunteer to be in<br />the first group to go out.
1296895 1298505 <i>Yeah, that figures.</i>
1299731 1301481 <i>You too, Lambert.</i>
1302651 1306154 - Swell.<br />- Better break out the weapons.
1379978 1383148 I can't see a goddamn thing.
1384649 1386610 Ash, are you receiving?
1391448 1393742 <i>Good contact on my board.</i>
1393825 1398079 <i>Clear and free.<br />Keep the line open. Let's go.</i>
1412427 1415263 Hey, Ripley.
1415347 1417307 Hey, Ripley,<br />I wanna ask you a question.
1419809 1422604 If they find what they're lookin' for out<br />there, does that mean we get full shares?
1422687 1426941 Don't worry, Parker. You'll<br />get whatever's coming to you.
1427025 1429569 Look, I'm not gonna do<br />any more work...
1429653 1431344 till we get this<br />straightened out.
1431368 1432572 <i>Brett,</i>
1432697 1435505 you're guaranteed by law<br />to get a share.
1435732 1436754 <i>What?</i>
1436817 1439496 - Why don't you just fuck off.<br />- What?
1440309 1442040 <i>What'd you say, Rip?</i>
1442123 1445627 If you have any trouble,<br />I'll be on the bridge.
1447212 1449881 <i>Hey, Ripley, come back here!</i>
1454886 1457889 - Son of a bitch.<br />- What's the matter?
1467899 1470610 Can't see a goddamn thing.
1470694 1473446 Quit griping. I like griping.
1473530 1475573 Come on. Knock it off.
1487678 1489850 How's it going?
1491171 1492124 All right.
1492171 1495096 Have you tried putting that<br />transmission through E.C.I.U.?
1495179 1498266 <i>No. Mother hasn't identified it yet.</i>
1498349 1500685 - You mind if I give it a shot?<br /><i>- Please do.</i>
1576850 1579269 Ash, can you see this?
1579352 1581563 Yes, I can.
1584691 1586651 I've never seen anything like it.
1595619 1598079 Very bizarre.
1601374 1603376 You said it.
1612093 1614471 All right.
1614554 1617057 Moving on to second... position.
1617140 1619768 What is it?
1621853 1623563 Let's get out of here.
1623647 1626316 We've got this far. We must go on.
1626399 1628360 We have to go on.
1631613 1635242 Will you say that again? Shit.
1636743 1640539 Ash, as you can see,<br />it's kind of hard to describe.
1640622 1643333 I'm going back to the console.
1658223 1660475 Seems to be solid.
1660559 1663144 To walk— You can on it.
1695904 1698949 Dallas?
1702869 1704246 Dallas?
1757267 1759477 Come on down here.<br />Something different down here.
1760937 1763356 I don't know what it is, but—
1763440 1766818 See if we can get up that wall. If we<br />can get up that wall, we can find out.
1833977 1835979 Amazing.
1838189 1840566 Alien life-form.
1841901 1844904 Looks like it's been dead a long time.
1844988 1847657 Fossilized.
1847740 1850702 Looks like it's grown out of the chair.
1866428 1868555 Bones are bent outward,
1868638 1871725 like he exploded from inside.
1876354 1879190 <i>Wonder what happened<br />to the rest of the crew.</i>
1883069 1886656 Let's get the hell out of here.
1898293 1900754 Hey, Dallas, Lambert,<br />come on over here.
1904549 1906557 Come on.
1913564 1916609 - What do you got?<br /><i>- See what you make of this.</i>
1925100 1926207 Ash.
1926290 1929710 <i>That transmission—<br />Mother's deciphered part of it.</i>
1929794 1932254 <i>- It doesn't look like an S.O.S.</i><br />- What is it, then?
1932338 1934598 Well, I—<br />It looks like a warning.
1935758 1938344 <i>- I'm gonna go out after them.</i><br />- What's the point?
1941305 1944433 I mean, by the time it takes<br />to get there, you'll—
1944517 1946977 <i>they'll know if it's<br />a warning or not, yes?</i>
1974046 1976090 <i>You okay down there?</i>
1980386 1983347 <i>- Can you see anything?</i><br />- A cave.
1984640 1987601 A ca— A cave of some sort.<br />But I—
1989770 1992565 Well, I don't know, but it's like<br />the goddamn tropics in here.
1994902 1998030 What the hell is this?
2034233 2037195 The cave is completely enclosed,
2037278 2039655 and it's full of...
2039739 2043576 leathery objects,<br />like eggs or something.
2061706 2063808 There's a layer of mist...
2063891 2067937 Just covering the eggs<br />that reacts when broken.
2071106 2074068 <i>Kane? You all right?</i>
2074151 2076695 I'm okay. All right.
2078906 2081075 I'm okay. I just slipped.
2101470 2104181 Appears to be completely sealed.
2138345 2140651 <i>Wait a minute.<br />There's movement.</i>
2146042 2149796 <i>It seems to have life.<br />Organic life.</i>
2214194 2216613 <i>- You there, Ripley?</i><br />- I'm right here.
2223328 2226247 - Okay, Ripley, I'm at the inner lock hatch now.<br /><i>- Right.</i>
2236105 2237550 - Ripley.<br /><i>- Right here.</i>
2237636 2238843 We're clean. Let us in.
2238927 2241355 - What happened to Kane?<br />- Something has attached itself to him.
2241394 2243672 We have to get him<br />to the infirmary right away.
2243696 2245308 What kind of thing?
2245391 2247644 <i>- I need a clear definition.</i><br />- An organism. Open the hatch.
2247727 2250188 Wait a minute. If we let it in,<br />the ship could be infected.
2250271 2254067 You know the quarantine procedure—<br />24 hours for decontamination.
2254150 2256027 He could die in 24 hours.<br />Open the hatch.
2256110 2258947 Listen to me. If we break<br />quarantine, we could all die.
2259030 2263368 Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?<br />We have to get him inside.
2264786 2266955 No. I can't do that.
2267038 2269457 <i>And if you were in my position,<br />you'd do the same.</i>
2269541 2271459 Ripley, this is an order.<br />Open that hatch right now.
2271543 2273419 - Do you hear me?<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
2273503 2275547 <i>Ripley, this is an order!<br />Do you hear me?</i>
2275630 2279384 Yes, I read you.<br />The answer is negative.
2281511 2283471 Inner hatch opened.
2310123 2313167 My God.
2323303 2325388 What the hell is that?
2326681 2330059 Jesus Christ.
2332020 2334314 What is that, man?
2336107 2338443 Hey, how the hell is he breathing?
2338526 2340445 Is he still alive or what?
2340528 2343489 Why don't you guys freeze him?
2343573 2345575 How come they don't freeze him?
2345658 2347619 What's going on in there?
2347702 2350038 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- You bitch!
2350121 2352582 - Jesus Christ!<br />- Hey! Hey!
2352665 2354918 - You would've left us out there.<br />- Break it up.
2355001 2359505 <i>Ripley, when I give an order,<br />I expect to be obeyed.</i>
2359589 2363092 - Even if it's against the law?<br /><i>- You're goddamn right!</i>
2363176 2365970 Maybe she has a point.<br />Who the hell knows what that thing is.
2366054 2368848 How are we gonna get that off him?
2368973 2372393 - How are we gonna get it off?<br />- I'm gonna get some instruments.
2375778 2377488 How is he?
2383378 2385297 My God.
2386053 2389807 Right. I'll make an incision here.
2389932 2395354 - Try and remove one of the digitals from—<br />- You're gonna do what?
2395437 2398524 Finger. I'm gonna try and<br />get his finger off. Just a minute.
2403821 2407449 <i>No, that's not— It's tearing<br />his scalp. I know!</i>
2407533 2411829 It's not coming off without<br />tearing his face off with it.
2412279 2414865 We'll have to take a<br />look at him inside. Right.
2417293 2420045 How come they don't freeze him?
2420129 2423048 <i>How come you guys<br />don't freeze him?</i>
2438689 2441150 All right, you can take your mask off.
2459627 2465549 - What's it got down his throat?<br /><i>- I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.</i>
2465633 2470179 Paralyzes him, puts him in<br />a coma, then keeps him alive.
2470262 2473098 <i>Now what the hell is that?</i>
2473224 2475142 - We gotta get it off of him.<br />- Just a minute.
2475226 2477144 Just a minute.
2477228 2479688 I mean, let's not be too hasty.
2479772 2481941 We don't know anything<br />about...
2482024 2483310 <i>it.</i>
2483583 2485181 <i>Now, we're assuming it's<br />feeding him oxygen.</i>
2485205 2487271 If we remove it
2488530 2490532 it could kill him.
2493118 2495287 I'm willing to take that chance.<br />Let's cut it off him now.
2495412 2499124 - You'll take responsibility?<br />- Yes, I'll take responsibility. Get him out of there.
2500876 2503003 <i>Where do you wanna do this?</i>
2503087 2506257 We'll make an incision<br />just below the knuckle there.
2506340 2507967 - Right here.<br /><i>- Stand by.</i>
2516809 2518811 <i>Good God!</i>
2522189 2525484 <i>That crap's gonna eat through the hull.</i>
2527444 2529738 That thing's gonna eat through<br />the goddamn hull. Come on!
2529822 2532366 What's going on?
2532449 2534451 This way.
2542543 2544628 <i>Next deck.</i>
2562313 2564064 <i>There it is.</i>
2565816 2567776 Don't get under it!<br />Don't get under it.
2573615 2575617 Looks like it's stopping.
2578495 2580414 - Take a look at this, man.<br />- Yeah.
2580489 2584035 Brett, give me— What do you got,<br />a pen there? Give it to me, quick.
2584126 2586295 Come on! Come on!
2590674 2592593 <i>Don't get any on your arm.</i>
2599641 2602644 It stopped.
2602728 2606774 Don't see anything like that<br />except molecular acid.
2606857 2609943 It must be using it for blood.
2610027 2611945 It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
2612029 2614239 <i>You don't dare kill it.</i>
2614323 2616200 What about Kane?
2618160 2621622 - Here's your pen back.<br /><i>- What do we do now?</i>
2621705 2624833 Leave Kane to Ash.<br />You get back to work.
2627044 2628962 Well, what—
2637304 2640224 Okay.
2640307 2641728 Try it.
2647231 2649274 Damn it.<br />I thought sure that was it.
2649358 2650986 Try it again.
2652369 2655280 I feel like I've been<br />in this place a month.
2656782 2659326 We shouldn't have landed in<br />this place in the first place.
2661036 2665290 Shouldn't have landed on<br />this damn ball, I know that.
2665374 2668279 Well, the sooner we patch this<br />thing up and get out of here,
2668772 2670022 the sooner we can go home.
2670062 2671686 This place gives me the creeps.
2735235 2737779 <i>That's amazing. What is it?</i>
2739440 2740987 Yes, it is.
2742618 2744745 I don't know yet.
2748916 2750417 Did you want something?
2750501 2752794 Yes. I—
2754588 2757508 I'd like to have a little talk.<br />How's— How's Kane?
2757591 2759463 He's holding. No changes.
2760072 2763634 And our guest?
2765015 2766392 Well—
2768018 2769895 Well, as I said, I'm still...
2769978 2771939 collating, actually, but...
2772022 2776068 I have confirmed that he's got an<br />outer layer of protein polysaccharides.
2777819 2780113 He has a funny habit<br />of shedding his cells...
2780197 2784034 and replacing them with...<br />polarized silicon,
2784117 2786245 which gives him<br />a prolonged resistance...
2786328 2790249 to adverse<br />environmental conditions.
2790374 2792376 - Is that enough for you?<br />- That's plenty.
2792501 2795754 - What does it mean?<br />- Please don't do that. Thank you.
2795837 2798882 I'm sorry.
2798966 2800884 Well, it's an interesting<br />combination of elements,
2800968 2805514 making him<br />a tough little son of a bitch.
2805597 2807975 And you let him in.
2808058 2810435 I was obeying<br />a direct order, remember?
2810519 2814606 Ash, when Dallas and Kane<br />are off the ship,
2814690 2816225 I'm senior officer.
2816858 2818412 <i>Yes. I forgot.</i>
2819820 2823282 You also forgot the science<br />division's basic quarantine law.
2823811 2825534 - No, that I didn't forget.<br />- Oh, I see.
2825617 2827459 You just broke it.
2828378 2830201 Look, what would you<br />have done with Kane?
2832082 2835377 You knew his only chance of survival<br />was to get him in here.
2835460 2837879 Unfortunately,<br />by breaking quarantine,
2837963 2839923 you risk everybody's life.
2840007 2843093 Maybe I should've left him outside.
2843176 2847014 Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,<br />but it was a risk I was willing to take.
2847097 2849266 That's a pretty big risk...
2849349 2851268 for a science officer.
2851351 2854730 It's not exactly<br />out of the manual, is it?
2856148 2859568 I do take my responsibilities<br />as seriously as you, you know.
2860736 2862654 <i>You do your job...</i>
2862738 2864823 and let me do mine, yes?
2900455 2904793 <i>- Where's Dallas?<br />- In the shuttle.</i>
2909881 2912467 - Dallas.<br /><i>- I think you should have a look at Kane.</i>
2913076 2916554 - Why?<br /><i>- Something's happened.</i>
2916680 2919683 - Serious?<br /><i>- Interesting.</i>
2924229 2926147 Ripley, meet me<br />in the infirmary right away.
2930318 2932279 <i>Where is it?</i>
2932362 2935198 <i>Well, I don't know. I mean,<br />we ought to try and find it.</i>
2935282 2937200 <i>Yeah, let's check it.</i>
2963852 2966146 Dallas, please be careful.
3007187 3009522 Sorry.
3041388 3045558 No, not in the corner.<br />Have one of these.
3047185 3049104 <i>Just in case.</i>
3061533 3065036 Kane? Dallas?
3069165 3070347 You okay?
3070641 3072335 I didn't see it.<br />Was it in the overhead?
3072451 3076172 - What? It was up there somewhere.<br />- My God.
3076610 3079467 <i>- Cover up the damn thing!<br />- Wait.</i>
3079551 3082053 That's alive!
3082137 3084139 That's a reflex action.
3086259 3087899 Well, we've gotta<br />have a look at this.
3099863 3102031 Excuse me.
3108663 3111416 - Seems dead enough.<br /><i>- Well, good. Let's get rid of it.</i>
3112959 3115462 Ripley, for God's sake,
3115545 3118965 this is the first time that we've<br />encountered a species like this.
3119048 3121593 <i>It has to go back.<br />All sorts of tests have to be made.</i>
3121676 3124137 Ash, are you kidding?<br />This thing bled acid.
3124220 3126973 Who knows what it's<br />gonna do when it's dead.
3127056 3130268 Think it's safe to assume<br />it isn't a zombie.
3130351 3133021 Dallas, it has to go back.
3133104 3135607 Well, I'd soon...
3135690 3138193 as not burn it at the stake,<br />but you're the science officer.
3138276 3139611 - It's your decision, Ash.<br />- Dallas.
3140998 3143333 How come I've got to change my mind?<br />The decision's been made.
3143417 3145836 I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.<br />I just want you to listen—
3145919 3147838 Will you listen to—
3150215 3152468 <i>Just tell me how you can<br />leave that kind of decision to him.</i>
3152551 3154553 Look, I just run the ship.
3154636 3157139 Anything that has to do with the<br />science division, Ash has the final word.
3157222 3158226 How does that happen?
3158250 3160517 It happens, my dear, because that's<br />what the company wants to happen.
3160878 3163206 Since when is that<br />standard procedure?
3163402 3166071 Standard procedure is to do<br />what the hell they tell you to do.
3166675 3168240 Did you ever ship out<br />with Ash before?
3168324 3171577 I went out five times<br />with another science officer.
3171660 3175081 They replaced him two days<br />before we left Thedus with Ash.
3175748 3180169 - I don't trust him.<br />- I don't trust anybody.
3180295 3182152 <i>What's happening with<br />the repairs? How's it going?</i>
3182177 3184049 They're pretty much finished now.
3184132 3186051 Why the hell didn't you tell me so?
3186134 3187716 Because there's still<br />some things left to do.
3187740 3188720 Like what?
3188803 3191186 <i>Well, we're blind<br />on "B" and "C" decks.</i>
3191311 3194148 <i>- The reserve power system's blown—</i><br />- That's a bunch of horseshit.
3194273 3197401 - We can take off without that.<br /><i>- Yeah, we can. You think that's a good idea?</i>
3197484 3200362 Look, I just wanna get<br />the hell out of here, all right?
3224553 3227181 Dust in the intakes again.<br />Number two's overheating.
3227264 3229558 Spit on it for two minutes,<br />would you, for Christ's sake?
3231059 3233395 <i>We're hot.<br />We're getting hotter.</i>
3236148 3239777 <i>Engine room, red clip status?</i>
3239902 3243864 - One kilometer on ascension.<br /><i>- Engage artificial gravity.</i>
3243947 3247493 <i>- Engaged.</i><br />- I'm altering the vector now.
3251872 3253874 <i>Inhibit C.N.G. control.</i>
3257434 3260114 - Struts retract.<br /><i>- Struts retracted.</i>
3261882 3264247 <i>Max stress to fifth overload.</i>
3266094 3268555 <i>Ease it back.</i>
3269681 3271683 <i>She's great. Beautiful.</i>
3283195 3286323 Walk in the park. When we<br />fix something, we stay fixed.
3286406 3289201 <i>- Don't we, Brett baby?<br />- Right.</i>
3304550 3306510 <i>What I think we should do<br />is just freeze him.</i>
3306600 3308662 <i>If he's got a disease,<br />why don't we stop it where it is?</i>
3308780 3310433 He can always get to a doctor<br />when we get back home.
3310457 3311929 Right.
3312297 3316009 Whenever he says anything,<br />you say "right," Brett. You know that?
3316436 3317678 Right.
3318357 3321419 Parker, what do you think? Your staff<br />just follows you around, says "right."
3321482 3324069 - Just like a regular parrot.<br />- Yeah. Shape up.
3324152 3326317 - What are you, some kind of parrot?<br />- Right.
3326403 3328212 Come on. Knock it off!
3328567 3330242 Kane's gonna have to<br />go into quarantine.
3330325 3333120 - That's it.<br />- Yes, and so will we.
3333203 3335455 Well, how about a little<br />something to lower your spirits?
3335539 3337296 Thrill me, will you, please?
3337708 3339304 Well, according to my calculations,
3339413 3341628 based on time spent getting<br />to and from the planet—
3341753 3344183 Just give me the short version.<br />How far to Earth?
3344413 3345804 - Ten months.<br />- Oh, God.
3345996 3347499 Great.
3348298 3349263 Yes.
3349344 3350977 <i>Dallas, I think<br />you should come and see Kane.</i>
3351266 3352770 Has his condition changed?
3352794 3354391 <i>It's simpler if you'd just<br />come and see him.</i>
3354577 3356501 We're on our way.
3358061 3359485 Right.
3363108 3365485 <i>How are you doing?</i>
3367863 3370532 - Thank you.<br />- How you doin'?
3371241 3372826 Terrific.<br />Next silly question.
3376491 3378457 Thank you.
3380500 3383128 Do you remember anything<br />about the planet?
3386048 3388467 What's the last thing<br />you do remember?
3395390 3397309 I remember some...
3397392 3400062 horrible dream about... smothering.
3400145 3401939 <i>And—</i>
3402022 3404524 And— Anyway, where are we?
3404650 3406985 - Right here.<br />- We're on our way home.
3407069 3409154 Back to the old freezerinos.
3411323 3413492 Could I have something to eat<br />before we go back?
3413575 3415410 I-I need something myself.
3415485 3419155 Yeah, right. One more meal<br />before bedtime. I'm buyin'.
3419247 3422292 - Hey, that's a break.<br /><i>- Bedtime.</i>
3442062 3444606 The first thing that I'm<br />gonna do when I get back...
3444690 3446692 is to get some decent food.
3446775 3449486 I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,<br />I've eaten worse food than this,
3449611 3452280 - but then I've tasted better, you know what I'm sayin'?<br />- The other one over there.
3452364 3455450 Well, you pound down the<br />stuff like there's no tomorrow.
3455534 3458829 I'd rather be eatin' something<br />else, but right now I'm thinkin' food.
3458912 3462833 Well, you should know.<br />You know what it's made of.
3462916 3465961 No, man, I don't wanna talk<br />about what it's made of.
3466086 3468005 I'm eatin' this just to—
3469423 3470718 What's the matter?
3470789 3473677 - The food ain't that bad, baby.<br />- What's wrong, Kane?
3474484 3476421 <i>- Are you choking?</i><br />- What's wrong?
3479550 3481601 What? What?
3481685 3484730 - This is serious.<br />- Kane, what's the matter?
3486846 3488628 Its okay!
3488761 3492529 - Hold him down!<br />- Hold him—
3492612 3494740 <i>Get the spoon in!</i>
3497049 3498158 Damn it!
3498291 3500787 - Get it into his mouth!<br />- I'm trying!
3528648 3532527 <i>Oh, my God! Oh, God!</i>
3540660 3542704 <i>- No!</i><br />- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
3559304 3561473 <i>Dallas?</i>
3561562 3564151 <i>- Dallas?<br />- Yeah.</i>
3564234 3568071 <i>- Anything?<br />- No. You?</i>
3568155 3570532 <i>Nothing.</i>
3570616 3573201 <i>- You see anything?<br />- No.</i>
3608019 3609448 <i>Inner hatch sealed.</i>
3613394 3615671 <i>Anybody wanna say anything?</i>
3652166 3655628 This is just an ordinary prod,<br />like a cattle prod.
3655711 3657630 It's got a portable battery.
3657713 3660425 It's insulated all the way here,<br />all the way up to here.
3660508 3663469 Just make damn sure nobody<br />puts their hand on the end of it.
3667014 3668933 <i>It shouldn't damage the little bastard,</i>
3669016 3671519 unless its skin's thinner than ours.
3671602 3675773 But it will give him<br />a little incentive.
3675857 3677900 Now we just have to find it.
3677984 3681779 I've taken care of that.<br />I've designed this tracking device.
3681863 3686284 You just set it to search for<br />a moving object, like so.
3686367 3688870 <i>Hasn't got much of a range, but<br />when you get within a certain distance,</i>
3688953 3690997 <i>it'll start to give off a signal.</i>
3691080 3694167 What's it key on?
3694250 3698004 Micro changes in air density.
3698087 3700465 Give me a demo.
3702578 3704937 See? Again.
3705887 3707343 Got ya.
3708125 3712281 Two teams.<br />Ash, Lambert and I.
3712437 3715313 Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.
3715396 3717899 Now, anyone see this thing,<br />you catch it in the net...
3717982 3720109 that Parker's holding on his lap.
3720193 3723112 Parker, I don't want any<br />heroics out of you, all right?
3723196 3726616 <i>Catch it put it in the<br />air lock, get rid of it.</i>
3726699 3728618 <i>Now, channels are open<br />on all decks.</i>
3728701 3732788 I want you to communicate,<br />keep in touch at all times, all right?
3732872 3734874 Let's go.
3748557 3751102 I thought you fixed 12 module.
3751185 3753562 We did.
3753646 3755689 I don't understand it.
3757566 3759860 The circuits must have burned out.
3772638 3773549 What do we got here?
3773573 3775626 Damn it! Hold your light<br />over here, would you?
3775709 3777076 Yeah, that's it.
3777711 3781634 I don't know if this is gonna work.
3781717 3784345 If I could just put this—<br />put this in there.
3784428 3787223 <i>- Right.</i><br />- Oh, damn it.
3790393 3792478 <i>Check the insulation.</i>
3792562 3794897 Oh, shit!
3817057 3820599 - Steady.<br /><i>- According to this, it's within five meters.</i>
3821956 3823935 <i>Open the door.</i>
3828198 3831401 <i>Micro changes in air density, my ass.</i>
3836573 3838841 It's within five meters.
3839028 3840952 <i>Be careful.</i>
3870148 3871064 <i>Christ.</i>
3871088 3872651 <i>Don't do that.<br />Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>
3872734 3875487 <i>You guys, stick together.</i>
3891099 3894811 - Don't fail me now.<br />- What?
3894936 3897105 - What is it?<br />- Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
3897188 3899107 Where?
3899190 3901192 Here, take this.
3901276 3903695 Get over there and get the net.
3903820 3906406 - Get it?<br />- I got it. I got it. I got it.
3906489 3909075 Wait a minute.<br />Wait a minute.
3910827 3913872 All right, Parker.<br />When I say.
3914873 3917459 All right. Now.
3917542 3919544 Easy.
3924089 3925768 Wait! Don't let him go!
3925823 3927674 What the hell are you doing, man?
3927828 3929747 It's the cat.
3936603 3939481 Hey, look, now.<br />We had to bag it, man.
3939564 3942775 Now we might pick it up<br />on the tracker again.
3942901 3945153 - I'll— I'll— I'll—<br />- Go and get it, man.
3946154 3948031 All right. You get him.<br />We'll go on.
3959584 3962003 Here, kitty!
3962086 3964464 Here, kitty, kitty!
3964547 3967175 Enough of that kitty crap.
3967258 3971179 Jones.
3971262 3973181 Jonesy?
3973264 3975266 Here, Jonesy.
3983024 3984943 <i>Jonesy?</i>
3990114 3992450 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
3998957 4001334 Here, Jonesy.
4013137 4015014 Jonesy?
4026276 4028444 Here, kitty, kitty.
4115657 4118242 Kitty, kitty, kitty.
4119994 4122330 Here, Jonesy.
4122413 4124415 Jonesy.
4126668 4128670 Kitty, kitty.
4183449 4185660 Kitty, kitty, kitty.
4189710 4191712 Jonesy?
4198427 4201263 Hey. Hey.<br />Come on, Jonesy.
4201346 4203640 Come on, baby.<br />That's a kitty.
4203724 4207102 <i>That's a kitty.<br />Come on, baby.</i>
4207185 4208841 That's a kitty.
4210497 4213708 Hey, hey.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you.
4213733 4215735 <i>Come on.</i>
4245824 4247742 Brett!
4247826 4250161 <i>Brett!</i>
4257460 4260046 <i>Brett!</i>
4268771 4271607 Whatever it was, it was—<br />it was big and—
4275027 4277363 You're sure it took him<br />into the air shaft?
4277446 4279573 Disappeared into<br />one of the cooling ducts.
4279657 4281992 No question, it's—<br />it's using the air ducts to move around.
4286128 4288297 Could he want Brett alive?
4289631 4292301 - What?<br />- Could Brett be alive?
4292384 4295054 No. I mean, I don't think so.
4295137 4299058 Well, this air shaft may<br />work to our advantage.
4299141 4303937 Here it leads up to and comes<br />out in the main air lock.
4304021 4306315 All right. There's only one<br />big opening along the way.
4306398 4309735 We can cover that up, and then we...
4309818 4312321 drive it into the air lock<br />and zap it into outer space.
4312404 4314782 This son of a bitch is huge!
4314865 4318202 <i>- I mean, it's like a man. It's big!</i><br />- Kane's son.
4320662 4323123 <i>Come on, Ash. Science department<br />should be able to help us.</i>
4323207 4325584 What can we do to drive it?
4325667 4327961 Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably<br />well to our atmosphere,
4328045 4329653 considering its nutritional requirements.
4329700 4331407 The only thing we don't<br />know about is temperature.
4331431 4332755 Okay. What about temperature?
4332780 4334403 - What happens if we change it?<br />- Let's try it.
4335184 4337871 I mean, most animals<br />retreat from fire. Yes?
4338696 4341293 Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig...
4341692 4344103 <i>three or four incinerator units?</i>
4344186 4346772 Give me about 20 minutes.<br />I'll do it.
4347348 4349528 - Who gets to go into the vent?<br />- I do.
4351237 4354991 No. You and Ash...
4355074 4357285 take the main air lock.
4357368 4361539 Parker, Lambert, you cover up that<br />maintenance opening, please.
4361623 4363583 <i>Right.</i>
4460311 4463856 - I'm at the first junction.<br />- Dallas, I'm right here.
4463939 4465888 <i>- Parker?</i><br />- Yeah?
4465912 4467134 <i>Lambert?</i>
4467189 4470112 We're in position. I'm just<br />trying to get a reading here.
4470195 4472948 - The air lock is open.<br /><i>- Okay, Ripley.</i>
4473493 4475701 Ready.
4485044 4487796 All right. I've got a reading on you now.
4524883 4528220 <i>Open the hatch<br />to the third junction.</i>
4544117 4545828 <i>Okay, I'm through.</i>
4546258 4547789 <i>- Ripley?</i><br />- Yes.
4548071 4550391 <i>Close all the hatches behind me.</i>
4551135 4553304 <i>I'm moving on.</i>
4567996 4570645 <i>Dallas, hold it a minute.<br />I think I got it.</i>
4571738 4573691 - Yes, I've got it.<br /><i>- Where?</i>
4575168 4577738 <i>It's somewhere around the third junction.</i>
4578764 4580766 Okay, moving on.
4600675 4604220 <i>It is right around there. Now, Dallas,<br />you're gonna have to be careful.</i>
4614397 4619569 All right. I've reached...
4619652 4623489 the third junction, and I'm going down.
4640590 4643926 The hell's the matter with that box?
4644010 4647805 Dallas, you're gonna have to hold<br />your position for a minute. I—
4647889 4649932 <i>I've lost the signal.</i>
4650016 4652935 <i>What? You sure?</i>
4653019 4657106 <i>Look around. Are you sure it's not there?<br />It's got to be around there somewhere.</i>
4661277 4665156 Checked it out, Lambert.<br />You may be getting interference.
4665239 4667075 Dallas, are you sure there's no sign of it?
4667158 4671871 <i>I mean, it is there.<br />It's gotta be around there.</i>
4673581 4678669 - Dallas?<br />- God, what is happening?
4678753 4681506 All right.
4687222 4690014 Am I- am I clear, Lambert?<br />I want to get the hell out of here.
4691543 4694527 Oh, God. It's moving right towards you.
4702985 4707281 Move! Get out of there!<br />Behind you! Move!
4707365 4710493 <i>Dallas! Move, Dallas!<br />Move, Dallas!</i>
4710576 4712779 <i>Get out! Move!</i>
4714330 4715957 <i>The other way!</i>
4718013 4719710 Dallas?
4719794 4721546 - Oh, no.<br />- Take it easy.
4721629 4723756 Dallas?
4729262 4731430 We found this laying there.
4733099 4735351 No blood.
4735434 4738813 No Dallas. Nothing.
4744486 4745919 <i>How come I don't hear<br />nobody saying nothing?</i>
4745943 4747267 I'm thinking.
4750658 4755204 Unless somebody has got<br />a better idea,
4755288 4757540 we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.
4757630 4761384 What? And end up like the others?
4761835 4763483 No, you're out of your mind.
4763538 4767420 - Got a better idea?<br />- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
4767874 4770171 We get the shuttle and just<br />get the hell out of here.
4770196 4773598 We take our chances<br />and just hope that...
4773681 4775558 <i>- somebody picks us up.</i><br />- Lambert.
4775683 4779395 - The shuttle won't take four.<br /><i>- Then why don't we draw straws and—</i>
4779478 4782309 I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for<br />killing that goddamn thing right now.
4782692 4783895 <i>Okay.</i>
4784481 4786207 Well, let's talk about killing it.
4786324 4789692 We know it's using the air shafts—<br />Will you listen to me, Parker?
4789874 4792254 - Shut up!<br />- Let's hear it.
4793246 4794434 Let's hear it.
4794699 4796895 It's using the air shafts.
4797911 4800664 - We don't know that.<br />- That's the only way.
4801209 4804295 We'll move in pairs.<br />We'll go step by step...
4804386 4806740 <i>and cut off every bulkhead<br />and every vent...</i>
4806834 4810185 until we have it cornered, and then<br />we'll blow it the fuck out into space.
4810382 4812551 Is that acceptable to you?
4813012 4816918 - If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.<br />- Obviously it means killing it.
4818184 4820927 But we have to stick together.
4821361 4824367 <i>- How are our weapons?</i><br />- The weapons are fine.
4824602 4827969 - This one needs refueling.<br /><i>- Will you get it, please?</i>
4828903 4831899 - Ash, go with him.<br />- No, no. I can manage, Ash.
4832700 4834702 Don't follow me.
4838193 4840195 Ash?
4841409 4843912 Any suggestions from you or Mother?
4845879 4848286 No, we're still collating.
4850005 4851677 You're what?
4852215 4854426 You're still collating?
4855146 4857890 I find that hard to believe.
4859934 4863104 - What would you like me to do?<br />- Just what you've been doing, Ash.
4863187 4866148 Nothing.<br />I've got access to Mother now,
4866232 4869193 and I'll get my own answers, thank you.
4871821 4874365 All right.
4991289 4994584 There is an explanation<br />for this, you know.
4994668 4998672 Is there really? I don't wanna hear<br />your goddamn explanation!
4999548 5002676 I want— I want—
5005205 5009692 <i>I want— I w—</i>
5022621 5025708 Parker. Lambert?
5033966 5037394 Ash, open the door.
5047029 5049031 Ash—
5052951 5054912 <i>Will you open the door?</i>
5058391 5060704 Let me by, Ash.
5141874 5144334 The hell are you doing?
5162482 5164107 Get her up. Get her up.<br />Get her up. Get her up.
5177326 5179661 Android! He's an android!
5194468 5196470 Jesus!
5199681 5202935 <i>It's a robot.<br />Ash is a goddamn robot!</i>
5204895 5207105 God!
5210722 5212292 Get off me—
5213320 5215011 Holy shit!
5215674 5218799 Help! Help me get<br />this fucking thing off!
5227501 5229753 God! Jesus!<br />Oh, God! Oh, God!
5234508 5237511 <i>How come the company<br />sent us a goddamn robot?</i>
5237594 5241348 All I can think of is they must've wanted<br />the alien for their weapons division.
5241431 5244184 He's been protecting it right along.
5244267 5246561 Parker, will you plug it in?
5246645 5251525 <i>- I don't know why—</i><br />- Because he may know how to kill it.
5279219 5281763 <i>Ash, can you hear me?</i>
5284687 5286606 Ash?
5293738 5296490 Yes, I can hear you.
5300953 5306500 - What was your special order?<br />- You read it. I thought it was clear.
5306584 5310588 - What was it?<br />- Bring back life-form.
5310671 5315343 Priority one. All other<br />priorities rescinded.
5318346 5323059 The damn company!<br />What about our lives, you son of a bitch?
5323142 5327104 I repeat: All other priorities<br />are rescinded.
5327188 5328930 <i>How do we kill it, Ash?</i>
5329234 5333069 <i>There's got to be a way of killing it.<br />How— How do we do it?</i>
5333152 5334477 You can't.
5335795 5337057 That's bullshit!
5337284 5341300 You still don't understand what<br />you're dealing with, do you?
5342995 5345498 A perfect organism.
5348292 5351921 Its structural perfection<br />is matched only by its hostility.
5352004 5354173 You admire it.
5358302 5360388 I admire its purity.
5364725 5366644 A survivor...
5368729 5372983 unclouded by conscience,
5373067 5376696 remorse or delusions of morality.
5378698 5381367 <i>Look, I— I've heard enough of this,</i>
5381450 5383869 and I'm asking you to pull the plug.
5383953 5387289 <i>- Last word.</i><br />- What?
5389125 5393170 I can't lie to you<br />about your chances, but...
5396340 5398843 you have my sympathies.
5401262 5404306 We're gonna blow up the ship.
5404390 5407184 We'll take our chances in the shuttle.
5407268 5409603 - Blow up the ship.<br />- Good.
5409687 5411689 Come on.
5438223 5440586 When we throw the switches,<br />how long before the ship blows?
5440610 5441691 Ten minutes.
5441716 5442675 No bullshit.
5442699 5444168 If we ain't outta here<br />in ten minutes,
5444193 5446488 we won't need no rocket<br />to fly through space.
5447766 5450596 We're gonna need coolant<br />for the air support system.
5463665 5466334 You two go down, get all<br />the coolant you can carry.
5466418 5469337 I'll get the shuttle ready.<br />I'll give you about—
5469421 5471715 about seven minutes.
5471798 5474176 Come back up here.<br />I'll shut the switches off,
5474259 5476136 and we'll blow this fucker<br />off into space.
5476219 5477929 Okay. All right.<br />Come on.
5478013 5479639 - Ready?<br />- Take care of yourself.
5479723 5481391 Seven minutes.
5519016 5521181 <i>Take it easy.</i>
5525477 5527399 Jones.
5574566 5576568 Jones?
5610372 5612750 Okay, check the bottles.
5625937 5627939 Jones?
5632443 5633903 <i>- How you doin'?</i><br />- Fine.
5635321 5636594 Kitty.
5637110 5639033 <i>Okay. Go ahead.</i>
5640748 5642875 Jones?
5648143 5650295 Kitty, kitty, kitty,<br />kitty, kitty, kitty.
5650362 5652174 Come here, Jones.<br />Come here.
5652557 5654684 Jones?
5659002 5660752 Come here, boy.
5661125 5662634 Come here.
5662963 5664963 Nice kitty.
5665502 5667645 Jones?
5668531 5670234 Jones?
5674485 5677280 Come here.<br />Come here, sweetheart.
5678531 5680325 Jones.
5687540 5691419 Jones? Jones?
