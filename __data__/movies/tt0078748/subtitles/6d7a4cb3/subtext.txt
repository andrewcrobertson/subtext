411702 416624 The food is terrible.<br />Worst shit I've ever seen, man.
416707 419168 - <i>What you say?</i><br />- You got any biscuits over there?</i>
419251 421587 <i>I keep seeing corn bread.</i>
424340 426800 - I am cold.<br />- Still with us, Brett?
426884 431263 - Right.<br />- Oh, I feel dead.
431347 434224 Anybody ever tell you<br />you look dead, man?
436644 439146 <i>Oh, yeah, right.</i>
439229 441315 Now, I just forgot something, man.
441398 443359 Before we dock,
443442 445444 I think we oughta discuss<br />the bonus situation.
445569 447571 - Right.<br />- Brett and I, we think we oughta--
447655 450032 - We deserve full shares, right, baby?<br />- You see, Mr. Parker and I
450115 453744 feel that the bonus situation has<br />never been on an, an equitable level.
453827 457081 Well, you'll get what you're<br />contracted for like everybody else.
457206 459541 Yes, but everybody else<br />gets more than us.
459625 461794 Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.
461877 465297 Huh? Yeah, I saw it.<br />Yellow light's for my eyes only.
466674 468467 Okay, get dressed, huh?
468592 472012 - Parker, come on.<br />- Can I finish my coffee? Thank you.
472096 474556 It's the only thing good<br />on this ship.
528402 531071 <i>Morning, Mother.</i>
560684 563896 - Right.<br />- Okay.
563979 566273 Plug us in.
567524 569443 Thank you.
572905 576241 - Where's Earth?<br />- You should know.
576325 579495 It's not our system.
579578 580120 Scan.
583540 586543 I can't believe this.
586627 589880 Contact Traffic Control.

613112 615614 - Nothing.<br />- <i>Keep trying.</i>
615697 619868 <i>Calling Antarctica Traffic Control.<br />Do you read me, Antarctica? Over.</i>
619952 624456 I found it.<br />Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.
624581 630045 - We haven't reached the outer rim yet.<br />- That's hard to believe.
630129 634174 <i>What the hell are<br />we doing out here?</i>
634258 637010 I don't know. What the hell<br />are you talking about?
637094 640514 - That's not our system.<br />- I know that.
640597 644685 <i>Listen, do you ever notice<br />how they never come down here?</i>
644768 646895 <i>I mean, this is where<br />the work is, right?</i>
646979 649648 <i>Well, it's the same damn reason<br />we get a half share to their one.</i>
649731 651817 <i>Our time is their time.<br />That's the way they see it.</i>
651900 653819 - <i>No, but--<br />- Listen, man. Same old shit, man.</i>
653902 656029 <i>I think I know why they<br />don't come down here.</i>
656113 658615 <i>It's because of you.<br />You don't have no personality.</i>
660617 663412 <i>Wonder what they want now.<br />What's going on down here?</i>
666081 669209 - Um, you happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?<br />- Yes, of course.
669293 672212 - Thank you.<br />- Sorry.
676800 678802 <i>What's happenin' now, baby?</i>
680637 684850 Well... some of you may have<br />figured out we're not home yet.
684933 687311 - We're only halfway there.<br />- What?
687394 690772 Mother's interrupted<br />the course of our journey.
690856 692774 - Why?<br />- Yeah.
692858 695903 She's programmed to do that should<br />certain conditions arise. They have.
696028 699031 - <i>Like what?</i><br />- It seems she has...
699114 701325 intercepted a transmission<br />of unknown origin.
701450 704661 - <i>She got us up to check it out.</i><br />- A transmission? Out here?
704745 707497 - <i>Yeah.</i><br />- What kind of a transmission?
707581 711251 Acoustical beacon. It repeats<br />at intervals of 12 seconds.
711335 713212 - S.O.S.?<br />- I don't know.
713295 715214 Human?
715339 718175 - Unknown.<br />- <i>Well, so what?</i>
718258 720385 <i>We are obligated<br />under section 8--</i>
720469 722763 I hate to bring this up, but, uh,
722846 725182 this is a commercial ship,<br />not a rescue ship.
725307 728769 - Right.<br />- And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty.
728852 732731 And what about the money? If you wanna give<br />me some money to do it, I'll be happy to oblige.
732856 735150 - The man's right.<br />- Let's go over the bonus situation.
735234 739154 - I'm sorry. Can I say something?<br />- <i>Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>
739238 741865 There is a clause in the contract<br />which specifically states
741949 745160 any systematized transmission indicating<br />a possible intelligent origin
745244 746870 - must be investigated.<br />- <i>I don't wanna hear it.
746995 749164 - <i>We don't know if it's intelligent.<br />- I wanna go home and party.</i>
749248 751541 Parker, will you just listen to the man?!
753752 758298 On penalty of total forfeiture of shares.<br />No money.
759633 761218 You got that?
761301 765055 - Well... yeah.<br />- All right, we're going in.
765138 767057 - Yeah.<br />- We're goin' in, aren't we?

918458 923338 All right, inertial damping's going off.<br />Hold on, people, there's gonna be a little bump.
929845 932222 What the hell was that?
932305 934808 Pressure drop in intake three.<br />Must've lost a shield.
934891 936601 Let's go with it.
942983 946486 Dropping off now.
948864 950866 <i>Still dropping.</i>
952576 954536 Here we are. We've got it.

1033490 1037994 Somebody give me a straight answer!
1038078 1042123 - Is the hull breached?<br />- I don't see anything. We've still got pressure.
1042207 1045794 - Hit the screen.<br />- Right.
1052759 1056805 <i>Secondary load sharing unit...</i>
1056888 1058807 <i>is out.</i>
1058890 1062018 <i>Three to four cells are gone.</i>

1067566 1070860 <i>We can't fix it out here anyway,<br />and we need to reroute...</i>
1070986 1073389 <i>a couple of these ducts,<br />wouldn't you say, Brett?</i>
1073489 1074489 Dry dock time.
1074573 1076908 Dry dock.<br />Tell her we need to dry-dock.
1076992 1078910 Look, we couldn't fix it<br />out here anyway.
1078994 1080912 We gotta reroute all these ducts,
1080996 1083623 and in order to do that<br />we've got to dry-dock.
1083807 1085959 What else?
1086042 1087961 <i>Some fragments kicked up,</i>
1088044 1090380 <i>and we've got to clean it all out<br />and repressurize it.</i>
1090463 1092924 <i>How long before we're functional?</i>
1093008 1097470 - Look, what is-- What--<br />- It's 17 hours, tell her.
1097554 1100307 - At least 25 hours.<br />- Yeah.
1100390 1102809 <i>Get started on the floor panel.<br />I'll be right down.</i>
1102892 1104936 What the hell's<br />she comin' down here for?
1105020 1107022 She better stay the fuck out of my way,<br />I'll tell you that.
1107105 1109858 I'd like to see what she's gonna do<br />when she gets here.
1119909 1123622 - Any response yet?<br />- <i>No. Absolutely nothing.</i>
1123705 1126875 <i>Except the same transmission<br />every 12 seconds.</i>
1126958 1128960 <i>All the other channels are dead.</i>
1134049 1137052 Kick on the floods.
1151733 1155570 - We can't go anywhere in this.<br />- Mmm.
1155654 1157947 Well, Mother says the sun's<br />coming up in 20 minutes.
1158073 1161409 - How far are we from the source of transmission?<br />- Uh, northeast.
1161493 1163912 Just under 2,000 meters.
1163995 1166498 Walking distance?
1166581 1169125 Well--
1169250 1172337 - Can you give me an atmospheric?<br />- Yes.
1175423 1177425 <i>Oh.</i>
1178718 1180804 It's almost primordial.
1180887 1182931 <i>There's inert nitrogen,</i>
1183014 1185684 <i>high concentration of<br />carbon dioxide crystals, methane.</i>
1185767 1187686 <i>I'm working on the trace elements.</i>
1187769 1189896 - Anything else?<br />- Yes.
1189979 1191898 It's...
1191981 1194359 Rock, lava base...
1194442 1196361 <i>deep</i> cold.
1196444 1200365 - <i>Well below the line.<br />- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
1200448 1203118 <i>I'll volunteer to be in<br />the first group to go out.</i>
1203201 1205954 <i>Yeah, that figures.</i>
1206037 1208832 <i>You too, Lambert.</i>
1208957 1209760 Swell.
1210460 1212460 <i>Better break out the weapons.</i>
1286284 1289454 <i>I can't see a goddamn thing.</i>
1290955 1292916 <i>Ash, are you receiving?</i>
1297754 1300048 <i>Good contact on my board.</i>
1300131 1304385 <i>Clear and free.<br />Keep the line open. Let's go.</i>
1318733 1321569 Hey, Ripley.
1321653 1323613 Hey, Ripley,<br />I wanna ask you a question.
1326115 1328910 If they find what they're lookin' for out there,<br />does that mean we get full shares?
1328993 1333248 Don't worry, Parker. You'll get<br />whatever's coming to you.
1333331 1335875 Look, I'm not gonna do<br />any more work...
1335959 1338878 - till we get this straightened out.<br />- <i>Brett...</i>
1339003 1342590 - you're guaranteed by law to get a share.<br />- <i>What?</i>
1342674 1345802 - Why don't you just fuck off.<br />- What?
1345885 1348346 <i>What'd you say, Rip?</i>
1348429 1351933 If you have any trouble,<br />I'll be on the bridge.
1353518 1356187 <i>Hey, Ripley, come back here!</i>
1361192 1364195 - Son of a bitch.<br />- What's the matter?
1374205 1376916 <i>Can't see a goddamn thing.</i>
1377000 1379752 - <i>Quit griping.<br />- I like griping.</i>
1379836 1381880 <i>Come on. Knock it off.</i>
1392849 1394767 How's it going?
1397061 1398980 All right.
1399063 1401399 Have you tried putting that transmission<br />through E.C.I.U.?
1401482 1404569 <i>No. Mother hasn't identified it yet.</i>
1404652 1406988 - You mind if I give it a shot?<br />- <i>Please do.</i>
1483147 1485566 <i>Ash, can you see this?</i>
1485650 1487860 Yes, I can.
1490989 1492991 I've never seen anything like it.
1501916 1504419 <i>Very bizarre.</i>
1507714 1509674 <i>You said it.</i>
1518433 1520768 <i>All right.</i>
1520852 1523396 <i>Moving on to second...<br />position.</i>
1523479 1526065 <i>What is it?</i>
1528192 1529902 <i>Let's get out of here.</i>
1529986 1532655 <i>We've got this far.<br />We must go on.</i>
1532739 1534699 <i>We have to go on.</i>
1537910 1541539 Will you say that again?<br />Shit.
1543082 1546878 <i>Ash, as you can see,<br />it's kind of hard to describe.</i>
1546961 1549630 I'm going back to the console.
1564562 1566814 <i>Seems to be solid.</i>
1566898 1569484 To walk...<br />You can on it.
1602183 1605228 Dallas?
1609148 1610525 Dallas?
1663536 1665746 Come on down here.<br />Something different down here.
1667248 1669667 I don't know what it is, but...
1669750 1673254 See if we can get up that wall.<br />If we can get up that wall, we can find out.
1740238 1742240 Amazing.
1744450 1746827 <i>Alien life-form.</i>
1748162 1751165 <i>Looks like it's been dead<br />a long time.</i>
1751249 1753918 <i>Fossilized.</i>
1754001 1756963 <i>Looks like it's grown<br />out of the chair.</i>
1772687 1774814 <i>Bones are bent outward,</i>
1774897 1777984 <i>like he exploded from inside.</i>
1782613 1785449 <i>Wonder what happened<br />to the rest of the crew.</i>
1789328 1792915 <i>Let's get the hell out of here.</i>
1804552 1807013 <i>Hey, Dallas, Lambert,<br />come on over here.</i>
1810808 1812810 <i>Come on.</i>
1819817 1822862 - What do you got?<br />- <i>See what you make of this.</i>
1830369 1832455 Ash.
1832538 1835958 <i>That transmission...<br />Mother's deciphered part of it.</i>
1836042 1838502 - <i>It doesn't look like an S.O.S.</i><br />- What is it, then?
1838586 1841922 Well, I...<br />It looks like a warning.
1842006 1844592 - <i>I'm gonna go out after them.</i><br />- What's the point?
1847553 1850681 I mean, by the time it takes<br />to get there, you'll...
1850765 1853225 <i>they'll know if it's<br />a warning or not, yes?</i>
1880294 1882338 <i>You okay down there?</i>
1886634 1889595 - <i>Can you see anything?<br />- Uh... a cave.</i>
1890888 1893849 <i>A ca--a cave of some sort.<br />But I...</i>
1896018 1898813 <i>Well, I don't know, but it's like<br />the goddamn tropics in here.</i>
1901148 1904276 <i>What the hell is this?</i>
1940479 1943441 <i>The cave is completely enclosed,</i>
1943524 1945901 <i>and it's full of...</i>
1945985 1949822 <i>leathery objects,<br />like eggs or something.</i>
1967590 1970092 <i>There's a layer of mist...</i>
1970176 1974180 <i>just covering the eggs<br />that reacts when broken.</i>
1977391 1980311 <i>Kane? You all right?</i>
1980394 1982938 <i>I-I'm okay. All right.</i>
1985191 1987359 <i>I'm okay. I just slipped.</i>
2007713 2010424 <i>Appears to be completely sealed.</i>
2036200 2038452 <i>Wait a minute.<br />There's movement.</i>
2040287 2044041 <i>It seems to have life.<br />Organic life.</i>
2108647 2111066 - <i>You there, Ripley?</i><br />- I'm right here.
2117781 2120701 - <i>Okay, Ripley, I'm at the inner lock hatch now.<br />- Right.</i>
2130544 2133297 - Ripley. We're clean. Let us in.<br />- <i>Right here.</i>
2133380 2136133 - What happened to Kane?<br />- <i>Something has attached itself to him.</i>
2136216 2139762 - <i>We have to get him to the infirmary right away.</i><br />- What kind of thing?
2139845 2142097 - <i>I need a clear definition.<br />- An organism. Open the hatch.</i>
2142181 2144642 Wait a minute. If we let it in,<br />the ship could be infected.
2144725 2148520 You know the quarantine procedure.<br />24 hours for decontamination.
2148604 2150481 <i>He could die in 24 hours.<br />Open the hatch.</i>
2150564 2153400 Listen to me. If we break quarantine,<br />we could all die.
2153484 2157821 <i>Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?<br />We have to get him inside.</i>
2159239 2161408 No. I can't do that.
2161492 2163911 <i>And if you were in my position,<br />you'd do the same.</i>
2163994 2165913 <i>Ripley, this is an order.<br />Open that hatch right now.</i>
2165996 2167873 - <i>Do you hear me?<br />- Yes.</i>
2167956 2170000 <i>Ripley, this is an order!<br />Do you hear me?</i>
2170084 2173837 Yes, I read you.<br />The answer is negative.
2175964 2177925 <i>Inner hatch opened.</i>
2204576 2207621 My God.
2217756 2219842 What the hell is that?
2221677 2223387 How is he?
2226306 2229143 How are we gonna<br />get that off him?
2229268 2232688 - How are we gonna get it off?<br />- I'm gonna get some instruments.
2236734 2238610 My God.
2241155 2244867 Right...<br />I'll make an incision here.
2244992 2250414 - Try and remove one of the digitals from--<br />- You're gonna do what?
2250497 2253584 Finger. I'm gonna try and get<br />his finger off. Just a minute.
2258881 2262509 - <i>No, that's not-- it's tearing his scalp.<br />- I know!</i>
2262593 2266889 It's not coming off without tearing<br />his face off with it.
2266972 2268807 We'll have to take a look<br />at him inside. Right.
2272352 2275105 How come they don't freeze him?
2275189 2278108 <i>How come you guys don't freeze him?</i>
2293749 2296210 All right, you can<br />take your mask off.
2314686 2320609 - What's it got down his throat?<br />- <i>I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.</i>
2320692 2325239 Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma,<br />then keeps him alive.
2325322 2328158 <i>Now what the hell is that?</i>
2328283 2330202 - We gotta get it off of him.<br />- Just a minute.
2330285 2332204 Just a minute.
2332287 2334748 I mean, let's not be too hasty.
2334832 2337000 We don't know anything about...
2337084 2339044 <i>it.</i>
2339127 2342339 <i>Now, we're assuming it's feeding<br />him oxygen. If we remove it,</i>
2343590 2345592 it could kill him.
2348178 2350347 I'm willing to take that chance.<br />Let's cut it off him now.
2350472 2351984 You'll take responsibility?
2352084 2354184 Yes, yes, I'll take responsibility.<br />Get him out of there.
2355936 2358063 <i>Where do you wanna do this?</i>
2358146 2361316 We'll make an incision<br />just below the knuckle there.
2361400 2363026 - Right here.<br />- <i>Stand by.</i>
2371869 2373871 <i>Good God!</i>
2377249 2380544 <i>That crap's gonna<br />eat through the hull.</i>
2382504 2384798 That thing's gonna eat through<br />the goddamn hull. Come on!
2384882 2387426 What's going on?
2387509 2389511 This way.
2397603 2399688 <i>Next deck.</i>
2416038 2419124 <i>There it is.</i>
2420876 2422836 Don't get under it!<br />Don't get under it.
2428675 2430677 Looks like it's stopping.
2433555 2435474 - Take a look at this, man.<br />- Yeah.
2435557 2439102 Brett, give me-- What do you got,<br />a pen there? Give it to me, quick.
2439186 2441355 Come on! Come on!
2445734 2447653 <i>Don't get any on your arm.</i>
2454701 2457704 It stopped.
2457788 2461833 Don't see anything like that<br />except, uh, molecular acid.
2461917 2465003 It must be using it for blood.
2465087 2467005 It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
2467089 2469299 <i>You don't dare kill it.</i>
2469383 2471259 What about Kane?
2473220 2476682 - Here's your pen back.<br />- <i>What do we do now?</i>
2476765 2479893 Leave Kane to Ash.<br />You get back to work.
2482104 2484022 Well, what...
2492364 2495283 Okay.
2495367 2498245 Try it.
2502290 2504334 Dammit. I thought sure<br />that was it.
2504418 2507671 Try it again.
2507754 2510340 I feel like I've been<br />in this place a month.
2511842 2514386 We shouldn't have landed in<br />this place in the first place.
2516096 2520350 Shouldn't have landed on<br />this damn ball, I know that.
2520434 2524187 Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and<br />get out of here, the sooner we can go home.
2524271 2525605 This place gives me the creeps.
2590337 2592839 <i>That's amazing. What is it?</i>
2594382 2597594 - Ah, yes, it is.<br />- Um...
2597677 2599846 I don't know yet.
2602599 2605477 Did you want something?
2605560 2607854 Yes. I, uh--
2609689 2612609 I'd like to have a little talk.<br />How's, uh, How's Kane?
2612692 2615278 He's holding. No changes.
2615362 2619991 And, uh, our guest?
2620075 2622994 - Well...<br />- Hmm?
2623078 2624955 Well, as I said, I'm still...
2625038 2626998 collating, actually, but, uh,
2627082 2631128 I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer<br />of protein polysaccharides.
2632879 2635173 He has a funny habit<br />of shedding his cells...
2635257 2639136 and replacing them with...<br />polarized silicon,
2639219 2641304 which gives him<br />a prolonged resistance...
2641388 2645308 to adverse environmental conditions.
2645433 2647435 - Is that enough for you?<br />- That's plenty.
2647561 2650814 - What does it mean?<br />- Please don't do that. Thank you.
2650897 2653984 I'm sorry.
2654067 2655986 Well, it's an interesting<br />combination of elements,
2656069 2660574 making him a tough<br />little son of a bitch.
2660657 2663034 And you let him in.
2663118 2665495 I was obeying a direct order, remember?
2665579 2669666 Ash, when Dallas and Kane<br />are off the ship,
2669749 2671835 I'm senior officer.
2671918 2674838 <i>Oh, yes. I forgot.</i>
2674921 2678341 You also forgot the science division's<br />basic quarantine law.
2678425 2680594 - No, that I didn't forget.<br />- Oh, I see.
2680677 2683346 - You just broke it.<br />- Huh?
2683430 2687058 Look, what would you<br />have done with Kane? Hmm?
2687142 2690437 You knew his only chance of survival<br />was to get him in here.
2690520 2692939 Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,
2693023 2695025 you risk everybody's life.
2695108 2698195 Maybe I should've left him outside.
2698278 2702073 Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,<br />but it was a risk I was willing to take.
2702157 2704367 That's a pretty big risk...
2704451 2706369 for a science officer.
2706453 2709789 It's, uh, not exactly<br />out of the manual, is it?
2711208 2714628 I do take my responsibilities<br />as seriously as you, you know.
2715795 2717714 <i>You do your job...</i>
2717797 2719883 and let me do mine, yes?
2755502 2759839 - <i>Where's Dallas?<br />- In the shuttle.</i>
2764928 2767514 - Dallas.<br />- <i>I think you should have a look at Kane.</i>
2767597 2771601 - Why?<br />- <i>Something's happened.</i>
2771726 2774729 - Serious?<br />- <i>Interesting.</i>
2779276 2781194 Ripley, meet me in<br />the infirmary right away.
2785365 2787325 <i>Where is it?</i>
2787409 2790245 <i>Well, I don't know. I mean,<br />we ought to try and find it.</i>
2790328 2792247 <i>Yeah, let's check it.</i>
2818898 2821192 Dallas, please be careful.
2862233 2864569 Sorry.
2896434 2900605 No, not in the corner.<br />Psst. Have one of these.
2902232 2904150 <i>Just in case.</i>
2916579 2920083 Kane? Dallas?
2924212 2927382 You okay? I didn't see it.<br />Was it in the overhead?
2927507 2931302 What? It was up there somewhere.<br />My God.
2931386 2934514 - <i>Cover up the damn thing!<br />- Wait.</i>
2934597 2937100 That's alive!
2937183 2939185 That's a reflex action.
2941104 2943022 Well, we've gotta have a look at this.
2954909 2957078 Excuse me.
2963710 2966463 - <i>Seems dead enough.<br />- Well, good. Let's get rid of it.</i>
2968006 2970508 Ripley, for God's sake,
2970592 2974012 this is the first time that we've<br />encountered a species like this.
2974095 2976639 <i>It has to go back. All sorts<br />of tests have to be made.</i>
2976723 2979184 Ash, are you kidding?<br />This thing bled acid.
2979267 2982020 Who knows what it's<br />gonna do when it's dead.
2982103 2985315 Think it's safe to assume<br />it isn't a zombie.
2985398 2988067 Dallas, it has to go back.
2988151 2990653 Well, I'd soon...
2990737 2993239 as not burn it at the stake,<br />but you're the science officer.
2993323 2994657 - It's your decision, Ash.<br />- Dallas.
2996034 2998369 How come I've got to change my mind?<br />The decision's been made.
2998453 3000872 I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.<br />I just want you to listen--
3000955 3002874 Will you listen to--
3005251 3007504 <i>Just tell me how you can leave<br />that kind of decision to him.</i>
3007587 3009589 Look, I just run the ship!
3009672 3012175 Anything that has to do with the<br />Science Division, <i>Ash</i> has the final word..
3012258 3013553 How does that happen?
3013653 3015630 It happens, my dear, because that's<br />what the company <i>wants</i> to happen.
3015637 3018348 Since when is that standard procedure?
3018431 3021100 Standard procedure is to do what<br />the hell they tell you to do.
3021184 3023269 Did you ever ship out<br />with Ash before?
3023353 3026606 I went out five times<br />with another science officer.
3026689 3030693 They replaced him two days before<br />we left Thedus with Ash. Hmm?
3030777 3035198 - I don't trust him.<br />- I don't trust anybody.
3035323 3037777 <i>What's happening with the repairs?<br />How's it going?</i>
3037877 3039077 They're pretty much finished now.
3039160 3041079 <i>Why the hell didn't you tell me so?</i>
3041162 3043748 - Because there's still some things left to do.<br />- Like what?
3043831 3046209 <i>Well... we're blind<br />on "B" and "C" decks.</i>
3046334 3049170 - <i>The-The reserve power system's blown--</i><br />- Oh, no, no, that's a bunch of horseshit.
3049295 3052423 - We can take off without that.<br />- <i>Yeah, we can. You think that's a good idea?</i>
3052507 3055385 Look, I just wanna get the<br />hell out of here, all right?
3079576 3082203 Dust in the intakes again.<br />Number 2's overheating.
3082287 3084581 Spit on it for two minutes,<br />would you, for Christ's sake?
3086082 3088418 <i>We're hot. We're getting hotter.</i>
3091170 3094799 <i>Engine room, red clip status?</i>
3094924 3098886 - One kilometer on ascension.<br />- <i>Engage artificial gravity.</i>
3098970 3102515 - <i>Engaged.</i><br />- I'm altering the vector... now.
3106894 3108890 <i>Inhibit C.N.G. control<br />upward to T.A.C.S.</i>
3108896 3111980 <i>Inhibit C.N.G.--</i>
3111983 3116821 - Struts retract.<br />- <i>Struts retracted.</i>
3116904 3121034 <i>Max stress to fifth overload.</i>
3121117 3123536 <i>Ease it back.</i>
3124662 3126706 <i>She's great. Beautiful.</i>
3138217 3141346 Walk in the park. When we fix something,<br />we stay fixed.
3141429 3144182 - <i>Don't we, Brett baby?<br />- Right.</i>
3159572 3161491 <i>What I think we should do<br />is just freeze him.</i>
3161574 3163868 <i>I mean, if he's got a disease,<br />why don't we stop it where it is?</i>
3163951 3167580 - He can always get to a doctor when we get back home.<br />- Right.
3167664 3171376 Whenever he says <i>anything</i>, you say "right", Brett.<br />You know that?
3171459 3173628 Right.
3173711 3176589 Parker, what do you think? Your staff<br />just follows you around, says "right."
3176673 3179092 - Just like a regular parrot.<br />- Yeah, shape up.
3179175 3182178 - What are you, some kind of parrot?<br />- Right.
3182261 3185264 Come on. Knock it off! Kane's gonna<br />have to go into quarantine.
3185348 3188142 - That's it!<br />- Yes, and so will we.
3188226 3190478 Well, how about a little something<br />to lower your spirits?
3190561 3192647 Thrill me, will you, please?
3192730 3194649 Well, according to my calculations,
3194732 3196651 based on time spent getting<br />to and from the planet--
3196776 3200029 - Just give me the short version. How far to Earth?<br />- Ten months.
3200113 3202115 - Oh, God.<br />- Great.
3202198 3203991 Yes.
3204075 3206035 <i>Dallas, I think you should<br />come and see Kane.</i>
3206160 3208204 - Has his condition changed?<br />- <i>It's simpler if you'd just come and see him.</i>
3208287 3209288 <i>We're on our way.</i>
3213084 3215753 Right.
3218131 3220508 <i>How are you doing?</i>
3222885 3225555 - Thank you.<br />- <i>How you doin'?</i>
3225638 3227849 Um, terrific.<br />Next silly question.
3231436 3233479 Oh, thank you.
3235523 3238151 Do you remember anything<br />about the planet?
3241070 3243489 What's the last thing<br />you <i>do</i> remember?
3245032 3247243 Huh?
3250413 3252331 I remember some...
3252415 3255084 horrible dream about...<br />smothering.
3255168 3256961 <i>And--</i>
3257044 3259547 And... Anyway, where are we?
3259672 3262008 - Right here.<br />- We're on our way home.
3262091 3264177 Yeah, back to the old freezerinos.
3266345 3268514 Could I have something to eat<br />before we go back?
3268598 3270433 I-I need something myself.
3270516 3274187 Yeah, right. One more meal<br />before bedtime. I'm buyin'.
3274270 3277315 - Hey, that's a break.<br />- <i>Bedtime.</i>
3297084 3299629 The first thing that I'm gonna do<br />when I get back...
3299712 3301714 is to... get some decent food.
3301798 3304509 I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,<br />I've eaten worse food than this,
3304634 3306203 but then, I've tasted better,<br />you know what I'm sayin'?
3306293 3307303 <i>The other one over there.</i>
3307386 3310473 Well, you pound down the stuff<br />like there's no tomorrow.
3310556 3313851 Listen, I'd rather be eatin' something else,<br />but, uh... right now I'm thinkin' food.
3313935 3317855 <i>Well, you should know.<br />You know what it's made of.</i>
3317939 3320983 No, man, I don't wanna talk about<br />what it's made of.
3321108 3323027 I'm eatin' this just to--
3324445 3326322 What's the matter?
3326447 3328699 - The food ain't <i>that</i> bad, baby.<br />- What's wrong, Kane?
3328783 3330701 <i>Are you choking?</i>
3330785 3332662 What's wrong?
3334455 3336624 What? What?
3336707 3339752 - This is serious.<br />- Kane, what's the matter?
3339877 3343840 It's okay!
3343923 3347552 Hold him down!<br />Hold him--
3347635 3349762 <i>Get the spoon in!</i>
3349846 3353432 Dammit!
3353558 3355810 - Get it into his mouth!<br />- I'm trying!
3383671 3387550 <i>Oh, my God! Oh, God!</i>
3395683 3397727 - <i>No!</i><br />- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
3414327 3416495 <i>Dallas?</i>
3416579 3419165 - <i>Dallas?<br />- Yeah.</i>
3419248 3423085 - <i>Anything?<br />- No. You?</i>
3423169 3425546 <i>Nothing.</i>
3425630 3428215 - <i>You see anything?<br />- No.</i>
3461791 3464585 <i>Inner hatch sealed.</i>
3467630 3470675 <i>Anybody wanna say anything?</i>
3507169 3510631 This is just an ordinary prod,<br />like a cattle prod.
3510715 3512633 It's got a portable battery.
3512717 3515428 <i>it's insulated all the way here,<br />all the way up to here.</i>.
3515511 3518472 Just make damn sure nobody puts<br />their hand on the end of it.
3522018 3523936 <i>It shouldn't damage<br />the little bastard,</i>
3524020 3526522 unless its skin's thinner than ours.
3526605 3530776 But... it will give him<br />a little incentive.
3530860 3532903 Now we just have to find it.
3532987 3536782 I've taken care of that.<br />I've designed this... tracking device.
3536866 3541287 You just set it to search for<br />a moving object, like so.
3541370 3543873 <i>Hasn't got much of a range, but when<br />you get within a certain distance,</i>
3543956 3546000 <i>it'll start to give off a signal.</i>>
3546083 3549170 What's it key on?
3549253 3553007 Micro changes in air density.
3553090 3555468 Give me a demo.
3557136 3560806 <i>See? Again.</i>
3560890 3563225 Got ya.
3563309 3566812 Two teams.<br />Ash, Lambert and I.
3566896 3570316 Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.
3570399 3572902 Now, anyone see this thing,<br />you catch it in the net...
3572985 3575112 that Parker's holding on his lap.
3575196 3578115 Parker, I don't want any<br />heroics out of you, all right?
3578199 3581619 <i>Catch it, put it in the air lock,<br />get rid of it.</i>
3581702 3583621 <i>Now, channels are open on all decks.</i>
3583704 3587792 I want you to communicate, keep in<br />touch at all times, all right?
3587875 3589877 Let's go.
3603557 3606102 <i>I thought you fixed 12 module.</i>
3606185 3608562 <i>We did.</i>
3608646 3610689 <i>I don't understand it.</i>
3612566 3614860 <i>The circuits must have burned out.</i>
3627748 3628626 <i>What do we got here?</i>
3628626 3630626 <i>Dammit! Hold your light<br />over here, would you?
3630709 3632628 <i>Yeah, that's it.</i>
3632711 3636632 - <i>I don't know if this is going to work.<br />- Right.</i>
3636715 3639343 If I could just put this--<br />put this in there.
3639426 3642221 - <i>Right.<br />- Oh, dammit.</i>
3645391 3647476 <i>Check the insulation.</i>
3647560 3649895 <i>Oh, shit!</i>
3672251 3675588 - Steady.<br />- According to this, it's within five meters.
3676797 3678924 <i>Open the door.</i>
3683554 3686390 <i>Micro changes in air density, my ass.</i>
3691562 3694023 <i>It's within five meters.</i>
3694106 3695941 <i>Be careful.</i>
3725137 3727640 - <i>Christ.<br />- Don't do that. Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>
3727723 3730476 <i>You guys, stick together.</i>
3745950 3749662 - Don't fail me now.<br />- <i>What?</i>
3749787 3751956 - What is it?<br />- Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
3752039 3753958 Where?
3754041 3756043 <i>Here, here, take this.</i>
3756126 3758545 <i>Get over there and get the net.
3758671 3761382 - Got it?<br />- I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
3761465 3764051 Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
3765803 3768889 All right, Parker.<br />When I say...
3769848 3772476 All right, now!
3772559 3774561 Easy.
3778190 3780859 Wait! Don't let him go!
3780943 3783153 What the hell are you doing, man!?
3783237 3785155 It's the cat, man.
3791578 3794456 Hey, look, now.<br />We had to bag it, man.
3794540 3797751 Now we might pick it up<br />on the tracker again.
3797876 3800129 - I'll-I'll-I'll--<br />- Go and get it, man.
3801130 3803007 All right. You get him.<br />We'll go on.
3814518 3816937 Here, kitty!
3817021 3819356 Here, kitty, kitty!
3819440 3821984 Enough of that kitty crap.
3822067 3826030 Jones?
3826113 3828032 Jonesy?
3828115 3830117 Here, Jonesy!
3837875 3839793 <i>Jonesy?</i>
3844965 3847301 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
3853807 3856185 Here, Jonesy.
3867988 3869865 Jonesy?
3881251 3883462 Here, kitty, kitty.
3970632 3973218 Kitty, kitty, kitty.
3974803 3977181 Here, Jonesy.
3977264 3979391 Jonesy.
3981518 3983479 Kitty, kitty.
4032361 4034363 Jonesy?
4041078 4043914 Hey. Hey.<br />Come on, Jonesy.
4043997 4046291 Come on, baby.<br />That's a kitty.
4046375 4049753 <i>That's a kitty.<br />Come on, baby.</i>
4049836 4052631 That's a kitty.
4052714 4056593 Hey, hey.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you.
4056677 4058679 <i>Come on.</i>
4094840 4097676 Whatever it was, it was--<br />it was big and--
4101096 4103432 You're sure it took him<br />into the air shaft?
4103515 4105642 Disappeared into<br />one of the cooling ducts.
4105726 4108061 No question, it's...<br />it's using the air ducts to move around.
4112190 4114359 Could he want Brett alive?
4115694 4118363 - What?<br />- Could Brett be alive?
4118447 4121116 No. I mean...<br />I don't think so.
4121199 4125120 Well, this air shaft may<br />work to our advantage.
4125203 4130000 Here it leads up to and comes out<br />in the main air lock.
4130083 4132377 All right, there's only one<br />big opening along the way.
4132461 4135797 We can cover that up,<br />and then we...
4135881 4138383 drive it into the air lock<br />and zap it into outer space.
4138467 4140844 This son of a bitch is <i>huge!</i>
4140927 4144264 - <i>I mean, it's like a man. It's big!</i><br />- Kane's son.
4146725 4149186 Come on, Ash. I mean, Science Department<br />should be able to help us.
4149269 4151647 What can we do to drive it?
4151730 4154024 Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well<br />to our atmosphere,
4154107 4156234 considering its nutritional requirements.
4156318 4158862 - The only thing we don't know about is temperature.<br />- Okay. What about temperature?
4158945 4161657 - What happens if we change it?<br />- <i>Let's try it.</i>
4161740 4165035 I mean, most animals<br />retreat from fire. Yes?
4165118 4167579 Fire, yeah.<br />Parker, can you rig,
4167663 4170165 <i>uh, three or four incinerator units?</i>
4170248 4172834 Give me about 20 minutes.<br />I'll do it.
4172918 4174586 - Who gets to go into the vent?<br />- I do.
4177297 4181051 No. You and Ash...
4181134 4183345 take the main air lock.
4183428 4187599 Parker, Lambert, you cover up that<br />maintenance opening, please.
4187683 4189643 <i>Right.</i>
4286364 4289910 - <i>I'm at the first junction.</i><br />- Dallas, I'm right here.
4289993 4292789 - <i>Parker?</i><br />- Yeah.
4292889 4293789 <i>Lambert?</i>
4293872 4296166 <i>We're in position. I'm just trying<br />to get a reading here.</i>
4296249 4299002 - The air lock is open.<br />- <i>Okay, Ripley.</i>
4299085 4301755 Ready.
4311097 4313850 <i>All right.<br />I've got a reading on you now.</i>
4350929 4354266 Uh, open the hatch<br />to the third junction.
4369698 4372617 <i>Okay, I'm through.</i>
4372701 4374619 - <i>Ripley?</i><br />- Yes.
4374703 4377539 <i>Close all the hatches behind me.</i>
4377622 4379791 <i>I'm moving on.</i>
4394472 4396683 <i>Dallas, hold it a minute.<br />I think I got it.</i>
4396808 4401438 - <i>Yes, I've got it.</i><br />- <i>Where?</i>
4401521 4405275 <i>It's somewhere around<br />the third junction.</i>
4405358 4407360 Okay, moving on.
4426713 4430258 <i>It is right around there. Now, Dallas,<br />you're gonna have to be careful.</i>
4440435 4445607 All right.<br />I've reached...
4445690 4449527 the third junction, and I'm going down.
4466628 4469965 The hell's the matter with that box?
4470048 4473843 Dallas, you're gonna have to hold<br />your position for a minute. I...
4473927 4475971 <i>I've lost the signal.</i>
4476054 4478974 What?<br />You sure?
4479057 4483144 <i>Look around. Are you sure that it's not there?<br />I mean, it's got to be around there somewhere.</i>
4487315 4491194 <i>Check that out, Lambert.<br />You may be getting interference.</i>
4491277 4493113 <i>Dallas, are you sure<br />there's no sign of it?</i>
4493196 4497909 <i>I mean, it</i> is <i>there.<br />It's gotta be around there.</i>
4499619 4504708 - Dallas?<br />- God, what is happening?
4504791 4507544 <i>All right.</i>
4511589 4516052 Uh, am I... am I clear, Lambert?<br />I want to get the hell out of here.
4518221 4520807 <i>Oh, God.<br />It's moving right towards you.</i>
4522934 4524686 Uh...
4529024 4533319 Move! Get out of there!<br />Behind you! Move!
4533403 4536531 <i>Dallas! Move, Dallas!<br />Move, Dallas!</i>
4536614 4540285 <i>Get out! Move!</i>
4540368 4541995 The other way, God!
4543955 4545749 Dallas?
4545832 4547584 - No...<br />- Take it easy.
4547667 4549794 <i>Dallas?</i>
4555300 4557469 We found this laying there.
4559137 4561389 No blood...
4561473 4564851 no Dallas...<br />nothing.
4571149 4573568 - <i>How come I don't hear nobody saying nothing?</i><br />- I'm thinking.
4576696 4581242 Unless somebody has<br />got a better idea...
4581326 4583578 we'll proceed with Dallas' plan.
4583661 4587415 What? And end up like the others?
4587499 4589918 Ohh. No, you're out of your mind.
4590001 4594255 - Got a better idea?<br />- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
4594339 4596591 We get the shuttle and just<br />get the hell out of here.
4596674 4599636 We take our chances and just hope<br />that somebody picks us up.
4599719 4601596 Lambert...
4601721 4605433 - The shuttle won't take four.<br />- <i>Then why don't we draw straws and--</i>
4605517 4608561 I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for<br />killing that goddamn thing right now.
4608645 4610730 <i>Okay.</i>
4610855 4612857 Well, let's talk about killing it.
4612941 4616111 We know it's using the air shafts--<br />Will you listen to me, Parker?!
4616194 4618988 - Shut up!<br />- Let's hear it.
4619072 4620990 Let's hear it.
4621074 4624285 It's using the air shafts.
4624410 4627163 - We don't know that.<br />- That's the only way!
4627247 4630333 We'll move in pairs.<br />We'll go step by step...
4630416 4633336 and cut off every bulkhead<br />and every vent
4633419 4636673 until we have it cornered, and then<br />we'll blow it the fuck out into space.
4636756 4638925 Is that acceptable to you?
4639050 4644139 - If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.<br />- Obviously, it means killing it.
4644222 4646015 But we have to stick together.
4647392 4650812 - <i>How are our weapons?</i><br />- The weapons are fine.
4650937 4654816 - This one needs refueling.<br />- <i>Will you get it, please?</i>
4654941 4658987 - Ash, go with him.<br />- No, no. I can manage, Ash.
4659070 4661072 Don't follow me.
4664576 4666578 Ash?
4667912 4670415 Any suggestions from you or Mother?
4672292 4676171 <i>No, we're still collating.</i>
4676554 4678506 You're what?
4678590 4680800 You're "still collating"?
4680884 4683928 I find that hard to believe.
4685972 4689184 - What would you like me to do?<br />- <i>Just what you've been doing, Ash...</i>
4689267 4692187 <i>Nothing.<br />I've got access to Mother now,</i>
4692270 4695273 <i>and I'll get my own answers,<br />thank you.</i>
4697859 4700403 All right.
4810388 4813725 There is an explanation<br />for this, you know.
4813808 4817729 Is there really? I don't wanna<br />hear your goddamn explanation!
4819897 4822984 I want-- I want--
4824527 4828740 I want-- I w--
4841669 4844756 Parker. Lambert?
4853014 4856434 Ash, open the door.
4866069 4868071 Ash?
4871949 4873951 <i>Will you open the door?</i>
4877497 4878831 Let me by, Ash.
4914992 4916994 Yaah!
4960913 4963374 The hell are you doing?
4970673 4972675 Aahhh!
4981225 4985021 <i>Get her up. Get her up! Get her up!<br />Get her up! Get her up! Get her up!</i>
4996365 4998701 Android!<br />He's an android!
5013508 5015510 Jesus!
5018721 5021974 <i>It's a robot!<br />Ash is a goddamn robot!</i>
5023935 5026145 God!
5028606 5032276 <i>Oh! Get off me--<br />Oh!</i>
5032360 5034320 <i>Holy shit!</i>
5034403 5038908 Help! Help me get<br />this fucking thing off!
5042745 5045081 Aah!
5046541 5048793 - Oh, God!<br />- Jesus! Oh, God!
5053548 5056551 <i>How come the company<br />sent us a goddamn robot?</i>
5056634 5060388 <i>All I can think of is they must've wanted<br />the alien for their Weapons Division.</i>
5060471 5063224 <i>He's been protecting it right along.</i>
5063307 5065601 <i>Parker, will you plug it in?</i>
5065685 5070565 - <i>Uh... I don't know why--<br />- Because he may know how to kill it.</i>
5098259 5100803 <i>Ash, can you hear me?</i>
5103723 5105641 <i>Ash!</i>
5112773 5115526 Yes, I can hear you.
5119989 5125536 - What was your Special Order?<br />- You read it. I thought it was clear.
5125620 5129624 - What was it?<br />- Bring back life-form.
5129707 5134378 Priority one.<br />All other priorities rescinded.
5137381 5142094 The damn company! What about our lives,<br />you son of a bitch?
5142178 5146140 I repeat... All other priorities<br />are rescinded.
5146223 5148601 <i>How do we kill it, Ash?</i>
5148684 5152104 <i>There's got to be a way of killing it.<br />How-How do we do it?</i>
5152188 5154982 You can't.
5155066 5156571 That's bullshit!
5156871 5160571 You still don't understand what<br />you're dealing with, do you?
5162031 5164533 A perfect organism.
5167328 5170956 Its structural perfection is<br />matched only by its hostility.
5171040 5173209 You admire it.
5177338 5179423 I admire its purity.
5183761 5185680 A survivor...
5187765 5192019 unclouded... by conscience,
5192103 5195731 remorse or delusions<br />of morality.
5197733 5200403 <i>Look, I-I've heard<br />enough of this...</i>
5200486 5202905 and I'm asking you to pull the plug.
5202988 5206325 - <i>Last word.</i><br />- What?
5208160 5212206 I can't lie to you<br />about your chances, but...
5215376 5217878 you have my sympathies.
5220297 5223342 We're gonna blow up the ship.
5223426 5226220 We'll take our chances<br />in the shuttle.
5226303 5228639 - Blow up the ship.<br />- Good.
5228723 5230725 Come on.
5257251 5261046 - When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows?<br />- <i>Ten minutes.</i>
5261172 5263340 - No bullshit.<br />- If we ain't outta here in ten minutes,
5263424 5267094 we won't need no rocket<br />to fly through space.
5267178 5270347 We're gonna need coolant<br />for the air support system.
5282693 5285362 You two go down, get all<br />the coolant you can carry.
5285446 5288365 I'll get the shuttle ready.<br />I'll give you about...
5288449 5290743 about seven minutes.
5290826 5293204 Come back up here.<br />I'll shut the switches off,
5293287 5295164 and we'll blow this fucker<br />off into space.
5295247 5296957 Okay. All right.<br />Come on.
5297041 5298667 - Ready?<br />- Take care of yourself.
5298751 5300419 Seven minutes.
5337623 5340209 <i>Take it easy.</i>
5343254 5346715 Jones.
5393596 5395598 Jones?
5429381 5431759 Okay, check the bottles.
5444939 5446941 Jones?
5451445 5452905 - How you doin'?<br />- Fine.
5454323 5455991 Kitty.
5456075 5458035 <i>Okay. Go ahead.</i>
5460204 5462331 Jones?
5466543 5469296 Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!<br />Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!
5469380 5471757 Come here, Jones.<br />Come here.
5471840 5473968 Jones?
5478305 5480224 Come here, boy.
5480307 5482101 Come here.
5482184 5484603 Nice kitty.
5484687 5486647 Jones?
5486730 5489400 Jones?
5493487 5496281 Come here.<br />Come here, sweetheart.
5497533 5499326 Jones.
5506542 5510421 Jones? Jones?
5512172 5514258 Jones?
5519096 5521932 Jones!<br />Goddamn it!
5525936 5528063 Now I got you.
5533235 5536155 Here, sweetie.<br />Nice kitty.
5556967 5560846 Oh, my God.
5560971 5564391 - <i>Get out of the way.<br />- I can't get out of the way!</i>
5564475 5567311 <i>Get out of the way, Lambert!<br />It's gonna kill us!</i>
5567394 5570147 <i>I can't!</i>
5570272 5573400 - <i>Lambert, for Christ's sake, get out of the way!</i><br />- Lamber--
5582659 5586163 Get out of the way, Lambert!
5586246 5588165 Parker? Lambert?
5588248 5592419 Lambert? Lamber--? Parker?
5621782 5624118 Get outta the room!
5642469 5647391 <i>Oh, God!</i>
5662114 5664241 Parker?
5757251 5761755 - <i>Danger. The emergency destruct system</i>
5761838 5764174 <i>is now activated.</i>
5764258 5767427 <i>The ship will detonate in T-minus...</i>
