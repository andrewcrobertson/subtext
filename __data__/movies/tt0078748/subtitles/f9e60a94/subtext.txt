409703 414624 The food is terrible.<br />Worst shit I've ever seen, man.
414708 417168 - <i>What you say?</i><br />- You got any biscuits over there?
417252 419587 <i>I keep seeing corn bread.</i>
422341 424801 - I am cold.<br />- Still with us, Brett?
424885 429263 - Right.<br />- Oh, I feel dead.
429348 432225 Anybody ever tell you<br />you look dead, man?
434645 437146 <i>Oh, yeah, right.</i>
437231 439315 Now, I just forgot something, man.
439399 441359 Uh, before we dock,
441443 443444 I think we oughta discuss<br />the bonus situation.
443570 445571 - Right.<br />- Brett and I, we think we oughta--
445656 448032 - We deserve full shares, right, baby?<br />- You see, Mr. Parker and I
448117 451744 feel that the bonus situation has<br />never been on an, an equitable level.
451829 455081 Well, you'll get what you're<br />contracted for like everybody else.
455207 457542 Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.
457626 459794 Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.
459878 463297 Huh? Yeah, I saw it.<br />Yellow light's for my eyes only.
464716 466467 Okay, get dressed, huh?
466593 470012 - Parker, come on.<br />- Can I finish my coffee? Thank you.
470097 472157 It's the only thing good on this ship.
519888 522398 <i>Morning, Mother.</i>
551970 555181 - Right.<br />- Okay.
555265 557600 Plug us in.
558810 560570 Thank you.
564191 567526 - Where's Earth?<br />- You should know.
567611 570780 It's not our system.
570864 571405 Scan.
574826 577828 I can't believe this.
577913 580665 Contact Traffic Control.
581249 585628 <i>This is commercial towing vehicle</i><br />Nostromo <i>out of the Solomons.</i>

611238 615741 I found it. Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.
615867 621330 - We haven't reached the outer rim yet.<br />- That's hard to believe.
621415 624459 <i>What the hell are we<br />doing out here?</i>
625544 628295 I don't know. What the hell<br />are you talking about?
628380 631757 - That's not our system.<br />- I know that.
631883 635970 <i>Listen, do you ever notice<br />how they never come down here?</i>
636054 638180 <i>I mean, this is where<br />the work is, right?</i>
638265 640933 <i>Well, it's the same damn reason<br />we get a half share to their one.</i>
641018 643060 <i>Our time is their time.<br />That's the way they see it.</i>
643186 645104 - <i>No, but--<br />- Listen, man. Same old shit, man.</i>
645188 647314 <i>I think I know why they<br />don't come down here.</i>
647399 649900 <i>It's because of you.<br />You don't have no personality.</i>
651903 654697 <i>Wonder what they want now.<br />What's going on down here?</i>
657367 660453 - Um, you happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?<br />- Yes, of course.
660579 663197 - Thank you.<br />- Sorry.
668086 669887 <i>What's happenin' now, baby?</i>
671923 676135 Well... some of you may have<br />figured out we're not home yet.
676219 678596 - We're only halfway there.<br />- What?
678680 682058 Mother's interrupted<br />the course of our journey.
682142 684060 - Why?<br />- Yeah.
684070 687188 She's programmed to do that should<br />certain conditions arise. They have.
687314 690316 - <i>Like what?</i><br />- It seems she has...
690400 692610 intercepted a transmission<br />of unknown origin.
692736 695946 - <i>She got us up to check it out.</i><br />- A transmission? Out here?
696031 698783 - <i>Yeah.</i><br />- What kind of a transmission?
698867 702495 Acoustical beacon. It repeats<br />at intervals of 12 seconds.
702621 704497 - S.O.S.?<br />- I don't know.
704581 706499 Human?
706625 709460 - Unknown.<br />- <i>Well, so what?</i>
709544 711670 <i>We are obligated under section 8--</i>
711755 714048 I hate to bring this up, but, uh,
714132 716467 this is a commercial ship,<br />not a rescue ship.
716593 720012 - Right.<br />- And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty.
720138 724016 And what about the money? If you wanna give<br />me some money to do it, I'll be happy to oblige.
724142 726435 - The man's right.<br />- Let's go over the bonus situation.
727820 730439 - I'm sorry. Can I say something?<br />- <i>Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>
730524 733150 There is a clause in the contract<br />which specifically states
733235 736703 any systematized transmission indicating<br />a possible intelligent origin
736805 737675 must be investigated.
737677 739375 - <i>I don't wanna hear it.<br />- We don't know if it's intelligent.</i>
739381 740449 <i>I wanna go home and party.</i>
740534 742827 Parker, will you just listen to the man?!
745038 749542 On penalty of total forfeiture of shares.<br />No money.
750919 752503 You got that?
752587 756340 - Well... yeah.<br />- All right, we're going in.
756424 758342 Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?
765350 767017 Can we all hear that, Lambert?
789833 791792 Good God.
791877 794253 Doesn't sound like any<br />radio signal <i>I've</i> heard.
794379 796547 Maybe it's a voice.<br />Well, we'll soon know.
796631 798716 Can you hone in on that?
799843 802553 What was the, uh, position?
802637 806432 <i>6-5-5-0... dash 9-9.</i>
811229 814106 All right. I found the quadrant.

822782 824950 Okay. Put that on the screen for me.
829497 831332 <i>All right. Well, that's it.</i>
831416 834835 It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometers.
835120 837863 - <i>It's tiny.<br />- Any rotation?</i>
840225 842343 <i>About two hours.</i>
842427 843862 What about gravity?
845846 847323 Point eight-six.

1010802 1012424 <i>How's that pressure reading?

1125184 1126087 Is the hull breached?
1126287 1129087 I don't see anything.<br />We've still got pressure.
1129162 1130658 Hit the screen.
1131958 1132758 Right.

1161537 1163872 Dry dock. Tell her we<br />need to dry dock.
1163957 1165874 Look, we couldn't fix it<br />out here anyway.
1165959 1167876 We gotta reroute all these ducts and,
1167961 1170587 in order to do that<br />we've got to dry dock.
1170672 1172923 What else?
1173007 1174925 <i>Some fragments kicked up, and</i>
1175009 1177386 <i>we've got to clean it all out<br />and, uh, repressurize it.</i>
1177470 1179846 <i>How long before we're functional?</i>
1179973 1184393 - Look, what is...? What--<br />- It's 17 hours, tell her.
1184519 1187312 - At least 25 hours.<br />- Yeah.
1187397 1189773 <i>Get started on the floor panel.<br />I'll be right down.</i>
1189857 1191900 What the hell's she comin' down here for?
1191985 1194069 She better stay the fuck out of my way,<br />I'll tell you that.
1194153 1196622 <i>I'd like to see what she's<br />gonna do when she gets here.</i>

1208585 1210585 <i>No. Absolutely nothing.</i>
1210670 1213439 <i>Except the same transmission<br />every 12 seconds.</i>
1213923 1215924 <i>All the other channels are dead.</i>
1221014 1224016 Kick on the floods.
1238698 1242034 - We can't go anywhere in this.<br />- Mmm.
1242618 1244911 Well, Mother says the sun's<br />coming up in 20 minutes.
1245038 1248373 - How far are we from the source of transmission?<br />- Uh, northeast.
1248458 1250876 Just under 2,000 meters.
1250960 1253062 Walking distance?
1253546 1256089 Well--
1256215 1259343 - Can you give me an atmospheric?<br />- Yes.
1262388 1264389 <i>Oh.</i>
1265725 1267809 It's almost primordial.
1268294 1269895 <i>There's inert nitrogen,</i>

1290166 1291618 <i>Yeah, that figures.</i>
1293002 1294396 <i>You too, Lambert.</i>
1295922 1296724 Swell.
1297424 1298824 <i>Better break out the weapons.</i>

1405698 1406533 Hey, Ripley.
1408618 1410702 Hey, Ripley, I wanna ask you a question.
1413080 1416154 If they find what they're lookin' for out there,<br />does that mean we get full shares?
1416158 1420212 Don't worry, Parker, yeah.<br />You'll get whatever's coming to you.
1420296 1422839 Look, I'm not gonna do<br />any more work...
1422924 1425842 - till we get this straightened out.<br />- <i>Brett,</i>
1425968 1429554 - you're guaranteed by law to get a share.<br />- <i>What?</i>
1429639 1432807 - Why don't you just fuck off.<br />- What?
1433392 1435310 <i>What'd you say, Rip?</i>
1435394 1439064 If you have any trouble,<br />I'll be on the bridge.
1440483 1442993 <i>Hey, Ripley, come back here!</i>
1448157 1451159 - Son of a bitch.<br />- What's the matter?
1461170 1463880 <i>Can't see a goddamn thing.</i>
1463965 1466716 - <i>Quit griping.<br />- I like griping.</i>
1466801 1468743 <i>Come on. Knock it off!</i>
1553628 1555146 <i>Ash, can you see this?</i>
1555930 1557240 Yes, I can.
1560269 1561928 I've never seen anything like it.
1571797 1573657 <i>Very bizarre.</i>
1576952 1578795 <i>You said it.</i>
1587672 1590048 <i>All right...</i>
1590132 1592834 <i>Moving on to second...<br />position.</i>
1593018 1594045 <i>What is it?</i>
1597431 1598840 <i>Let's get out of here.</i>
1599225 1601893 <i>We've got this far.<br />We must go on!</i>
1601977 1603637 <i>We have to go on!</i>
1607191 1608760 Will you say that again?
1609960 1611060 Shit.
1612321 1616116 <i>Ash, as you can see,<br />it's kind of hard to describe.</i>
1616200 1618910 I'm going back to the console.
1633801 1636052 <i>Seems to be solid.</i>
1636137 1638722 <i>To walk... You can on it.</i>
1666266 1667410 Dallas?
1720304 1722514 <i>Come on down here.<br />Something different down here.</i>
1723974 1726392 I don't know what it is, but...
1726477 1729854 See if we can get up that wall.<br />If we can get up that wall, we can find out.
1796780 1797961 <i>Amazing.</i>
1798265 1800333 <i>Alien life form.</i>
1802386 1804796 <i>Looks like it's been dead a long time.</i>
1805380 1806599 <i>Fossilized.</i>
1808183 1811069 <i>Looks like it's grown out of the chair.</i>
1818455 1819655 <i>Oh.</i>
1821655 1823781 <i>Bones are bent outward...</i>
1823866 1826910 <i>like he exploded from inside.</i>
1828829 1831164 <i>Wonder what happened<br />to the rest of the crew.</i>
1836544 1838530 <i>Let's get the hell out of here.</i>
1850768 1853889 <i>Hey, Dallas...<br />Lambert, come on over here.</i>
1857024 1858401 <i>Come on.</i>
1863030 1865704 - <i>What do you got?<br />- See what you make of this.</i>
1873582 1875500 Ash.
1875584 1879073 <i>That transmission...<br />Mother's deciphered part of it.</i>
1879088 1881547 - <i>It doesn't look like an S.O.S.</i><br />- Well, what is it, then?
1881632 1884768 Well, I--<br />It looks like a warning.
1885052 1887637 - <i>I'm gonna go out after them.</i><br />- What's the point?
1890599 1893388 I mean, by the t-time it<br />takes to get there, you'll,
1893400 1895770 <i>they'll know if it's<br />a warning or not, yes?</i>
1923340 1925383 <i>You okay down there?</i>
1929680 1932982 - <i>Can you see anything?<br />- I dunno... a cave.</i>
1933934 1936894 <i>A ca-- a cave of some sort.<br />But I...</i>
1939064 1941858 <i>Well, I don't know, but it's like<br />the goddamn tropics in here.</i>
1944194 1947121 <i>What the hell is this?</i>
1974892 1977852 <i>The cave is completely enclosed...</i>
1977936 1980313 <i>and it's full of...</i>
1980397 1984033 <i>leathery objects, like...<br />eggs or something.</i>
2002344 2004504 <i>There's a-a layer of mist...</i>
2004588 2008633 <i>just covering the eggs<br />that reacts when broken.</i>
2011804 2014764 <i>Kane? You all right?</i>
2014848 2017391 <i>Yeah, I'm okay. All right.</i>
2019603 2021371 <i>I'm okay. I just slipped.</i>
2042267 2044877 Appears to be completely sealed.
2079830 2081223 <i>Wait a minute, there's movement.</i>
2083917 2087070 <i>It seems to have life...<br />organic life.
2152110 2154528 <i>- You there, Ripley?</i><br />- I'm right here.
2161203 2163321 Okay, Ripley, I'm at the<br />inner lock hatch now.
2163321 2164321 <i>Right.</i>
2173966 2175717 <i>- Okay, Ripley.<br />- Right here.</i>
2175717 2176717 <i>We're clean. Let us in.</i>
2176802 2179453 - What happened to Kane?<br />- Something has attached itself to him.
2179478 2181402 We have to get him to<br />the infirmary right away.
2181482 2183502 What kind of "thing"?<br />I need a clear definition.
2183508 2185609 An organism. Open the hatch!
2185644 2188262 Wait a minute. If we let it in,<br />the ship could be infected.
2188296 2191941 You know the quarantine procedure.<br />24 hours for decontamination.
2192025 2193901 He could die in 24 hours.<br />Open the hatch!
2193986 2196821 Listen to me. If we break<br />quarantine, we could all die.
2196905 2200984 <i>Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?<br />We have to get him inside!</i>
2203161 2204829 No. I can't do that.
2204913 2207031 <i>And if you were in my position,<br />you'd do the same.</i>
2207096 2209292 Ripley, this is an order!<br />Open that hatch right now, do you hear me?
2209818 2211294 <i>Yes.</i>
2211378 2213421 <i>Ripley, this is an order!<br />Do you hear me?</i>
2213505 2217100 Yes, I read you.<br />The answer is negative.
2219786 2221045 Inner hatch opened.
2249440 2250842 My God.
2261178 2263062 What the hell is that?
2264556 2267933 Jesus... Christ.
2269895 2272188 What is that, man?
2273982 2276317 Hey, how the hell is he breathing?
2276401 2278019 Is he still alive or what?
2278403 2281363 And why don't you guys freeze him?
2281448 2283149 How come they don't freeze him?
2283533 2285493 W-what's going on in there?
2285577 2287912 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- You bitch!
2287996 2290456 Jesus Christ!<br />Hey! Hey!
2290540 2292792 - You would've left us out there.<br />- Break it up.
2292876 2297379 <i>All right. Ripley, when I give<br />an order, I expect to be obeyed.</i>
2297464 2300966 - Even if it's against the law?<br />- <i>You're goddamn right!</i>
2301051 2303904 Well, maybe she has a point, you know.<br />Who the hell knows what that thing is.
2303929 2306722 How are we gonna get that off him?
2306848 2310267 - How are we gonna get it off?<br />- I'm gonna get some instruments.
2314314 2316232 My God.
2318735 2322488 Right.<br />I'll make an incision here.
2322614 2328035 - <i>Try and remove one of the digitals from--</i><br />- You're gonna do what?
2328120 2331205 <i>Finger. I'm gonna try and get<br />his finger off. Just a minute.</i>
2336503 2340131 - <i>No, that's not-- It's tearing his scalp.<br />- I know!</i>
2340215 2344210 It's not coming off without<br />tearing his face off with it.
2344594 2346428 - We'll have to take a look at him inside.<br />- Right.
2349975 2352726 How come they don't freeze him?
2352811 2355729 <i>How come you guys don't freeze him?</i>
2371371 2373531 All right, you can take your mask off.
2392350 2394272 What's it got down his throat?
2394272 2396272 <i>I would suggest it's<br />feeding him oxygen.</i>
2398056 2399860 Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma...
2401860 2402860 then keeps him alive.
2402944 2404479 Now what the hell is that?
2405706 2406723 Oh, we gotta get it off of him.
2406838 2408825 Just a minute. Just a minute.
2409910 2411869 I mean, let's not be too hasty.
2412454 2414422 We don't know anything about...
2414706 2416165 <i>it.</i>
2416350 2419960 Now, we're assuming it's feeding<br />him oxygen, if we remove it...
2421213 2423014 it could kill him.
2425800 2428071 I'm willing to take that chance.<br />Let's cut it off him now.
2428094 2429047 You'll take responsibility?
2429147 2432047 Yes, yes, I'll take responsibility.<br />Now get him out of there.
2433558 2435284 <i>Where do you wanna do this?</i>
2435769 2438938 We'll make an incision<br />just below the knuckle there.
2439064 2440689 - Right here.<br />- <i>Stand by.</i>
2449491 2450492 <i>Good God!</i>
2451092 2452092 <i>Jesus.</i>
2455413 2457407 <i>That crap's gonna<br />eat through the hull.</i>
2460126 2462419 That thing's gonna eat through<br />the goddamn hull! Come on!
2462504 2463847 <i>What's going on?</i>
2465131 2466132 This way.
2475667 2476851 <i>Next deck.</i>
2495187 2496087 <i>There it is.</i>
2498498 2500457 Don't get under it!<br />Don't get under it.
2506298 2507794 Looks like it's stopping.
2511177 2513095 - Take a look at this, man.<br />- Yeah.
2513179 2516224 Brett, give me, uh, what do you got, a pen there?<br />Give it to me, quick.
2516808 2517808 <i>Come on! Come on!</i>
2523856 2525316 <i>Don't get any on your arm.</i>
2533024 2534426 It stopped.
2535410 2537455 Don't see anything like that except, uh...
2538355 2539455 <i>molecular acid.</i>
2539539 2541624 It must be using it for blood.
2542709 2544626 It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
2544911 2546720 <i>You don't dare kill it.</i>
2547005 2548181 What about Kane?
2550842 2552303 Here's your pen back.
2553303 2554303 <i>What do we do now?</i>
2554387 2557214 <i>Leave Kane to Ash.<br />You get back to work.</i>
2559726 2561643 Well, what--
2570428 2571863 Okay.
2572989 2576266 Try it.
2579913 2581914 Damn it.<br />I thought sure that was it.
2582040 2585292 Try it again.
2585377 2588003 I feel like I've been<br />in this place a month.
2589464 2592049 We shouldn't have landed in<br />this place in the first place.
2593718 2596671 Shouldn't have landed on this<br />damn ball, I know that.
2598056 2602809 Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and<br />get out of here, the sooner we can go home.
2602893 2604627 This place gives me the creeps.
2667917 2670461 <i>That's amazing. What is it?</i>
2672005 2675215 Ah, yes, it is.<br />Um...
2675300 2677426 I don't know yet.
2680221 2683098 Did you want something?
2683183 2685476 <i>Yes. I, uh...</i>
2687270 2690189 <i>I'd like to have a little talk.<br />How's, uh... how's Kane?</i>
2690273 2692858 He's holding. No changes.
2692942 2697271 <i>And, uh... our guest?</i>
2697697 2700616 - Mmm.<br />- <i>Hmm?</i>
2700700 2702576 Well, as I said, I'm still...
2702660 2704620 collating, actually, but, uh,
2704704 2708749 I have confirmed that he's got an outer<br />layer of protein polysaccharides.
2710502 2712794 He has a funny habit<br />of shedding his cells
2712879 2716715 and replacing them with<br />polarized silicon...
2716799 2718926 which gives him a prolonged resistance
2719010 2722930 to adverse environmental conditions.
2723056 2724157 Is that enough for you?
2724357 2726157 <i>That's plenty.<br />What does it mean?</i>
2727183 2728635 Please don't do that. Thank you.
2728680 2729763 <i>I'm sorry.</i>
2731648 2733565 Well, it's an interesting<br />combination of elements,
2733650 2737895 making him a... tough little son of a bitch.
2738279 2740456 And you let him in.
2740740 2743116 I was obeying a direct order, remember?
2743201 2747287 Ash, when Dallas and Kane<br />are off the ship,
2747372 2749456 <i>I'm</i> Senior Officer.
2749541 2752017 <i>Oh, yes. I forgot.</i>
2752502 2756221 You also forgot the Science<br />Division's Basic Quarantine Law.
2756347 2758215 - No, that I didn't forget.<br />- Oh, I see.
2758299 2760968 You just broke it, huh?
2761052 2764680 Look, what would you<br />have done with Kane? Hmm?
2764764 2768058 You knew his only chance of<br />survival was to get him in here.
2768142 2770561 <i>Unfortunately, by, uh,<br />breaking quarantine,</i>
2770645 2772604 <i>you risk everybody's life.</i>
2772689 2775774 Maybe I should've left him outside.
2775858 2779695 Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,<br />but it was a risk I was willing to take.
2779779 2781947 That's a pretty big risk...
2782031 2783949 for a Science Officer.
2784033 2787411 It's, uh, not exactly<br />out of the manual, is it?
2788830 2792249 I <i>do</i> take my responsibilities<br />as seriously as you, you know.
2793418 2795335 <i>You do your job...</i>
2795420 2797546 and let me do mine, yes?
2816924 2820861 - <i>Where's Dallas?<br />- In the shuttle.</i>
2825950 2826993 Dallas.
2827002 2828493 <i>I think you should<br />have a look at Kane.</i>
2829320 2830623 Why?
2830623 2832623 <i>Something's happened.</i>
2832749 2833751 Serious?
2833751 2835751 <i>Interesting.</i>
2840298 2842257 Ripley, meet me in the<br />infirmary right away.
2846587 2848347 <i>Where is it?</i>
2848431 2851770 <i>Well, I don't know. I mean,<br />we ought to try and find it.</i>
2851771 2853268 <i>Yeah, let's check it.</i>
2879921 2882214 Dallas, please be careful.
2920545 2922371 <i>Oh!</i>
2923256 2924232 Sorry.
2957457 2961668 No, not in the corner.<br />Psst. Have one of these.
2963254 2965172 <i>Just in case.</i>
2977602 2981104 Kane? Dallas?
2985234 2986403 You okay?
2986710 2988403 <i>I didn't see it.<br />Was it in the overhead?</i>
2988529 2992282 - What? It was up there somewhere.<br />- My God.
2992408 2995535 - <i>Cover up the damn thing, will ya?<br />- Wait.</i>
2995620 2996820 That's alive!
2998206 3000207 That's a reflex action.
3002226 3004044 Well, we've gotta<br />have a look at this.
3016632 3018099 Excuse me.
3024732 3027784 - <i>Seems dead enough.<br />- Well, good! Let's get rid of it.</i>
3029028 3031530 Ripley...<br />for God's sake,
3031614 3035033 this is the first time that we've<br />encountered a species like this.
3035117 3037661 It has to go back. All sorts<br />of tests have to be made.
3037745 3040205 Ash, are you kidding?<br />This thing bled acid.
3040289 3043041 Who knows what it's<br />gonna do when it's dead.
3043125 3046336 Think it's safe to assume<br />it isn't a zombie.
3046420 3049089 Dallas, it has to go back.
3049173 3051675 Well, I'd soon...
3051759 3054545 as not burn it at the stake,<br />but you're the Science Officer.
3054545 3056979 - It's your decision, Ash.<br />- Dallas.
3057098 3059475 How come I've got to change my mind, all right?<br />The decision's been made.
3059475 3061893 I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.<br />I just want you to listen.
3061978 3063895 Will you listen to--?
3066274 3068525 <i>Just tell me how you can leave<br />that kind of decision to him.</i>
3068609 3070410 Look, I just run the ship!
3070495 3073154 Anything that has to do with the<br />Science Division, <i>Ash</i> has the final word.
3073281 3074575 How does that happen?
3074575 3076645 It happens, my dear, because that's<br />what the company <i>wants</i> to happen.
3076659 3079149 Since when is that standard procedure?
3079153 3082038 Standard procedure is to do what<br />the hell they tell you to do.
3082164 3083917 <i>What's happening with the repairs?<br />How's it going?</i>
3083918 3085917 Oh, they're pretty much finished now.
3086002 3087819 <i>Why the hell didn't you tell me so?</i>
3087824 3089589 Well, because there's still<br />some things left to do.
3089589 3090589 Like what?
3090673 3093049 <i>Well... we're blind<br />on "B" and "C" decks.</i>
3093175 3094711 <i>The-The reserve power system's blown--</i>
3094711 3096011 Oh, no, no, that's a bunch of horseshit.
3096137 3097264 We can take off without that.
3097264 3099264 <i>Yeah, we can.<br />You think that's a good idea?</i>
3099348 3102225 Look, I just wanna get the<br />hell out of here, all right?
3126417 3129044 Dust in the intakes again.<br />Number 2's overheating.
3129128 3131821 Spit on it for two minutes,<br />would you, for Christ's sake?
3132923 3134858 <i>We're hot.<br />We're getting hotter.</i>
3138012 3140340 <i>Engine room, red clip status?</i>
3141766 3145727 - One kilometer on ascension.<br />- <i>Engage artificial gravity.</i>
3145811 3149397 - <i>Engaged.</i><br />- I'm altering the vector... now.
3153736 3157837 <i>Inhibit C.N.G. control<br />upward to T.A.C.S.</i>
3157837 3159020 <i>Inhibit C.N.G.--</i>
3159024 3163662 - Struts retract.<br />- <i>kStruts retracted.</i>
3163746 3165874 <i>Max stress to fifth overload.</i>
3167558 3168818 <i>Ease it back.</i>
3171545 3173588 <i>She's great. Beautiful.</i>
3185059 3188186 Walk in the park. When we fix<br />something, we stay fixed.
3188270 3191106 - <i>Don't we, Brett, baby?<br />- Right.</i>
3206414 3208373 <i>What I think we should do<br />is just freeze him.</i>
3208457 3210709 I mean, if he's got a disease,<br />why don't we stop it where it is?
3210793 3214201 - He can always get to a doctor when we get back home.<br />- Right.
3214201 3218174 Whenever he says <i>anything</i>, you say "right", Brett.<br />You know that?
3218300 3220351 Right.
3220353 3223430 Parker, what do you think? Your staff<br />just follows you around, and says "right."
3223514 3225932 - Just like a regular parrot.<br />- Yeah, shape up.
3226016 3228414 - What are you, some kind of parrot?<br />- Right.
3228415 3230305 Oh, come on, knock it off!
3230405 3232805 Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.<br />That's it!
3232809 3234383 Yes, and so will we.
3235067 3237318 Well, how about a little something<br />to lower your spirits?
3237403 3238887 Thrill me, will you, please?
3239572 3241410 Well, according to my calculations,
3241410 3243491 based on time spent getting<br />to and from the planet--
3243617 3245870 Just give me the short version.<br />How far to Earth?
3246170 3247950 - Ten months.<br />- Oh, God.
3247954 3248372 Great.
3250290 3251090 Yes?
3251175 3253001 <i>Dallas, I think you should<br />come and see Kane.</i>
3253002 3255044 Has his condition changed?
3255044 3256327 <i>It's simpler if you'd<br />just come and see him.</i>
3256329 3257529 <i>We're on our way.</i>
3259925 3262594 Right.
3264972 3267048 <i>How are you doing?</i>
3269727 3272395 - Thank you.<br />- <i>How you doin'?</i>
3272480 3274689 Um, terrific.<br />Next silly question.
3278277 3280020 Oh, thank you.
3282364 3284991 Do you remember anything<br />about the planet?
3287912 3290330 What's the last thing<br />you <i>do</i> remember?
3291874 3294083 Huh?
3297254 3299172 I remember some...
3299256 3301925 horrible dream about...<br />smothering.
3302009 3303802 And--
3303886 3306387 And-- Anyway,<br />where are we?
3306514 3308848 - Right here.<br />- We're on our way home.
3308853 3311017 Yeah, back to the old freezerinos.
3313187 3315355 Could I have something to eat<br />before we go back?
3315439 3317273 I-I need something myself.
3317358 3320985 Yeah, right. One more meal<br />before bedtime. I'm buyin'.
3321111 3324155 - Hey, that's a break.<br />- <i>Bedtime.</i>
3343926 3346469 The first thing that I'm<br />gonna do when I get back
3346554 3348555 is to... get some decent food.
3348639 3351249 I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,<br />I've eaten worse food than this, but,
3351475 3352822 then I've tasted better,<br />you know what I'm sayin'?
3352843 3354143 <i>The other one over there.</i>
3354450 3357114 Well, you pound down the stuff<br />like there's no tomorrow.
3357198 3361492 Listen, I'd rather be eatin' something else,<br />but, uh... right now I'm thinkin' food.
3362076 3364696 <i>Well, you should know.<br />You know what it's made of.</i>
3364780 3367824 No, man, I don't wanna talk about<br />what it's made of.
3367950 3369909 I'm eatin' this just to--
3371287 3372672 What's the matter?
3372689 3375498 - The food ain't <i>that</i> bad, baby.<br />- What's wrong, Kane?
3376224 3377542 Are you choking?</i>
3377626 3379502 What's wrong?
3381297 3382464 What's wrong?
3382797 3383564 What? What?
3383569 3384793 This is serious.
3385597 3386593 Kane, what's the matter?
3388680 3389580 It's okay!
3389864 3394192 - <i>Get a spoon in his mouth. Now!</i><br />- Hold him down. Hold him--
3396276 3397603 <i>Get the spoon in!</i>
3398687 3400273 Dammit!
3400399 3402650 - Get it into his mouth!<br />- I'm trying!
3432514 3434690 <i>Oh, my God!</i>
3442524 3444567 No! Don't touch it!<br />Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
3461168 3463094 <i>Dallas?</i>
3463320 3464664 <i>Dallas?</i>
3465269 3466064 <i>Yeah.</i>
3466090 3469426 - <i>Anything?<br />- No. You?</i>
3470010 3472045 <i>Nothing.</i>
3472471 3475056 - <i>You see anything?<br />- No.</i>
3496546 3498126 <i>Inner hatch sealed.</i>
3502150 3504093 <i>Anybody wanna say anything?</i>
3540789 3544250 This is just an ordinary prod,<br />like a cattle prod.
3544334 3546252 It's got a portable battery,
3546336 3549047 <i>it's insulated all the way here,<br />all the way up to here.</i>
3549131 3552091 Just make damn sure nobody puts<br />their hand on the end of it.
3555637 3557555 <i>It shouldn't damage the little bastard,</i>
3557639 3560141 unless its skin's thinner than ours.
3560225 3564395 But... it will give him<br />a little incentive.
3564480 3566481 Now we just have to find it.
3566565 3570401 I've taken care of that.<br />I've designed this... tracking device.
3570486 3574606 You just set it to search for<br />a moving object, like so.
3574990 3577492 <i>Hasn't got much of a range, but when<br />you get within a certain distance,</i>
3577576 3579619 <i>it'll start to give off a signal.</i>
3579703 3581199 What's it key on?
3582873 3586626 Micro changes in air density.
3586710 3588287 Give me a demo.
3590756 3594425 <i>See? Again.</i>
3594510 3596844 Got ya.
3596929 3600431 Two teams.<br />Ash, Lambert and I.
3600516 3603935 Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.
3604019 3606521 Now, anyone see this thing,<br />you catch it in the net...
3606605 3608731 that Parker's holding on his lap.
3608816 3611734 Parker, I don't want any<br />heroics out of you, all right?
3611819 3615238 <i>Catch it, put it in<br />the air lock, get rid of it.</i>
3615322 3617198 <i>Now, channels are open on all decks.</i>
3617282 3621410 I want you to communicate, keep in<br />touch at all times, all right?
3621495 3622896 Let's go.
3628043 3629710 <i>I thought you fixed 12 module.</i>
3630695 3631963 <i>We did.</i>
3632947 3634090 <i>I don't understand it.</i>
3637218 3639311 <i>The circuits must have burned out.</i>
3652116 3652751 <i>What do we got here?</i>
3652855 3654851 <i>Dammit! Hold your light<br />over here, would you?
3654855 3656153 <i>Yeah, that's it.</i>
3657338 3660199 - <i>I don't know if this is going to work.<br />- Right.</i>
3660284 3663390 <i>Oh. If I could just put this--<br />put this in there.</i>
3663395 3665746 - <i>Right.<br />- Oh, dammit.</i>
3669659 3671419 <i>Check the insulation.</i>
3671903 3673421 <i>Oh, shit!</i>
3696477 3699155 - Steady.<br />- According to this, it's within five meters.
3704119 3706954 <i>Micro changes in air density, my ass.</i>
3712669 3715129 <i>It's within five meters.</i>
3715213 3717048 <i>Be careful.</i>
3726942 3729060 - <i>Christ.<br />- Don't do that. Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>
3729065 3730738 <i>You guys, stick together.</i>
3747913 3751624 - Don't fail me now.<br />- <i>What?</i>
3751750 3753700 - What is it?<br />- Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
3753702 3754820 Where?
3756004 3758005 Here, here, take this.</i>
3758090 3760508 Get over there and get the net.
3760634 3763219 - Got it?<br />- I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
3763803 3765888 Wait a minute.<br />Wait a minute!
3767241 3770085 All right, Parker.<br />When I say...
3772487 3774271 All right, now!
3774356 3775357 Easy.
3780028 3782655 Wait! Don't let him go!
3782739 3784949 What the hell are you doing, man!?
3785033 3786951 It's the cat, man.
3793417 3796293 Hey, look, now.<br />We had to bag it, man.
3796378 3798088 Now we might pick it up<br />on the tracker again.
3799715 3801966 - I'll-I'll-I'll--<br />- Go and get it, man.
3802968 3805085 All right. You get him.<br />We'll go on.
3816158 3817616 Here, kitty!
3818900 3820277 Here, kitty, kitty!
3821361 3823288 Enough of that kitty crap.
3823672 3824992 Jones?
3828076 3829594 Jonesy?
3830078 3831679 Here, Jonesy!
3839838 3841456 Jonesy?
3846928 3849263 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
3855771 3857147 Here, Jonesy.
3869951 3871827 Jonesy?
3883090 3885057 Here, kitty, kitty.
3972470 3974055 Kitty, kitty, kitty.
3976808 3978643 Here, Jonesy.
3979227 3981228 Jonesy.
3983481 3985482 Kitty, kitty.
4019142 4021352 Kitty, kitty, kitty.
4025065 4026766 Jonesy?
4034074 4036909 Hey. Hey.<br />Come on, Jonesy.
4036993 4039286 Come on, baby.<br />That's a kitty.
4039371 4042748 <i>That's a kitty.<br />Come on, baby.</i>
4042832 4045626 That's a kitty.
4046410 4049588 Hey, hey.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you.
4049673 4051674 <i>Come on.</i>
4082121 4083038 Brett!
4083123 4085457 <i>Brett!</i>
4092716 4095301 <i>Brett!</i>
4104019 4107195 Whatever it was, it was--<br />it was big and--
4110317 4112209 You're sure it took him<br />into the air shaft?
4112294 4114442 Disappeared into<br />one of the cooling ducts.
4114446 4118181 No question, it's...<br />it's using the air ducts to move around.
4121411 4123579 Could he want Brett alive?
4124714 4127244 - What?<br />- Could Brett be alive?
4127267 4130336 No. I mean...<br />I don't think so.
4130420 4134340 Well, this air shaft may<br />work to our advantage.
4134424 4138719 Here it leads up to and comes out<br />in the main air lock.
4139304 4141597 All right, there's only one<br />big opening along the way.
4141681 4145017 We can cover that up,<br />and then we...
4145101 4147603 drive it into the air lock<br />and zap it into outer space.
4147687 4150064 This son of a bitch is <i>huge!</i>
4150148 4153525 - <i>I mean, it's like a man. It's big!</i><br />- Kane's son.
4155945 4158489 Come on, Ash. I mean, Science Department<br />should be able to help us.
4158490 4160866 What can we do to drive it?
4160950 4163343 Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably<br />well to our atmosphere,
4163343 4165412 considering its nutritional requirements.
4165538 4168082 - The only thing we don't know about is temperature.<br />- Okay. What about temperature?
4168166 4170876 - What happens if we change it?<br />- <i>Let's try it.</i>
4170960 4174254 I mean, most animals<br />retreat from fire. Yes?
4174339 4176799 Fire, yeah.<br />Parker, can you rig,
4176883 4179385 <i>uh, three or four incinerator units?</i>
4179469 4182054 Give me about 20 minutes.<br />I'll do it.
4182538 4183806 Who gets to go into the vent?
4184406 4185606 I do.
4186218 4190270 No. You and Ash...
4190355 4192523 take the main air lock.
4192607 4196402 Parker, Lambert, you cover up that<br />maintenance opening, please.
4196486 4198904 <i>Right.</i>
4228143 4229987 <i>I'm at the first junction.</i>
4230687 4231987 Dallas, I'm right here.
4231991 4233766 - <i>Parker?</i><br />- Yeah.
4234166 4235346 <i>Lambert?</i>
4235350 4237943 <i>We're in position. I'm just<br />trying to get a reading here.</i>
4238127 4239579 The air lock is open.
4239779 4241179 <i>Okay, Ripley.</i>
4241264 4243532 Ready.
4253676 4255627 <i>All right. I've got<br />a reading on you now.</i>
4271128 4274122 Uh, open the hatch<br />to the third junction.
4291297 4293073 <i>Okay, I'm through.</i>
4293500 4294917 - <i>Ripley?</i><br />- Yes.
4295002 4297595 <i>Close all the hatches behind me.</i>
4298379 4299847 <i>I'm moving on.</i>
4315271 4317481 <i>Dallas, hold it a minute.<br />I think I got it.</i>
4318907 4320236 <i>Yes, I've got it.</i>
4320243 4321736 <i>Where?</i>
4322320 4324673 <i>It's somewhere around<br />the third junction.</i>
4326157 4328158 Okay, moving on.
4347512 4350556 <i>It is right around there. Now, Dallas,<br />you're gonna have to be careful.</i>
4361276 4366405 All right.<br />I've reached...
4366489 4369925 the third junction,<br />and I'm going down.
4387427 4389262 The hell's the matter with that box?
4391147 4394641 Dallas, you're gonna have to hold<br />your position for a minute. I...
4395526 4396768 <i>I've lost the signal.</i>
4397253 4399771 What?<br />You sure?
4399856 4403542 <i>Look around. Are you sure that it's not there?<br />I mean, it's got to be around there somewhere.</i>
4408114 4411992 <i>Check that out, Lambert.<br />You may be getting interference.</i>
4412076 4413910 <i>Dallas, are you sure<br />there's no sign of it?</i>
4413995 4415507 <i>I mean, it</i> is <i>there.</i>
4417207 4418707 <i>It's gotta be around there.</i>
4420618 4421805 Dallas?
4423305 4425505 God, what is happening?
4425590 4427583 <i>All right.</i>
4432388 4436850 Uh, am I... am I clear, Lambert?<br />I want to get the hell out of here.
4439062 4441646 <i>Oh, God. It's moving<br />right towards you.</i>
4443733 4445567 Uh...
4449822 4454159 Move! Get out of there!<br />Behind you! Move!
4454243 4457329 Dallas! Move, Dallas!<br />Move, Dallas!</i>
4457413 4461083 <i>Get out!<br />Move!</i>
4461167 4462834 The other way, God!
4464754 4466505 Dallas?
4466631 4468382 - No...<br />- Take it easy.
4468466 4470792 <i>Dallas?</i>
4476099 4478066 We found this laying there.
4479936 4482187 No blood...
4482271 4483890 no Dallas...
4485290 4486590 nothing.
4491948 4494408 - <i>How come I don't hear nobody saying nothing?</i><br />- I'm thinking.
4497895 4502040 Unless somebody has<br />got a better idea...
4502925 4504676 we'll proceed with Dallas' plan.
4504860 4508213 What? And end up like the others?
4508297 4510715 Ohh. No, you're<br />out of your mind.
4510800 4515053 - Got a better idea?<br />- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
4515138 4517389 We get the shuttle and just<br />get the hell out of here.
4517473 4520514 We take our chances and just hope<br />that somebody picks us up.
4520518 4522394 Lambert...
4522520 4526231 - The shuttle won't take four.<br />- <i>Then why don't we draw straws and--</i>
4526315 4529401 I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for<br />killing that goddamn thing right now.
4529485 4531528 <i>Okay.</i>
4531654 4533655 Well, let's talk about killing it.
4533739 4536867 We know it's using the air shafts--<br />Will you listen to me, Parker?!
4536993 4539786 - Shut up!<br />- Let's hear it.
4540471 4541788 Let's hear it.
4541873 4545083 It's using the air shafts.
4545209 4547961 - We don't know that.<br />- That's the only way!
4548045 4551131 We'll move in pairs.<br />We'll go step by step...
4551215 4554134 and cut off every bulkhead<br />and every vent
4554218 4557471 until we have it cornered, and then<br />we'll blow it the fuck out into space.
4557555 4559723 Is that acceptable to you?
4559849 4564936 - If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.<br />- Obviously, it means killing it.
4565021 4566813 But we have to stick together.
4568191 4571610 - <i>How are our weapons?</i><br />- The weapons are fine.
4571736 4575614 - This one needs refueling.<br />- <i>Will you get it, please?
4575740 4579543 - Ash, go with him.<br />- No, no. I can manage, Ash.
4579827 4581828 Don't follow me.
4585374 4586875 Ash?
4588669 4591171 Any suggestions from you or Mother?
4593090 4595468 <i>No, we're still collating.</i>
4597053 4599304 You're what?
4599388 4601598 You're "still collating"?
4601982 4604726 I find that hard to believe.
4606771 4609940 - What would you like me to do?<br />- <i>Just what you've been doing, Ash...</i>
4610024 4611184 <i>Nothing.</i>
4611484 4612984 <i>I've got access to Mother now,</i>
4613069 4615829 <i>and I'll get my own answers,<br />thank you.</i>
4618658 4620201 All right.
4719091 4722385 There is an explanation<br />for this, you know.
4722470 4726473 Is there really? I don't wanna<br />hear your goddamn explanation!
4728601 4731770 I want-- I want--
4733189 4737400 I want-- I w--
4743824 4746951 Parker? Lambert?
4755169 4758588 Ash, open the door.
4768224 4770225 Ash?
4774046 4775347 <i>Will you open the door?</i>
4780085 4781485 Let me by, Ash.
4817148 4819149 Yaah!
4863127 4865528 The hell are you doing?
4872828 4874829 Aahhh!
4882880 4887133 <i>Get her up. Get her up! Get her up!<br />Get her up! Get her up! Get her up!</i>
4898521 4900855 Android!<br />He's an android!
4915763 4917664 Jesus!
4920876 4924128 <i>It's a robot!<br />Ash is a goddamn robot!</i>
4926090 4927299 God!
4930761 4934430 <i>Oh! Get off me--<br />Oh!</i>
4934515 4936474 <i>Holy shit!</i>
4936559 4941020 Help! Help me get<br />this fucking thing off!
4944900 4947235 Aah!
4947996 4951947 - Oh, God!<br />- Jesus! Oh, God!
4955661 4958621 <i>How come the company<br />sent us a goddamn robot?</i>
4958706 4962458 <i>All I can think of is they must've wanted<br />the alien for their Weapons Division.</i>
4962543 4965336 <i>He's been protecting it right along.</i>
4965421 4967672 <i>Parker, will you plug it in?</i>
4967798 4972677 - <i>Uh... I don't know why--<br />- Because he may know how to kill it.</i>
4997911 5000113 <i>Ash, can you hear me?</i>
5003584 5004809 <i>Ash!</i>
5012635 5014986 Yes, I can hear you.
5019850 5021696 What was your Special Order?
5022196 5024996 You read it. I thought it was clear.
5025481 5026484 What was it?
5027084 5029484 Bring back life-form.
5029568 5034238 Priority one.<br />All other priorities rescinded.
5037242 5041954 The damn company! What about our lives,<br />you son of a bitch?
5042039 5046000 I repeat... All other priorities<br />are rescinded.
5046085 5048461 <i>How do we kill it, Ash?</i>
5048545 5051964 <i>There's got to be a way of killing it.<br />How-How do we do it?</i>
5052649 5054142 You can't.
5054927 5056031 That's bullshit!
5056331 5059331 You still don't understand what<br />you're dealing with, do you?
5061892 5064394 A perfect organism.
5067189 5070817 Its structural perfection is<br />matched only by its hostility.
5071801 5073111 You admire it.
5077199 5079283 I admire its purity.
5083622 5085540 A survivor...
5087626 5091879 unclouded... by conscience,
5091964 5095633 remorse or delusions of morality.
5097594 5100263 <i>Look, I-I've heard<br />enough of this...</i>
5100347 5102765 and I'm asking you<br />to pull the plug.
5102850 5103985 <i>Last word.</i>
5105785 5106585 What?
5108021 5112066 I can't lie to you<br />about your chances, but...
5115237 5117739 you have my sympathies.
5119859 5123202 We're gonna blow up the ship.
5123287 5126038 We'll take our chances in the shuttle.
