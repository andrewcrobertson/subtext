103786 105078 Riggs, Homicide.
105246 106830 - Nobody's dead.<br />- Night's young.
106597 108098 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
108266 109808 - Threat or scare?<br />- The real thing.
109976 111393 This gentleman saw the device.
111560 114688 On Level 1, near the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate down.
114856 116523 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
116690 118817 - Have you evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
118985 120402 - Bomb squad?<br />- On their way.
120570 122738 - It's under control. Let's go.<br />- Bomb squad?
122905 124781 Rog, I think we ought to check this out.
124949 127409 - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What?
127785 129911 - Bomb squad's on their way.<br />- There's no bomb.
130079 132539 - How can you be sure?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
132707 134916 Moon, lunar, lunatics.<br />They're everywhere.
135084 136752 - Hey, is that Greek?<br />- No, no. Latin.
136919 139087 Latin. Man, you surprise<br />the shit out of me.
139255 141465 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
141632 143925 It happens. Probably saw<br />a radio on the back seat.
144093 146845 Hey, hey. Let's not mess with this.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
147013 149222 You're right.<br />You sit tight, I'll be right back.
149390 151975 - Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What's the matter with you?
152143 154394 - There's a bomb in that building.<br />- There's not.
154562 156188 - There's a bomb!<br />- There is not.
156356 158857 There's a bomb in that building!<br />Know how come I know?
159025 160901 - How?<br />- I got eight days to retirement.
161069 162903 And I will not make a stupid mistake.
163070 164154 There is no bomb.
164322 168116 I will bet vital parts of my anatomy<br />to the fact. Now, look. Look.
168284 170660 Trust me. Okay? Trust me.
174165 176458 That's usually my first mistake.
177126 178585 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yo.
178753 180295 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
180463 181797 - Hey, Rog?<br />- Yeah?
181964 184508 - Your insurance paid up?<br />- Yeah, of course. Why?
184967 188595 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God.
190473 191515 I hate it when I'm right.
192892 196144 - You ought to learn to trust your instincts.<br />- Oh, God.
196312 198939 First impression<br />can often be the right one.
200274 203735 Leak in his diff. About to drop his<br />drive shaft. No wonder there's a bomb.
203903 205695 Just don't touch it.
207030 208490 Just looking.
209700 211284 Right.
213830 217499 What are you gonna do?<br />Don't open the door. Don't open the door!
221670 223171 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
223339 226174 - Just look at it.<br />- That's all I'm gonna do, is look.
228928 231263 Oh, my. There's more plastic than Cher.
231556 235016 I love this job. This is amateur night.<br />Open the door. I can't hear you.
235435 237018 Open the door.
237395 238728 Don't do nothing.
240022 241648 Not that one! Mm-mm!
241816 243108 You son of a bitch.
243276 246445 Well, this is a pretty shonky job.<br />I can dismantle it.
246612 249281 It looks like Beirut to me.<br />Let's get the hell out of here.
253035 256204 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and this cat are dumb enough to be here.
256372 258623 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh? Heh.
259584 262586 - Relax, Rog. Relax. Right.<br />- Don't do nothing.
262753 264713 We got nine minutes<br />and seven seconds left.
264880 266381 - Know what we could do?<br />- What?
266549 269426 - We could drive this out.<br />- Fine, it's your turn to drive.
269594 271470 No keys. Tsk, tsk. I could hot-wire it.
271637 274890 Aah! Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff, man.
275057 278143 - You're right, you're right.<br />- Why am I doing this? Why am I...?
278310 281313 Looks like we're gonna have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
281480 285901 Riggs, what are you thinking?<br />What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.
286068 288320 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
288488 290405 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think red?
290573 291823 No. No.
291990 294451 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
294619 298205 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
298372 302000 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
302168 304503 - Rog, please.<br />- Forget the cappuccino.
304670 308006 - You know what they're gonna say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here. "
308174 311968 After that, they're gonna say, "Cut the<br />blue wire," which I'm gonna do right now.
312512 314721 - Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Riggs. Wait.<br />- What?
314889 317140 - How can you be so sure?<br />- Oh, it's just a hunch.
317308 319518 - A hunch?<br />- Remember the bomb under your toilet?
319685 322771 - Oh, shit. How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
322939 326149 This is more simplified.<br />A bit more powerful, but more simplified.
326317 329694 - From where I was sitting, I couldn't see.<br />- Forget it. Come on, trust me.
329862 331112 Yeah, so I gotta trust you?
331280 334032 Guess not.<br />Well, I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
334200 336368 Oh! Oh!
336536 339955 - What? What?<br />- A minute ago you said blue.
340790 343208 - Did I say blue?<br />- Riggs, you said blue.
343709 345126 - Well, I meant red.<br />- You sure?
345460 347170 We can do it your way if you'd like.
347338 349464 - My way? I don't have...!<br />- Quiet!
349632 352968 - I'm sure, okay?<br />- Shit.
354929 356763 You ready?
356930 358640 - Rog?<br />- What?
359140 362352 Won't you kind of miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
362520 365313 Aren't you gonna miss it a little bit? Huh?
367358 368775 I'm cutting the wire.
369569 370610 Snip. See? All done.
373239 375115 - Rog.<br />- Yeah?
376325 378910 - Grab the cat.<br />- Grab the cat?
379078 381997 Get back! Take cover!
441932 443391 Where are they?
448856 450273 Bravo.
455237 456571 Oops.
458115 459783 Right. Oops.
462244 464120 Right.
469126 472128 Seven days to retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
472296 474756 I should've cut the red wire.
474924 477008 - You did.<br />- No, I didn't. I cut the blue wire.
477176 480261 That's what I meant.<br />We should've waited for the bomb squad.
480429 482097 Am I gonna have to listen to this?
482264 484808 - Every day until I retire.<br />- That'll be a week too long.
484975 486267 Ah, shit.
486435 488687 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me too.
488854 491272 - How?<br />- I gotta listen to you bitch about them!
491440 495819 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did cut the red wire!
496362 499572 What's this? It's kind of soft.<br />It's not a bulletproof vest.
499740 502617 - It's not gonna keep anything out.<br />- Gonna keep my stomach in.
502993 504953 What do you got under there?
505454 507872 - It's a girdle.<br />- What?
508374 510333 Oh, God. It's a girdle.
511293 512419 Trish know about this?
512586 514379 Not a woman's girdle, a man's girdle.
514547 517090 - They make girdles for men?<br />- They make girdles for men.
517258 518591 - They do, huh?<br />- Yeah, they do.
518759 521970 I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.<br />Cleaners must have shrunk it.
522138 523680 Well, you should take it to Chin.
523848 526891 I did take it to Chin over in Alpine.<br />Look at it. It's shrunk all up in here.
528686 530645 - Have to hold my breath.<br />- Did you see that?
530813 533148 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
533899 535024 Jaywalking?
535526 537652 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
537820 539154 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
539320 540905 - What did I do?<br />- Stand there.
541073 544033 What'd you do? Jaywalking.<br />I saw you. I have to cite you.
544200 546244 Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on.
546412 548663 Can you handle this<br />or should I radio for backup?
548830 551332 - Got the ticket book?<br />- People are committing crimes...
551500 553835 - ... and you're hassling me?<br />- Shut up!
554003 555044 Yeah.
556922 557964 Oh!
558132 561718 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago. Let me see.
561886 563678 Can't read it. The print is little.
563846 565597 - Without my glasses.<br />- You're no help.
565765 569017 Can we speed this up? You may<br />have nothing to do. I have things to do.
569185 572061 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
572229 574355 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
574523 576399 - License for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah, jaywalking.
576567 579360 I don't have it on me, okay?<br />I wasn't driving, okay?
579528 581654 I was walking.<br />What, do I need a walking license now?
581822 584282 - Oh, let's just shoot him.<br />- Oh, oh, oh, what is he crazy?
584450 587452 I'm gonna drill him.<br />We can make it look like suicide.
587620 590497 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, no, no. The video cameras.
590664 592123 I don't care! I'm gonna drill him!
592290 595627 Get out of here, before my partner kills you!<br />Go that way, not that way!
595795 596836 This way! Over there!
597004 599798 - Go, run! Now! Run!<br />- Right there, yeah.
607640 609766 Hey. Hey!
610226 613895 Hey, wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign.
614480 617816 - Hey.<br />- What's that?
618400 620902 - Wait a minute.<br />- You forgot to sign the form.
621070 623822 Hey, who are you?<br />You're not the regular guy.
623989 626157 - He's on vacation.<br />- On vacation?
626325 628201 Well, who the hell is that?
629160 630411 Get in the truck! Get!
637962 639587 You fucking prick!
643843 645426 - Riggs! Riggs!<br />- Are you all right?
647346 648721 - Hey, are you a cop?<br />- Yeah.
648930 652058 Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.<br />Will continue transmission.
652226 653393 Call 911.
653560 656646 All right, honey.<br />Let me drive. We're in pursuit.
656814 659065 I'm driving, baby! Don't worry.
665656 668700 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
668868 670159 All right. Just stay close.
676834 680253 Hey, hey, hey. Right behind you, baby.<br />That's right. Take a good look.
680420 683256 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass.
692349 693474 Ram him! Ram him!
700149 701608 - Watch out, Riggs.<br />- Come on!
710784 713494 - Are you married, sugar?<br />- What? Yeah, 24 years.
713662 716122 - Yeah, 24 years.<br />- Yeah, but is it working?
721837 724339 - Hey, you can't get closer?<br />- I am. I'm getting closer.
727009 729177 Hold on, Riggs! Hold on!
738145 740730 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hold on! Hold on! We got you.
740898 742315 Hold on!
743192 745068 - I told you I could do it.<br />- Closer!
745235 747028 - Get me up there.<br />- Yeah, get up close.
747196 748655 I am. I am, all right?
753994 755203 - Back off, back off!<br />- Aah!
767633 771219 - If he falls, don't hit him.<br />- Don't worry. I got something for you.
808257 809257 Whoa!
809425 812760 Ooh, hoo-hoo! Thanks for the interest,<br />sugar, but one thing at a time.
827484 829318 - Catch him, catch him.<br />- All right.
831947 833781 Keep singing, baby. Just stay close.
841123 842123 Relax, baby. Relax, baby.
842290 845043 Ho! Ho! Ho!<br />Hey, keep your hands off my thigh.
845210 847795 - My partner's in trouble. Watch out for him.<br />- I got him!
860976 864979 - Boy, I'm getting too old for this shit.<br />- Not for me, you're not, sugar.
868067 870651 You have the right<br />to remain unconscious.
871028 872487 Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
877826 879410 - Hey, Riggs. You all right?<br />- Ha!
879578 883498 I'm okay. I think we gotta book this guy<br />for not wearing his seat belt though.
883665 885666 Hey, that was dynamite driving.
885834 889378 - No, she's the dynamite driver.<br />- I'll show you dynamite.
889546 892673 - Whoo!<br />- Sure enough. Whoo!
893092 896594 - What have you two been up to?<br />- What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
896762 899055 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- No, I didn't. She kissed me.
899223 903226 It looked mutual. Wipe that lipstick off<br />before the guys at the station start talking.
903393 904894 Hey, go spit, Riggs.
906355 908689 You okay? You all right?
910025 911651 Back to bed. Back to bed.
911985 914362 - Morning, guys. Daddy.<br />- Hey.
914530 917573 Hey, how about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today, okay?
918534 921828 - You got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
923038 924580 Hold this. Hangers?
924748 928251 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. That's a cute dog.
928418 930169 - It's a Westie.<br />- Morning. Westie?
930337 931963 - Morning, Trish.<br />- Hey.
932130 933756 Morning, Rog.
934550 935716 - Hey, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
935884 938553 - What? Didn't you brush your teeth?<br />- Hold it, mister.
938720 940721 I'm just looking for some orange juice.
940889 944267 Don't get fingerprints on the door,<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
944434 947895 - Did somebody commit a murder?<br />- Somebody's coming to see the house.
948063 950273 Oh. Hey, I think a little mess<br />adds to the charm.
961034 962743 How's this, huh?
962953 964912 This great? Okay? Okay?
966248 967540 Kelly's Pool Hall. Kelly speaking.
967708 970626 Yeah, right, Kelly.<br />Hi, let me speak to Dad.
970794 974046 Oh, hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
974630 977300 - It's for you, Rog.<br />- Me?
977634 978926 Hmm?
979260 980928 Uh, who are...? Who is it? Hello?
981096 983097 Hi. It's my first day at work.

984933 985933 Beautiful, huh?
986100 988394 - Come on, come on, check it out.<br />- Beautiful lawn.
988562 989854 It's great.
990022 992190 See how quiet it is here? Listen, listen.
992357 993524 That great? Come on.
993692 996027 - Very quiet.<br />- The inside's better than the outside.
996195 998946 - It's the people to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
1001867 1004076 Okay, okay. Just wanna make sure.
1004244 1007538 I gotta show you this room first.<br />This is my favorite. This is great.
1007706 1010291 - Okay? I love it. That it? That say it all?<br />- Oh, yeah.
1010459 1011626 - Beautiful.<br />- Very nice.

1014004 1015046 Shh. Shh. Shh.
1015214 1017924 - You do? It's been completely replaced.<br />- Oh, why was that?
1018090 1021052 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
1021220 1022929 Shot up the whole place. Shh.
1023096 1025306 Son of a bitch.<br />I'm gonna cut him off at the...
1025474 1027266 - Ha, ha! Leo.<br />- Oh, ha. Drug dealer.
1027434 1029727 It's true. Hey, it's true. True.
1029895 1033064 Okay, anyway, look. Like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave the drapes.
1033232 1035107 - Hey, I thought you quit, huh?<br />- I did.
1035275 1037902 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm edgy.
1038070 1041447 - You're edgy? Here.<br />- That stuff about the drug dealer...
1041615 1042823 Chew on these.
1042990 1045076 Listen, I have to tell you<br />these things, okay?
1045244 1047328 It's the law. It's called full disclosure.
1047496 1049789 Anything else you wanna disclose<br />before we go on?
1051290 1054418 Okay, now that you mention it, the<br />bathroom has been completely remodeled...
1054586 1056128 ...due to unexpected bomb damage.
1056296 1058172 Hey, hey, hey, come on. It's okay.
1058340 1060216 - Son of a bitch. I'm gonna...<br />Shh. Shh.
1060384 1062426 - Don't. You'll never sell...<br />Shh.
1067474 1069684 Okay, okay.<br />So, uh, we saw enough of the kitchen.
1069850 1072853 Let me show you upstairs.<br />Wait till you see this. It's beautiful.
1073020 1074522 You're really gonna love this.
1079027 1081696 - They're gone.<br />- Leo Getz, I guess I'm gonna kill him.
1081863 1084282 Son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill him!<br />I'm gonna kill him!
1084449 1086951 Don't...<br />He's trying to ruin me, Riggs.
1087494 1090329 - Hey, Leo, you got...<br />- They weren't gonna buy the house!
1090497 1093958 - Yeah, you scared them away.<br />- No, they couldn't afford the financing.
1094126 1096294 - Oh, Jesus.<br />- Okay, relax.
1096460 1099797 I had to tell them everything.<br />It's the law, okay? I mean, full disclosure.
1099965 1102008 - You must have heard of it.<br />- I'm a cop. I'm the law.
1102175 1103217 - Ah!<br />- Ow!
1103385 1106262 - Get off me! What is it with you?<br />- Hold it.
1107556 1108597 Okay, okay.
1108765 1111434 At least he didn't tell them<br />about that nail-gun incident.
1111600 1113728 - Oh...<br />- I forgot.
1113895 1116314 Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1116480 1118441 - Permit?<br />- You know what I'll do? Hold it.
1118608 1121319 Leo's here. I'll take care of it.<br />I'll make a couple calls.
1121486 1123154 We'll get some back-dated permits.
1123322 1125489 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Uh, sunroom. Sunroom.
1125657 1128242 - Okay, okay, okay. I got you.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1128410 1131078 - It's gotta be easier than this.<br />- They don't know Leo Getz.
1131246 1134123 You could do with less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1134290 1137460 Yeah. Thank you, Leo. Son of a bitch.
1137627 1139920 Stop fronting yourself.<br />You know what I'm saying?
1140088 1142048 Swing with me and my crew.<br />That's the move.
1147179 1149096 Forget school.
1151183 1153642 Oh, man. Here comes your pops, man.
1153935 1155811 - Later, man.<br />- All right, I gotcha.
1155979 1158773 - All right, bro. I'm out, man.<br />- Next time, G. Peace, bro.
1161693 1163569 - Morning, Rog.<br />- How you doing?
1163737 1165863 - How you doing, Mr. Fisher?<br />- Hey, Nick.
1166030 1167782 Hey, Nick.
1167949 1170576 - Uh, wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1170744 1172620 Haven't seen him around in a while.
1173705 1177124 - He dropped out of school.<br />- Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
1177292 1178793 Yeah, I know.
1180128 1181253 Hey, Nick.
1182297 1184632 - Yeah, Dad.<br />- Be good.
1185509 1187009 Word.
1188845 1190471 Hey, word, Nick.
1190847 1192306 Word.
1195268 1197978 - Word, Riggs.<br />- Word, Rog.
1198647 1200189 - What are we talking about?<br />- Word.
1200357 1202650 Starts with a W,<br />"or" in the middle, D on the end.
1202818 1204902 - Word. Oh, yeah, that word.<br />- Where you been?
1205070 1207488 - Word.<br />- Word.
1220794 1223838 - Hey, Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1224005 1226090 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Hey, wait here for me.
1226258 1229009 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1229177 1232930 You sank your money into this, out here<br />in the middle of the fucking desert?
1233098 1235349 That's right.<br />Know why it's gonna be a gold mine?
1235517 1236559 Do tell me.
1236726 1240229 Because nobody wants to live next door<br />to people like you. You're a menace.
1240397 1243649 Jack, I came out here to do business,<br />not be insulted by you.
1243817 1245151 Relax, Tyrone.
1245318 1247820 Just like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1247988 1251365 Hey, Smitty, come here. Come here.
1253285 1256537 What's wrong with you? Don't I<br />pay you good? Don't I take care of you?
1256705 1257705 Sure you do, Jack.
1257873 1260458 What's this stupid business<br />you and Billy tried to pull?
1260625 1264003 - It was a good plan. It worked.<br />- It worked? It didn't work.
1264170 1265546 You got nailed first time out.
1265714 1268382 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1268550 1269842 Understand what I'm saying?
1270010 1272219 See how that can jeopardize everything?<br />Right, Tyrone?
1272387 1273804 Heh, heh, whatever.
1273972 1276390 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1276975 1280478 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1280645 1283272 He's gonna have to face the music<br />on his own.
1283565 1286692 But you and me, Smitty,<br />we're gonna start over.
1286860 1288611 You know what I mean?
1289570 1291405 - Whatever you say, Jack.<br />- Good.
1291573 1293574 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1300373 1302583 Now we got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1304920 1308088 - Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />- Yeah, right.
1308256 1311175 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1311343 1314553 They get greedy and do something stupid<br />that jeopardizes everything.
1314804 1316013 It's a bitch.
1316430 1318349 Stick around. This is the good part.
1318767 1322061 We can put our initials in there. Yeah?
1322229 1323938 Jesus Christ.
1327317 1329527 - Lankershim and Vineland.<br />- Where are we going, Rog?
1329694 1333948 Uh, right here. Rianne's got<br />a new job. I promised her I'd stop by.
1334115 1335658 That's a good reason.
1336493 1339328 All right. Here we are.
1345210 1348504 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1348672 1351549 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1361393 1364478 - Where are you going? Get down!<br />- Get down! All of you, get down!
1378326 1380536 Riggs! Riggs!
1385709 1388669 How do you like that, huh?<br />What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1388837 1391213 - No! This is a film. There are not...<br />- What?
1391380 1394425 Cut, cut, cut!<br />Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1394593 1396885 - Get him off my set.<br />- This isn't part of the story.
1397053 1399346 - Can we get a cop?<br />- Where did you come from?
1399514 1400848 Jesus. Who are you?
1401016 1404143 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1404310 1406604 - You really thought I was in trouble?<br />- Oh, I did.
1406770 1409607 - You did?<br />- A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1409774 1411650 What is wrong with you?<br />Are you an idiot?
1411818 1412860 I apologize.
1413028 1416822 - He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />- Yeah, we're both here to visit...
1416990 1418240 Oh, he's a friend of yours?
1418408 1422202 Let me tell you something, okay?<br />You're fired. All right. Have a nice day.
1422370 1424204 Fired? Riggs, what did you do?
1425040 1428834 - You're not fired. Don't worry.<br />- No, you're not. Take it easy, Riggs.
1429002 1430836 You can't fire her for something I did.
1431004 1433172 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1433340 1436050 - I apologize to everybody.<br />- Don't push him.
1436217 1437551 - Don't push.<br />- All of you, go!
1437719 1439845 Just take it easy.<br />Don't push him. Don't push.
1440013 1442890 - Get off my set, all right?<br />- What are you, deaf? Go.
1443058 1444266 Move. Get off my set.
1444434 1446560 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1446728 1448646 - Is that so?<br />- Don't hit him.
1448813 1450105 It's a normal day.
1451358 1453609 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?<br />I'm sorry.
1453777 1456987 God, I'm all thumbs. Look, he fell down.<br />Let me help you up.
1457155 1458697 I said don't hit him, Riggs.
1458865 1460741 - Is she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired.
1460909 1461992 - Is she fired?<br />- No.
1462160 1463994 - She got a raise?<br />- It's all right.
1464162 1466080 - Yes. I said yes. Thank you.<br />- Good.
1466247 1470250 - Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.<br />- Yeah.
1470585 1472169 We'd like you to come back.
1473880 1475255 All right.
1477217 1479343 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1479510 1482304 - I couldn't use my gun. There was a crowd.<br />- Okay, six more days.
1482472 1484264 Look, I don't wanna hear that anymore.
1484432 1487601 Hey, did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise? Did she?
1487769 1489561 I don't hear a "thank you. "
1489729 1493190 Maybe I should, uh, become one of those<br />Hollywood agents. What do you think?
1493358 1495818 - Hmm. Won't work.<br />- Why?
1495985 1500239 - You gotta have killer instinct.<br />- Heh. Son of a bitch.
1500448 1504326 - We should've put the bag on the meter.<br />- Put it in the glove compartment.
1504494 1507454 - No, no. I don't do that anymore.<br />- Oh, yeah? Good man.
1507622 1509957 No, it's full up already.<br />Put it in the back seat.
1514045 1517172 - You really like those things, huh?<br />- What, these? Yeah, it's good.
1519968 1523262 Hey, you know, you can eat a box of them.<br />I'm still dying for a cigarette.
1526640 1529768 - What, you cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1529936 1533605 - Old razor?<br />- Old face.
1535190 1538944 I think you're really letting this<br />retirement thing get you down, Rog.
1539112 1542281 Why don't you spend a couple<br />more years, think it over. Why quit?
1542449 1544658 - I got plans for my retirement.<br />- Yeah, plans.
1544826 1546618 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Sure. Big plans?
1546786 1548746 - I had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1548913 1550330 Like, uh...
1551207 1554960 - Uh, hey, things, man. Okay, yeah, huh?<br />- Things. Things.
1555128 1557171 Yeah, yeah. Things I've put off too long.
1557338 1560257 - Those things. I got those things too.<br />- Yeah, Riggs. Right.
1560425 1563552 I can see you've given this<br />a lot of thought, Rog, actually.
1565513 1567014 Yeah.
1568016 1570225 I've given it a lot of thought, Riggs.
1589204 1590913 Goddamn it!
1591080 1592247 What the hell's going on?
1592415 1594041 I'm pissed off! You need a reason?
1594209 1595459 I thought I heard gunfire.
1595627 1597711 Get your hearing checked. Put that away.
1598338 1601882 - What are you looking at?<br />- Hey, man. Peace.
1623196 1627866 - Riggs, why'd you call us down here?<br />- Everybody, it's all right.
1628034 1630911 - Hey, how you doing, son?<br />- Your mother know you're here?
1634415 1635999 Hey, did you do this?
1636167 1638710 - Nice shooting, phew.<br />- Regular Billy the Kid, huh?
1640088 1641880 Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
1642048 1644925 Give that to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1645093 1647678 - Hey, can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1647846 1650722 Okay, who's wearing?<br />Roger, you're wearing. I need you.
1650890 1654935 - Why me? You guys should be wearing.<br />- Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1655103 1657271 I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1657438 1659731 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Just get back.
1659899 1662442 - All you perverts, turn your heads.<br />- Take it off.
1662610 1664194 Hold this shirt.
1664362 1665445 Woo-hoo.
1665613 1667489 Wearing a girdle, man.
1667657 1669908 - He's got a girdle!<br />- This is not a girdle.
1670076 1672953 This is not a girdle. It's my back.<br />My back went out on me.
1673120 1676164 - He hurt his back.<br />- Hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
1676332 1678876 What you talking about?<br />I hurt my back lifting weights.
1679043 1681628 Yeah, I saw him do it.<br />Okay, everybody, listen up.
1681796 1684673 I want you all to have a look<br />at these lovely bullets.
1684840 1686800 - These are cute.<br />- Notice the smooth jacket.
1686968 1690554 Pay particular attention to the tip.<br />Good close look at it.
1694142 1697603 Now, you've all seen these vests<br />stop a. 357 magnum bullet, haven't you?
1697770 1699396 - Yeah.<br />- So what?
1699564 1700856 Okay.
1702150 1703317 Observe.
1718333 1720208 Son of a bitch.
1721920 1724379 - Armor-piercing bullets? Jesus.<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1724547 1726048 - Shit.<br />- Serious shit.
1726215 1729301 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1729469 1732012 - Armored-car guy?<br />- Yeah. They're out on the streets.
1732180 1735140 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1735308 1737351 - Holy fuck.<br />- See you, Riggs.
1737518 1739311 Well, let's just keep our eyes open.
1739479 1741188 Cop killers.
1743190 1745067 Son of a bitch.
1747487 1749363 I, uh, think we should<br />talk to Billy Phelps.
1749530 1751865 I'll have him brought down<br />for interrogation, okay?
1752950 1754284 Yeah.
1760166 1762709 I'm here to talk to a prisoner, sergeant,<br />Billy Phelps.
1762877 1766004 - Can I see all your ID there?<br />- Sure.
1766172 1769383 William Phelps, armored-car suspect.<br />He's been moved to interrogation.
1769550 1772052 - Know where that is?<br />- Sure. Been there a lot.
1772303 1773345 Okay.
1782313 1783563 Same floor.
1783940 1785399 - Hey, Rog.<br />- Hm?
1785566 1786858 I guess now you're retiring...
1787026 1789444 ...that, uh, Swiss bank account<br />is gonna come in pretty handy.
1790822 1793240 How much you got in there, a million?<br />Million and a half?
1793574 1795909 - Five.<br />- Five.
1796077 1797577 Well, you deserve it, man.
1797745 1801081 It's better than those miserable<br />drug dealers getting it.
1805086 1806712 What are you talking about?
1806879 1810173 Hey, don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1811050 1812884 - They can't trace it.<br />- Well, now, heh...
1813052 1816263 Look, so long as I get an invite<br />to the Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1816430 1817806 Casa what?
1817974 1820183 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1820350 1822102 - She's a cop, man.<br />- I know she's a cop.
1822270 1824771 She's probably on the take too.<br />What do you take me for?
1824939 1827357 Come on. The whole force is bent.
1827525 1830402 Look, she may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1830570 1831820 I don't have nothing there.
1831988 1833822 - I ain't been to Portugal.<br />- Beautiful.
1833990 1836783 This Murtaugh... This...
1839370 1841538 Son of a bitch.
1841706 1842748 Hey, how you doing?
1842915 1844374 - Fine.<br />- Who is it today?
1844542 1845834 - Billy...<br />- Billy Phelps.
1846419 1847461 Huh.
1847628 1849254 - Who are you?<br />- Fly me.
1849422 1851465 I'm your friendly Portuguese airline.
1852008 1854760 - She's Infernal Affairs, Rog.<br />- How'd you know?
1854927 1858638 Well, I took the liberty of looking<br />at your file folder. It was showing.
1858806 1860557 Lorna Cole.
1860850 1863560 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1863728 1866646 Yeah, what's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1866814 1870525 - We're taking over, thanks.<br />- Nobody told us they were taking over.
1870693 1873904 - Nobody has to tell you anything.<br />- I wanna go and see the captain.
1874072 1875405 You wanna go see the captain?
1875573 1877324 - Let's go see the captain.<br />- All right.
1877492 1879659 - And, uh, put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1879827 1883497 - Hey, hey, hey. Just take it easy, man.<br />- Okay.
1894800 1897469 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1897637 1899346 - Phelps? You too?<br />- Hi.
1899514 1901848 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1902016 1905018 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1905186 1907771 - Wanna sign in here, sarge?<br />- Sure.
1907939 1909564 - Miss.<br />- Thank you.
1909732 1913193 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1913360 1915612 This is Herman Walters,<br />chief of intelligence.
1915780 1917697 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Doone.
1917865 1919449 - Cole.<br />- Pleased to meet you.
1919617 1922494 The Phelps case has been<br />transferred to Internal Affairs.
1922662 1924538 - Why? Tell me why.<br />- I can't tell you.
1924705 1926039 - That's classified.<br />- Classi...?
1926207 1928959 - We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />- Busted is right.
1929127 1930627 He spent the night in hospital.
1930795 1932754 - He forgot to buckle.<br />- We cited him for it.
1932922 1935215 - I know. I read your report.<br />- Yeah.
1935383 1938051 You know, our cases have unfortunately<br />crossed paths here.
1938219 1940554 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
1940720 1942430 Captain, what's she talking about?
1942598 1945433 - That's classified.<br />- I said, "Captain. " I'm talking to him.
1946102 1947227 I'm telling you...
1947395 1949563 I said, "Captain. "<br />I'm talking to the captain.
1949730 1951565 - That's classified.<br />- I'm talking to him.
1951732 1954359 - Bullshit!<br />- Murtaugh. Hey, hey. Riggs!
1956154 1959322 Look, maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case.
1959490 1962951 From their records, the only thing<br />they contribute is mayhem and chaos.
1963119 1965287 I'm Chaos and he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1965454 1968832 - Are we required reading or something?<br />- As a matter of fact, you are.
1969000 1972043 It's a cross between Police Gazette<br />and Mad magazine.
1972210 1974713 - What's wrong with Mad?<br />- Nothing, I used to read it.
1974880 1978049 - Oh, yeah, you've got some good taste.<br />- When I was 12.
1978217 1980927 - When you... Yeah.<br />- Hey, hey. Riggs, let's go.
1981095 1983096 We busted him, we can talk to him.<br />Let's go.
1983264 1985432 - Captain.<br />- Riggs. Murtaugh.
1985600 1987726 Get your asses back here.
1990813 1992606 You'll be needing these.
1993440 1995275 I'm reinstating both of you.
1995943 1997777 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
1998404 2000614 - God.<br />- No. You're Murtaugh and I'm Riggs.
2001365 2002824 You really are a beautiful man.
2002992 2004951 Yeah, right. Just get rid of the blues.
2005119 2007621 - They don't go with the ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
2009707 2011958 - Yeah, right.<br />- And get a haircut.
2012126 2015503 - Of course I won't.<br />- You just exceeded your authority, captain.
2015670 2018048 - That's not the way I see it.<br />- The chief will.
2018216 2020258 - Well, take it up with him.<br />- I think I will.
2020426 2021968 We don't want this screwed up.
2022136 2025388 You're gonna have to get him<br />between lunches. Son of a bitch.
2028100 2029643 Hi, Billy.
2032063 2034814 - Jack.<br />- Bye, Billy.
2042030 2043657 See you, Billy.
2050248 2052249 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2052416 2055001 Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2056670 2058755 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2058923 2061716 - Doing what?<br />- His armored-car thing.
2061884 2065011 - I wouldn't know.<br />- I'm not interested in armored cars.
2078276 2080235 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2080403 2081736 Yeah, I think you're right.
2081904 2084698 Boy, these six days is gonna be rough.
2084865 2087409 God, be good to me, please.
2088828 2091454 Shit, son of a bitch knew<br />there was a camera in the wall.
2091622 2093456 Look how he's covering up.
2093624 2095417 - Damn it.<br />- Didn't know there was one...
2095584 2096876 ...in the interrogation room.
2097044 2098378 - There isn't.<br />- Yeah.
2099255 2100672 Installed them six months ago.
2100840 2102674 - Every station.<br />- That's great.
2102842 2104843 Six months, and we don't know about it?
2105010 2107053 This is the police police, captain.
2107220 2110682 "Police police. " Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2110850 2113059 - Am I getting to you?<br />- You trying to bait me?
2113227 2115729 - I'm a master of it.<br />- Well, that figures.
2115896 2118732 Hey, heh, baiting master. Great.<br />I'll try that on Trish.
2118899 2122110 Freeze that. Stop it. Jack Travis.
2122278 2126156 - Who?<br />- Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2126657 2128033 He was one of us.
2128200 2131036 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />Could beat a confession out of anyone.
2131203 2132412 One hell of a dirty cop.
2132580 2136291 Never seen so many suspensions and<br />reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2136459 2139085 Well, he's also as tough as they come.
2139545 2141755 - What happened to him?<br />- I don't know.
2141922 2145425 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2145593 2148261 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2148429 2149929 We better brief Walters.
2150890 2152932 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2153100 2155393 - That's harassment.<br />- "Cute stuff. " That's you.
2156354 2160023 - Captain.<br />- Boys, boys. Just the captain.
2160190 2163610 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Billy Phelps hit the floor.
2163778 2166529 Why don't you go back<br />and beat your street?
2166697 2167739 Really good work.
2167907 2169866 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Leo, Not now.
2170034 2171993 - Hey, Roger, Roger.<br />- Not now, Leo.
2172160 2174954 - No, no. Not now.<br />- We gotta talk, babe, okay?
2175122 2176998 You're in trouble. You got termites.
2177166 2178416 - Termites?<br />- Uh-huh.
2178584 2180668 - Oh, God.<br />- You're infested.
2180836 2183129 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2183297 2186466 Rog, I think we should go.<br />Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2186634 2189219 We should go to Evidence,<br />pull every file on this guy.
2189387 2191679 I know this guy.<br />What are you watching, Geraldo?
2191847 2193098 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2193265 2195475 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2195643 2197977 - Hey, where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2198145 2201106 His name's Jack Travis, Leo.<br />Does that ring a bell? Jack Travis.
2201273 2204025 Hey, hey, hey.<br />Hands off the clothes. Okay, baby?
2204193 2206903 - Okay, I'm thinking. Let me think. Okay.<br />- Think.
2207070 2208696 - A big party.<br />- Okay.
2208864 2212283 Somebody brought a monkey because<br />the monkey knocked over the salad bar.
2212450 2215495 And this guy comes in,<br />introduced me to another guy...
2215663 2217705 ...who wants a favor.
2217873 2219582 - I got it. I got it. I got it!<br />- What?
2219750 2220583 He got it.
2220876 2222877 - I remember! I remember!<br />- You remember!
2223045 2226005 Hey, don't do it.<br />Don't let the earring fool you.
2226173 2228341 - Hey, we're back. We're back.<br />- Yeah. Yeah.
2228509 2229843 - All right. Listen.<br />- Yeah.
2230010 2231636 Think I could get a gun this time?
2231804 2233263 No!
2242565 2247402 Okay, this is it. See, these guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them.
2247570 2251448 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2251615 2255910 Your guy, hockey.<br />The best seats in the house.
2257872 2260748 - Where's the seats?<br />- Yeah.
2260916 2263668 Uh, probably by the glass.<br />Around the glass.
2263836 2266087 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2266255 2267755 Why don't we spread out?
2267923 2272343 You know, if we all take a different<br />direction, it'd be like old times.
2272510 2275472 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2275639 2277599 Just take it easy, now.
2290070 2293406 Go! All right!
2305336 2308463 Los Angeles<br />penalty. Number 15, Tony Brown.
2308630 2310590 Two minutes for high-sticking.
2310758 2313051 Time, 5:15.

2338994 2342247 We know you're in here. We know<br />where you are. Just stay in your seat.
2342414 2344290 Don't be stupid.
2344583 2346918 And I'll be there to escort you out<br />in a minute.
2347086 2350213 There's policemen at every exit,<br />so it's no use trying to run.
2350380 2352340 - Stay where you are.<br />- Smart son of a bitch.
2352508 2354968 Thank you for your cooperation.<br />Play on, boys.
2369692 2370900 Come on, let's go!
2381328 2383496 Get out of my fucking way!
2386166 2390211 Ooh! Ooh! Riggs! Riggs! Roger! Roger!
2394592 2396634 Ooh! Excuse me. Excuse me.
2403850 2406561 - Hey!<br />- Riggs!
2409607 2410815 You can't be on the ice.
2415529 2417447 Ooh! Ooh!
2418198 2419949 I got him. I got him.
2422077 2425204 You have the right to remain...<br />You're under arrest.
2434548 2437050 - Fucking weasel.<br />- What the hell's going on here?
2437217 2438217 I'm L.A.P.D. L.A.P.D.
2438385 2440678 I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
2440846 2443306 What is this, a convention?
2447936 2450480 - I got him.<br />- You're all right, pal. Just stay calm.
2454400 2455610 Tell my mother, Rog.
2455778 2458446 - Where did he go?<br />- Down there. Down there.
2468874 2471417 Son of a bitch.
2473253 2475254 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2475422 2478675 - No. You'll be okay.<br />- Yeah, yeah. I'm dying, Roger.
2478842 2482095 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm choking, see?
2482262 2484222 This is what they do when they die.<br />I saw them.
2484390 2487725 - Leo, it's gonna be okay.<br />- Yeah, well, I'm... I'm numb.
2487893 2490019 My whole body's numb. I can't feel it.
2490187 2492855 - Leo, Leo.<br />- I'm gonna die, I know it. What?
2493273 2494857 You're lying on the ice.
2496777 2499696 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2499863 2502031 - That's why I'm numb, huh?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2502199 2503908 He shot me. Look at all the blood.
2504076 2506994 - It's just a flesh wound.<br />- So it's okay.
2507162 2509455 - Let's get you up. One, two, three.<br />- Yeah.
2509623 2511874 There you go. You're gonna make it.
2512042 2515002 He's okay, he's okay.<br />He's gonna make it. He's alive.
2515170 2516921 Ooh! Ow, ow!
2521385 2524971 - Bring him this way, guys.<br />- I can't believe this. I just...
2525139 2527390 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- You'll be all right.
2527558 2528850 - Riggs, you here?<br />- Calm down.
2529017 2532145 We're all the same now.<br />We all got shot.
2532312 2534272 - You'll be fine.<br />- Ouch. That's...
2534440 2537567 - Relax, Mr. Getz.<br />- I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.
2537735 2539110 I can take this. Ouch!
2539278 2542488 - We're gonna take care of it.<br />- You'll be out of here. No big deal.
2542656 2544907 I don't think that's a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this.
2545075 2546743 - Yeah.<br />- You should rest up, Leo.
2546910 2548327 A dumdum wound can be serious.
2548996 2550580 What's a dumdum wound?
2551123 2555126 You don't know? A guy got his thumb<br />shot off by a dumdum.
2555294 2557336 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2557504 2559130 Dead two days later?
2559298 2560631 He died from dumdums?
2560799 2563217 - We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Yeah, take it slow.
2563385 2565678 Two days? All right,<br />we'll keep him two days.
2565846 2568181 - You'll be here two days.<br />- That Leo's chart?
2568348 2571100 - Two days, you'll be good as new.<br />- I should be with them.
2571268 2573644 - Bye, Leo.<br />- I should be with... Hey! Ow! Ouch!
2574313 2577690 - How do you spell, "proctological"?<br />- Rectal exam?
2578066 2581027 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure we can.
2581195 2583738 - Why's she taking...?<br />- Please, Mr. Getz. You'll get...
2583906 2586949 You've been shot in the arm.<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2587117 2588868 - Okay.<br />- There's a clock in your room.
2589036 2591037 - Okay, fine. Riggs.<br />- Yeah?
2591205 2592622 This look like a dumdum wound?
2593373 2595750 - It sounded like one when it happened.<br />- Shit.
2595918 2598669 - Take it easy. Two days.<br />- Two days and you'll be out.
2598837 2599879 - All right.<br />- Okay?
2600047 2602715 - Hey, I'll see you guys.<br />- We won't make a move without you.
2602883 2604967 I thought that bullet sounded different.
2605135 2607553 - Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2607720 2610014 - You own your own house, doc?<br />- What?
2610182 2612099 - You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2612267 2613559 Watch.
2614269 2617688 About time. These doggy treats<br />are okay, but I need some human food.
2617856 2618898 Don't worry.
2619066 2622527 I'm about to make you one of the best<br />things you ever had in your life.
2622903 2627323 - Hey, you ever eat one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far. I'll take a chance.
2627490 2630368 Yeah. Hey, Fast Eddie.
2630536 2632411 - How's business?<br />- Booming. Can't you tell?
2632579 2633621 I'm looking at it.
2633789 2635164 - You meet my partner?<br />- No.
2635332 2638167 I wanna cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2638335 2639585 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2639753 2641754 - Gonna let him cook?<br />- Do I have a choice?
2641922 2645383 - No, because it's Wednesday.<br />- Too big to argue with.
2645968 2648052 In that case, give me a McRog.
2648220 2650137 - Hold the hair.<br />- Heh, heh.
2650305 2651347 You wash your hands?
2651515 2655142 Keep joking, but I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger.
2655310 2659105 And you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2659273 2662900 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, Rog. Well, except you.
2663068 2664777 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2664945 2667613 Oh, yeah?<br />When is he gonna say something funny?
2667780 2671409 Hey, uh, you gonna put that out?<br />You're finished with it, yeah?
2671577 2673286 Do you mind, huh? Thanks.
2675622 2677456 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2677875 2679542 - Chew on this onion.<br />- Yeah.
2679710 2682587 - Yeah. He's quitting, so help him, okay?<br />- I quit.
2683297 2685298 I was only looking at it.
2687259 2689969 Ah. First thing is the fat.
2690137 2692638 Everybody says, "Cut the fat. "
2692806 2695474 My uncle said,<br />"You cut the fat, you kill the burger. "
2695642 2697393 - Yep.<br />- There's an art to this.
2697560 2699604 You just can't plop this on the grill.
2702649 2705443 Gently coax the flavors out.
2707070 2708654 - Yo, hey.<br />- What's the problem?
2715954 2719332 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2719499 2723127 Just a little bit. Sweet, sweet meat.
2726173 2727798 Shit, man, feel it.
2731595 2734472 Okay, guys. L.A.P.D.<br />Let me see your hands.
2734932 2737141 Come on, let me see your hands.<br />Get them up!
2737309 2740770 In the car. Get them up there.<br />Let me see both of them. Come on!
2745400 2747026 Hey, Riggs.
2754952 2756327 Riggs!
2756954 2759455 God, don't you love me? Five days.
2767214 2769048 Don't do that shit to me.
2769216 2770633 - Riggs, you okay?<br />- Yeah.
2770800 2772843 Come on. Who did it?
2775055 2778015 All right, asshole.<br />I wanna see your hands right now.
2804918 2806377 Back me up, Riggs!
2832154 2833904 Darryl?
2839578 2841954 Oh, fuck, no. Darryl!
2845250 2848919 Call an ambulance.<br />Riggs, call an ambulance. Breathe.
2849463 2852715 Breathe.
2852883 2855134 Call an ambulance, Riggs.
2855969 2858054 Hey, come on. Breathe. Oh, God.
2858220 2859889 Fuck, it's Darryl.
2860599 2861974 Darryl, breathe.
2862142 2863809 God, don't do this to me. Breathe.
2863977 2865644 - He's dead, Rog.<br />- Fucking breathe!
2865812 2869065 - Breathe! God, don't do this.<br />- He's dead, Rog.
2869232 2871609 He's dead, Rog. Rog, he's dead.
2871777 2873903 He's dead, Rog.<br />Don't mess with it, man.
2874070 2877656 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2877824 2879700 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
2879868 2881869 He was gonna do you,<br />he was gonna do me.
2882496 2883662 It's okay. You okay?
2884623 2886332 It's not okay.
2886666 2889335 - What?<br />- I know that kid.
2891670 2892963 I know that kid.
2894508 2896509 He's Nick's friend.
2914194 2916153 - Got it, Mom.<br />- I'll get it.
2916320 2919532 Hello? Hi, Martin.
2919950 2921450 He's not here.
2928750 2930835 Oh, my God.
2933420 2935047 Thanks.
2963994 2965911 Fuck. Fuck.
2971793 2973586 How you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2973753 2975880 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
2976047 2977423 Morning, captain.
2977590 2980593 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
2980760 2983804 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- I don't think that's a good idea.
2983972 2986557 I think the best thing you could do<br />is leave him alone.
2986725 2990269 - Let's, uh, get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about, Riggs.
2991270 2994565 - You and I have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
2994733 2996567 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
2996735 2998986 Well, in that case,<br />let's find somewhere private.
2999154 3001280 Here, step into my orifice.
3003992 3005618 Here.
3007037 3008537 Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
3008705 3009955 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yeah.
3010123 3013751 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- No, I haven't done that for a couple days.
3013919 3016170 - Next time, wait for the bomb squad.<br />- Bomb squad.
3016338 3017421 Yeah, it's our job.
3017589 3020382 Okay, I'll remember that. We saved a cat.<br />What do you want?
3020550 3023260 - Great. I love cats.<br />- Hey.
3024387 3026013 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
3026180 3029975 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
3030143 3033520 - Yeah, damn right I did.<br />- Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
3033688 3036440 You had a tip on Travis,<br />you should have shared it with me.
3036608 3038234 No, I take that back.
3038400 3040986 You were required to share it with me.
3041154 3043530 - I was required to share it with you?<br />- Yeah.
3043698 3045658 I don't have to share shit with you.
3045825 3049078 If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
3049246 3051997 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that.<br />- Yes, you can.
3052165 3055084 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit?
3055252 3057419 Right now. It's giving me the shits!
3057587 3060339 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're on the same side.
3060507 3061674 - Right? Right?<br />- Right!
3061840 3064927 Right? Good.<br />Why don't we start to act like it, huh?
3065095 3067012 Come on, there's kids out there. Babies.
3067180 3069181 No brains,<br />but they got automatic weapons.
3069349 3072476 - Yesterday, my partner, he nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
3074396 3077356 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.
3078316 3079900 Yeah.
3082820 3084196 Look, uh...
3084656 3087157 Look, why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3087325 3090536 I really wanna help you, if you'll let me.<br />Let me.
3090704 3092788 Come on, what do you say?<br />We got a deal?
3096710 3098043 Wash your hands, Riggs.
3100630 3103507 And, um, meet me in my office.
3103842 3107344 Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll be right there.
3109180 3110222 Be right there.
3111099 3112850 MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...
3113018 3116145 - ... converted to automatic...<br />- With 36 rounds in the magazine.
3116313 3119982 On a sesame-seed bun. Very illegal.
3120150 3123068 - That gun has a history. Wanna know it?<br />- Tell me.
3126573 3129199 Killed a convenience-store clerk<br />in L.A. County, July 1990.
3129367 3133787 Was used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.
3133955 3138917 Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the L.A. School Board, October 1990.
3139085 3141712 Scheduled for destruction by the L.A.P.D.<br />six weeks ago.
3141880 3144340 - Scheduled for destruction?<br />- Yeah.
3144507 3146508 But it never got there.
3148553 3151513 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3151680 3153932 ...who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3154100 3157436 - Thought it looked familiar.<br />- That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3157604 3161231 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3161399 3164401 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3164569 3168113 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3168280 3172493 ...to get these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed right back out.
3172660 3175204 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3175372 3177456 ...the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3177624 3181001 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3181169 3183754 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3183922 3186173 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3186340 3188634 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3188802 3191595 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3191763 3194473 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3194766 3196809 - Right. Travis.<br />- Travis.
3199479 3201563 And you let him slip<br />through your fingers.
3202816 3206276 - That's closer than you ever got.<br />- Close, Riggs?
3206444 3209488 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3212200 3215619 - You wanna go for a ride?<br />- Sure, where we going?
3215995 3217579 Surprise.
3222252 3224336 Oh, I love surprises.
3224587 3225963 What is this place?
3226130 3228632 I accessed Billy Phelps'<br />phone records on my computer.
3228800 3230592 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3230760 3232928 - Yeah?<br />- Nice of you to steal that information.
3233096 3234138 Semantics, Riggs.
3234305 3237349 Semantics? I'm always up for some antics.
3238059 3242855 - All right, let's go on three. One...<br />- Uh, on three, or three and then go?
3243022 3244731 - What?<br />- Never mind. One, two, three.
3248110 3249528 Gotcha.
3263376 3265461 Looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3265628 3267212 That isn't a dog. That's a horse.
3267880 3269840 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3270467 3272676 - I don't get it.<br />- You don't get what?
3272844 3274803 That's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3274970 3280017 No, I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window. " I don't get that.
3280185 3282060 Riggs, later.
3286357 3289067 - What are you doing?<br />- Well, I can't shoot a dog.
3289235 3290903 People, okay, but not dogs.
3291070 3293530 I think I should try<br />and make friends with him.
3293698 3296033 - Make friends?<br />- Yeah.
3296200 3299912 Now, don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3300079 3301663 Uh-huh.
3302373 3305292 Here, boy. Here, boy.
3312717 3315427 - Here. Good boy. Yes.<br />- Shit.
3322769 3324019 Riggs.
3329400 3330692 You're crazy.
3350797 3353757 Want one? Want one?<br />You hungry? Huh?
3355468 3356969 You're a hungry boy.
3357136 3359471 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3359889 3361890 What a good fella.
3362058 3364351 Here. Here's more. Leave some for me.
3364519 3368480 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3368648 3371733 - You want me to go?<br />- Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3371900 3374695 - Guy sort of thing?<br />- Are you all alone in here?
3383997 3385163 Stay, stay.
3387292 3389001 Come on, let's go.
3399970 3401847 - Let's go. Let's go.<br />- Watch.
3402015 3403348 On two.
3410189 3412065 - All right, how many is that?<br />- Fifty-five.
3412233 3415527 Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.
3415695 3417904 All right, we'll get these later. Let's go.
3421534 3424870 Hi, fellas. What's in all these boxes?
3435798 3439968 Easy, let's not kill him yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3442347 3443889 You have the right to remain silent.
3444057 3445807 Shut him up.
3445975 3448185 Sergeant Martin Riggs, heh.
3450229 3452314 - Hubie, get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
3452482 3453982 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3454150 3455734 ...how did you find us?
3455902 3457194 Freeze. Police!
3458863 3460072 Oh, another one?
3460490 3462074 We need a new fucking dog.
3462240 3464076 Get your hands up, asshole.
3464243 3466078 Get them up.
3469374 3471583 A little bit higher. That's better.
3473086 3474711 Very good.
3478675 3480509 Drop it, miss.
3482178 3483428 Now, look...
3531477 3533937 Okay, I'm on. No, I'm not. I'm off! Wait!
3534105 3536773 Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
3540236 3543613 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Get down! Get down!
3547160 3548744 Get those cases and kill that dog.
3560965 3563341 Stop! The dog. Wait for the dog.
3563509 3566428 - Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog.
3566596 3570015 Here, boy. Come on. We're waiting<br />for the dog. Just hold it, hold it.
3570183 3573518 Hurry. Come on, dog.<br />Good dog. Good puppy. Go! Go!
3576022 3577189 Stop!
3577356 3579191 - What? What?<br />- Guns.
3579358 3580484 - Full of guns.<br />- Grab one.
3580650 3582360 - You grab one.<br />- You got friends?
3582528 3583987 Step on it!
3587700 3589701 Get that crate. Come on.
3595540 3597876 Hatchett, you said<br />not to worry about the police...
3598044 3599920 ...but the cops are all over you, man.
3600087 3602464 They got my guns.<br />They'll be coming after me next.
3602632 3604800 Far as I'm concerned, the deal's off.
3604967 3608136 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone, all right?<br />We have a deal.
3608304 3609721 Nobody backs out.
3609889 3611890 You said you had the cops under control.
3612058 3615727 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason<br />why I should do business with you.
3615895 3619815 - I'll give you a real good reason.<br />- Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.
3619982 3624110 You back out now, and I'll make certain<br />that only your dentist can identify the body.
3624278 3626571 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3628990 3630700 But I need ammo.
3630868 3632786 I'm out of business without ammo.
3632954 3637040 - I need the good stuff.<br />- You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3638250 3639960 "The good stuff. " Jesus. Pfft!
3640127 3642254 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3644423 3646132 You look like I feel.
3656435 3659479 Hey. Hey.
3659647 3661857 You got anything I can put on my head?
3662024 3663400 There's a hat in the closet.
3663568 3668154 You're all heart. Here I thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3668322 3670740 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3670908 3672158 We got hurt all the time...
3672326 3675579 ...but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3675746 3678123 - Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />- It's not gushing.
3678290 3680959 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3681335 3683295 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3683462 3686923 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3688968 3691887 - Don't touch anything.<br />- I wasn't. I didn't...
3693639 3695348 What's with you, anyway?
3710656 3713700 - The boys.<br />- Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3713868 3716494 - I told you not to touch anything.<br />- Uh, this came on by itself.
3716662 3718914 - Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />- I swear.
3719080 3720999 You don't like to share your toys?
3721167 3722918 - This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />- What is it?
3723085 3724836 - This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />- A weapon?
3725004 3727005 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3727173 3729466 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3729634 3732344 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3732510 3733511 Right here.
3733679 3735847 - Okay, take a little off the top.<br />- Right here.
3742020 3744356 - You bring all your interrogations home?<br />- Okay.
3744523 3746983 - What are we talking about?<br />- Well, it's back here.
3747150 3748526 Careful. Careful.
3748694 3750195 - Careful. Oh.<br />- This?
3750363 3752864 - This scratch?<br />- Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3753032 3754824 - Oh, God.<br />- Ah!
3754992 3756451 - Hold still.<br />- Yeah.
3756619 3760580 - Ah!<br />- Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3760748 3761998 Be gentle with me.
3762750 3765377 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3765544 3769422 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3769674 3772217 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3772385 3773677 - Look at that.<br />- It's a knife.
3773844 3775971 - Knife? That's very knife.<br />- Mm-hm.
3776263 3777305 This is all right.
3777473 3779891 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3780059 3783061 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3783229 3785230 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3785398 3788316 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3788484 3790652 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3790820 3792904 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck? Ooh!
3793072 3794489 - Moving bullet.<br />- Moving bullet?
3794657 3796408 - Here. This is the best.<br />- Bullets now.
3797159 3799995 - It goes all the way to the back.<br />- Oh, hey. Right through?
3800162 3801746 You're lucky. What is it,.22?
3801914 3803415 - It's a. 38, Riggs.<br />- That's a. 38?
3803582 3806418 - It's a. 38.<br />- That's a wimpy. 38. This is a. 38.
3806585 3809504 - Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />- I think so.
3809672 3810922 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3811090 3814259 A whole family of. 44s on the back.
3814427 3816511 - Look, there they are.<br />- Impressive.
3816679 3820056 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3820224 3821516 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3821684 3823560 - You got one?<br />- Mm.
3823728 3825353 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3825646 3827105 - Oh, yeah.<br />- Mm-hm.
3827648 3830358 - Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />- Oh.
3830526 3831735 - That must've hurt.<br />- Right.
3831902 3832944 - Not too close.<br />- Pfft!
3833112 3835030 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3835197 3837949 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3838117 3840368 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3840536 3843288 - I'll take your word.<br />- This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3843456 3846082 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3846500 3849127 - Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />- I'll take your word for it.
3849295 3850420 No, I said forget it.
3850588 3853506 - This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />- Forget it, Riggs.
3854592 3855633 Hey, you started this.
3855800 3858470 - Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3858929 3860305 You're a very poor loser.
3861766 3862974 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3863142 3864893 - Yes, you did.<br />- No. No, I didn't lose.
3865060 3866644 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3866812 3869230 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3869398 3871066 You conceded or you're conceited?
3871233 3873318 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Oh, yeah.
3873486 3875653 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3875820 3876863 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3877030 3880158 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
3891879 3894422 You're gonna smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3895299 3897217 I can do better than that, Riggs.
3914318 3917695 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
3917988 3920156 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.
3920324 3921991 Shut up, Riggs.
3976922 3978423 Oh!
3980300 3982927 Oh, damn, Riggs.
3984722 3988141 - What do you want, Riggs?<br />- Just wanted to see how you were doing.
3988309 3989684 Who sent you? Trish?
3989852 3992478 Well, uh, you're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3992646 3995190 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3995357 3997942 - Your place?<br />- Well, that's where I am.
3998110 4002280 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Yeah.
4002448 4004908 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- What the hell?
4005075 4006701 Come on, Roger, she was worried.
4006869 4008786 Get off of my boat, Riggs.
4008954 4010788 - Oh, come on.<br />- Get off my boat.
4010956 4012290 Look, you're drunk, Rog.
4012458 4014626 That's something<br />you should know about, huh?
4014793 4016878 - This isn't gonna do any good.<br />- Give me that.
4017046 4018463 - No.<br />- Give me that.
4018630 4020465 Rog, please don't do this, okay?
4020633 4023968 You got three days until you retire.<br />This is not gonna do you any good.
4024136 4026512 - You self-righteous bastard. Give it.<br />- Roger!
4026680 4030391 - Look, don't do this, okay? Please.<br />- Give it to me, damn it, Riggs!
4030559 4034103 No! Oh, Jesus Christ.<br />What are you gonna do now, shoot me?
4034270 4035897 - Uh-huh.<br />- There.
4036065 4038650 Take your finger out of my bottle<br />and give me that gun.
4038817 4039984 The bottle's going south.
4041528 4043112 Son of a bitch.
4044990 4046824 Oh, shit.
4047785 4050453 - Not bad for an old man.<br />- You finished?
4050620 4053039 I got another bottle in the galley.<br />I'm gonna get it.
4053207 4056542 No, you're not.<br />Rog, don't do this to yourself, all right?
4056710 4059128 You gotta cut this out.
4059797 4062173 Oh, man, I'm sorry.<br />Are you okay? Are you okay?
4062340 4064717 All right. Sit down. Sit down. You okay?
4066095 4067845 - You hit me.<br />- Cool it, will you?
4068013 4069764 Cut it out. Just give it up, okay?
4069932 4071015 Go ahead.
4071183 4073184 Go ahead. Hit me again.
4073352 4075687 I don't wanna hit you.<br />You think I like this shit?
4075854 4078606 Hit me again, huh?<br />You think I'm afraid of you?
4078774 4081276 - I know you're not. Rog, no!<br />- Of that kung fu shit?
4081443 4082902 Please, Rog.
4083737 4085738 Look, that kid was a killer, all right.
4085906 4087323 That wasn't a toy in his hand.
4087490 4090785 That was a machine pistol<br />with twin carbines and all the trimmings.
4090953 4094497 He would have drilled you, me,<br />anybody that came along, all right?
4094665 4096207 You had no choice.
4096542 4098793 It didn't happen to you.<br />It happened to me.
4098960 4100336 It happened to me!
4100504 4102463 My God, I killed that kid.
4102630 4104173 I killed that boy.
4104340 4106217 Oh, yeah. You kill a lot of people.
4106385 4110054 You kill a fucking lot of people!<br />You ever kill a baby?
4110222 4113391 You got ice in your veins.<br />You ever kill a boy like Nick?
4113559 4116894 You selfish bastard! You selfish bastard!
4117062 4119355 You're just thinking about yourself!<br />Goddamn it.

4124862 4126487 What happens to you, happens to me.
4126655 4129741 After all the shit we've been through,<br />don't you get it?
4130034 4131367 Don't you get it?
4132286 4135538 When you retire, you're not just<br />retiring you, you're retiring us.
4135706 4137957 - You're retiring us.<br />- No. That's not my problem.
4138125 4139751 - Yes, it is.<br />- It's not my problem.
4139918 4141753 You're the only family I've got.

4169698 4172784 I had three days, and now this.
4173410 4174952 I'm sorry.
4175120 4177288 - That's all right.<br />- No, no, I'm sorry.
4178957 4180375 I didn't realize...
4180542 4182627 ...that my retirement's<br />gonna screw you up.
4182795 4187006 Forget it. I haven't got any problems.<br />I was out of line saying that shit.

4546240 4550119 - And you're pulling on the wrong string.<br />- That's not a very professional attitude.
4550287 4552538 - Who the fuck are you guys?<br />- Sorry. L.A.P.D.

4697850 4699310 Hey, Murphy.
4699477 4702980 - People cross the street when they see me.<br />- I didn't have enough time.
4703148 4706525 I'm not your enemy, captain.<br />I'm just trying to do my job.
4707027 4709987 - Have you eaten?<br />- I already ate. I gotta go downtown.
4710155 4712239 - What, do you eat alone?<br />- I'm used to it.
4712407 4713657 It's bad for the digestion.
4713825 4716535 Tomorrow you have lunch with me,<br />but I'm not paying.

4753323 4757201 You wanna try something? Watch this.<br />This is called a backspin kick.
4757369 4759036 Pivot right, kick with your left...
4759204 4762331 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4762499 4764375 Get that head round and follow through.
4764542 4767544 Like so. So you whip the head.
4769005 4770547 All right?
4770715 4772883 Thank you. Thank you. Now you try it.

4811089 4812881 Sergeant Murtaugh.
4813049 4818053 You could be experiencing some<br />transitional anger caused by the shooting.
4818220 4820472 You wanna talk about it?
4821140 4823559 - I think he's okay for a change, doc.<br />- Are you sure?
4823727 4827354 Yeah. You know, you really look good<br />in red. That's your color, I think.
4827730 4831567 - I've got a little extra time now, sergeant.<br />- I'm fine, doctor.
4836614 4837614 Oh, shit.

4848918 4851128 - Delores. You remember me?<br />- I remember you.
4851296 4854465 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4854632 4858469 As a matter of fact, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4861056 4864224 - Listen, where's the sergeant?<br />- He's not here at the moment, Delores.
4864392 4866810 But, uh, he's talked of nothing<br />but you all week.
4866978 4868812 - Shut my mouth.<br />- The man's on fire.
4868980 4871023 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
4871190 4874401 Oh. You tell him Delores was here.
4874569 4876445 You tell that man...
4876613 4878655 ...that he's the jam in my jelly roll.
4880033 4883410 - I'll see you, baby, okay? Bye-bye.<br />- Okay. Bye.
4885663 4888540 Delores says that you're<br />the jam in her jelly roll. That's...
4888708 4890542 - I heard.<br />- Heh.
4890710 4892628 - That's a lot of woman there.<br />- Shit.
4892796 4896507 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4896674 4900177 - You shouldn't have led her on.<br />- Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4900345 4904348 I mean, if Trish finds out about it...<br />I didn't... I didn't...
4904682 4907351 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4907519 4910145 You've gotta come see me.
4910313 4912564 Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
4912732 4915651 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Yeah. Thanks, doc.
4915902 4917152 - You're a beauty.<br />- Coming?
4917320 4919196 A beauty. Yeah, I'm coming.
4926788 4928705 Afternoon, captain.
4930375 4933502 - That's good, Murphy.<br />- See how easy that was?
4937507 4939258 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4939425 4943679 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4947392 4949226 Give me the lock-up keys.
4949769 4952563 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4952730 4954731 And all busted by<br />the same police officer...
4954899 4956984 ...Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4957152 4958902 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4959070 4962573 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4962740 4965492 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4965660 4966910 - What?<br />- May I see your pass?
4967078 4968871 - Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />- I do.
4969038 4971623 - I got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />- He's with us.
4971790 4973333 - He's with us?<br />- Did I say that?
4973500 4976753 - Where'd you get her from?<br />- What are you doing out of the hospital?
4976920 4979423 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4979590 4982176 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4982343 4984303 - Brain surgery?<br />- No, a lapotomy.
4984470 4986763 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4986930 4987973 What's the difference?
4988140 4992227 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4992395 4995564 - Nether what?<br />- Your nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4995732 4997191 Well, point to it.
4998650 4999943 - Okay. Here.<br />- Must be itchy.
5000110 5002529 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5002697 5005782 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5005950 5007451 Huh? Huh?
5008828 5011288 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5011456 5013123 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5013290 5015459 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5015627 5017044 - You know what I say?<br />- What?
5017212 5020964 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5021132 5022341 And when they're done...
5022508 5025594 ...along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5025762 5028805 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5028973 5030265 - Leo!<br />- That's enough.
5030433 5031975 - We're trying to work here.<br />- Okay.
5032143 5034978 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5035146 5036730 You take an ad out in the paper?
5036898 5039483 - He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />- Who's she?
5039650 5041777 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5041945 5043654 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
5043820 5045781 - I get it.<br />- Real estate right now but...
5045949 5048283 Hey, listen. Come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5048450 5050619 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5050787 5052371 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5052538 5055832 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5056000 5059336 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs...
5059504 5062130 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5062298 5065801 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5065969 5068679 - Okay. Sure, I can do this.<br />- Remember that name?
5068846 5070681 Right around... Mesa Verde, I got it.
5070848 5073183 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5073350 5075185 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5075353 5077229 - Who is that guy?<br />- It's a long story.
5083528 5084945 Here are your keys, captain.
5086364 5088073 - You motherfucker.<br />- Don't be stupid.
5088240 5090826 - The fuck?<br />- Take the elevator, bring the other guys.
5090994 5092786 Keys. Give me your fucking hands.
5093788 5097332 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5098000 5100085 Stand there.
5103506 5106008 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5106175 5108927 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5109095 5111972 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5113016 5116601 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.
5116769 5119104 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
5119272 5121398 World of computers, Murph.<br />World of computers.
5121566 5124234 You used to be one of us,<br />for chrissakes, Jack.
5124402 5127487 You know what future<br />a cop has, Murph? None.
5127655 5130741 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5130992 5132284 Pension.
5132785 5133827 Nothing to do.
5133995 5137414 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Well, not for this kid.
5137582 5139708 Police department's got it all:
5139876 5143045 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.<br />It's a one-stop shopping center.
5143212 5146590 If you got the brains, there's not<br />a thing anybody can do about it.
5146758 5149426 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5149594 5151928 Sorry, Murph.<br />But I'm just getting started.
5152430 5154431 - Something's wrong here.<br />- What?
5154599 5157059 The program's been accessed<br />by somebody from the outside.
5157226 5158727 What? What's been accessed?
5158895 5162481 After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
5162648 5164858 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Thousands of rounds...
5165026 5167611 ...to a more secured location. Shit.
5167779 5169654 - That's been accessed.<br />- Somebody knows.
5169822 5172032 Where's it stored?<br />Where did they move it?
5173368 5174868 - Wait, wait.<br />- Let's go.
5175036 5178497 - I guess I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- Where is it?
5178664 5179956 - In the building.<br />- Where?
5180124 5181875 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something going down?
5182043 5184002 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
5184170 5185962 - Uh, how old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
5186130 5189466 Twenty-two? Come on.<br />You got protection?
5189634 5192386 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy.
5192553 5193637 Should we take him?
5193805 5196348 Okay, but keep your head down.<br />Keep your head down.
5196516 5197933 - Stay behind me.<br />- Come on, let's go.
5198100 5199309 - Yahoo!<br />- Shh! Quiet.
5211656 5213281 See, you were my ticket in, Murph.
5213866 5216493 It's too bad<br />you won't be coming with me.
5220623 5221873 Travis.
5222040 5223875 - They got it all.<br />- Shit.
5224585 5226545 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
5226712 5229172 - I don't know.<br />- They didn't take it upstairs.
5229340 5231299 Hey, hey. Elevator.
5233886 5236513 - Shit. It's down.<br />- Hey, the subway's down there.
5236680 5238598 - We take the stairs.<br />- L.A. has subways?
5238766 5239808 Where you been, kid?
5239976 5241852 Read something besides the funny pages.
5242895 5245355 All right, guys. Come on, let's hustle.
5247900 5249693 Hurry up, guys.
5262373 5263790 L.A.P.D., guys. Come here.
5263958 5265834 Come here. Step on it.
5266460 5268128 Son of a bitch.
5268296 5270088 You see anybody, anything strange?
5270256 5274801 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
5275219 5276887 - I'm going across.<br />- I got it.
5283978 5285770 Get rid of Murphy, now!
5291486 5293570 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
5305958 5307334 Split. Get out of here.
5309128 5310670 Cover me.
5316510 5317844 Riggs!
5330858 5332609 Let's go. Let's go!
5336489 5338365 Riggs.
5341869 5343787 Son, stay still.
5353798 5355924 Happy birthday, kid.
5365643 5366810 Oh, shit!
5381617 5382993 Another baby.
5395380 5397340 Hey! Is he dead? Check the body.
5397508 5399175 Get me the fuck out of here, will you?
5400845 5402637 Hey, Riggs! Hey, Riggs!
5402930 5405348 Riggs! You stupid son of a bitch.
5417278 5419362 Stop that shit. Cut it out.
5419530 5421364 - Hey! Don't shoot.<br />- L.A.P.D., man.
5421532 5422782 Where does this come out?
5422950 5424326 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks, pal.
5424493 5425535 Hey, not that way.
5425703 5428455 - Take the stairs, man, it's faster.<br />- Okay, thanks.
5439258 5440383 Ow!
5440550 5442761 Sorry, pal. Where's the tunnel?<br />Gangway!
5450728 5452520 Get out of the way.
5455524 5458068 Holy shit. Son of a bitch.
5458903 5460111 Police!
5467078 5469162 Step on it! There he is! Step on it!
5470790 5472248 Goddamn.
5477088 5479047 Put your foot down!
5485096 5486763 I can't!
5506117 5509452 - Hey, police! I need your bike, man.<br />- What? This is bullshit.
5509620 5514082 I need your bike. Sergeant Riggs, call it in.<br />I need a couple clips too.
5529557 5531307 Hey, we lost him.
5538440 5540567 - Central, where's Riggs?<br />- Six-William-Six.
5540735 5543069 Central, keep me in touch<br />with motorcycle pursuit.
5550660 5552328 - Shit.<br />- Take a right, now.
5552496 5553913 Take a right! Go!
5554665 5556499 Go! Go! Go!
5557500 5559794 Stupid. Take a right. No, left!
5571348 5572348 Shit!
5577313 5578480 Oh, shit!
5594830 5596539 Watch it!
5600628 5602670 This is 6-William-6, this is 6-William-6.
5602838 5604547 I'm at the freeway construction site.
5604715 5607592 Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?<br />Come back to me, Central.
5607760 5609511 Six-William-Six, location west...
5609678 5611221 Where's Riggs? Where the hell is Riggs?
5612807 5615350 Take a left here. Get off.<br />Get off the freeway.
5616727 5617977 Oh, Jesus!
5627738 5628738 Stop! Hold it!
5630574 5631658 Oh, shit!
5632535 5633952 Hang on.
5636247 5637413 Stop!
5649176 5650218 Where is the pursuit?
5654515 5655932 Oh, shit.
5668320 5672448 - Riggs! Hey, just relax, Riggs.<br />- Relax?
5674200 5675410 Riggs! Riggs!
5675744 5678371 Oh, shit!
5684420 5686129 Riggs! Riggs!
5689758 5692969 Riggs. Hey, Riggs.
5693178 5695305 Get back. Just get back. Get back!
5695973 5698308 Riggs, talk to me. Riggs.
5698475 5701227 Riggs, you're alive. Come here.
5701395 5704480 Don't move. Don't move.<br />I said just get back!
5705316 5706649 You all right?
5708986 5710695 Hey, hey, hey, Riggs, don't...
5710863 5712238 Hey, hey, Riggs!
5713782 5714949 Don't touch me!
5715117 5717994 Okay, okay. I'm not touching you.<br />I'm not touching you.
5718162 5720413 - Just be careful.<br />- Don't touch me. Don't!
5724460 5727253 - Don't touch me.<br />- Hey, okay, I won't touch you.
5727420 5728588 I'm not touching you.
5731050 5735845 - Okay. You okay now?<br />- I'm pissed now, Rog. Now I'm pissed.
5736013 5737513 - Now what?<br />- That son of a bitch.
5737680 5739599 He's done it twice now. Damn.
5739767 5742644 Son of a... I'm gonna suck<br />his eyes out through his nose.
5742895 5745021 Twice he got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me!
5745189 5748024 Okay. Just relax. Just relax.
5748359 5750193 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5750360 5752862 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
5755574 5756866 Hey!
5757450 5758952 - Hey, I'm having that.<br />- You quit!
5759119 5761329 I ran out of biscuits, all right?<br />Give me a break.
5763040 5766876 Oh, shit.
5771548 5772715 Perfect.
5773800 5775969 - What did I miss?<br />- What's he doing here?
5776136 5778346 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
5778514 5780473 - Great chase.<br />- What are you doing here?
5780640 5782475 - How'd you find us, huh?<br />- My police scanner.
5782643 5784644 What are you doing<br />with a police scanner?
5784812 5789148 What am I...? Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
5789316 5791651 Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
5791819 5794195 They got a housing project<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
5794363 5796823 - I know where that is.<br />- Why don't we check it out?
5796990 5799617 - Good idea.<br />- Okay, hey, wait. I'll come with you.
5799785 5802620 - No, you're not coming.<br />- Yes, I am. I'll take my car.
5802788 5804580 - No, you're not.<br />- Yes, I am.
5806333 5809460 I can't believe you did that.<br />I got a spare in the trunk.
5812423 5814090 - You're driving.<br />- No, I'm driving.
5814258 5816968 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5817136 5819595 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- Hey, where's Lorna?
5819763 5821931 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- With Walters.
5822599 5825351 I can't belie... I can't believe you did that.
5825519 5827687 How could you do that to me?
5828772 5830940 Did you see that? They're my partners.
5831108 5833776 - I can't believe they did that.<br />- Twenty-one and 18, clear.
5833944 5835278 Excuse me, do you own your home?
5869146 5871814 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
5871982 5873816 Move on out to Travis Town.
5873984 5876235 Great place to raise a family.
5876737 5878905 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5879073 5881783 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got, isn't it?
5881950 5884327 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5884912 5887371 - Say, is that, uh...?<br />- It's Darryl's gun.
5887539 5890208 - Saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is the right occasion.
5890375 5892293 How many men you think he has?
5892460 5894837 Who knows? Maybe I should<br />run over there and ask him?
5895005 5896547 - That'd be too easy.<br />- Yeah.
5896757 5898841 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5899009 5900802 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5900969 5903888 Hey, I wonder what Murphy's got<br />in his trunk.
5906183 5908643 Well, it's obvious Murph was<br />never a Boy Scout.
5909103 5910686 - Not even a good spare.<br />- Yeah.
5912356 5913689 Shit.
5914775 5916526 Put your hands down. It's embarrassing.
5919822 5921948 - How you doing?<br />- Kissing, huh?
5922116 5925451 - Fresh ones, huh?<br />- Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
5925619 5926911 Don't get points for those.
5927079 5928955 - How did you get here?<br />- Drove.
5929123 5931624 - No, no. How...?<br />- I ran into Leo at the police station.
5931792 5933334 - He talked to me first.<br />- Leo, Leo.
5933502 5935545 - Any ideas?<br />- Lucky thing we got a plan.
5935712 5937547 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, lucky thing. What is it?
5937714 5942635 - Oh, no. I want it to be a surprise.<br />- Oh, I like surprises.

5950894 5953437 - Let's check it out.<br />- Let's go.
5970372 5972957 - Look what they did to Murph's car.<br />- Could've been worse.
5973125 5975376 - Could've been yours.<br />- Could've been Trish's.

5987930 5989056 Oh, shit!
5999234 6001194 - Go! Go! Let's go!<br />- Yeah, yeah.
6008910 6011412 What's wrong with you?<br />I said go on three, not two.
6011580 6012955 - Nobody goes on two.<br />- On three!
6013123 6015291 - Three. It's always three.<br />- Boys! Boys!
6016543 6018836 What are we doing here?<br />Losing our heads in a crisis?

6046823 6048658 - Hey, Rog!<br />- Murtaugh!
6049576 6050868 - What?<br />- Count to 20.
6051787 6054497 - What?<br />- Count to 20, then light me!
6059002 6060336 Shit!
6062673 6064465 Riggs, it's loaded with ammo.
6078397 6079855 - Cover me.<br />- Cover you?
6081608 6083442 Cover you, cover Riggs.<br />Cover everybody.
6083610 6086195 When's somebody gonna cover me<br />for a change?
6090993 6093452 What's that, 13, 14? Ah, to hell with it.
6109886 6112555 Jack, it's the cops.<br />They're burning everything.
6116018 6117059 God!
6124109 6126944 Son of a bitch. Shit. Crazy motherfucker!
6131116 6134076 Damn. Riggs, the ammo.<br />Get out of there.
6150594 6154555 - Riggs, you crazy son of a bitch.<br />- Yeah! Ha, ha!
6170072 6171906 Son of a bitch. It works. Shit.
6176453 6180122 Stay there. That shit works, Riggs.<br />Riggs!
6193678 6194804 Son of a bitch. No clip.
6197766 6199475 Lorna, no, don't!
6206149 6207483 Come on in, bitch.
6208150 6209985 - Door's open.<br />- Aah!

6305999 6307041 Hey, Riggs.
6313924 6316634 Riggs! Hey, Riggs. Riggs!
6319137 6323140 Riggs! Get up! Get up, Riggs!<br />Get up! Get up!
6323517 6325100 Killed in the line of duty, Riggs!
6329564 6332441 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the department, Riggs!
6337780 6340115 Hey, Riggs. Cop killers.
6352254 6353796 Ex-cop killers.
6364266 6365975 Go to hell, Riggs.
6367310 6368686 You first.
6377570 6380322 Hey, Riggs! Crazy son of a bitch.
6386538 6389039 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
6389207 6391208 Oh. Oh.
6391376 6393335 Just hold still. Hold still.
6393503 6395546 Hey, get a chopper, man. Get a chopper.
6395839 6397923 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
6398090 6400301 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
6400468 6404346 Okay. You're all right, partner.<br />You're all right. All right. Hang on. Okay.
6404973 6407933 It's okay, it's okay.<br />Just lie still. Just lie still.
6408100 6411312 Just a romantic evening<br />by the fire, just the two of us.
6411563 6412771 Just be still.
6416067 6419528 - Lock and load!<br />- I got it.
6422824 6425326 Honey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
6425994 6427536 Open your eyes.
6431040 6433042 What are you trying to prove<br />out there, huh?
6433418 6434835 Huh? Why do you do that?
6435503 6437254 - Can I take this off?<br />- Yeah.
6439299 6441258 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone...
6441426 6443052 ...not because of them, all right?
6449184 6450559 I'm gonna be with you, Lorna.
6451353 6453354 Hey, I'm with you now.<br />Look, I'm right here.
6453520 6455564 We're both here, right? Right.
6457442 6459401 Come on, I wanna be with you.
6459569 6461445 What have you got to lose?
6462364 6463405 You.
6465533 6466867 Not likely.
6472332 6474541 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
6476795 6478879 Let's live to regret this, huh?
6482800 6484843 - Okay, we've gotta go, sarge.<br />- Okay.
6485387 6487096 She's gonna be fine.
6490809 6492226 Can you hear me?
6493728 6494770 I love you.
6512372 6516375 Happy retirement, Daddy
6517293 6521171 Happy retirement, Daddy
6521630 6523799 This is it. This is the day.
6524676 6525759 Everybody? Daddy?
6525927 6529054 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the force.
6529222 6531014 - Yes. A lot of years.<br />- That's a lot.
6531182 6533183 - Come on, you have to blow it out.<br />- Come on.
6533350 6535936 - Blow them out.<br />- Blow them out. Come on.
6536104 6537479 - I can't.<br />- Come on, we'll help.
6537647 6541442 - No, that's not what I mean.<br />- What?
6541943 6543819 I can't retire.
6544863 6547030 I thought I could. I wanted to.
6548450 6549992 But I can't.
6553830 6555831 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the force?
6555999 6558167 That means I'm staying<br />with the force, baby.
6561546 6565674 This cake's about to explode,<br />so, uh, you better blow out these candles.
6565842 6569553 But, um, Dad, I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6570220 6572097 - Yeah, me too.<br />- So am I, Dad.
6572265 6574516 - It's okay.<br />- Well, the streets will be safer...
6574684 6575768 ...for another couple years.
6578605 6581315 - Word, Nick.<br />- Word, Dad.
6584402 6585944 Blow them out.
6586988 6588155 Hello?
6588323 6590532 - Hello. Up here!<br />- Hello?
6590700 6594119 - Hello. Hey, I gotta talk to Roger.<br />- Leo.
6594287 6595370 Oprah should see this.
6595538 6598040 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6598208 6599666 Leo, what is it?
6599834 6602836 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6603004 6605047 - Okay, okay.<br />- I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6605215 6608175 I can see that. And it's cold water too.<br />There goes your image.
6608343 6611261 - Leo.<br />- Listen, I got great news, okay?
6611429 6614598 Okay? Once again,<br />Leo Getz has delivered.
6614766 6616892 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6617769 6622189 This termite-infested dump<br />is now gone. Okay?
6622357 6625734 You have to sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6625902 6627110 Okay? I did it. I did it.
6627278 6628737 - Hey, hey. Leo, Leo.<br />- What?
6628905 6630405 The house is off the market.
6630573 6634535 We're gonna stay in this termite-infested<br />turkey for another 10 years.
6634702 6636662 - At least.<br />- I'll get married in here.
6636830 6639331 - Come on, you guys. Come on, out.<br />- You can't do this.
6639499 6641291 - Out, out.<br />- No, you can't do that.
6641459 6644086 - You too, Leo.<br />- You can't do that.
6644254 6645420 I have contracts signed.
6645588 6647840 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6648007 6651552 - Partners?<br />- You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6651719 6652761 - Why?<br />- Why?
6652929 6655597 Bullets aren't covered in normal<br />road hazard. That's why.
6655765 6659434 - I want those tires! No conditions!<br />- Oh, God. Leo, get out of here.
6659602 6662104 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Get out. Leo, out, out!
6662272 6664398 You're lucky your wife's here.<br />You're lucky...
6664566 6665607 - Out!<br />- Okay.
6668820 6671113 - Don't come to me if the...<br />- Get out!
6671280 6674157 - Termites get... Okay, okay.<br />- No more!
6676660 6679454 - Your friends.<br />- Yeah.
6679914 6682833 Ten more years<br />till forced retirement, huh, baby?
6684002 6688171 That's, uh, 3650 days.
6688339 6691133 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6701936 6704021 - I'll try and improve my image.<br />- Mm.
6710945 6714823 - See you soon. Thanks a lot.<br />- Don't mention it.
6714990 6716992 Oh, bye, Daddy.
6719329 6720829 Bye, baby.
6730006 6732549 - What are you smiling at?<br />- Heh.
6732717 6735886 - Why weren't you at my party, huh?<br />- I knew you weren't gonna retire.
6736054 6739806 I've been wrong about a couple things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6739974 6742142 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6742310 6744937 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6745104 6748148 - What dog-biscuit problem?<br />- I've been chasing more cars lately...
6748316 6751360 ...and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6751860 6755656 Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey.<br />I'm driving. Other side.
6755823 6758742 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6758910 6760410 Thank you for opening the door.
6760578 6764081 - Need some help? An old fella like you...<br />- I'll show you a fella my age.
6764248 6766083 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6767502 6769044 - You know something, Riggs?<br />- What?
6769212 6772965 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6773508 6777052 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6777220 6778553 Well, he did it to me.
6779639 6781056 I know.
6781808 6783266 See what I mean?
6785395 6788647 - My point, exactly.<br />- Son of a bitch. Shit.
6791943 6793443 Stay away from my daughter.
6793610 6795904 - You can't be serious.<br />- What are you talking about?
6796072 6797906 I saw what it was. You kissed Rianne.
6798074 6799908 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6800076 6803036 - That's not the point.<br />- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6803204 6805831 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6805999 6809042 - Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber.
6809210 6810585 I'm spoken for, okay?
6810753 6813380 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6813548 6815424 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah, we're practically...
6815590 6818010 - You're serious?<br />- We got a dog and everything.
6818177 6820804 I figure I can, uh, you know,<br />make ends meet.
6829439 6832607 All units. All units. Code 2, high.
6832775 6835402 Hey, don't even think<br />about it, Riggs. Don't even try.
6835570 6838697 This is us, rolling to Code 2, high,<br />at Verrina Place.
6838865 6841658 - Shit, Riggs.<br />- This time we wait for the bomb squad.
6841826 6844411 You think I want to end up<br />in uniform again?
7027010 7031181 20-William-12,<br />the REA bomb squad's en route. All units.
7031349 7033141 Those guys gonna get in the way again?
7033309 7036102 Okay, there it is. You happy? Let's go.
7036270 7038271 Ah, we ain't seen nothing yet, though, Rog.
7038439 7040982 - Come on, just get me up there closer.<br />- It's roped off.
7041150 7043526 - Can't see the bomb squad.<br />- They're coming.
7043694 7046655 - Okay, all right. All right.<br />- Stop here and I'll just get out.
7046822 7049574 No, don't get out<br />of the car, Riggs. No. Riggs!
7049742 7052035 Tell me, Rog, was it red wire, blue...?
7052286 7054496 Let's get out of here!<br />Step on the gas.
7054664 7056081 They'll never believe this.
7056249 7058833 - I hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame me.
7059000 7062254 Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
7062420 7064256 They'll say, "Back in uniform again. "
7064423 7067050 - Find one that fits.<br />- Ten more years of this.
7067218 7070178 I'm too old for this shit.
